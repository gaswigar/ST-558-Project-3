carlingford
is
as
is
well
known
essentially
a
quiet
place
there
is
no
trade
in
the
town
properly
so
called
to
be
sure
there
are
two
or
three
small
at
the
other
end
of
george
street
in
that
ambitious
pile
called
gresham
chambers
but
the
owners
of
these
places
of
business
live
as
a
general
rule
in
villas
either
detached
or
in
the
the
new
quarter
which
as
everybody
knows
is
a
region
totally
unrepresented
in
society
in
carlingford
proper
there
is
no
trade
no
manufactures
no
anything
in
particular
except
very
pleasant
parties
and
a
superior
class
of
people
a
very
superior
class
of
people
indeed
to
anything
one
expects
to
meet
with
in
a
country
town
which
is
not
even
a
county
town
nor
the
seat
of
any
particular
interest
it
is
the
boast
of
the
place
that
it
has
no
particular
interest
not
even
a
public
school
for
no
reason
in
the
world
but
because
they
like
it
have
so
many
nice
people
collected
together
in
those
pretty
houses
in
grange
lane
which
is
of
course
a
very
much
higher
tribute
to
the
town
than
if
any
special
inducement
had
led
them
there
but
in
every
community
some
centre
of
life
is
necessary
this
point
round
which
everything
circles
is
in
carlingford
found
in
the
clergy
they
are
the
administrators
of
the
commonwealth
the
only
people
who
have
defined
and
compulsory
duties
to
give
a
sharp
outline
to
life
somehow
this
touch
of
necessity
and
business
seems
needful
even
in
the
most
refined
society
a
man
who
is
obliged
to
be
somewhere
at
a
certain
hour
to
do
something
at
a
certain
time
and
whose
public
duties
are
not
volunteer
proceedings
but
indispensable
work
has
a
certain
position
of
command
among
a
leisurely
and
unoccupied
community
not
to
say
that
it
is
a
public
boon
to
have
some
one
whom
everybody
knows
and
can
talk
of
the
minister
in
salem
chapel
was
everything
in
his
little
world
that
respectable
connection
would
not
have
hung
together
half
so
closely
but
for
this
perpetual
subject
of
discussion
criticism
and
patronage
and
to
compare
great
things
with
small
society
in
carlingford
recognised
in
some
degree
the
same
human
want
an
enterprising
or
rector
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
grange
lane
and
in
the
absence
of
a
rector
that
counted
for
anything
and
poor
mr
proctor
was
of
no
earthly
use
as
everybody
knows
it
followed
as
a
natural
consequence
that
a
great
deal
of
the
interest
and
influence
of
the
position
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
but
that
position
was
one
full
of
difficulties
as
any
one
acquainted
with
the
real
state
of
affairs
must
see
in
a
moment
mr
circumstances
were
on
the
whole
as
delicate
and
critical
as
can
be
imagined
both
as
respected
his
standing
in
carlingford
and
the
place
he
held
in
his
own
family
not
to
speak
of
certain
other
personal
matters
which
were
still
more
troublesome
and
vexatious
these
last
of
course
were
of
his
own
bringing
on
for
if
a
young
man
chooses
to
fall
in
love
when
he
has
next
to
nothing
to
live
upon
trouble
is
sure
to
follow
he
had
quite
enough
on
his
hands
otherwise
without
that
crowning
complication
when
mr
wentworth
first
came
to
carlingford
it
was
in
the
days
of
mr
bury
the
evangelical
rector
his
last
days
when
he
had
no
longer
his
old
vigour
and
was
very
glad
of
assistance
as
he
said
in
his
public
and
parish
work
mr
bury
had
a
friendship
of
old
standing
with
the
miss
wentworths
of
skelmersdale
mr
francis
wentworth
aunts
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
old
rector
eyes
were
opened
to
the
astounding
fact
that
the
nephew
of
these
precious
and
chosen
women
held
views
of
the
most
dangerous
complexion
and
indeed
was
as
near
rome
as
a
strong
and
lofty
conviction
of
the
really
superior
catholicity
of
the
anglican
church
would
permit
him
to
be
before
he
found
this
out
mr
bury
who
had
unlimited
confidence
in
preaching
and
improving
talk
had
done
all
he
could
to
get
the
young
man
to
work
as
the
good
rector
called
it
and
had
voluntarily
placed
all
that
difficult
district
about
the
canal
under
the
charge
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
it
is
said
that
the
horror
with
which
after
having
just
written
to
miss
leonora
wentworth
to
inform
her
what
a
great
work
his
young
friend
was
doing
among
the
bargemen
mr
bury
was
seized
upon
entering
st
roque
itself
for
the
first
time
after
the
consecration
when
the
young
priest
had
arranged
everything
his
own
way
had
a
very
bad
effect
on
his
health
and
hastened
his
end
and
it
is
indeed
a
fact
that
he
died
soon
after
before
he
had
time
to
issue
the
interdict
he
intended
against
mr
wentworth
further
exertions
in
the
parish
of
carlingford
then
came
mr
proctor
who
came
into
the
town
as
if
he
had
dropped
from
the
skies
and
knew
no
more
about
managing
a
parish
than
a
baby
and
under
his
exceptional
incumbency
mr
wentworth
became
more
than
ever
necessary
to
the
peace
of
the
community
now
a
new
had
been
inaugurated
mr
morgan
a
man
whom
miss
wodehouse
described
as
in
the
prime
of
life
newly
married
with
a
wife
also
in
the
prime
of
life
who
had
waited
for
him
ten
years
and
all
that
time
had
been
under
training
for
her
future
duties
two
fresh
new
active
clergymanly
intellects
entirely
open
to
the
affairs
of
the
town
and
intent
upon
general
reformation
and
sound
management
had
just
come
into
possession
the
new
rector
was
making
a
great
stir
all
about
him
as
was
natural
to
a
new
man
and
it
seemed
on
the
whole
a
highly
doubtful
business
whether
he
and
mr
wentworth
would
find
carlingford
big
enough
to
hold
them
both
we
could
not
have
expected
to
begin
quite
without
difficulties
said
mrs
morgan
as
she
and
her
husband
discussed
the
question
in
the
of
the
rectory
it
was
a
pretty
though
mr
proctor
taste
was
not
quite
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
the
new
incumbent
wife
however
as
the
furniture
was
all
new
and
as
the
former
rector
had
no
further
need
for
it
it
was
of
course
much
the
best
and
most
economical
arrangement
to
take
it
as
it
stood
though
the
bouquets
on
the
carpet
were
a
grievance
which
nothing
but
her
high
christian
principles
could
have
carried
mrs
morgan
through
she
looked
round
as
she
spoke
and
gave
an
almost
imperceptible
shake
of
her
head
she
too
had
her
share
of
disagreeables
it
would
not
look
like
christ
work
dear
said
the
clergyman
wife
if
we
had
it
all
our
own
way
my
dear
i
hope
i
am
actuated
by
higher
motives
than
a
desire
to
have
it
all
my
own
way
said
the
rector
i
always
felt
sure
that
proctor
would
make
a
mess
of
any
parish
he
took
in
hand
but
i
did
not
imagine
he
would
have
left
it
to
anybody
who
pleased
to
work
it
you
may
imagine
what
my
feelings
were
when
i
came
upon
a
kind
of
impromptu
chapel
in
that
wretched
district
near
the
canal
i
thought
it
a
little
bethel
you
know
of
course
but
instead
of
that
i
find
young
wentworth
goes
there
wednesdays
and
fridays
to
do
duty
and
that
there
is
service
on
sunday
evening
and
i
ca
tell
what
besides
it
may
be
done
from
a
good
motive
but
such
a
disregard
of
all
constituted
authority
said
the
rector
with
involuntary
vehemence
can
never
in
my
opinion
be
attended
by
good
results
mr
wentworth
did
you
say
said
mrs
morgan
upon
whose
female
soul
the
perpetual
curate
good
looks
and
good
manners
had
not
been
without
a
certain
softening
effect
i
am
so
sorry
i
do
wonder
you
are
vexed
but
do
you
think
there
must
be
some
mistake
william
mr
wentworth
is
so
gentlemanly
and
nice
and
of
very
good
family
too
i
do
think
he
would
choose
to
set
himself
in
opposition
to
the
rector
i
think
there
must
be
some
mistake
it
a
very
aggravating
mistake
at
all
events
said
mr
morgan
rising
and
going
to
the
window
it
was
as
we
have
said
a
very
pretty
and
the
windows
opened
upon
as
pretty
a
bit
of
lawn
as
you
could
see
with
one
handsome
cedar
sweeping
its
dark
branches
majestically
over
delicious
greensward
but
some
people
did
think
it
was
too
near
george
street
and
the
railway
just
at
that
moment
a
puff
of
delicate
white
vapour
appeared
over
the
wall
and
a
sudden
just
released
from
the
cover
of
the
station
sprang
with
a
snort
and
bound
across
the
rector
view
very
imperfectly
veiled
by
the
which
were
thin
in
their
foliage
as
yet
mr
morgan
groaned
and
retreated
out
of
his
first
exaltation
he
had
descended
all
at
once
as
people
will
do
after
building
all
their
hopes
upon
one
grand
event
into
great
depression
and
vexation
when
he
found
that
after
all
this
event
did
not
change
the
face
of
existence
but
indeed
brought
new
proofs
of
mortality
in
the
shape
of
special
annoyances
belonging
to
itself
in
its
train
on
the
whole
said
the
rector
who
was
subject
to
fits
of
disgust
with
things
in
general
i
am
tempted
to
think
it
was
a
mistake
coming
to
carlingford
the
drawbacks
quite
overbalance
the
advantages
i
did
hesitate
i
remember
it
must
have
been
my
better
angel
that
is
my
dear
he
continued
recollecting
himself
i
would
have
hesitated
had
it
not
been
for
you
here
there
ensued
a
little
pause
mrs
morgan
was
not
so
young
as
she
had
been
ten
years
ago
all
which
time
she
had
waited
patiently
for
the
fellow
of
and
naturally
these
ten
years
and
the
patience
had
not
improved
her
looks
there
was
a
redness
on
her
countenance
nowadays
which
was
not
exactly
bloom
and
it
stretched
across
her
cheeks
and
over
the
point
of
her
nose
as
she
was
painfully
aware
poor
lady
she
was
silent
when
she
heard
this
wondering
with
a
passing
pang
whether
he
was
sorry
but
being
a
thoroughly
sensible
woman
and
above
indulging
in
those
little
appeals
by
which
foolish
ones
confuse
the
calm
of
matrimonial
friendship
she
did
not
express
the
momentary
feeling
yes
william
she
said
sympathetically
casting
her
eyes
again
on
the
objectionable
carpet
and
feeling
that
there
drawbacks
even
to
her
happiness
as
the
wife
of
the
rector
of
carlingford
but
i
suppose
every
place
has
its
disadvantages
and
then
there
is
such
good
society
and
a
town
like
this
is
the
very
place
for
your
talents
and
when
affairs
are
in
your
own
hands
it
is
very
easy
talking
said
the
vexed
rector
society
and
everybody
would
turn
upon
me
if
i
interfered
with
wentworth
the
vexation
the
fellow
goes
about
it
as
if
he
had
a
right
why
there
a
provident
society
and
all
sorts
of
things
going
on
exactly
as
if
it
were
his
own
parish
what
led
me
to
the
place
was
seeing
some
ladies
in
grey
cloaks
exactly
such
frights
as
you
used
to
make
yourself
my
dear
flickering
about
he
has
got
up
a
sisterhood
i
have
no
doubt
and
to
find
all
this
in
full
operation
in
one
own
parish
without
so
much
as
being
informed
of
it
and
you
know
i
approve
of
sisterhoods
never
did
they
are
founded
on
a
mistake
yes
dear
i
know
i
gave
up
as
soon
as
i
knew
your
views
on
that
subject
said
mrs
morgan
i
daresay
so
will
the
ladies
here
who
were
they
did
you
speak
to
them
or
perhaps
they
belonged
to
st
roque
nobody
belongs
to
st
roque
said
the
rector
contemptuously
it
has
not
even
a
district
they
were
the
two
miss
wodehouses
mrs
morgan
was
moved
to
utter
a
little
cry
and
their
father
is
churchwarden
said
the
indignant
woman
really
william
this
is
too
much
without
even
consulting
you
but
it
is
easy
to
see
how
comes
about
lucy
wodehouse
and
young
wentworth
are
well
i
know
if
they
are
engaged
but
they
are
always
together
walking
and
talking
and
consulting
with
each
other
and
so
forth
a
great
deal
more
than
i
could
approve
of
but
that
poor
elder
sister
you
know
has
no
authority
nor
indeed
any
experience
poor
thing
said
the
rector
wife
that
how
it
is
no
doubt
engaged
said
the
rector
he
gave
a
kindly
glance
at
his
wife
and
melted
a
little
engaged
are
they
poor
little
thing
i
hope
she
be
as
good
as
you
have
been
my
dear
but
a
young
man
may
be
in
love
without
interfering
with
another
man
parish
i
ca
forgive
that
said
mr
morgan
recovering
himself
he
must
be
taught
to
know
better
and
it
is
very
hard
upon
a
clergyman
continued
the
spiritual
ruler
of
carlingford
that
he
can
not
move
in
a
matter
like
this
without
incurring
a
storm
of
godless
criticism
if
i
were
sending
wentworth
out
of
my
parish
i
should
wonder
if
the
had
an
article
upon
it
denouncing
me
as
an
indolent
priest
and
bigot
that
would
neither
work
myself
nor
let
my
betters
work
that
how
these
fellows
talk
but
nobody
could
say
such
things
of
you
said
mrs
morgan
firing
up
of
me
they
say
them
of
st
paul
if
he
had
ever
been
in
the
circumstances
said
the
rector
and
i
should
just
like
to
know
what
he
would
have
done
in
a
parish
like
this
with
the
dissenters
on
one
side
and
a
perpetual
curate
without
a
district
meddling
on
the
other
ah
my
dear
continued
mr
morgan
i
daresay
they
had
their
troubles
in
those
days
but
facing
a
governor
or
so
now
and
then
or
even
passing
a
night
in
the
stocks
is
a
very
different
thing
from
a
in
the
not
to
speak
of
the
complications
of
duty
let
us
go
out
and
call
at
folgate
and
see
whether
he
thinks
anything
can
be
done
to
the
church
dear
you
would
mind
the
if
it
were
your
duty
said
the
rector
wife
getting
up
promptly
to
prepare
for
the
walk
no
i
suppose
not
said
mr
morgan
not
without
a
thrill
of
importance
nor
the
stake
he
added
with
a
little
laugh
for
he
was
not
without
a
sense
of
humour
and
the
two
went
out
to
the
architect
to
ascertain
the
result
of
his
cogitations
over
the
church
they
passed
that
sacred
edifice
in
their
way
and
went
in
to
gaze
at
it
with
a
disgust
which
only
an
unhappy
priest
of
high
culture
and
aesthetic
tastes
doomed
to
officiate
in
a
building
of
the
eighteenth
century
of
the
churchwarden
period
of
architecture
could
fully
enter
into
eugh
said
mr
morgan
looking
round
upon
the
high
pews
and
stifling
galleries
with
an
expressive
contraction
of
his
features
his
wife
looked
on
sympathetic
and
it
was
at
this
unlucky
moment
that
the
subject
of
their
late
conference
made
his
appearance
cheerfully
from
behind
the
ugly
pulpit
in
close
conference
with
mr
folgate
the
pulpit
was
a
mass
with
the
and
the
clerk
desk
beneath
a
terrible
eyesore
to
the
rector
and
his
wife
i
can
fancy
the
expediency
of
keeping
the
place
in
repair
said
the
curate
of
st
roque
happy
in
the
consciousness
of
possessing
a
church
which
though
not
old
had
been
built
by
gilbert
scott
and
cheerfully
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
his
listeners
but
to
beautify
a
wretched
old
barn
like
this
is
beyond
the
imagination
of
man
money
ca
do
everything
said
the
heedless
young
man
as
he
came
lounging
down
the
middle
aisle
tapping
contemptuously
with
his
cane
upon
the
high
i
wonder
where
the
people
expected
to
go
to
who
built
carlingford
church
curious
continued
the
young
anglican
stopping
in
mid
career
to
think
of
bestowing
upon
anything
so
hideous
what
a
pass
the
world
must
have
come
to
folgate
when
this
erection
was
counted
worthy
to
be
the
house
of
god
after
all
perhaps
it
is
wrong
to
feel
so
strongly
about
it
the
walls
consecrated
though
they
are
ugly
we
ca
revoke
the
blessing
but
no
wonder
it
was
an
unchristian
age
we
have
our
treasure
in
earthen
vessels
said
mr
morgan
somewhat
sternly
from
where
he
stood
under
shelter
of
the
heavy
gallery
mr
wentworth
was
shortsighted
like
most
people
nowadays
he
put
up
his
glass
hastily
and
then
hurried
forward
perhaps
just
a
little
abashed
when
he
had
made
his
salutations
however
he
returned
undismayed
to
the
charge
it
a
great
pity
you
have
not
something
better
to
work
upon
said
the
dauntless
curate
but
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
what
can
be
done
with
such
an
unhallowed
type
of
construction
i
was
just
saying
to
folgate
there
is
a
great
deal
of
cant
abroad
on
this
subject
said
mr
morgan
interrupting
the
young
oracle
i
like
good
architecture
but
i
do
relish
attributing
moral
qualities
to
bricks
and
mortar
the
hallowing
influence
ought
to
be
within
mr
folgate
we
were
going
to
call
at
your
office
have
you
thought
of
the
little
suggestions
i
ventured
to
make
oh
the
drawings
are
here
mr
wentworth
does
not
approve
of
them
i
suppose
said
the
rector
turning
sternly
round
upon
the
unlucky
curate
of
st
roque
i
can
only
say
i
sympathise
with
you
profoundly
said
young
wentworth
with
great
seriousness
such
a
terrible
church
must
be
a
great
trial
i
wish
i
had
any
advice
worth
offering
but
it
is
my
hour
for
a
short
service
down
at
the
canal
and
i
ca
keep
my
poor
bargees
waiting
good
morning
i
hope
you
come
and
give
us
your
countenance
mrs
morgan
there
no
end
of
want
and
trouble
at
wharfside
is
mr
wentworth
aware
i
wonder
that
wharfside
is
in
the
parish
of
carlingford
said
the
rector
with
involuntary
severity
as
the
young
priest
withdrew
calmly
to
go
to
his
duty
mr
folgate
who
supposed
himself
to
be
addressed
smiled
and
said
oh
yes
of
course
and
unfolded
his
drawings
to
which
the
clerical
pair
before
him
lent
a
disturbed
attention
they
were
both
in
a
high
state
of
indignation
by
this
time
it
seemed
indispensable
that
something
should
be
done
to
bring
to
his
senses
an
intruder
so
perfectly
composed
and
at
his
ease
chapter
ii
meanwhile
mr
wentworth
without
much
thought
of
his
sins
went
down
george
street
meaning
to
turn
off
at
the
first
narrow
turning
which
led
down
behind
the
shops
and
traffic
behind
the
comfort
and
beauty
of
the
little
town
to
that
inevitable
land
of
shadow
which
always
dogs
the
sunshine
carlingford
proper
knew
little
about
it
except
that
it
increased
the
and
now
and
then
produced
a
fever
the
minister
of
salem
chapel
was
in
a
state
of
complete
ignorance
on
the
subject
the
late
rector
had
been
equally
uninformed
mr
bury
who
was
evangelical
had
the
credit
of
disinterring
the
buried
creatures
there
about
thirty
years
ago
it
was
an
office
to
be
expected
of
that
man
but
what
was
a
great
deal
more
extraordinary
was
to
find
that
the
only
people
now
in
carlingford
who
knew
anything
about
wharfside
except
overseers
of
the
poor
and
guardians
of
the
public
peace
were
the
perpetual
curate
of
st
roque
who
had
nothing
particular
to
do
with
it
and
who
was
regarded
by
many
persons
with
suspicion
as
a
dilettante
anglican
given
over
to
floral
ornaments
and
ecclesiastical
upholstery
and
some
people
of
the
very
of
society
principally
ladies
residing
in
grange
lane
mr
wentworth
came
to
a
hesitating
pause
at
the
head
of
the
turning
which
would
have
led
him
to
wharfside
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
there
was
half
an
hour
to
spare
he
gave
a
wistful
lingering
look
down
the
long
line
of
pausing
upon
one
point
where
the
blossomed
boughs
of
an
overlooked
that
enclosure
there
was
quite
time
to
call
and
ask
if
the
miss
wodehouses
were
going
down
to
the
service
this
afternoon
but
was
it
duty
or
indeed
putting
that
question
aside
was
it
quite
right
to
compound
matters
with
his
own
heart
desire
and
the
work
he
was
engaged
in
in
this
undeniable
fashion
the
young
priest
crossed
the
street
very
slowly
swinging
his
cane
and
knitting
his
brows
as
he
debated
the
question
if
it
had
been
one
of
the
bargemen
bringing
his
sweetheart
walking
with
her
along
the
side
of
the
canal
to
which
spring
and
sweet
easter
coming
on
and
love
perhaps
always
helpful
of
illusions
might
convey
a
certain
greenness
and
sentiment
of
nature
and
echoing
her
soft
responses
to
the
afternoon
prayers
perhaps
the
curate
might
have
felt
that
such
devotion
was
not
entirely
pure
and
simple
but
somehow
before
he
was
aware
of
it
his
slow
footstep
had
crossed
the
line
and
he
found
himself
in
grange
lane
bending
his
steps
towards
mr
wodehouse
door
for
one
thing
to
be
sure
the
canticles
in
the
evening
service
could
always
be
sung
when
lucy
sweet
clear
voice
was
there
to
lead
the
uncertain
melody
and
it
was
good
to
see
her
singing
the
with
that
serious
sweet
face
full
of
grace
like
mary
own
thinking
of
that
mr
wentworth
made
his
way
without
any
further
hesitation
to
the
green
door
over
which
hung
the
totally
untroubled
in
his
mind
as
to
what
the
reverend
pair
were
thinking
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
in
the
ugly
church
and
unconscious
that
his
impromptu
chapel
at
wharfside
with
its
little
carved
and
the
table
behind
contrived
so
as
to
look
suspiciously
like
an
altar
was
a
thorn
in
anybody
side
had
his
mind
been
in
a
fit
condition
at
that
moment
to
cogitate
trouble
his
thoughts
would
have
travelled
in
a
totally
different
direction
but
in
the
mean
time
mr
wentworth
was
very
well
able
to
put
aside
his
perplexities
the
green
door
opened
just
as
he
reached
it
and
lucy
and
her
elder
sister
came
out
in
those
grey
cloaks
which
the
rector
had
slandered
they
were
just
going
to
wharfside
to
the
service
and
of
course
they
were
surprised
to
see
mr
wentworth
who
did
not
knock
at
that
green
door
more
than
a
dozen
times
in
a
week
on
the
average
the
curate
walked
between
the
sisters
on
their
way
towards
their
favourite
district
such
a
position
would
scarcely
have
been
otherwise
than
agreeable
to
any
young
man
dear
old
miss
wodehouse
was
the
gentlest
of
chaperones
old
miss
wodehouse
people
called
her
not
knowing
why
perhaps
because
that
adjective
was
sweeter
than
the
harsh
one
of
middle
age
which
belonged
to
her
and
then
there
was
such
a
difference
between
her
and
lucy
lucy
was
twenty
and
in
her
sweetest
bloom
many
people
thought
with
mr
wentworth
that
there
were
not
other
two
such
eyes
in
carlingford
not
that
they
were
brilliant
or
penetrating
but
as
blue
as
heaven
and
as
serene
and
pure
so
many
persons
thought
and
the
perpetual
curate
among
them
the
grey
cloak
fell
in
pretty
folds
around
that
light
elastic
figure
and
there
was
not
an
old
woman
in
the
town
so
tender
so
helpful
so
handy
as
lucy
where
trouble
was
as
all
the
poor
people
knew
so
the
three
went
down
prickett
lane
which
leads
from
george
street
towards
the
canal
not
a
pleasant
part
of
the
town
by
any
means
and
if
mr
wentworth
was
conscious
of
a
certain
haze
of
sunshine
all
round
and
about
him
gliding
over
the
poor
pavement
and
here
and
there
transfiguring
some
baby
bystander
gazing
at
the
pretty
lady
could
any
reasonable
man
be
surprised
i
hope
your
aunts
were
quite
well
mr
wentworth
when
you
heard
from
them
last
said
miss
wodehouse
and
all
your
people
at
home
in
such
a
small
family
as
ours
we
should
go
out
of
our
wits
if
we
did
not
hear
every
day
but
i
suppose
it
is
different
where
there
are
so
many
lucy
when
she
goes
from
home
said
the
tender
elder
sister
glancing
at
her
with
a
admiration
and
she
might
always
be
visiting
about
if
she
liked
writes
to
me
every
day
i
have
nobody
who
cares
for
me
enough
to
write
every
week
said
the
curate
with
a
look
which
was
for
lucy
benefit
i
am
not
so
lucky
as
you
my
aunts
are
quite
well
miss
wodehouse
and
they
think
i
had
better
go
up
to
town
in
may
for
the
meetings
added
mr
wentworth
with
a
passing
laugh
and
the
rest
of
my
people
are
very
indignant
that
i
am
not
of
their
way
of
thinking
there
is
tom
burrows
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
he
is
trying
to
catch
eye
said
the
curate
turning
round
upon
lucy
for
the
young
man
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
he
could
not
address
her
in
an
ordinary
and
proper
way
like
other
people
but
because
he
dared
not
yet
call
her
by
her
christian
name
as
if
she
belonged
to
him
had
a
strange
rude
way
of
indicating
when
he
was
speaking
to
her
by
emphasis
and
action
it
was
singularly
different
from
his
usual
but
lucy
somehow
rather
liked
it
than
otherwise
he
is
not
going
to
church
for
the
sake
of
the
service
he
is
going
to
please
he
has
never
forgotten
what
you
did
for
that
little
boy
of
his
and
indeed
if
you
continue
to
go
on
so
said
mr
wentworth
lowering
his
voice
and
more
than
ever
bending
his
tall
head
to
one
side
i
shall
have
to
put
a
stop
to
it
somehow
for
i
am
not
prepared
whatever
people
say
to
go
in
at
once
for
worship
of
the
saints
i
am
going
in
here
to
call
said
lucy
she
looked
up
very
innocently
in
the
curate
face
i
promised
the
poor
sick
woman
in
the
back
room
to
see
her
every
day
and
i
could
not
get
out
any
sooner
i
daresay
i
shall
be
at
the
schoolroom
before
you
begin
just
now
said
the
young
sister
of
mercy
she
went
off
all
at
once
on
this
provoking
but
unexceptionable
errand
looking
with
calm
eyes
upon
the
dismay
which
overspread
the
expressive
countenance
of
her
spiritual
guide
mr
wentworth
stood
looking
after
her
for
a
moment
stunned
by
the
unexpected
movement
when
he
went
on
truth
compels
us
to
own
that
a
thrill
of
disgust
had
taken
the
place
of
that
vague
general
sense
of
beatitude
which
threw
beauty
even
upon
prickett
lane
the
curate
gave
but
a
sulky
nod
to
the
salutation
of
tom
burrows
and
walked
on
in
a
savage
mood
by
the
side
of
miss
wodehouse
around
whom
no
nimbus
of
ideal
glory
hovered
i
am
always
afraid
of
its
being
too
much
for
her
mr
wentworth
said
the
anxious
elder
sister
it
upsets
me
directly
but
then
i
never
was
like
lucy
i
ca
tell
where
all
you
young
people
have
learned
it
we
never
used
to
be
taught
so
in
my
day
and
though
i
am
twice
as
old
as
she
is
i
know
i
am
not
half
so
much
good
in
the
world
said
the
kind
soul
with
a
gentle
sigh
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
a
parish
of
your
own
where
you
would
have
it
all
your
own
way
i
hope
mr
morgan
wo
be
meddling
when
he
comes
to
have
time
for
everything
i
should
almost
think
he
would
though
it
seems
unkind
to
say
it
by
his
face
i
am
doing
nothing
more
than
my
duty
said
the
perpetual
curate
in
morose
tones
this
district
was
given
into
my
hands
by
the
late
rector
mr
morgan
face
does
not
matter
to
me
but
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
a
parish
of
your
own
said
miss
wodehouse
meaning
to
please
him
you
know
papa
always
says
so
st
roque
is
very
nice
but
if
you
wish
me
out
of
the
way
miss
wodehouse
i
am
sorry
to
say
you
are
not
likely
to
be
gratified
said
the
curate
for
i
have
no
more
expectation
of
any
preferment
than
you
have
such
chances
do
come
in
everybody
way
but
i
thought
your
aunts
mr
wentworth
said
poor
miss
wodehouse
who
unluckily
did
not
always
know
when
to
stop
my
aunts
do
approve
of
my
principles
answered
mr
wentworth
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
speaking
with
a
little
asperity
they
are
more
likely
to
have
me
denounced
at
exeter
hall
i
will
join
you
immediately
i
must
speak
to
these
men
across
the
street
and
the
curate
accordingly
walked
into
a
knot
of
loungers
opposite
with
a
decision
of
manner
which
lucy
desertion
had
helped
him
to
miss
wodehouse
thus
left
alone
went
on
with
lingering
and
somewhat
doubtful
steps
she
was
not
used
to
being
in
the
district
by
herself
it
disturbed
her
mild
habits
to
be
left
straying
about
here
alone
among
all
these
poor
people
whom
she
looked
at
half
wistfully
half
alarmed
feeling
for
them
in
her
kind
heart
but
not
at
all
knowing
how
to
get
at
them
as
the
young
people
did
the
unruly
children
and
gossiping
mothers
at
the
poor
doors
discomposed
her
sadly
and
she
was
not
near
so
sure
that
her
grey
cloak
defended
her
from
all
rudeness
as
she
pretended
to
be
when
assenting
to
the
enthusiasm
of
mr
wentworth
and
lucy
she
made
tremulous
haste
to
get
out
of
this
scene
which
she
was
not
adapted
for
to
the
shelter
of
the
schoolroom
where
at
least
she
would
be
safe
we
never
were
taught
so
in
my
day
she
said
to
herself
with
an
unexpressed
wonder
which
was
right
but
when
she
had
reached
that
haven
of
shelter
was
seized
with
a
little
panic
for
lucy
and
went
out
again
and
watched
for
her
at
the
corner
of
the
street
feeling
very
uncomfortable
it
was
a
great
relief
to
see
her
young
sister
coming
down
alert
and
bright
even
before
she
was
joined
by
mr
wentworth
who
had
carried
his
point
with
the
men
he
had
been
talking
to
to
see
them
coming
down
together
smiling
to
all
those
people
at
the
doors
who
disturbed
the
gentle
mind
of
miss
wodehouse
with
mingled
sentiments
of
sympathy
and
repulsion
bestowing
nods
of
greeting
here
and
there
pausing
even
to
say
a
word
to
a
few
favoured
clients
was
a
wonderful
sight
to
the
timid
maiden
lady
at
the
corner
of
the
street
twenty
years
ago
some
such
companion
might
have
been
by
miss
wodehouse
side
but
never
among
the
poor
people
in
prickett
lane
even
with
lucy
before
her
she
did
not
understand
it
as
the
two
came
towards
her
other
thoughts
united
with
these
in
her
kind
soul
i
wonder
whether
anything
will
ever
come
of
it
she
said
to
herself
and
with
that
wandered
into
anxious
reflections
what
this
difference
could
be
between
mr
wentworth
and
his
aunts
which
cogitations
indeed
occupied
her
till
the
service
began
and
perhaps
disturbed
her
due
appreciation
of
it
for
if
lucy
and
mr
wentworth
got
attached
as
seemed
likely
and
mr
wentworth
did
not
get
a
living
what
was
to
come
of
it
the
thought
made
this
spectator
sigh
perhaps
she
had
some
experience
of
her
own
to
enlighten
her
on
such
a
point
at
least
it
troubled
with
sympathetic
human
cares
the
gentle
soul
which
had
lost
the
confidence
of
youth
as
for
the
two
most
immediately
concerned
they
thought
nothing
at
all
about
aunts
or
livings
whether
it
is
the
divine
influence
of
youth
or
whether
the
vague
unacknowledged
love
which
makes
two
people
happy
in
each
other
presence
carries
with
it
a
certain
inspiration
this
at
least
is
certain
that
there
is
an
absolute
warmth
of
devotion
arrived
at
in
such
moments
which
many
a
soul
no
longer
happy
would
give
all
the
world
to
reach
such
crowds
and
heaps
of
blessings
fall
to
these
young
souls
they
said
their
prayers
with
all
their
hearts
not
aware
of
deriving
anything
of
that
profound
sweet
trust
and
happiness
from
each
other
but
expanding
over
all
the
rude
but
reverend
worshippers
around
them
with
an
unlimited
faith
in
their
improvement
almost
in
their
perfection
this
was
what
the
wondering
scarcely
able
to
keep
her
anxieties
out
of
her
prayers
could
not
understand
having
forgotten
though
she
did
not
think
so
the
exaltation
of
that
time
of
youth
as
people
do
she
thought
it
all
their
goodness
that
they
were
able
to
put
away
their
own
thoughts
she
did
not
know
it
was
in
the
very
nature
of
those
unexpressed
emotions
to
add
the
confidence
of
happiness
to
their
prayers
and
after
a
while
they
all
separated
and
went
away
back
into
the
world
and
the
everyday
hours
young
wentworth
and
lucy
had
not
said
a
syllable
to
each
other
except
about
the
people
in
the
district
and
the
provident
society
and
how
that
sober
and
laudable
conversation
could
be
called
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
most
ardent
imagination
to
conceive
he
was
to
dine
with
them
that
evening
so
it
was
for
but
a
very
brief
time
that
they
parted
when
the
perpetual
curate
left
the
ladies
at
the
green
door
and
went
away
to
his
room
to
attend
to
some
other
duties
before
he
arrayed
himself
for
the
evening
as
for
the
sisters
they
went
in
quite
comfortably
and
had
their
cup
of
tea
before
they
dressed
for
dinner
lucy
was
manager
indoors
as
well
as
out
she
was
good
for
a
great
deal
more
than
miss
wodehouse
in
every
practical
matter
it
was
she
who
was
responsible
for
the
dinner
and
had
all
the
cares
of
the
house
upon
her
head
notwithstanding
the
elder
sister
took
up
her
prerogative
as
they
sat
together
in
two
very
cosy
in
a
little
room
which
communicated
with
both
their
a
very
cosy
little
odd
room
not
a
nor
a
boudoir
but
something
between
the
two
where
the
sisters
had
their
private
talks
upon
occasion
and
which
was
consecrated
by
many
a
libation
of
fragrant
tea
lucy
my
dear
said
miss
wodehouse
whose
gentle
forehead
was
puckered
with
care
i
want
to
speak
to
you
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
you
out
of
my
mind
since
ever
we
met
mr
wentworth
at
the
green
door
was
there
any
need
for
getting
me
out
of
your
mind
said
smiling
lucy
i
was
a
safe
enough
inmate
surely
i
wonder
how
often
i
am
out
of
your
mind
mary
dear
night
or
day
that
is
true
enough
said
miss
wodehouse
but
you
know
that
is
not
what
i
meant
either
lucy
are
you
quite
sure
you
going
on
just
as
you
ought
here
she
made
a
troubled
pause
and
looked
in
the
laughing
face
opposite
intent
upon
her
with
its
startled
eyes
what
have
i
done
cried
the
younger
sister
miss
wodehouse
shook
her
head
with
a
great
deal
of
seriousness
it
always
begins
with
laughing
said
the
experienced
woman
but
if
it
ends
without
tears
it
will
be
something
new
to
me
it
about
mr
wentworth
lucy
you
always
together
day
after
day
and
my
dear
such
things
ca
go
on
without
coming
to
something
what
is
to
come
of
it
i
have
looked
at
it
from
every
point
of
view
and
i
am
sure
i
do
know
lucy
flushed
intensely
red
of
course
at
the
curate
name
perhaps
she
had
not
expected
it
just
at
that
moment
but
she
kept
her
composure
like
a
sensible
girl
as
she
was
i
thought
it
was
the
other
side
that
were
questioned
about
their
intentions
she
said
am
i
doing
anything
amiss
mr
wentworth
is
the
curate
of
st
roque
and
i
am
one
of
the
and
we
ca
help
seeing
a
great
deal
of
each
other
so
long
as
this
work
goes
on
at
wharfside
you
would
like
to
stop
a
great
work
because
we
are
obliged
to
see
a
good
deal
of
of
one
particular
person
said
lucy
with
youthful
virtue
looking
at
her
sister
face
at
which
tone
and
look
miss
wodehouse
immediately
faltered
as
the
culprit
knew
she
must
no
oh
no
no
to
be
sure
not
said
the
disturbed
monitor
when
you
say
that
i
do
know
how
to
answer
you
it
must
be
right
i
suppose
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
wonderful
to
see
such
young
creatures
as
you
and
how
you
can
tell
the
right
way
to
set
about
it
but
things
did
not
use
to
be
so
in
my
young
days
girls
dare
not
have
done
such
things
twenty
years
ago
not
in
carlingford
lucy
said
miss
wodehouse
and
dear
i
think
you
ought
to
be
a
little
careful
for
poor
mr
wentworth
sake
i
do
think
mr
wentworth
is
in
any
particular
danger
said
lucy
putting
down
her
cup
with
a
slight
curve
at
the
corners
of
her
pretty
mouth
and
it
is
quite
time
for
you
to
begin
dressing
you
know
you
do
like
to
be
hurried
dear
with
which
speech
the
young
housekeeper
got
up
from
her
gave
her
sister
a
kiss
as
she
passed
and
went
away
singing
softly
to
her
toilette
perhaps
there
was
a
little
flutter
in
lucy
heart
as
she
bound
it
round
with
her
favourite
blue
ribbons
perhaps
it
was
this
that
gave
a
certain
startled
gleam
to
her
blue
eyes
and
made
even
her
father
remark
them
when
she
went
it
seems
to
me
as
if
this
child
were
growing
rather
pretty
molly
eh
i
do
know
what
other
people
think
said
mr
wodehouse
and
perhaps
mr
wentworth
who
was
just
being
ushered
into
the
at
the
moment
heard
the
speech
for
he
too
looked
as
if
he
had
never
found
it
out
before
luckily
there
was
a
party
and
no
opportunity
for
sentiment
the
party
was
in
honour
of
the
rector
and
his
wife
and
mr
wentworth
could
not
but
be
conscious
before
the
evening
was
over
that
he
had
done
something
to
lose
the
favour
of
his
clerical
brother
there
was
a
good
deal
of
church
talk
as
was
natural
at
the
churchwarden
table
where
three
clergymen
were
dining
for
mr
morgan
curate
was
there
as
well
and
the
curate
of
st
roque
who
was
slightly
could
not
help
feeling
himself
disapproved
of
it
was
not
on
the
whole
a
satisfactory
evening
mr
morgan
talked
rather
big
when
the
ladies
went
away
of
his
plans
for
the
reformation
of
carlingford
he
went
into
statistics
about
the
poor
and
the
number
of
people
who
attended
no
church
without
taking
any
notice
of
that
great
work
which
mr
wentworth
knew
to
be
going
on
at
wharfside
the
rector
even
talked
of
wharfside
and
of
the
necessity
of
exertion
on
behalf
of
that
wretched
district
with
a
studious
unconsciousness
of
mr
wentworth
and
all
but
declined
to
receive
better
information
when
mr
wodehouse
proffered
it
matters
were
scarcely
better
in
the
where
lucy
was
entertaining
everybody
and
had
no
leisure
for
the
perpetual
curate
he
took
his
hat
with
a
gloomy
sentiment
of
satisfaction
when
it
was
time
to
go
away
but
when
the
green
door
was
closed
behind
him
mr
wentworth
with
his
first
step
into
the
dewy
darkness
plunged
headlong
into
a
sea
of
thought
he
had
to
walk
down
the
whole
length
of
grange
lane
to
his
lodging
which
was
in
the
last
house
of
the
row
a
small
house
in
a
small
garden
where
mrs
hadwin
the
widow
of
a
whilom
curate
was
permitted
by
public
opinion
on
the
score
of
her
own
unexceptionable
propriety
a
to
receive
a
lodger
without
loss
of
position
thereby
it
was
moonlight
or
rather
it
ought
to
have
been
moonlight
and
no
lamps
were
lighted
in
grange
lane
according
to
the
economical
regulations
of
carlingford
and
as
mr
wentworth
pursued
his
way
down
the
dark
line
of
in
the
face
of
a
sudden
april
shower
which
happened
to
be
falling
he
had
full
scope
and
opportunity
for
his
thoughts
these
thoughts
were
not
the
most
agreeable
in
the
world
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
remembered
that
for
nearly
a
year
past
mr
wentworth
had
had
things
his
own
way
in
carlingford
he
had
been
more
than
rector
he
had
been
archdeacon
or
rather
bishop
in
mr
proctor
time
for
that
good
man
was
humble
and
thankful
for
the
advice
and
assistance
of
his
young
brother
who
knew
so
much
better
than
he
did
now
to
be
looked
upon
as
an
unauthorised
workman
a
kind
of
meddling
dissenterish
missionising
individual
was
rather
hard
upon
the
young
man
and
then
he
thought
of
his
aunts
the
connection
imperceptible
to
an
ignorant
observer
which
existed
between
the
miss
wentworths
and
mr
morgan
and
lucy
and
many
other
matters
interesting
to
their
nephew
was
a
sufficiently
real
connection
when
you
came
to
know
it
that
parish
of
his
own
which
miss
wodehouse
had
wished
him
which
would
free
the
young
clergyman
from
all
trammels
so
far
as
his
work
was
concerned
and
would
enable
him
to
marry
and
do
everything
for
him
it
was
in
the
power
of
the
miss
wentworths
to
bestow
but
they
were
evangelical
women
very
and
thinking
nothing
of
their
nephew
in
comparison
with
their
duty
and
he
was
at
that
time
of
life
and
of
that
disposition
which
for
fear
of
being
supposed
to
wish
to
deceive
them
would
rather
exaggerate
and
make
a
display
of
the
difference
of
his
own
views
not
for
freedom
not
for
lucy
would
the
perpetual
curate
temporise
and
manage
the
matter
so
the
fact
was
that
he
stood
at
the
present
moment
in
a
very
perilous
predicament
but
for
this
family
living
which
was
with
their
mother
property
in
the
hands
of
her
the
three
miss
wentworths
young
frank
wentworth
had
not
a
chance
of
preferment
in
the
world
for
the
respectable
squire
his
father
had
indulged
in
three
wives
and
three
families
and
such
a
regiment
of
sons
that
all
his
influence
had
been
fully
taxed
to
provide
for
them
gerald
the
clergyman
of
the
first
lot
held
the
family
living
not
a
very
large
one
which
belonged
to
the
wentworths
and
frank
who
was
of
the
second
had
been
educated
expressly
with
an
eye
to
skelmersdale
which
belonged
to
his
aunts
how
he
came
at
the
end
to
differ
so
completely
from
these
excellent
ladies
in
his
religious
views
is
not
our
business
just
at
present
but
in
the
mean
time
matters
were
in
a
very
critical
position
the
old
incumbent
of
skelmersdale
was
eighty
and
had
been
ill
all
winter
and
if
the
miss
wentworths
were
not
satisfied
somehow
it
was
all
over
with
their
nephew
hopes
such
were
the
thoughts
that
occupied
his
mind
as
he
walked
down
grange
lane
in
the
dark
past
the
tedious
unsympathetic
line
of
with
the
rain
in
his
face
the
evening
entertainment
had
stirred
up
a
great
many
dormant
sentiments
his
influence
in
carlingford
had
been
ignored
by
this
who
evidently
thought
he
could
do
what
he
liked
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
curate
of
st
roque
and
what
was
a
great
deal
worse
he
had
found
lucy
unapproachable
and
had
realised
if
not
for
the
first
time
still
with
more
distinctness
than
ever
before
that
she
did
not
belong
to
him
and
that
he
had
no
more
right
than
any
other
acquaintance
to
monopolise
her
society
this
last
discovery
was
bitter
to
the
young
man
it
was
this
that
made
him
set
his
face
to
the
rain
and
his
teeth
as
if
that
could
do
any
good
he
had
been
happy
in
her
mere
society
without
entering
into
any
of
the
terrible
preliminaries
of
a
closer
connection
but
now
that
was
over
she
did
not
belong
to
him
and
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
and
how
was
she
ever
to
belong
to
him
not
certainly
if
he
was
to
be
a
perpetual
curate
of
st
roque
or
anywhere
else
he
felt
in
the
misery
of
the
moment
as
if
he
could
never
go
to
that
green
door
again
or
walk
by
her
sweet
side
to
that
service
in
which
they
had
joined
so
lately
he
wondered
whether
she
cared
with
a
despairing
pang
of
anxiety
through
which
for
an
instant
a
celestial
gleam
of
consciousness
leaped
making
the
darkness
all
the
greater
afterwards
and
to
think
that
three
old
ladies
of
whom
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
things
that
the
young
man
could
be
profoundly
reverent
should
hold
in
their
hands
the
absolute
power
of
his
life
and
could
determine
whether
it
was
to
be
sweet
with
hope
and
love
or
stern
constrained
and
impoverished
without
lucy
or
any
other
immediate
light
what
a
strange
anomaly
this
was
which
met
him
full
in
the
face
as
he
pursued
his
thoughts
if
it
had
been
his
bishop
or
his
college
or
any
fitting
tribunal
but
his
aunts
mr
ring
at
his
own
door
was
so
much
more
hasty
than
usual
that
mrs
hadwin
paused
in
the
hall
when
she
had
lighted
her
candle
to
see
if
anything
was
the
matter
the
little
neat
old
lady
held
up
her
candle
to
look
at
him
as
he
came
in
glistening
all
over
with
i
hope
you
are
not
wet
mr
wentworth
she
said
it
is
only
an
april
shower
and
we
want
it
so
much
in
the
gardens
and
i
hope
you
have
had
a
nice
party
and
a
pleasant
evening
thank
you
pretty
well
said
the
perpetual
curate
with
less
suavity
than
usual
and
a
sigh
that
nearly
blew
mrs
hadwin
candle
out
she
saw
he
was
discomposed
and
therefore
with
a
feminine
instinct
found
more
to
say
than
usual
before
she
made
her
peaceful
way
to
bed
she
waited
while
mr
wentworth
lighted
his
candle
too
mr
parties
are
always
pleasant
she
said
i
never
go
out
you
know
but
i
like
to
hear
of
people
enjoying
themselves
i
insist
upon
you
going
before
me
mr
wentworth
i
have
so
little
breath
to
spare
and
i
take
such
a
long
time
going
up
that
you
would
be
tired
to
death
waiting
for
me
now
do
be
polite
i
insist
upon
you
going
up
first
thank
you
now
i
can
take
my
time
and
she
took
her
time
accordingly
keeping
mr
wentworth
waiting
on
the
landing
to
say
to
her
much
to
his
silent
exasperation
when
he
got
into
the
shelter
of
his
own
he
threw
himself
upon
a
sofa
and
continued
his
thoughts
with
many
a
troubled
addition
a
young
man
feeling
in
a
great
measure
the
world
before
him
conscious
of
considerable
powers
standing
on
the
very
threshold
of
so
much
possible
good
and
happiness
it
was
hideous
to
look
up
in
his
excited
imagination
and
see
the
figures
of
these
three
old
ladies
worse
than
fates
standing
across
the
prospect
and
barring
the
way
and
lucy
meantime
was
undoing
her
blue
ribbons
with
a
thrill
of
sweet
agitation
in
her
untroubled
bosom
perhaps
mary
was
right
and
it
was
about
coming
to
the
time
when
this
revelation
could
not
be
postponed
much
longer
for
it
will
be
perceived
that
lucy
was
not
in
much
doubt
of
young
wentworth
sentiments
and
then
she
paused
in
the
dark
after
she
had
said
her
prayers
to
give
one
timid
thought
to
the
sweet
life
that
seemed
to
lie
before
her
so
close
at
hand
in
which
perhaps
he
and
she
were
to
go
out
together
she
did
not
know
where
for
the
help
of
the
world
and
the
comfort
of
the
sorrowful
and
not
trusting
herself
to
look
much
at
that
ideal
said
another
prayer
and
went
to
sleep
like
one
of
god
beloved
with
a
tear
too
exquisite
to
be
shed
brimming
under
her
long
eyelashes
at
this
crisis
of
existence
perhaps
for
once
in
her
life
the
woman
has
the
best
of
it
for
very
different
from
lucy
were
the
thoughts
with
which
the
curate
sought
his
restless
pillow
hearing
the
rain
drip
all
the
night
and
trickle
into
mrs
hadwin
reservoirs
the
old
lady
had
a
passion
for
and
it
was
a
gusty
night
chapter
iii
next
week
was
passion
week
and
full
of
occupation
even
if
it
had
been
consistent
either
with
mr
wentworth
principles
or
lucy
to
introduce
secular
affairs
into
so
holy
a
season
they
had
not
time
or
opportunity
as
it
happened
which
was
perhaps
just
as
well
for
otherwise
the
premonitory
thrill
of
expectation
which
had
disturbed
lucy
calm
and
the
bitter
exasperation
against
himself
and
his
fate
with
which
mr
wentworth
had
discovered
that
he
dared
not
say
anything
might
have
caused
an
estrangement
between
them
as
it
was
the
air
was
thundery
and
ominous
through
all
the
solemn
days
of
the
holy
week
a
consciousness
as
of
something
about
to
happen
overshadowed
even
the
district
and
attracted
the
keen
observation
of
the
lively
spectators
at
wharfside
they
were
not
greatly
up
in
matters
of
doctrine
nor
perhaps
did
they
quite
understand
the
eloquent
little
sermon
which
the
perpetual
curate
gave
them
on
good
friday
in
the
afternoon
between
his
own
services
by
way
of
impressing
upon
their
minds
the
awful
memories
of
the
day
but
they
were
as
skilful
in
the
variations
of
their
young
looks
and
as
well
qualified
to
decide
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
a
something
between
him
and
miss
lucy
wodehouse
as
any
practised
observer
in
the
higher
ranks
of
society
whether
the
two
had
an
unpleasantness
as
wharfside
was
well
aware
human
creatures
under
such
circumstances
are
liable
to
have
the
interested
community
could
not
quite
make
out
but
that
something
more
than
ordinary
was
going
on
and
that
the
prettiest
of
all
the
provident
ladies
had
a
certain
preoccupation
in
her
blue
eyes
was
a
fact
perfectly
apparent
to
that
intelligent
society
and
indeed
one
of
the
kinder
matrons
in
prickett
lane
had
even
ventured
so
far
as
to
wish
miss
lucy
a
weddin
when
the
time
comes
and
there
to
be
a
sight
o
weddings
this
easter
had
added
another
who
was
somewhat
scandalised
by
the
flowers
in
the
bonnet
of
one
of
the
and
proceeded
to
say
so
in
some
detail
but
miss
lucy
wo
wear
no
bonnet
the
quality
goes
in
veils
and
there
never
was
as
full
a
church
as
there
will
be
to
see
it
wishing
you
your
and
as
aint
no
more
nor
you
deserve
and
you
so
good
to
us
poor
folks
all
which
felicitations
and
inquiries
had
confused
lucy
though
she
made
her
way
out
of
them
with
a
which
amazed
her
sister
you
see
what
everybody
thinks
dear
said
that
gentle
woman
when
they
had
made
their
escape
oh
mary
how
can
you
talk
of
such
things
at
such
a
time
the
young
sister
of
mercy
had
answered
once
more
turning
those
severe
eyes
of
youthful
devotion
upon
her
troubled
elder
sister
who
to
tell
the
truth
not
having
been
brought
up
to
it
as
she
said
felt
much
the
same
on
easter
eve
as
at
other
times
of
her
life
and
thus
once
more
the
matter
concluded
as
for
mr
wentworth
he
was
much
occupied
on
that
last
day
of
the
holy
week
with
a
great
many
important
matters
on
hand
he
had
not
seen
the
wodehouses
since
the
good
friday
evening
service
which
was
an
interval
of
about
twenty
hours
and
had
just
paused
before
eating
his
bachelor
dinner
to
ponder
whether
it
would
be
correct
on
that
most
sacred
of
vigils
to
steal
away
for
half
an
hour
just
to
ask
lucy
if
she
thought
it
necessary
that
he
should
see
the
sick
woman
at
no
prickett
lane
before
the
morning
it
was
while
he
was
pondering
this
matter
in
his
mind
that
mr
wentworth
heart
jumped
to
his
throat
upon
receipt
quite
suddenly
without
preparation
of
the
following
note
my
dearest
boy
your
aunts
cecilia
leonora
and
i
have
just
arrived
at
this
excellent
inn
the
blue
boar
old
mr
shirley
at
skelmersdale
is
in
a
very
bad
way
poor
man
and
i
thought
the
thing
i
could
do
in
my
dearest
frank
interests
was
to
persuade
them
to
make
you
an
and
see
everything
for
themselves
i
am
in
a
terrible
fright
now
lest
i
should
have
done
wrong
but
my
dear
dear
boy
knows
it
is
always
his
interest
that
i
have
at
heart
and
leonora
is
so
intent
on
having
a
gospel
at
skelmersdale
that
she
would
have
been
content
with
anything
less
than
hearing
you
with
her
own
ears
i
hope
and
trust
in
providence
that
you
do
intone
like
poor
gerald
and
oh
frank
my
dear
boy
come
directly
and
dine
with
us
and
do
fly
in
your
aunt
leonora
face
and
tell
me
i
have
been
imprudent
i
thought
it
would
be
best
to
take
you
unawares
when
you
had
everything
prepared
and
when
we
should
see
you
just
as
you
always
are
for
i
am
convinced
leonora
and
you
only
want
to
see
more
of
each
other
to
understand
each
other
perfectly
come
my
dearest
boy
and
give
a
little
comfort
to
your
loving
and
anxious
aunt
dora
mr
wentworth
sat
gazing
blankly
upon
this
horrible
missive
for
some
minutes
after
he
had
read
it
quite
unaware
of
the
humble
presence
of
the
maid
who
stood
asking
please
was
she
to
bring
up
dinner
when
he
came
to
himself
the
awful
no
with
which
he
answered
that
alarmed
handmaiden
almost
drove
her
into
hysterics
as
she
escaped
however
mr
wentworth
immediately
put
his
head
out
at
the
door
and
called
after
her
i
ca
wait
for
dinner
sarah
i
am
suddenly
called
out
and
shall
dine
where
i
am
going
tell
cook
said
the
young
parson
suddenly
recollecting
lucy
client
to
send
what
she
has
prepared
for
me
if
it
is
very
nice
to
no
prickett
lane
my
boy
will
take
it
and
send
him
off
directly
please
with
which
last
commission
the
young
man
went
up
despairingly
to
his
bedroom
to
prepare
himself
for
this
interview
with
his
aunts
what
was
he
to
do
already
before
him
in
dreadful
prophetic
vision
he
saw
all
three
seated
in
one
of
the
handsome
open
benches
in
st
roque
looking
indescribable
horrors
at
the
crown
of
spring
lilies
which
lucy
own
fingers
were
to
weave
for
the
cross
above
the
altar
and
listening
to
the
cadence
of
his
own
manly
tenor
as
it
rang
through
the
perfect
little
church
of
which
he
was
so
proud
yes
there
was
an
end
of
skelmersdale
without
any
doubt
or
question
now
whatever
hope
there
might
have
been
aunt
dora
had
settled
the
matter
by
this
last
move
of
hers
an
end
to
skelmersdale
and
an
end
of
lucy
perhaps
he
had
better
try
not
to
see
her
any
more
and
the
poor
young
priest
saw
that
his
own
face
looked
ghastly
as
he
looked
at
it
in
the
glass
it
gave
him
a
little
comfort
to
meet
the
boy
with
a
bundle
pinned
up
in
snowy
napkins
from
which
a
grateful
odour
ascended
bending
his
steps
to
prickett
lane
as
he
himself
went
out
to
meet
his
fate
it
was
a
last
offering
to
that
beloved
district
with
which
the
image
of
his
love
was
blended
but
he
would
have
given
his
dinner
to
lucy
sick
woman
any
day
it
was
a
greater
sacrifice
that
was
to
be
required
of
him
he
went
mournfully
and
slowly
up
grange
lane
steeling
himself
for
the
encounter
and
trying
to
forgive
aunt
dora
in
his
heart
it
was
not
very
easy
things
might
have
turned
out
just
the
same
without
any
interference
that
was
true
but
to
have
it
all
brought
on
in
this
wanton
manner
by
a
kind
foolish
woman
who
would
wring
her
hands
and
gaze
in
your
face
and
want
to
know
oh
did
you
think
it
was
her
fault
after
she
had
precipitated
the
calamity
was
very
hard
and
it
was
with
a
very
gloomy
countenance
accordingly
that
the
curate
of
st
roque
presented
himself
at
the
blue
boar
the
miss
wentworths
were
in
the
very
best
which
the
blue
boar
contained
the
style
in
which
they
travelled
with
a
man
and
two
maids
was
enough
to
secure
that
and
the
kitchen
of
that
respectable
establishment
was
doing
its
very
best
to
send
up
a
dinner
worthy
of
a
party
as
had
their
own
man
to
wait
the
three
ladies
greeted
their
nephew
with
varying
degrees
of
enthusiasm
the
eldest
miss
wentworth
from
whom
he
took
his
second
name
cecil
did
not
rise
from
her
chair
but
nevertheless
kissed
him
in
an
affectionate
dignified
way
when
he
was
brought
to
her
as
for
aunt
dora
she
ran
into
her
dear
arms
and
in
the
very
moment
of
that
embrace
whispered
in
his
ear
the
expression
of
her
anxiety
and
the
panic
which
always
followed
those
rash
steps
which
she
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
oh
my
dear
i
hope
you
do
think
i
to
blame
she
said
with
her
lips
at
his
ear
and
gained
but
cold
comfort
from
the
curate
face
the
alarming
member
of
the
party
was
miss
leonora
she
rose
and
made
two
steps
forward
to
meet
the
unfortunate
young
man
she
shook
both
his
hands
cordially
and
said
she
was
very
glad
to
see
him
and
hoped
he
was
well
she
was
the
sensible
sister
of
the
three
and
no
doubt
required
all
the
sense
she
had
to
manage
her
companions
miss
wentworth
who
had
been
very
pretty
in
her
youth
was
now
a
beautiful
old
lady
with
hair
and
the
most
charming
smile
and
miss
dora
who
was
only
fifty
retained
the
natural
colour
of
her
own
scanty
locks
which
wavered
in
ringlets
over
her
cheeks
but
miss
leonora
was
without
any
complexion
in
particular
and
altogether
a
harder
type
of
woman
it
was
she
who
held
in
her
hands
the
fate
of
skelmersdale
and
of
frank
wentworth
her
terrible
glance
it
was
which
he
had
imagined
gleaming
fierce
upon
his
lilies
lucy
lilies
his
easter
decorations
it
was
by
her
side
the
alarmed
curate
was
made
to
sit
down
it
was
she
who
took
the
foot
of
the
table
and
was
the
gentleman
of
the
house
her
voice
was
of
that
class
of
voice
which
may
be
politely
called
a
powerful
contralto
every
way
she
was
as
alarming
a
critic
as
ever
was
encountered
by
a
perpetual
curate
or
any
other
young
man
in
trouble
mr
wentworth
said
feebly
that
this
was
a
very
unexpected
pleasure
as
he
met
his
aunt
leonora
eye
i
hope
it
a
pleasure
said
that
penetrating
observer
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
not
expect
it
would
be
but
your
aunt
dora
thought
so
and
you
know
when
she
sets
her
heart
on
anything
nobody
can
get
any
peace
not
that
your
aunt
cecilia
and
i
would
have
come
on
that
account
if
we
had
not
wished
for
many
reasons
to
have
some
conversation
with
you
and
see
how
you
are
getting
on
quite
so
leonora
said
miss
wentworth
smiling
upon
her
nephew
and
leaning
back
in
her
chair
then
there
was
a
little
pause
for
after
such
a
terrible
address
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
poor
man
who
understood
every
word
of
it
could
repeat
his
commonplace
about
the
pleasure
miss
dora
of
course
seized
the
opportunity
to
rush
in
we
have
been
hearing
such
delightful
things
about
you
my
dear
from
the
people
of
the
house
leonora
is
so
pleased
to
hear
how
you
are
labouring
among
the
people
and
doing
your
master
work
we
take
all
the
happiness
to
ourselves
because
you
know
you
are
boy
frank
said
the
anxious
aunt
all
her
thin
ringlets
poor
lady
trembling
with
her
eagerness
to
make
everything
comfortable
for
her
favourite
and
we
have
come
you
know
specially
to
hear
you
on
easter
sunday
in
your
own
church
i
am
looking
forward
to
a
great
treat
to
think
i
should
never
have
heard
you
though
it
is
so
long
since
you
were
ordained
none
of
us
have
ever
heard
you
not
even
leonora
but
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
us
all
to
know
you
are
so
much
liked
in
carlingford
cried
the
troubled
woman
growing
nervous
at
sight
of
the
unresponsive
quiet
around
her
miss
leonora
by
no
means
replied
to
the
covert
appeals
thus
made
to
her
she
left
her
nephew
and
her
sister
to
keep
up
the
conversation
unassisted
and
as
for
miss
wentworth
conversation
was
not
her
forte
i
afraid
aunt
you
will
not
anything
worth
such
a
long
journey
said
mr
wentworth
moved
like
a
rash
young
man
as
he
was
to
display
his
colours
at
once
and
cry
no
surrender
i
do
think
an
easter
sunday
is
a
time
for
much
preaching
and
the
church
has
made
such
ample
provision
for
the
expression
of
our
sentiments
i
am
more
of
a
humble
priest
than
an
ambitious
preacher
said
the
young
man
with
characteristic
youthful
pretence
of
the
most
transparent
kind
he
looked
in
miss
leonora
face
as
he
spoke
he
knew
the
very
name
of
priest
was
an
offence
in
its
way
to
that
highly
evangelical
woman
and
if
they
were
to
come
to
single
combat
better
immediately
than
after
intolerable
suspense
and
delay
perhaps
dora
you
will
postpone
your
raptures
about
sermon
which
may
be
a
very
indifferent
sermon
as
he
says
for
anything
we
can
tell
till
after
dinner
said
miss
leonora
we
all
very
glad
to
see
him
and
he
need
not
think
any
little
speeches
he
may
make
will
disturb
me
i
daresay
the
poor
boy
would
be
glad
to
hear
of
some
of
the
people
belonging
to
him
instead
of
all
that
nonsense
come
to
dinner
frank
take
the
other
side
of
the
table
opposite
dora
and
now
that
you
said
grace
i
give
you
full
leave
to
forget
that
you
a
clergyman
for
an
hour
at
least
we
were
down
at
the
old
hall
a
week
ago
and
saw
your
father
and
the
rest
they
are
all
well
and
the
last
boy
is
rather
like
you
if
you
will
think
that
any
compliment
mrs
wentworth
is
pleased
because
you
are
one
of
the
handsome
ones
you
know
not
much
fear
of
the
wentworths
dying
out
of
the
country
yet
awhile
your
father
is
getting
at
his
wit
end
and
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
cuthbert
and
guy
three
sons
are
enough
in
the
army
and
two
at
sea
and
i
rather
think
it
as
much
as
we
can
stand
continued
miss
leonora
not
without
a
gleam
of
humour
in
her
eyes
to
have
two
in
the
church
that
is
as
it
may
happen
said
the
perpetual
curate
with
a
little
spirit
if
the
boys
are
of
my
way
of
thinking
they
will
consider
the
church
the
highest
of
professions
but
guy
and
cuthbert
must
go
to
australia
i
suppose
like
most
other
people
and
take
their
chance
no
harm
in
that
not
a
bit
of
harm
said
the
rich
aunt
they
good
boys
enough
and
i
daresay
they
get
on
as
for
gerald
if
you
have
any
influence
with
your
brother
i
think
he
in
a
bad
way
i
think
he
has
a
bad
attack
of
romishness
coming
on
if
you
are
not
in
that
way
yourself
said
miss
leonora
with
a
sharp
glance
i
think
you
should
go
and
see
after
gerald
he
is
the
sort
of
man
who
would
do
anything
foolish
you
know
he
does
understand
what
prudence
means
remember
i
believe
he
is
a
good
christian
all
the
same
it
very
incomprehensible
but
the
fact
is
a
man
may
be
a
very
good
christian
and
have
the
least
quality
of
sense
that
is
compatible
with
existence
i
seen
it
over
and
over
again
gerald
notions
are
idiocy
to
me
said
the
sensible
but
candid
woman
shrugging
her
shoulders
but
i
ca
deny
that
a
good
man
for
all
that
he
is
the
best
man
i
ever
knew
said
young
wentworth
with
enthusiasm
quite
so
frank
echoed
aunt
cecilia
with
her
sweet
smile
it
was
almost
the
only
conversational
effort
miss
wentworth
ever
made
but
it
is
so
sad
to
see
how
he
led
away
said
miss
dora
it
is
all
owing
to
the
bad
advisers
young
men
meet
with
at
the
universities
and
how
can
it
be
otherwise
as
long
as
tutors
and
professors
are
chosen
just
for
their
learning
without
any
regard
to
their
principles
what
is
greek
and
latin
in
comparison
with
a
pious
guide
for
the
young
we
would
not
have
to
feel
frightened
as
we
do
so
often
about
young
men
principles
continued
aunt
dora
fixing
her
eyes
with
warning
significance
on
her
nephew
and
trying
hard
to
open
telegraphic
communications
with
him
if
more
attention
was
paid
at
the
universities
to
give
them
sound
guidance
in
their
studies
so
long
as
you
are
sound
in
your
principles
there
is
no
fear
of
you
said
the
timid
diplomatist
trying
to
aid
the
warning
look
of
her
eyes
by
emphasis
and
inflection
poor
miss
dora
it
was
her
unlucky
fate
by
dint
of
her
very
exertions
in
smoothing
matters
always
to
make
things
worse
he
would
be
a
bold
man
who
would
call
those
principles
unsound
which
have
made
my
brother
gerald
what
he
is
said
with
an
affectionate
admiration
that
became
him
the
curate
of
st
roque
it
a
slavish
system
notwithstanding
gerald
said
miss
leonora
with
some
heat
and
a
false
system
and
leads
to
antichrist
at
the
end
and
nothing
less
eat
your
dinner
frank
we
are
not
going
to
argue
just
now
we
expected
to
hear
that
another
of
the
girls
was
engaged
before
we
came
away
but
it
has
not
occurred
yet
i
approve
of
young
men
dancing
about
a
house
for
ever
and
ever
unless
they
mean
something
do
you
mr
wentworth
faltered
at
this
question
it
disturbed
his
composure
more
than
anything
that
had
preceded
it
i
really
i
do
know
he
said
after
a
pause
with
a
sickly
smile
of
which
all
three
of
his
aunts
took
private
notes
forming
their
own
conclusions
it
was
as
may
well
be
supposed
a
very
severe
ordeal
which
the
poor
young
man
had
to
go
through
when
he
was
permitted
to
say
he
went
away
with
a
sensation
of
fatigue
more
overpowering
than
if
he
had
visited
all
the
houses
in
wharfside
when
he
passed
the
green
door
over
which
the
rustled
in
the
dark
it
was
a
pang
to
his
heart
how
was
he
to
continue
to
live
to
come
and
go
through
that
familiar
road
to
go
through
all
the
meetings
and
partings
when
this
last
hopeless
trial
was
over
and
lucy
and
he
were
swept
apart
as
if
by
an
earthquake
if
his
lips
were
sealed
henceforward
and
he
never
was
at
liberty
to
say
what
was
in
his
heart
what
would
she
think
of
him
he
could
not
fly
from
his
work
because
he
lost
skelmersdale
and
how
was
he
to
bear
it
he
went
home
with
a
dull
bitterness
in
his
mind
trying
when
he
thought
of
it
to
quiet
the
aching
pulses
which
throbbed
all
over
him
with
what
ought
to
have
been
the
hallowed
associations
of
the
last
lenten
vigil
but
it
was
difficult
throbbing
as
he
was
with
wild
life
and
trouble
to
the
very
to
get
himself
into
the
shadow
of
that
grave
by
which
according
to
his
own
theory
the
church
should
be
watching
on
this
easter
eve
it
was
hard
just
then
to
be
bound
to
that
special
remembrance
what
he
wanted
at
this
moment
was
no
memory
of
one
hour
however
memorable
or
glorious
not
even
though
it
contained
the
redeemer
grave
but
the
sense
of
a
living
friend
standing
by
him
in
the
great
struggle
which
is
the
essential
and
unfailing
comfort
of
a
christian
life
next
morning
he
went
to
church
with
a
youthful
sense
of
martyrdom
of
which
in
his
heart
he
was
half
ashamed
st
roque
was
very
fair
to
see
that
easter
morning
above
the
with
all
its
sacred
vessels
the
carved
oaken
cross
of
the
reredos
was
wreathed
tenderly
with
white
fragrant
festoons
of
spring
lilies
sweet
narcissus
of
the
poets
and
mr
wentworth
choristers
made
another
white
line
two
deep
down
each
side
of
the
chancel
the
young
anglican
took
in
all
the
details
of
the
scene
on
his
way
to
the
as
the
white
procession
ranged
itself
in
the
oaken
stalls
at
that
moment
the
worst
moment
for
such
a
thought
it
suddenly
flashed
over
him
that
after
all
a
wreath
of
spring
flowers
or
a
chorister
surplice
was
scarcely
worth
suffering
martyrdom
for
this
horrible
suggestion
true
essence
of
an
unheroic
age
which
will
not
suffer
a
man
to
be
absolutely
sure
of
anything
disturbed
his
prayer
as
he
knelt
down
in
silence
to
ask
god
blessing
easter
to
be
sure
was
lovely
enough
of
itself
without
the
garland
and
mr
wentworth
knew
well
enough
that
his
singers
were
no
immaculate
it
was
satan
himself
surely
and
no
inferior
imp
who
shot
that
sudden
arrow
into
the
young
man
heart
as
he
tried
to
say
his
private
prayer
for
the
curate
of
st
roque
was
not
only
a
fervent
anglican
but
also
a
young
englishman
with
all
the
sensitive
almost
fantastic
delicacy
of
honour
which
belongs
to
that
development
of
humanity
and
not
for
a
dozen
worlds
would
he
have
sacrificed
a
lily
or
a
surplice
on
this
particular
easter
when
all
his
worldly
hopes
hung
in
the
balance
but
to
think
at
this
crowning
moment
that
a
villanous
doubt
of
the
benefit
of
these
surplices
and
lilies
should
seize
his
troubled
heart
for
just
then
the
strains
of
the
organ
died
away
in
lengthened
whispers
and
miss
leonora
wentworth
severe
and
awful
swept
up
through
the
middle
aisle
it
was
under
these
terrible
circumstances
that
the
perpetual
curate
with
his
heart
throbbing
and
his
head
aching
began
to
intone
the
morning
service
on
that
easter
sunday
ever
after
a
day
so
memorable
in
the
records
of
st
roque
chapter
iv
mr
wentworth
sermon
on
easter
sunday
was
one
which
he
himself
long
remembered
though
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
of
his
congregation
had
memories
as
faithful
to
tell
the
truth
the
young
man
put
a
black
cross
upon
it
with
his
blackest
ink
a
memorial
of
meaning
unknown
to
anybody
but
himself
it
was
a
curious
little
sermon
such
as
may
still
be
heard
in
some
anglican
pulpits
though
he
had
heart
and
mind
enough
to
conceive
something
of
those
natural
depths
of
divine
significance
and
human
interest
which
are
the
very
essence
of
the
easter
festival
it
was
not
into
these
that
mr
wentworth
entered
in
his
sermon
he
spoke
in
very
choice
little
sentences
of
the
beneficence
of
the
church
in
appointing
such
a
feast
and
of
all
the
beautiful
arrangements
she
had
made
for
the
keeping
of
it
but
even
in
the
speaking
in
the
excited
state
of
mind
he
was
in
it
occurred
to
the
young
man
to
see
by
a
sudden
flash
of
illumination
how
much
higher
how
much
more
catholic
after
all
his
teaching
would
have
been
could
he
but
have
once
ignored
the
church
and
gone
direct
as
nature
bade
to
that
empty
grave
in
which
all
the
hopes
of
humanity
had
been
entombed
he
saw
it
by
gleams
of
that
perverse
light
which
seemed
more
satanic
than
heavenly
in
the
moments
it
chose
for
shining
while
he
was
preaching
his
little
sermon
about
the
church
and
her
beautiful
institution
of
easter
just
as
he
had
seen
the
of
his
and
surplices
as
he
was
about
to
suffer
martyrdom
for
them
all
these
circumstances
were
hard
upon
the
young
man
looking
down
straight
into
the
severe
eyes
of
his
aunt
leonora
he
could
not
of
course
so
much
as
modify
a
single
sentence
of
the
discourse
he
was
uttering
no
more
than
he
could
permit
himself
to
slur
over
a
single
monotone
of
the
service
but
that
sudden
bewildering
perception
that
he
could
have
done
so
much
better
that
the
loftiest
of
all
might
have
been
consistent
enough
with
skelmersdale
had
he
but
gone
into
the
heart
of
the
matter
gave
a
bitterness
to
the
deeper
unseen
current
of
the
curate
thoughts
besides
it
was
terrible
to
feel
that
he
could
not
abstract
himself
from
personal
concerns
even
in
the
most
sacred
duties
he
was
conscious
that
the
two
elder
sisters
went
away
and
that
only
poor
aunt
dora
her
ringlets
limp
with
tears
came
tremulous
to
the
altar
rails
when
the
service
was
over
and
the
young
priest
was
disrobing
himself
she
came
to
him
and
gave
a
spasmodic
sympathetic
pressure
to
his
hand
oh
frank
my
dear
i
did
it
for
the
best
said
miss
dora
with
a
doleful
countenance
and
the
perpetual
curate
knew
that
his
doom
was
sealed
he
put
the
best
face
he
could
upon
the
matter
having
sufficient
doubts
of
his
own
wisdom
to
subdue
the
high
temper
of
the
wentworths
for
that
moment
at
least
what
was
it
you
did
for
the
best
said
the
curate
of
st
roque
i
suppose
after
all
it
was
no
such
great
matter
me
as
you
thought
but
i
told
you
i
was
not
an
ambitious
preacher
this
is
a
day
for
worship
not
for
talk
ah
yes
said
miss
dora
but
oh
frank
my
dear
it
is
hard
upon
me
after
all
my
expectations
it
would
have
been
so
nice
to
have
had
you
at
skelmersdale
i
hoped
you
would
marry
julia
trench
and
we
should
all
have
been
so
happy
and
perhaps
if
i
had
not
begged
leonora
to
come
just
now
thinking
it
would
be
so
nice
to
take
you
just
in
your
usual
way
but
she
must
have
known
sooner
or
later
said
poor
aunt
dora
looking
wistfully
in
his
face
oh
frank
i
hope
you
do
think
i
to
blame
i
never
should
have
married
julia
trench
said
the
curate
gloomily
he
did
not
enter
into
the
question
of
miss
dora
guilt
or
innocence
he
gave
a
glance
at
the
lilies
on
the
altar
and
a
sigh
the
chances
were
he
would
never
marry
anybody
but
loyalty
to
lucy
demanded
instant
repudiation
of
any
other
possible
bride
where
are
you
going
aunt
dora
back
to
the
blue
boar
or
will
you
come
with
me
he
said
as
they
stood
together
at
the
door
of
st
roque
mr
wentworth
felt
as
if
he
had
caught
the
beginning
threads
of
a
good
many
different
lines
of
thought
which
he
would
be
glad
to
be
alone
to
work
out
you
come
back
with
me
to
the
inn
to
lunch
said
miss
dora
oh
frank
my
dear
remember
your
christian
feelings
and
do
make
a
breach
in
the
family
it
will
be
bad
enough
to
face
your
poor
dear
father
after
he
knows
what
leonora
means
to
do
and
i
do
so
want
to
talk
to
you
said
the
poor
woman
eagerly
clinging
to
his
arm
you
always
were
fond
of
your
poor
aunt
dora
frank
when
you
were
quite
a
little
trot
you
used
always
to
like
me
best
and
in
the
holiday
times
when
you
came
down
from
harrow
i
used
always
to
hear
all
your
troubles
if
you
would
only
have
confidence
in
me
now
but
what
if
i
have
no
troubles
to
confide
said
mr
wentworth
a
man
and
a
boy
are
very
different
things
come
aunt
dora
i
see
you
safe
to
your
inn
what
should
i
have
to
grumble
about
i
have
plenty
to
do
and
it
is
easter
and
few
men
can
have
everything
their
own
way
you
wo
acknowledge
that
you
vexed
said
aunt
dora
almost
crying
under
her
veil
but
i
can
see
it
all
the
same
you
always
were
such
a
true
wentworth
but
if
you
only
would
give
in
and
say
that
you
are
disappointed
and
angry
with
us
all
i
could
bear
it
better
frank
i
would
not
feel
then
that
you
thought
it
my
fault
and
oh
frank
dear
you
do
consider
how
disappointed
your
poor
dear
aunt
leonora
was
it
just
as
hard
upon
us
she
continued
pressing
his
arm
in
her
eagerness
as
it
is
upon
you
we
had
all
so
set
our
hearts
on
having
you
at
skelmersdale
do
you
think
if
you
were
giving
your
mind
to
it
you
might
see
things
in
a
different
light
with
another
pressure
of
his
arm
oh
frank
what
does
it
matter
after
all
if
the
heart
is
right
whether
you
read
the
service
in
your
natural
voice
or
give
that
little
quaver
at
the
end
i
am
sure
for
my
part
my
dear
aunt
said
mr
wentworth
naturally
incensed
by
this
manner
of
description
i
must
be
allowed
to
say
that
my
convictions
are
fixed
and
not
likely
to
be
altered
i
am
a
priest
and
you
are
a
woman
he
stopped
short
with
perhaps
a
little
bitterness
it
was
very
true
she
was
a
woman
unqualified
to
teach
but
yet
she
and
her
sisters
were
absolute
in
skelmersdale
he
made
a
little
gulp
of
his
momentary
irritation
and
walked
on
in
silence
with
miss
dora
kind
wistful
hand
clinging
to
his
arm
but
dear
frank
among
us
protestants
you
know
there
is
no
sacerdotal
caste
said
miss
dora
opportunely
recollecting
some
scrap
of
an
exeter
hall
speech
we
are
all
kings
and
priests
to
god
oh
frank
it
is
gerald
example
that
has
led
you
away
i
am
sure
before
you
went
to
oxford
you
were
never
at
all
a
ritualist
even
leonora
thought
you
such
a
pious
boy
and
i
am
sure
your
good
sense
must
teach
you
faltered
aunt
dora
trying
her
sister
grand
tone
hush
hush
i
ca
have
you
begin
to
argue
with
me
you
are
not
my
aunt
leonora
said
the
curate
half
amused
in
spite
of
himself
this
encouraged
the
anxious
woman
and
clasping
his
arm
closer
than
ever
she
poured
out
all
her
heart
oh
frank
if
you
could
only
modify
your
views
a
little
it
is
not
that
there
is
any
difference
between
your
views
and
ours
except
just
in
words
my
dear
flowers
are
very
pretty
decorations
and
i
know
you
look
very
nice
in
your
surplice
and
i
am
sure
for
my
part
i
should
not
mind
but
then
that
is
not
carrying
the
word
of
god
to
the
people
as
leonora
says
if
the
heart
is
right
what
does
it
matter
about
the
altar
said
aunt
dora
unconsciously
falling
upon
the
very
argument
that
had
occurred
to
her
nephew
perplexed
mind
in
the
pulpit
even
though
i
was
in
such
trouble
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
happiness
it
was
to
take
the
sacrament
from
your
hands
my
dear
dear
boy
and
but
for
these
flowers
and
things
that
could
do
nobody
any
good
poor
dear
leonora
who
is
very
fond
of
you
though
perhaps
you
do
think
it
could
have
had
that
happiness
too
oh
frank
do
you
think
you
could
give
up
these
things
that
do
matter
if
you
were
just
to
tell
leonora
you
have
been
thinking
it
over
and
that
you
see
you
made
a
mistake
and
that
in
future
you
do
mean
to
insult
me
said
the
young
man
hush
hush
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
not
to
be
made
archbishop
of
canterbury
instead
of
vicar
of
skelmersdale
i
do
understand
how
you
could
suggest
such
a
thing
to
me
miss
dora
veil
which
she
had
partly
lifted
here
fell
over
her
face
as
it
had
kept
doing
all
the
time
she
was
speaking
but
this
time
she
did
not
put
it
back
she
was
no
longer
able
to
contain
herself
but
wept
hot
tears
of
distress
and
vexation
under
the
flimsy
covering
of
lace
no
of
course
you
will
not
do
it
you
will
far
rather
be
haughty
and
say
it
is
my
fault
said
poor
miss
dora
we
have
all
so
much
pride
we
wentworths
and
you
never
think
of
our
disappointment
and
how
we
all
calculated
upon
having
you
at
skelmersdale
and
how
happy
we
were
to
be
and
that
you
were
to
marry
julia
trench
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
the
two
reached
the
corner
of
prickett
lane
lucy
wodehouse
had
been
down
there
seeing
the
sick
woman
she
had
indeed
been
carrying
her
dinner
to
that
poor
creature
and
was
just
turning
into
grange
lane
with
her
blue
ribbons
hidden
under
the
grey
cloak
and
a
little
basket
in
her
hand
they
met
full
in
the
face
at
this
corner
and
miss
dora
words
reached
ears
and
went
through
and
through
her
with
a
little
nervous
thrill
she
had
not
time
to
think
whether
it
was
pain
or
only
surprise
that
moved
her
and
was
not
even
enough
to
observe
the
tremulous
pressure
of
the
curate
hand
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
introduced
his
aunt
i
have
just
been
to
see
the
poor
woman
at
no
said
lucy
she
is
very
ill
if
you
had
time
it
would
be
kind
of
you
to
see
her
i
think
she
has
something
on
her
mind
i
will
go
there
before
i
go
to
wharfside
said
mr
wentworth
are
you
coming
down
to
the
service
this
afternoon
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
a
long
service
for
there
are
all
these
little
burrowses
you
know
yes
i
am
godmother
said
lucy
and
smiled
and
gave
him
her
hand
again
as
she
passed
him
while
aunt
dora
looked
on
with
curious
eyes
the
poor
curate
heaved
a
mighty
sigh
as
he
looked
after
the
grey
cloak
not
his
the
privilege
now
to
walk
with
her
to
the
green
door
to
take
her
basket
from
the
soft
hand
of
the
merciful
sister
on
the
contrary
he
had
to
turn
his
back
upon
lucy
and
walk
on
with
aunt
dora
to
the
inn
at
this
moment
a
symbolical
action
which
seemed
to
embody
his
fate
where
is
wharfside
and
who
are
the
little
burrowses
and
what
does
the
young
lady
mean
by
being
godmother
said
aunt
dora
she
looks
very
sweet
and
nice
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
grey
cloak
oh
frank
i
hope
you
do
approve
of
nunneries
and
that
sort
of
thing
it
is
such
foolishness
my
dear
the
christian
life
is
very
hard
as
your
aunt
leonora
always
says
she
says
she
ca
bear
to
see
people
playing
at
christianity
people
should
not
speak
of
things
they
do
understand
said
the
perpetual
curate
your
men
aunt
dora
are
like
the
old
ascetics
they
try
to
make
a
merit
of
christianity
by
calling
it
hard
and
terrible
but
there
are
some
sweet
souls
in
the
world
to
whom
it
comes
natural
as
sunshine
in
may
and
the
young
anglican
with
a
glance
behind
him
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
followed
the
fair
figure
which
he
believed
he
was
never
with
a
clear
conscience
to
accompany
any
more
now
here
is
your
inn
he
said
after
a
little
pause
wharfside
is
a
district
where
i
am
going
presently
to
conduct
service
and
the
little
burrowses
are
a
set
of
little
heathens
to
whom
i
am
to
administer
holy
baptism
this
easter
sunday
just
now
oh
frank
my
dear
just
come
in
for
a
moment
and
tell
leonora
it
will
show
her
how
wrong
she
is
said
poor
aunt
dora
clinging
to
his
arm
right
or
wrong
i
am
not
going
into
any
controversy
my
aunt
leonora
knows
perfectly
well
what
she
is
doing
said
the
curate
with
the
best
smile
he
could
muster
and
so
shook
hands
with
her
resolutely
and
walked
back
again
all
the
way
down
grange
lane
past
the
green
door
to
his
own
house
nobody
was
about
the
green
door
at
that
particular
moment
to
ask
him
in
to
luncheon
as
sometimes
happened
he
walked
down
all
the
way
to
mrs
hadwin
with
something
of
the
sensations
of
a
man
who
has
just
gone
through
a
dreadful
operation
and
feels
with
a
kind
of
dull
surprise
after
that
everything
around
him
is
just
the
same
as
before
he
had
come
through
a
fiery
trial
though
nobody
knew
of
it
and
just
at
this
moment
when
he
wanted
all
his
strength
how
strange
to
feel
that
haunting
sense
of
an
unnecessary
sacrifice
that
troubled
new
vein
of
thought
which
would
be
worked
out
and
which
concerned
matters
more
important
than
skelmersdale
weighty
as
that
was
he
took
his
sermon
out
of
his
pocket
when
he
got
home
and
marked
a
cross
upon
it
as
we
have
already
said
but
being
still
a
young
man
he
was
thankful
to
snatch
a
morsel
of
lunch
and
hasten
out
again
to
his
duty
instead
of
staying
to
argue
the
question
with
himself
he
went
to
no
prickett
lane
and
was
a
long
time
with
the
sick
woman
listening
to
all
the
woeful
tale
of
a
troubled
life
which
the
poor
sick
creature
had
been
contemplating
for
days
and
days
in
her
solitude
through
those
strange
exaggerated
which
miss
leonora
would
have
called
the
light
of
eternity
she
remembered
all
sorts
of
sins
great
and
small
which
filled
her
with
nervous
terrors
and
it
was
not
till
close
upon
the
hour
for
the
wharfside
service
that
the
curate
could
leave
his
tremulous
penitent
the
schoolroom
was
particularly
full
that
day
easter
perhaps
had
touched
the
hearts
it
certainly
had
refreshed
the
toilettes
of
the
bargemen
wives
and
daughters
some
of
them
felt
an
inward
conviction
that
their
new
ribbons
were
undoubtedly
owing
to
the
clergyman
influence
and
that
tom
and
jim
would
have
bestowed
the
money
otherwise
before
the
church
planted
her
pickets
in
this
corner
of
the
enemy
camp
and
the
conviction
though
not
of
an
elevated
description
was
a
great
deal
better
than
no
conviction
at
all
mr
wentworth
little
sermon
to
them
was
a
great
improvement
upon
his
sermon
at
st
roque
he
told
them
about
the
empty
grave
of
christ
and
how
he
called
the
weeping
woman
by
her
name
and
showed
her
the
earnest
of
the
end
of
all
sorrows
there
were
some
people
who
cried
thinking
of
the
dead
who
were
still
waiting
for
easter
which
was
more
than
anybody
did
when
mr
wentworth
discoursed
upon
the
beautiful
institutions
of
the
church
year
and
a
great
many
of
the
congregation
stayed
to
see
tom
burrows
six
children
come
up
for
baptism
preceded
by
the
new
baby
whose
infant
claims
to
christianity
the
curate
had
so
strongly
insisted
upon
to
the
wakening
of
a
fatherly
conscience
in
the
honest
bargeman
lucy
wodehouse
without
her
grey
cloak
stood
at
the
font
holding
that
last
tiny
applicant
for
saving
grace
while
all
the
other
little
heathens
were
signed
with
the
sacred
cross
and
strangely
enough
when
the
young
priest
and
the
young
woman
stood
so
near
each
other
solemnly
pledging
one
after
another
each
little
pagan
to
be
christ
faithful
servant
and
soldier
the
cloud
passed
away
from
the
firmament
of
both
neither
of
them
perhaps
was
of
a
very
enlightened
character
of
soul
they
believed
they
were
doing
a
great
work
for
tom
burrows
six
children
calling
god
to
his
promise
on
their
behalf
and
setting
the
little
feet
straight
for
the
gates
of
the
eternal
city
and
in
their
young
love
and
faith
their
hearts
rose
perhaps
it
was
foolish
of
mr
wentworth
to
suffer
himself
to
walk
home
again
thereafter
as
of
old
with
the
miss
wodehouses
but
it
was
so
usual
and
after
all
they
were
going
the
same
way
but
it
was
a
very
silent
walk
to
the
wonder
of
the
elder
sister
who
could
not
understand
what
it
meant
the
wharfside
service
always
does
me
good
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
sigh
and
me
too
said
lucy
and
then
they
talked
a
little
about
the
poor
woman
in
no
but
that
easter
sunday
was
not
like
other
sundays
though
miss
wodehouse
could
not
tell
why
chapter
next
day
the
miss
wentworths
made
a
solemn
call
at
the
rectory
having
known
an
aunt
of
mrs
morgan
at
some
period
of
their
history
and
being
much
disposed
besides
with
natural
curiosity
to
ascertain
all
about
their
nephew
circumstances
their
entrance
interrupted
a
consultation
between
the
rector
and
his
wife
mr
morgan
was
slightly
heated
and
had
evidently
been
talking
about
something
that
excited
him
while
she
poor
lady
looked
just
sufficiently
sympathetic
and
indignant
to
withdraw
her
mind
from
that
first
idea
which
usually
suggested
itself
on
the
entrance
of
visitors
which
was
what
could
they
possibly
think
of
her
if
they
supposed
the
carpet
to
be
her
own
choice
mrs
morgan
cast
her
eye
with
a
troubled
look
upon
the
big
card
which
had
been
brought
to
her
miss
wentworth
miss
leonora
wentworth
miss
dora
wentworth
sisters
of
his
i
suppose
william
she
said
in
an
undertone
now
be
civil
dear
there
was
no
time
for
anything
more
before
the
three
ladies
sailed
in
miss
leonora
took
the
initiative
as
was
natural
you
do
remember
us
i
daresay
she
said
taking
mrs
hand
we
used
to
know
your
aunt
sidney
when
she
lived
at
the
hermitage
do
you
recollect
the
miss
wentworths
of
skelmersdale
charley
sidney
spent
part
of
his
furlough
with
us
last
summer
and
ada
writes
about
you
often
we
could
not
be
in
carlingford
without
coming
to
see
the
relation
of
such
a
dear
friend
i
am
so
glad
to
see
anybody
who
knows
my
aunt
sidney
said
mrs
morgan
with
modified
enthusiasm
mr
morgan
miss
wentworth
it
was
such
a
dear
little
house
that
hermitage
i
spent
some
very
happy
days
there
oh
yes
i
recollect
skelmersdale
perfectly
but
to
tell
the
truth
there
is
one
of
the
clergy
in
carlingford
called
wentworth
and
i
thought
it
might
be
some
relations
of
his
coming
to
call
just
so
said
miss
wentworth
settling
herself
in
the
nearest
and
so
it
is
cried
miss
dora
we
are
his
aunts
dear
boy
we
are
very
fond
of
him
we
came
on
purpose
to
see
him
we
are
so
glad
to
hear
that
he
is
liked
in
carlingford
oh
yes
said
the
rector
wife
and
nobody
else
took
any
notice
of
miss
dora
little
outburst
as
for
mr
morgan
he
addressed
miss
leonora
as
if
she
had
done
something
particularly
naughty
and
he
had
a
great
mind
to
give
her
an
imposition
you
have
not
been
very
long
in
carlingford
i
suppose
said
the
rector
as
if
that
were
a
sin
only
since
saturday
said
miss
leonora
we
came
to
see
mr
frank
wentworth
who
is
at
st
roque
i
do
know
what
your
bishop
is
about
to
permit
all
those
flowers
and
candlesticks
for
my
part
i
never
disguise
my
sentiments
i
mean
to
tell
my
nephew
plainly
that
his
way
of
conducting
the
service
is
far
from
being
to
my
mind
leonora
dear
perhaps
mr
morgan
would
speak
to
frank
about
it
interposed
miss
dora
anxiously
he
was
always
a
dear
boy
and
advice
was
never
lost
upon
him
from
one
that
he
respected
so
much
as
he
must
respect
the
rector
i
beg
your
pardon
i
quite
decline
interfering
with
mr
wentworth
he
is
not
at
all
under
my
jurisdiction
indeed
said
the
rector
with
a
smile
of
anger
i
might
be
more
truly
said
to
be
under
his
for
he
is
good
enough
to
help
in
my
parish
without
consulting
me
but
that
is
not
to
the
purpose
i
would
not
for
the
world
attempt
to
interfere
with
st
roque
dear
i
am
sure
mr
wentworth
is
very
nice
and
everything
we
have
seen
of
him
in
private
we
have
liked
very
much
said
mrs
morgan
with
an
anxious
look
at
her
husband
she
was
a
woman
and
the
handsome
curate
had
impressed
her
favourably
notwithstanding
his
misdoings
as
for
a
little
too
much
of
the
rubric
i
think
that
is
not
a
bad
fault
in
a
young
man
it
gets
softened
down
with
a
little
experience
and
i
do
like
proper
solemnity
in
the
services
of
the
church
i
do
call
intoning
proper
solemnity
said
miss
leonora
the
church
is
a
missionary
institution
that
is
my
idea
unless
you
are
really
bringing
in
the
perishing
and
saving
souls
what
is
the
good
and
souls
will
never
be
saved
by
easter
decorations
i
do
know
what
my
nephew
may
have
done
to
offend
you
mr
morgan
but
it
is
very
sad
to
us
who
have
very
strong
convictions
on
the
subject
to
see
him
wasting
his
time
so
i
daresay
there
is
plenty
of
heathenism
in
carlingford
which
might
be
attacked
in
the
first
place
i
prefer
not
to
discuss
the
subject
said
the
rector
so
long
as
mr
wentworth
or
any
other
clergyman
keeps
to
his
own
sphere
of
duty
i
should
be
the
last
in
the
world
to
interfere
with
him
you
are
offended
with
frank
said
miss
leonora
fixing
her
eyes
upon
mr
morgan
so
am
i
but
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
tell
me
all
about
it
i
have
particular
reasons
for
wishing
to
know
after
all
he
is
only
a
young
man
she
continued
with
that
instinct
of
kindred
which
dislikes
to
hear
censure
from
any
lips
but
its
own
i
do
think
there
can
be
anything
more
than
inadvertence
in
it
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
tell
me
what
you
object
to
in
him
i
think
it
is
probable
that
he
may
remain
a
long
time
in
carlingford
said
miss
leonora
with
charming
candour
and
it
would
be
pleasant
if
we
could
help
to
set
him
right
your
advice
and
experience
might
be
of
so
much
use
to
him
she
was
not
aware
of
the
covert
sarcasm
of
her
speech
she
did
not
know
that
the
rector
actual
experience
though
he
was
half
as
old
again
as
her
nephew
bore
no
comparison
to
that
of
the
perpetual
curate
she
spoke
in
good
faith
and
good
nature
not
moved
in
her
own
convictions
of
what
must
be
done
in
respect
to
skelmersdale
but
very
willing
if
that
were
possible
to
do
a
good
turn
to
frank
i
am
sure
dear
what
we
have
seen
of
mr
wentworth
in
private
we
have
liked
very
much
said
the
rector
sensible
wife
with
a
deprecating
glance
towards
her
husband
the
rector
took
no
notice
of
the
glance
he
grew
slightly
red
in
his
serious
face
and
cleared
his
throat
several
times
before
he
began
to
speak
the
fact
is
i
have
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
mr
wentworth
as
regards
my
own
parish
said
mr
morgan
personally
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
him
quite
the
reverse
probably
as
you
say
it
arises
from
inadvertence
as
he
is
still
a
very
young
man
but
what
has
he
done
said
miss
leonora
pricking
up
her
ears
once
more
mr
morgan
cleared
his
throat
but
this
time
it
was
to
keep
down
the
rising
anger
of
which
he
was
unpleasantly
sensible
i
generally
enter
into
such
matters
with
people
whom
they
do
concern
he
said
with
a
touch
of
his
natural
asperity
but
as
you
are
mr
wentworth
relation
he
has
taken
a
step
perfectly
unjustifiable
in
every
respect
he
has
at
the
present
moment
a
mission
going
on
in
my
parish
in
entire
independence
i
will
not
say
defiance
of
me
my
dear
it
is
unnecessary
to
look
at
me
so
deprecatingly
i
am
indignant
at
having
such
a
liberty
taken
with
me
i
do
pretend
not
to
be
indignant
mr
wentworth
is
a
very
young
man
and
may
not
know
any
better
but
it
is
the
most
unwarrantable
intrusion
upon
a
rights
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
wentworth
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
grievances
but
the
fact
is
my
wife
and
i
were
discussing
this
very
unpleasant
matter
when
you
came
in
a
mission
in
your
parish
said
miss
leonora
her
eyes
lighting
up
with
a
sparkle
which
did
not
look
like
indignation
at
this
point
it
was
necessary
that
miss
dora
should
throw
herself
into
the
breach
oh
mr
morgan
i
am
sure
my
dear
frank
does
not
mean
it
cried
the
unlucky
peacemaker
he
would
not
for
the
world
do
anything
to
wound
anybody
feelings
it
must
be
a
mistake
mr
morgan
would
not
have
mentioned
it
if
we
had
not
just
been
talking
as
you
came
in
said
the
rector
wife
by
way
of
smoothing
down
his
ruffled
temper
and
giving
him
time
to
recover
i
feel
it
is
a
mistake
and
that
everything
will
come
right
as
soon
as
they
can
talk
it
over
by
themselves
the
last
rector
was
not
at
all
a
working
clergyman
and
perhaps
mr
wentworth
felt
it
was
his
duty
and
now
i
daresay
he
forgets
that
it
is
not
his
own
parish
it
will
all
come
right
after
a
time
but
the
mission
is
effective
i
suppose
or
you
would
not
object
to
it
said
miss
leonora
who
though
a
very
religious
woman
was
not
a
peacemaker
and
the
rector
whose
temper
was
hasty
swallowed
the
bait
he
entered
into
his
grievances
more
fully
than
his
wife
thought
consistent
with
his
dignity
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
tracing
the
objectionable
pattern
on
the
carpet
with
her
foot
but
too
much
vexed
for
the
moment
to
think
of
those
bouquets
which
were
so
severe
a
cross
to
her
on
ordinary
occasions
perhaps
she
was
thinking
secretly
to
herself
how
much
better
one
knows
a
man
after
being
married
to
him
three
months
than
after
being
engaged
to
him
ten
years
but
the
discovery
that
he
was
merely
a
man
after
all
with
very
ordinary
defects
did
not
lessen
her
loyalty
she
sat
with
her
eyes
bent
upon
the
carpet
feeling
a
little
hot
and
uncomfortable
as
her
husband
disclosed
his
weakness
and
watching
her
opportunities
to
rush
in
and
say
a
softening
word
now
and
then
the
chances
were
perhaps
on
the
whole
that
the
wife
grew
loyal
if
that
were
possible
as
she
perceived
the
necessity
of
standing
by
him
and
backing
him
out
the
rector
went
very
fully
into
the
subject
being
drawn
out
by
miss
leonora
questions
and
betrayed
an
extent
of
information
strangely
opposed
to
the
utter
ignorance
which
he
had
displayed
at
mr
wodehouse
party
he
knew
the
hours
of
mr
wentworth
services
and
the
number
of
people
who
attended
and
even
about
tom
burrows
six
children
who
had
been
baptised
the
day
before
somehow
mr
morgan
took
this
last
particular
as
a
special
offence
it
was
this
which
had
roused
him
beyond
his
usual
six
little
heathens
brought
into
the
christian
fold
in
his
own
parish
without
the
permission
of
the
rector
it
was
indeed
enough
to
try
any
clergyman
temper
through
the
entire
narrative
miss
dora
broke
in
now
and
then
with
a
little
wail
expressive
of
her
general
dismay
and
grief
and
certainty
that
her
dear
frank
did
not
mean
it
mrs
morgan
repeated
apart
to
miss
wentworth
with
a
troubled
brow
the
fact
that
all
they
had
seen
of
mr
wentworth
in
private
they
had
liked
very
much
to
which
aunt
cecilia
answered
quite
so
with
her
beautiful
smile
while
miss
leonora
sat
and
listened
putting
artful
questions
and
fixing
the
heated
rector
with
that
eye
out
of
which
the
sparkle
of
incipient
light
had
not
faded
mr
morgan
naturally
said
a
great
deal
more
than
he
meant
to
say
and
after
it
was
said
he
was
sorry
but
he
did
not
show
the
latter
sentiment
except
by
silence
and
an
uneasy
rustling
about
the
room
just
before
the
miss
wentworths
rose
to
go
a
sign
apparent
to
his
wife
though
to
nobody
else
he
gave
miss
wentworth
his
arm
to
the
door
with
an
embarrassed
courtesy
if
you
are
going
to
stay
any
time
at
carlingford
i
trust
we
shall
see
more
of
you
said
mr
morgan
i
ought
to
beg
your
pardon
for
taking
up
so
much
time
with
my
affairs
and
the
rector
was
much
taken
aback
when
miss
wentworth
answered
thank
you
that
is
just
what
i
was
thinking
he
went
back
to
his
troubled
wife
in
great
perplexity
what
was
it
that
was
just
what
she
was
thinking
that
he
would
see
more
of
them
or
that
he
had
spoken
too
much
of
his
own
affairs
you
think
i
have
been
angry
and
made
an
idiot
of
myself
said
mr
morgan
to
his
wife
who
was
standing
looking
from
a
safe
distance
through
the
curtains
at
the
three
ladies
who
were
holding
a
consultation
with
their
servant
out
of
the
window
of
the
solemn
chariot
provided
by
the
blue
boar
as
to
where
they
were
to
go
next
nonsense
dear
but
i
wish
you
had
not
said
quite
so
much
about
mr
wentworth
said
the
rector
wife
seizing
with
female
art
on
a
cause
for
her
annoyance
which
would
not
wound
her
welshman
for
i
rather
think
he
is
dependent
on
his
aunts
they
have
the
living
of
skelmersdale
i
know
and
i
remember
now
that
their
nephew
was
to
have
had
it
i
hope
this
wo
turn
them
against
him
dear
said
mrs
morgan
who
did
not
care
the
least
in
the
world
about
skelmersdale
looking
anxiously
in
her
husband
face
this
was
the
climax
of
the
rector
trouble
why
did
not
you
tell
me
that
before
he
said
with
conjugal
injustice
and
went
off
to
his
study
with
a
disturbed
mind
thinking
that
perhaps
he
had
injured
his
own
chances
of
getting
rid
of
the
perpetual
curate
if
mrs
morgan
had
permitted
herself
to
soliloquise
after
he
was
gone
the
matter
of
her
thoughts
might
have
been
interesting
but
as
neither
ladies
nor
gentlemen
in
the
nineteenth
century
are
given
to
that
useful
medium
of
disclosing
their
sentiments
the
veil
of
privacy
must
remain
over
the
mind
of
the
rector
wife
she
got
her
gardening
gloves
and
scissors
and
went
out
immediately
after
and
had
an
animated
discussion
with
the
gardener
about
the
best
means
of
clothing
that
bit
of
wall
over
which
every
railway
train
was
visible
which
left
or
entered
carlingford
that
functionary
was
of
opinion
that
when
the
growed
a
bit
all
would
be
right
but
mrs
morgan
was
reluctant
to
await
the
slow
processes
of
nature
she
forgot
her
vexations
about
mr
wentworth
in
consideration
of
the
still
more
palpable
inconvenience
of
the
passing
train
chapter
vi
miss
dora
wentworth
relapsed
into
suppressed
sobbing
when
the
three
ladies
were
once
more
on
their
way
between
each
little
access
a
few
broken
words
fell
from
the
poor
lady
lips
i
am
sure
dear
frank
did
not
mean
it
she
said
it
was
all
the
plea
his
champion
could
find
for
him
he
did
not
mean
what
to
do
his
duty
and
save
souls
said
miss
leonora
is
that
what
he
did
mean
it
looks
very
much
as
if
he
did
though
as
well
as
he
knew
how
quite
so
leonora
said
miss
wentworth
but
he
could
not
mean
to
vex
the
rector
said
miss
dora
my
poor
dear
frank
of
course
he
meant
it
for
the
very
best
i
wonder
you
do
think
so
leonora
you
who
are
so
fond
of
missions
i
told
you
what
i
heard
him
saying
to
the
young
lady
all
about
the
sick
people
he
was
going
to
visit
and
the
children
he
is
a
faithful
shepherd
though
you
wo
think
so
and
i
am
sure
he
means
nothing
but
his
duty
i
think
said
the
sister
resolutely
indifferent
to
miss
dora
little
sniffs
and
turning
her
gaze
out
of
the
window
unluckily
just
at
the
moment
when
the
carriage
was
passing
shop
where
some
engravings
were
hanging
of
a
suspiciously
devotional
character
the
name
over
the
door
and
the
aspect
of
the
were
terribly
suggestive
and
the
fine
profile
of
the
perpetual
curate
was
just
visible
within
to
the
keen
eyes
of
his
aunt
miss
dora
for
her
part
dried
hers
and
beginning
to
see
some
daylight
addressed
herself
anxiously
to
the
task
of
obscuring
it
and
damaging
once
more
her
favourite
chance
ah
leonora
if
he
had
but
a
sphere
of
his
own
cried
miss
dora
where
he
would
have
other
things
to
think
of
than
the
rubric
and
decorations
and
sisterhoods
i
do
wish
any
harm
to
poor
dear
old
mr
shirley
i
am
sure
but
when
frank
is
in
the
rectory
i
thought
you
understood
that
frank
would
not
do
for
the
rectory
said
miss
leonora
sisterhoods
look
here
there
a
young
lady
in
a
grey
cloak
and
i
think
she
going
into
shop
if
frank
carries
on
that
sort
of
thing
i
shall
think
him
a
greater
fool
than
ever
who
is
that
girl
i
sure
i
do
know
dear
said
miss
dora
with
unexpected
wisdom
and
she
comforted
her
conscience
that
she
did
not
know
for
she
had
forgotten
lucy
name
so
there
was
no
tangible
evidence
to
confirm
miss
leonora
doubts
and
the
carriage
from
the
blue
boar
rattled
down
prickett
lane
to
the
much
amazement
of
that
locality
when
they
got
to
the
grimy
miss
leonora
stopped
the
vehicle
and
got
out
she
declined
the
attendance
of
her
trembling
sister
and
marched
along
the
black
pavement
dispersing
with
the
great
waves
of
her
drapery
the
wondering
children
about
who
swarmed
as
children
will
swarm
in
such
localities
arrived
at
the
schoolroom
miss
leonora
found
sundry
written
notices
hung
up
in
a
little
wooden
frame
inside
the
open
door
all
sorts
of
charitable
businesses
were
carried
on
about
the
basement
of
the
house
and
a
curt
little
notice
about
the
provident
society
diversified
the
list
of
services
which
was
hung
up
for
the
advantage
of
the
ignorant
clearly
the
curate
of
st
meant
it
as
well
as
he
knows
how
his
aunt
allowed
to
herself
with
a
softening
sentiment
but
pushing
her
inquiries
further
was
shown
up
to
the
schoolroom
and
stood
pondering
by
the
side
of
the
looking
at
the
table
which
was
contrived
to
be
so
like
an
altar
the
curate
who
could
not
have
dreamed
of
such
a
visit
and
whose
mind
had
been
much
occupied
and
indifferent
to
externals
on
the
day
before
had
left
various
things
lying
about
which
were
carefully
collected
for
him
upon
a
bench
among
them
was
a
little
pocket
copy
of
thomas
à
kempis
from
which
when
the
jealous
aunt
opened
it
certain
little
german
prints
such
as
were
to
be
had
by
the
score
at
masters
dropped
out
some
of
them
unobjectionable
enough
but
if
the
good
shepherd
could
not
be
found
fault
with
the
feelings
of
miss
leonora
may
be
imagined
when
the
meek
face
of
a
monkish
saint
inscribed
with
some
villanous
latin
inscription
a
legend
which
began
with
the
terrible
words
pro
became
suddenly
visible
to
her
troubled
eyes
she
put
away
the
book
as
if
it
had
stung
her
and
made
a
precipitate
retreat
she
shook
her
head
as
she
descended
the
stair
she
the
carriage
in
gloomy
silence
when
it
returned
up
prickett
lane
the
three
ladies
again
saw
their
nephew
this
time
entering
the
door
of
no
he
had
his
under
his
arm
and
miss
leonora
seized
upon
this
professional
symbol
to
wreak
her
wrath
upon
it
i
wonder
if
he
ca
pray
by
a
sick
woman
without
his
she
cried
i
never
was
so
provoked
in
my
life
how
is
it
he
does
know
better
his
father
is
not
pious
but
he
is
a
puseyite
and
old
uncle
wentworth
was
very
sound
he
was
brought
up
under
the
pure
gospel
how
is
that
the
boys
are
so
foolish
dora
said
miss
leonora
sharply
it
must
be
your
doing
you
have
told
them
tales
and
things
and
put
true
piety
out
of
their
head
my
doing
said
miss
dora
faintly
but
she
was
too
much
startled
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
to
make
any
coherent
remonstrance
miss
leonora
tossed
back
her
angry
head
and
pursued
that
inspiration
finding
it
a
relief
in
her
perplexity
it
must
be
your
doing
she
said
how
can
i
tell
that
you
are
not
a
jesuit
in
disguise
one
has
read
of
such
a
thing
the
boys
were
as
good
nice
pious
boys
as
one
could
wish
to
see
and
there
gerald
on
the
point
of
perversion
and
frank
i
tell
you
dora
it
must
be
your
fault
that
was
always
my
opinion
said
miss
cecilia
and
the
accused
after
a
feeble
attempt
at
speech
could
find
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
drop
her
veil
once
more
and
cry
under
it
it
was
very
hard
but
she
was
not
quite
unaccustomed
to
it
however
the
discoveries
of
the
day
were
important
enough
to
prevent
the
immediate
departure
which
miss
leonora
had
intended
she
wrote
a
note
with
her
own
hands
to
her
nephew
asking
him
to
dinner
we
meant
to
have
gone
away
but
should
like
to
see
you
first
she
said
in
her
note
come
and
dine
we
may
have
anything
pleasant
to
say
but
i
do
suppose
you
expect
that
it
a
pity
we
do
see
eye
to
eye
such
was
the
intimation
received
by
mr
wentworth
when
he
got
home
very
tired
in
the
afternoon
he
had
been
asking
himself
whether
under
the
circumstances
it
would
not
be
proper
of
him
to
return
some
books
of
mr
wodehouse
which
he
had
in
his
possession
of
course
by
way
of
breaking
off
his
too
familiar
too
frequent
intercourse
he
had
been
representing
to
himself
that
he
would
make
this
call
after
their
dinner
would
be
over
at
the
hour
when
mr
wodehouse
reposed
in
his
and
the
two
sisters
were
generally
to
be
found
alone
in
the
perhaps
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
intimating
the
partial
farewell
he
meant
to
take
of
them
when
he
got
miss
leonora
note
the
curate
countenance
clouded
over
he
said
another
night
lost
with
indignant
candour
it
was
hard
enough
to
give
up
his
worldly
prospects
but
he
thought
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
that
however
refusal
was
impossible
it
was
still
daylight
when
he
went
up
grange
lane
to
the
blue
boar
he
was
early
and
went
languidly
along
the
road
nobody
was
about
at
that
hour
in
those
closed
embowered
houses
people
were
preparing
for
dinner
the
great
event
of
the
day
and
mr
wentworth
was
aware
of
that
perhaps
he
had
expected
to
see
somebody
mr
wodehouse
going
home
most
likely
in
order
that
he
might
mention
his
own
engagement
and
account
for
his
failure
in
the
chance
evening
call
which
had
become
so
much
a
part
of
his
life
but
no
one
appeared
to
bear
his
message
he
went
lingering
past
the
green
door
and
up
the
silent
deserted
road
at
the
end
of
grange
lane
just
in
the
little
unsettled
transition
interval
which
interposed
between
its
aristocratic
calm
and
the
bustle
of
george
street
on
the
side
next
prickett
lane
was
a
quaint
little
shop
into
which
mr
wentworth
strayed
to
occupy
the
time
this
was
elsworthy
who
as
is
well
known
was
then
clerk
at
st
roque
elsworthy
himself
was
in
his
shop
that
easter
monday
and
so
was
his
wife
and
little
rosa
who
was
a
little
beauty
rosa
and
her
aunt
had
just
returned
from
an
excursion
and
a
prettier
little
apparition
could
not
be
seen
than
that
dimpled
rosy
creature
with
her
radiant
looks
her
bright
eyes
and
soft
curls
of
hair
even
mr
wentworth
gave
a
second
glance
at
her
as
he
dropped
languidly
into
a
chair
and
asked
elsworthy
if
there
was
any
news
mrs
elsworthy
who
had
been
telling
the
adventures
of
the
holiday
to
her
goodman
gathered
up
her
basket
of
eggs
and
her
nosegay
and
made
the
clergyman
a
little
curtsy
as
she
hurried
away
for
the
clerk
wife
was
a
highly
respectable
woman
and
knew
her
own
place
but
rosa
who
was
only
a
kind
of
kitten
and
had
privileges
stayed
mr
wentworth
was
by
far
the
most
magnificent
figure
she
had
ever
seen
in
her
little
life
she
looked
at
him
with
awe
out
of
her
bright
eyes
and
thought
he
looked
like
the
prince
in
the
fairy
tales
any
news
sir
there
aint
much
to
call
news
sir
not
in
a
place
like
this
said
mr
elsworthy
your
respected
aunts
sir
been
down
at
the
schoolroom
i
have
heard
anything
else
as
i
could
suppose
you
did
know
my
aunts
cried
the
curate
how
do
you
know
anything
about
my
aunts
mr
elsworthy
smiled
a
complacent
and
familiar
smile
there
so
many
and
here
that
i
know
most
persons
as
comes
into
carlingford
said
he
and
them
three
respected
ladies
is
as
good
as
a
pictur
i
saw
them
past
and
down
lane
they
was
as
anxious
to
know
all
about
it
as
as
was
to
be
expected
in
the
circumstances
said
mr
elsworthy
failing
of
a
metaphor
and
i
wish
you
your
and
sir
if
all
as
i
hear
is
true
it
a
good
wish
said
the
curate
thank
you
elsworthy
but
what
you
heard
might
not
be
true
well
sir
it
looks
more
than
likely
said
the
clerk
as
far
as
i
seen
in
my
experience
ladies
do
go
inquiring
into
a
young
gentleman
ways
not
without
some
reason
if
they
was
young
ladies
and
noways
related
we
know
what
we
think
sir
but
being
old
ladies
and
aunts
it
equally
as
clear
for
my
part
mr
wentworth
my
worst
wish
is
that
when
you
come
into
your
fortune
it
may
lead
you
away
from
st
roque
not
after
everything
is
settled
so
beautiful
and
not
a
thing
wanted
but
some
stained
glass
as
i
hear
a
deal
of
people
say
to
make
it
as
perfect
a
little
church
yes
it
is
very
true
a
painted
window
is
very
much
wanted
said
mr
wentworth
thoughtfully
perhaps
there
one
o
the
ladies
sir
as
has
some
friend
she
like
to
put
up
a
memorial
to
said
mr
elsworthy
in
insinuating
tones
a
window
is
a
deal
cheerfuller
a
memorial
than
a
tombstone
and
it
could
be
described
the
improvement
it
would
be
to
the
church
sorry
to
hear
mr
wodehouse
aint
quite
so
well
as
his
usual
a
useful
man
like
he
is
would
be
a
terrible
loss
to
carlingford
not
as
it
anything
alarming
as
far
as
i
can
hear
but
being
a
stout
man
it
aint
a
safe
thing
his
being
took
so
sudden
i
heard
the
old
doctor
say
sir
as
a
man
of
a
full
might
be
took
off
at
once
when
a
spare
man
would
fight
through
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
for
his
family
sir
said
mr
elsworthy
tying
up
a
bundle
of
newspapers
with
a
very
serious
face
good
heavens
elsworthy
how
you
talk
said
the
alarmed
curate
what
do
you
mean
is
mr
wodehouse
ill
seriously
ill
not
serious
as
i
knows
of
said
the
clerk
with
solemnity
but
being
a
man
of
a
full
of
body
i
daresay
as
the
town
would
enter
into
it
by
subscription
if
it
was
proposed
as
a
memorial
to
for
he
much
respected
in
carlingford
is
mr
wodehouse
i
see
him
past
sir
at
five
which
is
an
hour
earlier
than
common
and
he
was
looking
flabby
that
how
he
was
looking
i
do
know
a
man
as
would
be
a
greater
loss
to
his
family
and
they
aint
been
without
their
troubles
either
poor
souls
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
it
was
necessary
to
sacrifice
mr
wodehouse
for
the
sake
of
our
painted
window
said
the
curate
as
that
seems
what
you
mean
send
over
this
note
for
me
please
as
i
have
not
time
to
call
no
certainly
do
send
rosa
that
child
is
too
young
and
too
too
pretty
to
be
out
by
herself
at
night
send
a
boy
have
you
got
a
boy
there
is
a
very
nice
little
fellow
that
i
could
recommend
to
you
said
mr
wentworth
as
he
hastily
scribbled
his
note
with
a
pencil
whose
mother
lives
in
prickett
lane
thank
sir
all
the
same
but
i
hope
i
do
need
to
go
into
that
neighbourhood
for
good
service
said
mr
elsworthy
as
for
rosa
i
could
trust
her
anywhere
and
i
have
a
boy
sir
as
is
the
best
boy
that
ever
lived
a
real
english
boy
that
is
sam
take
this
to
mr
wodehouse
directly
and
wait
for
an
answer
no
answer
very
well
sir
you
need
wait
for
no
answer
sam
that
a
boy
sir
i
could
trust
with
untold
gold
his
mother
a
dissenter
it
is
true
but
the
principles
of
that
boy
is
beautiful
i
hope
you
have
mentioned
sir
as
i
said
mr
wodehouse
was
took
bad
it
was
between
ourselves
mr
wentworth
persons
do
like
especially
when
they
got
to
that
age
and
are
of
a
full
of
body
to
have
every
little
attack
made
a
talk
about
you
excuse
me
mentioning
it
sir
but
it
was
as
between
ourselves
perhaps
you
like
me
to
show
you
my
note
said
the
curate
with
a
smile
which
indeed
elsworthy
would
have
very
much
liked
could
he
have
ventured
to
say
so
mr
wentworth
was
but
too
glad
of
an
excuse
to
write
and
explain
his
absence
the
note
was
not
to
lucy
however
though
various
little
epistles
full
of
the
business
of
the
district
had
passed
between
the
two
dear
miss
i
hear
your
father
is
not
quite
well
i
ca
call
just
now
as
i
am
going
to
dine
with
my
aunts
who
are
at
the
blue
boar
but
if
you
will
pardon
the
lateness
of
the
hour
i
will
call
as
i
return
to
ask
for
ever
yours
c
wentworth
such
was
the
curate
note
while
he
scribbled
it
little
rosa
stood
apart
watching
him
with
admiring
eyes
he
had
said
she
was
too
pretty
to
be
sent
across
grange
lane
by
herself
at
this
hour
though
it
was
still
no
more
than
twilight
and
he
looked
up
at
her
for
an
instant
as
he
said
the
words
quite
enough
to
set
rosa
poor
little
heart
beating
with
childish
romantical
excitement
if
she
could
but
have
peeped
into
the
note
to
see
what
he
said
for
perhaps
after
all
there
might
not
be
anything
between
him
and
miss
lucy
and
perhaps
the
poor
little
thing
stood
watching
deaf
to
her
aunt
call
looking
at
the
strange
ease
with
which
that
small
epistle
was
written
and
thinking
it
half
divine
to
have
such
mastery
of
words
and
pen
mr
wentworth
threw
it
to
sam
as
if
it
were
a
trifle
but
rosa
lively
imagination
could
already
conceive
the
possibility
of
living
upon
such
trifles
and
making
existence
out
of
them
so
the
child
stood
with
her
pretty
curls
about
her
ears
and
her
bright
eyes
gleaming
dewy
over
the
fair
flushed
rosebud
cheeks
in
a
flutter
of
roused
and
innocent
imagination
anticipating
her
fate
as
for
mr
wentworth
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
saw
rosa
as
he
swung
himself
round
upon
the
stool
he
was
seated
on
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
door
somehow
he
was
comforted
in
his
mind
by
the
conviction
that
it
was
his
duty
to
call
at
mr
wodehouse
as
he
came
back
the
evening
brightened
up
and
looked
less
dismal
the
illness
of
the
respected
father
of
the
house
did
not
oppress
the
young
man
he
thought
not
of
the
but
of
the
low
chair
in
one
corner
beside
the
where
lucy
had
always
basketfuls
of
sewing
in
hand
he
could
fancy
he
saw
the
work
drop
on
her
knee
and
the
blue
eyes
raised
it
was
a
pretty
picture
that
he
framed
for
himself
as
he
looked
out
with
a
half
smile
into
the
blue
twilight
through
the
open
door
of
elsworthy
shop
and
it
was
clearly
his
duty
to
call
he
grew
almost
jocular
in
the
exhilaration
of
his
spirits
the
miss
wentworths
do
approve
of
memorial
windows
elsworthy
he
said
and
indeed
if
you
think
it
necessary
to
cut
off
one
of
the
chief
people
in
carlingford
by
way
of
supplying
st
roque
with
a
little
painted
glass
no
sir
no
no
sir
you
too
hard
upon
me
there
was
no
such
meaning
in
my
mind
but
i
do
make
no
question
the
ladies
were
pleased
with
the
church
said
elsworthy
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
man
who
had
helped
to
produce
an
entirely
triumphant
effect
i
pretend
to
be
a
judge
myself
of
what
you
call
art
mr
wentworth
but
if
i
might
venture
an
opinion
the
altar
was
beautiful
and
we
wo
say
nothing
about
the
service
considering
sir
if
you
wo
be
offended
at
putting
them
together
as
one
is
so
far
inferior
that
both
you
and
me
mr
wentworth
laughed
and
moved
off
his
chair
we
were
not
appreciated
in
this
instance
he
said
with
an
odd
comic
look
and
then
went
off
into
a
burst
of
laughter
which
mr
elsworthy
saw
no
particular
occasion
for
then
he
took
up
his
glove
which
he
had
taken
off
to
write
the
note
and
nodding
a
kindly
to
little
rosa
who
stood
gazing
after
him
with
all
her
eyes
went
away
to
the
blue
boar
the
idea
however
of
his
own
joint
performance
with
mr
elsworthy
not
only
tickled
the
curate
but
gave
him
a
sense
of
the
aspect
in
which
he
might
himself
appear
to
the
eyes
of
people
who
differed
with
him
the
joke
had
a
slight
sting
which
brought
his
laughter
to
an
end
he
went
up
through
the
lighted
street
to
the
inn
wishing
the
dinner
over
and
himself
on
his
way
back
again
to
call
at
mr
wodehouse
for
to
tell
the
truth
by
this
time
he
had
almost
exhausted
skelmersdale
and
feeling
in
himself
not
much
different
now
from
what
he
was
when
his
hopes
were
still
green
had
begun
to
look
upon
life
itself
with
a
less
troubled
eye
and
to
believe
in
other
chances
which
might
make
lucy
society
practicable
once
more
it
was
in
this
altered
state
of
mind
that
he
presented
himself
before
his
aunts
he
was
less
less
watchful
more
ready
to
amuse
them
if
that
might
happen
to
be
possible
and
in
reality
much
more
able
to
cope
with
miss
leonora
than
when
he
had
been
more
anxious
about
her
opinion
he
had
not
been
two
minutes
in
the
room
before
all
the
three
ladies
perceived
this
revolution
and
each
in
her
own
mind
attempted
to
account
for
it
they
were
experienced
women
in
their
way
and
found
a
variety
of
reasons
but
as
none
of
them
were
young
and
as
people
forget
how
youth
feels
not
one
of
them
divined
the
fact
that
there
was
no
reason
but
that
this
improvement
of
spirits
arose
solely
from
the
fact
that
the
perpetual
curate
had
been
for
two
whole
days
miserable
about
skelmersdale
and
had
exhausted
all
his
powers
of
misery
and
that
now
youth
had
turned
the
tables
and
he
was
still
to
see
lucy
tonight
chapter
vii
your
rector
is
angry
at
some
of
your
proceedings
said
miss
leonora
i
did
not
think
a
man
of
your
views
would
have
cared
for
missionary
work
i
should
have
supposed
that
you
would
think
that
vulgar
and
and
evangelical
indeed
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
you
did
believe
in
preaching
frank
neither
do
i
when
a
man
preaches
the
tracts
for
the
times
i
was
surprised
to
hear
what
you
were
doing
at
the
place
they
call
wharfside
first
let
me
correct
you
in
two
little
inaccuracies
said
mr
wentworth
blandly
as
he
peeled
his
orange
the
rector
of
carlingford
is
not
rector
and
i
do
preach
the
tracts
for
the
times
let
us
always
be
particular
my
dear
aunt
as
to
points
of
fact
exactly
so
said
miss
leonora
grimly
but
at
the
same
time
as
there
seems
no
great
likelihood
of
your
leaving
carlingford
do
you
think
it
would
be
wise
to
cultivate
friendly
relations
with
the
rector
said
the
inexorable
aunt
looking
full
in
his
eyes
as
she
spoke
so
significant
and
plain
a
statement
took
for
an
instant
the
colour
out
of
the
curate
cheeks
he
pared
his
orange
very
carefully
while
he
regained
his
composure
and
it
was
at
least
half
a
minute
before
he
found
himself
at
leisure
to
reply
miss
dora
of
course
seized
upon
the
opportunity
and
by
way
of
softening
matters
interposed
in
her
unlucky
person
to
make
peace
but
my
dear
boy
i
said
i
was
sure
you
did
not
mean
it
said
miss
dora
i
told
mr
morgan
i
felt
convinced
it
could
be
explained
nobody
knows
you
so
well
as
i
do
you
were
always
from
a
child
and
never
would
give
in
but
i
know
very
well
you
never
could
mean
it
frank
mean
it
said
the
curate
with
sparkling
eyes
what
do
you
take
me
for
aunt
dora
do
you
know
what
it
is
we
are
talking
of
the
question
is
whether
a
whole
lot
of
people
fathers
and
children
shall
be
left
to
live
like
beasts
without
reverence
for
god
or
man
or
shall
be
brought
within
the
pale
of
the
church
and
taught
their
duty
and
you
think
i
do
mean
it
i
mean
it
as
much
as
my
brother
charley
meant
it
at
the
redan
said
young
wentworth
with
a
glow
of
suppressed
enthusiasm
and
that
natural
pride
in
charley
who
got
the
cross
for
valour
which
was
common
to
all
the
wentworths
but
when
he
saw
his
aunt
leonora
looking
at
him
the
perpetual
curate
stood
to
his
arms
again
i
have
still
to
learn
that
the
rector
has
anything
to
do
with
it
said
the
young
evangelist
of
wharfside
it
is
in
his
parish
and
he
thinks
he
has
said
miss
leonora
i
wish
you
could
see
your
duty
more
clearly
frank
you
seem
to
me
you
know
to
have
a
kind
of
zeal
but
not
according
to
knowledge
if
you
were
carrying
the
real
gospel
to
the
poor
people
i
should
be
disposed
to
blame
you
for
the
limits
of
a
parish
are
but
poor
things
to
pause
for
when
souls
are
perishing
but
to
break
the
law
for
the
sake
of
diffusing
the
rubric
and
propagating
tractarianism
oh
leonora
how
can
you
be
so
harsh
and
cruel
cried
miss
dora
only
think
what
you
are
doing
i
do
say
anything
about
disappointing
frank
and
perhaps
injuring
his
prospects
for
life
for
to
be
sure
he
is
a
true
wentworth
and
wo
acknowledge
that
but
think
of
my
poor
dear
brother
with
so
many
sons
as
he
has
to
provide
for
and
so
much
on
his
mind
and
think
of
ourselves
and
all
that
we
have
planned
so
often
only
think
what
you
have
talked
of
over
and
over
how
nice
it
would
be
when
he
was
old
enough
to
take
the
rectory
and
marry
julia
trench
aunt
dora
said
the
curate
rising
from
the
table
i
shall
have
to
go
away
if
you
make
such
appeals
on
my
behalf
and
besides
it
is
only
right
to
tell
you
that
whatever
my
circumstances
were
i
never
could
nor
would
marry
julia
trench
it
is
cruel
and
unjust
to
bring
in
her
name
do
let
us
hear
any
more
of
this
if
you
have
any
regard
for
me
quite
so
frank
said
miss
wentworth
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
thinking
miss
cecilia
was
not
in
the
habit
of
making
demonstrations
but
she
put
out
her
delicate
old
hand
to
point
her
nephew
to
his
seat
again
and
gave
a
soft
slight
pressure
to
his
as
she
touched
it
old
miss
wentworth
was
a
kind
of
dumb
lovely
idol
to
her
nephews
she
rarely
said
anything
to
them
but
they
worshipped
her
all
the
same
for
her
beauty
and
those
languid
tendernesses
which
she
showed
them
once
in
ten
years
or
so
the
perpetual
curate
was
much
touched
by
this
manifestation
he
kissed
his
old
aunt
beautiful
hand
as
reverently
as
if
it
had
been
a
saint
i
knew
you
would
understand
me
he
said
looking
gratefully
at
her
lovely
old
face
which
exclamation
however
was
a
simple
utterance
of
gratitude
and
would
not
have
borne
investigation
when
he
had
resumed
his
seat
and
his
orange
miss
leonora
cleared
her
throat
for
a
grand
address
frank
might
as
well
tell
us
he
would
not
have
skelmersdale
she
said
julia
trench
has
quite
other
prospects
i
am
glad
to
say
though
dora
talks
like
a
fool
on
this
subject
as
well
as
on
many
others
mr
shirley
is
not
dead
yet
and
i
do
think
he
means
to
die
for
my
part
and
julia
would
never
leave
her
uncle
besides
i
think
any
inducement
in
the
world
would
make
her
disguise
herself
like
a
sister
of
mercy
i
hope
she
knows
better
and
it
is
a
pity
that
frank
should
learn
to
think
of
skelmersdale
as
if
it
were
a
family
living
continued
miss
leonora
for
my
part
i
think
people
detached
from
immediate
ties
as
we
are
are
under
all
the
greater
responsibility
but
as
you
are
likely
to
stay
in
carlingford
frank
perhaps
we
could
help
you
with
the
rector
she
concluded
blandly
as
she
ate
her
biscuit
the
curate
who
was
also
a
wentworth
had
quite
recovered
himself
ere
this
speech
was
over
and
proved
himself
equal
to
the
occasion
if
the
rector
objects
to
what
i
am
doing
i
daresay
he
will
tell
me
of
it
said
mr
wentworth
with
indescribable
suavity
i
had
the
consent
of
the
two
former
rectors
to
my
mission
in
their
parish
and
i
do
mean
to
give
up
such
a
work
without
a
cause
but
i
am
equally
obliged
to
you
my
dear
aunt
and
i
hope
mr
shirley
will
live
for
ever
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
in
carlingford
some
of
the
people
would
like
to
call
on
you
if
you
remain
longer
there
are
some
great
friends
of
mine
here
and
as
i
have
every
prospect
of
being
perpetually
the
curate
as
you
kindly
observe
perhaps
it
might
be
good
for
me
if
i
was
seen
to
have
such
unexceptionable
relationships
satire
is
lost
upon
me
said
miss
leonora
and
we
are
going
here
comes
the
coffee
i
did
not
think
it
had
been
so
late
we
shall
leave
by
an
early
train
and
you
can
come
and
see
us
off
if
you
have
time
i
shall
certainly
find
time
said
the
nephew
with
equal
politeness
and
now
you
will
permit
me
to
say
for
i
have
a
one
of
my
sick
people
to
visit
i
heard
he
was
ill
only
as
i
came
here
and
had
not
time
to
call
added
the
curate
with
unnecessary
explanitoriness
and
took
leave
of
his
aunt
cecilia
who
softly
put
something
into
his
hand
as
she
bade
him
miss
dora
for
her
part
went
with
him
to
the
door
and
lingered
leaning
on
his
arm
down
the
long
passage
all
unaware
poor
lady
that
his
heart
was
beating
with
impatience
to
get
away
and
that
the
disappointment
for
which
she
wanted
to
console
him
had
at
the
present
moment
not
the
slightest
real
hold
upon
his
perverse
heart
oh
my
dear
boy
i
hope
you
do
think
it
my
fault
said
miss
dora
with
tears
it
must
have
come
to
this
dear
sooner
or
later
you
see
poor
leonora
has
such
a
sense
of
responsibility
but
it
is
very
hard
upon
us
frank
who
love
you
so
much
that
she
should
always
take
her
own
way
then
why
do
you
rebel
said
the
curate
who
in
the
thought
of
seeing
lucy
was
exhilarated
and
dared
to
jest
even
upon
the
awful
power
of
his
aunt
you
are
two
against
one
why
do
you
take
it
into
your
own
hands
and
rebel
miss
dora
repeated
the
words
with
an
alarmed
quiver
rebel
oh
frank
dear
do
you
think
we
could
to
be
sure
we
are
and
have
just
as
good
a
right
as
she
has
and
for
your
sake
my
dear
boy
said
the
troubled
woman
oh
frank
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
to
do
i
never
should
dare
to
contradict
leonora
with
no
one
to
stand
by
me
and
then
if
anything
happened
you
would
all
think
i
had
been
to
blame
said
poor
aunt
dora
clinging
to
his
arm
she
made
him
walk
back
and
back
again
through
the
long
passage
which
was
sacred
to
the
chief
suite
of
apartments
at
the
blue
boar
we
have
it
all
to
ourselves
and
nobody
can
see
us
here
and
oh
my
dear
boy
if
you
would
only
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
she
repeated
with
wistful
looks
of
appeal
mr
wentworth
was
too
to
show
the
impatience
with
which
he
was
struggling
he
satisfied
her
as
well
as
he
could
and
said
times
when
he
made
his
escape
at
last
and
emerged
into
the
clear
blue
air
of
the
spring
night
the
perpetual
curate
had
no
such
sense
of
disappointment
and
failure
in
his
mind
as
the
three
ladies
supposed
miss
distinct
intimation
that
skelmersdale
had
passed
out
of
the
region
of
probabilities
had
indeed
tingled
through
him
at
the
moment
it
was
uttered
but
just
now
he
was
going
to
see
lucy
anticipating
with
impatience
the
moment
of
coming
into
her
presence
and
nothing
in
the
world
could
have
dismayed
him
utterly
he
went
down
the
road
very
rapidly
glad
to
find
that
it
was
still
so
early
that
the
shopkeepers
in
george
street
were
but
just
putting
up
their
shutters
and
that
there
was
still
time
for
an
hour
talk
in
that
bright
little
rosa
was
standing
at
the
door
of
elsworthy
shop
looking
out
into
the
dark
street
as
he
passed
and
he
said
a
lovely
night
rosa
as
he
went
by
but
the
night
was
nothing
particular
in
itself
only
lovely
to
mr
wentworth
as
embellished
with
lucy
shining
over
it
like
a
distant
star
perhaps
he
had
never
in
his
life
felt
so
glad
that
he
was
going
to
see
her
so
eager
for
her
presence
as
that
night
which
was
the
beginning
of
the
time
when
it
would
be
no
longer
lawful
for
him
to
indulge
in
her
society
he
heaved
a
big
sigh
as
that
thought
occurred
to
him
but
it
did
not
diminish
the
flush
of
conscious
happiness
and
in
this
mood
he
went
down
grange
lane
with
light
resounding
steps
to
mr
wodehouse
door
but
mr
wentworth
started
with
a
very
strange
sensation
when
the
door
was
stealthily
noiselessly
opened
to
him
before
he
could
ring
he
could
not
see
who
it
was
that
called
him
in
the
darkness
but
he
felt
that
he
had
been
watched
for
and
that
the
door
was
thrown
open
very
hurriedly
to
prevent
him
from
making
his
usual
summons
at
the
bell
such
an
incident
was
incomprehensible
he
went
into
the
dark
garden
like
a
man
in
a
dream
with
a
horrible
vision
of
archimage
and
the
false
una
somehow
stealing
upon
his
mind
he
could
not
tell
how
it
was
quite
dark
inside
for
the
moon
was
late
of
rising
that
night
and
the
faint
stars
threw
no
effectual
lustre
down
upon
the
trees
he
had
to
grope
before
him
to
know
where
he
was
going
asking
in
a
troubled
voice
who
is
there
what
is
the
matter
and
falling
into
more
and
more
profound
bewilderment
and
uneasiness
hush
hush
oh
hush
oh
mr
wentworth
it
is
i
i
want
to
speak
to
you
said
an
agitated
voice
beside
him
come
this
way
this
way
i
do
want
any
one
to
hear
us
it
was
miss
wodehouse
who
thus
pitifully
addressed
the
amazed
curate
she
laid
a
tremulous
hand
on
his
arm
and
drew
him
deeper
into
the
shadows
into
that
walk
where
the
limes
and
tall
grew
so
thickly
here
she
came
to
a
pause
and
the
sound
of
the
terrified
panting
breath
in
the
silence
alarmed
him
more
and
more
is
mr
wodehouse
ill
what
has
happened
said
the
astonished
young
man
the
windows
of
the
house
were
gleaming
hospitably
over
the
dark
garden
without
any
appearance
of
gloom
the
windows
especially
which
he
knew
so
well
brightly
lighted
one
of
them
open
and
the
sound
of
the
piano
and
lucy
voice
stealing
out
like
a
celestial
reality
into
the
darkness
by
the
time
he
had
become
fully
sensible
of
all
these
particulars
his
agitated
companion
had
found
her
breath
mr
wentworth
do
think
me
mad
said
miss
wodehouse
i
have
come
out
to
speak
to
you
for
i
am
in
great
distress
i
do
know
what
to
do
unless
you
will
help
me
oh
no
do
look
at
the
house
nobody
knows
in
the
house
i
would
die
rather
than
have
them
know
hush
hush
do
make
any
noise
is
that
some
one
looking
out
at
the
door
and
just
then
the
door
was
opened
and
mr
wodehouse
sole
male
servant
looked
out
and
round
the
garden
as
if
he
had
heard
something
to
excite
his
curiosity
or
surprise
miss
wodehouse
grasped
the
arm
of
the
perpetual
curate
and
held
him
with
an
energy
which
was
almost
violence
hush
hush
hush
she
said
with
her
voice
almost
at
his
ear
the
excitement
of
this
mild
woman
the
perfectly
inexplicable
mystery
of
the
meeting
overwhelmed
young
wentworth
he
could
think
of
nothing
less
than
that
she
had
lost
her
senses
and
in
his
turn
he
took
her
hands
and
held
her
fast
what
is
the
matter
i
can
not
tell
you
how
anxious
how
distressed
i
am
what
has
happened
said
the
young
man
under
his
breath
my
father
has
some
suspicion
she
answered
after
a
pause
he
came
home
early
looking
you
heard
of
it
mr
wentworth
it
was
your
note
that
decided
me
oh
heaven
help
us
it
is
so
hard
to
know
what
to
do
i
have
never
been
used
to
act
for
myself
and
i
feel
as
helpless
as
a
baby
the
only
comfort
i
have
was
that
it
happened
on
easter
sunday
said
the
poor
gentlewoman
incoherently
and
oh
if
it
should
prove
a
rising
from
the
dead
if
you
saw
me
mr
wentworth
you
would
see
i
look
ten
years
older
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
is
but
i
think
my
father
has
suspicions
he
looked
so
ill
oh
so
ill
when
he
came
home
hush
hush
did
you
hear
anything
i
dare
tell
lucy
not
that
i
could
trust
her
but
it
is
cruel
when
a
young
creature
is
happy
to
let
her
know
such
miseries
oh
mr
wentworth
i
daresay
i
am
not
telling
you
what
it
is
after
all
i
do
know
what
i
am
saying
wait
till
i
can
think
it
was
on
easter
sunday
after
we
came
home
from
wharfside
you
remember
we
all
came
home
together
and
both
lucy
and
you
were
so
quiet
i
could
not
understand
how
it
was
you
were
so
quiet
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
any
trouble
and
then
all
at
once
there
he
was
who
said
the
curate
forgetting
caution
in
his
bewilderment
once
more
the
door
opened
and
john
appeared
on
the
steps
this
time
with
a
lantern
and
the
a
great
brown
mastiff
by
his
side
evidently
with
the
intention
of
searching
the
garden
for
the
owners
of
those
furtive
voices
mr
wentworth
drew
the
arm
of
his
trembling
companion
within
his
own
i
do
know
what
you
want
of
me
but
whatever
it
is
trust
to
me
like
like
a
brother
he
said
with
a
sigh
but
now
compose
yourself
we
must
go
into
the
house
it
will
not
do
for
you
to
be
found
here
he
led
her
up
the
into
the
light
of
the
lantern
which
the
vigilant
guardian
of
the
house
was
flashing
among
the
bushes
as
he
set
out
upon
his
rounds
john
fell
back
amazed
but
respectful
when
he
saw
his
mistress
and
the
familiar
visitor
beg
your
pardon
but
i
knew
there
was
voices
and
i
did
know
as
any
of
the
family
was
in
the
garden
said
the
man
discomfited
it
was
all
mr
wentworth
could
do
to
hold
up
the
trembling
figure
by
his
side
as
john
retreated
she
gathered
a
little
fortitude
perhaps
it
was
easier
for
her
to
tell
her
hurried
tremulous
story
as
he
guided
back
to
the
house
than
it
would
have
been
in
uninterrupted
leisure
and
quiet
the
family
tragedy
fell
in
broken
sentences
from
her
lips
as
the
curate
bent
down
his
astonished
ear
to
listen
he
was
totally
unprepared
for
the
secret
which
only
her
helplessness
and
weakness
and
anxiety
to
serve
her
father
could
have
drawn
from
miss
wodehouse
lips
and
it
had
to
be
told
so
hurriedly
that
mr
wentworth
scarcely
knew
what
it
was
except
a
terrible
unsuspected
shadow
overhanging
the
powerful
house
until
he
had
time
to
think
it
all
over
there
was
no
such
time
at
this
moment
his
trembling
companion
left
him
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
house
to
compose
herself
as
she
said
when
he
saw
her
face
in
the
light
of
the
hall
lamp
it
was
ghastly
and
quivering
with
agitation
looking
not
ten
years
as
she
said
but
a
hundred
years
older
than
when
in
the
sweet
precision
of
her
sunday
dress
and
looks
old
miss
wodehouse
had
bidden
him
at
the
green
door
he
went
up
to
the
notwithstanding
with
as
calm
a
countenance
as
he
himself
could
collect
to
pay
the
visit
which
in
this
few
minutes
had
so
entirely
changed
in
character
mr
wentworth
felt
as
if
he
saw
everything
exactly
as
he
had
pictured
it
to
himself
half
an
hour
ago
lucy
who
had
left
the
piano
was
seated
in
her
low
chair
again
not
working
but
talking
to
mr
wodehouse
who
lay
on
the
sofa
looking
a
trifle
less
rosy
than
usual
like
a
man
who
had
had
a
fright
or
been
startled
by
some
possible
shadow
of
a
ghost
to
walk
into
the
room
into
the
bright
household
glow
and
smile
and
shake
hands
with
them
feeling
all
the
time
that
he
knew
more
about
them
than
they
themselves
did
was
the
strangest
sensation
to
the
young
man
he
asked
how
mr
wodehouse
did
with
a
voice
which
to
himself
sounded
hollow
and
unnatural
and
sat
down
beside
the
invalid
almost
turning
his
back
upon
lucy
in
his
bewilderment
it
was
indeed
with
a
great
effort
that
mr
wentworth
mastered
himself
and
was
able
to
listen
to
what
his
companion
said
we
are
all
right
said
mr
wodehouse
a
trifle
of
a
headache
or
so
nothing
to
make
a
talk
about
but
molly
has
forsaken
us
and
we
were
just
about
getting
bored
with
each
other
lucy
and
i
a
third
person
was
all
we
wanted
to
make
us
happy
eh
well
i
thought
you
looked
at
the
door
very
often
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
but
i
could
have
sworn
you
were
listening
and
looking
for
somebody
no
wonder
either
i
do
think
so
i
should
have
done
just
the
same
at
your
age
indeed
papa
you
are
quite
mistaken
said
lucy
i
suppose
that
means
that
i
can
not
amuse
you
by
myself
though
i
have
been
trying
all
the
evening
perhaps
mr
wentworth
will
be
more
fortunate
and
either
for
shame
of
being
supposed
to
look
for
him
or
in
a
little
innocent
pique
she
moved
away
from
where
she
was
sitting
and
rang
for
tea
and
left
the
two
gentlemen
to
talk
to
each
other
that
is
to
say
mr
wodehouse
talked
and
the
perpetual
curate
sat
looking
vaguely
at
the
fair
figure
which
flitted
about
the
room
and
wondering
if
he
were
awake
or
the
world
still
in
its
usual
place
after
a
while
miss
wodehouse
came
in
very
tremulous
and
pale
and
dropped
into
the
first
chair
she
could
find
and
pretended
to
occupy
herself
over
her
knitting
she
had
a
headache
lucy
said
and
mr
wentworth
sat
watching
while
the
younger
sister
tended
the
elder
bringing
her
tea
kissing
her
persuading
her
to
go
and
lie
down
taking
all
kinds
of
affectionate
trouble
to
cheer
the
pale
woman
who
looked
over
lucy
fair
head
with
eyes
full
of
meaning
to
the
bewildered
visitor
who
was
the
only
one
there
who
understood
what
her
trouble
meant
when
he
got
up
to
go
away
she
wrung
his
hand
with
a
pitiful
gaze
which
went
to
his
heart
let
me
know
she
said
in
a
whisper
and
not
satisfied
still
went
to
the
door
with
him
and
lingered
upon
the
stair
following
slowly
oh
mr
wentworth
be
sure
you
let
me
know
she
repeated
again
looking
wistfully
after
him
as
he
disappeared
into
the
dark
garden
going
out
the
stars
were
still
shining
the
spring
dews
lying
sweet
upon
the
plants
and
turf
it
was
a
lovelier
night
now
than
when
mr
wentworth
had
said
so
to
little
rosa
elsworthy
an
hour
ago
but
mists
were
rising
from
the
earth
and
clouds
creeping
over
the
sky
to
the
startled
imagination
of
the
perpetual
curate
he
had
found
out
by
practical
experiments
almost
for
the
first
time
that
there
were
more
things
in
earth
and
heaven
than
are
dreamt
of
in
the
philosophy
of
youth
chapter
viii
it
was
the
next
morning
after
this
when
mrs
hadwin
strange
lodger
first
appeared
in
the
astonished
house
he
was
the
strangest
lodger
to
be
taken
into
a
house
of
such
perfect
respectability
a
house
in
grange
lane
and
it
came
to
be
currently
reported
in
carlingford
after
a
time
when
people
knew
more
about
it
that
even
the
servants
could
not
tell
when
or
how
he
arrived
but
had
woke
up
one
morning
to
find
a
pair
of
boots
standing
outside
the
closed
door
of
the
green
room
which
the
good
old
lady
kept
for
company
with
sensations
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
such
a
pair
of
boots
they
were
too
muddy
beyond
expression
with
old
mud
which
had
not
been
brushed
off
for
days
worn
shapeless
and
patched
at
the
sides
the
strangest
contrast
to
a
handsome
pair
of
mr
wentworth
which
he
contrary
to
his
usual
neat
habits
had
kicked
off
in
his
and
which
sarah
the
housemaid
had
brought
and
set
down
on
the
landing
close
by
these
mysterious
and
unaccountable
articles
when
the
bell
of
the
green
room
rang
an
hour
or
two
later
sarah
and
the
cook
who
happened
to
be
standing
together
jumped
three
yards
apart
and
stared
at
each
other
the
sound
gave
them
both
a
turn
but
they
soon
got
perfectly
well
used
to
that
bell
from
the
green
room
it
rung
very
often
in
the
day
for
the
gentleman
chose
to
sit
there
more
than
half
his
time
and
if
other
people
were
private
about
him
it
was
a
great
deal
more
than
he
was
about
himself
he
even
sent
the
boots
to
be
mended
to
sarah
shame
and
confusion
for
the
credit
of
the
house
the
girl
invented
a
story
about
them
to
calm
the
cobbler
suspicions
they
was
the
easiest
boots
the
gentleman
had
being
troubled
with
tender
feet
and
he
was
to
give
them
up
because
they
was
shabby
said
sarah
he
sent
down
his
shabby
clothes
to
be
brushed
and
wore
mr
wentworth
linen
to
the
indignation
of
the
household
but
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
concealed
in
a
corner
from
where
he
sat
in
the
green
room
he
whistled
so
beautifully
that
mrs
hadwin
own
pet
canary
paused
astonished
to
listen
and
the
butcher
boy
stole
into
the
kitchen
surreptitiously
to
try
if
he
could
learn
the
art
and
while
he
whistled
he
filled
the
tidy
room
with
parings
and
cuttings
of
wood
and
carved
out
all
kinds
of
pretty
articles
with
his
knife
but
though
he
rang
his
bell
so
often
and
was
so
tiresome
with
his
litter
and
gave
so
much
trouble
sarah
heart
after
a
while
melted
to
the
gentleman
he
made
her
a
present
of
a
needlecase
and
was
very
more
so
a
great
deal
than
the
curate
of
st
roque
and
such
a
subject
of
talk
and
curiosity
had
certainly
not
been
in
carlingford
for
a
hundred
years
as
for
mrs
hadwin
she
never
gave
any
explanation
at
all
on
the
subject
but
accepted
the
fact
of
a
new
inmate
cheerfully
as
if
she
knew
all
about
it
of
course
she
could
not
ask
any
of
her
nieces
to
visit
her
while
the
green
room
was
occupied
and
as
they
were
all
rather
large
interfering
managing
women
perhaps
the
old
lady
was
not
very
sorry
mr
wentworth
himself
was
still
less
explanatory
when
mr
wodehouse
said
to
him
what
is
this
i
hear
about
a
brother
of
yours
they
tell
me
you
got
a
brother
staying
with
you
well
that
what
i
hear
why
do
you
bring
him
up
to
dinner
come
the
perpetual
curate
calmly
answered
thank
you
but
there
no
brother
of
mine
in
carlingford
and
took
no
further
notice
naturally
however
this
strange
apparition
was
much
discussed
in
grange
lane
the
servants
first
and
then
the
ladies
became
curious
about
him
sometimes
in
the
evenings
he
might
be
seen
coming
out
of
mrs
hadwin
a
shabby
figure
walking
softly
in
his
patched
boots
there
never
was
light
enough
for
any
one
to
see
him
but
he
had
a
great
beard
and
smoked
a
short
little
pipe
and
had
evidently
no
regard
for
appearances
it
was
a
kind
of
thing
which
few
people
approved
of
mrs
hadwin
ought
not
to
permit
it
some
ladies
said
and
a
still
greater
number
were
of
the
opinion
that
rather
than
endure
so
strange
a
the
curate
ought
to
withdraw
and
find
fresh
lodgings
this
was
before
the
time
when
the
public
began
to
associate
the
stranger
in
a
disagreeable
way
with
mr
wentworth
before
they
came
to
that
the
people
in
grange
lane
bethought
themselves
of
all
mrs
hadwin
connections
to
find
out
if
there
might
not
be
some
of
them
under
hiding
and
of
course
that
excellent
woman
had
a
nephew
or
two
whose
conduct
was
not
perfect
and
then
it
came
to
be
reported
that
it
was
mr
wentworth
brother
that
it
was
an
unfortunate
college
chum
of
his
that
it
was
somebody
who
had
speculated
and
whom
the
curate
had
gone
shares
with
but
in
the
mean
time
no
real
information
could
be
obtained
about
this
mysterious
stranger
the
butcher
boy
whose
senses
were
quickened
by
mingled
admiration
and
envy
heard
him
whistling
all
day
long
sometimes
hidden
among
the
trees
in
the
garden
sometimes
from
the
open
window
of
the
green
room
where
indeed
lady
western
page
was
ready
to
take
his
oath
he
had
once
seen
the
audacious
unknown
leaning
out
in
the
twilight
smoking
a
pipe
but
no
trap
of
conversation
however
ingenious
and
many
traps
were
laid
for
mr
wentworth
ever
elicited
from
the
perpetual
curate
any
acknowledgment
of
the
other
existence
the
young
anglican
opened
his
fine
eyes
a
little
wider
than
usual
when
he
was
asked
sympathetically
whether
so
many
people
in
the
house
did
not
interfere
with
his
quiet
mrs
hadwin
talk
is
very
gentle
said
the
curate
she
never
disturbs
me
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
equally
obtuse
and
would
not
comprehend
any
allusion
the
little
household
came
to
be
very
much
talked
of
in
carlingford
in
consequence
and
to
meet
that
shabby
figure
in
the
evening
when
one
chanced
to
be
out
for
a
walk
made
one
company
sought
after
in
the
best
circles
of
society
though
the
fact
is
that
people
began
to
be
remiss
in
calling
upon
mrs
hadwin
and
a
great
many
only
left
their
cards
as
soon
as
it
became
evident
that
she
did
not
mean
to
give
any
explanation
to
have
the
curate
to
stay
with
her
was
possible
without
infringing
upon
her
position
but
matters
became
very
different
when
she
showed
herself
willing
to
take
any
one
even
when
in
equivocal
apparel
and
patched
boots
probably
the
curate
had
his
own
troubles
during
this
period
of
his
history
he
was
noticed
to
be
a
little
quick
and
short
in
his
temper
for
some
time
after
easter
for
one
thing
his
aunts
did
not
go
away
they
stayed
in
the
blue
boar
and
sent
for
him
to
dinner
till
the
impatience
grew
almost
beyond
bearing
it
was
a
discipline
upon
which
he
had
not
calculated
and
which
exceeded
the
bounds
of
endurance
especially
as
miss
leonora
questioned
him
incessantly
about
his
work
and
still
dangled
before
him
like
an
unattainable
before
a
child
the
comforts
and
advantages
of
skelmersdale
where
poor
old
mr
shirley
had
rallied
for
the
fiftieth
time
the
situation
altogether
was
very
tempting
to
miss
leonora
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
go
away
and
leave
such
a
very
pretty
quarrel
in
progress
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
would
have
been
highly
gratifying
to
her
vanity
as
an
evangelical
woman
to
have
had
her
nephew
brought
to
task
for
missionary
work
carried
on
in
another
man
parish
even
though
that
work
was
not
conducted
entirely
on
her
own
principles
she
lingered
accordingly
with
a
great
hankering
after
wharfside
to
which
mr
wentworth
steadily
declined
to
afford
her
any
access
she
went
to
the
afternoon
service
sometimes
it
is
true
but
only
to
be
afflicted
in
her
soul
by
the
sight
of
miss
wodehouse
and
lucy
in
their
grey
cloaks
not
to
speak
of
the
rubric
to
which
the
curate
was
so
faithful
it
was
a
trying
experience
to
his
evangelical
aunt
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
great
work
and
she
could
not
give
up
the
hope
of
being
able
one
time
or
other
to
appropriate
the
credit
of
it
and
win
him
over
to
her
own
views
if
that
consummation
could
but
be
attained
everything
would
become
simple
and
miss
leonora
was
a
true
wentworth
and
wanted
to
see
her
nephew
in
skelmersdale
so
it
may
easily
be
understood
that
under
present
circumstances
there
were
great
attractions
for
her
in
carlingford
it
was
accordingly
with
a
beating
heart
that
miss
dora
feeling
a
little
as
she
might
have
been
supposed
to
feel
thirty
years
before
had
she
ever
stolen
forth
from
the
enclosure
of
skelmersdale
park
to
see
a
lover
put
on
her
bonnet
in
the
early
twilight
and
escaping
with
difficulty
the
lively
observations
of
her
maid
went
tremulously
down
grange
lane
to
her
nephew
house
she
had
never
yet
visited
frank
and
this
visit
was
unquestionably
clandestine
but
then
the
news
with
which
her
heart
was
beating
was
important
enough
to
justify
the
step
she
was
taking
at
least
so
she
whispered
to
herself
though
whether
dear
frank
would
be
pleased
or
whether
he
would
still
think
it
my
fault
poor
miss
dora
could
not
make
up
her
mind
nothing
happened
in
the
quiet
road
where
there
were
scarcely
any
passengers
and
the
poor
lady
arrived
with
a
trembling
sense
of
escape
from
unknown
perils
at
mrs
hadwin
for
miss
dora
was
of
opinion
like
some
few
other
ladies
that
to
walk
alone
down
the
quietest
of
streets
was
to
lay
herself
open
to
dangers
she
put
out
her
trembling
hand
to
ring
the
bell
thinking
her
perils
over
for
of
course
frank
would
walk
home
with
her
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
a
terrible
apparition
quite
unconscious
of
anybody
standing
there
marched
straight
out
upon
miss
dora
who
gave
a
little
scream
and
staggered
backwards
thinking
the
worst
horrors
she
had
dreamed
of
were
about
to
be
realised
they
were
so
close
together
that
the
terrified
lady
took
in
every
detail
of
his
appearance
she
saw
the
patched
boots
and
that
shabby
coat
which
sarah
the
housemaid
felt
that
she
rather
demeaned
herself
by
brushing
it
looked
too
small
for
him
as
coats
will
do
when
they
get
shabby
and
to
complete
the
alarming
appearance
of
the
man
he
had
no
hat
but
only
a
little
surmounting
the
redundancy
of
hair
mustache
and
beard
which
were
enough
of
themselves
to
strike
any
nervous
woman
with
terror
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
cried
poor
miss
dora
hysterically
i
wanted
to
see
mr
wentworth
and
she
stood
trembling
and
panting
for
breath
holding
by
the
wall
not
quite
sure
that
this
apparition
could
be
appeased
by
any
amount
of
apologies
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
her
when
the
monster
took
off
its
cap
and
when
she
perceived
by
the
undulations
of
the
beard
something
like
a
smile
upon
its
hidden
lips
i
believe
mr
wentworth
is
at
church
said
the
new
lodger
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
safely
across
to
st
roque
at
which
speech
miss
dora
trembled
more
and
more
and
said
faintly
no
thank
you
for
who
could
tell
what
the
intentions
might
be
the
result
was
however
that
he
only
put
on
his
cap
again
and
went
off
like
any
other
human
creature
in
the
other
direction
and
that
slowly
with
tremulous
steps
miss
dora
pursued
her
way
to
her
nephew
pretty
church
she
could
not
have
described
as
she
herself
said
what
a
relief
it
was
after
all
this
to
take
arm
as
she
met
him
at
the
door
of
st
roque
he
was
coming
out
and
the
young
lady
with
the
grey
cloak
had
been
one
of
the
congregation
and
to
tell
the
truth
miss
dora
was
an
unwelcome
addition
just
then
to
the
party
lucy
coming
had
been
accidental
and
it
was
very
sweet
to
mr
wentworth
to
be
able
to
conclude
that
he
was
obliged
to
walk
home
with
her
they
were
both
coming
out
from
their
evening
devotions
into
the
tranquil
spring
twilight
very
glad
of
the
charmed
quiet
and
happy
somehow
to
find
themselves
alone
together
that
had
happened
but
seldom
of
late
and
a
certain
expectation
of
something
that
might
happen
hovered
over
the
heads
of
lucy
and
the
curate
it
did
not
matter
that
he
dared
not
say
to
her
what
was
in
his
heart
mr
wentworth
was
only
a
young
man
after
all
and
the
thrill
of
a
possible
revelation
was
upon
him
in
that
upon
which
he
was
entering
with
so
profound
a
sense
of
happiness
and
then
it
was
an
accidental
meeting
and
if
anything
did
happen
they
could
not
blame
themselves
as
if
they
had
sought
this
opportunity
of
being
together
the
circumstances
were
such
that
they
might
call
it
providential
if
anything
came
of
it
but
just
as
the
two
had
made
their
first
step
out
of
the
church
where
the
organ
was
still
murmuring
low
in
the
darkness
and
where
the
music
of
the
last
amen
in
which
he
had
recognised
lucy
voice
had
not
quite
died
from
the
curate
ears
to
meet
miss
dora
pale
and
fluttered
full
of
news
and
distress
with
no
other
thought
in
her
mind
but
to
appropriate
her
dear
frank
and
take
his
arm
and
gain
his
ear
it
was
very
hard
upon
the
perpetual
curate
as
for
lucy
she
of
course
did
not
say
anything
but
merely
arranged
her
veil
and
greeted
miss
wentworth
sweetly
lucy
walked
on
the
other
side
of
the
curate
saying
little
as
miss
dora
eager
shower
of
questions
and
remarks
ran
on
perhaps
she
had
a
little
insight
into
mr
wentworth
feelings
and
no
doubt
it
was
rather
tantalising
when
they
came
to
mrs
hadwin
door
the
young
anglican
made
a
spasmodic
effort
which
in
his
heart
he
felt
to
be
unprincipled
and
which
had
it
been
successful
would
have
totally
taken
away
the
accidental
and
unpremeditated
character
of
this
walk
with
lucy
which
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
relinquish
he
proposed
that
his
aunt
should
go
in
and
rest
while
he
saw
miss
wodehouse
safely
home
he
was
sure
she
was
tired
he
said
eagerly
no
my
dear
not
at
all
said
miss
dora
it
is
such
a
pleasant
evening
and
i
know
miss
wodehouse
is
not
very
far
off
i
should
like
the
walk
and
besides
it
is
too
late
you
know
to
see
mrs
hadwin
and
i
should
not
like
to
go
in
without
calling
on
her
and
besides
mr
wentworth
in
his
aggravation
gave
a
momentary
sudden
glance
at
lucy
when
she
had
no
expectation
of
it
that
glance
of
disappointment
of
disgust
of
love
and
longing
was
no
more
intentional
than
their
meeting
could
he
help
it
if
it
revealed
that
heart
which
was
in
such
a
state
of
commotion
and
impatience
anyhow
the
look
gave
lucy
sufficient
occupation
to
keep
her
very
quiet
on
the
other
side
while
miss
dora
maundered
on
i
met
the
strangest
man
coming
out
when
i
was
going
to
ring
your
bell
you
will
think
it
very
foolish
frank
but
he
frightened
me
she
said
a
man
with
a
terrible
beard
and
a
a
shabby
man
my
dear
who
could
it
be
not
a
person
to
be
seen
coming
out
of
a
house
where
a
clergyman
lives
he
could
not
be
any
friend
of
yours
the
other
lodger
i
suppose
said
the
curate
briefly
when
are
you
going
away
oh
my
dear
boy
we
are
not
going
away
i
came
to
tell
you
but
frank
you
do
mean
to
say
that
such
a
man
as
that
lodges
in
mrs
hadwin
house
i
do
think
it
is
safe
for
you
i
do
think
it
is
respectable
people
might
think
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
i
wonder
if
miss
wodehouse
has
ever
seen
him
a
great
man
with
a
beard
to
be
sure
a
man
might
have
a
beard
and
yet
be
respectable
but
i
am
sure
if
miss
wodehouse
saw
him
she
would
agree
with
me
in
thinking
frank
my
dear
boy
what
is
the
matter
have
i
said
anything
wrong
nothing
that
i
know
of
said
the
curate
who
had
given
her
arm
a
little
angry
pressure
to
stop
the
stream
of
utterance
only
that
i
am
not
interested
in
the
other
lodger
tell
me
about
your
going
away
but
i
must
appeal
to
miss
wodehouse
it
is
for
your
own
sake
my
dear
frank
said
aunt
dora
a
clergyman
should
be
so
careful
i
know
what
your
aunt
leonora
would
say
do
you
think
to
see
a
man
like
that
coming
out
of
mr
wentworth
house
is
not
as
it
should
be
i
assure
you
he
frightened
me
i
do
think
i
have
seen
him
said
lucy
but
should
a
house
be
like
the
church
open
to
good
and
bad
for
it
is
to
the
wicked
and
the
miserable
you
are
sent
said
the
sister
of
mercy
lowering
her
voice
and
glancing
up
at
the
perpetual
curate
they
could
have
clasped
each
other
hands
at
that
moment
almost
without
being
aware
that
it
was
any
personal
feeling
which
made
their
agreement
so
sweet
as
for
miss
dora
she
went
on
leaning
on
her
nephew
arm
totally
unconscious
of
the
suppressed
rapture
and
elevation
in
which
the
two
were
moving
at
the
other
side
that
is
very
true
i
am
sure
your
aunt
leonora
would
approve
of
that
dear
said
miss
dora
with
a
little
answering
pressure
on
her
nephew
arm
but
still
i
have
a
feeling
that
a
clergyman
should
always
take
care
to
be
respectable
not
that
he
should
neglect
the
wicked
continued
the
poor
aunt
apologetically
for
a
poor
sinner
turning
from
the
evil
of
his
ways
is
the
the
most
interesting
sight
in
the
world
even
to
the
angels
you
know
but
to
with
them
in
the
same
house
my
dear
i
am
sure
that
is
what
i
never
could
advise
nor
leonora
either
and
mrs
hadwin
ought
to
know
better
and
have
him
away
do
you
know
who
he
is
frank
i
could
not
be
content
without
finding
out
if
it
was
me
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
said
the
curate
hurriedly
it
is
a
subject
i
do
want
to
discuss
never
mind
him
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
you
are
not
going
away
my
dear
leonora
has
been
thinking
it
all
over
said
miss
dora
and
we
are
so
anxious
about
you
leonora
is
very
fond
of
you
though
she
does
not
show
it
and
you
know
the
meritons
have
just
come
home
from
india
and
have
not
a
house
to
go
to
so
you
see
we
thought
as
you
are
not
quite
so
comfortable
as
we
could
wish
to
see
you
frank
and
perhaps
we
might
be
of
some
use
and
mr
shirley
is
better
again
and
no
immediate
settlement
has
to
be
made
about
skelmersdale
that
on
the
whole
if
leonora
and
you
were
to
see
more
of
each
other
oh
my
dear
boy
do
be
so
hasty
it
was
all
her
own
doing
it
was
not
my
fault
fault
i
am
sorry
to
be
the
occasion
of
so
many
arrangements
said
mr
wentworth
with
his
stiff
manner
but
of
course
if
you
like
to
stay
in
carlingford
i
shall
be
very
happy
though
there
is
not
much
preaching
here
that
will
suit
my
aunt
leonora
as
for
mr
shirley
i
hope
live
for
ever
i
was
at
no
today
continued
the
curate
turning
his
head
to
the
other
side
and
changing
his
tone
in
a
manner
marvellous
to
miss
dora
i
do
think
she
can
live
much
longer
you
have
done
a
great
deal
to
smooth
her
way
in
this
last
stage
poor
soul
she
thinks
she
has
been
a
great
sinner
said
the
young
man
with
a
kind
of
wondering
pity
he
had
a
great
deal
to
vex
him
in
his
own
person
and
he
knew
of
some
skeletons
very
near
at
hand
but
somehow
at
that
moment
it
was
hard
to
think
of
the
extremities
of
mortal
trouble
of
death
and
anguish
those
dark
deeps
of
life
by
which
lucy
and
he
sometimes
stood
together
in
their
youth
and
happiness
a
marvelling
remorseful
pity
came
to
his
heart
he
could
not
believe
in
misery
with
lucy
walking
softly
in
the
spring
twilight
by
his
side
but
frank
you
are
not
taking
any
notice
of
what
i
say
said
miss
dora
with
something
like
a
suppressed
sob
i
do
doubt
your
sick
people
are
very
important
but
i
thought
you
would
take
interest
i
came
down
to
tell
you
all
the
way
by
myself
my
sister
would
like
to
call
on
you
miss
wentworth
said
lucy
interposing
gentlemen
never
understand
what
one
says
perhaps
we
could
be
of
some
use
to
you
if
you
are
going
to
settle
in
carlingford
i
think
she
has
been
a
great
deal
better
since
she
confessed
continued
the
charitable
sister
looking
up
to
the
curate
and
like
him
dropping
her
voice
the
absolution
was
such
a
comfort
now
she
seems
to
feel
as
if
she
could
die
and
she
has
so
little
to
live
for
said
lucy
with
a
sigh
of
sympathetic
feeling
remorseful
too
somehow
it
seemed
cruel
to
feel
so
young
so
hopeful
so
capable
of
happiness
with
such
desolation
close
at
hand
not
even
duty
said
the
curate
and
to
think
that
the
church
should
hesitate
to
remove
the
last
barriers
out
of
the
way
i
would
not
be
a
priest
if
i
were
debarred
from
the
power
of
delivering
such
a
poor
soul
oh
frank
said
miss
dora
with
a
long
breath
of
fright
and
horror
are
you
saying
oh
my
dear
do
say
it
over
again
i
want
to
hear
it
i
hope
when
we
are
dying
we
shall
all
feel
what
great
great
sinners
we
are
said
the
poor
lady
who
between
vexation
and
mortification
was
ready
to
cry
and
not
think
that
one
is
better
than
another
oh
my
dear
there
is
that
man
again
do
you
think
it
is
safe
to
meet
him
in
such
a
lonely
road
if
he
comes
across
and
speaks
to
me
any
more
i
shall
faint
cried
poor
miss
dora
whose
opinions
were
not
quite
in
accordance
with
her
feelings
mr
wentworth
did
not
say
anything
to
soothe
her
but
with
his
unoccupied
hand
he
made
an
involuntary
movement
towards
lucy
cloak
and
plucked
at
it
to
bring
her
nearer
as
the
bearded
stranger
loomed
dimly
past
looking
at
the
group
lucy
felt
the
touch
and
wondered
and
looked
up
at
him
in
the
darkness
she
could
not
comprehend
the
curate
face
are
afraid
of
him
she
said
with
a
slight
smile
if
it
is
only
his
beard
i
am
not
alarmed
and
here
is
papa
coming
to
meet
me
i
thought
you
would
have
come
for
me
sooner
papa
has
anything
happened
said
lucy
taking
mr
wodehouse
arm
who
had
suddenly
appeared
from
underneath
the
lamp
still
unlighted
at
dr
marjoribanks
door
she
clung
to
her
father
with
unusual
eagerness
willing
enough
to
escape
from
the
darkness
and
the
curate
side
and
all
the
tremulous
sensations
of
the
hour
what
could
happen
said
mr
wodehouse
who
still
looked
limp
from
his
recent
illness
though
i
hear
there
are
doubtful
people
about
so
they
tell
me
but
you
ought
to
know
best
wentworth
who
is
that
fellow
in
the
beard
that
went
by
on
the
other
side
not
little
lake
the
fancied
i
had
seen
the
build
of
the
man
before
eh
a
stranger
well
it
a
mistake
perhaps
ca
be
sure
of
anything
nowadays
memory
failing
well
that
what
the
doctor
says
come
in
and
rest
and
see
molly
as
for
me
i
not
good
for
much
but
you
wo
get
better
company
than
the
girls
or
else
what
folks
tell
me
who
did
you
say
that
fellow
was
said
the
churchwarden
leaning
across
his
daughter
to
see
mr
wentworth
face
i
do
know
anything
about
him
said
the
curate
of
st
roque
and
curiously
enough
silence
fell
upon
the
little
party
nobody
could
tell
how
for
two
minutes
which
looked
like
twenty
no
one
spoke
then
lucy
roused
herself
apparently
with
a
little
effort
we
seem
to
talk
of
nothing
but
the
man
with
the
beard
she
said
mary
knows
everything
that
goes
on
in
carlingford
she
will
tell
us
about
him
and
if
miss
wentworth
thinks
it
too
late
to
come
in
we
will
say
she
continued
with
a
little
decision
of
tone
which
was
not
incomprehensible
to
the
perpetual
curate
perhaps
she
was
a
little
provoked
and
troubled
in
her
own
person
to
say
so
much
in
looks
and
so
little
in
words
was
a
mode
of
procedure
which
puzzled
lucy
it
fretted
her
because
it
looked
unworthy
of
her
hero
she
withdrew
within
the
green
door
holding
her
father
arm
fast
and
talking
to
him
while
mr
wentworth
strained
his
ears
after
the
voice
which
he
thought
he
could
have
singled
out
from
a
thousand
voices
perhaps
lucy
talked
to
drown
her
thoughts
and
the
curate
went
away
dumb
and
abstracted
with
his
aunt
leaning
on
his
arm
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
he
could
not
be
interested
as
miss
dora
expected
him
to
be
in
the
miss
wentworths
plans
he
conducted
her
to
the
blue
boar
languidly
with
an
evident
indifference
to
the
fact
that
his
aunt
leonora
was
about
to
become
a
permanent
resident
in
carlingford
he
said
kindly
to
little
rosa
elsworthy
looking
out
with
bright
eyes
into
the
darkness
at
the
door
of
her
uncle
shop
but
he
said
little
to
miss
dora
who
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
him
and
swallowed
her
tears
as
quietly
as
possible
under
her
veil
when
he
had
deposited
his
aunt
safely
at
the
inn
the
perpetual
curate
hastened
down
grange
lane
at
a
great
pace
the
first
sound
he
heard
on
entering
mrs
hadwin
garden
was
the
clear
notes
of
the
stranger
whistle
among
the
trees
and
with
an
impatient
exclamation
mr
wentworth
sought
his
who
was
smoking
as
usual
pacing
up
and
down
a
shaded
walk
where
even
in
daylight
he
was
pretty
well
concealed
from
observation
the
curate
looked
as
if
he
had
a
little
discontent
and
repugnance
to
get
over
before
he
could
address
the
anonymous
individual
who
whistled
so
cheerily
under
the
trees
when
he
did
speak
it
was
an
embarrassed
and
not
very
intelligible
call
i
say
are
you
there
i
want
to
speak
to
you
said
mr
wentworth
yes
said
the
stranger
turning
sharply
round
i
am
here
a
dog
without
a
name
what
have
you
got
to
say
only
that
you
must
be
more
careful
said
mr
wentworth
again
with
a
little
stiffness
you
will
be
recognised
if
you
do
mind
i
have
just
been
asked
who
you
were
by
somebody
who
thought
he
had
seen
you
before
by
whom
well
by
mr
wodehouse
said
the
curate
i
may
as
well
tell
you
if
you
mean
to
keep
up
this
concealment
you
must
take
care
by
jove
said
the
stranger
and
then
he
whistled
a
few
bars
of
the
air
which
mr
wentworth
arrival
had
interrupted
what
is
a
fellow
to
do
he
said
after
an
interjection
i
sometimes
think
i
had
better
risk
it
all
eh
do
you
think
so
i
ca
shut
myself
up
for
ever
here
that
must
be
as
you
think
best
said
the
perpetual
curate
in
whom
there
appeared
no
movement
of
sympathy
and
he
said
no
more
though
the
doubtful
individual
by
his
side
lifted
an
undecided
look
to
his
face
and
once
more
murmured
in
perplexed
tones
a
troubled
exclamation
a
man
must
have
a
little
amusement
somehow
the
stranger
said
with
an
aggrieved
voice
and
then
abruptly
left
his
unsociable
companion
and
went
off
to
his
room
where
he
summoned
sarah
to
bring
lights
and
tried
to
talk
to
her
a
little
in
utter
dearth
of
society
mr
wentworth
stayed
behind
pacing
up
and
down
the
darkening
walk
the
curate
thoughts
were
far
from
satisfactory
there
was
not
much
comfort
anywhere
let
him
look
where
he
pleased
when
a
man
has
no
spot
in
all
his
horizon
on
which
his
eye
can
rest
with
comfort
there
is
something
more
discouraging
in
the
prospect
than
a
positive
calamity
he
could
not
take
refuge
even
in
the
imaginations
of
his
love
for
it
was
clear
enough
that
already
a
sentiment
of
surprise
had
risen
in
lucy
mind
and
her
tranquillity
was
shaken
and
perhaps
he
had
done
rashly
to
plunge
into
other
troubles
he
upon
whom
a
curious
committee
of
aunts
were
now
to
sit
he
went
in
to
write
his
sermon
far
from
being
so
assured
of
things
in
general
as
that
discourse
was
when
it
was
written
though
it
was
a
little
relief
to
his
mind
to
fall
back
upon
an
authority
somewhere
and
to
refer
in
terms
which
were
perhaps
too
absolute
to
be
altogether
free
of
doubt
to
the
church
which
had
arranged
everything
for
her
children
in
one
department
of
their
concerns
at
least
if
it
were
only
as
easy
to
know
what
ought
to
be
done
in
one
personal
affairs
as
to
decide
what
was
the
due
state
of
mind
expected
by
the
church
on
the
second
sunday
after
easter
but
being
under
that
guidance
at
least
he
could
not
go
wrong
in
his
sermon
which
was
one
point
of
ease
amid
the
many
tribulations
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
chapter
ix
if
they
are
going
to
stay
in
carlingford
perhaps
we
could
be
of
use
to
them
yes
lucy
and
i
am
sure
anything
we
could
do
for
mr
wentworth
said
miss
wodehouse
i
wonder
what
house
they
will
get
i
am
going
to
elsworthy
about
some
paper
and
we
can
ask
him
if
he
knows
where
they
are
going
that
poor
little
rosa
should
have
some
one
to
take
care
of
her
i
often
wonder
whether
it
would
be
kind
to
speak
to
mrs
elsworthy
about
it
lucy
she
is
a
sensible
woman
the
little
thing
stands
at
the
door
in
the
evening
and
talks
to
people
who
are
passing
and
i
am
afraid
there
are
some
people
who
are
unprincipled
and
tell
her
she
is
pretty
and
say
things
to
her
said
miss
wodehouse
shaking
her
head
it
is
a
great
pity
even
mr
wentworth
is
a
great
deal
more
civil
to
that
little
thing
than
he
would
be
if
she
had
not
such
a
pretty
face
i
said
you
knew
everything
that
went
on
in
carlingford
said
lucy
as
they
went
out
together
from
the
green
door
not
in
their
grey
cloaks
this
time
but
i
forgot
to
ask
you
about
one
thing
that
puzzled
us
last
night
who
is
the
man
in
the
beard
who
lives
at
mrs
hadwin
mr
wentworth
will
not
tell
anybody
about
him
and
i
think
he
knows
who
is
the
man
in
the
beard
said
miss
wodehouse
with
a
gasp
she
grew
very
pale
and
turned
away
her
head
and
shivered
visibly
how
very
cold
it
is
she
said
with
her
teeth
chattering
did
you
think
it
was
so
cold
i
i
do
know
any
men
with
beards
and
it
is
so
strange
of
you
to
say
i
know
everything
that
goes
on
in
carlingford
do
stop
to
speak
to
that
little
girl
just
now
did
you
say
she
came
from
prickett
lane
no
it
is
very
right
to
go
to
see
the
sick
but
indeed
i
do
approve
of
your
attendance
upon
that
poor
woman
lucy
when
i
was
a
girl
i
dared
not
have
gone
away
by
myself
as
you
do
and
she
might
not
be
a
proper
person
there
is
a
carriage
that
i
do
know
standing
before
elsworthy
shop
but
you
have
not
told
me
yet
about
the
man
with
the
beard
said
lucy
whose
curiosity
was
excited
she
looked
at
her
sister
keenly
with
an
investigating
look
and
poor
miss
wodehouse
was
fain
to
draw
her
shawl
close
round
her
and
complain
again
of
the
cold
i
told
you
i
did
not
know
she
said
with
a
complaining
tone
in
her
voice
it
is
strange
you
should
think
i
knew
it
looks
as
if
you
thought
me
a
gossip
lucy
i
wonder
who
those
people
can
be
coming
out
of
the
carriage
my
dear
said
the
elder
sister
feeling
within
herself
that
an
attack
upon
the
enemy
country
was
the
best
means
of
meeting
any
sally
i
do
think
you
should
go
down
to
lane
just
now
i
saw
mr
wentworth
pass
a
little
while
ago
and
people
might
say
you
went
to
meet
each
other
i
ca
keep
people
from
talking
lucy
and
you
are
both
so
young
and
you
know
i
spoke
to
you
before
about
your
meeting
so
often
it
will
be
a
great
deal
better
for
you
to
come
with
me
to
call
on
his
aunts
only
that
my
poor
patient
wants
me
said
lucy
must
i
not
do
my
duty
to
a
poor
woman
who
is
dying
because
mr
wentworth
is
in
prickett
lane
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
be
afraid
of
meeting
mr
wentworth
said
the
young
severely
and
the
elder
sister
saw
that
lucy
spoke
in
a
different
tone
from
that
in
which
she
had
answered
her
before
she
did
not
extinguish
miss
wodehouse
by
a
reference
to
the
great
work
she
treated
the
matter
more
as
a
personal
one
and
a
shadow
a
very
ghost
of
irritation
was
in
lucy
voice
the
two
crossed
the
street
silently
after
that
to
elsworthy
where
a
group
of
ladies
were
visible
who
had
come
out
of
the
strange
carriage
one
of
them
was
seated
in
a
chair
by
the
counter
another
was
reading
a
list
which
mr
elsworthy
had
just
presented
to
her
and
the
third
who
was
not
so
tall
as
her
sister
was
pressing
up
to
it
on
tiptoe
trying
to
read
it
too
that
is
miss
dora
wentworth
said
lucy
and
the
other
i
suppose
is
miss
leonora
who
is
so
very
i
think
i
can
see
the
miss
hemmings
coming
down
george
street
if
i
were
to
go
in
i
should
be
in
a
dreadful
minority
but
you
are
in
your
heart
too
no
dear
only
reasonable
said
miss
wodehouse
apologetically
i
do
go
as
far
as
you
and
mr
wentworth
do
but
i
like
the
service
to
be
nicely
done
and
the
the
authority
of
the
church
respected
too
as
i
have
never
met
miss
wentworth
you
had
better
come
in
and
introduce
me
there
is
rosa
looking
out
of
the
front
window
lucy
i
really
must
speak
to
mrs
elsworthy
about
that
child
what
a
lovely
old
lady
that
is
sitting
by
the
counter
say
i
am
your
sister
and
then
if
you
are
resolved
upon
prickett
lane
you
can
go
away
they
are
the
two
who
wear
the
grey
cloaks
said
miss
leonora
wentworth
to
herself
as
the
introduction
was
effected
i
am
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
miss
wodehouse
we
are
going
to
stay
in
carlingford
for
a
time
and
to
know
a
few
pious
families
will
be
a
great
advantage
we
do
go
much
into
society
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
but
i
am
sure
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
ladies
who
help
my
nephew
so
much
in
his
work
is
sure
to
be
an
advantage
i
should
like
so
much
to
hear
from
you
how
he
gets
on
for
he
does
not
say
a
great
deal
about
it
himself
he
is
so
good
and
so
nice
said
kind
miss
wodehouse
he
never
makes
a
fuss
about
anything
he
does
i
am
sure
to
see
such
young
creatures
so
pious
and
so
devoted
always
goes
to
my
heart
when
we
were
young
it
used
to
be
so
different
we
took
our
own
pleasure
and
never
thought
of
our
and
the
young
people
are
so
good
nowadays
said
the
gentle
woman
falling
instinctively
into
her
favourite
sentiment
miss
leonora
looked
at
her
with
critical
eyes
we
are
none
of
us
good
said
that
woman
whose
neutral
tints
were
so
different
from
the
soft
of
her
new
acquaintance
it
does
not
become
such
sinful
creatures
to
talk
of
anybody
being
good
good
works
may
only
be
beautiful
sins
if
they
are
not
done
in
a
true
spirit
said
miss
leonora
turning
to
her
list
of
furnished
houses
with
a
little
contempt
but
the
miss
hemmings
had
come
in
while
she
was
speaking
and
it
was
seldom
that
such
edifying
talk
was
heard
in
carlingford
that
is
such
a
beautiful
sentiment
oh
if
we
only
bore
it
always
in
mind
murmured
the
eldest
miss
hemmings
mr
elsworthy
i
hope
you
have
got
the
tracts
i
ordered
they
are
so
much
wanted
here
poor
dear
mr
bury
would
not
believe
his
eyes
if
he
could
see
carlingford
now
given
up
to
puseyism
and
ritualism
but
good
men
are
taken
away
from
the
evil
to
come
i
will
pay
for
them
now
please
if
you
wish
it
said
mr
elsworthy
the
town
changed
i
do
say
nothing
different
but
being
in
the
ritual
line
as
you
say
you
wo
find
no
church
as
it
better
done
than
in
st
roque
mr
wentworth
never
spares
no
pains
on
anything
as
he
takes
up
i
heard
a
deal
of
clergymen
in
my
day
but
reading
is
beautiful
i
ca
say
as
i
ever
heard
reading
as
could
equal
it
and
them
choristers
though
they
hawful
to
manage
is
trained
as
i
never
see
boys
trained
in
life
afore
there
one
of
them
houses
continued
the
optimist
turning
to
miss
wentworth
as
is
a
beauty
miss
wodehouse
can
tell
you
what
it
is
no
lady
in
the
land
could
desire
a
handsomer
and
as
for
the
kitchings
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
judge
but
being
brought
up
a
blacksmith
i
know
what
what
in
a
if
you
had
all
grange
lane
to
dinner
there
a
range
as
is
equal
to
it
said
mr
elsworthy
with
enthusiasm
and
my
wife
will
show
you
the
i
knew
mr
bury
said
miss
leonora
he
was
a
precious
man
perhaps
you
have
heard
him
mention
the
miss
wentworths
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
that
there
is
no
real
work
going
on
in
the
town
it
is
very
sad
that
there
should
be
nobody
able
to
enter
into
the
labours
of
such
a
saint
indeed
said
miss
wodehouse
who
was
excited
in
spite
of
herself
by
this
conversation
i
think
the
carlingford
people
go
quite
as
much
to
church
as
in
mr
bury
days
i
do
think
there
is
less
religion
than
there
used
to
be
there
are
not
so
many
prayer
meetings
perhaps
but
there
is
nothing
the
carnal
mind
dislikes
so
much
as
prayer
meetings
said
miss
hemmings
there
is
a
house
in
grove
street
if
miss
wentworth
is
looking
for
a
house
i
do
know
much
about
the
but
i
know
it
belongs
to
a
very
pious
family
and
they
wish
so
much
to
let
it
my
sister
and
i
would
be
so
glad
to
take
you
there
it
is
not
in
the
gay
world
like
grange
lane
but
you
might
want
to
ask
people
to
dinner
and
then
we
should
be
so
near
frank
said
miss
dora
whispering
at
her
sister
elbow
as
for
the
second
miss
hemmings
she
was
dull
of
comprehension
and
did
not
quite
make
out
who
the
strangers
were
it
is
so
sad
to
a
feeling
mind
to
see
the
mummeries
that
go
on
at
st
roque
said
this
obtuse
sister
and
i
am
afraid
poor
mr
wentworth
must
be
in
a
bad
way
they
say
there
is
the
strangest
man
in
his
house
some
relation
of
his
and
he
dare
be
seen
in
the
daylight
and
people
begin
to
think
there
must
be
something
wrong
and
that
mr
wentworth
himself
is
involved
but
what
can
you
expect
when
there
is
no
true
christian
principle
asked
miss
hemmings
triumphantly
it
was
a
dreadful
moment
for
the
bystanders
for
miss
leonora
turned
round
upon
this
new
intelligence
with
keen
eyes
and
attention
and
miss
dora
interposed
weeping
and
miss
wodehouse
grew
so
pale
that
mr
elsworthy
rushed
for
cold
water
and
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
tell
me
all
about
this
said
miss
leonora
with
peremptory
and
commanding
tones
oh
leonora
i
am
sure
my
dear
frank
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
there
is
anything
wrong
cried
miss
dora
even
miss
wentworth
herself
was
moved
out
of
her
habitual
smile
she
said
he
is
my
nephew
an
observation
which
she
had
never
been
heard
to
make
before
and
which
covered
the
second
miss
hemmings
with
confusion
as
for
miss
wodehouse
she
retreated
very
fast
to
a
seat
behind
miss
cecilia
and
said
nothing
the
two
who
had
arrived
last
slunk
back
upon
each
other
with
fiery
glances
of
mutual
reproach
the
former
three
stood
together
in
this
emergency
full
of
curiosity
and
perhaps
a
little
anxiety
in
this
position
of
affairs
mr
elsworthy
being
the
only
impartial
person
present
took
the
management
of
matters
into
his
own
hands
miss
hemmings
and
ladies
if
you
allow
said
mr
elsworthy
it
aint
no
more
than
a
mistake
the
new
gentleman
as
is
staying
at
mrs
hadwin
may
be
an
unfortunate
gentleman
for
anything
i
can
tell
but
he
aint
no
relation
of
our
clergyman
there
aint
nobody
belonging
to
mr
wentworth
said
the
clerk
of
st
roque
but
is
a
credit
both
to
him
and
to
carlingford
there
his
brother
the
rev
mr
wentworth
as
is
the
man
to
be
a
clergyman
as
i
ever
set
eyes
on
and
there
respected
ladies
as
need
be
named
more
particular
but
the
gentleman
as
is
the
subject
of
conversation
is
no
more
like
mr
wentworth
than
asking
pardon
for
the
liberty
i
am
i
may
say
as
i
have
opportunities
for
knowing
more
than
most
said
mr
elsworthy
modestly
me
and
rosa
for
if
there
a
thing
mr
wentworth
is
particular
about
it
having
his
papers
the
first
moment
and
ladies
as
knows
me
knows
i
am
one
that
never
says
more
nor
the
truth
not
saying
a
word
against
the
gentleman
as
is
a
most
respectable
gentleman
for
anything
i
know
against
him
he
aint
no
connection
of
mr
wentworth
he
mrs
hadwin
lodger
and
i
would
say
as
he
a
relation
there
but
our
clergyman
has
got
no
more
to
do
with
him
than
the
babe
unborn
mr
elsworthy
wiped
his
forehead
after
he
had
made
this
speech
and
looked
round
for
the
approbation
which
he
was
aware
he
had
deserved
and
miss
leonora
wentworth
threw
a
glance
of
disdainful
observation
upon
the
unhappy
lady
who
had
caused
this
disturbance
if
your
wife
will
come
with
us
we
will
go
and
look
at
the
house
she
said
graciously
i
daresay
if
it
is
in
grange
lane
it
will
suit
us
very
well
my
nephew
is
a
very
young
man
miss
wodehouse
said
miss
leonora
who
had
not
passed
over
the
agitation
of
that
gentle
woman
without
some
secret
comments
he
does
not
take
advice
in
his
work
though
it
might
be
of
great
assistance
to
him
but
i
hope
he
grow
older
and
wiser
as
indeed
he
can
not
help
doing
if
he
lives
i
hope
you
and
your
pretty
sister
will
come
to
see
us
when
we
settled
i
do
see
any
sense
you
know
in
your
grey
cloaks
i
old
and
you
wo
mind
me
saying
so
but
i
know
what
frank
wentworth
is
said
the
indignant
aunt
making
a
severe
curtsy
accompanied
by
lightning
glances
at
the
shrinking
background
of
female
figures
as
she
went
out
of
the
shop
oh
leonora
i
always
said
you
were
fond
of
him
though
you
never
would
show
it
cried
poor
miss
dora
she
is
a
great
deal
more
affectionate
than
she
will
let
anybody
believe
and
my
dear
frank
means
nothing
but
good
cried
the
too
zealous
champion
miss
leonora
turned
back
upon
the
threshold
of
the
shop
you
will
please
to
let
me
know
what
dissenting
chapels
there
are
in
the
town
and
what
are
the
hours
of
the
services
she
said
there
must
surely
be
a
bethesda
or
zion
or
something
salem
yes
to
be
sure
perhaps
there
somebody
there
that
preaches
the
gospel
send
me
word
said
the
peremptory
woman
and
poor
miss
dora
relapsed
into
her
usual
melancholy
condition
and
stole
into
the
carriage
in
a
manner
weeping
under
her
veil
after
which
miss
wodehouse
went
home
not
having
much
heart
for
further
visits
that
is
to
say
she
went
all
the
way
down
grange
lane
somewhat
tremulous
and
uncertain
in
her
steps
and
went
as
far
as
mrs
hadwin
and
hesitated
at
the
door
as
if
she
meant
to
call
there
but
thinking
better
of
it
went
on
a
little
farther
with
very
lingering
steps
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
when
she
came
back
again
the
door
of
mrs
hadwin
garden
was
open
and
the
butcher
boy
stood
blocking
up
the
way
listening
with
all
his
ears
to
the
notes
of
the
whistle
soft
and
high
and
clear
like
the
notes
of
a
bird
which
come
audibly
from
among
the
trees
miss
wodehouse
gave
a
little
start
when
she
heard
it
again
she
hesitated
and
looked
in
with
such
a
wistful
face
that
sarah
the
housemaid
who
had
been
about
to
slam
the
door
hastily
upon
the
too
tender
butcher
involuntarily
held
it
wide
open
for
the
expected
visitor
no
not
thank
you
said
miss
wodehouse
i
hope
your
mistress
is
quite
well
give
her
my
love
and
say
i
meant
to
come
in
but
i
have
a
bad
headache
no
thank
you
not
she
went
away
after
that
with
a
wonderful
expression
of
face
and
reached
home
long
before
lucy
had
come
back
from
prickett
lane
miss
wodehouse
was
not
good
for
much
in
the
house
she
went
to
the
little
boudoir
and
lay
down
on
the
sofa
and
had
some
tea
brought
her
by
an
anxious
maid
she
was
very
nervous
trembling
she
could
not
say
why
and
took
up
a
novel
which
was
lying
on
the
sofa
and
read
the
most
affecting
scene
and
cried
over
it
and
then
her
sweet
old
face
cleared
and
she
felt
better
when
lucy
came
in
she
kissed
her
sister
and
drew
down
the
blinds
and
brought
her
the
third
volume
and
then
went
away
herself
to
arrange
the
dessert
and
see
that
everything
was
in
order
for
one
of
mr
wodehouse
little
parties
these
were
their
respective
parts
in
the
house
and
surely
a
more
peaceful
and
orderly
and
affectionate
house
was
not
to
be
found
that
spring
evening
either
in
england
or
grange
lane
chapter
x
it
may
be
easily
supposed
after
this
that
mr
wentworth
and
his
proceedings
were
sufficiently
overlooked
and
commented
upon
in
carlingford
the
miss
wentworths
took
old
major
brown
house
for
six
months
which
as
everybody
knows
is
next
door
to
dr
marjoribanks
it
was
just
after
letty
brown
marriage
and
the
poor
old
major
was
very
glad
to
go
away
and
pay
a
round
of
visits
and
try
to
forget
that
his
last
daughter
had
gone
the
way
of
all
the
rest
there
was
a
built
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
with
a
window
in
the
outer
wall
looking
on
to
grange
lane
from
which
everything
that
happened
could
be
inspected
and
there
was
always
somebody
at
that
window
when
the
perpetual
curate
passed
by
then
he
began
to
have
a
strange
painful
feeling
that
lucy
watched
too
and
was
observing
all
his
looks
and
ways
and
what
he
did
and
said
in
these
changed
times
it
was
a
strange
difference
from
the
sweet
bond
between
them
which
existed
of
old
when
they
walked
home
together
from
wharfside
talking
of
the
district
and
the
people
in
the
tender
union
of
unspoken
love
and
fellowship
not
that
they
were
altogether
parted
now
but
lucy
contrived
to
leave
the
schoolroom
most
days
before
the
young
priest
could
manage
to
disrobe
himself
and
was
seldom
to
be
seen
on
the
road
lingering
on
her
errands
of
kindness
as
she
used
to
do
but
still
she
knew
all
he
was
about
and
watched
standing
in
doubt
and
wonder
of
him
which
was
at
least
a
great
deal
better
than
indifference
on
the
whole
however
it
was
a
cloudy
world
through
which
the
perpetual
curate
passed
as
he
went
from
his
lodgings
where
the
whistle
of
the
new
lodger
had
become
a
great
nuisance
to
him
past
the
long
range
of
the
sentinel
window
where
miss
dora
looked
out
watching
for
him
and
mr
wodehouse
green
door
which
he
no
longer
entered
every
day
over
the
young
man
mind
as
he
went
out
to
his
labours
there
used
to
come
that
sensation
of
having
nobody
to
fall
back
upon
which
is
of
all
feelings
the
most
desolate
amid
all
those
people
who
were
watching
him
there
was
no
one
upon
whom
he
could
rest
secure
of
understanding
and
sympathy
they
were
all
critical
examining
with
more
or
less
comprehension
what
he
did
and
he
could
not
think
of
anybody
in
the
world
just
then
who
would
be
content
with
knowing
that
did
it
and
take
that
as
warranty
for
the
act
unless
perhaps
his
poor
aunt
dora
whose
opinion
was
not
important
to
the
young
man
it
was
not
a
pleasant
state
of
mind
into
which
these
feelings
threw
him
and
the
natural
result
was
that
he
grew
more
and
more
careful
about
the
rubric
and
confined
his
sermons
with
increasing
precision
to
the
beautiful
arrangements
of
the
church
they
were
very
clever
little
sermons
even
within
these
limitations
and
an
indifferent
spectator
would
probably
have
been
surprised
to
find
how
much
he
could
make
out
of
them
but
still
it
is
undeniable
that
a
man
has
less
scope
not
only
for
oratory
but
for
all
that
is
worthy
of
regard
in
human
speech
when
instead
of
the
reciprocations
between
heaven
and
earth
he
occupies
himself
only
with
a
set
of
ecclesiastical
arrangements
however
perfect
the
people
who
went
to
st
roque
found
this
out
and
so
did
mr
wentworth
but
it
did
not
alter
the
system
pursued
by
the
troubled
curate
perhaps
he
gave
himself
some
credit
for
it
as
being
against
his
own
interests
for
there
was
no
mistaking
the
countenance
of
miss
leonora
when
now
and
then
on
rare
occasions
she
came
to
hear
her
nephew
preach
all
this
however
was
confined
to
st
roque
where
there
was
a
somewhat
select
audience
people
who
agreed
in
mr
wentworth
views
but
things
were
entirely
different
at
wharfside
where
the
perpetual
curate
was
not
thinking
about
himself
but
simply
about
his
work
and
how
to
do
it
best
the
bargemen
and
their
wives
did
not
know
much
about
the
christian
year
but
they
understood
the
greater
matters
which
lay
beneath
and
the
women
said
to
each
other
sometimes
with
tears
in
their
eyes
that
there
was
nothing
that
the
clergyman
make
plain
and
that
if
the
men
did
do
what
was
right
it
was
none
o
mr
wentworth
fault
the
young
priest
indemnified
himself
in
the
district
for
much
that
vexed
him
elsewhere
there
was
no
question
of
skelmersdale
or
of
any
moot
point
there
but
only
a
quantity
of
primitive
people
under
the
original
conditions
of
humanity
whose
lives
might
be
amended
and
consoled
and
elevated
that
was
a
matter
about
which
mr
wentworth
had
no
doubt
he
put
on
his
surplice
with
the
conviction
that
in
that
white
ephod
the
truest
embodiment
of
christian
purity
was
brought
within
sight
of
the
darkened
world
he
was
not
himself
but
a
christian
priest
with
power
to
deliver
and
to
bless
when
he
went
to
wharfside
easter
had
been
early
that
year
and
ascension
day
was
in
the
beginning
of
may
one
of
those
sweet
days
of
early
summer
which
still
occur
now
and
then
to
prove
that
the
poets
were
right
in
all
they
say
of
the
tenderest
month
of
the
year
mr
wentworth
had
done
duty
at
st
roque
and
afterwards
at
wharfside
the
sweet
day
and
the
sweet
season
had
moved
his
heart
he
was
young
and
it
was
hard
to
live
shut
up
within
himself
without
any
sympathy
either
from
man
or
woman
he
had
watched
the
grey
cloak
gliding
out
as
his
rude
congregation
dispersed
and
went
away
quicker
than
was
his
wont
with
a
stronger
longing
than
usual
to
overtake
lucy
and
recover
his
place
beside
her
but
she
was
not
to
be
seen
when
he
got
into
prickett
lane
he
looked
up
the
weary
length
of
the
street
and
saw
nothing
but
the
children
playing
on
the
pavement
and
some
slovenly
mothers
at
the
doors
it
was
a
very
disenchanting
prospect
he
went
on
again
in
a
kind
of
gloomy
discontent
displeased
with
everything
what
was
the
good
of
it
all
he
said
to
himself
weariness
and
toil
and
trouble
and
nothing
ever
to
come
of
it
as
for
the
little
good
he
was
doing
in
wharfside
god
did
not
need
his
poor
exertions
and
to
tell
the
truth
going
on
at
st
roque
however
perfect
the
rubric
and
pretty
the
church
was
without
any
personal
stimulant
of
happiness
no
great
prospect
for
the
perpetual
curate
such
was
the
tenor
of
his
thoughts
when
he
saw
a
black
figure
suddenly
emerge
out
of
one
of
the
houses
and
stand
at
the
door
throwing
a
long
shadow
over
the
pavement
it
was
the
rector
who
was
standing
there
in
mr
wentworth
favourite
district
talking
to
a
shopkeeper
who
had
always
been
on
the
opposition
side
the
young
anglican
raised
his
drooping
head
instantly
and
recovered
his
interest
in
the
general
world
glad
to
see
you
mr
wentworth
said
the
rector
i
have
been
speaking
to
this
worthy
man
about
the
necessities
of
the
district
the
statistics
are
far
from
being
satisfactory
five
thousand
souls
and
no
provision
for
their
spiritual
wants
it
is
a
very
sad
state
of
affairs
i
mean
to
take
steps
immediately
to
remedy
all
that
a
bit
of
a
methody
chapel
that
all
said
the
opposition
shopkeeper
and
the
schoolroom
as
mr
wentworth
yes
i
have
heard
of
that
said
the
rector
blandly
somebody
had
advised
mr
morgan
to
change
his
tactics
and
this
was
the
first
evidence
of
the
new
policy
i
hear
you
have
been
doing
what
little
you
could
to
mend
matters
it
is
very
laudable
zeal
in
so
young
a
man
but
of
course
as
you
were
without
authority
and
had
so
little
in
your
power
it
could
only
be
a
very
temporary
expedient
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
good
intentions
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
perpetual
curate
rousing
up
as
at
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
i
do
care
in
the
least
about
my
good
intentions
but
you
have
been
much
deceived
if
you
have
not
understood
that
there
is
a
great
work
going
on
in
wharfside
i
hope
saunders
you
have
had
no
hand
in
deceiving
mr
morgan
i
shall
be
glad
to
show
you
my
statistics
which
are
more
satisfactory
than
the
town
list
said
mr
wentworth
the
schoolroom
is
consecrated
and
but
that
i
thought
we
had
better
work
slowly
and
steadily
there
is
many
a
district
in
worse
condition
which
has
its
church
and
its
incumbent
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
give
you
all
possible
information
it
is
best
to
go
to
the
fountainhead
the
fountainhead
said
the
rector
who
began
not
unnaturally
to
lose
his
temper
are
you
aware
sir
that
wharfside
is
in
my
parish
and
so
is
st
roque
i
suppose
said
the
curate
affably
i
have
no
district
but
i
have
my
cure
of
souls
all
the
same
as
for
wharfside
the
rector
of
carlingford
never
had
had
anything
to
do
with
it
mr
bury
and
mr
proctor
made
it
over
to
me
i
act
upon
their
authority
but
i
should
like
to
prove
to
you
it
is
something
more
than
a
temporary
expedient
said
the
young
anglican
with
a
smile
mr
morgan
was
gradually
getting
very
hot
and
flushed
his
temper
got
the
better
of
him
he
could
not
tolerate
to
be
thus
bearded
on
his
own
ground
it
appears
to
me
the
most
extraordinary
assumption
said
the
rector
i
ca
fancy
that
you
are
ignorant
of
the
law
i
repeat
wharfside
is
in
my
parish
and
on
what
ground
you
can
possibly
justify
such
an
incredible
intrusion
perhaps
we
might
find
a
fitter
place
to
discuss
the
matter
said
the
curate
with
great
suavity
if
you
care
to
go
to
the
schoolroom
we
could
be
quiet
there
no
sir
i
do
care
to
go
to
the
schoolroom
i
decline
to
have
anything
to
do
with
such
an
unwarrantable
attempt
to
interfere
with
my
rights
said
mr
morgan
i
do
want
to
know
what
plausible
arguments
you
may
have
to
justify
yourself
the
fact
remains
sir
that
wharfside
is
in
my
parish
if
you
have
anything
to
say
against
that
i
will
listen
to
you
said
the
irascible
rector
his
welsh
blood
was
up
he
even
raised
his
voice
a
little
with
a
kind
of
excitement
common
to
the
celtic
race
and
the
consequence
was
that
mr
wentworth
who
stood
perfectly
calm
to
receive
the
storm
had
all
the
advantage
in
the
world
over
mr
morgan
the
perpetual
curate
bowed
with
immovable
composure
and
felt
himself
master
of
the
field
in
that
case
it
will
perhaps
be
better
not
to
say
anything
he
said
but
i
think
you
will
find
difficulties
in
the
way
wharfside
has
some
curious
privileges
and
pays
no
rates
but
i
have
never
taken
up
that
ground
the
two
previous
rectors
made
it
over
to
me
and
the
work
is
too
important
to
be
ignored
i
have
had
thoughts
of
applying
to
have
it
made
into
an
ecclesiastical
district
said
the
curate
with
candour
not
thinking
that
the
rector
of
carlingford
with
so
much
to
occupy
him
would
care
to
interfere
with
my
labours
but
at
all
events
to
begin
another
mission
here
would
be
folly
it
would
be
copying
the
tactics
of
the
dissenters
if
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
so
said
mr
wentworth
looking
calmly
in
the
rector
face
it
was
all
mr
morgan
could
do
to
restrain
himself
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
being
schooled
by
my
juniors
said
the
rector
with
suppressed
fury
he
meant
to
say
inferiors
but
the
aspect
of
the
perpetual
curate
checked
him
then
the
two
stood
gazing
at
each
other
for
a
minute
in
silence
anything
further
you
may
have
to
say
you
will
perhaps
communicate
to
my
solicitor
said
the
elder
priest
it
is
well
known
that
some
gentlemen
of
your
views
mr
wentworth
think
it
safe
to
do
evil
that
good
may
come
that
is
not
my
opinion
and
i
do
mean
to
permit
any
invasion
of
my
rights
i
have
the
pleasure
of
wishing
you
good
morning
mr
morgan
took
off
his
hat
and
gave
it
a
little
angry
flourish
in
the
air
before
he
put
it
on
again
he
had
challenged
his
young
brother
to
the
only
duel
permitted
by
their
cloth
and
he
turned
to
the
opposition
tradesman
with
vehemence
and
went
in
again
to
the
dusty
little
shop
where
a
humble
assortment
of
groceries
were
displayed
for
the
consumption
of
prickett
lane
mr
wentworth
remained
standing
outside
in
much
amazement
not
to
say
amusement
and
a
general
sense
of
awakening
and
recovery
next
to
happiness
perhaps
enmity
is
the
most
healthful
stimulant
of
the
human
mind
the
perpetual
curate
woke
up
and
realised
his
position
with
a
sense
of
exhilaration
if
the
truth
must
be
told
he
muttered
something
to
himself
uncomplimentary
to
mr
morgan
good
sense
as
he
turned
away
but
it
was
astonishing
to
find
how
much
more
lively
and
interesting
prickett
lane
had
become
since
that
encounter
he
went
along
cheerily
saying
a
word
now
and
then
to
the
people
at
the
doors
every
one
of
whom
knew
and
recognised
him
and
acknowledged
in
a
lesser
or
greater
degree
the
sway
of
his
bishopric
the
groups
he
addressed
made
remarks
after
he
had
passed
which
showed
their
sense
of
the
improvement
in
his
looks
he
more
like
himsel
than
he
bin
sin
easter
said
one
woman
and
none
o
that
crossed
look
as
if
things
had
gone
contrairy
lord
bless
you
not
cross
he
a
deal
too
good
a
man
for
that
but
it
might
be
crossed
in
love
for
what
i
can
tell
them
as
is
handsome
like
that
seldom
gets
crossed
in
love
said
another
experienced
observer
but
if
it
was
fortin
or
whatever
it
was
there
a
one
in
wharfside
but
wishes
luck
to
the
parson
it
aint
much
matter
for
us
women
them
as
wo
strive
to
keep
their
children
decent
out
o
their
own
heads
they
wo
do
much
for
a
clergyman
but
bless
you
he
can
do
a
deal
with
the
men
and
them
as
wants
looking
after
i
like
to
go
to
his
wedding
said
another
i
give
a
deal
to
hear
it
was
all
settled
and
amid
these
affectionate
comments
mr
wentworth
issued
out
of
prickett
lane
he
went
direct
to
mr
wodehouse
green
door
without
making
any
excuses
to
himself
for
the
first
time
for
some
weeks
he
went
in
upon
the
sisters
and
told
them
all
that
had
happened
as
of
old
lucy
was
still
in
her
grey
cloak
as
she
had
returned
from
the
district
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
more
distinct
than
sympathy
that
she
heard
of
this
threatened
attack
it
is
terrible
to
think
that
he
could
interfere
with
such
a
work
out
of
jealousy
of
said
the
sister
of
charity
with
a
wonderful
light
in
her
blue
eyes
and
she
drew
her
low
chair
nearer
and
listened
with
eloquent
looks
which
were
balm
to
the
soul
of
the
perpetual
curate
but
we
are
not
to
give
up
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
when
he
rose
to
go
away
never
said
mr
wentworth
and
if
he
held
it
more
closely
and
longer
than
there
was
any
particular
occasion
for
lucy
did
not
make
any
objection
at
that
special
moment
then
it
turned
out
that
he
had
business
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
at
the
north
end
where
some
trustee
lived
who
had
to
do
with
the
orphan
schools
and
whom
the
curate
was
obliged
to
see
and
miss
wodehouse
gave
him
a
timid
invitation
to
come
back
to
dinner
but
you
are
not
to
go
home
to
dress
we
shall
be
quite
alone
and
you
must
be
so
tired
said
the
elder
sister
who
for
some
reason
or
other
was
shy
of
mr
wentworth
and
kept
away
from
him
whenever
he
called
so
he
went
in
on
his
way
back
and
dined
in
happiness
and
his
morning
coat
with
a
sweet
conscious
return
to
the
familiar
intercourse
which
these
few
disturbed
weeks
had
interrupted
he
was
a
different
man
when
he
went
back
again
down
grange
lane
once
more
the
darkness
was
fragrant
and
musical
about
him
when
he
was
tired
thinking
of
his
affairs
he
fell
back
upon
the
memories
of
the
evening
and
lucy
looks
and
the
us
and
we
which
were
so
sweet
to
his
ears
to
have
somebody
behind
whom
one
can
fall
back
upon
to
fill
up
the
interstices
of
thought
makes
all
the
difference
as
mr
wentworth
found
out
between
a
bright
and
a
heavy
life
when
he
opened
the
with
his
key
and
went
softly
in
in
the
darkness
the
perpetual
curate
was
much
surprised
to
hear
voices
among
the
trees
he
waited
a
little
wondering
to
see
who
it
was
and
profound
was
his
amazement
when
a
minute
after
little
rosa
elsworthy
hastily
tying
her
hat
over
her
curls
came
rapidly
along
the
walk
from
under
the
big
and
essayed
with
rather
a
tremulous
hand
to
open
the
door
mr
wentworth
stepped
forward
suddenly
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
he
was
very
angry
and
indignant
and
no
longer
the
benign
superior
being
to
whom
rosa
was
accustomed
whom
have
you
been
talking
to
said
the
curate
why
are
you
here
alone
so
late
what
does
this
mean
he
held
the
door
close
and
looked
down
upon
her
severely
while
he
spoke
she
made
a
frightened
attempt
to
defend
herself
oh
please
i
only
came
with
the
papers
i
was
talking
to
sarah
said
the
little
girl
with
a
sob
of
shame
and
terror
i
will
never
do
it
again
oh
please
let
me
go
please
mr
wentworth
let
me
go
how
long
have
you
been
talking
to
sarah
said
the
curate
did
you
ever
do
it
before
no
rosa
i
am
going
to
take
you
home
this
must
not
happen
any
more
i
will
run
all
the
way
oh
do
tell
my
aunt
mr
wentworth
i
mean
any
harm
said
the
frightened
creature
you
are
not
really
coming
oh
mr
wentworth
if
you
tell
my
aunt
i
shall
die
cried
poor
little
rosa
but
she
was
hushed
into
awe
and
silence
when
the
curate
stalked
forth
a
grand
figure
by
her
side
keeping
pace
with
her
hasty
tremulous
steps
she
even
stopped
crying
in
the
whirlwind
of
her
feelings
what
did
he
mean
was
he
going
to
say
anything
to
her
was
it
possible
that
he
could
like
her
and
be
jealous
of
her
talk
with
sarah
poor
little
foolish
rosa
did
not
know
what
to
think
she
had
read
a
great
many
novels
and
knew
that
it
was
quite
usual
for
gentlemen
to
fall
in
love
with
pretty
little
girls
who
were
not
of
their
own
station
why
not
with
her
so
she
went
on
half
running
keeping
up
with
mr
wentworth
and
sometimes
stealing
sly
glances
at
him
to
see
what
intention
was
in
his
looks
but
his
looks
were
beyond
rosa
reading
he
walked
by
her
side
without
speaking
and
gave
a
glance
up
at
the
window
of
the
as
they
passed
and
strange
enough
that
evening
of
all
others
miss
dora
who
had
been
the
victim
of
some
of
miss
leonora
caustic
criticisms
had
strayed
forth
in
melancholy
mood
to
repose
herself
at
her
favourite
window
and
look
out
at
the
faint
stars
and
comfort
herself
with
a
feeble
repetition
of
her
favourite
plea
that
it
was
not
my
fault
the
poor
lady
was
startled
out
of
her
own
troubles
by
the
sight
of
her
nephew
tall
unmistakable
figure
and
as
bad
luck
would
have
it
rosa
hat
tied
insecurely
by
her
agitated
fingers
blew
off
at
that
moment
so
that
mr
wentworth
aunt
became
aware
to
her
inexpressible
horror
and
astonishment
who
his
companion
was
the
unhappy
curate
divined
all
the
thoughts
that
would
arise
in
her
perturbed
bosom
when
he
saw
the
indistinct
figure
at
the
window
and
said
something
to
himself
about
which
was
barely
civil
to
miss
dora
as
he
hurried
along
on
his
charitable
errand
he
was
out
of
one
trouble
into
another
this
unlucky
young
man
he
knocked
sharply
at
elsworthy
closed
door
and
gave
up
his
charge
without
speaking
to
rosa
i
brought
her
home
because
i
thought
it
wrong
to
let
her
go
up
grange
lane
by
herself
said
the
curate
do
thank
me
but
if
you
have
any
regard
for
the
child
send
her
out
at
night
again
he
did
not
even
bid
rosa
or
look
back
at
her
as
she
stood
blushing
and
sparkling
in
confused
childish
beauty
in
the
doorway
but
turned
his
back
like
any
savage
and
hastened
home
again
before
he
entered
his
own
apartments
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
green
room
and
said
something
to
the
inmate
there
which
produced
from
that
personage
a
growl
of
restrained
defiance
and
after
all
these
fatigues
it
was
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
the
curate
threw
himself
upon
his
sofa
to
think
over
the
events
of
the
afternoon
and
to
take
a
little
rest
he
was
very
tired
and
the
consolation
he
had
experienced
during
the
evening
made
him
more
disposed
to
yield
to
his
fatigue
he
threw
himself
upon
the
sofa
and
stretched
out
his
hand
lazily
for
his
letters
which
evidently
did
not
excite
any
special
expectations
in
his
mind
there
was
one
from
his
sister
and
one
from
an
old
university
friend
full
of
the
news
of
the
season
last
of
all
there
was
a
neat
little
note
directed
in
a
neat
little
hand
which
anybody
who
received
it
would
naturally
have
left
to
the
last
as
mr
wentworth
did
he
opened
it
quite
deliberately
without
any
appearance
of
interest
but
as
he
read
the
first
lines
the
curate
gradually
gathered
himself
up
off
the
sofa
and
stretched
out
his
hand
for
his
boots
which
he
had
just
taken
off
and
before
he
had
finished
it
had
walked
across
the
room
and
laid
hold
of
the
railway
book
in
use
at
carlingford
all
the
time
reading
and
the
important
little
epistle
it
was
not
so
neat
inside
as
out
and
blurred
and
blotted
and
slightly
illegible
and
this
is
what
the
letter
said
oh
frank
dear
i
am
so
anxious
and
unhappy
about
gerald
i
tell
what
is
the
matter
with
him
come
directly
for
heaven
sake
and
tell
me
what
you
think
and
try
what
you
can
do
do
lose
a
train
after
you
get
this
but
come
directly
oh
come
if
you
ever
loved
any
of
us
i
do
know
what
he
means
but
he
says
the
most
awful
things
and
if
he
is
not
as
i
sometimes
hope
he
has
forgotten
his
duty
to
his
family
and
to
me
which
is
far
worse
i
ca
explain
more
but
if
there
is
any
chance
of
anybody
doing
him
good
it
is
you
i
beg
you
on
my
knees
come
directly
dear
frank
i
never
was
in
such
a
state
in
my
life
i
shall
be
left
so
that
nobody
will
be
able
to
tell
what
i
am
and
my
heart
is
bursting
never
mind
business
or
anything
but
come
come
directly
whether
it
is
night
or
day
to
your
sister
louisa
in
great
haste
and
anxious
to
see
you
half
an
hour
after
mr
wentworth
with
a
in
his
hand
was
once
more
hastening
up
grange
lane
towards
the
railway
station
his
face
was
somewhat
grey
as
the
lamps
shone
on
it
he
did
not
exactly
know
what
he
was
anxious
about
nor
what
might
have
happened
at
wentworth
rectory
before
he
could
get
there
but
the
express
train
felt
slow
to
his
anxious
thoughts
as
it
flashed
out
of
the
station
mr
morgan
and
his
wife
were
in
their
garden
talking
about
the
encounter
in
lane
when
the
train
plunged
past
waking
all
the
echoes
and
mrs
morgan
by
way
of
making
a
diversion
appealed
to
the
rector
about
those
creepers
with
which
she
hoped
in
a
year
or
two
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
the
railway
the
virginian
creeper
would
be
the
best
said
the
rector
wife
and
they
went
in
to
calculate
the
expenses
of
bringing
mr
wentworth
before
dr
lushington
miss
dora
at
very
nearly
the
same
moment
was
confiding
to
her
sister
cecilia
under
vows
of
secrecy
the
terrible
sight
she
had
seen
from
the
window
they
went
to
bed
with
very
sad
hearts
in
consequence
both
these
good
women
in
the
mean
time
leaving
all
these
gathering
clouds
behind
him
leaving
his
reputation
and
his
work
to
be
discussed
and
quarrelled
over
as
they
might
the
perpetual
curate
rushed
through
the
night
his
heart
aching
with
trouble
and
anxiety
to
help
if
he
could
and
if
not
at
least
to
stand
by
gerald
in
this
unknown
crisis
of
his
brother
life
chapter
xi
miss
dora
wentworth
rose
very
unrefreshed
next
morning
from
her
disturbed
slumbers
it
was
hard
to
sit
at
breakfast
with
leonora
and
not
betray
to
her
the
new
anxiety
and
the
troubled
sister
ran
into
a
countless
number
of
digressions
which
would
have
inevitably
betrayed
her
had
not
miss
leonora
been
at
the
moment
otherwise
occupied
she
had
her
little
budget
of
letters
as
usual
and
some
of
them
were
more
than
ordinarily
interesting
she
too
had
a
favourite
district
which
was
in
london
and
where
also
a
great
work
was
going
on
and
her
missionary
and
her
and
her
colporteur
were
all
in
a
wonderful
state
of
excitement
about
a
new
which
was
being
fitted
out
and
decorated
in
the
highest
style
of
art
on
the
borders
of
their
especial
domain
they
were
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
prevent
this
temple
of
satan
from
being
licensed
and
some
of
them
were
so
very
certain
of
the
divine
acquiescence
in
their
measures
that
they
announced
the
success
of
their
exertions
to
be
a
test
of
the
faithfulness
of
god
which
miss
leonora
read
out
to
her
sisters
as
an
instance
of
very
touching
and
beautiful
faith
miss
wentworth
perhaps
was
not
so
clear
on
that
subject
during
the
course
of
her
silent
life
she
had
prayed
for
various
things
which
it
had
not
been
god
pleasure
to
grant
and
just
now
she
too
was
very
anxious
about
frank
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
bad
way
so
she
rather
shook
her
head
gently
though
she
did
not
contravene
the
statement
and
concluded
with
sadness
that
the
government
of
the
earth
might
still
go
on
as
usual
and
god
goodness
remain
as
certain
as
ever
even
though
the
was
licensed
or
frank
did
fall
away
this
was
the
teaching
of
experience
but
aunt
cecilia
did
not
utter
it
for
that
was
not
her
way
as
for
miss
dora
she
agreed
in
all
the
sentiments
and
thought
them
beautiful
as
leonora
said
and
was
not
much
disturbed
by
any
opinion
of
her
own
expressed
or
unexpressed
but
interspersed
her
breakfast
with
little
sighing
ejaculations
of
the
temptations
of
the
world
and
how
little
one
knew
what
was
passing
around
one
and
let
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
which
could
not
have
failed
to
attract
miss
attention
and
draw
forth
the
whole
story
of
her
sister
suspicions
had
not
that
woman
been
as
we
have
already
mentioned
too
deeply
engaged
perhaps
her
nephew
imaginary
backsliding
might
have
excited
even
miss
leonora
to
an
interest
deeper
than
that
which
was
awakened
by
the
new
but
as
it
happened
it
was
the
humbler
intelligence
alone
which
occupied
itself
with
the
supposed
domestic
calamity
miss
dora
breakfast
was
affected
by
it
in
a
way
which
did
not
appear
in
the
morning
meal
of
her
sister
for
somehow
the
most
fervent
love
of
souls
seldom
takes
away
the
appetite
as
the
love
of
some
unlucky
individual
occasionally
does
when
breakfast
was
over
miss
dora
made
a
very
elaborate
excuse
for
going
out
by
herself
she
wanted
to
match
some
wool
for
a
blanket
she
was
making
for
louisa
baby
the
devoted
aunt
said
with
a
little
tremor
poor
louisa
if
gerald
were
to
go
any
further
you
know
it
would
be
so
sad
for
her
and
one
would
like
to
help
to
keep
up
her
heart
poor
dear
as
much
as
one
could
by
means
of
a
blanket
for
the
bassinet
in
scarlet
and
white
said
miss
leonora
but
it
quite
the
kind
of
comfort
for
louisa
i
wonder
if
she
ever
had
the
smallest
inkling
what
kind
of
a
husband
she
has
got
i
do
think
frank
is
far
wrong
about
gerald
though
i
do
pin
my
faith
to
my
nephew
judgment
i
daresay
he
go
mad
or
do
worse
with
all
those
crotchets
of
his
but
what
he
married
louisa
for
has
always
been
a
mystery
to
me
i
suppose
because
he
was
very
fond
of
her
suggested
miss
dora
with
humility
but
why
was
he
fond
of
her
a
goose
said
the
sister
and
so
went
about
her
without
further
comment
leaving
aunt
dora
to
pursue
her
independent
career
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
and
yet
of
guilt
that
this
timid
inquirer
set
forth
on
her
mission
exchanging
a
sympathetic
significant
look
with
miss
wentworth
before
she
went
out
if
she
should
meet
frank
at
the
door
looking
dignified
and
virtuous
what
could
she
possibly
say
to
him
and
yet
perhaps
he
had
only
been
imprudent
and
did
not
mean
anything
miss
dora
looked
round
her
on
both
sides
up
and
down
grange
lane
as
she
went
out
into
the
lovely
summer
morning
neither
frank
nor
any
other
soul
except
some
was
to
be
seen
along
the
whole
line
of
sunny
road
she
was
relieved
yet
she
was
disappointed
at
the
same
time
and
went
slowly
up
towards
elsworthy
shop
saying
to
herself
that
she
was
sure
frank
could
not
mean
anything
it
must
have
been
that
forward
little
thing
herself
who
had
come
up
to
him
when
he
was
out
for
his
walk
or
it
must
have
been
an
accident
but
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
heard
the
curate
call
rosa
pretty
and
miss
dora
wondered
within
herself
what
it
mattered
whether
she
was
pretty
or
not
and
what
he
had
to
do
with
it
and
shook
her
head
over
the
strange
way
men
had
of
finding
out
such
things
for
her
own
part
she
was
sure
she
never
looked
whether
the
girl
was
pretty
or
not
and
the
anxious
aunt
had
just
come
round
again
by
a
very
circuitous
and
perplexing
course
to
her
original
sentiment
and
strengthened
herself
in
the
thought
that
her
dear
frank
could
not
mean
anything
when
she
reached
elsworthy
door
that
worthy
trader
was
himself
behind
the
counter
managing
matters
with
his
usual
exactness
berlin
wool
was
one
of
the
articles
mr
elsworthy
dealt
in
besides
newspapers
and
books
when
they
were
ordered
miss
dora
who
wore
no
crinoline
stumbled
over
her
dress
in
her
agitation
as
she
went
in
and
saw
at
the
first
glance
little
rosa
looking
very
blooming
and
pretty
tying
up
a
parcel
at
the
other
end
of
the
shop
the
poor
lady
did
not
know
how
to
enter
upon
so
difficult
a
question
she
offered
her
wool
humbly
to
be
matched
and
listened
to
mr
elsworthy
sentiments
on
the
subject
he
told
her
how
he
always
had
his
wools
from
the
best
houses
in
london
and
could
match
anything
as
was
ever
made
in
that
line
and
was
proud
to
say
as
he
always
gave
satisfaction
miss
dora
could
not
see
any
opening
for
the
inquiries
she
hoped
to
make
for
how
was
it
possible
to
intimate
the
possibility
of
disapproval
to
an
establishment
so
perfect
in
all
its
arrangements
the
probabilities
are
that
she
would
have
gone
away
without
saying
anything
had
not
mr
elsworthy
himself
given
her
a
chance
miss
wodehouse
has
been
my
great
help
said
the
shopkeeper
she
is
the
nicest
lady
is
miss
wodehouse
in
all
carlingford
i
do
respect
them
people
they
had
their
troubles
like
most
families
but
there
aint
many
as
can
lay
their
finger
on
the
skeleton
as
is
in
their
cupboard
they
kept
things
close
and
there
aint
a
many
as
knows
but
miss
wodehouse
has
spoke
up
for
me
right
and
left
and
most
persons
as
count
for
anything
in
carlingford
gets
their
fancy
articles
out
o
my
shop
mr
wentworth
our
respected
clergyman
gets
all
his
papers
of
me
and
partickler
he
is
to
a
degree
and
likes
to
have
first
thing
afore
they
opened
out
o
the
parcel
it
the
way
with
gentlemen
when
they
young
mostly
people
aint
so
partickler
later
in
life
not
as
i
could
tell
the
reason
why
unless
it
may
be
that
folks
gets
used
to
most
things
and
stop
looking
for
anything
new
but
there
aint
a
many
young
gentlemen
like
our
clergyman
though
i
say
it
as
should
continued
mr
elsworthy
with
a
little
effusion
as
he
succeeded
in
finding
an
exact
match
for
the
scarlet
wool
and
why
should
you
say
it
mr
elsworthy
said
miss
dora
a
little
tartly
you
are
not
in
any
way
particularly
connected
with
my
nephew
here
she
gave
an
angry
glance
at
rosa
who
had
drawn
near
to
listen
having
always
in
her
vain
little
heart
a
certain
palpitation
at
mr
wentworth
name
i
ask
your
pardon
i
clerk
at
st
roque
it
aint
often
as
we
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
there
more
the
pity
said
the
church
official
though
i
may
say
there
aint
a
church
as
perfect
or
where
the
duty
is
performed
more
beautiful
in
all
the
country
and
there
never
was
a
clergyman
as
had
the
people
good
at
heart
like
mr
wentworth
not
in
my
time
it
aint
no
matter
whether
you
rich
or
poor
young
or
old
if
there
a
service
as
can
be
done
to
ever
a
one
in
his
way
our
clergyman
is
the
man
to
do
it
why
no
further
gone
than
last
night
if
you
believe
me
that
little
girl
there
yes
said
miss
dora
eagerly
looking
with
what
was
intended
to
be
a
very
stern
and
forbidding
aspect
in
the
little
girl
face
she
was
up
grange
lane
in
the
dark
said
mr
elsworthy
not
as
there
was
any
need
and
me
keeping
two
boys
but
she
likes
a
run
out
of
an
evening
when
mr
wentworth
see
her
and
come
up
to
her
it
aint
what
many
men
would
have
done
said
the
admiring
but
unlucky
adherent
of
the
suspected
curate
he
come
up
seeing
as
she
was
by
herself
and
walked
by
her
and
gave
her
a
deal
of
good
advice
and
brought
her
home
her
aunt
and
me
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
to
see
the
clergyman
at
our
door
brought
rosa
home
he
said
making
believe
a
bit
sharp
send
her
out
no
more
so
late
at
night
and
was
off
like
a
shot
not
waiting
for
no
thanks
it
my
opinion
as
there
aint
many
such
gentlemen
i
ca
call
to
mind
as
i
ever
met
with
his
fellow
before
but
a
young
creature
like
that
ought
not
to
have
been
out
so
late
said
miss
dora
trying
to
harden
herself
into
severity
i
wonder
very
much
that
you
like
to
walk
up
grange
lane
in
the
dark
i
should
think
it
very
unpleasant
for
my
part
and
i
am
sure
i
would
not
allow
it
mr
elsworthy
she
said
firmly
if
such
a
girl
belonged
to
me
but
please
i
was
walking
up
grange
lane
said
rosa
with
some
haste
i
was
at
mrs
hadwin
where
mr
wentworth
lives
i
am
sure
i
did
not
want
to
trouble
him
said
the
little
beauty
recovering
her
natural
spirit
as
she
went
on
but
he
insisted
on
walking
with
me
it
was
all
his
own
doing
i
am
sure
i
did
want
him
and
here
rosa
broke
off
abruptly
with
a
consciousness
in
her
heart
that
she
was
being
lectured
she
rushed
to
her
defensive
weapons
by
natural
instinct
and
grew
crimson
all
over
her
pretty
little
face
and
flashed
lightning
out
of
her
eyes
which
at
the
same
time
were
not
disinclined
to
tears
all
this
miss
dora
made
note
of
with
a
sinking
heart
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
went
to
mrs
hadwin
to
see
mr
wentworth
asked
that
unlucky
inquisitor
with
a
world
of
horror
in
her
face
i
went
with
the
papers
said
rosa
and
i
i
met
him
in
the
garden
i
am
sure
it
was
my
fault
said
the
girl
bursting
into
petulant
tears
nobody
has
any
occasion
to
scold
me
it
was
mr
wentworth
as
would
come
and
rosa
sobbed
and
lighted
up
gleams
of
defiance
behind
her
tears
miss
dora
sat
looking
at
her
with
a
very
troubled
pale
face
she
thought
all
her
fears
were
true
and
matters
worse
than
she
imagined
and
being
quite
unused
to
private
inquisitions
of
course
she
took
all
possible
steps
to
create
the
scandal
for
which
she
had
come
to
look
did
you
ever
meet
him
in
the
garden
before
asked
miss
dora
painfully
in
a
low
voice
during
this
conversation
mr
elsworthy
had
been
looking
on
perplexed
not
perceiving
the
drift
of
the
examination
he
roused
himself
up
to
answer
now
a
little
alarmed
to
tell
the
truth
by
the
new
lights
thrown
on
the
subject
and
vexed
to
see
how
unconsciously
far
both
the
women
had
gone
it
aint
easy
to
go
into
a
house
in
grange
lane
without
meeting
of
some
one
in
the
garden
said
mr
elsworthy
not
as
i
mean
to
say
it
was
the
right
thing
for
rosa
to
be
going
them
errands
after
dark
my
orders
is
against
that
as
she
knows
and
what
the
good
of
keeping
two
boys
if
things
is
to
be
done
at
the
right
time
mr
wentworth
himself
was
of
me
for
sending
out
rosa
as
it
might
be
the
last
time
he
was
here
for
she
one
of
them
as
sits
in
the
chancel
and
helps
in
the
singing
and
he
feels
an
interest
in
her
natural
said
the
apologetic
clerk
miss
dora
gave
him
a
troubled
look
but
took
no
further
notice
of
his
speech
she
thought
with
an
instinctive
contempt
for
the
masculine
spectator
that
it
was
impossible
he
could
know
anything
about
it
and
pursued
her
own
wiser
way
it
is
very
wrong
of
you
a
girl
in
your
position
said
miss
dora
as
severely
as
she
could
in
her
soft
old
voice
to
be
seen
walking
about
with
a
gentleman
even
when
he
is
your
clergyman
and
of
course
has
nothing
else
in
his
head
young
men
do
think
anything
of
it
said
the
rash
but
timid
preacher
of
course
it
was
only
to
take
care
of
you
and
keep
you
out
of
harm
way
but
then
you
ought
to
think
what
a
trouble
it
was
to
mr
wentworth
taking
him
away
from
his
studies
and
it
is
not
nice
for
a
young
girl
like
you
miss
dora
paused
to
take
breath
not
feeling
quite
sure
in
her
own
mind
whether
this
was
the
right
thing
to
say
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
disbelieved
the
fact
altogether
and
declared
it
impossible
she
was
much
troubled
about
it
as
she
stood
looking
into
the
flushed
tearful
face
with
all
that
light
of
defiance
behind
the
tears
and
felt
instinctively
that
little
rosa
still
only
a
pretty
obstinate
vain
uneducated
little
girl
was
more
than
a
match
for
herself
with
all
her
experiences
the
little
thing
was
bristling
with
a
hundred
natural
weapons
and
defences
against
which
miss
dora
weak
assault
had
no
chance
if
it
was
a
trouble
he
need
not
have
come
said
rosa
more
and
more
convinced
that
mr
wentworth
must
certainly
have
meant
something
i
am
sure
did
not
want
him
he
insisted
on
coming
though
i
begged
him
not
i
do
know
why
i
should
be
spoke
to
like
this
cried
the
little
coquette
with
tears
for
i
never
was
one
as
looked
at
a
gentleman
it
them
with
a
sob
as
comes
after
me
rosa
said
mr
elsworthy
much
alarmed
your
aunt
is
sure
to
be
looking
out
for
you
and
i
do
want
you
here
not
now
nor
i
want
you
again
for
errands
and
do
you
forget
if
it
had
been
that
mr
wentworth
thought
you
a
silly
little
thing
and
had
a
kind
feeling
for
my
missis
and
me
you
do
think
he
have
took
that
charge
of
you
and
i
wo
have
my
clergyman
as
has
always
been
good
to
me
and
mine
made
a
talk
of
you
excuse
me
he
said
in
an
under
tone
as
rosa
reluctantly
went
away
not
to
her
aunt
however
but
again
to
her
parcel
at
the
other
end
of
the
shop
she
aint
used
to
being
talked
to
she
but
a
child
and
do
know
no
better
and
after
all
said
rosa
uncle
with
a
little
pride
she
is
a
little
thing
she
do
know
no
better
she
led
away
by
a
kind
word
for
nobody
can
say
but
she
wonderful
pretty
as
is
very
plain
to
see
is
she
said
miss
dora
following
the
little
culprit
to
the
with
disenchanted
eyes
then
you
had
better
take
all
the
better
care
of
her
mr
elsworthy
she
said
with
again
a
little
asperity
the
fact
was
that
miss
dora
had
behaved
very
injudiciously
and
was
partly
aware
of
it
and
then
this
prettiness
of
little
rosa
even
though
it
shone
at
the
present
moment
before
her
was
not
so
plain
to
her
eyes
she
did
not
make
out
why
everybody
was
so
sure
of
it
nor
what
it
mattered
and
very
probably
if
she
could
have
had
her
own
way
would
have
liked
to
give
the
little
insignificant
thing
a
good
shake
and
asked
her
how
she
dared
to
attract
the
eye
of
the
perpetual
curate
as
she
could
not
do
this
however
miss
dora
gathered
up
her
wool
and
refused
to
permit
mr
elsworthy
to
send
it
home
for
her
i
can
carry
it
quite
well
myself
said
the
indignant
little
woman
i
am
sure
you
must
have
a
great
deal
too
much
for
your
boys
to
do
or
you
would
not
send
your
niece
about
with
the
things
but
if
you
will
take
my
advice
mr
elsworthy
said
miss
dora
you
will
take
care
of
that
poor
little
thing
she
will
be
getting
ridiculous
notions
into
her
head
and
aunt
dora
went
out
of
the
shop
with
great
solemnity
quite
unaware
that
she
had
done
more
to
put
ridiculous
notions
into
rosa
head
than
could
have
got
there
by
means
of
a
dozen
darkling
walks
by
the
side
of
the
majestic
curate
who
never
paid
her
any
compliments
miss
dora
went
away
more
than
ever
convinced
in
her
mind
that
frank
had
forgotten
himself
and
his
position
and
everything
that
was
fit
and
seemly
she
jumped
to
a
hundred
horrible
conclusions
as
she
went
sadly
across
grange
lane
with
her
scarlet
wool
in
her
hand
what
leonora
would
say
to
such
an
irremediable
folly
and
how
the
squire
would
receive
his
son
after
such
a
he
might
change
his
views
said
poor
miss
dora
to
herself
but
he
could
not
change
his
wife
and
it
was
poor
comfort
to
call
rosa
a
designing
little
wretch
and
to
reflect
that
frank
at
first
could
not
have
meant
anything
the
poor
lady
had
a
bad
headache
and
was
in
a
terribly
depressed
condition
all
day
when
she
saw
from
the
window
of
her
the
pretty
figure
of
lucy
wodehouse
in
her
grey
cloak
pass
by
she
sank
into
tears
and
melancholy
reflections
but
then
lucy
wodehouse
views
were
highly
objectionable
and
she
bethought
herself
of
julia
trench
who
had
long
ago
been
selected
by
the
sisters
as
the
clergyman
wife
of
skelmersdale
miss
dora
shook
her
head
over
the
blanket
she
was
knitting
for
louisa
baby
thinking
of
wives
in
general
and
the
way
in
which
marriages
came
about
who
had
the
ordering
of
these
inexplicable
accidents
it
was
surely
not
providence
but
some
tricky
imp
or
other
who
loved
confusion
and
then
miss
dora
paused
with
compunction
and
hoped
she
would
be
forgiven
for
entertaining
even
for
one
passing
moment
such
a
wicked
wicked
thought
chapter
xii
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
mr
morgan
went
home
late
and
frightened
his
wife
out
of
her
propriety
by
the
excitement
and
trouble
in
his
face
he
could
do
nothing
but
groan
as
he
sat
down
in
the
where
she
had
just
been
gathering
her
work
together
and
putting
stray
matters
in
order
before
she
went
to
make
herself
tidy
for
dinner
the
rector
paid
no
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
was
approaching
and
only
shook
his
head
and
repeated
his
groan
when
she
asked
him
anxiously
what
was
the
matter
the
good
man
was
too
much
flushed
and
heated
and
put
out
to
be
able
at
first
to
answer
her
questions
very
bad
very
bad
he
said
when
he
had
recovered
sufficient
composure
far
worse
than
i
feared
my
dear
i
am
afraid
the
beginning
of
my
work
in
carlingford
will
be
for
ever
associated
with
pain
to
us
both
i
am
discouraged
and
distressed
beyond
measure
by
what
i
have
heard
dear
william
tell
me
what
it
is
said
the
rector
wife
i
feared
it
was
a
bad
business
from
the
first
said
the
disturbed
rector
i
confess
i
feared
when
i
saw
a
young
man
so
regardless
of
lawful
authority
that
his
moral
principles
must
be
defective
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
what
i
have
heard
my
dear
i
am
sorry
to
grieve
you
with
such
a
story
but
as
you
are
sure
to
hear
it
perhaps
it
is
better
that
you
should
have
the
facts
from
me
it
must
be
about
mr
wentworth
said
mrs
morgan
she
was
sorry
for
though
she
had
given
in
to
her
husband
vehemence
she
herself
in
her
own
person
had
always
been
prepossessed
in
favour
of
the
perpetual
curate
but
she
was
also
sensible
of
a
feeling
of
relief
to
know
that
the
misfortune
concerned
mr
wentworth
and
was
not
specially
connected
with
themselves
yes
it
about
mr
wentworth
said
the
rector
he
wiped
his
face
which
was
red
with
haste
and
exhaustion
and
shook
his
head
he
was
sincerely
shocked
and
grieved
to
do
him
justice
but
underneath
there
was
also
a
certain
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
he
had
foreseen
it
and
that
his
suspicions
were
verified
my
dear
i
am
very
glad
he
had
not
become
intimate
in
our
house
said
mr
morgan
that
would
have
complicated
matters
sadly
i
rejoice
that
your
womanly
instincts
prevented
that
inconvenience
and
as
the
rector
began
to
recover
himself
he
looked
more
severe
than
ever
yes
said
mrs
morgan
with
hesitation
for
the
truth
was
that
her
womanly
instincts
had
pronounced
rather
distinctly
in
favour
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
i
hope
he
has
not
done
anything
very
wrong
william
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
i
think
he
has
very
good
qualities
said
the
rector
wife
we
must
not
let
our
personal
objections
prejudice
us
in
respect
to
his
conduct
otherwise
i
am
sure
you
are
the
last
to
do
that
i
have
never
known
an
insubordinate
man
who
was
a
perfect
moral
character
said
the
rector
it
is
very
discouraging
altogether
and
you
thought
he
was
engaged
to
wodehouse
pretty
daughter
did
you
i
hope
not
i
sincerely
hope
not
that
would
make
things
doubly
bad
but
to
be
sure
when
a
man
is
faithless
to
his
most
sacred
engagements
there
is
very
little
dependence
to
be
placed
on
him
in
other
respects
but
you
have
not
told
me
what
it
is
said
the
rector
wife
with
some
anxiety
and
she
spoke
the
more
hastily
as
she
saw
the
shadow
of
a
curate
mr
morgan
own
curate
who
must
inevitably
be
invited
to
stop
to
dinner
crossing
the
lawn
as
she
spoke
she
got
up
and
went
a
little
nearer
the
window
to
make
sure
there
is
mr
leeson
she
said
with
some
vexation
i
must
run
and
get
ready
for
dinner
tell
me
what
it
is
upon
which
the
rector
with
some
circumlocution
described
the
appalling
occurrence
of
the
previous
night
how
mr
wentworth
had
walked
home
with
little
rosa
elsworthy
from
his
own
house
to
hers
as
had
of
course
been
seen
by
various
people
the
tale
had
been
told
with
variations
which
did
credit
to
the
ingenuity
of
carlingford
and
mr
morgan
version
was
that
they
had
walked
arm
in
arm
in
the
closest
conversation
and
at
an
hour
which
was
quite
unseemly
for
such
a
little
person
as
rosa
to
be
abroad
the
excellent
rector
gave
the
story
with
strong
expressions
of
disapproval
for
he
was
aware
of
having
raised
his
wife
expectations
and
had
a
feeling
as
he
related
them
that
the
circumstances
after
all
were
scarcely
sufficiently
horrifying
to
justify
his
preamble
mrs
morgan
listened
with
one
ear
towards
the
door
on
the
watch
for
mr
leeson
knock
was
that
all
said
the
sensible
woman
i
think
it
very
likely
it
might
be
explained
i
suppose
mr
leeson
must
have
stopped
to
look
at
my
ferns
he
is
very
tiresome
with
his
botany
that
was
all
dear
i
think
it
might
be
explained
i
ca
fancy
mr
wentworth
is
a
man
to
commit
himself
in
that
way
if
that
is
all
said
mrs
morgan
but
i
must
run
to
change
my
dress
that
was
not
all
said
the
rector
following
her
to
the
door
it
is
said
that
this
sort
of
thing
has
been
habitual
my
dear
he
takes
the
mail
you
know
all
to
himself
instead
of
having
the
like
other
people
and
she
carries
it
down
to
his
house
and
i
hear
of
meetings
in
the
garden
and
a
great
deal
that
is
very
objectionable
said
mr
morgan
speaking
very
fast
in
order
to
deliver
himself
before
the
advent
of
mr
leeson
i
afraid
it
is
a
very
bad
business
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
it
i
suppose
i
must
ask
leeson
to
stay
to
dinner
it
is
absurd
of
him
to
come
at
six
meetings
in
the
garden
said
mrs
morgan
aghast
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
believe
it
there
is
that
tiresome
man
at
last
do
as
you
like
dear
about
asking
him
to
stay
but
i
must
make
my
escape
and
the
rector
wife
hastened
divided
between
vexation
about
mr
leeson
and
regret
at
the
news
she
had
just
heard
she
put
on
her
dress
rather
hastily
and
was
conscious
of
a
little
for
which
she
was
angry
with
herself
and
the
haste
of
her
toilette
and
the
excitement
under
which
she
laboured
aggravated
unbecomingly
that
redness
of
which
mrs
morgan
was
painfully
sensible
she
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
her
own
appearance
as
she
looked
in
the
glass
perhaps
that
sense
of
looking
not
so
well
as
usual
brought
back
to
her
mind
a
troublesome
and
painful
idea
which
recurred
to
her
not
unfrequently
when
she
was
in
any
trouble
the
real
rector
to
whom
she
was
married
was
so
different
from
the
ideal
one
who
courted
her
could
it
be
possible
if
they
had
married
in
their
youth
instead
of
now
that
her
husband
would
have
been
less
open
to
the
suggestions
of
the
gossips
in
carlingford
and
less
jealous
of
the
interferences
of
his
young
neighbour
it
was
hard
to
think
that
all
the
and
patience
of
the
past
had
done
more
harm
than
good
but
though
she
was
conscious
of
his
defects
she
was
very
loyal
to
him
and
resolute
to
stand
by
him
whatever
he
might
do
or
say
though
mrs
morgan
womanly
instincts
which
the
rector
had
quoted
were
all
on
mr
side
and
convinced
her
of
his
innocence
to
start
with
on
the
whole
she
was
annoyed
and
uncomfortable
what
with
mr
leeson
intrusion
which
had
occurred
three
or
four
times
before
and
which
mrs
morgan
felt
it
her
duty
to
check
and
the
rector
uncharitableness
and
her
own
insufficient
time
to
dress
and
the
disagreeable
heightening
of
her
complexion
the
rector
wife
felt
in
rather
an
unchristian
frame
of
mind
she
did
not
look
well
and
she
did
not
feel
better
she
was
terribly
civil
to
the
curate
when
she
went
and
snubbed
him
in
the
most
unqualified
way
when
he
too
began
to
speak
about
mr
wentworth
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
at
all
a
likely
story
she
said
courageously
and
took
away
mr
leeson
breath
but
i
hear
a
very
unfavourable
general
account
said
the
rector
who
was
almost
equally
surprised
i
hear
he
has
been
playing
fast
and
loose
with
that
very
pretty
person
miss
wodehouse
and
that
her
friends
begin
to
be
indignant
it
is
said
that
he
has
not
been
nearly
so
much
there
lately
but
on
the
contrary
always
going
to
elsworthy
and
has
partly
educated
this
little
thing
my
dear
one
false
step
leads
to
another
i
am
not
so
incredulous
as
you
are
perhaps
i
have
studied
human
nature
a
little
more
closely
and
i
know
that
error
is
always
fruitful
that
is
my
experience
said
mr
morgan
his
wife
did
not
say
anything
in
answer
to
this
deliverance
but
she
lay
in
wait
for
the
curate
as
was
natural
and
had
her
revenge
upon
him
as
soon
as
his
ill
fate
prompted
him
to
back
the
rector
out
i
am
afraid
mr
wentworth
had
always
too
much
confidence
in
himself
said
the
unlucky
individual
who
was
destined
to
be
scapegoat
on
this
occasion
and
as
you
very
justly
observe
one
wrong
act
leads
to
another
he
has
thrown
himself
among
the
bargemen
on
such
an
equal
footing
that
i
daresay
he
has
got
to
like
that
kind
of
society
i
should
be
surprised
to
find
that
rosa
elsworthy
suited
him
better
than
a
lady
with
refined
tastes
mr
wentworth
is
a
gentleman
said
the
rector
wife
with
emphasis
coming
down
upon
the
unhappy
leeson
in
full
battle
array
i
do
think
he
would
go
into
the
poorest
house
if
it
were
even
a
bargeman
without
the
same
respect
of
the
privacy
of
the
family
as
is
customary
among
persons
of
our
own
class
mr
leeson
i
ca
tell
how
wrong
or
how
foolish
he
may
have
been
of
course
but
that
he
could
behave
to
anybody
in
a
disrespectful
manner
or
show
himself
intrusive
or
forget
the
usages
of
good
society
said
mrs
morgan
who
was
looking
all
the
time
at
the
unfortunate
curate
i
am
perfectly
convinced
it
was
this
speech
which
made
mr
morgan
speak
seriously
as
he
called
it
later
the
same
night
to
his
wife
about
her
manner
to
poor
leeson
who
was
totally
extinguished
as
was
to
be
expected
mrs
morgan
busied
herself
among
her
flowers
all
the
evening
and
could
not
be
caught
to
be
admonished
until
it
was
time
for
prayers
so
that
it
was
in
the
sacred
retirement
of
her
own
chamber
that
the
remonstrance
was
delivered
at
last
the
rector
said
he
was
very
sorry
to
find
that
she
still
gave
way
to
temper
in
a
manner
that
was
unbecoming
in
a
clergyman
wife
he
was
surprised
after
all
her
experience
and
the
way
in
which
they
had
both
been
schooled
in
patience
to
find
she
had
still
to
learn
that
lesson
upon
which
mrs
morgan
who
had
been
thinking
much
on
the
subject
broke
forth
upon
her
husband
in
a
manner
totally
unprecedented
and
which
took
the
amazed
rector
altogether
by
surprise
oh
william
if
we
had
only
forestalled
the
lesson
and
been
prudent
she
cried
in
a
womanish
way
which
struck
the
rector
dumb
with
astonishment
if
we
had
been
afraid
to
marry
ten
years
ago
but
gone
into
life
when
we
were
young
and
fought
through
it
like
so
many
people
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
neither
you
nor
i
would
have
minded
what
gossips
said
or
listened
to
a
pack
of
stories
when
we
were
i
think
i
was
better
then
than
i
am
now
said
the
rector
wife
though
she
filled
that
elevated
position
she
was
only
a
woman
subject
to
outbreaks
of
sudden
passion
and
liable
to
tears
like
the
rest
mr
morgan
looked
very
blank
at
her
as
she
sat
there
crying
sobbing
with
the
force
of
a
sentiment
which
was
probably
untranslatable
to
the
surprised
man
he
thought
it
must
be
her
nerves
which
were
in
fault
somehow
and
though
much
startled
did
not
inquire
farther
into
it
having
a
secret
feeling
in
his
heart
that
the
less
that
was
said
the
better
on
that
subject
so
he
did
what
his
good
angel
suggested
to
him
kissed
his
wife
and
said
he
was
well
aware
what
heavy
calls
he
had
made
upon
her
patience
and
soothed
her
the
best
way
that
occurred
to
him
but
you
were
very
hard
upon
poor
leeson
my
dear
said
the
rector
with
his
puzzled
look
when
she
had
regained
her
composure
perhaps
she
was
disappointed
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
convey
her
real
meaning
to
her
husband
bosom
at
all
events
mrs
morgan
recovered
herself
immediately
and
flashed
forth
with
all
the
lively
freshness
of
a
temper
in
its
first
youth
he
deserved
a
great
deal
more
than
i
said
to
him
said
the
wife
it
might
be
an
advantage
to
take
the
furniture
as
it
was
all
new
though
it
is
a
perpetual
vexation
to
me
and
worries
me
out
of
my
life
but
there
was
no
need
to
take
the
curate
that
i
can
see
what
right
has
he
to
come
day
after
day
at
your
he
knows
we
dine
at
six
as
well
as
we
do
ourselves
and
i
do
believe
he
knows
what
we
have
for
dinner
exclaimed
the
incensed
mistress
of
the
house
for
he
always
makes
his
appearance
when
we
have
anything
he
likes
i
hope
i
know
my
duty
and
can
put
up
with
what
can
not
be
mended
continued
mrs
morgan
with
a
sigh
and
a
mental
reference
to
the
carpet
in
the
but
there
are
some
things
really
that
would
disturb
the
temper
of
an
angel
i
do
know
anybody
that
could
endure
the
sight
of
a
man
always
coming
unasked
to
dinner
and
he
to
speak
of
mr
wentworth
who
if
he
were
the
greatest
sinner
in
the
world
is
a
gentleman
mrs
morgan
broke
off
with
a
sparkle
in
her
eye
which
showed
that
she
had
neither
exhausted
the
subject
nor
was
ashamed
of
herself
and
the
rector
wisely
retired
from
the
controversy
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
good
man
and
dreamt
that
sir
charles
grandison
had
come
to
be
his
curate
in
place
of
mr
leeson
and
when
he
woke
concluded
quietly
that
mrs
morgan
had
experienced
a
little
attack
on
the
nerves
as
he
explained
afterwards
to
dr
marjoribanks
her
compunctions
her
longings
after
the
lost
life
they
might
have
lived
together
her
wistful
womanish
sense
of
the
impoverished
existence
deprived
of
so
many
experiences
on
which
they
had
entered
in
the
dry
maturity
of
their
middle
age
remained
for
ever
a
mystery
to
her
faithful
husband
he
was
very
fond
of
her
and
had
a
high
respect
for
her
character
but
if
she
had
spoken
sanscrit
he
could
not
have
had
less
understanding
of
the
meaning
her
words
were
intended
to
convey
notwithstanding
a
vague
idea
that
his
wife
was
disposed
to
side
with
mr
wentworth
had
penetrated
the
brain
of
the
rector
and
was
not
without
its
results
he
told
her
next
morning
in
his
curt
way
that
he
thought
it
would
be
best
to
wait
a
little
before
taking
any
steps
in
the
wharfside
business
if
all
i
hear
is
true
we
may
have
to
proceed
in
a
different
way
against
the
unhappy
young
man
said
mr
morgan
solemnly
and
he
took
care
to
ascertain
that
mr
leeson
had
an
invitation
somewhere
else
to
dinner
which
was
doing
the
duty
of
a
tender
husband
as
everybody
will
allow
chapter
xiii
i
want
to
know
what
all
this
means
about
young
wentworth
said
mr
wodehouse
he
gone
off
it
appears
in
a
hurry
nobody
knows
where
well
so
they
say
to
his
brother
is
it
could
know
that
but
look
here
that
not
all
nor
nearly
all
they
say
he
meets
that
little
rosa
at
elsworthy
every
night
and
walks
home
with
her
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
tell
you
i
do
know
that
what
people
say
you
ought
to
understand
all
the
rights
of
it
you
two
girls
i
confess
i
thought
it
was
lucy
he
was
after
for
my
part
and
a
very
bad
match
too
and
one
i
should
never
have
given
my
consent
to
and
then
there
is
another
fine
talk
about
some
fellow
he
got
at
his
house
what
the
matter
molly
she
looks
as
if
she
was
going
to
faint
oh
no
said
miss
wodehouse
faintly
and
i
do
believe
a
word
about
rosa
elsworthy
she
said
with
sudden
impetuosity
a
minute
after
i
am
sure
mr
wentworth
could
vindicate
himself
whenever
he
likes
i
daresay
the
one
story
is
just
as
true
as
the
other
but
then
said
the
gentle
elder
sister
turning
with
anxious
looks
towards
lucy
he
is
proud
as
is
natural
and
i
should
think
he
would
enter
into
explanations
if
he
thought
people
did
not
trust
him
without
them
that
is
all
stuff
said
mr
wodehouse
why
should
people
trust
him
i
do
understand
trusting
a
man
in
all
sorts
of
equivocal
circumstances
because
he
got
dark
eyes
and
a
handsome
face
which
seems
code
of
morality
but
i
thought
he
was
after
lucy
that
was
my
belief
and
i
want
to
know
if
it
all
off
it
never
was
on
papa
said
lucy
in
her
clearest
voice
i
have
been
a
great
deal
in
the
district
you
know
and
mr
wentworth
and
i
could
not
help
meeting
each
other
that
is
all
about
it
but
people
must
always
have
something
to
talk
about
in
carlingford
i
hope
you
do
think
i
and
rosa
elsworthy
could
go
together
she
went
on
turning
round
to
him
with
a
smile
i
do
think
that
would
be
much
of
a
compliment
and
saying
this
lucy
went
to
get
her
work
out
of
its
usual
corner
and
sat
down
opposite
to
her
father
with
a
wonderfully
composed
face
she
was
so
composed
indeed
that
any
interested
beholder
might
have
been
justified
in
thinking
that
the
work
suffered
in
consequence
for
it
seemed
to
take
nearly
all
lucy
strength
and
leisure
to
keep
up
that
look
oh
said
mr
wodehouse
that
how
it
was
then
i
wonder
why
that
confounded
puppy
came
here
so
constantly
i
do
like
that
sort
of
behaviour
do
you
go
into
the
district
any
more
and
meet
him
that
all
i
got
to
say
because
of
rosa
elsworthy
said
lucy
with
a
little
smile
which
did
not
flicker
naturally
but
was
apt
to
get
fixed
at
the
corners
of
her
pretty
mouth
that
would
never
do
papa
mr
wentworth
private
concerns
are
nothing
to
us
but
you
know
there
is
a
great
work
going
on
in
the
district
and
ca
be
interfered
with
said
the
young
sister
of
mercy
looking
up
at
him
with
a
decision
which
mr
wodehouse
was
aware
he
could
make
no
stand
against
and
when
she
stopped
speaking
lucy
did
a
little
work
which
was
for
the
district
too
all
this
time
she
was
admitting
to
herself
that
she
had
been
much
startled
by
this
news
about
rosa
elsworthy
much
startled
to
be
sure
it
was
not
like
mr
wentworth
and
very
likely
it
would
impair
his
influence
and
it
was
natural
that
any
friend
taking
an
interest
in
him
and
the
district
should
be
taken
a
little
aback
by
such
news
accordingly
lucy
sat
a
little
more
upright
than
usual
and
was
conscious
that
when
she
smiled
as
she
had
just
done
the
smile
did
not
glide
off
again
in
a
natural
way
but
settled
down
into
the
lines
of
her
face
with
a
kind
of
spasmodic
tenacity
she
could
do
a
great
deal
in
the
way
of
but
she
could
not
quite
command
these
refractory
muscles
mr
wodehouse
who
was
not
particularly
penetrating
could
not
quite
make
her
out
he
saw
there
was
something
a
little
different
from
her
ordinary
look
about
his
favourite
child
but
he
had
not
insight
enough
to
enable
him
to
comprehend
what
it
was
and
about
his
man
who
is
staying
at
mrs
hadwin
said
the
perplexed
churchwarden
does
any
one
know
who
the
fellow
is
i
do
understand
how
wentworth
has
got
into
all
this
hot
water
in
a
moment
here
the
rector
in
a
state
of
fury
and
his
aunts
and
now
here
this
little
bit
of
scandal
to
crown
all
and
who
is
this
fellow
in
his
house
it
must
be
somebody
he
has
taken
in
out
of
charity
said
miss
wodehouse
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
am
sure
it
is
somebody
whom
he
has
opened
his
doors
to
out
of
christian
charity
and
the
goodness
of
his
heart
i
do
understand
how
you
can
all
desert
him
at
the
first
word
all
the
years
he
has
been
here
you
know
there
never
was
a
whisper
against
him
and
is
it
in
reason
to
think
he
would
go
so
far
wrong
all
in
a
moment
cried
the
faithful
advocate
of
the
perpetual
curate
her
words
were
addressed
to
mr
wodehouse
but
her
eyes
sought
lucy
who
was
sitting
very
upright
doing
her
work
without
any
leisure
to
look
round
lucy
had
quite
enough
to
occupy
her
within
herself
at
that
emergency
and
the
tearful
appeal
of
her
elder
sister
had
no
effect
upon
her
as
for
mr
wodehouse
he
was
more
and
more
puzzled
how
to
interpret
these
tears
in
his
daughter
eyes
i
do
make
it
out
at
all
said
the
perplexed
father
getting
up
to
leave
the
room
i
hope
were
in
love
with
him
molly
you
ought
to
have
too
much
sense
for
that
a
pretty
mess
he
find
when
he
comes
home
but
he
must
get
out
of
it
the
best
way
he
can
for
ca
help
him
at
least
i
do
mean
to
have
him
asked
here
any
more
you
understand
lucy
he
said
turning
round
at
the
door
with
an
emphatic
creak
of
his
boots
but
lucy
had
no
mind
to
be
seduced
into
any
such
confession
of
weakness
you
are
always
having
everybody
in
carlingford
to
dinner
said
the
young
housekeeper
and
all
the
clergymen
even
mr
leeson
and
i
do
see
why
you
should
except
mr
wentworth
papa
he
has
done
nothing
wicked
so
far
as
we
know
i
daresay
he
wo
want
to
bring
rosa
elsworthy
with
him
and
why
should
he
be
asked
here
said
lucy
looking
full
in
his
face
with
her
bright
eyes
mr
wodehouse
was
entirely
discomfited
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
i
wonder
if
you
know
what
you
mean
yourselves
you
women
he
muttered
and
then
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
a
hasty
settle
it
as
you
please
the
churchwarden
boots
creaked
hastily
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
after
this
a
dead
silence
fell
upon
the
and
its
two
occupants
they
did
not
burst
forth
into
mutual
comment
upon
this
last
piece
of
carlingford
news
as
they
would
have
done
under
any
other
circumstances
on
the
contrary
they
bent
over
their
several
occupations
with
quite
an
unusual
devotion
not
exchanging
so
much
as
a
look
lucy
over
her
needlework
was
the
steadiest
of
the
two
she
was
still
at
the
same
point
in
her
thoughts
owning
to
herself
that
she
was
startled
and
indeed
shocked
by
what
she
had
heard
that
it
was
a
great
pity
for
mr
wentworth
perhaps
that
it
was
not
quite
what
might
have
been
expected
of
him
and
then
she
checked
herself
and
went
back
again
to
her
original
acknowledgment
to
tell
the
truth
though
she
assured
herself
that
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
a
strange
sense
of
having
just
passed
through
an
unexpected
illness
lay
underneath
lucy
composure
it
was
none
of
her
business
to
be
sure
but
she
could
not
help
feeling
as
if
she
had
just
had
a
fever
or
some
other
sudden
attack
and
that
nobody
knew
of
it
and
that
she
must
get
well
as
best
she
could
without
any
help
from
without
it
was
quite
half
an
hour
before
miss
wodehouse
got
up
from
the
knitting
which
she
had
spoiled
utterly
trying
to
take
up
the
dropped
stitches
with
her
trembling
fingers
and
dropping
others
by
every
effort
she
made
the
poor
lady
went
wistfully
about
the
room
wandering
from
corner
to
corner
as
if
in
search
of
something
at
last
she
took
courage
to
speak
when
she
found
herself
behind
her
young
sister
dear
i
am
sure
it
is
not
true
said
miss
wodehouse
suddenly
with
a
little
sob
and
then
she
came
close
to
lucy
chair
and
put
her
hand
timidly
upon
her
sister
shoulder
think
how
many
good
things
you
two
have
done
together
dear
and
is
it
likely
you
are
to
be
parted
like
this
said
the
injudicious
comforter
it
felt
rather
like
another
attack
of
fever
to
lucy
as
unexpected
as
the
last
do
speak
so
please
said
the
poor
girl
with
a
momentary
shiver
it
is
about
mr
wentworth
you
mean
she
went
on
after
a
little
without
turning
her
head
i
am
sorry
of
course
i
am
afraid
it
will
do
him
harm
and
then
she
made
a
pause
and
stumbled
over
her
sewing
with
fingers
which
felt
feeble
and
powerless
to
the
very
tips
all
on
account
of
this
fever
she
had
had
but
i
do
know
any
reason
why
you
and
i
should
discuss
it
mary
she
said
getting
up
in
her
turn
not
quite
sure
whether
she
could
stand
at
this
early
period
of
her
convalescence
but
resolved
to
try
we
are
both
mr
friends
and
we
need
not
say
any
harm
of
him
i
have
to
get
something
out
of
the
storeroom
for
but
lucy
said
the
tender
trembling
sister
who
did
not
know
how
to
be
wise
and
silent
trust
him
and
do
oh
my
dear
it
will
break
my
heart
i
know
some
part
of
it
is
not
true
i
know
one
thing
in
which
he
is
quite
quite
innocent
oh
lucy
my
darling
if
you
distrust
him
it
will
be
returning
evil
for
good
cried
poor
miss
wodehouse
with
tears
as
for
lucy
she
did
not
quite
know
what
her
sister
said
she
only
felt
that
it
was
cruel
to
stop
her
and
look
at
her
and
talk
to
her
and
there
woke
up
in
her
mind
a
fierce
sudden
spark
of
resistance
to
the
intolerable
why
do
you
hold
me
i
may
have
been
ill
but
i
can
stand
well
enough
by
myself
cried
lucy
to
her
sister
utter
bewilderment
that
is
i
i
mean
i
have
other
things
to
attend
to
she
cried
breaking
into
a
few
hot
tears
of
mortification
over
this
and
so
went
away
in
a
strange
glow
and
tremble
of
sudden
passion
such
as
had
never
been
seen
before
in
that
quiet
house
she
went
direct
to
the
storeroom
as
she
had
said
and
got
out
what
was
wanted
and
only
after
that
was
done
permitted
herself
to
go
up
to
her
own
room
and
turn
the
key
in
her
door
though
she
was
a
sister
of
mercy
and
much
beloved
in
prickett
lane
she
was
still
but
one
of
eve
poor
petulant
and
had
it
in
her
to
fly
at
an
intruder
on
her
suffering
like
any
other
wounded
creature
but
she
did
not
make
any
wild
demonstration
of
her
pain
even
when
shut
up
thus
in
her
fortress
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
a
kind
of
dull
heaviness
looking
into
vacancy
she
was
not
positively
thinking
of
mr
wentworth
or
of
any
one
thing
in
particular
she
was
only
conscious
of
a
terrible
difference
somehow
in
everything
about
her
in
the
air
which
choked
her
breathing
and
the
light
which
blinded
her
eyes
when
she
came
to
herself
a
little
she
said
over
and
over
that
everything
was
just
the
same
as
it
had
always
been
and
that
to
her
at
least
nothing
had
happened
but
that
declaration
though
made
with
vehemence
did
not
alter
matters
the
world
altogether
had
sustained
a
change
the
light
that
was
in
it
was
darkened
and
the
heart
stilled
all
at
once
instead
of
a
sweet
spontaneous
career
providing
for
its
own
wants
day
by
day
life
came
to
look
like
something
which
required
such
an
amount
of
courage
and
patience
and
endurance
as
lucy
had
not
at
hand
to
support
her
in
the
way
and
her
heart
failed
her
at
the
moment
when
she
found
this
out
notwithstanding
the
people
who
dined
at
mr
wodehouse
that
night
thought
it
a
very
agreeable
little
party
and
more
than
once
repeated
the
remark
so
familiar
to
most
persons
in
society
in
carlingford
that
wodehouse
parties
were
the
pleasantest
going
though
he
himself
was
humdrum
enough
two
or
three
of
the
people
present
had
heard
the
gossip
about
mr
wentworth
and
discussed
it
as
was
natural
taking
different
views
of
the
subject
and
poor
miss
wodehouse
took
up
his
defence
so
warmly
and
with
such
tearful
vehemence
that
there
were
smiles
to
be
seen
on
several
faces
as
for
lucy
she
made
only
a
very
simple
remark
on
the
subject
she
said
mr
wentworth
is
a
great
friend
of
ours
and
i
think
i
would
rather
not
hear
any
gossip
about
him
of
course
there
were
one
or
two
keen
observers
who
put
a
subtle
meaning
to
this
and
knew
what
was
signified
by
her
looks
and
her
ways
all
the
evening
but
most
likely
they
were
altogether
mistaken
in
their
suppositions
for
nobody
could
possibly
watch
her
so
closely
as
did
miss
wodehouse
who
know
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
at
the
close
of
the
evening
whether
her
young
sister
was
very
wretched
or
totally
indifferent
the
truth
was
certainly
not
to
be
discovered
for
that
night
at
least
in
lucy
looks
chapter
xiv
the
next
afternoon
there
were
signs
of
a
considerable
commotion
in
mr
elsworthy
shop
rosa
had
disappeared
altogether
and
mrs
elsworthy
with
an
ominous
redness
on
her
cheeks
had
taken
the
place
generally
held
by
that
more
agreeable
little
figure
all
the
symptoms
of
having
been
engaged
in
an
affray
from
which
she
had
retired
not
altogether
victorious
were
in
mrs
elsworthy
face
and
the
vanished
from
her
neighbourhood
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
found
out
little
parcels
to
deliver
which
would
have
eluded
their
most
anxious
search
in
other
circumstances
mr
elsworthy
himself
occupied
his
usual
place
in
the
foreground
without
the
usual
marks
of
universal
content
and
satisfaction
with
all
his
surroundings
which
generally
distinguished
him
an
indescribable
appearance
of
having
been
recently
snubbed
hung
about
the
excellent
man
and
his
glances
towards
the
and
the
glances
directed
from
the
to
him
told
with
sufficient
significance
the
quarter
from
which
his
humiliation
had
proceeded
it
had
done
him
good
as
such
painful
discipline
generally
does
for
he
was
clearing
out
some
drawers
in
which
sundry
quires
of
paper
had
broken
loose
and
run
into
confusion
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
ought
to
have
done
it
weeks
ago
as
for
the
partner
of
his
bosom
she
was
standing
in
the
obscure
distance
behind
the
counter
knitting
a
blue
stocking
which
was
evidently
intended
for
no
foot
but
his
there
was
a
chair
close
by
but
mrs
elsworthy
disdained
to
sit
down
she
stood
with
her
knitting
in
conscious
power
now
and
then
suffering
a
confession
of
her
faith
to
escape
her
there
nothing
as
do
go
contrary
in
this
world
said
the
discontented
wife
when
a
man
a
fool
it
was
hard
upon
mr
elsworthy
that
his
ears
were
sharp
and
that
he
knew
exactly
what
this
agreeable
murmur
was
but
he
was
wise
in
his
generation
and
made
no
reply
things
were
in
this
condition
when
of
all
persons
in
carlingford
it
occurred
to
miss
leonora
wentworth
to
enter
mr
elsworthy
shop
not
that
she
was
alone
or
bent
upon
any
errand
of
inquiry
for
miss
leonora
seldom
moved
about
unattended
by
her
sisters
whom
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
take
out
for
exercise
and
wonderfully
enough
she
had
not
found
out
yet
what
was
the
source
of
miss
dora
mysteries
and
depression
having
been
still
occupied
meantime
by
her
own
great
work
in
her
london
district
and
the
affair
of
the
which
was
still
undecided
she
had
been
talking
a
great
deal
about
this
for
the
last
hours
and
to
hear
miss
leonora
you
might
have
supposed
that
all
the
powers
of
heaven
must
fail
and
be
discomfited
before
this
potent
instrument
of
evil
and
that
after
all
bibles
and
missionaries
were
much
less
effective
than
the
stoppage
of
the
licence
upon
which
all
her
agents
were
bent
at
all
events
such
an
object
of
interest
had
swept
out
from
her
thoughts
the
vague
figure
of
her
nephew
frank
and
aunt
dora
mysterious
anxieties
on
his
account
when
the
three
ladies
approached
elsworthy
the
first
thing
that
attracted
their
attention
was
rosa
the
little
rosa
who
had
been
banished
from
the
shop
and
whom
mrs
elsworthy
believed
to
be
expiating
her
sins
in
a
back
room
in
tears
and
darkness
instead
of
which
the
little
girl
was
looking
out
of
her
favourite
window
and
amusing
herself
much
with
all
that
was
going
on
in
grange
lane
though
she
was
fluttered
by
the
scolding
she
had
received
rosa
only
looked
prettier
than
usual
with
her
flushed
cheeks
and
so
many
things
had
been
put
into
her
nonsensical
little
head
during
the
last
two
days
especially
by
her
aunt
denunciations
that
her
sense
of
was
very
much
heightened
in
consequence
she
looked
at
the
miss
wentworths
with
a
throb
of
mingled
pride
and
alarm
wondering
whether
perhaps
she
might
know
more
of
them
some
day
if
mr
wentworth
was
really
fond
of
her
as
people
said
which
thought
gave
rosa
a
wonderful
sensation
of
awe
and
delighted
vanity
meanwhile
the
three
miss
wentworths
looked
at
her
with
very
diverse
feelings
i
must
speak
to
these
people
about
that
little
girl
if
nobody
else
has
sense
enough
to
do
it
said
miss
leonora
she
is
evidently
going
wrong
as
fast
as
she
can
the
little
fool
and
the
sister
went
into
mr
elsworthy
in
this
perfectly
composed
and
ordinary
frame
of
mind
with
her
head
full
of
the
application
which
was
to
be
made
to
the
licensing
magistrates
today
in
the
parish
of
st
michael
and
totally
unaware
that
anybody
belonging
to
herself
could
ever
be
connected
with
the
incautious
little
coquette
at
the
window
miss
dora
feelings
were
very
different
it
was
much
against
her
will
that
she
was
going
at
all
into
this
obnoxious
shop
and
the
eyes
which
she
hastily
uplifted
to
the
window
and
withdrew
again
with
lively
disgust
and
dislike
were
both
angry
and
tearful
little
forward
shameless
thing
miss
dora
said
to
herself
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
as
for
miss
wentworth
it
was
not
her
custom
to
say
anything
but
she
too
looked
up
and
saw
the
pretty
face
at
the
window
and
secretly
concluded
that
it
might
all
be
quite
true
and
that
she
had
known
a
young
man
make
a
fool
of
himself
before
now
for
such
another
so
they
all
went
in
unwitting
that
they
came
at
the
end
of
a
domestic
hurricane
and
that
the
waters
were
still
in
a
state
of
disturbance
miss
wentworth
took
the
only
chair
as
was
natural
and
sat
down
sweetly
to
wait
for
leonora
and
miss
dora
lingered
behind
while
her
sister
made
her
purchases
miss
leonora
wanted
some
books
and
i
came
here
she
said
with
engaging
candour
because
i
see
no
other
shop
in
this
part
of
the
town
except
masters
which
of
course
i
would
not
enter
it
is
easy
enough
to
do
without
books
but
i
ca
afford
to
compromise
my
principles
mr
elsworthy
to
which
mr
elsworthy
had
replied
no
of
course
not
such
a
thing
aint
to
be
expected
with
one
eye
upon
his
customer
and
one
upon
his
belligerent
wife
and
by
the
by
if
you
will
permit
me
to
speak
about
what
does
not
concern
me
said
miss
leonora
cheerfully
i
think
you
should
look
after
that
little
girl
of
yours
more
carefully
recollect
i
mean
any
offence
but
she
very
pretty
you
know
and
very
young
and
vain
as
a
matter
of
course
i
saw
her
the
other
evening
going
down
grange
lane
a
great
deal
too
late
for
such
a
creature
to
be
out
and
though
i
do
doubt
you
are
very
particular
where
she
goes
it
was
at
this
conjuncture
that
mrs
elsworthy
who
could
not
keep
silence
any
longer
broke
in
ardently
with
all
her
in
front
of
her
disposed
like
a
kind
of
porcupine
mail
i
well
known
in
carlingford
better
known
than
most
said
mrs
elsworthy
with
a
sob
such
a
thing
as
not
being
particular
was
never
named
to
me
i
strive
and
i
toil
from
morning
to
night
as
all
things
should
be
respectable
and
kep
in
good
order
but
what
the
good
here
my
heart
broken
that
all
and
elsworthy
standing
gaping
like
a
gaby
as
he
is
there
aint
nothing
as
do
go
contrairy
when
folks
is
tied
to
a
set
of
fools
cried
the
indignant
matron
as
for
pretty
i
do
know
nothing
about
it
i
got
too
much
to
do
minding
my
own
business
them
as
has
nothing
to
think
of
but
stand
in
the
shop
and
twiddle
their
thumbs
ought
to
look
to
that
but
if
believe
me
it
aint
no
fault
of
mine
it
aint
my
will
to
throw
her
in
any
young
gentleman
way
not
to
say
a
clergyman
as
we
bound
to
respect
whatever
you
does
ladies
and
i
should
wonder
at
your
taking
away
your
custom
nor
nothing
else
as
was
a
punishment
blame
me
but
you
forget
mrs
elsworthy
that
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
nothing
at
all
my
nephew
knows
very
well
what
he
is
about
said
miss
dora
in
injudicious
haste
mr
wentworth
is
not
at
all
likely
to
forget
himself
continued
that
poor
lady
getting
confused
as
her
sister
turned
round
and
stared
at
her
of
course
it
was
all
out
of
kindness
i
i
know
frank
did
not
mean
anything
cried
the
unfortunate
aunt
leonora
look
as
she
turned
round
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
took
away
what
little
breath
miss
dora
had
mr
wentworth
asked
miss
leonora
i
should
be
glad
to
know
if
anybody
would
inform
me
what
mr
wentworth
can
possibly
have
to
do
with
it
i
daresay
you
misunderstood
me
i
said
you
were
to
look
after
that
little
girl
your
niece
or
whatever
she
is
i
did
not
say
anything
about
mr
wentworth
said
the
sister
looking
round
upon
them
all
for
the
moment
she
forgot
all
about
the
licence
and
turned
upon
mr
elsworthy
with
an
emphasis
which
almost
drive
that
troubled
citizen
to
his
knees
that
was
how
i
understood
it
said
the
clerk
of
st
roque
humbly
there
was
nothing
said
about
mr
wentworth
nor
there
could
be
as
i
know
of
but
what
was
in
his
favour
for
there
aint
many
young
men
like
our
clergyman
left
in
the
church
it
aint
because
speaking
to
respected
ladies
as
is
his
relations
folks
may
talk
said
mr
elsworthy
with
a
slight
faltering
but
i
never
see
his
equal
and
as
for
an
act
of
kindness
to
an
orphan
child
the
orphan
child
is
neither
here
nor
there
said
his
angry
wife
who
had
taken
up
her
post
by
his
side
a
dozen
fathers
and
mothers
could
have
done
better
by
her
than
we
done
and
to
go
and
lay
out
her
snares
for
them
as
is
so
far
above
her
if
you
believe
me
it
nigh
broken
my
heart
she
neither
flesh
nor
blood
mine
cried
the
aggrieved
woman
there
would
have
been
a
different
tale
to
tell
if
she
had
belonged
to
me
i
have
murdered
her
though
it
aint
proper
to
say
so
afore
we
have
gone
and
raised
a
talk
like
this
it
aint
my
blame
if
it
was
my
dying
word
cried
mrs
elsworthy
relapsing
into
angry
tears
i
one
as
has
always
shown
her
a
good
example
and
never
gone
flirting
about
nor
cast
my
eyes
to
one
side
or
another
for
the
best
man
as
ever
walked
and
to
think
as
a
respectable
family
should
be
brought
to
shame
through
her
doings
and
a
gentleman
as
is
a
clergyman
got
himself
talked
about
it
gone
nigh
to
kill
me
that
what
it
done
sobbed
the
virtuous
matron
and
i
do
see
as
nobody
cares
miss
leonora
had
been
woke
up
suddenly
out
of
her
abstract
occupations
she
penetrated
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
while
all
this
talk
was
going
on
she
transfixed
her
sister
dora
who
seemed
much
inclined
to
cry
like
mrs
elsworthy
with
a
look
which
overwhelmed
that
trembling
woman
then
she
addressed
herself
with
great
suavity
to
the
matter
in
hand
i
suppose
it
is
this
poor
little
foolish
child
who
has
been
getting
herself
talked
about
said
miss
leonora
it
a
pity
to
be
sure
but
i
daresay
it
not
so
bad
as
you
think
as
for
her
laying
snares
for
people
above
her
i
would
be
afraid
of
that
poor
little
thing
it
not
so
easy
as
you
think
laying
snares
perhaps
it
the
new
minister
at
salem
chapel
who
has
been
paying
attention
to
her
i
would
not
take
any
notice
of
it
if
i
were
you
do
let
her
loll
about
at
the
window
as
she
doing
and
do
let
her
go
out
so
late
and
give
her
plenty
of
work
to
do
my
maid
wants
some
one
to
help
in
her
needlework
perhaps
this
child
would
do
cecilia
said
miss
leonora
as
for
her
snares
poor
thing
i
do
feel
much
afraid
of
them
i
daresay
if
mr
wentworth
had
sunday
classes
for
the
young
people
as
i
wished
him
to
have
and
took
pains
to
give
them
proper
instruction
such
things
would
not
happen
if
you
send
her
to
my
maid
i
flatter
myself
she
will
soon
come
to
her
senses
good
morning
and
you
will
please
to
send
me
the
books
there
are
some
others
i
want
you
to
get
for
me
next
week
said
mr
elsworthy
patroness
i
will
follow
you
dora
please
and
miss
leonora
swept
her
sisters
out
before
her
and
went
upon
her
way
with
indescribable
grandeur
even
little
rosa
felt
the
change
where
she
sat
at
the
window
looking
out
the
little
vain
creature
no
longer
felt
it
possible
to
believe
as
she
looked
after
them
that
she
ever
could
be
anything
to
the
miss
wentworths
except
a
little
girl
in
a
shop
it
shook
her
confidence
in
what
people
said
and
it
was
as
well
for
her
that
she
withdrew
from
the
window
at
that
conjuncture
and
so
had
an
opportunity
of
hearing
her
aunt
come
and
of
darting
back
again
to
the
penitential
darkness
of
her
own
chamber
at
the
back
of
the
house
which
saved
rosa
some
angry
words
at
least
as
for
miss
leonora
wentworth
she
said
nothing
to
her
sisters
on
this
new
subject
she
saw
them
safely
home
to
their
own
apartments
and
went
out
again
without
explaining
her
movements
when
she
was
gone
miss
wentworth
listened
to
miss
dora
doubts
and
tears
with
her
usual
patience
but
did
not
go
into
the
matter
much
it
matter
whether
it
is
your
fault
or
not
said
aunt
cecilia
with
a
larger
amount
of
words
than
usual
and
a
sharpness
very
uncommon
with
her
but
i
daresay
leonora
will
set
it
all
right
after
all
the
confidence
which
the
elder
sister
had
in
leonora
was
justified
she
did
not
entirely
agree
with
her
about
the
great
work
nor
was
disposed
to
connect
the
of
the
in
any
way
with
the
faithfulness
of
god
but
she
comprehended
in
her
gentle
heart
that
there
were
other
matters
of
which
leonora
was
capable
as
for
miss
dora
she
went
to
the
at
last
and
seating
herself
at
the
window
cried
under
her
breath
till
she
had
a
very
bad
headache
and
was
of
no
use
for
any
purpose
under
heaven
she
thought
nothing
less
than
that
leonora
had
gone
abroad
to
denounce
poor
frank
and
tell
everybody
how
wicked
he
was
and
she
was
so
sure
her
poor
dear
boy
did
not
mean
anything
she
sat
with
her
head
growing
heavier
and
heavier
watching
for
her
sister
return
and
calculating
within
herself
how
many
places
leonora
must
have
called
at
and
how
utterly
gone
by
this
time
must
be
the
character
of
the
perpetual
curate
at
last
in
utter
despair
with
her
thin
curls
all
limp
about
her
poor
cheeks
miss
dora
had
to
go
to
bed
and
have
the
room
darkened
and
swallow
cups
of
green
tea
and
other
nauseous
compounds
at
the
will
and
pleasure
of
her
maid
who
was
learned
in
headache
the
poor
lady
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
after
a
time
and
saw
in
a
hideous
dream
her
sister
leonora
marching
from
house
to
house
of
poor
frank
friends
and
closing
door
after
door
with
all
sorts
of
clang
and
dash
upon
the
returning
prodigal
but
oh
it
was
not
my
fault
oh
my
dear
she
found
it
out
herself
you
do
not
think
was
to
blame
sobbed
poor
aunt
dora
in
her
troubled
slumber
and
her
headache
did
not
get
any
better
notwithstanding
the
green
tea
miss
dora
visions
were
partly
realised
for
it
was
quite
true
that
her
sister
was
making
a
round
of
calls
upon
frank
friends
miss
leonora
wentworth
went
out
in
great
state
that
day
she
had
her
handsomest
dress
on
and
the
bonnet
which
her
maid
had
calculated
upon
as
her
own
property
because
it
was
much
too
nice
for
miss
leonora
in
this
impossible
attire
she
went
to
see
mrs
hadwin
and
was
very
gracious
to
that
unsuspecting
woman
and
learned
a
few
things
of
which
she
had
not
the
least
conception
previously
then
she
went
to
the
miss
wodehouses
and
made
the
elder
sister
there
mighty
uncomfortable
by
her
keen
looks
and
questions
and
what
miss
leonora
did
after
that
was
not
distinctly
known
to
any
one
she
got
into
prickett
lane
somehow
and
stumbled
upon
no
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
inhabitants
and
before
she
returned
home
she
had
given
mrs
morgan
her
advice
about
the
virginian
creeper
which
was
intended
to
conceal
the
continual
passage
of
the
railway
trains
but
i
would
not
trust
to
i
would
build
up
the
wall
a
few
feet
higher
and
then
you
will
have
some
satisfaction
in
your
work
said
miss
leonora
and
left
the
wife
to
consider
the
matter
in
rather
an
agreeable
state
of
mind
for
that
had
been
mrs
morgan
opinion
all
along
after
this
last
visit
the
active
aunt
returned
home
going
leisurely
along
george
street
and
down
grange
lane
with
meditative
steps
miss
leonora
of
course
would
not
for
kingdoms
have
confessed
that
any
new
light
had
come
into
her
mind
or
that
some
very
ordinary
people
in
carlingford
no
one
of
whom
she
could
have
confidently
affirmed
to
be
a
converted
person
had
left
a
certain
vivid
and
novel
impression
upon
her
thoughts
she
went
along
much
more
slowly
than
usual
in
this
new
mood
of
reflectiveness
she
was
not
thinking
of
the
licensing
magistrates
of
st
michael
nor
the
beautiful
faith
of
the
colporteur
other
ideas
filled
her
mind
at
the
moment
whether
perhaps
after
all
a
man
who
did
his
duty
by
rich
and
poor
and
could
encounter
all
things
for
love
and
duty
sake
was
not
about
the
best
man
for
a
parish
priest
even
though
he
did
have
choristers
in
white
surplices
and
lilies
on
the
easter
altar
whether
it
might
not
be
a
comfort
to
know
that
in
the
pretty
parsonage
at
skelmersdale
there
was
some
one
ready
to
start
at
a
moment
notice
for
the
help
of
a
friend
or
the
succour
of
a
soul
brother
to
charley
who
won
the
cross
for
valour
and
not
unworthy
of
the
race
some
strange
moisture
came
into
the
corners
of
miss
leonora
eyes
there
was
gerald
too
whom
the
perpetual
curate
had
declared
to
be
the
best
man
he
ever
knew
and
the
evangelical
woman
with
all
her
prejudices
could
not
in
her
heart
deny
it
various
other
thoughts
of
a
similar
description
but
too
shadowy
to
bear
expression
came
in
spite
of
herself
through
miss
leonora
mind
we
know
that
god
heareth
not
sinners
but
if
any
man
be
a
worshipper
of
god
and
doeth
his
will
him
he
heareth
and
it
occurred
to
her
vaguely
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
harder
to
please
than
her
master
not
that
such
an
idea
could
get
possession
of
a
mind
so
well
fortified
at
the
first
assault
but
it
was
strange
how
often
the
thought
came
back
to
her
that
the
man
who
had
thrilled
through
all
those
people
about
prickett
lane
a
kind
of
vague
sense
that
they
were
christians
and
not
hopeless
wretches
forgotten
of
god
and
who
had
taken
in
the
mysterious
lodger
at
mrs
hadwin
bearing
the
penalty
of
suspicion
without
complaint
would
be
true
at
his
post
wherever
he
might
be
and
was
a
priest
of
god
appointing
such
were
the
strangely
novel
ideas
which
went
flashing
through
miss
leonora
mind
as
she
went
home
to
dinner
ejecting
summarily
the
new
and
her
favourite
colporteur
if
anybody
had
stated
them
in
words
she
would
have
indignantly
scouted
such
latitudinarian
stuff
but
they
kept
flickering
in
the
strangest
fluctuations
coming
and
going
bringing
in
native
wentworth
prejudices
and
natural
affections
to
overcome
all
other
prepossessions
in
the
most
inveterate
unexplainable
way
for
it
will
be
apparent
that
miss
leonora
being
a
woman
of
sense
utterly
scorned
the
rosa
elsworthy
hypothesis
and
comprehended
as
nearly
how
it
happened
as
it
was
possible
for
any
one
unaware
of
the
facts
to
do
such
were
the
good
and
bad
angels
who
fought
over
the
curate
fate
while
he
was
away
he
might
have
been
anxious
if
he
had
known
anything
about
them
or
had
been
capable
of
imagining
any
such
clouds
as
those
which
overshadowed
his
good
name
in
the
lively
imagination
of
carlingford
but
rosa
elsworthy
never
could
have
occurred
to
the
unconscious
young
man
as
a
special
danger
any
more
than
the
relenting
in
the
heart
of
his
aunt
leonora
could
have
dawned
upon
him
as
a
possible
happiness
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
left
home
so
far
as
he
himself
was
concerned
in
rather
a
happy
state
of
mind
than
otherwise
with
healthful
impulses
of
opposition
to
the
rector
and
confidence
in
the
sympathy
of
lucy
to
hear
that
lucy
had
given
him
up
and
that
miss
leonora
and
mrs
morgan
were
the
only
people
who
believed
in
him
would
have
gone
pretty
far
at
this
moment
to
make
an
end
of
the
perpetual
curate
but
fortunately
he
knew
nothing
about
it
and
while
lucy
held
her
head
high
with
pain
and
walked
over
the
burning
coals
a
conscious
martyr
and
miss
dora
sobbed
herself
asleep
in
her
darkened
room
all
on
his
account
there
was
plenty
of
trouble
perplexity
and
distress
in
wentworth
rectory
to
occupy
to
the
full
all
the
thoughts
and
powers
of
the
curate
of
st
roque

it
was
and
more
than
twelve
hours
after
he
had
left
carlingford
before
mr
wentworth
reached
the
rectory
he
had
snatched
a
few
sleep
in
london
where
he
was
obliged
to
pause
because
of
the
trains
which
did
not
correspond
and
accordingly
though
he
was
very
anxious
about
gerald
it
was
with
a
mien
and
gait
very
much
like
his
usual
appearance
that
he
jumped
out
of
the
railway
carriage
at
the
little
station
which
was
on
his
father
property
and
where
everybody
knew
the
squire
son
left
in
entire
uncertainty
as
he
was
in
respect
to
the
trouble
which
had
overtaken
his
brother
it
was
a
little
comfort
to
the
curate
to
find
that
everybody
looked
surprised
to
see
him
and
that
nobody
seemed
to
know
of
any
cause
demanding
his
presence
all
was
well
at
the
hall
so
far
as
the
knew
and
as
for
the
rector
he
had
no
special
place
in
the
local
report
which
the
handiest
porter
supplied
mr
frank
a
blessed
neglect
which
was
very
consolatory
to
the
heart
of
the
anxious
brother
to
whom
it
became
evident
that
nothing
had
happened
and
who
began
to
hope
that
gerald
wife
who
never
was
very
wise
had
been
seized
with
some
merely
fantastic
terror
with
this
hope
he
walked
on
briskly
upon
the
familiar
road
to
his
brother
house
recovering
his
courage
and
falling
back
upon
his
own
thoughts
and
at
last
taking
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
telling
all
his
troubles
to
gerald
and
getting
strength
and
enlightenment
from
his
advice
he
had
come
quite
into
this
view
of
the
subject
when
he
arrived
at
the
rectory
and
saw
the
pretty
house
with
its
high
ivied
and
the
famous
cedar
on
the
lawn
standing
all
secure
and
sweet
in
the
early
sunshine
like
something
too
steadfast
to
be
moved
as
if
sorrow
or
conflict
could
never
enter
there
unconsciously
to
himself
the
perfect
tranquillity
of
everything
altered
the
entire
scope
of
frank
wentworth
thoughts
he
was
no
longer
in
anxiety
about
his
brother
he
was
going
to
ask
gerald
advice
upon
his
own
troubles
and
lay
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
his
position
before
the
clear
and
lucid
eyes
of
the
best
man
he
ever
knew
it
shook
him
a
little
out
of
his
position
however
to
find
himself
admitted
with
a
kind
of
scared
expectation
by
mrs
gerald
maid
who
made
no
exclamation
of
wonder
at
the
sight
of
him
but
opened
the
door
in
a
troubled
stealthy
way
strangely
unlike
the
usual
customs
of
the
place
is
my
brother
at
home
said
the
curate
going
in
with
a
step
that
rang
on
the
hall
and
a
voice
that
sounded
into
the
house
he
would
have
proceeded
straight
as
usual
to
gerald
study
after
this
question
which
was
one
of
form
merely
but
for
the
disturbed
looks
of
the
woman
who
put
up
her
hand
imploringly
oh
hush
mr
frank
hush
my
mistress
wants
to
see
you
first
she
said
i
was
to
show
you
into
her
said
the
maid
half
in
a
whisper
and
led
him
hastily
down
a
to
a
little
room
which
he
knew
was
where
louisa
was
wont
to
retire
when
she
had
her
headaches
as
was
well
known
to
all
the
house
of
wentworth
the
curate
went
in
with
some
impatience
and
some
alarm
to
this
retired
apartment
his
eyes
dazzled
by
the
sunshine
could
not
penetrate
at
first
the
shadowy
greenness
of
the
room
which
what
with
the
trees
without
and
the
venetian
blind
within
was
lost
in
a
kind
of
twilight
grateful
enough
after
a
while
but
bewildering
at
the
first
moment
out
of
this
darkness
somebody
rose
as
he
entered
and
walked
into
his
arms
with
trembling
eagerness
oh
frank
i
am
so
thankful
you
are
come
now
perhaps
something
may
be
done
for
always
understood
said
his
little
reaching
up
to
kiss
him
she
was
a
tiny
little
woman
with
soft
eyes
and
a
tender
little
blooming
face
which
he
had
never
before
seen
obscured
by
any
cloud
or
indeed
moved
by
any
particular
sentiment
now
the
firmament
was
all
overcast
and
louisa
it
was
evident
had
been
sitting
in
the
shade
of
her
drawn
blinds
having
a
quiet
cry
and
going
into
all
her
grievances
to
see
such
a
serene
creature
all
clouded
over
and
full
of
tears
gave
the
curate
a
distinct
shock
of
alarm
and
anxiety
he
led
her
back
to
her
sofa
seeing
clearer
and
clearer
as
he
watched
her
face
the
plaintive
lines
of
complaint
the
heavy
burden
of
trouble
which
she
was
about
to
cast
on
his
shoulders
he
grew
more
and
more
afraid
as
he
looked
at
her
is
gerald
ill
he
said
with
a
thrill
of
terror
but
even
this
could
scarcely
account
for
the
woeful
look
of
all
the
accessories
to
the
picture
oh
frank
i
am
so
glad
you
are
come
said
louisa
through
her
tears
i
felt
sure
you
would
come
when
you
got
my
letter
your
father
thinks
i
make
a
fuss
about
nothing
and
cuthbert
and
guy
do
nothing
but
laugh
at
me
as
if
they
could
possibly
know
but
you
always
understand
me
frank
i
knew
it
was
just
as
good
as
sending
for
a
brother
of
my
own
indeed
better
said
mrs
wentworth
wiping
her
eyes
for
though
gerald
is
using
me
so
badly
i
would
not
expose
him
out
of
his
own
family
or
have
people
making
remarks
oh
not
for
the
world
expose
him
said
the
curate
with
unutterable
astonishment
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
any
complaint
to
make
about
gerald
the
idea
was
so
preposterous
that
frank
wentworth
laughed
but
it
was
not
a
laugh
pleasant
to
hear
oh
frank
if
you
but
knew
all
said
louisa
what
i
have
had
to
put
up
with
for
months
all
my
best
feelings
outraged
and
so
many
things
to
endure
that
were
dreadful
to
think
of
and
i
that
was
always
brought
up
so
differently
but
now
cried
the
poor
little
woman
bursting
into
renewed
tears
it
come
to
such
a
pass
that
it
be
concealed
any
longer
i
think
it
will
break
my
heart
people
will
be
sure
to
say
i
have
been
to
blame
and
how
i
am
ever
to
hold
up
my
head
in
society
and
what
is
to
be
my
name
and
whether
i
am
to
be
considered
a
widow
a
widow
cried
the
perpetual
curate
in
utter
consternation
or
worse
sobbed
gerald
poor
little
wife
it
feels
like
being
divorced
as
if
one
had
done
something
wrong
and
i
am
sure
i
never
did
anything
to
deserve
it
but
when
your
husband
is
a
romish
priest
cried
the
afflicted
woman
pressing
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
i
would
just
ask
anybody
what
are
you
you
ca
be
his
wife
because
he
is
not
allowed
to
have
any
wife
and
you
ca
go
back
to
your
maiden
name
because
of
the
children
and
how
can
you
have
any
place
in
society
oh
frank
i
think
i
shall
go
distracted
said
poor
louisa
it
will
feel
as
if
one
had
done
something
wicked
and
been
put
out
of
the
pale
how
can
i
be
called
mrs
wentworth
any
more
when
my
husband
has
left
me
and
even
if
he
is
a
priest
and
ca
have
any
wife
still
he
will
be
alive
and
i
shall
not
have
the
satisfaction
of
being
a
widow
even
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
i
say
she
concluded
with
a
fresh
outburst
for
to
be
a
widow
would
be
a
poor
satisfaction
and
i
do
know
how
i
could
ever
ever
live
without
gerald
but
to
feel
as
if
you
were
an
improper
person
and
all
the
children
prospects
in
life
oh
frank
cried
the
weeping
louisa
burying
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
i
think
i
shall
go
distracted
and
my
heart
will
break
to
all
this
strange
and
unexpected
revelation
the
startled
curate
listened
like
a
man
in
a
dream
possibly
his
representation
of
this
danger
as
seen
entirely
from
her
own
point
of
view
had
a
more
alarming
effect
upon
him
that
any
other
statement
of
the
case
he
could
have
gone
into
gerald
difficulties
with
so
much
sympathy
and
that
the
shock
would
have
been
trifling
in
comparison
and
between
rome
and
the
highest
level
of
anglicanism
there
was
no
such
difference
as
to
frighten
the
accustomed
mind
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
but
seen
from
louisa
side
matters
appeared
very
different
here
the
foundations
of
the
earth
were
shaking
and
life
itself
going
to
pieces
even
the
absurdity
of
her
distress
made
the
whole
business
more
real
and
the
poor
little
woman
whose
trouble
was
that
she
herself
would
neither
be
a
wife
nor
a
widow
had
enough
of
truth
on
her
side
to
unfold
a
miserable
picture
to
the
eyes
of
the
anxious
spectator
he
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
her
and
perhaps
it
was
a
greater
consolation
to
poor
louisa
to
be
permitted
to
run
on
and
you
know
it
never
needed
to
have
come
to
this
if
gerald
had
been
like
other
people
she
said
drying
her
tears
and
with
a
tone
of
remonstrance
of
course
it
is
a
family
living
and
it
is
not
likely
his
own
father
would
have
made
any
disturbance
and
there
is
no
other
family
in
the
parish
but
the
skipwiths
and
they
are
great
friends
and
never
would
have
said
a
word
he
might
have
preached
in
six
surplices
if
he
had
liked
cried
poor
louisa
who
would
have
minded
and
as
for
confession
and
all
that
i
do
believe
there
is
anybody
in
the
world
who
had
done
any
wrong
that
could
have
helped
confessing
to
gerald
he
is
so
good
oh
frank
you
know
he
is
so
good
said
the
exasperated
little
wife
overcome
with
fondness
and
admiration
and
impatience
and
there
is
nobody
in
the
parish
that
i
ever
heard
of
that
does
not
worship
him
but
when
i
tell
him
so
he
never
pays
the
least
attention
and
then
edward
plumstead
and
he
go
on
talking
about
subscription
and
signing
articles
and
nonsense
till
they
make
my
head
swim
nobody
i
am
sure
wants
gerald
to
subscribe
or
sign
articles
i
am
sure
i
would
subscribe
any
amount
cried
the
poor
little
woman
once
more
falling
into
tears
a
thousand
pounds
if
i
had
it
frank
only
to
make
him
hear
reason
for
why
should
he
leave
wentworth
where
he
can
do
what
he
likes
and
nobody
will
interfere
with
him
the
bishop
is
an
old
friend
of
my
father
and
i
am
sure
he
never
would
say
anything
and
as
for
candles
and
crosses
and
anything
he
pleases
frank
here
poor
louisa
paused
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
looked
up
wistfully
into
his
face
she
wanted
to
convince
herself
that
she
was
right
and
that
the
faltering
dread
she
had
behind
all
this
of
something
more
mysterious
than
candles
or
crosses
something
which
she
did
not
attempt
to
understand
was
no
real
spectre
after
all
oh
frank
i
am
sure
i
never
would
oppose
him
nor
your
father
nor
anybody
and
why
should
he
go
and
take
some
dreadful
step
and
upset
everything
said
mrs
wentworth
oh
frank
we
will
not
even
have
enough
to
live
upon
and
as
for
me
if
gerald
leaves
me
how
shall
i
ever
hold
up
my
head
again
or
how
will
anybody
know
how
to
behave
to
me
i
ca
call
myself
miss
leighton
again
after
being
married
so
long
and
if
i
am
not
his
wife
what
shall
i
be
her
crying
became
hysterical
as
she
came
back
to
this
point
and
mr
wentworth
sat
by
her
trying
to
soothe
her
as
wretched
as
herself
but
i
must
see
gerald
louisa
said
the
curate
he
has
never
written
to
me
about
this
perhaps
things
have
not
gone
so
far
as
you
think
but
as
for
the
crosses
and
the
candles
you
know
and
not
being
interfered
with
i
would
promise
to
do
anything
he
likes
cried
the
weeping
woman
i
never
would
worry
him
any
more
about
anything
after
aunt
leonora
was
here
perhaps
i
said
things
i
should
not
have
said
but
oh
frank
whatever
he
likes
to
do
i
am
sure
i
will
give
in
to
it
i
mind
seeing
him
preach
in
his
surplice
only
you
know
poor
papa
was
so
and
as
for
the
candles
what
are
they
to
pleasing
one
husband
oh
frank
if
you
would
only
tell
him
i
ca
argue
about
things
like
a
man
tell
him
nobody
will
ever
interfere
and
he
shall
do
whatever
he
pleases
i
trust
to
you
to
say
said
the
poor
wife
you
can
reason
with
him
and
explain
things
nobody
understands
gerald
like
you
you
will
not
forsake
me
in
my
trouble
frank
i
thought
immediately
of
you
i
knew
you
could
help
us
if
anybody
could
you
will
tell
him
all
i
have
said
she
continued
rising
as
mr
wentworth
rose
and
going
after
him
to
the
door
to
impress
once
more
upon
him
the
necessities
of
the
case
oh
frank
remember
how
much
depends
upon
it
everything
in
the
world
for
me
and
all
the
children
prospects
in
life
and
he
would
be
miserable
himself
if
he
were
to
leave
us
you
know
he
would
said
louisa
looking
anxiously
into
his
face
and
putting
her
hand
on
his
arm
oh
frank
you
do
think
gerald
could
be
happy
without
the
children
and
me
the
terrible
thought
silenced
her
she
stopped
crying
and
a
kind
of
tearless
horror
and
dread
came
over
her
face
she
was
not
very
wise
but
her
heart
was
tender
and
full
of
love
in
its
way
what
if
perhaps
this
life
which
had
gone
so
smoothly
over
her
unthinking
head
without
any
complications
should
turn
out
to
be
a
lie
and
her
happiness
a
mere
delusion
she
could
not
have
put
her
thoughts
into
words
but
the
doubt
suddenly
came
over
her
putting
a
stop
to
all
her
lamentations
if
perhaps
gerald
be
happy
without
the
children
and
herself
what
dreadful
fiction
had
all
her
joy
been
built
upon
such
an
inarticulate
terror
seemed
to
stop
the
very
beating
of
her
heart
it
was
not
a
great
calamity
only
but
an
overthrowal
of
all
confidence
in
life
and
she
shivered
before
it
like
a
dumb
creature
piteously
beholding
an
approaching
agony
which
it
could
not
comprehend
the
utterance
of
her
distress
was
arrested
upon
her
lips
she
looked
up
to
her
brother
with
an
entreating
look
so
suddenly
intensified
and
grown
desperate
that
he
was
startled
by
it
it
alarmed
him
so
much
that
he
turned
again
to
lead
her
back
to
her
sofa
wondering
what
momentary
passion
it
could
be
which
had
woke
such
a
sudden
world
of
confused
meaning
in
louisa
eyes
you
may
be
sure
he
could
not
said
the
curate
warmly
not
happy
certainly
but
to
men
like
gerald
there
are
things
in
the
world
dearer
than
happiness
he
said
after
a
little
pause
with
a
sigh
wondering
to
himself
whether
if
lucy
wodehouse
were
his
his
dearest
duty
could
make
him
consent
to
part
with
her
if
he
thinks
of
such
a
step
he
must
think
of
it
as
of
martyrdom
is
that
a
comfort
to
you
he
continued
bending
in
his
pity
and
wonder
over
the
trembling
wife
who
burst
forth
into
fresh
tears
as
he
spoke
and
forgot
her
momentary
horror
oh
frank
go
and
speak
to
him
and
tell
him
how
miserable
i
am
and
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
tell
him
everything
frank
oh
leave
him
till
you
have
persuaded
him
go
go
never
mind
me
cried
mrs
wentworth
and
then
she
went
to
the
door
after
him
once
more
do
say
i
sent
for
you
he
he
might
not
be
pleased
she
said
in
her
faltering
eager
voice
and
oh
frank
consider
how
much
hangs
upon
what
you
say
when
he
left
her
louisa
stood
at
the
door
watching
him
as
he
went
along
the
passage
towards
her
husband
room
it
was
a
but
still
the
unreasoning
uncomprehending
heart
took
a
little
comfort
from
it
she
watched
his
figure
disappearing
along
the
narrow
passage
with
a
thrill
of
mingled
anxiety
and
hope
arguing
with
gerald
though
it
was
so
ineffectual
when
she
tried
it
might
still
be
of
some
avail
in
stronger
hands
his
brother
understood
him
and
could
talk
to
him
better
than
anybody
else
could
and
though
she
had
never
convinced
anybody
of
anything
all
her
life
mrs
wentworth
had
an
inalienable
confidence
in
the
effect
of
being
talked
to
in
the
momentary
stimulus
she
went
back
to
her
darkened
room
and
drew
up
the
blind
and
went
to
work
in
a
tremulous
way
but
as
the
slow
time
went
on
and
frank
did
not
return
poor
louisa
courage
failed
her
her
fingers
refused
their
office
and
she
began
to
imagine
all
sorts
of
things
that
might
be
going
on
in
gerald
study
perhaps
the
argument
might
be
going
the
wrong
way
perhaps
gerald
might
be
angry
at
his
brother
interference
perhaps
they
might
come
to
words
they
who
had
been
such
good
friends
and
it
would
be
her
fault
she
jumped
up
with
her
heart
beating
loud
when
she
heard
a
door
opened
somewhere
but
when
nobody
came
grew
sick
and
faint
and
hid
her
face
in
the
impatience
of
her
misery
then
the
feeling
grew
upon
her
that
those
precious
moments
were
decisive
and
that
she
must
make
one
last
appeal
or
her
heart
would
burst
she
tried
to
resist
the
impulse
in
a
feeble
way
but
it
was
not
her
custom
to
resist
impulses
and
it
got
the
better
of
her
and
this
was
why
poor
louisa
rushed
into
the
library
just
as
frank
thought
he
had
made
a
little
advance
in
his
pleading
and
scattered
his
eloquence
to
the
winds
with
a
set
of
dreadful
arguments
which
were
all
her
own
chapter
xvi
the
curate
of
st
roque
found
his
brother
in
his
library
looking
very
much
as
he
always
looked
at
first
glance
but
gerald
was
not
reading
nor
writing
nor
doing
anything
he
was
seated
in
his
usual
chair
by
his
usual
table
with
all
the
ordinary
things
around
some
manuscript
lying
loosely
about
and
looking
as
if
he
had
thrown
down
his
pen
in
disgust
and
pushed
it
away
from
him
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
was
on
the
table
and
an
open
book
in
his
other
hand
but
neither
the
book
nor
the
manuscript
occupied
him
he
was
sitting
leaning
his
head
in
his
hands
gazing
blankly
out
through
the
window
as
it
appeared
at
the
cedar
which
flung
its
serene
shadow
over
the
lawn
outside
he
jumped
up
at
the
sound
of
his
brother
voice
but
seemed
to
recall
himself
with
a
little
difficulty
even
for
that
and
did
not
look
much
surprised
to
see
him
in
short
frank
read
in
gerald
eyes
that
he
would
not
at
that
moment
have
been
surprised
to
see
any
one
and
that
in
his
own
consciousness
the
emergency
was
great
enough
to
justify
any
appearance
though
it
might
be
from
heaven
or
from
the
grave
i
am
glad
you
have
come
he
said
after
they
had
greeted
each
other
his
mouth
relaxing
ever
so
slightly
into
the
ghost
of
his
old
smile
you
and
i
always
understood
each
other
and
it
appears
i
want
interpretation
now
and
one
interpretation
supposes
many
he
said
with
a
gleam
half
of
pathos
half
of
amusement
lighting
up
his
face
for
a
moment
there
is
no
such
thing
as
accepting
a
simple
version
even
of
one
man
thoughts
you
have
come
at
a
very
fit
time
frank
that
is
for
me
i
am
glad
you
think
so
said
the
other
brother
and
then
there
was
a
pause
neither
liking
to
enter
upon
the
grand
subject
which
stood
between
them
have
you
seen
louisa
said
gerald
he
spoke
like
a
man
who
was
ill
in
a
preoccupied
interrupted
way
like
a
sick
man
he
was
occupied
with
himself
with
the
train
of
thought
which
was
always
going
on
in
his
mind
whatever
he
might
be
doing
whether
he
was
working
or
resting
alone
or
in
company
for
months
back
he
had
carried
it
with
him
everywhere
the
outside
upon
which
his
thoughtful
eyes
fell
as
he
looked
straight
before
him
out
of
the
library
window
was
all
garlanded
with
the
reasonings
and
questionings
of
this
painful
spring
to
frank
eyes
gerald
attention
was
fixed
upon
the
fluttering
of
a
certain
twig
at
the
extremity
of
one
of
those
broad
solemn
immovable
branches
gerald
however
saw
not
the
twig
but
one
of
his
hardest
difficulties
which
was
twined
and
twined
in
the
most
inextricable
way
round
that
little
sombre
cluster
of
spikes
and
so
kept
looking
out
not
at
the
cedar
but
at
the
whole
confused
yet
distinct
array
of
his
own
troubled
thoughts
if
you
have
seen
louisa
she
has
been
talking
to
you
no
doubt
he
said
after
another
little
pause
with
again
the
glimmer
of
a
smile
we
have
fallen
upon
troubles
and
we
do
understand
each
other
frank
that
all
very
natural
she
does
not
see
things
from
my
point
of
view
i
could
not
expect
she
should
if
i
could
see
from
hers
it
might
be
easier
for
us
all
but
that
is
still
less
to
be
expected
and
it
is
hard
upon
her
frank
very
hard
said
gerald
turning
round
in
his
old
ingenuous
way
with
that
faculty
for
seeing
other
people
difficulties
which
was
so
strong
a
point
in
his
character
she
is
called
upon
to
make
after
all
perhaps
the
greater
sacrifice
of
the
two
and
she
does
not
see
any
duty
in
it
the
reverse
indeed
she
thinks
it
a
sin
it
is
a
strange
view
of
life
to
look
at
it
from
louisa
point
here
will
be
an
unwilling
unintentional
martyrdom
and
it
is
hard
to
think
i
should
take
all
the
merit
and
leave
my
poor
little
wife
the
suffering
without
any
compensation
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
uneasy
steps
as
if
the
thought
was
painful
and
had
to
be
got
rid
of
by
some
sudden
movement
it
must
be
that
god
reckons
with
women
for
what
they
have
endured
as
with
men
for
what
they
have
done
said
gerald
he
spoke
with
a
kind
of
grieved
certainty
which
made
his
brother
feel
to
start
with
the
hopelessness
of
all
argument
but
must
this
be
is
it
necessary
to
take
such
a
final
such
a
terrible
step
said
the
perpetual
curate
i
think
so
gerald
went
to
the
window
to
resume
his
contemplation
of
the
cedar
and
stood
there
with
his
back
turned
to
frank
and
his
eyes
going
slowly
over
all
the
long
processes
of
his
laid
up
as
they
were
upon
those
solemn
levels
of
shadow
yes
you
have
gone
so
far
with
me
but
i
do
want
to
take
you
any
farther
frank
perhaps
when
i
have
reached
the
perfect
peace
to
which
i
am
looking
forward
i
may
try
to
induce
you
to
share
it
but
at
present
there
are
so
many
pricks
of
the
flesh
you
did
not
come
to
argue
with
me
did
you
and
again
the
gleam
of
old
came
over
gerald
face
as
he
looked
round
louisa
believes
in
arguing
he
said
as
he
came
back
to
the
table
and
took
his
seat
again
not
that
she
has
ever
gained
much
by
it
so
far
as
i
am
aware
poor
girl
she
talks
and
talks
and
fancies
she
is
persuading
me
and
all
the
time
my
heart
is
bleeding
for
her
there
it
is
he
exclaimed
suddenly
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
this
is
what
crushes
one
to
think
of
the
rest
is
hard
enough
heaven
knows
separation
from
my
friends
giving
up
my
own
people
wounding
and
grieving
as
i
know
i
shall
everybody
who
loves
me
i
could
bear
that
but
louisa
and
her
children
god
help
me
there
the
sting
they
were
both
men
and
strong
men
not
likely
to
fall
into
any
sentimental
weakness
but
something
between
a
groan
and
a
sob
wrung
out
of
the
heart
of
the
elder
brother
at
the
thought
of
the
terrible
sacrifice
before
him
echoed
with
a
hard
sound
of
anguish
into
the
quiet
it
was
very
different
from
his
wife
trembling
weeping
hoping
agony
but
it
reduced
the
curate
more
than
ever
to
that
position
of
spectator
which
he
felt
was
so
very
far
from
the
active
part
which
his
poor
sister
expected
of
him
i
do
know
by
what
steps
you
have
reached
this
conclusion
said
frank
wentworth
but
even
if
you
feel
it
your
duty
to
give
up
the
anglican
church
in
which
of
course
i
think
you
totally
wrong
added
the
high
churchman
in
a
parenthesis
i
can
not
see
why
you
are
bound
to
abandon
all
duties
whatever
i
have
not
come
to
argue
with
you
i
daresay
poor
louisa
may
expect
it
of
me
but
i
ca
and
you
know
very
well
i
ca
i
should
like
to
know
how
it
has
come
about
all
the
same
but
one
thing
only
gerald
a
man
may
be
a
christian
without
being
a
priest
louisa
hush
i
am
a
priest
or
nothing
i
ca
relinquish
my
life
cried
the
elder
brother
lifting
his
hands
suddenly
as
if
to
thrust
away
something
which
threatened
him
then
he
rose
up
again
and
went
towards
the
window
and
his
cedar
which
stood
dark
in
the
sunshine
slightly
fluttered
at
its
extremities
by
the
light
but
throwing
glorious
level
lines
of
shadow
which
the
wind
could
not
disturb
upon
the
grass
the
limes
near
and
that
one
delicate
feathery
birch
which
was
mrs
wentworth
pride
had
all
some
interest
of
their
own
on
hand
and
went
on
waving
rustling
coquetting
with
the
breezes
and
the
sunshine
in
a
way
which
precluded
any
arbitrary
line
of
shade
but
the
cedar
stood
immovable
like
a
verdant
monument
sweeping
its
long
level
branches
over
the
lawn
passive
under
the
light
and
indifferent
except
at
its
very
tops
and
edges
to
the
breeze
if
there
had
been
any
human
sentiment
in
that
spectator
of
the
ways
of
man
how
it
must
have
groaned
and
trembled
under
the
pitiless
weight
of
thoughts
the
sad
lines
of
discussion
and
argument
and
doubt
which
were
entangled
in
its
branches
gerald
wentworth
went
to
his
window
to
refer
to
it
as
if
it
were
a
book
in
which
all
his
contests
had
been
recorded
the
thrill
of
the
air
in
it
tingled
through
him
as
he
stood
looking
out
and
there
without
looking
at
frank
except
now
and
then
for
a
moment
when
he
got
excited
with
his
subject
he
went
into
the
history
of
his
struggle
a
history
not
unprecedented
or
unparalleled
such
as
has
been
told
to
the
world
before
now
by
men
who
have
gone
through
it
in
various
shapes
with
various
amounts
of
sophistry
and
simplicity
but
it
is
a
different
thing
reading
of
such
a
conflict
in
a
book
and
hearing
it
from
lips
pallid
with
the
meaning
of
the
words
they
uttered
and
a
heart
which
was
about
to
prove
its
sincerity
by
voluntary
pangs
more
hard
than
death
frank
wentworth
listened
to
his
brother
with
a
great
deal
of
agreement
in
what
he
said
and
again
with
an
acute
perception
of
mistakes
on
gerald
part
and
vehement
impulses
of
contradiction
to
which
at
the
same
time
it
was
impossible
to
give
utterance
for
there
was
something
very
solemn
in
the
account
he
was
giving
of
himself
as
he
stood
with
his
face
half
turned
to
the
anxious
listener
leaning
on
the
window
looking
into
the
cedar
gerald
did
not
leave
any
room
for
argument
or
remonstrance
he
told
his
brother
how
he
had
been
led
from
one
step
to
another
without
any
lingering
touch
of
possibility
in
the
narrative
that
he
might
be
induced
to
retrace
again
that
painful
way
it
was
a
path
once
trod
never
to
be
returned
upon
and
already
he
stood
steadfast
at
the
end
looking
back
mournfully
yet
with
a
strange
composure
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
mixture
of
love
admiration
impatience
even
intolerance
which
swelled
through
the
mind
of
the
spectator
as
he
looked
on
at
this
wonderful
sight
nor
how
hard
he
found
it
to
restrain
the
interruptions
which
rushed
to
his
lips
the
eager
arguments
which
came
upon
him
in
a
flood
all
his
own
favourite
fences
against
the
overflow
of
the
tide
which
ran
in
lawful
bounds
in
his
own
mind
but
which
had
inundated
his
brother
but
though
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
keep
silence
it
was
altogether
impossible
to
break
in
upon
history
of
this
great
battle
through
which
he
had
just
come
he
come
through
it
it
was
plain
the
warfare
was
accomplished
the
weapons
hung
up
the
conflict
over
and
nothing
could
be
more
apparent
than
that
he
had
no
intention
of
entering
the
again
when
he
had
ended
there
was
another
pause
i
am
not
going
to
argue
with
you
said
frank
wentworth
i
do
even
need
to
tell
you
that
i
am
grieved
to
the
heart
it
is
so
very
many
years
ago
said
the
younger
brother
almost
too
much
touched
by
the
recollection
to
preserve
his
composure
since
i
took
all
my
opinions
from
you
and
since
the
time
came
for
independent
action
i
too
have
gone
over
all
this
ground
my
conclusions
have
been
very
different
from
yours
gerald
i
see
you
are
convinced
and
i
can
say
nothing
but
they
do
not
convince
me
you
do
not
convince
me
nor
the
sight
of
your
faith
though
that
is
the
most
touching
of
all
arguments
will
you
go
back
and
go
over
it
again
said
the
curate
spurred
by
a
thought
of
poor
louisa
to
contradict
himself
while
the
words
were
still
on
his
lips
no
said
gerald
it
would
be
of
no
use
frank
we
should
only
grieve
each
other
more
then
i
give
up
that
subject
said
the
younger
brother
but
there
is
one
matter
which
i
must
go
back
to
you
may
go
to
rome
and
cease
to
be
a
priest
of
the
anglican
church
but
you
can
not
cease
to
be
a
man
to
bear
the
weight
of
your
natural
duties
do
turn
away
but
hear
me
gerald
louisa
do
say
any
more
do
you
imagine
i
have
not
thought
of
that
said
gerald
once
more
with
a
gesture
of
pain
and
something
like
terror
i
have
put
my
hand
to
the
plough
and
i
can
not
go
back
if
i
am
not
a
priest
i
am
nothing
but
when
he
came
to
that
point
his
no
longer
gave
him
any
assistance
he
came
back
to
his
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
louisa
is
your
wife
you
are
not
like
a
man
free
from
the
bonds
of
nature
said
the
curate
of
st
roque
it
is
not
for
me
to
speak
of
the
love
between
you
but
i
hold
it
as
the
scripture
says
for
a
holy
mystery
like
the
love
of
christ
for
his
church
the
most
sacred
of
all
bonds
said
the
young
man
with
a
certain
touch
of
awe
and
emotion
as
became
a
young
man
and
a
true
lover
he
made
a
little
pause
to
regain
command
of
himself
before
he
continued
and
she
is
dependent
on
you
outwardly
for
all
the
comfort
of
her
life
and
in
her
heart
for
everything
gerald
i
do
not
comprehend
what
that
duty
is
which
could
make
you
leave
her
all
helpless
and
tender
as
you
know
her
to
be
upon
the
mercies
of
the
world
she
herself
says
and
poor
louisa
complaint
grew
into
pathos
under
the
subliming
force
of
her
advocate
sympathy
that
she
would
be
like
a
widow
and
worse
than
a
widow
i
am
not
the
man
to
bid
you
suppress
your
convictions
because
they
will
be
your
ruin
in
the
common
sense
of
the
word
but
gerald
your
wife
gerald
had
bent
his
head
down
upon
his
clasped
hands
sometimes
a
great
heave
of
his
frame
showed
the
last
struggle
that
was
going
on
within
him
a
struggle
more
painful
more
profound
than
anything
that
had
gone
before
and
the
voice
of
the
curate
who
like
his
brother
was
nothing
if
not
a
priest
was
choked
and
painful
with
the
force
of
his
emotion
he
drew
his
breath
hard
between
his
words
it
was
not
an
argument
but
an
admonition
an
appeal
not
from
a
brother
only
but
from
one
who
spoke
with
authority
as
feeling
himself
accredited
from
god
he
drew
closer
towards
the
voluntary
martyr
beside
him
the
humbleness
of
his
reverential
love
for
his
elder
brother
mingling
in
that
voice
of
the
priest
which
was
natural
to
him
and
which
he
did
not
scruple
to
adopt
gerald
your
wife
he
said
in
softened
but
firm
tones
laying
his
hand
on
his
brother
arm
and
it
was
at
this
moment
when
in
his
heart
he
felt
that
his
influence
might
be
of
some
avail
and
when
all
the
powers
of
his
mind
were
gathering
to
bear
upon
this
last
experiment
that
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
poor
louisa
all
flushed
and
tearful
in
womanish
hot
impatience
and
misery
that
knew
no
prudence
burst
without
any
warning
into
the
room
i
ca
bear
it
any
longer
cried
the
poor
wife
i
knew
you
were
talking
it
all
over
and
deciding
what
it
was
to
be
and
when
life
is
hanging
on
a
chance
how
can
one
keep
quiet
and
not
interfere
oh
gerald
gerald
i
have
been
a
true
wife
to
you
i
know
i
am
not
clever
but
i
would
have
died
to
do
you
any
good
you
are
not
going
to
forsake
me
cried
poor
louisa
going
up
to
him
and
putting
her
arms
round
him
i
said
frank
was
to
tell
you
everything
but
a
man
can
never
tell
what
is
in
a
woman
heart
oh
gerald
why
should
you
go
and
kill
me
i
will
never
oppose
you
any
more
whatever
you
want
i
will
give
in
to
it
as
freely
as
if
it
were
my
own
way
i
will
make
my
own
way
gerald
if
you
will
only
listen
to
me
whatever
changes
you
please
oh
gerald
i
will
never
say
a
word
nor
your
father
nor
any
one
if
the
bishop
should
interfere
we
would
all
stand
up
for
you
there
is
not
a
soul
in
wentworth
to
oppose
you
know
there
is
not
put
anything
you
please
in
the
church
preach
how
you
please
light
the
candles
or
anything
gerald
you
know
it
is
true
i
am
saying
i
am
not
trying
to
deceive
you
cried
the
poor
soul
bewildered
in
her
folly
and
her
grief
no
louisa
no
only
you
do
understand
said
her
husband
with
a
groan
he
had
raised
his
head
and
was
looking
at
her
with
a
hopeless
gleam
of
impatience
in
the
pity
and
anguish
of
his
eyes
he
took
her
little
hand
and
held
it
between
his
own
which
were
trembling
with
all
this
strain
her
little
tender
helpless
woman
hand
formed
only
for
soft
occupations
and
softer
caresses
it
was
not
a
hand
which
could
help
a
man
in
such
an
emergency
it
was
without
any
grasp
in
it
to
take
hold
upon
him
or
force
of
love
to
part
a
clinging
impotent
hand
such
as
holds
down
but
can
not
raise
up
he
held
it
in
a
close
tremulous
pressure
as
she
stood
looking
down
upon
him
questioning
him
with
eager
hopeful
eyes
and
taking
comfort
in
her
ignorance
from
his
silence
and
the
way
in
which
he
held
her
poor
louisa
concluded
she
was
yet
to
win
the
day
i
will
turn
puseyite
too
she
said
with
a
strange
little
touch
of
attempted
laughter
i
do
want
to
have
any
opinions
different
from
my
husband
and
you
do
think
your
father
is
likely
to
do
anything
to
drive
you
out
of
the
church
you
have
only
given
us
a
terrible
fright
dear
she
continued
beginning
to
tremble
again
as
he
shook
his
head
and
turned
away
from
her
you
did
not
really
mean
such
a
dreadful
thing
as
sending
away
you
could
not
do
without
me
gerald
you
know
you
could
not
her
breath
was
getting
short
her
heart
quickening
in
its
throbs
the
smile
that
was
quivering
on
her
face
got
no
response
from
her
husband
downcast
eyes
and
then
poor
louisa
lost
all
her
courage
she
threw
herself
down
at
his
feet
kneeling
to
him
oh
gerald
it
is
not
because
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
you
are
not
doing
it
for
that
if
you
do
stay
in
the
rectory
we
shall
be
ruined
we
shall
not
have
enough
to
eat
and
the
rectory
will
go
to
frank
and
your
children
will
be
cast
upon
the
world
and
what
oh
what
is
it
for
unless
it
is
to
get
rid
of
me
cried
mrs
wentworth
you
could
have
as
much
freedom
as
you
like
here
at
your
own
living
nobody
would
ever
interfere
or
say
what
are
you
doing
and
the
bishop
is
papa
old
friend
oh
gerald
be
wise
in
time
and
do
throw
away
all
our
happiness
for
a
fancy
if
it
was
anything
that
could
not
be
arranged
i
would
not
mind
so
much
but
if
we
all
promise
to
give
in
to
you
and
that
you
shall
do
what
you
please
and
nobody
will
interfere
how
can
you
have
the
heart
to
make
us
all
so
wretched
we
will
not
even
be
respectable
said
the
weeping
woman
a
family
without
any
father
and
a
wife
without
her
husband
and
he
living
all
the
time
oh
gerald
though
i
think
i
surely
might
be
considered
as
much
as
candles
have
the
altar
covered
with
lights
if
you
wish
it
and
if
you
never
took
off
your
surplice
any
more
i
would
never
say
a
word
you
can
do
all
that
and
stay
in
the
rectory
you
have
not
the
heart
surely
surely
you
have
not
the
heart
all
for
an
idea
of
your
own
to
bring
this
terrible
distress
upon
the
children
and
me
god
help
us
all
said
gerald
with
a
sigh
of
despair
as
he
lifted
her
up
sobbing
in
a
hysterical
fit
and
laid
her
on
the
sofa
he
had
to
stand
by
her
side
for
a
long
time
holding
her
hand
and
soothing
her
with
deeper
and
deeper
shadows
growing
over
his
face
as
for
frank
after
pacing
the
room
in
great
agitation
for
some
time
after
trying
to
interpose
and
failing
he
went
away
in
a
fever
of
impatience
and
distress
into
the
garden
wondering
whether
he
could
ever
find
means
to
take
up
the
broken
thread
and
urge
again
upon
his
brother
the
argument
which
but
for
this
fatal
interruption
he
thought
might
have
moved
him
but
gathering
thoughts
came
thick
upon
the
perpetual
curate
he
did
not
go
back
to
make
another
attempt
even
when
he
knew
by
the
sounds
through
the
open
windows
that
louisa
had
been
led
to
her
own
room
he
stood
outside
and
looked
at
the
troubled
house
which
seemed
to
stand
so
serene
and
secure
in
the
sunshine
who
could
have
supposed
that
it
was
torn
asunder
in
such
a
hopeless
fashion
and
louisa
suggestion
came
into
his
mind
and
drove
him
wild
with
a
sense
of
horror
and
involuntary
guilt
as
though
he
had
been
conspiring
against
them
the
rectory
will
go
to
frank
was
it
his
fault
that
at
that
moment
a
vision
of
lucy
wodehouse
sweet
and
strong
and
steadfast
a
delicate
firm
figure
on
which
a
man
could
lean
in
his
trouble
suddenly
rose
up
before
the
curate
eyes
fair
as
the
vision
was
he
would
have
banished
it
if
he
could
and
hated
himself
for
being
capable
of
conjuring
it
up
at
such
a
time
was
it
for
him
to
profit
by
the
great
calamity
which
would
make
his
brother
house
desolate
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
nor
himself
for
finding
it
possible
and
he
was
ashamed
to
look
in
gerald
face
with
even
the
shadow
of
such
an
imagination
on
his
own
he
tapped
at
the
library
window
after
a
while
and
told
his
brother
that
he
was
going
up
to
the
hall
louisa
had
gone
and
her
husband
sat
once
more
vacant
yet
occupied
by
his
i
will
follow
you
presently
said
gerald
speak
to
my
father
without
any
hesitation
frank
it
is
better
to
have
it
over
while
we
are
all
together
for
it
must
be
concluded
now
and
the
curate
saw
in
the
shadow
of
the
dim
apartment
that
his
brother
lifted
from
the
table
the
grand
emblem
of
all
anguish
and
victory
and
pressed
upon
it
his
pale
lips
the
young
man
turned
away
with
the
shadow
of
that
cross
standing
black
between
him
and
the
sunshine
his
heart
ached
at
the
sight
of
the
symbol
most
sacred
and
most
dear
in
the
world
in
an
agony
of
grief
and
impatience
he
went
away
sadly
through
the
familiar
road
to
his
father
house
here
had
he
to
stand
by
and
see
this
sacrifice
accomplished
this
was
all
that
had
come
of
his
mission
of
consolation
and
help
chapter
xvii
the
curate
of
st
roque
went
sadly
along
the
road
he
knew
so
well
from
wentworth
rectory
to
the
hall
there
was
scarcely
a
tree
nor
the
turning
of
a
hedgerow
which
had
not
its
own
individual
memories
to
the
son
of
the
soil
here
he
had
come
to
meet
gerald
returning
from
eton
coming
back
from
the
university
in
later
days
here
he
had
rushed
down
to
the
old
rector
his
childless
uncle
with
the
copy
of
the
when
his
brother
took
his
gerald
and
the
family
pride
in
him
was
interwoven
with
the
very
path
and
now
the
young
man
pressed
on
to
the
hall
with
a
certain
bitter
moisture
stealing
to
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
felt
indignant
and
aggrieved
in
his
love
not
at
gerald
but
at
the
causes
which
were
conspiring
to
detach
him
from
his
natural
sphere
and
duties
when
he
recollected
how
he
had
himself
dallied
with
the
same
thoughts
he
grew
angry
with
his
brother
nobleness
and
purity
which
never
could
see
less
than
its
highest
ideal
soul
in
anything
and
with
a
certain
fierce
fit
of
truth
glanced
back
at
his
own
easter
lilies
and
choristers
feeling
involuntarily
that
he
would
like
to
tear
off
the
flowers
and
surplices
and
tread
them
under
his
feet
why
was
it
that
he
an
inferior
man
should
be
able
to
confine
himself
to
the
mere
accessories
which
pleased
his
fancy
and
could
judge
and
reject
the
dangerous
principles
beneath
while
gerald
the
loftier
purer
intelligence
should
get
so
hopelessly
lost
in
mazes
of
sophistry
and
false
argument
to
the
peril
of
his
work
his
life
and
all
that
he
could
ever
know
of
happiness
such
were
the
thoughts
that
passed
through
the
mind
of
the
perpetual
curate
as
he
went
rapidly
through
the
winding
going
home
perhaps
he
was
wrong
in
thinking
that
gerald
was
thus
superior
to
himself
but
the
error
was
a
generous
one
and
the
curate
held
it
in
simplicity
and
with
all
his
heart
before
he
reached
the
house
he
saw
his
father
walking
under
the
which
formed
a
kind
of
lateral
aisle
to
the
great
avenue
which
was
one
of
the
boasts
of
the
wentworths
the
squire
was
like
most
squires
of
no
particular
character
a
hale
ruddy
man
looking
his
full
age
but
retaining
all
the
vigour
of
his
youth
he
was
not
a
man
of
any
intellect
to
speak
of
nor
did
he
pretend
to
it
but
he
had
that
glimmering
of
sense
which
keeps
many
a
stupid
man
straight
and
a
certain
amount
of
natural
sensibility
and
consideration
for
other
people
feelings
which
made
persons
who
knew
no
better
give
mr
wentworth
credit
for
tact
a
quality
unknown
to
him
he
was
walking
slowly
in
a
perplexed
manner
under
the
they
were
all
in
glorious
blossom
filling
the
air
with
that
mingling
sense
of
fragrance
and
music
which
is
the
soul
of
the
murmurous
tree
but
the
short
figure
of
the
squire
in
his
with
his
perplexed
looks
was
not
at
all
an
accessory
in
keeping
with
the
scene
he
was
taking
his
walk
in
a
subdued
way
pondering
something
and
it
puzzled
him
sorely
in
his
straightforward
unprofound
understanding
he
shook
his
head
sometimes
as
he
went
along
sad
and
perplexed
and
unsatisfactory
among
his
limes
he
had
got
a
note
from
gerald
that
morning
and
how
his
son
could
intend
to
give
up
living
and
station
and
wife
and
children
for
anything
in
heaven
or
earth
was
more
than
the
squire
could
understand
he
started
very
much
when
he
heard
voice
calling
to
him
frank
indeed
was
said
to
be
if
any
one
was
the
squire
weakness
in
the
family
he
was
as
clever
as
gerald
and
he
had
the
practical
sense
which
mr
wentworth
prized
as
knowing
himself
to
possess
it
if
he
could
have
wished
for
any
one
in
the
present
emergency
it
would
have
been
frank
and
he
turned
round
overjoyed
frank
my
boy
you
heartily
welcome
home
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
to
him
as
became
a
british
parent
always
welcome
but
particularly
just
now
where
did
you
come
from
how
did
you
come
have
you
eaten
anything
this
morning
it
close
upon
lunch
and
we
go
in
directly
but
my
dear
boy
wait
here
a
moment
if
you
not
particularly
hungry
i
ca
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
you
come
rather
see
you
than
a
hundred
pound
when
frank
had
thanked
him
and
returned
his
greetings
and
answered
his
questions
which
the
squire
had
forgotten
and
made
his
own
inquiries
to
which
mr
wentworth
replied
only
by
a
hasty
nod
and
an
oh
yes
thank
you
all
well
all
well
the
two
came
to
a
momentary
pause
they
had
nothing
particular
to
add
about
their
happiness
in
seeing
each
other
and
as
frank
wrote
to
his
sisters
pretty
regularly
there
was
nothing
to
tell
they
were
quite
free
to
plunge
at
once
as
is
to
british
relatives
under
the
trying
circumstances
of
a
meeting
a
blessed
possibility
into
the
first
great
subject
which
happened
to
be
at
hand
have
you
heard
anything
about
gerald
said
mr
wentworth
abruptly
perhaps
you
called
there
on
your
way
from
the
station
gerald
has
got
into
a
nice
mess
he
wrote
to
tell
me
about
it
and
i
ca
make
head
nor
tail
of
it
do
you
think
he
a
little
touched
here
and
the
squire
tapped
his
own
round
forehead
with
a
troubled
look
no
other
explanation
possible
that
i
can
see
a
good
living
a
nice
house
a
wife
that
just
suits
him
and
it
not
everybody
that
would
suit
gerald
and
a
lot
of
fine
children
and
he
talks
to
me
of
giving
up
everything
as
if
a
man
could
give
up
everything
it
all
very
well
talking
of
and
so
forth
and
if
it
meant
simply
considering
other
people
and
doing
anything
disagreeable
for
anybody
sake
i
do
know
a
man
more
likely
than
my
son
gerald
your
brother
a
fine
fellow
frank
a
noble
sort
of
fellow
though
he
has
his
crotchets
said
the
father
with
a
touch
of
involuntary
pathos
but
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
my
son
a
man
like
gerald
wentworth
has
a
mind
to
throw
away
his
position
and
give
up
all
the
duties
of
his
life
he
ca
do
it
sir
i
tell
you
it
impossible
and
i
wo
believe
it
mr
wentworth
drew
up
his
and
kicked
away
a
fallen
branch
with
his
foot
and
looked
insulted
and
angry
it
was
a
dereliction
of
which
he
would
not
suppose
the
possibility
of
a
wentworth
being
guilty
it
did
not
strike
him
as
a
conflict
between
belief
and
but
on
the
question
of
a
man
abandoning
his
post
whatever
it
might
be
the
head
of
the
house
held
strong
views
i
agree
it
impossible
but
it
looks
as
if
it
were
true
said
the
curate
i
do
understand
it
any
more
than
you
do
but
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
to
address
ourselves
to
the
reality
all
the
same
gerald
has
made
up
his
mind
that
the
church
of
rome
is
the
only
true
church
and
therefore
he
is
in
a
false
position
in
the
church
of
england
he
ca
remain
a
priest
of
the
anglican
communion
with
such
views
any
more
than
a
man
could
fight
against
his
country
or
in
a
wrong
quarrel
but
good
heavens
sir
said
the
squire
interrupting
him
is
it
a
time
to
inquire
into
the
quarrel
when
you
on
the
ground
will
you
tell
me
sir
that
my
son
charley
should
have
gone
into
the
question
between
russia
and
england
when
he
was
before
sebastopol
and
deserted
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
snort
of
infinite
scorn
if
he
found
the
czar
had
right
on
his
side
god
bless
my
soul
striking
at
the
root
of
everything
as
for
the
church
of
rome
antichrist
why
every
child
in
the
village
school
could
tell
you
that
and
if
gerald
entertains
any
such
absurd
ideas
the
thing
for
him
to
do
is
to
read
up
all
that
been
written
on
the
subject
and
get
rid
of
his
doubts
as
soon
as
possible
the
short
and
the
long
of
it
is
said
the
troubled
squire
who
found
it
much
the
easiest
way
to
be
angry
that
you
ask
me
to
believe
that
your
brother
gerald
is
a
fool
and
a
coward
and
i
wo
believe
it
frank
if
you
should
preach
to
me
for
a
year
and
for
my
part
i
would
stake
my
life
on
his
wisdom
and
his
courage
said
the
curate
with
a
little
heat
but
that
is
not
the
question
he
believes
that
truth
and
honour
require
him
to
leave
his
post
there
is
something
more
involved
which
we
might
yet
prevent
i
have
been
trying
but
louisa
interrupted
me
i
do
know
if
you
realise
fully
what
he
intends
gerald
can
not
cease
to
be
a
priest
he
will
become
a
catholic
priest
when
he
ceases
to
be
rector
of
wentworth
and
that
implies
god
bless
my
soul
cried
the
bewildered
squire
he
was
silent
for
a
long
time
after
he
had
uttered
that
benediction
he
took
out
letter
and
read
it
over
while
the
two
walked
on
in
silence
under
the
and
the
paper
shook
in
his
hands
notwithstanding
all
his
steadiness
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
only
after
two
or
three
efforts
to
clear
his
voice
i
ca
make
out
that
he
says
frank
i
do
see
that
what
he
means
said
mr
wentworth
in
a
fainter
tone
than
usual
and
then
he
continued
with
more
agitation
louisa
is
a
dear
good
soul
you
know
but
she
a
bit
of
a
fool
like
most
women
she
always
takes
the
worst
view
if
she
can
get
a
good
cry
out
of
anything
she
will
it
she
that
put
this
fancy
into
your
head
eh
you
do
say
you
had
it
from
gerald
himself
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
by
jove
sir
by
heaven
sir
cried
the
excited
squire
blazing
up
suddenly
in
a
burst
of
passion
he
ca
be
any
son
of
mine
for
any
damnable
papistical
madness
to
give
up
his
wife
why
god
bless
us
he
was
a
man
was
he
before
he
became
a
priest
a
priest
he
not
a
priest
he
a
clergyman
and
the
rector
of
wentworth
i
ca
believe
it
i
wo
believe
it
said
the
head
of
the
house
with
vehemence
tell
me
one
of
my
sons
is
a
sneak
and
a
traitor
and
if
you
were
another
of
my
sons
sir
i
knock
you
down
for
your
pains
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
mr
wentworth
came
full
force
against
a
projecting
branch
which
he
did
not
see
as
he
spoke
these
words
but
though
the
sudden
blow
half
stunned
him
he
did
not
stop
in
his
vehement
contradiction
it
ca
be
i
tell
you
it
ca
it
sha
be
frank
cried
the
squire
he
would
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
curate
anxieties
or
accept
the
arm
frank
offered
though
he
could
not
deny
feeling
faint
and
giddy
after
the
blow
it
took
away
all
the
colour
from
his
ruddy
face
and
left
him
pale
with
a
red
welt
across
his
forehead
and
wonderfully
unlike
himself
confound
it
i
told
miles
to
look
after
that
tree
weeks
ago
if
he
thinks
i
stand
his
carelessness
he
mistaken
said
mr
wentworth
by
way
of
relieving
himself
he
was
a
man
who
always
eased
his
mind
by
being
angry
with
somebody
when
anything
happened
to
put
him
out
my
dear
father
said
the
curate
as
soon
as
it
was
practicable
i
want
you
to
listen
to
me
and
help
me
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
that
i
can
see
gerald
is
in
a
state
of
high
excitement
fit
for
any
martyrdom
we
ca
keep
him
back
from
one
sacrifice
but
by
all
the
force
we
can
gather
we
must
detain
him
from
the
other
he
must
be
shown
that
he
ca
abandon
his
natural
duties
he
was
a
man
before
he
was
a
priest
as
you
say
he
can
no
more
give
up
his
duty
to
louisa
than
he
can
give
up
his
own
life
it
is
going
on
a
false
idea
altogether
but
falsehood
in
anything
except
in
argument
could
never
be
named
or
dreamed
of
in
connection
with
gerald
said
his
brother
with
some
emotion
we
all
know
that
there
was
another
pause
of
a
few
minutes
during
which
they
walked
on
side
by
side
without
even
the
heart
to
look
at
each
other
if
it
had
been
huxtable
or
plumstead
or
any
other
fool
burst
forth
the
squire
after
that
interval
but
gerald
huxtable
was
the
husband
of
the
eldest
miss
wentworth
and
plumstead
was
the
squire
son
so
the
comparison
was
all
in
the
family
i
suppose
your
aunt
leonora
would
say
such
a
thing
was
sent
to
bring
down
my
pride
and
keep
me
low
said
mr
wentworth
bitterly
jack
being
what
he
is
was
it
anything
but
natural
that
i
should
be
proud
of
gerald
there
never
was
any
evil
in
him
that
i
could
see
from
a
child
but
crotchety
always
crotchety
frank
i
can
see
it
now
it
must
have
been
their
mother
said
the
squire
meditatively
she
died
very
young
poor
girl
her
character
was
not
formed
as
for
dear
mother
my
boy
she
was
always
equal
to
an
emergency
she
would
have
given
us
the
best
of
advice
had
she
been
spared
to
us
this
day
mrs
wentworth
is
absorbed
in
her
nursery
as
is
natural
and
i
should
not
care
to
consult
her
much
on
such
a
subject
but
frank
whatever
you
can
do
or
say
trust
to
me
to
back
you
out
said
the
anxious
father
of
three
families
your
mother
was
the
most
sensible
woman
i
ever
knew
he
continued
with
a
patriarchal
composure
nobody
could
ever
manage
jack
and
gerald
as
she
did
she
have
seen
at
a
glance
what
to
do
now
as
for
jack
he
is
not
assistance
to
anybody
but
i
consider
you
very
like
your
mother
frank
if
anybody
can
help
gerald
it
will
be
you
he
has
got
into
some
ridiculous
complications
you
know
that
must
be
the
explanation
of
it
you
have
only
to
talk
to
him
and
clear
up
the
whole
affair
said
the
squire
recovering
himself
a
little
he
believed
in
talking
to
like
louisa
and
like
most
people
who
are
utterly
incapable
of
talking
to
any
purpose
he
took
some
courage
from
the
thought
and
recovered
his
colour
a
little
there
is
the
bell
for
luncheon
and
i
am
very
glad
of
it
he
said
a
glass
of
sherry
will
set
me
all
right
do
say
anything
to
alarm
mrs
wentworth
when
gerald
comes
we
retire
to
the
library
and
go
into
the
matter
calmly
and
between
us
we
will
surely
be
able
to
convince
him
humour
him
for
my
part
as
far
as
my
conscience
will
allow
me
we
must
not
give
in
to
him
frank
he
will
give
it
up
if
we
show
a
very
firm
front
and
yield
nothing
said
the
squire
looking
with
an
unusually
anxious
eye
in
his
son
face
for
my
part
i
will
not
enter
into
the
controversy
between
the
churches
said
the
curate
it
is
mere
waste
of
time
i
must
confine
myself
to
the
one
point
if
he
must
forsake
us
he
must
and
i
stop
him
but
he
must
not
forsake
his
wife
tut
it
impossible
said
the
squire
it
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
you
must
have
given
undue
importance
to
something
that
was
said
things
will
turn
out
better
than
you
think
they
were
very
nearly
at
the
great
entrance
when
these
words
were
said
and
mr
wentworth
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
held
it
to
his
forehead
to
veil
the
mark
until
he
could
explain
it
from
the
anxious
eye
of
his
wife
if
the
worst
should
come
to
the
worst
as
you
seem
to
think
he
said
with
a
kind
of
sigh
i
should
at
least
be
able
to
provide
for
you
frank
of
course
the
rectory
would
go
to
you
and
you
seem
to
have
much
chance
of
skelmersdale
so
far
as
i
can
learn
leonora
a
very
difficult
person
to
deal
with
god
bless
my
soul
exclaimed
the
squire
depend
upon
it
she
has
had
something
to
do
with
this
business
of
gerald
she
goaded
him
into
it
with
her
ways
she
put
poor
louisa
up
to
worrying
him
where
it
is
i
did
not
see
how
your
brother
could
possibly
have
fallen
into
such
a
blunder
of
his
own
accord
but
come
to
luncheon
you
must
be
hungry
you
will
think
the
boys
grown
frank
and
i
must
ask
you
what
you
think
when
you
have
a
little
leisure
of
cuthbert
and
guy
so
saying
the
squire
led
the
way
into
the
house
he
had
been
much
appalled
by
the
first
hint
of
this
threatened
calamity
and
was
seriously
distressed
and
anxious
still
but
he
was
the
father
of
many
sons
and
the
misfortunes
or
blunders
of
one
could
not
occupy
all
his
heart
and
even
the
curate
as
he
followed
his
father
into
the
house
felt
that
louisa
words
so
calmly
repeated
of
course
the
rectory
will
go
to
you
went
tingling
to
his
heart
like
an
arrow
painfully
recalling
him
in
the
midst
of
his
anxiety
to
a
sense
of
his
own
interests
and
cares
gerald
was
coming
up
the
avenue
at
the
moment
slowly
with
all
the
feelings
of
a
man
going
to
the
stake
he
was
looking
at
everything
round
as
a
dying
man
might
not
knowing
what
terrible
revolution
of
life
might
have
happened
before
he
saw
them
again
he
looked
on
hill
and
sea
and
shore
as
he
might
never
see
them
more
life
was
darkened
over
to
his
preoccupied
eyes
and
the
composure
of
nature
jarred
upon
him
as
though
it
were
carelessness
and
indifference
to
the
fate
which
he
felt
to
be
coming
in
the
air
he
thought
nothing
less
than
that
his
father
and
brother
were
discussing
him
with
hearts
as
heavy
and
clouded
as
his
own
for
even
he
in
all
his
tolerance
and
impartiality
did
not
make
due
account
of
the
fact
that
every
man
has
his
own
concerns
next
to
him
close
enough
to
ameliorate
and
lighten
the
weight
of
his
anxieties
for
others
the
prospect
was
all
gloom
to
gerald
who
was
the
sufferer
but
the
others
found
gleams
of
comfort
in
their
own
horizon
which
threw
reflected
lights
upon
his
for
perfect
sympathy
is
not
except
in
dreams
there
was
quite
a
joyful
little
commotion
at
the
luncheon
table
when
frank
arrival
was
discovered
and
his
sisters
were
kissing
him
and
his
young
brothers
shaking
his
hand
off
while
gerald
came
slowly
up
with
preoccupied
lingering
steps
underneath
the
murmurous
limes
all
kinds
of
strange
miseries
were
appearing
to
him
as
he
pursued
his
way
glimpses
of
scenes
to
come
a
dark
phantasmagoria
of
anticipated
pain
he
saw
his
wife
and
his
children
going
away
out
of
their
happy
house
he
saw
himself
severed
from
all
human
ties
among
alien
faces
and
customs
working
out
a
hard
novitiate
what
could
he
do
his
heart
so
long
on
the
rack
was
aching
with
dull
throbs
of
anguish
but
he
did
not
see
any
way
of
escape
he
was
a
priest
by
all
the
training
all
the
habits
of
his
life
how
could
he
give
up
that
service
to
which
he
was
called
before
everything
the
most
momentous
work
on
earth
for
ease
for
happiness
for
even
sacred
love
could
he
defraud
god
of
the
service
he
had
vowed
and
go
back
to
secular
work
just
at
the
moment
when
the
true
meaning
of
ecclesiastical
work
seemed
dawning
upon
him
he
had
decided
that
question
before
but
it
came
back
and
back
his
eyes
were
heavy
with
thought
and
conflict
as
he
went
up
to
his
father
house
all
this
was
wearing
out
his
strength
and
sapping
his
very
life
the
sooner
it
was
over
the
better
would
it
be
for
all
chapter
xviii
very
little
came
as
was
natural
of
the
talk
in
the
library
to
which
the
entire
afternoon
was
devoted
the
squire
in
his
way
was
as
great
an
interruption
to
the
arguments
of
the
curate
as
was
poor
louisa
in
hers
and
gerald
sat
patiently
to
listen
to
his
father
indignant
monologue
broken
as
it
was
by
frank
more
serious
attacks
he
was
prepared
for
all
they
could
say
to
him
and
listened
to
it
sometimes
with
a
kind
of
wondering
smile
knowing
well
how
much
more
strongly
backed
by
all
his
prejudices
and
interests
he
had
put
the
same
arguments
to
himself
all
this
time
nobody
discussed
the
practicability
of
the
matter
much
nor
what
steps
he
meant
to
take
what
immediately
occupied
both
his
father
and
brother
was
his
determination
itself
and
the
reasons
which
had
led
him
to
it
which
the
squire
like
louisa
could
not
understand
if
i
had
made
myself
disagreeable
said
mr
wentworth
if
i
had
remonstrated
with
him
as
leonora
urged
me
to
do
if
i
had
put
a
stop
to
the
surplice
and
so
forth
and
interfered
with
his
decorations
or
his
saints
days
or
anything
it
might
have
been
comprehensible
but
i
never
said
a
syllable
on
the
subject
i
give
you
my
word
i
never
did
why
could
he
have
sent
down
for
louisa
now
and
dined
at
the
hall
as
usual
when
any
of
my
sons
come
home
i
suppose
a
man
may
change
his
religion
sir
without
getting
rid
of
his
natural
affections
said
the
squire
gazing
out
with
puzzled
looks
to
watch
gerald
going
slowly
down
the
avenue
a
man
who
talks
of
leaving
his
wife
and
declines
to
dine
at
his
father
house
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
is
a
mystery
i
ca
understand
i
do
suppose
he
cares
for
a
lively
party
like
ours
at
this
moment
said
the
curate
i
do
take
it
as
any
sign
of
a
want
of
affection
for
me
the
squire
puffed
forth
a
large
sigh
of
trouble
and
vexation
as
he
came
from
the
window
if
were
to
give
in
to
trouble
when
it
appears
what
would
become
of
our
lively
party
i
wonder
he
said
i
getting
an
old
man
frank
but
there
not
a
young
man
in
christendom
has
more
need
to
take
care
of
himself
and
preserve
his
health
than
i
have
i
am
very
well
thank
god
though
i
have
had
a
touch
of
our
wentworth
complaint
just
one
touch
my
father
had
it
ten
years
earlier
in
life
and
lived
to
eighty
all
the
same
but
that
is
an
age
i
shall
never
see
such
worries
as
i
have
would
kill
any
man
i
not
spoken
to
anybody
about
it
said
the
squire
hastily
but
jack
is
going
a
terrible
pace
just
now
i
had
a
good
deal
of
bother
about
bills
and
things
he
gets
worse
every
year
and
what
would
become
of
the
girls
and
the
little
children
if
the
estate
were
to
come
into
jack
hands
is
a
thought
i
do
like
to
dwell
upon
frank
i
suppose
he
never
writes
to
you
not
for
years
past
said
the
curate
not
since
i
was
at
oxford
where
is
he
now
somewhere
about
town
i
suppose
said
the
aggrieved
father
or
wherever
the
greatest
scamps
collect
when
they
go
out
of
town
where
he
is
i
could
show
you
a
little
document
or
two
frank
but
now
said
the
squire
shutting
up
a
drawer
which
he
had
unlocked
and
partly
opened
i
wo
you
enough
on
your
mind
with
gerald
and
i
told
you
i
should
be
glad
of
your
advice
about
cuthbert
and
guy
upon
which
the
father
and
son
plunged
into
family
affairs
cuthbert
and
guy
were
the
youngest
of
the
squire
middle
family
a
lot
which
included
frank
and
charley
and
the
three
sisters
one
of
whom
was
married
the
domestic
relations
of
the
wentworths
were
complicated
in
this
generation
jack
and
gerald
were
of
the
first
marriage
a
period
in
his
history
which
mr
wentworth
himself
had
partly
forgotten
and
the
troop
of
children
at
present
in
the
hall
nursery
were
quite
beyond
the
powers
of
any
brother
to
recognise
or
identify
it
was
vaguely
understood
that
the
girls
knew
all
the
small
fry
by
head
and
name
but
even
the
squire
himself
was
apt
to
get
puzzled
with
such
a
household
and
with
an
heir
impending
over
his
head
like
jack
it
may
be
supposed
that
mr
wentworth
anxiety
to
get
his
younger
boys
disposed
of
was
great
cuthbert
and
guy
were
arrows
in
the
hand
of
the
giant
but
he
had
his
quiver
so
full
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
draw
his
bow
and
shoot
them
away
into
as
distant
and
as
fresh
a
sphere
as
possible
they
were
sworn
companions
and
allies
but
they
were
not
clever
mr
wentworth
believed
and
he
was
very
glad
to
consult
over
new
zealand
and
australia
and
which
was
best
with
their
brother
frank
they
are
good
boys
said
their
father
but
they
have
not
any
brains
to
speak
of
not
like
gerald
and
you
though
after
all
i
begin
to
be
doubtful
what
the
good
of
brains
added
the
squire
disconsolately
if
this
is
all
that
comes
of
them
after
building
so
much
on
gerald
for
years
and
feeling
that
one
might
live
to
see
him
a
bishop
but
however
there
still
left
you
all
right
frank
oh
yes
i
am
all
right
said
the
curate
with
a
sigh
but
neither
gerald
nor
i
are
the
stuff
that
bishops
are
made
of
he
added
laughing
i
hope
you
do
dream
of
any
such
honour
for
me
but
the
squire
was
too
troubled
in
his
mind
for
laughter
jack
was
always
clever
too
he
said
dolefully
and
little
good
has
come
of
that
i
hope
he
wo
disgrace
the
family
any
more
than
he
has
done
in
my
time
frank
you
young
fellows
have
all
your
life
before
you
but
when
a
man
comes
to
my
age
and
expects
a
little
comfort
it
hard
to
be
dragged
into
the
mire
after
his
children
i
did
my
duty
by
jack
too
i
can
say
that
for
myself
he
had
the
same
training
as
gerald
had
the
same
tutor
at
the
university
everything
just
the
same
how
do
you
account
for
that
sir
you
that
are
a
philosopher
said
mr
wentworth
again
with
a
touch
of
irritation
own
brothers
both
by
father
and
mother
brought
up
in
the
same
house
same
school
and
college
and
everything
and
all
the
time
as
different
from
each
other
as
light
and
darkness
how
do
you
account
for
that
though
to
be
sure
gerald
taken
to
bad
ways
too
it
must
have
been
some
weakness
by
their
mother
side
poor
girl
she
died
too
young
to
show
it
herself
but
it
come
out
in
her
children
said
the
vexed
squire
though
it
a
poor
sort
of
thing
to
blame
them
that
are
gone
he
added
with
penitence
and
he
got
up
and
paced
uneasily
about
the
room
who
was
there
else
to
blame
not
himself
for
he
had
done
his
duty
by
his
boys
mr
wentworth
never
was
disturbed
in
mind
without
as
his
family
were
well
aware
becoming
excited
in
temper
too
and
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
new
trouble
had
somehow
added
a
keener
touch
of
exasperation
to
his
perennial
dissatisfaction
with
his
heir
if
jack
had
been
the
man
he
ought
to
have
been
his
advice
might
have
done
some
good
for
a
clergyman
naturally
sees
things
in
a
different
light
from
a
man
of
the
world
said
the
troubled
father
and
frank
perceived
that
he
too
shared
in
his
father
displeasure
because
he
was
not
jack
nor
a
man
of
the
world
notwithstanding
that
being
frank
and
a
clergyman
he
was
acknowledged
by
public
opinion
to
be
the
squire
favourite
in
the
family
things
continued
in
this
uncomfortable
state
up
to
the
so
that
the
curate
even
had
his
own
feelings
permitted
it
had
but
little
comfort
in
his
home
visit
at
dinner
mr
wentworth
did
not
eat
and
awoke
the
anxiety
of
his
wife
who
drove
the
old
gentleman
into
a
state
of
desperation
by
inquiries
after
his
health
indeed
i
wish
you
would
remonstrate
with
your
papa
frank
said
his
stepmother
who
was
not
a
great
deal
older
than
the
curate
after
his
attack
he
ought
to
be
more
careful
but
he
never
takes
the
least
trouble
about
himself
no
more
than
if
he
were
after
getting
such
a
knock
on
the
forehead
too
and
you
see
he
eats
nothing
i
shall
be
miserable
if
the
doctor
is
not
sent
for
stuff
cried
the
squire
testily
perhaps
you
will
speak
to
the
cook
about
these
messes
she
insists
on
sending
up
to
disgust
one
and
leave
me
to
take
care
of
my
own
health
do
touch
that
dish
frank
poison
i
am
glad
gerald
is
not
here
he
think
we
never
had
a
dinner
without
that
confounded
mixture
and
then
the
wonder
is
that
one
eat
said
mr
wentworth
in
a
tone
which
spread
consternation
round
the
table
mrs
wentworth
secretly
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
behind
the
great
cover
which
had
not
yet
been
removed
and
one
of
the
girls
dashed
in
violently
to
the
rescue
of
course
making
everything
worse
why
did
not
gerald
and
louisa
come
to
dinner
cried
the
ignorant
sister
surely
when
they
knew
frank
had
come
they
would
have
liked
to
be
here
how
very
odd
it
was
of
you
not
to
ask
them
papa
they
always
do
come
when
anybody
has
arrived
why
are
they
here
because
they
do
choose
to
come
said
the
squire
abruptly
if
gerald
has
reasons
for
staying
away
from
his
father
house
what
is
that
to
you
butterflies
said
mr
wentworth
looking
at
them
in
their
pretty
dresses
as
they
sat
regarding
him
with
dismay
that
understand
any
reason
for
doing
anything
except
liking
it
or
not
liking
it
i
daresay
by
this
time
your
sister
knows
better
my
sister
is
married
papa
said
letty
with
her
saucy
look
i
advise
you
to
get
married
too
and
learn
what
life
is
like
said
the
savage
squire
and
conversation
visibly
flagged
after
this
effort
when
the
ladies
got
safely
into
the
they
gathered
into
a
corner
to
consult
over
it
they
were
all
naturally
anxious
about
him
after
his
attack
do
you
remember
he
was
just
like
this
before
it
came
on
said
mrs
wentworth
nervously
so
cross
and
finding
fault
with
the
made
dishes
do
you
think
i
might
send
over
a
message
to
dr
small
not
to
come
on
purpose
you
know
but
just
as
if
it
were
a
call
in
passing
but
the
girls
both
agreed
this
would
make
matters
worse
it
must
be
something
about
jack
they
both
said
in
a
breath
in
a
kind
of
awe
of
their
elder
brother
of
whom
they
had
a
very
imperfect
knowledge
and
it
seems
we
never
are
to
have
a
chance
of
a
word
with
frank
cried
letty
who
was
indignant
and
exasperated
but
at
least
it
was
a
consolation
that
the
boys
were
no
better
off
all
next
day
cuthbert
and
guy
hung
about
in
the
vain
hope
of
securing
the
company
and
attention
of
the
visitor
he
was
at
the
rectory
the
whole
morning
sometimes
with
gerald
sometimes
with
louisa
as
the
scouts
of
the
family
consisting
of
a
variety
of
brothers
little
and
big
informed
the
anxious
girls
and
louisa
was
seen
to
cry
on
one
of
these
occasions
and
gerald
looked
cross
said
one
little
spy
whereupon
he
had
his
ears
boxed
and
was
dismissed
from
the
service
as
if
gerald
ever
looked
anything
but
a
saint
said
the
younger
sister
who
was
an
advanced
anglican
letty
however
holding
other
views
confuted
this
opinion
strongly
when
one
thinks
of
a
saint
it
is
aunt
leonora
one
thinks
of
said
this
profane
young
woman
i
tell
you
what
gerald
looks
like
something
just
between
a
conqueror
and
a
martyr
i
think
of
all
the
men
i
ever
saw
he
is
my
hero
said
letty
meditatively
the
youngest
miss
wentworth
was
not
exactly
of
this
latter
opinion
but
she
did
not
contradict
her
sister
they
were
kept
in
a
state
of
watchfulness
all
day
but
frank
mission
remained
a
mystery
which
they
could
not
penetrate
and
in
the
evening
gerald
alone
made
his
appearance
at
the
hall
to
dinner
explaining
that
louisa
had
a
headache
now
louisa
headaches
were
not
unfrequent
but
they
were
known
to
improve
in
the
prospect
of
going
out
to
dinner
on
the
whole
the
matter
was
wrapt
in
obscurity
and
the
wentworth
household
could
not
explain
it
the
sisters
sat
up
brushing
their
hair
and
looking
very
pretty
in
their
with
their
bright
locks
for
the
wentworth
hair
was
of
a
titian
hue
over
their
shoulders
discussing
the
matter
till
it
was
long
past
midnight
but
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
and
the
only
conclusion
they
came
to
was
that
their
two
clergymen
brothers
were
occupied
in
negotiating
with
the
squire
about
some
secret
not
known
to
the
rest
of
the
family
but
most
probably
concerning
jack
jack
was
almost
unknown
to
his
sisters
and
awoke
no
very
warm
anxiety
in
their
minds
so
they
went
to
sleep
at
last
in
tolerable
quiet
concluding
that
whatever
mystery
there
was
concerned
only
the
and
least
loved
of
the
house
while
the
girls
pursued
these
innocent
deliberations
and
reasoned
themselves
into
conviction
the
squire
too
sat
late
much
later
than
usual
he
had
gone
with
frank
to
the
library
and
sat
there
in
quietness
which
the
curate
could
not
see
without
alarm
and
from
which
he
roused
himself
up
now
and
then
to
wander
off
into
talk
which
always
began
with
gerald
and
always
came
back
to
his
own
anxieties
and
his
disappointed
hopes
in
his
eldest
son
if
jack
had
been
the
man
he
ought
to
have
been
i
have
telegraphed
for
him
and
he
have
managed
it
all
said
the
squire
and
then
relapsed
once
more
into
silence
for
neither
you
nor
i
are
men
of
the
world
frank
he
would
resume
again
after
a
pause
of
half
an
hour
revealing
pitifully
how
his
mind
laboured
under
the
weight
of
this
absorbing
thought
the
curate
sat
up
with
him
in
the
library
feeling
the
silence
and
the
darkness
to
his
heart
he
could
not
assist
his
father
in
those
dim
ranges
of
painful
meditation
grieved
as
he
was
he
could
not
venture
to
compare
his
own
distress
with
the
bitterness
of
the
squire
disappointed
in
all
his
hopes
and
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
and
then
the
young
man
saw
compensations
and
heroisms
in
gerald
case
which
were
invisible
to
the
unheroic
eyes
of
mr
wentworth
who
looked
at
it
entirely
from
a
practical
point
of
view
and
regarded
with
keen
mortification
an
event
which
would
lay
all
the
affairs
of
the
wentworths
open
to
general
discussion
and
invite
the
eye
of
the
world
to
a
renewed
examination
of
his
domestic
skeletons
everything
had
been
hushed
and
shut
up
in
the
hall
for
at
least
an
hour
when
the
squire
got
up
at
last
and
lighted
his
candle
and
held
out
his
hand
to
his
son
this
is
a
very
cheerful
visit
for
you
frank
he
said
but
we
try
again
and
have
one
other
talk
with
gerald
could
you
read
up
some
books
on
the
subject
or
think
of
something
new
to
say
to
him
god
bless
my
soul
if
i
were
as
young
and
as
much
accustomed
to
talking
as
you
are
surely
find
out
some
argument
said
the
squire
with
a
momentary
spark
of
temper
which
made
his
son
feel
more
comfortable
about
him
it
your
business
to
convince
a
man
when
he
wrong
we
try
gerald
once
more
and
perhaps
something
may
come
of
it
and
as
for
jack
here
the
squire
paused
and
shook
his
head
and
let
go
his
son
hand
i
suppose
it
sitting
up
so
late
that
makes
one
feel
so
cold
and
wretched
and
as
if
one
saw
ghosts
said
mr
wentworth
do
stay
here
any
longer
and
take
care
of
the
candles
i
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
two
hours
ago
and
as
he
walked
away
the
curate
could
not
but
observe
what
an
aged
figure
it
looked
moving
with
a
certain
caution
to
the
door
the
great
library
was
so
dim
that
the
light
of
the
candle
which
the
squire
carried
in
his
hand
was
necessary
to
reveal
his
figure
clearly
and
there
was
no
mistaking
his
air
of
age
and
feebleness
the
thoughts
were
not
very
agreeable
when
he
was
left
by
himself
in
the
room
his
imagination
jumped
to
a
picture
very
possible
but
grievous
to
think
of
jack
seated
in
his
father
place
and
the
girls
and
the
little
children
turned
out
upon
the
world
in
such
a
case
who
would
be
their
protector
and
natural
guardian
not
gerald
who
was
about
to
divest
himself
of
ties
still
closer
and
more
sacred
the
curate
lit
his
candle
too
and
went
hastily
to
his
room
when
that
thought
came
upon
him
there
might
be
circumstances
still
more
hopeless
and
appalling
than
the
opposition
of
a
rector
or
the
want
of
a
benefice
he
preferred
to
return
to
his
anxiety
about
gerald
and
to
put
away
that
thought
as
he
went
hurriedly
chapter
xix
the
sum
of
it
all
is
that
you
wo
hear
any
reason
gerald
said
the
squire
what
your
brother
says
and
what
i
say
are
nothing
your
poor
wife
is
nothing
and
all
a
man
duties
sir
in
life
all
your
responsibilities
everything
that
is
considered
most
sacred
you
may
say
what
you
will
to
me
father
said
gerald
i
expect
you
should
speak
differently
but
you
may
imagine
i
have
looked
at
it
in
every
possible
light
before
i
came
to
this
resolution
a
man
does
not
decide
easily
when
everything
he
prizes
on
earth
is
at
stake
i
can
not
see
with
frank
eyes
or
with
yours
according
to
the
light
god
has
given
me
i
must
see
with
my
own
but
god
bless
my
soul
what
do
you
mean
by
seeing
with
your
own
eyes
said
the
squire
do
you
know
that
is
a
protestant
doctrine
sir
do
you
think
they
let
you
see
with
any
eyes
but
theirs
when
you
get
among
a
set
of
papists
instead
of
an
bishop
and
friendly
fellows
for
brother
clergymen
and
parishioners
that
think
everything
that
good
of
you
how
do
you
suppose
you
feel
as
an
englishman
when
you
get
into
a
dead
frenchified
system
with
everything
going
by
rule
and
measure
and
bound
to
believe
just
as
you
told
it
kill
you
sir
that
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
if
you
are
in
your
grave
within
the
year
it
will
be
no
wonder
to
me
amen
said
gerald
softly
if
that
is
to
be
all
we
will
not
quarrel
with
the
result
and
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
as
if
to
look
for
his
cedar
which
was
not
there
perhaps
the
absence
of
his
silent
referee
gave
him
a
kind
of
comfort
though
at
the
same
time
it
disappointed
him
in
some
fantastical
way
for
he
turned
with
a
curious
look
of
relief
and
vexation
to
his
brother
we
need
not
be
always
thinking
of
it
even
if
this
were
to
be
the
end
he
said
come
down
the
avenue
with
me
frank
and
let
us
talk
of
something
else
the
girls
will
grumble
but
they
can
have
you
later
come
i
want
to
hear
about
yourself
unfortunately
the
squire
got
up
when
his
sons
did
which
was
by
no
means
their
intention
but
mr
wentworth
was
vexed
and
restless
and
was
not
willing
to
let
gerald
off
so
easily
if
he
were
mad
at
least
he
ought
to
be
made
duly
wretched
in
his
madness
mr
wentworth
thought
and
he
went
out
with
them
and
arrested
the
words
on
their
lips
somehow
everything
seemed
to
concur
in
hindering
any
appeal
on
the
part
of
the
curate
and
gerald
like
most
imaginative
men
had
a
power
of
dismissing
his
troubles
after
they
had
taken
their
will
of
him
it
was
he
who
took
the
conversation
on
himself
when
they
went
out
of
doors
finding
frank
slow
in
his
report
gerald
went
into
all
the
country
news
for
the
instruction
of
his
brother
he
had
been
down
to
the
very
depths
during
the
two
previous
days
and
now
he
had
come
aloft
again
for
a
man
can
not
be
miserable
every
moment
of
his
life
however
heavy
his
burden
may
be
the
girls
whose
anxieties
had
been
much
stimulated
by
the
renewed
conference
held
with
closed
doors
in
the
library
stood
watching
them
from
one
of
the
windows
the
boldest
of
the
two
had
indeed
got
her
hat
to
follow
them
not
comprehending
why
frank
should
be
monopolised
for
days
together
by
anybody
but
herself
his
favourite
sister
but
something
in
the
aspect
of
the
three
men
when
they
first
appeared
under
the
had
awed
even
the
lively
letty
out
of
her
usual
courage
but
gerald
is
talking
and
laughing
just
as
usual
she
said
as
she
stood
at
the
window
dangling
her
hat
in
her
hand
more
than
usual
for
he
has
been
very
glum
all
this
spring
poor
fellow
i
daresay
louisa
worries
him
out
of
his
life
and
with
this
easy
conclusion
the
elder
brother
was
dismissed
by
the
girls
perhaps
frank
is
going
to
be
married
said
the
other
sister
who
under
the
lively
spur
of
this
idea
came
back
to
the
window
to
gaze
at
him
again
and
find
out
whether
any
intimation
of
this
alarming
possibility
could
be
gathered
from
the
fit
of
his
long
clerical
coat
or
his
manner
of
walk
as
he
sauntered
along
under
the
limes
as
if
a
perpetual
curate
could
marry
said
letty
with
scorn
who
knew
the
world
as
for
little
janet
who
was
a
little
soul
she
folded
her
two
hands
together
and
looked
at
her
brother
back
with
a
great
increase
of
interest
if
one
loved
him
one
would
not
mind
what
he
was
said
the
little
maiden
who
had
been
in
some
trouble
herself
and
understood
about
such
matters
so
the
girls
talked
at
their
window
mrs
wentworth
being
as
usual
occupied
with
her
nursery
and
nobody
else
at
hand
to
teach
them
wisdom
and
soon
branched
off
into
speculations
about
the
which
was
due
and
which
perhaps
was
almost
more
interesting
to
one
of
them
at
least
than
even
a
brother
who
was
going
to
be
married
in
the
mean
time
gerald
was
talking
of
huxtable
and
plumstead
the
and
cousin
who
were
both
clergymen
in
the
same
district
and
about
the
people
in
the
village
whom
they
had
known
when
they
were
boys
and
who
never
grew
any
older
there
is
old
kilweed
for
example
who
was
methuselah
in
those
days
he
not
eighty
yet
he
said
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
it
is
we
who
grow
older
and
come
nearer
to
the
winter
and
the
sunset
my
father
even
has
come
down
a
long
way
off
the
awful
eminence
on
which
i
used
to
behold
him
every
year
that
falls
on
my
head
seems
to
take
one
off
his
if
we
both
live
long
enough
we
shall
feel
like
contemporaries
said
gerald
just
now
the
advantage
of
years
is
all
on
my
side
and
you
are
my
junior
sir
he
was
switching
down
the
weeds
among
the
grass
with
his
cane
as
he
spoke
like
any
schoolboy
the
air
and
perhaps
a
little
excitement
had
roused
the
blood
to
his
cheek
he
did
not
look
the
same
man
as
the
pale
martyr
in
the
library
not
that
he
had
any
reason
for
appearing
different
but
only
that
inalienable
poetic
waywardness
which
kept
him
up
through
his
trouble
as
for
mr
wentworth
he
resented
the
momentary
brightening
which
he
took
for
levity
i
thought
we
came
out
here
to
prolong
our
discussion
said
the
squire
i
do
understand
this
light
way
of
talking
if
you
mean
what
you
have
said
sir
i
should
never
expect
to
see
you
smile
more
the
smiling
makes
little
difference
said
gerald
but
he
stopped
short
in
his
talk
and
there
was
a
pause
among
them
till
the
postboy
came
up
to
them
with
his
bag
which
mr
wentworth
with
much
importance
paused
to
open
the
young
men
who
had
no
special
interest
in
its
contents
went
on
perhaps
the
absence
of
their
father
was
a
relief
to
them
they
were
nearer
to
each
other
understood
each
other
better
than
he
could
do
and
they
quickened
their
pace
insensibly
as
they
began
to
talk
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
kind
of
talk
it
was
entire
sympathy
yet
disagreement
wide
as
the
poles
here
for
a
few
steps
side
by
side
there
darting
off
at
the
most
opposite
tangent
but
they
had
begun
to
warm
to
it
and
to
forget
everything
else
when
a
succession
of
lusty
hollos
from
the
squire
brought
them
suddenly
to
themselves
and
to
a
dead
stop
when
they
looked
round
he
was
making
up
to
them
with
choleric
strides
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
sir
by
having
telegrams
sent
here
cried
mr
wentworth
pitching
at
his
son
frank
an
ominous
ugly
envelope
in
blue
and
red
such
as
the
unsophisticated
mind
naturally
trembles
at
beg
your
pardon
gerald
but
i
never
can
keep
my
temper
when
i
see
a
telegraph
i
daresay
it
something
about
charley
said
the
old
man
in
a
slightly
husky
voice
to
make
up
to
us
for
inventing
troubles
the
squire
was
a
good
deal
disturbed
by
the
sight
of
that
message
and
it
was
the
better
way
as
he
knew
by
experience
to
throw
his
excitement
into
the
shape
of
anger
rather
than
that
of
grief
it
nothing
about
charley
said
frank
and
mr
wentworth
blew
his
nose
violently
and
drew
a
long
breath
i
do
understand
it
said
the
curate
who
looked
scared
and
pale
it
seems
to
be
from
jack
though
why
is
in
carlingford
or
what
he
has
to
do
he
ill
sir
i
suppose
dying
nothing
else
was
to
be
looked
for
said
the
squire
and
held
out
his
hand
which
trembled
for
the
telegram
stuff
why
should
i
be
able
to
bear
it
has
he
been
any
comfort
to
me
ca
you
read
it
one
of
you
cried
the
old
man
wentworth
to
the
reverend
god
bless
my
soul
ca
you
come
to
what
he
says
back
directly
you
are
wanted
here
i
am
in
trouble
as
usual
and
here
the
squire
took
a
step
backwards
and
set
himself
against
a
tree
the
sun
comes
in
one
eyes
he
said
rather
feebly
something
poisonous
in
the
air
today
here
gerald
going
out
of
the
church
and
here
frank
in
jack
secrets
god
forgive
him
lads
it
seems
you
think
i
had
enough
of
this
world
good
my
heir
a
swindling
villain
and
you
know
it
and
here
frank
going
the
same
road
too
the
squire
did
not
hear
the
words
that
both
the
brothers
addressed
to
him
he
was
unconscious
of
the
curate
disclaimer
and
eager
explanation
that
he
knew
nothing
about
jack
and
could
not
understand
his
presence
in
carlingford
the
blow
he
had
got
the
previous
day
had
confused
his
brain
outside
and
these
accumulated
vexations
had
bewildered
it
within
and
i
could
have
sworn
by
frank
said
the
old
man
piteously
to
himself
as
he
put
up
his
hand
unawares
and
tugged
at
the
dainty
starched
cravat
which
was
his
pride
if
they
had
not
held
him
in
their
arms
he
would
have
slid
down
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
against
which
he
had
instinctively
propped
himself
the
attack
was
less
alarming
to
gerald
who
had
seen
it
before
than
to
frank
who
had
only
heard
of
it
but
the
postboy
was
still
within
call
by
good
fortune
and
was
sent
off
for
assistance
they
carried
him
to
the
hall
gasping
for
breath
and
in
a
state
of
partial
unconsciousness
but
still
feebly
repeating
those
words
which
went
to
the
curate
heart
i
could
have
sworn
by
frank
the
house
was
in
a
great
fright
and
tumult
naturally
before
they
reached
it
mrs
wentworth
fainting
the
girls
looking
on
in
dismay
and
the
whole
household
moved
to
awe
and
alarm
knowing
that
one
time
or
other
death
would
come
so
as
for
the
curate
of
st
roque
he
had
already
made
up
his
mind
with
unexpected
anguish
not
only
that
his
father
was
dying
but
that
his
father
would
die
under
a
fatal
misconception
about
himself
and
between
this
overwhelming
thought
and
the
anxiety
which
nobody
understood
or
could
sympathise
with
respecting
jack
message
the
young
man
was
almost
beside
himself
he
went
away
in
utter
despair
from
the
anxious
consultations
of
the
family
after
the
doctor
had
come
and
kept
walking
up
and
down
before
the
house
waiting
to
hear
the
worst
as
he
thought
but
yet
unable
even
while
his
father
lay
dying
to
keep
from
thinking
what
miserable
chance
what
folly
or
crime
had
taken
jack
to
carlingford
and
what
his
brother
could
have
to
do
with
the
owner
of
the
initials
named
in
his
telegram
he
was
lost
in
this
twofold
trouble
when
gerald
came
out
to
him
with
brightened
looks
he
is
coming
round
and
the
doctor
says
there
is
no
immediate
danger
said
gerald
and
it
is
only
immediate
danger
one
is
afraid
of
he
was
as
well
as
ever
last
time
in
a
day
or
two
it
is
the
complaint
of
the
wentworths
you
know
we
all
die
of
it
but
frank
tell
me
what
is
this
about
jack
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
said
the
curate
when
he
had
recovered
himself
a
little
i
must
go
back
not
having
done
much
good
here
to
see
and
said
gerald
the
elder
brother
looked
at
the
younger
suspiciously
as
if
he
were
afraid
for
him
and
it
was
scarcely
in
human
nature
not
to
feel
a
momentary
flash
of
resentment
i
tell
you
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
frank
except
what
is
evident
to
any
one
that
jack
has
gone
to
carlingford
in
my
absence
being
in
trouble
somehow
i
suppose
he
always
is
in
trouble
i
have
not
heard
from
him
since
i
went
there
but
as
it
do
seem
i
can
be
of
any
use
here
as
soon
as
my
father
is
safe
i
will
go
back
louisa
imagined
you
know
but
she
was
wrong
yes
said
gerald
quietly
that
subject
was
concluded
and
there
was
no
more
to
say
the
same
evening
as
the
squire
continued
to
improve
and
had
been
able
to
understand
his
energetic
explanation
that
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
jack
secrets
frank
wentworth
went
back
again
with
a
very
disturbed
mind
he
went
into
the
rectory
as
he
passed
down
to
the
station
to
say
to
louisa
who
was
sitting
in
the
with
her
children
round
her
and
her
trouble
considerably
lightened
though
there
was
no
particular
cause
for
it
dressing
for
dinner
had
of
itself
a
beneficial
effect
upon
louisa
she
could
not
understand
how
a
life
could
ever
be
changed
which
was
so
clearly
ordained
of
heaven
for
if
gerald
was
not
with
her
what
inducement
could
she
possibly
have
to
dress
for
dinner
and
then
what
would
be
the
good
of
all
the
pretty
wardrobe
with
which
providence
had
endowed
her
must
not
providence
take
care
that
its
gifts
were
not
thus
wasted
so
the
world
was
once
more
set
fast
on
its
foundations
and
the
pillars
of
earth
remained
unshaken
when
frank
glanced
in
on
his
way
to
the
station
to
say
do
be
afraid
louisa
i
do
believe
he
would
be
allowed
to
do
it
said
the
curate
in
her
ear
the
church
of
rome
does
not
go
in
the
face
of
nature
she
will
not
take
him
away
from
you
keep
your
heart
at
ease
as
much
as
you
can
you
mean
about
gerald
oh
you
do
think
he
could
ever
have
had
the
heart
said
mrs
wentworth
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
going
away
without
any
dinner
or
anything
comfortable
and
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
come
and
i
feel
so
much
better
i
shall
always
be
grateful
to
you
dear
frank
for
showing
gerald
his
mistake
and
tell
dear
aunt
dora
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
her
for
thinking
of
the
blanket
for
the
bassinet
i
am
sure
it
will
be
lovely
must
you
go
i
am
sure
you
have
always
been
like
my
own
brother
frank
dear
come
and
kiss
your
dear
uncle
children
and
say
this
was
how
louisa
dismissed
him
after
all
his
efforts
on
her
behalf
the
girls
were
waiting
for
him
on
the
road
still
full
of
anxiety
to
know
why
he
had
come
so
suddenly
and
was
going
away
so
soon
we
have
not
had
half
a
peep
of
you
said
letty
and
it
is
wicked
of
you
not
to
tell
us
as
if
anybody
could
sympathise
like
your
sisters
your
very
own
sisters
frank
said
the
young
lady
with
a
pressure
on
his
arm
in
such
a
mixed
family
the
words
meant
something
we
had
made
up
our
minds
you
had
come
to
tell
papa
said
janet
with
her
pretty
shy
look
that
was
my
guess
you
might
tell
us
her
name
frank
whose
name
said
the
unfortunate
curate
and
the
dazzling
vision
of
lucy
wodehouse
face
which
came
upon
him
at
the
moment
was
such
that
the
reluctant
blood
rose
high
in
his
cheeks
which
of
course
the
girls
were
quick
enough
to
perceive
it
about
some
girl
after
all
said
letty
oh
me
i
did
not
think
you
had
been
like
all
the
rest
i
thought
you
had
other
things
to
think
of
janet
may
say
what
she
likes
but
i
do
think
contemptible
always
to
find
out
when
a
man
who
can
do
lots
of
things
is
in
trouble
that
it
about
some
girl
or
other
like
self
i
did
not
expect
it
of
you
frank
but
all
the
same
tell
us
who
she
is
said
the
favourite
sister
clasping
his
arm
confidentially
and
dropping
her
voice
there
is
the
train
girls
and
be
sure
you
write
to
me
how
my
father
is
said
the
curate
he
had
taken
his
seat
before
they
could
ask
further
questions
and
in
a
minute
or
two
more
was
dashing
out
of
the
little
station
catching
their
smiles
and
adieus
as
he
went
and
turning
back
last
of
all
for
another
look
at
gerald
who
stood
leaning
on
his
stick
looking
after
the
train
with
the
mist
of
preoccupation
gathering
again
over
his
smiling
eyes
the
curate
went
back
to
his
corner
after
that
and
lost
himself
in
thoughts
and
anxieties
still
more
painful
what
had
jack
to
do
in
carlingford
what
connection
had
he
with
those
initials
or
how
did
he
know
their
owner
all
sorts
of
horrible
fears
came
over
the
curate
of
st
roque
he
had
not
seen
his
elder
brother
for
years
and
career
was
not
one
for
the
family
to
be
proud
of
had
he
done
something
too
terrible
to
be
hidden
too
clamorous
to
let
his
name
drop
out
of
remembrance
as
was
to
be
desired
for
the
credit
of
the
wentworths
this
speculation
whiled
the
night
away
but
drearily
as
the
perpetual
curate
went
back
to
the
unknown
tide
of
cares
which
had
surged
in
his
absence
into
his
momentarily
abandoned
place
chapter
xx
mr
wentworth
got
back
to
carlingford
by
a
happy
concurrence
of
trains
before
the
town
had
gone
to
sleep
it
was
summer
when
the
days
are
at
the
longest
and
the
twilight
was
just
falling
into
night
as
he
took
his
way
through
george
street
he
went
along
the
familiar
street
with
a
certain
terror
of
looking
into
people
faces
whom
he
met
and
of
asking
questions
such
as
was
natural
to
a
man
who
did
not
know
whether
something
of
public
note
might
not
have
happened
in
his
absence
to
call
attention
to
his
name
he
imagined
indeed
that
he
did
see
a
strange
expression
in
the
looks
of
the
townsfolk
he
encountered
on
his
way
he
thought
they
looked
at
him
askance
as
they
made
their
salutations
and
said
something
to
each
other
after
they
passed
which
indeed
in
several
cases
was
true
enough
though
the
cause
was
totally
different
from
anything
suspected
by
mr
wentworth
anxious
to
know
and
yet
unwilling
to
ask
it
was
with
a
certain
relief
that
the
curate
saw
the
light
gleaming
out
from
the
open
door
of
elsworthy
shop
as
he
approached
he
went
in
and
tossed
down
his
on
the
counter
and
threw
himself
on
the
solitary
chair
which
stood
outside
for
the
accommodation
of
customers
with
a
suppressed
excitement
which
made
his
question
sound
abrupt
and
significant
to
the
ears
of
elsworthy
has
anything
happened
since
i
went
away
said
mr
wentworth
throwing
a
glance
round
the
shop
which
alarmed
his
faithful
retainer
somehow
though
nothing
was
farther
from
his
mind
than
little
rosa
or
any
thought
of
her
the
curate
missed
the
pretty
little
figure
at
the
first
glance
well
no
sir
not
much
as
i
heard
of
said
elsworthy
with
a
little
confusion
he
was
tying
up
his
newspapers
as
usual
but
it
did
not
require
the
touch
of
suspicion
and
anxiety
which
gave
sharpness
to
the
curate
eyes
to
make
it
apparent
that
the
cord
was
trembling
in
mr
elsworthy
hand
i
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
journey
sir
and
a
comfortable
visit
it
been
but
short
but
we
always
miss
you
in
carlingford
mr
wentworth
if
it
was
only
for
a
day
i
take
my
paper
said
the
young
man
who
was
not
satisfied
so
there
no
news
is
there
all
well
and
everything
going
on
as
usual
and
the
look
which
the
suspicious
curate
bent
upon
mr
elsworthy
made
that
virtuous
individual
as
he
himself
described
it
shake
in
his
shoes
much
as
usual
sir
said
the
frightened
clerk
nothing
new
as
i
hear
of
but
gossip
and
that
aint
a
thing
to
interest
a
clergyman
there
always
one
report
or
another
flying
about
but
them
follies
aint
for
your
hearing
nothing
more
continued
mr
elsworthy
conscious
of
guilt
and
presenting
a
very
tremulous
countenance
to
the
inspection
of
his
suspicious
auditor
not
if
it
was
my
last
word
nothing
but
gossip
as
you
would
care
to
hear
i
might
possibly
care
to
hear
if
it
concerned
myself
said
the
curate
or
anybody
i
am
interested
in
he
added
after
a
little
pause
with
rather
a
forced
smile
which
convinced
mr
elsworthy
that
his
clergyman
had
heard
all
about
rosa
and
that
the
days
of
his
incumbency
as
clerk
of
st
roque
were
numbered
well
sir
if
you
did
hear
it
aint
no
blame
of
mine
said
the
injured
bookseller
such
a
notion
would
never
have
come
into
my
mind
no
man
i
make
bold
to
say
is
more
particular
about
keeping
to
his
own
rank
of
life
nor
me
what
you
did
sir
you
did
out
of
the
kindness
of
your
heart
and
i
sooner
sell
up
and
go
off
to
the
end
of
the
world
than
impose
upon
a
gentleman
her
aunt
took
her
away
continued
mr
elsworthy
lowering
his
voice
and
cautiously
pointing
to
the
back
of
the
shop
she
not
bother
you
no
more
she
who
cried
the
perpetual
curate
in
sudden
consternation
he
was
utterly
bewildered
by
the
introduction
of
a
female
actor
into
the
little
drama
and
immediately
ran
over
in
his
mind
all
the
women
he
could
think
of
who
could
by
any
possibility
be
involved
in
mysterious
relations
with
his
brother
jack
she
but
a
child
said
elsworthy
pathetically
she
do
know
nothing
about
the
ways
o
the
world
if
she
was
a
bit
proud
o
being
noticed
there
was
no
harm
in
that
but
seeing
as
there
nothing
in
this
world
that
folks
wo
make
a
talk
of
when
they
started
her
aunt
as
is
very
has
took
her
away
not
as
i
meaning
no
reproach
to
you
mr
wentworth
but
she
a
loss
to
us
is
rosa
she
was
a
cheerful
little
thing
say
the
worst
of
her
said
mr
elsworthy
going
and
out
and
in
the
shop
and
i
wo
deny
as
the
place
looks
desolate
now
she
away
but
that
aint
neither
here
nor
there
it
was
for
her
good
as
my
missis
says
most
things
as
is
unpleasant
sent
for
good
they
tell
me
and
i
would
not
for
any
comfort
to
myself
have
a
talk
got
up
about
the
clergyman
by
this
time
mr
wentworth
had
awakened
to
a
sense
of
the
real
meaning
of
elsworthy
talk
he
sat
upright
on
his
chair
and
looked
into
the
face
of
the
worthy
shopkeeper
until
the
poor
man
trembled
a
talk
about
the
clergyman
said
the
curate
about
me
do
you
mean
and
what
has
little
rosa
to
do
with
me
have
you
gone
crazy
in
carlingford
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
counter
looking
at
his
trembling
adherent
looking
through
and
through
him
as
elsworthy
said
i
should
be
glad
of
an
explanation
what
does
it
mean
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
look
which
there
was
no
evading
and
the
clerk
of
st
roque
cast
an
anxious
glance
round
him
for
help
he
would
have
accepted
it
from
any
quarter
at
that
overwhelming
moment
but
there
was
not
even
an
to
divert
from
him
the
curate
terrible
eyes
i
i
do
know
i
ca
tell
how
it
got
up
said
the
unhappy
man
who
had
not
even
his
missis
in
the
parlour
as
a
moral
support
one
thing
as
i
know
is
it
was
no
blame
o
mine
i
as
good
as
went
down
on
my
knees
to
them
three
respected
ladies
when
they
come
to
inquire
i
said
as
it
was
kindness
in
you
of
the
child
home
and
mean
nothing
more
i
ask
you
sir
what
could
i
do
cried
mr
elsworthy
folks
in
carlingford
will
talk
o
two
straws
if
they
up
grange
lane
on
the
same
breath
o
wind
i
could
do
no
more
nor
contradict
it
cried
rosa
guardian
getting
excited
in
his
and
to
save
your
feelings
mr
wentworth
and
put
it
out
o
folks
power
to
talk
the
missis
has
been
and
took
her
away
to
save
my
feelings
said
the
curate
with
a
laugh
of
contempt
and
vexation
and
impatience
which
it
was
not
pleasant
to
hear
at
another
moment
an
accusation
so
ridiculous
would
have
troubled
him
very
little
but
just
now
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
insight
he
saw
all
the
complications
which
might
spring
out
of
it
to
confuse
further
the
path
which
he
already
felt
to
be
so
burdened
i
tell
you
what
elsworthy
said
mr
wentworth
if
you
do
want
to
make
me
your
enemy
instead
of
your
friend
you
send
for
this
child
instantly
without
a
day
delay
tell
your
wife
that
my
orders
are
that
she
should
come
back
directly
feelings
do
the
people
in
carlingford
think
me
an
idiot
i
wonder
said
the
curate
walking
up
and
down
to
relieve
his
mind
i
do
know
sir
i
sure
said
elsworthy
who
thought
some
answer
was
required
of
him
to
tell
the
truth
rosa
uncle
felt
a
little
spiteful
he
did
not
see
matters
in
exactly
the
same
light
as
mr
wentworth
did
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
after
all
lay
a
thrill
of
awakened
ambition
kings
and
princes
had
been
known
to
marry
far
out
of
their
degree
for
the
sake
of
a
beautiful
face
and
why
a
perpetual
curate
should
be
so
much
more
lofty
in
his
sentiments
puzzled
and
irritated
the
clerk
of
st
roque
there
aint
a
worm
but
will
turn
when
he
trod
upon
said
mr
elsworthy
to
himself
and
when
his
temper
was
roused
he
became
impertinent
according
to
the
manner
of
his
kind
mr
wentworth
gave
him
a
quick
look
struck
by
the
changed
tone
but
unable
to
make
out
whether
it
might
not
be
stupidity
you
understand
what
i
mean
elsworthy
he
said
with
his
loftiest
air
if
rosa
does
not
return
instantly
i
shall
be
seriously
offended
how
you
and
your
friends
could
be
such
utter
idiots
as
to
get
up
this
ridiculous
fiction
i
ca
conceive
but
the
sooner
it
over
the
better
i
expect
to
see
her
back
said
the
curate
taking
up
his
bag
and
looking
with
an
absolute
despotism
which
exasperated
the
man
in
elsworthy
face
you
may
be
sure
sir
if
she
knows
as
you
want
to
see
her
come
said
the
worm
which
had
been
trampled
on
and
them
as
asks
me
why
am
i
to
say
it
was
the
clergyman
orders
said
elsworthy
looking
up
in
his
turn
with
a
consciousness
of
power
that
means
a
deal
does
that
i
would
take
it
upon
me
to
say
as
much
not
of
myself
but
if
them
your
orders
mr
wentworth
it
appears
to
me
elsworthy
said
the
curate
who
was
inwardly
in
a
towering
passion
though
outwardly
calm
enough
either
that
been
drinking
or
that
you
mean
to
be
impertinent
which
is
it
me
drinking
sir
cried
the
shopkeeper
if
i
had
been
one
as
was
given
that
way
i
would
have
attended
to
your
interests
not
as
i
have
done
there
aint
another
man
in
carlingford
as
has
stood
up
for
his
clergyman
as
i
have
and
as
for
little
rosa
sir
most
folks
as
had
right
notions
would
have
inquired
into
that
but
being
as
i
trusted
in
you
i
was
the
one
to
make
any
talk
i
said
to
everybody
as
has
asked
me
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
kindness
i
do
say
as
i
had
my
own
thoughts
for
gentlemen
go
walking
up
grange
lane
with
a
pretty
little
creature
like
that
all
for
nothing
but
instead
o
making
anything
of
that
or
leading
of
you
on
or
putting
it
in
the
child
head
to
give
you
encouragement
what
was
it
i
did
but
send
her
away
afore
you
came
home
that
you
be
led
into
temptation
and
instead
of
feelin
grateful
you
say
been
drinking
it
a
thing
as
i
scorn
to
answer
said
mr
elsworthy
there
aint
no
need
to
make
any
reply
all
carlingford
knows
but
as
for
rosa
if
it
is
understood
plain
between
us
that
it
your
wish
i
aint
the
man
to
interfere
continued
rosa
guardian
with
a
smile
which
drove
the
curate
frantic
but
she
has
got
no
father
poor
thing
and
it
my
business
to
look
after
her
and
i
not
bring
her
back
mr
wentworth
unless
it
understood
between
us
plain
strong
language
forcible
but
unclerical
was
on
the
curate
lips
and
it
was
only
with
an
effort
that
he
restrained
himself
look
here
elsworthy
he
said
it
will
be
better
for
you
not
to
exasperate
me
you
understand
perfectly
what
i
mean
i
repeat
rosa
must
come
back
and
that
instantly
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
explain
to
you
why
i
insist
upon
this
for
you
comprehend
it
pshaw
do
let
us
have
any
more
of
this
absurdity
he
exclaimed
impatiently
no
more
i
tell
you
your
wife
is
not
such
a
fool
let
anybody
who
inquires
about
me
understand
that
i
have
come
back
and
am
quite
able
to
account
for
all
my
actions
said
the
curate
shouldering
his
bag
he
was
just
about
leaving
the
shop
when
elsworthy
rushed
after
him
in
an
access
of
alarm
and
repentance
one
moment
sir
cried
the
shopkeeper
there
aint
no
offence
mr
wentworth
i
am
sure
there
aint
nobody
in
carlingford
as
means
better
or
would
do
as
much
for
his
clergyman
one
moment
sir
there
was
one
thing
i
forgot
to
mention
mr
wodehouse
sir
has
been
took
bad
there
was
a
message
up
a
couple
of
hours
ago
to
know
when
you
was
expected
home
he
had
a
stroke
and
they
do
think
as
he
get
over
it
being
a
man
of
a
full
of
body
said
mr
elsworthy
in
haste
lest
the
curate
should
break
in
on
his
unfinished
speech
makes
it
dangerous
i
had
my
fears
this
long
time
past
a
stroke
said
the
curate
a
fit
do
you
mean
when
and
how
and
good
heavens
to
think
that
you
have
been
wasting
my
time
with
rubbish
and
knew
this
mr
wentworth
tossed
down
his
again
and
wiped
his
forehead
nervously
he
had
forgotten
his
real
anxiety
in
the
irritation
of
the
moment
now
it
returned
upon
him
with
double
force
how
did
it
come
on
he
asked
and
when
and
stood
waiting
for
the
answer
with
a
world
of
other
questions
which
he
could
not
put
to
elsworthy
hanging
on
his
lips
i
have
a
deal
of
respect
for
that
family
sir
said
elsworthy
they
have
had
troubles
as
few
folks
in
carlingford
know
of
how
close
they
have
kep
things
to
be
sure
but
not
so
close
as
them
that
has
good
memories
and
can
put
two
and
two
together
could
call
to
mind
my
opinion
sir
if
you
believe
me
said
the
clerk
of
st
roque
approaching
close
to
the
curate
ear
is
that
it
something
concerning
the
son
the
son
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
troubled
look
then
after
a
pause
he
added
as
if
his
exclamation
had
been
an
oversight
what
son
has
mr
wodehouse
a
son
to
think
as
they
should
have
been
so
close
with
the
clergyman
said
elsworthy
innocently
though
he
aint
no
credit
that
they
should
talk
of
him
he
been
gone
out
o
carlingford
nigh
upon
twenty
year
but
he
aint
dead
for
all
that
and
i
told
as
he
been
seen
about
grange
lane
this
last
spring
i
am
one
as
hears
all
the
talk
that
on
being
as
you
might
say
in
a
public
position
of
life
such
a
thing
might
maybe
come
to
your
ears
sir
he
continued
looking
inquisitively
in
mr
wentworth
face
but
wherever
he
is
you
may
be
sure
it
something
about
him
as
has
brought
on
this
attack
on
the
old
man
it
was
last
night
as
he
was
took
so
bad
and
a
couple
of
hours
ago
a
message
came
up
miss
wodehouse
as
is
the
nicest
lady
in
grange
lane
and
a
great
friend
to
me
had
took
a
panic
and
she
was
for
you
the
man
said
and
would
take
no
denial
if
i
had
known
where
you
was
to
be
found
i
have
sent
word
send
down
my
bag
to
my
house
said
the
curate
hastily
interrupting
him
do
forget
what
i
said
about
the
other
matter
mr
wentworth
went
out
of
the
shop
with
a
disagreeable
impression
that
elsworthy
had
been
examining
his
face
like
an
inquisitor
and
was
already
forming
conclusions
from
what
he
had
seen
there
he
went
away
hurriedly
with
a
great
many
vague
fears
in
his
mind
mr
sudden
illness
seemed
to
him
a
kind
of
repetition
and
echo
of
the
squire
and
in
the
troubled
and
uncertain
state
of
his
thoughts
he
got
to
confusing
them
together
in
the
centre
of
this
whirl
of
unknown
disaster
and
perplexity
perhaps
even
thus
it
was
not
all
bitterness
to
the
young
man
to
feel
his
family
united
with
that
of
lucy
wodehouse
he
went
down
grange
lane
in
the
summer
darkness
under
the
faint
stars
full
of
anxiety
and
alarm
yet
not
without
a
thrill
in
his
heart
a
sweeter
of
conscious
agitation
in
the
knowledge
that
he
was
hastening
to
her
presence
sudden
breaks
in
his
thoughts
revealed
her
as
if
behind
a
curtain
rising
to
receive
him
giving
him
her
hand
meeting
his
look
with
a
smile
so
that
on
the
whole
neither
distress
nor
jack
alarming
call
nor
his
father
attack
nor
mr
wodehouse
illness
nor
the
general
atmosphere
of
vexation
and
trouble
surrounding
his
way
could
succeed
in
making
the
young
man
totally
wretched
he
had
this
little
stronghold
of
his
own
to
retire
into
the
world
could
not
fall
to
pieces
so
long
as
he
continued
with
eager
steps
to
devour
the
road
which
led
to
mr
wodehouse
before
he
had
reached
that
goal
however
he
met
a
group
who
were
evidently
returning
from
some
little
dinner
in
grange
lane
mr
wentworth
took
off
his
hat
hastily
in
recognition
of
mrs
morgan
who
was
walking
by
her
husband
side
with
a
hood
over
her
head
instead
of
a
bonnet
the
curate
who
was
a
man
of
taste
could
not
help
observing
even
in
the
darkness
and
amid
all
his
preoccupations
how
utterly
the
trimmings
of
her
were
out
of
accordance
with
the
serious
countenance
of
the
rector
wife
who
was
a
little
heated
with
her
walk
she
was
a
good
woman
but
she
was
not
fair
to
look
upon
and
it
occurred
to
mr
wentworth
to
wonder
if
lucy
were
to
wait
ten
years
for
him
would
the
youthful
grace
dry
and
wither
out
of
her
like
this
and
then
all
at
once
another
idea
flashed
upon
his
mind
without
any
wish
of
his
like
the
unhappy
lover
in
the
ballad
he
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
temptation
how
there
looked
him
in
the
face
an
angel
beautiful
and
bright
and
how
he
knew
it
was
a
fiend
of
course
the
rectory
will
go
to
frank
he
could
not
tell
why
at
that
moment
the
words
rang
into
his
ear
with
such
a
penetrating
sound
that
he
hated
himself
for
being
able
to
think
of
such
a
possibility
made
no
difference
it
came
darting
and
tingling
into
his
mind
like
one
of
those
suggestions
of
blasphemy
which
the
devils
whispered
in
christian
ear
as
he
went
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
he
went
on
faster
than
ever
to
escape
from
it
scarcely
observing
that
mrs
morgan
instead
of
simply
acknowledging
his
bow
as
she
passed
stopped
to
shake
hands
and
to
say
how
glad
she
was
he
had
come
back
again
he
thought
of
it
afterwards
with
wonder
and
a
strange
gratitude
the
rector
wife
was
not
like
the
conventional
type
of
a
pitying
angel
and
even
had
she
been
so
he
had
not
time
to
recognise
her
at
that
moment
as
he
went
struggling
with
his
demons
to
mr
wodehouse
green
door
chapter
xxi
when
the
green
door
was
opened
mr
wentworth
saw
at
a
glance
that
there
was
agitation
and
trouble
in
the
house
lights
were
twinkling
irregularly
in
the
windows
here
and
there
but
the
family
apartment
the
cheerful
which
generally
threw
its
steady
cheerful
blaze
over
the
dark
garden
shone
but
faintly
with
lights
and
undrawn
curtains
it
was
evident
at
a
glance
that
the
room
was
deserted
and
its
usual
occupants
engaged
elsewhere
very
bad
sir
said
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
the
young
ladies
is
both
with
him
and
a
hired
nurse
come
in
besides
the
doctor
do
seem
to
have
no
great
hopes
but
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
know
as
you
have
come
back
miss
wodehouse
wanted
you
very
bad
an
hour
or
two
ago
for
they
thought
as
master
was
reviving
and
could
understand
i
go
and
let
them
know
you
are
here
do
disturb
them
unless
i
can
be
of
use
said
mr
wentworth
the
look
of
the
house
and
the
atmosphere
of
distress
and
anxiety
about
it
chilled
him
suddenly
his
visions
and
hopes
seemed
guilty
and
selfish
as
he
went
slowly
up
those
familiar
steps
and
into
the
house
over
which
the
shadow
of
death
seemed
already
lying
he
went
by
himself
into
the
forsaken
where
two
neglected
candles
were
burning
feebly
in
a
corner
and
the
wistful
sky
looking
in
as
if
to
ask
why
the
domestic
temple
was
thus
left
open
and
uncared
for
after
the
first
moment
he
went
hastily
to
the
windows
and
drew
down
the
blinds
in
a
kind
of
tender
impatience
he
could
not
bear
that
anything
in
the
world
even
her
father
danger
should
discompose
the
sweet
good
order
of
the
place
where
lucy
image
dwelt
there
was
a
chair
and
her
basket
of
work
and
on
the
little
table
a
book
marked
with
such
as
youthful
readers
love
to
make
and
by
degrees
that
breath
of
lucy
lingering
in
the
silent
room
overcame
its
dreariness
and
the
painful
sense
of
desertion
which
had
struck
him
at
first
he
hovered
about
that
corner
where
her
usual
place
was
feeling
in
his
heart
that
lucy
in
trouble
was
dearer
if
possible
than
lucy
in
happiness
and
hung
over
her
chair
with
a
mixture
of
reverence
and
tenderness
and
yearning
which
could
never
be
expressed
in
words
it
was
the
divinest
phase
of
love
which
was
in
his
mind
at
the
moment
for
he
was
not
thinking
of
himself
but
of
her
and
of
how
he
could
succour
and
comfort
her
and
interpose
his
own
true
heart
and
life
between
her
and
all
trouble
it
was
at
this
moment
that
lucy
herself
entered
the
room
she
came
in
softly
and
surprised
him
in
the
overflowing
of
his
heart
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
as
usual
and
smiled
perhaps
less
brightly
but
that
of
course
arose
from
the
circumstances
of
the
house
and
her
voice
was
very
measured
and
steady
when
she
spoke
less
variable
than
of
old
what
was
it
she
said
mr
wentworth
unconsciously
left
the
neighbourhood
of
that
chair
over
which
he
had
been
bending
which
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
leaned
his
head
upon
and
perhaps
even
kissed
for
her
sake
five
minutes
before
and
grew
red
and
grew
pale
with
a
strange
revulsion
and
tumult
of
feeling
he
could
not
tell
what
the
difference
was
or
what
it
meant
he
only
felt
in
an
instant
with
a
sense
of
the
change
that
chilled
him
to
the
heart
as
if
somehow
a
wall
of
ice
had
risen
between
them
he
could
see
her
through
the
transparent
veil
and
hear
her
speak
and
perceive
the
smile
which
cast
no
warmth
of
reflection
on
him
but
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
was
changed
lucy
herself
to
her
own
consciousness
trembled
and
faltered
and
felt
as
if
her
voice
and
her
looks
must
betray
an
amount
of
emotion
which
she
would
have
died
rather
than
show
but
then
lucy
had
rehearsed
this
scene
before
and
knew
all
she
intended
by
it
whereas
upon
the
curate
in
his
little
flush
and
overflow
of
tenderness
it
fell
like
a
sudden
earthquake
rending
his
fair
edifice
of
happiness
asunder
and
casting
him
out
into
unexpected
darkness
sudden
confusion
mortification
even
a
sense
of
injury
and
bitterness
came
swelling
over
his
heart
as
he
set
a
chair
for
her
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
corner
in
which
he
had
been
indulging
such
vain
and
unwarrantable
dreams
it
happened
yesterday
said
lucy
we
have
not
been
quite
able
to
make
out
what
was
the
cause
at
least
have
not
been
able
to
find
it
out
the
clerks
at
the
office
say
it
was
something
about
but
that
does
not
matter
she
went
on
with
her
sweet
politeness
you
care
for
the
details
i
sometimes
fancy
mary
knows
more
than
she
tells
me
and
i
think
you
are
in
her
confidence
mr
wentworth
but
i
am
not
going
to
ask
you
any
questions
the
doctors
say
he
is
not
suffering
so
much
as
he
seems
to
be
it
is
terrible
to
see
him
lie
there
not
knowing
any
of
us
said
lucy
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
but
you
thought
him
better
some
time
ago
said
the
curate
whose
words
choked
him
and
who
could
not
endure
to
speak
yes
about
six
said
lucy
he
tried
to
speak
and
put
mary
in
a
great
fright
i
can
not
tell
why
would
you
be
good
enough
mr
wentworth
she
went
on
hastily
with
a
strange
mixture
of
earnestness
and
coldness
if
you
know
of
anything
she
is
keeping
secret
to
bid
her
tell
me
i
am
able
to
bear
anything
there
may
be
to
bear
surely
as
well
as
she
is
who
has
had
no
trouble
said
lucy
softly
and
for
a
moment
she
wavered
in
her
fixed
composure
and
the
wall
of
ice
moved
as
if
it
might
fall
nor
you
said
the
curate
bending
anxiously
forward
to
look
into
her
eyes
he
was
inexpressibly
moved
and
agitated
by
the
inference
which
perhaps
no
listener
less
intensely
concerned
would
have
drawn
from
what
lucy
said
he
could
not
bear
that
she
should
have
any
trouble
which
he
might
not
do
something
to
relieve
her
of
oh
no
nor
i
said
lucy
quickly
and
in
that
moment
the
softening
of
tone
disappeared
entirely
mary
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
mr
wentworth
i
will
go
and
relieve
her
presently
papa
is
asleep
just
now
and
i
was
giving
some
directions
when
you
came
in
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
look
after
that
poor
woman
at
no
she
still
keeps
living
on
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
her
today
she
misses
me
when
i
do
go
said
lucy
with
a
very
little
unconscious
sigh
would
you
see
her
please
if
you
have
time
yes
certainly
said
the
curate
and
then
there
was
a
pause
is
there
nothing
but
this
that
you
will
let
me
do
for
you
he
asked
trusting
to
his
looks
to
show
the
heart
which
at
this
moment
he
was
so
much
tempted
to
disclose
to
her
but
dared
not
and
even
in
all
her
trouble
lucy
was
too
much
of
a
woman
to
neglect
an
opportunity
so
tempting
thank
you
she
said
yes
there
are
those
poor
little
bertrams
i
was
to
have
seen
today
if
you
would
be
so
very
good
as
to
send
some
one
to
them
lucy
lifted
her
eyes
only
as
she
ended
this
little
speech
she
had
meant
it
cruelly
to
be
sure
and
the
arrow
had
gone
home
but
when
she
met
the
look
that
was
fixed
on
her
after
her
little
shaft
was
fired
lucy
resolution
faltered
the
tears
came
rushing
to
her
eyes
so
hot
and
rapid
that
she
could
not
restrain
them
some
trouble
of
her
own
gave
poignancy
to
that
outbreak
of
filial
grief
papa
is
so
very
ill
she
said
with
a
sob
as
a
scalding
drop
fell
upon
her
hand
and
then
got
up
suddenly
afraid
of
the
consequences
but
the
curate
mortified
wounded
and
disheartened
as
he
was
had
no
comprehension
either
of
the
bitterness
or
the
relenting
that
was
in
lucy
thoughts
rosa
elsworthy
did
not
so
much
as
occur
to
him
in
all
his
confused
wonderings
he
went
after
her
to
the
door
too
much
perplexed
and
distressed
to
be
indignant
as
his
first
impulse
was
she
turned
half
round
with
a
tremulous
little
inclination
of
her
head
which
was
all
the
she
could
venture
on
but
the
young
man
was
too
much
disturbed
to
permit
this
you
will
give
me
your
hand
surely
he
said
taking
it
and
holding
it
fast
a
hand
so
different
from
that
weak
woman
hand
that
clung
to
gerald
without
any
force
to
hold
him
in
wentworth
rectory
those
reluctant
fingers
so
firm
and
so
soft
which
scorned
any
struggle
to
withdraw
themselves
but
remained
passive
in
his
with
a
more
effectual
protest
still
against
his
grasp
wrung
the
very
heart
of
the
perpetual
curate
he
let
them
go
with
a
sigh
of
vexation
and
disappointment
since
that
is
all
i
can
do
i
will
do
it
he
said
that
or
anything
else
she
had
left
him
almost
before
the
words
were
said
and
it
was
in
a
very
disconsolate
mood
that
he
turned
back
into
the
deserted
to
tell
the
truth
he
forgot
everything
else
for
the
moment
asking
himself
what
it
could
mean
and
walked
about
stumbling
over
the
chairs
feeling
all
his
little
edifice
of
personal
consolation
falling
to
the
winds
and
not
caring
much
though
everything
else
should
follow
he
was
in
this
state
of
mind
when
miss
wodehouse
came
to
him
moving
with
noiseless
steps
as
everybody
did
in
the
stricken
house
oh
mr
wentworth
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
said
that
mild
woman
holding
out
both
her
hands
to
him
she
was
too
much
agitated
to
say
anything
more
she
was
not
equal
to
the
emergency
or
any
emergency
but
sank
down
on
a
chair
and
relieved
herself
by
tears
while
the
curate
stood
anxiously
by
waiting
for
what
she
had
to
say
to
him
my
father
is
very
ill
she
said
like
lucy
through
her
crying
i
know
what
good
anybody
can
do
but
thank
god
you
come
home
now
i
shall
feel
i
have
somebody
to
apply
to
whatever
happens
said
poor
miss
wodehouse
drying
the
eyes
that
were
suffused
again
the
next
moment
her
helpless
distress
did
not
overwhelm
the
spectator
like
lucy
restrained
trouble
but
that
was
natural
enough
tell
me
about
it
said
mr
wentworth
the
cause
can
i
guess
at
the
cause
it
is
something
about
your
oh
hush
do
say
his
name
cried
miss
wodehouse
yes
yes
what
else
could
it
be
oh
mr
wentworth
will
you
close
the
door
please
and
see
that
there
no
one
about
i
dare
not
speak
to
you
till
i
am
sure
there
no
one
listening
not
that
i
suspect
anybody
of
listening
said
the
distressed
woman
but
one
never
knows
i
am
afraid
it
is
all
my
fault
she
continued
getting
up
suddenly
to
see
that
the
windows
were
closed
i
ought
to
have
sent
him
away
instead
of
putting
my
trouble
upon
you
and
now
he
is
in
greater
danger
than
ever
oh
mr
wentworth
i
meant
it
for
the
best
and
now
unless
you
can
help
us
i
do
know
what
i
am
to
do
i
can
not
help
you
unless
you
tell
me
what
is
wrong
said
the
curate
making
her
sit
down
and
drawing
a
chair
close
to
her
he
took
her
hand
by
way
of
compelling
her
attention
a
fair
soft
hand
too
in
its
restless
anxious
way
he
held
it
in
a
brotherly
grasp
trying
to
restore
her
to
coherence
and
induce
her
to
speak
i
do
know
enough
about
business
to
tell
you
she
said
he
was
in
danger
when
i
threw
him
upon
your
charity
and
oh
mr
wentworth
thank
you
thank
you
a
thousand
times
for
taking
him
in
like
a
brother
if
lucy
only
knew
but
i
do
feel
as
if
i
dared
to
tell
her
and
yet
i
sometimes
think
i
ought
for
your
i
mean
for
all
our
sakes
yes
i
will
try
to
explain
it
if
i
can
but
i
ca
indeed
i
do
understand
cried
the
poor
lady
in
despair
it
is
something
about
a
bill
it
was
something
about
a
bill
before
and
i
thought
i
could
soften
papa
and
persuade
him
to
be
merciful
but
it
has
all
turned
to
greater
wretchedness
and
misery
the
first
one
was
paid
you
know
and
i
thought
papa
might
relent
but
do
cast
us
off
mr
wentworth
do
go
and
denounce
him
you
might
but
you
will
not
it
would
be
justice
i
acknowledge
cried
the
weeping
woman
but
there
is
something
higher
than
justice
even
in
this
world
you
are
younger
than
i
am
and
so
is
lucy
but
you
are
better
than
me
you
young
people
and
you
must
be
more
merciful
too
i
have
seen
you
going
among
the
poor
people
and
among
the
sick
and
i
could
not
have
done
it
and
you
wo
forsake
me
oh
mr
wentworth
you
wo
forsake
me
when
you
know
that
my
trouble
is
greater
than
i
can
bear
i
will
not
forsake
you
said
the
curate
but
tell
me
what
it
is
i
have
been
summoned
to
carlingford
by
my
brother
and
i
am
bewildered
and
disturbed
beyond
what
i
can
tell
you
by
your
brother
said
miss
wodehouse
with
her
unfailing
instinct
of
interest
in
other
people
i
hope
there
is
no
trouble
in
your
own
family
mr
wentworth
one
gets
so
selfish
when
one
is
in
great
distress
i
hope
he
is
not
ill
it
sounds
as
if
there
was
comfort
in
the
very
name
of
a
brother
said
the
gentle
woman
drying
her
tears
and
i
hope
it
is
so
with
you
but
it
is
always
so
i
hope
you
will
find
he
is
better
when
you
get
home
i
am
very
very
sorry
to
hear
that
you
are
in
trouble
too
mr
wentworth
got
up
from
his
chair
with
a
sigh
of
impatience
will
nobody
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
he
said
mr
wodehouse
is
ill
and
there
is
some
mysterious
cause
for
it
and
you
are
miserable
and
there
is
a
cause
for
that
too
and
i
am
to
do
something
to
set
things
right
without
knowing
what
is
wrong
will
you
not
tell
me
what
is
it
has
your
oh
mr
wentworth
do
say
anybody
name
do
speak
so
loud
there
may
be
a
servant
in
the
staircase
or
something
cried
miss
wodehouse
i
hear
somebody
coming
now
she
got
up
to
listen
her
face
growing
white
with
panic
and
went
a
few
steps
towards
the
door
and
then
tottered
into
another
chair
unable
to
command
herself
a
certain
sick
thrill
of
apprehension
came
over
the
curate
too
as
he
hastened
forward
he
could
not
tell
what
he
was
afraid
of
or
whether
it
was
only
the
accumulated
agitation
of
the
day
that
made
him
weak
somebody
was
coming
up
the
stairs
and
towards
the
room
with
a
footstep
more
careless
than
those
stealthy
steps
with
which
all
the
servants
were
stealing
about
the
house
whoever
he
was
he
stopped
at
the
door
a
moment
and
then
looked
cautiously
in
when
he
saw
the
figure
of
the
curate
in
the
imperfect
light
he
withdrew
his
head
again
as
if
deliberating
with
himself
and
then
with
a
sudden
rush
came
in
and
shut
the
door
after
him
confound
these
servants
they
always
prowling
about
the
house
said
the
he
was
an
alarming
apparition
in
his
great
beard
and
his
shabbiness
and
the
fugitive
look
he
had
i
could
help
it
he
broke
forth
with
a
spontaneous
burst
of
apology
and
i
heard
he
was
ill
and
i
could
keep
quiet
how
is
he
you
do
mean
to
say
my
fault
molly
ca
you
speak
to
me
how
could
i
tell
i
should
find
you
and
the
parson
alone
here
and
all
safe
i
might
have
been
risking
my
my
freedom
everything
i
care
for
but
when
i
heard
he
was
ill
i
could
stay
quiet
is
he
dying
what
the
matter
molly
ca
you
speak
oh
mr
wentworth
somebody
will
see
him
cried
miss
wodehouse
wringing
her
hands
oh
tom
tom
how
could
you
do
it
suppose
somebody
was
to
come
in
john
or
somebody
if
you
care
for
your
own
life
oh
go
away
go
away
they
ca
touch
my
life
said
the
stranger
sullenly
i
daresay
she
does
know
that
nor
the
parson
need
not
look
superior
there
are
more
people
concerned
than
i
but
if
i
risked
everything
to
hear
you
may
surely
tell
me
how
the
old
man
is
if
it
was
love
that
brought
you
said
poor
miss
wodehouse
but
oh
tom
you
know
i
ca
believe
that
he
is
very
very
ill
and
it
is
you
that
have
done
it
cried
the
mild
woman
in
a
little
gush
of
passion
you
whom
he
has
forgiven
and
forgiven
till
his
heart
is
sick
go
away
i
tell
you
go
away
from
the
house
that
you
have
shamed
oh
mr
wentworth
take
him
away
she
cried
turning
to
the
curate
with
clasped
hands
tell
him
to
hide
to
fly
or
he
be
taken
he
will
not
be
forgiven
this
time
and
if
my
father
if
my
dear
father
dies
but
when
she
got
so
far
her
agitation
interrupted
her
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
the
door
with
a
wild
look
of
terror
and
waved
her
helpless
hands
to
warn
the
intruder
away
if
he
dies
matters
will
be
altered
said
the
stranger
you
and
i
might
change
places
then
for
that
matter
i
going
away
from
carlingford
i
ca
stay
in
such
a
wretched
hole
any
longer
gout
or
something
said
the
man
with
a
tone
of
nature
breaking
through
his
bravado
it
not
anything
that
has
happened
say
so
and
i
never
trouble
you
more
oh
if
lucy
were
to
see
him
said
poor
miss
wodehouse
the
words
came
unawares
out
of
her
heart
without
any
thought
but
the
next
thing
of
which
she
was
conscious
was
that
the
perpetual
curate
had
laid
his
hand
on
the
stranger
arm
and
was
leading
him
reluctantly
away
i
will
tell
you
all
you
want
to
know
said
mr
wentworth
but
not
here
and
with
his
hand
upon
the
other
arm
moved
him
somehow
with
an
irresistible
command
half
physical
half
mental
to
the
door
before
miss
wodehouse
could
say
anything
they
were
gone
before
she
could
venture
to
draw
that
long
sighing
breath
of
relief
she
heard
the
door
below
close
and
the
retreating
footsteps
in
the
garden
but
the
sound
thankful
though
she
was
moved
her
to
another
burst
of
bitter
tears
to
think
i
should
have
to
tell
a
stranger
to
take
him
away
she
sobbed
out
of
the
anguish
of
her
heart
and
sat
weeping
over
him
with
a
relenting
that
wrung
her
tender
spirit
without
power
to
move
till
the
servant
came
up
with
alarmed
looks
to
ask
if
any
one
had
come
in
in
his
absence
oh
no
it
was
only
mr
wentworth
and
a
gentleman
who
came
to
fetch
him
said
miss
wodehouse
and
she
got
up
trembling
as
she
was
and
told
john
he
had
better
shut
up
the
house
and
go
to
bed
for
i
hope
papa
will
have
a
better
night
and
we
must
not
waste
our
strength
she
said
with
a
kind
of
woeful
smile
which
was
a
wonder
to
john
he
said
miss
wodehouse
was
a
one
to
be
sure
when
he
went
but
that
was
no
very
novel
piece
of
information
to
anybody
there
meantime
the
curate
went
down
grange
lane
with
that
strange
lodger
of
mrs
hadwin
who
had
broken
thus
into
miss
wodehouse
solitude
they
did
not
say
much
to
each
other
as
they
went
sullenly
side
by
side
down
the
silent
road
for
the
stranger
whose
feelings
were
not
complicated
by
any
very
lively
sense
of
gratitude
looked
upon
his
companion
as
a
kind
of
jailer
and
had
an
unspeakable
grudge
against
the
man
who
exercised
so
calm
an
ascendancy
over
him
though
to
be
sure
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
resist
the
moral
force
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
who
was
three
inches
taller
than
himself
and
had
the
unbroken
vigour
of
youth
and
health
to
back
him
as
for
mr
wentworth
he
went
on
without
speaking
with
a
bitterness
in
his
heart
not
to
be
expressed
his
own
personal
stronghold
of
happiness
and
consolation
had
shattered
in
pieces
in
that
evening
interview
and
as
he
went
to
his
own
house
he
asked
himself
what
he
should
find
in
it
this
wretched
man
with
whose
sins
he
had
been
hitherto
but
partially
acquainted
and
jack
with
whom
the
other
had
heaven
knew
what
horrible
connection
should
he
find
a
den
of
thieves
where
he
had
left
only
high
thoughts
and
lofty
intentions
it
was
thus
after
his
three
days
absence
that
he
returned
home
chapter
xxii
when
mr
wentworth
entered
mrs
hadwin
garden
in
the
dark
his
first
glance
up
at
the
house
showed
him
that
a
certain
change
had
passed
on
it
also
the
decorous
little
house
had
been
turned
inside
out
the
windows
of
his
own
were
open
the
blind
drawn
up
to
the
top
and
in
addition
to
his
usual
lamp
some
candles
were
flaring
wildly
in
the
draught
he
could
see
into
the
room
as
he
paused
at
the
and
was
able
to
distinguish
that
the
table
was
still
covered
as
for
dinner
and
to
catch
the
purple
gleam
of
the
light
in
the
which
occupied
the
place
of
honour
but
nobody
was
visible
in
the
room
that
and
open
apartment
stood
in
strange
contrast
with
the
rest
of
the
house
where
everything
was
dark
save
in
mrs
hadwin
own
chamber
the
curate
proceeded
on
his
way
after
that
moment
pause
with
hasty
and
impatient
steps
on
the
way
up
he
encountered
sarah
the
housemaid
who
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
stairs
to
make
a
frightened
little
curtsy
and
utter
an
alarmed
la
of
recognition
and
surprise
but
sarah
turned
round
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
herself
to
say
that
her
missis
wanted
very
bad
to
see
mr
wentworth
as
soon
as
he
came
home
but
she
was
gone
up
to
bed
now
and
did
he
think
it
would
be
a
pity
to
wake
her
up
the
curate
gave
her
only
a
little
nod
of
general
acquiescence
as
he
hurried
on
but
felt
notwithstanding
that
this
prompt
request
ready
prepared
for
his
arrival
was
a
tacit
protest
against
his
guests
and
expression
of
disapproval
mrs
hadwin
was
only
his
landlady
an
old
woman
and
not
a
particularly
wise
one
but
her
disapproval
vexed
the
perpetual
curate
it
was
a
kind
of
sign
of
the
times
those
times
in
which
it
appeared
that
everybody
was
ready
to
turn
upon
him
and
embarrass
his
path
he
had
forgotten
all
about
his
companion
as
he
hurried
into
the
familiar
room
which
was
so
little
like
itself
but
yet
was
somehow
conscious
with
annoyance
that
the
stranger
followed
him
through
its
door
the
scene
within
was
one
which
was
never
effaced
from
mr
wentworth
memory
there
were
several
bottles
upon
the
table
which
the
poor
curate
knew
by
sight
and
which
had
been
collected
in
his
little
cellar
more
for
the
benefit
of
wharfside
than
of
himself
removed
out
of
the
current
of
air
which
was
playing
freely
through
the
apartment
was
some
one
lying
on
a
sofa
with
candles
burning
on
a
table
beside
him
he
was
in
a
with
his
shirt
open
at
the
throat
and
his
languid
frame
extended
in
perfect
repose
to
catch
the
refreshment
of
the
breeze
clouds
of
languid
smoke
which
were
too
far
out
of
the
way
to
feel
the
draught
between
the
windows
curled
over
him
he
had
a
cigar
in
one
hand
which
he
had
just
taken
from
his
lips
and
with
which
he
was
faintly
waving
off
a
big
which
had
been
attracted
by
the
lights
and
a
french
novel
unmistakable
in
its
paper
cover
had
closed
upon
the
other
altogether
a
more
languid
figure
never
lay
at
rest
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
most
legitimate
retirement
he
had
the
wentworth
hair
the
which
like
all
their
other
family
features
even
down
to
their
illnesses
the
race
was
proud
of
and
a
handsome
silky
beard
he
had
lived
a
hard
life
of
pleasure
and
punishment
but
though
he
had
reached
middle
age
there
was
not
a
hair
on
the
handsome
reprobate
head
which
had
changed
out
of
its
original
colour
he
looked
languidly
up
when
the
door
opened
but
did
not
stop
the
delicate
fence
which
he
was
carrying
on
against
the
moth
nor
the
polyglot
oaths
which
he
was
swearing
at
it
softly
half
under
his
breath
frank
i
suppose
he
said
calmly
as
the
curate
came
hastily
forward
how
d
do
i
am
very
glad
you
come
back
the
country
was
very
charming
the
first
day
but
that
a
charm
that
does
last
i
suppose
you
dined
or
will
you
ring
and
order
something
he
said
turning
slowly
round
on
his
sofa
accidente
the
thing
will
kill
itself
after
all
would
you
mind
catching
it
in
your
handkerchief
before
you
sit
down
but
do
take
away
the
candles
it
too
late
to
make
any
exertion
said
the
elegant
prodigal
leaning
back
languidly
on
his
sofa
but
i
assure
you
that
light
is
half
my
life
the
curate
was
tired
heated
and
indignant
he
lifted
the
candles
away
from
the
table
and
then
put
them
back
again
too
much
excited
to
think
of
the
moth
your
arrival
must
have
been
very
sudden
he
said
throwing
himself
into
the
nearest
chair
i
was
very
much
surprised
by
your
message
it
looks
inhospitable
but
i
see
you
make
yourself
quite
at
home
perfectly
said
the
elder
brother
resuming
his
cigar
i
always
do
it
is
much
more
agreeable
for
all
parties
but
i
do
know
how
it
is
that
a
man
younger
brothers
are
always
so
rapid
and
unreasonable
in
their
movements
instead
of
saving
that
unhappy
insect
you
have
precipitated
its
fate
poor
thing
and
it
had
no
soul
said
the
intruder
with
a
tone
of
pathos
the
scene
altogether
was
a
curious
one
snugly
sheltered
from
the
draught
but
enjoying
the
coolness
of
the
atmosphere
which
it
produced
lay
the
figure
on
the
sofa
at
perfect
ease
and
leisure
with
the
light
shed
brightly
upon
him
on
his
shining
beard
the
white
cool
expanse
of
linen
at
his
breast
and
the
bright
hues
of
his
near
him
fatigued
dusty
indignant
and
perplexed
sat
the
curate
with
the
night
air
playing
upon
him
and
moving
his
disordered
hair
on
his
forehead
while
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
hovered
the
stranger
who
had
followed
mr
wentworth
a
broad
shabby
indistinct
figure
who
stood
with
his
back
to
the
others
looking
vaguely
out
of
the
window
into
the
darkness
over
these
two
the
night
air
blew
with
no
small
force
between
the
open
windows
making
the
candles
on
the
centre
table
flare
wildly
and
flapping
the
white
tablecloth
an
occasional
puff
from
the
cigar
floated
now
and
then
across
the
room
it
was
a
pause
before
the
storm
i
was
about
to
say
said
the
perpetual
curate
that
though
it
might
seem
inhospitable
the
first
thing
i
had
to
ask
was
what
brought
you
here
and
why
did
you
send
for
me
do
be
abrupt
pray
said
jack
taking
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
slightly
waving
the
hand
that
held
it
do
let
us
plunge
into
business
all
at
once
you
bring
a
sense
of
fatigue
into
the
room
with
you
and
the
atmosphere
was
delightful
a
little
while
ago
i
flatter
myself
i
know
how
to
enjoy
the
cool
of
the
evening
suppose
you
were
to
ah
refresh
yourself
a
little
he
said
with
a
disapproving
glance
at
his
brother
dusty
boots
before
we
begin
to
talk
of
our
affairs
the
curate
of
st
roque
got
up
from
his
chair
feeling
that
he
had
an
unchristian
inclination
to
kick
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
as
he
could
not
do
that
he
shut
the
window
behind
him
emphatically
and
extinguished
the
flaring
candles
on
the
centre
table
i
detest
a
draught
said
the
perpetual
curate
which
unfortunately
was
not
a
statement
entirely
founded
on
fact
though
so
far
true
in
the
present
instance
that
he
hated
anything
originated
by
the
intruder
i
have
hurried
home
in
reply
to
your
message
and
i
should
be
glad
to
know
what
it
means
now
that
i
am
here
what
you
are
in
trouble
about
and
why
you
come
to
me
and
what
you
have
to
do
with
him
but
you
need
not
have
deranged
the
temperature
said
jack
impetuosity
always
distresses
me
all
these
are
questions
which
it
will
take
some
time
to
answer
let
me
persuade
you
in
the
first
place
to
make
yourself
comfortable
do
mind
me
i
am
at
the
crisis
of
my
novel
which
is
very
interesting
i
have
just
been
thinking
how
it
might
be
adapted
for
the
stage
there
a
character
that
fechter
could
make
anything
of
now
my
dear
fellow
do
stand
on
ceremony
take
a
bath
and
change
your
dress
and
in
the
mean
time
there
will
be
time
to
cook
something
the
cookery
here
is
not
bad
for
the
country
after
that
we
discuss
all
our
news
i
daresay
our
friend
there
is
in
no
hurry
said
the
elder
brother
opening
his
book
and
puffing
slowly
towards
the
curate
the
languid
smoke
of
his
cigar
but
by
jove
i
in
a
hurry
though
said
that
nameless
individual
coming
forward
it
all
very
well
for
you
you
put
a
man
up
to
everything
that
dangerous
and
then
you
leave
him
in
the
lurch
and
say
it
do
matter
i
daresay
it
do
matter
to
you
all
that
you
done
has
been
to
share
the
profit
you
nothing
to
do
with
the
danger
but
i
savage
and
i
do
mean
to
stand
it
any
more
said
the
stranger
his
great
chest
expanding
with
a
panting
breath
he
too
looked
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
seize
the
languid
spectator
in
his
teeth
and
shake
some
human
feeling
into
him
jack
wentworth
raised
his
eyebrows
and
looked
at
him
as
he
might
have
looked
at
a
wild
beast
in
a
rage
sit
down
savage
and
be
quiet
he
said
why
should
i
trouble
myself
about
you
any
fool
could
get
into
your
scrape
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
interfering
in
a
case
of
common
crime
what
i
do
i
do
out
of
pity
he
continued
with
an
air
of
superiority
quite
different
from
his
tone
to
his
brother
but
this
look
which
had
answered
before
was
not
successful
by
jove
i
savage
said
the
other
setting
his
teeth
and
i
know
enough
of
your
ways
to
teach
you
different
behaviour
the
parson
has
treated
me
like
a
gentleman
like
what
i
used
to
be
though
he
do
like
me
but
you
by
jove
it
was
only
my
own
name
i
signed
after
all
he
continued
after
a
pause
lowering
his
voice
but
you
you
blackleg
stop
a
little
said
the
curate
rising
up
though
you
seem
both
to
have
forgotten
it
this
is
my
room
i
do
mean
to
have
any
altercations
here
i
have
taken
you
in
for
the
sake
of
your
family
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
momentary
gasp
and
you
have
come
because
you
are
my
brother
i
do
deny
any
natural
claims
upon
me
but
i
am
master
of
my
own
house
and
my
own
leisure
get
up
jack
and
tell
me
what
you
want
when
i
understand
what
it
is
you
can
lounge
at
your
will
but
in
the
mean
time
get
up
and
explain
and
as
for
you
wodehouse
jack
wentworth
faced
round
on
his
sofa
and
then
with
a
kind
of
involuntary
motion
slid
his
feet
to
the
ground
he
looked
at
his
brother
with
extreme
amazement
as
he
closed
his
novel
and
tossed
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
it
much
better
not
to
mention
names
he
said
in
a
way
our
friend
here
is
under
a
temporary
cloud
his
name
in
fact
is
smith
i
think
but
as
he
spoke
he
sat
upright
a
little
startled
to
find
that
frank
whom
he
remembered
only
as
a
lad
was
no
longer
to
be
coerced
and
concussed
as
for
the
other
he
came
forward
with
the
alacrity
of
a
man
who
began
to
see
some
hope
by
jove
my
name
wodehouse
though
he
said
in
the
argumentative
tone
which
seemed
habitual
to
him
his
voice
came
low
and
grumbling
through
his
beard
he
was
not
of
the
class
of
triumphant
sinners
whatever
wickedness
he
might
be
capable
of
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
long
long
ago
fallen
out
of
the
butterfly
stage
of
dissipation
and
had
now
to
be
the
doer
of
dirty
work
despised
and
hustled
about
by
such
men
as
jack
wentworth
the
wages
of
sin
had
long
been
bitter
enough
though
he
had
neither
any
hope
of
freeing
himself
nor
any
wish
to
do
so
but
he
took
up
a
grumbling
tone
of
as
soon
as
he
had
an
opening
the
parson
treats
me
like
a
gentleman
like
what
i
used
to
be
he
repeated
coming
into
the
light
and
drawing
a
chair
towards
the
table
my
name
is
wodehouse
it
my
own
name
that
i
have
signed
after
all
by
jove
said
the
unlucky
prodigal
it
seemed
to
give
him
a
little
comfort
to
say
that
over
again
as
if
to
convince
himself
as
for
wodehouse
i
partly
understand
what
he
has
done
said
the
curate
it
appears
likely
that
he
has
killed
his
father
by
the
way
but
i
suppose
you
do
count
that
it
is
forgery
in
the
mean
time
i
understand
as
much
it
my
name
as
well
as
his
by
jove
interrupted
hastily
the
stranger
under
his
breath
such
strong
terms
are
unnecessary
said
jack
everybody
knows
that
bills
are
drawn
to
be
renewed
and
nursed
and
taken
care
of
had
a
great
failure
in
luck
as
it
happens
and
these
ones
have
come
down
to
this
deuced
place
and
the
old
fellow
instead
of
paying
them
like
a
gentleman
has
made
a
row
and
dropped
down
dead
or
something
i
suppose
you
do
know
any
more
than
the
women
have
told
you
the
old
man
made
a
row
in
the
office
and
went
off
in
fire
and
flame
and
gave
up
our
friend
here
to
his
partner
tender
mercies
i
sent
for
you
as
you
taken
charge
of
him
i
suppose
you
have
your
reasons
this
is
an
unlikely
corner
to
find
him
in
and
i
suppose
he
be
safer
anywhere
that
about
the
state
of
the
case
i
came
down
to
look
after
him
out
of
kind
feeling
said
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
if
you
do
mean
to
eat
any
dinner
have
a
cigar
and
what
have
you
to
do
with
each
other
what
is
the
connection
between
you
said
the
curate
of
st
roque
i
have
my
reasons
as
you
say
for
taking
an
interest
in
him
but
you
i
am
only
your
elder
brother
said
jack
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
resuming
his
place
on
the
sofa
we
understand
that
difference
business
connection
that
all
he
said
leisurely
selecting
another
cigar
from
his
case
when
he
had
lighted
it
he
turned
round
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
stranger
we
do
want
any
harm
to
happen
to
him
he
said
with
a
little
emphasis
i
have
come
here
to
protect
him
if
he
keeps
quiet
and
does
show
it
will
blow
over
the
keenest
spy
in
the
place
could
scarcely
suspect
him
to
be
here
i
have
come
entirely
on
his
account
much
to
my
own
disgust
and
yours
said
the
exquisite
with
another
shrug
he
laid
back
his
head
and
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
contemplating
the
fragrant
wreaths
of
smoke
with
the
air
of
a
man
perfectly
at
his
ease
we
do
mean
him
to
come
to
any
harm
said
jack
wentworth
and
stretched
out
his
elegant
limbs
on
the
sofa
like
a
potentate
satisfied
that
his
protection
was
enough
to
make
any
man
secure
i
too
much
in
their
secrets
by
jove
said
poor
wodehouse
in
his
beard
i
know
their
secrets
though
they
talk
so
big
it
not
any
consideration
for
me
it
to
save
themselves
by
jove
what
it
is
cried
the
indignant
drudge
of
whom
his
superior
deigned
to
take
no
notice
as
for
mr
wentworth
he
rose
from
his
seat
in
a
state
of
suppressed
indignation
which
could
not
express
itself
merely
in
words
may
i
ask
what
share
i
am
expected
to
play
in
the
drama
he
asked
pushing
his
chair
aside
in
his
excitement
the
elder
brother
turned
instinctively
and
once
more
slid
his
feet
to
the
ground
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
the
curate
pale
with
a
passion
which
he
could
not
conceal
had
something
in
his
eyes
which
brought
shame
even
to
jack
wentworth
face
you
can
betray
him
if
you
like
he
said
sulkily
i
have
no
particular
interest
in
the
matter
but
in
that
case
he
had
better
make
the
best
of
his
time
and
get
away
you
hear
said
the
making
a
sign
to
wodehouse
he
had
roused
himself
up
and
looked
now
like
a
feline
creature
preparing
for
a
spring
his
eyes
were
cast
down
but
under
the
eyelids
he
followed
his
brother
movements
with
vigilant
observation
if
you
like
you
can
betray
him
he
repeated
slowly
understanding
as
bad
men
so
often
do
the
generosities
of
the
nature
to
which
his
own
was
so
much
opposed
and
perhaps
there
was
an
undue
degree
of
exasperation
in
the
indignant
feelings
which
moved
mr
wentworth
he
kicked
off
his
dusty
boots
with
an
indecorum
quite
unusual
to
him
and
hunted
up
his
slippers
out
of
the
adjoining
room
with
perhaps
an
unnecessary
amount
of
noise
and
haste
then
he
went
and
looked
out
of
the
window
into
the
serene
summer
darkness
and
the
dewy
garden
getting
a
little
fresh
air
upon
his
heated
face
last
of
all
he
came
back
peremptory
and
decided
i
shall
not
betray
him
said
the
perpetual
curate
but
i
will
have
no
further
schemes
concocted
nor
villany
carried
on
in
my
house
if
i
consent
to
shield
him
and
if
possible
save
him
from
the
law
it
is
neither
for
his
sake
nor
yours
said
the
indignant
young
man
i
suppose
it
is
no
use
saying
anything
about
your
life
but
both
of
you
have
fathers
very
like
to
die
of
this
my
dear
fellow
said
jack
wentworth
we
have
gone
through
that
phase
ages
ago
do
be
so
much
after
date
i
have
brought
down
my
father
grey
hairs
a
hundred
times
and
i
daresay
so
has
he
do
treat
us
as
if
we
were
in
the
nursery
a
parson
of
advanced
views
like
you
should
have
something
a
little
more
novel
to
say
and
so
i
have
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
heightened
colour
there
are
capital
rooms
at
the
blue
boar
which
you
will
find
very
comfortable
i
am
sure
i
do
remember
that
we
have
ever
been
more
than
acquaintances
and
to
take
possession
of
a
man
house
in
his
absence
argues
a
high
degree
of
friendship
as
you
are
aware
it
will
be
with
difficulty
that
i
shall
find
room
for
myself
but
i
trust
if
business
requires
you
to
remain
in
carlingford
you
will
be
able
to
find
accommodation
at
the
blue
boar
the
elder
brother
grew
very
red
all
over
his
face
i
will
go
at
once
he
said
with
a
little
start
and
then
he
took
a
second
thought
it
is
a
poor
sort
of
way
of
winning
a
victory
he
said
in
contemptuous
tones
after
he
had
overcome
his
first
impulse
but
if
you
choose
that
it
is
no
matter
to
me
i
go
as
you
say
to
pack
up
is
too
much
for
my
energies
in
the
mean
time
it
wo
disturb
you
i
hope
if
i
go
on
with
my
novel
i
suppose
any
further
civilities
are
necessary
between
you
and
me
said
jack
once
more
putting
up
his
feet
on
the
sofa
he
arranged
himself
with
an
indifference
which
was
too
genuine
for
bravado
opening
his
book
and
puffing
his
cigar
with
great
coolness
he
did
all
but
turn
his
back
upon
the
others
and
drew
the
little
table
nearer
to
him
in
utter
disregard
of
the
fact
that
the
curate
was
leaning
his
arm
on
it
in
short
he
retired
from
the
contest
with
a
kind
of
grandeur
with
his
cigar
and
his
novel
and
the
candles
which
lighted
him
up
placidly
and
made
him
look
like
the
master
of
the
house
and
the
situation
there
was
a
pause
for
some
minutes
during
which
the
others
looked
on
mr
wentworth
with
a
perfectly
unreasonable
sense
of
defeat
and
poor
wodehouse
with
that
strange
kind
of
admiration
which
an
unsuccessful
naturally
feels
for
a
triumphant
rascal
they
were
in
the
shade
looking
on
and
he
in
the
light
enjoying
himself
calmly
in
his
way
the
sight
put
an
end
to
various
twinges
of
repentance
in
the
bosom
of
the
inferior
sinner
jack
wentworth
lying
on
the
sofa
in
superb
indifference
victorious
over
all
sense
of
right
did
more
to
confirm
his
humble
admirer
in
the
life
which
he
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
abandon
than
even
his
own
inclination
towards
forbidden
pleasure
he
was
dazzled
by
the
success
of
his
principal
and
in
comparison
with
that
instructive
sight
his
probable
deathbed
his
sisters
tears
and
even
his
own
present
discomfort
faded
into
insignificance
what
jack
wentworth
was
tom
wodehouse
could
never
be
but
at
least
he
could
follow
his
great
model
humbly
and
afar
off
these
sentiments
made
him
receive
but
sulkily
the
admonitions
of
the
curate
when
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
preoccupied
for
mr
wentworth
was
certainly
not
the
victor
in
this
passage
of
arms
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
help
you
out
of
this
said
the
curate
pausing
within
the
door
of
wodehouse
room
for
the
sake
of
your
friends
but
look
here
wodehouse
i
have
not
preached
to
you
hitherto
and
i
do
mean
to
do
so
now
when
a
man
has
done
a
crime
he
is
generally
past
preaching
the
law
will
punish
you
for
forging
your
father
name
it
name
as
well
as
his
by
jove
interrupted
the
culprit
sullenly
i
a
right
to
sign
it
wherever
i
please
but
the
law
said
mr
wentworth
with
emphasis
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
breaking
of
your
father
heart
if
he
dies
think
whether
the
recollection
will
be
a
comfortable
one
i
will
save
you
if
i
can
and
there
is
time
though
i
am
compromised
already
and
it
may
do
me
serious
injury
if
you
get
free
and
are
cleared
from
this
will
you
go
away
and
break
off
your
connection
with
yes
you
are
quite
right
i
mean
with
my
brother
whatever
the
connection
may
be
i
will
only
exert
myself
for
you
on
condition
that
you
promise
you
will
go
away
somehow
and
break
off
your
old
habits
and
try
if
it
is
possible
to
begin
anew
wodehouse
paused
before
he
answered
the
vision
of
jack
in
the
curate
still
dazzled
him
you
dare
say
as
much
to
your
brother
as
you
say
to
me
he
replied
after
a
while
in
his
sulky
way
but
i
a
gentleman
by
jove
as
well
as
he
is
and
he
threw
himself
down
in
a
chair
and
bit
his
nails
and
grumbled
into
his
beard
it
hard
to
ask
a
fellow
to
give
up
his
liberty
he
said
without
lifting
his
eyes
mr
wentworth
perhaps
was
a
little
contemptuous
of
the
sullen
wretch
who
already
had
involved
him
in
so
much
annoyance
and
trouble
you
can
take
your
choice
he
said
the
law
will
respect
your
liberty
less
than
i
shall
and
all
the
curate
could
not
conceal
a
certain
amount
of
disdain
by
jove
said
wodehouse
lifting
up
his
eyes
if
the
old
man
should
die
you
change
your
tone
and
then
he
stopped
short
and
looked
suspiciously
at
the
curate
there
no
will
and
i
the
heir
he
said
with
sullen
braggadocio
mr
wentworth
was
still
young
and
this
look
made
him
sick
with
disgust
and
indignation
then
you
can
take
your
chance
he
said
impatiently
making
a
hasty
step
to
the
door
he
would
not
return
though
his
ungrateful
guest
called
him
back
but
went
away
much
excited
and
disgusted
to
see
if
the
fresh
air
outside
would
restore
his
composure
on
his
way
he
again
met
sarah
who
was
hovering
about
in
a
restless
state
of
curiosity
i
made
a
bed
for
you
please
sir
in
the
little
said
sarah
and
please
cook
wants
to
know
you
have
anything
to
eat
the
question
reminded
mr
wentworth
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
luncheon
which
he
took
in
his
father
house
human
nature
which
can
bear
great
blows
with
elasticity
so
wonderful
is
apt
to
be
put
out
as
everybody
knows
by
their
most
trifling
accessories
and
a
man
naturally
feels
miserable
when
he
had
had
no
dinner
and
has
not
a
place
to
shelter
him
while
he
snatches
a
necessary
mouthful
never
mind
all
the
rooms
are
occupied
said
the
perpetual
curate
feeling
thoroughly
wretched
but
cook
and
sarah
had
arranged
all
that
being
naturally
indignant
that
their
favourite
clergyman
should
be
put
upon
by
his
disorderly
and
unexpected
guests
i
have
set
your
tray
sir
in
missis
parlour
said
sarah
opening
the
door
to
that
sanctuary
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
sense
of
relief
with
which
the
perpetual
curate
flung
himself
down
on
mrs
hadwin
sofa
deranging
a
quantity
of
cushions
and
elaborate
draperies
without
knowing
it
here
at
least
he
was
safe
from
intrusion
but
his
reflections
were
far
from
being
agreeable
as
he
ate
his
here
he
was
without
any
fault
of
his
own
plunged
into
the
midst
of
a
complication
of
disgrace
and
vice
perhaps
already
the
name
of
lucy
wodehouse
was
branded
with
her
shame
perhaps
still
more
overwhelming
infamy
might
overtake
through
that
means
the
heir
and
the
name
of
the
wentworths
and
for
himself
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
attempt
with
all
his
powers
to
defeat
justice
and
save
from
punishment
a
criminal
for
whom
it
was
impossible
to
feel
either
sympathy
or
hope
when
he
thought
of
jack
on
the
sofa
over
his
french
novel
the
heart
of
the
curate
burned
within
him
with
indignation
and
resentment
and
his
disgust
at
his
other
guest
was
if
less
intense
an
equally
painful
sensation
it
was
hard
to
waste
his
strength
and
perhaps
compromise
his
character
for
such
men
as
these
but
on
the
other
hand
he
saw
his
father
with
that
malady
of
the
wentworths
hanging
over
his
head
doing
his
best
to
live
and
last
like
a
courageous
english
gentleman
as
he
was
for
the
sake
of
the
girls
and
the
little
children
who
had
so
little
to
expect
from
jack
and
poor
stupid
mr
wodehouse
dying
of
the
crime
which
assailed
his
own
credit
as
well
as
his
son
safety
the
curate
of
st
roque
drew
a
long
breath
and
raised
himself
up
unconsciously
to
his
full
height
as
he
rose
to
go
it
was
he
against
the
world
at
the
moment
as
it
appeared
he
set
himself
to
his
uncongenial
work
with
a
heart
that
revolted
against
the
evil
cause
of
which
he
was
about
to
constitute
himself
the
champion
but
for
the
squire
who
had
misjudged
him
for
lucy
who
had
received
him
with
such
icy
smiles
and
closed
up
her
heart
against
his
entrance
sometimes
there
is
a
kind
of
bitter
sweetness
in
the
thought
of
spending
love
and
life
in
one
lavish
and
prodigal
outburst
upon
those
to
whom
our
hearts
are
bound
but
whose
affections
make
us
no
return
chapter
xxiii
the
curate
went
to
breakfast
next
morning
with
a
little
curiosity
and
a
great
deal
of
painful
feeling
he
had
been
inhospitable
to
his
brother
and
a
revulsion
had
happened
such
as
happens
invariably
when
a
generous
man
is
forced
by
external
circumstances
to
show
himself
churlish
though
his
good
sense
and
his
pride
alike
prevented
him
from
changing
his
resolution
of
the
previous
night
still
his
heart
had
relented
toward
jack
and
he
felt
sorry
and
half
ashamed
to
meet
the
brother
to
whom
he
had
shown
so
much
temper
and
so
little
kindness
it
was
much
later
than
usual
when
he
came
and
jack
was
just
coming
out
of
the
comfortable
chamber
which
belonged
of
right
to
his
brother
when
the
curate
entered
the
jack
was
in
his
as
on
the
previous
night
and
came
forth
humming
an
air
out
of
the
and
looking
as
wholesomely
fresh
and
clean
and
dainty
as
the
most
honest
gentleman
in
england
he
gave
his
brother
a
nod
and
wished
him
good
morning
i
am
glad
to
see
you
do
keep
distressingly
early
hours
he
said
between
the
bars
of
the
air
he
was
humming
he
was
a
man
of
perfect
digestion
like
all
the
wentworths
and
got
up
accordingly
in
a
good
temper
not
disposed
to
make
too
much
of
any
little
incivility
that
might
have
taken
place
on
the
contrary
he
helped
himself
to
his
brother
favourite
omelet
with
the
most
engaging
cheerfulness
and
entered
into
such
conversation
as
might
be
supposed
to
suit
a
perpetual
curate
in
a
little
country
town
i
daresay
you
have
a
good
many
nice
people
about
here
said
jack
i
done
nothing
but
walk
about
since
i
came
and
it
does
a
man
good
to
see
those
fresh
little
women
with
their
pink
cheeks
there
one
a
sister
of
our
friend
i
believe
he
continued
with
a
nod
towards
the
door
to
indicate
wodehouse
an
uncommonly
pretty
girl
i
can
tell
you
and
there
a
little
rosebud
of
a
creature
at
that
shop
whom
they
tell
me
you
interested
in
your
living
is
not
worth
much
i
suppose
it
unlucky
having
two
clergymen
in
a
family
but
to
be
sure
you
going
in
for
skelmersdale
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
how
are
the
aunts
i
have
not
heard
anything
of
them
for
ages
female
relations
of
that
description
generally
cling
to
the
parsons
of
the
race
i
suppose
they
are
all
living
all
three
some
people
never
seem
to
die
they
are
here
said
the
curate
succinctly
living
in
carlingford
i
wonder
nobody
has
told
you
a
sudden
bright
spark
lighted
in
the
prodigal
eyes
ah
they
are
here
are
they
he
said
after
a
momentary
pause
so
much
the
better
for
you
but
in
justice
you
ought
to
be
content
with
the
living
i
say
so
as
your
elder
brother
gerald
has
the
best
right
to
what
got
to
leave
by
the
by
how
are
gerald
and
the
rest
you
just
been
there
i
suppose
our
respected
parent
goes
on
multiplying
to
think
of
so
many
odious
little
wretches
calling
themselves
wentworth
is
enough
to
make
one
disgusted
with
the
name
my
father
was
very
ill
when
i
left
he
has
had
another
attack
said
the
curate
he
does
not
seem
able
to
bear
any
agitation
your
telegram
upset
him
altogether
i
do
know
what
you
been
about
he
did
not
tell
me
continued
the
younger
brother
with
a
little
emotion
but
he
is
very
uneasy
about
you
ah
i
daresay
said
jack
that
natural
but
he
wonderfully
tough
for
such
an
old
fellow
i
should
say
it
would
take
twenty
attacks
to
finish
him
and
this
is
the
second
is
it
i
wonder
how
long
an
interval
there
was
between
the
two
it
would
be
a
pretty
calculation
for
a
wodehouse
seems
to
have
brought
his
ancestor
down
at
the
first
shot
almost
but
then
there
no
entail
in
his
case
and
the
old
fellow
may
have
made
a
will
i
beg
your
pardon
you
do
like
this
sort
of
talk
i
forgot
you
were
a
clergyman
i
rather
like
this
town
of
yours
do
you
know
sweet
situation
and
good
for
the
health
i
should
say
i
take
your
advice
i
think
about
the
how
did
you
call
it
black
boar
unless
indeed
some
charitable
family
would
take
me
in
said
the
elder
brother
with
a
glance
from
under
his
eyelids
his
real
meaning
did
not
in
the
least
degree
suggest
itself
to
the
curate
who
was
thinking
more
of
what
was
past
than
of
what
was
to
come
you
seem
to
take
a
great
interest
in
wodehouse
said
mr
wentworth
yes
and
so
do
you
said
jack
with
a
keen
glance
of
curiosity
i
ca
tell
why
my
interest
in
him
is
easily
explained
if
the
affair
came
to
a
trial
it
might
involve
other
people
who
are
of
retiring
dispositions
and
dislike
publicity
i
do
mind
saying
continued
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
looking
across
at
his
brother
with
smiling
candour
that
i
might
myself
be
brought
before
the
world
in
a
way
which
would
wound
my
modesty
so
it
must
not
be
permitted
to
go
any
further
you
perceive
the
partner
has
got
a
warrant
out
but
has
not
put
it
into
execution
as
yet
that
why
i
sent
for
you
you
are
the
only
man
so
far
as
i
can
see
that
can
be
of
any
use
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
the
curate
hastily
nor
what
connection
you
can
possibly
have
with
wodehouse
perhaps
it
is
better
not
to
inquire
i
mean
to
do
my
best
for
him
independent
of
you
do
said
jack
wentworth
with
a
slight
yawn
it
is
much
better
not
to
inquire
a
clergyman
runs
the
risk
of
hearing
things
that
may
shock
him
when
he
enters
into
worldly
business
but
the
position
of
mediator
is
thoroughly
professional
now
for
the
black
boar
i
send
for
my
traps
when
i
get
settled
he
said
rising
in
his
languid
way
he
had
made
a
very
good
breakfast
and
he
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
make
himself
uncomfortable
by
quarrelling
with
his
brother
besides
he
had
a
new
idea
in
his
mind
so
he
gave
the
curate
another
little
nod
and
disappeared
into
the
from
which
he
emerged
a
few
minutes
after
with
a
coat
replacing
the
ready
to
go
out
i
daresay
i
shall
see
you
again
before
i
leave
carlingford
he
said
and
left
the
room
with
the
utmost
suavity
as
for
mr
wentworth
it
is
probable
that
his
brother
serenity
had
quite
the
reverse
of
a
soothing
effect
upon
his
mind
and
temper
he
rose
from
the
table
as
soon
as
jack
was
gone
and
for
a
long
time
paced
about
the
room
composing
himself
and
planning
what
he
was
to
do
so
long
indeed
that
sarah
after
coming
up
softly
to
inspect
had
cleared
the
table
and
put
everything
straight
in
the
room
before
the
curate
discovered
her
presence
it
was
only
when
she
came
up
to
him
at
last
with
her
little
rustical
curtsy
to
say
that
please
her
missis
would
like
to
see
him
for
a
moment
in
the
parlour
that
mr
wentworth
found
out
that
she
was
there
this
interruption
roused
him
out
of
his
manifold
and
complicated
thoughts
i
am
too
busy
just
now
but
i
will
see
mrs
hadwin
he
said
and
you
can
tell
her
that
my
brother
has
gone
to
get
rooms
at
the
blue
boar
after
he
had
thus
satisfied
the
sympathetic
handmaiden
the
curate
crossed
over
to
the
closed
door
of
wodehouse
room
and
knocked
the
inmate
there
was
still
in
bed
as
was
his
custom
and
answered
mr
wentworth
through
his
beard
in
a
recumbent
voice
less
sulky
and
more
uncertain
than
on
the
previous
night
poor
wodehouse
had
neither
the
nerve
nor
the
digestion
of
his
more
splendid
associate
he
had
no
strength
of
evil
in
himself
when
he
was
out
of
the
way
of
it
and
the
consequence
of
a
restless
night
was
a
natural
amount
of
penitence
and
shame
in
the
morning
he
met
the
curate
with
a
depressed
countenance
and
answered
all
his
questions
readily
enough
even
giving
him
the
particulars
of
the
forged
bills
in
respect
to
which
thomas
wodehouse
the
younger
could
not
somehow
feel
so
guilty
as
if
it
had
been
a
name
different
from
his
own
which
he
had
affixed
to
those
fatal
bits
of
paper
and
he
did
not
hesitate
much
to
promise
that
he
would
go
abroad
and
try
to
make
a
new
beginning
if
this
matter
could
be
settled
mr
wentworth
went
out
with
some
satisfaction
after
the
interview
believing
in
his
heart
that
his
own
remonstrances
had
had
their
due
effect
as
it
is
so
natural
to
believe
for
he
did
not
know
having
slept
very
soundly
that
it
had
rained
a
good
deal
during
the
night
and
that
mrs
hadwin
biggest
tub
for
the
old
lady
had
a
passion
for
was
immediately
under
poor
wodehouse
window
and
kept
him
awake
as
it
filled
and
ran
over
all
through
the
summer
darkness
the
recollection
of
jack
wentworth
even
in
his
hour
of
success
was
insufficient
to
fortify
the
simple
soul
of
his
humble
admirer
against
that
ominous
sound
of
the
unseen
rain
and
against
the
flashes
of
sudden
lightning
that
seemed
to
blaze
into
his
heart
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
his
father
in
those
midnight
hours
and
of
all
the
melancholy
array
of
lost
years
which
had
made
him
no
longer
a
gentleman
as
he
used
to
be
but
a
skulking
vagabond
in
his
native
place
and
his
penitence
lasted
till
after
he
had
had
his
breakfast
and
mr
wentworth
was
gone
then
perhaps
the
other
side
of
the
question
recurred
to
his
mind
and
he
began
to
think
that
if
his
father
died
there
might
be
no
need
for
his
banishment
but
mr
wentworth
knew
nothing
of
this
change
in
his
sentiments
as
he
went
quickly
up
grange
lane
wharfside
and
all
the
district
had
lain
neglected
for
three
long
days
as
the
curate
was
aware
and
he
had
promised
to
call
at
no
prickett
lane
and
to
look
after
the
little
orphan
children
whom
lucy
had
taken
charge
of
his
occupations
in
short
both
public
and
private
were
overpowering
and
he
could
not
tell
how
he
was
to
get
through
them
for
in
addition
to
everything
else
it
was
friday
and
there
was
a
litany
service
at
twelve
at
st
roque
so
the
young
priest
had
little
time
to
lose
as
he
hurried
up
once
again
to
mr
wodehouse
green
door
it
was
miss
wodehouse
who
came
to
meet
the
curate
as
soon
as
his
presence
was
known
in
the
house
miss
wodehouse
and
not
lucy
who
made
way
for
her
sister
to
pass
her
and
took
no
notice
of
mr
wentworth
name
the
elder
sister
entered
very
hurriedly
the
little
parlour
and
shut
the
door
fast
and
came
up
to
him
with
an
anxious
inquiring
face
she
told
him
her
father
was
just
the
same
in
faltering
tones
and
oh
mr
wentworth
has
anything
happened
she
exclaimed
with
endless
unspeakable
questions
in
her
eyes
it
was
so
hard
for
the
gentle
woman
to
keep
her
secret
the
very
sight
of
somebody
who
knew
it
was
a
relief
to
her
heart
i
want
you
to
give
me
full
authority
to
act
for
you
said
the
curate
i
must
go
to
mr
wodehouse
partner
and
discuss
the
whole
matter
here
miss
wodehouse
gave
a
little
cry
and
stopped
him
suddenly
oh
mr
wentworth
it
would
kill
papa
to
know
you
had
spoken
to
any
one
you
must
send
him
away
she
said
breathless
with
anxiety
and
terror
to
think
of
discussing
it
with
any
one
when
even
lucy
does
not
know
she
spoke
with
so
much
haste
and
fright
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
make
out
her
last
words
nevertheless
i
must
speak
to
mr
waters
said
the
curate
i
am
going
there
now
he
knows
all
about
it
already
and
has
a
warrant
for
apprehension
but
we
must
stop
that
i
will
undertake
that
it
shall
be
paid
and
you
must
give
me
full
authority
to
act
for
you
when
miss
wodehouse
met
the
steady
look
he
gave
her
she
veered
immediately
from
her
fright
at
the
thought
of
having
it
spoken
of
to
gratitude
to
him
who
was
thus
ready
to
take
her
burden
into
his
hands
oh
mr
wentworth
it
is
so
good
of
you
it
is
like
a
brother
said
the
trembling
woman
and
then
she
made
a
pause
i
say
a
brother
she
said
drawing
an
involuntary
moral
though
we
have
never
had
any
good
of
ours
and
oh
if
lucy
only
knew
the
curate
turned
away
hastily
and
wrung
her
hand
without
being
aware
of
it
no
he
said
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
do
let
her
know
i
do
want
to
appeal
to
her
gratitude
and
with
that
he
became
silent
and
fell
to
listening
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
if
perhaps
he
might
catch
any
sound
of
footsteps
coming
she
will
know
better
some
day
said
miss
wodehouse
wiping
her
eyes
and
oh
mr
wentworth
if
papa
ever
gets
better
here
the
poor
lady
broke
down
into
inarticulate
weeping
but
i
know
you
will
stand
by
us
she
said
amid
her
tears
it
is
all
the
comfort
i
have
and
lucy
there
was
no
sound
of
any
footstep
on
the
stair
nothing
but
the
ticking
of
the
timepiece
on
the
mantelshelf
and
the
rustling
of
the
curtains
in
the
soft
morning
breeze
which
came
through
the
open
window
and
miss
wodehouse
crying
the
curate
had
not
expected
to
see
lucy
and
knew
in
his
heart
that
it
was
better
they
should
not
meet
just
at
this
moment
but
notwithstanding
this
it
was
strange
how
bitter
and
disappointed
he
felt
and
what
an
impatient
longing
he
had
for
one
look
of
her
even
though
it
should
be
a
look
which
would
drive
him
frantic
with
mortified
love
and
disappointed
expectation
to
know
that
she
was
under
the
same
roof
and
that
she
knew
he
was
here
but
kept
away
and
did
not
care
to
see
him
was
gall
to
his
excited
mind
he
went
away
hastily
pressing
poor
miss
wodehouse
hand
with
a
kind
of
silent
rage
do
talk
about
lucy
he
said
half
to
himself
his
heart
swelling
and
throbbing
at
the
sound
of
the
name
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
it
aloud
to
any
ear
but
his
own
and
he
left
the
house
tingling
with
an
indignation
and
mortification
and
bitter
fondness
which
could
not
be
expressed
in
words
what
he
was
about
to
do
was
for
her
sake
and
he
thought
to
himself
with
a
forlorn
pride
that
she
would
never
know
it
and
it
did
not
matter
he
could
not
tell
that
lucy
was
glancing
out
furtively
over
the
blind
ashamed
of
herself
in
her
wounded
heart
for
doing
so
and
wondering
whether
even
now
he
was
occupied
with
that
unworthy
love
which
had
made
an
everlasting
separation
between
them
if
it
had
been
any
one
worthy
it
would
have
been
different
poor
lucy
thought
as
she
pressed
back
the
tears
into
her
eyes
and
looked
out
wistfully
at
him
over
the
blind
she
in
the
and
he
in
the
fresh
garden
hastening
out
to
his
work
were
both
thinking
in
their
hearts
how
perverse
life
was
and
how
hard
it
was
not
to
be
happy
as
indeed
they
well
might
in
a
general
way
though
perhaps
one
glance
of
the
curate
eyes
upward
one
meeting
of
looks
might
have
resulted
quite
reasonably
in
a
more
felicitous
train
of
thinking
at
least
for
that
day
chapter
xxiv
when
mr
wentworth
arrived
in
the
little
vestry
at
st
roque
to
robe
himself
for
the
approaching
service
it
was
after
a
long
and
tough
contest
with
mr
wodehouse
partner
which
had
to
a
great
extent
exhausted
his
energies
mr
wodehouse
was
the
leading
attorney
in
carlingford
the
chief
family
solicitor
in
the
county
a
man
looked
upon
with
favourable
eyes
even
by
the
great
people
as
being
himself
a
cadet
of
a
county
family
his
partner
mr
waters
was
altogether
a
different
description
of
man
he
was
much
more
clever
and
a
good
deal
more
like
a
gentleman
but
he
had
not
a
connection
in
the
world
and
had
fought
his
way
up
to
prosperity
through
many
a
narrow
and
perhaps
if
people
spoke
true
many
a
dirty
avenue
to
fortune
he
was
very
glad
of
the
chance
which
brought
his
partner
reputation
and
credit
thus
under
his
power
and
he
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
deal
gently
with
the
prodigal
son
that
is
to
say
he
was
quite
disinclined
to
let
the
family
out
of
his
clutches
easily
or
to
consent
to
be
silent
and
frustrate
the
ends
of
justice
for
anything
else
than
an
important
equivalent
mr
wentworth
had
much
ado
to
restrain
his
temper
while
the
wily
attorney
talked
about
his
conscience
for
the
curate
was
enough
to
perceive
at
the
first
glance
that
mr
waters
had
no
real
intention
of
proceeding
to
extremities
the
lawyer
would
not
pledge
himself
to
anything
notwithstanding
all
mr
wentworth
arguments
wodehouse
himself
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
law
should
take
its
course
he
said
but
out
of
respect
for
his
partner
he
might
wait
a
few
days
to
see
what
turn
his
illness
would
take
i
confess
that
i
am
not
adapted
for
my
profession
mr
wentworth
my
feelings
overcome
me
a
great
deal
too
often
said
the
sharp
man
of
business
looking
full
into
the
curate
eyes
and
while
the
father
is
dying
i
have
not
the
heart
to
proceed
against
the
son
but
i
pledge
myself
to
nothing
recollect
to
nothing
and
with
this
and
a
very
indignant
mind
mr
wentworth
had
been
forced
to
come
away
his
thoughts
were
occupied
with
the
contrarieties
of
the
world
as
he
hastened
along
to
st
roque
how
one
man
had
to
bear
another
burdens
in
every
station
and
capacity
of
life
and
how
another
man
triumphed
and
came
to
success
by
means
of
the
misfortunes
of
his
friends
it
was
hard
to
tell
what
made
the
difference
or
how
humankind
got
divided
into
these
two
great
classes
for
possibly
enough
the
sharp
attorney
was
as
just
in
his
way
as
the
curate
but
mr
wentworth
got
no
more
satisfaction
in
thinking
of
it
than
the
speculatists
generally
have
when
they
investigate
this
strange
wayward
fantastical
humanity
which
is
never
to
be
calculated
upon
he
came
into
the
little
vestry
of
st
roque
which
was
a
stony
little
room
with
a
groined
roof
and
windows
too
severely
english
in
their
character
to
admit
any
great
amount
of
light
with
a
sensation
of
fatigue
and
discouragement
very
natural
to
a
man
who
had
been
interfering
in
other
people
affairs
there
was
some
comfort
in
the
litany
which
he
was
just
going
to
say
but
not
much
comfort
in
any
of
the
human
individuals
who
would
come
into
mr
wentworth
mind
as
he
paused
in
the
midst
of
the
suffrage
for
sick
persons
and
for
those
who
had
erred
and
were
deceived
that
the
worshippers
might
whisper
into
god
ear
the
names
for
which
their
hearts
were
most
concerned
the
young
priest
sighed
heavily
as
he
put
on
his
surplice
pondering
all
the
obstinate
selfishness
and
strange
contradictions
of
men
and
it
was
only
when
he
heard
a
rather
loud
echo
to
his
breath
of
weariness
that
he
looked
up
and
saw
elsworthy
who
was
contemplating
him
with
a
very
curious
expression
of
face
the
clerk
started
a
little
on
being
discovered
and
began
to
look
over
all
the
choristers
books
and
set
them
in
readiness
though
indeed
there
were
no
choristers
on
fridays
but
only
the
ladies
who
chanted
the
responses
a
great
deal
more
sweetly
and
wore
no
surplices
thinking
of
that
it
occurred
to
mr
wentworth
how
much
he
would
miss
the
round
full
notes
which
always
betrayed
lucy
presence
to
him
even
when
he
did
not
see
her
and
he
forgot
elsworthy
and
sighed
again
without
thinking
of
any
comment
which
might
be
made
upon
the
sound
i
sorry
to
see
sir
as
you
aint
in
your
usual
good
spirits
said
that
observant
spectator
coming
closer
up
to
his
clergyman
elsworthy
eyes
were
full
of
meanings
which
mr
wentworth
could
not
and
had
no
wish
to
decipher
i
am
perfectly
well
thank
you
said
the
perpetual
curate
with
his
coldest
tone
he
had
become
suspicious
of
the
man
he
could
scarcely
tell
why
there
a
deal
of
people
in
church
this
morning
said
the
clerk
and
then
he
came
closer
still
and
spoke
in
a
kind
of
whisper
about
that
little
matter
as
we
was
speaking
of
mr
wentworth
that
all
straight
sir
and
there
aint
no
occasion
to
be
vexed
she
came
back
this
morning
said
elsworthy
under
his
breath
who
came
back
this
morning
asked
the
curate
with
a
little
surprise
his
thoughts
had
been
so
much
with
lucy
that
no
one
else
occurred
to
him
at
the
moment
and
even
while
he
asked
the
question
his
busy
fancy
began
to
wonder
where
she
could
have
been
and
what
motive
could
have
taken
her
away
i
could
mean
nobody
but
rosa
as
i
talked
to
you
about
last
night
said
elsworthy
she
come
back
sir
as
you
wished
and
i
heard
as
she
was
in
carlingford
last
night
just
afore
you
come
mr
wentworth
when
i
thought
as
she
was
far
enough
off
which
allow
sir
whoever
it
was
she
come
to
see
it
was
the
right
thing
nor
what
her
aunt
and
me
had
reason
to
expect
the
curate
of
st
roque
said
pshaw
carelessly
to
himself
he
was
not
at
all
interested
in
rosa
elsworthy
instead
of
making
any
answer
he
drew
on
the
scarlet
band
of
his
hood
and
marched
away
gravely
into
the
leaving
the
open
behind
him
for
the
clerk
to
follow
the
little
dangers
that
harassed
his
personal
footsteps
had
not
yet
awakened
so
much
as
an
anxiety
in
his
mind
things
much
more
serious
preoccupied
his
thoughts
he
opened
his
with
a
consciousness
of
the
good
of
it
which
comes
to
men
only
now
and
then
at
oxford
in
his
day
mr
wentworth
had
entertained
his
doubts
like
others
and
like
most
people
was
aware
that
there
were
a
great
many
things
in
heaven
and
earth
totally
unexplainable
by
any
philosophy
but
he
had
always
been
more
of
a
man
than
a
thinker
even
before
he
became
a
high
anglican
and
being
still
much
in
earnest
about
most
things
he
had
to
do
with
he
found
great
comfort
just
at
this
moment
amid
all
his
perplexities
in
the
litany
he
was
saying
he
was
so
absorbed
in
it
and
so
full
of
that
appeal
out
of
all
troubles
and
miseries
to
the
god
who
can
not
be
indifferent
to
his
creatures
that
he
was
almost
at
the
last
amen
before
he
distinguished
that
voice
which
of
all
voices
was
most
dear
to
him
the
heart
of
the
young
man
swelled
when
he
heard
it
with
a
mingled
thrill
of
sympathy
and
wounded
feeling
she
had
not
left
her
to
see
but
she
found
time
to
run
down
the
sunny
road
to
st
roque
to
pray
for
the
sick
and
the
poor
when
he
knelt
down
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
service
was
it
wrong
instead
of
more
abstract
supplications
that
the
young
priest
said
over
and
over
god
bless
her
in
an
outburst
of
pity
and
tenderness
and
he
did
not
try
to
overtake
her
on
the
road
as
he
might
have
done
had
his
heart
been
less
deeply
touched
but
went
off
with
abstracted
looks
to
wharfside
where
all
the
poor
people
were
very
glad
to
see
him
and
where
his
absence
was
spoken
of
as
if
he
had
been
three
months
instead
of
three
days
away
it
was
like
going
back
a
century
or
two
into
primitive
life
to
go
into
the
district
where
civilisation
did
not
prevail
to
any
very
distressing
extent
and
where
people
in
general
spoke
their
minds
freely
but
even
when
he
came
out
of
no
where
the
poor
woman
still
kept
on
living
mr
wentworth
was
made
aware
of
his
private
troubles
for
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
where
there
was
a
little
bit
of
vacant
ground
the
rector
was
standing
with
some
of
the
schismatics
of
wharfside
planning
how
to
place
the
iron
church
which
it
was
said
he
meant
to
establish
in
the
very
heart
of
the
district
mr
morgan
took
off
his
hat
very
stiffly
to
the
perpetual
curate
who
returned
up
prickett
lane
with
a
heightened
colour
and
quickened
pulse
a
man
must
be
an
angel
indeed
who
can
see
his
work
taken
out
of
his
hands
and
betray
no
human
emotion
mr
wentworth
went
into
elsworthy
as
he
went
back
to
write
a
forcible
little
note
to
the
rector
on
the
subject
before
he
returned
home
it
was
rosa
who
handed
him
the
paper
he
wanted
and
he
gave
her
a
little
nod
without
looking
at
her
but
when
he
had
closed
his
note
and
laid
it
on
the
counter
to
be
delivered
the
curate
found
her
still
standing
near
and
looked
at
the
little
blushing
creature
with
some
natural
admiration
so
you
have
come
back
he
said
but
mind
you
do
go
into
grange
lane
any
more
after
dark
little
rosa
when
he
had
left
the
shop
and
finished
this
little
matter
he
bethought
himself
of
his
aunts
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
he
returned
aunt
dora
was
not
at
her
usual
sentinel
window
when
he
crossed
grange
lane
towards
their
and
the
door
itself
was
open
and
some
one
from
the
blue
boar
was
carrying
in
a
large
portmanteau
mr
wentworth
curiosity
was
strangely
excited
by
the
sight
he
said
who
has
come
lewis
to
miss
wentworth
man
who
stood
in
the
hall
superintending
the
arrival
but
ran
without
waiting
for
any
answer
he
felt
by
instinct
that
the
visitor
was
some
one
likely
to
increase
the
confusion
of
affairs
and
perplex
matters
more
and
more
to
himself
but
even
this
presentiment
did
not
prepare
him
for
the
astonishing
sight
which
met
his
eyes
when
he
entered
the
there
the
three
ladies
were
all
assembled
regarding
with
different
developments
of
interest
the
who
had
thrown
himself
on
a
sofa
aunt
dora
was
sitting
by
him
with
a
bottle
of
in
her
hand
for
this
meeting
had
evidently
gone
to
the
heart
of
the
returned
prodigal
aunt
dora
was
ready
to
have
sacrificed
all
the
veal
in
the
country
in
honour
of
jack
repentance
and
the
curate
stood
outside
upon
the
threshold
looking
at
the
scene
with
the
strangest
realisation
of
the
state
of
mind
of
the
elder
brother
in
the
parable
he
had
himself
been
rather
found
fault
with
excused
and
tolerated
among
his
relations
but
jack
had
at
once
become
master
of
the
position
and
taken
possession
of
all
their
sympathies
mr
wentworth
stood
gazing
at
them
and
yet
more
angry
than
amused
feeling
with
a
little
indignation
as
was
natural
that
the
pretended
penitence
of
the
clever
sinner
was
far
more
effective
and
interesting
than
his
own
spotless
loyalty
and
truth
to
be
sure
they
were
only
three
old
ladies
three
old
aunts
and
he
smiled
at
the
sight
but
though
he
smiled
he
did
not
like
it
and
perhaps
was
more
abrupt
than
usual
in
his
salutations
miss
leonora
was
seated
at
her
busy
with
her
correspondence
the
question
of
the
new
was
not
yet
decided
and
she
had
been
in
the
middle
of
a
letter
of
encouragement
to
her
agents
on
the
subject
reminding
them
that
even
though
the
licence
was
granted
the
world
would
still
go
on
all
the
same
and
that
the
worst
possibilities
must
be
encountered
when
jack
the
prodigal
made
his
appearance
with
all
the
tokens
of
reformation
and
repentance
about
him
to
throw
himself
upon
the
christian
charity
of
his
relations
a
penitent
sinner
was
too
tempting
a
bait
for
even
miss
leonora
good
sense
to
withstand
and
she
had
postponed
her
to
hear
his
explanations
but
jack
had
told
his
story
by
this
time
and
had
explained
how
much
he
wanted
to
withdraw
out
of
the
world
in
which
he
had
been
led
astray
and
how
sick
he
was
of
all
its
whirl
of
temptations
and
disappointment
and
miss
leonora
had
returned
to
her
letter
when
her
younger
nephew
arrived
as
for
miss
wentworth
she
was
seated
placidly
in
her
usual
smiling
with
equable
smiles
upon
both
the
young
men
and
lifting
her
beautiful
old
cheek
for
frank
to
kiss
just
as
she
had
lifted
it
to
jack
it
was
miss
dora
who
was
most
shaken
out
of
her
allegiance
she
who
had
always
made
frank
her
special
charge
though
she
had
wept
herself
into
a
day
headache
on
his
behalf
so
short
a
time
ago
aunt
dora
for
a
moment
had
allowed
the
more
effusive
prodigal
to
supersede
frank
instead
of
taking
him
into
her
arms
as
usual
and
clinging
to
him
she
only
put
the
hand
that
held
the
over
his
shoulder
as
she
kissed
him
jack
who
had
been
so
dreadfully
inexpressibly
wicked
and
who
had
come
back
to
his
aunts
to
be
converted
and
restored
to
his
right
mind
was
more
interesting
than
many
curates
she
sat
down
again
by
her
penitent
as
soon
as
she
had
saluted
his
brother
and
even
miss
leonora
when
she
paused
in
her
letter
turned
her
eyes
towards
jack
so
gerald
is
actually
going
over
to
rome
said
the
aunt
i
never
expected
anything
else
i
had
a
letter
from
louisa
yesterday
asking
me
to
use
my
influence
as
if
i
had
any
influence
over
your
brother
if
a
silly
wife
was
any
justification
for
a
man
making
an
idiot
of
himself
gerald
might
be
excused
but
i
suppose
the
next
thing
we
shall
hear
of
will
be
that
you
have
followed
him
frank
did
you
hear
anything
further
about
janet
and
that
lover
of
hers
in
a
large
family
like
ours
there
is
always
something
troublesome
going
on
said
miss
leonora
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
of
your
attack
father
had
a
great
many
attacks
and
lived
to
eighty
but
he
had
few
difficulties
with
the
female
part
of
his
household
she
continued
with
a
grim
little
smile
for
miss
leonora
rather
piqued
herself
upon
her
exemption
from
any
known
sentimental
episode
even
in
her
youth
dear
jack
return
will
make
up
for
a
great
deal
said
aunt
dora
oh
frank
my
dear
your
brother
has
made
us
all
so
happy
he
has
just
been
telling
us
that
he
means
to
give
up
all
his
racing
and
betting
and
wickedness
and
when
he
has
been
with
us
a
little
and
learned
to
appreciate
a
domestic
circle
said
poor
miss
dora
putting
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
she
was
so
much
overcome
that
she
could
not
finish
the
sentence
but
she
put
her
disengaged
hand
upon
jack
arm
and
patted
it
and
in
her
heart
concluded
that
as
soon
as
the
blanket
was
done
for
louisa
bassinet
she
would
work
him
a
pair
of
slippers
which
should
endear
more
and
more
to
him
the
domestic
circle
and
stimulate
the
virtue
in
his
repentant
heart
i
do
know
what
jack
return
may
do
said
mr
wentworth
but
i
hope
you
do
imagine
it
was
gerald
who
caused
my
father
illness
know
better
at
least
said
the
indignant
curate
looking
at
the
hero
on
the
sofa
that
interesting
reprobate
lifted
his
eyes
with
a
covert
gleam
of
humour
to
the
unresponsive
countenance
of
his
brother
and
then
he
stroked
his
silky
beard
and
sighed
my
dear
aunt
frank
is
right
said
jack
with
a
melancholy
voice
i
have
not
concealed
from
you
that
my
father
has
great
reason
to
be
offended
with
me
i
have
done
very
much
the
reverse
of
what
i
ought
to
have
done
i
see
even
frank
ca
forgive
me
and
i
do
wonder
at
it
said
the
prodigal
though
i
have
done
him
no
harm
that
i
know
of
and
again
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
sighed
and
covered
his
face
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
oh
frank
cried
miss
dora
with
streaming
eyes
oh
my
dear
boy
is
there
joy
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
not
going
to
be
the
wicked
elder
brother
that
grudged
the
prodigal
his
welcome
you
not
going
to
give
way
to
jealousy
frank
hold
your
tongue
dora
said
the
sister
i
daresay
frank
knows
a
great
deal
better
than
you
do
but
i
want
to
know
about
gerald
and
what
is
to
be
done
if
he
goes
to
rome
of
course
you
will
take
wentworth
rectory
so
it
will
not
be
an
unmingled
evil
said
miss
leonora
biting
her
pen
and
throwing
a
keen
glance
at
the
curate
of
st
roque
especially
as
you
and
we
differ
so
entirely
in
our
views
i
could
not
consent
to
appoint
anybody
to
skelmersdale
even
if
poor
mr
shirley
were
to
die
who
did
not
preach
the
gospel
and
it
would
be
sad
for
you
to
spend
all
your
life
in
a
perpetual
curacy
where
you
could
have
no
income
nor
ever
hope
to
be
able
to
marry
she
continued
steadily
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
nephew
of
course
if
you
had
entered
the
church
for
the
love
of
the
work
it
would
be
a
different
matter
said
the
aunt
but
that
sort
of
thing
seems
to
have
gone
out
of
fashion
i
am
sorry
about
gerald
very
sorry
but
after
what
i
saw
of
him
i
am
not
surprised
and
it
is
a
comfort
to
one
mind
to
think
that
you
will
be
provided
for
frank
miss
leonora
wrote
a
few
words
of
the
letter
as
she
finished
this
speech
what
she
was
saying
in
that
epistle
was
in
reference
to
the
that
all
discouragements
were
sent
by
god
and
that
no
doubt
his
meaning
was
that
we
should
work
all
the
harder
to
make
way
against
them
after
putting
down
which
encouraging
sentiment
she
raised
her
eyes
again
and
planted
her
spear
in
her
nephew
bosom
with
the
greatest
composure
in
the
world
my
perpetual
curacy
suits
me
very
well
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
little
pride
and
there
is
a
good
deal
to
do
in
carlingford
however
i
did
not
come
here
to
talk
about
that
the
rector
is
going
to
put
up
an
iron
church
in
my
district
said
the
young
man
who
was
rather
glad
of
a
subject
which
permitted
a
little
of
his
indignation
to
escape
it
is
very
easy
to
interfere
with
other
people
work
and
then
he
paused
not
choosing
to
grumble
to
an
unsympathetic
audience
to
feel
that
nobody
cares
about
your
feelings
is
better
than
all
the
rules
of
the
perpetual
curate
stopped
instinctively
with
a
dignified
restraint
which
would
have
been
impossible
to
him
under
other
circumstances
it
was
no
merit
of
his
but
he
reaped
the
advantage
of
it
all
the
same
but
oh
my
dear
said
miss
dora
what
a
comfort
to
think
of
what
st
paul
says
it
be
for
the
right
motive
or
not
christ
is
still
preached
and
one
never
knows
what
chance
word
may
touch
a
heart
said
the
poor
little
woman
shaking
her
limp
curls
away
from
her
cheeks
it
was
you
being
offended
with
him
that
made
dear
jack
think
of
coming
to
us
and
what
a
happiness
it
is
to
think
that
he
sees
the
error
of
his
ways
cried
poor
miss
dora
drying
her
tears
and
oh
frank
my
dear
boy
i
trust
you
will
take
warning
by
your
brother
and
not
run
into
temptation
continued
the
anxious
aunt
remembering
all
her
troubles
if
you
were
to
go
wrong
it
would
take
away
all
the
pleasure
of
life
that
is
just
what
i
was
thinking
said
aunt
cecilia
from
her
for
oh
frank
my
dear
said
miss
dora
much
emboldened
by
this
support
you
must
consider
that
you
are
a
clergyman
and
there
are
a
great
many
things
that
are
wrong
in
a
clergyman
that
would
not
matter
in
another
man
oh
leonora
if
you
would
speak
to
him
he
would
mind
you
cried
the
poor
lady
for
you
know
a
clergyman
is
quite
different
and
miss
dora
again
stopped
short
and
the
three
aunts
looked
at
the
bewildered
curate
who
for
his
part
sat
gazing
at
them
without
an
idea
what
they
could
mean
what
have
i
been
doing
that
would
be
right
in
another
man
he
said
with
a
smile
which
was
slightly
forced
and
then
he
turned
to
jack
who
was
laughing
softly
under
his
breath
and
stroking
his
silky
beard
the
elder
brother
was
highly
amused
by
the
situation
altogether
but
frank
as
was
natural
did
not
see
it
in
the
same
light
what
have
you
been
saying
said
the
indignant
curate
and
his
eyes
gave
forth
a
sudden
light
which
frightened
miss
dora
and
brought
her
in
to
the
rescue
oh
frank
he
has
not
been
saying
anything
cried
that
troubled
woman
it
is
only
what
we
have
heard
everywhere
oh
my
dear
boy
it
is
only
for
your
good
i
ever
thought
of
speaking
there
is
nobody
in
the
world
to
whom
your
welfare
is
so
precious
said
poor
miss
dora
oh
frank
if
you
and
your
brother
were
to
have
any
difference
i
should
think
it
all
my
fault
and
i
always
said
you
did
not
mean
anything
she
said
putting
herself
and
her
between
the
two
and
looking
as
if
she
were
about
to
throw
herself
into
the
curate
arms
oh
frank
dear
do
blame
any
one
else
it
is
my
fault
cried
aunt
dora
with
tears
and
the
foolish
creature
kept
between
them
ready
to
rush
in
if
any
conflict
should
occur
which
was
a
supposition
much
resented
by
the
curate
of
st
roque
jack
and
i
have
no
intention
of
fighting
i
daresay
he
said
drawing
his
chair
away
with
some
impatience
and
jack
lay
back
on
the
sofa
and
stroked
his
beard
and
looked
on
with
the
greatest
composure
while
poor
miss
dora
exhausted
her
alarm
it
is
all
my
fault
sobbed
aunt
dora
but
oh
my
dear
boy
it
was
only
for
your
good
and
i
always
said
you
did
not
mean
anything
said
the
discomfited
peacemaker
all
this
though
it
was
highly
amusing
to
the
prodigal
was
gall
and
bitterness
to
the
perpetual
curate
it
moved
him
far
more
deeply
than
he
could
have
imagined
it
possible
for
anything
spoken
by
his
aunt
dora
to
move
him
perhaps
there
is
something
in
human
nature
which
demands
to
be
comprehended
even
where
it
is
aware
that
comprehension
is
impossible
and
it
wounded
him
in
the
most
unreasonable
way
to
have
it
supposed
that
he
was
likely
to
get
into
any
quarrel
with
his
brother
and
to
see
jack
thus
preferred
to
himself
do
be
a
fool
said
miss
leonora
sharply
i
wish
you
would
confine
yourself
to
louisa
bassinet
and
talk
of
things
you
can
understand
i
hope
frank
knows
what
he
is
doing
better
than
a
set
of
old
women
at
the
same
time
frank
said
miss
leonora
rising
and
leading
the
way
to
the
door
i
want
to
say
a
word
to
you
think
you
are
above
misconception
most
people
believe
a
lie
more
readily
than
the
truth
dora
is
a
fool
said
the
elder
sister
pausing
when
she
had
led
her
nephew
outside
the
door
but
so
are
most
people
and
i
advise
you
to
be
careful
and
not
to
give
occasion
for
any
gossip
otherwise
i
do
say
disapprove
of
your
conduct
she
had
her
pen
in
one
hand
and
held
out
the
other
to
him
dismissing
him
and
even
this
added
to
the
painful
feeling
in
the
curate
heart
i
should
hope
not
he
said
somewhat
stiffly
my
conduct
is
not
likely
to
be
affected
by
any
gossip
and
i
do
see
any
need
for
taking
precautions
against
imaginary
danger
miss
leonora
thought
her
nephew
looked
very
ungracious
as
he
went
away
she
said
to
herself
that
frank
had
a
great
deal
of
temper
and
resembled
his
mother
family
more
than
the
wentworths
as
she
went
back
to
her
and
though
she
could
not
disapprove
of
him
she
felt
vexed
somehow
at
his
rectitude
and
his
impatience
of
advice
whereas
jack
poor
fellow
who
had
been
a
great
sinner
was
according
to
all
appearance
a
great
penitent
also
and
a
true
wentworth
with
all
the
family
features
such
were
miss
leonora
thoughts
as
she
went
back
to
finish
her
letters
and
to
encourage
her
agents
in
her
london
district
to
carry
on
the
good
work
god
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
his
wonders
to
perform
she
wrote
apropos
of
the
and
set
very
distinctly
before
her
spiritual
retainers
all
that
providence
might
intend
by
this
unexpected
hindrance
and
so
quite
contented
herself
about
her
nephew
whose
views
on
this
and
many
other
subjects
were
so
different
from
her
own
meanwhile
mr
wentworth
went
about
the
rest
of
the
day
work
in
a
not
unusual
but
far
from
pleasant
frame
of
mind
when
one
suddenly
feels
that
the
sympathy
upon
which
one
calculated
most
surely
has
been
withdrawn
the
shock
is
naturally
considerable
it
might
not
be
anything
very
great
while
it
lasted
but
still
one
feels
the
difference
when
it
is
taken
away
lucy
had
fallen
off
from
him
and
even
aunt
dora
had
ceased
to
feel
his
concerns
the
first
in
the
world
he
smiled
at
himself
for
the
wound
he
felt
but
that
did
not
remove
the
sting
of
it
after
the
occupations
of
the
day
were
over
when
at
last
he
was
going
home
and
when
his
work
and
the
sense
of
fatigue
which
accompanied
it
had
dulled
his
mind
a
little
the
curate
felt
himself
still
dwelling
on
the
same
matter
contemplating
it
in
a
point
of
view
as
proud
men
are
not
unapt
to
contemplate
anything
that
mortifies
them
he
began
to
realise
in
a
humorous
way
his
own
sensations
as
he
stood
at
the
door
and
recognised
the
prodigal
on
the
sofa
and
then
a
smile
dawned
upon
his
lip
as
he
thought
once
more
of
the
prodigal
elder
brother
who
regarded
that
business
with
unsympathetic
eyes
and
grudged
the
supper
and
from
that
he
went
into
a
line
of
thought
and
imagined
to
himself
half
smiling
how
if
he
had
been
dr
cumming
or
the
minister
of
salem
chapel
he
might
have
written
a
series
of
sermons
on
the
unappreciated
characters
of
scripture
beginning
with
that
virtuous
uninteresting
elder
brother
from
which
suggestion
though
he
was
not
the
minister
of
salem
nor
dr
cumming
it
occurred
to
the
perpetual
curate
to
follow
out
the
idea
and
to
think
of
such
generous
careless
souls
as
esau
and
such
noble
unfortunates
as
the
the
mournful
magnificent
saul
people
not
generally
approved
of
or
enrolled
among
the
martyrs
or
saints
he
was
pursuing
this
kind
of
when
he
reached
his
own
house
it
was
again
late
and
dark
for
he
had
dined
in
the
mean
time
and
was
going
home
now
to
write
his
sermon
in
which
no
doubt
some
of
these
very
ideas
were
destined
to
reappear
he
opened
the
with
his
and
paused
with
an
involuntary
sense
of
the
beauty
and
freshness
of
the
night
as
soon
as
he
got
within
the
sheltering
walls
the
stars
were
shining
faint
and
sweet
in
the
summer
blue
and
all
the
shrubs
and
the
grass
breathing
forth
that
subdued
breath
of
fragrance
and
conscious
invisible
life
which
gives
so
much
sweetness
to
the
night
he
thought
he
heard
whispering
voices
as
he
paused
glancing
up
at
the
sky
and
then
from
the
he
saw
a
little
figure
run
and
heard
a
light
little
footstep
fluttering
towards
the
door
which
he
had
just
closed
mr
wentworth
started
and
went
after
this
little
flying
figure
with
some
anxiety
two
or
three
of
his
long
strides
brought
him
up
with
the
escaping
visitor
as
she
fumbled
in
her
agitation
over
the
handle
of
the
door
you
have
come
again
notwithstanding
what
i
said
to
you
but
you
must
not
repeat
it
rosa
said
the
curate
no
good
can
come
of
these
meetings
i
will
tell
your
uncle
if
i
ever
find
you
here
again
oh
no
no
please
do
cried
the
girl
but
after
all
i
mind
she
said
with
more
confidence
he
would
think
it
was
something
very
different
and
rosa
raised
her
eyes
to
the
face
with
a
coquettish
inquiry
she
could
not
divest
herself
of
the
thought
that
mr
wentworth
was
jealous
and
did
not
like
to
have
her
come
there
for
anybody
but
himself
if
you
were
not
such
a
child
i
should
be
very
angry
said
the
curate
as
it
is
i
very
angry
with
the
person
who
deludes
you
into
coming
go
home
child
he
said
opening
the
door
to
her
and
remember
i
will
not
allow
you
on
any
pretext
to
come
here
again
his
words
were
low
and
perhaps
rosa
did
not
care
much
to
listen
but
there
was
quite
light
enough
to
show
them
both
very
plainly
as
he
stood
at
the
door
and
she
went
out
just
then
the
miss
hemmings
were
going
up
grange
lane
from
a
little
with
their
favourite
maid
and
all
their
eyes
about
them
they
looked
very
full
in
mr
wentworth
face
and
said
how
d
do
as
they
passed
the
door
and
when
they
had
passed
it
they
looked
at
each
other
with
eyes
which
spoke
volumes
mr
wentworth
shut
the
door
violently
with
irrepressible
vexation
and
annoyance
when
he
encountered
that
glance
he
made
no
farewells
nor
did
he
think
of
taking
care
of
rosa
on
the
way
home
as
he
had
done
before
he
was
intensely
annoyed
and
vexed
he
could
not
tell
how
and
this
was
how
it
happened
that
the
last
time
she
was
seen
in
carlingford
rosa
elsworthy
was
left
standing
by
herself
in
the
dark
at
mr
wentworth
door
chapter
xxv
the
curate
got
up
very
early
next
morning
he
had
his
sermon
to
write
and
it
was
saturday
and
all
the
events
of
the
week
had
naturally
enough
unsettled
his
mind
and
indisposed
him
for
when
the
events
of
life
come
fast
upon
a
man
it
is
seldom
that
he
finds
much
pleasure
in
abstract
literary
composition
and
the
style
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
was
not
of
that
hortatory
and
impassioned
character
which
sometimes
gives
as
much
relief
to
the
speaker
as
excitement
to
the
audience
so
he
got
up
in
the
early
sweetness
of
the
summer
morning
when
nobody
but
himself
was
astir
in
the
house
with
the
sense
of
entering
upon
a
task
and
taking
up
work
which
was
far
from
agreeable
to
him
when
he
came
into
the
little
room
which
he
used
as
a
study
and
threw
the
window
open
and
breathed
the
delicious
air
of
the
morning
which
was
all
thrilling
and
trembling
with
the
songs
of
birds
mr
wentworth
thoughts
were
far
from
being
concentrated
upon
any
one
subject
he
sat
down
at
his
and
arranged
his
pens
and
paper
and
wrote
down
the
text
he
had
selected
and
when
he
had
done
so
much
and
could
feel
that
he
had
made
a
beginning
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
poised
the
idle
pen
on
his
finger
and
abandoned
himself
to
his
thoughts
he
had
so
much
to
think
about
there
was
wodehouse
under
the
same
roof
with
whom
he
had
felt
himself
constrained
to
remonstrate
very
sharply
on
the
previous
night
there
was
jack
so
near
and
certainly
come
to
carlingford
on
no
good
errand
there
was
gerald
in
his
great
perplexity
and
distress
and
the
household
at
home
in
their
anxiety
and
last
but
worst
of
all
his
fancy
would
go
fluttering
about
the
doors
of
the
sick
chamber
in
grange
lane
longing
and
wondering
he
asked
himself
what
it
could
be
which
had
raised
that
impalpable
wall
between
lucy
and
himself
that
barrier
too
strong
to
be
overthrown
too
ethereal
to
be
complained
of
and
wondered
over
and
over
again
what
her
thoughts
were
towards
him
whether
she
thought
of
him
at
all
whether
she
was
offended
or
simply
indifferent
a
question
which
any
one
else
who
had
observed
lucy
as
closely
could
have
solved
without
any
difficulty
but
which
to
the
modest
and
true
love
of
the
perpetual
curate
was
at
present
the
grand
doubt
of
all
the
doubts
in
the
universe
with
this
matter
to
settle
and
with
the
consciousness
that
it
was
still
only
five
and
that
he
was
at
least
one
hour
beforehand
with
the
world
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
mr
wentworth
mused
and
loitered
over
his
work
and
how
when
it
was
nearly
six
and
sarah
and
the
cook
were
beginning
to
stir
from
their
sleep
there
still
remained
only
the
text
written
upon
the
which
was
so
nicely
arranged
before
him
on
the
table
when
the
wicked
man
turneth
away
from
the
evil
of
his
ways
and
doeth
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
this
was
the
text
but
sitting
at
the
open
window
looking
out
into
the
garden
where
the
birds
exempt
as
they
seemed
to
think
for
once
from
the
vulgar
scrutiny
of
man
were
singing
at
the
pitch
of
all
their
voices
as
they
prepared
for
breakfast
and
where
the
sweet
air
of
the
morning
breathed
into
his
mind
a
freshness
and
hopefulness
which
youth
can
never
resist
and
seduced
his
thoughts
away
from
all
the
harder
problems
of
his
life
to
dwell
upon
the
sweeter
trouble
of
that
doubt
about
lucy
was
not
the
best
means
of
getting
on
with
his
work
he
sat
thus
leaning
back
sometimes
dipping
his
pen
in
the
ink
and
hovering
over
the
paper
for
two
or
three
seconds
at
a
time
sometimes
reading
over
the
words
and
making
a
faint
effort
to
recall
his
own
attention
to
them
for
on
the
whole
perhaps
it
is
not
of
much
use
getting
up
very
early
in
the
morning
when
the
chief
consequence
of
it
is
that
a
man
feels
he
has
an
hour
to
spare
and
a
little
time
to
play
before
he
begins
mr
wentworth
was
still
lingering
in
this
peaceful
pause
when
he
heard
in
the
stillness
hasty
steps
coming
down
grange
lane
no
doubt
it
was
some
workmen
going
to
their
work
and
he
felt
it
must
be
nearly
six
and
dipped
his
pen
once
more
in
the
ink
but
the
next
moment
paused
again
to
listen
feeling
in
his
heart
a
strange
conviction
that
the
steps
would
stop
at
his
door
and
that
something
was
going
to
happen
he
was
sure
of
it
and
yet
somehow
the
sound
tingled
upon
his
heart
when
he
heard
the
bell
ring
waking
up
echoes
in
the
silent
house
cook
and
sarah
had
not
yet
given
any
signs
of
coming
and
nobody
stirred
even
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
mr
wentworth
put
down
his
pen
altogether
and
listened
with
an
anxiety
which
he
could
scarcely
account
for
knowing
as
he
said
to
himself
that
it
must
be
the
milk
or
the
baker
or
somebody
but
neither
the
milk
nor
the
baker
would
have
dared
to
knock
and
shake
and
kick
the
door
as
the
new
arrivals
were
doing
mr
wentworth
sat
still
as
long
as
he
could
then
he
added
to
the
din
they
were
making
outside
by
an
indignant
ring
of
his
own
bell
and
finally
getting
anxious
as
was
natural
and
bethinking
himself
of
his
father
attack
and
mr
wodehouse
illness
the
curate
took
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
and
hastened
to
open
the
door
mrs
hadwin
called
to
him
as
he
passed
her
room
thinking
it
was
sarah
and
begging
for
goodness
gracious
sake
to
know
directly
what
was
the
matter
and
he
felt
himself
growing
agitated
as
he
drew
back
the
complicated
bolts
and
turned
the
key
in
the
door
which
was
elaborately
defenced
as
was
natural
when
he
hurried
out
into
the
garden
the
songs
of
the
birds
and
the
morning
air
seemed
to
have
changed
their
character
he
thought
he
was
about
to
be
summoned
to
the
deathbed
of
one
or
other
of
the
old
men
upon
whom
their
sons
had
brought
such
misery
he
was
but
little
acquainted
with
the
fastenings
of
the
and
fumbled
a
little
over
them
in
his
anxiety
wait
a
moment
and
you
shall
be
admitted
he
called
out
to
those
outside
who
still
continued
to
knock
and
he
fancied
even
in
the
haste
and
confusion
of
the
moment
that
his
voice
caused
some
little
commotion
among
them
mr
wentworth
opened
the
door
looking
anxiously
out
for
some
boy
with
a
telegram
or
other
such
mournful
messenger
but
to
his
utter
amazement
was
nearly
knocked
down
by
the
sudden
plunge
of
elsworthy
who
entered
with
a
spring
like
that
of
a
wild
animal
and
whose
face
looked
white
and
haggard
as
he
rushed
in
he
came
against
the
curate
so
roughly
as
to
drive
him
a
step
or
two
farther
into
the
garden
and
naturally
aroused
somewhat
sharply
the
temper
of
the
young
man
who
had
already
begun
to
regard
him
with
disagreeable
sensations
as
a
kind
of
spy
against
himself
what
in
the
world
do
you
want
at
such
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
cried
mr
wentworth
and
what
do
you
mean
by
making
such
a
noise
is
mr
wodehouse
worse
or
what
has
happened
for
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
a
little
relieved
to
find
that
the
two
people
outside
both
belonged
to
carlingford
and
that
nowhere
was
there
any
visible
apparition
of
a
telegraph
boy
do
trifle
with
me
mr
wentworth
said
elsworthy
i
a
poor
man
but
a
worm
as
is
trodden
on
turns
i
want
my
child
sir
give
me
my
child
i
find
her
out
if
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
world
i
only
brought
down
my
neighbour
with
me
as
i
can
trust
he
continued
hoarsely
to
save
both
your
characters
i
do
want
to
make
no
talk
if
you
do
what
is
right
by
rosa
neither
me
or
him
will
ever
say
a
word
i
want
rosa
mr
wentworth
where
rosa
if
i
had
known
as
it
was
for
this
you
wanted
her
home
but
i
take
my
oath
not
to
make
no
talk
cried
the
clerk
with
passion
and
earnestness
which
confounded
mr
wentworth
if
you
promise
to
do
what
right
by
her
and
let
me
take
her
home
elsworthy
are
you
mad
cried
the
curate
is
he
out
of
his
senses
has
anything
happened
to
rosa
for
heaven
sake
hayles
do
stand
there
like
a
man
of
wood
but
tell
me
if
the
man
crazy
or
what
he
means
i
come
in
sir
if
you
no
objection
and
shut
the
door
not
to
make
a
talk
said
elsworthy
companion
peter
hayles
the
druggist
if
it
can
be
managed
without
any
gossip
it
be
best
for
all
parties
said
this
worthy
shutting
the
door
softly
after
him
the
thing
is
where
rosa
mr
wentworth
i
ca
think
as
you
got
her
here
she
all
the
same
as
my
own
child
cried
elsworthy
who
was
greatly
excited
i
had
her
and
loved
her
since
she
was
a
baby
i
mean
to
say
as
i
put
myself
forward
to
hurt
her
prospects
if
she
was
married
in
a
superior
line
o
life
but
them
as
harms
rosa
has
me
to
reckon
with
he
said
with
a
kind
of
fury
which
sat
strangely
on
the
man
mr
wentworth
where
the
child
god
forgive
you
both
given
me
a
night
o
weeping
but
if
you
do
what
right
by
rosa
and
send
her
home
in
the
mean
time
be
silent
sir
cried
the
curate
i
know
nothing
in
the
world
about
rosa
how
dare
you
venture
to
come
on
such
an
errand
to
me
i
understand
how
it
is
said
the
young
man
growing
red
and
angry
that
you
try
so
persistently
to
connect
this
child
with
me
i
have
never
had
anything
to
do
with
her
and
i
will
not
submit
to
any
such
impertinent
suspicion
leave
my
house
sir
immediately
and
insult
me
by
making
such
inquiries
here
mr
wentworth
was
very
angry
in
the
first
flush
of
his
wrath
he
did
not
think
what
misery
was
involved
in
the
question
which
had
been
addressed
to
him
nor
did
he
see
for
the
moment
the
terrible
calamity
to
rosa
which
was
suggested
by
this
search
for
her
he
thought
only
of
himself
as
was
natural
at
the
first
shock
of
the
injurious
and
insulting
suspicion
with
which
he
seemed
to
be
pursued
and
of
the
annoyance
which
she
and
her
friends
were
causing
him
what
do
you
mean
by
rousing
a
whole
household
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
cried
mr
wentworth
as
he
saw
with
vexation
sarah
very
startled
and
sleepy
come
stealing
round
by
the
kitchen
door
you
do
look
as
if
you
had
wanted
any
rousing
said
elsworthy
who
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
own
the
curate
authority
she
was
seen
at
your
door
the
last
thing
last
night
and
you
in
your
clothes
as
bright
as
day
and
for
us
afore
six
in
the
morning
do
you
think
as
i
shut
my
eyes
because
it
my
clergyman
cried
the
injured
man
passionately
i
want
my
little
girl
my
little
rosa
as
is
flesh
of
my
flesh
and
bone
of
my
bone
if
mr
wentworth
did
know
nothing
about
it
as
he
says
cried
elsworthy
with
sudden
insight
he
has
a
feelin
heart
and
he
be
grieved
about
the
child
but
he
aint
grieved
nor
concerned
nor
nothing
in
the
world
but
angry
and
will
you
tell
me
there
aint
nothing
to
be
drawn
from
that
but
it
far
from
my
intention
to
raise
a
talk
said
the
clerk
drawing
closer
and
touching
the
arm
of
the
perpetual
curate
let
her
come
back
and
if
you
a
man
of
your
word
and
behave
honourable
by
her
there
sha
be
nothing
said
in
carlingford
i
stand
up
for
you
sir
against
the
world
mr
wentworth
shook
off
his
assailant
hand
with
a
mingled
sense
of
exasperation
and
sympathy
i
tell
you
upon
my
honour
i
know
nothing
about
her
he
said
but
it
is
true
enough
i
have
been
thinking
only
of
myself
he
continued
addressing
the
other
how
about
the
girl
when
was
she
lost
and
ca
you
think
of
any
place
she
can
have
gone
to
elsworthy
hear
reason
cried
the
curate
anxiously
i
assure
you
on
my
word
that
i
have
never
seen
her
since
i
closed
this
upon
her
last
night
and
i
would
ask
you
sir
what
had
rosa
to
do
at
your
cried
the
clerk
of
st
roque
he
aint
denying
it
hayles
you
can
see
as
he
aint
of
it
what
was
it
as
she
came
here
for
but
you
mr
wentworth
i
always
had
a
great
respect
for
you
said
elsworthy
i
respected
you
as
my
clergyman
sir
as
well
as
for
other
things
but
you
a
young
man
and
human
nature
is
frail
i
say
again
as
you
need
have
no
fear
of
me
i
aint
one
as
likes
to
make
a
talk
and
no
more
is
hayles
give
up
the
girl
and
give
me
your
promise
and
there
aint
a
man
living
as
will
be
the
wiser
mr
wentworth
hold
your
tongue
sir
cried
the
curate
furious
with
indignation
and
resentment
leave
this
place
instantly
if
you
do
want
me
to
pitch
you
into
the
middle
of
the
road
hold
your
tongue
and
go
away
the
man
is
mad
said
mr
wentworth
turning
towards
the
spectator
hayles
and
pausing
to
take
breath
but
it
was
evident
that
this
third
person
was
by
no
means
on
the
curate
side
i
do
know
sir
i
sure
said
hayles
with
a
blank
countenance
it
appears
to
me
sir
as
it
an
awkward
business
for
all
parties
here
the
girl
gone
and
no
one
knows
where
when
a
girl
do
come
back
to
her
own
all
night
things
look
serious
sir
and
it
has
been
said
as
the
last
place
she
was
seen
was
at
your
door
who
says
so
cried
mr
wentworth
well
it
was
a
party
sir
a
highly
respectable
party
as
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
said
hayles
being
a
constant
customer
one
as
there
every
confidence
to
be
put
in
it
better
not
to
name
no
names
being
at
this
period
of
the
affair
and
at
that
moment
unluckily
for
mr
wentworth
there
suddenly
floated
across
his
mind
the
clearest
recollection
of
the
miss
hemmings
and
the
look
they
gave
him
in
passing
he
felt
a
hot
flush
rush
over
his
face
as
he
recalled
it
they
then
were
his
accusers
in
the
first
place
and
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
realise
how
the
tide
of
accusation
would
surge
through
carlingford
and
how
circumstances
would
be
patched
together
and
very
plausible
evidence
concocted
out
of
the
few
facts
which
were
capable
of
an
inference
totally
opposed
to
the
truth
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
in
an
overpowering
glow
and
then
he
felt
the
warm
tide
going
back
upon
his
heart
and
realised
the
position
in
which
he
stood
for
the
first
time
in
its
true
light
and
if
you
let
me
say
it
sir
said
the
judicious
hayles
though
a
man
may
be
in
a
bit
of
a
passion
and
speak
more
strong
that
is
called
for
it
aint
unnatural
in
the
circumstances
things
may
be
better
than
they
appear
said
the
druggist
mildly
i
do
say
nothing
against
that
it
may
be
as
you
took
her
away
sir
if
so
be
as
you
have
took
her
away
for
to
give
her
a
bit
of
education
or
suchlike
before
making
her
your
wife
but
folks
in
general
aint
expected
to
know
that
and
when
a
young
girl
is
kep
out
of
her
for
a
whole
night
it
aint
wonderful
if
her
friends
take
fright
a
sad
thing
for
rosa
whoever
taken
her
away
and
wherever
she
is
now
mr
wentworth
notwithstanding
the
indignant
state
of
mind
which
he
was
in
was
emphatically
of
the
tolerant
temper
which
is
so
curiously
characteristic
of
his
generation
he
could
not
be
unreasonable
even
in
his
own
cause
he
was
not
partisan
enough
even
in
his
own
behalf
to
forget
that
there
was
another
side
to
the
question
nor
to
see
how
hard
and
how
sad
was
that
other
side
he
was
moved
in
spite
of
himself
to
grieve
over
rosa
elsworthy
great
misfortune
poor
little
deluded
child
he
said
sadly
i
acknowledge
it
is
very
dreadful
for
her
and
for
her
friends
i
can
excuse
a
man
who
is
mad
with
grief
and
wretchedness
and
anxiety
and
does
know
what
he
is
saying
as
for
any
man
in
his
senses
imagining
said
the
curate
again
with
a
flush
of
sudden
colour
that
i
could
possibly
be
concerned
in
anything
so
base
that
is
simply
absurd
when
elsworthy
returns
to
reason
and
acknowledges
the
folly
of
what
he
has
said
i
will
do
anything
in
the
world
to
help
him
it
is
unnecessary
for
you
to
wait
said
mr
wentworth
turning
to
sarah
who
had
stolen
up
behind
and
caught
some
of
the
conversation
and
who
was
staring
with
round
eyes
of
wonder
partly
guessing
partly
inquiring
what
had
happened
these
people
want
me
go
indoors
and
never
mind
la
sir
missis
is
all
the
bells
down
to
know
what
said
sarah
holding
her
ground
this
was
how
it
was
to
be
the
name
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
was
to
be
linked
to
that
of
rosa
elsworthy
let
the
truth
be
what
it
might
in
the
mouths
of
every
maid
and
every
mistress
in
carlingford
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
apprehension
of
this
aspect
of
the
matter
and
it
was
not
wonderful
if
mr
wentworth
drew
his
breath
hard
and
set
his
teeth
as
he
ordered
the
woman
away
in
a
tone
which
could
not
be
disobeyed
i
do
want
to
make
no
talk
said
elsworthy
who
during
this
time
had
made
many
efforts
to
speak
i
sait
it
before
and
i
say
it
again
it
mr
wentworth
fault
if
there
any
talk
she
was
seen
here
last
night
he
went
on
rapidly
and
afore
six
this
blessed
morning
you
as
are
never
known
to
be
stirring
early
meets
us
at
the
door
all
shaved
and
dressed
and
it
aint
very
difficult
to
see
to
them
as
watches
the
clergyman
countenance
said
elsworthy
turning
from
one
to
another
as
everything
is
as
straight
as
it
ought
to
be
but
i
aint
going
to
make
no
talk
mr
wentworth
he
went
on
drawing
closer
and
speaking
with
conciliatory
softness
me
and
her
aunt
sir
loves
her
dearly
but
we
not
the
folks
to
stand
in
her
way
if
a
gentleman
was
to
take
a
fancy
to
rosa
if
you
give
me
your
word
to
make
her
your
wife
honourable
and
tell
me
where
she
is
tortures
would
draw
no
complaints
from
me
one
moment
sir
it
aint
only
that
she
pretty
but
she
good
as
well
she
wo
do
you
no
discredit
mr
wentworth
put
her
to
school
or
what
you
please
sir
said
rosa
uncle
me
and
my
wife
will
never
interfere
so
be
as
you
make
her
your
wife
honourable
but
i
aint
a
worm
to
be
trampled
on
cried
elsworthy
as
the
curate
finding
him
approach
very
closely
thrust
him
away
with
vehement
indignation
i
aint
a
slave
to
be
pushed
about
them
as
brings
rosa
to
shame
shall
come
to
shame
by
me
i
ruin
the
man
as
ruins
that
child
you
may
turn
me
out
he
cried
as
the
curate
laid
his
powerful
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
forced
him
towards
the
door
but
i
come
back
and
i
bring
all
carlingford
there
sha
be
a
soul
in
the
town
as
does
know
oh
you
young
viper
as
i
thought
was
a
pious
clergyman
you
aint
got
rid
of
me
my
child
where
my
child
cried
the
infuriated
clerk
as
he
found
himself
ejected
into
the
road
outside
and
the
door
suddenly
closed
upon
him
he
turned
round
to
beat
upon
it
in
blind
fury
and
kept
calling
upon
rosa
and
wasting
his
threats
and
arguments
upon
the
calm
air
outside
some
of
the
in
the
other
houses
came
out
broom
in
hand
to
the
green
doors
to
see
what
was
the
matter
but
they
were
not
near
enough
to
hear
distinctly
and
no
early
wayfarers
had
as
yet
invaded
the
morning
quiet
of
grange
lane
mr
wentworth
white
with
excitement
and
terribly
calm
and
turned
to
the
amazed
and
trembling
druggist
who
still
stood
inside
look
here
hayles
said
the
curate
i
have
never
seen
rosa
elsworthy
since
i
closed
this
door
upon
her
last
night
what
had
brought
her
here
i
do
know
at
least
she
came
with
no
intention
of
seeing
me
and
i
reproved
her
sharply
for
being
out
so
late
this
is
all
i
know
about
the
affair
and
all
i
intend
to
say
to
any
one
if
that
idiot
outside
intends
to
make
a
disturbance
he
must
do
it
i
shall
take
no
further
trouble
to
clear
myself
of
such
an
insane
accusation
i
think
it
right
to
say
as
much
to
you
because
you
seem
to
have
your
senses
about
you
said
the
curate
pausing
out
of
breath
he
was
perfectly
calm
but
it
was
impossible
to
ignore
the
effect
of
such
a
scene
upon
ordinary
flesh
and
blood
his
heart
was
beating
loudly
and
his
breath
came
short
and
quick
he
turned
away
and
walked
up
to
the
and
then
came
back
again
you
understand
me
i
suppose
he
said
and
if
elsworthy
is
not
mad
you
had
better
suggest
to
him
not
to
lose
his
only
chance
of
recovering
rosa
by
vain
bluster
with
me
who
know
nothing
about
her
i
sha
be
idle
in
the
mean
time
said
mr
wentworth
all
this
time
elsworthy
was
beating
against
the
door
and
shouting
his
threats
into
the
quiet
of
the
morning
and
mrs
hadwin
had
thrown
up
her
window
and
stood
there
visibly
in
her
nightcap
trying
to
find
out
what
the
noise
was
about
and
trembling
for
the
respectability
of
her
house
all
which
the
curate
apprehended
with
that
extraordinary
swiftness
and
breadth
of
perception
which
comes
to
men
at
the
eventful
moments
of
life
i
do
my
best
sir
said
hayles
who
felt
that
his
honour
was
appealed
to
but
it
an
awkward
business
for
all
parties
what
it
is
and
the
druggist
backed
out
in
a
state
of
great
bewilderment
having
a
little
struggle
at
the
door
with
elsworthy
to
prevent
his
there
aint
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
said
mr
hayles
as
he
succeeded
at
last
in
leading
his
friend
away
such
was
the
conclusion
of
mr
wentworth
morning
studies
and
the
sermon
which
was
to
have
been
half
written
before
breakfast
upon
that
eventful
saturday
he
went
back
to
the
house
as
was
natural
with
very
different
thoughts
in
his
mind
chapter
xxvi
the
first
thing
mr
wentworth
did
was
to
hasten
to
wodehouse
room
sarah
had
gone
before
him
and
was
by
this
time
talking
to
her
mistress
who
had
left
the
window
and
stood
still
in
her
nightcap
at
the
door
of
her
own
chamber
it
something
about
rosa
elsworthy
said
sarah
she
gone
off
with
some
one
which
nothing
else
was
to
be
expected
and
her
uncle
been
and
at
mr
wentworth
which
proves
as
a
gentleman
should
never
take
no
notice
of
them
i
always
heard
as
she
was
a
bad
lot
oh
mr
wentworth
if
you
would
excuse
my
nightcap
said
mrs
hadwin
i
am
so
shaken
and
all
of
a
tremble
with
that
noise
i
could
help
thinking
it
must
be
a
murder
at
the
least
said
the
little
old
lady
but
i
never
could
believe
that
there
was
anything
between
you
and
sarah
you
may
go
away
i
should
like
to
talk
to
mr
wentworth
by
himself
said
mrs
hadwin
suddenly
remembering
that
mr
wentworth
character
must
not
be
discussed
in
the
presence
of
even
her
favourite
maid
presently
said
the
unhappy
curate
with
mingled
impatience
and
resignation
and
after
a
hasty
knock
at
the
door
he
went
into
wodehouse
room
which
was
opposite
so
full
of
a
furious
anxiety
to
question
him
that
he
had
burst
into
speech
before
he
perceived
that
the
room
was
empty
answer
me
this
instant
he
had
cried
where
is
rosa
elsworthy
and
then
he
paused
utterly
taken
aback
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
the
culprit
would
be
gone
he
had
parted
with
him
late
on
the
previous
night
leaving
him
according
to
appearances
in
a
state
of
sulky
and
now
the
first
impulse
of
his
consternation
was
to
look
in
all
the
corners
for
the
fugitive
the
room
had
evidently
been
occupied
that
night
part
of
the
curate
own
wardrobe
which
he
had
bestowed
upon
his
guest
lay
about
on
the
chairs
and
on
a
little
table
were
his
tools
and
the
bits
of
wood
with
which
he
did
his
carving
the
window
was
open
letting
in
the
fresh
air
and
altogether
the
apartment
looked
so
exactly
like
what
it
might
have
done
had
the
occupant
gone
out
for
a
virtuous
morning
walk
that
mr
wentworth
stopped
short
in
blank
amazement
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
hear
the
curious
sarah
still
rustling
in
the
passage
outside
he
came
out
upon
her
so
hastily
that
sarah
was
startled
perhaps
she
had
been
so
far
excited
out
of
her
usual
propriety
as
to
think
of
the
keyhole
as
a
medium
of
information
where
is
wode
mr
smith
cried
the
curate
he
is
not
in
his
room
he
does
not
generally
get
up
so
early
where
is
he
did
he
go
out
last
night
not
as
i
knows
of
sir
said
sarah
who
grew
a
little
pale
and
gave
a
second
glance
at
the
open
door
is
the
gentleman
in
his
room
he
do
take
a
walk
in
the
morning
now
and
again
and
sarah
cast
an
alarmed
look
behind
to
see
if
her
mistress
was
still
within
hearing
but
mrs
hadwin
intent
on
questioning
mr
wentworth
himself
had
fortunately
retired
to
put
on
her
cap
and
closed
her
door
where
is
he
said
the
curate
firmly
oh
please
sir
i
do
know
said
sarah
who
was
very
near
crying
he
gone
out
for
a
walk
that
all
oh
mr
wentworth
do
look
at
me
so
dreadfully
and
i
tell
you
hall
cried
the
frightened
girl
as
true
as
if
i
was
on
my
oath
he
a
taking
way
with
him
said
poor
sarah
to
whom
the
sulky
and
shabby
rascal
was
radiant
still
with
the
fascinating
though
faded
glory
of
a
gentleman
and
he
aint
one
as
has
been
used
to
regular
hours
and
seeing
as
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
i
knew
as
hall
was
safe
mr
wentworth
and
oh
sir
if
you
not
tell
missis
as
might
be
angry
i
did
mean
no
harm
and
knowing
as
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
i
let
him
have
the
key
of
the
little
door
here
sarah
put
her
apron
to
her
eyes
she
did
not
cry
much
into
it
or
wet
it
with
her
tears
but
under
its
cover
she
peeped
at
mr
wentworth
and
encouraged
by
his
looks
which
did
not
seem
to
promise
any
immediate
catastrophe
went
on
with
her
explanation
he
been
and
took
a
walk
often
in
the
morning
said
sarah
with
little
gasps
which
interrupted
her
voice
and
come
in
as
steady
as
steady
and
nothing
happened
he
gone
for
a
walk
now
poor
gentleman
them
as
goes
out
first
thing
in
the
morning
ca
mean
no
harm
mr
wentworth
if
it
was
at
night
it
would
be
different
said
the
apologetic
sarah
he
be
in
afore
we
done
our
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
that
his
hour
for
i
always
brings
him
a
cup
of
coffee
if
you
had
been
up
not
till
hour
sir
you
never
have
known
nothing
about
it
and
here
even
mrs
hadwin
housemaid
looked
sharply
in
the
curate
face
i
never
knew
you
so
early
sir
not
since
i
been
here
said
sarah
and
though
she
was
a
partisan
of
mr
wentworth
it
occurred
even
to
sarah
that
perhaps
after
all
elsworthy
might
be
right
if
he
comes
in
let
me
know
immediately
said
the
curate
and
he
went
to
his
study
and
shut
himself
in
to
think
it
all
over
with
a
sense
of
being
baited
and
baffled
on
every
side
as
for
sarah
she
went
off
in
great
excitement
to
discuss
the
whole
business
with
the
cook
tossing
her
head
as
she
went
rosa
elsworthy
indeed
said
sarah
to
herself
thinking
her
own
claims
to
admiration
quite
as
well
worth
considering
and
mr
wentworth
had
already
lost
one
humble
follower
in
grange
lane
the
curate
sat
down
at
his
table
as
before
and
gazed
with
a
kind
of
exasperation
at
the
paper
and
the
text
out
of
which
his
sermon
was
to
have
come
when
the
wicked
man
turneth
away
from
the
evil
of
his
ways
he
began
to
wonder
bitterly
whether
that
ever
happened
or
if
it
was
any
good
trying
to
bring
it
about
if
it
were
really
the
case
that
wodehouse
whom
he
had
been
labouring
to
save
from
the
consequences
of
one
crime
had
at
the
very
crisis
of
his
fate
perpetrated
another
of
the
basest
kind
what
was
the
good
of
wasting
strength
in
behalf
of
a
wretch
so
abandoned
why
should
such
a
man
be
permitted
to
live
to
bring
shame
and
misery
on
everybody
connected
with
him
and
why
when
noxious
vermin
of
every
other
description
were
hunted
down
and
exterminated
should
the
vile
human
creature
be
spared
to
suck
the
blood
of
his
friends
mr
wentworth
grew
sanguinary
in
his
thoughts
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
tried
to
return
to
the
train
of
reflection
which
elsworthy
arrival
had
banished
that
was
totally
impossible
but
another
train
of
ideas
came
fast
enough
to
fill
up
the
vacant
space
the
curate
saw
himself
hemmed
in
on
every
side
without
any
way
of
escape
if
he
could
not
extract
any
information
from
wodehouse
or
if
wodehouse
denied
any
knowledge
of
rosa
what
could
he
do
to
clear
himself
from
an
imputation
so
terrible
and
if
on
the
other
hand
wodehouse
did
not
come
back
and
so
pleaded
guilty
how
could
he
pursue
and
put
the
law
upon
the
track
of
the
man
whom
he
had
just
been
labouring
to
save
from
justice
and
over
whose
head
a
criminal
prosecution
was
impending
mr
wentworth
saw
nothing
but
misery
let
him
turn
where
he
would
nothing
but
disgrace
misapprehension
unjust
blame
he
divined
with
the
instinct
of
a
man
in
deadly
peril
that
elsworthy
who
was
a
mean
enough
man
in
common
circumstances
had
been
inspired
by
the
supposed
injury
he
had
sustained
into
a
relentless
demon
and
he
saw
distinctly
how
strong
the
chain
of
evidence
was
against
him
and
how
little
he
could
do
to
clear
himself
as
his
miseries
grew
upon
him
he
got
up
as
was
natural
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
to
walk
down
his
impatience
if
he
could
and
acquire
sufficient
composure
to
enable
him
to
wait
for
the
time
when
wodehouse
might
be
expected
to
arrive
mr
wentworth
had
forgotten
at
the
moment
that
mrs
hadwin
room
was
next
to
his
study
and
that
as
she
stood
putting
on
her
cap
his
footsteps
vibrated
along
the
flooring
which
thrilled
under
her
feet
almost
as
much
as
under
his
own
mrs
hadwin
as
she
stood
before
her
glass
smoothing
her
thin
little
braids
of
white
hair
and
putting
on
her
cap
could
not
but
wonder
to
herself
what
could
make
mr
wentworth
walk
about
the
room
in
such
an
agitated
way
it
was
not
by
any
means
the
custom
of
the
perpetual
curate
who
up
to
the
time
of
his
aunts
arrival
in
carlingford
had
known
no
special
disturbances
in
his
individual
career
and
then
the
old
lady
thought
of
that
report
about
little
rosa
elsworthy
which
she
had
never
believed
and
grew
troubled
as
old
ladies
are
not
unapt
to
do
under
such
circumstances
with
all
that
lively
faith
in
the
seductions
of
an
artful
girl
and
all
that
contemptuous
pity
for
a
poor
young
man
which
seems
to
come
natural
to
a
woman
all
the
old
ladies
in
carlingford
male
and
female
were
but
too
likely
to
entertain
the
same
sentiments
which
at
least
if
they
did
nothing
else
showed
a
wonderful
faith
in
the
power
of
love
and
folly
common
to
human
nature
it
did
not
occur
to
mrs
hadwin
any
more
than
it
did
to
miss
dora
that
mr
wentworth
good
sense
and
pride
and
superior
cultivation
were
sufficient
defences
against
little
rosa
dimpled
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
and
with
some
few
exceptions
such
was
likely
to
be
the
opinion
of
the
little
world
of
carlingford
mrs
hadwin
grew
more
and
more
anxious
about
the
business
as
she
felt
the
boards
thrill
under
her
feet
and
heard
the
impatient
movements
in
the
next
room
and
as
soon
as
she
had
settled
her
cap
to
her
satisfaction
she
left
her
own
chamber
and
went
to
knock
as
was
to
be
expected
at
mr
wentworth
door
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
mr
wentworth
saw
wodehouse
shabby
figure
entering
at
the
he
turned
round
suddenly
without
hearing
mrs
hadwin
knock
and
all
but
ran
over
the
old
lady
in
his
haste
and
eagerness
pardon
me
i
am
in
a
great
hurry
said
the
curate
darting
past
her
just
at
the
moment
when
she
expected
her
curiosity
to
be
satisfied
it
was
rather
hard
upon
mrs
hadwin
to
be
dismissed
so
summarily
she
went
in
a
state
of
great
dignity
with
her
lace
mittens
on
and
her
hands
crossed
before
her
she
felt
she
had
more
and
more
reason
for
doubting
human
nature
in
general
and
for
believing
that
the
curate
of
st
roque
in
particular
could
not
bear
any
close
examination
into
his
conduct
mrs
hadwin
sat
down
to
her
breakfast
accordingly
with
a
sense
of
pitying
virtue
which
was
sweet
to
her
spirit
notwithstanding
that
she
was
as
she
would
have
frankly
acknowledged
very
fond
of
mr
wentworth
she
said
poor
young
man
to
herself
and
shook
her
head
over
him
as
she
poured
out
her
solitary
cup
of
tea
she
had
never
been
a
beauty
herself
nor
had
she
exercised
any
overwhelming
influence
that
she
could
remember
over
any
one
in
the
days
of
her
distant
youth
but
being
a
true
woman
mrs
hadwin
believed
in
rosa
elsworthy
and
pitied
not
without
a
certain
female
disdain
the
weakness
of
the
inevitable
victim
he
did
not
dare
to
stop
to
explain
to
what
it
meant
he
rushed
out
of
her
way
as
soon
as
he
saw
she
meant
to
question
him
that
designing
girl
had
got
him
entirely
under
her
sway
the
poor
young
man
meanwhile
the
curate
without
a
single
thought
for
his
landlady
made
a
rush
to
wodehouse
room
he
did
not
wait
for
any
answer
to
his
knock
but
went
in
not
as
a
matter
of
policy
but
because
his
eagerness
carried
him
on
in
spite
of
himself
to
mr
wentworth
great
amazement
wodehouse
was
undressing
intending
apparently
to
return
to
bed
the
shabby
fugitive
looking
broad
and
brawny
in
his
turned
round
when
he
heard
the
voice
with
an
angry
exclamation
his
face
grew
black
as
he
saw
the
curate
at
the
door
what
the
deuce
have
you
to
do
in
my
room
at
this
hour
he
growled
into
his
beard
is
a
man
never
to
have
a
little
peace
and
with
that
threw
down
his
coat
which
he
still
had
in
his
hand
and
faced
round
towards
the
intruder
with
sullen
looks
it
was
his
nature
to
stand
always
on
the
defensive
and
he
had
got
so
much
accustomed
to
being
regarded
as
a
culprit
that
he
naturally
took
up
the
part
whether
there
might
be
just
occasion
or
not
where
have
you
been
exclaimed
the
curate
answer
me
truly
i
submit
to
any
evasion
i
know
it
all
wodehouse
where
is
she
where
have
you
hid
her
if
you
do
not
give
her
up
i
must
give
you
up
to
justice
do
you
hear
me
where
is
rosa
elsworthy
this
is
a
matter
that
touches
my
honour
and
i
must
know
the
truth
mr
wentworth
was
so
full
of
the
subject
that
it
did
not
occur
to
him
how
much
time
he
was
giving
his
antagonist
to
prepare
his
answer
though
wodehouse
was
not
clever
he
had
the
instinct
of
a
baited
animal
driven
to
bay
and
resistance
and
denial
came
natural
to
a
man
who
had
been
accused
and
condemned
all
his
life
rosa
elsworthy
said
the
vagabond
what
have
i
to
do
with
rosa
elsworthy
a
pretty
man
i
should
be
to
run
away
with
a
girl
all
that
i
have
in
the
world
is
a
shilling
or
two
and
by
jove
it
an
expensive
business
that
is
you
should
ask
your
brother
he
continued
giving
a
furtive
glance
at
the
curate
it
more
in
his
way
by
jove
than
mine
mr
wentworth
was
recalled
to
himself
by
this
reply
where
is
she
he
said
sternly
no
trifling
i
did
not
ask
if
you
had
taken
her
away
i
ask
where
is
she
he
had
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
facing
wodehouse
and
overawing
him
by
his
superior
stature
force
and
virtue
before
the
curate
look
the
eyes
of
the
other
fell
but
he
had
fallen
by
chance
on
a
reasonable
defence
enough
and
so
long
as
he
held
by
that
felt
himself
tolerably
safe
i
do
know
anything
about
her
he
repeated
how
should
i
know
anything
about
her
i
aint
a
fool
by
jove
whatever
i
may
be
a
man
may
talk
to
a
pretty
girl
without
any
harm
i
may
be
as
good
as
a
parson
but
by
jove
i
aint
a
fool
he
muttered
through
his
beard
he
had
begun
to
speak
with
a
kind
of
sulky
but
his
voice
sunk
lower
as
he
proceeded
jack
wentworth
elegant
levity
was
a
terrible
failure
in
the
hands
of
the
coarser
rascal
he
fell
back
by
degrees
upon
the
only
natural
quality
which
enabled
him
to
offer
any
resistance
by
jove
i
aint
an
idiot
he
repeated
with
dull
obstinacy
and
upon
that
statement
made
a
stand
in
his
dogged
argumentative
way
would
you
like
it
better
if
i
said
you
were
a
villain
asked
the
exasperated
curate
i
do
want
to
discuss
your
character
with
you
where
is
rosa
elsworthy
she
is
scarcely
more
than
a
child
said
mr
wentworth
and
a
fool
if
you
like
but
where
is
she
i
warn
you
that
unless
you
tell
me
you
shall
have
no
more
assistance
from
me
and
i
tell
you
that
i
do
know
said
wodehouse
and
the
two
men
stood
facing
each
other
one
glowing
with
youthful
indignation
the
other
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
sullen
resistance
just
then
there
came
a
soft
knock
at
the
door
and
sarah
peeped
in
with
a
coquettish
air
which
at
no
other
time
in
her
existence
had
been
visible
in
the
sedate
demeanour
of
mrs
hadwin
favourite
handmaid
the
stranger
lodger
was
a
gentleman
notwithstanding
his
shabbiness
and
he
was
a
very
gentleman
without
a
bit
of
pride
and
sarah
was
still
a
woman
though
she
was
plain
and
a
housemaid
please
sir
brought
you
your
coffee
said
sarah
and
she
carried
in
her
tray
which
contained
all
the
materials
for
a
plentiful
breakfast
when
she
saw
mr
wentworth
standing
in
the
room
and
wodehouse
in
his
sarah
said
la
and
set
down
her
tray
hastily
and
vanished
but
the
episode
short
as
it
was
had
not
been
without
its
use
to
the
culprit
who
was
standing
on
his
defence
i
not
staying
here
on
my
own
account
said
wodehouse
it
no
pleasure
to
me
to
be
here
i
staying
for
your
brother
sake
and
other
people
it
no
pleasure
to
me
by
jove
i
go
if
i
had
my
way
but
i
aint
a
fool
continued
the
sulky
defendant
it
of
no
use
asking
me
such
questions
by
jove
i
other
things
to
think
of
than
girls
and
you
know
pretty
well
how
much
money
i
got
he
continued
taking
out
an
old
purse
and
emptying
out
the
few
shillings
it
contained
into
his
hand
when
he
had
thrown
them
about
out
and
in
for
nearly
a
minute
he
turned
once
more
upon
the
curate
i
like
to
have
a
little
more
before
i
ran
away
with
any
one
said
wodehouse
and
tossed
the
shillings
back
contemptuously
as
for
mr
wentworth
his
reasonableness
once
more
came
greatly
in
his
way
he
began
to
ask
himself
whether
this
penniless
vagabond
who
seemed
to
have
no
dash
or
daring
in
his
character
could
have
been
the
man
to
carry
little
rosa
away
and
perplexed
by
this
idea
mr
wentworth
put
himself
unawares
into
the
position
of
his
opponent
and
in
that
character
made
an
appeal
to
his
imaginary
generosity
and
truth
wodehouse
he
said
seriously
look
here
i
am
likely
to
be
much
annoyed
about
this
and
perhaps
injured
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
if
you
know
where
the
girl
is
i
been
at
some
little
trouble
for
you
be
frank
with
me
for
once
said
the
curate
of
st
roque
nothing
in
existence
could
have
prevented
himself
from
responding
to
such
an
appeal
and
he
made
it
with
a
kind
of
absurd
confidence
that
there
must
be
some
kindred
depths
even
in
the
meaner
nature
with
which
he
had
to
deal
which
would
have
been
to
jack
wentworth
had
he
seen
it
a
source
of
inextinguishable
laughter
even
wodehouse
was
taken
by
surprise
he
did
not
understand
mr
wentworth
but
a
certain
vague
idea
that
the
curate
was
addressing
him
as
if
he
still
were
a
gentleman
as
he
used
to
be
though
it
did
not
alter
his
resolution
in
any
way
brought
a
vague
flush
of
shame
to
his
unaccustomed
cheek
i
aint
a
fool
he
repeated
rather
hastily
and
turned
away
not
to
meet
the
curate
eyes
i
got
no
money
how
should
know
anything
about
her
if
i
had
do
you
think
i
should
have
been
here
he
continued
with
a
sidelong
look
of
inquiry
then
he
paused
and
put
on
his
coat
and
in
that
garb
felt
himself
more
of
a
match
for
his
opponent
i
tell
you
one
thing
you
thank
me
for
he
said
the
old
man
is
dying
they
think
they
be
sending
for
you
presently
that
more
important
than
a
talk
about
a
girl
i
been
talked
to
till
i
sick
said
wodehouse
with
a
little
burst
of
irrepressible
nature
but
things
may
change
before
you
all
know
where
you
are
when
he
had
said
so
much
the
fear
in
his
heart
awoke
again
and
he
cast
another
look
of
inquiry
and
anxiety
at
the
curate
face
but
mr
wentworth
was
disgusted
and
had
no
more
to
say
everything
changes
except
the
heart
of
the
churl
which
can
never
be
made
bountiful
said
the
indignant
young
priest
it
was
not
a
fit
sentiment
perhaps
for
a
preacher
who
had
just
written
that
text
about
the
wicked
man
turning
from
the
evil
of
his
ways
mr
wentworth
went
away
in
a
glow
of
indignation
and
excitement
and
left
his
guest
to
sarah
bountiful
provision
of
hot
coffee
and
eggs
to
which
wodehouse
addressed
himself
with
a
perfectly
good
appetite
notwithstanding
all
the
events
of
the
morning
and
all
the
mystery
of
the
night
chapter
xxvii
mr
wentworth
retired
to
his
own
quarters
with
enough
to
think
about
for
one
morning
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
about
wodehouse
whether
he
was
guilty
or
not
guilty
it
seemed
incredible
that
penniless
as
he
was
he
could
have
succeeded
in
carrying
off
a
girl
so
well
known
in
carlingford
as
rosa
elsworthy
and
if
he
had
taken
her
away
how
did
it
happen
that
he
himself
had
come
back
again
the
curate
saw
clearly
enough
that
his
only
chance
for
exculpating
himself
in
the
sight
of
the
multitude
was
by
bringing
home
the
guilt
to
somebody
else
and
in
proportion
to
the
utter
scorn
with
which
he
had
treated
insinuations
at
first
was
his
serious
apprehension
now
of
the
danger
which
surrounded
him
he
divined
all
that
slander
would
make
of
it
with
the
quickened
intelligence
of
a
man
whose
entire
life
and
reputation
dearer
than
life
were
at
stake
if
it
could
not
be
cleared
up
if
even
any
investigation
which
he
might
be
able
to
demand
was
not
perfectly
successful
mr
wentworth
was
quite
well
aware
that
the
character
of
a
clergyman
was
almost
as
susceptible
as
that
of
a
woman
and
that
the
vague
stigma
might
haunt
and
overshadow
him
all
his
life
the
thought
was
overwhelming
at
this
moment
when
his
first
hopes
of
finding
a
speedy
solution
of
the
mystery
had
come
to
nothing
if
he
had
but
lived
a
century
earlier
the
chances
are
that
no
doubt
of
wodehouse
guilt
would
have
entered
his
mind
but
mr
wentworth
was
a
man
of
the
present
age
reasonable
to
a
fault
and
apt
to
consider
other
people
as
much
as
possible
from
their
own
point
of
view
he
did
not
see
looking
at
the
circumstances
how
wodehouse
be
guilty
and
the
curate
would
not
permit
the
strong
instinctive
certainty
that
he
guilty
to
move
his
own
mind
from
what
he
imagined
to
be
its
better
judgment
he
was
thinking
it
over
very
gloomily
when
his
breakfast
was
brought
to
him
and
his
letters
feeling
that
he
could
be
sure
of
nobody
in
such
an
emergency
and
dreading
more
the
doubt
of
his
friends
than
the
clamour
of
the
general
world
he
could
bear
he
imagined
to
be
hooted
at
in
the
streets
if
it
ever
came
to
that
but
to
see
the
faces
of
those
who
loved
him
troubled
with
a
torturing
doubt
of
his
truth
was
a
terrible
thought
to
the
perpetual
curate
and
lucy
but
here
the
young
man
got
up
indignant
and
threw
off
his
fears
he
doubted
her
regard
with
a
doubt
which
threw
darkness
over
the
whole
universe
but
that
she
should
be
able
for
a
moment
to
doubt
his
entire
devotion
to
her
seemed
a
blindness
incredible
no
let
who
would
believe
ill
of
him
in
this
respect
to
lucy
such
an
accusation
must
look
as
monstrous
as
it
was
untrue
at
least
knew
otherwise
and
taking
this
false
comfort
to
his
heart
mr
wentworth
took
up
his
letters
and
presently
was
deep
in
the
anxieties
of
his
brother
gerald
who
wrote
to
him
as
to
a
man
at
leisure
and
without
any
overwhelming
perplexities
of
his
own
it
requires
a
very
high
amount
of
unselfishness
in
the
person
thus
addressed
to
prevent
a
degree
of
irritation
which
is
much
opposed
to
sympathy
and
mr
wentworth
though
he
was
very
impartial
and
reasonable
was
not
being
still
young
and
meaning
to
be
happy
unselfish
to
any
inhuman
degree
he
put
down
gerald
letter
after
he
had
read
through
half
of
it
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
which
he
could
not
restrain
and
then
poured
out
his
coffee
which
had
got
cold
in
the
mean
time
and
gulped
it
down
with
a
sense
of
disgust
for
there
are
moments
when
the
mortification
of
the
flesh
is
a
relief
to
the
spirit
and
then
it
occurred
to
him
to
remember
wodehouse
tray
which
was
a
kind
of
to
the
shabby
vagabond
and
the
perfect
good
order
in
which
had
his
breakfast
and
mr
wentworth
laughed
at
himself
with
a
whimsical
perception
of
all
that
was
absurd
in
his
own
position
which
did
him
good
and
broke
the
spell
of
his
solitary
musings
when
he
took
up
gerald
letter
again
he
read
it
through
a
man
more
sympathetic
and
unselfish
than
gerald
wentworth
did
not
exist
in
the
world
as
his
brother
well
knew
but
nevertheless
gerald
mind
was
so
entirely
preoccupied
that
he
passed
over
the
curate
cares
with
the
lightest
reference
imaginable
i
hope
you
found
all
right
when
you
got
back
and
nothing
seriously
amiss
with
jack
the
elder
brother
wrote
and
then
went
on
to
his
own
affairs
all
right
nothing
seriously
amiss
to
a
man
who
felt
himself
standing
on
the
edge
of
possible
ruin
such
expressions
seemed
strange
indeed
the
rector
of
wentworth
however
had
enough
in
his
mind
to
excuse
him
for
a
momentary
forgetfulness
of
others
things
had
taken
a
different
turn
with
him
since
his
brother
left
he
had
been
so
busy
with
his
change
of
faith
and
sentiment
that
the
practical
possibilities
of
the
step
which
he
contemplated
had
not
disturbed
gerald
he
had
taken
it
calmly
for
granted
that
he
do
what
he
wanted
to
do
but
a
new
light
had
burst
upon
him
in
that
respect
and
changed
the
character
of
his
thoughts
notwithstanding
the
conviction
into
which
he
had
reasoned
himself
the
rector
of
wentworth
had
not
contemplated
the
idea
of
becoming
simply
a
catholic
layman
he
was
nothing
if
not
a
priest
he
had
said
passionately
he
could
have
made
a
martyr
of
himself
have
suffered
tortures
and
deaths
with
the
steadiest
endurance
but
he
could
not
face
the
idea
of
taking
all
meaning
and
significance
out
of
his
life
by
giving
up
the
profession
which
he
felt
to
be
laid
upon
him
by
orders
indelible
beyond
the
power
of
circumstances
to
revoke
such
was
the
new
complication
to
which
gerald
had
come
he
was
terribly
staggered
in
his
previous
resolution
by
this
new
doubt
and
he
wrote
to
pour
his
difficulties
into
the
ear
of
his
brother
it
had
been
frank
question
which
first
awoke
in
his
mind
a
doubt
as
to
the
practicability
of
the
step
he
contemplated
and
one
of
louisa
relations
appealed
to
by
her
in
her
next
access
of
terror
had
brought
this
aspect
of
the
matter
still
more
distinctly
before
the
rector
of
wentworth
gerald
had
been
studying
canon
law
but
his
english
intelligence
did
not
make
very
much
of
it
and
the
bare
idea
of
a
dispensation
making
that
right
which
in
itself
was
wrong
touched
the
gentleman
to
the
quick
and
brought
him
to
a
sudden
standstill
he
who
was
nothing
if
not
a
priest
stood
sorrowfully
looking
at
his
contemplated
martyrdom
like
brother
domenico
of
st
mark
sighing
on
the
edge
of
the
fiery
ordeal
into
which
the
church
herself
would
not
let
him
plunge
if
it
was
so
he
no
longer
knew
what
to
do
he
would
have
wrapped
the
vestment
of
the
new
priesthood
about
him
though
it
was
a
garment
of
fire
but
to
stand
aside
in
irksome
leisure
was
a
harder
trial
at
which
he
trembled
this
was
the
new
complication
in
which
gerald
asked
his
brother
sympathy
and
counsel
it
was
a
long
letter
curiously
introspective
and
full
of
and
it
was
hard
work
with
a
mind
so
occupied
as
was
that
of
the
perpetual
curate
to
give
it
due
attention
he
put
it
away
when
he
had
done
with
his
cold
breakfast
and
deferred
the
consideration
of
the
subject
with
a
kind
of
vague
hope
that
the
family
firmament
might
possibly
brighten
in
that
quarter
at
least
but
the
and
indistinct
interest
with
which
he
viewed
across
his
own
gloomy
surroundings
this
matter
which
had
engrossed
him
so
completely
a
few
days
before
was
wonderful
to
see
and
then
he
paused
to
think
what
he
was
to
do
to
go
out
and
face
the
slander
which
must
already
have
crept
forth
on
its
way
to
see
elsworthy
and
ascertain
whether
he
had
come
to
his
senses
and
try
if
anything
could
be
done
for
rosa
discovery
to
exert
himself
somehow
in
short
and
get
rid
of
the
feverish
activity
which
he
felt
consuming
him
that
was
what
he
longed
to
do
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
saturday
and
mr
wentworth
was
conscious
that
it
would
be
more
dignified
and
in
better
taste
altogether
if
he
went
on
writing
his
sermon
and
took
no
notice
of
this
occurrence
with
which
in
reality
he
had
nothing
to
do
it
was
difficult
but
no
doubt
it
was
the
best
and
he
tried
it
accordingly
putting
down
a
great
many
sentences
which
had
to
be
scratched
out
again
and
spoiling
altogether
the
appearance
of
the
when
a
message
came
from
mr
wodehouse
about
eleven
bringing
the
news
that
he
was
much
worse
and
not
expected
to
live
and
begging
mr
wentworth
immediate
presence
the
curate
was
as
nearly
glad
as
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
be
under
the
circumstances
he
had
a
feeling
heart
as
even
elsworthy
allowed
but
in
such
a
moment
of
excitement
any
kind
of
great
and
terrible
event
seemed
to
come
natural
he
hastened
out
into
the
fresh
morning
sunshine
which
still
seemed
thrilling
with
life
and
joy
and
went
up
grange
lane
with
a
certain
sense
of
curiosity
wondering
whether
everybody
was
already
aware
of
what
had
happened
a
long
way
off
a
figure
which
much
resembled
that
of
the
rector
was
visible
crossing
over
to
dr
marjoribanks
door
and
it
occurred
to
the
curate
that
mr
morgan
was
crossing
to
avoid
him
which
brought
a
smile
of
anger
and
involuntary
dislike
to
his
face
and
nerved
him
for
any
other
encounter
the
green
door
at
mr
wodehouse
a
homely
sign
of
the
trouble
in
the
house
had
been
left
unlatched
and
was
swinging
ajar
with
the
wind
when
the
curate
came
up
and
as
he
went
in
closing
it
carefully
after
him
for
that
forlorn
little
touch
of
carelessness
went
to
his
heart
he
encountered
in
the
garden
dr
marjoribanks
and
dr
rider
who
were
coming
out
together
with
very
grave
looks
they
did
not
stop
for
much
conversation
only
pausing
to
tell
him
that
the
case
was
hopeless
and
that
the
patient
could
not
possibly
live
beyond
a
day
or
two
at
most
but
even
in
the
few
words
that
were
spoken
mr
wentworth
perceived
or
thought
he
perceived
that
something
had
occurred
to
lessen
him
in
the
esteem
of
the
shrewd
old
scotch
doctor
who
contemplated
him
and
his
with
critical
eyes
i
confess
after
all
that
there
are
cases
in
which
written
prayers
are
a
kind
of
security
dr
marjoribanks
said
in
an
irrelevant
manner
to
dr
rider
when
mr
wentworth
had
passed
them
an
observation
at
which
in
ordinary
cases
the
curate
would
have
smiled
but
the
colour
rose
to
his
face
and
he
understood
that
dr
marjoribanks
did
not
think
him
qualified
to
carry
comfort
or
instruction
to
a
perhaps
the
old
doctor
had
no
such
idea
in
his
mind
perhaps
it
was
simply
a
relic
of
his
national
presbyterianism
to
which
the
old
scotchman
kept
up
a
kind
of
visionary
allegiance
but
whether
he
meant
it
or
not
mr
wentworth
understood
it
as
a
reproach
to
himself
and
went
on
with
a
bitter
feeling
of
mortification
to
the
he
had
gone
with
his
whole
heart
into
his
priestly
office
and
had
been
noted
for
his
ministrations
to
the
sick
and
poor
but
now
his
feelings
were
much
too
personal
for
the
atmosphere
into
which
he
was
just
about
to
enter
he
stopped
at
the
door
to
tell
john
that
he
would
take
a
stroll
round
the
garden
before
he
came
in
as
he
had
a
headache
and
went
on
through
the
walks
which
were
sacred
to
lucy
not
thinking
of
her
but
wondering
bitterly
whether
anybody
would
stand
by
him
or
whether
an
utterly
baseless
slander
would
outweigh
all
the
five
years
of
his
life
which
he
had
spent
among
the
people
of
carlingford
meanwhile
john
stood
at
the
door
and
watched
him
and
of
course
thought
it
was
very
queer
it
aint
as
if
he
sitting
up
all
night
like
our
young
ladies
said
john
to
himself
and
unconsciously
noted
the
circumstance
down
in
his
memory
against
the
curate
when
mr
wentworth
entered
the
he
found
all
very
silent
and
still
in
that
darkened
chamber
lucy
was
seated
by
the
bedside
wrapped
in
a
loose
and
looked
as
if
she
had
not
slept
for
several
nights
while
miss
wodehouse
who
notwithstanding
all
her
anxiety
to
be
of
use
was
far
more
helpless
than
lucy
stood
on
the
side
next
the
door
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
sister
watching
with
pathetic
unserviceableness
for
the
moment
when
she
could
be
of
some
use
as
for
the
patient
himself
he
lay
in
a
kind
of
stupor
from
which
he
scarcely
ever
could
be
roused
and
showed
no
tokens
at
the
moment
of
hearing
or
seeing
anybody
the
scene
was
doubly
sad
but
it
was
without
the
excitement
which
so
often
breathes
in
the
atmosphere
of
death
there
was
no
eager
listening
for
the
last
word
no
last
outbreaks
of
tenderness
the
daughters
were
both
hushed
into
utter
silence
and
lucy
who
was
more
reasonable
than
her
sister
had
even
given
up
those
wistful
beseeching
looks
at
the
patient
with
which
miss
wodehouse
still
regarded
him
as
if
perhaps
he
might
be
thus
persuaded
to
speak
the
nurse
whom
dr
marjoribanks
had
sent
to
assist
them
was
visible
through
an
open
door
sleeping
very
comfortably
in
the
adjoining
room
mr
wentworth
came
into
the
silent
chamber
with
all
his
anxieties
throbbing
in
his
heart
bringing
life
at
its
very
height
of
agitation
and
tumult
into
the
presence
of
death
he
went
forward
to
the
bed
and
tried
for
an
instant
to
call
up
any
spark
of
intelligence
that
might
yet
exist
within
the
mind
of
the
dying
man
but
mr
wodehouse
was
beyond
the
voice
of
any
priest
the
curate
said
the
prayers
for
the
dying
at
the
bedside
suddenly
filled
with
a
great
pity
for
the
man
who
was
thus
taking
leave
unawares
of
all
this
mournful
splendid
world
though
the
young
man
knew
many
an
ordinary
sentiment
about
the
vanity
of
life
and
had
given
utterance
to
that
effect
freely
in
the
way
of
his
duty
he
was
still
too
fresh
in
his
heart
to
conceive
actually
that
any
one
could
leave
the
world
without
poignant
regrets
and
when
his
prayer
was
finished
he
stood
looking
at
the
patient
with
inexpressible
compassion
mr
wodehouse
had
scarcely
reached
old
age
he
was
well
off
and
only
a
week
ago
seemed
to
have
so
much
to
enjoy
now
here
he
lay
stupefied
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
unable
to
respond
even
by
a
look
to
the
love
that
surrounded
him
once
more
there
rose
in
the
heart
of
the
young
priest
a
natural
impulse
of
resentment
and
indignation
and
when
he
thought
of
the
cause
of
this
change
he
remembered
wodehouse
threat
and
roused
himself
from
his
contemplation
of
the
dying
to
think
of
the
probable
fate
of
those
who
must
live
has
he
made
his
will
said
mr
wentworth
suddenly
he
forgot
that
it
was
lucy
who
was
standing
by
him
and
it
was
only
when
he
caught
a
glance
of
reproach
and
horror
from
her
eyes
that
he
recollected
how
abrupt
his
question
was
pardon
me
he
said
you
think
me
heartless
to
speak
of
it
at
such
a
time
but
tell
me
if
you
know
miss
wodehouse
has
he
made
his
will
oh
mr
wentworth
i
do
know
anything
about
business
said
the
elder
sister
he
said
he
would
but
we
have
had
other
things
to
think
of
more
important
things
said
poor
miss
wodehouse
wringing
her
hands
and
looking
at
mr
wentworth
with
eyes
full
of
warning
and
meaning
beseeching
him
not
to
betray
her
secret
she
came
nearer
to
the
side
of
the
bed
on
which
lucy
and
the
curate
were
standing
and
plucked
at
his
sleeve
in
her
anxiety
we
have
had
very
different
things
to
think
of
oh
mr
wentworth
what
does
it
matter
said
the
poor
lady
interposing
her
anxious
looks
which
suggested
every
kind
of
misfortune
between
the
two
it
matters
everything
in
the
world
said
mr
wentworth
pardon
me
if
i
wound
you
i
must
speak
if
it
is
possible
to
rouse
him
an
effort
must
be
made
send
for
mr
waters
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
go
out
of
the
world
and
leave
your
interests
in
the
hands
of
oh
hush
mr
wentworth
hush
oh
hush
hush
do
say
any
more
cried
miss
wodehouse
grasping
his
arm
in
her
terror
lucy
rose
from
where
she
had
been
sitting
at
the
bedside
she
had
grown
paler
than
before
and
looked
almost
stern
in
her
youthful
gravity
i
will
not
permit
my
father
to
be
disturbed
she
said
i
do
know
what
you
mean
or
what
you
are
talking
of
but
he
is
not
to
be
disturbed
do
you
think
i
will
let
him
be
vexed
in
his
last
hours
about
money
or
anybody
interest
she
said
turning
upon
the
curate
a
momentary
glance
of
scorn
then
she
sat
down
again
with
a
pang
of
disappointment
added
to
her
grief
she
could
not
keep
her
heart
so
much
apart
from
him
as
not
to
expect
a
little
comfort
from
his
presence
and
there
had
been
comfort
in
his
prayers
and
his
looks
but
to
hear
him
speak
of
wills
and
worldly
affairs
by
her
deathbed
as
any
man
might
have
done
went
to
lucy
heart
she
sat
down
again
putting
her
hand
softly
upon
the
edge
of
the
pillow
to
guard
the
peace
of
those
last
moments
which
were
ebbing
away
so
rapidly
what
if
all
the
comfort
of
the
world
hung
upon
it
could
she
let
her
kind
father
be
troubled
in
his
end
for
anything
so
miserable
lucy
turned
her
indignant
eyes
upon
the
others
with
silent
resolution
it
was
she
who
was
protector
now
but
it
must
be
done
said
mr
wentworth
you
will
understand
me
hereafter
miss
wodehouse
you
must
send
for
mr
waters
and
in
the
mean
time
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
rouse
him
it
is
no
such
cruelty
as
you
think
said
the
curate
with
humility
it
is
not
for
money
or
interest
only
it
concerns
all
the
comfort
of
your
life
this
he
said
to
lucy
who
sat
defending
her
father
she
for
her
part
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
that
broke
his
heart
at
that
moment
of
all
others
the
unfortunate
curate
perceived
by
a
sudden
flash
of
insight
that
nothing
less
than
love
could
look
at
him
with
such
force
of
disappointment
and
reproach
and
wounded
feeling
he
replied
to
the
look
by
a
gesture
of
mingled
entreaty
and
despair
what
can
i
do
he
cried
you
have
no
one
else
to
care
for
you
i
can
not
even
explain
to
you
all
that
is
at
stake
i
must
act
as
i
ought
even
though
you
hate
me
for
it
let
us
send
for
mr
waters
if
there
is
a
will
mr
wentworth
had
raised
his
voice
a
little
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
the
word
caught
the
dull
ear
of
the
dying
man
the
curate
saw
instantly
that
there
was
comprehension
in
the
flicker
of
the
eyelash
and
the
tremulous
movement
of
the
hand
upon
the
bed
it
was
a
new
and
unaccustomed
part
which
he
had
now
to
play
he
went
hurriedly
to
the
other
side
and
leaned
over
the
pillow
to
make
out
the
stammering
words
which
began
to
be
audible
lucy
had
risen
up
also
and
stood
looking
at
her
father
still
with
her
look
of
defence
as
the
feeble
lips
babbled
forth
unintelligible
words
lucy
face
grew
sterner
and
sterner
as
for
miss
wodehouse
she
stood
behind
crying
and
trembling
oh
mr
wentworth
do
you
think
it
is
returning
life
do
you
think
he
is
better
she
cried
looking
wistfully
at
the
curate
and
between
the
two
young
people
who
were
leaning
with
looks
and
feelings
so
different
over
his
bed
the
patient
lay
struggling
with
those
terrible
bonds
of
weakness
labouring
to
find
expression
for
something
which
wrought
him
into
a
fever
of
excitement
while
mr
wentworth
bent
his
ear
closer
and
closer
trying
to
make
some
sense
of
the
inarticulate
torrent
of
sound
lucy
inspired
by
grief
and
horror
and
indignation
leaned
over
her
father
on
the
other
side
doing
everything
possible
to
calm
him
oh
papa
do
say
any
more
say
any
more
we
understand
you
she
cried
and
put
her
soft
hands
upon
his
flushed
forehead
and
her
cheek
to
his
no
more
no
more
cried
the
girl
in
the
dulled
ear
which
could
not
hear
we
will
do
everything
you
wish
we
understand
all
said
lucy
mr
wentworth
withdrew
vanquished
in
that
strange
struggle
he
stood
looking
on
while
she
caressed
and
calmed
and
subdued
into
silence
the
dying
passion
which
he
would
have
given
anything
in
the
world
to
stimulate
into
clearer
utterance
she
had
baffled
his
efforts
made
him
helpless
to
serve
her
perhaps
injured
herself
cruelly
but
all
the
more
the
curate
loved
her
for
it
as
she
expanded
over
her
dying
father
with
the
white
sleeves
hanging
loose
about
her
arms
like
the
white
wings
of
an
angel
as
he
thought
gradually
the
agony
of
utterance
got
subdued
and
then
lucy
resumed
her
position
by
the
bed
he
shall
not
be
disturbed
she
said
again
through
lips
that
were
parched
with
emotion
and
so
sat
watchful
over
him
a
guardian
immovable
ready
to
defy
all
the
world
in
defence
of
his
peace
mr
wentworth
turned
away
with
his
heart
full
he
would
have
liked
to
go
and
kiss
her
hand
or
her
sleeve
or
anything
belonging
to
her
and
yet
he
was
impatient
beyond
expression
and
felt
that
she
had
baffled
and
vanquished
him
miss
wodehouse
stood
behind
still
looking
on
with
a
half
perception
of
what
had
happened
but
the
mind
of
the
elder
sister
was
occupied
with
vain
hopes
and
fears
such
as
inexperienced
people
are
subject
to
in
the
presence
of
death
he
heard
what
you
said
said
miss
wodehouse
do
you
think
that
was
a
good
sign
oh
mr
wentworth
sometimes
i
think
he
looks
a
little
better
said
the
poor
lady
looking
wistfully
into
the
curate
face
mr
wentworth
could
only
shake
his
head
as
he
hurried
away
i
must
go
and
consult
mr
waters
he
said
as
he
passed
her
i
shall
come
back
presently
and
then
miss
wodehouse
followed
him
to
the
door
to
beg
him
not
to
speak
to
mr
waters
of
for
papa
has
no
confidence
in
him
she
said
anxiously
the
curate
was
nearly
driven
to
his
wits
end
as
he
hastened
out
he
forgot
the
clouds
that
surrounded
him
in
his
anxiety
about
this
sad
household
for
it
seemed
but
too
evident
that
mr
wodehouse
had
made
no
special
provision
for
his
daughters
and
to
think
of
lucy
under
the
power
of
her
unknown
brother
made
mr
wentworth
blood
boil
the
shutters
were
all
put
up
that
afternoon
in
the
prettiest
house
in
grange
lane
the
event
took
carlingford
altogether
by
surprise
but
other
events
just
then
were
moving
the
town
into
the
wildest
excitement
for
nothing
could
be
heard
far
or
near
of
poor
little
rosa
elsworthy
and
everybody
was
aware
that
the
last
time
she
was
seen
in
carlingford
she
was
standing
by
herself
in
the
dark
at
mr
wentworth
chapter
xxviii
mrs
morgan
was
in
the
garden
watering
her
favourite
ferns
when
her
husband
returned
home
to
dinner
on
the
day
of
mr
wodehouse
death
the
rector
was
late
and
she
had
already
changed
her
dress
and
was
removing
the
withered
leaves
from
her
prettiest
plant
of
maidenhair
and
thinking
with
some
concern
of
the
fish
when
she
heard
his
step
on
the
gravel
for
the
cook
at
the
rectory
was
rather
hasty
in
her
temper
and
was
apt
to
be
provoking
to
her
mistress
next
morning
when
the
rector
chose
to
be
late
it
was
a
very
hot
day
and
mr
morgan
was
flushed
and
uncomfortable
to
see
his
wife
looking
so
cool
and
tranquil
in
her
muslin
dress
rather
aggravated
him
than
otherwise
for
she
did
not
betray
her
anxiety
about
the
trout
but
welcomed
him
with
a
smile
as
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
do
even
when
he
was
late
for
dinner
the
rector
looked
as
if
all
the
anxieties
of
the
world
were
on
his
shoulders
as
he
came
hurriedly
along
the
gravel
and
mrs
morgan
curiosity
was
sufficiently
excited
by
his
looks
to
have
overcome
any
consideration
but
that
of
the
trout
which
however
was
too
serious
to
be
trifled
with
so
instead
of
asking
questions
she
thought
it
wiser
simply
to
remind
her
husband
that
it
was
past
six
dinner
is
waiting
she
said
in
her
composed
way
and
the
rector
went
to
wash
his
hands
half
disposed
to
be
angry
with
his
wife
he
found
her
already
seated
at
the
head
of
the
table
when
he
came
down
after
his
rapid
ablutions
and
though
he
was
not
particularly
quick
of
perception
mr
morgan
perceived
by
the
looks
of
the
servant
as
well
as
the
mistress
that
he
was
generally
disapproved
of
throughout
the
household
for
being
half
an
hour
too
late
as
for
thomas
he
was
at
no
pains
to
conceal
his
sentiments
but
conducted
himself
with
distant
politeness
towards
his
master
expressing
the
feelings
of
the
household
with
all
the
greater
freedom
that
he
had
been
in
possession
of
the
rectory
since
mr
bury
time
and
felt
himself
more
secure
in
his
tenure
than
any
incumbent
as
was
natural
to
a
man
who
had
already
outlived
two
of
these
temporary
tenants
mr
morgan
was
disposed
to
be
conciliatory
when
he
saw
the
strength
of
the
opposite
side
i
am
a
little
late
today
said
the
politic
rector
mr
leeson
was
with
me
and
i
did
not
want
to
bring
him
home
to
dinner
it
was
only
on
wednesday
he
dined
with
us
and
i
know
you
do
care
for
chance
guests
i
think
it
shows
a
great
want
of
sense
in
mr
leeson
to
think
of
such
a
thing
said
mrs
morgan
responding
by
a
little
flush
of
anger
to
the
unlucky
curate
name
he
might
understand
that
people
like
to
be
by
themselves
now
and
then
i
am
surprised
that
you
give
in
to
him
so
much
as
you
do
william
must
stop
somewhere
and
i
think
it
is
always
best
to
draw
a
line
i
wish
it
were
possible
for
everybody
to
draw
a
line
said
the
rector
mysteriously
with
a
sigh
i
have
heard
something
that
has
grieved
me
very
much
i
will
tell
you
about
it
afterwards
when
he
had
said
this
mr
morgan
addressed
himself
sadly
to
his
dinner
sighing
over
it
as
if
that
had
something
to
do
with
his
distress
perhaps
suggested
thomas
who
was
scarcely
on
speaking
terms
with
his
master
the
rector
may
have
heard
as
mr
wodehouse
has
been
took
very
bad
again
and
aint
expected
to
see
out
the
night
i
am
very
sorry
said
the
rector
poor
ladies
it
will
come
very
hard
upon
them
my
dear
i
think
you
should
call
and
ask
if
you
can
do
anything
troubles
never
come
singly
it
is
said
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
poor
young
creature
though
perhaps
things
have
not
gone
so
far
as
one
imagined
the
rector
sighed
again
and
looked
as
though
his
secret
whatever
it
might
be
was
almost
too
much
for
him
the
consequence
of
course
was
that
thomas
prolonged
his
services
to
the
last
possibility
by
way
of
hearing
what
had
happened
as
for
mrs
morgan
she
sat
on
thorns
though
her
sense
of
propriety
was
too
great
to
permit
her
to
hurry
over
the
dinner
the
pudding
though
it
was
the
rector
favourite
pudding
prepared
from
a
receipt
only
known
at
in
which
the
late
respected
head
of
that
learned
community
had
concentrated
all
his
genius
was
eaten
in
uneasy
silence
broken
only
by
the
most
transparent
attempts
on
both
sides
to
make
a
little
conversation
thomas
hovered
sternly
over
his
master
and
mistress
all
the
time
exacting
with
inexorable
severity
every
usage
of
the
table
he
would
not
let
them
off
the
very
smallest
detail
but
insisted
on
handing
round
the
peaches
notwithstanding
mrs
morgan
protest
they
are
the
first
out
of
the
new
said
the
rector
wife
i
want
your
opinion
of
them
that
will
do
thomas
we
have
got
everything
now
i
think
mrs
morgan
was
a
little
anxious
about
the
peaches
having
made
a
great
many
changes
on
her
own
responsibility
in
the
gardening
department
but
the
rector
took
the
downy
fruit
as
if
it
had
been
a
turnip
and
notwithstanding
her
interest
in
the
news
his
wife
could
not
but
find
it
very
provoking
that
he
took
so
little
notice
of
her
exertions
roberts
stood
out
against
the
new
flue
as
long
as
he
could
said
mrs
morgan
mr
proctor
took
no
interest
in
the
garden
and
everything
had
gone
to
ruin
though
i
must
say
it
was
very
odd
that
anybody
from
college
william
should
be
careless
about
such
a
vital
matter
said
the
rector
wife
with
a
little
asperity
i
suppose
there
must
be
something
in
the
air
of
carlingford
which
makes
people
indifferent
naturally
it
was
very
provoking
after
all
the
trouble
she
had
taken
to
see
her
husband
slicing
that
juicy
pulp
as
if
it
had
been
any
ordinary
market
fruit
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
said
mr
morgan
i
was
thinking
of
this
story
about
mr
wentworth
one
is
always
making
new
discoveries
of
the
corruption
of
human
nature
he
had
behaved
very
badly
to
me
but
it
is
very
sad
to
see
a
young
man
sacrifice
all
his
prospects
for
the
indulgence
of
his
passions
though
that
is
a
very
secular
way
of
looking
at
the
subject
said
the
rector
shaking
his
head
mournfully
if
it
is
bad
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
what
is
it
in
a
spiritual
and
in
this
age
too
when
it
is
so
important
to
keep
up
the
character
of
the
clergy
mr
morgan
sighed
again
more
heavily
than
ever
as
he
poured
out
the
single
glass
of
port
in
which
his
wife
joined
him
after
dinner
such
an
occurrence
throws
a
stigma
upon
the
whole
church
as
mr
leeson
very
justly
remarked
i
thought
mr
leeson
must
have
something
to
do
with
it
said
the
rector
wife
what
has
mr
wentworth
been
doing
when
you
keep
a
curate
you
never
can
tell
what
he
may
say
if
he
had
known
of
the
pudding
he
would
have
come
to
dinner
and
we
should
have
had
it
at
said
mrs
morgan
severely
she
put
away
her
peach
in
her
resentment
and
went
to
a
for
her
work
which
she
always
kept
handy
for
emergencies
like
her
husband
mrs
morgan
had
acquired
some
little
ways
in
the
long
ten
years
of
their
engagement
one
of
which
was
a
confirmed
habit
of
needlework
at
all
kinds
of
unnecessary
moments
which
much
disturbed
the
rector
when
he
had
anything
particular
to
say
my
dear
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
you
so
much
the
victim
of
prejudice
said
mr
morgan
i
had
hoped
that
all
our
long
experiences
and
here
the
rector
stopped
short
troubled
to
see
the
rising
colour
in
his
wife
face
i
do
mean
to
blame
you
my
dear
said
the
perplexed
man
i
know
you
were
always
very
patient
and
he
paused
not
knowing
what
more
to
say
comforting
himself
with
the
thought
that
women
were
incomprehensible
creatures
as
so
many
men
have
done
before
i
am
not
patient
said
the
rector
wife
it
never
was
my
nature
i
ca
help
thinking
sometimes
that
our
long
experiences
have
done
us
more
harm
than
good
but
i
hope
nothing
will
ever
make
me
put
up
with
a
curate
who
tells
tales
about
other
people
and
flatters
one
self
and
comes
to
dinner
without
being
asked
perhaps
mr
wentworth
is
very
sinful
but
at
least
he
is
a
gentleman
said
mrs
morgan
and
she
bent
her
head
over
her
work
and
drove
her
needle
so
fast
through
the
muslin
she
was
at
work
upon
that
it
glimmered
and
sparkled
like
summer
lightning
before
the
spectator
dazzled
eyes
i
am
sorry
you
are
so
prejudiced
said
the
rector
it
is
a
very
unbecoming
spirit
my
dear
though
i
am
grieved
to
say
so
much
to
you
mr
leeson
is
a
very
good
young
man
and
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
terrible
story
about
mr
wentworth
i
do
wish
to
shock
your
feelings
but
there
are
a
great
many
things
in
the
world
that
one
ca
explain
to
ladies
he
has
got
himself
into
a
most
distressing
position
and
a
public
inquiry
will
be
necessary
one
ca
help
seeing
the
hand
of
providence
in
it
said
the
rector
playing
reflectively
with
the
peach
on
his
plate
it
was
at
this
moment
that
thomas
appeared
at
the
door
to
announce
mr
leeson
who
had
come
to
talk
over
the
topic
of
the
day
with
the
rector
being
comfortably
obtuse
in
his
perceptions
and
quite
disposed
to
ignore
mrs
morgan
general
demeanour
towards
himself
i
am
sure
she
has
a
bad
temper
he
would
say
to
his
confidants
in
the
parish
you
can
see
it
by
the
redness
in
her
face
but
i
never
take
any
notice
when
she
says
rude
things
to
me
the
redness
was
alarming
in
mrs
morgan
face
as
the
unlucky
man
became
visible
at
the
door
she
said
audibly
i
knew
we
should
be
interrupted
and
got
up
from
her
chair
as
mr
leeson
is
here
you
will
not
want
me
william
she
added
in
her
precisest
tones
if
anything
has
happened
since
you
came
in
he
will
be
able
to
tell
you
about
it
and
perhaps
i
had
better
send
you
your
coffee
here
for
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
do
mr
morgan
gave
a
little
groan
in
his
spirit
as
his
wife
went
away
to
do
him
justice
he
had
a
great
deal
of
confidence
in
her
and
was
unconsciously
guided
by
her
judgment
in
many
matters
talking
it
over
with
mr
leeson
was
a
totally
different
thing
for
whatever
might
be
said
in
his
defence
there
could
not
be
any
doubt
that
the
curate
professed
principles
and
had
been
known
to
drink
tea
with
mr
beecher
the
new
minister
of
salem
chapel
not
that
i
object
to
mr
beecher
because
he
is
a
dissenter
mr
morgan
said
but
because
my
dear
you
know
it
is
a
totally
different
class
of
society
when
the
rector
was
left
alone
to
discuss
parish
matters
with
this
doubtful
subordinate
instead
of
going
into
the
subject
with
his
wife
the
good
man
felt
a
pang
of
disappointment
for
though
he
professed
to
be
reluctant
to
shock
her
he
had
been
longing
all
the
time
to
enter
into
the
story
which
was
certainly
the
most
exciting
which
had
occurred
in
carlingford
since
the
beginning
of
his
incumbency
mrs
morgan
for
her
part
went
to
the
with
so
much
indignation
about
this
personal
grievance
that
she
almost
forgot
her
curiosity
mr
leeson
hung
like
a
cloud
over
all
the
advantages
of
carlingford
he
put
out
that
new
flue
in
the
greenhouse
upon
which
she
was
rather
disposed
to
pique
herself
and
withered
her
ferns
which
everybody
allowed
to
be
the
finest
collection
within
a
ten
miles
circuit
this
sense
of
disgust
increased
upon
her
as
she
went
into
the
where
her
eye
naturally
caught
that
carpet
which
had
been
the
first
cross
of
her
married
life
when
she
had
laid
down
her
work
she
began
to
plan
how
the
offensive
bouquets
might
be
covered
with
a
pinafore
of
linen
which
looked
very
cool
and
nice
in
and
then
the
rector
wife
reflected
that
in
winter
a
floor
covered
with
white
looked
chilly
and
that
a
woollen
drugget
of
an
appropriate
small
pattern
would
be
better
on
the
whole
but
no
such
thing
was
to
be
had
without
going
to
london
for
it
which
brought
her
mind
back
again
to
mr
leeson
and
all
the
disadvantages
of
carlingford
these
subjects
occupied
mrs
morgan
to
the
exclusion
of
external
matters
as
was
natural
and
when
she
heard
the
gentlemen
stir
as
if
with
ideas
of
joining
her
in
the
the
rector
wife
suddenly
recollected
that
she
had
promised
some
tea
to
a
poor
woman
in
grove
street
and
that
she
could
not
do
better
this
beautiful
evening
than
take
it
in
her
own
person
she
was
very
active
in
her
district
at
all
times
and
had
proved
herself
an
admirable
clergywoman
but
perhaps
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
her
to
go
out
upon
a
charitable
errand
that
particular
evening
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
of
mr
leeson
it
was
such
a
very
lovely
night
that
mrs
morgan
was
tempted
to
go
further
than
she
intended
she
called
on
two
or
three
of
her
favourites
in
grove
street
and
was
almost
as
friendly
with
them
as
lucy
wodehouse
was
with
the
people
in
prickett
lane
but
being
neither
pretty
and
young
like
lucy
nor
yet
a
mother
with
a
nursery
qualified
to
talk
about
the
measles
her
reception
was
not
quite
as
enthusiastic
as
it
might
have
been
somehow
it
would
appear
as
though
our
poor
neighbours
loved
most
the
ministrations
of
youth
which
is
superior
to
all
ranks
in
the
matter
of
possibility
and
expectation
and
inferior
to
all
ranks
in
the
matter
of
experience
and
so
holds
a
kind
of
balance
and
poise
of
nature
between
the
small
and
the
great
mrs
morgan
was
vaguely
sensible
of
her
disadvantages
in
this
respect
as
well
as
in
others
she
never
could
help
imagining
what
she
might
have
been
had
she
married
ten
years
before
at
the
natural
period
and
even
then
not
a
girl
she
said
to
herself
in
her
sensible
way
as
she
carried
this
habitual
thread
of
thought
with
her
along
the
street
past
the
little
front
gardens
where
there
were
so
many
mothers
with
their
children
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
the
genteel
houses
frowned
darkly
with
their
staircase
windows
upon
the
humility
of
grove
street
and
mrs
morgan
began
to
think
within
herself
of
the
miss
hemmings
and
other
spinsters
and
how
they
got
along
upon
this
path
of
life
which
after
all
is
never
lightsome
to
behold
except
in
the
future
or
the
past
it
was
dead
present
with
the
rector
wife
just
then
and
many
speculations
were
in
her
mind
as
was
natural
not
that
i
could
not
have
lived
unmarried
she
continued
within
herself
with
a
woman
pride
but
things
looked
so
different
at
and
in
her
heart
she
grudged
the
cares
she
had
lost
and
sighed
over
this
wasting
of
her
years
it
was
just
then
that
the
youngest
miss
hemmings
saw
mrs
morgan
and
crossed
over
to
speak
to
her
miss
hemmings
had
left
behind
a
long
time
ago
and
thought
the
rector
wife
a
happy
woman
in
the
bloom
of
youth
when
she
had
discovered
conclusively
that
mrs
morgan
would
not
go
in
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
miss
hemmings
volunteered
to
walk
with
her
to
the
corner
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
that
she
immediately
plunged
into
the
topic
which
at
that
moment
engaged
all
minds
in
carlingford
if
i
had
not
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
i
should
not
have
believed
it
said
miss
hemmings
i
should
have
thought
it
a
story
not
that
i
ever
could
have
thought
it
as
you
say
for
alas
i
know
well
that
without
grace
every
wickedness
is
more
than
possible
but
i
saw
them
with
my
own
eyes
my
dear
mrs
morgan
she
standing
outside
the
bold
little
thing
and
he
at
the
door
as
if
it
was
right
for
a
clergyman
to
open
the
door
like
a
and
from
that
moment
to
this
she
has
not
been
seen
by
any
living
creature
in
carlingford
who
can
tell
what
may
have
been
done
with
her
cried
the
horrified
eyewitness
she
has
never
been
seen
from
that
hour
but
that
was
only
hours
ago
said
mrs
morgan
she
may
have
gone
off
to
visit
some
of
her
friends
ah
my
dear
mrs
morgan
hours
is
a
long
time
for
a
girl
to
disappear
out
of
her
own
home
said
miss
hemmings
and
all
her
friends
have
been
sent
to
and
no
word
can
be
heard
of
her
i
am
afraid
it
will
go
very
hard
with
mr
wentworth
and
i
am
sure
it
looks
like
a
judgment
upon
him
for
all
his
candlesticks
and
flowers
and
things
she
continued
out
of
breath
with
the
impetuosity
of
her
tale
do
you
think
then
that
god
makes
people
sin
in
order
to
punish
them
said
mrs
morgan
with
some
fire
which
shocked
miss
hemmings
who
did
not
quite
know
how
to
reply
i
do
so
wish
you
would
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
and
taste
our
tea
my
sister
sophia
was
just
making
it
when
i
came
out
we
get
it
from
our
brother
in
assam
and
we
think
a
great
deal
of
it
said
miss
hemmings
it
ca
possibly
be
adulterated
you
know
for
it
comes
direct
from
his
plantation
if
you
ca
come
in
just
now
i
will
send
you
some
to
the
rectory
and
you
shall
tell
us
how
you
like
it
we
are
quite
proud
of
our
tea
my
brother
has
a
large
plantation
and
he
hopes
thank
you
said
mrs
morgan
but
the
rector
will
be
waiting
for
me
and
i
must
go
it
must
be
very
nice
to
have
your
tea
direct
from
the
plantation
and
i
hope
you
will
change
your
mind
about
mr
wentworth
she
continued
without
much
regard
for
punctuation
as
she
shook
hands
at
the
corner
mrs
morgan
went
down
a
narrow
street
which
led
to
grange
lane
after
this
interview
with
some
commotion
in
her
mind
she
took
mr
wentworth
part
instinctively
without
asking
any
proofs
of
his
innocence
the
sun
was
just
setting
and
st
roque
stood
out
dark
and
picturesque
against
all
the
glory
of
the
western
sky
as
the
rector
wife
went
past
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
him
in
his
youth
and
the
opening
of
his
career
with
a
kind
of
wistful
interest
if
he
had
married
lucy
wodehouse
and
confined
himself
to
his
own
district
but
then
he
had
no
district
mrs
morgan
would
have
contemplated
the
two
not
indeed
without
a
certain
and
contrast
but
with
natural
sympathy
and
now
to
think
of
this
dark
and
ugly
blot
on
his
fair
beginning
disturbed
her
much
when
mrs
morgan
recollected
that
she
had
left
her
husband
and
his
curate
consulting
over
this
matter
she
grew
very
hot
and
angry
and
felt
humiliated
by
the
thought
was
it
her
william
her
hero
whom
she
had
magnified
for
all
these
ten
years
though
not
without
occasional
twinges
of
enlightenment
into
something
great
who
was
thus
sitting
upon
his
young
brother
with
so
little
human
feeling
and
so
much
jealousy
it
hurt
her
to
think
of
it
though
not
for
mr
wentworth
sake
poor
mrs
morgan
though
not
at
all
a
sentimental
person
had
hoarded
up
her
ideal
so
much
after
the
ordinary
date
that
it
came
all
the
harder
upon
her
when
everything
thus
merged
into
the
light
of
common
day
she
walked
very
fast
up
grange
lane
which
was
another
habit
of
her
maidenhood
not
quite
in
accord
with
the
habit
of
sauntering
acquired
during
the
same
period
by
the
fellow
of
when
mrs
morgan
was
opposite
mr
wodehouse
she
looked
across
with
some
interest
thinking
of
lucy
and
it
shocked
her
greatly
to
see
the
closed
shutters
which
told
of
the
presence
of
death
then
a
little
farther
up
she
could
see
elsworthy
in
front
of
his
shop
which
was
already
closed
talking
vehemently
to
a
little
group
round
the
door
the
rector
wife
crossed
the
street
to
avoid
coming
into
contact
with
this
excited
party
and
as
she
went
swiftly
along
under
the
came
direct
without
perceiving
it
upon
mr
wentworth
who
was
going
the
opposite
way
they
were
both
absorbed
in
their
own
thoughts
the
perpetual
curate
only
perceiving
mrs
morgan
in
time
to
take
off
his
hat
to
her
as
he
passed
and
to
tell
the
truth
having
no
desire
for
any
further
intercourse
mrs
morgan
however
was
of
a
different
mind
she
stopped
instantly
as
soon
as
she
perceived
him
mr
wentworth
it
is
getting
late
will
you
walk
with
me
as
far
as
the
rectory
she
said
to
the
curate
great
astonishment
he
could
not
help
looking
at
her
with
curiosity
as
he
turned
to
accompany
her
mrs
morgan
was
still
wearing
her
wedding
things
which
were
not
now
in
their
first
freshness
not
to
say
that
the
redness
of
which
she
was
so
painfully
sensible
was
rather
out
of
accordance
with
the
orange
blossoms
then
she
was
rather
flurried
and
disturbed
in
her
mind
and
on
the
whole
mr
wentworth
ungratefully
concluded
the
rector
wife
to
be
looking
her
plainest
as
he
turned
with
very
languid
interest
to
see
her
safely
home
a
great
many
things
seem
to
be
happening
just
now
said
mrs
morgan
with
a
good
deal
of
embarrassment
i
suppose
the
people
in
carlingford
are
grateful
to
anybody
who
gives
them
something
to
talk
about
i
do
know
about
the
gratitude
said
the
perpetual
curate
it
is
a
sentiment
i
do
believe
in
you
ought
to
believe
in
everything
as
long
as
you
are
young
said
mrs
morgan
i
want
very
much
to
speak
to
you
mr
wentworth
but
then
i
do
know
how
you
will
receive
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
ca
tell
until
i
know
what
it
is
said
the
curate
shutting
himself
up
he
had
an
expressive
face
generally
and
mrs
morgan
saw
the
shutters
put
up
and
the
jealous
blinds
drawn
over
the
young
countenance
as
clearly
as
if
they
had
been
tangible
articles
he
did
not
look
at
her
but
kept
swinging
his
cane
in
his
hand
and
regarding
the
pavement
with
downcast
eyes
and
if
the
rector
wife
had
formed
any
expectations
of
finding
in
the
perpetual
curate
an
ingenuous
young
heart
open
to
sympathy
and
criticism
she
now
discovered
her
mistake
if
i
run
the
risk
perhaps
you
will
forgive
me
said
mrs
morgan
i
have
just
been
hearing
a
dreadful
story
about
you
and
i
do
believe
it
in
the
least
mr
wentworth
she
continued
with
a
little
effusion
for
though
she
was
very
sensible
she
was
only
a
woman
and
did
not
realise
the
possibility
of
having
her
sympathy
rejected
and
her
favourable
judgment
received
with
indifference
i
am
much
flattered
by
your
good
opinion
what
was
the
dreadful
story
asked
mr
wentworth
looking
at
her
with
careless
eyes
they
were
just
opposite
elsworthy
shop
and
could
almost
hear
what
he
was
saying
as
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
his
little
group
of
listeners
talking
loud
and
vehemently
the
perpetual
curate
looked
calmly
at
him
across
the
road
and
turned
again
to
mrs
morgan
repeating
his
question
what
was
the
dreadful
story
one
gets
used
to
romances
he
said
with
a
composure
too
elaborate
to
be
real
but
mrs
morgan
did
not
think
of
that
if
you
do
care
about
it
i
need
not
say
anything
said
the
rector
wife
who
could
not
help
feeling
affronted
but
i
am
so
sorry
that
mr
morgan
and
you
do
get
on
she
continued
after
a
little
pause
i
have
no
right
to
speak
but
i
take
an
interest
in
everything
that
belongs
to
the
parish
if
you
would
put
a
little
confidence
in
my
husband
things
might
go
on
better
but
in
the
mean
time
i
thought
i
might
say
to
you
on
my
own
account
that
i
had
heard
this
scandal
and
that
i
do
believe
in
it
if
you
do
not
understand
my
motive
i
ca
help
it
said
the
rector
wife
who
was
now
equally
ready
for
friendship
or
for
battle
thanks
i
understand
what
you
mean
said
mr
wentworth
who
had
come
to
himself
but
will
you
tell
me
what
it
is
you
do
believe
in
he
asked
with
a
smile
which
mrs
morgan
did
not
quite
comprehend
i
will
tell
you
she
said
with
a
little
quiet
exasperation
i
do
think
you
would
risk
your
prospects
and
get
yourself
into
trouble
and
damage
your
entire
life
for
the
sake
of
any
girl
however
pretty
she
might
be
men
do
do
such
things
for
women
nowadays
even
when
it
is
a
worthy
object
said
the
disappointed
optimist
and
i
believe
you
are
a
great
deal
more
sensible
mr
wentworth
there
was
just
that
tone
of
mingled
approval
and
contempt
in
this
speech
which
a
woman
knows
how
to
deliver
herself
of
without
any
appearance
of
feeling
and
which
no
young
man
however
can
hear
with
composure
perhaps
not
he
said
with
a
little
heat
and
a
rising
colour
i
am
glad
you
think
me
so
sensible
and
then
there
ensued
a
pause
upon
the
issue
of
which
depended
the
question
of
peace
or
war
between
these
two
mr
wentworth
good
angel
perhaps
dropped
softly
through
the
dusky
air
at
that
moment
and
jogged
his
perverse
charge
with
the
tip
of
a
celestial
wing
and
yet
there
might
be
women
in
the
world
for
whom
said
the
curate
and
stopped
again
i
daresay
you
are
not
anxious
to
know
my
sentiments
on
the
subject
he
continued
with
a
little
laugh
i
am
sorry
you
think
so
badly
i
mean
so
well
of
me
i
do
think
badly
of
you
said
mrs
morgan
hastily
thank
you
for
walking
with
me
and
whatever
happens
remember
that
i
for
one
believe
a
word
of
it
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
after
this
little
declaration
of
friendship
the
rector
wife
returned
to
the
rectory
where
her
husband
was
waiting
for
her
more
than
ever
prepared
to
stand
up
for
mr
wentworth
she
went
back
to
the
forgetting
all
about
the
carpet
and
poured
out
the
tea
with
satisfaction
and
made
herself
very
agreeable
to
mr
finial
the
architect
who
had
come
to
talk
over
the
restorations
in
that
moment
of
stimulation
she
forgot
all
her
experience
of
her
husband
puzzled
looks
of
the
with
which
he
looked
at
her
and
the
depths
of
stubborn
determination
which
were
far
beyond
the
reach
of
her
hastier
and
more
generous
spirit
and
so
went
on
with
more
satisfaction
and
gaiety
than
she
had
felt
possible
for
a
long
time
beating
her
drums
and
blowing
her
trumpets
to
the
encounter
in
which
her
female
forces
were
so
confident
of
victory
chapter
xxix
mr
wentworth
went
upon
his
way
after
he
had
parted
from
mrs
morgan
with
a
moment
gratitude
but
he
had
not
gone
steps
before
that
amiable
sentiment
yielded
to
a
sense
of
soreness
and
vexation
he
had
almost
acknowledged
that
he
was
conscious
of
the
slander
against
which
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
present
a
blank
front
of
unconsciousness
and
passive
resistance
and
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
his
susceptibility
to
this
unexpected
voice
of
kindness
he
was
going
home
but
he
did
not
care
for
going
home
poor
mrs
hadwin
anxious
looks
of
suspicion
had
added
to
the
distaste
with
which
he
thought
of
encountering
again
the
sullen
shabby
rascal
to
whom
he
had
given
shelter
it
was
saturday
night
and
he
had
still
his
sermon
to
prepare
for
the
next
day
but
the
young
man
was
in
a
state
of
disgust
with
all
the
circumstances
of
his
lot
and
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
go
in
and
address
himself
to
his
work
as
he
ought
to
have
done
such
a
sense
of
injustice
and
cruelty
as
possessed
him
was
not
likely
to
promote
composition
especially
as
the
pulpit
addresses
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
were
not
of
a
declamatory
kind
to
think
that
so
many
years
work
could
be
neutralised
in
a
day
by
a
sudden
breath
of
scandal
made
him
not
humble
or
patient
but
fierce
and
resentful
he
had
been
in
wharfside
that
afternoon
and
felt
convinced
that
even
the
dying
woman
at
no
prickett
lane
had
heard
of
rosa
elsworthy
and
he
saw
or
imagined
he
saw
many
a
distrustful
inquiring
glance
thrown
at
him
by
people
to
whom
he
had
been
a
kind
of
secondary
providence
naturally
the
mere
thought
of
the
failing
allegiance
of
the
district
went
to
mr
wentworth
heart
when
he
turned
round
suddenly
from
listening
to
a
long
account
of
one
poor
family
distresses
and
saw
tom
burrows
the
gigantic
bargeman
whose
six
children
the
curate
had
baptised
in
a
lump
and
whose
baby
had
been
held
at
the
font
by
lucy
wodehouse
herself
looking
at
him
wistfully
with
rude
affection
and
something
that
looked
very
much
like
pity
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
bitterness
that
welled
up
in
the
mind
of
the
perpetual
curate
instead
of
leaving
wharfside
comforted
as
he
usually
did
he
came
away
wounded
and
angry
feeling
to
its
full
extent
the
fickleness
of
popular
sympathy
and
when
he
came
into
grange
lane
and
saw
the
shutters
closed
and
mr
green
door
shut
fast
as
if
never
more
to
open
all
sources
of
consolation
seemed
to
be
shut
against
him
even
the
habit
he
had
of
going
into
elsworthy
to
get
his
newspaper
and
to
hear
what
talk
might
be
current
in
carlingford
contributed
to
the
sense
of
utter
discomfort
and
wretchedness
which
overwhelmed
him
men
in
other
positions
have
generally
to
consult
the
opinion
of
their
equals
only
but
all
sorts
of
small
people
can
plant
thorns
in
the
path
of
a
priest
who
has
given
himself
with
fervour
to
the
duties
of
his
office
true
enough
such
clouds
blow
by
and
sometimes
leave
behind
a
sky
clearer
than
before
but
that
result
is
doubtful
and
mr
wentworth
was
not
of
the
temper
to
comfort
himself
with
philosophy
he
felt
ingratitude
keenly
as
men
do
at
even
when
they
have
made
up
their
minds
that
gratitude
is
a
delusion
and
still
more
keenly
with
deep
resentment
and
indignation
he
felt
the
horrible
doubt
which
had
diffused
itself
around
him
and
seemed
to
be
looking
at
him
out
of
everybody
eyes
in
such
a
state
of
mind
one
bethinks
one
self
of
one
relations
those
friends
not
always
congenial
but
whom
one
looks
to
instinctively
when
one
is
young
in
the
crisis
of
life
he
knocked
at
his
aunts
door
almost
without
knowing
it
as
he
went
down
grange
lane
after
leaving
mrs
morgan
with
vague
sentences
of
his
sermon
floating
in
his
mind
through
all
the
imbroglio
of
other
thoughts
even
aunt
dora
foolish
affection
might
have
been
a
little
comfort
at
the
moment
and
he
could
not
but
be
a
little
curious
to
know
whether
they
had
heard
elsworthy
story
and
what
the
patronesses
of
skelmersdale
thought
of
the
matter
somehow
just
then
in
the
midst
of
his
distresses
a
vision
of
skelmersdale
burst
upon
the
perpetual
curate
like
a
glimpse
of
a
better
world
if
he
could
but
escape
there
out
of
all
this
sickening
misconception
and
ingratitude
if
he
could
but
take
lucy
into
his
protecting
arms
and
carry
her
away
far
from
the
clouds
that
were
gathering
over
her
path
as
well
as
his
own
the
thought
found
vent
in
an
impatient
sigh
and
was
then
expelled
contemptuously
from
the
young
man
bosom
if
a
hundred
skelmersdales
were
in
his
power
here
where
his
honour
had
been
attacked
it
was
necessary
to
remain
in
the
face
of
all
obstacles
till
it
was
cleared
the
miss
wentworths
had
just
come
up
to
the
after
dinner
when
their
nephew
entered
as
for
miss
dora
she
had
seated
herself
by
the
window
which
was
open
and
with
her
light
little
curls
fluttering
upon
her
cheek
was
watching
a
tiny
puff
of
smoke
by
the
side
of
the
great
laurel
which
indicated
the
spot
occupied
at
this
moment
by
jack
and
his
cigar
dear
fellow
he
does
enjoy
the
quiet
she
said
with
a
suppressed
little
sniff
of
emotion
to
think
we
should
be
in
such
a
misery
about
poor
dear
frank
and
have
jack
about
whom
we
have
all
been
so
unbelieving
sent
to
us
for
a
consolation
my
poor
brother
will
be
so
happy
said
miss
dora
almost
crying
at
the
thought
she
was
under
the
influence
of
this
sentiment
when
the
curate
entered
it
was
perhaps
impossible
for
mr
wentworth
to
present
himself
before
his
three
aunts
at
the
present
crisis
without
a
certain
consciousness
in
his
looks
and
it
was
well
that
it
was
twilight
and
he
could
not
read
distinctly
all
that
was
written
in
their
countenances
miss
cecilia
held
out
her
lovely
old
hand
to
him
first
of
all
she
said
how
do
you
do
frank
which
was
not
very
original
but
yet
counted
for
a
good
deal
in
the
silence
when
he
came
up
to
her
she
offered
him
her
sweet
old
cheek
with
a
look
of
pity
which
touched
and
yet
affronted
the
perpetual
curate
he
thought
it
was
the
wisest
way
to
accept
the
challenge
at
once
it
is
very
good
of
you
but
you
need
not
be
sorry
for
me
he
said
as
he
sat
down
by
her
and
then
there
was
a
little
pause
an
awful
pause
for
miss
wentworth
had
no
further
observations
to
offer
and
miss
dora
who
had
risen
up
hastily
dropped
into
her
chair
again
in
a
disconsolate
condition
when
she
saw
that
her
nephew
did
not
take
any
notice
of
her
the
poor
little
woman
sat
down
with
miserable
sensations
and
did
not
find
the
comfort
she
hoped
for
in
contemplation
of
the
smoke
of
cigar
after
all
it
was
frank
who
was
the
original
owner
of
miss
affections
when
she
saw
him
as
she
thought
in
a
state
of
guilt
and
trouble
received
with
grim
silence
by
the
dreaded
leonora
the
poor
lady
began
to
waver
greatly
divided
between
a
longing
to
return
to
her
old
allegiance
and
a
certain
pride
in
the
new
bonds
which
bound
her
to
so
great
a
sinner
as
jack
she
could
not
help
feeling
the
distinction
of
having
such
a
reprobate
in
her
hands
but
the
sight
of
frank
brought
back
old
habits
and
miss
dora
felt
at
her
wits
end
and
could
not
tell
what
to
do
at
length
miss
leonora
voice
which
was
decided
contralto
broke
the
silence
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
frank
said
the
aunt
from
something
we
heard
i
supposed
you
had
gone
away
for
a
time
and
we
were
rather
anxious
about
your
movements
there
are
so
many
things
going
on
in
the
family
just
now
that
one
does
not
know
what
to
think
i
am
glad
to
see
you
are
still
in
carlingford
i
never
had
the
least
intention
of
going
away
said
mr
wentworth
i
ca
imagine
who
could
tell
you
so
nobody
told
us
said
miss
leonora
we
drew
that
conclusion
from
other
things
we
heard
dora
give
frank
the
newspaper
with
that
paragraph
about
gerald
i
have
prophesied
from
the
very
first
which
way
gerald
was
tending
it
is
very
shocking
of
him
and
i
do
know
what
they
are
to
do
for
louisa
is
an
expensive
little
fool
and
if
he
leaves
the
rectory
they
ca
have
enough
to
live
on
if
you
knew
what
your
brother
was
going
to
do
why
did
you
advise
him
otherwise
besides
he
will
be
wretched
said
the
discriminating
woman
i
never
approved
of
his
ways
but
i
could
not
say
anything
against
his
sincerity
i
believe
his
heart
was
in
his
work
a
man
may
be
very
zealous
and
yet
very
erroneous
said
miss
leonora
like
an
oracle
out
of
the
shadows
i
do
know
if
he
is
erroneous
or
not
but
i
know
i
should
like
to
punch
this
man
head
said
the
curate
who
had
taken
the
paper
to
the
window
where
there
was
just
light
enough
to
make
out
the
paragraph
he
stood
looming
over
miss
dora
a
great
black
shadow
against
the
fading
light
all
the
mischief
in
the
world
comes
of
these
villanous
papers
said
mr
wentworth
though
i
did
not
think
anybody
nowadays
believed
in
the
gerald
has
not
gone
over
to
rome
and
i
do
think
he
means
to
go
i
daresay
you
have
agitated
yourselves
unnecessarily
about
more
than
one
supposed
event
in
the
family
he
continued
throwing
the
paper
on
the
table
i
do
know
anything
very
alarming
that
has
happened
as
yet
except
perhaps
the
prodigal
return
said
the
perpetual
curate
with
a
slight
touch
of
bitterness
his
eye
had
just
lighted
on
jack
sauntering
through
the
garden
with
his
cigar
and
mr
wentworth
was
human
and
could
not
entirely
refrain
from
the
expression
of
his
sentiments
but
oh
frank
my
dear
you
are
not
angry
about
poor
jack
said
miss
dora
he
has
not
known
what
it
was
to
be
at
home
for
years
and
years
a
stepmother
is
so
different
from
an
own
mother
and
he
never
has
had
any
opportunities
and
oh
frank
do
you
remember
that
there
is
joy
in
heaven
cried
the
anxious
aunt
not
to
say
that
he
is
the
eldest
son
and
it
is
such
a
thing
for
the
family
to
see
him
changing
his
ways
in
such
a
beautiful
spirit
said
miss
dora
the
room
was
almost
dark
by
this
time
and
she
did
not
see
that
her
penitent
had
entered
while
she
spoke
it
is
very
consoling
to
gain
your
approval
aunt
dora
said
jack
my
brother
frank
does
know
me
if
the
squire
make
a
nursery
of
his
house
what
can
a
man
do
but
a
fellow
ca
be
quite
ruined
as
long
as
he
has
aunts
the
reprobate
was
about
to
say
with
an
inflection
of
laughter
intended
for
frank
ear
only
in
his
voice
but
he
fortunately
remembered
in
time
that
miss
leonora
had
an
acute
intelligence
and
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
as
long
as
he
has
female
relations
said
jack
in
his
most
feeling
tone
men
never
sympathise
with
men
he
seemed
to
be
apologising
for
frank
indifference
as
well
as
for
his
own
sins
he
had
just
had
a
very
good
dinner
for
the
miss
wentworths
cook
was
the
best
in
carlingford
and
jack
whose
digestion
was
perfect
was
disposed
to
please
everybody
and
had
in
particular
no
disposition
to
quarrel
with
frank
oh
my
dear
you
see
how
humble
and
forgiving
he
is
said
miss
dora
rising
on
tiptoe
to
whisper
into
the
curate
ear
and
always
takes
your
part
whenever
you
are
mentioned
said
the
injudicious
aunt
meantime
the
other
sisters
were
very
silent
sitting
each
in
the
midst
of
her
own
group
of
shadows
then
miss
leonora
rose
with
a
sudden
rustling
of
all
her
draperies
and
with
her
own
energetic
hand
rang
the
bell
now
the
lamp
is
coming
said
jack
in
a
tone
of
despair
a
bright
blank
pitiless
globe
like
the
world
and
instead
of
this
delicious
darkness
where
one
can
see
nothing
distinctly
my
heart
will
be
torn
asunder
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
by
the
sight
of
suicide
why
do
we
ever
have
lights
said
the
exquisite
laying
himself
down
softly
on
a
sofa
when
the
lamp
was
brought
in
jack
became
visible
stretched
out
in
an
attitude
of
perfect
repose
and
tranquillity
with
a
quiet
conscience
written
in
every
fold
of
his
scrupulous
apparel
as
for
frank
on
the
contrary
he
was
still
in
morning
dress
and
was
biting
his
nails
and
had
a
cloud
upon
his
brow
which
the
sudden
light
disclosed
like
a
traitor
before
he
was
prepared
for
it
between
the
two
brothers
such
a
contrast
was
visible
that
it
was
not
surprising
if
miss
dora
still
wavering
in
her
allegiance
went
back
with
relief
to
the
calm
countenance
of
her
penitent
and
owned
to
herself
with
trembling
that
the
curate
looked
preoccupied
and
guilty
perhaps
miss
leonora
came
to
a
similar
conclusion
she
seated
herself
at
her
with
her
usual
air
of
business
and
made
a
pen
to
a
hard
point
by
the
light
of
the
candles
which
were
sacred
to
her
particular
use
i
heard
some
news
this
morning
which
pleased
me
very
much
said
miss
leonora
i
daresay
you
remember
julia
trench
you
two
used
to
be
a
great
deal
together
at
one
time
she
is
going
to
be
married
to
mr
shirley
excellent
curate
who
is
a
young
man
of
the
highest
character
he
did
very
well
at
the
university
i
believe
said
the
patroness
of
skelmersdale
but
i
confess
i
do
care
much
for
academical
honours
he
is
an
excellent
clergyman
which
is
a
great
deal
more
to
the
purpose
and
i
thoroughly
agree
with
his
views
so
knowing
the
interest
we
take
in
julia
you
may
think
how
pleased
we
were
said
miss
leonora
looking
full
into
her
nephew
face
he
knew
what
she
meant
as
distinctly
as
if
she
had
put
it
in
words
when
is
old
shirley
going
to
die
said
jack
from
the
sofa
rather
hard
upon
frank
keeping
him
out
of
the
living
so
long
and
if
i
were
you
i
be
jealous
of
this
model
curate
said
the
fine
gentleman
with
a
slight
civil
yawn
i
do
approve
of
model
curates
upon
family
livings
people
are
apt
to
make
comparisons
said
jack
and
then
he
raised
his
head
with
a
little
energy
ah
there
it
is
said
the
sybarite
the
first
moth
do
be
precipitate
my
dear
fellow
aunt
dora
pray
sit
quietly
where
you
are
and
do
disturb
our
operations
it
is
only
a
moth
to
be
sure
but
do
let
us
cut
short
the
moments
of
a
creature
that
has
no
hereafter
said
jack
solemnly
he
disturbed
them
all
by
this
eccentric
manifestation
of
benevolence
and
flapped
his
handkerchief
round
miss
dora
upon
whose
white
cap
the
unlucky
moth
frightened
by
its
benefactor
vehemence
was
fluttering
wildly
jack
even
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
swear
softly
in
french
at
the
frightened
insect
as
it
flew
wildly
off
at
a
tangent
not
to
the
open
window
but
to
miss
leonora
candles
where
it
came
to
an
immediate
end
miss
leonora
sat
rather
grimly
looking
on
at
all
this
byplay
when
her
elegant
nephew
threw
himself
back
once
more
upon
his
sofa
she
glanced
from
him
to
his
brother
with
a
comparison
which
perhaps
was
not
so
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
perpetual
curate
but
even
miss
leonora
though
so
sensible
had
her
weaknesses
and
she
was
very
evangelical
and
could
put
up
with
a
great
deal
from
the
sinner
who
had
placed
himself
for
conversion
in
her
hands
we
have
too
great
a
sense
of
our
responsibility
to
treat
skelmersdale
simply
as
a
family
living
she
said
besides
frank
of
course
is
to
have
wentworth
rectory
gerald
perversion
is
a
great
blow
but
still
if
it
to
be
frank
will
be
provided
for
at
least
as
for
our
parish
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
curate
i
have
not
the
least
intention
of
leaving
carlingford
at
the
present
moment
neither
skelmersdale
nor
wentworth
would
tempt
me
i
am
in
no
doubt
as
to
where
my
work
lies
and
there
is
enough
of
it
to
satisfy
any
man
he
could
not
help
thinking
as
he
spoke
of
ungrateful
wharfside
for
which
he
had
done
so
much
and
the
recollection
brought
a
little
flush
of
indignant
colour
to
his
cheek
oh
frank
my
dear
said
miss
dora
in
a
whisper
stealing
up
to
him
if
it
is
not
true
you
must
not
mind
oh
my
dear
boy
nobody
will
mind
it
if
it
is
not
true
she
put
her
hand
timidly
upon
his
arm
as
she
reached
up
to
his
ear
and
at
the
same
time
the
poor
little
woman
who
was
trying
all
she
could
to
serve
two
masters
kept
one
eye
upon
jack
lest
her
momentary
return
to
his
brother
might
have
a
disastrous
effect
upon
the
moral
reformation
which
she
was
nursing
with
so
much
care
as
for
the
curate
he
gave
her
a
hasty
glance
which
very
nearly
made
an
end
of
miss
dora
she
retired
to
her
seat
with
no
more
courage
to
say
anything
unable
to
make
out
whether
it
was
virtuous
reproach
or
angry
guilt
which
looked
at
her
so
sternly
she
felt
her
headache
coming
on
as
she
sank
again
upon
her
chair
if
she
could
but
have
stolen
away
to
her
own
room
and
had
a
good
comforting
cry
in
the
dark
it
might
have
kept
off
the
headache
but
then
she
had
to
be
faithful
to
her
post
and
to
look
after
the
reformation
of
jack
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
great
work
might
be
done
in
carlingford
said
miss
leonora
if
you
would
take
my
advice
and
organise
matters
properly
and
make
due
provision
for
the
lay
element
as
for
sisters
of
mercy
i
never
had
any
belief
in
them
they
only
get
young
clergymen
into
mischief
said
the
aunt
we
are
going
to
have
tea
frank
if
you
will
have
some
poor
mr
shirley
has
got
matters
into
very
bad
order
at
skelmersdale
but
things
will
be
different
under
the
new
incumbent
i
hope
said
miss
leonora
shooting
a
of
keen
inspection
at
the
curate
who
bore
it
steadily
i
hope
he
will
conduct
himself
to
your
satisfaction
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
bland
but
somewhat
grim
aspect
from
the
window
but
i
ca
wait
for
tea
i
have
still
got
some
of
my
work
to
do
for
so
i
walk
with
you
frank
said
his
elder
brother
my
dear
aunts
do
look
alarmed
nothing
can
happen
to
me
there
are
few
temptations
in
grange
lane
and
besides
i
shall
come
back
directly
can
not
do
without
my
tea
said
jack
by
way
of
consoling
poor
miss
dora
who
had
started
with
consternation
at
the
proposal
and
the
two
brothers
went
out
into
the
fresh
evening
air
together
their
aunt
dora
watching
them
from
the
window
with
inexpressible
anxiety
for
perhaps
it
was
not
quite
right
for
a
clergyman
to
saunter
out
of
doors
in
the
evening
with
such
a
doubtful
member
of
society
as
jack
and
perhaps
frank
having
himself
fallen
into
evil
ways
might
hinder
or
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
of
his
brother
in
the
practice
of
all
the
virtues
miss
dora
who
had
to
carry
them
both
upon
her
shoulders
and
who
got
no
sympathy
in
the
present
case
from
her
sisters
was
fain
at
last
to
throw
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
steal
out
to
that
which
was
built
into
the
and
commanded
grange
lane
from
its
little
window
there
she
established
herself
in
the
darkness
an
affectionate
spy
there
ought
to
have
been
a
moon
that
night
and
accordingly
the
lamps
were
not
lighted
at
that
end
of
grange
lane
for
the
authorities
in
carlingford
bore
a
frugal
mind
but
the
sky
had
become
cloudy
and
the
moon
shone
only
at
intervals
which
gave
a
certain
character
of
mystery
and
secrecy
to
the
night
through
this
uncertain
light
the
anxious
woman
saw
her
two
nephews
coming
and
going
under
the
window
apparently
in
the
most
eager
conversation
miss
dora
anxiety
grew
to
such
a
height
that
she
opened
softly
a
chink
of
the
window
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
hear
as
well
as
to
see
but
that
attempt
was
altogether
unsuccessful
then
when
they
had
walked
about
for
half
an
hour
which
looked
like
two
hours
to
miss
dora
who
was
rapidly
taking
one
of
her
bad
colds
at
the
window
they
were
joined
by
another
figure
which
she
did
not
think
she
had
ever
seen
before
the
excitement
was
growing
tremendous
and
the
aspect
of
the
three
conspirators
more
and
more
alarming
when
the
poor
lady
started
with
a
little
scream
at
a
noise
behind
her
and
turning
round
saw
her
maid
severe
as
a
pursuing
fate
standing
at
the
door
after
giving
me
your
word
as
you
would
come
no
more
said
the
reproachful
despot
who
swayed
miss
dora
soul
after
that
she
had
to
make
the
best
of
her
way
indoors
thankful
not
to
be
carried
to
her
room
and
put
into
hot
water
which
was
the
original
intention
of
collins
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
emotions
of
miss
dora
mind
after
this
glimpse
into
the
heart
of
the
volcano
on
which
her
innocent
feet
were
standing
unless
it
were
murder
or
high
treason
what
could
they
have
to
plot
about
or
was
the
mysterious
stranger
a
disguised
jesuit
and
the
whole
business
some
terrible
papist
conspiracy
jack
who
had
been
so
much
abroad
and
gerald
who
was
going
over
to
rome
and
frank
who
was
in
trouble
of
every
description
got
entangled
together
in
miss
dora
disturbed
imagination
no
reality
could
be
so
frightful
as
the
fancies
with
which
she
distracted
herself
after
that
peep
from
the
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
indignation
of
collins
who
knew
that
her
mistress
would
kill
herself
some
day
and
was
aware
that
she
in
her
own
person
would
get
little
rest
that
night
chapter
xxx
i
do
know
what
is
the
exact
connection
between
tea
and
reformation
said
jack
wentworth
with
a
wonderful
yawn
when
i
consider
that
this
is
all
on
account
of
that
stupid
beast
wodehouse
i
feel
disposed
to
eat
him
by
the
way
they
have
got
a
capital
cook
i
did
not
think
such
a
was
the
sort
of
thing
to
be
found
in
the
bosom
of
one
family
which
has
meant
boiled
mutton
up
to
this
moment
to
my
uninstructed
imagination
but
the
old
ladies
are
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
i
presume
is
unusual
to
them
it
appears
you
have
been
getting
into
scrapes
like
other
people
though
you
are
a
parson
as
your
elder
brother
my
dear
frank
look
here
said
the
perpetual
curate
you
want
to
ask
about
wodehouse
i
will
answer
your
questions
since
you
seem
to
have
some
interest
in
him
but
i
do
speak
of
my
private
affairs
to
any
but
my
intimate
friends
said
mr
wentworth
who
was
not
in
a
humour
to
be
trifled
with
the
elder
brother
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
curious
to
remark
the
progress
of
the
younger
members
of
one
family
he
said
reflectively
when
you
were
a
little
boy
you
took
your
drubbings
dutifully
but
never
mind
we
another
subject
in
hand
i
take
an
interest
in
wodehouse
and
so
do
you
i
ca
tell
for
what
reason
perhaps
he
is
one
of
the
intimate
friends
with
whom
you
discuss
your
private
affairs
but
that
is
a
matter
quite
apart
from
the
subject
the
thing
is
that
he
has
to
be
taken
care
of
not
for
his
own
sake
as
i
do
need
to
explain
to
you
said
jack
i
hear
the
old
fellow
died
today
which
was
the
best
thing
he
could
have
done
upon
the
whole
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
how
much
he
had
and
how
he
has
left
it
we
may
have
to
take
different
sides
and
the
fellow
himself
is
a
snob
but
i
should
like
to
understand
exactly
the
state
of
affairs
between
you
and
me
as
gentlemen
said
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
either
a
passing
spasm
of
compunction
passed
over
him
as
he
said
the
word
or
it
was
the
moon
which
had
just
flung
aside
the
last
fold
of
cloud
and
burst
out
upon
them
as
they
turned
back
facing
her
when
we
know
how
the
affair
stands
we
can
either
negotiate
or
fight
he
added
puffing
a
volume
of
smoke
from
his
cigar
really
a
very
fine
effect
that
little
church
of
yours
comes
well
against
that
bit
of
sky
it
looks
like
a
constable
or
rather
it
would
look
like
a
constable
thrusting
up
that
bit
of
spire
into
the
blue
if
it
happened
to
be
daylight
said
jack
making
a
tube
of
his
hand
and
regarding
the
picture
with
great
interest
miss
dora
at
her
window
beheld
the
movement
with
secret
horror
and
apprehension
and
took
it
for
some
mysterious
sign
i
know
nothing
about
mr
wodehouse
property
said
the
curate
i
wish
i
knew
enough
law
to
understand
it
he
has
left
no
will
i
believe
and
mr
wentworth
watched
his
brother
face
with
no
small
interest
as
he
spoke
very
like
a
constable
said
jack
still
with
his
hands
to
his
eyes
these
clouds
to
the
right
are
not
a
bad
imitation
of
some
effects
of
his
i
beg
your
pardon
but
constable
is
my
passion
and
so
old
wodehouse
has
left
no
will
what
he
left
some
daughters
excuse
my
curiosity
said
the
elder
brother
i
am
a
man
of
the
world
you
know
if
you
like
this
other
girl
well
enough
to
compromise
yourself
on
her
account
which
mind
you
i
think
a
great
mistake
you
mean
to
go
in
at
the
same
time
for
that
pretty
sister
eh
it
a
sort
of
sport
i
do
attempt
myself
though
it
may
be
the
correct
thing
for
a
clergyman
for
anything
i
can
tell
to
the
contrary
said
the
tolerant
critic
mr
wentworth
had
swallowed
down
the
interruptions
that
rushed
to
his
lips
and
heard
his
brother
out
with
unusual
patience
after
all
perhaps
jack
was
the
only
man
in
the
world
whom
he
could
ask
to
advise
him
in
such
an
emergency
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
do
mean
to
insult
either
me
or
my
profession
he
said
gravely
and
to
tell
the
truth
here
is
one
point
upon
which
i
should
be
glad
of
your
help
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
wodehouse
who
has
carried
away
this
unfortunate
girl
she
is
a
little
fool
and
he
has
imposed
upon
her
if
you
can
get
him
to
confess
this
and
to
restore
her
to
her
friends
you
will
lay
me
under
the
deepest
obligation
said
the
perpetual
curate
with
unusual
energy
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
such
a
slander
disables
me
and
goes
to
my
heart
when
he
had
once
begun
to
speak
on
the
subject
he
could
not
help
expressing
himself
fully
and
jack
who
had
grown
out
of
acquaintance
with
the
nobler
sentiments
woke
up
with
a
slight
start
through
all
his
moral
being
to
recognise
the
thrill
of
subdued
passion
and
scorn
and
grief
which
was
in
his
brother
voice
innocent
miss
dora
who
knew
no
evil
had
scarcely
a
doubt
in
mind
that
frank
was
guilty
but
jack
who
scarcely
knew
what
goodness
was
acquitted
his
brother
instantaneously
and
required
no
other
proof
perhaps
if
he
had
been
capable
of
any
impression
beyond
an
intellectual
one
this
little
incident
might
in
miss
own
language
have
done
him
good
so
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
said
with
a
smile
wodehouse
but
then
the
fellow
has
a
penny
i
see
some
one
skulking
along
under
the
walls
that
looks
like
him
hist
smith
tom
what
do
they
call
you
we
want
you
here
said
jack
upon
whom
the
moon
was
shining
full
when
he
stood
in
his
evening
coat
and
spotless
breadth
of
linen
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
was
ready
to
meet
the
eye
of
all
the
world
his
shabby
subordinate
stopped
short
with
a
kind
of
sullen
admiration
to
look
at
him
wodehouse
knew
the
nature
of
jack
wentworth
pursuits
a
great
deal
better
than
his
brother
did
and
that
some
of
them
would
not
bear
much
investigation
but
when
he
saw
him
stand
triumphant
in
gorgeous
apparel
fearing
no
man
the
poor
rascal
whom
everybody
kicked
at
rose
superior
to
his
own
misfortunes
he
had
not
made
much
of
it
in
his
own
person
but
that
life
was
not
altogether
a
failure
which
had
produced
jack
wentworth
he
obeyed
his
superior
call
with
instinctive
fidelity
proud
in
spite
of
himself
to
be
living
the
same
life
and
sharing
the
same
perils
when
he
emerged
into
the
moonlight
his
shaggy
countenance
looked
excited
and
haggard
notwithstanding
all
his
experiences
he
was
not
of
a
constitution
which
could
deny
nature
he
had
inflicted
every
kind
of
torture
upon
his
father
while
living
but
notwithstanding
the
fact
of
the
death
affected
him
his
eyes
looked
wilder
than
usual
and
his
face
older
and
more
worn
and
he
looked
round
him
with
a
kind
of
clandestine
skulking
instinct
as
he
came
out
of
the
shadow
into
the
light
this
was
the
terrible
conjunction
which
miss
dora
saw
from
her
window
the
anxious
woman
did
not
wait
long
enough
to
be
aware
that
the
curate
left
the
other
two
to
such
consultations
as
were
inevitable
between
them
and
went
away
very
hastily
to
his
own
house
and
to
the
work
which
still
awaited
him
when
the
wicked
man
turneth
away
from
the
evil
of
his
ways
and
doeth
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
mr
wentworth
when
he
came
back
to
it
sat
for
about
an
hour
over
his
text
before
he
wrote
a
single
syllable
his
heart
had
been
wrung
that
day
by
the
sharpest
pangs
which
can
be
inflicted
upon
a
proud
and
generous
spirit
he
was
disposed
to
be
bitter
against
all
the
world
against
the
dull
eyes
that
would
not
see
the
dull
ears
that
could
shut
themselves
against
all
suggestions
either
of
gratitude
or
justice
it
appeared
to
him
on
the
whole
that
the
wicked
man
was
every
way
the
best
off
in
this
world
besides
being
wooed
and
besought
to
accept
the
blessings
of
the
other
and
the
curate
was
conscious
of
an
irrepressible
inclination
to
exterminate
the
human
vermin
who
made
the
earth
such
an
imbroglio
of
distress
and
misery
and
was
sore
and
wounded
in
his
heart
to
feel
how
his
own
toils
and
honest
purposes
availed
him
nothing
and
how
all
the
interest
and
sympathy
of
bystanders
went
to
the
pretender
these
sentiments
naturally
complicated
his
thoughts
and
made
composition
difficult
not
to
say
that
they
added
a
thrill
of
human
feeling
warmer
than
usual
to
the
short
and
succinct
sermon
it
was
not
an
emotional
sermon
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
but
it
was
so
for
mr
wentworth
who
carried
to
an
extreme
point
the
anglican
dislike
for
pulpit
exaggeration
in
all
forms
the
perpetual
curate
was
not
a
natural
orator
he
had
very
little
of
the
eloquence
which
gave
mr
vincent
so
much
success
in
the
dissenting
connection
during
his
short
stay
in
carlingford
which
was
a
kind
of
popularity
not
much
to
the
taste
of
the
churchman
but
mr
wentworth
had
a
certain
faculty
of
concentrating
his
thoughts
into
the
tersest
expression
and
of
uttering
in
a
very
few
words
as
if
they
did
not
mean
anything
particular
ideas
which
were
always
individual
and
often
of
distinct
originality
a
kind
of
utterance
which
is
very
dear
to
the
english
mind
as
was
natural
there
were
but
a
limited
amount
of
people
able
to
find
him
out
but
those
who
did
so
were
rather
fond
of
talking
about
the
restrained
power
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
next
morning
was
a
glorious
summer
sunday
one
of
those
days
of
peace
on
which
this
tired
old
earth
takes
back
her
look
of
innocence
and
deludes
herself
with
thoughts
of
eden
to
be
sure
there
were
tumults
enough
going
on
over
her
surface
vulgar
and
noises
french
drums
beating
all
kinds
of
discordant
sounds
going
on
here
and
there
by
land
and
sea
under
that
tranquil
impartial
sun
but
the
air
was
very
still
in
carlingford
where
you
could
hear
the
bees
in
the
as
you
went
to
church
in
the
sunshine
all
that
world
of
soft
air
in
which
the
embowered
houses
of
grange
lane
lay
beatified
was
breathing
sweet
of
the
limes
but
notwithstanding
the
radiance
of
the
day
people
were
talking
of
other
subjects
as
they
came
down
under
the
shadow
of
the
to
st
roque
there
was
a
great
stream
of
people
greater
than
usual
for
carlingford
was
naturally
anxious
to
see
how
mr
wentworth
would
conduct
himself
in
such
an
emergency
on
one
side
of
the
way
mr
wodehouse
hospitable
house
shut
up
closely
and
turning
all
its
shuttered
windows
to
the
light
which
shone
serenely
indifferent
upon
the
blank
frames
stood
silent
dumbly
contributing
its
great
moral
to
the
human
holiday
and
on
the
other
elsworthy
closed
shop
with
the
blinds
drawn
over
the
cheerful
windows
above
where
little
rosa
once
amused
herself
watching
the
passengers
interposed
a
still
more
dreadful
discordance
the
carlingford
people
talked
of
both
occurrences
with
composure
as
they
went
to
st
roque
they
were
sorry
and
shocked
and
very
curious
but
that
wonderful
moral
atmosphere
of
human
indifference
and
which
surrounds
every
individual
soul
kept
their
feelings
quite
within
bounds
most
people
wondered
much
what
mr
wentworth
would
say
whether
he
would
really
venture
to
face
the
carlingford
world
whether
he
would
take
refuge
in
a
funeral
sermon
for
mr
wodehouse
or
how
it
was
possible
for
him
to
conduct
himself
under
such
circumstances
when
the
greater
part
of
the
congregation
was
seated
miss
leonora
wentworth
all
by
herself
in
her
silk
which
rustled
like
a
breeze
along
the
narrow
passage
although
she
wore
no
crinoline
went
up
to
a
seat
immediately
in
front
close
to
mr
wentworth
choristers
who
just
then
came
trooping
in
in
their
white
surplices
looking
like
angels
of
unequal
height
and
equivocal
reputation
miss
leonora
placed
herself
in
the
front
row
of
a
little
group
of
benches
arranged
at
the
side
just
where
the
curate
wife
would
have
been
placed
had
he
possessed
such
an
appendage
she
looked
down
blandly
upon
the
many
lines
of
faces
turned
towards
her
accepting
their
inspection
with
perfect
composure
though
her
principles
were
evangelical
miss
leonora
was
still
a
wentworth
and
a
woman
she
had
not
shown
any
sympathy
for
her
nephew
on
the
previous
night
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
stand
by
him
without
saying
anything
about
her
determination
this
incident
made
a
great
impression
on
the
mind
of
carlingford
most
likely
it
interfered
with
the
private
devotions
from
which
a
few
heads
popped
up
abruptly
as
she
passed
but
she
was
very
devout
and
exemplary
in
her
own
person
and
set
a
good
example
as
became
the
clergyman
aunt
excitement
rose
very
high
in
st
roque
when
mr
wentworth
came
into
the
and
elsworthy
black
as
a
cloud
became
visible
underneath
the
clerk
had
not
ventured
to
absent
himself
nor
to
send
a
substitute
in
his
place
never
in
the
days
when
he
was
most
devoted
to
mr
wentworth
had
elsworthy
been
more
determined
to
accompany
him
through
every
particular
of
the
service
they
had
stood
together
in
the
little
vestry
going
through
all
the
usual
preliminaries
the
curate
trying
hard
to
talk
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
clerk
going
through
all
his
duties
in
total
silence
perhaps
there
never
was
a
church
service
in
carlingford
which
was
followed
with
such
intense
interest
by
all
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
congregation
when
the
sermon
came
it
took
mr
wentworth
admirers
by
surprise
though
they
could
not
at
the
moment
make
out
what
it
was
that
puzzled
them
somehow
the
perverse
manner
in
which
for
once
the
curate
treated
that
wicked
man
who
is
generally
made
so
much
of
in
sermons
made
his
hearers
slightly
ashamed
of
themselves
as
for
miss
leonora
though
she
could
not
approve
of
his
sentiments
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
frank
was
not
nearly
so
like
his
family
as
she
had
supposed
him
to
be
when
the
service
was
over
she
kept
her
place
steadily
watching
all
the
worshippers
out
who
thronged
out
a
great
deal
more
hastily
than
usual
to
compare
notes
and
ask
each
other
what
they
thought
i
ca
fancy
he
looks
guilty
an
eager
voice
here
and
there
kept
saying
over
and
over
but
on
the
whole
after
they
had
got
over
the
momentary
impression
made
by
his
presence
and
aspect
the
opinion
of
carlingford
remained
unchanged
which
was
that
notwithstanding
all
the
evidence
of
his
previous
life
it
was
quite
believable
that
mr
wentworth
was
a
seducer
and
a
villain
and
ought
to
be
brought
to
condign
punishment
but
that
in
the
mean
time
it
was
very
interesting
to
watch
the
progress
of
this
startling
little
drama
and
that
he
himself
instead
of
merely
being
the
curate
of
st
roque
had
become
a
most
captivating
enigma
and
had
made
itself
half
as
good
as
a
play
as
for
miss
leonora
she
waited
for
her
nephew
and
when
he
was
ready
took
his
arm
and
walked
with
him
up
grange
lane
to
her
own
door
where
they
encountered
miss
wentworth
and
miss
dora
returning
from
church
and
overwhelmed
them
with
astonishment
but
it
was
not
about
his
own
affairs
that
they
talked
miss
leonora
did
not
say
a
word
to
her
nephew
about
himself
she
was
talking
of
gerald
most
of
the
time
and
inquiring
into
all
the
particulars
of
the
squire
late
attack
and
she
would
very
fain
have
found
out
what
jack
motive
was
in
coming
to
carlingford
but
as
for
rosa
elsworthy
and
her
concerns
the
woman
ignored
them
completely
mr
wentworth
even
went
with
her
to
lunch
on
her
urgent
invitation
and
it
was
from
his
aunts
house
that
he
took
his
way
to
wharfside
pausing
at
the
green
door
to
ask
after
the
miss
wodehouses
who
were
john
said
with
solemnity
as
well
as
could
be
expected
they
were
alone
and
they
did
not
feel
equal
to
seeing
anybody
even
mr
wentworth
and
the
perpetual
curate
who
would
have
given
all
he
had
in
the
world
for
permission
to
soothe
lucy
in
her
sorrow
went
away
sadly
from
the
hospitable
door
which
was
now
for
the
first
time
closed
to
him
he
could
not
go
to
wharfside
to
the
district
through
which
they
had
so
often
gone
together
about
which
they
had
talked
when
all
the
little
details
discussed
were
sweet
with
the
love
which
they
did
not
name
without
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
that
sweet
shadow
of
lucy
which
was
upon
his
way
wherever
he
went
he
could
not
help
missing
her
voice
when
the
little
choir
which
was
so
feeble
without
her
sang
the
which
somehow
mr
wentworth
always
associated
with
her
image
he
read
the
same
sermon
to
the
wharfside
people
which
he
had
preached
in
st
roque
and
saw
with
a
little
surprise
that
it
drew
tears
from
the
eyes
of
his
more
hearers
who
did
not
think
of
the
proprieties
he
could
see
their
hands
stealing
up
to
their
faces
and
a
great
deal
of
persistent
winking
on
the
part
of
the
stronger
members
of
the
congregation
at
the
close
of
the
service
tom
burrows
came
up
to
the
curate
with
a
downcast
countenance
please
sir
if
done
ye
injustice
in
my
own
mind
as
went
sore
against
the
grain
and
would
have
happened
but
for
the
women
i
axes
your
pardon
said
the
honest
bargeman
which
was
balm
and
consolation
to
mr
wentworth
there
was
much
talk
in
prickett
lane
on
the
subject
as
he
went
to
see
the
sick
woman
in
no
there
aint
no
doubt
as
he
sets
our
duty
before
us
clear
said
one
family
mother
he
do
leave
the
men
no
excuse
for
their
he
all
but
named
the
bargeman
arms
out
plain
as
it
was
the
place
all
mischief
comes
from
if
he
have
married
miss
lucy
like
other
folks
at
easter
said
one
of
the
brides
whom
mr
wentworth
had
blessed
such
wicked
stories
could
never
have
been
made
up
a
story
may
be
made
up
or
it
may
be
made
up
said
a
more
experienced
matron
but
it
ca
be
put
out
of
the
world
unbeknowst
no
more
nor
a
babby
i
do
believe
in
stories
getting
up
that
aint
true
i
do
say
as
he
do
do
his
duty
but
things
was
different
in
mr
bury
time
as
was
the
real
rector
and
as
i
was
a
tale
like
a
babby
it
may
come
when
it
did
ought
to
come
or
when
it
aint
wanted
but
you
ca
do
away
with
it
anyhow
as
you
like
to
try
mr
wentworth
did
not
hear
this
dreary
prediction
as
he
went
back
again
into
the
upper
world
he
was
in
much
better
spirits
on
the
whole
he
had
calmed
his
own
mind
and
moved
the
hearts
of
others
which
is
to
every
man
a
gratification
even
though
nothing
higher
should
be
involved
and
he
had
regained
the
moral
countenance
of
tom
burrows
which
most
of
all
was
a
comfort
to
him
more
than
ever
he
longed
to
go
and
tell
lucy
as
he
passed
by
the
green
door
tom
burrows
repentant
face
recalled
mr
wentworth
mind
to
the
fact
that
a
great
work
was
doing
in
wharfside
which
after
all
was
more
worth
thinking
of
than
any
tantalising
vision
of
an
impossible
benefice
but
this
very
thought
so
consoling
in
itself
reminded
him
of
all
his
vexations
of
the
public
inquiry
into
his
conduct
which
was
hanging
over
him
and
of
his
want
of
power
to
offer
to
lucy
the
support
and
protection
of
which
she
might
so
soon
stand
in
need
and
having
thus
drawn
upon
his
head
once
more
his
whole
burden
of
troubles
mr
wentworth
went
in
to
eat
his
dinner
with
what
appetite
he
could
the
perpetual
curate
sat
up
late
that
night
as
indeed
was
his
custom
he
sat
late
hearing
as
everybody
does
who
sits
up
alone
in
a
hushed
and
sleeping
household
a
hundred
fantastic
creaks
and
sounds
which
did
not
mean
anything
and
of
which
he
took
no
notice
once
indeed
when
it
was
nearly
midnight
he
fancied
he
heard
the
close
hurriedly
but
explained
it
to
himself
as
people
do
when
they
prefer
not
to
give
themselves
trouble
about
one
in
the
morning
however
mr
wentworth
could
no
longer
be
in
any
doubt
that
some
stealthy
step
was
passing
his
door
and
moving
about
the
house
he
was
not
alarmed
for
mrs
hadwin
had
occasional
attacks
like
most
people
of
her
age
but
he
put
down
his
pen
and
listened
no
other
sound
was
to
be
heard
except
this
stealthy
step
no
opening
of
doors
nor
whisper
of
voices
nor
commotion
of
any
kind
and
after
a
while
mr
wentworth
curiosity
was
fully
awakened
when
he
heard
it
again
he
opened
his
door
suddenly
and
threw
a
light
upon
the
staircase
and
little
corridor
into
which
his
room
opened
the
figure
he
saw
there
startled
him
more
than
if
it
had
been
a
midnight
robber
it
was
only
sarah
the
housemaid
white
and
shivering
with
terror
who
fell
down
upon
her
knees
before
him
oh
mr
wentworth
it
aint
my
fault
cried
sarah
the
poor
girl
was
only
partially
dressed
and
trembled
pitifully
they
say
it
was
my
fault
and
oh
sir
it
my
character
i
of
said
sarah
with
a
sob
and
the
curate
saw
behind
her
the
door
of
wodehouse
room
standing
open
and
the
moonlight
streaming
into
the
empty
apartment
i
dare
go
to
see
if
he
took
anything
cried
poor
sarah
under
her
breath
there
might
be
more
of
them
about
the
place
but
oh
mr
wentworth
if
missis
finds
out
as
i
gave
him
the
key
what
will
become
of
me
naturally
it
was
her
own
danger
which
had
most
effect
upon
sarah
her
full
face
was
all
wet
and
stained
with
crying
her
lips
quivering
her
eyes
dilated
perhaps
a
thrill
of
private
disappointment
mingled
with
her
dread
of
losing
her
character
he
used
to
tell
me
all
as
he
was
to
do
said
sarah
but
oh
sir
he
been
and
gone
away
and
i
dare
go
to
look
at
the
plate
and
i
never
more
sleep
in
quiet
if
i
was
to
live
a
century
it
aint
as
i
care
for
but
it
the
key
and
my
character
as
i
of
cried
the
poor
girl
bursting
into
audible
sobs
that
could
be
restrained
no
longer
mr
wentworth
took
a
candle
and
went
into
wodehouse
empty
room
leaving
her
to
recover
her
composure
everything
was
cleared
and
packed
up
in
that
apartment
the
little
personal
property
he
had
the
shabby
boots
and
worn
habiliments
had
disappeared
totally
even
the
rubbish
of
on
his
table
was
cleared
away
not
a
trace
that
he
had
been
there
a
few
hours
ago
remained
in
the
place
the
curate
came
out
of
the
room
with
an
anxious
countenance
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
it
and
by
this
time
sarah
sobs
had
roused
mrs
hadwin
who
stood
severe
and
indignant
at
her
own
door
in
her
nightcap
to
know
what
was
the
matter
mr
wentworth
retired
into
his
own
apartments
after
a
word
of
explanation
leaving
the
mistress
and
maid
to
fight
it
out
he
himself
was
more
disturbed
and
excited
than
he
could
have
described
he
could
not
tell
what
this
new
step
meant
but
felt
instinctively
that
it
denoted
some
new
development
in
the
tangled
web
of
his
own
fortunes
some
hidden
danger
seemed
to
him
to
be
gathering
in
the
air
over
the
house
of
mourning
of
which
he
had
constituted
himself
a
kind
of
guardian
he
could
not
sleep
all
night
but
kept
starting
at
every
sound
thinking
now
that
the
skulking
rascal
who
was
lucy
brother
was
coming
back
and
now
that
his
departure
was
only
a
dream
mr
wentworth
restlessness
was
not
soothed
by
hearing
all
the
night
through
in
the
silence
of
the
house
suppressed
sobs
and
sounds
of
weeping
proceeding
from
the
attic
overhead
which
poor
sarah
shared
with
her
perhaps
the
civilities
of
the
gentleman
had
dazzled
sarah
and
been
too
much
for
her
peace
of
mind
perhaps
it
was
only
her
character
as
the
poor
girl
said
but
as
often
as
the
curate
started
from
his
uneasy
and
broken
snatches
of
sleep
he
heard
the
murmur
of
crying
and
consoling
outside
the
night
was
spreading
forth
those
sweetest
unseen
glories
of
the
starlight
and
the
moonlight
and
the
silence
which
nature
reserves
for
her
own
enjoyment
when
the
weary
human
creatures
are
out
of
the
way
and
at
rest
and
jack
wentworth
slept
the
sleep
of
the
righteous
uttering
delicate
little
indications
of
the
depth
of
his
slumber
which
it
would
have
been
profane
to
call
by
any
vulgar
name
slept
sweetly
while
his
brother
watched
and
longed
for
daylight
impatient
for
the
morrow
which
must
bring
forth
something
new
the
moonlight
streamed
full
into
the
empty
room
and
made
mysterious
combinations
of
the
furniture
and
chased
the
darkness
into
corners
which
each
held
their
secret
this
was
how
mrs
hadwin
strange
lodger
whom
nobody
could
ever
make
out
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
without
any
explanations
and
only
a
very
few
people
could
ever
come
to
understand
what
he
had
to
do
with
the
which
struck
grange
lane
dumb
and
turned
into
utter
confusion
all
the
ideas
and
conclusions
of
society
in
carlingford
chapter
xxxi
i
will
do
what
i
can
for
you
said
mr
morgan
yours
is
a
very
hard
case
as
you
say
of
course
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
give
any
opinion
but
such
a
thing
shall
not
occur
in
carlingford
while
i
am
here
without
being
looked
into
said
the
rector
with
dignity
of
that
you
may
be
sure
i
do
want
no
more
nor
justice
said
elsworthy
no
more
nor
justice
i
a
man
as
has
always
been
respected
and
never
interfered
with
nobody
as
did
interfere
with
me
the
things
i
stood
from
my
clergyman
i
would
have
stood
from
no
man
living
the
way
as
he
talk
sir
of
them
as
was
a
deal
better
than
himself
we
was
a
happy
family
afore
mr
wentworth
came
nigh
of
us
most
folks
in
carlingford
knows
me
there
was
a
more
industrious
family
in
carlingford
though
i
say
it
as
should
nor
one
as
was
more
content
or
took
things
more
agreeable
afore
mr
wentworth
come
to
put
all
wrong
mr
wentworth
has
been
here
for
five
years
said
the
rector
wife
who
was
present
at
this
interview
have
things
been
going
wrong
for
all
that
time
i
could
describe
to
nobody
what
i
put
up
with
said
the
clerk
of
st
roque
evading
the
question
he
had
the
ways
of
such
clergymen
as
i
been
used
to
twice
the
pay
would
have
made
up
for
what
i
suffered
in
my
feelings
and
i
ask
you
sir
is
this
how
it
all
to
end
my
little
girl
gone
cried
elsworthy
rising
into
hoarse
earnestness
my
little
girl
as
was
so
sweet
and
as
everybody
took
notice
on
she
gone
and
i
do
know
as
i
ever
see
her
again
and
i
ca
get
no
satisfaction
one
way
or
another
and
i
ask
you
sir
is
a
villain
as
could
do
such
a
thing
to
hold
up
his
head
in
the
town
and
go
on
the
same
as
ever
i
aint
a
man
as
is
contrairy
or
as
goes
agin
my
superiors
but
it
driving
me
mad
that
what
doing
said
elsworthy
wiping
the
moisture
from
his
forehead
the
man
was
trembling
and
haggard
changed
even
in
his
looks
his
eyes
were
red
with
passion
and
watching
and
looked
like
the
eyes
of
a
wild
beast
lying
in
wait
for
its
prey
i
ca
say
as
i
ever
slept
an
hour
since
it
happened
he
cried
and
as
for
my
missis
of
her
we
aint
shut
up
because
we
got
to
live
all
the
same
and
because
if
the
poor
thing
come
back
there
always
an
open
door
but
i
have
justice
if
i
was
to
die
for
it
cried
elsworthy
i
do
ask
no
more
than
justice
if
it
aint
to
be
had
one
way
have
it
another
i
set
the
police
on
him
i
will
when
a
drove
wild
he
aint
answerable
for
what
he
and
to
see
him
about
carlingford
and
up
his
head
is
a
thing
as
i
wo
stand
no
longer
not
if
it
was
to
be
my
ruin
i
as
good
as
ruined
now
and
i
do
care
he
broke
off
short
with
these
words
and
sat
down
abruptly
on
the
chair
thomas
had
placed
for
him
in
front
of
the
rector
table
up
to
this
moment
he
had
been
standing
in
his
vehemence
and
agitation
without
taking
advantage
of
the
courtesy
accorded
to
his
misfortune
now
the
poor
man
sat
down
by
way
of
emphasis
and
began
to
polish
his
hat
round
and
round
with
his
trembling
hands
as
for
mr
morgan
he
on
the
contrary
got
up
and
walked
instinctively
to
the
fireplace
and
stood
there
with
his
back
to
the
empty
grate
contemplating
the
world
in
general
with
a
troubled
countenance
as
was
usual
not
to
speak
of
his
prejudice
against
mr
wentworth
the
rector
was
moved
by
the
sight
of
elsworthy
distress
but
then
his
wife
who
unluckily
had
brought
her
needlework
into
the
library
on
this
particular
morning
and
who
was
in
the
interest
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
was
seated
watchful
by
the
window
occasionally
looking
up
and
entirely
cognisant
as
mr
morgan
was
aware
of
everything
that
happened
the
rector
was
much
embarrassed
to
feel
himself
thus
standing
between
the
two
parties
yours
is
a
very
hard
case
but
it
is
necessary
to
proceed
with
caution
for
after
all
there
is
not
much
proof
he
said
faltering
a
little
my
dear
it
is
a
pity
to
detain
you
from
your
walk
mr
morgan
continued
after
a
momentary
pause
and
looked
with
a
flush
of
consciousness
at
his
wife
whose
absence
would
have
been
such
a
relief
to
him
mrs
morgan
looked
up
with
a
gracious
smile
you
are
not
detaining
me
william
i
am
very
much
interested
said
the
designing
woman
and
immediately
began
to
arrange
and
put
in
order
what
the
rector
knew
by
experience
to
be
a
long
piece
of
work
likely
to
last
her
an
hour
at
least
mr
morgan
uttered
a
long
breath
which
sounded
like
a
little
snort
of
despair
it
is
very
difficult
to
know
what
to
do
said
the
rector
shifting
uneasily
upon
the
hearthrug
and
plunging
his
hands
into
the
depths
of
his
pockets
if
you
could
name
anybody
you
would
like
to
refer
it
to
but
being
a
brother
clergyman
a
man
as
conducts
himself
like
that
did
ought
to
be
a
clergyman
sir
cried
elsworthy
i
one
as
listened
to
him
preaching
on
sunday
and
could
have
jumped
up
and
dragged
him
out
of
the
pulpit
to
hear
him
as
if
he
was
a
bigger
sinner
nor
any
there
i
aint
safe
to
stand
it
another
sunday
i
do
something
as
i
should
be
sorry
for
after
i
asking
justice
and
no
more
with
these
words
elsworthy
got
up
again
still
turning
round
in
his
hands
the
unlucky
hat
and
turned
his
person
though
not
his
eyes
towards
mrs
morgan
no
man
could
be
more
partial
to
his
clergyman
nor
i
was
he
said
hoarsely
there
was
never
a
time
as
i
was
glad
to
see
him
he
came
in
and
out
as
if
it
belonged
to
him
and
i
had
no
more
thought
as
he
was
meaning
any
harm
than
the
babe
unborn
but
a
man
as
meddles
with
an
innocent
girl
aint
nothing
but
a
villain
cried
elsworthy
with
a
gleam
out
of
his
red
eyes
and
i
do
believe
as
anybody
would
take
his
part
as
knew
all
i
put
my
confidence
in
the
rector
as
is
responsible
for
the
parish
he
went
on
facing
round
again
not
to
say
but
what
natural
for
them
as
are
mr
wentworth
friends
to
take
his
part
but
i
have
justice
wherever
it
comes
from
it
hard
work
to
go
any
lady
as
i
a
great
respect
for
and
would
cross
for
the
world
but
it
aint
in
reason
that
i
should
be
asked
to
bear
it
and
not
say
nothing
and
i
have
justice
if
i
should
die
for
it
said
elsworthy
he
turned
from
one
to
another
as
he
spoke
but
kept
his
eyes
upon
his
hat
which
he
smoothed
and
smoothed
as
if
his
life
depended
on
it
but
for
the
reality
of
his
excitement
his
red
eyes
and
hoarse
voice
he
would
have
been
a
ludicrous
figure
standing
as
he
did
in
the
middle
of
mr
morgan
library
veering
round
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
with
his
stooping
head
and
ungainly
person
as
for
the
rector
he
too
kept
looking
at
his
wife
with
a
very
troubled
face
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
act
against
a
brother
clergyman
said
mr
morgan
but
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
elsworthy
very
sorry
if
you
could
name
say
gentlemen
but
do
you
think
said
the
rector
wife
interposing
that
you
should
inquire
first
whether
there
is
any
evidence
it
would
make
you
all
look
very
ridiculous
if
you
got
up
an
inquiry
and
found
no
proof
against
mr
wentworth
is
it
likely
he
would
do
such
a
thing
all
at
once
without
showing
any
signs
of
wickedness
beforehand
is
it
possible
to
be
sorry
is
quite
a
different
thing
but
i
do
see
ladies
do
understand
such
matters
said
the
rector
who
had
been
kept
at
bay
so
long
that
he
began
to
get
desperate
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
but
it
is
not
a
matter
for
you
to
discuss
we
shall
take
good
care
that
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
said
the
perplexed
man
i
mean
before
we
proceed
to
do
anything
he
added
growing
very
red
and
confused
when
mr
morgan
caught
his
wife
eye
he
got
as
nearly
into
a
passion
as
was
possible
for
so
good
a
man
you
know
what
i
mean
he
said
in
his
peremptory
way
and
my
dear
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
this
is
not
a
matter
to
be
discussed
before
a
lady
when
he
had
uttered
this
bold
speech
the
rector
took
a
few
little
walks
up
and
down
the
room
not
caring
however
to
look
at
his
wife
he
was
ashamed
of
the
feeling
he
had
that
her
absence
would
set
him
much
more
at
ease
with
elsworthy
but
still
could
not
help
being
conscious
that
it
was
so
he
did
not
say
anything
more
but
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
sharp
short
steps
and
betrayed
his
impatience
very
manifestly
as
for
mrs
morgan
who
was
a
sensible
woman
she
saw
that
the
time
had
come
for
her
to
retire
from
the
field
i
think
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
try
every
possible
means
of
finding
the
girl
she
said
getting
up
from
her
seat
but
i
have
no
doubt
what
you
decide
upon
will
be
the
best
you
will
find
me
in
the
when
you
want
me
william
perhaps
her
absence
for
the
first
moment
was
not
such
a
relief
to
her
husband
as
he
had
expected
the
mildness
of
her
parting
words
made
it
very
apparent
that
she
did
not
mean
to
take
offence
and
he
perceived
suddenly
at
a
glance
that
he
would
have
to
tell
her
all
he
was
going
to
do
and
encounter
her
criticism
which
was
rather
an
appalling
prospect
to
the
rector
mrs
morgan
for
her
part
went
not
without
a
little
vexation
certainly
but
with
a
comforting
sense
of
the
opportunity
which
awaited
her
she
felt
that
in
his
unprotected
position
as
soon
as
she
left
him
the
rector
would
conduct
himself
rashly
and
that
her
time
was
still
to
come
the
rector
went
back
to
the
hearthrug
when
his
wife
left
the
room
but
in
the
heat
of
his
own
personal
reflections
he
did
not
say
anything
to
elsworthy
who
still
stood
smoothing
his
hat
in
his
hand
on
the
whole
mr
morgan
was
rather
aggravated
for
the
moment
by
the
unlucky
cause
of
this
little
encounter
and
was
not
half
so
well
disposed
towards
mr
wentworth
enemy
as
half
an
hour
before
when
he
recognised
his
wife
as
the
champion
of
the
curate
and
felt
controlled
by
her
presence
for
the
human
and
even
the
clerical
mind
has
its
impulses
of
perversity
he
began
to
get
very
impatient
of
hat
and
the
persistent
way
in
which
he
worked
at
it
with
his
hands
i
suppose
you
would
not
be
so
certain
about
it
if
you
had
not
satisfactory
evidence
he
said
turning
abruptly
and
even
a
little
angrily
upon
the
supplicant
for
mr
morgan
naturally
resented
his
own
temper
and
the
little
he
had
got
into
upon
the
third
person
who
was
the
cause
of
all
sir
said
elsworthy
with
eagerness
it
aint
no
wonder
to
me
as
the
lady
takes
mr
wentworth
part
a
poor
man
do
stand
no
chance
against
a
young
gentleman
as
has
had
every
advantage
it
a
thing
as
i
prepared
for
and
it
do
have
no
effect
upon
me
a
lady
as
is
so
respected
and
thought
a
deal
of
both
in
town
and
country
i
was
not
speaking
of
my
wife
said
the
rector
hastily
do
you
think
you
had
better
put
down
your
hat
i
think
you
said
it
was
on
friday
it
occurred
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
down
the
facts
in
a
way
said
mr
morgan
drawing
his
chair
towards
the
table
and
taking
up
his
pen
this
was
how
the
rector
was
occupied
when
thomas
announced
the
most
unexpected
of
all
possible
visitors
mr
proctor
who
had
been
mr
morgan
predecessor
in
carlingford
thomas
announced
his
old
master
with
great
solemnity
as
the
late
rector
a
title
which
struck
the
present
incumbent
with
a
sense
of
awe
not
unnatural
in
the
circumstances
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
let
his
pen
fall
out
of
his
startled
fingers
when
his
old
friend
came
in
they
had
eaten
many
a
good
dinner
together
in
the
revered
hall
of
and
as
the
familiar
countenance
met
his
eyes
perhaps
a
regretful
thought
of
that
elysium
stole
across
the
mind
of
the
late
fellow
who
had
been
so
glad
to
leave
the
sacred
brotherhood
and
marry
and
become
as
other
men
he
gave
but
a
few
hurried
words
of
surprise
and
welcome
to
his
visitor
and
then
with
a
curious
counterpoise
of
sentiment
sent
him
to
see
my
wife
feeling
even
while
half
envious
of
him
a
kind
of
superiority
and
half
contempt
for
the
man
who
was
not
a
rector
and
married
but
had
given
up
both
these
possibilities
when
he
sent
him
to
see
my
wife
mr
morgan
looked
after
the
elderly
celibate
with
a
certain
pity
one
always
feels
more
inclined
to
take
the
simple
view
of
any
matter
to
stand
up
for
injured
innocence
and
to
right
the
wronged
when
one
feels
one
self
better
off
than
one
neighbours
a
reverse
position
is
apt
to
detract
from
the
simplicity
of
conceptions
and
to
suggest
two
sides
to
the
picture
when
mr
proctor
was
gone
the
rector
addressed
himself
with
great
devotion
to
elsworthy
and
his
evidence
it
could
not
be
doubted
at
least
that
the
man
was
in
earnest
and
believed
what
he
said
and
things
unquestionably
looked
rather
ugly
for
mr
wentworth
mr
morgan
took
down
all
about
the
untimely
visit
to
elsworthy
on
the
night
when
he
took
rosa
home
and
when
he
came
to
the
evidence
of
the
miss
hemmings
who
had
seen
the
curate
talking
to
the
unfortunate
little
girl
at
his
own
door
the
last
time
she
was
seen
in
carlingford
the
rector
shook
his
head
with
a
prolonged
movement
half
of
satisfaction
half
of
regret
for
to
be
sure
he
had
made
up
his
mind
beforehand
who
the
culprit
was
and
it
was
to
a
certain
extent
satisfactory
to
have
his
opinion
confirmed
this
looks
very
bad
very
bad
i
am
sorry
to
say
said
mr
morgan
for
the
unhappy
young
man
own
sake
an
investigation
is
absolutely
necessary
as
for
you
elsworthy
everybody
must
be
sorry
for
you
have
you
no
idea
where
he
could
have
taken
the
poor
girl
that
is
said
the
uncautious
rector
supposing
that
he
is
guilty
of
which
i
am
afraid
there
does
not
seem
much
doubt
there
aint
no
doubt
said
elsworthy
there
aint
nobody
else
as
could
have
done
it
just
afore
my
little
girl
was
took
away
sir
mr
wentworth
went
off
of
a
sudden
and
it
was
said
as
he
was
home
to
the
hall
i
was
of
sending
a
letter
anonymous
to
ask
if
it
was
known
what
he
was
after
i
read
in
the
papers
the
other
day
as
his
brother
was
over
to
rome
there
do
seem
to
be
none
them
the
right
sort
which
it
terrible
for
two
clergymen
i
was
thinking
of
dropping
a
bit
of
a
note
anonymous
no
no
no
said
the
rector
that
would
never
do
nothing
of
that
sort
elsworthy
if
you
thought
it
likely
she
was
there
the
proper
thing
would
be
to
go
and
inquire
nothing
anonymous
no
no
that
is
a
thing
i
could
not
possibly
countenance
said
mr
morgan
he
pushed
away
his
pen
and
paper
and
got
very
red
and
uncomfortable
if
either
of
the
critics
his
wife
or
his
predecessor
in
the
rectory
could
but
know
that
he
was
having
an
anonymous
letter
suggested
to
him
that
anybody
ventured
to
think
him
capable
of
being
an
accomplice
in
such
proceedings
the
presence
of
these
two
in
the
house
though
they
were
most
probably
at
the
moment
engaged
in
the
calmest
abstract
conversation
and
totally
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
library
had
a
great
effect
upon
the
rector
he
felt
insulted
that
any
man
could
venture
to
confide
such
an
intention
to
him
almost
within
the
hearing
of
his
wife
if
i
am
to
take
up
your
case
everything
must
be
open
and
straightforward
said
mr
morgan
while
elsworthy
who
saw
that
he
had
said
something
amiss
without
precisely
understanding
what
took
up
his
hat
as
a
resource
and
once
more
began
to
polish
it
round
and
round
in
his
hands
i
did
mean
no
harm
sir
i
sure
he
said
i
do
seem
to
see
no
other
way
o
finding
out
for
i
aint
like
a
rich
man
as
can
go
and
come
as
he
pleases
but
i
wo
say
no
more
since
it
displeasing
to
you
if
you
give
me
the
list
of
names
sir
as
you
have
decided
on
to
be
the
committee
i
would
trouble
you
no
longer
seeing
as
you
got
visitors
perhaps
if
the
late
rector
aint
going
away
directly
he
would
take
it
kind
to
be
put
on
the
committee
and
he
a
gentleman
as
i
a
great
respect
for
though
he
was
not
to
say
the
man
for
carlingford
said
elsworthy
with
a
sidelong
look
he
began
to
feel
the
importance
of
his
own
position
as
the
originator
of
a
committee
and
at
the
head
of
the
most
exciting
movement
which
had
been
for
a
long
time
in
carlingford
and
could
not
help
being
sensible
notwithstanding
his
affliction
that
he
had
a
distinction
to
offer
which
even
the
late
rector
might
be
pleased
to
accept
i
do
think
mr
proctor
will
stay
said
mr
morgan
and
if
he
does
stay
i
believe
he
is
a
friend
of
mr
wentworth
it
was
only
after
he
had
said
this
that
the
rector
perceived
the
meaning
of
the
words
he
had
uttered
then
in
his
confusion
and
vexation
he
got
up
hastily
from
the
table
and
upset
the
inkstand
in
all
the
embarrassment
of
the
moment
of
course
that
is
all
the
greater
reason
for
having
his
assistance
said
mr
morgan
in
his
perplexity
we
are
all
friends
of
mr
wentworth
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
ring
the
bell
there
are
few
things
more
painful
than
to
take
steps
against
a
brother
clergyman
if
one
did
not
hope
it
would
be
for
his
benefit
in
the
end
oh
never
mind
the
table
be
so
good
as
to
ring
the
bell
again
louder
please
there
aint
nothing
equal
to
sir
said
elsworthy
eagerly
with
a
bit
o
i
undertake
to
rub
out
out
o
the
finest
carpet
if
you
permit
me
it
aint
but
a
small
speck
and
it
be
gone
afore
you
could
look
round
it
twenty
times
better
nor
or
them
poisonous
salts
as
you
always
nervous
of
leaving
about
look
you
here
sir
if
it
aint
up
beautiful
there
aint
no
harm
done
as
your
respected
lady
could
be
put
out
about
and
i
take
the
list
with
me
if
you
please
to
show
to
my
wife
as
is
her
heart
at
home
and
ca
believe
as
ever
get
justice
she
says
as
how
the
quality
always
takes
a
part
against
us
poor
folks
but
that
aint
been
my
experience
do
you
touch
the
carpet
thomas
there
aint
a
speck
to
be
seen
when
the
cleared
away
i
go
home
not
to
detain
you
no
more
sir
and
cheer
up
the
poor
heart
as
is
said
elsworthy
getting
up
from
his
knees
where
he
had
been
operating
upon
the
carpet
he
had
got
in
his
hand
the
list
of
names
which
mr
morgan
had
put
down
as
referees
in
this
painful
business
and
it
dawned
faintly
upon
the
rector
for
the
moment
that
he
himself
was
taking
rather
an
undignified
position
as
elsworthy
partisan
i
have
no
objection
to
your
showing
it
to
your
wife
said
mr
morgan
but
i
shall
be
much
displeased
if
i
hear
any
talk
about
it
elsworthy
and
i
hope
it
is
not
revenge
you
are
thinking
of
which
is
a
very
unchristian
sentiment
said
the
rector
severely
and
not
likely
to
afford
comfort
either
to
her
or
to
you
no
sir
nothing
but
justice
said
elsworthy
hoarsely
as
he
backed
out
of
the
room
notwithstanding
this
statement
it
was
with
very
unsatisfactory
sensations
that
mr
morgan
went
he
felt
somehow
as
if
the
justice
which
elsworthy
demanded
and
which
he
himself
had
solemnly
declared
to
be
pursuing
the
curate
of
st
roque
was
wonderfully
like
revenge
all
punishment
must
be
more
or
less
vindictive
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
but
that
fact
did
not
make
him
more
comfortable
as
he
went
into
his
wife
where
he
felt
more
like
a
conspirator
and
assassin
than
an
english
rector
in
broad
daylight
without
a
mystery
near
him
had
any
right
to
feel
this
sensation
confused
mr
morgan
much
and
made
him
more
peremptory
in
his
manner
than
ever
as
for
mr
proctor
who
was
only
a
spectator
and
felt
himself
on
a
certain
critical
eminence
the
suggestion
that
occurred
to
his
mind
was
that
he
had
come
in
at
the
end
of
a
quarrel
and
that
the
conjugal
firmament
was
still
in
a
state
of
disturbance
which
idea
acted
upon
some
private
projects
in
the
hidden
mind
of
the
fellow
of
and
produced
a
state
of
feeling
little
more
satisfactory
than
that
of
the
rector
of
carlingford
i
hope
mr
proctor
is
going
to
stay
with
us
for
a
day
or
two
said
mrs
morgan
i
was
just
saying
it
must
look
like
coming
home
to
come
to
the
house
he
used
to
live
in
and
which
was
even
furnished
to
his
own
taste
said
the
rector
wife
shooting
a
little
arrow
at
the
late
rector
of
which
that
good
man
was
serenely
unconscious
all
this
time
while
they
had
been
talking
mrs
morgan
had
scarcely
been
able
to
keep
from
asking
who
could
possibly
have
suggested
such
a
carpet
mr
proctor
chair
was
placed
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
big
bouquets
which
expanded
its
large
foliage
round
him
with
more
than
eastern
prodigality
but
he
was
so
little
conscious
of
any
culpability
of
his
own
in
the
matter
that
he
had
referred
his
indignant
hostess
to
one
of
the
leaves
as
an
illustration
of
the
kind
of
diaper
introduced
into
the
new
window
which
had
lately
been
put
up
in
the
chapel
of
a
naturalistic
treatment
you
know
said
mr
proctor
with
the
utmost
serenity
and
some
people
objected
to
it
added
the
unsuspicious
man
i
should
have
objected
very
strongly
said
mrs
morgan
with
a
little
flush
if
you
call
that
naturalistic
treatment
i
consider
it
perfectly
out
of
place
in
decoration
of
every
kind
mr
proctor
happened
to
be
looking
at
her
at
the
moment
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
miss
wodehouse
never
got
red
in
that
uncomfortable
way
which
was
the
only
conclusion
he
drew
from
the
circumstance
having
long
ago
forgotten
that
any
connection
had
ever
existed
between
himself
and
the
carpet
on
the
in
carlingford
rectory
he
addressed
his
next
observation
to
mr
morgan
who
had
just
come
in
i
saw
mr
wodehouse
death
in
the
said
mr
proctor
and
i
thought
the
poor
young
ladies
might
feel
at
least
they
might
think
it
a
respect
or
at
all
events
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
self
said
the
late
rector
who
had
got
into
a
mire
of
explanation
though
he
was
far
from
being
a
young
man
yet
having
a
young
daughter
like
miss
lucy
poor
lucy
said
mr
morgan
i
hope
that
wretched
fellow
young
wentworth
and
here
the
rector
came
to
a
dead
stop
and
felt
that
he
had
brought
the
subject
most
to
be
avoided
head
and
shoulders
into
the
conversation
as
was
natural
to
an
embarrassed
man
the
consequence
was
that
he
got
angry
as
might
have
been
expected
my
dear
you
must
not
look
at
me
as
you
do
i
have
just
been
hearing
all
the
evidence
no
unbiassed
mind
could
possibly
come
to
any
other
decision
said
mr
morgan
with
exasperation
now
that
he
had
committed
himself
he
thought
it
was
much
the
best
thing
to
go
in
for
it
wholly
without
half
measures
which
was
certainly
the
most
straightforward
way
what
has
happened
to
wentworth
said
mr
proctor
he
is
a
young
man
for
whom
i
have
a
great
regard
though
he
is
so
much
younger
than
i
am
he
taught
me
some
lessons
while
i
was
in
carlingford
which
i
shall
never
forget
if
he
is
in
any
trouble
that
i
can
help
him
in
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
it
both
for
his
sake
and
for
mr
proctor
slurred
over
the
end
of
his
sentence
a
little
and
the
others
were
occupied
with
their
own
difficulties
and
did
not
take
very
much
notice
for
it
was
difficult
to
state
fully
the
nature
and
extent
of
mr
enormities
after
such
a
declaration
of
friendship
i
met
him
on
my
way
here
said
the
fellow
of
not
looking
quite
as
he
used
to
do
i
supposed
it
might
be
mr
wodehouse
death
perhaps
all
mr
proctor
thoughts
ran
in
that
channel
of
mr
wodehouse
death
which
after
all
though
sad
enough
was
not
so
great
an
event
to
the
community
in
general
as
the
late
rector
seemed
to
suppose
it
was
mrs
morgan
at
length
who
took
heart
to
explain
to
mr
proctor
the
real
state
of
affairs
he
has
been
a
very
good
clergyman
for
five
years
said
mrs
morgan
he
might
behave
foolishly
you
know
about
wharfside
but
then
that
was
not
his
fault
so
much
as
the
fault
of
the
rector
predecessors
i
am
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
proctor
i
did
not
mean
that
you
were
to
blame
said
the
rector
wife
but
notwithstanding
all
the
work
he
has
done
and
the
consistent
life
he
has
led
there
is
nobody
in
carlingford
who
is
not
quite
ready
to
believe
that
he
has
run
away
with
rosa
elsworthy
a
common
little
girl
without
any
education
or
a
single
idea
in
her
head
i
suppose
she
is
what
you
would
call
pretty
said
the
indignant
woman
everybody
is
just
as
ready
to
believe
that
he
is
guilty
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
or
a
bad
character
mrs
morgan
stopped
in
an
abrupt
manner
because
her
quick
eyes
perceived
a
glance
exchanged
between
the
two
gentlemen
mr
proctor
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
world
in
his
day
as
he
was
fond
of
saying
now
and
then
to
his
intimate
friends
and
he
had
learned
at
the
university
and
other
places
that
a
girl
who
is
what
you
would
call
pretty
counts
for
a
great
deal
in
the
history
of
a
young
man
whether
she
has
any
ideas
in
her
head
or
not
he
did
not
any
more
than
the
people
of
carlingford
pronounce
at
once
on
evidence
that
mr
wentworth
must
be
innocent
the
curate
consistent
life
did
not
go
for
much
in
the
opinion
of
the
fellow
of
any
more
than
of
the
less
dignified
populace
he
said
dear
me
dear
me
in
a
most
perplexed
and
distressed
tone
while
mrs
morgan
kept
looking
at
him
and
looked
very
much
as
if
he
were
tempted
to
break
forth
into
lamentations
over
human
nature
as
mr
morgan
himself
had
done
i
wonder
what
the
miss
wodehouses
think
of
it
he
said
at
last
one
would
do
a
great
deal
to
keep
them
from
hearing
such
a
thing
but
i
wonder
how
they
are
feeling
about
it
said
mr
proctor
and
clearly
declined
to
discuss
the
matter
with
mrs
morgan
who
was
counsel
for
the
defence
when
the
rector
wife
went
to
her
own
room
to
dress
for
dinner
it
is
very
true
that
she
had
a
good
cry
over
her
cup
of
tea
she
was
not
only
disappointed
but
exasperated
in
that
impatient
feminine
nature
of
hers
perhaps
if
she
had
been
less
sensitive
she
would
have
had
less
of
that
redness
in
her
face
which
was
so
great
a
trouble
to
mrs
morgan
these
two
slow
men
without
any
intuitions
who
were
coming
lumbering
after
her
through
all
kind
of
muddles
of
evidence
and
argument
exasperated
the
more
rapid
woman
to
be
sure
they
understood
greek
plays
a
great
deal
better
than
she
did
but
she
was
penetrated
with
the
liveliest
impatience
of
their
dulness
all
the
same
mrs
morgan
however
like
most
people
who
are
in
advance
of
their
age
felt
her
utter
impotence
against
that
blank
wall
of
dull
resistance
she
could
not
make
them
see
into
the
heart
of
things
as
she
did
she
had
to
wait
until
they
had
attacked
the
question
in
the
orthodox
way
of
siege
and
made
gradual
entrance
by
dint
of
hard
labour
all
she
could
do
to
console
herself
was
to
shed
certain
hot
tears
of
indignation
and
annoyance
over
her
tea
which
however
was
excellent
tea
and
did
her
good
perhaps
it
was
to
show
her
sense
of
superiority
and
that
she
did
not
feel
herself
vanquished
that
after
that
she
put
on
her
new
dress
which
was
very
much
too
nice
to
be
wasted
upon
mr
proctor
as
for
mr
leeson
who
came
in
as
usual
just
in
time
for
dinner
having
heard
of
mr
proctor
arrival
she
treated
him
with
a
blandness
which
alarmed
the
curate
i
quite
expected
you
for
we
have
the
pudding
said
the
rector
wife
and
she
smiled
a
smile
which
would
have
struck
awe
into
the
soul
of
any
curate
that
ever
was
known
in
carlingford
chapter
xxxii
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
on
which
mr
proctor
arrived
in
carlingford
that
mr
wentworth
received
the
little
note
from
miss
wodehouse
which
was
so
great
a
consolation
to
the
perpetual
curate
by
that
time
he
had
begun
to
experience
humiliations
more
hard
to
bear
than
anything
he
had
yet
known
he
had
received
constrained
greetings
from
several
of
his
most
cordial
friends
his
people
in
the
district
all
but
tom
burrows
looked
askance
upon
him
and
dr
marjoribanks
who
had
never
taken
kindly
to
the
young
anglican
had
met
him
with
satirical
remarks
in
his
dry
scotch
fashion
which
were
intolerable
to
the
curate
in
these
circumstances
it
was
balm
to
his
soul
to
have
his
sympathy
once
more
appealed
to
and
by
those
who
were
nearest
to
his
heart
the
next
day
was
that
appointed
for
mr
wodehouse
funeral
to
which
mr
wentworth
had
been
looking
forward
with
a
little
excitement
wondering
with
indignant
misery
whether
the
covert
insults
he
was
getting
used
to
would
be
repeated
even
over
his
old
friend
grave
it
was
while
this
was
in
his
mind
that
he
received
miss
wodehouse
little
note
it
was
very
hurriedly
written
on
the
terrible
paper
which
to
such
a
simple
soul
as
miss
wodehouse
it
was
a
kind
of
comfort
to
use
in
the
moment
of
calamity
dear
mr
wentworth
it
said
i
am
in
great
difficulty
and
do
know
what
to
do
come
i
beg
of
you
and
tell
me
what
is
best
my
dear
lucy
insists
upon
going
and
i
cross
her
when
her
heart
is
breaking
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
please
to
come
if
it
were
only
for
a
moment
dear
dear
papa
and
all
of
us
have
always
had
such
confidence
in
you
mr
wentworth
was
seated
very
disconsolate
in
his
study
when
this
appeal
came
to
him
he
was
rather
sick
of
the
world
and
most
things
in
it
a
sense
of
wrong
eclipsed
the
sunshine
for
the
moment
and
obscured
the
skies
but
it
was
comforting
to
be
appealed
to
to
have
his
assistance
and
his
protection
sought
once
more
he
took
his
hat
immediately
and
went
up
the
sunny
road
on
which
there
was
scarcely
a
passenger
visible
to
the
house
which
stood
so
gloomy
and
irresponsive
in
the
sunshine
mr
wodehouse
had
not
been
a
man
likely
to
attract
any
profound
love
in
his
lifetime
or
sense
of
loss
when
he
was
gone
but
yet
it
was
possible
to
think
with
the
kindly
delusion
of
nature
that
had
been
living
he
would
have
known
better
and
the
curate
went
into
the
darkened
where
all
the
shutters
were
closed
except
those
of
the
little
window
in
the
corner
where
lucy
stood
and
where
a
little
muffled
sunshine
stole
in
through
the
blind
everything
was
in
terribly
good
order
in
the
room
the
two
sisters
had
been
living
in
their
own
apartments
taking
their
forlorn
meals
in
the
little
parlour
which
communicated
with
their
sleeping
chambers
during
this
week
of
darkness
and
nobody
had
come
into
the
except
the
stealthy
housemaid
who
contemplated
herself
and
her
new
mourning
for
an
hour
at
a
stretch
in
the
great
mirror
without
any
interruption
while
she
made
tidy
the
furniture
which
nobody
now
disturbed
into
this
sombre
apartment
miss
wodehouse
came
gliding
like
a
gentle
ghost
in
her
black
gown
she
too
like
john
and
the
housemaid
and
everybody
about
walked
and
talked
under
her
breath
there
was
now
no
man
in
the
house
entitled
to
disturb
those
proprieties
with
which
a
female
household
naturally
hedges
round
all
the
great
incidents
of
life
and
the
affairs
of
the
family
were
all
carried
on
in
a
whisper
in
accordance
with
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
a
circumstance
which
had
naturally
called
the
ghost
of
a
smile
to
the
curate
countenance
as
he
followed
john
miss
wodehouse
herself
though
she
was
pale
and
spent
half
her
time
poor
soul
in
weeping
and
had
besides
living
encumbrances
to
trouble
her
helpless
path
did
not
look
amiss
in
her
black
gown
she
came
in
gliding
without
any
noise
but
with
a
little
expectation
in
her
gentle
countenance
she
was
one
of
the
people
whom
experience
never
makes
any
wiser
and
she
could
not
help
hoping
to
be
delivered
from
her
troubles
this
time
as
so
often
before
as
soon
as
she
should
have
transferred
them
to
somebody
else
shoulders
and
taken
advice
lucy
has
made
up
her
mind
that
we
are
to
go
said
miss
wodehouse
drying
her
tears
it
was
not
the
custom
in
my
young
days
mr
wentworth
and
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
to
say
but
i
ca
bear
to
cross
her
now
that
she
has
nobody
but
me
she
was
always
the
best
child
in
the
world
said
the
poor
lady
far
more
comfort
to
poor
dear
papa
than
i
ever
could
be
but
to
hear
her
talk
you
would
think
that
she
had
never
done
anything
and
oh
mr
wentworth
if
that
was
all
i
should
not
mind
but
we
have
always
kept
things
a
secret
from
her
and
now
i
have
had
a
letter
and
i
do
know
what
it
is
possible
to
do
a
letter
from
your
brother
asked
mr
wentworth
eagerly
from
tom
said
the
elder
sister
poor
poor
tom
i
am
sure
papa
forgave
him
at
the
last
though
he
did
not
say
anything
oh
mr
wentworth
he
was
such
a
nice
boy
once
and
if
lucy
only
knew
and
i
could
summon
up
the
courage
to
tell
her
and
he
would
change
his
ways
as
he
promised
do
think
me
fickle
or
changeable
or
look
as
if
i
did
know
my
own
mind
cried
poor
miss
wodehouse
with
a
fresh
flow
of
tears
but
oh
mr
wentworth
if
he
only
would
change
his
ways
as
he
promised
think
what
a
comfort
it
would
be
to
us
to
have
him
at
home
yes
said
the
curate
with
a
little
bitterness
here
was
another
instance
of
the
impunities
of
wickedness
i
think
it
very
likely
indeed
that
you
will
have
him
at
home
said
mr
wentworth
almost
certain
the
wonder
is
that
he
went
away
will
you
tell
me
where
he
dates
his
letter
from
i
have
a
curiosity
to
know
you
are
angry
said
the
anxious
sister
oh
mr
wentworth
i
know
he
does
not
deserve
anything
else
but
you
have
always
been
so
kind
i
put
his
letter
in
my
pocket
to
show
you
at
least
i
am
sure
i
intended
to
put
it
in
my
pocket
we
have
scarcely
been
in
this
room
since
since
and
here
miss
wodehouse
broke
down
and
had
to
take
a
little
time
to
recover
i
will
go
and
get
the
letter
she
said
as
at
last
she
regained
her
voice
and
hurried
away
through
the
partial
darkness
with
her
noiseless
step
and
the
long
black
garments
which
swept
noiselessly
over
the
carpet
mr
wentworth
for
his
part
went
to
the
one
window
which
was
only
veiled
by
a
blind
and
comforted
himself
a
little
in
the
sunshine
the
death
atmosphere
weighed
upon
the
young
man
and
took
away
his
courage
if
he
was
only
wanted
to
pave
the
way
for
the
reception
of
the
rascally
brother
for
whose
sins
he
felt
convinced
he
was
himself
suffering
the
consolation
of
being
appealed
to
would
be
sensibly
lessened
and
it
was
hard
to
have
no
other
way
of
clearing
himself
than
by
criminating
lucy
brother
and
bringing
dishonour
upon
her
name
while
he
waited
for
miss
wodehouse
return
he
stood
by
lucy
table
with
very
little
of
the
feeling
which
had
once
prompted
him
to
fold
his
arms
so
caressingly
with
an
impulse
of
tenderness
upon
the
chair
which
stood
beside
it
he
was
so
much
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
that
he
did
not
hear
at
first
the
sound
of
a
hesitating
hand
upon
the
door
which
at
length
when
repeated
went
to
the
curate
heart
he
turned
round
rapidly
and
saw
lucy
standing
on
the
threshold
in
her
profound
mourning
she
was
very
pale
and
her
blue
eyes
looked
large
and
full
beyond
their
natural
appearance
dilated
with
tears
and
watching
and
when
they
met
those
of
mr
wentworth
they
filled
full
like
with
dew
but
besides
this
lucy
made
no
demonstration
of
her
grief
after
that
momentary
hesitation
at
the
door
she
came
in
and
gave
the
curate
her
hand
perhaps
it
was
a
kind
of
defiance
perhaps
a
natural
yearning
which
drew
her
out
of
her
chamber
when
she
heard
of
his
presence
both
sentiments
sprang
out
of
the
same
feeling
and
the
curate
when
he
looked
at
her
bethought
himself
of
the
only
moment
when
he
had
been
able
to
imagine
that
lucy
loved
him
that
moment
by
her
bedside
of
which
the
impression
had
been
dulled
since
then
by
a
crowd
of
events
when
she
looked
with
such
reproach
and
disappointment
and
indignation
into
his
face
i
heard
you
were
here
said
lucy
and
i
thought
you
might
think
it
strange
not
to
see
us
both
and
then
she
paused
perhaps
finding
it
less
easy
than
she
thought
to
explain
why
she
had
come
we
ought
to
thank
you
mr
wentworth
for
your
kindness
though
i
you
were
angry
with
me
said
the
curate
i
know
you
thought
me
heartless
but
a
man
must
bear
to
be
misconceived
when
he
has
duty
to
do
the
young
clergyman
added
with
a
swelling
heart
lucy
did
not
know
the
fuller
significance
of
his
words
and
there
was
a
loftiness
in
them
which
partly
affronted
her
and
set
all
her
sensitive
in
arms
against
him
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
faltering
and
then
the
two
stood
beside
each
other
in
silence
with
a
sense
of
estrangement
as
for
lucy
all
the
story
about
rosa
elsworthy
of
which
she
had
not
yet
heard
the
last
chapter
rushed
back
upon
her
mind
was
it
to
see
little
rosa
lover
that
she
had
come
out
of
the
darkness
of
her
room
with
a
natural
longing
for
sympathy
which
it
was
impossible
to
restrain
the
tenderness
of
the
instinctive
feeling
which
had
moved
her
went
back
upon
her
heart
in
bitterness
that
he
must
have
divined
why
she
had
come
and
scorned
her
for
it
was
the
mildest
supposition
in
lucy
mind
she
could
almost
have
imagined
that
he
had
come
on
purpose
to
elicit
this
vain
exhibition
of
regard
and
triumph
over
it
all
this
too
when
she
was
in
such
great
trouble
and
sorrow
and
wanted
a
little
compassion
a
little
kindness
so
much
this
was
the
state
of
mind
to
which
lucy
had
come
in
five
minutes
after
she
entered
the
room
when
miss
wodehouse
came
back
with
the
letter
the
elder
sister
was
almost
as
much
astonished
at
lucy
presence
as
if
she
had
been
the
dead
inhabitant
who
kept
such
state
in
the
darkened
house
she
was
so
startled
that
she
went
back
a
step
or
two
when
she
perceived
her
and
hastily
put
the
letter
in
her
pocket
and
exclaimed
her
sister
name
in
a
tone
most
unlike
miss
wodehouse
natural
voice
i
came
because
i
mean
they
told
me
mr
wentworth
was
here
said
lucy
who
had
never
felt
so
weak
and
so
miserable
in
her
life
and
i
wanted
to
thank
him
for
all
his
kindness
it
was
here
for
the
first
time
that
lucy
broke
down
her
sorrow
was
so
great
her
longing
for
a
word
of
kindness
had
been
so
natural
and
her
shame
and
at
the
very
thought
that
she
was
able
to
think
of
anything
but
her
father
were
so
bitter
that
the
poor
girl
forces
weakened
by
watching
were
not
able
to
withstand
them
she
sank
into
the
chair
that
stood
nearest
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
cried
as
people
cry
only
at
twenty
and
as
for
mr
wentworth
he
had
no
right
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
comfort
her
nor
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
and
entreat
her
to
take
courage
all
he
could
do
was
to
stand
half
a
yard
yet
a
whole
world
apart
looking
at
her
his
heart
beating
with
all
the
remorseful
tenderness
of
love
since
it
was
not
his
to
console
her
he
was
almost
impatient
of
her
tears
dear
i
have
been
telling
mr
wentworth
about
said
miss
wodehouse
weeping
too
as
was
natural
and
he
thinks
he
thinks
oh
my
darling
and
so
do
i
that
it
will
be
too
much
for
you
when
i
was
young
it
never
was
the
custom
and
oh
lucy
remember
that
ladies
are
not
to
be
expected
to
have
such
command
over
their
feelings
said
poor
miss
wodehouse
dropping
on
her
knees
by
lucy
chair
mr
wentworth
stood
looking
on
in
a
kind
of
despair
he
had
nothing
to
say
and
no
right
to
say
anything
even
his
presence
was
a
kind
of
intrusion
but
to
be
referred
to
thus
as
an
authority
against
lucy
wishes
vexed
him
in
the
most
unreasonable
way
mr
wentworth
does
not
know
me
said
lucy
under
her
breath
wiping
away
her
tears
with
a
trembling
indignant
hand
if
we
had
had
a
brother
it
might
have
been
different
but
there
must
be
somebody
there
that
loves
him
said
the
poor
girl
with
a
sob
getting
up
hastily
from
her
chair
she
could
not
bear
to
stay
any
longer
in
the
room
which
she
had
entered
with
a
vague
sense
of
possible
consolation
as
for
the
curate
he
made
haste
to
open
the
door
for
her
feeling
the
restraint
of
his
position
almost
intolerable
shall
be
there
he
said
stopping
at
the
door
to
look
into
the
fair
pallid
face
which
lucy
would
scarcely
raise
to
listen
could
you
not
trust
it
looked
like
giving
him
a
pledge
of
something
sacred
and
precious
to
put
her
hand
into
his
which
was
held
out
for
it
so
eagerly
but
lucy
could
not
resist
the
softening
of
nature
and
not
even
miss
wodehouse
looking
anxiously
after
them
heard
what
further
words
they
were
that
mr
wentworth
said
in
her
ear
i
am
for
your
service
however
and
wherever
you
want
me
said
the
curate
with
a
young
man
absolutism
heaven
knows
he
had
enough
to
do
with
his
own
troubles
but
he
remembered
no
obstacle
which
could
prevent
him
from
dedicating
all
his
time
and
life
to
her
as
he
spoke
when
lucy
reached
her
own
room
she
threw
herself
upon
the
sofa
and
wept
like
a
woman
inconsolable
but
it
was
somehow
because
this
consolation
subtle
and
secret
had
stolen
into
her
heart
that
her
tears
flowed
so
freely
and
mr
wentworth
returned
to
her
sister
relieved
he
could
not
have
told
why
at
all
events
come
what
might
the
two
had
drawn
together
again
in
their
mutual
need
oh
mr
wentworth
how
can
i
cross
her
said
miss
wodehouse
wringing
her
hands
if
we
had
a
brother
did
you
hear
what
she
said
here
is
his
letter
and
i
hope
you
will
tell
me
candidly
what
you
think
if
we
could
trust
him
if
we
could
but
trust
him
i
daresay
you
think
me
very
changeable
and
foolish
but
now
we
are
alone
said
the
poor
lady
think
what
a
comfort
it
would
be
if
he
only
would
change
his
ways
as
he
promised
lucy
is
a
great
deal
more
use
than
i
am
and
understands
things
but
still
we
are
only
two
women
said
the
elder
sister
if
you
think
we
could
put
any
dependence
upon
him
mr
wentworth
i
would
never
hesitate
he
might
live
with
us
and
have
his
little
allowance
miss
wodehouse
paused
and
raised
her
anxious
face
to
the
curate
pondering
the
particulars
of
the
liberality
she
intended
he
is
not
a
boy
she
went
on
i
daresay
now
he
must
feel
the
want
of
the
little
comforts
he
once
was
used
to
and
though
he
is
not
like
what
he
used
to
be
neither
in
his
looks
nor
his
manners
people
would
be
kind
to
him
for
our
sakes
oh
mr
wentworth
do
you
think
we
might
trust
him
said
the
anxious
woman
looking
in
the
curate
face
all
this
time
mr
wentworth
with
an
impatience
of
her
simplicity
which
it
was
difficult
to
restrain
was
reading
the
letter
in
which
he
perceived
a
very
different
intention
from
any
divined
by
miss
wodehouse
the
billet
was
disreputable
enough
written
in
pencil
and
without
any
date
mary
i
mean
to
come
to
my
father
funeral
wrote
mr
disowned
son
things
are
changed
now
as
i
said
they
would
be
i
and
a
friend
of
mine
have
set
everything
straight
with
waters
and
i
mean
to
come
in
my
own
name
and
take
the
place
i
have
a
right
to
how
it
is
to
be
after
this
depends
on
how
you
behave
but
things
are
changed
between
you
and
me
as
i
told
you
they
would
be
and
i
expect
you
wo
do
anything
to
make
worse
by
doing
or
saying
unpleasant
i
add
no
more
because
i
hope
you
have
sense
to
see
what
i
mean
and
to
act
your
brother
thomas
wodehouse
you
see
he
thinks
i
will
reproach
him
said
miss
wodehouse
anxiously
perhaps
it
had
just
glanced
across
her
own
mind
that
something
more
important
still
might
have
dictated
language
so
decided
he
has
a
great
deal
more
feeling
than
you
would
suppose
poor
fellow
it
is
very
touching
in
him
to
say
place
he
has
a
right
to
do
you
think
so
mr
wentworth
poor
tom
if
we
could
but
trust
him
and
he
would
change
his
ways
as
he
promised
oh
mr
wentworth
do
you
think
i
might
speak
of
it
to
him
if
we
could
bury
everything
in
dear
papa
grave
cried
the
poor
lady
once
more
breaking
down
mr
wentworth
took
no
notice
of
miss
wodehouse
tears
they
moved
him
with
sentiments
entirely
different
from
those
with
which
he
regarded
lucy
he
read
the
note
over
again
without
any
attempt
to
console
her
till
she
had
struggled
back
into
composure
but
even
then
there
was
nothing
sympathetic
in
the
voice
and
i
think
you
told
me
you
did
not
know
anything
about
the
will
he
said
with
some
abruptness
making
no
account
whatever
of
the
suggestion
she
had
made
no
said
miss
wodehouse
but
my
dear
father
was
a
business
man
mr
wentworth
and
i
feel
quite
sure
quite
yes
said
the
perpetual
curate
nor
of
the
nature
of
his
property
perhaps
added
the
young
man
whom
poor
miss
wodehouse
had
chosen
for
her
adviser
it
was
more
than
the
gentle
woman
could
bear
oh
mr
wentworth
you
know
i
am
not
one
to
understand
cried
the
poor
lady
you
ask
me
questions
but
you
never
tell
me
what
you
think
i
should
do
if
it
were
only
for
myself
i
would
not
mind
but
i
have
to
act
for
lucy
said
the
elder
sister
suddenly
sitting
upright
and
drying
her
tears
papa
i
am
sure
did
what
was
best
for
us
she
said
with
a
little
gentle
dignity
which
brought
the
curate
back
to
his
senses
but
oh
mr
wentworth
look
at
the
letter
and
tell
me
for
my
sister
sake
what
am
i
to
do
the
curate
went
to
the
window
from
which
the
sunshine
was
stealing
away
to
consider
the
subject
but
he
did
not
seem
to
derive
much
additional
wisdom
from
that
sacred
spot
where
lucy
stood
idle
we
must
wait
and
see
he
said
to
himself
when
he
came
back
to
miss
wodehouse
and
saw
the
question
still
in
her
eyes
it
only
brought
back
his
impatience
my
dear
miss
wodehouse
instead
of
speculating
about
what
is
to
happen
it
would
be
much
better
to
prepare
your
sister
for
the
discovery
she
must
make
said
mr
wentworth
i
can
not
give
any
other
advice
for
my
part
i
think
it
is
a
great
pity
that
you
have
kept
it
concealed
so
long
i
beg
your
pardon
for
speaking
so
abruptly
but
i
am
afraid
you
do
know
all
the
trouble
that
is
before
you
we
are
all
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble
said
the
perpetual
curate
with
a
little
unconscious
solemnity
i
ca
say
i
see
my
way
through
it
but
you
ought
to
prepare
her
to
see
her
brother
he
said
the
words
with
a
degree
of
repugnance
which
he
could
not
conceal
and
which
wounded
his
companion
tender
heart
he
was
so
different
when
he
was
young
said
miss
wodehouse
with
a
suppressed
sob
he
was
a
favourite
everywhere
you
would
not
have
looked
so
if
you
had
known
him
then
oh
mr
wentworth
promise
me
that
you
will
not
turn
your
back
upon
him
if
he
comes
home
after
all
your
kindness
i
will
tell
lucy
how
much
you
have
done
for
him
said
miss
wodehouse
she
was
only
of
her
own
gentle
artifice
she
took
the
curate
hand
in
both
her
own
before
he
left
her
and
said
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
have
his
advice
to
rely
upon
and
she
believed
what
she
said
though
mr
wentworth
himself
knew
better
the
poor
lady
sat
down
in
lucy
chair
and
had
a
cry
at
her
ease
after
he
went
away
she
was
to
tell
lucy
but
how
and
she
sat
pondering
this
hard
question
till
all
the
light
had
faded
out
of
the
room
and
the
little
window
which
was
not
shuttered
dispersed
only
a
grey
twilight
through
the
empty
place
the
lamp
meantime
had
been
lighted
in
the
little
parlour
where
lucy
sat
very
sad
in
her
black
dress
with
memoriam
on
the
table
by
her
carrying
on
a
similar
strain
in
her
heart
she
was
thinking
of
the
past
so
many
broken
scenes
of
which
kept
flashing
up
before
her
all
bright
with
indulgent
love
and
tenderness
and
she
was
thinking
of
the
next
day
when
she
was
to
see
all
that
remained
of
her
good
father
laid
in
his
grave
he
was
not
very
wise
nor
remarkable
among
men
but
he
had
been
the
tenderest
father
to
the
child
of
his
old
age
and
in
her
heart
she
was
praying
for
him
still
pausing
now
and
then
to
think
whether
it
was
right
the
tears
were
heavy
in
her
young
eyes
but
they
were
natural
tears
and
lucy
had
no
more
thought
that
there
was
in
the
world
anything
sadder
than
sorrow
or
that
any
complications
lay
in
her
individual
lot
than
the
merest
child
in
prickett
lane
she
thought
of
going
back
to
the
district
all
robed
and
invested
in
the
sanctity
of
her
grief
she
thought
it
was
to
last
for
ever
as
one
has
the
privilege
of
thinking
when
one
is
young
and
it
was
to
this
young
saint
tender
towards
all
the
world
ready
to
pity
everybody
and
to
save
a
whole
race
if
that
had
been
possible
that
miss
wodehouse
went
in
heavy
and
burdened
with
her
tale
of
miserable
vice
unkindness
estrangement
how
was
it
possible
to
begin
instead
of
beginning
poor
miss
wodehouse
overpowered
by
her
anxieties
and
responsibilities
was
taken
ill
and
fainted
and
had
to
be
carried
to
bed
lucy
would
not
let
her
talk
when
she
came
to
herself
and
so
the
only
moment
of
possible
preparation
passed
away
and
the
event
itself
which
one
of
them
knew
nothing
of
and
the
other
did
not
understand
came
in
its
own
person
without
any
to
open
lucy
eyes
once
for
all
chapter
xxxiii
mr
wentworth
had
to
go
into
carlingford
on
some
business
when
he
left
miss
wodehouse
and
as
he
went
home
again
having
his
head
full
of
so
many
matters
he
forgot
for
the
moment
what
most
immediately
concerned
himself
and
was
close
upon
elsworthy
shop
looking
into
the
window
before
he
thought
of
it
elsworthy
himself
was
standing
behind
the
counter
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
from
which
he
was
expounding
something
to
various
people
in
the
shop
it
was
getting
late
and
the
gas
was
lighted
which
threw
the
interior
into
very
bright
relief
to
mr
wentworth
outside
the
curate
was
still
only
a
young
man
though
he
was
a
clergyman
and
his
movements
were
not
always
guided
by
reason
or
sound
sense
he
walked
into
the
shop
almost
before
he
was
aware
what
he
was
doing
the
people
were
inconsiderable
people
enough
cronies
of
elsworthy
but
they
were
people
who
had
been
accustomed
to
look
up
very
reverentially
to
the
curate
of
st
roque
and
mr
wentworth
was
far
from
being
superior
to
their
disapproval
there
was
a
very
visible
stir
among
them
as
he
entered
and
elsworthy
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
in
his
elucidations
and
thrust
the
paper
he
had
been
reading
into
a
drawer
dead
and
sudden
silence
followed
the
entrance
of
the
curate
peter
hayles
the
druggist
who
was
one
of
the
auditors
stole
to
the
door
with
intentions
of
escape
and
the
women
of
whom
there
were
two
or
three
looked
alarmed
not
knowing
what
might
come
of
it
as
for
mr
wentworth
there
was
only
one
thing
possible
for
him
to
say
have
you
heard
anything
of
rosa
elsworthy
he
asked
with
great
gravity
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
man
face
the
question
seemed
to
ring
into
all
the
corners
whether
it
was
innocence
or
utter
abandonment
nobody
could
tell
and
the
spectators
held
their
breath
for
the
answer
elsworthy
for
his
part
was
as
much
taken
by
surprise
as
his
neighbours
he
grew
very
pale
and
livid
in
his
sudden
excitement
and
lost
his
voice
and
stood
staring
at
the
curate
like
a
man
struck
dumb
perhaps
mr
wentworth
got
bolder
when
he
saw
the
effect
he
had
produced
he
repeated
the
question
looking
towards
poor
mrs
elsworthy
who
had
jumped
from
her
husband
side
when
he
came
in
the
whole
party
looked
like
startled
conspirators
to
mr
wentworth
eyes
though
he
had
not
the
least
idea
what
they
had
been
doing
have
you
heard
anything
of
rosa
he
asked
again
and
everybody
looked
at
elsworthy
as
if
he
were
the
guilty
man
and
had
suborned
the
rest
which
indeed
in
one
sense
was
not
far
from
being
the
case
when
elsworthy
came
to
himself
he
gave
mr
wentworth
a
sidelong
dangerous
look
no
sir
nothing
said
rosa
uncle
them
as
has
hidden
her
has
hidden
her
well
i
did
expect
to
hear
not
yet
said
elsworthy
though
mr
wentworth
did
not
know
what
he
meant
his
little
audience
in
the
shop
did
and
showed
by
the
slightest
murmur
in
the
world
their
conviction
that
the
arrow
had
gone
home
which
naturally
acted
like
a
spur
upon
the
curate
who
was
not
the
wisest
man
in
the
world
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
you
in
so
much
distress
said
the
young
man
looking
at
mrs
elsworthy
red
eyes
but
i
trust
things
will
turn
out
much
better
than
you
imagine
if
i
can
do
anything
to
help
you
let
me
know
said
mr
wentworth
perhaps
it
was
foolish
to
say
so
much
knowing
what
he
did
but
unfortunately
prudence
was
not
the
ruling
principle
at
that
moment
in
the
curate
soul
i
was
of
letting
you
know
sir
said
the
clerk
of
st
roque
with
deadly
meaning
leastways
not
me
but
them
as
has
taken
me
by
the
hand
there
every
prospect
as
it
all
be
known
afore
long
said
elsworthy
pushing
his
wife
aside
and
following
mr
wentworth
with
a
ghastly
caricature
of
his
old
obsequiousness
to
the
door
there
inquiries
made
as
was
never
known
to
fail
for
one
thing
i
written
to
them
as
knows
a
deal
about
the
movements
of
a
party
as
is
suspected
not
to
say
as
i
got
good
friends
said
rosa
guardian
standing
upon
the
step
of
his
own
door
and
watching
the
curate
out
into
the
darkness
mr
wentworth
could
not
altogether
restrain
a
slight
thrill
of
unpleasant
emotion
for
elsworthy
standing
at
his
door
with
the
light
gleaming
over
him
from
behind
and
his
face
invisible
had
an
unpleasant
resemblance
to
a
wild
beast
waiting
for
his
prey
i
am
glad
to
think
you
are
likely
to
be
so
successful
send
me
word
as
soon
as
you
know
said
the
curate
and
he
pursued
his
way
home
afterwards
with
feelings
far
from
pleasant
he
saw
something
was
about
to
come
of
this
more
than
he
had
thought
likely
and
the
crisis
was
approaching
as
he
walked
rapidly
home
he
concluded
within
himself
to
have
a
conversation
with
the
rector
next
day
after
mr
wodehouse
funeral
and
to
ask
for
an
investigation
into
the
whole
matter
when
he
had
come
to
this
conclusion
he
dismissed
the
subject
from
his
mind
as
far
as
was
possible
and
took
to
thinking
of
the
other
matters
which
disturbed
his
repose
in
which
indeed
it
was
very
easy
to
get
perplexed
and
bewildered
to
his
heart
content
anyhow
one
way
and
another
the
day
of
poor
mr
wodehouse
funeral
must
necessarily
be
an
exciting
and
momentous
day
mr
wentworth
had
however
no
idea
that
its
interest
was
to
begin
so
early
when
he
was
seated
at
breakfast
reading
his
letters
a
note
was
brought
to
him
which
coming
in
the
midst
of
a
lively
chronicle
of
home
news
from
his
sister
letty
almost
stopped
for
the
moment
the
beating
of
the
curate
heart
it
took
him
so
utterly
by
surprise
that
more
violent
sentiments
were
lost
for
the
moment
in
mere
wonder
he
read
it
over
twice
before
he
could
make
it
out
it
was
from
the
rector
and
notwithstanding
his
wife
remonstrances
and
his
own
qualms
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
this
was
what
mr
morgan
said
dear
sir
it
is
my
painful
duty
to
let
you
know
that
certain
rumours
have
reached
my
ears
very
prejudicial
to
your
character
as
a
clergyman
and
which
i
understand
to
be
very
generally
current
in
carlingford
such
a
scandal
if
not
properly
dealt
with
is
certain
to
have
an
unfavourable
effect
upon
the
popular
mind
and
injure
the
clergy
in
the
general
estimation
while
it
is
as
i
need
not
point
out
to
you
quite
destructive
of
your
own
usefulness
under
the
circumstances
i
have
thought
it
my
duty
as
rector
of
the
parish
to
take
steps
for
investigating
these
reports
of
course
i
do
not
pretend
to
any
authority
over
you
nor
can
i
enforce
in
any
way
your
participation
in
the
inquiry
or
consent
to
it
but
i
beg
to
urge
upon
you
strongly
as
a
friend
the
advantage
of
assenting
freely
that
your
innocence
if
possible
may
be
made
apparent
and
your
character
cleared
i
enclose
the
names
of
the
gentlemen
whose
assistance
i
intend
to
request
for
this
painful
duty
in
case
you
should
object
to
any
of
them
and
would
again
urge
you
your
own
the
expediency
of
concurrence
i
regret
to
say
that
though
i
would
not
willingly
prejudge
any
man
much
less
a
brother
clergyman
i
do
not
feel
that
it
would
be
seemly
on
my
part
under
the
circumstances
to
avail
myself
of
your
assistance
today
in
the
for
the
late
mr
believe
me
very
sincerely
yours
w
morgan
when
mr
wentworth
looked
up
from
this
letter
he
caught
sight
of
his
face
in
the
mirror
opposite
and
gazed
into
his
own
eyes
like
a
man
stupefied
he
had
not
been
without
vexations
in
years
of
a
not
uneventful
life
but
he
had
never
known
anything
like
the
misery
of
that
moment
it
was
nearly
four
hours
later
when
he
walked
slowly
up
grange
lane
to
the
house
which
before
night
might
own
so
different
a
master
but
he
had
found
as
yet
no
time
to
spare
for
the
wodehouses
even
for
lucy
in
the
thoughts
which
were
all
occupied
by
the
blow
nobody
could
tell
not
even
himself
the
mental
discipline
he
had
gone
through
before
he
emerged
rather
stern
but
perfectly
calm
in
the
sunshine
in
front
of
the
house
if
it
was
not
his
to
meet
the
solemn
passenger
at
the
gates
with
words
of
hope
at
least
he
could
do
a
man
part
to
the
helpless
who
had
still
to
live
but
the
blow
was
cruel
and
all
the
force
of
his
nature
was
necessary
to
sustain
it
all
carlingford
knew
by
the
evidence
of
its
senses
that
mr
wentworth
had
been
a
daily
visitor
of
the
dead
and
one
of
his
most
intimate
friends
and
nobody
had
doubted
for
a
moment
that
to
him
would
be
assigned
as
great
a
portion
of
the
service
as
his
feelings
permitted
him
to
undertake
when
the
bystanders
saw
him
join
the
procession
a
thrill
of
surprise
ran
through
the
crowd
but
nobody
not
even
the
man
who
walked
beside
him
ventured
to
trifle
with
the
curate
face
so
far
as
to
ask
why
the
grand
inquisitor
himself
if
such
a
mythical
personage
exists
any
longer
could
not
have
invented
a
more
delicate
torture
than
that
which
the
respectable
and
rector
of
carlingford
inflicted
calmly
without
knowing
it
upon
the
curate
of
st
roque
how
was
mr
morgan
to
know
that
the
sting
would
go
to
his
heart
a
perpetual
curate
without
a
district
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
heart
so
sensitive
the
rector
put
on
his
own
robes
with
a
peaceful
mind
feeling
that
he
had
done
his
duty
and
with
mr
leeson
behind
him
came
to
the
church
door
with
great
solemnity
to
meet
the
procession
he
read
the
words
which
are
so
sweet
and
so
terrible
with
his
usual
voice
as
he
read
the
invitations
every
sunday
he
was
a
good
man
but
he
was
and
not
accessible
to
impression
from
the
mere
aspect
of
death
and
he
did
not
know
mr
wodehouse
nor
care
much
for
anything
in
the
matter
except
his
own
virtue
in
excluding
the
perpetual
curate
from
any
share
in
the
service
such
was
the
rector
feeling
in
respect
to
this
funeral
which
made
so
much
commotion
in
carlingford
he
felt
that
he
was
vindicating
the
purity
of
his
profession
as
he
threaded
his
way
through
the
pathetic
hillocks
where
the
nameless
people
were
lying
to
poor
mr
wodehouse
grave
this
however
was
not
the
only
thing
which
aroused
the
wonder
and
interest
of
the
townspeople
when
the
two
shrinking
hooded
female
figures
all
black
and
unrecognisable
rose
up
trembling
to
follow
their
dead
from
the
church
to
the
grave
everybody
saw
with
wonder
that
their
place
was
contested
and
that
somebody
else
a
man
whom
no
one
knew
thrust
himself
before
them
and
walked
alone
in
the
chief
place
as
for
lucy
who
through
her
veil
and
her
tears
saw
nothing
distinctly
this
figure
which
she
did
not
know
struck
her
only
with
a
vague
astonishment
if
she
thought
of
it
at
all
she
thought
it
a
mistake
simple
enough
though
a
little
startling
and
went
on
doing
all
she
could
to
support
her
sister
saying
broken
prayers
in
her
heart
and
far
too
much
absorbed
in
the
duty
she
was
performing
to
think
who
was
looking
on
or
to
be
conscious
of
any
of
the
attending
circumstances
except
mr
morgan
voice
which
was
not
the
voice
she
had
expected
to
hear
miss
wodehouse
was
a
great
deal
more
agitated
than
lucy
she
knew
very
well
who
it
was
that
placed
himself
before
her
asserting
his
own
right
without
offering
any
help
to
his
sisters
and
vague
apprehensions
which
she
herself
could
not
understand
came
over
her
just
at
the
moment
when
she
required
her
strength
most
as
there
were
no
other
relations
present
the
place
of
honour
next
to
the
two
ladies
had
been
tacitly
conceded
to
mr
proctor
and
mr
wentworth
and
it
was
thus
that
the
curate
rendered
the
last
service
to
his
old
friend
it
was
a
strange
procession
and
concentrated
in
itself
all
that
was
most
exciting
in
carlingford
at
the
moment
everybody
observed
and
commented
upon
the
strange
man
who
all
remarkable
and
unknown
with
his
great
beard
and
sullen
countenance
walked
by
himself
as
chief
mourner
who
was
he
and
whispers
arose
and
ran
through
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
of
the
most
incredible
description
some
said
he
was
an
illegitimate
son
whom
mr
wodehouse
had
left
all
his
property
to
but
whom
the
ladies
knew
nothing
of
some
that
it
was
a
strange
cousin
whom
lucy
was
to
be
compelled
to
marry
or
lose
her
share
and
after
a
while
people
compared
notes
and
went
back
upon
their
recollections
and
began
to
ask
each
other
if
it
was
true
that
tom
wodehouse
died
twenty
years
ago
in
the
west
indies
then
behind
the
two
ladies
poor
ladies
whose
fate
was
hanging
in
the
balance
though
they
did
not
know
it
came
mr
wentworth
in
his
cap
and
gown
pale
and
stern
as
nobody
ever
had
seen
him
before
in
carlingford
excluded
from
all
share
in
the
service
which
mr
leeson
in
a
flutter
of
surplice
and
solemnity
was
giving
his
valuable
assistance
in
the
churchyard
at
carlingford
had
not
lost
its
air
though
the
town
had
increased
so
much
for
the
district
was
very
healthy
as
everybody
knows
and
people
did
not
die
before
their
time
as
in
places
less
favoured
the
townspeople
who
knew
mr
wodehouse
so
well
lingered
all
about
among
the
graves
looking
with
neighbourly
calm
regret
but
the
liveliest
curiosity
most
of
the
shopkeepers
at
that
end
of
george
street
had
closed
their
shops
on
the
mournful
occasion
and
felt
themselves
repaid
as
for
elsworthy
he
stood
with
a
group
of
supporters
round
him
as
near
as
possible
to
the
funeral
procession
and
farther
off
in
the
distance
under
the
trees
was
a
much
more
elegant
spectator
an
unlikely
man
enough
to
assist
at
such
a
spectacle
being
no
less
a
person
than
jack
wentworth
in
the
perfection
of
an
english
gentleman
morning
apparel
perfectly
at
his
ease
and
indifferent
yet
listening
with
close
attention
to
all
the
scraps
of
talk
that
came
in
his
way
the
centre
of
all
this
wondering
curious
crowd
where
so
many
passions
and
emotions
and
schemes
and
purposes
were
in
full
tide
and
life
was
beating
so
strong
and
vehement
was
the
harmless
dead
under
the
heavy
pall
which
did
not
veil
him
so
entirely
from
the
living
as
did
the
hopes
and
fears
and
curious
speculations
which
had
already
sprung
up
over
him
filling
up
his
place
among
the
whole
assembly
there
was
not
one
heart
really
occupied
by
thoughts
of
him
except
that
of
poor
lucy
who
knew
nothing
of
all
the
absorbing
anxieties
and
terrors
that
occupied
the
others
she
had
still
a
moment
leisure
for
her
natural
grief
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
upright
and
support
her
sister
who
had
burdens
to
bear
which
lucy
knew
nothing
of
but
still
concealed
under
her
hood
and
veil
seeing
nothing
but
the
grave
before
her
hearing
nothing
but
the
sacred
words
and
the
terrible
sound
of
dust
to
dust
the
young
creature
stood
steadfast
and
gave
the
dead
man
who
had
loved
her
his
due
last
offering
of
nature
and
love
sweeter
to
anticipate
than
any
honours
nobody
but
his
child
offered
to
poor
mr
wodehouse
that
last
right
of
humanity
or
made
his
grave
sacred
with
natural
tears
when
they
went
back
sadly
out
of
all
that
blinding
sunshine
into
the
darkened
house
it
was
not
all
over
as
poor
lucy
had
supposed
she
had
begun
to
come
to
herself
and
understand
once
more
the
looks
of
the
people
about
her
when
the
old
maid
who
had
been
the
attendant
of
the
sisters
during
all
lucy
life
undid
her
wrappings
and
in
her
agitation
of
the
moment
kissed
her
white
cheek
and
held
her
in
her
arms
oh
miss
lucy
darling
do
take
on
no
more
than
you
can
help
i
sore
sore
afeared
that
there
a
deal
of
trouble
afore
you
yet
said
the
weeping
woman
though
lucy
had
not
the
smallest
possible
clue
to
her
meaning
and
was
almost
too
much
worn
out
to
be
curious
she
could
not
help
a
vague
thrill
of
alarm
what
is
it
alland
she
said
rising
up
from
the
sofa
on
which
she
had
thrown
herself
but
alland
could
do
nothing
but
cry
over
her
nursling
and
console
her
oh
my
poor
dear
oh
my
darling
as
he
never
would
have
let
the
wind
of
heaven
to
blow
rough
upon
her
cried
the
old
servant
and
it
was
just
then
that
miss
wodehouse
who
was
trembling
all
over
hysterically
came
into
the
room
we
have
to
go
said
the
elder
sister
oh
lucy
my
darling
it
was
not
my
fault
at
first
i
should
have
told
you
last
night
to
prepare
you
and
i
had
not
the
heart
mr
wentworth
has
told
me
so
often
mr
wentworth
said
lucy
she
rose
up
not
quite
knowing
where
she
was
aware
of
nothing
except
that
some
sudden
calamity
under
which
she
was
expected
to
faint
altogether
was
coming
to
her
by
means
of
mr
wentworth
her
mind
jumped
at
the
only
dim
possibility
that
seemed
to
glimmer
through
the
darkness
he
must
be
married
she
supposed
or
about
to
be
married
and
it
was
this
they
insulted
her
by
thinking
that
she
could
not
bear
there
was
not
a
particle
of
colour
in
her
face
before
but
the
blood
rushed
into
it
with
a
bitterness
of
shame
and
rage
which
she
had
never
known
till
now
i
will
go
down
with
you
if
it
is
necessary
said
lucy
but
surely
this
is
a
strange
time
to
talk
of
mr
wentworth
affairs
there
was
no
time
to
explain
anything
farther
for
just
then
old
mrs
western
who
was
a
distant
cousin
knocked
at
the
door
god
help
you
my
poor
dear
children
said
the
old
lady
they
are
all
waiting
for
you
and
it
was
with
this
delusion
in
her
mind
embittering
every
thought
that
lucy
went
into
the
where
they
were
all
assembled
the
madness
of
the
idea
did
not
strike
her
somehow
even
when
she
saw
the
grave
assembly
which
it
was
strange
to
think
could
have
been
brought
together
to
listen
to
any
explanation
from
the
perpetual
curate
he
was
standing
there
prominent
enough
among
them
with
a
certain
air
of
suppressed
passion
in
his
face
which
lucy
divined
almost
without
seeing
it
for
her
own
part
she
went
in
with
perfect
firmness
supporting
her
sister
whose
trembling
was
painful
to
see
there
was
no
other
lady
in
the
room
except
old
mrs
western
who
would
not
sit
down
but
hovered
behind
the
chairs
which
had
been
placed
for
the
sisters
near
the
table
at
which
mr
waters
was
standing
by
the
side
of
mr
waters
was
the
man
who
had
been
at
the
funeral
and
whom
nobody
knew
and
a
few
gentlemen
who
were
friends
of
the
family
were
in
the
room
the
rector
by
virtue
of
his
office
and
mr
proctor
and
dr
marjoribanks
and
any
one
whose
attention
was
sufficiently
disengaged
to
note
the
details
of
the
scene
might
have
perceived
john
who
had
been
fifteen
years
with
mr
wodehouse
and
the
old
cook
in
her
black
gown
who
was
of
older
standing
in
the
family
than
alland
herself
peeping
in
whenever
it
was
opened
through
the
door
now
that
the
miss
wodehouses
are
here
we
may
proceed
to
business
said
mr
waters
some
of
the
party
are
already
aware
that
i
have
an
important
communication
to
make
i
am
very
sorry
if
it
comes
abruptly
upon
anybody
specially
interested
my
late
partner
much
respected
though
he
has
always
been
was
a
man
of
peculiar
views
in
many
respects
dr
marjoribanks
will
bear
me
out
in
what
i
say
i
had
been
his
partner
for
ten
years
before
i
found
this
out
highly
important
as
it
will
be
seen
to
be
and
i
believe
mr
wentworth
though
an
intimate
friend
of
the
family
obtained
the
information
by
a
kind
of
accident
the
stranger
muttered
something
in
his
beard
which
nobody
could
hear
and
the
perpetual
curate
interposed
audibly
would
it
not
be
best
to
make
the
explanations
afterwards
said
mr
wentworth
and
he
changed
his
own
position
and
went
over
beside
old
mrs
western
who
was
leaning
upon
lucy
chair
he
put
his
own
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
with
an
involuntary
impulse
as
for
lucy
her
first
thrill
of
nervous
strength
had
failed
her
she
began
to
get
confused
and
bewildered
but
whatever
it
was
no
insult
no
wound
to
her
pride
or
affections
was
coming
to
her
from
that
hand
which
she
knew
was
on
her
chair
she
leaned
back
a
little
with
a
long
sigh
her
imagination
could
not
conceive
anything
important
enough
for
such
a
solemn
intimation
and
her
attention
began
to
flag
in
spite
of
herself
no
doubt
it
was
something
about
that
money
which
people
thought
so
interesting
meanwhile
mr
waters
went
on
steadily
with
what
he
had
to
say
not
sparing
them
a
word
of
the
preamble
and
it
was
not
till
ten
minutes
later
that
lucy
started
up
with
a
sudden
cry
of
incredulity
and
wonder
and
repeated
his
last
words
his
son
whose
son
cried
lucy
she
looked
all
round
her
not
knowing
whom
to
appeal
to
in
her
sudden
consternation
we
never
had
a
brother
said
the
child
of
mr
wodehouse
old
age
it
must
be
some
mistake
there
was
a
dead
pause
after
these
words
when
she
looked
round
again
a
sickening
conviction
came
to
lucy
heart
that
it
was
no
mistake
she
rose
up
without
knowing
it
and
looked
round
upon
all
the
people
who
were
watching
her
with
various
looks
of
pity
and
curiosity
and
mr
waters
had
stopped
speaking
and
the
terrible
stranger
made
a
step
forward
with
an
air
that
identified
him
it
was
at
him
that
mr
proctor
was
staring
who
cleared
his
voice
a
great
many
times
and
came
forward
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looked
as
if
he
meant
to
speak
and
upon
him
every
eye
was
fixed
except
mr
wentworth
who
was
watching
lucy
and
miss
wodehouse
which
were
hidden
in
her
hands
we
never
had
a
brother
she
repeated
faltering
and
then
in
the
extremity
of
her
wonder
and
excitement
lucy
turned
round
without
knowing
it
to
the
man
whom
her
heart
instinctively
appealed
to
is
it
true
she
said
she
held
out
her
hands
to
him
with
a
kind
of
entreaty
not
to
say
so
mr
wentworth
made
no
reply
to
her
question
he
said
only
let
me
take
you
away
it
is
too
much
for
you
bending
down
over
her
without
thinking
what
he
did
and
drawing
her
hand
through
his
arm
she
is
not
able
for
any
more
said
the
curate
hurriedly
afterwards
we
can
explain
to
her
if
he
could
have
remembered
anything
about
himself
at
the
moment
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
denied
himself
the
comfort
of
supporting
lucy
he
a
man
under
ban
but
he
was
thinking
only
of
her
as
he
stood
facing
them
all
with
her
arm
drawn
through
his
upon
which
conjunction
the
rector
and
the
late
rector
looked
with
a
grim
aspect
disposed
to
interfere
but
not
knowing
how
all
this
may
be
very
interesting
to
you
said
the
stranger
out
of
his
beard
if
lucy
do
know
her
brother
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
mr
waters
has
only
said
half
he
has
got
to
say
and
as
for
the
rest
to
sum
it
up
in
words
i
very
glad
to
see
you
in
my
house
gentlemen
and
i
hope
you
will
make
yourselves
at
home
where
nobody
understands
a
man
has
to
speak
plain
i
been
turned
out
all
my
life
and
by
jove
i
do
mean
to
stand
it
any
longer
the
girls
can
have
what
their
father
left
them
said
the
vagabond
in
his
moment
of
triumph
they
aint
my
business
no
more
than
i
was
theirs
the
property
is
freehold
and
waters
is
aware
that
i
the
heir
saying
this
wodehouse
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
and
sat
down
with
emphasis
he
was
the
only
man
seated
in
the
room
and
he
kept
his
place
in
his
sullen
way
amid
the
excited
group
which
gathered
round
him
as
for
miss
wodehouse
some
sense
of
what
had
happened
penetrated
even
her
mind
she
too
rose
up
and
wiped
her
tears
from
her
face
and
looked
round
pale
and
scared
to
the
curate
i
was
thinking
of
speaking
to
lucy
i
meant
to
ask
her
to
take
you
back
tom
said
the
elder
sister
oh
mr
wentworth
tell
me
for
heaven
sake
what
does
it
mean
if
i
had
only
been
permitted
to
explain
said
mr
waters
my
worthy
partner
died
intestate
his
son
is
his
natural
heir
perhaps
we
need
not
detain
the
ladies
longer
now
that
they
understand
it
all
the
rest
can
be
better
arranged
with
their
representative
i
am
very
sorry
to
add
to
their
sufferings
today
said
the
polite
lawyer
opening
the
door
everything
else
can
be
made
the
subject
of
an
arrangement
he
held
the
door
open
with
a
kind
of
civil
coercion
compelling
their
departure
the
familiar
room
they
were
in
no
longer
belonged
to
the
miss
wodehouses
lucy
drew
her
arm
out
of
mr
wentworth
and
took
her
sister
hand
you
will
be
our
representative
she
said
to
him
out
of
the
fulness
of
her
heart
when
the
door
closed
the
perpetual
curate
took
up
his
position
facing
them
all
with
looks
more
lofty
than
belonged
even
to
his
wentworth
blood
they
had
kept
him
from
exercising
his
office
at
his
friend
grave
but
nobody
could
take
from
him
the
still
nobler
duty
of
defending
the
oppressed
chapter
xxxiv
when
the
door
closed
upon
lucy
and
her
sister
mr
wentworth
stood
by
himself
facing
the
other
people
assembled
the
majority
of
them
were
more
surprised
more
shocked
than
he
was
but
they
were
huddled
together
in
their
wonder
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
and
had
somehow
a
confused
air
of
being
on
the
other
side
it
a
very
extraordinary
revelation
that
has
just
been
made
to
us
said
dr
marjoribanks
i
am
throwing
no
doubt
upon
it
for
my
part
but
my
conviction
was
that
tom
wodehouse
died
in
the
west
indies
he
was
just
the
kind
of
man
to
die
in
the
west
indies
if
it
you
said
the
doctor
with
a
growl
of
natural
indignation
you
have
the
constitution
of
an
elephant
you
should
have
been
dead
ten
years
ago
at
the
very
least
and
it
appears
to
me
there
would
be
some
difficulty
in
proving
identity
if
anybody
would
take
up
that
view
of
the
question
as
he
spoke
dr
marjoribanks
walked
round
the
looking
at
him
with
medical
criticism
the
doctor
eyes
shot
out
fiery
hazel
gleams
as
he
contemplated
the
heavy
figure
more
appearance
than
reality
he
muttered
to
himself
with
a
kind
of
grim
satisfaction
poising
a
forefinger
in
air
as
if
to
prove
the
unwholesome
flesh
and
then
he
went
round
to
the
other
elbow
of
the
unexpected
heir
the
thing
is
now
what
you
mean
to
do
for
them
to
repair
your
father
neglect
he
said
tapping
peremptorily
on
wodehouse
arm
there
is
something
else
to
be
said
in
the
mean
time
said
mr
wentworth
i
must
know
precisely
how
it
is
that
a
state
of
affairs
so
different
from
anything
mr
wodehouse
could
have
intended
has
come
about
the
mere
absence
of
a
will
does
not
seem
to
me
to
explain
it
i
should
like
to
have
mr
brown
advice
for
my
own
satisfaction
if
nothing
else
the
parson
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
i
can
see
said
wodehouse
unless
he
was
looking
for
a
legacy
or
that
sort
of
thing
as
for
the
girls
i
do
see
what
right
i
have
to
be
troubled
they
took
deuced
little
trouble
with
me
perhaps
they
have
taken
me
in
as
a
sort
of
footman
without
pay
you
heard
what
they
said
waters
by
jove
i
serve
miss
mary
out
for
that
said
the
vagabond
then
he
paused
a
little
and
looking
round
him
moderated
his
tone
been
badly
used
all
my
life
said
the
prodigal
son
they
would
never
give
me
a
hearing
they
say
i
did
heaps
of
things
i
never
dreamt
of
mary
aint
above
thinking
of
her
own
interest
here
mr
proctor
came
forward
from
the
middle
of
the
room
where
he
had
been
standing
in
a
perplexed
manner
since
the
ladies
went
away
hold
hold
your
tongue
sir
said
the
late
rector
have
you
done
enough
injury
already
when
he
had
said
so
much
he
stopped
as
abruptly
as
he
had
begun
and
seemed
to
recollect
all
at
once
that
he
had
no
title
to
interfere
by
jove
said
wodehouse
you
do
seem
to
think
i
know
what
belongs
to
me
or
who
belongs
to
me
hold
tongue
waters
i
can
speak
for
myself
i
been
long
enough
snubbed
by
everybody
that
had
a
mind
i
do
mean
to
put
up
with
this
sort
of
thing
any
longer
any
man
who
pleases
can
consult
john
brown
i
recollect
john
brown
as
well
as
anybody
in
carlingford
it
do
matter
to
me
what
he
says
or
what
anybody
says
the
girls
are
a
parcel
of
girls
and
i
am
my
son
as
it
happens
i
should
have
thought
the
parson
had
enough
on
his
hands
for
one
while
said
the
new
heir
in
the
insolence
of
triumph
he
tried
patronising
me
but
that
would
answer
why
there
his
brother
jack
wentworth
his
elder
brother
come
down
here
purposely
to
manage
matters
for
me
he
the
eldest
son
by
jove
and
one
of
the
greatest
swells
going
he
has
come
down
here
on
purpose
to
do
the
friendly
thing
by
me
we
great
friends
by
jove
jack
wentworth
and
i
and
yet
here
a
beggarly
younger
brother
that
has
a
penny
wodehouse
said
mr
wentworth
with
some
contempt
sit
down
and
be
quiet
you
and
i
have
some
things
to
talk
of
which
had
better
not
be
discussed
in
public
leave
jack
wentworth
name
alone
if
you
are
wise
and
do
imagine
that
i
am
going
to
bear
your
punishment
be
silent
sir
cried
the
curate
sternly
do
you
suppose
i
ask
any
explanations
from
you
mr
waters
i
want
to
hear
how
this
has
come
about
when
i
saw
you
in
this
man
interest
some
time
ago
you
were
not
so
friendly
to
him
tell
me
how
it
happens
that
he
is
now
your
client
and
that
you
set
him
forth
as
the
heir
by
jove
the
parson
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
let
him
find
it
out
muttered
wodehouse
in
his
beard
but
the
words
were
only
half
audible
and
the
vagabond
shabby
soul
was
cowed
in
spite
of
himself
he
gave
the
lawyer
a
furtive
thrust
in
the
arm
as
he
spoke
and
looked
at
him
a
little
anxiously
for
the
position
of
a
man
standing
lawfully
on
his
natural
rights
was
new
to
wodehouse
and
all
his
certainty
of
the
facts
did
not
save
him
from
a
sensation
of
habit
which
suggested
that
close
examination
was
alarming
and
that
something
might
still
be
found
out
as
for
mr
waters
he
looked
with
placid
contempt
at
the
man
who
was
not
respectable
and
still
had
the
instincts
of
a
vagabond
in
his
heart
i
am
perfectly
ready
to
explain
said
the
irreproachable
solicitor
who
was
quite
secure
in
his
position
the
tone
of
the
request
however
might
be
modified
a
little
and
as
i
do
any
more
than
mr
wodehouse
see
exactly
what
right
mr
wentworth
has
to
demand
i
ask
an
explanation
not
on
my
own
behalf
but
for
the
miss
wodehouses
who
have
made
me
their
deputy
said
the
curate
for
their
satisfaction
and
that
i
may
consult
mr
brown
you
seem
to
forget
that
all
gains
they
lose
which
surely
justifies
their
representative
in
asking
how
did
it
come
about
it
was
at
this
point
that
all
the
other
gentlemen
present
pressed
closer
and
evinced
an
intention
to
take
part
dr
marjoribanks
was
the
first
to
speak
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
while
he
consumed
it
looked
from
under
his
grizzled
sandy
eyebrows
with
a
perplexing
mixture
of
doubt
and
respect
at
the
perpetual
curate
he
was
a
man
of
some
discrimination
in
his
way
and
the
young
man
lofty
looks
impressed
him
a
little
in
spite
of
himself
not
to
interrupt
the
explanation
said
dr
marjoribanks
which
all
be
glad
to
hear
but
mr
wentworth
a
young
man
not
possessed
so
far
as
i
am
aware
of
any
particular
right
except
that
he
has
been
very
generous
and
prompt
in
offering
his
services
said
the
doctor
moved
to
the
admission
by
a
fiery
glance
from
the
curate
eye
which
somehow
did
not
look
like
the
eye
of
a
guilty
man
i
was
thinking
an
old
man
and
an
old
friend
like
myself
might
maybe
be
a
better
guardian
for
the
ladies
interests
mr
proctor
who
had
been
listening
very
anxiously
was
seized
with
a
cough
at
this
moment
which
drowned
out
the
doctor
words
it
was
a
preparatory
cough
and
out
of
it
the
late
rector
rushed
into
speech
i
have
come
from
from
oxford
to
be
of
use
said
the
new
champion
my
time
is
entirely
at
my
own
at
miss
wodehouse
at
the
miss
wodehouses
disposal
i
am
most
desirous
to
be
of
use
said
mr
proctor
anxiously
and
he
advanced
close
to
the
table
to
prefer
his
claim
such
a
discussion
seems
quite
unnecessary
said
mr
wentworth
with
some
haughtiness
i
shall
certainly
do
in
the
mean
time
what
has
been
intrusted
to
me
at
present
we
are
simply
losing
time
but
said
the
rector
the
word
was
not
of
importance
nor
uttered
with
much
resolution
but
it
arrested
mr
wentworth
more
surely
than
the
shout
of
a
multitude
he
turned
sharp
round
upon
his
adversary
and
said
well
with
an
air
of
exasperation
while
wodehouse
who
had
been
lounging
about
the
room
in
a
discomfited
condition
drew
near
to
listen
i
am
comparatively
a
stranger
to
the
miss
wodehouses
said
mr
morgan
still
i
am
their
clergyman
and
i
think
with
dr
marjoribanks
that
a
young
man
like
mr
wentworth
especially
a
man
so
seriously
compromised
oh
stop
i
do
think
you
are
all
a
great
deal
too
hard
upon
mr
wentworth
said
the
lawyer
with
a
laugh
of
toleration
which
wodehouse
echoed
behind
him
with
a
sense
of
temerity
that
made
his
laughter
all
the
louder
he
was
frightened
but
he
was
glad
to
make
himself
offensive
according
to
his
nature
mr
wentworth
stood
alone
for
his
part
and
had
to
put
up
with
the
laugh
as
he
best
could
if
any
one
here
wishes
to
injure
me
with
the
miss
wodehouses
an
opportunity
may
easily
be
found
said
the
curate
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
muster
and
i
am
ready
to
relinquish
my
charge
when
they
call
on
me
to
do
so
in
the
mean
time
this
is
not
the
place
to
investigate
my
conduct
sit
down
sir
and
let
us
be
free
of
your
interference
for
this
moment
at
least
he
said
fiercely
turning
to
the
new
heir
i
warn
you
again
you
have
nothing
but
justice
to
expect
at
my
hands
mr
waters
we
wait
your
explanations
he
was
the
tallest
man
in
the
room
which
perhaps
had
something
to
do
with
it
the
youngest
best
born
and
best
endowed
that
he
would
have
carried
the
day
triumphantly
in
the
opinion
of
any
popular
audience
there
could
be
no
kind
of
doubt
even
in
this
unimpressionable
assembly
his
indignant
had
a
certain
influence
when
he
drew
a
chair
towards
the
table
and
seated
himself
the
others
sat
down
unawares
and
the
lawyer
began
his
story
without
any
further
interruption
the
explanation
of
all
was
that
mr
wodehouse
like
so
many
men
had
an
ambition
to
end
his
days
as
a
country
gentleman
he
had
set
his
heart
for
years
on
an
estate
in
the
neighbourhood
of
carlingford
and
had
just
completed
his
purchase
at
the
moment
of
his
last
seizure
nobody
knew
except
the
curate
and
the
lawyer
what
the
cause
of
that
seizure
was
they
exchanged
looks
without
being
aware
of
it
and
wodehouse
still
more
deeply
conscious
uttered
poor
wretch
a
kind
of
gasp
which
sounded
like
a
laugh
to
the
other
horrified
spectators
after
all
it
was
his
crime
which
had
brought
him
his
good
fortune
for
there
had
been
an
early
will
relating
to
property
which
existed
no
longer
property
which
had
been
altogether
absorbed
in
the
estate
i
have
no
doubt
my
late
excellent
partner
would
have
made
a
settlement
had
the
time
been
permitted
him
said
mr
waters
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
his
intentions
but
the
end
was
very
unexpected
at
the
last
i
suppose
death
always
is
unexpected
when
it
comes
said
the
lawyer
with
a
little
solemnity
recollecting
that
three
of
his
auditors
were
clergymen
the
result
is
painful
in
many
respects
but
law
is
law
and
such
accidents
can
not
be
entirely
avoided
with
the
exception
of
a
few
trifling
personal
matters
and
the
furniture
and
a
little
money
at
the
bank
there
is
nothing
but
freehold
property
and
of
course
the
son
takes
that
i
can
have
no
possible
objection
to
your
consulting
mr
brown
but
mr
brown
can
give
you
no
further
information
if
there
had
been
any
little
hope
of
possible
redress
lingering
in
the
mind
of
the
perplexed
assembly
this
brought
it
to
a
conclusion
the
heir
who
had
been
keeping
behind
with
an
impulse
of
natural
shame
came
back
to
the
table
when
his
rights
were
so
clearly
established
he
did
not
know
how
to
behave
himself
with
a
good
grace
but
he
was
disposed
to
be
conciliatory
as
far
as
he
could
especially
as
it
began
to
be
disagreeably
apparent
that
the
possession
of
his
father
property
might
not
make
any
particular
difference
in
the
world
opinion
of
himself
it
aint
my
fault
gentlemen
said
wodehouse
of
course
i
expected
the
governor
to
take
care
of
the
girls
i
been
kept
out
of
it
for
twenty
years
and
that
a
long
time
by
jove
i
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
a
rich
man
son
since
i
was
a
lad
i
do
say
i
do
something
for
the
girls
if
they
behave
to
me
as
they
ought
and
as
for
you
gentlemen
who
were
friends
of
the
family
i
always
be
glad
to
see
you
in
my
house
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
a
friendly
smile
but
nobody
took
any
notice
of
the
overtures
of
the
new
heir
then
they
have
nothing
to
depend
upon
said
mr
proctor
whose
agitated
looks
were
the
most
inexplicable
feature
of
the
whole
no
shelter
even
no
near
relations
i
ever
heard
of
and
nobody
to
take
care
of
lucy
if
here
he
stopped
short
and
went
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
in
a
state
of
great
bewilderment
the
late
rector
was
so
buried
in
his
own
thoughts
whatever
they
might
be
that
he
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
further
conversation
which
went
on
behind
him
of
which
however
there
was
very
little
and
only
came
to
himself
when
he
saw
mr
wentworth
go
rapidly
through
the
garden
mr
proctor
rushed
after
the
perpetual
curate
he
might
be
seriously
compromised
as
mr
morgan
said
but
he
was
more
sympathetic
than
anybody
else
in
carlingford
under
present
circumstances
and
mr
proctor
in
his
uncertainty
could
not
help
having
a
certain
confidence
in
the
young
man
promptitude
and
vigour
he
made
up
to
him
out
of
breath
when
he
was
just
entering
george
street
carlingford
had
paid
what
respect
it
could
to
mr
memory
and
now
the
shutters
were
being
taken
off
the
and
people
in
general
were
very
willing
to
reward
themselves
for
their
by
taking
what
amusement
they
could
out
of
the
reports
which
already
began
to
be
circulated
about
the
way
in
which
the
miss
wodehouses
were
left
when
the
late
rector
came
up
with
the
perpetual
curate
opposite
masters
shop
there
was
quite
a
group
of
people
there
who
noted
the
conjunction
what
could
it
mean
was
there
going
to
be
a
compromise
was
carlingford
to
be
shamefully
cheated
out
of
the
investigation
and
all
the
details
about
rosa
elsworthy
for
which
it
hungered
mr
proctor
put
his
arm
through
that
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
and
permitted
himself
to
be
swept
along
by
the
greater
impetus
of
the
young
man
rapid
steps
for
at
this
moment
being
occupied
with
more
important
matters
the
late
rector
had
altogether
forgotten
mr
wentworth
peculiar
position
and
the
cloud
that
hung
over
him
what
a
very
extraordinary
thing
said
mr
proctor
what
could
have
betrayed
old
wodehouse
into
such
a
blunder
he
must
have
known
well
enough
this
son
this
fellow
has
been
living
all
the
time
of
course
it
is
quite
inexplicable
to
me
said
the
aggrieved
man
do
you
know
if
there
are
any
aunts
or
uncles
any
people
whom
poor
little
lucy
might
live
with
for
instance
if
and
here
mr
proctor
once
more
came
to
a
dead
stop
mr
wentworth
for
his
part
was
so
far
from
thinking
of
her
as
poor
little
lucy
that
he
was
much
offended
by
the
unnecessary
commiseration
the
sisters
will
naturally
remain
together
he
said
and
of
course
there
are
many
people
who
would
be
but
too
glad
to
receive
them
miss
wodehouse
is
old
enough
to
protect
her
sister
though
of
course
the
balance
of
character
is
on
the
other
side
said
the
inconsiderate
young
man
at
which
mr
proctor
winced
but
made
no
definite
reply
so
you
think
there
are
people
she
could
go
to
said
the
late
rector
after
a
pause
the
thing
altogether
is
so
unexpected
you
know
my
idea
was
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
curate
i
must
see
mr
brown
and
this
is
about
the
best
time
to
find
him
at
home
circumstances
make
it
rather
awkward
for
me
to
call
at
the
rectory
just
now
he
continued
with
a
smile
smile
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
as
people
say
but
perhaps
you
will
stay
long
enough
to
see
me
put
on
my
trial
now
stop
a
moment
said
mr
proctor
about
this
trial
do
be
affronted
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
know
and
morgan
means
very
well
though
he
stupid
enough
i
should
like
to
stand
your
friend
wentworth
you
know
i
would
i
wish
you
yield
to
tell
me
all
about
it
if
i
were
to
call
on
you
after
dinner
for
perhaps
it
would
put
mrs
hadwin
out
to
give
me
a
chop
the
curate
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
fellows
of
dine
on
chops
he
said
unable
to
repress
a
gleam
of
amusement
but
come
at
six
and
you
shall
have
something
to
eat
as
good
as
i
can
give
you
as
for
telling
you
all
about
it
said
mr
wentworth
all
the
world
is
welcome
to
know
as
much
as
i
know
mr
proctor
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
man
arm
by
way
of
soothing
him
we
talk
it
all
over
he
said
confidentially
both
this
affair
and
and
the
other
we
have
a
good
deal
in
common
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
and
i
trust
we
shall
always
be
good
friends
said
the
inexplicable
man
his
complexion
heightened
considerably
after
he
had
made
this
speech
which
conveyed
nothing
but
amazement
to
the
mind
of
the
curate
and
then
he
shook
hands
hastily
and
hurried
back
again
towards
grange
lane
if
there
had
been
either
room
or
leisure
in
frank
wentworth
mind
for
other
thoughts
he
might
have
laughed
or
puzzled
over
the
palpable
mystery
but
as
it
was
he
had
dismissed
the
late
rector
entirely
from
his
mind
before
he
reached
the
door
of
mr
room
where
the
lawyer
was
seated
alone
john
brown
who
was
altogether
a
different
type
of
man
from
mr
waters
held
out
his
hand
to
his
visitor
and
did
not
look
at
all
surprised
to
see
him
i
have
expected
a
call
from
you
he
said
now
that
your
old
friend
is
gone
from
whom
you
would
naturally
have
sought
advice
in
the
circumstances
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
and
it
became
apparent
to
mr
wentworth
that
it
was
his
own
affairs
which
were
supposed
to
be
the
cause
of
his
application
it
may
be
supposed
after
this
that
the
curate
stated
his
real
object
very
curtly
and
clearly
without
any
unnecessary
words
to
the
unbounded
amazement
of
the
lawyer
who
being
a
busy
man
and
not
a
friend
of
the
wodehouses
had
as
yet
heard
nothing
of
the
matter
mr
brown
however
could
only
confirm
what
had
been
already
said
if
it
is
really
freehold
property
and
no
settlement
made
there
can
not
be
any
question
about
it
he
said
but
i
will
see
waters
and
make
all
sure
if
you
wish
it
though
he
dares
not
mislead
you
on
such
a
point
i
am
very
sorry
for
the
ladies
but
i
do
see
what
can
be
done
for
them
said
mr
brown
and
about
yourself
mr
wentworth
perhaps
it
was
because
of
a
certain
look
of
genuine
confidence
and
solicitude
in
john
brown
honest
face
that
the
curate
heart
was
moved
for
the
first
time
he
condescended
to
discuss
the
matter
to
tell
the
lawyer
with
whom
indeed
he
had
but
a
very
slight
acquaintance
for
john
brown
lived
at
the
other
end
of
carlingford
and
could
not
be
said
to
be
in
society
all
he
knew
about
rosa
elsworthy
and
something
of
his
suspicions
mr
brown
for
his
part
knew
little
of
the
perpetual
curate
in
his
social
capacity
but
he
knew
about
wharfside
which
was
more
to
the
purpose
and
having
himself
been
truly
in
love
once
in
his
life
commonplace
as
he
looked
this
honest
man
did
not
believe
it
possible
that
lucy
wodehouse
representative
could
be
rosa
seducer
the
two
things
looked
incompatible
to
the
straightforward
vision
of
john
brown
i
attend
at
their
investigation
he
said
with
a
smile
which
if
you
were
not
particularly
interested
you
find
not
bad
fun
mr
wentworth
these
private
attempts
at
law
are
generally
very
amusing
i
attend
and
look
after
your
interests
but
you
had
better
see
that
this
tom
wodehouse
i
remember
the
scamp
he
used
to
be
bad
enough
for
anything
do
give
you
the
slip
and
get
out
of
the
way
find
out
if
you
can
where
he
has
been
living
these
two
days
i
attend
to
the
other
matter
too
the
lawyer
said
cheerfully
shaking
hands
with
his
new
client
and
the
curate
went
away
with
a
vague
feeling
that
matters
were
about
to
come
right
somehow
at
which
he
smiled
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
and
saw
how
little
foundation
he
had
for
such
a
hope
but
his
hands
were
full
of
business
and
he
had
no
time
to
consider
his
own
affairs
at
this
particular
moment
it
seemed
to
him
a
kind
of
profanity
to
permit
lucy
to
remain
under
the
same
roof
with
wodehouse
even
though
he
was
her
brother
and
mr
proctor
inquiries
had
stimulated
his
own
feeling
there
was
a
certain
pleasure
besides
in
postponing
himself
and
his
own
business
however
important
to
her
and
her
concerns
and
it
was
with
this
idea
that
he
proceeded
to
the
house
of
his
aunts
and
was
conducted
to
a
little
private
appropriated
to
the
sole
use
of
miss
leonora
for
whom
he
had
asked
as
he
passed
the
door
of
the
which
was
ajar
he
glanced
in
and
saw
his
aunt
dora
bending
over
somebody
who
wept
and
heard
a
familiar
voice
pouring
out
complaints
the
general
sound
of
which
was
equally
familiar
though
he
could
not
make
out
a
word
of
the
special
subject
frank
was
startled
notwithstanding
his
preoccupations
for
it
was
the
same
voice
which
had
summoned
him
to
wentworth
rectory
which
now
poured
out
its
lamentations
in
the
miss
in
carlingford
evidently
some
new
complication
had
arisen
in
the
affairs
of
the
family
miss
leonora
was
in
her
room
busy
with
the
books
of
a
ladies
association
of
which
she
was
treasurer
she
had
a
letter
before
her
from
the
missionary
employed
by
the
society
which
was
a
very
interesting
letter
and
likely
to
make
a
considerable
sensation
when
read
before
the
next
meeting
miss
leonora
was
taking
the
cream
off
this
piece
of
correspondence
enjoying
at
once
itself
and
the
impression
it
would
make
she
was
slightly
annoyed
when
her
nephew
came
in
to
disturb
her
the
others
are
in
the
as
usual
she
said
i
ca
imagine
what
lewis
could
be
thinking
of
to
bring
you
here
louisa
coming
can
make
no
difference
to
you
so
louisa
has
come
i
thought
i
heard
her
voice
what
has
happened
to
bring
louisa
here
said
the
curate
who
was
not
sorry
to
begin
with
an
indifferent
subject
miss
leonora
shook
her
head
and
took
up
her
letter
she
is
in
the
said
the
aunt
if
you
have
no
particular
business
with
me
frank
you
had
better
ask
herself
of
course
if
you
want
me
i
am
at
your
service
but
otherwise
i
am
busy
you
see
and
so
am
i
said
mr
wentworth
as
busy
as
a
man
can
be
whose
character
is
at
stake
do
you
know
i
am
to
be
tried
but
that
is
not
what
i
came
to
ask
you
about
i
wish
you
would
me
about
it
said
miss
leonora
she
got
up
from
her
and
from
the
missionary
letter
and
abandoned
herself
to
the
impulses
of
nature
i
have
heard
disagreeable
rumours
i
do
object
to
your
reserve
frank
but
things
seem
to
be
getting
serious
what
does
it
mean
the
curate
had
been
much
braced
in
his
inner
man
by
his
short
interview
with
john
brown
that
and
the
representative
position
he
held
had
made
a
wonderful
change
in
his
feelings
besides
a
matter
which
was
about
to
become
so
public
could
not
be
ignored
it
means
only
that
a
good
many
people
in
carlingford
think
me
a
villain
said
mr
wentworth
it
is
not
a
flattering
idea
and
it
seems
to
me
i
must
say
an
illogical
induction
from
the
facts
of
my
life
still
it
is
true
that
some
people
think
so
and
i
am
to
be
tried
but
in
the
mean
time
something
else
has
happened
i
know
you
are
a
good
woman
aunt
leonora
we
do
agree
in
many
things
but
that
does
not
matter
there
are
two
ladies
in
carlingford
who
up
to
this
day
have
been
rich
well
off
well
cared
for
and
who
have
suddenly
lost
all
their
means
their
protector
even
their
home
they
have
no
relations
that
i
know
of
one
of
them
is
good
for
any
exertion
that
may
be
necessary
said
the
curate
his
voice
softening
with
a
masculine
suggestion
as
of
tears
but
she
is
young
too
young
to
contend
with
the
world
and
she
is
now
suffering
her
first
grief
the
other
is
old
enough
but
not
good
for
much
you
mean
the
two
miss
wodehouses
said
miss
leonora
their
father
has
turned
out
to
be
bankrupt
or
something
worse
than
bankrupt
said
the
curate
there
is
a
brother
who
takes
everything
will
you
stand
by
them
offer
them
shelter
i
mean
for
a
time
i
do
know
anybody
i
should
care
to
apply
to
but
you
miss
leonora
paused
and
looked
at
her
nephew
first
tell
me
what
you
have
to
do
with
them
she
asked
if
there
is
a
brother
he
is
their
natural
protector
certainly
not
you
unless
there
is
something
i
do
know
of
frank
you
know
you
ca
marry
said
miss
leonora
with
a
little
vehemence
once
more
looking
in
her
nephew
face
no
said
frank
with
momentary
bitterness
i
am
not
likely
to
make
any
mistake
about
that
at
present
at
least
the
brother
is
a
reprobate
of
whom
they
know
nothing
i
have
no
right
to
consider
myself
their
protector
but
i
am
their
friend
at
least
said
the
curate
breaking
off
with
again
that
softening
in
his
voice
they
may
have
a
great
many
friends
for
anything
i
know
but
i
have
confidence
in
you
aunt
leonora
you
are
not
perhaps
particularly
sympathetic
he
went
on
with
a
laugh
you
do
condole
with
louisa
for
instance
but
i
could
trust
you
with
lucy
wodehouse
said
miss
leonora
i
do
dislike
her
at
all
if
she
would
not
wear
that
ridiculous
grey
cloak
but
young
men
take
such
an
interest
in
young
women
without
some
reason
for
it
what
are
we
to
do
for
you
frank
said
the
woman
looking
at
him
with
a
little
softness
miss
leonora
perhaps
was
not
used
to
be
taken
into
anybody
confidence
it
moved
her
more
than
might
have
been
expected
from
so
a
woman
perhaps
no
other
act
on
the
part
of
her
nephew
could
have
had
so
much
effect
had
he
been
able
to
pursue
his
advantage
upon
the
still
undecided
fate
of
skelmersdale
nothing
said
the
curate
he
met
her
eye
very
steadily
but
she
was
too
to
believe
that
he
felt
as
calmly
as
he
looked
nothing
he
repeated
again
i
told
you
as
much
before
i
have
been
slandered
here
and
here
i
must
remain
there
are
no
parsonages
or
paradises
for
me
with
which
speech
mr
wentworth
shook
hands
with
his
aunt
and
went
away
he
left
miss
leonora
as
he
had
left
her
on
various
occasions
considerably
confused
in
her
ideas
she
could
not
enjoy
any
longer
the
cream
of
the
missionary
letter
when
she
tried
to
resume
her
reading
her
attention
flagged
over
it
after
a
while
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
out
after
a
little
consultation
with
her
maid
who
assisted
her
in
the
housekeeping
department
the
house
was
tolerably
full
at
the
present
moment
but
it
was
elastic
she
was
met
at
the
green
door
of
mr
wodehouse
garden
by
the
new
proprietor
who
stared
excessively
and
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
such
an
apparition
jack
wentworth
aunt
by
jove
he
said
to
himself
and
took
off
his
hat
meaning
to
show
her
a
little
civility
miss
leonora
thought
him
one
of
the
attendants
at
the
recent
ceremonial
and
passed
him
without
any
ceremony
she
was
quite
intent
upon
her
charitable
mission
mr
wentworth
confidence
was
justified
chapter
xxxv
mr
wentworth
day
had
been
closely
occupied
up
to
this
point
he
had
gone
through
a
great
many
emotions
and
transacted
a
good
deal
of
business
and
he
went
home
with
the
comparative
ease
of
a
man
whose
anxieties
are
relieved
not
by
any
real
deliverance
but
by
the
soothing
influence
of
fatigue
and
the
sense
of
something
accomplished
he
was
not
in
reality
in
a
better
position
than
when
he
left
his
house
in
the
morning
bitterly
mortified
injured
and
wounded
at
the
tenderest
point
things
were
very
much
the
same
as
they
had
been
but
a
change
had
come
over
the
feelings
of
the
perpetual
curate
he
remembered
with
a
smile
as
he
went
down
grange
lane
that
mr
proctor
was
to
dine
with
him
and
that
he
had
rashly
undertaken
to
have
something
better
than
a
chop
it
was
a
very
foolish
engagement
under
the
circumstances
mr
wentworth
was
cogitating
within
himself
whether
he
could
make
an
appeal
to
the
sympathies
of
his
aunt
cook
for
something
worthy
of
the
sensitive
palate
of
a
fellow
of
when
all
such
thoughts
were
suddenly
driven
out
of
his
mind
by
the
apparition
of
his
brother
gerald
perhaps
the
last
man
in
the
world
whom
he
could
have
expected
to
see
in
carlingford
gerald
was
coming
up
grange
lane
in
his
meditative
way
from
mrs
hadwin
door
to
look
at
him
was
enough
to
reveal
to
any
spectator
the
presence
of
some
perpetual
argument
in
his
mind
though
he
had
come
out
to
look
for
frank
his
eyes
were
continually
forsaking
his
intention
catching
spots
of
lichen
on
the
wall
and
clumps
of
herbage
on
the
roadside
the
long
discussion
had
become
so
familiar
to
him
that
even
now
when
his
mind
was
made
up
he
could
not
relinquish
the
habit
which
possessed
him
when
he
perceived
frank
he
quickened
his
steps
they
met
with
only
such
a
modified
expression
of
surprise
on
the
part
of
the
younger
brother
as
was
natural
to
a
meeting
of
english
kinsfolk
i
heard
louisa
voice
in
my
aunt
said
frank
but
oddly
enough
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
have
come
with
her
and
then
gerald
turned
with
the
curate
when
the
ordinary
family
questions
were
asked
and
answered
a
silence
ensued
between
the
two
as
for
frank
in
the
multiplicity
of
his
own
cares
he
had
all
but
forgotten
his
brother
and
gerald
mind
though
full
of
anxiety
had
something
of
the
calm
which
might
be
supposed
to
subdue
the
senses
of
a
dying
man
he
was
on
the
eve
of
a
change
which
appeared
to
him
almost
as
great
as
death
and
the
knowledge
of
that
gave
him
a
curious
stillness
of
composure
almost
a
reluctance
to
speak
strangely
enough
each
brother
at
this
critical
moment
felt
it
necessary
to
occupy
himself
with
the
affairs
of
the
other
and
to
postpone
the
consideration
of
his
own
i
hope
you
have
changed
your
mind
a
little
since
we
last
met
said
frank
your
last
letter
we
talk
of
that
presently
said
the
elder
brother
in
the
mean
time
i
want
to
know
about
what
is
all
this
my
father
is
in
a
great
state
of
anxiety
he
does
not
seem
to
have
got
rid
of
his
fancy
that
you
were
somehow
involved
with
jack
and
jack
is
here
said
gerald
with
a
look
which
betokened
some
anxiety
on
his
own
part
i
wish
you
would
give
me
your
confidence
right
or
wrong
i
have
come
to
stand
by
you
frank
said
the
rector
of
wentworth
rather
mournfully
he
had
been
waiting
at
mrs
hadwin
for
the
last
two
hours
he
had
seen
that
worthy
woman
discomposed
looks
and
felt
that
she
did
not
shake
her
head
for
nothing
jack
had
been
the
bugbear
of
the
family
for
a
long
time
past
gerald
was
conscious
of
adding
heavily
at
the
present
moment
to
the
squire
troubles
charley
was
at
malta
in
indifferent
health
all
the
others
were
boys
there
was
only
frank
to
give
the
father
a
little
consolation
and
now
frank
it
appeared
was
most
deeply
compromised
of
all
no
wonder
gerald
was
sad
and
then
he
drew
forth
the
anonymous
letter
which
had
startled
all
the
wentworths
on
the
previous
night
this
is
written
by
somebody
who
hates
you
said
the
elder
brother
but
i
suppose
there
must
be
some
meaning
in
it
i
wish
you
would
be
frank
with
me
and
tell
me
what
it
is
this
appeal
had
brought
them
to
mrs
hadwin
door
which
the
curate
opened
with
his
key
before
he
answered
his
brother
the
old
lady
herself
was
walking
in
the
garden
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
with
a
shawl
thrown
over
the
best
cap
which
she
had
put
on
in
honour
of
the
stranger
mrs
hadwin
feelings
were
too
much
for
her
at
that
moment
her
head
was
nodding
with
the
excitement
of
age
and
injured
virtue
trembled
in
every
line
of
her
face
mr
wentworth
i
can
not
put
up
with
it
any
longer
it
is
a
thing
i
never
was
used
to
she
cried
as
soon
as
the
curate
came
within
hearing
i
have
shut
my
eyes
to
a
great
deal
but
i
can
not
bear
it
any
longer
if
i
had
been
a
common
keeper
i
could
not
have
been
treated
with
less
respect
but
to
be
outraged
to
be
insulted
what
is
the
matter
mrs
hadwin
said
mr
wentworth
in
dismay
sir
said
the
old
lady
who
was
trembling
with
passion
you
may
think
it
no
matter
to
turn
a
house
upside
down
as
mine
has
been
since
easter
to
bring
all
sorts
of
disreputable
people
about
persons
whom
a
gentlewoman
in
my
position
ought
never
to
have
heard
of
i
received
your
brother
into
my
house
cried
mrs
hadwin
turning
to
gerald
because
he
was
a
clergyman
and
i
knew
his
family
and
hoped
to
find
him
one
whose
principles
i
could
approve
of
i
have
put
up
with
a
great
deal
mr
wentworth
more
than
i
could
tell
to
anybody
i
took
in
his
friend
when
he
asked
me
and
gave
him
the
spare
room
though
it
was
against
my
judgment
i
suffered
a
man
with
a
beard
to
be
seen
stealing
in
and
out
of
my
house
in
the
evening
as
if
he
was
afraid
to
be
seen
you
gentlemen
may
not
think
much
of
that
but
it
was
a
terrible
thing
for
a
lady
in
my
position
unprotected
and
not
so
well
off
as
i
once
was
it
made
my
house
like
a
and
so
my
friends
told
me
but
i
was
so
infatuated
i
put
up
with
it
all
for
mr
frank
sake
but
there
a
limit
said
the
aggrieved
woman
i
would
not
have
believed
it
i
not
have
believed
it
of
you
not
whatever
people
might
say
to
think
of
that
abandoned
disgraceful
girl
coming
openly
to
my
door
good
heavens
cried
the
curate
he
seized
mrs
hadwin
hand
evidently
forgetting
everything
else
she
had
said
what
girl
whom
do
you
mean
for
heaven
sake
compose
yourself
and
answer
me
who
was
it
rosa
elsworthy
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
for
me
cried
the
young
man
speak
quickly
when
was
it
where
is
she
for
heaven
sake
mrs
hadwin
speak
let
me
go
sir
cried
the
indignant
old
lady
let
me
go
this
instant
this
is
insult
upon
insult
i
appeal
to
you
mr
gerald
to
think
i
should
ever
be
supposed
capable
of
encouraging
such
a
horrid
shameless
how
dare
you
how
dare
you
name
such
a
creature
to
me
exclaimed
mrs
hadwin
with
hysterical
sobs
if
it
were
not
for
your
family
you
should
never
enter
my
house
again
oh
thank
you
mr
gerald
wentworth
indeed
i
am
not
able
to
walk
i
am
sure
i
do
want
to
grieve
you
about
your
brother
i
tried
not
to
believe
it
i
tried
as
long
as
i
could
not
to
believe
it
but
you
hear
how
he
speaks
do
you
think
sir
i
would
for
a
moment
permit
such
a
creature
to
enter
my
door
she
cried
again
turning
to
frank
wentworth
as
she
leaned
upon
his
brother
arm
i
do
know
what
kind
of
a
creature
the
poor
girl
is
said
the
curate
but
i
know
that
if
you
had
taken
her
in
it
would
have
saved
me
much
pain
and
trouble
tell
me
at
least
when
she
came
and
who
saw
her
or
if
she
left
any
message
perhaps
sarah
will
tell
me
he
said
with
a
sigh
of
despair
as
he
saw
that
handmaiden
hovering
behind
sarah
had
been
a
little
shy
of
mr
wentworth
since
the
night
wodehouse
disappeared
she
had
betrayed
herself
to
the
curate
and
did
not
like
to
remember
the
fact
now
she
came
up
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
and
a
sense
of
equality
primed
and
ready
with
her
reply
i
hope
i
think
more
of
myself
than
to
take
notice
of
any
sich
said
sarah
but
her
instincts
were
more
vivid
than
those
of
her
mistress
and
she
could
not
refrain
from
particulars
them
as
saw
her
now
would
see
much
in
her
i
never
see
such
a
changed
creature
said
sarah
not
as
i
ever
thought
anything
of
her
looks
a
bit
of
a
shawl
dragged
around
her
and
her
eyes
as
if
they
would
jump
out
of
her
head
laws
she
did
get
no
satisfaction
here
said
the
housemaid
with
a
little
triumph
silence
sarah
said
mrs
hadwin
that
is
not
a
way
to
speak
to
your
clergyman
i
go
in
mr
wentworth
please
i
am
not
equal
to
so
much
agitation
if
mr
frank
will
come
indoors
i
should
be
glad
to
have
an
explanation
for
this
sort
of
thing
can
not
go
on
said
the
old
lady
as
for
the
curate
he
did
not
pay
the
least
attention
either
to
the
disapproval
or
the
impertinence
at
what
time
did
she
come
which
way
did
she
go
did
she
leave
any
message
he
repeated
a
moment
will
be
of
more
use
than
all
this
indignation
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
me
to
see
rosa
elsworthy
here
how
it
is
gerald
said
the
curate
driven
to
his
wit
end
a
word
from
the
girl
is
all
i
want
to
make
an
end
of
all
this
this
disgusting
folly
and
you
see
how
i
am
thwarted
perhaps
they
will
answer
when
did
she
come
did
she
say
anything
he
cried
turning
sharply
upon
sarah
who
frightened
by
mr
wentworth
look
and
dismayed
to
see
her
mistress
moving
away
and
to
feel
herself
alone
opposed
to
him
burst
at
last
into
an
alarmed
statement
please
sir
it
aint
no
fault
of
mine
said
sarah
it
was
missis
as
saw
her
she
aint
been
gone
not
half
an
hour
it
all
happened
since
your
brother
left
she
come
to
the
missis
would
hear
nothing
she
had
got
to
say
nor
let
her
speak
oh
mr
wentworth
you
go
after
her
cried
the
girl
following
him
to
the
to
which
he
rushed
immediately
not
half
an
hour
gone
mr
wentworth
burst
into
the
lane
which
led
up
to
grove
street
and
where
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
he
went
back
to
grange
lane
and
inspected
every
corner
where
she
could
have
hid
herself
then
after
a
pause
he
walked
impetuously
up
the
quiet
road
and
into
elsworthy
shop
mrs
elsworthy
was
there
alone
occupying
her
husband
place
who
had
gone
as
usual
to
the
railway
for
the
evening
papers
she
jumped
up
from
the
high
stool
she
was
seated
on
when
the
curate
entered
good
gracious
mr
wentworth
cried
the
frightened
woman
and
instinctively
called
the
who
was
the
only
other
individual
within
hearing
she
was
unprotected
and
quite
unable
to
defend
herself
if
he
meant
anything
and
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
that
there
was
meaning
of
the
most
serious
and
energetic
kind
in
mr
wentworth
face
has
rosa
come
back
he
asked
is
she
here
do
stare
at
me
but
speak
has
she
come
back
i
have
just
heard
that
she
was
at
my
house
half
an
hour
ago
have
you
got
her
safe
it
was
at
this
moment
that
wodehouse
came
lounging
in
with
his
cigar
appearing
in
the
midst
of
his
beard
and
a
curious
look
of
and
demonstration
in
his
general
aspect
when
the
curate
hearing
the
steps
turned
round
upon
him
he
fell
back
for
a
moment
not
expecting
such
an
encounter
then
the
vagabond
recovered
himself
and
came
forward
with
the
swagger
which
was
his
only
alternative
i
thought
you
were
on
good
terms
here
said
wodehouse
who
are
you
asking
after
it
a
fine
evening
and
they
do
seem
up
to
much
in
my
house
i
have
asked
jack
wentworth
to
the
blue
boar
at
seven
will
you
come
i
do
want
to
bear
any
grudge
i
do
know
if
they
can
cook
anything
fit
to
be
eaten
in
my
house
it
was
me
you
were
asking
after
the
fellow
came
and
stood
close
shoulder
to
shoulder
by
the
perpetual
curate
by
jove
sir
i
as
good
a
right
here
as
you
or
anywhere
he
muttered
as
mr
wentworth
withdrew
from
him
he
had
to
say
it
aloud
to
convince
himself
of
the
fact
for
it
was
hard
after
being
clandestine
for
half
a
lifetime
to
move
about
freely
in
the
daylight
as
for
mr
wentworth
he
fixed
his
eyes
full
on
the
face
i
want
to
know
if
rosa
has
come
home
he
repeated
in
the
clearest
tones
of
his
clear
voice
i
am
told
she
called
at
mrs
hadwin
half
an
hour
ago
has
she
come
back
he
scarcely
noticed
mrs
elsworthy
answer
for
in
the
mean
time
the
cigar
dropped
out
of
wodehouse
beard
out
of
his
fingers
he
made
an
involuntary
step
back
out
of
the
curate
way
by
jove
he
exclaimed
to
himself
the
news
was
more
important
to
him
than
to
either
of
the
others
after
a
minute
he
turned
his
back
upon
them
and
kicked
the
cigar
which
he
had
dropped
out
into
the
street
with
much
blundering
and
unnecessary
violence
but
turned
round
and
stopped
short
in
this
occupation
as
soon
as
he
heard
mrs
elsworthy
voice
she
has
come
here
said
that
virtuous
woman
sharply
i
give
in
to
elsworthy
a
deal
but
i
never
said
i
give
in
to
take
her
back
she
been
and
disgraced
us
all
and
she
not
a
drop
blood
to
me
said
mrs
elsworthy
them
as
has
brought
her
to
this
pass
had
best
look
after
her
i
washed
my
hands
of
rosa
and
all
belonging
to
her
she
knows
better
than
to
come
here
who
speaking
of
rosa
said
elsworthy
who
just
then
came
in
with
his
bundle
of
newspapers
from
the
railway
i
might
have
know
as
it
was
mr
wentworth
matters
is
going
to
be
cleared
sir
between
me
and
you
if
you
was
going
to
make
a
proposal
i
aint
revengeful
and
open
to
any
arrangement
as
is
honourable
to
save
things
coming
afore
the
public
i
been
expecting
of
it
you
may
speak
free
sir
you
need
be
afraid
of
me
fool
said
the
curate
hotly
your
niece
has
been
seen
in
carlingford
she
came
to
my
door
i
am
told
about
an
hour
ago
give
up
this
folly
and
let
us
make
an
effort
to
find
her
i
tell
you
she
came
to
my
house
in
course
sir
said
elsworthy
it
was
the
most
naturalest
place
for
her
to
go
do
you
stand
upon
it
no
longer
as
if
you
could
deceive
folks
it
will
be
your
ruin
mr
wentworth
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
i
aint
no
fool
but
i
open
to
a
honourable
proposal
i
am
it
ruin
you
ay
and
i
ruin
you
cried
rosa
uncle
hoarsely
if
you
do
change
your
mind
afore
it
your
last
chance
if
you
care
for
your
character
is
mr
wentworth
did
not
condescend
to
make
any
answer
he
followed
wodehouse
who
had
shuffled
out
after
his
cigar
and
stopped
him
on
the
step
i
wonder
if
it
is
any
use
appealing
to
your
honour
he
said
i
suppose
you
were
a
gentleman
once
and
had
the
feelings
of
by
jove
i
as
good
a
gentleman
as
you
are
cried
the
new
heir
i
could
buy
you
up
you
and
all
that
belongs
to
you
by
jove
i
giving
jack
wentworth
a
dinner
at
the
blue
boar
i
not
a
man
to
be
it
appears
to
me
you
have
got
enough
to
do
if
you
mind
your
own
business
said
wodehouse
with
a
sneer
you
in
a
nice
mess
though
you
are
the
parson
i
told
jack
wentworth
so
last
night
the
curate
stood
on
the
step
of
elsworthy
shop
with
his
enemy
behind
and
the
ungrateful
vagabond
whom
he
had
rescued
and
guarded
standing
in
front
of
him
with
that
sneer
on
his
lips
it
was
hard
to
refrain
from
the
natural
impulse
which
prompted
him
to
pitch
the
vagabond
out
of
his
way
look
here
he
said
sharply
you
have
not
much
character
to
lose
but
a
scamp
is
a
different
thing
from
a
criminal
i
will
make
the
principal
people
in
carlingford
aware
what
were
the
precise
circumstances
under
which
you
came
here
at
easter
if
you
do
not
immediately
restore
this
unhappy
girl
to
her
friends
do
you
understand
me
if
it
is
not
done
at
once
i
will
make
use
of
my
information
and
you
know
what
that
means
you
can
defy
me
if
you
please
but
in
that
case
you
had
better
make
up
your
mind
to
the
consequences
you
will
have
to
take
your
place
as
a
stop
cried
wodehouse
with
a
shiver
we
not
by
ourselves
in
the
public
street
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
like
that
here
come
to
my
house
wentworth
there
a
good
fellow
i
ordered
a
dinner
be
silent
sir
said
the
curate
i
give
you
till
noon
after
that
i
will
spare
you
no
longer
you
understand
what
i
mean
i
have
been
too
merciful
already
if
everything
is
not
arranged
to
my
satisfaction
here
it
was
my
own
name
said
wodehouse
sullenly
nobody
can
say
it
was
my
own
name
you
could
do
me
any
harm
you
know
you
would
either
for
the
sake
of
the
girls
i
i
give
them
a
thousand
pounds
or
so
if
i
find
i
can
afford
it
come
you
do
mean
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
said
the
conscious
criminal
you
would
do
me
any
harm
if
i
have
to
fight
for
my
own
reputation
i
shall
not
spare
you
cried
the
curate
mind
what
i
say
you
are
safe
till
twelve
but
after
that
i
will
have
no
mercy
not
for
your
sake
not
for
any
inducement
in
the
world
if
you
want
to
be
known
as
a
oh
lord
do
speak
so
loud
what
do
you
mean
wentworth
i
say
hist
mr
wentworth
by
jove
he
wo
listen
to
me
cried
wodehouse
in
an
agony
when
he
found
that
the
curate
was
already
out
of
hearing
the
vagabond
looked
round
him
on
every
side
with
his
natural
instinct
of
suspicion
if
he
had
known
that
mr
wentworth
was
thinking
only
of
disgrace
and
the
stern
sentence
of
public
opinion
wodehouse
could
have
put
up
with
it
but
he
himself
in
his
guilty
imagination
jumped
at
the
bar
and
the
prison
which
had
haunted
him
for
long
somehow
it
felt
natural
that
such
a
nemesis
should
come
to
him
after
the
morning
triumph
he
stood
looking
after
the
curate
guilty
and
till
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
remarked
and
then
he
made
a
circuit
past
elsworthy
as
far
as
the
end
of
prickett
lane
where
he
ventured
to
cross
over
so
as
to
get
to
his
own
house
his
own
house
the
wretched
thrill
of
terror
that
went
through
him
was
a
very
sufficient
offset
against
his
momentary
triumph
and
this
was
succeeded
by
a
flush
of
rage
as
he
thought
of
the
curate
other
information
what
was
to
be
done
every
moment
was
precious
but
he
felt
an
instinctive
horror
of
venturing
out
again
in
the
daylight
when
it
approached
the
hour
at
which
he
had
ordered
that
dinner
at
the
blue
boar
the
humbled
hero
wrapped
himself
in
an
old
overcoat
which
he
found
in
the
hall
and
slunk
into
the
inn
like
the
clandestine
wretch
he
was
he
had
no
confidence
in
himself
but
he
had
confidence
in
jack
wentworth
he
might
still
be
able
to
help
his
unlucky
associate
out
when
mr
wentworth
reached
his
rooms
he
found
that
his
guest
had
arrived
before
him
and
consequently
the
threatened
explanation
with
mrs
hadwin
was
forestalled
for
that
night
mr
proctor
and
gerald
were
sitting
together
not
at
all
knowing
what
to
talk
about
for
the
late
rector
was
aware
that
frank
wentworth
brother
was
on
the
verge
of
rome
and
was
confused
and
could
not
help
feeling
that
his
position
between
a
man
on
the
point
of
perversion
in
an
ecclesiastical
point
of
view
and
another
whose
morals
were
suspected
and
whose
character
was
compromised
was
to
say
the
least
a
very
odd
position
for
a
clergyman
of
unblemished
orthodoxy
and
respectability
besides
it
was
embarrassing
when
he
had
come
for
a
very
private
consultation
to
find
a
stranger
there
before
him
the
curate
went
in
very
full
of
what
had
just
occurred
the
events
of
the
last
two
or
three
hours
had
worked
a
total
change
in
his
feelings
he
was
no
longer
the
injured
insulted
silent
object
of
a
petty
but
virulent
persecution
the
contemptuous
silence
with
which
he
had
treated
the
scandal
at
first
and
the
still
more
obstinate
sense
of
wrong
which
latterly
had
shut
his
lips
and
his
heart
had
given
way
to
warmer
and
more
generous
emotions
what
would
have
seemed
to
him
in
the
morning
only
the
indignant
reserve
of
a
man
unjustly
suspected
appeared
now
a
foolish
and
unfriendly
reticence
the
only
thing
which
restrained
him
was
a
still
lingering
inclination
to
screen
wodehouse
if
possible
from
a
public
exposure
which
would
throw
shame
upon
his
sisters
as
well
as
himself
if
any
generosity
if
any
gentlemanly
feeling
were
still
left
in
the
vagabond
soul
it
was
possible
he
might
answer
the
curate
appeal
and
mr
wentworth
felt
himself
bound
to
offer
no
public
explanation
of
the
facts
of
the
case
until
this
last
chance
of
escape
had
been
left
for
the
criminal
but
so
far
as
regarded
himself
his
heart
was
opened
his
wounded
pride
mollified
and
he
was
ready
enough
to
talk
of
what
had
just
happened
and
to
explain
the
whole
business
to
his
anxious
companions
when
he
joined
them
indeed
he
was
so
full
of
it
as
almost
to
forget
that
he
himself
was
still
believed
the
hero
of
the
tale
this
unfortunate
little
girl
has
been
here
and
i
have
missed
her
he
said
without
in
the
least
concealing
his
vexation
and
the
excitement
which
his
rapid
walk
had
not
subdued
to
the
great
horror
of
mr
proctor
who
tried
all
he
could
by
telegraphic
glances
to
recall
the
young
man
to
a
sense
of
that
fact
that
sarah
was
in
the
room
i
must
say
i
think
it
is
imprudent
highly
imprudent
said
the
late
rector
they
will
call
these
women
to
prove
that
she
has
been
here
again
and
what
conclusion
but
one
can
possibly
be
drawn
from
such
a
fact
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
you
so
unguarded
he
said
this
seizing
the
moment
after
sarah
had
removed
the
salmon
which
was
very
good
and
was
served
with
a
sauce
which
pleased
mr
proctor
all
the
more
that
he
had
not
expected
much
from
an
impromptu
dinner
furnished
by
a
perpetual
curate
but
the
fact
was
that
gerald
arrival
had
awakened
mrs
hadwin
to
a
proper
regard
for
her
own
credit
which
was
at
stake
when
sarah
withdrew
finally
and
they
were
left
alone
frank
wentworth
gave
the
fullest
explanation
he
was
able
to
his
surprised
auditors
he
told
them
that
it
was
wodehouse
and
not
himself
whom
rosa
had
met
in
the
garden
and
whom
she
had
no
doubt
come
to
seek
at
this
crisis
of
their
fortunes
there
was
not
the
least
doubt
in
his
own
mind
that
wodehouse
had
carried
her
away
and
hidden
her
somewhere
close
at
hand
and
when
he
had
given
them
all
his
reasons
for
thinking
so
his
hearers
were
of
the
same
opinion
but
mr
proctor
continued
very
doubtful
and
perplexed
clear
though
the
story
was
he
sat
silent
brooding
over
the
new
mystery
while
the
brothers
discussed
the
original
questions
i
can
not
think
why
you
did
not
go
to
the
rector
at
once
and
tell
him
all
this
said
gerald
it
is
always
best
to
put
a
stop
to
gossip
at
least
you
will
see
him
or
let
me
see
him
the
rector
is
deeply
prejudiced
against
me
said
the
perpetual
curate
for
a
very
unworthy
reason
if
he
has
any
reason
at
all
he
has
never
asked
me
to
explain
i
shall
not
interfere
with
his
investigation
said
the
young
man
haughtily
let
it
go
on
i
have
been
working
here
for
five
years
and
the
carlingford
people
ought
to
know
better
as
for
the
rector
i
will
make
no
explanations
to
him
it
is
not
for
the
rector
it
is
for
yourself
said
gerald
and
this
fellow
wodehouse
surely
has
no
claim
but
at
the
sound
of
this
name
mr
proctor
roused
himself
from
his
pause
of
bewilderment
and
took
the
words
out
of
mr
wentworth
mouth
he
has
been
here
since
easter
but
why
said
the
late
rector
i
can
not
fancy
why
mr
wodehouse
son
should
come
to
you
when
his
father
house
was
so
near
in
hiding
why
was
he
in
hiding
he
is
evidently
a
scamp
said
mr
proctor
growing
red
but
that
is
not
so
unusual
i
do
understand
i
am
bound
to
say
i
do
understand
it
he
may
be
the
culprit
as
you
say
but
what
was
he
doing
here
i
took
him
in
at
miss
wodehouse
request
i
can
not
explain
why
will
tell
you
said
the
curate
as
for
wodehouse
i
have
given
him
another
chance
till
twelve
if
he
does
not
make
his
appearance
then
mr
proctor
had
listened
only
to
the
first
words
he
kept
moving
uneasily
in
his
seat
while
the
curate
spoke
then
he
broke
in
it
appears
i
can
not
see
miss
wodehouse
he
said
with
an
injured
tone
she
does
not
see
any
one
i
can
not
ask
for
any
explanation
but
it
seems
to
me
most
extraordinary
it
is
three
months
since
easter
if
he
had
been
living
with
you
all
the
time
there
must
have
been
some
occasion
for
it
i
do
know
what
to
think
for
my
part
and
yet
i
always
imagined
that
i
was
considered
a
friend
of
the
family
said
the
late
rector
with
an
aggrieved
look
he
took
his
glass
of
claret
very
slowly
looking
at
it
as
if
expecting
to
see
in
the
purple
reflection
some
explanation
of
the
mystery
as
for
gerald
wentworth
he
relapsed
into
silence
when
he
found
that
his
arguments
did
not
alter
frank
decision
he
too
was
disappointed
not
to
find
his
brother
alone
he
sat
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
a
singular
look
of
abstraction
on
his
face
he
had
got
into
a
new
atmosphere
a
different
world
when
his
anxieties
about
frank
were
satisfied
gerald
withdrew
himself
altogether
from
the
little
party
he
sat
there
it
is
true
not
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
and
even
from
time
to
time
joining
in
the
conversation
but
already
a
subtle
change
had
come
over
gerald
he
might
have
been
repeating
an
office
or
carrying
on
a
course
of
private
devotions
from
his
looks
rome
had
established
her
dualism
in
his
mind
he
had
no
longer
the
unity
of
an
englishman
trained
to
do
one
thing
at
a
time
and
to
do
it
with
his
might
he
sat
in
a
kind
of
languor
carrying
on
within
himself
a
thread
of
thought
to
which
his
external
occupation
gave
no
clue
yet
at
the
same
time
suffering
no
indication
to
escape
him
of
the
real
condition
of
his
mind
the
three
were
consequently
far
from
being
good
company
mr
proctor
who
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
as
to
the
true
state
of
the
case
could
not
unburden
himself
of
his
own
intentions
as
he
had
hoped
to
do
and
after
a
while
the
curate
too
was
silent
finding
his
statements
received
as
he
thought
but
coldly
it
was
a
great
relief
to
him
when
he
was
called
out
by
sarah
to
speak
to
some
one
though
his
absence
made
conversation
still
more
difficult
for
the
two
who
were
left
behind
mr
proctor
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
regarded
gerald
with
a
mixture
of
wonder
and
pity
he
did
not
feel
quite
sure
that
it
was
not
his
duty
to
speak
to
him
to
expound
the
superior
catholicity
of
the
church
of
england
and
call
his
attention
to
the
schismatic
peculiarities
of
the
church
of
rome
it
might
do
him
good
to
read
burgon
book
mr
proctor
said
to
himself
and
by
way
of
introducing
that
subject
he
began
to
talk
of
italy
which
was
not
a
bad
device
and
did
credit
to
his
invention
meanwhile
the
curate
had
gone
to
his
study
wondering
a
little
who
could
want
him
and
to
his
utter
bewilderment
found
his
aunt
dora
veiled
and
wrapped
up
in
a
great
shawl
oh
frank
my
dear
do
be
angry
i
could
help
coming
cried
miss
dora
come
and
sit
down
by
me
here
i
slipped
out
and
did
not
even
put
on
my
bonnet
that
nobody
might
know
oh
frank
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
am
so
afraid
you
have
been
wicked
i
have
just
seen
that
that
girl
i
saw
her
out
of
my
window
frank
do
jump
up
like
that
i
ca
go
on
telling
you
if
you
do
stay
quiet
here
aunt
let
me
understand
you
cried
the
curate
you
saw
whom
rosa
elsworthy
do
drive
me
desperate
as
all
the
others
do
with
their
stupidity
you
saw
her
when
where
oh
frank
frank
to
think
it
should
put
you
in
such
a
way
such
a
girl
as
that
oh
my
dear
boy
if
i
had
thought
you
cared
so
much
i
never
would
have
come
to
tell
you
it
was
to
encourage
you
it
was
oh
frank
frank
that
it
should
come
to
this
cried
miss
dora
shrinking
back
from
him
with
fright
and
horror
in
her
face
come
we
have
no
time
to
lose
said
the
curate
who
was
desperate
he
picked
up
her
shawl
which
had
fallen
on
the
floor
and
bundled
her
up
in
it
in
the
most
summary
way
come
aunt
dora
said
the
impetuous
young
man
you
know
you
were
always
my
kindest
friend
nobody
else
can
help
me
at
this
moment
i
feel
that
you
are
going
to
be
my
deliverer
come
aunt
dora
we
must
go
and
find
her
you
and
i
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
he
had
his
arm
round
her
holding
on
her
shawl
he
raised
her
up
from
her
chair
and
supported
her
looking
at
her
as
he
had
not
done
before
since
he
was
a
boy
at
school
miss
dora
thought
she
was
too
frightened
too
excited
to
cry
as
she
would
have
liked
to
do
but
the
proposal
was
so
terrible
and
unprecedented
that
she
leaned
back
trembling
on
her
nephew
arm
and
could
not
move
either
to
obey
or
to
resist
him
oh
frank
i
never
went
after
any
improper
person
in
my
life
gasped
aunt
dora
oh
my
dear
do
make
me
do
anything
that
is
wrong
they
will
say
it
is
my
fault
cried
the
poor
lady
gradually
feeling
herself
obliged
to
stand
on
her
feet
and
collect
her
forces
the
shawl
fell
back
from
her
shoulders
as
the
curate
withdrew
his
arm
you
have
lost
my
large
pin
cried
aunt
dora
in
despair
and
i
have
no
bonnet
and
oh
what
will
leonora
say
i
never
never
would
have
come
to
tell
you
if
i
had
thought
of
this
i
only
came
to
warn
you
frank
i
only
intended
yes
said
the
curate
the
emergency
was
momentous
and
he
dared
not
lose
patience
he
found
her
large
pin
even
while
she
stood
trembling
and
stuck
it
into
her
shawl
as
if
it
had
been
a
skewer
you
never
would
have
come
if
you
had
not
been
my
guardian
angel
said
the
deceitful
young
man
whose
heart
was
beating
high
with
anxiety
and
hope
nobody
else
would
do
for
me
what
you
are
going
to
do
but
i
have
always
had
confidence
in
my
aunt
dora
come
come
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
this
was
how
he
overcame
miss
dora
scruples
before
she
knew
what
had
happened
she
was
being
hurried
through
the
clear
summer
night
past
the
long
of
grange
lane
the
stars
were
shining
overhead
the
leaves
rustling
on
all
sides
in
the
soft
wind
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
in
the
long
line
of
darkling
road
miss
dora
had
no
breath
to
speak
however
much
disposed
she
might
have
been
she
could
not
remonstrate
having
full
occasion
for
all
her
forces
to
keep
her
feet
and
her
breath
when
mr
wentworth
paused
for
an
instant
to
ask
which
way
did
she
go
it
was
all
miss
dora
could
do
to
indicate
with
her
finger
the
dark
depths
of
prickett
lane
thither
she
was
immediately
carried
as
by
a
whirlwind
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
fastened
together
wildly
by
the
big
pin
with
nothing
but
little
satin
slippers
quite
unfit
for
the
exertion
required
of
them
with
an
agonised
protest
in
her
heart
that
she
had
never
never
in
her
life
gone
after
any
improper
person
before
and
crowning
misfortune
of
all
with
a
horrible
consciousness
that
she
had
left
the
open
hoping
to
return
in
a
few
minutes
miss
dora
wentworth
single
woman
as
she
was
and
ignorant
of
evil
was
whirled
off
in
pursuit
of
the
unfortunate
rosa
into
the
dark
abysses
of
prickett
lane
while
this
terrible
hegira
was
taking
place
mr
proctor
sat
opposite
gerald
wentworth
sipping
his
claret
and
talking
of
italy
perhaps
you
have
not
read
burgon
book
said
the
late
rector
there
is
a
good
deal
of
valuable
information
in
it
about
the
catacombs
and
he
enters
at
some
length
into
the
question
between
the
roman
church
and
our
own
if
you
are
interested
in
that
you
should
read
it
said
mr
proctor
it
is
a
very
important
question
yes
said
gerald
and
then
there
followed
a
pause
mr
proctor
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
faint
passing
smile
the
abstracted
look
which
he
had
vaguely
observed
all
the
evening
and
he
looked
so
inquiringly
across
the
table
that
gerald
dualism
came
immediately
into
play
to
the
great
amazement
of
his
companion
mr
wentworth
talked
and
talked
well
but
his
eyes
were
still
abstracted
his
mind
was
still
otherwise
occupied
and
mr
proctor
whose
own
intelligence
was
in
a
state
of
unusual
excitement
perceived
the
fact
without
being
at
all
able
to
explain
it
an
hour
passed
and
both
the
gentlemen
looked
at
their
watches
the
curate
had
left
them
abruptly
enough
with
little
apology
and
as
neither
of
them
had
much
interest
in
the
other
nor
in
the
conversation
it
was
natural
that
the
return
should
be
looked
for
with
some
anxiety
when
the
two
gentlemen
had
said
all
they
could
say
about
italy
when
mr
proctor
had
given
a
little
sketch
of
his
own
experiences
in
rome
to
which
his
companion
did
not
make
the
usual
response
of
narrating
his
the
two
came
to
a
dead
pause
they
had
now
been
sitting
for
more
than
two
hours
over
that
bottle
of
lafitte
many
thoughts
having
in
the
mean
time
crossed
mr
proctor
mind
concerning
the
coffee
and
the
curate
where
could
he
have
gone
and
why
was
there
not
somebody
in
the
house
with
sense
enough
to
clear
away
the
remains
of
dessert
and
refresh
the
wearied
interlocutors
with
the
black
and
fragrant
cup
which
cheers
all
students
both
of
the
gentlemen
had
become
seriously
uneasy
by
this
time
the
late
rector
got
up
from
the
table
when
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
your
brother
must
have
been
called
away
by
something
important
said
mr
proctor
stiffly
perhaps
you
will
kindly
make
my
excuses
mr
morgan
keeps
very
regular
hours
and
i
should
not
like
to
be
late
it
is
very
extraordinary
i
ca
fancy
what
can
be
the
reason
it
must
be
somebody
sick
said
gerald
rising
too
but
not
looking
by
any
means
sure
that
frank
absence
had
such
a
laudable
excuse
very
likely
said
the
late
rector
more
stiffly
than
ever
you
are
living
here
i
suppose
no
i
am
at
miss
wentworth
my
aunt
said
gerald
i
will
walk
with
you
and
they
went
out
together
with
minds
considerably
excited
both
looked
up
and
down
the
road
when
they
got
outside
the
both
had
a
vague
idea
that
the
curate
might
be
visible
somewhere
in
conversation
with
somebody
disreputable
and
one
being
his
friend
and
the
other
his
brother
they
were
almost
equally
disturbed
about
the
unfortunate
young
man
mr
proctor
thoughts
however
were
mingled
with
a
little
offence
he
had
meant
to
be
confidential
and
brotherly
and
the
occasion
had
been
lost
and
how
was
it
possible
to
explain
the
rudeness
with
which
mr
wentworth
had
treated
him
gerald
was
still
more
seriously
troubled
when
mr
proctor
left
him
he
walked
up
and
down
grange
lane
in
the
quiet
of
the
summer
night
watching
for
his
brother
jack
came
home
smoking
his
cigar
dropping
wodehouse
whom
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
declined
to
call
his
friend
before
he
reached
his
aunts
door
and
as
much
surprised
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
to
find
gerald
lingering
meditating
along
the
silent
road
but
still
frank
did
not
come
a
hurried
light
gleamed
in
the
window
of
the
and
sounds
of
commotion
were
audible
in
the
orderly
dwelling
of
the
miss
wentworths
and
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
the
appearance
of
miss
leonora
also
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
at
the
just
then
when
they
were
all
going
to
bed
collins
miss
dora
maid
had
come
to
the
in
search
of
her
mistress
she
was
not
to
be
found
anywhere
though
her
bonnets
and
all
her
outdoor
gear
were
safe
in
their
place
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
entire
family
were
startled
into
anxiety
on
miss
dora
account
as
for
mrs
gerald
wentworth
she
jumped
at
once
to
the
conclusion
that
the
poor
lady
was
murdered
and
that
frank
must
have
something
to
do
with
it
and
filled
the
house
with
lamentations
nobody
went
to
bed
not
even
aunt
cecilia
who
had
not
been
out
of
her
room
at
eleven
for
centuries
collins
had
gone
into
the
and
was
turning
over
everything
there
as
if
she
expected
to
find
her
mistress
body
in
the
cupboard
or
under
the
sofa
lewis
the
butler
was
hunting
through
the
garden
with
a
lantern
looking
under
all
the
bushes
no
incident
so
utterly
unaccountable
had
occurred
before
in
miss
dora
wentworth
life
chapter
xxxvi
the
first
investigation
into
the
character
of
the
rev
wentworth
curate
of
st
roque
was
fixed
to
take
place
in
the
vestry
of
the
parish
church
at
eleven
on
the
morning
of
the
day
which
followed
this
anxious
night
most
people
in
carlingford
were
aware
that
the
perpetual
curate
was
to
be
put
upon
his
trial
on
that
sunny
july
morning
and
there
was
naturally
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
among
the
intelligent
townsfolk
to
see
how
he
looked
and
what
was
the
aspect
of
the
witnesses
who
were
to
bear
testimony
for
or
against
him
it
is
always
interesting
to
the
crowd
to
see
how
a
man
looks
at
a
great
crisis
of
his
life
or
a
woman
either
for
that
matter
and
if
a
human
creature
at
the
height
of
joy
or
in
the
depths
of
sorrow
is
a
spectacle
to
draw
everybody
eyes
there
is
a
still
greater
dramatic
interest
in
the
sight
when
hope
and
fear
are
both
in
action
and
the
alternative
hangs
between
life
or
death
it
was
life
or
death
to
mr
wentworth
though
the
tribunal
was
one
which
could
inflict
no
penalties
if
he
should
be
found
guilty
death
would
be
a
light
doom
to
the
downfall
and
moral
extinction
which
would
make
an
end
of
the
unfaithful
priest
and
consequently
carlingford
had
reason
for
its
curiosity
there
was
a
crowd
about
the
back
entrance
which
led
to
the
shabby
little
sacristy
where
mr
morgan
and
mr
leeson
were
accustomed
to
robe
themselves
and
scores
of
people
strayed
into
the
church
itself
and
hung
about
pretending
to
look
at
the
improvements
which
the
rector
called
restorations
mrs
morgan
herself
looking
very
pale
was
in
and
out
times
in
the
hour
talking
with
terrible
science
and
technicalism
to
mr
finial
clerk
of
works
who
could
not
make
her
see
that
she
was
talking
gothic
a
language
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
carlingford
church
that
building
being
of
the
revolution
or
churchwarden
epoch
she
was
a
great
deal
too
much
agitated
at
that
moment
to
be
aware
of
the
distinction
as
for
mr
wentworth
it
was
universally
agreed
that
though
he
looked
a
little
flushed
and
excited
there
was
no
particular
discouragement
visible
in
his
face
he
went
in
to
the
vestry
with
some
eagerness
not
much
like
a
culprit
on
his
trial
the
rector
indeed
who
was
heated
and
embarrassed
and
doubtful
of
himself
looked
more
like
a
criminal
than
the
real
hero
there
were
six
of
the
amateur
judges
of
whom
one
had
felt
his
heart
fail
him
at
the
last
moment
the
five
who
were
steadfast
were
mr
morgan
dr
marjoribanks
old
mr
western
who
was
a
distant
cousin
of
the
wodehouses
and
though
old
enough
to
be
her
grandfather
of
the
beautiful
lady
western
who
once
lived
in
grange
lane
and
with
them
mr
centum
the
banker
and
old
colonel
chiley
mr
proctor
who
was
very
uneasy
in
his
mind
and
much
afraid
lest
he
should
be
called
upon
to
give
an
account
of
the
curate
behaviour
on
the
previous
night
had
added
himself
as
a
kind
of
auxiliary
to
this
judicial
bench
mr
waters
had
volunteered
his
services
as
counsellor
perhaps
with
the
intention
of
looking
after
the
interests
of
a
very
different
client
and
to
this
imposing
assembly
john
brown
had
walked
in
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
rather
disturbing
the
composure
of
the
company
in
general
who
were
aware
what
kind
of
criticism
his
was
while
the
bed
of
justice
was
being
arranged
a
very
odd
little
group
collected
in
the
outer
room
where
elsworthy
in
a
feverish
state
of
excitement
was
revolving
about
the
place
from
the
door
to
the
window
and
where
the
miss
hemmings
sat
up
against
the
wall
with
their
drapery
drawn
up
about
them
to
show
that
they
were
of
different
clay
from
mrs
elsworthy
who
respectful
but
sullen
sat
on
the
same
bench
the
anxious
public
peered
in
at
the
door
whenever
it
had
a
chance
and
took
peeps
through
the
window
when
the
other
privilege
was
impossible
besides
the
miss
hemmings
and
the
elsworthys
there
was
peter
hayles
who
also
had
seen
something
and
the
wife
of
another
shopkeeper
at
the
end
of
george
street
and
there
was
the
miss
hemmings
maid
who
had
escorted
them
on
that
eventful
night
of
disappearance
not
one
of
the
witnesses
had
the
smallest
doubt
as
to
the
statement
he
or
she
was
about
to
make
they
were
entirely
convinced
of
the
righteousness
of
their
own
cause
and
the
justice
of
the
accusation
which
naturally
gave
a
wonderful
moral
force
to
their
testimony
besides
but
that
was
quite
a
different
matter
they
all
had
their
little
grudges
against
mr
wentworth
each
in
his
secret
heart
when
elsworthy
was
called
in
to
the
inner
room
it
caused
a
little
commotion
amid
this
company
outside
the
miss
hemmings
looked
at
each
other
not
with
an
agreeable
expression
of
face
they
might
have
had
the
politeness
to
call
us
first
miss
sophia
said
to
her
sister
and
miss
hemmings
shook
her
head
and
sighed
and
said
dear
mr
bury
an
observation
which
meant
a
great
deal
though
it
did
not
seem
perfectly
relevant
laws
i
forget
everything
when
i
took
in
there
said
the
shopkeeper
wife
to
miss
hemmings
maid
and
the
ladies
drew
still
closer
up
superior
to
curiosity
while
the
others
stretched
their
necks
to
get
a
peep
into
the
terrible
inner
room
it
was
indeed
a
formidable
tribunal
the
room
was
small
so
that
the
unfortunate
witness
was
within
the
closest
range
of
six
pairs
of
judicial
eyes
not
to
speak
of
the
vigilant
orbs
of
the
two
lawyers
and
those
of
the
accused
and
his
supporters
mr
morgan
by
right
of
his
position
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
looked
very
severely
at
the
first
witness
as
he
came
in
which
elsworthy
did
carrying
his
hat
before
him
like
a
kind
of
shield
and
polishing
it
carefully
round
and
round
the
rector
was
far
from
having
any
intention
of
discouraging
the
witness
who
was
indeed
his
mainstay
but
the
anxiety
of
his
peculiar
position
as
being
at
once
counsel
for
the
prosecution
and
chief
magistrate
of
the
bed
of
justice
gave
an
unusual
sternness
to
his
face
your
name
is
george
elsworthy
said
the
rector
filling
his
pen
with
ink
and
looking
penetratingly
in
the
witness
face
george
appleby
elsworthy
said
rosa
uncle
a
little
alarmed
not
as
i
often
signs
in
full
for
you
see
sir
it
a
long
name
and
life
short
and
it
aint
necessary
in
the
way
of
business
stationer
and
newsmonger
in
carlingford
interrupted
the
rector
i
should
say
in
upper
grange
lane
carlingford
aged
but
it
does
appear
to
me
that
newsmonger
is
a
correct
expression
said
old
mr
western
who
was
very
conversational
newsmonger
means
a
gossip
not
a
tradesman
not
that
there
is
any
reason
why
a
tradesman
should
not
be
a
gossip
but
aged
said
mr
morgan
holding
his
pen
suspended
in
the
air
i
will
say
newsvendor
if
that
will
be
better
one
can
not
be
too
particular
aged
he
is
come
to
years
of
discretion
said
dr
marjoribanks
that
all
we
need
do
keep
us
all
day
waiting
man
but
tell
your
story
about
this
elopement
of
your
niece
when
did
it
take
place
and
what
are
the
facts
never
mind
your
hat
but
say
out
what
you
have
got
to
say
you
are
much
too
summary
doctor
said
mr
morgan
with
a
little
offence
but
the
sense
of
the
assembly
was
clearly
with
dr
marjoribanks
so
that
the
rector
dashed
in
as
the
probable
age
of
the
witness
and
waited
his
further
statement
after
this
there
was
silence
and
elsworthy
began
his
story
he
narrated
all
the
facts
of
rosa
disappearance
with
an
intention
and
bias
which
made
his
true
tale
a
wonderful
tacit
accusation
rage
revenge
a
sense
of
wrong
worked
what
in
an
indifferent
narrator
only
the
highest
skill
could
have
wrought
he
did
not
mention
the
name
but
arranged
all
his
facts
in
lines
like
so
many
trains
of
artillery
how
rosa
was
in
the
habit
of
going
to
mrs
hadwin
it
was
contrary
to
elsworthy
instinct
to
bring
in
at
this
moment
any
reference
to
mr
wentworth
every
night
with
the
newspaper
not
as
i
sent
her
of
errands
for
common
keeping
two
boys
for
the
purpose
said
the
injured
man
but
right
or
wrong
there
where
she
go
as
certain
as
the
night
come
i
seen
her
with
my
own
eyes
go
into
mrs
hadwin
which
she
had
no
need
to
go
in
but
for
being
encouraged
and
it
would
be
half
an
hour
at
the
least
afore
she
came
out
but
bless
me
that
was
very
imprudent
of
you
cried
mr
proctor
who
up
to
this
time
had
not
uttered
a
word
there
was
nobody
there
but
the
old
lady
and
her
maids
except
the
clergyman
said
elsworthy
it
was
my
part
to
think
as
she
could
get
any
harm
from
the
clergyman
she
would
hear
no
remonstrances
from
me
she
go
as
regular
as
the
evening
come
yes
yes
said
mr
waters
who
saw
john
brown
humorous
eye
gleaming
round
upon
the
little
assembly
but
let
us
come
to
the
immediate
matter
in
hand
your
niece
disappeared
from
carlingford
on
the
yes
yes
said
mr
western
we
must
not
sink
into
conversation
that
the
danger
of
all
unofficial
investigations
it
seems
natural
to
let
him
tell
his
story
as
he
likes
but
here
we
have
got
somebody
to
keep
us
in
order
it
natural
but
it
aint
law
is
it
brown
i
do
see
that
law
has
anything
to
do
with
it
said
john
brown
with
a
smile
order
order
said
the
rector
who
was
much
goaded
and
aggravated
by
this
remark
i
request
that
there
may
be
no
conversation
the
witness
will
proceed
with
what
he
has
to
say
your
niece
disappeared
on
the
what
were
the
circumstances
of
her
going
away
she
went
down
as
usual
with
the
newspaper
said
elsworthy
it
had
got
to
be
a
custom
as
regular
as
regular
she
stopped
out
later
nor
common
and
my
wife
and
me
was
put
out
i
do
mind
saying
gentlemen
said
the
witness
with
candour
as
my
missis
and
i
was
altogether
of
the
same
mind
about
rosa
she
was
late
but
i
ca
say
as
i
was
anxious
it
was
above
a
week
afore
that
mr
wentworth
himself
brought
her
home
safe
and
it
was
well
known
as
he
did
like
her
to
be
out
at
night
so
i
was
easy
in
my
mind
like
but
when
eleven
came
and
there
was
no
denying
of
its
being
past
hours
i
began
to
get
a
little
fidgety
i
stepped
out
to
the
door
and
i
looked
up
and
down
and
saw
nobody
so
i
took
up
my
hat
and
took
a
turn
down
the
road
at
this
moment
there
was
a
little
disturbance
outside
a
voice
at
which
the
curate
started
was
audible
asking
entrance
i
must
see
mr
wentworth
immediately
this
voice
said
as
the
door
was
partially
opened
and
then
while
his
sons
both
rose
to
their
feet
the
squire
himself
suddenly
entered
the
room
he
looked
round
upon
the
assembled
company
with
a
glance
of
shame
and
grief
that
went
to
the
heart
then
he
bowed
to
the
judges
who
were
looking
at
him
with
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
his
identity
and
walked
across
the
room
to
the
bench
on
which
gerald
and
frank
were
seated
together
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
said
the
squire
if
i
interrupt
your
proceedings
but
i
have
only
this
moment
arrived
in
carlingford
and
heard
what
was
going
on
and
i
trust
i
may
be
allowed
to
remain
as
my
son
honour
is
concerned
mr
wentworth
scarcely
waited
for
the
assent
which
everybody
united
in
murmuring
but
seated
himself
heavily
on
the
bench
as
if
glad
to
sit
down
anywhere
he
suffered
frank
to
grasp
his
hand
but
scarcely
gave
it
nor
indeed
did
he
look
except
once
with
a
bitter
momentary
glance
at
the
brothers
they
were
sons
a
father
might
well
have
been
proud
of
so
far
as
external
appearances
went
but
the
squire
soul
was
bitter
within
him
one
was
about
to
abandon
all
that
made
life
valuable
in
the
eyes
of
the
country
gentleman
the
other
and
i
could
have
sworn
by
frank
the
mortified
father
was
saying
in
his
heart
he
sat
down
with
a
dull
dogged
composure
he
meant
to
hear
it
all
and
have
it
proved
to
him
that
his
favourite
son
was
a
villain
no
wonder
that
he
was
disinclined
to
respond
to
any
courtesies
he
set
himself
down
almost
with
impatience
that
the
sound
of
his
entrance
should
have
interrupted
the
narrative
and
looked
straight
in
front
of
him
fixing
his
eyes
on
elsworthy
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
anxious
glances
of
the
possible
culprit
at
his
side
i
had
gone
above
a
step
or
two
when
i
see
mr
hayles
at
his
door
i
said
to
him
a
fine
evening
as
so
it
was
and
the
stars
shining
rosa
aint
been
about
your
place
has
she
i
says
and
he
says
but
gentlemen
i
see
by
the
look
of
his
eye
as
he
had
more
to
say
she
come
home
yet
says
mr
hayles
stop
a
moment
said
john
brown
peter
hayles
is
outside
i
think
if
the
rector
wishes
to
preserve
any
sort
of
legal
form
in
this
inquiry
may
i
suggest
that
a
conversation
repeated
is
not
evidence
let
elsworthy
tell
what
he
knows
and
the
other
can
speak
for
himself
it
is
essential
we
should
hear
the
conversation
said
the
rector
since
i
believe
it
was
of
importance
i
believe
it
is
an
important
link
in
the
evidence
i
believe
mr
morgan
apparently
has
heard
the
evidence
before
said
the
inexorable
john
brown
here
a
little
commotion
arose
in
the
bed
of
justice
hush
hush
said
dr
marjoribanks
the
question
is
what
has
the
witness
got
to
say
of
his
own
knowledge
go
on
elsworthy
we
ca
possibly
spend
the
whole
day
here
never
mind
what
hayles
said
unless
he
communicated
something
about
the
girl
he
told
me
as
the
miss
hemmings
had
seen
rosa
said
elsworthy
slowly
had
seen
her
at
nine
or
half
after
nine
i
wo
be
sure
which
at
mrs
hadwin
gate
the
miss
hemmings
are
outside
let
the
miss
hemmings
be
called
said
mr
proctor
who
had
a
great
respect
for
mr
brown
opinion
but
here
mr
waters
interposed
the
miss
hemmings
will
be
called
presently
he
said
in
the
mean
time
let
this
witness
be
heard
out
afterwards
his
evidence
will
be
corroborated
go
on
elsworthy
the
miss
hemmings
had
seen
my
rosa
at
mrs
hadwin
gate
repeated
elsworthy
outside
and
mr
wentworth
inside
there
aint
more
respectable
parties
in
all
carlingford
it
was
them
as
saw
it
not
me
gentlemen
i
went
back
home
i
went
out
again
i
went
over
all
the
town
for
her
six
in
the
morning
come
and
i
had
never
closed
an
eye
nor
took
off
my
clothes
nor
even
sat
down
upon
a
chair
when
it
was
an
hour
as
i
could
go
to
a
house
and
no
offence
i
went
to
the
place
as
she
was
last
seen
me
and
mr
hayles
we
went
together
the
shutters
was
all
shut
but
on
one
window
which
was
mr
wentworth
study
we
knocked
at
the
and
i
aint
pretending
that
we
did
make
a
noise
and
gentlemen
it
was
none
of
the
servants
it
was
mr
wentworth
hisself
as
opened
the
door
there
was
here
a
visible
sensation
among
the
judges
it
was
a
point
that
told
as
for
the
squire
he
set
his
stick
firmly
before
him
and
leaned
his
clasped
hands
upon
it
to
steady
himself
his
healthful
ruddy
countenance
was
paling
gradually
if
it
had
been
an
apostle
who
spoke
he
could
not
have
taken
in
more
entirely
the
bitter
tale
it
was
mr
wentworth
hisself
gentlemen
said
the
triumphant
witness
not
like
a
man
roused
out
of
his
sleep
but
dressed
and
shaved
and
his
hair
brushed
as
if
it
had
been
ten
instead
o
six
it
well
known
in
carlingford
as
he
aint
an
early
man
and
gentlemen
here
knows
it
as
well
as
me
i
do
pretend
as
i
could
keep
my
temper
i
give
him
my
mind
gentlemen
being
an
injured
man
but
i
said
as
if
he
do
his
duty
by
her
softly
a
moment
said
mr
brown
what
had
mr
wentworth
aspect
at
six
in
the
morning
to
do
with
rosa
elsworthy
disappearance
at
nine
on
the
previous
night
i
do
see
that
the
question
is
called
for
at
the
present
moment
said
mr
waters
let
us
hear
what
reasons
you
have
for
attributing
to
mr
wentworth
an
unusual
degree
of
interest
in
your
niece
sir
said
elsworthy
he
come
into
my
shop
as
regular
as
the
day
he
never
come
but
he
asked
after
rosa
or
spoke
to
her
if
she
was
there
one
night
he
walked
all
the
way
up
grange
lane
and
knocked
at
my
door
and
brought
her
in
all
of
a
glow
and
said
i
was
to
send
her
out
late
no
more
my
missis
being
a
woman
as
is
very
particular
was
struck
and
thought
as
harm
might
come
of
it
and
not
to
be
talked
of
we
sent
rosa
away
and
what
does
mr
wentworth
do
but
the
moment
he
hears
of
it
comes
right
off
to
my
shop
he
had
been
at
his
own
home
sir
his
respected
family
said
elsworthy
turning
slightly
towards
the
side
of
the
room
where
the
father
and
sons
sat
together
he
came
to
my
shop
with
his
as
he
come
off
the
railway
and
he
gave
me
my
orders
as
i
was
to
bring
rosa
back
what
he
said
was
that
very
day
i
never
had
no
thought
but
what
his
meaning
was
honourable
being
a
clergyman
said
the
witness
with
a
heavy
sigh
and
then
there
ensued
a
little
pause
the
miss
hemmings
had
better
be
called
now
said
mr
waters
elsworthy
you
can
retire
but
we
may
require
you
again
so
you
had
better
not
go
away
request
miss
hemmings
to
do
us
the
favour
of
coming
here
the
squire
lifted
his
heavy
eyes
when
the
next
witness
entered
she
made
a
very
solemn
curtsy
to
the
gentlemen
and
sat
down
on
the
chair
which
somebody
placed
for
her
being
unsupported
a
lady
not
to
say
an
unmarried
lady
profoundly
conscious
of
the
fact
among
a
number
of
men
miss
hemmings
was
naturally
much
agitated
she
was
the
eldest
and
the
and
it
occurred
to
her
for
the
first
time
as
she
gave
a
frightened
look
towards
the
curate
that
he
was
like
her
favourite
younger
brother
who
had
died
ever
so
many
years
ago
a
thought
which
for
the
first
time
made
her
doubtful
of
her
testimony
and
disposed
to
break
down
in
her
evidence
you
were
in
grange
lane
on
the
evening
of
the
ultimo
said
mr
morgan
after
he
had
carefully
written
down
her
name
about
nine
oh
yes
mr
morgan
said
the
poor
lady
we
were
at
st
cottage
drinking
tea
with
mrs
bland
who
was
lodging
with
mrs
smith
in
the
same
rooms
mrs
rider
used
to
have
i
put
the
note
of
invitation
in
my
pocket
in
case
there
should
be
any
doubt
but
indeed
poor
mrs
bland
was
taken
very
ill
on
the
and
dr
marjoribanks
was
called
and
he
knows
it
could
not
be
any
other
evening
and
besides
about
nine
said
mr
waters
did
i
understand
you
it
was
about
nine
she
was
such
an
invalid
poor
dear
said
miss
hemmings
apologetically
and
it
is
such
a
privilege
to
have
real
christian
conversation
we
dined
early
on
purpose
and
we
were
asked
for
six
i
think
it
must
have
been
a
little
after
nine
but
mary
is
here
and
she
knows
what
hour
she
came
for
us
shall
i
call
mary
please
presently
said
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
do
be
agitated
one
or
two
questions
will
do
you
passed
mrs
hadwin
door
coming
up
will
you
kindly
tell
the
gentlemen
what
you
saw
there
oh
cried
miss
hemmings
she
looked
round
at
the
curate
again
and
he
was
more
than
ever
like
willie
who
died
i
i
do
take
much
notice
of
what
i
see
in
the
streets
she
said
faltering
and
there
are
always
so
many
poor
people
going
to
see
mr
wentworth
here
the
poor
lady
stopped
short
she
had
never
considered
before
what
harm
her
evidence
might
do
now
her
heart
smote
her
for
the
young
man
who
was
like
willie
he
is
so
very
kind
to
all
the
poor
people
continued
the
unwilling
witness
looking
doubtfully
round
into
all
the
faces
near
her
and
he
such
a
young
man
she
added
in
her
tremulous
way
it
was
miss
sophia
who
was
all
the
poor
women
in
back
grove
street
were
perfectly
aware
that
their
chances
were
doubled
when
they
found
miss
jane
but
you
must
tell
us
what
you
saw
all
the
same
said
dr
marjoribanks
i
daresay
mr
wentworth
wishes
it
as
much
as
we
do
the
curate
got
up
and
came
forward
with
one
of
his
impulses
i
wish
it
a
great
deal
more
he
said
my
dear
miss
hemmings
thank
you
for
your
reluctance
to
say
anything
to
harm
me
but
the
truth
possibly
harm
me
tell
them
exactly
what
you
saw
miss
hemmings
looked
from
one
to
another
and
trembled
more
and
more
i
am
sure
i
never
meant
to
injure
mr
wentworth
she
said
i
only
said
i
thought
it
was
imprudent
of
him
that
was
all
i
meant
oh
i
am
sure
if
i
had
thought
of
this
i
would
rather
have
done
anything
than
say
it
and
whatever
sophia
might
have
imagined
i
assure
you
gentlemen
never
never
for
a
moment
thought
mr
wentworth
meant
any
harm
never
mind
mr
wentworth
said
mr
brown
who
now
took
the
matter
in
hand
when
you
were
passing
mrs
hadwin
house
about
nine
on
the
evening
of
the
you
saw
some
one
standing
at
the
door
mr
wentworth
particularly
wishes
you
to
say
who
it
was
oh
mr
brown
oh
mr
morgan
cried
the
poor
lady
it
was
little
rosa
elsworthy
she
was
a
designing
little
artful
thing
when
she
was
in
my
sunday
class
she
was
always
thinking
of
her
vanities
mr
wentworth
was
talking
to
her
at
the
i
daresay
he
was
giving
her
good
advice
and
oh
gentlemen
if
you
were
to
question
me
for
ever
and
ever
that
is
all
i
have
got
to
say
did
you
not
hear
what
they
were
talking
about
said
mr
proctor
if
it
was
good
advice
the
late
rector
stopped
short
and
grew
red
and
felt
that
his
supposition
was
that
of
a
simpleton
you
heard
what
they
were
talking
about
what
did
they
say
he
concluded
peremptorily
in
a
tone
which
frightened
the
reluctant
witness
more
and
more
i
did
not
hear
a
single
word
she
cried
not
a
word
that
is
all
i
know
about
it
oh
please
let
me
go
away
i
feel
very
faint
i
should
like
a
little
cold
water
please
i
did
not
hear
a
word
not
a
word
i
have
told
you
everything
i
have
got
to
say
everybody
looked
more
serious
when
miss
hemmings
stumbled
from
her
chair
she
was
so
frightened
at
her
own
testimony
and
so
unwilling
to
give
it
that
its
importance
was
doubled
in
the
eyes
of
the
inexperienced
judges
the
squire
gave
a
low
groan
under
his
breath
and
turned
his
eyes
which
had
been
fixed
upon
her
on
the
ground
instead
but
raised
them
immediately
with
a
gleam
of
anxiety
as
his
son
again
rose
from
his
side
all
that
the
curate
meant
to
do
was
to
give
the
trembling
lady
his
arm
and
lead
her
out
but
the
entire
assembly
with
the
exception
of
john
brown
started
and
stared
as
if
he
had
been
about
to
take
instant
revenge
upon
the
frightened
woman
miss
hemmings
burst
into
tears
when
mr
wentworth
set
a
chair
for
her
by
the
door
and
brought
her
a
glass
of
water
in
the
outer
room
and
just
then
somebody
knocked
and
gave
him
a
note
with
which
he
returned
to
the
presence
of
the
awful
tribunal
miss
sophia
hemmings
was
corroborating
her
sister
statement
when
the
perpetual
curate
he
stood
behind
her
quite
quietly
until
she
had
finished
with
a
slight
smile
upon
his
lips
and
the
note
in
his
hand
dr
marjoribanks
was
not
partial
to
miss
sophia
hemmings
she
was
never
ill
herself
and
rarely
permitted
even
her
sister
to
enjoy
the
gentle
satisfaction
of
a
day
sickness
the
old
doctor
looked
instead
at
the
perpetual
curate
when
miss
hemmings
withdrew
dr
marjoribanks
interposed
it
appears
to
me
that
mr
wentworth
has
something
to
say
said
the
doctor
it
is
quite
necessary
that
he
should
have
a
hearing
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
let
peter
hayles
wait
a
moment
till
we
hear
what
mr
wentworth
has
to
say
it
is
not
yet
time
for
us
to
receive
mr
wentworth
statement
said
the
rector
he
shall
certainly
be
heard
in
his
own
defence
at
the
proper
time
mr
waters
call
peter
hayles
one
moment
said
the
curate
i
have
no
statement
to
make
and
i
can
wait
till
you
have
heard
what
everybody
has
to
say
if
the
rector
wishes
it
but
it
might
save
time
and
trouble
to
hear
me
i
have
another
witness
whom
up
to
this
moment
i
have
been
reluctant
to
bring
forward
a
witness
for
me
whom
i
can
not
produce
in
so
public
a
place
or
at
an
hour
when
everybody
is
abroad
if
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
adjourn
this
inquiry
till
the
evening
and
to
meet
then
in
a
private
house
in
my
own
or
miss
wentworth
or
wherever
you
may
appoint
i
think
i
can
undertake
to
make
this
whole
business
perfectly
clear
bless
me
said
mr
proctor
suddenly
this
unexpected
and
irrelevant
benediction
was
the
first
sound
distinctly
audible
in
the
little
stir
of
surprise
expectation
and
excitement
which
followed
the
speech
the
squire
let
his
stick
fall
out
of
his
hands
and
groped
after
it
to
pick
it
up
again
hope
had
suddenly
all
at
once
come
into
possession
of
the
old
man
breast
as
for
the
rector
he
was
too
much
annoyed
at
the
moment
to
speak
you
should
have
thought
of
this
before
said
dr
marjoribanks
it
would
have
been
just
as
easy
to
fix
this
meeting
for
the
evening
and
in
a
private
house
and
would
have
saved
time
you
are
very
welcome
to
my
if
you
please
but
i
do
understand
why
it
could
not
have
been
settled
so
at
once
and
saved
our
time
said
the
doctor
to
which
sentiment
there
were
several
murmurs
of
assent
gentlemen
said
the
curate
whose
eyes
were
sparkling
with
excitement
you
must
all
know
in
your
hearts
that
this
trial
ought
never
to
have
taken
place
i
have
lived
among
you
for
five
years
and
you
ought
to
have
known
me
by
this
time
i
have
never
been
asked
for
an
explanation
neither
could
any
explanation
which
it
was
possible
for
me
to
make
have
convinced
a
mind
prejudiced
against
me
he
said
after
a
moment
pause
with
a
meaning
which
everybody
understood
it
is
only
now
that
i
feel
myself
able
to
clear
up
the
whole
matter
and
it
is
for
this
reason
alone
that
i
ask
you
to
put
off
your
inquiry
till
i
do
feel
inclined
to
consent
to
any
adjournment
said
mr
morgan
it
looks
like
an
attempt
to
defeat
the
ends
of
justice
the
rector
was
very
much
annoyed
more
than
he
dared
confess
to
himself
he
believed
in
his
heart
that
young
wentworth
was
guilty
and
he
felt
equally
convinced
that
here
was
some
unexpected
loophole
through
which
he
would
escape
but
public
opinion
was
strong
in
grange
lane
stronger
than
a
new
rector
the
banker
and
the
doctor
and
the
indian
colonel
not
to
speak
of
old
mr
western
were
disposed
to
grant
the
request
of
the
curate
and
when
even
mr
proctor
forsook
his
side
the
rector
himself
yielded
though
it
is
against
my
judgment
he
said
and
i
see
no
advantage
to
be
gained
by
it
the
meeting
had
better
be
held
in
the
rectory
this
evening
at
seven
most
of
us
dine
at
seven
said
dr
marjoribanks
this
evening
at
eight
said
the
rector
severely
i
will
request
all
the
witnesses
to
be
in
attendance
and
we
must
hope
to
find
mr
wentworth
witness
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
the
change
at
eight
this
evening
in
my
house
gentlemen
said
the
rector
he
collected
his
notes
and
went
outside
and
began
talking
to
his
witnesses
while
the
others
collected
together
round
the
table
to
consult
over
this
new
phase
of
the
affair
the
three
mr
wentworths
went
out
together
the
father
between
his
two
tall
sons
the
strength
was
much
shaken
both
in
mind
and
body
when
they
were
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
church
he
looked
up
in
frank
face
i
hope
you
consider
me
entitled
to
an
immediate
explanation
said
mr
wentworth
when
i
read
that
anonymous
letter
it
went
a
long
way
towards
breaking
my
heart
sir
i
can
tell
you
it
did
jack
here
too
and
your
brother
making
up
his
mind
as
he
has
done
frank
i
am
not
a
man
to
complain
if
it
were
all
over
with
me
i
should
be
sorry
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
if
it
were
for
the
girls
and
the
little
children
but
i
always
thought
i
could
have
sworn
by
frank
said
the
old
man
mournfully
he
was
ever
so
much
older
since
he
had
said
these
words
before
in
the
long
lime
avenue
at
wentworth
hall
chapter
xxxvii
the
little
assembly
which
met
in
the
vestry
of
carlingford
church
to
inquire
into
the
conduct
of
the
perpetual
curate
had
so
many
different
interests
in
hands
when
it
dispersed
and
so
much
to
do
that
it
is
difficult
for
the
narrator
of
this
history
to
decide
which
thread
should
be
taken
up
first
of
all
the
interlocutors
however
perhaps
mr
proctor
was
the
one
who
had
least
succeeded
in
his
efforts
to
explain
himself
and
accordingly
demands
in
the
first
place
the
attention
of
an
impartial
historian
the
excellent
man
was
still
labouring
under
much
perplexity
when
the
bed
of
justice
was
broken
up
he
began
to
recollect
that
mr
wentworth
explanation
on
the
previous
night
had
convinced
him
of
his
innocence
and
to
see
that
it
was
indeed
altogether
inconceivable
that
the
curate
should
be
guilty
but
then
other
matters
still
more
disagreeable
to
contemplate
than
mr
wentworth
guilt
came
in
to
darken
the
picture
this
vagabond
wodehouse
whom
the
curate
had
taken
in
at
his
sister
request
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
mystery
mr
proctor
had
never
been
anyhow
connected
with
mysteries
he
was
himself
an
only
son
and
had
lived
a
straightforward
peaceable
life
neither
he
nor
his
estimable
parents
so
far
as
the
late
rector
was
aware
had
ever
done
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
and
he
winced
a
little
at
the
thought
of
connecting
himself
with
concealment
and
secrecy
and
then
the
sudden
disappearance
on
the
previous
evening
perplexed
and
troubled
him
he
imagined
all
kinds
of
reasons
for
it
as
he
walked
down
grange
lane
perhaps
miss
wodehouse
who
would
not
receive
himself
had
sent
for
mr
wentworth
perhaps
the
vagabond
brother
was
in
some
other
scrape
out
of
which
he
had
to
be
extricated
by
the
curate
assistance
mr
proctor
was
perfectly
honest
and
indeed
determined
in
his
intentions
but
everybody
will
allow
that
for
a
lover
of
fifty
or
thereabouts
contemplating
a
sensible
match
with
a
lady
of
suitable
years
and
means
to
find
suddenly
that
the
object
of
his
affections
was
not
only
a
penniless
woman
but
the
natural
guardian
of
an
equally
penniless
sister
was
startling
to
say
the
least
of
it
he
was
a
true
man
and
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
decline
the
responsibility
altogether
on
the
contrary
he
was
perhaps
more
eager
than
he
would
have
been
otherwise
seeing
that
his
elderly
love
had
far
more
need
of
his
devotion
than
he
had
ever
expected
her
to
have
but
notwithstanding
he
was
disturbed
by
such
an
change
of
circumstances
as
was
natural
and
did
not
quite
know
what
was
to
be
done
with
lucy
he
was
full
of
thoughts
on
this
subject
as
he
proceeded
towards
the
house
to
the
interview
which
to
use
sentimental
language
was
to
decide
his
fate
but
to
tell
the
truth
mr
proctor
was
not
in
a
state
of
very
deep
anxiety
about
his
fate
the
idea
of
being
refused
was
too
unreasonable
an
idea
to
gain
much
ground
in
his
mind
he
was
going
to
offer
his
personal
support
affection
and
sympathy
to
miss
wodehouse
at
the
least
fortunate
moment
in
her
life
and
if
there
was
anything
consolatory
in
marriage
at
all
the
late
rector
sensibly
concluded
that
it
must
be
doubly
comforting
under
such
circumstances
and
that
the
offer
of
an
honest
man
hand
and
house
and
income
was
not
a
likely
thing
to
be
rejected
by
a
woman
of
miss
wodehouse
experience
and
good
sense
not
to
speak
of
his
heart
which
was
very
honest
and
true
and
affectionate
though
it
had
outlived
the
fervours
of
youth
such
was
mr
proctor
view
of
the
matter
and
the
chances
were
strong
that
miss
wodehouse
entirely
agreed
with
him
so
but
for
a
certain
shyness
which
made
him
rather
nervous
it
would
not
be
correct
to
say
that
the
late
rector
was
in
a
state
of
special
anxiety
about
the
answer
he
was
likely
to
receive
he
was
however
anxious
about
lucy
his
bachelor
mind
was
familiar
with
all
the
ordinary
traditions
about
the
inexpediency
of
being
surrounded
by
a
wife
family
and
he
had
a
little
of
the
primitive
male
sentiment
shared
one
way
or
other
by
most
husbands
that
the
old
system
of
buying
a
woman
right
out
and
carrying
her
off
for
his
own
sole
and
private
satisfaction
was
after
all
the
correct
way
of
managing
such
matters
to
be
sure
a
pretty
young
unmarried
sister
was
perhaps
the
least
objectionable
encumbrance
a
woman
could
have
but
notwithstanding
mr
proctor
would
have
been
glad
could
he
have
seen
any
feasible
way
of
disposing
of
lucy
it
was
utterly
out
of
the
question
to
think
of
her
going
out
as
a
governess
and
it
was
quite
evident
that
mr
wentworth
even
were
he
perfectly
cleared
of
every
imputation
having
himself
nothing
to
live
upon
could
scarcely
offer
to
share
his
poverty
with
poor
mr
wodehouse
cherished
pet
and
darling
i
daresay
she
has
been
used
to
live
expensively
mr
proctor
said
to
himself
wincing
a
little
in
his
own
mind
at
the
thought
it
was
about
one
when
he
reached
the
green
door
an
hour
at
which
during
the
few
months
of
his
incumbency
at
carlingford
he
had
often
presented
himself
at
that
hospitable
house
poor
mr
wodehouse
mr
proctor
could
not
help
wondering
at
that
moment
how
he
was
getting
on
in
a
world
where
according
to
ordinary
ideas
there
are
no
lunch
nor
dinner
parties
no
old
port
nor
savoury
somehow
it
was
impossible
to
realise
mr
wodehouse
with
other
surroundings
than
those
of
and
mr
proctor
sighed
half
for
the
departed
half
at
thought
of
the
strangeness
of
that
unknown
life
for
which
he
himself
did
not
feel
much
more
fitted
than
mr
wodehouse
in
the
garden
he
saw
the
new
heir
sulkily
marching
about
among
the
smoking
and
looking
almost
as
much
out
of
place
in
the
sweet
tranquillity
of
the
english
garden
as
a
churchwarden
of
carlingford
or
a
fellow
of
could
look
to
carry
out
mr
proctor
previous
imagination
in
the
vague
beatitude
of
a
disembodied
heaven
wodehouse
was
so
sick
of
his
own
company
that
he
came
hastily
forward
at
the
sight
of
a
visitor
but
shrank
a
little
when
he
saw
who
it
was
i
suppose
you
have
brought
some
news
he
said
in
his
sullen
way
i
suppose
he
has
been
making
his
statements
has
he
much
i
care
he
may
tell
what
lies
he
pleases
he
ca
do
me
any
harm
i
never
did
anything
but
sign
my
own
name
by
jove
jack
wentworth
himself
says
so
i
do
care
for
the
parson
and
his
threats
said
wodehouse
snapping
his
fingers
in
mr
proctor
face
the
late
rector
drew
back
a
little
with
a
shudder
of
disgust
and
resentment
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
this
fellow
would
most
likely
be
his
presently
and
the
horror
he
felt
made
itself
visible
in
his
face
i
am
quite
unaware
what
you
can
mean
said
mr
proctor
i
am
a
parson
but
i
never
made
any
threats
that
i
know
of
i
wish
to
see
miss
wodehouse
i
i
think
she
expects
me
at
this
hour
he
said
with
a
little
embarrassment
turning
to
john
who
for
his
part
had
been
standing
by
in
a
way
which
became
his
position
as
a
respectable
and
faithful
servant
waiting
any
opportunity
that
might
come
handy
to
show
his
disgust
for
the
new
yes
sir
said
john
promptly
and
with
emphasis
my
mistress
expects
you
sir
she
come
down
to
the
for
the
first
time
miss
lucy
keeps
her
room
sir
still
she
dreadfully
cut
up
poor
dear
young
lady
my
mistress
will
be
glad
to
see
you
sir
said
john
this
repetition
of
a
title
which
miss
wodehouse
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
receiving
was
intended
for
the
special
advantage
of
the
new
master
whom
john
had
no
intention
of
recognising
in
that
capacity
if
you
should
know
of
any
one
sir
as
is
in
want
of
a
steady
servant
the
man
continued
as
he
led
the
way
into
the
house
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
mr
proctor
whose
intentions
were
legible
enough
to
john
experienced
eyes
not
as
i
afeared
of
getting
suited
being
well
known
in
carlingford
but
it
would
come
natural
to
be
with
a
friend
of
the
family
there
aint
a
servant
in
the
house
sir
as
will
stay
when
the
ladies
go
and
i
think
as
miss
wodehouse
would
speak
for
me
said
john
with
natural
astuteness
this
address
made
mr
proctor
a
little
uneasy
it
recalled
to
him
the
unpleasant
side
of
the
important
transaction
in
which
he
was
about
to
engage
he
was
not
rich
and
did
not
see
his
way
now
to
any
near
prospect
of
requiring
the
services
of
a
steady
servant
and
the
thought
made
him
sigh
we
see
he
said
with
a
troubled
look
to
persevere
honourably
in
his
intentions
was
one
thing
but
to
be
insensible
to
the
loss
of
much
he
had
looked
forward
to
was
quite
another
it
was
accordingly
with
a
grave
and
somewhat
disturbed
expression
that
he
went
to
the
interview
which
was
to
decide
his
fate
miss
wodehouse
was
seated
in
the
looking
slightly
flushed
and
excited
though
she
knew
it
was
very
wrong
to
be
thus
roused
into
a
new
interest
the
day
after
her
father
funeral
the
events
altogether
had
been
of
so
startling
a
description
that
the
usual
decorum
of
an
afflicted
household
had
already
been
ruthlessly
broken
and
on
the
whole
notwithstanding
her
watching
and
grief
mr
proctor
thought
he
had
never
seen
the
object
of
his
affections
looking
so
well
as
she
did
now
in
the
long
black
dress
which
suited
her
better
than
the
faint
dove
colours
in
which
she
arrayed
herself
by
preference
she
was
not
it
is
true
quite
sure
what
mr
proctor
wanted
in
this
interview
he
had
solicited
but
a
certain
feminine
instinct
instructed
her
in
its
probable
eventualities
so
she
sat
in
a
subdued
flutter
with
a
little
colour
fluctuating
on
her
cheek
a
tear
in
her
eyes
and
some
wonder
and
expectation
in
her
heart
perhaps
in
her
youth
miss
wodehouse
might
have
come
to
such
a
feminine
crisis
before
but
if
so
it
was
long
ago
and
the
gentle
woman
had
never
been
given
to
matrimonial
speculations
and
was
as
fresh
and
inexperienced
as
any
girl
the
black
frame
in
which
she
was
set
made
her
soft
colour
look
fresher
and
less
faded
her
plaintive
voice
the
general
softness
of
her
demeanour
looked
harmonious
and
suitable
to
her
circumstances
mr
proctor
who
had
by
no
means
fallen
in
love
with
her
on
account
of
any
remnants
of
beauty
she
might
possess
had
never
admired
her
so
much
as
he
did
now
he
felt
confused
good
man
as
he
stood
before
her
and
seeing
her
so
much
younger
and
fairer
than
his
former
idea
began
to
grow
alarmed
and
wonder
at
his
serenity
what
if
she
thought
him
an
old
fogey
what
if
she
refused
him
this
supposition
brought
a
crimson
colour
to
mr
proctor
countenance
and
was
far
from
restoring
his
courage
it
was
a
wonderful
relief
to
him
when
she
with
the
instinct
of
a
timid
woman
rushed
into
hasty
talk
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
come
yesterday
she
said
lucy
and
i
were
very
grateful
we
have
not
many
relatives
and
my
dear
father
yes
said
the
late
rector
again
embarrassed
by
the
tears
which
choked
her
voice
he
was
very
much
respected
that
must
be
a
consolation
to
you
and
he
had
a
long
life
and
and
i
suppose
on
the
whole
a
happy
one
said
mr
proctor
with
you
and
your
sister
oh
mr
proctor
he
had
a
great
deal
to
put
up
with
said
miss
wentworth
through
her
tears
she
had
like
most
simple
people
an
instinctive
disinclination
to
admit
that
anybody
was
or
had
been
happy
it
looked
like
an
admission
of
inferiority
mamma
death
and
poor
tom
said
the
elder
sister
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
she
almost
forgot
her
own
little
feminine
flutter
of
expectancy
in
respect
to
mr
proctor
himself
perhaps
it
was
not
going
to
happen
this
time
and
as
she
was
pretty
well
assured
that
it
would
happen
one
day
or
another
she
was
not
anxious
about
it
if
i
only
knew
what
to
do
about
tom
she
continued
with
a
vague
appeal
in
her
voice
mr
proctor
got
up
from
his
chair
and
walked
to
the
window
when
he
had
looked
out
he
came
back
rather
surprising
miss
wodehouse
by
his
movements
i
wanted
very
much
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
you
he
said
growing
again
very
red
i
daresay
you
will
be
surprised
but
i
have
accepted
another
living
miss
wodehouse
and
here
the
good
man
stopped
short
in
a
terrible
state
of
embarrassment
not
knowing
what
next
to
say
yes
said
miss
wodehouse
interrogatively
her
heart
began
to
beat
quicker
but
perhaps
he
was
only
going
to
tell
her
about
the
new
work
he
had
undertaken
and
then
she
was
a
woman
and
had
some
knowledge
which
came
by
nature
how
to
conduct
herself
on
an
occasion
such
as
this
i
do
know
whether
you
recollect
said
mr
proctor
i
shall
never
forget
it
one
time
when
we
all
met
in
a
house
where
a
woman
was
dying
i
mean
your
sister
and
young
wentworth
and
you
and
i
and
neither
you
nor
i
knew
anything
about
it
said
the
late
rector
in
a
strange
voice
it
was
not
a
complimentary
way
of
opening
his
subject
and
the
occurrence
had
not
made
so
strong
an
impression
upon
miss
wodehouse
as
upon
her
companion
she
looked
a
little
puzzled
and
as
he
made
a
pause
gave
only
a
murmur
of
something
like
assent
and
waited
to
hear
what
more
he
might
have
to
say
we
neither
of
us
knew
anything
about
it
said
mr
proctor
neither
you
how
to
manage
her
nor
i
what
to
say
to
her
though
the
young
people
did
i
have
always
thought
of
you
from
that
time
i
have
thought
i
should
like
to
try
whether
i
was
good
for
anything
now
if
you
would
help
me
said
the
lover
when
he
had
said
this
he
walked
to
the
window
and
once
more
looked
out
and
came
back
redder
than
ever
you
see
we
are
neither
of
us
young
said
mr
proctor
and
he
stood
by
the
table
turning
over
the
books
nervously
without
looking
at
her
which
was
certainly
an
odd
commencement
for
a
wooing
that
is
quite
true
said
miss
wodehouse
rather
primly
she
had
never
disputed
that
fact
by
word
or
deed
but
still
it
was
not
pleasant
to
have
the
statement
thus
thrust
upon
her
without
any
apparent
provocation
it
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
which
a
woman
expects
to
have
said
to
her
under
such
circumstances
i
am
sure
i
hope
you
will
do
better
i
mean
be
more
comfortable
this
time
she
continued
after
a
pause
sitting
very
erect
on
her
seat
if
you
will
help
me
said
mr
proctor
taking
up
one
of
the
books
and
reading
the
name
on
it
which
was
lucky
for
him
for
it
was
miss
wodehouse
name
which
he
either
had
forgotten
or
never
had
known
and
here
they
came
to
a
dead
stop
what
was
she
to
say
she
was
a
little
affronted
to
tell
the
truth
that
he
should
remember
more
distinctly
than
anything
else
her
age
and
her
unlucky
failure
on
that
one
occasion
you
have
just
said
that
i
could
not
manage
said
the
mild
woman
not
without
a
little
vigour
of
her
own
and
how
then
could
i
help
you
mr
proctor
lucy
knows
a
great
deal
more
about
parish
work
than
i
do
she
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
and
for
one
half
of
a
second
there
arose
in
the
mind
of
the
elder
sister
a
kind
of
wistful
half
envy
of
lucy
who
young
and
knew
how
to
manage
a
feeling
which
died
in
unspeakable
remorse
and
compunction
as
soon
as
it
had
birth
but
lucy
would
not
have
me
said
the
late
rector
and
indeed
i
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
her
if
she
would
have
me
but
you
it
is
a
small
parish
but
it
not
a
bad
living
i
should
do
all
i
could
to
make
you
comfortable
at
least
we
might
try
said
mr
proctor
in
his
most
insinuating
tone
do
you
think
we
might
try
at
least
it
would
do
he
was
going
to
say
no
harm
but
on
second
thoughts
rejected
that
expression
at
least
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
said
the
excellent
man
with
renewed
confusion
it
a
nice
little
rectory
with
a
pretty
garden
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
and
perhaps
it
might
help
you
to
settle
about
going
away
and
and
i
daresay
there
would
be
room
for
lucy
do
you
think
you
would
try
cried
mr
proctor
volunteering
in
spite
of
himself
the
very
hospitality
which
he
had
thought
it
hard
might
be
required
of
him
but
somehow
his
suit
seemed
to
want
backing
at
the
actual
moment
when
it
was
being
made
as
for
miss
wodehouse
she
sat
and
listened
to
him
till
he
began
to
falter
and
then
her
composure
gave
way
all
at
once
but
as
for
trying
she
gasped
in
broken
mouthfuls
of
speech
that
would
never
never
do
mr
proctor
it
has
to
be
done
done
for
good
and
all
if
if
it
is
done
at
all
sobbed
the
poor
lady
whose
voice
came
somewhat
muffled
through
her
handkerchief
and
her
tears
then
it
shall
be
for
good
and
all
cried
mr
proctor
with
a
sudden
impulse
of
energy
this
was
how
it
came
about
that
miss
wodehouse
and
the
late
rector
were
engaged
he
had
an
idea
that
he
might
be
expected
to
kiss
her
and
certainly
ought
to
call
her
mary
after
this
and
hovered
for
another
minute
near
her
seat
not
at
all
disinclined
for
the
former
operation
but
his
courage
failed
him
and
he
only
drew
a
chair
a
little
closer
and
sat
down
hoping
she
would
soon
stop
crying
and
indeed
by
the
time
that
he
produced
out
of
his
the
little
photograph
of
the
new
rectory
which
he
had
had
made
for
her
by
a
rural
artist
miss
wodehouse
had
emerged
out
of
her
handkerchief
and
was
perhaps
in
her
heart
as
happy
in
a
quiet
way
as
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
she
who
had
never
been
good
for
much
was
now
in
the
time
of
their
need
endowed
with
a
home
which
she
could
offer
lucy
it
was
she
the
helpless
one
of
the
family
who
was
to
be
her
young
sister
deliverer
let
it
be
forgiven
to
her
if
in
the
tumult
of
the
moment
this
was
the
thought
that
came
first
when
miss
wodehouse
went
after
this
agitating
but
satisfactory
interview
she
found
lucy
engaged
in
putting
together
some
books
and
personal
trifles
of
her
own
which
were
scattered
about
the
little
she
had
been
reading
memoriam
until
it
vexed
her
to
feel
how
inevitably
good
sense
came
in
and
interfered
with
the
enthusiasm
of
her
grief
making
her
sensible
that
to
apply
to
her
fond
old
father
all
the
lofty
lauds
which
were
appropriate
to
the
poet
hero
would
be
folly
indeed
he
had
been
a
good
tender
father
to
her
but
he
was
not
the
sweetest
soul
that
ever
looked
with
human
eyes
and
lucy
could
not
but
stop
in
her
reading
with
a
kind
of
pang
and
as
this
consciousness
came
upon
her
miss
wodehouse
looked
rather
aghast
when
she
found
her
sister
thus
occupied
did
you
think
of
accepting
miss
wentworth
invitation
after
all
said
miss
wodehouse
but
dear
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
awkward
and
oh
lucy
my
darling
i
have
so
many
things
to
tell
you
said
the
anxious
sister
who
was
shy
of
communicating
her
own
particular
news
before
many
minutes
had
passed
lucy
had
thrown
aside
all
the
books
and
was
sitting
by
her
sister
side
in
disconcerted
amazement
to
hear
her
story
only
for
lucy
like
most
other
girls
of
her
age
thought
love
and
marriage
were
things
which
belonged
only
to
her
own
level
of
existence
and
was
a
little
vexed
and
disappointed
to
find
that
her
elder
sister
could
condescend
to
such
youthful
matters
on
the
whole
she
rather
blushed
for
mary
and
felt
sadly
as
if
she
had
come
down
from
an
imaginary
pedestal
and
then
mr
proctor
so
old
and
so
ordinary
whom
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
as
a
bridegroom
and
still
less
as
a
brother
i
shall
get
used
to
it
presently
said
lucy
with
a
burning
flush
on
her
cheek
and
a
half
feeling
that
she
had
reason
to
be
ashamed
but
it
is
so
strange
to
think
of
you
in
that
way
mary
i
always
thought
you
were
too
too
sensible
for
that
sort
of
thing
which
was
a
reproach
that
went
to
miss
wodehouse
heart
oh
lucy
dear
said
that
mild
woman
who
in
this
view
of
the
matter
became
as
much
ashamed
of
herself
as
lucy
could
desire
what
could
i
do
i
know
what
you
mean
at
my
time
of
life
but
i
could
not
let
you
be
dependent
on
tom
my
darling
said
miss
wodehouse
with
a
deprecating
appealing
look
no
indeed
said
lucy
that
would
be
impossible
under
any
circumstances
nor
on
you
either
mary
dear
i
can
do
something
to
make
a
living
and
i
should
like
it
i
have
always
been
fond
of
work
i
will
not
permit
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
me
said
the
younger
sister
with
some
dignity
i
see
how
it
has
been
i
felt
sure
it
was
not
of
your
own
accord
miss
wodehouse
wrung
her
hands
with
dismay
and
perplexity
what
was
she
to
do
if
lucy
stood
out
and
refused
her
consent
she
could
not
humble
herself
so
far
as
to
confess
that
she
rather
liked
mr
proctor
and
was
on
the
whole
not
displeased
to
be
married
for
the
feeling
that
lucy
expected
her
to
be
too
sensible
for
that
sort
of
thing
overawed
the
poor
lady
but
lucy
i
have
given
him
my
promise
said
poor
miss
wodehouse
it
it
would
make
him
very
unhappy
i
ca
use
him
badly
lucy
dear
i
will
speak
to
him
and
explain
if
it
is
necessary
whatever
happens
i
ca
let
you
sacrifice
yourself
for
me
said
lucy
all
the
answer
miss
wodehouse
could
make
was
expressed
in
the
tears
of
vexation
and
mortification
which
rushed
to
her
eyes
she
repelled
her
young
sister
ministrations
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
with
hasty
impatience
her
troubles
had
not
been
few
for
the
last
hours
she
had
been
questioned
about
tom
till
she
had
altogether
lost
her
head
and
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
saying
and
lucy
had
not
applauded
that
notable
expedient
of
throwing
the
shame
of
the
family
upon
mr
wentworth
to
be
concealed
and
taken
care
of
which
had
brought
so
many
vexations
to
the
perpetual
curate
miss
wodehouse
at
last
was
driven
to
bay
she
had
done
all
for
the
best
but
nobody
gave
her
any
credit
for
it
and
now
this
last
step
by
which
she
had
meant
to
provide
a
home
for
lucy
was
about
to
be
contradicted
and
put
a
stop
to
altogether
she
put
away
lucy
arm
and
rejected
her
consolations
what
is
the
use
of
pretending
to
be
fond
of
me
if
i
am
always
to
be
wrong
and
never
to
have
my
my
own
way
in
anything
cried
the
poor
lady
who
beginning
with
steadiness
broke
down
before
she
reached
the
end
of
her
little
speech
the
words
made
lucy
open
her
blue
eyes
with
wonder
and
after
that
there
followed
a
fuller
explanation
which
greatly
changed
the
ideas
of
the
younger
sister
after
her
consent
had
been
at
last
extracted
from
her
and
when
miss
wodehouse
regained
her
composure
she
reported
to
lucy
the
greater
part
of
the
conversation
which
had
taken
place
in
the
of
which
mr
proctor
proposal
constituted
only
a
part
and
which
touched
upon
matters
still
more
interesting
to
her
hearer
the
two
sisters
preoccupied
by
their
father
illness
and
death
had
up
to
this
time
but
a
vague
knowledge
of
the
difficulties
which
surrounded
the
perpetual
curate
his
trial
which
mr
proctor
had
reported
to
his
had
been
unsuspected
by
either
of
them
and
they
were
not
even
aware
of
the
event
which
had
given
rise
to
it
the
disappearance
of
rosa
elsworthy
miss
wodehouse
told
the
story
with
faltering
lips
not
being
able
to
divest
herself
of
the
idea
that
having
been
publicly
accused
mr
wentworth
must
be
more
or
less
guilty
while
at
the
same
time
a
sense
that
her
brother
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
and
a
great
reluctance
to
name
his
name
complicated
the
narrative
she
had
already
got
into
trouble
with
lucy
about
this
unlucky
brother
and
unconsciously
in
her
story
she
took
an
air
of
defence
i
should
have
thought
better
of
mr
wentworth
if
he
had
not
tried
to
throw
the
guilt
on
another
said
the
perplexed
woman
oh
lucy
dear
between
two
people
it
is
so
hard
to
know
what
to
do
i
know
what
i
shall
do
said
lucy
promptly
but
she
would
not
further
explain
herself
she
was
however
quite
roused
up
out
of
memoriam
she
went
to
her
desk
and
drew
out
some
of
the
paper
deeply
edged
with
black
which
announced
before
words
its
tale
of
grief
to
all
her
correspondents
it
was
with
some
alarm
that
miss
wodehouse
awaited
this
letter
which
was
placed
before
her
as
soon
as
finished
this
was
what
as
soon
as
she
knew
the
story
lucy
prompt
and
generous
spirit
said
dear
mr
wentworth
we
have
just
heard
of
the
vexations
you
have
been
suffering
to
our
great
indignation
and
distress
some
people
may
think
it
is
a
matter
with
which
i
have
no
business
to
interfere
but
i
can
not
have
you
think
for
a
moment
that
we
to
whom
you
have
been
so
kind
could
put
the
slightest
faith
in
any
such
accusations
against
you
we
are
not
of
much
consequence
but
we
are
two
women
to
whom
any
such
evil
would
be
a
horror
if
it
is
any
one
connected
with
us
who
has
brought
you
into
this
painful
position
it
gives
us
the
more
reason
to
be
indignant
and
angry
i
know
now
what
you
meant
about
the
will
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
i
should
do
just
the
same
but
for
all
that
i
understand
now
what
you
meant
i
understand
also
how
much
we
owe
to
you
of
which
up
to
yesterday
i
was
totally
unaware
you
ought
never
to
have
been
asked
to
take
our
burden
upon
your
shoulders
i
suppose
you
ought
not
to
have
done
it
but
all
the
same
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
i
do
suppose
we
ever
can
do
anything
for
you
to
show
our
gratitude
and
indeed
i
do
not
believe
in
paying
back
but
in
the
mean
time
thank
you
and
do
from
any
consideration
for
us
suffer
a
stain
which
belongs
to
another
to
rest
upon
yourself
you
are
a
clergyman
and
your
reputation
must
be
clear
pardon
me
for
saying
so
as
if
i
were
qualified
to
advise
you
but
it
would
be
terrible
to
think
that
you
were
suffering
such
an
injury
out
of
consideration
for
gratefully
and
truly
yours
lucy
wodehouse
the
conclusion
of
this
letter
gave
lucy
a
good
deal
of
trouble
her
honest
heart
was
so
moved
with
gratitude
and
admiration
that
she
had
nearly
called
herself
affectionately
mr
wentworth
why
should
not
she
he
has
acted
like
a
brother
to
us
lucy
said
to
herself
and
then
she
paused
to
inquire
whether
his
conduct
had
indeed
arisen
from
brotherly
motives
solely
then
when
she
had
begun
to
write
faithfully
instead
a
further
difficulty
occurred
to
her
not
thus
lightly
and
unsolicited
could
she
call
herself
faithful
for
did
not
the
word
mean
everything
that
words
could
convey
in
any
human
relationship
when
she
had
concluded
it
at
last
and
satisfied
her
scruples
by
the
formula
above
she
laid
the
letter
before
her
sister
this
event
terminated
the
active
operations
of
the
day
in
the
dwelling
of
the
wodehouses
their
brother
had
not
asked
to
see
them
had
not
interrupted
them
as
yet
in
their
retreat
where
they
were
sedulously
waited
upon
by
the
entire
household
when
miss
agitation
was
over
she
too
began
to
collect
together
her
books
and
personalities
and
they
ended
by
a
long
consultation
where
they
were
to
go
and
what
they
were
to
do
during
the
course
of
which
the
elder
sister
exhibited
with
a
certain
shy
pride
that
little
photograph
of
the
new
rectory
in
which
there
was
one
window
embowered
in
foliage
which
the
bride
had
already
concluded
was
to
be
lucy
room
lucy
yielded
during
this
sisterly
conference
to
sympathetic
thoughts
even
of
mr
proctor
the
two
women
were
alone
in
the
world
they
were
still
so
near
the
grave
and
the
deathbed
that
chance
words
spoken
without
thought
from
time
to
time
awakened
in
both
the
ready
tears
now
and
then
they
each
paused
to
consider
with
a
sob
what
would
have
liked
best
they
knew
very
little
of
what
was
going
on
outside
at
the
moment
when
they
were
occupied
with
those
simple

chapter
xxxviii
while
matters
were
thus
arranging
themselves
in
the
ideas
at
least
of
the
two
sisters
whose
prospects
had
been
so
suddenly
changed
explanations
of
a
very
varied
kind
were
going
on
in
the
house
of
the
miss
wentworths
it
was
a
very
full
house
by
this
time
having
been
invaded
and
taken
possession
of
by
the
family
in
a
way
which
entirely
obliterated
the
calmer
interests
and
occupations
of
the
habitual
inhabitants
the
three
ladies
had
reached
the
stage
of
life
which
knows
no
personal
events
except
those
of
illness
and
death
and
the
presence
of
jack
wentworth
of
frank
and
gerald
and
even
of
louisa
reduced
them
altogether
to
the
rank
of
spectators
the
audience
or
at
the
utmost
the
chorus
of
the
drama
though
this
was
scarcely
the
case
with
miss
dora
who
kept
her
own
room
where
she
lay
on
the
sofa
and
received
visits
and
told
the
story
of
her
extraordinary
adventure
the
only
adventure
of
her
life
the
interest
of
the
household
centred
chiefly
however
in
the
which
as
being
the
least
habitable
apartment
in
the
house
was
considered
to
be
most
adapted
for
anything
in
the
shape
of
business
on
the
way
from
the
church
to
miss
wentworth
house
the
curate
had
given
his
father
a
brief
account
of
all
the
events
which
had
led
to
his
present
position
but
though
much
eased
in
his
mind
and
partly
satisfied
the
squire
was
not
yet
clear
how
it
all
came
about
his
countenance
was
far
from
having
regained
that
composure
which
indeed
the
recent
course
of
events
in
the
family
had
pretty
nearly
driven
out
of
his
life
his
fresh
morning
dress
with
all
its
little
niceties
and
the
fresh
colour
which
even
anxiety
could
not
drive
away
from
his
cheeks
were
somehow
contradicted
in
their
sentiment
of
cheerfulness
by
the
puckers
in
his
forehead
and
the
harassed
look
of
his
face
he
sat
down
in
the
big
leathern
chair
by
the
fireplace
and
looked
round
him
with
a
sigh
and
the
air
of
a
man
who
wonders
what
will
be
the
next
vexation
i
like
to
hear
it
over
again
frank
said
the
squire
my
mind
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
i
do
say
i
ever
was
clever
like
you
young
fellows
but
i
used
to
understand
what
was
said
to
me
now
i
seem
to
require
to
hear
everything
twice
over
perhaps
it
is
because
i
have
had
myself
to
say
the
same
things
over
again
a
great
many
times
lately
he
added
with
a
sigh
of
weariness
most
likely
his
eye
fell
on
gerald
as
he
said
so
at
all
events
the
rector
of
wentworth
moved
sadly
from
where
he
was
standing
and
went
to
the
window
where
he
was
out
of
his
father
range
of
vision
gerald
looks
his
movements
every
action
of
his
seemed
somehow
to
bear
a
symbolic
meaning
at
this
crisis
in
his
life
he
was
no
longer
in
any
doubt
he
had
made
up
his
mind
he
looked
like
a
martyr
walking
to
his
execution
as
he
crossed
the
room
and
the
squire
looked
after
him
and
once
more
breathed
out
of
his
impatient
breast
a
heavy
short
sigh
louisa
who
had
placed
herself
in
the
other
great
chair
at
the
other
side
of
the
forlorn
fireplace
from
which
this
summer
afternoon
there
came
no
cheerful
light
put
up
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
began
to
cry
with
sobs
which
circumstances
surrounding
him
were
far
from
being
encouraging
to
frank
as
he
entered
anew
into
his
own
story
a
story
which
he
told
with
many
interruptions
the
squire
who
had
once
sworn
by
frank
had
now
a
terrible
shadow
of
distrust
in
his
mind
jack
was
here
on
the
spot
of
whom
the
unfortunate
father
knew
more
harm
than
he
had
ever
told
and
the
secret
dread
that
he
had
somehow
corrupted
his
younger
brother
came
like
a
cold
shadow
over
mr
wentworth
mind
he
could
not
slur
over
any
part
of
the
narrative
but
his
son
to
the
extent
of
his
ability
with
an
anxious
inquisition
into
all
the
particulars
he
was
too
deeply
concerned
to
take
anything
for
granted
he
sat
up
in
his
chair
with
those
puckers
in
his
forehead
with
that
harassed
look
in
his
eyes
making
an
anxious
vigilant
suspicious
investigation
which
was
pathetic
to
behold
if
the
defendant
who
was
thus
being
examined
on
his
honour
had
been
guilty
the
heart
of
the
judge
would
have
broken
but
that
was
all
the
more
reason
for
searching
into
it
with
jealous
particularity
and
with
a
suspicion
which
kept
always
gleaming
out
of
his
troubled
eyes
in
sudden
anxious
glances
saying
you
are
guilty
are
you
guilty
with
mingled
accusations
and
appeals
the
accused
being
innocent
felt
this
suspicion
more
hard
to
bear
than
if
he
had
been
a
hundred
times
guilty
i
understand
a
little
about
this
fellow
wodehouse
said
the
squire
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
you
took
him
in
what
did
you
take
him
in
for
sir
at
first
perhaps
i
could
understand
the
rest
if
you
would
satisfy
me
of
that
i
took
him
in
said
the
curate
rather
slowly
because
his
sister
asked
me
she
threw
him
upon
my
charity
she
told
me
the
danger
he
was
in
what
danger
was
he
in
asked
the
squire
the
curate
made
a
pause
and
as
he
paused
mr
wentworth
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
with
another
pucker
in
his
forehead
and
a
still
sharper
gleam
of
suspicion
in
his
eyes
his
father
had
been
offended
time
after
time
in
the
most
serious
way
this
time
he
had
threatened
to
give
him
up
to
justice
i
ca
tell
you
what
he
had
done
because
it
would
be
breaking
my
trust
but
he
had
made
himself
obnoxious
to
the
law
said
frank
wentworth
to
save
him
from
the
chance
of
being
arrested
his
sister
brought
him
to
me
the
squire
hand
shook
a
good
deal
as
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
forehead
perhaps
it
would
be
the
best
way
if
one
had
not
too
much
regard
for
the
honour
of
the
family
he
said
tremulously
like
a
man
under
a
sudden
temptation
but
the
sister
sir
why
did
she
bring
him
to
you
he
added
immediately
after
with
renewed
energy
mr
wentworth
was
not
aware
that
while
he
was
speaking
his
eldest
son
had
come
into
the
room
he
had
his
back
to
the
door
and
he
did
not
see
jack
who
stood
rather
doubtfully
on
the
threshold
with
a
certain
shade
of
embarrassment
upon
his
ordinary
composure
it
is
not
everybody
that
a
woman
would
confide
her
brother
life
to
said
the
squire
who
is
the
sister
is
she
is
there
any
any
entanglement
that
i
do
know
of
it
will
be
better
for
all
of
us
if
you
tell
me
plainly
said
the
old
man
with
a
querulous
sound
in
his
voice
he
forgot
the
relationship
of
his
own
girls
to
jack
and
groaned
within
himself
at
what
appeared
almost
certain
evidence
that
the
sister
of
a
criminal
like
wodehouse
had
got
possession
of
frank
miss
wodehouse
is
about
the
same
age
as
my
aunt
dora
said
the
curate
it
was
an
exaggeration
which
would
have
gone
to
the
poor
lady
heart
but
frank
wentworth
in
the
unconscious
insolence
of
his
youth
was
quite
unaware
and
careless
of
the
difference
then
he
paused
for
a
moment
with
an
involuntary
smile
but
i
am
a
clergyman
sir
he
continued
seriously
if
a
man
in
my
position
is
good
for
anything
it
is
his
business
to
help
the
helpless
i
could
do
no
good
in
any
other
way
i
took
him
into
my
house
frank
said
the
squire
i
beg
your
pardon
i
believe
in
my
heart
you
true
and
honest
if
i
were
not
driven
out
of
my
senses
by
one
thing
and
another
said
mr
wentworth
with
bitterness
they
make
me
unjust
to
you
sir
unjust
to
you
but
never
mind
go
on
why
you
tell
these
fellows
what
you
told
me
that
would
have
settled
the
business
at
once
without
any
more
ado
mr
morgan
is
a
great
deal
too
much
prejudiced
against
me
to
believe
anything
i
said
i
thought
it
better
to
let
him
prove
to
himself
his
own
injustice
and
another
still
more
powerful
reason
said
the
curate
stop
sir
stop
i
ca
follow
you
to
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
why
is
mr
morgan
prejudiced
against
you
said
the
squire
once
more
sitting
upright
and
recommencing
his
examination
frank
wentworth
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
though
he
was
far
from
being
amused
i
know
no
reason
except
that
i
have
worked
in
his
parish
without
his
permission
he
answered
briefly
enough
for
which
he
threatened
to
have
me
up
before
somebody
or
other
dr
lushington
i
suppose
who
is
the
new
council
of
trent
and
settles
all
our
matters
for
us
nowadays
said
the
curate
not
without
a
little
natural
scorn
at
which
however
his
father
groaned
there
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
dr
lushington
said
the
squire
he
gives
you
justice
at
all
events
which
you
parsons
never
give
each
other
you
know
you
ought
not
to
have
worked
in
the
rector
parish
sir
without
his
permission
it
like
shooting
in
another
grounds
however
that
not
my
business
and
the
other
reason
sir
said
mr
wentworth
with
his
anxious
look
my
dear
father
said
the
curate
touched
by
the
anxiety
in
the
squire
face
and
sitting
down
by
him
with
a
sudden
impulse
i
have
done
nothing
which
either
you
or
i
need
be
ashamed
of
i
am
grieved
that
you
should
think
it
necessary
to
examine
me
so
closely
wodehouse
is
a
rascal
but
i
had
taken
charge
of
him
and
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
shield
him
i
felt
bound
to
do
so
i
made
an
appeal
to
his
honour
if
he
had
any
and
to
his
fears
which
are
more
to
be
depended
on
and
gave
him
until
noon
to
consider
it
here
is
his
note
which
was
given
me
in
the
vestry
and
now
you
know
the
whole
business
and
how
it
is
that
i
postponed
the
conclusion
till
the
squire
put
on
his
spectacles
with
a
tremulous
hand
to
read
the
note
which
his
son
gave
him
the
room
was
very
still
while
he
read
it
no
sound
interrupting
him
except
an
occasional
sniff
from
louisa
who
was
in
a
permanent
state
of
whimpering
and
besides
had
ceased
to
be
interested
in
frank
affairs
jack
wentworth
standing
in
the
background
behind
the
squire
chair
had
the
whole
party
before
him
and
studied
them
keenly
with
thoughts
which
nobody
guessed
at
gerald
was
still
standing
by
the
window
leaning
on
it
with
his
face
only
half
turned
to
the
others
was
he
thinking
of
the
others
was
he
still
one
of
them
or
was
he
saying
his
office
from
some
invisible
breviary
abstracted
into
another
life
that
supposition
looked
the
most
like
truth
near
him
was
his
wife
who
had
thrown
herself
a
heap
of
bright
fluttering
muslin
into
the
great
chair
and
kept
her
handkerchief
to
her
red
eyes
she
had
enough
troubles
of
her
own
to
occupy
her
poor
soul
just
at
that
moment
it
occurred
to
her
to
think
of
the
laburnum
berries
in
the
shrubbery
at
the
rectory
which
it
was
suddenly
borne
in
upon
her
would
prove
fatal
to
one
or
other
of
the
children
in
her
absence
the
dear
rectory
which
she
had
to
leave
so
soon
and
frank
will
have
it
of
course
louisa
said
to
herself
and
marry
somebody
and
then
she
thought
of
the
laburnum
berries
in
connection
with
his
problematical
children
not
without
a
movement
of
satisfaction
opposite
to
her
was
the
squire
holding
wodehouse
epistle
in
a
hand
which
shook
a
little
and
reading
aloud
slowly
as
he
could
make
it
out
the
note
was
short
and
insolent
enough
while
it
was
being
read
jack
wentworth
who
was
not
easily
discomposed
grew
red
and
restless
he
had
not
dictated
it
certainly
nor
even
suggested
the
wording
of
the
epistle
but
it
was
he
who
half
in
scorn
and
half
in
pity
of
the
vagabond
terrors
had
reassured
wodehouse
and
convinced
him
that
it
was
only
the
punishments
of
public
opinion
which
the
curate
could
bring
upon
him
hardened
as
jack
was
he
could
not
but
be
conscious
that
thus
to
stand
in
his
brother
way
was
a
shabby
business
enough
and
to
feel
that
he
himself
and
his
protégé
cut
a
very
poor
figure
in
presence
of
the
manful
old
squire
with
all
his
burdens
and
of
frank
who
had
after
all
nothing
to
explain
which
was
not
to
his
honour
notwithstanding
that
he
was
at
the
present
moment
his
brother
adversary
actually
working
against
him
and
prolonging
his
difficulties
an
odd
kind
of
contempt
and
indignation
against
the
fools
who
could
doubt
frank
honour
possessed
the
prodigal
at
the
moment
a
parcel
of
asses
he
said
to
himself
and
so
stood
and
listened
to
wodehouse
little
note
of
defiance
which
but
for
his
prompting
the
sullen
vagabond
would
never
have
dared
to
send
to
his
former
protector
the
letter
itself
was
as
follows
i
have
consulted
my
friends
about
what
you
said
and
they
tell
me
it
is
d
d
nonsense
you
ca
do
me
any
harm
and
i
do
mean
to
get
myself
into
any
scrape
for
you
you
can
do
what
you
like
i
sha
take
any
notice
your
love
affairs
are
no
business
of
yours
truly
wodehouse
mr
wentworth
threw
the
miserable
scrawl
on
the
table
the
fellow
is
a
scoundrel
said
the
squire
he
does
not
seem
to
have
a
spark
of
gratitude
you
done
a
deal
too
much
for
him
already
and
if
the
sister
is
as
old
as
dora
he
continued
after
a
long
pause
with
a
relaxation
of
his
features
he
was
too
much
worn
out
to
smile
yes
said
the
curate
the
young
man
was
sensible
of
a
sudden
flush
and
heat
but
did
not
feel
any
inclination
to
smile
matters
were
very
serious
just
then
with
frank
wentworth
he
was
about
to
shake
himself
free
of
one
vexation
no
doubt
but
at
this
moment
when
lucy
wodehouse
was
homeless
and
helpless
he
had
nothing
to
offer
her
nor
any
prospects
even
which
he
dared
ask
her
to
share
with
him
this
was
no
time
to
speak
of
the
other
sister
who
was
not
as
old
as
miss
dora
he
was
more
than
ever
the
perpetual
curate
now
perhaps
being
a
clergyman
he
ought
not
to
have
been
swayed
by
such
merely
human
emotions
but
honour
and
pride
alike
demanded
that
he
should
remain
in
carlingford
and
he
had
no
shelter
to
offer
lucy
in
the
time
of
her
need
after
this
there
followed
a
pause
which
was
far
from
being
cheerful
frank
could
not
but
be
disconsolate
enough
over
his
prospects
when
the
excitement
died
away
and
there
was
another
big
terrible
event
looming
darkly
in
the
midst
of
the
family
which
they
had
not
courage
to
name
to
each
other
the
long
uneasy
pause
was
at
length
broken
by
louisa
whose
voice
sounded
in
the
unnatural
silence
like
the
burst
of
impatient
rain
which
precedes
a
thunderstorm
now
that
you
have
done
with
frank
affairs
if
you
have
done
with
them
said
louisa
perhaps
somebody
will
speak
to
gerald
i
mean
in
the
way
of
arguing
if
some
one
would
only
speak
to
him
you
all
know
as
well
as
i
do
how
many
children
we
got
and
and
an
other
coming
sobbed
the
poor
lady
if
something
does
happen
to
me
which
i
am
sure
is
more
than
likely
and
might
be
expected
i
do
blame
dear
grandpapa
for
he
has
said
everything
and
so
have
i
but
i
do
think
his
brothers
ought
to
take
a
little
more
interest
oh
frank
you
know
it
does
matter
for
you
you
are
a
young
man
you
can
go
anywhere
but
when
there
are
five
children
and
and
an
other
and
how
are
we
to
live
you
know
what
a
little
bit
of
money
i
had
when
gerald
married
me
everybody
knows
gerald
never
cared
for
money
if
i
had
had
a
good
fortune
it
would
have
been
quite
different
cried
poor
louisa
with
a
little
flow
of
tears
and
a
querulous
sob
as
though
that
too
was
gerald
fault
he
has
not
sent
off
his
letter
yet
frank
said
the
injured
wife
if
you
would
but
speak
to
him
he
does
not
mind
me
or
grandpapa
but
he
might
mind
you
tell
him
we
shall
have
nothing
to
live
on
tell
him
hush
said
gerald
he
came
forward
to
the
table
very
pale
and
patient
as
became
a
man
at
the
point
of
legal
death
i
sent
away
my
letter
by
this
time
i
am
no
longer
rector
of
wentworth
do
not
break
my
heart
do
you
think
there
is
any
particular
in
the
whole
matter
which
i
have
not
considered
the
children
yourself
everything
hush
there
is
nothing
now
to
be
said
the
squire
rose
almost
as
pale
as
his
son
from
his
chair
i
think
i
go
out
into
the
air
a
little
said
mr
wentworth
there
always
something
new
happening
here
is
a
son
of
my
own
said
the
old
man
rising
into
a
flush
of
energy
who
has
not
only
deserted
his
post
but
deserted
it
secretly
frank
god
bless
my
soul
do
speak
to
me
sir
i
tell
you
he
gone
over
to
the
enemy
as
much
as
charley
would
have
done
if
he
had
deserted
at
the
alma
and
done
it
when
nobody
knew
or
was
thinking
i
used
to
be
thought
a
man
of
honour
in
my
day
said
mr
wentworth
bitterly
and
it
a
mean
thing
to
say
it
came
by
their
mother
side
there
jack
the
eldest
son
roused
himself
up
at
the
mention
of
his
own
name
notwithstanding
all
his
faults
he
was
not
a
man
to
stand
behind
backs
and
listen
to
what
was
said
of
him
he
came
forward
with
his
usual
ease
though
a
close
observer
might
have
detected
a
flush
on
his
face
i
am
here
sir
said
the
heir
i
can
not
flatter
myself
you
will
have
much
pleasure
in
seeing
me
but
i
suppose
i
have
still
a
right
to
be
considered
one
of
the
family
the
squire
who
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
standing
leaning
against
the
table
when
jack
advanced
returned
to
his
chair
and
sat
down
as
his
eldest
son
confronted
him
they
had
not
met
for
years
and
the
shock
was
great
mr
wentworth
put
his
hand
to
his
cravat
and
pulled
at
it
with
an
instinctive
movement
the
old
man
was
still
feeble
from
his
late
illness
and
apprehensive
of
a
return
of
the
disease
of
the
wentworths
he
restrained
himself
however
with
force
so
passionate
that
jack
did
not
guess
at
the
meaning
of
the
gasp
which
before
the
squire
was
able
to
speak
to
him
convulsed
his
throat
and
made
frank
start
forward
to
offer
assistance
which
his
father
impatiently
rejected
the
squire
made
indeed
a
great
effort
to
speak
with
dignity
he
looked
from
one
to
another
of
his
tall
sons
as
he
propped
himself
up
by
the
arms
of
his
chair
you
are
the
most
important
member
of
the
family
said
mr
wentworth
it
is
long
since
you
have
been
among
us
but
that
is
not
our
fault
if
things
had
been
different
i
should
have
been
glad
of
your
advice
as
a
man
of
the
world
anyhow
i
ca
wish
you
to
be
estranged
from
your
brothers
said
the
squire
it
was
all
any
one
could
say
the
heir
of
wentworth
was
not
to
be
denounced
or
insulted
among
his
kindred
but
he
could
not
be
taken
to
their
bosom
perhaps
the
reception
thus
given
him
was
more
galling
than
any
other
could
have
been
to
jack
wentworth
pride
he
stood
at
the
table
by
himself
before
his
father
feeling
that
there
existed
no
living
relations
between
himself
and
any
one
present
he
had
keen
intellectual
perceptions
and
could
recognise
the
beauty
of
honour
and
worth
as
well
as
most
people
and
the
contrast
between
himself
and
the
others
who
surrounded
him
presented
itself
in
a
very
forcible
light
to
jack
instead
of
gerald
and
frank
wodehouse
was
allotted
companion
for
that
once
he
was
bitter
notwithstanding
his
habitual
yes
he
said
it
would
be
a
pity
to
estrange
me
from
my
brothers
we
are
on
the
whole
a
lucky
trio
i
whom
my
relations
are
civil
to
and
frank
who
is
not
acquitted
yet
though
he
seems
so
confident
and
gerald
who
has
made
the
greatest
mistake
of
all
jack
said
the
curate
nobody
wants
to
quarrel
with
you
dealt
shabbily
by
me
but
i
do
not
mind
only
talk
of
things
you
understand
do
talk
of
gerald
for
a
moment
jack
wentworth
was
roused
almost
to
passion
what
is
gerald
that
i
should
not
understand
him
said
jack
he
and
i
are
the
original
brood
you
are
all
a
set
of
interlopers
the
rest
of
you
what
is
gerald
that
i
should
not
talk
of
him
in
the
world
my
dear
frank
continued
the
heir
superciliously
as
the
squire
himself
will
testify
a
man
is
not
generally
exempted
from
criticism
because
he
is
a
parson
gerald
is
i
am
a
simple
catholic
layman
nothing
more
said
gerald
not
worth
criticism
having
done
nothing
i
am
aware
i
am
as
good
as
dead
there
is
no
reason
why
jack
should
not
talk
if
it
pleases
him
it
will
make
no
difference
to
me
and
yet
said
frank
it
is
only
the
other
day
that
you
told
us
you
were
nothing
if
not
a
priest
gerald
turned
upon
him
with
a
look
of
melancholy
reproach
that
went
to
the
curate
heart
it
is
true
i
said
so
he
replied
and
then
he
made
a
pause
and
the
light
died
out
of
his
pale
face
do
bring
up
the
ghosts
of
my
dead
battles
frank
i
said
so
only
the
other
day
but
it
is
the
glory
of
the
true
church
said
the
convert
with
a
sudden
glow
which
restored
colour
for
a
moment
to
his
face
to
restrain
and
subdue
the
last
enemy
the
will
of
man
i
am
content
to
be
nothing
as
the
saints
were
the
fight
has
been
hard
enough
but
i
am
not
ashamed
of
the
victory
when
the
law
of
the
church
and
the
obedience
of
the
saints
ordain
me
to
be
nothing
i
consent
to
it
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
and
this
is
how
it
is
to
be
cried
louisa
he
knows
what
is
coming
and
he
does
not
care
and
none
of
you
will
interfere
or
speak
to
him
it
is
not
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
would
happen
he
tells
you
himself
that
he
will
be
nothing
and
even
if
can
put
up
with
it
after
being
a
man
of
such
consideration
in
the
county
how
am
to
put
up
with
it
we
have
always
been
used
to
the
very
best
society
said
poor
louisa
with
tears
the
duke
himself
was
not
more
thought
of
and
now
he
tells
you
he
is
to
be
nothing
mrs
wentworth
stopped
to
dry
her
eyes
with
tremulous
haste
may
not
mind
said
louisa
for
at
least
he
is
having
his
own
way
it
is
all
very
well
for
a
man
who
can
do
as
he
pleases
but
it
is
his
poor
wife
who
will
have
to
suffer
i
do
know
who
will
visit
me
after
it
all
over
and
people
will
give
over
asking
us
if
we
do
ask
them
again
and
how
can
we
ever
have
anybody
with
five
children
or
more
and
only
a
few
hundreds
oh
frank
it
kills
me
to
think
of
it
do
you
think
you
might
speak
to
him
again
she
whispered
stretching
up
to
his
ear
when
gerald
with
a
sigh
had
gone
back
to
his
window
the
squire
too
cast
an
appealing
glance
at
his
younger
son
it
is
all
true
enough
that
she
says
said
mr
wentworth
she
understand
frank
but
she
right
enough
in
what
she
saying
if
things
were
different
between
your
brother
and
me
i
ask
his
advice
said
the
squire
with
a
sigh
he
gave
a
longing
look
at
his
eldest
son
who
stood
with
his
usual
ease
before
the
fireplace
matters
had
gone
a
great
deal
too
far
between
the
father
and
son
to
admit
of
the
usual
displeasure
of
an
aggrieved
parent
all
that
was
over
long
ago
and
mr
wentworth
could
not
restrain
a
certain
melting
of
the
heart
towards
his
he
not
what
i
could
wish
but
he
a
man
of
the
world
and
might
give
us
some
practical
advice
said
the
squire
with
his
anxious
looks
of
what
possible
advantage
advice
practical
or
otherwise
could
have
been
in
the
circumstances
it
was
difficult
to
see
but
the
squire
was
a
man
of
simple
mind
and
still
believed
in
the
suggestions
of
wisdom
he
still
sat
in
the
looking
wistfully
at
jack
and
with
a
certain
faith
that
matters
might
even
yet
be
mended
if
the
counsel
of
his
eldest
son
as
a
man
of
the
world
could
be
had
and
could
be
trusted
when
frank
who
had
an
afternoon
service
at
wharfside
had
to
leave
the
family
committee
gerald
who
roused
up
when
his
younger
brother
mentioned
the
business
he
was
going
upon
looked
at
frank
almost
as
wistfully
as
his
father
looked
at
jack
it
may
be
the
last
time
he
said
to
himself
if
you
let
me
i
go
with
you
frank
and
so
the
little
conclave
was
broken
up
the
people
in
prickett
lane
were
greatly
impressed
by
the
aspect
of
gerald
wentworth
as
he
went
silent
and
pale
by
his
brother
side
down
the
crowded
pavement
they
thought
it
must
be
a
bishop
at
least
who
accompanied
the
curate
of
st
roque
and
the
women
gathered
at
a
little
distance
and
made
their
comments
as
he
stood
waiting
for
his
brother
after
the
service
he
do
look
weakly
nor
sickly
no
more
nor
the
clergyman
said
one
but
he
smiles
at
the
little
uns
for
all
the
world
like
my
man
smiled
the
night
he
was
took
away
smilin
or
not
smilin
said
another
i
do
see
as
it
makes
no
matter
but
i
give
a
deal
to
know
what
elsworthy
and
them
as
stands
by
elsworthy
can
say
after
that
maybe
then
he
give
the
poor
fatherless
children
a
blessing
afore
go
suggested
a
poor
irish
widow
who
having
been
much
under
mr
wentworth
hands
in
her
trouble
was
not
quite
sure
now
what
faith
she
professed
or
at
least
which
church
she
belonged
to
such
was
the
universal
sentiment
of
prickett
lane
meanwhile
gerald
stood
silent
and
looked
with
pathetic
speechless
eyes
at
the
little
crowd
he
was
no
priest
now
he
was
shorn
of
the
profession
which
had
been
his
life
his
hope
of
being
able
to
resign
all
things
for
christ
sake
had
failed
him
too
wary
and
politic
to
maintain
in
a
critical
age
and
country
the
old
licence
of
the
ages
of
faith
even
his
wife
consent
could
he
have
obtained
it
would
not
have
opened
to
the
convert
the
way
into
the
priesthood
a
greater
trial
had
been
required
of
him
he
was
nothing
a
man
whose
career
was
over
he
stood
idly
in
a
kind
of
languor
looking
on
while
the
curate
performed
the
duties
of
his
office
feeling
like
a
man
whom
sickness
had
reduced
to
the
last
stage
of
life
and
for
whom
no
earthly
business
remained
while
at
the
same
time
his
aspect
struck
awe
as
that
of
a
bishop
at
the
least
to
the
imagination
of
prickett
lane
chapter
xxxix
mr
morgan
did
not
go
home
direct
from
the
investigation
of
the
morning
on
the
contrary
he
paid
various
visits
and
got
through
a
considerable
amount
of
parish
business
before
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
rectory
on
the
whole
his
feelings
were
far
from
being
comfortable
he
did
not
know
certainly
who
mr
wentworth
witness
was
but
he
had
an
unpleasant
conviction
that
it
was
somebody
who
would
clear
the
curate
of
course
i
shall
be
very
glad
the
rector
said
to
himself
but
it
is
a
fact
that
in
reality
he
was
far
from
being
glad
and
that
a
secret
conviction
of
this
sentiment
stealing
into
his
mind
made
matters
still
more
uncomfortable
this
private
sense
of
wishing
evil
to
another
man
of
being
unwilling
and
vexed
to
think
well
of
his
neighbour
was
in
itself
enough
to
disturb
the
rector
tranquillity
and
when
to
this
was
added
the
aggravation
that
his
wife
had
always
been
on
the
other
side
and
had
warned
him
against
proceeding
and
might
if
she
pleased
say
i
told
you
so
it
will
be
apparent
that
mr
morgan
uneasiness
was
not
without
foundation
instead
of
going
home
direct
to
acquaint
his
wife
with
the
circumstances
about
which
he
knew
she
must
be
curious
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
the
rector
opened
his
own
gate
even
then
he
went
through
the
garden
with
a
reluctant
step
feeling
it
still
more
difficult
to
meet
her
now
than
it
would
have
been
at
first
although
his
delay
had
arisen
from
the
thought
that
it
would
be
easier
to
encounter
her
keen
looks
after
an
interval
there
was
however
no
keen
look
to
be
dreaded
at
this
moment
mrs
morgan
was
busy
with
her
ferns
and
she
did
not
look
up
as
her
husband
approached
she
went
on
with
her
occupation
examining
carefully
what
withered
fronds
there
might
be
about
her
favourite
maidenhair
even
when
he
stopped
by
her
side
though
her
husband
shadow
fell
across
the
plants
she
was
tending
mrs
morgan
for
the
first
time
in
her
married
life
did
not
look
up
to
welcome
the
rector
she
made
no
demonstration
said
no
word
of
displeasure
but
only
showed
herself
utterly
absorbed
in
and
devoted
to
her
ferns
there
was
to
be
sure
no
such
lover
of
ferns
in
the
neighbourhood
of
carlingford
as
the
rector
wife
as
for
mr
morgan
he
stood
by
her
side
in
a
state
of
great
discomfort
and
discomfiture
the
good
man
perceptions
were
not
very
clear
but
he
saw
that
she
had
heard
from
some
one
the
issue
of
the
inquiry
and
that
she
was
deeply
offended
by
his
delay
and
that
in
short
they
had
arrived
at
a
serious
difference
the
first
quarrel
since
their
marriage
feeling
himself
in
the
wrong
mr
morgan
naturally
grew
angry
too
i
should
like
to
have
dinner
earlier
he
said
with
the
usual
indiscretion
of
an
aggrieved
husband
perhaps
you
will
tell
the
cook
my
dear
i
think
i
should
like
to
have
it
at
five
if
possible
it
ca
make
much
difference
for
one
day
mrs
morgan
raised
herself
up
from
her
ferns
and
no
doubt
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
find
herself
provided
with
so
just
a
cause
of
displeasure
much
difference
cried
the
rector
wife
it
is
four
now
i
wonder
how
you
could
think
of
such
a
thing
william
there
is
some
lamb
which
of
course
is
not
put
down
to
roast
yet
and
the
ducks
if
you
wish
the
cook
to
give
warning
immediately
you
may
send
such
a
message
it
is
just
like
a
man
to
think
it
would
make
no
difference
but
i
must
say
to
do
them
justice
said
the
rector
wife
it
is
not
like
a
man
of
your
college
when
she
had
fired
this
double
arrow
she
took
off
her
gardening
gloves
and
lifted
her
basket
i
suppose
you
told
mr
proctor
that
you
wished
to
dine
early
said
mrs
morgan
with
severity
pausing
on
the
threshold
of
course
it
is
quite
impossible
to
have
dinner
at
five
unless
he
knows
indeed
i
i
forgot
all
about
proctor
said
the
rector
who
now
saw
the
inexpediency
of
his
proposal
on
second
thoughts
i
see
it
does
not
matter
much
but
after
dinner
i
expect
some
people
about
mr
wentworth
business
it
was
not
settled
this
morning
as
i
expected
so
i
heard
said
mrs
morgan
i
will
tell
thomas
to
show
them
into
the
library
and
she
went
indoors
carrying
her
basket
as
for
the
rector
he
stood
silent
looking
after
her
and
feeling
wonderfully
discomfited
had
she
found
fault
with
him
for
his
delay
had
she
even
said
i
told
you
so
it
would
have
been
less
overwhelming
than
this
indifference
they
had
never
had
a
quarrel
before
and
the
effect
was
proportionately
increased
after
standing
bewildered
at
the
door
for
a
few
minutes
he
retired
into
his
study
where
the
change
in
his
demeanour
haunted
him
and
obscured
mr
wentworth
mrs
morgan
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
at
dinner
with
an
equal
want
of
curiosity
even
when
the
subject
was
discussed
between
the
rector
and
mr
proctor
she
asked
no
questions
a
course
of
procedure
very
puzzling
and
trying
to
mr
morgan
who
could
not
make
it
out
it
was
after
eight
before
the
tribunal
of
the
morning
was
reconstituted
at
the
rectory
most
of
the
gentlemen
came
late
and
the
little
assembly
brought
with
it
a
flavour
of
port
which
modified
the
serious
atmosphere
when
the
bed
of
justice
was
again
formed
mr
wentworth
entered
with
the
bodyguard
of
wentworths
which
numbered
half
as
many
as
his
judges
half
from
curiosity
half
from
a
reluctant
inclination
to
please
his
father
jack
had
joined
the
others
and
they
came
in
together
all
of
them
noticeable
men
profoundly
different
yet
identified
as
belonging
to
each
other
by
the
touching
bond
of
family
resemblance
after
the
four
gentlemen
had
taken
possession
of
their
corner
mr
waters
made
a
somewhat
hurried
entry
bringing
after
him
the
sullen
reluctant
figure
of
wodehouse
who
made
an
awkward
bow
to
the
assembled
potentates
and
looked
ashamed
and
vigilant
and
very
ill
at
ease
mr
waters
made
a
hasty
explanation
to
the
rector
before
he
sat
down
by
the
side
of
his
unlucky
client
i
thought
it
possible
there
might
be
some
attempt
made
to
shift
the
blame
upon
him
therefore
i
thought
it
best
to
bring
him
said
the
lawyer
mr
morgan
gave
him
a
dry
little
nod
without
answering
to
tell
the
truth
the
rector
felt
anything
but
comfortable
when
he
glanced
up
at
the
stranger
who
was
looking
askance
at
the
people
in
the
room
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
policemen
in
disguise
a
disagreeable
sudden
conviction
that
this
sullen
rascal
looked
a
great
deal
more
like
the
guilty
man
than
mr
wentworth
did
came
into
mr
morgan
mind
and
made
him
sick
with
annoyance
and
embarrassment
if
it
should
turn
out
so
if
it
should
become
apparent
that
he
for
private
prejudices
of
his
own
had
been
persecuting
his
brother
this
thought
produced
an
actual
physical
effect
for
the
moment
upon
the
rector
but
its
immediate
visible
consequence
was
simply
to
make
him
look
more
severe
almost
spiteful
in
a
kind
of
unconscious
last
of
all
elsworthy
who
began
to
be
frightened
too
but
whose
fears
were
mingled
with
no
compunction
nor
blame
of
himself
stole
in
and
found
an
uncomfortable
seat
on
a
stool
near
the
door
where
scarcely
any
one
saw
him
by
favour
of
thomas
and
screened
by
the
high
back
of
the
rector
when
all
were
assembled
mr
morgan
spoke
we
are
met
this
evening
gentlemen
to
complete
if
there
is
sufficient
time
the
investigation
we
began
this
morning
said
the
rector
i
have
no
doubt
i
express
the
sentiments
of
every
one
present
when
i
say
i
shall
be
glad
glad
said
mr
morgan
with
a
defiant
emphasis
which
was
meant
to
convince
himself
to
find
that
mr
wentworth
witness
is
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
the
delay
as
we
were
interrupted
this
morning
solely
on
his
account
i
presume
it
will
be
most
satisfactory
that
this
witness
should
be
called
at
once
i
should
like
to
say
something
in
the
first
place
said
the
curate
mr
morgan
made
an
abrupt
nod
indicative
of
his
consent
and
instead
of
looking
at
the
defendant
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
made
figures
with
his
pen
upon
the
a
conviction
against
which
it
was
impossible
to
strive
had
taken
possession
of
the
rector
soul
he
listened
to
frank
wentworth
address
with
a
kind
of
impatient
annoyance
and
resistance
what
is
the
good
of
saying
any
more
about
it
mr
morgan
was
saying
in
his
soul
for
heaven
sake
let
us
bury
it
and
be
done
with
it
and
forget
that
we
ever
made
such
asses
of
ourselves
but
at
the
same
time
the
rector
knew
this
was
quite
impossible
and
as
he
sat
leaning
over
his
writing
down
millions
after
millions
with
his
unconscious
pen
he
looked
a
very
model
of
an
unwilling
listener
a
prejudiced
judge
a
man
whom
no
arguments
could
convince
which
was
the
aspect
under
which
he
appeared
to
the
curate
of
st
roque
i
should
like
to
say
something
first
said
the
perpetual
curate
i
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
i
being
tolerably
well
known
in
carlingford
as
i
have
always
supposed
could
be
suspected
by
any
rational
being
of
such
an
insane
piece
of
wickedness
as
has
been
laid
to
my
charge
and
consequently
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
vindicate
myself
as
i
perhaps
ought
to
have
done
at
the
beginning
i
have
been
careless
all
along
of
vindicating
myself
i
had
an
idea
said
the
young
man
with
involuntary
disdain
that
i
might
trust
if
not
to
the
regard
at
least
to
the
of
my
friends
here
john
brown
who
was
near
his
unwary
client
plucked
at
the
curate
coat
and
brought
him
to
a
momentary
pause
softly
softly
said
dr
marjoribanks
has
nothing
to
do
with
facts
we
inquiring
into
facts
at
this
moment
and
besides
it
a
very
foolish
and
unjustifiable
confidence
to
trust
to
any
man
said
the
old
doctor
with
a
humorous
glance
from
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
at
his
upon
which
there
ensued
a
laugh
not
very
agreeable
in
its
tone
which
brought
the
rector
to
a
white
heat
of
impatience
and
secret
rage
it
appears
to
me
that
the
witness
ought
to
be
called
at
once
said
mr
morgan
if
this
is
not
a
mere
expedient
to
gain
time
and
if
it
is
intended
to
make
any
progress
my
explanations
shall
be
very
brief
said
frank
wentworth
facing
instantly
to
his
natural
enemy
i
have
suspected
from
the
beginning
of
this
business
who
was
the
culprit
and
have
made
every
possible
attempt
to
induce
him
to
confess
and
so
far
as
he
could
amend
the
wrong
that
he
had
done
i
have
failed
and
now
the
confession
the
must
be
made
in
public
i
will
now
call
my
witness
said
the
curate
but
this
time
a
commotion
rose
in
another
part
of
the
room
it
was
wodehouse
who
struggled
to
rise
and
to
get
free
from
the
detaining
grasp
of
his
companion
by
jove
i
aint
going
to
sit
here
and
listen
to
a
parcel
of
lies
cried
the
vagabond
if
i
am
to
be
tried
at
least
i
have
the
real
thing
by
jove
he
had
risen
up
and
was
endeavouring
to
pass
mr
waters
and
get
out
casting
a
suspicious
defiant
look
round
the
room
the
noise
he
made
turned
all
eyes
upon
him
and
the
scrutiny
he
had
brought
upon
himself
redoubled
his
anxiety
to
get
away
i
not
stand
it
by
jove
waters
let
me
go
said
the
craven
whose
confused
imagination
had
mixed
up
all
his
evil
doings
together
and
who
already
felt
himself
being
carried
off
to
prison
it
was
at
this
moment
that
jack
wentworth
rose
from
his
place
in
his
easy
careless
way
and
went
forward
to
the
table
to
adjust
the
lamp
which
was
flaring
a
little
wodehouse
dropped
back
into
a
chair
as
soon
as
he
caught
the
eye
of
this
master
of
his
fate
his
big
beard
moved
with
a
subterranean
gasp
like
the
panting
of
a
hunted
creature
and
all
the
colour
that
had
remained
died
away
out
of
his
haggard
frightened
face
as
for
jack
wentworth
he
took
no
apparent
notice
of
the
shabby
rascal
whom
he
held
in
awe
rather
warm
this
room
for
a
court
of
justice
i
hope
frank
witness
is
not
fat
said
jack
putting
himself
up
against
the
wall
and
lifting
languidly
his
glass
to
his
eye
which
byplay
was
somewhat
startling
but
totally
incomprehensible
to
the
amateur
judges
who
looked
upon
him
with
angry
eyes
i
must
request
that
the
proceedings
may
not
be
interrupted
said
mr
morgan
and
then
everybody
looked
towards
the
open
door
the
sight
they
saw
there
was
enough
to
startle
the
calmest
spectator
elsworthy
who
was
seated
close
by
sprang
from
his
stool
with
a
low
resounding
howl
of
amazement
upsetting
his
lowly
seat
and
staggering
back
against
the
wall
in
the
excess
of
his
wonder
and
consternation
the
judges
themselves
forgot
their
decorum
and
crowded
round
upon
each
other
to
stare
old
mr
western
putting
his
arm
round
the
rector
neck
in
his
curiosity
as
if
they
had
been
two
boys
at
a
it
was
miss
leonora
wentworth
erect
figure
that
appeared
in
the
doorway
half
leading
in
half
pushing
before
her
the
unfortunate
cause
of
all
the
commotion
rosa
elsworthy
herself
a
change
had
passed
upon
the
little
girl
rosy
dewy
april
beauty
her
pretty
dark
eyes
were
enlarged
and
anxious
and
full
of
tears
her
cheeks
had
paled
out
of
their
sweet
colour
her
red
lips
were
pressed
tightly
together
passion
and
shame
had
set
their
marks
upon
the
child
forehead
lightly
it
is
true
but
still
the
traces
were
there
but
beyond
all
other
sentiments
anxiety
restless
breathless
palpitating
had
possession
of
mr
wentworth
witness
it
was
very
clear
that
whatever
might
be
the
opinion
of
her
judges
rosa
case
was
anything
but
hopeless
in
her
own
eyes
she
came
in
drooping
shrinking
and
abashed
as
was
natural
but
her
shame
was
secondary
in
rosa
mind
even
in
the
moment
of
her
humiliation
she
came
to
a
dead
stop
when
she
had
made
a
few
steps
into
the
room
and
cast
furtive
glances
at
the
dread
tribunal
and
began
to
cry
she
was
trembling
with
nervous
eagerness
with
petulance
and
impatience
almost
all
her
judges
except
the
rector
and
mr
proctor
had
been
known
to
rosa
from
her
earliest
years
she
was
not
afraid
of
them
nor
cast
down
by
any
sense
of
overwhelming
transgression
on
the
contrary
she
cast
an
appealing
look
round
her
which
implied
that
they
could
still
set
everything
right
if
they
would
exert
themselves
and
then
she
began
to
cry
gentlemen
before
you
ask
any
questions
said
miss
leonora
wentworth
i
should
like
to
explain
why
i
am
here
i
came
not
because
i
approve
of
but
because
it
is
right
that
my
nephew
should
have
a
respectable
woman
to
take
charge
of
the
witness
she
was
brought
to
my
house
last
night
and
has
been
in
my
charge
ever
since
and
i
come
with
her
now
not
because
i
approve
of
her
but
because
she
ought
to
be
in
charge
of
some
woman
said
miss
leonora
sitting
down
abruptly
in
the
chair
some
one
had
placed
for
her
the
chair
was
placed
close
by
the
spot
where
rosa
stood
crying
poor
pretty
forsaken
child
perhaps
miss
leonora
who
sat
beside
her
and
occupied
the
position
of
her
protector
was
of
all
the
people
present
the
only
one
who
had
not
already
forgiven
rosa
the
only
one
who
would
have
still
been
disposed
to
punish
her
and
did
not
pardon
the
weeping
creature
in
her
heart
now
that
you
here
rosa
said
dr
marjoribanks
the
only
sensible
thing
you
can
do
is
to
dry
your
eyes
and
answer
the
questions
that
have
to
be
put
to
you
nobody
will
harm
you
if
you
speak
the
truth
do
be
frightened
but
dry
your
eyes
and
let
us
hear
what
you
have
to
say
poor
little
thing
said
old
mr
western
of
course
she
has
done
very
wrong
i
do
mean
to
defend
her
but
after
all
she
is
but
a
child
poor
little
thing
her
mother
died
you
know
when
she
was
a
baby
she
had
nobody
to
tell
her
how
to
i
do
mean
to
defend
her
for
she
has
done
very
wrong
poor
little
we
are
falling
into
mere
conversation
said
the
rector
severely
rosa
elsworthy
come
to
the
table
the
only
thing
you
can
do
to
make
up
for
all
the
misery
you
have
caused
to
your
friends
is
to
tell
the
truth
about
everything
you
are
aged
how
much
eighteen
years
please
sir
only
seventeen
said
rosa
and
oh
please
sir
i
did
mean
no
harm
i
would
never
have
gone
no
not
a
step
if
he
had
that
we
was
to
be
married
oh
please
sir
softly
a
little
said
john
brown
interfering
it
is
not
you
who
are
on
your
trial
rosa
we
are
not
going
to
question
you
about
your
foolishness
all
that
the
rector
wants
you
to
tell
him
is
the
name
of
the
man
who
persuaded
you
to
go
away
at
which
question
rosa
cried
more
and
more
i
do
think
he
meant
no
harm
either
cried
the
poor
little
girl
oh
if
somebody
would
please
speak
to
him
we
could
be
married
then
but
now
if
anybody
would
take
a
little
trouble
i
told
him
mr
wentworth
would
if
i
was
to
ask
him
but
then
i
thought
perhaps
as
mr
wentworth
might
like
to
be
the
one
as
married
me
said
rosa
with
a
momentary
gleam
of
vanity
through
her
tears
the
little
simper
with
which
the
girl
spoke
the
coquettish
looks
askance
at
the
perpetual
curate
who
stood
grave
and
unmoved
at
a
distance
the
movement
of
unconscious
and
girlish
vanity
which
for
a
moment
distracted
rosa
had
a
great
effect
upon
the
spectators
the
judges
looked
at
each
other
across
the
table
and
dr
marjoribanks
made
a
commentary
of
meditative
nods
upon
that
little
exhibition
just
so
said
the
doctor
maybe
mr
wentworth
might
have
objected
if
you
tell
me
the
man
name
speak
to
him
rosa
said
the
old
scotsman
grimly
as
for
the
rector
he
had
put
down
his
pen
altogether
and
looked
very
much
as
if
he
were
the
culprit
certainly
his
shame
and
confusion
and
were
greater
than
that
of
any
one
else
in
the
room
oh
doctor
please
do
be
angry
oh
if
somebody
would
only
speak
to
him
cried
poor
rosa
oh
please
it
was
my
fault
i
got
no
nobody
to
speak
for
me
at
this
moment
she
got
a
glimpse
of
her
uncle
face
dark
and
angry
looming
behind
the
rector
chair
rosa
shrank
back
with
a
frightened
movement
and
caught
fast
hold
of
miss
leonora
dress
oh
please
do
let
him
kill
me
cried
the
terrified
girl
she
sank
down
at
miss
wentworth
feet
and
held
tightly
by
her
unwilling
protectress
she
was
a
frightened
child
afraid
of
being
whipped
and
punished
she
was
not
an
outraged
woman
forsaken
and
miserable
nobody
knew
what
to
do
with
her
as
she
crouched
down
panting
with
fright
and
anxiety
by
miss
side
we
must
know
who
this
man
is
said
john
brown
look
here
rosa
if
anybody
is
to
do
you
good
it
is
necessary
to
know
the
man
rise
up
and
look
round
and
tell
me
if
you
can
see
him
here
after
a
moment
interval
rosa
obeyed
she
stood
up
trembling
resting
her
hand
to
support
herself
on
miss
leonora
chair
almost
she
trembled
so
on
miss
leonora
shoulder
up
to
this
moment
the
ignorant
little
creature
had
scarcely
felt
the
shame
of
her
position
she
had
felt
only
the
necessity
of
appealing
to
the
kindness
of
people
who
knew
her
people
who
were
powerful
enough
to
do
very
nearly
what
they
pleased
in
carlingford
for
it
was
in
this
light
that
rosa
who
knew
no
better
regarded
the
doctor
and
her
other
judges
this
time
her
eye
passed
quickly
over
those
protectors
the
tears
were
still
hanging
on
her
eyelashes
her
childish
bosom
was
still
palpitating
with
sobs
beyond
the
little
circle
of
light
round
the
table
the
room
was
comparatively
in
shadow
she
stood
by
herself
her
pretty
face
and
anxious
eyes
appearing
over
miss
wentworth
head
her
fright
and
her
anxiety
both
forgotten
for
the
moment
in
the
sudden
hope
of
seeing
her
betrayer
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
room
to
disturb
the
impartiality
of
her
search
every
man
kept
still
as
if
by
chance
he
might
be
the
offender
rosa
eyes
bright
with
anxiety
with
eagerness
with
a
feverish
hope
went
searching
into
the
shadow
gleaming
harmless
over
the
wentworth
brothers
who
were
opposite
then
there
was
a
start
and
a
loud
cry
she
was
not
ashamed
to
be
led
before
the
old
men
who
were
sorry
for
her
and
who
could
protect
her
but
now
at
last
the
instinct
of
her
womanhood
seized
upon
the
unfortunate
creature
she
had
made
an
involuntary
rush
towards
him
when
she
saw
him
first
then
she
stopped
short
and
looked
all
round
her
with
a
bewildered
sudden
consciousness
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
scorching
and
burning
she
uttered
a
sudden
cry
of
anguish
and
shame
oh
do
forsake
me
do
forsake
me
listen
to
the
gentlemen
cried
poor
rosa
and
fell
down
in
a
sudden
agony
of
at
wodehouse
feet
for
a
few
minutes
after
there
was
nothing
but
confusion
in
the
room
elsworthy
had
been
standing
behind
backs
with
a
look
of
rage
and
disappointment
on
his
commonplace
features
let
them
help
her
as
likes
i
washes
my
hands
of
her
he
cried
bitterly
when
he
saw
her
fall
and
then
rushed
into
the
midst
of
the
room
thrusting
the
others
out
of
his
way
the
man
was
beside
himself
with
mortification
with
disgust
and
fury
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
savage
natural
affection
for
the
creature
who
had
baffled
and
disgraced
him
yet
still
was
his
own
let
alone
let
alone
i
tell
you
there
nobody
as
belongs
to
her
but
me
cried
elsworthy
pushing
up
against
the
doctor
who
had
lifted
her
from
the
ground
as
for
wodehouse
he
was
standing
scowling
down
upon
the
pretty
figure
at
his
feet
not
that
the
vagabond
was
utterly
heartless
or
could
look
at
his
victim
without
emotion
on
the
contrary
he
was
pale
with
terror
thinking
he
had
killed
her
wondering
in
his
miserable
heart
if
they
would
secure
him
at
once
and
furtively
watching
the
door
to
see
if
he
had
a
chance
of
escape
when
mr
waters
seized
his
arm
wodehouse
gave
a
hoarse
outcry
of
horror
i
marry
her
oh
lord
i
marry
her
i
never
meant
anything
else
the
wretched
man
cried
as
he
sank
back
again
into
his
chair
he
thought
she
was
dead
as
she
lay
with
her
upturned
face
on
the
carpet
and
in
his
terror
and
remorse
and
cowardice
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
if
he
could
have
had
a
chance
of
escaping
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
dash
the
old
doctor
out
of
his
way
and
rush
over
the
body
of
the
unhappy
girl
whom
he
thought
he
had
murdered
but
waters
held
him
fast
and
he
sank
back
panting
and
horrified
on
his
seat
i
never
touched
her
nobody
can
say
i
touched
her
muttered
the
poor
wretch
to
himself
and
watched
with
fascinated
eyes
and
the
distinct
apprehension
of
terror
every
movement
and
change
of
position
calculating
how
he
might
dart
out
when
the
window
was
opened
having
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
jack
wentworth
as
well
as
the
companion
who
kept
immediate
watch
over
him
was
in
the
room
she
come
to
herself
presently
said
dr
marjoribanks
we
carry
her
yes
i
know
you
do
approve
of
her
miss
wentworth
nobody
said
you
were
to
approve
of
her
not
that
i
think
she
a
responsible
moral
agent
myself
said
the
doctor
lifting
her
up
in
his
vigorous
arms
but
in
the
mean
time
she
has
to
be
brought
to
life
keep
out
of
my
way
elsworthy
you
should
have
looked
better
after
the
little
fool
if
she
not
accountable
for
her
actions
are
he
went
on
with
a
growl
thrusting
away
with
his
vigorous
shoulder
the
frame
of
rosa
uncle
who
was
no
match
for
the
doctor
thus
the
poor
little
girl
was
carried
away
in
a
kind
of
procession
miss
leonora
going
first
not
that
i
think
her
worth
all
this
fuss
the
vain
little
fool
said
miss
leonora
she
come
to
herself
no
fear
of
her
but
notwithstanding
her
protest
the
woman
led
the
way
when
the
room
was
cleared
the
gentlemen
who
remained
took
their
seats
mechanically
and
stared
at
each
other
in
the
shame
and
confusion
of
the
moment
nobody
could
find
anything
to
say
and
the
curate
was
magnanimous
and
did
not
take
advantage
of
his
triumph
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
rector
who
rose
up
solemnly
from
his
chair
to
speak
probably
no
one
in
the
room
had
suffered
so
acutely
as
mr
morgan
his
face
was
crimson
his
eyes
suffused
and
angry
frank
wentworth
rose
involuntarily
at
the
same
moment
expecting
he
could
not
tell
why
to
be
addressed
but
sat
down
again
in
a
little
confusion
when
he
found
that
the
rector
had
turned
his
eyes
in
a
totally
different
direction
mr
morgan
put
the
lamp
out
of
the
way
that
he
might
be
able
to
transfix
with
the
full
glow
of
his
angry
eyes
the
real
offender
who
sat
only
half
conscious
absorbed
with
his
own
terror
by
the
lawyer
side
sir
said
the
rector
in
a
tone
which
severe
as
his
voice
was
by
nature
nobody
had
ever
heard
from
his
lips
before
you
have
put
us
all
in
a
most
ridiculous
and
painful
position
i
do
know
whether
you
are
capable
of
feeling
the
vileness
of
your
own
misconduct
as
regards
the
unhappy
girl
who
has
just
been
carried
out
of
the
room
but
you
certainly
shall
not
leave
the
house
without
hearing
wodehouse
gave
such
a
start
at
these
words
that
mr
morgan
paused
a
moment
the
rector
was
quite
unaware
of
the
relief
the
sense
of
safety
which
he
had
inadvertently
conveyed
to
the
mind
of
the
shabby
rascal
whom
he
was
addressing
he
was
then
to
be
allowed
to
leave
the
house
i
leave
the
d
d
place
by
jove
he
muttered
in
his
beard
and
immediately
sat
up
upon
his
chair
and
turned
round
with
a
kind
of
sullen
vivacity
to
listen
to
the
remainder
of
mr
morgan
speech
you
shall
not
leave
this
house
said
the
rector
more
peremptorily
still
without
hearing
what
must
be
the
opinion
of
every
gentleman
of
every
honest
man
you
have
been
the
occasion
of
bringing
an
utterly
unfounded
accusation
against
a
a
young
clergyman
said
mr
morgan
with
a
succession
of
gasps
of
of
the
very
highest
character
you
have
as
i
understand
sir
abused
his
hospitality
and
and
done
your
utmost
to
injure
him
when
you
owed
him
gratitude
not
content
with
that
sir
continued
the
rector
you
have
kept
your
your
very
existence
concealed
until
the
moment
when
you
could
injure
your
sisters
you
may
perhaps
be
able
to
make
a
miserable
amends
for
the
wrong
you
have
done
to
the
unfortunate
girl
but
you
can
never
make
amends
to
me
sir
for
betraying
me
into
a
ridiculous
position
and
leading
me
to
do
an
an
absurd
and
and
incredible
injustice
to
a
to
my
to
mr
frank
wentworth
sir
you
are
a
scoundrel
cried
mr
morgan
breaking
down
abruptly
in
an
access
of
sudden
fury
when
the
rector
had
recovered
himself
he
turned
with
great
severity
to
the
rest
of
the
company
gentlemen
my
wife
will
be
glad
to
see
you
said
mr
morgan
the
sound
of
this
hospitable
invitation
was
as
if
he
had
ordered
the
entire
assembly
to
the
door
but
nevertheless
most
of
the
company
followed
him
as
he
rose
and
without
condescending
to
look
round
again
marched
out
of
the
library
the
squire
rose
with
the
rest
and
took
the
hand
of
his
son
frank
and
grasped
it
closely
somehow
though
he
believed
frank
before
mr
wentworth
was
easier
in
his
mind
after
the
rector
speech
i
think
i
will
go
and
shake
hands
with
him
said
the
squire
and
you
had
better
come
too
frank
no
doubt
he
will
expect
it
he
spoke
up
very
well
at
the
last
and
i
entirely
agree
with
the
rector
he
said
looking
sternly
but
with
a
little
curiosity
at
the
vagabond
who
stood
recovering
himself
and
ready
to
resume
his
hopeless
swagger
it
was
well
for
mr
wentworth
that
he
left
the
room
at
once
and
went
cheerfully
to
pay
his
respects
to
mrs
morgan
the
squire
said
thank
god
quietly
to
himself
when
he
got
out
of
the
library
things
are
mending
surely
even
jack
even
jack
mr
wentworth
said
under
his
breath
and
the
simple
gentleman
said
over
a
part
of
the
general
thanksgiving
as
he
went
slowly
with
an
unusual
gladness
up
the
stair
he
might
not
have
entered
mrs
morgan
with
such
a
relieved
and
brightened
countenance
had
he
stayed
ten
minutes
longer
in
the
library
and
listened
to
the
further
conversation
there
chapter
xl
now
mr
wodehouse
said
jack
wentworth
it
appears
that
you
and
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
each
other
they
had
all
risen
when
the
other
gentlemen
followed
mr
morgan
out
of
the
room
and
those
who
remained
stood
in
a
group
surrounding
the
unhappy
culprit
and
renewing
his
impression
of
personal
danger
when
he
heard
himself
thus
addressed
he
backed
against
the
wall
and
instinctively
took
one
of
the
chairs
and
placed
it
before
him
his
furtive
eye
sought
the
door
and
the
window
investigating
the
chances
of
escape
when
he
saw
that
there
was
none
he
withdrew
still
a
step
further
back
and
stood
at
bay
by
jove
i
aint
going
to
stand
all
this
said
wodehouse
as
if
every
fellow
had
a
right
to
bully
me
it
more
than
flesh
and
blood
can
put
up
with
i
do
care
for
that
old
fogey
that
gone
but
by
jove
i
wo
stand
any
more
from
men
that
eat
my
dinners
and
win
my
money
and
jack
wentworth
made
half
a
step
forward
with
a
superb
smile
my
good
fellow
you
should
never
reproach
a
man
with
his
good
actions
he
said
but
at
the
same
time
having
eaten
your
dinners
as
you
describe
i
have
a
certain
claim
on
your
gratitude
we
have
had
some
a
business
connection
for
some
years
i
do
say
you
have
reason
to
be
actually
grateful
for
that
but
at
least
it
brought
you
now
and
then
into
the
society
of
gentlemen
a
man
who
robs
a
set
of
women
and
leaves
the
poor
creature
he
has
ruined
destitute
is
a
sort
of
cur
we
have
nothing
to
say
to
said
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
contemptuously
we
do
not
pretend
to
be
saints
but
we
are
not
blackguards
that
is
to
say
said
jack
with
a
perfectly
calm
and
harmonious
smile
not
in
theory
nor
in
our
own
opinion
the
fact
accordingly
is
my
friend
that
you
must
choose
between
and
those
respectable
meannesses
of
yours
by
jove
the
fellow
ought
to
have
been
a
shopkeeper
and
as
honest
as
diogenes
said
jack
he
stood
looking
at
his
wretched
associate
with
the
overwhelming
impertinence
of
a
perfectly
man
no
way
concealing
the
contemptuous
inspection
with
which
his
cool
eyes
travelled
over
the
disconcerted
figure
from
top
to
toe
seeing
and
exaggerating
all
its
tremors
and
clumsy
guiltiness
the
chances
are
had
jack
wentworth
been
in
wodehouse
place
he
would
have
been
master
of
the
position
as
much
as
now
he
was
not
shocked
nor
indignant
like
his
brothers
he
was
simply
contemptuous
disdainful
not
so
much
of
the
wickedness
as
of
the
clumsy
and
shabby
fashion
in
which
it
had
been
accomplished
as
for
the
offender
who
had
been
defiant
in
his
sulky
fashion
up
to
this
moment
his
courage
oozed
out
at
his
under
jack
wentworth
eye
i
am
my
own
master
he
stammered
nowadays
i
aint
to
be
dictated
to
and
i
sha
be
by
jove
as
for
jack
wentworth
he
well
known
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
what
mr
wodehouse
said
the
serene
and
splendid
jack
interest
yourself
on
my
account
frank
this
is
my
business
at
present
if
you
have
any
in
hand
we
can
spare
you
and
do
forget
our
respectable
friend
in
your
supplications
favour
us
with
your
definition
of
jack
wentworth
mr
wodehouse
he
is
neither
more
nor
less
by
jove
i
aint
going
to
stand
it
cried
wodehouse
if
a
to
be
driven
mad
and
insulted
and
have
his
money
won
from
him
and
made
game
of
not
to
say
tossed
about
as
i
been
among
and
made
a
drudge
of
and
set
to
do
the
dirty
work
said
the
unfortunate
subordinate
with
a
touch
of
pathos
in
his
hoarse
voice
i
mean
to
say
i
been
what
i
ought
but
by
jove
to
be
put
upon
as
i
been
and
knocked
about
and
at
the
last
they
have
the
pluck
to
stand
by
a
fellow
by
jove
muttered
mr
wodehouse
unlucky
heir
what
further
exasperation
his
smiling
superior
intended
to
heap
upon
him
nobody
could
tell
for
just
as
jack
wentworth
was
about
to
speak
and
just
as
wodehouse
had
again
faced
towards
him
gerald
who
had
been
looking
on
in
silence
came
forward
out
of
the
shadow
he
had
seen
all
and
heard
all
from
that
moral
deathbed
of
his
where
no
personal
cares
could
again
disturb
him
and
though
he
had
resigned
his
office
he
could
not
belie
his
nature
he
came
in
by
instinct
to
cherish
the
dawn
of
compunction
which
appeared
as
he
thought
in
the
sinner
words
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
you
said
gerald
at
the
sound
of
whose
voice
everybody
started
is
to
find
out
that
the
wages
of
sin
are
bitter
do
expect
any
sympathy
or
consolation
from
those
who
have
helped
you
to
do
wrong
my
brother
tries
to
induce
you
to
do
a
right
act
from
an
unworthy
motive
he
says
your
former
associates
will
not
acknowledge
you
my
advice
to
you
is
to
forsake
your
former
associates
my
brother
said
gerald
turning
aside
to
look
at
him
would
do
himself
honour
if
he
forsook
them
also
but
for
you
here
is
your
opportunity
you
have
no
temptation
of
poverty
now
take
the
first
step
and
forsake
them
i
have
no
motive
in
advising
you
except
indeed
that
i
am
jack
wentworth
brother
he
and
you
are
different
said
gerald
involuntarily
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
and
at
present
you
have
the
means
of
escape
go
now
and
leave
them
said
the
man
who
was
a
priest
by
nature
the
light
returned
to
his
eye
while
he
spoke
he
was
no
longer
passive
contemplating
his
own
moral
death
his
natural
office
had
come
back
to
him
unawares
he
stretched
his
arm
towards
the
door
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
escape
of
the
sinner
go
said
gerald
refuse
their
approbation
shun
their
society
for
christ
sake
and
not
for
theirs
make
amends
to
those
you
have
wronged
jack
i
command
you
to
let
him
go
jack
who
had
been
startled
at
first
had
recovered
himself
long
before
his
brother
ceased
to
speak
let
him
go
by
all
means
he
said
and
stood
superbly
indifferent
by
gerald
side
whistling
under
his
breath
a
tripping
lively
air
no
occasion
for
solemnity
the
sooner
he
goes
the
better
said
jack
in
short
i
see
no
reason
why
any
of
us
should
stay
now
the
business
is
accomplished
i
wonder
would
his
reverence
ever
forgive
me
if
i
lighted
my
cigar
he
took
out
his
case
as
he
spoke
and
began
to
look
over
its
contents
there
was
one
in
the
room
however
who
was
better
acquainted
with
the
indications
of
jack
wentworth
face
than
either
of
his
brothers
this
unfortunate
who
was
hanging
in
an
agony
of
uncertainty
over
the
chair
he
had
placed
before
him
watched
every
movement
of
his
leader
face
with
the
anxious
gaze
of
a
lover
hoping
to
see
a
little
corresponding
anxiety
in
it
but
watched
in
vain
wodehouse
had
been
going
through
a
fever
of
doubt
and
divided
impulses
the
shabby
fellow
was
open
to
good
impressions
though
he
was
not
much
in
the
way
of
practising
them
and
gerald
address
which
in
the
first
place
filled
him
with
awe
moved
him
afterwards
with
passing
thrills
of
compunction
mingled
with
a
kind
of
delight
at
the
idea
of
getting
free
when
his
admonitor
said
go
wodehouse
made
a
step
towards
the
door
and
for
an
instant
felt
the
exhilaration
of
enfranchisement
but
the
next
moment
his
eye
sought
jack
wentworth
face
which
was
so
superbly
careless
so
indifferent
to
him
and
his
intentions
and
the
vagabond
soul
succumbed
with
a
canine
fidelity
to
his
master
had
jack
shown
any
interest
any
excitement
in
the
matter
his
sway
might
have
been
doubtful
but
in
proportion
to
the
sense
of
his
own
insignificance
and
unimportance
wodehouse
allegiance
confirmed
itself
he
looked
wistfully
towards
the
hero
of
his
imagination
as
that
skilful
personage
selected
his
cigar
he
would
rather
have
been
kicked
again
than
left
alone
and
left
to
himself
after
all
it
was
very
true
what
jack
wentworth
said
they
might
be
a
bad
lot
but
they
were
gentlemen
according
to
wodehouse
understanding
of
the
word
with
whom
he
had
been
associated
and
beatific
visions
of
peers
and
baronets
and
honourables
amongst
whom
his
own
shabby
person
had
figured
without
feeling
much
below
the
common
level
crossed
his
mind
with
all
the
sweetness
which
belongs
to
a
past
state
of
affairs
yet
it
was
still
in
his
power
to
recall
these
vanishing
glories
now
that
he
was
rich
and
could
cut
a
figure
among
the
objects
of
his
admiration
was
that
brilliant
world
to
be
closed
upon
him
for
ever
by
his
own
obstinacy
as
these
thoughts
rushed
through
his
mind
little
rosa
beauty
and
natural
grace
came
suddenly
to
his
recollection
nobody
need
know
how
he
had
got
his
pretty
wife
and
a
pretty
wife
she
would
be
a
creature
whom
nobody
could
help
admiring
wodehouse
looked
wistfully
at
jack
wentworth
who
took
no
notice
of
him
as
he
chose
his
cigar
jack
was
not
only
the
ideal
of
the
clumsy
rogue
but
he
was
the
doorkeeper
of
that
paradise
of
disreputable
nobles
and
ruined
gentlemen
which
was
wodehouse
idea
of
good
society
and
from
all
this
was
he
about
to
be
banished
jack
wentworth
selected
his
cigar
with
as
much
care
as
if
his
happiness
depended
on
it
and
took
no
notice
of
the
stealthy
glances
thrown
at
him
i
get
a
light
in
the
hall
said
jack
good
evening
to
you
and
he
was
actually
going
away
look
here
said
wodehouse
hastily
in
his
beard
i
aint
a
man
to
forsake
old
friends
if
jack
wentworth
does
not
mean
anything
unreasonable
or
against
a
fellow
honour
hold
your
tongue
waters
by
jove
i
know
my
friends
i
know
you
would
never
have
been
one
of
them
but
for
jack
wentworth
he
not
the
common
sort
i
can
tell
you
he
the
greatest
swell
going
by
jove
cried
jack
admiring
follower
and
through
thick
and
thin
he
stood
by
me
i
aint
going
to
forsake
him
now
that
is
if
he
do
want
anything
that
goes
against
a
fellow
honour
said
the
repentant
prodigal
again
sinking
the
voice
which
he
had
raised
for
a
moment
as
he
spoke
he
looked
more
wistfully
than
ever
towards
his
leader
who
said
pshaw
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
put
back
his
cigar
this
room
is
too
hot
for
anything
said
jack
but
do
open
the
window
i
entreat
of
you
i
hate
to
assist
at
the
suicide
of
a
set
of
insane
insects
for
heaven
sake
frank
mind
what
you
doing
as
for
mr
wodehouse
remark
said
jack
lightly
i
trust
i
never
could
suggest
anything
which
would
wound
his
keen
sense
of
honour
i
advise
you
to
marry
and
settle
as
i
am
in
the
habit
of
advising
young
men
and
if
i
were
to
add
that
it
would
be
seemly
to
make
some
provision
for
your
sisters
stop
there
said
the
curate
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
scene
up
to
this
moment
he
had
stood
behind
rather
contemptuously
determined
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
ungrateful
and
ungenerous
protégé
but
now
an
unreasonable
impulse
forced
him
into
the
discussion
the
less
that
is
said
on
that
part
of
the
subject
the
better
he
said
with
some
natural
heat
i
object
to
the
mixing
up
of
names
which
which
no
one
here
has
any
right
to
bandy
about
that
is
very
true
said
mr
proctor
but
still
they
have
their
rights
the
late
rector
added
after
a
pause
we
have
no
right
to
stand
in
the
way
of
their
their
interest
you
know
it
occurred
to
mr
proctor
indeed
that
the
suggestion
was
on
the
whole
a
sensible
one
even
if
they
were
to
to
marry
you
know
they
might
still
be
left
unprovided
for
said
the
late
rector
i
think
it
is
quite
just
that
some
provision
should
be
made
for
that
and
then
there
was
a
pause
frank
wentworth
was
sufficiently
aware
after
his
first
start
of
indignation
that
he
had
no
right
to
interfere
as
mr
proctor
said
between
the
miss
wodehouses
and
their
interest
he
had
no
means
of
providing
for
them
of
setting
them
above
the
chances
of
fortune
he
reflected
bitterly
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
offer
a
home
to
lucy
and
through
her
to
her
sister
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
stand
by
silently
to
suffer
other
people
to
discuss
what
was
to
be
done
for
the
woman
whom
he
loved
and
whose
name
was
sacred
to
him
this
was
a
stretch
of
patience
of
which
he
was
not
capable
i
can
only
say
again
said
the
curate
that
i
think
this
discussion
has
gone
far
enough
whatever
matters
of
business
there
may
be
that
require
arrangement
had
better
be
settled
between
mr
brown
and
mr
waters
so
far
as
private
feeling
goes
never
fear
i
manage
it
said
jack
wentworth
as
well
as
a
dozen
lawyers
private
feeling
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
have
a
cigar
wodehouse
we
talk
it
over
as
we
walk
home
said
the
condescending
potentate
these
words
dispersed
the
assembly
which
no
longer
had
any
object
as
jack
wentworth
sauntered
out
his
faithful
follower
pressed
through
the
others
to
join
him
wodehouse
was
himself
again
he
gave
a
sulky
nod
to
the
curate
and
said
parson
i
do
owe
much
to
you
and
hastened
out
close
upon
the
heels
of
his
patron
and
leader
all
the
authorities
of
carlingford
the
virtuous
people
who
conferred
station
and
respectability
by
a
look
sank
into
utter
insignificance
in
presence
of
jack
his
admiring
follower
went
after
him
with
a
swell
of
pride
he
was
a
poor
enough
rogue
himself
hustled
and
abused
by
everybody
an
unsuccessful
and
shabby
vagabond
notwithstanding
his
new
fortune
but
jack
was
the
glorified
impersonation
of
cleverness
and
wickedness
and
triumph
to
wodehouse
he
grew
insolent
when
he
was
permitted
to
put
his
arm
through
that
of
his
hero
and
went
off
with
him
trying
to
copy
in
swagger
and
insolence
his
careless
step
and
ease
perhaps
jack
wentworth
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
as
he
emerged
from
the
gate
of
the
rectory
with
his
shabby
and
disreputable
companion
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
as
he
looked
back
and
saw
gerald
and
frank
coming
slowly
out
together
said
jack
to
himself
it
is
i
who
am
the
true
philanthropist
let
us
do
evil
that
good
may
come
notwithstanding
he
was
very
thankful
not
to
be
seen
by
his
father
who
had
wished
to
consult
him
as
a
man
of
the
world
and
had
shown
certain
yearnings
towards
him
which
to
infinite
surprise
awakened
responsive
feelings
in
his
own
unaccustomed
bosom
he
was
half
ashamed
of
this
secret
movement
of
natural
affection
which
certainly
nobody
else
suspected
but
it
was
with
a
sensation
of
relief
that
he
closed
the
rectory
gate
behind
him
without
having
encountered
the
keen
inquiring
suspicious
glances
of
the
squire
the
others
dispersed
according
to
their
pleasure
mr
waters
joining
the
party
while
mr
proctor
followed
jack
wentworth
and
wodehouse
to
the
door
with
naïve
natural
curiosity
when
the
excellent
man
recollected
that
he
was
listening
to
private
conversation
and
met
wodehouse
look
of
sulky
insolence
he
turned
back
again
much
fluttered
and
disturbed
he
had
an
interest
in
the
matter
though
the
two
in
whose
hands
it
now
lay
were
the
last
whom
he
would
have
chosen
as
confidants
and
to
do
him
justice
he
was
thinking
of
lucy
only
in
his
desire
to
hear
what
they
decided
upon
something
might
happen
to
me
he
said
to
himself
and
even
if
all
was
well
she
would
be
happier
not
to
be
wholly
dependent
upon
her
sister
with
which
reflection
mr
proctor
slowly
followed
the
others
into
the
gerald
and
frank
who
were
neither
of
them
disposed
for
society
went
away
together
they
had
enough
to
think
of
without
much
need
of
conversation
and
they
had
walked
down
grange
lane
before
either
spoke
then
it
was
frank
who
broke
the
silence
abruptly
with
a
question
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
in
which
they
had
been
engaged
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
said
frank
suddenly
it
was
just
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
graceful
spire
of
st
roque
and
perhaps
it
was
the
sight
of
his
own
church
which
roused
the
perpetual
curate
to
think
of
the
henceforth
aimless
life
of
his
brother
i
understand
how
you
are
to
give
up
your
work
even
i
did
not
forget
myself
said
gerald
every
man
who
can
distinguish
good
from
evil
has
a
right
to
advise
his
i
have
not
given
up
that
common
privilege
do
hope
it
frank
said
the
martyr
with
a
momentary
smile
if
i
could
but
understand
why
it
is
that
you
make
this
terrible
sacrifice
said
the
curate
no
i
do
want
to
argue
of
course
you
are
convinced
i
can
understand
the
wish
that
our
unfortunate
division
had
never
taken
place
but
i
ca
understand
the
sacrifice
of
a
man
life
and
work
nothing
is
perfect
in
this
world
but
at
least
to
do
something
in
it
to
be
good
for
something
and
with
your
faculties
gerald
cried
the
admiring
and
regretful
brother
can
abstract
right
in
an
institution
if
that
is
what
you
aim
at
be
worth
the
sacrifice
of
your
existence
your
power
of
influencing
your
this
mr
wentworth
said
being
specially
moved
by
the
circumstances
in
which
he
found
himself
for
under
any
other
conditions
such
sentiments
would
have
produced
the
warmest
opposition
in
his
anglican
bosom
but
he
was
so
far
sympathetic
that
he
could
be
tolerant
to
his
brother
who
had
gone
to
rome
i
know
what
you
mean
said
gerald
it
is
the
prevailing
theory
in
england
that
all
human
institutions
are
imperfect
my
dear
frank
i
want
a
church
which
is
not
a
human
institution
in
england
it
seems
to
be
the
rule
of
faith
that
every
man
may
believe
as
he
pleases
there
is
no
authority
either
to
decide
or
to
punish
if
you
can
foresee
what
that
may
lead
us
to
i
can
not
i
take
refuge
in
the
true
church
where
alone
there
is
certainty
where
said
the
convert
with
a
heightened
colour
and
a
breath
there
is
authority
clear
and
decisive
in
england
you
believe
what
you
will
and
the
result
will
be
one
that
i
at
least
fear
to
contemplate
in
rome
we
believe
what
we
must
said
gerald
he
said
the
words
slowly
bowing
his
head
more
than
once
with
determined
submission
as
if
bending
under
the
yoke
frank
it
is
salvation
said
the
new
catholic
with
the
emphasis
of
a
despairing
hope
and
for
the
first
time
frank
wentworth
perceived
what
it
was
which
had
driven
his
brother
to
rome
i
understand
you
now
said
the
perpetual
curate
it
is
because
there
is
no
room
for
our
conflicting
doctrines
and
latitude
of
belief
instead
of
a
church
happily
so
far
imperfect
that
a
man
can
put
his
life
to
the
best
account
in
it
without
absolutely
delivering
up
his
intellect
to
a
set
of
doctrines
you
seek
a
perfect
church
in
which
for
a
symmetrical
system
of
doctrine
you
lose
the
use
of
your
existence
mr
wentworth
uttered
this
opinion
with
all
the
more
vehemence
that
it
was
in
direct
opposition
to
his
own
habitual
ideas
but
even
his
veneration
for
his
mother
yielded
for
the
moment
to
his
strong
sense
of
his
brother
mistake
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
say
said
gerald
but
it
is
true
if
you
but
knew
the
consolation
after
years
of
struggling
among
the
problems
of
faith
to
find
one
self
at
last
upon
a
rock
of
authority
of
certainty
one
holds
in
one
hand
at
last
the
interpretation
of
the
enigma
said
gerald
he
looked
up
to
the
sky
as
he
spoke
and
breathed
into
the
serene
air
a
wistful
lingering
sigh
if
it
was
certainty
that
echoed
in
that
breath
of
unsatisfied
nature
the
sound
was
sadly
out
of
concord
with
the
sentiment
his
soul
notwithstanding
that
expression
of
serenity
was
still
as
wistful
as
the
night
have
you
the
interpretation
said
his
brother
and
frank
too
looked
up
into
the
pure
sky
above
with
its
stars
which
stretched
over
them
serene
and
silent
arching
over
the
town
that
lay
behind
and
of
which
nobody
knew
better
than
he
the
human
mysteries
and
wonderful
unanswerable
questions
the
heart
of
the
curate
ached
to
think
how
many
problems
lay
in
the
darkness
over
which
that
sky
stretched
silent
making
no
sign
there
were
the
sorrowful
of
the
earth
enduring
their
afflictions
lifting
up
pitiful
hands
demanding
of
god
in
their
bereavements
and
in
their
miseries
the
reason
why
there
were
all
the
inequalities
of
life
side
by
side
evermore
echoing
dumbly
the
same
awful
question
and
over
all
shone
the
calm
sky
which
gave
no
answer
have
you
the
interpretation
he
said
perhaps
you
can
reconcile
freewill
and
predestination
the
need
of
a
universal
atonement
and
the
existence
of
individual
virtue
but
these
are
not
to
me
the
most
difficult
questions
can
your
church
explain
why
one
man
is
happy
and
another
miserable
why
one
has
everything
and
abounds
and
the
other
loses
all
that
is
most
precious
in
life
my
sister
mary
for
example
said
the
curate
she
seems
to
bear
the
cross
for
our
family
her
children
die
and
yours
live
can
you
explain
to
her
why
i
have
heard
her
cry
out
to
god
to
know
the
reason
and
he
made
no
answer
tell
me
have
you
the
interpretation
cried
the
young
man
on
whom
the
hardness
of
his
own
position
was
pressing
at
the
moment
they
went
on
together
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
without
any
attempt
on
gerald
part
to
answer
you
accept
the
explanation
of
the
church
in
respect
to
doctrines
said
the
curate
after
that
pause
and
consent
that
her
authority
is
sufficient
and
that
your
perplexity
is
over
that
is
well
enough
so
far
as
it
goes
but
outside
lies
a
world
in
which
every
event
is
an
enigma
where
nothing
that
comes
offers
any
explanation
of
itself
where
god
does
not
show
himself
always
kind
but
by
times
awful
terrible
a
god
who
smites
and
does
not
spare
it
is
easy
to
make
a
harmonious
balance
of
doctrine
but
where
is
the
interpretation
of
life
the
young
priest
looked
back
on
his
memory
and
recalled
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
book
the
daily
problems
with
which
he
was
so
well
acquainted
as
for
gerald
he
bowed
his
head
a
little
with
a
kind
of
reverence
as
if
he
had
been
bowing
before
the
shrine
of
a
saint
i
have
had
a
happy
life
said
the
elder
brother
i
have
not
been
driven
to
ask
such
questions
for
myself
to
these
the
church
has
but
one
advice
to
offer
trust
god
we
say
so
in
england
said
frank
wentworth
it
is
the
grand
scope
of
our
teaching
trust
god
he
will
not
explain
himself
nor
can
we
attempt
it
when
it
is
certain
that
i
must
be
content
with
this
answer
for
all
the
sorrows
of
life
i
am
content
to
take
my
doctrines
on
the
same
terms
said
the
perpetual
curate
and
by
this
time
they
had
come
to
miss
wentworth
door
after
all
perhaps
it
was
not
gerald
except
so
far
as
he
was
carried
by
a
wonderful
force
of
human
sympathy
and
purity
of
soul
who
was
the
predestined
priest
of
the
family
as
he
went
up
to
his
own
room
a
momentary
spasm
of
doubt
came
upon
the
new
convert
whether
perhaps
he
was
making
a
sacrifice
of
his
life
for
a
mistake
he
hushed
the
thought
forcibly
as
it
rose
such
impulses
were
no
longer
to
be
listened
to
the
same
authority
which
made
faith
certain
decided
every
doubt
to
be
sin
chapter
xli
next
morning
the
curate
got
up
with
anticipations
which
were
far
from
cheerful
and
a
weary
sense
of
the
monotony
and
dulness
of
life
he
had
won
his
little
battle
it
was
true
but
the
very
victory
had
removed
that
excitement
which
answered
in
the
absence
of
happier
stimulations
to
keep
up
his
heart
and
courage
after
a
struggle
like
that
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
it
was
hard
to
come
again
into
the
peaceable
routine
without
any
particular
hope
to
enliven
or
happiness
to
cheer
it
which
was
all
he
had
at
present
to
look
for
in
his
life
and
it
was
harder
still
to
feel
the
necessity
of
being
silent
of
standing
apart
from
lucy
in
her
need
of
shutting
up
in
his
own
heart
the
longing
he
had
towards
her
and
refraining
himself
from
the
desperate
thought
of
uniting
his
genteel
beggary
to
hers
that
was
the
one
thing
which
must
not
be
thought
of
and
he
subdued
himself
with
an
impatient
sigh
and
could
not
but
wonder
as
he
went
whether
if
gerald
had
been
less
smoothly
guided
through
the
perplexing
paths
of
life
he
would
have
found
time
for
all
the
difficulties
which
had
driven
him
to
take
refuge
in
rome
it
was
with
this
sense
of
hopeless
restraint
and
incapacity
which
is
perhaps
of
all
sensations
the
most
humbling
that
he
went
and
found
lying
on
his
breakfast
table
the
first
thing
that
met
his
eye
the
note
which
lucy
wodehouse
had
written
to
him
on
the
previous
night
as
he
read
it
the
earth
somehow
turned
to
the
sun
the
dubious
light
brightened
in
the
skies
unawares
he
had
been
wondering
never
to
receive
any
token
of
sympathy
any
word
of
encouragement
from
those
for
whom
he
had
made
so
many
exertions
when
he
had
read
lucy
letter
the
aspect
of
affairs
changed
considerably
to
be
sure
nothing
that
she
had
said
or
could
say
made
any
difference
in
the
facts
of
the
case
but
the
curate
was
young
and
still
liable
to
those
changes
of
atmosphere
which
do
more
for
an
imaginative
mind
than
real
revolutions
he
read
the
letter
several
times
over
as
he
lingered
through
his
breakfast
making
on
the
whole
an
agreeable
meal
and
finding
himself
repossessed
of
his
ordinary
healthful
appetite
he
even
canvassed
the
signature
as
much
in
reading
as
lucy
had
done
in
writing
it
balancing
in
his
mind
the
maidenly
truly
yours
of
that
subscription
with
as
many
ingenious
renderings
of
its
possible
meaning
as
if
lucy
letter
had
been
articles
of
faith
truly
mine
he
said
to
himself
with
a
smile
which
indeed
meant
all
a
lover
could
require
and
then
paused
as
if
he
had
been
dr
lushington
or
lord
westbury
to
inquire
into
the
real
force
of
the
phrase
for
after
all
it
is
not
only
when
signing
the
articles
that
the
bond
and
pledge
of
subscription
means
more
than
is
intended
when
mr
wentworth
was
able
to
tear
himself
from
the
agreeable
casuistry
of
this
he
got
up
in
much
better
spirits
to
go
about
his
daily
business
first
of
all
he
had
to
see
his
father
and
ascertain
what
were
the
squire
intentions
and
how
long
he
meant
to
stay
in
carlingford
and
then
it
occurred
to
the
perpetual
curate
that
after
that
politeness
demanded
that
he
should
call
on
the
miss
wodehouses
who
had
or
at
least
one
of
them
expressed
so
frankly
their
confidence
in
him
he
could
not
but
call
to
thank
her
to
inquire
into
their
plans
perhaps
to
back
aunt
leonora
invitation
which
he
was
aware
had
been
gratefully
declined
with
these
ideas
in
his
mind
he
went
after
brushing
his
hat
very
carefully
and
casting
one
solicitous
glance
in
the
mirror
as
he
passed
which
presented
to
him
a
very
creditable
reflection
an
eidolon
in
perfect
clerical
apparel
without
any
rusty
suggestions
of
a
perpetual
curacy
yet
a
perpetual
curacy
it
was
which
was
his
sole
benefice
or
hope
in
his
present
circumstances
for
he
knew
very
well
that
were
all
other
objections
at
an
end
neither
skelmersdale
nor
wentworth
could
be
kept
open
for
him
and
that
beyond
these
two
he
had
not
a
hope
of
advancement
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
pledged
to
remain
in
carlingford
all
this
however
though
discouraging
enough
did
not
succeed
in
discouraging
mr
wentworth
after
he
had
read
lucy
letter
he
went
so
lightly
that
mrs
hadwin
who
was
waiting
in
the
parlour
in
her
best
cap
to
ask
if
he
would
pardon
her
for
making
such
a
mistake
did
not
hear
him
pass
and
sat
waiting
for
an
hour
forgetting
or
rather
neglecting
to
give
any
response
when
the
butcher
came
for
orders
which
was
an
unprecedented
accident
mr
wentworth
went
cheerfully
up
grange
lane
meeting
by
a
singular
chance
ever
so
many
people
who
stopped
to
shake
hands
with
him
or
at
least
bowed
their
good
wishes
and
friendly
acknowledgments
he
smiled
in
himself
at
these
evidences
of
popular
penitence
but
was
not
the
less
pleased
to
find
himself
reinstated
in
his
place
in
the
affections
and
respect
of
carlingford
after
all
it
was
not
an
unnatural
mistake
he
said
to
himself
and
smiled
benignly
upon
the
excellent
people
who
had
found
out
the
error
of
their
own
ways
carlingford
indeed
seemed
altogether
in
a
more
cheerful
state
than
usual
and
mr
wentworth
could
not
but
think
that
the
community
in
general
was
glad
to
find
that
it
had
been
deceived
and
so
went
upon
his
way
pleasing
himself
with
those
maxims
about
the
ultimate
prevalence
of
justice
and
truth
which
make
it
apparent
that
goodness
is
always
victorious
and
wickedness
punished
in
the
end
somehow
even
a
popular
fallacy
has
an
aspect
of
truth
when
it
suits
one
own
case
the
perpetual
curate
went
through
his
garden
with
a
conscious
smile
feeling
once
more
master
of
himself
and
his
concerns
there
was
to
tell
the
truth
even
a
slight
shade
of
and
approbation
upon
his
handsome
countenance
in
the
present
changed
state
of
public
opinion
and
private
feeling
he
began
to
take
some
pleasure
in
his
sacrifice
to
be
sure
a
perpetual
curate
could
not
marry
but
perhaps
lucy
in
short
there
was
no
telling
what
might
happen
and
it
was
accordingly
with
that
delicious
sense
of
goodness
which
generally
attends
an
act
of
mingled
with
an
equally
delicious
feeling
that
the
act
when
accomplished
might
turn
out
no
such
great
sacrifice
after
all
which
it
is
to
be
feared
is
the
most
usual
way
in
which
the
sacrifices
of
youth
are
made
that
the
curate
walked
into
the
hall
passing
his
aunt
dora
toy
terrier
without
that
violent
inclination
to
give
it
a
whack
with
his
cane
in
passing
which
was
his
usual
state
of
feeling
to
tell
the
truth
lucy
letter
had
made
him
at
peace
with
all
the
world
when
however
he
entered
the
where
the
family
were
still
at
breakfast
frank
serenity
was
unexpectedly
disturbed
the
first
thing
that
met
his
eyes
was
his
aunt
leonora
towering
over
her
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
holding
in
her
hand
a
letter
which
she
had
just
opened
the
envelope
had
fallen
in
the
midst
of
the
immaculate
breakfast
things
and
indeed
lay
with
its
broad
black
edge
on
the
top
of
the
lumps
in
miss
leonora
own
and
the
news
had
been
sufficiently
interesting
to
suspend
the
operations
of
and
to
bring
the
woman
to
her
feet
the
first
words
which
were
audible
to
frank
revealed
to
him
the
nature
of
the
intelligence
which
had
produced
such
startling
effects
he
was
always
a
contradictory
man
said
miss
leonora
since
the
first
hour
he
was
in
skelmersdale
he
has
made
a
practice
of
doing
things
at
the
wrong
time
i
do
mean
to
reproach
the
poor
man
now
he
gone
but
when
he
has
been
so
long
of
going
what
good
could
it
do
him
to
choose
this
particular
moment
for
no
other
reason
that
i
can
see
except
that
it
was
specially
uncomfortable
to
us
what
my
brother
has
just
been
saying
makes
it
all
the
worse
said
miss
leonora
with
a
look
of
annoyance
she
had
turned
her
head
away
from
the
door
which
was
at
the
side
of
the
room
and
had
not
perceived
the
entrance
of
the
curate
as
long
as
we
could
imagine
that
frank
was
to
succeed
to
the
rectory
the
thing
looked
comparatively
easy
i
beg
your
pardon
gerald
of
course
you
know
how
grieved
i
am
in
short
that
we
all
feel
the
deepest
distress
and
vexation
but
to
be
sure
since
you
have
given
it
up
somebody
must
succeed
you
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
not
the
least
my
dear
aunt
said
gerald
i
am
glad
you
grant
so
much
it
is
well
to
be
sure
of
something
said
the
incisive
and
peremptory
speaker
it
would
have
been
a
painful
thing
for
us
at
any
time
to
place
another
person
in
skelmersdale
while
frank
was
unprovided
for
but
of
course
said
miss
leonora
sitting
down
suddenly
nobody
who
knows
me
could
suppose
for
a
minute
that
i
would
let
my
feelings
stand
in
the
way
of
my
public
duty
still
it
is
very
awkward
just
at
this
moment
when
frank
on
the
whole
has
been
behaving
very
properly
and
one
ca
help
so
far
approving
of
him
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
aunt
leonora
said
the
curate
oh
you
are
there
frank
said
his
sensible
aunt
and
though
she
was
a
slight
shade
of
additional
colour
appeared
for
a
moment
on
miss
leonora
face
she
paused
a
little
evidently
diverted
from
the
line
of
discourse
which
she
had
contemplated
and
wavered
like
a
vessel
disturbed
in
its
course
the
fact
is
i
have
just
had
a
letter
announcing
mr
shirley
death
she
continued
facing
round
towards
her
nephew
and
setting
off
abruptly
in
face
of
all
consequences
on
the
new
tack
i
am
very
sorry
said
frank
wentworth
though
i
have
an
old
grudge
at
him
on
account
of
his
long
sermons
but
as
you
have
expected
it
for
a
year
or
two
i
ca
imagine
your
grief
to
be
overwhelming
said
the
curate
with
a
touch
of
natural
impertinence
to
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
skelmersdale
had
been
so
long
thought
interesting
to
him
that
now
when
it
was
not
in
the
least
interesting
he
got
impatient
of
the
name
i
quite
agree
with
you
frank
said
miss
wentworth
aunt
cecilia
had
not
been
able
for
a
long
time
to
agree
with
anybody
she
had
been
on
the
contrary
shaking
her
head
and
shedding
a
few
gentle
tears
over
gerald
silent
submission
and
louisa
noisy
lamentations
everything
was
somehow
going
wrong
and
she
who
had
no
power
to
mend
at
least
could
not
assent
and
broke
through
her
old
use
and
wont
to
shake
her
head
which
was
a
thing
very
alarming
to
the
family
the
entire
party
was
moved
by
a
sensation
of
pleasure
to
hear
miss
cecilia
say
i
quite
agree
with
you
frank
you
are
looking
better
this
morning
my
dear
aunt
said
gerald
they
had
a
great
respect
for
each
other
these
two
but
when
miss
cecilia
turned
to
hear
what
her
elder
nephew
was
saying
her
face
lost
the
momentary
look
of
approval
it
had
worn
and
she
again
though
very
softly
almost
imperceptibly
began
to
shake
her
head
we
were
not
asking
for
your
sympathy
said
miss
leonora
sharply
do
talk
like
a
saucy
boy
we
were
talking
of
our
own
embarrassment
there
is
a
very
excellent
young
man
the
curate
of
the
parish
whom
julia
trench
is
to
be
married
to
by
the
way
of
course
this
must
put
it
off
but
i
was
about
to
say
when
you
interrupted
me
that
to
give
it
away
from
you
at
this
moment
just
as
you
had
been
doing
well
doing
your
duty
said
miss
leonora
with
unusual
hesitation
was
certainly
very
uncomfortable
to
say
the
least
to
us
do
let
that
have
the
slightest
influence
on
you
i
beg
cried
the
perpetual
curate
with
all
the
pride
of
his
years
i
hope
i
have
been
doing
my
duty
all
along
the
young
man
added
more
softly
a
moment
after
upon
which
the
squire
gave
a
little
nod
partly
of
satisfaction
and
encouragement
to
his
son
partly
of
remonstrance
and
protest
to
his
sister
yes
i
suppose
so
with
the
flowers
at
easter
for
example
said
miss
leonora
with
a
slight
sneer
i
consider
that
i
have
stood
by
you
through
all
this
business
frank
but
of
course
in
so
important
a
matter
as
a
cure
of
souls
neither
relationship
nor
to
a
certain
extent
approval
said
miss
leonora
with
again
some
hesitation
can
be
allowed
to
stand
against
public
duty
we
have
the
responsibility
of
providing
a
good
gospel
minister
i
beg
your
pardon
for
interrupting
you
leonora
said
the
squire
but
i
ca
help
thinking
that
you
make
a
mistake
i
think
it
a
man
bounden
duty
when
there
is
a
living
in
the
family
to
educate
one
of
his
sons
for
it
in
my
opinion
it
one
of
the
duties
of
property
you
have
no
right
to
live
off
your
estate
and
spend
your
money
elsewhere
and
no
more
have
you
any
right
to
give
less
than
than
your
own
flesh
and
blood
to
the
people
you
have
the
charge
of
you
got
the
charge
of
them
to
to
a
certain
extent
soul
and
body
sir
said
the
squire
growing
warm
as
he
put
down
his
and
forgetting
that
he
addressed
a
lady
i
never
have
any
peace
of
mind
if
i
filled
up
a
family
living
with
a
stranger
unless
of
course
mr
wentworth
added
in
a
parenthesis
an
unlikely
sort
of
contingency
which
had
not
occurred
to
him
at
first
you
should
happen
to
have
no
second
the
eldest
the
squire
the
second
the
rector
that
my
idea
leonora
of
church
and
state
miss
leonora
smiled
a
little
at
her
brother
ideas
i
have
long
known
that
we
were
not
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
said
the
aunt
who
though
cleverer
than
her
brother
was
too
wise
in
her
own
conceit
to
perceive
at
the
first
glance
the
noble
simple
conception
of
his
own
duties
and
position
which
was
implied
in
the
honest
gentleman
words
your
second
son
might
be
either
a
fool
or
a
knave
or
even
although
neither
might
be
quite
unfit
to
be
intrusted
with
the
eternal
interests
of
his
in
my
opinion
the
duty
of
choosing
a
clergyman
is
one
not
to
be
exercised
without
the
gravest
deliberation
a
conscientious
man
would
make
his
selection
dependent
at
least
upon
the
character
of
his
second
son
if
he
had
one
we
however
but
then
his
character
is
satisfactory
leonora
cried
miss
dora
feeling
emboldened
by
the
shadow
of
visitors
under
whose
shield
she
could
always
retire
everybody
knows
what
a
good
clergyman
he
is
i
am
sure
it
would
be
like
a
new
world
in
skelmersdale
if
you
were
there
frank
my
dear
and
he
preaches
such
beautiful
sermons
said
the
unlucky
little
woman
upon
whom
her
sister
immediately
descended
swift
and
sudden
like
a
storm
at
sea
we
are
generally
perfectly
of
accord
in
our
conclusions
said
miss
leonora
as
for
dora
she
comes
to
the
same
end
by
a
roundabout
way
after
what
my
brother
has
been
saying
yes
said
the
squire
with
uncomfortable
looks
i
was
saying
to
your
aunt
frank
what
i
said
to
you
about
poor
mary
since
gerald
go
and
since
you
do
want
to
come
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
have
huxtable
he
a
very
good
fellow
on
the
whole
and
it
might
cheer
her
up
poor
soul
to
be
near
her
sisters
life
has
been
hard
work
to
her
poor
girl
very
hard
work
sir
said
the
squire
with
a
sigh
the
idea
was
troublesome
and
uncomfortable
and
always
disturbed
his
mind
when
it
occurred
to
him
it
was
indeed
a
secret
humiliation
to
the
squire
that
his
eldest
daughter
possessed
so
little
the
characteristic
health
and
prosperity
of
the
wentworths
he
was
very
sorry
for
her
but
yet
half
angry
and
half
ashamed
as
if
she
could
have
helped
it
but
however
he
had
been
obliged
to
admit
in
his
private
deliberations
on
the
subject
that
failing
frank
mary
husband
had
the
next
best
right
to
wentworth
rectory
an
arrangement
of
which
miss
leonora
did
not
approve
i
was
about
to
say
that
we
have
no
second
son
she
said
taking
up
the
thread
of
her
discourse
where
it
had
been
interrupted
our
duty
is
solely
towards
the
christian
people
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
infallible
said
miss
leonora
with
a
meek
air
of
but
i
should
be
a
very
poor
creature
indeed
if
at
my
age
i
did
not
know
what
i
believed
and
was
not
perfectly
convinced
that
i
am
right
consequently
though
i
repeat
mr
shirley
has
chosen
the
most
inconvenient
moment
possible
for
dying
it
ca
be
expected
of
me
that
i
should
appoint
my
nephew
whose
opinions
in
most
points
are
exactly
the
opposite
of
mine
i
wish
at
least
you
would
believe
what
i
say
interrupted
the
curate
impatiently
there
might
have
been
some
sense
in
all
this
three
months
ago
but
if
skelmersdale
were
the
to
everything
desirable
in
the
church
you
are
all
quite
aware
that
i
could
not
accept
it
stop
gerald
i
am
not
so
disinterested
as
you
think
said
frank
if
i
left
carlingford
now
people
would
remember
against
me
that
my
character
had
been
called
in
question
here
i
can
remain
a
perpetual
curate
said
the
young
man
with
a
smile
but
i
tolerate
any
shadow
upon
my
honour
i
am
sorry
i
came
in
at
such
an
awkward
moment
good
morning
aunt
leonora
i
hope
julia
trench
when
she
has
the
rectory
will
always
keep
of
your
way
of
thinking
she
used
to
incline
a
little
to
mine
he
said
mischievously
as
he
went
away
come
back
frank
presently
said
the
squire
whose
attention
had
been
distracted
from
his
mr
wentworth
began
to
be
tired
of
such
a
succession
of
exciting
discussions
he
thought
if
he
had
frank
quietly
to
himself
he
could
settle
matters
much
more
agreeably
but
the
was
certainly
an
accompaniment
more
tranquillising
so
far
as
a
comfortable
meal
was
concerned
he
ca
come
back
presently
said
aunt
leonora
you
speak
as
if
he
had
nothing
to
do
when
on
the
contrary
he
has
everything
to
do
that
is
worth
doing
said
that
contradictory
authority
come
back
to
lunch
frank
and
i
wish
you
would
eat
your
breakfast
dora
and
not
stare
at
me
miss
dora
had
come
down
to
breakfast
as
an
invalid
in
a
pretty
little
cap
with
a
shawl
over
her
she
had
not
yet
got
over
her
adventure
and
the
excitement
of
rosa
capture
that
unusual
accident
and
all
the
applauses
of
her
courage
which
had
been
addressed
to
her
since
had
roused
the
timid
woman
she
did
not
withdraw
her
eyes
from
her
sister
though
commanded
to
do
so
on
the
contrary
her
look
grew
more
and
more
emphatic
she
meant
to
have
made
a
solemn
address
throwing
off
leonora
yoke
and
declaring
her
intention
in
this
grave
crisis
of
her
nephew
fortunes
of
acting
for
herself
but
her
feelings
were
too
much
for
miss
dora
the
tears
came
creeping
to
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
she
could
not
keep
them
back
and
her
attempt
at
dignity
broke
down
i
am
never
consulted
she
said
with
a
gasp
i
do
mean
to
pretend
to
know
better
than
leonora
but
but
i
think
it
is
very
hard
that
frank
should
be
disappointed
about
skelmersdale
you
may
call
me
as
foolish
as
you
please
said
miss
dora
with
rising
tears
i
know
everybody
will
say
it
is
my
fault
but
i
must
say
i
think
it
is
very
hard
that
frank
should
be
disappointed
he
was
always
brought
up
for
it
as
everybody
knows
and
to
disappoint
him
who
is
so
good
and
so
nice
for
a
fat
young
man
buttered
all
over
like
like
a
cried
poor
miss
dora
severely
adhering
to
the
unity
of
her
desperate
metaphor
i
do
know
what
julia
trench
can
be
thinking
of
i
i
know
what
leonora
means
i
am
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
said
aunt
cecilia
setting
down
with
a
little
gentle
emphasis
her
cup
of
tea
here
was
rebellion
open
and
uncompromised
miss
leonora
was
so
much
taken
by
surprise
that
she
lifted
the
out
of
the
way
and
stared
at
her
interlocutors
with
genuine
amazement
but
she
proved
herself
as
usual
equal
to
the
occasion
it
unfortunate
that
we
never
see
eye
to
eye
just
at
once
she
said
with
a
look
which
expressed
more
distinctly
than
words
could
have
done
the
preliminary
flourish
of
his
whip
by
means
of
which
a
skilful
charioteer
gets
his
team
under
hand
without
touching
them
but
it
is
very
lucky
that
we
always
come
to
agree
in
the
end
she
added
more
significantly
still
it
was
well
to
crush
insubordination
in
the
bud
not
that
she
did
not
share
the
sentiment
of
her
sisters
but
then
they
were
guided
like
ordinary
women
by
their
feelings
whereas
miss
leonora
had
the
rights
of
property
before
her
and
the
approval
of
exeter
hall
and
he
wants
to
marry
poor
dear
boy
said
miss
dora
pale
with
fright
yet
persevering
and
she
is
a
dear
good
girl
the
very
person
for
a
clergyman
wife
and
what
is
he
to
do
if
he
is
always
to
be
curate
of
st
roque
you
may
say
it
is
my
fault
but
i
can
not
help
it
he
always
used
to
come
to
me
in
all
his
little
troubles
and
when
he
wants
anything
very
particular
he
knows
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
him
sobbed
the
proud
aunt
who
could
not
help
recollecting
how
much
use
she
had
been
to
frank
she
wiped
her
eyes
at
the
thought
and
held
up
her
head
with
a
thrill
of
pride
and
satisfaction
nobody
could
blame
her
in
that
particular
at
least
he
knew
he
had
only
to
tell
me
what
he
wanted
said
miss
dora
swelling
out
her
innocent
plumes
jack
who
was
sitting
opposite
and
who
had
been
listening
with
admiration
thought
it
time
to
come
in
on
his
own
part
i
hope
you
do
mean
to
forsake
aunt
dora
he
said
if
a
poor
fellow
can
not
have
faith
in
his
aunt
whom
can
he
have
faith
in
i
thought
it
was
too
good
to
last
said
the
neglected
prodigal
you
have
left
the
poor
sheep
in
the
wilderness
and
gone
back
to
the
righteous
men
who
need
no
repentance
he
put
up
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
and
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
look
with
laughter
in
his
face
at
his
brother
gerald
as
for
the
squire
he
was
startled
to
hear
his
eldest
son
quoting
scripture
and
laid
aside
his
paper
once
more
to
know
what
it
meant
i
am
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
jack
said
aunt
dora
suddenly
stopping
short
and
feeling
guilty
i
never
meant
to
neglect
you
poor
dear
boy
he
never
was
properly
tried
with
female
society
and
the
comforts
of
home
but
then
you
were
dining
out
that
night
said
the
simple
woman
eagerly
i
should
have
stayed
with
you
jack
had
you
been
at
home
from
this
little
scene
miss
leonora
turned
away
hastily
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
she
made
an
abrupt
end
of
her
and
went
off
to
her
little
with
a
grim
smile
upon
her
countenance
she
too
had
been
taken
in
a
little
by
pleasant
farce
of
the
sinner
repentant
and
it
occurred
to
her
to
feel
a
little
ashamed
of
herself
as
she
went
after
all
the
just
men
of
jack
irreverent
quotation
were
worth
considering
now
and
then
and
miss
leonora
could
not
but
think
with
a
little
humiliation
of
the
contrast
between
her
nephew
frank
and
the
comfortable
young
curate
who
was
going
to
marry
julia
trench
he
fat
it
could
not
be
denied
and
she
remembered
his
chubby
looks
and
his
sermons
about
and
mortification
of
the
flesh
much
as
a
pious
catholic
might
think
of
the
lenten
oratory
of
a
fat
friar
but
then
he
was
perfectly
sound
in
his
doctrines
and
it
was
undeniable
that
the
people
liked
him
and
that
the
appointment
was
one
which
even
a
scotch
ecclesiastical
community
full
of
popular
rights
could
scarcely
have
objected
to
according
to
her
own
principles
the
woman
could
not
do
otherwise
she
threw
herself
into
her
with
unnecessary
force
and
read
over
the
letter
which
miss
trench
herself
had
written
it
is
difficult
to
think
of
any
consolation
in
such
a
bereavement
wrote
mr
shirley
niece
but
still
it
is
a
little
comfort
to
feel
that
i
can
throw
myself
on
your
sympathy
my
dear
and
kind
friend
little
calculating
thing
miss
leonora
said
to
herself
as
she
threw
down
the
mournful
epistle
and
then
she
could
not
help
thinking
again
of
frank
to
be
sure
he
was
not
of
her
way
of
thinking
but
when
she
remembered
the
investigation
and
its
result
and
the
secret
romance
involved
in
it
her
wentworth
blood
sent
a
thrill
of
pride
and
pleasure
through
her
veins
miss
leonora
though
she
was
was
still
woman
enough
to
perceive
her
nephew
motives
in
his
benevolence
to
wodehouse
but
these
motives
which
were
strong
enough
to
make
him
endure
so
much
annoyance
were
not
strong
enough
to
tempt
him
from
carlingford
and
his
perpetual
curacy
where
his
honour
and
reputation
in
the
face
of
love
and
ambition
demanded
that
he
should
remain
it
would
be
a
pity
to
balk
him
in
his
she
said
to
herself
with
again
a
somewhat
grim
smile
and
a
comparison
not
much
to
the
advantage
of
julia
trench
and
curate
she
shut
herself
up
among
her
papers
till
luncheon
and
only
emerged
with
a
stormy
front
when
that
meal
was
on
the
table
during
the
progress
of
which
she
snubbed
everybody
who
ventured
to
speak
to
her
and
spoke
to
her
nephew
frank
as
if
he
might
have
been
suspected
of
designs
upon
the
such
were
the
unpleasant
consequences
of
the
struggle
between
duty
and
inclination
in
the
bosom
of
miss
leonora
and
save
for
other
unforeseen
events
which
decided
the
matter
for
her
it
is
not
by
any
means
so
certain
as
judging
from
her
character
it
ought
to
have
been
that
duty
would
have
won
the
day
chapter
xlii
frank
wentworth
once
more
went
up
grange
lane
a
thoughtful
and
a
sober
man
exhilaration
comes
but
by
moments
in
the
happiest
of
lives
and
already
he
began
to
remember
how
very
little
he
had
to
be
elated
about
and
how
entirely
things
remained
as
before
even
lucy
her
letter
very
probably
might
be
only
an
effusion
of
friendship
and
at
all
events
what
could
he
say
to
her
what
did
he
dare
in
honour
say
and
then
his
mind
went
off
to
think
of
the
two
rectories
between
which
he
had
fallen
as
between
two
stools
though
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
accept
neither
he
did
not
the
less
feel
a
certain
mortification
in
seeing
that
his
relations
on
both
sides
were
so
willing
to
bestow
their
gifts
elsewhere
he
could
not
tolerate
the
idea
of
succeeding
gerald
in
his
own
person
but
still
he
found
it
very
disagreeable
to
consent
to
the
thought
that
huxtable
should
replace
him
huxtable
who
was
a
good
fellow
enough
but
of
whom
frank
wentworth
thought
as
men
generally
think
of
their
with
a
wonder
what
mary
could
ever
have
seen
in
so
commonplace
a
man
to
think
of
him
as
rector
of
wentworth
inwardly
chafed
the
spirit
of
the
perpetual
curate
as
he
was
going
along
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
did
not
perceive
how
his
approach
was
watched
for
from
the
other
side
of
the
way
by
elsworthy
who
stood
with
his
bundle
of
newspapers
under
his
arm
and
his
hat
in
his
hand
watching
for
his
clergyman
with
submission
and
apology
on
the
surface
and
hidden
rancour
underneath
elsworthy
was
not
penitent
he
was
furious
and
disappointed
his
mistake
and
its
consequences
were
wholly
humiliating
and
had
not
in
them
a
single
saving
feature
to
atone
for
the
wounds
of
his
the
curate
had
not
only
baffled
and
beaten
him
but
humbled
him
in
his
own
eyes
which
is
perhaps
of
all
others
the
injury
least
easy
to
forgive
it
was
however
with
an
appearance
of
the
profoundest
submission
that
he
stood
awaiting
the
approach
of
the
man
he
had
tried
so
much
to
injure
mr
wentworth
sir
said
elsworthy
if
i
was
worth
your
while
i
might
think
as
you
were
offended
with
me
but
seeing
i
one
as
is
so
far
beneath
you
he
went
on
with
a
kind
of
grin
intended
to
represent
a
deprecatory
smile
but
which
would
have
been
a
snarl
had
he
dared
i
ca
think
as
you
bear
no
malice
may
i
ask
sir
if
there
to
be
any
difference
made
in
what
respect
elsworthy
said
the
curate
shortly
well
sir
i
ca
tell
said
the
clerk
of
st
roque
if
a
clergyman
was
to
bear
malice
it
in
his
power
to
make
things
very
unpleasant
i
do
speak
of
the
place
at
church
which
aint
either
here
nor
there
it
respectable
but
it
aint
lucrative
but
if
you
was
to
stretch
a
point
mr
wentworth
by
continuing
the
papers
and
suchlike
it
aint
that
i
value
the
money
said
elsworthy
but
been
a
faithful
servant
and
i
might
say
if
you
was
to
take
it
in
a
right
spirit
an
friend
mr
wentworth
he
continued
after
a
little
pause
growing
bolder
and
now
as
i
that
unfortunate
creature
to
provide
for
and
no
one
knowing
what
to
become
of
her
i
wonder
that
you
venture
to
speak
of
her
to
me
said
the
curate
with
a
little
indignation
after
all
the
warnings
i
gave
you
but
you
ought
to
consider
that
you
are
to
blame
a
great
deal
more
than
she
is
she
is
only
a
child
if
you
had
taken
better
care
of
her
but
you
would
not
pay
any
attention
to
my
warning
you
must
bear
the
consequences
as
you
best
can
well
sir
said
elsworthy
if
you
to
bear
malice
i
have
got
nothing
to
say
but
there
aint
ten
men
in
carlingford
as
would
agree
with
me
that
when
a
young
gentleman
even
if
he
is
a
clergyman
takes
particklar
notice
of
a
pretty
young
girl
it
aint
just
for
nothing
as
he
does
it
not
to
say
watching
over
her
paternal
to
see
as
she
was
out
late
at
night
and
suchlike
but
bygones
is
bygones
sir
said
elsworthy
and
is
never
more
to
be
mentioned
by
me
i
do
ask
no
more
if
you
but
do
the
same
you
wo
ask
no
more
said
the
curate
angrily
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
of
you
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
elsworthy
go
and
look
after
your
business
i
will
attend
to
mine
and
when
we
are
not
forced
to
meet
let
us
keep
clear
of
each
other
it
will
be
better
both
for
you
and
me
the
curate
passed
on
with
an
impatient
nod
but
his
assailant
did
not
intend
that
he
should
escape
so
easily
i
should
have
thought
sir
as
you
have
borne
malice
said
elsworthy
hastening
on
after
him
yet
keeping
half
a
step
behind
i
a
humbled
man
different
from
what
i
ever
thought
to
be
i
could
always
keep
up
my
head
afore
the
world
till
now
and
if
it
aint
your
fault
sir
as
i
humbly
beg
your
pardon
for
ever
being
so
far
led
away
as
to
believe
it
was
all
the
same
it
along
of
you
what
do
you
mean
said
the
curate
who
half
amused
and
half
indignant
at
the
change
of
tone
had
slackened
his
pace
to
listen
to
this
new
accusation
what
i
mean
sir
is
that
if
you
had
been
so
good
and
so
as
to
take
into
your
house
the
the
villain
as
has
done
it
all
him
and
rosa
could
never
have
known
each
other
i
allow
as
it
was
nothing
but
your
own
goodness
as
did
it
but
it
was
a
black
day
for
me
and
mine
said
the
dramatist
with
a
pathetic
turn
of
voice
not
as
i
casting
no
blame
on
you
as
is
well
known
to
be
never
mind
what
i
well
known
to
be
said
the
curate
the
other
day
you
thought
was
the
villain
if
you
can
tell
me
anything
you
want
me
to
do
i
will
understand
that
but
i
am
not
desirous
to
know
your
opinion
of
me
said
the
careless
young
man
as
he
stood
listening
impatiently
pausing
a
second
time
dr
marjoribanks
came
out
to
his
door
and
stepped
into
his
brougham
to
go
off
to
his
morning
round
of
visits
the
doctor
took
off
his
hat
when
he
saw
the
curate
and
waved
it
to
him
cheerfully
with
a
gesture
of
congratulation
dr
marjoribanks
was
quite
stanch
and
honest
and
would
have
manfully
stood
by
his
intimates
in
dangerous
circumstances
but
somehow
he
preferred
success
it
was
pleasanter
to
be
able
to
congratulate
people
than
to
condole
with
them
he
preferred
it
and
nobody
could
object
to
so
orthodox
a
sentiment
most
probably
if
mr
wentworth
had
still
been
in
partial
disgrace
the
doctor
would
not
have
seen
him
in
his
easy
glance
down
the
road
but
though
mr
wentworth
was
aware
of
that
the
mute
congratulation
had
yet
its
effect
upon
him
he
was
moved
by
that
delicate
symptom
of
how
the
wind
was
blowing
in
carlingford
and
forgot
all
about
elsworthy
though
the
man
was
standing
by
his
side
as
you
so
good
as
to
take
it
kind
sir
said
the
clerk
of
st
roque
and
as
i
was
it
well
known
as
you
always
ready
to
hear
a
poor
man
tale
perhaps
you
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
not
make
no
difference
that
was
all
mr
wentworth
he
continued
eagerly
as
the
curate
gave
an
impatient
nod
and
turned
to
go
on
i
heard
as
this
villain
is
rich
sir
by
means
of
robbing
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
but
it
aint
for
me
to
trust
to
what
folks
says
after
the
experience
i
had
and
never
can
forgive
myself
for
being
led
away
said
elsworthy
it
well
known
in
carlingford
for
heaven
sake
come
to
the
point
and
be
done
with
it
said
the
curate
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
sir
said
elsworthy
solemnly
you
a
real
gentleman
and
you
do
bear
no
malice
for
what
was
a
mistake
and
you
aint
one
to
turn
your
back
on
an
unfortunate
family
and
mr
wentworth
sir
you
aint
to
stand
by
and
see
me
and
mine
wronged
as
have
always
wished
you
well
if
we
ca
get
justice
of
him
we
can
get
damages
cried
elsworthy
he
aint
to
be
let
off
as
if
he
done
no
harm
and
seeing
as
it
was
along
of
you
hold
your
tongue
sir
cried
the
curate
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
keep
out
of
my
way
or
at
least
learn
to
restrain
your
tongue
no
more
not
a
word
more
said
the
young
man
indignantly
he
went
off
with
such
a
sweep
and
wind
of
anger
and
annoyance
that
the
slower
and
older
complainant
had
no
chance
to
follow
him
elsworthy
accordingly
went
off
to
the
shop
where
his
were
waiting
for
the
newspapers
and
where
rosa
lay
weeping
in
a
dark
room
where
her
enraged
aunt
had
shut
her
up
mrs
elsworthy
had
shut
up
the
poor
little
pretty
wretch
who
might
have
been
penitent
under
better
guidance
but
who
by
this
time
had
lost
what
sense
of
shame
and
wrong
her
childish
conscience
was
capable
of
in
the
stronger
present
sense
of
injury
and
resentment
and
longing
to
escape
but
the
angry
aunt
though
she
could
turn
the
key
on
poor
rosa
unfortunate
little
person
could
not
shut
in
the
piteous
sobs
which
now
and
then
sounded
through
and
through
the
house
and
which
converted
all
the
without
exception
into
indignant
partisans
of
rosa
and
even
moved
the
heart
of
peter
hayles
who
could
hear
them
at
the
back
window
where
he
was
making
up
dr
marjoribanks
prescriptions
as
the
sense
of
injury
waxed
stronger
and
stronger
in
rosa
bosom
she
availed
herself
like
any
other
irrational
irresponsible
creature
of
such
means
of
revenging
herself
and
annoying
her
keepers
as
occurred
to
her
nobody
ever
took
no
care
of
me
sobbed
rosa
i
never
had
no
father
or
mother
oh
i
wish
i
was
dead
and
nobody
would
care
these
utterances
it
may
be
imagined
went
to
the
very
heart
of
the
who
were
collected
in
a
circle
plotting
how
to
release
rosa
when
elsworthy
mortified
and
furious
came
back
from
his
unsuccessful
assault
on
the
curate
they
scattered
like
a
covey
of
little
birds
before
the
angry
man
who
tossed
their
papers
at
them
and
then
strode
up
the
echoing
stairs
if
you
do
hold
your
d
d
tongue
said
elsworthy
knocking
furiously
at
rosa
door
i
turn
you
to
the
door
this
instant
i
will
by
nobody
in
carlingford
had
ever
before
heard
an
oath
issue
from
the
respectable
lips
of
the
clerk
of
st
roque
when
he
went
down
into
the
shop
again
the
outcries
sank
into
frightened
moans
not
much
wonder
that
the
entire
neighbourhood
became
as
indignant
with
elsworthy
as
it
ever
had
been
with
the
perpetual
curate
the
husband
and
wife
took
up
their
positions
in
the
shop
after
this
as
far
apart
as
was
possible
from
each
other
both
resenting
in
silent
fury
the
wrong
which
the
world
in
general
had
done
them
if
mrs
elsworthy
had
dared
she
would
have
exhausted
her
passion
in
abuse
of
everybody
of
the
curate
for
not
being
guilty
of
her
husband
for
supposing
him
to
be
so
and
to
be
sure
of
rosa
herself
who
was
the
cause
of
all
but
elsworthy
was
dangerous
not
to
be
approached
or
spoken
to
he
went
out
about
noon
to
see
john
brown
and
discuss
with
him
the
question
of
damages
but
the
occurrences
which
took
place
in
his
absence
are
not
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
present
narrative
which
concerns
mr
frank
wentworth
visit
to
lucy
wodehouse
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
ignoble
hates
or
loves
the
curate
went
rapidly
on
to
the
green
door
which
once
more
looked
like
a
gate
of
paradise
he
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
he
was
going
to
do
or
say
he
was
only
conscious
of
a
state
of
exaltation
a
condition
of
mind
which
might
precede
great
happiness
or
great
misery
but
had
nothing
in
it
of
the
common
state
of
affairs
in
which
people
ask
each
other
how
do
you
do
notwithstanding
the
fact
is
that
when
lucy
entered
that
dear
familiar
where
every
feature
and
individual
expression
of
every
piece
of
furniture
was
as
well
known
to
him
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
human
faces
it
was
only
how
do
you
do
that
the
curate
found
himself
able
to
say
the
two
shook
hands
as
demurely
as
if
lucy
had
indeed
been
according
to
the
deceptive
representation
of
yesterday
as
old
as
aunt
dora
and
then
she
seated
herself
in
her
favourite
chair
and
tried
to
begin
a
little
conversation
about
things
in
general
even
in
these
three
days
nature
and
youth
had
done
something
for
lucy
she
had
slept
and
rested
and
the
unforeseen
misfortune
which
had
come
in
to
distract
her
grief
had
roused
all
the
natural
strength
that
was
in
her
as
she
was
a
little
nervous
about
this
interview
not
knowing
what
it
might
end
in
lucy
thought
it
her
duty
to
be
as
composed
and
as
possible
and
in
order
to
avoid
all
dangerous
and
exciting
subjects
began
to
talk
of
wharfside
i
have
not
heard
anything
for
three
or
four
days
about
the
poor
woman
at
no
she
said
i
meant
to
have
gone
to
see
her
but
somehow
one
gets
so
selfish
when
when
one
mind
is
full
of
affairs
of
one
own
yes
said
the
curate
and
speaking
of
that
i
wanted
to
tell
you
how
much
comfort
your
letter
had
been
to
me
my
head
too
has
been
very
full
of
affairs
of
my
own
i
thought
at
one
time
that
my
friends
were
forsaking
me
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
write
as
you
did
upon
which
there
followed
another
little
pause
indeed
the
goodness
was
all
on
your
side
said
lucy
faltering
if
i
had
ever
dreamt
how
much
you
were
doing
for
us
but
it
all
came
upon
me
so
suddenly
it
is
impossible
ever
to
express
in
words
of
the
gratitude
we
owe
you
she
said
with
restrained
enthusiasm
she
looked
up
at
him
as
she
spoke
with
a
little
glow
of
natural
fervour
which
brought
the
colour
to
her
cheek
and
the
moisture
to
her
eyes
she
was
not
of
the
disposition
to
give
either
thanks
or
confidence
by
halves
and
even
the
slight
not
unpleasant
sense
of
danger
which
gave
piquancy
to
this
interview
made
her
resolute
to
express
herself
fully
she
would
not
suffer
herself
to
stint
her
gratitude
because
of
the
sweet
suspicion
which
would
not
be
quite
silenced
that
possibly
mr
wentworth
looked
for
something
better
than
gratitude
not
for
any
consequences
however
much
they
might
be
to
be
avoided
could
she
be
shabby
enough
to
refrain
from
due
acknowledgment
of
devotion
so
great
therefore
while
the
perpetual
curate
was
doing
all
he
could
to
remind
himself
of
his
condition
and
to
persuade
himself
that
it
would
be
utterly
wrong
and
mean
of
him
to
speak
lucy
looked
up
at
him
looked
him
in
the
face
with
her
blue
eyes
shining
dewy
and
sweet
through
tears
of
gratitude
and
a
kind
of
generous
admiration
for
like
every
other
woman
she
felt
herself
exalted
and
filled
with
a
delicious
pride
in
seeing
that
the
man
of
her
unconscious
choice
had
proved
himself
the
best
the
curate
walked
to
the
window
very
much
as
mr
proctor
had
done
in
the
tumult
and
confusion
of
his
heart
and
came
back
again
with
what
he
had
to
say
written
clear
on
his
face
without
any
possibility
of
mistake
i
must
speak
said
the
young
man
i
have
no
right
to
speak
i
know
if
i
had
attained
the
height
of
and
i
might
i
would
be
silent
but
it
is
impossible
now
he
came
to
a
break
just
then
looking
at
her
to
see
what
encouragement
he
had
to
go
on
but
as
lucy
did
nothing
but
listen
and
grow
pale
he
had
to
take
his
own
way
what
i
have
to
say
is
not
anything
new
said
the
curate
labouring
a
little
in
his
voice
as
was
inevitable
when
affairs
had
come
to
such
a
crisis
if
i
were
not
in
the
cruelest
position
possible
to
a
man
i
have
only
an
empty
love
to
lay
at
your
feet
i
tell
it
to
you
only
because
i
am
obliged
because
after
all
love
is
worth
telling
even
if
it
comes
to
nothing
i
am
not
going
to
appeal
to
your
generosity
continued
the
young
man
kneeling
down
at
the
table
not
by
way
of
kneeling
to
lucy
but
by
way
of
bringing
himself
on
a
level
with
her
where
she
sat
with
her
head
bent
down
on
her
low
chair
or
to
ask
you
to
bind
yourself
to
a
man
who
has
nothing
in
the
world
but
love
to
offer
you
but
after
what
has
been
for
years
after
all
the
hours
i
have
spent
here
i
can
not
part
i
can
not
let
you
go
without
a
word
and
here
he
stopped
short
he
had
not
asked
anything
so
that
lucy
even
had
she
been
able
had
nothing
to
answer
and
as
for
the
young
lover
himself
he
seemed
to
have
come
to
the
limit
of
his
eloquence
he
kept
waiting
for
a
moment
gazing
at
her
in
breathless
expectation
of
a
response
for
which
his
own
words
had
left
no
room
then
he
rose
in
an
indescribable
tumult
of
disappointment
and
mortification
unable
to
conclude
that
all
was
over
unable
to
keep
silence
yet
not
knowing
what
to
say
i
have
been
obliged
to
close
all
the
doors
of
advancement
upon
myself
said
the
curate
with
a
little
bitterness
i
do
know
if
you
understand
me
at
this
moment
i
have
to
deny
myself
the
dearest
privilege
of
existence
do
mistake
me
lucy
he
said
after
another
pause
coming
back
to
her
with
humility
i
do
venture
to
say
that
you
would
have
accepted
anything
i
had
to
offer
but
this
i
mean
that
to
have
a
home
for
you
now
to
have
a
life
for
you
ready
to
be
laid
at
your
feet
whether
you
would
have
had
it
or
not
what
right
have
i
to
speak
of
such
delights
cried
the
young
man
it
does
not
matter
to
you
and
as
for
me
i
have
patience
patience
to
console
myself
with
poor
lucy
though
she
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
which
nothing
but
the
most
passionate
could
have
kept
in
could
not
help
a
passing
sensation
of
amusement
at
these
words
not
too
much
of
that
either
she
said
softly
with
a
tremulous
smile
but
patience
carries
the
lilies
of
the
saints
said
lucy
with
a
touch
of
the
sweet
asceticism
which
had
once
been
so
charming
to
the
young
anglican
it
brought
him
back
like
a
spell
to
the
common
ground
on
which
they
used
to
meet
it
brought
him
back
also
to
his
former
position
on
his
knee
which
was
embarrassing
to
lucy
though
she
had
not
the
heart
to
draw
back
nor
even
to
withdraw
her
hand
which
somehow
happened
to
be
in
mr
wentworth
way
i
am
but
a
man
said
the
young
lover
i
would
rather
have
the
roses
of
life
but
lucy
i
am
only
a
perpetual
curate
he
continued
with
her
hand
in
his
her
answer
was
made
in
the
most
heartless
and
indifferent
words
she
let
two
big
drops
which
fell
like
hail
though
they
were
warmer
than
any
summer
rain
drop
out
of
her
eyes
and
she
said
with
lips
that
had
some
difficulty
in
enunciating
that
heartless
sentiment
i
do
see
what
it
matters
to
me
which
was
true
enough
though
it
did
not
sound
encouraging
and
it
is
dreadful
to
confess
that
for
a
little
while
after
neither
skelmersdale
nor
wentworth
nor
mr
proctor
new
rectory
nor
the
of
the
perpetual
curate
of
st
roque
had
the
smallest
place
in
the
thoughts
of
either
of
these
perfectly
inconsiderate
young
people
for
half
an
hour
they
were
an
emperor
and
empress
seated
upon
two
thrones
to
which
all
the
world
was
subject
and
when
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
began
to
remember
the
world
it
was
but
to
laugh
at
it
in
their
infinite
youthful
superiority
then
it
became
apparent
that
to
remain
in
carlingford
to
work
at
the
district
to
carry
out
all
the
ancient
intentions
of
which
had
been
the
first
bond
between
them
was
after
all
the
life
of
lives
which
was
the
state
of
mind
they
had
both
arrived
at
when
miss
wodehouse
who
thought
they
had
been
too
long
together
under
the
circumstances
and
could
not
help
wondering
what
mr
wentworth
could
be
saying
came
into
the
room
rather
flurried
in
her
own
person
she
thought
lucy
must
have
been
telling
the
curate
about
mr
proctor
and
his
hopes
and
was
to
tell
the
truth
a
little
curious
how
mr
wentworth
would
take
it
and
a
little
the
very
least
ashamed
of
encountering
his
critical
looks
the
condition
of
mind
into
which
miss
wodehouse
was
thrown
when
she
perceived
the
real
state
of
affairs
would
be
difficult
to
describe
she
was
very
glad
and
very
sorry
and
utterly
puzzled
how
they
were
to
live
and
underneath
all
these
varying
emotions
was
a
sudden
sense
of
being
cast
into
the
shade
which
made
mr
proctor
laugh
and
made
her
cry
and
brought
her
down
altogether
off
the
temporary
pedestal
upon
which
she
had
stepped
not
without
a
little
feminine
satisfaction
when
a
woman
is
going
to
be
married
especially
if
that
marriage
falls
later
than
usual
it
is
natural
that
she
should
expect
for
that
time
at
least
to
be
the
first
and
most
prominent
figure
in
her
little
circle
but
alas
what
chance
could
there
be
for
a
mild
bride
of
forty
beside
a
creature
of
half
her
age
endued
with
all
the
natural
bloom
and
natural
interest
of
youth
miss
wodehouse
could
not
quite
make
out
her
own
feelings
on
the
subject
do
you
think
if
you
had
waited
a
little
it
would
have
been
wiser
she
said
in
her
timid
way
and
then
kissed
her
young
sister
and
said
i
am
so
glad
my
darling
i
am
sure
dear
papa
would
have
been
pleased
with
a
sob
which
brought
back
to
lucy
the
grief
from
which
she
had
for
the
moment
escaped
under
all
the
circumstances
however
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
it
was
rather
hard
upon
mr
wentworth
to
recollect
that
he
had
engaged
to
return
to
luncheon
with
the
squire
and
to
prepare
himself
after
this
momentous
morning
work
to
face
all
the
complications
of
the
family
where
still
skelmersdale
and
wentworth
were
hanging
in
the
balance
and
where
the
minds
of
his
kith
and
kin
were
already
too
full
of
excitement
to
leave
much
room
for
another
event
he
went
away
reluctantly
enough
out
of
the
momentary
paradise
where
his
perpetual
curacy
was
a
matter
of
utter
indifference
if
not
a
tender
pleasantry
which
rather
increased
than
diminished
the
happiness
of
the
moment
into
the
ordinary
daylight
world
where
it
was
a
very
serious
matter
and
where
what
the
young
couple
would
have
to
live
upon
became
the
real
question
to
be
considered
mr
wentworth
met
wodehouse
as
he
went
out
which
did
not
mend
matters
the
vagabond
was
loitering
about
in
the
garden
attended
by
one
of
elsworthy
with
whom
he
was
in
earnest
conversation
and
stopped
in
his
talk
to
give
a
sulky
nod
and
good
morning
to
which
the
curate
had
no
desire
to
respond
more
warmly
than
was
necessary
lucy
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
himself
and
perhaps
a
little
of
the
great
work
at
wharfside
which
her
illness
and
death
had
interrupted
but
mr
wentworth
who
was
only
a
man
remembered
that
tom
wodehouse
would
be
his
with
a
distinct
sensation
of
disgust
even
in
the
moment
of
his
triumph
which
is
one
instance
of
the
perennial
inequality
between
the
two
halves
of
mankind
he
had
to
brace
himself
up
to
the
encounter
of
all
his
people
while
she
had
to
meet
nothing
less
delightful
than
her
own
dreams
this
was
how
matters
came
to
an
issue
in
respect
of
frank
personal
happiness
his
worldly
affairs
were
all
astray
as
yet
and
he
had
not
the
most
distant
indication
of
any
gleam
of
light
dawning
upon
the
horizon
which
could
reconcile
his
duty
and
honour
with
good
fortune
and
the
delights
of
life
meanwhile
other
discussions
were
going
on
in
carlingford
of
vital
importance
to
the
two
young
people
who
had
made
up
their
minds
to
cast
themselves
upon
providence
and
among
the
various
conversations
which
were
being
carried
on
about
the
same
moment
in
respect
to
mr
wentworth
whose
affairs
as
was
natural
were
extensively
canvassed
in
grange
lane
as
well
as
in
other
less
exclusive
quarters
it
would
be
wrong
to
omit
a
remarkable
consultation
which
took
place
in
the
rectory
where
mrs
morgan
sat
in
the
midst
of
the
great
bouquets
of
the
carpet
making
up
her
first
matrimonial
difficulty
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
what
influence
the
carpet
in
the
rectory
had
on
the
fortunes
of
the
perpetual
curate
but
when
mr
wentworth
friends
come
to
hear
the
entire
outs
and
ins
of
the
business
it
will
be
seen
that
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
mr
proctor
covered
the
floor
of
that
pretty
apartment
with
roses
and
lilies
half
a
yard
long
chapter
xliii
these
were
eventful
days
in
grange
lane
when
gossip
was
not
nearly
rapid
enough
to
follow
the
march
of
events
when
mr
wentworth
went
to
lunch
with
his
family
the
two
sisters
kept
together
in
the
which
seemed
again
to
the
purposes
of
life
lucy
had
not
much
inclination
just
at
that
moment
to
move
out
of
her
chair
she
was
not
sociable
to
tell
the
truth
nor
disposed
to
talk
even
about
the
new
prospects
which
were
brightening
over
both
she
even
took
out
her
needlework
to
the
disgust
of
her
sister
when
there
are
so
many
things
to
talk
about
and
so
much
to
be
considered
miss
wodehouse
said
with
a
little
indignation
and
wondered
within
herself
whether
lucy
was
really
insensible
to
what
had
happened
or
whether
the
sense
of
duty
was
strong
upon
her
little
sister
even
in
the
height
of
her
happiness
a
woman
of
greater
experience
or
discrimination
might
have
perceived
that
lucy
had
retired
into
that
sacred
silence
sweetest
of
all
youthful
privileges
in
which
she
could
dream
over
to
herself
the
wonderful
hour
which
had
just
come
to
an
end
and
the
fair
future
of
which
it
was
the
gateway
as
for
miss
wodehouse
herself
she
was
in
a
flutter
and
could
not
get
over
the
sense
of
haste
and
confusion
which
this
last
new
incident
had
brought
upon
her
things
were
going
too
fast
around
her
and
the
timid
woman
was
out
of
breath
lucy
composure
at
such
a
moment
and
above
all
the
production
of
her
needlework
was
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
elder
sister
my
dear
said
miss
wodehouse
with
an
effort
i
do
doubt
that
these
poor
people
are
badly
off
and
i
am
sure
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
work
for
them
but
if
you
will
only
think
how
many
things
there
are
to
do
my
darling
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
to
make
your
own
dresses
in
future
which
is
what
i
never
thought
to
see
she
said
putting
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
we
have
not
had
any
talk
about
anything
lucy
and
there
are
so
many
things
to
think
of
miss
wodehouse
who
was
moving
about
the
room
as
she
spoke
began
to
lift
her
own
books
and
special
property
off
the
centre
table
the
books
were
principally
ancient
annuals
in
pretty
bindings
which
no
representation
on
lucy
part
could
induce
her
to
think
out
of
date
and
among
her
other
possessions
was
a
little
desk
in
indian
mosaic
of
ivory
which
had
been
an
institution
in
the
house
from
lucy
earliest
recollection
and
these
are
yours
lucy
dear
said
miss
wodehouse
standing
up
on
a
chair
to
take
down
from
the
wall
two
little
pictures
which
hung
side
by
side
they
were
copies
both
and
neither
of
great
value
one
representing
the
san
sisto
madonna
and
the
other
a
sweet
st
agnes
whom
lucy
had
in
her
earlier
days
taken
to
her
heart
slumbering
attention
was
roused
by
this
sacrilegious
act
she
gave
a
little
scream
and
dropped
her
work
out
of
her
hands
what
do
i
mean
said
miss
wodehouse
indeed
lucy
dear
we
must
look
it
in
the
face
it
is
not
our
any
longer
you
know
here
she
made
a
pause
and
sighed
but
somehow
a
vision
of
the
other
which
was
awaiting
her
in
the
new
rectory
made
the
prospect
less
doleful
than
it
might
have
been
she
cleared
up
in
a
surprising
way
as
she
turned
to
look
at
her
own
property
on
the
table
my
cousin
jack
gave
me
this
said
the
gentle
woman
brushing
a
little
dust
off
her
pretty
desk
when
it
came
first
there
was
nothing
like
it
in
carlingford
for
that
was
before
colonel
chiley
and
those
other
indian
people
had
settled
here
jack
was
rather
fond
of
me
in
those
days
you
know
though
i
never
cared
for
him
the
elder
sister
continued
with
a
smile
poor
fellow
they
said
he
was
not
very
happy
when
he
married
though
this
was
rather
a
sad
fact
miss
wodehouse
announced
it
not
without
a
certain
gentle
satisfaction
and
lucy
dear
it
is
our
duty
to
put
aside
our
own
things
they
were
all
presents
you
know
she
said
standing
up
on
the
chair
again
to
reach
down
the
st
agnes
which
ever
since
lucy
had
been
confirmed
had
hung
opposite
to
her
on
the
wall
oh
do
do
cried
lucy
in
that
little
bit
of
time
not
more
than
five
minutes
as
it
appeared
the
familiar
room
which
had
just
heard
the
romance
of
her
youth
had
come
to
have
a
dismantled
and
desolate
look
the
agent
of
this
destruction
who
saw
in
her
eye
a
new
scene
altogether
surpassing
the
old
looked
complacently
upon
her
work
and
piled
the
abstracted
articles
on
the
top
of
each
other
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
property
and
your
little
chair
and
are
yours
said
miss
wodehouse
they
were
always
considered
yours
you
worked
the
chair
yourself
though
perhaps
miss
gibbons
helped
you
a
little
and
the
table
you
know
was
sent
home
the
day
you
were
eighteen
it
was
a
present
you
remember
do
cry
my
darling
do
cry
oh
i
am
sure
i
did
not
mean
anything
cried
miss
wodehouse
putting
down
the
st
agnes
and
flying
to
her
sister
about
whom
she
threw
her
arms
my
hands
are
all
dusty
dear
said
the
repentant
woman
but
you
know
lucy
we
must
look
it
in
the
face
for
it
is
not
our
now
tom
may
come
in
any
day
and
say
oh
dear
dear
here
is
some
one
coming
lucy
extricated
herself
from
her
sister
arms
when
she
heard
footsteps
outside
if
it
is
anybody
who
has
a
right
to
come
i
suppose
we
are
able
to
receive
them
she
said
and
sat
erect
over
her
needlework
with
a
changed
countenance
not
condescending
so
much
as
to
look
towards
the
door
but
what
if
it
should
be
tom
oh
lucy
dear
do
be
uncivil
to
him
said
the
elder
sister
miss
wodehouse
even
made
a
furtive
attempt
to
replace
the
things
in
which
she
was
indignantly
stopped
by
lucy
but
my
dear
perhaps
it
is
tom
said
the
alarmed
woman
and
sank
trembling
into
a
chair
against
the
st
agnes
which
had
just
been
deposited
there
it
does
not
matter
who
it
is
said
lucy
with
dignity
for
her
own
part
she
felt
too
much
aggrieved
to
mention
his
name
aggrieved
by
her
own
ignorance
by
the
deception
that
had
been
practised
upon
her
by
the
character
of
the
man
whom
she
was
obliged
to
call
her
brother
and
chiefly
by
his
existence
which
was
the
principal
grievance
of
all
lucy
brief
life
had
been
embellished
almost
ever
since
she
had
been
capable
of
independent
action
by
deeds
and
thoughts
of
mercy
with
her
whole
heart
she
was
a
disciple
of
him
who
came
to
seek
the
lost
notwithstanding
a
natural
human
sentiment
in
her
heart
protested
against
the
existence
of
this
man
who
had
brought
shame
and
distress
into
the
family
without
any
act
of
theirs
and
who
injured
everybody
he
came
in
contact
with
when
the
thought
of
rosa
elsworthy
occurred
to
her
a
burning
blush
came
upon
lucy
cheek
why
were
such
men
permitted
in
god
world
to
be
sure
when
she
came
to
be
aware
of
what
she
was
thinking
lucy
felt
guilty
and
called
herself
a
pharisee
and
said
a
prayer
in
her
heart
for
the
man
who
had
upset
all
her
cherished
ideas
of
her
family
and
home
but
after
all
was
an
and
did
not
alter
her
instinctive
sense
of
repulsion
and
indignation
all
this
swept
rapidly
through
her
mind
while
she
sat
awaiting
the
entrance
of
the
person
or
persons
who
were
approaching
the
door
if
it
is
the
owner
of
the
house
it
will
be
best
to
tell
him
what
things
you
mean
to
remove
said
lucy
and
before
miss
wodehouse
could
answer
the
door
was
opened
they
started
however
to
perceive
not
wodehouse
but
a
personage
of
very
different
appearance
who
came
in
with
an
easy
air
of
polite
apology
and
looked
at
them
with
eyes
which
recalled
to
lucy
the
eyes
which
had
been
gazing
into
her
own
scarcely
an
hour
ago
pardon
me
said
this
visitor
your
brother
miss
wodehouse
finds
some
difficulty
in
explaining
himself
to
relations
from
whom
he
has
been
separated
so
long
not
to
interfere
with
family
privacy
will
you
let
me
assist
at
the
conference
said
jack
wentworth
my
brother
i
understand
is
a
friend
of
yours
and
your
brother
is
a
hem
friend
of
mine
the
diplomatist
added
scarcely
able
to
avoid
making
a
wry
face
over
the
statement
wodehouse
came
in
behind
looking
an
inch
or
two
taller
for
that
acknowledgment
and
sat
down
confronting
his
sisters
who
were
standing
on
the
defensive
the
heir
too
had
a
strong
sense
of
property
as
was
natural
and
the
disarrangement
of
the
room
struck
him
in
that
point
of
view
especially
as
miss
wodehouse
continued
to
prop
herself
up
against
the
st
agnes
in
the
back
of
her
chair
wodehouse
looked
from
the
wall
to
the
table
and
saw
what
appeared
to
him
a
clear
case
of
intended
spoliation
by
jove
they
did
mean
to
go
said
the
vagabond
who
naturally
judged
according
to
his
own
standard
and
knew
no
better
upon
which
lucy
rising
with
youthful
state
and
dignity
took
the
explanation
upon
herself
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
have
the
mortification
of
a
spectator
said
lucy
who
already
having
been
engaged
of
an
hour
felt
deeply
disinclined
to
reveal
the
weak
points
of
her
own
family
to
the
inspection
of
the
wentworths
all
that
there
is
to
explain
can
be
done
very
simply
thank
you
i
will
not
sit
down
up
to
this
time
we
may
be
allowed
to
imagine
ourselves
in
our
own
in
our
father
house
what
we
have
to
say
is
simple
enough
but
pardon
me
my
dear
miss
wodehouse
said
jack
wentworth
my
sister
is
miss
wodehouse
said
lucy
what
there
is
to
settle
had
better
be
arranged
with
our
our
brother
if
he
will
tell
us
precisely
when
he
wishes
us
to
go
away
we
shall
be
ready
mary
is
going
to
be
married
she
went
on
turning
round
so
as
to
face
wodehouse
and
addressing
him
pointedly
though
she
did
not
look
at
him
to
the
exclusion
of
jack
who
experienced
man
as
he
was
felt
disconcerted
and
addressed
himself
with
more
precaution
to
a
task
which
was
less
easy
than
he
supposed
oh
lucy
cried
miss
wodehouse
with
a
blush
worthy
of
eighteen
it
was
perhaps
the
first
time
that
the
fact
had
been
so
broadly
stated
and
the
sudden
announcement
made
before
two
men
overwhelmed
the
timid
woman
then
she
was
older
than
lucy
and
had
picked
up
in
the
course
of
her
career
one
or
two
inevitable
scraps
of
experience
and
she
could
not
but
wonder
with
a
momentary
qualm
what
mr
proctor
might
think
of
his
lucy
who
thought
mr
proctor
only
too
well
off
went
on
without
regarding
her
sister
exclamation
i
do
not
know
when
the
marriage
is
to
be
i
do
suppose
they
have
fixed
it
yet
said
lucy
but
it
appears
to
me
that
it
would
save
us
all
some
trouble
if
we
were
allowed
to
remain
until
that
time
i
do
not
mean
to
ask
any
favour
she
said
with
a
little
more
sharpness
and
less
dignity
we
could
pay
rent
for
that
matter
if
if
it
were
desired
she
is
your
sister
said
lucy
suddenly
looking
wodehouse
in
the
face
as
well
as
mine
i
daresay
she
has
done
as
much
for
you
as
she
has
for
me
i
do
ask
any
favour
for
her
but
i
would
cut
off
my
little
finger
if
that
would
please
her
cried
the
excited
young
woman
with
a
wildness
of
illustration
so
totally
out
of
keeping
with
the
matter
referred
to
that
miss
wodehouse
in
the
midst
of
her
emotion
could
scarcely
restrain
a
scream
of
terror
and
you
too
might
be
willing
to
do
something
you
can
not
have
any
kind
of
feeling
for
me
lucy
continued
recovering
herself
but
you
might
perhaps
have
some
feeling
for
mary
if
we
can
be
permitted
to
remain
until
her
marriage
takes
place
it
may
perhaps
bring
about
a
feeling
more
like
relations
and
i
shall
be
able
to
forgive
you
lucy
was
about
to
say
but
fortunately
stopped
herself
in
time
for
it
was
the
fact
of
his
existence
that
she
had
to
forgive
and
naturally
such
an
amount
of
toleration
was
difficult
to
explain
as
for
wodehouse
himself
he
listened
to
this
appeal
with
very
mingled
feelings
some
natural
admiration
and
liking
woke
in
his
dull
mind
as
lucy
spoke
he
was
not
destitute
of
good
impulses
nor
of
the
ordinary
human
affections
his
little
sister
was
pretty
and
a
lady
and
clever
enough
to
put
jack
wentworth
much
more
in
the
background
than
usual
he
said
by
jove
to
himself
three
or
four
times
over
in
his
beard
and
showed
a
little
emotion
when
she
said
he
could
have
no
feeling
for
her
at
that
point
of
lucy
address
he
moved
about
uneasily
in
his
chair
and
plucked
at
his
beard
and
felt
himself
anything
but
comfortable
by
jove
i
never
had
a
chance
the
prodigal
said
in
his
undertone
i
might
have
cared
a
deal
for
her
if
i
had
had
a
chance
she
might
have
done
a
fellow
good
by
jove
mutterings
of
which
lucy
took
no
manner
of
notice
but
proceeded
with
her
speech
when
she
had
ended
and
it
became
apparent
that
an
answer
was
expected
of
him
wodehouse
flushed
all
over
with
the
embarrassment
of
the
position
he
cleared
his
throat
he
shifted
his
eyes
which
were
embarrassed
by
lucy
gaze
he
pushed
his
chair
from
the
table
and
made
various
attempts
to
collect
himself
but
at
last
ended
by
a
pitiful
appeal
to
jack
wentworth
who
had
been
looking
seriously
on
you
might
come
to
a
fellow
assistance
cried
wodehouse
by
jove
it
was
for
that
you
came
here
the
miss
wodehouses
evidently
prefer
to
communicate
with
their
brother
direct
said
jack
wentworth
which
is
a
very
natural
sentiment
if
i
interfere
it
is
simply
because
i
have
had
the
advantage
of
talking
the
matter
over
and
understanding
a
little
of
what
you
mean
miss
wodehouse
your
brother
is
not
disposed
to
act
the
part
of
a
domestic
tyrant
he
has
come
here
to
offer
you
the
house
which
must
have
so
many
tender
associations
for
you
not
for
a
short
period
as
you
wish
but
for
i
did
know
she
was
going
to
be
married
exclaimed
wodehouse
that
makes
all
the
difference
by
jove
lucy
will
marry
fast
enough
but
as
for
mary
i
never
thought
she
would
hook
any
one
at
her
time
of
life
said
the
vagabond
with
a
rude
laugh
he
turned
to
lucy
not
knowing
any
better
and
with
some
intention
of
pleasing
her
but
being
met
by
a
look
of
indignation
under
which
he
faltered
he
went
back
to
his
natural
rôle
of
sulky
insolence
by
jove
when
i
gave
in
to
make
such
an
offer
i
never
thought
she
had
a
chance
of
getting
married
said
the
heir
i
aint
going
to
give
what
belongs
to
me
to
another
man
your
brother
wishes
said
jack
wentworth
calmly
to
make
over
the
house
and
furniture
as
it
stands
to
you
and
your
sister
miss
wodehouse
of
course
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
should
be
sorry
to
get
his
father
property
but
he
is
sorry
that
there
should
be
no
no
provision
for
you
he
means
that
you
should
have
the
house
but
i
never
thought
she
was
going
to
be
married
by
jove
protested
the
rightful
owner
look
here
molly
you
shall
have
the
furniture
the
house
would
sell
for
a
good
bit
of
money
i
tell
you
wentworth
jack
wentworth
did
not
move
from
the
mantlepiece
where
he
was
standing
but
he
cast
a
glance
upon
his
unlucky
follower
which
froze
the
words
on
his
lips
my
good
fellow
you
are
quite
at
liberty
to
decline
my
mediation
in
your
affairs
probably
you
can
manage
them
better
your
own
way
said
wodehouse
hero
i
can
only
beg
the
miss
wodehouses
to
pardon
my
intrusion
jack
wentworth
first
step
towards
the
door
let
loose
a
flood
of
nameless
terrors
upon
the
soul
of
his
victim
if
he
were
abandoned
by
his
powerful
protector
what
would
become
of
him
his
very
desire
of
money
and
the
avarice
which
prompted
him
to
grudge
making
any
provision
for
his
sisters
was
after
all
not
real
avarice
but
the
spendthrift
longing
for
more
to
spend
the
house
which
he
was
sentenced
to
give
up
represented
not
so
much
gold
and
silver
but
so
many
pleasures
fine
dinners
and
bad
company
he
could
order
the
dinners
by
himself
it
is
true
and
get
men
like
himself
to
eat
them
but
the
fine
people
the
men
who
had
once
been
fine
and
who
still
retained
a
certain
tarnished
glory
were
so
far
as
wodehouse
was
concerned
entirely
in
jack
wentworth
keeping
he
made
a
piteous
appeal
to
his
patron
as
the
great
man
turned
to
go
away
i
do
see
what
good
it
can
do
to
rob
a
poor
fellow
cried
wodehouse
but
look
here
i
aint
going
to
turn
against
your
advice
i
give
it
them
by
jove
for
life
that
is
for
mary
life
said
the
munificent
brother
she
twenty
years
older
than
lucy
how
do
you
dare
to
subject
us
to
such
insults
cried
the
indignant
lucy
whose
little
hand
clenched
involuntarily
in
her
passion
she
had
a
great
deal
of
but
she
was
not
quite
equal
to
such
an
emergency
and
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
from
stamping
her
foot
which
was
the
only
utterance
of
rage
possible
to
a
gentlewoman
in
her
position
i
would
rather
see
my
father
house
desecrated
by
you
living
in
it
she
cried
passionately
than
accept
it
as
a
gift
from
your
hands
mary
we
are
not
obliged
to
submit
to
this
let
us
rather
go
away
at
once
i
will
not
remain
in
the
same
room
with
this
man
cried
lucy
she
was
so
overwhelmed
with
her
unwonted
passion
that
she
lost
all
command
of
the
position
and
even
of
herself
and
was
false
for
the
moment
to
all
her
sweet
codes
of
womanly
behaviour
how
dare
you
sir
she
cried
in
the
sudden
storm
for
which
nobody
was
prepared
we
will
remove
the
things
belonging
to
us
with
which
nobody
has
any
right
to
interfere
and
we
will
leave
immediately
mary
come
with
me
when
she
had
said
this
lucy
swept
out
of
the
room
pale
as
a
little
fury
and
feeling
in
her
heart
a
savage
female
inclination
to
strike
jack
wentworth
who
opened
the
door
for
her
with
her
little
white
clenched
hand
too
much
excited
to
remark
whether
her
sister
had
followed
her
lucy
ran
to
her
room
and
there
gave
way
to
the
inevitable
tears
coming
to
herself
after
that
was
a
terribly
humbling
process
to
the
little
anglican
she
had
never
fallen
into
a
passion
before
that
she
knew
of
certainly
never
since
nursery
times
and
often
enough
her
severe
serene
girlhood
had
looked
reproving
and
surprised
upon
the
tumults
of
prickett
lane
awing
the
belligerents
into
at
least
temporary
silence
now
poor
lucy
sat
and
cried
over
her
downfall
she
had
forgotten
herself
she
had
been
conscious
of
an
inclination
to
stamp
to
scold
even
to
strike
in
the
vehemence
of
her
indignation
and
she
was
utterly
overpowered
by
the
thought
of
her
guiltiness
the
very
first
temptation
she
said
to
herself
and
made
terrible
reflections
upon
her
own
want
of
strength
and
endurance
too
of
all
days
when
god
had
been
so
good
to
her
if
i
yield
to
the
first
temptation
like
this
how
shall
i
ever
endure
to
the
end
cried
lucy
and
in
her
heart
thought
with
a
certain
longing
of
the
sacrament
of
penance
and
tried
to
think
what
she
could
do
that
would
be
most
disagreeable
to
the
mortifying
of
the
flesh
perhaps
if
she
had
possessed
a
more
lively
sense
of
humour
another
view
of
the
subject
might
have
struck
lucy
but
humour
fortunately
for
the
unity
of
human
sentiment
is
generally
developed
at
a
later
period
of
life
and
fit
of
passion
only
made
her
think
with
greater
tenderness
and
toleration
of
her
termagants
in
prickett
lane
the
three
who
were
left
were
in
their
different
ways
impressed
by
lucy
passion
jack
wentworth
being
a
man
of
humour
and
cultivation
was
amused
but
respectful
as
having
still
a
certain
faculty
of
appreciating
absolute
purity
when
he
saw
it
as
for
wodehouse
he
gave
another
rude
laugh
but
was
cowed
in
spite
of
himself
and
felt
involuntarily
what
a
shabby
wretch
he
was
recognising
that
fact
more
impressively
from
the
contempt
of
pale
face
than
he
could
have
done
through
hours
of
argument
miss
wodehouse
for
her
part
though
very
anxious
and
nervous
was
not
without
an
interest
in
the
question
under
discussion
was
not
specially
horrified
by
her
brother
or
anything
he
could
say
or
do
he
was
tom
to
her
a
boy
with
whom
she
had
once
played
and
whom
she
had
shielded
with
all
her
sisterly
might
in
his
first
transgressions
she
had
suffered
a
great
deal
more
by
his
means
than
lucy
could
ever
suffer
and
consequently
was
more
tolerant
of
him
she
kept
her
seat
with
the
st
agnes
in
the
chair
behind
and
watched
the
course
of
events
with
anxious
steadiness
she
did
not
care
for
money
any
more
than
lucy
did
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
it
would
be
very
pleasant
if
she
could
produce
one
good
action
on
poor
tom
part
to
plead
for
him
against
any
possible
criticisms
of
the
future
miss
wodehouse
was
old
enough
to
know
that
her
rector
was
not
an
ideal
hero
but
an
ordinary
man
and
it
was
quite
possible
that
he
might
point
a
future
moral
now
and
then
with
that
brother
of
yours
my
dear
the
elder
sister
waited
accordingly
with
her
heart
beating
quick
to
know
the
decision
very
anxious
that
she
might
have
at
least
one
generous
deed
to
record
to
the
advantage
of
poor
tom
i
think
we
are
quite
decided
on
the
point
said
jack
wentworth
knowing
your
sentiments
wodehouse
i
left
directions
with
waters
about
the
papers
i
think
you
will
find
him
to
be
trusted
miss
wodehouse
if
you
wish
to
consult
him
about
letting
or
selling
by
jove
exclaimed
wodehouse
under
his
breath
which
i
suppose
continued
the
superb
jack
you
will
wish
to
do
under
the
pleasant
circumstances
upon
which
i
beg
to
offer
you
my
congratulations
now
tom
my
good
fellow
i
am
at
your
service
i
think
we
have
done
our
business
here
wodehouse
got
up
in
his
sulky
reluctant
way
like
a
lazy
dog
i
suppose
you
wo
try
to
move
the
furniture
now
he
said
these
were
the
only
adieux
he
intended
to
make
and
perhaps
they
might
have
been
expressed
with
still
less
civility
had
not
jack
wentworth
been
standing
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
oh
tom
i
am
so
thankful
you
have
done
it
cried
miss
wodehouse
it
is
not
that
i
care
for
the
money
but
oh
tom
i
am
so
glad
to
think
nobody
can
say
anything
now
she
followed
them
wistfully
to
the
door
not
giving
up
hopes
of
a
kinder
parting
i
think
it
is
very
kind
and
nice
of
you
and
what
dear
papa
would
have
wished
said
the
elder
sister
forgetting
how
all
her
father
plans
had
been
brought
to
nothing
and
of
course
you
will
live
here
all
the
same
she
said
with
a
little
eagerness
that
is
till
till
as
long
as
we
are
here
miss
wodehouse
said
jack
wentworth
i
do
think
either
your
brother
or
i
will
stay
much
longer
in
carlingford
you
must
accept
my
best
wishes
for
your
happiness
all
the
same
you
are
very
kind
i
am
sure
said
the
embarrassed
bride
and
oh
tom
you
will
surely
say
say
once
as
if
you
meant
it
do
go
away
as
if
you
did
not
care
tom
i
always
was
very
fond
of
you
and
do
you
feel
a
little
different
to
us
now
you
done
us
a
kindness
cried
miss
wodehouse
going
out
after
him
to
the
but
wodehouse
was
in
no
humour
to
be
gracious
instead
of
paying
any
attention
to
her
he
looked
regretfully
at
the
property
he
had
lost
he
said
vaguely
by
jove
i
know
better
than
jack
wentworth
does
the
value
of
property
we
might
have
had
a
jolly
month
at
homburg
out
of
that
old
place
said
the
prodigal
with
regret
as
he
went
down
the
oak
stair
that
was
his
farewell
to
the
house
which
he
had
entered
so
disastrously
on
the
day
of
his
funeral
he
followed
his
leader
with
a
sulky
aspect
through
the
garden
not
venturing
to
disobey
but
yet
feeling
the
weight
of
his
chains
and
this
was
how
wodehouse
accomplished
his
personal
share
in
the
gift
to
his
sisters
of
which
miss
wodehouse
told
everybody
that
it
was
so
good
of
tom
chapter
xliv
going
to
be
married
said
the
squire
and
to
a
sister
of
i
thought
you
told
me
she
was
as
old
as
dora
frank
i
did
not
expect
to
meet
with
any
further
complications
the
old
man
said
plaintively
of
course
you
know
very
well
i
do
object
to
your
marrying
but
why
on
earth
did
you
let
me
speak
of
wentworth
rectory
to
huxtable
cried
mr
wentworth
he
was
almost
more
impatient
about
this
new
variety
in
the
family
circumstances
than
he
had
been
of
more
serious
family
distresses
god
bless
me
sir
said
the
squire
what
do
you
mean
by
it
you
take
means
to
affront
your
aunts
and
lose
skelmersdale
and
then
you
put
it
into
my
head
to
have
mary
at
wentworth
and
then
you
quarrel
with
the
rector
and
get
into
hot
water
in
carlingford
and
to
make
an
end
of
all
you
coolly
propose
to
an
innocent
young
woman
and
tell
me
you
are
going
to
marry
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
i
am
going
to
marry
some
time
sir
i
hope
said
the
perpetual
curate
with
more
cheerfulness
than
he
felt
but
not
at
the
present
moment
of
course
we
both
know
that
is
impossible
i
should
like
you
to
come
with
me
and
see
her
before
you
leave
carlingford
she
would
like
it
and
so
should
i
well
well
said
the
squire
naturally
having
been
married
so
often
himself
he
could
not
refuse
a
certain
response
to
such
a
call
upon
his
sympathy
i
hope
you
have
made
a
wise
choice
said
the
experienced
father
not
without
a
sigh
a
great
deal
depends
upon
that
not
only
your
own
comfort
sir
but
very
often
the
character
of
your
children
and
the
credit
of
the
family
you
may
laugh
said
mr
wentworth
to
whom
it
was
no
laughing
matter
but
long
before
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
you
will
know
the
truth
of
what
i
say
your
mother
frank
was
a
specimen
of
what
a
woman
ought
to
be
not
to
speak
of
her
own
children
there
was
nobody
else
who
ever
knew
how
to
manage
gerald
and
jack
of
course
i
am
not
speaking
of
mrs
wentworth
who
has
her
nursery
to
occupy
her
said
the
squire
apologetically
i
hope
you
have
made
a
judicious
choice
i
hope
so
too
said
frank
who
was
somewhat
amused
by
this
view
of
the
question
though
i
am
not
aware
of
having
exercised
any
special
choice
in
the
matter
he
added
with
a
laugh
however
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
and
see
her
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
judge
for
yourself
the
squire
shook
his
head
and
looked
as
if
he
had
travelled
back
into
the
heavy
roll
of
family
distresses
i
do
mean
to
upbraid
you
frank
he
said
i
daresay
you
have
done
what
you
thought
was
your
duty
but
i
think
you
might
have
taken
a
little
pains
to
satisfy
your
aunt
leonora
you
see
what
gerald
has
made
of
it
with
all
his
decorations
and
nonsense
that
is
a
dreadful
drawback
with
you
clergymen
you
fix
your
eyes
so
on
one
point
that
you
get
to
think
things
important
that
are
not
in
the
least
important
could
you
imagine
a
man
of
the
world
like
jack
he
is
not
what
i
could
wish
but
still
he
is
a
man
of
the
world
said
the
squire
who
was
capable
of
contradicting
himself
with
perfect
composure
without
knowing
it
can
you
imagine
risking
his
prospects
for
a
bit
of
external
decoration
i
mind
it
myself
said
mr
wentworth
impartially
i
do
pretend
to
see
for
my
own
part
why
flowers
at
easter
should
be
considered
more
superstitious
than
holly
at
christmas
but
bless
my
soul
sir
when
your
aunt
thought
so
what
was
the
good
of
running
right
in
her
face
for
such
a
trifle
i
never
could
understand
you
parsons
the
squire
said
with
an
impatient
sigh
nobody
that
i
know
of
ever
considered
me
mercenary
but
to
ruin
your
own
prospects
all
for
a
trumpery
bunch
of
flowers
and
then
to
come
and
tell
me
you
want
to
marry
this
was
before
luncheon
when
frank
and
his
father
were
together
in
the
waiting
for
the
other
members
of
the
family
who
began
to
arrive
at
this
moment
and
prevented
any
further
discussion
after
all
perhaps
it
was
a
little
ungenerous
of
the
squire
to
press
his
son
so
hard
on
the
subject
of
those
innocent
easter
lilies
long
ago
withered
which
certainly
looked
at
from
this
distance
did
not
appear
important
enough
to
sacrifice
any
prospects
for
this
was
all
the
harder
upon
the
unfortunate
curate
as
even
at
the
time
his
conviction
of
their
necessity
had
not
proved
equal
to
the
satisfactory
settlement
of
the
question
miss
wentworth
cook
was
an
so
irreproachable
that
the
luncheon
provided
was
in
itself
perfect
but
notwithstanding
it
was
an
uncomfortable
meal
miss
leonora
in
consequence
of
the
contest
going
on
in
her
own
mind
was
in
an
explosive
and
highly
dangerous
condition
not
safe
to
be
spoken
to
and
as
for
the
squire
he
could
not
restrain
the
chance
utterances
of
his
impatience
frank
who
did
his
best
to
make
himself
agreeable
as
magnanimity
required
had
the
mortification
of
hearing
himself
discussed
in
different
tones
of
disapprobation
while
he
ate
his
cold
beef
for
mr
wentworth
broken
sentences
were
not
long
of
putting
the
party
in
possession
of
the
new
event
and
the
perpetual
curate
found
himself
the
object
of
many
wondering
and
pitying
glances
in
none
of
which
could
he
read
pure
sympathy
much
less
congratulation
even
gerald
looked
at
him
with
a
little
elevation
of
his
eyebrows
as
if
wondering
how
anybody
could
take
the
trouble
to
occupy
his
mind
with
such
trifling
temporal
affairs
as
love
and
marriage
it
was
a
wonderful
relief
to
the
unfortunate
curate
when
miss
leonora
had
finished
her
glass
of
madeira
and
rose
from
the
table
he
had
no
inclination
to
go
for
his
own
part
when
you
are
ready
sir
you
will
find
me
in
the
garden
he
said
to
his
father
who
was
to
leave
carlingford
next
morning
and
whom
he
had
set
his
heart
on
taking
to
see
lucy
but
his
walk
in
the
garden
was
far
from
being
delightful
to
frank
it
even
occurred
to
him
for
a
moment
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
a
man
could
cut
himself
adrift
from
his
relations
at
such
a
crisis
of
his
life
after
all
it
was
his
own
business
the
act
most
essentially
personal
of
his
entire
existence
and
then
with
a
little
softening
he
began
to
think
of
the
girls
at
home
of
the
little
sister
who
had
a
of
her
own
and
of
letty
who
was
frank
favourite
and
had
often
confided
to
him
the
enthusiasm
she
would
feel
for
his
bride
if
she
is
nice
letty
was
in
the
habit
of
adding
and
of
course
she
will
be
nice
and
at
that
thought
the
heart
of
the
young
lover
escaped
and
put
forth
its
wings
and
went
off
into
that
heaven
of
ideal
excellence
and
beauty
more
sweet
because
more
vague
than
anything
real
which
stands
instead
of
the
old
skies
and
clouds
at
such
a
period
of
life
he
had
to
drop
down
from
a
great
height
and
get
rid
in
all
haste
of
his
celestial
pinions
when
he
heard
his
aunt
dora
calling
him
and
his
was
not
sufficient
to
conceal
as
he
obeyed
that
summons
a
certain
annoyed
expression
in
his
face
frank
said
miss
dora
coming
softly
after
him
with
her
handkerchief
held
over
her
head
as
a
defence
from
the
sun
oh
frank
i
want
to
speak
to
you
i
could
say
anything
at
lunch
because
of
everybody
being
there
if
you
would
only
stop
a
moment
till
i
get
my
breath
frank
my
dear
boy
i
wish
you
joy
i
do
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
heart
i
should
so
like
just
to
go
and
kiss
her
and
tell
her
i
shall
love
her
for
your
sake
you
will
soon
love
her
for
her
own
sake
said
frank
to
whom
even
this
sympathy
was
very
grateful
she
is
a
great
deal
better
than
i
am
there
is
just
one
thing
said
miss
dora
oh
frank
my
dear
you
know
i
do
pretend
to
be
clever
like
leonora
or
able
to
give
you
advice
but
there
one
thing
you
know
you
have
nothing
to
marry
upon
and
all
has
gone
wrong
you
are
not
to
have
wentworth
and
you
are
not
to
have
skelmersdale
and
i
think
the
family
is
going
out
of
its
senses
not
to
see
who
is
the
most
worthy
you
have
got
nothing
to
live
upon
my
dear
dear
boy
said
miss
dora
withdrawing
the
handkerchief
from
her
head
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
to
apply
it
to
her
eyes
that
is
true
enough
said
the
perpetual
curate
but
then
we
have
not
made
up
our
minds
that
we
must
marry
immediately
frank
said
aunt
dora
with
solemnity
breaking
into
his
speech
there
is
just
thing
and
i
ca
hold
my
tongue
though
it
may
be
very
foolish
and
they
will
all
say
it
is
my
fault
it
was
a
very
quiet
but
still
there
was
a
faint
rustle
in
the
branches
which
alarmed
the
timid
woman
she
put
her
hand
upon
her
nephew
arm
and
hastened
him
on
to
the
little
in
the
wall
which
was
her
special
retirement
nobody
ever
comes
here
said
miss
dora
they
will
never
think
of
looking
for
us
here
i
am
sure
i
never
interfere
with
leonora
arrangements
nor
take
anything
upon
myself
but
there
is
one
thing
frank
yes
said
the
curate
i
understand
what
you
mean
you
are
going
to
warn
me
about
love
in
a
cottage
and
how
foolish
it
would
be
to
marry
upon
nothing
but
my
dear
aunt
we
are
not
going
to
do
anything
rash
there
is
no
such
dreadful
haste
do
be
agitated
about
it
said
the
young
man
with
a
smile
he
was
half
amused
and
half
irritated
by
the
earnestness
which
almost
took
away
the
poor
lady
breath
you
know
what
i
mean
said
aunt
dora
frank
you
know
very
well
i
never
interfere
but
i
ca
help
being
agitated
when
i
see
you
on
the
brink
of
such
a
precipice
oh
my
dear
boy
do
be
there
one
thing
and
i
must
say
it
if
i
should
die
she
had
to
pause
a
little
to
recover
her
voice
for
haste
and
excitement
had
a
tendency
to
make
her
inarticulate
frank
said
miss
dora
again
more
solemnly
than
ever
whatever
you
may
be
obliged
to
do
though
you
were
to
write
novels
or
take
pupils
or
do
translations
oh
frank
do
look
at
me
like
that
as
if
i
was
going
crazy
whatever
you
may
have
to
do
oh
my
dear
there
is
one
thing
do
go
and
break
people
hearts
and
put
it
off
and
put
it
off
till
it
never
happens
cried
the
trembling
little
woman
with
a
sudden
burst
of
tears
do
say
you
can
wait
for
you
ca
wait
and
you
ought
to
sobbed
miss
dora
she
subsided
altogether
into
her
handkerchief
and
her
chair
as
she
uttered
this
startling
and
wholly
unexpected
piece
of
advice
and
lay
there
in
a
little
heap
all
dissolving
and
floating
away
overcome
with
her
great
effort
while
her
nephew
stood
looking
at
her
from
a
height
of
astonishment
almost
too
extreme
for
wondering
if
the
trees
could
have
found
a
voice
and
counselled
his
immediate
marriage
he
could
scarcely
have
been
more
surprised
you
think
i
am
losing
my
senses
too
said
aunt
dora
but
that
is
because
you
do
understand
me
oh
frank
my
dear
boy
there
was
once
a
time
perhaps
everybody
has
forgotten
it
except
me
but
i
have
not
forgotten
it
they
treated
me
like
a
baby
and
leonora
had
everything
her
own
way
i
do
mean
to
say
it
was
not
for
the
best
said
the
aggrieved
woman
i
know
everything
is
for
the
best
if
we
could
but
see
it
and
perhaps
leonora
was
right
when
she
said
i
never
could
have
struggled
with
with
a
family
nor
lived
on
a
poor
man
income
my
dear
it
was
before
your
uncle
charley
died
and
when
we
became
rich
it
did
matter
said
miss
dora
it
was
all
over
before
then
oh
frank
if
i
had
experience
i
would
say
a
word
i
do
interfere
about
your
opinions
like
leonora
there
is
just
thing
cried
the
poor
lady
through
her
tears
perhaps
it
was
the
recollection
of
the
past
which
overcame
miss
dora
perhaps
the
force
of
habit
which
had
made
it
natural
for
her
to
cry
when
she
was
much
moved
but
the
fact
is
certain
that
the
squire
when
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
in
search
of
frank
found
his
sister
weeping
bitterly
and
his
son
making
efforts
to
console
her
in
which
some
sympathy
was
mingled
with
a
certain
frank
like
lucy
felt
tempted
to
laugh
at
the
elderly
romance
and
yet
his
heart
expanded
warmly
to
his
tender
little
foolish
aunt
who
after
all
might
once
have
been
young
and
in
love
like
himself
though
it
was
so
odd
to
realise
it
mr
wentworth
for
his
part
saw
no
humour
whatever
in
the
scene
he
thought
nothing
less
than
that
some
fresh
complication
had
taken
place
jack
had
committed
some
new
enormity
or
there
was
bad
news
from
charley
in
malta
or
unpleasant
letters
had
come
from
home
bless
my
soul
sir
something
new
has
happened
said
the
squire
and
he
was
scarcely
reassured
when
miss
dora
stumbled
up
from
her
chair
in
great
confusion
and
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
he
was
suspicious
of
this
meeting
in
the
which
seemed
a
quite
unnecessary
proceeding
to
mr
wentworth
and
though
he
flattered
himself
he
understood
women
he
could
not
give
any
reasonable
explanation
to
himself
of
dora
tears
it
is
nothing
nothing
at
all
said
miss
dora
it
was
not
doing
in
the
least
he
is
always
so
considerate
and
such
a
dear
fellow
thank
you
my
dear
boy
my
head
is
a
little
better
i
think
i
will
go
in
and
lie
down
said
the
unlucky
aunt
you
are
not
to
mind
me
now
for
i
have
quite
got
over
my
little
attack
i
always
was
so
nervous
said
miss
dora
and
i
sometimes
wonder
whether
it
is
the
wentworth
complaint
coming
on
she
added
with
a
natural
female
artifice
which
was
not
without
its
effect
i
wish
you
would
not
talk
nonsense
said
the
squire
the
wentworth
complaint
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
but
you
are
perfectly
aware
that
it
never
attacks
women
mr
wentworth
spoke
with
a
little
natural
irritation
displeased
to
have
his
prerogative
interfered
with
when
a
man
has
all
the
suffering
attendant
upon
a
special
complaint
it
is
hard
not
to
have
all
the
dignity
he
felt
so
much
and
so
justly
annoyed
by
miss
dora
vain
pretensions
that
he
forgot
his
anxiety
about
the
secret
conference
in
the
women
take
such
fantastic
ideas
into
their
heads
he
said
to
his
son
as
they
went
away
together
your
aunt
dora
is
the
kindest
soul
in
the
world
but
now
and
then
sir
she
is
very
absurd
said
the
squire
he
could
not
get
this
presumptuous
notion
out
of
his
head
but
returned
to
it
again
and
again
even
after
they
had
got
into
grange
lane
it
has
been
in
our
family
for
two
hundred
years
said
mr
wentworth
and
i
think
there
is
a
single
instance
of
its
attacking
a
woman
not
even
slightly
sir
the
squire
added
with
irritation
as
if
frank
had
taken
the
part
of
the
female
members
of
the
family
which
indeed
the
curate
had
no
thought
of
doing
miss
dora
for
her
part
having
made
this
very
successful
diversion
escaped
to
the
house
and
to
her
own
room
where
she
indulged
in
a
headache
all
the
afternoon
and
certain
tender
recollections
which
were
a
wonderful
resource
at
all
times
to
the
woman
oh
my
dear
boy
do
be
she
had
whispered
into
ear
as
she
left
him
and
her
remonstrance
simple
as
it
was
had
no
doubt
produced
a
considerable
effect
upon
the
mind
of
the
perpetual
curate
he
could
not
help
thinking
as
they
emerged
into
the
road
that
it
was
chiefly
the
impatient
and
undutiful
who
secured
their
happiness
those
who
were
constant
and
patient
and
able
to
deny
themselves
instead
of
being
rewarded
for
their
higher
qualities
were
on
the
contrary
put
to
the
full
test
of
the
strength
that
was
in
them
while
those
who
would
not
wait
attained
what
they
wanted
and
on
the
whole
as
to
other
matters
got
on
just
as
well
as
their
neighbours
this
germ
of
thought
it
may
be
supposed
was
stimulated
into
very
warm
life
by
the
reflection
that
lucy
would
have
to
leave
carlingford
with
her
sister
without
any
definite
prospect
of
returning
again
and
a
certain
flush
of
impatience
came
over
the
young
man
not
unnatural
in
the
circumstances
it
seemed
to
him
that
everybody
else
took
their
own
way
without
waiting
and
why
should
it
be
so
certain
that
he
alone
whose
way
implied
harm
to
no
one
should
be
the
only
man
condemned
to
wait
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
just
one
thing
insisted
on
by
miss
dora
was
far
from
being
without
effect
on
the
mind
of
her
nephew
upon
whom
indeed
the
events
of
the
morning
had
wrought
various
changes
of
sentiment
when
he
walked
up
grange
lane
for
the
first
time
it
had
been
without
any
acknowledged
intention
of
opening
his
mind
to
lucy
and
yet
he
had
returned
along
the
same
prosaic
and
unsympathetic
line
of
road
her
accepted
lover
her
accepted
lover
triumphant
in
that
fact
but
without
the
least
opening
of
any
hope
before
him
as
to
the
conclusion
of
the
engagement
which
prudence
had
no
hand
in
making
now
the
footsteps
of
the
perpetual
curate
fell
firmly
not
to
say
a
little
impatiently
upon
the
road
over
which
he
had
carried
so
many
varying
thoughts
he
was
as
penniless
as
ever
and
as
prospectless
but
in
the
tossings
of
his
natural
impatience
the
young
man
had
felt
the
reins
hang
loosely
about
his
head
and
knew
that
he
was
no
more
restrained
than
other
men
but
might
if
he
chose
it
have
his
way
like
the
rest
of
the
world
it
was
true
enough
that
he
might
have
to
pay
for
it
after
as
other
people
had
done
but
in
the
mean
time
the
sense
that
he
was
his
own
master
was
sweet
and
to
have
his
will
for
once
seemed
no
more
than
his
right
in
the
world
while
these
rebellious
thoughts
were
going
on
in
the
curate
mind
his
father
who
suspected
nothing
went
steadily
by
his
side
not
without
a
little
reluctance
at
the
thought
of
the
errand
on
which
he
was
bound
but
they
ca
marry
for
years
and
nobody
can
tell
what
may
happen
in
that
time
mr
wentworth
said
to
himself
with
the
callousness
of
mature
age
not
suspecting
the
different
ideas
that
were
afloat
in
the
mind
of
his
son
perhaps
on
the
whole
he
was
not
sorry
that
skelmersdale
was
destined
otherwise
and
that
huxtable
had
been
spoken
to
about
wentworth
rectory
for
of
course
frank
would
have
plunged
into
marriage
at
once
if
he
had
been
possessed
of
anything
to
marry
on
and
it
looked
providential
under
the
circumstances
as
the
squire
argued
with
himself
privately
that
at
such
a
crisis
the
perpetual
curate
should
have
fallen
between
two
stools
of
possible
preferment
and
should
still
be
obliged
to
content
himself
with
st
roque
it
was
hard
for
mr
wentworth
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
the
wife
of
his
favourite
son
should
be
the
sister
of
for
the
squire
forgot
that
his
own
girls
were
jack
wentworth
sisters
and
as
such
might
be
objected
to
in
their
turn
by
some
other
father
so
the
two
gentlemen
went
to
see
lucy
who
was
then
in
a
very
humble
frame
of
mind
just
recovered
from
her
passion
one
of
them
rather
congratulating
himself
on
the
obstacles
which
lay
before
the
young
couple
the
other
tossing
his
youthful
head
a
little
in
the
first
impulses
of
feeling
the
reins
lie
loose
upon
him
and
making
up
his
mind
to
have
his
own
way
chapter
xlv
while
mr
frank
wentworth
affairs
were
thus
gathering
to
a
crisis
other
events
likely
to
influence
his
fate
were
also
taking
place
in
carlingford
breakfast
had
been
served
a
full
later
than
usual
in
the
rectory
which
had
not
improved
the
temper
of
the
household
everything
was
going
on
with
the
most
wonderful
quietness
in
that
house
but
it
was
a
quietness
which
would
have
made
a
sensitive
visitor
uncomfortable
and
which
woke
horrible
private
qualms
in
the
mind
of
the
rector
as
for
mrs
morgan
she
fulfilled
all
her
duties
with
a
precision
which
was
terrible
to
behold
instead
of
taking
part
in
the
conversation
as
usual
and
having
her
own
opinion
she
had
suddenly
become
possessed
of
such
a
spirit
of
meekness
and
acquiescence
as
filled
her
husband
with
dismay
the
rector
was
fond
of
his
wife
and
proud
of
her
good
sense
and
her
judgment
and
powers
of
conversation
if
she
had
been
angry
and
found
fault
with
him
he
might
have
understood
that
mode
of
procedure
but
as
she
was
not
angry
but
only
silent
the
excellent
man
was
terribly
disconcerted
and
could
not
tell
what
to
do
he
had
done
all
he
could
to
be
conciliatory
and
had
already
entered
upon
a
great
many
explanations
which
had
come
to
nothing
for
want
of
any
response
and
now
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
making
tea
with
an
imperturbable
countenance
sometimes
making
little
observations
about
the
news
perfectly
calm
and
dignified
but
taking
no
part
in
anything
more
interesting
and
turning
off
any
reference
that
was
made
to
her
in
the
most
skilful
manner
mr
morgan
knows
i
never
take
any
part
in
the
gossip
of
carlingford
she
said
to
mr
proctor
without
any
intention
of
wounding
that
good
man
and
he
who
had
been
in
the
midst
of
something
about
mr
wentworth
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
with
the
sense
of
having
shown
himself
as
a
gossip
which
was
very
injurious
to
his
dignity
the
late
rector
indeed
occupied
a
very
uncomfortable
position
between
the
married
people
thus
engaged
in
the
absorbing
excitement
of
their
first
quarrel
the
quiet
little
arrows
which
mrs
morgan
intended
only
for
her
husband
grazed
and
stung
him
as
they
passed
without
missing
at
the
same
time
their
intended
aim
and
he
was
the
auditor
besides
of
a
great
deal
of
information
intended
by
the
rector
for
his
wife
benefit
to
which
mrs
morgan
paid
no
manner
of
attention
mr
proctor
was
not
a
man
of
very
lively
observation
but
he
could
not
quite
shut
his
eyes
to
the
position
of
affairs
and
the
natural
effect
upon
his
mind
in
the
circumstances
was
to
turn
his
thoughts
towards
his
mild
mary
whom
he
did
not
quite
recognise
as
yet
under
her
christian
name
he
called
her
miss
wodehouse
in
his
heart
even
while
in
the
act
of
making
comparisons
very
unfavourable
to
the
rector
wife
and
then
he
introduced
benevolently
the
subject
of
his
new
rectory
which
surely
must
be
safe
ground
it
is
a
pretty
little
place
mr
proctor
said
with
satisfaction
of
course
it
is
but
a
small
living
compared
to
carlingford
i
hope
you
will
come
and
see
me
after
it
is
furnished
said
the
bashful
bridegroom
it
is
a
nuisance
to
have
all
that
to
look
after
for
self
i
hope
you
will
have
somebody
to
help
you
said
mrs
morgan
with
a
little
earnestness
gentlemen
do
understand
about
such
things
when
you
have
one
piece
of
furniture
in
bad
taste
it
spoils
a
whole
room
carpets
for
instance
said
the
rector
wife
she
looked
at
mr
proctor
so
severely
that
the
good
man
faltered
though
he
was
not
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
his
guiltiness
i
am
sure
i
do
know
he
said
i
told
the
man
here
to
provide
everything
as
it
ought
to
be
and
i
think
we
were
very
successful
continued
mr
proctor
with
a
little
complacency
to
be
sure
they
were
in
the
at
the
moment
being
still
at
the
buller
knows
a
great
deal
about
that
sort
of
thing
but
then
he
is
too
ecclesiological
for
my
taste
i
like
things
to
look
cheerful
said
the
unsuspicious
man
buller
is
the
only
man
that
could
be
reckoned
on
if
any
living
were
to
fall
vacant
it
is
very
odd
nowadays
how
indifferent
men
are
about
the
church
i
do
say
that
it
is
not
very
pleasant
at
but
a
house
of
one
own
you
know
said
mr
proctor
looking
with
a
little
awkward
enthusiasm
at
his
brother
of
course
i
mean
a
sphere
a
career
oh
ah
yes
said
mr
morgan
with
momentary
gruffness
but
everything
has
its
drawbacks
i
do
think
buller
would
take
a
living
he
knows
too
well
what
comfortable
said
the
suffering
man
the
next
living
that
falls
will
have
to
go
to
some
one
out
of
the
college
said
mr
morgan
he
spoke
with
a
tone
of
importance
and
significance
which
moved
mr
proctor
though
he
was
not
rapid
in
his
perceptions
to
look
across
at
him
for
further
information
most
people
have
some
crotchet
or
other
said
the
rector
when
a
man
views
are
clear
about
subscription
and
that
sort
of
thing
he
generally
goes
as
far
wrong
the
other
way
buller
might
go
out
to
central
africa
perhaps
if
there
was
a
bishopric
of
wahuma
or
what
is
the
name
my
dear
in
that
nile
book
i
have
not
read
it
said
mrs
morgan
and
she
made
no
further
remark
thus
discouraged
in
his
little
attempt
at
amity
the
rector
resumed
after
a
moment
wentworth
brother
has
sent
in
his
resignation
to
his
bishop
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
any
longer
i
thought
that
delusion
had
been
over
at
all
events
and
i
suppose
now
wentworth
will
be
provided
for
said
mr
morgan
not
without
a
little
anxiety
no
they
are
all
equally
crotchety
i
think
said
mr
proctor
i
know
about
them
through
my
my
connection
with
the
wodehouses
you
know
i
should
not
wonder
for
my
own
part
if
he
went
after
his
brother
who
is
a
very
intelligent
man
though
mistaken
the
late
rector
added
with
respect
as
for
frank
wentworth
he
is
a
little
i
had
a
long
conversation
the
other
night
with
the
elder
brother
i
tried
to
draw
him
out
about
burgon
book
but
he
declined
to
enter
into
the
question
frank
has
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
in
carlingford
i
understand
he
thinks
it
right
on
account
of
his
character
being
called
in
question
here
though
of
course
no
one
in
his
senses
could
have
had
any
doubt
how
would
turn
out
said
mr
proctor
forgetting
that
he
himself
had
been
very
doubtful
about
the
curate
from
what
i
hear
they
are
all
very
crotchety
he
continued
and
finished
his
breakfast
calmly
as
if
that
settled
the
question
as
for
mrs
morgan
even
this
interesting
statement
had
no
effect
upon
her
she
looked
up
suddenly
at
one
moment
as
if
intending
to
dart
a
reproachful
glance
at
her
husband
but
bethought
herself
in
time
and
remained
passive
as
before
not
the
less
however
was
she
moved
by
what
she
had
just
heard
it
was
not
mr
wentworth
she
was
thinking
of
except
in
a
very
secondary
degree
what
occupied
her
and
made
her
reflections
bitter
was
the
thought
that
her
husband
the
man
to
whom
she
had
been
faithful
for
ten
weary
years
had
taken
himself
down
off
the
pedestal
on
which
she
had
placed
him
to
make
idols
and
to
find
them
clay
she
said
plaintively
in
her
own
mind
women
were
all
fools
to
spend
their
time
and
strength
in
constructing
such
pedestals
mrs
morgan
thought
to
herself
with
bitterness
and
as
to
the
men
who
were
so
perpetually
dethroning
themselves
how
were
they
to
be
designated
to
think
of
her
william
of
whom
she
had
once
made
a
hero
ruining
thus
for
a
little
petty
malice
and
rivalry
the
prospects
of
another
man
while
these
painful
reflections
were
going
through
her
mind
she
was
putting
away
her
and
preparing
to
leave
the
gentlemen
to
their
own
affairs
we
shall
see
you
at
dinner
at
six
she
said
with
a
constrained
little
smile
to
mr
proctor
and
went
with
her
in
her
hand
without
taking
any
special
notice
of
the
rector
mr
leeson
was
to
come
to
dinner
that
day
legitimately
by
invitation
and
mrs
morgan
who
felt
it
would
be
a
little
consolation
to
disappoint
the
hungry
curate
for
once
was
making
up
her
mind
as
she
went
not
to
have
the
pudding
of
which
he
showed
so
high
an
appreciation
it
almost
seemed
to
her
as
if
this
spark
of
was
receiving
a
summary
chastisement
when
she
heard
steps
ascending
behind
her
mrs
morgan
objected
to
have
men
lounging
about
her
in
the
morning
she
thought
mr
proctor
was
coming
to
bestow
a
little
more
of
his
confidence
upon
her
and
perhaps
to
consult
her
about
his
furnishing
and
being
occupied
by
her
own
troubles
she
had
no
patience
for
a
tiresome
lover
who
no
doubt
was
going
to
disappoint
and
disenchant
another
woman
she
sat
down
accordingly
with
a
sigh
of
impatience
at
her
turning
her
back
to
the
door
perhaps
when
he
saw
her
inhospitable
attitude
he
might
go
away
and
not
bother
her
and
mrs
morgan
took
out
some
stockings
to
darn
as
being
a
discontented
occupation
and
was
considering
within
herself
what
simple
preparation
she
could
have
instead
of
the
pudding
when
looking
up
suddenly
she
saw
not
mr
proctor
but
the
rector
standing
looking
down
upon
her
within
a
few
steps
of
her
chair
when
she
perceived
him
it
was
not
in
nature
to
refrain
from
certain
symptoms
of
agitation
the
thoughts
she
had
been
indulging
in
brought
suddenly
a
rush
of
guilty
colour
to
her
face
but
she
commanded
herself
as
well
as
she
could
and
went
on
darning
her
stockings
with
her
heart
beating
very
loud
in
her
breast
my
dear
said
the
rector
taking
a
seat
near
her
i
do
know
what
it
is
that
has
risen
between
us
we
look
as
if
we
had
quarrelled
and
i
thought
we
had
made
up
our
minds
never
to
quarrel
the
words
were
rather
soft
in
their
signification
but
mr
morgan
could
not
help
speaking
severely
as
was
natural
to
his
voice
which
was
perhaps
in
the
present
case
all
the
better
for
his
wife
i
do
know
what
you
may
consider
quarrelling
william
said
mrs
morgan
but
i
am
sure
i
have
never
made
any
complaint
no
said
the
rector
i
have
seen
women
do
that
before
you
make
any
complaint
but
you
look
as
if
you
disapproved
of
everything
i
feel
it
all
the
more
just
now
because
i
want
to
consult
you
and
after
all
the
occasion
was
no
such
i
never
said
there
was
any
occasion
i
am
sure
i
never
made
any
complaint
you
said
you
wanted
to
consult
me
william
mrs
morgan
went
on
darning
her
stockings
while
she
was
speaking
and
the
rector
like
most
other
men
objected
to
be
spoken
to
by
the
lips
only
he
would
have
liked
to
toss
the
stocking
out
of
the
window
though
it
was
his
own
and
the
task
of
repairing
it
was
one
of
a
devoted
first
duties
according
to
the
code
of
female
proprieties
in
which
both
the
husband
and
wife
had
been
brought
up
yes
said
the
rector
with
a
sigh
the
truth
is
i
have
just
got
a
letter
from
harry
scarsfield
who
was
my
pet
pupil
long
ago
he
tells
me
my
father
old
rectory
is
vacant
where
we
were
all
brought
up
there
used
to
be
a
constant
intercourse
between
the
hall
and
the
rectory
when
i
was
a
lad
they
are
very
nice
people
the
scarsfields
at
least
they
used
to
be
very
nice
people
and
harry
has
his
mother
living
with
him
and
the
family
has
never
been
broken
up
i
believe
we
used
to
know
everybody
about
there
said
mr
morgan
abandoning
himself
to
recollections
in
a
manner
most
mysterious
to
his
wife
there
is
the
letter
my
dear
and
he
put
it
down
upon
her
table
and
began
to
play
with
the
reels
of
cotton
in
her
workbox
unconsciously
as
he
had
not
done
for
a
long
time
which
unawares
to
herself
had
a
softening
influence
upon
mrs
morgan
heart
i
do
not
know
anything
about
the
scarsfields
she
said
without
taking
up
the
letter
and
i
can
not
see
what
you
have
to
do
with
this
does
he
wish
you
to
recommend
some
one
mrs
morgan
added
with
a
momentary
interest
for
she
had
of
course
like
other
people
a
relation
in
a
poor
living
whom
it
would
have
been
satisfactory
to
recommend
he
says
i
may
have
it
if
i
have
a
mind
said
the
rector
curtly
betraying
a
little
aggravation
in
his
tone
you
william
said
mrs
morgan
she
was
so
much
surprised
that
she
laid
down
her
stocking
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
which
she
had
not
done
for
many
days
and
it
was
wonderful
how
hard
she
found
it
to
keep
up
her
reserve
after
having
once
looked
her
husband
in
the
eyes
but
it
is
not
much
more
than
six
months
since
you
were
settled
in
carlingford
she
said
still
lost
in
amazement
you
can
not
possibly
mean
to
make
a
change
so
soon
and
then
the
difference
of
the
position
said
the
rector
wife
as
she
looked
at
him
she
became
more
and
more
aware
of
some
meaning
in
his
face
which
she
did
not
understand
and
more
and
more
as
it
became
necessary
to
understand
him
the
reserves
and
of
the
first
quarrel
gave
way
and
dispersed
i
do
think
i
quite
know
what
you
mean
she
said
faltering
a
little
i
do
understand
why
you
should
think
of
a
change
a
good
country
living
is
a
very
good
position
said
the
rector
it
is
not
nearly
so
troublesome
as
a
town
like
carlingford
there
is
no
dissent
that
i
know
of
and
no
here
mr
morgan
paused
for
a
moment
not
knowing
what
word
to
use
no
disturbing
influences
of
course
i
would
not
take
such
a
step
without
your
concurrence
my
dear
the
rector
continued
and
then
there
followed
a
bewildering
pause
mrs
morgan
first
sensation
after
the
astonishment
with
which
she
heard
this
strange
proposal
was
mortification
the
vivid
shame
and
vexation
of
a
woman
when
she
is
obliged
to
own
to
herself
that
her
husband
has
been
worsted
and
is
retiring
from
the
field
if
you
think
it
right
if
you
think
it
best
of
course
i
can
have
nothing
to
say
said
the
rector
wife
and
she
took
up
her
stocking
with
a
stinging
sense
of
discomfiture
she
had
meant
that
her
husband
should
be
the
first
man
in
carlingford
that
he
should
gain
respect
and
veneration
and
become
the
ideal
of
that
favourite
and
fortunate
place
every
kind
of
good
work
and
benevolent
undertaking
was
to
be
connected
with
his
name
according
to
the
visions
which
mrs
morgan
had
framed
when
she
came
first
to
carlingford
not
without
such
a
participation
on
her
own
part
as
should
entitle
her
to
the
milder
glory
appertaining
to
the
good
rector
wife
all
these
hopes
were
now
to
be
blotted
out
ignominiously
defeat
and
retreat
and
failure
were
to
be
the
conclusion
of
their
first
essay
at
life
you
are
the
best
judge
of
what
you
ought
to
do
she
said
with
as
much
calmness
as
she
could
muster
but
she
could
have
dropped
bitter
tears
upon
the
stocking
she
was
mending
if
that
would
have
done
any
good
i
will
do
nothing
without
your
consent
said
the
rector
young
wentworth
is
going
to
stay
in
carlingford
you
need
not
look
up
so
sharply
as
if
you
were
vexed
to
think
had
anything
to
do
with
it
if
he
had
not
behaved
like
a
fool
i
never
could
have
been
led
into
such
a
mistake
said
mr
morgan
with
indignation
taking
a
little
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
to
refresh
himself
at
the
same
time
said
the
rector
severely
coming
back
after
a
pause
to
show
any
would
be
very
unchristian
either
on
your
side
or
mine
if
i
were
to
accept
harry
scarsfield
offer
proctor
and
i
would
do
all
we
could
to
have
young
wentworth
appointed
to
carlingford
there
is
nobody
just
now
at
to
take
the
living
and
however
much
you
may
disapprove
of
him
my
dear
said
mr
morgan
with
increasing
severity
there
is
nothing
that
i
know
to
be
said
against
him
as
a
clergyman
if
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
consent
to
it
and
can
see
affairs
in
the
same
light
as
they
appear
to
me
that
is
what
i
intend
to
do
mrs
morgan
stocking
had
dropped
on
her
knees
as
she
listened
then
it
dropped
on
the
floor
and
she
took
no
notice
of
it
when
the
rector
had
finally
delivered
himself
of
his
sentiments
which
he
did
in
the
voice
of
a
judge
who
was
condemning
some
unfortunate
to
the
utmost
penalties
of
the
law
his
wife
marked
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
by
a
sob
of
strange
excitement
she
kept
gazing
at
him
for
a
few
moments
without
feeling
able
to
speak
and
then
she
put
down
her
face
into
her
hands
words
were
too
feeble
to
give
utterance
to
her
feelings
at
such
a
supreme
moment
oh
william
i
wonder
if
you
can
ever
forgive
me
sobbed
the
rector
wife
with
a
depth
of
compunction
which
he
good
man
was
totally
unprepared
to
meet
and
knew
no
occasion
for
he
was
even
at
the
moment
a
little
puzzled
to
have
such
a
despairing
petition
addressed
to
him
i
hope
so
my
dear
he
said
very
sedately
as
he
came
and
sat
down
beside
her
and
could
not
refrain
from
uttering
a
little
lecture
upon
temper
which
fortunately
mrs
morgan
was
too
much
excited
to
pay
any
attention
to
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
if
you
did
not
give
way
to
your
feelings
said
the
rector
but
in
the
mean
time
my
dear
it
is
your
advice
i
want
for
we
must
not
take
such
a
step
unadvisedly
and
he
lifted
up
the
stocking
that
had
fallen
and
contemplated
not
without
surprise
the
emotion
of
his
wife
the
excellent
man
was
as
entirely
unconscious
that
he
was
being
put
up
again
at
that
moment
with
acclamations
upon
his
pedestal
as
that
he
had
at
a
former
time
been
violently
displaced
from
it
and
thrown
into
the
category
of
broken
idols
all
this
would
have
been
as
sanscrit
to
the
rector
of
carlingford
and
the
only
resource
he
had
was
to
make
in
his
own
mind
certain
remarks
upon
the
inexplicable
weakness
of
women
and
to
pick
up
the
stocking
which
his
wife
was
darning
and
finally
to
stroke
her
hair
which
was
still
as
pretty
and
soft
and
brown
as
it
had
been
ten
years
ago
under
such
circumstances
a
man
does
not
object
to
feel
himself
on
a
platform
of
moral
superiority
he
even
began
to
pet
her
a
little
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
forgiveness
and
forbearance
you
were
perhaps
a
little
cross
my
love
but
you
do
think
i
am
the
man
to
be
hard
upon
you
said
the
rector
now
you
must
dry
your
eyes
and
give
me
your
advice
you
know
how
much
confidence
i
have
always
had
in
your
advice
forgive
me
william
i
do
think
there
is
any
one
so
good
as
you
are
and
as
long
as
we
are
together
it
does
not
matter
to
me
where
we
are
said
the
repentant
woman
but
as
she
lifted
up
her
head
her
eye
fell
on
the
carpet
and
a
gleam
of
sudden
delight
passed
through
mrs
mind
to
be
delivered
from
all
her
suspicions
and
injurious
thoughts
about
her
husband
would
have
been
a
deliverance
great
enough
for
one
day
but
at
the
same
happy
moment
to
see
a
means
of
deliverance
from
the
smaller
as
well
as
the
greater
cross
of
her
existence
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
credible
she
brightened
up
immediately
when
that
thought
occurred
to
her
i
think
it
is
the
very
best
thing
you
could
do
she
said
we
are
both
so
fond
of
the
country
and
it
is
so
much
nicer
to
manage
a
country
parish
than
a
town
one
we
might
have
lived
all
our
lives
in
carlingford
without
knowing
above
half
of
the
poor
people
said
mrs
morgan
growing
in
warmth
as
she
went
on
it
is
so
different
in
a
country
parish
i
never
liked
to
say
anything
she
continued
with
subtle
feminine
policy
but
i
never
much
cared
for
carlingford
she
gave
a
sigh
as
she
spoke
for
she
thought
of
the
virginian
creeper
and
the
five
feet
of
new
wall
at
that
side
of
the
garden
which
had
just
been
completed
to
shut
out
the
view
of
the
train
life
does
not
contain
any
perfect
pleasure
but
when
mrs
morgan
stooped
to
lift
up
some
stray
reels
of
cotton
which
the
rector
clumsy
fingers
had
dropped
out
of
her
workbox
her
eye
was
again
attracted
by
the
gigantic
roses
and
tulips
on
the
carpet
and
content
and
satisfaction
filled
her
heart
i
have
felt
the
same
thing
my
dear
said
mr
morgan
i
do
say
anything
against
mr
finial
as
an
architect
but
scott
himself
could
make
nothing
of
such
a
hideous
church
i
do
suppose
wentworth
will
mind
said
the
rector
with
a
curious
sense
of
superiority
he
felt
his
own
magnanimous
conduct
at
the
moment
almost
as
much
as
his
wife
had
done
and
could
not
help
regarding
carlingford
church
as
the
which
was
not
to
be
examined
too
closely
in
the
mouth
no
said
mrs
morgan
not
without
a
passing
sensation
of
doubt
on
this
point
if
he
had
only
been
frank
and
explained
everything
there
never
could
have
been
any
mistake
but
i
am
glad
it
has
all
happened
said
the
rector
wife
with
a
little
enthusiasm
oh
william
i
have
been
such
a
wretch
i
have
been
thinking
but
now
you
are
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
his
head
she
cried
with
a
hysterical
sound
in
her
throat
it
was
no
matter
to
her
that
she
herself
scarcely
knew
what
she
meant
and
that
the
good
rector
had
not
the
faintest
understanding
of
it
she
was
so
glad
that
it
was
almost
necessary
to
be
guilty
of
some
extravagance
by
way
of
relieving
her
mind
after
all
mr
care
in
fitting
the
furniture
you
would
not
of
course
think
of
removing
it
said
mrs
morgan
mr
wentworth
will
take
it
as
we
did
and
as
for
mrs
scarsfield
if
you
like
her
william
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
the
penitent
wife
said
softly
in
the
flutter
and
tremor
of
her
agitation
as
he
saw
himself
reflected
in
her
eyes
the
rector
could
not
but
feel
himself
a
superior
person
elevated
over
other
men
shoulders
such
a
sense
of
goodness
promotes
the
amiability
from
which
it
springs
the
rector
kissed
his
wife
as
he
got
up
from
his
seat
beside
her
and
once
more
smoothed
down
with
a
touch
which
made
her
feel
like
a
girl
again
her
pretty
brown
hair
that
is
all
settled
satisfactorily
said
mr
morgan
and
now
i
must
go
to
my
work
again
i
thought
if
you
approved
of
it
i
would
write
at
once
to
scarsfield
and
also
to
buller
of
do
said
the
rector
wife
and
she
too
bestowed
in
her
way
a
little
caress
which
was
far
from
being
unpleasant
to
the
man
he
went
in
a
more
agreeable
frame
of
mind
than
he
had
known
for
a
long
time
back
not
that
he
understood
why
she
had
cried
about
it
when
he
laid
his
intentions
before
her
had
mr
morgan
been
a
frenchman
he
probably
would
have
imagined
his
heart
to
be
touched
by
the
graces
of
the
perpetual
curate
but
being
an
englishman
and
rather
more
certain
on
the
whole
of
her
than
of
himself
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
speculate
on
the
subject
he
was
quite
able
to
content
himself
with
the
thought
that
women
were
incomprehensible
as
he
went
back
to
his
study
to
be
sure
it
was
best
to
understand
them
if
you
could
but
if
not
it
did
not
so
very
much
matter
mr
morgan
thought
could
in
this
pleasant
condition
of
mind
he
went
and
wrote
a
little
sermon
which
ever
after
was
a
great
favourite
preached
upon
all
special
occasions
and
always
listened
to
with
satisfaction
especially
by
the
rector
wife
when
mrs
morgan
was
left
alone
she
sat
doing
nothing
for
an
entire
thinking
of
the
strange
and
change
that
in
a
moment
had
occurred
to
her
though
she
was
not
young
she
had
that
sense
of
grievousness
the
unbearableness
of
trouble
which
belongs
to
youth
for
after
all
whatever
female
moralists
may
say
on
the
subject
the
patience
of
an
unmarried
woman
wearing
out
her
youth
in
the
harassments
of
a
long
engagement
is
something
very
different
from
the
hard
and
experience
of
actual
life
she
had
been
accustomed
for
years
to
think
that
her
troubles
would
be
over
when
the
event
arrived
and
when
new
and
more
vexatious
troubles
still
sprang
up
after
that
event
the
woman
of
one
idea
was
not
much
better
fitted
to
meet
them
than
if
she
had
been
a
girl
now
that
the
momentary
cloud
had
been
driven
off
mrs
morgan
heart
rose
more
warmly
than
ever
she
changed
her
mind
in
a
moment
about
the
pudding
and
even
added
in
her
imagination
another
dish
to
the
dinner
without
pausing
to
think
that
also
was
much
approved
by
mr
leeson
and
then
her
thoughts
took
another
turn
and
such
a
vision
of
a
perfect
carpet
for
a
something
softer
and
more
exquisite
than
ever
came
out
of
mortal
loom
full
of
repose
and
tranquillity
yet
not
without
seducing
beauties
of
design
a
carpet
which
would
never
obtrude
itself
but
yet
would
catch
the
eye
by
dreamy
moments
in
the
summer
twilight
or
over
the
winter
fire
flashed
upon
the
imagination
of
the
rector
wife
it
would
be
sweet
to
have
a
house
of
one
own
arranging
where
everything
would
be
in
harmony
and
though
this
sweetness
was
very
secondary
to
the
other
satisfaction
of
having
a
husband
who
was
not
a
clay
idol
but
really
deserved
his
pedestal
it
yet
supplemented
the
larger
delight
and
rounded
off
all
the
corners
of
mrs
morgan
present
desires
she
wished
everybody
as
happy
as
herself
in
the
effusion
of
the
moment
and
thought
of
lucy
wodehouse
with
a
little
glow
of
friendliness
in
which
there
was
still
a
tincture
of
admiring
envy
all
this
that
happy
girl
would
have
without
the
necessity
of
waiting
for
it
but
then
was
it
not
the
rector
the
rehabilitated
husband
who
would
be
the
means
of
producing
so
much
happiness
mrs
morgan
rose
up
as
lightly
as
a
girl
when
she
had
reached
this
stage
and
opened
her
which
was
one
of
her
and
too
fine
to
be
used
on
common
occasions
she
took
out
her
prettiest
paper
with
her
monogram
in
violet
which
was
her
favourite
colour
one
of
those
kind
impulses
which
are
born
of
happiness
moved
her
relieved
spirit
to
give
to
another
the
consolation
of
a
brighter
hope
seemed
at
the
moment
the
most
natural
way
of
expressing
her
own
thankful
feelings
instead
of
going
immediately
to
order
dinner
she
sat
down
instead
at
the
table
and
wrote
the
following
note
my
dear
mr
wentworth
i
do
know
whether
you
will
think
me
a
friend
seeking
you
only
when
everybody
else
is
seeking
you
and
when
you
are
no
longer
in
want
of
support
and
sympathy
perhaps
you
will
exculpate
me
when
you
remember
the
last
conversation
we
had
but
what
i
write
for
at
present
is
to
ask
if
you
would
waive
ceremony
and
come
to
dinner
with
us
i
am
aware
that
your
family
are
still
in
carlingford
and
of
course
i
do
know
what
engagements
you
may
have
but
if
you
are
at
liberty
pray
come
if
mr
morgan
and
you
had
but
known
each
other
a
little
better
things
could
never
have
happened
which
have
been
a
great
grief
and
vexation
to
me
and
i
know
the
rector
very
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
you
and
has
something
to
speak
of
in
which
you
would
be
interested
perhaps
my
husband
might
feel
a
little
strange
in
asking
you
to
overstep
the
barrier
which
somehow
has
been
raised
between
you
two
but
i
am
sure
if
you
knew
each
other
better
you
would
understand
each
other
and
this
is
one
of
the
things
we
women
ought
to
be
good
for
i
will
take
it
as
a
proof
that
you
consider
me
a
friend
if
you
accept
my
invitation
our
hour
is
believe
me
very
sincerely
yours
m
morgan
when
she
had
written
this
note
mrs
morgan
went
stopping
at
the
library
door
in
passing
i
thought
i
might
as
well
ask
mr
wentworth
to
come
to
us
as
we
are
to
have
some
people
to
dinner
she
said
looking
in
at
the
door
i
thought
you
might
like
to
talk
to
him
william
and
if
his
people
are
going
away
i
daresay
he
will
feel
rather
lonely
such
was
the
jesuitical
aspect
in
which
she
represented
the
flag
of
truce
she
was
sending
mr
morgan
was
a
little
startled
by
action
so
prompt
i
should
like
to
hear
from
buller
first
said
the
rector
he
might
like
to
come
to
carlingford
himself
for
anything
i
can
tell
but
to
be
sure
it
can
do
no
harm
to
have
wentworth
to
dinner
said
mr
morgan
doubtfully
only
buller
you
know
might
wish
and
in
that
case
it
might
not
be
worth
our
trouble
to
make
any
change
in
spite
of
herself
mrs
morgan
countenance
fell
her
pretty
scheme
of
poetic
justice
her
vision
of
tasteful
and
appropriate
furniture
became
obscured
by
a
momentary
mist
at
least
it
is
only
right
to
ask
him
to
dinner
she
said
in
subdued
tones
and
went
to
speak
to
the
cook
in
a
frame
of
mind
more
like
the
common
level
of
human
satisfaction
than
the
exultant
and
exalted
strain
to
which
she
had
risen
at
the
first
moment
then
she
put
on
a
black
dress
and
went
to
call
on
the
miss
wodehouses
who
naturally
came
into
her
mind
when
she
thought
of
the
perpetual
curate
as
she
went
along
grange
lane
she
could
not
but
observe
a
hackney
cab
one
of
those
which
belong
to
the
railway
station
lounging
if
a
cab
could
ever
be
said
to
lounge
in
the
direction
of
wharfside
its
appearance
specially
attracted
mrs
morgan
attention
in
consequence
of
the
apparition
of
favourite
who
now
and
then
poked
his
head
furtively
through
the
window
and
seemed
to
be
sitting
in
state
inside
when
she
had
gone
a
little
further
she
encountered
wodehouse
and
jack
wentworth
who
had
just
come
from
paying
their
visit
to
the
sisters
the
sight
of
these
two
revived
her
sympathies
for
the
lonely
women
who
had
fallen
so
unexpectedly
out
of
wealth
into
poverty
but
yet
she
felt
a
little
difficulty
in
framing
her
countenance
to
be
partly
sorrowful
and
partly
congratulatory
as
was
necessary
under
these
circumstances
for
though
she
knew
nothing
of
the
accident
which
had
happened
that
morning
when
lucy
and
the
perpetual
curate
saw
each
other
alone
she
was
aware
of
miss
wodehouse
special
position
and
was
sympathetic
as
became
a
woman
who
had
gone
through
similar
experiences
when
she
had
got
through
her
visit
and
was
going
home
it
struck
her
with
considerable
surprise
to
see
the
cab
still
lingering
about
the
corner
of
prickett
lane
was
elsworthy
pet
boy
delivering
his
newspapers
from
that
dignified
elevation
or
were
they
seizing
the
opportunity
of
conveying
away
the
unfortunate
little
girl
who
had
caused
so
much
annoyance
to
everybody
when
she
went
closer
with
a
little
natural
curiosity
to
see
what
else
might
be
inside
besides
the
furtive
the
cab
made
a
little
rush
away
from
her
and
the
blinds
were
drawn
down
mrs
morgan
smiled
a
little
to
herself
with
dignified
calm
as
if
it
was
anything
to
me
she
said
to
herself
and
so
went
home
to
put
out
the
dessert
with
her
own
hands
she
even
cut
a
few
fronds
of
her
favourite
maidenhair
to
decorate
the
peaches
of
which
she
could
not
help
being
a
little
proud
i
must
speak
to
mr
wentworth
if
he
comes
to
keep
on
thompson
she
said
to
herself
and
then
gave
a
momentary
sigh
at
the
thought
of
the
new
flue
which
was
as
good
as
her
own
invention
and
which
it
had
cost
her
both
time
and
money
to
arrange
to
her
satisfaction
the
peaches
were
lovely
but
who
could
tell
what
they
might
be
next
year
if
a
new
rector
came
who
took
no
interest
in
the
garden
for
thomson
though
he
was
a
very
good
servant
required
to
be
looked
after
as
indeed
most
good
servants
do
mrs
morgan
sighed
a
little
when
she
thought
of
all
her
past
exertions
and
the
pains
of
which
she
was
scarcely
yet
beginning
to
reap
the
fruit
one
man
labours
and
another
enters
into
his
labours
one
thing
however
was
a
little
consolatory
that
she
could
take
her
ferns
with
her
but
on
the
whole
after
the
first
outburst
of
feeling
the
idea
of
change
notwithstanding
all
its
advantages
was
in
itself
like
most
human
things
a
doubtful
pleasure
to
be
sure
it
was
only
through
its
products
that
her
feelings
were
interested
about
the
new
flue
whereas
the
carpet
was
a
standing
grievance
when
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
the
rector
wife
was
not
nearly
so
sure
as
before
that
she
had
never
liked
carlingford
she
began
to
forget
the
thoughts
she
had
entertained
about
broken
idols
and
to
remember
a
number
of
inconveniences
attending
a
removal
who
would
guarantee
the
safe
transit
of
the
china
not
to
speak
of
the
china
which
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
decorations
of
the
rectory
this
kind
of
breakage
if
not
more
real
was
at
least
likely
to
force
itself
more
upon
the
senses
than
the
other
kind
of
fracture
which
this
explanation
had
happily
averted
and
altogether
it
was
with
mingled
feelings
that
mrs
morgan
entered
the
and
found
it
occupied
by
mr
leeson
who
always
came
too
early
and
who
on
the
present
occasion
had
some
sufficiently
strange
news
to
tell
chapter
xlvi
mr
wentworth
did
not
accept
mrs
morgan
sudden
invitation
partly
because
his
people
did
not
leave
carlingford
that
evening
and
partly
because
though
quite
amiably
disposed
towards
the
rector
whom
he
had
worsted
in
fair
fight
he
was
not
sufficiently
interested
in
anything
he
was
likely
to
hear
or
see
in
mr
morgan
house
to
move
him
to
spend
his
evening
there
he
returned
a
very
civil
answer
to
the
invitation
of
the
rector
wife
thanking
her
warmly
for
her
friendliness
and
explaining
that
he
could
not
leave
his
father
on
the
last
night
of
his
stay
in
carlingford
after
which
he
went
to
dinner
at
his
aunts
where
the
household
was
still
much
agitated
not
to
speak
of
all
the
events
which
had
happened
and
were
happening
jack
who
had
begun
to
tire
of
his
new
character
of
the
repentant
prodigal
had
shown
himself
in
a
new
light
that
evening
and
was
preparing
to
leave
to
the
relief
of
all
parties
the
prodigal
who
no
longer
pretended
to
be
penitent
had
taken
the
conversation
into
his
own
hands
at
dinner
i
have
had
things
my
own
way
since
i
came
here
said
jack
somehow
it
appears
i
have
a
great
luck
for
having
things
my
own
way
it
is
you
scrupulous
people
who
think
of
others
and
of
such
antiquated
stuff
as
duty
and
so
forth
that
get
yourselves
into
difficulties
my
dear
aunt
i
am
going
away
if
i
were
to
remain
an
inmate
of
this
house
i
mean
to
say
could
i
look
forward
to
the
privilege
of
continuing
a
member
of
this
christian
family
another
day
i
should
know
better
how
to
conduct
myself
but
i
am
going
back
to
my
bad
courses
aunt
dora
i
am
returning
to
the
world
oh
jack
my
dear
i
hope
not
said
aunt
dora
who
was
much
bewildered
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
too
true
said
the
relapsed
sinner
and
considering
all
the
lessons
you
have
taught
me
do
you
think
it
is
the
best
thing
i
could
do
there
is
my
brother
frank
who
has
been
carrying
other
people
about
on
his
shoulders
and
doing
his
duty
but
i
do
see
that
you
good
people
are
at
all
moved
in
his
behalf
you
leave
him
to
fight
his
way
by
himself
and
confer
your
benefits
elsewhere
which
is
an
odd
sort
of
lesson
for
a
worldling
like
me
as
for
gerald
you
know
he
a
virtuous
fool
as
i
have
heard
you
all
declare
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
i
can
see
to
prevent
him
keeping
his
living
and
doing
as
he
pleases
as
most
parsons
do
however
that
his
own
business
it
is
frank
case
which
is
the
edifying
case
to
me
if
my
convictions
of
sin
had
gone
just
a
step
farther
said
the
pitiless
critic
if
i
had
devoted
myself
to
bringing
others
to
repentance
as
is
the
first
duty
of
a
reformed
sinner
my
aunt
leonora
would
not
have
hesitated
to
give
skelmersdale
to
me
jack
hold
your
tongue
said
miss
leonora
but
though
her
cheeks
burned
her
voice
was
not
so
firm
as
usual
and
she
actually
failed
in
putting
down
the
man
who
had
determined
to
have
his
say
fact
my
dear
aunt
said
jack
if
i
had
been
a
greater
rascal
than
i
am
and
gone
a
little
farther
you
and
your
people
would
have
thought
me
quite
fit
for
a
cure
of
souls
i
have
come
in
for
your
good
things
that
way
as
well
as
other
ways
but
here
is
frank
who
even
i
can
see
is
a
right
sort
of
parson
i
do
pretend
to
fixed
theological
opinions
said
this
oracle
with
a
comic
glance
aside
at
gerald
the
most
unlikely
person
present
to
make
any
response
but
so
far
as
i
can
see
he
a
kind
of
fellow
most
men
would
be
glad
to
make
a
friend
of
when
they
were
under
a
cloud
not
that
he
was
ever
very
civil
to
me
i
tell
you
so
far
from
rewarding
him
for
being
of
the
true
sort
you
do
nothing
but
snub
him
that
i
can
see
he
looks
to
me
as
good
for
work
as
any
man
i
know
but
you
give
your
livings
to
any
kind
of
wretched
before
you
give
them
to
frank
i
am
aware
said
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
with
a
momentary
flush
that
i
have
never
been
considered
much
of
a
credit
to
the
family
but
if
i
were
to
announce
my
intention
of
marrying
and
settling
there
is
not
one
of
the
name
that
would
not
lend
a
hand
to
smooth
matters
that
is
the
reward
of
wickedness
said
jack
with
a
laugh
as
for
frank
he
a
perpetual
curate
and
may
marry
perhaps
fifty
years
hence
that
the
way
you
good
people
treat
a
man
who
never
did
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
in
his
life
and
you
expect
me
to
give
up
my
evil
courses
after
such
a
lesson
i
trust
i
am
not
such
a
fool
said
the
relapsed
prodigal
he
sat
looking
at
them
all
in
his
easy
way
enjoying
the
confusion
the
indignation
and
wrath
with
which
his
address
was
received
the
man
who
gets
his
own
way
is
the
man
who
takes
it
he
concluded
with
his
usual
composure
pouring
out
miss
leonora
glass
of
claret
as
he
spoke
nobody
had
ever
before
seen
the
woman
in
so
much
agitation
frank
knows
what
my
feelings
are
she
said
abruptly
i
have
a
great
respect
for
himself
but
i
have
no
confidence
in
his
principles
i
i
have
explained
my
ideas
about
church
patronage
but
here
the
squire
broke
in
i
always
said
sir
said
the
old
man
with
an
unsteady
voice
that
if
i
ever
lived
to
see
a
thing
or
two
amended
that
was
undoubtedly
objectionable
your
brother
jack
advice
would
be
invaluable
to
the
family
as
a
as
a
man
of
the
world
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
clergymen
sir
continued
the
squire
without
it
being
apparent
whom
he
was
addressing
but
i
have
always
expressed
my
conviction
of
of
the
value
of
your
brother
jack
advice
as
as
a
man
of
the
world
this
speech
had
a
wonderful
effect
upon
the
assembled
family
but
most
of
all
upon
the
son
thus
commended
who
lost
all
his
ease
and
composure
as
his
father
spoke
and
turned
his
head
stiffly
to
one
side
as
if
afraid
to
meet
the
squire
eyes
which
indeed
were
not
seeking
his
but
were
fixed
upon
the
table
as
was
natural
considering
the
state
of
emotion
in
which
mr
wentworth
was
as
for
jack
when
he
had
steadied
himself
a
little
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
tried
to
laugh
though
the
effort
was
far
from
being
a
successful
one
even
my
father
applauds
me
you
see
because
i
am
a
scamp
and
deserve
it
he
said
with
a
voice
which
was
partially
choked
sir
i
am
going
away
the
squire
rose
too
with
the
hazy
bewildered
look
of
which
his
other
children
were
afraid
sir
said
the
old
man
and
then
made
a
pause
before
he
held
out
his
hand
you
not
forget
what
i
said
jack
he
added
with
a
little
haste
it
true
enough
though
i
have
that
confidence
in
you
that
that
i
might
have
had
i
am
getting
old
and
i
have
had
two
attacks
sir
said
mr
wentworth
with
dignity
and
anyhow
i
ca
live
for
ever
your
brothers
can
make
their
own
way
in
the
world
but
i
have
saved
all
that
i
could
have
wished
when
i
am
gone
jack
be
just
to
the
girls
and
the
little
children
said
the
squire
and
with
that
took
his
son
hand
and
grasped
it
hard
and
looked
his
heir
full
in
the
face
jack
wentworth
was
not
prepared
for
any
such
appeal
he
was
still
less
prepared
to
discover
the
unexpected
and
inevitable
sequence
with
which
one
good
sentiment
leads
to
another
he
quite
faltered
and
broke
down
in
this
emergency
father
he
said
unawares
for
the
first
time
for
ten
years
if
you
wish
it
i
will
join
you
in
breaking
the
entail
no
such
thing
sir
said
the
squire
who
so
far
from
being
pleased
was
irritated
and
disturbed
by
the
proposal
i
ask
you
to
do
your
duty
sir
and
not
to
shirk
it
the
head
of
the
house
said
with
natural
vehemence
as
he
stood
with
that
circle
of
wentworths
round
him
giving
forth
his
code
of
honour
to
his
unworthy
heir
while
his
father
was
speaking
jack
recovered
a
little
from
his
momentary
sir
i
hope
you
live
a
hundred
years
he
said
wringing
his
father
hand
if
you
last
out
of
me
as
you
ought
to
do
but
i
rather
not
anticipate
such
a
change
in
that
case
the
prodigal
went
on
with
a
certain
huskiness
in
his
voice
i
daresay
i
should
not
turn
out
so
great
a
rascal
as
as
i
ought
to
do
and
yesterday
it
has
even
occurred
to
me
by
moments
that
i
was
your
son
sir
said
jack
wentworth
and
then
he
made
an
abrupt
stop
and
dropped
the
hand
and
came
to
himself
in
a
surprising
way
when
he
turned
towards
the
rest
of
the
family
he
was
in
perfect
possession
of
his
usual
courtesy
and
good
spirits
he
nodded
to
them
all
round
with
superb
all
of
you
i
wish
you
better
luck
frank
and
not
so
much
virtue
perhaps
you
will
have
a
better
chance
now
the
lost
sheep
has
gone
back
to
the
wilderness
to
you
all
i
think
i
any
other
last
words
to
say
he
lighted
his
cigar
with
his
ordinary
composure
in
the
hall
and
whistled
one
of
his
favourite
airs
as
he
went
through
the
garden
oddly
enough
however
our
friend
wodehouse
can
beat
me
in
that
he
said
with
a
smile
to
frank
who
had
followed
him
out
perhaps
in
other
things
too
who
knows
and
old
fellow
and
thus
the
heir
of
the
wentworths
disappeared
into
the
darkness
which
swallowed
him
up
and
was
seen
no
more
but
naturally
there
was
a
good
deal
of
commotion
in
the
house
miss
leonora
who
never
had
known
what
it
was
to
have
nerves
in
the
entire
course
of
her
existence
retired
to
her
own
room
with
a
headache
to
the
entire
consternation
of
the
family
she
had
been
a
woman
all
her
life
and
managed
everybody
affairs
without
being
distracted
and
hampered
in
her
career
by
those
doubts
of
her
own
wisdom
and
questions
as
to
her
own
motives
which
will
now
and
then
afflict
the
minds
of
weaker
people
when
they
have
to
decide
for
others
but
this
time
an
utterly
novel
and
unexpected
accident
had
befallen
miss
leonora
a
man
of
no
principles
at
all
had
delivered
his
opinion
upon
her
conduct
and
so
far
from
finding
his
criticism
contemptible
or
discovering
in
it
the
ordinary
outcry
of
the
wicked
against
the
righteous
she
had
found
it
true
and
by
means
of
it
had
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
her
life
seen
herself
as
others
saw
her
neither
was
the
position
in
which
she
found
herself
one
from
which
she
could
get
extricated
even
by
any
daring
arbitrary
exertion
of
will
such
as
a
woman
in
difficulties
is
sometimes
capable
of
to
be
sure
she
might
still
have
cut
the
knot
in
a
summary
feminine
way
might
have
said
no
abruptly
to
julia
trench
and
her
curate
and
after
all
have
bestowed
skelmersdale
like
any
other
prize
or
reward
of
virtue
upon
her
nephew
frank
a
step
which
miss
dora
wentworth
would
have
concluded
upon
at
once
without
any
hesitation
the
elder
sister
however
was
gifted
with
a
truer
perception
of
affairs
miss
leonora
knew
that
there
were
some
things
which
could
be
done
and
yet
could
not
be
done
a
piece
of
knowledge
difficult
to
a
woman
she
recognised
the
fact
that
she
had
committed
herself
and
got
into
a
corner
from
which
there
was
but
one
possible
egress
and
as
she
acknowledged
this
to
herself
she
saw
at
the
same
time
that
julia
trench
for
whom
she
had
been
used
to
entertain
a
contempt
as
a
clever
sort
of
girl
enough
had
managed
matters
very
cleverly
and
that
instead
of
dispensing
her
piece
of
patronage
like
an
optimist
to
the
best
she
had
in
fact
given
it
up
to
the
most
skilful
and
persevering
angler
as
any
other
woman
might
have
done
the
blow
was
bitter
and
miss
leonora
did
not
seek
to
hide
it
from
herself
not
to
say
that
the
unpleasant
discovery
was
aggravated
by
having
been
thus
pointed
out
by
jack
who
in
his
own
person
had
taken
her
in
and
cheated
his
sensible
aunt
she
felt
humbled
and
wounded
in
the
tenderest
point
to
think
that
her
reprobate
nephew
had
seen
through
her
but
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
see
through
him
and
had
been
deceived
by
his
professions
of
penitence
the
more
she
turned
it
over
in
her
mind
the
more
miss
leonora
head
ached
for
was
it
not
growing
apparent
that
she
who
prided
herself
so
much
on
her
impartial
judgment
had
been
moved
not
by
heroic
and
stoical
justice
and
the
love
of
souls
but
a
good
deal
by
prejudice
and
a
good
deal
by
skilful
artifice
and
very
little
indeed
by
that
highest
motive
which
she
called
the
glory
of
god
and
it
was
jack
who
had
set
all
this
before
her
clear
as
daylight
no
wonder
the
excellent
woman
was
disconcerted
she
went
to
bed
gloomily
with
her
headache
and
would
tolerate
no
ministrations
neither
of
nor
nor
even
of
green
tea
it
always
does
miss
dora
a
power
of
good
said
the
faithful
domestic
who
made
this
last
suggestion
but
miss
leonora
answered
only
by
turning
the
unlucky
speaker
out
of
the
room
and
locking
the
door
against
any
fresh
intrusion
miss
dora
innocent
headaches
were
articles
of
a
very
different
kind
from
this
which
proceeded
neither
from
the
heart
nor
the
digestion
but
from
the
conscience
as
miss
leonora
thought
with
possibly
a
little
aid
from
the
temper
though
she
was
less
conscious
of
that
it
was
indeed
a
long
series
of
doubts
and
qualms
and
much
internal
conflict
which
resulted
through
the
influences
of
mortification
and
humbled
in
this
ominous
and
headache
which
startled
the
entire
assembled
family
and
added
fresh
importance
to
the
general
crisis
of
wentworth
affairs
i
should
not
wonder
if
it
was
the
wentworth
complaint
said
miss
dora
with
a
sob
of
fright
to
the
renewed
and
increased
indignation
of
the
squire
i
have
already
told
you
that
the
wentworth
complaint
never
attacks
females
mr
wentworth
said
emphatically
glad
to
employ
what
sounded
like
a
contemptuous
title
for
the
inferior
sex
yes
oh
yes
but
then
leonora
is
not
exactly
what
you
would
call
a
female
said
poor
miss
dora
from
whom
an
emergency
so
unexpected
had
taken
all
her
little
wits
while
the
house
was
in
such
an
agitated
condition
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
it
could
be
very
comfortable
for
the
gentlemen
when
they
came
to
the
and
found
domestic
sovereignty
overthrown
by
a
headache
which
nobody
could
comprehend
and
chaos
reigning
in
miss
leonora
place
naturally
there
was
for
one
of
the
party
at
least
a
refuge
sweet
and
close
at
hand
to
which
his
thoughts
had
escaped
already
frank
wentworth
did
not
hesitate
to
follow
his
thoughts
against
the
long
years
when
family
bonds
make
up
all
that
is
happiest
in
life
there
must
always
be
reckoned
those
moments
of
agitation
and
revolution
during
which
the
bosom
of
a
family
is
the
most
unrestful
and
disturbing
place
in
existence
from
which
it
is
well
to
have
a
personal
refuge
and
means
of
escape
the
perpetual
curate
gave
himself
a
little
shake
and
drew
a
long
breath
as
he
emerged
from
one
green
door
in
grange
lane
and
betook
himself
to
another
he
shook
himself
clear
of
all
the
wentworth
perplexities
all
the
family
difficulties
and
doubts
and
betook
himself
into
the
paradise
which
was
altogether
his
own
and
where
there
were
no
conflicting
interests
or
differences
of
opinion
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
there
that
he
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
general
aspect
of
grange
lane
or
to
the
gossips
who
were
gathered
round
elsworthy
door
all
that
belonged
to
a
previous
stage
of
existence
at
present
he
was
full
of
the
grand
discovery
boldly
stated
by
his
brother
jack
the
man
who
gets
his
own
way
is
the
man
who
it
it
was
not
an
elevated
doctrine
or
one
that
had
hitherto
commended
itself
specially
to
the
mind
of
the
perpetual
curate
but
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
his
father
pathetic
reliance
upon
advice
as
a
man
of
the
world
as
he
laid
up
in
his
mind
the
maxim
and
felt
with
a
little
thrill
of
excitement
that
he
was
about
to
act
on
it
from
which
manner
of
stating
the
case
mr
friends
will
perceive
that
had
seized
upon
him
in
the
worst
form
for
he
was
not
going
boldly
up
to
the
new
resolution
with
his
eyes
open
but
had
resigned
himself
to
the
tide
which
was
gradually
rising
in
one
united
flux
of
love
pride
impatience
sophistry
and
inclination
which
he
watched
with
a
certain
passive
content
knowing
that
the
stormy
current
would
carry
him
away
mr
wentworth
however
reckoned
without
his
host
as
is
now
and
then
the
case
with
most
men
perpetual
curates
included
he
walked
into
the
other
which
was
occupied
only
by
two
ladies
where
the
lamp
was
burning
softly
on
the
little
table
in
the
corner
and
the
windows
half
open
admitted
the
fragrant
air
the
perfumed
breath
and
stillness
and
faint
inarticulate
noises
of
the
night
since
the
visit
of
wodehouse
in
the
morning
which
had
driven
lucy
into
her
first
fit
of
passion
an
indescribable
change
had
come
over
the
house
which
had
now
returned
to
the
possession
of
its
former
owners
and
looked
again
like
home
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
familiar
room
which
mr
wentworth
knew
so
well
for
it
was
only
when
excited
by
events
beyond
their
control
as
miss
wodehouse
said
that
the
sisters
could
forget
what
had
happened
so
lately
the
loss
which
had
made
a
revolution
in
their
world
miss
wodehouse
who
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
was
busy
and
had
in
hand
a
quantity
of
mysterious
calculations
and
lists
to
make
out
sat
at
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
with
her
desk
open
and
covered
with
long
slips
of
paper
perhaps
it
was
to
save
her
rector
the
trouble
that
the
gentle
woman
gave
herself
so
much
labour
perhaps
she
liked
putting
down
on
paper
all
the
things
that
were
indispensable
for
the
new
establishment
at
all
events
she
looked
up
only
to
give
mr
wentworth
a
smile
and
sisterly
nod
of
welcome
as
he
came
in
and
made
his
way
to
the
corner
where
lucy
sat
not
unexpectant
out
of
the
disturbed
atmosphere
he
had
just
left
the
perpetual
curate
came
softly
into
that
familiar
corner
feeling
that
he
had
suddenly
reached
his
haven
and
that
eden
itself
could
not
have
possessed
a
sweeter
peace
lucy
in
her
black
dress
with
traces
of
the
exhaustion
of
nature
in
her
face
which
was
the
loveliest
face
in
the
world
to
mr
wentworth
looked
up
and
welcomed
him
with
that
look
of
satisfaction
and
content
which
is
the
highest
compliment
one
human
creature
can
pay
to
another
his
presence
rounded
off
all
the
corners
of
existence
to
lucy
for
that
moment
at
least
and
made
the
world
complete
and
full
he
sat
down
beside
her
at
her
with
no
further
interruption
to
the
than
the
presence
of
the
kind
elder
sister
at
the
table
who
was
absorbed
in
her
lists
and
who
even
had
that
pleasant
business
been
wanting
was
dear
and
familiar
enough
to
both
to
make
her
spectatorship
just
the
sweet
restraint
which
endears
such
intercourse
all
the
more
thus
the
perpetual
curate
seated
himself
feeling
in
some
degree
master
of
the
position
and
surely
here
if
nowhere
else
in
the
world
the
young
man
was
justified
in
expecting
to
have
his
own
way
they
have
settled
about
their
marriage
said
lucy
whose
voice
was
sufficiently
audible
to
be
heard
at
the
table
where
miss
wodehouse
seized
her
pen
hastily
and
plunged
it
into
the
ink
doing
her
best
to
appear
unconscious
but
failing
sadly
in
the
attempt
mr
proctor
is
going
away
directly
to
make
everything
ready
and
the
marriage
is
to
be
on
the
of
next
month
and
ours
said
mr
wentworth
who
had
not
as
yet
approached
that
subject
lucy
knew
that
this
event
must
be
far
off
and
was
not
agitated
about
it
as
yet
on
the
contrary
she
met
his
look
sympathetically
and
with
deprecation
after
the
first
natural
blush
and
soothed
him
in
her
feminine
way
patting
softly
with
her
pretty
hand
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
nobody
knows
said
lucy
we
must
wait
and
have
patience
we
have
more
time
to
spare
than
they
have
she
added
with
a
little
laugh
we
must
wait
i
do
see
the
said
the
perpetual
curate
i
have
been
thinking
it
all
over
since
the
morning
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
always
have
to
give
in
and
wait
is
well
enough
when
it
ca
be
helped
but
i
do
see
any
reason
for
postponing
my
happiness
indefinitely
look
here
lucy
it
appears
to
me
at
present
that
there
are
only
two
classes
of
people
in
the
world
those
who
will
wait
and
those
who
wo
i
do
mean
to
enrol
myself
among
the
martyrs
the
man
who
gets
his
own
way
is
the
man
who
takes
it
i
see
any
reason
in
the
world
for
concluding
that
i
wait
lucy
wodehouse
was
a
very
good
young
woman
a
devoted
anglican
and
loyal
to
all
her
duties
but
she
had
always
been
known
to
possess
a
spark
of
spirit
and
this
rebellious
quality
came
to
a
sudden
blaze
at
so
a
speech
mr
wentworth
said
lucy
looking
the
curate
in
the
face
with
a
look
which
was
equivalent
to
making
him
a
low
curtsy
i
understood
there
were
two
people
to
be
consulted
as
to
the
must
or
must
not
and
having
entered
this
protest
she
withdrew
her
chair
a
little
farther
off
and
bestowed
her
attention
absolutely
upon
the
piece
of
needlework
in
her
hand
if
the
ground
had
suddenly
been
cut
away
underneath
frank
feet
he
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
for
to
tell
the
truth
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
that
he
himself
was
the
final
authority
on
this
point
though
to
be
sure
it
was
part
of
the
conventional
etiquette
that
the
lady
should
fix
the
day
he
sat
gazing
at
her
with
so
much
surprise
that
for
a
minute
or
two
he
could
say
nothing
lucy
i
am
not
going
to
have
you
put
yourself
on
the
other
side
he
said
at
last
there
is
not
to
be
any
opposition
between
you
and
me
that
is
as
it
may
be
said
lucy
who
was
not
mollified
you
seem
to
have
changed
your
sentiments
altogether
since
the
morning
and
there
is
no
change
in
the
circumstances
at
least
that
i
can
see
yes
there
is
a
great
change
said
the
young
man
if
i
could
have
sacrificed
myself
in
earnest
and
said
nothing
which
you
were
quite
free
to
do
interrupted
lucy
who
having
given
way
to
temper
once
found
in
herself
an
alarming
proclivity
towards
a
repetition
of
the
offence
which
i
was
quite
free
to
do
said
the
perpetual
curate
with
a
smile
but
could
not
and
did
not
all
the
same
things
are
altogether
changed
now
be
as
cross
as
you
please
you
belong
to
me
to
be
sure
i
have
no
money
i
was
not
thinking
of
that
said
the
young
lady
under
her
breath
of
course
one
has
to
think
about
it
said
mr
wentworth
but
the
question
is
whether
we
shall
be
happier
and
better
going
on
separate
in
our
usual
way
or
making
up
our
minds
to
give
up
something
for
the
comfort
of
being
together
perhaps
you
will
forgive
me
for
taking
view
of
the
question
said
the
curate
with
a
little
enthusiasm
i
have
got
tired
of
ascetic
principles
i
do
see
why
it
must
be
best
to
deny
myself
and
postpone
myself
to
other
things
and
other
people
i
begin
to
be
of
my
brother
jack
opinion
the
children
of
this
world
are
wiser
in
their
generation
than
the
children
of
light
a
man
who
will
wait
has
to
wait
providence
does
not
invariably
reward
him
after
he
has
been
tried
as
we
used
to
suppose
i
am
willing
to
be
a
poor
man
because
i
ca
help
it
but
i
am
not
willing
to
wait
and
trust
my
happiness
to
the
future
when
it
is
in
my
reach
now
said
the
unreasonable
young
man
to
whom
it
was
of
course
as
easy
as
it
was
to
lucy
to
change
the
position
of
his
chair
and
prevent
the
distance
between
them
being
increased
perhaps
he
might
have
carried
his
point
even
at
that
moment
had
not
miss
wodehouse
who
had
heard
enough
to
alarm
her
come
forward
hastily
in
a
fright
on
the
prudential
side
i
could
not
help
hearing
what
you
were
saying
said
the
elder
sister
oh
mr
wentworth
i
hope
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
trust
providence
i
am
sure
that
is
not
lucy
way
of
thinking
i
would
not
mind
and
i
am
sure
she
would
not
mind
beginning
very
quietly
but
then
you
have
nothing
next
to
nothing
neither
of
you
it
might
not
matter
just
at
the
first
said
miss
wodehouse
with
serious
looks
but
then
afterwards
you
know
and
a
vision
of
a
nursery
flashed
upon
her
mind
as
she
spoke
clergymen
always
have
such
large
families
she
said
half
out
before
she
was
aware
and
stopped
covered
with
confusion
not
daring
to
look
at
lucy
to
see
what
effect
such
a
suggestion
might
have
had
upon
her
i
mean
cried
miss
wodehouse
hurrying
on
to
cover
over
her
inadvertence
if
possible
i
have
seen
such
cases
and
a
poor
clergyman
who
has
to
think
of
the
grocer
bill
and
the
baker
bill
instead
of
his
parish
and
his
duty
there
are
some
things
you
young
people
know
a
great
deal
better
than
i
do
but
you
do
know
how
dreadful
it
is
to
see
that
here
lucy
on
her
part
was
touched
on
a
tender
point
and
interposed
for
a
man
to
be
teased
about
bills
said
the
young
housekeeper
with
flushed
cheeks
and
an
averted
countenance
it
must
be
not
his
poverty
but
his
his
wife
fault
oh
lucy
do
say
so
cried
miss
wodehouse
what
is
a
poor
woman
to
do
especially
when
she
has
no
money
of
her
own
as
you
have
and
then
the
struggling
and
getting
old
before
your
time
and
all
the
burdens
please
do
say
any
more
said
lucy
there
was
no
intention
on
on
any
side
to
drive
things
to
a
decision
as
for
me
i
have
not
a
high
opinion
of
myself
i
would
not
be
the
means
of
diminishing
comforts
said
the
spiteful
young
woman
how
can
i
be
sure
that
i
might
not
turn
out
a
very
poor
compensation
we
settled
this
morning
how
all
that
was
to
be
and
i
for
one
have
not
changed
my
mind
as
yet
said
lucy
that
was
all
the
encouragement
mr
wentworth
got
when
he
propounded
his
new
views
things
looked
easy
enough
when
he
was
alone
and
suffered
himself
to
drift
on
pleasantly
on
the
changed
and
heightened
current
of
personal
desires
and
wishes
but
it
became
apparent
to
him
after
that
evening
discussion
that
even
in
eden
itself
though
the
dew
had
not
yet
dried
on
the
leaves
it
would
be
highly
incautious
for
any
man
to
conclude
that
he
was
sure
of
having
his
own
way
the
perpetual
curate
returned
a
sadder
and
more
doubtful
man
to
mrs
hadwin
to
his
own
apartments
possibly
as
the
two
states
of
mind
so
often
go
together
a
wiser
individual
too
chapter
xlvii
the
at
the
rectory
to
which
mr
wentworth
did
not
go
was
much
less
interesting
and
agreeable
than
it
might
have
been
had
he
been
present
as
for
the
rector
and
his
wife
they
could
not
but
feel
themselves
in
a
somewhat
strange
position
having
between
them
a
secret
unsuspected
by
the
company
it
was
difficult
to
refrain
from
showing
a
certain
flagging
of
interest
in
the
question
of
the
restoration
about
which
to
be
sure
mr
finial
was
just
as
much
concerned
as
he
had
been
yesterday
though
mr
morgan
and
even
mrs
morgan
had
suffered
a
great
and
unexplainable
diminution
of
enthusiasm
and
then
mr
leeson
who
was
quite
unaware
of
the
turn
that
things
had
taken
and
who
was
much
too
obtuse
to
understand
how
the
rector
could
be
anything
but
exasperated
against
the
perpetual
curate
by
the
failure
of
the
investigation
did
all
that
he
could
to
make
himself
disagreeable
which
was
saying
a
good
deal
when
mrs
morgan
came
into
the
and
found
this
obnoxious
individual
occupying
the
most
comfortable
and
turning
over
at
his
ease
the
great
book
of
ferns
which
was
the
pet
decoration
of
the
table
her
feelings
may
be
conceived
by
any
lady
who
has
gone
through
a
similar
trial
for
mr
leeson
hands
were
not
of
the
irreproachable
purity
which
becomes
the
fingers
of
a
gentleman
when
he
goes
out
to
dinner
i
know
some
people
who
always
wear
gloves
when
they
turn
over
a
portfolio
of
prints
mrs
morgan
said
coming
to
the
curate
side
to
protect
her
book
if
possible
and
these
require
quite
as
much
care
and
she
had
to
endure
a
discussion
upon
the
subject
which
was
still
more
trying
to
her
feelings
for
mr
leeson
pretended
to
know
about
ferns
on
the
score
of
having
a
wardian
case
in
his
lodgings
which
belonged
to
his
landlady
though
in
reality
he
could
scarcely
tell
the
commonest
spleenwort
from
a
lycopodium
while
mrs
morgan
went
through
this
trial
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
she
hugged
to
her
heart
the
new
idea
of
leaving
carlingford
and
thought
to
herself
that
whatever
might
be
the
character
of
the
curate
if
there
was
one
at
scarsfield
any
change
from
mr
leeson
must
be
for
the
better
and
then
the
unfortunate
man
as
if
he
was
not
disagreeable
enough
already
began
to
entertain
his
unwilling
hostess
with
the
latest
news
there
is
quite
a
commotion
in
grange
lane
said
mr
leeson
such
constant
disturbances
must
deteriorate
the
property
you
know
of
course
whatever
one
opinion
may
be
one
must
keep
it
to
one
self
after
the
result
of
the
investigation
though
i
ca
say
have
unbounded
confidence
in
trial
by
jury
said
the
disagreeable
young
man
i
am
afraid
i
am
very
slow
of
comprehension
said
the
rector
wife
i
do
know
in
the
least
what
you
mean
about
trial
by
jury
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
put
the
book
back
on
the
table
it
is
too
heavy
for
you
to
hold
oh
it
does
matter
said
mr
leeson
i
mean
about
wentworth
of
course
when
a
man
is
popular
in
society
people
prefer
to
shut
their
eyes
i
suppose
the
matter
is
settled
for
the
present
but
you
and
i
know
better
than
to
believe
i
beg
you
will
speak
for
yourself
mr
leeson
said
mrs
morgan
with
dignity
i
have
always
had
the
highest
respect
for
mr
wentworth
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
disagreeable
curate
i
forgot
almost
all
the
ladies
are
on
mr
wentworth
side
it
appears
that
little
girl
of
elsworthy
has
disappeared
again
that
was
all
i
was
going
to
say
and
fortunately
for
the
curate
colonel
chiley
who
entered
the
room
at
the
moment
diverted
from
him
the
attention
of
the
lady
of
the
house
and
after
that
there
was
no
opportunity
of
broaching
the
subject
again
until
dinner
was
almost
over
then
it
was
perhaps
the
pudding
that
warmed
mr
leeson
soul
perhaps
he
had
taken
a
little
more
wine
than
usual
he
took
sudden
advantage
of
that
curious
little
pause
which
occurs
at
a
when
the
meal
is
concluded
and
the
fruit
considered
apparently
in
orthodox
circles
a
paradisiacal
kind
of
food
which
needs
no
blessing
alone
remains
to
be
discussed
as
soon
as
the
manner
of
thanks
from
the
foot
of
the
table
was
over
the
curate
incautiously
rushed
in
before
anybody
else
could
break
the
silence
and
delivered
his
latest
information
at
a
high
pitch
of
voice
has
anyone
heard
about
the
elsworthys
said
mr
leeson
something
fresh
has
happened
there
i
hope
your
verdict
yesterday
will
not
be
called
in
question
the
fact
is
i
believe
that
the
girl
has
been
taken
away
again
they
say
she
has
gone
and
left
a
letter
saying
that
she
is
to
be
made
a
lady
of
i
do
know
what
we
are
to
understand
by
that
there
was
some
private
service
or
other
going
on
at
st
very
early
in
the
morning
marriage
is
a
sacrament
you
know
perhaps
mr
wentworth
or
his
brother
they
are
a
queer
family
the
wentworths
said
old
mr
western
and
such
lots
of
them
sir
such
lots
of
them
the
old
ladies
seem
to
have
settled
down
here
i
am
not
of
their
way
of
thinking
you
know
but
they
very
good
to
the
poor
mr
frank
wentworth
is
going
to
succeed
his
brother
i
suppose
said
mr
leeson
it
is
very
lucky
for
a
man
who
gets
himself
talked
of
to
have
a
family
living
to
fall
back
upon
no
such
thing
no
such
thing
said
mr
proctor
hastily
mr
frank
wentworth
means
to
stay
here
dear
me
said
the
disagreeable
curate
with
an
elaborate
pause
of
astonishment
things
must
be
bad
indeed
added
that
interesting
youth
with
solemnity
shaking
the
devoted
head
upon
which
he
did
not
know
that
mrs
morgan
had
fixed
her
eyes
if
his
own
family
give
him
up
and
leave
him
to
starve
here
they
would
never
give
him
up
if
they
had
not
very
good
cause
oh
come
i
should
like
to
believe
that
know
how
much
a
curate
has
to
live
on
said
mr
leeson
with
a
smile
of
engaging
candour
before
they
give
him
up
like
that
with
two
livings
in
the
family
they
must
have
very
good
cause
very
good
cause
indeed
said
mrs
morgan
from
the
head
of
the
table
the
company
in
general
had
to
tell
the
truth
been
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
curate
observations
and
there
was
almost
the
entire
length
of
the
table
between
the
unhappy
man
and
the
avenger
so
good
a
reason
that
it
is
strange
how
it
should
not
have
occurred
to
a
brother
clergyman
that
is
the
evil
of
a
large
parish
said
the
rector
wife
with
beautiful
simplicity
however
hard
one
works
one
never
can
know
above
half
of
the
poor
people
and
i
suppose
you
have
been
occupied
in
the
other
districts
and
have
not
heard
what
a
great
work
mr
wentworth
is
doing
i
have
reason
to
know
said
mrs
morgan
with
considerable
state
that
he
will
remain
in
carlingford
in
a
very
different
position
from
that
which
he
has
filled
hitherto
mr
leeson
knows
how
much
a
curate
has
to
live
upon
but
i
am
afraid
that
is
all
he
does
know
of
such
a
life
as
mr
wentworth
mrs
morgan
paused
for
a
moment
to
get
breath
for
her
excitement
was
considerable
and
she
had
many
wrongs
to
avenge
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
curates
as
well
as
in
other
things
said
the
indignant
woman
i
have
reason
to
know
that
mr
wentworth
will
remain
in
carlingford
in
quite
a
different
position
now
and
then
even
in
this
world
things
come
right
like
a
fairy
tale
that
is
when
the
authority
is
in
the
right
hands
the
rector
wife
went
on
with
a
smile
at
her
husband
which
disarmed
that
astonished
man
perhaps
if
mr
leeson
had
the
same
inducement
as
mr
wentworth
he
too
would
make
up
his
mind
to
remain
in
carlingford
mrs
morgan
got
up
as
she
made
this
speech
with
a
rustle
and
sweep
of
drapery
which
seemed
all
addressed
to
the
unhappy
curate
who
stumbled
upon
his
feet
like
the
other
gentlemen
but
dared
not
for
his
life
have
approached
her
to
open
the
door
mr
leeson
felt
that
he
had
received
his
as
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
he
was
much
too
stunned
to
speculate
on
the
subject
or
ask
himself
what
was
going
to
happen
whatever
was
going
to
happen
there
was
an
end
of
he
had
eaten
the
last
pudding
that
he
ever
would
have
presented
to
him
under
roof
he
sank
back
in
the
depth
of
despair
upon
his
seat
and
suffered
the
claret
to
pass
him
in
the
agony
of
his
feelings
mr
wentworth
and
mrs
morgan
were
avenged
this
was
how
it
came
to
be
noised
abroad
in
carlingford
that
some
great
change
of
a
highly
favourable
character
was
about
to
occur
in
the
circumstances
and
position
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
it
was
discussed
next
day
throughout
the
town
as
soon
as
people
had
taken
breath
after
telling
each
other
about
rosa
elsworthy
who
had
indisputably
been
carried
off
from
her
uncle
house
on
the
previous
night
when
the
wentworth
family
were
at
dinner
and
just
as
the
board
was
being
spread
in
the
rectory
where
mrs
morgan
was
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
having
company
it
had
been
discovered
in
elsworthy
that
the
prison
was
vacant
and
the
poor
little
bird
had
flown
mr
wentworth
was
aware
of
a
tumult
about
the
shop
when
he
went
to
the
miss
wodehouses
but
was
preoccupied
and
paid
no
attention
but
mr
leeson
who
was
not
preoccupied
had
already
heard
all
about
it
when
he
entered
the
rectory
that
day
it
was
all
over
the
town
as
may
be
supposed
the
poor
little
wicked
unfortunate
creature
had
disappeared
no
one
knew
how
at
the
moment
apparently
when
elsworthy
went
to
the
railway
for
the
evening
papers
a
time
when
the
were
generally
rampant
in
the
shop
mrs
elsworthy
for
her
part
had
seized
that
moment
to
relieve
her
soul
by
confiding
to
mrs
hayles
next
door
how
she
was
worrited
to
death
with
one
thing
and
another
and
did
not
expect
to
be
alive
to
tell
the
tale
if
things
went
on
like
this
for
another
month
but
that
elsworthy
was
infatuated
like
and
would
send
the
hussy
away
his
wife
complained
to
her
sympathetic
neighbour
when
elsworthy
came
back
however
he
was
struck
by
the
silence
in
the
house
and
sent
the
reluctant
woman
to
see
if
she
been
and
made
away
with
herself
i
suppose
the
indignant
wife
said
as
she
obeyed
leaving
mrs
hayles
full
of
curiosity
on
the
steps
of
the
door
mrs
elsworthy
however
uttered
a
shriek
a
moment
after
and
came
down
with
a
frightened
face
carrying
a
large
upon
which
skewered
through
and
through
with
the
biggest
pin
she
could
find
rosa
had
deposited
her
letter
of
this
important
document
was
read
over
in
the
shop
by
an
group
as
the
news
got
abroad
for
elsworthy
like
his
wife
lost
his
head
and
rushed
about
hither
and
thither
asking
wild
questions
as
to
who
had
seen
her
last
perhaps
at
the
bottom
he
was
not
so
desperate
as
he
looked
but
was
rather
grateful
than
angry
with
rosa
for
solving
the
difficulty
this
is
what
the
poor
little
runaway
said
dear
uncle
and
aunt
i
write
a
line
to
let
you
know
that
them
as
can
do
better
for
me
than
any
belonging
to
me
has
took
me
away
for
good
do
make
no
reflections
please
nor
blame
nobody
for
i
never
could
have
done
no
good
nor
had
any
at
carlingford
after
all
as
has
happened
i
do
bear
no
grudge
though
aunt
has
been
so
unkind
but
i
forgive
her
and
uncle
also
my
love
to
all
friends
and
you
may
tell
bob
hayles
as
i
wo
forget
him
but
will
order
all
my
physic
regular
at
his
father
your
affectionate
niece
rosa
uncle
has
no
occasion
to
mind
for
them
as
has
took
charge
of
me
has
promised
to
make
a
lady
of
me
as
he
always
said
i
was
worthy
of
and
i
leave
all
my
things
for
aunt
relations
as
i
ca
wear
such
poor
clothes
in
my
new
station
of
life
such
was
the
girl
letter
with
its
natural
impertinences
and
natural
touch
of
kindness
and
it
made
a
great
commotion
in
the
neighbourhood
where
a
few
spasmodic
were
made
up
with
no
real
intentions
and
came
to
nothing
as
was
to
be
expected
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
be
sure
to
happen
to
a
respectable
family
but
when
things
had
gone
so
far
the
neighbours
on
the
whole
were
inclined
to
believe
it
was
the
best
thing
rosa
could
have
done
and
the
elsworthys
husband
and
wife
were
concluded
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
when
carlingford
had
exhausted
this
subject
and
had
duly
discussed
the
probabilities
as
to
where
she
had
gone
and
whether
rosa
could
be
the
lady
in
a
veil
who
had
been
handed
into
the
express
by
two
gentlemen
of
whom
a
railway
porter
bore
cautious
testimony
the
other
mysterious
rumour
about
mr
wentworth
had
its
share
of
popular
attention
it
was
discussed
in
masters
with
a
solemnity
becoming
the
occasion
everybody
being
convinced
of
the
fact
and
nobody
knowing
how
it
was
to
be
one
prevailing
idea
was
that
mr
wentworth
brother
who
had
succeeded
to
his
mother
fortune
which
was
partly
true
like
most
popular
versions
of
family
history
his
mother
fortune
being
now
gerald
sole
dependence
intended
to
establish
a
great
brotherhood
upon
the
claydon
model
in
carlingford
of
which
the
perpetual
curate
was
to
be
the
head
this
idea
pleased
the
imagination
of
the
town
which
already
saw
itself
talked
of
in
all
the
papers
and
anticipated
with
excitement
the
sight
of
english
brothers
of
st
benedict
walking
about
in
the
streets
and
people
from
the
news
making
drawings
of
grange
lane
to
be
sure
gerald
wentworth
had
gone
over
to
the
church
of
rome
which
was
a
step
too
far
to
be
compatible
with
the
english
brotherhood
but
popular
imagination
when
puzzled
and
in
a
hurry
does
not
take
time
to
master
all
details
then
again
opinion
wavered
and
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
miss
wentworths
who
were
the
agents
of
the
coming
prosperity
they
had
made
up
their
mind
to
endow
st
roque
and
apply
to
the
ecclesiastical
commissioners
to
have
it
erected
into
a
parochial
district
rumour
reported
and
the
senior
assistant
in
masters
who
was
suspected
of
tendencies
was
known
to
be
a
supporter
of
this
theory
other
ideas
of
a
vague
character
floated
through
the
town
of
which
no
one
could
give
any
explanation
but
carlingford
was
unanimous
in
the
conviction
that
good
fortune
was
coming
somehow
to
the
popular
favourite
who
a
week
ago
had
occupied
temporarily
the
position
of
the
popular
and
impersonation
of
evil
but
the
real
sort
always
triumphs
at
the
last
was
the
verdict
of
wharfside
which
like
every
primitive
community
believed
in
poetic
justice
and
among
the
bargemen
and
their
wives
much
greater
elevation
than
that
of
a
district
church
or
the
headship
of
a
brotherhood
was
expected
for
the
clergyman
if
the
queen
had
sent
for
him
immediately
and
conferred
upon
him
a
bishopric
or
at
least
appointed
him
her
private
chaplain
such
a
favour
would
have
excited
no
surprise
in
wharfside
where
indeed
the
public
mind
was
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
the
real
use
of
queens
and
other
such
dignitaries
was
to
find
out
and
reward
merit
mr
wentworth
himself
laughed
when
the
gossip
reached
his
ears
my
people
have
given
away
all
they
had
to
give
he
said
to
somebody
who
had
asked
the
question
and
i
know
no
prospect
i
have
of
being
anything
but
a
perpetual
curate
unless
the
queen
sends
for
me
and
appoints
me
to
a
bishopric
as
i
understand
is
expected
in
prickett
lane
if
i
come
to
any
advancement
said
the
curate
of
st
roque
it
must
be
in
social
estimation
and
not
in
worldly
wealth
which
is
out
of
my
way
and
he
went
down
to
wharfside
rather
cheerfully
than
otherwise
having
begun
to
experience
that
pertinacity
carries
the
day
and
that
it
might
be
possible
to
goad
lucy
into
the
experiment
of
how
much
her
housekeeping
talents
were
good
for
and
whether
with
a
good
wife
even
a
perpetual
curate
might
be
able
to
live
without
any
particular
bother
in
respect
to
the
grocer
bill
mr
wentworth
being
at
present
warmly
engaged
in
this
business
of
persuasion
and
as
intent
as
ever
on
having
his
own
way
was
not
much
affected
by
the
carlingford
gossip
he
went
his
way
to
wharfside
all
the
same
where
the
service
was
conducted
as
of
old
and
where
all
the
humble
uncertain
voices
were
buoyed
up
and
carried
on
by
the
steady
pure
volume
of
liquid
sound
which
issued
from
lucy
wodehouse
lips
into
the
utterance
of
such
a
as
filled
mr
wentworth
mind
with
exultation
it
was
the
woman
part
in
the
worship
independent
yet
in
a
sweet
subordination
and
the
two
had
come
back
though
with
the
difference
that
their
love
was
now
avowed
and
certain
and
they
were
known
to
belong
to
each
other
to
much
the
same
state
of
feeling
in
which
they
were
before
the
miss
wentworths
came
to
carlingford
or
anything
uncomfortable
had
happened
they
had
learned
various
little
lessons
to
be
sure
in
the
interim
but
experience
had
not
done
much
more
for
them
than
it
does
for
ordinary
human
creatures
and
the
chances
are
that
mr
wentworth
would
have
conducted
himself
exactly
in
the
same
manner
another
time
had
he
been
placed
in
similar
circumstances
for
the
lessons
of
experience
however
valuable
are
sometimes
very
slow
of
impressing
themselves
upon
a
generous
and
hasty
temperament
which
has
high
ideas
of
honour
and
consistency
and
rather
piques
itself
on
a
contempt
for
and
external
advantages
which
was
the
weakness
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
he
returned
to
the
great
work
in
wharfside
with
undiminished
belief
in
it
and
a
sense
of
being
able
to
serve
his
god
and
his
which
though
it
may
seem
strange
to
some
people
was
a
wonderful
compensation
to
him
for
the
loss
of
skelmersdale
after
all
i
doubt
very
much
whether
under
any
circumstances
we
could
have
left
such
a
work
as
is
going
on
here
he
said
to
lucy
as
they
came
up
prickett
lane
together
where
the
poor
woman
had
just
died
peaceably
in
no
and
got
done
with
it
poor
soul
and
the
sister
of
mercy
in
her
grey
cloak
lifted
towards
him
the
blue
eyes
which
were
full
of
tears
and
answered
with
natural
emphasis
impossible
it
would
have
been
deserting
our
post
and
drew
a
step
closer
to
him
in
the
twilight
with
a
sense
of
the
sweetness
of
that
plural
pronoun
which
mingled
so
with
the
higher
sense
that
it
was
impossible
to
disjoin
them
and
the
two
went
on
under
the
influence
of
these
combined
sentiments
taking
comfort
out
of
the
very
hardness
of
the
world
around
them
in
which
their
ministrations
were
so
much
needed
and
feeling
an
exaltation
in
the
duty
which
was
not
for
one
but
for
both
and
a
belief
in
the
possibility
of
mending
matters
in
which
their
love
for
each
other
bore
a
large
share
for
it
was
not
in
human
nature
thus
to
begin
the
ideal
existence
without
believing
in
its
universal
extension
and
in
the
amelioration
of
life
and
the
world
that
is
all
they
think
of
said
poor
miss
wodehouse
who
between
her
wondering
inspection
of
the
two
young
people
and
her
own
moderate
and
sensible
and
the
directions
which
it
was
necessary
to
give
to
her
rector
about
the
furnishing
of
the
new
house
was
more
constantly
occupied
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
but
then
if
they
marry
what
are
they
to
live
upon
and
if
they
marry
perhaps
something
will
turn
up
my
dear
said
old
mrs
western
who
had
an
idea
that
providence
was
bound
to
provide
for
two
good
young
people
who
wanted
to
marry
and
thus
the
two
ladies
were
forced
to
leave
the
matter
where
indeed
the
historian
of
events
in
carlingford
would
willingly
leave
it
also
not
having
much
faith
in
the
rewards
of
virtue
which
come
convenient
in
such
an
emergency
but
it
is
only
pure
fiction
which
can
keep
true
to
nature
and
weave
its
narrative
in
analogy
with
the
ordinary
course
of
life
whereas
history
demands
exactness
in
matters
of
which
are
seldom
true
to
nature
or
amenable
to
any
general
rule
of
existence
before
proceeding
however
to
the
narrative
of
the
unexpected
advancement
and
promotion
which
awaited
the
perpetual
curate
it
may
be
as
well
to
notice
that
the
miss
wentworths
who
during
the
summer
had
kindly
given
their
house
at
skelmersdale
to
some
friends
who
had
returned
in
the
spring
from
india
found
themselves
now
in
a
position
to
return
to
their
own
proper
and
made
preparations
accordingly
for
leaving
carlingford
in
which
indeed
they
had
no
further
occupation
for
to
be
sure
except
to
the
extent
of
that
respect
which
a
man
owes
to
his
aunts
they
had
no
special
claim
upon
frank
wentworth
or
right
to
supervise
his
actions
save
on
account
of
skelmersdale
which
was
now
fully
disposed
of
and
given
away
it
can
not
be
said
that
miss
leonora
had
ever
fully
recovered
from
the
remarkable
indisposition
which
her
nephew
jack
final
address
had
brought
upon
her
the
very
next
morning
she
fulfilled
her
pledges
as
a
woman
of
honour
and
bestowed
skelmersdale
positively
and
finally
upon
julia
trench
curate
who
indeed
made
a
creditable
enough
rector
in
his
way
but
after
she
had
accomplished
this
act
miss
leonora
relapsed
into
one
unceasing
watch
upon
her
nephew
frank
which
was
far
from
dispelling
the
tendency
to
headache
which
she
showed
at
this
period
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
her
life
she
watched
him
with
a
certain
feeling
of
expiation
as
she
might
have
resorted
to
had
she
lived
a
few
hundred
years
before
and
perhaps
suffered
more
acute
pangs
in
that
act
of
discipline
than
could
be
inflicted
by
any
physical
scourge
the
longer
she
studied
the
matter
the
more
thoroughly
was
miss
leonora
convinced
not
only
that
the
perpetual
curate
was
bent
on
doing
his
duty
but
that
he
it
with
all
the
force
of
high
faculties
and
a
mind
much
more
thoroughly
trained
and
of
finer
material
than
was
possessed
by
the
man
whom
she
had
made
rector
of
skelmersdale
the
woman
bore
quietly
with
a
kind
of
defiance
the
sharp
wounds
with
which
her
was
pierced
by
this
sight
she
followed
up
her
discovery
and
made
herself
more
and
more
certain
of
the
mistake
she
had
made
not
sparing
herself
any
part
of
her
punishment
as
she
pursued
her
investigations
too
miss
leonora
became
increasingly
sensible
that
it
was
not
his
mother
family
whom
he
resembled
as
she
had
once
thought
but
that
he
was
out
and
out
a
wentworth
possessed
of
all
the
family
features
and
this
was
the
man
whom
by
her
own
act
she
had
disinherited
of
his
natural
share
in
the
patronage
of
the
family
substituting
for
her
own
flesh
and
blood
an
individual
for
whom
to
tell
the
truth
she
had
little
respect
perhaps
if
she
had
been
able
to
sustain
herself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
entirely
a
question
of
principle
the
retrospect
might
not
have
been
so
hard
upon
miss
leonora
but
being
a
woman
of
very
distinct
and
uncompromising
vision
she
could
not
conceal
from
herself
either
julia
trench
cleverness
or
her
own
mixed
and
doubtful
motives
having
this
sense
of
wrong
and
injustice
and
general
failure
of
the
duty
of
kindred
towards
frank
it
might
have
been
supposed
a
little
comfort
to
miss
leonora
to
perceive
that
he
had
entirely
recovered
from
his
disappointment
and
was
no
longer
in
her
power
if
indeed
he
had
ever
been
so
but
the
fact
was
that
if
anything
could
have
aggravated
her
personal
smart
it
would
have
been
the
fact
of
frank
indifference
and
cheerfulness
and
evident
capability
of
contenting
himself
with
his
duty
and
his
favourite
district
and
his
lucy
whom
to
be
sure
he
could
not
marry
being
only
a
perpetual
curate
the
spectacle
came
to
have
a
certain
fascination
for
miss
wentworth
she
kept
watching
him
with
a
grim
satisfaction
punishing
herself
and
at
the
same
time
comforting
herself
with
the
idea
that
light
as
he
made
of
it
he
must
be
suffering
too
she
could
not
bear
to
think
that
he
had
escaped
clean
out
of
her
hands
and
that
the
decision
she
had
come
to
which
produced
so
much
pain
to
herself
was
innoxious
to
frank
and
at
the
same
time
though
she
could
not
tolerate
his
composure
and
would
have
preferred
to
see
him
angry
and
revengeful
his
evident
recovery
of
spirits
and
general
exhilaration
increased
miss
leonora
respect
for
the
man
she
had
wronged
in
this
condition
of
mind
the
aunt
lingered
over
her
preparations
for
removal
scorning
much
the
rumour
in
carlingford
about
her
nephew
advancement
and
feeling
that
she
could
never
forgive
him
if
by
any
chance
promotion
should
come
to
him
after
all
he
will
stay
where
he
is
he
will
be
a
perpetual
curate
miss
leonora
said
uttering
what
was
in
reality
a
hope
under
the
shape
of
a
taunt
and
things
were
still
in
this
position
when
grange
lane
in
general
and
miss
dora
in
particular
from
the
window
of
the
were
startled
much
by
the
sight
of
the
rector
in
terribly
correct
clerical
costume
as
if
he
were
going
to
dine
with
the
bishop
who
walked
slowly
down
the
road
like
a
man
charged
with
a
mission
and
knocking
at
mrs
hadwin
door
was
admitted
immediately
to
a
private
conference
with
the
curate
of
st
roque
chapter
xlviii
it
was
the
same
afternoon
that
mr
wentworth
failed
to
attend
as
he
had
never
been
known
to
fail
before
at
the
afternoon
school
which
he
had
set
up
in
prickett
lane
for
the
young
bargemen
who
between
the
intervals
of
their
voyages
had
a
little
leisure
at
that
hour
of
the
day
it
is
true
there
was
a
master
provided
and
the
presence
of
the
perpetual
curate
was
not
indispensable
but
the
lads
among
whom
indeed
there
were
some
men
were
so
much
used
to
his
presence
as
to
get
restless
at
their
work
on
this
unprecedented
emergency
the
master
knew
no
other
resource
than
to
send
for
miss
lucy
wodehouse
who
was
known
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
prickett
lane
at
the
moment
superintending
a
similar
educational
undertaking
for
the
benefit
of
the
girls
it
was
as
may
be
supposed
embarrassing
to
lucy
to
be
called
upon
to
render
an
account
of
mr
wentworth
absence
and
invited
to
take
his
place
in
this
public
and
open
manner
but
then
the
conventional
reticences
were
unknown
in
wharfside
and
nobody
thought
it
necessary
to
conceal
his
certainty
that
the
curate
movements
were
better
known
to
lucy
than
to
anybody
else
she
had
to
make
answer
with
as
much
composure
as
possible
in
the
full
gaze
of
so
many
pairs
of
curious
eyes
that
she
did
not
know
why
mr
wentworth
was
absent
somebody
is
sick
perhaps
said
lucy
repeating
an
excuse
which
had
been
made
before
for
the
perpetual
curate
but
i
hope
it
does
not
make
any
difference
she
went
on
turning
round
upon
all
the
upturned
heads
which
were
neglecting
their
work
to
stare
at
her
mr
wentworth
would
be
grieved
to
think
that
his
absence
did
his
scholars
any
injury
lucy
looked
one
of
the
ringleaders
in
the
eyes
as
she
spoke
and
brought
him
to
his
senses
all
the
more
effectually
to
be
sure
because
she
knew
all
about
him
and
was
a
familiar
figure
to
the
boy
suggesting
various
little
comforts
for
which
in
lane
people
were
not
ungrateful
but
when
she
went
back
again
to
her
girls
the
young
lady
found
herself
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
was
half
annoyance
and
half
a
kind
of
shy
pleasure
to
be
sure
it
was
quite
true
that
they
did
belong
to
each
other
but
at
the
same
time
so
long
as
she
was
lucy
wodehouse
she
had
no
right
to
be
called
upon
to
represent
the
clergyman
even
in
the
district
which
was
so
important
to
both
and
then
it
occurred
to
her
to
remember
that
if
she
remained
lucy
wodehouse
that
was
not
the
curate
fault
from
which
thought
she
went
on
to
reflect
that
going
away
with
mr
and
mrs
proctor
when
they
were
married
was
not
a
charming
prospect
not
to
say
that
it
involved
a
renunciation
of
the
district
for
the
present
at
least
and
possibly
for
ever
for
if
mr
wentworth
could
not
marry
as
long
as
he
was
a
perpetual
curate
it
followed
of
necessity
that
he
could
not
marry
until
he
had
left
carlingford
an
idea
which
lucy
turned
over
in
her
mind
very
seriously
as
she
walked
home
for
this
once
unattended
a
new
light
seemed
to
be
thrown
upon
the
whole
matter
by
this
thought
to
consent
to
be
married
simply
for
her
own
happiness
to
the
disadvantage
in
any
respect
of
her
husband
was
an
idea
odious
to
this
young
woman
who
like
most
young
women
preferred
to
represent
even
to
herself
that
it
was
for
happiness
that
she
permitted
herself
to
be
persuaded
to
marry
but
if
duty
were
involved
that
was
quite
another
affair
it
was
quite
evident
to
lucy
as
she
walked
towards
grange
lane
that
the
curate
would
not
be
able
to
find
any
one
to
take
her
place
in
the
district
perhaps
also
for
she
was
honest
even
in
her
lucy
was
aware
that
she
might
herself
have
objections
to
the
finding
of
a
substitute
and
what
then
was
the
great
work
to
be
interrupted
because
she
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
possibly
diminishing
some
of
his
external
comforts
by
allowing
him
to
have
his
way
and
to
be
what
he
considered
happy
such
was
the
wonderful
length
to
which
her
thoughts
had
come
when
she
reached
the
from
which
mr
wentworth
himself
flushed
and
eager
came
hastily
out
as
she
approached
so
far
from
explaining
his
unaccountable
absence
or
even
greeting
her
with
ordinary
politeness
the
young
man
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
brought
her
into
the
garden
with
a
rapidity
which
made
her
giddy
what
is
it
what
do
you
mean
lucy
cried
with
amazement
as
she
found
herself
whirled
through
the
sunshine
and
half
carried
up
the
stairs
mr
wentworth
made
no
answer
until
he
had
deposited
her
breathless
in
her
own
chair
in
her
own
corner
and
then
got
down
on
his
knee
beside
her
as
men
in
his
crazy
circumstances
are
not
unapt
to
do
lucy
look
here
i
was
a
perpetual
curate
the
other
day
when
you
said
you
would
have
me
said
the
energetic
lover
who
was
certainly
out
of
his
wits
and
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
and
you
said
you
did
not
mind
i
said
it
did
not
matter
said
lucy
who
was
slightly
piqued
that
he
did
not
recollect
exactly
the
form
of
so
important
a
decision
i
knew
well
enough
you
were
a
perpetual
curate
has
anything
happened
or
are
you
going
out
of
your
mind
i
think
it
must
be
that
said
mr
wentworth
something
so
extraordinary
has
happened
that
i
can
not
believe
it
was
i
in
lane
this
afternoon
as
usual
or
was
i
at
home
in
my
own
room
talking
to
the
rector
or
have
i
fallen
asleep
somewhere
and
is
the
whole
thing
a
dream
you
were
certainly
not
in
prickett
lane
said
lucy
i
see
what
it
is
miss
leonora
wentworth
has
changed
her
mind
and
you
are
going
to
have
skelmersdale
after
all
i
did
not
think
you
could
have
made
up
your
mind
to
leave
the
district
it
is
not
news
that
gives
me
any
pleasure
said
the
sister
of
mercy
as
she
loosed
slowly
off
from
her
shoulders
the
grey
cloak
which
was
the
uniform
of
the
district
her
own
thoughts
had
been
so
different
that
she
felt
intensely
mortified
to
think
of
the
unnecessary
decision
she
had
been
so
near
making
and
disappointed
that
the
offer
of
a
living
could
have
moved
her
lover
to
such
a
pitch
of
pleasure
all
men
are
alike
it
seems
she
said
to
herself
with
a
little
quiver
in
her
lip
a
mode
of
forestalling
his
communications
which
filled
the
perpetual
curate
with
amazement
and
dismay
what
are
you
thinking
of
he
said
miss
leonora
wentworth
has
not
changed
her
mind
that
would
have
been
a
natural
accident
enough
but
this
is
incredible
if
you
like
lucy
he
added
with
an
unsteady
laugh
and
will
consent
to
my
original
proposition
you
may
marry
on
the
not
the
perpetual
curate
of
st
roque
but
the
rector
of
carlingford
do
look
at
me
with
such
an
unbelieving
countenance
it
is
quite
true
i
wonder
how
you
can
talk
so
cried
lucy
indignantly
it
is
all
a
story
you
know
it
is
i
do
like
practical
jokes
she
went
on
trembling
a
little
and
taking
another
furtive
look
at
him
for
somehow
it
was
too
wonderful
not
to
be
true
if
i
had
been
making
up
a
story
i
should
have
kept
to
what
was
likely
said
mr
wentworth
the
rector
has
been
with
me
all
the
afternoon
he
says
he
has
been
offered
his
father
rectory
where
he
was
brought
up
and
that
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
accept
it
as
he
always
was
fond
of
the
country
and
that
he
has
recommended
me
to
his
college
for
the
living
of
carlingford
yes
yes
said
lucy
impatiently
that
is
very
good
of
mr
morgan
but
you
know
you
are
not
a
member
of
the
college
and
why
should
you
have
the
living
i
knew
it
could
not
be
true
they
are
all
a
set
of
old
dons
said
the
perpetual
curate
that
is
they
are
the
most
accomplished
set
of
fellows
in
existence
lucy
or
at
least
they
ought
to
be
but
they
are
too
superior
to
take
an
ordinary
living
and
condescend
to
ordinary
existence
here
has
carlingford
been
twice
vacant
within
a
year
which
is
an
unprecedented
event
and
buller
the
only
man
who
would
think
of
it
is
hanging
on
for
a
colonial
bishopric
where
he
can
publish
his
book
at
his
leisure
buller
is
a
great
friend
of
gerald
it
is
incredible
but
it
is
true
is
it
true
are
you
it
is
true
cried
lucy
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
broke
down
and
gave
way
and
let
her
head
rest
on
the
first
convenient
support
it
found
which
turned
out
naturally
enough
to
be
mr
wentworth
shoulder
and
cried
as
if
her
heart
was
breaking
it
is
so
seldom
in
this
world
that
things
come
just
when
they
are
wanted
and
this
was
not
only
an
acceptable
benefice
but
implied
the
entire
possession
of
the
district
and
the
most
conclusive
vindication
of
the
curate
honour
lucy
cried
out
of
pride
and
happiness
and
glory
in
him
she
said
to
herself
as
mrs
morgan
had
done
at
the
beginning
of
her
incumbency
he
will
be
such
a
rector
as
carlingford
has
never
seen
yet
at
the
same
time
apart
from
her
glorying
and
her
pride
a
certain
sense
of
pain
exquisite
though
shortlived
found
expression
in
tears
she
had
just
been
making
up
her
mind
to
accept
a
share
of
his
lowliness
and
to
show
the
world
that
even
a
perpetual
curate
when
his
wife
was
equal
to
her
position
might
be
poor
without
feeling
any
of
the
degradations
of
poverty
and
now
she
was
forestalled
and
had
nothing
to
do
but
accept
his
competence
which
it
would
be
no
credit
to
manage
well
such
were
the
thoughts
to
which
she
was
reduced
though
she
had
come
home
from
prickett
lane
persuading
herself
that
it
was
duty
only
and
the
wants
of
the
district
which
moved
her
lucy
cried
although
not
much
given
to
crying
chiefly
because
it
was
the
only
method
she
could
find
of
giving
expression
to
the
feelings
which
were
too
varied
and
too
complicated
for
words
all
carlingford
knew
the
truth
about
mr
wentworth
advancement
that
evening
and
on
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
the
church
of
st
roque
was
as
full
as
if
the
plague
had
broken
out
in
carlingford
and
the
population
had
rushed
out
as
they
might
have
done
in
medieval
times
to
implore
the
succour
of
the
the
first
indication
of
the
unusual
throng
was
conveyed
to
mr
wentworth
in
his
little
vestry
after
the
choristers
had
filed
into
the
church
in
their
white
surplices
about
which
to
tell
the
truth
the
perpetual
curate
was
less
interested
than
he
had
once
been
elsworthy
who
had
been
humbly
assisting
the
young
priest
to
robe
himself
ventured
to
break
the
silence
when
they
were
alone
the
church
is
very
full
sir
said
elsworthy
there
a
deal
of
people
come
sir
after
hearing
the
news
i
do
say
i
always
been
as
good
a
servant
as
i
ought
to
have
been
but
it
was
all
through
being
led
away
and
not
knowing
no
better
and
putting
my
trust
where
i
should
have
put
it
i
had
a
hard
lesson
sir
and
i
learnt
better
he
continued
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
curate
face
it
was
all
a
mistake
i
was
not
finding
fault
with
you
that
i
am
aware
of
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
little
surprise
no
sir
said
elsworthy
i
am
aware
as
you
was
finding
no
fault
but
there
looks
as
speaks
as
strong
as
words
and
i
can
feel
as
you
have
the
confidence
in
me
as
you
once
had
i
aint
ashamed
to
say
it
sir
continued
the
clerk
of
st
roque
i
one
as
trusted
in
that
girl
innocent
looks
and
did
believe
as
she
could
do
no
harm
she
led
me
into
with
my
clergyman
sir
and
done
me
a
deal
o
damage
in
my
trade
and
now
she
gone
off
without
as
much
as
saying
you
for
your
kindness
it
a
hard
blow
upon
a
man
as
was
fond
of
her
and
i
did
make
no
difference
no
more
than
if
she
had
been
my
own
child
well
well
said
the
curate
i
daresay
it
was
a
trial
to
you
but
you
ca
expect
me
to
take
much
interest
in
it
after
all
that
has
passed
let
bygones
be
bygones
said
mr
wentworth
with
a
smile
as
indeed
you
once
proposed
ah
sir
that
was
my
mistake
sighed
the
penitent
i
would
have
myself
more
becoming
if
i
had
known
all
as
i
know
now
off
to
leave
st
roque
where
we
all
been
so
happy
said
mr
elsworthy
in
pathetic
tones
i
do
know
as
i
ever
was
as
sir
as
here
to
them
beautiful
sermons
and
my
best
attention
to
see
as
the
responses
was
well
spoke
out
and
things
done
proper
afore
our
troubles
began
sir
i
do
know
as
i
had
a
wish
in
the
world
unless
it
was
to
see
an
painted
window
in
the
chancel
which
is
all
as
is
wanted
to
make
the
church
perfect
and
now
you
to
leave
and
nobody
knows
what
kind
of
a
gentleman
may
be
sent
if
you
would
think
i
was
making
too
bold
said
elsworthy
it
aint
my
opinion
as
you
ever
put
up
with
poor
old
norris
as
is
in
the
church
men
like
mr
morgan
and
mr
proctor
as
had
no
cultivation
does
mind
but
for
a
gentleman
as
goes
through
the
service
as
you
does
it
mr
wentworth
mr
wentworth
laughed
though
he
was
fully
robed
and
ready
for
the
and
knew
that
his
congregation
was
waiting
he
held
his
watch
in
his
hand
though
it
already
marked
the
half
minute
after
eleven
so
you
would
like
to
be
clerk
in
the
parish
church
he
said
with
what
seemed
a
quite
unnecessary
amount
of
amusement
to
the
anxious
functionary
by
his
side
i
think
as
you
could
never
put
up
with
old
norris
sir
said
elsworthy
as
for
leading
of
the
responses
there
aint
such
a
thing
done
in
carlingford
church
i
do
speak
for
myself
said
the
clerk
but
it
aint
a
right
thing
for
the
rising
generation
and
it
aint
everybody
as
would
get
into
your
way
in
a
minute
for
you
have
a
way
of
your
own
sir
in
most
things
and
if
you
excuse
me
for
saying
of
it
you
very
particular
it
aint
every
man
sir
as
could
carry
on
clear
through
the
service
along
of
you
mr
wentworth
and
you
would
put
up
with
old
norris
not
for
a
day
such
was
the
conversation
which
opened
this
memorable
sunday
to
mr
wentworth
opposite
to
him
again
occupying
the
seat
where
his
wife
should
have
been
had
he
possessed
one
were
the
three
miss
wentworths
his
respected
aunts
to
whose
opinion
however
the
curate
did
not
feel
himself
bound
to
defer
very
greatly
in
present
circumstances
and
a
large
and
curious
congregation
ranged
behind
them
almost
as
much
concerned
to
see
how
mr
wentworth
would
conduct
himself
in
this
moment
of
triumph
as
they
had
been
in
the
moment
of
his
humiliation
it
is
however
needless
to
inform
the
friends
of
the
perpetual
curate
that
the
anxious
community
gained
very
little
by
their
curiosity
it
was
not
the
custom
of
the
young
anglican
to
carry
his
personal
feelings
either
of
one
kind
or
another
into
the
pulpit
with
him
much
less
into
the
where
he
was
the
interpreter
not
of
his
own
sentiments
or
emotions
but
of
common
prayer
and
universal
worship
mr
wentworth
did
not
even
throw
a
little
additional
warmth
into
his
utterance
of
the
general
thanksgiving
as
he
might
have
done
had
he
been
a
more
effusive
man
but
on
the
contrary
read
it
with
a
more
than
ordinary
calmness
and
preached
to
the
excited
people
one
of
those
terse
little
unimpassioned
sermons
of
his
from
which
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
divine
whether
he
was
in
the
depths
of
despair
or
at
the
summit
and
crown
of
happiness
people
who
had
been
used
to
discover
a
great
many
of
old
mr
bury
personal
peculiarities
in
his
sermons
and
who
of
recent
days
had
found
many
allusions
which
it
was
easy
to
interpret
in
the
discourses
of
mr
morgan
retired
altogether
baffled
from
the
clear
and
succinct
brevity
of
the
curate
of
st
roque
he
was
that
day
in
particular
so
terse
as
to
be
almost
epigrammatic
not
using
a
word
more
than
was
necessary
and
displaying
that
power
of
saying
a
great
deal
more
than
at
the
first
moment
he
appeared
to
say
in
which
mr
wentworth
admirers
specially
prided
themselves
perhaps
a
momentary
human
gratification
in
the
consciousness
of
having
utterly
baffled
curiosity
passed
through
the
curate
mind
as
he
took
off
his
robes
when
the
service
was
over
but
he
was
by
no
means
prepared
for
the
ordeal
which
awaited
him
when
he
stepped
forth
from
the
pretty
porch
of
st
roque
there
his
three
aunts
were
awaiting
him
eager
to
hear
all
about
it
miss
dora
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
holding
the
principal
place
we
are
going
away
frank
and
of
course
you
are
coming
to
lunch
with
us
said
aunt
dora
clinging
to
his
arm
oh
my
dear
boy
i
am
so
happy
and
so
ashamed
to
hear
of
it
to
think
you
should
be
provided
for
and
nobody
belonging
to
you
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
do
know
what
to
say
said
miss
dora
who
was
half
crying
as
usual
and
as
for
leonora
one
is
frightened
to
speak
to
her
oh
i
wish
you
would
say
something
to
your
aunt
leonora
frank
i
do
know
whether
she
is
angry
with
us
or
with
you
or
with
herself
or
what
it
is
or
if
it
is
an
attack
on
the
nerves
though
i
never
imagined
she
had
any
nerves
but
indeed
whatever
my
brother
may
say
it
looks
very
like
dreadfully
like
the
of
the
wentworth
complaint
poor
papa
was
just
like
that
when
he
used
to
have
it
coming
on
and
leonora
is
not
just
altogether
what
you
would
call
a
female
frank
oh
my
dear
boy
if
you
would
only
speak
to
her
cried
miss
dora
who
was
a
great
deal
too
much
in
earnest
to
perceive
anything
comical
in
what
she
had
said
i
should
think
it
must
be
an
attack
on
the
temper
said
the
curate
who
now
that
it
was
all
over
felt
that
it
was
but
just
his
aunt
leonora
should
suffer
a
little
for
her
treatment
of
him
perhaps
some
of
her
favourite
colporteurs
have
fallen
back
into
evil
ways
there
was
one
who
had
been
a
terrible
blackguard
i
remember
it
is
something
that
has
happened
among
her
mission
people
you
may
be
sure
and
nothing
about
me
you
do
know
leonora
frank
she
is
very
fond
of
you
though
she
does
not
show
it
said
miss
dora
as
she
led
her
victim
in
triumphantly
through
the
from
which
the
reluctant
young
man
could
see
lucy
and
her
sister
in
their
black
dresses
just
arriving
at
the
other
green
door
from
the
parish
church
where
they
had
occupied
their
usual
places
according
to
the
ideas
of
propriety
which
were
common
to
both
the
miss
wodehouses
mr
wentworth
had
to
content
himself
with
taking
off
his
hat
to
them
and
followed
his
aunts
to
the
table
where
miss
leonora
took
her
seat
much
with
the
air
of
a
judge
about
to
deliver
a
sentence
she
did
not
restrain
herself
even
in
the
consideration
of
the
presence
of
lewis
the
butler
who
to
be
sure
had
been
long
enough
in
the
wentworth
family
to
know
as
much
about
its
concerns
as
the
members
of
the
house
themselves
or
perhaps
a
little
more
miss
leonora
sat
down
grim
and
formidable
in
her
bonnet
which
was
in
the
style
of
a
remote
period
and
did
not
soften
the
severity
of
her
personal
appearance
she
pointed
her
nephew
to
a
seat
beside
her
but
she
did
not
relax
her
features
nor
condescend
to
any
ordinary
preliminaries
of
conversation
for
that
day
even
she
took
lewis
business
out
of
his
astonished
hands
and
herself
divided
the
chicken
with
a
swift
and
steady
knife
and
anatomical
precision
and
it
was
while
occupied
in
this
congenial
business
that
she
broke
forth
upon
frank
in
a
manner
so
unexpected
as
almost
to
take
away
his
breath
i
suppose
this
is
what
fools
call
poetic
justice
said
miss
leonora
which
is
just
of
a
piece
with
everything
else
that
is
poetical
weak
folly
and
nonsense
that
no
sensible
man
would
have
anything
to
say
to
how
a
young
man
like
you
who
know
how
to
conduct
yourself
in
some
things
and
have
i
do
deny
many
good
qualities
can
give
in
to
come
to
an
ending
like
a
trashy
novel
is
more
than
i
can
understand
you
are
fit
to
be
put
in
a
book
of
the
series
frank
as
an
illustration
of
the
reward
of
virtue
said
the
woman
with
a
little
snort
of
scorn
and
of
course
you
are
going
to
marry
and
live
happy
ever
after
like
a
fairy
tale
it
is
possible
i
may
be
guilty
of
that
additional
enormity
said
the
curate
which
at
all
events
will
not
be
your
doing
my
dear
aunt
if
i
might
suggest
a
consolation
you
can
not
help
such
things
happening
but
at
least
it
should
be
a
comfort
to
feel
you
have
done
nothing
to
bring
them
about
to
which
miss
leonora
answered
by
another
hard
breath
of
mingled
disdain
and
resentment
whatever
i
have
brought
about
i
have
tried
to
do
what
i
thought
my
duty
she
said
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
very
poor
sort
of
virtue
that
expects
a
reward
for
doing
what
it
ought
to
do
i
do
say
you
have
behaved
very
well
in
this
business
but
done
nothing
extraordinary
and
why
i
should
have
rushed
out
of
my
way
to
reward
you
for
it
oh
yes
i
know
you
did
not
expect
anything
said
miss
leonora
you
have
told
me
as
much
on
various
occasions
frank
you
have
of
course
always
been
perfectly
independent
and
scorned
to
flatter
your
old
aunts
by
any
deference
to
their
convictions
and
to
be
sure
it
is
nothing
to
you
any
little
pang
they
may
feel
at
having
to
dispose
otherwise
of
a
living
that
has
always
been
in
the
family
you
are
of
the
latest
fashion
of
anglicanism
and
we
are
only
a
parcel
of
old
women
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
our
antiquated
ideas
could
be
worth
as
much
to
you
as
a
parcel
of
flowers
and
trumpery
these
were
actually
tears
which
glittered
in
miss
leonora
eyes
of
fiery
hazel
grey
tears
of
very
diminutive
size
totally
unlike
the
big
dewdrops
which
rained
from
miss
dora
placid
orbs
and
made
them
red
but
did
no
harm
but
still
a
real
moisture
forced
out
of
a
fountain
which
lay
very
deep
down
and
inaccessible
to
ordinary
efforts
they
made
her
eyes
look
rather
fiercer
than
otherwise
for
the
moment
but
they
all
but
impeded
miss
leonora
speech
and
struck
with
the
wildest
consternation
the
entire
party
at
the
table
including
even
lewis
who
stood
transfixed
in
the
act
of
drawing
a
bottle
of
and
letting
the
cork
escape
him
in
his
amazement
brought
affairs
to
an
climax
by
hitting
miss
wentworth
who
had
been
looking
on
with
interest
without
taking
any
part
in
the
proceedings
when
the
fright
caused
by
this
unintentional
shot
had
subsided
miss
leonora
was
found
to
have
entirely
recovered
herself
but
not
so
the
perpetual
curate
who
had
changed
colour
wonderfully
and
no
longer
met
his
accuser
with
reciprocal
disdain
my
dear
aunt
said
frank
wentworth
i
wish
you
would
not
go
back
to
that
i
suppose
we
parsons
are
apt
sometimes
to
exaggerate
trifles
into
importance
as
my
father
says
but
however
as
things
have
turned
out
i
could
not
have
left
carlingford
the
curate
added
in
a
tone
of
conciliation
and
now
when
good
fortune
has
come
to
me
unsought
miss
leonora
finished
her
portion
of
chicken
in
one
energetic
gulp
and
got
up
from
the
table
poetic
justice
she
said
with
a
furious
sneer
i
do
believe
in
that
kind
of
rubbish
as
long
as
you
were
getting
on
quietly
with
your
work
i
felt
disposed
to
be
rather
proud
of
you
frank
but
i
do
approve
of
a
man
ending
off
neatly
like
a
novel
in
this
sort
of
ridiculous
way
when
you
succeed
to
the
rectory
i
suppose
you
will
begin
fighting
like
the
other
man
with
the
new
curate
for
working
in
your
parish
when
i
succeed
to
the
rectory
said
mr
wentworth
getting
up
in
his
turn
from
the
table
i
give
you
my
word
aunt
leonora
no
man
shall
work
in
parish
unless
i
set
him
to
do
it
now
i
must
be
off
to
my
work
i
do
suppose
carlingford
rectory
will
be
the
end
of
me
the
perpetual
curate
added
as
he
went
away
with
a
smile
which
his
aunts
could
not
interpret
as
for
miss
leonora
she
tied
her
very
tight
and
went
off
to
the
afternoon
service
at
salem
chapel
by
way
of
expressing
her
sentiments
more
forcibly
i
daresay
he
bold
enough
to
take
a
bishopric
she
said
to
herself
but
fortunately
we
got
in
our
own
hands
as
long
as
lord
shaftesbury
lives
and
miss
leonora
smiled
grimly
over
the
prerogatives
of
her
party
but
though
she
went
to
the
salem
chapel
that
afternoon
and
consoled
herself
that
she
could
secure
the
bench
of
bishops
from
any
audacious
invasion
of
frank
wentworth
hopes
it
is
true
notwithstanding
that
miss
leonora
sent
her
maid
next
morning
to
london
with
certain
obsolete
ornaments
of
which
though
the
fashion
was
hideous
the
jewels
were
precious
and
lucy
wodehouse
had
never
seen
anything
so
brilliant
as
the
appearance
they
presented
when
they
returned
shortly
after
reposing
upon
beds
of
white
satin
in
cases
of
velvet
ridiculous
things
as
miss
leonora
informed
her
for
a
parson
wife
it
was
some
time
after
this
for
not
to
speak
of
ecclesiastical
matters
a
removal
even
when
the
furniture
is
left
behind
and
there
are
only
books
and
rare
ferns
and
old
china
to
convey
from
one
house
to
another
is
a
matter
which
involves
delays
when
mr
wentworth
went
to
the
railway
station
with
mrs
morgan
to
see
her
off
finally
her
husband
having
gone
to
london
with
the
intention
of
joining
her
in
the
new
house
naturally
it
was
not
without
serious
thoughts
that
the
rector
wife
left
the
place
in
which
she
had
made
the
first
beginning
of
her
active
life
not
so
successfully
as
she
had
hoped
she
could
not
help
recalling
as
she
went
along
the
familiar
road
the
hopes
so
vivid
as
to
be
almost
certainties
with
which
she
had
come
into
carlingford
the
long
waiting
was
then
over
and
the
era
had
arrived
and
existence
had
seemed
to
be
opening
in
all
its
fulness
and
strength
before
the
two
who
had
looked
forward
to
it
so
long
it
was
not
much
more
than
six
months
ago
but
mrs
morgan
had
made
a
great
many
discoveries
in
the
mean
time
she
had
found
out
the
wonderful
difference
between
anticipation
and
reality
and
that
life
even
to
a
happy
woman
married
after
long
patience
to
the
man
of
her
choice
was
not
the
smooth
road
it
looked
but
a
rough
path
enough
cut
into
dangerous
ruts
through
which
generations
of
men
and
women
followed
each
other
without
ever
being
able
to
mend
the
way
she
was
not
so
sure
as
she
used
to
be
of
a
great
many
important
matters
which
it
is
a
wonderful
consolation
to
be
certain
of
but
notwithstanding
had
to
go
on
as
if
she
had
no
doubts
though
the
clouds
of
a
defeat
in
which
certainly
no
honour
though
a
good
deal
of
the
of
inexperience
had
been
lost
were
still
looming
behind
she
gave
a
little
sigh
as
she
shook
mr
wentworth
hand
at
parting
a
great
many
things
have
happened
in
six
months
she
said
one
never
could
have
anticipated
so
many
changes
in
what
looks
so
short
a
period
of
life
and
as
the
train
which
she
had
watched
so
often
rushed
past
that
new
bit
of
wall
on
which
the
virginian
creeper
was
beginning
to
grow
luxuriantly
which
screened
the
railway
from
the
rectory
windows
there
were
tears
in
mrs
morgan
eyes
only
six
months
and
so
much
had
happened
what
might
not
happen
in
all
those
months
in
all
those
years
of
life
which
scarcely
looked
so
hopeful
as
of
old
she
preferred
turning
her
back
upon
carlingford
though
it
was
the
least
comfortable
side
of
the
carriage
and
put
down
her
veil
to
shield
her
eyes
from
the
dust
or
perhaps
from
the
inspection
of
her
and
once
more
the
familiar
thought
returned
to
her
of
what
a
different
woman
she
would
have
been
had
she
come
to
her
first
experiences
of
life
with
the
courage
and
confidence
of
twenty
or
even
of
which
was
the
age
mrs
morgan
dwelt
upon
most
kindly
and
then
she
thought
with
a
thrill
of
vivid
kindness
and
a
touch
of
tender
envy
of
lucy
wodehouse
who
would
now
have
no
possible
occasion
to
wait
those
ten
years
as
for
mr
wentworth
he
who
was
a
priest
and
knew
more
about
carlingford
than
any
other
man
in
the
place
could
not
help
thinking
as
he
turned
back
of
people
there
to
whom
these
six
months
had
produced
alterations
far
more
terrible
than
any
that
had
befallen
the
rector
wife
people
from
whom
the
light
of
life
had
died
out
and
to
whom
all
the
world
was
changed
he
knew
of
men
who
had
been
cheerful
enough
when
mr
morgan
came
to
carlingford
who
now
did
not
care
what
became
of
them
and
of
women
who
would
be
glad
to
lay
down
their
heads
and
hide
them
from
the
mocking
light
of
day
he
knew
it
and
it
touched
his
heart
with
the
tenderest
pity
of
life
the
compassion
of
happiness
and
he
knew
too
that
the
path
upon
which
he
was
about
to
set
out
led
through
the
same
glooms
and
was
no
ideal
career
but
perhaps
because
mr
wentworth
was
young
perhaps
because
he
was
possessed
by
that
delicate
sprite
more
dainty
than
any
ariel
who
puts
rosy
girdles
round
the
world
while
his
time
of
triumph
lasts
it
is
certain
that
the
new
rector
of
carlingford
turned
back
into
grange
lane
without
the
least
shadow
upon
his
mind
or
timidity
in
his
thoughts
he
was
now
in
his
own
domains
an
independent
monarch
as
little
inclined
to
divide
his
power
as
any
autocrat
and
mr
wentworth
came
into
his
kingdom
without
any
doubts
of
his
success
in
it
or
of
his
capability
for
its
government
he
had
first
a
little
journey
to
make
to
bring
back
lucy
from
that
temporary
and
reluctant
separation
from
the
district
which
propriety
had
made
needful
but
in
the
mean
time
mr
wentworth
trode
with
firm
foot
the
streets
of
his
parish
secure
that
no
parson
nor
priest
should
tithe
or
toll
in
his
dominions
and
a
great
deal
more
sure
than
even
mr
morgan
had
been
that
henceforth
no
unauthorised
evangelisation
should
take
place
in
any
portion
of
his
territory
this
sentiment
perhaps
was
the
principal
difference
perceptible
by
the
community
in
general
between
the
new
rector
of
carlingford
and
the
late
perpetual
curate
