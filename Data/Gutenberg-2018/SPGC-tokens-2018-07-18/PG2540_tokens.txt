preface
at
the
present
hour
when
fiction
takes
forms
so
ingenious
and
so
specious
it
is
perhaps
necessary
to
say
that
the
following
narrative
in
all
its
parts
and
so
far
as
the
punctilious
attention
of
the
writer
has
been
able
to
keep
it
so
is
scrupulously
true
if
it
were
not
true
in
this
strict
sense
to
publish
it
would
be
to
trifle
with
all
those
who
may
be
induced
to
read
it
it
is
offered
to
them
as
a
as
a
record
of
educational
and
religious
conditions
which
having
passed
away
will
never
return
in
this
respect
as
the
diagnosis
of
a
dying
puritanism
it
is
hoped
that
the
narrative
will
not
be
altogether
without
significance
it
offers
too
in
a
subsidiary
sense
a
study
of
the
development
of
moral
and
intellectual
ideas
during
the
progress
of
infancy
these
have
been
closely
and
conscientiously
noted
and
may
have
some
value
in
consequence
of
the
unusual
conditions
in
which
they
were
produced
the
author
has
observed
that
those
who
have
written
about
the
facts
of
their
own
childhood
have
usually
delayed
to
note
them
down
until
age
has
dimmed
their
recollections
perhaps
an
even
more
common
fault
in
such
autobiographies
is
that
they
are
sentimental
and
are
falsified
by
and
the
writer
of
these
recollections
has
thought
that
if
the
examination
of
his
earliest
years
was
to
be
undertaken
at
all
it
should
be
attempted
while
his
memory
is
still
perfectly
vivid
and
while
he
is
still
unbiased
by
the
forgetfulness
or
the
sensibility
of
advancing
years
at
one
point
only
has
there
been
any
tampering
with
precise
fact
it
is
believed
that
with
the
exception
of
the
son
there
is
but
one
person
mentioned
in
this
book
who
is
still
alive
nevertheless
it
has
been
thought
well
in
order
to
avoid
any
appearance
of
offence
to
alter
the
majority
of
the
proper
names
of
the
private
persons
spoken
of
it
is
not
usual
perhaps
that
the
narrative
of
a
spiritual
struggle
should
mingle
merriment
and
humour
with
a
discussion
of
the
most
solemn
subjects
it
has
however
been
inevitable
that
they
should
be
so
mingled
in
this
narrative
it
is
true
that
most
funny
books
try
to
be
funny
throughout
while
theology
is
scandalized
if
it
awakens
a
single
smile
but
life
is
not
constituted
thus
and
this
book
is
nothing
if
it
is
not
a
genuine
slice
of
life
there
was
an
extraordinary
mixture
of
comedy
and
tragedy
in
the
situation
which
is
here
described
and
those
who
are
affected
by
the
pathos
of
it
will
not
need
to
have
it
explained
to
them
that
the
comedy
was
superficial
and
the
tragedy
essential
september
chapter
i
this
book
is
the
record
of
a
struggle
between
two
temperaments
two
consciences
and
almost
two
epochs
it
ended
as
was
inevitable
in
disruption
of
the
two
human
beings
here
described
one
was
born
to
fly
backward
the
other
could
not
help
being
carried
forward
there
came
a
time
when
neither
spoke
the
same
language
as
the
other
or
encompassed
the
same
hopes
or
was
fortified
by
the
same
desires
but
at
least
it
is
some
consolation
to
the
survivor
that
neither
to
the
very
last
hour
ceased
to
respect
the
other
or
to
regard
him
with
a
sad
indulgence
the
affection
of
these
two
persons
was
assailed
by
forces
in
comparison
with
which
the
changes
that
health
or
fortune
or
place
introduce
are
as
nothing
it
is
a
mournful
satisfaction
but
yet
a
satisfaction
that
they
were
both
of
them
able
to
obey
the
law
which
says
that
ties
of
close
family
relationship
must
be
honoured
and
sustained
had
it
not
been
so
this
story
would
never
have
been
told
the
struggle
began
soon
yet
of
course
it
did
not
begin
in
early
infancy
but
to
familiarize
my
readers
with
the
conditions
of
the
two
persons
which
were
unusual
and
with
the
outlines
of
their
temperaments
which
were
perhaps
innately
antagonistic
it
is
needful
to
open
with
some
account
of
all
that
i
can
truly
and
independently
recollect
as
well
as
with
some
statements
which
are
as
will
be
obvious
due
to
household
tradition
my
parents
were
poor
gentlefolks
not
young
solitary
sensitive
and
although
they
did
not
know
it
proud
they
both
belonged
to
what
is
called
the
middle
class
and
there
was
this
further
resemblance
between
them
that
they
each
descended
from
families
which
had
been
more
than
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
had
gradually
sunken
in
fortune
in
both
houses
there
had
been
a
decay
of
energy
which
had
led
to
decay
in
wealth
in
the
case
of
my
father
family
it
had
been
a
slow
decline
in
that
of
my
mother
it
had
been
rapid
my
maternal
grandfather
was
born
wealthy
and
in
the
opening
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
immediately
after
his
marriage
he
bought
a
little
estate
in
north
wales
on
the
slopes
of
snowdon
here
he
seems
to
have
lived
in
a
pretentious
way
keeping
a
pack
of
hounds
and
entertaining
on
an
extravagant
scale
he
had
a
wife
who
encouraged
him
in
this
vivid
life
and
three
children
my
mother
and
her
two
brothers
his
best
trait
was
his
devotion
to
the
education
of
his
children
in
which
he
proclaimed
himself
a
disciple
of
rousseau
but
he
can
hardly
have
followed
the
teaching
of
very
closely
since
he
employed
tutors
to
teach
his
daughter
at
an
extremely
early
age
the
very
subjects
which
rousseau
forbade
such
as
history
literature
and
foreign
languages
my
mother
was
his
special
favourite
and
his
vanity
did
its
best
to
make
a
bluestocking
of
her
she
read
greek
latin
and
even
a
little
hebrew
and
what
was
more
important
her
mind
was
trained
to
be
but
she
was
diametrically
opposed
in
essential
matters
to
her
luxurious
and
parents
reviewing
her
life
in
her
thirtieth
year
she
remarked
in
some
secret
notes
can
not
recollect
the
time
when
i
did
not
love
religion
she
used
a
still
more
remarkable
expression
i
must
date
my
conversion
from
my
first
wish
and
trial
to
be
holy
i
may
go
back
to
infancy
if
i
am
to
postpone
it
till
after
my
last
wilful
sin
it
is
scarcely
yet
begun
the
irregular
pleasures
of
her
parents
life
were
deeply
distasteful
to
her
as
such
were
to
many
young
persons
in
those
days
of
the
wide
revival
of
conscience
and
when
my
grandfather
by
his
reckless
expenditure
which
he
never
checked
till
ruin
was
upon
him
was
obliged
to
sell
his
estate
and
live
in
penury
my
mother
was
the
only
member
of
the
family
who
did
not
regret
the
change
for
my
own
part
i
believe
i
should
have
liked
my
reprobate
maternal
grandfather
but
his
conduct
was
certainly
very
vexatious
he
died
in
his
eightieth
year
when
i
was
nine
months
old
it
was
a
curious
coincidence
that
life
had
brought
both
my
parents
along
similar
paths
to
an
almost
identical
position
in
respect
to
religious
belief
she
had
started
from
the
anglican
standpoint
he
from
the
wesleyan
and
each
almost
without
counsel
from
others
and
after
varied
theological
experiments
had
come
to
take
up
precisely
the
same
attitude
towards
all
divisions
of
the
protestant
church
that
namely
of
detached
and
unbiased
contemplation
so
far
as
the
sects
agreed
with
my
father
and
my
mother
the
sects
were
walking
in
the
light
wherever
they
differed
from
them
they
had
slipped
more
or
less
definitely
into
a
penumbra
of
their
own
making
a
darkness
into
which
neither
of
my
parents
would
follow
them
hence
by
a
process
of
selection
my
father
and
my
mother
alike
had
gradually
without
violence
found
themselves
shut
outside
all
protestant
communions
and
at
last
they
met
only
with
a
few
extreme
calvinists
like
themselves
on
terms
of
what
may
almost
be
called
negation
with
no
priest
no
ritual
no
festivals
no
ornament
of
any
kind
nothing
but
the
lord
supper
and
the
exposition
of
holy
scripture
drawing
these
austere
spirits
into
any
sort
of
cohesion
they
called
themselves
brethren
simply
a
title
enlarged
by
the
world
outside
into
brethren
it
was
accident
and
similarity
which
brought
my
parents
together
at
these
meetings
of
the
brethren
each
was
lonely
each
was
poor
each
was
accustomed
to
a
strenuous
intellectual
support
he
was
nearly
she
was
past
when
they
married
from
a
suburban
lodging
he
brought
her
home
to
his
mother
little
house
in
the
northeast
of
london
without
a
single
day
honeymoon
my
father
was
a
zoologist
and
a
writer
of
books
on
natural
history
my
mother
also
was
a
writer
author
already
of
two
slender
volumes
of
religious
verse
the
earlier
of
which
i
know
not
how
must
have
enjoyed
some
slight
success
since
a
second
edition
was
printed
afterwards
she
devoted
her
pen
to
popular
works
of
edification
but
how
infinitely
removed
in
their
aims
their
habits
their
ambitions
from
people
of
the
present
day
words
are
scarcely
adequate
to
describe
neither
knew
nor
cared
about
any
manifestation
of
current
literature
for
each
there
had
been
no
poet
later
than
byron
and
neither
had
read
a
romance
since
in
childhood
they
had
dipped
into
the
waverley
novels
as
they
appeared
in
succession
for
each
the
various
forms
of
imaginative
and
scientific
literature
were
merely
means
of
improvement
and
profit
which
kept
the
student
of
the
world
gave
him
full
employment
and
enabled
him
to
maintain
himself
but
pleasure
was
found
nowhere
but
in
the
word
of
god
and
to
the
endless
discussion
of
the
scriptures
each
hurried
when
the
day
work
was
over
in
this
strange
household
the
advent
of
a
child
was
not
welcomed
but
was
borne
with
resignation
the
event
was
thus
recorded
in
my
father
diary
delivered
of
a
son
received
green
swallow
from
jamaica
this
entry
has
caused
amusement
as
showing
that
he
was
as
much
interested
in
the
bird
as
in
the
boy
but
this
does
not
follow
what
the
wording
exemplifies
is
my
father
extreme
punctilio
the
green
swallow
arrived
later
in
the
day
than
the
son
and
the
earlier
visitor
was
therefore
recorded
first
my
father
was
scrupulous
in
every
species
of
arrangement
long
afterwards
my
father
told
me
that
my
mother
suffered
much
in
giving
birth
to
me
and
that
uttering
no
cry
i
appeared
to
be
dead
i
was
laid
with
scant
care
on
another
bed
in
the
room
while
all
anxiety
and
attention
were
concentrated
on
my
mother
an
old
woman
who
happened
to
be
there
and
who
was
unemployed
turned
her
thoughts
to
me
and
tried
to
awake
in
me
a
spark
of
vitality
she
succeeded
and
she
was
afterwards
complimented
by
the
doctor
on
her
cleverness
my
father
could
not
when
he
told
me
the
story
recollect
the
name
of
my
preserver
i
have
often
longed
to
know
who
she
was
for
all
the
rapture
of
life
for
all
its
turmoils
its
anxious
desires
its
manifold
pleasures
and
even
for
its
sorrow
and
suffering
i
bless
and
praise
that
anonymous
old
lady
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
it
was
six
weeks
before
my
mother
was
able
to
leave
her
room
the
occasion
was
made
a
solemn
one
and
was
attended
by
a
species
of
churching
balfour
a
valued
minister
of
the
denomination
held
a
private
service
in
the
parlour
and
for
our
child
that
he
may
be
the
lord
this
was
the
opening
act
of
that
which
was
never
henceforward
forgotten
and
of
which
the
following
pages
will
endeavour
to
describe
the
results
around
my
tender
and
unconscious
spirit
was
flung
the
luminous
web
the
light
and
elastic
but
impermeable
veil
which
it
was
hoped
would
keep
me
from
the
world
until
this
time
my
father
mother
had
lived
in
the
house
and
taken
the
domestic
charges
of
it
on
her
own
shoulders
she
now
consented
to
leave
us
to
ourselves
there
is
no
question
that
her
exodus
was
a
relief
to
my
mother
since
my
paternal
grandmother
was
a
strong
and
masterful
woman
buxom
choleric
and
practical
for
whom
the
interests
of
the
mind
did
not
exist
her
gentle
as
she
was
and
ethereal
in
manner
and
appearance
strangely
contrasted
no
doubt
in
her
tinctures
of
gold
hair
and
white
skin
with
my
grandmother
bold
carnations
and
black
tresses
was
yet
possessed
of
a
will
like
tempered
steel
they
were
better
friends
apart
with
my
grandmother
lodged
hard
by
in
a
bright
room
her
household
gods
and
bits
of
excellent
furniture
around
her
her
miniatures
and
sparkling
china
arranged
on
shelves
left
to
my
mother
sole
care
i
became
the
centre
of
her
solicitude
but
there
mingled
with
those
happy
animal
instincts
which
sustain
the
strength
and
patience
of
every
human
mother
and
were
fully
present
with
her
there
mingled
with
these
certain
spiritual
determinations
which
can
be
but
rare
they
are
in
their
outline
i
suppose
vaguely
common
to
many
religious
mothers
but
there
are
few
indeed
who
fill
up
the
sketch
with
so
firm
a
detail
as
she
did
once
again
i
am
indebted
to
her
secret
notes
in
a
little
locked
volume
seen
until
now
nearly
sixty
years
later
by
no
eye
save
her
own
thus
she
wrote
when
i
was
two
months
old
have
given
him
to
the
lord
and
we
trust
that
he
will
really
manifest
him
to
be
his
own
if
he
grow
up
and
if
the
lord
take
him
early
we
will
not
doubt
that
he
is
taken
to
himself
only
if
it
please
the
lord
to
take
him
i
do
trust
we
may
be
spared
seeing
him
suffering
in
lingering
illness
and
much
pain
but
in
this
as
in
all
things
his
will
is
better
than
what
we
can
choose
whether
his
life
be
prolonged
or
not
it
has
already
been
a
blessing
to
us
and
to
the
saints
in
leading
us
to
much
prayer
and
bringing
us
into
varied
need
and
some
trial
the
last
sentence
is
somewhat
obscure
to
me
how
at
that
tender
age
i
contrived
to
be
a
blessing
the
saints
may
surprise
others
and
puzzles
myself
but
saints
was
the
habitual
term
by
which
were
indicated
the
friends
who
met
on
sunday
mornings
for
holy
communion
and
at
many
other
times
in
the
week
for
prayer
and
discussion
of
the
scriptures
in
the
small
hired
hall
at
hackney
which
my
parents
attended
i
suppose
that
the
solemn
dedication
of
me
to
the
lord
which
was
repeated
in
public
in
my
mother
arms
being
by
no
means
a
usual
or
familiar
ceremony
even
among
the
brethren
created
a
certain
curiosity
and
fervour
in
the
immediate
services
or
was
imagined
so
to
do
by
the
fond
partial
heart
of
my
mother
she
however
who
had
been
so
much
isolated
now
made
the
care
of
her
child
an
excuse
for
retiring
still
further
into
silence
with
those
religious
persons
who
met
at
the
room
as
the
modest
chapel
was
called
she
had
little
spiritual
and
no
intellectual
sympathy
she
noted
do
not
think
it
would
increase
my
happiness
to
be
in
the
midst
of
the
saints
at
hackney
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
give
myself
up
to
baby
for
the
winter
and
to
accept
no
invitations
to
go
when
i
can
to
the
sunday
morning
meetings
and
to
see
my
own
mother
the
monotony
of
her
existence
now
became
extreme
but
she
seems
to
have
been
happy
her
days
were
spent
in
taking
care
of
me
and
in
directing
one
young
servant
my
father
was
forever
in
his
study
writing
drawing
dissecting
sitting
no
doubt
as
i
grew
afterwards
accustomed
to
see
him
absolutely
motionless
with
his
eye
glued
to
the
microscope
for
twenty
minutes
at
a
time
so
the
greater
part
of
every
weekday
was
spent
and
on
sunday
he
usually
preached
one
and
sometimes
two
extempore
sermons
his
workday
labours
were
rewarded
by
the
praise
of
the
learned
world
to
which
he
was
indifferent
but
by
very
little
money
which
he
needed
more
for
over
three
years
after
their
marriage
neither
of
my
parents
left
london
for
a
single
day
not
being
able
to
afford
to
travel
they
received
scarcely
any
visitors
never
ate
a
meal
away
from
home
never
spent
an
evening
in
social
intercourse
abroad
at
night
they
discussed
theology
read
aloud
to
one
another
or
translated
scientific
brochures
from
french
or
german
it
sounds
a
terrible
life
of
pressure
and
deprivation
and
that
it
was
physically
unwholesome
there
can
be
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
but
their
contentment
was
complete
and
unfeigned
in
the
midst
of
this
materially
the
hardest
moment
of
their
lives
when
i
was
one
year
old
and
there
was
a
question
of
our
leaving
london
my
mother
recorded
in
her
secret
notes
are
happy
and
contented
having
all
things
needful
and
pleasant
and
our
present
habitation
is
hallowed
by
many
sweet
associations
we
have
our
house
to
ourselves
and
enjoy
each
other
society
if
we
move
we
shall
no
longer
be
alone
the
situation
may
be
more
favourable
however
for
baby
as
being
more
in
the
country
i
desire
to
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
but
as
i
know
not
what
would
be
for
our
good
and
god
knows
so
i
desire
to
leave
it
with
him
and
if
it
is
not
his
will
we
should
move
he
will
raise
objections
and
difficulties
and
if
it
is
his
will
he
will
make
henry
my
father
desirous
and
anxious
to
take
the
step
and
then
whatever
the
result
let
us
leave
all
to
him
and
not
regret
it
no
one
who
is
acquainted
with
the
human
heart
will
mistake
this
attitude
of
resignation
for
weakness
of
purpose
it
was
not
poverty
of
will
it
was
abnegation
it
was
a
voluntary
act
my
mother
underneath
an
exquisite
amenity
of
manner
concealed
a
rigour
of
spirit
which
took
the
form
of
a
constant
for
it
to
dawn
upon
her
consciousness
that
she
wished
for
something
was
definitely
to
renounce
that
wish
or
more
exactly
to
subject
it
in
every
thing
to
what
she
conceived
to
be
the
will
of
god
this
is
perhaps
the
right
moment
for
me
to
say
that
at
this
time
and
indeed
until
the
hour
of
her
death
she
exercised
without
suspecting
it
a
magnetic
power
over
the
will
and
nature
of
my
father
both
were
strong
but
my
mother
was
unquestionably
the
stronger
of
the
two
it
was
her
mind
which
gradually
drew
his
to
take
up
a
certain
definite
position
and
this
remained
permanent
although
she
the
cause
of
it
was
early
removed
hence
while
it
was
with
my
father
that
the
long
struggle
which
i
have
to
narrate
took
place
behind
my
father
stood
the
ethereal
memory
of
my
mother
will
guiding
him
pressing
him
holding
him
to
the
unswerving
purpose
which
she
had
formed
and
defined
and
when
the
inevitable
disruption
came
what
was
unspeakably
painful
was
to
realize
that
it
was
not
from
one
but
from
both
parents
that
the
purpose
of
the
child
was
separated
my
mother
was
a
puritan
in
grain
and
never
a
word
escaped
her
not
a
phrase
exists
in
her
diary
to
suggest
that
she
had
any
privations
to
put
up
with
she
seemed
strong
and
well
and
so
did
i
the
one
of
us
who
broke
down
was
my
father
with
his
attack
of
acute
nervous
dyspepsia
came
an
unexpected
small
accession
of
money
and
we
were
able
in
my
third
year
to
take
a
holiday
of
nearly
ten
months
in
devonshire
the
extreme
seclusion
the
unbroken
strain
were
never
repeated
and
when
we
returned
to
london
it
was
to
conditions
of
greater
amenity
and
to
a
less
rigid
practice
of
world
forgetting
by
the
world
forgot
that
this
relaxation
was
more
relative
than
positive
and
that
nothing
ever
really
tempted
either
of
my
parents
from
their
cavern
in
an
intellectual
thebaid
my
recollections
will
amply
prove
but
each
of
them
was
forced
by
circumstances
into
a
more
or
less
public
position
and
neither
could
any
longer
quite
ignore
the
world
around
it
is
not
my
business
here
to
the
biographies
of
my
parents
each
of
them
became
in
a
certain
measure
celebrated
and
each
was
the
subject
of
a
good
deal
of
contemporary
discussion
each
was
prominent
before
the
eyes
of
a
public
of
his
or
her
own
half
a
century
ago
it
is
because
their
minds
were
vigorous
and
their
accomplishments
distinguished
that
the
contrast
between
their
spiritual
point
of
view
and
the
aspect
of
a
similar
class
of
persons
today
is
interesting
and
may
i
hope
be
instructive
but
this
is
not
another
memoir
of
public
individuals
each
of
whom
has
had
more
than
one
biographer
my
serious
duty
as
i
venture
to
hold
it
is
other
that
the
world
side
thus
men
saw
them
praised
them
thought
they
knew
them
there
in
turn
i
stood
aside
and
praised
them
out
of
my
own
self
i
dare
to
phrase
it
but
this
is
a
different
inspection
this
is
a
study
of
the
other
side
the
novel
silent
silver
lights
and
darks
undreamed
of
the
record
of
a
state
of
soul
once
not
uncommon
in
protestant
europe
of
which
my
parents
were
perhaps
the
latest
consistent
exemplars
among
people
of
light
and
leading
the
peculiarities
of
a
family
life
founded
upon
such
principles
are
in
relation
to
a
little
child
obvious
but
i
may
be
permitted
to
recapitulate
them
here
was
perfect
purity
perfect
intrepidity
perfect
abnegation
yet
there
was
also
narrowness
isolation
an
absence
of
perspective
let
it
be
boldly
admitted
an
absence
of
humanity
and
there
was
a
curious
mixture
of
humbleness
and
arrogance
entire
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
and
not
less
entire
disdain
of
the
judgement
and
opinion
of
man
my
parents
founded
every
action
every
attitude
upon
their
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
and
upon
the
guidance
of
the
divine
will
as
revealed
to
them
by
direct
answer
to
prayer
their
ejaculation
in
the
face
of
any
dilemma
was
us
cast
it
before
the
lord
so
confident
were
they
of
the
reality
of
their
intercourse
with
god
that
they
asked
for
no
other
guide
they
recognized
no
spiritual
authority
among
men
they
subjected
themselves
to
no
priest
or
minister
they
troubled
their
consciences
about
no
current
manifestation
of
opinion
they
lived
in
an
intellectual
cell
bounded
at
its
sides
by
the
walls
of
their
own
house
but
open
above
to
the
very
heart
of
the
uttermost
heavens
this
then
was
the
scene
in
which
the
soul
of
a
little
child
was
planted
not
as
in
an
ordinary
open
or
carefully
tended
social
but
as
on
a
ledge
split
in
the
granite
of
some
mountain
the
ledge
was
hung
between
night
and
the
snows
on
one
hand
and
the
dizzy
depths
of
the
world
upon
the
other
was
furnished
with
just
soil
enough
for
a
gentian
to
struggle
skywards
and
open
its
stiff
azure
stars
and
offered
no
lodgement
no
hope
of
salvation
to
any
rootlet
which
should
stray
beyond
its
inexorable
limits
chapter
ii
out
of
the
darkness
of
my
infancy
there
comes
only
one
flash
of
memory
i
am
seated
alone
in
my
at
a
set
for
several
people
somebody
brings
in
a
leg
of
mutton
puts
it
down
close
to
me
and
goes
out
i
am
again
alone
gazing
at
two
low
windows
wide
open
upon
a
garden
suddenly
noiselessly
a
large
long
animal
obviously
a
greyhound
appears
at
one
slips
into
the
room
seizes
the
leg
of
mutton
and
slips
out
again
when
this
happened
i
could
not
yet
talk
the
accomplishment
of
speech
came
to
me
very
late
doubtless
because
i
never
heard
young
voices
many
years
later
when
i
mentioned
this
recollection
there
was
a
shout
of
laughter
and
surprise
then
was
what
became
of
the
mutton
it
was
not
you
who
as
your
uncle
pretended
ate
it
up
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
bone
and
all
i
suppose
that
it
was
the
startling
intensity
of
this
incident
which
stamped
it
upon
a
memory
from
which
all
other
impressions
of
this
early
date
have
vanished
the
adventure
of
the
leg
of
mutton
occurred
evidently
at
the
house
of
my
mother
brothers
for
my
parents
at
this
date
visited
no
other
my
uncles
were
not
religious
men
but
they
had
an
almost
filial
respect
for
my
mother
who
was
several
years
senior
to
the
elder
of
them
when
the
catastrophe
of
my
grandfather
fortune
had
occurred
they
had
not
yet
left
school
my
mother
in
spite
of
an
extreme
dislike
of
teaching
which
was
native
to
her
immediately
accepted
the
situation
of
a
governess
in
the
family
of
an
irish
nobleman
the
mansion
was
only
to
be
approached
as
miss
edgeworth
would
have
said
eighteen
sloughs
at
the
imminent
peril
of
one
life
and
when
one
had
reached
it
the
mixture
of
opulence
and
squalor
of
civility
and
savagery
was
unspeakable
but
my
mother
was
well
paid
and
she
stayed
in
this
distasteful
environment
doing
the
work
she
hated
most
while
with
the
margin
of
her
salary
she
helped
first
one
of
her
brothers
and
then
the
other
through
his
cambridge
course
they
studied
hard
and
did
well
at
the
university
at
length
their
sister
received
in
her
thule
news
that
her
younger
brother
had
taken
his
degree
and
then
and
there
with
a
sigh
of
intense
relief
she
resigned
her
situation
and
came
straight
back
to
england
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
then
that
my
uncles
looked
up
to
their
sister
with
feelings
of
especial
devotion
they
were
not
inclined
they
were
hardly
in
a
position
to
criticize
her
modes
of
thought
they
were
cultured
and
kindly
gentlemen
rather
limited
in
their
views
without
a
trace
of
their
force
of
intellect
or
her
strenuous
temper
resembled
her
in
person
he
was
tall
fair
with
auburn
curls
he
cultivated
a
certain
tendency
to
the
byronic
type
fatal
and
melancholy
was
short
brown
and
jocose
with
a
pretension
to
common
sense
bluff
and
chatty
as
a
little
child
i
adored
my
uncle
who
sat
silent
by
the
fireside
holding
me
against
his
knee
saying
nothing
but
looking
unutterably
sad
and
occasionally
shaking
his
tresses
with
great
injustice
on
the
other
hand
i
detested
my
uncle
because
he
used
to
joke
in
a
manner
very
displeasing
to
me
and
because
he
would
so
far
forget
himself
as
to
chase
and
even
if
it
will
be
credited
to
tickle
me
my
uncles
who
remained
bachelors
to
the
end
of
their
lives
earned
a
comfortable
living
by
teaching
as
in
the
city
and
they
rented
an
old
rambling
house
in
clapton
that
same
in
which
i
saw
the
greyhound
their
house
had
a
strange
delicious
smell
so
unlike
anything
i
smelt
anywhere
else
that
it
used
to
fill
my
eyes
with
tears
of
mysterious
pleasure
i
know
now
that
this
was
the
odour
of
cigars
tobacco
being
a
species
of
incense
tabooed
at
home
on
the
highest
religious
grounds
it
has
been
recorded
that
i
was
slow
in
learning
to
speak
i
used
to
be
told
that
having
met
all
invitations
to
repeat
such
words
as
and
with
gravity
and
indifference
i
one
day
drew
towards
me
a
volume
and
said
with
startling
distinctness
i
was
not
at
all
precocious
but
at
a
rather
early
age
i
think
towards
the
beginning
of
my
fourth
year
i
learned
to
read
i
can
not
recollect
a
time
when
a
printed
page
of
english
was
closed
to
me
but
perhaps
earlier
still
my
mother
used
to
repeat
to
me
a
poem
which
i
have
always
taken
for
granted
that
she
had
herself
composed
a
poem
which
had
a
romantic
place
in
my
early
mental
history
it
ran
thus
i
think
o
pretty
moon
you
shine
so
bright
i
go
to
bid
mamma
and
then
i
lie
upon
my
bed
and
watch
you
move
above
my
head
ah
there
a
cloud
has
hidden
you
but
i
can
see
your
light
shine
thro
it
tries
to
hide
you
quite
in
vain
for
there
you
quickly
come
again
it
god
i
know
that
makes
you
shine
upon
this
little
bed
of
mine
but
i
shall
all
about
you
know
when
i
can
read
and
older
grow
long
long
after
the
last
line
had
become
an
anachronism
i
used
to
shout
this
poem
from
my
bed
before
i
went
to
sleep
whether
the
night
happened
to
be
moonlit
or
no
it
must
have
been
my
father
who
taught
me
my
letters
to
my
mother
as
i
have
said
it
was
distasteful
to
teach
though
she
was
so
prompt
and
skillful
to
learn
my
father
on
the
contrary
taught
cheerfully
by
fits
and
starts
in
particular
he
had
a
scheme
for
rationalizing
geography
which
i
think
was
admirable
i
was
to
climb
upon
a
chair
while
standing
at
my
side
with
a
pencil
and
a
sheet
of
paper
he
was
to
draw
a
chart
of
the
markings
on
the
carpet
then
when
i
understood
the
system
another
chart
on
a
smaller
scale
of
the
furniture
in
the
room
then
of
a
floor
of
the
house
then
of
the
then
of
a
section
of
the
street
the
result
of
this
was
that
geography
came
to
me
of
itself
as
a
perfectly
natural
miniature
arrangement
of
objects
and
to
this
day
has
always
been
the
science
which
gives
me
least
difficulty
my
father
also
taught
me
the
simple
rules
of
arithmetic
a
little
natural
history
and
the
elements
of
drawing
and
he
laboured
long
and
unsuccessfully
to
make
me
learn
by
heart
hymns
psalms
and
chapters
of
scripture
in
which
i
always
failed
ignominiously
and
with
tears
this
puzzled
and
vexed
him
for
he
himself
had
an
extremely
retentive
textual
memory
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
i
was
naughty
and
would
not
learn
the
chapters
until
at
last
he
gave
up
the
effort
all
this
sketch
of
an
education
began
i
believe
in
my
fourth
year
and
was
not
advanced
or
modified
during
the
rest
of
my
life
meanwhile
capable
as
i
was
of
reading
i
found
my
greatest
pleasure
in
the
pages
of
books
the
range
of
these
was
limited
for
of
every
description
were
sternly
excluded
no
fiction
of
any
kind
religious
or
secular
was
admitted
into
the
house
in
this
it
was
to
my
mother
not
to
my
father
that
the
prohibition
was
due
she
had
a
remarkable
i
confess
to
me
still
somewhat
unaccountable
impression
that
to
a
story
that
is
to
compose
fictitious
narrative
of
any
kind
was
a
sin
she
carried
this
conviction
to
extreme
lengths
my
father
in
later
years
gave
me
some
interesting
examples
of
her
firmness
as
a
young
man
in
america
he
had
been
deeply
impressed
by
a
pious
prose
romance
by
that
then
popular
writer
the
rev
george
croly
when
he
first
met
my
mother
he
recommended
it
to
her
but
she
would
not
consent
to
open
it
nor
would
she
read
the
chivalrous
tales
in
verse
of
sir
walter
scott
obstinately
alleging
that
they
were
not
she
would
read
none
but
lyrical
and
subjective
poetry
her
secret
diary
reveals
the
history
of
this
singular
aversion
to
the
fictitious
although
it
can
not
be
said
to
explain
the
cause
of
it
as
a
child
however
she
had
possessed
a
passion
for
making
up
stories
and
so
considerable
a
skill
in
it
that
she
was
constantly
being
begged
to
indulge
others
with
its
exercise
but
i
will
on
so
curious
a
point
leave
her
to
speak
for
herself
i
was
a
very
little
child
i
used
to
amuse
myself
and
my
brothers
with
inventing
stories
such
as
i
read
having
as
i
suppose
naturally
a
restless
mind
and
busy
imagination
this
soon
became
the
chief
pleasure
of
my
life
unfortunately
my
brothers
were
always
fond
of
encouraging
this
propensity
and
i
found
in
taylor
my
maid
a
still
greater
tempter
i
had
not
known
there
was
any
harm
in
it
until
miss
shore
a
calvinist
governess
finding
it
out
lectured
me
severely
and
told
me
it
was
wicked
from
that
time
forth
i
considered
that
to
invent
a
story
of
any
kind
was
a
sin
but
the
desire
to
do
so
was
too
deeply
rooted
in
my
affections
to
be
resisted
in
my
own
strength
she
was
at
that
time
nine
years
of
age
and
unfortunately
i
knew
neither
my
corruption
nor
my
weakness
nor
did
i
know
where
to
gain
strength
the
longing
to
invent
stories
grew
with
violence
everything
i
heard
or
read
became
food
for
my
distemper
the
simplicity
of
truth
was
not
sufficient
for
me
i
must
needs
embroider
imagination
upon
it
and
the
folly
vanity
and
wickedness
which
disgraced
my
heart
are
more
than
i
am
able
to
express
even
now
at
the
age
of
tho
watched
prayed
and
striven
against
this
is
still
the
sin
that
most
easily
besets
me
it
has
hindered
my
prayers
and
prevented
my
improvement
and
therefore
has
humbled
me
very
much
this
is
surely
a
very
painful
instance
of
the
repression
of
an
instinct
there
seems
to
have
been
in
this
case
a
vocation
such
as
is
rarely
heard
and
still
less
often
wilfully
disregarded
and
silenced
was
my
mother
intended
by
nature
to
be
a
novelist
i
have
often
thought
so
and
her
talents
and
vigour
of
purpose
directed
along
the
line
which
was
ready
to
form
chief
pleasure
of
her
life
could
hardly
have
failed
to
conduct
her
to
great
success
she
was
a
little
younger
than
bulwer
lytton
a
little
older
than
gaskell
but
these
are
vain
and
trivial
speculations
my
own
state
however
was
i
should
think
almost
unique
among
the
children
of
cultivated
parents
in
consequence
of
the
stern
ordinance
which
i
have
described
not
a
single
fiction
was
read
or
told
to
me
during
my
infancy
the
rapture
of
the
child
who
delays
the
process
of
going
to
bed
by
cajoling
story
out
of
his
mother
or
his
nurse
as
he
sits
upon
her
knee
well
tucked
up
at
the
corner
of
the
nursery
fire
this
was
unknown
to
me
never
in
all
my
early
childhood
did
anyone
address
to
me
the
affecting
preamble
upon
a
time
i
was
told
about
missionaries
but
never
about
pirates
i
was
familiar
with
hummingbirds
but
i
had
never
heard
of
fairies
jack
the
killer
rumpelstiltskin
and
robin
hood
were
not
of
my
acquaintance
and
though
i
understood
about
wolves
little
red
ridinghood
was
a
stranger
even
by
name
so
far
as
my
was
concerned
i
can
but
think
that
my
parents
were
in
error
thus
to
exclude
the
imaginary
from
my
outlook
upon
facts
they
desired
to
make
me
truthful
the
tendency
was
to
make
me
positive
and
sceptical
had
they
wrapped
me
in
the
soft
folds
of
supernatural
fancy
my
mind
might
have
been
longer
content
to
follow
their
traditions
in
an
unquestioning
spirit
having
easily
said
what
in
those
early
years
i
did
not
read
i
have
great
difficulty
in
saying
what
i
did
read
but
a
queer
variety
of
natural
history
some
of
it
quite
indigestible
by
my
undeveloped
mind
many
books
of
travels
mainly
of
a
scientific
character
among
them
voyages
of
discovery
in
the
south
seas
by
which
my
brain
was
dimly
filled
with
splendour
some
geography
and
astronomy
both
of
them
sincerely
enjoyed
much
theology
which
i
desired
to
appreciate
but
could
never
get
my
teeth
into
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
and
over
which
my
eye
and
tongue
learned
to
slip
without
penetrating
so
that
i
would
read
and
read
aloud
and
with
great
propriety
of
emphasis
page
after
page
without
having
formed
an
idea
or
retained
an
expression
there
was
for
instance
a
writer
on
prophecy
called
jukes
of
whose
works
each
of
my
parents
was
inordinately
fond
and
i
was
early
set
to
read
jukes
aloud
to
them
i
did
it
glibly
like
a
machine
but
the
sight
of
jukes
volumes
became
an
abomination
to
me
and
i
never
formed
the
outline
of
a
notion
what
they
were
about
later
on
a
publication
called
penny
became
my
daily
and
for
a
long
time
almost
my
sole
study
to
the
subject
of
this
remarkable
work
i
may
presently
return
it
is
difficult
to
keep
anything
like
chronological
order
in
recording
fragments
of
early
recollection
and
in
speaking
of
my
reading
i
have
been
led
too
far
ahead
my
memory
does
not
practically
begin
till
we
returned
from
certain
visits
made
with
a
zoological
purpose
to
the
shores
of
devon
and
dorset
and
settled
early
in
my
fifth
year
in
a
house
at
islington
in
the
north
of
london
our
circumstances
were
now
more
easy
my
father
had
regular
and
literary
work
and
the
house
was
larger
and
more
comfortable
than
ever
before
though
still
very
simple
and
restricted
my
memories
some
of
which
are
exactly
dated
by
certain
facts
now
become
clear
and
almost
abundant
what
i
do
not
remember
except
from
having
it
very
often
repeated
to
me
is
what
may
be
considered
the
only
thing
that
i
said
during
an
otherwise
unillustrious
childhood
it
was
not
startlingly
but
it
may
pass
a
lady
when
i
was
just
four
rather
injudiciously
showed
me
a
large
print
of
a
human
skeleton
saying
you
do
know
what
that
is
do
you
upon
which
immediately
and
very
archly
i
replied
it
a
man
with
the
meat
off
this
was
thought
wonderful
and
as
it
is
supposed
that
i
had
never
had
the
phenomenon
explained
to
me
it
certainly
displays
some
quickness
in
seizing
an
analogy
i
had
often
watched
my
father
while
he
soaked
the
flesh
off
the
bones
of
fishes
and
small
mammals
if
i
venture
to
repeat
this
trifle
it
is
only
to
point
out
that
the
system
on
which
i
was
being
educated
deprived
all
things
human
life
among
the
rest
of
their
mystery
the
skeleton
of
death
was
to
me
merely
a
prepared
specimen
of
that
featherless
plantigrade
vertebrate
sapiens
as
i
have
said
that
this
anecdote
was
thought
worth
repeating
i
ought
to
proceed
to
say
that
there
was
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
none
of
that
flattery
of
childhood
which
is
so
often
merely
a
backhanded
way
of
indulging
the
vanity
of
parents
my
mother
indeed
would
hardly
have
been
human
if
she
had
not
occasionally
entertained
herself
with
the
delusion
that
her
solitary
duckling
was
a
cygnet
this
my
father
did
not
encourage
remarking
with
great
affection
and
chucking
me
under
the
chin
that
i
was
nice
little
ordinary
boy
my
mother
stung
by
this
want
of
appreciation
would
proceed
so
far
as
to
declare
that
she
believed
that
in
future
times
the
would
be
chiefly
known
as
his
son
father
this
is
a
pleasantry
frequent
in
professional
families
to
this
my
father
whether
convinced
or
not
would
make
no
demur
and
the
couple
would
begin
to
discuss
in
my
presence
the
direction
which
my
shining
talents
would
take
in
consequence
of
my
dedication
to
lord
service
the
range
of
possibilities
was
much
restricted
my
father
who
had
lived
long
in
the
tropics
and
who
nursed
a
perpetual
nostalgia
for
little
lazy
isles
where
the
blow
leaned
towards
the
field
of
missionary
labour
my
mother
who
was
cold
about
foreign
missions
preferred
to
believe
that
i
should
be
the
charles
wesley
of
my
age
perhaps
she
had
the
candour
to
admit
the
george
whitefield
i
can
not
recollect
the
time
when
i
did
not
understand
that
i
was
going
to
be
a
minister
of
the
gospel
it
is
so
generally
taken
for
granted
that
a
life
strictly
dedicated
to
religion
is
stiff
and
dreary
that
i
may
have
some
difficulty
in
persuading
my
readers
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
these
early
days
of
my
childhood
before
disease
and
death
had
penetrated
to
our
slender
society
we
were
always
cheerful
and
often
gay
my
parents
were
playful
with
one
another
and
there
were
certain
stock
family
jests
which
seldom
failed
to
enliven
the
breakfast
table
my
father
and
mother
lived
so
completely
in
the
atmosphere
of
faith
and
were
so
utterly
convinced
of
their
intercourse
with
god
that
so
long
as
that
intercourse
was
not
clouded
by
sin
to
which
they
were
delicately
sensitive
they
could
afford
to
take
the
passing
hour
very
lightly
they
would
even
to
a
certain
extent
treat
the
surroundings
of
their
religion
as
a
subject
of
jest
joking
very
mildly
and
gently
about
such
things
as
an
attitude
at
prayer
or
the
nature
of
a
supplication
they
were
absolutely
indifferent
to
forms
they
prayed
seated
in
their
chairs
as
willingly
as
reversed
upon
their
knees
no
ritual
having
any
significance
for
them
my
mother
was
sometimes
extremely
gay
laughing
with
a
soft
merry
sound
what
i
have
since
been
told
of
the
guileless
mirth
of
nuns
in
a
convent
has
reminded
me
of
the
gaiety
of
my
parents
during
my
early
childhood
so
long
as
i
was
a
mere
part
of
them
without
individual
existence
and
swept
on
a
satellite
in
their
atmosphere
i
was
mirthful
when
they
were
mirthful
and
grave
when
they
were
grave
the
mere
fact
that
i
had
no
young
companions
no
storybooks
no
outdoor
amusements
none
of
the
thousand
and
one
employments
provided
for
other
children
in
more
conventional
surroundings
did
not
make
me
discontented
or
fretful
because
i
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
such
entertainments
in
exchange
i
became
keenly
attentive
to
the
limited
circle
of
interests
open
to
me
oddly
enough
i
have
no
recollection
of
any
curiosity
about
other
children
nor
of
any
desire
to
speak
to
them
or
play
with
them
they
did
not
enter
into
my
dreams
which
were
occupied
entirely
with
people
and
animals
i
had
three
dolls
to
whom
my
attitude
was
not
very
intelligible
two
of
these
were
female
one
with
a
shapeless
face
of
rags
the
other
in
wax
but
in
my
fifth
year
when
the
crimean
war
broke
out
i
was
given
a
third
doll
a
soldier
dressed
very
smartly
in
a
scarlet
cloth
tunic
i
used
to
put
the
dolls
on
three
chairs
and
harangue
them
aloud
but
my
sentiment
to
them
was
never
confidential
until
our
one
day
intruding
on
my
audience
and
misunderstanding
the
occasion
of
it
said
a
boy
and
playing
with
a
soldier
when
he
got
two
to
play
with
i
had
never
thought
of
my
dolls
as
confidants
before
but
from
that
time
forth
i
paid
a
special
attention
to
the
soldier
in
order
to
make
up
to
him
for
lizzie
unwarrantable
insult
the
declaration
of
war
with
russia
brought
the
first
breath
of
outside
life
into
our
calvinist
cloister
my
parents
took
in
a
daily
newspaper
which
they
had
never
done
before
and
events
in
picturesque
places
which
my
father
and
i
looked
out
on
the
map
were
eagerly
discussed
one
of
my
vividest
early
memories
can
be
dated
exactly
i
was
playing
about
the
house
and
suddenly
burst
into
the
where
close
to
the
door
sat
an
amazing
figure
a
very
tall
young
man
as
stiff
as
my
doll
in
a
gorgeous
scarlet
tunic
quite
far
away
from
him
at
her
my
mother
sat
with
her
bible
open
before
her
and
was
urging
the
gospel
plan
of
salvation
on
his
acceptance
she
promptly
told
me
to
run
away
and
play
but
i
had
seen
a
great
sight
this
guardsman
was
in
the
act
of
leaving
for
the
crimea
and
his
adventures
he
was
converted
in
consequence
of
my
instruction
were
afterwards
told
by
her
in
a
tract
called
guardsman
of
the
alma
of
which
i
believe
that
more
than
half
a
million
copies
were
circulated
he
was
killed
in
that
battle
and
this
added
an
extraordinary
lustre
to
my
dream
of
him
i
see
him
still
in
my
mind
eye
large
stiff
and
unspeakably
brilliant
seated
from
respect
as
near
as
possible
to
our
parlour
door
this
apparition
gave
reality
to
my
subsequent
conversations
with
the
soldier
doll
that
same
victory
of
the
alma
which
was
reported
in
london
on
my
fifth
birthday
is
also
marked
very
clearly
in
my
memory
by
a
family
circumstance
we
were
seated
at
breakfast
at
our
small
round
table
drawn
close
up
to
the
window
my
father
with
his
back
to
the
light
suddenly
he
gave
a
sort
of
cry
and
read
out
the
opening
sentences
from
announcing
a
battle
in
the
valley
of
the
alma
no
doubt
the
strain
of
national
anxiety
had
been
very
great
for
both
he
and
my
mother
seemed
deeply
excited
he
broke
off
his
reading
when
the
fact
of
the
decisive
victory
was
assured
and
he
and
my
mother
sank
simultaneously
on
their
knees
in
front
of
their
tea
and
while
in
a
loud
voice
my
father
gave
thanks
to
the
god
of
battles
this
patriotism
was
the
more
remarkable
in
that
he
had
schooled
himself
as
he
believed
to
put
his
citizenship
above
all
earthly
duties
to
those
who
said
you
are
a
christian
surely
you
are
not
less
an
englishman
he
would
reply
by
shaking
his
head
and
by
saying
am
a
citizen
of
no
earthly
state
he
did
not
realize
that
in
reality
and
to
use
a
cant
phrase
not
yet
coined
in
there
existed
in
great
britain
no
more
thorough
than
he
another
instance
of
the
remarkable
way
in
which
the
interests
of
daily
life
were
mingled
in
our
strange
household
with
the
practice
of
religion
made
an
impression
upon
my
memory
we
had
all
three
been
much
excited
by
a
report
that
a
certain
dark
generated
in
underground
stables
had
been
met
with
in
islington
its
name
i
think
is
fuliginaria
and
i
believe
that
it
is
excessively
rare
in
england
we
were
sitting
at
family
prayers
on
a
summer
morning
i
think
in
when
through
the
open
window
a
brown
moth
came
sailing
my
mother
immediately
interrupted
the
reading
of
the
bible
by
saying
to
my
father
henry
do
you
think
that
can
be
boletobia
my
father
rose
up
from
the
sacred
book
examined
the
insect
which
had
now
perched
and
replied
it
is
only
the
common
vapourer
orgyia
antiqua
resuming
his
seat
and
the
exposition
of
the
word
without
any
apology
or
embarrassment
in
the
course
of
this
my
sixth
year
there
happened
a
series
of
minute
and
soundless
incidents
which
elementary
as
they
may
seem
when
told
were
second
in
real
importance
to
none
in
my
mental
history
the
recollection
of
them
confirms
me
in
the
opinion
that
certain
leading
features
in
each
human
soul
are
inherent
to
it
and
can
not
be
accounted
for
by
suggestion
or
training
in
my
own
case
i
was
most
carefully
withdrawn
like
princess
blanchefleur
in
her
marble
fortress
from
every
outside
influence
whatever
yet
to
me
the
instinctive
life
came
as
unexpectedly
as
her
lover
came
to
her
in
the
basket
of
roses
what
came
to
me
was
the
consciousness
of
self
as
a
force
and
as
a
companion
and
it
came
as
the
result
of
one
or
two
shocks
which
i
will
relate
in
consequence
of
hearing
so
much
about
an
omniscient
god
a
being
of
supernatural
wisdom
and
penetration
who
was
always
with
us
who
made
in
fact
a
fourth
in
our
company
i
had
come
to
think
of
him
not
without
awe
but
with
absolute
confidence
my
father
and
mother
in
their
serene
discipline
of
me
never
argued
with
one
another
never
even
differed
their
wills
seemed
absolutely
one
my
mother
always
deferred
to
my
father
and
in
his
absence
spoke
of
him
to
me
as
if
he
were
i
confused
him
in
some
sense
with
god
at
all
events
i
believed
that
my
father
knew
everything
and
saw
everything
one
morning
in
my
sixth
year
my
mother
and
i
were
alone
in
the
when
my
father
came
in
and
announced
some
fact
to
us
i
was
standing
on
the
rug
gazing
at
him
and
when
he
made
this
statement
i
remember
turning
quickly
in
embarrassment
and
looking
into
the
fire
the
shock
to
me
was
as
that
of
a
thunderbolt
for
what
my
father
had
said
not
true
my
mother
and
i
who
had
been
present
at
the
trifling
incident
were
aware
that
it
had
not
happened
exactly
as
it
had
been
reported
to
him
my
mother
gently
told
him
so
and
he
accepted
the
correction
nothing
could
possibly
have
been
more
trifling
to
my
parents
but
to
me
it
meant
an
epoch
here
was
the
appalling
discovery
never
suspected
before
that
my
father
was
not
as
god
and
did
not
know
everything
the
shock
was
not
caused
by
any
suspicion
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth
as
it
appeared
to
him
but
by
the
awful
proof
that
he
was
not
as
i
had
supposed
omniscient
this
experience
was
followed
by
another
which
confirmed
the
first
but
carried
me
a
great
deal
further
in
our
little
my
father
had
built
up
a
rockery
for
ferns
and
mosses
and
from
the
of
the
house
he
had
drawn
a
leaden
pipe
so
that
it
pierced
upwards
through
the
rockery
and
produced
when
a
tap
was
turned
a
pretty
silvery
parasol
of
water
the
pipe
was
exposed
somewhere
near
the
foot
of
the
rockery
one
day
two
workmen
who
were
doing
some
repairs
left
their
tools
during
the
in
the
and
as
i
was
marching
about
i
suddenly
thought
that
to
see
whether
one
of
these
tools
could
make
a
hole
in
the
pipe
would
be
attractive
it
did
make
such
a
hole
quite
easily
and
then
the
matter
escaped
my
mind
but
a
day
or
two
afterwards
when
my
father
came
in
to
dinner
he
was
very
angry
he
had
turned
the
tap
and
instead
of
the
fountain
arching
at
the
summit
there
had
been
a
rush
of
water
through
a
hole
at
the
foot
the
rockery
was
absolutely
ruined
of
course
i
realized
in
a
moment
what
i
had
done
and
i
sat
frozen
with
alarm
waiting
to
be
denounced
but
my
mother
remarked
on
the
visit
of
the
plumbers
two
or
three
days
before
and
my
father
instantly
took
up
the
suggestion
no
doubt
that
was
it
the
mischievous
fellows
had
thought
it
amusing
to
stab
the
pipe
and
spoil
the
fountain
no
suspicion
fell
on
me
no
question
was
asked
of
me
i
sat
there
turned
to
stone
within
but
outwardly
sympathetic
and
with
unchecked
appetite
we
attribute
i
believe
too
many
moral
ideas
to
little
children
it
is
obvious
that
in
this
tremendous
juncture
i
ought
to
have
been
urged
forward
by
good
instincts
or
held
back
by
naughty
ones
but
i
am
sure
that
the
fear
which
i
experienced
for
a
short
time
and
which
so
unexpectedly
melted
away
was
a
purely
physical
one
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
motions
of
a
contrite
heart
as
to
the
destruction
of
the
fountain
i
was
sorry
about
that
for
my
own
sake
since
i
admired
the
skipping
water
extremely
and
had
had
no
idea
that
i
was
spoiling
its
display
but
the
emotions
which
now
thronged
within
me
and
which
led
me
with
an
almost
unwise
alacrity
to
seek
solitude
in
the
garden
were
not
moral
at
all
they
were
intellectual
i
was
not
ashamed
of
having
successfully
and
so
surprisingly
deceived
my
parents
by
my
crafty
silence
i
looked
upon
that
as
a
providential
escape
and
dismissed
all
further
thought
of
it
i
had
other
things
to
think
of
in
the
first
place
the
theory
that
my
father
was
omniscient
or
infallible
was
now
dead
and
buried
he
probably
knew
very
little
in
this
case
he
had
not
known
a
fact
of
such
importance
that
if
you
did
not
know
that
it
could
hardly
matter
what
you
knew
my
father
as
a
deity
as
a
natural
force
of
immense
prestige
fell
in
my
eyes
to
a
human
level
in
future
his
statements
about
things
in
general
need
not
be
accepted
implicitly
but
of
all
the
thoughts
which
rushed
upon
my
savage
and
undeveloped
little
brain
at
this
crisis
the
most
curious
was
that
i
had
found
a
companion
and
a
confidant
in
myself
there
was
a
secret
in
this
world
and
it
belonged
to
me
and
to
a
somebody
who
lived
in
the
same
body
with
me
there
were
two
of
us
and
we
could
talk
with
one
another
it
is
difficult
to
define
impressions
so
rudimentary
but
it
is
certain
that
it
was
in
this
dual
form
that
the
sense
of
my
individuality
now
suddenly
descended
upon
me
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
it
was
a
great
solace
to
me
to
find
a
sympathizer
in
my
own
breast
about
this
time
my
mother
carried
away
by
the
current
of
her
literary
and
her
philanthropic
work
left
me
more
and
more
to
my
own
devices
she
was
seized
with
a
great
enthusiasm
as
one
of
her
admirers
and
disciples
has
written
went
on
her
way
sowing
beside
all
waters
i
would
not
for
a
moment
let
it
be
supposed
that
i
regard
her
as
a
jellyby
or
that
i
think
she
neglected
me
but
a
remarkable
work
had
opened
up
before
her
after
her
long
years
in
a
mental
hermitage
she
was
drawn
forth
into
the
clamorous
of
souls
she
developed
an
unexpected
gift
of
persuasion
over
strangers
whom
she
met
in
the
omnibus
or
in
the
train
and
with
whom
she
courageously
grappled
this
began
by
her
noting
with
deep
humility
and
joy
that
have
reason
to
judge
the
sound
conversion
to
god
of
three
young
persons
within
a
few
weeks
by
the
instrumentality
of
my
conversations
with
them
at
the
same
time
as
another
of
her
biographers
has
said
testimonies
to
the
blood
of
christ
the
fruits
of
her
pen
began
to
be
spread
very
widely
even
to
the
most
distant
parts
of
the
globe
my
father
too
was
at
this
time
at
the
height
of
his
activity
after
breakfast
each
of
them
was
amply
occupied
perhaps
until
our
evenings
we
still
always
spent
together
sometimes
my
mother
took
me
with
her
on
her
day
employ
i
recollect
pleasant
rambles
through
the
city
by
her
side
and
the
act
of
looking
up
at
her
figure
soaring
above
me
but
when
all
was
done
i
had
hours
and
hours
of
complete
solitude
in
my
father
study
in
the
garden
above
all
in
the
garret
the
garret
was
a
fairy
place
it
was
a
low
lighted
from
the
roof
it
was
wholly
unfurnished
except
for
two
objects
an
ancient
and
a
still
more
ancient
the
puzzled
me
extremely
till
one
day
asking
my
father
what
it
was
i
got
a
distracted
answer
which
led
me
to
believe
that
it
was
itself
a
sort
of
hat
and
i
made
a
laborious
but
repeated
effort
to
wear
it
the
was
absolutely
empty
but
the
inside
of
the
lid
of
it
was
lined
with
sheets
of
what
i
now
know
to
have
been
a
sensational
novel
it
was
of
course
a
fragment
but
i
read
it
kneeling
on
the
bare
floor
with
indescribable
rapture
it
will
be
recollected
that
the
idea
of
fiction
of
a
deliberately
invented
story
had
been
kept
from
me
with
entire
success
i
therefore
implicitly
believed
the
tale
in
the
lid
of
the
trunk
to
be
a
true
account
of
the
sorrows
of
a
lady
of
title
who
had
to
flee
the
country
and
who
was
pursued
into
foreign
lands
by
enemies
bent
upon
her
ruin
somebody
had
an
interview
with
a
in
a
i
went
downstairs
and
looked
up
these
words
in
bailey
dictionary
but
was
left
in
darkness
as
to
what
they
had
to
do
with
the
lady
of
title
this
ridiculous
fragment
filled
me
with
delicious
fears
i
fancied
that
my
mother
who
was
out
so
much
might
be
threatened
by
dangers
of
the
same
sort
and
the
fact
that
the
narrative
came
abruptly
to
an
end
in
the
middle
of
one
of
its
most
thrilling
sentences
wound
me
up
almost
to
a
disorder
of
wonder
and
romance
the
preoccupation
of
my
parents
threw
me
more
and
more
upon
my
own
resources
but
what
are
the
resources
of
a
solitary
child
of
six
i
was
never
inclined
to
make
friends
with
servants
nor
did
our
successive
maids
proffer
so
far
as
i
recollect
any
advances
perhaps
with
my
and
my
ways
of
talking
i
did
not
seem
to
them
at
all
an
attractive
little
boy
i
continued
to
have
no
companions
or
even
acquaintances
of
my
own
age
i
am
unable
to
recollect
exchanging
two
words
with
another
child
till
after
my
mother
death
the
abundant
energy
which
my
mother
now
threw
into
her
public
work
did
not
affect
the
quietude
of
our
private
life
we
had
some
visitors
in
the
daytime
people
who
came
to
consult
one
parent
or
the
other
but
they
never
stayed
to
a
meal
and
we
never
returned
their
visits
i
do
not
quite
know
how
it
was
that
neither
of
my
parents
took
me
to
any
of
the
sights
of
london
although
i
am
sure
it
was
a
question
of
principle
with
them
notwithstanding
all
our
study
of
natural
history
i
was
never
introduced
to
live
wild
beasts
at
the
zoo
nor
to
dead
ones
at
the
british
museum
i
can
understand
better
why
we
never
visited
a
or
a
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
the
only
time
i
was
ever
taken
to
any
place
of
entertainment
was
when
my
father
and
i
paid
a
visit
long
anticipated
to
the
great
globe
in
leicester
square
this
was
a
huge
structure
the
interior
of
which
one
ascended
by
means
of
a
spiral
staircase
it
was
a
poor
affair
that
was
concave
in
it
which
should
have
been
convex
and
my
imagination
was
deeply
affronted
i
could
invent
a
far
better
great
globe
than
that
in
my
mind
eye
in
the
garret
being
so
restricted
then
and
yet
so
active
my
mind
took
refuge
in
an
infantile
species
of
natural
magic
this
contended
with
the
definite
ideas
of
religion
which
my
parents
were
continuing
with
too
mechanical
a
persistency
to
force
into
my
nature
and
it
ran
parallel
with
them
i
formed
strange
superstitions
which
i
can
only
render
intelligible
by
naming
some
concrete
examples
i
persuaded
myself
that
if
i
could
only
discover
the
proper
words
to
say
or
the
proper
passes
to
make
i
could
induce
the
gorgeous
birds
and
butterflies
in
my
father
illustrated
manuals
to
come
to
life
and
fly
out
of
the
book
leaving
holes
behind
them
i
believed
that
when
at
the
chapel
we
sang
drearily
and
slowly
loud
hymns
of
experience
and
humiliation
i
could
boom
forth
with
a
sound
equal
to
that
of
dozens
of
singers
if
i
could
only
hit
upon
the
formula
during
morning
and
evening
prayers
which
were
extremely
lengthy
and
fatiguing
i
fancied
that
one
of
my
two
selves
could
flit
up
and
sit
clinging
to
the
cornice
and
look
down
on
my
other
self
and
the
rest
of
us
if
i
could
only
find
the
key
i
laboured
for
hours
in
search
of
these
formulas
thinking
to
compass
my
ends
by
means
absolutely
irrational
for
example
i
was
convinced
that
if
i
could
only
count
consecutive
numbers
long
enough
without
losing
one
i
should
suddenly
on
reaching
some
figure
find
myself
in
possession
of
the
great
secret
i
feel
quite
sure
that
nothing
external
suggested
these
ideas
of
magic
and
i
think
it
probable
that
they
approached
the
ideas
of
savages
at
a
very
early
stage
of
development
all
this
ferment
of
mind
was
entirely
unobserved
by
my
parents
but
when
i
formed
the
belief
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
success
of
my
practical
magic
that
i
should
hurt
myself
and
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
began
in
extreme
secrecy
to
run
pins
into
my
flesh
and
bang
my
joints
with
books
no
one
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
my
mother
attention
was
drawn
to
the
fact
that
i
was
looking
the
notice
nowadays
universally
given
to
the
hygienic
rules
of
life
was
rare
fifty
years
ago
and
among
deeply
religious
people
in
particular
fatalistic
views
of
disease
prevailed
if
anyone
was
ill
it
showed
that
lord
hand
was
extended
in
chastisement
and
much
prayer
was
poured
forth
in
order
that
it
might
be
explained
to
the
sufferer
or
to
his
relations
in
what
he
or
they
had
sinned
people
would
for
instance
go
on
living
over
a
pool
working
themselves
up
into
an
agony
to
discover
how
they
had
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
lord
but
never
moving
away
as
i
became
very
pale
and
nervous
and
slept
badly
at
nights
with
visions
and
loud
screams
in
my
sleep
i
was
taken
to
a
physician
who
stripped
me
and
tapped
me
all
over
this
gave
me
some
valuable
hints
for
my
magical
practices
but
could
find
nothing
the
matter
he
recommended
whatever
physicians
in
such
cases
always
recommend
but
nothing
was
done
if
i
was
feeble
it
was
the
lord
will
and
we
must
acquiesce
it
culminated
in
a
sort
of
fit
of
hysterics
when
i
lost
all
and
sobbed
with
tears
and
banged
my
head
on
the
table
while
this
was
proceeding
i
was
conscious
of
that
dual
individuality
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
since
while
one
part
of
me
gave
way
and
could
not
resist
the
other
part
in
some
extraordinary
sense
seemed
standing
aloof
much
impressed
i
was
alone
with
my
father
when
this
crisis
suddenly
occurred
and
i
was
interested
to
see
that
he
was
greatly
alarmed
it
was
a
very
long
time
since
we
had
spent
a
day
out
of
london
and
i
said
on
being
coaxed
back
to
calmness
that
i
wanted
go
into
the
country
like
the
dying
falstaff
i
babbled
of
green
fields
my
father
after
a
little
reflection
proposed
to
take
me
to
primrose
hill
i
had
never
heard
of
the
place
and
names
have
always
appealed
directly
to
my
imagination
i
was
in
the
highest
degree
delighted
and
could
hardly
restrain
my
impatience
as
soon
as
possible
we
set
forth
westward
my
hand
in
my
father
with
the
liveliest
anticipations
i
expected
to
see
a
mountain
absolutely
carpeted
with
primroses
a
terrestrial
galaxy
like
that
which
covered
the
hill
that
led
up
to
montgomery
castle
in
donne
poem
but
at
length
as
we
walked
from
the
chalk
farm
direction
a
miserable
acclivity
stole
into
view
surrounded
even
in
those
days
on
most
sides
by
houses
with
its
grass
worn
to
the
buff
by
millions
of
boots
and
resembling
what
i
meant
by
country
about
as
much
as
poplar
resembles
paradise
we
sat
down
on
a
bench
at
its
inglorious
summit
whereupon
i
burst
into
tears
and
in
a
whisper
sobbed
papa
let
us
go
home
this
was
the
lachrymose
epoch
in
a
career
not
otherwise
given
to
weeping
for
i
must
tell
one
more
tale
of
tears
about
this
time
the
autumn
of
my
parents
were
disturbed
more
than
once
in
the
twilight
after
i
had
been
put
to
bed
by
shrieks
from
my
crib
they
would
rush
up
to
my
side
and
find
me
in
great
distress
but
would
be
unable
to
discover
the
cause
of
it
the
fact
was
that
i
was
half
beside
myself
with
ghostly
fears
increased
and
pointed
by
the
fact
that
there
had
been
some
daring
burglaries
on
our
street
our
who
slept
at
the
top
of
the
house
had
seen
or
thought
she
saw
upon
a
moonlight
night
the
figure
of
a
crouching
man
silhouetted
against
the
sky
slip
down
from
the
roof
and
leap
into
her
room
she
screamed
and
he
fled
away
moreover
as
if
this
were
not
enough
for
my
tender
nerves
there
had
been
committed
a
horrid
murder
at
a
shop
just
around
the
corner
in
the
caledonian
road
to
which
murder
actuality
was
given
to
us
by
the
fact
that
my
mother
had
been
thinking
of
getting
her
bread
from
this
shop
children
i
think
were
not
spared
the
details
of
these
affairs
fifty
years
ago
at
least
i
was
not
and
my
nerves
were
a
packet
of
spilikins
but
what
made
me
scream
at
nights
was
that
when
my
mother
had
tucked
me
up
in
bed
and
had
heard
me
say
my
prayer
and
had
prayed
aloud
on
her
knees
at
my
side
and
had
stolen
downstairs
noises
immediately
began
in
the
room
there
was
a
rustling
of
clothes
and
a
slapping
of
hands
and
a
gurgling
and
a
sniffing
and
a
trotting
these
horrible
muffled
sounds
would
go
on
and
die
away
and
be
resumed
i
would
pray
very
fervently
to
god
to
save
me
from
my
enemies
and
sometimes
i
would
go
to
sleep
but
on
other
occasions
my
faith
and
fortitude
alike
gave
way
and
i
screamed
mama
then
would
my
parents
come
bounding
up
the
stairs
and
comfort
me
and
kiss
me
and
assure
me
it
was
nothing
and
nothing
it
was
while
they
were
there
but
no
sooner
had
they
gone
than
the
ghostly
riot
recommenced
it
was
at
last
discovered
by
my
mother
that
the
whole
mischief
was
due
to
a
card
of
framed
texts
fastened
by
one
nail
to
the
wall
this
did
nothing
when
the
bedroom
door
was
shut
but
when
it
was
left
open
in
order
that
my
parents
might
hear
me
call
the
card
began
to
gallop
in
the
draught
and
made
the
most
intolerable
noises
several
things
tended
at
this
time
to
alienate
my
conscience
from
the
line
which
my
father
had
so
rigidly
traced
for
it
the
question
of
the
efficacy
of
prayer
which
has
puzzled
wiser
heads
than
mine
was
began
to
trouble
me
it
was
insisted
on
in
our
household
that
if
anything
was
desired
you
should
not
as
my
mother
said
any
time
in
seeking
for
it
but
ask
god
to
guide
you
to
it
in
many
junctures
of
life
this
is
precisely
what
in
sober
fact
they
did
i
will
not
dwell
here
on
their
theories
which
my
mother
put
forth
with
unflinching
directness
in
her
published
writings
but
i
found
that
a
difference
was
made
between
my
privileges
in
this
matter
and
theirs
and
this
led
to
many
discussions
my
parents
said
you
need
tell
him
and
he
will
grant
it
if
it
is
his
will
very
well
i
had
need
of
a
large
painted
which
i
had
seen
in
a
in
the
caledonian
road
accordingly
i
introduced
a
supplication
for
this
object
into
my
evening
prayer
carefully
adding
the
words
it
is
thy
will
this
i
recollect
placed
my
mother
in
a
dilemma
and
she
consulted
my
father
taken
i
suppose
at
a
disadvantage
my
father
told
me
i
must
not
pray
for
like
that
to
which
i
answered
by
another
query
and
i
added
that
he
said
we
ought
to
pray
for
things
we
needed
and
that
i
needed
the
a
great
deal
more
than
i
did
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
or
the
restitution
of
jerusalem
to
the
jews
two
objects
of
my
nightly
supplication
which
left
me
very
cold
i
have
reason
to
believe
looking
back
upon
this
scene
conducted
by
candlelight
in
the
front
parlour
that
my
mother
was
much
baffled
by
the
logic
of
my
argument
she
had
gone
so
far
as
to
say
publicly
that
no
or
circumstances
are
too
insignificant
to
bring
before
the
god
of
the
whole
earth
i
persisted
that
this
covered
the
case
of
the
which
was
extremely
significant
to
me
i
noticed
that
she
held
aloof
from
the
discussion
which
was
carried
on
with
some
show
of
annoyance
by
my
father
he
had
never
gone
quite
so
far
as
she
did
in
regard
to
this
question
of
praying
for
material
things
i
am
not
sure
that
she
was
convinced
that
i
ought
to
have
been
checked
but
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
it
reduced
their
favourite
theory
to
an
absurdity
for
a
small
child
to
exercise
the
privilege
he
ceased
to
argue
and
told
me
peremptorily
that
it
was
not
right
for
me
to
pray
for
things
like
and
that
i
must
do
it
no
more
his
authority
of
course
was
paramount
and
i
yielded
but
my
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
prayer
was
a
good
deal
shaken
the
fatal
suspicion
had
crossed
my
mind
that
the
reason
why
i
was
not
to
pray
for
the
top
was
because
it
was
too
expensive
for
my
parents
to
buy
that
being
the
usual
excuse
for
not
getting
things
i
wished
for
it
was
about
the
date
of
my
sixth
birthday
that
i
did
something
very
naughty
some
act
of
direct
disobedience
for
which
my
father
after
a
solemn
sermon
chastised
me
sacrificially
by
giving
me
several
cuts
with
a
cane
this
action
was
justified
as
everything
he
did
was
justified
by
reference
to
scripture
the
rod
and
spoil
the
child
i
suppose
that
there
are
some
children
of
a
sullen
and
lymphatic
temperament
who
are
smartened
up
and
made
more
by
a
whipping
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
convention
the
exercise
being
endured
i
am
told
with
pride
by
the
infants
of
our
aristocracy
but
not
tolerated
by
the
lower
classes
i
am
afraid
that
i
proved
my
inherent
vulgarity
by
being
made
not
contrite
or
humble
but
furiously
angry
by
this
caning
i
can
not
account
for
the
flame
of
rage
which
it
awakened
in
my
bosom
my
dear
excellent
father
had
beaten
me
not
very
severely
without
and
with
the
most
genuine
desire
to
improve
me
but
he
was
not
especially
so
far
as
the
to
the
lord
service
was
concerned
this
same
had
ministered
to
my
vanity
and
there
are
some
natures
which
are
not
improved
by
being
humiliated
i
have
to
confess
with
shame
that
i
went
about
the
house
for
some
days
with
a
murderous
hatred
of
my
father
locked
within
my
bosom
he
did
not
suspect
that
the
chastisement
had
not
been
wholly
efficacious
and
he
bore
me
no
malice
so
that
after
a
while
i
forgot
and
thus
forgave
him
but
i
do
not
regard
physical
punishment
as
a
wise
element
in
the
education
of
proud
and
sensitive
children
my
theological
misdeeds
culminated
however
in
an
act
so
puerile
and
preposterous
that
i
should
not
venture
to
record
it
if
it
did
not
throw
some
glimmering
of
light
on
the
subject
which
i
have
proposed
to
myself
in
writing
these
pages
my
mind
continued
to
dwell
on
the
mysterious
question
of
prayer
it
puzzled
me
greatly
to
know
why
if
we
were
god
children
and
if
he
was
watching
over
us
by
night
and
day
we
might
not
supplicate
for
toys
and
sweets
and
smart
clothes
as
well
as
for
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
just
at
this
juncture
we
had
a
special
service
at
the
room
at
which
our
attention
was
particularly
called
to
what
we
always
spoke
of
as
field
of
missionary
labour
the
east
was
represented
among
saints
by
an
excellent
irish
peer
who
had
in
his
early
youth
converted
and
married
a
lady
of
colour
this
asiatic
shared
in
our
sunday
morning
meetings
and
was
an
object
of
helpless
terror
to
me
i
shrank
from
her
amiable
caresses
and
vaguely
identified
her
with
a
personage
much
spoken
of
in
our
family
circle
the
devil
all
these
matters
drew
my
thoughts
to
the
subject
of
idolatry
which
was
severely
censured
at
the
missionary
meeting
i
examined
my
father
very
closely
as
to
the
nature
of
this
sin
and
pinned
him
down
to
the
categorical
statement
that
idolatry
consisted
in
praying
to
anyone
or
anything
but
god
himself
wood
and
stone
in
the
words
of
the
hymn
were
peculiarly
liable
to
be
bowed
down
to
by
the
heathen
in
their
blindness
i
pressed
my
father
further
on
this
subject
and
he
assured
me
that
god
would
be
very
angry
and
would
signify
his
anger
if
anyone
in
a
christian
country
bowed
down
to
wood
and
stone
i
can
not
recall
why
i
was
so
pertinacious
on
this
subject
but
i
remember
that
my
father
became
a
little
restive
under
my
i
determined
however
to
test
the
matter
for
myself
and
one
morning
when
both
my
parents
were
safely
out
of
the
house
i
prepared
for
the
great
act
of
heresy
i
was
in
the
on
the
where
with
much
labour
i
hoisted
a
small
chair
on
to
the
table
close
to
the
window
my
heart
was
now
beating
as
if
it
would
leap
out
of
my
side
but
i
pursued
my
experiment
i
knelt
down
on
the
carpet
in
front
of
the
table
and
looking
up
i
said
my
daily
prayer
in
a
loud
voice
only
substituting
the
address
chair
for
the
habitual
one
having
carried
this
act
of
idolatry
safely
through
i
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
it
was
a
fine
day
and
i
gazed
up
at
the
slip
of
white
sky
above
the
houses
opposite
and
expected
something
to
appear
in
it
god
would
certainly
exhibit
his
anger
in
some
terrible
form
and
would
chastise
my
impious
and
willful
action
i
was
very
much
alarmed
but
still
more
excited
i
breathed
the
high
sharp
air
of
defiance
but
nothing
happened
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
not
an
unusual
sound
in
the
street
presently
i
was
quite
sure
that
nothing
would
happen
i
had
committed
idolatry
flagrantly
and
deliberately
and
god
did
not
care
the
result
of
this
ridiculous
act
was
not
to
make
me
question
the
existence
and
power
of
god
those
were
forces
which
i
did
not
dream
of
ignoring
but
what
it
did
was
to
lessen
still
further
my
confidence
in
my
father
knowledge
of
the
divine
mind
my
father
had
said
positively
that
if
i
worshipped
a
thing
made
of
wood
god
would
manifest
his
anger
i
had
then
worshipped
a
chair
made
or
partly
made
of
wood
and
god
had
made
no
sign
whatever
my
father
therefore
was
not
really
acquainted
with
the
divine
practice
in
cases
of
idolatry
and
with
that
dismissing
the
subject
i
dived
again
into
the
unplumbed
depths
of
the
chapter
iii
that
i
might
die
in
my
early
childhood
was
a
thought
which
frequently
recurred
to
the
mind
of
my
mother
she
endeavoured
with
a
roman
fortitude
to
face
it
without
apprehension
soon
after
i
had
completed
my
fifth
year
she
had
written
as
follows
in
her
secret
journal
we
be
called
on
to
weep
over
the
early
grave
of
the
dear
one
whom
now
we
are
endeavouring
to
train
for
heaven
may
we
be
able
to
remember
that
we
never
ceased
to
pray
for
and
watch
over
him
it
is
easy
comparatively
to
watch
over
an
infant
yet
shall
i
be
sufficient
for
these
things
i
am
not
but
god
is
sufficient
in
his
strength
i
have
begun
the
warfare
in
his
strength
i
will
persevere
and
i
will
faint
not
until
either
i
myself
or
my
little
one
is
beyond
the
reach
of
earthly
solicitude
that
either
she
or
i
would
be
called
away
from
earth
and
that
our
physical
separation
was
at
hand
seems
to
have
been
always
vaguely
present
in
my
mother
dreams
as
an
obstinate
conviction
to
be
carefully
recognized
and
jealously
guarded
against
it
was
not
however
until
the
course
of
my
seventh
year
that
the
tragedy
occurred
which
altered
the
whole
course
of
our
family
existence
my
mother
had
hitherto
seemed
strong
and
in
good
health
she
had
even
made
the
remark
to
my
father
that
and
pain
the
badges
of
christian
discipleship
appeared
to
be
withheld
from
her
on
her
birthday
which
was
to
be
her
last
she
had
written
these
ejaculations
in
her
locked
diary
forgive
the
sins
of
the
past
and
help
me
to
be
faithful
in
future
may
this
be
a
year
of
much
blessing
a
year
of
jubilee
may
i
be
kept
lowly
trusting
loving
may
i
have
more
blessing
than
in
all
former
years
combined
may
i
be
happier
as
a
wife
mother
sister
writer
mistress
friend
but
a
symptom
began
to
alarm
her
and
in
the
beginning
of
may
having
consulted
a
local
physician
without
being
satisfied
she
went
to
see
a
specialist
in
a
northern
suburb
in
whose
judgement
she
had
great
confidence
this
occasion
i
recollect
with
extreme
vividness
i
had
been
put
to
bed
by
my
father
in
itself
a
noteworthy
event
my
crib
stood
near
a
window
overlooking
the
street
my
parents
ancient
a
relic
of
the
eighteenth
century
hid
me
from
the
door
but
i
could
see
the
rest
of
the
room
after
falling
asleep
on
this
particular
evening
i
awoke
silently
surprised
to
see
two
lighted
candles
on
the
table
and
my
father
seated
writing
by
them
i
also
saw
a
little
meal
arranged
while
i
was
wondering
at
all
this
the
door
opened
and
my
mother
entered
the
room
she
emerged
from
behind
the
with
her
bonnet
on
having
returned
from
her
expedition
my
father
rose
hurriedly
pushing
back
his
chair
there
was
a
pause
while
my
mother
seemed
to
be
steadying
her
voice
and
then
she
replied
loudly
and
distinctly
says
it
is
and
she
mentioned
one
of
the
most
cruel
maladies
by
which
our
poor
mortal
nature
can
be
tormented
then
i
saw
them
hold
one
another
in
a
silent
long
embrace
and
presently
sink
together
out
of
sight
on
their
knees
at
the
farther
side
of
the
bed
whereupon
my
father
lifted
up
his
voice
in
prayer
neither
of
them
had
noticed
me
and
now
i
lay
back
on
my
pillow
and
fell
asleep
next
morning
when
we
three
sat
at
breakfast
my
mind
reverted
to
the
scene
of
the
previous
night
with
my
eyes
on
my
plate
as
i
was
cutting
up
my
food
i
asked
casually
is
mentioning
the
disease
whose
unfamiliar
name
i
had
heard
from
my
bed
receiving
no
reply
i
looked
up
to
discover
why
my
question
was
not
answered
and
i
saw
my
parents
gazing
at
each
other
with
lamentable
eyes
in
some
way
i
know
not
how
i
was
conscious
of
the
presence
of
an
incommunicable
mystery
and
i
kept
silence
though
tortured
with
curiosity
nor
did
i
ever
repeat
my
inquiry
about
a
fortnight
later
my
mother
began
to
go
three
times
a
week
all
the
long
way
from
islington
to
pimlico
in
order
to
visit
a
certain
practitioner
who
undertook
to
apply
a
special
treatment
to
her
case
this
involved
great
fatigue
and
distress
to
her
but
so
far
as
i
was
personally
concerned
it
did
me
a
great
deal
of
good
i
invariably
accompanied
her
and
when
she
was
very
tired
and
weak
i
enjoyed
the
pride
of
believing
that
i
protected
her
the
movement
the
exercise
the
occupation
lifted
my
morbid
fears
and
superstitions
like
a
cloud
the
medical
treatment
to
which
my
poor
mother
was
subjected
was
very
painful
and
she
had
a
peculiar
sensitiveness
to
pain
she
carried
on
her
evangelical
work
as
long
as
she
possibly
could
continuing
to
converse
with
her
fellow
passengers
on
spiritual
matters
it
was
wonderful
that
a
woman
so
reserved
and
proud
as
she
by
nature
was
could
conquer
so
completely
her
natural
timidity
in
those
last
months
she
scarcely
ever
got
into
a
railway
carriage
or
into
an
omnibus
without
presently
offering
tracts
to
the
persons
sitting
within
reach
of
her
or
endeavouring
to
begin
a
conversation
with
some
one
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
blood
of
jesus
to
cleanse
the
human
heart
from
sin
her
manners
were
so
gentle
and
persuasive
she
looked
so
innocent
her
small
sparkling
features
were
lighted
up
with
so
much
benevolence
that
i
do
not
think
she
ever
met
with
discourtesy
or
roughness
imitative
imp
that
i
was
i
sometimes
took
part
in
these
strange
conversations
and
was
mightily
puffed
up
by
compliments
paid
in
whispers
to
my
infant
piety
but
my
mother
very
properly
discouraged
this
as
tending
in
me
to
spiritual
pride
if
my
parents
in
their
desire
to
separate
themselves
from
the
world
had
regretted
that
through
their
happiness
they
seemed
to
have
forfeited
the
christian
privilege
of
affliction
they
could
not
continue
to
complain
of
any
absence
of
temporal
adversity
everything
seemed
to
combine
in
the
course
of
this
fatal
year
to
harass
and
alarm
them
just
at
the
moment
when
illness
created
a
special
drain
upon
their
resources
their
slender
income
instead
of
being
increased
was
seriously
diminished
there
is
little
sympathy
felt
in
this
world
of
rhetoric
for
the
silent
sufferings
of
the
genteel
poor
yet
there
is
no
class
that
deserves
a
more
charitable
commiseration
at
the
best
of
times
the
money
which
my
parents
had
to
spend
was
an
exiguous
and
an
inelastic
sum
strictly
economical
proud
in
an
mode
now
quite
out
of
fashion
to
conceal
the
fact
of
their
poverty
painfully
scrupulous
to
avoid
giving
inconvenience
to
tradesmen
or
servants
their
whole
financial
career
had
to
be
carried
on
with
the
adroitness
of
a
campaign
through
a
hostile
country
but
now
at
the
moment
when
fresh
pressing
claims
were
made
on
their
resources
my
small
capital
suddenly
disappeared
it
had
been
placed
on
bad
advice
they
were
as
children
in
such
matters
in
a
cornish
mine
the
grotesque
name
of
which
wheal
maria
became
familiar
to
my
ears
one
day
the
river
tamar
in
a
playful
mood
broke
into
wheal
maria
and
not
a
penny
more
was
ever
lifted
from
that
unfortunate
enterprise
about
the
same
time
a
small
annuity
which
my
mother
had
inherited
also
ceased
to
be
paid
on
my
father
books
and
lectures
therefore
the
whole
weight
now
rested
and
that
at
a
moment
when
he
was
depressed
and
unnerved
by
anxiety
it
was
contrary
to
his
principles
to
borrow
money
so
that
it
became
necessary
to
pay
doctor
and
bills
punctually
and
yet
to
carry
on
the
little
household
with
the
very
small
margin
each
artifice
of
economy
was
now
exercised
to
enable
this
to
be
done
without
falling
into
debt
and
every
branch
of
expenditure
was
cut
down
clothes
books
the
little
garden
which
was
my
father
pride
all
felt
the
pressure
of
new
poverty
even
our
food
which
had
always
been
simple
now
became
spartan
indeed
and
i
am
sure
that
my
mother
often
pretended
to
have
no
appetite
that
there
might
remain
enough
to
satisfy
my
hunger
fortunately
my
father
was
able
to
take
us
away
in
the
autumn
for
six
weeks
by
the
sea
in
wales
the
expenses
of
this
tour
being
paid
for
by
a
professional
engagement
so
that
my
seventh
birthday
was
spent
in
an
ecstasy
of
happiness
on
golden
sands
under
a
brilliant
sky
and
in
sight
of
the
glorious
azure
ocean
beating
in
from
an
infinitude
of
melting
horizons
here
too
my
mother
perched
in
a
nook
of
the
high
rocks
surveyed
the
west
and
forgot
for
a
little
while
her
weakness
and
the
gnawing
grinding
pain
but
in
october
our
sorrows
seemed
to
close
in
upon
us
we
went
back
to
london
and
for
the
first
time
in
their
married
life
my
parents
were
divided
my
mother
was
now
so
seriously
weaker
that
the
omnibus
journeys
to
pimlico
became
impossible
my
father
could
not
leave
his
work
and
so
my
mother
and
i
had
to
take
a
gloomy
lodging
close
to
the
doctor
house
the
experiences
upon
which
i
presently
entered
were
of
a
nature
in
which
childhood
rarely
takes
a
part
i
was
now
my
mother
sole
and
ceaseless
companion
the
silent
witness
of
her
suffering
of
her
patience
of
her
vain
and
delusive
attempts
to
obtain
alleviation
of
her
anguish
for
nearly
three
months
i
breathed
the
atmosphere
of
pain
saw
no
other
light
heard
no
other
sounds
thought
no
other
thoughts
than
those
which
accompany
physical
suffering
and
weariness
to
my
memory
these
weeks
seem
years
i
have
no
measure
of
their
monotony
the
lodgings
were
bare
and
yet
tawdry
out
of
dingy
windows
we
looked
from
a
second
storey
upon
a
dull
small
street
drowned
in
autumnal
fog
my
father
came
to
see
us
when
he
could
but
otherwise
save
when
we
made
our
morning
expedition
to
the
doctor
or
when
a
slatternly
girl
waited
upon
us
with
our
distasteful
meals
we
were
alone
without
any
other
occupation
than
to
look
forward
to
that
occasional
abatement
of
suffering
which
was
what
we
hoped
for
most
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
recollect
how
these
interminable
hours
were
spent
but
i
read
aloud
in
a
great
part
of
them
i
have
now
in
my
mind
cabinet
a
picture
of
my
chair
turned
towards
the
window
partly
that
i
might
see
the
book
more
distinctly
partly
not
to
see
quite
so
distinctly
that
dear
patient
figure
rocking
on
her
sofa
or
leaning
like
a
funeral
statue
like
a
muse
upon
a
monument
with
her
head
on
her
arms
against
the
mantelpiece
i
read
the
bible
every
day
and
at
much
length
also
with
i
can
not
but
think
some
praiseworthy
patience
a
book
of
incommunicable
dreariness
called
newton
on
the
apocalypse
newton
bore
a
great
resemblance
to
my
old
aversion
jukes
and
i
made
a
sort
of
playful
compact
with
my
mother
that
if
i
read
aloud
a
certain
number
of
pages
out
of
on
the
apocalypse
as
a
reward
i
should
be
allowed
to
recite
own
favourite
hymns
among
these
there
was
one
which
united
her
suffrages
with
mine
both
of
us
extremely
admired
the
piece
by
toplady
which
begins
what
though
my
frail
eyelids
refuse
continual
watchings
to
keep
and
punctual
as
midnight
renews
demand
the
refreshment
of
sleep
to
this
day
i
can
not
repeat
this
hymn
without
a
sense
of
poignant
emotion
nor
can
i
pretend
to
decide
how
much
of
this
is
due
to
its
merit
and
how
much
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
memories
it
recalls
but
it
might
be
as
rude
as
i
genuinely
think
it
to
be
skilful
and
i
should
continue
to
regard
it
as
a
sacred
poem
among
all
my
childish
memories
none
is
clearer
than
my
looking
up
after
reading
in
my
high
treble
kind
author
and
ground
of
my
hope
thee
thee
for
my
god
i
avow
my
glad
ebenezer
set
up
and
own
thou
hast
help
me
till
now
i
muse
on
the
years
that
are
past
wherein
my
defence
thou
hast
prov
nor
wilt
thou
relinquish
at
last
a
sinner
so
signally
lov
and
hearing
my
mother
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
and
her
alabastrine
fingers
tightly
locked
together
murmur
in
unconscious
repetition
nor
wilt
thou
relinquish
at
last
a
sinner
so
signally
lov
in
our
lodgings
at
pimlico
i
came
across
a
piece
of
verse
which
exercised
a
lasting
influence
on
my
taste
it
was
called
cameronian
dream
and
it
had
been
written
by
a
certain
james
hyslop
a
schoolmaster
on
a
i
do
not
know
how
it
came
into
my
possession
but
i
remember
it
was
adorned
by
an
extremely
dim
and
of
a
lake
surrounded
by
mountains
with
tombstones
in
the
foreground
this
lugubrious
frontispiece
positively
fascinated
me
and
lent
a
further
gloomy
charm
to
the
ballad
itself
it
was
in
this
copy
of
mediocre
verses
that
the
sense
of
romance
first
appealed
to
me
the
kind
of
which
is
connected
with
hills
and
lakes
and
the
picturesque
costumes
of
old
times
the
following
stanza
for
instance
brought
a
revelation
to
me
was
a
dream
of
those
ages
of
darkness
and
blood
when
the
minister
home
was
the
mountain
and
wood
when
in
wellwood
dark
valley
the
standard
of
zion
all
bloody
and
torn
the
heather
was
lying
i
persuaded
my
mother
to
explain
to
me
what
it
was
all
about
and
she
told
me
of
the
affliction
of
the
scottish
saints
their
flight
to
the
waters
and
the
wilderness
their
cruel
murder
while
they
were
singing
last
song
to
the
god
of
salvation
i
was
greatly
fired
and
the
following
stanza
in
particular
reached
my
ideal
of
the
sublime
the
muskets
were
flashing
the
blue
swords
were
gleaming
the
helmets
were
cleft
and
the
red
blood
was
streaming
the
heavens
grew
dark
and
the
thunder
was
rolling
when
in
wellwood
dark
muirlands
the
mighty
were
falling
twenty
years
later
i
met
with
the
only
other
person
whom
i
have
ever
encountered
who
had
even
heard
of
cameronian
dream
this
was
robert
louis
stevenson
who
had
been
greatly
struck
by
it
when
he
was
about
my
age
probably
the
same
ephemeral
edition
of
it
reached
at
the
same
time
each
of
our
pious
households
as
my
mother
illness
progressed
she
could
neither
sleep
save
by
the
use
of
opiates
nor
rest
except
in
a
sloping
posture
propped
up
by
many
pillows
it
was
my
great
joy
and
a
pleasant
diversion
to
be
allowed
to
shift
beat
up
and
rearrange
these
pillows
a
task
which
i
learned
to
accomplish
not
too
awkwardly
her
sufferings
i
believe
were
principally
caused
by
the
violence
of
the
medicaments
to
which
her
doctor
who
was
trying
a
new
and
fantastic
thought
it
proper
to
subject
her
let
those
who
take
a
pessimistic
view
of
our
social
progress
ask
themselves
whether
such
tortures
could
today
be
inflicted
on
a
delicate
patient
or
whether
that
patient
would
be
allowed
to
exist
in
the
greatest
misery
in
a
lodging
with
no
professional
nurse
to
wait
upon
her
and
with
no
companion
but
a
little
helpless
boy
of
seven
years
of
age
time
passes
smoothly
and
swiftly
and
we
do
not
perceive
the
mitigations
which
he
brings
in
his
hands
everywhere
in
the
whole
system
of
human
life
improvements
alleviations
ingenious
appliances
and
humane
inventions
are
being
introduced
to
lessen
the
great
burden
of
suffering
if
we
were
suddenly
transplanted
into
the
world
of
only
fifty
years
ago
we
should
be
startled
and
even
by
the
wretchedness
to
which
the
step
backwards
would
reintroduce
us
it
was
in
the
very
year
of
which
i
am
speaking
a
year
of
which
my
personal
memories
are
still
vivid
that
sir
james
simpson
received
the
monthyon
prize
as
a
recognition
of
his
discovery
of
the
use
of
anaesthetics
can
our
thoughts
embrace
the
mitigation
of
human
torment
which
the
application
of
chloroform
alone
has
caused
my
early
experiences
i
confess
made
me
singularly
conscious
at
an
age
when
one
should
know
nothing
about
these
things
of
that
torrent
of
sorrow
and
anguish
and
terror
which
flows
under
all
footsteps
of
man
within
my
childish
conscience
already
some
dim
inquiry
was
awake
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
mystery
of
pain
the
floods
of
the
tears
meet
and
gather
the
sound
of
them
all
grows
like
thunder
oh
into
what
bosom
i
wonder
is
poured
the
whole
sorrow
of
years
for
eternity
only
seems
keeping
account
of
the
great
human
weeping
may
god
then
the
maker
and
father
may
he
find
a
place
for
the
tears
in
my
mother
case
the
savage
treatment
did
no
good
it
had
to
be
abandoned
and
a
day
or
two
before
christmas
while
the
fruits
were
piled
in
the
and
the
butchers
were
shouting
outside
their
forests
of
carcases
my
father
brought
us
back
in
a
cab
through
the
streets
to
islington
a
feeble
and
languishing
company
our
invalid
bore
the
journey
fairly
well
enjoying
the
air
and
pointing
out
to
me
the
glittering
evidences
of
the
season
but
we
paid
heavily
for
her
little
entertainment
since
at
her
earnest
wish
the
window
of
the
cab
having
been
kept
open
she
caught
a
cold
which
became
indeed
the
technical
cause
of
a
death
that
no
applications
could
now
have
long
delayed
yet
she
lingered
with
us
six
weeks
more
and
during
this
time
i
again
relapsed
very
naturally
into
solitude
she
now
had
the
care
of
a
practised
woman
one
of
the
from
the
chapel
and
i
was
only
permitted
to
pay
brief
visits
to
her
bedside
that
i
might
not
be
kept
indoors
all
day
and
everyday
a
man
also
connected
with
the
was
paid
a
trifle
to
take
me
out
for
a
walk
each
morning
this
person
who
was
by
turns
familiar
and
truculent
was
the
object
of
my
intense
dislike
our
relations
became
in
the
truest
sense
i
was
obliged
to
walk
by
his
side
but
i
held
that
i
had
no
further
responsibility
to
be
agreeable
and
after
a
while
i
ceased
to
speak
to
him
or
to
answer
his
remarks
on
one
occasion
poor
dreary
man
he
met
a
friend
and
stopped
to
chat
with
him
i
considered
this
act
to
have
dissolved
the
bond
i
skipped
lightly
from
his
side
examined
several
which
i
had
been
forbidden
to
look
into
made
several
darts
down
courts
and
up
passages
and
finally
after
a
delightful
morning
returned
home
having
known
my
directions
perfectly
my
official
conductor
in
a
shocking
condition
of
fear
was
crouching
by
the
looking
up
and
down
the
street
he
darted
upon
me
in
a
great
rage
to
know
i
meant
by
it
i
drew
myself
up
as
tall
as
i
could
hissed
leader
of
the
blind
at
him
and
with
this
inappropriate
but
very
effective
parthian
shot
slipped
into
the
house
when
it
was
quite
certain
that
no
alleviations
and
no
medical
care
could
prevent
or
even
any
longer
postpone
the
departure
of
my
mother
i
believe
that
my
future
conduct
became
the
object
of
her
greatest
and
her
most
painful
solicitude
she
said
to
my
father
that
the
worst
trial
of
her
faith
came
from
the
feeling
that
she
was
called
upon
to
leave
that
child
whom
she
had
so
carefully
trained
from
his
earliest
infancy
for
the
peculiar
service
of
the
lord
without
any
knowledge
of
what
his
further
course
would
be
in
many
conversations
she
most
tenderly
and
closely
urged
my
father
who
however
needed
no
urging
to
watch
with
unceasing
care
over
my
spiritual
welfare
as
she
grew
nearer
her
end
it
was
observed
that
she
became
calmer
and
less
troubled
by
fears
about
me
the
intensity
of
her
prayers
and
hopes
seemed
to
have
a
prevailing
force
it
would
have
been
a
sin
to
doubt
that
such
supplications
such
confidence
and
devotion
such
an
emphasis
of
will
should
not
be
rewarded
by
an
answer
from
above
in
the
affirmative
she
was
able
she
said
to
leave
me
the
hands
of
her
loving
lord
or
on
another
occasion
the
care
of
her
covenant
god
although
her
faith
was
so
strong
and
simple
my
mother
possessed
no
quality
of
the
mystic
she
never
pretended
to
any
visionary
gifts
believed
not
at
all
in
dreams
or
portents
and
encouraged
nothing
in
herself
or
others
which
was
superstitious
or
fantastic
in
order
to
realize
her
condition
of
mind
it
is
necessary
i
think
to
accept
the
view
that
she
had
formed
a
definite
conception
of
the
absolute
unmodified
and
historical
veracity
in
its
direct
and
obvious
sense
of
every
statement
contained
within
the
covers
of
the
bible
for
her
and
for
my
father
nothing
was
symbolic
nothing
allegorical
or
allusive
in
any
part
of
scripture
except
what
was
in
so
many
words
proffered
as
a
parable
or
a
picture
pushing
this
to
its
extreme
limit
and
allowing
nothing
for
the
changes
of
scene
or
time
or
race
my
parents
read
injunctions
to
the
corinthian
converts
without
any
suspicion
that
what
was
apposite
in
dealing
with
achaian
colonists
of
the
first
century
might
not
exactly
apply
to
respectable
english
men
and
women
of
the
nineteenth
they
took
it
text
by
text
as
if
no
sort
of
difference
existed
between
the
surroundings
of
feast
and
those
of
a
city
dinner
both
my
parents
i
think
were
devoid
of
sympathetic
imagination
in
my
father
i
am
sure
it
was
singularly
absent
hence
although
their
faith
was
so
strenuous
that
many
persons
might
have
called
it
fanatical
there
was
no
mysticism
about
them
they
went
rather
to
the
opposite
extreme
to
the
cultivation
of
a
rigid
and
iconoclastic
literalness
this
was
curiously
exemplified
in
the
very
lively
interest
which
they
both
took
in
what
is
called
interpretation
of
prophecy
and
particularly
in
unwrapping
the
dark
sayings
bound
up
in
the
book
of
revelation
in
their
impartial
survey
of
the
bible
they
came
to
this
collection
of
solemn
and
splendid
visions
sinister
and
obscure
and
they
had
no
intention
of
allowing
these
to
be
merely
stimulating
to
the
fancy
or
vaguely
doctrinal
in
symbol
when
they
read
of
seals
broken
and
of
vials
poured
forth
of
the
star
which
was
called
wormwood
that
fell
from
heaven
and
of
men
whose
hair
was
as
the
hair
of
women
and
their
teeth
as
the
teeth
of
lions
they
did
not
admit
for
a
moment
that
these
vivid
mental
pictures
were
of
a
poetic
character
but
they
regarded
them
as
positive
statements
in
guarded
language
describing
events
which
were
to
happen
and
could
be
recognized
when
they
did
happen
it
was
the
explanation
the
perfectly
prosaic
and
positive
explanation
of
all
these
wonders
which
drew
them
to
study
the
habershons
and
the
newtons
whose
books
they
so
much
enjoyed
they
were
helped
by
these
guides
to
recognize
in
wild
oriental
visions
direct
statements
regarding
napoleon
iii
and
pope
pius
ix
and
the
king
of
piedmont
historic
figures
which
they
conceived
as
foreshadowed
in
language
which
admitted
of
plain
interpretation
under
the
names
of
denizens
of
babylon
and
companions
of
the
wild
beast
my
father
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
in
later
years
that
no
small
element
in
his
wedded
happiness
had
been
the
fact
that
my
mother
and
he
were
of
one
mind
in
the
interpretation
of
sacred
prophecy
looking
back
it
appears
to
me
that
this
unusual
mental
exercise
was
almost
their
only
relaxation
and
that
in
their
economy
it
took
the
place
which
is
taken
in
profaner
families
by
cards
or
the
piano
it
was
a
distraction
it
took
them
completely
out
of
themselves
during
those
melancholy
weeks
at
pimlico
i
read
aloud
another
work
of
the
same
nature
as
those
of
habershon
and
jukes
the
of
a
elliott
this
was
written
i
think
in
a
less
disagreeable
style
and
certainly
it
was
less
opaquely
obscure
to
me
my
recollection
distinctly
is
that
when
my
mother
could
endure
nothing
else
the
arguments
of
this
book
took
her
thoughts
away
from
her
pain
and
lifted
her
spirits
elliott
saw
queenly
arrogance
of
everywhere
and
believed
that
the
very
last
days
of
babylon
the
great
were
came
lest
i
say
what
may
be
thought
extravagant
let
me
quote
what
my
father
wrote
in
his
diary
at
the
time
of
my
mother
death
he
said
that
the
thought
that
rome
was
doomed
as
seemed
not
impossible
in
so
affected
my
mother
that
it
her
dying
hours
with
an
assurance
that
was
like
light
of
the
morning
star
the
harbinger
of
the
rising
sun
after
our
return
to
islington
there
was
a
complete
change
in
my
relation
to
my
mother
at
pimlico
i
had
been
her
only
companion
her
friend
her
confidant
but
now
that
she
was
at
home
again
people
and
things
combined
to
separate
me
from
her
now
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
no
longer
slept
in
her
room
no
longer
sank
to
sleep
under
her
kiss
no
longer
saw
her
mild
eyes
smile
on
me
with
the
earliest
sunshine
twice
a
day
after
breakfast
and
before
i
went
to
rest
i
was
brought
to
her
bedside
but
we
were
never
alone
other
people
sometimes
strange
people
were
there
we
had
no
cosy
talk
often
she
was
too
weak
to
do
more
than
pat
my
hand
her
loud
and
almost
constant
cough
terrified
and
harassed
me
i
felt
as
i
stood
awkwardly
and
shyly
by
her
high
bed
that
i
had
shrunken
into
a
very
small
and
insignificant
figure
that
she
was
floating
out
of
my
reach
that
all
things
but
i
knew
not
what
nor
how
were
corning
to
an
end
she
herself
was
not
herself
her
head
that
used
to
be
held
so
erect
now
rolled
or
sank
upon
the
pillow
the
sparkle
was
all
extinguished
from
those
bright
dear
eyes
i
could
not
understand
it
i
meditated
long
long
upon
it
all
in
my
infantile
darkness
in
the
garret
or
in
the
little
slip
of
a
cold
room
where
my
bed
was
now
placed
and
a
great
blind
anger
against
i
knew
not
what
awakened
in
my
soul
the
two
retreats
which
i
have
mentioned
were
now
all
that
were
left
to
me
in
the
someone
from
outside
gave
me
occasional
lessons
of
a
desultory
character
the
was
often
haunted
by
visitors
unknown
to
me
by
face
or
name
ladies
who
used
to
pity
me
and
even
to
pet
me
until
i
became
nimble
in
escaping
from
their
caresses
everything
seemed
to
be
unfixed
uncertain
it
was
like
being
on
the
platform
of
a
waiting
for
a
train
in
all
this
time
the
agitated
nervous
presence
of
my
father
whose
pale
face
was
permanently
drawn
with
anxiety
added
to
my
perturbation
and
i
became
miserable
stupid
as
if
i
had
lost
my
way
in
a
cold
fog
had
i
been
older
and
more
intelligent
of
course
it
might
have
been
of
him
and
not
of
myself
that
i
should
have
been
thinking
as
i
now
look
back
upon
that
tragic
time
it
is
for
him
that
my
heart
bleeds
for
them
both
so
singularly
fitted
as
they
were
to
support
and
cheer
one
another
in
an
existence
which
their
own
innate
and
cultivated
characteristics
had
made
little
hospitable
to
other
sources
of
comfort
this
is
not
to
be
dwelt
on
here
but
what
must
be
recorded
was
the
extraordinary
tranquillity
the
serene
and
sensible
resignation
with
which
at
length
my
parents
faced
the
awful
hour
language
can
not
utter
what
they
suffered
but
there
was
no
rebellion
no
repining
in
their
case
even
an
atheist
might
admit
that
the
overpowering
miracle
of
grace
was
mightily
efficient
it
seems
almost
cruel
to
the
memory
of
their
opinions
that
the
only
words
which
rise
to
my
mind
the
only
ones
which
seem
in
the
least
degree
adequate
to
describe
the
attitude
of
my
parents
had
fallen
from
the
pen
of
one
whom
in
their
want
of
imaginative
sympathy
they
had
regarded
as
anathema
but
john
henry
newman
might
have
come
from
the
contemplation
of
my
mother
when
he
wrote
the
trouble
which
the
world
inflicts
upon
us
and
which
flesh
can
not
but
feel
sorrow
pain
care
bereavement
these
avail
not
to
disturb
the
tranquillity
and
the
intensity
with
which
faith
gazes
at
the
divine
majesty
it
was
it
was
not
the
rapture
of
the
mystic
almost
in
the
last
hour
of
her
life
urged
to
confess
her
in
the
lord
my
mother
rigidly
honest
meticulous
in
as
ever
replied
have
peace
but
not
it
would
not
do
to
go
into
eternity
with
a
lie
in
my
mouth
when
the
very
end
approached
and
her
mind
was
growing
clouded
she
gathered
her
strength
together
to
say
to
my
father
shall
walk
with
him
in
white
wo
you
take
your
lamb
and
walk
with
me
confused
with
sorrow
and
alarm
my
father
failed
to
understand
her
meaning
she
became
agitated
and
she
repeated
two
or
three
times
our
lamb
and
walk
with
me
then
my
father
comprehended
and
pressed
me
forward
her
hand
fell
softly
upon
mine
and
she
seemed
content
thus
was
my
dedication
that
had
begun
in
my
cradle
sealed
with
the
most
solemn
the
most
poignant
and
irresistible
insistence
at
the
of
the
holiest
and
purest
of
women
but
what
a
weight
intolerable
as
the
burden
of
atlas
to
lay
on
the
shoulders
of
a
little
fragile
child
chapter
iv
certainly
the
preceding
year
the
seventh
of
my
life
had
been
weighted
for
us
with
comprehensive
disaster
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
that
at
the
beginning
of
my
mother
fatal
illness
misfortune
came
upon
her
brothers
i
have
never
known
the
particulars
of
their
ruin
but
i
believe
in
consequence
of
a
unsuccessful
speculations
and
of
the
fact
that
had
allowed
the
use
of
his
name
as
a
surety
both
my
uncles
were
obliged
to
fly
from
their
creditors
and
take
refuge
in
paris
this
happened
just
when
our
need
was
the
sorest
and
this
together
with
the
poignancy
of
knowing
that
their
sister
devoted
labours
for
them
had
been
all
in
vain
added
to
their
unhappiness
it
was
doubtless
also
the
reason
why
having
left
england
they
wrote
to
us
no
more
carefully
concealing
from
us
even
their
address
so
that
when
my
mother
died
my
father
was
unable
to
communicate
with
them
i
fear
that
they
fell
into
dire
distress
before
very
long
we
learned
that
had
died
but
it
was
fifteen
years
more
before
we
heard
anything
of
whose
life
had
at
length
been
preserved
by
the
kindness
of
an
old
servant
but
whose
mind
was
now
so
clouded
that
he
could
recollect
little
or
nothing
of
the
past
and
soon
he
also
died
amiable
gentle
without
any
species
of
practical
ability
they
were
quite
unfitted
to
struggle
with
the
world
which
had
touched
them
only
to
wreck
them
the
flight
of
my
uncles
at
this
particular
juncture
left
me
without
a
relative
on
my
mother
side
at
the
time
of
her
death
this
isolation
threw
my
father
into
a
sad
perplexity
his
only
obvious
source
of
income
but
it
happened
to
be
a
remarkably
hopeful
one
was
an
engagement
to
deliver
a
long
series
of
lectures
on
marine
natural
history
throughout
the
north
and
centre
of
england
these
lectures
were
an
entire
novelty
nothing
like
them
had
been
offered
to
the
provincial
public
before
and
the
fact
that
the
marine
aquarium
was
the
fashionable
toy
of
the
moment
added
to
their
attraction
my
father
was
bowed
down
by
sorrow
and
care
but
he
was
not
broken
his
intellectual
forces
were
at
their
height
and
so
was
his
popularity
as
an
author
the
lectures
were
to
begin
in
march
my
mother
was
buried
on
february
it
seemed
at
first
in
the
inertia
of
bereavement
to
be
all
beyond
his
powers
to
make
the
supreme
effort
but
the
wholesome
prick
of
need
urged
him
on
it
was
a
question
of
paying
for
food
and
clothes
of
keeping
a
roof
above
our
heads
the
captain
of
a
vessel
in
a
storm
must
navigate
his
ship
although
his
wife
lies
dead
in
the
cabin
that
was
my
father
position
in
the
spring
of
he
had
to
stimulate
instruct
amuse
large
audiences
of
strangers
and
seem
gay
although
affliction
and
loneliness
had
settled
in
his
heart
he
had
to
do
this
or
starve
but
the
difficulty
still
remained
during
these
months
what
was
to
become
of
me
my
father
could
not
take
me
with
him
from
hotel
to
hotel
and
from
to
nor
could
he
leave
me
as
people
leave
the
domestic
cat
in
an
empty
house
for
the
neighbours
to
feed
at
intervals
the
dilemma
threatened
to
be
insurmountable
when
suddenly
there
descended
upon
us
a
kind
but
paternal
cousin
from
the
west
of
england
who
had
heard
of
our
calamities
this
lady
had
a
large
family
of
her
own
at
bristol
she
offered
to
find
room
in
it
for
me
so
long
as
ever
my
father
should
be
away
in
the
north
and
when
my
father
bewildered
by
so
much
goodness
hesitated
she
came
up
to
london
and
carried
me
forcibly
away
in
a
whirlwind
of
her
benevolence
was
quite
spontaneous
and
i
am
not
sure
that
she
had
not
added
to
it
already
by
helping
to
nurse
our
beloved
sufferer
through
part
of
her
illness
of
that
i
am
not
positive
but
i
recollect
very
clearly
her
snatching
me
from
our
cold
and
desolate
hearthstone
and
carrying
me
off
to
her
cheerful
house
at
clifton
here
for
the
first
time
when
half
through
my
eighth
year
i
was
thrown
into
the
society
of
young
people
my
cousins
were
none
of
them
i
believe
any
longer
children
but
they
were
youths
and
maidens
busily
engaged
in
various
personal
interests
all
collected
in
a
hive
of
wholesome
family
energy
everybody
was
very
kind
to
me
and
i
sank
back
after
the
strain
of
so
many
months
into
mere
childhood
again
this
long
visit
to
my
cousins
at
clifton
must
have
been
very
delightful
i
am
dimly
aware
that
it
was
yet
i
remember
but
few
of
its
incidents
my
memory
so
clear
and
vivid
about
earlier
solitary
times
now
in
all
this
society
becomes
blurred
and
vague
i
recollect
certain
pleasures
being
taken
for
instance
to
a
menagerie
and
having
a
practical
joke
in
the
worst
taste
played
upon
me
by
the
pelican
one
of
my
cousins
who
was
a
medical
student
showed
me
a
pistol
and
helped
me
to
fire
it
he
smoked
a
pipe
and
i
was
oddly
conscious
that
both
the
firearm
and
the
tobacco
were
definitely
hostile
to
my
my
took
turns
in
putting
me
to
bed
and
on
cold
nights
or
when
they
were
in
a
hurry
allowed
me
to
say
my
prayer
under
the
instead
of
kneeling
at
a
chair
the
result
of
this
was
further
spiritual
laxity
because
i
could
not
help
going
to
sleep
before
the
prayer
was
ended
the
visit
to
clifton
was
in
fact
a
blessed
interval
in
my
strenuous
childhood
it
probably
prevented
my
nerves
from
breaking
down
under
the
pressure
of
the
previous
months
the
clifton
family
was
in
a
quiet
sensible
way
but
there
was
a
total
absence
of
all
the
intensity
and
compulsion
of
our
religious
life
at
islington
i
was
not
encouraged
i
even
remember
that
i
was
gently
snubbed
when
i
rattled
forth
fashion
the
conventional
phraseology
of
saints
for
a
short
enchanting
period
of
respite
i
lived
the
life
of
an
ordinary
little
boy
relapsing
to
a
degree
which
would
have
filled
my
father
with
despair
into
childish
thoughts
and
childish
language
the
result
was
that
of
this
little
happy
i
have
nothing
to
report
vague
remembrances
of
walks
with
my
tall
cousins
waving
like
trees
above
me
pleasant
noisy
evenings
in
a
great
room
on
the
floor
faint
of
excursions
into
the
country
all
this
is
the
very
pale
and
shadowy
testimony
to
a
brief
interval
of
healthy
happy
when
my
soul
was
allowed
to
have
for
a
little
while
no
history
the
life
of
a
child
is
so
brief
its
impressions
are
so
illusory
and
fugitive
that
it
is
as
difficult
to
record
its
history
as
it
would
be
to
design
a
morning
cloud
sailing
before
the
wind
it
is
short
as
we
count
shortness
in
after
years
when
the
drag
of
lead
pulls
down
to
earth
the
foot
that
used
to
flutter
with
a
winged
impetuosity
and
to
float
with
the
pulse
of
hermes
but
in
memory
my
childhood
was
long
long
with
interminable
hours
hours
with
the
pale
cheek
pressed
against
the
windowpane
hours
of
mechanical
and
repeated
lonely
which
had
lost
their
savour
and
were
kept
going
by
sheer
inertness
not
unhappy
not
fretful
but
long
long
long
it
seems
to
me
as
i
look
back
to
the
life
in
the
motherless
islington
house
as
i
resumed
it
in
that
slow
eighth
year
of
my
life
that
time
had
ceased
to
move
there
was
a
whole
age
between
one
tick
of
the
clock
in
the
hall
and
the
next
tick
when
the
milkman
went
his
rounds
in
our
grey
street
with
his
eldritch
scream
over
the
top
of
each
set
of
area
railings
it
seemed
as
though
he
would
never
disappear
again
there
was
no
past
and
no
future
for
me
and
the
present
felt
as
though
it
were
sealed
up
in
a
leyden
jar
even
my
dreams
were
interminable
and
hung
stationary
from
the
nightly
sky
at
this
time
the
street
was
my
theatre
and
i
spent
long
periods
as
i
have
said
leaning
against
the
window
i
feel
now
that
coldness
of
the
pane
and
the
feverish
heat
that
was
produced
by
contrast
in
the
orbit
round
the
eye
now
and
then
amusing
things
happened
the
was
a
joy
long
waited
for
this
worthy
was
a
tall
and
bony
jersey
protestant
with
a
raucous
voice
who
strode
up
our
street
several
times
a
week
carrying
a
yoke
across
his
shoulders
from
the
ends
of
which
hung
ropes
of
onions
he
used
to
shout
at
abrupt
intervals
in
a
tone
which
might
wake
the
dead
here
your
rope
to
hang
the
pope
and
a
of
cheese
to
choke
him
the
cheese
appeared
to
be
legendary
he
sold
only
onions
my
father
did
not
eat
onions
but
he
encouraged
this
terrible
fellow
with
his
wild
eyes
and
long
strips
of
hair
because
of
his
godly
attitude
towards
the
and
i
used
to
watch
him
dart
out
of
the
front
door
present
his
penny
and
retire
graciously
waving
back
the
proffered
onion
on
the
other
hand
my
father
did
not
approve
of
a
fat
sailor
who
was
a
constant
this
man
who
was
probably
crazed
used
to
wall
very
slowly
up
the
centre
of
our
street
vociferating
with
the
voice
of
a
bull
and
night
and
this
melancholy
admonition
was
the
entire
business
of
his
life
he
did
nothing
at
all
but
walk
up
and
down
the
streets
of
islington
exhorting
the
inhabitants
to
watch
and
pray
i
do
not
recollect
that
this
stopped
to
collect
pennies
and
my
impression
is
that
he
was
after
his
fashion
a
volunteer
evangelist
the
tragedy
of
punch
was
another
and
a
still
greater
delight
i
was
never
allowed
to
go
out
into
the
street
to
mingle
with
the
little
crowd
which
gathered
under
the
stage
and
as
i
was
extremely
the
impression
i
received
was
vague
but
when
by
happy
chance
the
show
stopped
opposite
our
door
i
saw
enough
of
that
ancient
drama
to
be
thrilled
with
terror
and
delight
i
was
much
affected
by
the
internal
troubles
of
the
punch
family
i
thought
that
with
a
little
more
tact
on
the
part
of
punch
and
some
restraint
held
over
a
temper
naturally
violent
by
punch
a
great
deal
of
this
sad
misunderstanding
might
have
been
prevented
the
momentous
close
when
a
figure
of
shapeless
horror
appears
on
the
stage
and
quells
the
hitherto
undaunted
punch
was
to
me
the
bouquet
of
the
entire
performance
when
punch
losing
his
nerve
points
to
this
shape
and
says
in
an
awestruck
squeaking
whisper
that
is
it
the
butcher
and
the
stern
answer
comes
mr
punch
and
then
it
the
baker
mr
punch
is
it
then
this
in
a
squeak
trembling
with
emotion
and
terror
and
then
the
full
loud
reply
booming
like
a
is
the
devil
come
to
take
you
down
to
hell
and
the
form
of
punch
with
kicking
legs
sunken
in
epilepsy
on
the
floor
all
this
was
solemn
and
exquisite
to
me
beyond
words
i
was
not
amused
i
was
deeply
moved
and
exhilarated
as
the
old
phrase
hath
it
pity
and
terror
another
joy
in
a
lighter
key
was
watching
a
fantastic
old
man
who
came
slowly
up
the
street
hung
about
with
drums
and
flutes
and
kites
and
coloured
balls
and
bearing
over
his
shoulders
a
great
sack
children
and
used
to
bolt
up
out
of
areas
and
chaffer
with
this
gaudy
person
who
would
presently
trudge
on
always
repeating
the
same
set
of
words
here
your
toys
for
girls
and
boys
for
bits
of
brass
and
broken
glass
these
four
lines
being
spoken
in
a
breathless
hurry
a
penny
or
a
this
being
drawled
out
in
an
endless
wail
i
was
not
permitted
to
go
forth
and
trade
with
this
old
person
but
sometimes
our
did
thereby
making
me
feel
that
if
i
did
not
hold
the
rose
of
merchandise
i
was
very
near
it
my
experiences
with
my
cousins
at
clifton
had
given
me
the
habit
of
looking
out
into
the
world
even
though
it
was
only
into
the
pale
world
of
our
quiet
street
my
father
and
i
were
now
great
friends
i
do
not
doubt
that
he
felt
his
responsibility
to
fill
as
far
as
might
be
the
gap
which
the
death
of
my
mother
had
made
in
my
existence
i
spent
a
large
portion
of
my
time
in
his
study
while
he
was
writing
or
drawing
and
though
very
little
conversation
passed
between
us
i
think
that
each
enjoyed
the
companionship
of
the
other
there
were
two
and
sometimes
three
aquaria
in
the
room
tanks
of
with
glass
sides
inside
which
all
sorts
of
creatures
crawled
and
swam
these
were
sources
of
endless
pleasure
to
me
and
at
this
time
began
to
be
laid
upon
me
the
occasional
task
of
watching
and
afterwards
reporting
the
habits
of
animals
at
other
times
i
dragged
a
folio
volume
of
the
up
to
the
study
with
me
and
sat
there
reading
successive
articles
on
such
subjects
as
parrots
parthians
passover
and
pastry
without
any
invidious
preferences
all
information
being
equally
welcome
and
equally
fugitive
that
something
of
all
this
loose
stream
of
knowledge
clung
to
odd
cells
of
the
back
of
my
brain
seems
to
be
shown
by
the
fact
that
to
this
day
i
occasionally
find
myself
aware
of
some
stray
useless
fact
about
peonies
or
pemmican
or
pepper
which
i
can
only
trace
back
to
the
of
my
infancy
it
will
be
asked
what
the
attitude
of
my
father
mind
was
to
me
and
of
mine
to
his
as
regards
religion
at
this
time
when
we
were
thrown
together
alone
so
much
it
is
difficult
to
reply
with
exactitude
but
so
far
as
the
former
is
concerned
i
thinly
that
the
extreme
violence
of
the
spiritual
emotions
to
which
my
father
had
been
subjected
had
now
been
followed
by
a
certain
reaction
he
had
not
changed
his
views
in
any
respect
and
he
was
prepared
to
work
out
the
results
of
them
with
greater
zeal
than
ever
but
just
at
present
his
religious
nature
like
his
physical
nature
was
tired
out
with
anxiety
and
sorrow
he
accepted
the
supposition
that
i
was
entirely
with
him
in
all
respects
so
far
that
is
to
say
as
a
being
so
rudimentary
and
feeble
as
a
little
child
could
be
my
mother
in
her
last
hours
had
dwelt
on
our
unity
in
god
we
were
drawn
together
she
said
elect
from
the
world
in
a
triplicity
of
faith
and
joy
she
had
constantly
repeated
the
words
shall
be
one
family
one
song
one
song
one
family
my
father
i
think
accepted
this
as
a
prophecy
he
felt
no
doubt
of
our
triple
unity
my
mother
had
now
merely
passed
before
us
through
a
door
into
a
world
of
light
where
we
should
presently
join
her
where
all
things
would
be
radiant
and
blissful
but
where
we
three
would
in
some
unknown
way
be
particularly
drawn
together
in
a
tie
of
inexpressible
beatitude
he
fretted
at
the
delay
he
would
have
taken
me
by
the
hand
and
have
joined
her
in
the
realms
of
holiness
and
light
at
once
without
this
dreary
dalliance
with
earthly
cares
he
held
this
confidence
and
vision
steadily
before
him
but
nothing
availed
against
the
melancholy
of
his
natural
state
he
was
conscious
of
his
dull
and
solitary
condition
and
he
saw
too
that
it
enveloped
me
i
think
his
heart
was
at
this
time
drawn
out
towards
me
in
an
immense
tenderness
sometimes
when
the
early
twilight
descended
upon
us
in
the
study
and
he
could
no
longer
peer
with
advantage
into
the
depths
of
his
microscope
he
would
beckon
me
to
him
silently
and
fold
me
closely
in
his
arms
i
used
to
turn
my
face
up
to
his
patiently
and
wonderingly
while
the
large
unwilling
tears
gathered
in
the
corners
of
his
eyelids
my
training
had
given
me
a
preternatural
faculty
of
stillness
and
we
would
stay
so
without
a
word
or
a
movement
until
the
darkness
filled
the
room
and
then
with
my
little
hand
in
his
we
would
walk
sedately
downstairs
to
the
parlour
where
we
would
find
that
the
lamp
was
lighted
and
that
our
melancholy
vigil
was
ended
i
do
not
think
that
at
any
part
of
our
lives
my
father
and
i
were
drawn
so
close
to
one
another
as
we
were
in
that
summer
of
yet
we
seldom
spoke
of
what
lay
so
warm
and
fragrant
between
us
the
thought
of
our
departed
the
visit
to
my
cousins
had
made
one
considerable
change
in
me
under
the
old
solitary
discipline
my
intelligence
had
grown
at
the
expense
of
my
sentiment
i
was
innocent
but
inhuman
the
long
suffering
and
the
death
of
my
mother
had
awakened
my
heart
had
taught
me
what
pain
was
but
had
left
me
savage
and
morose
i
had
still
no
idea
of
the
relations
of
human
beings
to
one
another
i
had
learned
no
word
of
that
philosophy
which
comes
to
the
children
of
the
poor
in
the
struggle
of
the
street
and
to
the
children
of
the
in
the
clash
of
the
nursery
in
other
words
i
had
no
humanity
i
had
been
carefully
shielded
from
the
chance
of
it
as
though
it
were
the
most
dangerous
of
microbes
but
now
that
i
had
enjoyed
a
little
of
the
common
experience
of
childhood
a
great
change
had
come
upon
me
before
i
went
to
clifton
my
mental
life
was
all
interior
a
rack
of
baseless
dream
upon
dream
but
now
i
was
eager
to
look
out
of
the
window
to
go
out
in
the
streets
i
was
taken
with
a
curiosity
about
human
life
even
from
my
vantage
of
the
pane
i
watched
boys
and
girls
go
by
with
an
interest
which
began
to
be
almost
wistful
still
i
continued
to
have
no
young
companions
but
on
summer
evenings
i
used
to
drag
my
father
out
taking
the
initiative
myself
stamping
in
playful
impatience
at
his
irresolution
fetching
his
hat
and
stick
and
waiting
we
used
to
sally
forth
at
last
together
hand
in
hand
descending
the
caledonian
road
with
all
its
shops
as
far
as
mother
shipton
or
else
winding
among
the
squares
and
terraces
westward
by
copenhagen
street
or
best
of
all
mounting
to
the
canal
where
we
paused
to
lean
over
the
bridge
and
watch
flotillas
of
ducks
steer
under
us
or
little
white
dogs
dash
impotently
furious
from
stem
to
stern
of
the
great
lazy
barges
painted
in
a
crude
vehemence
of
vermilion
and
azure
these
were
happy
hours
when
the
spectre
of
religion
ceased
to
overshadow
us
for
a
little
while
when
my
father
forgot
the
apocalypse
and
dropped
his
austere
phraseology
and
when
our
bass
and
treble
voices
used
to
ring
out
together
over
some
foolish
little
jest
or
some
mirthful
recollection
of
his
past
experiences
little
soft
oases
these
in
the
hard
desert
of
our
sandy
spiritual
life
at
home
there
was
an
unbending
too
when
we
used
to
sing
together
in
my
case
very
tunelessly
i
had
inherited
a
plentiful
lack
of
musical
genius
from
my
mother
who
had
neither
ear
nor
voice
and
who
had
said
in
the
course
of
her
last
illness
shall
sing
his
praise
in
strains
i
never
could
master
here
below
my
father
on
the
other
hand
had
some
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
vocal
music
although
not
i
am
afraid
much
taste
he
had
at
least
great
fondness
for
singing
hymns
in
the
manner
then
popular
with
the
evangelicals
very
loudly
and
so
slowly
that
i
used
to
count
how
many
words
i
could
read
silently
between
one
syllable
of
the
singing
and
another
my
lack
of
skill
did
not
prevent
me
from
being
zealous
at
these
vocal
exercises
and
my
father
and
i
used
to
sing
lustily
together
the
wesleys
charlotte
elliott
as
i
am
without
one
plea
and
james
montgomery
with
the
lord
represented
his
predilection
in
hymnology
i
acquiesced
although
that
would
not
have
been
my
independent
choice
these
represented
the
devotional
verse
which
made
its
direct
appeal
to
the
evangelical
mind
and
served
in
those
days
to
counteract
the
high
church
poetry
founded
on
christian
year
of
that
famous
volume
i
never
met
with
a
copy
until
i
was
grown
up
and
equally
unknown
in
our
circle
were
the
hymns
of
newman
faber
and
neale
it
was
my
father
plan
from
the
first
to
keep
me
entirely
ignorant
of
the
poetry
of
the
high
church
which
deeply
offended
his
calvinism
he
thought
that
religious
truth
could
be
sucked
in
like
mother
milk
from
hymns
which
were
godly
and
sound
and
yet
correctly
versified
and
i
was
therefore
carefully
trained
in
this
direction
from
an
early
date
but
my
spirit
had
rebelled
against
some
of
these
hymns
especially
against
those
written
a
mighty
multitude
by
horatius
bonar
naughtily
refusing
to
read
bonar
heard
the
voice
of
jesus
say
to
my
mother
in
our
pimlico
lodgings
a
secret
hostility
to
this
particular
form
of
effusion
was
already
at
the
age
of
seven
beginning
to
define
itself
in
my
brain
side
by
side
with
an
unctuous
infantile
conformity
i
find
a
difficulty
in
recalling
the
precise
nature
of
the
religious
instruction
which
my
father
gave
me
at
this
time
it
was
incessant
and
it
was
founded
on
the
close
inspection
of
the
bible
particularly
of
the
epistles
of
the
new
testament
this
summer
as
my
eighth
year
advanced
we
read
the
to
the
hebrews
with
very
great
deliberation
stopping
every
moment
that
my
father
might
expound
it
verse
by
verse
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
language
for
instance
the
matchless
cadences
and
images
of
the
first
chapter
made
a
certain
impression
upon
my
imagination
and
were
i
think
my
earliest
initiation
into
the
magic
of
literature
i
was
incapable
of
defining
what
i
felt
but
i
certainly
had
a
grip
in
the
throat
which
was
in
its
essence
a
purely
aesthetic
emotion
when
my
father
read
in
his
pure
large
ringing
voice
such
passages
as
heavens
are
the
works
of
thy
hands
they
shall
perish
but
thou
remainest
and
they
all
shall
wax
old
as
doth
a
garment
and
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
fold
them
up
and
they
shall
be
changed
but
thou
art
the
same
and
thy
years
shall
not
fail
but
the
dialectic
parts
of
the
epistle
puzzled
and
confused
me
such
metaphysical
ideas
as
again
the
foundation
of
repentance
from
dead
works
and
the
son
of
god
afresh
were
not
successfully
brought
down
to
the
level
of
my
understanding
my
father
religious
teaching
to
me
was
almost
exclusively
doctrinal
he
did
not
observe
the
value
of
negative
education
that
is
to
say
of
leaving
nature
alone
to
fill
up
the
gaps
which
it
is
her
design
to
deal
with
at
a
later
and
riper
date
he
did
not
even
satisfy
himself
with
those
moral
injunctions
which
should
form
the
basis
of
infantile
discipline
he
was
in
a
tremendous
hurry
to
push
on
my
spiritual
growth
and
he
fed
me
with
theological
meat
which
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
digest
some
glimmer
of
a
suspicion
that
he
was
sailing
on
the
wrong
tack
must
i
should
suppose
have
broken
in
upon
him
when
we
had
reached
the
eighth
and
ninth
chapters
of
hebrews
where
addressing
readers
who
had
been
brought
up
under
the
jewish
dispensation
and
had
the
formalities
of
the
law
of
moses
in
their
very
blood
the
apostle
battles
with
their
dangerous
conservatism
it
is
a
very
noble
piece
of
spiritual
casuistry
but
it
is
signally
unfitted
for
the
comprehension
of
a
child
suddenly
by
my
flushing
up
with
anger
and
saying
how
i
do
hate
that
law
my
father
perceived
and
paused
in
amazement
to
perceive
that
i
took
the
law
to
be
a
person
of
malignant
temper
from
whose
cruel
bondage
and
from
whose
intolerable
tyranny
and
unfairness
some
excellent
person
was
crying
out
to
be
delivered
i
wished
to
hit
law
with
my
fist
for
being
so
mean
and
unreasonable
upon
this
of
course
it
was
necessary
to
reopen
the
whole
line
of
exposition
my
father
without
realizing
it
had
been
talking
on
his
own
level
not
on
mine
and
now
he
condescended
to
me
but
without
very
great
success
the
melodious
language
the
divine
forensic
audacities
the
magnificent
ebb
and
flow
of
argument
which
make
the
to
the
hebrews
such
a
miracle
were
far
and
away
beyond
my
reach
and
they
only
bewildered
me
some
evangelical
children
of
my
generation
i
understand
were
brought
up
on
a
work
called
upon
line
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
my
father
ambition
would
not
submit
to
anything
suggested
by
such
a
title
as
that
and
he
committed
from
his
own
point
of
view
a
fatal
mistake
when
he
sought
to
build
spires
and
battlements
without
having
been
at
the
pains
to
settle
a
foundation
beneath
them
we
were
not
always
reading
the
to
the
hebrews
however
not
always
was
my
flesh
being
made
to
creep
by
having
it
insisted
upon
that
all
things
are
by
the
law
purged
with
blood
and
without
blood
is
no
remission
of
sin
in
our
lighter
moods
we
turned
to
the
of
revelation
and
chased
the
phantom
of
popery
through
its
fuliginous
pages
my
father
i
think
missed
my
mother
company
almost
more
acutely
in
his
researches
into
prophecy
than
in
anything
else
this
had
been
their
unceasing
recreation
and
no
third
person
could
possibly
follow
the
curious
path
which
they
had
hewn
for
themselves
through
this
jungle
of
symbols
but
more
and
more
my
father
persuaded
himself
that
i
too
was
initiated
and
by
degrees
i
was
made
to
share
in
all
his
speculations
and
interpretations
hand
in
hand
we
investigated
the
number
of
the
beast
which
number
is
six
hundred
three
score
and
six
hand
in
hand
we
inspected
the
nations
to
see
whether
they
had
the
mark
of
babylon
in
their
foreheads
hand
in
hand
we
watched
the
spirits
of
devils
gathering
the
kings
of
the
earth
into
the
place
which
is
called
in
the
hebrew
tongue
armageddon
our
unity
in
these
excursions
was
so
delightful
that
my
father
was
lulled
in
any
suspicion
he
might
have
formed
that
i
did
not
quite
understand
what
it
was
all
about
nor
could
he
have
desired
a
pupil
more
docile
or
more
ardent
than
i
was
in
my
flaming
denunciations
of
the
papacy
if
there
was
one
institution
more
than
another
which
at
this
early
stage
of
my
history
i
loathed
and
feared
it
was
what
we
invariably
spoke
of
as
church
of
rome
in
later
years
i
have
met
with
stout
protestants
gallant
pope
men
from
county
antrim
and
ladies
who
see
the
hand
of
the
jesuits
in
every
public
and
private
misfortune
it
is
the
habit
of
a
loose
and
indifferent
age
to
consider
this
dwindling
body
of
enthusiasts
with
suspicion
and
to
regard
their
attitude
towards
rome
as
illiberal
but
my
own
feeling
is
that
they
are
all
too
mild
that
their
denunciations
err
on
the
side
of
the
anodyne
i
have
no
longer
the
slightest
wish
myself
to
denounce
the
roman
communion
but
if
it
is
to
be
done
i
have
an
idea
that
the
protestants
do
not
know
how
to
do
it
in
lord
chesterfield
phrase
these
men
understand
their
own
silly
business
they
make
concessions
and
allowances
they
put
on
gloves
to
touch
the
accursed
thing
not
thus
did
we
approach
the
scarlet
woman
in
the
we
palliated
nothing
we
believed
in
no
good
intentions
we
used
i
myself
used
in
my
tender
innocency
language
of
the
seventeenth
century
such
as
is
now
no
longer
introduced
into
any
species
of
controversy
as
a
little
boy
when
i
thought
with
intense
vagueness
of
the
pope
i
used
to
shut
my
eyes
tight
and
clench
my
fists
we
welcomed
any
social
disorder
in
any
part
of
italy
as
likely
to
be
annoying
to
the
papacy
if
there
was
a
house
officer
stabbed
in
a
fracas
at
sassari
we
gave
loud
thanks
that
liberty
and
light
were
breaking
in
upon
sardinia
if
there
was
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
murder
the
grand
duke
we
lifted
up
our
voices
to
celebrate
the
faith
and
sufferings
of
the
dear
persecuted
tuscans
and
the
record
of
some
apocryphal
monstrosity
in
naples
would
only
reveal
to
us
a
glorious
opening
for
gospel
energy
my
father
celebrated
the
announcement
in
the
newspapers
of
a
considerable
emigration
from
the
papal
dominions
by
rejoicing
at
outcrowding
of
many
throughout
the
domain
from
her
sins
and
her
plagues
no
the
protestant
league
may
consider
itself
to
be
an
earnest
and
active
body
but
i
can
never
look
upon
its
efforts
as
anything
but
lukewarm
standing
as
i
do
with
the
light
of
other
days
around
me
as
a
child
whatever
i
might
question
i
never
doubted
the
turpitude
of
rome
i
do
not
think
i
had
formed
any
idea
whatever
of
the
character
or
pretensions
or
practices
of
the
catholic
church
or
indeed
of
what
it
consisted
or
its
nature
but
i
regarded
it
with
a
vague
terror
as
a
wild
beast
the
only
good
point
about
it
being
that
it
was
very
old
and
was
soon
to
die
when
i
turned
to
jukes
or
newton
for
further
detail
i
could
not
understand
what
they
said
perhaps
on
the
whole
there
was
no
disadvantage
in
that
it
is
possible
that
someone
may
have
observed
to
my
father
that
the
conditions
of
our
life
were
unfavourable
to
our
health
although
i
hardly
think
that
he
would
have
encouraged
any
such
advice
as
i
look
back
upon
this
time
i
am
surprised
at
the
absence
in
it
of
any
figures
but
our
own
he
and
i
together
now
in
the
study
among
the
and
starfishes
now
on
the
looking
down
at
the
ducks
now
at
our
hard
little
meals
served
up
as
those
of
a
dreamy
widower
are
likely
to
be
when
one
provides
them
now
under
the
lamp
at
the
maps
we
both
loved
so
much
this
is
what
i
see
no
third
presence
is
ever
with
us
whether
it
occurred
to
himself
that
such
a
solitude
was
excellent
in
the
long
run
for
neither
of
us
or
whether
any
chance
visitor
or
one
of
the
who
used
to
see
me
at
the
room
every
sunday
morning
suggested
that
a
female
influence
might
put
a
little
into
my
pasty
cheeks
i
know
not
all
i
am
sure
of
is
that
one
day
towards
the
close
of
the
summer
as
i
was
gazing
into
the
street
i
saw
a
cab
stop
outside
our
door
and
deposit
with
several
packages
a
strange
lady
who
was
shown
up
into
my
father
study
and
was
presently
brought
down
and
introduced
to
me
miss
marks
as
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
calling
this
person
was
so
long
a
part
of
my
life
that
i
must
pause
to
describe
her
she
was
tall
rather
gaunt
with
high
her
teeth
were
prominent
and
very
white
her
eyes
were
and
were
always
absolutely
fixed
wide
open
on
the
person
she
spoke
to
her
nose
was
inclined
to
be
red
at
the
tip
she
had
a
kind
hearty
sharp
mode
of
talking
but
did
not
exercise
it
much
being
on
the
whole
taciturn
she
was
bustling
and
nervous
not
particularly
refined
not
quite
i
imagine
what
is
called
lady
i
supposed
her
if
i
thought
of
the
matter
at
all
to
be
very
old
but
perhaps
she
may
have
been
when
we
knew
her
first
some
summers
miss
marks
was
an
orphan
depending
upon
her
work
for
her
living
she
would
not
in
these
days
of
examinations
have
come
up
to
the
necessary
educational
standards
but
she
had
enjoyed
experience
in
teaching
and
was
prepared
to
be
a
conscientious
and
careful
governess
up
to
her
lights
i
was
now
informed
by
my
father
that
it
was
in
this
capacity
that
she
would
in
future
take
her
place
in
our
household
i
was
not
informed
what
i
gradually
learned
by
observation
that
she
would
also
act
in
it
as
housekeeper
miss
marks
was
a
somewhat
grotesque
personage
and
might
easily
be
painted
as
a
kind
of
eccentric
dickens
character
a
mixture
of
pipchin
and
miss
sally
brass
i
will
confess
that
when
in
years
to
come
i
read
and
son
certain
features
of
pipchin
did
irresistibly
remind
me
of
my
excellent
past
governess
i
can
imagine
miss
marks
saying
but
with
a
facetious
intent
that
children
who
sniffed
would
not
go
to
heaven
but
i
was
instantly
ashamed
of
the
parallel
because
my
gaunt
old
friend
was
a
thoroughly
good
and
honest
woman
not
intelligent
and
not
graceful
but
desirous
in
every
way
to
do
her
duty
her
duty
to
me
she
certainly
did
and
i
am
afraid
i
hardly
rewarded
her
with
the
devotion
she
deserved
from
the
first
i
was
indifferent
to
her
wishes
and
as
much
as
was
convenient
i
ignored
her
existence
she
held
no
power
over
my
attention
and
if
i
accepted
her
guidance
along
the
path
of
instruction
it
was
because
odd
as
it
may
sound
i
really
loved
knowledge
i
accepted
her
company
without
objection
and
though
there
were
occasional
outbreaks
of
tantrums
on
both
sides
we
got
on
very
well
together
for
several
years
i
did
not
however
at
any
time
surrender
my
inward
will
to
the
wishes
of
miss
marks
in
the
circle
of
our
life
the
religious
element
took
so
preponderating
a
place
that
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
mentioning
what
might
otherwise
seem
unimportant
the
theological
views
of
miss
marks
how
my
father
had
discovered
her
or
from
what
field
of
educational
enterprise
he
plucked
her
in
her
prime
i
never
knew
but
she
used
to
mention
that
my
father
ministrations
had
her
eyes
from
which
had
fallen
she
had
accepted
on
their
presentation
to
her
the
entire
gamut
of
his
principles
miss
marks
was
accustomed
while
putting
me
to
bed
to
dwell
darkly
on
the
incidents
of
her
past
which
had
i
fear
been
an
afflicted
one
i
believe
i
do
her
rather
limited
intelligence
no
injury
when
i
say
that
it
was
prepared
to
swallow
at
one
mouthful
whatever
my
father
presented
to
it
so
delighted
was
its
possessor
to
find
herself
in
a
comfortable
or
at
least
an
independent
position
she
soon
bowed
if
there
was
indeed
any
resistance
from
the
first
very
contentedly
in
the
house
of
rimmon
learning
to
repeat
with
marked
fluency
the
customary
formulas
and
shibboleths
on
my
own
religious
development
she
had
no
great
influence
any
such
guttering
theological
rushlight
as
miss
marks
might
dutifully
exhibit
faded
for
me
in
the
blaze
of
my
glaring
of
faith
hardly
was
miss
marks
settled
in
the
family
than
my
father
left
us
on
an
expedition
about
which
my
curiosity
was
exercised
but
not
until
later
satisfied
he
had
gone
as
we
afterwards
found
to
south
devon
to
a
point
on
the
coast
which
he
had
known
of
old
here
he
had
hired
a
horse
and
had
ridden
about
until
he
saw
a
spot
he
liked
where
a
villa
was
being
built
on
speculation
nothing
equals
the
courage
of
these
recluse
men
my
father
got
off
his
horse
and
tied
it
to
the
gate
and
then
he
went
in
and
bought
the
house
on
a
years
lease
i
need
hardly
say
that
he
had
made
the
matter
a
subject
of
the
most
earnest
prayer
and
had
entreated
the
lord
for
guidance
when
he
felt
attracted
to
this
particular
villa
he
did
not
doubt
that
he
was
directed
to
it
in
answer
to
his
supplication
and
he
wasted
no
time
in
further
balancing
or
inquiring
on
my
eighth
birthday
with
bag
and
baggage
complete
we
all
made
the
toilful
journey
down
into
devonshire
and
i
was
a
no
longer
chapter
v
a
new
element
now
entered
into
my
life
a
fresh
rival
arose
to
compete
for
me
with
my
father
dogmatic
theology
this
rival
was
the
sea
when
wordsworth
was
a
little
child
the
presence
of
the
mountains
and
the
clouds
lighted
up
his
spirit
with
gleams
that
were
like
the
flashing
of
a
shield
he
has
described
in
the
marvellous
pages
of
the
the
impact
of
nature
upon
the
infant
soul
but
he
has
described
it
vaguely
and
faintly
with
some
of
love
for
days
disowned
by
memory
i
think
because
he
was
brought
up
in
the
midst
of
spectacular
beauty
and
could
name
no
moment
mark
no
or
when
the
wonder
broke
upon
him
it
was
at
the
age
of
twice
five
summers
he
thought
that
he
began
to
hold
unconscious
intercourse
with
nature
in
a
pure
organic
pleasure
from
the
floating
mists
and
winding
waters
perhaps
in
his
anxiety
to
be
truthful
and
in
the
absence
of
any
record
he
put
the
date
of
this
conscious
rapture
too
late
rather
than
too
early
certainly
my
own
impregnation
with
the
but
loveliness
of
the
open
sea
dates
from
the
first
week
of
my
ninth
year
the
village
on
the
outskirts
of
which
we
had
taken
up
our
abode
was
built
parallel
to
the
cliff
line
above
the
shore
but
half
a
mile
inland
for
a
long
time
after
the
date
i
have
now
reached
no
other
form
of
natural
scenery
than
the
sea
had
any
effect
upon
me
at
all
the
tors
of
the
distant
moor
might
be
drawn
in
deep
blue
against
the
pallor
of
our
morning
or
our
evening
sky
but
i
never
looked
at
them
it
was
the
sea
always
the
sea
nothing
but
the
sea
from
our
house
or
from
the
field
at
the
back
of
our
house
or
from
any
part
of
the
village
itself
there
was
no
appearance
to
suggest
that
there
could
lie
anything
in
an
easterly
direction
to
break
the
infinitude
of
red
ploughed
fields
but
on
that
earliest
morning
how
my
heart
remembers
we
hastened
miss
marks
the
maid
and
i
between
them
along
a
couple
of
lanes
when
suddenly
far
below
us
in
an
immense
arc
of
light
there
stretched
the
enormous
plain
of
waters
we
had
but
to
cross
a
step
or
two
of
downs
when
the
hollow
sides
of
the
great
limestone
cove
yawned
at
our
feet
descending
like
a
broken
cup
down
down
to
the
moon
of
white
shingle
and
the
expanse
of
sea
in
these
days
a
careful
municipality
has
studded
the
down
with
rustic
seats
and
has
shut
its
dangers
out
with
railings
has
cut
a
winding
round
the
curves
of
the
cove
down
to
the
shore
and
has
planted
at
intervals
in
clearings
made
for
that
aesthetic
purpose
when
last
i
saw
the
place
thus
smartened
and
secured
with
its
hair
in
and
its
feet
in
i
turned
from
it
in
anger
and
disgust
and
could
almost
have
wept
i
suppose
that
to
those
who
knew
it
in
no
other
guise
it
may
still
have
beauty
no
parish
councils
beneficent
and
shrewd
can
obscure
the
lustre
of
the
waters
or
compress
the
vastness
of
the
sky
but
what
man
could
do
to
make
wild
beauty
ineffectual
tame
and
empty
has
amply
been
performed
at
oddicombe
very
different
was
it
fifty
years
ago
in
its
uncouth
majesty
no
road
save
the
merest
led
down
its
concave
wilderness
in
which
loose
and
untrimmed
brambles
wantoned
into
the
likeness
of
trees
each
draped
in
audacious
tissue
of
wild
clematis
through
this
fantastic
maze
the
traveller
wound
his
way
led
by
little
other
clue
than
by
the
instinct
of
descent
for
me
as
a
child
it
meant
the
labour
of
a
long
an
endless
morning
to
descend
to
the
pebbles
to
sport
at
the
edge
of
the
cold
sharp
sea
and
then
to
climb
up
home
again
slipping
in
the
sticky
red
mud
clutching
at
the
smooth
boughs
of
the
wild
ash
toiling
toiling
upwards
into
flat
land
out
of
that
hollow
world
of
rocks
on
the
first
occasion
i
recollect
our
cockney
housemaid
enthusiastic
young
creature
that
she
was
flung
herself
down
upon
her
knees
and
drank
of
the
salt
waters
miss
marks
more
instructed
in
phenomena
refrained
but
i
although
i
was
perfectly
aware
what
the
taste
would
be
insisted
on
sipping
a
few
drops
from
the
palm
of
my
hand
this
was
a
slight
recurrence
of
what
i
have
called
my
magic
practices
which
had
passed
into
the
background
of
my
mind
but
had
not
quite
disappeared
i
recollect
that
i
thought
i
might
secure
some
power
of
walking
on
the
sea
if
i
drank
of
it
a
perfectly
irrational
movement
of
mind
like
those
of
savages
my
great
desire
was
to
walk
out
over
the
sea
as
far
as
i
could
and
then
lie
flat
on
it
face
downwards
and
peer
into
the
depths
i
was
tormented
with
this
ambition
and
like
many
up
people
was
so
fully
occupied
by
these
vain
and
ridiculous
desires
that
i
neglected
the
actual
natural
pleasures
around
me
the
idea
was
not
quite
so
demented
as
it
may
seem
because
we
were
in
the
habit
of
singing
as
well
as
reading
of
those
enraptured
beings
who
spend
their
days
in
down
their
golden
crowns
upon
the
jasper
sea
why
i
argued
should
i
not
be
able
to
fling
down
my
straw
hat
upon
the
tides
of
oddicombe
and
without
question
a
majestic
scene
upon
the
lake
of
gennesaret
had
also
inflamed
my
fancy
of
all
these
things
of
course
i
was
careful
to
speak
to
no
one
it
was
not
with
miss
marks
however
but
with
my
father
that
i
became
accustomed
to
make
the
laborious
and
exquisite
journeys
down
to
the
sea
and
back
again
his
work
as
a
naturalist
eventually
took
him
laden
with
implements
to
the
on
the
shore
and
i
was
in
attendance
as
an
acolyte
but
our
earliest
winter
in
south
devon
was
darkened
for
us
both
by
disappointments
the
cause
of
which
lay
at
the
time
far
out
of
my
reach
in
the
spirit
of
my
father
were
then
running
with
furious
velocity
two
hostile
streams
of
influence
i
was
standing
just
now
thinking
of
these
things
where
the
cascine
ends
in
the
wooded
point
which
is
carved
out
sharply
by
the
coloured
swirl
of
the
arno
on
the
one
side
and
by
the
pure
flow
of
the
mugnone
on
the
other
the
rivers
meet
and
run
parallel
but
there
comes
a
moment
when
the
one
or
the
other
must
conquer
and
it
is
the
yellow
vehemence
that
drowns
the
purer
tide
so
through
my
father
brain
in
that
year
of
scientific
crisis
there
rushed
two
kinds
of
thought
each
absorbing
each
convincing
yet
totally
irreconcilable
there
is
a
peculiar
agony
in
the
paradox
that
truth
has
two
forms
each
of
them
indisputable
yet
each
antagonistic
to
the
other
it
was
this
discovery
that
there
were
two
theories
of
physical
life
each
of
which
was
true
but
the
truth
of
each
incompatible
with
the
truth
of
the
other
which
shook
the
spirit
of
my
father
with
perturbation
it
was
not
really
a
paradox
it
was
a
fallacy
if
he
could
only
have
known
it
but
he
allowed
the
turbid
volume
of
superstition
to
drown
the
delicate
stream
of
reason
he
took
one
step
in
the
service
of
truth
and
then
he
drew
back
in
an
agony
and
accepted
the
servitude
of
error
this
was
the
great
moment
in
the
history
of
thought
when
the
theory
of
the
mutability
of
species
was
preparing
to
throw
a
flood
of
light
upon
all
departments
of
human
speculation
and
action
it
was
becoming
necessary
to
stand
emphatically
in
one
army
or
the
other
lyell
was
surrounding
himself
with
disciples
who
were
making
strides
in
the
direction
of
discovery
darwin
had
long
been
collecting
facts
with
regard
to
the
variation
of
animals
and
plants
hooker
and
wallace
asa
gray
and
even
agassiz
each
in
his
own
sphere
were
coming
closer
and
closer
to
a
perception
of
that
secret
which
was
first
to
reveal
itself
clearly
to
the
patient
and
humble
genius
of
darwin
in
the
year
before
in
darwin
under
pressure
from
lyell
had
begun
that
modest
statement
of
the
new
revelation
that
of
an
essay
which
developed
so
mightily
into
origin
of
species
wollaston
of
species
had
just
appeared
and
had
been
a
nine
days
wonder
in
the
wilderness
on
the
other
side
the
reactionaries
although
never
dreaming
of
the
fate
which
hung
over
them
had
not
been
idle
in
the
astounding
question
had
for
the
first
time
been
propounded
with
contumely
then
did
we
come
from
an
the
famous
of
creation
had
been
supplying
a
water
panacea
for
those
who
could
not
escape
from
the
trend
of
evidence
and
who
yet
clung
to
revelation
owen
was
encouraging
reaction
by
resisting
with
all
the
strength
of
his
prestige
the
theory
of
the
mutability
of
species
in
this
period
of
intellectual
ferment
as
when
a
great
political
revolution
is
being
planned
many
possible
adherents
were
confidentially
tested
with
hints
and
encouraged
to
reveal
their
bias
in
a
whisper
it
was
the
notion
of
lyell
himself
a
great
mover
of
men
that
before
the
doctrine
of
natural
selection
was
given
to
a
world
which
would
be
sure
to
lift
up
at
it
a
howl
of
execration
a
certain
bodyguard
of
sound
and
experienced
naturalists
expert
in
the
description
of
species
should
be
privately
made
aware
of
its
tenor
among
those
who
were
thus
initiated
or
approached
with
a
view
towards
possible
illumination
was
my
father
he
was
spoken
to
by
hooker
and
later
on
by
darwin
after
meetings
of
the
royal
society
in
the
summer
of
my
father
attitude
towards
the
theory
of
natural
selection
was
critical
in
his
career
and
oddly
enough
it
exercised
an
immense
influence
on
my
own
experience
as
a
child
let
it
be
admitted
at
once
mournful
as
the
admission
is
that
every
instinct
in
his
intelligence
went
out
at
first
to
greet
the
new
light
it
had
hardly
done
so
when
a
recollection
of
the
opening
chapter
of
checked
it
at
the
outset
he
consulted
with
carpenter
a
great
investigator
but
one
who
was
fully
as
incapable
as
himself
of
remodelling
his
ideas
with
regard
to
the
old
accepted
hypotheses
they
both
determined
on
various
grounds
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
terrible
theory
but
to
hold
steadily
to
the
law
of
the
fixity
of
species
it
was
exactly
at
this
juncture
that
we
left
london
and
the
slight
and
occasional
but
always
extremely
salutary
personal
intercourse
with
men
of
scientific
leading
which
my
father
had
enjoyed
at
the
british
museum
and
at
the
royal
society
came
to
an
end
his
next
act
was
to
burn
his
ships
down
to
the
last
beam
and
log
out
of
which
a
raft
could
have
been
made
by
a
strange
act
of
wilfulness
he
closed
the
doors
upon
himself
forever
my
father
had
never
admired
sir
charles
lyell
i
think
that
the
famous
chancellor
manner
of
the
geologist
intimidated
him
and
we
undervalue
the
intelligence
of
those
whose
conversation
puts
us
at
a
disadvantage
for
darwin
and
hooker
on
the
other
hand
he
had
a
profound
esteem
and
i
know
not
whether
this
had
anything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
chose
for
his
impetuous
experiment
in
reaction
the
field
of
geology
rather
than
that
of
zoology
or
botany
lyell
had
been
threatening
to
publish
a
book
on
the
geological
history
of
man
which
was
to
be
a
bombshell
flung
into
the
camp
of
the
catastrophists
my
father
after
long
reflection
prepared
a
theory
of
his
own
which
as
he
fondly
hoped
would
take
the
wind
out
of
lyell
sails
and
justify
geology
to
godly
readers
of
it
was
very
briefly
that
there
had
been
no
gradual
modification
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
or
slow
development
of
organic
forms
but
that
when
the
catastrophic
act
of
creation
took
place
the
world
presented
instantly
the
structural
appearance
of
a
planet
on
which
life
had
long
existed
the
theory
coarsely
enough
and
to
my
father
great
indignation
was
defined
by
a
hasty
press
as
being
this
that
god
hid
the
fossils
in
the
rocks
in
order
to
tempt
geologists
into
infidelity
in
truth
it
was
the
logical
and
inevitable
conclusion
of
accepting
literally
the
doctrine
of
a
sudden
act
of
creation
it
emphasized
the
fact
that
any
breach
in
the
circular
course
of
nature
could
be
conceived
only
on
the
supposition
that
the
object
created
bore
false
witness
to
past
processes
which
had
never
taken
place
for
instance
adam
would
certainly
possess
hair
and
teeth
and
bones
in
a
condition
which
it
must
have
taken
many
years
to
accomplish
yet
he
was
created
yesterday
he
would
certainly
though
sir
thomas
browne
denied
it
display
an
yet
no
umbilical
cord
had
ever
attached
him
to
a
mother
never
was
a
book
cast
upon
the
waters
with
greater
anticipations
of
success
than
was
this
curious
this
obstinate
this
fanatical
volume
my
father
lived
in
a
fever
of
suspense
waiting
for
the
tremendous
issue
this
of
his
he
thought
was
to
bring
all
the
turmoil
of
scientific
speculation
to
a
close
fling
geology
into
the
arms
of
scripture
and
make
the
lion
eat
grass
with
the
lamb
it
was
not
surprising
he
admitted
that
there
had
been
experienced
an
discord
between
the
facts
which
geology
brings
to
light
and
the
direct
statements
of
the
early
chapters
of
nobody
was
to
blame
for
that
my
father
and
my
father
alone
possessed
the
secret
of
the
enigma
he
alone
held
the
key
which
could
smoothly
open
the
lock
of
geological
mystery
he
offered
it
with
a
glowing
gesture
to
atheists
and
christians
alike
this
was
to
be
the
universal
panacea
this
the
system
of
intellectual
therapeutics
which
could
not
but
heal
all
the
maladies
of
the
age
but
alas
atheists
and
christians
alike
looked
at
it
and
laughed
and
threw
it
away
in
the
course
of
that
dismal
winter
as
the
post
began
to
bring
in
private
letters
few
and
chilly
and
public
reviews
many
and
scornful
my
father
looked
in
vain
for
the
approval
of
the
churches
and
in
vain
for
the
acquiescence
of
the
scientific
societies
and
in
vain
for
the
gratitude
of
those
of
thinking
persons
which
he
had
rashly
assured
himself
of
receiving
as
his
reconciliation
of
scripture
statements
and
geological
deductions
was
welcomed
nowhere
as
darwin
continued
silent
and
the
youthful
huxley
was
scornful
and
even
charles
kingsley
from
whom
my
father
had
expected
the
most
instant
appreciation
wrote
that
he
could
not
up
the
painful
and
slow
conclusion
of
five
and
twenty
years
study
of
geology
and
believe
that
god
has
written
on
the
rocks
one
enormous
and
superfluous
lie
as
all
this
happened
or
failed
to
happen
a
gloom
cold
and
dismal
descended
upon
our
morning
teacups
it
was
what
the
poets
mean
by
an
gloom
it
thickened
day
by
day
as
hope
and
evaporated
in
thin
clouds
of
disappointment
my
father
was
not
prepared
for
such
a
fate
he
had
been
the
spoiled
darling
of
the
public
the
constant
favourite
of
the
press
and
now
like
the
dark
angels
of
old
so
huge
a
rout
encumbered
him
with
ruin
he
could
not
recover
from
amazement
at
having
offended
everybody
by
an
enterprise
which
had
been
undertaken
in
the
cause
of
universal
reconciliation
during
that
grim
season
my
father
was
no
lively
companion
and
circumstance
after
circumstance
combined
to
drive
him
further
from
humanity
he
missed
more
than
ever
the
sympathetic
ear
of
my
mother
there
was
present
to
support
him
nothing
of
that
artful
female
casuistry
which
insinuates
into
the
wounded
consciousness
of
a
man
the
conviction
that
after
all
he
is
right
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
is
wrong
my
father
used
to
tramp
in
solitude
around
and
around
the
red
ploughed
field
which
was
going
to
be
his
lawn
or
sheltering
himself
from
the
thin
devonian
rain
pace
up
and
down
the
verandah
where
blossoming
creepers
were
to
be
and
i
think
that
there
was
added
to
his
chagrin
with
all
his
fellow
mortals
a
first
tincture
of
that
heresy
which
was
to
attack
him
later
on
it
was
now
that
i
fancy
he
began
in
his
depression
to
be
angry
with
god
how
much
devotion
had
he
given
how
many
sacrifices
had
he
made
only
to
be
left
storming
around
this
red
morass
with
no
one
in
all
the
world
to
care
for
him
except
one
child
with
its
cheek
pressed
to
the
window
after
one
or
two
brilliant
excursions
to
the
sea
winter
in
its
dampest
muddiest
most
languid
form
had
fallen
upon
us
and
shut
us
in
it
was
a
dreary
winter
for
the
wifeless
man
and
the
motherless
boy
we
had
come
into
the
house
in
precipitate
abandonment
to
that
supposed
answer
to
prayer
a
great
deal
too
soon
in
order
to
rake
together
the
lump
sum
for
buying
it
my
father
had
denuded
himself
of
almost
everything
and
our
sticks
of
chairs
and
tables
filled
but
two
or
three
rooms
half
the
little
house
or
as
we
called
it
was
not
papered
thirds
were
not
furnished
the
workmen
were
still
finishing
the
outside
when
we
arrived
and
in
that
connection
i
recall
a
little
incident
which
exhibits
my
father
morbid
delicacy
of
conscience
he
was
accustomed
in
his
brighter
moments
and
this
was
before
the
publication
of
his
occasionally
to
sing
loud
dorsetshire
songs
of
his
early
days
in
a
strange
broad
wessex
lingo
that
i
loved
one
october
afternoon
he
and
i
were
sitting
on
the
verandah
and
my
father
was
singing
just
around
the
corner
out
of
sight
two
carpenters
were
putting
up
the
framework
of
a
greenhouse
in
a
pause
one
of
them
said
to
his
fellow
can
zing
a
zong
zo
well
another
though
he
be
a
minister
my
father
who
was
holding
my
hand
loosely
clutched
it
and
looking
up
i
saw
his
eyes
darken
he
never
sang
a
secular
song
again
during
the
whole
of
his
life
later
in
the
year
and
after
his
literary
misfortune
his
conscience
became
more
troublesome
than
ever
i
think
he
considered
the
failure
of
his
attempt
at
the
reconciliation
of
science
with
religion
to
have
been
intended
by
god
as
a
punishment
for
something
he
had
done
or
left
undone
in
those
brooding
tramps
around
and
around
the
garden
his
soul
was
on
its
knees
searching
the
corners
of
his
conscience
for
some
sin
of
omission
or
commission
and
one
by
one
every
pleasure
every
recreation
every
trifle
scraped
out
of
the
dust
of
past
experience
was
magnified
into
a
huge
offence
he
thought
that
the
smallest
evidence
of
levity
the
least
unbending
to
human
instinct
might
be
seized
by
those
around
him
as
evidence
of
inconsistency
and
might
lead
the
weaker
brethren
into
offence
the
incident
of
the
carpenters
and
the
comic
song
is
typical
of
a
condition
of
mind
which
now
possessed
my
father
in
which
act
after
act
became
taboo
not
because
each
was
sinful
in
itself
but
because
it
might
lead
others
into
sin
i
have
the
conviction
that
miss
marks
was
now
mightily
afraid
of
my
father
whenever
she
could
she
withdrew
to
the
room
she
called
her
a
small
chilly
apartment
sparsely
furnished
looking
over
what
was
in
process
of
becoming
the
vegetable
garden
very
properly
that
she
might
have
some
sanctuary
miss
marks
forbade
me
to
enter
this
virginal
bower
which
of
course
became
to
me
an
object
of
harrowing
curiosity
through
the
i
could
see
practically
nothing
one
day
i
contrived
to
slip
inside
and
discovered
that
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
a
plain
bedstead
and
a
void
of
all
attraction
in
this
on
winter
afternoons
a
fire
would
be
lighted
and
miss
marks
would
withdraw
to
it
not
seen
by
us
anymore
between
and
the
apocalyptic
exercise
known
as
in
less
strenuous
households
much
less
austerely
practised
under
the
name
of
prayers
left
meanwhile
to
our
own
devices
my
father
would
mainly
be
reading
his
book
or
paper
held
close
up
to
the
candle
while
his
lips
and
heavy
eyebrows
occasionally
quivered
and
palpitated
with
literary
ardour
in
a
manner
strangely
exciting
to
me
miss
marks
in
a
very
high
cap
and
her
large
teeth
shining
would
occasionally
appear
in
the
doorway
desiring
with
spurious
geniality
to
know
how
we
were
on
but
on
these
occasions
neither
of
us
replied
to
miss
marks
sometimes
in
the
course
of
this
winter
my
father
and
i
had
long
cosy
talks
together
over
the
fire
our
favourite
subject
was
murders
i
wonder
whether
little
boys
of
eight
soon
to
go
upstairs
alone
at
night
often
discuss
violent
crime
with
a
the
practice
i
can
not
help
thinking
is
unusual
it
was
however
consecutive
with
us
we
tried
other
secular
subjects
but
we
were
sure
to
come
around
at
last
to
do
you
suppose
they
really
did
with
the
body
i
was
told
a
thrilled
listener
the
adventure
of
manning
who
killed
a
gentleman
on
the
stairs
and
buried
him
in
in
the
and
it
was
at
this
time
that
i
learned
the
useful
historical
fact
which
abides
with
me
after
half
a
century
that
manning
was
hanged
in
black
satin
which
thereupon
went
wholly
out
of
fashion
in
england
i
also
heard
about
burke
and
hare
whose
story
nearly
froze
me
into
stone
with
horror
these
were
crimes
which
appear
in
the
chronicles
but
who
will
tell
me
what
mystery
was
which
my
father
and
i
discussed
evening
after
evening
i
have
never
come
across
a
whisper
of
it
since
and
i
suspect
it
of
having
been
a
hoax
as
i
recall
the
details
people
in
a
boat
passing
down
the
thames
saw
a
hung
high
in
air
on
one
of
the
projections
of
a
pier
of
waterloo
bridge
being
with
difficulty
dragged
down
or
perhaps
up
this
bag
was
found
to
be
full
of
human
remains
dreadful
butcher
business
of
joints
and
fragments
persons
were
missed
were
identified
were
again
denied
the
whole
is
a
vapour
in
my
memory
which
shifts
as
i
try
to
define
it
but
clear
enough
is
the
picture
i
hold
of
myself
in
a
high
chair
on
the
hand
side
of
the
fireplace
the
leaping
flames
reflected
in
the
of
tropical
insects
on
the
opposite
wall
and
my
father
leaning
anxiously
forward
with
uplifted
finger
emphasizing
to
me
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
horrible
evidence
i
suppose
that
my
interest
in
these
discussions
and
heaven
knows
i
was
animated
enough
amused
and
distracted
my
father
whose
idea
of
a
suitable
theme
for
childhood
ear
now
seems
to
me
surprising
i
soon
found
that
these
subjects
were
not
welcome
to
everybody
for
starting
the
mystery
one
morning
with
miss
marks
in
the
hope
of
delaying
my
arithmetic
lesson
she
fairly
threw
her
apron
over
her
ears
and
told
me
from
that
vantage
that
if
i
did
not
desist
at
once
she
should
scream
occasionally
we
took
winter
walks
together
my
father
and
i
down
some
lane
that
led
to
a
sight
of
the
sea
or
over
the
rolling
downs
we
tried
to
recapture
the
charm
of
those
delightful
strolls
in
london
when
we
used
to
lean
over
the
bridges
and
watch
the
ducks
but
we
could
not
recover
this
pleasure
my
father
was
deeply
enwoven
in
the
chain
of
his
own
thoughts
and
would
stalk
on
without
a
word
buried
in
angry
reverie
if
he
spoke
to
me
on
these
excursions
it
was
a
pain
to
me
to
answer
him
i
could
talk
on
easy
terms
with
him
indoors
seated
in
my
high
chair
with
our
heads
on
a
level
but
it
was
intolerably
laborious
to
look
up
into
the
firmament
and
converse
with
a
dark
face
against
the
sky
the
actual
exercise
of
walking
too
was
very
exhausting
to
me
the
bright
red
mud
to
the
strange
colour
of
which
i
could
not
for
a
long
while
get
accustomed
becoming
caked
about
my
little
shoes
and
wearying
me
extremely
i
would
grow
petulant
and
cross
contradict
my
father
and
oppose
his
whims
these
walks
were
distressing
to
us
both
yet
he
did
not
like
to
walk
alone
and
he
had
no
other
friend
however
as
the
winter
advanced
they
had
to
be
abandoned
and
the
habit
of
our
taking
a
together
was
never
resumed
i
look
back
upon
myself
at
this
time
as
upon
a
cantankerous
tempered
and
unobliging
child
the
only
excuse
i
can
offer
is
that
i
really
was
not
well
the
change
to
devonshire
had
not
suited
me
my
health
gave
the
excellent
miss
marks
some
anxiety
but
she
was
not
ready
in
resource
the
dampness
of
the
house
was
terrible
indoors
and
out
the
atmosphere
seemed
soaked
in
chilly
vapours
under
my
at
night
i
shook
like
a
jelly
unable
to
sleep
for
cold
though
i
was
heaped
with
coverings
while
my
skin
was
all
puckered
with
gooseflesh
i
could
eat
nothing
solid
without
suffering
immediately
from
violent
hiccough
so
that
much
of
my
time
was
spent
lying
prone
on
my
back
upon
the
hearthrug
awakening
the
echoes
like
a
cuckoo
miss
marks
therefore
cut
off
all
food
but
a
loathly
bowl
of
which
appeared
at
every
meal
in
consequence
the
hiccough
lessened
but
my
strength
declined
with
it
i
languished
in
a
perpetual
catarrh
i
was
roused
to
a
that
i
was
not
considered
well
by
the
fact
that
my
father
prayed
publicly
at
morning
and
evening
that
if
it
was
the
lord
will
to
take
me
to
himself
there
might
be
no
doubt
whatever
about
my
being
a
sealed
child
of
god
and
an
inheritor
of
glory
i
was
partly
disconcerted
by
partly
vain
of
this
open
advertisement
of
my
ailments
of
our
dealings
with
the
a
fresh
assortment
of
whom
met
us
on
our
arrival
in
devonshire
i
shall
speak
presently
my
father
austerity
of
behaviour
was
i
think
perpetually
accentuated
by
his
fear
of
doing
anything
to
offend
the
consciences
of
these
persons
whom
he
supposed
no
doubt
to
be
more
sensitive
than
they
really
were
he
was
fond
of
saying
that
very
little
stain
upon
the
conscience
makes
a
wide
breach
in
our
communion
with
god
and
he
counted
possible
errors
of
conduct
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
it
was
in
this
winter
that
his
attention
was
particularly
drawn
to
the
festival
of
christmas
which
apparently
he
had
scarcely
noticed
in
london
on
the
subject
of
all
feasts
of
the
church
he
held
views
of
an
almost
grotesque
peculiarity
he
looked
upon
each
of
them
as
nugatory
and
worthless
but
the
keeping
of
christmas
appeared
to
him
by
far
the
most
hateful
and
nothing
less
than
an
act
of
idolatry
very
word
is
popish
he
used
to
exclaim
mass
pursing
up
his
lips
with
the
gesture
of
one
who
tastes
assafoetida
by
accident
then
he
would
adduce
the
antiquity
of
the
feast
adapted
from
horrible
heathen
rites
and
itself
a
soiled
relic
of
the
abominable
he
would
denounce
the
horrors
of
christmas
until
it
almost
made
me
blush
to
look
at
a
on
christmas
day
of
this
year
our
villa
saw
a
very
unusual
sight
my
father
had
given
strictest
charge
that
no
difference
whatever
was
to
be
made
in
our
meals
on
that
day
the
dinner
was
to
be
neither
more
copious
than
usual
nor
less
so
he
was
obeyed
but
the
servants
secretly
rebellious
made
a
small
for
themselves
i
discovered
afterwards
with
pain
that
miss
marks
received
a
slice
of
it
in
her
boudoir
early
in
the
afternoon
the
maids
of
whom
we
were
now
advanced
to
keeping
two
kindly
remarked
that
poor
dear
child
ought
to
have
a
bit
anyhow
and
wheedled
me
into
the
kitchen
where
i
ate
a
slice
of
shortly
i
began
to
feel
that
pain
inside
which
in
my
frail
state
was
inevitable
and
my
conscience
smote
me
violently
at
length
i
could
bear
my
spiritual
anguish
no
longer
and
bursting
into
the
study
i
called
out
papa
papa
i
have
eaten
of
flesh
offered
to
idols
it
took
some
time
between
my
sobs
to
explain
what
had
happened
then
my
father
sternly
said
is
the
accursed
thing
i
explained
that
as
much
as
was
left
of
it
was
still
on
the
kitchen
table
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
ran
with
me
into
the
midst
of
the
startled
servants
seized
what
remained
of
the
pudding
and
with
the
plate
in
one
hand
and
me
still
tight
in
the
other
ran
until
we
reached
the
when
he
flung
the
idolatrous
confectionery
on
to
the
middle
of
the
ashes
and
then
raked
it
deep
down
into
the
mass
the
suddenness
the
violence
the
velocity
of
this
extraordinary
act
made
an
impression
on
my
memory
which
nothing
will
ever
efface
the
key
is
lost
by
which
i
might
unlock
the
perverse
malady
from
which
my
father
conscience
seemed
to
suffer
during
the
whole
of
this
melancholy
winter
but
i
think
that
a
dislocation
of
his
intellectual
system
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
up
to
this
point
in
his
career
he
had
as
we
have
seen
nourished
the
delusion
that
science
and
revelation
could
be
mutually
justified
that
some
sort
of
compromise
was
possible
with
great
and
ever
greater
distinctness
his
investigations
had
shown
him
that
in
all
departments
of
organic
nature
there
are
visible
the
evidences
of
slow
modification
of
forms
of
the
type
developed
by
the
pressure
and
practice
of
aeons
this
conviction
had
been
borne
in
upon
him
until
it
was
positively
irresistible
where
was
his
place
then
as
a
sincere
and
accurate
observer
manifestly
it
was
with
the
pioneers
of
the
new
truth
it
was
with
darwin
wallace
and
hooker
but
did
not
the
second
chapter
of
say
that
in
six
days
the
heavens
and
earth
were
finished
and
the
host
of
them
and
that
on
the
seventh
day
god
ended
his
work
which
he
had
made
here
was
a
dilemma
geology
certainly
seemed
to
be
true
but
the
bible
which
was
god
word
was
true
if
the
bible
said
that
all
things
in
heaven
and
earth
were
created
in
six
days
created
in
six
days
they
were
in
six
literal
days
of
hours
each
the
evidences
of
spontaneous
variation
of
form
acting
over
an
immense
space
of
time
upon
organic
structures
seemed
overwhelming
but
they
must
either
be
brought
into
line
with
the
labour
of
creation
or
they
must
be
rejected
i
have
already
shown
how
my
father
worked
out
the
ingenious
theory
in
order
to
justify
himself
as
a
strictly
scientific
observer
who
was
also
a
humble
slave
of
revelation
but
the
old
convention
and
the
new
rebellion
would
alike
have
none
of
his
compromise
to
a
mind
so
acute
and
at
the
same
time
so
narrow
as
that
of
my
father
a
mind
which
is
all
logical
and
positive
without
breadth
without
suppleness
and
without
imagination
to
be
subjected
to
a
check
of
this
kind
is
agony
it
has
not
the
relief
of
a
smaller
nature
which
escapes
from
the
dilemma
by
some
foggy
formula
nor
the
resolution
of
a
larger
nature
to
take
to
its
wings
and
surmount
the
obstacle
my
father
although
half
suffocated
by
the
emotion
of
being
lifted
as
it
were
on
the
great
biological
wave
never
dreamed
of
letting
go
his
clutch
of
the
ancient
tradition
but
hung
there
strained
and
buffeted
it
is
extraordinary
that
he
an
hodman
of
science
as
huxley
once
called
him
should
not
have
been
content
to
allow
others
whose
horizons
were
wider
than
his
could
be
to
pursue
those
purely
intellectual
surveys
for
which
he
had
no
species
of
aptitude
as
a
collector
of
facts
and
marshaller
of
observations
he
had
not
a
rival
in
that
age
his
very
absence
of
imagination
aided
him
in
this
work
but
he
was
more
an
attorney
than
philosopher
and
he
lacked
that
sublime
humility
which
is
the
crown
of
genius
for
this
obstinate
persuasion
that
he
alone
knew
the
mind
of
god
that
he
alone
could
interpret
the
designs
of
the
creator
what
did
it
result
from
if
not
from
a
congenital
lack
of
that
highest
modesty
which
replies
do
not
know
even
to
the
questions
which
faith
with
menacing
forger
insists
on
having
most
positively
answered
chapter
vi
during
the
first
year
of
our
life
in
devonshire
the
ninth
year
of
my
age
my
father
existence
and
therefore
mine
was
almost
entirely
divided
between
attending
to
the
little
community
of
in
the
village
and
collecting
examining
and
describing
marine
creatures
from
the
seashore
in
the
course
of
these
twelve
months
we
had
scarcely
any
social
distractions
of
any
kind
and
i
never
once
crossed
the
bounds
of
the
parish
after
the
worst
of
the
winter
was
over
my
father
recovered
much
of
his
spirits
and
his
power
of
work
and
the
earliest
sunshine
soothed
and
refreshed
us
both
i
was
still
almost
always
with
him
but
we
had
now
some
curious
companions
the
village
at
the
southern
end
of
which
our
villa
stood
was
not
pretty
it
had
no
rural
picturesqueness
of
any
kind
the
only
pleasant
feature
of
it
the
handsome
and
ancient
parish
church
with
its
umbrageous
churchyard
was
then
almost
entirely
concealed
by
a
congress
of
mean
shops
which
were
ultimately
before
the
close
of
my
childhood
removed
the
village
consisted
of
two
parallel
lines
of
contiguous
houses
all
and
most
of
them
fronted
by
a
trifling
for
half
a
mile
this
street
ascended
to
the
church
and
then
descended
for
another
ending
suddenly
in
fields
the
hedges
of
which
displayed
at
intervals
the
inevitable
pollard
the
walk
through
the
village
which
we
seemed
make
incessantly
was
very
wearisome
to
me
i
dreaded
the
rudeness
of
the
children
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
shops
to
amuse
me
walking
on
the
inch
or
two
of
broken
pavement
in
front
of
the
houses
was
disagreeable
and
tiresome
and
the
odor
which
breathed
on
close
days
from
the
open
doors
and
windows
made
me
feel
faint
but
this
walk
was
obligatory
since
the
room
as
our
little
chapel
was
called
lay
at
the
farther
extremity
of
the
dreary
street
we
attended
this
place
of
worship
immediately
on
our
arrival
and
my
father
uninvited
but
unresisted
immediately
assumed
the
administration
of
it
it
was
a
square
empty
room
built
for
i
know
not
what
purpose
over
a
stable
ammoniac
odours
used
to
rise
through
the
floor
as
we
sat
there
at
our
long
devotions
before
our
coming
a
little
flock
of
persons
met
in
the
room
a
community
of
the
indefinite
sort
just
then
becoming
frequent
in
the
west
of
england
pious
rustics
connected
with
no
other
recognized
body
of
christians
and
depending
directly
on
the
independent
study
of
the
bible
they
were
largely
women
but
there
was
more
than
a
sprinkling
of
men
poor
simple
and
generally
sickly
in
later
days
under
my
father
ministration
the
body
increased
and
positively
flourished
it
came
to
include
retired
professional
men
an
admiral
nay
even
the
brother
of
a
peer
but
in
those
earliest
years
the
and
were
all
of
them
ordinary
peasants
they
were
jobbing
gardeners
and
journeymen
carpenters
masons
and
tailors
washerwomen
and
domestic
servants
i
wish
that
i
could
paint
in
colours
so
vivid
that
my
readers
could
perceive
what
their
little
society
consisted
of
this
quaint
collection
of
humble
conscientious
ignorant
and
gentle
persons
in
chronicle
or
fiction
i
have
never
been
fortunate
enough
to
meet
with
anything
which
resembled
them
the
caricatures
of
enmity
and
worldly
scorn
are
as
crude
to
my
memory
as
the
unction
of
religious
conventionality
is
featureless
the
origin
of
the
meeting
had
been
odd
a
few
years
before
we
came
a
crew
of
cornish
fishermen
quite
unknown
to
the
villagers
were
driven
by
stress
of
weather
into
the
haven
under
the
cliff
they
landed
and
instead
of
going
to
a
they
looked
about
for
a
room
where
they
could
hold
a
meeting
they
were
devout
wesleyans
they
had
come
from
the
open
sea
they
were
far
from
home
and
they
had
been
starved
by
lack
of
their
customary
religious
privileges
as
they
stood
about
in
the
street
before
their
meeting
they
challenged
the
respectable
girls
who
came
out
to
stare
at
them
with
the
question
you
love
the
lord
jesus
my
maid
receiving
dubious
answers
they
pressed
the
inhabitants
to
come
in
and
pray
with
them
which
several
did
ann
burmington
who
long
afterwards
told
me
about
it
was
one
of
those
girls
and
she
repeated
that
the
fishermen
said
a
dreadful
thing
it
will
be
at
the
last
day
when
the
lord
says
come
ye
blessed
and
says
it
not
to
you
and
then
depart
ye
cursed
and
you
maidens
have
to
depart
they
were
young
men
with
black
beards
and
shining
eyes
and
i
do
not
question
that
some
flash
of
sex
unconsciously
mingled
with
the
curious
episode
although
their
behaviour
was
in
all
respects
discreet
it
was
perhaps
not
wholly
a
coincidence
that
almost
all
those
particular
girls
remained
unmarried
to
the
end
of
their
lives
after
two
or
three
days
the
fishermen
went
off
to
sea
again
they
prayed
and
sailed
away
and
the
girls
who
had
not
even
asked
their
names
never
heard
of
them
again
but
several
of
the
young
women
were
definitely
converted
and
they
formed
the
nucleus
of
our
little
gathering
my
father
preached
standing
at
a
desk
or
celebrated
the
communion
in
front
of
a
deal
table
with
a
white
napkin
spread
over
it
sometimes
the
audience
was
so
small
generally
so
unexhilarating
that
he
was
discouraged
but
he
never
flagged
in
energy
and
zeal
only
those
who
had
given
evidence
of
intelligent
acceptance
of
the
theory
of
simple
faith
in
their
atonement
through
the
blood
of
jesus
were
admitted
to
the
communion
or
as
it
was
called
breaking
of
bread
it
was
made
a
very
strong
point
that
no
one
should
bread
unless
for
good
reason
shown
until
he
or
she
had
been
baptized
that
is
to
say
totally
immersed
in
solemn
conclave
by
the
ministering
brother
this
rite
used
in
our
earliest
days
to
be
performed
with
picturesque
simplicity
in
the
sea
on
the
oddicombe
beach
but
to
this
there
were
even
in
those
quiet
years
extreme
objections
a
jeering
crowd
could
scarcely
be
avoided
and
women
in
particular
shrank
from
the
ordeal
this
used
to
be
a
practical
difficulty
and
my
father
when
communicants
confessed
that
they
had
not
yet
been
baptized
would
shake
his
head
and
say
gravely
ah
you
shun
the
cross
of
christ
but
that
baptism
in
the
sea
on
the
open
beach
a
he
would
not
deny
and
when
we
built
our
own
little
chapel
a
sort
of
font
planked
over
was
arranged
in
the
room
itself
among
these
quiet
taciturn
people
there
were
several
whom
i
recall
with
affection
in
this
remote
corner
of
devonshire
on
the
road
nowhither
they
had
preserved
much
of
the
air
of
that
eighteenth
century
which
the
elders
among
them
perfectly
remembered
there
was
one
old
man
born
before
the
french
revolution
whose
figure
often
recurs
to
me
this
was
james
petherbridge
the
nestor
of
our
meeting
extremely
tall
and
attenuated
he
came
on
sundays
in
a
full
white
smockfrock
smartly
embroidered
down
the
front
and
when
he
settled
himself
to
listen
he
would
raise
this
smock
like
a
skirt
and
reveal
a
pair
of
immensely
long
thin
legs
cased
in
tight
leggings
and
ending
in
shoes
with
buckles
as
the
sacred
message
fell
from
my
father
lips
the
lantern
jaws
of
petherbridge
slowly
fell
apart
while
his
knees
sloped
to
so
immense
a
distance
from
one
another
that
it
seemed
as
though
they
never
could
meet
again
he
had
been
pious
all
his
life
and
he
would
tell
us
in
some
modest
pride
that
when
he
was
a
lad
the
farmer
wife
who
was
his
mistress
used
to
say
think
our
jem
is
going
to
be
a
methody
he
do
so
hanker
after
godly
discoursings
petherbridge
was
accustomed
to
pray
orally
at
our
in
a
funny
old
voice
like
wind
in
a
hollow
tree
and
he
seldom
failed
to
express
a
hope
that
lord
would
support
miss
lafroy
who
was
the
village
schoolmistress
and
one
of
our
congregation
her
labour
of
teaching
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
i
not
understanding
this
literary
allusion
long
believed
the
school
to
be
addicted
to
some
species
of
the
key
of
the
room
was
kept
by
richard
moxhay
the
mason
who
was
of
a
generation
younger
than
petherbridge
but
yet
on
in
years
moxhay
i
can
not
tell
why
was
always
dressed
in
white
corduroy
on
which
any
stain
of
devonshire
scarlet
mud
was
painfully
conspicuous
when
he
was
smartened
up
his
appearance
suggested
that
somebody
had
given
him
a
coating
of
that
rich
western
whitewash
which
looks
like
devonshire
cream
his
locks
were
long
and
sparse
and
as
deadly
black
as
his
clothes
were
white
he
was
a
modest
gentle
man
with
a
wife
even
more
meek
and
gracious
than
himself
they
never
to
my
recollection
spoke
unless
they
were
spoken
to
and
their
melancholy
impassiveness
used
to
vex
my
father
who
once
referring
to
the
moxhays
described
them
sententiously
but
justly
as
being
but
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
happy
christians
indeed
my
memory
pictures
almost
all
the
of
that
early
time
as
sad
and
humble
souls
lacking
vitality
yet
not
complaining
of
anything
definite
a
quite
surprising
number
of
them
it
is
true
male
and
female
suffered
from
different
forms
of
consumption
so
that
the
room
rang
in
winter
evenings
with
a
discord
of
hacking
coughs
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
was
quite
young
half
the
inhabitants
of
our
rural
district
were
affected
with
phthisis
no
doubt
our
peculiar
religious
community
was
more
likely
to
attract
the
feeble
members
of
a
population
than
to
tempt
the
flush
and
the
fair
miss
marks
patient
pilgrim
that
she
was
accepted
this
quaint
society
without
a
murmur
although
i
do
not
think
it
was
much
to
her
taste
but
in
a
very
short
time
it
was
sweetened
to
her
by
the
formation
of
a
devoted
and
romantic
friendship
for
one
of
the
who
was
indeed
if
my
childish
recollection
does
not
fail
me
a
very
charming
person
the
consequence
of
this
enthusiastic
alliance
was
that
i
was
carried
into
the
bosom
of
the
family
to
which
miss
marks
new
friend
belonged
and
of
these
excellent
people
i
must
give
what
picture
i
can
almost
opposite
the
room
therefore
at
the
far
end
of
the
village
across
one
of
the
rare
small
gardens
in
which
this
first
winter
i
discovered
with
rapture
the
magenta
stars
of
a
new
flower
hepatica
a
displayed
a
thin
row
of
plates
and
dishes
cups
and
saucers
above
it
was
painted
the
name
of
burmington
this
was
the
property
of
three
orphan
sisters
ann
mary
grace
and
bess
the
latter
lately
married
to
a
carpenter
who
was
at
our
meeting
the
other
two
resolute
old
maids
ann
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
had
been
one
of
the
girls
converted
by
the
cornish
fishermen
she
was
about
ten
years
older
than
bess
and
mary
grace
came
halfway
between
them
ann
was
a
very
worthy
woman
but
masterful
and
passionate
suffering
from
an
ungovernable
temper
which
at
calmer
moments
she
used
to
refer
to
not
without
complacency
as
sin
which
doth
most
easily
beset
me
bess
was
insignificant
and
vulgarized
by
domestic
cares
but
mary
grace
was
a
delightful
creature
the
burmingtons
lived
in
what
was
almost
the
only
old
house
surviving
in
the
village
it
was
an
extraordinary
construction
of
two
storeys
with
vast
rooms
and
winding
passages
and
surprising
changes
of
level
the
sisters
were
poor
but
very
industrious
and
never
in
anything
like
want
they
sold
as
i
have
said
crockery
and
they
took
in
washing
and
did
a
little
fine
needlework
and
sold
the
produce
of
a
great
vague
garden
at
the
back
in
process
of
time
the
elder
sisters
took
a
young
woman
whose
name
was
drusilla
elliott
to
live
with
them
as
servant
and
companion
she
was
a
converted
person
worshipping
with
a
kindred
sect
the
bible
christians
i
remember
being
much
interested
in
hearing
how
bess
before
her
marriage
became
converted
mary
grace
on
account
of
her
infirm
health
slept
alone
in
one
room
in
another
of
vast
size
stood
a
family
fourposter
where
ann
slept
with
drusilla
elliott
and
another
bed
in
the
same
room
took
bess
the
sisters
and
their
friend
had
been
constantly
praying
that
bess
might
peace
for
she
was
still
a
stranger
to
salvation
one
night
she
suddenly
called
out
rather
crossly
are
you
two
whispering
about
do
go
to
sleep
to
which
ann
replied
are
praying
for
you
do
you
know
answered
bess
i
do
believe
and
then
she
told
them
that
that
very
night
when
she
was
sitting
in
the
shop
she
had
closed
with
god
offer
of
redemption
late
in
the
night
as
it
was
ann
and
drusilla
could
do
no
less
than
go
in
and
waken
mary
grace
whom
however
they
found
awake
praying
she
too
for
the
conversion
of
bess
they
told
her
the
good
news
and
all
four
kneeling
in
the
darkness
gave
thanks
aloud
to
god
for
his
infinite
mercy
it
was
mary
grace
burmington
who
now
became
the
romantic
friend
of
miss
marks
and
a
sort
of
second
benevolence
to
me
she
must
have
been
under
thirty
years
of
age
she
wax
very
small
and
she
was
distressingly
deformed
in
the
spine
but
she
had
an
animated
almost
a
sparkling
countenance
when
we
first
arrived
in
the
village
mary
grace
was
only
just
recovering
from
a
gastric
fever
which
had
taken
her
close
to
the
grave
i
remember
hearing
that
the
vicar
a
stout
and
pompous
man
at
whom
we
always
glared
defiance
went
in
mary
grace
supposed
extremity
to
the
burmingtons
and
shouted
be
to
this
house
intending
to
offer
his
ministrations
but
that
ann
who
was
in
one
of
her
tantrums
positively
hounded
him
from
the
doorstep
and
down
the
garden
in
her
passionate
nonconformity
mary
grace
however
recovered
and
soon
became
not
merely
miss
inseparable
friend
but
my
father
spiritual
factotum
he
found
it
irksome
to
visit
the
from
house
to
house
and
mary
grace
burmington
gladly
assumed
this
labour
she
proved
a
most
efficient
coadjutor
searched
out
cherished
and
confirmed
any
of
those
especially
the
young
who
were
attracted
by
my
preaching
and
for
several
years
was
a
great
joy
and
comfort
to
us
all
even
when
her
illness
so
increased
that
she
could
no
longer
rise
from
her
bed
she
was
a
centre
of
usefulness
and
cheerfulness
from
that
retreat
where
she
in
a
kind
of
rustic
state
under
a
patchwork
coverlid
that
was
like
a
basket
of
flowers
my
father
ever
reflecting
on
what
could
be
done
to
confirm
my
spiritual
vocation
to
pin
me
down
as
it
were
beyond
any
possibility
of
escape
bethought
him
that
it
would
accustom
me
to
what
he
called
work
in
the
lord
service
if
i
accompanied
mary
grace
on
her
visits
from
house
to
house
if
it
is
remembered
that
i
was
only
eight
and
a
half
when
this
scheme
was
carried
into
practice
it
will
surprise
no
one
to
hear
that
it
was
not
crowned
with
success
i
disliked
extremely
this
visitation
of
the
poor
i
felt
shy
i
had
nothing
to
say
with
difficulty
could
i
understand
their
soft
devonian
patois
and
most
of
all
a
signal
perhaps
of
my
neurotic
condition
i
dreaded
and
loathed
the
smells
of
their
cottages
one
had
to
run
over
the
whole
gamut
of
odours
some
so
faint
that
they
embraced
the
nostril
with
a
fairy
kiss
others
bluntly
gross
of
the
order
some
sweet
with
a
dreadful
sourness
some
bitter
with
a
smack
of
rancid
there
were
fine
manly
smells
of
the
pigsty
and
the
open
drain
and
these
prided
themselves
on
being
all
they
seemed
to
be
but
there
were
also
feminine
odours
masquerading
as
you
knew
not
what
in
which
penny
whiffs
vials
of
balm
and
opoponax
seemed
to
have
become
tainted
vaguely
with
the
residue
of
the
it
was
not
i
think
that
the
villagers
were
particularly
dirty
but
those
were
days
before
the
invention
of
sanitary
science
and
my
poor
young
nose
was
morbidly
nay
ridiculously
sensitive
i
often
came
home
from
the
saints
absolutely
incapable
of
eating
the
with
brown
sugar
strewn
over
it
which
was
my
evening
meal
there
was
one
exception
to
my
unwillingness
to
join
in
the
pastoral
labours
of
mary
grace
when
she
announced
on
a
fine
afternoon
that
we
were
going
to
pavor
and
barton
i
was
always
agog
to
start
these
were
two
hamlets
in
our
parish
and
i
should
suppose
the
original
home
of
its
population
pavor
was
even
then
decayed
almost
to
extinction
but
barton
preserved
its
desultory
street
of
ancient
detached
cottages
each
however
poor
had
a
wild
garden
around
it
and
where
the
inhabitants
possessed
some
pride
in
their
surroundings
the
roses
and
the
jasmines
and
that
distinguished
creeper
which
one
sees
nowhere
at
its
best
but
in
devonshire
the
stately
cotoneaster
made
the
whole
place
a
bower
barton
was
in
vivid
contrast
to
our
own
harsh
open
squalid
village
with
its
mean
modern
houses
its
absence
of
all
vegetation
the
ancient
thatched
cottages
of
barton
were
shut
in
by
moist
hills
and
canopied
by
ancient
trees
they
were
approached
along
a
deep
lane
which
was
all
a
wonder
and
a
revelation
to
me
that
spring
since
in
the
very
words
of
shelley
there
in
the
warm
hedge
grew
lush
eglantine
green
and
the
may
and
cherry
blossoms
and
white
cups
whose
wine
was
the
bright
dew
yet
drained
not
by
the
day
and
wild
roses
and
ivy
serpentine
with
its
dark
buds
and
leaves
wandering
astray
around
and
beyond
barton
there
lay
fairyland
all
was
mysterious
unexplored
rich
with
infinite
possibilities
i
should
one
day
enter
it
the
sword
of
in
my
hand
the
cap
of
courage
on
my
head
you
are
a
big
boy
said
the
oracle
of
mary
grace
for
the
present
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
being
an
unadventurous
couple
a
little
woman
bent
and
a
preternaturally
sedate
small
boy
as
we
walked
very
slowly
side
by
side
conversing
on
terms
of
high
familiarity
in
which
biblical
and
colloquial
phrases
were
quaintly
jumbled
through
the
sticky
red
mud
of
the
pavor
lanes
with
barton
as
a
bourne
before
us
when
we
came
home
my
father
would
sometimes
ask
me
for
particulars
where
had
we
been
whom
had
we
found
at
home
what
testimony
had
those
visited
been
able
to
give
of
the
goodness
to
them
what
had
mary
grace
replied
in
the
way
of
exhortation
reproof
or
condolence
these
questions
i
hated
at
the
time
but
they
were
very
useful
to
me
since
they
gave
me
the
habit
of
concentrating
my
attention
on
what
was
going
on
in
the
course
of
our
visits
in
case
i
might
be
called
upon
to
give
a
report
my
father
was
very
kind
in
the
matter
he
cultivated
my
powers
of
expression
he
did
not
snub
me
when
i
failed
to
be
intelligent
but
i
overheard
miss
marks
and
mary
grace
discussing
the
whole
question
under
the
guise
of
referring
to
know
whom
not
a
hundred
miles
hence
fancying
that
i
could
not
recognize
their
little
ostrich
because
its
head
was
in
a
bag
of
metaphor
i
understood
perfectly
and
gathered
that
they
both
of
them
thought
this
business
of
my
going
into
undrained
cottages
injudicious
accordingly
i
was
by
degrees
taken
only
when
mary
grace
was
going
into
the
and
then
i
was
usually
left
outside
to
skip
among
the
flowers
and
stalk
the
butterflies
i
must
not
however
underestimate
the
very
prominent
part
taken
all
through
this
spring
and
summer
of
by
the
collection
of
specimens
on
the
seashore
my
father
had
returned
the
chagrin
of
his
failure
in
theorizing
now
being
mitigated
to
what
was
his
real
work
in
life
the
practical
study
of
animal
forms
in
detail
he
was
not
a
biologist
in
the
true
sense
of
the
term
that
luminous
indication
which
flaubert
gives
of
what
the
action
of
the
scientific
mind
should
be
esprit
et
pesant
les
mondes
sans
haine
sans
peur
sans
pitie
sans
amour
et
sans
was
opposed
in
every
segment
to
the
attitude
of
my
father
who
nevertheless
was
a
man
of
very
high
scientific
attainment
but
again
i
repeat
he
was
not
a
philosopher
he
was
incapable
by
temperament
and
education
of
forming
broad
generalizations
and
of
escaping
in
a
vast
survey
from
the
troublesome
pettiness
of
detail
he
saw
everything
through
a
lens
nothing
in
the
immensity
of
nature
certain
senses
were
absent
in
him
i
think
that
with
all
his
justice
he
had
no
conception
of
the
importance
of
liberty
with
all
his
intelligence
the
boundaries
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
his
mind
could
think
at
all
were
always
close
about
him
with
all
his
faith
in
the
word
of
god
he
had
no
confidence
in
the
divine
benevolence
and
with
all
his
passionate
piety
he
habitually
mistook
fear
for
love
it
was
down
on
the
shore
tramping
along
the
pebbled
terraces
of
the
beach
clambering
over
the
great
blocks
of
fallen
conglomerate
which
broke
the
white
curve
with
rufous
promontories
that
jutted
into
the
sea
or
finally
bending
over
those
shallow
tidal
pools
in
the
limestone
rocks
which
were
our
proper
ground
it
was
in
such
circumstances
as
these
that
my
father
became
most
easy
most
happy
most
human
that
hard
look
across
his
brows
which
it
wearied
me
to
see
the
look
that
came
from
sleepless
anxiety
of
conscience
faded
away
and
left
the
dark
countenance
still
always
stern
indeed
but
serene
and
unupbraiding
those
pools
were
our
mirrors
in
which
reflected
in
the
dark
hyaline
and
framed
by
the
sleek
and
shining
fronds
of
there
used
to
appear
the
shapes
of
a
man
and
a
funny
little
boy
equally
eager
and
i
almost
find
the
presumption
to
say
equally
well
prepared
fog
business
if
anyone
goes
down
to
those
shores
now
if
man
or
boy
seeks
to
follow
in
our
traces
let
him
realize
at
once
before
he
takes
the
trouble
to
roll
up
his
sleeves
that
his
zeal
will
end
in
labour
lost
there
is
nothing
now
where
in
our
days
there
was
so
much
then
the
rocks
between
tide
and
tide
were
submarine
gardens
of
a
beauty
that
seemed
often
to
be
fabulous
and
was
positively
delusive
since
if
we
delicately
lifted
the
weedcurtains
of
a
windless
pool
though
we
might
for
a
moment
see
its
sides
and
floor
paven
with
living
blossoms
grange
and
amethyst
yet
all
that
panoply
would
melt
away
furled
into
the
hollow
rock
if
we
so
much
as
dropped
a
pebble
in
to
disturb
the
magic
dream
half
a
century
ago
in
many
parts
of
the
coast
of
devonshire
and
cornwall
where
the
limestone
at
the
water
edge
is
wrought
into
crevices
and
hollows
the
tideline
was
like
keats
grecian
vase
still
unravished
bride
of
quietness
these
cups
and
basins
were
always
full
whether
the
tide
was
high
or
low
and
the
only
way
in
which
they
were
affected
was
that
twice
in
the
hours
they
were
replenished
by
cold
streams
from
the
great
sea
and
then
twice
were
left
brimming
to
be
vivified
by
the
temperate
movement
of
the
upper
air
they
were
living
so
exquisite
in
their
perfection
that
my
father
in
spite
of
his
scientific
requirements
used
not
seldom
to
pause
before
he
began
to
rifle
them
ejaculating
that
it
was
indeed
a
pity
to
disturb
such
congregated
beauty
the
antiquity
of
these
and
the
infinite
succession
of
the
soft
and
radiant
forms
anemones
seaweeds
shells
fishes
which
had
inhabited
them
undisturbed
since
the
creation
of
the
world
used
to
occupy
my
father
fancy
we
burst
in
he
used
to
say
where
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
intruding
before
and
if
the
garden
of
eden
had
been
situate
in
devonshire
adam
and
eve
stepping
lightly
down
to
bathe
in
the
spray
would
have
seen
the
identical
sights
that
we
now
saw
the
great
prawns
gliding
like
transparent
launches
anthea
waving
in
the
twilight
its
thick
white
waxen
tentacles
and
the
fronds
of
the
duke
faintly
streaming
on
the
water
like
huge
red
banners
in
some
reverted
atmosphere
all
this
is
long
over
and
done
with
the
ring
of
living
beauty
drawn
about
our
shores
was
a
very
thin
and
fragile
one
it
had
existed
all
those
centuries
solely
in
consequence
of
the
indifference
the
blissful
ignorance
of
man
these
rockbasins
fringed
by
corallines
filled
with
still
water
almost
as
pellucid
as
the
upper
air
itself
thronged
with
beautiful
sensitive
forms
of
life
they
exist
no
longer
they
are
all
profaned
and
emptied
and
vulgarized
an
army
of
has
passed
over
them
and
ravaged
every
corner
of
them
the
fairy
paradise
has
been
violated
the
exquisite
product
of
centuries
of
natural
selection
has
been
crushed
under
the
rough
paw
of
curiosity
that
my
father
himself
so
reverent
so
conservative
had
by
the
popularity
of
his
books
acquired
the
direct
responsibility
for
a
calamity
that
he
had
never
anticipated
became
clear
enough
to
himself
before
many
years
had
passed
and
cost
him
great
chagrin
no
one
will
see
again
on
the
shore
of
england
what
i
saw
in
my
early
childhood
the
submarine
vision
of
dark
rocks
speckled
and
starred
with
an
infinite
variety
of
colour
and
streamed
over
by
silken
flags
of
royal
crimson
and
purple
in
reviving
these
impressions
i
am
unable
to
give
any
exact
chronological
sequence
to
them
these
particular
adventures
began
early
in
they
reached
their
greatest
intensity
in
the
summer
of
and
they
did
not
altogether
cease
so
far
as
my
father
was
concerned
until
nearly
twenty
years
later
but
it
was
while
he
was
composing
what
as
i
am
told
by
scientific
men
of
today
continues
to
be
his
most
valuable
contribution
to
knowledge
his
of
the
british
and
that
we
worked
together
on
the
shore
for
a
definite
purpose
and
the
last
instalment
of
that
volume
was
ready
for
press
by
the
close
of
the
way
in
which
my
father
worked
in
his
most
desperate
escapades
was
to
wade
into
one
of
the
huge
pools
and
examine
the
surface
of
the
rock
above
and
below
the
brim
in
such
remote
places
spots
where
i
could
never
venture
being
left
a
slightly
timorous
andromeda
chained
to
a
safer
level
of
the
cliff
in
these
extreme
basins
there
used
often
to
lurk
a
marvellous
profusion
of
animal
and
vegetable
forms
my
father
would
search
for
the
roughest
and
most
corroded
points
of
rock
those
offering
the
best
refuge
for
a
variety
of
creatures
and
would
then
chisel
off
fragments
as
low
down
in
the
water
as
he
could
these
pieces
of
rock
were
instantly
plunged
in
the
saltwater
of
jars
which
we
had
brought
with
us
for
the
purpose
when
as
much
had
been
collected
as
we
could
carry
away
my
father
always
dragged
about
an
immense
square
basket
the
creak
of
whose
handles
i
can
still
fancy
that
i
hear
we
turned
to
trudge
up
the
long
climb
home
then
all
our
prizes
were
spread
out
face
upward
in
shallow
pans
of
clean
in
a
few
hours
when
all
dirt
had
subsided
and
what
living
creatures
we
had
brought
seemed
to
have
recovered
their
composure
my
work
began
my
eyes
were
extremely
keen
and
powerful
though
they
were
vexatiously
of
no
use
in
examining
objects
at
any
distance
in
investigating
a
minute
surface
my
vision
was
trained
to
be
invaluable
the
shallow
pan
with
our
spoils
would
rest
on
a
table
near
the
window
and
i
kneeling
on
a
chair
opposite
the
light
would
lean
over
the
surface
until
everything
was
within
an
inch
or
two
of
my
eyes
often
i
bent
in
my
zeal
so
far
forward
that
the
water
touched
the
tip
of
my
nose
and
gave
me
a
little
icy
shock
in
this
attitude
an
idle
spectator
might
have
formed
the
impression
that
i
was
trying
to
wash
my
head
and
could
not
quite
summon
up
resolution
enough
to
plunge
in
this
odd
pose
i
would
remain
for
a
long
time
holding
my
breath
and
examining
with
extreme
care
every
atom
of
rock
every
swirl
of
detritus
this
was
a
task
which
my
father
could
only
perform
by
the
help
of
a
lens
with
which
of
course
he
took
care
to
supplement
my
examination
but
that
my
survey
was
of
use
he
has
himself
most
handsomely
testified
in
his
where
he
expresses
his
debt
to
the
and
eye
of
my
little
son
nor
if
boasting
is
not
to
be
excluded
is
it
every
eminent
biologist
every
proud
and
masterful
who
can
lay
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
swear
that
before
reaching
the
age
of
ten
years
he
had
added
not
merely
a
new
species
but
a
new
genus
to
the
british
fauna
that
however
the
author
of
these
pages
can
do
who
on
june
discovered
a
tiny
atom
and
ran
in
the
greatest
agitation
to
announce
the
discovery
of
that
object
a
form
with
which
he
was
unacquainted
which
figures
since
then
on
all
lists
of
as
phellia
murocincta
or
the
walled
corklet
alas
that
so
fair
a
swallow
should
have
made
no
biological
summer
in
these
delicious
agitations
by
the
edge
of
the
wave
must
have
greatly
improved
my
health
which
however
was
still
looked
upon
as
fragile
i
was
loaded
with
coats
and
comforters
and
strolled
out
between
miss
marks
and
mary
grace
burmington
a
muffled
ball
of
flannel
this
alone
was
enough
to
give
me
a
look
of
delicacy
which
the
in
their
blunt
way
made
no
scruple
of
commenting
upon
to
my
face
i
was
greatly
impressed
by
a
conversation
held
over
my
bed
one
evening
by
the
servants
our
cook
susan
a
person
of
enormous
size
and
kate
the
tattling
tiresome
who
waited
upon
us
on
the
summer
evening
i
speak
of
were
standing
i
can
not
tell
why
on
each
side
of
my
bed
i
shut
my
eyes
and
lay
quite
still
in
order
to
escape
conversing
with
them
and
they
spoke
to
one
another
poor
lamb
kate
said
trivially
not
long
for
this
world
going
home
to
jesus
he
is
in
a
jiffy
i
should
say
by
the
look
of
but
susan
answered
so
i
dreamed
about
and
i
know
for
sure
that
he
is
to
be
spared
for
missionary
service
service
repeated
kate
impressed
susan
went
on
with
solemn
emphasis
bleed
for
his
lord
in
heathen
parts
that
what
the
future
have
in
store
for
when
they
were
gone
i
beat
upon
the
coverlid
with
my
fists
and
i
determined
that
whatever
happened
i
would
not
not
go
out
to
preach
the
gospel
among
horrid
tropical
niggers
chapter
vii
in
the
history
of
an
infancy
so
cloistered
and
uniform
as
mine
such
a
real
adventure
as
my
being
publicly
and
successfully
kidnapped
can
not
be
overlooked
there
were
several
in
our
village
harmless
eccentrics
who
had
more
or
less
unquestionably
crossed
the
barrier
which
divides
the
sane
from
the
insane
they
were
not
discouraged
by
public
opinion
indeed
several
of
them
were
favoured
beings
suspected
by
my
father
of
exaggerating
their
mental
density
in
order
to
escape
having
to
work
like
dogs
who
as
we
all
know
could
speak
as
well
as
we
do
were
they
not
afraid
of
being
made
to
fetch
and
carry
miss
mary
flaw
was
not
one
of
these
imbeciles
she
was
what
the
french
call
a
she
had
enjoyed
good
intelligence
and
an
active
mind
but
her
wits
had
left
the
rails
and
were
careening
about
the
country
miss
flaw
was
the
daughter
of
a
retired
baptist
minister
and
she
lived
with
i
remember
not
what
relations
in
a
little
solitary
house
high
up
at
barton
cross
whither
mary
grace
and
i
would
sometimes
struggle
when
our
pastoral
duties
were
over
in
later
years
when
i
met
with
those
celebrated
verses
in
which
the
philosopher
expresses
the
hope
in
the
downhill
of
life
when
i
find
i
declining
may
my
lot
no
less
fortunate
be
than
a
snug
can
afford
for
reclining
and
a
cot
that
the
wide
sea
my
thoughts
returned
instinctively
and
they
still
return
to
the
high
abode
of
miss
flaw
there
was
a
porch
at
her
door
both
for
shelter
and
shade
and
it
was
covered
with
jasmine
but
the
charm
of
the
place
was
a
close
by
containing
a
table
encrusted
with
and
seats
from
which
one
saw
the
distant
waters
of
the
bay
at
the
entrance
to
this
grotto
there
was
always
set
a
destined
i
suppose
for
the
rev
flaw
or
else
left
there
in
pious
memory
of
him
since
i
can
not
recollect
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
i
delighted
in
these
visits
to
mary
flaw
she
always
received
us
with
effusion
tripping
forward
to
meet
us
and
leading
us
each
by
a
hand
held
high
with
a
dancing
movement
which
i
thought
infinitely
graceful
to
the
bower
where
she
would
regale
us
with
devonshire
cream
and
with
small
hard
biscuits
that
were
like
pebbles
the
conversation
of
mary
flaw
was
a
great
treat
to
me
i
enjoyed
its
irregularities
its
waywardness
it
was
like
a
tune
that
wandered
into
several
keys
as
mary
grace
burmington
put
it
one
never
knew
what
dear
mary
flaw
would
say
next
and
that
she
did
not
herself
know
added
to
the
charm
she
had
become
crazed
poor
thing
in
consequence
of
a
disappointment
in
love
but
of
course
i
did
not
know
that
nor
that
she
was
crazed
at
all
i
thought
her
brilliant
and
original
and
i
liked
her
very
much
in
the
light
of
coming
events
it
would
be
affectation
were
i
to
pretend
that
she
did
not
feel
a
similar
partiality
for
me
miss
flaw
was
from
the
first
devoted
to
my
ministrations
and
it
was
part
of
our
odd
village
indulgence
that
no
one
ever
dreamed
of
preventing
her
from
coming
to
the
room
on
sunday
evenings
the
bulk
of
the
audience
was
arranged
on
forms
with
backs
to
them
set
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
a
passage
round
them
while
other
forms
were
placed
against
the
walls
my
father
preached
from
a
lectern
facing
the
audience
if
darkness
came
on
in
the
course
of
the
service
richard
moxhay
glimmering
in
his
corduroys
used
to
go
slowly
around
lighting
groups
of
tallow
candles
by
the
help
of
a
box
of
lucifers
mary
flaw
always
assumed
the
place
of
honour
on
the
left
extremity
of
the
front
bench
immediately
opposite
my
father
miss
marks
and
mary
grace
with
me
ensconced
and
almost
buried
between
them
occupied
the
right
of
the
same
bench
while
the
lighting
proceeded
miss
flaw
used
to
direct
it
from
her
seat
silently
by
pointing
out
to
moxhay
who
took
no
notice
what
groups
of
candles
he
should
light
next
she
did
this
just
as
the
clown
in
the
circus
directs
the
grooms
how
to
move
the
furniture
and
moxhay
paid
no
more
attention
to
her
than
the
grooms
do
to
the
clown
miss
flaw
had
another
peculiarity
she
silently
went
through
a
service
exactly
similar
to
ours
but
much
briefer
the
course
of
our
evening
service
was
this
my
father
prayed
and
we
all
knelt
down
then
he
gave
out
a
hymn
and
most
of
us
stood
up
to
sing
then
he
preached
for
about
an
hour
while
we
sat
and
listened
then
a
hymn
again
then
prayer
and
the
valediction
mary
flaw
went
through
this
ritual
but
on
a
smaller
scale
we
all
knelt
down
together
but
when
we
rose
from
our
knees
miss
flaw
was
already
standing
up
and
was
pretending
without
a
sound
to
sing
a
hymn
in
the
midst
of
our
hymn
she
sat
down
opened
her
bible
found
a
text
and
then
leaned
back
her
eyes
fixed
in
space
listening
to
an
imaginary
sermon
which
our
own
real
one
soon
caught
up
and
coincided
with
for
about
quarters
of
an
hour
then
while
our
sermon
went
peacefully
on
miss
flaw
would
rise
and
sing
in
silence
if
i
am
permitted
to
use
such
an
expression
her
own
visionary
hymn
then
she
would
kneel
down
and
pray
then
rise
collect
her
belongings
and
sweep
in
fairy
majesty
out
of
the
chapel
my
father
still
rounding
his
periods
from
the
pulpit
nobody
ever
thought
of
preventing
these
movements
or
of
checking
the
poor
creature
in
her
innocent
flightiness
until
the
evening
of
the
great
event
it
was
all
my
own
fault
mary
flaw
had
finished
her
imaginary
service
earlier
than
usual
she
had
stood
up
alone
with
her
book
before
her
she
had
flung
herself
on
her
knees
alone
in
the
attitude
of
devotion
she
had
risen
she
had
seated
herself
for
a
moment
to
put
on
her
gloves
and
to
collect
her
bible
her
book
and
her
in
her
reticule
she
was
ready
to
start
and
she
looked
around
her
with
a
pleasant
air
my
father
all
undisturbed
booming
away
meanwhile
over
our
heads
i
know
not
why
the
manoeuvres
of
miss
flaw
especially
attracted
me
that
evening
but
i
leaned
out
across
miss
marks
and
i
caught
miss
flaw
eye
she
nodded
i
nodded
and
the
amazing
deed
was
done
i
hardly
know
how
miss
flaw
with
incredible
swiftness
flew
along
the
line
plucked
me
by
the
from
between
my
paralysed
protectresses
darted
with
me
down
the
chapel
and
out
into
the
dark
before
anyone
had
time
to
say
robinson
my
father
gazed
from
the
pulpit
and
the
stream
of
exhortation
withered
on
his
lips
no
one
in
the
body
of
the
audience
stirred
no
one
but
himself
had
clearly
seen
what
had
happened
vague
rows
of
with
gaping
countenances
stared
up
at
him
while
he
shouted
nobody
stop
them
as
we
whisked
out
through
the
doorway
forth
into
the
moist
night
we
went
and
up
the
lampless
village
where
a
few
minutes
later
the
swiftest
of
the
congregation
with
my
father
at
their
head
found
us
sitting
on
the
doorstep
of
the
butcher
shop
my
captor
was
now
quite
quiet
and
made
no
objection
to
my
quitting
her
a
single
kiss
or
a
goodbye
as
the
poet
says
although
i
had
scarcely
felt
frightened
at
the
time
doubtless
my
nerves
were
shaken
by
this
escapade
and
it
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
recurrence
of
the
distressing
visions
from
which
i
had
suffered
as
a
very
little
child
these
came
back
with
a
force
and
expansion
due
to
my
increased
maturity
i
had
hardly
laid
my
head
down
on
the
pillow
than
as
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
taking
part
in
a
mad
gallop
through
space
some
force
which
had
tight
hold
of
me
so
that
i
felt
myself
an
atom
in
its
grasp
was
hurrying
me
on
over
an
endless
slender
bridge
under
which
on
either
side
a
loud
torrent
rushed
at
a
vertiginous
depth
below
at
first
our
helpless
flight
for
i
was
bound
hand
and
foot
like
mazeppa
proceeded
in
a
straight
line
but
presently
it
began
to
curve
and
we
raced
and
roared
along
in
what
gradually
became
a
monstrous
vortex
reverberant
with
noises
loud
with
light
while
as
we
proceeded
enormous
concentric
circles
engulfed
us
and
wheeled
above
and
about
us
it
seemed
as
if
we
i
that
is
and
the
undefined
force
which
carried
me
were
pushing
feverishly
on
towards
a
goal
which
our
whole
concentrated
energies
were
bent
on
reaching
but
which
a
frenzied
despair
in
my
heart
told
me
we
never
could
reach
yet
the
attainment
of
which
alone
could
save
us
from
destruction
far
away
in
the
pulsation
of
the
great
luminous
whorls
i
could
just
see
that
goal
a
point
waxing
and
waning
and
it
bore
or
to
be
exact
it
consisted
of
the
letters
of
the
word
carmine
this
agitating
vision
recurred
night
after
night
and
filled
me
with
inexpressible
distress
the
details
of
it
altered
very
little
and
i
knew
what
i
had
to
expect
when
i
crept
into
bed
i
knew
that
for
a
few
minutes
i
should
be
battling
with
the
chill
of
the
linen
sheets
and
trying
to
keep
awake
but
that
then
without
a
pause
i
should
slip
into
that
terrible
realm
of
storm
and
stress
in
which
i
was
bound
hand
and
foot
and
sent
galloping
through
infinity
often
have
i
wakened
with
unutterable
joy
to
find
my
father
and
miss
marks
whom
my
screams
had
disturbed
standing
one
on
each
side
of
my
bed
they
could
release
me
from
my
nightmare
which
seldom
assailed
me
twice
a
night
but
how
to
preserve
me
from
its
original
attack
passed
their
understanding
my
father
in
his
tenderness
thought
to
exorcize
the
demon
by
prayer
he
would
appear
in
the
bedroom
just
as
i
was
first
slipping
into
bed
and
he
would
kneel
at
my
side
the
light
from
a
candle
on
the
streamed
down
upon
his
dark
head
of
hair
while
his
face
was
buried
in
the
coverlid
from
which
a
loud
voice
came
up
a
little
muffled
begging
that
i
might
be
preserved
against
all
the
evil
spirits
that
walk
in
darkness
and
that
the
deep
might
not
swallow
me
up
this
little
ceremony
gave
a
distraction
to
my
thoughts
and
may
have
been
useful
in
that
way
but
it
led
to
an
unfortunate
circumstance
my
father
began
to
enjoy
these
orisons
at
my
bedside
and
to
prolong
them
perhaps
they
lasted
a
little
too
long
but
i
contrived
to
keep
awake
through
them
sometimes
by
a
great
effort
on
one
unhappy
night
however
i
gave
even
worse
offense
than
slumber
would
have
given
my
father
was
praying
aloud
in
the
attitude
i
have
described
and
i
was
half
sitting
half
lying
in
bed
with
the
clothes
sloping
from
my
chin
suddenly
a
rather
large
insect
dark
and
flat
with
more
legs
than
a
insect
ought
to
need
appeared
at
the
bottom
of
the
counterpane
and
slowly
advanced
i
think
it
was
nothing
worse
than
a
beetle
it
walked
successfully
past
my
father
sleek
black
ball
of
a
head
and
climbed
straight
up
at
me
nearer
nearer
until
it
seemed
all
a
twinkle
of
horns
and
joints
i
bore
it
in
silent
fascination
until
it
almost
tickled
my
chin
and
then
i
screamed
papa
my
father
rose
in
great
dudgeon
removed
the
insect
what
were
insects
to
him
and
then
gave
me
a
tremendous
lecture
the
sense
of
desperation
which
this
incident
produced
i
shall
not
easily
forget
life
seemed
really
to
be
very
harassing
when
to
visions
within
and
beetles
without
there
was
joined
the
consciousness
of
having
grievously
offended
god
by
an
act
of
disrespect
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
justify
to
myself
the
violent
jobation
which
my
father
gave
me
in
consequence
of
my
scream
except
by
attributing
to
him
something
of
the
human
weakness
of
vanity
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
he
liked
to
hear
himself
speak
to
god
in
the
presence
of
an
admiring
listener
he
prayed
with
fervour
and
animation
in
pure
johnsonian
english
and
i
hope
i
am
not
undutiful
if
i
add
my
impression
that
he
was
not
displeased
with
the
sound
of
his
own
devotions
my
cry
for
help
had
needlessly
as
he
thought
broken
in
upon
this
holy
and
seemly
performance
the
child
of
a
naturalist
he
remarked
in
awesome
tones
to
pretend
to
feel
terror
at
the
advance
of
an
insect
it
could
but
be
a
pretext
he
declared
for
avoiding
the
testimony
of
faith
in
prayer
your
heart
were
fixed
if
it
panted
after
the
lord
it
would
take
more
than
the
movements
of
a
beetle
to
make
you
disturb
oral
supplication
at
his
footstool
beware
for
god
is
a
jealous
god
and
he
consumes
them
in
wrath
who
make
a
noise
like
a
dog
my
father
took
at
all
times
a
singular
pleasure
in
repeating
that
god
is
a
jealous
god
he
liked
the
word
which
i
suppose
he
used
in
an
antiquated
sense
he
was
accustomed
to
tell
the
at
the
room
in
a
very
genial
manner
and
smiling
at
them
as
he
said
it
am
jealous
over
you
my
beloved
brothers
and
sisters
with
a
godly
jealousy
i
know
that
this
was
interpreted
by
some
of
the
saints
for
i
heard
mary
grace
say
so
to
miss
marks
as
meaning
that
my
father
was
resentful
because
some
of
them
attended
the
service
at
the
wesleyan
chapel
on
thursday
evenings
but
my
father
was
utterly
incapable
of
such
littleness
as
this
and
when
he
talked
of
he
meant
a
lofty
solicitude
a
careful
watchfulness
he
meant
that
their
spiritual
honour
was
a
matter
of
anxiety
to
him
no
doubt
when
he
used
to
tell
me
to
remember
that
our
god
is
a
jealous
god
he
meant
that
my
sins
and
shortcomings
were
not
matters
of
indifference
to
the
divine
being
but
i
think
looking
back
that
it
was
very
extraordinary
for
a
man
so
instructed
and
so
intelligent
as
he
to
dwell
so
much
on
the
possible
anger
of
the
lord
rather
than
on
his
pity
and
love
the
theory
of
extreme
puritanism
can
surely
offer
no
quainter
example
of
its
fallacy
than
this
idea
that
the
omnipotent
jehovah
could
be
seriously
offended
and
could
stoop
to
revenge
because
a
little
nervous
child
of
nine
had
disturbed
a
prayer
by
being
frightened
at
a
beetle
the
fact
that
the
word
appeared
as
the
goal
of
my
visionary
pursuits
is
not
so
inexplicable
as
it
may
seem
my
father
was
at
this
time
producing
numerous
drawings
of
minute
and
even
of
microscopic
forms
of
life
these
he
executed
in
the
manner
of
miniature
with
an
amazing
fidelity
of
form
and
with
a
brilliancy
of
colour
which
remains
unfaded
after
fifty
years
by
far
the
most
costly
of
his
pigments
was
the
intense
crimson
which
is
manufactured
out
of
the
very
spirit
and
essence
of
cochineal
i
had
lately
become
a
fervent
imitator
of
his
works
of
art
and
i
was
allowed
to
use
all
of
his
colours
except
one
i
was
strictly
forbidden
to
let
a
hair
of
my
brush
touch
the
little
broken
mass
of
carmine
which
was
all
that
he
possessed
we
believed
but
i
do
not
know
whether
this
could
be
the
fact
that
carmine
of
this
superlative
quality
was
sold
at
a
guinea
a
cake
therefore
became
my
shibboleth
of
it
was
a
symbol
of
all
that
taste
and
art
and
wealth
could
combine
to
produce
i
imagined
for
instance
that
at
belshazzar
feast
the
loftiest
epergne
of
gold
surrounded
by
flowers
and
jewels
carried
the
monarch
proudest
possession
a
cake
of
carmine
i
knew
of
no
object
in
the
world
of
luxury
more
desirable
than
this
and
its
obsession
in
my
waking
hours
is
quite
enough
i
think
to
account
for
having
been
the
torment
of
my
dreams
the
little
incident
of
the
beetle
displays
my
father
mood
at
this
period
in
its
worst
light
his
severity
was
not
very
creditable
perhaps
to
his
good
sense
but
without
a
word
of
explanation
it
may
seem
even
more
unreasonable
than
it
was
my
father
might
have
been
less
stern
to
my
lapses
from
high
conduct
and
my
own
mind
at
the
same
time
less
armoured
against
his
arrows
if
our
relations
had
been
those
which
exist
in
an
ordinary
religious
family
he
would
have
been
more
indulgent
and
my
own
affections
might
nevertheless
have
been
more
easily
alienated
if
i
had
been
treated
by
him
as
a
commonplace
child
standing
as
yet
outside
the
pale
of
conscious
christianity
but
he
had
formed
the
idea
and
cultivated
it
assiduously
that
i
was
an
a
being
to
whom
the
mysteries
of
salvation
had
been
divinely
revealed
and
by
whom
they
had
been
accepted
i
was
to
his
partial
fancy
one
in
whom
the
holy
ghost
had
already
performed
a
real
and
permanent
work
hence
i
was
inside
the
pale
i
had
attained
that
inner
position
which
divided
as
we
used
to
say
the
sheep
from
the
goats
another
little
boy
might
be
very
but
if
he
had
not
consciously
hold
on
christ
his
good
deeds
so
far
were
absolutely
useless
whereas
i
might
be
a
very
naughty
boy
and
require
much
chastisement
from
god
and
man
but
nothing
so
my
father
thought
could
invalidate
my
election
and
sooner
or
later
perhaps
even
after
many
stripes
i
must
inevitably
be
brought
back
to
a
state
of
grace
the
paradox
between
this
unquestionable
sanctification
by
faith
and
my
equally
unquestionable
naughtiness
occupied
my
father
greatly
at
this
time
he
made
it
a
frequent
subject
of
intercession
at
family
prayers
not
caring
to
hide
from
the
servants
misdemeanours
of
mine
which
he
spread
out
with
a
melancholy
unction
before
the
lord
he
cultivated
the
belief
that
all
my
little
ailments
all
my
aches
and
pains
were
sent
to
correct
my
faults
he
carried
this
persuasion
very
far
even
putting
this
exhortation
before
instead
of
after
an
instant
relief
of
my
sufferings
if
i
burned
my
finger
with
a
sulphur
match
or
pinched
the
end
of
my
nose
in
the
door
to
mention
but
two
sorrows
that
recur
to
my
memory
my
father
would
solemnly
ejaculate
may
these
afflictions
be
much
sanctified
to
him
before
offering
any
remedy
for
my
pain
so
that
i
almost
longed
under
the
pressure
of
these
pangs
to
be
a
godless
child
who
had
never
known
the
privileges
of
saving
grace
since
i
argued
that
such
a
child
would
be
subjected
to
none
of
the
sufferings
which
seemed
to
assail
my
path
what
the
ideas
or
conduct
of
child
might
be
i
had
however
at
this
time
no
idea
for
strange
as
it
may
sound
i
had
not
until
my
tenth
year
was
far
advanced
made
acquaintance
with
any
such
creature
the
had
children
but
i
was
not
called
upon
to
cultivate
their
company
and
i
had
not
the
slightest
wish
to
do
so
but
early
in
i
was
allowed
at
last
to
associate
with
a
child
of
my
own
age
i
do
not
recall
that
this
permission
gave
me
any
rapture
i
accepted
it
philosophically
but
without
that
delighted
eagerness
which
i
might
have
been
expected
to
show
my
earliest
companion
then
was
a
little
boy
of
almost
exactly
my
own
age
his
name
was
benny
which
no
doubt
was
short
for
benjamin
his
surname
was
jeffries
his
mother
i
think
he
had
no
father
was
a
solemn
and
shadowy
lady
of
means
who
lived
in
a
villa
which
was
older
and
much
larger
than
ours
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
going
to
with
benny
involved
a
small
public
excursion
and
this
i
was
now
allowed
to
make
by
myself
an
immense
source
of
respect
everything
in
my
little
memories
seems
to
run
askew
obviously
i
ought
to
have
been
extremely
stirred
and
broadened
by
this
earliest
association
with
a
boy
of
my
own
age
yet
i
can
not
truly
say
that
it
was
so
benny
mother
possessed
what
seemed
to
me
a
vast
domain
with
lawns
winding
among
broad
shrubberies
and
a
with
aged
in
it
the
ripeness
of
this
place
mossed
and
leafy
was
gratifying
to
my
senses
on
which
the
rawness
of
our
own
bald
garden
jarred
there
was
an
old
brick
wall
between
the
two
divisions
upon
which
it
was
possible
for
us
to
climb
up
and
from
this
we
gained
which
were
a
prodigious
pleasure
but
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
how
to
i
had
never
learned
had
never
heard
of
any
i
think
benny
must
have
lacked
initiative
almost
as
much
as
i
did
we
walked
about
and
shook
the
bushes
and
climbed
along
the
wall
i
think
that
was
almost
all
we
ever
did
do
and
sadly
enough
i
can
not
recover
a
phrase
from
benny
lips
nor
an
action
nor
a
gesture
although
i
remember
quite
clearly
how
some
people
of
that
time
looked
and
the
very
words
they
said
for
example
i
recollect
miss
wilkes
very
distinctly
since
i
studied
her
with
great
deliberation
and
with
a
suspicious
watchfulness
that
was
above
my
years
in
miss
wilkes
a
type
that
had
hitherto
been
absolutely
unfamiliar
to
us
obtruded
upon
our
experience
in
our
eveless
eden
woman
if
not
exactly
et
had
always
been
a
certain
age
but
miss
wilkes
was
a
comparatively
young
thing
and
she
advanced
not
by
any
means
unconscious
of
her
charms
all
was
feminine
all
was
impulsive
about
miss
wilkes
every
gesture
seemed
eloquent
with
girlish
innocence
and
the
playful
dawn
of
life
in
actual
years
i
fancy
she
was
not
so
extremely
youthful
since
she
was
the
responsible
and
trusted
headmistress
of
a
large
for
girls
but
in
her
heart
the
joy
of
life
ran
high
miss
wilkes
had
a
small
round
face
with
melting
eyes
and
when
she
lifted
her
head
her
ringlets
seemed
to
vibrate
and
shiver
like
the
bells
of
a
pagoda
she
had
a
charming
way
of
clasping
her
hands
and
holding
them
against
her
bodice
while
she
said
but
really
now
in
a
manner
inexpressibly
engaging
she
was
very
earnest
and
she
had
a
pleading
way
of
calling
out
but
are
you
teasing
me
which
would
have
brought
a
tiger
fawning
to
her
crinoline
after
we
had
spent
a
full
year
without
any
social
distractions
it
seems
that
our
circle
of
acquaintances
had
now
begun
to
extend
in
spite
of
my
father
unwillingness
to
visit
his
neighbours
he
was
a
fortress
that
required
to
be
stormed
but
there
was
considerable
local
curiosity
about
him
so
that
by
escalading
parties
were
formed
some
of
which
were
partly
successful
in
the
first
place
charles
kingsley
had
never
hesitated
to
come
from
the
beginning
ever
since
our
arrival
he
had
reason
to
visit
our
neighbouring
town
rather
frequently
and
on
such
occasions
he
always
marched
up
and
attacked
us
it
was
extraordinary
how
persistent
he
was
for
my
father
must
have
been
a
very
trying
friend
i
vividly
recollect
that
a
sort
of
examination
of
communicants
was
going
on
in
our
furnished
one
weekday
morning
when
kingsley
was
announced
my
father
in
stentorian
tones
replied
kingsley
that
i
am
engaged
in
examining
scripture
with
certain
of
the
lord
children
and
i
a
little
later
kneeling
at
the
window
while
the
candidates
were
being
dismissed
with
prayer
watched
the
author
of
nervously
careening
about
the
garden
very
restless
and
impatient
yet
preferring
this
ignominy
to
the
chance
of
losing
my
father
company
altogether
kingsley
a
daring
spirit
used
sometimes
to
drag
us
out
trawling
with
him
in
torbay
and
although
his
hawk
beak
and
rattling
voice
frightened
me
a
little
his
was
always
a
jolly
presence
that
brought
some
refreshment
to
our
seriousness
but
the
other
visitors
who
came
in
kingsley
wake
and
without
his
excuse
how
they
disturbed
us
we
used
to
be
seated
my
father
at
his
microscope
i
with
my
map
or
book
in
the
stairs
room
we
called
the
study
there
would
be
a
hush
around
us
in
which
you
could
hear
a
sigh
then
abruptly
would
come
a
ring
at
the
front
door
my
father
would
bend
at
me
a
corrugated
brow
and
murmur
under
his
breath
that
and
then
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
would
bolt
into
the
verandah
and
around
the
garden
into
the
if
it
was
no
visitor
more
serious
than
the
postman
or
the
i
used
to
go
forth
and
coax
the
timid
wanderer
home
if
it
was
a
caller
above
all
a
female
caller
it
was
my
privilege
to
prevaricate
remarking
innocently
that
is
out
into
a
paradise
so
carefully
guarded
i
know
not
how
that
serpent
miss
wilkes
could
penetrate
but
there
she
was
she
with
the
brethren
at
the
adjacent
town
from
which
she
carried
on
strategical
movements
which
were
up
to
a
certain
point
highly
successful
she
professed
herself
deeply
interested
in
microscopy
and
desired
that
some
of
her
young
ladies
should
study
it
also
she
came
attended
by
an
unimportant
man
and
by
pupils
to
whom
i
had
sometimes
very
unwillingly
to
show
our
objects
they
would
invade
us
and
all
our
quietness
with
chattering
noise
i
could
bear
none
of
them
and
i
was
singularly
drawn
to
miss
marks
by
finding
that
she
disliked
them
too
by
whatever
arts
she
worked
miss
wilkes
certainly
achieved
a
certain
ascendancy
when
the
knocks
came
at
the
front
door
i
was
now
instructed
to
see
whether
the
visitor
were
not
she
before
my
father
bolted
to
the
she
was
an
untiring
listener
and
my
father
had
a
genius
for
instruction
miss
wilkes
was
never
weary
of
expressing
what
a
revelation
of
the
wonderful
works
of
god
in
creation
her
acquaintance
with
us
had
been
she
would
gaze
through
the
microscope
at
awful
forms
and
would
persevere
until
the
silver
rim
which
marked
the
confines
of
the
drop
of
water
under
inspection
would
ripple
inwards
with
a
flash
of
light
and
vanish
because
the
drop
itself
had
evaporated
i
can
only
say
how
marvellous
are
thy
doings
was
a
frequent
ejaculation
of
miss
wilkes
and
one
that
was
very
well
received
she
learned
the
latin
names
of
many
of
the
species
and
it
seems
quite
pathetic
to
me
looking
back
to
realize
how
much
trouble
the
poor
woman
took
she
as
the
expression
is
upon
my
father
every
word
and
one
instance
of
this
led
to
a
certain
revelation
my
father
who
had
an
extraordinary
way
of
saying
anything
what
came
into
his
mind
stated
one
day
the
fashions
i
must
suppose
being
under
discussion
that
he
thought
white
the
only
becoming
colour
for
a
lady
stockings
the
stockings
of
miss
wilkes
had
up
to
that
hour
been
of
a
deep
violet
but
she
wore
white
ones
in
future
whenever
she
came
to
our
house
this
delicacy
would
have
been
beyond
my
unaided
infant
observation
but
i
heard
miss
marks
mention
the
matter
in
terms
which
they
supposed
to
be
secret
to
her
confidante
and
i
verified
it
at
the
ankles
of
the
lady
miss
marks
continued
by
saying
in
confidence
and
as
between
you
and
me
dear
mary
grace
that
miss
wilkes
was
a
i
had
the
greatest
curiosity
about
words
and
as
this
was
a
new
one
i
looked
it
up
in
our
large
dictionary
but
there
the
definition
of
the
term
was
this
the
female
of
minnock
a
pert
wanton
i
was
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
whether
she
was
the
female
of
a
minnock
whatever
that
may
be
or
whether
she
was
only
a
very
schoolmistress
desirous
of
enlivening
a
monotonous
existence
miss
wilkes
certainly
took
us
out
of
ourselves
a
good
deal
did
my
father
know
what
danger
he
ran
it
was
the
opinion
of
miss
marks
and
of
mary
grace
that
he
did
not
and
in
the
a
room
which
served
those
ladies
as
a
private
oratory
in
the
much
prayer
was
offered
up
that
his
eyes
might
be
opened
ere
it
was
too
late
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
they
were
open
all
the
time
that
at
all
events
they
were
what
the
french
call
that
enough
light
for
practical
purposes
came
sifted
in
through
his
eyelashes
at
a
later
time
being
reminded
of
miss
wilkes
he
said
with
a
certain
complaisance
yes
she
proffered
much
entertainment
during
my
widowed
years
he
used
to
go
down
to
her
the
garden
of
which
had
been
the
scene
of
a
murder
and
was
romantically
situated
on
the
edge
of
a
quarried
cliff
he
always
took
me
with
him
and
kept
me
at
his
side
all
through
these
visits
notwithstanding
miss
wilkes
solicitude
that
the
fatigue
and
excitement
would
be
too
much
for
the
dear
strength
unless
i
rested
a
little
on
the
parlour
sofa
about
this
time
the
question
of
my
education
came
up
for
discussion
in
the
household
as
indeed
it
well
might
miss
marks
had
long
proved
practically
inadequate
in
this
respect
her
slender
acquirements
evaporating
i
suppose
like
the
drops
of
water
under
the
microscope
while
the
field
of
her
general
duties
became
wider
the
subjects
in
which
i
took
pleasure
and
upon
which
i
possessed
books
i
sedulously
taught
myself
the
other
subjects
which
formed
the
vast
majority
i
did
not
learn
at
all
like
aurora
leigh
i
brushed
with
extreme
flounce
the
circle
of
the
universe
especially
zoology
botany
and
astronomy
but
with
the
explicit
exception
of
geology
which
my
father
regarded
as
tending
directly
to
the
encouragement
of
infidelity
i
copied
a
great
quantity
of
maps
and
read
all
the
books
of
travels
that
i
could
find
but
i
acquired
no
mathematics
no
languages
no
history
so
that
i
was
in
danger
of
gross
illiteracy
in
these
important
departments
my
father
grudged
the
time
but
he
felt
it
a
duty
to
do
something
to
fill
up
these
deficiencies
and
we
now
started
latin
in
a
little
out
of
which
my
grandfather
had
been
taught
it
consisted
of
strings
of
words
and
of
grim
arrangements
of
conjunction
and
declension
presented
in
a
manner
appallingly
unattractive
i
used
to
be
set
down
in
the
study
under
my
father
eye
to
learn
a
solid
page
of
this
compilation
while
he
wrote
or
painted
the
window
would
be
open
in
summer
and
my
seat
was
close
to
it
outside
a
bee
was
shaking
the
or
a
butterfly
was
opening
and
shutting
his
wings
on
the
hot
concrete
of
the
verandah
or
a
blackbird
was
racing
across
the
lawn
it
was
almost
more
than
human
nature
could
bear
to
have
to
sit
holding
up
to
my
face
the
dreary
little
latin
book
with
its
sheepskin
cover
that
smelt
of
mildewed
paste
but
out
of
this
strength
there
came
an
unexpected
sudden
sweetness
the
exercise
of
hearing
me
repeat
my
strings
of
nouns
and
verbs
had
revived
in
my
father
his
memories
of
the
classics
in
the
old
solitary
years
a
long
time
ago
by
the
shores
of
canadian
rapids
on
the
edge
of
west
indian
swamps
his
virgil
had
been
an
inestimable
solace
to
him
to
extremely
devout
persons
there
is
something
objectionable
in
most
of
the
great
writers
of
antiquity
horace
lucretius
terence
catullus
juvenal
in
each
there
is
one
quality
or
another
definitely
repulsive
to
a
reader
who
is
determined
to
know
nothing
but
christ
and
him
crucified
from
time
immemorial
however
it
has
been
recognized
in
the
christian
church
that
this
objection
does
not
apply
to
virgil
he
is
the
most
evangelical
of
the
classics
he
is
the
one
who
can
be
enjoyed
with
least
to
explain
away
and
least
to
excuse
one
evening
my
father
took
down
his
virgil
from
an
upper
shelf
and
his
thoughts
wandered
away
from
surrounding
things
he
travelled
in
the
past
again
the
book
was
a
delphin
edition
of
which
had
followed
him
in
all
his
wanderings
there
was
a
great
scratch
on
the
cover
that
a
thorn
had
made
in
a
forest
of
alabama
and
then
in
the
twilight
as
he
shut
the
volume
at
last
oblivious
of
my
presence
he
began
to
murmur
and
to
chant
the
adorable
verses
by
memory
tityre
tu
patulae
recubans
sub
tegmine
fagi
he
warbled
and
i
stopped
my
play
and
listened
as
if
to
a
nightingale
until
he
reached
tu
tityre
lentus
in
umbra
formosam
resonare
doces
amaryllida
silvan
papa
what
is
that
i
could
not
prevent
myself
from
asking
he
translated
the
verses
he
explained
their
meaning
but
his
exposition
gave
me
little
interest
what
to
me
was
beautiful
amaryllis
she
and
her
tityrus
awakened
no
image
whatever
in
my
mind
but
a
miracle
had
been
revealed
to
me
the
incalculable
the
amazing
beauty
which
could
exist
in
the
sound
of
verses
my
prosodical
instinct
was
awakened
quite
suddenly
that
dim
evening
as
my
father
and
i
sat
alone
in
the
after
tea
serenely
accepting
the
hour
for
once
with
no
idea
of
exhortation
or
profit
verse
breeze
mid
blossoms
playing
as
coleridge
says
descended
from
the
roses
as
a
moth
might
have
done
and
the
magic
of
it
took
hold
of
my
heart
forever
i
persuaded
my
father
who
was
a
little
astonished
at
my
insistence
to
repeat
the
lines
over
and
over
again
at
last
my
brain
caught
them
and
as
i
walked
in
benny
garden
or
as
i
hung
over
the
tidal
pools
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
all
my
inner
being
used
to
ring
out
with
the
sound

chapter
viii
in
the
previous
chapter
i
have
dwelt
on
some
of
the
lighter
conditions
of
our
life
at
this
time
i
must
now
turn
to
it
in
a
less
frivolous
aspect
as
my
tenth
year
advanced
the
development
of
my
character
gave
my
father
i
will
not
say
anxiety
but
matter
for
serious
reflection
my
intelligence
was
now
perceived
to
be
taking
a
sudden
start
visitors
drew
my
father
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
was
out
so
much
i
grew
rapidly
in
stature
having
been
a
little
shrimp
of
a
thing
up
to
that
time
and
i
no
longer
appeared
much
younger
than
my
years
looking
back
i
do
not
think
that
there
was
any
sudden
mental
development
but
that
the
change
was
mainly
a
social
one
i
had
been
reserved
timid
and
taciturn
i
had
disliked
the
company
of
strangers
but
with
my
tenth
year
i
certainly
unfolded
so
far
as
to
become
sociable
and
talkative
and
perhaps
i
struck
those
around
me
as
grown
because
i
said
the
things
which
i
had
previously
only
thought
there
was
a
change
no
doubt
yet
i
believe
that
it
was
mainly
physical
rather
than
mental
my
excessive
fragility
or
apparent
fragility
for
i
must
have
been
always
wiry
decreased
i
slept
better
and
therefore
grew
less
nervous
i
ate
better
and
therefore
put
on
flesh
if
i
preserved
a
delicate
look
people
still
used
to
say
in
my
presence
dear
child
is
not
long
for
this
world
it
was
in
consequence
of
a
sort
of
habit
into
which
my
body
had
grown
it
was
a
transparency
which
did
not
speak
of
what
was
in
store
for
me
but
of
what
i
had
already
passed
through
the
increased
activity
of
my
intellectual
system
now
showed
itself
in
what
i
behove
to
be
a
very
healthy
form
direct
imitation
the
rage
for
what
is
called
is
pushed
to
such
a
length
in
these
days
that
even
children
are
not
considered
promising
unless
they
attempt
things
preposterous
and
unparalleled
from
his
earliest
hour
the
ambitious
person
is
told
that
to
make
a
road
where
none
has
walked
before
to
do
easily
what
it
is
impossible
for
others
to
do
at
all
to
create
new
forms
of
thought
and
expression
are
the
only
recipes
for
genius
and
in
trying
to
escape
on
all
sides
from
every
resemblance
to
his
predecessors
he
adopts
at
once
an
air
of
eccentricity
and
pretentiousness
this
continues
to
be
the
accepted
view
of
originality
but
in
spite
of
this
conventional
opinion
i
hold
that
the
healthy
sign
of
an
activity
of
mind
in
early
youth
is
not
to
be
striving
after
miracles
but
to
imitate
closely
and
carefully
what
is
being
said
and
done
in
the
vicinity
the
child
of
a
great
sculptor
will
hang
about
the
studio
and
will
try
to
hammer
a
head
out
of
a
waste
piece
of
marble
with
a
nail
it
does
not
follow
that
he
too
will
be
a
sculptor
the
child
of
a
politician
will
sit
in
committee
with
a
row
of
empty
chairs
and
will
harangue
an
imaginary
senate
from
behind
the
curtains
i
the
son
of
a
man
who
looked
through
a
microscope
and
painted
what
he
saw
there
would
fair
observe
for
myself
and
paint
my
observations
it
did
not
follow
alas
that
i
was
built
to
be
a
or
a
savant
but
the
activity
of
a
childish
intelligence
was
shown
by
my
desire
to
copy
the
results
of
such
energy
as
i
saw
nearest
at
hand
in
the
secular
direction
this
now
took
the
form
of
my
preparing
little
monographs
on
seaside
creatures
which
were
arranged
tabulated
and
divided
as
exactly
as
possible
on
the
pattern
of
those
which
my
father
was
composing
for
his
i
wrote
these
out
upon
sheets
of
paper
of
the
same
size
as
his
printed
page
and
i
adorned
them
with
plates
meant
to
emulate
his
precise
and
exquisite
illustrations
one
or
two
of
these
ludicrous
pastiches
are
still
preserved
and
in
glancing
at
them
now
i
wonder
not
at
any
skill
that
they
possess
but
at
the
perseverance
and
the
patience
the
evidence
of
close
and
persistent
labour
i
was
not
set
to
these
tasks
by
my
father
who
in
fact
did
not
much
approve
of
them
he
was
touched
too
with
the
heresy
and
exhorted
me
not
to
copy
him
but
to
go
out
into
the
garden
or
the
shore
and
describe
something
new
in
a
new
way
that
was
quite
impossible
i
possessed
no
initiative
but
i
can
now
well
understand
why
my
father
very
indulgently
and
deprecated
these
exercises
of
mine
they
took
up
and
as
he
might
well
think
wasted
an
enormous
quantity
of
time
and
they
were
moreover
parodies
rather
than
imitations
of
his
writings
for
i
invented
new
species
with
sapphire
spots
and
crimson
tentacles
and
amber
bands
which
were
close
enough
to
his
real
species
to
be
disconcerting
he
came
from
conscientiously
shepherding
the
flocks
of
ocean
and
i
do
not
wonder
that
my
speckled
and
spotted
varieties
put
him
out
of
countenance
if
i
had
not
been
so
innocent
and
solemn
he
might
have
fancied
i
was
mocking
him
these
extraordinary
excursions
into
science
falsely
so
called
occupied
a
large
part
of
my
time
there
was
a
little
spare
room
at
the
back
of
our
house
dedicated
to
lumber
and
to
empty
portmanteaux
there
was
a
table
in
it
already
and
i
added
a
stool
this
cheerless
apartment
now
became
my
study
i
spent
so
many
hours
here
in
solitude
and
without
making
a
sound
that
my
father
curiosity
if
not
his
suspicion
was
occasionally
aroused
and
he
would
make
a
sudden
raid
on
me
i
was
always
discovered
doubled
up
over
the
table
with
my
pen
and
ink
or
else
my
box
of
colours
and
tumbler
of
turbid
water
by
my
hand
working
away
like
a
chinese
student
shut
up
in
his
matriculating
box
it
might
have
been
done
for
a
wager
if
anything
so
simple
had
ever
been
dreamed
of
in
our
pious
household
the
apparatus
was
slow
and
laboured
in
order
to
keep
my
uncouth
handwriting
in
bounds
i
was
obliged
to
rule
not
lines
only
but
borders
to
my
pages
the
subject
did
not
lend
itself
to
any
flow
of
language
and
i
was
obliged
incessantly
to
borrow
sentences
word
for
word
from
my
father
published
books
discouraged
by
everyone
around
me
daunted
by
the
laborious
effort
needful
to
carry
out
the
scheme
it
seems
odd
to
me
now
that
i
persisted
in
so
strange
and
wearisome
an
employment
but
it
became
an
absorbing
passion
and
was
indulged
in
to
the
neglect
of
other
lessons
and
other
pleasures
my
father
as
the
spring
advanced
used
to
come
up
to
the
boxroom
as
my
retreat
was
called
and
hunt
me
out
into
the
sunshine
but
i
soon
crept
back
to
my
mania
it
gave
him
much
trouble
and
miss
marks
who
thought
it
sheer
idleness
was
vociferous
in
objection
she
would
gladly
have
torn
up
all
my
writings
and
paintings
and
have
set
me
to
a
useful
task
my
father
with
his
strong
natural
individualism
could
not
take
this
view
he
was
interested
in
this
strange
freak
of
mine
and
he
could
not
wholly
condemn
it
but
he
must
have
thought
is
a
little
crazy
and
it
is
evident
to
me
now
that
it
led
to
the
revolution
in
domestic
policy
by
which
he
began
to
encourage
any
acquaintance
with
other
young
people
as
much
as
he
had
previously
discouraged
it
he
saw
that
i
could
not
be
allowed
to
spend
my
whole
time
in
a
little
stuffy
room
making
solemn
and
ridiculous
imitations
of
papers
read
before
the
linnaean
society
he
was
grieved
moreover
at
the
badness
of
my
pictures
for
i
had
no
native
skill
and
he
tried
to
teach
me
his
own
system
of
as
applied
to
natural
history
i
was
forced
in
deep
depression
of
spirits
to
turn
from
my
grotesque
monographs
and
paint
under
my
father
eye
and
from
a
finished
drawing
of
his
a
gorgeous
tropic
bird
in
flight
aided
by
my
habit
of
imitation
i
did
at
length
produce
some
thing
which
might
have
shown
promise
if
it
had
not
been
wrung
from
me
touch
by
touch
pigment
by
pigment
under
the
orders
of
a
all
this
had
its
absurd
side
but
i
seem
to
perceive
that
it
had
also
its
value
it
is
surely
a
mistake
to
look
too
near
at
hand
for
the
benefits
of
education
what
is
actually
taught
in
early
childhood
is
often
that
part
of
training
which
makes
least
impression
on
the
character
and
is
of
the
least
permanent
importance
my
labours
failed
to
make
me
a
zoologist
and
the
multitude
of
my
designs
and
my
descriptions
have
left
me
helplessly
ignorant
of
the
anatomy
of
a
yet
i
can
not
look
upon
the
mental
discipline
as
useless
it
taught
me
to
concentrate
my
attention
to
define
the
nature
of
distinctions
to
see
accurately
and
to
name
what
i
saw
moreover
it
gave
me
the
habit
of
going
on
with
any
piece
of
work
i
had
in
hand
not
flagging
because
the
interest
or
picturesqueness
of
the
theme
had
declined
but
pushing
forth
towards
a
definite
goal
well
foreseen
and
limited
beforehand
for
almost
any
intellectual
employment
in
later
life
it
seems
to
me
that
this
discipline
was
valuable
i
am
however
not
the
less
conscious
how
ludicrous
was
the
mode
in
which
in
my
tenth
year
i
obtained
it
my
spiritual
condition
occupied
my
father
thoughts
very
insistently
at
this
time
closing
as
he
did
most
of
the
doors
of
worldly
pleasure
and
energy
upon
his
conscience
he
had
continued
to
pursue
his
scientific
investigations
without
any
sense
of
sin
most
fortunate
it
was
that
the
collecting
of
marine
animals
in
the
tidal
pools
and
the
description
of
them
in
pages
which
were
addressed
to
the
wide
scientific
public
at
no
time
occurred
to
him
as
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
his
holy
calling
his
conscience
was
so
delicate
and
often
so
morbid
in
its
delicacy
that
if
that
had
occurred
to
him
he
would
certainly
have
abandoned
his
investigations
and
have
been
left
without
an
employment
but
happily
he
justified
his
investigation
by
regarding
it
as
a
glorification
of
god
created
works
in
the
introduction
of
his
written
at
the
time
which
i
have
now
reached
in
this
narrative
he
sent
forth
his
labours
with
a
phrase
which
i
should
think
unparalleled
in
connection
with
a
learned
and
technical
biological
treatise
he
stated
concerning
that
book
that
he
published
it
one
more
tribute
humbly
offered
to
the
glory
of
the
triune
god
who
is
wonderful
in
counsel
and
excellent
in
working
scientific
investigation
sincerely
carried
out
in
that
spirit
became
a
kind
of
weekday
interpretation
of
the
current
creed
of
sundays
the
development
of
my
faculties
of
which
i
have
spoken
extended
to
the
religious
sphere
no
less
than
to
the
secular
here
also
as
i
look
back
i
see
that
i
was
extremely
imitative
i
expanded
in
the
warmth
of
my
father
fervour
and
on
the
whole
in
a
manner
that
was
satisfactory
to
him
he
observed
the
richer
hold
that
i
was
now
taking
on
life
he
saw
my
faculties
branching
in
many
directions
and
he
became
very
anxious
to
secure
my
maintenance
in
grace
in
earlier
years
certain
sides
of
my
character
had
offered
a
sort
of
passive
resistance
to
his
ideas
i
had
let
what
i
did
not
care
to
welcome
pass
over
my
mind
in
the
curious
density
that
children
adopt
in
order
to
avoid
receiving
impressions
blankly
dumbly
achieving
by
stupidity
what
they
can
not
achieve
by
argument
i
think
that
i
had
frequently
done
this
that
he
had
been
brought
up
against
a
dead
wall
although
on
other
sides
of
my
nature
i
had
been
responsive
and
docile
but
now
in
my
tenth
year
the
imitative
faculty
got
the
upper
hand
and
nothing
seemed
so
attractive
as
to
be
what
i
was
expected
to
be
if
there
was
a
doubt
now
it
lay
in
the
other
direction
it
seemed
hardly
normal
that
so
young
a
child
should
appear
so
receptive
and
so
apt
my
father
believed
himself
justified
at
this
juncture
in
making
a
tremendous
effort
he
wished
to
secure
me
finally
exhaustively
before
the
age
of
puberty
could
dawn
before
my
soul
was
fettered
with
the
love
of
carnal
things
he
thought
that
if
i
could
now
be
identified
with
the
and
could
stand
on
exactly
their
footing
a
habit
of
conformity
would
be
secured
i
should
meet
the
paganizing
tendencies
of
advancing
years
with
security
if
i
could
be
forearmed
with
all
the
weapons
of
a
sanctified
life
he
wished
me
in
short
to
be
received
into
the
community
of
the
brethren
on
the
terms
of
an
adult
there
were
difficulties
in
the
way
of
carrying
out
this
scheme
and
they
were
urged
upon
him
more
or
less
courageously
by
the
elders
of
the
church
but
he
overbore
them
what
the
difficulties
were
and
what
were
the
arguments
which
he
used
to
sweep
those
difficulties
away
i
must
now
explain
for
in
this
lay
the
centre
of
our
future
relations
as
father
and
son
in
dealing
with
the
peasants
around
him
among
whom
he
was
engaged
in
an
active
propaganda
my
father
always
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
conversion
there
must
be
a
new
birth
and
being
a
fresh
creation
in
god
this
crisis
he
was
accustomed
to
regard
as
manifesting
itself
in
a
sudden
and
definite
upheaval
there
might
have
been
prolonged
practical
piety
deep
and
true
contrition
for
sin
but
these
although
the
natural
and
suitable
prologue
to
conversion
were
not
conversion
itself
people
hung
on
at
the
confines
of
regeneration
often
for
a
very
long
time
my
father
dealt
earnestly
with
them
the
elders
ministered
to
them
with
explanation
exhortation
and
prayer
such
persons
were
in
a
gracious
state
but
they
were
not
in
a
state
of
grace
if
they
should
suddenly
die
they
would
pass
away
in
an
unconverted
condition
and
all
that
could
be
said
in
their
favour
was
a
vague
expression
of
hope
that
they
would
benefit
from
uncovenanted
mercies
but
on
some
day
at
some
hour
and
minute
if
life
was
spared
to
them
the
way
of
salvation
would
be
revealed
to
these
persons
in
such
an
aspect
that
they
would
be
enabled
instantaneously
to
accept
it
they
would
take
it
consciously
as
one
takes
a
gift
from
the
hand
that
offers
it
this
act
of
taking
was
the
process
of
conversion
and
the
person
who
so
accepted
was
a
child
of
god
now
although
a
single
minute
ago
he
had
been
a
child
of
wrath
the
very
root
of
human
nature
had
to
be
changed
and
in
the
majority
of
cases
this
change
was
sudden
patent
and
palpable
i
have
just
said
the
majority
of
cases
because
my
father
admitted
the
possibility
of
exceptions
the
formula
was
any
man
hath
not
the
spirit
of
christ
he
is
none
of
his
as
a
rule
no
one
could
possess
the
spirit
of
christ
without
a
conscious
and
full
abandonment
of
the
soul
and
this
however
carefully
led
up
to
and
prepared
for
with
tears
and
renunciations
was
not
could
not
be
made
except
at
a
set
moment
of
time
faith
in
an
esoteric
and
almost
symbolic
sense
was
necessary
and
could
not
be
a
result
of
argument
but
was
a
state
of
heart
in
these
opinions
my
father
departed
in
no
ways
from
the
strict
evangelical
doctrine
of
the
protestant
churches
but
he
held
it
in
a
mode
and
with
a
severity
peculiar
to
himself
now
it
is
plain
that
this
state
of
heart
this
voluntary
deed
of
acceptance
presupposed
a
full
and
rational
consciousness
of
the
relations
of
things
it
might
be
clearly
achieved
by
a
person
of
humble
cultivation
but
only
by
one
who
was
fully
capable
of
independent
thought
in
other
words
by
a
more
or
less
adult
person
the
man
or
woman
claiming
the
privileges
of
conversion
must
be
able
to
understand
and
to
grasp
what
his
religious
education
was
aiming
at
it
is
extraordinary
what
trouble
it
often
gave
my
father
to
know
whether
he
was
justified
in
admitting
to
the
communion
people
of
very
limited
powers
of
expression
a
harmless
humble
labouring
man
would
come
with
a
request
to
be
allowed
to
bread
it
was
only
by
the
use
of
strong
leading
questions
that
he
could
be
induced
to
mention
christ
as
the
ground
of
his
trust
at
all
i
recollect
an
elderly
agricultural
labourer
being
closeted
for
a
long
time
with
my
father
who
came
out
at
last
in
a
sort
of
dazed
condition
and
replied
to
our
inquiries
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
he
said
it
was
obliged
to
put
the
name
and
blood
and
work
of
jesus
into
his
very
mouth
it
is
true
that
he
assented
cordially
at
last
but
i
confess
i
was
grievously
daunted
by
the
poor
intelligence
but
there
was
or
there
might
be
another
class
of
persona
whom
early
training
separation
from
the
world
and
the
care
of
godly
parents
had
so
early
familiarized
with
the
acceptable
calling
of
christ
that
their
conversion
had
occurred
unperceived
and
therefore
unrecorded
at
an
extraordinarily
earl
age
it
would
be
in
vain
to
look
for
a
repetition
of
the
phenomenon
in
those
cases
the
heavenly
fire
must
not
be
expected
to
descend
a
second
time
the
lips
are
touched
with
the
burning
coal
once
and
once
only
if
accordingly
these
precociously
selected
spirits
are
to
be
excluded
because
no
new
birth
is
observed
in
them
at
a
mature
age
they
must
continue
outside
in
the
cold
since
the
phenomenon
can
not
be
repeated
when
therefore
there
is
not
possible
any
further
doubt
of
their
being
in
possession
of
salvation
longer
delay
is
useless
and
worse
than
useless
the
fact
of
conversion
though
not
recorded
nor
even
recollected
must
be
accepted
on
the
evidence
of
confession
of
faith
and
as
soon
as
the
intelligence
is
evidently
developed
the
person
not
merely
may
but
should
be
accepted
into
communion
although
still
immature
in
body
although
in
years
still
even
a
child
this
my
father
believed
to
be
my
case
and
in
this
rare
class
did
he
fondly
persuade
himself
to
station
me
as
i
have
said
the
congregation
although
docile
and
timid
and
little
able
as
units
to
hold
their
own
against
their
minister
behind
his
back
were
faintly
hostile
to
this
plan
none
of
their
own
children
had
ever
been
so
much
as
suggested
for
membership
and
each
of
themselves
in
ripe
years
had
been
subjected
to
severe
i
think
it
was
rather
a
bitter
pill
for
some
of
them
to
swallow
that
a
pert
little
boy
of
ten
should
be
admitted
as
a
person
to
all
the
privileges
of
their
order
mary
grace
burmington
came
back
from
her
visits
to
the
cottagers
reporting
disaffection
here
and
there
grumblings
in
the
rank
and
file
but
quite
as
many
especially
of
the
women
enthusiastically
supported
my
father
wish
gloried
aloud
in
the
manifestations
of
my
early
piety
and
professed
to
see
in
it
something
of
miraculous
promise
the
expression
infant
samuel
was
widely
used
i
became
quite
a
subject
of
contention
a
war
of
the
sexes
threatened
to
break
out
over
me
i
was
a
disturbing
element
at
cottage
breakfasts
i
was
mentioned
at
public
not
indeed
by
name
but
in
the
extraordinary
allusive
way
customary
in
our
devotions
as
amongst
us
of
tender
years
or
as
sapling
in
the
vineyard
to
all
this
my
father
put
a
stop
in
his
own
fashion
after
the
morning
meeting
one
sunday
in
the
autumn
of
he
desired
the
attention
of
the
saints
to
a
personal
matter
which
was
perhaps
not
unfamiliar
to
them
by
rumour
that
was
he
explained
the
question
of
the
admission
of
his
beloved
little
son
to
the
communion
of
saints
in
the
breaking
of
bread
he
allowed
and
i
sat
there
in
evidence
palely
smiling
at
the
audience
my
feet
scarcely
touching
the
ground
that
i
was
not
what
is
styled
adult
i
was
not
he
frankly
admitted
a
person
but
i
was
adult
in
a
knowledge
of
the
lord
i
possessed
an
insight
into
the
plan
of
salvation
which
many
a
hoary
head
might
envy
for
its
fullness
its
clearness
its
conformity
with
scripture
doctrine
this
was
a
palpable
hit
at
more
than
one
stumbler
and
fumbler
after
the
truth
and
several
hoary
heads
were
bowed
my
father
then
went
on
to
explain
very
fully
the
position
which
i
have
already
attempted
to
define
he
admitted
the
absence
in
my
case
of
a
sudden
apparent
act
of
conversion
resulting
upon
conviction
of
sin
but
he
stated
the
grounds
of
his
belief
that
i
had
in
still
earlier
infancy
been
converted
and
he
declared
that
if
so
i
ought
no
longer
to
be
excluded
from
the
privileges
of
communion
he
said
moreover
that
he
was
willing
on
this
occasion
to
waive
his
own
privilege
as
a
minister
and
that
he
would
rather
call
on
brother
fawkes
and
brother
bere
the
leading
elders
to
examine
the
candidate
in
his
stead
this
was
a
stroke
for
brothers
fawkes
and
bere
had
been
suspected
of
leading
the
disaffection
and
this
threw
all
the
burden
of
responsibility
on
them
the
meeting
broke
up
in
great
amiability
and
my
father
and
i
went
home
together
in
the
very
highest
of
spirits
i
indeed
in
my
pride
crossed
the
verge
of
indiscretion
by
saying
i
have
been
admitted
to
fellowship
papa
shall
i
be
allowed
to
call
you
beloved
brother
my
father
was
too
well
pleased
with
the
morning
work
to
be
critical
he
laughed
and
answered
my
love
though
strictly
correct
would
hardly
i
fear
be
thought
judicious
it
was
suggested
that
my
tenth
birthday
which
followed
this
public
announcement
by
a
few
days
would
be
a
capital
occasion
for
me
to
go
through
the
ordeal
accordingly
after
dark
for
our
new
lamp
was
lighted
for
the
first
time
in
honour
of
the
event
i
withdrew
alone
into
our
which
had
just
at
length
been
furnished
and
which
looked
i
thought
very
smart
hither
came
to
me
first
brother
fawkes
by
himself
then
brother
bere
by
himself
and
then
both
together
so
that
you
may
say
if
you
are
pedanticaly
inclined
that
i
underwent
three
successive
interviews
my
father
out
of
sight
somewhere
was
of
course
playing
the
part
of
stage
manager
i
felt
not
at
all
shy
but
so
highly
strung
that
my
whole
nature
seemed
to
throb
with
excitement
my
first
examiner
on
the
other
hand
was
extremely
confused
fawkes
who
was
a
builder
in
a
small
business
of
his
own
was
short
and
fat
his
complexion
which
wore
a
deeper
and
more
uniform
than
usual
i
observed
to
be
starred
with
of
nervous
emotion
which
he
wiped
away
at
intervals
with
a
large
bandana
handkerchief
he
was
so
long
in
coming
to
the
point
that
i
was
obliged
to
lead
him
to
it
myself
and
i
sat
up
on
the
sofa
in
the
full
lamplight
and
testified
my
faith
in
the
atonement
with
a
fluency
that
surprised
myself
before
i
had
done
fawkes
a
man
with
the
reputation
of
being
a
very
stiff
employer
of
labour
was
weeping
like
a
child
bere
the
carpenter
a
long
thin
and
dry
man
with
a
curiously
immobile
eye
did
not
fall
so
easily
a
prey
to
my
fascinations
he
put
me
through
my
paces
very
sharply
for
he
had
something
of
the
temper
of
an
attorney
mingled
with
his
religiousness
however
i
was
equal
to
him
and
he
too
though
he
held
his
own
head
higher
was
not
less
impressed
than
fawkes
had
been
by
the
surroundings
of
the
occasion
neither
of
them
had
ever
been
in
our
since
it
was
furnished
and
i
thought
that
each
of
them
noticed
how
smart
the
wallpaper
was
indeed
i
believe
i
drew
their
attention
to
it
after
the
two
solitary
examinations
were
over
the
elders
came
in
again
as
i
have
said
and
they
prayed
for
a
long
time
we
all
three
knelt
at
the
sofa
i
between
them
but
by
this
time
to
my
great
exaltation
of
spirits
there
had
succeeded
an
equally
dismal
depression
it
was
my
turn
now
to
weep
and
i
dimly
remember
any
father
coming
into
the
room
and
my
being
carried
up
to
bed
in
a
state
of
collapse
and
fatigue
by
the
silent
and
kindly
miss
marks
on
the
following
sunday
morning
i
was
the
principal
subject
which
occupied
an
unusually
crowded
meeting
my
father
looking
whiter
and
yet
darker
than
usual
called
upon
brother
fawkes
and
brother
bere
to
state
to
the
assembled
saints
what
their
experiences
had
been
in
connexion
with
their
visits
to
who
desired
to
be
admitted
to
the
breaking
of
bread
it
was
tremendously
exciting
to
me
to
hear
myself
spoken
of
with
this
impersonal
publicity
and
i
had
no
fear
of
the
result
events
showed
that
i
had
no
need
of
fear
fawkes
and
bere
were
sometimes
accused
of
a
rivalry
which
indeed
broke
out
a
few
years
later
and
gave
my
father
much
anxiety
and
pain
but
on
this
occasion
their
unanimity
was
wonderful
each
strove
to
exceed
the
other
in
the
tributes
which
they
paid
to
any
piety
my
answers
had
been
so
full
and
clear
my
humility
save
the
mark
had
been
so
sweet
my
acquaintance
with
scripture
so
amazing
my
testimony
to
all
the
leading
principles
of
salvation
so
distinct
and
exhaustive
that
they
could
only
say
that
they
had
felt
confounded
and
yet
deeply
cheered
and
led
far
along
their
own
heavenly
path
by
hearing
such
accents
fall
from
the
lips
of
a
babe
and
a
suckling
i
did
not
like
being
described
as
a
suckling
but
every
lot
has
its
crumpled
and
in
all
other
respects
the
report
of
the
elders
was
a
triumph
my
father
then
clenched
the
whole
matter
by
rising
and
announcing
that
i
had
expressed
an
independent
desire
to
confess
the
lord
by
the
act
of
public
baptism
immediately
after
which
i
should
be
admitted
to
communion
an
adult
emotion
ran
so
high
at
this
that
a
large
portion
of
the
congregation
insisted
on
walking
with
us
back
to
our
to
the
stupefaction
of
the
rest
of
the
villagers
my
public
baptism
was
the
central
event
of
my
whole
childhood
everything
since
the
earliest
dawn
of
consciousness
seemed
to
have
been
leading
up
to
it
everything
afterwards
seemed
to
be
leading
down
and
away
from
it
the
practice
of
immersing
communicants
on
the
at
oddicombe
had
now
been
completely
abandoned
but
we
possessed
as
yet
no
tank
for
a
baptismal
purpose
in
our
own
room
the
room
in
the
adjoining
town
however
was
really
quite
a
large
chapel
and
it
was
amply
provided
with
the
needful
conveniences
it
was
our
practice
therefore
at
this
time
to
claim
the
hospitality
of
our
neighbours
baptisms
were
made
an
occasion
for
friendly
relations
between
the
two
congregations
and
led
to
pleasant
social
intercourse
i
believe
that
the
ministers
and
elders
of
the
two
meetings
arranged
to
combine
their
forces
at
these
times
and
to
baptize
communicants
from
both
congregations
the
minister
of
the
town
meeting
was
a
very
handsome
old
gentleman
of
venerable
and
powerful
appearance
he
had
snowy
hair
and
a
long
white
beard
but
from
under
shaggy
eyebrows
there
blazed
out
great
black
eyes
which
warned
the
beholder
that
the
snow
was
an
ornament
and
not
a
sign
of
decrepitude
the
eve
of
my
baptism
at
length
drew
near
it
was
fixed
for
october
almost
exactly
three
weeks
after
my
tenth
birthday
i
was
dressed
in
old
clothes
and
a
suit
of
smarter
things
was
packed
up
in
a
bag
after
nightfall
this
accompanied
by
my
father
myself
miss
marks
and
mary
grace
was
put
in
a
cab
and
driven
a
long
way
in
the
dark
to
the
chapel
of
our
friends
there
we
were
received
in
a
blaze
of
lights
with
a
pressure
of
hands
with
a
murmur
of
voices
with
ejaculations
and
even
with
tears
and
were
conducted
amid
unspeakable
emotion
to
places
of
honour
in
the
front
row
of
the
congregation
the
scene
was
one
which
would
have
been
impressive
not
merely
to
such
hermits
as
we
were
but
even
to
worldly
persons
accustomed
to
life
and
to
its
curious
and
variegated
experiences
to
me
it
was
dazzling
beyond
words
inexpressibly
exciting
an
initiation
to
every
kind
of
publicity
and
glory
there
were
many
candidates
but
the
rest
of
them
mere
grownup
men
and
women
gave
thanks
aloud
that
it
was
their
privilege
to
follow
where
i
led
i
was
the
acknowledged
hero
of
the
hour
those
were
days
when
newspaper
enterprise
was
scarcely
in
its
infancy
and
the
event
owed
nothing
to
journalistic
effort
in
spite
of
that
the
news
of
this
remarkable
ceremony
the
immersion
of
a
little
boy
of
ten
years
old
an
adult
had
spread
far
and
wide
through
the
county
in
the
course
of
three
weeks
the
chapel
of
our
hosts
was
as
i
have
said
very
large
it
was
commonly
too
large
for
their
needs
but
on
this
night
it
was
crowded
to
the
ceiling
and
the
crowd
had
come
as
every
soft
murmur
assured
me
to
see
there
were
people
there
who
had
travelled
from
exeter
from
dartmouth
from
totnes
to
witness
so
extraordinary
a
ceremony
there
was
one
old
woman
of
who
had
come
my
neighbours
whispered
to
me
all
the
way
from
on
purpose
to
see
me
baptized
i
looked
at
her
crumpled
countenance
with
amazement
for
there
was
no
curiosity
no
interest
visible
in
it
she
sat
there
perfectly
listless
looking
at
nothing
but
chewing
between
her
toothless
gums
what
appeared
to
be
a
jujube
in
the
centre
of
the
a
number
of
planks
had
been
taken
up
and
revealed
a
pool
which
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
a
small
we
gazed
down
into
this
dark
square
of
mysterious
waters
from
the
tepid
surface
of
which
faint
swirls
of
vapour
rose
the
whole
congregation
was
arranged
tier
above
tier
about
the
four
straight
sides
of
this
pool
every
person
was
able
to
see
what
happened
in
it
without
any
unseemly
struggling
or
standing
on
forms
now
rose
an
impressive
hieratic
figure
commanding
attention
and
imploring
perfect
silence
he
held
a
small
book
in
his
hand
and
he
was
preparing
to
give
out
the
number
of
a
hymn
when
an
astounding
incident
took
place
there
was
a
great
splash
and
a
tall
young
woman
was
perceived
to
be
in
the
baptismal
pool
her
arms
waving
above
her
head
and
her
figure
held
upright
in
the
water
by
the
inflation
of
the
air
underneath
her
crinoline
which
was
blown
out
like
a
bladder
as
in
some
extravagant
old
whether
her
feet
touched
the
bottom
of
the
font
i
can
not
say
but
i
suppose
they
did
so
an
indescribable
turmoil
of
shrieks
and
cries
followed
on
this
extraordinary
apparition
a
great
many
people
excitedly
called
upon
other
people
to
be
calm
and
an
instance
was
given
of
the
remark
of
james
smith
that
he
who
in
quest
of
quiet
hoots
is
apt
to
make
the
hubbub
he
imputes
the
young
woman
in
a
more
or
less
fainting
condition
was
presently
removed
from
the
water
and
taken
into
the
sort
of
tent
which
was
prepared
for
candidates
it
was
found
that
she
herself
had
wished
to
be
a
candidate
and
had
earnestly
desired
to
be
baptized
but
that
this
had
been
forbidden
by
her
parents
on
the
supposition
that
she
fell
in
by
accident
a
pious
coincidence
was
detected
in
this
affair
the
lord
had
that
she
should
be
baptized
in
spite
of
all
opposition
but
my
father
in
his
shrewd
way
doubted
he
pointed
out
to
us
next
morning
that
in
the
first
place
she
had
not
in
any
sense
been
baptized
as
her
head
had
not
been
immersed
and
that
in
the
second
place
she
must
have
deliberately
jumped
in
since
had
she
stumbled
and
fallen
forward
her
hands
and
face
would
have
struck
the
water
whereas
they
remained
quite
dry
she
belonged
however
to
the
neighbour
congregation
and
we
had
no
responsibility
to
pursue
the
inquiry
any
further
decorum
being
again
secured
with
unimpaired
dignity
proposed
to
the
congregation
a
hymn
which
was
long
enough
to
occupy
them
during
the
preparations
for
the
actual
baptism
he
then
retired
to
the
vestry
and
i
for
i
was
to
be
the
first
to
testify
was
led
by
miss
marks
and
mary
grace
into
the
species
of
tent
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
its
pale
sides
seemed
to
shake
with
the
jubilant
singing
of
the
saints
outside
while
part
of
my
clothing
was
removed
and
i
was
prepared
for
immersion
a
sudden
cessation
of
the
hymn
warned
us
that
to
minister
was
now
ready
and
we
emerged
into
the
glare
of
lights
and
faces
to
find
already
standing
in
the
water
up
to
his
knees
feeling
as
small
as
one
of
our
microscopical
specimens
almost
infinitesimally
tiny
as
i
descended
into
his
titanic
arms
i
was
handed
down
the
steps
to
him
he
was
dressed
in
a
kind
of
long
surplice
underneath
which
as
i
could
not
even
in
that
moment
help
observing
the
air
gathered
in
long
bubbles
which
he
strove
to
flatten
out
the
end
of
his
noble
beard
he
had
tucked
away
his
were
turned
up
at
the
wrist
the
entire
congregation
was
now
silent
so
silent
that
the
uncertain
splashing
of
my
feet
as
i
descended
seemed
to
deafen
one
a
little
embarrassed
by
my
short
stature
succeeded
at
length
in
securing
me
with
one
palm
on
my
chest
and
the
other
between
my
shoulders
he
said
slowly
in
a
loud
sonorous
voice
that
seemed
to
enter
my
brain
and
empty
it
baptize
thee
my
brother
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
having
intoned
this
formula
he
then
gently
flung
me
backwards
until
i
was
wholly
under
the
water
and
then
as
he
brought
me
up
again
and
tenderly
steadied
my
feet
on
the
steps
of
the
font
and
delivered
me
dripping
and
spluttering
into
the
anxious
hands
of
the
women
who
hurried
me
to
the
tent
the
whole
assembly
broke
forth
in
a
thunder
of
song
a
paean
of
praise
to
god
for
this
manifestation
of
his
marvellous
goodness
and
mercy
so
great
was
the
enthusiasm
that
it
could
hardly
be
restrained
so
as
to
allow
the
other
candidates
the
humdrum
adults
who
followed
in
my
wet
and
glorious
footsteps
to
undergo
a
ritual
about
which
in
their
case
no
one
in
the
congregation
pretended
to
be
able
to
take
even
the
most
languid
interest
my
father
happiness
during
the
next
few
weeks
it
is
not
pathetic
to
me
to
look
back
upon
his
sternness
melted
into
a
universal
complaisance
he
laughed
and
smiled
he
paid
to
my
opinions
the
tribute
of
the
gravest
considerations
he
indulged
utterly
unlike
his
wont
in
shy
and
furtive
caresses
i
could
express
no
wish
that
he
did
not
attempt
to
fulfill
and
the
only
warning
which
he
cared
to
give
me
was
one
very
gently
expressed
against
spiritual
pride
this
was
certainly
required
for
i
was
puffed
out
with
a
sense
of
my
own
holiness
i
was
religiously
confidential
with
my
father
condescending
with
miss
marks
who
i
think
had
given
up
trying
to
make
it
all
out
haughty
with
the
servants
and
insufferably
patronizing
with
those
young
companions
of
my
own
age
with
whom
i
was
now
beginning
to
associate
i
would
fain
close
this
remarkable
episode
on
a
key
of
solemnity
but
alas
if
i
am
to
be
loyal
to
the
truth
i
must
record
that
some
of
the
other
little
boys
presently
complained
to
mary
grace
that
i
put
out
my
tongue
at
them
in
mockery
during
the
service
in
the
room
to
remind
them
that
i
now
broke
bread
as
one
of
the
saints
and
that
they
did
not
chapter
ix
the
result
of
my
being
admitted
into
the
communion
of
the
was
that
as
soon
as
the
nine
days
wonder
of
the
thing
passed
by
my
position
became
if
anything
more
harassing
and
pressed
than
ever
it
is
true
that
freedom
was
permitted
to
me
in
certain
directions
i
was
allowed
to
act
a
little
more
on
my
own
responsibility
and
was
not
so
incessantly
informed
what
lord
will
might
be
in
this
matter
and
in
that
because
it
was
now
conceived
that
in
such
dilemmas
i
could
command
private
intelligence
of
my
own
but
there
was
no
relaxation
of
our
rigid
manner
of
life
and
i
think
i
now
began
by
comparing
it
with
the
habits
of
others
to
perceive
how
very
strict
it
was
the
main
difference
in
my
lot
as
a
communicant
from
that
of
a
mere
dweller
in
the
tents
of
righteousness
was
that
i
was
expected
to
respond
with
instant
fervour
to
every
appeal
of
conscience
when
i
did
not
do
this
my
position
was
almost
worse
than
it
had
been
before
because
of
the
livelier
nature
of
the
responsibility
which
weighed
upon
me
my
little
faults
of
conduct
too
assumed
shapes
of
terrible
importance
since
they
proceeded
from
one
so
signally
enlightened
my
father
was
never
tired
of
reminding
me
that
now
that
i
was
a
professing
christian
i
must
remember
in
everything
i
did
that
i
was
an
example
to
others
he
used
to
draw
dreadful
pictures
of
supposititious
little
boys
who
were
secretly
watching
me
from
afar
and
whose
whole
career
in
time
and
in
eternity
might
be
disastrously
affected
if
i
did
not
keep
my
lamp
burning
the
year
which
followed
upon
my
baptism
did
not
open
very
happily
at
the
room
considerable
changes
had
now
taken
place
in
the
community
my
father
impressive
services
a
certain
prestige
in
his
preaching
the
mere
fact
that
so
vigorous
a
person
was
at
the
head
of
affairs
had
induced
a
large
increase
in
the
attendance
by
this
time
if
my
memory
does
not
fail
me
as
to
dates
we
had
left
the
dismal
loft
over
the
stables
and
had
built
ourselves
a
perfectly
plain
but
commodious
and
chapel
in
the
centre
of
the
village
this
greatly
added
to
the
prosperity
of
the
meeting
everything
had
combined
to
make
our
services
popular
and
had
attracted
to
us
a
new
element
of
younger
people
numbers
of
youthful
masons
and
carpenters
and
domestic
servants
found
the
room
a
pleasant
and
were
more
or
less
superficially
induced
to
accept
salvation
as
it
was
offered
to
them
in
my
father
searching
addresses
my
father
was
very
shrewd
in
dealing
with
mere
curiosity
or
idle
motive
and
sharply
packed
off
any
youths
who
simply
came
to
make
eyes
at
the
girls
or
any
whose
only
object
was
to
display
their
new
but
he
was
powerless
against
a
temporary
sincerity
the
simulacrum
of
a
true
change
of
heart
i
have
often
heard
him
say
of
some
young
fellow
who
had
attended
our
services
with
fervour
for
a
little
while
and
then
had
turned
cold
and
left
us
i
thought
that
the
holy
ghost
had
wrought
in
him
such
disappointments
grievously
depress
an
evangelist
religious
bodies
are
liable
to
strange
and
unaccountable
fluctuations
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
year
since
our
arrival
the
congregation
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
prosperous
state
as
regards
attendance
conversions
and
other
outward
signs
of
activity
yet
it
was
quite
soon
after
this
that
my
father
began
to
be
harassed
by
all
sorts
of
troubles
and
the
spring
of
was
a
critical
moment
in
the
history
of
the
community
although
he
loved
to
take
a
very
high
tone
about
the
saints
and
involved
them
sometimes
in
a
cloud
of
laudatory
metaphysics
the
truth
was
that
they
were
nothing
more
than
peasants
of
a
somewhat
primitive
type
not
well
instructed
in
the
rules
of
conduct
and
liable
to
exactly
the
same
weaknesses
as
invade
the
rural
character
in
every
country
and
latitude
that
they
were
exhorted
to
behave
as
of
light
and
that
the
majority
of
them
sincerely
desired
to
do
credit
to
their
high
calling
could
not
prevent
their
being
beset
by
the
sins
which
had
affected
their
forebears
for
generations
past
the
addition
of
so
many
young
persons
of
each
sex
to
the
communion
led
to
an
entirely
new
class
of
embarrassment
now
there
arose
endless
difficulties
about
about
youthful
brethren
who
out
walking
with
even
more
youthful
sisters
glancing
over
my
father
notes
i
observe
the
ceaseless
repetition
of
cases
in
which
is
followed
by
the
melancholy
record
that
he
has
her
in
my
father
stern
language
would
very
often
mean
no
more
than
that
the
amatory
pair
had
blamelessly
changed
their
minds
but
in
some
cases
it
meant
more
and
worse
than
this
it
was
a
very
great
distress
to
him
that
sometimes
the
young
men
and
women
who
showed
the
most
lively
interest
in
scripture
and
who
had
apparently
accepted
the
way
of
salvation
with
the
fullest
intelligence
were
precisely
those
who
seemed
to
struggle
with
least
success
against
a
temptation
to
unchastity
he
put
this
down
to
the
concentrated
malignity
of
satan
who
directed
his
most
poisoned
darts
against
the
fairest
of
the
flock
in
addition
to
these
troubles
there
came
recriminations
mutual
charges
of
drunkenness
in
private
all
sorts
of
petty
jealousy
and
scandal
there
were
frequent
definite
acts
of
on
the
part
of
members
who
had
in
consequence
to
be
away
no
one
of
these
cases
might
be
in
itself
extremely
serious
but
when
many
of
them
came
together
they
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
church
was
in
an
unhealthy
condition
the
particulars
of
many
of
these
scandals
were
concealed
from
me
but
i
was
an
adroit
little
pitcher
and
had
cultivated
the
art
of
seeming
to
be
interested
in
something
else
a
book
or
a
flower
while
my
elders
were
talking
confidentially
as
a
rule
while
i
would
fain
have
acquired
more
details
i
was
fairly
about
the
errors
of
the
saints
although
i
was
often
quaintly
ignorant
of
the
real
nature
of
those
errors
not
infrequently
persons
who
had
fallen
into
sin
repented
of
it
under
my
father
penetrating
ministrations
they
were
apt
in
their
penitence
to
use
strange
symbolic
expressions
i
remember
pewings
our
washerwoman
who
had
been
accused
of
intemperance
and
had
been
suspended
from
communion
reappearing
with
a
face
that
shone
with
soap
and
sanctification
and
saying
to
me
blessed
child
you
wonderin
to
zee
old
pewings
here
again
but
he
have
rolled
away
my
mountain
for
once
i
was
absolutely
at
a
loss
but
she
meant
that
the
lord
had
removed
the
load
of
her
sins
and
restored
her
to
a
state
of
grace
it
was
in
consequence
of
these
backslidings
which
had
become
alarmingly
frequent
that
early
in
my
father
determined
on
proclaiming
a
solemn
fast
he
delivered
one
sunday
what
seemed
to
me
an
address
calling
upon
us
all
closely
to
examine
our
consciences
and
reminding
us
of
the
appalling
fate
of
the
church
of
laodicea
he
said
that
it
was
not
enough
to
have
made
a
satisfactory
confession
of
faith
nor
even
to
have
sealed
that
confession
in
baptism
if
we
did
not
live
up
to
our
protestations
salvation
he
told
us
must
indeed
precede
holiness
of
life
yet
both
are
essential
it
was
a
dark
and
rainy
winter
morning
when
he
made
this
terrible
address
which
frightened
the
congregation
extremely
when
the
marrow
was
congealed
within
our
bones
and
when
the
bowed
heads
before
him
and
the
faintly
audible
sobs
of
the
women
in
the
background
told
him
that
his
lesson
had
gone
home
he
pronounced
the
keeping
of
a
day
in
the
following
week
as
a
fast
of
contrition
of
you
who
have
to
pursue
your
daily
occupations
will
pursue
them
but
sustained
only
by
the
bread
of
affliction
and
by
the
water
of
affliction
his
influence
over
these
gentle
peasant
people
was
certainly
remarkable
for
no
effort
was
made
to
resist
his
exhortation
it
was
his
customary
plan
to
stay
a
little
while
after
the
morning
meeting
was
over
and
in
a
very
affable
fashion
to
shake
hands
with
the
saints
but
on
this
occasion
he
stalked
forth
without
a
word
holding
my
hand
tight
until
we
had
swept
out
into
the
street
how
the
rest
of
the
congregation
kept
this
fast
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
a
dreadful
day
for
us
i
was
awakened
in
the
pitchy
night
to
go
off
with
my
father
to
the
room
where
a
scanty
gathering
held
a
penitential
we
came
home
as
dawn
was
breaking
and
in
process
of
time
sat
down
to
breakfast
which
consisted
at
that
dismal
hour
of
slices
of
dry
bread
and
a
tumbler
of
cold
water
each
during
the
morning
i
was
not
allowed
to
paint
or
write
or
withdraw
to
my
study
in
the
room
we
sat
in
a
state
of
depression
not
to
be
described
in
the
reading
books
of
a
devotional
character
with
occasional
wailing
of
some
very
doleful
hymn
our
midday
dinner
came
at
last
the
meal
was
strictly
confined
as
before
to
dry
slices
of
the
loaf
and
a
tumbler
of
water
the
afternoon
would
have
been
spent
as
the
morning
was
and
so
my
father
spent
it
but
miss
marks
seeing
my
white
cheeks
and
the
dark
rings
around
my
eyes
besought
leave
to
take
me
out
for
a
walk
this
was
permitted
with
a
pledge
that
i
should
be
given
no
species
of
refreshment
although
i
told
miss
marks
in
the
course
of
the
walk
that
i
was
feeling
leer
our
devonshire
phrase
for
hungry
she
dared
not
break
her
word
our
last
meal
was
of
the
former
character
and
the
day
ended
by
our
trapesing
through
the
wet
to
another
whence
i
returned
in
a
state
bordering
on
collapse
and
was
put
to
bed
without
further
nourishment
there
was
no
great
hardship
in
all
this
i
daresay
but
it
was
certainly
rigorous
my
father
took
pains
to
see
that
what
he
had
said
about
the
bread
and
water
of
affliction
was
carried
out
in
the
bosom
of
his
own
family
and
by
no
one
more
unflinchingly
than
by
himself
my
attitude
to
other
people
souls
when
i
was
out
of
my
sight
was
now
a
constant
anxiety
to
me
in
our
tattling
world
of
small
things
he
had
extraordinary
opportunities
of
learning
how
i
behaved
when
i
was
away
from
home
i
did
not
realize
this
and
i
used
to
think
his
acquaintance
with
my
deeds
and
words
savoured
almost
of
wizardry
he
was
accustomed
to
urge
upon
me
the
necessity
of
for
jesus
in
season
and
out
of
season
and
he
so
worked
upon
my
feelings
that
i
would
start
forth
like
teresa
wild
for
the
moors
and
martyrdom
but
any
actual
impact
with
persons
marvelously
cooled
my
zeal
and
i
should
hardly
ever
have
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
unfortunate
phrase
of
season
it
really
seemed
that
one
must
talk
of
nothing
else
since
if
an
occasion
was
not
in
season
it
was
out
of
season
there
was
no
alternative
no
close
time
for
souls
my
father
was
very
generous
he
used
to
magnify
any
little
effort
that
i
made
with
stammering
tongue
to
sanctify
a
visit
and
people
i
now
see
were
accustomed
to
give
me
a
friendly
lead
in
this
direction
so
that
they
might
please
him
by
reporting
that
i
had
in
the
lord
service
the
whole
thing
however
was
artificial
and
was
part
of
my
father
restless
inability
to
let
well
alone
it
was
not
in
harshness
or
in
that
he
worried
me
so
much
on
the
contrary
it
was
all
part
of
his
anxious
love
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
see
me
become
a
shining
light
everything
that
he
had
himself
desired
to
be
yet
with
none
of
his
shortcomings
it
was
about
this
time
that
he
harrowed
my
whole
soul
into
painful
agitation
by
a
phrase
that
he
let
fall
without
i
believe
attaching
any
particular
importance
to
it
at
the
time
he
was
occupied
as
he
so
often
was
in
polishing
and
burnishing
my
faith
and
he
was
led
to
speak
of
the
day
when
i
should
ascend
the
pulpit
to
preach
my
first
sermon
if
i
may
be
there
out
of
sight
and
hear
the
gospel
message
proclaimed
from
your
lips
then
i
shall
say
my
poor
work
is
done
oh
lord
jesus
receive
my
spirit
i
can
not
express
the
dismay
which
this
aspiration
gave
me
the
horror
with
which
i
anticipated
such
a
nunc
dimittis
i
felt
like
a
small
and
solitary
bird
caught
and
hung
out
hopelessly
and
endlessly
in
a
great
glittering
cage
the
clearness
of
the
personal
image
affected
me
as
all
the
texts
and
prayers
and
predictions
had
failed
to
do
i
saw
myself
imprisoned
for
ever
in
the
religious
system
which
had
caught
me
and
would
whirl
my
helpless
spirit
as
in
the
concentric
wheels
of
my
nightly
vision
i
did
not
struggle
against
it
because
i
believed
that
it
was
inevitable
and
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
making
peace
with
the
terrible
and
who
is
a
jealous
god
but
i
looked
forward
to
my
fate
without
zeal
and
without
exhilaration
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
altogether
swallowed
up
and
cancelled
any
notion
of
the
love
of
him
i
should
do
myself
an
injustice
however
if
i
described
my
attitude
to
faith
at
this
time
as
wanting
in
candour
i
did
very
earnestly
desire
to
follow
where
my
father
led
that
passion
for
imitation
which
i
have
already
discussed
was
strongly
developed
at
this
time
and
it
induced
me
to
repeat
the
language
of
pious
books
in
godly
ejaculations
which
greatly
edified
my
companions
and
were
so
far
as
i
can
judge
perfectly
sincere
i
wished
extremely
to
be
good
and
holy
and
i
had
no
doubt
in
my
mind
of
the
absolute
infallibility
of
my
father
as
a
guide
in
heavenly
things
but
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
there
never
was
a
moment
in
which
my
heart
truly
responded
with
native
ardour
to
the
words
which
flowed
so
readily
in
such
a
stream
of
unction
from
my
anointed
lips
i
can
not
recall
anything
but
an
intellectual
surrender
there
was
never
joy
in
the
act
of
resignation
never
the
mystic
rapture
at
feeling
his
phantom
self
his
own
threadbare
soul
suffused
thrilled
through
robed
again
in
glory
by
a
fire
which
burns
up
everything
personal
and
individual
about
him
through
thick
and
thin
i
clung
to
a
hard
nut
of
individuality
deep
down
in
my
childish
nature
to
the
pressure
from
without
i
resigned
everything
else
my
thoughts
my
words
my
anticipations
my
assurances
but
there
was
something
which
i
never
resigned
my
innate
and
persistent
self
meek
as
i
seemed
and
gently
respondent
i
was
always
conscious
of
that
innermost
quality
which
i
had
learned
to
recognize
in
my
earlier
days
in
islington
that
existence
of
two
in
the
depths
who
could
speak
to
one
another
in
inviolable
secrecy
a
natural
man
may
discourse
of
and
that
very
knowingly
and
give
a
kind
of
natural
credit
to
it
as
to
a
history
that
may
be
true
but
firmly
to
believe
that
there
is
divine
truth
in
all
these
things
and
to
have
a
persuasion
of
it
stronger
than
of
the
very
thing
we
see
with
our
eyes
such
an
assent
as
this
is
the
peculiar
work
of
the
spirit
of
god
and
is
certainly
saving
faith
this
passage
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
any
extravagant
plymouth
brother
but
in
one
of
the
most
solid
classics
of
the
church
in
archbishop
leighton
on
the
first
epistle
of
i
quote
it
because
it
defines
more
exactly
than
words
of
my
own
could
hope
to
do
the
difference
which
already
existed
and
in
secrecy
began
forthwith
to
be
more
and
more
acutely
accentuated
between
my
father
and
myself
he
did
indeed
possess
this
saving
faith
which
could
move
mountains
of
evidence
and
suffer
no
diminution
under
the
action
of
failure
or
disappointment
i
on
the
other
hand
as
i
began
to
feel
dimly
then
and
see
luminously
now
had
only
acquired
the
habit
of
giving
what
the
archbishop
means
by
kind
of
natural
credit
to
the
doctrine
so
persistently
impressed
upon
my
conscience
from
its
very
nature
this
could
not
but
be
molten
in
the
dews
and
exhaled
in
the
sunshine
of
life
and
thought
and
experience
my
father
by
an
indulgent
act
for
the
caprice
of
which
i
can
not
wholly
account
presently
let
in
a
flood
of
imaginative
light
which
was
certainly
hostile
to
my
heavenly
calling
my
instinctive
interest
in
geography
has
already
been
mentioned
this
was
the
one
branch
of
knowledge
in
which
i
needed
no
instruction
geographical
information
seeming
to
soak
into
the
cells
of
my
brain
without
an
effort
at
the
age
of
eleven
i
knew
a
great
deal
more
of
maps
and
of
the
mutual
relation
of
localities
all
over
the
globe
than
most
people
do
it
was
almost
a
mechanical
acquirement
i
was
now
greatly
taken
with
the
geography
of
the
west
indies
of
every
part
of
which
i
had
made
maps
there
was
something
powerfully
attractive
to
my
fancy
in
the
great
chain
of
the
antilles
lying
on
the
sea
like
an
open
bracelet
with
its
big
jewels
and
little
jewels
strung
on
an
invisible
thread
i
liked
to
shut
my
eyes
and
see
it
all
in
a
mental
panorama
stretched
from
cape
sant
antonio
to
the
serpent
mouth
several
of
these
lovely
islands
these
emeralds
and
amethysts
set
on
the
caribbean
sea
my
father
had
known
well
in
his
youth
and
i
was
importunate
in
questioning
him
about
them
one
day
as
i
multiplied
inquiries
he
rose
in
his
impetuous
way
and
climbing
to
the
top
of
a
bookcase
brought
down
a
thick
volume
and
presented
it
to
me
find
all
about
the
antilles
there
he
said
and
left
me
with
cringle
in
my
possession
the
embargo
laid
upon
every
species
of
fiction
by
my
powerful
scruple
had
never
been
raised
although
she
had
been
dead
four
years
as
i
have
said
in
an
earlier
chapter
this
was
a
point
on
which
i
believe
that
my
father
had
never
entirely
agreed
with
her
he
had
however
yielded
to
her
prejudice
and
no
work
of
romance
no
fictitious
story
had
ever
come
in
my
way
it
is
remarkable
that
among
our
books
which
amounted
to
many
hundreds
i
had
never
discovered
a
single
work
of
fiction
until
my
father
himself
revealed
the
existence
of
michael
scott
wild
masterpiece
so
little
did
i
understand
what
was
allowable
in
the
way
of
literary
invention
that
i
began
the
story
without
a
doubt
that
it
was
true
and
i
think
it
was
my
father
himself
who
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
explained
to
me
that
it
was
made
up
he
advised
me
to
read
the
descriptions
of
the
sea
and
of
the
mountains
of
jamaica
and
the
pages
which
gave
imaginary
adventures
and
conversations
but
i
did
not
take
his
counsel
these
latter
were
the
flower
of
the
book
to
me
i
had
never
read
never
dreamed
of
anything
like
them
and
they
filled
my
whole
horizon
with
glory
and
with
joy
i
suppose
that
when
my
father
was
a
younger
man
and
less
pietistic
he
had
read
cringle
with
pleasure
because
it
recalled
familiar
scenes
to
him
much
was
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
frontispiece
of
this
edition
was
a
delicate
engraving
of
blewfields
the
great
lonely
house
in
a
garden
of
jamaican
where
for
eighteen
months
he
had
worked
as
a
naturalist
he
could
not
look
at
this
print
without
recalling
exquisite
memories
and
airs
that
blew
from
a
terrestrial
paradise
but
michael
scott
noisy
amorous
novel
of
adventure
was
an
extraordinary
book
to
put
in
the
hands
of
a
child
who
had
never
been
allowed
to
glance
at
the
mildest
and
most
febrifugal
it
was
like
giving
a
glass
of
brandy
neat
to
someone
who
had
never
been
weaned
from
a
milk
diet
i
have
not
read
from
that
day
to
this
and
i
think
that
i
should
be
unwilling
now
to
break
the
charm
of
memory
which
may
be
largely
illusion
but
i
remember
a
great
deal
of
the
plot
and
not
a
little
of
the
language
and
while
i
am
sure
it
is
enchantingly
spirited
i
am
quite
as
sure
that
the
persons
it
describes
were
far
from
being
unspotted
by
the
world
the
scenes
at
night
in
the
streets
of
spanish
town
surpassed
not
merely
my
experience
but
thank
goodness
my
imagination
the
nautical
personages
used
in
their
conversations
what
is
called
class
of
language
and
there
ran
if
i
am
not
mistaken
a
glow
and
gust
of
life
through
the
romance
from
beginning
to
end
which
was
nothing
if
it
was
not
resolutely
pagan
there
were
certain
scenes
and
images
in
cringle
which
made
not
merely
a
lasting
impression
upon
my
mind
but
tinged
my
outlook
upon
life
the
long
adventures
fightings
and
escapes
sudden
storms
without
and
mutinies
within
drawn
forth
as
they
were
surely
with
great
skill
upon
the
fiery
blue
of
the
boundless
tropical
ocean
produced
on
my
inner
mind
a
sort
of
glimmering
hope
very
vaguely
felt
at
first
slowly
developing
long
stationary
and
faint
but
always
tending
towards
a
belief
that
i
should
escape
at
last
from
the
narrowness
of
the
life
we
led
at
home
from
this
bondage
to
the
law
and
the
prophets
i
must
not
define
too
clearly
nor
endeavour
too
formally
to
insist
on
the
blind
movements
of
a
childish
mind
but
of
this
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
reading
and
of
did
more
than
anything
else
in
this
critical
eleventh
year
of
my
life
to
give
fortitude
to
my
individuality
which
was
in
great
danger
as
i
now
see
of
succumbing
to
the
pressure
my
father
brought
to
bear
upon
it
from
all
sides
my
soul
was
shut
up
like
fatima
in
a
tower
to
which
no
external
influences
could
come
and
it
might
really
have
been
starved
to
death
or
have
lost
the
power
of
recovery
and
rebound
if
my
captor
by
some
freak
not
yet
perfectly
accounted
for
had
not
gratuitously
opened
a
little
window
in
it
and
added
a
powerful
telescope
the
daring
chapters
of
michael
scott
picaresque
romance
of
the
tropics
were
that
telescope
and
that
window
in
the
spring
of
this
year
i
began
to
walk
about
the
village
and
even
proceed
for
considerable
distances
into
the
country
by
myself
and
after
reading
cringle
those
expeditions
were
accompanied
by
a
constant
hope
of
meeting
with
some
adventures
i
did
not
court
events
however
except
in
fancy
for
i
was
very
shy
of
real
people
and
would
break
off
some
gallant
dream
of
prowess
on
the
high
seas
to
bolt
into
a
field
and
hide
behind
the
hedge
while
a
couple
of
labouring
men
went
by
sometimes
however
the
wave
of
a
great
purpose
would
bear
me
on
as
when
once
but
certainly
at
an
earlier
date
than
i
have
now
reached
hearing
the
dangers
of
a
persistent
drought
much
dwelt
upon
i
carried
my
small
red
watering
pot
full
of
water
up
to
the
top
of
the
village
and
then
all
the
way
down
petittor
lane
and
discharged
its
contents
in
a
cornfield
hoping
by
this
act
to
improve
the
prospects
of
the
harvest
a
more
eventful
excursion
must
be
described
because
of
the
moral
impression
it
left
indelibly
upon
me
i
have
described
the
sequestered
and
beautiful
hamlet
of
barton
to
which
i
was
so
often
taken
visiting
by
mary
grace
burmington
at
barton
there
lived
a
couple
who
were
objects
of
peculiar
interest
to
me
because
of
the
rather
odd
fact
that
having
come
out
of
pure
curiosity
to
see
me
baptized
they
had
been
then
and
there
deeply
convinced
of
their
spiritual
danger
these
were
john
brooks
an
irish
quarryman
and
his
wife
ann
brooks
these
people
had
not
merely
been
hitherto
unconverted
but
they
had
openly
treated
the
brethren
with
anger
and
contempt
they
came
indeed
to
my
baptism
to
mock
but
they
went
away
impressed
next
morning
when
brooks
was
at
the
wash
tub
as
she
told
us
hell
opened
at
her
feet
and
the
devil
came
out
holding
a
long
scroll
on
which
the
list
of
her
sins
was
written
she
was
so
much
excited
that
the
motion
brought
about
a
miscarriage
and
she
was
seriously
ill
meanwhile
her
husband
who
had
been
equally
moved
at
the
baptism
was
also
converted
and
as
soon
as
she
was
well
enough
they
were
baptized
together
and
then
with
us
the
case
of
the
brookses
was
much
talked
about
and
was
attributed
in
a
distant
sense
to
me
that
is
to
say
if
i
had
not
been
an
object
of
public
curiosity
the
brookses
might
have
remained
in
the
bond
of
iniquity
i
therefore
took
a
very
particular
interest
in
them
and
as
i
presently
heard
that
they
were
extremely
poor
i
was
filled
with
a
fervent
longing
to
minister
to
their
necessities
somebody
had
lately
given
me
a
present
of
money
and
i
begged
little
sums
here
and
there
until
i
reached
the
very
considerable
figure
of
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
with
these
coins
safe
in
a
little
linen
bag
i
started
one
sunday
afternoon
without
saying
anything
to
anyone
and
i
arrived
at
the
brookses
cottage
in
barton
john
brooks
was
a
heavy
dirty
man
with
a
face
and
two
left
legs
his
broad
and
red
face
carried
small
in
the
manner
of
that
day
but
was
otherwise
shaved
when
i
reached
the
cottage
husband
and
wife
were
at
home
doing
nothing
at
all
in
the
approved
sunday
style
i
was
received
by
them
with
some
surprise
but
i
quickly
explained
my
mission
and
produced
my
linen
bag
to
my
disgust
all
john
brooks
said
was
know
the
lord
would
provide
and
after
emptying
my
little
bag
into
the
palm
of
an
enormous
hand
he
swept
the
contents
into
his
trousers
pocket
and
slapped
his
leg
he
said
not
one
single
word
of
thanks
or
appreciation
and
i
was
absolutely
cut
to
the
heart
i
think
that
in
the
course
of
a
long
life
i
have
never
experienced
a
bitterer
disappointment
the
woman
who
was
quicker
and
more
sensitive
doubtless
saw
my
embarrassment
but
the
form
of
comfort
which
she
chose
was
even
more
wounding
to
my
pride
mind
little
master
she
said
shall
come
and
see
me
feed
the
pigs
but
there
is
a
limit
to
endurance
and
with
a
sense
of
having
been
cruelly
torn
by
the
tooth
of
ingratitude
i
fled
from
the
threshold
of
the
brookses
never
to
return
at
tea
that
afternoon
i
was
very
much
downcast
and
under
examination
from
miss
marks
all
my
little
story
came
out
my
father
who
had
been
floating
away
in
a
meditation
as
he
very
often
did
caught
a
word
that
interested
him
and
descended
to
consciousness
i
had
to
tell
my
tale
over
again
this
time
very
sadly
and
with
a
fear
that
i
should
be
reprimanded
but
on
the
contrary
both
my
father
and
miss
marks
were
attentive
and
most
sympathetic
and
i
was
much
comforted
must
remember
they
are
the
lord
children
said
my
father
the
lord
ca
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
said
miss
marks
who
was
considerably
ruffled
alas
replied
my
father
waving
his
hand
with
a
deprecating
gesture
dear
child
said
miss
marks
bristling
with
indignation
and
patting
my
hand
across
the
lord
will
reward
your
zealous
loving
care
of
his
poor
even
if
they
have
neither
the
grace
nor
the
knowledge
to
thank
you
said
my
father
and
rested
his
brown
eyes
meltingly
upon
me
said
miss
marks
thinking
of
john
and
ann
brooks
no
no
replied
my
father
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
we
must
bear
with
the
limited
intelligence
all
this
was
an
emollient
to
my
wounds
and
i
became
consoled
but
the
springs
of
benevolence
were
dried
up
within
me
and
to
this
day
i
have
never
entirely
recovered
from
the
shock
of
john
brooks
coarse
leer
and
his
know
the
lord
would
provide
the
infant
plant
of
philanthropy
was
burned
in
my
bosom
as
if
by
in
the
course
of
the
summer
a
young
schoolmaster
called
on
my
father
to
announce
to
him
that
he
had
just
opened
a
for
the
sons
of
gentlemen
in
our
vicinity
and
he
begged
for
the
favour
of
a
visit
my
father
returned
his
call
he
lived
in
one
of
the
small
white
villas
buried
in
laurels
which
gave
a
discreet
animation
to
our
neighbourhood
was
frank
and
modest
deferential
to
my
father
opinions
and
yet
capable
of
defending
his
own
his
school
and
he
produced
an
excellent
impression
and
in
august
i
began
to
be
one
of
his
pupils
the
school
was
very
informal
it
was
held
in
the
two
principal
on
the
of
the
villa
and
i
do
not
remember
that
had
any
help
from
an
usher
there
were
perhaps
twenty
boys
in
the
school
at
most
and
often
fewer
i
made
the
excursion
between
home
and
school
four
times
a
day
if
i
walked
fast
the
transit
might
take
five
minutes
and
as
there
were
several
objects
of
interest
in
the
way
it
might
be
spread
over
an
hour
in
fine
weather
the
going
to
and
from
school
was
very
delightful
and
small
as
the
scope
of
it
was
it
could
be
varied
almost
indefinitely
i
would
sometimes
meet
with
a
schoolfellow
proceeding
in
the
same
direction
and
my
father
observing
us
over
the
wall
one
morning
was
amused
to
notice
that
i
always
progressed
by
dancing
along
the
curbstone
sideways
my
face
turned
inwards
and
my
arms
beating
against
my
legs
conversing
loudly
all
the
time
this
was
a
case
of
pure
heredity
for
so
he
used
to
go
to
his
school
forty
years
before
along
the
streets
of
poole
one
day
when
fortunately
i
was
alone
i
was
accosted
by
an
old
gentleman
dressed
as
a
dissenting
minister
he
was
pleased
with
my
replies
and
he
presently
made
it
a
habit
to
be
taking
his
constitutional
when
i
was
likely
to
be
on
the
high
road
we
became
great
friends
and
he
took
me
at
last
to
his
house
a
very
modest
place
where
to
my
great
amazement
there
hung
in
the
two
large
portraits
one
of
a
man
the
other
of
a
woman
in
extravagant
my
old
friend
told
me
that
the
former
was
a
picture
of
himself
as
he
had
appeared
ago
in
my
unconverted
days
on
the
stage
i
was
so
ignorant
as
not
to
have
the
slightest
conception
of
what
was
meant
by
the
stage
and
he
explained
to
me
that
he
had
been
an
actor
and
a
poet
before
the
lord
had
opened
his
eyes
to
better
things
i
knew
nothing
about
actors
but
poets
were
already
the
objects
of
my
veneration
my
friend
was
the
first
poet
i
had
ever
seen
he
was
no
less
a
person
than
james
sheridan
knowles
the
famous
author
of
and
who
had
become
a
baptist
minister
in
his
old
age
when
at
home
i
mentioned
this
acquaintance
it
awakened
no
interest
i
believe
that
my
father
had
never
heard
or
never
noticed
the
name
of
one
who
had
been
by
far
the
most
eminent
english
playwright
of
that
age
it
was
from
sheridan
knowles
lips
that
i
first
heard
fall
the
name
of
shakespeare
he
was
surprised
i
fancy
to
find
me
so
curiously
advanced
in
some
branches
of
knowledge
and
so
utterly
ignorant
of
others
he
could
hardly
credit
that
the
names
of
hamlet
and
falstaff
and
prospero
meant
nothing
to
a
little
boy
who
knew
so
much
theology
and
geography
as
i
did
knowles
suggested
that
i
should
ask
my
schoolmaster
to
read
some
of
the
plays
of
shakespeare
with
the
boys
and
he
proposed
merchant
of
as
particularly
for
this
purpose
i
repeated
what
my
aged
friend
sheridan
knowles
must
have
been
nearly
eighty
at
that
time
had
said
and
accepted
the
idea
with
promptitude
all
my
memories
of
this
my
earliest
schoolmaster
present
him
to
me
as
intelligent
amiable
and
quick
although
i
think
not
very
soundly
prepared
for
his
profession
accordingly
it
was
announced
that
the
reading
of
shakespeare
would
be
one
of
our
lessons
and
on
the
following
afternoon
we
began
merchant
of
there
was
one
large
volume
and
it
was
handed
about
the
class
i
was
permitted
to
read
the
part
of
bassanio
and
i
set
forth
with
ecstatic
pipe
how
in
belmont
is
a
lady
richly
left
and
she
is
fair
and
fairer
than
that
word
must
have
had
some
fondness
for
the
stage
himself
his
pleasure
in
the
shakespeare
scenes
was
obvious
and
nothing
else
that
he
taught
me
made
so
much
impression
on
me
as
what
he
said
about
a
proper
emphasis
in
reading
aloud
i
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
but
alas
we
had
only
reached
the
second
act
of
the
play
when
the
readings
mysteriously
stopped
i
never
knew
the
cause
but
i
suspect
that
it
was
at
my
father
desire
he
prided
himself
on
never
having
read
a
page
of
shakespeare
and
on
never
having
entered
a
theatre
but
once
i
think
i
must
have
spoken
at
home
about
the
readings
and
that
he
must
have
given
the
schoolmaster
a
hint
to
return
to
the
ordinary
school
curriculum
the
fact
that
i
was
believer
as
it
was
our
custom
to
call
one
who
had
been
admitted
to
the
arcana
of
our
religion
and
that
therefore
in
all
commerce
with
it
was
my
duty
to
be
for
my
lord
in
season
and
out
of
season
this
prevented
my
forming
any
intimate
friendships
at
my
first
school
i
shrank
from
the
toilsome
and
embarrassing
act
of
a
schoolfellow
as
he
rushed
out
of
class
and
of
pressing
upon
him
the
probably
unintelligible
question
you
found
jesus
it
was
simpler
to
avoid
him
to
slip
like
a
lizard
though
the
laurels
and
emerge
into
solitude
the
boys
had
a
way
of
plunging
out
into
the
road
in
front
of
the
when
afternoon
school
was
over
it
was
a
pleasant
rural
road
lined
with
high
hedges
and
shadowed
by
here
especially
towards
the
summer
twilight
they
used
to
linger
and
play
vague
games
swooping
and
whirling
in
the
declining
sunshine
and
i
was
glad
to
join
these
sports
but
my
company
though
not
avoided
was
not
greatly
sought
for
i
think
that
something
of
my
curious
history
was
known
and
that
i
was
not
unkindly
but
instinctively
avoided
as
an
animal
of
a
different
species
not
allied
to
the
herd
the
conventionality
of
little
boys
is
constant
the
colour
of
their
traditions
is
uniform
at
the
same
time
although
i
made
no
friends
i
found
no
enemies
in
class
except
in
my
extraordinary
aptitude
for
geography
which
was
looked
upon
as
incomprehensible
and
almost
uncanny
i
was
rather
behind
than
in
front
of
the
others
i
therefore
awakened
no
jealousies
and
intent
on
my
own
dreams
i
think
my
little
shadowy
presence
escaped
the
notice
of
most
of
my
schoolfellows
by
the
side
of
the
road
i
have
mentioned
between
the
school
and
my
home
there
was
a
large
the
hedge
folded
around
three
sides
of
it
while
ancient
pollard
elms
bent
over
it
and
chequered
with
their
foliage
in
it
the
reflection
of
the
sky
the
roadside
edge
of
this
pond
was
my
favourite
station
it
consisted
of
a
hard
clay
which
could
be
moulded
into
fairly
tenacious
forms
here
i
created
a
maritime
empire
islands
a
seaboard
with
harbours
fortifications
my
geographical
imitativeness
had
its
full
swing
sometimes
while
i
was
creating
a
cart
would
be
driven
roughly
into
the
pond
and
a
horse
would
drink
deep
of
my
ocean
his
hooves
trampling
my
archipelagoes
and
shattering
my
ports
with
what
was
worse
than
a
typhoon
but
i
immediately
set
to
work
as
soon
as
the
cart
was
gone
and
the
mud
had
settled
to
tidy
up
my
coastline
again
and
to
scoop
out
anew
my
harbours
my
pleasure
in
this
sport
was
endless
and
what
i
was
able
to
see
in
my
mind
eye
was
not
the
edge
of
a
morass
of
mud
but
a
splendid
line
of
coast
and
gulfs
of
the
type
of
tor
bay
i
do
not
recollect
a
sharper
double
humiliation
than
when
old
sam
lamble
the
blacksmith
who
was
one
of
the
being
asked
by
my
father
whether
he
had
met
me
replied
i
zeed
long
making
mud
pies
in
the
what
a
position
for
one
who
had
been
received
into
communion
an
adult
what
a
blot
on
the
scutcheon
of
a
columbus
indeed
yet
i
had
an
appreciator
one
afternoon
as
i
was
busy
on
my
geographical
operations
a
lady
with
a
soft
pink
cheek
and
a
sparkling
hazel
eye
paused
and
asked
me
if
my
name
was
not
what
it
was
i
had
seen
her
before
a
stranger
to
our
parts
with
a
voice
without
a
trace
in
it
of
the
devonshire
drawl
i
knew
dimly
that
she
came
sometimes
to
the
meeting
that
she
was
lodging
at
upton
with
some
friends
of
ours
who
accepted
paying
guests
in
an
old
house
that
was
simply
a
basket
of
roses
she
was
miss
brightwen
and
i
now
conversed
with
her
for
the
first
time
her
interest
in
my
harbours
and
islands
was
marked
she
did
not
smile
she
asked
questions
about
my
peninsulas
which
were
intelligent
and
pertinent
i
was
even
persuaded
at
last
to
leave
my
creations
and
to
walk
with
her
towards
the
village
i
was
pleased
with
her
voice
her
refinements
her
dress
which
was
more
delicate
and
her
manners
which
were
more
easy
than
what
i
was
accustomed
to
we
had
some
very
pleasant
conversation
and
when
we
parted
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
our
intercourse
had
been
both
agreeable
to
me
and
instructive
to
her
i
told
her
that
i
should
be
glad
to
tell
her
more
on
a
future
occasion
she
thanked
me
very
gravely
and
then
she
laughed
a
little
i
confess
i
did
not
see
that
there
was
anything
to
laugh
at
we
parted
on
warm
terms
of
mutual
esteem
but
i
little
thought
that
this
sympathetic
quakerish
lady
was
to
become
my
mother
chapter
x
i
slept
in
a
little
bed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
my
father
in
the
ancestral
nearer
to
the
door
very
early
one
bright
september
morning
at
the
close
of
my
eleventh
year
my
father
called
me
over
to
him
i
climbed
up
and
was
snugly
wrapped
in
the
coverlid
and
then
we
held
a
momentous
conversation
it
began
abruptly
by
his
asking
me
whether
i
should
like
to
have
a
new
mamma
i
was
never
a
sentimentalist
and
i
therefore
answered
cannily
that
that
would
depend
on
who
she
was
he
parried
this
and
announced
that
anyway
a
new
mamma
was
coming
i
was
sure
to
like
her
still
in
a
noncommittal
mood
i
asked
she
go
with
me
to
the
back
of
the
this
question
caused
my
father
a
great
bewilderment
i
had
to
explain
that
the
ambition
of
my
life
was
to
go
up
behind
the
on
the
top
of
the
hill
that
hung
over
barton
a
spot
which
was
forbidden
ground
being
locally
held
one
of
extreme
danger
i
daresay
she
will
my
father
then
said
you
must
guess
who
she
is
i
guessed
one
or
two
of
the
less
comely
of
the
female
and
this
embarrassing
my
father
since
the
second
i
mentioned
was
a
married
woman
who
kept
a
in
the
village
he
cut
my
inquiries
short
by
saying
is
miss
brightwen
so
far
so
good
and
i
was
well
pleased
but
unfortunately
i
remembered
that
it
was
my
duty
to
testify
season
and
out
of
season
i
therefore
asked
with
much
earnestness
papa
is
she
one
of
the
lord
children
he
replied
with
gravity
that
she
was
she
taken
up
her
cross
in
baptism
i
went
on
for
this
was
my
own
strong
point
as
a
believer
my
father
looked
a
little
and
replied
she
has
not
as
yet
seen
the
necessity
of
that
but
we
must
pray
that
the
lord
may
make
her
way
clear
before
her
you
see
she
has
been
brought
up
hitherto
in
the
church
of
england
our
positions
were
now
curiously
changed
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
i
who
was
the
jealous
monitor
and
my
father
the
deprecating
penitent
i
sat
up
in
the
coverlid
and
i
shook
a
finger
at
him
i
said
tell
me
that
she
a
pedobaptist
i
had
lately
acquired
that
valuable
word
and
i
seized
this
remarkable
opportunity
of
using
it
it
affected
my
father
painfully
but
he
repeated
his
assurance
that
if
we
united
our
prayers
and
set
the
scripture
plan
plainly
before
miss
brightwen
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
she
would
see
her
way
to
accepting
the
doctrine
of
adult
baptism
and
he
said
we
must
judge
not
lest
we
ourselves
bejudged
i
had
just
enough
tact
to
let
that
pass
but
i
was
quite
aware
that
our
whole
system
was
one
of
judging
and
that
we
had
no
intention
whatever
of
being
judged
ourselves
yet
even
at
the
age
of
eleven
one
sees
that
on
certain
occasions
to
press
home
the
truth
is
not
convenient
just
before
christmas
on
a
piercing
night
of
frost
my
father
brought
to
us
his
bride
the
smartening
up
of
the
house
the
new
furniture
the
removal
of
my
own
possessions
to
a
private
bedroom
the
of
the
all
these
things
paled
in
interest
before
the
fact
that
miss
marks
had
a
scene
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
i
was
dancing
about
the
and
was
saying
i
am
so
glad
my
new
mamma
is
coming
when
miss
marks
called
out
in
an
unnatural
voice
you
cruel
child
i
stopped
in
amazement
and
stared
at
her
whereupon
she
threw
prudence
to
the
winds
and
moaned
once
thought
i
should
be
your
dear
mamma
i
was
simply
stupefied
and
i
expressed
my
horror
in
terms
that
were
clear
and
strong
thereupon
miss
marks
had
a
wild
fit
of
hysterics
while
i
looked
on
wholly
unsympathetic
and
still
deeply
affronted
she
was
right
i
was
cruel
alas
but
then
what
a
silly
woman
she
had
been
the
consequence
was
that
she
withdrew
in
a
moist
and
quivering
condition
to
her
boudoir
where
she
had
locked
herself
in
when
i
all
smiles
and
caresses
was
welcoming
the
bride
and
bridegroom
on
the
doorstep
as
politely
as
if
i
had
been
a
valued
old
family
retainer
my
stepmother
immediately
became
a
great
ally
of
mine
she
was
never
a
tower
of
strength
to
me
but
at
least
she
was
always
a
lodge
in
my
garden
of
cucumbers
she
was
a
very
pious
lady
but
she
was
not
a
fanatic
and
her
mind
did
not
naturally
revel
in
spiritual
aspirations
almost
her
only
social
fault
was
that
she
was
sometimes
a
little
fretful
this
was
the
way
in
which
her
bruised
individuality
asserted
itself
but
she
was
affectionate
serene
and
above
all
refined
her
refinement
was
extraordinarily
pleasant
to
my
nerves
on
which
much
else
in
our
surroundings
jarred
how
life
may
have
jarred
poor
insulated
lady
on
her
during
her
first
experience
of
our
life
at
the
room
i
know
not
but
i
think
she
was
a
philosopher
she
had
with
surprising
rashness
and
in
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
every
member
of
her
own
family
taken
her
cake
and
now
she
recognized
that
she
must
eat
it
to
the
last
crumb
over
her
wishes
and
prejudices
my
father
exercised
a
constant
cheerful
and
quiet
pressure
he
was
never
unkind
or
abrupt
but
he
went
on
adding
avoirdupois
until
her
will
gave
way
under
the
sheer
weight
even
to
public
immersion
which
as
was
natural
in
a
shy
and
sensitive
lady
of
advancing
years
she
regarded
with
a
horror
which
was
long
insurmountable
even
to
baptism
she
yielded
and
my
father
had
the
joy
to
announce
to
the
saints
one
sunday
morning
at
the
breaking
of
bread
that
beloved
wife
has
been
able
at
length
to
see
the
lord
will
in
the
matter
of
baptism
and
will
testify
to
the
faith
which
is
in
her
on
thursday
evening
next
no
wonder
my
stepmother
was
sometimes
fretful
on
the
physical
side
i
owe
her
an
endless
debt
of
gratitude
her
relations
who
objected
strongly
to
her
marriage
had
told
her
among
other
pleasant
prophecies
that
first
thing
you
will
have
to
do
will
be
to
bury
that
poor
child
under
the
sway
of
miss
marks
i
had
slept
beneath
a
load
of
blankets
had
never
gone
out
save
weighted
with
great
coat
and
comforter
and
had
been
protected
from
fresh
air
as
if
from
a
pestilence
with
real
courage
my
stepmother
reversed
all
this
my
bedroom
window
stood
wide
open
all
night
long
wraps
were
done
away
with
or
exchanged
for
flannel
garments
next
the
skin
and
i
was
urged
to
be
out
and
about
as
much
as
possible
all
the
quidnuncs
among
the
shook
their
heads
mary
grace
burmington
a
little
embittered
by
the
downfall
of
her
marks
made
a
solemn
remonstrance
to
my
father
who
however
allowed
my
stepmother
to
carry
out
her
excellent
plan
my
health
responded
rapidly
to
this
change
of
regime
but
increase
of
health
did
not
bring
increase
of
spirituality
my
father
fully
occupied
with
moulding
the
will
and
inflaming
the
piety
of
my
stepmother
left
me
now
to
a
degree
not
precedented
in
undisturbed
possession
of
my
own
devices
i
did
not
lose
my
faith
but
many
other
things
took
a
prominent
place
in
my
mind
it
will
i
suppose
be
admitted
that
there
is
no
greater
proof
of
complete
religious
sincerity
than
fervour
in
private
prayer
if
an
individual
alone
by
the
side
of
his
bed
prolongs
his
intercessions
lingers
wrestling
with
his
divine
companion
and
will
not
leave
off
until
he
has
what
he
believes
to
be
evidence
of
a
reply
to
his
entreaties
then
no
matter
what
the
character
of
his
public
protestations
or
what
the
frailty
of
his
actions
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
he
believes
in
what
he
professes
my
father
prayed
in
private
in
what
i
may
almost
call
a
spirit
of
violence
he
entreated
for
spiritual
guidance
with
nothing
less
than
importunity
it
might
be
said
that
he
stormed
the
citadels
of
god
grace
refusing
to
be
baffled
urging
his
intercessions
without
mercy
upon
a
deity
who
sometimes
struck
me
as
inattentive
to
his
prayers
or
wearied
by
them
my
father
acts
of
supplication
as
i
used
to
witness
them
at
night
when
i
was
supposed
to
be
asleep
were
accompanied
by
stretchings
out
of
the
hands
by
crackings
of
the
joints
of
the
fingers
by
deep
breathings
by
murmurous
sounds
which
seemed
just
breaking
out
of
silence
like
virgil
bees
out
of
the
hive
clamoribus
my
father
fortified
his
religious
life
by
prayer
as
an
athlete
does
his
physical
life
by
and
vigorous
rubbings
it
was
a
trouble
to
my
conscience
that
i
could
not
emulate
this
fervour
the
poverty
of
my
prayers
had
now
long
been
a
source
of
distress
to
me
but
i
could
not
discover
how
to
enrich
them
my
father
used
to
warn
us
very
solemnly
against
by
which
he
meant
singing
hymns
of
experience
and
joining
in
ministrations
in
which
our
hearts
took
no
vital
or
personal
part
this
was
an
outward
act
the
tendency
of
which
i
could
well
appreciate
but
there
was
a
even
more
deadly
than
that
against
which
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
warn
me
it
assailed
me
when
i
had
come
alone
by
my
bedside
and
had
blown
out
the
candle
and
had
sunken
on
my
knees
in
my
then
it
was
that
my
deadness
made
itself
felt
in
the
mechanical
address
i
put
up
the
emptiness
of
my
language
the
absence
of
all
real
unction
i
never
could
contrive
to
ask
god
for
spiritual
gifts
in
the
same
voice
and
spirit
in
which
i
could
ask
a
human
being
for
objects
which
i
knew
he
could
give
me
and
which
i
earnestly
desired
to
possess
that
sense
of
the
reality
of
intercession
was
for
ever
denied
me
and
it
was
i
now
see
the
stigma
of
my
want
of
faith
but
at
the
time
of
course
i
suspected
nothing
of
the
kind
and
i
tried
to
keep
up
my
zeal
by
a
desperate
mental
flogging
as
if
my
soul
had
been
a
in
nothing
did
i
gain
from
the
advent
of
my
stepmother
more
than
in
the
encouragement
she
gave
to
my
friendships
with
a
group
of
boys
of
my
own
age
of
whom
i
had
now
lately
formed
the
acquaintance
these
friendships
she
not
merely
tolerated
but
fostered
it
was
even
due
to
her
kind
arrangements
that
they
took
a
certain
set
form
that
our
excursions
started
from
this
house
or
from
that
on
regular
days
i
hardly
know
by
what
stages
i
ceased
to
be
a
lonely
little
creature
of
and
pies
and
became
a
member
of
a
sort
of
club
of
eight
or
ten
active
boys
the
long
summer
holidays
of
were
set
in
an
enchanting
brightness
looking
back
i
can
not
see
a
cloud
on
the
terrestrial
horizon
i
see
nothing
but
a
blaze
of
sunshine
descents
of
slippery
grass
to
moons
of
shingle
cold
to
the
bare
flesh
red
promontories
running
out
into
a
sea
that
was
like
sapphire
and
our
happy
clan
climbing
bathing
boating
lounging
chattering
all
the
hot
day
through
once
more
i
have
to
record
the
fact
which
i
think
is
not
without
interest
that
precisely
as
my
life
ceases
to
be
solitary
it
ceases
to
be
distinct
i
have
no
difficulty
in
recalling
with
the
minuteness
of
a
photograph
scenes
in
which
my
father
and
i
were
the
sole
actors
within
the
four
walls
of
a
room
but
of
the
glorious
life
among
wild
boys
on
the
margin
of
the
sea
i
have
nothing
but
vague
and
broken
impressions
delicious
and
illusive
it
was
a
remarkable
proof
of
my
father
temporary
lapse
into
indulgence
that
he
made
no
effort
to
thwart
my
intimacy
with
these
my
new
companions
he
was
in
an
unusually
humane
mood
himself
his
marriage
was
one
proof
of
it
another
was
the
composition
at
this
time
of
the
most
picturesque
easy
and
graceful
of
all
his
writings
romance
of
natural
even
now
a
sort
of
classic
everything
combined
to
make
him
believe
that
the
blessing
of
the
lord
was
upon
him
and
to
clothe
the
darkness
of
the
world
with
at
least
a
mist
of
i
do
not
recollect
that
ever
at
this
time
he
bethought
him
when
i
started
in
the
morning
for
a
long
day
with
my
friends
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
to
remind
me
that
i
must
speak
to
them
in
season
and
out
of
season
of
the
blood
of
jesus
and
i
young
coward
that
i
was
let
sleeping
dogmas
lie
my
companions
were
not
all
of
them
the
sons
of
saints
in
our
communion
their
parents
belonged
to
that
professional
class
which
we
were
only
now
beginning
to
attract
to
our
services
they
were
brought
up
in
religious
but
not
in
fanatical
families
and
i
was
the
only
one
among
them
paget
of
whom
i
shall
have
presently
to
speak
characteristically
said
that
it
grieved
her
to
see
lamb
among
so
many
kids
but
is
a
word
of
varied
significance
and
the
symbol
did
not
seem
to
us
effectively
applied
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
made
what
i
still
feel
was
an
excellent
tacit
compromise
my
young
companions
never
jeered
at
me
for
being
communion
with
the
saints
and
i
on
my
part
never
urged
the
atonement
upon
them
i
began
in
fact
more
and
more
to
keep
my
own
religion
for
use
on
sundays
it
will
i
hope
have
been
observed
that
among
the
very
curious
people
into
whose
company
i
was
thrown
although
many
were
frail
and
some
were
foolish
none
so
far
as
i
can
discern
were
hypocritical
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
believe
that
hypocrisy
is
a
vice
that
grows
on
every
bush
of
course
in
religious
more
than
in
any
other
matters
there
is
a
perpetual
contradiction
between
our
thoughts
and
our
deeds
which
is
inevitable
to
our
social
order
and
is
bound
to
lead
to
tromperie
of
which
pascal
speaks
but
i
have
often
wondered
while
admiring
the
splendid
portrait
of
tartuffe
whether
such
a
monster
ever
or
at
least
often
has
walked
the
stage
of
life
whether
moliere
observed
or
only
invented
him
to
adopt
a
scheme
of
religious
pretension
with
no
belief
whatever
in
its
being
true
merely
for
sensuous
advantage
openly
acknowledging
to
one
inner
self
the
brazen
system
of
deceit
such
a
course
may
and
doubtless
has
been
trodden
yet
surely
much
less
frequently
than
cynics
love
to
suggest
but
at
the
juncture
which
i
have
now
reached
in
my
narrative
i
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
a
person
who
was
branded
before
the
whole
world
and
punished
by
the
law
of
his
country
as
a
felonious
hypocrite
my
father
himself
could
only
sigh
and
admit
the
charge
and
yet
i
doubt
about
between
our
village
and
the
town
there
lay
a
comfortable
villa
inhabited
by
a
retired
solicitor
or
perhaps
attorney
whom
i
shall
name
dormant
we
often
called
at
his
house
and
although
he
was
a
member
of
the
meeting
he
not
unfrequently
came
up
to
us
for
breaking
of
bread
dormant
was
a
solid
pink
man
of
a
cosy
habit
he
had
beautiful
white
hair
a
very
soft
voice
and
a
welcoming
wheedling
manner
he
was
extremely
fluent
and
zealous
in
using
the
pious
phraseology
of
the
sect
my
father
had
never
been
very
much
attracted
to
him
but
the
man
professed
and
i
think
felt
an
overwhelming
admiration
for
my
father
dormant
was
not
very
well
off
and
in
the
previous
year
he
had
persuaded
an
aged
gentleman
of
wealth
to
come
and
board
with
him
when
in
the
course
of
the
winter
this
gentleman
died
much
surprise
was
felt
at
the
report
that
he
had
left
almost
his
entire
fortune
which
was
not
inconsiderable
to
dormant
much
surprise
for
the
old
gentleman
had
a
son
to
whom
he
had
always
been
warmly
attached
who
was
far
away
i
think
in
south
america
practising
a
perfectly
respectable
profession
of
which
his
father
entirely
approved
my
own
father
always
preserved
a
delicacy
and
a
sense
of
honour
about
money
which
could
not
have
been
more
sensitive
if
he
had
been
an
ungodly
man
and
i
am
very
much
pleased
to
remember
that
when
the
legacy
was
first
spoken
of
he
regretted
that
dormant
should
have
allowed
the
old
gentleman
to
make
this
will
if
he
knew
the
intention
my
father
said
it
would
have
shown
a
more
proper
sense
of
his
responsibility
if
he
had
dissuaded
the
testator
from
so
unbecoming
a
disposition
that
was
long
before
any
legal
question
arose
and
now
dormant
came
into
his
fortune
and
began
to
make
handsome
gifts
to
missionary
societies
and
to
his
own
meeting
in
the
town
if
i
do
not
mistake
he
gave
unsolicited
a
sum
to
our
building
fund
which
my
father
afterwards
returned
but
in
process
of
time
we
heard
that
the
son
had
come
back
from
the
antipodes
and
was
making
investigations
before
we
knew
where
we
were
the
news
burst
upon
us
like
a
that
dormant
had
been
arrested
on
a
criminal
charge
and
was
now
in
jail
at
exeter
sympathy
was
at
first
much
extended
amongst
us
to
the
prisoner
but
it
was
lessened
when
we
understood
that
the
old
gentleman
had
been
while
under
dormant
roof
and
had
given
the
fact
that
his
son
was
unbeliever
as
a
reason
for
disinheriting
him
all
doubt
was
set
aside
when
it
was
divulged
under
pressure
by
the
nurse
who
attended
on
the
old
gentleman
herself
one
of
the
that
dormant
had
traced
the
signature
to
the
will
by
drawing
the
fingers
of
the
testator
over
the
document
when
he
was
already
and
finally
comatose
my
father
setting
aside
by
a
strong
effort
of
will
the
repugnance
which
he
felt
visited
the
prisoner
in
gaol
before
this
final
evidence
had
been
extracted
when
he
returned
he
said
that
dormant
appeared
to
be
enjoying
a
perfect
confidence
of
heart
and
had
expressed
a
sense
of
his
joy
and
peace
in
the
lord
my
father
regretted
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
persuade
him
to
admit
any
error
even
of
judgement
but
the
attitude
in
the
dock
when
the
facts
were
proved
and
not
by
him
denied
was
still
more
extraordinary
he
could
be
induced
to
exhibit
no
species
of
remorse
and
to
the
obvious
anger
of
the
judge
himself
stated
that
he
had
only
done
his
duty
as
a
christian
in
preventing
this
wealth
from
coming
into
the
hands
of
an
ungodly
man
who
would
have
spent
it
in
the
service
of
the
flesh
and
of
the
devil
sternly
reprimanded
by
the
judge
he
made
the
final
statement
that
at
that
very
moment
he
was
conscious
of
his
lord
presence
in
the
dock
at
his
side
whispering
to
him
done
thou
good
and
faithful
servant
in
this
frame
of
conscience
and
with
a
glowing
countenance
he
was
hurried
away
to
penal
servitude
this
was
a
very
painful
incident
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
compromising
how
cruel
it
was
in
its
effect
upon
our
communion
what
occasion
it
gave
to
our
enemies
to
blaspheme
no
one
in
either
meeting
could
or
would
raise
a
voice
to
defend
dormant
we
had
to
bow
our
heads
when
we
met
our
enemies
in
the
gate
the
blow
fell
more
heavily
on
the
meeting
of
which
he
had
been
a
prominent
and
communicating
member
but
it
fell
on
us
too
and
my
father
felt
it
severely
for
many
years
he
would
never
mention
the
man
name
and
he
refused
all
discussion
of
the
incident
yet
i
was
never
sure
and
i
am
not
sure
now
that
the
wretched
being
was
a
hypocrite
there
are
as
many
vulgar
fanatics
as
there
are
distinguished
ones
and
i
am
not
convinced
that
dormant
coarse
and
narrow
as
he
was
may
not
have
sincerely
believed
that
it
was
better
for
the
money
to
be
used
in
religious
propaganda
than
in
the
pleasures
of
the
world
of
which
he
doubtless
formed
a
very
vague
idea
on
this
affair
i
meditated
much
and
it
awakened
in
my
mind
for
the
first
time
a
doubt
whether
our
exclusive
system
of
ethics
was
an
entirely
salutary
one
if
it
could
lead
the
conscience
of
a
believer
to
tolerate
such
acts
as
these
acts
which
my
father
himself
had
denounced
as
dishonourable
and
disgraceful
my
stepmother
brought
with
her
a
little
library
of
such
books
as
we
had
not
previously
seen
but
which
yet
were
known
to
all
the
world
except
us
prominent
among
these
was
a
set
of
the
poems
of
walter
scott
and
in
his
unwonted
geniality
and
provisional
spirit
of
compromise
my
father
must
do
no
less
than
read
these
works
aloud
to
my
stepmother
in
the
quiet
spring
evenings
this
was
a
sort
of
aftermath
of
courtship
a
tribute
of
song
to
his
bride
very
sentimental
and
pretty
she
would
sit
sedately
at
her
workbox
while
he
facing
her
poured
forth
the
verses
at
her
like
a
blackbird
i
was
not
considered
in
this
arrangement
which
was
wholly
matrimonial
but
i
was
present
and
the
exercise
made
more
impression
upon
me
than
it
did
upon
either
of
the
principal
agents
my
father
read
the
verse
admirably
with
a
full
some
people
but
not
i
might
say
with
a
too
full
perception
of
the
metre
as
well
as
of
the
rhythm
rolling
out
the
rhymes
and
glorying
in
the
proper
names
he
began
and
it
was
a
happy
choice
with
lady
of
the
lake
it
gave
me
singular
pleasure
to
hear
his
large
voice
do
justice
to
and
kenneth
and
wake
the
echoes
with
vich
alphine
dhu
ho
ieroe
i
almost
gasped
with
excitement
while
a
shudder
floated
down
my
backbone
when
we
came
to
a
sharp
and
shrieking
echo
gave
thy
goblin
cave
and
the
grey
pass
where
birches
wave
on
a
passage
which
seemed
to
me
to
achieve
the
ideal
of
sublime
romance
my
thoughts
were
occupied
all
day
long
with
the
adventures
of
fitzjames
and
the
denizens
of
ellen
isle
it
became
an
obsession
and
when
i
was
asked
whether
i
remembered
the
name
of
the
cottage
where
the
minister
of
the
bible
christians
lodged
i
answered
dreamily
seeing
me
so
much
fascinated
thrown
indeed
into
a
temporary
frenzy
by
the
epic
poetry
of
sir
walter
scott
my
stepmother
asked
my
father
whether
i
might
not
start
reading
the
waverley
novels
but
he
refused
to
permit
this
on
the
ground
that
those
tales
gave
false
and
disturbing
pictures
of
life
and
would
lead
away
my
attention
from
heavenly
things
i
do
not
fully
apprehend
what
distinction
he
drew
between
the
poems
which
he
permitted
and
the
novels
which
he
refused
but
i
suppose
he
regarded
a
work
in
verse
as
more
artificial
and
therefore
less
likely
to
make
a
realistic
impression
than
one
in
prose
there
is
something
quaint
in
the
conscientious
scruple
which
allows
lord
of
the
and
excludes
but
stranger
still
and
amounting
almost
to
a
whim
was
his
sudden
decision
that
although
i
might
not
touch
the
novels
of
scott
i
was
free
to
read
those
of
dickens
i
recollect
that
my
stepmother
showed
some
surprise
at
this
and
that
my
father
explained
to
her
that
dickens
the
passion
of
love
in
a
ridiculous
light
she
did
not
seem
to
follow
this
recommendation
which
indeed
tends
to
the
but
she
procured
for
me
a
copy
of
by
which
i
was
instantly
and
gloriously
enslaved
my
shouts
of
laughing
at
the
richer
passages
were
almost
scandalous
and
led
to
my
being
reproved
for
disturbing
my
father
while
engaged
in
an
upper
room
in
the
study
of
god
word
i
must
have
expended
months
on
the
perusal
of
for
i
used
to
rush
through
a
chapter
and
then
read
it
over
again
very
slowly
word
for
word
and
then
shut
my
eyes
to
realize
the
figures
and
the
action
i
suppose
no
child
will
ever
again
enjoy
that
rapture
of
unresisting
humorous
appreciation
of
i
felt
myself
to
be
in
the
company
of
a
gentleman
so
extremely
funny
that
i
began
to
laugh
before
he
began
to
speak
no
sooner
did
he
remark
sky
was
dark
and
gloomy
the
air
was
damp
and
raw
than
i
was
in
fits
of
hilarity
my
retirement
in
our
sequestered
corner
of
life
made
me
perhaps
even
in
this
matter
somewhat
and
possibly
i
was
the
latest
of
the
generation
who
accepted
pickwick
with
an
unquestioning
and
hysterical
abandonment
certainly
few
young
people
now
seem
sensitive
as
i
was
and
as
thousands
before
me
had
been
to
the
quality
of
his
fascination
it
was
curious
that
living
in
a
household
where
a
certain
delicate
art
of
painting
was
diligently
cultivated
i
had
yet
never
seen
a
real
picture
and
was
scarcely
familiar
with
the
design
of
one
in
engraving
my
stepmother
however
brought
a
flavour
of
the
fine
arts
with
her
a
kind
of
aesthetic
odour
like
that
of
lavender
clung
to
her
as
she
moved
she
had
known
authentic
artists
in
her
youth
she
had
watched
old
crome
painting
and
had
taken
a
course
of
from
no
less
a
person
than
cotman
she
painted
small
watercolour
landscapes
herself
with
a
delicate
economy
of
means
and
a
graceful
norwich
convention
her
were
filled
with
abbeys
gently
washed
in
in
sepia
by
which
the
elect
might
be
dimly
reminded
of
and
woodland
scenes
over
which
the
ghost
of
creswick
had
faintly
breathed
it
was
not
exciting
art
but
it
was
so
far
as
it
went
in
its
reserve
the
real
thing
our
our
tropic
birds
our
bits
of
spongy
rock
filled
and
sprayed
with
corallines
had
been
very
conscientious
and
skilful
but
essentially
so
far
as
art
was
concerned
the
wrong
thing
thus
i
began
to
acquire
without
understanding
the
value
of
it
some
conception
of
the
elegant
phases
of
early
english
watercolour
painting
and
there
was
one
singular
piece
of
a
marble
well
brimming
with
water
and
a
sky
over
it
and
poplars
shaped
like
wet
brooms
menacing
the
middle
distance
which
cotman
himself
had
painted
and
this
seemed
beautiful
and
curious
to
me
in
its
dim
flat
frame
when
it
was
hoisted
to
a
place
on
our
wall
but
still
i
had
never
seen
a
although
my
stepmother
used
to
talk
of
the
joys
of
the
royal
academy
and
it
was
therefore
with
a
considerable
sense
of
excitement
that
i
went
with
my
father
to
examine
holman
hunt
of
christ
in
the
temple
which
at
this
time
was
announced
to
be
on
public
show
at
our
neighbouring
town
we
paid
our
shillings
and
ascended
with
others
to
an
upper
room
bare
of
every
disturbing
object
in
which
a
strong
raked
the
large
and
uncompromising
picture
we
looked
at
it
for
some
time
in
silence
and
then
my
father
pointed
out
to
me
various
details
such
as
the
phylacteries
and
the
mitres
and
the
robes
which
distinguished
the
high
priest
some
of
the
other
visitors
as
i
recollect
expressed
astonishment
and
dislike
of
what
they
called
the
treatment
but
we
were
not
affected
by
that
indeed
if
anything
the
exact
minute
and
hard
execution
of
hunt
was
in
sympathy
with
the
methods
we
ourselves
were
in
the
habit
of
using
when
we
painted
butterflies
and
seaweeds
placing
perfectly
pure
pigments
side
by
side
without
any
nonsense
about
chiaroscuro
this
large
bright
comprehensive
picture
made
a
very
deep
impression
upon
me
not
exactly
as
a
work
of
art
but
as
a
brilliant
natural
specimen
i
was
pleased
to
have
seen
it
as
i
was
pleased
to
have
seen
the
comet
and
the
whale
which
was
brought
to
our
front
door
on
a
truck
it
was
a
prominent
addition
to
my
experience
the
slender
expansions
of
my
interest
which
were
now
budding
hither
and
thither
do
not
seem
to
have
alarmed
my
father
at
all
his
views
were
short
if
i
appeared
to
be
contented
and
obedient
if
i
responded
pleasantly
when
he
appealed
to
me
he
was
not
concerned
to
discover
the
source
of
my
cheerfulness
he
put
it
down
to
my
happy
sense
of
joy
in
christ
a
reflection
of
the
sunshine
of
grace
beaming
upon
me
through
no
intervening
clouds
of
sin
or
doubt
the
were
as
a
rule
very
easy
to
comprehend
their
emotions
lay
upon
the
surface
if
they
were
gay
it
was
because
they
had
no
burden
on
their
consciences
while
if
they
were
depressed
the
symptom
might
be
depended
upon
as
showing
that
their
consciences
were
troubling
them
and
if
they
were
indifferent
and
cold
it
was
certain
that
they
were
losing
their
faith
and
becoming
hostile
to
godliness
it
was
almost
a
mechanical
matter
with
these
simple
souls
but
although
i
was
so
much
younger
i
was
more
complex
and
more
crafty
than
the
peasant
my
father
not
a
very
subtle
psychologist
applied
to
me
the
same
formulas
which
served
him
well
at
the
chapel
but
in
my
case
the
results
were
less
uniformly
successful
the
excitement
of
and
the
enlargement
of
my
circle
of
interests
combined
to
make
sunday
by
contrast
a
very
tedious
occasion
the
absence
of
every
species
of
recreation
on
the
lord
day
grew
to
be
a
burden
which
might
scarcely
be
borne
i
have
said
that
my
freedom
during
the
week
had
now
become
considerable
if
i
was
at
home
punctually
at
meal
times
the
rest
of
my
leisure
was
not
challenged
but
this
liberty
which
in
the
summer
holidays
came
to
surpass
that
of
that
tipple
in
the
deep
was
put
into
more
and
more
painful
contrast
with
the
unbroken
servitude
of
sunday
my
father
objected
very
strongly
to
the
expression
as
it
is
commonly
used
by
presbyterians
and
others
he
said
quite
justly
that
it
was
an
inaccurate
modern
innovation
that
sabbath
was
saturday
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
not
the
first
a
jewish
festival
and
not
a
christian
commemoration
yet
his
exaggerated
view
with
regard
to
the
observance
of
the
first
day
namely
that
it
must
be
exclusively
occupied
with
public
and
private
exercises
of
divine
worship
was
based
much
more
upon
a
jewish
than
upon
a
christian
law
in
fact
i
do
not
remember
that
my
father
ever
produced
a
definite
argument
from
the
new
testament
in
support
of
his
excessive
passivity
on
the
day
he
followed
the
early
puritan
practice
except
that
he
did
not
extend
his
observance
as
i
believe
the
old
puritans
did
from
sunset
on
saturday
to
sunset
on
sunday
the
observance
of
the
lord
day
has
already
become
universally
so
lax
that
i
think
there
may
be
some
value
in
preserving
an
accurate
record
of
how
our
sundays
were
spent
five
and
forty
years
ago
we
came
down
to
breakfast
at
the
usual
time
my
father
prayed
briefly
before
we
began
the
meal
after
it
the
bell
was
rung
and
before
the
breakfast
was
cleared
away
we
had
a
lengthy
service
of
exposition
and
prayer
with
the
servants
if
the
weather
was
fine
we
then
walked
about
the
garden
doing
nothing
for
about
half
an
hour
we
then
sat
each
in
a
separate
room
with
our
bibles
open
and
some
commentary
on
the
text
beside
us
and
prepared
our
minds
for
the
morning
service
a
little
before
we
sallied
forth
carrying
our
bibles
and
books
and
went
through
the
of
two
hours
at
the
room
this
was
the
central
event
of
sunday
we
then
came
back
to
dinner
curiously
enough
to
a
hot
dinner
always
with
a
joint
vegetables
and
puddings
so
that
the
cook
at
least
must
have
been
busily
at
work
and
after
it
my
father
and
my
stepmother
took
a
nap
each
in
a
different
room
while
i
slipped
out
into
the
garden
for
a
little
while
but
never
venturing
farther
afield
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
my
stepmother
and
i
proceeded
up
the
village
to
sunday
school
where
i
was
early
promoted
to
the
tuition
of
a
few
very
little
boys
we
returned
in
time
for
tea
immediately
after
which
we
all
marched
forth
again
armed
as
in
the
morning
with
bibles
and
and
we
went
though
the
at
which
my
father
preached
the
hour
was
now
already
past
my
weekday
bedtime
but
we
had
another
service
to
attend
the
believers
prayer
meeting
which
commonly
occupied
forty
minutes
more
then
we
used
to
creep
home
i
often
so
tired
that
the
weariness
was
like
physical
pain
and
i
was
permitted
without
further
to
slip
upstairs
to
bed
what
made
these
sundays
the
observance
of
which
was
absolutely
uniform
so
peculiarly
trying
was
that
i
was
not
permitted
the
indulgence
of
any
secular
respite
i
might
not
open
a
scientific
book
nor
make
a
drawing
nor
examine
a
specimen
i
was
not
allowed
to
go
into
the
road
except
to
proceed
with
my
parents
to
the
room
nor
to
discuss
worldly
subjects
at
meals
nor
to
enter
the
little
chamber
where
i
kept
my
treasures
i
was
hotly
and
tightly
dressed
in
black
all
day
long
as
though
ready
at
any
moment
to
attend
a
funeral
with
decorum
sometimes
towards
evening
i
used
to
feel
the
monotony
and
weariness
of
my
position
to
be
almost
unendurable
but
at
this
time
i
was
meek
and
i
bowed
to
what
i
supposed
to
be
the
order
of
the
universe
chapter
xi
as
my
mental
horizon
widened
my
father
followed
the
direction
of
my
spiritual
eyes
with
some
bewilderment
and
knew
not
at
what
i
gazed
nor
could
i
have
put
into
words
nor
can
i
even
now
define
the
visions
which
held
my
vague
and
timid
attention
as
a
child
develops
those
who
regard
it
with
tenderness
or
impatience
are
seldom
even
approximately
correct
in
their
analysis
of
its
intellectual
movements
largely
because
if
there
is
anything
to
record
it
defies
adult
definition
one
curious
freak
of
mentality
i
must
now
mention
because
it
took
a
considerable
part
in
the
enfranchisement
of
my
mind
or
rather
in
the
formation
of
my
thinking
habits
but
neither
my
father
nor
my
stepmother
knew
what
to
make
of
it
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
hardly
know
what
to
make
of
it
myself
among
the
books
which
my
new
mother
had
brought
with
her
were
certain
editions
of
the
poets
an
odd
assortment
campbell
was
there
and
burns
and
keats
and
the
of
byron
each
of
these
might
have
been
expected
to
appeal
to
me
but
my
emotion
was
too
young
and
i
did
not
listen
to
them
yet
their
imperative
voices
called
me
later
by
the
side
of
these
romantic
classics
stood
a
small
thick
volume
bound
in
black
morocco
and
comprising
four
reprinted
works
of
the
eighteenth
century
gloomy
funereal
poems
of
an
order
as
wholly
out
of
date
as
are
the
crossbones
and
ruffled
cherubim
on
the
gravestones
in
a
country
churchyard
the
four
and
in
this
order
as
i
never
shall
forget
were
last
day
of
dr
young
blair
by
bishop
beilby
porteus
and
deity
of
samuel
boyse
these
lugubrious
effusions
all
in
blank
verse
or
in
the
heroic
couplet
represented
in
its
most
redundant
form
the
artistic
theology
of
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
they
were
steeped
in
such
vengeful
and
hortatory
sentiments
as
passed
for
elegant
piety
in
the
reign
of
george
ii
how
i
came
to
open
this
solemn
volume
is
explained
by
the
oppressive
exclusiveness
of
our
sundays
on
the
afternoon
of
the
lord
day
as
i
have
already
explained
i
might
neither
walk
nor
talk
nor
explore
our
scientific
library
nor
indulge
in
furious
feats
of
painting
the
theology
which
alone
was
open
to
me
produced
at
length
and
particularly
on
hot
afternoons
a
faint
physical
nausea
a
kind
of
secret
headache
but
hitting
one
day
upon
the
doleful
book
of
verses
and
observing
its
religious
character
i
asked
i
read
that
and
after
a
brief
astonished
glance
at
the
contents
received
certainly
if
you
can
the
lawn
sloped
directly
from
a
verandah
at
our
window
and
it
contained
two
immense
elm
trees
which
had
originally
formed
part
of
the
hedge
of
a
meadow
in
our
trim
and
polished
garden
they
then
remained
they
were
soon
afterwards
cut
down
rude
and
obtuse
with
something
primeval
about
them
something
autochthonous
they
were
like
two
peasant
ancestors
surviving
in
a
family
that
had
advanced
to
gentility
they
rose
each
out
of
a
steep
turfed
hillock
and
the
root
of
one
of
them
was
long
my
favourite
summer
for
i
could
lie
stretched
on
the
lawn
with
my
head
and
shoulders
supported
by
the
hillock
and
the
book
in
a
fissure
of
the
rough
turf
thither
then
i
escaped
with
my
graveyard
poets
and
who
shall
explain
the
rapture
with
which
i
followed
their
austere
morality
whether
i
really
read
consecutively
in
my
volume
i
can
no
longer
be
sure
but
it
became
a
companion
whose
society
i
valued
and
at
worst
it
was
a
thousand
times
more
congenial
to
me
than
jukes
the
pentateuch
or
than
a
perfectly
excruciating
work
ambiguously
styled
javelin
of
phineas
which
lay
smouldering
in
a
dull
red
cover
on
the
table
i
dipped
my
bucket
here
and
there
into
my
poets
and
i
brought
up
strange
things
i
brought
up
out
of
the
depths
of
last
the
following
ejaculation
of
a
soul
roused
by
the
trump
of
resurrection
father
of
mercies
why
from
silent
earth
didst
thou
awake
and
curse
me
into
birth
tear
me
from
quiet
ravish
me
from
night
and
make
a
thankless
present
of
thy
light
push
into
being
a
reverse
of
thee
and
animate
a
clod
with
misery
i
read
these
lines
with
a
shiver
of
excitement
and
in
a
sense
i
suppose
little
intended
by
the
sanctimonious
rector
of
welwyn
i
also
read
in
the
same
piece
the
surprising
description
of
how
now
charnels
rattle
scattered
limbs
and
all
the
various
bones
obsequious
to
the
call
advance
the
neck
perhaps
to
meet
the
distant
head
the
distant
legs
the
feet
but
rejected
it
as
not
wholly
supported
by
the
testimony
of
scripture
i
think
that
the
rhetoric
and
vigorous
advance
of
young
verse
were
pleasant
to
me
beilby
porteus
i
discarded
from
the
first
as
impenetrable
in
deity
i
knew
nothing
then
of
the
life
of
its
extravagant
and
preposterous
author
i
took
a
kind
of
persistent
penitential
pleasure
but
it
was
blair
that
really
delighted
me
and
i
frightened
myself
with
its
melodious
doleful
images
in
earnest
about
this
time
there
was
a
great
flow
of
hospitality
in
the
village
and
my
friends
and
their
friends
used
to
be
asked
out
by
respective
parents
and
by
more
than
one
amiable
spinster
to
faint
little
entertainments
where
those
sang
who
were
ambitious
to
sing
and
where
all
played
post
and
forfeits
after
a
rich
tea
my
father
was
constantly
exercised
in
mind
as
to
whether
i
should
or
should
not
accept
these
glittering
invitations
there
hovered
before
him
a
painful
sense
of
danger
in
resigning
the
soul
to
pleasures
which
savoured
of
world
these
though
apparently
innocent
in
themselves
might
give
an
appetite
for
yet
more
subversive
dissipations
i
remember
on
one
occasion
when
the
browns
a
family
of
baptists
who
kept
a
large
haberdashery
shop
in
the
neighbouring
town
asked
for
the
pleasure
of
my
company
tea
and
games
and
carried
complacency
so
far
as
to
offer
to
send
that
local
vehicle
midge
to
fetch
me
and
bring
me
back
my
father
conscience
was
so
painfully
perplexed
that
he
desired
me
to
come
up
with
him
to
the
of
the
departed
marks
that
we
might
the
matter
before
the
lord
we
did
so
kneeling
side
by
side
with
our
backs
to
the
window
and
our
foreheads
pressed
upon
the
horsehair
cover
of
the
small
sofa
my
father
prayed
aloud
with
great
fervour
that
it
might
be
revealed
to
me
by
the
voice
of
god
whether
it
was
or
was
not
the
lord
will
that
i
should
attend
the
browns
party
my
father
attitude
seemed
to
me
to
be
hardly
fair
since
he
did
not
scruple
to
remind
the
deity
of
various
objections
to
a
life
of
pleasure
and
of
the
snakes
that
lie
hidden
in
the
grass
of
evening
parties
it
would
have
been
more
scrupulous
i
thought
to
give
no
sort
of
hint
of
the
kind
of
answer
he
desired
and
expected
it
will
be
justly
said
that
my
life
was
made
up
of
very
trifling
things
since
i
have
to
confess
that
this
incident
of
the
invitation
was
one
of
its
landmarks
as
i
knelt
feeling
very
small
by
the
immense
bulk
of
my
father
there
gushed
though
my
veins
like
a
wine
the
determination
to
rebel
never
before
in
all
these
years
of
my
vocation
had
i
felt
my
resistance
take
precisely
this
definite
form
we
rose
presently
from
the
sofa
my
forehead
and
the
backs
of
my
hands
still
chafed
by
the
texture
of
the
horsehair
and
we
faced
one
another
in
the
dreary
light
my
father
perfectly
confident
in
the
success
of
what
had
really
been
a
sort
of
incantation
asked
me
in
a
loud
wheedling
voice
and
what
is
the
answer
which
our
lord
vouchsafes
i
said
nothing
and
so
my
father
more
sharply
continued
have
asked
him
to
direct
you
to
a
true
knowledge
of
his
will
we
have
desired
him
to
let
you
know
whether
it
is
or
is
not
in
accordance
with
his
wishes
that
you
should
accept
this
invitation
from
the
browns
he
positively
beamed
down
at
me
he
had
no
doubt
of
the
reply
he
was
already
i
believe
planning
some
little
treat
to
make
up
to
me
for
the
material
deprivation
but
my
answer
came
in
the
accents
of
despair
lord
says
i
may
go
to
the
browns
my
father
gazed
at
me
in
speechless
horror
he
was
caught
in
his
own
trap
and
though
he
was
certain
that
the
lord
had
said
nothing
of
the
kind
there
was
no
road
open
for
him
but
just
sheer
retreat
yet
surely
it
was
an
error
in
tactics
to
slam
the
door
it
was
at
this
party
at
the
browns
to
which
i
duly
went
although
in
sore
disgrace
that
my
charnel
poets
played
me
a
mean
trick
it
was
proposed
that
young
friends
should
give
their
elders
the
treat
of
repeating
any
pretty
pieces
that
they
knew
by
heart
accordingly
a
little
girl
recited
and
another
little
girl
are
seven
and
various
children
were
induced
to
repeat
hymns
rather
long
as
calverley
says
but
all
very
mild
and
innocuously
evangelical
i
was
then
asked
by
brown
maiden
sister
a
gushing
lady
in
corkscrew
curls
who
led
the
revels
whether
i
also
would
not
indulge
them
repeating
some
sweet
stanzas
no
one
more
ready
than
i
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
stood
forth
and
in
a
loud
voice
i
began
one
of
my
favourite
passages
from
blair
if
death
were
nothing
and
nought
after
death
if
when
men
died
at
once
they
ceased
to
be
returning
to
the
barren
womb
of
nothing
whence
first
they
sprung
then
might
the
debauchee
you
dear
that
will
do
nicely
interrupted
the
lady
with
the
curls
that
only
the
beginning
of
it
i
cried
dear
but
that
will
quite
do
we
wo
ask
you
to
repeat
any
more
of
it
and
i
withdrew
to
the
borders
of
the
company
in
bewilderment
nor
did
the
browns
or
their
visitors
ever
learn
what
it
was
the
debauchee
might
have
said
or
done
in
more
favourable
circumstances
the
growing
eagerness
which
i
displayed
for
the
society
of
selected
schoolfellows
and
for
such
gentle
dissipations
as
were
within
my
reach
exercised
my
father
greatly
his
fancy
rushed
forward
with
the
pace
of
a
and
saw
me
the
life
and
soul
of
a
gambling
club
or
flaunting
it
at
the
mabille
he
had
no
confidence
in
the
action
of
moderating
powers
and
he
was
fond
of
repeating
that
the
downward
path
is
easy
if
one
fretted
to
be
bathing
with
one
companions
on
the
shingle
and
preferred
this
exercise
to
the
study
of
god
word
it
was
a
symbol
of
a
terrible
decline
the
angle
of
which
would
grow
steeper
and
steeper
until
one
plunged
into
perdition
he
was
himself
timid
and
reclusive
and
he
shrank
from
all
avoidable
companionship
with
others
except
on
the
footing
of
a
master
and
teacher
my
stepmother
and
i
who
neither
taught
nor
ruled
yearned
for
a
looser
chain
and
lighter
relationships
with
regard
to
myself
my
father
about
this
time
hit
on
a
plan
from
which
he
hoped
much
but
from
which
little
resulted
he
looked
to
george
to
supply
what
my
temperament
seemed
to
require
of
congenial
juvenile
companionship
if
i
have
not
mentioned
until
now
it
is
not
that
he
was
a
new
acquaintance
when
we
first
came
down
into
the
country
our
sympathy
had
been
called
forth
by
an
accident
to
a
little
boy
who
was
knocked
over
by
a
horse
and
whose
thigh
was
broken
somebody
i
suppose
mary
grace
since
my
father
could
rarely
bring
himself
to
pay
these
public
visits
went
to
see
the
child
in
the
infirmary
and
accidentally
discovered
that
he
was
exactly
the
same
age
that
i
was
this
and
the
fact
that
he
was
a
meditative
and
sober
little
boy
attracted
us
all
still
further
to
george
who
became
converted
under
one
of
my
father
sermons
he
attended
my
public
baptism
and
was
so
much
moved
by
this
ceremony
that
he
passionately
desired
to
be
baptized
also
and
was
in
fact
so
immersed
a
few
months
later
slightly
to
my
chagrin
since
i
thereupon
ceased
to
be
the
only
infant
prodigy
in
communion
when
we
were
both
in
our
thirteenth
year
george
became
an
outdoor
servant
to
us
and
did
odd
jobs
under
the
gardener
my
father
finding
him
as
he
said
obedient
and
engaging
petted
george
a
good
deal
and
taught
him
a
little
botany
he
called
george
by
a
curious
contortion
of
thought
my
and
anticipated
for
him
i
think
a
career
like
mine
in
the
ministry
our
garden
suffered
from
an
incursion
of
slugs
which
laid
the
verbenas
in
the
dust
and
shore
off
the
carnations
as
if
with
pairs
of
scissors
to
cope
with
this
plague
we
invested
in
a
drake
and
a
duck
who
were
christened
philemon
and
baucis
every
night
large
containing
the
lees
of
beer
were
spread
about
the
as
traps
and
at
dawn
these
had
become
green
parlours
crammed
with
intoxicated
slugs
one
of
george
earliest
morning
duties
was
to
free
philemon
and
baucis
from
their
coop
and
armed
with
a
small
wand
to
guide
their
footsteps
to
the
feast
in
one
after
another
my
father
used
to
watch
this
performance
from
an
upper
window
and
in
moments
of
high
facetiousness
he
was
wont
to
parody
the
poet
gray
how
jocund
doth
george
drive
his
team
afield
this
is
all
or
almost
all
that
i
remember
about
occupations
but
he
was
singularly
blameless
my
father
plan
now
was
that
i
should
form
a
close
intimacy
with
george
as
a
boy
of
my
own
age
of
my
own
faith
of
my
own
future
my
stepmother
still
in
bondage
to
the
social
conventions
was
passionately
troubled
at
this
and
urged
the
barrier
of
my
father
replied
that
such
an
intimacy
would
keep
me
and
that
from
so
good
a
boy
as
george
i
could
learn
nothing
undesirable
will
encourage
him
not
to
wipe
his
boots
when
he
comes
into
the
house
said
my
stepmother
and
my
father
sighed
to
think
how
narrow
is
the
horizon
of
woman
view
of
heavenly
things
in
this
caprice
if
i
may
call
it
so
i
think
that
my
father
had
before
him
the
fine
republican
example
of
and
merton
some
parts
of
which
book
he
admired
extremely
accordingly
george
and
i
were
sent
out
to
take
walks
together
and
as
we
started
my
father
with
an
air
of
great
benevolence
would
suggest
some
passage
of
scripture
or
aspect
of
god
bountiful
scheme
in
creation
on
which
you
may
profitably
meditate
together
george
and
i
never
pursued
the
discussion
of
the
text
with
which
my
father
started
us
for
more
than
a
minute
or
two
then
we
fell
into
silence
or
investigated
current
scenes
and
rustic
topics
as
is
natural
among
the
children
of
the
poor
george
was
precocious
where
i
was
infantile
and
undeveloped
where
i
was
elaborate
our
minds
could
hardly
find
a
point
at
which
to
touch
he
gave
me
however
under
interesting
hints
about
rural
matters
and
i
liked
him
although
i
felt
his
company
to
be
insipid
sometimes
he
carried
my
books
by
my
side
to
the
larger
and
more
distant
school
which
i
now
attended
but
i
was
always
in
a
fever
of
dread
lest
my
schoolfellows
should
see
him
and
should
accuse
me
of
having
to
be
to
school
to
explain
to
them
that
the
companionship
of
this
wholesome
and
rather
blunt
young
peasant
was
part
of
my
spiritual
discipline
would
have
been
all
beyond
my
powers
it
was
soon
after
this
that
my
stepmother
made
her
one
vain
effort
to
break
though
the
stillness
of
our
lives
my
energy
seemed
to
decline
to
become
more
fitful
to
take
unseasonable
directions
my
mother
instinctively
felt
that
his
peculiarities
were
growing
upon
him
he
would
scarcely
stir
from
his
microscope
except
to
go
to
the
chapel
and
he
was
visible
to
fewer
and
fewer
visitors
she
had
taken
a
pleasure
in
his
literary
eminence
and
she
was
aware
that
this
too
would
slip
from
him
that
so
persistently
kept
out
of
sight
he
must
soon
be
out
of
mind
i
know
not
how
she
gathered
courage
for
her
tremendous
effort
but
she
took
me
i
recollect
into
her
counsels
we
were
to
unite
to
oblige
my
father
to
start
to
his
feet
and
face
the
world
alas
we
might
as
well
have
attempted
to
rouse
the
summit
of
yes
tor
into
volcanic
action
to
my
arguments
my
father
with
that
baffling
smile
of
his
replied
esteem
the
reproach
of
christ
greater
riches
than
the
treasures
of
egypt
and
that
this
answer
was
indirect
made
it
none
the
less
conclusive
my
mother
wished
him
to
give
lectures
to
go
to
london
to
read
papers
before
the
royal
society
to
enter
into
controversy
with
foreign
savants
to
conduct
classes
of
outdoor
zoology
at
fashionable
i
held
my
breath
with
admiration
as
she
poured
forth
her
scheme
so
daring
so
brilliant
so
sure
to
cover
our
great
man
with
glory
he
listened
to
her
with
an
ambiguous
smile
and
shook
his
head
at
us
and
resumed
the
reading
of
his
bible
at
the
date
of
which
i
write
these
pages
the
arts
of
illustration
are
so
universally
diffused
that
it
is
difficult
to
realize
the
darkness
in
which
a
remote
english
village
was
plunged
half
a
century
ago
no
opportunity
was
offered
to
us
dwellers
in
remote
places
of
realizing
the
outward
appearances
of
unfamiliar
persons
scenes
or
things
although
ours
was
perhaps
the
most
cultivated
household
in
the
parish
i
had
never
seen
so
much
as
a
representation
of
a
work
of
sculpture
until
i
was
thirteen
my
mother
then
received
from
her
earlier
home
certain
volumes
among
which
was
a
gaudy
of
some
kind
containing
a
few
steel
engravings
of
statues
these
attracted
me
violently
and
here
for
the
first
time
i
gazed
on
apollo
with
his
proud
gesture
venus
in
her
undulations
the
kirtled
shape
of
diana
and
jupiter
voluminously
bearded
very
little
information
and
that
tome
not
intelligible
was
given
in
the
text
but
these
were
said
to
be
figures
of
the
old
greek
gods
i
asked
my
father
to
tell
me
about
these
greek
gods
his
answer
was
direct
and
disconcerting
he
said
how
i
recollect
the
place
and
time
early
in
the
morning
as
i
stood
beside
the
window
in
our
garish
he
said
that
the
gods
of
the
greeks
were
the
shadows
cast
by
the
vices
of
the
heathen
and
reflected
their
infamous
lives
was
for
such
things
as
these
that
god
poured
down
brimstone
and
fire
on
the
cities
of
the
plain
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legends
of
these
gods
or
rather
devils
that
it
is
not
better
for
a
christian
not
to
know
his
face
blazed
white
with
puritan
fury
as
he
said
this
i
see
him
now
in
my
mind
eye
in
his
violent
emotion
you
might
have
thought
that
he
had
himself
escaped
with
horror
from
some
hellenic
hippodrome
my
father
prestige
was
by
this
time
considerably
lessened
in
my
mind
and
though
i
loved
and
admired
him
i
had
now
long
ceased
to
hold
him
infallible
i
did
not
accept
his
condemnation
of
the
greeks
although
i
bowed
to
it
in
private
i
returned
to
examine
my
steel
engravings
of
the
statues
and
i
reflected
that
they
were
too
beautiful
to
be
so
wicked
as
my
father
thought
they
were
the
dangerous
and
pagan
notion
that
beauty
palliates
evil
budded
in
my
mind
without
any
external
suggestion
and
by
this
reflection
alone
i
was
still
further
sundered
from
the
faith
in
which
i
had
been
trained
i
gathered
very
diligently
all
i
could
pick
up
about
the
greek
gods
and
their
statues
it
was
not
much
it
was
indeed
ludicrously
little
and
false
but
it
was
a
germ
and
at
this
aesthetic
juncture
i
was
drawn
into
what
was
really
rather
an
extraordinary
circle
of
incidents
among
the
in
our
village
there
lived
a
shoemaker
and
his
wife
who
had
one
daughter
susan
flood
she
was
a
flighty
excited
young
creature
and
lately
during
the
passage
of
some
itinerary
revivalists
she
had
been
in
the
noisiest
way
with
sobs
gasps
and
gurglings
when
this
crisis
passed
she
came
with
her
parents
to
our
meetings
and
was
received
quietly
enough
to
the
breaking
of
bread
but
about
the
time
i
speak
of
susan
flood
went
up
to
london
to
pay
a
visit
to
an
unconverted
uncle
and
aunt
it
was
first
whispered
amongst
us
and
then
openly
stated
that
these
relatives
had
taken
her
to
the
crystal
palace
where
in
passing
through
the
sculpture
gallery
sense
of
decency
had
been
so
grievously
affronted
that
she
had
smashed
the
naked
figures
with
the
handle
of
her
parasol
before
her
horrified
companions
could
stop
her
she
had
in
fact
run
amok
among
the
statuary
and
had
to
the
intense
chagrin
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
very
worthy
persons
been
arrested
and
brought
before
a
magistrate
who
dismissed
her
with
a
warning
to
her
relations
that
she
had
better
be
sent
home
to
devonshire
and
after
susan
flood
return
to
us
however
was
a
triumph
she
had
no
sense
of
having
acted
injudiciously
or
unbecomingly
she
was
ready
to
recount
to
every
one
in
vague
and
veiled
language
how
she
had
been
able
to
testify
for
the
lord
the
very
temple
of
belial
for
so
she
poetically
described
the
crystal
palace
she
was
of
course
in
a
state
of
unbridled
hysteria
but
such
physical
explanations
were
not
encouraged
amongst
us
and
the
case
of
susan
flood
awakened
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
there
was
held
a
meeting
of
the
elders
in
our
to
discuss
it
and
i
contrived
to
be
present
though
out
of
observation
my
father
while
he
recognized
the
purity
of
susan
flood
zeal
questioned
its
wisdom
he
noted
that
the
statuary
was
not
her
property
but
that
of
the
crystal
palace
of
the
other
communicants
none
i
think
had
the
very
slightest
notion
what
the
objects
were
that
susan
had
smashed
or
tried
to
smash
and
frankly
maintained
that
they
thought
her
conduct
magnificent
as
for
me
i
had
gathered
by
persistent
inquiry
enough
information
to
know
that
what
her
sacrilegious
parasol
had
attacked
were
bodies
of
my
mysterious
friends
the
greek
gods
and
if
all
the
rest
of
the
village
applauded
iconoclastic
susan
i
at
least
would
be
ardent
on
the
other
side
but
i
was
conscious
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
world
to
whom
i
could
go
for
sympathy
if
i
had
ever
read
i
should
have
murmured
apollo
pan
and
love
and
even
olympian
jove
grew
weak
when
killing
susan
glared
on
them
on
the
day
in
question
i
was
unable
to
endure
the
meeting
to
its
close
but
clutching
my
volume
of
the
funereal
poets
i
made
a
dash
for
the
garden
in
the
midst
of
a
mass
of
laurels
a
clearing
had
been
hollowed
out
where
ferns
were
grown
and
a
was
placed
there
was
no
regular
path
to
this
asylum
one
dived
under
the
boughs
of
the
laurel
and
came
up
again
in
absolute
seclusion
into
this
haunt
i
now
fled
to
meditate
about
the
savage
godliness
of
that
vandal
susan
flood
so
extremely
ignorant
was
i
that
i
supposed
her
to
have
destroyed
the
originals
of
the
statues
marble
and
unique
i
knew
nothing
about
plaster
casts
and
i
thought
the
damage
it
is
possible
that
there
had
really
been
no
damage
whatever
was
of
an
irreparable
character
i
sank
into
the
seat
with
the
great
wall
of
laurels
whispering
around
me
and
i
burst
into
tears
there
was
something
surely
quaint
and
pathetic
in
the
figure
of
a
little
plymouth
brother
sitting
in
that
advanced
year
of
grace
weeping
bitterly
for
indignities
done
to
hermes
and
to
aphrodite
then
i
opened
my
book
for
consolation
and
i
read
a
great
block
of
pompous
verse
out
of
deity
in
the
midst
of
which
exercise
yielding
to
the
softness
of
the
hot
and
aromatic
air
i
fell
fast
asleep
among
those
who
applauded
the
zeal
of
susan
flood
parasol
the
pagets
were
prominent
these
were
a
retired
baptist
minister
and
his
wife
from
exmouth
who
had
lately
settled
amongst
us
and
joined
in
the
breaking
of
bread
paget
was
a
fat
old
man
whose
round
pale
face
was
and
who
carried
a
full
crop
of
loose
white
hair
above
it
his
large
lips
were
always
moving
whether
he
spoke
or
not
he
resembled
as
i
now
perceive
the
portraits
of
coleridge
in
age
but
with
all
the
intellect
left
out
of
them
he
lived
in
a
sort
of
trance
of
solemn
religious
despondency
he
had
thrown
up
his
cure
of
souls
because
he
became
convinced
that
he
had
committed
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
his
wife
was
younger
than
he
very
small
very
tight
very
active
with
black
eyes
like
at
the
base
of
an
extremely
high
and
narrow
forehead
bordered
with
glossy
ringlets
he
was
very
cross
to
her
and
it
was
murmured
that
paget
had
often
had
to
pass
through
the
waters
of
affliction
they
were
very
poor
but
rigidly
genteel
and
she
was
careful
so
far
as
she
could
to
conceal
from
the
world
the
caprices
of
her
poor
lunatic
husband
in
our
circle
it
was
never
for
a
moment
admitted
that
paget
was
a
lunatic
it
was
said
that
he
had
gravely
sinned
and
was
under
the
lord
displeasure
prayers
were
abundantly
offered
up
that
he
might
be
led
back
into
the
pathway
of
light
and
that
the
smiling
face
might
be
drawn
forth
for
him
from
behind
the
frowning
providence
when
the
man
had
an
epileptic
seizure
in
the
high
street
he
was
not
taken
to
a
hospital
but
we
repeated
to
one
another
with
shaken
heads
that
satan
that
crooked
serpent
had
been
unloosed
for
a
season
paget
was
fond
of
talking
in
private
and
in
public
of
his
dreadful
spiritual
condition
and
he
would
drop
his
voice
while
he
spoke
of
having
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
with
a
sort
of
shuddering
exultation
such
as
people
sometimes
feel
in
the
possession
of
a
very
unusual
disease
it
might
be
thought
that
the
position
held
in
any
community
by
persons
so
afflicted
and
eccentric
as
the
pagets
would
be
very
precarious
but
it
was
not
so
with
us
on
the
contrary
they
took
a
prominent
place
at
once
paget
in
spite
of
his
spiritual
bankruptcy
was
only
too
anxious
to
help
my
father
in
his
ministrations
and
used
to
beg
to
be
allowed
to
pray
and
exhort
in
the
latter
case
he
took
the
tone
of
a
wounded
veteran
who
though
fallen
on
the
bloody
field
himself
could
still
encourage
younger
warriors
to
march
forward
to
victory
everybody
longed
to
know
what
the
exact
nature
had
been
of
that
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
which
had
deprived
paget
of
every
glimmer
of
hope
for
time
or
for
eternity
it
was
whispered
that
even
my
father
himself
was
not
precisely
acquainted
with
the
character
of
it
this
mysterious
disability
clothed
paget
for
us
with
a
kind
of
romance
we
watched
him
as
the
women
watched
dante
in
verona
whispering
behold
him
how
hell
reek
has
crisped
his
hair
and
singed
his
cheek
his
person
lacked
it
is
true
something
of
the
dignity
of
dante
for
it
was
his
caprice
to
walk
up
and
down
the
high
street
at
noonday
with
one
of
those
cascades
of
coloured
paper
which
were
known
as
for
your
fireplace
slung
over
the
back
and
another
over
the
front
of
his
body
these
he
manufactured
for
sale
and
he
adopted
the
quaint
practice
of
wearing
the
exuberant
objects
as
a
means
for
their
advertisement
paget
had
been
accustomed
to
rule
in
the
little
ministry
from
which
paget
celebrated
sin
had
banished
them
and
she
was
inclined
to
clutch
at
the
sceptre
now
she
was
the
only
person
i
ever
met
with
who
was
not
afraid
of
the
displeasure
of
my
father
she
would
fix
her
eyes
on
his
and
say
with
a
kind
of
gimlet
firmness
hardly
think
that
is
the
true
interpretation
brother
or
let
us
turn
to
colossians
and
see
what
the
holy
ghost
says
there
upon
this
matter
she
fascinated
my
father
who
was
not
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
interruption
and
as
she
was
not
to
be
softened
by
any
flattery
such
as
indeed
sister
is
your
acquaintance
with
the
means
of
grace
she
became
almost
a
terror
to
him
she
abused
her
powers
by
taking
great
liberties
which
culminated
in
her
drawing
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
my
poor
stepmother
displayed
overweening
love
of
dress
the
accusation
was
perfectly
false
my
stepmother
was
if
rather
richly
always
plainly
dressed
in
the
sober
quaker
mode
almost
her
only
ornament
was
a
large
carnelian
brooch
set
in
flowered
flat
gold
to
this
the
envenomed
paget
drew
my
father
attention
as
to
lead
the
little
ones
of
the
flock
into
temptation
my
poor
father
felt
it
his
duty
thus
directly
admonished
to
speak
to
my
mother
you
not
think
my
love
that
you
should
as
one
who
sets
an
example
to
others
discard
the
wearing
of
that
gaudy
brooch
must
fasten
one
collar
with
something
i
suppose
but
how
does
sister
paget
fasten
her
collar
paget
replied
my
mother
stung
at
last
into
rejoinder
her
collar
with
a
pin
and
that
is
a
thing
which
i
would
rather
die
than
do
nor
did
i
escape
the
attentions
of
this
zealous
reformer
paget
was
good
enough
to
take
a
great
interest
in
me
and
she
was
not
satisfied
with
the
way
in
which
i
was
being
brought
up
her
presence
seemed
to
pervade
the
village
and
i
could
neither
come
in
nor
go
out
without
seeing
her
hard
bonnet
and
her
lips
she
would
hasten
to
report
to
my
father
that
she
saw
me
laughing
and
talking
a
lot
of
unconverted
boys
these
being
the
companions
with
whom
i
had
full
permission
to
bathe
and
boat
she
urged
my
father
to
complete
my
holy
vocation
by
some
definite
step
by
which
he
would
dedicate
me
completely
to
the
lord
service
further
schooling
she
thought
needless
and
merely
likely
to
foster
intellectual
pride
paget
she
remarked
had
troubled
very
little
in
his
youth
about
worldly
knowledge
and
yet
how
blessed
he
had
been
in
the
conversion
of
souls
until
he
had
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
holy
ghost
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
she
wanted
my
father
to
do
with
me
perhaps
she
did
not
know
herself
she
was
meddlesome
ignorant
and
fanatical
and
she
liked
to
fancy
that
she
was
exercising
influence
but
the
wonderful
the
inexplicable
thing
is
that
my
father
who
with
all
his
limitations
was
so
distinguished
and
should
listen
to
her
for
a
moment
and
still
more
wonderful
is
it
that
he
really
allowed
her
grim
vixen
that
she
was
to
disturb
his
plans
and
retard
his
purposes
i
think
the
explanation
lay
in
the
perfectly
logical
position
she
took
up
my
father
found
himself
brought
face
to
face
at
last
not
with
a
disciple
but
with
a
trained
expert
in
his
own
peculiar
scheme
of
religion
at
every
point
she
was
armed
with
arguments
the
source
of
which
he
knew
and
the
validity
of
which
he
recognized
he
trembled
before
paget
as
a
man
in
a
dream
may
tremble
before
a
parody
of
his
own
central
self
and
he
could
not
blame
her
without
laying
himself
open
somewhere
to
censure
but
my
stepmother
instincts
were
more
primitive
and
her
actions
less
than
my
father
she
disliked
paget
as
much
as
one
earnest
believer
can
bring
herself
to
dislike
a
sister
in
the
lord
my
stepmother
had
quietly
devoted
herself
to
what
she
thought
the
best
way
of
bringing
me
up
and
she
did
not
propose
now
to
be
thwarted
by
the
wife
of
a
lunatic
baptist
at
this
time
i
was
a
mixture
of
childishness
and
priggishness
of
curious
knowledge
and
dense
ignorance
certain
portions
of
my
intellect
were
growing
with
unwholesome
activity
while
others
were
stunted
or
had
never
stirred
at
all
i
was
like
a
plant
on
which
a
pot
has
been
placed
with
the
effect
that
the
centre
is
crushed
and
arrested
while
shoots
are
straggling
up
to
the
light
on
all
sides
my
father
himself
was
aware
of
this
and
in
a
spasmodic
way
he
wished
to
regulate
my
thoughts
but
all
he
did
was
to
try
to
straighten
the
shoots
without
removing
the
pot
which
kept
them
resolutely
down
it
was
my
stepmother
who
decided
that
i
was
now
old
enough
to
go
to
and
my
father
having
discovered
that
an
elderly
couple
of
plymouth
brethren
kept
an
for
young
gentlemen
in
a
neighbouring
seaport
town
in
the
prospectus
of
which
the
knowledge
and
love
of
the
lord
were
mentioned
as
occupying
the
attention
of
the
head
master
and
his
assistants
far
more
closely
than
any
mere
considerations
of
worldly
tuition
was
persuaded
to
entrust
me
to
its
care
he
stipulated
however
that
i
should
always
come
home
from
saturday
night
to
monday
morning
not
as
he
said
that
i
might
receive
any
carnal
indulgence
but
that
there
might
be
no
cessation
of
my
communion
as
a
believer
with
the
saints
in
our
village
on
sundays
to
this
school
therefore
i
presently
departed
gawky
and
homesick
and
the
rift
between
my
soul
and
that
of
my
father
widened
a
little
more
chapter
xii
little
boys
from
quiet
pious
households
commonly
found
in
those
days
a
chasm
yawning
at
the
feet
of
their
inexperience
when
they
arrived
at
but
the
fact
that
i
still
slept
at
home
on
saturday
and
sunday
nights
preserved
me
i
fancy
from
many
surprises
there
was
a
crisis
but
it
was
broad
and
slow
for
me
on
the
other
hand
for
my
father
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
was
definite
and
sharp
permission
for
me
to
desert
the
parental
hearth
even
for
five
days
in
certain
weeks
was
tantamount
in
his
mind
to
admitting
that
the
great
scheme
so
long
caressed
so
passionately
fostered
must
in
its
primitive
bigness
be
now
dropped
the
great
scheme
i
can
not
resist
giving
it
the
mortuary
of
capital
letters
had
been
as
my
readers
know
that
i
should
be
exclusively
and
consecutively
dedicated
through
the
whole
of
my
life
the
manifest
and
uninterrupted
and
uncompromised
service
of
the
lord
that
had
been
the
aspiration
of
my
mother
and
at
her
death
she
had
bequeathed
that
desire
to
my
father
like
a
dream
of
the
promised
land
in
their
ecstasy
my
parents
had
taken
me
as
elkanah
and
hannah
had
long
ago
taken
samuel
from
their
of
down
to
sacrifice
to
the
lord
of
hosts
in
shiloh
they
had
girt
me
about
with
a
linen
ephod
and
had
hoped
to
leave
me
there
long
as
he
liveth
they
had
said
shall
be
lent
unto
the
lord
doubtless
in
the
course
of
these
fourteen
years
it
had
occasionally
flashed
upon
my
father
as
he
overheard
some
speech
of
mine
or
detected
some
idiosyncrasy
that
i
was
not
one
of
those
whose
temperament
points
them
out
as
ultimately
fitted
for
an
austere
life
of
religion
what
he
hoped
however
was
that
when
the
little
roughnesses
of
childhood
were
rubbed
away
there
would
pass
a
deep
mellowness
over
my
soul
he
had
a
touching
way
of
condoning
my
faults
of
conduct
directly
after
reproving
them
and
he
would
softly
deprecate
my
frailty
saying
in
a
tone
of
harrowing
tenderness
you
not
the
child
of
many
prayers
he
continued
to
think
that
prayer
such
passionate
importunate
prayer
as
his
must
prevail
faith
could
move
mountains
should
it
not
be
able
to
mould
the
little
ductile
heart
of
a
child
since
he
was
sure
that
his
own
faith
was
unfaltering
he
had
yearned
and
waited
for
a
son
who
should
be
totally
without
human
audacities
who
should
be
humble
pure
not
troubled
by
worldly
agitations
a
son
whose
life
should
be
cleansed
and
straightened
from
above
custodiendo
sermones
in
whom
everything
should
be
sacrificed
except
the
one
thing
needful
to
salvation
how
such
a
marvel
of
lowly
piety
was
to
earn
a
living
had
never
i
think
occurred
to
him
my
father
was
singularly
indifferent
about
money
perhaps
his
notion
was
that
totally
devoid
of
ambitions
as
i
was
to
be
i
should
quietly
become
adult
and
continue
his
ministrations
among
the
poor
of
the
christian
flock
he
had
some
dim
dream
i
think
of
there
being
just
enough
for
us
all
without
my
having
to
take
up
any
business
or
trade
i
believe
it
was
immediately
after
my
first
term
at
that
i
was
a
silent
but
indignant
witness
of
a
conversation
between
my
father
and
thomas
brightwen
my
stepmother
brother
who
was
a
banker
in
one
of
the
eastern
counties
this
question
is
he
to
be
in
a
worldly
sense
was
being
discussed
and
i
am
sure
that
it
was
for
the
first
time
at
all
events
in
my
presence
brightwen
i
fancy
had
been
worked
upon
by
my
stepmother
whose
affection
for
me
was
always
on
the
increase
to
suggest
or
faintly
to
stir
the
air
in
the
neighbourhood
of
suggesting
a
query
about
my
future
he
was
childless
and
so
was
she
and
i
think
a
kind
impulse
led
them
to
the
way
as
it
is
called
i
believe
he
said
that
the
banking
business
wisely
and
honourably
conducted
sometimes
led
as
we
know
that
it
is
apt
to
lead
to
affluence
to
my
horror
my
father
with
rising
emphasis
replied
that
there
were
offered
to
his
beloved
child
what
is
called
an
opening
that
would
lead
to
an
income
of
a
year
and
that
would
divert
his
thoughts
and
interest
from
the
lord
work
he
would
reject
it
on
his
child
behalf
brightwen
a
precise
and
polished
gentleman
who
evidently
never
made
an
exaggerated
statement
in
his
life
was
i
think
faintly
scandalized
he
soon
left
us
and
i
do
not
recollect
his
paying
us
a
second
visit
for
my
silent
part
i
felt
very
much
like
gehazi
and
i
would
fain
have
followed
after
the
banker
if
i
had
dared
to
do
so
into
the
night
i
would
have
excused
to
him
the
ardour
of
my
elisha
and
i
would
have
reminded
him
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
me
i
pray
thee
i
would
have
said
talent
of
silver
and
two
changes
of
garments
it
seemed
to
me
very
hard
that
my
father
should
dispose
of
my
possibilities
of
wealth
in
so
summary
a
fashion
but
the
fact
that
i
did
resent
it
and
regretted
what
i
supposed
to
be
my
shows
how
far
apart
we
had
already
swung
my
father
i
am
convinced
thought
that
he
gave
words
to
my
inward
instincts
when
he
repudiated
the
very
mild
and
inconclusive
benevolence
of
his
but
he
certainly
did
not
do
so
i
was
conscious
of
a
sharp
and
instinctive
disappointment
at
having
had
as
i
fancied
wealth
so
near
my
grasp
and
at
seeing
it
all
cast
violently
into
the
sea
of
my
father
scruples
not
one
of
my
village
friends
attended
the
to
which
i
was
now
attached
and
i
arrived
there
without
an
acquaintance
i
should
soon
however
have
found
a
corner
of
my
own
if
my
father
had
not
unluckily
stipulated
that
i
was
not
to
sleep
in
the
dormitory
with
the
boys
of
my
own
age
but
in
the
room
occupied
by
the
two
elder
sons
of
a
prominent
plymouth
brother
whom
he
knew
from
a
social
point
of
view
this
was
an
unfortunate
arrangement
since
these
youths
were
some
years
older
and
many
years
riper
than
i
the
eldest
in
fact
was
soon
to
leave
they
had
enjoyed
their
independence
and
they
now
greatly
resented
being
saddled
with
the
presence
of
an
unknown
urchin
the
supposition
had
been
that
they
would
protect
and
foster
my
religious
practices
would
encourage
me
indeed
as
my
father
put
it
to
approach
the
throne
of
grace
with
them
at
morning
and
evening
prayer
they
made
no
pretence
however
to
be
considered
godly
they
looked
upon
me
as
an
intruder
and
after
a
while
the
younger
and
ruder
of
them
openly
let
me
know
that
they
believed
i
had
been
put
into
their
room
to
upon
them
it
had
been
a
plot
they
knew
between
their
father
and
mine
and
he
darkly
warned
me
that
i
should
suffer
if
got
out
i
had
however
no
wish
to
trouble
them
nor
any
faint
interest
in
their
affairs
i
soon
discovered
that
they
were
absorbed
in
a
silly
kind
of
amorous
correspondence
with
the
girls
of
a
neighbouring
academy
but
were
all
such
toys
to
me
these
young
fellows
who
ought
long
before
to
have
left
the
school
did
nothing
overtly
unkind
to
me
but
they
condemned
me
to
silence
they
ceased
to
address
me
except
with
an
occasional
command
by
reason
of
my
youth
i
was
in
bed
and
asleep
before
my
companions
arrived
upstairs
and
in
the
morning
i
was
always
routed
up
and
packed
about
my
business
while
they
still
were
drowsing
but
the
fact
that
i
had
been
cut
off
from
my
coevals
by
night
cut
me
off
from
them
also
by
day
so
that
i
was
nothing
to
them
neither
a
boarder
nor
a
neither
flesh
fish
nor
fowl
the
loneliness
of
my
life
was
extreme
and
that
i
always
went
home
on
saturday
afternoon
and
returned
on
monday
morning
still
further
checked
my
companionships
at
school
for
a
long
time
round
the
outskirts
of
that
busy
throng
of
opening
lives
i
lonely
as
a
cloud
and
sometimes
i
was
more
unhappy
than
i
had
ever
been
before
no
one
however
bullied
me
and
though
i
was
dimly
and
indefinably
witness
to
acts
of
uncleanness
and
cruelty
i
was
the
victim
of
no
such
acts
and
the
recipient
of
no
dangerous
confidences
i
suppose
that
my
queer
reputation
for
sanctity
half
dreadful
half
ridiculous
surrounded
me
with
a
atmosphere
we
are
the
victims
of
hallowed
proverbs
and
one
of
the
most
classic
of
these
tells
us
that
child
is
father
of
the
man
but
in
my
case
i
can
not
think
that
this
was
true
in
mature
years
i
have
always
been
gregarious
a
lover
of
my
kind
dependent
upon
the
company
of
friends
for
the
very
pulse
of
moral
life
to
be
marooned
to
be
shut
up
in
a
solitary
cell
to
inhabit
a
lighthouse
or
to
camp
alone
in
a
forest
these
have
always
seemed
to
me
afflictions
too
heavy
to
be
borne
even
in
imagination
a
state
in
which
conversation
exists
not
is
for
me
an
air
too
empty
of
oxygen
for
my
lungs
to
breathe
it
yet
when
i
look
back
upon
my
days
at
i
see
myself
unattracted
by
any
of
the
human
beings
around
me
my
years
are
made
luminous
to
me
in
memory
by
the
ardent
faces
of
my
friends
but
i
can
scarce
recall
so
much
as
the
names
of
more
than
two
or
three
of
my
schoolfellows
there
is
not
one
of
them
whose
mind
or
whose
character
made
any
lasting
impression
upon
me
in
later
life
i
have
been
impatient
of
solitude
and
afraid
of
it
at
school
i
asked
for
no
more
than
to
slip
out
of
the
and
be
alone
with
my
reflections
and
my
fancies
that
magnetism
of
humanity
which
has
been
the
agony
of
mature
years
of
this
i
had
not
a
trace
when
i
was
a
boy
of
those
fragile
loves
to
which
most
men
look
back
with
tenderness
and
passion
emotions
to
be
explained
only
as
montaigne
explained
them
lui
parceque
i
knew
nothing
i
to
whom
friendship
has
since
been
like
sunlight
and
like
sleep
left
school
unbrightened
and
unrefreshed
by
commerce
with
a
single
friend
if
i
had
been
clever
i
should
doubtless
have
attracted
the
jealousy
of
my
fellows
but
i
was
spared
this
by
the
mediocrity
of
my
success
in
the
classes
one
little
fact
i
may
mention
because
it
exemplifies
the
advance
in
observation
which
has
been
made
in
forty
years
i
was
extremely
nearsighted
and
in
consequence
was
placed
at
a
gross
disadvantage
by
being
unable
to
see
the
slate
or
the
on
which
our
tasks
were
explained
it
seems
almost
incredible
when
one
reflects
upon
it
but
during
the
whole
of
my
school
life
this
fact
was
never
commented
upon
or
taken
into
account
by
a
single
person
until
the
polish
lady
who
taught
us
the
elements
of
german
and
french
drew
someone
attention
to
it
in
my
sixteenth
year
i
was
not
quick
but
i
passed
for
being
denser
than
i
was
because
of
the
myopic
haze
that
enveloped
me
but
this
is
not
an
autobiography
and
with
the
cold
and
shrouded
details
of
my
uninteresting
school
life
i
will
not
fatigue
the
reader
i
was
not
content
however
to
be
the
cipher
that
i
found
myself
and
when
i
had
been
at
school
for
about
a
year
i
out
greatly
i
think
to
my
own
surprise
in
a
popular
act
we
had
a
young
usher
whom
we
disliked
i
suppose
poor
phthisic
lad
that
he
was
the
most
miserable
of
us
all
he
was
i
think
unfitted
for
the
task
which
had
been
forced
upon
him
he
was
fretful
unsympathetic
agitated
the
an
old
rambling
place
possessed
a
long
room
that
opened
from
our
general
corridor
and
was
lighted
by
deep
windows
carefully
barred
which
looked
into
an
inner
garden
this
vault
was
devoted
to
us
and
to
our
by
a
tacit
law
no
master
entered
it
one
evening
just
at
dusk
a
great
number
of
us
were
here
when
the
bell
for
rang
and
many
of
us
dawdled
at
the
summons
tactless
in
his
anger
bustled
in
among
us
scolding
in
a
shrill
voice
and
proceeded
to
drive
us
forth
i
was
the
latest
to
emerge
and
as
he
turned
away
to
see
if
any
other
truant
might
not
be
hiding
i
determined
upon
action
with
a
quick
movement
i
drew
the
door
behind
me
and
bolted
it
just
in
time
to
hear
the
imprisoned
usher
scream
with
vexation
we
boys
all
trooped
upstairs
and
it
is
characteristic
of
my
isolation
that
i
had
not
one
to
whom
i
could
confide
my
feat
that
had
been
shut
in
became
however
almost
instantly
known
and
the
usually
so
unruly
was
awed
by
the
event
into
exemplary
decorum
there
with
no
master
near
us
in
a
silence
rarely
broken
by
a
giggle
or
a
catcall
we
sat
diligently
working
or
pretending
to
work
through
my
brain
as
i
hung
over
my
book
a
thousand
new
thoughts
began
to
surge
i
was
the
liberator
the
tyrannicide
i
had
freed
all
my
fellows
from
the
odious
oppressor
surely
when
they
learned
that
it
was
i
they
would
cluster
round
me
surely
now
i
should
be
somebody
in
the
no
longer
a
mere
trotting
shadow
or
invisible
presence
the
interval
seemed
long
at
length
was
released
by
a
servant
and
he
came
up
into
the
to
find
us
in
that
ominous
condition
of
suspense
at
first
he
said
nothing
he
sank
upon
a
chair
in
a
attitude
while
he
pressed
his
hand
to
his
side
his
distress
and
silence
redoubled
the
boys
surprise
and
filled
me
with
something
like
remorse
for
the
first
time
i
reflected
that
he
was
human
that
perhaps
he
suffered
he
rose
presently
and
took
a
slate
upon
which
he
wrote
two
questions
you
do
it
you
know
who
did
and
these
he
propounded
to
each
boy
in
rotation
the
prompt
redoubled
in
every
case
seemed
to
pile
up
his
despair
one
of
the
last
to
whom
he
held
in
silence
the
trembling
slate
was
the
perpetrator
as
i
saw
the
moment
approach
an
unspeakable
timidity
swept
over
me
i
reflected
that
no
one
had
seen
me
that
no
one
could
accuse
me
nothing
could
be
easier
or
safer
than
to
deny
nothing
more
perplexing
to
the
enemy
nothing
less
perilous
for
the
culprit
a
flood
of
plausible
reasons
invaded
my
brain
i
seemed
to
see
this
to
be
a
case
in
which
to
tell
the
truth
would
be
not
merely
foolish
it
would
be
wrong
yet
when
the
usher
stood
before
me
holding
the
slate
out
in
his
white
and
shaking
hand
i
seized
the
pencil
and
ignoring
the
first
question
i
wrote
firmly
against
the
second
i
suppose
that
the
ambiguity
of
this
action
puzzled
b
he
pressed
me
to
answer
you
do
it
but
to
that
i
was
obstinately
dumb
and
away
i
was
hurried
to
an
empty
where
for
the
whole
of
that
night
and
the
next
day
i
was
held
a
prisoner
visited
at
intervals
by
the
headmaster
and
other
inquisitorial
persons
until
i
was
gradually
persuaded
to
make
a
full
confession
and
apology
this
absurd
little
incident
had
one
effect
it
revealed
me
to
my
schoolfellows
as
an
existence
from
that
time
forth
i
lay
no
longer
under
the
stigma
of
invisibility
i
had
produced
my
material
shape
and
had
thrown
my
shadow
for
a
moment
into
a
legend
but
in
other
respects
things
went
on
much
as
before
curiously
uninfluenced
by
my
surroundings
i
in
my
turn
failed
to
exercise
influence
and
my
practical
isolation
was
no
less
than
it
had
been
before
it
was
thus
that
it
came
about
that
my
social
memories
of
my
life
are
monotonous
and
vague
it
was
a
period
during
which
as
it
appears
to
me
now
on
looking
back
the
stream
of
my
spiritual
nature
spread
out
into
a
shallow
pool
which
was
almost
stagnant
i
was
labouring
to
gain
those
elements
of
conventional
knowledge
which
had
in
many
cases
up
to
that
time
been
singularly
lacking
but
my
brain
was
starved
and
my
intellectual
perceptions
were
veiled
elder
persons
who
in
later
years
would
speak
to
me
frankly
of
my
assured
me
that
while
i
had
often
struck
them
as
a
smart
and
quaint
and
even
interesting
child
all
promise
seemed
to
fade
out
of
me
as
a
schoolboy
and
that
those
who
were
most
inclined
to
be
indulgent
gave
up
the
hope
that
i
should
prove
a
man
in
a
way
remarkable
this
was
particularly
the
case
with
the
most
indulgent
of
my
protectors
my
refined
and
gentle
stepmother
as
this
record
can
however
have
no
value
that
is
not
based
on
its
rigorous
adhesion
to
the
truth
i
am
bound
to
say
that
the
dreariness
and
sterility
of
my
were
more
apparent
than
real
i
was
pursuing
certain
lines
of
moral
and
mental
development
all
the
time
and
since
my
schoolmasters
and
my
schoolfellows
combined
in
thinking
me
so
dull
i
will
display
a
tardy
touch
of
spirit
and
ask
whether
it
may
not
partly
have
been
because
they
were
themselves
so
commonplace
i
think
that
if
some
drops
of
sympathy
that
magic
dew
of
paradise
had
fallen
upon
my
desert
it
might
have
blossomed
like
the
rose
or
at
all
events
like
that
chimerical
flower
the
rose
of
jericho
as
it
was
the
conventionality
around
me
the
intellectual
drought
gave
me
no
opportunity
of
outward
growth
they
did
not
destroy
but
they
cooped
up
and
rendered
slow
and
inefficient
that
internal
life
which
continued
as
i
have
said
to
live
on
unseen
this
took
the
form
of
dreams
and
speculations
in
the
course
of
which
i
went
through
many
tortuous
processes
of
the
mind
the
actual
aims
of
which
were
futile
although
the
movements
themselves
were
useful
if
i
may
more
minutely
define
my
meaning
i
would
say
that
in
my
schooldays
without
possessing
thoughts
i
yet
prepared
my
mind
for
thinking
and
learned
how
to
think
the
great
subject
of
my
curiosity
at
this
time
was
words
as
instruments
of
expression
i
was
incessant
in
adding
to
my
vocabulary
and
in
finding
accurate
and
individual
terms
for
things
here
too
the
exercise
preceded
the
employment
since
i
was
busy
providing
myself
with
words
before
i
had
any
ideas
to
express
with
them
when
i
read
shakespeare
and
came
upon
the
passage
in
which
prospero
tells
caliban
that
he
had
no
thoughts
until
his
master
taught
him
words
i
remember
starting
with
amazement
at
the
poet
intuition
for
such
a
caliban
had
i
been
i
pitied
thee
took
pains
to
make
thee
speak
taught
thee
each
hour
one
thing
or
other
when
thou
didst
not
savage
know
thine
own
meaning
but
wouldst
gabble
like
a
thing
most
brutish
i
endow
thy
purposes
with
words
that
made
them
know
for
my
prosperos
i
sought
vaguely
in
such
books
as
i
had
access
to
and
i
was
conscious
that
as
the
inevitable
word
seized
hold
of
me
with
it
out
of
the
darkness
into
strong
light
came
the
image
and
the
idea
my
father
possessed
a
copy
of
bailey
dictionary
a
book
published
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
over
this
i
would
pore
for
hours
playing
with
the
words
in
a
fashion
which
i
can
no
longer
reconstruct
and
delighting
in
the
savour
of
the
rich
country
phrases
my
father
finding
me
thus
employed
fell
to
wondering
at
the
nature
of
my
pursuit
and
i
could
offer
him
indeed
no
very
intelligible
explanation
of
it
he
urged
me
to
give
up
such
idleness
and
to
make
practical
use
of
language
for
this
purpose
he
conceived
an
exercise
which
he
obliged
me
to
adopt
although
it
was
hateful
to
me
he
sent
me
forth
it
might
be
up
the
lane
to
warbury
hill
and
round
home
by
the
copses
or
else
down
one
chine
to
the
sea
and
along
the
shingle
to
the
next
cutting
in
the
cliff
and
so
back
by
way
of
the
village
and
he
desired
me
to
put
down
in
language
as
full
as
i
could
all
that
i
had
seen
in
each
excursion
as
i
have
said
this
practice
was
detestable
and
irksome
to
me
but
as
i
look
back
i
am
inclined
to
believe
it
to
have
been
the
most
salutary
the
most
practical
piece
of
training
which
my
father
ever
gave
me
it
forced
me
to
observe
sharply
and
clearly
to
form
visual
impressions
to
retain
them
in
the
brain
and
to
clothe
them
in
punctilious
and
accurate
language
it
was
in
my
fifteenth
year
that
i
became
again
this
time
intelligently
acquainted
with
shakespeare
i
got
hold
of
a
single
play
in
a
school
edition
prepared
i
suppose
for
one
of
the
university
examinations
which
were
then
being
instituted
in
the
provinces
this
i
read
through
and
through
not
disdaining
the
help
of
the
notes
and
revelling
in
the
glossary
i
studied
as
i
had
hitherto
studied
no
classic
work
and
it
filled
my
whole
being
with
music
and
romance
this
book
was
my
own
hoarded
possession
the
rest
of
shakespeare
works
were
beyond
my
hopes
but
gradually
i
contrived
to
borrow
a
volume
here
and
a
volume
there
i
completed
merchant
of
read
and
most
of
the
others
i
think
remained
closed
to
me
for
a
long
time
but
these
were
enough
to
steep
my
horizon
with
all
the
colours
of
sunrise
it
was
due
no
doubt
to
my
bringing
up
that
the
plays
never
appealed
to
me
as
bounded
by
the
exigencies
of
a
stage
or
played
by
actors
the
images
they
raised
in
my
mind
were
of
real
people
moving
in
the
open
air
and
uttering
in
the
natural
play
of
life
sentiments
that
were
clothed
in
the
most
lovely
and
yet
as
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
obvious
and
the
most
inevitable
language
it
was
while
i
was
thus
under
the
full
spell
of
the
shakespearean
necromancy
that
a
significant
event
occurred
my
father
took
me
up
to
london
for
the
first
time
since
my
infancy
our
visit
was
one
of
a
few
days
only
and
its
purpose
was
that
we
might
take
part
in
some
enormous
evangelical
conference
we
stayed
in
a
dark
hotel
off
the
strand
where
i
found
the
noise
by
day
and
night
very
afflicting
when
we
were
not
at
the
conference
i
spent
long
hours
among
crumbs
and
bluebottle
flies
in
the
of
this
hotel
my
father
being
busy
at
the
british
museum
and
the
royal
society
the
conference
was
held
in
an
immense
hall
somewhere
in
the
north
of
london
i
remember
my
sense
of
the
terrible
vastness
of
the
crowd
with
rings
on
rings
of
dim
white
faces
fading
in
the
fog
my
father
as
a
privileged
visitor
was
obliged
with
seats
on
the
platform
and
we
were
in
the
heart
of
the
first
really
large
assemblage
of
persons
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
interminable
ritual
of
prayers
hymns
and
addresses
left
no
impression
on
my
memory
but
my
attention
was
suddenly
stung
into
life
by
a
remark
an
elderly
man
fat
and
greasy
with
a
voice
like
a
bassoon
and
an
imperturbable
assurance
was
denouncing
the
spread
of
infidelity
and
the
lukewarmness
of
professing
christians
who
refrained
from
battling
with
the
wickedness
at
their
doors
they
were
like
the
laodiceans
whom
the
angel
of
the
apocalypse
spewed
out
of
his
mouth
for
instance
who
the
orator
asked
is
now
rising
to
check
the
outburst
of
idolatry
in
our
midst
this
very
moment
he
went
on
is
proceeding
unreproved
a
blasphemous
celebration
of
the
birth
of
shakespeare
a
lost
soul
now
suffering
for
his
sins
in
hell
my
sensation
was
that
of
one
who
has
suddenly
been
struck
on
the
head
stars
and
sparks
beat
around
me
if
some
person
i
loved
had
been
grossly
insulted
in
my
presence
i
could
not
have
felt
more
powerless
in
anguish
no
one
in
that
vast
audience
raised
a
word
of
protest
and
my
spirits
fell
to
their
nadir
this
be
it
remarked
was
the
earliest
intimation
that
had
reached
me
of
the
tercentenary
of
the
birth
at
stratford
and
i
had
not
the
least
idea
what
could
have
provoked
the
outburst
of
outraged
godliness
but
shakespeare
was
certainly
in
the
air
when
we
returned
to
the
hotel
that
noon
my
father
of
his
own
accord
reverted
to
the
subject
i
held
my
breath
prepared
to
endure
fresh
torment
what
he
said
however
surprised
and
relieved
me
so
and
so
he
remarked
not
in
my
judgement
justified
in
saying
what
he
did
the
uncovenanted
mercies
of
god
are
not
revealed
to
us
before
so
rashly
speaking
of
shakespeare
as
a
lost
soul
in
hell
he
should
have
remembered
how
little
we
know
of
the
history
the
light
of
salvation
was
widely
disseminated
in
the
land
during
the
reign
of
queen
elizabeth
and
we
can
not
know
that
shakespeare
did
not
accept
the
atonement
of
christ
in
simple
faith
before
he
came
to
die
the
concession
will
today
seem
meagre
to
gay
and
worldly
spirits
but
words
can
not
express
how
comfortable
it
was
to
me
i
gazed
at
my
father
with
loving
eyes
across
the
cheese
and
celery
and
if
the
waiter
had
not
been
present
i
believe
i
might
have
hugged
him
in
my
arms
this
anecdote
may
serve
to
illustrate
the
attitude
of
my
conscience
at
this
time
with
regard
to
theology
i
was
not
consciously
in
any
revolt
against
the
strict
faith
in
which
i
had
been
brought
up
but
i
could
not
fail
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
literature
tempted
me
to
stray
up
innumerable
paths
which
meandered
in
directions
at
right
angles
to
that
direct
strait
way
which
leadeth
to
salvation
i
fancied
if
i
may
pursue
the
image
that
i
was
still
safe
up
these
pleasant
lanes
if
i
did
not
stray
far
enough
to
lose
sight
of
the
main
road
if
for
instance
it
had
been
quite
certain
that
shakespeare
had
been
irrecoverably
damnable
and
damned
it
would
scarcely
have
been
possible
for
me
to
have
justified
myself
in
going
on
reading
one
who
broke
bread
with
the
saints
every
sunday
morning
who
a
class
at
sunday
school
who
made
as
my
father
loved
to
remind
me
a
public
weekly
confession
of
his
willingness
to
bear
the
cross
of
christ
such
an
one
could
hardly
however
bewildering
and
torturing
the
thought
continue
to
admire
a
lost
soul
but
that
happy
possibility
of
an
ultimate
repentance
how
it
eased
me
i
could
always
console
myself
with
the
belief
that
when
shakespeare
wrote
any
passage
of
intoxicating
beauty
it
was
just
then
that
he
was
beginning
to
breathe
the
rapture
that
faith
in
christ
brings
to
the
anointed
soul
and
it
was
with
a
like
casuistry
that
i
condoned
my
other
intellectual
and
personal
pleasures
my
father
continued
to
be
under
the
impression
that
my
school
which
he
never
again
visited
after
originally
leaving
me
there
was
conducted
upon
the
same
principles
as
his
own
household
i
was
frequently
tempted
to
enlighten
him
but
i
never
found
the
courage
to
do
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
piety
of
the
establishment
which
collected
to
it
the
sons
of
a
large
number
of
evangelically
minded
parents
throughout
that
part
of
the
country
resided
mainly
in
the
prospectus
it
proceeded
no
further
than
the
practice
of
reading
the
bible
aloud
each
boy
in
successive
order
one
verse
in
the
early
morning
before
breakfast
there
was
no
selection
and
no
exposition
where
the
last
boy
sat
there
the
day
reading
ended
even
if
it
were
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
there
it
began
next
morning
such
reading
of
chapter
was
followed
by
a
long
dry
prayer
i
do
not
know
that
this
morning
service
would
appear
more
perfunctory
than
usual
to
other
boys
but
it
astounded
and
disgusted
me
accustomed
as
i
was
to
the
ministrations
at
home
where
my
father
read
word
of
god
in
a
loud
passionate
voice
with
dramatic
emphasis
pausing
for
commentary
and
paraphrase
and
treating
every
phrase
as
if
it
were
part
of
a
personal
message
or
of
thrilling
family
history
at
school
prayer
was
a
dreary
unintelligible
exercise
and
with
this
piece
of
religion
for
the
day
began
and
ended
the
discretion
of
little
boys
is
extraordinary
i
am
quite
certain
no
one
of
us
ever
revealed
this
fact
to
our
godly
parents
at
home
if
any
one
was
to
do
this
it
was
of
course
i
who
should
first
of
all
have
but
i
had
grown
cautious
about
making
confidences
one
never
knew
how
awkwardly
they
might
develop
or
to
what
disturbing
excesses
of
zeal
they
might
precipitously
lead
i
was
on
my
guard
against
my
father
who
was
all
the
time
only
too
openly
yearning
that
i
should
approach
him
for
help
for
comfort
for
ghostly
counsel
still
though
steadily
gaining
in
solidity
of
constitution
i
was
liable
to
severe
chills
and
to
fugitive
neuralgic
pangs
my
father
was
almost
maddeningly
desirous
that
these
afflictions
should
be
sanctified
to
me
and
it
was
in
my
bed
often
when
i
was
much
bowed
in
spirit
by
indisposition
that
he
used
to
triumph
over
me
most
pitilessly
he
retained
the
singular
superstition
amazing
in
a
man
of
scientific
knowledge
and
long
human
experience
that
all
pains
and
ailments
were
directly
sent
by
the
lord
in
chastisement
for
some
definite
fault
and
not
in
relation
to
any
physical
cause
the
result
was
sometimes
quite
startling
and
in
particular
i
recollect
that
my
stepmother
and
i
exchanged
impressions
of
astonishment
at
my
father
action
when
goodyer
who
was
one
of
the
and
the
wife
of
a
young
journeyman
cobbler
broke
her
leg
my
father
puzzled
for
an
instant
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
accident
since
goodyer
was
the
gentlest
and
most
inoffensive
of
our
church
members
decided
that
it
must
be
because
she
had
made
an
idol
of
her
husband
and
he
reduced
the
poor
thing
to
tears
by
standing
at
her
and
imploring
the
holy
spirit
to
bring
this
sin
home
to
her
conscience
when
therefore
i
was
ill
at
home
with
one
of
my
trifling
disorders
the
problem
of
my
spiritual
state
always
pressed
violently
upon
my
father
and
this
caused
me
no
little
mental
uneasiness
he
would
appear
at
my
bedside
with
solemn
solicitude
and
sinking
on
his
knees
would
earnestly
pray
aloud
that
the
purpose
of
the
lord
in
sending
me
this
affliction
might
graciously
be
made
plain
to
me
and
then
rising
and
standing
by
my
pillow
he
would
put
me
through
a
searching
spiritual
inquiry
as
to
the
fault
which
was
thus
divinely
indicated
to
me
as
observed
and
reprobated
on
high
it
was
not
on
points
of
moral
behaviour
that
he
thus
examined
me
i
think
he
disdained
such
ignoble
game
as
that
but
uncertainties
of
doctrine
relinquishment
of
faith
in
the
purity
of
this
dogma
or
of
that
lukewarm
zeal
in
up
the
cross
of
christ
growth
of
intellectual
pride
such
were
the
insidious
offences
in
consequence
of
which
as
he
supposed
the
cold
in
the
head
or
the
toothache
had
been
sent
as
heavenly
messengers
to
recall
my
straggling
conscience
to
its
plain
path
of
duty
what
made
me
very
uncomfortable
on
these
occasions
was
my
consciousness
that
confinement
to
bed
was
hardly
an
affliction
at
all
it
kept
me
from
the
boredom
of
school
in
a
bedroom
at
home
with
my
pretty
smiling
stepmother
lavishing
luxurious
attendance
upon
me
and
it
gave
me
long
unbroken
days
for
reading
i
was
awkwardly
aware
that
i
simply
had
not
the
effrontery
to
the
throne
of
grace
with
a
request
to
know
for
what
sin
i
was
condemned
to
such
a
very
pleasant
disposition
of
my
hours
the
current
of
my
life
ran
during
my
schooldays
most
merrily
and
fully
in
the
holidays
when
i
resumed
my
outdoor
exercises
with
those
friends
in
the
village
of
whom
i
have
spoken
earlier
i
think
they
were
more
refined
and
better
bred
than
any
of
my
schoolfellows
at
all
events
it
was
among
these
homely
companions
alone
that
i
continued
to
form
congenial
and
sympathetic
relations
in
one
of
these
boys
one
of
whom
i
have
heard
or
seen
nothing
now
for
nearly
a
generation
i
found
tastes
singularly
parallel
to
my
own
and
we
scoured
the
horizon
in
search
of
books
in
prose
and
verse
but
particularly
in
verse
as
i
grew
stronger
in
muscle
i
was
capable
of
adding
considerably
to
my
income
by
an
exercise
of
my
legs
i
was
allowed
money
for
the
railway
ticket
between
the
town
where
the
school
lay
and
the
station
nearest
to
my
home
but
if
i
chose
to
walk
six
or
seven
miles
along
the
coast
thus
more
than
halving
the
distance
by
rail
from
school
house
to
home
i
might
spend
as
pocket
money
the
railway
fare
i
thus
saved
such
considerable
sums
i
fostered
in
order
to
buy
with
them
editions
of
the
poets
these
were
not
in
those
days
as
they
are
now
at
the
beck
and
call
of
every
purse
and
the
attainment
of
each
little
masterpiece
was
a
separate
triumph
in
particular
i
shall
never
forget
the
excitement
of
reaching
at
length
the
exorbitant
price
the
bookseller
asked
for
the
only
although
imperfect
edition
of
the
poems
of
coleridge
at
last
i
could
meet
his
demand
and
my
friend
and
i
went
down
to
consummate
the
solemn
purchase
coming
away
with
our
treasure
we
read
aloud
from
the
orange
coloured
volume
in
turns
as
we
strolled
along
until
at
last
we
sat
down
on
the
bulging
root
of
an
elm
tree
in
a
secluded
lane
here
we
stayed
in
a
sort
of
poetical
nirvana
reading
reading
forgetting
the
passage
of
time
until
the
hour
of
our
neglected
meal
was
a
long
while
past
and
we
had
to
hurry
home
to
bread
and
cheese
and
a
scolding
there
was
occasionally
some
trouble
about
my
reading
but
now
not
much
nor
often
i
was
rather
adroit
and
careful
not
to
bring
prominently
into
sight
anything
of
a
literary
kind
which
could
become
a
stone
of
stumbling
but
when
i
was
nearly
sixteen
i
made
a
purchase
which
brought
me
into
sad
trouble
and
was
the
cause
of
a
permanent
wound
to
my
i
had
long
coveted
in
the
bookshop
window
a
volume
in
which
the
poetical
works
of
ben
jonson
and
christopher
marlowe
were
said
to
be
combined
this
i
bought
at
length
and
i
carried
it
with
me
to
devour
as
i
trod
the
desolate
road
that
brought
me
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
on
saturday
afternoons
of
ben
jonson
i
could
make
nothing
but
when
i
turned
to
and
leander
i
was
lifted
to
a
heaven
of
passion
and
music
it
was
a
marvellous
revelation
of
romantic
beauty
to
me
and
as
i
paced
along
that
lonely
and
exquisite
highway
with
its
immense
command
of
the
sea
and
its
peeps
every
now
and
then
through
slanting
thickets
far
down
to
the
white
shingle
i
lifted
up
my
voice
singing
the
verses
as
i
strolled
along
buskins
of
shells
all
silver
used
she
and
branch
with
blushing
coral
to
the
knee
where
sparrows
perched
of
hollow
pearl
and
gold
such
as
the
world
would
wonder
to
behold
so
it
went
on
and
i
thought
i
had
never
read
anything
so
lovely
amorous
leander
beautiful
and
young
whose
tragedy
divine
musaeus
sung
it
all
seemed
to
my
fancy
intoxicating
beyond
anything
i
had
ever
even
dreamed
of
since
i
had
not
yet
become
acquainted
with
any
of
the
modern
romanticists
when
i
reached
home
tired
out
with
enthusiasm
and
exercise
i
must
needs
so
soon
as
i
had
eaten
search
out
my
stepmother
that
she
might
be
a
partner
in
my
joys
it
is
remarkable
to
me
now
and
a
disconcerting
proof
of
my
still
almost
infantile
innocence
that
having
induced
her
to
settle
to
her
knitting
i
began
without
hesitation
to
read
marlowe
voluptuous
poem
aloud
to
that
blameless
christian
gentlewoman
we
got
on
very
well
in
the
opening
but
at
the
episode
of
cupid
pining
my
needles
began
nervously
to
clash
and
when
we
launched
on
the
description
of
leander
person
she
interrupted
me
by
saying
rather
sharply
me
that
book
please
i
should
like
to
read
the
rest
to
myself
i
resigned
the
reading
in
amazement
and
was
stupefied
to
see
her
take
the
volume
shut
it
with
a
snap
and
hide
it
under
her
needlework
nor
could
i
extract
from
her
another
word
on
the
subject
the
matter
passed
from
my
mind
and
i
was
therefore
extremely
alarmed
when
soon
after
my
going
to
bed
that
night
my
father
came
into
my
room
with
a
pale
face
and
burning
eyes
the
prey
of
violent
perturbation
he
set
down
the
candle
and
stood
by
the
bed
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
resolve
on
a
form
of
speech
then
he
denounced
me
in
unmeasured
terms
for
bringing
into
the
house
for
possessing
at
all
or
reading
so
abominable
a
book
he
explained
that
my
stepmother
had
shown
it
to
him
and
that
he
had
looked
through
it
and
had
burned
it
the
sentence
in
his
tirade
which
principally
affected
me
was
this
he
said
will
soon
be
leaving
us
and
going
up
to
lodgings
in
london
and
if
your
landlady
should
come
into
your
room
and
find
such
a
book
lying
about
she
would
immediately
set
you
down
as
a
profligate
i
did
not
understand
this
at
all
and
it
seems
to
me
now
that
the
fact
that
i
had
so
very
simply
and
childishly
volunteered
to
read
the
verses
to
my
stepmother
should
have
proved
to
my
father
that
i
connected
it
with
no
ideas
of
an
immoral
nature
i
was
greatly
wounded
and
offended
but
my
indignation
was
smothered
up
in
the
alarm
and
excitement
which
followed
the
news
that
i
was
to
go
up
to
live
in
lodgings
and
as
it
was
evident
alone
in
london
of
this
no
hint
or
whisper
had
previously
reached
me
on
reflection
i
can
but
admit
that
my
father
who
was
little
accustomed
to
literature
must
have
come
across
some
startling
exposures
in
ben
jonson
and
probably
never
reached
and
leander
at
all
the
artistic
effect
of
such
poetry
on
an
innocently
pagan
mind
did
not
come
within
the
circle
of
his
experience
he
judged
the
outspoken
elizabethan
poets
no
doubt
very
much
in
the
spirit
of
the
problematical
landlady
of
the
world
outside
of
the
dim
wild
whirlpool
of
london
i
was
much
afraid
but
i
was
now
ready
to
be
willing
to
leave
the
narrow
devonshire
circle
to
see
the
last
of
the
red
mud
of
the
dreary
village
street
of
the
plethoric
elders
to
hear
the
last
of
the
drawling
voices
of
the
yet
i
had
a
great
difficulty
in
persuading
myself
that
i
could
ever
be
happy
away
from
home
and
again
i
compared
my
lot
with
that
of
one
of
the
speckled
that
roamed
about
in
my
father
aquarium
dragging
after
them
great
they
if
by
chance
they
were
turned
out
of
their
trailed
about
a
pale
soft
body
in
search
of
another
house
visibly
and
the
victims
of
every
ignominious
accident
my
spirits
were
divided
pathetically
between
the
wish
to
stay
on
a
guarded
child
and
to
proceed
into
the
world
a
budding
man
and
in
my
utter
ignorance
i
sought
in
vain
to
conjure
up
what
my
immediate
future
would
be
my
father
threw
no
light
upon
the
subject
for
he
had
not
formed
any
definite
idea
of
what
i
could
possibly
do
to
earn
an
honest
living
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
to
stay
another
year
at
school
and
home
this
last
year
of
my
boyish
life
passed
rapidly
and
pleasantly
my
sluggish
brain
waked
up
at
last
and
i
was
able
to
study
with
application
in
the
public
examinations
i
did
pretty
well
and
may
even
have
been
thought
something
of
a
credit
to
the
school
yet
i
formed
no
close
associations
and
i
even
contrived
to
avoid
as
i
had
afterwards
occasion
to
regret
such
lessons
as
were
distasteful
to
me
and
therefore
particularly
valuable
but
i
read
with
unchecked
voracity
and
in
several
curious
directions
shakespeare
now
passed
into
my
possession
entire
in
the
shape
of
a
reprint
more
hideous
and
more
offensive
to
the
eyesight
than
would
in
these
days
appear
conceivable
i
made
acquaintance
with
keats
who
entirely
captivated
me
with
shelley
whose
mab
at
first
repelled
me
from
the
threshold
of
his
edifice
and
with
wordsworth
for
the
exercise
of
whose
magic
i
was
still
far
too
young
my
father
presented
me
with
the
entire
bulk
of
southey
stony
verse
which
i
found
it
impossible
to
penetrate
but
my
stepmother
lent
me
golden
in
which
almost
everything
seemed
exquisite
upon
this
extension
of
my
intellectual
powers
however
there
did
not
follow
any
spirit
of
doubt
or
hostility
to
the
faith
on
the
contrary
at
first
there
came
a
considerable
quickening
of
fervour
my
prayers
became
less
frigid
and
mechanical
i
no
longer
avoided
as
far
as
possible
the
contemplation
of
religious
ideas
i
began
to
search
the
scriptures
for
myself
with
interest
and
sympathy
if
scarcely
with
ardour
i
began
to
perceive
without
animosity
the
strange
narrowness
of
my
father
system
which
seemed
to
take
into
consideration
only
a
selected
circle
of
persons
a
group
of
disciples
peculiarly
illuminated
and
to
have
no
message
whatever
for
the
wider
christian
community
on
this
subject
i
had
some
instructive
conversations
with
my
father
whom
i
found
not
reluctant
to
have
his
convictions
pushed
to
their
logical
extremity
he
did
not
wish
to
judge
he
protested
but
he
could
not
admit
that
a
single
unitarian
or
as
he
preferred
to
say
could
possibly
be
redeemed
and
he
had
no
hope
of
eternal
salvation
for
the
inhabitants
of
catholic
countries
i
recollect
his
speaking
of
austria
he
questioned
whether
a
single
austrian
subject
except
as
he
said
here
and
there
a
pious
and
extremely
ignorant
individual
who
had
not
comprehended
the
errors
of
the
papacy
but
had
humbly
studied
his
bible
could
hope
to
find
eternal
life
he
thought
that
the
ordinary
chinaman
or
savage
native
of
fiji
had
a
better
chance
of
salvation
than
any
cardinal
in
the
vatican
and
even
in
the
priesthood
of
the
church
of
england
he
believed
that
while
many
were
called
few
indeed
would
be
found
to
have
been
chosen
i
could
not
sympathize
even
in
my
then
state
of
ignorance
with
so
rigid
a
conception
of
the
divine
mercy
little
inclined
as
i
was
to
be
sceptical
i
still
thought
it
impossible
that
a
secret
of
such
stupendous
importance
should
have
been
entrusted
to
a
little
group
of
plymouth
brethren
and
have
been
hidden
from
millions
of
disinterested
and
pious
theologians
that
the
leaders
of
european
christianity
were
sincere
my
father
did
not
attempt
to
question
but
they
were
all
of
them
wrong
and
no
matter
how
holy
their
lives
how
their
actions
they
would
have
to
suffer
for
their
inexactitude
through
aeons
of
undefined
torment
he
would
speak
with
a
solemn
complacency
of
the
aged
nun
who
after
a
long
life
of
renunciation
and
devotion
died
at
last
to
discover
her
mistake
he
who
was
so
that
he
could
not
bear
to
witness
the
pain
or
distress
of
any
person
however
disagreeable
or
undeserving
was
quite
acquiescent
in
believing
that
god
would
punish
human
beings
in
millions
for
ever
for
a
purely
intellectual
error
of
comprehension
my
father
inconsistencies
of
perception
seem
to
me
to
have
been
the
result
of
a
curious
irregularity
of
equipment
taking
for
granted
as
he
did
the
absolute
integrity
of
the
scriptures
and
applying
to
them
his
trained
scientific
spirit
he
contrived
to
stifle
with
a
deplorable
success
alike
the
function
of
the
imagination
the
sense
of
moral
justice
and
his
own
deep
and
instinctive
tenderness
of
heart
there
presently
came
over
me
a
strong
desire
to
know
what
doctrine
indeed
it
was
that
the
other
churches
taught
i
expressed
a
wish
to
be
made
aware
of
the
practices
of
rome
or
at
least
of
canterbury
and
i
longed
to
attend
the
anglican
and
the
roman
services
but
to
do
so
was
impossible
my
father
did
not
indeed
forbid
me
to
enter
the
fine
parish
church
of
our
village
or
the
stately
puginesque
cathedral
which
rome
had
just
erected
at
its
side
but
i
knew
that
i
could
not
be
seen
at
either
service
without
his
immediately
knowing
it
or
without
his
being
deeply
wounded
although
i
was
sixteen
years
of
age
and
although
i
was
treated
with
indulgence
and
affection
i
was
still
but
a
bird
fluttering
in
the
of
my
father
will
and
incapable
of
the
smallest
independent
action
i
resigned
all
thought
of
attending
any
other
services
than
those
at
our
but
i
did
no
longer
regard
this
exclusion
as
a
final
one
i
bowed
but
it
was
in
the
house
of
rimmon
from
which
i
now
knew
that
i
must
inevitably
escape
all
the
liberation
however
which
i
desired
or
dreamed
of
was
only
just
so
much
as
would
bring
me
into
communion
with
the
outer
world
of
christianity
without
divesting
me
of
the
pure
and
simple
principles
of
faith
of
so
much
emancipation
indeed
i
now
became
ardently
desirous
and
in
the
contemplation
of
it
i
rose
to
a
more
considerable
degree
of
religious
fervour
than
i
had
ever
reached
before
or
was
ever
to
experience
later
our
thoughts
were
at
this
time
abundantly
exercised
with
the
expectation
of
the
immediate
coming
of
the
lord
who
as
my
father
and
those
who
thought
with
him
believed
would
suddenly
appear
without
the
least
warning
and
would
catch
up
to
be
with
him
in
everlasting
glory
all
whom
acceptance
of
the
atonement
had
sealed
for
immortality
these
were
on
the
whole
not
numerous
and
our
belief
was
that
the
world
after
a
few
days
amazement
at
the
total
disappearance
of
these
persons
would
revert
to
its
customary
habits
of
life
merely
sinking
more
rapidly
into
a
moral
corruption
due
to
the
removal
of
these
souls
of
salt
this
event
an
examination
of
prophecy
had
led
my
father
to
regard
as
absolutely
imminent
and
sometimes
when
we
parted
for
the
night
he
would
say
with
a
sparkling
rapture
in
his
eyes
knows
we
may
meet
next
in
the
air
with
all
the
cohorts
of
god
saints
this
conviction
i
shared
without
a
doubt
and
indeed
in
perfect
innocency
i
hope
but
perhaps
with
a
touch
of
slyness
too
i
proposed
at
the
end
of
the
summer
holidays
that
i
should
stay
at
home
is
the
use
of
my
going
to
school
let
me
be
with
you
when
we
rise
to
meet
the
lord
in
the
air
to
this
my
father
sharply
and
firmly
replied
that
it
was
our
duty
to
carry
on
our
usual
avocations
to
the
last
for
we
knew
not
the
moment
of
his
coming
and
we
should
be
together
in
an
instant
on
that
day
how
far
soever
we
might
be
parted
upon
earth
i
was
ashamed
but
his
argument
was
logical
and
as
it
proved
judicious
my
father
lived
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
more
never
losing
the
hope
of
tasting
death
and
as
the
last
moments
of
mortality
approached
he
was
bitterly
disappointed
at
what
he
held
to
be
a
scanty
reward
of
his
long
faith
and
patience
but
if
my
own
life
work
had
been
as
i
proposed
shelved
in
expectation
of
the
lord
imminent
advent
i
should
have
cumbered
the
ground
until
this
day
to
school
therefore
i
returned
with
a
brain
full
of
strange
discords
in
a
huddled
mixture
of
and
the
book
of
revelation
john
wesley
hymns
and
night
dream
few
boys
of
my
age
i
suppose
carried
about
with
them
such
a
confused
throng
of
immature
impressions
and
contradictory
hopes
i
was
at
one
moment
devoutly
pious
at
the
next
haunted
by
visions
of
material
beauty
and
longing
for
sensuous
impressions
in
my
hot
and
silly
brain
jesus
and
pan
held
sway
together
as
in
a
wayside
chapel
discordantly
and
impishly
consecrated
to
pagan
and
to
christian
rites
but
for
the
present
as
in
the
great
chorus
which
so
marvellously
portrays
our
double
nature
of
bethlehem
was
still
dominant
i
became
more
and
more
pietistic
beginning
now
to
versify
i
wrote
a
tragedy
in
pale
imitation
of
shakespeare
but
on
a
biblical
and
evangelistic
subject
and
odes
that
were
parodies
of
those
in
unbound
but
dealt
with
the
approaching
advent
of
our
lord
and
the
rapture
of
his
saints
my
unwholesome
excitement
bubbling
up
in
this
violent
way
reached
at
last
a
climax
and
foamed
over
it
was
a
summer
afternoon
and
being
now
left
very
free
in
my
movements
i
had
escaped
from
going
out
with
the
rest
of
my
schoolfellows
in
their
formal
walk
in
charge
of
an
usher
i
had
been
reading
a
good
deal
of
poetry
but
my
heart
had
translated
apollo
and
bacchus
into
terms
of
exalted
christian
faith
i
was
alone
and
i
lay
on
a
sofa
drawn
across
a
large
open
window
at
the
top
of
the
in
a
room
which
was
used
as
a
study
by
the
boys
who
were
up
for
examination
i
gazed
down
on
a
labyrinth
of
garden
sloping
to
the
sea
which
twinkled
faintly
beyond
the
towers
of
the
town
each
of
these
gardens
held
a
villa
in
it
but
all
the
near
landscape
below
me
was
drowned
in
foliage
a
wonderful
warm
light
of
approaching
sunset
modelled
the
shadows
and
set
the
broad
summits
of
the
trees
in
a
rich
glow
there
was
an
absolute
silence
below
and
around
me
a
magic
of
suspense
seemed
to
keep
every
topmost
twig
from
waving
over
my
soul
there
swept
an
immense
wave
of
emotion
now
surely
now
the
great
final
change
must
be
approaching
i
gazed
up
into
the
sky
and
i
broke
irresistibly
into
speech
now
lord
jesus
i
cried
now
and
take
me
to
be
for
ever
with
thee
in
thy
paradise
i
am
ready
to
come
my
heart
is
purged
from
sin
there
is
nothing
that
keeps
me
rooted
to
this
wicked
world
oh
come
now
now
and
take
me
before
i
have
known
the
temptations
of
life
before
i
have
to
go
to
london
and
all
the
dreadful
things
that
happen
there
and
i
raised
myself
on
the
sofa
and
leaned
upon
the
and
waited
for
the
glorious
apparition
this
was
the
highest
moment
of
my
religious
life
the
apex
of
my
striving
after
holiness
i
waited
awhile
watching
and
then
i
felt
a
faint
shame
at
the
theatrical
attitude
i
had
adopted
although
i
was
alone
still
i
gazed
and
still
i
hoped
then
a
little
breeze
sprang
up
and
the
branches
danced
sounds
began
to
rise
from
the
road
beneath
me
presently
the
colour
deepened
the
evening
came
on
from
far
below
there
rose
to
me
the
chatter
of
the
boys
returning
home
the
rang
last
word
of
prose
to
shatter
my
mystical
poetry
lord
has
not
come
the
lord
will
never
come
i
muttered
and
in
my
heart
the
artificial
edifice
of
extravagant
faith
began
to
totter
and
crumble
from
that
moment
forth
my
father
and
i
though
the
fact
was
long
successfully
concealed
from
him
and
even
from
myself
walked
in
opposite
hemispheres
of
the
soul
with
thick
o
the
world
between
us
epilogue
this
narrative
however
must
not
be
allowed
to
close
with
the
son
in
the
foreground
of
the
piece
if
it
has
a
value
that
value
consists
in
what
light
it
may
contrive
to
throw
upon
the
unique
and
noble
figure
of
the
father
with
the
advance
of
years
the
characteristics
of
this
figure
became
more
severely
outlined
more
rigorously
confined
within
settled
limits
in
relation
to
the
son
who
presently
departed
at
a
very
immature
age
for
the
new
life
in
london
the
attitude
of
the
father
continued
to
be
one
of
extreme
solicitude
deepening
by
degrees
into
disappointment
and
disenchantment
he
abated
no
jot
or
tittle
of
his
demands
upon
human
frailty
he
kept
the
spiritual
cord
drawn
tight
the
biblical
was
incessantly
busy
jerking
into
position
the
head
of
the
dejected
neophyte
that
young
soul
removed
from
the
father
personal
inspection
began
to
blossom
forth
crudely
and
irregularly
enough
into
new
provinces
of
thought
through
fresh
layers
of
experience
to
the
painful
mentor
at
home
in
the
west
the
centre
of
anxiety
was
still
the
meek
and
docile
heart
dedicated
to
the
lord
service
which
must
at
all
hazards
and
with
all
defiance
of
the
rules
of
life
be
kept
unspotted
from
the
world
the
torment
of
a
postal
inquisition
began
directly
i
was
settled
in
my
london
lodgings
to
my
father
with
his
ample
leisure
his
palpitating
apprehension
his
ready
pen
the
flow
of
correspondence
offered
no
trouble
at
all
it
was
a
grave
but
gratifying
occupation
to
me
the
almost
daily
letter
of
exhortation
with
its
string
of
questions
about
conduct
its
series
of
warnings
grew
to
be
a
burden
which
could
hardly
be
borne
particularly
because
it
involved
a
reply
as
punctual
and
if
possible
as
full
as
itself
at
the
age
of
seventeen
the
metaphysics
of
the
soul
are
shadowy
and
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
be
forced
to
define
the
exact
outline
of
what
is
so
undulating
and
so
shapeless
to
my
father
there
seemed
no
reason
why
i
should
hesitate
to
give
answers
of
full
metallic
ring
to
his
hard
and
questions
but
to
me
this
correspondence
was
torture
when
i
feebly
expostulated
when
i
begged
to
be
left
a
little
to
myself
these
appeals
of
mine
automatically
stimulated
and
indeed
blew
up
into
fierce
flames
the
ardour
of
my
alarm
the
letter
the
only
expected
letter
would
lie
on
the
table
as
i
descended
to
breakfast
it
would
commonly
be
of
course
my
only
letter
unless
tempered
by
a
cosy
and
chatty
note
from
my
dear
and
comfortable
stepmother
dealing
with
such
perfectly
tranquillizing
subjects
as
the
harvest
of
roses
in
the
garden
or
the
state
of
health
of
various
neighbours
but
the
other
the
solitary
letter
in
its
threatening
whiteness
with
its
exquisitely
penned
address
there
it
would
lie
awaiting
me
destroying
the
taste
of
the
bacon
reducing
the
flavour
of
the
tea
to
insipidity
i
might
fatuously
dally
with
it
i
might
pretend
not
to
observe
it
but
there
it
lay
before
the
exercise
began
i
knew
that
it
had
to
be
read
and
what
was
worse
that
it
had
to
be
answered
useless
the
effort
to
conceal
from
myself
what
it
contained
like
all
its
precursors
like
all
its
followers
it
would
insist
with
every
variety
of
appeal
on
a
reiterated
declaration
that
i
still
fully
intended
as
in
the
days
of
my
earliest
childhood
be
on
the
lord
side
in
everything
in
my
replies
i
would
sometimes
answer
precisely
as
i
was
desired
to
answer
sometimes
i
would
evade
the
queries
and
write
about
other
things
sometimes
i
would
turn
upon
the
tormentor
and
urge
that
my
tender
youth
might
be
let
alone
it
little
mattered
what
form
of
weakness
i
put
forth
by
way
of
baffling
my
father
direct
firm
unflinching
strength
to
an
appeal
against
the
bondage
of
a
correspondence
of
such
unbroken
solemnity
i
would
receive
with
what
a
paralysing
promptitude
such
a
reply
as
this
me
say
that
the
you
complain
of
has
only
been
the
expression
of
tender
anxiousness
of
a
father
heart
that
his
only
child
just
turned
out
upon
the
world
and
very
far
out
of
his
sight
and
hearing
should
be
walking
in
god
way
recollect
that
it
is
not
now
as
it
was
when
you
were
at
school
when
we
had
personal
communication
with
you
at
intervals
of
five
days
we
now
know
absolutely
nothing
of
you
save
from
your
letters
and
if
they
do
not
indicate
your
spiritual
prosperity
the
deepest
solicitudes
of
our
hearts
have
nothing
to
feed
on
but
i
will
try
henceforth
to
trust
you
and
lay
aside
my
fears
for
you
are
worthy
of
my
confidence
and
your
own
god
and
your
father
god
will
hold
you
with
his
right
hand
over
such
letters
as
these
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
sometimes
wept
the
old
paper
i
have
just
been
copying
shows
traces
of
tears
shed
upon
it
more
than
forty
years
ago
tears
commingled
of
despair
at
my
own
feebleness
distraction
at
my
want
of
will
pity
for
my
father
manifest
and
pathetic
distress
he
would
henceforth
to
trust
me
he
said
alas
the
effort
would
be
in
vain
after
a
day
or
two
after
a
hollow
attempt
to
write
of
other
things
the
importunate
subject
would
recur
there
would
intrude
again
the
inevitable
questions
about
the
atonement
and
the
means
of
grace
the
old
anxious
fears
lest
i
was
my
intimacy
to
agreeable
companions
who
were
not
with
me
in
christ
fresh
passionate
entreaties
to
be
assured
in
every
letter
that
i
was
walking
in
the
clear
light
of
god
presence
it
seems
to
me
now
profoundly
strange
although
i
knew
too
little
of
the
world
to
remark
it
at
the
time
that
these
incessant
exhortations
dealt
not
with
conduct
but
with
faith
earlier
in
this
narrative
i
have
noted
how
disdainfully
with
what
an
austere
pride
my
father
refused
to
entertain
the
subject
of
personal
shortcomings
in
my
behaviour
there
were
enough
of
them
to
blame
heaven
knows
but
he
was
too
a
gentleman
to
dwell
upon
them
and
though
by
nature
deeply
suspicious
of
the
possibility
of
frequent
moral
lapses
even
in
the
very
elect
he
refused
to
stoop
to
anything
like
espionage
i
owe
him
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
for
his
beautiful
faith
in
me
in
this
respect
and
now
that
i
was
alone
in
london
at
this
tender
time
of
life
as
they
say
to
all
sorts
of
dangers
as
defenceless
as
a
fledgling
that
has
been
turned
out
of
its
nest
yet
my
father
did
not
in
his
uplifted
quixotism
allow
himself
to
fancy
me
guilty
of
any
moral
misbehaviour
but
concentrated
his
fears
entirely
upon
my
faith
me
know
more
of
your
inner
light
does
the
candle
of
the
lord
shine
on
your
soul
this
would
be
the
ceaseless
inquiry
or
again
you
get
any
spiritual
companionship
with
young
men
you
passed
over
last
sunday
without
even
a
word
yet
this
day
is
the
most
interesting
to
me
in
your
whole
week
do
you
find
the
ministry
of
the
word
pleasant
and
above
all
profitable
does
it
bring
your
soul
into
exercise
before
god
the
coming
of
christ
draweth
nigh
watch
therefore
and
pray
always
that
you
may
be
counted
worthy
to
stand
before
the
son
of
man
if
i
quote
such
passages
as
this
from
my
father
letters
to
me
it
is
not
that
i
seek
entertainment
in
a
contrast
between
his
earnestness
and
the
casuistical
inattention
and
provoked
distractedness
of
a
young
man
to
whom
the
real
world
now
offered
its
irritating
and
stimulating
scenes
of
animal
and
intellectual
life
but
to
call
out
sympathy
and
perhaps
wonder
at
the
spectacle
of
so
blind
a
roman
firmness
as
my
father
spiritual
attitude
displayed
his
aspirations
were
individual
and
metaphysical
at
the
present
hour
so
complete
is
the
revolution
which
has
overturned
the
puritanism
of
which
he
was
perhaps
the
latest
surviving
type
that
all
classes
of
religious
persons
combine
in
placing
philanthropic
activity
the
objective
attitude
in
the
foreground
it
is
extraordinary
how
the
change
has
been
so
that
nowadays
a
religion
which
does
not
combine
with
its
subjective
faith
a
strenuous
labour
for
the
good
of
others
is
hardly
held
to
possess
any
religious
principle
worth
proclaiming
this
propaganda
of
beneficence
this
constant
attention
to
the
moral
and
physical
improvement
of
persons
who
have
been
neglected
is
quite
recent
as
a
leading
feature
of
religion
though
indeed
it
seems
to
have
formed
some
part
of
the
original
design
it
was
unknown
to
the
great
preachers
of
the
seventeenth
century
whether
catholic
or
protestant
and
it
offered
but
a
shadowy
attraction
to
my
father
who
was
the
last
of
their
disciples
when
bossuet
desired
his
hearers
to
listen
to
the
de
misere
de
nous
qui
devrait
nous
fondre
le
he
started
a
new
thing
in
the
world
of
theology
we
may
search
the
famous
and
exercises
of
holy
living
from
cover
to
cover
and
not
learn
that
jeremy
taylor
would
have
thought
that
any
activity
of
the
or
the
salvation
lassie
came
within
the
category
of
saintliness
my
father
then
like
an
old
divine
concentrated
on
thoughts
upon
the
intellectual
part
of
faith
in
his
obsession
about
me
he
believed
that
if
my
brain
could
be
kept
unaffected
by
any
of
the
seductive
errors
of
the
age
and
my
heart
centred
in
the
adoring
love
of
god
all
would
be
well
with
me
in
perpetuity
he
was
still
convinced
that
by
intensely
directing
my
thoughts
he
could
compel
them
to
flow
in
a
certain
channel
since
he
had
not
begun
to
learn
the
lesson
so
mournful
for
saintly
men
of
his
complexion
that
would
not
be
virtue
could
it
be
given
by
one
fellow
creature
to
another
he
had
recognized
with
reluctance
that
holiness
was
not
hereditary
but
he
continued
to
hope
that
it
might
be
compulsive
i
was
still
child
of
many
prayers
and
it
was
not
to
be
conceded
that
these
prayers
could
remain
unanswered
the
great
panacea
was
now
as
always
the
study
of
the
bible
and
this
my
father
never
ceased
to
urge
upon
me
he
presented
to
me
a
copy
of
dean
alford
edition
of
the
greek
new
testament
in
four
great
volumes
and
these
he
had
had
so
magnificently
bound
in
full
morocco
that
the
work
shone
on
my
poor
shelf
of
sixpenny
poets
like
a
duchess
among
dairy
maids
he
extracted
from
me
a
written
promise
that
i
would
translate
and
meditate
upon
a
portion
of
the
greek
text
every
morning
before
i
started
for
business
this
promise
i
presently
failed
to
keep
my
good
intentions
being
undermined
by
an
invincible
i
concealed
the
dereliction
from
him
and
the
sense
that
i
was
deceiving
my
father
ate
into
my
conscience
like
a
canker
but
the
dilemma
was
now
before
me
that
i
must
either
deceive
my
father
in
such
things
or
paralyse
my
own
character
my
growing
distaste
for
the
holy
scriptures
began
to
occupy
my
thoughts
and
to
surprise
as
much
as
it
scandalized
me
my
desire
was
to
continue
to
delight
in
those
sacred
pages
for
which
i
still
had
an
instinctive
veneration
yet
i
could
not
but
observe
the
difference
between
the
zeal
with
which
i
snatched
at
a
volume
of
carlyle
or
ruskin
since
these
magicians
were
now
first
revealing
themselves
to
me
and
the
increasing
languor
with
which
i
took
up
alford
for
my
daily
of
course
although
i
did
not
know
it
and
believed
my
reluctance
to
be
sinful
the
real
reason
why
i
now
found
the
bible
so
difficult
to
read
was
my
familiarity
with
its
contents
these
had
the
colourless
triteness
of
a
story
retold
a
hundred
times
i
longed
for
something
new
something
that
would
gratify
curiosity
and
excite
surprise
whether
the
facts
and
doctrines
contained
in
the
bible
were
true
or
false
was
not
the
question
that
appealed
to
me
it
was
rather
that
they
had
been
presented
to
me
so
often
and
had
sunken
into
me
so
far
that
as
someone
has
said
they
bedridden
in
the
dormitory
of
the
soul
and
made
no
impression
of
any
kind
upon
me
it
often
amazed
me
and
i
am
still
unable
to
understand
the
fact
that
my
father
through
his
long
life
or
until
nearly
the
close
of
it
continued
to
take
an
eager
pleasure
in
the
text
of
the
bible
as
i
think
i
have
already
said
before
he
reached
middle
life
he
had
committed
practically
the
whole
of
it
to
memory
and
if
started
anywhere
even
in
a
minor
prophet
he
could
go
on
without
a
break
as
long
as
ever
he
was
inclined
for
that
exercise
he
therefore
at
no
time
can
have
been
assailed
by
the
satiety
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
that
it
came
so
soon
to
me
i
must
take
simply
as
an
indication
of
difference
of
temperament
it
was
not
possible
even
through
the
dark
glass
of
correspondence
to
deceive
his
eagle
eye
in
this
matter
and
his
suspicions
accordingly
took
another
turn
he
conceived
me
to
have
become
or
to
be
becoming
a
victim
of
infidelity
of
the
age
in
this
new
difficulty
he
appealed
to
forms
of
modern
literature
by
the
side
of
which
the
least
attractive
pages
of
leviticus
or
deuteronomy
struck
me
as
even
thrilling
in
particular
he
urged
upon
me
a
work
then
just
published
called
continuity
of
by
william
page
wood
afterwards
lord
chancellor
hatherley
i
do
not
know
why
he
supposed
that
the
lucubrations
of
an
exemplary
lawyer
delivered
in
a
style
that
was
like
the
trickling
of
sawdust
would
succeed
in
rousing
emotions
which
the
glorious
rhetoric
of
the
orient
had
failed
to
awaken
but
page
wood
had
been
a
sunday
school
teacher
for
thirty
years
and
my
father
was
always
unduly
impressed
by
the
acumen
of
pious
barristers
as
time
went
on
and
i
grew
older
and
more
independent
in
mind
my
father
anxiety
about
what
he
called
pitfalls
and
snares
which
surround
on
every
hand
the
thoughtless
giddy
youth
of
london
became
extremely
painful
to
himself
by
harping
in
private
upon
these
which
brought
to
my
imagination
a
funny
rough
woodcut
in
an
old
edition
of
bunyan
where
a
devil
was
seen
capering
over
a
sort
of
box
let
neatly
into
the
ground
he
worked
himself
up
into
a
frame
of
mind
which
was
not
a
little
irritating
to
his
hapless
correspondent
who
was
now
indeed
limed
by
the
pen
like
a
bird
by
the
feet
and
could
not
by
any
means
escape
to
a
peck
or
a
flutter
from
the
bird
the
implacable
fowler
would
reply
charge
me
with
being
suspicious
and
i
fear
i
can
not
deny
the
charge
but
i
can
appeal
to
your
own
sensitive
and
thoughtful
mind
for
a
considerable
allowance
my
deep
and
tender
love
for
you
your
youth
and
inexperience
the
examples
of
other
young
men
your
distance
from
parental
counsel
our
absolute
and
painful
ignorance
of
all
the
details
of
your
daily
life
except
what
you
yourself
tell
us
try
to
throw
yourself
into
the
standing
of
a
parent
and
say
if
my
suspiciousness
is
unreasonable
i
rejoicingly
acknowledge
that
from
all
i
see
you
are
pursuing
a
virtuous
steady
worthy
course
one
good
thing
my
suspiciousness
does
ever
and
anon
it
brings
out
from
you
assurances
which
greatly
refresh
and
comfort
me
and
again
it
carries
me
ever
to
god
throne
of
grace
on
your
behalf
holy
job
suspected
that
his
sons
might
have
sinned
and
cursed
god
in
their
heart
was
not
his
suspicion
much
like
mine
grounded
on
the
same
reasons
and
productive
of
the
same
results
for
it
drove
him
to
god
in
intercession
i
have
adduced
the
example
of
this
patriarch
before
and
he
will
endure
being
looked
at
again
in
fact
holy
job
continued
to
be
frequently
looked
at
and
for
this
patriarch
i
came
to
experience
a
hatred
which
was
as
venomous
as
it
was
undeserved
but
what
youth
of
eighteen
would
willingly
be
compared
with
the
sons
of
job
and
indeed
for
my
part
i
felt
much
more
like
that
justly
exasperated
character
elihu
the
buzite
of
the
kindred
of
ram
as
time
went
on
the
peculiar
strain
of
inquisition
was
relaxed
and
i
endured
fewer
and
fewer
of
the
torments
of
religious
correspondence
nothing
abides
in
one
tense
projection
and
my
father
resolute
as
he
was
had
other
preoccupations
his
orchids
his
microscope
his
physiological
researches
his
interpretations
of
prophecy
filled
up
the
hours
of
his
active
and
strenuous
life
and
out
of
his
sight
i
became
not
indeed
out
of
his
mind
but
no
longer
ceaselessly
in
the
painful
foreground
of
it
yet
although
the
reiteration
of
his
anxiety
might
weary
him
a
little
as
it
had
wearied
me
well
nigh
to
groans
of
despair
there
was
not
the
slightest
change
in
his
real
attitude
towards
the
subject
or
towards
me
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
say
that
he
had
nothing
of
the
mystic
or
the
visionary
about
him
at
certain
times
and
on
certain
points
he
greatly
desired
that
signs
and
wonders
such
as
had
astonished
and
encouraged
the
infancy
of
the
christian
church
might
again
be
vouchsafed
to
it
but
he
did
not
pretend
to
see
such
miracles
himself
nor
give
the
slightest
credence
to
others
who
asserted
that
they
did
he
often
congratulated
himself
on
the
fact
that
although
his
mind
dwelt
so
constantly
on
spiritual
matters
it
was
never
betrayed
into
any
suspension
of
the
rational
functions
by
letter
slackened
but
on
occasion
of
my
brief
and
usually
summer
visits
to
devonshire
i
suffered
acutely
from
my
father
dialectical
appetites
he
was
surrounded
by
peasants
on
whom
the
teeth
of
his
arguments
could
find
no
purchase
to
him
in
that
intellectual
abdera
even
an
unwilling
youth
from
london
offered
opportunities
of
pleasant
contest
he
would
declare
himself
ready
nay
eager
for
argument
with
his
mental
sleeves
turned
up
he
would
adopt
a
fighting
attitude
and
challenge
me
to
a
round
on
any
portion
of
the
scheme
of
grace
his
alacrity
was
dreadful
to
me
his
blows
fell
on
what
was
rather
a
bladder
or
a
pillow
than
a
vivid
antagonist
he
was
indeed
most
unfairly
handicapped
i
was
naked
he
in
a
suit
of
chain
armour
for
he
had
adopted
a
method
which
i
thought
and
must
still
think
exceedingly
unfair
he
assumed
that
he
had
private
knowledge
of
the
divine
will
and
he
would
meet
my
temporizing
arguments
by
asseverations
sure
as
my
god
liveth
or
by
appeals
to
a
higher
authority
what
does
lord
tell
me
in
paul
letter
to
the
philippians
it
was
the
prerogative
of
his
faith
to
know
and
of
his
character
to
overpower
objection
between
these
two
millstones
i
was
rapidly
ground
to
powder
these
as
they
were
rather
ironically
called
invariably
ended
for
me
in
disaster
i
was
driven
out
of
my
fastnesses
my
canvas
walls
rocked
at
the
first
peal
from
my
father
clarion
and
the
foe
pursued
me
across
the
plains
of
jericho
until
i
lay
down
ignominiously
and
covered
my
face
i
seemed
to
be
pushed
with
horns
of
iron
such
as
those
which
zedekiah
the
son
of
chenaanah
prepared
for
the
encouragement
of
ahab
when
i
acknowledged
defeat
and
cried
for
quarter
my
father
would
become
radiant
and
i
still
seem
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
full
voice
so
thrilling
so
warm
so
painful
to
my
nerves
bursting
forth
in
a
sort
of
benediction
at
the
end
of
each
of
these
contentions
with
bow
my
knees
unto
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
he
would
grant
you
according
to
the
riches
of
his
glory
to
be
strengthened
with
might
by
his
spirit
in
the
inner
man
that
christ
may
dwell
in
your
heart
by
faith
that
you
being
rooted
and
grounded
in
love
may
be
able
to
comprehend
with
all
saints
what
is
the
breadth
and
length
and
depth
and
height
and
to
know
the
love
of
christ
which
passeth
knowledge
that
you
might
be
filled
with
the
fullness
of
god
thus
solemn
and
thus
ceremonious
was
my
father
apt
to
become
without
a
moment
warning
on
plain
and
domestic
occasions
abruptly
brimming
over
with
emotion
like
a
basin
which
an
unseen
flow
of
water
has
filled
and
i
earnestly
desire
that
no
trace
of
that
absurd
which
is
apt
to
taint
recollections
of
this
nature
should
give
falsity
to
mine
my
father
let
me
say
once
more
had
other
interests
than
those
of
his
religion
in
particular
at
this
time
he
took
to
painting
in
in
the
open
air
and
he
resumed
the
assiduous
study
of
botany
he
was
no
fanatical
monomaniac
nevertheless
there
was
in
everything
he
did
and
said
the
central
purpose
present
he
acknowledged
it
plainly
me
he
confessed
question
assumes
a
divine
standpoint
and
is
not
adequately
answered
if
the
of
christ
is
not
kept
in
sight
this
was
maintained
whether
the
subject
under
discussion
was
poetry
or
society
or
the
prussian
war
with
austria
or
the
stamen
of
a
wild
flower
once
at
least
he
was
himself
conscious
of
the
fatiguing
effect
on
my
temper
of
this
insistency
for
raising
his
great
brown
eyes
with
a
flash
of
laughter
in
them
he
closed
the
bible
suddenly
after
a
very
lengthy
disquisition
and
quoted
his
virgil
to
startling
effect
claudite
jam
rivos
pueri
sat
prata
biberunt
the
insistency
of
his
religious
conversation
was
probably
the
less
incomprehensible
to
me
on
account
of
the
evangelical
training
to
which
i
had
been
so
systematically
subjected
it
was
however
none
the
less
intolerably
irksome
and
would
have
been
exasperating
i
believe
even
to
a
nature
in
which
a
powerful
and
genuine
piety
was
inherent
to
my
own
in
which
a
feeble
and
imitative
faith
was
expiring
it
was
deeply
vexatious
it
led
alas
to
a
great
deal
of
bowing
in
the
house
of
rimmon
to
much
hypocritical
ingenuity
in
drawing
my
father
attention
away
if
possible
as
the
terrible
subject
was
seen
to
be
looming
and
approaching
in
this
my
stepmother
would
aid
and
abet
sometimes
producing
incongruous
themes
likely
to
attract
my
father
aside
with
a
skill
worthy
of
a
parlour
conjurer
and
much
to
my
admiration
if
however
she
was
not
unwilling
to
come
in
this
way
to
the
support
of
my
feebleness
there
was
no
open
collusion
between
us
she
always
described
my
father
when
she
was
alone
with
me
admiringly
as
one
trumpet
gave
no
uncertain
sound
there
was
not
a
tinge
of
infidelity
upon
her
candid
mind
but
she
was
human
and
i
think
that
now
and
then
she
was
extremely
bored
my
father
was
entirely
devoid
of
the
prudence
which
turns
away
its
eyes
and
passes
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
the
opposite
direction
the
peculiar
kind
of
drama
in
which
every
sort
of
social
discomfort
is
welcomed
rather
than
that
the
characters
should
be
happy
when
guilty
of
a
lie
was
not
invented
in
those
days
and
there
can
hardly
be
imagined
a
figure
more
remote
from
my
father
than
ibsen
yet
when
i
came
at
a
far
later
date
to
read
wild
memories
of
the
embarrassing
household
of
my
infancy
helped
me
to
realize
gregers
werle
with
his
determination
to
pull
the
veil
of
illusion
away
from
every
compromise
that
makes
life
bearable
i
was
docile
i
was
plausible
i
was
anything
but
combative
if
my
father
could
have
persuaded
himself
to
let
me
alone
if
he
could
merely
have
been
willing
to
leave
my
subterfuges
and
my
explanations
unanalysed
all
would
have
been
well
but
he
refused
to
see
any
difference
in
temperament
between
a
lad
of
twenty
and
a
sage
of
sixty
he
had
no
vital
sympathy
for
youth
which
in
itself
had
no
charm
for
him
he
had
no
compassion
for
the
weaknesses
of
immaturity
and
his
one
and
only
anxiety
was
to
be
at
the
end
of
his
spiritual
journey
safe
with
me
in
the
house
where
there
are
many
mansions
the
incidents
of
human
life
upon
the
road
to
glory
were
less
than
nothing
to
him
my
father
was
very
fond
of
defining
what
was
his
own
attitude
at
this
time
and
he
was
never
tired
of
urging
the
same
ambition
upon
me
he
regarded
himself
as
the
faithful
steward
of
a
master
who
might
return
at
any
moment
and
who
would
require
to
find
everything
ready
for
his
convenience
that
master
was
god
with
whom
my
father
seriously
believed
himself
to
be
in
relations
much
more
confidential
than
those
vouchsafed
to
ordinary
pious
persons
he
awaited
with
anxious
hope
coming
of
the
lord
an
event
which
he
still
frequently
believed
to
be
imminent
he
would
calculate
by
reference
to
prophecies
in
the
old
and
new
testament
the
exact
date
of
this
event
the
date
would
pass
without
the
expected
advent
and
he
would
be
more
than
disappointed
he
would
be
incensed
then
he
would
understand
that
he
must
have
made
some
slight
error
in
calculation
and
the
pleasures
of
anticipation
would
recommence
me
in
all
this
he
used
as
a
kind
of
inferior
coadjutor
much
as
a
responsible
and
upper
servant
might
use
a
footboy
i
also
must
be
watching
it
was
not
important
that
i
should
be
seriously
engaged
in
any
affairs
of
my
own
i
must
be
ready
for
the
master
coming
and
my
father
incessant
was
made
in
the
spirit
of
a
responsible
servant
who
fidgets
lest
some
humble
but
essential
piece
of
household
work
has
been
neglected
my
holidays
however
and
all
my
personal
relations
with
my
father
were
poisoned
by
this
insistency
i
was
never
at
my
ease
in
his
company
i
never
knew
when
i
might
not
be
subjected
to
a
series
of
searching
questions
which
i
should
not
be
allowed
to
evade
meanwhile
on
every
other
stage
of
experience
i
was
gaining
the
reliance
upon
self
and
the
respect
for
the
opinion
of
others
which
come
naturally
to
a
young
man
of
sober
habits
who
earns
his
own
living
and
lives
his
own
life
for
this
kind
of
independence
my
father
had
no
respect
or
consideration
when
questions
of
religion
were
introduced
although
he
handsomely
conceded
it
on
other
points
and
now
first
there
occurred
to
me
the
reflection
which
in
years
to
come
i
was
to
repeat
over
and
over
with
an
ever
sadder
emphasis
what
a
charming
companion
what
a
delightful
parent
what
a
courteous
and
engaging
friend
my
father
would
have
been
and
would
have
been
to
me
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
stringent
piety
which
ruined
it
all
let
me
speak
plainly
after
my
long
experience
after
my
patience
and
forbearance
i
have
surely
the
right
to
protest
against
the
untruth
would
that
i
could
apply
to
it
any
other
word
that
evangelical
religion
or
any
religion
in
a
violent
form
is
a
wholesome
or
valuable
or
desirable
adjunct
to
human
life
it
divides
heart
from
heart
it
sets
up
a
vain
chimerical
ideal
in
the
barren
pursuit
of
which
all
the
tender
indulgent
affections
all
the
genial
play
of
life
all
the
exquisite
pleasures
and
soft
resignations
of
the
body
all
that
enlarges
and
calms
the
soul
are
exchanged
for
what
is
harsh
and
void
and
negative
it
encourages
a
stern
and
ignorant
spirit
of
condemnation
it
throws
altogether
out
of
gear
the
healthy
movement
of
the
conscience
it
invents
virtues
which
are
sterile
and
cruel
it
invents
sins
which
are
no
sins
at
all
but
which
darken
the
heaven
of
innocent
joy
with
futile
clouds
of
remorse
there
is
something
horrible
if
we
will
bring
ourselves
to
face
it
in
the
fanaticism
that
can
do
nothing
with
this
pathetic
and
fugitive
existence
of
ours
but
treat
it
as
if
it
were
the
uncomfortable
to
a
palace
which
no
one
has
explored
and
of
the
plan
of
which
we
know
absolutely
nothing
my
father
it
is
true
believed
that
he
was
intimately
acquainted
with
the
form
and
furniture
of
this
habitation
and
he
wished
me
to
think
of
nothing
else
but
of
the
advantages
of
an
eternal
residence
in
it
then
came
a
moment
when
my
revolted
against
the
to
which
my
were
incessantly
subjected
there
was
a
morning
in
the
at
home
among
the
gorgeous
waxen
orchids
which
reminded
my
father
of
the
tropics
in
his
youth
when
my
forbearance
or
my
timidity
gave
way
the
enervated
air
soaked
with
the
intoxicating
perfumes
of
all
those
voluptuous
flowers
may
have
been
partly
responsible
for
my
outburst
my
father
had
once
more
put
to
me
the
customary
interrogatory
was
i
closely
with
god
was
my
sense
of
the
efficacy
of
the
atonement
clear
and
sound
had
the
holy
scriptures
still
their
full
authority
with
me
my
replies
on
this
occasion
were
violent
and
hysterical
i
have
no
clear
recollection
what
it
was
that
i
said
i
desire
not
to
recall
the
whimpering
sentences
in
which
i
begged
to
be
let
alone
in
which
i
demanded
the
right
to
think
for
myself
in
which
i
repudiated
the
idea
that
my
father
was
responsible
to
god
for
my
secret
thoughts
and
my
most
intimate
convictions
he
made
no
answer
i
broke
from
the
odorous
furnace
of
the
conservatory
and
buried
my
face
in
the
cold
grass
upon
the
lawn
my
visit
to
devonshire
already
near
its
close
was
hurried
to
an
end
i
had
scarcely
arrived
in
london
before
the
following
letter
furiously
despatched
in
the
track
of
the
fugitive
buried
itself
like
an
arrow
in
my
heart
your
sainted
mother
died
she
not
only
tenderly
committed
you
to
god
but
left
you
also
as
a
solemn
charge
to
me
to
bring
you
up
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lord
that
responsibility
i
have
sought
constantly
to
keep
before
me
i
can
truly
aver
that
it
has
been
ever
before
me
in
my
choice
of
a
housekeeper
in
my
choice
of
a
school
in
my
ordering
of
your
holidays
in
my
choice
of
a
second
wife
in
my
choice
of
an
occupation
for
you
in
my
choice
of
a
residence
for
you
and
in
multitudes
of
lesser
things
i
have
sought
to
act
for
you
not
in
the
light
of
this
present
world
but
with
a
view
to
eternity
your
childhood
was
past
there
seemed
god
manifest
blessing
on
our
care
for
you
seemed
truly
converted
to
him
you
confessed
in
solemn
baptism
that
you
had
died
and
had
been
raised
with
christ
and
you
were
received
with
joy
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
of
god
as
one
alive
from
the
dead
this
filled
my
heart
with
thankfulness
and
joy
whenever
i
thought
of
you
how
could
it
do
otherwise
and
when
i
left
you
in
london
on
that
dreary
winter
evening
my
heart
full
of
sorrowing
love
found
its
refuge
and
its
resource
in
this
thought
that
you
were
one
of
the
lambs
of
christ
flock
sealed
with
the
holy
spirit
as
his
renewed
in
heart
to
holiness
in
the
image
of
god
a
while
all
appeared
to
go
on
fairly
well
we
yearned
indeed
to
discover
more
of
heart
in
your
allusions
to
religious
matters
but
your
expressions
towards
us
were
filial
and
affectionate
your
conduct
so
far
as
we
could
see
was
moral
and
becoming
you
mingled
with
the
people
of
god
spoke
of
occasional
delight
and
profit
in
his
ordinances
and
employed
your
talents
in
service
to
him
of
late
and
specially
during
the
past
year
there
has
become
manifest
a
rapid
progress
towards
evil
i
must
beg
you
here
to
pause
and
again
to
look
to
god
for
grace
to
weigh
what
i
am
about
to
say
or
else
wrath
will
rise
you
came
to
us
in
the
summer
the
heavy
blow
fell
full
upon
me
and
i
discovered
how
very
far
you
had
departed
from
god
it
was
not
that
you
had
yielded
to
the
strong
tide
of
youthful
blood
and
had
fallen
a
victim
to
fleshly
lusts
in
that
case
however
sad
your
enlightened
conscience
would
have
spoken
loudly
and
you
would
have
found
your
way
back
to
the
blood
which
cleanseth
us
from
all
sin
to
humble
confession
and
abasement
to
forgiveness
and
to
recommunion
with
god
it
was
not
this
it
was
worse
it
was
that
horrid
insidious
infidelity
which
had
already
worked
in
your
mind
and
heart
with
terrible
energy
far
worse
i
say
because
this
was
sapping
the
very
foundations
of
faith
on
which
all
true
godliness
all
real
religion
must
rest
seemed
left
to
which
i
could
appeal
we
had
i
found
no
common
ground
the
holy
scriptures
had
no
longer
any
authority
you
had
taught
yourself
to
evade
their
inspiration
any
particular
oracle
of
god
which
pressed
you
you
could
easily
explain
away
even
the
very
character
of
god
you
weighed
in
your
balance
of
fallen
reason
and
fashioned
it
accordingly
you
were
thus
sailing
down
the
rapid
tide
of
time
towards
eternity
without
a
single
authoritative
guide
having
cast
your
chart
overboard
except
what
you
might
fashion
and
forge
on
your
own
anvil
except
what
you
might
in
fact
not
think
i
am
speaking
in
passion
and
using
unwarrantable
strength
of
words
if
the
written
word
is
not
absolutely
authoritative
what
do
we
know
of
god
what
more
than
we
can
infer
that
is
guess
as
the
thoughtful
heathens
guessed
plato
socrates
cicero
from
dim
and
mute
surrounding
phenomena
what
do
we
know
of
eternity
of
our
relations
to
god
especially
of
the
relations
of
a
sinner
to
god
what
of
reconciliation
what
of
the
capital
question
how
can
a
god
of
perfect
spotless
rectitude
deal
with
me
a
corrupt
sinner
who
have
trampled
on
those
of
his
laws
which
were
even
written
on
my
conscience
dreadful
conduct
of
yours
i
had
intended
after
much
prayer
to
pass
by
in
entire
silence
but
your
apparently
sincere
inquiries
after
the
cause
of
my
sorrow
have
led
me
to
go
to
the
root
of
the
matter
and
i
could
not
stop
short
of
the
development
contained
in
this
letter
it
is
with
pain
not
in
anger
that
i
send
it
hoping
that
you
may
be
induced
to
review
the
whole
course
of
which
this
is
only
a
stage
before
god
if
this
grace
were
granted
to
you
oh
how
joyfully
should
i
bury
all
the
past
and
again
have
sweet
and
tender
fellowship
with
my
beloved
son
as
of
old
the
reader
who
has
done
me
the
favour
to
follow
this
record
of
the
clash
of
two
temperaments
will
not
fail
to
perceive
the
crowning
importance
of
the
letter
from
which
i
have
just
made
a
long
quotation
it
sums
up
with
the
closest
logic
the
whole
history
of
the
situation
and
i
may
leave
it
to
form
the
epigraph
of
this
little
book
all
that
i
need
further
say
is
to
point
out
that
when
such
defiance
is
offered
to
the
intelligence
of
a
thoughtful
and
honest
young
man
with
the
normal
impulses
of
his
years
there
are
but
two
alternatives
either
he
must
cease
to
think
for
himself
or
his
individualism
must
be
instantly
confirmed
and
the
necessity
of
religious
independence
must
be
emphasized
no
compromise
it
is
seen
was
offered
no
proposal
of
a
truce
would
have
been
acceptable
it
was
a
case
of
or
nothing
and
thus
desperately
challenged
the
young
conscience
threw
off
once
for
all
the
yoke
of
his
and
as
respectfully
as
he
could
without
parade
or
remonstrance
he
took
a
human
being
privilege
to
fashion
his
inner
life
for
himself
