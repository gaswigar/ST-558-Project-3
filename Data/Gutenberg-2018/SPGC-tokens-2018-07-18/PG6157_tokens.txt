men
live
by
and
other
tales
by
leo
tolstoy
we
know
that
we
have
passed
out
of
death
into
life
because
we
love
the
brethren
he
that
loveth
not
abideth
in
death
epistle
john
iii
whoso
hath
the
world
goods
and
beholdeth
his
brother
in
need
and
shutteth
up
his
compassion
from
him
how
doth
the
love
of
god
abide
in
him
my
little
children
let
us
not
love
in
word
neither
with
the
tongue
but
in
deed
and
truth
iii
love
is
of
god
and
every
one
that
loveth
is
begotten
of
god
and
knoweth
god
he
that
loveth
not
knoweth
not
god
for
god
is
love
iv
no
man
hath
beheld
god
at
any
time
if
we
love
one
another
god
abideth
in
us
iv
god
is
love
and
he
that
abideth
in
love
abideth
in
god
and
god
abideth
in
him
iv
if
a
man
say
i
love
god
and
hateth
his
brother
he
is
a
liar
for
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
whom
he
hath
seen
how
can
he
love
god
whom
he
hath
not
seen
iv
what
men
live
by
a
shoemaker
named
simon
who
had
neither
house
nor
land
of
his
own
lived
with
his
wife
and
children
in
a
peasant
hut
and
earned
his
living
by
his
work
work
was
cheap
but
bread
was
dear
and
what
he
earned
he
spent
for
food
the
man
and
his
wife
had
but
one
sheepskin
coat
between
them
for
winter
wear
and
even
that
was
torn
to
tatters
and
this
was
the
second
year
he
had
been
wanting
to
buy
for
a
new
coat
before
winter
simon
saved
up
a
little
money
a
note
lay
hidden
in
his
wife
box
and
five
roubles
and
twenty
kopeks
were
owed
him
by
customers
in
the
village
so
one
morning
he
prepared
to
go
to
the
village
to
buy
the
he
put
on
over
his
shirt
his
wife
wadded
nankeen
jacket
and
over
that
he
put
his
own
cloth
coat
he
took
the
note
in
his
pocket
cut
himself
a
stick
to
serve
as
a
staff
and
started
off
after
breakfast
i
collect
the
five
roubles
that
are
due
to
me
thought
he
add
the
three
i
have
got
and
that
will
be
enough
to
buy
for
the
winter
coat
he
came
to
the
village
and
called
at
a
peasant
hut
but
the
man
was
not
at
home
the
peasant
wife
promised
that
the
money
should
be
paid
next
week
but
she
would
not
pay
it
herself
then
simon
called
on
another
peasant
but
this
one
swore
he
had
no
money
and
would
only
pay
twenty
kopeks
which
he
owed
for
a
pair
of
boots
simon
had
mended
simon
then
tried
to
buy
the
on
credit
but
the
dealer
would
not
trust
him
bring
your
money
said
he
then
you
may
have
your
pick
of
the
skins
we
know
what
is
like
so
all
the
business
the
shoemaker
did
was
to
get
the
twenty
kopeks
for
boots
he
had
mended
and
to
take
a
pair
of
felt
boots
a
peasant
gave
him
to
sole
with
leather
simon
felt
downhearted
he
spent
the
twenty
kopeks
on
vodka
and
started
homewards
without
having
bought
any
skins
in
the
morning
he
had
felt
the
frost
but
now
after
drinking
the
vodka
he
felt
warm
even
without
a
coat
he
trudged
along
striking
his
stick
on
the
frozen
earth
with
one
hand
swinging
the
felt
boots
with
the
other
and
talking
to
himself
i
i
quite
warm
said
he
though
i
have
no
coat
i
had
a
drop
and
it
runs
through
all
my
veins
i
need
no
i
go
along
and
do
worry
about
anything
that
the
sort
of
man
i
am
what
do
i
care
i
can
live
without
i
do
need
them
my
wife
will
fret
to
be
sure
and
true
enough
it
is
a
shame
one
works
all
day
long
and
then
does
not
get
paid
stop
a
bit
if
you
do
bring
that
money
along
sure
enough
i
skin
you
blessed
if
i
do
that
he
pays
twenty
kopeks
at
a
time
what
can
i
do
with
twenty
kopeks
drink
all
one
can
do
hard
up
he
says
he
is
so
he
may
be
but
what
about
me
you
have
a
house
and
cattle
and
everything
i
only
what
i
stand
up
in
you
have
corn
of
your
own
growing
i
have
to
buy
every
grain
do
what
i
will
i
must
spend
three
roubles
every
week
for
bread
alone
i
come
home
and
find
the
bread
all
used
up
and
i
have
to
fork
out
another
rouble
and
a
half
so
just
pay
up
what
you
owe
and
no
nonsense
about
it
by
this
time
he
had
nearly
reached
the
shrine
at
the
bend
of
the
road
looking
up
he
saw
something
whitish
behind
the
shrine
the
daylight
was
fading
and
the
shoemaker
peered
at
the
thing
without
being
able
to
make
out
what
it
was
there
was
no
white
stone
here
before
can
it
be
an
ox
it
not
like
an
ox
it
has
a
head
like
a
man
but
it
too
white
and
what
could
a
man
be
doing
there
he
came
closer
so
that
it
was
clearly
visible
to
his
surprise
it
really
was
a
man
alive
or
dead
sitting
naked
leaning
motionless
against
the
shrine
terror
seized
the
shoemaker
and
he
thought
some
one
has
killed
him
stripped
him
and
left
him
there
if
i
meddle
i
shall
surely
get
into
trouble
so
the
shoemaker
went
on
he
passed
in
front
of
the
shrine
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
man
when
he
had
gone
some
way
he
looked
back
and
saw
that
the
man
was
no
longer
leaning
against
the
shrine
but
was
moving
as
if
looking
towards
him
the
shoemaker
felt
more
frightened
than
before
and
thought
shall
i
go
back
to
him
or
shall
i
go
on
if
i
go
near
him
something
dreadful
may
happen
who
knows
who
the
fellow
is
he
has
not
come
here
for
any
good
if
i
go
near
him
he
may
jump
up
and
throttle
me
and
there
will
be
no
getting
away
or
if
not
still
be
a
burden
on
one
hands
what
could
i
do
with
a
naked
man
i
could
give
him
my
last
clothes
heaven
only
help
me
to
get
away
so
the
shoemaker
hurried
on
leaving
the
shrine
behind
suddenly
his
conscience
smote
him
and
he
stopped
in
the
road
what
are
you
doing
simon
said
he
to
himself
the
man
may
be
dying
of
want
and
you
slip
past
afraid
have
you
grown
so
rich
as
to
be
afraid
of
robbers
ah
simon
shame
on
you
so
he
turned
back
and
went
up
to
the
man
ii
simon
approached
the
stranger
looked
at
him
and
saw
that
he
was
a
young
man
fit
with
no
bruises
on
his
body
only
evidently
freezing
and
frightened
and
he
sat
there
leaning
back
without
looking
up
at
simon
as
if
too
faint
to
lift
his
eyes
simon
went
close
to
him
and
then
the
man
seemed
to
wake
up
turning
his
head
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
into
simon
face
that
one
look
was
enough
to
make
simon
fond
of
the
man
he
threw
the
felt
boots
on
the
ground
undid
his
sash
laid
it
on
the
boots
and
took
off
his
cloth
coat
it
not
a
time
for
talking
said
he
come
put
this
coat
on
at
once
and
simon
took
the
man
by
the
elbows
and
helped
him
to
rise
as
he
stood
there
simon
saw
that
his
body
was
clean
and
in
good
condition
his
hands
and
feet
shapely
and
his
face
good
and
kind
he
threw
his
coat
over
the
man
shoulders
but
the
latter
could
not
find
the
sleeves
simon
guided
his
arms
into
them
and
drawing
the
coat
well
on
wrapped
it
closely
about
him
tying
the
sash
round
the
man
waist
simon
even
took
off
his
torn
cap
to
put
it
on
the
man
head
but
then
his
own
head
felt
cold
and
he
thought
i
quite
bald
while
he
has
long
curly
hair
so
he
put
his
cap
on
his
own
head
again
it
will
be
better
to
give
him
something
for
his
feet
thought
he
and
he
made
the
man
sit
down
and
helped
him
to
put
on
the
felt
boots
saying
there
friend
now
move
about
and
warm
yourself
other
matters
can
be
settled
later
on
can
you
walk
the
man
stood
up
and
looked
kindly
at
simon
but
could
not
say
a
word
why
do
you
speak
said
simon
it
too
cold
to
stay
here
we
must
be
getting
home
there
now
take
my
stick
and
if
you
feeling
weak
lean
on
that
now
step
out
the
man
started
walking
and
moved
easily
not
lagging
behind
as
they
went
along
simon
asked
him
and
where
do
you
belong
to
not
from
these
parts
i
thought
as
much
i
know
the
folks
hereabouts
but
how
did
you
come
to
be
there
by
the
shrine
i
can
not
tell
has
some
one
been
you
no
one
has
me
god
has
punished
me
of
course
god
rules
all
still
you
have
to
find
food
and
shelter
somewhere
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
simon
was
amazed
the
man
did
not
look
like
a
rogue
and
he
spoke
gently
but
yet
he
gave
no
account
of
himself
still
simon
thought
who
knows
what
may
have
happened
and
he
said
to
the
stranger
well
then
come
home
with
me
and
at
least
warm
yourself
awhile
so
simon
walked
towards
his
home
and
the
stranger
kept
up
with
him
walking
at
his
side
the
wind
had
risen
and
simon
felt
it
cold
under
his
shirt
he
was
getting
over
his
tipsiness
by
now
and
began
to
feel
the
frost
he
went
along
sniffling
and
wrapping
his
wife
coat
round
him
and
he
thought
to
himself
there
now
talk
about
i
went
out
for
and
come
home
without
even
a
coat
to
my
back
and
what
is
more
i
bringing
a
naked
man
along
with
me
matryona
be
pleased
and
when
he
thought
of
his
wife
he
felt
sad
but
when
he
looked
at
the
stranger
and
remembered
how
he
had
looked
up
at
him
at
the
shrine
his
heart
was
glad
iii
simon
wife
had
everything
ready
early
that
day
she
had
cut
wood
brought
water
fed
the
children
eaten
her
own
meal
and
now
she
sat
thinking
she
wondered
when
she
ought
to
make
bread
now
or
tomorrow
there
was
still
a
large
piece
left
if
simon
has
had
some
dinner
in
town
thought
she
and
does
not
eat
much
for
supper
the
bread
will
last
out
another
day
she
weighed
the
piece
of
bread
in
her
hand
again
and
again
and
thought
i
wo
make
any
more
today
we
have
only
enough
flour
left
to
bake
one
batch
we
can
manage
to
make
this
last
out
till
friday
so
matryona
put
away
the
bread
and
sat
down
at
the
table
to
patch
her
husband
shirt
while
she
worked
she
thought
how
her
husband
was
buying
skins
for
a
winter
coat
if
only
the
dealer
does
not
cheat
him
my
good
man
is
much
too
simple
he
cheats
nobody
but
any
child
can
take
him
in
eight
roubles
is
a
lot
of
money
he
should
get
a
good
coat
at
that
price
not
tanned
skins
but
still
a
proper
winter
coat
how
difficult
it
was
last
winter
to
get
on
without
a
warm
coat
i
could
neither
get
down
to
the
river
nor
go
out
anywhere
when
he
went
out
he
put
on
all
we
had
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
he
did
not
start
very
early
today
but
still
it
time
he
was
back
i
only
hope
he
has
not
gone
on
the
spree
hardly
had
matryona
thought
this
when
steps
were
heard
on
the
threshold
and
some
one
entered
matryona
stuck
her
needle
into
her
work
and
went
out
into
the
passage
there
she
saw
two
men
simon
and
with
him
a
man
without
a
hat
and
wearing
felt
boots
matryona
noticed
at
once
that
her
husband
smelt
of
spirits
there
now
he
has
been
drinking
thought
she
and
when
she
saw
that
he
was
coatless
had
only
her
jacket
on
brought
no
parcel
stood
there
silent
and
seemed
ashamed
her
heart
was
ready
to
break
with
disappointment
he
has
drunk
the
money
thought
she
and
has
been
on
the
spree
with
some
fellow
whom
he
has
brought
home
with
him
matryona
let
them
pass
into
the
hut
followed
them
in
and
saw
that
the
stranger
was
a
young
slight
man
wearing
her
husband
coat
there
was
no
shirt
to
be
seen
under
it
and
he
had
no
hat
having
entered
he
stood
neither
moving
nor
raising
his
eyes
and
matryona
thought
he
must
be
a
bad
man
he
afraid
matryona
frowned
and
stood
beside
the
oven
looking
to
see
what
they
would
do
simon
took
off
his
cap
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
as
if
things
were
all
right
come
matryona
if
supper
is
ready
let
us
have
some
matryona
muttered
something
to
herself
and
did
not
move
but
stayed
where
she
was
by
the
oven
she
looked
first
at
the
one
and
then
at
the
other
of
them
and
only
shook
her
head
simon
saw
that
his
wife
was
annoyed
but
tried
to
pass
it
off
pretending
not
to
notice
anything
he
took
the
stranger
by
the
arm
sit
down
friend
said
he
and
let
us
have
some
supper
the
stranger
sat
down
on
the
bench
have
you
cooked
anything
for
us
said
simon
matryona
anger
boiled
over
i
cooked
but
not
for
you
it
seems
to
me
you
have
drunk
your
wits
away
you
went
to
buy
a
coat
but
come
home
without
so
much
as
the
coat
you
had
on
and
bring
a
naked
vagabond
home
with
you
i
have
no
supper
for
drunkards
like
you
that
enough
matryona
do
wag
your
tongue
without
reason
you
had
better
ask
what
sort
of
man
and
you
tell
me
what
you
done
with
the
money
simon
found
the
pocket
of
the
jacket
drew
out
the
note
and
unfolded
it
here
is
the
money
trifonof
did
not
pay
but
promises
to
pay
soon
matryona
got
still
more
angry
he
had
bought
no
but
had
put
his
only
coat
on
some
naked
fellow
and
had
even
brought
him
to
their
house
she
snatched
up
the
note
from
the
table
took
it
to
put
away
in
safety
and
said
i
have
no
supper
for
you
we
ca
feed
all
the
naked
drunkards
in
the
world
there
now
matryona
hold
your
tongue
a
bit
first
hear
what
a
man
has
to
much
wisdom
i
shall
hear
from
a
drunken
fool
i
was
right
in
not
wanting
to
marry
drunkard
the
linen
my
mother
gave
me
you
drank
and
now
you
been
to
buy
a
have
drunk
it
too
simon
tried
to
explain
to
his
wife
that
he
had
only
spent
twenty
kopeks
tried
to
tell
how
he
had
found
the
man
but
matryona
would
not
let
him
get
a
word
in
she
talked
nineteen
to
the
dozen
and
dragged
in
things
that
had
happened
ten
years
before
matryona
talked
and
talked
and
at
last
she
flew
at
simon
and
seized
him
by
the
sleeve
give
me
my
jacket
it
is
the
only
one
i
have
and
you
must
needs
take
it
from
me
and
wear
it
yourself
give
it
here
you
mangy
dog
and
may
the
devil
take
you
simon
began
to
pull
off
the
jacket
and
turned
a
sleeve
of
it
inside
out
matryona
seized
the
jacket
and
it
burst
its
seams
she
snatched
it
up
threw
it
over
her
head
and
went
to
the
door
she
meant
to
go
out
but
stopped
undecided
she
wanted
to
work
off
her
anger
but
she
also
wanted
to
learn
what
sort
of
a
man
the
stranger
was
iv
matryona
stopped
and
said
if
he
were
a
good
man
he
would
not
be
naked
why
he
has
even
a
shirt
on
him

all
right
you
would
say
where
you
came
across
the
fellow

i
am
trying
to
tell
you
said
simon
as
i
came
to
the
shrine

saw
him
sitting
all
naked
and
frozen
it
is
quite
the
weather
to

me
to
him
or
he
would
have
perished
what

i
to
do

have
happened
to
him
so
i
took
him

him
and
brought
him
along
do

so
angry
matryona
it
is
a
sin
remember
we
all
must
die
one
day
angry
words
rose
to
matryona
lips
but
she
looked
at
the
stranger
and
was
silent
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bench
motionless
his
hands
folded
on
his
knees
his
head
drooping
on
his
breast
his
eyes
closed
and
his
brows
knit
as
if
in
pain
matryona
was
silent
and
simon
said
matryona
have
you
no
love
of
god
matryona
heard
these
words
and
as
she
looked
at
the
stranger
suddenly
her
heart
softened
towards
him
she
came
back
from
the
door
and
going
to
the
oven
she
got
out
the
supper
setting
a
cup
on
the
table
she
poured
out
some
kvas
then
she
brought
out
the
last
piece
of
bread
and
set
out
a
knife
and
spoons
eat
if
you
want
to
said
she
simon
drew
the
stranger
to
the
table
take
your
place
young
man
said
he
simon
cut
the
bread
crumbled
it
into
the
broth
and
they
began
to
eat
matryona
sat
at
the
corner
of
the
table
resting
her
head
on
her
hand
and
looking
at
the
stranger
and
matryona
was
touched
with
pity
for
the
stranger
and
began
to
feel
fond
of
him
and
at
once
the
stranger
face
lit
up
his
brows
were
no
longer
bent
he
raised
his
eyes
and
smiled
at
matryona
when
they
had
finished
supper
the
woman
cleared
away
the
things
and
began
questioning
the
stranger
where
are
you
from
said
she
i
am
not
from
these
parts
but
how
did
you
come
to
be
on
the
road
i
may
not
tell
did
some
one
rob
you
god
punished
me
and
you
were
lying
there
naked
yes
naked
and
freezing
simon
saw
me
and
had
pity
on
me
he
took
off
his
coat
put
it
on
me
and
brought
me
here
and
you
have
fed
me
given
me
drink
and
shown
pity
on
me
god
will
reward
you
matryona
rose
took
from
the
window
simon
old
shirt
she
had
been
patching
and
gave
it
to
the
stranger
she
also
brought
out
a
pair
of
trousers
for
him
there
said
she
i
see
you
have
no
shirt
put
this
on
and
lie
down
where
you
please
in
the
loft
or
on
the
oven
the
stranger
took
off
the
coat
put
on
the
shirt
and
lay
down
in
the
loft
matryona
put
out
the
candle
took
the
coat
and
climbed
to
where
her
husband
lay
matryona
drew
the
skirts
of
the
coat
over
her
and
lay
down
but
could
not
sleep
she
could
not
get
the
stranger
out
of
her
mind
when
she
remembered
that
he
had
eaten
their
last
piece
of
bread
and
that
there
was
none
for
tomorrow
and
thought
of
the
shirt
and
trousers
she
had
given
away
she
felt
grieved
but
when
she
remembered
how
he
had
smiled
her
heart
was
glad
long
did
matryona
lie
awake
and
she
noticed
that
simon
also
was
awake
he
drew
the
coat
towards
him
simon
well
you
have
had
the
last
of
the
bread
and
i
have
not
put
any
to
rise
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
tomorrow
perhaps
i
can
borrow
some
of
neighbor
martha
if
we
alive
we
shall
find
something
to
eat
the
woman
lay
still
awhile
and
then
said
he
seems
a
good
man
but
why
does
he
not
tell
us
who
he
is
i
suppose
he
has
his
reasons
simon
well
we
give
but
why
does
nobody
give
us
anything
simon
did
not
know
what
to
say
so
he
only
said
let
us
stop
talking
and
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
v
in
the
morning
simon
awoke
the
children
were
still
asleep
his
wife
had
gone
to
the
neighbor
to
borrow
some
bread
the
stranger
alone
was
sitting
on
the
bench
dressed
in
the
old
shirt
and
trousers
and
looking
upwards
his
face
was
brighter
than
it
had
been
the
day
before
simon
said
to
him
well
friend
the
belly
wants
bread
and
the
naked
body
clothes
one
has
to
work
for
a
living
what
work
do
you
know
i
do
not
know
any
this
surprised
simon
but
he
said
men
who
want
to
learn
can
learn
anything
men
work
and
i
will
work
also
what
is
your
name
michael
well
michael
if
you
do
wish
to
talk
about
yourself
that
is
your
own
affair
but
you
have
to
earn
a
living
for
yourself
if
you
will
work
as
i
tell
you
i
will
give
you
food
and
shelter
may
god
reward
you
i
will
learn
show
me
what
to
do
simon
took
yarn
put
it
round
his
thumb
and
began
to
twist
it
it
is
easy
enough
see
michael
watched
him
put
some
yarn
round
his
own
thumb
in
the
same
way
caught
the
knack
and
twisted
the
yarn
also
then
simon
showed
him
how
to
wax
the
thread
this
also
michael
mastered
next
simon
showed
him
how
to
twist
the
bristle
in
and
how
to
sew
and
this
too
michael
learned
at
once
whatever
simon
showed
him
he
understood
at
once
and
after
three
days
he
worked
as
if
he
had
sewn
boots
all
his
life
he
worked
without
stopping
and
ate
little
when
work
was
over
he
sat
silently
looking
upwards
he
hardly
went
into
the
street
spoke
only
when
necessary
and
neither
joked
nor
laughed
they
never
saw
him
smile
except
that
first
evening
when
matryona
gave
them
supper
vi
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
the
year
went
round
michael
lived
and
worked
with
simon
his
fame
spread
till
people
said
that
no
one
sewed
boots
so
neatly
and
strongly
as
simon
workman
michael
and
from
all
the
district
round
people
came
to
simon
for
their
boots
and
he
began
to
be
well
off
one
winter
day
as
simon
and
michael
sat
working
a
carriage
on
with
three
horses
and
with
bells
drove
up
to
the
hut
they
looked
out
of
the
window
the
carriage
stopped
at
their
door
a
fine
servant
jumped
down
from
the
box
and
opened
the
door
a
gentleman
in
a
fur
coat
got
out
and
walked
up
to
simon
hut
up
jumped
matryona
and
opened
the
door
wide
the
gentleman
stooped
to
enter
the
hut
and
when
he
drew
himself
up
again
his
head
nearly
reached
the
ceiling
and
he
seemed
quite
to
fill
his
end
of
the
room
simon
rose
bowed
and
looked
at
the
gentleman
with
astonishment
he
had
never
seen
any
one
like
him
simon
himself
was
lean
michael
was
thin
and
matryona
was
dry
as
a
bone
but
this
man
was
like
some
one
from
another
world
burly
with
a
neck
like
a
bull
and
looking
altogether
as
if
he
were
cast
in
iron
the
gentleman
puffed
threw
off
his
fur
coat
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
said
which
of
you
is
the
master
bootmaker
i
am
your
excellency
said
simon
coming
forward
then
the
gentleman
shouted
to
his
lad
hey
fedka
bring
the
leather
the
servant
ran
in
bringing
a
parcel
the
gentleman
took
the
parcel
and
put
it
on
the
table
untie
it
said
he
the
lad
untied
it
the
gentleman
pointed
to
the
leather
look
here
shoemaker
said
he
do
you
see
this
leather
yes
your
honor
but
do
you
know
what
sort
of
leather
it
is
simon
felt
the
leather
and
said
it
is
good
leather
good
indeed
why
you
fool
you
never
saw
such
leather
before
in
your
life
it
german
and
cost
twenty
roubles
simon
was
frightened
and
said
where
should
i
ever
see
leather
like
that
just
so
now
can
you
make
it
into
boots
for
me
yes
your
excellency
i
can
then
the
gentleman
shouted
at
him
you
can
can
you
well
remember
whom
you
are
to
make
them
for
and
what
the
leather
is
you
must
make
me
boots
that
will
wear
for
a
year
neither
losing
shape
nor
coming
unsown
if
you
can
do
it
take
the
leather
and
cut
it
up
but
if
you
ca
say
so
i
warn
you
now
if
your
boots
become
unsewn
or
lose
shape
within
a
year
i
will
have
you
put
in
prison
if
they
do
burst
or
lose
shape
for
a
year
i
will
pay
you
ten
roubles
for
your
work
simon
was
frightened
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
glanced
at
michael
and
nudging
him
with
his
elbow
whispered
shall
i
take
the
work
michael
nodded
his
head
as
if
to
say
yes
take
it
simon
did
as
michael
advised
and
undertook
to
make
boots
that
would
not
lose
shape
or
split
for
a
whole
year
calling
his
servant
the
gentleman
told
him
to
pull
the
boot
off
his
left
leg
which
he
stretched
out
take
my
measure
said
he
simon
stitched
a
paper
measure
seventeen
inches
long
smoothed
it
out
knelt
down
wiped
his
hand
well
on
his
apron
so
as
not
to
soil
the
gentleman
sock
and
began
to
measure
he
measured
the
sole
and
round
the
instep
and
began
to
measure
the
calf
of
the
leg
but
the
paper
was
too
short
the
calf
of
the
leg
was
as
thick
as
a
beam
mind
you
do
make
it
too
tight
in
the
leg
simon
stitched
on
another
strip
of
paper
the
gentleman
twitched
his
toes
about
in
his
sock
looking
round
at
those
in
the
hut
and
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
michael
whom
have
you
there
asked
he
that
is
my
workman
he
will
sew
the
boots
mind
said
the
gentleman
to
michael
remember
to
make
them
so
that
they
will
last
me
a
year
simon
also
looked
at
michael
and
saw
that
michael
was
not
looking
at
the
gentleman
but
was
gazing
into
the
corner
behind
the
gentleman
as
if
he
saw
some
one
there
michael
looked
and
looked
and
suddenly
he
smiled
and
his
face
became
brighter
what
are
you
grinning
at
you
fool
thundered
the
gentleman
you
had
better
look
to
it
that
the
boots
are
ready
in
time
they
shall
be
ready
in
good
time
said
michael
mind
it
is
so
said
the
gentleman
and
he
put
on
his
boots
and
his
fur
coat
wrapped
the
latter
round
him
and
went
to
the
door
but
he
forgot
to
stoop
and
struck
his
head
against
the
lintel
he
swore
and
rubbed
his
head
then
he
took
his
seat
in
the
carriage
and
drove
away
when
he
had
gone
simon
said
there
a
figure
of
a
man
for
you
you
could
not
kill
him
with
a
mallet
he
almost
knocked
out
the
lintel
but
little
harm
it
did
him
and
matryona
said
living
as
he
does
how
should
he
not
grow
strong
death
itself
ca
touch
such
a
rock
as
that
vii
then
simon
said
to
michael
well
we
have
taken
the
work
but
we
must
see
we
do
get
into
trouble
over
it
the
leather
is
dear
and
the
gentleman
we
must
make
no
mistakes
come
your
eye
is
truer
and
your
hands
have
become
nimbler
than
mine
so
you
take
this
measure
and
cut
out
the
boots
i
will
finish
off
the
sewing
of
the
vamps
michael
did
as
he
was
told
he
took
the
leather
spread
it
out
on
the
table
folded
it
in
two
took
a
knife
and
began
to
cut
out
matryona
came
and
watched
him
cutting
and
was
surprised
to
see
how
he
was
doing
it
matryona
was
accustomed
to
seeing
boots
made
and
she
looked
and
saw
that
michael
was
not
cutting
the
leather
for
boots
but
was
cutting
it
round
she
wished
to
say
something
but
she
thought
to
herself
perhaps
i
do
not
understand
how
gentleman
boots
should
be
made
i
suppose
michael
knows
more
about
it
and
i
wo
interfere
when
michael
had
cut
up
the
leather
he
took
a
thread
and
began
to
sew
not
with
two
ends
as
boots
are
sewn
but
with
a
single
end
as
for
soft
slippers
again
matryona
wondered
but
again
she
did
not
interfere
michael
sewed
on
steadily
till
noon
then
simon
rose
for
dinner
looked
around
and
saw
that
michael
had
made
slippers
out
of
the
gentleman
leather
ah
groaned
simon
and
he
thought
how
is
it
that
michael
who
has
been
with
me
a
whole
year
and
never
made
a
mistake
before
should
do
such
a
dreadful
thing
the
gentleman
ordered
high
boots
welted
with
whole
fronts
and
michael
has
made
soft
slippers
with
single
soles
and
has
wasted
the
leather
what
am
i
to
say
to
the
gentleman
i
can
never
replace
leather
such
as
this
and
he
said
to
michael
what
are
you
doing
friend
you
have
ruined
me
you
know
the
gentleman
ordered
high
boots
but
see
what
you
have
made
hardly
had
he
begun
to
rebuke
michael
when
went
the
iron
ring
that
hung
at
the
door
some
one
was
knocking
they
looked
out
of
the
window
a
man
had
come
on
horseback
and
was
fastening
his
horse
they
opened
the
door
and
the
servant
who
had
been
with
the
gentleman
came
in
good
day
said
he
good
day
replied
simon
what
can
we
do
for
you
my
mistress
has
sent
me
about
the
boots
what
about
the
boots
why
my
master
no
longer
needs
them
he
is
dead
is
it
possible
he
did
not
live
to
get
home
after
leaving
you
but
died
in
the
carriage
when
we
reached
home
and
the
servants
came
to
help
him
alight
he
rolled
over
like
a
sack
he
was
dead
already
and
so
stiff
that
he
could
hardly
be
got
out
of
the
carriage
my
mistress
sent
me
here
saying
the
bootmaker
that
the
gentleman
who
ordered
boots
of
him
and
left
the
leather
for
them
no
longer
needs
the
boots
but
that
he
must
quickly
make
soft
slippers
for
the
corpse
wait
till
they
are
ready
and
bring
them
back
with
you
that
is
why
i
have
come
michael
gathered
up
the
remnants
of
the
leather
rolled
them
up
took
the
soft
slippers
he
had
made
slapped
them
together
wiped
them
down
with
his
apron
and
handed
them
and
the
roll
of
leather
to
the
servant
who
took
them
and
said
masters
and
good
day
to
you
viii
another
year
passed
and
another
and
michael
was
now
living
his
sixth
year
with
simon
he
lived
as
before
he
went
nowhere
only
spoke
when
necessary
and
had
only
smiled
twice
in
all
those
years
once
when
matryona
gave
him
food
and
a
second
time
when
the
gentleman
was
in
their
hut
simon
was
more
than
pleased
with
his
workman
he
never
now
asked
him
where
he
came
from
and
only
feared
lest
michael
should
go
away
they
were
all
at
home
one
day
matryona
was
putting
iron
pots
in
the
oven
the
children
were
running
along
the
benches
and
looking
out
of
the
window
simon
was
sewing
at
one
window
and
michael
was
fastening
on
a
heel
at
the
other
one
of
the
boys
ran
along
the
bench
to
michael
leant
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
out
of
the
window
look
uncle
michael
there
is
a
lady
with
little
girls
she
seems
to
be
coming
here
and
one
of
the
girls
is
lame
when
the
boy
said
that
michael
dropped
his
work
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
street
simon
was
surprised
michael
never
used
to
look
out
into
the
street
but
now
he
pressed
against
the
window
staring
at
something
simon
also
looked
out
and
saw
that
a
woman
was
really
coming
to
his
hut
leading
by
the
hand
two
little
girls
in
fur
coats
and
woolen
shawls
the
girls
could
hardly
be
told
one
from
the
other
except
that
one
of
them
was
crippled
in
her
left
leg
and
walked
with
a
limp
the
woman
stepped
into
the
porch
and
entered
the
passage
feeling
about
for
the
entrance
she
found
the
latch
which
she
lifted
and
opened
the
door
she
let
the
two
girls
go
in
first
and
followed
them
into
the
hut
good
day
good
folk
pray
come
in
said
simon
what
can
we
do
for
you
the
woman
sat
down
by
the
table
the
two
little
girls
pressed
close
to
her
knees
afraid
of
the
people
in
the
hut
i
want
leather
shoes
made
for
these
two
little
girls
for
spring
we
can
do
that
we
never
have
made
such
small
shoes
but
we
can
make
them
either
welted
or
turnover
shoes
linen
lined
my
man
michael
is
a
master
at
the
work
simon
glanced
at
michael
and
saw
that
he
had
left
his
work
and
was
sitting
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
little
girls
simon
was
surprised
it
was
true
the
girls
were
pretty
with
black
eyes
plump
and
and
they
wore
nice
kerchiefs
and
fur
coats
but
still
simon
could
not
understand
why
michael
should
look
at
them
like
that
just
as
if
he
had
known
them
before
he
was
puzzled
but
went
on
talking
with
the
woman
and
arranging
the
price
having
fixed
it
he
prepared
the
measure
the
woman
lifted
the
lame
girl
on
to
her
lap
and
said
take
two
measures
from
this
little
girl
make
one
shoe
for
the
lame
foot
and
three
for
the
sound
one
they
both
have
the
same
size
feet
they
are
twins
simon
took
the
measure
and
speaking
of
the
lame
girl
said
how
did
it
happen
to
her
she
is
such
a
pretty
girl
was
she
born
so
no
her
mother
crushed
her
leg
then
matryona
joined
in
she
wondered
who
this
woman
was
and
whose
the
children
were
so
she
said
are
not
you
their
mother
then
no
my
good
woman
i
am
neither
their
mother
nor
any
relation
to
them
they
were
quite
strangers
to
me
but
i
adopted
them
they
are
not
your
children
and
yet
you
are
so
fond
of
them
how
can
i
help
being
fond
of
them
i
fed
them
both
at
my
own
breasts
i
had
a
child
of
my
own
but
god
took
him
i
was
not
so
fond
of
him
as
i
now
am
of
them
then
whose
children
are
they
ix
the
woman
having
begun
talking
told
them
the
whole
story
it
is
about
six
years
since
their
parents
died
both
in
one
week
their
father
was
buried
on
the
tuesday
and
their
mother
died
on
the
friday
these
orphans
were
born
three
days
after
their
father
death
and
their
mother
did
not
live
another
day
my
husband
and
i
were
then
living
as
peasants
in
the
village
we
were
neighbors
of
theirs
our
yard
being
next
to
theirs
their
father
was
a
lonely
man
a
in
the
forest
when
felling
trees
one
day
they
let
one
fall
on
him
it
fell
across
his
body
and
crushed
his
bowels
out
they
hardly
got
him
home
before
his
soul
went
to
god
and
that
same
week
his
wife
gave
birth
to
twins
these
little
girls
she
was
poor
and
alone
she
had
no
one
young
or
old
with
her
alone
she
gave
them
birth
and
alone
she
met
her
death
the
next
morning
i
went
to
see
her
but
when
i
entered
the
hut
she
poor
thing
was
already
stark
and
cold
in
dying
she
had
rolled
on
to
this
child
and
crushed
her
leg
the
village
folk
came
to
the
hut
washed
the
body
laid
her
out
made
a
coffin
and
buried
her
they
were
good
folk
the
babies
were
left
alone
what
was
to
be
done
with
them
i
was
the
only
woman
there
who
had
a
baby
at
the
time
i
was
nursing
my
eight
weeks
old
so
i
took
them
for
a
time
the
peasants
came
together
and
thought
and
thought
what
to
do
with
them
and
at
last
they
said
to
me
the
present
mary
you
had
better
keep
the
girls
and
later
on
we
will
arrange
what
to
do
for
them
so
i
nursed
the
sound
one
at
my
breast
but
at
first
i
did
not
feed
this
crippled
one
i
did
not
suppose
she
would
live
but
then
i
thought
to
myself
why
should
the
poor
innocent
suffer
i
pitied
her
and
began
to
feed
her
and
so
i
fed
my
own
boy
and
these
two
the
three
of
them
at
my
own
breast
i
was
young
and
strong
and
had
good
food
and
god
gave
me
so
much
milk
that
at
times
it
even
overflowed
i
used
sometimes
to
feed
two
at
a
time
while
the
third
was
waiting
when
one
had
enough
i
nursed
the
third
and
god
so
ordered
it
that
these
grew
up
while
my
own
was
buried
before
he
was
two
years
old
and
i
had
no
more
children
though
we
prospered
now
my
husband
is
working
for
the
corn
merchant
at
the
mill
the
pay
is
good
and
we
are
well
off
but
i
have
no
children
of
my
own
and
how
lonely
i
should
be
without
these
little
girls
how
can
i
help
loving
them
they
are
the
joy
of
my
life
she
pressed
the
lame
little
girl
to
her
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
she
wiped
the
tears
from
her
cheeks
and
matryona
sighed
and
said
the
proverb
is
true
that
says
may
live
without
father
or
mother
but
one
can
not
live
without
god
so
they
talked
together
when
suddenly
the
whole
hut
was
lighted
up
as
though
by
summer
lightning
from
the
corner
where
michael
sat
they
all
looked
towards
him
and
saw
him
sitting
his
hands
folded
on
his
knees
gazing
upwards
and
smiling
x
the
woman
went
away
with
the
girls
michael
rose
from
the
bench
put
down
his
work
and
took
off
his
apron
then
bowing
low
to
simon
and
his
wife
he
said
farewell
masters
god
has
forgiven
me
i
ask
your
forgiveness
too
for
anything
done
amiss
and
they
saw
that
a
light
shone
from
michael
and
simon
rose
bowed
down
to
michael
and
said
i
see
michael
that
you
are
no
common
man
and
i
can
neither
keep
you
nor
question
you
only
tell
me
this
how
is
it
that
when
i
found
you
and
brought
you
home
you
were
gloomy
and
when
my
wife
gave
you
food
you
smiled
at
her
and
became
brighter
then
when
the
gentleman
came
to
order
the
boots
you
smiled
again
and
became
brighter
still
and
now
when
this
woman
brought
the
little
girls
you
smiled
a
third
time
and
have
become
as
bright
as
day
tell
me
michael
why
does
your
face
shine
so
and
why
did
you
smile
those
three
times
and
michael
answered
light
shines
from
me
because
i
have
been
punished
but
now
god
has
pardoned
me
and
i
smiled
three
times
because
god
sent
me
to
learn
three
truths
and
i
have
learnt
them
one
i
learnt
when
your
wife
pitied
me
and
that
is
why
i
smiled
the
first
time
the
second
i
learnt
when
the
rich
man
ordered
the
boots
and
then
i
smiled
again
and
now
when
i
saw
those
little
girls
i
learn
the
third
and
last
truth
and
i
smiled
the
third
time
and
simon
said
tell
me
michael
what
did
god
punish
you
for
and
what
were
the
three
truths
that
i
too
may
know
them
and
michael
answered
god
punished
me
for
disobeying
him
i
was
an
angel
in
heaven
and
disobeyed
god
god
sent
me
to
fetch
a
woman
soul
i
flew
to
earth
and
saw
a
sick
woman
lying
alone
who
had
just
given
birth
to
twin
girls
they
moved
feebly
at
their
mother
side
but
she
could
not
lift
them
to
her
breast
when
she
saw
me
she
understood
that
god
had
sent
me
for
her
soul
and
she
wept
and
said
of
god
my
husband
has
just
been
buried
killed
by
a
falling
tree
i
have
neither
sister
nor
aunt
nor
mother
no
one
to
care
for
my
orphans
do
not
take
my
soul
let
me
nurse
my
babes
feed
them
and
set
them
on
their
feet
before
i
die
children
can
not
live
without
father
or
mother
and
i
hearkened
to
her
i
placed
one
child
at
her
breast
and
gave
the
other
into
her
arms
and
returned
to
the
lord
in
heaven
i
flew
to
the
lord
and
said
could
not
take
the
soul
of
the
mother
her
husband
was
killed
by
a
tree
the
woman
has
twins
and
prays
that
her
soul
may
not
be
taken
she
says
let
me
nurse
and
feed
my
children
and
set
them
on
their
feet
children
can
not
live
without
father
or
mother
i
have
not
taken
her
soul
and
god
said
the
mother
soul
and
learn
three
truths
learn
what
dwells
in
man
what
is
not
given
to
man
and
what
men
live
by
when
thou
has
learnt
these
things
thou
shalt
return
to
heaven
so
i
flew
again
to
earth
and
took
the
mother
soul
the
babes
dropped
from
her
breasts
her
body
rolled
over
on
the
bed
and
crushed
one
babe
twisting
its
leg
i
rose
above
the
village
wishing
to
take
her
soul
to
god
but
a
wind
seized
me
and
my
wings
drooped
and
dropped
off
her
soul
rose
alone
to
god
while
i
fell
to
earth
by
the
roadside
xi
and
simon
and
matryona
understood
who
it
was
that
had
lived
with
them
and
whom
they
had
clothed
and
fed
and
they
wept
with
awe
and
with
joy
and
the
angel
said
i
was
alone
in
the
field
naked
i
had
never
known
human
needs
cold
and
hunger
till
i
became
a
man
i
was
famished
frozen
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
saw
near
the
field
i
was
in
a
shrine
built
for
god
and
i
went
to
it
hoping
to
find
shelter
but
the
shrine
was
locked
and
i
could
not
enter
so
i
sat
down
behind
the
shrine
to
shelter
myself
at
least
from
the
wind
evening
drew
on
i
was
hungry
frozen
and
in
pain
suddenly
i
heard
a
man
coming
along
the
road
he
carried
a
pair
of
boots
and
was
talking
to
himself
for
the
first
time
since
i
became
a
man
i
saw
the
mortal
face
of
a
man
and
his
face
seemed
terrible
to
me
and
i
turned
from
it
and
i
heard
the
man
talking
to
himself
of
how
to
cover
his
body
from
the
cold
in
winter
and
how
to
feed
wife
and
children
and
i
thought
am
perishing
of
cold
and
hunger
and
here
is
a
man
thinking
only
of
how
to
clothe
himself
and
his
wife
and
how
to
get
bread
for
themselves
he
can
not
help
me
when
the
man
saw
me
he
frowned
and
became
still
more
terrible
and
passed
me
by
on
the
other
side
i
despaired
but
suddenly
i
heard
him
coming
back
i
looked
up
and
did
not
recognize
the
same
man
before
i
had
seen
death
in
his
face
but
now
he
was
alive
and
i
recognized
in
him
the
presence
of
god
he
came
up
to
me
clothed
me
took
me
with
him
and
brought
me
to
his
home
i
entered
the
house
a
woman
came
to
meet
us
and
began
to
speak
the
woman
was
still
more
terrible
than
the
man
had
been
the
spirit
of
death
came
from
her
mouth
i
could
not
breathe
for
the
stench
of
death
that
spread
around
her
she
wished
to
drive
me
out
into
the
cold
and
i
knew
that
if
she
did
so
she
would
die
suddenly
her
husband
spoke
to
her
of
god
and
the
woman
changed
at
once
and
when
she
brought
me
food
and
looked
at
me
i
glanced
at
her
and
saw
that
death
no
longer
dwelt
in
her
she
had
become
alive
and
in
her
too
i
saw
god
then
i
remembered
the
first
lesson
god
had
set
me
what
dwells
in
man
and
i
understood
that
in
man
dwells
love
i
was
glad
that
god
had
already
begun
to
show
me
what
he
had
promised
and
i
smiled
for
the
first
time
but
i
had
not
yet
learnt
all
i
did
not
yet
know
what
is
not
given
to
man
and
what
men
live
by
i
lived
with
you
and
a
year
passed
a
man
came
to
order
boots
that
should
wear
for
a
year
without
losing
shape
or
cracking
i
looked
at
him
and
suddenly
behind
his
shoulder
i
saw
my
comrade
the
angel
of
death
none
but
me
saw
that
angel
but
i
knew
him
and
knew
that
before
the
sun
set
he
would
take
that
rich
man
soul
and
i
thought
to
myself
man
is
making
preparations
for
a
year
and
does
not
know
that
he
will
die
before
evening
and
i
remembered
god
second
saying
what
is
not
given
to
man
what
dwells
in
man
i
already
knew
now
i
learnt
what
is
not
given
him
it
is
not
given
to
man
to
know
his
own
needs
and
i
smiled
for
the
second
time
i
was
glad
to
have
seen
my
comrade
angel
glad
also
that
god
had
revealed
to
me
the
second
saying
but
i
still
did
not
know
all
i
did
not
know
what
men
live
by
and
i
lived
on
waiting
till
god
should
reveal
to
me
the
last
lesson
in
the
sixth
year
came
the
with
the
woman
and
i
recognized
the
girls
and
heard
how
they
had
been
kept
alive
having
heard
the
story
i
thought
mother
besought
me
for
the
children
sake
and
i
believed
her
when
she
said
that
children
can
not
live
without
father
or
mother
but
a
stranger
has
nursed
them
and
has
brought
them
up
and
when
the
woman
showed
her
love
for
the
children
that
were
not
her
own
and
wept
over
them
i
saw
in
her
the
living
god
and
understood
what
men
live
by
and
i
knew
that
god
had
revealed
to
me
the
last
lesson
and
had
forgiven
my
sin
and
then
i
smiled
for
the
third
time
xii
and
the
angel
body
was
bared
and
he
was
clothed
in
light
so
that
eye
could
not
look
on
him
and
his
voice
grew
louder
as
though
it
came
not
from
him
but
from
heaven
above
and
the
angel
said
i
have
learnt
that
all
men
live
not
by
care
for
themselves
but
by
love
it
was
not
given
to
the
mother
to
know
what
her
children
needed
for
their
life
nor
was
it
given
to
the
rich
man
to
know
what
he
himself
needed
nor
is
it
given
to
any
man
to
know
whether
when
evening
comes
he
will
need
boots
for
his
body
or
slippers
for
his
corpse
i
remained
alive
when
i
was
a
man
not
by
care
of
myself
but
because
love
was
present
in
a
and
because
he
and
his
wife
pitied
and
loved
me
the
orphans
remained
alive
not
because
of
their
mother
care
but
because
there
was
love
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
a
stranger
to
them
who
pitied
and
loved
them
and
all
men
live
not
by
the
thought
they
spend
on
their
own
welfare
but
because
love
exists
in
man
i
knew
before
that
god
gave
life
to
men
and
desires
that
they
should
live
now
i
understood
more
than
that
i
understood
that
god
does
not
wish
men
to
live
apart
and
therefore
he
does
not
reveal
to
them
what
each
one
needs
for
himself
but
he
wishes
them
to
live
united
and
therefore
reveals
to
each
of
them
what
is
necessary
for
all
i
have
now
understood
that
though
it
seems
to
men
that
they
live
by
care
for
themselves
in
truth
it
is
love
alone
by
which
they
live
he
who
has
love
is
in
god
and
god
is
in
him
for
god
is
love
and
the
angel
sang
praise
to
god
so
that
the
hut
trembled
at
his
voice
the
roof
opened
and
a
column
of
fire
rose
from
earth
to
heaven
simon
and
his
wife
and
children
fell
to
the
ground
wings
appeared
upon
the
angel
shoulders
and
he
rose
into
the
heavens
and
when
simon
came
to
himself
the
hut
stood
as
before
and
there
was
no
one
in
it
but
his
own
family
three
questions
it
once
occurred
to
a
certain
king
that
if
he
always
knew
the
right
time
to
begin
everything
if
he
knew
who
were
the
right
people
to
listen
to
and
whom
to
avoid
and
above
all
if
he
always
knew
what
was
the
most
important
thing
to
do
he
would
never
fail
in
anything
he
might
undertake
and
this
thought
having
occurred
to
him
he
had
it
proclaimed
throughout
his
kingdom
that
he
would
give
a
great
reward
to
any
one
who
would
teach
him
what
was
the
right
time
for
every
action
and
who
were
the
most
necessary
people
and
how
he
might
know
what
was
the
most
important
thing
to
do
and
learned
men
came
to
the
king
but
they
all
answered
his
questions
differently
in
reply
to
the
first
question
some
said
that
to
know
the
right
time
for
every
action
one
must
draw
up
in
advance
a
table
of
days
months
and
years
and
must
live
strictly
according
to
it
only
thus
said
they
could
everything
be
done
at
its
proper
time
others
declared
that
it
was
impossible
to
decide
beforehand
the
right
time
for
every
action
but
that
not
letting
oneself
be
absorbed
in
idle
pastimes
one
should
always
attend
to
all
that
was
going
on
and
then
do
what
was
most
needful
others
again
said
that
however
attentive
the
king
might
be
to
what
was
going
on
it
was
impossible
for
one
man
to
decide
correctly
the
right
time
for
every
action
but
that
he
should
have
a
council
of
wise
men
who
would
help
him
to
fix
the
proper
time
for
everything
but
then
again
others
said
there
were
some
things
which
could
not
wait
to
be
laid
before
a
council
but
about
which
one
had
at
once
to
decide
whether
to
undertake
them
or
not
but
in
order
to
decide
that
one
must
know
beforehand
what
was
going
to
happen
it
is
only
magicians
who
know
that
and
therefore
in
order
to
know
the
right
time
for
every
action
one
must
consult
magicians
equally
various
were
the
answers
to
the
second
question
some
said
the
people
the
king
most
needed
were
his
councillors
others
the
priests
others
the
doctors
while
some
said
the
warriors
were
the
most
necessary
to
the
third
question
as
to
what
was
the
most
important
occupation
some
replied
that
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
was
science
others
said
it
was
skill
in
warfare
and
others
again
that
it
was
religious
worship
all
the
answers
being
different
the
king
agreed
with
none
of
them
and
gave
the
reward
to
none
but
still
wishing
to
find
the
right
answers
to
his
questions
he
decided
to
consult
a
hermit
widely
renowned
for
his
wisdom
the
hermit
lived
in
a
wood
which
he
never
quitted
and
he
received
none
but
common
folk
so
the
king
put
on
simple
clothes
and
before
reaching
the
hermit
cell
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
leaving
his
behind
went
on
alone
when
the
king
approached
the
hermit
was
digging
the
ground
in
front
of
his
hut
seeing
the
king
he
greeted
him
and
went
on
digging
the
hermit
was
frail
and
weak
and
each
time
he
stuck
his
spade
into
the
ground
and
turned
a
little
earth
he
breathed
heavily
the
king
went
up
to
him
and
said
i
have
come
to
you
wise
hermit
to
ask
you
to
answer
three
questions
how
can
i
learn
to
do
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
who
are
the
people
i
most
need
and
to
whom
should
i
therefore
pay
more
attention
than
to
the
rest
and
what
affairs
are
the
most
important
and
need
my
first
attention
the
hermit
listened
to
the
king
but
answered
nothing
he
just
spat
on
his
hand
and
recommenced
digging
you
are
tired
said
the
king
let
me
take
the
spade
and
work
awhile
for
you
thanks
said
the
hermit
and
giving
the
spade
to
the
king
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
when
he
had
dug
two
beds
the
king
stopped
and
repeated
his
questions
the
hermit
again
gave
no
answer
but
rose
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
spade
and
said
now
rest
let
me
work
a
bit
but
the
king
did
not
give
him
the
spade
and
continued
to
dig
one
hour
passed
and
another
the
sun
began
to
sink
behind
the
trees
and
the
king
at
last
stuck
the
spade
into
the
ground
and
said
i
came
to
you
wise
man
for
an
answer
to
my
questions
if
you
can
give
me
none
tell
me
so
and
i
will
return
home
here
comes
some
one
running
said
the
hermit
let
us
see
who
it
is
the
king
turned
round
and
saw
a
bearded
man
come
running
out
of
the
wood
the
man
held
his
hands
pressed
against
his
stomach
and
blood
was
flowing
from
under
them
when
he
reached
the
king
he
fell
fainting
on
the
ground
moaning
feebly
the
king
and
the
hermit
unfastened
the
clothing
there
was
a
large
wound
in
his
stomach
the
king
washed
it
as
best
he
could
and
bandaged
it
with
his
handkerchief
and
with
a
towel
the
hermit
had
but
the
blood
would
not
stop
flowing
and
the
king
again
and
again
removed
the
bandage
soaked
with
warm
blood
and
washed
and
rebandaged
the
wound
when
at
last
the
blood
ceased
flowing
the
man
revived
and
asked
for
something
to
drink
the
king
brought
fresh
water
and
gave
it
to
him
meanwhile
the
sun
had
set
and
it
had
become
cool
so
the
king
with
the
hermit
help
carried
the
wounded
man
into
the
hut
and
laid
him
on
the
bed
lying
on
the
bed
the
man
closed
his
eyes
and
was
quiet
but
the
king
was
so
tired
with
his
walk
and
with
the
work
he
had
done
that
he
crouched
down
on
the
threshold
and
also
fell
asleep
so
soundly
that
he
slept
all
through
the
short
summer
night
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
it
was
long
before
he
could
remember
where
he
was
or
who
was
the
strange
bearded
man
lying
on
the
bed
and
gazing
intently
at
him
with
shining
eyes
forgive
me
said
the
bearded
man
in
a
weak
voice
when
he
saw
that
the
king
was
awake
and
was
looking
at
him
i
do
not
know
you
and
have
nothing
to
forgive
you
for
said
the
king
you
do
not
know
me
but
i
know
you
i
am
that
enemy
of
yours
who
swore
to
revenge
himself
on
you
because
you
executed
his
brother
and
seized
his
property
i
knew
you
had
gone
alone
to
see
the
hermit
and
i
resolved
to
kill
you
on
your
way
back
but
the
day
passed
and
you
did
not
return
so
i
came
out
from
my
ambush
to
find
you
and
i
came
upon
your
bodyguard
and
they
recognized
me
and
wounded
me
i
escaped
from
them
but
should
have
bled
to
death
had
you
not
dressed
my
wound
i
wished
to
kill
you
and
you
have
saved
my
life
now
if
i
live
and
if
you
wish
it
i
will
serve
you
as
your
most
faithful
slave
and
will
bid
my
sons
do
the
same
forgive
me
the
king
was
very
glad
to
have
made
peace
with
his
enemy
so
easily
and
to
have
gained
him
for
a
friend
and
he
not
only
forgave
him
but
said
he
would
send
his
servants
and
his
own
physician
to
attend
him
and
promised
to
restore
his
property
having
taken
leave
of
the
wounded
man
the
king
went
out
into
the
porch
and
looked
around
for
the
hermit
before
going
away
he
wished
once
more
to
beg
an
answer
to
the
questions
he
had
put
the
hermit
was
outside
on
his
knees
sowing
seeds
in
the
beds
that
had
been
dug
the
day
before
the
king
approached
him
and
said
for
the
last
time
i
pray
you
to
answer
my
questions
wise
man
you
have
already
been
answered
said
the
hermit
still
crouching
on
his
thin
legs
and
looking
up
at
the
king
who
stood
before
him
how
answered
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
king
do
you
not
see
replied
the
hermit
if
you
had
not
pitied
my
weakness
yesterday
and
had
not
dug
those
beds
for
me
but
had
gone
your
way
that
man
would
have
attacked
you
and
you
would
have
repented
of
not
having
stayed
with
me
so
the
most
important
time
was
when
you
were
digging
the
beds
and
i
was
the
most
important
man
and
to
do
me
good
was
your
most
important
business
afterwards
when
that
man
ran
to
us
the
most
important
time
was
when
you
were
attending
to
him
for
if
you
had
not
bound
up
his
wounds
he
would
have
died
without
having
made
peace
with
you
so
he
was
the
most
important
man
and
what
you
did
for
him
was
your
most
important
business
remember
then
there
is
only
one
time
that
is
important
now
it
is
the
most
important
time
because
it
is
the
only
time
when
we
have
any
power
the
most
necessary
man
is
he
with
whom
you
are
for
no
man
knows
whether
he
will
ever
have
dealings
with
any
one
else
and
the
most
important
affair
is
to
do
him
good
because
for
that
purpose
alone
was
man
sent
into
this
life
the
of
surat
after
bernardin
de
in
the
town
of
surat
in
india
was
a
where
many
travellers
and
foreigners
from
all
parts
of
the
world
met
and
conversed
one
day
a
learned
persian
theologian
visited
this
he
was
a
man
who
had
spent
his
life
studying
the
nature
of
the
deity
and
reading
and
writing
books
upon
the
subject
he
had
thought
read
and
written
so
much
about
god
that
eventually
he
lost
his
wits
became
quite
confused
and
ceased
even
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
god
the
shah
hearing
of
this
had
banished
him
from
persia
after
having
argued
all
his
life
about
the
first
cause
this
unfortunate
theologian
had
ended
by
quite
perplexing
himself
and
instead
of
understanding
that
he
had
lost
his
own
reason
he
began
to
think
that
there
was
no
higher
reason
controlling
the
universe
this
man
had
an
african
slave
who
followed
him
everywhere
when
the
theologian
entered
the
the
slave
remained
outside
near
the
door
sitting
on
a
stone
in
the
glare
of
the
sun
and
driving
away
the
flies
that
buzzed
around
him
the
persian
having
settled
down
on
a
divan
in
the
ordered
himself
a
cup
of
opium
when
he
had
drunk
it
and
the
opium
had
begun
to
quicken
the
workings
of
his
brain
he
addressed
his
slave
through
the
open
door
tell
me
wretched
slave
said
he
do
you
think
there
is
a
god
or
not
of
course
there
is
said
the
slave
and
immediately
drew
from
under
his
girdle
a
small
idol
of
wood
there
said
he
that
is
the
god
who
has
guarded
me
from
the
day
of
my
birth
every
one
in
our
country
worships
the
fetish
tree
from
the
wood
of
which
this
god
was
made
this
conversation
between
the
theologian
and
his
slave
was
listened
to
with
surprise
by
the
other
guests
in
the
they
were
astonished
at
the
master
question
and
yet
more
so
at
the
reply
one
of
them
a
brahmin
on
hearing
the
words
spoken
by
the
slave
turned
to
him
and
said
miserable
fool
is
it
possible
you
believe
that
god
can
be
carried
under
a
man
girdle
there
is
one
god
brahma
and
he
is
greater
than
the
whole
world
for
he
created
it
brahma
is
the
one
the
mighty
god
and
in
his
honour
are
built
the
temples
on
the
ganges
banks
where
his
true
priests
the
brahmins
worship
him
they
know
the
true
god
and
none
but
they
a
thousand
score
of
years
have
passed
and
yet
through
revolution
after
revolution
these
priests
have
held
their
sway
because
brahma
the
one
true
god
has
protected
them
so
spoke
the
brahmin
thinking
to
convince
every
one
but
a
jewish
broker
who
was
present
replied
to
him
and
said
no
the
temple
of
the
true
god
is
not
in
india
neither
does
god
protect
the
brahmin
caste
the
true
god
is
not
the
god
of
the
brahmins
but
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
none
does
he
protect
but
his
chosen
people
the
israelites
from
the
commencement
of
the
world
our
nation
has
been
beloved
of
him
and
ours
alone
if
we
are
now
scattered
over
the
whole
earth
it
is
but
to
try
us
for
god
has
promised
that
he
will
one
day
gather
his
people
together
in
jerusalem
then
with
the
temple
of
jerusalem
the
wonder
of
the
ancient
world
restored
to
its
splendor
shall
israel
be
established
a
ruler
over
all
nations
so
spoke
the
jew
and
burst
into
tears
he
wished
to
say
more
but
an
italian
missionary
who
was
there
interrupted
him
what
you
are
saying
is
untrue
said
he
to
the
jew
you
attribute
injustice
to
god
he
can
not
love
your
nation
above
the
rest
nay
rather
even
if
it
be
true
that
of
old
he
favored
the
israelites
it
is
now
nineteen
hundred
years
since
they
angered
him
and
caused
him
to
destroy
their
nation
and
scatter
them
over
the
earth
so
that
their
faith
makes
no
converts
and
has
died
out
except
here
and
there
god
shows
preference
to
no
nation
but
calls
all
who
wish
to
be
saved
to
the
bosom
of
the
catholic
church
of
rome
the
one
outside
whose
borders
no
salvation
can
be
found
so
spoke
the
italian
but
a
protestant
minister
who
happened
to
be
present
growing
pale
turned
to
the
catholic
missionary
and
exclaimed
how
can
you
say
that
salvation
belongs
to
your
religion
those
only
will
be
saved
who
serve
god
according
to
the
gospel
in
spirit
and
in
truth
as
bidden
by
the
word
of
christ
then
a
turk
an
in
the
at
surat
who
was
sitting
in
the
smoking
a
pipe
turned
with
an
air
of
superiority
to
both
the
christians
your
belief
in
your
roman
religion
is
vain
said
he
it
was
superseded
twelve
hundred
years
ago
by
the
true
faith
that
of
mohammed
you
can
not
but
observe
how
the
true
mohammed
faith
continues
to
spread
both
in
europe
and
asia
and
even
in
the
enlightened
country
of
china
you
say
yourselves
that
god
has
rejected
the
jews
and
as
a
proof
you
quote
the
fact
that
the
jews
are
humiliated
and
their
faith
does
not
spread
confess
then
the
truth
of
mohammedanism
for
it
is
triumphant
and
spreads
far
and
wide
none
will
be
saved
but
the
followers
of
mohammed
god
latest
prophet
and
of
them
only
the
followers
of
omar
and
not
of
ali
for
the
latter
are
false
to
the
faith
to
this
the
persian
theologian
who
was
of
the
sect
of
ali
wished
to
reply
but
by
this
time
a
great
dispute
had
arisen
among
all
the
strangers
of
different
faiths
and
creeds
present
there
were
abyssinian
christians
llamas
from
thibet
ismailians
and
fireworshippers
they
all
argued
about
the
nature
of
god
and
how
he
should
be
worshipped
each
of
them
asserted
that
in
his
country
alone
was
the
true
god
known
and
rightly
worshipped
every
one
argued
and
shouted
except
a
chinaman
a
student
of
confucius
who
sat
quietly
in
one
corner
of
the
not
joining
in
the
dispute
he
sat
there
drinking
tea
and
listening
to
what
the
others
said
but
did
not
speak
himself
the
turk
noticed
him
sitting
there
and
appealed
to
him
saying
you
can
confirm
what
i
say
my
good
chinaman
you
hold
your
peace
but
if
you
spoke
i
know
you
would
uphold
my
opinion
traders
from
your
country
who
come
to
me
for
assistance
tell
me
that
though
many
religions
have
been
introduced
into
china
you
chinese
consider
mohammedanism
the
best
of
all
and
adopt
it
willingly
confirm
then
my
words
and
tell
us
your
opinion
of
the
true
god
and
of
his
prophet
yes
yes
said
the
rest
turning
to
the
chinaman
let
us
hear
what
you
think
on
the
subject
the
chinaman
the
student
of
confucius
closed
his
eyes
and
thought
a
while
then
he
opened
them
again
and
drawing
his
hands
out
of
the
wide
sleeves
of
his
garment
and
folding
them
on
his
breast
he
spoke
as
follows
in
a
calm
and
quiet
voice
sirs
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
chiefly
pride
that
prevents
men
agreeing
with
one
another
on
matters
of
faith
if
you
care
to
listen
to
me
i
will
tell
you
a
story
which
will
explain
this
by
an
example
i
came
here
from
china
on
an
english
steamer
which
had
been
round
the
world
we
stopped
for
fresh
water
and
landed
on
the
east
coast
of
the
island
of
sumatra
it
was
midday
and
some
of
us
having
landed
sat
in
the
shade
of
some
cocoanut
palms
by
the
seashore
not
far
from
a
native
village
we
were
a
party
of
men
of
different
nationalities
as
we
sat
there
a
blind
man
approached
us
we
learned
afterwards
that
he
had
gone
blind
from
gazing
too
long
and
too
persistently
at
the
sun
trying
to
find
out
what
it
is
in
order
to
seize
its
light
he
strove
a
long
time
to
accomplish
this
constantly
looking
at
the
sun
but
the
only
result
was
that
his
eyes
were
injured
by
its
brightness
and
he
became
blind
then
he
said
to
himself
the
light
of
the
sun
is
not
a
liquid
for
if
it
were
a
liquid
it
would
be
possible
to
pour
it
from
one
vessel
into
another
and
it
would
be
moved
like
water
by
the
wind
neither
is
it
fire
for
if
it
were
fire
water
would
extinguish
it
neither
is
light
a
spirit
for
it
is
seen
by
the
eye
nor
is
it
matter
for
it
can
not
be
moved
therefore
as
the
light
of
the
sun
is
neither
liquid
nor
fire
nor
spirit
nor
matter
it
is
nothing
so
he
argued
and
as
a
result
of
always
looking
at
the
sun
and
always
thinking
about
it
he
lost
both
his
sight
and
his
reason
and
when
he
went
quite
blind
he
became
fully
convinced
that
the
sun
did
not
exist
with
this
blind
man
came
a
slave
who
after
placing
his
master
in
the
shade
of
a
cocoanut
tree
picked
up
a
cocoanut
from
the
ground
and
began
making
it
into
a
he
twisted
a
wick
from
the
fibre
of
the
cocoanut
squeezed
oil
from
the
nut
in
the
shell
and
soaked
the
wick
in
it
as
the
slave
sat
doing
this
the
blind
man
sighed
and
said
to
him
well
slave
was
i
not
right
when
i
told
you
there
is
no
sun
do
you
not
see
how
dark
it
is
yet
people
say
there
is
a
sun
but
if
so
what
is
it
i
do
not
know
what
the
sun
is
said
the
slave
that
is
no
business
of
mine
but
i
know
what
light
is
here
i
have
made
a
by
the
help
of
which
i
can
serve
you
and
find
anything
i
want
in
the
hut
and
the
slave
picked
up
the
cocoanut
shell
saying
this
is
my
sun
a
lame
man
with
crutches
who
was
sitting
near
by
heard
these
words
and
laughed
you
have
evidently
been
blind
all
your
life
said
he
to
the
blind
man
not
to
know
what
the
sun
is
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
the
sun
is
a
ball
of
fire
which
rises
every
morning
out
of
the
sea
and
goes
down
again
among
the
mountains
of
our
island
each
evening
we
have
all
seen
this
and
if
you
had
had
your
eyesight
you
too
would
have
seen
it
a
fisherman
who
had
been
listening
to
the
conversation
said
it
is
plain
enough
that
you
have
never
been
beyond
your
own
island
if
you
were
not
lame
and
if
you
had
been
out
as
i
have
in
a
you
would
know
that
the
sun
does
not
set
among
the
mountains
of
our
island
but
as
it
rises
from
the
ocean
every
morning
so
it
sets
again
in
the
sea
every
night
what
i
am
telling
you
is
true
for
i
see
it
every
day
with
my
own
eyes
then
an
indian
who
was
of
our
party
interrupted
him
by
saying
i
am
astonished
that
a
reasonable
man
should
talk
such
nonsense
how
can
a
ball
of
fire
possibly
descend
into
the
water
and
not
be
extinguished
the
sun
is
not
a
ball
of
fire
at
all
it
is
the
deity
named
deva
who
rides
for
ever
in
a
chariot
round
the
golden
mountain
meru
sometimes
the
evil
serpents
ragu
and
ketu
attack
deva
and
swallow
him
and
then
the
earth
is
dark
but
our
priests
pray
that
the
deity
may
be
released
and
then
he
is
set
free
only
such
ignorant
men
as
you
who
have
never
been
beyond
their
own
island
can
imagine
that
the
sun
shines
for
their
country
alone
then
the
master
of
an
egyptian
vessel
who
was
present
spoke
in
his
turn
no
said
he
you
also
are
wrong
the
sun
is
not
a
deity
and
does
not
move
only
round
india
and
its
golden
mountain
i
have
sailed
much
on
the
black
sea
and
along
the
coasts
of
arabia
and
have
been
to
madagascar
and
to
the
philippines
the
sun
lights
the
whole
earth
and
not
india
alone
it
does
not
circle
round
one
mountain
but
rises
far
in
the
east
beyond
the
isles
of
japan
and
sets
far
far
away
in
the
west
beyond
the
islands
of
england
that
is
why
the
japanese
call
their
country
that
is
birth
of
the
sun
i
know
this
well
for
i
have
myself
seen
much
and
heard
more
from
my
grandfather
who
sailed
to
the
very
ends
of
the
sea
he
would
have
gone
on
but
an
english
sailor
from
our
ship
interrupted
him
there
is
no
country
he
said
where
people
know
so
much
about
the
sun
movements
as
in
england
the
sun
as
every
one
in
england
knows
rises
nowhere
and
sets
nowhere
it
is
always
moving
round
the
earth
we
can
be
sure
of
this
for
we
have
just
been
round
the
world
ourselves
and
nowhere
knocked
up
against
the
sun
wherever
we
went
the
sun
showed
itself
in
the
morning
and
hid
itself
at
night
just
as
it
does
here
and
the
englishman
took
a
stick
and
drawing
circles
on
the
sand
tried
to
explain
how
the
sun
moves
in
the
heavens
and
goes
round
the
world
but
he
was
unable
to
explain
it
clearly
and
pointing
to
the
pilot
said
this
man
knows
more
about
it
than
i
do
he
can
explain
it
properly
the
pilot
who
was
an
intelligent
man
had
listened
in
silence
to
the
talk
till
he
was
asked
to
speak
now
every
one
turned
to
him
and
he
said
you
are
all
misleading
one
another
and
are
yourselves
deceived
the
sun
does
not
go
round
the
earth
but
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
revolving
as
it
goes
and
turning
towards
the
sun
in
the
course
of
each
hours
not
only
japan
and
the
philippines
and
sumatra
where
we
now
are
but
africa
and
europe
and
america
and
many
lands
besides
the
sun
does
not
shine
for
some
one
mountain
or
for
some
one
island
or
for
some
one
sea
nor
even
for
one
earth
alone
but
for
other
planets
as
well
as
our
earth
if
you
would
only
look
up
at
the
heavens
instead
of
at
the
ground
beneath
your
own
feet
you
might
all
understand
this
and
would
then
no
longer
suppose
that
the
sun
shines
for
you
or
for
your
country
alone
thus
spoke
the
wise
pilot
who
had
voyaged
much
about
the
world
and
had
gazed
much
upon
the
heavens
above
so
on
matters
of
faith
continued
the
chinaman
the
student
of
confucius
it
is
pride
that
causes
error
and
discord
among
men
as
with
the
sun
so
it
is
with
god
each
man
wants
to
have
a
special
god
of
his
own
or
at
least
a
special
god
for
his
native
land
each
nation
wishes
to
confine
in
its
own
temples
him
whom
the
world
can
not
contain
can
any
temple
compare
with
that
which
god
himself
has
built
to
unite
all
men
in
one
faith
and
one
religion
all
human
temples
are
built
on
the
model
of
this
temple
which
is
own
world
every
temple
has
its
fonts
its
vaulted
roof
its
lamps
its
pictures
or
sculptures
its
inscriptions
its
books
of
the
law
its
offerings
its
altars
and
its
priests
but
in
what
temple
is
there
such
a
font
as
the
ocean
such
a
vault
as
that
of
the
heavens
such
lamps
as
the
sun
moon
and
stars
or
any
figures
to
be
compared
with
living
loving
men
where
are
there
any
records
of
goodness
so
easy
to
understand
as
the
blessings
which
god
has
strewn
abroad
for
man
happiness
where
is
there
any
book
of
the
law
so
clear
to
each
man
as
that
written
in
his
heart
what
sacrifices
equal
the
which
loving
men
and
women
make
for
one
another
and
what
altar
can
be
compared
with
the
heart
of
a
good
man
on
which
god
himself
accepts
the
sacrifice
the
higher
a
man
conception
of
god
the
better
will
he
know
him
and
the
better
he
knows
god
the
nearer
will
he
draw
to
him
imitating
his
goodness
his
mercy
and
his
love
of
man
therefore
let
him
who
sees
the
sun
whole
light
filling
the
world
refrain
from
blaming
or
despising
the
superstitious
man
who
in
his
own
idol
sees
one
ray
of
that
same
light
let
him
not
despise
even
the
unbeliever
who
is
blind
and
can
not
see
the
sun
at
all
so
spoke
the
chinaman
the
student
of
confucius
and
all
who
were
present
in
the
were
silent
and
disputed
no
more
as
to
whose
faith
was
the
best
how
much
land
does
a
man
need
i
an
elder
sister
came
to
visit
her
younger
sister
in
the
country
the
elder
was
married
to
a
tradesman
in
town
the
younger
to
a
peasant
in
the
village
as
the
sisters
sat
over
their
tea
talking
the
elder
began
to
boast
of
the
advantages
of
town
life
saying
how
comfortably
they
lived
there
how
well
they
dressed
what
fine
clothes
her
children
wore
what
good
things
they
ate
and
drank
and
how
she
went
to
the
theatre
promenades
and
entertainments
the
younger
sister
was
piqued
and
in
turn
disparaged
the
life
of
a
tradesman
and
stood
up
for
that
of
a
peasant
i
would
not
change
my
way
of
life
for
yours
said
she
we
may
live
roughly
but
at
least
we
are
free
from
anxiety
you
live
in
better
style
than
we
do
but
though
you
often
earn
more
than
you
need
you
are
very
likely
to
lose
all
you
have
you
know
the
proverb
and
gain
are
brothers
twain
it
often
happens
that
people
who
are
wealthy
one
day
are
begging
their
bread
the
next
our
way
is
safer
though
a
life
is
not
a
fat
one
it
is
a
long
one
we
shall
never
grow
rich
but
we
shall
always
have
enough
to
eat
the
elder
sister
said
sneeringly
enough
yes
if
you
like
to
share
with
the
pigs
and
the
calves
what
do
you
know
of
elegance
or
manners
however
much
your
good
man
may
slave
you
will
die
as
you
are
a
dung
your
children
the
same
well
what
of
that
replied
the
younger
of
course
our
work
is
rough
and
coarse
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
sure
and
we
need
not
bow
to
any
one
but
you
in
your
towns
are
surrounded
by
temptations
today
all
may
be
right
but
tomorrow
the
evil
one
may
tempt
your
husband
with
cards
wine
or
women
and
all
will
go
to
ruin
do
such
things
happen
often
enough
pahom
the
master
of
the
house
was
lying
on
the
top
of
the
oven
and
he
listened
to
the
women
chatter
it
is
perfectly
true
thought
he
busy
as
we
are
from
childhood
tilling
mother
earth
we
peasants
have
no
time
to
let
any
nonsense
settle
in
our
heads
our
only
trouble
is
that
we
have
land
enough
if
i
had
plenty
of
land
i
should
fear
the
devil
himself
the
women
finished
their
tea
chatted
a
while
about
dress
and
then
cleared
away
the
and
lay
down
to
sleep
but
the
devil
had
been
sitting
behind
the
oven
and
had
heard
all
that
was
said
he
was
pleased
that
the
peasant
wife
had
led
her
husband
into
boasting
and
that
he
had
said
that
if
he
had
plenty
of
land
he
would
not
fear
the
devil
himself
all
right
thought
the
devil
we
will
have
a
tussle
i
give
you
land
enough
and
by
means
of
that
land
i
will
get
you
into
my
power
ii
close
to
the
village
there
lived
a
lady
a
small
landowner
who
had
an
estate
of
about
three
hundred
acres
she
had
always
lived
on
good
terms
with
the
peasants
until
she
engaged
as
her
steward
an
old
soldier
who
took
to
burdening
the
people
with
fines
however
careful
pahom
tried
to
be
it
happened
again
and
again
that
now
a
horse
of
his
got
among
the
lady
oats
now
a
cow
strayed
into
her
garden
now
his
calves
found
their
way
into
her
he
always
had
to
pay
a
fine
pahom
paid
but
grumbled
and
going
home
in
a
temper
was
rough
with
his
family
all
through
that
summer
pahom
had
much
trouble
because
of
this
steward
and
he
was
even
glad
when
winter
came
and
the
cattle
had
to
be
stabled
though
he
grudged
the
fodder
when
they
could
no
longer
graze
on
the
at
least
he
was
free
from
anxiety
about
them
in
the
winter
the
news
got
about
that
the
lady
was
going
to
sell
her
land
and
that
the
keeper
of
the
inn
on
the
high
road
was
bargaining
for
it
when
the
peasants
heard
this
they
were
very
much
alarmed
well
thought
they
if
the
innkeeper
gets
the
land
he
will
worry
us
with
fines
worse
than
the
lady
steward
we
all
depend
on
that
estate
so
the
peasants
went
on
behalf
of
their
commune
and
asked
the
lady
not
to
sell
the
land
to
the
innkeeper
offering
her
a
better
price
for
it
themselves
the
lady
agreed
to
let
them
have
it
then
the
peasants
tried
to
arrange
for
the
commune
to
buy
the
whole
estate
so
that
it
might
be
held
by
all
in
common
they
met
twice
to
discuss
it
but
could
not
settle
the
matter
the
evil
one
sowed
discord
among
them
and
they
could
not
agree
so
they
decided
to
buy
the
land
individually
each
according
to
his
means
and
the
lady
agreed
to
this
plan
as
she
had
to
the
other
presently
pahom
heard
that
a
neighbor
of
his
was
buying
fifty
acres
and
that
the
lady
had
consented
to
accept
one
half
in
cash
and
to
wait
a
year
for
the
other
half
pahom
felt
envious
look
at
that
thought
he
the
land
is
all
being
sold
and
i
shall
get
none
of
it
so
he
spoke
to
his
wife
other
people
are
buying
said
he
and
we
must
also
buy
twenty
acres
or
so
life
is
becoming
impossible
that
steward
is
simply
crushing
us
with
his
fines
so
they
put
their
heads
together
and
considered
how
they
could
manage
to
buy
it
they
had
one
hundred
roubles
laid
by
they
sold
a
colt
and
one
half
of
their
bees
hired
out
one
of
their
sons
as
a
laborer
and
took
his
wages
in
advance
borrowed
the
rest
from
a
and
so
scraped
together
half
the
purchase
money
having
done
this
pahom
chose
out
a
farm
of
forty
acres
some
of
it
wooded
and
went
to
the
lady
to
bargain
for
it
they
came
to
an
agreement
and
he
shook
hands
with
her
upon
it
and
paid
her
a
deposit
in
advance
then
they
went
to
town
and
signed
the
deeds
he
paying
half
the
price
down
and
undertaking
to
pay
the
remainder
within
two
years
so
now
pahom
had
land
of
his
own
he
borrowed
seed
and
sowed
it
on
the
land
he
had
bought
the
harvest
was
a
good
one
and
within
a
year
he
had
managed
to
pay
off
his
debts
both
to
the
lady
and
to
his
so
he
became
a
landowner
ploughing
and
sowing
his
own
land
making
hay
on
his
own
land
cutting
his
own
trees
and
feeding
his
cattle
on
his
own
pasture
when
he
went
out
to
plough
his
fields
or
to
look
at
his
growing
corn
or
at
his
grass
meadows
his
heart
would
fill
with
joy
the
grass
that
grew
and
the
flowers
that
bloomed
there
seemed
to
him
unlike
any
that
grew
elsewhere
formerly
when
he
had
passed
by
that
land
it
had
appeared
the
same
as
any
other
land
but
now
it
seemed
quite
different
iii
so
pahom
was
well
contented
and
everything
would
have
been
right
if
the
neighboring
peasants
would
only
not
have
trespassed
on
his
and
meadows
he
appealed
to
them
most
civilly
but
they
still
went
on
now
the
communal
herdsmen
would
let
the
village
cows
stray
into
his
meadows
then
horses
from
the
night
pasture
would
get
among
his
corn
pahom
turned
them
out
again
and
again
and
forgave
their
owners
and
for
a
long
time
he
forbore
from
prosecuting
any
one
but
at
last
he
lost
patience
and
complained
to
the
district
court
he
knew
it
was
the
peasants
want
of
land
and
no
evil
intent
on
their
part
that
caused
the
trouble
but
he
thought
i
can
not
go
on
overlooking
it
or
they
will
destroy
all
i
have
they
must
be
taught
a
lesson
so
he
had
them
up
gave
them
one
lesson
and
then
another
and
two
or
three
of
the
peasants
were
fined
after
a
time
pahom
neighbours
began
to
bear
him
a
grudge
for
this
and
would
now
and
then
let
their
cattle
on
his
land
on
purpose
one
peasant
even
got
into
pahom
wood
at
night
and
cut
down
five
young
lime
trees
for
their
bark
pahom
passing
through
the
wood
one
day
noticed
something
white
he
came
nearer
and
saw
the
stripped
trunks
lying
on
the
ground
and
close
by
stood
the
stumps
where
the
tree
had
been
pahom
was
furious
if
he
had
only
cut
one
here
and
there
it
would
have
been
bad
enough
thought
pahom
but
the
rascal
has
actually
cut
down
a
whole
clump
if
i
could
only
find
out
who
did
this
i
would
pay
him
out
he
racked
his
brains
as
to
who
it
could
be
finally
he
decided
it
must
be
one
else
could
have
done
it
se
he
went
to
homestead
to
have
a
look
around
but
he
found
nothing
and
only
had
an
angry
scene
however
he
now
felt
more
certain
than
ever
that
simon
had
done
it
and
he
lodged
a
complaint
simon
was
summoned
the
case
was
tried
and
and
at
the
end
of
it
all
simon
was
acquitted
there
being
no
evidence
against
him
pahom
felt
still
more
aggrieved
and
let
his
anger
loose
upon
the
elder
and
the
judges
you
let
thieves
grease
your
palms
said
he
if
you
were
honest
folk
yourselves
you
would
not
let
a
thief
go
free
so
pahom
quarrelled
with
the
judges
and
with
his
neighbors
threats
to
burn
his
building
began
to
be
uttered
so
though
pahom
had
more
land
his
place
in
the
commune
was
much
worse
than
before
about
this
time
a
rumor
got
about
that
many
people
were
moving
to
new
parts
there
no
need
for
me
to
leave
my
land
thought
pahom
but
some
of
the
others
might
leave
our
village
and
then
there
would
be
more
room
for
us
i
would
take
over
their
land
myself
and
make
my
estate
a
bit
bigger
i
could
then
live
more
at
ease
as
it
is
i
am
still
too
cramped
to
be
comfortable
one
day
pahom
was
sitting
at
home
when
a
peasant
passing
through
the
village
happened
to
call
in
he
was
allowed
to
stay
the
night
and
supper
was
given
him
pahom
had
a
talk
with
this
peasant
and
asked
him
where
he
came
from
the
stranger
answered
that
he
came
from
beyond
the
volga
where
he
had
been
working
one
word
led
to
another
and
the
man
went
on
to
say
that
many
people
were
settling
in
those
parts
he
told
how
some
people
from
his
village
had
settled
there
they
had
joined
the
commune
and
had
had
acres
per
man
granted
them
the
land
was
so
good
he
said
that
the
rye
sown
on
it
grew
as
high
as
a
horse
and
so
thick
that
five
cuts
of
a
sickle
made
a
sheaf
one
peasant
he
said
had
brought
nothing
with
him
but
his
bare
hands
and
now
he
had
six
horses
and
two
cows
of
his
own
pahom
heart
kindled
with
desire
he
thought
why
should
i
suffer
in
this
narrow
hole
if
one
can
live
so
well
elsewhere
i
will
sell
my
land
and
my
homestead
here
and
with
the
money
i
will
start
afresh
over
there
and
get
everything
new
in
this
crowded
place
one
is
always
having
trouble
but
i
must
first
go
and
find
out
all
about
it
myself
towards
summer
he
got
ready
and
started
he
went
down
the
volga
on
a
steamer
to
samara
then
walked
another
three
hundred
miles
on
foot
and
at
last
reached
the
place
it
was
just
as
the
stranger
had
said
the
peasants
had
plenty
of
land
every
man
had
acres
of
communal
land
given
him
for
his
use
and
any
one
who
had
money
could
buy
besides
at
an
acre
as
much
good
freehold
land
as
he
wanted
having
found
out
all
he
wished
to
know
pahom
returned
home
as
autumn
came
on
and
began
selling
off
his
belongings
he
sold
his
land
at
a
profit
sold
his
homestead
and
all
his
cattle
and
withdrew
from
membership
of
the
commune
he
only
waited
till
the
spring
and
then
started
with
his
family
for
the
new
settlement
iv
as
soon
as
pahom
and
his
family
arrived
at
their
new
abode
he
applied
for
admission
into
the
commune
of
a
large
village
he
stood
treat
to
the
elders
and
obtained
the
necessary
documents
five
shares
of
communal
land
were
given
him
for
his
own
and
his
sons
use
that
is
to
say
acres
not
altogether
but
in
different
fields
besides
the
use
of
the
communal
pasture
pahom
put
up
the
buildings
he
needed
and
bought
cattle
of
the
communal
land
alone
he
had
three
times
as
much
as
at
his
former
home
and
the
land
was
good
he
was
ten
times
better
off
than
he
had
been
he
had
plenty
of
arable
land
and
pasturage
and
could
keep
as
many
head
of
cattle
as
he
liked
at
first
in
the
bustle
of
building
and
settling
down
pahom
was
pleased
with
it
all
but
when
he
got
used
to
it
he
began
to
think
that
even
here
he
had
not
enough
land
the
first
year
he
sowed
wheat
on
his
share
of
the
communal
land
and
had
a
good
crop
he
wanted
to
go
on
sowing
wheat
but
had
not
enough
communal
land
for
the
purpose
and
what
he
had
already
used
was
not
available
for
in
those
parts
wheat
is
only
sown
on
virgin
soil
or
on
fallow
land
it
is
sown
for
one
or
two
years
and
then
the
land
lies
fallow
till
it
is
again
overgrown
with
prairie
grass
there
were
many
who
wanted
such
land
and
there
was
not
enough
for
all
so
that
people
quarrelled
about
it
those
who
were
better
off
wanted
it
for
growing
wheat
and
those
who
were
poor
wanted
it
to
let
to
dealers
so
that
they
might
raise
money
to
pay
their
taxes
pahom
wanted
to
sow
more
wheat
so
he
rented
land
from
a
dealer
for
a
year
he
sowed
much
wheat
and
had
a
fine
crop
but
the
land
was
too
far
from
the
village
the
wheat
had
to
be
carted
more
than
ten
miles
after
a
time
pahom
noticed
that
some
were
living
on
separate
farms
and
were
growing
wealthy
and
he
thought
if
i
were
to
buy
some
freehold
land
and
have
a
homestead
on
it
it
would
be
a
different
thing
altogether
then
it
would
all
be
nice
and
compact
the
question
of
buying
freehold
land
recurred
to
him
again
and
again
he
went
on
in
the
same
way
for
three
years
renting
land
and
sowing
wheat
the
seasons
turned
out
well
and
the
crops
were
good
so
that
he
began
to
lay
money
by
he
might
have
gone
on
living
contentedly
but
he
grew
tired
of
having
to
rent
other
people
land
every
year
and
having
to
scramble
for
it
wherever
there
was
good
land
to
be
had
the
peasants
would
rush
for
it
and
it
was
taken
up
at
once
so
that
unless
you
were
sharp
about
it
you
got
none
it
happened
in
the
third
year
that
he
and
a
dealer
together
rented
a
piece
of
pasture
land
from
some
peasants
and
they
had
already
ploughed
it
up
when
there
was
some
dispute
and
the
peasants
went
to
law
about
it
and
things
fell
out
so
that
the
labor
was
all
lost
if
it
were
my
own
land
thought
pahom
i
should
be
independent
and
there
would
not
be
all
this
unpleasantness
so
pahom
began
looking
out
for
land
which
he
could
buy
and
he
came
across
a
peasant
who
had
bought
thirteen
hundred
acres
but
having
got
into
difficulties
was
willing
to
sell
again
cheap
pahom
bargained
and
haggled
with
him
and
at
last
they
settled
the
price
at
roubles
part
in
cash
and
part
to
be
paid
later
they
had
all
but
clinched
the
matter
when
a
passing
dealer
happened
to
stop
at
pahom
one
day
to
get
a
feed
for
his
horse
he
drank
tea
with
pahom
and
they
had
a
talk
the
dealer
said
that
he
was
just
returning
from
the
land
of
the
bashkirs
far
away
where
he
had
bought
thirteen
thousand
acres
of
land
all
for
roubles
pahom
questioned
him
further
and
the
tradesman
said
all
one
need
do
is
to
make
friends
with
the
chiefs
i
gave
away
about
one
hundred
roubles
worth
of
and
carpets
besides
a
case
of
tea
and
i
gave
wine
to
those
who
would
drink
it
and
i
got
the
land
for
less
than
two
cents
an
acre
and
he
showed
pahom
the
saying
the
land
lies
near
a
river
and
the
whole
prairie
is
virgin
soil
pahom
plied
him
with
questions
and
the
tradesman
said
there
is
more
land
there
than
you
could
cover
if
you
walked
a
year
and
it
all
belongs
to
the
bashkirs
they
are
as
simple
as
sheep
and
land
can
be
got
almost
for
nothing
there
now
thought
pahom
with
my
one
thousand
roubles
why
should
i
get
only
thirteen
hundred
acres
and
saddle
myself
with
a
debt
besides
if
i
take
it
out
there
i
can
get
more
than
ten
times
as
much
for
the
money
v
pahom
inquired
how
to
get
to
the
place
and
as
soon
as
the
tradesman
had
left
him
he
prepared
to
go
there
himself
he
left
his
wife
to
look
after
the
homestead
and
started
on
his
journey
taking
his
man
with
him
they
stopped
at
a
town
on
their
way
and
bought
a
case
of
tea
some
wine
and
other
presents
as
the
tradesman
had
advised
on
and
on
they
went
until
they
had
gone
more
than
three
hundred
miles
and
on
the
seventh
day
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
bashkirs
had
pitched
their
tents
it
was
all
just
as
the
tradesman
had
said
the
people
lived
on
the
steppes
by
a
river
in
tents
they
neither
tilled
the
ground
nor
ate
bread
their
cattle
and
horses
grazed
in
herds
on
the
steppe
the
colts
were
tethered
behind
the
tents
and
the
mares
were
driven
to
them
twice
a
day
the
mares
were
milked
and
from
the
milk
kumiss
was
made
it
was
the
women
who
prepared
kumiss
and
they
also
made
cheese
as
far
as
the
men
were
concerned
drinking
kumiss
and
tea
eating
mutton
and
playing
on
their
pipes
was
all
they
cared
about
they
were
all
stout
and
merry
and
all
the
summer
long
they
never
thought
of
doing
any
work
they
were
quite
ignorant
and
knew
no
russian
but
were
enough
as
soon
as
they
saw
pahom
they
came
out
of
their
tents
and
gathered
round
their
visitor
an
interpreter
was
found
and
pahom
told
them
he
had
come
about
some
land
the
bashkirs
seemed
very
glad
they
took
pahom
and
led
him
into
one
of
the
best
tents
where
they
made
him
sit
on
some
down
cushions
placed
on
a
carpet
while
they
sat
round
him
they
gave
him
tea
and
kumiss
and
had
a
sheep
killed
and
gave
him
mutton
to
eat
pahom
took
presents
out
of
his
cart
and
distributed
them
among
the
bashkirs
and
divided
amongst
them
the
tea
the
bashkirs
were
delighted
they
talked
a
great
deal
among
themselves
and
then
told
the
interpreter
to
translate
they
wish
to
tell
you
said
the
interpreter
that
they
like
you
and
that
it
is
our
custom
to
do
all
we
can
to
please
a
guest
and
to
repay
him
for
his
gifts
you
have
given
us
presents
now
tell
us
which
of
the
things
we
possess
please
you
best
that
we
may
present
them
to
you
what
pleases
me
best
here
answered
pahom
is
your
land
our
land
is
crowded
and
the
soil
is
exhausted
but
you
have
plenty
of
land
and
it
is
good
land
i
never
saw
the
like
of
it
the
interpreter
translated
the
bashkirs
talked
among
themselves
for
a
while
pahom
could
not
understand
what
they
were
saying
but
saw
that
they
were
much
amused
and
that
they
shouted
and
laughed
then
they
were
silent
and
looked
at
pahom
while
the
interpreter
said
they
wish
me
to
tell
you
that
in
return
for
your
presents
they
will
gladly
give
you
as
much
land
as
you
want
you
have
only
to
point
it
out
with
your
hand
and
it
is
yours
the
bashkirs
talked
again
for
a
while
and
began
to
dispute
pahom
asked
what
they
were
disputing
about
and
the
interpreter
told
him
that
some
of
them
thought
they
ought
to
ask
their
chief
about
the
land
and
not
act
in
his
absence
while
others
thought
there
was
no
need
to
wait
for
his
return
vi
while
the
bashkirs
were
disputing
a
man
in
a
large
cap
appeared
on
the
scene
they
all
became
silent
and
rose
to
their
feet
the
interpreter
said
this
is
our
chief
himself
pahom
immediately
fetched
the
best
and
five
pounds
of
tea
and
offered
these
to
the
chief
the
chief
accepted
them
and
seated
himself
in
the
place
of
honour
the
bashkirs
at
once
began
telling
him
something
the
chief
listened
for
a
while
then
made
a
sign
with
his
head
for
them
to
be
silent
and
addressing
himself
to
pahom
said
in
russian
well
let
it
be
so
choose
whatever
piece
of
land
you
like
we
have
plenty
of
it
how
can
i
take
as
much
as
i
like
thought
pahom
i
must
get
a
deed
to
make
it
secure
or
else
they
may
say
is
yours
and
afterwards
may
take
it
away
again
thank
you
for
your
kind
words
he
said
aloud
you
have
much
land
and
i
only
want
a
little
but
i
should
like
to
be
sure
which
bit
is
mine
could
it
not
be
measured
and
made
over
to
me
life
and
death
are
in
god
hands
you
good
people
give
it
to
me
but
your
children
might
wish
to
take
it
away
again
you
are
quite
right
said
the
chief
we
will
make
it
over
to
you
i
heard
that
a
dealer
had
been
here
continued
pahom
and
that
you
gave
him
a
little
land
too
and
signed
to
that
effect
i
should
like
to
have
it
done
in
the
same
way
the
chief
understood
yes
replied
he
that
can
be
done
quite
easily
we
have
a
scribe
and
we
will
go
to
town
with
you
and
have
the
deed
properly
sealed
and
what
will
be
the
price
asked
pahom
our
price
is
always
the
same
one
thousand
roubles
a
day
pahom
did
not
understand
a
day
what
measure
is
that
how
many
acres
would
that
be
we
do
not
know
how
to
reckon
it
out
said
the
chief
we
sell
it
by
the
day
as
much
as
you
can
go
round
on
your
feet
in
a
day
is
yours
and
the
price
is
one
thousand
roubles
a
day
pahom
was
surprised
but
in
a
day
you
can
get
round
a
large
tract
of
land
he
said
the
chief
laughed
it
will
all
be
yours
said
he
but
there
is
one
condition
if
you
do
return
on
the
same
day
to
the
spot
whence
you
started
your
money
is
lost
but
how
am
i
to
mark
the
way
that
i
have
gone
why
we
shall
go
to
any
spot
you
like
and
stay
there
you
must
start
from
that
spot
and
make
your
round
taking
a
spade
with
you
wherever
you
think
necessary
make
a
mark
at
every
turning
dig
a
hole
and
pile
up
the
turf
then
afterwards
we
will
go
round
with
a
plough
from
hole
to
hole
you
may
make
as
large
a
circuit
as
you
please
but
before
the
sun
sets
you
must
return
to
the
place
you
started
from
all
the
land
you
cover
will
be
yours
pahom
was
delighted
decided
to
start
early
next
morning
they
talked
a
while
and
after
drinking
some
more
kumiss
and
eating
some
more
mutton
they
had
tea
again
and
then
the
night
came
on
they
gave
pahom
a
to
sleep
on
and
the
bashkirs
dispersed
for
the
night
promising
to
assemble
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
and
ride
out
before
sunrise
to
the
appointed
spot
vii
pahom
lay
on
the
but
could
not
sleep
he
kept
thinking
about
the
land
what
a
large
tract
i
will
mark
off
thought
he
i
can
easily
go
miles
in
a
day
the
days
are
long
now
and
within
a
circuit
of
miles
what
a
lot
of
land
there
will
be
i
will
sell
the
poorer
land
or
let
it
to
peasants
but
i
pick
out
the
best
and
farm
it
i
will
buy
two
and
hire
two
more
laborers
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
acres
shall
be
and
i
will
pasture
cattle
on
the
rest
pahom
lay
awake
all
night
and
dozed
off
only
just
before
dawn
hardly
were
his
eyes
closed
when
he
had
a
dream
he
thought
he
was
lying
in
that
same
tent
and
heard
somebody
chuckling
outside
he
wondered
who
it
could
be
and
rose
and
went
out
and
he
saw
the
bashkir
chief
sitting
in
front
of
the
tent
holding
his
side
and
rolling
about
with
laughter
going
nearer
to
the
chief
pahom
asked
what
are
you
laughing
at
but
he
saw
that
it
was
no
longer
the
chief
but
the
dealer
who
had
recently
stopped
at
his
house
and
had
told
him
about
the
land
just
as
pahom
was
going
to
ask
have
you
been
here
long
he
saw
that
it
was
not
the
dealer
but
the
peasant
who
had
come
up
from
the
volga
long
ago
to
pahom
old
home
then
he
saw
that
it
was
not
the
peasant
either
but
the
devil
himself
with
hoofs
and
horns
sitting
there
and
chuckling
and
before
him
lay
a
man
barefoot
prostrate
on
the
ground
with
only
trousers
and
a
shirt
on
and
pahom
dreamt
that
he
looked
more
attentively
to
see
what
sort
of
a
man
it
was
lying
there
and
he
saw
that
the
man
was
dead
and
that
it
was
himself
he
awoke
what
things
one
does
dream
thought
he
looking
round
he
saw
through
the
open
door
that
the
dawn
was
breaking
it
time
to
wake
them
up
thought
he
we
ought
to
be
starting
he
got
up
roused
his
man
who
was
sleeping
in
his
cart
bade
him
harness
and
went
to
call
the
bashkirs
it
time
to
go
to
the
steppe
to
measure
the
land
he
said
the
bashkirs
rose
and
assembled
and
the
chief
came
too
then
they
began
drinking
kumiss
again
and
offered
pahom
some
tea
but
he
would
not
wait
if
we
are
to
go
let
us
go
it
is
high
time
said
he
viii
the
bashkirs
got
ready
and
they
all
started
some
mounted
on
horses
and
some
in
carts
pahom
drove
in
his
own
small
cart
with
his
servant
and
took
a
spade
with
him
when
they
reached
the
steppe
the
morning
red
was
beginning
to
kindle
they
ascended
a
hillock
called
by
the
bashkirs
a
shikhan
and
dismounting
from
their
carts
and
their
horses
gathered
in
one
spot
the
chief
came
up
to
pahom
and
stretched
out
his
arm
towards
the
plain
see
said
he
all
this
as
far
as
your
eye
can
reach
is
ours
you
may
have
any
part
of
it
you
like
pahom
eyes
glistened
it
was
all
virgin
soil
as
flat
as
the
palm
of
your
hand
as
black
as
the
seed
of
a
poppy
and
in
the
hollows
different
kinds
of
grasses
grew
breast
high
the
chief
took
off
his
cap
placed
it
on
the
ground
and
said
this
will
be
the
mark
start
from
here
and
return
here
again
all
the
land
you
go
round
shall
be
yours
pahom
took
out
his
money
and
put
it
on
the
cap
then
he
took
off
his
outer
coat
remaining
in
his
sleeveless
under
coat
he
unfastened
his
girdle
and
tied
it
tight
below
his
stomach
put
a
little
bag
of
bread
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
tying
a
flask
of
water
to
his
girdle
he
drew
up
the
tops
of
his
boots
took
the
spade
from
his
man
and
stood
ready
to
start
he
considered
for
some
moments
which
way
he
had
better
go
it
was
tempting
everywhere
no
matter
he
concluded
i
will
go
towards
the
rising
sun
he
turned
his
face
to
the
east
stretched
himself
and
waited
for
the
sun
to
appear
above
the
rim
i
must
lose
no
time
he
thought
and
it
is
easier
walking
while
it
is
still
cool
the
sun
rays
had
hardly
flashed
above
the
horizon
before
pahom
carrying
the
spade
over
his
shoulder
went
down
into
the
steppe
pahom
started
walking
neither
slowly
nor
quickly
after
having
gone
a
thousand
yards
he
stopped
dug
a
hole
and
placed
pieces
of
turf
one
on
another
to
make
it
more
visible
then
he
went
on
and
now
that
he
had
walked
off
his
stiffness
he
quickened
his
pace
after
a
while
he
dug
another
hole
pahom
looked
back
the
hillock
could
be
distinctly
seen
in
the
sunlight
with
the
people
on
it
and
the
glittering
tires
of
the
cartwheels
at
a
rough
guess
pahom
concluded
that
he
had
walked
three
miles
it
was
growing
warmer
he
took
off
his
flung
it
across
his
shoulder
and
went
on
again
it
had
grown
quite
warm
now
he
looked
at
the
sun
it
was
time
to
think
of
breakfast
the
first
shift
is
done
but
there
are
four
in
a
day
and
it
is
too
soon
yet
to
turn
but
i
will
just
take
off
my
boots
said
he
to
himself
he
sat
down
took
off
his
boots
stuck
them
into
his
girdle
and
went
on
it
was
easy
walking
now
i
will
go
on
for
another
three
miles
thought
he
and
then
turn
to
the
left
the
spot
is
so
fine
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
lose
it
the
further
one
goes
the
better
the
land
seems
he
went
straight
on
a
for
a
while
and
when
he
looked
round
the
hillock
was
scarcely
visible
and
the
people
on
it
looked
like
black
ants
and
he
could
just
see
something
glistening
there
in
the
sun
ah
thought
pahom
i
have
gone
far
enough
in
this
direction
it
is
time
to
turn
besides
i
am
in
a
regular
sweat
and
very
thirsty
he
stopped
dug
a
large
hole
and
heaped
up
pieces
of
turf
next
he
untied
his
flask
had
a
drink
and
then
turned
sharply
to
the
left
he
went
on
and
on
the
grass
was
high
and
it
was
very
hot
pahom
began
to
grow
tired
he
looked
at
the
sun
and
saw
that
it
was
noon
well
he
thought
i
must
have
a
rest
he
sat
down
and
ate
some
bread
and
drank
some
water
but
he
did
not
lie
down
thinking
that
if
he
did
he
might
fall
asleep
after
sitting
a
little
while
he
went
on
again
at
first
he
walked
easily
the
food
had
strengthened
him
but
it
had
become
terribly
hot
and
he
felt
sleepy
still
he
went
on
thinking
an
hour
to
suffer
a
to
live
he
went
a
long
way
in
this
direction
also
and
was
about
to
turn
to
the
left
again
when
he
perceived
a
damp
hollow
it
would
be
a
pity
to
leave
that
out
he
thought
flax
would
do
well
there
so
he
went
on
past
the
hollow
and
dug
a
hole
on
the
other
side
of
it
before
he
turned
the
corner
pahom
looked
towards
the
hillock
the
heat
made
the
air
hazy
it
seemed
to
be
quivering
and
through
the
haze
the
people
on
the
hillock
could
scarcely
be
seen
ah
thought
pahom
i
have
made
the
sides
too
long
i
must
make
this
one
shorter
and
he
went
along
the
third
side
stepping
faster
he
looked
at
the
sun
it
was
nearly
half
way
to
the
horizon
and
he
had
not
yet
done
two
miles
of
the
third
side
of
the
square
he
was
still
ten
miles
from
the
goal
no
he
thought
though
it
will
make
my
land
lopsided
i
must
hurry
back
in
a
straight
line
now
i
might
go
too
far
and
as
it
is
i
have
a
great
deal
of
land
so
pahom
hurriedly
dug
a
hole
and
turned
straight
towards
the
hillock
ix
pahom
went
straight
towards
the
hillock
but
he
now
walked
with
difficulty
he
was
done
up
with
the
heat
his
bare
feet
were
cut
and
bruised
and
his
legs
began
to
fail
he
longed
to
rest
but
it
was
impossible
if
he
meant
to
get
back
before
sunset
the
sun
waits
for
no
man
and
it
was
sinking
lower
and
lower
oh
dear
he
thought
if
only
i
have
not
blundered
trying
for
too
much
what
if
i
am
too
late
he
looked
towards
the
hillock
and
at
the
sun
he
was
still
far
from
his
goal
and
the
sun
was
already
near
the
rim
pahom
walked
on
and
on
it
was
very
hard
walking
but
he
went
quicker
and
quicker
he
pressed
on
but
was
still
far
from
the
place
he
began
running
threw
away
his
coat
his
boots
his
flask
and
his
cap
and
kept
only
the
spade
which
he
used
as
a
support
what
shall
i
do
he
thought
again
i
have
grasped
too
much
and
ruined
the
whole
affair
i
ca
get
there
before
the
sun
sets
and
this
fear
made
him
still
more
breathless
pahom
went
on
running
his
soaking
shirt
and
trousers
stuck
to
him
and
his
mouth
was
parched
his
breast
was
working
like
a
blacksmith
bellows
his
heart
was
beating
like
a
hammer
and
his
legs
were
giving
way
as
if
they
did
not
belong
to
him
pahom
was
seized
with
terror
lest
he
should
die
of
the
strain
though
afraid
of
death
he
could
not
stop
after
having
run
all
that
way
they
will
call
me
a
fool
if
i
stop
now
thought
he
and
he
ran
on
and
on
and
drew
near
and
heard
the
bashkirs
yelling
and
shouting
to
him
and
their
cries
inflamed
his
heart
still
more
he
gathered
his
last
strength
and
ran
on
the
sun
was
close
to
the
rim
and
cloaked
in
mist
looked
large
and
red
as
blood
now
yes
now
it
was
about
to
set
the
sun
was
quite
low
but
he
was
also
quite
near
his
aim
pahom
could
already
see
the
people
on
the
hillock
waving
their
arms
to
hurry
him
up
he
could
see
the
cap
on
the
ground
and
the
money
on
it
and
the
chief
sitting
on
the
ground
holding
his
sides
and
pahom
remembered
his
dream
there
is
plenty
of
land
thought
he
but
will
god
let
me
live
on
it
i
have
lost
my
life
i
have
lost
my
life
i
shall
never
reach
that
spot
pahom
looked
at
the
sun
which
had
reached
the
earth
one
side
of
it
had
already
disappeared
with
all
his
remaining
strength
he
rushed
on
bending
his
body
forward
so
that
his
legs
could
hardly
follow
fast
enough
to
keep
him
from
falling
just
as
he
reached
the
hillock
it
suddenly
grew
dark
he
looked
up
the
sun
had
already
set
he
gave
a
cry
all
my
labor
has
been
in
vain
thought
he
and
was
about
to
stop
but
he
heard
the
bashkirs
still
shouting
and
remembered
that
though
to
him
from
below
the
sun
seemed
to
have
set
they
on
the
hillock
could
still
see
it
he
took
a
long
breath
and
ran
up
the
hillock
it
was
still
light
there
he
reached
the
top
and
saw
the
cap
before
it
sat
the
chief
laughing
and
holding
his
sides
again
pahom
remembered
his
dream
and
he
uttered
a
cry
his
legs
gave
way
beneath
him
he
fell
forward
and
reached
the
cap
with
his
hands
ah
what
a
fine
fellow
exclaimed
the
chief
he
has
gained
much
land
pahom
servant
came
running
up
and
tried
to
raise
him
but
he
saw
that
blood
was
flowing
from
his
mouth
pahom
was
dead
the
bashkirs
clicked
their
tongues
to
show
their
pity
his
servant
picked
up
the
spade
and
dug
a
grave
long
enough
for
pahom
to
lie
in
and
buried
him
in
it
six
feet
from
his
head
to
his
heels
was
all
he
needed
notes
one
hundred
kopeks
make
a
rouble
the
kopek
is
worth
about
half
a
cent
a
drink
usually
made
from
and
the
brick
oven
in
a
russian
peasant
hut
is
usually
built
so
as
to
leave
a
flat
top
large
enough
to
lie
on
for
those
who
want
to
sleep
in
a
warm
place
desyatins
the
desyatina
is
properly
acres
but
in
this
story
round
numbers
are
used
three
roubles
per
desyatina
five
kopeks
for
a
desyatina
