treat
of

of

at
a
railway
station
seventh
day
of
the
sixth
month
of
meiji
yesterday
a
telegram
from
fukuoka
announced
that
a
desperate
criminal
captured
there
would
be
brought
for
trial
to
kumamoto
on
the
train
due
at
noon
a
kumamoto
policeman
had
gone
to
fukuoka
to
take
the
prisoner
in
charge
four
years
ago
a
strong
thief
entered
some
house
by
night
in
the
street
of
the
wrestlers
terrified
and
bound
the
inmates
and
carried
away
a
number
of
valuable
things
tracked
skillfully
by
the
police
he
was
captured
within
hours
even
before
he
could
dispose
of
his
plunder
but
as
he
was
being
taken
to
the
police
station
he
burst
his
bonds
snatched
the
sword
of
his
captor
killed
him
and
escaped
nothing
more
was
heard
of
him
until
last
week
then
a
kumamoto
detective
happening
to
visit
the
fukuoka
prison
saw
among
the
toilers
a
face
that
had
been
four
years
photographed
upon
his
brain
who
is
that
man
he
asked
the
guard
a
thief
was
the
reply
registered
here
as
kusabe
the
detective
walked
up
to
the
prisoner
and
said
kusabe
is
not
your
name
nomura
teichi
you
are
needed
in
kumamoto
for
murder
the
felon
confessed
all
i
went
with
a
great
throng
of
people
to
witness
the
arrival
at
the
station
i
expected
to
hear
and
see
anger
i
even
feared
possibilities
of
violence
the
murdered
officer
had
been
much
liked
his
relatives
would
certainly
be
among
the
spectators
and
a
kumamoto
crowd
is
not
very
gentle
i
also
thought
to
find
many
police
on
duty
my
anticipations
were
wrong
the
train
halted
in
the
usual
scene
of
hurry
and
noise
scurry
and
clatter
of
passengers
wearing
geta
screaming
of
boys
wanting
to
sell
japanese
newspapers
and
kumamoto
lemonade
outside
the
barrier
we
waited
for
nearly
five
minutes
then
pushed
through
the
wicket
by
a
the
prisoner
appeared
a
large
man
with
head
bowed
down
and
arms
fastened
behind
his
back
prisoner
and
guard
both
halted
in
front
of
the
wicket
and
the
people
pressed
forward
to
see
but
in
silence
then
the
officer
called
out
sugihara
san
sugihara
is
she
present
a
slight
small
woman
standing
near
me
with
a
child
on
her
back
answered
hai
and
advanced
through
the
press
this
was
the
widow
of
the
murdered
man
the
child
she
carried
was
his
son
at
a
wave
of
the
officer
hand
the
crowd
fell
back
so
as
to
leave
a
clear
space
about
the
prisoner
and
his
escort
in
that
space
the
woman
with
the
child
stood
facing
the
murderer
the
hush
was
of
death
not
to
the
woman
at
all
but
to
the
child
only
did
the
officer
then
speak
he
spoke
low
but
so
clearly
that
i
could
catch
every
syllable
little
one
this
is
the
man
who
killed
your
father
four
years
ago
you
had
not
yet
been
born
you
were
in
your
mother
womb
that
you
have
no
father
to
love
you
now
is
the
doing
of
this
man
look
at
him
here
the
officer
putting
a
hand
to
the
chin
sternly
forced
him
to
lift
his
eyes
look
well
at
him
little
boy
do
not
be
afraid
it
is
painful
but
it
is
your
duty
look
at
him
over
the
mother
shoulder
the
boy
gazed
with
eyes
widely
open
as
in
fear
then
he
began
to
sob
then
tears
came
but
steadily
and
obediently
he
still
looked
looked
looked
straight
into
the
cringing
face
the
crowd
seemed
to
have
stopped
breathing
i
saw
the
prisoner
features
distort
i
saw
him
suddenly
dash
himself
down
upon
his
knees
despite
his
fetters
and
beat
his
face
into
the
dust
crying
out
the
while
in
a
passion
of
hoarse
remorse
that
made
one
heart
shake
pardon
pardon
pardon
me
little
one
that
i
did
not
for
hate
was
it
done
but
in
mad
fear
only
in
my
desire
to
escape
very
very
wicked
have
i
been
great
unspeakable
wrong
have
i
done
you
but
now
for
my
sin
i
go
to
die
i
wish
to
die
i
am
glad
to
die
therefore
o
little
one
be
pitiful
forgive
me
the
child
still
cried
silently
the
officer
raised
the
shaking
criminal
the
dumb
crowd
parted
left
and
right
to
let
them
by
then
quite
suddenly
the
whole
multitude
began
to
sob
and
as
the
bronzed
guardian
passed
i
saw
what
i
had
never
seen
before
what
few
men
ever
see
what
i
shall
probably
never
see
again
the
tears
of
a
japanese
policeman
the
crowd
ebbed
and
left
me
musing
on
the
strange
morality
of
the
spectacle
here
was
justice
unswerving
yet
compassionate
forcing
knowledge
of
a
crime
by
the
pathetic
witness
of
its
simplest
result
here
was
desperate
remorse
praying
only
for
pardon
before
death
and
here
was
a
populace
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
in
the
empire
when
angered
comprehending
all
touched
by
all
satisfied
with
the
contrition
and
the
shame
and
filled
not
with
wrath
but
only
with
the
great
sorrow
of
the
sin
through
simple
deep
experience
of
the
difficulties
of
life
and
the
weaknesses
of
human
nature
but
the
most
significant
because
the
most
oriental
fact
of
the
episode
was
that
the
appeal
to
remorse
had
been
made
through
the
criminal
sense
of
fatherhood
that
potential
love
of
children
which
is
so
large
a
part
of
the
soul
of
every
japanese
there
is
a
story
that
the
most
famous
of
all
japanese
robbers
ishikawa
goemon
once
by
night
entering
a
house
to
kill
and
steal
was
charmed
by
the
smile
of
a
baby
which
reached
out
hands
to
him
and
that
he
remained
playing
with
the
little
creature
until
all
chance
of
carrying
out
his
purpose
was
lost
it
is
not
hard
to
believe
this
story
every
year
the
police
records
tell
of
compassion
shown
to
children
by
professional
criminals
some
months
ago
a
terrible
murder
case
was
reported
in
the
local
papers
the
slaughter
of
a
household
by
robbers
seven
persons
had
been
literally
hewn
to
pieces
while
asleep
but
the
police
discovered
a
little
boy
quite
unharmed
crying
alone
in
a
pool
of
blood
and
they
found
evidence
unmistakable
that
the
men
who
slew
must
have
taken
great
care
not
to
hurt
the
child
ii
the
genius
of
japanese
civilization
i
without
losing
a
single
ship
or
a
single
battle
japan
has
broken
down
the
power
of
china
made
a
new
korea
enlarged
her
own
territory
and
changed
the
whole
political
face
of
the
east
astonishing
as
this
has
seemed
politically
it
is
much
more
astonishing
psychologically
for
it
represents
the
result
of
a
vast
play
of
capacities
with
which
the
race
had
never
been
credited
abroad
capacities
of
a
very
high
order
the
psychologist
knows
that
the
adoption
of
western
civilization
within
a
time
of
thirty
years
can
not
mean
the
addition
to
the
japanese
brain
of
any
organs
or
powers
previously
absent
from
it
he
knows
that
it
can
not
mean
any
sudden
change
in
the
mental
or
moral
character
of
the
race
such
changes
are
not
made
in
a
generation
transmitted
civilization
works
much
more
slowly
requiring
even
hundreds
of
years
to
produce
certain
permanent
psychological
results
it
is
in
this
light
that
japan
appears
the
most
extraordinary
country
in
the
world
and
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
whole
episode
of
her
occidentalization
is
that
the
race
brain
could
bear
so
heavy
a
shock
nevertheless
though
the
fact
be
unique
in
human
history
what
does
it
really
mean
nothing
more
than
rearrangement
of
a
part
of
the
machinery
of
thought
even
that
for
thousands
of
brave
young
minds
was
death
the
adoption
of
western
civilization
was
not
nearly
such
an
easy
matter
as
persons
imagined
and
it
is
quite
evident
that
the
mental
readjustments
effected
at
a
cost
which
remains
to
be
told
have
given
good
results
only
along
directions
in
which
the
race
had
always
shown
capacities
of
special
kinds
thus
the
appliances
of
western
industrial
invention
have
worked
admirably
in
japanese
hands
have
produced
excellent
results
in
those
crafts
at
which
the
nation
had
been
skillful
in
other
and
quainter
ways
for
ages
there
has
been
no
transformation
nothing
more
than
the
turning
of
old
abilities
into
new
and
larger
channels
the
scientific
professions
tell
the
same
story
for
certain
forms
of
science
such
as
medicine
surgery
there
are
no
better
surgeons
in
the
world
than
the
japanese
chemistry
microscopy
the
japanese
genius
is
naturally
adapted
and
in
all
these
it
has
done
work
already
heard
of
round
the
world
in
war
and
statecraft
it
has
shown
wonderful
power
but
throughout
their
history
the
japanese
have
been
characterized
by
great
military
and
political
capacity
nothing
remarkable
has
been
done
however
in
directions
foreign
to
the
national
genius
in
the
study
for
example
of
western
music
western
art
western
literature
time
would
seem
to
have
been
simply
wasted
these
things
make
appeal
extraordinary
to
emotional
life
with
us
they
make
no
such
appeal
to
japanese
emotional
life
every
serious
thinker
knows
that
emotional
transformation
of
the
individual
through
education
is
impossible
to
imagine
that
the
emotional
character
of
an
oriental
race
could
be
transformed
in
the
short
space
of
thirty
years
by
the
contact
of
occidental
ideas
is
absurd
emotional
life
which
is
older
than
intellectual
life
and
deeper
can
no
more
be
altered
suddenly
by
a
change
of
milieu
than
the
surface
of
a
mirror
can
be
changed
by
passing
reflections
all
that
japan
has
been
able
to
do
so
miraculously
well
has
been
done
without
any
and
those
who
imagine
her
emotionally
closer
to
us
than
she
may
have
been
thirty
years
ago
ignore
facts
of
science
which
admit
of
no
argument
sympathy
is
limited
by
comprehension
we
may
sympathize
to
the
same
degree
that
we
understand
one
may
imagine
that
he
sympathizes
with
a
japanese
or
a
chinese
but
the
sympathy
can
never
be
real
to
more
than
a
small
extent
outside
of
the
simplest
phases
of
common
emotional
life
those
phases
in
which
child
and
man
are
at
one
the
more
complex
feelings
of
the
oriental
have
been
composed
by
combinations
of
experiences
ancestral
and
individual
which
have
had
no
really
precise
correspondence
in
western
life
and
which
we
can
therefore
not
fully
know
for
converse
reasons
the
japanese
can
not
even
though
they
would
give
europeans
their
best
sympathy
but
while
it
remains
impossible
for
the
man
of
the
west
to
discern
the
true
color
of
japanese
life
either
intellectual
or
emotional
since
the
one
is
woven
into
the
other
it
is
equally
impossible
for
him
to
escape
the
conviction
that
compared
with
his
own
it
is
very
small
it
is
dainty
it
holds
delicate
potentialities
of
rarest
interest
and
value
but
it
is
otherwise
so
small
that
western
life
by
contrast
with
it
seems
almost
supernatural
for
we
must
judge
visible
and
measurable
manifestations
so
judging
what
a
contrast
between
the
emotional
and
intellectual
worlds
of
west
and
east
far
less
striking
that
between
the
frail
wooden
streets
of
the
japanese
capital
and
the
tremendous
solidity
of
a
thoroughfare
in
paris
or
london
when
one
compares
the
utterances
which
west
and
east
have
given
to
their
dreams
their
aspirations
their
sensations
a
gothic
cathedral
with
a
shinto
temple
an
opera
by
verdi
or
a
trilogy
by
wagner
with
a
performance
of
geisha
a
european
epic
with
a
japanese
poem
how
incalculable
the
difference
in
emotional
volume
in
imaginative
power
in
artistic
synthesis
true
our
music
is
an
essentially
modern
art
but
in
looking
back
through
all
our
past
the
difference
in
creative
force
is
scarcely
less
marked
not
surely
in
the
period
of
roman
magnificence
of
marble
amphitheatres
and
of
aqueducts
spanning
provinces
nor
in
the
greek
period
of
the
divine
in
sculpture
and
of
the
supreme
in
literature
and
this
leads
to
the
subject
of
another
wonderful
fact
in
the
sudden
development
of
japanese
power
where
are
the
outward
material
signs
of
that
immense
new
force
she
has
been
showing
both
in
productivity
and
in
war
nowhere
that
which
we
miss
in
her
emotional
and
intellectual
life
is
missing
also
from
her
industrial
and
commercial
life
largeness
the
land
remains
what
it
was
before
its
face
has
scarcely
been
modified
by
all
the
changes
of
meiji
the
miniature
railways
and
telegraph
poles
the
bridges
and
tunnels
might
almost
escape
notice
in
the
ancient
green
of
the
landscapes
in
all
the
cities
with
the
exception
of
the
open
ports
and
their
little
foreign
settlements
there
exists
hardly
a
street
vista
suggesting
the
teaching
of
western
ideas
you
might
journey
two
hundred
miles
through
the
interior
of
the
country
looking
in
vain
for
large
manifestations
of
the
new
civilization
in
no
place
do
you
find
commerce
exhibiting
its
ambition
in
gigantic
warehouses
or
industry
expanding
its
machinery
under
acres
of
roofing
a
japanese
city
is
still
as
it
was
ten
centuries
ago
little
more
than
a
wilderness
of
wooden
sheds
picturesque
indeed
as
paper
lanterns
are
but
scarcely
less
frail
and
there
is
no
great
stir
and
noise
anywhere
no
heavy
traffic
no
booming
and
rumbling
no
furious
haste
in
tokyo
itself
you
may
enjoy
if
you
wish
the
peace
of
a
country
village
this
want
of
visible
or
audible
signs
of
the
force
which
is
now
menacing
the
markets
of
the
west
and
changing
the
maps
of
the
far
east
gives
one
a
queer
i
might
even
say
a
weird
feeling
it
is
almost
the
sensation
received
when
after
climbing
through
miles
of
silence
to
reach
some
shinto
shrine
you
find
voidness
only
and
solitude
an
elfish
empty
little
wooden
structure
mouldering
in
shadows
a
thousand
years
old
the
strength
of
japan
like
the
strength
of
her
ancient
faith
needs
little
material
display
both
exist
where
the
deepest
real
power
of
any
great
people
exists
in
the
race
ghost
in
one
limited
sense
western
art
has
influenced
japanese
literature
and
drama
but
the
character
of
the
influence
proves
the
racial
difference
to
which
i
refer
european
plays
have
been
reshaped
for
the
japanese
stage
and
european
novels
rewritten
for
japanese
readers
but
a
literal
version
is
rarely
attempted
for
the
original
incidents
thoughts
and
emotions
would
be
unintelligible
to
the
average
reader
or
playgoer
plots
are
adopted
sentiments
and
incidents
are
totally
transformed
the
new
magdalen
becomes
a
japanese
girl
who
married
an
eta
victor
hugo
becomes
a
tale
of
the
japanese
civil
war
and
enjolras
a
japanese
student
there
have
been
a
few
rare
exceptions
including
the
marked
success
of
a
literal
translation
of
the
of
ii
as
i
muse
the
remembrance
of
a
great
city
comes
back
to
me
a
city
walled
up
to
the
sky
and
roaring
like
the
sea
the
memory
of
that
roar
returns
first
then
the
vision
defines
a
chasm
which
is
a
street
between
mountains
which
are
houses
i
am
tired
because
i
have
walked
many
miles
between
those
precipices
of
masonry
and
have
trodden
no
earth
only
slabs
of
rock
and
have
heard
nothing
but
thunder
of
tumult
deep
below
those
huge
pavements
i
know
there
is
a
cavernous
world
tremendous
systems
underlying
systems
of
ways
contrived
for
water
and
steam
and
fire
on
either
hand
tower
facades
pierced
by
scores
of
tiers
of
windows
cliffs
of
architecture
shutting
out
the
sun
above
the
pale
blue
streak
of
sky
is
cut
by
a
maze
of
spidery
lines
an
infinite
cobweb
of
electric
wires
in
that
block
on
the
right
there
dwell
nine
thousand
souls
the
tenants
of
the
edifice
facing
it
pay
the
annual
rent
of
a
million
dollars
seven
millions
scarcely
covered
the
cost
of
those
bulks
overshadowing
the
square
beyond
and
there
are
miles
of
such
stairways
of
steel
and
cement
of
brass
and
stone
with
costliest
balustrades
ascend
through
the
decades
and
of
stories
but
no
foot
treads
them
by
by
steam
by
electricity
men
go
up
and
down
the
heights
are
too
dizzy
the
distances
too
great
for
the
use
of
the
limbs
my
friend
who
pays
rent
of
five
thousand
dollars
for
his
rooms
in
the
fourteenth
story
of
a
monstrosity
not
far
off
has
never
trodden
his
stairway
i
am
walking
for
curiosity
alone
with
a
serious
purpose
i
should
not
walk
the
spaces
are
too
broad
the
time
is
too
precious
for
such
slow
exertion
men
travel
from
district
to
district
from
house
to
office
by
steam
heights
are
too
great
for
the
voice
to
traverse
orders
are
given
and
obeyed
by
machinery
by
electricity
doors
are
opened
with
one
touch
a
hundred
rooms
are
lighted
or
heated
and
all
this
enormity
is
hard
grim
dumb
it
is
the
enormity
of
mathematical
power
applied
to
utilitarian
ends
of
solidity
and
durability
these
leagues
of
palaces
of
warehouses
of
business
structures
of
buildings
describable
and
indescribable
are
not
beautiful
but
sinister
one
feels
depressed
by
the
mere
sensation
of
the
enormous
life
which
created
them
life
without
sympathy
of
their
prodigious
manifestation
of
power
power
pity
they
are
the
architectural
utterance
of
the
new
industrial
age
and
there
is
no
halt
in
the
thunder
of
wheels
in
the
storming
of
hoofs
and
of
human
feet
to
ask
a
question
one
must
shout
into
the
ear
of
the
questioned
to
see
to
understand
to
move
in
that
medium
needs
experience
the
unaccustomed
feels
the
sensation
of
being
in
a
panic
in
a
tempest
in
a
cyclone
yet
all
this
is
order
the
monster
streets
leap
rivers
span
with
bridges
of
stone
bridges
of
steel
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
a
bewilderment
of
masts
a
of
rigging
conceals
the
shores
which
are
cliffs
of
masonry
trees
in
a
forest
stand
less
thickly
branches
in
a
forest
mingle
less
closely
than
the
masts
and
spars
of
that
immeasurable
maze
yet
all
is
order
iii
generally
speaking
we
construct
for
endurance
the
japanese
for
impermanency
few
things
for
common
use
are
made
in
japan
with
a
view
to
durability
the
straw
sandals
worn
out
and
replaced
at
each
stage
of
a
journey
the
robe
consisting
of
a
few
simple
widths
loosely
stitched
together
for
wearing
and
unstitched
again
for
washing
the
fresh
chopsticks
served
to
each
new
guest
at
a
hotel
the
light
shoji
frames
serving
at
once
for
windows
and
walls
and
repapered
twice
a
year
the
mattings
renewed
every
autumn
all
these
are
but
random
examples
of
countless
small
things
in
daily
life
that
illustrate
the
national
contentment
with
impermanency
what
is
the
story
of
a
common
japanese
dwelling
leaving
my
home
in
the
morning
i
observe
as
i
pass
the
corner
of
the
next
street
crossing
mine
some
men
setting
up
bamboo
poles
on
a
vacant
lot
there
returning
after
five
hours
absence
i
find
on
the
same
lot
the
skeleton
of
a
house
next
forenoon
i
see
that
the
walls
are
nearly
finished
already
mud
and
wattles
by
sundown
the
roof
has
been
completely
tiled
on
the
following
morning
i
observe
that
the
mattings
have
been
put
down
and
the
inside
plastering
has
been
finished
in
five
days
the
house
is
completed
this
of
course
is
a
cheap
building
a
fine
one
would
take
much
longer
to
put
up
and
finish
but
japanese
cities
are
for
the
most
part
composed
of
such
common
buildings
they
are
as
cheap
as
they
are
simple
i
can
not
now
remember
where
i
first
met
with
the
observation
that
the
curve
of
the
chinese
roof
might
preserve
the
memory
of
the
nomad
tent
the
idea
haunted
me
long
after
i
had
ungratefully
forgotten
the
book
in
which
i
found
it
and
when
i
first
saw
in
izumo
the
singular
structure
of
the
old
shinto
temples
with
queer
at
their
and
upon
their
the
suggestion
of
the
forgotten
essayist
about
the
possible
origin
of
much
less
ancient
forms
returned
to
me
with
great
force
but
there
is
much
in
japan
besides
primitive
architectural
traditions
to
indicate
a
nomadic
ancestry
for
the
race
always
and
everywhere
there
is
a
total
absence
of
what
we
would
call
solidity
and
the
characteristics
of
impermanence
seem
to
mark
almost
everything
in
the
exterior
life
of
the
people
except
indeed
the
immemorial
costume
of
the
peasant
and
the
shape
of
the
implements
of
his
toil
not
to
dwell
upon
the
fact
that
even
during
the
comparatively
brief
period
of
her
written
history
japan
has
had
more
than
sixty
capitals
of
which
the
greater
number
have
completely
disappeared
it
may
be
broadly
stated
that
every
japanese
city
is
rebuilt
within
the
time
of
a
generation
some
temples
and
a
few
colossal
fortresses
offer
exceptions
but
as
a
general
rule
the
japanese
city
changes
its
substance
if
not
its
form
in
the
lifetime
of
a
man
fires
and
many
other
causes
partly
account
for
this
the
chief
reason
however
is
that
houses
are
not
built
to
last
the
common
people
have
no
ancestral
homes
the
dearest
spot
to
all
is
not
the
place
of
birth
but
the
place
of
burial
and
there
is
little
that
is
permanent
save
the
of
the
dead
and
the
sites
of
the
ancient
shrines
the
land
itself
is
a
land
of
impermanence
rivers
shift
their
courses
coasts
their
outline
plains
their
level
volcanic
peaks
heighten
or
crumble
valleys
are
blocked
by
or
landslides
lakes
appear
and
disappear
even
the
matchless
shape
of
fuji
that
snowy
miracle
which
has
been
the
inspiration
of
artists
for
centuries
is
said
to
have
been
slightly
changed
since
my
advent
to
the
country
and
not
a
few
other
mountains
have
in
the
same
short
time
taken
totally
new
forms
only
the
general
lines
of
the
land
the
general
aspects
of
its
nature
the
general
character
of
the
seasons
remain
fixed
even
the
very
beauty
of
the
landscapes
is
largely
illusive
a
beauty
of
shifting
colors
and
moving
mists
only
he
to
whom
those
landscapes
are
familiar
can
know
how
their
mountain
vapors
make
mockery
of
real
changes
which
have
been
and
ghostly
predictions
of
other
changes
yet
to
be
in
the
history
of
the
archipelago
the
gods
indeed
remain
haunt
their
homes
upon
the
hills
diffuse
a
soft
religious
awe
through
the
twilight
of
their
groves
perhaps
because
they
are
without
form
and
substance
their
shrines
seldom
pass
utterly
into
oblivion
like
the
dwellings
of
men
but
every
shinto
temple
is
necessarily
rebuilt
at
more
or
less
brief
intervals
and
the
holiest
the
shrine
of
ise
in
obedience
to
immemorial
custom
must
be
demolished
every
twenty
years
and
its
timbers
cut
into
thousands
of
tiny
charms
which
are
distributed
to
pilgrims
from
aryan
india
through
china
came
buddhism
with
its
vast
doctrine
of
impermanency
the
builders
of
the
first
buddhist
temples
in
japan
architects
of
another
race
built
well
witness
the
chinese
structures
at
kamakura
that
have
survived
so
many
centuries
while
of
the
great
city
which
once
surrounded
them
not
a
trace
remains
but
the
psychical
influence
of
buddhism
could
in
no
land
impel
minds
to
the
love
of
material
stability
the
teaching
that
the
universe
is
an
illusion
that
life
is
but
one
momentary
halt
upon
an
infinite
journey
that
all
attachment
to
persons
to
places
or
to
things
must
be
fraught
with
sorrow
that
only
through
suppression
of
every
desire
even
the
desire
of
nirvana
itself
can
humanity
reach
the
eternal
peace
certainly
harmonized
with
the
older
racial
feeling
though
the
people
never
much
occupied
themselves
with
the
profounder
philosophy
of
the
foreign
faith
its
doctrine
of
impermanency
must
in
course
of
time
have
profoundly
influenced
national
character
it
explained
and
consoled
it
imparted
new
capacity
to
bear
all
things
bravely
it
strengthened
that
patience
which
is
a
trait
of
the
race
even
in
japanese
art
developed
if
not
actually
created
under
buddhist
influence
the
doctrine
of
impermanency
has
left
its
traces
buddhism
taught
that
nature
was
a
dream
an
illusion
a
phantasmagoria
but
it
also
taught
men
how
to
seize
the
fleeting
impressions
of
that
dream
and
how
to
interpret
them
in
relation
to
the
highest
truth
and
they
learned
well
in
the
flushed
splendor
of
the
of
spring
in
the
coming
and
the
going
of
the
cicada
in
the
dying
crimson
of
autumn
foliage
in
the
ghostly
beauty
of
snow
in
the
delusive
motion
of
wave
or
cloud
they
saw
old
parables
of
perpetual
meaning
even
their
calamities
fire
flood
earthquake
pestilence
interpreted
to
them
unceasingly
the
doctrine
of
the
eternal
vanishing
things
which
exist
in
time
must
perish
the
forests
the
mountains
all
things
thus
exist
in
time
are
born
all
things
having
sun
and
moon
sakra
himself
with
all
the
multitude
of
his
attendants
will
all
without
exception
perish
there
is
not
one
that
will
the
beginning
things
were
fixed
in
the
end
again
they
separate
different
combinations
cause
other
substance
for
in
nature
there
is
no
uniform
and
constant
component
things
must
grow
old
impermanent
are
all
component
things
even
unto
a
grain
of
sesamum
seed
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
compound
which
is
permanent
all
are
transient
all
have
the
inherent
quality
of
component
things
without
exception
are
impermanent
unstable
despicable
sure
to
depart
disintegrating
all
are
temporary
as
a
mirage
as
a
phantom
or
as
foam
even
as
all
earthen
vessels
made
by
the
potter
end
in
being
broken
so
end
the
lives
of
a
belief
in
matter
itself
is
unmentionable
and
inexpressible
it
is
neither
a
thing
nor
and
this
is
known
even
by
children
and
ignorant
iv
now
it
is
worth
while
to
inquire
if
there
be
not
some
compensatory
value
attaching
to
this
impermanency
and
this
smallness
in
the
national
life
nothing
is
more
characteristic
of
that
life
than
its
extreme
fluidity
the
japanese
population
represents
a
medium
whose
particles
are
in
perpetual
circulation
the
motion
is
in
itself
peculiar
it
is
larger
and
more
eccentric
than
the
motion
of
occidental
populations
though
feebler
between
points
it
is
also
much
more
natural
so
natural
that
it
could
not
exist
in
western
civilization
the
relative
mobility
of
a
european
population
and
the
japanese
population
might
be
expressed
by
a
comparison
between
certain
high
velocities
of
vibration
and
certain
low
ones
but
the
high
velocities
would
represent
in
such
a
comparison
the
consequence
of
artificial
force
applied
the
slower
vibrations
would
not
and
this
difference
of
kind
would
mean
more
than
surface
indications
could
announce
in
one
sense
americans
may
be
right
in
thinking
themselves
great
travelers
in
another
they
are
certainly
wrong
the
man
of
the
people
in
america
can
not
compare
as
a
traveler
with
the
man
of
the
people
in
japan
and
of
course
in
considering
relative
mobility
of
populations
one
must
consider
chiefly
the
great
masses
the
workers
not
merely
the
small
class
of
wealth
in
their
own
country
the
japanese
are
the
greatest
travelers
of
any
civilized
people
they
are
the
greatest
travelers
because
even
in
a
land
composed
mainly
of
mountain
chains
they
recognize
no
obstacles
to
travel
the
japanese
who
travels
most
is
not
the
man
who
needs
railways
or
steamers
to
carry
him
now
with
us
the
common
worker
is
incomparably
less
free
than
the
common
worker
in
japan
he
is
less
free
because
of
the
more
complicated
mechanism
of
occidental
societies
whose
forces
tend
to
agglomeration
and
solid
integration
he
is
less
free
because
the
social
and
industrial
machinery
on
which
he
must
depend
reshapes
him
to
its
own
particular
requirements
and
always
so
as
to
evolve
some
special
and
artificial
capacity
at
the
cost
of
other
inherent
capacity
he
is
less
free
because
he
must
live
at
a
standard
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
win
financial
independence
by
mere
thrift
to
achieve
any
such
independence
he
must
possess
exceptional
character
and
exceptional
faculties
greater
than
those
of
thousands
of
exceptional
competitors
equally
eager
to
escape
from
the
same
thralldom
in
brief
then
he
is
less
independent
because
the
special
character
of
his
civilization
numbs
his
natural
power
to
live
without
the
help
of
machinery
or
large
capital
to
live
thus
artificially
means
to
lose
sooner
or
later
the
power
of
independent
movement
before
a
western
man
can
move
he
has
many
things
to
consider
before
a
japanese
moves
he
has
nothing
to
consider
he
simply
leaves
the
place
he
dislikes
and
goes
to
the
place
he
wishes
without
any
trouble
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
him
poverty
is
not
an
obstacle
but
a
stimulus
impedimenta
he
has
none
or
only
such
as
he
can
dispose
of
in
a
few
minutes
distances
have
no
significance
for
him
nature
has
given
him
perfect
feet
that
can
spring
him
over
fifty
miles
a
day
without
pain
a
stomach
whose
chemistry
can
extract
ample
nourishment
from
food
on
which
no
european
could
live
and
a
constitution
that
scorns
heat
cold
and
damp
alike
because
still
unimpaired
by
unhealthy
clothing
by
superfluous
comforts
by
the
habit
of
seeking
warmth
from
grates
and
stoves
and
by
the
habit
of
wearing
leather
shoes
it
seems
to
me
that
the
character
of
our
footgear
signifies
more
than
is
commonly
supposed
the
footgear
represents
in
itself
a
check
upon
individual
freedom
it
signifies
this
even
in
costliness
but
in
form
it
signifies
infinitely
more
it
has
distorted
the
western
foot
out
of
the
original
shape
and
rendered
it
incapable
of
the
work
for
which
it
was
evolved
the
physical
results
are
not
limited
to
the
foot
whatever
acts
as
a
check
directly
or
indirectly
upon
the
organs
of
locomotion
must
extend
its
effects
to
the
whole
physical
constitution
does
the
evil
stop
even
there
perhaps
we
submit
to
conventions
the
most
absurd
of
any
existing
in
any
civilization
because
we
have
too
long
submitted
to
the
tyranny
of
shoemakers
there
may
be
defects
in
our
politics
in
our
social
ethics
in
our
religious
system
more
or
less
related
to
the
habit
of
wearing
leather
shoes
submission
to
the
cramping
of
the
body
must
certainly
aid
in
developing
submission
to
the
cramping
of
the
mind
the
japanese
man
of
the
people
the
skilled
laborer
able
to
underbid
without
effort
any
western
artisan
in
the
same
line
of
industry
remains
happily
independent
of
both
shoemakers
and
tailors
his
feet
are
good
to
look
at
his
body
is
healthy
and
his
heart
is
free
if
he
desire
to
travel
a
thousand
miles
he
can
get
ready
for
his
journey
in
five
minutes
his
whole
outfit
need
not
cost
cents
and
all
his
baggage
can
be
put
into
a
handkerchief
on
ten
dollars
he
can
travel
for
a
year
without
work
or
he
can
travel
simply
on
his
ability
to
work
or
he
can
travel
as
a
pilgrim
you
may
reply
that
any
savage
can
do
the
same
thing
yes
but
any
civilized
man
can
not
and
the
japanese
has
been
a
highly
civilized
man
for
at
least
a
thousand
years
hence
his
present
capacity
to
threaten
western
manufacturers
we
have
been
too
much
accustomed
to
associate
this
kind
of
independent
mobility
with
the
life
of
our
own
beggars
and
tramps
to
have
any
just
conception
of
its
intrinsic
meaning
we
have
thought
of
it
also
in
connection
with
unpleasant
things
uncleanliness
and
bad
smells
but
as
professor
chamberlain
has
well
said
a
japanese
crowd
is
the
sweetest
in
the
world
your
japanese
tramp
takes
his
hot
bath
daily
if
he
has
a
fraction
of
a
cent
to
pay
for
it
or
his
cold
bath
if
he
has
not
in
his
little
bundle
there
are
combs
toothpicks
razors
toothbrushes
he
never
allows
himself
to
become
unpleasant
reaching
his
destination
he
can
transform
himself
into
a
visitor
of
very
nice
manners
and
faultless
though
simple
attire
ability
to
live
without
furniture
without
impedimenta
with
the
least
possible
amount
of
neat
clothing
shows
more
than
the
advantage
held
by
this
japanese
race
in
the
struggle
of
life
it
shows
also
the
real
character
of
some
weaknesses
in
our
own
civilization
it
forces
reflection
upon
the
useless
multiplicity
of
our
daily
wants
we
must
have
meat
and
bread
and
butter
glass
windows
and
fire
hats
white
shirts
and
woolen
underwear
boots
and
shoes
trunks
bags
and
boxes
bedsteads
mattresses
sheets
and
blankets
all
of
which
a
japanese
can
do
without
and
is
really
better
off
without
think
for
a
moment
how
important
an
article
of
occidental
attire
is
the
single
costly
item
of
white
shirts
yet
even
the
linen
shirt
the
badge
of
a
gentleman
is
in
itself
a
useless
garment
it
gives
neither
warmth
nor
comfort
it
represents
in
our
fashions
the
survival
of
something
once
a
luxurious
class
distinction
but
meaningless
and
useless
as
the
buttons
sewn
on
the
outside
of
critics
have
tried
to
make
fun
of
sir
edwin
remark
that
a
japanese
crowd
smells
like
a
yet
the
simile
is
exact
the
perfume
called
jako
when
sparingly
used
might
easily
be
taken
for
the
odor
of
a
in
almost
any
japanese
assembly
including
women
a
slight
perfume
of
jako
is
discernible
for
the
robes
worn
have
been
laid
in
drawers
containing
a
few
grains
of
jako
except
for
this
delicate
scent
a
japanese
crowd
is
absolutely
odorless
v
the
absence
of
any
huge
signs
of
the
really
huge
things
that
japan
has
done
bears
witness
to
the
very
peculiar
way
in
which
her
civilization
has
been
working
it
can
not
forever
so
work
but
it
has
so
worked
thus
far
with
amazing
success
japan
is
producing
without
capital
in
our
large
sense
of
the
word
she
has
become
industrial
without
becoming
essentially
mechanical
and
artificial
the
vast
rice
crop
is
raised
upon
millions
of
tiny
tiny
farms
the
silk
crop
in
millions
of
small
poor
homes
the
tea
crop
on
countless
little
patches
of
soil
if
you
visit
kyoto
to
order
something
from
one
of
the
greatest
porcelain
makers
in
the
world
one
whose
products
are
known
better
in
london
and
in
paris
than
even
in
japan
you
will
find
the
factory
to
be
a
wooden
cottage
in
which
no
american
farmer
would
live
the
greatest
maker
of
cloisonne
vases
who
may
ask
you
two
hundred
dollars
for
something
five
inches
high
produces
his
miracles
behind
a
frame
dwelling
containing
perhaps
six
small
rooms
the
best
girdles
of
silk
made
in
japan
and
famous
throughout
the
empire
are
woven
in
a
house
that
cost
scarcely
five
hundred
dollars
to
build
the
work
is
of
course
but
the
factories
weaving
by
machinery
and
weaving
so
well
as
to
ruin
foreign
industries
of
far
vaster
capacity
are
hardly
more
imposing
with
very
few
exceptions
long
light
low
or
sheds
they
are
about
as
costly
to
erect
as
a
row
of
wooden
stables
with
us
yet
sheds
like
these
turn
out
silks
that
sell
all
round
the
world
sometimes
only
by
inquiry
or
by
the
humming
of
the
machinery
can
you
distinguish
a
factory
from
an
old
yashiki
or
an
japanese
school
building
unless
indeed
you
can
read
the
chinese
characters
over
the
garden
gate
some
big
brick
factories
and
breweries
exist
but
they
are
very
few
and
even
when
close
to
the
foreign
settlements
they
seem
incongruities
in
the
landscape
our
own
architectural
monstrosities
and
our
babels
of
machinery
have
been
brought
into
existence
by
vast
integrations
of
industrial
capital
but
such
integrations
do
not
exist
in
the
far
east
indeed
the
capital
to
make
them
does
not
exist
and
supposing
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
generations
there
should
form
in
japan
corresponding
combinations
of
money
power
it
is
not
easy
to
suppose
correspondences
in
architectural
construction
even
edifices
of
brick
have
given
bad
results
in
the
leading
commercial
centre
and
earthquakes
seem
to
condemn
japan
to
perpetual
simplicity
in
building
the
very
land
revolts
against
the
imposition
of
western
architecture
and
occasionally
even
opposes
the
new
course
of
traffic
by
pushing
railroad
lines
out
of
level
and
out
of
shape
not
industry
alone
still
remains
thus
unintegrated
government
itself
exhibits
a
like
condition
nothing
is
fixed
except
the
throne
perpetual
change
is
identical
with
state
policy
ministers
governors
superintendents
inspectors
all
high
civil
and
military
officials
are
shifted
at
irregular
and
surprisingly
short
intervals
and
hosts
of
smaller
officials
scatter
each
time
with
the
whirl
the
province
in
which
i
passed
the
first
twelvemonth
of
my
residence
in
japan
has
had
four
different
governors
in
five
years
during
my
stay
at
kumamoto
and
before
the
war
had
begun
the
military
command
of
that
important
post
was
three
times
changed
the
government
college
had
in
three
years
three
directors
in
educational
circles
especially
the
rapidity
of
such
changes
has
been
phenomenal
there
have
been
five
different
ministers
of
education
in
my
own
time
and
more
than
five
different
educational
policies
the
thousand
public
schools
are
so
related
in
their
management
to
the
local
assemblies
that
even
were
no
other
influences
at
work
constant
change
would
be
inevitable
because
of
the
changes
in
the
assemblies
directors
and
teachers
keep
circling
from
post
to
post
there
are
men
little
more
than
thirty
years
old
who
have
taught
in
almost
every
province
of
the
country
that
any
educational
system
could
have
produced
any
great
results
under
these
conditions
seems
nothing
short
of
miraculous
we
are
accustomed
to
think
that
some
degree
of
stability
is
necessary
to
all
real
progress
all
great
development
but
japan
has
given
proof
irrefutable
that
enormous
development
is
possible
without
any
stability
at
all
the
explanation
is
in
the
race
character
a
race
character
in
more
ways
than
one
the
very
opposite
of
our
own
uniformly
mobile
and
thus
uniformly
impressionable
the
nation
has
moved
unitedly
in
the
direction
of
great
ends
submitting
the
whole
volume
of
its
forty
millions
to
be
moulded
by
the
ideas
of
its
rulers
even
as
sand
or
as
water
is
shaped
by
wind
and
this
submissiveness
to
reshaping
belongs
to
the
old
conditions
of
its
soul
life
old
conditions
of
rare
unselfishness
and
perfect
faith
the
relative
absence
from
the
national
character
of
egotistical
individualism
has
been
the
saving
of
an
empire
has
enabled
a
great
people
to
preserve
its
independence
against
prodigious
odds
wherefore
japan
may
well
be
grateful
to
her
two
great
religions
the
creators
and
the
preservers
of
her
moral
power
to
shinto
which
taught
the
individual
to
think
of
his
emperor
and
of
his
country
before
thinking
either
of
his
own
family
or
of
himself
and
to
buddhism
which
trained
him
to
master
regret
to
endure
pain
and
to
accept
as
eternal
law
the
vanishing
of
things
loved
and
the
tyranny
of
things
hated
there
is
visible
a
tendency
to
hardening
a
danger
of
changes
leading
to
the
integration
of
just
such
an
officialism
as
that
which
has
proved
the
curse
and
the
weakness
of
china
the
moral
results
of
the
new
education
have
not
been
worthy
of
the
material
results
the
charge
of
want
of
individuality
in
the
accepted
sense
of
pure
selfishness
will
scarcely
be
made
against
the
japanese
of
the
next
century
even
the
compositions
of
students
already
reflect
the
new
conception
of
intellectual
strength
only
as
a
weapon
of
offense
and
the
new
sentiment
of
aggressive
egotism
impermanency
writes
one
with
a
fading
memory
of
buddhism
in
his
mind
is
the
nature
of
our
life
we
see
often
persons
who
were
rich
yesterday
and
are
poor
this
is
the
result
of
human
competition
according
to
the
law
of
evolution
we
are
exposed
to
that
competition
we
must
fight
each
other
even
if
we
are
not
inclined
to
do
so
with
what
sword
shall
we
fight
with
the
sword
of
knowledge
forged
by
education
well
there
are
two
forms
of
the
cultivation
of
self
one
leads
to
the
exceptional
development
of
the
qualities
which
are
noble
and
the
other
signifies
something
about
which
the
less
said
the
better
but
it
is
not
the
former
which
the
new
japan
is
now
beginning
to
study
i
confess
to
being
one
of
those
who
believe
that
the
human
heart
even
in
the
history
of
a
race
may
be
worth
infinitely
more
than
the
human
intellect
and
that
it
will
sooner
or
later
prove
itself
infinitely
better
able
to
answer
all
the
cruel
enigmas
of
the
sphinx
of
life
i
still
believe
that
the
old
japanese
were
nearer
to
the
solution
of
those
enigmas
than
are
we
just
because
they
recognized
moral
beauty
as
greater
than
intellectual
beauty
and
by
way
of
conclusion
i
may
venture
to
quote
from
an
article
on
education
by
ferdinand
brunetiere
all
our
educational
measures
will
prove
vain
if
there
be
no
effort
to
force
into
the
mind
and
to
deeply
impress
upon
it
the
sense
of
those
fine
words
of
lamennais
society
is
based
upon
mutual
giving
or
upon
the
sacrifice
of
man
for
man
or
of
each
man
for
all
other
men
and
sacrifice
is
the
very
essence
of
all
true
it
is
this
that
we
have
been
unlearning
for
nearly
a
century
and
if
we
have
to
put
ourselves
to
school
afresh
it
will
be
in
order
that
we
may
learn
it
again
without
such
knowledge
there
can
be
no
society
and
no
education
not
at
least
if
the
object
of
education
be
to
form
man
for
society
individualism
is
the
enemy
of
education
as
it
is
also
the
enemy
of
social
order
it
has
not
been
so
always
but
it
has
so
become
it
will
not
be
so
forever
but
it
is
so
now
and
without
striving
to
destroy
would
mean
to
fall
from
one
extreme
into
another
we
must
recognize
that
no
matter
what
we
wish
to
do
for
the
family
for
society
for
education
and
for
the
country
it
is
against
individualism
that
the
work
will
have
to
be
done
iii
a
street
singer
a
woman
carrying
a
samisen
and
accompanied
by
a
little
boy
seven
or
eight
years
old
came
to
my
house
to
sing
she
wore
the
dress
of
a
peasant
and
a
blue
towel
tied
round
her
head
she
was
ugly
and
her
natural
ugliness
had
been
increased
by
a
cruel
attack
of
smallpox
the
child
carried
a
bundle
of
printed
ballads
neighbors
then
began
to
crowd
into
my
front
yard
mostly
young
mothers
and
nurse
girls
with
babies
on
their
backs
but
old
women
and
men
likewise
the
inkyo
of
the
vicinity
also
the
came
from
their
stand
at
the
next
and
presently
there
was
no
more
room
within
the
gate
the
woman
sat
down
on
my
doorstep
tuned
her
samisen
played
a
bar
of
accompaniment
and
a
spell
descended
upon
the
people
and
they
stared
at
each
other
in
smiling
amazement
for
out
of
those
ugly
disfigured
lips
there
gushed
and
rippled
a
miracle
of
a
voice
young
deep
unutterably
touching
in
its
penetrating
sweetness
woman
or
queried
a
bystander
woman
only
but
a
very
very
great
artist
the
way
she
handled
her
instrument
might
have
astounded
the
most
skillful
geisha
but
no
such
voice
had
ever
been
heard
from
any
geisha
and
no
such
song
she
sang
as
only
a
peasant
can
sing
with
vocal
rhythms
learned
perhaps
from
the
cicada
and
the
wild
nightingales
and
with
fractions
and
and
of
tones
never
written
down
in
the
musical
language
of
the
west
and
as
she
sang
those
who
listened
began
to
weep
silently
i
did
not
distinguish
the
words
but
i
felt
the
sorrow
and
the
sweetness
and
the
patience
of
the
life
of
japan
pass
with
her
voice
into
my
heart
plaintively
seeking
for
something
never
there
a
tenderness
invisible
seemed
to
gather
and
quiver
about
us
and
sensations
of
places
and
of
times
forgotten
came
softly
back
mingled
with
feelings
ghostlier
feelings
not
of
any
place
or
time
in
living
memory
then
i
saw
that
the
singer
was
blind
when
the
song
was
finished
we
coaxed
the
woman
into
the
house
and
questioned
her
once
she
had
been
fairly
well
to
do
and
had
learned
the
samisen
when
a
girl
the
little
boy
was
her
son
her
husband
was
paralyzed
her
eyes
had
been
destroyed
by
smallpox
but
she
was
strong
and
able
to
walk
great
distances
when
the
child
became
tired
she
would
carry
him
on
her
back
she
could
support
the
little
one
as
well
as
the
husband
because
whenever
she
sang
the
people
cried
and
gave
her
coppers
and
food
such
was
her
story
we
gave
her
some
money
and
a
meal
and
she
went
away
guided
by
her
boy
i
bought
a
copy
of
the
ballad
which
was
about
a
recent
double
suicide
sorrowful
ditty
of
tamayone
and
takejiro
composed
by
tabenaka
yone
of
number
fourteen
of
the
fourth
ward
of
in
the
south
district
of
the
city
of
it
had
evidently
been
printed
from
a
wooden
block
and
there
were
two
little
pictures
one
showed
a
girl
and
boy
sorrowing
together
the
other
a
sort
of
represented
a
a
dying
lamp
an
open
letter
incense
burning
in
a
cup
and
a
vase
containing
shikimi
that
sacred
plant
used
in
the
buddhist
ceremony
of
making
offerings
to
the
dead
the
queer
cursive
text
looking
like
shorthand
written
perpendicularly
yielded
to
translation
only
lines
like
these
in
the
first
ward
of
in
osaka
the
sorrow
of
this
tale
of
shinju
tamayone
aged
nineteen
to
see
her
was
to
love
her
for
takejiro
the
young
workman
for
the
time
of
two
lives
they
exchange
mutual
vows
the
sorrow
of
loving
a
courtesan
on
their
arms
they
tattoo
a
raindragon
and
the
character
thinking
never
of
the
troubles
of
life
but
he
can
not
pay
the
yen
for
her
freedom
the
anguish
of
takejiro
heart
both
then
vow
to
pass
away
together
since
never
in
this
world
can
they
become
husband
and
wife
trusting
to
her
comrades
for
incense
and
for
flowers
the
pity
of
their
passing
like
the
dew
tamayone
takes
the
filled
with
water
only
in
which
those
about
to
die
pledge
each
other
the
tumult
of
the
lovers
suicide
o
the
pity
of
their
lives
thrown
away
in
short
there
was
nothing
very
unusual
in
the
story
and
nothing
at
all
remarkable
in
the
verse
all
the
wonder
of
the
performance
had
been
in
the
voice
of
the
woman
but
long
after
the
singer
had
gone
that
voice
seemed
still
to
stay
making
within
me
a
sense
of
sweetness
and
of
sadness
so
strange
that
i
could
not
but
try
to
explain
to
myself
the
secret
of
those
magical
tones
and
i
thought
that
which
is
hereafter
set
down
all
song
all
melody
all
music
means
only
some
evolution
of
the
primitive
natural
utterance
of
feeling
of
that
untaught
speech
of
sorrow
joy
or
passion
whose
words
are
tones
even
as
other
tongues
vary
so
varies
this
language
of
tone
combinations
wherefore
melodies
which
move
us
deeply
have
no
significance
to
japanese
ears
and
melodies
that
touch
us
not
at
all
make
powerful
appeal
to
the
emotion
of
a
race
whose
differs
from
our
own
as
blue
differs
from
yellow
what
is
the
reason
of
the
deeper
feelings
evoked
in
me
an
alien
by
this
oriental
chant
that
i
could
never
even
learn
by
this
common
song
of
a
blind
woman
of
the
people
surely
that
in
the
voice
of
the
singer
there
were
qualities
able
to
make
appeal
to
something
larger
than
the
sum
of
the
experience
of
one
race
to
something
wide
as
human
life
and
ancient
as
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
one
summer
evening
years
ago
in
a
london
park
i
heard
a
girl
say
to
somebody
passing
by
nothing
but
those
two
little
words
who
she
was
i
do
not
know
i
never
even
saw
her
face
and
i
never
heard
that
voice
again
but
still
after
the
passing
of
one
hundred
seasons
the
memory
of
her
brings
a
double
thrill
incomprehensible
of
pleasure
and
pain
pain
and
pleasure
doubtless
not
of
me
not
of
my
own
existence
but
of
and
dead
suns
for
that
which
makes
the
charm
of
a
voice
thus
heard
but
once
can
not
be
of
this
life
it
is
of
lives
innumerable
and
forgotten
certainly
there
never
have
been
two
voices
having
precisely
the
same
quality
but
in
the
utterance
of
affection
there
is
a
tenderness
of
timbre
common
to
the
myriad
million
voices
of
all
humanity
inherited
memory
makes
familiar
to
even
the
the
meaning
of
tins
tone
of
caress
inherited
no
doubt
likewise
our
knowledge
of
the
tones
of
sympathy
of
grief
of
pity
and
so
the
chant
of
a
blind
woman
in
this
city
of
the
far
east
may
revive
in
even
a
western
mind
emotion
deeper
than
individual
being
vague
dumb
pathos
of
forgotten
sorrows
dim
loving
impulses
of
generations
unremembered
the
dead
die
never
utterly
they
sleep
in
the
darkest
cells
of
tired
hearts
and
busy
brains
to
be
startled
at
rarest
moments
only
by
the
echo
of
some
voice
that
recalls
their
past
iv
from
a
traveling
diary
i
railway
april
feeling
drowsy
in
a
public
conveyance
and
not
being
able
to
lie
down
a
japanese
woman
will
lift
her
long
sleeve
before
her
face
era
she
begins
to
nod
in
this
there
are
now
three
women
asleep
in
a
row
all
with
faces
screened
by
the
left
sleeve
and
all
swaying
together
with
the
rocking
of
the
train
like
in
a
soft
current
this
use
of
the
left
sleeve
is
either
fortuitous
or
instinctive
probably
instinctive
as
the
right
hand
serves
best
to
cling
to
strap
or
seat
in
case
of
shock
the
spectacle
is
at
once
pretty
and
funny
but
especially
pretty
as
exemplifying
that
grace
with
which
a
refined
japanese
woman
does
everything
always
in
the
daintiest
and
least
selfish
way
possible
it
is
pathetic
too
for
the
attitude
is
also
that
of
sorrow
and
sometimes
of
weary
prayer
all
because
of
the
trained
sense
of
duty
to
show
only
one
happiest
face
to
the
world
which
fact
reminds
me
of
an
experience
a
male
servant
long
in
my
house
seemed
to
me
the
happiest
of
mortals
he
laughed
invariably
when
spoken
to
looked
always
delighted
while
at
work
appeared
to
know
nothing
of
the
small
troubles
of
life
but
one
day
i
peeped
at
him
when
he
thought
himself
quite
alone
and
his
relaxed
face
startled
me
it
was
not
the
face
i
had
known
hard
lines
of
pain
and
anger
appeared
in
it
making
it
seem
twenty
years
older
i
coughed
gently
to
announce
my
presence
at
once
the
face
smoothed
softened
lighted
up
as
by
a
miracle
of
rejuvenation
miracle
indeed
of
perpetual
unselfish
ii
kyoto
april
the
wooden
shutters
before
my
little
room
in
the
hotel
are
pushed
away
and
the
morning
sun
immediately
paints
upon
my
shoji
across
squares
of
gold
light
the
perfect
sharp
shadow
of
a
little
no
mortal
artist
not
even
a
japanese
could
surpass
that
silhouette
limned
in
dark
blue
against
the
yellow
glow
the
marvelous
image
even
shows
stronger
or
fainter
tones
according
to
the
varying
distance
of
the
unseen
branches
outside
it
sets
me
thinking
about
the
possible
influence
on
japanese
art
of
the
use
of
paper
for
purposes
by
night
a
japanese
house
with
only
its
shoji
closed
looks
like
a
great
lantern
a
making
moving
shadows
within
instead
of
without
itself
by
day
the
shadows
on
the
shoji
are
from
outside
only
but
they
may
be
very
wonderful
at
the
first
rising
of
the
sun
if
his
beams
are
leveled
as
in
this
instance
across
a
space
of
quaint
garden
there
is
certainly
nothing
absurd
in
that
old
greek
story
which
finds
the
origin
of
art
in
the
first
untaught
attempt
to
trace
upon
some
wall
the
outline
of
a
lover
shadow
very
possibly
all
sense
of
art
as
well
as
all
sense
of
the
supernatural
had
its
simple
beginnings
in
the
study
of
shadows
but
shadows
on
shoji
are
so
remarkable
as
to
suggest
explanation
of
certain
japanese
faculties
of
drawing
by
no
means
primitive
but
developed
beyond
all
parallel
and
otherwise
difficult
to
account
for
of
course
the
quality
of
japanese
paper
which
takes
shadows
better
than
any
frosted
glass
must
be
considered
and
also
the
character
of
the
shadows
themselves
western
vegetation
for
example
could
scarcely
furnish
silhouettes
so
gracious
as
those
of
japanese
all
trained
by
centuries
of
caressing
care
to
look
as
lovely
as
nature
allows
i
wish
the
paper
of
my
shoji
could
have
been
like
a
photographic
plate
sensitive
to
that
first
delicious
impression
cast
by
a
level
sun
i
am
already
regretting
distortions
the
beautiful
silhouette
has
begun
to
lengthen
iii
kyoto
april
of
all
peculiarly
beautiful
things
in
japan
the
most
beautiful
are
the
approaches
to
high
places
of
worship
or
of
rest
the
ways
that
go
to
nowhere
and
the
steps
that
lead
to
nothing
certainly
their
special
charm
is
the
charm
of
the
adventitious
the
effect
of
man
handiwork
in
union
with
nature
finest
moods
of
light
and
form
and
color
a
charm
which
vanishes
on
rainy
days
but
it
is
none
the
less
wonderful
because
fitful
perhaps
the
ascent
begins
with
a
sloping
paved
avenue
half
a
mile
long
lined
with
giant
trees
stone
monsters
guard
the
way
at
regular
intervals
then
you
come
to
some
great
flight
of
steps
ascending
through
green
gloom
to
a
terrace
umbraged
by
older
and
vaster
trees
and
other
steps
from
thence
lead
to
other
terraces
all
in
shadow
and
you
climb
and
climb
and
climb
till
at
last
beyond
a
gray
torii
the
goal
appears
a
small
void
colorless
wooden
shrine
a
shinto
miya
the
shock
of
emptiness
thus
received
in
the
high
silence
and
the
shadows
after
all
the
sublimity
of
the
long
approach
is
very
ghostliness
itself
of
similar
buddhist
experiences
whole
multitudes
wait
for
those
who
care
to
seek
them
i
might
suggest
for
example
a
visit
to
the
grounds
of
higashi
otani
which
are
in
the
city
of
kyoto
a
grand
avenue
leads
to
the
court
of
a
temple
and
from
the
court
a
flight
of
steps
fully
fifty
feet
wide
massy
mossed
and
magnificently
balustraded
leads
to
a
walled
terrace
the
scene
makes
one
think
of
the
approach
to
some
italian
of
decameron
days
but
reaching
the
terrace
you
find
only
a
gate
opening
into
a
cemetery
did
the
buddhist
wish
to
tell
us
that
all
pomp
and
power
and
beauty
lead
only
to
such
silence
at
last
iv
kyoto
april
i
have
passed
the
greater
part
of
three
days
in
the
national
exhibition
time
barely
sufficient
to
discern
the
general
character
and
significance
of
the
display
it
is
essentially
industrial
but
nearly
all
delightful
notwithstanding
because
of
the
wondrous
application
of
art
to
all
varieties
of
production
foreign
merchants
and
keener
observers
than
i
find
in
it
other
and
sinister
meaning
the
most
formidable
menace
to
occidental
trade
and
industry
ever
made
by
the
orient
compared
with
england
wrote
a
correspondent
of
the
london
times
it
is
farthings
for
pennies
throughout
the
story
of
the
japanese
invasion
of
lancashire
is
older
than
that
of
the
invasion
of
korea
and
china
it
has
been
a
conquest
of
peace
a
painless
process
of
depletion
which
is
virtually
achieved
the
kyoto
display
is
proof
of
a
further
immense
development
of
industrial
enterprise
a
country
where
laborers
hire
is
three
shillings
a
week
with
all
other
domestic
charges
in
proportion
must
other
things
being
equal
kill
competitors
whose
expenses
are
quadruple
the
japanese
scale
certainly
the
industrial
jiujutsu
promises
unexpected
results
the
price
of
admission
to
the
exhibition
is
a
significant
matter
also
only
five
sen
yet
even
at
this
figure
an
immense
sum
is
likely
to
be
realized
so
great
is
the
swarm
of
visitors
multitudes
of
peasants
are
pouring
daily
into
the
city
pedestrians
mostly
just
as
for
a
pilgrimage
and
a
pilgrimage
for
myriads
the
journey
really
is
because
of
the
inauguration
festival
of
the
greatest
of
shinshu
temples
the
art
department
proper
i
thought
much
inferior
to
that
of
the
tokyo
exhibition
of
fine
things
there
were
but
few
evidence
perhaps
of
the
eagerness
with
which
the
nation
is
turning
all
its
energies
and
talents
in
directions
where
money
is
to
be
made
for
in
those
larger
departments
where
art
is
combined
with
industry
such
as
ceramics
enamels
inlaid
work
embroideries
no
finer
and
costlier
work
could
ever
have
been
shown
indeed
the
high
value
of
certain
articles
on
display
suggested
a
reply
to
a
japanese
friend
who
observed
thoughtfully
if
china
adopts
western
industrial
methods
she
will
be
able
to
underbid
us
in
all
the
markets
of
the
world
perhaps
in
cheap
production
i
made
answer
but
there
is
no
reason
why
japan
should
depend
wholly
upon
cheapness
of
production
i
think
she
may
rely
more
securely
upon
her
superiority
in
art
and
good
taste
the
of
a
people
may
have
a
special
value
against
which
all
competition
by
cheap
labor
is
vain
among
western
nations
france
offers
an
example
her
wealth
is
not
due
to
her
ability
to
underbid
her
neighbors
her
goods
are
the
dearest
in
the
world
she
deals
in
things
of
luxury
and
beauty
but
they
sell
in
all
civilized
countries
because
they
are
the
best
of
their
kind
why
should
not
japan
become
the
france
of
the
further
east
the
weakest
part
of
the
art
display
is
that
devoted
to
in
the
european
manner
no
reason
exists
why
the
japanese
should
not
be
able
to
paint
wonderfully
in
oil
by
following
their
own
particular
methods
of
artistic
expression
but
their
attempts
to
follow
western
methods
have
even
risen
to
mediocrity
only
in
studies
requiring
very
realistic
treatment
ideal
work
in
oil
according
to
western
canons
of
art
is
still
out
of
their
reach
perhaps
they
may
yet
discover
for
themselves
a
new
gateway
to
the
beautiful
even
through
by
adaptation
of
the
method
to
the
particular
needs
of
the
but
there
is
yet
no
sign
of
such
a
tendency
a
canvas
representing
a
perfectly
naked
woman
looking
at
herself
in
a
very
large
mirror
created
a
disagreeable
impression
the
japanese
press
had
been
requesting
the
removal
of
the
piece
and
uttering
comments
not
flattering
to
western
art
ideas
nevertheless
the
canvas
was
by
a
japanese
painter
it
was
a
daub
but
it
had
been
boldly
priced
at
three
thousand
dollars
i
stood
near
the
painting
for
a
while
to
observe
its
effect
upon
the
people
peasants
by
a
huge
majority
they
would
stare
at
it
laugh
scornfully
utter
some
contemptuous
phrase
and
turn
away
to
examine
the
kakemono
which
were
really
far
more
worthy
of
notice
though
offered
at
prices
ranging
only
from
ten
to
fifty
yen
the
comments
were
chiefly
leveled
at
foreign
ideas
of
good
taste
the
figure
having
been
painted
with
a
european
head
none
seemed
to
consider
the
thing
as
a
japanese
work
had
it
represented
a
japanese
woman
i
doubt
whether
the
crowd
would
have
even
tolerated
its
existence
now
all
this
scorn
for
the
picture
itself
was
just
there
was
nothing
ideal
in
the
work
it
was
simply
the
representation
of
a
naked
woman
doing
what
no
woman
could
like
to
be
seen
doing
and
a
picture
of
a
mere
naked
woman
however
well
executed
is
never
art
if
art
means
idealism
the
realism
of
the
thing
was
its
offensiveness
ideal
nakedness
may
be
divine
the
most
godly
of
all
human
dreams
of
the
superhuman
but
a
naked
person
is
not
divine
at
all
ideal
nudity
needs
no
girdle
because
the
charm
is
of
lines
too
beautiful
to
be
veiled
or
broken
the
living
real
human
body
has
no
such
divine
geometry
question
is
an
artist
justified
in
creating
nakedness
for
its
own
sake
unless
he
can
divest
that
nakedness
of
every
trace
of
the
real
and
personal
there
is
a
buddhist
text
which
truly
declares
that
he
alone
is
wise
who
can
see
things
without
their
individuality
and
it
is
this
buddhist
way
of
seeing
which
makes
the
greatness
of
the
true
japanese
art
v
these
thoughts
came
that
nudity
which
is
divine
which
is
the
abstract
of
beauty
absolute
gives
to
the
beholder
a
shock
of
astonishment
and
delight
not
unmixed
with
melancholy
very
few
works
of
art
give
this
because
very
few
approach
perfection
but
there
are
marbles
and
gems
which
give
it
and
certain
fine
studies
of
them
such
as
the
engravings
published
by
the
society
of
dilettanti
the
longer
one
looks
the
more
the
wonder
grows
since
there
appears
no
line
or
part
of
a
line
whose
beauty
does
not
surpass
all
remembrance
so
the
secret
of
such
art
was
long
thought
supernatural
and
in
very
truth
the
sense
of
beauty
it
communicates
is
more
than
human
is
superhuman
in
the
meaning
of
that
which
is
outside
of
existing
life
is
therefore
supernatural
as
any
sensation
known
to
man
can
be
what
is
the
shock
it
resembles
strangely
and
is
certainly
akin
to
that
psychical
shock
which
comes
with
the
first
experience
of
love
plato
explained
the
shock
of
beauty
as
being
the
soul
sudden
of
the
world
of
divine
ideas
they
who
see
here
any
image
or
resemblance
of
the
things
which
are
there
receive
a
shock
like
a
thunderbolt
and
are
after
a
manner
taken
out
of
themselves
schopenhauer
explained
the
shock
of
first
love
as
the
willpower
of
the
soul
of
the
race
the
positive
psychology
of
spencer
declares
in
our
own
day
that
the
most
powerful
of
human
passions
when
it
makes
its
first
appearance
is
absolutely
antecedent
to
all
individual
experience
thus
do
ancient
thought
and
modern
metaphysics
and
science
accord
in
recognizing
that
the
first
deep
sensation
of
human
beauty
known
to
the
individual
is
not
individual
at
all
must
not
the
same
truth
hold
of
that
shock
which
supreme
art
gives
the
human
ideal
expressed
in
such
art
appeals
surely
to
the
experience
of
all
that
past
enshrined
in
the
emotional
life
of
the
beholder
to
something
inherited
from
innumerable
ancestors
innumerable
indeed
allowing
three
generations
to
a
century
and
presupposing
no
consanguineous
marriages
a
french
mathematician
estimates
that
each
existing
individual
of
his
nation
would
have
in
his
veins
the
blood
of
twenty
millions
of
contemporaries
of
the
year
or
calculating
from
the
first
year
of
our
own
era
the
ancestry
of
a
man
of
would
represent
a
total
of
eighteen
quintillions
yet
what
are
twenty
centuries
to
the
time
of
the
life
of
man
well
the
emotion
of
beauty
like
all
of
our
emotions
is
certainly
the
inherited
product
of
unimaginably
countless
experiences
in
an
immeasurable
past
in
every
aesthetic
sensation
is
the
stirring
of
trillions
of
trillions
of
ghostly
memories
buried
in
the
magical
soil
of
the
brain
and
each
man
carries
within
him
an
ideal
of
beauty
which
is
but
an
infinite
composite
of
dead
perceptions
of
form
color
grace
once
dear
to
look
upon
it
is
dormant
this
ideal
potential
in
essence
can
not
be
evoked
at
will
before
the
imagination
but
it
may
light
up
electrically
at
any
perception
by
the
living
outer
senses
of
some
vague
affinity
then
is
felt
that
weird
sad
delicious
thrill
which
accompanies
the
sudden
of
the
tides
of
life
and
time
then
are
the
sensations
of
a
million
years
and
of
myriad
generations
summed
into
the
emotional
feeling
of
a
moment
now
the
artists
of
one
civilization
only
the
greeks
were
able
to
perform
the
miracle
of
disengaging
the
of
beauty
from
their
own
souls
and
fixing
its
wavering
in
jewel
and
stone
nudity
they
made
divine
and
they
still
compel
us
to
feel
its
divinity
almost
as
they
felt
it
themselves
perhaps
they
could
do
this
because
as
emerson
suggested
they
possessed
senses
certainly
it
was
not
because
they
were
as
beautiful
as
their
own
statues
no
man
and
no
woman
could
be
that
this
only
is
sure
that
they
discerned
and
clearly
fixed
their
ideal
composite
of
countless
million
remembrances
of
dead
grace
in
eyes
and
eyelids
throat
and
cheek
mouth
and
chin
body
and
limbs
the
greek
marble
itself
gives
proof
that
there
is
no
absolute
individuality
that
the
mind
is
as
much
a
composite

kyoto
april
the
noblest
examples
of
religious
architecture
in
the
whole
empire
have
just
been
completed
and
the
great
city
of
temples
is
now
enriched
by
two
constructions
probably
never
surpassed
in
all
the
ten
centuries
of
its
existence
one
is
the
gift
of
the
imperial
government
the
other
the
gift
of
the
common
people
the
government
gift
is
the
erected
to
commemorate
the
great
festival
of
kwammu
tenno
emperor
of
japan
and
founder
of
the
sacred
city
to
the
spirit
of
this
emperor
the
is
dedicated
it
is
thus
a
shinto
temple
and
the
most
superb
of
all
shinto
temples
nevertheless
it
is
not
shinto
architecture
but
a
facsimile
of
the
original
palace
of
kwammu
tenno
upon
the
original
scale
the
effect
upon
national
sentiment
of
this
magnificent
deviation
from
conventional
forms
and
the
profound
poetry
of
the
reverential
feeling
which
suggested
it
can
be
fully
comprehended
only
by
those
who
know
that
japan
is
still
practically
ruled
by
the
dead
much
more
than
beautiful
are
the
edifices
of
the
even
in
this
most
archaic
of
japan
cities
they
startle
they
tell
to
the
sky
in
every
tilted
line
of
their
horned
roofs
the
tale
of
another
and
more
fantastic
age
the
most
eccentrically
striking
parts
of
the
whole
are
the
and
gates
veritable
chinese
dreams
one
would
say
in
color
the
construction
is
not
less
oddly
attractive
than
in
form
and
this
especially
because
of
the
fine
use
made
of
antique
green
tiles
in
the
polychromatic
roofing
surely
the
august
spirit
of
kwammu
tenno
might
well
rejoice
in
this
charming
evocation
of
the
past
by
architectural
necromancy
but
the
gift
of
the
people
to
kyoto
is
still
grander
it
is
represented
by
the
glorious
higashi
hongwanji
or
eastern
hongwan
temple
shinshu
western
readers
may
form
some
idea
of
its
character
from
the
simple
statement
that
it
cost
eight
millions
of
dollars
and
required
seventeen
years
to
build
in
mere
dimension
it
is
largely
exceeded
by
other
japanese
buildings
of
cheaper
construction
but
anybody
familiar
with
the
buddhist
temple
architecture
of
japan
can
readily
perceive
the
difficulty
of
building
a
temple
one
hundred
and
feet
high
one
hundred
and
feet
deep
and
more
than
two
hundred
feet
long
because
of
its
peculiar
form
and
especially
because
of
the
vast
sweeping
lines
of
its
roof
the
hongwanji
looks
even
far
larger
than
it
is
looks
mountainous
but
in
any
country
it
would
be
deemed
a
wonderful
structure
there
are
beams
feet
long
and
four
feet
thick
and
there
are
pillars
nine
feet
in
circumference
one
may
guess
the
character
of
the
interior
decoration
from
the
statement
that
the
mere
painting
of
the
on
the
screens
behind
the
main
altar
cost
ten
thousand
dollars
nearly
all
this
wonderful
work
was
done
with
the
money
contributed
in
coppers
by
peasants
and
yet
there
are
people
who
think
that
buddhism
is
dying
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
peasants
came
to
see
the
grand
inauguration
they
seated
themselves
by
myriads
on
matting
laid
down
by
the
acre
in
the
great
court
i
saw
them
waiting
thus
at
three
in
the
afternoon
the
court
was
a
living
sea
yet
all
that
host
was
to
wait
till
seven
for
the
beginning
of
the
ceremony
without
refreshment
in
the
hot
sun
i
saw
at
one
corner
of
the
court
a
band
of
about
twenty
young
girls
all
in
white
and
wearing
peculiar
white
caps
and
i
asked
who
they
were
a
bystander
replied
as
all
these
people
must
wait
here
many
hours
it
is
to
be
feared
that
some
may
become
ill
therefore
professional
nurses
have
been
stationed
here
to
take
care
of
any
who
may
be
sick
there
are
likewise
stretchers
in
waiting
and
carriers
and
there
are
many
physicians
i
admired
the
patience
and
the
faith
but
those
peasants
might
well
love
the
magnificent
temple
their
own
creation
in
very
truth
both
directly
and
indirectly
for
no
small
part
of
the
actual
labor
of
building
was
done
for
love
only
and
the
mighty
beams
for
the
roof
had
been
hauled
to
kyoto
from
with
cables
made
of
the
hair
of
buddhist
wives
and
daughters
one
such
cable
preserved
in
the
temple
is
more
than
three
hundred
and
sixty
feet
long
and
nearly
three
inches
in
diameter
to
me
the
lesson
of
those
two
magnificent
monuments
of
national
religious
sentiment
suggested
the
certain
future
increase
in
ethical
power
and
value
of
that
sentiment
concomitantly
with
the
increase
of
national
prosperity
temporary
poverty
is
the
real
explanation
of
the
apparent
temporary
decline
of
buddhism
but
an
era
of
great
wealth
is
beginning
some
outward
forms
of
buddhism
must
perish
some
superstitions
of
shinto
must
die
the
vital
truths
and
recognitions
will
expand
strengthen
take
only
deeper
root
in
the
heart
of
the
race
and
potently
prepare
it
for
the
trials
of
that
larger
and
harsher
life
upon
which
it
has
to
enter
vii
kobe
april
i
have
been
visiting
the
exhibition
of
fishes
and
of
fisheries
which
is
at
hyogo
in
a
garden
by
the
sea
is
its
name
which
signifies
the
garden
of
the
pleasure
of
peace
it
is
laid
out
like
a
landscape
garden
of
old
time
and
deserves
its
name
over
its
verge
you
behold
the
great
bay
and
fishermen
in
boats
and
the
white
of
sails
splendid
with
light
and
beyond
all
shutting
out
the
horizon
a
lofty
beautiful
massing
of
peaks
by
distance
i
saw
ponds
of
curious
shapes
filled
with
clear
in
which
fish
of
beautiful
colors
were
swimming
i
went
to
the
aquarium
where
stranger
kinds
of
fishes
swam
behind
glass
fishes
shaped
like
and
fishes
shaped
like
and
fishes
that
seemed
to
turn
themselves
inside
out
and
funny
pretty
fishes
of
that
move
like
waving
fins
i
saw
models
of
all
manner
of
boats
and
nets
and
hooks
and
and
for
i
saw
pictures
of
every
kind
of
fishing
and
both
models
and
pictures
of
men
killing
whales
one
picture
was
terrible
the
death
agony
of
a
whale
caught
in
a
giant
net
and
the
leaping
of
boats
in
a
turmoil
of
red
foam
and
one
naked
man
on
the
monstrous
back
a
single
figure
against
the
sky
striking
with
a
great
steel
and
the
of
blood
responding
to
the
stroke
beside
me
i
heard
a
japanese
father
and
mother
explain
the
picture
to
their
little
boy
and
the
mother
said
when
the
whale
is
going
to
die
it
speaks
it
cries
to
the
lord
buddha
for
help
amida
butsu
i
went
to
another
part
of
the
garden
where
there
were
tame
deer
and
a
golden
bear
in
a
cage
and
peafowl
in
an
aviary
and
an
ape
the
people
fed
the
deer
and
the
bear
with
cakes
and
tried
to
coax
the
peacock
to
open
its
tail
and
grievously
tormented
the
ape
i
sat
down
to
rest
on
the
veranda
of
a
near
the
aviary
and
the
japanese
folk
who
had
been
looking
at
the
picture
of
found
their
way
to
the
same
veranda
and
presently
i
heard
the
little
boy
say
father
there
is
an
old
old
fisherman
in
his
boat
why
does
he
not
go
to
the
palace
of
the
of
the
sea
like
urashima
the
father
answered
urashima
caught
a
turtle
which
was
not
really
a
turtle
but
the
daughter
of
the
so
he
was
rewarded
for
his
kindness
but
that
old
fisherman
has
not
caught
any
turtle
and
even
if
he
had
caught
one
he
is
much
too
old
to
marry
therefore
he
will
not
go
to
the
palace
then
the
boy
looked
at
the
flowers
and
the
fountains
and
the
sunned
sea
with
its
white
sails
and
the
mountains
all
and
exclaimed
father
do
you
think
there
is
any
place
more
beautiful
than
this
in
the
whole
world
the
father
smiled
deliciously
and
seemed
about
to
answer
but
before
he
could
speak
the
child
cried
out
and
leaped
and
clapped
his
little
hands
for
delight
because
the
peacock
had
suddenly
outspread
the
splendor
of
its
tail
and
all
hastened
to
the
aviary
so
i
never
heard
the
reply
to
that
pretty
question
but
afterwards
i
thought
that
it
might
have
been
answered
thus
my
boy
very
beautiful
this
is
but
the
world
is
full
of
beauty
and
there
may
be
gardens
more
beautiful
than
this
but
the
fairest
of
gardens
is
not
in
our
world
it
is
the
garden
of
amida
in
the
paradise
of
the
west
and
whosoever
does
no
wrong
what
time
he
lives
may
after
death
dwell
in
that
garden
there
the
divine
kujaku
bird
of
heaven
sings
of
the
seven
steps
and
the
five
powers
spreading
its
tail
as
a
sun
there
lakes
of
are
and
in
them
of
a
loveliness
for
which
there
is
not
any
name
and
from
those
flowers
proceed
continually
rays
of
and
spirits
of
buddhas
and
the
water
murmuring
among
the
speaks
to
the
souls
in
them
of
infinite
memory
and
infinite
vision
and
of
the
four
infinite
feelings
and
in
that
place
there
is
no
difference
between
gods
and
men
save
that
under
the
splendor
of
amida
even
the
gods
must
bend
and
all
sing
the
hymn
of
praise
beginning
thou
of
immeasurable
light
but
the
voice
of
the
river
celestial
chants
forever
like
the
chanting
of
thousands
in
unison
this
is
not
high
there
is
still
a
higher
this
is
not
real
this
is
not
peace
v
the
nun
of
the
temple
of
amida
when
husband
a
distant
cousin
adopted
into
her
family
for
love
sake
had
been
summoned
by
his
lord
to
the
capital
she
did
not
feel
anxious
about
the
future
she
felt
sad
only
it
was
the
first
time
since
their
bridal
that
they
had
ever
been
separated
but
she
had
her
father
and
mother
to
keep
her
company
and
dearer
than
either
though
she
would
never
have
confessed
it
even
to
herself
her
little
son
besides
she
always
had
plenty
to
do
there
were
many
household
duties
to
perform
and
there
was
much
clothing
to
be
woven
both
silk
and
cotton
once
daily
at
a
fixed
hour
she
would
set
for
the
absent
husband
in
his
favorite
room
little
repasts
faultlessly
served
on
dainty
lacquered
trays
meals
such
as
are
offered
to
the
ghosts
of
the
ancestors
and
to
the
gods
these
repasts
were
served
at
the
east
side
of
the
room
and
his
placed
before
them
the
reason
they
were
served
at
the
east
side
was
because
he
had
gone
east
before
removing
the
food
she
always
lifted
the
cover
of
the
little
to
see
if
there
was
vapor
upon
its
lacquered
inside
surface
for
it
is
said
that
if
there
be
vapor
on
the
inside
of
the
lid
covering
food
so
offered
the
absent
beloved
is
well
but
if
there
be
none
he
is
dead
because
that
is
a
sign
that
his
soul
has
returned
by
itself
to
seek
nourishment
found
the
lacquer
thickly
beaded
with
vapor
day
by
day
the
child
was
her
constant
delight
he
was
three
years
old
and
fond
of
asking
questions
to
which
none
but
the
gods
know
the
real
answers
when
he
wanted
to
play
she
laid
aside
her
work
to
play
with
him
when
he
wanted
to
rest
she
told
him
wonderful
stories
or
gave
pretty
pious
answers
to
his
questions
about
those
things
which
no
man
can
ever
understand
at
evening
when
the
little
lamps
had
been
lighted
before
the
holy
tablets
and
the
images
she
taught
his
lips
to
shape
the
words
of
filial
prayer
when
he
had
been
laid
to
sleep
she
brought
her
work
near
him
and
watched
the
still
sweetness
of
his
face
sometimes
he
would
smile
in
his
dreams
and
she
knew
that
kwannon
the
divine
was
playing
shadowy
play
with
him
and
she
would
murmur
the
buddhist
invocation
to
that
maid
who
looketh
forever
down
above
the
sound
of
prayer
sometimes
in
the
season
of
very
clear
days
she
would
climb
the
mountain
of
dakeyama
carrying
her
little
boy
on
her
back
such
a
trip
delighted
him
much
not
only
because
of
what
his
mother
taught
him
to
see
but
also
of
what
she
taught
him
to
hear
the
sloping
way
was
through
groves
and
woods
and
over
grassed
slopes
and
around
queer
rocks
and
there
were
flowers
with
stories
in
their
hearts
and
trees
holding
pigeons
cried
and
doves
sobbed
owao
owao
and
cicada
wheezed
and
fluted
and
tinkled
all
those
who
wait
for
absent
dear
ones
make
if
they
can
a
pilgrimage
to
the
peak
called
dakeyama
it
is
visible
from
any
part
of
the
city
and
from
its
summit
several
provinces
can
be
seen
at
the
very
top
is
a
stone
of
almost
human
height
and
shape
perpendicularly
set
up
and
little
pebbles
are
heaped
before
it
and
upon
it
and
near
by
there
is
a
small
shinto
shrine
erected
to
the
spirit
of
a
princess
of
other
days
for
she
mourned
the
absence
of
one
she
loved
and
used
to
watch
from
this
mountain
for
his
coming
until
she
pined
away
and
was
changed
into
a
stone
the
people
therefore
built
the
shrine
and
lovers
of
the
absent
still
pray
there
for
the
return
of
those
dear
to
them
and
each
after
so
praying
takes
home
one
of
the
little
pebbles
heaped
there
and
when
the
beloved
one
returns
the
pebble
must
be
taken
back
to
the
upon
the
and
other
pebbles
with
it
for
a
and
commemoration
always
ere
and
her
son
could
reach
their
home
after
such
a
day
the
dusk
would
fall
softly
about
them
for
the
way
was
long
and
they
had
to
both
go
and
return
by
boat
through
the
wilderness
of
round
the
town
which
is
a
slow
manner
of
journeying
sometimes
stars
and
fireflies
lighted
them
sometimes
also
the
moon
and
would
softly
sing
to
her
boy
the
izumo
to
the
moon
little
lady
moon
how
old
are
you
thirteen
days
thirteen
and
nine
that
is
still
young
and
the
reason
must
be
for
that
bright
red
obi
so
nicely
tied
and
that
nice
white
girdle
about
your
hips
will
you
give
it
to
the
horse
oh
no
no
will
you
give
it
to
the
cow
oh
no
no
and
up
to
the
blue
night
would
rise
from
all
those
wet
leagues
of
labored
field
that
great
soft
bubbling
chorus
which
seems
the
very
voice
of
the
soil
itself
the
chant
of
the
frogs

syllables

the
word

is
also
use
to
signify

so
that
time
term
would
be
a
better
translation

then
twice
within
the
time
of
three
days
those
masters
of
life
and
death
whose
ways
belong
to
the
eternal
mysteries
struck
at
her
heart
first
she
was
taught
that
the
gentle
husband
for
whom
she
had
so
often
prayed
never
could
return
to
her
having
been
returned
unto
that
dust
out
of
which
all
forms
are
borrowed
and
in
another
little
while
she
knew
her
boy
slept
so
deep
a
sleep
that
the
chinese
physician
could
not
waken
him
these
things
she
learned
only
as
shapes
are
learned
in
lightning
flashes
between
and
beyond
the
flashes
was
that
absolute
darkness
which
is
the
pity
of
the
gods
it
passed
and
she
rose
to
meet
a
foe
whose
name
is
memory
before
all
others
she
could
keep
her
face
as
in
other
days
sweet
and
smiling
but
when
alone
with
this
visitant
she
found
herself
less
strong
she
would
arrange
little
toys
and
spread
out
little
dresses
on
the
matting
and
look
at
them
and
talk
to
them
in
whispers
and
smile
silently
but
the
smile
would
ever
end
in
a
burst
of
wild
loud
weeping
and
she
would
beat
her
head
upon
the
floor
and
ask
foolish
questions
of
the
gods
one
day
she
thought
of
a
weird
consolation
that
rite
the
people
name
the
evocation
of
the
dead
could
she
not
call
back
her
boy
for
one
brief
minute
only
it
would
trouble
the
little
soul
but
would
he
not
gladly
bear
a
pain
for
her
dear
sake
surely
to
have
the
dead
called
back
one
must
go
to
some
priest
buddhist
or
shinto
who
knows
the
rite
of
incantation
and
the
mortuary
tablet
or
ihai
of
the
dead
must
be
brought
to
that
priest
then
ceremonies
of
purification
are
performed
candles
are
lighted
and
incense
is
kindled
before
the
ihai
and
prayers
or
parts
of
sutras
are
recited
and
offerings
of
flowers
and
of
rice
are
made
but
in
this
case
the
rice
must
not
be
cooked
and
when
everything
has
been
made
ready
the
priest
taking
in
his
left
hand
an
instrument
shaped
like
a
bow
and
striking
it
rapidly
with
his
right
calls
upon
the
name
of
the
dead
and
cries
out
the
words
kitazo
yo
kitazo
yo
kitazo
yo
meaning
i
have
come
and
as
he
cries
the
tone
of
his
voice
gradually
changes
until
it
becomes
the
very
voice
of
the
dead
person
for
the
ghost
enters
into
him
then
the
dead
will
answer
questions
quickly
asked
but
will
cry
continually
hasten
hasten
for
this
my
coming
back
is
painful
and
i
have
but
a
little
time
to
stay
and
having
answered
the
ghost
passes
and
the
priest
falls
senseless
upon
his
face
now
to
call
back
the
dead
is
not
good
for
by
calling
them
back
their
condition
is
made
worse
returning
to
the
underworld
they
must
take
a
place
lower
than
that
which
they
held
before
these
rites
are
not
allowed
by
law
they
once
consoled
but
the
law
is
a
good
law
and
just
since
there
exist
men
willing
to
mock
the
divine
which
is
in
human
hearts
so
it
came
to
pass
that
found
herself
one
night
in
a
lonely
little
temple
at
the
verge
of
the
city
kneeling
before
the
ihai
of
her
boy
and
hearing
the
rite
of
incantation
and
presently
out
of
the
lips
of
the
officiant
there
came
a
voice
she
thought
she
knew
a
voice
loved
above
all
others
but
faint
and
very
thin
like
a
sobbing
of
wind
and
the
thin
voice
cried
to
her
ask
quickly
quickly
mother
dark
is
the
way
and
long
and
i
may
not
linger
then
tremblingly
she
questioned
why
must
i
sorrow
for
my
child
what
is
the
justice
of
the
gods
and
there
was
answer
given
o
mother
do
not
mourn
me
thus
that
i
died
was
only
that
you
might
not
die
for
the
year
was
a
year
of
sickness
and
of
sorrow
and
it
was
given
me
to
know
that
you
were
to
die
and
i
obtained
by
prayer
that
i
should
take
your
place
o
mother
never
weep
for
me
it
is
not
kindness
to
mourn
for
the
dead
over
the
river
of
tears
their
silent
road
is
and
when
mothers
weep
the
flood
of
that
river
rises
and
the
soul
can
not
pass
but
must
wander
to
and
fro
therefore
i
pray
you
do
not
grieve
o
mother
mine
only
give
me
a
little
water
sometimes
whence
the
izumo
saying
about
one
who
too
often
announces
his
coming
thy
talk
is
like
the
talk
of
necromancy
toritsubanashi
no
yona
migawari
substitute
is
the
religious
term
iii
from
that
hour
she
was
not
seen
to
weep
she
performed
lightly
and
silently
as
in
former
days
the
gentle
duties
of
a
daughter
seasons
passed
and
her
father
thought
to
find
another
husband
for
her
to
the
mother
he
said
if
our
daughter
again
have
a
son
it
will
be
great
joy
for
her
and
for
all
of
us
but
the
wiser
mother
made
answer
unhappy
she
is
not
it
is
impossible
that
she
marry
again
she
has
become
as
a
little
child
knowing
nothing
of
trouble
or
sin
it
was
true
that
she
had
ceased
to
know
real
pain
she
had
begun
to
show
a
strange
fondness
for
very
small
things
at
first
she
had
found
her
bed
too
large
perhaps
through
the
sense
of
emptiness
left
by
the
loss
of
her
child
then
day
by
day
other
things
seemed
to
grow
too
large
the
dwelling
itself
the
familiar
rooms
the
alcove
and
its
great
even
the
household
utensils
she
wished
to
eat
her
rice
with
miniature
out
of
a
very
small
bowl
such
as
children
use
in
these
things
she
was
lovingly
humored
and
in
other
matters
she
was
not
fantastic
the
old
people
consulted
together
about
her
constantly
at
last
the
father
said
for
our
daughter
to
live
with
strangers
might
be
painful
but
as
we
are
aged
we
may
soon
have
to
leave
her
perhaps
we
could
provide
for
her
by
making
her
a
nun
we
might
build
a
little
temple
for
her
next
day
the
mother
asked
would
you
not
like
to
become
a
holy
nun
and
to
live
in
a
very
very
small
temple
with
a
very
small
altar
and
little
images
of
the
buddhas
we
should
be
always
near
you
if
you
wish
this
we
shall
get
a
priest
to
teach
you
the
sutras
wished
it
and
asked
that
an
extremely
small
nun
dress
be
got
for
her
but
the
mother
said
everything
except
the
dress
a
good
nun
may
have
made
small
but
she
must
wear
a
large
dress
that
is
the
law
of
buddha
so
she
was
persuaded
to
wear
the
same
dress
as
other
nuns
iv
they
built
for
her
a
small
or
in
an
empty
court
where
another
and
larger
temple
called
had
once
stood
the
was
also
called
and
was
dedicated
to
and
to
other
buddhas
it
was
fitted
up
with
a
very
small
altar
and
with
miniature
altar
furniture
there
was
a
tiny
copy
of
the
sutras
on
a
tiny
and
tiny
screens
and
bells
and
kakemono
and
she
dwelt
there
long
after
her
parents
had
passed
away
people
called
her
the
no
bikuni
which
means
the
nun
of
the
temple
of
amida
a
little
outside
the
gate
there
was
a
statue
of
jizo
this
jizo
was
a
special
jizo
the
friend
of
sick
children
there
were
nearly
always
offerings
of
small
to
be
seen
before
him
these
signified
that
some
sick
child
was
being
prayed
for
and
the
number
of
the
signified
the
number
of
the
years
of
the
child
most
often
there
were
but
two
or
three
cakes
rarely
there
were
seven
or
ten
the
no
bikuni
took
care
of
the
statue
and
supplied
it
with
and
flowers
from
the
temple
garden
for
there
was
a
small
garden
behind
the
after
making
her
morning
round
with
her
she
would
usually
seat
herself
before
a
very
small
loom
to
weave
cloth
much
too
narrow
for
serious
use
but
her
webs
were
bought
always
by
certain
shopkeepers
who
knew
her
story
and
they
made
her
presents
of
very
small
cups
tiny
and
queer
for
her
garden
her
greatest
pleasure
was
the
companionship
of
children
and
this
she
never
lacked
japanese
is
mostly
passed
in
temple
courts
and
many
happy
childhoods
were
spent
in
the
court
of
the
all
the
mothers
in
that
street
liked
to
have
their
little
ones
play
there
but
cautioned
them
never
to
laugh
at
the
sometimes
her
ways
are
strange
they
would
say
but
that
is
because
she
once
had
a
little
son
who
died
and
the
pain
became
too
great
for
her
mother
heart
so
you
must
be
very
good
and
respectful
to
her
good
they
were
but
not
quite
respectful
in
the
reverential
sense
they
knew
better
than
to
be
that
they
called
her
always
and
saluted
her
nicely
but
otherwise
they
treated
her
like
one
of
themselves
they
played
games
with
her
and
she
gave
them
tea
in
extremely
small
cups
and
made
for
them
heaps
of
not
much
bigger
than
peas
and
wove
upon
her
loom
cloth
of
cotton
and
cloth
of
silk
for
the
robes
of
their
dolls
so
she
became
to
them
as
a
they
played
with
her
daily
till
they
grew
too
big
to
play
and
left
the
court
of
the
temple
of
amida
to
begin
the
bitter
work
of
life
and
to
become
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
children
whom
they
sent
to
play
in
their
stead
these
learned
to
love
the
like
their
parents
had
done
and
the
lived
to
play
with
the
children
of
the
children
of
the
children
of
those
who
remembered
when
her
temple
was
built
the
people
took
good
heed
that
she
should
not
know
want
there
was
always
given
to
her
more
than
she
needed
for
herself
so
she
was
able
to
be
nearly
as
kind
to
the
children
as
she
wished
and
to
feed
extravagantly
certain
small
animals
birds
nested
in
her
temple
and
ate
from
her
hand
and
learned
not
to
perch
upon
the
heads
of
the
buddhas
some
days
after
her
funeral
a
crowd
of
children
visited
my
house
a
little
girl
of
nine
years
spoke
for
them
all
sir
we
are
asking
for
the
sake
of
the
who
is
dead
a
very
large
haka
has
been
set
up
for
her
it
is
a
nice
haka
but
we
want
to
give
her
also
a
very
very
small
haka
because
in
the
time
she
was
with
us
she
often
said
that
she
would
like
a
very
little
haka
and
the
has
promised
to
cut
it
for
us
and
to
make
it
very
pretty
if
we
can
bring
the
money
therefore
perhaps
you
will
honorably
give
something
assuredly
i
said
but
now
you
will
have
nowhere
to
play
she
answered
smiling
we
shall
still
play
in
the
court
of
the
temple
of
amida
she
is
buried
there
she
will
hear
our
playing
and
be
glad
tombstone
vi
after
the
war
i
hyogo
may
hyogo
this
morning
lies
bathed
in
a
limpid
magnificence
of
light
indescribable
spring
light
which
is
vapory
and
lends
a
sort
of
apparitional
charm
to
far
things
seen
through
it
forms
remain
sharply
outlined
but
are
almost
idealized
by
faint
colors
not
belonging
to
them
and
the
great
hills
behind
the
town
aspire
into
a
cloudless
splendor
of
tint
that
seems
the
ghost
of
azure
rather
than
azure
itself
over
the
slope
of
tiled
roofs
there
is
a
vast
quivering
and
fluttering
of
extraordinary
shapes
a
spectacle
not
indeed
new
to
me
but
always
delicious
everywhere
are
floating
tied
to
very
tall
bamboo
poles
immense
brightly
colored
paper
fish
which
look
and
move
as
if
alive
the
greater
number
vary
from
five
to
fifteen
feet
in
length
but
here
and
there
i
see
a
baby
scarcely
a
foot
long
hooked
to
the
tail
of
a
larger
one
some
poles
have
four
or
five
fish
attached
to
them
at
heights
proportioned
to
the
dimensions
of
the
fish
the
largest
always
at
the
top
so
cunningly
shaped
and
colored
these
things
are
that
the
first
sight
of
them
is
always
startling
to
a
stranger
the
lines
holding
them
are
fastened
within
the
head
and
the
wind
entering
the
open
mouth
not
only
inflates
the
body
to
perfect
form
but
keeps
it
undulating
rising
and
descending
turning
and
twisting
precisely
like
a
real
fish
while
the
tail
plays
and
the
fins
wave
irreproachably
in
the
garden
of
my
neighbor
there
are
two
very
fine
specimens
one
has
an
orange
belly
and
a
back
the
other
is
all
a
silvery
tint
and
both
have
big
weird
eyes
the
rustling
of
their
motion
as
they
swim
against
the
sky
is
like
the
sound
of
wind
in
a
a
little
farther
off
i
see
another
very
big
fish
with
a
little
red
boy
clinging
to
its
back
that
red
boy
represents
kintoki
strongest
of
all
children
ever
born
in
japan
who
while
still
a
baby
wrestled
with
bears
and
set
traps
for
everybody
knows
that
these
paper
carp
or
koi
are
hoisted
only
during
the
period
of
the
great
birth
festival
of
boys
in
the
fifth
month
that
their
presence
above
a
house
signifies
the
birth
of
a
son
and
that
they
symbolize
the
hope
of
the
parents
that
their
lad
will
be
able
to
win
his
way
through
the
world
against
all
obstacles
even
as
the
real
koi
the
great
japanese
carp
ascends
swift
rivers
against
the
stream
in
many
parts
of
southern
and
western
japan
you
rarely
see
these
koi
you
see
instead
very
long
narrow
flags
of
cotton
cloth
called
nobori
which
are
fastened
perpendicularly
like
sails
with
little
spars
and
rings
to
poles
of
bamboo
and
bear
designs
in
various
colors
of
the
koi
in
an
eddy
or
of
shoki
conqueror
of
demons
or
of
pines
or
of
tortoises
or
other
fortunate
symbols
ii
but
in
this
radiant
spring
of
the
japanese
year
the
koi
might
be
taken
to
symbolize
something
larger
than
parental
hope
the
great
trust
of
a
nation
regenerated
through
war
the
military
revival
of
the
empire
the
real
birthday
of
new
japan
began
with
the
conquest
of
china
the
war
is
ended
the
future
though
clouded
seems
big
with
promise
and
however
grim
the
obstacles
to
loftier
and
more
enduring
achievements
japan
has
neither
fears
nor
doubts
perhaps
the
future
danger
is
just
in
this
immense
it
is
not
a
new
feeling
created
by
victory
it
is
a
race
feeling
which
repeated
triumphs
have
served
only
to
strengthen
from
the
instant
of
the
declaration
of
war
there
was
never
the
least
doubt
of
ultimate
victory
there
was
universal
and
profound
enthusiasm
but
no
outward
signs
of
emotional
excitement
men
at
once
set
to
writing
histories
of
the
triumphs
of
japan
and
these
histories
issued
to
subscribers
in
weekly
or
monthly
parts
and
illustrated
with
or
drawings
on
wood
were
selling
all
over
the
country
long
before
any
foreign
observers
could
have
ventured
to
predict
the
final
results
of
the
campaign
from
first
to
last
the
nation
felt
sure
of
its
own
strength
and
of
the
impotence
of
china
the
put
suddenly
into
the
market
legions
of
ingenious
mechanisms
representing
chinese
soldiers
in
flight
or
being
cut
down
by
japanese
troopers
or
tied
together
as
prisoners
by
their
queues
or
kowtowing
for
mercy
to
illustrious
generals
the
military
playthings
representing
samurai
in
armor
were
superseded
by
figures
in
clay
wood
paper
or
silk
of
japanese
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
by
models
of
forts
and
batteries
and
models
of
the
storming
of
the
defenses
of
port
arthur
by
the
kumamoto
brigade
was
the
subject
of
one
ingenious
mechanical
toy
another
equally
clever
repeated
the
fight
of
the
matsushima
kan
with
the
chinese
there
were
sold
likewise
myriads
of
discharging
corks
by
compressed
air
with
a
loud
pop
and
myriads
of
and
countless
tiny
bugles
the
constant
blowing
of
which
recalled
to
me
the
tumult
of
a
certain
new
year
eve
in
new
orleans
the
announcement
of
each
victory
resulted
in
an
enormous
manufacture
and
sale
of
colored
prints
rudely
and
cheaply
executed
and
mostly
depicting
the
fancy
of
the
artist
only
well
fitted
to
stimulate
the
popular
love
of
glory
wonderful
sets
of
chessmen
also
appeared
each
piece
representing
a
chinese
or
japanese
officer
or
soldier
meanwhile
the
theatres
were
celebrating
the
war
after
a
much
more
complete
fashion
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
almost
every
episode
of
the
campaign
was
repeated
upon
the
stage
actors
even
visited
the
battlefields
to
study
scenes
and
backgrounds
and
fit
themselves
to
portray
realistically
with
the
aid
of
artificial
snowstorms
the
hardships
of
the
army
in
manchuria
every
gallant
deed
was
dramatized
almost
as
soon
as
reported
the
death
of
the
bugler
shirakami
genjiro
the
triumphant
courage
of
harada
jiukichi
who
scaled
a
rampart
and
opened
a
fortress
gate
to
his
comrades
the
heroism
of
the
fourteen
troopers
who
held
their
own
against
three
hundred
infantry
the
successful
charge
of
unarmed
coolies
upon
a
chinese
battalion
all
these
and
many
other
incidents
were
reproduced
in
a
thousand
theatres
immense
illuminations
of
paper
lanterns
lettered
with
phrases
of
loyalty
or
patriotic
cheer
celebrated
the
success
of
the
imperial
arms
or
gladdened
the
eyes
of
soldiers
going
by
train
to
the
field
in
kobe
constantly
traversed
by
such
illuminations
continued
night
after
night
for
weeks
together
and
the
residents
of
each
street
further
subscribed
for
flags
and
triumphal
arches
but
the
glories
of
the
war
were
celebrated
also
in
ways
more
durable
by
the
various
great
industries
of
the
country
victories
and
incidents
of
sacrificial
heroism
were
commemorated
in
porcelain
in
and
in
costly
textures
not
less
than
in
new
designs
for
envelopes
and
they
were
portrayed
on
the
silk
linings
of
haori
on
women
kerchiefs
of
chirimen
in
the
embroidery
of
girdles
in
the
designs
of
silk
shirts
and
of
children
holiday
robes
not
to
speak
of
cheaper
printed
goods
such
as
calicoes
and
toweling
they
were
represented
in
of
many
kinds
on
the
sides
and
covers
of
carven
boxes
on
on
in
designs
for
hairpins
on
women
combs
even
on
chopsticks
bundles
of
toothpicks
in
tiny
cases
were
offered
for
sale
each
toothpick
having
engraved
upon
it
in
microscopic
text
a
different
poem
about
the
war
and
up
to
the
time
of
peace
or
at
least
up
to
the
time
of
the
insane
attempt
by
a
soshi
to
kill
the
chinese
plenipotentiary
during
negotiations
all
things
happened
as
the
people
had
wished
and
expected
but
as
soon
as
the
terms
of
peace
had
been
announced
russia
interfered
securing
the
help
of
france
and
germany
to
bully
japan
the
combination
met
with
no
opposition
the
government
played
jiujutsu
and
foiled
expectations
by
yielding
japan
had
long
ceased
to
feel
uneasy
about
her
own
military
power
her
reserve
strength
is
probably
much
greater
than
has
ever
been
acknowledged
and
her
educational
system
with
its
thousand
schools
is
an
enormous
on
her
own
soil
she
could
face
any
foreign
power
her
navy
was
her
weak
point
and
of
this
she
was
fully
aware
it
was
a
splendid
fleet
of
small
light
cruisers
and
splendidly
handled
its
admiral
without
the
loss
of
a
single
vessel
had
annihilated
the
chinese
fleet
in
two
engagements
but
it
was
not
yet
sufficiently
heavy
to
face
the
combined
navies
of
three
european
powers
and
the
flower
of
the
japanese
army
was
beyond
the
sea
the
most
opportune
moment
for
interference
had
been
cunningly
chosen
and
probably
more
than
interference
was
intended
the
heavy
russian
were
stripped
for
fighting
and
these
alone
could
possibly
have
overpowered
the
japanese
fleet
though
the
victory
would
have
been
a
costly
one
but
russian
action
was
suddenly
checked
by
the
sinister
declaration
of
english
sympathy
for
japan
within
a
few
weeks
england
could
bring
into
asiatic
waters
a
fleet
capable
of
crushing
in
one
short
battle
all
the
assembled
by
the
combination
and
a
single
shot
from
a
russian
cruiser
might
have
plunged
the
whole
world
into
war
but
in
the
japanese
navy
there
was
a
furious
desire
to
battle
with
the
three
hostile
powers
at
once
it
would
have
been
a
great
fight
for
no
japanese
commander
would
have
dreamed
of
yielding
no
japanese
ship
would
have
struck
her
colors
the
army
was
equally
desirous
of
war
it
needed
all
the
firmness
of
the
government
to
hold
the
nation
back
free
speech
was
gagged
the
press
was
severely
silenced
and
by
the
return
to
china
of
the
peninsula
in
exchange
for
a
compensatory
increase
of
the
war
indemnity
previously
exacted
peace
was
secured
the
government
really
acted
with
faultless
wisdom
at
this
period
of
japanese
development
a
costly
war
with
russia
could
not
fail
to
have
consequences
the
most
disastrous
to
industry
commerce
and
finance
but
the
national
pride
has
been
deeply
wounded
and
the
country
can
still
scarcely
forgive
its
rulers
at
the
battle
of
a
japanese
bugler
named
shirakami
genjiro
was
ordered
to
sound
the
charge
suzume
he
had
sounded
it
once
when
a
bullet
passed
through
his
lungs
throwing
him
his
comrades
tried
to
take
the
bugle
away
seeing
the
wound
was
fatal
he
wrested
it
from
them
lifted
it
again
to
his
lips
sounded
the
charge
once
more
with
all
his
strength
and
fell
back
dead
i
venture
to
offer
this
rough
translation
of
a
song
now
sung
about
him
by
every
soldier
and
schoolboy
in
japan
shirakami
genjiro
after
the
japanese
military
ballad

in
other
times
than
this

now
beneath
the
storm
of
shot
its
waters
seethe
and
toss
in
other

to
pass
that
stream
were
sport
for
boys
at
play
but
every
man
through
blood
must
wade
who
fords

the

crash
of
battle
rings
the
bugle
stern
appeal
why
has
that
bugle
ceased
to
call
why
does
it
call
once
more
why
sounds
the
stirring
signal
now
more
faintly
than
before
what
time
the
bugle
ceased
to
sound
the
breast
was
smitten
through
what
time
the
blast
rang
faintly
blood
gushed
from
the
lips
that
blew
still
the
bugler
stands
he
leans
upon
his
gun
once
more
to
sound
the
before
his
life
be
done
what
though
the
shattered
body
fall
the
spirit
rushes
free
through
heaven
and
earth
to
sound
anew
that
call
to
victory
far
far
beyond

shore
the
spot
now
honored
by
his
fall

forty
million
brethren

kan

anchored
before
the
garden
of
the
pleasure
of
peace
she
is
not
a
colossus
though
she
has
done
grand
things
but
she
certainly
looks
quite
formidable
as
she
lies
there
in
the
clear
light
a
fortress
of
steel
rising
out
of
the
smooth
blue
permission
to
visit
her
has
been
given
to
the
delighted
people
who
don
their
best
for
the
occasion
as
for
a
temple
festival
and
i
am
suffered
to
accompany
some
of
them
all
the
boats
in
the
port
would
seem
to
have
been
hired
for
the
visitors
so
huge
is
the
shoal
hovering
about
the
ironclad
as
we
arrive
it
is
not
possible
for
such
a
number
of
sightseers
to
go
on
board
at
once
and
we
have
to
wait
while
hundreds
are
being
alternately
admitted
and
dismissed
but
the
waiting
in
the
cool
sea
air
is
not
unpleasant
and
the
spectacle
of
the
popular
joy
is
worth
watching
what
eager
rushing
when
the
turn
comes
what
swarming
and
squeezing
and
clinging
two
women
fall
into
the
sea
and
are
pulled
out
by
and
say
they
are
not
sorry
to
have
fallen
in
because
they
can
now
boast
of
owing
their
lives
to
the
men
of
the
matsushima
kan
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
could
not
very
well
have
been
drowned
there
were
legions
of
common
boatmen
to
look
after
them
but
something
of
larger
importance
to
the
nation
than
the
lives
of
two
young
women
is
really
owing
to
the
men
of
the
matsushima
kan
and
the
people
are
rightly
trying
to
pay
them
back
with
love
for
presents
such
as
thousands
would
like
to
make
are
prohibited
by
disciplinary
rule
officers
and
crew
must
be
weary
but
the
crowding
and
the
questioning
are
borne
with
charming
amiability
everything
is
shown
and
explained
in
detail
the
huge
gun
with
its
loading
apparatus
and
directing
machinery
the
batteries
the
torpedoes
with
their
the
electric
lantern
with
its

mechanism
i
myself
though
a
foreigner
and
therefore
requiring
a
special
permit
am
guided
all
about
both
below
and
above
and
am
even
suffered
to
take
a
peep
at
the
portraits
of
their
imperial
majesties
in
the
admiral
cabin
and
i
am
told
the
stirring
story
of
the
great
fight
off
the
yalu
meanwhile
the
old
bald
men
and
the
women
and
the
babies
of
the
port
hold
for
one
golden
day
command
of
the
matsushima
officers
cadets
spare
no
effort
to
please
some
talk
to
the
grandfathers
others
let
the
children
play
with
the
hilts
of
their
swords
or
teach
them
how
to
throw
up
their
little
hands
and
shout
banzai
and
for
tired
mothers
matting
has
been
spread
where
they
can
squat
down
in
the
shade
between
decks
those
decks
only
a
few
months
ago
were
covered
with
the
blood
of
brave
men
here
and
there
dark
stains
which
still
resist
are
visible
and
the
people
look
at
them
with
tender
reverence
the
flagship
was
twice
struck
by
enormous
shells
and
her
vulnerable
parts
were
pierced
by
a
storm
of
small
projectiles
she
bore
the
brunt
of
the
engagement
losing
nearly
half
her
crew
her
tonnage
is
only
four
thousand
two
hundred
and
eighty
and
her
immediate
antagonists
were
two
chinese
ironclads
of
seven
thousand
four
hundred
tons
each
outside
her
cuirass
shows
no
deep
scars
for
the
shattered
plates
have
been
replaced
but
my
guide
points
proudly
to
the
numerous
patchings
of
the
decks
the
steel
masting
supporting
the
the
and
to
certain
terrible
dents
with
small
cracks
radiating
from
them
in
the
steel
of
the
barbette
he
traces
for
us
below
the
course
of
the
centimetre
shell
that
pierced
the
ship
when
it
came
he
tells
us
the
shock
threw
men
into
the
air
that
high
holding
his
hand
some
two
feet
above
the
deck
at
the
same
moment
all
became
dark
you
could
not
see
your
hand
then
we
found
that
one
of
the
starboard
forward
guns
had
been
smashed
and
the
crew
all
killed
we
had
forty
men
killed
instantly
and
many
more
wounded
no
man
escaped
in
that
part
of
the
ship
the
deck
was
on
fire
because
a
lot
of
ammunition
brought
up
for
the
guns
had
exploded
so
we
had
to
fight
and
to
work
to
put
out
the
fire
at
the
same
time
even
badly
wounded
men
with
the
skin
blown
from
their
hands
and
faces
worked
as
if
they
felt
no
pain
and
dying
men
helped
to
pass
water
but
we
silenced
the
with
one
more
shot
from
our
big
gun
the
chinese
had
european
gunners
helping
them
if
we
had
not
had
to
fight
against
western
gunners
victory
would
have
been
too
he
gives
the
true
note
nothing
on
this
splendid
spring
day
could
so
delight
the
men
of
the
matsushima
kan
as
a
command
to
clear
for
action
and
attack
the
great
belted
russian
cruisers
lying
off
the
coast
iv
kobe
june
last
year
while
traveling
from
shimonoseki
to
the
capital
i
saw
many
regiments
on
their
way
to
the
seat
of
war
all
uniformed
in
white
for
the
hot
season
was
not
yet
over
those
soldiers
looked
so
much
like
students
whom
i
had
taught
thousands
indeed
were
really
fresh
from
school
that
i
could
not
help
feeling
it
was
cruel
to
send
such
youths
to
battle
the
boyish
faces
were
so
frank
so
cheerful
so
seemingly
innocent
of
the
greater
sorrows
of
life
do
fear
for
them
said
an
english
a
man
who
had
passed
his
life
in
camps
they
will
give
a
splendid
account
of
themselves
i
know
it
was
my
answer
but
i
am
thinking
of
fever
and
frost
and
manchurian
winter
these
are
more
to
be
feared
than
chinese
rifles
the
calling
of
the
bugles
gathering
the
men
together
after
dark
or
signaling
the
hour
of
rest
had
for
years
been
one
of
the
pleasures
of
my
summer
evenings
in
a
japanese
garrison
town
but
during
the
months
of
war
those
long
plaintive
notes
of
the
last
call
touched
me
in
another
way
i
do
not
know
that
the
melody
is
peculiar
but
it
was
sometimes
played
i
used
to
think
with
peculiar
feeling
and
when
uttered
to
the
starlight
by
all
the
bugles
of
a
division
at
once
the
multitudinously
blending
tones
had
a
melancholy
sweetness
never
to
be
forgotten
and
i
would
dream
of
phantom
buglers
summoning
the
youth
and
strength
of
hosts
to
the
shadowy
silence
of
perpetual
rest
well
i
went
to
see
some
of
the
regiments
return
arches
of
greenery
had
been
erected
over
the
street
they
were
to
pass
through
leading
from
kobe
station
to
the
great
temple
dedicated
to
the
hero
spirit
of
kusunoki
masashige
the
citizens
had
subscribed
six
thousand
yen
for
the
honor
of
serving
the
soldiers
with
the
first
meal
after
their
return
and
many
battalions
had
already
received
such
kindly
welcome
the
sheds
under
which
they
ate
in
the
court
of
the
temple
had
been
decorated
with
flags
and
festoons
and
there
were
gifts
for
all
the
troops
sweetmeats
and
packages
of
cigarettes
and
little
towels
printed
with
poems
in
praise
of
valor
before
the
gate
of
the
temple
a
really
handsome
triumphal
arch
had
been
erected
bearing
on
each
of
its
facades
a
phrase
of
welcome
in
chinese
text
of
gold
and
on
its
summit
a
terrestrial
globe
surmounted
by
a
hawk
with
outspread
pinions
i
waited
first
with
manyemon
before
the
station
which
is
very
near
the
temple
the
train
arrived
a
military
sentry
ordered
all
spectators
to
quit
the
platform
and
outside
in
the
street
police
kept
back
the
crowd
and
stopped
all
traffic
after
a
few
minutes
the
battalions
came
marching
in
regular
column
through
the
brick
archway
headed
by
a
gray
officer
who
limped
slightly
as
he
walked
smoking
a
cigarette
the
crowd
thickened
about
us
but
there
was
no
cheering
not
even
speaking
a
hush
broken
only
by
the
measured
tramp
of
the
passing
troops
i
could
scarcely
believe
those
were
the
same
men
i
had
seen
going
to
the
war
only
the
numbers
on
the
assured
me
of
the
fact
sunburnt
and
grim
the
faces
were
many
had
heavy
beards
the
dark
blue
winter
uniforms
were
frayed
and
torn
the
shoes
worn
into
shapelessness
but
the
strong
swinging
stride
was
the
stride
of
the
hardened
soldier
lads
no
longer
these
but
toughened
men
able
to
face
any
troops
in
the
world
men
who
had
slaughtered
and
stormed
men
who
had
also
suffered
many
things
which
never
will
be
written
the
features
showed
neither
joy
nor
pride
the
eyes
hardly
glanced
at
the
welcoming
flags
the
decorations
the
arch
with
its
hawk
of
battle
perhaps
because
those
eyes
had
seen
too
often
the
things
which
make
men
serious
only
one
man
smiled
as
he
passed
and
i
thought
of
a
smile
seen
on
the
face
of
a
zouave
when
i
was
a
boy
watching
the
return
of
a
regiment
from
africa
a
mocking
smile
that
stabbed
many
of
the
spectators
were
visibly
affected
feeling
the
reason
of
the
change
but
for
that
the
soldiers
were
better
soldiers
now
and
they
were
going
to
find
welcome
and
comforts
and
gifts
and
the
great
warm
love
of
the
people
and
repose
thereafter
in
their
old
familiar
camps
i
said
to
manyemon
this
evening
they
will
be
in
osaka
and
nagoya
they
will
hear
the
bugles
calling
and
they
will
think
of
comrades
who
never
can
return
the
old
man
answered
with
simple
earnestness
perhaps
by
western
people
it
is
thought
that
the
dead
never
return
but
we
can
not
so
think
there
are
no
japanese
dead
who
do
not

such
at

were
the
official
figures

published
in
the
kobe
chronicle
at
the
close
of
the
great
naval
engagement
of
the
of
september
a
hawk
alighted
on
the
of
the
japanese
cruiser
takachiho

suffered
itself
to
be
taken
and
fed
after
much
petting
this
bird
of
good
omen
was
presented
to
the
emperor
falconry
was
a
great
feudal
sport
in
japan
and
hawks
were
finely
trained

hawk
is
now
likely
to
become
more
than
ever
before
in

symbol
of
victory
vii
haru
haru
was
brought
up
chiefly
at
home
in
that
way
which
produced
one
of
the
sweetest
types
of
woman
the
world
has
ever
seen
this
domestic
education
cultivated
simplicity
of
heart
natural
grace
of
manner
obedience
and
love
of
duty
as
they
were
never
cultivated
but
in
japan
its
moral
product
was
something
too
gentle
and
beautiful
for
any
other
than
the
old
japanese
society
it
was
not
the
most
judicious
preparation
for
the
much
harsher
life
of
the
new
in
which
it
still
survives
the
refined
girl
was
trained
for
the
condition
of
being
theoretically
at
the
mercy
of
her
husband
she
was
taught
never
to
show
jealousy
or
grief
or
anger
even
under
circumstances
compelling
all
three
she
was
expected
to
conquer
the
faults
of
her
lord
by
pure
sweetness
in
short
she
was
required
to
be
almost
superhuman
to
realize
at
least
in
outward
seeming
the
ideal
of
perfect
unselfishness
and
this
she
could
do
with
a
husband
of
her
own
rank
delicate
in
discernment
able
to
divine
her
feelings
and
never
to
wound
them
haru
came
of
a
much
better
family
than
her
husband
and
she
was
a
little
too
good
for
him
because
he
could
not
really
understand
her
they
had
been
married
very
young
had
been
poor
at
first
and
then
had
gradually
become
because
haru
husband
was
a
clever
man
of
business
sometimes
she
thought
he
had
loved
her
most
when
they
were
less
well
off
and
a
woman
is
seldom
mistaken
about
such
matters
she
still
made
all
his
clothes
and
he
commended
her
she
waited
upon
his
wants
aided
him
to
dress
and
undress
made
everything
comfortable
for
him
in
their
pretty
home
bade
him
a
charming
farewell
as
he
went
to
business
in
the
morning
and
welcomed
him
upon
his
return
received
his
friends
exquisitely
managed
his
household
matters
with
wonderful
economy
and
seldom
asked
any
favors
that
cost
money
indeed
she
scarcely
needed
such
favors
for
he
was
never
ungenerous
and
liked
to
see
her
daintily
dressed
looking
like
some
beautiful
silver
moth
robed
in
the
folding
of
its
own
wings
and
to
take
her
to
theatres
and
other
places
of
amusement
she
accompanied
him
to
famed
for
the
blossoming
of
in
spring
or
the
shimmering
of
fireflies
on
summer
nights
or
the
crimsoning
of
maples
in
autumn
and
sometimes
they
would
pass
a
day
together
at
maiko
by
the
sea
where
the
pines
seem
to
sway
like
dancing
girls
or
an
afternoon
at
kiyomidzu
in
the
old
old
where
everything
is
like
a
dream
of
five
hundred
years
ago
and
where
there
is
a
great
shadowing
of
high
woods
and
a
song
of
water
leaping
cold
and
clear
from
caverns
and
always
the
plaint
of
flutes
unseen
blown
softly
in
the
antique
way
a
of
peace
and
sadness
blending
just
as
the
gold
light
glooms
into
blue
over
a
dying
sun
except
for
such
small
pleasures
and
excursions
haru
went
out
seldom
her
only
living
relatives
and
also
those
of
her
husband
were
far
away
in
other
provinces
and
she
had
few
visits
to
make
she
liked
to
be
at
home
arranging
flowers
for
the
alcoves
or
for
the
gods
decorating
the
rooms
and
feeding
the
tame
of
the
which
would
lift
up
their
heads
when
they
saw
her
coming
no
child
had
yet
brought
new
joy
or
sorrow
into
her
life
she
looked
in
spite
of
her
wife
coiffure
like
a
very
young
girl
and
she
was
still
simple
as
a
child
notwithstanding
that
business
capacity
in
small
things
which
her
husband
so
admired
that
he
often
condescended
to
ask
her
counsel
in
big
things
perhaps
the
heart
then
judged
for
him
better
than
the
pretty
head
but
whether
intuitive
or
not
her
advice
never
proved
wrong
she
was
happy
enough
with
him
for
five
years
during
which
time
he
showed
himself
as
considerate
as
any
young
japanese
merchant
could
well
be
towards
a
wife
of
finer
character
than
his
own
then
his
manner
suddenly
became
cold
so
suddenly
that
she
felt
assured
the
reason
was
not
that
which
a
childless
wife
might
have
reason
to
fear
unable
to
discover
the
real
cause
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
she
had
been
remiss
in
her
duties
examined
her
innocent
conscience
to
no
purpose
and
tried
very
very
hard
to
please
but
he
remained
unmoved
he
spoke
no
unkind
words
though
she
felt
behind
his
silence
the
repressed
tendency
to
utter
them
a
japanese
of
the
better
class
is
not
very
apt
to
be
unkind
to
his
wife
in
words
it
is
thought
to
be
vulgar
and
brutal
the
educated
man
of
normal
disposition
will
even
answer
a
wife
reproaches
with
gentle
phrases
common
politeness
by
the
japanese
code
exacts
this
attitude
from
every
manly
man
moreover
it
is
the
only
safe
one
a
refined
and
sensitive
woman
will
not
long
submit
to
coarse
treatment
a
spirited
one
may
even
kill
herself
because
of
something
said
in
a
moment
of
passion
and
such
a
suicide
disgraces
the
husband
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
there
are
slow
cruelties
worse
than
words
and
safer
neglect
or
indifference
for
example
of
a
sort
to
arouse
jealousy
a
japanese
wife
has
indeed
been
trained
never
to
show
jealousy
but
the
feeling
is
older
than
all
training
old
as
love
and
likely
to
live
as
long
beneath
her
passionless
mask
the
japanese
wife
feels
like
her
western
sister
just
like
that
sister
who
prays
and
prays
even
while
delighting
some
evening
assembly
of
beauty
and
fashion
for
the
coming
of
the
hour
which
will
set
her
free
to
relieve
her
pain
alone
haru
had
cause
for
jealousy
but
she
was
too
much
of
a
child
to
guess
the
cause
at
once
and
her
servants
too
fond
of
her
to
suggest
it
her
husband
had
been
accustomed
to
pass
his
evenings
in
her
company
either
at
home
or
elsewhere
but
now
evening
after
evening
he
went
out
by
himself
the
first
time
he
had
given
her
some
business
pretexts
afterwards
he
gave
none
and
did
not
even
tell
her
when
he
expected
to
return
latterly
also
he
had
been
treating
her
with
silent
rudeness
he
had
become
changed
as
if
there
was
a
goblin
in
his
heart
servants
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
been
deftly
caught
in
a
snare
set
for
him
one
whisper
from
a
geisha
had
numbed
his
will
one
smile
blinded
his
eyes
she
was
far
less
pretty
than
his
wife
but
she
was
very
skillful
in
the
craft
of
spinning
webs
webs
of
sensual
delusion
which
entangle
weak
men
and
always
tighten
more
and
more
about
them
until
the
final
hour
of
mockery
and
ruin
haru
did
not
know
she
suspected
no
wrong
till
after
her
husband
strange
conduct
had
become
habitual
and
even
then
only
because
she
found
that
his
money
was
passing
into
unknown
hands
he
had
never
told
her
where
he
passed
his
evenings
and
she
was
afraid
to
ask
lest
he
should
think
her
jealous
instead
of
exposing
her
feelings
in
words
she
treated
him
with
such
sweetness
that
a
more
intelligent
husband
would
have
divined
all
but
except
in
business
he
was
dull
he
continued
to
pass
his
evenings
away
and
as
his
conscience
grew
feebler
his
absences
lengthened
haru
had
been
taught
that
a
good
wife
should
always
sit
up
and
wait
for
her
lord
return
at
night
and
by
so
doing
she
suffered
from
nervousness
and
from
the
feverish
conditions
that
follow
sleeplessness
and
from
the
lonesomeness
of
her
waiting
after
the
servants
kindly
dismissed
at
the
usual
hour
had
left
her
with
her
thoughts
once
only
returning
very
late
her
husband
said
to
her
i
am
sorry
you
should
have
sat
up
so
late
for
me
do
not
wait
like
that
again
then
fearing
he
might
really
have
been
pained
on
her
account
she
laughed
pleasantly
and
said
i
was
not
sleepy
and
i
am
not
tired
honorably
please
not
to
think
about
me
so
he
ceased
to
think
about
her
glad
to
take
her
at
her
word
and
not
long
after
that
he
stayed
away
for
one
whole
night
the
next
night
he
did
likewise
and
a
third
night
after
that
third
night
absence
he
failed
even
to
return
for
the
morning
meal
and
haru
knew
the
time
had
come
when
her
duty
as
a
wife
obliged
her
to
speak
she
waited
through
all
the
morning
hours
fearing
for
him
fearing
for
herself
also
conscious
at
last
of
the
wrong
by
which
a
woman
heart
can
be
most
deeply
wounded
her
faithful
servants
had
told
her
something
the
rest
she
could
guess
she
was
very
ill
and
did
not
know
it
she
knew
only
that
she
was
angry
selfishly
angry
because
of
the
pain
given
her
cruel
probing
sickening
pain
midday
came
as
she
sat
thinking
how
she
could
say
least
selfishly
what
it
was
now
her
duty
to
say
the
first
words
of
reproach
that
would
ever
have
passed
her
lips
then
her
heart
leaped
with
a
shock
that
made
everything
blur
and
swim
before
her
sight
in
a
whirl
of
dizziness
because
there
was
a
sound
of
and
the
voice
of
a
servant
calling
she
struggled
to
the
entrance
to
meet
him
all
her
slender
body
with
fever
and
pain
and
terror
of
betraying
that
pain
and
the
man
was
startled
because
instead
of
greeting
him
with
the
accustomed
smile
she
caught
the
bosom
of
his
silk
robe
in
one
quivering
little
hand
and
looked
into
his
face
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
search
for
some
shred
of
a
soul
and
tried
to
speak
but
could
utter
only
the
single
word
almost
in
the
same
moment
her
weak
grasp
loosened
her
eyes
closed
with
a
strange
smile
and
even
before
he
could
put
out
his
arms
to
support
her
she
fell
he
sought
to
lift
her
but
something
in
the
delicate
life
had
snapped
she
was
dead
there
were
astonishments
of
course
and
tears
and
useless
callings
of
her
name
and
much
running
for
doctors
but
she
lay
white
and
still
and
beautiful
all
the
pain
and
anger
gone
out
of
her
face
and
smiling
as
on
her
bridal
day
two
physicians
came
from
the
public
hospital
japanese
military
surgeons
they
asked
straight
hard
questions
questions
that
cut
open
the
self
of
the
man
down
to
the
core
then
they
told
him
truth
cold
and
sharp
as
edged
steel
and
left
him
with
his
dead
the
people
wondered
he
did
not
become
a
priest
fair
evidence
that
his
conscience
had
been
awakened
by
day
he
sits
among
his
bales
of
kyoto
silks
and
osaka
figured
goods
earnest
and
silent
his
clerks

him

good
master
he
never
speaks
harshly
often
he
works
far
into
the
night
and
he
has
changed
his
there
are
strangers
in
the
pretty
house
where
haru
lived
and
the
owner
never
visits
it
perhaps
because
he
might
see
there
one
slender
shadow
still
arranging
flowers
or
bending
with
above
the
goldfish
in
his
pond
but
wherever
he
rest
sometime
in
the
silent
hours
he
must
see
the
same
soundless
presence
near
his
pillow
sewing
smoothing
softly
seeming
to
make
beautiful
the
robes
he
once
put
on
only
to
betray
and
at
other
times
in
the
busiest
moments
of
his
busy
life
the
clamor
of
the
great
shop
dies
the
ideographs
of
his
ledger
dim
and
vanish
and
a
plaintive
little
voice
which
the
gods
refuse
to
silence
utters
into
the
solitude
of
his
heart

a
question

native

the
real
japanese
city
stretches
away
into
regions
imperfectly
known
to
the
average
settler
this
native
town
remains
a
world
of
mysteries

may
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
enter
it
for
ten
years
at
a
time
it
has
no
interest
for
him
as
he
is
not
a
student
of
native
customs
but
simply
a
man
of
business
and
he
has
no
time
to
think
how
queer
it
all
is
merely
to
cross
the
concession
line
is
almost
the
same
thing
as
to
cross
the
pacific
ocean
which
is
much
less
wide
than
the
difference
between
the
races
enter
alone
into
the
interminable
narrow
maze
of
japanese
streets
and
the
dogs
will
bark
at
you
and
the
children
stare
at
you
as
if
you
were
the
only
foreigner
they
ever
saw
perhaps
they
will
even
call
after
you
ijin
tojin
or
the
last
of
which
signifies
hairy
foreigner
and
is
not
intended
as
a
compliment
ii
for
a
long
time
the
merchants
of
the
concessions
had
their
own
way
in
everything
and
forced
upon
the
native
firms
methods
of
business
to
which
no
occidental
merchant
would
think
of
submitting
methods
which
plainly
expressed
the
foreign
conviction
that
all
japanese
were
tricksters
no
foreigner
would
then
purchase
anything
until
it
had
been
long
enough
in
his
hands
to
be
examined
and
and
exhaustively
examined
or
accept
any
order
for
imports
unless
the
order
were
accompanied
by
a
substantial
payment
of
bargain
money
japanese
buyers
and
sellers
protested
in
vain
they
found
themselves
obliged
to
submit
but
they
bided
their
time
yielding
only
with
the
determination
to
conquer
the
rapid
growth
of
the
foreign
town
and
the
immense
capital
successfully
invested
therein
proved
to
them
how
much
they
would
have
to
learn
before
being
able
to
help
themselves
they
wondered
without
admiring
and
traded
with
the
foreigners
or
worked
for
them
while
secretly
detesting
them
in
old
japan
the
merchant
ranked
below
the
common
peasant
but
these
foreign
invaders
assumed
the
tone
of
princes
and
the
insolence
of
conquerors
as
employers
they
were
usually
harsh
and
sometimes
brutal
nevertheless
they
were
wonderfully
wise
in
the
matter
of
making
money
they
lived
like
kings
and
paid
high
salaries
it
was
desirable
that
young
men
should
suffer
in
their
service
for
the
sake
of
learning
things
which
would
have
to
be
learned
to
save
the
country
from
passing
under
foreign
rule
some
day
japan
would
have
a
mercantile
marine
of
her
own
and
foreign
banking
agencies
and
foreign
credit
and
be
well
able
to
rid
herself
of
these
haughty
strangers
in
the
meanwhile
they
should
be
endured
as
teachers
so
the
import
and
export
trade
remained
entirely
in
foreign
hands
and
it
grew
from
nothing
to
a
value
of
hundreds
of
millions
and
japan
was
well
exploited
but
she
knew
that
she
was
only
paying
to
learn
and
her
patience
was
of
that
kind
which
endures
so
long
as
to
be
mistaken
for
oblivion
of
injuries
her
opportunities
came
in
the
natural
order
of
things
the
growing
influx
of
aliens
seeking
fortune
gave
her
the
first
advantage
the
intercompetition
for
japanese
trade
broke
down
old
methods
and
new
firms
being
glad
to
take
orders
and
risks
without
large
could
no
longer
be
exacted
the
relations
between
foreigners
and
japanese
simultaneously
improved
as
the
latter
showed
a
dangerous
capacity
for
sudden
combination
against
could
not
be
cowed
by
revolvers
would
not
suffer
abuse
of
any
sort
and
knew
how
to
dispose
of
the
most
dangerous
rowdy
in
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
already
the
rougher
japanese
of
the
ports
the
dregs
of
the
populace
were
ready
to
assume
the
aggressive
on
the
least
provocation
within
two
decades
from
the
founding
of
the
settlements
those
foreigners
who
once
imagined
it
a
mere
question
of
time
when
the
whole
country
would
belong
to
them
began
to
understand
how
greatly
they
had
underestimated
the
race
the
japanese
had
been
learning
wonderfully
well
nearly
as
well
as
the
chinese
they
were
supplanting
the
small
foreign
shopkeepers
and
various
establishments
had
been
compelled
to
close
because
of
japanese
competition
even
for
large
firms
the
era
of
easy
was
over
the
period
of
hard
work
was
commencing
in
early
days
all
the
personal
wants
of
foreigners
had
necessarily
been
supplied
by
foreigners
so
that
a
large
retail
trade
had
grown
up
under
the
patronage
of
the
wholesale
trade
the
retail
trade
of
the
settlements
was
evidently
doomed
some
of
its
branches
had
disappeared
the
rest
were
visibly
diminishing
the
economic
foreign
clerk
or
assistant
in
a
business
house
can
not
well
afford
to
live
at
the
local
hotels
he
can
hire
a
japanese
cook
at
a
very
small
sum
per
month
or
can
have
his
meals
sent
him
from
a
japanese
restaurant
at
five
to
seven
sen

plate
he
lives
in
a
house
constructed
in

and
owned
by
a
japanese
the

or
mattings
on
his
floor
are
of
japanese
manufacture
his
furniture
is
supplied
by
a
japanese
his
suits
shirts
shoes
umbrella
are
japanese
make
even
the
soap
on
his
washstand
is
stamped
with
japanese
ideographs
if
a
smoker
he
buys
his
manila
cigars
from
a
japanese
tobacconist
half
a
dollar
cheaper
per
box
than
any
foreign
house
would
charge
him
for
the
same
quality
if
he
wants
books
he
can
buy
them
at
much
lower
prices
from
a
japanese
than
from
a
foreign
book
dealer
and
select
his
purchases
from
a
much
larger
and
stock
if
he
wants
a
photograph
taken
he
goes
to
a
japanese
gallery
no
foreign
photographer
could
make
a
living
in
japan
if
he
wants
curios
he
visits
a
japanese
house
the
foreign
dealer
would
charge
him
a
hundred
per
cent
dearer
on
the
other
hand
if
he
be
a
man
of
family
his
daily
marketing
is
supplied
by
japanese
butchers
fishmongers
dairymen
vegetable
dealers
he
may
continue
for
a
time
to
buy
english
or
american
hams
bacon
canned
goods
from
some
foreign
provision
dealer
but
he
has
discovered
that
japanese
stores
now
offer
the
same
class
of
goods
at
lower
prices
if
he
drinks
good
beer
it
probably
comes
from
a
japanese
brewery
and
if
he
wants
a
good
quality
of
ordinary
wine
or
liquor
japanese
storekeepers
can
supply
it
at
rates
below
those
of
the
foreign
importer
indeed
the
only
things
he
can
not
buy
from
the
japanese
houses
are
just
those
things
which
he
can
not
afford
goods
such
as
only
rich
men
are
likely
to
purchase
and
finally
if
any
of
his
family
become
sick
he
can
consult
a
japanese
physician
who
will
charge
him
a
fee
perhaps
one
tenth
less
than
he
would
have
had
to
pay
a
foreign
physician
in
former
times
foreign
doctors
now
find
it
very
hard
to
live
unless
they
have
something
more
than
their
practice
to
rely
upon
even
when
the
foreign
doctor
brings
down
his
fee
to
a
dollar
a
visit
the
japanese
doctor
can
charge
two
and
still
crush
competition
for
he
furnishes
the
medicine
himself
at
prices
which
would
ruin
a
foreign
apothecary
there
are
doctors
and
doctors
of
course
as
in
all
countries
but
the
japanese
physician
capable
of
directing
a
public
or
military
hospital
is
not
easily
surpassed
in
his
profession
and
the
average
foreign
physician
can
not
possibly
compete
with
him
he
furnishes
no
prescriptions
to
be
taken
to
a
drugstore
his
drugstore
is
either
at
home
or
in
a
room
of
the
hospital
he
directs
these
facts
taken
at
random
out
of
a
multitude
imply
that
foreign
shops
or
as
we
call
them
in
america
stores
will
soon
cease
to
be
the
existence
of
some
has
been
prolonged
only
by
needless
and
foolish
trickery
on
the
part
of
some
petty
japanese
dealers
attempts
to
sell
abominable
decoctions
in
foreign
bottles
under
foreign
labels
to
adulterate
imported
goods
or
to
imitate
but
the
common
sense
of
the
japanese
dealers
as
a
mass
is
strongly
opposed
to
such
immorality
and
the
evil
will
soon
correct
itself
the
native
storekeepers
can
honestly
undersell
the
foreign
ones
because
able
not
only
to
underlive
them
but
to
make
fortunes
during
the
competition
this
has
been
for
some
time
well
recognized
in
the
concessions
but
the
delusion
prevailed
that
the
great
exporting
and
importing
firms
were
impregnable
that
they
could
still
control
the
whole
volume
of
commerce
with
the
west
and
that
no
japanese
companies
could
find
means
to
oppose
the
weight
of
foreign
capital
or
to
acquire
the
business
methods
according
to
which
it
was
employed
certainly
the
retail
trade
would
go
but
that
signified
little
the
great
firms
would
remain
and
multiply
and
would
increase
their
capacities

during
all
this
time
of
outward
changes
the
real
feeling
between
the
races
the
mutual
dislike
of
oriental
and
occidental
had
continued
to
grow
of
the
nine
or
ten
english
papers
published
in
the
open
ports
the
majority
expressed
day
after
day
one
side
of
this
dislike
in
the
language
of
ridicule
or
contempt
and
a
powerful
native
press
retorted
in
kind
with
dangerous
effectiveness
if
the
newspapers
did
not
actually
represent
as
i
believe
they
did
an
absolute
majority
in
sentiment
they
represented
at
least
the
weight
of
foreign
capital
and
the
preponderant
influences
of
the
settlements
the
english
newspapers
though
conducted
by
shrewd
men
and
distinguished
by
journalistic
abilities
of
no
common
order
could
not
appease
the
powerful
resentment
provoked
by
the
language
of
their
contemporaries
the
charges
of
barbarism
or
immorality
printed
in
english
were
promptly
answered
by
the
publication
in
japanese
dailies
of
the
scandals
of
the
open
ports
for
all
the
millions
of
the
empire
to
know
the
race
question
was
carried
into
japanese
politics
by
a
strong
league
the
foreign
concessions
were
openly
denounced
as
hotbeds
of
vice
and
the
national
anger
became
so
formidable
that
only
the
most
determined
action
on
the
part
of
the
government
could
have
prevented
disastrous
happenings
nevertheless
oil
was
still
poured
on
the
smothered
fire
by
foreign
editors
who
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
with
china
openly
took
the
part
of
china
this
policy
was
pursued
throughout
the
campaign
reports
of
imaginary
reverses
were
printed
recklessly
undeniable
victories
were
unjustly
belittled
and
after
the
war
had
been
decided
the
cry
was
raised
that
the
japanese
had
been
allowed
to
become
dangerous
later
on
the
interference
of
russia
was
applauded
and
the
sympathy
of
england
condemned
by
men
of
english
blood
the
effect
of
such
utterances
at
such
a
time
was
that
of
insult
never
to
be
forgiven
upon
a
people
who
never
forgive
utterances
of
hate
they
were
but
also
utterances
of
alarm
alarm
excited
by
the
signing
of
those
new
treaties
bringing
all
aliens
under
japanese
jurisdiction
and
fear
not
unfounded
of
another
agitation
with
the
formidable
new
sense
of
national
power
behind
it
premonitory
symptoms
of
such
agitation
were
really
apparent
in
a
general
tendency
to
insult
or
jeer
at
foreigners
and
in
some
rare
but
exemplary
acts
of
violence
the
government
again
found
it
necessary
to
issue
proclamations
and
warnings
against
such
demonstrations
of
national
anger
and
they
ceased
almost
as
quickly
as
they
began
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
their
cessation
was
due
largely
to
recognition
of
the
friendly
attitude
of
england
as
a
naval
power
and
the
worth
of
her
policy
to
japan
in
a
moment
of
danger
to
the
world
peace
england
too
had
first
rendered
possible
in
spite
of
the
passionate
outcries
of
her
own
subjects
in
the
far
east
and
the
leaders
of
the
people
were
grateful
otherwise
the
hatred
between
settlers
and
japanese
might
have
resulted
quite
as
badly
as
had
been
feared
in
the
beginning
of
course
this
mutual
antagonism
was
racial
and
therefore
natural
and
the
irrational
violence
of
prejudice
and
malignity
developed
at
a
later
day
was
inevitable
with
the
conflict
of
interests
no
foreigner
really
capable
of
estimating
the
conditions
could
have
seriously
entertained
any
hope
of
a
rapprochement
the
barriers
of
racial
feeling
of
emotional
differentiation
of
language
of
manners
and
beliefs
are
likely
to
remain
insurmountable
for
centuries
though
instances
of
warm
friendship
due
to
the
mutual
attraction
of
exceptional
natures
able
to
divine
each
other
intuitively
might
be
cited
the
foreigner
as
a
general
rule
understands
the
japanese
quite
as
little
as
the
japanese
understands
him
what
is
worse
for
the
alien
than
miscomprehension
is
the
simple
fact
that
he
is
in
the
position
of
an
invader
under
no
ordinary
circumstances
need
he
expect
to
be
treated
like
a
japanese
and
this
not
merely
because
he
has
more
money
at
his
command
but
because
of
his
race
one
price
for
the
foreigner
another
for
the
japanese
is
the
common
regulation
except
in
those
japanese
stores
which
depend
almost
exclusively
upon
foreign
trade
if
you
wish
to
enter
a
japanese
theatre
a
any
place
of
amusement
or
even
an
inn
you
must
pay
a
virtual
tax
upon
your
nationality
japanese
artisans
laborers
clerks
will
not
work
for
you
at
japanese
rates
unless
they
have
some
other
object
in
view
than
wages
japanese
except
in
those
hotels
built
and
furnished
especially
for
european
or
american
travelers
will
not
make
out
your
bill
at
regular
prices
large
have
been
formed
which
maintain
this
rule
companies
controlling
scores
of
establishments
throughout
the
country
and
able
to
dictate
terms
to
local
storekeepers
and
to
the
smaller
hostelries
it
has
been
generously
confessed
that
foreigners
ought
to
pay
higher
than
japanese
for
accommodation
since
they
give
more
trouble
and
this
is
true
but
under
even
these
facts
is
manifest
those
innkeepers
who
build
for
japanese
custom
only
in
the
great
centres
care
nothing
for
foreign
custom
and
often
lose
by
it
partly
because
native
guests
do
not
like
hotels
patronized
by
foreigners
and
partly
because
the
western
guest
wants
all
to
himself
the
room
which
can
be
rented
more
profitably
to
a
japanese
party
of
five
or
eight
another
fact
not
generally
understood
in
connection
with
this
is
that
in
old
japan
the
question
of
recompense
for
service
was
left
to
honor
the
japanese
innkeeper
always
supplied
and
in
the
country
often
still
supplies
food
at
scarcely
more
than
cost
and
his
real
profit
depended
upon
the
conscience
of
the
customer
hence
the
importance
of
the
chadai
or
present
of
to
the
hotel
from
the
poor
a
very
small
sum
from
the
rich
a
larger
sum
was
expected
according
to
services
rendered
in
like
manner
the
hired
servant
expected
to
be
remunerated
according
to
his
master
ability
to
pay
even
more
than
according
to
the
value
of
the
work
done
the
artist
preferred
when
working
for
a
good
patron
never
to
name
a
price
only
the
merchant
tried
to
get
the
better
of
his
customers
by
bargaining
the
immoral
privilege
of
his
class
it
may
be
readily
imagined
that
the
habit
of
trusting
to
honor
for
payment
produced
no
good
results
in
dealing
with
occidentals
all
matters
of
buying
and
selling
we
think
of
as
business
and
business
in
the
west
is
not
conducted
under
purely
abstract
ideas
of
morality
but
at
best
under
relative
and
partial
ideas
of
morality
a
generous
man
extremely
dislikes
to
have
the
price
of
an
article
which
he
wants
to
buy
left
to
his
conscience
for
unless
he
knows
exactly
the
value
of
the
material
and
the
worth
of
the
labor
he
feels
obliged
to
make
such
as
will
assure
him
that
he
has
done
more
than
right
while
the
selfish
man
takes
advantage
of
the
situation
to
give
as
nearly
next
to
nothing
as
he
can
special
rates
have
to
be
made
therefore
by
the
japanese
in
all
dealings
with
foreigners
but
the
dealing
itself
is
made
more
or
less
aggressive
according
to
circumstance
because
of
race
antagonism
the
foreigner
has
not
only
to
pay
higher
rates
for
every
kind
of
skilled
labor
but
must
sign
costlier
leases
and
submit
to
higher
rents
only
the
lowest
class
of
japanese
servants
can
be
hired
even
at
high
wages
by
a
foreign
household
and
their
stay
is
usually
brief
as
they
dislike
the
service
required
of
them
even
the
apparent
eagerness
of
educated
japanese
to
enter
foreign
employ
is
generally
misunderstood
their
veritable
purpose
being
simply
in
most
cases
to
fit
themselves
for
the
same
sort
of
work
in
japanese
business
houses
stores
and
hotels
the
average
japanese
would
prefer
to
work
fifteen
hours
a
day
for
one
of
his
own

than
eight
hours
a
day
for
a
foreigner
paying
higher
wages
i
have
seen
graduates
of
the
university
working
as
servants
but
they
were
working
only
to
learn
special
things
iv
really
the
dullest
foreigner
could
not
have
believed
that
a
people
of
forty
millions
uniting
all
their
energies
to
achieve
absolute
national
independence
would
remain
content
to
leave
the
management
of
their
country
import
and
export
trade
to
aliens
especially
in
view
of
the
feeling
in
the
open
ports
the
existence
of
foreign
settlements
in
japan
under
consular
jurisdiction
was
in
itself
a
constant
exasperation
to
national
pride
an
indication
of
national
weakness
it
had
so
been
proclaimed
in
print
in
speeches
by
members
of
the
league
in
speeches
made
in
parliament
but
knowledge
of
the
national
desire
to
control
the
whole
of
japanese
commerce
and
the
periodical
manifestations
of
hostility
to
foreigners
as
settlers
excited
only
temporary
uneasiness
it
was
confidently
asserted
that
the
japanese
could
only
injure
themselves
by
any
attempt
to
get
rid
of
foreign
negotiators
though
alarmed
at
the
prospect
of
being
brought
under
japanese
law
the
merchants
of
the
concessions
never
imagined
a
successful
attack
upon
large
interests
possible
except
by
violation
of
that
law
itself
it
signified
little
that
the
nippon
yusen
kwaisha
had
become
during
the
war
one
of
the
largest
steamship
companies
in
the
world
that
japan
was
trading
directly
with
india
and
china
that
japanese
banking
agencies
were
being
established
in
the
great
manufacturing
centres
abroad
that
japanese
merchants
were
sending
their
sons
to
europe
and
america
for
a
sound
commercial
education
because
japanese
lawyers
were
gaining
a
large
foreign
clientele
because
japanese
shipbuilders
architects
engineers
had
replaced
foreigners
in
government
service
it
did
not
at
all
follow
that
the
foreign
agents
controlling
the
import
and
export
trade
with
europe
and
america
could
be
dispensed
with
the
machinery
of
commerce
would
be
useless
in
japanese
hands
and
capacity
for
other
professions
by
no
means
augured
latent
capacity
for
business
the
foreign
capital
invested
in
japan
could
not
be
successfully
threatened
by
any
combinations
formed
against
it
some
japanese
houses
might
carry
on
a
small
import
business
but
the
export
trade
required
a
thorough
knowledge
of
business
conditions
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
such
connections
and
credits
as
the
japanese
could
not
obtain
nevertheless
the
of
the
foreign
importers
and
exporters
was
rudely
broken
in
july
when
a
british
house
having
brought
suit
against
a
japanese
company
in
a
japanese
court
for
refusal
to
accept
delivery
of
goods
ordered
and
having
won
a
judgment
for
nearly
thirty
thousand
dollars
suddenly
found
itself
confronted
and
menaced
by
a
guild
whose
power
had
never
been
suspected
the
japanese
firm
did
not
appeal
against
the
decision
of
the
court
it
expressed
itself
ready
to
pay
the
whole
sum
at
once
if
required
but
the
guild
to
which
it
belonged
informed
the
triumphant
plaintiffs
that
a
compromise
would
be
to
their
advantage
then
the
english
house
discovered
itself
threatened
with
a
boycott
which
could
utterly
ruin
it
a
boycott
operating
in
all
the
industrial
centres
of
the
empire
the
compromise
was
promptly
effected
at
considerable
loss
to
the
foreign
firm
and
the
settlements
were
dismayed
there
was
much
denunciation
of
the
immorality
of
the
proceeding
but
it
was
a
proceeding
against
which
the
law
could
do
nothing
for
boycotting
can
not
be
satisfactorily
dealt
with
under
law
and
it
afforded
proof
positive
that
the
japanese
were
able
to
force
foreign
firms
to
submit
to
their
dictation
by
foul
means
if
not
by
fair
enormous
guilds
had
been
organized
by
the
great
industries
combinations
whose
moves
perfectly
regulated
by
telegraph
could
ruin
opposition
and
could
set
at
defiance
even
the
judgment
of
tribunals
the
japanese
had
attempted
boycotting
in
previous
years
with
so
little
success
that
they
were
deemed
incapable
of
combination
but
the
new
situation
showed
how
well
they
had
learned
through
defeat
and
that
with
further
improvement
of
organization
they
could
reasonably
expect
to
get
the
foreign
trade
under
control
if
not
into
their
own
hands
it
would
be
the
next
great
step
toward
the
realization
of
the
national
desire
japan
only
for
the
japanese
even
though
the
country
should
be
opened
to
foreign
settlement
foreign
investments
would
always
be
at
the
mercy
of
japanese
combinations
a
kobe
merchant
of
great
experience
writing
to
the
kobe
chronicle
of
august
observed
i
am
not
attempting
to
defend
boycotts
but
i
firmly
believe
from
what
has
come
to
my
knowledge
that
in
each
and
every
case
there
has
been
provocation
irritating
the
japanese
rousing
their
feelings
and
their
sense
of
justice
and
driving
them
to
combination
as
a
defense
v
the
foregoing
brief
account
of
existing
conditions
may
suffice
to
prove
the
evolution
in
japan
of
a
social
phenomenon
of
great
significance
of
course
the
prospective
opening
of
the
country
under
new
treaties
the
rapid
development
of
its
industries
and
the
vast
annual
increase
in
the
volume
of
trade
with
america
and
europe
will
probably
bring
about
some
increase
of
foreign
settlers
and
this
temporary
result
might
deceive
many
as
to
the
inevitable
drift
of
things
but
old
merchants
of
experience
even
now
declare
that
the
probable
further
expansion
of
the
ports
will
really
mean
the
growth
of
a
native
competitive
commerce
that
must
eventually
dislodge
foreign
merchants
the
foreign
settlements
as
communities
will
disappear
there
will
remain
only
some
few
great
agencies
such
as
exist
in
all
the
chief
ports
of
the
civilized
world
and
the
abandoned
streets
of
the
concessions
and
the
costly
foreign
houses
on
the
heights
will
be
peopled
and
tenanted
by
japanese
large
foreign
investments
will
not
be
made
in
the
interior
and
even
christian
must
be
left
to
native
missionaries
for
just
as
buddhism
never
took
definite
form
in
japan
until
the
teaching
of
its
doctrines
was
left
entirely
to
japanese
priests
so
christianity
will
never
take
any
fixed
shape
till
it
has
been
so
remodeled
as
to
harmonize
with
the
emotional
and
social
life
of
the
race
even
thus
remodeled
it
can
scarcely
hope
to
exist
except
in
the
form
of
a
few
small
sects
the
social
phenomenon
exhibited
can
be
best
explained
by
a
simile
in
many
ways
a
human
society
may
be
compared
biologically
with
an
individual
organism
foreign
elements
introduced
forcibly
into
the
system
of
either
and
impossible
to
assimilate
set
up
irritations
and
partial
disintegration
until
eliminated
naturally
or
removed
artificially
japan
is
strengthening
herself
through
elimination
of
disturbing
elements
and
this
natural
process
is
symbolized
in
the
resolve
to
regain
possession
of
all
the
concessions
to
bring
about
the
abolishment
of
consular
jurisdiction
to
leave
nothing
under
foreign
control
within
the
empire
it
is
also
manifested
in
the
dismissal
of
foreign
employes
in
the
resistance
offered
by
japanese
congregations
to
the
authority
of
foreign
missionaries
and
in
the
resolute
boycotting
of
foreign
merchants
and
behind
all
this
there
is
more
than
there
is
also
the
definite
conviction
that
foreign
help
is
proof
of
national
feebleness
and
that
the
empire
remains
disgraced
before
the
eyes
of
the
commercial
world
so
long
as
its
import
and
export
trade
are
managed
by
aliens
several
large
japanese
firms
have
quite
emancipated
themselves
from
the
domination
of
foreign
middlemen
large
trade
with
india
and
china
is
being
carried
on
by
japanese
steamship
companies
and
communication
with
the
southern
states
of
america
is
soon
to
be
established
by
the
nippon
yusen
kwaisha
for
the
direct
importation
of
cotton
but
the
foreign
settlements
remain
constant
sources
of
irritation
and
their
commercial
conquest
by
untiring
national
effort
will
alone
satisfy
the
country
and
will
prove
even
better
than
the
war
with
china
japan
real
place
among
nations
that
conquest
i
think
will
certainly
be
achieved
vi
what
of
the
future
of
japan
no
one
can
venture
any
positive
prediction
on
the
assumption
that
existing
tendencies
will
continue
far
into
that
future
not
to
dwell
upon
the
grim
probabilities
of
war
or
the
possibility
of
such
internal
disorder
as
might
compel
indefinite
suspension
of
the
constitution
and
lead
to
a
military
dictatorship
a
resurrected
shogunate
in
modern
uniform
great
changes
there
will
assuredly
be
both
for
better
and
for
worse
supposing
these
changes
normal
however
one
may
venture
some
qualified
predictions
based
upon
the
reasonable
supposition
that
the
race
will
continue
through
rapidly
alternating
periods
of
action
and
reaction
to
assimilate
its
knowledge
with
the
best
relative
consequences
physically
i
think
the
japanese
will
become
before
the
close
of
the
next
century
much
superior
to
what
they
now
are
for
such
belief
there
are
three
good
reasons
the
first
is
that
the
systematic
military
and
gymnastic
training
of
the
youth
of
the
empire
ought
in
a
few
generations
to
produce
results
as
marked
as
those
of
the
military
system
in
germany
increase
in
stature
in
average
girth
of
chest
in
muscular
development
another
reason
is
that
the
japanese
of
the
cities
are
taking
to
a
richer
diet
a
flesh
diet
and
that
a
more
nutritive
food
must
have
physiological
results
favoring
growth
immense
numbers
of
little
restaurants
are
everywhere
springing
up
in
which
western
cooking
is
furnished
almost
as
cheaply
as
japanese
food
thirdly
the
delay
of
marriage
necessitated
by
education
and
by
military
service
must
result
in
the
production
of
finer
and
finer
generations
of
children
as
immature
marriages
become
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
children
of
feeble
constitution
will
correspondingly
diminish
in
number
at
present
the
extraordinary
differences
of
stature
noticeable
in
any
japanese
crowd
seem
to
prove
that
the
race
is
capable
of
great
physical
development
under
a
severer
social
discipline
moral
improvement
is
hardly
to
be
expected
rather
the
reverse
the
old
moral
ideals
of
japan
were
at
least
quite
as
noble
as
our
own
and
men
could
really
live
up
to
them
in
the
quiet
benevolent
times
of
patriarchal
government
untruthfulness
dishonesty
and
brutal
crime
were
rarer
than
now
as
official
statistics
show
the
percentage
of
crime
having
been
for
some
years
steadily
on
the
increase
which
proves
of
course
among
other
things
that
the
struggle
for
existence
has
been
intensified
the
old
standard
of
chastity
as
represented
in
public
opinion
was
that
of
a
less
developed
society
than
our
own
yet
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
truthfully
asserted
that
the
moral
conditions
were
worse
than
with
us
in
one
respect
they
were
certainly
better
for
the
virtue
of
japanese
wives
was
generally
in
all
ages
above
suspicion
if
the
morals
of
men
were
much
more
open
to
reproach
it
is
not
necessary
to
cite
lecky
for
evidence
as
to
whether
a
much
better
state
of
things
prevails
in
the
occident
early
marriages
were
encouraged
to
guard
young
men
from
temptations
to
irregular
life
and
it
is
only
fair
to
suppose
that
in
a
majority
of
cases
this
result
was
obtained
concubinage
the
privilege
of
the
rich
had
its
evil
side
but
it
had
also
the
effect
of
relieving
the
wife
from
the
physical
strain
of
rearing
many
children
in
rapid
succession
the
social
conditions
were
so
different
from
those
which
western
religion
assumes
to
be
the
best
possible
that
an
impartial
judgment
of
them
can
not
be
ecclesiastical
one
fact
is
indisputable
that
they
were
unfavorable
to
professional
vice
and
in
many
of
the
larger
fortified
towns
the
seats
of
princes
no
houses
of
prostitution
were
suffered
to
exist
when
all
things
are
fairly
considered
it
will
be
found
that
old
japan
might
claim
in
spite
of
her
patriarchal
system
to
have
been
less
open
to
reproach
even
in
the
matter
of
sexual
morality
than
many
a
western
country
the
people
were
better
than
their
laws
asked
them
to
be
and
now
that
the
relations
of
the
sexes
are
to
be
regulated
by
new
codes
at
a
time
when
new
codes
are
really
needed
the
changes
which
it
is
desirable
to
bring
about
can
not
result
in
immediate
good
sudden
reforms
are
not
made
by
legislation
laws
can
not
directly
create
sentiment
and
real
social
progress
can
be
made
only
through
change
of
ethical
feeling
developed
by
long
discipline
and
training
meanwhile
increasing
pressure
of
population
and
increasing
competition
must
tend
while
quickening
intelligence
to
harden
character
and
develop
selfishness
intellectually
there
will
doubtless
be
great
progress
but
not
a
progress
so
rapid
as
those
who
think
that
japan
has
really
transformed
herself
in
thirty
years
would
have
us
believe
however
widely
diffused
among
the
people
scientific
education
can
not
immediately
raise
the
average
of
practical
intelligence
to
the
western
level
the
common
capacity
must
remain
lower
for
generations
there
will
be
plenty
of
remarkable
exceptions
indeed
and
a
new
aristocracy
of
intellect
is
coming
into
existence
but
the
real
future
of
the
nation
depends
rather
upon
the
general
capacity
of
the
many
than
upon
the
exceptional
capacity
of
the
few
perhaps
it
depends
especially
upon
the
development
of
the
mathematical
faculty
which
is
being
everywhere
assiduously
cultivated
at
present
this
is
the
weak
point
hosts
of
students
being
yearly
debarred
from
the
more
important
classes
of
higher
study
through
inability
to
pass
in
mathematics
at
the
imperial
naval
and
military
colleges
however
such
results
have
been
obtained
as
suffice
to
show
that
this
weakness
will
eventually
be
remedied
the
most
difficult
branches
of
scientific
study
will
become
less
formidable
to
the
children
of
those
who
have
been
able
to
distinguish
themselves
in
such
branches
in
other
respects
some
temporary
retrogression
is
to
be
looked
for
just
so
certainly
as
japan
has
attempted
that
which
is
above
the
normal
limit
of
her
powers
so
certainly
must
she
fall
back
to
that
limit
or
rather
below
it
such
retrogression
will
be
natural
as
well
as
necessary
it
will
mean
nothing
more
than
a
recuperative
preparation
for
stronger
and
loftier
efforts
signs
of
it
are
even
now
visible
in
the
working
of
certain
notably
in
that
of
education
the
idea
of
forcing
upon
oriental
students
a
course
of
study
above
the
average
capacity
of
western
students
the
idea
of
making
english
the
language
or
at
least
one
of
the
languages
of
the
country
and
the
idea
of
changing
ancestral
modes
of
feeling
and
thinking
for
the
better
by
such
training
were
wild
extravagances
japan
must
develop
her
own
soul
she
can
not
borrow
another
a
dear
friend
whose
life
has
been
devoted
to
philology
once
said
to
me
while
commenting
upon
the
deterioration
of
manners
among
the
students
of
japan
the
english
language
itself
has
been
a
demoralizing
influence
there
was
much
depth
in
that
observation
setting
the
whole
japanese
nation
to
study
english
the
language
of
a
people
who
are
being
forever
preached
to
about
their
rights
and
never
about
their
duties
was
almost
an
imprudence
the
policy
was
too
wholesale
as
well
as
too
sudden
it
involved
great
waste
of
money
and
time
and
it
helped
to
sap
ethical
sentiment
in
the
future
japan
will
learn
english
just
as
england
learns
german
but
if
this
study
has
been
wasted
in
some
directions
it
has
not
been
wasted
in
others
the
influence
of
english
has
effected
modifications
in
the
native
tongue
making
it
richer
more
flexible
and
more
capable
of
expressing
the
new
forms
of
thought
created
by
the
discoveries
of
modern
science
this
influence
must
long
continue
there
will
be
a
considerable
absorption
of
english
perhaps
also
of
french
and
german
words
into
japanese
indeed
this
absorption
is
already
marked
in
the
changing
speech
of
the
educated
classes
not
less
than
in
the
colloquial
of
the
ports
which
is
mixed
with
curious
modifications
of
foreign
commercial
words
furthermore
the
grammatical
structure
of
japanese
is
being
influenced
and
though
i
can
not
agree
with
a
clergyman
who
lately
declared
that
the
use
of
the
passive
voice
by
tokyo
announcing
the
fall
of
port
arthur
ga
senryo
represented
the
working
of
divine
providence
i
do
think
it
afforded
some
proof
that
the
japanese
language
assimilative
like
the
genius
of
the
race
is
showing
capacity
to
meet
all
demands
made
upon
it
by
the
new
conditions
perhaps
japan
will
remember
her
foreign
teachers
more
kindly
in
the
twentieth
century
but
she
will
never
feel
toward
the
occident
as
she
felt
toward
china
before
the
meiji
era
the
reverential
respect
due
by
ancient
custom
to
a
beloved
instructor
for
the
wisdom
of
china
was
voluntarily
sought
while
that
of
the
west
was
thrust
upon
her
by
violence
she
will
have
some
christian
sects
of
her
own
but
she
will
not
remember
our
american
and
english
missionaries
as
she
remembers
even
now
those
great
chinese
priests
who
once
educated
her
youth
and
she
will
not
preserve
relics
of
our
sojourn
carefully
wrapped
in
septuple
coverings
of
silk
and
packed
way
in
dainty
whitewood
boxes
because
we
had
no
new
lesson
of
beauty
to
teach
her
nothing
by
which
to
appeal
to
her
emotions
the
statement
has
been
made
that
there
is
no
word
for
chastity
in
the
japanese
language
this
is
true
in
the
same
sense
only
that
we
might
say
there
is
no
word
for
chastity
in
the
english
language
became
such
words
as
honor
virtue
purity
chastity
have
been
adopted
into
english
from
other
languages
open
any
good
dictionary
and
you
will
find
many
words
for
chastity
just
as
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
deny
that
the
word
chastity
is
modern
english
because
it
came
to
us
through
the
french
from
the
latin
so
it
is
ridiculous
to
deny
that
chinese
moral
terms
adopted
into
the
japanese
tongue
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
are
japanese
the
statement
like
a
majority
of
missionary
statements
on
these
subjects
is
otherwise
misleading
for
the
reader
is
left
to
infer
the
absence
of
an
adjective
as
well
as
a
noun
and
the
purely
japanese
adjectives
signifying
chaste
are
numerous
the
word
most
commonly
used
applies
to
both
sexes
and
has
the
old
japanese
sense
of
firm
strict
resisting
honorable
the
deficiency
of
abstract
terms
in
a
language
by
no
means
implies
the
deficiency
of
concrete
moral
ideas
a
fact
which
has
been
vainly
pointed
out
to
missionaries
more
than
once
ix
by
force
of
karma
the
face
of
the
beloved
and
the
face
of
the
risen
sun
can
not
be
looked
at
proverb
i
modern
science
assures
us
that
the
passion
of
first
love
so
far
as
the
individual
may
be
concerned
is
absolutely
antecedent
to
all
relative
experience
whatever
in
other
words
that
which
might
well
seem
to
be
the
most
strictly
personal
of
all
feelings
is
not
an
individual
matter
at
all
philosophy
discovered
the
same
fact
long
ago
and
never
theorized
more
attractively
than
when
trying
to
explain
the
mystery
of
the
passion
science
so
far
has
severely
limited
itself
to
a
few
suggestions
on
the
subject
this
seems
a
pity
because
the
metaphysicians
could
at
no
time
give
properly
detailed
explanations
whether
teaching
that
the
first
sight
of
the
beloved
quickens
in
the
soul
of
the
lover
some
dormant
prenatal
remembrance
of
divine
truth
or
that
the
illusion
is
made
by
spirits
unborn
seeking
incarnation
but
science
and
philosophy
both
agree
as
to
one
fact
that
the
lovers
themselves
have
no
choice
that
they
are
merely
the
subjects
of
an
influence
science
is
even
the
more
positive
on
this
point
it
states
quite
plainly
that
the
dead
not
the
living
are
responsible
there
would
seem
to
be
some
sort
of
ghostly
remembrance
in
first
loves
it
is
true
that
science
unlike
buddhism
does
not
declare
that
under
particular
conditions
we
may
begin
to
recollect
our
former
lives
that
psychology
which
is
based
upon
physiology
even
denies
the
possibility
of
in
this
individual
sense
but
it
allows
that
something
more
powerful
though
more
indefinite
is
inherited
the
sum
of
ancestral
memories
incalculable
the
sum
of
countless
billions
of
trillions
of
experiences
thus
can
it
interpret
our
most
enigmatical
sensations
our
conflicting
impulses
strangest
intuitions
all
those
seemingly
irrational
attractions
or
repulsions
all
those
vague
sadnesses
or
joys
never
to
be
accounted
for
by
individual
experience
but
it
has
not
yet
found
leisure
to
discourse
much
to
us
about
first
love
although
first
love
in
its
relation
to
the
world
invisible
is
the
very
weirdest
of
all
human
feelings
and
the
most
mysterious
in
our
occident
the
riddle
runs
thus
to
the
growing
youth
whose
life
is
normal
and
vigorous
there
comes
a
sort
of
atavistic
period
in
which
he
begins
to
feel
for
the
feebler
sex
that
primitive
contempt
created
by
mere
consciousness
of
physical
superiority
but
it
is
just
at
the
time
when
the
society
of
girls
has
grown
least
interesting
to
him
that
he
suddenly
becomes
insane
there
crosses
his
a
maiden
never
seen
before
but
little
different
from
other
daughters
of
men
not
at
all
wonderful
to
common
vision
at
the
same
instant
with
a
single
surging
shock
the
blood
rushes
to
his
heart
and
all
his
senses
are
bewitched
thereafter
till
the
madness
ends
his
life
belongs
wholly
to
that
being
of
whom
he
yet
knows
nothing
except
that
the
sun
light
seems
more
beautiful
when
it
touches
her
from
that
glamour
no
mortal
science
can
disenthrall
him
but
whose
the
witchcraft
is
it
any
power
in
the
living
idol
no
psychology
tells
us
that
it
is
the
power
of
the
dead
within
the
idolater
the
dead
cast
the
spell
theirs
the
shock
in
the
lover
heart
theirs
the
electric
shiver
that
tingled
through
his
veins
at
the
first
touch
of
one
girl
hand
but
why
they
should
want
her
rather
than
any
other
is
the
deeper
part
of
the
riddle
the
solution
offered
by
the
great
german
pessimist
will
not
harmonize
well
with
scientific
psychology
the
choice
of
the
dead
evolutionally
considered
would
be
a
choice
based
upon
remembrance
rather
than
on
prescience
and
the
enigma
is
not
cheerful
there
is
indeed
the
romantic
possibility
that
they
want
her
because
there
survives
in
her
as
in
some
composite
photograph
the
suggestion
of
each
and
all
who
loved
them
in
the
past
but
there
is
the
possibility
also
that
they
want
her
because
there
reappears
in
her
something
of
the
multitudinous
charm
of
all
the
women
they
loved
in
vain
assuming
the
more
nightmarish
theory
we
should
believe
that
passion
though
buried
again
and
again
can
neither
die
nor
rest
they
who
have
vainly
loved
only
seem
to
die
they
really
live
on
in
generations
of
hearts
that
their
desire
may
be
fulfilled
they
wait
perhaps
though
centuries
for
the
reincarnation
of
shapes
beloved
forever
weaving
into
the
dreams
of
youth
their
vapory
composite
of
memories
hence
the
ideals
unattainable
the
haunting
of
troubled
souls
by
the
in
the
far
east
thoughts
are
otherwise
and
what
i
am
about
to
write
concerns
the
interpretation
of
the
lord
buddha
herbert
spencer
principles
of
psychology
the
feelings
ii
a
priest
died
recently
under
very
peculiar
circumstances
he
was
the
priest
of
a
temple
belonging
to
one
of
the
older
buddhist
sects
in
a
village
near
osaka
you
can
see
that
temple
from
the
railway
as
you
go
by
train
to
kyoto
he
was
young
earnest
and
extremely
handsome
very
much
too
handsome
for
a
priest
the
women
said
he
looked
like
one
of
those
beautiful
figures
of
amida
made
by
the
great
buddhist
statuaries
of
other
days
the
men
of
his
parish
thought
him
a
pure
and
learned
priest
in
which
they
were
right
the
women
did
not
think
about
his
virtue
or
his
learning
only
he
possessed
the
unfortunate
power
to
attract
them
independently
of
his
own
will
as
a
mere
man
he
was
admired
by
them
and
even
by
women
of
other
parishes
also
in
ways
not
holy
and
their
admiration
interfered
with
his
studies
and
disturbed
his
meditations
they
found
irreproachable
pretexts
for
visiting
the
temple
at
all
hours
just
to
look
at
him
and
talk
to
him
asking
questions
which
it
was
his
duty
to
answer
and
making
religious
offerings
which
he
could
not
well
refuse
some
would
ask
questions
not
of
a
religious
kind
that
caused
him
to
blush
he
was
by
nature
too
gentle
to
protect
himself
by
severe
speech
even
when
forward
girls
from
the
city
said
things
that
never
would
have
said
things
that
made
him
tell
the
speakers
to
leave
his
presence
and
the
more
he
shrank
from
the
admiration
of
the
timid
or
the
adulation
of
the
unabashed
the
more
the
persecution
increased
till
it
became
the
torment
of
his
life
his
parents
had
long
been
dead
he
had
no
worldly
ties
he
loved
only
his
calling
and
the
studies
belonging
to
it
and
he
did
not
wish
to
think
of
foolish
and
forbidden
things
his
extraordinary
beauty
the
beauty
of
a
living
idol
was
only
a
misfortune
wealth
was
offered
him
under
conditions
that
he
could
not
even
discuss
girls
threw
themselves
at
his
feet
and
prayed
him
in
vain
to
love
them
were
constantly
being
sent
to
him
letters
which
never
brought
a
reply
some
were
written
in
that
classical
enigmatic
style
which
speaks
of
the
of
meeting
and
waves
on
the
shadow
of
a
face
and
streams
that
part
to
reunite
others
were
artless
and
frankly
tender
full
of
the
pathos
of
a
girl
first
confession
of
love
for
a
long
time
such
letters
left
the
young
priest
as
unmoved
to
outward
appearance
as
any
image
of
that
buddha
in
whose
likeness
he
seemed
to
have
been
made
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
not
a
buddha
but
only
a
weak
man
and
his
position
was
trying
one
evening
there
came
to
the
temple
a
little
boy
who
gave
him
a
letter
whispered
the
name
of
the
sender
and
ran
away
in
the
dark
according
to
the
subsequent
testimony
of
an
acolyte
the
priest
read
the
letter
restored
it
to
its
envelope
and
placed
it
on
the
matting
beside
his
kneeling
cushion
after
remaining
motionless
for
a
long
time
as
if
buried
in
thought
he
sought
his
wrote
a
letter
himself
addressed
it
to
his
spiritual
superior
and
left
it
upon
the
then
he
consulted
the
clock
and
a
railway
in
japanese
the
hour
was
early
the
night
windy
and
dark
he
prostrated
himself
for
a
moment
in
prayer
before
the
altar
then
hurried
out
into
the
blackness
and
reached
the
railway
exactly
in
time
to
kneel
down
in
the
middle
of
the
track
facing
the
roar
and
rush
of
the
express
from
kobe
and
in
another
moment
those
who
had
worshiped
the
strange
beauty
of
the
man
would
have
shrieked
to
see
even
by
all
that
remained
of
his
poor
earthliness
smearing
the
iron
way
the
letter
written
to
his
superior
was
found
it
contained
a
bare
statement
to
the
effect
that
feeling
his
spiritual
strength
departing
from
him
he
had
resolved
to
die
in
order
that
he
might
not
sin
the
other
letter
was
still
lying
where
he
had
left
it
on
the
floor
a
letter
written
in
that
of
which
every
syllable
is
a
little
caress
of
humility
like
all
such
letters
they
are
never
sent
through
the
post
it
contained
no
date
no
name
no
initial
and
its
envelope
bore
no
address
into
our
incomparably
harsher
english
speech
it
might
be
imperfectly
rendered
as
follows
take
such
freedom
may
be
to
assume
overmuch
yet
i
feel
that
i
must
speak
to
you
and
therefore
send
this
letter
as
for
my
lowly
self
i
have
to
say
only
that
when
first
seeing
you
in
the
period
of
the
festival
of
the
further
shore
i
began
to
think
and
that
since
then
i
have
not
even
for
a
moment
been
able
to
forget
more
and
more
each
day
i
sink
into
that
thought
of
you
and
when
i
sleep
i
dream
and
when
awaking
and
seeing
you
not
i
remember
there
was
no
truth
in
my
thoughts
of
the
night
i
can
do
nothing
but
weep
forgive
me
that
having
been
born
into
this
world
a
woman
i
should
utter
my
wish
for
the
exceeding
favor
of
being
found
not
hateful
to
one
so
high
foolish
and
without
delicacy
i
may
seem
in
allowing
my
heart
to
be
thus
tortured
by
the
thought
of
one
so
far
above
me
but
only
because
knowing
that
i
can
not
restrain
my
heart
out
of
the
depth
of
it
i
have
suffered
these
poor
words
to
come
that
i
may
write
them
with
my
unskillful
brush
and
send
them
to
you
i
pray
that
you
will
deem
me
worthy
of
pity
i
beseech
that
you
will
not
send
me
cruel
words
in
return
compassionate
me
seeing
that
this
is
but
the
overflowing
of
my
humble
feelings
deign
to
divine
and
justly
to
judge
be
it
only
with
the
least
of
kindliness
this
heart
that
in
its
great
distress
alone
so
ventures
to
address
you
each
moment
i
shall
hope
and
wait
for
some
gladdening
all
things
fortunate
from
the
to
the
beloved
august
one
this
letter
actors
in
japan
often
exercise
a
similar
fascination
upon
sensitive
girls
of
the
lower
classes
and
often
take
cruel
advantage
of
the
power
so
gained
it
is
very
rarely
indeed
that
such
fascination
can
be
exerted
by
a
priest
iii
i
called
upon
a
japanese
friend
a
buddhist
scholar
to
ask
some
questions
about
the
religious
aspects
of
the
incident
even
as
a
confession
of
human
weakness
that
suicide
appeared
to
me
a
heroism
it
did
not
so
appear
to
my
friend
he
spoke
words
of
rebuke
he
reminded
me
that
one
who
even
suggested
suicide
as
a
means
of
escape
from
sin
had
been
pronounced
by
the
buddha
a
spiritual
outcast
unfit
to
live
with
holy
men
as
for
the
dead
priest
he
had
been
one
of
those
whom
the
teacher
called
fools
only
a
fool
could
imagine
that
by
destroying
his
own
body
he
was
destroying
also
within
himself
the
sources
of
sin
but
i
protested
this
man
life
was
pure
suppose
he
sought
death
that
he
might
not
unwittingly
cause
others
to
commit
sin
my
friend
smiled
ironically
then
he
said
there
was
once
a
lady
of
japan
nobly
torn
and
very
beautiful
who
wanted
to
become
a
nun
she
went
to
a
certain
temple
and
made
her
wish
known
but
the
said
to
her
are
still
very
young
you
have
lived
the
life
of
courts
to
the
eyes
of
worldly
men
you
are
beautiful
and
because
of
your
face
temptations
to
return
to
the
pleasures
of
the
world
will
be
devised
for
you
also
this
wish
of
yours
may
be
due
to
some
momentary
sorrow
therefore
i
can
not
now
consent
to
your
request
but
she
still
pleaded
so
earnestly
that
he
deemed
it
best
to
leave
her
abruptly
there
was
a
large
hibachi
a
brazier
of
glowing
charcoal
in
the
room
where
she
found
herself
alone
she
heated
the
iron
tongs
of
the
brazier
till
they
were
red
and
with
them
horribly
pierced
and
seamed
her
face
destroying
her
beauty
forever
then
the
priest
alarmed
by
the
smell
of
the
burning
returned
in
haste
and
was
very
much
grieved
by
what
he
saw
but
she
pleaded
again
without
any
trembling
in
her
voice
i
was
beautiful
you
refused
to
take
me
will
you
take
me
now
she
was
accepted
into
the
order
and
became
a
holy
nun
well
which
was
the
wiser
that
woman
or
the
priest
you
wanted
to
praise
but
was
it
the
duty
of
the
priest
i
asked
to
disfigure
his
face
certainly
not
even
the
woman
action
would
have
been
very
unworthy
if
done
only
as
a
protection
against
temptation
of
any
sort
is
forbidden
by
the
law
of
buddha
and
she
transgressed
but
as
she
burned
her
face
only
that
she
might
be
able
to
enter
at
once
upon
the
path
and
not
because
afraid
of
being
unable
by
her
own
will
to
resist
sin
her
fault
was
a
minor
fault
on
the
other
hand
the
priest
who
took
his
own
life
committed
a
very
great
offense
he
should
have
tried
to
convert
those
who
tempted
him
this
he
was
too
weak
to
do
if
he
felt
it
impossible
to
keep
from
sinning
as
a
priest
then
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
to
return
to
the
world
and
there
try
to
follow
the
law
for
such
as
do
not
belong
to
the
order
according
to
buddhism
therefore
he
has
obtained
no
merit
i
queried
it
is
not
easy
to
imagine
that
he
has
only
by
those
ignorant
of
the
law
can
his
action
be
commended
and
by
those
knowing
the
law
what
will
be
thought
of
the
results
the
karma
of
his
act
my
friend
mused
a
little
then
he
said
thoughtfully
the
whole
truth
of
that
suicide
we
can
not
fully
know
perhaps
it
was
not
the
first
time
do
you
mean
that
in
some
former
life
also
he
may
have
tried
to
escape
from
sin
by
destroying
his
own
body
yes
or
in
many
former
lives
what
of
his
future
lives
only
a
buddha
could
answer
that
with
certain
knowledge
but
what
is
the
teaching
you
forget
that
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
know
what
was
in
the
mind
of
that
man
suppose
that
he
sought
death
only
to
escape
from
sinning
then
he
will
have
to
face
the
like
temptation
again
and
again
and
all
the
sorrow
of
it
and
all
the
pain
even
for
a
thousand
times
a
thousand
times
until
he
shall
have
learned
to
master
himself
there
is
no
escape
through
death
from
the
supreme
necessity
of
after
parting
with
my
friend
his
words
continued
to
haunt
me
and
they
haunt
me
still
they
forced
new
thoughts
about
some
theories
hazarded
in
the
first
part
of
this
paper
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
assure
myself
that
his
weird
interpretation
of
the
amatory
mystery
is
any
less
worthy
of
consideration
than
our
western
interpretations
i
have
been
wondering
whether
the
loves
that
lead
to
death
might
not
mean
much
more
than
the
ghostly
hunger
of
buried
passions
might
they
not
signify
also
the
inevitable
penalty
of
sins

he
was
born
in
a
city
of
the
interior
the
seat
of
a
daimyo
of
three
hundred
thousand
koku
where
no
foreigner
had
ever
been
the
yashiki
of
his
father
a
samurai
of
high
rank
stood
within
the
outer
fortifications
surrounding
the
prince
castle
it
was
a
spacious
yashiki
and
behind
it
and
around
it
were
landscape
gardens
one
of
which
contained
a
small
shrine
of
the
god
of
armies
forty
years
ago
there
were
many
such
homes
to
artist
eyes
the
few
still
remaining
seem
like
fairy
palaces
and
their
gardens
like
dreams
of
the
buddhist
paradise
but
sons
of
samurai
were
severely
disciplined
in
those
days
and
the
one
of
whom
i
write
had
little
time
for
dreaming
the
period
of
caresses
was
made
painfully
brief
for
him
even
before
he
was
invested
with
his
first
hakama
or
trousers
a
great
ceremony
in
that
epoch
he
was
weaned
as
far
as
possible
from
tender
influence
and
taught
to
check
the
natural
impulses
of
childish
affection
little
comrades
would
ask
him
mockingly
do
you
still
need
milk
if
they
saw
him
walking
out
with
his
mother
although
he
might
love
her
in
the
house
as
demonstratively
as
he
pleased
during
the
hours
he
could
pass
by
her
side
these
were
not
many
all
inactive
pleasures
were
severely
restricted
by
his
discipline
and
even
comforts
except
during
illness
were
not
allowed
him
almost
from
the
time
he
could
speak
he
was
enjoined
to
consider
duty
the
guiding
motive
of
life
the
first
requisite
of
conduct
pain
and
death
matters
of
no
consequence
in
the
selfish
sense
there
was
a
grimmer
side
to
this
spartan
discipline
designed
to
cultivate
a
cold
sternness
never
to
be
relaxed
during
youth
except
in
the
screened
intimacy
of
the
home
the
boys
were
inured
to
sights
of
blood
they
were
taken
to
witness
executions
they
were
expected
to
display
no
emotion
and
they
were
obliged
on
their
return
home
to
quell
any
secret
feeling
of
horror
by
eating
plentifully
of
rice
tinted
by
an
admixture
of
salted
plum
juice
even
more
difficult
things
might
be
demanded
of
a
very
young
boy
to
go
alone
at
midnight
to
the
for
example
and
bring
back
a
head
in
proof
of
courage
for
the
fear
of
the
dead
was
held
not
less
contemptible
in
a
samurai
than
the
fear
of
man
the
samurai
child
was
pledged
to
fear
nothing
in
all
such
tests
the
demeanor
exacted
was
perfect
impassiveness
any
swaggering
would
have
been
judged
quite
as
harshly
as
any
sign
of
cowardice
as
a
boy
grew
up
he
was
obliged
to
find
his
pleasures
chiefly
in
those
bodily
exercises
which
were
the
samurai
early
and
constant
preparations
for
war
archery
and
riding
wrestling
and
fencing
playmates
were
found
for
him
but
these
were
older
youths
sons
of
retainers
chosen
for
ability
to
assist
him
in
the
practice
of
martial
exercises
it
was
their
duty
also
to
teach
him
how
to
swim
to
handle
a
boat
to
develop
his
young
muscles
between
such
physical
training
and
the
study
of
the
chinese
classics
the
greater
part
of
each
day
was
divided
for
him
his
diet
though
ample
was
never
dainty
his
clothing
except
in
time
of
great
ceremony
was
light
and
coarse
and
he
was
not
allowed
the
use
of
fire
merely
to
warm
himself
while
studying
of
winter
mornings
if
his
hands
became
too
cold
to
use
the
writing
brush
he
would
be
ordered
to
plunge
them
into
icy
water
to
restore
the
circulation
and
if
his
feet
were
numbed
by
frost
he
would
be
told
to
run
about
in
the
snow
to
make
them
warm
still
more
rigid
was
his
training
in
the
special
etiquette
of
the
military
class
and
he
was
early
made
to
know
that
the
little
sword
in
his
girdle
was
neither
an
ornament
nor
a
plaything
he
was
shown
how
to
use
it
how
to
take
his
own
life
at
a
moment
notice
without
shrinking
whenever
the
code
of
his
class
might
so
order
also
in
the
matter
of
religion
the
training
of
a
samurai
boy
was
peculiar
he
was
educated
to
revere
the
ancient
gods
and
the
spirits
of
his
ancestors
he
was
well
schooled
in
the
chinese
ethics
and
he
was
taught
something
of
buddhist
philosophy
and
faith
but
he
was
likewise
taught
that
hope
of
heaven
and
fear
of
hell
were
for
the
ignorant
only
and
that
the
superior
man
should
be
influenced
in
his
conduct
by
nothing
more
selfish
than
the
love
of
right
for
its
own
sake
and
the
recognition
of
duty
as
a
universal
law
gradually
as
the
period
of
boyhood
ripened
into
youth
his
conduct
was
less
subjected
to
supervision
he
was
left
more
and
more
free
to
act
upon
his
own
judgment
but
with
full
knowledge
that
a
mistake
would
not
be
forgotten
that
a
serious
offense
would
never
be
fully
condoned
and
that
a
reprimand
was
more
to
be
dreaded
than
death
on
the
other
hand
there
were
few
moral
dangers
against
which
to
guard
him
professional
vice
was
then
strictly
banished
from
many
of
the
provincial
and
even
so
much
of
the
side
of
life
as
might
have
been
reflected
in
popular
romance
and
drama
a
young
samurai
could
know
little
about
he
was
taught
to
despise
that
common
literature
appealing
either
to
the
softer
emotions
or
the
passions
as
essentially
unmanly
reading
and
the
public
theatre
was
forbidden
to
his
class
thus
in
that
innocent
provincial
life
of
old
japan
a
young
samurai
might
grow
up
exceptionally
and
so
grew
up
the
young
samurai
concerning
whom
these
things
are
written
fearless
courteous
despising
pleasure
and
ready
at
an
instant
notice
to
give
his
life
for
love
loyalty
or
honor
but
though
already
a
warrior
in
frame
and
spirit
he
was
in
years
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
when
the
country
was
first
startled
by
the
coming
of
the
black
ships
ii
the
policy
of
iyemitsu
forbidding
any
japanese
to
leave
the
country
under
pain
of
death
had
left
the
nation
for
two
hundred
years
ignorant
of
the
outer
world
about
the
colossal
forces
gathering
beyond
seas
nothing
was
known
the
long
existence
of
the
dutch
settlement
at
nagasaki
had
in
no
wise
enlightened
japan
as
to
her
true
position
an
oriental
feudalism
of
the
sixteenth
century
menaced
by
a
western
world
three
centuries
older
accounts
of
the
real
wonders
of
that
world
would
have
sounded
to
japanese
ears
like
stories
invented
to
please
children
or
have
been
classed
with
ancient
tales
of
the
fabled
palaces
of
horai
the
advent
of
the
american
fleet
the
black
ships
as
they
were
then
called
first
awakened
the
government
to
some
knowledge
of
its
own
weakness
and
of
danger
from
afar
national
excitement
at
the
news
of
the
second
coming
of
the
black
ships
was
followed
by
consternation
at
the
discovery
that
the
shogunate
confessed
its
inability
to
cope
with
the
foreign
powers
this
could
mean
only
a
peril
greater
than
that
of
the
tartar
invasion
in
the
days
of
hojo
tokimune
when
the
people
had
prayed
to
the
gods
for
help
and
the
emperor
himself
at
ise
had
besought
the
spirits
of
his
fathers
those
prayers
had
been
answered
by
sudden
darkness
a
sea
of
thunder
and
the
coming
of
that
mighty
wind
still
called
the
wind
of
the
gods
by
which
the
fleets
of
kublai
khan
were
given
to
the
abyss
why
should
not
prayers
now
also
be
made
they
were
in
countless
homes
and
at
thousands
of
shrines
but
the
superior
ones
gave
this
time
no
answer
the
did
not
come
and
the
samurai
boy
praying
vainly
before
the
little
shrine
of
hachiman
in
his
father
garden
wondered
if
the
gods
had
lost
their
power
or
if
the
people
of
the
black
ships
were
under
the
protection
of
stronger
gods
is
that
really
the
head
of
your
father
a
prince
once
asked
of
a
samurai
boy
only
seven
years
old
the
child
at
once
realized
the
situation
the
head
set
before
him
was
not
his
father
the
daimyo
had
been
deceived
but
further
deception
was
necessary
so
the
lad
after
having
saluted
the
head
with
every
sign
of
reverential
grief
suddenly
cut
out
his
own
bowels
all
the
prince
doubts
vanished
before
that
bloody
proof
of
filial
piety
the
outlawed
father
was
able
to
make
good
his
escape
and
the
memory
of
the
child
is
still
honored
in
japanese
drama
and
poetry
samurai
women
in
some
province
at
least
could
go
to
the
public
theatre
the
men
could
not
without
committing
a
breach
of
good
manners
but
in
samurai
homes
or
within
the
grounds
of
the
yashiki
some
private
performances
of
a
particular
character
were
given
strolling
players
were
the
performers
i
know
several
charming
old
samurai
who
have
never
been
to
a
public
theatre
in
their
lives
and
refuse
all
invitations
to
witness
a
performance
they
still
obey
the
rules
of
their
samurai
education
iii
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
foreign
barbarians
were
not
to
be
driven
away
hundreds
had
come
from
the
east
as
well
as
from
the
west
and
all
possible
measures
for
their
protection
had
been
taken
and
they
had
built
queer
cities
of
their
own
upon
japanese
soil
the
government
had
even
commanded
that
western
knowledge
was
to
be
taught
in
all
schools
that
the
study
of
english
was
to
be
made
an
important
branch
of
public
education
and
that
public
education
itself
was
to
be
remodeled
upon
occidental
lines
the
government
had
also
declared
that
the
future
of
the
country
would
depend
upon
the
study
and
mastery
of
the
languages
and
the
science
of
the
foreigners
during
the
interval
then
between
such
study
and
its
successful
results
japan
would
practically
remain
under
alien
domination
the
fact
was
not
indeed
publicly
stated
in
so
many
words
but
the
signification
of
the
policy
was
unmistakable
after
the
first
violent
emotions
provoked
by
knowledge
of
the
situation
after
the
great
dismay
of
the
people
and
the
suppressed
fury
of
the
samurai
there
arose
an
intense
curiosity
regarding
the
appearance
and
character
of
those
insolent
strangers
who
had
been
able
to
obtain
what
they
wanted
by
mere
display
of
superior
force
this
general
curiosity
was
partly
satisfied
by
an
immense
production
and
distribution
of
cheap
colored
prints
picturing
the
manner
and
customs
of
the
barbarians
and
the
extraordinary
streets
of
their
settlements
caricatures
only
those
flaring
wood
prints
could
have
seemed
to
foreign
eyes
but
caricature
was
not
the
conscious
object
of
the
artist
he
tried
to
portray
foreigners
as
he
really
saw
them
and
he
saw
them
as
monsters
with
red
hair
like
shojo
and
with
noses
like
tengu
wearing
clothes
of
absurd
forms
and
colors
and
dwelling
in
structures
like
storehouses
or
prisons
sold
by
hundreds
of
thousands
throughout
the
interior
these
prints
must
have
created
many
uncanny
ideas
yet
as
attempts
to
depict
the
unfamiliar
they
were
only
innocent
one
should
be
able
to
study
those
old
drawings
in
order
to
comprehend
just
how
we
appeared
to
the
japanese
of
that
era
how
ugly
how
grotesque
how
ridiculous
the
young
samurai
of
the
town
soon
had
the
experience
of
seeing
a
real
western
foreigner
a
teacher
hired
for
them
by
the
prince
he
was
an
englishman
he
came
under
the
protection
of
an
armed
escort
and
orders
were
given
to
treat
him
as
a
person
of
distinction
he
did
not
seem
quite
so
ugly
as
the
foreigners
in
the
japanese
prints
his
hair
was
red
indeed
and
his
eyes
of
a
strange
color
but
his
face
was
not
disagreeable
he
at
once
became
and
long
remained
the
subject
of
tireless
observation
how
closely
his
every
act
was
watched
could
never
be
guessed
by
any
one
ignorant
of
the
queer
superstitions
of
the
era
concerning
ourselves
although
recognized
as
intelligent
and
formidable
creatures
occidentals
were
not
generally
regarded
as
quite
human
they
were
thought
of
as
more
closely
allied
to
animals
than
to
mankind
they
had
hairy
bodies
of
queer
shape
their
teeth
were
different
from
those
of
men
their
internal
organs
were
also
peculiar
and
their
moral
ideas
those
of
goblins
the
timidity
which
foreigners
then
inspired
not
indeed
to
the
samurai
but
to
the
common
people
was
not
a
physical
but
a
superstitious
fear
even
the
japanese
peasant
has
never
been
a
coward
but
to
know
his
feelings
in
that
time
toward
foreigners
one
must
also
know
something
of
the
ancient
beliefs
common
to
both
japan
and
china
about
animals
gifted
with
supernatural
powers
and
capable
of
assuming
human
form
about
the
existence
of
races
and
and
about
the
mythical
beings
of
the
old
goblins
and
and
bearded
ashinaga
and
tenaga
whether
depicted
by
the
illustrators
of
weird
stories
or
comically
treated
by
the
brush
of
hokusai
really
the
aspect
of
the
new
strangers
seemed
to
afford
confirmation
of
the
fables
related
by
a
certain
chinese
herodotus
and
the
clothing
they
wore
might
seem
to
have
been
devised
for
the
purpose
of
hiding
what
would
prove
them
not
human
so
the
new
english
teacher
blissfully
ignorant
of
the
fact
was
studied
surreptitiously
just
as
one
might
study
a
curious
animal
i
nevertheless
from
his
students
he
experienced
only
courtesy
they
treated
him
by
that
chinese
code
which
ordains
that
even
the
shadow
of
a
teacher
must
not
be
trodden
on
in
any
event
it
would
have
mattered
little
to
samurai
students
whether
their
teacher
were
perfectly
human
or
not
so
long
as
he
could
teach
the
hero
yoshitsune
had
been
taught
the
art
of
the
sword
by
a
tengu
beings
not
human
had
proved
themselves
scholars
and
poets
but
behind
the
mask
of
delicate
courtesy
the
habits
were
minutely
noted
and
the
ultimate
judgment
based
upon
the
comparison
of
such
observation
was
not
altogether
flattering
the
teacher
himself
could
never
have
imagined
the
comments
made
upon
him
by
his
pupils
nor
would
it
have
increased
his
peace
of
mind
while
overlooking
compositions
in
the
to
have
understood
their
conversation
see
the
color
of
his
flesh
how
soft
it
is
to
take
off
his
head
with
a
single
blow
would
be
very
easy
once
he
was
induced
to
try
their
mode
of
wrestling
just
for
fun
he
supposed
but
they
really
wanted
to
take
his
physical
measure
he
was
not
very
highly
estimated
as
an
athlete
strong
arms
he
certainly
has
one
said
but
he
does
not
know
how
to
use
his
body
while
using
his
arms
and
his
loins
are
very
weak
to
break
his

difficult
i
think
said
another
that
it
would
be
easy
to
fight
with
foreigners
with
swords
it
would
be
very
easy
responded
a
third
but
they
are
more
skilful
than
we
in
the
use
of
guns
and
cannon
we
can
learn
all
that
said
the
first
speaker
when
we
have
learned
western
military
matters
we
need
not
care
for
western
soldiers
foreigners
observed
another
are
not
hardy
like
we
are
they
soon
tire
and
they
fear
cold
all
winter
our
teacher
must
have
a
great
fire
in
his
room
to
stay
there
five
minutes
gives
me
the
headache
but
for
all
that
the
lads
were
kind
to
their
teacher
and
made
him
love
them
apish
mythological
beings
with
red
hair
delighting
in
drunkenness
mythological
beings
of
several
kinds
supposed
to
live
in
the
mountains
some
have
long
noses
there
is
a
legend
that
when
toryoko
a
great
poet
who
was
the
teacher
of
now
deified
as
tenjin
was
once
passing
the
gate
called
of
the
emperor
palace
at
kyoto
he
recited
aloud
this
single
verse
which
he
had
just
composed
clear
is
the
weather
and
fair
and
the
wind
waves
the
hair
of
young
willows
immediately
a
deep
mocking
voice
from
the
gateway
continued
the
poem
thus
melted
and
vanished
the
ice
the
waves
comb
the
locks
of
old
mosses
toryoko
looked
but
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
reaching
home
he
told
his
pupil
about
the
matter
and
repeated
the
two
compositions
praised
the
second
one
saying
truly
the
words
of
the
first
are
the
words
of
a
poet
but
the
words
of
the
second
are
the
words
of
a
demon
iv
changes
came
as
great
earthquakes
come
without
warning
the
transformation
of
daimyates
into
prefectures
the
suppression
of
the
military
class
the
reconstruction
of
the
whole
social
system
these
events
filled
the
youth
with
sadness
although
he
felt
no
difficulty
in
transferring
his
allegiance
from
prince
to
emperor
and
although
the
wealth
of
his
family
remained
unimpaired
by
the
shock
all
this
reconstruction
told
him
of
the
greatness
of
the
national
danger
and
announced
the
certain
disappearance
of
the
old
high
ideals
and
of
nearly
all
things
loved
but
he
knew
regret
was
vain
by
alone
could
the
nation
hope
to
save
its
independence
and
the
obvious
duty
of
the
patriot
was
to
recognize
necessity
and
fitly
prepare
himself
to
play
the
man
in
the
drama
of
the
future
in
the
samurai
school
he
had
learned
much
english
and
he
knew
himself
able
to
converse
with
englishmen
he
cut
his
long
hair
put
away
his
swords
and
went
to
yokohama
that
he
might
continue
his
study
of
the
language
under
more
favorable
conditions
at
yokohama
everything
at
first
seemed
to
him
both
unfamiliar
and
repellent
even
the
japanese
of
the
port
had
been
changed
by
foreign
contact
they
were
rude
and
rough
they
acted
and
spoke
as
common
people
would
not
have
dared
to
do
in
his
native
town
the
foreigners
themselves
impressed
him
still
more
disagreeably
it
was
the
period
when
new
settlers
could
assume
the
tone
of
conquerors
to
the
conquered
and
when
the
life
of
the
open
ports
was
much
less
decorous
than
now
the
new
buildings
of
brick
or
stuccoed
timber
revived
for
him
unpleasant
memories
of
the
japanese
colored
pictures
of
foreign
manners
and
customs
and
he
could
not
quickly
banish
the
fancies
of
his
boyhood
concerning
occidentals
reason
based
on
larger
knowledge
and
experience
fully
assured
him
what
they
really
were
but
to
his
emotional
life
the
intimate
sense
of
their
kindred
humanity
still
failed
to
come
is
older
than
intellectual
development
and
the
superstitions
attaching
to
are
not
easy
to
get
rid
of
his
too
was
stirred
at
times
by
ugly
things
heard
or
seen
incidents
that
filled
him
with
the
hot
impulse
of
his
fathers
to
avenge
a
cowardice
or
to
redress
a
wrong
but
he
learned
to
conquer
his
repulsions
as
obstacles
to
knowledge
it
was
the
patriot
duty
to
study
calmly
the
nature
of
his
country
foes
he
trained
himself
at
last
to
observe
the
new
life
about
him
without
prejudice
its
merits
not
less
than
its
defects
its
strength
not
less
than
its
weakness
he
found
kindness
he
found
devotion
to
ideals
ideals
not
his
own
but
which
he
knew
how
to
respect
because
they
exacted
like
the
religion
of
his
ancestors
abnegation
of
many
things
through
such
appreciation
he
learned
to
like
and
to
trust
an
aged
missionary
entirely
absorbed
in
the
work
of
educating
and
proselytizing
the
old
man
was
especially
anxious
to
convert
this
young
samurai
in
whom
aptitudes
of
no
common
order
were
discernible
and
he
spared
no
pains
to
win
the
boy
confidence
he
aided
him
in
many
ways
taught
him
something
of
french
and
german
of
greek
and
latin
and
placed
entirely
at
his
disposal
a
private
library
of
considerable
extent
the
use
of
a
foreign
library
including
works
of
history
philosophy
travel
and
fiction
was
not
a
privilege
then
easy
for
japanese
students
to
obtain
it
was
gratefully
appreciated
and
the
owner
of
the
library
found
no
difficulty
at
a
later
day
in
persuading
his
favored
and
favorite
pupil
to
read
a
part
of
the
new
testament
the
youth
expressed
surprise
at
finding
among
the
doctrines
of
the
evil
sect
ethical
precepts
like
those
of
confucius
to
the
old
missionary
he
said
this
teaching
is
not
new
to
us
but
it
is
certainly
very
good
i
shall
study
the
book
and
think
about
it
v
the
study
and
the
thinking
were
to
lead
the
young
man
much
further
than
he
had
thought
possible
after
the
recognition
of
christianity
as
a
great
religion
came
recognitions
of
another
order
and
various
imaginings
about
the
civilization
of
the
races
professing
christianity
it
then
seemed
to
many
reflective
japanese
possibly
even
to
the
keen
minds
directing
the
national
policy
that
japan
was
doomed
to
pass
altogether
under
alien
rule
there
was
hope
indeed
and
while
even
the
ghost
of
hope
remained
the
duty
for
all
was
plain
but
the
power
that
could
be
used
against
the
empire
was
irresistible
and
studying
the
enormity
of
that
power
the
young
oriental
could
not
but
ask
himself
with
a
wonder
approaching
awe
whence
and
how
it
had
been
gained
could
it
as
his
aged
teacher
averred
have
some
occult
relation
to
a
higher
religion
certainly
the
ancient
chinese
philosophy
which
declared
the
prosperity
of
peoples
proportionate
to
their
observance
of
celestial
law
and
their
obedience
to
the
teaching
of
sages
countenanced
such
a
theory
and
if
the
superior
force
of
western
civilization
really
indicated
the
superior
character
of
western
ethics
was
it
not
the
plain
duty
of
every
patriot
to
follow
that
higher
faith
and
to
strive
for
the
conversion
of
the
whole
nation
a
youth
of
that
era
educated
in
chinese
wisdom
and
necessarily
ignorant
of
the
history
of
social
evolution
in
the
west
could
never
have
imagined
that
the
very
highest
forms
of
material
progress
were
developed
chiefly
through
a
merciless
competition
out
of
all
harmony
with
christian
idealism
and
at
variance
with
every
great
system
of
ethics
even
in
the
west
unthinking
millions
imagine
some
divine
connection
between
military
power
and
christian
belief
and
utterances
are
made
in
our
pulpits
implying
divine
justification
for
political
robberies
and
heavenly
inspiration
for
the
invention
of
high
explosives
there
still
survives
among
us
the
superstition
that
races
professing
christianity
are
divinely
destined
to
rob
or
exterminate
races
holding
other
beliefs
some
men
occasionally
express
their
conviction
that
we
still
worship
thor
and
odin
the
only
difference
being
that
odin
has
become
a
mathematician
and
that
the
hammer
mjolnir
is
now
worked
by
steam
but
such
persons
are
declared
by
the
missionaries
to
be
atheists
and
men
of
shameless
lives
be
this
as
it
may
a
time
came
when
the
young
samurai
resolved
to
proclaim
himself
a
christian
despite
the
opposition
of
his
kindred
it
was
a
bold
step
but
his
early
training
had
given
him
firmness
and
he
was
not
to
be
moved
from
his
decision
even
by
the
sorrow
of
his
parents
his
rejection
of
the
ancestral
faith
would
signify
more
than
temporary
pain
for
him
it
would
mean
disinheritance
the
contempt
of
old
comrades
loss
of
rank
and
all
the
consequences
of
bitter
poverty
but
his
samurai
training
had
taught
him
to
despise
self
he
saw
what
he
believed
to
be
his
duty
as
a
patriot
and
as
a
truthseeker
and
he
followed
it
without
fear
or
regret
vi
those
who
hope
to
substitute
their
own
western
creed
in
the
room
of
one
which
they
wreck
by
the
aid
of
knowledge
borrowed
from
modern
science
do
not
imagine
that
the
arguments
used
against
the
ancient
faith
can
be
used
with
equal
force
against
the
new
unable
himself
to
reach
the
higher
levels
of
modern
thought
the
average
missionary
can
not
foresee
the
result
of
his
small
teaching
of
science
upon
an
oriental
mind
naturally
more
powerful
than
his
own
he
is
therefore
astonished
and
shocked
to
discover
that
the
more
intelligent
his
pupil
the
briefer
the
term
of
that
pupil
christianity
to
destroy
personal
faith
in
a
fine
mind
previously
satisfied
with
buddhist
cosmogony
because
innocent
of
science
is
not
extremely
difficult
but
to
substitute
in
the
same
mind
western
religious
emotions
for
oriental
presbyterian
or
baptist
dogmatisms
for
chinese
and
buddhist
ethics
is
not
possible
the
psychological
difficulties
in
the
way
are
never
recognized
by
our
modern
evangelists
in
former
ages
when
the
faith
of
the
jesuits
and
the
friars
was
not
less
superstitious
than
the
faith
they
strove
to
supplant
the
same
obstacles
existed
and
the
spanish
priest
even
while
accomplishing
marvels
by
his
immense
sincerity
and
fiery
zeal
must
have
felt
that
to
fully
realize
his
dream
he
would
need
the
sword
of
the
spanish
soldier
the
conditions
are
far
less
favorable
for
any
work
of
conversion
than
they
ever
were
in
the
sixteenth
century
education
has
been
secularized
and
remodeled
upon
a
scientific
basis
our
religions
are
being
changed
into
mere
social
recognitions
of
ethical
necessities
the
functions
of
our
clergy
are
being
gradually
transformed
into
those
of
a
moral
police
and
the
multitude
of
our
proves
no
increase
of
our
faith
but
only
the
larger
growth
of
our
respect
for
conventions
never
can
the
conventions
of
the
occident
become
those
of
the
far
east
and
never
will
foreign
missionaries
be
suffered
in
japan
to
take
the
role
of
a
police
of
morals
already
the
most
liberal
of
our
churches
those
of
broadest
culture
begin
to
recognize
the
vanity
of
missions
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
drop
old
dogmatisms
in
order
to
perceive
the
truth
thorough
education
should
be
enough
to
reveal
it
and
the
most
educated
of
nations
germany
sends
no
missionaries
to
work
in
the
interior
of
japan
a
result
of
missionary
efforts
much
more
significant
than
the
indispensable
yearly
report
of
new
conversions
has
been
the
reorganization
of
the
native
religions
and
a
recent
government
mandate
insisting
upon
the
higher
education
of
the
native
indeed
long
before
this
mandate
the
wealthier
sects
had
established
buddhist
schools
on
the
western
plan
and
the
shinshu
could
already
boast
of
its
scholars
educated
in
paris
or
at
oxford
men
whose
names
are
known
to
sanscritists
the
world
over
certainly
japan
will
need
higher
forms
of
faith
than
her
mediaeval
ones
but
these
must
be
themselves
evolved
from
the
ancient
forms
from
within
never
from
without
a
buddhism
strongly
fortified
by
western
science
will
meet
the
future
needs
of
the
race
the
young
convert
at
yokohama
proved
a
noteworthy
example
of
missionary
failures
within
a
few
years
after
having
sacrificed
a
fortune
in
order
to
become
a
christian
or
rather
the
member
of
a
foreign
religious
sect
he
publicly
renounced
the
creed
accepted
at
such
a
cost
he
had
studied
and
comprehended
the
great
minds
of
the
age
better
than
his
religious
teachers
who
could
no
longer
respond
to
the
questions
he
propounded
except
by
the
assurance
that
books
of
which
they
had
recommended
him
to
study
parts
were
dangerous
to
faith
as
wholes
but
as
they
could
not
prove
the
fallacies
alleged
to
exist
in
such
books
their
warnings
availed
nothing
he
had
been
converted
to
dogmatism
by
imperfect
reasoning
by
larger
and
deeper
reasoning
he
found
his
way
beyond
dogmatism
he
passed
from
the
church
after
an
open
declaration
that
its
tenets
were
not
based
upon
true
reason
or
fact
and
that
he
felt
himself
obliged
to
accept
the
opinions
of
men
whom
his
teachers
had
called
the
enemies
of
christianity
there
was
great
scandal
at
his
relapse
the
real
relapse
was
yet
far
away
unlike
many
with
a
similar
experience
he
knew
that
the
religious
question
had
only
receded
for
him
and
that
all
he
had
learned
was
scarcely
more
than
the
alphabet
of
what
remained
to
learn
he
had
not
lost
belief
in
the
relative
value
of
creeds
in
the
worth
of
religion
as
a
conserving
and
restraining
force
a
distorted
perception
of
one
truth
the
truth
of
a
relation
subsisting
between
civilizations
and
their
religions
had
first
deluded
him
into
the
path
that
led
to
his
conversion
chinese
philosophy
had
taught
him
that
which
modern
sociology
recognizes
in
the
law
that
societies
without
priesthoods
have
never
developed
and
buddhism
had
taught
him
that
even
delusions
the
parables
forms
and
symbols
presented
as
actualities
to
humble
minds
have
their
value
and
their
justification
in
aiding
the
development
of
human
goodness
from
such
a
point
of
view
christianity
had
lost
none
of
its
interest
for
him
and
though
doubting
what
his
teacher
had
told
him
about
the
superior
morality
of
christian
nations
not
at
all
illustrated
in
the
life
of
the
open
ports
he
desired
to
see
for
himself
the
influence
of
religion
upon
morals
in
the
occident
to
visit
european
countries
and
to
study
the
causes
of
their
development
and
the
reason
of
their
power
this
he
set
out
to
do
sooner
than
he
had
purposed
that
intellectual
quickening
which
had
made
him
a
doubter
in
religious
matters
had
made
him
also
a
freethinker
in
politics
he
brought
down
upon
himself
the
wrath
of
the
government
by
public
expressions
of
opinion
antagonistic
to
the
policy
of
the
hour
and
like
others
equally
imprudent
under
the
stimulus
of
new
ideas
he
was
obliged
to
leave
the
country
thus
began
for
him
a
series
of
wanderings
destined
to
carry
him
round
the
world
korea
first
afforded
him
a
refuge
then
china
where
he
lived
as
a
teacher
and
at
last
he
found
himself
on
board
a
steamer
bound
for
marseilles
he
had
little
money
but
he
did
not
ask
himself
how
he
was
going
to
live
in
europe
young
tall
athletic
frugal
and
inured
to
hardship
he
felt
sure
of
himself
and
he
had
letters
to
men
abroad
who
could
smooth
his
way
but
long
years
were
to
pass
before
he
could
see
his
native
land
again
vii
during
those
years
he
saw
western
civilization
as
few
japanese
ever
saw
it
for
he
wandered
through
europe
and
america
living
in
many
cities
and
toiling
in
many
capacities
sometimes
with
his
brain
oftener
with
his
hands
and
so
was
able
to
study
the
highest
and
the
lowest
the
best
and
the
worst
of
the
life
about
him
but
he
saw
with
the
eyes
of
the
far
east
and
the
ways
of
his
judgments
were
not
as
our
ways
for
even
as
the
occident
regards
the
far
east
so
does
the
far
east
regard
the
occident
only
with
this
difference
that
what
each
most
esteems
in
itself
is
least
likely
to
be
esteemed
by
the
other
and
both
are
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
and
there
never
has
been
and
never
can
be
perfect
mutual
comprehension
larger
than
all
anticipation
the
west
appeared
to
him
a
world
of
giants
and
that
which
depresses
even
the
boldest
occidental
who
finds
himself
without
means
or
friends
alone
in
a
great
city
must
often
have
depressed
the
oriental
exile
that
vague
uneasiness
aroused
by
the
sense
of
being
invisible
to
hurrying
millions
by
the
ceaseless
roar
of
traffic
drowning
voices
by
monstrosities
of
architecture
without
a
soul
by
the
dynamic
display
of
wealth
forcing
mind
and
hand
as
mere
cheap
machinery
to
the
uttermost
limits
of
the
possible
perhaps
he
saw
such
cities
as
dore
saw
london
sullen
majesty
of
arched
glooms
and
granite
deeps
opening
into
granite
deeps
beyond
range
of
vision
and
mountains
of
masonry
with
seas
of
labor
in
turmoil
at
their
base
and
monumental
spaces
displaying
the
grimness
of
ordered
power
through
centuries
of
beauty
there
was
nothing
to
make
appeal
to
him
between
those
endless
cliffs
of
stone
which
walled
out
the
sunrise
and
the
sunset
the
sky
and
the
wind
all
that
which
draws
us
to
great
cities
repelled
or
oppressed
him
even
luminous
paris
soon
filled
him
with
weariness
it
was
the
first
foreign
city
in
which
he
made
a
long
sojourn
french
art
as
reflecting
the
aesthetic
thought
of
the
most
gifted
of
european
races
surprised
him
much
but
charmed
him
not
at
all
what
surprised
him
especially
were
its
studies
of
the
nude
in
which
he
recognized
only
an
open
confession
of
the
one
human
weakness
which
next
to
disloyalty
or
cowardice
his
stoical
training
had
taught
him
to
most
despise
modern
french
literature
gave
him
other
reasons
for
astonishment
he
could
little
comprehend
the
amazing
art
of
the
the
worth
of
the
workmanship
in
itself
was
not
visible
to
him
and
if
he
could
have
been
made
to
understand
it
as
a
european
understands
he
would
have
remained
none
the
less
convinced
that
such
application
of
genius
to
production
signified
social
depravity
and
gradually
in
the
luxurious
life
of
the
capital
itself
he
found
proof
for
the
belief
suggested
to
him
by
the
art
and
the
literature
of
the
period
he
visited
the
the
theatres
the
opera
he
saw
with
the
eyes
of
an
ascetic
and
a
soldier
and
wondered
why
the
western
conception
of
the
worth
of
life
differed
so
little
from
the
conception
of
folly
and
of
effeminacy
he
saw
fashionable
balls
and
exposures
de
rigueur
intolerable
to
the
sense
of
modesty
artistically
calculated
to
suggest
what
would
cause
a
japanese
woman
to
die
of
shame
and
he
wondered
at
criticisms
he
had
heard
about
the
natural
modest
healthy
of
japanese
toiling
under
a
summer
sun
he
saw
cathedrals
and
churches
in
vast
number
and
near
to
them
the
palaces
of
vice
and
establishments
enriched
by
the
stealthy
sale
of
artistic
obscenities
he
listened
to
sermons
by
great
preachers
and
he
heard
blasphemies
against
all
faith
and
love
by
priest
haters
he
saw
the
circles
of
wealth
and
the
circles
of
poverty
and
the
abysses
underlying
both
the
restraining
influence
of
religion
he
did
not
see
that
world
had
no
faith
it
was
a
world
of
mockery
and
masquerade
and
selfishness
ruled
not
by
religion
but
by
police
a
world
into
which
it
were
not
good
that
a
man
should
be
born
england
more
sombre
more
imposing
more
formidable
furnished
him
with
other
problems
to
consider
he
studied
her
wealth
forever
growing
and
the
nightmares
of
squalor
forever
multiplying
in
the
shadow
of
it
he
saw
the
vast
ports
gorged
with
the
riches
of
a
hundred
lands
mostly
plunder
and
knew
the
english
still
like
their
forefathers
a
race
of
prey
and
thought
of
the
fate
of
her
millions
if
she
should
find
herself
for
even
a
single
month
unable
to
compel
other
races
to
feed
them
he
saw
the
harlotry
and
drunkenness
that
make
night
hideous
in
the
world
greatest
city
and
he
marveled
at
the
conventional
hypocrisy
that
pretends
not
to
see
and
at
the
religion
that
utters
thanks
for
existing
conditions
and
at
the
ignorance
that
sends
missionaries
where
they
are
not
needed
and
at
the
enormous
charities
that
help
disease
and
vice
to
propagate
their
kind
he
saw
also
the
declaration
of
a
great
englishman
who
had
traveled
in
many
countries
that
one
tenth
of
the
population
of
england
were
professional
criminals
or
paupers
and
this
in
spite
of
the
myriads
of
churches
and
the
incomparable
multiplication
of
laws
certainly
english
civilization
showed
less
than
any
other
the
pretended
power
of
that
religion
which
he
had
been
taught
to
believe
the
inspiration
of
progress
english
streets
told
him
another
story
there
were
no
such
sights
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
of
buddhist
cities
no
this
civilization
signified
a
perpetual
wicked
struggle
between
the
simple
and
the
cunning
the
feeble
and
the
strong
force
and
craft
combining
to
thrust
weakness
into
a
yawning
and
visible
hell
never
in
japan
had
there
been
even
the
sick
dream
of
such
conditions
yet
the
merely
material
and
intellectual
results
of
those
conditions
he
could
not
but
confess
to
be
astonishing
and
though
he
saw
evil
beyond
all
he
could
have
imagined
possible
he
also
saw
much
good
among
both
poor
and
rich
the
stupendous
riddle
of
it
all
the
countless
contradictions
were
above
his
powers
of
interpretation
he
liked
the
english
people
better
than
the
people
of
other
countries
he
had
visited
and
the
manners
of
the
english
gentry
impressed
him
as
not
unlike
those
of
the
japanese
samurai
behind
their
formal
coldness
he
could
discern
immense
capacities
of
friendship
and
enduring
kindness
kindness
he
experienced
more
than
once
the
depth
of
emotional
power
rarely
wasted
and
the
high
courage
that
had
won
the
dominion
of
half
a
world
but
ere
he
left
england
for
america
to
study
a
still
vaster
field
of
human
achievement
mere
differences
of
nationality
had
ceased
to
interest
him
they
were
blurred
out
of
visibility
in
his
growing
perception
of
occidental
civilization
as
one
amazing
whole
everywhere
displaying
whether
through
imperial
monarchical
or
democratic
forms
the
working
of
the
like
merciless
necessities
with
the
like
astounding
results
and
everywhere
based
on
ideas
totally
the
reverse
of
ideas
such
civilization
he
could
estimate
only
as
one
having
no
single
emotion
in
harmony
with
it
as
one
finding
nothing
to
love
while
dwelling
in
its
midst
and
nothing
to
regret
in
the
hour
of
leaving
it
forever
it
was
as
far
away
from
his
soul
as
the
life
of
another
planet
under
another
sun
but
he
could
understand
its
cost
in
terms
of
human
pain
feel
the
menace
of
its
weight
and
divine
the
prodigious
range
of
its
intellectual
power
and
he
hated
it
hated
its
tremendous
and
perfectly
calculated
mechanism
hated
its
utilitarian
stability
hated
its
conventions
its
greed
its
blind
cruelty
its
huge
hypocrisy
the
foulness
of
its
want
and
the
insolence
of
its
wealth
morally
it
was
monstrous
conventionally
it
was
brutal
depths
of
degradation
unfathomable
it
had
shown
him
but
no
ideals
equal
to
the
ideals
of
his
youth
it
was
all
one
great
wolfish
struggle
and
that
so
much
real
goodness
as
he
had
found
in
it
could
exist
seemed
to
him
scarcely
less
than
miraculous
the
real
sublimities
of
the
occident
were
intellectual
only
far
steep
cold
heights
of
pure
knowledge
below
whose
perpetual
emotional
ideals
die
surely
the
old
japanese
civilization
of
benevolence
and
duty
was
incomparably
better
in
its
comprehension
of
happiness
in
its
moral
ambitions
its
larger
faith
its
joyous
courage
its
simplicity
and
unselfishness
its
sobriety
and
contentment
western
superiority
was
not
ethical
it
lay
in
forces
of
intellect
developed
through
suffering
incalculable
and
used
for
the
destruction
of
the
weak
by
the
strong
and
nevertheless
that
western
science
whose
logic
he
knew
to
be
irrefutable
assured
him
of
the
larger
and
larger
expansion
of
the
power
of
that
civilization
as
of
an
irresistible
inevitable
measureless
inundation
of
japan
would
have
to
learn
the
new
forms
of
action
to
master
the
new
forms
of
thought
or
to
perish
utterly
there
was
no
other
alternative
and
then
the
doubt
of
all
doubts
came
to
him
the
question
which
all
the
sages
have
had
to
face
the
universe
moral
to
that
question
buddhism
had
given
the
deepest
answer
but
whether
moral
or
immoral
the
cosmic
process
as
measured
by
infinitesimal
human
emotion
one
conviction
remained
with
him
that
no
logic
could
impair
the
certainty
that
man
should
pursue
the
highest
moral
ideal
with
all
his
power
to
the
unknown
end
even
though
the
suns
in
their
courses
should
fight
against
him
the
necessities
of
japan
would
oblige
her
to
master
foreign
science
to
adopt
much
from
the
material
civilization
of
her
enemies
but
the
same
necessities
could
not
compel
her
to
cast
bodily
away
her
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
of
duty
and
of
honor
slowly
a
purpose
shaped
itself
in
his
mind
a
purpose
which
was
to
make
him
in
after
years
a
leader
and
a
teacher
to
strive
with
all
his
strength
for
the
conservation
of
all
that
was
best
in
the
ancient
life
and
to
fearlessly
oppose
further
introduction
of
anything
not
essential
to
national
or
helpful
to
national
fail
he
well
might
and
without
shame
but
he
could
hope
at
least
to
save
something
of
worth
from
the
drift
of
wreckage
the
wastefulness
of
western
life
had
impressed
him
more
than
its
greed
of
pleasure
and
its
capacity
for
pain
in
the
clean
poverty
of
his
own
land
he
saw
strength
in
her
unselfish
thrift
the
sole
chance
of
competing
with
the
occident
foreign
civilization
had
taught
him
to
as
he
could
never
otherwise
have
understood
the
worth
and
the
beauty
of
his
own
and
he
longed
for
the
hour
of
permission
to
return
to
the
country
of
his
birth
although
we
have
progressed
vastly
beyond
the
savage
state
in
intellectual
achievements
we
have
not
advanced
equally
in
morals
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
mass
of
our
populations
have
not
at
all
advanced
beyond
the
savage
code
of
morals
and
have
in
many
cases
sunk
below
it
a
deficient
morality
is
the
great
blot
of
modern
civilization
our
whole
social
and
moral
civilization
remains
in
a
state
of
barbarism
we
are
the
richest
country
in
the
world
and
yet
nearly
one
twentieth
of
our
population
are
parish
paupers
and
one
thirtieth
known
criminals
add
to
these
the
criminals
who
escape
detection
and
the
poor
who
live
mainly
or
partly
on
private
charity
which
according
to
hawkesley
expends
seven
millions
sterling
annually
in
london
alone
and
we
may
be
sure
that
more
than
one
tenth
of
our
population
are
actually
paupers
and
criminals

it
was
through
the
transparent
darkness
of
a
cloudless
april
morning
a
little
before
sunrise
that
he
saw
again
the
mountains
of
his
native
land
far
lofty
sharpening
sierras
towering
out
of
the
circle
of
an
inky
sea
behind
the
steamer
which
was
bearing
him
back
from
exile
the
horizon
was
slowly
filling
with
rosy
flame
there
were
some
foreigners
already
on
deck
eager
to
obtain
the
first
and
fairest
view
of
fuji
from
the
pacific
for
the
first
sight
of
fuji
at
dawn
is
not
to
be
forgotten
in
this
life
or
the
next
they
watched
the
long
procession
of
the
ranges
and
looked
over
the
jagged
looming
into
the
deep
night
where
stars
were
faintly
burning
still
and
they
could
not
see
fuji
ah
laughed
an
officer
they
questioned
you
are
looking
too
low
higher
up
much
higher
then
they
looked
up
up
up
into
the
heart
of
the
sky
and
saw
the
mighty
summit
pinkening
like
a
wondrous
phantom
in
the
flush
of
the
coming
day
a
spectacle
that
smote
them
dumb
swiftly
the
eternal
snow
yellowed
into
gold
then
whitened
as
the
sun
reached
out
beams
to
it
over
the
curve
of
the
world
over
the
shadowy
ranges
over
the
very
stars
it
seemed
for
the
giant
base
remained
viewless
and
the
night
fled
utterly
and
soft
blue
light
bathed
all
the
hollow
heaven
and
colors
awoke
from
sleep
and
before
the
gazers
there
opened
the
luminous
bay
of
yokohama
with
the
sacred
peak
its
base
ever
invisible
hanging
above
all
like
a
snowy
ghost
in
the
arch
of
the
infinite
day
still
in
the
wanderer
ears
the
words
rang
you
are
looking
too
low
higher
up
much
higher
making
vague
rhythm
with
an
immense
irresistible
emotion
swelling
at
his
heart
then
everything
dimmed
he
saw
neither
fuji
above
nor
the
nearing
hills
below
changing
their
vapory
blue
to
green
nor
the
crowding
of
the
ships
in
the
bay
nor
anything
of
the
modern
japan
he
saw
the
old
the
delicately
scented
with
odors
of
spring
rushed
to
him
touched
his
blood
and
startled
from
cells
of
memory
the
shades
of
all
that
he
had
once
abandoned
and
striven
to
forget
he
saw
the
faces
of
his
dead
he
knew
their
voices
over
the
graves
of
the
years
again
he
was
a
very
little
boy
in
his
father
yashiki
wandering
from
luminous
room
to
room
playing
in
sunned
spaces
where
trembled
on
the
matting
or
gazing
into
the
soft
green
dreamy
peace
of
the
landscape
garden
once
more
he
felt
the
light
touch
of
his
mother
hand
guiding
his
little
steps
to
the
place
of
morning
worship
before
the
household
shrine
before
the
tablets
of
the
ancestors
and
the
lips
of
the
man
murmured
again
with
sudden
meaning
the
simple
prayer
of
the
child
xi
in
the
twilight
of
the
gods
do
you
know
anything
about
josses
josses
yes
idols
japanese
idols
josses
something
i
answered
but
not
very
much
well
come
and
look
at
my
collection
wo
you
i
been
collecting
josses
for
twenty
years
and
i
got
some
worth
seeing
they
not
for
sale
though
except
to
the
british
museum
i
followed
the
curio
dealer
through
the
of
his
shop
and
across
a
paved
yard
into
an
unusually
large
like
all
it
was
dark
i
could
barely
discern
a
stairway
sloping
up
through
gloom
he
paused
at
the
foot
you
be
able
to
see
better
in
a
moment
he
said
i
had
this
place
built
expressly
for
them
but
now
it
is
scarcely
big
enough
they
all
in
the
second
story
go
right
up
only
be
careful
the
steps
are
bad
i
climbed
and
reached
a
sort
of
gloaming
under
a
very
high
roof
and
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
gods
in
the
dusk
of
the
great
the
spectacle
was
more
than
weird
it
was
apparitional
arhats
and
buddhas
and
bodhisattvas
and
the
shapes
of
a
mythology
older
than
they
filled
all
the
shadowy
space
not
ranked
by
hierarchies
as
in
a
temple
but
mingled
without
order
as
in
a
silent
panic
out
of
the
wilderness
of
multiple
heads
and
broken
aureoles
and
hands
uplifted
in
menace
or
in
prayer
a
shimmering
confusion
of
dusty
gold
half
lighted
by
cobwebbed
in
the
heavy
walls
i
could
at
first
discern
little
then
as
the
dimness
cleared
i
began
to
distinguish
personalities
i
saw
kwannon
of
many
forms
jizo
of
many
names
shaka
yakushi
amida
the
buddhas
and
their
disciples
they
were
very
old
and
their
art
was
not
all
of
japan
nor
of
any
one
place
or
time
there
were
shapes
from
korea
china
india
treasures
brought
over
sea
in
the
rich
days
of
the
early
buddhist
missions
some
were
seated
upon
the
of
the
apparitional
birth
some
rode
leopards
tigers
lions
or
monsters
mystical
typifying
lightning
typifying
death
one
and
sinister
and
splendid
seemed
moving
through
the
gloom
on
a
throne
of
gold
uplifted
by
a
phalanx
of
elephants
fudo
i
saw
shrouded
and
shrined
in
fire
and
riding
her
celestial
peacock
and
strangely
mingling
with
these
buddhist
visions
as
in
the
anachronism
of
a
limbo
armored
effigies
of
daimyo
and
images
of
the
chinese
sages
there
were
huge
forms
of
wrath
grasping
thunderbolts
and
rising
to
the
roof
the
like
impersonations
of
hurricane
power
the
guardians
of
temple
gates
also
there
were
forms
voluptuously
feminine
the
light
grace
of
the
limbs
folded
within
their
the
suppleness
of
the
fingers
numbering
the
numbers
of
the
good
law
were
ideals
possibly
inspired
in
some
forgotten
tune
by
the
charm
of
an
indian
shelved
against
the
naked
brickwork
above
i
could
perceive
multitudes
of
lesser
shapes
demon
figures
with
eyes
that
burned
through
the
dark
like
the
eyes
of
a
black
cat
and
figures
half
man
half
bird
winged
and
beaked
like
eagles
the
of
japanese
fancy
well
queried
the
curio
dealer
with
a
chuckle
of
satisfaction
at
my
evident
surprise
it
is
a
very
great
collection
i
responded
he
clapped
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
exclaimed
triumphantly
in
my
ear
cost
me
fifty
thousand
dollars
but
the
images
themselves
told
me
how
much
more
was
their
cost
to
forgotten
piety
notwithstanding
the
cheapness
of
artistic
labor
in
the
east
also
they
told
me
of
the
dead
millions
whose
pilgrim
feet
had
worn
hollow
the
steps
leading
to
their
shrines
of
the
buried
mothers
who
used
to
suspend
little
before
their
altars
of
the
generations
of
children
taught
to
murmur
prayers
to
them
of
the
countless
sorrows
and
hopes
confided
to
them
ghosts
of
the
worship
of
centuries
had
followed
them
into
exile
a
thin
sweet
odor
of
incense
haunted
the
dusty
place
what
would
you
call
that
asked
the
voice
of
the
curio
dealer
i
been
told
it
the
best
of
the
lot
he
pointed
to
a
figure
resting
upon
a
triple
golden
lotos
avalokitesvara
she
looketh
down
above
the
sound
of
storms
and
hate
give
way
to
her
name
fire
is
quenched
by
her
name
demons
vanish
at
the
sound
of
her
name
by
her
name
one
may
stand
firm
in
the
sky
like
a
sun
the
delicacy
of
the
limbs
the
tenderness
of
the
smile
were
dreams
of
the
indian
paradise
it
is
a
kwannon
i
made
reply
and
very
beautiful
somebody
will
have
to
pay
me
a
very
beautiful
price
for
it
he
said
with
a
shrewd
wink
it
cost
me
enough
as
a
rule
though
i
get
these
things
pretty
cheap
there
are
few
people
who
care
to
buy
them
and
they
have
to
be
sold
privately
you
know
that
gives
me
an
advantage
see
that
jizo
in
the
corner
the
big
black
fellow
what
is
it
i
answered
jizo
the
giver
of
long
life
it
must
be
very
old
well
he
said
again
taking
me
by
the
shoulder
the
man
from
whom
i
got
that
piece
was
put
in
prison
for
selling
it
to
me
then
he
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
whether
at
the
recollection
of
his
own
cleverness
in
the
transaction
or
at
the
unfortunate
simplicity
of
the
person
who
had
sold
the
statue
contrary
to
law
i
could
not
decide
afterwards
he
resumed
they
wanted
to
get
it
back
again
and
offered
me
more
than
i
had
given
for
it
but
i
held
on
i
know
everything
about
josses
but
i
do
know
what
they
are
worth
there
is
another
idol
like
that
in
the
whole
country
the
british
museum
will
be
glad
to
get
it
when
do
you
intend
to
offer
the
collection
to
the
british
museum
i
presumed
to
ask
well
i
first
want
to
get
up
a
show
he
replied
there
money
to
be
made
by
a
show
of
josses
in
london
london
people
never
saw
anything
like
this
in
their
lives
then
the
church
folks
help
that
sort
of
a
show
if
you
manage
them
properly
it
advertises
the
missions
idols
from
japan
how
do
you
like
the
baby
i
was
looking
at
a
small
image
of
a
naked
child
standing
one
tiny
hand
pointing
upward
and
the
other
downward
representing
the
buddha
newly
born
with
light
he
came
from
the
womb
as
when
the
sun
first
rises
in
the
east
upright
he
took
deliberately
seven
steps
and
the
prints
of
his
feet
upon
the
ground
remained
burning
as
seven
stars
and
he
spake
with
clearest
utterance
saying
this
birth
is
a
buddha
birth
is
not
for
me
only
this
last
time
am
i
born
for
the
salvation
of
all
on
earth
and
in
that
is
what
they
call
a
i
said
it
looks
like
bronze
bronze
it
is
he
responded
tapping
it
with
his
knuckles
to
make
the
metal
ring
the
bronze
alone
is
worth
more
than
the
price
i
paid
i
looked
at
the
four
devas
whose
heads
almost
touched
the
roof
and
thought
of
the
story
of
their
apparition
told
in
the
mahavagga
a
beautiful
night
the
four
great
kings
entered
the
holy
grove
filling
all
the
place
with
light
and
having
respectfully
saluted
the
blessed
one
they
stood
in
the
four
directions
like
four
great
how
did
you
ever
manage
to
get
those
big
figures
upstairs
i
asked
oh
hauled
them
up
we
got
a
hatchway
the
real
trouble
was
getting
them
here
by
train
it
was
the
first
railroad
trip
they
ever
made
but
look
at
these
here
they
will
make
the
sensation
of
the
show
i
looked
and
saw
two
small
wooden
images
about
three
feet
high
why
do
you
think
they
will
make
a
sensation
i
inquired
innocently
do
you
see
what
they
are
they
date
from
the
time
of
the
persecutions
devils
trampling
on
the
cross
they
were
small
temple
guardians
only
but
their
feet
rested
upon
supports
did
any
person
tell
you
these
were
devils
trampling
on
the
cross
i
made
bold
to
ask
what
else
are
they
doing
he
answered
evasively
look
at
the
crosses
under
their
feet
but
they
are
not
devils
i
insisted
and
those
were
put
under
their
feet
simply
to
give
equilibrium
he
said
nothing
but
looked
disappointed
and
i
felt
a
little
sorry
for
him
trampling
on
the
as
a
display
line
in
some
london
poster
announcing
the
arrival
of
josses
from
japan
might
certainly
have
been
relied
on
to
catch
the
public
eye
this
is
more
wonderful
i
said
pointing
to
a
beautiful
group
maya
with
the
infant
buddha
issuing
from
her
side
according
to
tradition
the
bodhisattva
was
born
from
her
right
side
it
was
the
eighth
day
of
the
fourth
that
bronze
too
he
remarked
tapping
it
bronze
josses
are
getting
rare
we
used
to
buy
them
up
and
sell
them
for
old
metal
wish
i
kept
some
of
them
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
bronzes
in
those
days
coming
in
from
the
temples
bells
and
vases
and
josses
that
was
the
time
we
tried
to
buy
the
daibutsu
at
kamakura
for
old
bronze
i
queried
yes
we
calculated
the
weight
of
the
metal
and
formed
a
syndicate
our
first
offer
was
thirty
thousand
we
could
have
made
a
big
profit
for
there
a
good
deal
of
gold
and
silver
in
that
work
the
priests
wanted
to
sell
but
the
people
let
them
it
one
of
the
world
wonders
i
said
would
you
really
have
broken
it
up
certainly
why
not
what
else
could
you
do
with
it
that
one
there
looks
just
like
a
virgin
mary
does
it
he
pointed
to
the
gilded
image
of
a
female
clasping
a
child
to
her
breast
yes
i
replied
but
it
is
kishibojin
the
goddess
who
loves
little
children
people
talk
about
idolatry
he
went
on
musingly
i
seen
things
like
many
of
these
in
roman
catholic
chapels
seems
to
me
religion
is
pretty
much
the
same
the
world
over
i
think
you
are
right
i
said
why
the
story
of
buddha
is
like
the
story
of
christ
is
it
to
some
degree
i
assented
only
he
was
crucified
i
did
not
answer
thinking
of
the
text
all
the
world
there
is
not
one
spot
even
so
large
as
a
where
he
has
not
surrendered
his
body
for
the
sake
of
then
it
suddenly
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
absolutely
true
for
the
buddha
of
the
deeper
buddhism
is
not
gautama
nor
yet
any
one
tathagata
but
simply
the
divine
in
man
chrysalides
of
the
infinite
we
all
are
each
contains
a
ghostly
buddha
and
the
millions
are
but
one
all
humanity
is
potentially
the
dreaming
through
the
ages
in
illusion
and
the
teacher
smile
will
make
beautiful
the
world
again
when
selfishness
shall
die
every
noble
sacrifice
brings
nearer
the
hour
of
his
awakening
and
who
may
justly
doubt
remembering
the
myriads
of
the
centuries
of
man
that
even
now
there
does
not
remain
one
place
on
earth
where
life
has
not
been
freely
given
for
love
or
duty
i
felt
the
curio
dealer
hand
on
my
shoulder
again
at
all
events
he
cried
in
a
cheery
tone
they
be
appreciated
in
the
british
museum
eh
i
hope
so
they
ought
to
be
then
i
fancied
them
immured
somewhere
in
that
vast
necropolis
of
dead
gods
under
the
gloom
of
a
chambered
with
forgotten
divinities
of
egypt
or
babylon
and
trembling
faintly
at
the
roar
of
london
all
to
what
end
perhaps
to
aid
another
alma
tadema
to
paint
the
beauty
of
another
vanished
civilization
perhaps
to
assist
the
illustration
of
an
english
dictionary
of
buddhism
perhaps
to
inspire
some
future
laureate
with
a
metaphor
startling
as
tennyson
figure
of
the
oiled
and
curled
assyrian
bull
assuredly
they
would
not
be
preserved
in
vain
the
thinkers
of
a
less
conventional
and
selfish
era
would
teach
new
reverence
for
them
each
eidolon
shaped
by
human
faith
remains
the
shell
of
a
truth
eternally
divine
and
even
the
shell
itself
may
hold
a
ghostly
power
the
soft
serenity
the
passionless
tenderness
of
these
buddha
faces
might
yet
give
peace
of
soul
to
a
west
weary
of
creeds
transformed
into
conventions
eager
for
the
coming
of
another
teacher
to
proclaim
have
the
same
feeling
for
the
high
as
for
the
low
for
the
moral
as
for
the
immoral
for
the
depraved
as
for
the
virtuous
for
those
holding
sectarian
views
and
false
opinions
as
for
those
whose
beliefs
are
good
and
a
name
given
to
fireproof
storehouses
in
the
open
ports
of
the
far
east
the
word
is
derived
from
the
malay

the
idea
of

a
bikkhu

i
were
i
to
ask
any
reflecting
occidental
who
had
passed
some
years
in
the
real
living
atmosphere
of
buddhism
what
fundamental
idea
especially
differentiates
oriental
modes
of
thinking
from
our
own
i
am
sure
he
would
answer
the
idea
of
it
is
this
idea
more
than
any
other
which
permeates
the
whole
mental
being
of
the
far
east
it
is
universal
as
the
wash
of
air
it
colors
every
emotion
it
influences
directly
or
indirectly
almost
every
act
its
symbols
are
perpetually
visible
even
in
details
of
artistic
decoration
and
hourly
by
day
or
night
some
echoes
of
its
language
float
uninvited
to
the
ear
the
utterances
of
the
people
their
household
sayings
their
proverbs
their
pious
or
profane
exclamations
their
confessions
of
sorrow
hope
joy
or
despair
are
all
informed
with
it
it
qualifies
equally
the
expression
of
hate
or
the
speech
of
affection
and
the
term
or
meaning
karma
as
inevitable
retribution
comes
naturally
to
every
lip
as
an
interpretation
as
a
consolation
or
as
a
reproach
the
peasant
toiling
up
some
steep
road
and
feeling
the
weight
of
his
handcart
straining
every
muscle
murmurs
patiently

ingwa
it

you
the
incapable
or
vicious
man
is
reproached
with
his
ingwa
and
the
misfortunes
of
the
wise
or
the
virtuous
are
explained
by
the
same
buddhist
word
the
confesses
his
crime
saying
that
which
i
did
i
knew
to
be
wicked
when
doing
but
my
ingwa
was
stronger

my
heart
separated
lovers

death
under
the
belief
that
their
union
in
this
life
is
banned
by
the
results
of
their
sins
in
a
former
one
and
the
victim
of
an
injustice
tries
to
allay
his
natural
anger
by
the
that
he
is
expiating
some
forgotten
fault
which
had
to
be
expiated
in
the
eternal
order
of
things
so
likewise
even

the

past

may
be
fortunate
the

begin
to
fail
talks
cheerily
of
the
impending
change
that
is
to
provide
him
with
a
fresh
young
body
and
the
expressions
signifying
the
buddhist
idea
of
necessity
no
the
last
life
resignation
recur
as
frequently
in
japanese
common
parlance
as
do
the
words
right
and
wrong
in
english
popular
speech
after
long
dwelling
in
this
psychological
medium
you
find
that
it
has
penetrated
your
own
thought
and
has
effected
therein
various
changes
all
concepts
of
life
implied
by
the
idea
of
preexistence
all
those
beliefs
which
however
sympathetically
studied
must
at
first
have
seemed
more
than
strange
to
you
finally
lose
that
curious
or
fantastic
character
with
which
novelty
once
invested
them
and
present
themselves
under
a
perfectly
normal
aspect
they
explain
so
many
things
so
well
as
even
to
look
rational
and
quite
rational
some
assuredly
are
when
measured
by
the
scientific
thought
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
to
judge
them
fairly
it
is
first
necessary
to
sweep
the
mind
clear
of
all
western
ideas
of
metempsychosis
for
there
is
no
resemblance
between
the
old
occidental
conceptions
of
soul
the
pythagorean
or
the
platonic
for
example
and
the
buddhist
conception
and
it
is
precisely
because
of
this
unlikeness
that
the
japanese
beliefs
prove
themselves
reasonable
the
profound
difference
between
western
thought
and
eastern
thought
in
this
regard
is
that
for
the
buddhist
the
conventional
soul
the
single
tenuous
tremulous
transparent
inner
man
or
ghost
does
not
exist
the
oriental
ego
is
not
individual
nor
is
it
even
a
definitely
numbered
multiple
like
the
gnostic
soul
it
is
an
aggregate
or
composite
of
inconceivable
complexity
the
concentrated
sum
of
the
creative
thinking
of
previous
lives
beyond
all
reckoning
ii
the
interpretative
power
of
buddhism
and
the
singular
accord
of
its
theories
with
the
facts
of
modern
science
appear
especially
in
that
domain
of
psychology
whereof
herbert
spencer
has
been
the
greatest
of
all
explorers
no
small
part
of
our
psychological
life
is
composed
of
feelings
which
western
theology
never
could
explain
such
are
those
which
cause
the
still
speechless
infant
to
cry
at
the
sight
of
certain
faces
or
to
smile
at
the
sight
of
others
such
are
those
instantaneous
likes
or
dislikes
experienced
on
meeting
strangers
those
repulsions
or
attractions
called
first
impressions
which
intelligent
children
are
prone
to
announce
with
alarming
frankness
despite
all
assurance
that
people
must
not
be
judged
by
appearances
a
doctrine
no
child
in
his
heart
believes
to
call
these
feelings
instinctive
or
intuitive
in
the
theological
meaning
of
instinct
or
intuition
explains
nothing
at
all
merely
cuts
off
inquiry
into
the
mystery
of
life
just
like
the
special
creation
hypothesis
the
idea
that
a
personal
impulse
or
emotion
might
be
more
than
individual
except
through
demoniacal
possession
still
seems
to
orthodoxy
a
monstrous
heresy
yet
it
is
now
certain
that
most
of
our
deeper
feelings
are
superindividual
both
those
which
we
classify
as
passional
and
those
which
we
call
sublime
the
individuality
of
the
amatory
passion
is
absolutely
denied
by
science
and
what
is
true
of
love
at
first
sight
is
also
true
of
hate
both
are
superindividual
so
likewise
are
those
vague
impulses
to
wander
which
come
and
go
with
spring
and
those
vague
depressions
experienced
in
autumn
survivals
perhaps
from
an
epoch
in
which
human
migration
followed
the
course
of
the
seasons
or
even
from
an
era
preceding
the
apparition
of
man
superindividual
also
those
emotions
felt
by
one
who
after
having
passed
the
greater
part
of
a
life
on
plain
or
prairies
first
looks
upon
a
range
of
peaks
or
the
sensations
of
some
dweller
in
the
interior
of
a
continent
when
he
first
beholds
the
ocean
and
hears
its
eternal
thunder
the
delight
always
toned
with
awe
which
the
sight
of
a
stupendous
landscape
evokes
or
that
speechless
admiration
mingled
with
melancholy
inexpressible
which
the
splendor
of
a
tropical
sunset
creates
never
can
be
interpreted
by
individual
experience
psychological
analysis
has
indeed
shown
these
emotions
to
be
prodigiously
complex
and
interwoven
with
personal
experiences
of
many
kinds
but
in
either
case
the
deeper
wave
of
feeling
is
never
individual
it
is
a
surging
up
from
that
ancestral
sea
of
life
out
of
which
we
came
to
the
same
psychological
category
possibly
belongs
likewise
a
peculiar
feeling
which
troubled
minds
long
before
the
time
of
cicero
and
troubles
them
even
more
betimes
in
our
own
generation
the
feeling
of
having
already
seen
a
place
really
visited
for
the
first
time
some
strange
air
of
familiarity
about
the
streets
of
a
foreign
town
or
the
forms
of
a
foreign
landscape
comes
to
the
mind
with
a
sort
of
soft
weird
shock
and
leaves
one
vainly
ransacking
memory
for
interpretations
occasionally
beyond
question
similar
sensations
are
actually
produced
by
the
revival
or
recombination
of
former
relations
in
consciousness
but
there
would
seem
to
be
many
which
remain
wholly
mysterious
when
we
attempt
to
explain
them
by
individual
experience
even
in
the
most
common
of
our
sensations
there
are
enigmas
never
to
be
solved
by
those
holding
the
absurd
doctrine
that
all
feeling
and
cognition
belong
to
individual
experience
and
that
the
mind
of
the
child
is
a
the
pleasure
excited
by
the
perfume
of
a
flower
by
certain
shades
of
color
by
certain
tones
of
music
the
involuntary
loathing
or
fear
aroused
by
the
first
sight
of
dangerous
or
venomous
life
even
the
nameless
terror
of
dreams
are
all
inexplicable
upon
the
how
into
the
life
of
the
race
some
of
these
sensations
are
such
as
the
pleasure
in
odors
and
in
colors
grant
allen
has
most
effectively
suggested
in
his
physiological
aesthetics
and
in
his
charming
treatise
on
the
but
long
before
these
were
written
his
teacher
the
greatest
of
all
psychologists
had
clearly
proven
that
the
was
utterly
inadequate
to
account
for
many
classes
of
psychological
phenomena
if
possible
observes
herbert
spencer
it
is
even
more
at
fault
in
respect
to
the
emotions
than
to
the
cognitions
the
doctrine
that
all
the
desires
all
the
sentiments
are
generated
by
the
experiences
of
the
individual
is
so
glaringly
at
variance
with
facts
that
i
can
not
but
wonder
how
any
one
should
ever
have
ventured
to
entertain
it
it
was
spencer
also
who
showed
us
that
words
like
instinct
intuition
have
no
true
signification
in
the
old
sense
they
must
hereafter
be
used
in
a
very
different
one
instinct
in
the
language
of
modern
psychology
means
organized
memory
and
memory
itself
is
incipient
instinct
the
sum
of
impressions
to
be
inherited
by
the
next
succeeding
individual
in
the
chain
of
life
thus
science
recognizes
inherited
memory
not
in
the
ghostly
signification
of
a
remembering
of
the
details
of
former
lives
but
as
a
minute
addition
to
psychological
life
accompanied
by
minute
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
inherited
nervous
system
the
human
brain
is
an
organized
register
of
infinitely
numerous
experiences
received
during
the
evolution
of
life
or
rather
during
the
evolution
of
that
series
of
organisms
through
which
the
human
organism
has
been
reached
the
effects
of
the
most
uniform
and
frequent
of
these
experiences
have
been
successively
bequeathed
principal
and
interest
and
have
slowly
amounted
to
that
high
intelligence
which
lies
latent
in
the
brain
of
the
infant
which
the
infant
in
exercises
and
perhaps
strengthens
or
further
complicates
and
which
with
minute
additions
it
bequeaths
to
future
generations
thus
we
have
solid
physiological
ground
for
the
idea
of
and
the
idea
of
a
multiple
ego
it
is
incontrovertible
that
in
every
individual
brain
is
looked
up
the
inherited
memory
of
the
absolutely
inconceivable
multitude
of
experiences
received
by
all
the
brains
of
which
it
is
the
descendant
but
this
scientific
assurance
of
self
in
the
past
is
uttered
in
no
materialistic
sense
science
is
the
destroyer
of
materialism
it
has
proven
matter
incomprehensible
and
it
confesses
the
mystery
of
mind
insoluble
even
while
obliged
to
postulate
an
ultimate
unit
of
sensation
out
of
the
units
of
simple
sensation
older
than
we
by
millions
of
years
have
undoubtedly
been
built
up
all
the
emotions
and
faculties
of
man
here
science
in
accord
with
buddhism
avows
the
ego
composite
and
like
buddhism
explains
the
psychical
riddles
of
the
present
by
the
psychical
experiences
of
the
past
principles
of
psychology
the
feelings
iii
to
many
persons
it
must
seem
that
the
idea
of
soul
as
an
infinite
multiple
would
render
impossible
any
idea
of
religion
in
the
western
sense
and
those
unable
to
rid
themselves
of
old
theological
conceptions
doubtless
imagine
that
even
in
buddhist
countries
and
despite
the
evidence
of
buddhist
texts
the
faith
of
the
common
people
is
really
based
upon
the
idea
of
the
soul
as
a
single
entity
but
japan
furnishes
remarkable
proof
to
the
contrary
the
uneducated
common
people
the
poorest
who
have
never
studied
buddhist
metaphysics
believe
the
self
composite
what
is
even
more
remarkable
is
that
in
the
primitive
faith
shinto
a
kindred
doctrine
exists
and
various
forms
of
the
belief
seem
to
characterize
the
thought
of
the
chinese
and
of
the
koreans
all
these
peoples
of
the
far
east
seem
to
consider
the
soul
compound
whether
in
the
buddhist
sense
or
in
the
primitive
sense
represented
by
shinto
a
sort
of
ghostly
multiplying
by
fission
or
in
the
fantastic
sense
elaborated
by
chinese
astrology
in
japan
i
have
fully
satisfied
myself
that
the
belief
is
universal
it
is
not
necessary
to
quote
here
from
the
buddhist
texts
because
the
common
or
popular
beliefs
and
not
the
philosophy
of
a
creed
can
alone
furnish
evidence
that
religious
fervor
is
compatible
and
consistent
with
the
notion
of
a
composite
soul
certainly
the
japanese
peasant
does
not
think
the
psychical
self
nearly
so
complex
a
thing
as
buddhist
philosophy
considers
it
or
as
western
science
proves
it
to
be
he
thinks
of
himself
as
the
struggle
within
him
between
impulses
good
and
evil
he
explains
as
a
conflict
between
the
various
ghostly
wills
that
make
up
his
ego
and
his
spiritual
hope
is
to
disengage
his
better
self
or
selves
from
his
worse
selves
nirvana
or
the
supreme
bliss
being
attainable
only
through
the
survival
of
the
best
within
him
thus
his
religion
appears
to
be
founded
upon
a
natural
perception
of
psychical
evolution
not
nearly
so
remote
from
scientific
thought
as
are
those
conventional
notions
of
soul
held
by
our
common
people
at
home
of
course
his
ideas
on
these
abstract
subjects
are
vague
and
unsystematized
but
their
general
character
and
tendencies
are
unmistakable
and
there
can
be
no
question
whatever
as
to
the
earnestness
of
his
faith
or
as
to
the
influence
of
that
faith
upon
his
ethical
life
wherever
belief
survives
among
the
educated
classes
the
same
ideas
obtain
definition
and
synthesis
i
may
cite
in
example
two
selections
from
compositions
written
by
students
aged
respectively
and
i
might
as
easily
cite
a
score
but
the
following
will
sufficiently
indicate
what
i
mean
nothing
is
more
foolish
than
to
declare
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
soul
is
a
compound
and
though
its
elements
be
eternal
we
know
they
can
never
twice
combine
in
exactly
the
same
way
all
compound
things
must
change
their
character
and
their
conditions
human
life
is
composite
a
combination
of
energies
make
the
soul
when
a
man
dies
his
soul
may
either
remain
unchanged
or
be
changed
according
to
that
which
it
combines
with
some
philosophers
say
the
soul
is
immortal
some
that
it
is
mortal
they
are
both
right
the
soul
is
mortal
or
immortal
according
to
the
change
of
the
combinations
composing
it
the
elementary
energies
from
which
the
soul
is
formed
are
indeed
eternal
but
the
nature
of
the
soul
is
determined
by
the
character
of
the
combinations
into
which
those
energies
enter
now
the
ideas
expressed
in
these
compositions
will
appear
to
the
western
reader
at
first
view
unmistakably
atheistic
yet
they
are
really
compatible
with
the
sincerest
and
deepest
faith
it
is
the
use
of
the
english
word
soul
not
understood
at
all
as
we
understand
it
which
creates
the
false
impression
soul
in
the
sense
used
by
the
young
writers
means
an
almost
infinite
combination
of
both
good
and
evil
tendencies
a
compound
doomed
to
disintegration
not
only
by
the
very
fact
of
its
being
a
compound
but
also
by
the
eternal
law
of
spiritual
progress
iv
that
the
idea
which
has
been
for
thousands
of
years
so
vast
a
factor
in
oriental
should
have
failed
to
develop
itself
in
the
west
till
within
our
own
day
is
sufficiently
explained
by
western
theology
still
it
would
not
be
correct
to
say
that
theology
succeeded
in
rendering
the
notion
of
absolutely
repellent
to
occidental
minds
though
christian
doctrine
holding
each
soul
specially
created
out
of
nothing
to
fit
each
new
body
permitted
no
avowed
beliefs
in
popular
recognized
a
contradiction
of
dogma
in
the
phenomena
of
heredity
in
the
same
way
while
theology
decided
animals
to
be
mere
automata
moved
by
a
sort
of
incomprehensible
machinery
called
instinct
the
people
generally
recognized
that
animals
had
reasoning
powers
the
theories
of
instinct
and
of
intuition
held
even
a
generation
ago
seem
utterly
barbarous
they
were
commonly
felt
to
be
useless
as
interpretations
but
as
dogmas
they
served
to
check
speculation
and
to
prevent
heresy
wordsworth
fidelity
and
his
marvelously
overrated
intimations
of
immortality
bear
witness
to
the
extreme
timidity
and
crudeness
of
western
notions
on
these
subjects
even
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
the
love
of
the
dog
for
his
master
is
indeed
great
beyond
all
human
estimate
but
for
reasons
wordsworth
never
dreamed
about
and
although
the
fresh
sensations
of
childhood
are
certainly
intimations
of
something
much
more
wonderful
than
wordsworth
denominational
idea
of
immortality
his
famous
stanza
concerning
them
has
been
very
justly
condemned
by
john
morley
as
nonsense
before
the
decay
of
theology
no
rational
ideas
of
psychological
inheritance
of
the
true
nature
of
instinct
or
of
the
unity
of
life
could
possibly
have
forced
their
way
to
general
recognition
but
with
the
acceptance
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
old
forms
of
thought
crumbled
new
ideas
everywhere
arose
to
take
the
place
of
dogmas
and
we
now
have
the
spectacle
of
a
general
intellectual
movement
in
directions
strangely
parallel
with
oriental
philosophy
the
unprecedented
rapidity
and
multiformity
of
scientific
progress
during
the
last
fifty
years
could
not
have
failed
to
provoke
an
equally
unprecedented
intellectual
quickening
among
the
that
the
highest
and
most
complex
organisms
have
been
developed
from
the
lowest
and
simplest
that
a
single
physical
basis
of
life
is
the
substance
of
the
whole
living
world
that
no
line
of
separation
can
be
drawn
between
the
animal
and
vegetable
that
the
difference
between
life
and
is
only
a
difference
of
degree
not
of
kind
that
matter
is
not
less
incomprehensible
than
mind
while
both
are
but
varying
manifestations
of
one
and
the
same
unknown
reality
these
have
already
become
the
commonplaces
of
the
new
philosophy
after
the
first
recognition
even
by
theology
of
physical
evolution
it
was
easy
to
predict
that
the
recognition
of
psychical
evolution
could
not
be
indefinitely
delayed
for
the
barrier
erected
by
old
dogma
to
keep
men
from
looking
backward
had
been
broken
down
and
for
the
student
of
scientific
psychology
the
idea
of
passes
out
of
the
realm
of
theory
into
the
realm
of
fact
proving
the
buddhist
explanation
of
the
universal
mystery
quite
as
plausible
as
any
other
none
but
very
hasty
thinkers
wrote
the
late
professor
huxley
will
reject
it
on
the
ground
of
inherent
absurdity
like
the
of
evolution
itself
that
of
transmigration
has
its
roots
in
the
world
of
reality
and
it
may
claim
such
support
as
the
great
argument
from
analogy
is
capable
of
supplying
now
this
support
as
given
by
professor
huxley
is
singularly
strong
it
offers
us
no
glimpse
of
a
single
soul
flitting
from
darkness
to
light
from
death
to
rebirth
through
myriads
of
millions
of
years
but
it
leaves
the
main
idea
of
almost
exactly
in
the
form
enunciated
by
the
buddha
himself
in
the
oriental
doctrine
the
psychical
personality
like
the
individual
body
is
an
aggregate
doomed
to
disintegration
by
psychical
personality
i
mean
here
that
which
distinguishes
mind
from
mind
the
me
from
the
you
that
which
we
call
self
to
buddhism
this
is
a
temporary
composite
of
illusions
what
makes
it
is
the
karma
what
reincarnates
is
the
karma
the
of
the
acts
and
thoughts
of
countless
anterior
existences
each
existences
each
one
of
which
as
an
integer
in
some
great
spiritual
system
of
addition
and
subtraction
may
affect
all
the
rest
like
a
magnetism
the
karma
is
transmitted
from
form
to
form
from
phenomenon
to
phenomenon
determining
conditions
by
combinations
the
ultimate
mystery
of
the
concentrative
and
creative
effects
of
karma
the
buddhist
acknowledges
to
be
inscrutable
but
the
cohesion
of
effects
he
declares
to
be
produced
by
tanha
the
desire
of
life
corresponding
to
what
schopenhauer
called
the
will
to
live
now
we
find
in
herbert
spencer
biology
a
curious
parallel
for
this
idea
he
explains
the
transmission
of
tendencies
and
their
variations
by
a
theory
of
polarities
polarities
of
the
physiological
unit
between
this
theory
of
polarities
and
the
buddhist
theory
of
tanha
the
difference
is
much
less
striking
than
the
resemblance
karma
or
heredity
tanha
or
polarity
are
inexplicable
as
to
their
ultimate
nature
buddhism
and
science
are
here
at
one
the
fact
worthy
of
attention
is
that
both
recognize
the
same
phenomena
under
different
names
evolution
and
ethics
ed
v
the
prodigious
complexity
of
the
methods
by
which
science
has
arrived
at
conclusions
so
strangely
in
harmony
with
the
ancient
thought
of
the
east
may
suggest
the
doubt
whether
those
conclusions
could
ever
be
made
clearly
comprehensible
to
the
mass
of
western
minds
certainly
it
would
seem
that
just
as
the
real
doctrines
of
buddhism
can
be
taught
to
the
majority
of
believers
through
forms
only
so
the
philosophy
of
science
can
be
communicated
to
the
masses
through
suggestion
only
suggestion
of
such
facts
or
arrangements
of
fact
as
must
appeal
to
any
naturally
intelligent
mind
but
the
history
of
scientific
progress
assures
the
efficiency
of
this
method
and
there
is
no
strong
reason
for
the
supposition
that
because
the
processes
of
the
higher
science
remain
above
the
mental
reach
of
the
unscientific
classes
the
conclusions
of
that
science
will
not
be
generally
accepted
the
dimensions
and
weights
of
planets
the
distances
and
the
composition
of
stars
the
law
of
gravitation
the
signification
of
heat
light
and
color
the
nature
of
sound
and
a
host
of
other
scientific
discoveries
are
familiar
to
thousands
quite
ignorant
of
the
details
of
the
methods
by
which
such
knowledge
was
obtained
again
we
have
evidence
that
every
great
progressive
movement
of
science
during
the
century
has
been
followed
by
considerable
modifications
of
popular
beliefs
already
the
churches
though
clinging
still
to
the
hypothesis
of
a
soul
have
accepted
the
main
doctrine
of
physical
evolution
and
neither
fixity
of
belief
nor
intellectual
retrogression
can
be
rationally
expected
in
the
immediate
future
further
changes
of
religious
ideas
are
to
be
looked
for
and
it
is
even
likely
that
they
will
be
effected
rapidly
rather
than
slowly
their
exact
nature
indeed
can
not
be
predicted
but
existing
intellectual
tendencies
imply
that
the
doctrine
of
psychological
evolution
must
be
accepted
though
not
at
once
so
as
to
set
any
final
limit
to
ontological
speculation
and
that
the
whole
conception
of
the
ego
will
be
eventually
transformed
through
the
consequently
developed
idea
of
vi
more
detailed
consideration
of
these
probabilities
may
be
ventured
they
will
not
perhaps
be
acknowledged
as
probabilities
by
persons
who
regard
science
as
a
destroyer
rather
than
a
modifier
but
such
thinkers
forget
that
religious
feeling
is
something
infinitely
more
profound
than
dogma
that
it
survives
all
gods
and
all
forms
of
creed
and
that
it
only
widens
and
deepens
and
gathers
power
with
intellectual
expansion
that
as
mere
doctrine
religion
will
ultimately
pass
away
is
a
conclusion
to
which
the
study
of
evolution
leads
but
that
religion
as
feeling
or
even
as
faith
in
the
unknown
power
shaping
equally
a
brain
or
a
constellation
can
ever
utterly
die
is
not
at
present
conceivable
science
wars
only
upon
erroneous
interpretations
of
phenomena
it
only
magnifies
the
cosmic
mystery
and
proves
that
everything
however
minute
is
infinitely
wonderful
and
incomprehensible
and
it
is
this
indubitable
tendency
of
science
to
broaden
beliefs
and
to
magnify
cosmic
emotion
which
justifies
the
supposition
that
future
modifications
of
western
religious
ideas
will
be
totally
unlike
any
modifications
effected
in
the
past
that
the
occidental
conception
of
self
will
orb
into
something
akin
to
the
oriental
conception
of
self
and
that
all
present
petty
metaphysical
notions
of
personality
and
individuality
as
realities
per
se
will
be
annihilated
already
the
growing
popular
comprehension
of
the
facts
of
heredity
as
science
teaches
them
indicates
the
path
by
which
some
at
least
of
these
modifications
will
be
reached
in
the
coming
contest
over
the
great
question
of
psychological
evolution
common
intelligence
will
follow
science
along
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
that
line
will
doubtless
be
the
study
of
heredity
since
the
phenomena
to
be
considered
however
in
themselves
uninterpretable
are
familiar
to
general
experience
and
afford
partial
answers
to
countless
old
enigmas
it
is
thus
quite
possible
to
imagine
a
coming
form
of
western
religion
supported
by
the
whole
power
of
synthetic
philosophy
differing
from
buddhism
mainly
in
the
greater
exactness
of
its
conceptions
holding
the
soul
as
a
composite
and
teaching
a
new
spiritual
law
resembling
the
doctrine
of
karma
an
objection
to
this
idea
will
however
immediately
present
itself
to
many
minds
such
a
modification
of
belief
it
will
be
averred
would
signify
the
sudden
conquest
and
transformation
of
feelings
by
ideas
the
world
says
herbert
spencer
is
not
governed
by
ideas
but
by
feelings
to
which
ideas
serve
only
as
guides
how
are
the
notions
of
a
change
such
as
that
supposed
to
be
reconciled
with
common
knowledge
of
existing
religious
sentiment
in
the
west
and
the
force
of
religious
emotionalism
were
the
ideas
of
and
of
the
soul
as
multiple
really
antagonistic
to
western
religious
sentiment
no
satisfactory
answer
could
be
made
but
are
they
so
antagonistic
the
idea
of
certainly
is
not
the
occidental
mind
is
already
prepared
for
it
it
is
true
that
the
notion
of
self
as
a
composite
destined
to
dissolution
may
seem
little
better
than
the
materialistic
idea
of
annihilation
at
least
to
those
still
unable
to
divest
themselves
of
the
old
habits
of
thought
nevertheless
impartial
reflection
will
show
that
there
is
no
emotional
reason
for
dreading
the
disintegration
of
the
ego
actually
though
unwittingly
it
is
for
this
very
disintegration
that
christians
and
buddhists
alike
perpetually
pray
who
has
not
often
wished
to
rid
himself
of
the
worse
parts
of
his
nature
of
tendencies
to
folly
or
to
wrong
of
impulses
to
say
or
do
unkind
things
of
all
that
lower
inheritance
which
still
clings
about
the
higher
man
and
weighs
down
his
finest
aspirations
yet
that
of
which
we
so
earnestly
desire
the
separation
the
elimination
the
death
is
not
less
surely
a
part
of
psychological
inheritance
of
veritable
self
than
are
those
younger
and
larger
faculties
which
help
to
the
realization
of
noble
ideals
rather
than
an
end
to
be
feared
the
dissolution
of
self
is
the
one
object
of
all
objects
to
which
our
efforts
should
be
turned
what
no
new
philosophy
can
forbid
us
to
hope
is
that
the
best
elements
of
self
will
thrill
on
to
seek
loftier
affinities
to
enter
into
grander
and
yet
grander
combinations
till
the
supreme
revelation
comes
and
we
discern
through
infinite
vision
through
the
vanishing
of
all
self
the
absolute
reality
for
while
we
know
that
even
the
elements
themselves
are
evolving
we
have
no
proof
that
anything
utterly
dies
that
we
are
is
the
certainty
that
we
have
been
and
will
be
we
have
survived
countless
evolutions
countless
universes
we
know
that
through
the
cosmos
all
is
law
no
chance
decides
what
units
shall
form
the
planetary
core
or
what
shall
feel
the
sun
what
shall
be
locked
in
granite
and
basalt
or
shall
multiply
in
plant
and
in
animal
so
far
as
reason
can
venture
to
infer
from
analogy
the
cosmical
history
of
every
ultimate
unit
psychological
or
physical
is
determined
just
as
surely
and
as
exactly
as
in
the
buddhist
doctrine
of
karma
vii
the
influence
of
science
will
not
be
the
only
factor
in
the
modification
of
western
religious
beliefs
oriental
philosophy
will
certainly
furnish
another
sanscrit
chinese
and
pali
scholarship
and
the
tireless
labor
of
philologists
in
all
parts
of
the
east
are
rapidly
familiarizing
europe
and
america
with
all
the
great
forms
of
oriental
thought
buddhism
is
being
studied
with
interest
throughout
the
occident
and
the
results
of
these
studies
are
yearly
showing
themselves
more
and
more
definitely
in
the
mental
products
of
the
highest
culture
the
schools
of
philosophy
are
not
more
visibly
affected
than
the
literature
of
the
period
proof
that
a
reconsideration
of
the
problem
of
the
ego
is
everywhere
forcing
itself
upon
occidental
minds
may
be
found
not
only
in
the
thoughtful
prose
of
the
time
but
even
in
its
poetry
and
its
romance
ideas
impossible
a
generation
ago
are
changing
current
thought
destroying
old
tastes
and
developing
higher
feelings
creative
art
working
under
larger
inspiration
is
telling
what
absolutely
novel
and
exquisite
sensations
what
hitherto
unimaginable
pathos
what
marvelous
deepening
of
emotional
power
may
be
gained
in
literature
with
the
recognition
of
the
idea
of
even
in
fiction
we
learn
that
we
have
been
living
in
a
hemisphere
only
that
we
have
been
thinking
but
that
we
need
a
new
faith
to
join
past
with
future
over
the
great
parallel
of
the
present
and
so
to
round
out
our
emotional
world
into
a
perfect
sphere
the
clear
conviction
that
the
self
is
multiple
however
paradoxical
the
statement
seem
is
the
absolutely
necessary
step
to
the
vaster
conviction
that
the
many
are
one
that
life
is
unity
that
there
is
no
finite
but
only
infinite
until
that
blind
pride
which
imagines
self
unique
shall
have
been
broken
down
and
the
feeling
of
self
and
of
selfishness
shall
have
been
utterly
decomposed
the
knowledge
of
the
ego
as
infinite
as
the
very
cosmos
never
can
be
reached
doubtless
the
simple
emotional
conviction
that
we
have
been
in
the
past
will
be
developed
long
before
the
intellectual
conviction
that
the
ego
as
one
is
a
fiction
of
selfishness
but
the
composite
nature
of
self
must
at
last
be
acknowledged
though
its
mystery
remain
science
postulates
a
hypothetical
psychological
unit
as
well
as
a
hypothetical
physiological
unit
but
either
postulated
entity
defies
the
uttermost
power
of
mathematical
estimate
seems
to
resolve
itself
into
pure
ghostliness
the
chemist
for
working
purposes
must
imagine
an
ultimate
atom
but
the
fact
of
which
the
imagined
atom
is
the
symbol
may
be
a
force
centre
only
nay
a
void
a
vortex
an
emptiness
as
in
buddhist
concept
is
emptiness
and
emptiness
is
form
what
is
form
that
is
emptiness
what
is
emptiness
that
is
form
perception
and
conception
name
and
knowledge
all
these
are
for
science
and
for
buddhism
alike
the
cosmos
resolves
itself
into
a
vast
phantasmagoria
a
mere
play
of
unknown
and
immeasurable
forces
buddhist
faith
however
answers
the
questions
whence
and
whither
in
its
own
fashion
and
predicts
in
every
great
cycle
of
evolution
a
period
of
spiritual
expansion
in
which
the
memory
of
former
births
returns
and
all
the
future
simultaneously
opens
before
the
vision
unveiled
even
to
the
heaven
of
heavens
science
here
remains
dumb
but
her
silence
is
the
silence
of
the
gnostics
sige
the
daughter
of
depth
and
the
mother
of
spirit
what
we
may
allow
ourselves
to
believe
with
the
full
consent
of
science
is
that
marvelous
revelations
await
us
within
recent
time
new
senses
and
powers
have
been
developed
the
sense
of
music
the
faculties
of
the
mathematician
reasonably
it
may
be
expected
that
still
higher
unimaginable
faculties
will
be
evolved
in
our
descendants
again
it
is
known
that
certain
mental
capacities
undoubtedly
inherited
develop
in
old
age
only
and
the
average
life
of
the
human
race
is
steadily
lengthening
with
increased
longevity
there
surely
may
come
into
sudden
being
through
the
unfolding
of
the
larger
future
brain
powers
not
less
wonderful
than
the
ability
to
remember
former
births
the
dreams
of
buddhism
can
scarcely
be
surpassed
because
they
touch
the
infinite
but
who
can
presume
to
say
they
never
will
be
realized
note
it
may
be
necessary
to
remind
some
of
those
kind
enough
to
read
the
foregoing
that
the
words
soul
self
ego
transmigration
heredity
although
freely
used
by
me
convey
meanings
entirely
foreign
to
buddhist
philosophy
soul
in
the
english
sense
of
the
word
does
not
exist
for
the
buddhist
self
is
an
illusion
or
rather
a
plexus
of
illusions
transmigration
as
the
passing
of
soul
from
one
body
to
another
is
expressly
denied
in
buddhist
texts
of
unquestionable
authority
it
will
therefore
be
evident
that
the
real
analogy
which
does
exist
between
the
doctrine
of
karma
and
the
scientific
facts
of
heredity
is
far
from
complete
karma
signifies
the
survival
not
of
the
same
composite
individuality
but
of
its
tendencies
which
recombine
to
form
a
new
composite
individuality
the
new
being
does
not
necessarily
take
even
a
human
form
the
karma
does
not
descend
from
parent
to
child
it
is
independent
of
the
line
of
heredity
although
physical
conditions
of
life
seem
to
depend
upon
karma
the
of
a
beggar
may
have
rebirth
in
the
body
of
a
king
that
of
a
king
in
the
body
of
a
beggar
yet
the
conditions
of
either
reincarnation
have
been
predetermined
by
the
influence
of
karma
it
will
be
asked
what
then
is
the
spiritual
element
in
each
being
that
continues
unchanged
the
spiritual
kernel
so
to
speak
within
the
shell
of
karma
the
power
that
makes
for
righteousness
if
soul
and
body
alike
are
temporary
composites
and
the
karma
itself
temporary
the
only
source
of
personality
what
is
the
worth
or
meaning
of
buddhist
doctrine
what
is
it
that
suffers
by
karma
what
is
it
that
lies
within
the
illusion
that
makes
progress
that
attains
nirvana
is
it
not
a
self
not
in
our
sense
of
the
word
the
reality
of
what
we
call
self
is
denied
by
buddhism
that
which
forms
and
dissolves
the
karma
that
which
makes
for
righteousness
that
which
reaches
nirvana
is
not
our
ego
in
our
western
sense
of
the
word
then
what
is
it
it
is
the
divine
in
each
being
it
is
called
in
japanese
the
great
there
is
no
other
true
self
the
self
wrapped
in
illusion
is
called
the
buddha
yet
unborn
as
one
in
a
womb
the
infinite
exists
potentially
in
every
being
that
is
the
reality
the
other
self
is
a
falsity
lie
a
mirage
the
doctrine
of
extinction
refers
only
to
the
extinction
of
illusions
and
those
sensations
and
feelings
and
thoughts
which
belong
to
this
life
of
the
flesh
alone
are
the
illusions
which
make
the
complex
illusive
self
by
the
total
decomposition
of
this
false
self
as
by
a
tearing
away
of
veils
the
infinite
vision
comes
there
is
no
soul
the
infinite
is
the
only
eternal
principle
in
any
being
all
the
rest
is
dream
what
remains
in
nirvana
according
to
one
school
of
buddhism
potential
identity
in
the
infinite
so
that
a
buddha
after
having
reached
nirvana
can
return
to
earth
according
to
another
identity
more
than
potential
yet
not
in
our
sense
personal
a
japanese
friend
says
i
take
a
piece
of
gold
and
say
it
is
one
but
this
means
that
it
produces
on
my
visual
organs
a
single
impression
really
in
the
multitude
of
atoms
composing
it
each
atom
is
nevertheless
distinct
and
separate
and
independent
of
every
other
atom
in
buddhahood
even
so
are
united
psychical
atoms
innumerable
they
are
one
as
to
condition
yet
each
has
its
own
independent
existence
but
in
japan
the
primitive
religion
has
so
affected
the
common
class
of
buddhist
beliefs
that
it
is
not
incorrect
to
speak
of
the
japanese
idea
of
self
it
is
only
necessary
that
the
popular
shinto
idea
be
simultaneously
considered
in
shinto
we
have
the
plainest
possible
evidence
of
the
conception
of
soul
but
this
soul
is
a
composite
not
a
mere
bundle
of
sensations
perceptions
and
volitions
like
the
but
a
number
of
souls
united
to
form
one
ghostly
personality
a
dead
ghost
may
appear
as
one
or
as
many
it
can
separate
its
units
each
of
which
remains
capable
of
a
special
independent
action
such
separation
however
appears
to
be
temporary
the
various
souls
of
the
composite
naturally
cohering
even
after
death
and
reuniting
after
any
voluntary
separation
the
vast
mass
of
the
japanese
people
are
both
buddhists
and
shintoists
but
the
primitive
beliefs
concerning
the
self
are
certainly
the
most
powerful
and
in
the
blending
of
the
two
faiths
remain
distinctly
recognizable
they
have
probably
supplied
to
common
imagination
a
natural
and
easy
explanation
of
the
difficulties
of
the
though
to
what
extent
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
be
it
also
observed
that
in
the
primitive
as
well
as
in
the
buddhist
form
of
belief
the
self
is
not
a
principle
transmitted
from
parent
to
offspring
not
an
inheritance
always
dependent
upon
physiological
descent
these
facts
will
indicate
how
wide
is
the
difference
between
eastern
ideas
and
our
own
upon
the
subject
of
the
preceding
essay
they
will
also
show
that
any
general
consideration
of
the
real
analogies
existing
between
this
strange
combination
of
beliefs
and
the
scientific
thought
of
the
nineteenth
century
could
scarcely
be
made
intelligible
by
strict
philosophical
accuracy
in
the
use
of
terms
relating
to
the
idea
of
self
indeed
there
are
no
european
words
capable
of
rendering
the
exact
meaning
of
the
buddhist
terms
belonging
to
buddhist
idealism
perhaps
it
may
be
regarded
as
illegitimate
to
wander
from
that
position
so
tersely
enunciated
by
professor
huxley
in
his
essay
on
sensation
and
the
sensiferous
organs
in
ultimate
analysis
it
appears
that
a
sensation
is
the
equivalent
in
terms
of
consciousness
for
a
mode
of
motion
of
the
matter
of
the
sensorium
but
if
inquiry
is
pushed
a
stage
further
and
the
question
is
asked
what
then
do
we
know
about
matter
and
motion
there
is
but
one
reply
possible
all
we
know
about
motion
is
that
it
is
a
name
for
certain
changes
in
the
relations
of
our
visual
tactile
and
muscular
sensations
and
all
we
know
about
matter
is
that
it
is
the
hypothetical
substance
of
physical
phenomena
assumption
of
which
is
as
pure
a
piece
of
metaphysical
speculation
as
is
that
of
a
substance
of
but
metaphysical
speculation
certainly
will
not
cease
because
of
scientific
recognition
that
ultimate
truth
is
beyond
the
utmost
possible
range
of
human
knowledge
rather
for
that
very
reason
it
will
continue
perhaps
it
will
never
wholly
cease
without
it
there
can
be
no
further
modification
of
religious
beliefs
and
without
modifications
there
can
be
no
religious
progress
in
harmony
with
scientific
thought
therefore
metaphysical
speculation
seems
to
me
not
only
justifiable
but
necessary
whether
we
accept
or
deny
a
of
mind
whether
we
imagine
thought
produced
by
the
play
of
some
unknown
element
through
the
cells
of
the
brain
as
music
is
made
by
the
play
of
wind
through
the
strings
of
a
harp
whether
we
regard
the
motion
itself
as
a
special
mode
of
vibration
inherent
in
and
peculiar
to
the
units
of
the
cerebral
structure
still
the
mystery
is
infinite
and
still
buddhism
remains
a
noble
moral
in
deep
accord
with
the
aspirations
of
mankind
and
with
the
laws
of
ethical
progression
whether
we
believe
or
disbelieve
in
the
reality
of
that
which
is
called
the
material
universe
still
the
ethical
significance
of
the
inexplicable
laws
of
heredity
of
the
transmission
of
both
racial
and
personal
tendencies
in
the
unspecialized
reproductive
cell
remains
to
justify
the
doctrine
of
karma
whatever
be
that
which
makes
consciousness
its
relation
to
all
the
past
and
to
all
the
future
is
unquestionable
nor
can
the
doctrine
of
nirvana
ever
cease
to

the

science
has
found
evidence
that
known
substance
is
not
less
a
product
of
evolution
than
mind
that
all
our
elements
have
been
evolved
out
of
one
primary
undifferentiated
form
of
matter
and
this
evidence
is
startlingly
suggestive
of
some
underlying
truth
in
the
buddhist
doctrine
of
emanation
and
illusion
the
evolution
of
all
forms
from
the
formless
of
all
material
phenomena
from
immaterial
unity
and
the
ultimate
return
of
all
into
that
state
which
is
empty
of
lusts
of
malice
of
dullness
that
state
in
which
the
excitements
of
individuality
are
known
no

which
is
therefore
designated

thirty

continually
sometimes
the
smoke
and
the
odor
come
into
my
garden
down
from
the
hills
behind
the
town
just
to
remind
me
that
the
cost
of
burning
an
adult
of
my

size
is
eighty

about
half
a

in

of
my

the
whole
length
of
a
japanese
street
with
its
rows
of
little
shops
is
visible
down
to
the
bay
out
of
various
houses
in
that
street
i
have
seen
conveyed
to
the
hospital
the
last
one
only
this
morning
my
neighbor
across
the
way
who
kept
a
porcelain
shop
he
was
removed
by
force
in
spite
of
the
tears
and
cries
of
his
family
the
sanitary
law
forbids
the
treatment
of
cholera
in
private
houses
yet
people
try
to
hide
their
sick
in
spite
of
fines
and
other
penalties
because
the
public
are
overcrowded
and
roughly
managed
and
the
patients
are
entirely
separated
from
all
who
love
them
but
the
police
are
not
often
deceived
they
soon
discover
unreported
cases
and
come
with
litters
and
coolies
it
seems
cruel
but
sanitary
law
must
be
cruel
my
neighbor
wife
followed
the
litter
crying
until
the
police
obliged
her
to
return
to
her
desolate
little
shop
it
is
now
closed
up
and
will
probably
never
be
opened
again
by
the
owners
such
tragedies
end
as
quickly
as
they
begin
the
bereaved
so
soon
as
the
law
allows
remove
their
pathetic
belongings
and
disappear
and
the
ordinary
life
of
the
street
goes
on
by
day
and
by
night
exactly
as
if
nothing
particular
had
happened
itinerant
venders
with
their
bamboo
poles
and
baskets
or
buckets
or
boxes
pass
the
empty
houses
and
utter
their
accustomed
cries
religious
processions
go
by
chanting
fragments
of
sutras
the
blind
shampooer
blows
his
melancholy
whistle
the
private
watchman
makes
his
heavy
staff
boom
upon
the
the
boy
who
sells
confectionery
still
taps
his
drum
and
sings
a
with
a
plaintive
sweet
voice
like
a
girl
and
i
i
remained
long
yet
in
the
moment
of
going
i
thought
i
had
only
just
come
and
i
still
i
think
of
the
tea
old
or
new
tea
of
uji
it
might
have
seemed
to
others
but
to
me
it
was
gyokoro
tea
of
the
beautiful
yellow
of
the
yamabuki
flower
and
i
i
am
the
you
are
the
one
who
waits
the
message
i
send
my
heart
and
you
receive
it
what
care
we
now
if
the
posts
should
fall
if
the
wires
be
broken
and
the
children
sport
as
usual
they
chase
one
another
with
screams
and
laughter
they
dance
in
chorus
they
catch
and
tie
them
to
long
strings
they
sing
burdens
of
the

cutting
off

sometimes
a
child
vanishes
but
the
survivers
continue
their
play
and
this
is
wisdom
it
costs
only
sen
to
burn
a
child
the
son
of
one
of
my
neighbors
was
burned
a
few
days
ago
the
little
stones
with
which
he
used
to
play
lie
there
in
the
sun
just
as
he
left
them
curious
this
of
stones
stones
are
the
toys
not
only
of
the
children
of
the
poor
but
of
all
children
at
one
period
of
existence
no
matter
how
well
supplied
with
other
playthings
every
japanese
child
wants
sometimes
to
play
with
stones
to
the
a
stone
is
a
marvelous
thing
and
ought
so
to
be
since
even
to
the
understanding
of
the
mathematician
there
can
be
nothing
more
wonderful
than
a
common
stone
the
tiny
urchin
suspects
the
stone
to
be
much
more
than
it
seems
which
is
an
excellent
suspicion
and
if
stupid
folk
did
not
untruthfully
tell
him
that
his
plaything
is
not
worth
thinking
about
he
would
never
tire
of
it
and
would
always
be
finding
something
new
and
extraordinary
in
it
only
a
very
great
mind
could
answer
all
a
child
questions
about
stones
according
to
popular
faith
my
neighbor
darling
is
now
playing
with
small
ghostly
stones
in
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
of
souls
wondering
perhaps
why
they
cast
no
shadows
the
true
poetry
in
the
legend
of
the
is
the
absolute
naturalness
of
its
principal
idea
the
of
that
play
which
all
little
japanese
children
play
with
stones
ii
the
seller
used
to
make
his
round
with
two
large
boxes
suspended
from
a
bamboo
pole
balanced
upon
his
shoulder
one
box
containing
stems
of
various
diameters
lengths
and
colors
together
with
tools
for
fitting
them
into
metal
pipes
and
the
other
box
containing
a
baby
his
own
baby
sometimes
i
saw
it
peeping
over
the
edge
of
the
box
and
smiling
at
the
sometimes
i
saw
it
lying
well
wrapped
up
and
fast
asleep
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
sometimes
i
saw
it
playing
with
toys
many
people
i
was
told
used
to
give
it
toys
one
of
the
toys
bore
a
curious
resemblance
to
a
mortuary
tablet
ihai
and
this
i
always
observed
in
the
box
whether
the
child
were
asleep
or
awake
the
other
day
i
discovered
that
the
seller
had
abandoned
his
bamboo
pole
and
suspended
boxes
he
was
coming
up
the
street
with
a
little
just
big
enough
to
hold
his
wares
and
his
baby
and
evidently
built
for
that
purpose
in
two
compartments
perhaps
the
baby
had
become
too
heavy
for
the
more
primitive
method
of
conveyance
above
the
cart
fluttered
a
small
white
flag
bearing
in
cursive
characters
the
legend
exchanged
and
a
brief
petition
for
honorable
help
wo
the
child
seemed
well
and
happy
and
i
again
saw
the
object
which
had
so
often
attracted
my
notice
before
it
was
now
fastened
upright
to
a
high
box
in
the
cart
facing
the
infant
bed
as
i
watched
the
cart
approaching
i
suddenly
felt
convinced
that
the
tablet
was
really
an
ihai
the
sun
shone
full
upon
it
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
conventional
buddhist
text
this
aroused
my
curiosity
and
i
asked
manyemon
to
tell
the
seller
that
we
had
a
number
of
pipes
needing
fresh
stems
which
was
true
presently
the
cartlet
drew
up
at
our
gate
and
i
went
to
look
at
it
the
child
was
not
afraid
even
of
a
foreign
face
a
pretty
boy
he
lisped
and
laughed
and
held
out
his
arms
being
evidently
used
to
petting
and
while
playing
with
him
i
looked
closely
at
the
tablet
it
was
a
shinshu
ihai
bearing
a
woman
kaimyo
or
posthumous
name
and
manyemon
translated
the
chinese
characters
for
me
and
of
good
rank
in
the
mansion
of
excellence
the
day
of
the
third
month
of
the
year
of
meantime
a
servant
had
fetched
the
pipes
which
needed
new
stems
and
i
glanced
at
the
face
of
the
artisan
as
he
worked
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
past
middle
age
with
those
worn
sympathetic
lines
about
the
mouth
dry
beds
of
old
smiles
which
give
to
so
many
japanese
faces
an
indescribable
expression
of
resigned
gentleness
presently
manyemon
began
to
ask
questions
and
when
manyemon
asks
questions
not
to
reply
is
possible
for
the
wicked
only
sometimes
behind
that
dear
innocent
old
head
i
think
i
see
the
dawning
of
an
aureole
the
aureole
of
the
bosatsu
the
seller
answered
by
telling
his
story
two
months
after
the
birth
of
their
little
boy
his
wife
had
died
in
the
last
hour
of
her
illness
she
had
said
from
what
time
i
die
till
three
full
years
be
past
i
pray
you
to
leave
the
child
always
united
with
the
shadow
of
me
never
let
him
be
separated
from
my
ihai
so
that
i
may
continue
to
care
for
him
and
to
nurse
him
since
thou
knowest
that
he
should
have
the
breast
for
three
years
this
my
last
asking
i
entreat
thee
do
not
forget
but
the
mother
being
dead
the
father
could
not
labor
as
he
had
been
wont
to
do
and
also
take
care
of
so
young
a
child
requiring
continual
attention
both
night
and
day
and
he
was
too
poor
to
hire
a
nurse
so
he
took
to
selling
as
he
could
thus
make
a
little
money
without
leaving
the
child
even
for
a
minute
alone
he
could
not
afford
to
buy
milk
but
he
had
fed
the
boy
for
more
than
a
year
with
rice
gruel
and
ame
syrup
i
said
that
the
child
looked
very
strong
and
none
the
worse
for
lack
of
milk
that
declared
manyemon
in
a
tone
of
conviction
bordering
on
reproof
is
because
the
dead
mother
nurses
him
how
should
he
want
for
milk
and
the
boy
laughed
softly
as
if
conscious
of
a
ghostly
caress

great

i
the
truth
that
in
various
unobtrusive
forms
still
survives
in
some
of
the
most
highly
civilized
countries
of
europe
is
not
so
widely
known
as
to
preclude
the
idea
that
any
race
actually
practicing
so
primitive
a
cult
must
necessarily
remain
in
the
primitive
stage
of
religious
thought
critics
of
japan
have
pronounced
this
hasty
judgment
and
have
professed
themselves
unable
to
reconcile
the
facts
of
her
scientific
progress
and
the
success
of
her
advanced
educational
system
with
the
continuance
of
her
how
can
the
beliefs
of
shinto
coexist
with
the
knowledge
of
modern
science
how
can
the
men
who
win
distinction
as
scientific
specialists
still
respect
the
household
shrine
or
do
reverence
before
the
shinto
can
all
this
mean
more
than
the
ordered
conservation
of
forms
after
the
departure
of
faith
is
it
not
certain
that
with
the
further
progress
of
education
shinto
even
as
ceremonialism
must
cease
to
exist
those
who
put
such
questions
appear
to
forget
that
similar
questions
might
be
asked
about
the
continuance
of
any
western
faith
and
similar
doubts
expressed
as
to
the
possibility
of
its
survival
for
another
century
really
the
doctrines
of
shinto
are
not
in
the
least
degree
more
irreconcilable
with
modern
science
than
are
the
doctrines
of
orthodox
christianity
examined
with
perfect
impartiality
i
would
even
venture
to
say
that
they
are
less
irreconcilable
in
more
respects
than
one
they
conflict
less
with
our
human
ideas
of
justice
and
like
the
buddhist
doctrine
of
karma
they
offer
some
very
striking
analogies
with
the
scientific
facts
of
heredity
analogies
which
prove
shinto
to
contain
an
element
of
truth
as
profound
as
any
single
element
of
truth
in
any
of
the
world
great
religions
stated
in
the
simplest
possible
form
the
peculiar
element
of
truth
in
shinto
is
the
belief
that
the
world
of
the
living
is
directly
governed
by
the
world
of
the
dead
that
every
impulse
or
act
of
man
is
the
work
of
a
god
and
that
all
the
dead
become
gods
are
the
basic
ideas
of
the
cult
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
the
term
kami
although
translated
by
the
term
deity
divinity
or
god
has
really
no
such
meaning
as
that
which
belongs
to
the
english
words
it
has
not
even
the
meaning
of
those
words
as
referring
to
the
antique
beliefs
of
greece
and
rome
it
signifies
that
which
is
above
superior
upper
eminent
in
the
sense
in
the
religious
sense
it
signifies
a
human
spirit
having
obtained
supernatural
power
after
death
the
dead
are
the
powers
above
the
upper
ones
the
kami
we
have
here
a
conception
resembling
very
strongly
the
modern
spiritualistic
notion
of
ghosts
only
that
the
shinto
idea
is
in
no
true
sense
democratic
the
kami
are
ghosts
of
greatly
varying
dignity
and
power
belonging
to
spiritual
hierarchies
like
the
hierarchies
of
ancient
japanese
society
although
essentially
superior
to
the
living
in
certain
respects
the
living
are
nevertheless
able
to
give
them
pleasure
or
displeasure
to
gratify
or
to
offend
them
even
sometimes
to
ameliorate
their
spiritual
condition
wherefore
posthumous
honors
are
never
mockeries
but
realities
to
the
japanese
mind
during
the
present
year
for
example
several
distinguished
statesmen
and
soldiers
were
raised
to
higher
rank
immediately
after
their
death
and
i
read
only
the
other
day
in
the
official
gazette
that
his
majesty
has
been
pleased
to
posthumously
confer
the
second
class
of
the
order
of
the
rising
sun
upon
baron
yamane
who
lately
died
in
formosa
such
imperial
acts
must
not
be
regarded
only
as
formalities
intended
to
honor
the
memory
of
brave
and
patriotic
men
neither
should
they
be
thought
of
as
intended
merely
to
confer
distinction
upon
the
family
of
the
dead
they
are
essentially
of
shinto
and
exemplify
that
intimate
sense
of
relation
between
the
visible
and
invisible
worlds
which
is
the
special
religious
characteristic
of
japan
among
all
civilized
countries
to
japanese
thought
the
dead
are
not
less
real
than
the
living
they
take
part
in
the
daily
life
of
the
people
sharing
the
humblest
sorrows
and
the
humblest
joys
they
attend
the
family
repasts
watch
over
the
of
the
household
assist
and
rejoice
in
the
prosperity
of
their
descendants
they
are
present
at
the
public
pageants
at
all
the
sacred
festivals
of
shinto
at
the
military
games
and
at
all
the
entertainments
especially
provided
for
them
and
they
are
universally
thought
of
as
finding
pleasure
in
the
offerings
made
to
them
or
the
honors
conferred
upon
them
for
the
purpose
of
this
little
essay
it
will
be
sufficient
to
consider
the
kami
as
the
spirits
of
the
dead
without
making
any
attempt
to
distinguish
such
kami
from
those
primal
deities
believed
to
have
created
the
land
with
this
general
interpretation
of
the
term
kami
we
return
then
to
the
great
shinto
idea
that
all
the
dead
still
dwell
in
the
world
and
rule
it
influencing
not
only
the
thoughts
and
the
acts
of
men
but
the
conditions
of
nature
they
direct
wrote
motowori
the
changes
of
the
seasons
the
wind
and
the
rain
the
good
and
the
bad
fortunes
of
states
and
of
individual
men
they
are
in
short
the
viewless
forces
behind
all
phenomena
written
in
september
ii
the
most
interesting
of
this
ancient
spiritualism
is
that
which
explains
the
impulses
and
acts
of
men
as
due
to
the
influence
of
the
dead
this
hypothesis
no
modern
thinker
can
declare
irrational
since
it
can
claim
justification
from
the
scientific
doctrine
of
psychological
evolution
according
to
which
each
living
brain
represents
the
structural
work
of
innumerable
dead
lives
each
character
a
more
or
less
imperfectly
balanced
sum
of
countless
dead
experiences
with
good
and
evil
unless
we
deny
psychological
heredity
we
can
not
honestly
deny
that
our
impulses
and
feelings
and
the
higher
capacities
evolved
through
the
feelings
have
literally
been
shaped
by
the
dead
and
bequeathed
to
us
by
the
dead
and
even
that
the
general
direction
of
our
mental
activities
has
been
determined
by
the
power
of
the
special
tendencies
bequeathed
to
us
in
such
a
sense
the
dead
are
indeed
our
kami
and
all
our
actions
are
truly
influenced
by
them
figuratively
we
may
say
that
every
mind
is
a
world
of
ghosts
ghosts
incomparably
more
numerous
than
the
acknowledged
millions
of
the
higher
shinto
kami
and
that
the
spectral
population
of
one
grain
of
more
than
realizes
the
wildest
fancies
of
the
medieval
schoolmen
about
the
number
of
angels
able
to
stand
on
the
point
of
a
needle
scientifically
we
know
that
within
one
tiny
living
cell
may
be
stored
up
the
whole
life
of
a
race
the
sum
of
all
the
past
sensation
of
millions
of
years
perhaps
even
who
knows
of
millions
of
dead
planets
but
devils
would
not
be
inferior
to
angels
in
the
mere
power
of
congregating
upon
the
point
of
a
needle
what
of
bad
men
and
of
bad
acts
in
this
theory
of
shinto
motowori
made
answer
whenever
anything
goes
wrong
in
the
world
it
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
action
of
the
evil
gods
called
the
gods
of
crookedness
whose
power
is
so
great
that
the
and
the
are
sometimes
powerless
to
restrain
them
much
less
are
human
beings
always
able
to
resist
their
influence
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked
and
the
misfortunes
of
the
good
which
seem
opposed
to
ordinary
justice
are
thus
explained
all
bad
acts
are
due
to
the
influence
of
evil
deities
and
evil
men
may
become
evil
kami
there
are
no
in
this
simplest
of
cults
nothing
complicated
or
hard
to
be
understood
it
is
not
certain
that
all
men
guilty
of
bad
actions
necessarily
become
gods
of
crookedness
for
reasons
hereafter
to
be
seen
but
all
men
good
or
bad
become
kami
or
influences
and
all
evil
acts
are
the
results
of
evil
influences
now
this
teaching
is
in
accord
with
certain
facts
of
heredity
our
best
faculties
are
certainly
bequests
from
the
best
of
our
ancestors
our
evil
qualities
are
inherited
from
natures
in
which
evil
or
that
which
we
now
call
evil
once
predominated
the
ethical
knowledge
evolved
within
us
by
civilization
demands
that
we
strengthen
the
high
powers
bequeathed
us
by
the
best
experience
of
our
dead
and
diminish
the
force
of
the
baser
tendencies
we
inherit
we
are
under
obligation
to
reverence
and
to
obey
our
good
kami
and
to
strive
against
our
gods
of
crookedness
the
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
both
is
old
as
human
reason
in
some
form
or
other
the
doctrine
of
evil
and
of
good
spirits
in
personal
attendance
upon
every
soul
is
common
to
most
of
the
great
religions
our
own
mediaeval
faith
developed
the
idea
to
a
degree
which
must
leave
an
impress
on
our
language
for
all
time
yet
the
faith
in
guardian
angels
and
tempting
demons
evolutionarily
represents
only
the
development
of
a
cult
once
simple
as
the
religion
of
the
kami
and
this
theory
of
mediaeval
faith
is
likewise
pregnant
with
truth
the
form
that
whispered
good
into
the
right
ear
the
black
shape
that
murmured
evil
into
the
left
do
not
indeed
walk
beside
the
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
they
dwell
within
his
brain
and
he
knows
their
voices
and
feels
their
urging
as
well
and
as
often
as
did
his
ancestors
of
the
middle
ages
the
modern
ethical
objection
to
shinto
is
that
both
good
and
evil
kami
are
to
be
respected
just
as
the
mikado
worshiped
the
gods
of
heaven
and
of
earth
so
his
people
prayed
to
the
good
gods
in
order
to
obtain
blessings
and
performed
rites
in
honor
of
the
bad
gods
to
avert
their
displeasure
as
there
are
bad
as
well
as
good
gods
it
is
necessary
to
propitiate
them
with
offerings
of
agreeable
food
with
the
playing
of
harps
and
the
blowing
of
flutes
with
singing
and
dancing
and
with
whatever
else
is
likely
to
put
them
in
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
modern
japan
the
evil
kami
appear
to
receive
few
offerings
or
honors
notwithstanding
this
express
declaration
that
they
are
to
be
propitiated
but
it
will
now
be
obvious
why
the
early
missionaries
characterized
such
a
cult
as
although
to
shinto
imagination
the
idea
of
a
devil
in
the
western
meaning
of
the
word
never
took
shape
the
seeming
weakness
of
the
doctrine
is
in
the
teaching
that
evil
spirits
are
not
to
be
warred
upon
a
teaching
essentially
repellent
to
roman
catholic
feeling
but
between
the
evil
spirits
of
christian
and
of
shinto
belief
there
is
a
vast
difference
the
evil
kami
is
only
the
ghost
of
a
dead
man
and
is
not
believed
to
be
altogether
evil
since
propitiation
is
possible
the
conception
of
absolute
unmixed
evil
is
not
of
the
far
east
absolute
evil
is
certainly
foreign
to
human
nature
and
therefore
impossible
in
human
ghosts
the
evil
kami
are
not
devils
they
are
simply
ghosts
who
influence
the
passions
of
men
and
only
in
this
sense
the
deities
of
the
passions
now
shinto
is
of
all
religions
the
most
natural
and
therefore
in
certain
respects
the
most
rational
it
does
not
consider
the
passions
necessarily
evil
in
themselves
but
evil
only
according
to
cause
conditions
and
degrees
of
their
indulgence
being
ghosts
the
gods
are
altogether
human
having
the
various
good
and
bad
qualities
of
men
in
varying
proportions
the
majority
are
good
and
the
sum
of
the
influence
of
all
is
toward
good
rather
than
evil
to
appreciate
the
rationality
of
this
view
requires
a
tolerably
high
opinion
of
mankind
such
an
opinion
as
the
conditions
of
the
old
society
of
japan
might
have
justified
no
pessimist
could
profess
pure
shintoism
the
doctrine
is
optimistic
and
whoever
has
a
generous
faith
in
humanity
will
have
no
fault
to
find
with
the
absence
of
the
idea
of
implacable
evil
from
its
teaching
now
it
is
just
in
the
recognition
of
the
necessity
for
propitiating
the
evil
ghosts
that
the
ethically
rational
character
of
shinto
reveals
itself
ancient
experience
and
modern
knowledge
unite
in
warning
us
against
the
deadly
error
of
trying
to
extirpate
or
to
paralyze
certain
tendencies
in
human
nature
tendencies
which
if
morbidly
cultivated
or
freed
from
all
restraint
lead
to
folly
to
crime
and
to
countless
social
evils
the
animal
passions
the
impulses
antedate
human
society
and
are
the
accessories
to
nearly
all
crimes
committed
against
it
but
they
can
not
be
killed
and
they
can
not
be
safely
starved
any
attempt
to
extirpate
them
would
signify
also
an
effort
to
destroy
some
of
the
very
highest
emotional
faculties
with
which
they
remain
inseparably
blended
the
primitive
impulses
can
not
even
be
numbed
save
at
the
cost
of
intellectual
and
emotional
powers
which
give
to
human
life
all
its
beauty
and
all
its
tenderness
but
which
are
nevertheless
deeply
rooted
in
the
archaic
soil
of
passion
the
highest
in
us
had
its
beginnings
in
the
lowest
asceticism
by
warring
against
the
natural
feelings
has
created
monsters
theological
legislation
irrationally
directed
against
human
weaknesses
has
only
aggravated
social
disorders
and
laws
against
pleasure
have
only
provoked
debaucheries
the
history
of
morals
teaches
very
plainly
indeed
that
our
bad
kami
require
some
propitiation
the
passions
still
remain
more
powerful
than
the
reason
in
man
because
they
are
incomparably
older
because
they
were
once
to
they
made
that
primal
stratum
of
consciousness
out
of
which
the
nobler
sentiments
have
slowly
grown
never
can
they
be
suffered
to
rule
but
woe
to
whosoever
would
deny
their
immemorial
rights
i
am
considering
only
the
pure
shinto
belief
as
expounded
by
shinto
scholars
but
it
may
be
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
that
both
buddhism
and
shintoism
are
blended
in
japan
not
only
with
each
other
but
with
chinese
ideas
of
various
kinds
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
pure
shinto
ideas
now
exist
in
their
original
form
in
popular
belief
we
are
not
quite
clear
as
to
the
doctrine
of
multiple
souls
in
shinto
whether
the
psychical
combination
was
originally
thought
of
as
dissolved
by
death
my
own
opinion
the
result
of
investigation
in
different
parts
of
japan
is
that
the
multiple
soul
was
formerly
believed
to
remain
multiple
after
death
motowori
translated
by
satow
iii
out
of
these
primitive
but
as
may
now
be
perceived
not
irrational
beliefs
about
the
dead
there
have
been
evolved
moral
sentiments
unknown
to
western
civilization
these
are
well
worth
considering
as
they
will
prove
in
harmony
with
the
most
advanced
conception
of
ethics
and
especially
with
that
immense
though
yet
indefinite
expansion
of
the
sense
of
duty
which
has
followed
upon
the
understanding
of
evolution
i
do
not
know
that
we
have
any
reason
to
congratulate
ourselves
upon
the
absence
from
our
lives
of
the
sentiments
in
question
i
am
even
inclined
to
think
that
we
may
yet
find
it
morally
necessary
to
cultivate
sentiments
of
the
same
kind
one
of
the
surprises
of
our
future
will
certainly
be
a
return
to
beliefs
and
ideas
long
ago
abandoned
upon
the
mere
assumption
that
they
contained
no
truth
belief
still
called
barbarous
pagan
mediaeval
by
those
who
condemn
them
out
of
traditional
habit
year
after
year
the
researches
of
science
afford
us
new
proof
that
the
savage
the
barbarian
the
idolater
the
monk
each
and
all
have
arrived
by
different
paths
as
near
to
some
one
point
of
eternal
truth
as
any
thinker
of
the
nineteenth
century
we
are
now
learning
also
that
the
theories
of
the
astrologers
and
of
the
alchemists
were
but
partially
not
totally
wrong
we
have
reason
even
to
suppose
that
no
dream
of
the
invisible
world
has
ever
been
dreamed
that
no
hypothesis
of
the
unseen
has
ever
been
imagined
which
future
science
will
not
prove
to
have
contained
some
germ
of
reality
foremost
among
the
moral
sentiments
of
shinto
is
that
of
loving
gratitude
to
the
past
a
sentiment
having
no
real
correspondence
in
our
own
emotional
life
we
know
our
past
better
than
the
japanese
know
theirs
we
have
myriads
of
books
recording
or
considering
its
every
incident
and
condition
but
we
can
not
in
any
sense
be
said
to
love
it
or
to
feel
grateful
to
it
critical
recognitions
of
its
merits
and
of
its
defects
some
rare
enthusiasms
excited
by
its
beauties
many
strong
denunciations
of
its
mistakes
these
represent
the
sum
of
our
thoughts
and
feelings
about
it
the
attitude
of
our
scholarship
in
reviewing
it
is
necessarily
cold
that
of
our
art
often
more
than
generous
that
of
our
religion
condemnatory
for
the
most
part
whatever
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
study
it
our
attention
is
mainly
directed
to
the
work
of
the
dead
either
the
visible
work
that
makes
our
hearts
beat
a
little
faster
than
usual
while
looking
at
it
or
the
results
of
their
thoughts
and
deeds
in
relation
to
the
society
of
their
time
of
past
humanity
as
unity
of
the
millions
as
real
kindred
we
either
think
not
at
all
or
think
only
with
the
same
sort
of
curiosity
that
we
give
to
the
subject
of
extinct
races
we
do
indeed
find
interest
in
the
record
of
some
individual
lives
that
have
left
large
marks
in
history
our
emotions
re
stirred
by
the
memories
of
great
captains
statesmen
discoverers
reformers
but
only
because
the
magnitude
of
that
which
they
accomplished
appeals
to
our
own
ambitions
desires
egotisms
and
not
at
all
to
our
altruistic
sentiments
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
the
nameless
dead
to
whom
we
owe
most
we
do
not
trouble
ourselves
about
we
feel
no
gratitude
no
love
to
them
we
even
find
it
difficult
to
persuade
ourselves
that
the
love
of
ancestors
can
possibly
be
a
real
powerful
penetrating
religious
emotion
in
any
form
of
human
society
which
it
certainly
is
in
japan
the
mere
idea
is
utterly
foreign
to
our
ways
of
thinking
feeling
acting
a
partial
reason
for
this
of
course
is
that
we
have
no
common
faith
in
the
existence
of
an
active
spiritual
relation
between
our
ancestors
and
ourselves
if
we
happen
to
be
irreligious
we
do
not
believe
in
ghosts
if
we
are
profoundly
religious
we
think
of
the
dead
as
removed
from
us
by
judgment
as
absolutely
separated
from
us
during
the
period
of
our
lives
it
is
true
that
among
the
peasantry
of
roman
catholic
countries
there
still
exists
a
belief
that
the
dead
are
permitted
to
return
to
earth
once
a
year
on
the
night
of
all
souls
but
even
according
to
this
belief
they
are
not
considered
as
related
to
the
living
by
any
stronger
bond
than
memory
and
they
are
thought
of
as
our
collections
of
bear
witness
rather
with
fear
than
love
in
japan
the
feeling
toward
the
dead
is
utterly
different
it
is
a
feeling
of
grateful
and
reverential
love
it
is
probably
the
most
profound
and
powerful
of
the
emotions
of
the
race
that
which
especially
directs
national
life
and
shapes
national
character
patriotism
belongs
to
it
filial
piety
depends
upon
it
family
love
is
rooted
in
it
loyalty
is
based
upon
it
the
soldier
who
to
make
a
path
for
his
comrades
through
the
battle
deliberately
flings
away
his
life
with
a
shout
of
manzai
the
son
or
daughter
who
unmurmuring
sacrifices
all
the
happiness
of
existence
for
the
sake
perhaps
of
an
undeserving
or
even
cruel
parent
the
partisan
who
gives
up
friends
family
and
fortune
rather
than
break
the
verbal
promise
made
in
other
years
to
a
now
master
the
wife
who
ceremoniously
robes
herself
in
white
utters
a
prayer
and
thrusts
a
sword
into
her
throat
to
atone
for
a
wrong
done
to
strangers
by
her
husband
all
these
obey
the
will
and
hear
the
approval
of
invisible
witnesses
even
among
the
skeptical
students
of
the
new
generation
this
feeling
survives
many
wrecks
of
faith
and
the
old
sentiments
are
still
uttered
never
must
we
cause
shame
to
our
ancestors
it
is
our
duty
to
give
honor
to
our
ancestors
during
my
former
engagement
as
a
teacher
of
english
it
happened
more
than
once
that
ignorance
of
the
real
meaning
behind
such
phrases
prompted
me
to
change
them
in
written
composition
i
would
suggest
for
example
that
the
expression
to
do
honor
to
the
memory
of
our
ancestors
was
more
correct
than
the
phrase
given
i
remember
one
day
even
attempting
to
explain
why
we
ought
not
to
speak
of
ancestors
exactly
as
if
they
were
living
parents
perhaps
my
pupils
suspected
me
of
trying
to
meddle
with
their
beliefs
for
the
japanese
never
think
of
an
ancestor
as
having
become
only
a
memory
their
dead
are
alive
were
there
suddenly
to
arise
within
us
the
absolute
certainty
that
our
dead
are
still
with
us
seeing
every
act
knowing
our
every
thought
hearing
each
word
we
utter
able
to
feel
sympathy
with
us
or
anger
against
us
able
to
help
us
and
delighted
to
receive
our
help
able
to
love
us
and
greatly
needing
our
love
it
is
quite
certain
that
our
conceptions
of
life
and
duty
would
be
vastly
changed
we
should
have
to
recognize
our
obligations
to
the
past
in
a
very
solemn
way
now
with
the
man
of
the
far
east
the
constant
presence
of
the
dead
has
been
a
matter
of
conviction
for
thousands
of
years
he
speaks
to
them
daily
he
tries
to
give
them
happiness
and
unless
a
professional
criminal
he
never
quite
forgets
his
duty
towards
them
no
one
says
hirata
who
constantly
discharges
that
duty
will
ever
be
disrespectful
to
the
gods
or
to
his
living
parents
such
a
man
will
also
be
loyal
to
his
friends
and
kind
and
gentle
with
his
wife
and
children
for
the
essence
of
this
devotion
is
in
truth
filial
piety
and
it
is
in
this
sentiment
that
the
secret
of
much
strange
feeling
in
japanese
character
must
be
sought
far
more
foreign
to
our
world
of
sentiment
than
the
splendid
courage
with
which
death
is
faced
or
the
equanimity
with
which
the
most
trying
sacrifices
are
made
is
the
simple
deep
emotion
of
the
boy
who
in
the
presence
of
a
shinto
shrine
never
seen
before
suddenly
feels
the
tears
spring
to
his
eyes
he
is
conscious
in
that
moment
of
what
we
never
emotionally
recognize
the
prodigious
debt
of
the
present
to
the
past
and
the
duty
of
love
to
the
dead
iv
if
we
think
a
little
about
our
position
as
debtors
and
our
way
of
accepting
that
position
one
striking
difference
between
western
and
moral
sentiment
will
become
manifest
there
is
nothing
more
awful
than
the
mere
fact
of
life
as
mystery
when
that
fact
first
rushes
fully
into
consciousness
out
of
unknown
darkness
we
rise
a
moment
into
look
about
us
rejoice
and
suffer
pass
on
the
vibration
of
our
being
to
other
beings
and
fall
back
again
into
darkness
so
a
wave
rises
catches
the
light
transmits
its
motion
and
sinks
back
into
sea
so
a
plant
ascends
from
clay
unfolds
its
leaves
to
light
and
air
flowers
seeds
and
becomes
clay
again
only
the
wave
has
no
knowledge
the
plant
has
no
perceptions
each
human
life
seems
no
more
than
a
parabolic
curve
of
motion
out
of
earth
and
back
to
earth
but
in
that
brief
interval
of
change
it
perceives
the
universe
the
awfulness
of
the
phenomenon
is
that
nobody
knows
anything
about
it
no
mortal
can
explain
this
most
common
yet
moat
incomprehensible
of
all
facts
life
in
itself
yet
every
mortal
who
can
think
has
been
obliged
betimes
to
think
about
it
in
relation
to
self
i
come
out
of
mystery
i
see
the
sky
and
the
land
men
and
women
and
their
works
and
i
know
that
i
must
return
to
mystery
and
merely
what
this
means
not
even
the
greatest
of
philosophers
not
even
herbert
spencer
can
tell
me
we
are
all
of
us
riddles
to
ourselves
and
riddles
to
each
other
and
space
and
motion
and
time
are
riddles
and
matter
is
a
riddle
about
the
before
and
the
after
neither
the
nor
the
dead
have
any
message
for
us
the
child
is
dumb
the
skull
only
grins
nature
has
no
consolation
for
us
out
of
her
formlessness
issue
forms
which
return
to
formlessness
that
is
all
the
plant
becomes
clay
the
clay
becomes
a
plant
when
the
plant
turns
to
clay
what
becomes
of
the
vibration
which
was
its
life
does
it
go
on
existing
viewlessly
like
the
forces
that
shape
spectres
of
frondage
in
the

of

all
crouching

the

the
future
to
devour
lives
yet
unborn
but
millions
have
been
answered
we
are
now
able
to
exist
without
perpetual
horror
because
of
the
relative
knowledge
that
guides
us
the
knowledge
won
out
of
the
jaws
of
destruction
all
our
knowledge
is
bequeathed
knowledge
the
dead
have
left
us
record
of
all
they
were
able
to
learn
about
themselves
and
the
world
about
the
laws
of
death
and
life
about
things
to
be
acquired
and
things
to
be
avoided
about
ways
of
making
existence
less
painful
than
nature
willed
it
about
right
and
wrong
and
sorrow
and
happiness
about
the
error
of
selfishness
the
wisdom
of
kindness
the
obligation
of
sacrifice
they
left
us
information
of
everything
they
could
find
out
concerning
climates
and
seasons
and
places
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
the
motions
and
the
composition
of
the
universe
they
bequeathed
us
also
their
delusions
which
long
served
the
good
purpose
of
saving
us
from
falling
into
greater
ones
they
left
us
the
story
of
their
errors
and
efforts
their
triumphs
and
failures
their
pains
and
joys
their
loves
and
hates
for
warning
or
example
they
expected
our
sympathy
because
they
toiled
with
the
kindest
wishes
and
hopes
for
us
and
because
they
made
our
world
they
cleared
the
land
they
extirpated
monsters
they
tamed
and
taught
the
animals
most
useful
to
us
mother
of
kullervo
awoke
within
her
tomb
and
from
the
deeps
of
the
dust
she
cried
to
him
have
left
thee
the
dog
tied
to
a
tree
that
thou
mayest
go
with
him
to
the
chase
they
domesticated
likewise
the
useful
trees
and
plants
and
they
discovered
the
places
and
the
powers
of
the
metals
later
they
created
all
that
we
call
civilization
trusting
us
to
correct
such
mistakes
as
they
could
not
help
making
the
sum
of
their
toil
is
incalculable
and
all
that
they
have
given
us
ought
surely
to
be
very
sacred
very
precious
if
only
by
reason
of
the
infinite
pain
and
thought
which
it
cost
yet
what
occidental
dreams
of
saying
daily
like
the
shinto
believer
forefathers
of
the
generations
and
of
our
families
and
of
our
kindred
unto
you
the
founders
of
our
homes
we
utter
the
gladness
of
our
none
it
is
not
only
because
we
think
the
dead
can
not
hear
but
because
we
have
not
been
trained
for
generations
to
exercise
our
powers
of
sympathetic
mental
representation
except
within
a
very
narrow
circle
the
family
circle
the
occidental
family
circle
is
a
very
small
affair
indeed
compared
with
the
oriental
family
circle
in
this
nineteenth
century
the
occidental
family
is
almost
disintegrated
it
practically
means
little
more
than
husband
wife
and
children
well
under
age
the
oriental
family
means
not
only
parents
and
their
but
grandparents
and
their
kindred
and
and
all
the
dead
behind
them
this
idea
of
the
family
cultivates
sympathetic
representation
to
such
a
degree
that
the
range
of
the
emotion
belonging
to
such
representation
may
extend
as
in
japan
to
many
groups
and
of
living
families
and
even
in
time
of
national
peril
to
the
whole
nation
as
one
great
family
a
feeling
much
deeper
than
what
we
call
patriotism
as
a
religious
emotion
the
feeling
is
infinitely
extended
to
all
the
past
the
blended
sense
of
love
of
loyalty
and
of
gratitude
is
not
less
real
though
necessarily
more
vague
than
the
feeling
to
living
kindred
in
the
west
after
the
destruction
of
antique
society
no
such
feeling
could
remain
the
beliefs
that
condemned
the
ancients
to
hell
and
forbade
the
praise
of
their
works
the
doctrine
that
trained
us
to
return
thanks
for
everything
to
the
god
of
the
hebrews
created
habits
of
thought
and
habits
of
thoughtlessness
both
inimical
to
every
feeling
of
gratitude
to
the
past
then
with
the
decay
of
theology
and
the
dawn
of
larger
knowledge
came
the
teaching
that
the
dead
had
no
choice
in
their
work
they
had
obeyed
necessity
and
we
had
only
received
from
them
of
necessity
the
results
of
necessity
and
we
still
fail
to
recognize
that
the
necessity
itself
ought
to
compel
our
sympathies
with
those
who
obeyed
it
and
that
its
bequeathed
results
are
as
pathetic
as
they
are
precious
such
thoughts
rarely
occur
to
us
even
in
regard
to
the
work
of
the
living
who
serve
us
we
consider
the
cost
of
a
thing
purchased
or
obtained
to
ourselves
about
its
cost
in
effort
to
the
producer
we
do
not
allow
ourselves
to
think
indeed
we
should
be
laughed
at
for
any
exhibition
of
conscience
on
the
subject
and
our
equal
insensibility
to
the
pathetic
meaning
of
the
work
of
the
past
and
to
that
of
the
work
of
the
present
largely
explains
the
wastefulness
of
our
civilization
the
reckless
consumption
by
luxury
of
the
labor
of
years
in
the
pleasure
of
an
hour
the
inhumanity
of
the
thousands
of
unthinking
rich
each
of
whom
dissipates
yearly
in
the
gratification
of
totally
unnecessary
wants
the
price
of
a
hundred
human
lives
the
cannibals
of
civilization
are
unconsciously
more
cruel
than
those
of
savagery
and
require
much
more
flesh
the
deeper
humanity
the
cosmic
emotion
of
humanity
is
essentially
the
enemy
of
useless
luxury
and
essentially
opposed
to
any
form
of
society
which
places
no
restraints
upon
the
gratifications
of
sense
or
the
pleasures
of
egotism
in
the
far
east
on
the
other
hand
the
moral
duty
of
simplicity
of
life
has
been
taught
from
very
ancient
times
because
had
developed
and
cultivated
this
cosmic
emotion
of
humanity
which
we
lack
but
which
we
shall
certainly
be
obliged
to
acquire
at
a
later
day
simply
to
save
our
selves
from
extermination
two
sayings
of
iyeyasu
exemplify
the
oriental
sentiment
when
virtually
master
of
the
empire
this
greatest
of
japanese
soldiers
and
statesmen
was
seen
one
day
cleaning
and
smoothing
with
his
own
hands
an
old
dusty
pair
of
silk
hakama
or
trousers
what
you
see
me
do
he
said
to
a
retainer
i
am
not
doing
because
i
think
of
the
worth
of
the
garment
in
itself
but
because
i
think
of
what
it
needed
to
produce
it
it
is
the
result
of
the
toil
of
a
poor
woman
and
that
is
why
i
value
it
we
do
not
think
while
using
things
of
the
time
and
effort
required
to
make
them
then
our
want
of
consideration
puts
us
on
a
level
with
the
again
in
the
days
of
his
greatest
wealth
we
hear
of
him
rebuking
his
wife
for
wishing
to
furnish
him
too
often
with
new
clothing
when
i
think
he
protested
of
the
multitudes
around
me
and
of
the
generations
to
come
after
me
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
be
very
sparing
for
their
sake
of
the
goods
in
my
possession
nor
has
this
spirit
of
simplicity
yet
departed
from
japan
even
the
emperor
and
empress
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
apartments
continue
to
live
as
simply
as
their
subjects
and
devote
most
of
their
revenue
to
the
alleviation
of
public
distress
kalevala
rune
v
it
is
through
the
teachings
of
evolution
that
there
will
ultimately
be
developed
in
the
west
a
moral
recognition
of
duty
to
the
past
like
that
which
created
in
the
far
east
for
even
whoever
has
mastered
the
first
principles
of
the
new
philosophy
can
not
look
at
the
commonest
product
of
man
handiwork
without
perceiving
something
of
its
evolutional
history
the
most
ordinary
utensil
will
appear
to
him
not
the
mere
product
of
individual
capacity
on
the
part
of
carpenter
or
potter
smith
or
cutler
but
the
product
of
experiment
continued
through
thousands
of
years
with
methods
with
materials
and
with
forms
nor
will
it
be
possible
for
him
to
consider
the
vast
time
and
toil
necessitated
in
the
evolution
of
any
mechanical
appliance
and
yet
experience
no
generous
sentiment
coming
generations
must
think
of
the
material
bequests
of
the
past
in
relation
to
dead
humanity
but
in
the
development
of
this
cosmic
emotion
of
humanity
a
much
more
powerful
factor
than
recognition
of
our
material
indebtedness
to
the
past
will
be
the
recognition
of
our
psychical
indebtedness
for
we
owe
to
the
dead
our
immaterial
world
also
the
world
that
lives
within
us
the
world
of
all
that
is
lovable
in
impulse
emotion
thought
whosoever
understands
scientifically
what
human
goodness
is
and
the
terrible
cost
of
making
it
can
find
in
the
commonest
phases
of
the
humblest
lives
that
beauty
which
is
divine
and
can
feel
that
in
one
sense
our
dead
are
truly
gods
so
long
as
we
supposed
the
woman
soul
one
in
itself
a
something
specially
created
to
fit
one
particular
physical
being
the
beauty
and
the
wonder
of
could
never
be
fully
revealed
to
us
but
with
deeper
knowledge
we
must
perceive
that
the
inherited
love
of
myriads
of
millions
of
dead
mothers
has
been
treasured
up
in
one
life
that
only
thus
can
be
interpreted
the
infinite
sweetness
of
the
speech
which
the
infant
hears
the
infinite
tenderness
of
the
look
of
caress
which
meets
its
gaze
unhappy
the
mortal
who
has
not
known
these
yet
what
mortal
can
adequately
speak
of
them
truly
is
divine
for
everything
by
human
recognition
called
divine
is
summed
up
in
that
love
and
every
woman
uttering
and
transmitting
its
highest
expression
is
more
than
the
mother
of
man
she
is
the
needless
to
speak
here
about
the
ghostliness
of
first
love
sexual
love
which
is
illusion
because
the
passion
and
the
beauty
of
the
dead
revive
in
it
to
dazzle
to
delude
and
to
bewitch
it
is
very
very
wonderful
but
it
is
not
all
good
because
it
is
not
all
true
the
real
charm
of
woman
in
herself
is
that
which
comes
later
when
all
the
illusions
fade
away
to
reveal
a
reality
lovelier
than
any
illusion
which
has
been
evolving
behind
the
of
them
what
is
the
divine
magic
of
the
woman
thus
perceived
only
the
affection
the
sweetness
the
faith
the
unselfishness
the
intuitions
of
millions
of
buried
hearts
all
live
again
throb
anew
in
every
fresh
warm
beat
of
her
own
certain
amazing
faculties
exhibited
in
the
highest
social
life
tell
in
another
way
the
story
of
soul
structure
built
up
by
dead
lives
wonderful
is
the
man
who
can
really
be
all
things
to
all
men
or
the
woman
who
can
make
herself
twenty
fifty
a
hundred
different
women
comprehending
all
penetrating
all
unerring
to
estimate
all
others
seeming
to
have
no
individual
self
but
only
selves
innumerable
able
to
meet
each
varying
personality
with
a
soul
exactly
toned
to
the
tone
of
that
to
be
encountered
rare
these
characters
are
but
not
so
rare
that
the
traveler
is
unlikely
to
meet
one
or
two
of
them
in
any
cultivated
society
which
he
has
a
chance
of
studying
they
are
essentially
multiple
beings
so
visibly
multiple
that
even
those
who
think
of
the
ego
as
single
have
to
describe
them
as
highly
complex
nevertheless
this
manifestation
of
forty
or
fifty
different
characters
in
the
same
person
is
a
phenomenon
so
remarkable
especially
remarkable
because
it
is
commonly
manifested
in
youth
long
before
relative
experience
could
possibly
account
for
it
that
i
can
not
but
wonder
how
few
persons
frankly
realize
its
signification
so
likewise
with
what
have
been
termed
the
intuitions
of
some
forms
of
genius
particularly
those
which
relate
to
the
representation
of
the
emotions
a
shakespeare
would
always
remain
incomprehensible
on
the
ancient
taine
attempted
to
explain
him
by
the
phrase
a
perfect
imagination
and
the
phrase
reaches
far
in
the
truth
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
a
perfect
imagination
enormous
multiplicity
of
countless
past
existences
revived
in
one
nothing
else
can
explain
it
it
is
not
however
in
the
world
of
pure
intellect
that
the
story
of
psychical
complexity
is
most
admirable
it
is
in
the
world
which
speaks
to
our
simplest
emotions
of
love
honor
sympathy
heroism
but
by
such
a
theory
some
critic
may
observe
the
source
of
impulses
to
heroism
is
also
the
source
of
the
impulses
that
people
jails
both
are
of
the
dead
this
is
true
we
inherited
evil
as
well
as
good
being
composites
only
still
evolving
still
becoming
we
inherit
imperfections
but
the
survival
of
the
fittest
in
impulses
is
certainly
proven
by
the
average
moral
condition
of
humanity
using
the
word
fittest
in
its
ethical
sense
in
spite
of
all
the
misery
and
vice
and
crime
nowhere
so
terribly
developed
as
under
our
own
christian
civilization
the
fact
must
be
patent
to
any
one
who
has
lived
much
traveled
much
and
thought
much
that
the
mass
of
humanity
is
good
and
therefore
that
the
vast
majority
of
impulses
bequeathed
us
by
past
humanity
is
good
also
it
is
certain
that
the
more
normal
a
social
condition
the
better
its
humanity
through
all
the
past
the
good
kami
have
always
managed
to
keep
the
bad
kami
from
controlling
the
world
and
with
the
acceptation
of
this
truth
our
future
ideas
of
wrong
and
of
right
must
take
immense
expansion
just
as
a
heroism
or
any
act
of
pure
goodness
for
a
noble
end
must
assume
a
preciousness
heretofore
unsuspected
so
a
real
crime
must
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
crime
less
against
the
existing
individual
or
society
than
against
the
sum
of
human
experience
and
the
whole
past
struggle
of
ethical
aspiration
real
goodness
will
therefore
be
more
prized
and
real
crime
less
leniently
judged
and
the
early
shinto
teaching
that
no
code
of
ethics
is
necessary
that
the
right
rule
of
human
conduct
can
always
be
known
by
consulting
the
heart
is
a
teaching
which
will
doubtless
be
accepted
by
a
more
perfect
humanity
than
that
of
the
present
vi
evolution
the
reader
may
say
does
indeed
show
through
its
doctrine
of
heredity
that
the
living
are
in
one
sense
really
controlled
by
the
dead
but
it
also
shows
that
the
dead
are
within
us
not
without
us
they
are
part
of
us
there
is
no
proof
that
they
have
any
existence
which
is
not
our
own
gratitude
to
the
past
would
therefore
be
gratitude
to
ourselves
love
of
the
dead
would
be
so
that
your
attempt
at
analogy
ends
in
the
absurd
no
in
its
primitive
form
may
be
a
symbol
only
of
truth
it
may
be
an
index
or
foreshadowing
only
of
the
new
moral
duty
which
larger
knowledge
must
force
upon
as
the
duty
of
reverence
and
obedience
to
the
sacrificial
past
of
human
ethical
experience
but
it
may
also
be
much
more
the
facts
of
heredity
can
never
afford
but
half
an
explanation
of
the
facts
of
psychology
a
plant
produces
ten
twenty
a
hundred
plants
without
yielding
up
its
own
life
in
the
process
an
animal
gives
birth
to
many
young
yet
lives
on
with
all
its
physical
capacities
and
its
small
powers
of
thought
undiminished
children
are
born
and
the
parents
survive
them
inherited
the
mental
life
certainly
is
not
less
than
the
physical
yet
the
reproductive
cells
the
least
specialized
of
all
cells
whether
in
plant
or
in
animal
never
take
away
but
only
repeat
the
parental
being
continually
multiplying
each
conveys
and
transmits
the
whole
experience
of
a
race
yet
leaves
the
whole
experience
of
the
race
behind
it
here
is
the
marvel
inexplicable
the
of
physical
and
psychical
being
life
after
life
thrown
off
from
the
parent
life
each
to
become
complete
and
reproductive
were
all
the
parental
life
given
to
the
offspring
heredity
might
be
said
to
favor
the
doctrine
of
materialism
but
like
the
deities
of
hindoo
legend
the
self
multiplies
and
still
remains
the
same
with
full
capacities
for
continued
multiplication
shinto
has
its
doctrine
of
souls
multiplying
by
fission
but
the
facts
of
psychological
emanation
are
infinitely
more
wonderful
than
any
theory
the
great
religions
have
recognized
that
heredity
could
not
explain
the
whole
question
of
self
not
account
for
the
fate
of
the
original
residual
self
so
they
have
generally
united
in
holding
the
inner
independent
of
the
outer
being
science
can
no
more
fully
decide
the
issues
they
have
raised
than
it
can
decide
the
nature
of
again
we
may
vainly
ask
what
becomes
of
the
forces
which
constituted
the
vitality
of
a
dead
plant
much
more
difficult
the
question
what
becomes
of
the
sensations
which
formed
the
psychical
life
of
a
dead
man
nobody
can
explain
the
simplest
sensation
we
know
only
that
during
life
certain
active
forces
within
the
body
of
the
plant
or
the
body
of
the
man
adjusted
themselves
continually
to
outer
forces
and
that
after
the
interior
forces
could
no
longer
respond
to
the
pressure
of
the
exterior
forces
then
the
body
in
which
the
former
were
stored
was
dissolved
into
the
elements
out
of
which
it
had
been
built
up
we
know
nothing
more
of
the
ultimate
nature
of
those
elements
than
we
know
of
the
ultimate
nature
of
the
tendencies
which
united
them
but
we
have
more
right
to
believe
the
ultimates
of
life
persist
after
the
dissolution
of
the
forms
they
created
than
to
believe
they
cease
the
theory
of
spontaneous
generation
misnamed
for
only
in
a
qualified
sense
can
the
term
spontaneous
be
applied
to
the
theory
of
the
beginnings
of
mundane
life
is
a
theory
which
the
evolutionist
must
accept
and
which
can
frighten
none
aware
of
the
evidence
of
chemistry
that
matter
itself
is
in
evolution
the
real
theory
not
the
theory
of
organized
life
beginning
in
bottled
infusions
but
of
the
life
primordial
arising
upon
a
planetary
surface
has
enormous
nay
infinite
spiritual
significance
it
requires
the
belief
that
all
potentialities
of
life
and
thought
and
emotion
pass
from
nebula
to
universe
from
system
to
system
from
star
to
planet
or
moon
and
again
back
to
cyclonic
storms
of
atomicity
it
means
that
tendencies
survive
sunburnings
survive
all
cosmic
evolutions
and
disintegrations
the
elements
are
evolutionary
products
only
and
the
difference
of
universe
from
universe
must
be
the
creation
of
tendencies
of
a
form
of
heredity
too
vast
and
complex
for
imagination
there
is
no
chance
there
is
only
law
each
fresh
evolution
must
be
influenced
by
previous
evolutions
just
as
each
individual
human
life
is
influenced
by
the
experience
of
all
the
lives
in
its
ancestral
chain
must
not
the
tendencies
even
of
the
ancestral
forms
of
matter
be
inherited
by
the
forms
of
matter
to
come
and
may
not
the
acts
and
thoughts
of
men
even
now
be
helping
to
shape
the
character
of
future
worlds
no
longer
is
it
possible
to
say
that
the
dreams
of
the
alchemists
were
absurdities
and
no
longer
can
we
even
assert
that
all
material
phenomena
are
not
determined
as
in
the
thought
of
the
ancient
east
by
whether
our
dead
do
or
do
not
continue
to
dwell
without
us
as
well
as
within
us
a
question
not
to
be
decided
in
our
present
undeveloped
state
of
comparative
blindness
certain
it
is
that
the
testimony
of
cosmic
facts
accords
with
one
weird
belief
of
shinto
the
belief
that
all
things
are
determined
by
the
dead
whether
by
ghosts
of
men
or
ghosts
of
worlds
even
as
our
personal
lives
are
ruled
by
the
now
viewless
lives
of
the
past
so
doubtless
the
life
of
our
earth
and
of
the
system
to
which
it
belongs
is
ruled
by
ghosts
of
spheres
innumerable
dead
universes
dead
suns
and
planets
and
moons
as
forms
long
since
dissolved
into
the
night
but
as
forces
immortal
and
eternally
working
back
to
the
sun
indeed
like
the
shintoist
we
can
trace
our
descent
yet
we
know
that
even
there
the
beginning
of
us
was
not
infinitely
more
remote
in
time
than
a
million
was
that
beginning
if
it
can
truly
be
said
there
was
a
beginning
the
teaching
of
evolution
is
that
we
are
one
with
that
unknown
ultimate
of
which
matter
and
human
mind
are
but
manifestations
the
teaching
of
evolution
is
also
that
each
of
us
is
many
yet
that
all
of
us
are
still
one
with
each
other
and
with
the
cosmos
that
we
must
know
all
past
humanity
not
only
in
ourselves
but
likewise
in
the
preciousness
and
beauty
of
every
that
we
can
best
love
ourselves
in
others
that
we
shall
best
serve
ourselves
in
others
that
forms
are
but
veils
and
phantoms
and
that
to
the
formless
infinite
alone
really
belong
all
human
emotions
whether
of
the
living
or
the
dead

poem
by
kimiko
i
the
name
is
on
a
at
the
entrance
of
a
house
in
the
street
of
the
geisha
seen
at
night
the
street
is
one
of
the
queerest
in
the
world
it
is
narrow
as
a
gangway
and
the
dark
shining
woodwork
of
the
all
tightly
closed
each
having
a
tiny
sliding
door
with
that
look
just
like
frosted
glass
makes
you
think
of
really
the
buildings
are
several
stories
high
but
you
do
not
observe
this
at
once
especially
if
there
be
no
moon
because
only
the
lower
stories
are
illuminated
up
to
their
awnings
above
which
all
is
darkness
the
illumination
is
made
by
lamps
behind
the
narrow
doors
and
by
the
hanging
outside
one
at
every
door
you
look
down
the
street
between
two
lines
of
these
lanterns
lines
converging
into
one
motionless
bar
of
yellow
light
some
of
the
lanterns
are
some
cylindrical
others
or
and
japanese
characters
are
beautifully
written
upon
them
the
street
is
very
quiet
silent
as
a
display
of
in
some
great
exhibition
after
this
is
because
the
inmates
are
mostly
away
at
tending
banquets
and
other
festivities
their
life
is
of
the
night
the
legend
upon
the
first
lantern
to
the
left
as
you
go
south
is
kinoya
uchi
and
that
means
the
house
of
gold
wherein
dwells
the
lantern
to
the
right
tells
of
the
house
of
nishimura
and
of
a
girl
miyotsuru
which
name
signifies
the
stork
magnificently
existing
next
upon
the
left
comes
the
house
of
kajita
and
in
that
house
are
kohana
the
and
hinako
whose
face
is
pretty
as
the
face
of
a
doll
opposite
is
the
house
nagaye
wherein
live
kimika
and
kimiko
and
this
luminous
double
litany
of
names
is
long
the
inscription
on
the
lantern
of
the
house
reveals
the
relationship
between
kimika
and
kimiko
and
yet
something
more
for
kimiko
is
styled
an
honorary
untranslatable
title
which
signifies
that
she
is
only
kimiko
kimika
is
the
teacher
and
mistress
she
has
educated
two
geisha
both
named
or
rather
renamed
by
her
kimiko
and
this
use
of
the
same
name
twice
is
proof
positive
that
the
first
kimiko
must
have
been
celebrated
the
professional
appellation
borne
by
an
unlucky
or
unsuccessful
geisha
is
never
given
to
her
successor
if
you
should
ever
have
good
and
sufficient
reason
to
enter
the
house
pushing
open
that
of
a
door
which
sets
a
ringing
to
announce
visits
you
might
be
able
to
see
kimika
provided
her
little
troupe
be
not
engaged
for
the
evening
you
would
find
her
a
very
intelligent
person
and
well
worth
talking
to
she
can
tell
when
she
pleases
the
most
remarkable
stories
real
stories
true
stories
of
human
nature
for
the
street
of
the
geisha
is
full
of
traditions
tragic
comic
melodramatic
every
house
has
its
memories
and
kimika
knows
them
all
some
are
very
very
terrible
and
some
would
make
you
laugh
and
some
would
make
you
think
the
story
of
the
first
kimiko
belongs
to
the
last
class
it
is
not
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
but
it
is
one
of
the
least
difficult
for
western
people
to
understand
ii
there
is
no
more
kimiko
she
is
only
a
remembrance
kimika
was
quite
young
when
she
called
that
kimiko
her
professional
sister
an
exceedingly
wonderful
girl
is
what
kimika
says
of
kimiko
to
win
any
renown
in
her
profession
a
geisha
must
be
pretty
or
very
clever
and
the
famous
ones
are
usually
both
having
been
selected
at
a
very
early
age
by
their
trainers
according
to
the
promise
of
such
qualities
even
the
commoner
class
of
must
have
some
charm
in
their
best
years
if
only
that
du
which
inspired
the
japanese
proverb
that
even
a
devil
is
pretty
at
eighteen
but
kimiko
was
much
more
than
pretty
she
was
according
to
the
japanese
ideal
of
beauty
and
that
standard
is
not
reached
by
one
woman
in
a
hundred
thousand
also
she
was
more
than
clever
she
was
accomplished
she
composed
very
dainty
poems
could
arrange
flowers
exquisitely
perform
faultlessly
embroider
make
silk
mosaic
in
short
she
was
genteel
and
her
first
public
appearance
made
a
flutter
in
the
fast
world
of
kyoto
it
was
evident
that
she
could
make
almost
any
conquest
she
pleased
and
that
fortune
was
before
her
but
it
soon
became
evident
also
that
she
had
been
perfectly
trained
for
her
profession
she
had
been
taught
how
to
conduct
herself
under
almost
any
possible
circumstances
for
what
she
could
not
have
known
kimika
knew
everything
about
the
power
of
beauty
and
the
weakness
of
passion
the
craft
of
promises
and
the
worth
of
indifference
and
all
the
folly
and
evil
in
the
hearts
of
men
so
kimiko
made
few
mistakes
and
shed
few
tears
by
and
by
she
proved
to
be
as
kimika
wished
slightly
dangerous
so
a
lamp
is
to
otherwise
some
of
them
would
put
it
out
the
duty
of
the
lamp
is
to
make
pleasant
things
visible
it
has
no
malice
kimiko
had
no
malice
and
was
not
too
dangerous
anxious
parents
discovered
that
she
did
not
want
to
enter
into
respectable
families
nor
even
to
lend
herself
to
any
serious
romances
but
she
was
not
particularly
merciful
to
that
class
of
youths
who
sign
documents
with
their
own
blood
and
ask
a
to
cut
off
the
extreme
end
of
the
little
finger
of
her
left
hand
as
a
pledge
of
eternal
affection
she
was
mischievous
enough
with
them
to
cure
them
of
their
folly
some
rich
folks
who
offered
her
lands
and
houses
on
condition
of
owning
her
body
and
soul
found
her
less
merciful
one
proved
generous
enough
to
purchase
her
freedom
unconditionally
at
a
price
which
made
kimika
a
rich
woman
and
kimiko
was
grateful
but
she
remained
a
geisha
she
managed
her
rebuffs
with
too
much
tact
to
excite
hate
and
knew
how
to
heal
despairs
in
most
cases
there
were
exceptions
of
course
one
old
man
who
thought
life
not
worth
living
unless
he
could
get
kimiko
all
to
himself
invited
her
to
a
banquet
one
evening
and
asked
her
to
drink
wine
with
him
but
kimika
accustomed
to
read
faces
deftly
substituted
tea
which
has
precisely
the
same
color
for
wine
and
so
instinctively
saved
the
girl
precious
life
for
only
ten
minutes
later
the
soul
of
the
silly
host
was
on
its
way
to
the
meido
alone
and
doubtless
greatly
disappointed
after
that
night
kimika
watched
over
kimiko
as
a
wild
cat
guards
her
kitten
the
kitten
became
a
fashionable
mania
a
craze
delirium
one
of
the
great
sights
and
sensations
of
the
period
there
is
a
foreign
prince
who
remembers
her
name
he
sent
her
a
gift
of
diamonds
which
she
never
wore
other
presents
in
multitude
she
received
from
all
who
could
afford
the
luxury
of
pleasing
her
and
to
be
in
her
good
graces
even
for
a
day
was
the
ambition
of
the
gilded
youth
nevertheless
she
allowed
no
one
to
imagine
himself
a
special
favorite
and
refused
to
make
any
contracts
for
perpetual
affection
to
any
protests
on
the
subject
she
answered
that
she
knew
her
place
even
respectable
women
spoke
not
unkindly
of
her
because
her
name
never
figured
in
any
story
of
family
unhappiness
she
really
kept
her
place
time
seemed
to
make
her
more
charming
other
geisha
grew
into
fame
but
no
one
was
even
classed
with
her
some
manufacturers
secured
the
sole
right
to
use
her
photograph
for
a
label
and
that
label
made
a
fortune
for
the
firm
but
one
day
the
startling
news
was
abroad
that
kimiko
had
at
last
shown
a
very
soft
heart
she
had
actually
said
to
kimika
and
had
gone
away
with
somebody
able
to
give
her
all
the
pretty
dresses
she
could
wish
for
somebody
eager
to
give
her
social
position
also
and
to
silence
gossip
about
her
naughty
past
somebody
willing
to
die
for
her
ten
times
over
and
already
for
love
of
her
kimika
said
that
a
fool
had
tried
to
kill
himself
because
of
kimiko
and
that
kimiko
had
taken
pity
on
him
and
nursed
him
back
to
foolishness
taiko
hideyoshi
had
said
that
there
were
only
two
things
in
this
world
which
he
feared
a
fool
and
a
dark
night
kimika
had
always
been
afraid
of
a
fool
and
a
fool
had
taken
kimiko
away
and
she
added
with
not
unselfish
tears
that
kimiko
would
never
come
back
to
her
it
was
a
case
of
love
on
both
sides
for
the
time
of
several
existences
nevertheless
kimika
was
only
half
right
she
was
very
shrewd
indeed
but
she
had
never
been
able
to
see
into
certain
private
chambers
in
the
soul
of
kimiko
if
she
could
have
seen
she
would
have
screamed
for
astonishment
oni
mo
jiuhachi
azami
no
hana
there
is
a
similar
saying
of
a
dragon
ja
mo
hatachi
even
a
dragon
at
twenty
iii
between
kimiko
and
other
geisha
there
was
a
difference
of
gentle
blood
before
she
took
a
professional
name
her
name
was
ai
which
written
with
the
proper
character
means
love
written
with
another
character
the
same
signifies
grief
the
story
of
ai
was
a
story
of
both
grief
and
love
she
had
been
nicely
brought
up
as
a
child
she
had
been
sent
to
a
private
school
kept
by
an
old
samurai
where
the
little
girls

the

days

better
salaries
than

not

so
honest

so
pleasant

it

be

just
been

japanese

of
english
german
and

about

excellently
chosen
and
illustrated
with
tiny
innocent
pictures
of
western
people

costumes

those
dear

now
curiosities
they
have
long
been
superseded
by
pretentious
compilations
much
less
lovingly
and
sensibly
edited

learned
well
once
a
year
at
examination
time
a
great
official
would
visit
the
school
and
talk
to
the
children
as
if
they
were
all
his
own
and
stroke
each
silky
head
as
he
distributed
the
prizes
he
is
now
a
retired
statesman
and
has
doubtless
forgotten
ai
and
in
the
schools
of
nobody
caresses
little
girls
or
gives
them
prizes
then
came
those
reconstructive
changes
by
which
families
of
rank
were
reduced
to
obscurity
and
poverty
and
ai
had
to
leave
school
many
great
sorrows
followed
till
there
remained
to
her
only
her
mother
and
an
infant
sister
the
mother
and
ai
could
do
little
but
weave
and
by
weaving
alone
they
could
not

enough

whose

is
called

the
people
no
the
money
of
tears
help
from
the
living
was
scanty
for
most
of
the
of
kin
were
in
like
distress
but
when
there
was
nothing
left
to
sell
not
even
little
help
was
sought
from
the
dead
for
it
was
remembered
that
the
father
of
al
father
had
been
buried
with
his
sword
the
gift
of
a
daimyo
and
that
the
mountings
of
the
weapon
were
of
gold
so
the
grave
was
opened
and
the
grand
hilt
of
curious
workmanship
exchanged
for
a
common
one
and
the
ornaments
of
the
lacquered
sheath
removed
but
the
good
blade
was
not
taken
because
the
warrior
might
need
it
ai
saw
his
face
as
he
sat
erect
in
the
great
urn
which
served
in
lieu
of
coffin
to
the
samurai
of
high
rank
when
buried
by
the
ancient
rite
his
features
were
still
recognizable
after
all
those
years
of
sepulture
and
he
seemed
to
nod
a
grim
assent
to
what
had
been
done
as
his
sword
was
given
back
to
him
at
last
the
mother
of
ai
became
too
weak
and
ill
to
work
at
the
loom
and
the
gold
of
the
dead
had
been
spent
ai
said
mother
i
know
there
is
but
one
thing
now
to
do
let
me
be
sold
to
the
the
mother
wept
and
made
no
reply
ai
did
not
weep
but
went
out
alone
she
remembered
that
in
other
days
when
banquets
were
given
in
her
father
house
and
dancers
served
the
wine
a
free
geisha
named
kimika
had
often
caressed
her
she
went
straight
to
the
house
of
kimika
i
want
you
to
buy
me
said
ai
and
i
want
a
great
deal
of
money
kimika
laughed
and
petted
her
and
made
her
eat
and
heard
her
story
which
was
bravely
told
without
one
tear
my
child
said
kimika
i
can
not
give
you
a
great
deal
of
money
for
i
have
very
little
but
this
i
can
do
i
can
promise
to
support
your
mother
that
will
be
better
than
to
give
her
much
money
for
you
because
your
mother
my
child
has
been
a
great
lady
and
therefore
can
not
know
how
to
use
money
cunningly
ask
your
honored
mother
to
sign
the
bond
promising
that
you
will
stay
with
me
till
you
are
years
old
or
until
such
time
as
you
can
pay
me
back
and
what
money
i
can
now
spare
take
home
with
you
as
a
free
gift
thus
ai
became
a
geisha
and
kimika
renamed
her
kimiko
and
kept
the
pledge
to
maintain
the
mother
and
the
the
mother
died
before
kimiko
became
famous
the
little
sister
was
put
to
school
afterwards
those
things
already
told
came
to
pass
the
young
man
who
had
wanted
to
die
for
love
of
a
was
worthy
of
better
things
he
was
an
only
son
and
his
parents
wealthy
and
titled
people
were
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
him
even
that
of
accepting
a
geisha
for
moreover
they
were
not
altogether
displeased
with
kimiko
because
of
her
sympathy
for
their
boy
before
going
away
kimiko
attended
the
wedding
of
her
young
sister
ume
who
had
just
finished
school
she
was
good
and
pretty
kimiko
had
made
the
match
and
used
her
wicked
knowledge
of
men
in
making
it
she
chose
a
very
plain
honest
merchant
a
man
who
could
not
have
been
bad
even
if
he
tried
ume
did
not
question
the
wisdom
of
her
choice
which
time
proved
fortunate
iv
it
was
in
the
period
of
the
fourth
moon
that
kimiko
was
carried
away
to
the
home
prepared
for
her
a
place
in
which
to
forget
all
the
unpleasant
realities
of
life
sort
of
lost
in
the
charmed
repose
of
great
shadowy
silent
gardens
therein
she
might
have
felt
as
one
reborn
by
reason
of
good
deeds
into
the
realm
of
horai
but
the
spring
passed
and
the
summer
came
and
kimiko
remained
simply
kimiko
three
times
she
had
contrived
for
reasons
unspoken
to
put
off
the
in
the
period
of
the
eighth
moon
kimiko
ceased
to
be
playful
and
told
her
reasons
very
gently
but
very
firmly
it
is
time
that
i
should
say
what
i
have
long
delayed
saying
for
the
sake
of
the
mother
who
gave
me
life
and
for
the
sake
of
my
little
sister
i
have
lived
in
hell
all
that
is
past
but
the
scorch
of
the
fire
is
upon
me
and
there
is
no
power
that
can
take
it
away
it
is
not
for
such
as
i
to
enter
into
an
honored
family
nor
to
bear
you
a
son
nor
to
build
up
your
house
suffer
me
to
speak
for
in
the
knowing
of
wrong
i
am
very
very
much
wiser
than
you
never
shall
i
be
your
wife
to
become
your
shame
i
am
your
companion
only
your
your
guest
of
an
hour
and
this
not
for
any
gifts
when
i
shall
be
no
longer
with
you
nay
certainly
that
day
must
come
you
will
have
clearer
sight
i
shall
still
be
dear
to
you
but
not
in
the
same
way
as
now
which
is
foolishness
you
will
remember
these
words
out
of
my
heart
some
true
sweet
lady
will
be
chosen
for
you
to
become
the
mother
of
your
children
i
shall
see
them
but
the
place
of
a
wife
i
shall
never
take
and
the
joy
of
a
mother
i
must
never
know
i
am
only
your
folly
my
beloved
an
illusion
a
dream
a
shadow
flitting
across
your
life
somewhat
more
in
later
time
i
may
become
but
a
wife
to
you
never
neither
in
this
existence
nor
in
the
next
ask
me
i
go
in
the
period
of
the
tenth
moon
and
without
any
reason
imaginable
kimiko
disappeared
vanished
utterly
ceased
to
exist
v
nobody
knew
when
or
how
or
whither
she
had
gone
even
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
home
she
had
left
none
had
seen
her
pass
at
first
it
seemed
that
she
must
soon
return
of
all
her
beautiful
and
precious
robes
her
ornaments
her
presents
a
fortune
in
themselves
she
had
taken
nothing
but
weeks
passed
without
word
or
sign
and
it
was
feared
that
something
terrible
had
befallen
her
rivers
were
dragged
and
wells
were
searched
inquiries
were
made
by
telegraph
and
by
letter
trusted
servants
were
sent
to
look
for
her
rewards
were
offered
for
any
news
especially
a
reward
to
kimika
who
was
really
attached
to
the
girl
and
would
have
been
only
too
happy
to
find
her
without
any
reward
at
all
but
the
mystery
remained
a
mystery
application
to
the
authorities
would
have
been
useless
the
fugitive
had
done
no
wrong
broken
no
law
and
the
vast
machinery
of
the
imperial
was
not
to
be
set
in
motion
by
the
passionate
whim
of
a
boy
months
grew
into
years
but
neither
kimika
nor
the
little
sister
in
kyoto
nor
any
one
of
the
thousands
who
had
known
and
admired
the
beautiful
dancer
ever
saw
kimiko
again
but
what
she
had
foretold
came
true
for
time
dries
all
tears
and
quiets
all
longing
and
even
in
japan
one
does
not
really
try
to
die
twice
for
the
same
despair
the
lover
of
kimiko
became
wiser
and
there
was
found
for
him
a
very
sweet
person
for
wife
who
gave
him
a
son
and
other
years
passed
and
there
was
happiness
in
the
where
kimiko
had
once
been
there
came
to
that
home
one
morning
as
if
seeking
alms
a
traveling
nun
and
the
child
hearing
her
buddhist
cry
of
i
ha
i
ran
to
the
gate
and
presently
a
bringing
out
the
customary
gift
of
rice
wondered
to
see
the
nun
caressing
the
child
and
whispering
to
him
then
the
little
one
cried
to
the
servant
let
me
give
and
the
nun
pleaded
from
under
the
veiling
shadow
of
her
great
straw
hat
honorably
allow
the
child
to
give
me
so
the
boy
put
the
rice
into
the
mendicant
bowl
then
she
thanked
him
and
asked
now
will
you
say
again
for
me
the
little
word
which
i
prayed
you
to
tell
your
honored
father
and
the
child
lisped
one
whom
you
will
never
see
again
in
this
world
says
that
her
heart
is
glad
because
she
has
seen
your
the
nun
laughed
softly
and
caressed
him
again
and
passed
away
swiftly
and
the
servant
wondered
more
than
ever
while
the
child
ran
to
tell
his
father
the
words
of
the
mendicant
but
the
father
eyes
dimmed
as
he
heard
the
words
and
he
wept
over
his
boy
for
he
and
only
he
knew
who
had
been
at
the
gate
and
the
sacrificial
meaning
of
all
that
had
been
hidden
now
he
thinks
much
but
tells
his
thought
to
no
one
he
knows
that
the
space
between
sun
and
sun
is
less
than
the
space
between
himself
and
the
woman
who
loved
him
he
knows
it
were
vain
to
ask
in
what
remote
city
in
what
fantastic
riddle
of
narrow
nameless
streets
in
what
obscure
little
temple
known
only
to
the
poorest
poor
she
waits
for
the
darkness
before
the
dawn
of
the
immeasurable
light
when
the
face
of
the
teacher
will
smile
upon
her
when
the
voice
of
the
teacher
will
say
to
her
in
tones
of
sweetness
deeper
than
ever
came
from

lover
lips
my
daughter

appendix
three
popular
ballads
read
before
the
asiatic
society
of
japan
october
during
the
spring
of
i
visited
the
settlement
in
matsue
izumo
of
an
outcast
people
known
as
the
some
results
of
the
visit
were
subsequently
communicated
to
the
japan
mail
in
a
letter
published
june
and
some
extracts
from
that
letter
i
think
it
may
be
worth
while
to
cite
here
by
way
of
introduction
to
the
subject
of
the
present
paper
the
settlement
is
at
the
southern
end
of
matsue
in
a
tiny
valley
or
rather
hollow
among
the
hills
which
form
a
behind
the
city
few
japanese
of
the
better
classes
have
ever
visited
such
a
village
and
even
the
poorest
of
the
common
people
shun
the
place
as
they
would
shun
a
centre
of
contagion
for
the
idea
of
defilement
both
moral
and
physical
is
still
attached
to
the
very
name
of
its
inhabitants
thus
although
the
settlement
is
within
half
an
hour
walk
from
the
heart
of
the
city
probably
not
half
a
dozen
of
the
thousand
residents
of
matsue
have
visited
it
there
are
four
distinct
outcast
classes
in
matsue
and
its
environs
the
the
the
and
the
of
suguta
there
are
two
settlements
of
these
were
formerly
the
public
executioners
and
served
under
the
police
in
various
capacities
although
by
ancient
law
the
lowest
class
of
pariahs
their
intelligence
was
sufficiently
cultivated
by
police
service
and
by
contact
with
superiors
to
elevate
them
in
popular
opinion
above
the
other
outcasts
they
are
now
manufacturers
of
bamboo
cages
and
baskets
they
are
said
to
be
descendants
of
the
family
and
retainers
of
the
only
man
in
japan
who
ever
seriously
conspired
to
seize
the
imperial
throes
by
armed
force
and
who
was
killed
by
the
famous
general
the
are
slaughterers
and
dealers
in
hides
they
are
never
allowed
to
enter
any
house
in
matsue
except
the
shop
of
a
dealer
in
geta
and
other
footgear
originally
vagrants
they
were
permanently
settled
in
matsue
by
some
famous
daimyo
who
built
for
them
small
houses
on
the
bank
of
the
canal
hence
their
name
as
for
the
proper
their
condition
and
calling
are
too
familiar
to
need
comment
in
this
connection
the
are
so
called
because
they
live
among
the
hills
at
the
southern
end
of
matsue
they
have
a
monopoly
of
the
business
and
are
buyers
of
all
sorts
of
refuse
from
old
bottles
to
machinery
some
of
them
are
rich
indeed
the
whole
class
is
compared
with
other
outcast
classes
prosperous
nevertheless
public
prejudice
against
them
is
still
almost
as
strong
as
in
the
years
previous
to
the
abrogation
of
the
special
laws
concerning
them
under
no
conceivable
circumstances
could
any
of
them
obtain
employment
as
servants
their
prettiest
girls
in
old
times
often
became
but
at
no
time
could
they
enter
a
in
any
neighboring
city
much
less
in
their
own
so
they
were
sold
to
establishments
in
remote
places
a
could
not
even
become
a
he
could
not
obtain
employment
as
a
common
laborer
in
any
capacity
except
by
going
to
some
distant
city
where
he
could
hope
to
conceal
his
origin
but
if
detected
under
such
conditions
he
would
run
serious
risk
of
being
killed
by
his
under
any
circumstance
it
would
be
difficult
for
a
to
pass
himself
off
for
a
centuries
of
isolation
and
prejudice
have
fixed
and
moulded
the
manners
of
the
class
in
recognizable
ways
and
even
its
language
has
become
a
special
and
curious
dialect
i
was
anxious
to
see
something
of
a
class
so
singularly
situated
and
specialized
and
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
a
japanese
gentleman
who
although
belonging
to
the
highest
class
of
matsue
was
kind
enough
to
agree
to
accompany
me
to
their
village
where
he
had
never
been
himself
on
the
way
thither
he
told
me
many
curious
things
about
the
in
feudal
times
these
people
had
been
kindly
treated
by
the
samurai
and
they
were
often
allowed
or
invited
to
enter
the
courts
of
samurai
dwellings
to
sing
and
dance
for
which
performances
they
were
paid
the
songs
and
the
dances
with
which
they
were
able
to
entertain
even
those
aristocratic
families
were
known
to
no
other
people
and
were
called
singing
the
was
in
fact
the
special
hereditary
art
of
the
and
represented
their
highest
comprehension
of
aesthetic
and
emotional
matters
in
former
times
they
could
not
obtain
admittance
to
a
respectable
theatre
and
like
the
had
theatres
of
their
own
it
would
be
interesting
my
friend
added
to
learn
the
origin
of
their
songs
and
their
dances
for
their
songs
are
not
in
their
own
special
dialect
but
in
pure
japanese
and
that
they
should
have
been
able
to
preserve
this
oral
literature
without
deterioration
is
especially
remarkable
from
the
fact
that
the
were
never
taught
to
read
or
write
they
could
not
even
avail
themselves
of
those
new
educational
opportunities
which
the
era
of
meiji
has
given
to
the
masses
prejudice
is
still
far
too
strong
to
allow
of
their
children
being
happy
in
a
public
school
a
small
special
school
might
be
possible
though
there
would
perhaps
be
no
small
difficulty
in
obtaining
willing
teachers
the
hollow
in
which
the
village
stands
is
immediately
behind
the
buddhist
cemetery
of
tokoji
the
settlement
has
its
own
shinto
temple
i
was
extremely
surprised
at
the
aspect
of
the
place
for
i
had
expected
to
see
a
good
deal
of
ugliness
and
filth
on
the
contrary
i
saw
a
multitude
of
neat
dwellings
with
pretty
gardens
about
them
and
pictures
on
the
walls
of
the
rooms
there
were
many
trees
the
village
was
green
with
shrubs
and
plants
and
picturesque
to
an
extreme
degree
for
owing
to
the
irregularity
of
the
ground
the
tiny
streets
climbed
up
and
down
hill
at
all
sorts
of
angles
the
loftiest
street
being
fifty
or
sixty
feet
above
the
lowermost
a
large
public
and
a
public
laundry
bore
evidence
that
the
liked
clean
linen
as
well
as
their
neighbors
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
a
crowd
soon
gathered
to
look
at
the
strangers
who
had
come
to
their
village
a
rare
event
for
them
the
faces
i
saw
seemed
much
like
the
faces
of
the
except
that
i
fancied
the
ugly
ones
were
uglier
making
the
pretty
ones
appear
more
pretty
by
contrast
there
were
one
or
two
sinister
faces
recalling
faces
of
gypsies
that
i
had
seen
while
some
little
girls
on
the
other
hand
had
remarkably
pleasing
features
there
were
no
exchanges
of
civilities
as
upon
meeting
a
japanese
of
the
better
class
would
as
soon
think
of
taking
off
his
hat
to
a
as
a
planter
would
think
of
bowing
to
a
negro
the
themselves
usually
show
by
their
attitude
that
they
expect
no
forms
none
of
the
men
saluted
us
but
some
of
the
women
on
being
kindly
addressed
made
obeisance
other
women
weaving
coarse
straw
sandals
an
inferior
quality
of
zori
would
answer
only
or
to
questions
and
seemed
to
be
suspicious
of
us
my
friend
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
women
were
dressed
differently
from
japanese
women
of
the
ordinary
classes
for
example
even
among
the
very
poorest
there
are
certain
accepted
laws
of
costume
there
are
certain
colors
which
may
or
may
not
be
worn
according
to
age
but
even
elderly
women
among
these
people
wear
obi
of
bright
red
or
variegated
hues
and
kimono
of
a
showy
tint
those
of
the
women
seen
in
the
city
street
selling
or
buying
are
the
elders
only
the
younger
stay
at
home
the
elderly
women
always
go
into
town
with
large
baskets
of
a
peculiar
shape
by
which
the
fact
that
they
are
is
at
once
known
numbers
of
these
baskets
were
visible
principally
at
the
doors
of
the
smaller
dwellings
they
are
carried
on
the
back
and
are
used
to
contain
all
that
the
old
paper
old
wearing
apparel
bottles
broken
glass
and
a
woman
at
last
ventured
to
invite
us
to
her
house
to
look
at
some
old
colored
prints
she
wished
to
sell
thither
we
went
and
were
as
nicely
received
as
in
a
residence
the
pictures
including
a
number
of
drawings
by
hiroshige
proved
to
be
worth
buying
and
my
friend
then
asked
if
we
could
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
to
my
great
satisfaction
the
proposal
was
well
received
and
on
our
agreeing
to
pay
a
trifle
to
each
singer
a
small
band
of
young
girls
whom
we
had
not
seen
before
made
their
appearance
and
prepared
to
sing
while
an
old
woman
made
ready
to
dance
both
the
old
woman
and
the
girls
provided
themselves
with
curious
instruments
for
the
performance
three
girls
had
instruments
shaped
like
mallets
made
of
paper
and
bamboo
these
were
intended
to
represent
the
hammer
of
they
were
held
in
the
left
hand
a
fan
being
waved
in
the
right
other
girls
were
provided
with
a
kind
of
castanets
two
flat
pieces
of
hard
dark
wood
connected
by
a
string
six
girls
formed
in
a
line
before
the
house
the
old
woman
took
her
place
facing
the
girls
holding
in
her
hands
two
little
sticks
one
stick
being
notched
along
a
part
of
its
length
by
drawing
it
across
the
other
stick
a
curious
rattling
noise
was
made
my
friend
pointed
out
to
me
that
the
singers
formed
two
distinct
parties
of
three
each
those
bearing
the
hammer
and
fan
were
the
daikoku
band
they
were
to
sing
the
ballads
those
with
the
castanets
were
the
ebisu
party
and
formed
the
chorus
the
old
woman
rubbed
her
little
sticks
together
and
from
the
throats
of
the
daikoku
band
there
rang
out
a
clear
sweet
burst
of
song
quite
different
from
anything
i
had
heard
before
in
japan
while
the
tapping
of
the
castanets
kept
exact
time
to
the
syllabification
of
the
words
which
were
very
rapidly
uttered
when
the
first
three
girls
had
sung
a
certain
number
of
lines
the
voices
of
the
other
three
joined
in
producing
a
very
pleasant
though
untrained
harmony
and
all
sang
the
burden
together
then
the
daikoku
party
began
another
verse
and
after
a
certain
interval
the
chorus
was
again
sung
in
the
meanwhile
the
old
woman
was
dancing
a
very
fantastic
dance
which
provoked
laughter
from
the
crowd
occasionally
chanting
a
few
comic
words
the
song
was
not
comic
however
it
was
a
very
pathetic
ballad
entitled
yaoya
was
a
beautiful
girl
who
set
fire
to
her
own
house
in
order
to
obtain
another
meeting
with
her
lover
an
acolyte
in
a
temple
where
she
expected
that
her
family
would
be
obliged
to
take
refuge
after
the
fire
but
being
detected
and
convicted
of
arson
she
was
condemned
by
the
severe
law
of
that
age
to
be
burnt
alive
the
sentence
was
carried
into
effect
but
the
youth
and
beauty
of
the
victim
and
the
motive
of
her
offense
evoked
a
sympathy
in
the
popular
heart
which
found
later
expression
in
song
and
drama
none
of
the
performers
except
the
old
woman
lifted
the
feet
from
the
ground
while
singing
but
all
swayed
their
bodies
in
time
to
the
melody
the
singing
lasted
more
than
one
hour
during
which
the
voices
never
failed
in
their
quality
and
yet
so
far
from
being
weary
of
it
and
although
i
could
not
understand
a
word
uttered
i
felt
very
sorry
when
it
was
all
over
and
with
the
pleasure
received
there
came
to
the
foreign
listener
also
a
strong
sense
of
sympathy
for
the
young
singers
victims
of
a
prejudice
so
ancient
that
its
origin
is
no
longer
known
since
the
time
this
letter
to
the
mail
was
written
a
primary
school
has
been
established
for
the

the
benevolence
of

undertaking

not
escape
severe
local
criticism

to
have
proved
successful

the
foregoing
extracts
from
my
letter
to

mail
tell
the
history
of
my
interest
in
the
at
a
later
time
i
was
able
to
procure
through
the
kindness
of
my
friend
nishida
sentaro
of
matsue
written
copies
of
three
of
the
ballads
as
sung
by
the
and
translations
of
these
were
afterwards
made
for
me
i
now
venture
to
offer
my
prose
renderings
of
the
ballads
based
on
the
translations
referred
to
as
examples
of
not
devoid
of
interest
an
absolutely
literal
rendering
executed
with
the
utmost
care
and
amply
supplied
with
explanatory
notes
would
be
of
course
more
worthy
the
attention
of
a
learned
society
such
a
version
would
however
require
a
knowledge
of
japanese
which
i
do
not
possess
as
well
as
much
time
and
patient
labor
were
the
texts
in
of
value
sufficient
to
justify
a
scholarly
translation
i
should
not
have
attempted
any
translation
at
all
but
i
felt
convinced
that
their
interest
was
of
a
sort
which
could
not
be
much
diminished
by
a
free
and
easy
treatment
from
any
purely
literary
point
of
view
the
texts
are
disappointing
exhibiting
no
great
power
of
imagination
and
nothing
really
worthy
to
be
called
poetical
art
while
reading
such
verses
we
find
ourselves
very
far
away
indeed
from
the
veritable
poetry
of
japan
from
those
compositions
which
with
a
few
chosen
syllables
only
can
either
create
a
perfect
colored
picture
in
the
mind
or
bestir
the
finest
sensations
of
memory
with
marvelous
penetrative
delicacy
the
are
extremely
crude
and
their
long
popularity
has
been
due
i
fancy
rather
to
the
very
interesting
manner
of
singing
them
than
to
any
quality
which
could
permit
us
to
compare
them
with
the
old
english
ballads
the
legends
upon
which
these
chants
were
based
still
exist
in
many
other
forms
including
dramatic
compositions
i
need
scarcely
refer
to
the
vast
number
of
artistic
suggestions
which
they
have
given
but
i
may
observe
that
their
influence
in
this
regard
has
not
yet
passed
away
only
a
few
months
ago
i
saw
a
number
of
pretty
cotton
prints
fresh
from
the
mill
picturing
making
the
horse
onikage
stand
upon
a
chessboard
whether
the
versions
of
the
ballads
i
obtained
in
izumo
were
composed
there
or
elsewhere
i
am
quite
unable
to
say
but
the
stories
of
and
yaoya
are
certainly
well
known
in
every
part
of
japan
together
with
these
prose
translations
i
submit
to
the
society
the
original
texts
to
which
are
appended
some
notes
of
interest
about
the
local
customs
connected
with
the
singing
of
the
about
the
symbols
used
by
the
dancers
and
about
the
comic
phrases
chanted
at
intervals
during
the
performances
phrases
of
which
the
coarse
humor
sometimes
forbids
any
rendering
all
the
ballads
are
written
in
the
same
measure
exemplified
by
the
first
four
lines
of
yaoya

the
chorus
or
does
not
seem
to
be
sung
at
the
end
of
a
fixed
number
of
lines
but
rather
at
the
termination
of
certain
parts
of
the
recitative
there
is
also
no
fixed
limit
to
the
number
of
singers
in
either
band
these
may
be
very
many
or
very
few
i
think
that
the
curious
izumo
way
of
singing
the
burden
so
that
the
vowel
sounds
in
the
word
iya
uttered
by
one
band
and
in
the
word
sorei
uttered
by
the
other
are
made
to
blend
together
might
be
worth
the
attention
of
some
one
interested
in
japanese
indeed
i
am
convinced
that
a
very
delightful
and
wholly
unexplored
field
of
study
offers
itself
in
japan
to
the
student
of
and
popular
chants
the
songs
of
the
or
harvest
dances
with
their
curious
choruses
the
chants
of
the
which
differ
in
every
district
the
strange
snatches
of
song
often
sweet
and
weird
that
one
hears
from
the
or
the
mountain
slopes
in
remote
provinces
have
qualities
totally
different
from
those
we
are
accustomed
to
associate
with
the
idea
of
japanese
music
a
charm
indisputable
even
for
western
ears
because
not
less
in
harmony
with
the
nature
inspiring
it
than
the
song
of
a
bird
or
the
shrilling
of
cicadae
to
reproduce
such
melodies
with
their
extraordinary
fractional
tones
would
be
no
easy
task
but
i
can
not
help
believing
that
the
result
would
fully
repay
the
labor
not
only
do
they
represent
a
very
ancient
perhaps
primitive
musical
sense
they
represent
also
something
essentially
characteristic
of
the
race
and
there
is
surely
much
to
be
learned
in
regard
to
from
the
comparative
study
of
the
fact
however
that
few
of
those
peculiarities
which
give
so
strange
a
charm
to
the
old
are
noticeable
in
the
izumo
manner
of
singing
the
would
perhaps
indicate
that
the
latter
are
comparatively
modern
the
ballad
of
joyfully
young
daikoko
and
ebisu
enter
shall
we
tell
a
tale
or
shall
we
utter
felicitations
a
tale
then
of
what
is
it
best
that
we
should
tell
since
we
are
bidden
to
your
august
house
to
relate
a
story
we
shall
relate
the
story
of
shuntoku
surely
there
once
lived
in
the
province
of
kawachi
a
very
rich
man
called
nobuyoshi
and
his
eldest
son
was
called
when
that
eldest
son
was
only
three
years
old
his
mother
died
and
when
he
was
five
years
old
there
was
given
to
him
a
stepmother
when
he
was
seven
years
old
his
stepmother
gave
birth
to
a
son
who
was
called
and
the
two
brothers
grew
up
together
when
shuntoku
became
sixteen
years
old
he
went
to
kyoto
to
the
temple
of
to
make
offerings
to
the
god
there
he
saw
a
thousand
people
going
to
the
temple
and
a
thousand
returning
and
a
thousand
remaining
there
was
a
gathering
of
three
thousand
persons
through
that
multitude
the
youngest
daughter
of
a
rich
man
called
hagiyama
was
being
carried
to
the
temple
in
a
kago
shuntoku
also
was
traveling
in
a
kago
and
the
two
kago
moved
side
by
side
along
the
way
gazing
on
the
girl
shuntoku
fell
in
love
with
her
and
the
two
exchanged
looks
and
letters
of
love
all
this
was
told
to
the
stepmother
of
shuntoku
by
a
servant
that
was
a
flatterer
then
the
stepmother
began
to
think
that
should
the
youth
remain
in
his
father
home
the
east
and
west
and
the
granaries
north
and
south
and
the
house
that
stood
in
the
midst
could
never
belong
to
therefore
she
devised
an
evil
thing
and
spoke
to
her
husband
saying
sir
my
lord
may
i
have
your
honored
permission
to
be
free
for
seven
days
from
the
duties
of
the
household
her
husband
answered
yes
surely
but
what
is
it
that
you
wish
to
do
for
seven
days
she
said
to
him
before
being
wedded
to
my
lord
i
made
a
vow
to
the
august
deity
of
kiyomidzu
and
now
i
desire
to
go
to
the
temple
to
fulfill
that
vow
said
the
master
that
is
well
but
which
of
the
man
servants
or
maid
servants
would
you
wish
to
go
with
you
then
she
made
reply
neither
man
servant
nor
maid
servant
do
i
require
i
wish
to
go
all
alone
and
without
paying
heed
to
any
advice
about
her
journey
she
departed
from
the
house
and
made
great
haste
to
kyoto
reaching
the
quarter
sanjo
in
the
city
of
kyoto
she
asked
the
way
to
the
street
kajiyamachi
which
is
the
street
of
the
smiths
and
finding
it
she
saw
three
smithies
side
by
side
going
to
the
middle
one
she
greeted
the
smith
and
asked
him
sir
smith
can
you
make
some
fine
small
work
in
iron
and
he
answered
ay
lady
that
i
can
then
she
said
make
me
i
pray
you
nine
and
forty
nails
without
heads
but
he
answered
i
am
of
the
seventh
generation
of
a
family
of
smiths
yet
never
did
i
hear
till
now
of
nails
without
heads
and
such
an
order
i
can
not
take
it
were
better
that
you
should
ask
elsewhere
nay
said
she
since
i
came
first
to
you
i
do
not
want
to
go
elsewhere
make
them
for
me
i
pray
sir
smith
he
answered
of
a
truth
if
i
make
such
nails
i
must
be
paid
a
thousand
ryo
she
replied
to
him
if
you
make
them
all
for
me
i
care
nothing
whether
you
desire
one
thousand
or
two
thousand
ryo
make
them
i
beseech
you
sir
smith
so
the
smith
could
not
well
refuse
to
make
the
nails
he
arranged
all
things
rightly
to
honor
the
god
of
the
bellows
then
taking
up
his
first
hammer
he
recited
the
taking
up
his
second
he
recited
the
taking
up
his
third
he
recited
the
because
he
feared
those
nails
might
be
used
for
a
wicked
purpose
thus
in
sorrow
he
finished
the
nails
then
was
the
woman
much
pleased
and
receiving
the
nails
in
her
left
hand
she
paid
the
money
to
the
smith
with
her
right
and
bade
him
farewell
and
went
upon
her
way
when
she
was
gone
then
the
smith
thought
surely
i
have
in
gold
koban
the
sum
of
a
thousand
ryo
but
this
life
of
ours
is
only
like
the
of
a
traveler
journeying
and
i
must
show
to
others
some
pity
and
kindness
to
those
who
are
cold
i
will
give
clothing
and
to
those
who
are
hungry
i
will
give
food
and
by
announcing
his
intention
in
writings
set
up
at
the
boundaries
of
provinces
and
at
the
limits
of
villages
he
was
able
to
show
his
benevolence
to
many
people
on
her
way
the
woman
stopped
at
the
house
of
a
painter
and
asked
the
painter
to
paint
for
her
a
picture
and
the
painter
questioned
her
sayings
shall
i
paint
you
the
picture
of
a
very
old
or
of
an
ancient
pine
she
said
to
him
no
i
want
neither
the
picture
of
an
old
nor
of
an
ancient
pine
i
want
the
picture
of
a
boy
of
sixteen
years
having
a
stature
of
five
feet
and
two
moles
upon
his
face
that
said
the
painter
will
be
an
easy
thing
to
paint
and
he
made
the
picture
in
a
very
little
time
it
was
much
like
and
the
woman
rejoiced
as
she
departed
with
that
picture
of
shuntoku
she
hastened
to
kiyomidzu
and
she
pasted
the
picture
upon
one
of
the
pillars
in
the
rear
of
the
temple
and
with
out
of
the
nails
she
nailed
the
picture
to
the
pillar
and
with
the
two
remaining
nails
she
nailed
the
eyes
then
feeling
assured
that
she
had
put
a
curse
upon
shuntoku
that
wicked
woman
went
home
and
she
said
humbly
i
have
returned
and
she
pretended
to
be
faithful
and
true
these
numbers
simply
indicate
a
great
multitude
in
the
language
of
the
people
they
have
no
exact
significance
kago
a
kind
of
palanquin
the
ancient
ryo
or
tael
had
a
value
approximating
that
of
the
dollar
of
fuigo
sama
deity
of
smiths
diamond
sutra
koban
a
gold
coin
there
were
koban
of
a
great
many
curious
shapes
and
designs
the
most
common
form
was
a
flat
or
oval
disk
stamped
with
chinese
characters
some
koban
were
fully
five
inches
in
length
by
four
in
width
public
announcements
are
usually
written
upon
small
wooden
tablets
attached
to
a
post
and
in
the
country
such
announcements
are
still
set
up
just
as
suggested
in
the
ballad
now
three
or
four
months
after
the
stepmother
of
shuntoku
had
thus
invoked
evil
upon
him
he
became
very
sick
then
that
stepmother
secretly
rejoiced
and
she
spoke
cunningly
to
nobuyoshi
her
husband
saying
sir
my
lord
this
sickness
of
shuntoku
seems
to
be
a
very
bad
sickness
and
it
is
difficult
to
keep
one
having
such
sickness
in
the
house
of
a
rich
man
then
nobuyoshi
was
much
surprised
and
sorrowed
greatly
but
thinking
to
himself
that
indeed
it
could
not
be
helped
he
called
shuntoku
to
him
and
said
son
this
sickness
which
you
have
seems
to
be
leprosy
and
one
having
such
a
sickness
can
not
continue
to
dwell
in
this
house
it
were
best
for
you
therefore
to
make
a
pilgrimage
through
all
the
provinces
in
the
hope
that
you
may
be
healed
by
divine
influence
and
my
storehouses
and
my
granaries
i
will
not
give
to
but
only
to
you
shuntoku
so
you
must
come
back
to
us
poor
shuntoku
not
knowing
how
wicked
his
stepmother
was
besought
her
in
his
sad
condition
saying
dear
mother
i
have
been
told
that
i
must
go
forth
and
wander
as
a
pilgrim
but
now
i
am
blind
and
i
can
not
travel
without
difficulty
i
should
be
content
with
one
meal
a
day
in
place
of
three
and
glad
for
permission
to
live
in
a
corner
of
some
storeroom
or
outhouse
but
i
should
like
to
remain
somewhere
near
my
home
will
you
not
please
permit
me
to
stay
if
only
for
a
little
time
honored
mother
i
beseech
you
let
me
stay
but
she
answered
as
this
trouble
which
you
now
have
is
only
the
beginning
of
the
bad
disease
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
suffer
you
to
stay
you
must
go
away
from
the
house
at
once
then
shuntoku
was
forced
out
of
the
house
by
the
servants
and
into
the
yard
sorrowing
greatly
and
the
wicked
stepmother
following
cried
out
as
your
father
has
commanded
you
must
go
away
at
once
shuntoku
shuntoku
answered
see
i
have
not
even
a
a
pilgrim
gown
and
leggings
i
ought
to
have
and
a
wallet
for
begging
at
hearing
these
words
the
wicked
stepmother
was
glad
and
she
at
once
gave
him
all
that
he
required
shuntoku
received
the
things
and
thanked
her
and
made
ready
to
depart
even
in
his
piteous
state
he
put
on
the
gown
and
hung
a
wooden
mamori
charm
upon
his
breast
and
he
suspended
the
wallet
about
his
neck
he
put
on
his
straw
sandals
and
fastened
them
tightly
and
took
a
bamboo
staff
in
his
hand
and
placed
a
hat
of
woven
rushes
upon
his
head
and
saying
farewell
father
farewell
mother
poor
shuntoku
started
on
his
journey
sorrowfully
nobuyoshi
accompanied
his
son
a
part
of
the
way
saying
it
can
not
be
helped
shuntoku
but
if
through
the
divine
favor
of
those
august
deities
to
whom
that
charm
is
dedicated
your
disease
should
become
cured
then
come
back
to
us
at
once
my
son
hearing
from
his
father
these
kind
words
of
farewell
shuntoku
felt
much
happier
and
covering
his
face
with
the
great
rush
hat
so
as
not
to
be
known
to
the
neighbors
he
went
on
alone
but
in
a
little
while
finding
his
limbs
so
weak
that
he
was
afraid
he
could
not
go
far
and
feeling
his
heart
always
drawn
back
toward
his
home
so
that
he
could
not
help
often
stopping
and
turning
his
face
thither
he
became
sad
again

notes
on
some
minor
japanese
religious
practices
for
full
details
of
pilgrimages
and
pilgrim
costumes
in
journal
of
the
anthropological
institute
the
paper
is
excellently
illustrated
since
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
enter
any
dwelling
he
had
often
to
sleep
under
or
in
the
forests
but
sometimes
he
was
lucky
enough
to
find
shelter
in
some
wayside
shrine
containing
images
of
the
buddhas
and
once
in
the
darkness
of
the
morning
before
the
breaking
of
the
day
in
the
hour
when
the
crows
first
begin
to
fly
abroad
and
cry
the
dead
mother
of
shuntoku
came
to
him
in
a
dream
and
she
said
to
him
son
your
affliction
has
been
caused
by
the
witchcraft
of
your
wicked
stepmother
go
now
to
the
divinity
of
kiyomidzu
and
beseech
the
goddess
that
you
may
be
healed
shuntoku
arose
wondering
and
took
his
way
toward
the
city
of
kyoto
toward
the
temple
of
kiyomidzu
one
day
as
he
traveled
he
went
to
the
gate
of
the
house
of
a
rich
man
named
hagiyama
crying
out
loudly
alms
alms
then
a
maid
servant
of
the
house
hearing
the
cry
came
out
and
gave
him
food
and
laughed
aloud
saying
who
could
help
laughing
at
the
idea
of
trying
to
give
anything
to
so
comical
a
pilgrim
shuntoku
asked
why
do
you
laugh
i
am
the
son
of
a
rich
and
man
nobuyoshi
of
kawachi
but
because
of
a
malediction
invoked
upon
me
by
my
wicked
stepmother
i
have
become
as
you
see
me
then
otohime
a
daughter
of
that
family
hearing
the
voices
came
out
and
asked
the
maid
why
did
you
laugh
the
servant
answered
oh
my
lady
there
was
a
blind
man
from
kawachi
who
seemed
about
twenty
years
old
clinging
to
the
pillar
of
the
gate
and
loudly
crying
alms
so
i
tried
to
give
him
some
clean
rice
upon
a
tray
but
when
i
held
out
the
tray
toward
his
right
hand
he
advanced
his
left
and
when
i
held
out
the
tray
toward
his
left
hand
he
advanced
his
right
that
was
the
reason
i
could
not
help
laughing
hearing
the
maid
explaining
thus
to
the
young
lady
the
blind
man
became
angry
and
said
you
have
no
right
to
despise
strangers
i
am
the
son
of
a
rich
and
man
in
kawachi
and
i
am
called
then
the
daughter
of
that
house
otohime
suddenly
remembering
him
also
became
quite
angry
and
said
to
the
servant
you
must
not
laugh
rudely
laughing
at
others
you
might
be
laughed
at
yourself
but
otohime
had
been
so
startled
that
she
could
not
help
trembling
a
little
and
retiring
to
her
room
she
suddenly
fainted
away
then
in
the
house
all
was
confusion
and
a
doctor
was
summoned
in
great
baste
but
the
girl
being
quite
unable
to
take
any
medicine
only
became
weaker
and
weaker
then
many
famous
physicians
were
sent
for
and
they
consulted
together
about
otohime
and
they
decided
at
last
that
her
sickness
had
been
caused
only
by
some
sudden
sorrow
so
the
mother
said
to
her
sick
daughter
tell
me
without
concealment
if
you
have
any
secret
grief
and
if
there
be
anything
you
want
whatever
it
be
i
will
try
to
get
it
for
you
otohime
replied
i
am
very
much
ashamed
but
i
shall
tell
you
what
i
wish
the
blind
man
who
came
here
the
other
day
was
the
son
of
a
rich
and
citizen
of
kawachi
called
nobuyoshi
at
the
time
of
the
festival
of
tenjin
at
kitano
in
kyoto
i
met
that
young
man
there
on
my
way
to
the
temple
and
we
then
exchanged
letters
of
love
pledging
ourselves
to
each
other
and
therefore
i
very
much
wish
that
i
may
be
allowed
to
travel
in
search
of
him
until
i
find
him
wherever
he
may
be
the
mother
kindly
made
answer
that
indeed
will
be
well
if
you
wish
for
a
kago
you
may
have
one
or
if
you
would
like
to
have
a
horse
you
can
have
one
you
can
choose
any
servant
you
like
to
accompany
you
and
i
can
let
you
have
as
many
koban
as
you
desire
otohime
answered
neither
horse
nor
kago
do
i
need
nor
any
servant
i
need
only
the
dress
of
a
pilgrim
leggings
and
gown
and
a
mendicant
wallet
for
otohime
held
it
her
duty
to
set
out
by
herself
all
alone
just
as
shuntoku
had
done
so
she
left
home
saying
farewell
to
her
parents
with
eyes
full
of
tears
scarcely
could
she
find
voice
to
utter
the
word
over
mountains
and
mountains
she
passed
and
again
over
mountains
hearing
only
the
cries
of
wild
deer
and
the
sound
of
sometimes
she
would
lose
her
way
sometimes
she
would
pursue
alone
a
steep
and
difficult
path
always
she
journeyed
sorrowing
at
last
she
saw
before
her
far
far
away
the
called
and
the
two
rocks
called
ota
and
when
she
saw
those
rocks
she
thought
of
shuntoku
with
love
and
hope
hastening
on
she
met
five
or
six
persona
going
to
kumano
and
she
asked
them
have
you
not
met
on
your
way
a
blind
youth
about
sixteen
years
old
they
made
answer
no
not
yet
but
should
we
meet
him
anywhere
we
will
tell
him
whatever
you
wish
this
reply
greatly
disappointed
otohime
and
she
began
to
think
that
all
her
efforts
to
find
her
lover
might
be
in
vain
and
she
became
very
sad
at
last
she
became
so
end
that
she
resolved
not
to
try
to
find
him
in
this
world
anymore
but
to
drown
herself
at
once
in
the
pool
of
sawara
that
she
might
be
able
to
meet
him
in
a
future
state
she
hurried
there
as
fast
as
she
could
and
when
she
reached
the
pond
she
fixed
her
pilgrim
staff
in
the
ground
and
hung
her
outer
robe
on
a
and
threw
away
her
wallet
and
loosening
her
hair
arranged
it
in
the
style
called
shimada
then
having
filled
her
sleeves
with
stones
she
was
about
to
leap
into
the
water
when
there
appeared
suddenly
before
her
a
venerable
man
of
seemingly
not
less
than
eighty
years
robed
all
in
white
and
bearing
a
tablet
in
his
hand
and
the
aged
man
said
to
her
be
not
thus
in
haste
to
die
otohime
shuntoku
whom
you
seek
is
at
kiyomidzu
san
go
thither
and
meet
him
these
were
indeed
the
happiest
tidings
she
could
have
desired
and
she
became
at
once
very
happy
and
she
knew
she
had
thus
been
saved
by
the
august
favor
of
her
guardian
deity
and
that
it
was
the
god
himself
who
had
spoken
to
her
those
words
so
she
cast
away
the
stones
she
had
put
into
her
sleeves
and
donned
again
the
outer
robe
she
had
taken
off
and
rearranged
her
hair
and
took
her
way
in
all
haste
to
the
temple
of
kiyomidzu
one
meaning
of
ota
in
japanese
is
has
met
or
have
met
the
simple
style
in
which
the
hair
of
dead
woman
is
arranged
see
chapter
of
women
hair
in
glimpses
of
unfamiliar
japan
vol
ii
at
last
she
reached
the
temple
she
ascended
the
three
lower
steps
and
glancing
beneath
a
porch
she
saw
her
lover
shuntoku
lying
there
asleep
covered
with
a
straw
mat
and
she
called
to
him
moshi
moshi
shuntoku
thus
being
suddenly
awakened
seized
his
staff
which
was
lying
by
his
side
and
cried
out
every
day
the
children
of
this
neighborhood
come
here
and
annoy
me
because
i
am
blind
otohime
hearing
these
words
and
feeling
great
sorrow
approached
and
laid
her
hands
on
her
poor
lover
and
said
to
him
i
am
not
one
of
those
bad
mischievous
children
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
wealthy
hagiyama
and
because
i
promised
myself
to
you
at
the
festival
of
kitano
tenjin
in
kyoto
i
have
come
here
to
see
you
astonished
at
hearing
the
voice
of
his
shuntoku
rose
up
quickly
and
cried
out
oh
are
you
really
otohime
it
is
a
long
time
since
we
last
met
but
this
is
so
strange
is
it
not
all
a
lie
and
then
stroking
each
other
they
could
only
cry
instead
of
speaking
but
presently
shuntoku
giving
way
to
the
excitement
of
his
grief
cried
out
to
otohime
a
malediction
has
been
laid
upon
me
by
my
stepmother
and
my
appearance
has
been
changed
as
you
see
therefore
never
can
i
be
united
to
you
as
your
husband
even
as
i
now
am
so
must
i
remain
until
i
fester
to
death
and
so
you
must
go
beck
home
at
once
and
live
in
happiness
and
splendor
but
she
answered
in
great
sorrow
never
are
you
really
in
earnest
are
you
truly
in
your
right
senses
no
no
i
have
disguised
myself
thus
only
because
i
loved
you
enough
even
to
give
my
life
for
you
and
now
i
will
never
leave
yea
no
matter
what
may
become
of
me
in
the
future
shuntoku
was
comforted
by
these
words
but
he
was
also
filled
with
pity
for
her
so
that
he
wept
without
being
able
to
speak
a
word
then
she
said
to
him
since
your
wicked
stepmother
bewitched
you
only
because
you
were
rich
i
am
not
afraid
to
revenge
you
by
bewitching
her
also
for
i
too
am
the
child
of
a
rich
man
and
then
with
her
whole
heart
she
spoke
thus
to
the
divinity
within
the
temple
for
the
space
of
seven
days
and
seven
nights
i
shall
remain
fasting
in
this
temple
to
prove
my
vow
and
if
you
have
any
truth
and
pity
i
beseech
you
to
save
us
for
so
great
a
building
as
this
a
thatched
roof
is
not
the
proper
roof
i
will
it
with
feathers
of
little
birds
and
the
ridge
of
the
roof
i
will
cover
with
of
falcons
this
torii
and
these
lanterns
of
stone
are
ugly
i
will
erect
a
torii
of
gold
and
i
will
make
a
thousand
lamps
of
gold
and
a
thousand
of
silver
and
every
evening
i
will
light
them
in
so
large
a
garden
as
this
there
should
be
trees
i
will
plant
a
thousand
hinoki
a
thousand
sugi
a
thousand
karamatsu
but
if
shuntoku
should
not
be
healed
by
reason
of
this
vow
then
he
and
i
will
drown
ourselves
together
in
yonder
and
after
our
death
taking
the
form
of
two
great
serpents
we
will
torment
all
who
come
to
worship
at
this
temple
and
bar
the
way
against
pilgrims
an
exclamation
uttered
to
call
the
attention
of
another
to
the
presence
of
the
speaker
from
the
respectful
verb
to
say
our
colloquial
say
does
not
give
the
proper
meaning
our
please
comes
nearer
to
it
now
strange
to
say
on
the
night
of
the
seventh
day
after
she
had
vowed
this
vow
there
came
to
her
in
a
dream
who
said
to
her
the
prayer
which
you
prayed
i
shall
grant
forthwith
otohime
awoke
and
told
her
dream
to
shuntoku
and
they
both
wondered
they
arose
and
went
down
to
the
river
together
and
washed
themselves
and
worshiped
the
goddess
then
strange
to
say
the
eyes
of
blind
shuntoku
were
fully
opened
and
his
clear
sight
came
back
to
him
and
the
disease
passed
away
from
him
and
both
wept
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
joy
together
they
sought
an
inn
and
there
laid
aside
their
and
put
on
fresh
robes
and
hired
kago
and
carriers
to
bear
them
home
reaching
the
house
of
his
father
shuntoku
cried
out
honored
parents
i
have
returned
to
you
by
virtue
of
the
written
charm
upon
the
sacred
tablet
i
have
been
healed
of
my
sickness
as
you
may
see
is
all
well
with
you
honored
parents
and
shuntoku
father
hearing
ran
out
and
cried
oh
how
much
troubled
i
have
been
for
your
sake
never
for
one
moment
could
i
cease
to
think
of
you
but
now
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
and
the
bride
you
have
brought
with
you
and
all
rejoiced
together
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
very
strange
that
the
wicked
stepmother
at
the
same
moment
became
suddenly
blind
and
that
her
fingers
and
her
toes
began
to
rot
so
that
she
was
in
great
torment
then
the
bride
and
the
bridegroom
said
to
that
wicked
stepmother
lo
the
leprosy
has
come
upon
you
we
can
not
keep
a
leper
in
the
house
of
a
rich
man
please
to
go
away
at
once
we
shall
give
you
a
pilgrim
gown
and
leggings
a
rush
hat
and
a
staff
for
we
have
all
these
things
ready
here
then
the
wicked
stepmother
knew
that
even
to
save
her
from
death
it
could
not
be
helped
because
she
herself
had
done
so
wicked
a
thing
before
shuntoku
and
his
wife
were
very
glad
how
rejoiced
they
were
the
stepmother
prayed
them
to
allow
her
only
one
small
meal
a
day
just
as
shuntoku
had
done
but
otohime
said
to
the
stricken
woman
we
can
not
keep
you
here
not
even
in
the
corner
of
an
outhouse
go
away
at
once
also
nobuyoshi
said
to
his
wicked
wife
what
do
you
mean
by
remaining
here
how
long
do
you
require
to
go
and
he
drove
her
out
and
she
could
not
help
herself
and
she
went
away
crying
and
striving
to
hide
her
face
from
the
sight
of
the
neighbors
otowaka
led
his
blind
mother
by
the
hand
and
together
they
went
to
kyoto
and
to
the
temple
of
kiyomidzu
when
they
got
there
they
ascended
three
of
the
temple
steps
and
knelt
down
and
prayed
the
goddess
saying
give
us
power
to
cast
another
malediction
but
the
goddess
suddenly
appeared
before
them
and
said
were
it
a
good
thing
that
you
pray
for
i
would
grant
your
prayer
but
with
an
evil
matter
i
will
have
no
more
to
do
if
you
must
die
then
die
there
and
after
your
death
you
shall
be
sent
to
hell
and
there
put
into
the
bottom
of
an
iron
caldron
to
be
boiled
is
the
end
of
the
story
of
shuntoku
with
a
jubilant
tap
of
the
fan
we
finish
so
joyfully
the
ballad
of
tell
every
word
of
the
tale
this
is
the
story
of
i
the
birth
the
famed
takakura
dainagon
whose
other
name
was
was
so
rich
that
he
had
in
every
direction
he
owned
one
precious
stone
that
had
power
over
fire
and
another
that
had
power
over
water
he
also
had
the
claws
of
a
tiger
extracted
from
the
paws
of
the
living
animal
he
had
the
horns
of
a
colt
and
he
likewise
owned
even
a
of
all
that
a
man
might
have
in
this
world
he
wanted
nothing
except
an
heir
and
he
had
no
other
cause
for
sorrow
a
trusted
servant
in
his
house
named
ikenoshoji
said
at
last
to
him
these
words
seeing
that
the
buddhist
deity
enshrined
upon
the
holy
mountain
of
kurama
is
famed
for
his
divine
favor
far
and
near
i
respectfully
entreat
you
to
go
to
that
temple
and
make
prayer
to
him
for
then
your
wish
will
surely
be
fulfilled
to
this
the
master
agreed
and
at
once
began
to
make
preparation
for
a
journey
to
the
temple
as
he
traveled
with
great
speed
he
reached
the
temple
very
soon
and
there
having
purified
his
body
by
pouring
water
over
it
he
prayed
with
all
his
heart
for
an
heir
and
during
three
days
and
three
nights
he
abstained
from
food
of
every
sort
but
all
seemed
in
vain
wherefore
the
lord
despairing
because
of
the
silence
of
the
god
resolved
to
perform
in
the
temple
and
so
to
defile
the
sacred
building
moreover
he
resolved
that
his
spirit
after
his
death
should
haunt
the
mountain
of
kurama
to
deter
and
terrify
all
pilgrims
upon
the
path
of
the
mountain
the
delay
of
even
one
moment
would
have
been
fatal
but
good
ikenoshoji
came
running
to
the
place
just
in
time
and
prevented
the
seppuku
oh
my
lord
the
retainer
cried
you
are
surely
too
hasty
in
your
resolve
to
die
rather
first
suffer
me
to
try
my
fortune
and
see
if
i
may
not
be
able
to
offer
up
prayer
for
your
sake
with
more
success
then
after
having
times
purified
his
body
seven
times
washing
with
hot
water
seven
times
with
cold
and
yet
another
seven
times
washing
himself
with
a
bundle
of
he
thus
prayed
to
the
god
if
to
my
lord
an
heir
be
given
by
the
divine
favor
then
i
vow
that
i
will
make
offering
of
of
bronze
wherewith
to
pave
this
temple
court
also
of
lanterns
of
bronze
to
stand
in
rows
without
the
temple
and
of
plating
of
pure
gold
and
pure
silver
to
cover
all
the
pillars
within
and
upon
the
third
of
the
three
nights
which
he
passed
in
prayer
before
the
god
revealed
himself
to
the
pious
ikenoshoji
and
said
to
him
earnestly
wishing
to
grant
your
petition
i
sought
far
and
near
for
a
fitting
heir
even
as
far
as
tenjiku
india
and
kara
china
but
though
human
beings
are
numerous
as
the
stars
in
the
sky
or
the
countless
pebbles
upon
the
shore
i
was
grieved
that
i
could
not
find
of
the
seed
of
man
one
heir
that
might
well
be
given
to
your
master
and
at
last
knowing
not
what
else
to
do
i
took
away
by
stealth
the
spirit
of
one
of
the
eight
children
whose
father
was
one
of
the
residing
on
the
peak
far
among
the
dandoku
mountains
and
that
child
i
will
give
to
become
the
heir
of
your
master
having
thus
spoken
the
deity
retired
within
the
innermost
shrine
then
ikenoshoji
starting
from
his
real
dream
nine
times
prostrated
himself
before
the
god
and
hastened
to
the
dwelling
of
his
master
erelong
the
wife
of
takakura
dainagon
found
herself
with
child
and
after
the
ten
happy
months
she
bore
a
son
with
painless
labor
it
was
strange
that
the
infant
had
upon
his
forehead
marked
quite
plainly
and
naturally
the
chinese
character
for
rice
and
it
was
yet
more
strange
to
find
that
in
his
eyes
four
buddhas
were
reflected
ikenoshoji
and
the
parents
rejoiced
and
the
name
young
ari
was
given
the
child
after
the
name
of
the
mountain
on
the
third
day
after
the
birth
is
the
translation
given
by
some
dictionaries
was
suggested
by
my
translator
but
as
some
mythological
animal
is
evidently
meant
i
thought
it
better
to
translate
the
word
literally
the
chinese
term
for
harakiri
it
is
thought
to
be
the
more
refined
word
the
four
deva
kings
of
buddhism
who
guard
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
that
is
ten
by
the
ancient
native
manner
of
reckoning
time
literally
a
buddha
the
image
in
the
eye
is
called
the
buddha
the
idea
here
expressed
seems
to
be
that
the
eyes
of
the
child
reflected
four
instead
of
two
images
children
of
supernatural
beings
were
popularly
said
to
have
double
pupils
but
i
am
giving
only
a
popular
explanation
of
the
term
ii
the
banishment
very
quickly
the
child
grew
and
when
he
became
fifteen
the
reigning
emperor
gave
him
the
name
and
title
of
when
he
reached
manhood
his
father
resolved
to
get
him
a
bride
so
the
dainagon
looked
upon
all
the
daughters
of
the
ministers
and
high
officials
but
he
found
none
that
he
thought
worthy
to
become
the
wife
of
his
son
but
the
young
hangwan
learning
that
he
himself
had
been
a
gift
to
his
parents
from
resolved
to
pray
to
that
deity
for
a
spouse
and
he
hastened
to
the
temple
of
the
divinity
accompanied
by
ikenoshoji
there
they
washed
their
hands
and
rinsed
their
mouths
and
remained
three
nights
without
sleep
passing
all
the
time
in
religious
exercises
but
as
they
had
no
companions
the
young
prince
at
last
felt
very
lonesome
and
began
to
play
on
his
flute
made
of
the
root
of
the
bamboo
seemingly
charmed
by
these
sweet
sounds
the
great
serpent
that
lived
in
the
temple
pond
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
temple
transforming
its
fearful
shape
into
the
likeness
of
a
lovely
female
attendant
of
the
imperial
court
and
fondly
listened
to
the
melody
then
thought
he
saw
before
him
the
very
lady
he
desired
for
a
wife
and
thinking
also
that
she
was
the
one
chosen
for
him
by
the
deity
he
placed
the
beautiful
being
in
a
palanquin
and
returned
to
his
home
but
no
sooner
had
this
happened
than
a
fearful
storm
burst
upon
the
capital
followed
by
a
great
flood
and
the
flood
and
the
storm
both
lasted
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
the
emperor
was
troubled
greatly
by
these
omens
and
he
sent
for
the
astrologers
that
they
might
explain
the
causes
thereof
they
said
in
answer
to
the
questions
asked
of
them
that
the
terrible
weather
was
caused
only
by
the
anger
of
the
male
serpent
seeking
vengeance
for
the
loss
of
its
mate
which
was
none
other
than
the
fair
woman
that
had
brought
back
with
him
whereupon
the
emperor
commanded
that
should
be
banished
to
the
province
of
hitachi
and
that
the
transformed
female
serpent
should
at
once
be
taken
back
to
the
pond
upon
the
mountain
of
kurama
and
being
thus
compelled
by
imperial
order
to
depart
went
away
to
the
province
of
hitachi
followed
only
by
his
faithful
retainer
ikenoshoji
iii
the
exchange
of
letters
only
a
little
while
after
the
banishment
of
a
traveling
merchant
seeking
to
sell
his
wares
visited
the
house
of
the
exiled
prince
at
hitachi
and
being
asked
by
the
hangwan
where
he
lived
the
merchant
made
answer
saying
i
live
in
kyoto
in
the
street
called
muromachi
and
my
name
is
goto
sayemon
my
stock
consists
of
goods
of
one
thousand
and
eight
different
kinds
which
i
send
to
china
of
one
thousand
and
eight
kinds
which
i
send
to
india
and
yet
another
thousand
and
eight
kinds
which
i
sell
only
in
japan
so
that
my
whole
stock
consists
of
three
thousand
and
different
kinds
of
goods
concerning
the
countries
to
which
i
have
already
been
i
may
answer
that
i
made
three
voyages
to
india
and
three
to
china
and
this
is
my
seventh
journey
to
this
part
of
japan
having
heard
these
things
asked
the
merchant
whether
he
knew
of
any
young
girl
who
would
make
a
worthy
wife
since
he
the
prince
being
still
unmarried
desired
to
find
such
a
girl
then
said
sayemon
in
the
province
of
sagami
to
the
west
of
us
there
lives
a
rich
man
called
tokoyama
choja
who
has
eight
sons
long
he
lamented
that
he
had
no
daughter
and
he
long
prayed
for
a
daughter
to
the
august
sun
and
a
daughter
was
given
him
and
after
her
birth
her
parents
thought
it
behoved
them
to
give
her
a
higher
rank
than
their
own
because
her
birth
had
come
to
pass
through
the
divine
influence
of
the
august
deity
so
they
built
for
her
a
separate
dwelling
she
is
in
very
truth
superior
to
all
other
japanese
women
nor
can
i
think
of
any
other
person
in
every
manner
worthy
of
you
this
story
much
pleased
and
he
at
once
asked
sayemon
to
act
the
part
of
for
him
and
sayemon
promised
to
do
everything
in
his
power
to
fulfill
the
wish
of
the
hangwan
then
called
for
inkstone
and
and
wrote
a
and
tied
it
up
with
such
a
knot
as
are
tied
with
and
he
gave
it
to
the
merchant
to
be
delivered
to
the
lady
and
he
gave
him
also
in
reward
for
his
services
one
hundred
golden
ryo
sayemon
again
and
again
prostrated
himself
in
thanks
and
he
put
the
letter
into
the
box
which
he
always
carried
with
him
and
then
he
lifted
the
box
upon
his
back
and
bade
the
prince
now
although
the
journey
from
hitachi
to
sagami
is
commonly
a
journey
of
seven
days
the
merchant
arrived
there
at
noon
upon
the
third
day
having
traveled
in
all
haste
night
and
day
together
without
stopping
and
he
went
to
the
building
called
which
had
been
built
by
the
rich
yokoyama
for
the
sake
of
his
only
daughter
in
the
district
of
soba
in
the
province
of
sagami
and
he
asked
permission
to
enter
therein
but
the
stern
bade
him
go
away
announcing
that
the
dwelling
was
the
dwelling
of
daughter
of
the
famed
choja
yokoyama
and
that
no
person
of
the
male
sex
whosoever
could
be
permitted
to
enter
and
furthermore
that
guards
had
been
appointed
to
guard
the
palace
ten
by
night
and
ten
by
day
with
extreme
caution
and
severity
but
the
merchant
told
the
that
he
was
goto
sayemon
of
the
street
called
muromachi
in
the
city
of
kyoto
that
he
was
a
merchant
there
and
was
by
the
people
called
sendanya
that
he
had
thrice
been
to
india
and
thrice
to
china
and
was
now
upon
his
seventh
return
journey
to
the
great
country
of
the
rising
sun
and
he
said
also
to
them
into
all
the
palaces
of
nihon
save
this
one
only
i
have
been
freely
admitted
so
i
shall
be
deeply
grateful
to
you
if
you
permit
me
to
enter
thus
saying
he
produced
many
rolls
of
silk
and
presented
them
to
the
and
their
cupidity
made
them
blind
and
the
merchant
without
more
difficulty
entered
rejoicing
through
the
great
outer
gate
he
passed
and
over
a
bridge
and
then
found
himself
in
front
of
the
chambers
of
the
female
attendants
of
the
superior
class
and
he
called
out
with
a
very
loud
voice
o
my
ladies
all
things
that
you
may
require
i
have
here
with
me
i
have
all
i
have
and
needles
and
tweezers
i
have
and
combs
of
silver
and
from
nagasaki
and
even
all
kinds
of
chinese
mirrors
whereupon
the
ladies
delighted
with
the
idea
of
seeing
these
things
suffered
the
merchant
to
enter
their
apartment
which
he
presently
made
to
look
like
a
shop
for
the
sale
of
female
toilet

nakodo
the
profession
of
nakodo
exists
but
any
person
who
arranges
marriages
for
a
consideration
is
for
the
time
being
called
the
nakodo
but
while
making
bargains
and
selling
very
quickly
sayemon
did
not
lose
the
good
chance
offered
him
and
taking
from
his
box
the
which
had
been
confided
to
him
he
said
to
the
ladies
this
letter
if
i
remember
rightly
i
picked
up
in
some
town
in
hitachi
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
will
accept
it
either
to
use
it
for
a
model
if
it
be
written
beautifully
or
to
laugh
at
if
it
prove
to
have
been
written
awkwardly
then
the
chief
among
the
maids
receiving
the
letter
tried
to
read
the
writing
upon
the
envelope
tsuki
ni
hoshi
ame
ni
arare
ga
kori
kana
which
signified
moon
and
stars
rain
and
hail
make
ice
but
she
could
not
read
the
riddle
of
the
mysterious
words
the
other
ladies
who
were
also
unable
to
guess
the
meaning
of
the
words
could
not
but
laugh
and
they
laughed
so
shrilly
that
the
princess
terute
heard
and
came
among
them
fully
robed
and
wearing
a
veil
over
her
hair
and
the
having
been
rolled
up
before
her
asked
what
is
the
cause
of
all
this
laughing
if
there
be
anything
amusing
i
wish
that
you
will
let
me
share
in
the
amusement
the
maids
then
answered
saying
we
were
laughing
only
at
our
being
unable
to
read
a
letter
which
this
merchant
from
the
capital
says
that
he
picked
up
in
some
street
and
here
is
the
letter
even
the
address
upon
it
is
a
riddle
to
us
and
the
letter
having
been
laid
upon
an
open
crimson
fan
was
properly
presented
to
the
princess
who
received
it
and
admired
the
beauty
of
the
writing
and
said
never
have
i
seen
so
beautiful
a
hand
as
this
it
is
like
the
writing
of
kobodaishi
himself
or
of
monju
bosatsu
perhaps
the
writer
is
one
of
those
princes
of
the
ichijo
or
nijo
or
sanjo
families
all
famed
for
their
skill
in
writing
or
if
this
guess
of
mine
be
wrong
then
i
should
say
that
these
characters
have
certainly
been
written
by
now
so
famed
in
the
province
of
hitachi
i
shall
read
the
letter
for
you
then
the
envelope
was
removed
and
the
first
phrase
she
read
was
no
the
mountain
of
fuji
which
she
interpreted
as
signifying
loftiness
of
rank
and
then
she
met
with
such
phrases
as
these
the
name
of
a
place
ni
hail
on
the
leaves
of
the
ni
hail
following
upon
a
wooden
roof
ni
ice
in
the
sleeve
ni
pure
water
running
through
a
moor
ni
rushes
in
a
little
pond
ni
dew
on
the
leaves
of
the
taro
a
very
long
girdle
ni
deer
and
a
forked
river
a
round
log
laid
over
a
little
stream
for
a
bridge
yumi
ni
hanuki
a
stringless
bow
and
a
wingless
bird
and
then
she
understood
that
the
characters
signified
they
would
meet
for
he
would
call
upon
her
then
they
would
not
be
separated
they
would
repose
together
and
the
meaning
of
the
rest
was
thus
this
letter
should
be
opened
within
the
sleeve
so
that
others
may
know
nothing
of
it
keep
the
secret
in
your
own
bosom
you
must
yield
to
me
even
as
the
rush
bends
to
the
wind
i
am
earnest
to
serve
you
in
all
things
we
shall
surely
be
united
at
last
whatever
chance
may
separate
us
at
the
beginning
i
wish
for
you
even
as
the
stag
for
its
mate
in
the
autumn
even
though
long
kept
apart
we
shall
meet
as
meet
the
waters
of
a
river
divided
in
its
upper
course
into
two
branches
divine
i
pray
you
the
meaning
of
this
letter
and
preserve
it
i
hope
for
a
fortunate
answer
thinking
of
i
feel
as
though
i
could
fly
and
the
princess
terute
found
at
the
end
of
the
letter
the
name
of
him
who
wrote
it
himself
together
with
her
own
name
as
being
written
to
her
then
she
felt
greatly
troubled
because
she
had
not
at
first
supposed
that
the
letter
was
addressed
to
her
and
had
without
thinking
read
it
aloud
to
the
female
attendants
for
she
well
knew
that
her
father
would
quickly
kill
her
in
a
most
cruel
manner
should
the
choja
come
to
know
the
truth
wherefore
through
fear
of
being
mingled
with
the
earth
of
the
moor
uwanogahara
fitting
place
for
a
father
in
wrath
to
slay
his
daughter
she
set
the
end
of
the
letter
between
her
teeth
and
rent
it
to
pieces
and
withdrew
to
the
inner
apartment
choja
is
not
a
proper
name
it
signifies
really
a
wealthy
man
only
like
the
french
terms
un
richard
un
riche
but
it
is
used
almost
like
a
proper
name
in
the
country
still
the
richest
man
in
the
place
usually
a
person
of
influence
being
often
referred
to
as
the
choja
but
the
merchant
knowing
that
he
could
not
go
back
to
hitachi
without
bearing
some
reply
resolved
to
obtain
one
by
cunning
wherefore
he
hurried
after
the
princess
even
into
her
innermost
apartment
without
so
much
as
waiting
to
remove
his
sandals
and
he
cried
out
loudly
oh
my
princess
i
have
been
taught
that
written
characters
were
invented
in
india
by
monju
bosatsu
and
in
japan
by
kobodaishi
and
is
it
not
like
tearing
the
hands
of
kobodaishi
thus
to
tear
a
letter
written
with
characters
know
you
not
that
a
woman
is
less
pure
than
a
man
wherefore
then
do
you
born
a
woman
thus
presume
to
tear
a
letter
now
if
you
refuse
to
write
a
reply
i
shall
call
upon
all
the
gods
i
shall
announce
to
them
this
unwomanly
act
and
i
shall
invoke
their
malediction
upon
you
and
with
these
words
he
took
from
the
box
which
he
always
carried
with
him
a
buddhist
rosary
and
he
began
to
twist
it
about
with
an
awful
appearance
of
anger
then
the
princess
terute
terrified
and
grieved
prayed
him
to
cease
his
invocations
and
promised
that
she
would
write
an
answer
at
once
so
her
answer
was
quickly
written
and
given
to
the
merchant
who
was
overjoyed
by
his
success
and
speedily
departed
for
hitachi
carrying
his
box
upon
his
back
iv
how
became
a
bridegroom
without
his
consent
traveling
with
great
speed
the
nakodo
quickly
arrived
at
the
dwelling
of
the
hangwan
and
gave
the
letter
to
the
master
who
removed
the
cover
with
hands
that
trembled
for
joy
very
very
short
the
answer
was
only
these
words
naka
a
boat
floating
in
the
offing
but
guessed
the
meaning
to
be
as
fortunes
and
misfortunes
are
common
to
all
be
not
afraid
and
try
to
come
unseen
therewith
he
summoned
ikenoshoji
and
bade
him
make
all
needful
preparation
for
a
rapid
journey
goto
sayemon
consented
to
serve
as
guide
he
accompanied
them
and
when
they
reached
the
district
of
soba
and
were
approaching
the
house
of
the
princess
the
guide
said
to
the
prince
that
house
before
us
with
the
black
gate
is
the
dwelling
of
the
yokoyama
choja
and
that
other
house
to
the
northward
of
it
having
a
red
gate
is
the
residence
of
the
terute
be
prudent
in
all
things
and
you
will
succeed
and
with
these
words
the
guide
disappeared
accompanied
by
his
faithful
retainer
the
hangwan
approached
the
red
gate
both
attempted
to
enter
when
the
sought
to
prevent
them
declaring
they
were
much
too
bold
to
seek
to
enter
the
dwelling
of
only
daughter
of
the
renowned
yokoyama
choja
the
sacred
child
begotten
through
the
favor
of
the
deity
of
the
sun
you
do
but
right
to
speak
thus
the
retainer
made
reply
but
you
must
learn
that
we
are
officers
from
the
city
in
search
of
a
fugitive
and
it
is
just
because
all
males
are
prohibited
from
entering
this
dwelling
that
a
search
therein
must
be
made
then
the
guards
amazed
suffered
them
to
pass
and
saw
the
supposed
officers
of
justice
enter
the
court
and
many
of
the
ladies
in
waiting
come
forth
to
welcome
them
as
guests
and
the
lady
terute
marvelously
pleased
by
the
coming
of
the
writer
of
that
appeared
before
her
wooer
robed
in
her
robes
of
ceremony
with
a
veil
abut
her
shoulders
was
also
much
delighted
at
being
thus
welcomed
by
the
beautiful
maiden
and
the
wedding
ceremony
was
at
once
performed
to
the
great
joy
of
both
and
was
followed
by
a
great
wine
feast
so
great
was
the
mirth
and
so
joyful
were
all
that
the
followers
of
the
prince
and
the
maids
of
the
princess
danced
together
and
together
made
music
and
himself
produced
his
flute
made
of
the
root
of
a
bamboo
and
began
to
play
upon
it
sweetly
then
the
father
of
terute
hearing
all
this
joyous
din
in
the
house
of
his
daughter
wondered
greatly
what
the
cause
might
be
but
when
he
had
been
told
how
the
hangwan
had
become
the
bridegroom
of
his
daughter
without
his
consent
the
choja
grew
wondrous
angry
and
in
secret
devised
a
scheme
of
revenge
the
poisoning
the
next
day
yokoyama
sent
to
prince
a
message
inviting
him
to
come
to
his
house
there
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
greeting
each
other
as
and
then
the
princess
terute
sought
to
dissuade
the
hangwan
from
going
there
because
she
had
dreamed
in
the
night
a
dream
of
ill
omen
but
the
hangwan
making
light
of
her
fears
went
boldly
to
the
dwelling
of
the
choja
followed
by
his
young
retainers
then
yokoyama
choja
rejoicing
caused
many
dishes
to
be
prepared
containing
all
delicacies
furnished
by
the
mountains
and
the
sea
and
well
entertained
the
hangwan
at
last
when
the
began
to
flag
yokoyama
uttered
the
wish
that
his
guest
the
lord
would
also
furnish
some
entertainment
and
what
shall
it
be
the
hangwan
asked
truly
replied
the
choja
i
am
desirous
to
see
you
show
your
great
skill
in
riding
then
i
shall
ride
the
prince
made
answer
and
presently
the
horse
called
onikage
was
led
out
that
horse
was
so
fierce
that
he
did
not
seem
to
be
a
real
horse
but
rather
a
demon
or
a
dragon
so
that
few
dared
even
to
approach
him
but
the
prince
hangwan
at
once
loosened
the
chain
by
which
the
horse
was
fastened
and
rode
upon
him
with
wondrous
ease
in
spite
of
his
fierceness
onikage
found
himself
obliged
to
do
everything
which
his
rider
wished
all
present
yokoyama
and
the
others
could
not
speak
for
astonishment
but
soon
the
choja
taking
and
setting
up
a
screen
asked
to
see
the
prince
ride
his
steed
upon
the
upper
edge
of
the
screen
the
lord
oguri
consenting
rode
upon
the
top
of
the
screen
and
then
he
rode
along
the
top
of
an
upright
shoji
frame
then
a
chessboard
being
set
out
he
rode
upon
it
making
the
horse
rightly
set
his
hoof
upon
the
squares
of
the
chessboard
as
he
rode
and
lastly
he
made
the
steed
balance
himself
upon
the
frame
of
an
andon
then
yokoyama
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
and
he
could
only
say
bowing
low
to
the
prince
truly
i
am
grateful
for
your
entertainment
i
am
very
much
delighted
and
the
lord
oguri
having
attached
onikage
to
a
in
the
garden
reentered
the
apartment
but
saburo
the
third
son
of
the
house
having
persuaded
his
father
to
kill
the
hangwan
with
poisoned
wine
urged
the
prince
to
drink
sake
with
which
there
had
been
mingled
the
venom
of
a
blue
centipede
and
of
a
blue
lizard
and
foul
water
that
had
long
stood
in
the
hollow
joint
of
a
bamboo
and
the
hangwan
and
his
followers
not
suspecting
the
wine
had
been
poisoned
drank
the
whole
sad
to
say
the
poison
entered
into
their
viscera
and
their
intestines
and
all
their
bones
burst
asunder
by
reason
of
the
violence
of
that
poison
or
with
all
strange
flavors
of
mountain
and
sea
the
word
is
really
sakana
fish
it
has
always
been
the
rule
to
serve
fish
with
sake
and
gradually
the
word
fish
became
used
for
any
entertainment
given
during
the
by
guests
such
as
songs
dances
etc
literally
the
term
refers
to
color
a
less
exact
translation
of
the
original
characters
would
be
the
demon
chestnut
kage
also
means
chestnut
a
chestnut
horse
is
a
large
portable
lantern
having
a
wooden
frame
and
paper
sides
there
are
andon
of
many
forms
some
remarkably
beautiful
their
lives
passed
from
them
quickly
as
dew
in
the
morning
from
the
grass
and
saburo
and
his
father
buried
their
corpses
in
the
moor
uwanogahara
vi
cast
adrift
the
cruel
yokoyama
thought
that
it
would
not
do
to
suffer
his
daughter
to
live
after
he
had
thus
killed
her
husband
therefore
he
felt
obliged
to
order
his
faithful
servants
onio
and
oniji
who
were
brothers
to
take
her
far
out
into
the
sea
of
sagami
and
to
drown
her
there
and
the
two
brothers
knowing
their
master
was
too
to
be
persuaded
otherwise
could
do
nothing
but
obey
so
they
went
to
the
unhappy
lady
and
told
her
the
purpose
for
which
they
had
been
sent
was
so
astonished
by
her
father
cruel
decision
that
at
first
she
thought
all
this
was
a
dream
from
which
she
earnestly
prayed
to
be
awakened
after
a
while
she
said
never
in
my
whole
life
have
i
knowingly
committed
any
crime
but
whatever
happen
to
my
own
body
i
am
more
anxious
than
i
can
say
to
learn
what
became
of
my
husband
after
he
visited
my
father
house
our
master
answered
the
two
brothers
becoming
very
angry
at
learning
that
you
two
had
been
wedded
without
his
lawful
permission
poisoned
the
young
prince
according
to
a
plan
devised
by
your
brother
saburo
then
terute
more
and
more
astonished
invoked
with
just
cause
a
malediction
upon
her
father
for
his
cruelty
but
she
was
not
even
allowed
time
to
lament
her
fate
for
onio
and
his
brother
at
once
removed
her
garments
and
put
her
naked
body
into
a
roll
of
rush
matting
when
this
piteous
package
was
carried
out
of
the
house
at
night
the
princess
and
her
bade
each
other
their
last
farewells
with
sobs
and
cries
of
grief
onio
the
king
of
devils
oniji
the
next
greatest
devil
the
brothers
onio
and
oniji
then
rowed
far
out
to
sea
with
their
pitiful
burden
but
when
they
found
themselves
alone
then
oniji
said
to
onio
that
it
were
better
they
should
try
to
save
their
young
mistress
to
this
the
elder
brother
at
once
agreed
without
difficulty
and
both
began
to
think
of
some
plan
to
save
her
just
at
the
same
time
an
empty
canoe
came
near
them
drifting
with
the
at
once
the
lady
was
placed
in
it
and
the
brothers
exclaiming
that
indeed
was
a
fortunate
happening
bade
their
mistress
farewell
and
rowed
back
to
their
master
vii
the
lady
yorihime
the
canoe
bearing
poor
terute
was
tossed
about
by
the
waves
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
during
which
time
there
was
much
wind
and
rain
and
at
last
it
was
discovered
by
some
fishermen
who
were
fishing
near
nawoye
but
they
thought
that
the
beautiful
woman
was
certainly
the
spirit
that
had
caused
the
long
storm
of
many
days
and
terute
might
have
been
killed
by
their
oars
had
not
one
of
the
men
of
nawoye
taken
her
under
his
protection
now
this
man
whose
name
was
murakimi
dayu
resolved
to
adopt
the
princess
as
his
daughter
as
he
had
no
child
of
his
own
to
be
his
heir
so
he
took
her
to
his
home
and
named
her
yorihime
and
treated
her
so
kindly
that
his
wife
grew
jealous
of
the
adopted
daughter
and
therefore
was
often
cruel
to
her
when
the
husband
was
absent
but
being
still
more
angered
to
find
that
yorihime
would
not
go
away
of
her
own
accord
the
woman
began
to
devise
some
means
of
getting
rid
of
her
forever
just
at
that
time
the
ship
of
a
kidnapper
happened
to
cast
anchor
in
the
harbor
needless
to
say
that
yorihime
was
secretly
sold
to
this
dealer
in
human
flesh
viii
becoming
a
servant
after
this
misfortune
the
unhappy
princess
passed
from
one
master
to
another
as
many
as
times
her
last
purchaser
was
one
yorodzuya
chobei
well
known
as
the
keeper
of
a
large
joroya
in
the
province
of
mino
when
was
first
brought
before
this
new
master
she
spoke
meekly
to
him
and
begged
him
to
excuse
her
ignorance
of
all
refinements
and
of
deportment
and
chobei
then
asked
her
to
tell
him
all
about
herself
her
native
place
and
her
family
but
thought
it
would
not
be
wise
to
mention
even
the
name
of
her
native
province
lest
she
might
possibly
be
forced
to
speak
of
the
poisoning
of
her
husband
by
her
own
father
so
she
resolved
to
answer
only
that
she
was
born
in
hitachi
feeling
a
sad
pleasure
in
saying
that
she
belonged
to
the
same
province
in
which
the
lord
hangwan
her
lover
used
to
live
i
was
born
she
said
in
the
province
of
hitachi
but
i
am
of
too
low
birth
to
have
a
family
name
therefore
may
i
beseech
you
to
bestow
some
suitable
name
upon
me
then
was
named
kohagi
of
hitachi
and
she
was
told
that
she
would
have
to
serve
her
master
very
faithfully
in
his
business
but
this
order
she
refused
to
obey
and
said
that
she
would
perform
with
pleasure
any
work
given
her
to
do
however
mean
or
hard
but
that
she
would
never
follow
the
business
of
a
joro
then
cried
chobei
in
anger
your
daily
tasks
shall
be
these
to
feed
all
the
horses
one
hundred
in
number
that
are
kept
in
the
stables
and
to
wait
upon
all
other
persons
in
the
house
when
they
take
their
meals
to
dress
the
hair
of
the
joro
belonging
to
this
house
dressing
the
hair
of
each
in
the
style
that
best
becomes
her
and
also
to
fill
seven
boxes
with
threads
of
twisted
hemp
also
to
make
the
fire
daily
in
seven
furnaces
and
to
draw
water
from
a
spring
in
the
mountains
half
a
mile
from
here
terute
knew
that
neither
she
nor
any
other
being
alive
could
possibly
fulfill
all
the
tasks
thus
laid
upon
her
by
this
cruel
master
and
she
wept
over
her
misfortune
but
she
soon
felt
that
to
weep
could
avail
her
nothing
so
wiping
away
her
tears
she
bravely
resolved
to
try
what
she
could
do
and
then
putting
on
an
apron
and
tying
back
her
sleeves
she
set
to
work
feeding
the
horses
the
great
mercy
of
the
gods
can
not
be
understood
but
it
is
certain
that
as
she
fed
the
first
horse
all
the
others
through
divine
influence
were
fully
fed
at
the
same
time
and
the
same
wonderful
thing
happened
when
she
waited
upon
the
people
of
the
house
at
mealtime
and
when
she
dressed
the
hair
of
the
girls
and
when
she
twisted
the
threads
of
hemp
and
when
she
went
to
kindle
the
fire
in
the
furnaces
but
saddest
of
all
it
was
to
see
bearing
the
upon
her
shoulders
taking
her
way
to
the
distant
spring
to
draw
water
and
when
she
saw
the
reflection
of
her
face
in
the
water
with
which
she
filled
her
buckets
then
indeed
she
wept
very
bitterly
but
the
sudden
remembrance
of
the
cruel
chobei
filled
her
with
exceeding
fear
and
urged
her
back
in
haste
to
her
terrible
abode
but
soon
the
master
of
the
joroya
began
to
see
that
his
new
servant
was
no
common
woman
and
to
treat
her
with
a
great
show
of
kindness
a
house
of
prostitution
ix
drawing
the
cart
and
now
we
shall
tell
what
became
of
the
yugyo
shonin
of
the
temple
of
fujisawa
in
kagami
who
traveled
constantly
in
japan
to
preach
the
law
of
buddha
in
all
the
provinces
chanced
to
be
passing
over
the
moor
uwanogahara
there
he
saw
many
crows
and
kites
flitting
about
a
grave
drawing
nearer
he
wondered
much
to
see
a
nameless
thing
seemingly
without
arms
or
legs
moving
between
the
pieces
of
a
broken
tombstone
then
he
remembered
the
old
tradition
that
those
who
are
put
to
death
before
having
completed
the
number
of
years
allotted
to
them
in
this
world
reappear
or
revive
in
the
form
called
and
he
thought
that
the
shape
before
him
must
be
one
of
those
unhappy
spirits
and
the
desire
arose
in
his
kindly
heart
to
have
the
monster
taken
to
the
hot
springs
belonging
to
the
temple
of
kumano
and
thereby
enable
it
to
return
to
its
former
human
state
so
he
had
a
cart
made
for
the
and
he
placed
the
nameless
shape
in
it
and
fastened
to
its
breast
a
wooden
tablet
inscribed
with
large
characters
and
the
words
of
the
inscription
were
these
take
pity
upon
this
unfortunate
being
and
help
it
upon
its
journey
to
the
hot
springs
of
the
temple
of
kumano
those
who
draw
the
cart
even
a
little
way
by
pulling
the
rope
attached
to
it
will
be
rewarded
with
very
great
good
fortune
to
draw
the
cart
even
one
step
shall
be
equal
in
merit
to
feeding
one
thousand
priests
and
to
draw
it
two
steps
shall
be
equal
in
merit
to
feeding
ten
thousand
priests
and
to
draw
it
three
steps
shall
be
equal
in
merit
to
causing
any
dead
relation
father
mother
or
husband
to
enter
upon
the
way
of
buddhahood
thus
very
soon
travelers
who
traveled
that
way
took
pity
on
the
formless
one
some
drew
the
cart
several
miles
and
others
were
kind
enough
to
draw
it
for
many
days
together
and
so
after
much
time
the
in
its
cart
appeared
before
the
joroya
of
yorodzuya
chobei
and
kohagi
of
hitachi
seeing
it
was
greatly
moved
by
the
inscription
then
becoming
suddenly
desirous
to
draw
the
cart
if
even
for
one
day
only
and
so
to
obtain
for
her
dead
husband
the
merit
resulting
from
such
work
of
mercy
she
prayed
her
master
to
allow
her
three
days
liberty
that
she
might
draw
the
cart
and
she
asked
this
for
the
sake
of
her
parents
for
she
dared
not
speak
of
her
husband
fearing
the
master
might
become
very
angry
were
he
to
learn
the
truth
chobei
at
first
refused
declaring
in
a
harsh
voice
that
since
she
had
not
obeyed
his
former
commands
she
should
never
be
allowed
to
leave
the
house
even
for
a
single
hour
but
kohagi
said
to
him
lo
master
the
hens
go
to
their
nests
when
the
weather
becomes
cold
end
the
little
birds
hie
to
the
deep
forest
even
so
do
men
in
time
of
misfortune
flee
to
the
shelter
of
benevolence
surely
it
is
because
you
are
known
as
a
kindly
man
that
the
rested
a
while
outside
the
fence
of
this
house
now
i
shall
promise
to
give
up
even
a
life
for
my
master
and
mistress
in
case
of
need
providing
you
will
only
grant
me
three
days
freedom
now
so
at
last
the
miserly
chobei
was
persuaded
to
grant
the
prayer
and
his
wife
was
glad
to
add
even
two
days
more
to
the
time
permitted
and
kohagi
thus
freed
for
five
days
was
so
rejoiced
that
she
at
once
without
delay
commenced
her
horrible
task
after
having
with
much
hardship
passed
through
such
places
as
fuhanoseki
musa
bamba
samegaye
ono
and
she
reached
the
famed
town
of
otsu
in
the
space
of
three
days
there
she
knew
that
she
would
have
to
leave
the
cart
since
it
would
take
her
two
days
to
return
thence
to
the
province
of
mino
on
her
long
way
to
otsu
the
only
pleasing
sights
and
sounds
were
the
beautiful
lilies
growing
wild
by
the
roadside
the
voices
of
the
hibari
and
shijugara
and
all
the
birds
of
spring
that
sang
in
the
trees
and
the
songs
of
the
peasant
girls
who
were
planting
the
rice
but
such
sights
and
sounds
could
please
her
only
a
moment
for
most
of
them
caused
her
to
dream
of
other
days
and
gave
her
pain
by
making
her
recollect
the
hopeless
condition
into
which
she
had
now
fallen
hibari
a
species
of
field
lark
shijugara
a
kind
of
titmouse
though
greatly
wearied
by
the
hard
labor
she
had
undertaken
for
three
whole
days
she
would
not
go
to
an
inn
she
passed
the
last
night
beside
the
nameless
shape
which
she
would
have
to
leave
next
day
often
have
i
heard
she
thought
to
herself
that
a
is
a
being
belonging
to
the
world
of
the
dead
this
one
then
should
know
something
about
my
dead
husband
oh
that
this
had
the
sense
either
of
hearing
or
of
sight
then
i
could
question
it
about
either
by
word
of
mouth
or
in
writing
when
day
dawned
above
the
neighboring
misty
mountains
kohagi
went
away
to
get
an
inkstone
and
a
brush
and
she
soon
returned
with
these
to
the
place
where
the
cart
was
then
with
the
brush
she
wrote
below
the
inscription
upon
the
wooden
tablet
attached
to
the
breast
of
the
these
words
when
you
shall
have
recovered
and
are
able
to
return
to
your
province
pray
call
upon
kohagi
of
hitachi
a
servant
of
yorodzuya
chobei
of
the
town
of
obaka
in
the
province
of
mino
for
it
will
give
me
much
joy
to
see
the
person
for
whose
sake
i
obtained
with
difficulty
five
days
freedom
three
of
which
i
gave
to
drawing
your
cart
as
far
as
this
place
then
she
bade
the
farewell
and
turned
back
upon
her
homeward
way
although
she
found
it
very
difficult
thus
to
leave
the
cart
alone
x
the
revival
at
last
the
was
brought
to
the
hot
springs
of
the
famed
temple
of
kumano
gongen
and
by
the
aid
of
those
compassionate
persons
who
pitied
its
state
was
daily
enabled
to
experience
the
healing
effects
of
the
bath
after
a
single
week
the
effects
of
the
bath
caused
the
eyes
nose
ears
and
mouth
to
reappear
after
fourteen
days
all
the
limbs
had
been
fully
and
after
days
the
nameless
shape
was
completely
transformed
into
the
real
perfect
and
handsome
as
he
had
been
in
other
years
when
this
marvelous
change
had
been
effected
looked
all
about
him
and
wondered
much
when
and
how
he
had
been
brought
to
that
strange
place
but
through
the
august
influence
of
the
god
of
kumano
things
were
so
ordained
that
the
revived
prince
could
return
safely
to
his
home
at
nijo
in
kyoto
where
his
parents
the
lord
and
his
spouse
welcomed
him
with
great
joy
then
the
august
emperor
hearing
all
that
had
happened
thought
it
a
wonderful
thing
that
an
of
his
subjects
after
having
been
dead
three
years
should
have
thus
revived
and
not
only
did
he
gladly
pardon
the
fault
for
which
the
hangwan
had
been
banished
but
further
appointed
him
to
be
lord
ruler
of
the
three
provinces
hitachi
sagami
and
mino
xi
the
interview
one
day
left
his
residence
to
make
a
journey
of
inspection
through
the
provinces
of
which
he
had
been
appointed
ruler
and
reaching
mino
he
resolved
to
visit
kohagi
of
hitachi
and
to
utter
his
thanks
to
her
for
her
exceeding
goodness
therefore
he
lodged
at
the
house
of
yorodzuya
where
he
was
conducted
to
the
finest
of
all
the
which
was
made
beautiful
with
screens
of
gold
with
chinese
carpets
with
indian
hangings
and
with
other
precious
things
of
great
cost
when
the
lord
ordered
kohagi
of
hitachi
to
be
summoned
to
his
presence
he
was
answered
that
she
was
only
one
of
the
lowest
menials
and
too
dirty
to
appear
before
him
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
these
words
only
commanding
that
she
should
come
at
once
no
matter
how
dirty
she
might
be
therefore
much
against
her
will
kohagi
was
obliged
to
appear
before
the
lord
whom
she
at
first
beheld
through
a
screen
and
saw
that
he
so
much
like
the
hangwan
that
she
was
greatly
startled
oguri
then
asked
her
to
tell
him
her
real
name
but
kohagi
refused
saying
if
i
may
not
serve
my
lord
with
wine
except
on
condition
of
telling
my
real
name
then
i
can
only
leave
the
presence
of
my
lord
but
as
she
was
about
to
go
the
hangwan
called
to
her
nay
stop
a
little
while
i
have
a
good
reason
to
ask
your
name
because
i
am
in
truth
that
very
whom
you
so
kindly
drew
last
year
to
otsu
in
a
cart
and
with
these
words
he
produced
the
wooden
tablet
upon
which
kohagi
had
written
then
she
was
greatly
moved
and
said
i
am
very
happy
to
see
you
thus
recovered
and
now
i
shall
gladly
tell
you
all
my
history
hoping
only
that
you
my
lord
will
tell
me
something
of
that
ghostly
world
from
which
you
have
come
back
and
in
which
my
husband
alas
now
dwells
i
was
born
it
hurts
my
heart
to
speak
of
former
times
the
only
daughter
of
yokoyama
choja
who
dwelt
in
the
district
of
soba
in
the
province
of
sagami
and
my
name
was
i
remember
too
well
alas
having
been
wedded
three
years
ago
to
a
famous
person
of
rank
whose
name
was
who
used
to
live
in
the
province
of
hitachi
but
my
husband
was
poisoned
by
my
father
at
the
instigation
of
his
own
third
son
saburo
i
myself
was
condemned
by
him
to
be
drowned
in
the
sea
of
sagami
and
i
owe
my
present
existence
to
the
faithful
servants
of
my
father
onio
and
oniji
then
the
lord
hangwan
said
you
see
here
before
you
terute
your
husband
although
killed
together
with
my
followers
i
had
been
destined
to
live
in
this
world
many
years
longer
by
the
learned
priest
of
fujisawa
temple
i
was
saved
and
being
provided
with
a
cart
i
was
drawn
by
many
kind
persons
to
the
hot
springs
of
kumano
where
i
was
restored
to
my
former
health
and
shape
and
now
i
have
been
appointed
lord
ruler
of
the
three
provinces
and
can
have
all
things
that
i
desire
hearing
this
tale
terute
could
scarcely
believe
it
was
not
all
a
dream
and
she
wept
for
joy
then
she
said
ah
since
last
i
saw
you
what
hardships
have
i
not
passed
through
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
i
was
tossed
about
upon
the
sea
in
a
canoe
then
i
was
in
a
great
danger
in
the
bay
of
nawoye
and
was
saved
by
a
kind
man
called
murakami
deyu
and
after
that
i
was
sold
and
bought
times
and
the
last
time
i
was
brought
here
where
i
have
been
made
to
suffer
all
kinds
of
hardship
only
because
i
refused
to
become
a
joro
that
is
why
you
now
see
me
in
so
wretched
a
condition
very
angry
was
to
hear
of
the
cruel
conduct
of
the
inhuman
chobei
and
desired
to
kill
him
at
once
but
terute
besought
her
husband
to
spare
the
man
life
and
so
fulfilled
the
promise
she
had
long
before
made
to
chobei
that
she
would
give
even
her
own
life
if
necessary
for
her
master
and
mistress
on
condition
of
being
allowed
five
days
freedom
to
draw
the
cart
of
the
and
for
this
chobei
was
really
grateful
and
in
compensation
he
presented
the
hangwan
with
the
hundred
horses
from
his
stable
and
gave
to
terute
the
servants
belonging
to
his
house
and
then
appropriately
attired
went
away
with
the
prince
and
they
began
their
journey
to
sagami
with
hearts
full
of
joy
xii
the
vengeance
this
is
the
district
of
soba
in
the
province
of
sagami
the
native
land
of
terute
how
many
beautiful
and
how
many
sorrowful
thoughts
does
it
recall
to
their
minds
and
here
also
are
yokoyama
and
his
son
who
killed
lord
ogiri
with
poison
so
saburo
the
third
son
being
led
to
the
moor
called
was
there
punished
but
yokoyama
choja
wicked
as
he
had
been
was
not
punished
because
parents
however
bad
must
be
for
their
children
always
like
the
sun
and
moon
and
hearing
this
order
yokoyama
repented
very
greatly
for
that
which
he
had
done
qnio
and
oniji
the
brothers
were
rewarded
with
many
gifts
for
having
saved
the
princess
terute
off
the
coast
of
sagami
thus
those
who
were
good
prospered
and
the
bad
were
brought
to
destruction
fortunate
and
happy
and
together
returned
to
miako
to
dwell
in
the
residence
at
nijo
and
their
union
was
beautiful
as
the
blossoming
of
spring
fortunate
the
ballad
of
the
daughter
of
the
yaoya
in
autumn
the
deer
are
lured
within
reach
of
the
hunters
by
the
sounds
of
the
flute
which
resemble
the
sounds
of
the
voices
of
their
mates
and
so
are
killed
almost
in
like
manner
one
of
the
five
most
beautiful
girls
in
yedo
whose
comely
faces
charmed
all
the
capital
even
as
the
of
cast
away
her
life
in
the
moment
of
blindness
caused
by
love
when
having
done
a
foolish
thing
she
was
brought
before
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
yedo
that
high
official
questioned
the
young
criminal
asking
are
you
not
the
daughter
of
the
yaoya
and
being
so
young
how
came
you
to
commit
such
a
dreadful
crime
as
incendiarism
then
weeping
and
wringing
her
hands
made
this
answer
indeed
that
is
the
only
crime
i
ever
committed
and
i
had
no
extraordinary
reason
for
it
but
this
once
before
when
there
had
been
a
great
fire
so
great
a
fire
that
nearly
all
yedo
was
consumed
our
house
also
was
burned
down
and
we
three
my
parents
and
i
knowing
no
otherwhere
to
go
took
shelter
in
a
buddhist
temple
to
remain
there
until
our
house
could
be
rebuilt
surely
the
destiny
that
draws
two
young
persons
to
each
other
is
hard
to
understand
in
that
temple
there
was
a
young
acolyte
and
love
grew
up
between
us
in
secret
we
met
together
and
promised
never
to
forsake
each
other
and
we
pledged
ourselves
to
each
other
by
sucking
blood
from
small
cuts
we
made
in
our
little
fingers
and
by
exchanging
written
vows
that
we
should
love
each
other
forever
before
our
pillows
had
yet
become
fixed
our
new
house
in
hongo
was
built
and
made
ready
for
us
but
from
that
day
when
i
bade
a
sad
farewell
to
to
whom
i
had
pledged
myself
for
the
time
of
two
existences
never
was
my
heart
consoled
by
even
one
letter
from
the
acolyte
alone
in
my
bed
at
night
i
used
to
think
and
think
and
at
last
in
a
dream
there
came
to
me
the
dreadful
idea
of
setting
fire
to
the
house
as
the
only
means
of
again
being
able
to
meet
my
beautiful
lover
then
one
evening
i
got
a
bundle
of
dry
rushes
and
placed
inside
it
some
pieces
of
live
charcoal
and
i
secretly
put
the
bundle
into
a
shed
at
the
back
of
the
house
a
fire
broke
out
and
there
was
a
great
tumult
and
i
was
arrested
and
brought
here
oh
how
dreadful
it
was
i
will
never
never
commit
such
a
fault
again
but
whatever
happen
oh
pray
save
me
my
bugyo
oh
pray
take
pity
on
me
ah
the
simple
apology
but
what
was
her
age
not
twelve
not
thirteen
not
fourteen
fifteen
comes
after
fourteen
alas
she
was
fifteen
and
could
not
be
saved
therefore
was
sentenced
according
to
the
law
but
first
she
was
bound
with
strong
cords
and
was
for
seven
days
exposed
to
public
view
on
the
bridge
called
nihonbashi
ah
what
a
piteous
sight
it
was
her
aunts
and
cousins
even
bekurai
and
kakusuke
the
house
servants
had
often
to
wring
their
sleeves
so
wet
were
their
sleeves
with
tears
but
because
the
crime
could
not
be
forgiven
was
bound
to
four
posts
and
fuel
was
kindled
and
the
fire
rose
up
and
poor
in
the
midst
of
that
fire
so
the
insects
of
summer
fly
to
the
yaoya
a
seller
of
vegetables
this
curious
expression
has
its
origin
in
the
japanese
saying
that
lovers
exchange
pillows
in
the
dark
the
little
japanese
wooden
pillows
might
easily
be
exchanged
by
mistake
while
the
pillows
were
yet
not
definite
or
fixed
would
mean
therefore
while
the
two
lovers
were
still
in
the
habit
of
seeking
each
other
secretly
at
night
governor
or
local
chief
the
bugyo
of
old
days
often
acted
as
judge
