to
write
when
walter
how
comes
in
through
the
outer
office
he
is
a
rather
man
of
with
a
pleasant
almost
apologetic
voice
walter
cokeson
cokeson
morning
walter
walter
my
father
here
cokeson
always
with
a
certain
patronage
as
to
a
young
man
who
might
be
doing
better
james
has
been
here
since
eleven
walter
i
been
in
to
see
the
pictures
at
the
guildhall
cokeson
looking
at
him
as
though
this
were
exactly
what
was
to
be
expected
have
you
now
ye
es
this
lease
of
boulter
am
i
to
send
it
to
counsel
walter
what
does
my
father
say
cokeson
bothered
him
walter
well
we
ca
be
too
careful
cokeson
it
such
a
little
thing
hardly
worth
the
fees
i
thought
you
do
it
yourself
walter
send
it
please
i
do
want
the
responsibility
cokeson
with
an
indescribable
air
of
compassion
just
as
you
like
this
case
we
got
on
the
deeds
walter
i
know
but
the
intention
was
obviously
to
exclude
that
bit
of
common
ground
cokeson
we
need
worry
about
that
we
the
right
side
of
the
law
walter
i
do
like
it
cokeson
with
an
indulgent
smile
we
sha
want
to
set
ourselves
up
against
the
law
your
father
would
waste
his
time
doing
that
as
he
speaks
james
how
comes
in
from
the
partners
room
he
is
a
shortish
man
with
white
plentiful
grey
hair
shrewd
eyes
and
gold
james
morning
walter
walter
how
are
you
father
cokeson
looking
down
his
nose
at
the
papers
in
his
hand
as
though
deprecating
their
size
i
just
take
boulter
lease
in
to
young
falder
to
draft
the
instructions
he
goes
out
into
falder
room
walter
about
that
case
james
oh
well
we
must
go
forward
there
i
thought
you
told
me
yesterday
the
firm
balance
was
over
four
hundred
walter
so
it
is
james
holding
out
the
to
his
son
three
five
one
no
recent

to
a
cupboard

a
drawer
and
produces
a
james
tick

pounds
in
the
counterfoils
five
seven
five
twenty
ninety
eleven
tally
walter
nodding
ca
understand
made
sure
it

over
four
hundred
james
give
me

he

the
and
cons

counterfoils
what
this
ninety
walter
who
drew
it

you
walter
taking
the
july
that
the
day
i
went
down
to
look
over
the
trenton
estate
last
friday
week
i
came
back
on
the
tuesday
you
remember
but
look
here
father
it
was
nine
i
drew
a
cheque
for
five
guineas
to
smithers
and
my
expenses
it
just
covered
all
but
half
a
crown
james
gravely
let
look
at
that
ninety
cheque
he
sorts
the
cheque
out
from
the
bundle
in
the
pocket
of
the
seems
all
right
there
no
nine
here
this
is
bad
who
cashed
that
cheque
walter
puzzled
and
pained
let
see
i
was
finishing
reddy
will
only
just
had
time
yes
i
gave
it
to
cokeson
james
look
at
that
that
yours
walter
after
consideration
my
y
curl
back
a
little
this
does
james
as
cokeson
from
falder
room
we
must
ask
him
just
come
here
and
carry
your
mind
back
a
bit
cokeson
remember
cashing
a
cheque
for
walter
last
friday
week
the
day
he
went
to
trenton
cokeson
nine
pounds
james
look
at
this
handing
him
the
cheque
cokeson
no
nine
pounds
my
lunch
was
just
coming
in
and
of
course
i
like
it
hot
i
gave
the
cheque
to
davis
to
run
round
to
the
bank
he
brought
it
back
all
gold
you
remember
walter
you
wanted
some
silver
to
pay
your
cab
with
a
certain
contemptuous
compassion
here
let
me
see
you
got
the
wrong
cheque
he
takes
and
from
walter
walter
afraid
not
cokeson
having
seen
for
himself
it
funny
james
you
gave
it
to
davis
and
davis
sailed
for
australia
on
monday
looks
black
cokeson
cokeson
puzzled
and
upset
why
this
be
a
felony
no
no
there
some
mistake
james
i
hope
so
cokeson
there
never
been
anything
of
that
sort
in
the
office
the
years
i
been
here
james
looking
at
cheque
and
counterfoil
this
is
a
very
clever
bit
of
work
a
warning
to
you
not
to
leave
space
after
your
figures
walter
walter
vexed
yes
i
know
i
was
in
such
a
tearing
hurry
that
afternoon
cokeson
suddenly
this
has
upset
me
james
the
counterfoil
altered
too
very
deliberate
piece
of
swindling
what
was
davis
ship
walter
of
rangoon
james
we
ought
to
wire
and
have
him
arrested
at
naples
he
ca
be
there
yet
cokeson
his
poor
young
wife
i
liked
the
young
man
dear
oh
dear
in
this
office
walter
shall
i
go
to
the
bank
and
ask
the
cashier
james
grimly
bring
him
round
here
and
ring
up
scotland
yard
walter
really
he
goes
out
through
the
outer
office
james
paces
the
room
he
stops
and
looks
at
cokeson
who
is
disconsolately
rubbing
the
knees
of
his
trousers
james
well
cokeson
there
something
in
character
is
there
cokeson
looking
at
him
over
his
spectacles
i
do
quite
take
you
sir
james
your
story
would
sound
d
d
thin
to
any
one
who
know
you
cokeson
he
laughs
then
with
a
sudden
gravity
i
sorry
for
that
young
man
i
feel
it
as
if
it
was
my
own
son
james
james
a
nasty
business
cokeson
it
unsettles
you
all
goes
on
regular
and
then
a
thing
like
this
happens
sha
relish
my
lunch
james
as
bad
as
that
cokeson
cokeson
it
makes
you
think
confidentially
he
must
have
had
temptation
james
not
so
fast
we
have
convicted
him
yet
cokeson
i
sooner
have
lost
a
month
salary
than
had
this
happen
he
broods
james
i
hope
that
fellow
will
hurry
up
cokeson
keeping
things
pleasant
for
the
cashier
it
is
fifty
yards
james
he
wo
be
a
minute
james
the
idea
of
dishonesty
about
this
office
it
hits
me
hard
cokeson
he
goes
towards
the
door
of
the
partners
room
sweedle
entering
quietly
to
cokeson
in
a
low
voice
she
popped
up
again
she
forgot
to
say
to
falder
cokeson
roused
from
his
abstraction
eh
impossible
send
her
away
james
what
that
cokeson
nothing
james
a
private
matter
here
i
come
myself
he
goes
into
the
outer
office
as
james
passes
into
the
partners
room
now
you
really
must
we
ca
have
anybody
just
now
ruth
not
for
a
minute
sir
cokeson
reely
reely
i
ca
have
it
if
you
want
him
wait
about
he
be
going
out
for
his
lunch
directly
ruth
yes
sir
walter
entering
with
the
cashier
passes
ruth
as
she
leaves
the
outer
office
cokeson
to
the
cashier
who
resembles
a
sedentary
dragoon
to
walter
your
father
in
there
walter
crosses
and
goes
into
the
partners
room
cokeson
it
a
nahsty
unpleasant
little
matter
cowley
quite
ashamed
to
have
to
trouble
you
cowley
i
remember
the
cheque
quite
well
as
if
it
were
a
liver
seemed
in
perfect
order
cokeson
sit
down
wo
you
i
not
a
sensitive
man
but
a
thing
like
this
about
the
place
it
not
nice
i
like
people
to
be
open
and
jolly
together
cowley
quite
so
cokeson
buttonholing
him
and
glancing
toward
the
partners
room
of
course
he
a
young
man
i
told
him
about
it
before
now
leaving
space
after
his
figures
but
he
will
do
it
cowley
i
should
remember
the
person
face
quite
a
youth
cokeson
i
do
think
we
shall
be
able
to
show
him
to
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
james
and
walter
have
come
back
from
the
partners
room
james
cowley
you
seen
my
son
and
myself
you
seen
cokeson
and
you
seen
sweedle
my
it
was
none
of
us
i
take
it
the
cashier
shakes
his
head
with
a
smile
james
be
so
good
as
to
sit
there
cokeson
engage
cowley
in
conversation
will
you
he
goes
toward
falder
room
cokeson
just
a
word
james
james
well
cokeson
you
do
want
to
upset
the
young
man
in
there
do
you
he
a
nervous
young
feller
james
this
must
be
thoroughly
cleared
up
cokeson
for
the
sake
of
falder
name
to
say
nothing
of
yours
cokeson
with
some
dignity
that
look
after
itself
sir
been
upset
once
this
morning
i
do
want
him
startled
again
james
it
a
matter
of
form
but
i
ca
stand
upon
niceness
over
a
thing
like
this
too
serious
just
talk
to
cowley
he
opens
the
door
of
falder
room
james
bring
in
the
papers
in
boulter
lease
will
you
falder
cokeson
bursting
into
voice
do
you
keep
dogs
the
cashier
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
does
not
answer
cokeson
you
have
such
a
thing
as
a
bulldog
pup
you
could
spare
me
i
suppose
at
the
look
on
the
cashier
face
his
jaw
drops
and
he
turns
to
see
falder
standing
in
the
doorway
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
cowley
like
the
eyes
of
a
rabbit
fastened
on
a
snake
falder
advancing
with
the
papers
here
they
are
sir
james
taking
them
thank
you
falder
do
you
want
me
sir
james
no
thanks
falder
turns
and
goes
back
into
his
own
room
as
he
shuts
the
door
james
gives
the
cashier
an
interrogative
look
and
the
cashier
nods
james
sure
this
is
as
we
suspected
cowley
quite
he
knew
me
i
suppose
he
ca
slip
out
of
that
room
cokeson
gloomily
there
only
the
window
a
whole
floor
and
a
basement
the
door
of
falder
room
is
quietly
opened
and
falder
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
moves
towards
the
door
of
the
outer
office
james
quietly
where
are
you
going
falder
falder
to
have
my
lunch
sir
james
wait
a
few
minutes
would
you
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
this
lease
falder
yes
sir
he
goes
back
into
his
room
cowley
if
i
wanted
i
can
swear
that
the
young
man
who
cashed
the
cheque
it
was
the
last
cheque
i
handled
that
morning
before
my
lunch
these
are
the
numbers
of
the
notes
he
had
he
puts
a
slip
of
paper
on
the
table
then
brushing
his
hat
round
james
cowley
cowley
to
cokeson
cokeson
with
stupefaction
the
cashier
goes
out
through
the
outer
office
cokeson
sits
down
in
his
chair
as
though
it
were
the
only
place
left
in
the
morass
of
his
feelings
walter
what
are
you
going
to
do
james
have
him
in
give
me
the
cheque
and
the
counterfoil
cokeson
i
do
understand
i
thought
young
davis
james
we
shall
see
walter
one
moment
father
have
you
thought
it
out
james
call
him
in
cokeson
rising
with
difficulty
and
opening
falder
door
hoarsely
step
in
here
a
minute
falder
impassively
yes
sir
james
turning
to
him
suddenly
with
the
cheque
held
out
you
know
this
cheque
falder
falder
no
sir
jades
look
at
it
you
cashed
it
last
friday
week
falder
oh
yes
sir
that
one
davis
gave
it
me
james
i
know
and
you
gave
davis
the
cash
falder
yes
sir
james
when
davis
gave
you
the
cheque
was
it
exactly
like
this
falder
yes
i
think
so
sir
james
you
know
that
walter
drew
that
cheque
for
nine
pounds
falder
no
sir
ninety
james
nine
falder
falder
faintly
i
do
understand
sir
james
the
suggestion
of
course
is
that
the
cheque
was
altered
whether
by
you
or
davis
is
the
question
falder
i
i
cokeson
take
your
time
take
your
time
falder
regaining
his
impassivity
not
by
me
sir
james
the
cheque
was
handed
to
cokeson
by
walter
at
one
we
know
that
because
cokeson
lunch
had
just
arrived
cokeson
i
could
leave
it
james
exactly
he
therefore
gave
the
cheque
to
davis
it
was
cashed
by
you
at
we
know
that
because
the
cashier
recollects
it
for
the
last
cheque
he
handled
before
his
lunch
falder
yes
sir
davis
gave
it
to
me
because
some
friends
were
giving
him
a
farewell
luncheon
james
puzzled
you
accuse
davis
then
falder
i
do
know
sir
it
very
funny
walter
who
has
come
close
to
his
father
says
something
to
him
in
a
low
voice
james
davis
was
not
here
again
after
that
saturday
was
he
cokeson
anxious
to
be
of
assistance
to
the
young
man
and
seeing
faint
signs
of
their
all
being
jolly
once
more
no
he
sailed
on
the
monday
james
was
he
falder
falder
very
faintly
no
sir
james
very
well
then
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
this
nought
was
added
to
the
nine
in
the
counterfoil
on
or
after
tuesday
cokeson
surprised
how
that
falder
gives
a
sort
of
lurch
he
tries
to
pull
himself
together
but
he
has
gone
all
to
pieces
james
very
grimly
out
i
afraid
cokeson
the
remained
in
walter
pocket
till
he
came
back
from
trenton
on
tuesday
morning
in
the
face
of
this
falder
do
you
still
deny
that
you
altered
both
cheque
and
counterfoil
falder
no
sir
no
how
i
did
it
sir
i
did
it
cokeson
succumbing
to
his
feelings
dear
dear
what
a
thing
to
do
falder
i
wanted
the
money
so
badly
sir
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
cokeson
however
such
a
thing
could
have
come
into
your
head
falder
grasping
at
the
words
i
ca
think
sir
really
it
was
just
a
minute
of
madness
james
a
long
minute
falder
tapping
the
counterfoil
four
days
at
least
falder
sir
i
swear
i
did
know
what
i
done
till
afterwards
and
then
i
had
the
pluck
oh
sir
look
over
it
i
pay
the
money
back
i
will
i
promise
james
go
into
your
room
falder
with
a
swift
imploring
look
goes
back
into
his
room
there
is
silence
james
about
as
bad
a
case
as
there
could
be
cokeson
to
break
the
law
like
here
walter
what
to
be
done
james
nothing
for
it
prosecute
walter
it
his
first
offence
james
shaking
his
head
i
grave
doubts
of
that
too
neat
a
piece
of
swindling
altogether
cokeson
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
was
tempted
james
life
one
long
temptation
cokeson
cokeson
but
i
speaking
of
the
flesh
and
the
devil
james
there
was
a
woman
come
to
see
him
this
morning
walter
the
woman
we
passed
as
we
came
in
just
now
is
it
his
wife
cokeson
no
no
relation
restraining
what
in
jollier
circumstances
would
have
been
a
wink
a
married
person
though
walter
how
do
you
know
cokeson
brought
her
children
scandalised
there
they
were
outside
the
office
james
a
real
bad
egg
walter
i
should
like
to
give
him
a
chance
james
i
ca
forgive
him
for
the
sneaky
way
he
went
to
work
counting
on
our
suspecting
young
davis
if
the
matter
came
to
light
it
was
the
merest
accident
the
stayed
in
your
pocket
walter
it
must
have
been
the
temptation
of
a
moment
he
time
james
a
man
does
succumb
like
that
in
a
moment
if
he
a
clean
mind
and
habits
he
rotten
got
the
eyes
of
a
man
who
ca
keep
his
hands
off
when
there
money
about
walter
dryly
we
had
noticed
that
before
james
brushing
the
remark
aside
i
seen
lots
of
those
fellows
in
my
time
no
doing
anything
with
them
except
to
keep
out
of
harm
way
they
got
a
blind
spat
walter
it
penal
servitude
cokeson
they
nahsty
james
hesitating
i
do
see
how
it
possible
to
spare
him
out
of
the
question
to
keep
him
in
this
office
honesty
the
qua
non
cokeson
hypnotised
of
course
it
is
james
equally
out
of
the
question
to
send
him
out
amongst
people
who
no
knowledge
of
his
character
one
must
think
of
society
walter
but
to
brand
him
like
this
james
if
it
had
been
a
straightforward
case
i
give
him
another
chance
it
far
from
that
he
has
dissolute
habits
cokeson
i
did
say
that
extenuating
circumstances
james
same
thing
he
gone
to
work
in
the
most
way
to
defraud
his
employers
and
cast
the
blame
on
an
innocent
man
if
that
not
a
case
for
the
law
to
take
its
course
i
do
know
what
is
walter
for
the
sake
of
his
future
though
james
sarcastically
according
to
you
no
one
would
ever
prosecute
walter
nettled
i
hate
the
idea
of
it
cokeson
that
rather
parte
walter
we
must
have
protection
james
this
is
degenerating
into
talk
he
moves
towards
the
partners
room
walter
put
yourself
in
his
place
father
james
you
ask
too
much
of
me
walter
we
ca
possibly
tell
the
pressure
there
was
on
him
james
you
may
depend
on
it
my
boy
if
a
man
is
going
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
he
do
it
pressure
or
no
pressure
if
he
nothing
make
him
walter
he
never
do
it
again
cokeson
fatuously
i
were
to
have
a
talk
with
him
we
do
want
to
be
hard
on
the
young
man
james
that
do
cokeson
i
made
up
my
mind
he
passes
into
the
partners
room
cokeson
after
a
doubtful
moment
we
must
excuse
your
father
i
do
want
to
go
against
your
father
if
he
thinks
it
right
walter
confound
it
cokeson
why
do
you
back
me
up
you
know
you
feel
cokeson
on
his
dignity
i
really
ca
say
what
i
feel
walter
we
shall
regret
it
cokeson
he
must
have
known
what
he
was
doing
walter
bitterly
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
strained
cokeson
looking
at
him
askance
come
come
walter
we
must
try
and
see
it
sensible
sweedle
entering
with
a
tray
your
lunch
sir
cokeson
put
it
down
while
sweedle
is
putting
it
down
on
cokeson
table
the
detective
wister
enters
the
outer
office
and
finding
no
one
there
comes
to
the
inner
doorway
he
is
a
square
man
in
a
serviceable
blue
serge
suit
and
strong
boots
cokeson
hoarsely
here
here
what
are
we
doing
wister
to
walter
from
scotland
yard
sir
blister
walter
askance
very
well
i
speak
to
my
father
he
goes
into
the
partners
room
james
enters
james
morning
in
answer
to
an
appealing
gesture
from
cokeson
i
sorry
i
stop
short
of
this
if
i
felt
i
could
open
that
door
sweedle
wondering
and
scared
opens
it
come
here
falder
as
falder
comes
shrinkingly
out
the
detective
in
obedience
to
a
sign
from
james
slips
his
hand
out
and
grasps
his
arm
falder
recoiling
oh
no
oh
no
walter
come
come
there
a
good
lad
james
i
charge
him
with
felony
falter
oh
sir
there
some
one
i
did
it
for
her
let
me
be
till
james
motions
with
his
hand
at
that
sign
of
hardness
falder
becomes
rigid
then
turning
he
goes
out
quietly
in
the
detective
grip
james
follows
stiff
and
erect
sweedle
rushing
to
the
door
with
open
mouth
pursues
them
through
the
outer
office
into
the
corridor
when
they
have
all
disappeared
cokeson
spins
completely
round
and
makes
a
rush
for
the
outer
office
cokeson
hoarsely
here
what
are
we
doing
there
is
silence
he
takes
out
his
handkerchief
and
mops
the
sweat
from
his
face
going
back
blindly
to
his
table
sits
down
and
stares
blankly
at
his
lunch
the
curtain
falls
act
ii
a
court
of
justice
on
a
foggy
october
afternoon
crowded
with
barristers
solicitors
reporters
ushers
and
jurymen
sitting
in
the
large
solid
dock
is
falder
with
a
warder
on
either
side
of
him
placed
there
for
his
safe
custody
but
seemingly
indifferent
to
and
unconscious
of
his
presence
falder
is
sitting
exactly
opposite
to
the
judge
who
raised
above
the
clamour
of
the
court
also
seems
unconscious
of
and
indifferent
to
everything
harold
cleaver
the
counsel
for
the
crown
is
a
dried
yellowish
man
of
more
than
middle
age
in
a
wig
worn
almost
to
the
colour
of
his
face
hector
frome
the
counsel
for
the
defence
is
a
young
tall
man
clean
shaved
in
a
very
white
wig
among
the
spectators
having
already
given
their
evidence
are
james
and
walter
how
and
cowley
the
cashier
wister
the
detective
is
just
leaving
the
cleaver
that
is
the
case
for
the
crown
me
lud
gathering
his
robes
together
he
sits
down
frome
rising
and
bowing
to
the
judge
if
it
please
your
lordship
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
am
not
going
to
dispute
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
altered
this
cheque
but
i
am
going
to
put
before
you
evidence
as
to
the
condition
of
his
mind
and
to
submit
that
you
would
not
be
justified
in
finding
that
he
was
responsible
for
his
actions
at
the
time
i
am
going
to
show
you
in
fact
that
he
did
this
in
a
moment
of
aberration
amounting
to
temporary
insanity
caused
by
the
violent
distress
under
which
he
was
labouring
gentlemen
the
prisoner
is
only
years
old
i
shall
call
before
you
a
woman
from
whom
you
will
learn
the
events
that
led
up
to
this
act
you
will
hear
from
her
own
lips
the
tragic
circumstances
of
her
life
the
still
more
tragic
infatuation
with
which
she
has
inspired
the
prisoner
this
woman
gentlemen
has
been
leading
a
miserable
existence
with
a
husband
who
habitually
her
from
whom
she
actually
goes
in
terror
of
her
life
i
am
not
of
course
saying
that
it
either
right
or
desirable
for
a
young
man
to
fall
in
love
with
a
married
woman
or
that
it
his
business
to
rescue
her
from
an
husband
i
not
saying
anything
of
the
sort
but
we
all
know
the
power
of
the
passion
of
love
and
i
would
ask
you
to
remember
gentlemen
in
listening
to
her
evidence
that
married
to
a
drunken
and
violent
husband
she
has
no
power
to
get
rid
of
him
for
as
you
know
another
offence
besides
violence
is
necessary
to
enable
a
woman
to
obtain
a
divorce
and
of
this
offence
it
does
not
appear
that
her
husband
is
guilty
judge
is
this
relevant
frome
frome
my
lord
i
submit
extremely
i
shall
be
able
to
show
your
lordship
that
directly
judge
very
well
frome
in
these
circumstances
what
alternatives
were
left
to
her
she
could
either
go
on
living
with
this
drunkard
in
terror
of
her
life
or
she
could
apply
to
the
court
for
a
separation
order
well
gentlemen
my
experience
of
such
cases
assures
me
that
this
would
have
given
her
very
insufficient
protection
from
the
violence
of
such
a
man
and
even
if
effectual
would
very
likely
have
reduced
her
either
to
the
workhouse
or
the
streets
for
it
not
easy
as
she
is
now
finding
for
an
unskilled
woman
without
means
of
livelihood
to
support
herself
and
her
children
without
resorting
either
to
the
poor
law
or
to
speak
quite
plainly
to
the
sale
of
her
body
judge
you
are
ranging
rather
far
frome
frome
i
shall
fire
in
a
minute
my
lord
judge
let
us
hope
so
frome
now
gentlemen
mark
and
this
is
what
i
have
been
leading
up
to
this
woman
will
tell
you
and
the
prisoner
will
confirm
her
that
confronted
with
such
alternatives
she
set
her
whole
hopes
on
himself
knowing
the
feeling
with
which
she
had
inspired
him
she
saw
a
way
out
of
her
misery
by
going
with
him
to
a
new
country
where
they
would
both
be
unknown
and
might
pass
as
husband
and
wife
this
was
a
desperate
and
as
my
friend
cleaver
will
no
doubt
call
it
an
immoral
resolution
but
as
a
fact
the
minds
of
both
of
them
were
constantly
turned
towards
it
one
wrong
is
no
excuse
for
another
and
those
who
are
never
likely
to
be
faced
by
such
a
situation
possibly
have
the
right
to
hold
up
their
hands
as
to
that
i
prefer
to
say
nothing
but
whatever
view
you
take
gentlemen
of
this
part
of
the
prisoner
story
whatever
opinion
you
form
of
the
right
of
these
two
young
people
under
such
circumstances
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
the
fact
remains
that
this
young
woman
in
her
distress
and
this
young
man
little
more
than
a
boy
who
was
so
devotedly
attached
to
her
did
conceive
this
if
you
like
reprehensible
design
of
going
away
together
now
for
that
of
course
they
required
money
and
they
had
none
as
to
the
actual
events
of
the
morning
of
july
on
which
this
cheque
was
altered
the
events
on
which
i
rely
to
prove
the
defendant
irresponsibility
i
shall
allow
those
events
to
speak
for
themselves
through
the
lips
of
my
witness
robert
cokeson
he
turns
looks
round
takes
up
a
sheet
of
paper
and
waits
cokeson
is
summoned
into
court
and
goes
into
the
holding
his
hat
before
him
the
oath
is
administered
to
him
frome
what
is
your
name
cokeson
robert
cokeson
frome
are
you
managing
clerk
to
the
firm
of
solicitors
who
employ
the
prisoner
cokeson
frome
how
long
had
the
prisoner
been
in
their
employ
cokeson
two
years
no
i
wrong
there
all
but
seventeen
days
frome
had
you
him
under
your
eye
all
that
time
cokeson
except
sundays
and
holidays
frome
quite
so
let
us
hear
please
what
you
have
to
say
about
his
general
character
during
those
two
years
cokeson
confidentially
to
the
jury
and
as
if
a
little
surprised
at
being
asked
he
was
a
nice
young
man
i
no
fault
to
find
with
him
quite
the
contrary
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
me
when
he
did
a
thing
like
that
frome
did
he
ever
give
you
reason
to
suspect
his
honesty
cokeson
no
to
have
dishonesty
in
our
office
that
never
do
frome
i
sure
the
jury
fully
appreciate
that
cokeson
cokeson
every
man
of
business
knows
that
honesty
sign
qua
non
frome
do
you
give
him
a
good
character
all
round
or
do
you
not
cokeson
turning
to
the
judge
certainly
we
were
all
very
jolly
and
pleasant
together
until
this
happened
quite
upset
me
frome
now
coming
to
the
morning
of
the
of
july
the
morning
on
which
the
cheque
was
altered
what
have
you
to
say
about
his
demeanour
that
morning
cokeson
to
the
jury
if
you
ask
me
i
do
think
he
was
quite
compos
when
he
did
it
the
judge
sharply
are
you
suggesting
that
he
was
insane
cokeson
not
compos
the
judge
a
little
more
precision
please
frome
smoothly
just
tell
us
cokeson
cokeson
somewhat
outraged
well
in
my
opinion
looking
at
the
judge
such
as
it
is
he
was
jumpy
at
the
time
the
jury
will
understand
my
meaning
frome
will
you
tell
us
how
you
came
to
that
conclusion
cokeson
i
will
i
have
my
lunch
in
from
the
restaurant
a
chop
and
a
potato
saves
time
that
day
it
happened
to
come
just
as
walter
how
handed
me
the
cheque
well
i
like
it
hot
so
i
went
into
the
clerks
office
and
i
handed
the
cheque
to
davis
the
other
clerk
and
told
him
to
get
change
i
noticed
young
falder
walking
up
and
down
i
said
to
him
this
is
not
the
zoological
gardens
falder
frome
do
you
remember
what
he
answered
cokeson
i
wish
to
god
it
were
struck
me
as
funny
frome
did
you
notice
anything
else
peculiar
cokeson
i
did
frome
what
was
that
cokeson
his
collar
was
unbuttoned
now
i
like
a
young
man
to
be
neat
i
said
to
him
your
collar
unbuttoned
frome
and
what
did
he
answer
cokeson
stared
at
me
it
was
nice
the
judge
stared
at
you
is
that
a
very
common
practice
cokeson
but
it
was
the
look
in
his
eyes
i
ca
explain
my
meaning
it
was
funny
frome
had
you
ever
seen
such
a
look
in
his
eyes
before
cokeson
no
if
i
had
i
should
have
spoken
to
the
partners
we
ca
have
anything
eccentric
in
our
profession
the
judge
did
you
speak
to
them
on
that
occasion
cokeson
confidentially
well
i
did
like
to
trouble
them
about
prime
facey
evidence
frome
but
it
made
a
very
distinct
impression
on
your
mind
cokeson
the
clerk
davis
could
have
told
you
the
same
frome
quite
so
it
very
unfortunate
that
we
not
got
him
here
now
can
you
tell
me
of
the
morning
on
which
the
discovery
of
the
forgery
was
made
that
would
be
the
did
anything
happen
that
morning
cokeson
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
i
a
little
deaf
frome
was
there
anything
in
the
course
of
that
morning
i
mean
before
the
discovery
that
caught
your
attention
cokeson
a
woman
the
judge
how
is
this
relevant
frome
frome
i
am
trying
to
establish
the
state
of
mind
in
which
the
prisoner
committed
this
act
my
lord
the
judge
i
quite
appreciate
that
but
this
was
long
after
the
act
frome
yes
my
lord
but
it
contributes
to
my
contention
the
judge
well
frome
you
say
a
woman
do
you
mean
that
she
came
to
the
office
cokeson
frome
what
for
cokeson
asked
to
see
young
falder
he
was
out
at
the
moment
frome
did
you
see
her
cokeson
i
did
frome
did
she
come
alone
cokeson
confidentially
well
there
you
put
me
in
a
difficulty
i
must
tell
you
what
the
told
me
frome
quite
so
cokeson
quite
so
cokeson
breaking
in
with
an
air
of
you
are
young
leave
it
to
me
but
i
think
we
can
get
round
it
in
answer
to
a
question
put
to
her
by
a
third
party
the
woman
said
to
me
they
mine
sir
the
judge
what
are
what
were
cokeson
her
children
they
were
outside
the
judge
how
do
you
know
cokeson
your
lordship
must
ask
me
that
or
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
what
i
was
told
and
that
never
do
the
judge
smiling
the
made
a
statement
cokeson
frome
what
i
want
to
ask
you
cokeson
is
this
in
the
course
of
her
appeal
to
see
falder
did
the
woman
say
anything
that
you
specially
remember
cokeson
looking
at
him
as
if
to
encourage
him
to
complete
the
sentence
a
leetle
more
sir
frome
or
did
she
not
cokeson
she
did
i
should
like
you
to
have
led
me
to
the
answer
frome
with
an
irritated
smile
will
you
tell
the
jury
what
it
was
cokeson
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
foreman
of
the
jury
do
you
mean
the
woman
said
that
cokeson
nodding
it
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
like
to
have
said
to
you
frome
a
little
impatiently
did
falder
come
in
while
she
was
there
cokeson
nods
and
she
saw
him
and
went
away
cokeson
ah
there
i
ca
follow
you
i
did
see
her
go
frome
well
is
she
there
now
cokeson
with
an
indulgent
smile
no
frome
thank
you
cokeson
he
sits
down
cleaver
rising

say
that
on
the
morning
of
the
forgery

precisely
do
you
mean
by
that
word
cokeson
indulgently
i
want
you
to
understand
have
you
ever
seen
a
dog
that
lost
its
master

that
strange
or

cokeson
funny
cokeson
sharply

what
may
be
funny
to
you

funny
to
me
or

shy
or
fierce
or
what
cokeson

it
very
hard
for
me

give
you
the

his
collar
unbuttoned

did
he
button
it
when

say
that
that
denoted
insanity

sits
downs

has
opened
his
mouth
to

was
always
clean
and
quiet
frome
that
will
do
thank
you
cokeson
turns
blandly
to
the
judge
as
though
to
rebuke
counsel
for
not
remembering
that
the
judge
might
wish
to
have
a
chance
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
he
is
to
be
asked

know
frome
yes
falder
when
she
left
me
because
i
had
to
go
to
the
office
i
was
out
of
my
senses
for
fear
that
he
do
it
again
and
thinking
what
i
could
do
i
could
work
all
the
morning
i
was
like
that
simply
could
fix
my
mind
on
anything
i
could
think
at
all
i
seemed
to
have
to
keep
moving
when
davis
the
other
clerk
gave
me
the
cheque
he
said
it
do
you
good
will
to
have
a
run
with
this
you
seem
half
off
your
chump
this
morning
then
when
i
had
it
in
my
hand
i
do
know
how
it
came
but
it
just
flashed
across
me
that
if
i
put
the
and
the
nought
there
would
be
the
money
to
get
her
away
it
just
came
and
went
i
never
thought
of
it
again
then
davis
went
out
to
his
luncheon
and
i
do
really
remember
what
i
did
till
i
pushed
the
cheque
through
to
the
cashier
under
the
rail
i
remember
his
saying
gold
or
notes
then
i
suppose
i
knew
what
i
done
anyway
when
i
got
outside
i
wanted
to
chuck
myself
under
a
bus
i
wanted
to
throw
the
money
away
but
it
seemed
i
was
in
for
it
so
i
thought
at
any
rate
i
save
her
of
course
the
tickets
i
took
for
the
passage
and
the
little
i
gave
her
been
wasted
and
all
except
what
i
was
obliged
to
spend
myself
i
restored
i
keep
thinking
over
and
over
however
it
was
i
came
to
do
it
and
how
i
ca
have
it
all
again
to
do
differently
falder
is
silent
twisting
his
hands
before
him
frome
how
far
is
it
from
your
office
to
the
bank
falder
not
more
than
fifty
yards
sir
frome
from
the
time
davis
went
out
to
lunch
to
the
time
you
cashed
the
cheque
how
long
do
you
say
it
must
have
been
falder
it
could
have
been
four
minutes
sir
because
i
ran
all
the
way
frome
during
those
four
minutes
you
say
you
remember
nothing
falder
no
sir
only
that
i
ran
frome
not
even
adding
the
and
the
nought
falder
no
sir
i
do
really
frome
sits
down
and
cleaver
rises
cleaver
but
you
remember
running
do
you
falder
i
was
all
out
of
breath
when
i
got
to
the
bank
cleaver
and
you
do
remember
altering
the
cheque
falder
faintly
no
sir
cleaver
divested
of
the
romantic
glamour
which
my
friend
is
casting
over
the
case
is
this
anything
but
an
ordinary
forgery
come
falder
i
was
half
frantic
all
that
morning
sir
cleaver
now
now
you
do
deny
that
the
and
the
nought
were
so
like
the
rest
of
the
handwriting
as
to
thoroughly
deceive
the
cashier
falder
it
was
an
accident
cleaver
cheerfully
queer
sort
of
accident
was
it
on
which
day
did
you
alter
the
counterfoil
falder
hanging
his
head
on
the
wednesday
morning
cleaver
was
that
an
accident
too
falder
faintly
no
cleaver
to
do
that
you
had
to
watch
your
opportunity
i
suppose
falder
almost
inaudibly
yes
cleaver
you
do
suggest
that
you
were
suffering
under
great
excitement
when
you
did
that
falder
i
was
haunted
cleaver
with
the
fear
of
being
found
out
falder
very
low
yes
the
judge
did
it
occur
to
you
that
the
only
thing
for
you
to
do
was
to
confess
to
your
employers
and
restore
the
money
falder
i
was
afraid
there
is
silence
cleaver
you
desired
too
no
doubt
to
complete
your
design
of
taking
this
woman
away
falder
when
i
found
i
done
a
thing
like
that
to
do
it
for
nothing
seemed
so
dreadful
i
might
just
as
well
have
chucked
myself
into
the
river
cleaver
you
knew
that
the
clerk
davis
was
about
to
leave
england
did
it
occur
to
you
when
you
altered
this
cheque
that
suspicion
would
fall
on
him
falder
it
was
all
done
in
a
moment
i
thought
of
it
afterwards
cleaver
and
that
did
lead
you
to
avow
what
you
done
falder
sullenly
i
meant
to
write
when
i
got
out
there
i
would
have
repaid
the
money
the
judge
but
in
the
meantime
your
innocent
fellow
clerk
might
have
been
prosecuted
falder
i
knew
he
was
a
long
way
off
your
lordship
i
thought
there
be
time
i
did
think
they
find
it
out
so
soon
frome
i
might
remind
your
lordship
that
as
walter
how
had
the
in
his
pocket
till
after
davis
had
sailed
if
the
discovery
had
been
made
only
one
day
later
falder
himself
would
have
left
and
suspicion
would
have
attached
to
him
and
not
to
davis
from
the
beginning
the
judge
the
question
is
whether
the
prisoner
knew
that
suspicion
would
light
on
himself
and
not
on
davis
to
falder
sharply
did
you
know
that
walter
how
had
the
till
after
davis
had
sailed
falder
i
i
thought
he
the
judge
now
speak
the
or
no
falder
very
low
no
my
lord
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
the
judge
that
disposes
of
your
point
frome
frome
bows
to
the
judge
cleaver
has
any
aberration
of
this
nature
ever
attacked
you
before
falder
faintly
no
sir
cleaver
you
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
go
back
to
your
work
that
afternoon
falder
yes
i
had
to
take
the
money
back
cleaver
you
mean
the
nine
pounds
your
wits
were
sufficiently
keen
for
you
to
remember
that
and
you
still
persist
in
saying
you
remember
altering
this
cheque
he
sits
down
falder
if
i
had
been
mad
i
should
never
have
had
the
courage
frome
rising
did
you
have
your
lunch
before
going
back
falder
i
never
ate
a
thing
all
day
and
at
night
i
could
sleep
frome
now
as
to
the
four
minutes
that
elapsed
between
going
out
and
your
cashing
the
cheque
do
you
say
that
you
recollect
nothing
during
those
four
minutes
falder
after
a
moment
i
remember
thinking
of
cokeson
face
frome
of
cokeson
face
had
that
any
connection
with
what
you
were
doing
falder
no
sir
frome
was
that
in
the
office
before
you
ran
out
falder
yes
and
while
i
was
running
frome
and
that
lasted
till
the
cashier
said
will
you
have
gold
or
notes
falder
yes
and
then
i
seemed
to
come
to
myself
and
it
was
too
late
frome
thank
you
that
closes
the
evidence
for
the
defence
my
lord
the
judge
nods
and
falder
goes
back
to
his
seat
in
the
dock
frome
gathering
up
notes
if
it
please
your
lordship
gentlemen
of
the
jury
my
friend
in
has
shown
a
disposition
to
sneer
at
the
defence
which
has
been
set
up
in
this
case
and
i
am
free
to
admit
that
nothing
i
can
say
will
move
you
if
the
evidence
has
not
already
convinced
you
that
the
prisoner
committed
this
act
in
a
moment
when
to
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
he
was
not
responsible
for
his
actions
a
moment
of
such
mental
and
moral
vacuity
arising
from
the
violent
emotional
agitation
under
which
he
had
been
suffering
as
to
amount
to
temporary
madness
my
friend
has
alluded
to
the
romantic
glamour
with
which
i
have
sought
to
invest
this
case
gentlemen
i
have
done
nothing
of
the
kind
i
have
merely
shown
you
the
background
of
life
that
palpitating
life
which
believe
me
whatever
my
friend
may
say
always
lies
behind
the
commission
of
a
crime
now
gentlemen
we
live
in
a
highly
civilized
age
and
the
sight
of
brutal
violence
disturbs
us
in
a
very
strange
way
even
when
we
have
no
personal
interest
in
the
matter
but
when
we
see
it
inflicted
on
a
woman
whom
we
love
what
then
just
think
of
what
your
own
feelings
would
have
been
each
of
you
at
the
prisoner
age
and
then
look
at
him
well
he
is
hardly
the
comfortable
shall
we
say
bucolic
person
likely
to
contemplate
with
equanimity
marks
of
gross
violence
on
a
woman
to
whom
he
was
devotedly
attached
yes
gentlemen
look
at
him
he
has
not
a
strong
face
but
neither
has
he
a
vicious
face
he
is
just
the
sort
of
man
who
would
easily
become
the
prey
of
his
emotions
you
have
heard
the
description
of
his
eyes
my
friend
may
laugh
at
the
word
funny
i
think
it
better
describes
the
peculiar
uncanny
look
of
those
who
are
strained
to
than
any
other
word
which
could
have
been
used
i
do
pretend
mind
you
that
his
mental
irresponsibility
was
more
than
a
flash
of
darkness
in
which
all
sense
of
proportion
became
lost
but
to
contend
that
just
as
a
man
who
destroys
himself
at
such
a
moment
may
be
and
often
is
absolved
from
the
stigma
attaching
to
the
crime
of
so
he
may
and
frequently
does
commit
other
crimes
while
in
this
irresponsible
condition
and
that
he
may
as
justly
be
acquitted
of
criminal
intent
and
treated
as
a
patient
i
admit
that
this
is
a
plea
which
might
well
be
abused
it
is
a
matter
for
discretion
but
here
you
have
a
case
in
which
there
is
every
reason
to
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
you
heard
me
ask
the
prisoner
what
he
thought
of
during
those
four
fatal
minutes
what
was
his
answer
i
thought
of
face
gentlemen
no
man
could
invent
an
answer
like
that
it
is
absolutely
stamped
with
truth
you
have
seen
the
great
affection
legitimate
or
not
existing
between
him
and
this
woman
who
came
here
to
give
evidence
for
him
at
the
risk
of
her
life
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
doubt
his
distress
on
the
morning
when
he
committed
this
act
we
well
know
what
terrible
havoc
such
distress
can
make
in
weak
and
highly
nervous
people
it
was
all
the
work
of
a
moment
the
rest
has
followed
as
death
follows
a
stab
to
the
heart
or
water
drops
if
you
hold
up
a
jug
to
empty
it
believe
me
gentlemen
there
is
nothing
more
tragic
in
life
than
the
utter
impossibility
of
changing
what
you
have
done
once
this
cheque
was
altered
and
presented
the
work
of
four
minutes
four
mad
minutes
the
rest
has
been
silence
but
in
those
four
minutes
the
boy
before
you
has
slipped
through
a
door
hardly
opened
into
that
great
cage
which
never
again
quite
lets
a
man
go
the
cage
of
the
law
his
further
acts
his
failure
to
confess
the
alteration
of
the
counterfoil
his
preparations
for
flight
are
all
evidence
not
of
deliberate
and
guilty
intention
when
he
committed
the
prime
act
from
which
these
subsequent
acts
arose
no
they
are
merely
evidence
of
the
weak
character
which
is
clearly
enough
his
misfortune
but
is
a
man
to
be
lost
because
he
is
bred
and
born
with
a
weak
character
gentlemen
men
like
the
prisoner
are
destroyed
daily
under
our
law
for
want
of
that
human
insight
which
sees
them
as
they
are
patients
and
not
criminals
if
the
prisoner
be
found
guilty
and
treated
as
though
he
were
a
criminal
type
he
will
as
all
experience
shows
in
all
probability
become
one
i
beg
you
not
to
return
a
verdict
that
may
thrust
him
back
into
prison
and
brand
him
for
ever
gentlemen
justice
is
a
machine
that
when
some
one
has
once
given
it
the
starting
push
rolls
on
of
itself
is
this
young
man
to
be
ground
to
pieces
under
this
machine
for
an
act
which
at
the
worst
was
one
of
weakness
is
he
to
become
a
member
of
the
luckless
crews
that
man
those
dark
ships
called
prisons
is
that
to
be
his
which
so
few
return
or
is
he
to
have
another
chance
to
be
still
looked
on
as
one
who
has
gone
a
little
astray
but
who
will
come
back
i
urge
you
gentlemen
do
not
ruin
this
young
man
for
as
a
result
of
those
four
minutes
ruin
utter
and
irretrievable
stares
him
in
the
face
he
can
be
saved
now
imprison
him
as
a
criminal
and
i
affirm
to
you
that
he
will
be
lost
he
has
neither
the
face
nor
the
manner
of
one
who
can
survive
that
terrible
ordeal
weigh
in
the
scales
his
criminality
and
the
suffering
he
has
undergone
the
latter
is
ten
times
heavier
already
he
has
lain
in
prison
under
this
charge
for
more
than
two
months
is
he
likely
ever
to
forget
that
imagine
the
anguish
of
his
mind
during
that
time
he
has
had
his
punishment
gentlemen
you
may
depend
the
rolling
of
the
of
justice
over
this
boy
began
when
it
was
decided
to
prosecute
him
we
are
now
already
at
the
second
stage
if
you
permit
it
to
go
on
to
the
third
i
would
not
give
that
for
him
he
holds
up
finger
and
thumb
in
the
form
of
a
circle
drops
his
hand
and
sits
dozen
the
jury
stir
and
consult
each
other
faces
then
they
turn
towards
the
counsel
for
the
crown
who
rises
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
a
spot
that
seems
to
give
him
satisfaction
slides
them
every
now
and
then
towards
the
jury
cleaver
may
it
please
your
lordship
rising
on
his
toes
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
disputed
and
the
defence
if
my
friend
will
allow
me
to
say
so
is
so
thin
that
i
do
propose
to
waste
the
time
of
the
court
by
taking
you
over
the
evidence
the
plea
is
one
of
temporary
insanity
well
gentlemen
i
daresay
it
is
clearer
to
me
than
it
is
to
you
why
this
rather
what
shall
we
call
it
bizarre
defence
has
been
set
up
the
alternative
would
have
been
to
plead
guilty
now
gentlemen
if
the
prisoner
had
pleaded
guilty
my
friend
would
have
had
to
rely
on
a
simple
appeal
to
his
lordship
instead
of
that
he
has
gone
into
the
byways
and
hedges
and
found
this
er
peculiar
plea
which
has
enabled
him
to
show
you
the
proverbial
woman
to
put
her
in
the
box
to
give
in
fact
a
romantic
glow
to
this
affair
i
compliment
my
friend
i
think
it
highly
ingenious
of
him
by
these
means
he
has
to
a
certain
extent
got
round
the
law
he
has
brought
the
whole
story
of
motive
and
stress
out
in
court
at
first
hand
in
a
way
that
he
would
not
otherwise
have
been
able
to
do
but
when
you
have
once
grasped
that
fact
gentlemen
you
have
grasped
everything
with
contempt
for
look
at
this
plea
of
insanity
we
put
it
lower
than
that
you
have
heard
the
woman
she
has
every
reason
to
favour
the
prisoner
but
what
did
she
say
she
said
that
the
prisoner
was
not
insane
when
she
left
him
in
the
morning
if
he
were
going
out
of
his
mind
through
distress
that
was
obviously
the
moment
when
insanity
would
have
shown
itself
you
have
heard
the
managing
clerk
another
witness
for
the
defence
with
some
difficulty
i
elicited
from
him
the
admission
that
the
prisoner
though
jumpy
a
word
that
he
seemed
to
think
you
would
understand
gentlemen
and
i
sure
i
hope
you
do
was
not
mad
when
the
cheque
was
handed
to
davis
i
agree
with
my
friend
that
it
unfortunate
that
we
have
not
got
davis
here
but
the
prisoner
has
told
you
the
words
with
which
davis
in
turn
handed
him
the
cheque
he
obviously
therefore
was
not
mad
when
he
received
it
or
he
would
not
have
remembered
those
words
the
cashier
has
told
you
that
he
was
certainly
in
his
senses
when
he
cashed
it
we
have
therefore
the
plea
that
a
man
who
is
sane
at
ten
minutes
past
one
and
sane
at
fifteen
minutes
past
may
for
the
purposes
of
avoiding
the
consequences
of
a
crime
call
himself
insane
between
those
points
of
time
really
gentlemen
this
is
so
peculiar
a
proposition
that
i
am
not
disposed
to
weary
you
with
further
argument
you
will
form
your
own
opinion
of
its
value
my
friend
has
adopted
this
way
of
saying
a
great
deal
to
you
and
very
eloquently
on
the
score
of
youth
temptation
and
the
like
i
might
point
out
however
that
the
offence
with
which
the
prisoner
is
charged
is
one
of
the
most
serious
known
to
our
law
and
there
are
certain
features
in
this
case
such
as
the
suspicion
which
he
allowed
to
rest
on
his
innocent
and
his
relations
with
this
married
woman
which
will
render
it
difficult
for
you
to
attach
too
much
importance
to
such
pleading
i
ask
you
in
short
gentlemen
for
that
verdict
of
guilty
which
in
the
circumstances
i
regard
you
as
unfortunately
bound
to
record
letting
his
eyes
travel
from
the
judge
and
the
jury
to
frome
he
sits
down
the
judge
bending
a
little
towards
the
jury
and
speaking
in
a
voice
gentlemen
you
have
heard
the
evidence
and
the
comments
on
it
my
only
business
is
to
make
clear
to
you
the
issues
you
have
to
try
the
facts
are
admitted
so
far
as
the
alteration
of
this
cheque
and
counterfoil
by
the
prisoner
the
defence
set
up
is
that
he
was
not
in
a
responsible
condition
when
he
committed
the
crime
well
you
have
heard
the
prisoner
story
and
the
evidence
of
the
other
witnesses
so
far
as
it
bears
on
the
point
of
insanity
if
you
think
that
what
you
have
heard
establishes
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
forgery
you
will
find
him
guilty
but
insane
if
on
the
other
hand
you
conclude
from
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
that
the
prisoner
was
sane
and
nothing
short
of
insanity
will
count
you
will
find
him
guilty
in
reviewing
the
testimony
as
to
his
mental
condition
you
must
bear
in
mind
very
carefully
the
evidence
as
to
his
demeanour
and
conduct
both
before
and
after
the
act
of
forgery
the
evidence
of
the
prisoner
himself
of
the
woman
of
the
witness
er
cokeson
and
er
of
the
cashier
and
in
regard
to
that
i
especially
direct
your
attention
to
the
prisoner
admission
that
the
idea
of
adding
the
and
the
nought
did
come
into
his
mind
at
the
moment
when
the
cheque
was
handed
to
him
and
also
to
the
alteration
of
the
counterfoil
and
to
his
subsequent
conduct
generally
the
bearing
of
all
this
on
the
question
of
premeditation
and
premeditation
will
imply
sanity
is
very
obvious
you
must
not
allow
any
considerations
of
age
or
temptation
to
weigh
with
you
in
the
finding
of
your
verdict
before
you
can
come
to
a
verdict
of
guilty
but
insane
you
must
be
well
and
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
condition
of
his
mind
was
such
as
would
have
qualified
him
at
the
moment
for
a
lunatic
asylum
he
pauses
then
seeing
that
the
jury
are
doubtful
whether
to
retire
or
no
adds
you
may
retire
gentlemen
if
you
wish
to
do
so
the
jury
retire
by
a
door
behind
the
judge
the
judge
bends
over
his
notes
falder
leaning
from
the
dock
speaks
excitedly
to
his
solicitor
pointing
dawn
at
ruth
the
solicitor
in
turn
speaks
to
frome
frome
rising
my
lord
the
prisoner
is
very
anxious
that
i
should
ask
you
if
your
lordship
would
kindly
request
the
reporters
not
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
woman
witness
in
the
press
reports
of
these
proceedings
your
lordship
will
understand
that
the
consequences
might
be
extremely
serious
to
her
the
judge
pointedly
with
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
well
frome
you
deliberately
took
this
course
which
involved
bringing
her
here
frome
with
an
ironic
bow
if
your
lordship
thinks
i
could
have
brought
out
the
full
facts
in
any
other
way
the
judge
h
well
frome
there
is
very
real
danger
to
her
your
lordship
the
judge
you
see
i
have
to
take
your
word
for
all
that
frome
if
your
lordship
would
be
so
kind
i
can
assure
your
lordship
that
i
am
not
exaggerating
the
judge
it
goes
very
much
against
the
grain
with
me
that
the
name
of
a
witness
should
ever
be
suppressed
with
a
glance
at
falder
who
is
gripping
and
clasping
his
hands
before
him
and
then
at
ruth
who
is
sitting
perfectly
rigid
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
falder
consider
your
application
it
must
depend
i
have
to
remember
that
she
may
have
come
here
to
commit
perjury
on
the
prisoner
behalf
frome
your
lordship
i
really
the
judge
yes
yes
i
do
suggest
anything
of
the
sort
frome
leave
it
at
that
for
the
moment
as
he
finishes
speaking
the
jury
return
and
file
back
into
the
box
clerk
of
assize
gentlemen
are
you
agreed
on
your
verdict
foreman
we
are
clerk
of
assize
is
it
guilty
or
guilty
but
insane
foreman
guilty
the
judge
nods
then
gathering
up
his
notes
sits
looking
at
falder
who
stands
motionless
frome
rising
if
your
lordship
would
allow
me
to
address
you
in
mitigation
of
sentence
i
do
know
if
your
lordship
thinks
i
can
add
anything
to
what
i
have
said
to
the
jury
on
the
score
of
the
prisoner
youth
and
the
great
stress
under
which
he
acted
the
judge
i
do
think
you
can
frome
frome
if
your
lordship
says
so
i
do
most
earnestly
beg
your
lordship
to
give
the
utmost
weight
to
my
plea
he
sits
down
the
judge
to
the
clerk
call
upon
him
the
clerk
prisoner
at
the
bar
you
stand
convicted
of
felony
have
you
anything
to
say
for
yourself
why
the
court
should
not
give
you
judgment
according
to
law
falder
shakes
his
head
the
judge
william
falder
you
have
been
given
fair
trial
and
found
guilty
in
my
opinion
rightly
found
guilty
of
forgery
he
pauses
then
consulting
his
notes
goes
on
the
defence
was
set
up
that
you
were
not
responsible
for
your
actions
at
the
moment
of
committing
this
crime
there
is
no
doubt
i
think
that
this
was
a
device
to
bring
out
at
first
hand
the
nature
of
the
temptation
to
which
you
succumbed
for
throughout
the
trial
your
counsel
was
in
reality
making
an
appeal
for
mercy
the
setting
up
of
this
defence
of
course
enabled
him
to
put
in
some
evidence
that
might
weigh
in
that
direction
whether
he
was
well
advised
to
so
is
another
matter
he
claimed
that
you
should
be
treated
rather
as
a
patient
than
as
a
criminal
and
this
plea
of
his
which
in
the
end
amounted
to
a
passionate
appeal
he
based
in
effect
on
an
indictment
of
the
march
of
justice
which
he
practically
accused
of
confirming
and
completing
the
process
of
criminality
now
in
considering
how
far
i
should
allow
weight
to
his
appeal
i
have
a
number
of
factors
to
take
into
account
i
have
to
consider
on
the
one
hand
the
grave
nature
of
your
offence
the
deliberate
way
in
which
you
subsequently
altered
the
counterfoil
the
danger
you
caused
to
an
innocent
man
and
that
to
my
mind
is
a
very
grave
point
and
finally
i
have
to
consider
the
necessity
of
deterring
others
from
following
your
example
on
the
other
hand
i
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
you
are
young
that
you
have
hitherto
borne
a
good
character
that
you
were
if
i
am
to
believe
your
evidence
and
that
of
your
witnesses
in
a
state
of
some
emotional
excitement
when
you
committed
this
crime
i
have
every
wish
consistently
with
my
duty
not
only
to
you
but
to
the
community
to
treat
you
with
leniency
and
this
brings
me
to
what
are
the
determining
factors
in
my
mind
in
my
consideration
of
your
case
you
are
a
clerk
in
a
lawyer
office
that
is
a
very
serious
element
in
this
case
there
can
be
no
possible
excuse
made
for
you
on
the
ground
that
you
were
not
fully
conversant
with
the
nature
of
the
crime
you
were
committing
and
the
penalties
that
attach
to
it
it
is
said
however
that
you
were
carried
away
by
your
emotions
the
story
has
been
told
here
of
your
relations
with
this
er
honeywill
on
that
story
both
the
defence
and
the
plea
for
mercy
were
in
effect
based
now
what
is
that
story
it
is
that
you
a
young
man
and
she
a
young
woman
unhappily
married
had
formed
an
attachment
which
you
both
say
with
what
truth
i
am
unable
to
gauge
had
not
yet
resulted
in
immoral
relations
but
which
you
both
admit
was
about
to
result
in
such
relationship
your
counsel
has
made
an
attempt
to
palliate
this
on
the
ground
that
the
woman
is
in
what
he
describes
i
think
as
a
hopeless
position
as
to
that
i
can
express
no
opinion
she
is
a
married
woman
and
the
fact
is
patent
that
you
committed
this
crime
with
the
view
of
furthering
an
immoral
design
now
however
i
might
wish
i
am
not
able
to
justify
to
my
conscience
a
plea
for
mercy
which
has
a
basis
inimical
to
morality
it
is
vitiated
initio
and
would
if
successful
free
you
for
the
completion
of
this
immoral
project
your
counsel
has
made
an
attempt
to
trace
your
offence
back
to
what
he
seems
to
suggest
is
a
defect
in
the
marriage
law
he
has
made
an
attempt
also
to
show
that
to
punish
you
with
further
imprisonment
would
be
unjust
i
do
not
follow
him
in
these
flights
the
law
is
what
it
is
a
majestic
edifice
sheltering
all
of
us
each
stone
of
which
rests
on
another
i
am
concerned
only
with
its
administration
the
crime
you
have
committed
is
a
very
serious
one
i
can
not
feel
it
in
accordance
with
my
duty
to
society
to
exercise
the
powers
i
have
in
your
favour
you
will
go
to
penal
servitude

three
years

the
governor
those
are
local
prisoners
the
convicts
serve
their
three
months
here
in
separate
confinement
sir
cokeson
but
we
do
want
to
be
unreasonable
he
quite
downhearted
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
let
him
run
about
with
the
others
the
governor
with
faint
amusement
ring
the
you
miller
to
cokeson
you
like
to
hear
what
the
doctor
says
about
him
perhaps
the
chaplain
ringing
the
bell
you
are
not
accustomed
to
prisons
it
would
seem
sir
cokeson
no
but
it
a
pitiful
sight
he
quite
a
young
fellow
i
said
to
him
before
a
month
up
i
said
you
be
out
and
about
with
the
others
it
be
a
nice
change
for
you
a
month
he
said
like
that
come
i
said
we
must
exaggerate
what
a
month
why
it
nothing
a
day
he
said
shut
up
in
your
cell
thinking
and
brooding
as
i
do
it
longer
than
a
year
outside
i
ca
help
it
he
said
i
try
but
i
built
that
way
mr
cokeson
and
he
held
his
hand
up
to
his
face
i
could
see
the
tears
trickling
through
his
fingers
it
was
nice
the
chaplain
he
a
young
man
with
large
rather
peculiar
eyes
is
he
not
church
of
england
i
think
cokeson
no
the
chaplain
i
know
the
governor
to
wooder
who
has
come
in
ask
the
doctor
to
be
good
enough
to
come
here
for
a
minute
wooder
salutes
and
goes
out
let
see
he
not
married
cokeson
no
confidentially
but
there
a
party
he
very
much
attached
to
not
altogether
it
a
sad
story
the
chaplain
if
it
was
for
drink
and
women
sir
this
prison
might
be
closed
cokeson
looking
at
the
chaplain
over
his
spectacles
but
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
that
special
he
had
hopes
they
have
let
her
come
and
see
him
but
they
have
of
course
he
asked
me
questions
i
did
my
best
but
i
could
tell
the
poor
young
fellow
a
lie
with
him
in
here
seemed
like
hitting
him
but
i
afraid
it
made
him
worse
the
governor
what
was
this
news
then
cokeson
like
this
the
woman
had
a
nahsty
spiteful
feller
for
a
husband
and
she
left
him
fact
is
she
was
going
away
with
our
young
friend
it
not
nice
but
i
looked
over
it
well
when
he
was
put
in
here
she
said
she
earn
her
living
apart
and
wait
for
him
to
come
out
that
was
a
great
consolation
to
him
but
after
a
month
she
came
to
me
i
do
know
her
personally
and
she
said
i
ca
earn
the
children
living
let
alone
my
own
i
got
no
friends
i
obliged
to
keep
out
of
everybody
way
else
my
husband
get
to
know
where
i
was
i
very
much
reduced
she
said
and
she
has
lost
flesh
i
have
to
go
in
the
workhouse
it
a
painful
story
i
said
to
her
no
i
said
not
that
i
got
a
wife
an
family
but
sooner
than
you
should
do
that
i
spare
you
a
little
myself
really
she
said
she
a
nice
creature
i
like
to
take
it
from
you
i
think
i
better
go
back
to
my
husband
well
i
know
he
a
nahsty
spiteful
feller
drinks
but
i
like
to
persuade
her
not
to
the
chaplain
surely
no
cokeson
but
i
sorry
now
it
upset
the
poor
young
fellow
dreadfully
and
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
he
got
his
three
years
to
serve
i
want
things
to
be
pleasant
for
him
the
chaplain
with
a
touch
of
impatience
the
law
hardly
shares
your
view
i
afraid
cokeson
but
i
ca
help
thinking
that
to
shut
him
up
there
by
himself
turn
him
silly
and
nobody
wants
that
i
i
like
to
see
a
man
cry
the
chaplain
it
a
very
rare
thing
for
them
to
give
way
like
that
cokeson
looking
at
a
tone
of
sudden
dogged
hostility
i
keep
dogs
the
chaplain
indeed
cokeson
and
i
say
this
i
would
shut
one
of
them
up
all
by
himself
month
after
month
not
if
he
bit
me
all
over
the
chaplain
unfortunately
the
criminal
is
not
a
dog
he
has
a
sense
of
right
and
wrong
cokeson
but
that
not
the
way
to
make
him
feel
it
the
chaplain
ah
there
i
afraid
we
must
differ
cokeson
it
the
same
with
dogs
if
you
treat
with
kindness
they
do
anything
for
you
but
to
shut
up
alone
it
only
makes
savage
the
chaplain
surely
you
should
allow
those
who
have
had
a
little
more
experience
than
yourself
to
know
what
is
best
for
prisoners
cokeson
doggedly
i
know
this
young
feller
i
watched
him
for
years
he
eurotic
got
no
stamina
his
father
died
of
consumption
i
thinking
of
his
future
if
he
to
be
kept
there
shut
up
by
himself
without
a
cat
to
keep
him
company
it
do
him
harm
i
said
to
him
where
do
you
feel
it
i
ca
tell
you
cokeson
he
said
but
sometimes
i
could
beat
my
head
against
the
wall
it
not
nice
during
this
speech
the
doctor
has
entered
he
is
a
rather
man
with
a
quick
eye
he
stands
leaning
against
the
window
the
governor
this
gentleman
thinks
the
separate
is
telling
on
q
falder
young
thin
fellow
star
class
what
do
you
say
doctor
clements
the
doctor
he
does
like
it
but
it
not
doing
him
any
harm
cokeson
but
he
told
me
the
doctor
of
course
he
say
so
but
we
can
always
tell
lost
no
weight
since
he
been
here
cokeson
it
his
state
of
mind
i
speaking
of
the
doctor
his
mind
all
right
so
far
he
nervous
rather
melancholy
i
do
see
signs
of
anything
more
i
watching
him
carefully
cokeson
nonplussed
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
the
chaplain
more
suavely
it
just
at
this
period
that
we
are
able
to
make
some
impression
on
them
sir
i
am
speaking
from
my
special
standpoint
cokeson
turning
bewildered
to
the
governor
i
do
want
to
be
unpleasant
but
having
given
him
this
news
i
do
feel
it
awkward
the
governor
i
make
a
point
of
seeing
him
cokeson
i
much
obliged
to
you
i
thought
perhaps
seeing
him
every
day
you
would
notice
it
the
governor
rather
sharply
if
any
sign
of
injury
to
his
health
shows
itself
his
case
will
be
reported
at
once
that
fully
provided
for
he
rises
cokeson
following
his
own
thoughts
of
course
what
you
do
see
does
trouble
you
but
having
seen
him
i
do
want
to
have
him
on
my
mind
the
governor
i
think
you
may
safely
leave
it
to
us
sir
cokeson
mollified
and
apologetic
i
thought
you
understand
me
i
a
plain
man
never
set
myself
up
against
authority
expanding
to
the
chaplain
nothing
personal
meant
as
he
goes
out
the
three
officials
do
not
look
at
each
other
but
their
faces
wear
peculiar
expressions
the
chaplain
our
friend
seems
to
think
that
prison
is
a
hospital
cokeson
returning
suddenly
with
an
apologetic
air
there
just
one
little
thing
this
woman
i
suppose
i
must
ask
you
to
let
him
see
her
it
be
a
rare
treat
for
them
both
he
thinking
about
her
all
the
time
of
course
she
not
his
wife
but
he
quite
safe
in
here
they
a
pitiful
couple
you
could
make
an
exception
the
governor
wearily
as
you
say
my
dear
sir
i
could
make
an
exception
he
wo
be
allowed
another
visit
of
any
sort
till
he
goes
to
a
convict
prison
cokeson
i
see
rather
coldly
sorry
to
have
troubled
you
he
again
goes
out
the
chaplain
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
plain
man
indeed
poor
fellow
come
and
have
some
lunch
clements
he
and
the
doctor
go
out
talking
the
governor
with
a
sigh
sits
down
at
his
table
and
takes
up
a
pen

curtain

find
a
better
way
than
this
moaney
sullenly
well
what
way

must
keep
my
hand
in
against
the
time
i
get
out
what
the
good
of
anything

to
me
at

got
mine
seeing

o

small
thick
oldish
man
with
an
almost
shaven

the
doctor

come
here
wooder
wooder
salutes
and
goes
away
down
the
corridor
the
governor
goes
to
the
door
of
falder
cell
he
raises
his
uninjured
hand
to
uncover
the
but
without
uncovering
it
shakes
his
head
and
drops
his
hand
then
after
scrutinising
the
record
board
he
opens
the
cell
door
falder
who
is
standing
against
it
lurches
forward
the
governor

breathless
voice

your
head
against
a
stone
wall

little
between

up

worst
time
the
governor
how
that
falder
his
lips
twitch
with
a
sort
of
smile
i
do
know
sir
i
was
always
nervous
suddenly
voluble
everything
seems
to
get
such
a
size
then
i
feel
i
never
get
out
as
long
as
i
live
the
governor
that
morbid
my
lad
pull
yourself
together
falder
with
an
equally
sudden
dogged
resentment

got
to
the
governor

of
all
these
other
fellows
falder
they
used
to
it
the
governor
they
all
had
to
go
through
it
once
for
the
first
time
just
as
you
doing
now
falder
yes
sir
i
shall
get
to
be
like
them
in
time
i
suppose
the
governor
rather
taken
aback
h
well
that
rests
with
you
now
come
set
your
mind
to
it
like
a
good
fellow
still
quite
young
a
man
can
make
himself
what
he
likes
falder
wistfully
yes
sir
the
governor
take
a
good
hold
of
yourself
do
you
read
falder
i
do
take
the
words
in
hanging
his
head
i
know
no
good
but
i
ca
help
thinking
of
what
going
on
outside
in
my
cell
i
ca
see
out
at
all
it
thick
glass
sir
the
governor
you
had
a
visitor
bad
news
falder
yes
the
governor
you
must
think
about
it
falder
looking
back
at
his
cell
how
can
i
help
it
sir
he
suddenly
becomes
motionless
as
wooder
and
the
doctor
approach
the
governor
motions
to
him
to
go
back
into
his
cell
falder
quick
and
low
i
quite
right
in
my
head
sir
he
goes
back
into
his
cell
the
governor
to
the
doctor
just
go
in
and
see
him
clements
the
doctor
goes
into
the
cell
the
governor
pushes
the
door
to
nearly
closing
it
and
walks
towards
the
window
wooder
following
sorry
you
should
be
troubled
like
this
sir
very
contented
lot
of
men
on
the
whole
the
governor
shortly
you
think
so
wooder
yes
sir
it
christmas
doing
it
in
my
opinion
the
governor
to
himself
queer
that
wooder
beg
pardon
sir
the
governor
christmas
he
turns
towards
the
window
leaving
wooder
looking
at
him
with
a
sort
of
pained
anxiety
wooder
suddenly
do
you
think
we
make
show
enough
sir
if
like
us
to
have
more
holly
the
governor
not
at
all
wooder
wooder
very
good
sir
the
doctor
has
come
out
of
falder
cell
and
the
governor
beckons
to
him
the
governor
well
the
doctor
i
ca
make
anything
much
of
him
he
nervous
of
course
the
governor
is
there
any
sort
of
case
to
report
quite
frankly
doctor
the
doctor
well
i
do
think
the
separates
doing
him
any
good
but
then
i
could
say
the
same
of
a
lot
of
them
they
get
on
better
in
the
shops
there
no
doubt
the
governor
you
mean
you
have
to
recommend
others
the
doctor
a
dozen
at
least
it
on
his
nerves
there
nothing
tangible
that
fellow
there
pointing
to
cell
for
instance
feels
it
just
as
much
in
his
way
if
i
once
get
away
from
physical
facts
i
sha
know
where
i
am
conscientiously
sir
i
do
know
how
to
differentiate
him
he
has
lost
weight
nothing
wrong
with
his
eyes
his
pulse
is
good
talks
all
right
the
governor
it
does
amount
to
melancholia
the
doctor
shaking
his
head
i
can
report
on
him
if
you
like
but
if
i
do
i
ought
to
report
on
others
the
governor
i
see
looking
towards
falder
cell
the
poor
devil
must
just
stick
it
then
as
he
says
thin
he
looks
absently
at
wooder
wooder
beg
pardon
sir
for
answer
the
governor
stares
at
him
turns
on
his
heel
and
walks
away
there
is
a
sound
as
of
beating
on
metal
the
governor
stopping
wooder
wooder
banging
on
his
door
sir
i
thought
we
should
have
more
of
that
he
hurries
forward
passing
the
governor
who
follows
closely
the
curtain
falls

books
piled
in

pyramid
there
are

and

in

on
which
the

about

covering

under
the
window
in
daylight
falder
in
his
stockings
is
seen
standing
motionless
with
his
head
inclined
towards
the
door
listening
he
moves
a
little
closer
to
the
door
his
stockinged
feet
making
no
noise
he
stops
at
the
door
he
is
trying
harder
and
harder
to
hear
something
any
little
thing
that
is
going
on
outside
he
springs
suddenly
upright
as
if
at
a
remains
perfectly
motionless
then
with
a
heavy
sigh
he
moves
to
his
work
and
stands
looking
at
it
with
his
head
doom
he
does
a
stitch
or
two
having
the
air
of
a
man
so
lost
in
sadness
that
each
stitch
is
as
it
were
a
coming
to
life
then
turning
abruptly
he
begins
pacing
the
cell
moving
his
head
like
an
animal
pacing
its
cage
he
stops
again
at
the
door
listens
and
placing
the
palms
of
hip
hands
against
it
with
his
fingers
spread
out
leans
his
forehead
against
the
iron
turning
from
it
presently
he
moves
slowly
back
towards
the
window
tracing
his
way
with
his
finger
along
the
top
line
of
the
distemper
that
runs
round
the
wall
he
stops
under
the
window
and
picking
up
the
lid
of
one
of
the
tins
peers
into
it
it
has
grown
very
nearly
dark
suddenly
the
lid
falls
out
of
his
hand
with
a
clatter
the
only
sound
that
has
broken
the
silence
and
he
stands
staring
intently
at
the
wall
where
the
stuff
of
the
shirt
is
hanging
rather
white
in
the
darkness
he
seems
to
be
seeing
somebody
or
something
there
there
is
a
sharp
tap
and
click
the
cell
light
behind
the
glass
screen
has
been
turned
up
the
cell
is
brightly
lighted
falder
is
seen
gasping
for
breath
a
sound
from
far
away
as
of
distant
dull
beating
on
thick
metal
is
suddenly
audible
falder
shrinks
back
not
able
to
bear
this
sudden
clamour
but
the
sound
grows
as
though
some
great
tumbril
were
rolling
towards
the
cell
and
gradually
it
seems
to
hypnotise
him
he
begins
creeping
inch
by
inch
nearer
to
the
door
the
banging
sound
travelling
from
cell
to
cell
draws
closer
and
closer
falder
hands
are
seen
moving
as
if
his
spirit
had
already
joined
in
this
beating
and
the
sound
swells
till
it
seems
to
have
entered
the
very
cell
he
suddenly
raises
his
clenched
fists
panting
violently
he
flings
himself
at
his
door
and
beats
on
it
the
curtain
falls
act
iv
the
scene
is
again
cokeson
room
at
a
few
minutes
to
ten
of
a
march
morning
two
years
later
the
doors
are
all
open
sweedle
now
blessed
with
a
sprouting
moustache
is
getting
the
offices
ready
he
arranges
papers
on
cokeson
table
then
goes
to
a
covered
washstand
raises
the
lid
and
looks
at
himself
in
the
mirror
while
he
is
gazing
his
full
ruth
honeywill
comes
in
through
the
outer
office
and
stands
in
the
doorway
there
seems
a
kind
of
exultation
and
excitement
behind
her
habitual
impassivity
sweedle
suddenly
seeing
her
and
dropping
the
lid
of
the
washstand
with
a
bang
hello
it
you
ruth
yes
sweedle
there
only
me
here
they
do
waste
their
time
hurrying
down
in
the
morning
why
it
must
be
two
years
since
we
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
nervously
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
ruth
sardonically
living
sweedle
impressed
if
you
want
to
see
him
he
points
to
chair
he
be
here
directly
never
misses
not
much
delicately
i
hope
our
friend
back
from
the
country
his
time
been
up
these
three
months
if
i
remember
ruth
nods
i
was
awful
sorry
about
that
the
governor
made
a
mistake
if
you
ask
me
ruth
he
did
sweedle
he
ought
to
have
given
him
a
chanst
and
i
say
the
judge
ought
to
ha
let
him
go
after
that
they
forgot
what
human
nature
like
whereas
we
know
ruth
gives
him
a
honeyed
smile
sweedle
they
come
down
on
you
like
a
cartload
of
bricks
flatten
you
out
and
when
you
do
swell
up
again
they
complain
of
it
i
know
seen
a
lot
of
that
sort
of
thing
in
my
time
he
shakes
his
head
in
the
plenitude
of
wisdom
why
only
the
other
day
the
governor
but
cokeson
has
come
in
through
the
outer
office
brisk
with
east
wind
and
decidedly
greyer
cokeson
drawing
off
his
coat
and
gloves
why
it
you
then
motioning
sweedle
out
and
closing
the
door
quite
a
stranger
must
be
two
years
want
to
see
me
i
can
give
you
a
minute
sit
down
family
well
ruth
yes
i
not
living
where
i
was
cokeson
eyeing
her
askance
i
hope
things
are
more
comfortable
at
home
ruth
i
could
stay
with
honeywill
after
all
cokeson
you
have
done
anything
rash
i
hope
i
should
be
sorry
if
you
done
anything
rash
ruth
i
kept
the
children
with
me
cokeson
beginning
to
feel
that
things
are
not
so
jolly
as
ha
had
hoped
well
i
glad
to
have
seen
you
you
not
heard
from
the
young
man
i
suppose
since
he
came
out
ruth
yes
i
ran
across
him
yesterday
cokeson
i
hope
he
well
ruth
with
sudden
fierceness
he
ca
get
anything
to
do
dreadful
to
see
him
he
just
skin
and
bone
cokeson
with
genuine
concern
dear
me
i
sorry
to
hear
that
on
his
guard
again
did
they
find
him
a
place
when
his
time
was
up
ruth
he
was
only
there
three
weeks
it
got
out
cokeson
i
sure
i
do
know
what
i
can
do
for
you
i
do
like
to
be
snubby
ruth
i
ca
bear
his
being
like
that
cokeson
scanning
her
not
unprosperous
figure
i
know
his
relations
are
very
forthy
about
him
perhaps
you
can
do
something
for
him
till
he
finds
his
feet
ruth
not
now
i
could
have
but
not
now
cokeson
i
do
understand
ruth
proudly
i
seen
him
again
that
all
over
cokeson
staring
at
her
disturbed
i
a
family
man
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
unpleasant
excuse
me
i
very
busy
ruth
i
have
gone
home
to
my
people
in
the
country
long
ago
but
they
never
got
over
me
marrying
honeywill
i
never
was
waywise
cokeson
but
i
proud
i
was
only
a
girl
you
see
when
i
married
him
i
thought
the
world
of
him
of
course
he
used
to
come
travelling
to
our
farm
cokeson
regretfully
i
did
hope
you
have
got
on
better
after
you
saw
me
ruth
he
used
me
worse
than
ever
he
could
break
my
nerve
but
i
lost
my
health
and
then
he
began
knocking
the
children
about
i
could
stand
that
i
would
go
back
now
if
he
were
dying
cokeson
who
has
risen
and
is
shifting
about
as
though
dodging
a
stream
of
lava
we
must
be
violent
must
we
ruth
smouldering
a
man
that
ca
behave
better
than
that
there
is
silence
cokeson
fascinated
in
spite
of
himself
then
there
you
were
and
what
did
you
do
then
ruth
with
a
shrug
tried
the
same
as
when
i
left
him
before
making
skirts
cheap
things
it
was
the
best
i
could
get
but
i
never
made
more
than
ten
shillings
a
week
buying
my
own
cotton
and
working
all
day
i
hardly
ever
got
to
bed
till
past
twelve
i
kept
at
it
for
nine
months
fiercely
well
i
not
fit
for
that
i
was
made
for
it
i
rather
die
cokeson
my
dear
woman
we
must
talk
like
that
ruth
it
was
starvation
for
the
children
too
after
what
always
had
i
soon
got
not
to
care
i
used
to
be
too
tired
she
is
silent
cokeson
with
fearful
curiosity
why
what
happened
then
ruth
with
a
laugh
my
employer
happened
then
he
happened
ever
since
cokeson
dear
oh
dear
i
never
came
across
a
thing
like
this
ruth
dully
he
treated
me
all
right
but
i
done
with
that
suddenly
her
lips
begin
to
quiver
and
she
hides
them
with
the
back
of
her
hand
i
never
thought
i
see
him
again
you
see
it
was
just
a
chance
i
met
him
by
hyde
park
we
went
in
there
and
sat
down
and
he
told
me
all
about
himself
oh
cokeson
give
him
another
chance
cokeson
greatly
disturbed
then
you
both
lost
your
livings
what
a
horrible
position
ruth
if
he
could
only
get
here
where
there
nothing
to
find
out
about
him
cokeson
we
ca
have
anything
derogative
to
the
firm
ruth
i
no
one
else
to
go
to
cokeson
i
speak
to
the
partners
but
i
do
think
they
take
him
under
the
circumstances
i
do
really
ruth
he
came
with
me
he
down
there
in
the
street
she
points
to
the
window
cokeson
on
his
dignity
he
should
have
done
that
until
sent
for
then
softening
at
the
look
on
her
face
we
got
a
vacancy
as
it
happens
but
i
ca
promise
anything
ruth
it
would
be
the
saving
of
him
cokeson
well
i
do
what
i
can
but
i
not
sanguine
now
tell
him
that
i
do
want
him
till
i
see
how
things
are
leave
your
address
repeating
her
mullingar
street
he
notes
it
on
ruth
thank
you
she
moves
towards
the
door
turns
as
if
to
speak
but
does
not
and
goes
away
cokeson
wiping
his
head
and
forehead
with
a
large
white
cotton
handkerchief
what
a
business
then
looking
amongst
his
papers
he
sounds
his
bell

richards

him
round
to
see
me
now
treat
him
like
you
have
him
treat
you
in
a
similar
position
sweedle
i
naturally
should
do
cokeson
that
right
when
a
man
down
never
hit
necessary
give
him
a
hand
up
that
a
metaphor
i
recommend
to
you
in
life
it
sound
policy
sweedle
do
you
think
the
governors
will
take
him
on
again
sir
cokeson
ca
say
anything
about
that
at
the
sound
of
some
one
having
entered
the
outer
office
who
there
sweedle
going
to
the
door
and
looking
it
falder
sir
cokeson
vexed
dear
me
that
very
naughty
of
her
tell
him
to
call
again
i
do
want
he
breaks
off
as
falder
comes
in
falder
is
thin
pale
older
his
eyes
have
grown
more
restless
his
clothes
are
very
worn
and
loose
sweedle
nodding
cheerfully
withdraws
cokeson
glad
to
see
you
you
rather
previous
trying
to
keep
things
pleasant
shake
hands
she
striking
while
the
iron
hot
he
wipes
his
forehead
i
do
blame
her
she
anxious
falder
timidly
takes
cokeson
hand
and
glances
towards
the
partners
door
cokeson
no
not
yet
sit
down
falder
sits
in
the
chair
at
the
aide
of
cokeson
table
on
which
he
places
his
cap
now
you
are
here
i
like
you
to
give
me
a
little
account
of
yourself
looking
at
him
over
his
spectacles
how
your
health
falder
i
alive
cokeson
cokeson
preoccupied
i
glad
to
hear
that
about
this
matter
i
do
like
doing
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
it
not
my
habit
i
a
plain
man
and
i
want
everything
smooth
and
straight
but
i
promised
your
friend
to
speak
to
the
partners
and
i
always
keep
my
word
falder
i
just
want
a
chance
cokeson
i
paid
for
that
job
a
thousand
times
and
more
i
have
sir
no
one
knows
they
say
i
weighed
more
when
i
came
out
than
when
i
went
in
they
weigh
me
here
he
touches
his
head
or
here
he
touches
his
heart
and
gives
a
sort
of
laugh
till
last
night
i
have
thought
there
was
nothing
in
here
at
all
cokeson
concerned
you
not
got
heart
disease
falder
oh
they
passed
me
sound
enough
cokeson
but
they
got
you
a
place
did
they
falser
yes
very
good
people
knew
all
about
it
very
kind
to
me
i
thought
i
was
going
to
get
on
first
rate
but
one
day
all
of
a
sudden
the
other
clerks
got
wind
of
it
i
could
stick
it
cokeson
i
could
sir
cokeson
easy
my
dear
fellow
easy
falder
i
had
one
small
job
after
that
but
it
did
last
cokeson
how
was
that
falder
it
no
good
deceiving
you
cokeson
the
fact
is
i
seem
to
be
struggling
against
a
thing
that
all
round
me
i
explain
it
it
as
if
i
was
in
a
net
as
fast
as
i
cut
it
here
it
grows
up
there
i
did
act
as
i
ought
to
have
about
references
but
what
are
you
to
do
you
must
have
them
and
that
made
me
afraid
and
i
left
in
fact
i
i
afraid
all
the
time
now
he
bows
his
head
and
leans
dejectedly
silent
over
the
table
cokeson
i
feel
for
you
i
do
really
are
your
sisters
going
to
do
anything
for
you
falder
one
in
consumption
and
the
other
cokeson
ye
es
she
told
me
her
husband
was
quite
pleased
with
you
falder
when
i
went
there
they
were
at
supper
my
sister
wanted
to
give
me
a
kiss
i
know
but
he
just
looked
at
her
and
said
what
have
you
come
for
well
i
pocketed
my
pride
and
i
said
you
going
to
give
me
your
hand
jim
cis
is
i
know
i
said
look
here
he
said
that
all
very
well
but
we
better
come
to
an
understanding
i
been
expecting
you
and
i
made
up
my
mind
i
give
you
fifteen
pounds
to
go
to
canada
with
i
see
i
said
good
riddance
no
thanks
keep
your
fifteen
pounds
friendship
a
queer
thing
when
you
been
where
i
have
cokeson
i
understand
will
you
take
the
fifteen
pound
from
me
flustered
as
falder
regards
him
with
a
queer
smile
quite
without
prejudice
i
meant
it
kindly
falder
i
not
allowed
to
leave
the
country
cokeson
oh
ye
es
you
are
looking
the
thing
falder
i
slept
in
the
park
three
nights
this
week
the
dawns
are
all
poetry
there
but
meeting
her
i
feel
a
different
man
this
morning
i
often
thought
the
being
fond
of
hers
the
best
thing
about
me
it
sacred
somehow
and
yet
it
did
for
me
queer
is
it
cokeson
i
sure
we
all
very
sorry
for
you
falder
that
what
i
found
cokeson
awfully
sorry
for
me
with
quiet
bitterness
but
it
does
do
to
associate
with
criminals
cokeson
come
come
it
no
use
calling
yourself
names
that
never
did
a
man
any
good
put
a
face
on
it
falder
it
easy
enough
to
put
a
face
on
it
sir
when
independent
try
it
when
you
down
like
me
they
talk
about
giving
you
your
deserts
well
i
think
i
had
just
a
bit
over
cokeson
eyeing
him
askance
over
his
spectacles
i
hope
they
made
a
socialist
of
you
falder
is
suddenly
still
as
if
brooding
over
his
past
self
he
utters
a
peculiar
laugh
cokeson
you
must
give
them
credit
for
the
best
intentions
really
you
must
nobody
wishes
you
harm
i
sure
falder
i
believe
that
cokeson
nobody
wishes
you
harm
but
they
down
you
all
the
same
this
feeling
he
stares
round
him
as
though
at
something
closing
in
it
crushing
me
with
sudden
impersonality
i
know
it
is
cokeson
horribly
disturbed
there
nothing
there
we
must
try
and
take
it
quiet
i
sure
i
often
had
you
in
my
prayers
now
leave
it
to
me
i
use
my
gumption
and
take
when
jolly
as
he
speaks
the
two
partners
come
in
cokeson
rather
disconcerted
but
trying
to
put
them
all
at
ease
i
did
expect
you
quite
so
soon
i
just
been
having
a
talk
with
this
young
man
i
think
you
remember
him
james
with
a
grave
keen
look
quite
well
how
are
you
falder
walter
holding
out
his
hand
almost
timidly
very
glad
to
see
you
again
falder
falder
who
has
recovered
his
takes
the
hand
thank
you
sir
cokeson
just
a
word
james
to
falder
pointing
to
the
clerks
office
you
might
go
in
there
a
minute
you
know
your
way
our
junior
wo
be
coming
this
morning
his
wife
just
had
a
little
family
falder
goes
uncertainly
out
into
the
clerks
office
cokeson
confidentially
i
bound
to
tell
you
all
about
it
quite
penitent
but
there
a
prejudice
against
him
and
you
not
seeing
him
to
advantage
this
morning
he
very
trying
to
go
without
your
dinner
james
is
that
so
cokeson
cokeson
i
wanted
to
ask
you
he
had
his
lesson
now
we
know
all
about
him
and
we
want
a
clerk
there
is
a
young
fellow
applying
but
i
keeping
him
in
the
air
james
a
in
the
office
cokeson
i
do
see
it
walter
the
rolling
of
the
of
justice
i
never
got
that
out
of
my
head
james
i
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
in
this
affair
he
been
doing
since
he
came
out
cokeson
he
had
one
or
two
places
but
he
has
kept
them
sensitive
quite
natural
seems
to
fancy
everybody
down
on
him
james
bad
sign
do
like
the
fellow
never
did
from
the
first
weak
character
written
all
over
him
walter
i
think
we
owe
him
a
leg
up
james
he
brought
it
all
on
himself
walter
the
doctrine
of
full
responsibility
does
quite
hold
in
these
days
james
rather
grimly
you
find
it
safer
to
hold
it
for
all
that
my
boy
walter
for
oneself
yes
not
for
other
people
thanks
james
well
i
do
want
to
be
hard
cokeson
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
he
seems
to
see
something
spreading
his
arms
round
him
is
healthy
james
what
about
that
woman
he
was
mixed
up
with
i
saw
some
one
uncommonly
like
her
outside
as
we
came
in
cokeson
that
well
i
ca
keep
anything
from
you
he
has
met
her
james
is
she
with
her
husband
cokeson
no
james
falder
living
with
her
i
suppose
cokeson
desperately
trying
to
retain
the
jollity
i
do
know
that
of
my
own
knowledge
is
my
business
james
it
our
business
if
we
going
to
engage
him
cokeson
cokeson
reluctantly
i
ought
to
tell
you
perhaps
i
had
the
party
here
this
morning
james
i
thought
so
to
walter
no
my
dear
boy
it
wo
do
too
shady
altogether
cokeson
the
two
things
together
make
it
very
awkward
for
you
i
see
that
walter
tentatively
i
do
quite
know
what
we
have
to
do
with
his
private
life
james
no
no
he
must
make
a
clean
sheet
of
it
or
he
ca
come
here
walter
poor
devil
cokeson
will
you
have
him
in
and
as
james
nods
i
think
i
can
get
him
to
see
reason
james
grimly
you
can
leave
that
to
me
cokeson
walter
to
james
in
a
low
voice
while
cokeson
is
summoning
falder
his
whole
future
may
depend
on
what
we
do
dad
falder
comes
in
he
has
pulled
himself
together
and
presents
a
steady
front
james
now
look
here
falder
my
son
and
i
want
to
give
you
another
chance
but
there
are
two
things
i
must
say
to
you
in
the
first
place
it
no
good
coming
here
as
a
victim
if
you
any
notion
that
you
been
unjustly
treated
get
rid
of
it
you
ca
play
fast
and
loose
with
morality
and
hope
to
go
if
society
did
take
care
of
itself
nobody
would
the
sooner
you
realise
that
the
better
falder
yes
sir
but
may
i
say
something
james
well
falder
i
had
a
lot
of
time
to
think
it
over
in
prison
he
stops
cokeson
encouraging
him
i
sure
you
did
falder
there
were
all
sorts
there
and
what
i
mean
sir
is
that
if
we
been
treated
differently
the
first
time
and
put
under
somebody
that
could
look
after
us
a
bit
and
not
put
in
prison
not
a
quarter
of
us
would
ever
have
got
there
james
shaking
his
head
i
afraid
i
very
grave
doubts
of
that
falder
falder
with
a
gleam
of
malice
yes
sir
so
i
found
james
my
good
fellow
do
forget
that
you
began
it
falder
i
never
wanted
to
do
wrong
james
perhaps
not
but
you
did
falder
with
all
the
bitterness
of
his
past
suffering
it
knocked
me
out
of
time
pulling
himself
up
that
is
i
mean
i
not
what
i
was
james
this
is
encouraging
for
us
falder
cokeson
he
putting
it
awkwardly
james
falder
throwing
over
his
caution
from
the
intensity
of
his
feeling
i
mean
it
cokeson
james
now
lay
aside
all
those
thoughts
falder
and
look
to
the
future
falder
almost
eagerly
yes
sir
but
you
do
understand
what
prison
is
it
here
it
gets
you
he
grips
his
chest
cokeson
in
a
whisper
to
james
i
told
you
he
wanted
nourishment
walter
yes
but
my
dear
fellow
that
pass
away
merciful
falder
with
his
face
twitching
i
hope
so
sir
james
much
more
gently
now
my
boy
what
you
got
to
do
is
to
put
all
the
past
behind
you
and
build
yourself
up
a
steady
reputation
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
thing
this
woman
you
were
mixed
up
with
you
must
give
us
your
word
you
know
to
have
done
with
that
there
no
chance
of
your
keeping
straight
if
going
to
begin
your
future
with
such
a
relationship
falder
looking
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
hunted
expression
but
sir
but
sir
it
the
one
thing
i
looked
forward
to
all
that
time
and
she
too
i
could
find
her
before
last
night
during
this
and
what
follows
cokeson
becomes
more
and
more
uneasy
james
this
is
painful
falder
but
you
must
see
for
yourself
that
it
impossible
for
a
firm
like
this
to
close
its
eyes
to
everything
give
us
this
proof
of
your
resolve
to
keep
straight
and
you
can
come
back
not
otherwise
falder
after
staring
at
james
suddenly
stiffens
himself
i
could
give
her
up
i
could
oh
sir
i
all
she
got
to
look
to
and
i
sure
she
all
i
got
james
i
very
sorry
falder
but
i
must
be
firm
it
for
the
benefit
of
you
both
in
the
long
run
no
good
can
come
of
this
connection
it
was
the
cause
of
all
your
disaster
falder
but
sir
it
gone
through
all
broken
up
my
nerves
are
in
an
awful
state
for
nothing
i
did
it
for
her
james
come
if
she
anything
of
a
woman
she
see
it
for
herself
she
wo
want
to
drag
you
down
further
if
there
were
a
prospect
of
your
being
able
to
marry
her
it
might
be
another
thing
falder
it
not
my
fault
sir
that
she
could
get
rid
of
him
she
would
have
if
she
could
that
been
the
whole
trouble
from
the
beginning
looking
suddenly
at
walter
if
anybody
would
help
her
it
only
money
wants
now
i
sure
cokeson
breaking
in
as
walter
hesitates
and
is
about
to
speak
i
do
think
we
need
consider
that
it
rather
falder
to
walter
appealing
he
must
have
given
her
full
cause
since
she
could
prove
that
he
drove
her
to
leave
him
walter
i
inclined
to
do
what
you
say
falder
if
it
can
be
managed
falder
oh
sir
he
goes
to
the
window
and
looks
down
into
the
street
cokeson
hurriedly
you
do
take
me
walter
i
have
my
reasons
falder
from
the
window
she
down
there
sir
will
you
see
her
i
can
beckon
to
her
from
here
walter
hesitates
and
looks
from
cokeson
to
james
james
with
a
sharp
nod
yes
let
her
come
falder
beckons
from
the
window
cokeson
in
a
low
fluster
to
james
and
walter
no
james
she
not
been
quite
what
she
ought
to
ha
been
while
this
young
man
been
away
she
lost
her
chance
we
ca
consult
how
to
swindle
the
law
falder
has
come
from
the
window
the
three
men
look
at
him
in
a
sort
of
awed
silence
falder
with
instinctive
apprehension
of
some
change
looking
from
one
to
the
other
there
been
nothing
between
us
sir
to
prevent
it
what
i
said
at
the
trial
was
true
and
last
night
we
only
just
sat
in
the
park
sweedle
comes
in
from
the
outer
office
cokeson
what
is
it
sweedle
honeywill
there
is
silence
james
show
her
in
ruth
comes
slowly
in
and
stands
stoically
with
falder
on
one
side
and
the
three
men
on
the
other
no
one
speaks
cokeson
turns
to
his
table
bending
over
his
papers
as
though
the
burden
of
the
situation
were
forcing
him
back
into
his
accustomed
groove
james
sharply
shut
the
door
there
sweedle
shuts
the
door
we
asked
you
to
come
up
because
there
are
certain
facts
to
be
faced
in
this
matter
i
understand
you
have
only
just
met
falder
again
ruth
yes
only
yesterday
james
he
told
us
about
himself
and
we
very
sorry
for
him
i
promised
to
take
him
back
here
if
he
make
a
fresh
start
looking
steadily
at
ruth
this
is
a
matter
that
requires
courage
ruth
who
is
looking
at
falder
begins
to
twist
her
hands
in
front
of
her
as
though
prescient
of
disaster
falder
walter
how
is
good
enough
to
say
that
he
help
us
to
get
you
a
divorce
ruth
flashes
a
startled
glance
at
james
and
walter
james
i
do
think
that
practicable
falder
falder
but
sir
james
steadily
now
honeywill
you
fond
of
him
ruth
yes
sir
i
love
him
she

starts
at
ruth

and

and
quiver
as
the
truth
dawns
on

one
out
there
to

in

better
by

for
a
minute
he
points
to
the
clerks
room
and
moves
towards
the
outer
office
falder
does
not
move
ruth
puts
out
her
hand
timidly
he
shrinks
back
from
the
touch
she
turns
and
goes
miserably
into
the
clerks
room
with
a
brusque
movement
he
follows
seizing
her
by
the
shoulder
just
inside
the
doorway
cokeson
shuts
the
door
james
pointing
to
the
outer
office
get
rid
of
that
whoever
it
is
sweedle
opening
the
office
door
in
a
scared
voice
blister
the
detective
enters
and
closes
the
door
behind
him
wister
sorry
to
disturb
you
sir
a
clerk
you
had
here
two
years
and
a
half
ago
i
arrested
him
in
this
room
james
what
about
him
wister
i
thought
perhaps
i
might
get
his
whereabouts
from
you
there
is
an
awkward
silence
cokeson
pleasantly
coming
to
the
rescue
we
not
responsible
for
his
movements
you
know
that
james
what
do
you
want
with
him
wister
he
failed
to
report
himself

last
four
weeks
walter
how
mean
wister
wo
be
up
for
another
six
months
sir
walter
has
he
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
police
till
then
wister
we
bound
to
know
where
he
sleeps
every
night
i
dare
say
we
should
interfere
sir
even
though
he
has
reported
himself
but
we
just
heard
there
a
serious
matter
of
obtaining
employment
with
a
forged
reference
what
with
the
two
things
together
we
must
have
him
again
there
is
silence
walter
and
cokeson
steal
glances
at
james
who
stands
staring
steadily
at
the
detective
cokeson
expansively
we
very
busy
at
the
moment
if
you
could
make
it
convenient
to
call
again
we
might
be
able
to
tell
you
then
james
decisively
i
a
servant
of
the
law
but
i
dislike
peaching
in
fact
i
ca
do
such
a
thing
if
you
want
him
you
must
find
him
without
us
as
he
speaks
his
eye
falls
on
falder
cap
still
lying
on
the
table
and
his
face
contracts
wister
noting
the
gesture
quietly
very
good
sir
i
ought
to
warn
you
that
having
broken
the
terms
of
his
licence
he
still
a
convict
and
sheltering
a
convict
james
i
shelter
no
one
but
you
must
come
here
and
ask
questions
which
it
not
my
business
to
answer
wister
dryly
i
wo
trouble
you
further
then
gentlemen
cokeson
i
sorry

could
give
you
the
information

quite
understand
do
you
wister
turns
to
go
but
instead
of
going
to
the
door
of
the
outer
office
he
goes
to
the
door
of
the
clerks
room
cokeson
the
other
door
the
other
door
wister
opens
the
clerks
door
ruths
voice
is
heard
oh

and
falder
i
ca
there
is
a
little
pause
then
with
sharp
fright
ruth
says
who
that
wister
has
gone
in
the
three
men
look
aghast
at
the
door
wister
from
within
keep
back
please
he
comes
swiftly
out
with
his
arm
twisted
in
falder
the
latter
gives
a
white
staring
look
at
the
three
men
walter
let
him
go
this
time
for
god
sake
wister
i
could
take
the
responsibility
sir
falder
with
a
queer
desperate
laugh
good
flinging
a
look
back
at
ruth
he
throws
up
his
head
and
goes
out
through
the
outer
office
half
dragging
wister
after
him
walter
with
despair
that
finishes
him
it
go
on
for
ever
now
sweedle
can
be
seen
staring
through
the
outer
door
there
are
sounds
of
footsteps
descending
the
stone
stairs
suddenly
a
dull
thud
a
faint
my
god
in
wister
voice
james
what
that
sweedle
dashes
forward
the
door
swings
to
behind
him
there
is
dead
silence
walter
starting
forward
to
the
inner
room
the
fainting
he
and
cokeson
support
the
fainting
ruth
from
the
doorway
of
the
clerks
room
cokeson
distracted
here
my
dear
there
there
walter
have
you
any
brandy
cokeson
i
got
sherry
walter
get
it
then
quick
he
places
ruth
in
a
chair
which
james
has
dragged
forward
cokeson
with
sherry
here
it
good
strong
sherry
they
try
to
force
the
sherry
between
her
lips
there
is
the
sound
of
feet
and
they
stop
to
listen
the
outer
door
is
reopened
wister
and
sweedle
are
seen
carrying
some
burden
james
hurrying
forward
what
is
it
they
lay
the
burden
doom
in
the
outer
office
out
of
sight
and
all
but
ruth
cluster
round
it
speaking
in
hushed
voices
wister
he
jumped
neck
broken
walter
good
god
wister
he
must
have
been
mad
to
think
he
could
give
me
the
slip
like
that
and
what
was
it
just
a
few
months
walter
bitterly
was
that
all
james
what
a
desperate
thing
then
in
a
voice
unlike
his
own
run
for
a
doctor
you
sweedle
rushes
from
the
outer
office
an
ambulance
wister
goes
out
on
ruth
face
an
expression
of
fear
and
horror
has
been
seen
growing
as
if
she
dared
not
turn
towards
the
voices
she
now
rises
and
steals
towards
them
walter
turning
suddenly
look
the
three
men
shrink
back
out
of
her
way
one
by
one
into
cokeson
room
ruth
drops
on
her
knees
by
the
body
ruth
in
a
whisper
what
is
it
he
not
breathing
she
crouches
over
him
my
dear
my
pretty
in
the
outer
office
doorway
the
figures
of
men
am
seen
standing
ruth
leaping
to
her
feet
no
no
no
no
he
dead
the
figures
of
the
men
shrink
back
cokeson
stealing
forward
in
a
hoarse
voice
there
there
poor
dear
woman
at
the
sound
behind
her
ruth
faces
round
at
him
cokeson
no
one
touch
him
now
never
again
he
safe
with
gentle
jesus
ruth
stands
as
though
turned
to
stone
in
the
doorway
staring
at
cokeson
who
bending
humbly
before
her
holds
out
his
hand
as
one
would
to
a
