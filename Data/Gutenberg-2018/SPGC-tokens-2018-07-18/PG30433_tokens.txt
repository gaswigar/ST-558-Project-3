preface
jules
steeg
has
rendered
a
real
service
to
french
and
american
teachers
by
his
judicious
selections
from
rousseau
émile
for
the
novel
of
a
hundred
years
ago
with
its
long
disquisitions
and
digressions
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
our
patient
ancestors
is
now
distasteful
to
all
but
lovers
of
the
curious
in
books
émile
is
like
an
antique
mirror
of
brass
it
reflects
the
features
of
educational
humanity
no
less
faithfully
than
one
of
more
modern
construction
in
these
few
pages
will
be
found
the
germ
of
all
that
is
useful
in
present
systems
of
education
as
well
as
most
of
the
mistakes
of
zealots
the
eighteenth
century
translations
of
this
wonderful
book
have
for
many
readers
the
disadvantage
of
an
english
style
long
disused
it
is
hoped
that
this
attempt
at
a
new
translation
may
with
all
its
defects
have
the
one
merit
of
being
in
the
dialect
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
may
thus
reach
a
wider
circle
of
readers
introduction
jean
jacques
rousseau
book
on
education
has
had
a
powerful
influence
throughout
europe
and
even
in
the
new
world
it
was
in
its
day
a
kind
of
gospel
it
had
its
share
in
bringing
about
the
revolution
which
renovated
the
entire
aspect
of
our
country
many
of
the
reforms
so
lauded
by
it
have
since
then
been
carried
into
effect
and
at
this
day
seem
affairs
in
the
eighteenth
century
they
were
daring
they
were
mere
dreams
long
before
that
time
the
immortal
satirist
rabelais
and
after
him
michael
montaigne
had
already
divined
the
truth
had
pointed
out
serious
defects
in
education
and
the
way
to
reform
no
one
followed
out
their
suggestions
or
even
gave
them
a
hearing
routine
went
on
its
way
exercises
of
memory
the
science
that
consists
of
mere
words
pedantry
barren
and
held
fast
their
bad
eminence
the
child
was
treated
as
a
machine
or
as
a
man
in
miniature
no
account
being
taken
of
his
nature
or
of
his
real
needs
without
any
greater
solicitude
about
reasonable
method
the
hygiene
of
mind
than
about
the
hygiene
of
the
body
rousseau
who
had
educated
himself
and
very
badly
at
that
was
impressed
with
the
dangers
of
the
education
of
his
day
a
mother
having
asked
his
advice
he
took
up
the
pen
to
write
it
and
little
by
little
his
counsels
grew
into
a
book
a
large
work
a
pedagogic
romance
this
romance
when
it
appeared
in
created
a
great
noise
and
a
great
scandal
the
archbishop
of
paris
christophe
de
beaumont
saw
in
it
a
dangerous
mischievous
work
and
gave
himself
the
trouble
of
writing
a
long
encyclical
letter
in
order
to
point
out
the
book
to
the
reprobation
of
the
faithful
this
document
of
chapters
is
a
formal
refutation
of
the
theories
advanced
in
émile
the
archbishop
declares
that
the
plan
of
education
proposed
by
the
author
far
from
being
in
accordance
with
christianity
is
not
fitted
to
form
citizens
or
even
men
he
accuses
rousseau
of
irreligion
and
of
bad
faith
he
denounces
him
to
the
temporal
power
as
animated
by
a
spirit
of
insubordination
and
of
revolt
he
sums
up
by
solemnly
condemning
the
book
as
containing
an
abominable
doctrine
calculated
to
overthrow
natural
law
and
to
destroy
the
foundations
of
the
christian
religion
establishing
maxims
contrary
to
gospel
morality
having
a
tendency
to
disturb
the
peace
of
empires
to
stir
up
subjects
to
revolt
against
their
sovereign
as
containing
a
great
number
of
propositions
respectively
false
scandalous
full
of
hatred
toward
the
church
and
its
ministers
derogating
from
the
respect
due
to
holy
scripture
and
the
traditions
of
the
church
erroneous
impious
blasphemous
and
heretical
in
those
days
such
a
condemnation
was
a
serious
matter
its
consequences
to
an
author
might
be
terrible
rousseau
had
barely
time
to
flee
his
arrest
was
decreed
by
the
parliament
of
paris
and
his
book
was
burned
by
the
executioner
a
few
years
before
this
the
author
would
have
run
the
risk
of
being
burned
with
his
book
as
a
fugitive
rousseau
did
not
find
a
safe
retreat
even
in
his
own
country
he
was
obliged
to
leave
geneva
where
his
book
was
also
condemned
and
berne
where
he
had
sought
refuge
but
whence
he
was
driven
by
intolerance
he
owed
it
to
the
protection
of
lord
keith
governor
of
neufchâtel
a
principality
belonging
to
the
king
of
prussia
that
he
lived
for
some
time
in
peace
in
the
little
town
of
motiers
in
the
val
de
travera
it
was
from
this
place
that
he
replied
to
the
archbishop
of
paris
by
an
apology
a
work
in
which
he
repels
one
after
another
the
imputations
of
his
accuser
and
sets
forth
anew
with
greater
urgency
his
philosophical
and
religious
principles
this
work
written
on
a
rather
confused
plan
but
with
impassioned
eloquence
manifests
a
lofty
and
sincere
spirit
it
is
said
that
the
archbishop
was
deeply
touched
by
it
and
never
afterward
spoke
of
the
author
of
émile
without
extreme
reserve
sometimes
even
eulogizing
his
character
and
his
virtues
the
renown
of
the
book
condemned
by
so
high
an
authority
was
immense
scandal
by
attracting
public
attention
to
it
did
it
good
service
what
was
most
serious
and
most
suggestive
in
it
was
not
perhaps
seized
upon
but
the
craze
of
which
it
was
the
object
had
notwithstanding
good
results
mothers
were
won
over
and
resolved
to
nurse
their
own
infants
great
lords
began
to
learn
handicrafts
like
rousseau
imaginary
pupil
physical
exercises
came
into
fashion
the
spirit
of
innovation
was
forcing
itself
a
way
it
was
not
among
ourselves
however
that
the
theories
of
rousseau
were
most
eagerly
experimented
upon
it
was
among
foreigners
in
germany
in
switzerland
that
they
found
more
resolute
partisans
and
a
field
more
ready
to
receive
them
three
men
above
all
the
rest
are
noted
for
having
popularized
the
pedagogic
method
of
rousseau
and
for
having
been
inspired
in
their
labors
by
émile
these
were
basedow
pestalozzi
and
froebel
basedow
a
german
theologian
had
devoted
himself
entirely
to
dogmatic
controversy
until
the
reading
of
émile
had
the
effect
of
enlarging
his
mental
horizon
and
of
revealing
to
him
his
true
vocation
he
wrote
important
books
to
show
how
rousseau
method
could
be
applied
in
different
departments
of
instruction
and
founded
at
dessau
in
an
institution
to
bring
that
method
within
the
domain
of
experience
this
institution
to
which
he
gave
the
name
of
philanthropinum
was
secular
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
and
at
that
time
this
was
in
itself
a
novelty
it
was
open
to
pupils
of
every
belief
and
every
nationality
and
proposed
to
render
study
easy
pleasant
and
expeditious
to
them
by
following
the
directions
of
nature
itself
in
the
first
rank
of
his
disciples
may
be
placed
campe
who
succeeded
him
in
the
management
of
the
philanthropinum
pestalozzi
of
zürich
one
of
the
foremost
educators
of
modern
times
also
found
his
whole
life
transformed
by
the
reading
of
émile
which
awoke
in
him
the
genius
of
a
reformer
he
himself
also
in
founded
a
school
in
order
to
put
in
practice
there
his
progressive
and
professional
method
of
teaching
which
was
a
fruitful
development
of
seeds
sown
by
rousseau
in
his
book
pestalozzi
left
numerous
writings
romances
treatises
reviews
all
having
for
sole
object
the
popularization
of
his
ideas
and
processes
of
education
the
most
distinguished
among
his
disciples
and
continuators
is
froebel
the
founder
of
those
primary
schools
or
asylums
known
by
the
name
of
kindergartens
and
the
author
of
highly
esteemed
pedagogic
works
these
various
attempts
these
new
and
ingenious
processes
which
step
by
step
have
made
their
way
among
us
and
are
beginning
to
make
their
workings
felt
even
in
institutions
most
stoutly
opposed
to
progress
are
all
traceable
to
rousseau
émile
it
is
therefore
not
too
much
for
frenchmen
for
teachers
for
parents
for
every
one
in
our
country
who
is
interested
in
what
concerns
teaching
to
go
back
to
the
source
of
so
great
a
movement
it
is
true
that
émile
contains
pages
that
have
outlived
their
day
many
odd
precepts
many
false
ideas
many
disputable
and
destructive
theories
but
at
the
same
time
we
find
in
it
so
many
sagacious
observations
such
upright
counsels
suitable
even
to
modern
times
so
lofty
an
ideal
that
in
spite
of
everything
we
can
not
read
and
study
it
without
profit
there
is
no
one
who
does
not
know
the
book
by
name
and
by
reputation
but
how
many
parents
and
even
teachers
have
never
read
it
this
is
because
a
large
part
of
the
book
is
no
longer
in
accordance
with
the
actual
condition
of
things
because
its
very
plan
its
fundamental
idea
are
outside
of
the
truth
we
are
obliged
to
exercise
judgment
to
make
selections
some
of
it
must
be
taken
some
left
untouched
this
is
what
we
have
done
in
the
present
edition
we
have
not
indeed
the
presumption
to
correct
rousseau
or
to
substitute
an
expurgated
émile
for
the
authentic
émile
we
have
simply
wished
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
teachers
of
childhood
to
those
pages
of
this
book
which
have
least
grown
old
which
can
still
be
of
service
can
hasten
the
downfall
of
the
old
systems
can
emphasize
by
their
energy
and
beauty
of
language
methods
already
inaugurated
and
reforms
already
undertaken
these
methods
and
reforms
can
not
be
too
often
recommended
and
set
in
a
clear
light
we
have
desired
to
call
to
the
rescue
this
powerful
and
impassioned
writer
who
brings
to
bear
upon
every
subject
he
approaches
the
magical
attractiveness
of
his
style
there
is
absolutely
nothing
practicable
in
his
system
it
consists
in
isolating
a
child
from
the
rest
of
the
world
in
creating
expressly
for
him
a
tutor
who
is
a
phoenix
among
his
kind
in
depriving
him
of
father
mother
brothers
and
sisters
his
companions
in
study
in
surrounding
him
with
a
perpetual
charlatanism
under
the
pretext
of
following
nature
and
in
showing
him
only
through
the
veil
of
a
factitious
atmosphere
the
society
in
which
he
is
to
live
and
nevertheless
at
each
step
it
is
sound
reason
by
which
we
are
met
by
an
astonishing
paradox
this
whimsicality
is
full
of
good
sense
this
dream
overflows
with
realities
this
improbable
and
chimerical
romance
contains
the
substance
and
the
marrow
of
a
rational
and
truly
modern
treatise
on
pedagogy
sometimes
we
must
read
between
the
lines
add
what
experience
has
taught
us
since
that
day
transpose
into
an
atmosphere
of
open
democracy
these
pages
written
under
the
old
order
of
things
but
even
then
quivering
with
the
new
world
which
they
were
bringing
to
light
and
for
which
they
prepared
the
way
reading
émile
in
the
light
of
modern
prejudices
we
can
see
in
it
more
than
the
author
wittingly
put
into
it
but
not
more
than
logic
and
the
instinct
of
genius
set
down
there
to
unfold
the
powers
of
children
in
due
proportion
to
their
age
not
to
transcend
their
ability
to
arouse
in
them
the
sense
of
the
observer
and
of
the
pioneer
to
make
them
discoverers
rather
than
imitators
to
teach
them
accountability
to
themselves
and
not
slavish
dependence
upon
the
words
of
others
to
address
ourselves
more
to
the
will
than
to
custom
to
the
reason
rather
than
to
the
memory
to
substitute
for
verbal
recitations
lessons
about
things
to
lead
to
theory
by
way
of
art
to
assign
to
physical
movements
and
exercises
a
prominent
place
from
the
earliest
hours
of
life
up
to
perfect
maturity
such
are
the
principles
scattered
broadcast
in
this
book
and
forming
a
happy
counterpoise
to
the
oddities
of
which
rousseau
was
perhaps
most
proud
he
takes
the
child
in
its
cradle
almost
before
its
birth
he
desires
that
mothers
should
fulfil
the
sacred
duty
of
nursing
them
at
the
breast
if
there
must
be
a
nurse
he
knows
how
to
choose
her
how
she
ought
to
be
treated
how
she
should
be
fed
he
watches
over
the
movements
of
the
child
over
its
first
playthings
all
these
counsels
bear
the
stamp
of
good
sense
and
of
experience
or
rather
they
result
from
a
power
of
divination
singular
enough
in
a
man
who
was
not
willing
to
take
care
of
his
own
children
in
this
way
day
by
day
he
follows
up
the
physical
and
moral
development
of
the
little
being
all
whose
ideas
and
feelings
he
analyzes
whom
he
guides
with
wisdom
and
with
tact
throughout
the
mazes
of
a
life
made
up
of
convention
and
artifice
we
have
carefully
avoided
suppressing
the
fictions
of
the
gardener
and
of
the
mountebank
because
they
are
characteristic
of
his
manner
and
because
after
all
these
scenes
which
as
they
stand
are
anything
in
the
world
rather
than
real
teaching
contain
nevertheless
right
notions
and
opinions
which
may
suggest
to
intelligent
teachers
processes
in
prudent
education
such
teachers
will
not
copy
the
form
they
will
not
imitate
the
awkward
but
yielding
to
the
inspiration
of
the
dominant
idea
they
will
in
a
way
more
in
accordance
with
nature
manage
to
thrill
with
life
the
teaching
of
facts
and
will
aid
the
mind
in
giving
birth
to
its
ideas
this
is
the
old
method
of
socrates
the
eternal
method
of
reason
the
only
method
which
really
educates
we
have
brought
this
volume
to
an
end
with
the
third
book
of
émile
the
fourth
and
fifth
books
which
follow
are
not
within
the
domain
of
pedagogy
they
contain
admirable
pages
which
ought
to
be
read
which
occupy
one
of
the
foremost
places
in
our
literature
which
deal
with
philosophy
with
ethics
with
theology
but
they
concern
themselves
with
the
manner
of
directing
young
men
and
women
and
no
longer
with
childhood
the
author
conducts
his
émile
even
as
far
as
to
his
betrothal
he
devotes
an
entire
book
to
the
betrothed
herself
sophie
and
closes
his
volume
only
after
he
has
united
them
in
marriage
we
will
not
go
so
far
we
will
leave
émile
upon
the
confines
of
youth
at
the
time
when
he
escapes
from
school
and
when
he
is
about
beginning
to
feel
that
he
is
a
man
at
this
difficult
and
critical
period
the
teacher
no
longer
suffices
then
above
all
things
is
needed
all
the
influence
of
the
family
the
father
example
the
tenderness
worthy
friendships
an
environment
of
meritorious
people
of
upright
minds
animated
by
lofty
ideas
who
attract
within
their
orbit
this
ardent
and
inquisitive
being
eager
for
novelty
for
action
and
for
independence
artifices
and
stratagems
are
then
no
longer
good
for
anything
they
are
very
soon
laid
open
to
the
light
all
that
can
be
required
of
a
teacher
is
that
he
shall
have
furnished
his
pupils
with
a
sound
and
strong
education
drawn
from
the
sources
of
reason
experience
and
nature
that
he
shall
have
prepared
them
to
learn
to
form
judgments
to
make
use
of
their
faculties
to
enter
valiantly
upon
study
and
upon
life
it
seems
to
us
that
the
pages
of
rousseau
here
published
may
be
a
useful
guide
in
the
pursuit
of
such
a
result
jules
steeg
book
first
the
first
book
after
some
general
remarks
upon
education
treats
especially
of
early
infancy
of
the
first
years
of
life
of
the
care
to
be
bestowed
upon
very
young
children
of
the
nursing
of
them
of
the
laws
of
health
he
makes
education
begin
at
birth
expresses
himself
on
the
subject
of
the
habits
to
be
given
or
to
be
avoided
discusses
the
use
and
meaning
of
tears
outcries
gestures
also
the
language
that
should
be
used
with
young
children
so
that
from
their
tenderest
years
the
inculcating
of
false
ideas
and
the
giving
a
wrong
bent
of
mind
may
be
avoided
general
remarks
the
object
of
education
coming
from
the
hand
of
the
author
of
all
things
everything
is
good
in
the
hands
of
man
everything
degenerates
man
obliges
one
soil
to
nourish
the
productions
of
another
one
tree
to
bear
the
fruits
of
another
he
mingles
and
confounds
climates
elements
seasons
he
mutilates
his
dog
his
horse
his
slave
he
overturns
everything
disfigures
everything
he
loves
deformity
monsters
he
desires
that
nothing
should
be
as
nature
made
it
not
even
man
himself
to
please
him
man
must
be
broken
in
like
a
horse
man
must
be
adapted
to
own
fashion
like
a
tree
in
his
garden
were
it
not
for
all
this
matters
would
be
still
worse
no
one
wishes
to
be
a
being
and
in
the
present
condition
of
things
a
man
left
to
himself
among
others
from
his
birth
would
be
the
most
deformed
among
them
all
prejudices
authority
necessities
example
all
the
social
institutions
in
which
we
are
submerged
would
stifle
nature
in
him
and
would
put
nothing
in
its
place
in
such
a
man
nature
would
be
like
a
shrub
sprung
up
by
chance
in
the
midst
of
a
highway
and
jostled
from
all
sides
bent
in
every
direction
by
the
plants
are
improved
by
cultivation
and
men
by
education
if
man
were
born
large
and
strong
his
size
and
strength
would
be
useless
to
him
until
he
had
learned
to
use
them
they
would
be
prejudicial
to
him
by
preventing
others
from
thinking
of
assisting
him
and
left
to
himself
he
would
die
of
wretchedness
before
he
had
known
his
own
necessities
we
pity
the
state
of
infancy
we
do
not
perceive
that
the
human
race
would
have
perished
if
man
had
not
begun
by
being
a
child
we
are
born
weak
we
need
strength
we
are
born
destitute
of
all
things
we
need
assistance
we
are
born
stupid
we
need
judgment
all
that
we
have
not
at
our
birth
and
that
we
need
when
grown
up
is
given
us
by
education
this
education
comes
to
us
from
nature
itself
or
from
other
men
or
from
circumstances
the
internal
development
of
our
faculties
and
of
our
organs
is
the
education
nature
gives
us
the
use
we
are
taught
to
make
of
this
development
is
the
education
we
get
from
other
men
and
what
we
learn
by
our
own
experience
about
things
that
interest
as
is
the
education
of
circumstances
each
of
us
is
therefore
formed
by
three
kinds
of
teachers
the
pupil
in
whom
their
different
lessons
contradict
one
another
is
badly
educated
and
will
never
be
in
harmony
with
himself
the
one
in
whom
they
all
touch
upon
the
same
points
and
tend
toward
the
same
object
advances
toward
that
goal
only
and
lives
accordingly
he
alone
is
well
educated
now
of
these
three
different
educations
that
of
nature
does
not
depend
upon
us
that
of
circumstances
depends
upon
us
only
in
certain
respects
that
of
men
is
the
only
one
of
which
we
are
really
masters
and
that
solely
because
we
think
we
are
for
who
can
hope
to
direct
entirely
the
speech
and
conduct
of
all
who
surround
a
child
as
soon
therefore
as
education
becomes
an
art
its
success
is
almost
impossible
since
the
agreement
of
circumstances
necessary
to
this
success
is
independent
of
personal
effort
all
that
the
utmost
care
can
do
is
to
approach
more
or
less
nearly
our
object
but
for
attaining
it
special
good
fortune
is
needed
what
is
this
object
that
of
nature
itself
as
has
just
been
proved
since
the
agreement
of
the
three
educations
is
necessary
to
their
perfection
it
is
toward
the
one
for
which
we
ourselves
can
do
nothing
that
we
must
direct
both
the
others
but
perhaps
this
word
nature
has
too
vague
a
meaning
we
must
here
try
to
define
it
in
the
natural
order
of
things
all
men
being
equal
the
vocation
common
to
all
is
the
state
of
manhood
and
whoever
is
well
trained
for
that
can
not
fulfil
badly
any
vocation
which
depends
upon
it
whether
my
pupil
be
destined
for
the
army
the
church
or
the
bar
matters
little
to
me
before
he
can
think
of
adopting
the
vocation
of
his
parents
nature
calls
upon
him
to
be
a
man
how
to
live
is
the
business
i
wish
to
teach
him
on
leaving
my
hands
he
will
not
i
admit
be
a
magistrate
a
soldier
or
a
priest
first
of
all
he
will
be
a
man
all
that
a
man
ought
to
be
he
can
be
at
need
as
well
as
any
one
else
can
fortune
will
in
vain
alter
his
position
for
he
will
always
occupy
his
own
our
real
study
is
that
of
the
state
of
man
he
among
us
who
best
knows
how
to
bear
the
good
and
evil
fortunes
of
this
life
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
educated
whence
it
follows
that
true
education
consists
less
in
precept
than
in
practice
we
begin
to
instruct
ourselves
when
we
begin
to
live
our
education
commences
with
the
commencement
of
our
life
our
first
teacher
is
our
nurse
for
this
reason
the
word
education
had
among
the
ancients
another
meaning
which
we
no
longer
attach
to
it
it
signified
nutriment
we
must
then
take
a
broader
view
of
things
and
consider
in
our
pupil
man
in
the
abstract
man
exposed
to
all
the
accidents
of
human
life
if
man
were
born
attached
to
the
soil
of
a
country
if
the
same
season
continued
throughout
the
year
if
every
one
held
his
fortune
by
such
a
tenure
that
he
could
never
change
it
the
established
customs
of
would
be
in
certain
respects
good
the
child
educated
for
his
position
and
never
leaving
it
could
not
be
exposed
to
the
inconveniences
of
another
but
seeing
that
human
affairs
are
changeable
seeing
the
restless
and
disturbing
spirit
of
this
century
which
overturns
everything
once
in
a
generation
can
a
more
senseless
method
be
imagined
than
to
educate
a
child
as
if
he
were
never
to
leave
his
room
as
if
he
were
obliged
to
be
constantly
surrounded
by
his
servants
if
the
poor
creature
takes
but
one
step
on
the
earth
if
he
comes
down
so
much
as
one
stair
he
is
ruined
this
is
not
teaching
him
to
endure
pain
it
is
training
him
to
feel
it
more
keenly
we
think
only
of
preserving
the
child
this
is
not
enough
we
ought
to
teach
him
to
preserve
himself
when
he
is
a
man
to
bear
the
blows
of
fate
to
brave
both
wealth
and
wretchedness
to
live
if
need
be
among
the
snows
of
iceland
or
upon
the
burning
rock
of
malta
in
vain
you
take
precautions
against
his
dying
he
must
die
after
all
and
if
his
death
be
not
indeed
the
result
of
those
very
precautions
they
are
none
the
less
mistaken
it
is
less
important
to
keep
him
from
dying
than
it
is
to
teach
him
how
to
live
to
live
is
not
merely
to
breathe
it
is
to
act
it
is
to
make
use
of
our
organs
of
our
senses
of
our
faculties
of
all
the
powers
which
bear
witness
to
us
of
our
own
existence
he
who
has
lived
most
is
not
he
who
has
numbered
the
most
years
but
he
who
has
been
most
truly
conscious
of
what
life
is
a
man
may
have
himself
buried
at
the
age
of
a
hundred
years
who
died
from
the
hour
of
his
birth
he
would
have
gained
something
by
going
to
his
grave
in
youth
if
up
to
that
time
he
had
only
lived
the
child
the
child
needs
to
stretch
and
to
move
his
limbs
so
as
to
draw
them
out
of
the
torpor
in
which
rolled
into
a
ball
they
have
so
long
remained
we
do
stretch
his
limbs
it
is
true
but
we
prevent
him
from
moving
them
we
even
constrain
his
head
into
a
baby
cap
it
seems
as
if
we
were
afraid
he
might
appear
to
be
alive
the
inaction
the
constraint
in
which
we
keep
his
limbs
can
not
fail
to
interfere
with
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
of
the
secretions
to
prevent
the
child
from
growing
strong
and
sturdy
and
to
change
his
constitution
in
regions
where
these
extravagant
precautions
are
not
taken
the
men
are
all
large
strong
and
well
proportioned
countries
in
which
children
are
swaddled
swarm
with
hunchbacks
with
cripples
with
persons
stunted
rickety
deformed
in
all
kinds
of
ways
for
fear
that
the
bodies
of
children
may
be
deformed
by
free
movements
we
hasten
to
deform
them
by
putting
them
into
a
press
of
our
own
accord
we
cripple
them
to
prevent
their
laming
themselves
must
not
such
a
cruel
constraint
have
an
influence
upon
their
temper
as
well
as
upon
their
constitution
their
first
feeling
is
a
feeling
of
constraint
and
of
suffering
to
all
their
necessary
movements
they
find
only
obstacles
more
unfortunate
than
chained
criminals
they
make
fruitless
efforts
they
fret
themselves
they
cry
do
you
tell
me
that
the
first
sounds
they
make
are
cries
i
can
well
believe
it
you
thwart
them
from
the
time
they
are
born
the
first
gifts
they
receive
from
you
are
chains
the
first
treatment
they
undergo
is
torment
having
nothing
free
but
the
voice
why
should
they
not
use
it
in
complaints
they
cry
on
account
of
the
suffering
you
cause
them
if
you
were
pinioned
in
the
same
way
your
own
cries
would
be
louder
whence
arises
this
unreasonable
custom
of
swaddling
children
from
an
unnatural
custom
since
the
time
when
mothers
despising
their
first
duty
no
longer
wish
to
nurse
their
own
children
at
the
breast
it
has
been
necessary
to
intrust
the
little
ones
to
hired
women
these
finding
themselves
in
this
way
the
mothers
of
strange
children
concerning
whom
the
voice
of
nature
is
silent
to
them
seek
only
to
spare
themselves
annoyance
a
child
at
liberty
would
require
incessant
watching
but
after
he
is
well
swaddled
they
throw
him
into
a
corner
without
troubling
themselves
at
all
on
account
of
his
cries
provided
there
are
no
proofs
of
the
nurse
carelessness
provided
that
the
nursling
does
not
break
his
legs
or
his
arms
what
does
it
matter
after
all
that
he
is
pining
away
or
that
he
continues
feeble
for
the
rest
of
his
life
his
limbs
are
preserved
at
the
expense
of
his
life
and
whatever
happens
the
nurse
is
held
free
from
blame
it
is
pretended
that
children
when
left
free
may
put
themselves
into
bad
positions
and
make
movements
liable
to
injure
the
proper
conformation
of
their
limbs
this
is
one
of
the
weak
arguments
of
our
false
wisdom
which
no
experience
has
ever
confirmed
of
that
multitude
of
children
who
among
nations
more
sensible
than
ourselves
are
brought
up
in
the
full
freedom
of
their
limbs
not
one
is
seen
to
wound
or
lame
himself
they
can
not
give
their
movements
force
enough
to
make
them
dangerous
and
when
they
assume
a
hurtful
position
pain
soon
warns
them
to
change
it
we
have
not
yet
brought
ourselves
to
the
point
of
swaddling
puppies
or
kittens
do
we
see
that
any
inconvenience
results
to
them
from
this
negligence
children
are
heavier
indeed
but
in
proportion
they
are
weaker
they
can
scarcely
move
themselves
at
all
how
can
they
lame
themselves
if
laid
upon
the
back
they
would
die
in
that
position
like
the
tortoise
without
being
able
ever
to
turn
themselves
again
this
want
of
intelligence
in
the
care
bestowed
upon
young
children
is
seen
particularly
in
those
mothers
who
give
themselves
no
concern
about
their
own
do
not
themselves
nurse
them
intrust
them
to
hireling
nurses
this
custom
is
fatal
to
all
first
to
the
children
and
finally
to
families
where
barrenness
becomes
the
rule
where
woman
sacrifices
to
her
own
convenience
the
joys
and
the
duties
of
motherhood
would
you
recall
every
one
to
his
highest
duties
begin
with
the
mothers
you
will
be
astonished
at
the
changes
you
will
effect
from
this
first
depravity
all
others
come
in
succession
the
entire
moral
order
is
changed
natural
feeling
is
extinguished
in
all
hearts
within
our
homes
there
is
less
cheerfulness
the
touching
sight
of
a
growing
family
no
longer
attaches
the
husband
or
attracts
the
attention
of
strangers
the
mother
whose
children
are
not
seen
is
less
respected
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
family
living
together
habit
no
longer
strengthens
the
ties
of
blood
there
are
no
longer
fathers
and
mothers
and
children
and
brothers
and
sisters
they
all
scarcely
know
one
another
how
then
should
they
love
one
another
each
one
thinks
only
of
himself
when
home
is
a
melancholy
lonely
place
we
must
indeed
go
elsewhere
to
enjoy
ourselves
but
let
mothers
only
vouchsafe
to
nourish
their
children
and
our
manners
will
reform
themselves
the
feelings
of
nature
will
in
all
hearts
the
state
will
be
repeopled
this
chief
thing
this
one
thing
will
bring
all
the
rest
into
order
again
the
attractions
of
home
life
present
the
best
antidote
to
bad
morals
the
bustling
life
of
little
children
considered
so
tiresome
becomes
pleasant
it
makes
the
father
and
the
mother
more
necessary
to
one
another
more
dear
to
one
another
it
draws
closer
between
them
the
conjugal
tie
when
the
family
is
sprightly
and
animated
domestic
cares
form
the
dearest
occupation
of
the
wife
and
the
sweetest
recreation
of
the
husband
thus
the
correction
of
this
one
abuse
would
soon
result
in
a
general
reform
nature
would
resume
all
her
rights
when
women
are
once
more
true
mothers
men
will
become
true
fathers
and
husbands
if
mothers
are
not
real
mothers
children
are
not
real
children
toward
them
their
duties
to
one
another
are
reciprocal
and
if
these
be
badly
fulfilled
on
the
one
side
they
will
be
neglected
on
the
other
side
the
child
ought
to
love
his
mother
before
he
knows
that
it
is
his
duty
to
love
her
if
the
voice
of
natural
affection
be
not
strengthened
by
habit
and
by
care
it
will
grow
dumb
even
in
childhood
and
thus
the
heart
dies
so
to
speak
before
it
is
born
thus
from
the
outset
we
are
beyond
the
pale
of
nature
there
is
an
opposite
way
by
which
a
woman
goes
beyond
it
that
is
when
instead
of
neglecting
a
mother
cares
she
carries
them
to
excess
when
she
makes
her
child
her
idol
she
increases
and
fosters
his
weakness
to
prevent
him
from
feeling
it
hoping
to
shelter
him
from
the
laws
of
nature
she
wards
from
him
shocks
of
pain
she
does
not
consider
how
for
the
sake
of
preserving
him
for
a
moment
from
some
inconveniences
she
is
heaping
upon
his
head
future
accidents
and
perils
nor
how
cruel
is
the
caution
which
prolongs
the
weakness
of
childhood
in
one
who
must
bear
the
fatigues
of
a
man
the
fable
says
that
to
render
her
son
invulnerable
thetis
plunged
him
into
the
styx
this
allegory
is
beautiful
and
clear
the
cruel
mothers
of
whom
i
am
speaking
do
far
otherwise
by
plunging
their
children
into
effeminacy
they
open
their
pores
to
ills
of
every
kind
to
which
when
grown
up
they
fall
a
certain
prey
watch
nature
carefully
and
follow
the
paths
she
traces
out
for
you
she
gives
children
continual
exercise
she
strengthens
their
constitution
by
ordeals
of
every
kind
she
teaches
them
early
what
pain
and
trouble
mean
the
cutting
of
their
teeth
gives
them
fever
sharp
fits
of
colic
throw
them
into
convulsions
long
coughing
chokes
them
worms
torment
them
repletion
corrupts
their
blood
different
leavens
fermenting
there
cause
dangerous
eruptions
nearly
the
whole
of
infancy
is
sickness
and
danger
half
the
children
born
into
the
world
die
before
their
eighth
year
these
trials
past
the
child
has
gained
strength
and
as
soon
as
he
can
use
life
its
principle
becomes
more
assured
this
is
the
law
of
nature
why
do
you
oppose
her
do
you
not
see
that
in
thinking
to
correct
her
you
destroy
her
work
and
counteract
the
effect
of
all
her
cares
in
your
opinion
to
do
without
what
she
is
doing
within
is
to
redouble
the
danger
on
the
contrary
it
is
really
to
avert
to
mitigate
that
danger
experience
teaches
that
more
children
who
are
delicately
reared
die
than
others
provided
we
do
not
exceed
the
measure
of
their
strength
it
is
better
to
employ
it
than
to
hoard
it
give
them
practice
then
in
the
trials
they
will
one
day
have
to
endure
inure
their
bodies
to
the
inclemencies
of
the
seasons
of
climates
of
elements
to
hunger
thirst
fatigue
plunge
them
into
the
water
of
the
styx
before
the
habits
of
the
body
are
acquired
we
can
give
it
such
as
we
please
without
risk
but
when
once
it
has
reached
its
full
vigor
any
alteration
is
perilous
to
its
a
child
will
endure
changes
which
a
man
could
not
bear
the
fibres
of
the
former
soft
and
pliable
take
without
effort
the
bent
we
give
them
those
of
man
more
hardened
do
not
without
violence
change
those
they
have
received
we
may
therefore
make
a
child
robust
without
exposing
his
life
or
his
health
and
even
if
there
were
some
risk
we
still
ought
not
to
hesitate
since
there
are
risks
inseparable
from
human
life
can
we
do
better
than
to
throw
them
back
upon
that
period
of
life
when
they
are
least
disadvantageous
a
child
becomes
more
precious
as
he
advances
in
age
to
the
value
of
his
person
is
added
that
of
the
cares
he
has
cost
us
if
we
lose
his
life
his
own
consciousness
of
death
is
added
to
our
sense
of
loss
above
all
things
then
in
watching
over
his
preservation
we
must
think
of
the
future
we
must
arm
him
against
the
misfortunes
of
youth
before
he
has
reached
them
for
if
the
value
of
life
increases
up
to
the
age
when
life
becomes
useful
what
folly
it
is
to
spare
the
child
some
troubles
and
to
heap
them
upon
the
age
of
reason
are
these
the
counsels
of
a
master
in
all
ages
suffering
is
the
lot
of
man
even
to
the
cares
of
pain
is
joined
happy
are
we
who
in
childhood
are
acquainted
with
only
physical
misfortunes
misfortunes
far
less
cruel
less
painful
than
others
misfortunes
which
far
more
rarely
make
us
renounce
life
we
do
not
kill
ourselves
on
account
of
the
pains
of
gout
seldom
do
any
but
those
of
the
mind
produce
despair
we
pity
the
lot
of
infancy
and
it
is
our
own
lot
that
we
ought
to
pity
our
greatest
misfortunes
come
to
us
from
ourselves
at
birth
a
child
cries
his
earliest
infancy
is
spent
in
crying
sometimes
he
is
tossed
he
is
petted
to
appease
him
sometimes
he
is
threatened
beaten
to
make
him
keep
quiet
we
either
do
as
he
pleases
or
else
we
exact
from
him
what
we
please
we
either
submit
to
his
whims
or
make
him
submit
to
ours
there
is
no
middle
course
he
must
either
give
or
receive
orders
thus
his
first
ideas
are
those
of
absolute
rule
and
of
slavery
before
he
knows
how
to
speak
he
commands
before
he
is
able
to
act
he
obeys
and
sometimes
he
is
punished
before
he
knows
what
his
faults
are
or
rather
before
he
is
capable
of
committing
them
thus
do
we
early
pour
into
his
young
heart
the
passions
that
are
afterward
imputed
to
nature
and
after
having
taken
pains
to
make
him
wicked
we
complain
of
finding
him
wicked
a
child
passes
six
or
seven
years
of
his
life
in
this
manner
in
the
hands
of
women
the
victim
of
his
own
caprice
and
of
theirs
after
having
made
him
learn
this
and
that
after
having
loaded
his
memory
either
with
words
he
can
not
understand
or
with
facts
which
are
of
no
use
to
him
after
having
stifled
his
natural
disposition
by
the
passions
we
have
created
we
put
this
artificial
creature
into
the
hands
of
a
tutor
who
finishes
the
development
of
the
artificial
germs
he
finds
already
formed
and
teaches
him
everything
except
to
know
himself
everything
except
to
know
how
to
live
and
how
to
make
himself
happy
finally
when
this
enslaved
child
this
little
tyrant
full
of
learning
and
devoid
of
sense
enfeebled
alike
in
mind
and
body
is
cast
upon
the
world
he
there
by
his
unfitness
by
his
pride
and
by
all
his
vices
makes
us
deplore
human
wretchedness
and
perversity
we
deceive
ourselves
this
is
the
man
our
whims
have
created
nature
makes
men
by
a
different
process
do
you
then
wish
him
to
preserve
his
original
form
preserve
it
from
the
moment
he
enters
the
world
as
soon
as
he
is
born
take
possession
of
him
and
do
not
leave
him
until
he
is
a
man
without
this
you
will
never
succeed
as
the
mother
is
the
true
nurse
the
father
is
the
true
teacher
let
them
be
of
one
mind
as
to
the
order
in
which
their
functions
are
fulfilled
as
well
as
in
regard
to
their
plan
let
the
child
pass
from
the
hands
of
the
one
into
the
hands
of
the
other
he
will
be
better
educated
by
a
father
who
is
judicious
even
though
of
moderate
attainments
than
by
the
most
skilful
master
in
the
world
for
zeal
will
supplement
talent
better
than
talent
can
supply
what
only
zeal
can
give
a
father
when
he
brings
his
children
into
existence
and
supports
them
has
in
so
doing
fulfilled
only
a
third
part
of
his
task
to
the
human
race
he
owes
men
to
society
men
fitted
for
society
to
the
state
citizens
every
man
who
can
pay
this
triple
debt
and
does
not
pay
it
is
a
guilty
man
and
if
he
pays
it
by
halves
he
is
perhaps
more
guilty
still
he
who
can
not
fulfil
the
duties
of
a
father
has
no
right
to
be
a
father
not
poverty
nor
severe
labor
nor
human
respect
can
release
him
from
the
duty
of
supporting
his
children
and
of
educating
them
himself
readers
you
may
believe
my
words
i
prophesy
to
any
one
who
has
natural
feeling
and
neglects
these
sacred
duties
that
he
will
long
shed
bitter
tears
over
this
fault
and
that
for
those
tears
he
will
find
no
consolation
it
being
supposed
that
the
father
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
charge
himself
personally
with
the
education
of
his
son
he
must
charge
a
third
person
with
it
must
seek
out
a
master
a
teacher
for
the
child
the
qualifications
of
a
good
tutor
are
very
freely
discussed
the
first
qualification
i
should
require
in
him
and
this
one
presupposes
many
others
is
that
he
shall
not
be
capable
of
selling
himself
there
are
employments
so
noble
that
we
can
not
fulfil
them
for
money
without
showing
ourselves
unworthy
to
fulfil
them
such
an
employment
is
that
of
a
soldier
such
a
one
is
that
of
a
teacher
who
then
shall
educate
my
child
i
have
told
you
already
yourself
i
can
not
then
make
for
yourself
a
friend
who
can
i
see
no
other
alternative
a
teacher
what
a
great
soul
he
ought
to
be
truly
to
form
a
man
one
must
be
either
himself
a
father
or
else
something
more
than
human
and
this
is
the
office
you
calmly
entrust
to
hirelings
the
earliest
education
children
first
impressions
are
purely
those
of
feeling
they
perceive
only
pleasure
and
pain
unable
either
to
move
about
or
to
grasp
anything
with
their
hands
they
need
a
great
deal
of
time
to
form
sensations
which
represent
and
so
make
them
aware
of
objects
outside
of
themselves
but
during
all
this
time
while
these
objects
are
extending
and
as
it
were
receding
from
their
eyes
assuming
to
them
form
and
dimension
the
constantly
recurring
sensations
begin
to
subject
the
little
creatures
to
the
sway
of
habit
we
see
their
eyes
incessantly
turning
toward
the
light
and
if
it
comes
to
them
from
one
side
unwittingly
taking
the
direction
of
that
side
so
that
their
faces
ought
to
be
carefully
turned
toward
the
light
lest
they
become
or
accustom
themselves
to
look
awry
they
should
also
early
accustom
themselves
to
darkness
or
else
they
will
cry
and
scream
as
soon
as
they
are
left
in
the
dark
food
and
sleep
if
too
exactly
proportioned
become
necessary
to
them
after
the
lapse
of
the
same
intervals
and
soon
the
desire
arises
not
from
necessity
but
from
habit
or
rather
habit
adds
a
new
want
to
those
of
nature
and
this
must
be
prevented
the
only
habit
a
child
should
be
allowed
to
form
is
to
contract
no
habits
whatever
let
him
not
be
carried
upon
one
arm
more
than
upon
another
let
him
not
be
accustomed
to
put
forth
one
hand
rather
than
the
other
or
to
use
it
oftener
nor
to
desire
to
eat
to
sleep
to
act
in
any
way
at
regular
hours
nor
to
be
unable
to
stay
alone
either
by
night
or
by
day
prepare
long
beforehand
for
the
time
when
he
shall
freely
use
all
his
strength
do
this
by
leaving
his
body
under
the
control
of
its
natural
bent
by
fitting
him
to
be
always
master
of
himself
and
to
carry
out
his
own
will
in
everything
as
soon
as
he
has
a
will
of
his
own
since
the
only
kinds
of
objects
presented
to
him
are
likely
to
make
him
either
timid
or
courageous
why
should
not
his
education
begin
before
he
speaks
or
understands
i
would
habituate
him
to
seeing
new
objects
though
they
be
ugly
repulsive
or
singular
but
let
this
be
by
degrees
and
from
a
distance
until
he
has
become
accustomed
to
them
and
from
seeing
them
handled
by
others
shall
at
last
handle
them
himself
if
during
his
infancy
he
has
seen
without
fear
frogs
serpents
crawfishes
he
will
when
grown
up
see
without
shrinking
any
animal
that
may
be
shown
him
for
one
who
daily
sees
frightful
objects
there
are
none
such
all
children
are
afraid
of
masks
i
begin
by
showing
émile
the
mask
of
a
pleasant
face
by
and
by
some
one
puts
the
mask
upon
his
own
face
so
that
the
child
can
see
it
i
begin
to
laugh
every
one
else
laughs
and
the
child
with
the
rest
by
degrees
i
familiarize
him
with
less
comely
masks
and
finally
with
really
hideous
ones
if
i
have
managed
the
process
well
he
will
far
from
being
frightened
at
the
last
mask
laugh
at
it
as
he
laughed
at
the
first
after
that
i
shall
not
fear
his
being
frightened
by
any
one
with
a
mask
when
in
the
farewell
scene
between
hector
and
andromache
the
little
astyanax
terrified
at
the
plume
floating
from
a
helmet
fails
to
recognize
his
father
throws
himself
crying
upon
his
nurse
breast
and
wins
from
his
mother
a
smile
bright
with
tears
what
ought
to
be
done
to
soothe
his
fear
precisely
what
hector
does
he
places
the
helmet
on
the
ground
and
then
caresses
his
child
at
a
more
tranquil
moment
this
should
not
have
been
all
they
should
have
drawn
near
the
helmet
played
with
its
plumes
caused
the
child
to
handle
them
at
last
the
nurse
should
have
lifted
the
helmet
and
laughingly
set
it
on
her
own
head
if
indeed
the
hand
of
a
woman
dared
touch
the
armor
of
hector
if
i
wish
to
familiarize
émile
with
the
noise
of
i
first
burn
some
powder
in
a
pistol
the
quickly
vanishing
flame
the
new
kind
of
lightning
greatly
pleases
him
i
repeat
the
process
using
more
powder
by
degrees
i
put
into
the
pistol
a
small
charge
without
ramming
it
down
then
a
larger
charge
finally
i
accustom
him
to
the
noise
of
a
gun
to
bombs
to
to
the
most
terrific
noises
i
have
noticed
that
children
are
rarely
afraid
of
thunder
unless
indeed
the
are
so
frightful
as
actually
to
wound
the
organ
of
hearing
otherwise
they
fear
it
only
when
they
have
been
taught
that
thunder
sometimes
wounds
or
kills
when
reason
begins
to
affright
them
let
habit
reassure
them
by
a
slow
and
well
conducted
process
the
man
or
the
child
is
rendered
fearless
of
everything
in
this
outset
of
life
while
memory
and
imagination
are
still
inactive
the
child
pays
attention
only
to
what
actually
affects
his
senses
the
first
materials
of
his
knowledge
are
his
sensations
if
therefore
these
are
presented
to
him
in
suitable
order
his
memory
can
hereafter
present
them
to
his
understanding
in
the
same
order
but
as
he
attends
to
his
sensations
only
it
will
at
first
suffice
to
show
him
very
clearly
the
connection
between
these
sensations
and
the
objects
which
give
rise
to
them
he
is
eager
to
touch
everything
to
handle
everything
do
not
thwart
this
restless
desire
it
suggests
to
him
a
very
necessary
apprenticeship
it
is
thus
he
learns
to
feel
the
heat
and
coldness
hardness
and
softness
heaviness
and
lightness
of
bodies
to
judge
of
their
size
their
shape
and
all
their
sensible
qualities
by
looking
by
touching
by
listening
above
all
by
comparing
the
results
of
sight
with
those
of
touch
estimating
with
the
eye
the
sensation
a
thing
produces
upon
the
fingers
by
movement
alone
we
learn
the
existence
of
things
which
are
not
ourselves
and
it
is
by
our
own
movements
alone
that
we
gain
the
idea
of
extension
because
the
child
has
not
this
idea
he
stretches
out
his
hand
indifferently
to
seize
an
object
which
touches
him
or
one
which
is
a
hundred
paces
distant
from
him
the
effort
he
makes
in
doing
this
appears
to
you
a
sign
of
domination
an
order
he
gives
the
object
to
come
nearer
or
to
you
to
bring
it
to
him
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
it
means
only
that
the
object
seen
first
within
the
brain
then
upon
the
eye
is
now
seen
at
arm
length
and
that
he
does
not
conceive
of
any
distance
beyond
his
reach
be
careful
then
to
walk
often
with
him
to
transport
him
from
one
place
to
another
to
let
him
feel
the
change
of
position
and
in
this
way
to
teach
him
how
to
judge
of
distances
when
he
begins
to
know
them
change
the
plan
carry
him
only
where
it
is
convenient
for
you
to
do
so
and
not
wherever
it
pleases
him
for
as
soon
as
he
is
no
longer
deceived
by
the
senses
his
attempts
arise
from
another
cause
this
change
is
remarkable
and
demands
explanation
the
uneasiness
arising
from
our
wants
expresses
itself
by
signs
whenever
help
in
supplying
these
wants
is
needed
hence
the
cries
of
children
they
cry
a
great
deal
and
this
is
natural
since
all
their
sensations
are
those
of
feeling
children
enjoy
them
in
silence
when
the
sensations
are
pleasant
otherwise
they
express
them
in
their
own
language
and
ask
relief
now
as
long
as
children
are
awake
they
can
not
be
in
a
state
of
indifference
they
either
sleep
or
are
moved
by
pleasure
and
pain
all
our
languages
are
the
result
of
art
whether
there
is
a
natural
language
common
to
all
mankind
has
long
been
a
matter
of
investigation
without
doubt
there
is
such
a
language
and
it
is
the
one
that
children
utter
before
they
know
how
to
talk
this
language
is
not
articulate
but
it
is
accentuated
sonorous
intelligible
the
using
of
our
own
language
has
led
us
to
neglect
this
even
so
far
as
to
forget
it
altogether
let
us
study
children
and
we
shall
soon
acquire
it
again
from
them
nurses
are
our
teachers
in
this
language
they
understand
all
their
nurslings
say
they
answer
them
they
hold
really
connected
dialogues
with
them
and
although
they
pronounce
words
these
words
are
entirely
useless
the
child
understands
not
the
meaning
of
the
words
but
the
accent
which
accompanies
them
to
the
language
of
the
voice
is
added
the
no
less
forcible
language
of
gesture
this
gesture
is
not
that
of
children
feeble
hands
it
is
that
seen
in
their
faces
it
is
astonishing
to
see
how
much
expression
these
immature
countenances
already
have
from
moment
to
moment
their
features
change
with
inconceivable
quickness
on
them
you
see
the
smile
the
wish
the
fear
spring
into
life
and
pass
away
like
so
many
lightning
flashes
each
time
you
seem
to
see
a
different
countenance
they
certainly
have
much
more
flexible
facial
muscles
than
ours
on
the
other
hand
their
dull
eyes
tell
us
almost
nothing
at
all
such
is
naturally
the
character
of
their
expression
when
all
their
wants
are
physical
sensations
are
made
known
by
grimaces
sentiments
by
looks
as
the
first
state
of
man
is
wretchedness
and
weakness
so
his
first
utterances
are
complaints
and
tears
the
child
feels
his
need
and
can
not
satisfy
it
he
implores
aid
from
others
by
crying
if
he
is
hungry
or
thirsty
he
cries
if
he
is
too
cold
or
too
warm
he
cries
if
he
wishes
to
move
or
to
be
kept
at
rest
he
cries
if
he
wishes
to
sleep
or
to
be
moved
about
he
cries
the
less
control
he
has
of
his
own
mode
of
living
the
oftener
he
asks
those
about
him
to
change
it
he
has
but
one
language
because
he
feels
so
to
speak
but
one
sort
of
discomfort
in
the
imperfect
condition
of
his
organs
he
does
not
distinguish
their
different
impressions
all
ills
produce
in
him
only
a
sensation
of
pain
from
this
crying
regarded
as
so
little
worthy
of
attention
arises
the
first
relation
of
man
to
all
that
surrounds
him
just
here
is
forged
the
first
link
of
that
long
chain
which
constitutes
social
order
when
the
child
cries
he
is
ill
at
ease
he
has
some
want
that
he
can
not
satisfy
we
examine
into
it
we
search
for
the
want
find
it
and
relieve
it
when
we
can
not
find
it
or
relieve
it
the
crying
continues
we
are
annoyed
by
it
we
caress
the
child
to
make
him
keep
quiet
we
rock
him
and
sing
to
him
to
lull
him
asleep
if
he
persists
we
grow
impatient
we
threaten
him
brutal
nurses
sometimes
strike
him
these
are
strange
lessons
for
him
upon
his
entrance
into
life
the
first
crying
of
children
is
a
prayer
if
we
do
not
heed
it
well
this
crying
soon
becomes
a
command
they
begin
by
asking
our
aid
they
end
by
compelling
us
to
serve
them
thus
from
their
very
weakness
whence
comes
at
first
their
feeling
of
dependence
springs
afterward
the
idea
of
empire
and
of
commanding
others
but
as
this
idea
is
awakened
less
by
their
own
wants
than
by
the
fact
that
we
are
serving
them
those
moral
results
whose
immediate
cause
is
not
in
nature
are
here
perceived
we
therefore
see
why
even
at
this
early
age
it
is
important
to
discern
the
hidden
purpose
which
dictates
the
gesture
or
the
cry
when
the
child
stretches
forth
his
hand
with
an
effort
but
without
a
sound
he
thinks
he
can
reach
some
object
because
he
does
not
properly
estimate
its
distance
he
is
mistaken
but
if
while
stretching
out
his
hand
he
complains
and
cries
he
is
no
longer
deceived
as
to
the
distance
he
is
commanding
the
object
to
come
to
him
or
is
directing
you
to
bring
it
to
him
in
the
first
case
carry
him
to
the
object
slowly
and
with
short
steps
in
the
second
case
do
not
even
appear
to
understand
him
it
is
worth
while
to
habituate
him
early
not
to
command
people
for
he
is
not
their
master
nor
things
for
they
can
not
understand
him
so
when
a
child
wants
something
he
sees
and
we
mean
to
give
it
to
him
it
is
better
to
carry
him
to
the
object
than
to
fetch
the
object
to
him
from
this
practice
of
ours
he
will
learn
a
lesson
suited
to
his
age
and
there
is
no
better
way
of
suggesting
this
lesson
to
him
maxims
to
keep
us
true
to
nature
reason
alone
teaches
us
to
know
good
and
evil
conscience
which
makes
us
love
the
one
and
hate
the
other
is
independent
of
reason
but
can
not
grow
strong
without
its
aid
before
reaching
years
of
reason
we
do
good
and
evil
unconsciously
there
is
no
moral
character
in
our
actions
although
there
sometimes
is
in
our
feeling
toward
those
actions
of
others
which
relate
to
us
a
child
likes
to
disturb
everything
he
sees
he
breaks
he
shatters
everything
within
his
reach
he
lays
hold
of
a
bird
just
as
he
would
lay
hold
of
a
stone
and
strangles
it
without
knowing
what
he
is
doing
why
is
this
at
first
view
philosophy
would
account
for
it
on
the
ground
of
vices
natural
to
us
pride
the
spirit
of
domination
the
wickedness
of
mankind
it
would
perhaps
add
that
the
sense
of
his
own
weakness
makes
the
child
eager
to
do
things
requiring
strength
and
so
prove
to
himself
his
own
power
but
see
that
old
man
infirm
and
broken
down
whom
the
cycle
of
human
life
brings
back
to
the
weakness
of
childhood
not
only
does
he
remain
immovable
and
quiet
but
he
wishes
everything
about
him
to
be
in
the
same
condition
the
slightest
change
disturbs
and
disquiets
him
he
would
like
to
see
stillness
reigning
everywhere
how
could
the
same
powerlessness
joined
to
the
same
passions
produce
such
different
effects
in
the
two
ages
if
the
primary
cause
were
not
changed
and
where
can
we
seek
for
this
difference
of
cause
unless
it
be
in
the
physical
condition
of
the
two
individuals
the
active
principle
common
to
the
two
is
developing
in
the
one
and
dying
out
in
the
other
the
one
is
growing
and
the
other
is
wearing
itself
out
the
one
is
tending
toward
life
and
the
other
toward
death
failing
activity
concentrates
itself
in
the
heart
of
the
old
man
in
the
child
it
is
superabounding
and
reaches
outward
he
seems
to
feel
within
him
life
enough
to
animate
all
that
surrounds
him
whether
he
makes
or
unmakes
matters
little
to
him
it
is
enough
that
he
changes
the
condition
of
things
and
that
every
change
is
an
action
if
he
seems
more
inclined
to
destroy
things
it
is
not
out
of
perverseness
but
because
the
action
which
creates
is
always
slow
and
that
which
destroys
being
more
rapid
better
suits
his
natural
sprightliness
while
the
author
of
nature
gives
children
this
active
principle
he
takes
care
that
it
shall
do
little
harm
for
he
leaves
them
little
power
to
indulge
it
but
no
sooner
do
they
look
upon
those
about
them
as
instruments
which
it
is
their
business
to
set
in
motion
than
they
make
use
of
them
in
following
their
own
inclinations
and
in
making
up
for
their
own
want
of
strength
in
this
way
they
become
disagreeable
tyrannical
imperious
perverse
unruly
a
development
not
arising
from
a
natural
spirit
of
domination
but
creating
such
a
spirit
for
no
very
long
experience
is
requisite
in
teaching
how
pleasant
it
is
to
act
through
others
and
to
need
only
move
one
tongue
to
set
the
world
in
motion
as
we
grow
up
we
gain
strength
we
become
less
uneasy
and
restless
we
shut
ourselves
more
within
ourselves
the
soul
and
the
body
put
themselves
in
equilibrium
as
it
were
and
nature
requires
no
more
motion
than
is
necessary
for
out
preservation
but
the
wish
to
command
outlives
the
necessity
from
which
it
sprang
power
to
control
others
awakens
and
gratifies
and
habit
makes
it
strong
thus
need
gives
place
to
whim
thus
do
prejudices
and
opinions
first
root
themselves
within
us
the
principle
once
understood
we
see
clearly
the
point
at
which
we
leave
the
path
of
nature
let
us
discover
what
we
ought
to
do
to
keep
within
it
far
from
having
too
much
strength
children
have
not
even
enough
for
all
that
nature
demands
of
them
we
ought
then
to
leave
them
the
free
use
of
all
natural
strength
which
they
can
not
misuse
first
maxim
we
must
aid
them
supplying
whatever
they
lack
in
intelligence
in
strength
in
all
that
belongs
to
physical
necessity
second
maxim
in
helping
them
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
what
is
really
of
use
to
them
yielding
nothing
to
their
whims
or
unreasonable
wishes
for
their
own
caprice
will
not
trouble
them
unless
we
ourselves
create
it
it
is
not
a
natural
thing
third
maxim
we
must
study
carefully
their
language
and
their
signs
so
that
at
an
age
when
they
can
not
dissemble
we
may
judge
which
of
their
desires
spring
from
nature
itself
and
which
of
them
from
opinion
fourth
maxim
the
meaning
of
these
rules
is
to
allow
children
more
personal
freedom
and
less
authority
to
let
them
do
more
for
themselves
and
exact
less
from
others
thus
accustomed
betimes
to
desire
only
what
they
can
obtain
or
do
for
themselves
they
will
feel
less
keenly
the
want
of
whatever
is
not
within
their
own
power
here
there
is
another
and
very
important
reason
for
leaving
children
absolutely
free
as
to
body
and
limbs
with
the
sole
precaution
of
keeping
them
from
the
danger
of
falling
and
of
putting
out
of
their
reach
everything
that
can
injure
them
doubtless
a
child
whose
body
and
arms
are
free
will
cry
less
than
one
bound
fast
in
swaddling
clothes
he
who
feels
only
physical
wants
cries
only
when
he
suffers
and
this
is
a
great
advantage
for
then
we
know
exactly
when
he
requires
help
and
we
ought
not
to
delay
one
moment
in
giving
him
help
if
possible
but
if
you
can
not
relieve
him
keep
quiet
do
not
try
to
soothe
him
by
petting
him
your
caresses
will
not
cure
his
colic
but
he
will
remember
what
he
has
to
do
in
order
to
be
petted
and
if
he
once
discovers
that
he
can
at
will
busy
you
about
him
he
will
have
become
your
master
the
mischief
is
done
if
children
were
not
so
much
thwarted
in
their
movements
they
would
not
cry
so
much
if
we
were
less
annoyed
by
their
crying
we
would
take
less
pains
to
hush
them
if
they
were
not
so
often
threatened
or
caressed
they
would
be
less
timid
or
less
stubborn
and
more
truly
themselves
as
nature
made
them
it
is
not
so
often
by
letting
children
cry
as
by
hastening
to
quiet
them
that
we
make
them
rupture
themselves
the
proof
of
this
is
that
the
children
most
neglected
are
less
subject
than
others
to
this
infirmity
i
am
far
from
wishing
them
to
be
neglected
however
on
the
contrary
we
ought
to
anticipate
their
wants
and
not
wait
to
be
notified
of
these
by
the
crying
yet
i
would
not
have
them
misunderstand
the
cares
we
bestow
on
them
why
should
they
consider
crying
a
fault
when
they
find
that
it
avails
so
much
knowing
the
value
of
their
silence
they
will
be
careful
not
to
be
lavish
of
it
they
will
at
last
make
it
so
costly
that
we
can
no
longer
pay
for
it
and
then
it
is
that
by
crying
without
success
they
strain
weaken
and
kill
themselves
the
long
crying
fits
of
a
child
who
is
not
compressed
or
ill
or
allowed
to
want
for
anything
are
from
habit
and
obstinacy
they
are
by
no
means
the
work
of
nature
but
of
the
nurse
who
because
she
can
not
endure
the
annoyance
multiplies
it
without
reflecting
that
by
stilling
the
child
he
is
induced
to
cry
the
more
the
only
way
to
cure
or
prevent
this
habit
is
to
pay
no
attention
to
it
no
one
not
even
a
child
likes
to
take
unnecessary
trouble
they
are
stubborn
in
their
attempts
but
if
you
have
more
firmness
than
they
have
obstinacy
they
are
discouraged
and
do
not
repeat
the
attempt
thus
we
spare
them
some
tears
and
accustom
them
to
cry
only
when
pain
forces
them
to
it
nevertheless
when
they
do
cry
from
caprice
or
stubbornness
a
sure
way
to
prevent
their
continuing
is
to
turn
their
attention
to
some
agreeable
and
striking
object
and
so
make
them
forget
their
desire
to
cry
in
this
art
most
nurses
excel
and
when
skilfully
employed
it
is
very
effective
but
it
is
highly
important
that
the
child
should
not
know
of
our
intention
to
divert
him
and
that
he
should
amuse
himself
without
at
all
thinking
we
have
him
in
mind
in
this
all
nurses
are
unskilful
all
children
are
weaned
too
early
the
proper
time
is
indicated
by
their
teething
this
process
is
usually
painful
and
distressing
by
a
mechanical
instinct
the
child
at
that
time
carries
to
his
mouth
and
chews
everything
he
holds
we
think
we
make
the
operation
easier
by
giving
him
for
a
plaything
some
hard
substance
such
as
ivory
or
coral
i
think
we
are
mistaken
far
from
softening
the
gums
these
hard
bodies
when
applied
render
them
hard
and
callous
and
prepare
the
way
for
a
more
painful
and
distressing
laceration
let
us
always
take
instinct
for
guide
we
never
see
puppies
try
their
growing
teeth
upon
flints
or
iron
or
bones
but
upon
wood
or
leather
or
rags
upon
soft
materials
which
give
way
and
on
which
the
tooth
impresses
itself
we
no
longer
aim
at
simplicity
even
where
children
are
concerned
golden
and
silver
bells
corals
crystals
toys
of
every
price
of
every
sort
what
useless
and
mischievous
affectations
they
are
let
there
be
none
of
them
no
bells
no
toys
a
little
twig
covered
with
its
own
leaves
and
fruit
a
in
which
the
seeds
can
be
heard
rattling
a
stick
of
liquorice
he
can
suck
and
chew
these
will
amuse
a
child
quite
as
well
as
the
splendid
baubles
and
will
not
disadvantage
him
by
accustoming
him
to
luxury
from
his
very
birth
language
from
the
time
they
are
born
children
hear
people
speak
they
are
spoken
to
not
only
before
they
understand
what
is
said
to
them
but
before
they
can
repeat
the
sounds
they
hear
their
organs
still
benumbed
adapt
themselves
only
by
degrees
to
imitating
the
sounds
dictated
to
them
and
it
is
not
even
certain
that
these
sounds
are
borne
to
their
ears
at
first
as
distinctly
as
to
ours
i
do
not
disapprove
of
a
nurse
amusing
the
child
with
songs
and
with
blithe
and
varied
tones
but
i
do
disapprove
of
her
perpetually
deafening
him
with
a
multitude
of
useless
words
of
which
he
understands
only
the
tone
she
gives
them
i
would
like
the
first
articulate
sounds
he
must
hear
to
be
few
in
number
easy
distinct
often
repeated
the
words
they
form
should
represent
only
material
objects
which
can
be
shown
him
our
unfortunate
readiness
to
content
ourselves
with
words
that
have
no
meaning
to
us
whatever
begins
earlier
than
we
suppose
even
as
in
his
the
child
hears
his
nurse
babble
he
hears
in
class
the
verbiage
of
his
teacher
it
strikes
me
that
if
he
were
to
be
so
brought
up
that
he
could
not
understand
it
at
all
he
would
be
very
well
instructed
reflections
crowd
upon
us
when
we
set
about
discussing
the
formation
of
children
language
and
their
baby
talk
itself
in
spite
of
us
they
always
learn
to
speak
by
the
same
process
and
all
our
philosophical
speculations
about
it
are
entirely
useless
they
seem
at
first
to
have
a
grammar
adapted
to
their
own
age
although
its
rules
of
syntax
are
more
general
than
ours
and
if
we
were
to
pay
close
attention
to
them
we
should
be
astonished
at
the
exactness
with
which
they
follow
certain
analogies
very
faulty
if
you
will
but
very
regular
that
are
displeasing
only
because
harsh
or
because
usage
does
not
recognize
them
it
is
unbearable
pedantry
and
a
most
useless
labor
to
attempt
correcting
in
children
every
little
fault
against
usage
they
never
fail
themselves
to
correct
these
faults
in
time
always
speak
correctly
in
their
presence
order
it
so
that
they
are
never
so
happy
with
any
one
as
with
you
and
rest
assured
their
language
will
insensibly
be
purified
by
your
own
without
your
having
ever
reproved
them
but
another
error
which
has
an
entirely
different
bearing
on
the
matter
and
is
no
less
easy
to
prevent
is
our
being
to
make
them
speak
as
if
we
feared
they
might
not
of
their
own
accord
learn
to
do
so
our
injudicious
haste
has
an
effect
exactly
contrary
to
what
we
wish
on
account
of
it
they
learn
more
slowly
and
speak
more
indistinctly
the
marked
attention
paid
to
everything
they
utter
makes
it
unnecessary
for
them
to
articulate
distinctly
as
they
hardly
condescend
to
open
their
lips
many
retain
throughout
life
an
imperfect
pronunciation
and
a
confused
manner
of
speaking
which
makes
them
nearly
unintelligible
children
who
are
too
much
urged
to
speak
have
not
time
sufficient
for
learning
either
to
pronounce
carefully
or
to
understand
thoroughly
what
they
are
made
to
say
if
instead
they
are
left
to
themselves
they
at
first
practise
using
the
syllables
they
can
most
readily
utter
and
gradually
attaching
to
these
some
meaning
that
can
be
gathered
from
their
gestures
they
give
you
their
own
words
before
acquiring
yours
thus
they
receive
yours
only
after
they
understand
them
not
being
urged
to
use
them
they
notice
carefully
what
meaning
you
give
them
and
when
they
are
sure
of
this
they
adopt
it
as
their
own
the
greatest
evil
arising
from
our
haste
to
make
children
speak
before
they
are
old
enough
is
not
that
our
first
talks
with
them
and
the
first
words
they
use
have
no
meaning
to
them
but
that
they
have
a
meaning
different
from
ours
without
our
being
able
to
perceive
it
thus
while
they
seem
to
be
answering
us
very
correctly
they
are
really
addressing
us
without
understanding
us
and
without
our
understanding
them
to
such
ambiguous
discourse
is
due
the
surprise
we
sometimes
feel
at
their
sayings
to
which
we
attach
ideas
the
children
themselves
have
not
dreamed
of
this
inattention
of
ours
to
the
true
meaning
words
have
for
children
seems
to
me
the
cause
of
their
first
mistakes
and
these
errors
even
after
children
are
cured
of
them
influence
their
turn
of
mind
for
the
remainder
of
their
life
the
first
developments
of
childhood
occur
almost
all
at
once
the
child
learns
to
speak
to
eat
to
walk
nearly
at
the
same
time
this
is
properly
the
first
epoch
of
his
life
before
then
he
is
nothing
more
than
he
was
before
he
was
born
he
has
not
a
sentiment
not
an
idea
he
scarcely
has
sensations
he
does
not
feel
even
his
own
existence
it
is
useless
to
enlarge
upon
the
absurdity
of
this
theory
and
upon
the
flagrant
contradiction
into
which
rousseau
allows
himself
to
fall
if
he
is
right
man
ought
to
be
left
without
education
and
the
earth
without
cultivation
this
would
not
be
even
the
savage
state
but
want
of
space
forbids
us
to
pause
at
each
like
statement
of
our
author
who
at
once
busies
himself
in
nullifying
it
the
voice
of
rousseau
was
heard
the
nursing
of
children
by
their
own
mothers
which
had
gone
into
disuse
as
vulgar
and
troublesome
became
a
fashion
great
ladies
prided
themselves
upon
returning
to
the
usage
of
nature
and
infants
were
brought
in
with
the
dessert
to
give
an
exhibition
of
maternal
tenderness
this
affectation
died
out
but
in
most
families
the
good
and
wholesome
custom
of
motherhood
was
retained
this
page
of
rousseau
contributed
its
share
to
the
happy
result
this
remark
is
not
a
just
one
how
often
have
we
seen
unhappy
creatures
disgusted
with
life
because
of
some
dreadful
and
incurable
malady
it
is
true
that
suicide
being
an
act
of
madness
is
more
frequently
caused
by
those
troubles
which
imagination
delights
itself
in
magnifying
up
to
the
point
of
insanity
this
is
an
allusion
to
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
episodes
in
the
life
of
rousseau
his
abandoning
of
the
children
whom
thérèse
levasseur
bore
him
and
whom
he
sent
to
a
foundling
hospital
because
he
felt
within
him
neither
courage
to
labor
for
their
support
nor
capacity
to
educate
them
sad
practical
defect
in
this
teacher
of
theories
of
education
for
the
particular
example
of
education
which
he
supposes
rousseau
creates
a
tutor
whom
he
consecrates
absolutely
exclusively
to
the
work
he
desires
one
so
perfect
that
he
calls
him
a
prodigy
let
us
not
blame
him
for
this
the
ideal
of
those
who
assume
the
noble
and
difficult
office
of
a
teacher
of
childhood
can
not
be
placed
too
high
as
to
the
pupil
rousseau
imagines
a
child
of
average
ability
in
easy
circumstances
and
of
robust
health
he
makes
him
an
only
son
and
an
orphan
so
that
no
family
vicissitudes
may
disturb
the
logic
of
his
plan
all
this
may
be
summed
up
by
saying
that
he
considers
the
child
in
himself
with
regard
to
his
individual
development
and
without
regard
to
his
relations
to
ordinary
life
this
at
the
same
time
renders
his
task
easy
and
deprives
him
of
an
important
element
of
education
no
doubt
this
sarcasm
is
applicable
to
those
teachers
who
talk
so
as
to
say
nothing
a
teacher
ought
on
the
contrary
to
speak
only
so
as
to
be
understood
by
the
child
he
ought
to
adapt
himself
to
the
child
capacity
to
employ
no
useless
or
conventional
expressions
his
language
ought
to
arouse
curiosity
and
to
impart
light
book
second
the
second
book
takes
the
child
at
about
the
fifth
year
and
conducts
him
to
about
the
twelfth
year
he
is
no
longer
the
little
child
he
is
the
young
boy
his
education
becomes
more
important
it
consists
not
in
studies
in
reading
or
writing
or
in
duties
but
in
plays
in
ingenious
recreations
in
experiments
there
should
be
no
exaggerated
precautions
and
on
the
other
hand
no
harshness
no
punishments
we
must
love
the
child
and
encourage
his
playing
to
make
him
realize
his
weakness
and
the
narrow
limits
within
which
it
can
work
to
keep
the
child
dependent
only
on
circumstances
will
suffice
without
ever
making
him
feel
the
yoke
of
the
master
the
best
education
is
accomplished
in
the
country
teaching
by
means
of
things
criticism
of
the
ordinary
method
education
of
the
senses
by
continually
exercising
them
avoid
taking
too
many
precautions
this
is
the
second
period
of
life
and
the
one
at
which
properly
speaking
infancy
ends
for
the
words
and
are
not
synonymous
the
first
is
included
in
the
second
and
means
who
can
not
thus
in
valerius
maximus
we
find
the
expression
but
i
shall
continue
to
employ
the
word
according
to
the
usage
of
the
french
language
until
i
am
describing
the
age
for
which
there
are
other
names
when
children
begin
to
speak
they
cry
less
often
this
step
in
advance
is
natural
one
language
is
substituted
for
another
as
soon
as
they
can
utter
their
complaints
in
words
why
should
they
cry
unless
the
suffering
is
too
keen
to
be
expressed
by
words
if
they
then
continue
to
cry
it
is
the
fault
of
those
around
them
after
émile
has
once
said
it
hurts
me
only
acute
suffering
can
force
him
to
cry
if
the
child
is
physically
so
delicate
and
sensitive
that
he
naturally
cries
about
nothing
i
will
soon
exhaust
the
fountain
of
his
tears
by
making
them
ineffectual
so
long
as
he
cries
i
will
not
go
to
him
as
soon
as
he
stops
i
will
run
to
him
very
soon
his
method
of
calling
me
will
be
to
keep
quiet
or
at
the
utmost
to
utter
a
single
cry
children
judge
of
the
meaning
of
signs
by
their
palpable
effect
they
have
no
other
rule
whatever
harm
a
child
may
do
himself
he
very
rarely
cries
when
alone
unless
with
the
hope
of
being
heard
if
he
fall
if
he
bruise
his
head
if
his
nose
bleed
if
he
cut
his
finger
i
should
instead
of
bustling
about
him
with
a
look
of
alarm
remain
quiet
at
least
for
a
little
while
the
mischief
is
done
he
must
endure
it
all
my
anxiety
will
only
serve
to
frighten
him
more
and
to
increase
his
sensitiveness
after
all
when
we
hurt
ourselves
it
is
less
the
shock
which
pains
us
than
the
fright
i
will
spare
him
at
least
this
last
pang
for
he
will
certainly
estimate
his
hurt
as
he
sees
me
estimate
it
if
he
sees
me
run
anxiously
to
comfort
and
to
pity
him
he
will
think
himself
seriously
hurt
but
if
he
sees
me
keep
my
presence
of
mind
he
will
soon
recover
his
own
and
will
think
the
pain
cured
when
he
no
longer
feels
it
at
his
age
we
learn
our
first
lessons
in
courage
and
by
fearlessly
enduring
lighter
sufferings
we
gradually
learn
to
bear
the
heavier
ones
far
from
taking
care
that
émile
does
not
hurt
himself
i
shall
be
dissatisfied
if
he
never
does
and
so
grows
up
unacquainted
with
pain
to
suffer
is
the
first
and
most
necessary
thing
for
him
to
learn
children
are
little
and
weak
apparently
that
they
may
learn
these
important
lessons
if
a
child
fall
his
whole
length
he
will
not
break
his
leg
if
he
strike
himself
with
a
stick
he
will
not
break
his
arm
if
he
lay
hold
of
an
edged
tool
he
does
not
grasp
it
tightly
and
will
not
cut
himself
very
badly
our
pedantic
mania
for
instructing
constantly
leads
us
to
teach
children
what
they
can
learn
far
better
for
themselves
and
to
lose
sight
of
what
we
alone
can
teach
them
is
there
anything
more
absurd
than
the
pains
we
take
in
teaching
them
to
walk
as
if
we
had
ever
seen
one
who
through
his
nurse
negligence
did
not
know
how
to
walk
when
grown
on
the
contrary
how
many
people
do
we
see
moving
awkwardly
all
their
lives
because
they
have
been
badly
taught
how
to
walk
émile
shall
have
no
nor
carriages
nor
nor
or
at
least
from
the
time
when
he
begins
to
be
able
to
put
one
foot
before
the
other
he
shall
not
be
supported
except
over
paved
places
and
he
shall
be
hurried
over
these
instead
of
letting
him
suffocate
in
the
exhausted
air
indoors
let
him
be
taken
every
day
far
out
into
the
fields
there
let
him
run
about
play
fall
down
a
hundred
times
a
day
the
oftener
the
better
as
he
will
the
sooner
learn
to
get
up
again
by
himself
the
boon
of
freedom
is
worth
many
scars
my
pupil
will
have
many
bruises
but
to
make
amends
for
that
he
will
be
always
though
your
pupils
are
less
often
hurt
they
are
continually
thwarted
fettered
they
are
always
unhappy
i
doubt
whether
the
advantage
be
on
their
side
the
development
of
their
physical
strength
makes
complaint
less
necessary
to
children
when
able
to
help
themselves
they
have
less
need
of
the
help
of
others
knowledge
to
direct
their
strength
grows
with
that
strength
at
this
second
stage
the
life
of
the
individual
properly
begins
he
now
becomes
conscious
of
his
own
being
memory
extends
this
feeling
of
personal
identity
to
every
moment
of
his
existence
he
becomes
really
one
the
same
one
and
consequently
capable
of
happiness
or
of
misery
we
must
therefore
from
this
moment
begin
to
regard
him
as
a
moral
being
childhood
is
to
be
loved
although
the
longest
term
of
human
life
and
the
probability
at
any
given
age
of
reaching
this
term
have
been
computed
nothing
is
more
uncertain
than
the
continuance
of
each
individual
life
very
few
attain
the
maximum
the
greatest
risks
in
life
are
at
its
beginning
the
less
one
has
lived
the
less
prospect
he
has
of
living
of
all
children
born
only
about
half
reach
youth
and
it
is
probable
that
your
pupil
may
never
attain
to
manhood
what
then
must
be
thought
of
that
barbarous
education
which
sacrifices
the
present
to
an
uncertain
future
loads
the
child
with
every
description
of
fetters
and
begins
by
making
him
wretched
to
prepare
for
him
some
indefinite
happiness
he
may
never
enjoy
even
supposing
the
object
of
such
an
education
reasonable
how
can
we
without
indignation
see
the
unfortunate
creatures
bowed
under
an
insupportable
yoke
doomed
to
constant
labor
like
so
many
without
any
certainty
that
all
this
toil
will
ever
be
of
use
to
them
the
years
that
ought
to
be
bright
and
cheerful
are
passed
in
tears
amid
punishments
threats
and
slavery
for
his
own
good
the
unhappy
child
is
tortured
and
the
death
thus
summoned
will
seize
on
him
unperceived
amidst
all
this
melancholy
preparation
who
knows
how
many
children
die
on
account
of
the
extravagant
prudence
of
a
father
or
of
a
teacher
happy
in
escaping
his
cruelty
it
gives
them
one
advantage
they
leave
without
regret
a
life
which
they
know
only
from
its
darker
side
o
men
be
humane
it
is
your
highest
duty
be
humane
to
all
conditions
of
men
to
every
age
to
everything
not
alien
to
mankind
what
higher
wisdom
is
there
for
you
than
humanity
love
childhood
encourage
its
sports
its
pleasures
its
lovable
instincts
who
among
us
has
not
at
times
looked
back
with
regret
to
the
age
when
a
smile
was
continually
on
our
lips
when
the
soul
was
always
at
peace
why
should
we
rob
these
little
innocent
creatures
of
the
enjoyment
of
a
time
so
brief
so
transient
of
a
boon
so
precious
which
they
can
not
misuse
why
will
you
fill
with
bitterness
and
sorrow
these
fleeting
years
which
can
no
more
return
to
them
than
to
you
do
you
know
you
fathers
the
moment
when
death
awaits
your
children
do
not
store
up
for
yourselves
remorse
by
taking
from
them
the
brief
moments
nature
has
given
them
as
soon
as
they
can
appreciate
the
delights
of
existence
let
them
enjoy
it
at
whatever
hour
god
may
call
them
let
them
not
die
without
having
tasted
life
at
all
you
answer
it
is
the
time
to
correct
the
evil
tendencies
of
the
human
heart
in
childhood
when
sufferings
are
less
keenly
felt
they
ought
to
be
multiplied
so
that
fewer
of
them
will
have
to
be
encountered
during
the
age
of
reason
but
who
has
told
you
that
it
is
your
province
to
make
this
arrangement
and
that
all
these
fine
instructions
with
which
you
burden
the
tender
mind
of
a
child
will
not
one
day
be
more
pernicious
than
useful
to
him
who
assures
you
that
you
spare
him
anything
when
you
deal
him
afflictions
with
so
lavish
a
hand
why
do
you
cause
him
more
unhappiness
than
he
can
bear
when
you
are
not
sure
that
the
future
will
compensate
him
for
these
present
evils
and
how
can
you
prove
that
the
evil
tendencies
of
which
you
pretend
to
cure
him
will
not
arise
from
your
mistaken
care
rather
than
from
nature
itself
unhappy
foresight
which
renders
a
creature
actually
miserable
in
the
hope
well
or
ill
founded
of
one
day
making
him
happy
if
these
vulgar
reasoners
confound
license
with
liberty
and
mistake
a
spoiled
child
for
a
child
who
is
made
happy
let
us
teach
them
to
distinguish
the
two
to
avoid
being
misled
let
us
remember
what
really
accords
with
our
present
abilities
humanity
has
its
place
in
the
general
order
of
things
childhood
has
its
place
in
the
order
of
human
life
mankind
must
be
considered
in
the
individual
man
and
childhood
in
the
individual
child
to
assign
each
his
place
and
to
establish
him
in
it
to
direct
human
passions
as
human
nature
will
permit
is
all
we
can
do
for
his
welfare
the
rest
depends
on
outside
influences
not
under
our
control
neither
slaves
nor
tyrants
he
alone
has
his
own
way
who
to
compass
it
does
not
need
the
arm
of
another
to
lengthen
his
own
consequently
freedom
and
not
authority
is
the
greatest
good
a
man
who
desires
only
what
he
can
do
for
himself
is
really
free
to
do
whatever
he
pleases
from
this
axiom
if
it
be
applied
to
the
case
of
childhood
all
the
rules
of
education
will
follow
a
wise
man
understands
how
to
remain
in
his
own
place
but
a
child
who
does
not
know
his
can
not
preserve
it
as
matters
stand
there
are
a
thousand
ways
of
leaving
it
those
who
govern
him
are
to
keep
him
in
it
and
this
is
not
an
easy
task
he
ought
to
be
neither
an
animal
nor
a
man
but
a
child
he
should
feel
his
weakness
and
yet
not
suffer
from
it
he
should
depend
not
obey
he
should
demand
not
command
he
is
subject
to
others
only
by
reason
of
his
needs
and
because
others
see
better
than
he
what
is
useful
to
him
what
will
contribute
to
his
or
will
impair
it
no
one
not
even
his
father
has
a
right
to
command
a
child
to
do
what
is
of
no
use
to
him
whatever
accustom
the
child
to
depend
only
on
circumstances
and
as
his
education
goes
on
you
will
follow
the
order
of
nature
never
oppose
to
his
imprudent
wishes
anything
but
physical
obstacles
or
punishments
which
arise
from
the
actions
themselves
and
which
he
will
remember
when
the
occasion
comes
it
is
enough
to
prevent
his
doing
harm
without
forbidding
it
with
him
only
experience
or
want
of
power
should
take
the
place
of
law
do
not
give
him
anything
because
he
asks
for
it
but
because
he
needs
it
when
he
acts
do
not
let
him
know
that
it
is
from
obedience
and
when
another
acts
for
him
let
him
not
feel
that
he
is
exercising
authority
let
him
feel
his
liberty
as
much
in
your
actions
as
in
his
own
add
to
the
power
he
lacks
exactly
enough
to
make
him
free
and
not
imperious
so
that
accepting
your
aid
with
a
kind
of
humiliation
he
may
aspire
to
the
moment
when
he
can
dispense
with
it
and
have
the
honor
of
serving
himself
for
strengthening
the
body
and
promoting
its
growth
nature
has
means
which
ought
never
to
be
thwarted
a
child
ought
not
to
be
constrained
to
stay
anywhere
when
he
wishes
to
go
away
or
to
go
away
when
he
wishes
to
stay
when
their
will
is
not
spoiled
by
our
own
fault
children
do
not
wish
for
anything
without
good
reason
they
ought
to
leap
to
run
to
shout
whenever
they
will
all
their
movements
are
necessities
of
nature
which
is
endeavoring
to
strengthen
itself
but
we
must
take
heed
of
those
wishes
they
can
not
themselves
accomplish
but
must
fulfil
by
the
hand
of
another
therefore
care
should
be
taken
to
distinguish
the
real
wants
the
wants
of
nature
from
those
which
arise
from
fancy
or
from
the
redundant
life
just
mentioned
i
have
already
suggested
what
should
be
done
when
a
child
cries
for
anything
i
will
only
add
that
as
soon
as
he
can
ask
in
words
for
what
he
wants
and
to
obtain
it
sooner
or
to
overcome
a
refusal
reinforces
his
request
by
crying
it
should
never
be
granted
him
if
necessity
has
made
him
speak
you
ought
to
know
it
and
at
once
to
grant
what
he
demands
but
yielding
to
his
tears
is
encouraging
him
to
shed
them
it
teaches
him
to
doubt
your
good
will
and
to
believe
that
importunity
has
more
influence
over
you
than
your
own
kindness
of
heart
has
if
he
does
not
believe
you
good
he
will
soon
be
bad
if
he
believes
you
weak
he
will
soon
be
stubborn
it
is
of
great
importance
that
you
at
once
consent
to
what
you
do
not
intend
to
refuse
him
do
not
refuse
often
but
never
revoke
a
refusal
above
all
things
beware
of
teaching
the
child
empty
formulas
of
politeness
which
shall
serve
him
instead
of
magic
words
to
subject
to
his
own
wishes
all
who
surround
him
and
to
obtain
instantly
what
he
likes
in
the
artificial
education
of
the
rich
they
are
infallibly
made
politely
imperious
by
having
prescribed
to
them
what
terms
to
use
so
that
no
one
shall
dare
resist
them
such
children
have
neither
the
tones
nor
the
speech
of
suppliants
they
are
as
arrogant
when
they
request
as
when
they
command
and
even
more
so
for
in
the
former
case
they
are
more
sure
of
being
obeyed
from
the
first
it
is
readily
seen
that
coming
from
them
if
you
please
means
it
pleases
me
and
that
i
beg
signifies
i
order
you
singular
politeness
this
by
which
they
only
change
the
meaning
of
words
and
so
never
speak
but
with
authority
for
myself
i
dread
far
less
émile
being
rude
than
his
being
arrogant
i
would
rather
have
him
say
do
this
as
if
requesting
than
i
beg
you
as
if
commanding
i
attach
far
less
importance
to
the
term
he
uses
than
to
the
meaning
he
associates
with
it
and
are
equally
to
be
avoided
if
you
let
children
suffer
you
endanger
their
health
and
their
life
you
make
them
actually
wretched
if
you
carefully
spare
them
every
kind
of
annoyance
you
are
storing
up
for
them
much
unhappiness
you
are
making
them
delicate
and
sensitive
to
pain
you
are
removing
them
from
the
common
lot
of
man
into
which
in
spite
of
all
your
care
they
will
one
day
return
to
save
them
some
natural
discomforts
you
contrive
for
them
others
which
nature
has
not
inflicted
you
will
charge
me
with
falling
into
the
mistake
of
those
fathers
i
have
reproached
for
sacrificing
their
children
happiness
to
considerations
of
a
future
that
may
never
be
not
so
for
the
freedom
i
give
my
pupil
will
amply
supply
him
with
the
slight
discomforts
to
which
i
leave
him
exposed
i
see
the
little
rogues
playing
in
the
snow
blue
with
cold
and
scarcely
able
to
move
their
fingers
they
have
only
to
go
and
warm
themselves
but
they
do
nothing
of
the
kind
if
they
are
compelled
to
do
so
they
feel
the
constraint
a
hundred
times
more
than
they
do
the
cold
why
then
do
you
complain
shall
i
make
your
child
unhappy
if
i
expose
him
only
to
those
inconveniences
he
is
perfectly
willing
to
endure
by
leaving
him
at
liberty
i
do
him
service
now
by
arming
him
against
the
ills
he
must
encounter
i
do
him
service
for
the
time
to
come
if
he
could
choose
between
being
my
pupil
or
yours
do
you
think
he
would
hesitate
a
moment
can
we
conceive
of
any
creature
being
truly
happy
outside
of
what
belongs
to
its
own
peculiar
nature
and
if
we
would
have
a
man
exempt
from
all
human
misfortunes
would
it
not
estrange
him
from
humanity
undoubtedly
it
would
for
we
are
so
constituted
that
to
appreciate
great
good
fortune
we
must
be
acquainted
with
slight
misfortunes
if
the
body
be
too
much
at
ease
the
moral
nature
becomes
corrupted
the
man
unacquainted
with
suffering
would
not
know
the
tender
feelings
of
humanity
or
the
sweetness
of
compassion
he
would
not
be
a
social
being
he
would
be
a
monster
among
his
kind
the
surest
way
to
make
a
child
unhappy
is
to
accustom
him
to
obtain
everything
he
wants
to
have
for
since
his
wishes
multiply
in
proportion
to
the
ease
with
which
they
are
gratified
your
inability
to
fulfil
them
will
sooner
or
later
oblige
you
to
refuse
in
spite
of
yourself
and
this
unwonted
refusal
will
pain
him
more
than
withholding
from
him
what
he
demands
at
first
he
will
want
the
cane
you
hold
soon
he
will
want
your
watch
afterward
he
will
want
the
bird
he
sees
flying
or
the
star
he
sees
shining
he
will
want
everything
he
sees
and
without
being
god
himself
how
can
you
content
him
man
is
naturally
disposed
to
regard
as
his
own
whatever
is
within
his
power
in
this
sense
the
principle
of
hobbes
is
correct
up
to
a
certain
point
multiply
with
our
desires
the
means
of
satisfying
them
and
each
of
us
will
make
himself
master
of
everything
hence
the
child
who
has
only
to
wish
in
order
to
obtain
his
wish
thinks
himself
the
owner
of
the
universe
he
regards
all
men
as
his
slaves
and
when
at
last
he
must
be
denied
something
he
believing
everything
possible
when
he
commands
it
takes
refusal
for
an
act
of
rebellion
at
his
age
incapable
of
reasoning
all
reasons
given
seem
to
him
only
pretexts
he
sees
in
everything
the
feeling
of
imagined
injustice
embitters
his
temper
he
begins
to
hate
everybody
and
without
ever
being
thankful
for
kindness
is
angry
at
any
opposition
whatever
who
supposes
that
a
child
thus
ruled
by
anger
a
prey
to
furious
passions
can
ever
be
happy
he
happy
he
is
a
tyrant
that
is
the
vilest
of
slaves
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
miserable
of
beings
i
have
seen
children
thus
reared
who
wanted
those
about
them
to
push
the
house
down
to
give
them
the
weathercock
they
saw
on
a
steeple
to
stop
the
march
of
a
regiment
so
that
they
could
enjoy
the
a
little
longer
and
as
soon
as
obedience
to
these
demands
was
delayed
they
rent
the
air
with
their
screams
and
would
listen
to
no
one
in
vain
everybody
tried
eagerly
to
gratify
them
the
ease
with
which
they
found
their
wishes
obeyed
stimulated
them
to
desire
more
and
to
be
stubborn
about
impossibilities
everywhere
they
found
only
contradictions
impediments
suffering
and
sorrow
always
complaining
always
refractory
always
angry
they
spent
the
time
in
crying
and
fretting
were
these
creatures
happy
authority
and
weakness
conjoined
produce
only
madness
and
wretchedness
one
of
two
spoiled
children
beats
the
table
and
the
other
has
the
sea
lashed
they
will
have
much
to
beat
and
to
lash
before
they
are
satisfied
with
life
if
these
ideas
of
authority
and
of
tyranny
make
them
unhappy
from
their
very
childhood
how
will
it
be
with
them
when
they
are
grown
and
when
their
relations
with
others
begin
to
be
extended
and
multiplied
accustomed
to
seeing
everything
give
way
before
them
how
surprised
they
will
be
on
entering
the
world
to
find
themselves
crushed
beneath
the
weight
of
that
universe
they
have
expected
to
move
at
their
own
pleasure
their
insolent
airs
and
childish
vanity
will
only
bring
upon
them
mortification
contempt
and
ridicule
they
must
swallow
affront
after
affront
cruel
trials
will
teach
them
that
they
understand
neither
their
own
position
nor
their
own
strength
unable
to
do
everything
they
will
think
themselves
unable
to
do
anything
so
many
unusual
obstacles
dishearten
them
so
much
contempt
degrades
them
they
become
base
cowardly
cringing
and
sink
as
far
below
their
real
self
as
they
had
imagined
themselves
above
it
let
us
return
to
the
original
order
of
things
nature
has
made
children
to
be
loved
and
helped
has
she
made
them
to
be
obeyed
and
feared
has
she
given
them
an
imposing
air
a
stern
eye
a
harsh
and
threatening
voice
so
that
they
may
inspire
fear
i
can
understand
why
the
roar
of
a
lion
fills
other
creatures
with
dread
and
why
they
tremble
at
sight
of
his
terrible
countenance
but
if
ever
there
were
an
unbecoming
hateful
ridiculous
spectacle
it
is
that
of
a
body
of
magistrates
in
their
robes
of
ceremony
and
headed
by
their
chief
prostrate
before
an
infant
in
long
clothes
who
to
their
pompous
harangue
replies
only
by
screams
or
by
childish
drivel
considering
infancy
in
itself
is
there
a
creature
on
earth
more
helpless
more
unhappy
more
at
the
mercy
of
everything
around
him
more
in
need
of
compassion
of
care
of
protection
than
a
child
does
it
not
seem
as
if
his
sweet
face
and
touching
aspect
were
intended
to
interest
every
one
who
comes
near
him
and
to
urge
them
to
assist
his
weakness
what
then
is
more
outrageous
more
contrary
to
the
fitness
of
things
than
to
see
an
imperious
and
headstrong
child
ordering
about
those
around
him
impudently
taking
the
tone
of
a
master
toward
those
who
to
destroy
him
need
only
leave
him
to
himself
on
the
other
hand
who
does
not
see
that
since
the
weakness
of
infancy
fetters
children
in
so
many
ways
we
are
barbarous
if
we
add
to
this
natural
subjection
a
bondage
to
our
own
caprices
by
taking
from
them
the
limited
freedom
they
have
a
freedom
they
are
so
little
able
to
misuse
and
from
the
loss
of
which
we
and
they
have
so
little
to
gain
as
nothing
is
more
ridiculous
than
a
haughty
child
so
nothing
is
more
pitiable
than
a
cowardly
child
since
with
years
of
reason
civil
bondage
begins
why
anticipate
it
by
slavery
at
home
let
us
leave
one
moment
of
life
exempt
from
a
yoke
nature
has
not
laid
upon
us
and
allow
childhood
the
exercise
of
that
natural
liberty
which
keeps
it
safe
at
least
for
a
time
from
the
vices
taught
by
slavery
let
the
teacher
and
the
parent
both
come
with
their
empty
cavils
and
before
they
boast
of
their
own
methods
let
them
learn
the
method
of
nature
herself
reasoning
should
not
begin
too
soon
locke
great
maxim
was
that
we
ought
to
reason
with
children
and
just
now
this
maxim
is
much
in
fashion
i
think
however
that
its
success
does
not
warrant
its
reputation
and
i
find
nothing
more
stupid
than
children
who
have
been
so
much
reasoned
with
reason
apparently
a
compound
of
all
other
faculties
the
one
latest
developed
and
with
most
difficulty
is
the
one
proposed
as
agent
in
unfolding
the
faculties
earliest
used
the
noblest
work
of
education
is
to
make
a
reasoning
man
and
we
expect
to
train
a
young
child
by
making
him
reason
this
is
beginning
at
the
end
this
is
making
an
instrument
of
a
result
if
children
understood
how
to
reason
they
would
not
need
to
be
educated
but
by
addressing
them
from
their
tenderest
years
in
a
language
they
can
not
understand
you
accustom
them
to
be
satisfied
with
words
to
find
fault
with
whatever
is
said
to
them
to
think
themselves
as
wise
as
their
teachers
to
wrangle
and
rebel
and
what
we
mean
they
shall
do
from
reasonable
motives
we
are
forced
to
obtain
from
them
by
adding
the
motive
of
avarice
or
of
fear
or
of
vanity
nature
intends
that
children
shall
be
children
before
they
are
men
if
we
insist
on
reversing
this
order
we
shall
have
fruit
early
indeed
but
unripe
and
tasteless
and
liable
to
early
decay
we
shall
have
young
savants
and
old
children
childhood
has
its
own
methods
of
seeing
thinking
and
feeling
nothing
shows
less
sense
than
to
try
to
substitute
our
own
methods
for
these
i
would
rather
require
a
child
ten
years
old
to
be
five
feet
tall
than
to
be
judicious
indeed
what
use
would
he
have
at
that
age
for
the
power
to
reason
it
is
a
check
upon
physical
strength
and
the
child
needs
none
in
attempting
to
persuade
your
pupils
to
obedience
you
add
to
this
alleged
persuasion
force
and
threats
or
worse
still
flattery
and
promises
bought
over
in
this
way
by
interest
or
constrained
by
force
they
pretend
to
be
convinced
by
reason
they
see
plainly
that
as
soon
as
you
discover
obedience
or
disobedience
in
their
conduct
the
former
is
an
advantage
and
the
latter
a
disadvantage
to
them
but
you
ask
of
them
only
what
is
distasteful
to
them
it
is
always
irksome
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
another
so
by
stealth
they
carry
out
their
own
they
are
sure
that
if
their
disobedience
is
not
known
they
are
doing
well
but
they
are
ready
for
fear
of
greater
evils
to
acknowledge
if
found
out
that
they
are
doing
wrong
as
the
reason
for
the
duty
required
is
beyond
their
capacity
no
one
can
make
them
really
understand
it
but
the
fear
of
punishment
the
hope
of
forgiveness
your
importunity
their
difficulty
in
answering
you
extort
from
them
the
confession
required
of
them
you
think
you
have
convinced
them
when
you
have
only
wearied
them
out
or
intimidated
them
what
results
from
this
first
of
all
that
by
imposing
upon
them
a
duty
they
do
not
feel
as
such
you
set
them
against
your
tyranny
and
dissuade
them
from
loving
you
you
teach
them
to
be
dissemblers
deceitful
willfully
untrue
for
the
sake
of
extorting
rewards
or
of
escaping
punishments
finally
by
habituating
them
to
cover
a
secret
motive
by
an
apparent
motive
you
give
them
the
means
of
constantly
misleading
you
of
concealing
their
true
character
from
you
and
of
satisfying
yourself
and
others
with
empty
words
when
their
occasion
demands
you
may
say
that
the
law
although
binding
on
the
conscience
uses
constraint
in
dealing
with
grown
men
i
grant
it
but
what
are
these
men
but
children
spoiled
by
their
education
this
is
precisely
what
ought
to
be
prevented
with
children
use
force
with
men
reason
such
is
the
natural
order
of
things
the
wise
man
requires
no
laws
liberty
treat
your
pupil
as
his
age
demands
from
the
first
assign
him
to
his
true
place
and
keep
him
there
so
effectually
that
he
will
not
try
to
leave
it
then
without
knowing
what
wisdom
is
he
will
practise
its
most
important
lesson
never
absolutely
never
command
him
to
do
a
thing
whatever
it
may
be
do
not
let
him
even
imagine
that
you
claim
any
authority
over
him
let
him
know
only
that
he
is
weak
and
you
are
strong
that
from
his
condition
and
yours
he
is
necessarily
at
your
mercy
let
him
know
this
learn
it
and
feel
it
let
him
early
know
that
upon
his
haughty
neck
is
the
stern
yoke
nature
imposes
upon
man
the
heavy
yoke
of
necessity
under
which
every
finite
being
must
toil
let
him
discover
this
necessity
in
the
nature
of
things
never
in
human
caprice
let
the
rein
that
holds
him
back
be
power
not
authority
do
not
forbid
but
prevent
his
doing
what
he
ought
not
and
in
thus
preventing
him
use
no
explanations
give
no
reasons
what
you
grant
him
grant
at
the
first
asking
without
any
urging
any
entreaty
from
him
and
above
all
without
conditions
consent
with
pleasure
and
refuse
unwillingly
but
let
every
refusal
be
irrevocable
let
no
importunity
move
you
let
the
no
once
uttered
be
a
wall
of
brass
against
which
the
child
will
have
to
exhaust
his
strength
only
five
or
six
times
before
he
ceases
trying
to
overturn
it
in
this
way
you
will
make
him
patient
resigned
gentle
even
when
he
has
not
what
he
wants
for
it
is
in
our
nature
to
endure
patiently
the
decrees
of
fate
but
not
the
of
others
there
is
no
more
is
an
answer
against
which
no
child
ever
rebelled
unless
he
believed
it
untrue
besides
there
is
no
other
way
either
nothing
at
all
is
to
be
required
of
him
or
he
must
from
the
first
be
accustomed
to
perfect
obedience
the
worst
training
of
all
is
to
leave
him
wavering
between
his
own
will
and
yours
and
to
dispute
incessantly
with
him
as
to
which
shall
be
master
i
should
a
hundred
times
prefer
his
being
master
in
every
case
it
is
marvellous
that
in
undertaking
to
educate
a
child
no
other
means
of
guiding
him
should
have
been
devised
than
emulation
jealousy
envy
vanity
greed
vile
fear
all
of
them
passions
most
dangerous
readiest
to
ferment
fittest
to
corrupt
a
soul
even
before
the
body
is
for
each
instruction
too
early
put
into
a
child
head
a
vice
is
deeply
implanted
in
his
heart
foolish
teachers
think
they
are
doing
wonders
when
they
make
a
child
wicked
in
order
to
teach
him
what
goodness
is
and
then
they
gravely
tell
us
such
is
man
yes
such
is
the
man
you
have
made
all
means
have
been
tried
save
one
and
that
the
very
one
which
insures
success
namely
freedom
we
ought
not
to
undertake
a
child
education
unless
we
know
how
to
lead
him
wherever
we
please
solely
by
the
laws
of
the
possible
and
the
impossible
the
sphere
of
both
being
alike
unknown
to
him
we
may
extend
or
contract
it
around
him
as
we
will
we
may
bind
him
down
incite
him
to
action
restrain
him
by
the
leash
of
necessity
alone
and
he
will
not
murmur
we
may
render
him
pliant
and
teachable
by
the
force
of
circumstances
alone
without
giving
any
vice
an
opportunity
to
take
root
within
him
for
the
passions
never
awake
to
life
so
long
as
they
are
of
no
avail
do
not
give
your
pupil
any
sort
of
lesson
verbally
he
ought
to
receive
none
except
from
experience
inflict
upon
him
no
kind
of
punishment
for
he
does
not
know
what
being
in
fault
means
never
oblige
him
to
ask
pardon
for
he
does
not
know
what
it
is
to
offend
you
his
actions
being
without
moral
quality
he
can
do
nothing
which
is
morally
bad
or
which
deserves
either
punishment
or
reproof
already
i
see
the
startled
reader
judging
of
this
child
by
those
around
us
but
he
is
mistaken
the
perpetual
constraint
under
which
you
keep
your
pupils
increases
their
liveliness
the
more
cramped
they
are
while
under
your
eye
the
more
unruly
they
are
the
moment
they
escape
it
they
must
in
fact
make
themselves
amends
for
the
severe
restraint
you
put
upon
them
two
from
a
city
will
do
more
mischief
in
a
community
than
the
young
people
of
a
whole
village
shut
up
in
the
same
room
a
little
gentleman
and
a
little
peasant
the
former
will
have
everything
upset
and
broken
before
the
latter
has
moved
from
his
place
why
is
this
because
the
one
hastens
to
misuse
a
moment
of
liberty
and
the
other
always
sure
of
his
freedom
is
never
in
a
hurry
to
use
it
and
yet
the
children
of
villagers
often
petted
or
thwarted
are
still
very
far
from
the
condition
in
which
i
should
wish
to
keep
them
proceed
slowly
may
i
venture
to
state
here
the
greatest
the
most
important
the
most
useful
rule
in
all
education
it
is
not
to
gain
time
but
to
lose
it
forgive
the
paradox
o
my
ordinary
reader
it
must
be
uttered
by
any
one
who
reflects
and
whatever
you
may
say
i
prefer
paradoxes
to
prejudices
the
most
perilous
interval
of
human
life
is
that
between
birth
and
the
age
of
twelve
years
at
that
time
errors
and
vices
take
root
without
our
having
any
means
of
destroying
them
and
when
the
instrument
is
found
the
time
for
uprooting
them
is
past
if
children
could
spring
at
one
bound
from
the
mother
breast
to
the
age
of
reason
the
education
given
them
would
be
suitable
but
in
the
due
order
of
nature
they
need
one
entirely
different
they
should
not
use
the
mind
at
all
until
it
has
all
its
faculties
for
while
it
is
blind
it
can
not
see
the
torch
you
present
to
it
nor
can
it
follow
on
the
immense
plain
of
ideas
a
path
which
even
for
the
keenest
eyesight
reason
traces
so
faintly
the
earliest
education
ought
then
to
be
purely
negative
it
consists
not
in
teaching
truth
or
virtue
but
in
shielding
the
heart
from
vice
and
the
mind
from
error
if
you
could
do
nothing
at
all
and
allow
nothing
to
be
done
if
you
could
bring
up
your
pupil
sound
and
robust
to
the
age
of
twelve
years
without
his
knowing
how
to
distinguish
his
right
hand
from
his
left
the
eyes
of
his
understanding
would
from
the
very
first
open
to
reason
without
a
prejudice
or
a
habit
there
would
be
in
him
nothing
to
counteract
the
effect
of
your
care
before
long
he
would
become
in
your
hands
the
wisest
of
men
and
beginning
by
doing
nothing
you
would
have
accomplished
a
marvel
in
education
reverse
the
common
practice
and
you
will
nearly
always
do
well
parents
and
teachers
desiring
to
make
of
a
child
not
a
child
but
a
learned
man
have
never
begun
early
enough
to
chide
to
correct
to
reprimand
to
flatter
to
promise
to
instruct
to
discourse
reason
to
him
do
better
than
this
be
reasonable
yourself
and
do
not
argue
with
your
pupil
least
of
all
to
make
him
approve
what
he
dislikes
for
if
you
persist
in
reasoning
about
disagreeable
things
you
make
reasoning
disagreeable
to
him
and
weaken
its
influence
beforehand
in
a
mind
as
yet
unfitted
to
understand
it
keep
his
organs
his
senses
his
physical
strength
busy
but
as
long
as
possible
keep
his
mind
inactive
guard
against
all
sensations
arising
in
advance
of
judgment
which
estimates
their
true
value
keep
back
and
check
unfamiliar
impressions
and
be
in
no
haste
to
do
good
for
the
sake
of
preventing
evil
for
the
good
is
not
real
unless
enlightened
by
reason
regard
every
delay
as
an
advantage
for
much
is
gained
if
the
critical
period
be
approached
without
losing
anything
let
childhood
have
its
full
growth
if
indeed
a
lesson
must
be
given
avoid
it
if
you
can
without
danger
delay
it
until
another
consideration
which
proves
this
method
useful
is
the
peculiar
bent
of
the
child
mind
this
ought
to
be
well
understood
if
we
would
know
what
moral
government
is
best
adapted
to
him
each
has
his
own
cast
of
mind
in
accordance
with
which
he
must
be
directed
and
if
we
would
succeed
he
must
be
ruled
according
to
this
natural
bent
and
no
other
be
judicious
watch
nature
long
and
observe
your
pupil
carefully
before
you
say
a
word
to
him
at
first
leave
the
germ
of
his
character
free
to
disclose
itself
repress
it
as
little
as
possible
so
that
you
may
the
better
see
all
there
is
of
it
do
you
think
this
season
of
free
action
will
be
time
lost
to
him
on
the
contrary
it
will
be
employed
in
the
best
way
possible
for
by
this
means
you
will
learn
not
to
lose
a
single
moment
when
time
is
more
precious
whereas
if
you
begin
to
act
before
you
know
what
ought
to
be
done
you
act
at
random
liable
to
deceive
yourself
you
will
have
to
retrace
your
steps
and
will
be
farther
from
your
object
than
if
you
had
been
less
in
haste
to
reach
it
do
not
then
act
like
a
miser
who
in
order
to
lose
nothing
loses
a
great
deal
at
the
earlier
age
sacrifice
time
which
you
will
recover
with
interest
later
on
the
wise
physician
does
not
give
directions
at
first
sight
of
his
patient
but
studies
the
sick
man
temperament
before
prescribing
he
begins
late
with
his
treatment
but
cures
the
man
the
physician
kills
him
remember
that
before
you
venture
undertaking
to
form
a
man
you
must
have
made
yourself
a
man
you
must
find
in
yourself
the
example
you
ought
to
offer
him
while
the
child
is
yet
without
knowledge
there
is
time
to
prepare
everything
about
him
so
that
his
first
glance
shall
discover
only
what
he
ought
to
see
make
everybody
respect
you
begin
by
making
yourself
beloved
so
that
everybody
will
try
to
please
you
you
will
not
be
the
child
master
unless
you
are
master
of
everything
around
him
and
this
authority
will
not
suffice
unless
founded
on
esteem
for
virtue
there
is
no
use
in
exhausting
your
purse
by
lavishing
money
i
have
never
observed
that
money
made
any
one
beloved
you
must
not
be
miserly
or
unfeeling
or
lament
the
distress
you
can
relieve
but
you
will
open
your
coffers
in
vain
if
you
do
not
open
your
heart
the
hearts
of
others
will
be
forever
closed
to
you
you
must
give
your
time
your
care
your
affection
yourself
for
whatever
you
may
do
your
money
certainly
is
not
yourself
tokens
of
interest
and
of
kindness
go
farther
and
are
of
more
use
than
any
gifts
whatever
how
many
unhappy
persons
how
many
sufferers
need
consolation
far
more
than
alms
how
many
who
are
oppressed
are
aided
rather
by
protection
than
by
money
reconcile
those
who
are
at
variance
prevent
lawsuits
persuade
children
to
filial
duty
and
parents
to
gentleness
encourage
happy
marriages
hinder
disturbances
use
freely
the
interest
of
your
family
on
behalf
of
the
weak
who
are
denied
justice
and
oppressed
by
the
powerful
boldly
declare
yourself
the
champion
of
the
unfortunate
be
just
humane
beneficent
be
not
content
with
giving
alms
be
charitable
kindness
relieves
more
distress
than
money
can
reach
love
others
and
they
will
love
you
serve
them
and
they
will
serve
you
be
their
brother
and
they
will
be
your
children
blame
others
no
longer
for
the
mischief
you
yourself
are
doing
children
are
less
corrupted
by
the
harm
they
see
than
by
that
you
teach
them
always
preaching
always
moralizing
always
acting
the
pedant
you
give
them
twenty
worthless
ideas
when
you
think
you
are
giving
them
one
good
one
full
of
what
is
passing
in
your
own
mind
you
do
not
see
the
effect
you
are
producing
upon
theirs
in
the
prolonged
torrent
of
words
with
which
you
incessantly
weary
them
do
you
think
there
are
none
they
may
misunderstand
do
you
imagine
that
they
will
not
comment
in
their
own
way
upon
your
wordy
explanations
and
find
in
them
a
system
adapted
to
their
own
capacity
which
if
need
be
they
can
use
against
you
listen
to
a
little
fellow
who
has
just
been
under
instruction
let
him
prattle
question
blunder
just
as
he
pleases
and
you
will
be
surprised
at
the
turn
your
reasonings
have
taken
in
his
mind
he
confounds
one
thing
with
another
he
reverses
everything
he
tires
you
sometimes
worries
you
by
unexpected
objections
he
forces
you
to
hold
your
peace
or
to
make
him
hold
his
and
what
must
he
think
of
this
silence
in
one
so
fond
of
talking
if
ever
he
wins
this
advantage
and
knows
the
fact
farewell
to
his
education
he
will
no
longer
try
to
learn
but
to
refute
what
you
say
be
plain
discreet
reticent
you
who
are
zealous
teachers
be
in
no
haste
to
act
except
to
prevent
others
from
acting
again
and
again
i
say
postpone
even
a
good
lesson
if
you
can
for
fear
of
conveying
a
bad
one
on
this
earth
meant
by
nature
to
be
first
paradise
beware
lest
you
act
the
tempter
by
giving
to
innocence
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
since
you
can
not
prevent
the
learning
from
outside
examples
restrict
your
care
to
the
task
of
impressing
these
examples
on
his
mind
in
suitable
forms
violent
passions
make
a
striking
impression
on
the
child
who
notices
them
because
their
manifestations
are
and
forcibly
attract
his
attention
anger
especially
has
such
stormy
indications
that
its
approach
is
unmistakable
do
not
ask
is
not
this
a
fine
opportunity
for
the
pedagogue
moral
discourse
spare
the
discourse
say
not
a
word
let
the
child
alone
amazed
at
what
he
sees
he
will
not
fail
to
question
you
it
will
not
be
hard
to
answer
him
on
account
of
the
very
things
that
strike
his
senses
he
sees
an
inflamed
countenance
flashing
eyes
threatening
gestures
he
hears
unusually
excited
tones
of
voice
all
sure
signs
that
the
body
is
not
in
its
usual
condition
say
to
him
calmly
unaffectedly
without
any
mystery
this
poor
man
is
sick
he
has
a
high
fever
you
may
take
this
occasion
to
give
him
in
few
words
an
idea
of
maladies
and
of
their
effects
for
these
being
natural
are
trammels
of
that
necessity
to
which
he
has
to
feel
himself
subject
from
this
the
true
idea
will
he
not
early
feel
repugnance
at
giving
way
to
excessive
passion
which
he
regards
as
a
disease
and
do
you
not
think
that
such
an
idea
given
at
the
appropriate
time
will
have
as
good
an
effect
as
the
most
tiresome
sermon
on
morals
note
also
the
future
consequences
of
this
idea
it
will
authorize
you
if
ever
necessity
arises
to
treat
a
rebellious
child
as
a
sick
child
to
confine
him
to
his
room
and
even
to
his
bed
to
make
him
undergo
a
course
of
medical
treatment
to
make
his
growing
vices
alarming
and
hateful
to
himself
he
can
not
consider
as
a
punishment
the
severity
you
are
forced
to
use
in
curing
him
so
that
if
you
yourself
in
some
hasty
moment
are
perhaps
stirred
out
of
the
coolness
and
moderation
it
should
be
your
study
to
preserve
do
not
try
to
disguise
your
fault
but
say
to
him
frankly
in
tender
reproach
my
boy
you
have
hurt
me
i
do
not
intend
to
enter
fully
into
details
but
to
lay
down
some
general
maxims
and
to
illustrate
difficult
cases
i
believe
it
impossible
in
the
very
heart
of
social
surroundings
to
educate
a
child
up
to
the
age
of
twelve
years
without
giving
him
some
ideas
of
the
relations
of
man
to
man
and
of
morality
in
human
actions
it
will
suffice
if
we
put
off
as
long
as
possible
the
necessity
for
these
ideas
and
when
they
must
be
given
limit
them
to
such
as
are
immediately
applicable
we
must
do
this
only
lest
he
consider
himself
master
of
everything
and
so
injure
others
without
scruple
because
unknowingly
there
are
gentle
quiet
characters
who
in
their
early
innocence
may
be
led
a
long
way
without
danger
of
this
kind
but
others
naturally
violent
whose
wildness
is
precocious
must
be
trained
into
men
as
early
as
may
be
that
you
may
not
be
obliged
to
fetter
them
outright
the
idea
of
property
our
first
duties
are
to
ourselves
our
first
feelings
are
concentrated
upon
ourselves
our
first
natural
movements
have
reference
to
our
own
preservation
and
thus
our
first
idea
of
justice
is
not
as
due
from
us
but
to
us
one
error
in
the
education
of
is
that
by
speaking
to
children
first
of
their
duties
and
never
of
their
rights
we
commence
at
the
wrong
end
and
tell
them
of
what
they
can
not
understand
and
what
can
not
interest
them
if
therefore
i
had
to
teach
one
of
these
i
have
mentioned
i
should
reflect
that
a
child
never
attacks
persons
but
things
he
soon
learns
from
experience
to
respect
his
superiors
in
age
and
strength
but
things
do
not
defend
themselves
the
first
idea
to
be
given
him
therefore
is
rather
that
of
property
than
that
of
liberty
and
in
order
to
understand
this
idea
he
must
have
something
of
his
own
to
speak
to
him
of
his
clothes
his
furniture
his
playthings
is
to
tell
him
nothing
at
all
for
though
he
makes
use
of
these
things
he
knows
neither
how
nor
why
he
has
them
to
tell
him
they
are
his
because
they
have
been
given
to
him
is
not
much
better
for
in
order
to
give
we
must
have
this
is
an
ownership
dating
farther
back
than
his
own
and
we
wish
him
to
understand
the
principle
of
ownership
itself
besides
a
gift
is
a
conventional
thing
and
the
child
can
not
as
yet
understand
what
a
conventional
thing
is
you
who
read
this
observe
how
in
this
instance
as
in
a
hundred
thousand
others
a
child
head
is
crammed
with
words
which
from
the
start
have
no
meaning
to
him
but
which
we
imagine
we
have
taught
him
we
must
go
back
then
to
the
origin
of
ownership
for
thence
our
first
ideas
of
it
should
arise
the
child
living
in
the
country
will
have
gained
some
notion
of
what
field
labor
is
having
needed
only
to
use
his
eyes
and
his
abundant
leisure
every
age
in
life
and
especially
his
own
desires
to
create
to
imitate
to
produce
to
manifest
power
and
activity
only
twice
will
it
be
necessary
for
him
to
see
a
garden
cultivated
seed
sown
plants
reared
beans
sprouting
before
he
will
desire
to
work
in
a
garden
himself
in
accordance
with
principles
already
laid
down
i
do
not
at
all
oppose
this
desire
but
encourage
it
i
share
his
taste
i
work
with
him
not
for
his
pleasure
but
for
my
own
at
least
he
thinks
so
i
become
his
assistant
gardener
until
his
arms
are
strong
enough
i
work
the
ground
for
him
by
planting
a
bean
in
it
he
takes
possession
of
it
and
surely
this
possession
is
more
sacred
and
more
to
be
respected
than
that
assumed
by
nuñez
de
balboa
of
south
america
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
spain
by
planting
his
standard
on
the
shores
of
the
pacific
ocean
he
comes
every
day
to
water
the
beans
and
rejoices
to
see
them
thriving
i
add
to
his
delight
by
telling
him
this
belongs
to
you
in
explaining
to
him
what
i
mean
by
belongs
i
make
him
feel
that
he
has
put
into
this
plot
of
ground
his
time
his
labor
his
care
his
bodily
self
that
in
it
is
a
part
of
himself
which
he
may
claim
back
from
any
one
whatever
just
as
he
may
draw
his
own
arm
back
if
another
tries
to
hold
it
against
his
will
one
fine
morning
he
comes
as
usual
running
in
hand
but
oh
what
a
sight
what
a
misfortune
the
beans
are
uprooted
the
garden
bed
is
all
in
disorder
the
place
actually
no
longer
knows
itself
what
has
become
of
my
labor
the
sweet
reward
of
all
my
care
and
toil
who
has
robbed
me
of
my
own
who
has
taken
my
beans
away
from
me
the
little
heart
swells
with
the
bitterness
of
its
first
feeling
of
injustice
his
eyes
overflow
with
tears
his
distress
rends
the
air
with
moans
and
cries
we
compassionate
his
troubles
share
his
indignation
make
inquiries
sift
the
matter
thoroughly
at
last
we
find
that
the
gardener
has
done
the
deed
we
send
for
him
but
we
find
that
we
have
reckoned
without
our
host
when
the
gardener
hears
what
we
are
complaining
of
he
complains
more
than
we
what
so
it
was
you
gentlemen
who
ruined
all
my
labor
i
had
planted
some
maltese
melons
from
seed
given
me
as
a
great
rarity
i
hoped
to
give
you
a
grand
treat
with
them
when
they
were
ripe
but
for
the
sake
of
planting
your
miserable
beans
there
you
killed
my
melons
after
they
had
actually
sprouted
and
there
are
no
more
to
be
had
you
have
done
me
more
harm
than
you
can
remedy
and
you
have
lost
the
pleasure
of
tasting
some
delicious
melons
jean
jacques
excuse
us
my
good
robert
you
put
into
them
your
labor
your
care
i
see
plainly
that
we
did
wrong
to
spoil
your
work
but
we
will
get
you
some
more
maltese
seed
and
we
will
not
till
any
more
ground
without
finding
out
whether
some
one
else
has
put
his
hand
to
it
before
us
robert
oh
well
gentlemen
you
may
as
well
end
the
business
for
there
no
waste
land
what
i
work
was
improved
by
my
father
and
the
same
with
everybody
hereabout
all
the
fields
you
see
were
taken
up
long
ago
émile
robert
do
you
often
lose
your
robert
pardon
my
young
master
we
do
often
have
young
gentlemen
about
that
are
careless
like
you
nobody
touches
his
garden
everybody
respects
other
people
work
to
make
sure
of
his
own
émile
but
i
have
any
garden
robert
what
that
to
me
if
you
spoil
mine
i
wo
let
you
walk
in
it
any
more
for
you
are
to
understand
that
i
not
going
to
have
all
my
pains
for
nothing
jean
jacques
ca
we
arrange
this
matter
with
honest
robert
just
let
my
little
friend
and
me
have
one
corner
of
your
garden
to
cultivate
on
condition
that
you
have
half
the
produce
robert
i
will
let
you
have
it
without
that
condition
but
remember
i
will
root
up
your
beans
if
you
meddle
with
my
melons
in
this
essay
on
the
manner
of
teaching
fundamental
notions
to
children
it
may
be
seen
how
the
idea
of
property
naturally
goes
back
to
the
right
which
the
first
occupant
acquired
by
labor
this
is
clear
concise
simple
and
always
within
the
comprehension
of
the
child
from
this
to
the
right
of
holding
property
and
of
transferring
it
there
is
but
one
step
and
beyond
this
we
are
to
stop
short
it
will
also
be
evident
that
the
explanation
i
have
included
in
two
pages
may
in
actual
practice
be
the
work
of
an
entire
year
for
in
the
development
of
moral
ideas
we
can
not
advance
too
slowly
or
establish
them
too
firmly
at
every
step
i
entreat
you
young
teachers
to
think
of
the
example
i
have
given
and
to
remember
that
your
lessons
upon
every
subject
ought
to
be
rather
in
actions
than
in
words
for
children
readily
forget
what
is
said
or
done
to
them
as
i
have
said
such
lessons
ought
to
be
given
earlier
or
later
as
the
disposition
of
the
child
gentle
or
turbulent
hastens
or
retards
the
necessity
for
giving
them
in
employing
them
we
call
in
an
evidence
that
can
not
be
misunderstood
but
that
in
difficult
cases
nothing
important
may
be
omitted
let
us
give
another
illustration
your
little
meddler
spoils
everything
he
touches
do
not
be
vexed
but
put
out
of
his
reach
whatever
he
can
spoil
he
breaks
the
furniture
he
uses
be
in
no
hurry
to
give
him
any
more
let
him
feel
the
disadvantages
of
doing
without
it
he
breaks
the
windows
in
his
room
let
the
wind
blow
on
him
night
and
day
have
no
fear
of
his
taking
cold
he
had
better
take
cold
than
be
a
fool
do
not
fret
at
the
inconvenience
he
causes
you
but
make
him
feel
it
first
of
all
finally
without
saying
anything
about
it
have
the
panes
of
glass
mended
he
breaks
them
again
change
your
method
say
to
him
coolly
and
without
anger
those
windows
are
mine
i
took
pains
to
have
them
put
there
and
i
am
going
to
make
sure
that
they
shall
not
be
broken
again
then
shut
him
up
in
some
dark
place
where
there
are
no
windows
at
this
novel
proceeding
he
begins
to
cry
and
storm
but
nobody
listens
to
him
he
soon
grows
tired
of
this
and
changes
his
tone
he
complains
and
groans
a
servant
is
sent
whom
the
rebel
entreats
to
set
him
free
without
trying
to
find
any
excuse
for
utter
refusal
the
servant
answers
i
have
windows
to
take
care
of
too
and
goes
away
at
last
after
the
child
has
been
in
durance
for
several
hours
long
enough
to
tire
him
and
to
make
him
remember
it
some
one
suggests
an
arrangement
by
which
you
shall
agree
to
release
him
and
he
to
break
no
more
windows
he
sends
to
beseech
you
to
come
and
see
him
you
come
he
makes
his
proposal
you
accept
it
immediately
saying
well
thought
of
that
will
be
a
good
thing
for
both
of
us
why
did
you
think
of
this
capital
plan
before
then
without
requiring
any
protestations
or
confirmation
of
his
promise
you
gladly
caress
him
and
take
him
to
his
room
at
once
regarding
this
compact
as
sacred
and
inviolable
as
if
ratified
by
an
oath
what
an
idea
of
the
obligation
and
the
usefulness
of
an
engagement
will
he
not
gain
from
this
transaction
i
am
greatly
mistaken
if
there
is
an
unspoiled
child
on
earth
who
would
be
proof
against
it
or
who
would
ever
after
think
of
breaking
a
window
purposely
falsehood
the
force
of
example
we
are
now
within
the
domain
of
morals
and
the
door
is
open
to
vice
side
by
side
with
conventionalities
and
duties
spring
up
deceit
and
falsehood
as
soon
as
there
are
things
we
ought
not
to
do
we
desire
to
hide
what
we
ought
not
to
have
done
as
soon
as
one
interest
leads
us
to
promise
a
stronger
one
may
urge
us
to
break
the
promise
our
chief
concern
is
how
to
break
it
and
still
go
unscathed
it
is
natural
to
find
expedients
we
dissemble
and
we
utter
falsehood
unable
to
prevent
this
evil
we
must
nevertheless
punish
it
thus
the
miseries
of
our
life
arise
from
our
mistakes
i
have
said
enough
to
show
that
punishment
as
such
should
not
be
inflicted
upon
children
but
should
always
happen
to
them
as
the
natural
result
of
their
own
do
not
then
preach
to
them
against
falsehood
or
punish
them
confessedly
on
account
of
a
falsehood
but
if
they
are
guilty
of
one
let
all
its
consequences
fall
heavily
on
their
heads
let
them
know
what
it
is
to
be
disbelieved
even
when
they
speak
the
truth
and
to
be
accused
of
faults
in
spite
of
their
earnest
denial
but
let
us
inquire
what
falsehood
is
in
children
there
are
two
kinds
of
falsehood
that
of
fact
which
refers
to
things
already
past
and
that
of
right
which
has
to
do
with
the
future
the
first
occurs
when
we
deny
doing
what
we
have
done
and
in
general
when
we
knowingly
utter
what
is
not
true
the
other
occurs
when
we
promise
what
we
do
not
mean
to
perform
and
in
general
when
we
express
an
intention
contrary
to
the
one
we
really
have
these
two
sorts
of
untruth
may
sometimes
meet
in
the
same
case
but
let
us
here
discuss
their
points
of
difference
one
who
realizes
his
need
of
help
from
others
and
constantly
receives
kindness
from
them
has
nothing
to
gain
by
deceiving
them
on
the
contrary
it
is
evidently
his
interest
that
they
should
see
things
as
they
are
lest
they
make
mistakes
to
his
disadvantage
it
is
clear
then
that
the
falsehood
of
fact
is
not
natural
to
children
but
the
law
of
obedience
makes
falsehood
necessary
because
obedience
being
irksome
we
secretly
avoid
it
whenever
we
can
and
just
in
proportion
as
the
immediate
advantage
of
escaping
reproof
or
punishment
outweighs
the
remoter
advantage
to
be
gained
by
revealing
the
truth
why
should
a
child
educated
naturally
and
in
perfect
freedom
tell
a
falsehood
what
has
he
to
hide
from
you
you
are
not
going
to
reprove
or
punish
him
or
exact
anything
from
him
why
should
he
not
tell
you
everything
as
frankly
as
to
his
little
playmate
he
sees
no
more
danger
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
the
falsehood
of
right
is
still
less
natural
to
children
because
promises
to
do
or
not
to
do
are
conventional
acts
foreign
to
our
nature
and
infringements
of
our
liberty
besides
all
the
engagements
of
children
are
in
themselves
void
because
as
their
limited
vision
does
not
stretch
beyond
the
present
they
know
not
what
they
do
when
they
bind
themselves
it
is
hardly
possible
for
a
child
to
tell
a
lie
in
making
a
promise
for
considering
only
how
to
overcome
a
present
difficulty
all
devices
that
have
no
immediate
effect
become
alike
to
him
in
promising
for
a
time
to
come
he
actually
does
not
promise
at
all
as
his
still
dormant
imagination
can
not
extend
itself
over
two
different
periods
of
time
if
he
could
escape
a
whipping
or
earn
some
by
promising
to
throw
himself
out
of
the
window
he
would
at
once
promise
it
therefore
the
laws
pay
no
regard
to
engagements
made
by
children
and
when
some
fathers
and
teachers
more
strict
than
this
require
the
fulfilling
of
such
engagements
it
is
only
in
things
the
child
ought
to
do
without
promising
as
the
child
in
making
a
promise
is
not
aware
what
he
is
doing
he
can
not
be
guilty
of
falsehood
in
so
doing
but
this
is
not
the
case
when
he
breaks
a
promise
for
he
well
remembers
having
made
the
promise
what
he
can
not
understand
is
the
importance
of
keeping
it
unable
to
read
the
future
he
does
not
foresee
the
consequences
of
his
actions
and
when
he
violates
engagements
he
does
nothing
contrary
to
what
might
be
expected
of
his
years
it
follows
from
this
that
all
the
untruths
spoken
by
children
are
the
fault
of
those
who
instruct
them
and
that
endeavoring
to
teach
them
how
to
be
truthful
is
only
teaching
them
how
to
tell
falsehoods
we
are
so
eager
to
regulate
to
govern
to
instruct
them
that
we
never
find
means
enough
to
reach
our
object
we
want
to
win
new
victories
over
their
minds
by
maxims
not
based
upon
fact
by
unreasonable
precepts
we
would
rather
they
should
know
their
lessons
and
tell
lies
than
to
remain
ignorant
and
speak
the
truth
as
for
us
who
give
our
pupils
none
but
practical
teaching
and
would
rather
have
them
good
than
knowing
we
shall
not
exact
the
truth
from
them
at
all
lest
they
disguise
it
we
will
require
of
them
no
promises
they
may
be
tempted
to
break
if
in
my
absence
some
anonymous
mischief
has
been
done
i
will
beware
of
accusing
émile
or
of
asking
was
it
you
for
what
would
that
be
but
teaching
him
to
deny
it
if
his
naturally
troublesome
disposition
obliges
me
to
make
some
agreement
with
him
i
will
plan
so
well
that
any
such
proposal
shall
come
from
him
and
never
from
me
thus
whenever
he
is
bound
by
an
engagement
he
shall
have
an
immediate
and
tangible
interest
in
fulfilling
it
and
if
he
ever
fails
in
this
the
falsehood
shall
bring
upon
him
evil
results
which
he
sees
must
arise
from
the
very
nature
of
things
and
never
from
the
vengeance
of
his
tutor
far
from
needing
recourse
to
such
severe
measures
however
i
am
almost
sure
that
émile
will
be
long
in
learning
what
a
lie
is
and
upon
finding
it
out
will
be
greatly
amazed
not
understanding
what
is
to
be
gained
by
it
it
is
very
plain
that
the
more
i
make
his
welfare
independent
of
either
the
will
or
the
judgment
of
others
the
more
i
uproot
within
him
all
interest
in
telling
falsehoods
when
we
are
less
eager
to
instruct
we
are
also
less
eager
to
exact
requirements
from
our
pupil
and
can
take
time
to
require
only
what
is
to
the
purpose
in
that
case
the
child
will
be
developed
just
because
he
is
not
spoiled
but
when
some
blockhead
teacher
not
understanding
what
he
is
about
continually
forces
the
child
to
promise
things
making
no
distinctions
allowing
no
choice
knowing
no
limit
the
little
fellow
worried
and
weighed
down
with
all
these
obligations
neglects
them
forgets
them
at
last
despises
them
and
considering
them
mere
empty
formulas
turns
the
giving
and
the
breaking
of
them
into
ridicule
if
then
you
want
to
make
him
faithful
to
his
word
be
discreet
in
requiring
him
to
give
it
the
details
just
entered
upon
in
regard
to
falsehood
may
apply
in
many
respects
to
all
duties
which
when
enjoined
upon
children
become
to
them
not
only
hateful
but
impracticable
in
order
to
seem
to
preach
virtue
we
make
vices
attractive
and
actually
impart
them
by
forbidding
them
if
we
would
have
the
children
religious
we
tire
them
out
taking
them
to
church
by
making
them
mumble
prayers
incessantly
we
make
them
sigh
for
the
happiness
of
never
praying
at
all
to
inspire
charity
in
them
we
make
them
give
alms
as
if
we
disdained
doing
it
ourselves
it
is
not
the
child
but
his
teacher
who
ought
to
do
the
giving
however
much
you
love
your
pupil
this
is
an
honor
you
ought
to
dispute
with
him
leading
him
to
feel
that
he
is
not
yet
old
enough
to
deserve
it
giving
alms
is
the
act
of
one
who
knows
the
worth
of
his
gift
and
his
need
of
the
gift
a
child
who
knows
nothing
of
either
can
have
no
merit
in
bestowing
he
gives
without
charity
or
benevolence
he
is
almost
ashamed
to
give
at
all
as
judging
from
your
example
and
his
own
only
children
give
alms
and
leave
it
off
when
grown
up
observe
that
we
make
the
child
bestow
only
things
whose
value
be
does
not
know
pieces
of
metal
which
he
carries
in
his
pocket
and
which
are
good
for
nothing
else
a
child
would
rather
give
away
a
hundred
gold
pieces
than
a
single
cake
but
suggest
to
this
giver
the
idea
of
parting
with
what
he
really
prizes
his
playthings
his
or
his
luncheon
you
will
soon
find
out
whether
you
have
made
him
really
generous
to
accomplish
the
same
end
resort
is
had
to
another
expedient
that
of
instantly
returning
to
the
child
what
he
has
given
away
so
that
he
habitually
gives
whatever
he
knows
will
be
restored
to
him
i
have
rarely
met
with
other
than
these
two
kinds
of
generosity
in
children
namely
the
giving
either
of
what
is
no
use
to
themselves
or
else
of
what
they
are
certain
will
come
back
to
them
do
this
says
locke
that
they
may
be
convinced
by
experience
that
he
who
gives
most
generously
has
always
the
better
portion
this
is
making
him
liberal
in
appearance
and
miserly
in
reality
he
adds
that
children
will
thus
acquire
the
habit
of
generosity
yes
a
miser
generosity
giving
an
egg
to
gain
an
ox
but
when
called
upon
to
be
generous
in
earnest
to
the
habit
they
soon
cease
giving
when
the
gift
no
longer
comes
back
to
them
we
ought
to
keep
in
view
the
habit
of
mind
rather
than
that
of
the
hands
like
this
virtue
are
all
others
taught
to
children
and
their
early
years
are
spent
in
sadness
that
we
may
preach
these
sterling
virtues
to
them
excellent
training
this
lay
aside
all
affectation
you
teachers
be
yourselves
good
and
virtuous
so
that
your
example
may
be
deeply
graven
on
your
memory
until
such
time
as
it
finds
lodgment
in
their
heart
instead
of
early
requiring
acts
of
charity
from
my
pupil
i
would
rather
do
them
in
his
presence
taking
from
him
all
means
of
imitating
me
as
if
i
considered
it
an
honor
not
due
to
his
age
for
he
should
by
no
means
be
in
the
habit
of
thinking
a
man
duties
the
same
as
a
child
seeing
me
assist
the
poor
he
questions
me
about
it
and
if
occasion
serve
i
answer
my
boy
it
is
because
since
poor
people
are
willing
there
should
be
rich
people
the
rich
have
promised
to
take
care
of
those
who
have
no
money
or
can
not
earn
a
living
by
their
labor
and
have
you
promised
it
too
inquires
he
of
course
the
money
that
comes
into
my
hands
is
mine
to
use
only
upon
this
condition
which
its
owner
has
to
carry
out
after
this
conversation
and
we
have
seen
how
a
child
may
be
prepared
to
understand
it
other
children
besides
émile
would
be
tempted
to
imitate
me
by
acting
like
a
rich
man
in
this
case
i
would
at
least
see
that
it
should
not
be
done
ostentatiously
i
would
rather
have
him
rob
me
of
my
right
and
conceal
the
fact
of
his
generosity
it
would
be
a
stratagem
natural
at
his
age
and
the
only
one
i
would
pardon
in
him
the
only
moral
lesson
suited
to
childhood
and
the
most
important
at
any
age
is
never
to
injure
any
one
even
the
principle
of
doing
good
if
not
subordinated
to
this
is
dangerous
false
and
contradictory
for
who
does
not
do
good
everybody
does
even
a
wicked
man
who
makes
one
happy
at
the
expense
of
making
a
hundred
miserable
and
thence
arise
all
our
calamities
the
most
exalted
virtues
are
negative
they
are
hardest
to
attain
too
because
they
are
unostentatious
and
rise
above
even
that
gratification
dear
to
the
heart
of
man
sending
another
person
away
pleased
with
us
if
there
be
a
man
who
never
injures
one
of
his
what
good
must
he
achieve
for
them
what
fearlessness
what
vigor
of
mind
he
requires
for
it
not
by
reasoning
about
this
principle
but
by
attempting
to
carry
it
into
practice
do
we
find
out
how
great
it
is
how
hard
to
fulfil
the
foregoing
conveys
some
faint
idea
of
the
precautions
i
would
have
you
employ
in
giving
children
the
instructions
we
sometimes
can
not
withhold
without
risk
of
their
injuring
themselves
or
others
and
especially
of
contracting
bad
habits
of
which
it
will
by
and
by
be
difficult
to
break
them
but
we
may
rest
assured
that
in
children
rightly
educated
the
necessity
will
seldom
arise
for
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
become
intractable
vicious
deceitful
greedy
unless
the
vices
which
make
them
so
are
sowed
in
their
hearts
for
this
reason
what
has
been
said
on
this
point
applies
rather
to
exceptional
than
to
ordinary
cases
but
such
exceptional
cases
become
common
in
proportion
as
children
have
more
frequent
opportunity
to
depart
from
their
natural
state
and
to
acquire
the
vices
of
their
seniors
those
brought
up
among
men
of
the
world
absolutely
require
earlier
teaching
in
these
matters
than
those
educated
apart
from
such
surroundings
hence
this
private
education
is
to
be
preferred
even
if
it
do
no
more
than
allow
childhood
leisure
to
grow
to
perfection
negative
or
temporizing
education
exactly
contrary
to
the
cases
just
described
are
those
whom
a
happy
temperament
exalts
above
their
years
as
there
are
some
men
who
never
outgrow
childhood
so
there
are
others
who
never
pass
through
it
but
are
men
almost
from
their
birth
the
difficulty
is
that
these
exceptional
cases
are
rare
and
not
easily
distinguished
besides
all
mothers
capable
of
understanding
that
a
child
can
be
a
prodigy
have
no
doubt
that
their
own
are
such
they
go
even
farther
than
this
they
take
for
extraordinary
indications
the
sprightliness
the
bright
childish
pranks
and
sayings
the
shrewd
simplicity
of
ordinary
cases
characteristic
of
that
time
of
life
and
showing
plainly
that
a
child
is
only
a
child
is
it
surprising
that
allowed
to
speak
so
much
and
so
freely
unrestrained
by
any
consideration
of
propriety
a
child
should
occasionally
make
happy
replies
if
he
did
not
it
would
be
even
more
surprising
just
as
if
an
astrologer
among
a
hundred
false
predictions
should
never
hit
upon
a
single
true
one
they
lie
so
often
said
henry
that
they
end
by
telling
the
truth
to
be
a
wit
one
need
only
utter
a
great
many
foolish
speeches
heaven
help
men
of
fashion
whose
reputation
rests
upon
just
this
foundation
the
most
brilliant
thoughts
may
enter
a
child
head
or
rather
the
most
brilliant
sayings
may
fall
from
his
lips
just
as
the
most
valuable
diamonds
may
fall
into
his
hands
without
his
having
any
right
either
to
the
thoughts
or
to
the
diamonds
at
his
age
he
has
no
real
property
of
any
kind
a
child
utterances
are
not
the
same
to
him
as
to
us
he
does
not
attach
to
them
the
same
ideas
if
he
has
any
ideas
at
all
on
the
subject
they
have
neither
order
nor
coherence
in
his
mind
in
all
his
thoughts
nothing
is
certain
or
stable
if
you
watch
your
supposed
prodigy
attentively
you
will
sometimes
find
him
a
of
energy
penetrating
the
very
marrow
of
things
much
oftener
the
same
mind
appears
commonplace
dull
and
as
if
enveloped
in
a
dense
fog
sometimes
he
outruns
you
and
sometimes
he
stands
still
at
one
moment
you
feel
like
saying
he
is
a
genius
and
at
another
he
is
a
fool
you
are
mistaken
in
either
case
he
is
a
child
he
is
an
eaglet
that
one
moment
beats
the
air
with
its
wings
and
the
next
moment
falls
back
into
the
nest
in
spite
of
appearances
then
treat
him
as
his
age
demands
and
beware
lest
you
exhaust
his
powers
by
attempting
to
use
them
too
freely
if
this
young
brain
grows
warm
if
you
see
it
beginning
to
seethe
leave
it
free
to
ferment
but
do
not
excite
it
lest
it
melt
altogether
into
air
when
the
first
flow
of
spirits
has
evaporated
repress
and
keep
within
bounds
the
rest
until
as
time
goes
on
the
whole
is
transformed
into
warmth
and
real
power
otherwise
you
will
lose
both
time
and
pains
you
will
destroy
your
own
handiwork
and
after
having
thoughtlessly
intoxicated
yourself
with
all
these
inflammable
vapors
you
will
have
nothing
left
but
the
dregs
nothing
has
been
more
generally
or
certainly
observed
than
that
dull
children
make
commonplace
men
in
childhood
it
is
very
difficult
to
distinguish
real
dullness
from
that
misleading
apparent
dullness
which
indicates
a
strong
character
at
first
it
seems
strange
that
the
two
extremes
should
meet
in
indications
so
much
alike
and
yet
such
is
the
case
for
at
an
age
when
man
has
no
real
ideas
at
all
the
difference
between
one
who
has
genius
and
one
who
has
not
is
that
the
latter
entertains
only
mistaken
ideas
and
the
former
encountering
only
such
admits
none
at
all
the
two
are
therefore
alike
in
this
that
the
dullard
is
capable
of
nothing
and
the
other
finds
nothing
to
suit
him
the
only
means
of
distinguishing
them
is
chance
which
may
bring
to
the
genius
some
ideas
he
can
comprehend
while
the
dull
mind
is
always
the
same
during
his
childhood
the
younger
cato
was
at
home
considered
an
idiot
no
one
said
anything
of
him
beyond
that
he
was
silent
and
headstrong
it
was
only
in
the
antechamber
of
sulla
that
his
uncle
learned
to
know
him
if
he
had
never
crossed
its
threshold
he
might
have
been
thought
a
fool
until
he
was
grown
if
there
had
been
no
such
person
as
caesar
this
very
cato
who
read
the
secret
of
caesar
fatal
genius
and
from
afar
foresaw
his
ambitious
designs
would
always
have
been
treated
as
a
visionary
those
who
judge
of
children
so
hastily
are
very
liable
to
be
mistaken
they
are
often
more
childish
than
the
children
themselves
concerning
the
memory
respect
children
and
be
in
no
haste
to
judge
their
actions
good
or
evil
let
the
exceptional
cases
show
themselves
such
for
some
time
before
you
adopt
special
methods
of
dealing
with
them
let
nature
be
long
at
work
before
you
attempt
to
supplant
her
lest
you
thwart
her
work
you
say
you
know
how
precious
time
is
and
do
not
wish
to
lose
it
do
you
not
know
that
to
employ
it
badly
is
to
waste
it
still
more
and
that
a
child
badly
taught
is
farther
from
being
wise
than
one
not
taught
at
all
you
are
troubled
at
seeing
him
spend
his
early
years
in
doing
nothing
what
is
it
nothing
to
be
happy
is
it
nothing
to
skip
to
play
to
run
about
all
day
long
never
in
all
his
life
will
he
be
so
busy
as
now
plato
in
that
work
of
his
considered
so
severe
the
republic
would
have
children
accustomed
to
festivals
games
songs
and
pastimes
one
would
think
he
was
satisfied
with
having
carefully
taught
them
how
to
enjoy
themselves
and
seneca
speaking
of
the
roman
youth
of
old
says
they
were
always
standing
nothing
was
taught
them
that
they
had
to
learn
when
seated
were
they
of
less
account
when
they
reached
manhood
have
no
fear
then
of
this
supposed
idleness
what
would
you
think
of
a
man
who
in
order
to
use
his
whole
life
to
the
best
advantage
would
not
sleep
you
would
say
the
man
has
no
sense
he
does
not
enjoy
life
but
robs
himself
of
it
to
avoid
sleep
he
rushes
on
his
death
the
two
cases
are
parallel
for
childhood
is
the
slumber
of
reason
apparent
quickness
in
learning
is
the
ruin
of
children
we
do
not
consider
that
this
very
quickness
proves
that
they
are
learning
nothing
their
smooth
and
polished
brain
reflects
like
a
mirror
the
objects
presented
to
it
but
nothing
abides
there
nothing
penetrates
it
the
child
retains
the
words
the
ideas
are
reflected
they
who
hear
understand
them
but
he
himself
does
not
understand
them
at
all
although
memory
and
reason
are
two
essentially
different
faculties
the
one
is
never
really
developed
without
the
other
before
the
age
of
reason
the
child
receives
not
ideas
but
images
there
is
this
difference
between
the
two
that
images
are
only
absolute
representations
of
objects
of
sense
and
ideas
are
notions
of
objects
determined
by
their
relations
an
image
may
exist
alone
in
the
mind
that
represents
it
but
every
idea
supposes
other
ideas
when
we
imagine
we
only
see
when
we
conceive
of
things
we
compare
them
our
sensations
are
entirely
passive
whereas
all
our
perceptions
or
ideas
spring
from
an
active
principle
which
judges
i
say
then
that
children
incapable
of
judging
really
have
no
memory
they
retain
sounds
shapes
sensations
but
rarely
ideas
and
still
more
rarely
the
relations
of
ideas
to
one
another
if
this
statement
is
apparently
refuted
by
the
objection
that
they
learn
some
elements
of
geometry
it
is
not
really
true
that
very
fact
confirms
my
statement
it
shows
that
far
from
knowing
how
to
reason
themselves
they
can
not
even
keep
in
mind
the
reasonings
of
others
for
if
you
investigate
the
method
of
these
little
geometricians
you
discover
at
once
that
they
have
retained
only
the
exact
impression
of
the
diagram
and
the
words
of
the
demonstration
upon
the
least
new
objection
they
are
puzzled
their
knowledge
is
only
of
the
sensation
nothing
has
become
the
property
of
their
understanding
even
their
memory
is
rarely
more
perfect
than
their
other
faculties
for
when
grown
they
have
nearly
always
to
learn
again
as
realities
things
whose
names
they
learned
in
childhood
however
i
am
far
from
thinking
that
children
have
no
power
of
reasoning
whatever
i
observe
on
the
contrary
that
in
things
they
understand
things
relating
to
their
present
and
manifest
interests
they
reason
extremely
well
we
are
however
liable
to
be
misled
as
to
their
knowledge
attributing
to
them
what
they
do
not
have
and
making
them
reason
about
what
they
do
not
understand
again
we
make
the
mistake
of
calling
their
attention
to
considerations
by
which
they
are
in
no
wise
affected
such
as
their
future
interests
the
happiness
of
their
coming
manhood
the
opinion
people
will
have
of
them
when
they
are
grown
up
such
speeches
addressed
to
minds
entirely
without
foresight
are
absolutely
unmeaning
now
all
the
studies
forced
upon
these
poor
unfortunates
deal
with
things
like
this
utterly
foreign
to
their
minds
you
may
judge
what
attention
such
subjects
are
likely
to
receive
on
the
study
of
words
pedagogues
who
make
such
an
imposing
display
of
what
they
teach
are
paid
to
talk
in
another
strain
than
mine
but
their
conduct
shows
that
they
think
as
i
do
for
after
all
what
do
they
teach
their
pupils
words
words
words
among
all
their
boasted
subjects
none
are
selected
because
they
are
useful
such
would
be
the
sciences
of
things
in
which
these
professors
are
unskilful
but
they
prefer
sciences
we
seem
to
know
when
we
know
their
nomenclature
such
as
heraldry
geography
chronology
languages
studies
so
far
removed
from
human
interests
and
particularly
from
the
child
that
it
would
be
wonderful
if
any
of
them
could
be
of
the
least
use
at
any
time
in
life
it
may
cause
surprise
that
i
account
the
study
of
languages
one
of
the
useless
things
in
education
but
remember
i
am
speaking
of
the
studies
of
earlier
years
and
whatever
may
be
said
i
do
not
believe
that
any
child
except
a
prodigy
will
ever
learn
two
languages
by
the
time
he
is
twelve
or
fifteen
i
admit
that
if
the
study
of
languages
were
only
that
of
words
that
is
of
forms
and
of
the
sounds
which
express
them
it
might
be
suitable
for
children
but
languages
by
changing
their
signs
modify
also
the
ideas
they
represent
minds
are
formed
upon
languages
thoughts
take
coloring
from
idioms
reason
alone
is
common
to
all
in
each
language
the
mind
has
its
peculiar
conformation
and
this
may
be
in
part
the
cause
or
the
effect
of
national
character
the
fact
that
every
nation
language
follows
the
vicissitudes
of
that
morals
and
is
preserved
or
altered
with
them
seems
to
confirm
this
theory
of
these
different
forms
custom
gives
one
to
the
child
and
it
is
the
only
one
he
retains
until
the
age
of
reason
in
order
to
have
two
he
must
be
able
to
compare
ideas
and
how
can
he
do
this
when
he
is
scarcely
able
to
grasp
them
each
object
may
for
him
have
a
thousand
different
signs
but
each
idea
can
have
but
one
form
he
can
therefore
learn
to
speak
only
one
language
it
is
nevertheless
maintained
that
he
learns
several
this
i
deny
i
have
seen
little
prodigies
who
thought
they
could
speak
six
or
seven
i
have
heard
them
speak
german
in
latin
french
and
italian
idioms
successively
they
did
indeed
use
five
or
six
vocabularies
but
they
never
spoke
anything
but
german
in
short
you
may
give
children
as
many
synonyms
as
you
please
and
you
will
change
only
their
words
and
not
their
language
they
will
never
know
more
than
one
to
hide
this
inability
we
by
preference
give
them
practice
in
the
dead
languages
of
which
there
are
no
longer
any
unexceptionable
judges
the
familiar
use
of
these
tongues
having
long
been
lost
we
content
ourselves
with
imitating
what
we
find
of
them
in
books
and
call
this
speaking
them
if
such
be
the
greek
and
latin
of
the
masters
you
may
judge
what
that
of
the
children
is
scarcely
have
they
learned
by
heart
the
rudiments
without
in
the
least
understanding
them
before
they
are
taught
to
utter
a
french
discourse
in
latin
words
and
when
further
advanced
to
string
together
in
prose
phrases
from
cicero
and
cantos
from
virgil
then
they
imagine
they
are
speaking
latin
and
who
is
there
to
contradict
them
in
any
study
words
that
represent
things
are
nothing
without
the
ideas
of
the
things
they
represent
we
however
limit
children
to
these
signs
without
ever
being
able
to
make
them
understand
the
things
represented
we
think
we
are
teaching
a
child
the
description
of
the
earth
when
he
is
merely
learning
maps
we
teach
him
the
names
of
cities
countries
rivers
he
has
no
idea
that
they
exist
anywhere
but
on
the
map
we
use
in
pointing
them
out
to
him
i
recollect
seeing
somewhere
a
on
geography
which
began
thus
what
is
the
world
a
pasteboard
globe
precisely
such
is
the
geography
of
children
i
will
venture
to
say
that
after
two
years
of
globes
and
cosmography
no
child
of
ten
by
rules
they
give
him
could
find
the
way
from
paris
to
denis
i
maintain
that
not
one
of
them
from
a
plan
of
his
father
garden
could
trace
out
its
windings
without
going
astray
and
yet
these
are
the
knowing
creatures
who
can
tell
you
exactly
where
pekin
ispahan
mexico
and
all
the
countries
of
the
world
are
i
hear
it
suggested
that
children
ought
to
be
engaged
in
studies
in
which
only
the
eye
is
needed
this
might
be
true
if
there
were
studies
in
which
their
eyes
were
not
needed
but
i
know
of
none
such
a
still
more
ridiculous
method
obliges
children
to
study
history
supposed
to
be
within
their
comprehension
because
it
is
only
a
collection
of
facts
but
what
do
we
mean
by
facts
do
we
suppose
that
the
relations
out
of
which
historic
facts
grow
are
so
easily
understood
that
the
minds
of
children
grasp
such
ideas
without
difficulty
do
we
imagine
that
the
true
understanding
of
events
can
be
separated
from
that
of
their
causes
and
effects
and
that
the
historic
and
the
moral
are
so
far
asunder
that
the
one
can
be
understood
without
the
other
if
in
men
actions
you
see
only
purely
external
and
physical
changes
what
do
you
learn
from
history
absolutely
nothing
and
the
subject
despoiled
of
all
interest
no
longer
gives
you
either
pleasure
or
instruction
if
you
intend
to
estimate
actions
by
their
moral
relations
try
to
make
your
pupils
understand
these
relations
and
you
will
discover
whether
history
is
adapted
to
their
years
if
there
is
no
science
in
words
there
is
no
study
especially
adapted
to
children
if
they
have
no
real
ideas
they
have
no
real
memory
for
i
do
not
call
that
memory
which
retains
only
impressions
of
what
use
is
it
to
write
on
their
minds
a
catalogue
of
signs
that
represent
nothing
to
them
in
learning
the
things
represented
would
they
not
also
learn
the
signs
why
do
you
give
them
the
useless
trouble
of
learning
them
twice
besides
you
create
dangerous
prejudices
by
making
them
suppose
that
science
consists
of
words
meaningless
to
them
the
first
mere
word
with
which
the
child
satisfies
himself
the
first
thing
he
learns
on
the
authority
of
another
person
ruins
his
judgment
long
must
he
shine
in
the
eyes
of
unthinking
persons
before
he
can
repair
such
an
injury
to
himself
no
nature
makes
the
child
brain
so
yielding
that
it
receives
all
kinds
of
impressions
not
that
we
may
make
his
childhood
a
distressing
burden
to
him
by
engraving
on
that
brain
dates
names
of
kings
technical
terms
in
heraldry
mathematics
geography
and
all
such
words
unmeaning
to
him
and
unnecessary
to
persons
at
any
age
in
life
but
all
ideas
that
he
can
understand
and
that
are
of
use
to
him
all
that
conduce
to
his
happiness
and
that
will
one
day
make
his
duties
plain
should
early
write
themselves
there
indelibly
to
guide
him
through
life
as
his
condition
and
his
intellect
require
the
memory
of
which
a
child
is
capable
is
far
from
inactive
even
without
the
use
of
books
all
he
sees
and
hears
impresses
him
and
he
remembers
it
he
keeps
a
mental
register
of
people
sayings
and
doings
everything
around
him
is
the
book
from
which
he
is
continually
but
unconsciously
enriching
his
memory
against
the
time
his
judgment
can
benefit
by
it
if
we
intend
rightly
to
cultivate
this
chief
faculty
of
the
mind
we
must
choose
these
objects
carefully
constantly
acquainting
him
with
such
as
he
ought
to
understand
and
keeping
back
those
he
ought
not
to
know
in
this
way
we
should
endeavor
to
make
his
mind
a
storehouse
of
knowledge
to
aid
in
his
education
in
youth
and
to
direct
him
at
all
times
this
method
does
not
it
is
true
produce
phenomenal
children
nor
does
it
make
the
reputation
of
their
teachers
but
it
produces
judicious
robust
men
sound
in
body
and
in
mind
who
although
not
admired
in
youth
will
make
themselves
respected
in
manhood
émile
shall
never
learn
anything
by
heart
not
even
fables
such
as
those
of
la
fontaine
simple
and
charming
as
they
are
for
the
words
of
fables
are
no
more
the
fables
themselves
than
the
words
of
history
are
history
itself
how
can
we
be
so
blind
as
to
call
fables
moral
lessons
for
children
we
do
not
reflect
that
while
these
stories
amuse
they
also
mislead
children
who
carried
away
by
the
fiction
miss
the
truth
conveyed
so
that
what
makes
the
lesson
agreeable
also
makes
it
less
profitable
men
may
learn
from
fables
but
children
must
be
told
the
bare
truth
if
it
be
veiled
they
do
not
trouble
themselves
to
lift
the
veil
since
nothing
ought
to
be
required
of
children
merely
in
proof
of
their
obedience
it
follows
that
they
can
learn
nothing
of
which
they
can
not
understand
the
actual
and
immediate
advantage
whether
it
be
pleasant
or
useful
otherwise
what
motive
will
induce
them
to
learn
it
the
art
of
conversing
with
absent
persons
and
of
hearing
from
them
of
communicating
to
them
at
a
distance
without
the
aid
of
another
our
feelings
intentions
and
wishes
is
an
art
whose
value
may
be
explained
to
children
of
almost
any
age
whatever
by
what
astonishing
process
has
this
useful
and
agreeable
art
become
so
irksome
to
them
they
have
been
forced
to
learn
it
in
spite
of
themselves
and
to
use
it
in
ways
they
can
not
understand
a
child
is
not
anxious
to
perfect
the
instrument
used
in
tormenting
him
but
make
the
same
thing
minister
to
his
pleasures
and
you
can
not
prevent
him
from
using
it
much
attention
is
paid
to
finding
out
the
best
methods
of
teaching
children
to
read
we
invent
and
charts
we
turn
a
child
room
into
a
printer
establishment
locke
proposes
teaching
children
to
read
by
means
of
dice
a
brilliant
contrivance
indeed
but
a
mistake
as
well
a
better
thing
than
all
these
a
thing
no
one
thinks
of
is
the
desire
to
learn
give
a
child
this
desire
and
you
will
not
need
dice
or
reading
lotteries
any
device
will
serve
as
well
if
on
the
plan
i
have
begun
to
lay
down
you
follow
rules
exactly
contrary
to
those
most
in
fashion
you
will
not
attract
and
bewilder
your
pupil
attention
by
distant
places
climates
and
ages
of
the
world
going
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
into
the
very
heavens
themselves
but
will
make
a
point
of
keeping
it
fixed
upon
himself
and
what
immediately
concerns
him
and
by
this
plan
you
will
find
him
capable
of
perception
memory
and
even
reasoning
this
is
the
order
of
nature
in
proportion
as
a
creature
endowed
with
sensation
becomes
active
it
acquires
discernment
suited
to
its
powers
and
the
surplus
of
strength
needed
to
preserve
it
is
absolutely
necessary
in
developing
that
speculative
faculty
which
uses
the
same
surplus
for
other
ends
if
then
you
mean
to
cultivate
your
pupil
understanding
cultivate
the
strength
it
is
intended
to
govern
give
him
constant
physical
exercise
make
his
body
sound
and
robust
that
you
may
make
him
wise
and
reasonable
let
him
be
at
work
doing
something
let
him
run
shout
be
always
in
motion
let
him
be
a
man
in
vigor
and
he
will
the
sooner
become
one
in
reason
you
would
indeed
make
a
mere
animal
of
him
by
this
method
if
you
are
continually
directing
him
and
saying
go
come
stay
do
this
stop
doing
that
if
your
head
is
always
to
guide
his
arm
his
own
head
will
be
of
no
use
to
him
but
recollect
our
agreement
if
you
are
a
mere
pedant
there
is
no
use
in
your
reading
what
i
write
to
imagine
that
physical
exercise
injures
mental
operations
is
a
wretched
mistake
the
two
should
move
in
unison
and
one
ought
to
regulate
the
other
my
pupil
or
rather
nature
pupil
trained
from
the
first
to
depend
as
much
as
possible
on
himself
is
not
continually
running
to
others
for
advice
still
less
does
he
make
a
display
of
his
knowledge
on
the
other
hand
he
judges
he
foresees
he
reasons
upon
everything
that
immediately
concerns
him
he
does
not
prate
but
acts
he
is
little
informed
as
to
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
but
knows
very
well
what
he
ought
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
incessantly
in
motion
he
can
not
avoid
observing
many
things
and
knowing
many
effects
he
early
gains
a
wide
experience
and
takes
his
lessons
from
nature
not
from
men
he
instructs
himself
all
the
better
for
discovering
nowhere
any
intention
of
instructing
him
thus
at
the
same
time
body
and
mind
are
exercised
always
carrying
out
his
own
ideas
and
not
another
person
two
processes
are
simultaneously
going
on
within
him
as
he
grows
robust
and
strong
he
becomes
intelligent
and
judicious
in
this
way
he
will
one
day
have
those
two
excellences
thought
incompatible
indeed
but
characteristic
of
nearly
all
great
men
strength
of
body
and
strength
of
mind
the
reason
of
a
sage
and
the
vigor
of
an
athlete
i
am
recommending
a
difficult
art
to
you
young
teacher
the
art
of
governing
without
rules
and
of
doing
everything
by
doing
nothing
at
all
i
grant
that
at
your
age
this
art
is
not
to
be
expected
of
you
it
will
not
enable
you
at
the
outset
to
exhibit
your
shining
talents
or
to
make
yourself
prized
by
parents
but
it
is
the
only
one
that
will
succeed
to
be
a
sensible
man
your
pupil
must
first
have
been
a
little
scapegrace
the
spartans
were
educated
in
this
way
not
tied
down
to
books
but
obliged
to
steal
their
dinners
and
did
this
produce
men
inferior
in
understanding
who
does
not
remember
their
forcible
pithy
sayings
trained
to
conquer
they
worsted
their
enemies
in
every
kind
of
encounter
and
the
babbling
athenians
dreaded
their
sharp
speeches
quite
as
much
as
their
valor
in
stricter
systems
of
education
the
teacher
commands
and
thinks
he
is
governing
the
child
who
is
after
all
the
real
master
what
you
exact
from
him
he
employs
as
means
to
get
from
you
what
he
wants
by
one
hour
of
diligence
he
can
buy
a
week
indulgence
at
every
moment
you
have
to
make
terms
with
him
these
bargains
which
you
propose
in
your
way
and
which
he
fulfils
in
his
own
way
always
turn
out
to
the
advantage
of
his
whims
especially
when
you
are
so
careless
as
to
make
stipulations
which
will
be
to
his
advantage
whether
he
carries
out
his
share
of
the
bargain
or
not
usually
the
child
reads
the
mind
better
than
the
teacher
reads
his
this
is
natural
for
all
the
sagacity
the
child
at
liberty
would
use
in
he
now
uses
to
protect
himself
from
a
tyrant
chains
while
the
latter
having
no
immediate
interest
in
knowing
the
child
mind
follows
his
own
advantage
by
leaving
vanity
and
indolence
unrestrained
do
otherwise
with
your
pupil
let
him
always
suppose
himself
master
while
you
really
are
master
no
subjection
is
so
perfect
as
that
which
retains
the
appearance
of
liberty
for
thus
the
will
itself
is
made
captive
is
not
the
helpless
unknowing
child
at
your
mercy
do
you
not
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
control
everything
around
him
have
you
not
power
to
influence
him
as
you
please
are
not
his
work
his
play
his
pleasure
his
pain
in
your
hands
whether
he
knows
it
or
not
doubtless
he
ought
to
do
only
what
he
pleases
but
your
choice
ought
to
control
his
wishes
he
ought
to
take
no
step
that
you
have
not
directed
he
ought
not
to
open
his
lips
without
your
knowing
what
he
is
about
to
say
in
this
case
he
may
without
fear
of
debasing
his
mind
devote
himself
to
exercises
of
the
body
instead
of
sharpening
his
wits
to
escape
an
irksome
subjection
you
will
observe
him
wholly
occupied
in
finding
out
in
everything
around
him
that
part
best
adapted
to
his
present
you
will
be
amazed
at
the
subtilty
of
his
contrivances
for
appropriating
to
himself
all
the
objects
within
the
reach
of
his
understanding
and
for
enjoying
everything
without
regard
to
other
people
opinions
by
thus
leaving
him
free
you
will
not
foster
his
caprices
if
he
never
does
anything
that
does
not
suit
him
he
will
soon
do
only
what
he
ought
to
do
and
although
his
body
be
never
at
rest
still
if
he
is
caring
for
his
present
and
perceptible
interests
all
the
reason
of
which
he
is
capable
will
develop
far
better
and
more
appropriately
than
in
studies
purely
speculative
as
he
does
not
find
you
bent
on
thwarting
him
does
not
distrust
you
has
nothing
to
hide
from
you
he
will
not
deceive
you
or
tell
you
lies
he
will
fearlessly
show
himself
to
you
just
as
he
is
you
may
study
him
entirely
at
your
ease
and
plan
lessons
for
him
which
he
will
all
unconsciously
receive
he
will
not
pry
with
suspicious
curiosity
into
your
affairs
and
feel
pleasure
when
he
finds
you
in
fault
this
is
one
of
our
most
serious
disadvantages
as
i
have
said
one
of
a
child
first
objects
is
to
discover
the
weaknesses
of
those
who
have
control
of
him
this
disposition
may
produce
but
does
not
arise
from
it
but
from
their
desire
to
escape
an
irksome
bondage
oppressed
by
the
yoke
laid
upon
them
children
endeavor
to
shake
it
off
and
the
faults
they
find
in
their
teachers
yield
them
excellent
means
for
doing
this
but
they
acquire
the
habit
of
observing
faults
in
others
and
of
enjoying
such
discoveries
this
source
of
evil
evidently
does
not
exist
in
émile
having
no
interest
to
serve
by
discovering
my
faults
he
will
not
look
for
them
in
me
and
will
have
little
temptation
to
seek
them
in
other
people
this
course
of
conduct
seems
difficult
because
we
do
not
reflect
upon
it
but
taking
it
altogether
it
ought
not
to
be
so
i
am
justified
in
supposing
that
you
know
enough
to
understand
the
business
you
have
undertaken
that
you
know
the
natural
progress
of
the
human
mind
that
you
understand
studying
mankind
in
general
and
in
individual
cases
that
among
all
the
objects
interesting
to
his
age
that
you
mean
to
show
your
pupil
you
know
beforehand
which
of
them
will
influence
his
will
now
if
you
have
the
appliances
and
know
just
how
to
use
them
are
you
not
master
of
the
operation
you
object
that
children
have
caprices
but
in
this
you
are
mistaken
these
caprices
result
from
faulty
discipline
and
are
not
natural
the
children
have
been
accustomed
either
to
obey
or
to
command
and
i
have
said
a
hundred
times
that
neither
of
these
two
things
is
necessary
your
pupil
will
therefore
have
only
such
caprices
as
you
give
him
and
it
is
just
you
should
be
punished
for
your
own
faults
but
do
you
ask
how
these
are
to
be
remedied
it
can
still
be
done
by
means
of
better
management
and
much
patience
physical
training
man
first
natural
movements
are
for
the
purpose
of
comparing
himself
with
whatever
surrounds
him
and
finding
in
each
thing
those
sensible
qualities
likely
to
affect
himself
his
first
study
is
therefore
a
kind
of
experimental
physics
relating
to
his
own
preservation
from
this
before
he
has
fully
understood
his
place
here
on
earth
he
is
turned
aside
to
speculative
studies
while
yet
his
delicate
and
pliable
organs
can
adapt
themselves
to
the
objects
upon
which
they
are
to
act
while
his
senses
still
pure
are
free
from
illusion
it
is
time
to
exercise
both
in
their
peculiar
functions
and
to
learn
the
perceptible
relations
between
ourselves
and
outward
things
since
whatever
enters
the
human
understanding
enters
by
the
senses
primitive
reason
is
a
reason
of
the
senses
serving
as
foundation
for
the
reason
of
the
intellect
our
first
teachers
in
philosophy
are
our
own
feet
hands
and
eyes
to
substitute
books
for
these
is
teaching
us
not
to
reason
but
to
use
the
reason
of
another
to
believe
a
great
deal
and
to
know
nothing
at
all
in
practising
an
art
we
must
begin
by
procuring
apparatus
for
it
and
to
use
this
apparatus
to
advantage
we
must
have
it
solid
enough
to
bear
use
in
learning
to
think
we
must
therefore
employ
our
members
our
senses
our
organs
all
which
are
the
apparatus
of
our
understanding
and
to
use
them
to
the
best
advantage
the
body
which
furnishes
them
must
be
sound
and
robust
our
reason
is
therefore
so
far
from
being
independent
of
the
body
that
a
good
constitution
renders
mental
operations
easy
and
accurate
in
indicating
how
the
long
leisure
of
childhood
ought
to
be
employed
i
am
entering
into
particulars
which
maybe
thought
ridiculous
pretty
lessons
you
will
tell
me
which
you
yourself
criticize
for
teaching
only
what
there
is
no
need
of
learning
why
waste
time
in
instructions
which
always
come
of
their
own
accord
and
cost
neither
care
nor
trouble
what
child
of
twelve
does
not
know
all
you
are
going
to
teach
yours
and
all
that
his
masters
have
taught
him
besides
gentlemen
you
are
mistaken
i
am
teaching
my
pupil
a
very
tedious
and
difficult
art
which
yours
certainly
have
not
acquired
that
of
being
ignorant
for
the
knowledge
of
one
who
gives
himself
credit
for
knowing
only
what
he
really
does
know
reduces
itself
to
a
very
small
compass
you
are
teaching
science
very
good
i
am
dealing
with
the
instrument
by
which
science
is
acquired
all
who
have
reflected
upon
the
mode
of
life
among
the
ancients
attribute
to
gymnastic
exercises
that
vigor
of
body
and
mind
which
so
notably
distinguishes
them
from
us
moderns
montaigne
support
of
this
opinion
shows
that
he
had
fully
adopted
it
he
returns
to
it
again
and
again
in
a
thousand
ways
speaking
of
the
education
of
a
child
he
says
we
must
make
his
mind
robust
by
hardening
his
muscles
inure
him
to
pain
by
accustoming
him
to
labor
break
him
by
severe
exercise
to
the
keen
pangs
of
dislocation
of
colic
of
other
ailments
the
wise
locke
the
excellent
rollin
the
learned
fleury
the
pedantic
de
crouzas
so
different
in
everything
else
agree
exactly
on
this
point
of
abundant
physical
exercise
for
children
it
is
the
wisest
lesson
they
ever
taught
but
the
one
that
is
and
always
will
be
most
neglected
clothing
as
to
clothing
the
limbs
of
a
growing
body
should
be
entirely
free
nothing
should
cramp
their
movements
or
their
growth
nothing
should
fit
too
closely
or
bind
the
body
there
should
be
no
ligatures
whatever
the
present
french
dress
cramps
and
disables
even
a
man
and
is
especially
injurious
to
children
it
arrests
the
circulation
of
the
humors
they
stagnate
from
an
inaction
made
worse
by
a
sedentary
life
this
corruption
of
the
humors
brings
on
the
scurvy
a
disease
becoming
every
day
more
common
among
us
but
unknown
to
the
ancients
protected
from
it
by
their
dress
and
their
mode
of
life
the
hussar
dress
does
not
remedy
this
inconvenience
but
increases
it
since
to
save
the
child
a
few
ligatures
it
compresses
the
entire
body
it
would
be
better
to
keep
children
in
frocks
as
long
as
possible
and
then
put
them
into
loosely
fitting
clothes
without
trying
to
shape
their
figures
and
thereby
spoil
them
their
defects
of
body
and
of
mind
nearly
all
spring
from
the
same
cause
we
are
trying
to
make
men
of
them
before
their
time
of
bright
and
dull
colors
the
former
best
please
a
child
taste
such
colors
are
also
most
becoming
to
them
and
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
in
such
matters
consult
these
natural
coincidences
but
the
moment
a
material
is
preferred
because
it
is
richer
the
child
mind
is
corrupted
by
luxury
and
by
all
sorts
of
whims
preferences
like
this
do
not
spring
up
of
their
own
accord
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
much
choice
of
dress
and
the
motives
of
this
choice
influence
education
not
only
do
thoughtless
mothers
promise
children
fine
clothes
by
way
of
reward
but
foolish
tutors
threaten
them
with
coarser
and
simpler
dress
as
punishment
if
you
do
not
study
your
lessons
if
you
do
not
take
better
care
of
your
clothes
you
shall
be
dressed
like
that
little
rustic
this
is
saying
to
him
rest
assured
that
a
man
is
nothing
but
what
his
clothes
make
him
your
own
worth
depends
on
what
you
wear
is
it
surprising
that
sage
lessons
like
this
so
influence
young
men
that
they
care
for
nothing
but
ornament
and
judge
of
merit
by
outward
appearance
only
generally
children
are
too
warmly
clothed
especially
in
their
earlier
years
they
should
be
inured
to
cold
rather
than
heat
severe
cold
never
incommodes
them
when
they
encounter
it
early
but
the
tissue
of
their
skin
as
yet
yielding
and
tender
allows
too
free
passage
to
perspiration
and
exposure
to
great
heat
invariably
weakens
them
it
has
been
observed
that
more
children
die
in
august
than
in
any
other
month
besides
if
we
compare
northern
and
southern
races
we
find
that
excessive
cold
rather
than
excessive
heat
makes
man
robust
in
proportion
as
the
child
grows
and
his
fibres
are
strengthened
accustom
him
gradually
to
withstand
heat
and
by
degrees
you
will
without
risk
train
him
to
endure
the
glowing
temperature
of
the
torrid
zone
sleep
children
need
a
great
deal
of
sleep
because
they
take
a
great
deal
of
exercise
the
one
acts
as
corrective
to
the
other
so
that
both
are
necessary
as
nature
teaches
us
night
is
the
time
for
rest
constant
observation
shows
that
sleep
is
softer
and
more
profound
while
the
sun
is
below
the
horizon
the
heated
air
does
not
so
perfectly
tranquillize
our
tired
senses
for
this
reason
the
most
salutary
habit
is
to
rise
and
to
go
to
rest
with
the
sun
in
our
climate
man
and
animals
generally
require
more
sleep
in
winter
than
in
summer
but
our
mode
of
life
is
not
so
simple
natural
and
uniform
that
we
can
make
this
regular
habit
a
necessity
we
must
without
doubt
submit
to
regulations
but
it
is
most
important
that
we
should
be
able
to
break
them
without
risk
when
occasion
requires
do
not
then
imprudently
soften
your
pupil
by
letting
him
lie
peacefully
asleep
without
ever
being
disturbed
at
first
let
him
yield
without
restraint
to
the
law
of
nature
but
do
not
forget
that
in
our
day
we
must
be
superior
to
this
law
we
must
be
able
to
go
late
to
rest
and
rise
early
to
be
awakened
suddenly
to
be
up
all
night
without
discomfort
by
beginning
early
and
by
always
proceeding
slowly
we
form
the
constitution
by
the
very
practices
which
would
ruin
it
if
it
were
already
established
it
is
important
that
your
pupil
should
from
the
first
be
accustomed
to
a
hard
bed
so
that
he
may
find
none
uncomfortable
generally
a
life
of
hardship
when
we
are
used
to
it
gives
us
a
far
greater
number
of
agreeable
sensations
than
does
a
life
of
ease
which
creates
an
infinite
number
of
unpleasant
ones
one
too
delicately
reared
can
find
sleep
only
upon
a
bed
of
down
one
accustomed
to
bare
boards
can
find
it
anywhere
no
bed
is
hard
to
him
who
falls
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
touches
the
pillow
the
best
bed
is
the
one
which
brings
the
best
sleep
throughout
the
day
no
slaves
from
persia
but
émile
and
i
will
prepare
our
beds
when
we
are
tilling
the
ground
we
shall
be
making
them
soft
for
our
slumber
exercise
of
the
senses
a
child
has
not
a
man
stature
strength
or
reason
but
he
sees
and
hears
almost
or
quite
as
well
his
sense
of
taste
is
as
keen
though
he
does
not
enjoy
it
as
a
pleasure
our
senses
are
the
first
powers
perfected
in
us
they
are
the
first
that
should
be
cultivated
and
the
only
ones
forgotten
or
at
least
the
most
neglected
to
exercise
the
senses
is
not
merely
to
use
them
but
to
learn
how
to
judge
correctly
by
means
of
them
we
may
say
to
learn
how
to
feel
for
we
can
not
feel
or
hear
or
see
otherwise
than
as
we
have
been
taught
there
is
a
kind
of
exercise
purely
natural
and
mechanical
that
renders
the
body
robust
without
injuring
the
mind
of
this
description
are
swimming
running
leaping
spinning
tops
and
throwing
stones
all
these
are
well
enough
but
have
we
nothing
but
arms
and
legs
have
we
not
eyes
and
ears
as
well
and
are
they
of
no
use
while
the
others
are
employed
use
then
not
only
your
bodily
strength
but
all
the
senses
which
direct
it
make
as
much
of
each
as
possible
and
verify
the
impressions
of
one
by
those
of
another
measure
count
weigh
and
compare
use
no
strength
till
after
you
have
calculated
the
resistance
it
will
meet
be
careful
to
estimate
the
effect
before
you
use
the
means
interest
the
child
in
never
making
any
useless
or
inadequate
trials
of
strength
if
you
accustom
him
to
forecast
the
effect
of
every
movement
and
to
correct
his
errors
by
experience
is
it
not
certain
that
the
more
he
does
the
better
his
judgment
will
be
if
the
lever
he
uses
in
moving
a
heavy
weight
be
too
long
he
will
expend
too
much
motion
if
too
short
he
will
not
have
power
enough
experience
will
teach
him
to
choose
one
exactly
suitable
such
practical
knowledge
then
is
not
beyond
his
years
if
he
wishes
to
carry
a
burden
exactly
as
heavy
as
his
strength
will
bear
without
the
test
of
first
lifting
it
must
he
not
estimate
its
weight
by
the
eye
if
he
understands
comparing
masses
of
the
same
material
but
of
different
size
let
him
choose
between
masses
of
the
same
size
but
of
different
material
this
will
oblige
him
to
compare
them
as
to
specific
gravity
i
have
seen
a
young
man
who
until
he
had
tried
the
experiment
would
not
believe
that
a
pail
full
of
large
chips
weighs
less
than
it
does
when
full
of
water
the
sense
of
touch
we
have
not
equal
control
of
all
our
senses
one
of
them
the
sense
of
touch
is
in
continual
action
so
long
as
we
are
awake
diffused
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
body
it
serves
as
a
perpetual
sentinel
to
warn
us
of
what
is
likely
to
harm
us
by
the
constant
use
of
this
sense
voluntary
or
otherwise
we
gain
our
earliest
experience
it
therefore
stands
less
in
need
of
special
cultivation
we
observe
however
that
the
blind
have
a
more
delicate
and
accurate
touch
than
we
because
not
having
sight
to
guide
them
they
depend
upon
touch
for
the
judgments
we
form
with
the
aid
of
sight
why
then
do
we
not
train
ourselves
to
walk
like
them
in
the
dark
to
recognize
by
the
touch
all
bodies
we
can
reach
to
judge
of
objects
around
us
in
short
to
do
by
night
and
in
the
dark
all
they
do
in
daytime
without
eyesight
so
long
as
the
sun
shines
we
have
the
advantage
of
them
but
they
can
guide
us
in
darkness
we
are
blind
during
half
our
with
this
difference
that
the
really
blind
can
always
guide
themselves
whereas
we
dare
not
take
a
step
in
the
dead
of
night
you
may
remind
me
that
we
have
artificial
light
what
must
we
always
use
machines
who
can
insure
their
being
always
at
hand
when
we
need
them
for
my
part
i
prefer
that
émile
instead
of
keeping
his
eyes
in
a
shop
should
have
them
at
the
ends
of
his
fingers
as
much
as
possible
let
him
be
accustomed
to
play
about
at
night
this
advice
is
more
important
than
it
would
seem
for
men
and
sometimes
for
animals
night
has
naturally
its
terrors
rarely
do
wisdom
or
wit
or
courage
free
us
from
paying
tribute
to
these
terrors
i
have
seen
reasoners
philosophers
soldiers
who
were
utterly
fearless
in
broad
daylight
tremble
like
women
at
the
rustle
of
leaves
by
night
such
terrors
are
supposed
to
be
the
result
of
nursery
tales
the
real
cause
is
the
same
thing
which
makes
the
deaf
distrustful
and
the
lower
classes
superstitious
and
that
is
ignorance
of
objects
and
events
around
us
the
cause
of
the
evil
once
found
suggests
the
remedy
in
everything
habit
benumbs
the
imagination
new
objects
alone
quicken
it
again
objects
keep
active
not
the
imagination
but
the
memory
whence
the
saying
ab
assuetis
non
fit
passio
for
only
the
imagination
can
set
on
fire
our
passions
if
therefore
you
wish
to
cure
any
one
of
the
fear
of
darkness
do
not
reason
with
him
take
him
into
the
dark
often
and
you
may
be
sure
that
will
do
him
more
good
than
philosophical
arguments
when
at
work
on
the
roofs
of
houses
slaters
do
not
feel
their
heads
swim
and
those
accustomed
to
darkness
do
not
fear
it
at
all
there
will
be
one
advantage
of
our
plays
in
the
dark
but
if
you
mean
them
to
be
successful
you
must
make
them
as
gay
as
possible
darkness
is
of
all
things
the
most
gloomy
so
do
not
shut
your
child
up
in
a
dungeon
when
he
goes
into
the
dark
make
him
laugh
when
he
leaves
it
make
him
laugh
again
and
all
the
time
he
is
there
let
the
thought
of
what
he
is
enjoying
and
what
he
will
find
there
when
he
returns
protect
him
from
the
shadowy
terrors
which
might
otherwise
inhabit
it
i
have
heard
some
propose
to
teach
children
not
to
be
afraid
at
night
by
surprising
them
this
is
a
bad
plan
and
its
effect
is
contrary
to
the
one
sought
it
only
makes
them
more
timid
than
before
neither
reason
nor
habit
can
accustom
us
to
a
present
danger
the
nature
and
extent
of
which
we
do
not
know
nor
can
they
lessen
our
dread
of
unexpected
things
however
often
we
meet
with
them
but
how
can
we
guard
our
pupil
against
such
accidents
i
think
the
following
is
the
best
plan
i
will
tell
my
émile
if
any
one
attacks
you
at
night
you
are
justified
in
defending
yourself
for
your
assailant
gives
you
no
notice
whether
he
means
to
hurt
you
or
only
to
frighten
you
as
he
has
taken
you
at
a
disadvantage
seize
him
boldly
no
matter
what
he
may
seem
to
be
hold
him
fast
and
if
he
offers
any
resistance
hit
him
hard
and
often
whatever
he
may
say
or
do
never
let
go
until
you
know
exactly
who
he
is
the
explanation
will
probably
show
you
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
and
if
you
treat
a
practical
joker
in
this
way
he
will
not
be
likely
to
try
the
same
thing
again
although
of
all
our
senses
touch
is
the
one
most
constantly
used
still
as
i
have
said
its
conclusions
are
the
most
rude
and
imperfect
this
is
because
it
is
always
used
at
the
same
time
with
sight
and
because
the
eye
attains
its
object
sooner
than
the
hand
the
mind
nearly
always
decides
without
appealing
to
touch
on
the
other
hand
the
decisions
of
touch
just
because
they
are
so
limited
in
their
range
are
the
most
accurate
for
as
they
extend
no
farther
than
our
arm
length
they
correct
the
errors
of
other
senses
which
deal
with
distant
objects
and
scarcely
grasp
these
objects
at
all
whereas
all
that
the
touch
perceives
it
perceives
thoroughly
besides
if
to
we
add
muscular
action
we
form
a
simultaneous
impression
and
judge
of
weight
and
solidity
as
well
as
of
temperature
size
and
shape
thus
touch
which
of
all
our
senses
best
informs
us
concerning
impressions
made
upon
us
by
external
things
is
the
one
oftenest
used
and
gives
us
most
directly
the
knowledge
necessary
to
our
preservation
the
sense
of
sight
the
sense
of
touch
confines
its
operations
to
a
very
narrow
sphere
around
us
but
those
of
sight
extend
far
beyond
this
sense
is
therefore
liable
to
be
mistaken
with
a
single
glance
a
man
takes
in
half
his
own
horizon
and
in
these
myriad
impressions
and
judgments
resulting
from
them
how
is
it
credible
that
there
should
be
no
mistakes
sight
therefore
is
the
most
defective
of
all
our
senses
precisely
because
it
is
most
and
because
its
operations
by
far
preceding
all
others
are
too
immediate
and
too
vast
to
receive
correction
from
them
besides
the
very
illusions
of
perspective
are
needed
to
make
us
understand
extension
and
to
help
us
in
comparing
its
parts
if
there
were
no
false
appearances
we
could
see
nothing
at
a
distance
if
there
were
no
gradations
in
size
we
could
form
no
estimate
of
distance
or
rather
there
would
be
no
distance
at
all
if
of
two
trees
the
one
a
hundred
paces
away
seemed
as
large
and
distinct
as
the
other
ten
paces
distant
we
should
place
them
side
by
side
if
we
saw
all
objects
in
their
true
dimensions
we
should
see
no
space
whatever
everything
would
appear
to
be
directly
beneath
our
eye
for
judging
of
the
size
and
distance
of
objects
sight
has
only
one
measure
and
that
is
the
angle
they
form
with
our
eye
as
this
is
the
simple
effect
of
a
compound
cause
the
judgment
we
form
from
it
leaves
each
particular
case
undecided
or
is
necessarily
imperfect
for
how
can
i
by
the
sight
alone
tell
whether
the
angle
which
makes
one
object
appear
smaller
than
another
is
caused
by
the
really
lesser
magnitude
of
the
object
or
by
its
greater
distance
from
me
an
opposite
method
must
therefore
be
pursued
instead
of
relying
on
one
sensation
only
we
must
repeat
it
verify
it
by
others
subordinate
sight
to
touch
repressing
the
impetuosity
of
the
first
by
the
steady
even
pace
of
the
second
for
lack
of
this
caution
we
measure
very
inaccurately
by
the
eye
in
determining
height
length
depth
and
distance
that
this
is
not
due
to
organic
defect
but
to
careless
use
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
engineers
surveyors
architects
masons
and
painters
generally
have
a
far
more
accurate
eye
than
we
and
estimate
measures
of
extension
more
correctly
their
business
gives
them
experience
that
we
neglect
to
acquire
and
thus
they
correct
the
ambiguity
of
the
angle
by
means
of
appearances
associated
with
it
which
enable
them
to
determine
more
exactly
the
relation
of
the
two
things
producing
the
angle
children
are
easily
led
into
anything
that
allows
unconstrained
movement
of
the
body
there
are
a
thousand
ways
of
interesting
them
in
measuring
discovering
and
estimating
distances
yonder
is
a
very
tall
how
can
we
manage
to
get
some
cherries
will
the
ladder
in
the
barn
do
there
is
a
very
wide
brook
how
can
we
cross
it
would
one
of
the
planks
in
the
yard
be
long
enough
we
want
to
throw
a
line
from
our
windows
and
catch
some
fish
in
the
moat
around
the
house
how
many
fathoms
long
ought
the
line
to
be
i
want
to
put
up
a
swing
between
those
two
trees
would
four
yards
of
rope
be
enough
for
it
they
say
that
in
the
other
house
our
room
will
be
feet
square
do
you
think
that
will
suit
us
will
it
be
larger
than
this
we
are
very
hungry
which
of
those
two
villages
yonder
can
we
reach
soonest
and
have
our
dinner
as
the
sense
of
sight
is
the
one
least
easily
separated
from
the
judgments
of
the
mind
we
need
a
great
deal
of
time
for
learning
how
to
see
we
must
for
a
long
time
compare
sight
with
touch
if
we
would
accustom
our
eye
to
report
forms
and
distances
accurately
without
touch
and
without
progressive
movement
the
keenest
in
the
world
could
give
us
no
idea
of
extent
to
an
oyster
the
entire
universe
must
be
only
a
single
point
only
by
walking
feeling
counting
and
measuring
do
we
learn
to
estimate
distances
if
we
always
measure
them
however
our
eye
depending
on
this
will
never
gain
accuracy
yet
the
child
ought
not
to
pass
too
soon
from
measuring
to
estimating
it
will
be
better
for
him
after
comparing
by
parts
what
he
can
not
compare
as
wholes
finally
to
substitute
for
measured
aliquot
parts
others
obtained
by
the
eye
alone
he
should
train
himself
in
this
manner
of
measuring
instead
of
always
measuring
with
the
hand
i
prefer
that
the
very
first
operations
of
this
kind
should
be
verified
by
actual
measurements
so
that
he
may
correct
the
mistakes
arising
from
false
appearances
by
a
better
judgment
there
are
natural
measures
nearly
the
same
everywhere
such
as
a
man
pace
the
length
of
his
arm
or
his
height
when
the
child
is
calculating
the
height
of
the
story
of
a
house
his
tutor
may
serve
as
a
unit
of
measure
in
estimating
the
altitude
of
a
steeple
he
may
compare
it
with
that
of
the
neighboring
houses
if
he
wants
to
know
how
many
leagues
there
are
in
a
given
journey
let
him
reckon
the
number
of
hours
spent
in
making
it
on
foot
and
by
all
means
do
none
of
this
work
for
him
let
him
do
it
himself
we
can
not
learn
to
judge
correctly
of
the
extent
and
size
of
bodies
without
also
learning
to
recognize
their
forms
and
even
to
imitate
them
for
such
imitation
is
absolutely
dependent
on
the
laws
of
perspective
and
we
can
not
estimate
extent
from
appearances
without
some
appreciation
of
these
laws
drawing
all
children
being
natural
imitators
try
to
draw
i
would
have
my
pupil
cultivate
this
art
not
exactly
for
the
sake
of
the
art
itself
but
to
render
the
eye
true
and
the
hand
flexible
in
general
it
matters
little
whether
he
understands
this
or
that
exercise
provided
he
acquires
the
mental
insight
and
the
manual
skill
furnished
by
the
exercise
i
should
take
care
therefore
not
to
give
him
a
who
would
give
him
only
copies
to
imitate
and
would
make
him
draw
from
drawings
only
he
shall
have
no
teacher
but
nature
no
models
but
real
things
he
shall
have
before
his
eyes
the
originals
and
not
the
paper
which
represents
them
he
shall
draw
a
house
from
a
real
house
a
tree
from
a
tree
a
human
figure
from
the
man
himself
in
this
way
he
will
accustom
himself
to
observe
bodies
and
their
appearances
and
not
mistake
for
accurate
mutations
those
that
are
false
and
conventional
i
should
even
object
to
his
drawing
anything
from
memory
until
by
frequent
observations
the
exact
forms
of
the
objects
had
clearly
imprinted
themselves
on
his
imagination
lest
substituting
odd
and
fantastic
shapes
for
the
real
things
he
might
lose
the
knowledge
of
proportion
and
a
taste
for
the
beauties
of
nature
i
know
very
well
that
he
will
go
on
daubing
for
a
long
time
without
making
anything
worth
noticing
and
will
be
long
in
mastering
elegance
of
outline
and
in
acquiring
the
deft
stroke
of
a
skilled
draughtsman
he
may
never
learn
to
discern
picturesque
effects
or
draw
with
superior
skill
on
the
other
hand
he
will
have
a
more
correct
eye
a
truer
hand
a
knowledge
of
the
real
relations
of
size
and
shape
in
animals
plants
and
natural
bodies
and
practical
experience
of
the
illusions
of
perspective
this
is
precisely
what
i
intend
not
so
much
that
he
shall
imitate
objects
as
that
he
shall
know
them
i
would
rather
have
him
show
me
an
acanthus
than
a
finished
drawing
of
the
foliation
of
a
capital
yet
i
would
not
allow
my
pupil
to
have
the
enjoyment
of
this
or
any
other
exercise
all
to
himself
by
sharing
it
with
him
i
will
make
him
enjoy
it
still
more
he
shall
have
no
competitor
but
myself
but
i
will
be
that
competitor
continually
and
without
risk
of
jealousy
between
us
it
will
only
interest
him
more
deeply
in
his
studies
like
him
i
will
take
up
the
pencil
and
at
first
i
will
be
as
awkward
as
he
if
i
were
an
apelles
even
i
will
make
myself
a
mere
dauber
i
will
begin
by
sketching
a
man
just
as
a
boy
would
sketch
one
on
a
wall
with
a
dash
for
each
arm
and
with
fingers
larger
than
the
arms
by
and
by
one
or
the
other
of
us
will
discover
this
disproportion
we
shall
observe
that
a
leg
has
thickness
and
that
this
thickness
is
not
the
same
everywhere
that
the
length
of
the
arm
is
determined
by
its
proportion
to
the
body
and
so
on
as
we
go
on
i
will
do
no
more
than
keep
even
step
with
him
or
will
excel
him
by
so
little
that
he
can
always
easily
overtake
and
even
surpass
me
we
will
get
colors
and
brushes
we
will
try
to
imitate
not
only
the
outline
but
the
coloring
and
all
the
other
details
of
objects
we
will
color
we
will
paint
we
will
daub
but
in
all
our
daubing
we
shall
be
continually
peering
into
nature
and
all
we
do
shall
be
done
under
the
eye
of
that
great
teacher
if
we
had
difficulty
in
finding
decorations
for
our
room
we
have
now
all
we
could
desire
i
will
have
our
drawings
framed
so
that
we
can
give
them
no
finishing
touches
and
this
will
make
us
both
careful
to
do
no
negligent
work
i
will
arrange
them
in
order
around
our
room
each
drawing
repeated
twenty
or
thirty
times
and
each
repetition
showing
the
author
progress
from
the
representation
of
a
house
by
an
almost
shapeless
attempt
at
a
square
to
the
accurate
copy
of
its
front
elevation
profile
proportions
and
shading
the
drawings
thus
graded
must
be
interesting
to
ourselves
curious
to
others
and
likely
to
stimulate
further
effort
i
will
inclose
the
first
and
rudest
of
these
in
showy
gilded
frames
to
set
them
off
well
but
as
the
imitation
improves
and
when
the
drawing
is
really
good
i
will
add
only
a
very
simple
black
frame
the
picture
needs
no
ornament
but
itself
and
it
would
be
a
pity
that
the
bordering
should
receive
half
the
attention
both
of
us
will
aspire
to
the
honor
of
a
plain
frame
and
if
either
wishes
to
condemn
the
other
drawing
he
will
say
it
ought
to
have
a
gilt
frame
perhaps
some
day
these
gilded
frames
will
pass
into
a
proverb
with
us
and
we
shall
be
interested
to
observe
how
many
men
do
justice
to
themselves
by
framing
themselves
in
the
very
same
way
geometry
i
have
said
that
geometry
is
not
intelligible
to
children
but
it
is
our
own
fault
we
do
not
observe
that
their
method
is
different
from
ours
and
that
what
is
to
us
the
art
of
reasoning
should
be
to
them
only
the
art
of
seeing
instead
of
giving
them
our
method
we
should
do
better
to
take
theirs
for
in
our
way
of
learning
geometry
imagination
really
does
as
much
as
reason
when
a
proposition
is
stated
we
have
to
imagine
the
demonstration
that
is
we
have
to
find
upon
what
proposition
already
known
the
new
one
depends
and
from
all
the
consequences
of
this
known
principle
select
just
the
one
required
according
to
this
method
the
most
exact
reasoner
if
not
naturally
inventive
must
be
at
fault
and
the
result
is
that
the
teacher
instead
of
making
us
discover
demonstrations
dictates
them
to
us
instead
of
teaching
us
to
reason
he
reasons
for
us
and
exercises
only
our
memory
make
the
diagrams
accurate
combine
them
place
them
one
upon
another
examine
their
relations
and
you
will
discover
the
whole
of
elementary
geometry
by
proceeding
from
one
observation
to
another
without
using
either
definitions
or
problems
or
any
form
of
demonstration
than
simple
superposition
for
my
part
i
do
not
even
pretend
to
teach
émile
geometry
he
shall
teach
it
to
me
i
will
look
for
relations
and
he
shall
discover
them
i
will
look
for
them
in
a
way
that
will
lead
him
to
discover
them
in
drawing
a
circle
for
instance
i
will
not
use
a
compass
but
a
point
at
the
end
of
a
cord
which
turns
on
a
pivot
afterward
when
i
want
to
compare
the
radii
of
a
émile
will
laugh
at
me
and
tell
me
that
the
same
cord
held
with
the
same
tension
can
not
describe
unequal
distances
when
i
want
to
measure
an
angle
of
sixty
degrees
i
will
describe
from
the
apex
of
the
angle
not
an
arc
only
but
an
entire
circle
for
with
children
nothing
must
be
taken
for
granted
i
find
that
the
portion
intercepted
by
the
two
sides
of
the
angle
is
of
the
whole
circumference
afterward
from
the
same
centre
i
describe
another
and
a
larger
circle
and
find
that
this
second
arc
is
of
the
new
circumference
describing
a
third
concentric
circle
i
test
it
in
the
same
way
and
continue
the
process
with
other
concentric
circles
until
émile
vexed
at
my
stupidity
informs
me
that
every
arc
great
or
small
intercepted
by
the
sides
of
this
angle
will
be
of
the
circumference
to
which
it
belongs
you
see
we
are
almost
ready
to
use
the
instruments
intelligently
in
order
to
prove
the
angles
of
a
triangle
equal
to
two
right
angles
a
circle
is
usually
drawn
i
on
the
contrary
will
call
attention
to
this
in
the
circle
and
then
ask
him
now
if
the
circle
were
taken
away
and
the
straight
lines
were
left
would
the
size
of
the
angles
be
changed
it
is
not
customary
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
accuracy
of
figures
in
geometry
the
accuracy
is
taken
for
granted
and
the
demonstration
alone
is
regarded
émile
and
i
will
pay
no
heed
to
the
demonstration
but
aim
to
draw
exactly
straight
and
even
lines
to
make
a
square
perfect
and
a
circle
round
to
test
the
exactness
of
the
figure
we
will
examine
it
in
all
its
visible
properties
and
this
will
give
us
daily
opportunity
of
finding
out
others
we
will
fold
the
two
halves
of
a
circle
on
the
line
of
the
diameter
and
the
halves
of
a
square
on
its
diagonal
and
then
examine
our
two
figures
to
see
which
has
its
bounding
lines
most
nearly
coincident
and
is
therefore
best
constructed
we
will
debate
as
to
whether
this
equality
of
parts
exists
in
all
parallelograms
trapeziums
and
like
figures
sometimes
we
will
endeavor
to
guess
at
the
result
of
the
experiment
before
we
make
it
and
sometimes
to
find
out
the
reasons
why
it
should
result
as
it
does
geometry
for
my
pupil
is
only
the
art
of
using
the
rule
and
compass
well
it
should
not
be
confounded
with
drawing
which
uses
neither
of
these
instruments
the
rule
and
compass
are
to
be
kept
under
lock
and
key
and
he
shall
be
allowed
to
use
them
only
occasionally
and
for
a
short
time
lest
he
fall
into
the
habit
of
daubing
but
sometimes
when
we
go
for
a
walk
we
will
take
our
diagrams
with
us
and
talk
about
what
we
have
done
or
would
like
to
do
hearing
what
has
been
said
as
to
the
two
senses
most
continually
employed
and
most
important
may
illustrate
the
way
in
which
i
should
exercise
the
other
senses
sight
and
touch
deal
alike
with
bodies
at
rest
and
bodies
in
motion
but
as
only
the
vibration
of
the
air
can
arouse
the
sense
of
hearing
noise
or
sound
can
be
made
only
by
a
body
in
motion
if
everything
were
at
rest
we
could
not
hear
at
all
at
night
when
we
move
only
as
we
choose
we
have
nothing
to
fear
except
from
other
bodies
in
motion
we
therefore
need
quick
ears
to
judge
from
our
sensations
whether
the
body
causing
them
is
large
or
small
distant
or
near
and
whether
its
motion
is
violent
or
slight
the
air
when
in
agitation
is
subject
to
reverberations
which
reflect
it
back
produce
echoes
and
repeat
the
sensation
making
the
sonorous
body
heard
elsewhere
than
where
it
really
is
in
a
plain
or
valley
if
you
put
your
ear
to
the
ground
you
can
hear
the
voices
of
men
and
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
much
farther
than
when
standing
upright
as
we
have
compared
sight
with
touch
let
us
also
compare
it
with
hearing
and
consider
which
of
the
two
impressions
leaving
the
same
body
at
the
same
time
soonest
reaches
its
organ
when
we
see
the
flash
of
a
cannon
there
is
still
time
to
avoid
the
shot
but
as
soon
as
we
hear
the
sound
there
is
not
time
the
ball
has
struck
we
can
estimate
the
distance
of
thunder
by
the
interval
between
the
flash
and
the
thunderbolt
make
the
child
understand
such
experiments
try
those
that
are
within
his
own
power
and
discover
others
by
inference
but
it
would
be
better
he
should
know
nothing
about
these
things
than
that
you
should
tell
him
all
he
is
to
know
about
them
we
have
an
organ
that
corresponds
to
that
of
hearing
that
is
the
voice
sight
has
nothing
like
this
for
though
we
can
produce
sounds
we
can
not
give
off
colors
we
have
therefore
fuller
means
of
cultivating
hearing
by
exercising
its
active
and
passive
organs
upon
one
another
the
voice
man
has
three
kinds
of
voice
the
speaking
or
articulate
voice
the
singing
or
melodious
voice
and
the
pathetic
or
accented
voice
which
gives
language
to
passion
and
animates
song
and
speech
a
child
has
these
three
kinds
of
voice
as
well
as
a
man
but
he
does
not
know
how
to
blend
them
in
the
same
way
like
his
elders
he
can
laugh
cry
complain
exclaim
and
groan
but
he
does
not
know
how
to
blend
these
inflections
with
the
two
other
voices
perfect
music
best
accomplishes
this
blending
but
children
are
incapable
of
such
music
and
there
is
never
much
feeling
in
their
singing
in
speaking
their
voice
has
little
energy
and
little
or
no
accent
our
pupil
will
have
even
a
simpler
and
more
uniform
mode
of
speaking
because
his
passions
not
yet
aroused
will
not
mingle
their
language
with
his
do
not
therefore
give
him
dramatic
parts
to
recite
nor
teach
him
to
declaim
he
will
have
too
much
sense
to
emphasize
words
he
can
not
understand
and
to
express
feelings
he
has
never
known
teach
him
to
speak
evenly
clearly
articulately
to
pronounce
correctly
and
without
affectation
to
understand
and
use
the
accent
demanded
by
grammar
and
prosody
train
him
to
avoid
a
common
fault
acquired
in
colleges
of
speaking
louder
than
is
necessary
have
him
speak
loud
enough
to
be
understood
let
there
be
no
exaggeration
in
anything
aim
also
to
render
his
voice
in
singing
even
flexible
and
sonorous
let
his
ear
be
sensitive
to
time
and
harmony
but
to
nothing
more
do
not
expect
of
him
at
his
age
imitative
and
theatrical
music
it
would
be
better
if
he
did
not
even
sing
words
if
he
wished
to
sing
them
i
should
try
to
invent
songs
especially
for
him
such
as
would
interest
him
as
simple
as
his
own
ideas
the
sense
of
taste
of
our
different
sensations
those
of
taste
generally
affect
us
most
we
are
more
interested
in
judging
correctly
of
substances
that
are
to
form
part
of
our
own
bodies
than
of
those
which
merely
surround
us
we
are
indifferent
to
a
thousand
things
as
objects
of
touch
of
hearing
or
of
sight
but
there
is
almost
nothing
to
which
our
sense
of
taste
is
indifferent
besides
the
action
of
this
sense
is
entirely
physical
and
material
imagination
and
imitation
often
give
a
tinge
of
moral
character
to
the
impressions
of
all
the
other
senses
but
to
this
it
appeals
least
of
all
if
at
all
generally
also
persons
of
passionate
and
really
sensitive
temperament
easily
moved
by
the
other
senses
are
rather
indifferent
in
regard
to
this
this
very
fact
which
seems
in
some
measure
to
degrade
the
sense
of
taste
and
to
make
excess
in
its
indulgence
more
contemptible
leads
me
however
to
conclude
that
the
surest
way
to
influence
children
is
by
means
of
their
appetite
gluttony
as
a
motive
is
far
better
than
vanity
for
gluttony
is
a
natural
appetite
depending
directly
on
the
senses
and
vanity
is
the
result
of
opinion
is
subject
to
human
caprice
and
to
abuse
of
all
kinds
gluttony
is
the
passion
of
childhood
and
can
not
hold
its
own
against
any
other
it
disappears
on
the
slightest
occasion
believe
me
the
child
will
only
too
soon
leave
off
thinking
of
his
appetite
for
when
his
heart
is
occupied
his
palate
will
give
him
little
concern
when
he
is
a
man
a
thousand
impulsive
feelings
will
divert
his
mind
from
gluttony
to
vanity
for
this
last
passion
alone
takes
advantage
of
all
others
and
ends
by
absorbing
them
all
i
have
sometimes
watched
closely
those
who
are
especially
fond
of
dainties
who
as
soon
as
they
awoke
were
thinking
of
what
they
should
eat
during
the
day
and
could
describe
a
dinner
with
more
minuteness
than
polybius
uses
in
describing
a
battle
and
i
have
always
found
that
these
supposed
men
were
nothing
but
children
forty
years
old
without
any
force
or
steadiness
of
character
gluttony
is
the
vice
of
men
who
have
no
stamina
the
soul
of
a
gourmand
has
its
seat
in
his
palate
alone
formed
only
for
eating
stupid
incapable
he
is
in
his
true
place
only
at
the
table
his
judgment
is
worthless
except
in
the
matter
of
dishes
as
he
values
these
far
more
highly
than
others
in
which
we
are
interested
as
well
as
he
let
us
without
regret
leave
this
business
of
the
palate
to
him
it
is
weak
precaution
to
fear
that
gluttony
may
take
root
in
a
child
capable
of
anything
else
as
children
we
think
only
of
eating
but
in
youth
we
think
of
it
no
more
everything
tastes
good
to
us
and
we
have
many
other
things
to
occupy
us
yet
i
would
not
use
so
low
a
motive
injudiciously
or
reward
a
good
action
with
a
since
childhood
is
or
should
be
altogether
made
up
of
play
and
frolic
i
see
no
reason
why
exercise
purely
physical
should
not
have
a
material
and
tangible
reward
if
a
young
majorcan
seeing
a
basket
in
the
top
of
a
tree
brings
it
down
with
a
stone
from
his
sling
why
should
he
not
have
the
recompense
of
a
good
breakfast
to
repair
the
strength
used
in
earning
it
a
young
spartan
braving
the
risk
of
a
hundred
lashes
stole
into
a
kitchen
and
carried
off
a
live
which
concealed
under
his
coat
scratched
and
bit
him
till
the
blood
came
to
avoid
the
disgrace
of
detection
the
child
allowed
the
creature
to
gnaw
his
entrails
and
did
not
lift
an
eyelash
or
utter
a
cry
was
it
not
just
that
as
a
reward
he
was
allowed
to
devour
the
beast
that
had
done
its
best
to
devour
him
a
good
meal
ought
never
to
be
given
as
a
reward
but
why
should
it
not
sometimes
be
the
result
of
the
pains
taken
to
secure
it
émile
will
not
consider
the
cake
i
put
upon
a
stone
as
a
reward
for
running
well
he
only
knows
that
he
can
not
have
the
cake
unless
he
reaches
it
before
some
other
person
does
this
does
not
contradict
the
principle
before
laid
down
as
to
simplicity
in
diet
for
to
please
a
child
appetite
we
need
not
arouse
it
but
merely
satisfy
it
and
this
may
be
done
with
the
most
ordinary
things
in
the
world
if
we
do
not
take
pains
to
refine
his
taste
his
continual
appetite
arising
from
his
rapid
growth
is
an
unfailing
sauce
which
supplies
the
place
of
many
others
with
a
little
fruit
or
some
of
the
dainties
made
from
milk
or
a
bit
of
pastry
rather
more
of
a
rarity
than
the
bread
and
more
than
all
with
some
tact
in
bestowing
you
may
lead
an
army
of
children
to
the
world
end
without
giving
them
any
taste
for
highly
spiced
food
or
running
any
risk
of
cloying
their
palate
besides
whatever
kind
of
diet
you
give
children
provided
they
are
used
only
to
simple
and
common
articles
of
food
let
them
eat
run
and
play
as
much
as
they
please
and
you
may
rest
assured
they
will
never
eat
too
much
or
be
troubled
with
indigestion
but
if
you
starve
them
half
the
time
and
they
can
find
a
way
to
escape
your
vigilance
they
will
injure
themselves
with
all
their
might
and
eat
until
they
are
entirely
surfeited
unless
we
dictate
to
our
appetite
other
rules
than
those
of
nature
it
will
never
be
inordinate
always
regulating
prescribing
adding
retrenching
we
do
everything
with
scales
in
hand
but
the
scales
measure
our
own
whims
and
not
our
digestive
organs
to
return
to
my
illustrations
among
country
folk
the
larder
and
the
orchard
are
always
open
and
nobody
young
or
old
knows
what
indigestion
means
result
the
pupil
at
the
age
of
ten
or
twelve
supposing
that
my
method
is
indeed
that
of
nature
itself
and
that
i
have
made
no
mistakes
in
applying
it
i
have
now
conducted
my
pupil
through
the
region
of
sensations
to
the
boundaries
of
childish
reason
the
first
step
beyond
should
be
that
of
a
man
but
before
beginning
this
new
career
let
us
for
a
moment
cast
our
eyes
over
what
we
have
just
traversed
every
age
and
station
in
life
has
a
perfection
a
maturity
all
its
own
we
often
hear
of
a
man
in
contemplating
a
child
we
shall
find
more
novelty
and
perhaps
no
less
pleasure
the
existence
of
finite
beings
is
so
barren
and
so
limited
that
when
we
see
only
what
is
it
never
stirs
us
to
emotion
real
objects
are
adorned
by
the
creations
of
fancy
and
without
this
charm
yield
us
but
a
barren
satisfaction
tending
no
farther
than
to
the
organ
that
perceives
them
and
the
heart
is
left
cold
the
earth
clad
in
the
glories
of
autumn
displays
a
wealth
which
the
wondering
eye
enjoys
but
which
arouses
no
feeling
within
us
it
springs
less
from
sentiment
than
from
reflection
in
spring
the
landscape
is
still
almost
bare
the
forests
yield
no
shade
the
verdure
is
only
beginning
to
bud
and
yet
the
heart
is
deeply
moved
at
the
sight
we
feel
within
us
a
new
life
when
we
see
nature
thus
revive
delightful
images
surround
us
the
companions
of
pleasure
gentle
tears
ever
ready
to
spring
at
the
touch
of
tender
feelings
brim
our
eyes
but
upon
the
panorama
of
the
vintage
season
animated
and
pleasant
though
it
be
we
have
no
tears
to
bestow
why
is
there
this
difference
it
is
because
imagination
joins
to
the
sight
of
that
of
following
seasons
to
the
tender
buds
the
eye
adds
the
flowers
the
fruit
the
shade
sometimes
also
the
mysteries
that
may
lie
hid
in
them
into
a
single
point
of
time
our
fancy
gathers
all
the
year
seasons
yet
to
be
and
sees
things
less
as
they
really
will
be
than
as
it
would
choose
to
have
them
in
autumn
on
the
contrary
there
is
nothing
but
bare
reality
if
we
think
of
spring
then
the
thought
of
winter
checks
us
and
beneath
snow
and
the
chilled
imagination
dies
the
charm
we
feel
in
looking
upon
a
lovely
childhood
rather
than
upon
the
perfection
of
mature
age
arises
from
the
same
source
if
the
sight
of
a
man
in
his
prime
gives
us
like
pleasure
it
is
when
the
memory
of
what
he
has
done
leads
us
to
review
his
past
life
and
bring
up
his
younger
days
if
we
think
of
him
as
he
is
or
as
he
will
be
in
old
age
the
idea
of
declining
nature
destroys
all
our
pleasure
there
can
be
none
in
seeing
a
man
rapidly
drawing
near
the
grave
the
image
of
death
is
a
blight
upon
everything
but
when
i
imagine
a
child
of
ten
or
twelve
sound
vigorous
well
developed
for
his
age
it
gives
me
pleasure
whether
on
account
of
the
present
or
of
the
future
i
see
him
impetuous
sprightly
animated
free
from
anxiety
or
corroding
care
living
wholly
in
his
own
present
and
enjoying
a
life
full
to
overflowing
i
foresee
what
he
will
be
in
later
years
using
the
senses
the
intellect
the
bodily
vigor
every
day
unfolding
within
him
when
i
think
of
him
as
a
child
he
delights
me
when
i
think
of
him
as
a
man
he
delights
me
still
more
his
glowing
pulses
seem
to
warm
my
own
i
feel
his
life
within
myself
and
his
sprightliness
renews
my
youth
his
form
his
bearing
his
countenance
manifest
and
happiness
health
glows
in
his
face
his
firm
step
is
a
sign
of
bodily
vigor
his
complexion
still
delicate
but
not
insipid
has
in
it
no
effeminate
softness
for
air
and
sun
have
already
given
him
the
honorable
stamp
of
his
sex
his
still
rounded
muscles
are
beginning
to
show
signs
of
growing
expressiveness
his
eyes
not
yet
lighted
with
the
fire
of
feeling
have
all
their
natural
serenity
years
of
sorrow
have
never
made
them
dim
nor
have
his
cheeks
been
furrowed
by
unceasing
tears
his
quick
but
decided
movements
show
the
sprightliness
of
his
age
and
his
sturdy
independence
they
bear
testimony
to
the
abundant
physical
exercise
he
has
enjoyed
his
bearing
is
frank
and
open
but
not
insolent
or
vain
his
face
never
glued
to
his
books
is
never
downcast
you
need
not
tell
him
to
raise
his
head
for
neither
fear
nor
shame
has
ever
made
it
droop
make
room
for
him
among
you
and
examine
him
gentlemen
question
him
with
all
confidence
without
fear
of
his
troubling
you
with
idle
chatter
or
impertinent
queries
do
not
be
afraid
of
his
taking
up
all
your
time
or
making
it
impossible
for
you
to
get
rid
of
him
you
need
not
expect
brilliant
speeches
that
i
have
taught
him
but
only
the
frank
and
simple
truth
without
preparation
ornament
or
vanity
when
he
tells
you
what
he
has
been
thinking
or
doing
he
will
speak
of
the
evil
as
freely
as
of
the
good
not
in
the
least
embarrassed
by
its
effect
upon
those
who
hear
him
he
will
use
words
in
all
the
simplicity
of
their
original
meaning
we
like
to
prophesy
good
of
children
and
are
always
sorry
when
a
stream
of
nonsense
comes
to
disappoint
hopes
aroused
by
some
chance
repartee
my
pupil
seldom
awakens
such
hopes
and
will
never
cause
such
regrets
for
he
never
utters
an
unnecessary
word
or
wastes
breath
in
babble
to
which
he
knows
nobody
will
listen
if
his
ideas
have
a
limited
range
they
are
nevertheless
clear
if
he
knows
nothing
by
heart
he
knows
a
great
deal
from
experience
if
he
does
not
read
ordinary
books
so
well
as
other
children
he
reads
the
book
of
nature
far
better
his
mind
is
in
his
brain
and
not
at
his
tongue
end
he
has
less
memory
than
judgment
he
can
speak
only
one
language
but
he
understands
what
he
says
and
if
he
does
not
say
it
as
well
as
another
he
can
do
things
far
better
than
they
can
he
does
not
know
the
meaning
of
custom
or
routine
what
he
did
yesterday
does
not
in
any
wise
affect
his
actions
of
he
never
follows
a
rigid
formula
or
gives
way
in
the
least
to
authority
or
to
example
everything
he
does
and
says
is
after
the
natural
fashion
of
his
age
expect
of
him
therefore
no
formal
speeches
or
studied
manners
but
always
the
faithful
expression
of
his
own
ideas
and
a
conduct
arising
from
his
own
inclinations
you
will
find
he
has
a
few
moral
ideas
in
relation
to
his
own
concerns
but
in
regard
to
men
in
general
none
at
all
of
what
use
would
these
last
be
to
him
since
a
child
is
not
yet
an
active
member
of
society
speak
to
him
of
liberty
of
property
even
of
things
done
by
common
consent
and
he
may
understand
you
he
knows
why
his
own
things
belong
to
him
and
those
of
another
person
do
not
and
beyond
this
he
knows
nothing
speak
to
him
of
duty
and
obedience
and
he
will
not
know
what
you
mean
command
him
to
do
a
thing
and
he
will
not
understand
you
but
tell
him
that
if
he
will
do
you
such
and
such
a
favor
you
will
do
the
same
for
him
whenever
you
can
and
he
will
readily
oblige
you
for
he
likes
nothing
better
than
to
increase
his
power
and
to
lay
you
under
obligations
he
knows
to
be
inviolable
perhaps
too
he
enjoys
being
recognized
as
somebody
and
accounted
worth
something
but
if
this
last
be
his
motive
he
has
already
left
the
path
of
nature
and
you
have
not
effectually
closed
the
approaches
to
vanity
if
he
needs
help
he
will
ask
it
of
the
very
first
person
he
meets
be
he
monarch
or
to
him
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
by
his
manner
of
asking
you
can
see
that
he
feels
you
do
not
owe
him
anything
he
knows
that
what
he
asks
is
really
a
favor
to
him
which
humanity
will
induce
you
to
grant
his
expressions
are
simple
and
laconic
his
voice
his
look
his
gesture
are
those
of
one
equally
accustomed
to
consent
or
to
refusal
they
show
neither
the
cringing
submission
of
a
slave
nor
the
imperious
tone
of
a
master
but
modest
confidence
in
his
and
the
noble
and
touching
gentleness
of
one
who
is
free
but
sensitive
and
feeble
asking
aid
of
another
also
free
but
powerful
and
kind
if
you
do
what
he
asks
he
does
not
thank
you
but
feels
that
he
has
laid
himself
under
obligation
if
you
refuse
he
will
not
complain
or
insist
he
knows
it
would
be
of
no
use
he
will
not
say
i
was
refused
but
it
was
impossible
and
as
has
been
already
said
we
do
not
often
rebel
against
an
acknowledged
necessity
leave
him
at
liberty
and
by
himself
and
without
saying
a
word
watch
what
he
does
and
how
he
does
it
knowing
perfectly
well
that
he
is
free
he
will
do
nothing
from
mere
thoughtlessness
or
just
to
show
that
he
can
do
it
for
is
he
not
aware
that
he
is
always
his
own
master
he
is
alert
nimble
and
active
his
movements
have
all
the
agility
of
his
years
but
you
will
not
see
one
that
has
not
some
definite
aim
no
matter
what
he
may
wish
to
do
he
will
never
undertake
what
he
can
not
do
for
he
has
tested
his
own
strength
and
knows
exactly
what
it
is
the
means
he
uses
are
always
adapted
to
the
end
sought
and
he
rarely
does
anything
without
being
assured
he
will
succeed
in
it
his
eye
will
be
attentive
and
critical
and
he
will
not
ask
foolish
questions
about
everything
he
sees
before
making
any
inquiries
he
will
tire
himself
trying
to
find
a
thing
out
for
himself
if
he
meets
with
unexpected
difficulties
he
will
be
less
disturbed
by
them
than
another
child
and
less
frightened
if
there
is
danger
as
nothing
has
been
done
to
arouse
his
still
dormant
imagination
he
sees
things
only
as
they
are
estimates
danger
accurately
and
is
always
he
has
so
often
had
to
give
way
to
necessity
that
he
no
longer
rebels
against
it
having
borne
its
yoke
ever
since
he
was
born
he
is
accustomed
to
it
and
is
ready
for
whatever
may
come
work
and
play
are
alike
to
him
his
plays
are
his
occupations
and
he
sees
no
difference
between
the
two
he
throws
himself
into
everything
with
charming
earnestness
and
freedom
which
shows
the
bent
of
his
mind
and
the
range
of
his
knowledge
who
does
not
enjoy
seeing
a
pretty
child
of
this
age
with
his
bright
expression
of
serene
content
and
laughing
open
countenance
playing
at
the
most
serious
things
or
deeply
occupied
with
the
most
frivolous
amusements
he
has
reached
the
maturity
of
childhood
has
lived
a
child
life
not
gaining
perfection
at
the
cost
of
his
happiness
but
developing
the
one
by
means
of
the
other
while
acquiring
all
the
reasoning
power
possible
to
his
age
he
has
been
as
happy
and
as
free
as
his
nature
allowed
if
the
fatal
scythe
is
to
cut
down
in
him
the
flower
of
our
hopes
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
lament
at
the
same
time
his
life
and
his
death
our
grief
will
not
be
embittered
by
the
recollection
of
the
sorrows
we
have
made
him
feel
we
shall
be
able
to
say
at
least
he
enjoyed
his
childhood
we
robbed
him
of
nothing
that
nature
gave
him
in
regard
to
this
early
education
the
chief
difficulty
is
that
only
men
can
understand
it
and
that
a
child
so
carefully
educated
seems
to
an
ordinary
observer
only
a
young
scapegrace
a
tutor
usually
considers
his
own
interests
rather
than
those
of
his
pupil
he
devotes
himself
to
proving
that
he
loses
no
time
and
earns
his
salary
he
teaches
the
child
such
accomplishments
as
can
be
readily
exhibited
when
required
without
regard
to
their
usefulness
or
worthlessness
so
long
as
they
are
showy
without
selecting
or
discerning
he
charges
the
child
memory
with
a
vast
amount
of
rubbish
when
the
child
is
to
be
examined
the
tutor
makes
him
display
his
wares
and
after
thus
giving
satisfaction
folds
up
his
pack
again
and
goes
his
way
my
pupil
is
not
so
rich
he
has
no
pack
at
all
to
display
he
has
nothing
but
himself
now
a
child
like
a
man
can
not
be
seen
all
at
once
what
observer
can
at
the
first
glance
seize
upon
the
peculiar
traits
such
observers
there
are
but
they
are
uncommon
and
among
a
hundred
thousand
fathers
you
will
not
find
one
such
child
one
who
does
not
speak
reading
these
lines
we
are
reminded
of
the
admirable
works
of
dickens
the
celebrated
english
novelist
who
so
touchingly
depicts
the
sufferings
of
children
made
unhappy
by
the
inhumanity
of
teachers
or
neglected
as
to
their
need
of
free
air
of
liberty
of
affection

like

who
had
built

immense
bridge
of

at

insubordination
of

elements
ordered
chains
to
be
cast
into

and
had
the
rebellious
waves
beaten
with
rods
the
feeling
of
a
republican
of
the
citizen
of
geneva
justly
shocked
by
monarchial
superstitions
louis
xiv
and
louis
xv
had
had
in
fact
from
the
days
of
their
first
playthings
the
degrading
spectacle
of
a
universal
servility
prostrated
before
their
cradle
the
sentiment
here
uttered
was
still
uncommon
and
almost
unknown
when
rousseau
wrote
it
he
did
much
toward
creating
it
and
making
it
popular
civil
bondage
as
understood
by
rousseau
consists
in
the
laws
and
obligations
of
civilized
life
itself
he
extols
the
state
of
nature
as
the
ideal
condition
the
condition
of
perfect
freedom
without
seeing
that
on
the
contrary
true
liberty
can
not
exist
without
the
protection
of
laws
while
the
state
of
nature
is
only
the
enslavement
of
the
weak
by
the
strong
the
triumph
of
brute
force
in
this
unconditional
form
the
principle
is
inadmissible
any
one
who
has
the
rearing
of
children
knows
this
but
the
idea
underlying
the
paradox
ought
to
be
recognized
for
it
is
a
just
one
we
ought
not
to
command
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
commanding
but
solely
to
interpret
to
the
child
the
requirements
of
the
case
in
hand
to
command
him
for
the
sake
of
commanding
is
an
abuse
of
power
it
is
a
baseness
which
will
end
in
disaster
on
the
other
hand
we
can
not
leave
it
to
circumstances
to
forbid
what
ought
not
to
be
done
only
the
command
should
be
intelligible
reasonable
and
unyielding
this
is
really
what
rousseau
means
this
is
not
strictly
true
the
child
early
has
the
consciousness
of
right
and
wrong
and
if
it
be
true
that
neither
chastisement
nor
reproof
is
to
be
abused
it
is
no
less
certain
that
conscience
is
early
awake
within
him
and
that
it
ought
not
to
be
neglected
in
a
work
so
delicate
as
that
of
education
on
condition
be
it
understood
that
we
act
with
simplicity
without
pedantry
and
that
we
employ
example
more
than
lectures
rousseau
says
this
admirably
a
few
pages
farther
on
nothing
is
more
injudicious
than
such
a
question
especially
when
the
child
is
in
fault
in
that
case
if
he
thinks
you
know
what
he
has
done
he
will
see
that
you
are
laying
a
snare
for
him
and
this
opinion
can
not
fail
to
set
him
against
you
if
he
thinks
you
do
not
know
he
will
say
to
himself
why
should
i
disclose
my
fault
and
thus
the
first
temptation
to
falsehood
is
the
result
of
your
imprudent
note
by
j
rousseau
he
refers
to
cato
surnamed
of
utica
from
the
african
city
in
which
he
ended
his
own
life
when
a
child
he
was
often
invited
by
his
brother
to
the
house
of
the
sulla
the
cruelties
of
the
tyrant
roused
the
boy
to
indignation
and
it
was
necessary
to
watch
him
lest
he
should
attempt
to
kill
sulla
it
was
in
the
antechamber
that
the
scene
described
by
plutarch
occurred
while
writing
this
i
have
reflected
a
hundred
times
that
in
an
extended
work
it
is
impossible
always
to
use
the
same
words
in
the
same
sense
no
language
is
rich
enough
to
furnish
terms
and
expressions
to
keep
pace
with
the
possible
modifications
of
our
ideas
the
method
which
defines
all
the
terms
and
substitutes
the
definition
for
the
term
is
fine
but
impracticable
for
how
shall
we
then
avoid
travelling
in
a
circle
if
definitions
could
be
given
without
using
words
they
might
be
useful
nevertheless
i
am
convinced
that
poor
as
our
language
is
we
can
make
ourselves
understood
not
by
always
attaching
the
same
meaning
to
the
same
words
but
by
so
using
each
word
that
its
meaning
shall
be
sufficiently
determined
by
the
ideas
nearly
related
to
it
and
so
that
each
sentence
in
which
a
word
is
used
shall
serve
to
define
the
word
sometimes
i
say
that
children
are
incapable
of
reasoning
and
sometimes
i
make
them
reason
extremely
well
i
think
that
my
ideas
do
not
contradict
each
other
though
i
can
not
escape
the
inconvenient
contradictions
of
my
mode
of
expression
another
exaggeration
the
idea
is
not
to
teach
children
to
speak
another
language
as
perfectly
as
their
own
there
are
three
different
objects
to
be
attained
in
studying
languages
first
this
study
is
meant
to
render
easy
by
comparison
and
practice
the
knowledge
and
free
use
of
the
mother
tongue
second
it
is
useful
as
intellectual
gymnastics
developing
attention
reflection
reasoning
and
taste
this
result
is
to
be
expected
particularly
from
the
study
of
the
ancient
languages
third
it
lowers
the
barriers
separating
nations
and
furnishes
valuable
means
of
intercourse
which
science

and
commerce
can
not
afford
to
do
without
the
french
have
not
always
shown
wisdom
in
ignoring
the
language
of
their
neighbors
or
their
rivals
from
this
passage
it
is
plain
that
the
objections
lately
raised
by
intelligent
persons
against
the
abuse
of
latin
conversations
and
verses
are
not
of
recent
date
after
all
there
is
indeed
a
faulty
method
of
teaching
history
by
giving
children
a
dry
list
of
facts
names
and
dates
on
the
other
hand
to
offer
them
theories
upon
the
philosophy
of
history
is
quite
as
unprofitable
yet
it
is
not
an
absurd
error
but
a
duty
to
teach
them
the
broad
outlines
of
history
to
tell
them
of
deeds
of
renown
of
mighty
works
accomplished
of
men
celebrated
for
the
good
or
the
evil
they
have
done
to
interest
them
in
the
past
of
humanity
be
it
melancholy
or
glorious
by
abuse
of
logic
rousseau
in
protesting
against
one
excess
falls
into
another
rousseau
here
analyzes
several
of
la
fontaine
fables
to
show
the
immorality
and
the
danger
of
their
ethics
he
dwells
particularly
upon
the
fable
of
the
fox
and
the
crow
in
this
he
is
right
the
morality
of
the
greater
part
of
these
fables
leaves
much
to
be
desired
but
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
teacher
from
making
the
application
the
memory
of
a
child
is
pliable
and
vigorous
not
to
cultivate
it
would
be
doing
him
great
injustice
we
need
not
say
that
a
true
teacher
not
only
chooses
but
by
his
instructions
explains
and
rectifies
everything
he
requires
his
pupil
to
read
or
to
learn
by
heart
with
this
reservation
one
can
not
but
admire
this
aversion
of
rousseau
for
and
exclusive
cultivation
of
the
memory
in
a
few
pages
may
here
be
found
a
complete
philosophy
of
teaching
adapted
to
the
regeneration
of
a
people
rousseau
here
alludes
to
the
typographical
lottery
invented
by
louis
dumas
a
french
author
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
an
imitation
of
a
and
was
intended
to
teach
in
an
agreeable
way
not
only
reading
but
even
grammar
and
spelling
there
may
be
good
features
in
all
these
systems
but
we
certainly
can
not
save
the
child
all
trouble
we
ought
to
let
him
understand
that
work
must
be
in
earnest
besides
as
moralists
and
teachers
we
ought
not
to
neglect
giving
children
some
kinds
of
work
demanding
application
they
will
be
in
better
spirits
for
recreation
hours
after
study
it
is
well
to
combine
the
two
methods
to
keep
the
child
occupied
with
what
immediately
concerns
him
and
to
interest
him
also
in
what
is
more
remote
whether
in
space
or
in
time
he
ought
not
to
become
too
positive
nor
yet
should
he
be
chimerical
the
order
of
nature
itself
has
provided
for
this
by
making
the
child
inquisitive
about
things
around
him
and
at
the
same
time
about
things
far
away
this
expresses
rather
too
vehemently
a
true
idea
do
not
try
to
impart
a
rigid
education
whose
apparent
correctness
hides
grave
defects
allow
free
course
to
the
child
instinctive
activity
and
turbulence
let
nature
speak
do
not
crave
reserve
and
fastidiousness
at
the
expense
of
frankness
and
vigor
of
mind
this
is
what
the
writer
really
means
an
english
philosopher
who
died
in
he
wrote
a
very
celebrated
treatise
on
the
education
of
children
a
celebrated
professor
rector
of
the
university
of
paris
who
died
in
he
left
a
number
of
works
on
education
an
abbé
of
the
seventeenth
century
who
wrote
a
much
valued
history
of
the
church
and
a
treatise
on
the
method
and
choice
of

he
was

as

book
third
the
third
book
has
to
do
with
the
youth
as
he
is
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
fifteen
at
this
time
his
strength
is
proportionately
greatest
and
this
is
the
most
important
period
in
his
life
it
is
the
time
for
labor
and
study
not
indeed
for
studies
of
all
kinds
but
for
those
whose
necessity
the
student
himself
feels
the
principle
that
ought
to
guide
him
now
is
that
of
utility
all
the
master
talent
consists
in
leading
him
to
discover
what
is
really
useful
to
him
language
and
history
offer
him
little
that
is
interesting
he
applies
himself
to
studying
natural
phenomena
because
they
arouse
his
curiosity
and
afford
him
means
of
overcoming
his
difficulties
he
makes
his
own
instruments
and
invents
what
apparatus
he
needs
he
does
not
depend
upon
another
to
direct
him
but
follows
where
his
own
good
sense
points
the
way
robinson
crusoe
on
his
island
is
his
ideal
and
this
book
furnishes
the
reading
best
suited
to
his
age
he
should
have
some
manual
occupation
as
much
on
account
of
the
uncertain
future
as
for
the
sake
of
satisfying
his
own
constant
activity
side
by
side
with
the
body
the
mind
is
developed
by
a
taste
for
reflection
and
is
finally
prepared
for
studies
of
a
higher
order
with
this
period
childhood
ends
and
youth
begins
the
age
of
study
although
up
to
the
beginning
of
youth
life
is
on
the
whole
a
period
of
weakness
there
is
a
time
during
this
earlier
age
when
our
strength
increases
beyond
what
our
wants
require
and
the
growing
animal
still
absolutely
weak
becomes
relatively
strong
his
wants
being
as
yet
partly
undeveloped
his
present
strength
is
more
than
sufficient
to
provide
for
those
of
the
present
as
a
man
he
would
be
very
weak
as
child
he
is
very
strong
whence
arises
this
weakness
of
ours
but
from
the
inequality
between
our
desires
and
the
strength
we
have
for
fulfilling
them
our
passions
weaken
us
because
the
gratification
of
them
requires
more
than
our
natural
strength
if
we
have
fewer
desires
we
are
so
much
the
stronger
whoever
can
do
more
than
his
wishes
demand
has
strength
to
spare
he
is
strong
indeed
of
this
the
third
stage
of
childhood
i
have
now
to
speak
i
still
call
it
childhood
for
want
of
a
better
term
to
express
the
idea
for
this
age
not
yet
that
of
puberty
approaches
youth
at
the
age
of
twelve
or
thirteen
the
child
physical
strength
develops
much
faster
than
his
wants
he
braves
without
inconvenience
the
inclemency
of
climate
and
seasons
scarcely
feeling
it
at
all
natural
heat
serves
him
instead
of
clothing
appetite
instead
of
sauce
when
he
is
drowsy
he
lies
down
on
the
ground
and
falls
asleep
thus
he
finds
around
him
everything
he
needs
not
governed
by
caprices
his
desires
extend
no
farther
than
his
own
arms
can
reach
not
only
is
he
sufficient
for
himself
but
at
this
one
time
in
all
his
life
he
has
more
strength
than
he
really
requires
what
then
shall
he
do
with
this
superabundance
of
mental
and
physical
strength
which
he
will
hereafter
need
but
endeavor
to
employ
it
in
ways
which
will
at
some
time
be
of
use
to
him
and
thus
throw
this
surplus
vitality
forward
into
the
future
the
robust
child
shall
make
provision
for
his
weaker
manhood
but
he
will
not
garner
it
in
barns
or
lay
it
up
in
coffers
that
can
be
plundered
to
be
real
owner
of
this
treasure
he
must
store
it
up
in
his
arms
in
his
brain
in
himself
the
present
then
is
the
time
to
labor
to
receive
instruction
and
to
study
nature
so
ordains
not
i
human
intelligence
has
its
limits
we
can
neither
know
everything
nor
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
little
that
other
men
know
since
the
reverse
of
every
false
proposition
is
a
truth
the
number
of
truths
like
the
number
of
errors
is
inexhaustible
we
have
to
select
what
is
to
be
taught
as
well
as
the
time
for
learning
it
of
the
kinds
of
knowledge
within
our
power
some
are
false
some
useless
some
serve
only
to
foster
pride
only
the
few
that
really
conduce
to
our
are
worthy
of
study
by
a
wise
man
or
by
a
youth
intended
to
be
a
wise
man
the
question
is
not
what
may
be
known
but
what
will
be
of
the
most
use
when
it
is
known
from
these
few
we
must
again
deduct
such
as
require
a
ripeness
of
understanding
and
a
knowledge
of
human
relations
which
a
child
can
not
possibly
acquire
such
as
though
true
in
themselves
incline
an
inexperienced
mind
to
judge
wrongly
of
other
things
this
reduces
us
to
a
circle
small
indeed
in
relation
to
existing
things
but
immense
when
we
consider
the
capacity
of
the
child
mind
how
daring
was
the
hand
that
first
ventured
to
lift
the
veil
of
darkness
from
our
human
understanding
what
abysses
due
to
our
unwise
learning
yawn
around
the
unfortunate
youth
tremble
you
who
are
to
conduct
him
by
these
perilous
ways
and
to
lift
for
him
the
sacred
veil
of
nature
be
sure
of
your
own
brain
and
of
his
lest
either
or
perhaps
both
grow
dizzy
at
the
sight
beware
of
the
glamour
of
falsehood
and
of
the
intoxicating
fumes
of
pride
always
bear
in
mind
that
ignorance
has
never
been
harmful
that
error
alone
is
fatal
and
that
our
errors
arise
not
from
what
we
do
not
know
but
from
what
we
think
we
do
know
the
incentive
of
curiosity
the
same
instinct
animates
all
the
different
faculties
of
man
to
the
activity
of
the
body
striving
to
develop
itself
succeeds
the
activity
of
the
mind
endeavoring
to
instruct
itself
children
are
at
first
only
restless
afterwards
they
are
inquisitive
their
curiosity
rightly
trained
is
the
incentive
of
the
age
we
are
now
considering
we
must
always
distinguish
natural
inclinations
from
those
that
have
their
source
in
opinion
there
is
a
thirst
for
knowledge
which
is
founded
only
upon
a
desire
to
be
thought
learned
and
another
springing
from
our
natural
curiosity
concerning
anything
which
nearly
or
remotely
interests
us
our
desire
for
happiness
is
inborn
and
as
it
can
never
be
fully
satisfied
we
are
always
seeking
ways
to
increase
what
we
have
this
first
principle
of
curiosity
is
natural
to
the
heart
of
man
but
is
developed
only
in
proportion
to
our
passions
and
to
our
advance
in
knowledge
call
your
pupil
attention
to
the
phenomena
of
nature
and
you
will
soon
render
him
inquisitive
but
if
you
would
keep
this
curiosity
alive
do
not
be
in
haste
to
satisfy
it
ask
him
questions
that
he
can
comprehend
and
let
him
solve
them
let
him
know
a
thing
because
he
has
found
it
out
for
himself
and
not
because
you
have
told
him
of
it
let
him
not
learn
science
but
discover
it
for
himself
if
once
you
substitute
authority
for
reason
he
will
not
reason
any
more
he
will
only
be
the
sport
of
other
people
opinions
when
you
are
ready
to
teach
this
child
geography
you
get
together
your
globes
and
your
maps
and
what
machines
they
are
why
instead
of
using
all
these
representations
do
you
not
begin
by
showing
him
the
object
itself
so
as
to
let
him
know
what
you
are
talking
of
on
some
beautiful
evening
take
the
child
to
walk
with
you
in
a
place
suitable
for
your
purpose
where
in
the
unobstructed
horizon
the
setting
sun
can
be
plainly
seen
take
a
careful
observation
of
all
the
objects
marking
the
spot
at
which
it
goes
down
when
you
go
for
an
airing
next
day
return
to
this
same
place
before
the
sun
rises
you
can
see
it
announce
itself
by
arrows
of
fire
the
brightness
increases
the
east
seems
all
aflame
from
its
glow
you
anticipate
long
beforehand
the
coming
of
day
every
moment
you
imagine
you
see
it
at
last
it
really
does
appear
a
brilliant
point
which
rises
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
instantly
fills
all
space
the
veil
of
shadows
is
cast
down
and
disappears
we
know
our
once
more
and
find
it
more
beautiful
than
ever
the
verdure
has
taken
on
fresh
vigor
during
the
night
it
is
revealed
with
its
brilliant
of
reflecting
light
and
color
to
the
eye
in
the
first
golden
rays
of
the
day
the
full
choir
of
birds
none
silent
salute
in
concert
the
father
of
life
their
warbling
still
faint
with
the
languor
of
a
peaceful
awakening
is
now
more
lingering
and
sweet
than
at
other
hours
of
the
day
all
this
fills
the
senses
with
a
charm
and
freshness
which
seems
to
touch
our
inmost
soul
no
one
can
resist
this
enchanting
hour
or
behold
with
indifference
a
spectacle
so
grand
so
beautiful
so
full
of
all
delight
carried
away
by
such
a
sight
the
teacher
is
eager
to
impart
to
the
child
his
own
enthusiasm
and
thinks
to
arouse
it
by
calling
attention
to
what
he
himself
feels
what
folly
the
drama
of
nature
lives
only
in
the
heart
to
see
it
one
must
feel
it
the
child
sees
the
objects
but
not
the
relations
that
bind
them
together
he
can
make
nothing
of
their
harmony
the
complex
and
momentary
impression
of
all
these
sensations
requires
an
experience
he
has
never
gained
and
feelings
he
has
never
known
if
he
has
never
crossed
the
desert
and
felt
its
burning
sands
scorch
his
feet
the
stifling
reflection
of
the
sun
from
its
rocks
oppress
him
how
can
he
fully
enjoy
the
coolness
of
a
beautiful
morning
how
can
the
perfume
of
flowers
the
cooling
vapor
of
the
dew
the
sinking
of
his
footstep
in
the
soft
and
pleasant
turf
enchant
his
senses
how
can
the
singing
of
birds
delight
him
while
the
accents
of
love
and
pleasure
are
yet
unknown
how
can
he
see
with
transport
the
rise
of
so
beautiful
a
day
unless
imagination
can
paint
all
the
transports
with
which
it
may
be
filled
and
lastly
how
can
he
be
moved
by
the
beautiful
panorama
of
nature
if
he
does
not
know
by
whose
tender
care
it
has
been
adorned
do
not
talk
to
the
child
about
things
he
can
not
understand
let
him
hear
from
you
no
descriptions
no
eloquence
no
figurative
language
no
poetry
sentiment
and
taste
are
just
now
out
of
the
question
continue
to
be
clear
unaffected
and
dispassionate
the
time
for
using
another
language
will
come
only
too
soon
educated
in
the
spirit
of
our
principles
accustomed
to
look
for
resources
within
himself
and
to
have
recourse
to
others
only
when
he
finds
himself
really
helpless
he
will
examine
every
new
object
for
a
long
time
without
saying
a
word
he
is
thoughtful
and
not
disposed
to
ask
questions
be
satisfied
therefore
with
presenting
objects
at
appropriate
times
and
in
appropriate
ways
when
you
see
his
curiosity
fairly
at
work
ask
him
some
laconic
question
which
will
suggest
its
own
answer
on
this
occasion
having
watched
the
sunrise
from
beginning
to
end
with
him
having
made
him
notice
the
mountains
and
other
neighboring
objects
on
the
same
side
and
allowed
him
to
talk
about
them
just
as
he
pleases
be
silent
for
a
few
minutes
as
if
in
deep
thought
and
then
say
to
him
i
think
the
sun
set
over
there
and
now
it
has
risen
over
here
how
can
that
be
so
say
no
more
if
he
asks
questions
do
not
answer
them
speak
of
something
else
leave
him
to
himself
and
he
will
be
certain
to
think
the
matter
over
to
give
the
child
the
habit
of
attention
and
to
impress
him
deeply
with
any
truth
affecting
the
senses
let
him
pass
several
restless
days
before
he
discovers
that
truth
if
the
one
in
question
does
not
thus
impress
him
you
may
make
him
see
it
more
clearly
by
reversing
the
problem
if
he
does
not
know
how
the
sun
passes
from
its
setting
to
its
rising
he
at
least
does
know
how
it
travels
from
its
rising
to
its
setting
his
eyes
alone
teach
him
this
explain
your
first
question
by
the
second
if
your
pupil
be
not
absolutely
stupid
the
analogy
is
so
plain
that
he
can
not
escape
it
this
is
his
first
lesson
in
cosmography
as
we
pass
slowly
from
one
sensible
idea
to
another
familiarize
ourselves
for
a
long
time
with
each
before
considering
the
next
and
do
not
force
our
pupil
attention
it
will
be
a
long
way
from
this
point
to
a
knowledge
of
the
sun
course
and
of
the
shape
of
the
earth
but
as
all
the
apparent
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
are
upon
the
same
principle
and
the
first
observation
prepares
the
way
for
all
the
rest
less
effort
if
more
time
is
required
to
pass
from
the
daily
rotation
of
the
earth
to
the
calculation
of
eclipses
than
to
understand
clearly
the
phenomena
of
day
and
night
since
the
sun
apparently
revolves
about
the
earth
it
describes
a
circle
and
we
already
know
that
every
circle
must
have
a
centre
this
centre
being
in
the
heart
of
the
earth
can
not
be
seen
but
we
may
mark
upon
the
surface
two
opposite
points
that
correspond
to
it
a
rod
passing
through
these
three
points
and
extending
from
one
side
of
the
heavens
to
the
other
shall
be
the
axis
of
the
earth
and
of
the
apparent
daily
motion
a
spherical
top
turning
on
its
point
shall
represent
the
heavens
revolving
on
their
axis
the
two
extremities
of
the
top
are
the
two
poles
the
child
will
be
interested
in
knowing
one
of
them
which
i
will
show
him
near
the
tail
of
ursa
minor
this
will
serve
to
amuse
us
for
one
night
by
degrees
we
shall
grow
familiar
with
the
stars
and
this
will
awaken
a
desire
to
know
the
planets
and
to
watch
the
constellations
we
have
seen
the
sun
rise
at
midsummer
we
will
also
watch
its
rising
at
christmas
or
some
other
fine
day
in
winter
for
be
it
known
that
we
are
not
at
all
idle
and
that
we
make
a
joke
of
braving
the
cold
i
take
care
to
make
this
second
observation
in
the
same
place
as
the
first
and
after
some
conversation
to
pave
the
way
for
it
one
or
the
other
of
us
will
be
sure
to
exclaim
how
queer
that
is
the
sun
does
not
rise
where
it
used
to
rise
here
are
our
old
landmarks
and
now
it
is
rising
over
yonder
then
there
must
be
one
east
for
summer
and
another
for
winter
now
young
teacher
your
way
is
plain
these
examples
ought
to
suffice
you
for
teaching
the
sphere
very
understandingly
by
taking
the
world
for
your
globe
and
the
real
sun
instead
of
your
artificial
sun
things
rather
than
their
signs
in
general
never
show
the
representation
of
a
thing
unless
it
be
impossible
to
show
the
thing
itself
for
the
sign
absorbs
the
attention
and
makes
him
lose
sight
of
the
thing
signified
the
armillary
sphere
seems
to
me
poorly
designed
and
in
bad
proportion
its
confused
circles
and
odd
figures
giving
it
the
look
of
a
conjurer
apparatus
are
enough
to
frighten
a
child
the
earth
is
too
small
the
circles
are
too
many
and
too
large
some
of
them
the
colures
for
instance
are
entirely
useless
every
circle
is
larger
than
the
earth
the
pasteboard
gives
them
an
appearance
of
solidity
which
creates
the
mistaken
impression
that
they
are
circular
masses
which
really
exist
when
you
tell
the
child
that
these
are
imaginary
circles
he
understands
neither
what
he
sees
nor
what
you
mean
shall
we
never
learn
to
put
ourselves
in
the
child
place
we
do
not
enter
into
his
thoughts
but
suppose
them
exactly
like
our
own
constantly
following
our
own
method
of
reasoning
we
cram
his
mind
not
only
with
a
concatenation
of
truths
but
also
with
extravagant
notions
and
errors
in
the
study
of
the
sciences
it
is
an
open
question
whether
we
ought
to
use
synthesis
or
analysis
it
is
not
always
necessary
to
choose
either
in
the
same
process
of
investigation
we
can
sometimes
both
resolve
and
compound
and
while
the
child
thinks
he
is
only
analyzing
we
can
direct
him
by
the
methods
teachers
usually
employ
by
thus
using
both
we
make
each
prove
the
other
starting
at
the
same
moment
from
two
opposite
points
and
never
imagining
that
one
road
connects
them
he
will
be
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
what
he
supposed
to
be
two
paths
finally
meet
as
one
i
would
for
example
take
geography
at
these
two
extremes
and
add
to
the
study
of
the
earth
motions
the
measurement
of
its
parts
beginning
with
our
own
while
the
child
studying
the
sphere
is
transported
into
the
heavens
bring
him
back
to
the
measurement
of
the
earth
and
first
show
him
his
own
home
the
two
in
his
geography
shall
be
the
town
in
which
he
lives
and
his
father
house
in
the
country
afterward
shall
come
the
places
lying
between
these
two
then
the
neighboring
rivers
lastly
the
aspect
of
the
sun
and
the
manner
of
finding
out
where
the
east
is
this
last
is
the
point
of
union
let
him
make
himself
a
map
of
all
these
details
a
very
simple
map
including
at
first
only
two
objects
then
by
degrees
the
others
as
he
learns
their
distance
and
position
you
see
now
what
an
advantage
we
have
gained
beforehand
by
making
his
eyes
serve
him
instead
of
a
compass
even
with
this
it
may
be
necessary
to
direct
him
a
little
but
very
little
and
without
appearing
to
do
so
at
all
when
he
makes
mistakes
let
him
make
them
do
not
correct
them
wait
in
silence
until
he
can
see
and
correct
them
himself
or
at
most
take
a
good
opportunity
to
set
in
motion
some
thing
which
will
direct
his
attention
to
them
if
he
were
never
to
make
mistakes
he
could
not
learn
half
so
well
besides
the
important
thing
is
not
that
he
should
know
the
exact
topography
of
the
country
but
that
he
should
learn
how
to
find
it
out
by
himself
it
matters
little
whether
he
has
maps
in
his
mind
or
not
so
that
he
understands
what
they
represent
and
has
a
clear
idea
of
how
they
are
made
mark
the
difference
between
the
learning
of
your
pupils
and
the
ignorance
of
mine
they
know
all
about
maps
and
he
can
make
them
our
maps
will
serve
as
new
decorations
for
our
room
imparting
a
taste
for
science
bear
in
mind
always
that
the
life
and
soul
of
my
system
is
not
to
teach
the
child
many
things
but
to
allow
only
correct
and
clear
ideas
to
enter
his
mind
i
do
not
care
if
he
knows
nothing
so
long
as
he
is
not
mistaken
to
guard
him
from
errors
he
might
learn
i
furnish
his
mind
with
truths
only
reason
and
judgment
enter
slowly
prejudices
crowd
in
and
he
must
be
preserved
from
these
last
yet
if
you
consider
science
in
itself
you
launch
upon
an
unfathomable
and
boundless
sea
full
of
unavoidable
dangers
when
i
see
a
man
carried
away
by
his
love
for
knowledge
hastening
from
one
alluring
science
to
another
without
knowing
where
to
stop
i
think
i
see
a
child
gathering
shells
upon
the
seashore
at
first
he
loads
himself
with
them
then
tempted
by
others
he
throws
these
away
and
gathers
more
at
last
weighed
down
by
so
many
and
no
longer
knowing
which
to
choose
he
ends
by
throwing
all
away
and
returning
in
our
early
years
time
passed
slowly
we
endeavored
to
lose
it
for
fear
of
misusing
it
the
case
is
reversed
now
we
have
not
time
enough
for
doing
all
that
we
find
useful
bear
in
mind
that
the
passions
are
drawing
nearer
and
that
as
soon
as
they
knock
at
the
door
your
pupil
will
have
eyes
and
ears
for
them
alone
the
tranquil
period
of
intelligence
is
so
brief
and
has
so
many
other
necessary
uses
that
only
folly
imagines
it
long
enough
to
make
the
child
a
learned
man
the
thing
is
not
to
teach
him
knowledge
but
to
give
him
a
love
for
it
and
a
good
method
of
acquiring
it
when
this
love
has
grown
stronger
certainly
this
is
a
fundamental
principle
in
all
good
education
now
also
is
the
time
to
accustom
him
gradually
to
concentrate
attention
on
a
single
object
this
attention
however
should
never
result
from
constraint
but
from
desire
and
pleasure
be
careful
that
it
shall
not
grow
irksome
or
approach
the
point
of
weariness
leave
any
subject
just
before
he
grows
tired
of
it
for
the
learning
it
matters
less
to
him
than
the
never
being
obliged
to
learn
anything
against
his
will
if
he
himself
questions
you
answer
so
as
to
keep
alive
his
curiosity
not
to
satisfy
it
altogether
above
all
when
you
find
that
he
makes
inquiries
not
for
the
sake
of
learning
something
but
to
talk
at
random
and
annoy
you
with
silly
questions
pause
at
once
assured
that
he
cares
nothing
about
the
matter
but
only
to
occupy
your
time
with
himself
less
regard
should
be
paid
to
what
he
says
than
to
the
motive
which
leads
him
to
speak
this
caution
heretofore
unnecessary
is
of
the
utmost
importance
as
soon
as
a
child
begins
to
reason
there
is
a
chain
of
general
truths
by
which
all
sciences
are
linked
to
common
principles
and
successively
unfolded
this
chain
is
the
method
of
philosophers
with
which
for
the
present
we
have
nothing
to
do
there
is
another
altogether
different
which
shows
each
object
as
the
cause
of
another
and
always
points
out
the
one
following
this
order
which
by
a
perpetual
curiosity
keeps
alive
the
attention
demanded
by
all
is
the
one
followed
by
most
men
and
of
all
others
necessary
with
children
when
in
making
our
maps
we
found
out
the
place
of
the
east
we
were
obliged
to
draw
meridians
the
two
points
of
intersection
between
the
equal
shadows
of
night
and
morning
furnish
an
excellent
meridian
for
an
astronomer
thirteen
years
old
but
these
meridians
disappear
it
takes
time
to
draw
them
they
oblige
us
to
work
always
in
the
same
place
so
much
care
so
much
annoyance
will
tire
him
out
at
last
we
have
seen
and
provided
for
this
beforehand
i
have
again
begun
upon
tedious
and
minute
details
readers
i
hear
your
murmurs
and
disregard
them
i
will
not
sacrifice
to
your
impatience
the
most
useful
part
of
this
book
do
what
you
please
with
my
tediousness
as
i
have
done
as
i
pleased
in
regard
to
your
complaints
the
juggler
for
some
time
my
pupil
and
i
had
observed
that
different
bodies
such
as
amber
glass
and
wax
when
rubbed
attract
straws
and
that
others
do
not
attract
them
by
accident
we
discovered
one
that
has
a
virtue
more
extraordinary
still
that
of
attracting
at
a
distance
and
without
being
rubbed
iron
filings
and
other
bits
of
iron
this
peculiarity
amused
us
for
some
time
before
we
saw
any
use
in
it
at
last
we
found
out
that
it
may
be
communicated
to
iron
itself
when
magnetized
to
a
certain
degree
one
day
we
went
to
a
fair
where
a
juggler
with
a
piece
of
bread
attracted
a
duck
made
of
wax
and
floating
on
a
bowl
of
water
much
surprised
we
did
not
however
say
he
is
a
conjurer
for
we
knew
nothing
about
conjurers
continually
struck
by
effects
whose
causes
we
do
not
know
we
were
not
in
haste
to
decide
the
matter
and
remained
in
ignorance
until
we
found
a
way
out
of
it
when
we
reached
home
we
had
talked
so
much
of
the
duck
at
the
fair
that
we
thought
we
would
endeavor
to
copy
it
taking
a
perfect
needle
well
magnetized
we
inclosed
it
in
white
wax
modelled
as
well
as
we
could
do
it
into
the
shape
of
a
duck
so
that
the
needle
passed
entirely
through
the
body
and
with
its
larger
end
formed
the
duck
bill
we
placed
the
duck
upon
the
water
applied
to
the
beak
the
handle
of
a
key
and
saw
with
a
delight
easy
to
imagine
that
our
duck
would
follow
the
key
precisely
as
the
one
at
the
fair
had
followed
the
piece
of
bread
we
saw
that
some
time
or
other
we
might
observe
the
direction
in
which
the
duck
turned
when
left
to
itself
upon
the
water
but
absorbed
at
that
time
by
another
object
we
wanted
nothing
more
that
evening
having
in
our
pockets
bread
prepared
for
the
occasion
we
returned
to
the
fair
as
soon
as
the
mountebank
had
performed
his
feat
my
little
philosopher
scarcely
able
to
contain
himself
told
him
that
the
thing
was
not
hard
to
do
and
that
he
could
do
it
himself
he
was
taken
at
his
word
instantly
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
bread
in
which
he
had
hidden
the
bit
of
iron
approaching
the
table
his
heart
beat
fast
almost
tremblingly
he
presented
the
bread
the
duck
came
toward
it
and
followed
it
the
child
shouted
and
danced
for
joy
at
the
clapping
of
hands
and
the
acclamations
of
all
present
his
head
swam
and
he
was
almost
beside
himself
the
juggler
was
astonished
but
embraced
and
congratulated
him
begging
that
we
would
honor
him
again
by
our
presence
on
the
following
day
adding
that
he
would
take
care
to
have
a
larger
company
present
to
applaud
our
skill
my
little
naturalist
filled
with
pride
began
to
prattle
but
i
silenced
him
and
led
him
away
loaded
with
praises
the
child
counted
the
minutes
until
the
morrow
with
impatience
that
made
me
smile
he
invited
everybody
he
met
gladly
would
he
have
had
all
mankind
as
witnesses
of
his
triumph
he
could
scarcely
wait
for
the
hour
agreed
upon
and
long
before
it
came
flew
to
the
place
appointed
the
hall
was
already
full
and
on
entering
his
little
heart
beat
fast
other
feats
were
to
come
first
the
juggler
outdid
himself
and
there
were
some
really
wonderful
performances
the
child
paid
no
attention
to
these
his
excitement
had
thrown
him
into
a
perspiration
he
was
almost
breathless
and
fingered
the
bread
in
his
pocket
with
a
hand
trembling
with
impatience
at
last
his
turn
came
and
the
master
pompously
announced
the
fact
rather
bashfully
the
boy
drew
near
and
held
forth
his
bread
alas
for
the
changes
in
human
affairs
the
duck
yesterday
so
tame
had
grown
wild
instead
of
presenting
its
bill
it
turned
about
and
swam
away
avoiding
the
bread
and
the
hand
which
presented
it
as
carefully
as
it
had
before
followed
them
after
many
fruitless
attempts
each
received
with
derision
the
child
complained
that
a
trick
was
played
on
him
and
defied
the
juggler
to
attract
the
duck
the
man
without
a
word
took
a
piece
of
bread
and
presented
it
to
the
duck
which
instantly
followed
it
and
came
towards
his
hand
the
child
took
the
same
bit
of
bread
but
far
from
having
better
success
he
saw
the
duck
make
sport
of
him
by
whirling
round
and
round
as
it
swam
about
the
edge
of
the
basin
at
last
he
retired
in
great
confusion
no
longer
daring
to
encounter
the
hisses
which
followed
then
the
juggler
took
the
bit
of
bread
the
child
had
brought
and
succeeded
as
well
with
it
as
with
his
own
in
the
presence
of
the
entire
company
he
drew
out
the
needle
making
another
joke
at
our
expense
then
with
the
bread
thus
disarmed
he
attracted
the
duck
as
before
he
did
the
same
thing
with
a
piece
of
bread
which
a
third
person
cut
off
in
the
presence
of
all
again
with
his
glove
and
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
at
last
going
to
the
middle
of
the
room
he
declared
in
the
emphatic
tone
peculiar
to
his
sort
that
the
duck
would
obey
his
voice
quite
as
well
as
his
gesture
he
spoke
and
the
duck
obeyed
him
commanded
it
to
go
to
the
right
and
it
went
to
the
right
to
return
and
it
did
so
to
turn
and
it
turned
itself
about
each
movement
was
as
prompt
as
the
command
the
redoubled
applause
was
a
repeated
affront
to
us
we
stole
away
unmolested
and
shut
ourselves
up
in
our
room
without
proclaiming
our
success
far
and
wide
as
we
had
meant
to
do
there
was
a
knock
at
our
door
next
morning
i
opened
it
and
there
stood
the
mountebank
who
modestly
complained
of
our
conduct
what
had
he
done
to
us
that
we
should
try
to
throw
discredit
on
his
performances
and
take
away
his
livelihood
what
is
so
wonderful
in
the
art
of
attracting
a
wax
duck
that
the
honor
should
be
worth
the
price
of
an
honest
man
living
faith
gentlemen
if
i
had
any
other
way
of
earning
my
bread
i
should
boast
very
little
of
this
way
you
may
well
believe
that
a
man
who
has
spent
his
life
in
practising
this
pitiful
trade
understands
it
much
better
than
you
who
devote
only
a
few
minutes
to
it
if
i
did
not
show
you
my
best
performances
the
first
time
it
was
because
a
man
ought
not
to
be
such
a
fool
as
to
parade
everything
he
knows
i
always
take
care
to
keep
my
best
things
for
a
fit
occasion
and
i
have
others
too
to
rebuke
young
and
thoughtless
people
besides
gentlemen
i
am
going
to
teach
you
in
the
goodness
of
my
heart
the
secret
which
puzzled
you
so
much
begging
that
you
will
not
abuse
your
knowledge
of
it
to
injure
me
and
that
another
time
you
will
use
more
discretion
then
he
showed
us
his
apparatus
and
we
saw
to
our
surprise
that
it
consisted
only
of
a
powerful
magnet
moved
by
a
child
concealed
beneath
the
table
the
man
put
up
his
machine
again
and
after
thanking
him
and
making
due
apologies
we
offered
him
a
present
he
refused
saying
no
gentlemen
i
am
not
so
well
pleased
with
you
as
to
accept
presents
from
you
you
can
not
help
being
under
an
obligation
to
me
and
that
is
revenge
enough
but
you
see
generosity
is
to
be
found
in
every
station
in
life
i
take
pay
for
my
performances
not
for
my
lessons
as
he
was
going
out
he
reprimanded
me
pointedly
and
aloud
i
willingly
pardon
this
child
said
he
he
has
offended
only
through
ignorance
but
you
sir
must
have
known
the
nature
of
his
fault
why
did
you
allow
him
to
commit
such
a
fault
since
you
live
together
you
who
are
older
ought
to
have
taken
the
trouble
of
advising
him
the
authority
of
your
experience
should
have
guided
him
when
he
is
old
enough
to
reproach
you
for
his
childish
errors
he
will
certainly
blame
you
for
those
of
which
you
did
not
warn
him
he
went
away
leaving
us
greatly
abashed
i
took
upon
myself
the
blame
of
my
easy
compliance
and
promised
the
child
that
another
time
i
would
sacrifice
it
to
his
interest
and
warn
him
of
his
faults
before
they
were
committed
for
a
time
was
coming
when
our
relations
would
be
changed
and
the
severity
of
the
tutor
must
succeed
to
the
complaisance
of
an
equal
this
change
should
be
gradual
everything
must
be
foreseen
and
that
long
beforehand
the
following
day
we
returned
to
the
fair
to
see
once
more
the
trick
whose
secret
we
had
learned
we
approached
our
juggling
socrates
with
deep
respect
hardly
venturing
to
look
at
him
he
overwhelmed
us
with
civilities
and
seated
us
with
a
marked
attention
which
added
to
our
humiliation
he
performed
his
tricks
as
usual
but
took
pains
to
amuse
himself
for
a
long
time
with
the
duck
trick
often
looking
at
us
with
a
rather
defiant
air
we
understood
it
perfectly
and
did
not
breathe
a
syllable
if
my
pupil
had
even
dared
to
open
his
mouth
he
would
have
deserved
to
be
annihilated
all
the
details
of
this
illustration
are
far
more
important
than
they
appear
how
many
lessons
are
here
combined
in
one
how
many
mortifying
effects
does
the
first
feeling
of
vanity
bring
upon
us
young
teachers
watch
carefully
its
first
manifestation
if
you
can
thus
turn
it
into
humiliation
and
disgrace
be
assured
that
a
second
lesson
will
not
soon
be
necessary
what
an
amount
of
preparation
you
will
say
true
and
all
to
make
us
a
compass
to
use
instead
of
a
meridian
line
having
learned
that
a
magnet
acts
through
other
bodies
we
were
all
impatience
until
we
had
made
an
apparatus
like
the
one
we
had
seen
a
hollow
with
a
very
shallow
basin
adjusted
upon
it
and
filled
with
water
a
duck
rather
more
carefully
made
and
so
on
watching
this
apparatus
attentively
and
often
we
finally
observed
that
the
duck
when
at
rest
nearly
always
turned
in
the
same
direction
following
up
the
experiment
by
examining
this
direction
we
found
it
to
be
from
south
to
north
nothing
more
was
necessary
our
compass
was
invented
or
might
as
well
have
been
we
had
begun
to
study
physics
experimental
physics
the
earth
has
different
climates
and
these
have
different
temperatures
as
we
approach
the
poles
the
variation
of
seasons
is
more
perceptible
all
bodies
contract
with
cold
and
expand
with
heat
this
effect
is
more
readily
measured
in
liquids
and
is
particularly
noticeable
in
spirituous
liquors
this
fact
suggested
the
idea
of
the
thermometer
the
wind
strikes
our
faces
air
is
therefore
a
body
a
fluid
we
feel
it
though
we
can
not
see
it
turn
a
glass
vessel
upside
down
in
water
and
the
water
will
not
fill
it
unless
you
leave
a
vent
for
the
air
therefore
air
is
capable
of
resistance
sink
the
glass
lower
and
the
water
rises
in
the
region
of
the
glass
although
it
does
not
entirely
fill
that
space
air
is
therefore
to
some
extent
compressible
a
ball
filled
with
compressed
air
bounds
much
better
than
when
filled
with
anything
else
air
is
therefore
elastic
when
lying
at
full
length
in
the
bath
raise
the
arm
horizontally
out
of
the
water
and
you
feel
it
burdened
by
a
great
weight
air
is
therefore
heavy
put
air
in
equilibrium
with
other
bodies
and
you
can
measure
its
weight
from
these
observations
were
constructed
the
barometer
the
siphon
the
and
the
all
the
laws
of
statics
and
hydrostatics
were
discovered
by
experiments
as
simple
as
these
i
would
not
have
my
pupil
study
them
in
a
laboratory
of
experimental
physics
i
dislike
all
that
array
of
machines
and
instruments
the
parade
of
science
is
fatal
to
science
itself
all
those
machines
frighten
the
child
or
else
their
singular
forms
divide
and
distract
the
attention
he
ought
to
give
to
their
effects
i
would
make
all
our
own
machines
and
not
begin
by
making
the
instrument
before
the
experiment
has
been
tried
but
after
apparently
lighting
by
chance
on
the
experiment
i
should
by
degrees
invent
instruments
for
verifying
it
these
instruments
should
not
be
so
perfect
and
exact
as
our
ideas
of
what
they
should
be
and
of
the
operations
resulting
from
them
for
the
first
lesson
in
statics
instead
of
using
balances
i
put
a
stick
across
the
back
of
a
chair
and
when
evenly
balanced
measure
its
two
portions
i
add
weights
to
each
part
sometimes
equal
sometimes
unequal
pushing
it
to
or
fro
as
may
be
necessary
i
finally
discover
that
equilibrium
results
from
a
reciprocal
proportion
between
the
amount
of
weight
and
the
length
of
the
levers
thus
my
little
student
of
physics
can
rectify
balances
without
having
ever
seen
them
when
we
thus
learn
by
ourselves
instead
of
learning
from
others
our
ideas
are
far
more
definite
and
clear
besides
if
our
reason
is
not
accustomed
to
slavish
submission
to
authority
this
discovering
relations
linking
one
idea
to
another
and
inventing
apparatus
renders
us
much
more
ingenious
if
instead
we
take
everything
just
as
it
is
given
to
us
we
allow
our
minds
to
sink
down
into
indifference
just
as
a
man
who
always
lets
his
servants
dress
him
and
wait
on
him
and
his
horses
carry
him
about
loses
finally
not
only
the
vigor
but
even
the
use
of
his
limbs
boileau
boasted
that
he
had
taught
racine
to
rhyme
with
difficulty
there
are
many
excellent
methods
for
studying
science
but
we
are
in
sore
need
of
one
to
teach
us
how
to
learn
them
with
more
effort
of
our
own
the
most
manifest
value
of
these
slow
and
laborious
researches
is
that
amid
speculative
studies
they
maintain
the
activity
and
suppleness
of
the
body
by
training
the
hands
to
labor
and
creating
habits
useful
to
any
man
so
many
instruments
are
invented
to
aid
in
our
experiments
and
to
supplement
the
action
of
our
senses
that
we
neglect
to
use
the
senses
themselves
if
the
graphometer
measures
the
size
of
an
angle
for
us
we
need
not
estimate
it
ourselves
the
eye
which
measured
distances
with
precision
intrusts
this
work
to
the
chain
the
steelyard
saves
me
the
trouble
of
measuring
weights
by
the
hand
the
more
ingenious
our
apparatus
the
more
clumsy
and
awkward
do
our
organs
become
if
we
surround
ourselves
with
instruments
we
shall
no
longer
find
them
within
ourselves
but
when
in
making
the
apparatus
we
employ
the
skill
and
sagacity
required
in
doing
without
them
we
do
not
lose
but
gain
by
adding
art
to
nature
we
become
more
ingenious
and
no
less
skilful
if
instead
of
keeping
a
child
at
his
books
i
keep
him
busy
in
a
workshop
his
hands
labor
to
his
mind
advantage
while
he
regards
himself
only
as
a
workman
he
is
growing
into
a
philosopher
this
kind
of
exercise
has
other
uses
of
which
i
will
speak
hereafter
and
we
shall
see
how
philosophic
amusements
prepare
us
for
the
true
functions
of
manhood
i
have
already
remarked
that
purely
speculative
studies
are
rarely
adapted
to
children
even
when
approaching
the
period
of
youth
but
without
making
them
enter
very
deeply
into
systematic
physics
let
all
the
experiments
be
connected
by
some
kind
of
dependence
by
which
the
child
can
arrange
them
in
his
mind
and
recall
them
at
need
for
we
can
not
without
something
of
this
sort
retain
isolated
facts
or
even
reasonings
long
in
memory
in
investigating
the
laws
of
nature
always
begin
with
the
most
common
and
most
easily
observed
phenomena
and
accustom
your
pupil
not
to
consider
these
phenomena
as
reasons
but
as
facts
taking
a
stone
i
pretend
to
lay
it
upon
the
air
opening
my
hand
the
stone
falls
looking
at
émile
who
is
watching
my
motions
i
say
to
him
why
did
the
stone
fall
no
child
will
hesitate
in
answering
such
a
question
not
even
émile
unless
i
have
taken
great
care
that
he
shall
not
know
how
any
child
will
say
that
the
stone
falls
because
it
is
heavy
and
what
does
heavy
mean
whatever
falls
is
heavy
here
my
little
philosopher
is
really
at
a
stand
whether
this
first
lesson
in
experimental
physics
aids
him
in
understanding
that
subject
or
not
it
will
always
be
a
practical
lesson
nothing
to
be
taken
upon
authority
learning
from
the
pupil
own
necessities
as
the
child
understanding
matures
other
important
considerations
demand
that
we
choose
his
occupations
with
more
care
as
soon
as
he
understands
himself
and
all
that
relates
to
him
well
enough
and
broadly
enough
to
discern
what
is
to
his
advantage
and
what
is
becoming
in
him
he
can
appreciate
the
difference
between
work
and
play
and
to
regard
the
one
solely
as
relaxation
from
the
other
objects
really
useful
may
then
be
included
among
his
studies
and
he
will
pay
more
attention
to
them
than
if
amusement
alone
were
concerned
the
law
of
necessity
early
teaches
us
to
do
what
we
dislike
to
escape
evils
we
should
dislike
even
more
such
is
the
use
of
foresight
from
which
judicious
or
injudicious
springs
all
the
wisdom
or
all
the
unhappiness
of
mankind
we
all
long
for
happiness
but
to
acquire
it
we
ought
first
to
know
what
it
is
to
the
natural
man
it
is
as
simple
as
his
mode
of
life
it
means
health
liberty
and
the
necessaries
of
life
and
freedom
from
suffering
the
happiness
of
man
as
a
moral
being
is
another
thing
foreign
to
the
present
question
i
can
not
too
often
repeat
that
only
objects
purely
physical
can
interest
children
especially
those
who
have
not
had
their
vanity
aroused
and
their
nature
corrupted
by
the
poison
of
opinion
when
they
provide
beforehand
for
their
own
wants
their
understanding
is
somewhat
developed
and
they
are
beginning
to
learn
the
value
of
time
we
ought
then
by
all
means
to
accustom
and
to
direct
them
to
its
employment
to
useful
ends
these
being
such
as
are
useful
at
their
age
and
readily
understood
by
them
the
subject
of
moral
order
and
the
usages
of
society
should
not
yet
be
presented
because
children
are
not
in
a
condition
to
understand
such
things
to
force
their
attention
upon
things
which
as
we
vaguely
tell
them
will
be
for
their
good
when
they
do
not
know
what
this
good
means
is
foolish
it
is
no
less
foolish
to
assure
them
that
such
things
will
benefit
them
when
grown
for
they
take
no
interest
in
this
supposed
benefit
which
they
can
not
understand
let
the
child
take
nothing
for
granted
because
some
one
says
it
is
so
nothing
is
good
to
him
but
what
he
feels
to
be
good
you
think
it
far
sighted
to
push
him
beyond
his
understanding
of
things
but
you
are
mistaken
for
the
sake
of
arming
him
with
weapons
he
does
not
know
how
to
use
you
take
from
him
one
universal
among
men
common
sense
you
teach
him
to
allow
himself
always
to
be
led
never
to
be
more
than
a
machine
in
the
hands
of
others
if
you
will
have
him
docile
while
he
is
young
you
will
make
him
a
credulous
dupe
when
he
is
a
man
you
are
continually
saying
to
him
all
i
require
of
you
is
for
your
own
good
but
you
can
not
understand
it
yet
what
does
it
matter
to
me
whether
you
do
what
i
require
or
not
you
are
doing
it
entirely
for
your
own
sake
with
such
fine
speeches
you
are
paving
the
way
for
some
kind
of
trickster
or
fool
some
visionary
babbler
or
charlatan
who
will
entrap
him
or
persuade
him
to
adopt
his
own
folly
a
man
may
be
well
acquainted
with
things
whose
utility
a
child
can
not
comprehend
but
is
it
right
or
even
possible
for
a
child
to
learn
what
a
man
ought
to
know
try
to
teach
the
child
all
that
is
useful
to
him
now
and
you
will
keep
him
busy
all
the
time
why
would
you
injure
the
studies
suitable
to
him
at
his
age
by
giving
him
those
of
an
age
he
may
never
attain
but
you
say
will
there
be
time
for
learning
what
he
ought
to
know
when
the
time
to
use
it
has
already
come
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
sure
that
he
can
not
learn
it
sooner
for
experience
and
feeling
are
our
real
teachers
and
we
never
understand
thoroughly
what
is
best
for
us
except
from
the
circumstances
of
our
case
a
child
knows
that
he
will
one
day
be
a
man
all
the
ideas
of
manhood
that
he
can
understand
give
us
opportunities
of
teaching
him
but
of
those
he
can
not
understand
he
should
remain
in
absolute
ignorance
this
entire
book
is
only
a
continued
demonstration
of
this
principle
of
education
finding
out
the
east
the
forest
of
montmorency
i
do
not
like
explanatory
lectures
young
people
pay
very
little
attention
to
them
and
seldom
remember
them
things
things
i
can
not
repeat
often
enough
that
we
attach
too
much
importance
to
words
our
babbling
education
produces
nothing
but
babblers
suppose
that
while
we
are
studying
the
course
of
the
sun
and
the
manner
of
finding
where
the
east
is
émile
all
at
once
interrupts
me
to
ask
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
what
an
opportunity
for
a
fine
discourse
how
many
things
i
could
tell
him
of
in
answering
this
question
especially
if
anybody
were
by
to
listen
i
could
mention
the
advantages
of
travel
and
of
commerce
the
peculiar
products
of
each
climate
the
manners
of
different
nations
the
use
of
the
calendar
the
calculation
of
seasons
in
agriculture
the
art
of
navigation
and
the
manner
of
travelling
by
sea
following
the
true
course
without
knowing
where
we
are
i
might
take
up
politics
natural
history
astronomy
even
ethics
and
international
law
by
way
of
giving
my
pupil
an
exalted
idea
of
all
these
sciences
and
a
strong
desire
to
learn
them
when
i
have
done
the
boy
will
not
have
understood
a
single
idea
out
of
all
my
pedantic
display
he
would
like
to
ask
again
what
is
the
use
of
finding
out
where
the
east
is
but
dares
not
lest
i
might
be
angry
he
finds
it
more
to
his
interest
to
pretend
to
understand
what
he
has
been
compelled
to
hear
this
is
not
at
all
an
uncommon
case
in
superior
education
but
our
émile
brought
up
more
like
a
rustic
and
carefully
taught
to
think
very
slowly
will
not
listen
to
all
this
he
will
run
away
at
the
first
word
he
does
not
understand
and
play
about
the
room
leaving
me
to
harangue
all
by
myself
let
us
find
a
simpler
way
this
scientific
display
does
him
no
good
we
were
noticing
the
position
of
the
forest
north
of
montmorency
when
he
interrupted
me
with
the
eager
question
what
is
the
use
of
knowing
that
you
may
be
right
said
i
we
must
take
time
to
think
about
it
and
if
there
is
really
no
use
in
it
we
will
not
try
it
again
for
we
have
enough
to
do
that
is
of
use
we
went
at
something
else
and
there
was
no
more
geography
that
day
the
next
morning
i
proposed
a
walk
before
breakfast
nothing
could
have
pleased
him
better
children
are
always
ready
to
run
about
and
this
boy
had
sturdy
legs
of
his
own
we
went
into
the
forest
and
wandered
over
the
fields
we
lost
ourselves
having
no
idea
where
we
were
and
when
we
intended
to
go
home
could
not
find
our
way
time
passed
the
heat
of
the
day
came
on
we
were
hungry
in
vain
did
we
hurry
about
from
place
to
place
we
found
everywhere
nothing
but
woods
quarries
plains
and
not
a
landmark
that
we
knew
heated
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
very
hungry
our
running
about
only
led
us
more
and
more
astray
at
last
we
sat
down
to
rest
and
to
think
the
matter
over
émile
like
any
other
child
did
not
think
about
it
he
cried
he
did
not
know
that
we
were
near
the
gate
of
montmorency
and
that
only
a
narrow
strip
of
woodland
hid
it
from
us
but
to
him
this
narrow
strip
of
woodland
was
a
whole
forest
one
of
his
stature
would
be
lost
to
sight
among
bushes
after
some
moments
of
silence
i
said
to
him
with
a
troubled
air
my
dear
émile
what
shall
we
do
to
get
away
from
here
émile
a
profuse
perspiration
and
crying
i
know
i
tired
i
hungry
i
thirsty
i
ca
do
anything
jean
jacques
do
you
think
i
am
better
off
than
you
or
that
i
would
mind
crying
too
if
crying
would
do
for
my
breakfast
there
is
no
use
in
crying
the
thing
is
to
find
our
way
let
me
see
your
watch
what
time
is
it
émile
it
is
twelve
and
i
have
had
my
breakfast
jean
jacques
that
is
true
it
is
twelve
and
i
have
had
my
breakfast
either
émile
oh
how
hungry
you
must
be
jean
jacques
the
worst
of
it
is
that
my
dinner
will
not
come
here
to
find
me
twelve
it
was
just
this
time
yesterday
that
we
noticed
where
montmorency
is
could
we
see
where
it
is
just
as
well
from
this
forest
émile
yea
but
yesterday
we
saw
the
forest
and
we
can
not
see
the
town
from
this
place
jean
jacques
that
is
a
pity
i
wonder
if
we
could
find
out
where
it
is
without
seeing
it
émile
oh
my
dear
friend
jean
jacques
did
not
we
say
that
this
forest
is
émile
north
of
montmorency
jean
jacques
if
that
is
true
montmorency
must
be
émile
south
of
the
forest
jean
jacques
there
is
a
way
of
finding
out
the
north
at
noon
émile
yes
by
the
direction
of
our
shadows
jean
jacques
but
the
south
émile
how
can
we
find
that
jean
jacques
the
south
is
opposite
the
north
émile
that
is
true
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
find
the
side
opposite
the
shadows
oh
there
the
south
there
the
south
montmorency
must
surely
be
on
that
side
let
us
look
on
that
side
jean
jacques
perhaps
you
are
right
let
us
take
this
path
through
the
forest
émile
his
hands
with
a
joyful
oh
i
see
montmorency
there
it
is
just
before
us
in
plain
sight
let
us
go
to
our
breakfast
our
dinner
let
us
run
fast
astronomy
is
good
for
something
observe
that
even
if
he
does
not
utter
these
last
words
they
will
be
in
his
mind
it
matters
little
so
long
as
it
is
not
i
who
utter
them
rest
assured
that
he
will
never
in
his
life
forget
this
day
lesson
now
if
i
had
only
made
him
imagine
it
all
indoors
my
lecture
would
have
been
entirely
forgotten
by
the
next
day
we
should
teach
as
much
as
possible
by
actions
and
say
only
what
we
can
not
do
robinson
crusoe
in
his
legitimate
preference
for
teaching
by
the
eye
and
hand
and
by
real
things
and
in
his
aversion
to
the
barren
and
erroneous
method
of
teaching
from
books
alone
rousseau
constantly
carried
away
by
the
passionate
ardor
of
his
nature
rushes
into
an
opposite
extreme
and
exclaims
i
hate
books
they
only
teach
us
to
talk
about
what
we
do
not
understand
then
checked
in
the
full
tide
of
this
declamation
by
his
own
good
sense
he
adds
since
we
must
have
books
there
is
one
which
to
my
mind
furnishes
the
finest
of
treatises
on
education
according
to
nature
my
émile
shall
read
this
book
before
any
other
it
shall
for
a
long
time
be
his
entire
library
and
shall
always
hold
an
honorable
place
it
shall
be
the
text
on
which
all
our
discussions
of
natural
science
shall
be
only
commentaries
it
shall
be
a
test
for
all
we
meet
during
our
progress
toward
a
ripened
judgment
and
so
long
as
our
taste
is
unspoiled
we
shall
enjoy
reading
it
what
wonderful
book
is
this
aristotle
pliny
buffon
no
it
is
robinson
crusoe
the
story
of
this
man
alone
on
his
island
unaided
by
his
without
any
art
or
its
implements
and
yet
providing
for
his
own
preservation
and
subsistence
even
contriving
to
live
in
what
might
be
called
comfort
is
interesting
to
persons
of
all
ages
it
may
be
made
delightful
to
children
in
a
thousand
ways
thus
we
make
the
desert
island
which
i
used
at
the
outset
for
a
comparison
a
reality
this
condition
is
not
i
grant
that
of
man
in
society
and
to
all
appearance
émile
will
never
occupy
it
but
from
it
he
ought
to
judge
of
all
others
the
surest
way
to
rise
above
prejudice
and
to
judge
of
things
in
their
true
relations
is
to
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
an
isolated
man
and
decide
as
he
must
concerning
their
real
utility
disencumbered
of
its
less
profitable
portions
this
romance
from
its
beginning
the
shipwreck
of
crusoe
on
the
island
to
its
end
the
arrival
of
the
vessel
which
takes
him
away
will
yield
amusement
and
instruction
to
émile
during
the
period
now
in
question
i
would
have
him
completely
carried
away
by
it
continually
thinking
of
fort
his
goats
and
his
plantations
i
would
have
him
learn
not
from
books
but
from
real
things
all
he
would
need
to
know
under
the
same
circumstances
he
should
be
encouraged
to
play
robinson
crusoe
to
imagine
himself
clad
in
skins
wearing
a
great
cap
and
sword
and
all
the
array
of
that
grotesque
figure
down
to
the
umbrella
of
which
he
would
have
no
need
if
he
happens
to
be
in
want
of
anything
i
hope
he
will
contrive
something
to
supply
its
place
let
him
look
carefully
into
all
that
his
hero
did
and
decide
whether
any
of
it
was
unnecessary
or
might
have
been
done
in
a
better
way
let
him
notice
crusoe
mistakes
and
avoid
them
under
like
circumstances
he
will
very
likely
plan
for
himself
surroundings
like
crusoe
a
real
castle
in
the
air
natural
at
his
happy
age
when
we
think
ourselves
rich
if
we
are
free
and
have
the
necessaries
of
life
how
useful
this
hobby
might
be
made
if
some
man
of
sense
would
only
suggest
it
and
turn
it
to
good
account
the
child
eager
to
build
a
storehouse
for
his
island
would
be
more
desirous
to
learn
than
his
master
would
be
to
teach
him
he
would
be
anxious
to
know
everything
he
could
make
use
of
and
nothing
besides
you
would
not
need
to
guide
but
to
restrain
him
here
rousseau
insists
upon
giving
a
child
some
trade
no
matter
what
his
station
in
life
may
be
and
in
he
uttered
these
prophetic
words
remarkable
indeed
when
we
call
to
mind
the
disorders
at
the
close
of
that
century
you
trust
to
the
present
condition
of
society
without
reflecting
that
it
is
subject
to
unavoidable
revolutions
and
that
you
can
neither
foresee
nor
prevent
what
is
to
affect
the
fate
of
your
own
children
the
great
are
brought
low
the
poor
are
made
rich
the
king
becomes
a
subject
are
the
blows
of
fate
so
uncommon
that
you
can
expect
to
escape
them
we
are
approaching
a
crisis
the
age
of
revolutions
who
can
tell
what
will
become
of
you
then
all
that
man
has
done
man
may
destroy
no
characters
but
those
stamped
by
nature
are
ineffaceable
and
nature
did
not
make
princes
or
rich
men
or
nobles
this
advice
was
followed
in
the
highest
grades
of
society
it
became
the
fashion
to
learn
some
handicraft
it
is
well
known
that
louis
xvi
was
proud
of
his
skill
as
a
locksmith
among
the
exiles
of
a
later
period
many
owed
their
living
to
the
trade
they
had
thus
learned
to
return
to
émile
rousseau
selects
for
him
the
trade
of
a
joiner
and
goes
so
far
as
to
employ
him
and
his
tutor
in
that
kind
of
labor
for
one
or
more
days
of
every
week
under
a
master
who
pays
them
actual
wages
for
their
work
judging
from
appearances
the
broken
stick
if
i
have
thus
far
made
myself
understood
you
may
see
how
with
regular
physical
exercise
and
manual
labor
i
am
at
the
same
time
giving
my
pupil
a
taste
for
reflection
and
meditation
this
will
counterbalance
the
indolence
which
might
result
from
his
indifference
to
other
men
and
from
the
dormant
state
of
his
passions
he
must
work
like
a
peasant
and
think
like
a
philosopher
or
he
will
be
as
idle
as
a
savage
the
great
secret
of
education
is
to
make
physical
and
mental
exercises
serve
as
relaxation
for
each
other
at
first
our
pupil
had
nothing
but
sensations
and
now
he
has
ideas
then
he
only
perceived
but
now
he
judges
for
from
comparison
of
many
successive
or
simultaneous
sensations
with
the
judgments
based
on
them
arises
a
kind
of
mixed
or
complex
sensation
which
i
call
an
idea
the
different
manner
in
which
ideas
are
formed
gives
each
mind
its
peculiar
character
a
mind
is
solid
if
it
shape
its
ideas
according
to
the
true
relations
of
things
superficial
if
content
with
their
apparent
relations
accurate
if
it
behold
things
as
they
really
are
unsound
if
it
understand
them
incorrectly
disordered
if
it
fabricate
imaginary
relations
neither
apparent
nor
real
imbecile
if
it
do
not
compare
ideas
at
all
greater
or
less
mental
power
in
different
men
consists
in
their
greater
or
less
readiness
in
comparing
ideas
and
discovering
their
relations
from
simple
as
well
as
complex
sensations
we
form
judgments
which
i
will
call
simple
ideas
in
a
sensation
the
judgment
is
wholly
passive
only
affirming
that
we
feel
what
we
feel
in
a
preception
or
idea
the
judgment
is
active
it
brings
together
compares
and
determines
relations
not
determined
by
the
senses
this
is
the
only
point
of
difference
but
it
is
important
nature
never
deceives
us
it
is
always
we
who
deceive
ourselves
i
see
a
child
eight
years
old
helped
to
some
frozen
custard
without
knowing
what
it
is
he
puts
a
spoonful
in
his
mouth
and
feeling
the
cold
sensation
exclaims
ah
that
burns
he
feels
a
keen
sensation
he
knows
of
none
more
so
than
heat
and
thinks
that
is
what
he
now
feels
he
is
of
course
mistaken
the
chill
is
painful
but
does
not
burn
him
and
the
two
sensations
are
not
alike
since
after
encountering
both
we
never
mistake
one
for
the
other
it
is
not
therefore
the
sensation
which
misleads
him
but
the
judgment
based
on
it
it
is
the
same
when
any
one
sees
for
the
first
time
a
mirror
or
optical
apparatus
or
enters
a
deep
cellar
in
or
midsummer
or
plunges
his
hand
either
very
warm
or
very
cold
into
tepid
water
or
rolls
a
little
ball
between
two
of
his
fingers
held
crosswise
if
he
is
satisfied
with
describing
what
he
perceives
or
feels
keeping
his
judgment
in
abeyance
he
can
not
be
mistaken
but
when
he
decides
upon
appearances
his
judgment
is
active
it
compares
and
infers
relations
it
does
not
perceive
and
it
may
then
be
mistaken
he
will
need
experience
to
prevent
or
correct
such
mistakes
show
your
pupil
clouds
passing
over
the
moon
at
night
and
he
will
think
that
the
moon
is
moving
in
an
opposite
direction
and
that
the
clouds
are
at
rest
he
will
the
more
readily
infer
that
this
is
the
case
because
he
usually
sees
small
objects
not
large
ones
in
motion
and
because
the
clouds
seem
to
him
larger
than
the
moon
of
whose
distance
he
has
no
idea
when
from
a
moving
boat
he
sees
the
shore
at
a
little
distance
he
makes
the
contrary
mistake
of
thinking
that
the
earth
moves
for
unconscious
of
his
own
motion
the
boat
the
water
and
the
entire
horizon
seem
to
him
one
immovable
whole
of
which
the
moving
shore
is
only
one
part
the
first
time
a
child
sees
a
stick
half
immersed
in
water
it
seems
to
be
broken
the
sensation
is
a
true
one
and
would
be
even
if
we
did
not
know
the
reason
for
this
appearance
if
therefore
you
ask
him
what
he
sees
he
answers
truly
a
broken
stick
because
he
is
fully
conscious
of
the
sensation
of
a
broken
stick
but
when
deceived
by
his
judgment
he
goes
farther
and
after
saying
that
he
sees
a
broken
stick
he
says
again
that
the
stick
really
is
broken
he
says
what
is
not
true
and
why
because
his
judgment
becomes
active
he
decides
no
longer
from
observation
but
from
inference
when
he
declares
as
a
fact
what
he
does
not
actually
perceive
namely
that
touch
would
confirm
the
judgment
based
upon
sight
alone
the
best
way
of
learning
to
judge
correctly
is
the
one
which
tends
to
simplify
our
experience
and
enables
us
to
make
no
mistakes
even
when
we
dispense
with
experience
altogether
it
follows
from
this
that
after
having
long
verified
the
testimony
of
one
sense
by
that
of
another
we
must
further
learn
to
verify
the
testimony
of
each
sense
by
itself
without
appeal
to
any
other
then
each
sensation
at
once
becomes
an
idea
and
an
idea
in
accordance
with
the
truth
with
such
acquisitions
i
have
endeavored
to
store
this
third
period
of
human
life
to
follow
this
plan
requires
a
patience
and
a
circumspection
of
which
few
teachers
are
capable
and
without
which
a
pupil
will
never
learn
to
judge
correctly
for
example
if
when
he
is
misled
by
the
appearance
of
a
broken
stick
you
endeavor
to
show
him
his
mistake
by
taking
the
stick
quickly
out
of
the
water
you
may
perhaps
undeceive
him
but
what
will
you
teach
him
nothing
he
might
not
have
learned
for
himself
you
ought
not
thus
to
teach
him
one
detached
truth
instead
of
showing
him
how
he
may
always
discover
for
himself
any
truth
if
you
really
mean
to
teach
him
do
not
at
once
undeceive
him
let
émile
and
myself
serve
you
for
example
in
the
first
place
any
child
educated
in
the
ordinary
way
would
to
the
second
of
the
two
questions
above
mentioned
answer
of
course
the
stick
is
broken
i
doubt
whether
émile
would
give
this
answer
seeing
no
need
of
being
learned
or
of
appearing
learned
he
never
judges
hastily
but
only
from
evidence
knowing
how
easily
appearances
deceive
us
as
in
the
case
of
perspective
he
is
far
from
finding
the
evidence
in
the
present
case
sufficient
besides
knowing
from
experience
that
my
most
trivial
question
always
has
an
object
which
he
does
not
at
once
discover
he
is
not
in
the
habit
of
giving
heedless
answers
on
the
contrary
he
is
on
his
guard
and
attentive
he
looks
into
the
matter
very
carefully
before
replying
he
never
gives
me
an
answer
with
which
he
is
not
himself
satisfied
and
he
is
not
easily
satisfied
moreover
he
and
i
do
not
pride
ourselves
on
knowing
facts
exactly
but
only
on
making
few
mistakes
we
should
be
much
more
disconcerted
if
we
found
ourselves
satisfied
with
an
insufficient
reason
than
if
we
had
discovered
none
at
all
the
confession
i
do
not
know
suits
us
both
so
well
and
we
repeat
it
so
often
that
it
costs
neither
of
us
anything
but
whether
for
this
once
he
is
careless
or
avoids
the
difficulty
by
a
convenient
i
do
not
know
my
answer
is
the
same
let
us
see
let
us
find
out
the
stick
in
the
water
is
fixed
in
a
vertical
position
to
find
out
whether
it
is
broken
as
it
appears
to
be
how
much
we
must
do
before
we
take
it
out
of
the
water
or
even
touch
it
first
we
go
entirely
round
it
and
observe
that
the
fracture
goes
around
with
us
it
is
our
eye
alone
then
that
changes
it
and
a
glance
can
not
move
things
from
place
to
place
secondly
we
look
directly
down
the
stick
from
the
end
outside
of
the
water
then
the
stick
is
no
longer
bent
because
the
end
next
our
eye
exactly
hides
the
other
end
from
us
has
our
eye
straightened
the
stick
thirdly
we
stir
the
surface
of
the
water
and
see
the
stick
bend
itself
into
several
curves
move
in
a
direction
and
follow
the
undulations
of
the
water
has
the
motion
we
gave
the
water
been
enough
thus
to
break
to
soften
and
to
melt
the
stick
fourth
we
draw
off
the
water
and
see
the
stick
straighten
itself
as
fast
as
the
water
is
lowered
is
not
this
more
than
enough
to
illustrate
the
fact
and
to
find
out
the
refraction
it
is
not
then
true
that
the
eye
deceives
us
since
by
its
aid
alone
we
can
correct
the
mistakes
we
ascribe
to
it
suppose
the
child
so
dull
as
not
to
understand
the
result
of
these
experiments
then
we
must
call
touch
to
the
aid
of
sight
instead
of
taking
the
stick
out
of
the
water
leave
it
there
and
let
him
pass
his
hand
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
he
will
feel
no
angle
the
stick
therefore
is
not
broken
you
will
tell
me
that
these
are
not
only
judgments
but
formal
reasonings
true
but
do
you
not
see
that
as
soon
as
the
mind
has
attained
to
ideas
all
judgment
is
reasoning
the
consciousness
of
any
sensation
is
a
proposition
a
judgment
as
soon
therefore
as
we
compare
one
sensation
with
another
we
reason
the
art
of
judging
and
the
art
of
reasoning
are
precisely
the
same
if
from
the
lesson
of
this
stick
émile
does
not
understand
the
idea
of
refraction
he
will
never
understand
it
at
all
he
shall
never
dissect
insects
or
count
the
spots
on
the
sun
he
shall
not
even
know
what
a
microscope
or
a
telescope
is
your
learned
pupils
will
laugh
at
his
ignorance
and
will
not
be
very
far
wrong
for
before
he
uses
these
instruments
i
intend
he
shall
invent
them
and
you
may
well
suppose
that
this
will
not
be
soon
done
this
shall
be
the
spirit
of
all
my
methods
of
teaching
during
this
period
if
the
child
rolls
a
bullet
between
two
crossed
fingers
i
will
not
let
him
look
at
it
till
he
is
otherwise
convinced
that
there
is
only
one
bullet
there
result
the
pupil
at
the
age
of
fifteen
i
think
these
explanations
will
suffice
to
mark
distinctly
the
advance
my
pupil
mind
has
hitherto
made
and
the
route
by
which
he
has
advanced
you
are
probably
alarmed
at
the
number
of
subjects
i
have
brought
to
his
notice
you
are
afraid
i
will
overwhelm
his
mind
with
all
this
knowledge
but
i
teach
him
rather
not
to
know
them
than
to
know
them
i
am
showing
him
a
path
to
knowledge
not
indeed
difficult
but
without
limit
slowly
measured
long
or
rather
endless
and
tedious
to
follow
i
am
showing
him
how
to
take
the
first
steps
so
that
he
may
know
its
beginning
but
allow
him
to
go
no
farther
obliged
to
learn
by
his
own
effort
he
employs
his
own
reason
not
that
of
another
most
of
our
mistakes
arise
less
within
ourselves
than
from
others
so
that
if
he
is
not
to
be
ruled
by
opinion
he
must
receive
nothing
upon
authority
such
continual
exercise
must
invigorate
the
mind
as
labor
and
fatigue
strengthen
the
body
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
can
bear
only
what
its
strength
will
allow
when
the
understanding
fully
masters
a
thing
before
intrusting
it
to
the
memory
what
it
afterward
draws
therefrom
is
in
reality
its
own
but
if
instead
we
load
the
memory
with
matters
the
understanding
has
not
mastered
we
run
the
risk
of
never
finding
there
anything
that
belongs
to
it
émile
has
little
knowledge
but
it
is
really
his
own
he
knows
nothing
by
halves
and
the
most
important
fact
is
that
he
does
not
now
know
things
he
will
one
day
know
that
many
things
known
to
other
people
he
never
will
know
and
that
there
is
an
infinity
of
things
which
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
ever
will
know
he
is
prepared
for
knowledge
of
every
kind
not
because
he
has
so
much
but
because
he
knows
how
to
acquire
it
his
mind
is
open
to
it
and
as
montaigne
says
if
not
taught
he
is
at
least
teachable
i
shall
be
satisfied
if
he
knows
how
to
find
out
the
wherefore
of
everything
he
knows
and
the
why
of
everything
he
believes
i
repeat
that
my
object
is
not
to
give
him
knowledge
but
to
teach
him
how
to
acquire
it
at
need
to
estimate
it
at
its
true
value
and
above
all
things
to
love
the
truth
by
this
method
we
advance
slowly
but
take
no
useless
steps
and
are
not
obliged
to
retrace
a
single
one
émile
understands
only
the
natural
and
purely
physical
sciences
he
does
not
even
know
the
name
of
history
or
the
meaning
of
metaphysics
and
ethics
he
knows
the
essential
relations
between
men
and
things
but
nothing
of
the
moral
relations
between
man
and
man
he
does
not
readily
generalize
or
conceive
of
abstractions
he
observes
the
qualities
common
to
certain
bodies
without
reasoning
about
the
qualities
themselves
with
the
aid
of
geometric
figures
and
algebraic
signs
he
knows
something
of
extension
and
quantity
upon
these
figures
and
signs
his
senses
rest
their
knowledge
of
the
abstractions
just
named
he
makes
no
attempt
to
learn
the
nature
of
things
but
only
such
of
their
relations
as
concern
himself
he
estimates
external
things
only
by
their
relation
to
him
but
this
estimate
is
exact
and
positive
and
in
it
fancies
and
conventionalities
have
no
share
he
values
most
those
things
that
are
most
useful
to
him
and
never
deviating
from
this
standard
is
not
influenced
by
general
opinion
émile
is
industrious
temperate
patient
steadfast
and
full
of
courage
his
imagination
never
aroused
does
not
exaggerate
dangers
he
feels
few
discomforts
and
can
bear
pain
with
fortitude
because
he
has
never
learned
to
contend
with
fate
he
does
not
yet
know
exactly
what
death
is
but
accustomed
to
yield
to
the
law
of
necessity
he
will
die
when
he
must
without
a
groan
or
a
struggle
nature
can
do
no
more
at
that
moment
abhorred
by
all
to
live
free
and
to
have
little
to
do
with
human
affairs
is
the
best
way
of
learning
how
to
die
in
a
word
émile
has
every
virtue
which
affects
himself
to
have
the
social
virtues
as
well
he
only
needs
to
know
the
relations
which
make
them
necessary
and
this
knowledge
his
mind
is
ready
to
receive
he
considers
himself
independently
of
others
and
is
satisfied
when
others
do
not
think
of
him
at
all
he
exacts
nothing
from
others
and
never
thinks
of
owing
anything
to
them
he
is
alone
in
human
society
and
depends
solely
upon
himself
he
has
the
best
right
of
all
to
be
independent
for
he
is
all
that
any
one
can
be
at
his
age
he
has
no
errors
but
such
as
a
human
being
must
have
no
vices
but
those
from
which
no
one
can
warrant
himself
exempt
he
has
a
sound
constitution
active
limbs
a
fair
and
unprejudiced
mind
a
heart
free
and
without
passions
the
first
and
most
natural
of
all
has
scarcely
manifested
itself
at
all
without
disturbing
any
one
peace
of
mind
he
has
led
a
happy
contented
life
as
free
as
nature
will
allow
do
you
think
a
youth
who
has
thus
attained
his
fifteenth
year
has
lost
the
years
that
have
gone
before
this
might
be
carried
too
far
and
is
to
be
admitted
with
some
reservations
ignorance
is
never
alone
its
companions
are
always
error
and
presumption
no
one
is
so
certain
that
he
knows
as
he
who
knows
nothing
and
prejudice
of
all
kinds
is
the
form
in
which
our
ignorance
is
clothed
the
armillary
sphere
is
a
group
of
pasteboard
or
copper
circles
to
illustrate
the
orbits
of
the
planets
and
their
position
in
relation
to
the
earth
which
is
represented
by
a
small
wooden
ball
the
imaginary
circles
traced
on
the
celestial
sphere
and
figured
in
the
armillary
sphere
by
metallic
circles
are
called
rousseau
here
informs
his
readers
that
even
these
reproaches
are
expected
he
having
dictated
them
beforehand
to
the
mountebank
all
this
scene
has
been
arranged
to
deceive
the
child
what
a
refinement
of
artifice
in
this
passionate
lover
of
the
natural
