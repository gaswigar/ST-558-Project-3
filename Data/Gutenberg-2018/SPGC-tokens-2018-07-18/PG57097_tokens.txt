dedication
to
harry
hooton
when
i
sat
down
at
the
dolau
cothi
arms
this
evening
i
remembered
my
dedication
to
you
you
said
i
could
dedicate
this
book
to
you
if
i
would
make
a
real
dedication
not
one
of
my
shadowy
salutes
befitting
shadows
rather
than
men
and
women
it
seems
odd
you
should
ask
thus
for
a
sovereign
s
worth
of
shall
i
say
english
prose
from
a
writer
by
trade
but
though
i
turn
out
a
large
if
insufficient
number
of
sovereigns
worths
and
am
become
a
writing
animal
and
could
write
something
or
other
about
a
broomstick
i
do
not
write
with
ease
so
let
that
difficulty
give
the
dedication
its
value
it
is
right
that
i
should
remember
you
upon
a
walk
for
i
have
walked
more
miles
with
you
than
with
anyone
else
except
myself
while
i
walked
you
very
often
danced
on
the
roads
of
kent
sussex
surrey
and
hampshire
this
evening
when
i
went
out
on
the
sarn
helen
everybody
was
in
chapel
i
think
unless
it
was
the
lord
for
he
also
seemed
to
me
to
be
walking
in
the
cool
i
was
very
much
alone
and
glad
to
be
you
were
a
ghost
and
not
a
man
of
fourteen
stone
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
after
all
that
shadowy
salute
would
be
fittest
but
i
have
put
my
pen
to
paper
i
have
set
out
and
i
will
come
to
an
end
for
as
i
said
i
am
a
writing
animal
in
the
days
of
those
old
walks
i
could
have
written
a
dedication
in
norfolk
jacket
style
all
about
the
open
road
and
the
search
for
something
over
the
hills
and
far
away
i
should
have
reminded
you
at
some
length
how
borrow
stayed
at
this
inn
and
that
dolau
cothi
is
the
house
where
he
could
have
lived
with
satisfaction
if
backed
by
a
couple
of
thousands
a
i
know
there
is
nothing
beyond
the
farthest
of
far
ridges
except
a
signpost
to
unknown
places
the
end
is
in
the
means
in
the
sight
of
that
beautiful
long
straight
line
of
the
downs
in
which
a
curve
is
latent
in
the
houses
we
shall
never
enter
with
their
dark
secret
windows
and
quiet
hearth
smoke
or
their
ruins
friendly
only
to
elders
and
nettles
in
the
people
passing
whom
we
shall
never
know
though
we
may
love
them
i
know
that
i
walk
because
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
both
to
live
and
to
make
a
living
once
those
walks
might
have
made
a
book
now
they
make
a
smile
or
a
sigh
and
i
am
glad
they
are
in
ghostland
and
not
fettered
in
useless
print
this
book
for
you
was
to
have
been
a
country
book
but
i
see
that
it
has
turned
out
to
be
another
of
those
books
made
out
of
books
founded
on
other
books
being
but
half
mine
it
can
only
be
half
yours
and
i
owe
you
an
apology
as
well
as
a
dedication
it
is
however
in
some
ways
a
fitting
book
for
me
to
write
for
it
is
about
a
road
which
begins
many
miles
before
i
could
come
on
its
traces
and
ends
miles
beyond
where
i
had
to
stop
i
could
find
no
excuse
for
supposing
it
to
go
to
wales
and
following
it
there
into
the
ceidrych
valley
along
the
towy
to
caermarthen
and
so
to
david
s
which
is
now
as
holy
as
rome
though
once
only
a
third
as
holy
apparently
no
special
medi√¶val
use
revived
it
throughout
its
course
or
gave
it
a
new
entity
like
that
of
the
pilgrims
way
from
winchester
to
canterbury
that
you
and
i
walked
on
many
a
time
by
the
cock
at
detling
the
black
horse
at
thurnham
the
king
s
head
once
i
believe
the
pilgrims
rest
at
hollingbourne
above
harrietsham
past
deodara
villas
above
lenham
and
robert
philpot
s
woodman
s
arms
and
so
on
to
eastwell
always
among
beech
and
yew
and
canterbury
bells
and
always
over
the
silver
of
whitebeam
leaves
i
could
not
find
a
beginning
or
an
end
of
the
icknield
way
it
is
thus
a
symbol
of
mortal
things
with
their
beginnings
and
ends
always
in
immortal
darkness
i
wish
the
book
had
a
little
more
of
the
mystery
of
the
road
about
it
you
at
least
will
make
allowances
and
additions
and
god
send
me
many
other
readers
like
you
and
as
this
is
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
and
ale
is
better
than
ink
though
it
is
no
substitute
i
label
this
dedication
and
wish
you

me

note
i
have
to
acknowledge
the
very
great
kindness
of
hilaire
belloc
harold
peake
and
hippisley
cox
while
i
was
writing
this
book
though
i
do
so
with
some
hesitation
because
i
may
seem
to
make
them
responsible
for
some
of
my
possible
mistakes
and
certain
shortcomings
a
man
could
hardly
have
three
better
guides
than
belloc
for
his
grasp
and
sympathy
with
roads
peake
for
his
caution
and
curiosity
and
documents
documents
and
cox
for
his
ardour
and
familiarity
with
trodden
turf
and
i
must
add
my
testimony
to
that
of
my
betters
to
the
merits
of
belloc
s
peake
s
chapter
on
prehistoric
roads
in
of

i
am

that
were
invaluable
to
me
notably
in
the
matter
of

chapter
i
on
roads
and
footpaths
much
has
been
written
of
travel
far
less
of
the
road
writers
have
treated
the
road
as
a
passive
means
to
an
end
and
honoured
it
most
when
it
has
been
an
obstacle
they
leave
the
impression
that
a
road
is
a
connection
between
two
points
which
only
exists
when
the
traveller
is
upon
it
though
there
is
much
travel
in
the
old
testament
the
way
is
used
chiefly
as
a
metaphor
abram
journeyed
going
on
still
toward
the
south
says
the
historian
who
would
have
used
the
same
words
had
the
patriarch
employed
wings
yet
to
a
nomadic
people
the
road
was
as
important
as
anything
upon
it
the
earliest
roads
wandered
like
rivers
through
the
land
having
like
rivers
one
necessity
to
keep
in
motion
we
still
say
that
a
road
goes
to
london
as
we
go
ourselves
we
point
out
a
white
snake
on
a
green
and
tell
a
man
that
is
going
to
at
our
inn
we
think
when
recollecting
the
day
that
road
must
have
gone
to
strata
we
could
not
attribute
more
life
to
them
if
we
had
moving
roads
with
platforms
on
the
sidewalks
we
may
go
or
stay
but
the
road
will
go
up
over
the
mountains
to
llandovery
and
then
up
again
over
to
tregaron
it
is
a
silent
companion
always
ready
for
us
whether
it
is
night
or
day
wet
or
fine
whether
we
are
calm
or
desperate
well
or
sick
it
is
always
going
it
has
never
gone
right
away
and
no
man
is
too
late
only
a
humorist
could
doubt
this
like
the
boy
in
a
lane
who
was
asked
where
does
this
lane
go
to
boy
and
answered
i
have
been
living
here
these
sixteen
years
and
it
has
never
moved
to
my
some
roads
creep
some
continue
merely
some
advance
with
majesty
some
mount
a
hill
in
curves
like
a
soaring
even
as
towns
are
built
by
rivers
instead
of
rivers
being
conducted
past
towns
so
the
first
settlements
grew
up
alongside
roads
which
had
formerly
existed
simply
as
the
natural
lines
of
travel
for
a
travelling
race
the
oldest
roads
often
touch
the
fewest
of
our
modern
towns
villages
and
isolated
houses
it
has
been
conjectured
that
the
first
roads
were
originally
the
tracks
of
animals
the
elephant
s
path
or
tunnel
through
the
jungle
is
used
as
a
road
in
india
and
in
early
days
the
wild
herds
must
have
been
invaluable
for
making
a
way
through
forest
for
showing
the
firmest
portions
of
bogs
and
lowland
marshes
and
for
suggesting
fords
the
herd
would
wind
according
to
the
conditions
of
the
land
and
to
inclinations
of
many
inexplicable
kinds
but
the
winding
of
the
road
would
be
no
disadvantage
to
men
who
found
their
living
by
the
wayside
men
to
whom
time
was
not
money
roads
which
grew
thus
by
nature
and
by
necessity
appear
to
be
almost
as
lasting
as
rivers
they
are
found
fit
for
the
uses
of
countless
different
generations
of
men
outside
cities
because
apart
from
cities
and
their
needs
life
changes
little
if
they
go
out
of
use
in
a
new
or
a
changed
civilization
they
may
still
be
frequented
by
men
of
the
most
primitive
habit
all
over
england
may
be
found
old
roads
called
gypsy
lane
tinker
s
lane
or
smuggler
s
lane
east
of
calne
in
wiltshire
is
a
juggler
s
lane
and
as
if
the
ugliness
of
the
uggle
sound
pleased
the
good
virtuous
country
folk
they
have
got
a
huggler
s
hole
a
little
west
of
semley
and
south
of
sedgehill
in
the
same
county
there
are
also
beggar
s
lanes
and
roads
leading
past
places
called
mock
beggar
which
is
said
to
mean
much
beggar
these
roads
are
known
to
lovers
thieves
smugglers
and
ghosts
even
if
long
neglected
they
are
not
easily
obliterated
on
the
fairly
even
and
dry
ground
of
the
high
ridges
where
men
and
cattle
could
spread
out
wide
as
they
journeyed
the
earth
itself
is
unchanged
by
centuries
of
traffic
save
that
the
grass
is
made
finer
shorter
paler
and
more
numerously
starred
with
daisies
but
on
the
slopes
down
to
a
plain
or
ford
the
road
takes
its
immortality
by
violence
for
it
is
divided
into
two
or
three
or
a
score
of
narrow
courses
trenched
so
deeply
that
they
might
often
seem
to
be
the
work
rather
of
some
fierce
natural
force
than
of
men
cattle
and
the
name
holloway
or
holway
is
therefore
a
likely
sign
of
an
old
road
so
is
sandy
lane
a
name
in
which
lurks
the
contempt
of
country
people
for
the
road
which
a
good
hard
road
has
superseded
and
now
little
used
save
in
bird
or
courting
days
these
old
roads
will
endure
as
long
as
the
roman
streets
though
great
is
the
difference
between
the
unraised
trackway
as
dim
as
a
on
the
sea
and
the
straight
embanked
roman
highway
which
made
the
proverb
plain
as
dunstable
road
or
good
plain
dunstable
for
watling
street
goes
broad
and
straight
through
that
town
scott
has
one
of
these
ghostly
old
roads
in
it
was
over
a
heath
that
had
skiddaw
and
saddleback
for
background
and
he
calls
it
a
the
track
so
slightly
marked
by
the
passengers
footsteps
that
it
can
but
be
traced
by
a
slight
shade
of
verdure
from
the
darker
heath
around
it
and
being
only
visible
to
the
eye
when
at
some
distance
ceases
to
be
distinguished
while
the
foot
is
actually
treading
the
making
of
such
roads
seems
one
of
the
most
natural
operations
of
man
one
in
which
he
least
conflicts
with
nature
and
the
animals
if
he
makes
roads
outright
and
rapidly
for
a
definite
purpose
they
may
perish
as
rapidly
like
the
new
roads
of
modern
japanese
enterprise
and
their
ancient
predecessors
live
on
to
smile
at
their
ambition
these
are
the
winding
ways
preferred
by
your
connoisseur
give
me
says
hazlitt
the
clear
blue
sky
over
my
head
and
the
green
turf
beneath
my
feet
a
winding
road
before
me
and
a
march
to
dinner
and
then
to
thinking
these
windings
are
created
by
the
undulating
of
the
land
and
by
obstacles
like
those
of
a
river
curves
such
as
those
in
the
high
street
of
oxford
which
wordsworth
called
the
windings
of
that
glorious
the
least
obstacle
might
bring
about
a
loop
if
nothing
more
and
as
even
a
roman
road
curled
round
silbury
hill
so
the
path
of
the
australian
savage
is
to
be
seen
twisting
round
bush
after
bush
as
if
it
enjoyed
the
interruption
though
it
can
not
purl
like
the
river
at
a
bend
probably
these
twists
besides
being
unconsciously
adapted
to
the
lie
of
the
land
were
as
they
are
still
easeful
and
pleasant
to
the
rover
who
had
some
natural
love
of
journeying
why
go
straight
there
is
nothing
at
the
end
of
any
road
better
than
may
be
found
beside
it
though
there
would
be
no
travel
did
men
believe
it
the
straight
road
except
over
level
and
open
country
can
only
be
made
by
those
in
whom
extreme
haste
and
forethought
have
destroyed
the
power
of
joy
either
at
the
end
or
at
any
part
of
its
course
why
then
go
straight
the
connoisseur
had
something
of
the
savage
in
him
when
he
demanded
a
winding
road
it
is
not
however
to
a
man
walking
for
pleasure
that
we
shall
go
for
a
sense
of
roads
but
to
one
like
bunyan
s
is
full
of
the
sense
of
roads
see
christian
going
to
legality
s
house
it
is
a
mountain
road
and
the
hill
overhangs
it
so
much
that
he
is
afraid
to
venture
further
lest
the
hill
should
fall
on
his
when
goodwill
points
out
the
narrow
way
he
says
it
was
cast
up
by
the
patriarchs
prophets
christ
and
his
apostles
made
into
a
raised
track
bounded
by
ditches
from
which
the
earth
was
cast
up
to
form
the
embankment
when
christian
comes
to
the
hill
difficulty
you
see
the
primitive
man
deciding
to
go
straight
uphill
turning
not
to
the
left
by
the
way
called
danger
into
a
great
wood
nor
to
the
right
to
destruction
and
the
wide
field
full
of
dark
how
full
of
plain
english
country
wayfaring
is
the
passage
where
hopeful
and
christian
take
a
road
by
a
and
then
when
it
turns
away
from
the
water
they
see
a
stile
leading
into
a
path
which
keeps
on
as
a
path
would
do
along
the
bank
through
meadow
only
as
it
happens
the
river
is
in
flood
and
they
must
turn
back
again
towards
the
stile
this
man
knew
roads
and
one
of
his
temptations
after
conversion
was
to
try
his
faith
by
bidding
the
puddles
on
the
road
between
his
own
village
and
bedford
to
be
dry
cervantes
had
the
sense
of
roads
he
begins
indeed
by
making
don
quixote
sally
forth
upon
the
plain
like
any
knight
of
chivalry
pricking
o
er
the
plain
and
taking
the
way
chosen
by
his
horse
because
thus
would
adventures
best
be
compassed
but
it
is
upon
a
road
that
he
and
most
of
his
knights
ladies
and
enchanters
travel
malory
s
book
would
have
less
vitality
in
its
marvel
if
it
were
not
for
the
roads
the
three
highways
for
example
where
sir
marhaus
and
sir
gawaine
and
sir
uwaine
were
to
separate
for
their
adventures
each
with
his
damosel
and
the
wild
ways
of
sir
launcelot
when
he
rode
many
wild
ways
throughout
marches
and
many
wild
ways
until
he
came
to
a
valley
and
a
knight
therein
with
a
naked
sword
chasing
a
lady
again
and
some
of
the
historical
plays
of
shakespeare
give
a
grand
impression
of
wide
tracts
of
country
traversed
by
roads
of
great
purpose
and
destiny
more
often
in
books
we
move
as
i
have
said
from
place
to
place
as
in
a
dream
but
it
is
a
dream
in
the
which
gives
one
of
the
most
majestic
scenes
of
travel
i
mean
the
dream
of
the
emperor
maxen
he
dreamed
that
he
was
journeying
along
a
river
valley
towards
its
source
and
up
over
the
highest
mountain
in
the
world
until
he
saw
mighty
rivers
descending
to
the
sea
and
one
of
them
he
followed
to
a
great
city
at
its
mouth
and
a
vast
castle
in
the
city
at
the
end
of
his
journey
the
dreaming
emperor
found
a
girl
so
beautiful
that
when
he
awoke
he
could
think
of
naught
else
while
years
went
by
except
her
beauty
he
sent
out
pioneers
to
discover
the
road
of
his
dream
and
at
last
they
brought
him
to
the
castle
and
the
same
girl
helen
sitting
in
the
hall
of
it
she
became
his
bride
and
he
gave
her
three
castles
one
at
arvon
in
north
wales
one
at
caerleon
and
one
at
caermarthen
in
the
south
then
says
the
tale
helen
bethought
her
to
make
from
one
castle
to
another
throughout
the
island
of
britain
and
the
roads
were
made
and
for
this
cause
are
they
called
the
roads
of
helen
luyddawc
that
she
was
sprung
from
a
native
of
this
island
and
the
men
of
the
island
of
britain
would
not
have
made
these
great
roads
for
any
save
it
is
natural
to
connect
with
this
helen
the
great
ancient
roads
leading
north
and
south
across
wales
known
as
sarn
helen
or
elen
nothing
could
be
more
noble
as
the
name
of
a
mountain
road
than
sarn
helen
or
helen
s
causeway
it
suggests
to
the
ordinary
fanciful
and
unhistoric
mind
the
british
helena
mother
of
the
emperor
constantine
and
that
it
suggested
this
long
ago
is
clear
from
the
old
identification
of
helen
luyddawc
with
the
only
child
of
king
cole
of
colchester
the
name
has
more
recently
been
explained
as
sarn
y
lleng
the
road
of
the
legions
sir
john
rhys
insists
upon
elen
instead
of
helen
and
believes
her
to
be
one
of
the
pagan
goddesses
of
the
dusk
there
is
he
says
a
certain
poetic
propriety
in
associating
the
primitive
paths
and
roads
of
the
country
with
this
vagrant
goddess
of
dawn
and
these
wandering
paths
are
to
the
hard
white
highways
what
dusk
is
to
the
full
blaze
of
day
first
perhaps
trodden
by
the
wild
herd
and
still
without
terrors
for
it
they
might
well
be
protected
by
a
sort
of
artemis
goddess
of
wildernesses
and
of
forked
ways
kind
both
to
human
hunters
and
the
wild
quarry
they
belong
to
the
twilight
of
the
world
no
doubt
the
sun
shines
no
brighter
at
noon
than
it
did
then
on
a
perfectly
wild
earth
on
flowers
that
were
never
gathered
on
bright
plumage
that
no
man
had
coveted
but
all
the
forest
and
marsh
of
primeval
earth
form
in
the
imagination
mists
to
which
the
lack
of
history
adds
yet
another
veil
these
mists
lie
over
the
world
to
my
mind
exactly
as
the
white
mist
of
summer
lies
turning
into
a
sea
most
of
what
once
was
land
and
making
islands
of
the
woods
on
the
steep
uncultivated
tracts
the
islands
rising
out
of
the
mists
of
time
are
the
hills
and
mountains
and
along
their
ridges
ran
the
first
roads
and
by
them
are
the
squares
and
circles
of
the
first
habitations
and
the
mounds
of
the
first
solemnized
graves
used
sometimes
it
is
thought
as
guides
for
travellers
hibbert
lectures
it
is
particularly
easy
to
think
of
southern
england
as
several
chains
of
islands
representing
the
downs
the
chilterns
and
gog
magogs
the
mendips
cotswolds
and
quantocks
i
have
more
than
once
caught
myself
thinking
of
the
broad
elephantine
back
of
butser
hill
heaving
up
spotted
with
gorse
but
treeless
between
petersfield
and
portsmouth
as
ararat
though
my
unfaithful
eyes
fail
to
imagine
the
ark
there
are
days
now
when
the
clear
suddenly
swelling
hills
like
tarberry
or
barrow
hill
in
hampshire
or
cley
hill
or
the
knolls
of
maiden
bradley
in
wiltshire
or
the
abrupt
promontories
like
chanctonbury
or
noar
hill
near
selborne
or
the
long
trooping
ranges
seem
to
be
islands
or
atolls
looming
dimly
through
the
snowy
still
mists
of
morning
or
the
clouds
of
rainstorm
even
without
mist
some
of
the
isolated
green
hills
rise
out
of
the
pale
levels
of
cornland
as
out
of
sea
and
i
have
seen
from
near
bruton
the
mass
of
cadbury
the
hill
some
call
camelot
in
somerset
look
like
a
dark
precipitous
isle
when
the
early
roads
along
the
ridges
were
made
the
hills
still
more
closely
resembled
islands
emerging
out
of
the
forest
and
out
of
the
marsh
the
watersheds
created
the
roads
as
they
still
do
over
hundreds
of
miles
in
africa
the
roads
keep
to
the
highland
and
if
this
highland
were
to
form
a
circle
they
would
follow
it
and
hunters
say
as
nevinson
tells
us
in
modern
that
the
elephants
do
move
in
a
kind
of
rough
zone
or
circle
from
the
upper
zambesi
across
the
cuando
into
angola
and
the
district
where
they
passed
me
and
so
across
the
cuanza
northward
and
eastward
into
the
congo
and
round
towards
katanga
and
the
sources
of
the
zambesi
somewhere
too
i
have
met
the
tradition
probably
a
welsh
one
that
this
island
of
britain
was
girdled
by
a
road
above
its
shores
the
early
nomads
would
descend
from
the
ridges
only
with
reluctance
for
fear
of
the
marsh
and
the
dim
forest
doubtless
their
travelling
oxen
especially
if
burdened
had
the
same
horror
of
mud
when
they
are
not
free
to
wallow
in
it
as
they
have
in
a
very
early
age
it
is
likely
that
men
would
go
down
to
the
rivers
only
to
water
their
cattle
and
then
return
to
the
heights
there
would
be
several
and
at
one
of
them
they
would
discover
a
ford
unless
the
animals
had
already
marked
one
and
then
if
the
river
had
not
become
a
boundary
they
might
cross
and
continue
their
wanderings
along
a
road
upon
the
next
island
of
hills
thus
island
would
be
joined
to
island
the
paths
ran
along
the
back
of
each
one
and
branched
over
the
spurs
and
the
linking
up
of
these
would
tend
to
form
highways
of
great
length
like
that
trodden
by
launcelot
far
o
er
the
long
backs
of
the
bushless
downs
to
camelot
it
were
easy
to
take
such
a
route
from
anywhere
in
berkshire
or
hampshire
travelling
high
and
away
from
cities
except
cities
of
the
dead
like
avebury
far
from
towns
and
villages
through
wiltshire
into
somerset
or
dorset
on
roads
which
are
altogether
turf
or
have
so
goodly
a
border
of
grass
and
blossom
that
the
wayfarer
need
never
touch
the
hard
white
grit
which
is
the
same
on
a
metalled
road
whether
in
london
or
in
wild
country
illustration
the
ridgeway
near
blowingstone
hill
berkshire
down
from
the
bridge
of
islands
above
the
world
the
traveller
descended
to
cities
of
men
thus
sir
launcelot
after
long
riding
in
a
great
forest
came
into
a
low
country
of
fair
rivers
and
meadows
and
saw
before
him
the
long
bridge
and
the
three
pavilions
on
it
of
silk
and
sendal
of
divers
thus
sir
bevis
of
hampton
cheated
of
his
patrimony
by
a
cruel
mother
and
keeping
sheep
on
the
downs
looked
and
saw
below
him
the
town
and
the
tower
that
should
have
been
his
thus
cobbett
looking
from
portsdown
hill
above
portsmouth
saw
the
sea
for
the
first
time
and
the
english
fleet
riding
at
anchor
at
spithead
and
his
heart
was
inflated
with
national
pride
and
though
he
had
walked
thirty
miles
that
day
he
slept
not
a
moment
but
rose
at
daylight
and
offered
himself
for
the
sea
on
board
the
thus
we
descend
on
winchester
or
salisbury
out
of
the
hills
glad
to
get
there
what
we
want
as
we
have
for
many
days
gladly
wanted
what
we
could
get
it
has
been
let
us
say
a
day
that
should
be
spring
and
in
the
dark
wet
copses
there
were
thousands
of
primroses
all
day
the
wind
and
often
rain
and
wind
together
roared
in
the
trees
the
pale
flowers
were
soaked
and
frayed
and
speckled
with
dust
from
the
trees
and
they
hung
down
or
were
broken
from
their
soft
stalks
but
the
high
land
and
the
neighbouring
sky
exalt
us
even
the
sight
of
these
petals
ruined
in
the
drenched
grass
was
pleasant
we
should
have
liked
better
to
see
them
unspoiled
and
wide
in
the
sun
but
we
did
not
wish
them
to
be
so
and
their
distress
did
but
add
to
the
glory
of
the
storm
and
to
our
defiance
just
as
did
the
cowering
of
birds
of
bowed
trees
of
whole
woods
under
the
wild
shadowy
swoop
of
the
mist
and
rain
and
the
valleys
below
us
humbled
their
broad
fields
their
upthrust
churches
and
clustered
villages
overwhelmed
and
blotted
out
and
everything
annihilated
save
the
wind
the
rain
the
streaming
road
and
the
vigorous
limbs
and
glowing
brain
and
what
they
created
not
that
we
did
not
welcome
freely
the
minutes
of
dimly
shining
stillness
that
were
as
a
secluded
garden
in
a
city
when
the
storm
paused
for
then
we
drank
in
the
blue
sky
and
the
dark
revealed
tracts
of
plain
and
hill
that
lay
stunned
and
astonished
like
a
dreamer
opening
his
eyelids
after
tumultuous
dreams
we
drank
them
with
easy
joy
as
of
a
man
reading
a
great
adventure
when
the
heroes
of
it
have
long
been
dead
for
we
ourselves
were
so
much
above
all
that
expanse
which
powerless
and
quiet
might
almost
seem
to
belong
to
the
past
or
to
a
tale
we
and
the
storm
were
one
and
we
were
triumphant
and
in
mid
triumph
we
came
down
to
the
lighted
streets
as
the
first
roads
were
made
by
men
following
herds
either
as
hunters
or
as
herdsmen
so
ox

sheep
have
long
helped
to
keep
them
up
the
great
road
of
pilgrimage
from
damascus
to
mecca
is
not
a
made
road
but
composed
of
the
parallel
strands
of
old
hollow
camel
paths
these
says
charles

in

ox
drove
is
the
name
in
several
places
of
an
old
green
road
travellers
in
wiltshire
have
noticed
on
the
ordnance
survey
map
a
british
trackway
running
out
of
the
road
from
the
deverills
to
maiden
bradley
a
large
tumulus
stands
in
the
first
field
as
if
for
a
sign
at
the
beginning
of
the
track
locally
this
is
known
as
the
ox
road
and
is
said
to
have
been
used
by
droves
coming
from
mid
and
east
somerset
it
is
a
continuation
of
the
hard
road
which
it
leaves
at
the
tumulus
and
following
it
and
its
continuations
you
may
travel
through
kilmington
and
between
the
jack
s
castle
tumulus
and
king
alfred
s
tower
down
kingsettle
hill
and
on
close
to
cadbury
castle
to

foss
way
reach
devon
and
cornwall
only
one
mile
of
its
course
is
marked
in
old
english
letters
british
trackway
and
this
is
apparently
not
even
a
path
but
a
protracted
unevenness
of
the
ground
sometimes
almost
amounting
to
a
ridge
or
terrace
in
the
grass
for
the
most
part
following
the
hedges
and
in
one
place
entering
a
short
nettly
lane
the
road
in
spite
of
its
romantic
old
english
lettering
is
at
this
point
a
very
humble
specimen
of
an
ancient
road
and
ox
drove
for
it
goes
through
meadows
which
are
low
compared
with
the
fine
waves
of

the

on

side
of
it
a
far
better
one
is
the
ox
drove
which
this
joins
at
kilmington
it
is
said
to
have
been
used
as
a
road
from
london
to
exeter
farmers
will
tell
you
that
the
ox
drove
never
touched
water
which
they
will
qualify
by
saying
you
could
go
from
monkton
deverill
to
marlborough
without
touching
water
or
crossing
it
and
if
that
also
is
impossible
at
any
rate
they
have
the
tradition
of
the
road

character
in
their
heads
seldom
as
they
may
use
it
along
it
says
powell
came
fat
cattle
from
the
somerset
pastures
to
london
and
once
he
thinks
it
was
a
road
leading
to
the
lead
of
somerset
and
tin
of
cornwall
arch√¶ological
xxxiv
it
goes
through
the
orchards
of
somerset
as
a
good
hard
road
but
often
deprived
of
its
right
green
borders
when
these
have
been
lost
they
have
not
always
disappeared
and
its
old
breadth
is
shown
probably
by
a
long
narrow
field
lying
first
on
one
side
and
then
after
a
zigzag
on
the
other
as
near
the

to
the

of

with
a
green

beside

a

behind

with
few
deviations

having
a
purpose
obviously
unconnected
with
the

on
its
edge
here
it
is
called
the
hardway
the
hard

is
the
countryman
s
admiring
term
for
a
made
road
but
it
is
suggested
that
the
hardway
is
the

and
is
a
continuation
of
a
road
running
east
and
west
through
hampshire
and
wiltshire
it
crosses
the
little
shaded
river
brue
and
ascends
kingsettle
hill
between
high
banks
of
beech
and

bluebell
it
mounts
like
a
savage
who
does
not
mind
being
out
of

straight
up
the
steep
wooded
wall
of
the
hill
until
at
the

it
is
eight
hundred

fifty
feet
high
instead
of
four
hundred

takes
you
into
wiltshire
on

is
the
huge
square
tower
of
brick
erected
by
one
of
the
colt
hoare
family
in
honour
of
king
alfred
the
name
kingsettle
hill
was
thought
by
colt
hoare
to
mark
the
pass
of
king
alfred
when
with
the
chief
men
of
somerset
he
issued
from
athelney
after
eastertide
in
and
marched
to
egbert
s
stone
in
the
east
part
of
selwood
forest
this
stone
or
cliff
has
been
supposed
to
be
white
sheet
hill
a
very
conspicuous
and
noble
place
for
the
king
to
gather
the
people
of
somerset
wiltshire
and
hampshire
before
leading
them
to
the
victory
of
edington
on
the
right
and
like
alfred
s
tower
at
the
brink
of
the
hill
is
the
big
tumulus
known
as
jack
s
castle
and
from
either
you
command
somersetshire
nearly
as
far
as
the
curvature
of
the
earth
allows
from
the
oaks
and
bluebells
of
the
slopes
beneath
you
stretches
a
low
subdivided
country
of
many
oaks
and
cuckoos
calling
from
them
and
the
hardway
penetrating
it
from
the
colt

calls
the

a

the

of
an

takes
you
through
the

now
it
has
a
fair
green
border
often
of
considerable
breadth
that
you
are
in

there
can
be
no
doubt
on
emerging
from
the

for
in

upon

are
those
gentle

the

above
maiden
bradley
smooth
detached
green

crested
and
fringed
with

under

of
the

is
the

of
kilmington
church
among
its
trees
lying
across
the
road
a
few
miles
ahead
are
the
bare
white

which
are
to
be
mounted
and
farther
to

the

a
little
to
the

of
a
lesser
isolated

a
smooth

is
gently
and
evenly
rising
a
hard
white
road
almost
straight
between
grassy
borders
with
thorns
and
brambles
under
beeches
that
overhang
from
behind
the
hedge
they
are
good
trees
standing
on
a
strip
of
turf
furrowed
as
if
it
had
once
been
the
road
or
part
of
it
and
some
young
ones
have
been
lately
planted
so
that
all
is
not
yet
over
with
english
country
though
landlords
say
so
the
road
crosses
another
to
kilmington
and
yarnfield
and
at
once
it
is
hard
but
winding
slightly
among
bushy
and
lush
steep
banks
you
see
flowers
and
ash
trees
and
a
linnet
on
the
tip
of
one
but
nothing
distant
save
white
clouds
and
the
blue
here
it
is
called
long

and
among
its
herbage
is
an
old
london
milestone
long
lane
is
often
the
title
of
a
lane
coming
from
somewhere
afar
off
there
is
one
south
of
hermitage
giving
its
name
to
a
village
in

one
near
cucklington
in

where
there
is
a

in
another

crosses
the

by
a
smithy

a

becomes
white

and
it
goes
straight
in

of
the
high
white
quarry
and
the
deep
tracks
up
to
white

castle
like
long

it
is
a
parish
boundary
both
are
without

the
road
has
hardly
passed
a
house
since
redlynch
save
at
a
crossing
and
those
living
in
the

use
the

only
for
a
mile

so
on

is

a

dappled
dusky

by

beautiful
long

and
the
vale
stretching
away
to
the
long
ridge
of
dorset
it
is
a
high
way
and
a
proud
way
after
crossing
an
ancient
ditch
it
is
labelled
british
trackway
and
ahead
it
is
seen
going
between
a
wire
fence
and
a
dark
line
of
tussocks
then
it
is
divided
into
three
or
four
parallel
terraces
grooved
by
wheels
but
with
a
lark
s
nest
in
the
green
rut
it
crosses
the
mere
road
as
two
hollow
ways
side
by
side
but
in
a
little
while
is
only
a
green
track
with
single
thorns
on
the
left
here
is
the
milestone
from
sarum
the
from
london
inscribed
and
it
is
called
the
london
drove
road
it
is
still
in
sight
of
alfred
s
tower
now
protruding
above
white
sheet
ramparts
in
one
place
it
is
so
wide
that
the
milestone
stands
out
in
the
middle
like
a
traveller
asleep
or
turned
to
stone
among
that
have
blotted
the
signs
of
other
travellers
on
the
left
as
far
as
the
main
wincanton
road
part
of
the
track
is
embanked
entering
the
hard
motor
road
to
amesbury
and
london
the
old
way
is
outlined
chiefly
by
the
thorns
of
old
willoughby
hedge
on
the
left
the
road
going
hedgeless
across
the
downland
is
but
the
thin
backbone
of
the
old
green
way
for
a
time
the
line
of
thorns
diverges
and
then
soon
after
the
crossing
of
the
warminster
road
they
come
slanting
from
the
right
to
meet
the
road
and
cross
it
just
before
another
milestone
hereby
are
three
milestones
on
different
roads
all
close
together
which
has
caused
the
easy
winning
of
merry
wagers
to
run
past
three
milestones
in
three
minutes
the
drove
crosses
several
roads
going
to
hindon
as
a
broad
green
track
with
or
without
a
hedge
marked
by
its
greater
profusion
of
daisies
and
its
paleness
and
lack
of
tussocks
still
there
are
pewits
and
somewhere
not
far
away
a
pewit
castle
it
is
joined
again
by
the
main
amesbury
road
beyond
cold
berwick
hill
but
presently
deserted
the
busier
white
way
going
boldly
off
over
the
ridge
and
down
to
the
wylye
river
and
up
again
on
to
salisbury
plain
by
yarnbury
and
so
past
stonehenge
to
amesbury
the
green
road
winds
along
the
south
slope
of
the
ridge
now
two
lines
of
thorns
show
the
course
far
ahead
or
the
white
weals
of
an
ascent
are
seen
now
gorse
encroaches
on
it
and
at
a
crossway
tins
and
grey
embers
mark
an
encampment
of
nomads
it
passes
thickets
of
thorn
and
wayfaring
trees
burying
an
old
milestone
to
sarum
turf
or
corn
lies
on
either
hand
or
on
both
it
keeps
along
the
edge
of
groveley
woods
and
within
sound
of
the
nightingales
until
it
bends
down
to
salisbury
once
probably
it
or
a
higher
parallel
course
went
over
a
ford
to
old
sarum
and
evidently
it
is
vastly
older
than
the
milestones
perhaps
old
enough
to
have
guided
the
hampshire
men
and
some
of
the
wiltshiremen
to
alfred
a
road
such
as
cobbett
loved
for
the
hammering
of
horses
hoofs
on
flints
another
fine
ox
drove
and
dignified
by
that
name
and
by
old
lettering
on
the
ordnance
map
ran
clear
for
a
long
stretch
along
the
high
land
south
of
the
ebble
river
from
a
point
four
miles
south
of
salisbury
and
westwards
by
winkelbury
to
the
south
of
shaftesbury
it
may
some
day
be
proved
that
one
of
the
most
famous
of
ancient
roads
the
icknield
way
itself
was
an
ox
drove
there
is
said
to
be
a
charter
mentioning
the
icknield
way
as
the
way
the
cattle
go
and
one
writer
has
boldly
derived
the
very
name
from
the
british
yken
or
ychen
meaning
oxen
every
district
in
the
chalk
country
has
its
tradition
of
an
old
road
now
surviving
in
a
footpath
or
in
broken
vertebr√¶
of
lane
and
footpath
to
provide
walkers
with
endless
theories
at
swindon
for
example
it
is
said
that
the
holy
well
stood
on
a
road
coming
from
the
east
and
going
westward
past
bradenstoke
abbey
into
somerset
and
on
another
used
by
pilgrims
to
the
shrine
of

this
is
not
the
place
to
give
way
to
the
fascination
of

fifty
years

except
that

the

much
from

time
until
the
day
of
railway
trucks
carrying
thickets
of
moaning
horns
and
square
blocks
of
sheep
the
turnpike

helped
to
preserve

to
have
been
called

there
is
a

in

by

of
banbury
and
the

and
said
to
have

the

of
welsh

there
is
a
welsh
lane
in
the
cotswolds
turning
out
of
the
gloucester
road
three
or
four
miles
from
cirencester
and
going
up
the
hill
by
four
mile
bottom
towards
barnsley
i
met
an
old
man
who
remembered
helping
the
welsh
drovers
with
their
black
cattle
there
sixty
years
ago
they
were
putting
up
near
by
for
the
night
and
they
liked
the

his

was

these

would
be
practicable
for
the
most
part
all
the
year
round
but
defoe
tells
us
that
the
clay
roads
of
the
midlands
used
to
be
so
bad
that
graziers
sold
their
stock
in
september
and
october
they
could
then
be
taken
to
the
neighbourhood
of
london
and
kept
until
to
be
sold
at
a
high

cheshire

by

to

thence
by

gloucester

sent
their

by

to

then
onward
by

their

could
travel

under

wiltshire
i
have
not
had
the
fortune
to
meet
drovers
from
wales
but
where
the
icknield
way
through
buckinghamshire
rounds
the
promontory
beacon
of
the
ivinghoe
hills
i
have
seen
men
with
sheep
from
berkshire
or
dorset
journeying
towards
dunstable
royston
and
the
farms
of
cambridgeshire
and
suffolk
they
have
to
go
much
on
the
hard
grit
and
i
have
heard
that
they
are
kept
off
the
unfenced
ridgeway
lest
the
flock
should
eat
too
much
of
the
pastures
in
their
passage
the
sheep
dislike
the
grit
as
much
as
burroughs
loves
it
and
i
hate
it
and
what
with
the
traffic
and
the
harshness
of
the
road
it
is
not
surprising
to
hear
of
a
welsh
flock
taking
a
week
to
get
from
warminster
to
monckton
deverill
where
the
high

are
fenced
there
could
be
no
better

the
track
is
twenty

thirty
yards
wide
or
more
it
is
untouched
by
wheels
and
grows
nothing
but
grass
and
the
most
delicate
flowers
along
similar
droves
doubtless
the
sheep
go
up
to
the
alpine
grass
in

as
the
shepherd
in

told

we
went
between
the

feeding
every

at

in

we
heard
the

ahead
and
slept
upon

myself
and
another
herdboy
we
tied
ourselves
together
not
to
wander
from
the
road
whenever
shepherds
from
the
rhone
are
met
about
camps
in
the
sierras
they
will
be
talking
of
how
they
slept
upon

the

time
to

after

of

to

with

this

it
is
one
of
the
adventurous
pleasures
of
a
good
map
thus
to
trace
the
possible
course
of
a
known
old
road
or
to
discover
one
that
was

of
footpath

and

road
lane
and
footpath
leading
across
the
country
and
corresponding
in
much
of
its
course
with
boundaries
is
likely
to
be
an
ancient
way
by
this
means
much
of
the
line
of
a
road
like
the
icknield
way
might
be
recovered
if
document
and
tradition
had
not
preserved
it
without
these
signs
few
men
could
tell
an
old
from
a
new
road
though
in
fact
there
are
not
many
great
lengths
of
entirely
new
road
except
in
new
towns
and
newly
drained
regions
elsewhere
the
new
roads
have
been
made
by
linking
up
or
improving
old
ones
the
life
of
cities
has
destroyed
at
once
the
necessity
and
the
power
to
judge
the
expanse
of
earth
under
our
eyes
and
few
but
soldiers
educate
whatever
gift
they
have
for
this
kind
of
judgment
if
we
learn
to
use
a
map
it
is
without
fundamental
understanding
without
the
savage
s
or
the
soldier
s
or
the
traveller
s
grasp
we
must
have
inherited
glimmerings
of
the
old
power
but
they
help
us
chiefly
to
an
√¶sthetic
appreciation
of
landscape
let
a
man
take
an
old
map
not
a
very
old
one
which
may
be
faulty
or
deficient
of
his
own
district
and
see
if
he
can
really
grasp
the
system
of
the
hills
and
rivers
and
the
bones
of
the
land
and
the
essential
roads
and
not
be
long
baffled
merely
by
the
absence
of
certain
new
roads
and
familiar
names
for
few
old
ones
will
have
entirely
disappeared
if
he
is
not
so
baffled
he
has
cause
for
pride
many
are
to
be
found
who
can
hardly
read
a
map
when
going
from
north
to
south
down
the
map
instead
of
up
it
with
the
east
on
the
left
and
the
west
on
the
right
and
the
north
behind
and
their
difficulty
is
increased
by
being
in
a
railway
train
such
men
may
be
very
good
walkers
and
very
good
men
though
they
be
walking
for
exercise
or
to
improve
body
or
soul
which
is
a
reason
that
has
lately
been
condemned
by
belloc
the
detestable
habit
of
walking
for
exercise
he
tells
us
warps
the
he
is
perhaps
assuming
that
the
man
always
keeps
this
one
object
in
view
and
is
always
looking
at
his
watch
or
feeling
his
pulse
but
even
a
man
walking
for
exercise
may
forget
his
object
and
unexpectedly
profit
he
may
surprise
happiness
by
the
wayside
or
beyond
the
third
stile
and
no
man
can
do
more
whether
he
have
the
best
and
the
most
bellocian
object
in
the
world
then
he
condemns
also
men
who
ride
along
the
road
and
into
an
inn
yard
and
feel
that
they
are
like
some
one
in
a
this
is
a
rather
serious
matter
authors
have
unintentionally
persuaded
simple
men
to
suffer
many
blisters
for
the
chance
of
drinking
ale
in
the
manner
of
borrow
and
meeting
adventures
in
the
hope
of
being
heartily
and
whitmanesquely
democratic
even
leslie
stephen
lamented
that
he
was
unworthy
of
borrovian
adventures
for
they
never
fell
to
him
a
writer
in
the
s
has
made
a
good
piece
of
prose
in
which
he
speaks
of
himself
reading
the
of
in
an
old
inn
at
llandovery
as
hazlitt
read
nouvelle
at
llangollen
on
his
birthday
a
great
many
must
be
walking
over
england
nowadays
for
the
primary
object
of
writing
books
it
has
not
been
decided
whether
this
is
a
worthy
object
john
burroughs
also
condemns
a
walk
taken
as
a
prescription
but
goes
so
far
as
to
regard
walking
itself
as
a
virtue
he
says
that
his
countrymen
have
fallen
from
that
state
of
grace
which
capacity
to
enjoy
a
walk
implies
that
they
pride
themselves
on
small
feet
though
a
little
foot
never
yet
supported
a
great
he
says
they
could
walk
away
from
all
their
ennui
their
worldly
cares
their
uncharitableness
their
pride
of
dress
for
these
devils
always
want
to
ride
while
the
simple
virtues
are
never
so
happy
as
on
he
concludes
by
singing
the
sweetness
of
gravel
and
good
sharp
he
must
be
singing
the
grit
of
or
he
never
walked
all
day
in
the
full
blaze
of

the
grit
between
newmarket
and
hitchin
leslie
stephen
thought
the
true
walker
one
to
whom
walking
is
in
itself
delightful
he
regarded
walking
as
a
panacea
for
authors
and
believed
that
it
could
have
cured
johnson
and
made
byron
like
scott

or
two

harold
munro
took
a
month
across
france
into
italy
for
a
part
of
the
time
putting
himself
out
of
reach
of
letters
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
could
do
it
there
are
plenty
of
adventures
in
modern
life
but
we
still
crave
for
the
conspicuous
ones
which
look
so
splendid
when
their
heroes
are
distant
or
in
the
grave
these
are
the
only
adventures
which
we
deign
to
recognize
as
such
and
walking
being
a
primitive
act
natural
to
man
as
belloc
says
we
feel
restored
to
a
pristine
majesty
or
arcadianism
at
least
when
we
undertake
it
perhaps
if
we
walk
long
enough
we
shall
discover
something
about
roads
there
could
be
few
better
objects
for
walking
unless
it
be
to
meet
a
mistress
or
to
fetch
a
doctor
we
walk
for
a
thousand
reasons
because
we
are
tired
of
sitting
because
we
can
not
rest
to
get
away
from
towns
or
to
get
into
them
or
because
we
can
not
afford
to
ride
and
for
permanent
use
the
last
is
perhaps
the
best
as
it
is
the
oldest

history

and
invention
few
in
the
multitude
of
us
who
now
handle
maps
are
without
some
vague
awe
at
the
old
english
lettering
of
the
names
of
ancient
things
such
as
merry
maidens
idlebush
barrow
crugian
ladies
or
the
plain
carn
long
barrow
or
dolmen
not
many
could
explain
altogether
why
these
are
impressive
we
remember
the
same
lettering
in
old
mysterious
books
and
in
scott
s
and
wordsworth
s
we
are
touched
in
our
sense
of
unmeasured
antiquity
we
acknowledge
the
honour
and
the
darkness
of
the
human
inheritance
most
impressive
of
all
because
they
recur
across
many
counties
are
the
names
of
roads
like
the
sarn
helen
of
wales
the
pilgrims
way
of
england
it
is
part
of
their
power
that
they
have
no
obvious
and
limited
significance
and
were
certainly
not
bestowed
by
king
or
minister
as
names
are
given
by
a
merchant
to
his
commodities
instead
of
london
road
we
see
watling
street
instead
of
north
road
there
is
foss
way
or
ermine
but
all
these
make
some
appeal
however
fantastical
to
the
intelligence
icknield
street
or
icknield
way
makes
no
such
appeal
it
is
the
name
of
two
apparently
distinct
roads
one
with
a
roman
look
running
north
and
south
through
worcestershire
and
warwickshire
the
other
winding
with
the
chalk
hills
through
suffolk
cambridgeshire
hertfordshire
bedfordshire
buckinghamshire
oxfordshire
berkshire
and
wiltshire
i
shall
confine
myself
as
far
as
possible
to
this
second
road
it
runs
from
east
anglia
and
along
the
chilterns
to
the
downs
and
wessex
but
the
name
is
mysterious
for
centuries
since
holinshed
it
was
supposed
to
be
connected
with
the
east
anglian
kingdom
of
the
iceni
only
fifty
years
ago
guest
confidently
translated
it
as
the
warpath
of
the
iceni
and
connected
it
with
the
names
of
places
along
its
course
such
as
icklingham
ickleton
and
ickleford
it
is
pointed
out
with
equal
confidence
that
according
to
philological
laws
iceni
would
have
produced
in
england
a
form
beginning
with
or
henry
bradley
can
not
believe
that
there
was
any
knowledge
of
the
iceni
in
berkshire
but
finds
it
a
natural
supposition
that
the
road
was
called
after
a
woman
named
icenhild
though
he
points
out
that
no
such
person
or
name
is
known
in
myth
or
history
it
is
a
pleasure
to
see
a
learned
man
of
the
twentieth
century
thus
playing
at
the
invention
of
a
twilight
deity
as
the
patroness
of
an
old
road
like
the
helen
or
elen
of
wales
two
hundred
years
ago
his
invention
would
have
been
wholly
serious
and
generations
of
equally
serious
and
less
inventive
antiquaries
would
have
followed
him
there
have
been
other
explanations
camden
at
the
same
time
as
holinshed
accepted
the
connection
with
the
iceni
but
what
the
origin
of
the
name
should
be
he
says
in
his
as
god
shall
help
me
i
dare
not
guess
unless
one
should
derive
it
from
the
figure
of
the
county
and
refer
to
its
lying
upon
the
ocean
in
form
of
a
for
the
britons
in
their
language
call
a
wedge
iken
john
aubrey
had
it
from
mr
meredith
lloyd
that
ychen
is
upper
as
to
say
the
upper
country
or
people
and
that
ychen
also
signifies
wise
in
linked
it
with
the
name
of
agricola
because
of
the
significant
core
of
ick
or
in
the
form
ryknield
rick
willis
in
said
that
the
road
took
its
name
from
the
itchen
believing
that
it
began
at
southampton
and
went
parallel
to
that
river
to
winchester
and
that
was
the
saxon
name
for
the
old
iken
street
the
poet
william
barnes
lover
of
ancient
britons
said
that
it
might
come
from
a
word
meaning
high
or
upper
either
because
it
was
an
upcast
way
or
because
it
was
the
upper
or
eastern
road
while
ryknield
seemed
to
him
to
come
from
a
word
meaning
a
trench
and
therefore
a
hollow
and
still
nobody
knows
or
believes
that
anybody
else
knows
the
name
therefore
throws
no
light
at
present
on
the
use
or
history
of
the
road
much
has
been
written
about
the
icknield
way
by
antiquaries
from
the
sixteenth
to
the
nineteenth
centuries
most
of
them
regarded
the
road
as
one
of
the
four
royal
roads
or
roman
roads
of
britain
on
the
authority
not
of
local
evidence
and
direct
examination
but
of
laws
and
histories
the
earliest
of
these
are
the
laws
of
edward
the
here
four
roads
are
mentioned
watlinge
strete
fosse
hikenilde
strete
and
erminge
strete
two
of
them
extending
across
the
breadth
of
the
land
and
two
throughout
the
length
and
travellers
on
them
were
protected
by
the
king
s
peace
but
liebermann
assigns
as
a
probable
date
to
these
laws
a
year
between
and
pollock
and
maitland
in
their
of
english
condemn
the
work
as
a
compilation
of
the
last
years
of
henry
i
having
something
of
the
nature
of
a
political
pamphlet
and
being
adorned
with
pious
legends
its
statements
when
not
supported
by
other
evidence
will
hardly
tell
us
more
than
that
sane
men
of
the
twelfth
century
would
have
liked
these
statements
to
be
the
french
version
of
the
laws
of
william
the
conqueror
is
almost
word
for
word
the
same
as
the
laws
of
the
confessor
in
the
matter
of
the
royal
roads
the
latin
version
omits
hykenild
strete
roger
de
hoveden
in
uses
almost
the
same
words
so
does
henry
of
huntingdon
in
except
that
he
describes
the
icknield
way
as
going
out
of
the
east
into
the
west
harold
peake
suggests
to
me
that
these
writers
may
all
have
had
as
their
inspiration
the
brilliant
geoffrey
of
monmouth
who
wrote
the
of
the
british
in
the
early
twelfth
century
he
tells
us
in
language
not
more
credible
than
that
of
the
dream
of
maxen
in
the
that
king
belinus
commanded
four
roads
to
be
made
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
island
especially
careful
was
he
king
belinus
to
proclaim
that
the
cities
and
the
highways
that
led
unto
the
city
should
have
the
same
peace
that
dunwallo
had
established
therein
but
dissension
arose
as
concerning
the
highways
for
that
none
knew
the
line
whereby
their
boundaries
were
determined
the
king
therefore
being
minded
to
leave
no
loophole
for
quibbles
in
the
law
called
together
all
the
workmen
of
the
whole
island
and
commanded
a
highway
to
be
builded
of
stone
and
mortar
that
should
cut
through
the
entire
length
of
the
island
from
the
cornish
sea
to
the
coast
of
caithness
and
should
run
in
a
straight
line
from
one
city
unto
another
the
whole
of
the
way
along
a
second
also
he
bade
be
made
across
the
width
of
the
kingdom
which
stretching
from
the
city
of
menevia
on
the
sea
of
demetia
as
far
as
hamo
s
port
should
show
clear
guidance
to
the
cities
along
the
line
two
others
also
he
made
to
be
laid
out
slantwise
athwart
the
island
so
as
to
afford
access
unto
the
other
cities
then
he
dedicated
them
with
all
honour
and
dignity
and
proclaimed
it
as
of
his
common
law
that
condign
punishment
should
be
inflicted
on
any
that
should
do
violence
to
other
thereon
but
if
any
would
fain
know
all
of
his
ordinances
as
concerning
them
let
him
read
the
molmutine
laws
that
gildas
the
historian
did
translate
out
of
the
british
into
latin
and
king
alfred
out
of
the
latin
into
the
english
this
great
road
is
like
ermine
street
the
slantwise
roads
might
be
watling
street
and
the
foss
way
and
that
across
the
width
from
menevia
to
hamo
s
port
the
icknield
way
as
geoffrey
makes
one
road
go
from
the
cornish
sea
to
caithness
so
henry
of
huntingdon
takes
his
fosse
way
from
totnes
to
caithness
henry
as
is
known
had
read
part
or
all
of
geoffrey
s
book
before
it
was
given
to
the
world
and
made
an
abstract
of
it
and
the
romancer
had
warned
him
to
be
silent
as
to
the
british
kings
because
he
had
not
that
book
in
the
british
tongue
brought
from
brittany
by
walter
archdeacon
of
oxford
and
translated
into
latin
by
geoffrey
himself
here
as
usual
it
can
safely
be
said
that
geoffrey
s
words
are
not
pure
invention
but
what
his
authority
in
writing
or
tradition
may
have
been
appears
to
be
undiscoverable
he
may
have
used
some
tradition
which
was
the
basis
also
of
the
account
of
the
empress
helen
s
in
the
dream
of
he
may
have
used
the
laws
of
dynwal
moel
mud
before
the
crown
of
london
and
the
supremacy
of
this
island
were
seized
by
the
saxons
who
measured
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
island
in
order
to
know
its
journeys
by
and
institutes
of
wales
vendotian
henry
of
huntingdon
may
well
have
been
a
meek
adapter
of
geoffrey
s
majestic
statements
and
some
local
knowledge
of
his
own
may
have
helped
him
to
put
names
upon
the
roads
of
belinus
to
this
second
road
from
david
s
menevia
to
hamo
s
port
or
southampton
he
gives
the
name
of
ichenild
or
ikenild
walter
map
in
nugis
speaks
of
canute
holding
london
and
the
land
beyond
hickenild
and
edmund
the
rest
the
says
that
edmund
had
wessex
and
canute
the
north
part
or
mercia
and
these
two
together
help
to
define
the
road
whether
henry
of
huntingdon
s
history
owed
anything
to
geoffrey
robert
of
gloucester
s
metrical
chronicle
certainly
did
for
he
refers
to
belinus
as
the
but
like
henry
he
calls
the
road
from
totnes
to
caithness
the
fosse
of
the
icknield
street
he
says
that
it
went
from
east
to
west
and
also
apparently
that
it
was
the
road
from
david
s
to
southampton
through
worcester
cirencester
and
winchester
a
writer
of
ralph
higden
mentions
belin
and
he
gives
two
theories
about
the
fosse
but
evidently
himself
knows
nothing
he
calls
the
road
from
david
s
to
southampton
watling
street
his
fourth
road
goes
from
south
to
north
from
david
s
by
worcester
and
birmingham
lichfield
and
derby
chesterfield
and
york
to
tynemouth
and
its
name
varies
in
different
manuscripts
from
rikenildstrete
to
hikenilstrete
guest
has
pointed
out
that
higden
was
following
geoffrey
in
the
this
road
goes
from
south
to
north
from
david
s
to
tynemouth
and
is
called
once
belinstrete
and
three
times
hykeneldstret
or
hikeneldstret
the
author
does
not
mention
ermine
street
but
two
belinstretes
the
other
going
from
david
s
to
southampton
it
is
likely
that
none
of
these
men
except
geoffrey
and
perhaps
henry
could
have
mapped
the
roads
the
one
map
of
the
period
showing
the
roads
is
such
as
they
might
have
been
expected
to
make
it
belongs
probably
to
the
thirteenth
century
and
was
reproduced
by
hearne
from
a
british
museum
manuscript
in
vol
v
of
his
edition
of
leland
s
it
shows
the
four
roads
by
means
of
lines
and
a
brief
description
his
fosse
going
in
the
approved
manner
from
totnes
to
caithness
the
ermine
street
due
north
and
south
the
watling
street
from
to
ykenild
street
goes
straight
across
from
west
to
east
the
artist
s
description
of
this
as
of
the
other
roads
is
almost
word
for
word
from
henry
of
huntingdon
but
there
are
these
differences
and
additions
the
western
extremity
of
the
icknield
way
is
not
called
david
s
but
salisbury
which
is
thus
placed
due
north
of
totnes
where
david
s
should
be
the
eastern
or
as
he
calls
it
the
southern
is
edmunds
at
the
point
of
intersection
with
watling
street
he
writes
dunstaple
which
is
accurate
thus
he
is
original
only
in
his
description
of
the
icknield
way
in
putting
meridies
by
edmunds
he
made
a
slip
due
to
his
drawing
the
map
with
its
north
end
on
the
right
side
it
is
impossible
to
decide
the
extent
of
his
mistake
in
marking
salisbury
at
the
west
end
of
the
road
he
may
have
believed
that
it
went
to
salisbury
but
have
been
afraid
to
deviate
from
the
received
opinion
that
it
was
an
road
or
he
may
simply
have
put
salisbury
in
mistake
for
david
s
giving
bury
edmunds
as
the
eastern
termination
suggests
local
knowledge
which
the
accurate
position
of
dunstable
confirms
he
may
have
been
a
man
of
the
eastern
counties
who
thought
that
salisbury
was
not
only
the
end
of
the
road
as
travellers
told
him
but
a
city
in
the
west
holinshed
in
his
mentions
geoffrey
as
the
authority
for
the
origin
of
the
four
great
roads
and
after
quoting
him
goes
on
to
describe
an
ikenild
or
rikenild
beginning
somewhere
in
the
south
and
going
through
worcester
birmingham
and
chesterfield
to
the
mouth
of
the
tyne
i
take
it
he
says
to
be
called
the
ikenild
because
it
passed
through
the
kingdome
of
the
icenes
for
albeit
that
leland
and
others
following
him
doo
seeme
to
place
the
icenes
in
norffolke
and
suffolke
yet
in
mine
opinion
that
can
not
well
be
doone
sith
it
is
manifest
by
tacitus
that
they
laie
neere
unto
the
silures
and
as
i
gesse
either
in
stafford
and
worcester
shires
or
in
both
except
my
conjecture
doo
fail
here
it
is
to
be
noticed
first
that
he
gives
ikenild
and
rikenild
as
alternative
names
of
one
road
and
second
that
he
sees
the
resemblance
between
ikenild
and
he
has
evidently
thought
about
the
matter
but
he
shows
no
trace
of
local
knowledge
or
curiosity
camden
also
only
mentions
the
road
in
his
introduction
to
the
subject
of
the
iceni
though
he
has
to
speak
of
many
places
touched
by
the
road
he
ignores
the
fact
if
he
ever
knew
it
the
poet
drayton
in
his
substitutes
michael
s
utmost
mount
for
totnes
at
the
south
end
of
the
fosse
way
and
takes
watling
street
from
dover
to
the
farth
st
of
fruitful
anglesey
and
he
writes
like
a
warwickshire
man
of
the
country
where
those
two
roads
cross
song
xiii
ii
song
xxvi
ii
in
the
sixteenth
song
of
he
makes
watling
sing
of
herself
and
her
three
sister
streets
since
us
his
kingly
ways
mulmutius
first
began
from
sea
again
to
sea
that
through
the
island
ran
which
that
in
mind
to
keep
posterity
might
have
appointing
first
our
course
this
privilege
he
gave
that
no
man
might
arrest
or
debtors
goods
might
seize
in
any
of
us
four
his
military
ways
having
sung
of
the
fosse
watling
continues
but
o
unhappy
chance
through
time
s
disastrous
lot
our
other
fellow
streets
lie
utterly
forgot
as
icning
that
set
out
from
yarmouth
in
the
east
by
the
iceni
then
being
generally
possest
was
of
that
people
first
term
d
icning
in
her
race
upon
the
chiltern
here
that
did
my
course
imbrace
into
the
dropping
south
and
bearing
then
outright
upon
the
solent
sea
stopt
on
the
rickneld
he
takes
from
david
s
to
tynemouth
it
is
very
clear
that
drayton
had
read
geoffrey
or
a
disciple
the
notes
to
reveal
the
fact
that
selden
accepted
molmutius
and
his
laws
take
it
upon
credit
of
the
british
story
are
his
words
he
accepted
also
king
belin
and
the
making
of
the
four
roads
but
having
noticed
that
authorities
vary
as
to
their
courses
and
even
their
names
he
is
content
to
say
to
endeavour
certainty
in
them
were
but
to
obtrude
unwarrantable
conjecture
and
abuse
time
and
evidently
he
knew
these
roads
as
a
whole
neither
from
personal
knowledge
nor
from
contemporary
report
but
only
from
books
had
he
known
anything
he
would
have
betrayed
it
for
he
digresses
to
tell
the
little
that
he
knows
of
stanstreet
in
drayton
apparently
knew
more
though
perhaps
all
his
knowledge
was
not
available
for
verse
he
is
the
first
to
distinguish
clearly
between
the
ricknield
and
the
icknield
street
he
takes
the
icknield
way
from
yarmouth
to
the
solent
the
definite
yarmouth
now
for
the
first
time
connected
with
the
road
the
use
of
the
variant
icning
the
connection
with
the
chilterns
the
crossing
of
watling
street
all
suggest
local
knowledge
here
more
than
ever
it
is
to
be
wished
that
drayton
had
either
written
his
book
in
prose
or
had
given
his
authorities
and
his
actual
notes
of
local
lore
he
was
a
great
lover
of
england
and
of
wales
and
could
have
written
one
of
the
finest
prose
books
of
the
seventeenth
century
had
he
put
down
what
he
knew
without
ramming
it
into
the
mould
of
rhyme
of
all
these
men
except
drayton
and
the
man
who
drew
the
map
none
betrays
personal
knowledge
of
the
road
they
are
all
writing
of
something
either
too
generally
known
to
need
explanation
or
of
something
which
they
know
only
from
other
writers
all
their
words
together
hardly
do
more
than
prove
that
there
was
or
had
formerly
been
a
road
known
as
ricknield
or
icknield
street
or
at
most
that
there
were
or
had
been
three
roads
bearing
those
names
one
from
david
s
east
and
then
north
to
tynemouth
a
second
running
across
the
east
of
england
from
norfolk
to
southampton
and
a
third
from
david
s
to
southampton
the
second
seems
to
owe
nothing
to
geoffrey
and
all
the
local
knowledge
such
as
it
is
is
so
far
connected
with
this
in
appeared
a
book
by
one
who
had
not
only
heard
of
the
four
royal
roads
but
had
met
with
what
he
believed
to
be
one
of
them
this
was
robert
plot
s
history
of
he
says
of
the
four
basilical
consular
or
pr√¶torian
ways
or
chemini
majores
i
have
met
with
but
one
that
passeth
through
this
county
the
discovery
whereof
yet
i
hope
may
prove
acceptable
because
not
described
before
or
its
footsteps
any
where
noted
by
sir
spelman
camden
or
any
other
author
that
i
have
read
or
could
hear
of
whereat
indeed
i
can
not
but
very
much
wonder
since
it
is
called
by
its
old
name
at
very
many
places
ikenildway
to
this
very
day
some
indeed
call
it
icknil
some
acknil
others
hackney
and
some
again
hackington
but
all
intend
the
very
same
way
that
stretches
it
self
in
this
county
from
to
coming
into
it
out
of
bucks
at
the
parish
of
chinner
and
going
out
again
over
the
thames
into
berks
at
the
parish
of
goreing
the
reason
i
suppose
why
this
way
was
not
raised
is
because
it
lies
along
under
the
chiltern
hills
on
a
firm
fast
ground
having
the
hills
themselves
as
a
sufficient
direction
which
is
all
worth
notice
of
it
but
that
it
passes
through
no
town
or
village
in
the
county
but
only
goreing
nor
does
it
as
i
hear
scarce
any
where
else
for
which
reason
tis
much
used
by
stealers
of
cattle
and
secondly
that
it
seems
by
its
pointing
to
come
from
norfolk
and
suffolk
formerly
the
kingdom
of
the
iceni
from
whom
most
agree
and
perhaps
rightly
enough
it
received
its
name
icenild
or
ikenild
and
to
tend
the
other
way
westward
perhaps
into
devonshire
and
cornwall
to
the
land
s
he
adds
with
some
triumph
that
holinshed
was
much
mistaken
but
he
suspends
his
judgment
because
he
has
read
in
dugdale
s
of
of
an
in
that
county
he
prints
a
map
showing
the
road
passing
all
on
its
right
hand
as
it
goes
south
the
villages
of
kempton
chinner
oakley
crowell
kingston
aston
rowant
lewkner
sherborne
watlington
the
britwells
ewelme
croamish
gifford
nuneham
warren
mungewell
the
three
stokes
and
then
south
of
goring
church
he
adds
that
under
stokenchurch
hills
about
lewkner
and
aston
rowant
there
are
two
icknield
ways
an
upper
and
a
lower
and
here
it
may
be
mentioned
that
hearne
s
diary
for
september
has
the
entry
i
went
thro
ewelm
a
of
a
mile
from
which
is
gouldsheath
and
about
furlongs
east
said
ewelm
passeth
the
plot
gives
a
substance
to
a
name
he
proves
the
existence
of
a
road
bearing
the
name
of
icknield
and
variations
of
it
and
having
a
course
along
the
chilterns
like
drayton
s
road
he
does
not
exaggerate
in
fact
he
thinks
it
a
poor
sort
of
road
when
compared
with
the
icknield
street
through
staffordshire
of
which
he
says
i
look
upon
this
of
staffordshire
as
the
most
remarkable
of
the
two
and
so
to
be
that
iknild
street
which
is
usually
reckoned
to
be
one
of
the
four
basilical
or
great
ways
of
england
and
not
that
of
oxfordshire
this
being
raised
all
along
and
paved
at
some
places
and
very
signal
almost
wherever
it
goes
whereas
that
of
oxfordshire
is
not
so
there
whatever
it
may
be
in
other
the
next
evidence
is
eighteen
years
later
and
comes
from
the
maps
by
robert
morden
illustrating
gibson
s
edition
of
camden
s
his
map
of
hertfordshire
suddenly
introduces
us
to
a
road
called
the
icknal
or
icnal
way
running
west
from
royston
perhaps
even
from
barley
three
miles
of
royston
through
baldock
then
more
and
more
over
the
lea
to
the
north
of
luton
through
dunstable
and
so
leaving
on
its
right
hand
toternhoe
edlesborough
ivinghoe
and
marsworth
going
out
of
the
map
with
wilston
on
its
right
in
the
map
of
buckinghamshire
this
road
is
continued
through
wendover
and
passes
princes
risborough
and
bledlow
in
the
map
of
oxfordshire
it
is
called
icknield
way
and
follows
a
line
like
that
in
plot
s
map
crossing
grime
s
dike
leaving
ipsden
and
woodcot
on
its
left
reaching
the
thames
on
the
south
of
goring
church
the
berkshire
map
does
not
show
any
road
of
this
or
similar
name
or
any
one
corresponding
to
it
nor
is
the
road
to
be
found
on
the
maps
of
essex
cambridgeshire
suffolk
or
norfolk
the
extension
of
it
through
buckinghamshire
and
hertfordshire
may
well
have
come
from
the
local
knowledge
of
morden
or
a
collaborator
there
must
have
been
abundant
information
of
the
kind
used
by
plot
which
escaped
antiquaries
who
were
thinking
about
a
royal
road
a
majestic
basilical
or
consular
way
running
from
david
s
to
southampton
or
farther
john
aubrey
died
the
man
to
tap
this
local
lore
had
nothing
to
say
of
any
such
road
in
his
own
county
of
wiltshire
but
he
left
some
rough
notes
he
connects
iceni
with
ikenild
and
remarks
on
the
authority
of
wren
that
there
were
three
itchings
on
ikenel
street
including
itching
stoke
in
hampshire
where
the
pilgrims
way
fords
the
itchen
he
says
also
that
a
sherwood
told
him
of
an
ikenil
way
from
north
yarmouth
to
plymouth
the
country
people
will
say
keep
along
the
ikenil
way
the
wallington
wallington
is
two
miles
of
baldock
and
south
of
the
icknield
way
and
through
it
ran
a
parallel
road
mentioned
in
vol
xxv
from
barley
by
therfield
strethall
sandon
and
wallington
to
clothall
but
the
term
wallington
hills
does
not
exclude
the
icnal
way
marked
in
morden
s
map
the
precise
yarmouth
may
also
have
been
accurate
and
i
should
be
inclined
to
believe
that
at
that
day
men
sometimes
went
between
plymouth
and
north
yarmouth
by
a
road
or
chain
of
roads
known
through
perhaps
a
very
large
part
of
its
course
by
some
such
name
as
ikenil
way
a
period
of
antiquarian
conjecture
and
invention
was
now
beginning
with
exploration
often
of
an
active
kind
but
usually
kept
sternly
in
obedience
to
speculation
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
volume
of
hearne
s
is
an
essay
supposed
to
be
by
roger
gale
he
has
no
doubt
about
four
great
roads
but
regards
the
story
of
molmutius
and
belinus
as
exploded
and
says
that
nobody
now
questions
but
that
the
romans
made
them
he
distinguishes
as
does
drayton
between
icknield
and
ricknield
and
complains
of
the
old
confusion
the
icknield
way
which
has
its
rise
and
name
from
the
people
called
iceni
he
finds
first
with
any
certainty
near
barley
in
herts
as
in
robert
morden
s
map
but
he
suggests
an
eastern
continuation
through
ickleton
and
so
by
gogmagog
hills
and
over
newmarket
heath
to
ikesworth
not
two
miles
south
from
edmundsbury
and
possibly
to
burgh
castle
near
yarmouth
returning
westward
he
describes
a
course
which
might
have
been
taken
from
morden
s
map
except
that
in
the
neighbourhood
of
luton
it
touches
streatley
instead
of
leagrave
and
goes
to
houghton
regis
as
well
as
to
dunstable
but
having
reached
buckinghamshire
he
can
not
find
it
anywhere
apparent
to
the
eye
except
between
princes
risborrow
and
kemble
in
the
street
where
it
is
still
call
d
icknell
these
are
words
which
suggest
that
the
eye
was
not
his
own
in
oxfordshire
he
leaves
the
road
to
plot
at
goring
and
streatley
he
does
not
know
what
to
do
because
his
guides
henry
of
huntingdon
and
drayton
and
others
disagree
he
conjectures
a
continuation
to
southampton
another
through
speen
to
salisbury
and
beyond
where
he
has
found
the
name
aggleton
road
locally
given
to
the
road
near
badbury
castle
the
roman
road
from
old
sarum
to
dorchester
he
thinks
aggleton
road
can
have
no
connection
with
ickleton
but
he
shows
no
other
reason
for
believing
that
his
roman
road
is
the
icknield
way
in
appeared
the
of
gale
s
friend
william
stukeley
here
he
describes
an
exploration
of
the
icknield
way
he
takes
it
through
ickleton
and
like
gale
through
streatley
near
luton
he
mentions
the
lovely
prospect
from
the
northern
sides
of
the
chilterns
and
a
few
more
east
of
ickleton
or
his
newly
discovered
roman
camp
at
great
chesterford
he
speaks
of
the
road
going
along
the
boundary
between
essex
and
cambridgeshire
towards
icleworth
in
he
thinks
the
road
roman
beyond
the
thames
he
has
no
uncertainty
like
gale
he
says
straight
out
that
at
speen
the
great
road
coming
from
the
thames
at
goring
crosses
the
kennet
river
also
that
he
found
it
a
little
north
of
bridport
going
to
dorchester
and
accompanied
it
with
no
small
if
he
had
any
reason
for
calling
any
part
of
this
road
the
great
icening
street
of
the
romans
it
has
never
been
discovered
nor
has
anything
else
confirmed
his
view
except
that
leland
saw
two
roman
milestones
between
streatley
and
aldworth
which
have
been
seen
since
but
never
described
except
in
rumour
william
stukeley
who
read
oriuna
for
fortuna
on
a
coin
and
so
invented
the
belief
that
one
oriuna
was
the
wife
of
carausius
was
soon
afterwards
unanswerably
questioned
and
plainly
contradicted
on
matters
of
fact
by
smart
lethieullier
and
richard
willis
he
is
chiefly
memorable
here
because
the
now
venerable
title
of
was
conferred
by
him
on
the
road
which
he
chose
to
believe
the
icknield
way
the
title
translated
back
into
icknield
street
is
still
generally
accepted
francis
wise
found
the
road
where
gale
had
lost
it
beyond
the
ford
at
streatley
in
his
book
on
antiquities
in
he
says
that
it
loses
its
name
at
streatley
but
is
visible
enough
to
blewbury
and
known
as
the
great
reading
road
from
blewbury
through
upton
and
harwell
this
road
is
called
the
portway
yet
he
thinks
that
it
may
be
the
icknield
way
notwithstanding
or
if
not
there
is
an
alternative
to
the
south
lost
in
the
ploughland
until
near
lockinge
it
becomes
a
raised
way
called
icleton
meer
while
after
wantage
it
is
the
ickleton
way
going
all
under
the
hills
between
them
and
childrey
sparsholt
uffington
so
under
leaving
woolston
and
compton
on
the
right
thence
to
ashbury
and
bishopstone
he
thought
that
it
was
making
rather
for
avebury
than
for
salisbury
this
road
is
marked
as
eccleton
street
in
roque
s
fine
map
of
berkshire
though
it
is
not

to
be
certain
of
the

that

richard
willis
in
an
essay
posthumously
published
in
viii
claims
to
be
the
discoverer
of
two
roman
roads
which
fortunately
crossed
one
another
near
his
house
at
andover
one
of
these
was
the
road
from
southampton
by
winchester
and
cirencester
to
gloucester
and
this
was
he
says
i
doubt
not
the
ikeneld
he
does
not
say
why
he
is
certain
but
his
authority
or
inspiration
was
probably
geoffrey
or
a
disciple
he
had
an
eye
for
old
roads
but
too
generally
honoured
them
with
the
name
of
roman
he
noticed
the
old
road
leaving
his
supposed
icknield
street
on
the
right
a
mile
south
of
ogbourne
george
and
going
to
the
inn
now
called
the
shepherd
s
rest
at
totterdown
which
is
on
the
roman
road
from
speen
to
cirencester
among
several
roads
connecting
this
roman
icknield
street
with
the
ermine
street
he
mentions
a
road
which
he
calls
a
causeway
from
royston
to
ogbourne
george
or
at
least
to
bishopston
and
wanborough
this
has
been
called
icknield
street
but
he
will
call
it
the
oxford
icknield
street
which
he
says
from
coinciding
with
his
real
icknield
street
at
wanborough
acquired
its
name
it
would
be
as
reasonable
to
say
that
london
took
its
name
from
the
london
county
council
or
that
julius
c√¶sar
took
his
from
julius
c√¶sar
scaliger
the
unquestionable
fact
known
to
him
from
morden
s
map
from
plot
and
from
wise
that
there
is
a
road
with
the
name
of
icknield
way
or
a
variant
of
it
between
royston
and
wanborough
he
regards
as
a
stumbling
block
because
it
stands
in
the
way
of
theorists
less
insolent
than
himself
lysons
brings
together
two
more
such
opposites
as
wise
and
willis
in
berkshire
a
letter
is
quoted
from
a
church
surveyor
of
wantage
describing
the
berkshire
road
where
wise
had
been
uncertain
in
its
eastern
half
church
writes
the
has
been
ploughed
up
across
wantage
east
field
till
it
enters
charlton
a
hamlet
of
wantage
it
then
passes
through
west
lockinge
it
is
lost
across
bastard
s
park
in
east
lockinge
but
appears
again
from
that
park
to
ginge
brook
in
ardington
parish
it
passes
by
white
s
barn
in
manor
and
is
afterwards
ploughed
up
for
some
way
but
appears
again
after
crossing
the
by
wiltshire
s
and
barns
in
east
hendred
parish
from
thence
through
the
parishes
of
harwell
west
hagbourne
and
the
hamlet
of
upton
to
the
village
of
blewbury
and
through
the
parishes
of
aston
tirrold
and
cholsey
to
moulsford
on
the
thames
and
thence
to
streatley
from
upton
to
streatley
it
forms
part
of
the
new
turnpike
road
from
wantage
to
from
upton
station
to
the
east
edge
of
lockinge
park
this
road
is
now
an
almost
continuous
series
of
known
at
least
in
the
neighbourhood
of
east
hendred
which
it
leaves
half
a
mile
to
the
north
as
ickleton
street
or
ickleton
meer
this
evidence
of
confirming
statements
made
a
hundred
and
two
hundred
years
ago
is
sufficient
to
identify
that
portion
of
the
road
as
ickleton
street
beyond
wantage
wise
s
description
can
be
applied
only
to
the
modern
road
from
wantage
to
bishopston
or
as
far
as
the
calley
arms
at
wanborough
east
of
upton
the
modern
road
to
streatley
the
old
reading
turnpike
has
a
rival
in
a
series
of
through
blewbury
and
the
astons
and
possibly
to
be
connected
with
the
papist
way
near
cholsey
illustration
ickleton
meer
hagbourne
hill
near
upton
berks
thus
there
is
traditional
authority
for
giving
the
name
of
ickleton
street
or
way
to
a
series
of
roads
in
berkshire
between
bishopston
and
streatley
and
the
name
of
icknield
or
icnal
way
to
a
road
leading
from
royston
to
goring
and
hence
a
probability
that
the
two
were
united
by
the
ford
between
streatley
and
goring
to
this
can
be
added
a
strong
impression
that
this
road
came
from
a
norfolk
port
and
went
westward
to
avebury
and
thence
or
by
another
route
into
devon
or
cornwall
but
not
one
writer
except
perhaps
aubrey
s
friend
proves
or
even
implies
a
contemporary
use
of
this
road
throughout
its
course
while
drayton
and
plot
suggest
that
it
had
fallen
into
decay
in
their
time
along
with
mr
church
surveyor
of
wantage
in
lysons
appeared
a
bishop
john
bennet
bishop
of
cloyne
from
until
his
death
without
any
argument
or
evidence
he
makes
the
following
pronouncement
heralded
by
the
editorial
opinion
that
his
researches
have
enabled
him
to
speak
with
certainty
on
the
subject
the
ikeneld
enters
berkshire
from
oxfordshire
at
streatley
where
it
seems
to
have
divided
one
branch
by
the
name
of
the
ridgeway
continued
on
the
edge
of
the
high
ground
by
cuckhamsley
and
into
wiltshire
pointing
as
mr
wise
observes
rather
to
avebury
or
the
devizes
than
salisbury
while
the
other
branch
went
from
streatley
perhaps
by
hampstead
and
hermitage
under
the
name
of
the
west
ridge
to
newbury
and
thence
it
may
be
to
old
at
first
he
seems
to
misunderstand
wise
and
to
suppose
that
his
ickleton
street
was
a
road
on
the
unpopulated
ridge
and
not
in
the
valley
past
a
string
of
villages
and
he
goes
on
afterwards
to
assert
that
this
valley
road
is
roman
and
seems
to
come
from
a
spot
near
or
rather
below
wallingford
in
the
rev
henry
beeke
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
icknield
way
crossed
the
thames
at
moulsford
as
bennet
gives
no
reason
he
makes
no
apology
his
reason
for
giving
the
name
of
west
ridge
to
a
road
running
of
its
fellow
must
have
been
that
it
went
through
the
village
of
westridge
where
doubtless
the
road
was
called
the
westridge
way
as
the
road
from
chevington
is
called
the
chevington
way
and
so
on
he
had
apparently
no
reason
for
choosing
the
ridgeway
except
that
it
came
from
the
same
ford
at
streatley
reached
by
the
icknield
way
at
goring
nevertheless
he
has
been
so
persistently
followed
that
the
ridgeway
is
now
given
by
the
ordnance
survey
the
alternative
title
of
icknield
way
and
also
of
roman
road
which
even
the
bishop
said
it
was
not
some
berkshire
people
even
call
the
ridgeway
the
icknield
way
because
it
is
the
government
name
and
west
ridge
way
is
attached
with
all
the
honour
of
old
english
lettering
to
the
more
easterly
road
bennet
equals
stukeley
in
the
grandeur
of
his
fiction
and
the
veneration
which
it
has
earned
in
lysons
he
takes
the
road
through
newmarket
herein
coinciding
with
facts
but
continues
it
to
ickleton
on
the
east
of
the
modern
turnpike
along
a
course
never
yet
identified
men
who
were
not
bishops
now
begin
to
exercise
themselves
in
suggesting
roads
which
may
have
been
continuations
of
this
ickleton
or
icknield
way
they
print
their
opinions
with
varying
degrees
of
certainty
in
mason
rector
of
orford
in
suffolk
xxiii
traces
it
after
it
leaves
ixworth
to
buckenham
and
thence
by
two
forks
to
caistor
and
to
burgh
castle
samuel
woodward
in
xxiii
also
assumes
that
it
passes
through
buckenham
ixworth
and
bury
edmunds
in
alfred
john
kempe
xxvi
takes
it
for
granted
that
the
road
crossed
the
kingdom
from
norwich
towards
old
with
an
i
need
hardly
observe
he
connects
the
road
with
the
iceni
and
explains
it
as
the
that
is
the
old
street
or
way
of
the
arthur
taylor
institute
norwich
volume
connects
the
road
with
norwich
castle
hill
which
he
believes
to
be
british
like
the
ordnance
survey
map
he
takes
it
through
newmarket
kentford
cavenham
lackford
and
thetford
like
bennet
both
woodward
and
taylor
regard
the
road
as
a
british
trackway
but
taylor
earns
his
chief
distinction
by
the
possession
of
a
deed
apparently
of
the
reign
of
henry
iii
relating
to
premises
at
newmarket
and
extending
upon
in
in
the
form
of
a
discourse
afterwards
embodied
in
his
edwin
guest
wrote
a
long
account
of
the
icknield
way
he
mentions
as
evidence
charters
of
the
tenth
century
referring
to
estates
in
berkshire
between
blewbury
and
wayland
s
smithy
so
minute
he
says
as
almost
to
be
sufficient
foundation
for
a
map
but
not
to
enable
him
to
trace
the
road
for
he
accepts
bennet
s
substitution
of
the
ridgeway
north
of
the
thames
his
earliest
evidence
is
a
parchment
possibly
of
the
fourteenth
century
relating
to
the
foundation
of
dunstable
priory
at
a
place
where
the
two
royal
roads
of
watling
and
ickneld
cross
a
place
of
woods
and
robbers
near
houghton
he
quotes
a
letter
testimonial
of
proving
that
this
trackway
west
of
dunstable
was
known
as
ikeneld
strete
he
takes
the
road
from
icklingham
and
through
ickleton
and
ickleford
because
that
is
a
possible
course
and
because
he
believes
those
names
to
be
connected
with
iceni
and
what
was
the
one
great
road
described
as
icknield
street
in
the
of
the
he
finds
it
hard
to
define
but
he
can
find
no
traces
of
roman
construction
in
the
road
inspired
by
the
map
showing
salisbury
at
the
end
of
the
road
he
suggests
that
most
probably
it
joined
the
ridgeway
east
of
avebury
and
continued
along
its
course
as
recently
described
by
sir
richard
colt
hoare
woodward
and
wilks
in
their
history
of
hampshire
are
well
acquainted
with
the
many
theories
of
the
road
and
on
the
whole
see
most
reason
for
agreeing
with
drayton
but
also
for
giving
the
name
to
the
roman
road
from
winchester
to
cirencester
and
gloucester
or
another
roman
road
running
of
basingstoke
they
speak
of
the
allegation
that
in
ancient
deeds
the
road
to
gloucester
is
designated
as
hicknel
or
hicknal
way
but
these
have
not
been
identified
babington
in
his
speaks
of
the
road
as
easily
traced
from
thetford
to
kentford
and
he
regards
woodward
s
british
way
from
norwich
by
wymondham
and
attleborough
to
thetford
as
a
continuation
but
he
has
no
documentary
evidence
no
tradition
and
no
local
name
to
support
his
conjectures
at
any
point
between
norwich
and
royston
except
at
newmarket
he
could
not
find
bennet
s
road
from
newmarket
east
of
the
turnpike
probably
the
bishop
meant
the
roads
west
of
westley
waterless
past
linnet
hall
west
of
weston
colville
west
wratting
and
balsham
it
is
improbable
that
he
did
more
than
fly
over
them
in
fancy
he
is
satisfied
that
where
the
parish
and
afterwards
the
county
boundaries
coincide
with
the
present
road
from
newmarket
it
is
the
icknield
way
especially
as
at
stump
cross
the
county
boundary
follows
the
sudden
turn
out
of
the
main
road
along
a
lane
leading
over
the
cam
to
ickleton
from
ickleton
to
a
point
near
chrishall
grange
and
a
tumulus
where
for
a
mile
the
lane
is
a
county
boundary
it
is
uncertain
but
from
that
point
to
noon
s
folly
he
is
content
with
the
nearly
disused
track
which
near
there
again
becomes
a
county
boundary
thus
he
connects
newmarket
and
royston
by
a
road
of
the
same
character
as
the
parts
of
the
icknield
way
without
any
evidence
but
probability
the
rev
yorke
of
the
cambridge
antiquarian
prefers
the
road
known
as
ashwell
street
which
runs
for
some
miles
nearly
parallel
with
the
supposed
icknield
way
and
is
most
clear
from
ashwell
north
of
baldock
to
melbourn
of
royston
in
a
lucid
and
vigorous
article
he
says
that
there
can
be
no

also
proposes
another

from

almost
to

which
he
avoids
crossing
the

on
to

with
its
many

because
he
thinks
an

would
have
done

he
leaves

hastening
to

of

he
has
found
a
hickling

called

he
has
also

him
to
extend

at
about
the

time
as

sternly
avoids

reason
at
the
same
time
he
admits
the
probability
of
branches
to
those
places
when
they
became
important
thus
he
shows
that
he
has
in
his
mind
one
road
with
one
name
and
that
something
like
icknield
street
going
from
sea
to

not
only
in
the

before

the

to

the

of

which
can
safely
be

with

and
without

professor
haverfield
in
a
chapter
on
norfolk
in
the
county
of
that
county
he
pronounces
that
the
icknield
way
is
not
a
roman
road
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
iceni
or
norfolk
or
suffolk
that
the
name
icknield
and
the
names
like
ickleton
and
kenninghall
of
places
on
the
road
or
supposed
parts
of
it
can
not
for
philological
reasons
be
connected
with
the
iceni
at
present
he
is
unanswerable
though
his
mind
is
of
a
type
which
commands
more
interest
when
it
affirms
than
when
it
denies
illustration
icknield
way
near
ipsden
oxfordshire
since
the
time
of
wise
little
has
been
done
except
to
add
proofs
of
the
antiquity
of
the
road
under
the
chilterns
and
the
berkshire
downs
in
his
day
it
was
known
from
royston
to
bishopston
taylor
showed
that
it
touched
newmarket
but
no
more
tingey
shows
that
it
went
through
stoke
holy
cross
in
norfolk
but
little
or
nothing
has
been
done
to
fill
the
gap
between
his
fragment
of
hickling
lane
and
newmarket
even
the
road
between
newmarket
and
royston
depends
for
its
title
only
on
its
respectability
as
a
county
and
parish
boundary
reaching
the
thames
there
is
no
certainty
of
the
principal
ford
but
streatley
must
have
been
one
and
from
there
to
bishopston
the
main
line
of
the
road
is
clear
enough
a
man
may
follow
the
whole
of
this
road
in
a
few
days
and
be
upon
a
beaten
track
if
not
a
hard
road
everywhere
except
for
a
few
hundred
yards
near
ipsden
and
two
or
three
miles
from
the
east
side
of
lockinge
park
the
two
lengths
north
and
south
of
the
thames
make
a
road
of
uniform
character
keeping
almost
entirely
to
the
chalk
but
below
the
steepest
wall
of
the
hills
from
dunstable
westward
this
wall
on
the
left
or
south
of
the
road
is
an
unmistakable
guide
to
the
traveller
as
far
as
swyncombe
he
has
only
to
cling
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
he
is
on
the
icknield
way
beyond
the
thames
the
downs
make
a
guiding
wall
equally
clear
and
continuous
it
belongs
to
what
harold
peake
in
his
prehistoric
roads
of
leicestershire
of
old
calls
the
type
of
road
which
winds
along
the
sides
of
hills
just
above
the
alluvium
marshes
and
ground
are
avoided
but
small
streams
do
not
offer
so
great
an
obstacle
as
in
the
case
of
the
he
compares
it
with
the
pilgrims
way
from
winchester
to
canterbury
which
it
closely
resembles
except
that
it
keeps
always
on
the
northern
slopes
instead
of
the
southern
and
commands
throughout
its
course
views
of
a
wide
fertile
valley
northward
until
the
enclosures
and
the
metalling
of
roads
the
ruts
and
of
the
icknield
way
were
probably
spread
over
a
width
of
from
a
hundred
yards
to
a
mile
according
to
convenience
or
necessity
from
century
to
century
its
course
might
vary
even
more
thus
the
modern
road
between
kentford
and
newmarket
is
at
several
points
some
distance
from
the
cambridge
and
suffolk
boundary
which
is
supposed
to
follow
the
icknield
way
a
deed
already
mentioned
proves
that
the
road
was
known
in
newmarket
itself
beyond
newmarket
the
modern
road
is
marked
as
the
icknield
way
but
is
only
a
parish
boundary
or
rather
close
to
one
for
one
mile
in
the
first
eight
and
is
not
authenticated
by
any
known
documents
nor
is
any
parallel
road
in
the
same
direction
a
boundary
line
that
it
is
on
an
old
line
of
road
is
certain
from
the
number
of
tumuli
which
formerly
dotted
the
surrounding
heath
it
goes
through
three
dykes
two
eight
and
thirteen
miles
from
newmarket
and
it
has
been
conjectured
both
that
the
dykes
defend
the
road
and
that
the
road
was
made
by
an
invader
to
pierce
the
dykes
one
antiquary
asserts
that
the
fosse
of
the
brent
ditch
has
evidently
been
filled
up
to
admit
the
from
a
little
beyond
the
eighth

the

is
a
parish
boundary
with
very
short
interruptions

eleventh

the
fourteenth

it
becomes
the

for
some
distance
by

for
two
miles
before
entering
royston
by
this
sharp
turning
to
the
west
it
avoids
a
roman
camp
at

chesterford
and
passes
what
camden
called
the
ancient
little

of
ickleton
where
in
his
time
traces
of
the
burrough
banks
could
plainly
be

continues
as
such
in
a
clear
line
through
arable
land
and
alongside

until
it
joins
the

here
it
goes
over

the

is
authenticated
by

but
routes
to
the

fords
are
at

conjectural
streatley
meant
the
longest
way
round
for
travellers
going
west
through
berkshire
but
it
offered
the
driest
approaches
on
both
hands
and
the
narrowest
possible
strip
of
wet
land
at
the
crossing
in
summer
at
least
wallingford
would
attract
westward
travellers
and
there
is
a
reference
in
the
to
ikeneldstrete
as
running
from
wallingford
to
ashbury
men
using
this
ford
would
have
turned
out
of
the
streatley
track
at
gypsies
corner
and
here
or
a
mile
or
two
beyond
near
ipsden
they
could
branch
to
moulsford
and
the
stokes
beyond
streatley
there
is
at
first
only
one
road
westward
on
the
dry
and
rising
land
this
is
the
main
road
between

to
wallingford
church
of
wantage
pronounced
this
road
to
be
the
ickleton
way
as
far
as
upton
and
his
word
may
be
taken
to
prove
at
least
that
this
was
the
local
name
for
anyone
crossing
at
streatley
and
going
west
under
the
hills
instead
of
along
the
ridge
there
is
no
other

even
from

wallingford
men
would
be
forced
by

on

from

concludes
that
the
icknield
way
crossed
the
parish
very
near
the
modern
road
which
on
the
ordnance
map
bears
this
name
though
i
fancy
it
ran
originally
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
it
is
clear
then
that
the
icknield
way
ran
as
far
as
wanborough
between
the
highest
and
lowest
ground
along
a
course
similar
to
that
of
wise
s
ickleton
street
the
road
mentioned
must
either
be
wise
s
road
or
another
of
similar
course
which
has
been
superseded
by
it
in
name
and
use
and
can
hardly
be
other
than
that
now
called
on
the
ordnance
map
the
port
way
thus
the
road
from
newmarket
or
at
least
from
royston
by
streatley
to
wanborough
parish
is
a
venerable
and
continuous
one
which
bore
almost
the
same
name
at
its
extremities
ykenildeweie
at
newmarket
in
the
time
of
henry
iii
icenhilde
weg
at
wanborough
in
that
it
is
icknield
street
one
of
the
four
royal
roads
is
proved
only
by
its
coming
out
of
the
east
and
going
westward
and
by
its
crossing
watling
street
at
dunstable
as
does
the
ykenildstrete
of
the
map
unlike
the
other
three
roads
the
icknield
way
appears
not
to
have
been
romanized
at
any
point
and
assuming
that
it
had
in
the
middle
ages
the
importance
suggested
by
its
rank
with
these
roads
its
primitive
character
would
explain
its
decay
nothing
rescued
it
as
pilgrimages
rescued
that
part
of
an
ancient
road
now
known
as
the
pilgrims
way
from
winchester
to
canterbury
old
by
hilaire
belloc
its
western
object
had
apparently
been
so
deeply
lost
in
drayton
s
time
that
the
poet
took
it
to
southampton
though
whether
this
line
is
to
be
traced
to
geoffrey
of
monmouth
s
bold
definition
or
to
contemporary
usage
can
not
easily
be
decided
that
this
road
through
newmarket
and
streatley
is
the
one
in
drayton
s
mind
is
certain
of
the
other
roads
called
icknield
street
most
if
not
all
of
them
difficult
where
not
impossible
to
connect
with
this
road
as
continuations
or
as
branches
one
is
particularly
interesting
here
macray
s
ms
catalogue
of
magdalen
college
deeds
contains
several
mentions
of
ikenildwey
or
hykenyldewey
in
descriptions
of
boundaries
at
enham
near
andover
in
hampshire
one
belonging
to
refers
to
land
in
the
east
field
of
enham
on
the
north
of
the
highway
called
ikenildwey
another
of
to
two
acres
of
land
in
enham
regis
in
a
field
called
bakeleresbury
of
the
which
one
acre
lies
between
the
land
of
gilbert
slyk
on
either
side
extending
south
to
ikenildwe
one
of
to
arable
land
in
the
fields
of
andover
of
which
half
an
acre
extends
above
hykenyldewey
to
the
east
between
other
estates
in
the
north
and
south
while
another
acre
in
the
same
field
extends
above
laddrewey
to
the
i
conclude
from
these
descriptions
that
the
hykenyldewey
here
ran
east
and
west
and
it
is
not
a
region
of
winding
roads
batchelor
s
barn
and
walworth
cottages
about
a
mile
east
of
andover
seem
to
contain
memories
of
la
werthe
la
walwert
and
both
the
barn
and
the
cottages
lie
close
to
the
south
side
of
the
harrow
way
which
here
goes
east
and
west
on
its
way
from
farnham
to
weyhill
walworth
cottages
are
on
the
east
of
the
intersection
of
the
harrow
way
and
the
roman
road
from
winchester
to
wanborough
nythe
and
not
a
mile
south
of
the
intersection
of
this
roman
road
with
the
port
way
from
old
sarum
to
silchester
between
the
harrow
way
and
the
port
way
and
in
this
part
of
its
course
almost
parallel
with
them
is
a
road
from
stoke
and
newbury
one
of
these
roads
is
perhaps
the
road
referred
to
in
the
deeds
as
the
harrow
way
which
still
bears
its
name
in
the
neighbourhood
is
not
likely
to
have
been
the
road
the
port
way
appears
to
be
purely
roman
if
the
road
from
stoke
were
the
icknield
way
it
might
have
connected
streatley
with
winchester
and
southampton
yet
if
it
went
to
winchester
and
southampton
it
can
hardly
have
been
the
road
which
is
several
times
called
ikenilde
street
in
records
of
the
perambulations
of
the
hampshire
forests
the
survey
of
buckholt
forest
under
edward
i
for
example
contains
the
passage
begin
at
the
deneway
and
so
always
by
the
divisions
of
the
counties
of
southampton
and
wilts
to
th
ikenilde
street
and
thence
by
the
same
to
la
pulle
and
from
to
th
ikenilde
and
so
by
the
same
road
to
this
road
i
can
not
identify
but
a
road
touching
both
enham
and
buckholt
forest
would
probably
reach
old
sarum
there
is
an
icknield
street
marked
as
such
on
the
ordnance
map
going
north
from
weston
to
bidford
and
after
a
gap
from
stadley
north
towards
birmingham
it
goes
for
some
miles
parallel
to
a
much
higher
ridgeway
it
leaves
the
fosse
way
four
miles
south
of
near
and
is
the
road
described
by
codrington
as
ricknild
street
but
codrington
refers
to
a
part
of
it
where
the
railway
crosses
it
at
honeybourne
station
as
called
ricknild
or
icknield
street
and
to
the
lane
north
of
bidford
going
towards
alcester
as
icknield
street
this
road
or
a
longer
one
in
part
coinciding
with
it
was
first
called
icknield
street
by
ralph
higden
in
the
fourteenth
century
it
was
one
of
his
four
royal
roads
and
went
from
david
s
to
worcester
birmingham
and
derby
some
of
the
manuscripts
of
his
work
called
the
road
ryckneld
which
spelling
may
or
may
not
have
been
due
to
the
local
knowledge
of
a
scribe
both
english
translators
or
their
scribes
retain
the
r
calling
the
road
rykenildes
strete
or
rikenilde
street
duignan
on
staffordshire
place
quotes
references
to
this
road
in
the
twelfth
century
between
lichfield
and
derby
as
ikenhilde
ykenild
and
ricnelde
in
the
thirteenth
century
as
rikelinge
and
ykenilde
in
the
fourteenth
century
as
rykeneld
strete
he
also
gives
instances
which
seem
to
prove
that
there
were
unconnected
roads
known
as
ricknield
street
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
mentions
a
place
now
called
thorpe
salvin
lying
on
no
known
ricknield
street
but
once
known
as
selden
found
a
deed
mentioning
ricknield
street
as
a
boundary
near
birmingham
and
dugdale
one
of
relating
to
hilton
abbey
the
of
when
it
does
not
call
higden
s
road
belinstrete
calls
it
hykeneldstret
though
when
gale
quotes
it
he
makes
it
rykeneldstrete
stukeley
calls
it
the
ricning
way
and
complains
of
plot
for
calling
it
icknil
way
yet
he
himself
heard
it
called
the
hickling
street
near
the
crossing
of
watling
street
holinshed
calls
it
ikenild
or
in
the
time
of
the
second
and
third
edwards
there
were
men
named
after
ikenilde
or
hikenilde
strete
pat
rolls
in
worcestershire
one
of
them
was
a
man
of
alvechurch
which
lies
west
of
the
road
between
stadley
and
birmingham
and
there
was
an
ikeneld
street
in
the
sixteenth
century
within
the
lordship
of
allechurche
in
worcestershire
drayton
first
distinguished
between
an
eastern
icknield
street
and
a
western
ricknield
street
he
evidently
knew
the
icknield
way
along
the
chilterns
and
his
words
about
rikneld
street
as
coming
from
cambria
s
farther
shore
until
the
road
on
his
midway
did
me
in
england
meet
suggest
that
he
knew
the
road
as
a
warwickshire
man
and
that
his
distinction
was
not
wantonness
or
the
precision
of
ignorance
gale
accuses
the
road
of
taking
the
name
of
ickle
or
icknild
street
without
any
just
title
guest
also
believes
that
the
western
road
gradually
attached
to
itself
the
name
of
icknield
street
as
a
famous
name
to
which
it
had
no
right
wise
in
search
of
something
to
help
him
suggests
hickling
as
the
origin
of
the
name
but
knowing
of
ryknield
he
is
tempted
also
by
rickley
in
essex
confesses
the
temptation
and
must
now
beg
leave
to
call
the
road
the
great
ickle
or
rickle
this
use
of
rickling
reminds
me
of
a
woman
living
in
a
cottage
beside
the
ridgeway
near
chiseldon
i
asked
her
the
name
of
the
road
and
she
said
with
some
hesitation
the
i
asked
why
it
was
so
called
and
she
said
she
did
not
know
i
asked
where
it
went
and
she
answered
oh
over
there
pointing
west
to
rudge
i
suppose
rudge
being
near
westbury
an
antiquary
in
the
s
comfortably
explains
the
variation
as
due
to
the
british
particle
yr
prefixed
but
no
one
has
found
a
ricknield
or
a
rickling
or
any
such
name
along
the
course
of
the
road
from
newmarket
to
wanborough
it
seems
likely
that
icknield
like
watling
and
ermine
was
a
generic
name
for
a
road
whether
due
to
its
use
by
cattle
to
professor
bradley
s
lady
icenhild
or
to
something
else
one
such
road
in
worcestershire
and
the
west
and
another
in
the
east
tending
westward
were
possibly
at
one
time
well
known
as
continuous
routes
over
long
stretches
of
country
the
two
could
be
connected
ermine
street
passed
through
wanborough
nythe
at
the
west
end
of
the
icknield
way
from
east
anglia
went
to
cirencester
and
thence
both
to
where
it
touched
the
ricknield
street
and
the
fosse
way
and
to
gloucester
and
so
to
worcester
or
to
kentchester
and
the
of
wales
another
ancient
road
from
near
tring
the
akeman
street
would
take
travellers
on
the
icknield
way
due
west
to
cirencester
where
they
could
branch
as
they
pleased
to
gloucester
and
wales
or
the
north
thus
at
both
ends
of
ermine
street
and
akeman
street
or
their
continuations
there
were
roads
known
as
icknield
street
it
is
even
possible
that
the
whole
system
was
officially
given
the
one
name
of
icknield
street
and
such
a
system
might
fitly
be
called
a
royal
road
an
eastern
extension
of
the
road
to
a
dep√¥t
and
several
ports
in
norfolk
is
practically
certain
though
it
has
not
yet
been
discovered
or
satisfactorily
reconstructed
a
or
western
extension
beyond
wanborough
is
almost
equally
certain
there
is
no
need
to
look
for
a
road
that
is
all
of
one
type
without
antiquarianism
or
modern
regularity
only
common
and
continued
travel
throughout
its
course
can
preserve
a
road
even
during
this
extended
use
of
it
variants
will
be
discovered
from
time
to
time
and
used
as
alternatives
or
substitutes
as
soon
as
this
use
ceases
portions
of
the
road
begin
to
decay
and
soon
those
few
having
the
old
need
for
it
will
have
found
another
way
each
kind
of
civilization
doubtless
has
its
own
special
kind
of
road
and
gradually
old
roads
are
so
transformed
or
combined
as
to
form
such
a
road
but
invaders
or
newly
organized
people
have
to
take
what
roads
they
find
unless
they
have
roman
will
forethought
and
resource
to
make
their
own
though
by
good
fortune
men
suddenly
needing
a
road
may
find
an
old
one
ready
as
did
the
pilgrims
from
the
south
and
west
to
canterbury
who
used
the
pilgrims
way
men
wishing
to
travel
from
east
to
west
especially
in
the
south
of
england
would
have
found
many
tracks
and
roads
of
all
types
ready
to
be
linked
so
as
to
form
a
connection
between
important
points
of
trade
government
or
religion
when
it
became
possible
to
traverse
england
safely
meeting
foreign
faces
and
strange
tongues
but
subjects
of
one
king
traders
and
travellers
would
piece
together
according
to
need
the
old
roads
which
different
ages
had
confirmed
the
high
and
most
ancient
roads
like
the
ridgeway
and
the
harrow
way
late
roads
skirting
the
bases
of
the
hills
pure
roman
roads
fearing
nothing
and
romanized
trackways
the
icknield
way
may
have
been
such
a
combination
the
danes
might
have
combined
it
with
the
ridgeway
in
when
they
burnt
wallingford
and
went
by
cholsey
and
cuckhamsley
to
kennet
they
probably
used
the
road
along
the
chilterns
when
they
burnt
thetford
and
cambridge
and
turned
south
to
the
thames
and
other
parts
of
it
when
they
stole
inland
from
their
ships
through
norwich
to
thetford
sweyn
may
have
gone
along
it
when
he
went
to
wallingford
and
so
over
the
thames
westward
to
bath
where
the
western
men
submitted
and
gave
hostages
and
he
became
king
of
the
whole
people
giraldus
may
have
trodden
it
in
south
wales
at
an
earlier
age
as
moray
williams
has
suggested
the
icknield
way
might
have
been
the
line
of
the
iceni
in
their
alleged
migration
westward
after
the
defeat
of
boadicea
it
should
have
been
imogen
s
pathway
to
milford
haven
there
are
not
many
early
references
to
the
travel
upon
the
road
it
would
be
used
chiefly
by
traders
and
travellers
from
a
distance
plot
remarked
that
it
passed
through
no
towns
or
villages
in
oxfordshire
and
this
in
his
day
made
it
convenient
for
stealers
of
cattle
a
road
used
by
strange
travellers
and
robbers
waiting
for
them
was
not
a
likely
one
for
small
settlements
and
local
use
when
it
was
spoken
of
as
the
way
the
oxen
go
unless
the
phrase
implied
a
road
along
which
came
oxen
from
a
distance
it
may
already
have
been
degenerating
guest
says
your
guide
will
talk
of
the
long
lines
of
that
once
frequented
the
ickley
way
as
if
they
were
things
of
yesterday
and
a
farmer
in
the
vale
of
aylesbury
told
me
that
in
the
popish
times
they
used
to
go
on
pilgrimage
along
it
from
oxford
to
jordan
and
morris
to
the
study
of
local
history
and
speak
of
the
road
as
connecting
the
settlement
at
brandon
with
avebury
and
stonehenge
the
men
of
wiltshire
would
wish
to
obtain
flint
instruments
from
brandon
men
from
brandon
to
have
access
to
avebury
and
but
wiltshire
men
would
not
go
to
suffolk
in
search
of
flints
except
for
a
wager
illustration
whiteleaf
cross
the
icknield
way
is
sufficiently
explained
as
the
chief
surviving
road
connecting
east
anglia
and
the
whole
eastern
half
of
the
regions
north
of
the
thames
with
the
west
and
the
western
half
of
the
south
of
england
for
the
men
of
norfolk
suffolk
cambridge
bedford
hertford
buckingham
and
oxford
it
did
what
the
harrow
way
did
for
men
of
kent

sussex
and
east
hampshire
chapter
iii
first
day
thetford
to
newmarket
by
lackford
and
kentford
as
nearly
everybody
was
agreed
that
the
icknield
way
coming
from
the
norfolk
ports
probably
crossed
the
river
thet
and
the
little
ouse
at
thetford
in
that
county
i
went
to
thetford
in
the
railway
train
i
asked
a
man
who
knew
all
the
country
about
him
whether
he
knew
the
icknield
way
but
he
did
not
he
knew
where
the
oaks
and
pines
grew
best
and
what
they
fetched
the
value
of
the
land
the
crops
on
an
acre
of
it
and
what
they
fetched
he
knew
men
s
rents
and
what
each
farm
cost
when
it
changed
hands
last
he
knew
also
the
men
living
and
dead
and
the
lives
they
lived
what
they
were
worth
and
whose
bed
they
died
in
he
was
a
man
himself
a
vast
handsome
fellow
nearing
sixty
well
bearded
whiskered
and
moustached
but
not
so
as
to
hide
full
red
lips
and
small
cheerful
and
penetrating
dark
eyes
he
weighed
eighteen
stone
and
a
half
and
was
not
scant
of
breath
though
he
smoked
strong
tobacco
rapidly
in
a
large
pipe
after
much
about
the
price
of
potatoes
that
came
in
at
one
ear
and
bolted
straight
out
of
the
other
he
told
about
himself
and
his
family
everyone
at
the
railway
stations
knew
him
and
i
suppose
he
thought
i
should
naturally
not
wish
to
remain
he
was
the
youngest
but
one
of
six
brothers
all
weighing
over
sixteen
stone
and
his
two
sisters
weighed
over
fourteen
he
himself
had
eight
children
the
sons
above
six
feet
in
height
the
daughters
above
all
of
them
persons
who
would
not
be
blown
away
in
a
storm
his
father
before
him
was
and
weighed
seventeen
stone
after
a
time
pointing
to
a
satchel
with
my
name
and
address
on
it
he
said
do
you
know
anyone
of
the
name
of
fencer
in
your
neighbourhood
no
i
said
her
father
he
said
used
to
own
the
largease
mill
polly
fencer
very
likely
he
has
gone
away
now
she
may
be
dead
it
is
years
ago
that
i
am
thinking
of
and
i
will
tell
you
what
made
me
ask
my
next
brother
was
in
love
with
her
years
ago
she
was
a
person
and
had
the
nicest
temper
of
anyone
i
ever
met
but
not
soft
or
at
all
weak
she
liked
my
brother
but
she
was
a
companion
to
some
lady
and
she
did
not
want
to
marry
at
once
he
did
however
and
when
she
refused
to
be
in
a
hurry
he
got
cool
for
a
time
in
that
cool
fit
he
married
another
woman
and
had
plenty
of
time
to
repent
it
he
lived
with
her
twenty
years
and
more
and
she
was
always
ailing
he
never
cared
much
about
her
and
now
she
is
dead
and
it
struck
me
seeing
the
address
on
your
bag
that
perhaps
if
polly
was
alive
and
free
and
hadn
t
altered
her
mind
my
brother
might
be
glad
to
marry
her
certainly
he
couldn
t
do
a
better
thing
than
marry
polly
i
know
he
never
forgot
her
but
years
is
a
long
time
and
she
may
be
married
herself
i
should
have
liked
to
see
him
marry
polly
one
of
the
nicest
women
that
ever
i
saw
illustration
castle
hill
thetford
i
used
to
be
very
fond
of
walking
myself
he
said
changing
the
subject
and
i
still
do
a
lot
of
it
it
is
very
good
for
the
health
i
suppose
you
are
walking
for
your
as
he
perceived
that
i
was
not
in
business
he
assumed
that
i
was
taking
a
dose
of
walking
one
of
the
most
expensive
medicines
and
as
he
believed
one
of
the
best
i
left
him
behind
me
in
thetford
this
was
a
most
pleasant
ancient
town
built
of
flints
full
of
turns
and
corners
and
yards
it
smelt
of
lime
trees
and
of
brewing
at
the
east
edge
was
a
green
castle
hill
and
a
surrounding
rampart
without
a
castle
and
between
the
ramparts
round
about
the
hill
a
level
green
where
people
rest
or
play
in
sunshine
or
under
elm
ash
and
sycamore
beside
the
steep
artificial
mound
so
huge
and
uncouth
men
mowing
the
grass
looked
smaller
than
ever
the
children
playing
more
beautiful
and
both
more
transitory
the
dark
hill
seemed
a
monster
watching
them
at
their
play
and
work
as
if
some
day
it
would
swallow
them
up
it
was
like
a
personification
of
stupid
enormous
time
yet
this
ponderous
symbol
did
not
spoil
the
pleasantness
of
the
grass
and
trees
and
the
green
hill
and
the
little
town
but
rather
increased
it
and
i
walked
backwards
and
forwards
lest
i
should
forget
that
i
had
been
to
thetford
a
place
sometimes
burnt
sometimes
fortified
by
the
danes
and
once
a
bishop
s
see
these
things
made
the
old
brewery
seem
older
the
lime
trees
sweeter
the
lanes
darker
as
i
walked
about
one
of
the
lanes
castle
lane
which
goes
through
the
ramparts
of
the
castle
is
possibly
part
of
the
icknield
way
as
you
stand
at
the
east
edge
of
the
town
a
little
past
the
castle
hill
a
lane
comes
slanting
from
the
over
the
railway
to
an
open
dusty
place
at
a
meeting
of
five
ways
a
five
went
this
lane
now
only
a
mile
long
to
where
it
is
cut
short
by
the
kilverstone
and
brettenham
road
and
having
no
obvious
continuation
to
the
is
the
green
lane
or
clover
lane
which
has
been
suggested
as
a
norfolk
portion
of
the
icknield
way
at
the
south
end
of
it
in
were
found
remains
of
celtic
and
roman
pottery
castle
lane
takes
up
the
line
of
green
lane
and
leads
through
the
east
edge
of
the
town
towards
the
rivers
before
leaving
the
town
by
it
i
noticed
on
the
right
hand
a
very
strange
fish
on
a
signboard
a
very
curly
fish
with
curly
whiskers
three
curled
plumes
on
his
back
and
a
curled
tail
and
he
was
himself
curled
and
boldly
painted
withal
but
whether
this
fish
or
the
landlord
was
named
mullett
i
have
forgotten
my
apparent
road
took
me
southward
over
the
thet
and
then
the
ouse
by
two
low
bridges
called
the
nuns
bridges
chestnuts
darkened
the
clear
water
of
thet
between
the
two
rivers
was
only
a
narrow
space
of
grass
and
buttercups
here
and
a
little
east
towards
place
farm
is
the
gravel
which
fitted
this
spot
for
a
ford
beyond
the
ouse
the
main
road
goes
straight
away
southward
to
the
workhouse
the
open
sandy
heath
and
ultimately
bury
edmunds
on
the
left
was
the
isolated
doorway
of
a
vanished
nunnery
and
place
farm
standing
within
a
wide
space
i
turned
to
the
right
along
a
road
parallel
with
the
river
and
divided
from
it
by
a
narrow
hedgeless
band
of
grass
this
is
supposed
by
clarke
to
be
the
icknield
way
and
he
has
sketched
it
over
the
bury
and
thetford
road
north
of
the
gasworks
near
where
the
remains
of
a
british
settlement
were
found
in
but
i
found
nothing
to
save
me
from
going
on
to
the
main
road
to
mildenhall
and
newmarket
and
then
following
that
for
two
miles
on
the
ten
miles
between
thetford
and
mildenhall
there
is
nothing
but
elveden
church
milestones
and
dust
and
mildenhall
is
only
the
village
to
newmarket
it
is
a
straight
road
easily
provoked
to
a
fierce
whiteness
and
it
goes
through
a
dry
heathy
land
planted
with
limes
and
parallelograms
of
fir
trees
nevertheless
a
nightingale
was
singing
at
noon
in
the
blaze
of
a
strong
sun
close
to
the
left
side
of
the
road
not
a
mile
out
of
thetford
his
voice
in
the
heat
was
like
the
milky
kernel
of
a
hard
bearded
nut
less
than
half
a
mile
past
the
second
milestone
and
just
over
the
suffolk
border
i
took
the
opportunity
of
leaving
that
road
by
entering
a
private
drive
apparently
to
elveden
hall
this
was
at
least
in
the
right
direction
for
lackford
the
next
ford
near
which
the
icknield
way
is
satisfactorily
ascertained
in
of
a
mile
the
drive
emerged
into
a
road
coming
from
the
main
road
i
had
left
and
going
east
to
barnham
i
turned
to
the
left
along
this
to
reach
marmansgrave
wood
which
sounded
old
and
at
that
point
as
i
hoped
a
cart
track
crossing
the
road
from
north
to
south
looked
possible
as
it
fell
out
this
track
was
a
parish
boundary
and
the
boundary
between
the
hundreds
of
blackbourn
and
lackford
and
for
more
than
half
its
course
it
was
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
an
oak
or
fir
plantation
i
went
southward
along
it
down
the
east
edge
of
the
long
fir
plantation
marked
on
the
map
as
new
barnham
it
was
a
broad
and
hedgeless
track
often
riddled
by
rabbit
burrows
which
were
masked
by
nettles
at
its
best
it
was
a
rough
tussocky
sheaf
of
cartways
everywhere
sand
and
flints
parallelograms
of
fir
trees
nettles
and
more
nettles
and
the
smell
of
nettles
rarely
it
passed
a
square
now
or
several
years
ago
given
to
corn
i
like
nettles
especially
with
elder
trees
in
blossom
above
them
as
at
lackford
road
heath
along
there
was
also
some
gorse
the
road
was
not
straight
but
wound
along
in
a
series
of
straight
lines
slightly
up
and
down
but
usually
on
the
high
level
sand
with
views
of
nothing
else
i
had
no
company
but
pewit
and
and
wheatear
for
those
seven
miles
and
neither
passed
a
house
nor
saw
one
anywhere
the
sun
blazed
from
the
sky
overhead
and
the
sand
underfoot
it
burnt
the
scent
out
of
the
pines
as
in
an
oven
it
made
the
land
still
and
silent
but
it
wrenched
no
word
or
thought
of
blasphemy
out
of
me
on
the
other
hand
i
felt
no
benevolence
towards
the
planters
of
trees
in
straight
lines
for
by
doing
this
they
had
destroyed
the
possible
sublimity
of
this
sandy
land
and
at
the
same
time
increased
its
desolation
by
the
contrasting
verdure
of
foliage
and
the
obviously
utilitarian
arrangement
it
was
country
which
if
i
owned
it
i
should
gladly
exchange
with
the
war
office
for
salisbury
plain
for
if
the
nettles
the
rabbit
holes
and
the
elders
were
exceptionally
good
they
could
be
equalled
the
rabbits
seemed
to
love
the
track
as
in
other
places
they
love
tumuli
and
for
a
distance
they
had
wiped
out
its
resemblance
to
a
road
crossing
the
brandon
and
wordwell
road
at
shelterhouse
corner
or
elveden
gap
i
reached
the
east
end
of
the
icklingham
belt
of
firs
from
near
the
west
end
of
this
belt
goes
a
path
called
pilgrim
s
path
down
to
icklingham
all
saints
church
this
is
said
not
to
be
the
icknield
way
though
icklingham
partly
on
account
of
its
name
and
partly
on
account
of
its
great
age
and
roman
villa
has
been
alleged
to
be
on
the
road
two
miles
east
of
my
road
at
lackford
road
heath
is
a
traveller
s
hill
marked
by
a
tumulus
but
this
is
an
road
and
ends
at
a
farm
i
continued
over
jennet
s
hill
and
along
the
edge
of
a
second
and
greater
icklingham
belt
and
past
some
cultivated
fields
on
the
right
sunk
two
yards
or
so
below
the
level
of
the
track
then
i
dipped
down
among
corn
and
deeper
grass
and
between
good
hedges
at
last
towards
the
river
lark
the
cool
valley
and
the
broader
woods
of
lackford
and
cavenham
at
the
foot
of
the
descent
a
road
crosses
to
west
stow
and
in
half
a
mile
passes
a
gravel
pit
and
the
place
where
coins
weapons
and
arms
have
been
found
after
this
crossing
there
were
water
meadows
with
swift
crystal
flashing
among
buttercups
and
flag
blossom
the
home
of
snipe
the
great
meadow
on
the
right
is
called
rampart
meadow
because
of
the
sudden
lift
of
the
land
at
its
far
side
which
seems
to
be
ringed
like
an
old
camp
with
ramparts
just
before
the
river
the
road
became
merged
in
the
main
road
from
mildenhall
to
bury
edmunds
alongside
the
bridge
was
the
ford
and
the
path
to
it
was
hollowed
out
beside
the
road
on
the
south
over
the
bridge
the
boundary

the

and
ford
lackford
lackford
is
a
village
that
straggles
along
a
mile
of
road
with
such
intervals
of
foliage
that
i
thought
i
was
past
the
end
of
it
when
i
came
to
where
i
could
get
tea
there
was
no
inn
but
the
shop
was
better
than
the
inn
could
have
been
my
hostess
was
one
of
those
most
active
little
stoutish
and
cheerful
women
who
never
go
out
if
they
can
help
it
being
descended
from
suffering
and
sometimes
roofless
generations
they
seem
to
see
no
reason
for
returning
to
inclement
nature
when
they
have
a
good
digestion
and
a
roof
they
make
good
jam
and
good
tea
there
were
a
number
of
things
i
should
have
seen
near
lackford
such
as
the
burial
mound
north
of
culford
church
wittily
called
the
hill
of
health
and
the
road
between
pakenham
and
stowlangtoft
called
bull
road
and
some
of
the
moats
at
maulkin
s
hall
and
other
halls
of
suffolk
but
the
icknield
way
turned
sharp
to
the
right
out
of
the
road
i
had
taken
opposite
lower
farm
soon
after
the
ford
of
the
lark
when
it
was
more
important
than
the
eastward
road
to
bury
the
way
curved
round
westward
beyond
the
river
and
its
old
course
is
marked
by
a
depression
through
the
furze
on
the
right
which
finally
reaches
the
present
road
and
is
lost
in
it
illustration
near
cavenham
my
road
was
now
an
ordinary
white
road
between
hedges
but
with
a
furzy
heath
on
both
sides
beyond
the
hedges
it
had
no
grassy
borders
but
at
the
turning
to
lackford
there
was
a
little
triangular
common
on
the
left
of
grass
gorse
hawthorns
and
an
ash
tree
on
the
right
there
was
a
larger
common
called
clamp
s
heath
on
my
left
i
saw
corn
and
a
field
of
pale
sainfoin
extending
to
the
edge
of
a
dark
oak
wood
the
road
was
if
anything
slightly
embanked
over
this
level
ground
after
passing
the
heath
it
had
grassy
borders
and
low
hedges
and
corn
on
both
sides
and
then
after
a
short
distance
no
border
and
on
the
right
no
hedge
where
it
descended
towards
the
woods
of
cavenham
it
was
sunk
a
little
and
had
a
border
of
grass
just
before
this
i
saw
the
first
chalk
pit
under
the
road
on
my
left
with
wild
rose
and
elder
on
its
floor
at
cavenham
a
new
flat
bridge
of
two
arches
crossed
a
tiny
tributary
of
the
lark
but
on
the
left
of
this
was
an
old
single
arch
about
seven
feet
broad
of
narrow
bricks
still
firm
but
all
over
its
high
curved
crown
which
passengers
used
to
mount
like
a
barrel
the
new
bridge
probably
took
the
ford
s
place
at
cavenham
the
road
went
under
the
trees
of
cavenham
park
oak
beech
elm
and
sycamore
ash
and
aspen
were
cooing
unseen
the
house
was
some
way
off
the
church
farther
the
village
yet
farther
along
a
at
each
turning
there
was
an
open
space
for
trees
and
men
for
example
at
the
two
ways
down
to
lark
hall
beyond
the
second
of
these
the
road
was
lined
by
beech
trees
and
wych
elms
standing
in
grass
it
was
cool
but
gave
a
view
of
sunlit
barley
between
the
trunks
and
soon
afterwards
of
an
undulating
lowland
heath
and
corn
and
wooded
ridges
on
the
right
while
on
the
left
the
land
fell
away
and
i
felt
the
curve
of
the
earth
the
wooded
horizon
being
lower
than
the
road
before
reaching
tuddenham
corner
the
bank
of
bird
trefoil
was
wide
enough
for
a
path
only
on
the
left
was
there
a
hedge
on
the
right
was
tall
barley
past
tuddenham
corner
the
road
was
narrow
and
shaded
by
beech
trees
of
half
a
century
s
growth
it
had
hedges
and
grassy
borders
and
down
the
middle
two
lines
of
grass
between
the
ordinary
course
of
the
horses
feet
and
the
wheels
on
both
sides
were
many
long
straight
plantations
of
trees
but
in
a
low
cultivated
country
where
they
gave
little
offence
presently
the
road
touched
a
tumulus
on
the
left
and
drew
near
another
on
the
right
then
it
was
crossed
by
the
great
eastern
railway
and
turning
sharper
to
the
right
than
probably
it
used
to
went
due
west
towards
kentford
being
now
a
highway
between
newmarket
and
bury
edmunds
it
was
broader
and
had
also
grassy
margins
of
twice
its
own
width
and
beeches
in
the
hedgerows
illustration
kentford
until
this
i
had
met
and
passed
nobody
nor
had
anyone
passed
me
no
man
of
lackford
or
cavenham
or
vagrant
bound
for
norwich
or
newmarket
no
sailor
son
whom
i
could
tell
of
his
expectant
mother
selling
roses
at
piccadilly
circus
at
kentford
tyrannically
owned
the
road
here
were
men
going
into
the
fox
and
bull
or
standing
contented
by
the
old
in
the
shade
of
the
old
flint
church
tower
and
the
chestnuts
of
the
churchyard
someone
was
cheerfully
clipping
grass
at
evenfall
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
greyhound
as
a
weather
vane
and
it
was
running
northward
a
ford
went
through
the
kennett
and
a
new
bridge
over
it
alongside
of
great
fragments
of
an
old
one
just
beyond
at
the
cool
heart
of
the
dusty
roadside
shrubberies
a
nightingale
was
singing
in
oblivion
from
kentford
the
road
ran
straight
for
four
miles
into
newmarket
taking
with
it
the
suffolk
and
cambridge
boundary
now
on
its
right
and
now
on
its
left
telegraph
posts
and
trees
accompanied
it
and
below
them
very
broad
rough
margins
half
overgrown
by
thorns
and
young
elms
and
marked
by
half
a
dozen
parallel
footpaths
the
old
course
of
the
road
from
the
third
milestone
was
doubtless
the
green
track
on
the
right
divided
from
the
new
by
a
broken
hedge
for
it
is
this
that
the
boundary
follows
before
the
second
milestone
this
track
traversed
the
new
and
was
continued
thenceforward
by
a
beech
grove
shadowing
deep
narrow
to
the
first
milestone
and
the
beginning
of
the
newmarket
red
brick
on
the
right
no
hedge
came
between
the
road
and
an
open
country
sloping
down
to
the
treeless
fenland
of
fordham
wicken
and
soham
where
fifty
feet
above
makes
a
hill
nearest
the
road
were
plains
from
which
tumuli
have
long
been
smoothed
to
make
an
exercising
ground
for
horses
by
the
first
milestone
a
child
came
running
up
to
me
to
ask
if
i
had
found
a
penny
among
the
trees
and
i
did
not
until
afterwards
suspect
that
this
was
a
brilliant
variation
from
straightforward
begging
illustration
newmarket
as
i
came
into
newmarket
before
dark
but
after
the
closing
of
shops
the
long
wide
street
and
a
strange
breed
of
men
standing
or
slowly
walking
about
on
its
pavements
made
me
feel
that
scarcely
after
a
dozen
reincarnations
should
i
enter
newmarket
and
be
at
home
the
man
who
discovered
that
we
are
all
god
s
creatures
had
an
uncanny
eye
for
resemblance
and
i
often
doubt
the
use
of
the
discovery
without
disputing
its
accuracy
everyone
was
talking
of
horses
except
those
who
preferred
lords
and
professional
golfers
i
saw
some
caddies
industriously
swallowing
temperance
hot
drinks
instead
of
beer
in
the
hope
of
earning
as
much
as
james
braid
at
some
distant
time
as
for
the
horsy
men
they
seemed
to
understand
lords
as
well
as
horses
so
well
as
to
illustrate
the
saying
to
know
all
is
to
pardon
all
nay
to
go
beyond
that
to
admire
all
and
to
believe
that
men
are
more
or
less
worthy
as
they
are
more
or
less
lords
one
of
them
was
imitating
the
bad
language
of
lord
and
it
was
admitted
perfect
but
i
can
quite
believe
that
to
be
a
lord
is
very
different
from
being
able
to
imitate
one
after
a
glass
of
ale
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
to
the
influence
of
either
lords
or
horses
or
perhaps
both
we
must
attribute
the
brilliant
beggar
at
the
first
milestone
a
scotch
baker
directed
me
to
a
place
it
is
not
very
elaborate
but
it
is
clean
where
i
could
get
a
bed
such
as
i
could
afford
i
lay
awake
for
some
time
listening
to
the
most
of
them
rushed
through
the
town
a
few
came
there
to
rest
and
silence
others
paused
for
a
minute
only
with
drumming
suspense
i
thought
i
should
not
easily
tire
of
these
signals
from
unknown
travellers
not
that
i
spent
much
time
on
definite
and
persistent
conjecture
as
to
who
they
were
whence
they
had
come
and
whither
and
why
they
travelled
i
was
too
sleepy
though
at
any
time
such
a
labour
would
have
been
irksome
no
i
was
more
than
content
to
let
these
noises
compose
a
wordless
music
of
mystery
and
adventure
within
my
brain
the
cars
could
bring
together
lovers
or
enemies
or
conspirators
so
swiftly
that
their
midnight
alarums
suggest
nothing
else
it
is
hard
to
connect
their
subjugated
frenzy
with
mere
stupid
haste
the
little
light
steals
through
a
darkness
so
vast
that
the
difference
between
a
star
and
a
lantern
is
nothing
to
it
the
thing
is
so
suitable
for
a
great
adventure
that
straightway
the
mind
conceives
one
hark
on
a
winter
s
night
the
sound
and
the
idea
are
worthy
of
the
storm
and
in
harmony
with
it
hark
tis
an
elfin
storm
from
fairyland
of
haggard
seeming
but
a
boon
indeed
it
was
easy
to
imagine
myself
the
partner
in
magnificent
risks
quite
outside
my
own
experience
and
to
feel
the
glory
and
even
the
danger
with
no
touch
of
pain
whilst
i
lay
as
careless
as
the
friendly
near
neighbourhood
of
sleep
could
make
me
the
touch
of
arrogance
in
the
voice
of
the
motor
is
to
its
credit
by
night
in
a
measure
it
revives
the
romantic
and
accepted
arrogance
of
horn
and
trumpet
it
gives
at
least
an
outward
bravery
which
has
long
been
dropping
away
from
drivers
of
horses
i
do
not
disparage
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
and
the
private
voice
of
a
solitary
traveller
on
the
dark
roads
but
there
is
something
melancholy
in
it
and
more
endurance
than
enterprise
but
above
all
the
sounds
of
the
have
added
immensely
to
the
london
night
at
least
for
good
sleepers
with
minds
at
ease
formerly
to
those
out
of
the
covent
garden
routes
the
only
sound
of
night
travel
at
all
provoking
to
the
mind
was
the
hansom
s
clatter
which
challenged
conjecture
more
often
than
imagination
i
pictured
most
likely
a
man
with
bleared
eyes
and
a
white
shirt
who
had
let
his
cigar
out
at
most
a
man
whose
achievement
was
behind
rather
than
before
him
and
certainly
i
was
always
very
well
content
to
be
in
bed
but
the
is
turbulent
and
daring
though
it
may
be
innocent
to
say
so
even
if
it
is
coming
home
there
is
a
proud
possibility
of
distance
left
behind
and
either
it
seems
that
the
arrivers
have
not
returned
for
nothing
or
the
sudden
stop
suggests
at
the
least
a
sublimity
of
dejection
from
proud
heights
as
to
the
car
setting
out
in
darkness
it
gathers
to
itself
all
the
pomp
of
setting
out
as
we
have
imagined
or
read
of
it
in
stories
of
soldiers
travellers
or
lovers
and
as
we
have
experienced
it
when
children
going
to
fish
or
to
find
bird
s
nests
or
mushrooms
and
as
we
still
fancy
it
would
be
for
ourselves
were
we
ever
to
advance
towards
adventures
i
suppose
also
that
the
speed
of
a
to
the
outsider
unconsciously
suggests
a
race
an
unknown
end
an
untold
prize
these
thoughts
and
mere
listening
to
the
horns
and
machinery
occupied
me
and
led
on
to
sleep
in
such
a
manner
that
i
ignored
a
man
next
door
imitating
a
gramophone
quite
seriously
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
i
was
asleep
and
began
to
dream
drivel
chapter
iv
second
day
newmarket
to
odsey
by
ickleton
and
royston
next
morning
i
paid
two
shillings
and
set
out
at
six
o
clock
so
far
as
is
known
the
icknield
way
which
certainly
went
through
newmarket
is
the
central
street
and
london
road
and
along
this
i
mounted
out
of
the
town
the
road
was
a
straight
and
dusty
one
accompanied
by
a
great
multitude
of
telegraph
wires
on
which
corn
buntings
were
singing
their
dreary
song
on
the
right
was
the
main
stretch
of
newmarket
heath
then
a
few
gentle
green
slopes
with
clusters
of
ricks
and
squares
of
corn
rising
to
a
low
wooded
ridge
far
off
it
was
beginning
to
be
hot
though
it
was
windy
and
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
was
visible
only
through
folds
in
the
hood
of
grey
clouds
there
were
dusty
tracks
for
exercising
horses
on
both
sides
of
the
road
i
like
to
see
fine
horses
running
at
full
speed
to
see
this
sight
or
hounds
running
on
a
good
scent
or
children
dancing
is
to
me
the
same
as
music
and
therefore
i
suppose
as
full
of
mortality
and
beauty
i
sat
down
for
some
time
watching
the
horses
illustration
devil
s
ditch
beyond
the
second
milestone
and
just
before
the
turning
to
the
right
for
cambridge
the
road
passed
through
the
devil
s
ditch
a
deep
ditch
with
a
high
bank
on
the
newmarket
edge
of
it
stretching
several
miles
on
either
side
of
the
way
from
to
in
a
straight
line
at
the
gap
made
by
the
road
stood
what
seemed
to
be
old
turnpike
houses
beyond
the
ditch
the
road
was
a
hedged
one
shaded
by
beeches
on
both
sides
and
having
borders
of
deep
dusty
grass
in
which
stood
the
telegraph
posts
the
long
narrow
copse
of
beech
on
the
right
was
not
strictly
closed
but
remained
unspoilt
and
tenanted
by
doves
yet
it
was
not
long
before
i
began
to
look
out
for
a
cart
to
carry
me
over
the
next
six
miles
of
the
straight
road
such
a
road
is
tiring
because
either
the
eye
or
the
mind
s
eye
sees
long
taunting
or
menacing
lengths
before
it
and
is
brought
into
conflict
with
sheer
distance
and
the
mind
is
continually
trying
to
carry
the
body
over
this
distance
with
her
own
celerity
and
being
again
and
again
defeated
and
more
and
more
conscious
of
defeat
becomes
irritated
if
not
happily
numbed
by
the
importunate
monotony
this
was
country
moreover
which
the
unaided
eye
could
easily
explore
it
lay
open
and
without
mystery
nothing
had
to
be
climbed
or
quested
for
therefore
still
more
did
the
legs
resent
doing
what
wheels
or
other
legs
could
do
far
better
any
wheeled
vehicle
from
a
to
a
legless
beggar
s
trolley
would
help
a
man
through
this
country
in
wiltshire
or
cardiganshire
there
is
nothing
so
good
as
your
own
legs
even
if
they
are
bad
but
in
cambridgeshire
i
recommend
elephant
camel
horse
mule
donkey
waggon
or
cart
anything
except
a
covered
cab
or
a
pair
of
hobnailed
shoes
a
fine
region
spread
out
upon
the
right
as
i
was
approaching
six
mile
bottom
a
sweep
of
arable
mostly
but
with
reddish
squares
and
here
and
there
a
team
at
work
rising
up
to
a
copse
or
two
on
the
low
ridges
not
a
building
visible
but
a
windmill
and
far
beyond
these
blue
hills
a
very
simple
country
it
was
that
might
have
been
moulded
by
a
strong
north
wind
when
the
land
was
docile
as
snow
over
it
hung
a
sky
of
perfect
summer
and
a
sun
like
a
god
that
made
me
ashamed
to
crawl
as
habit
and
the
necessity
of
writing
a
book
compelled
me
to
do
it
was
a
country
for
clouds
but
there
was
none
had
there
been
i
should
not
have
been
so
well
acquainted
with
the
hard
straight
road
often
slightly
embanked
or
having
depressions
on
either
side
and
in
the
one
several
paths
by
the
turning
to
weston
colville
and
west
wratting
it
went
level
and
straight
as
usual
on
the
left
the
corn
was
hedgeless
on
the
right
a
low
hedge
separated
me
from
ploughland
and
the
windmill
on
a
ridge
and
the
depression
on
the
left
was
thrice
the
width
of
the
road
and
used
as
a
cart
track
with
merely
a
white
centre
and
ruts
among
the
flowers
of
plantain
and
lady
s
slipper
many
larks
were
singing
i
became
a
connoisseur
in
and
noticed
each
change
as
that
when
the
road
was
cut
or
embanked
it
usually
lost
its
breadth
of
margin
and
that
now
there
was
a
hedge
on
both
hands
instead
of
one
and
in
them
roses
the
pink
roses
which
have
the
pure
slender
perfume
connected
by
the
with
youth
illustration
fleam
dyke
past
the
eighth
milestone
the
road
went
through
fleam
dyke
which
is
shorter
than
the
devil
s
ditch
because
the
fen
to
which
it
stretches
northward
is
nearer
the
ditch
is
on
the
far
side
a
green
farm
track
goes
along
the
mound
on
the
near
or
newmarket
side
just
before
it
i
saw
a
green
way
a
parish
boundary
branching
up
out
of
my
road
eastward
between
separate
thorns
and
making
over
the
highland
to
the
valley
of
the
stour
beyond
the
dyke
was
another
fine
open
cornland
northward
lines
of
trees
down
its
slopes
woods
on
its
ridges
and
the
tall
chimneys
of
cambridge
six
miles
away
on
the
other
hand
a
beech
plantation
lined
the
road
and
shadowed
the
grassy
edge
on
which
i
walked
after
the
beeches
there
were
wayside
roses
and
a
low
hedge
and
still
a
broad
grassy
border
where
the
young
blackbirds
hurried
before
me
among
the
paper
wrappers
of
sausages
thrown
out
by
motorists
from
cambridge
on
my
right
was
an
artificial
wall
of
turf
going
in
the
same
direction
as
the
road
this
might
have
been
an
ancient
earthwork
if
the
map
had
not
said
old
a
disused
railway
embankment
gave
me
more
pleasure
than
a
prehistoric
dyke
it
was
also
charming
in
itself
and
had
thorns
prettily
growing
on
its
green
slopes
soon
it
was
changed
to
a
cutting
and
above
it
a
little
round
rise
crowned
by
eight
poor
firs
in
a
tragic
group
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
road
past
the
tenth
milestone
the
main
road
reaches
worsted
lodge
and
crosses
the
straight
line
of
a
roman
road
from
grantchester
and
godmanchester
the
line
of
my
road
is
continued
by
a
lesser
way
to
babraham
and
pampisford
but
the
road
itself
turns
abruptly
from
a
almost
to
a
southerly
course
yet
still
straight
nearly
all
the
roads
hereabout
were
as
straight
as
if
roman
the
low
and
even
land
offering
no
impediments
there
was
one
for
example
parallel
with
the
roman
road
and
crossing
the
icknield
way
exactly
at
the
tenth
milestone
having
come
down
from
fulbourn
valley
farm
alongside
a
regiment
of
beeches
and
continuing
after
an
interruption
by
a
kitchen
garden
to
gunner
s
hall
beyond
between
this
and
the
roman
road
at
the
wayside
was
a
long
building
of
respectable
age
with
a
mansard
roof
small
latticed
windows
in
three
tiers
and
a
louvre
on
top
like
a
small
oast
cone
the
line
of
the
old
railway
continued
to
be
marked
by
a
slight
bank
and
thickets
of
thorns
my
road
had
broad
green
borders
which
the
copse
of
grange
farm
interrupted
there
were
now
more
copses
and
the
land
was
more
broken
up
though
still
mainly
supporting
corn
and
hurdled
sheep
at
bourn
bridge
near
the
twelfth
milestone
there
was
a
ford
through
the
granta
shaded
by
elms
and
poplars
and
occupied
by
cattle
swishing
their
tails
in
silence
at
the
milestone
the
common
road
to
royston
branches
off
to
the
right
with
broad
green
borders
but
my
way
lay
straight
on
over
the
new
railway
by
pampisford
station
and
through
brent
ditch
after
the
thirteenth
milestone
the
old
railway
had
gathered
quite
a
copse
of
ash
and
thorn
and
brier
about
it
near
the
fourteenth
milestone
i
began
to
see
a
pleasant
valley
land
below
on
the
right
and
groves
marking
the
cam
s
course
by
the
spires
of
hinxton
and
ickleton
and
beyond
them
gentle
bare
hills
with
crowns
of
trees
at
this
milestone
i
saw
myriads
of
a
most
delicate
blue
flax
shuddering
in
the
wind
here
essex
comes
up
to
the
road
and
pursues
it
to
ickleton
even
though
at
stump
cross
it
turns
sharp
to
the
right
out
of
the
london
road
and
becomes
a
lane
to
ickleton
a
green
lane
with
white
ruts
making
for
the
church
and
crossing
an
artificial
embankment
which
turned
out
to
be
the
old
railway
again
my
road
forded
the
cam
at
ickleton
this
was
a
quiet
white
and
grey
village
built
partly
about
the
road
which
encircles
the
church
but
chiefly
on
both
sides
of
a
road
leading
west
the
walls
were
of
flint
or
of
plaster
sometimes
decorated
with
patterns
in
line
and
there
was
abundant
thatch
here
and
there
the
cottages
were
interrupted
and
a
gateway
opened
into
a
the
church
a
flint
one
was
as
cool
as
it
was
old
and
full
of
christened
sunlight
and
the
chirping
of
sparrows
there
were
many
tablets
in
it
to
the
memory
of
people
named
hanchett
a
name
not
in
the
of
national
the
most
conspicuous
thing
in
the
church
was
a
circular
frame
over
an
arch
enclosing
the
inscription
in
large
letters
this
church
was
repair

henry
chambers
and
john

smaller

the
illustration
ickleton
leaving
ickleton
by
its
chief
street
abbey
street
i
entered
an
open
country
rising
on
all
sides
i
took
the
road
towards
elmdon
and
then
a
turning
out
of
that
which
went
in
a
straight
line
to
ickleton
granges
this
is
probably
a
new
country
road
with
hedges
and
only
the
narrowest
of
green
strips
beside
it
it
is
not
the
icknield
way
the
old
road
possibly
ran
along
the
gently
rising
ploughland
up
it
past
rectory
farm
there
is
still
a
footpath
from
near
abbey
farm
and
the
priory
remains
to
rectory
farm
which
may
represent
the
course
of
the
icknield
way
continued
by
a
broken
line
of
thorns
reaching
almost
to
ickleton
granges
fifty
or
a
hundred
yards
of
the
present
road
past
the
granges
i
turned
sharp
to
the
right
along
a
drove
coming
through
the
corn
from
littlebury
and
saffron
walden
at
a
turning
on
the
left
to
redland
s
hall
this
road
became
a
county
boundary
and
i
went
uphill
to
the
corner
of
a
copse
where
it
made
another
bend
westward
at
the
bend
there
was
a
triangle
of
turf
upon
the
right
so
that
the
bank
which
lies
beyond
this
turf
suggested
a
road
coming
from
the
east
that
is
to
say
from
rectory
farm
and
ickleton
priory
the
road
was
now
well
up
above
the
land
to
its
right
and
i
could
see
the
straight
ridge
near
cambridge
which
carries
the
mare
way
on
the
other
hand
were
the
gentle
anthony
hill
and
clay
hill
and
in
front
the
high
land
above
royston
and
its
straight
bars
of
wood
the
road
was
making
almost
due
west
for
royston
it
went
between
corn
clover
or
land
white
bryony
grew
in
its
low
hedges
and
even
sprawled
over
the
dusty
rabbity
mound
by
the
wayside
and
it
had
grass
borders
of
its
own
width
at
first
it
was
rough
but
hard
and
white
soon
it
became
practically
a
green
road
and
then
wholly
so
but
level
and
rideable
in
one
place
it
was
lined
by
lime
trees
in
others
all
was
elder
flower
wild
rose
and
lady
s
slipper
and
the
chatter
of
young
birds
beyond
the
road
to
dottrell
hall
and
the
lovely
group
of
sycamore
and
hornbeams
at
the
crossing
it
was
much
worn
again
it
was
a
farm
road
used
only
by
waggons
and
men
between
field
and
field
or
at
most
between
farm
and
farm
it
might
have
seemed
no
more
than
a
series
four
miles
long
of
consecutive
cart
tracks
rarely
with
a
hedge
on
both
sides
between
it
and
the
cultivated
land
it
gave
a
sense
of
privacy
and
freedom
combined
at
a
cottage
one
of
two
that
had
once
been
a
single
farm
and
still
had
a
thatched
shed
and
a
weedy
yard
i
knocked
to
ask
for
water
illustration
approaching
royston
a
huge
wheel
and
windlass
and
a
tub
stood
above
a
well
in
the
yard
a
cat
bounded
through
the
window
of
one
of
the
cottages
which
seemed
to
be
empty
the
other
might
also
have
been
empty
in
spite
of
its
dirty
muslin
curtain
for
i
knocked
long
and
no
one
came
just
as
i
was
turning
to
get
water
for
myself
a
human
being
with
black
hair
and
wild
eyes
looked
out
of
an
upper
window
and
hailed
me
with
a
kind
of
scream
as
she
was
not
half
dressed
i
told
her
to
leave
me
to
look
after
myself
the
well
seemed
bottomless
but
i
had
the
seven
gallons
of
dark
bright
water
up
on
the
edge
by
the
time
my
hostess
appeared
with
a
dirty
cup
she
was
a
thin
woman
bare
and
brown
to
the
breast
and
with
glittering
blue
eyes
and
in
her
upper
jaw
three
strong
teeth
she
was
dressed
in
black
rags
she
shaded
her
eyes
to
look
at
me
as
if
i
were
half
a
mile
away
you
re
thin
boy
she
said
like
a
pause
are
you
middling
well
off
yes
middling
are
you
oh
middling
but
times
are
they
she
looked
extraordinarily
sad
and
i
said
still
we
shall
have
a
few
years
to
wait
for
the
have
to
wait
a
few
years
she
repeated
very
serious
though
smiling
have
you
come
from
royston
no
newmarket
are
you
going
far
to
odsey
between
royston
and
it
s
a
long

you
re

doesn
t
nourish

can
not
live
on
bread
only
not
even
brown
bread
made
at
now
in
the
moon
perhaps
i
should
get
perhaps
indeed
and
i
too
but
look
at
the
moon
you
give
me
the
horrors
you
couldn
t
live
it
was
a
thin
of
a
circle
in
a
hot
sky
but
i
said
i
should
like
to
would
you
yes
provided
i
were
someone
different
for
as
for
me
this
is
no
doubt
the
best
of
all
possible
better
than
the
moon
yes
better
than
the
moon
and
there
is
nothing
better
in
it
than
your
well
water
missus
good
framed
clearly
against
her
solitary
cottage
she
stared
after
me
shading
her
eyes
two
or
three
times
along
these
four
miles
of
road
i
saw
a
square
of
trees
protecting
a
farm
or
grange
most
of
the
villages
having
a
grange
out
in
the
open
country
named
after
them
as
duxford
grange
ickleton
grange
chrishall
grange
heydon
grange
but
on
the
road
itself
there
were
no
houses
except
noon
s
folly
and
one
called
shapens
not
even
at
the
crossings
of
more
important
roads
for
the
most
part
it
kept
level
where
it
had
to
dip
slightly
after
the
turn
to
great
chishall
it
was
worn
several
feet
deep
but
this
was
exceptional
beyond
that
it
was
worn
unevenly
into
two
parallel
tracks
between
hedges
with
beech
trees
and
elders
to
the
right
the
pleasant
rise
of
goffer
s
knoll
stood
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
main
newmarket
and
royston
road
now
fast
nearing
my
road
past
noon
s
folly
farm
the
road
had
a
narrow
and
embanked
course
but
parallel
with
it
a
depression
seamed
by
paths
and
cart
tracks
here
and
for
some
way
past
from
between
noon
s
folly
and
the
barley
road
the
way
is
a
boundary
between
cambridgeshire
and
hertfordshire
i
had
not
been
out
of
cambridgeshire
since
i
left
suffolk
at
the
kennett
bridge
illustration
icknield
way
crossing
ermine
street
half
a
mile
west
of
noon
s
folly
the
main
road
reached
my
road
and
turning
west
instead
of
made
use
of
its
course
for
the
two
miles
into
royston
for
most
of
the
two
miles
this
piece
of
road
exactly
continuing
my
old
way
had
broad
green
edges
and
on
the
left
hand
beeches
coming
to
a
rise
it
was
cut
through
the
ridge
and
embanked
again
below
it
went
straight
through
the
big
village
or
little
town
of
royston
where
it
crossed
ermine
street
and
took
the
name
of
baldock
street
from
the
town
ahead
as
it
was
market
day
everyone
was
driving
out
of
royston
with
his
trap
full
of
chickens
and
parcels
of
all
kinds
not
to
speak
of
wife
and
children
this
was
my
first
real
chance
of
a
lift
for
between
ickleton
and
the
royston
road
only
farm
waggons
went
and
they
were
all
in
the
hayfields
and
only
travelled
the
road
from
newmarket
all
passing
me
as
if
i
needed
nothing
but
more
dust
to
fill
eyes
mouth
nose
ears
shoes
and
spirit
i
have
never
been
offered
a
lift
by
a
stranger
in
a
but
friends
of
mine
have
told
me
they
have
heard
of
others
who
have
with
the
increase
of
dust
and
heat
the
likelihood
of
a
merciful
motorist
becomes
less
because
dust
and
heat
do
not
produce
the
appearance
desirable
in
a
motorist
s
companion
in
fact
by
the
end
of
the
day
or
of
the
week
especially
if
he
has
forgotten
to
shave
or
has
always
arrived
in
a
town
after
the
wayfarer
runs
the
risk
of
being
called
mate
by
the
baker
s
man
who
refuses
to
let
him
ride
mate
sounds
like
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
but
it
can
really
be
contemptuous
pity
it
is
no
better
than
my
man
from
a
gentleman
or
unfortunate
sister
from
a
lady
or
my
friend
from
a
nonconformist
minister
in
london
it
may
be
different
and
i
should
say
that
a
navvy
would
use
it
in
a
friendly
manner
but
from
the
wallingford
baker
s
man
on
a
country
round
it
means
poor
perhaps
even
dirty
by
this
time
essays
on
walking
and
walking
tours
begin
to
wear
very
thin
you
pitch
stevenson
at
any
rate
over
the
hedge
and
can
not
find
a
place
suitable
for
and
borrow
is
safe
but
then
he
got
really
tired
and
did
not
regard
walking
as
an
amusement
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
had
learned
to
stick
out
his
at
the
end
of
some
of
his
marches
nevertheless
stumping
along
on
a
shoeful
of
blisters
is
not
bad
when
you
are
out
of
royston
and
have
pen
hills
upon
your
left
low
insignificant
restful
stretches
upon
your
right
and
odsey
before
you
in
the
cool
of
evening
for
some
distance
there
was
no
hedge
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
beyond
the
town
and
the
turf
marked
for
many
yards
with
tracks
made
before
metalling
rose
up
to
considerable
swells
of
chalk
cloven
sometimes
gently
and
sometimes
abruptly
into
coombes
some
smooth
as
lawns
some
beautiful
with
trees
tumuli
were
scattered
over
this
smoothest
sward
and
down
from
the
ridge
of
the
high
land
came
deep
curving
trackways
at
odsey
beyond
they
have
found
with
samian
pottery
the
shin
bones
of
men
who
ran
instead
of
walking
people
were
walking
for
pleasure
on
the
grass
up
above
and
children
were
laughing
somewhere
near
but
out
of
sight
it
was
one
of
those
delicious
cool
ends
to
perfect
days
which
give
a
man
the
feeling
of
having
accomplished
something
but
by
no
means
compel
him
to
inquire
what
the
road
still
possessed
the
hills
even
when
it
was
enclosed
on
both
sides
for
it
kept
broad
margins
the
hedges
were
low
between
it
and
the
grass
or
corn
land
and
it
mounted
higher
and
higher
they
were
the
gentlest
of
chalk
hills
crested
with
trees
thrift
hill
gallows
hill
crouch
hill
pott
s
hill
rain
hill
wheat
hill
windmill
hill
and
weston
hills
and
at
their
highest
points
there
were
villages
like
therfield
kelshall
sandon
wallington
clothall
weston
i
had
still
four
or
five
miles
to
walk
at
the
feet
of
these
hills
through
a
silence
undisturbed
by
the
few
market
carts
at
long
intervals
i
am
glad
now
that
i
walked
them
it
seems
to
me
now
that
my
purely
physical
discomfort
intensified
the
taste
of
the
evening
s
beauty
as
it
certainly
made
sweeter
the
perfection
of
enjoyment
which
i
imagine
possible
at
such
an
hour
and
in
such
a
place
the
road
was
serpentining
very
little
but
enough
to
conceal
from
me
for
a
long
time
the
chief
wayside
marks
ahead
as
well
as
my
destination
i
could
always
see
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
me
and
there
the
white
ribbon
disappeared
among
trees
and
this
was
agreeable
in
itself
and
always
suggesting
something
better
beyond
though
itself
a
sufficient
end
if
need
were
moreover
i
was
looking
out
for
a
house
which
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
described
a
came
sloping
down
from
the
far
sky
with
fewer
and
fewer
wing
strokes
and
longer
and
longer
glidings
upon
wings
as
it
drew
near
its
home
tree
it
disappeared
another
flew
in
sight
and
slanted
downward
with
the
same
motion
and
then
another
the
air
was
silent
and
still
the
road
was
empty
the
birds
coming
home
to
the
quiet
earth
seemed
visitors
from
another
world
they
seemed
to
bring
something
out
of
the
sky
down
to
this
world
and
the
house
and
garden
where
i
stayed
at
last
were
full
of
this
something
i
heard
rooks
among
the
tall
beeches
of
just
such
a
house
as
i
knew
i
ought
to
have
been
able
to
imagine
with
the
help
of
the
long
white
road
and
the
gentle
hills
the
tall
trees
the
rooks
and
the
evening
there
were
flowers
and
lawns
beeches
and
sycamores
belonging
to
three
centuries
perhaps
more
and
stately
but
plain
red
brick
of
the
same
date
and
likely
to
endure
for
a
yet
longer
period
if
not
by
its
own
soundness
then
by
its
hold
upon
the
fantasy
of
men
who
build
nothing
like
it
chapter
v
third
day
odsey
to
edlesborough
by
baldock
letchworth
ickleford
leagrave
and
dunstable
the
rooks
had
been
talking
in
my
sleep
much
too
long
before
i
started
next
day
their
voices
and
the
blazing
described
the
morning
for
me
before
i
stirred
i
could
see
and
feel
it
all
and
if
i
could
write
it
down
as
i
saw
and
felt
it
this
would
be
a
good
book
and
no
mistake
the
long
grasses
were
dewy
cool
the
trees
lightly
rustling
and
full
of
shadow
the
sky
of
so
soft
a
greyness
that
it
seemed
an
impossible
palace
for
a
sun
so
gorgeous
the
thrushes
sang
and
seeing
a
perfect
crimson
strawberry
i
picked
it
and
found
that
it
was
as
hot
as
a
strawberry
can
be
and
therefore
at
its
sweetest
and
richest
illustration
deadman
s
lane
baldock
winding
a
little
more
than
before
and
still
closely
attended
on
its
right
by
the
great
northern
railway
the
road
entered
baldock
or
rather
it
approached
that
town
and
then
refusing
to
be
a
main
road
any
longer
turned
off
before
the
toll
bar
inn
to
the
right
thus
it
dipped
into
the
northern
edge
of
the
town
close
to
the
railway
and
the
station
as
a
long
sordid
lane
called
bygrave
lane
or
deadman
s
lane
past
the
gasworks
past
the
stag
the
swan
and
the
black
eagle
in
a
row
this
was
the
abode
of
the
sand
boys
who
sold
sand
all
over
the
country
and
bought
bones
and
rabbit
skins
it
is
also
the
reputed
scene
of
the
death
of
gypsy
smith
s
wife
and
his
own
conversion
past
the
nobly
named
the
narrow
street
became
a
lane
rutted
and
half
green
and
edged
on
the
left
with
nettles
of
wondrous
height
and
density
the
railway
was
closer
and
closer
on
the
right
on
the
left
was
a
new
cemetery
behind
tall
railings
at
length
the
railway
passed
under
the
road
i
was
now
again
between
high
extravagant
hedges
of
thorn
and
wild
roses
the
road
was
wider
but
rough
half
green
and
half
rutted
and
in
places
divided
into
two
by
a
thicket
of
blackthorn
standing
in
the
midst
a
nightingale
was
singing
among
the
roses
above
some
old
chalk
pits
after
a
road
from
a
level
crossing
had
come
in
on
the
left
i
kept
straight
on
along
the
right
side
of
a
hedge
dividing
the
railway
from
a
big
field
and
past
the
left
edge
of
a
shallow
chalk
pit
there
was
no
road
here
but
several
tracks
went
through
the
long
grass
and
mistake
was
impossible
on
the
right
two
paths
went
off
to
some
of
the
new
houses
of
the
letchworth
garden
city
and
to
a
building
gigantically
labelled
this
was
i
suppose
the
temple
of
this
city
s
god
though
the
name
except
as
the
welsh
equivalent
for
arthur
was
unknown
to
me
they
say
now
that
arthur
was
a
solar
hero
and
when
in
doubt
men
might
do
worse
than
to
worship
the
sun
if
they
could
discover
how
at
letchworth
they
were
endeavouring
to
do
so
the
sun
was
not
benign
or
even
merciful
in
return
for
these
efforts
he
responded
by
telling
the
truth
with
his
most
brilliant
beams
so
that
the
city
resembled
a
caravan
of
bathing
machines
except
that
there
was
no
sea
and
the
machines
could
not
conveniently
be
moved
at
the
end
of
the
big
field
i
crossed
a
new
road
and
entered
among
the
elders
and
thorn
trees
of
the
edge
of
norton
common
here
there
were
several
parallel
paths
and
on
the
left
behind
a
hedge
was
a
street
called
icknield
this
represented
the
line
of
the
road
but
whether
this
or
the
path
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
was
more
on
the
old
course
i
can
not
say
past
the
houses
icknield
way
ceased
to
be
a
road
fit
for
perambulators
and
became
a
rough
track
chiefly
used
for
carrying
building
materials
it
followed
along
a
hedge
and
past
a
sand
pit
in
one
place
a
little
hollowed
out
it
was
miserable
with
the
rank
grass
of
newly
developed
districts
after
a
road
came
in
from
under
the
railway
on
the
left
it
began
to
curve
away
north
and
leave
the
railway
once
more
it
was
between
hedges
but
with
all
its
vicissitudes
it
had
remained
a
parish
boundary
all
the
way
from
slip
inn
hill
near
odsey
it
was
going
uphill
and
presently
i
could
see
not
only
the
corn
sainfoin
and
houses
growing
round
about
but
in
the
the
line
of
hedged
and
wooded
hills
above
ippollitts
offley
and
pirton
letchworth
was
still
in
sight
like
so
many
wounds
on
the
earth
and
so
much
but
though
behind
me
it
was
fascinating
like
all
these
raw
settlements
it
is
a
curious
pleasure
to
see
them
besieged
by
docks
and
nettles
and
as
sometimes
happens
quietly
overcome
by
docks
and
nettles
they
look
new
until
suddenly
they
are
unvenerably
old
letchworth
may
turn
out
to
be
an
exception
but
as
i
hurried
through
it
some
back
gardens
some
forlorn
new
roads
and
the
tune
of
she
s
off
with
the
gipsies
oh
sent
my
thoughts
mysteriously
but
irresistibly
to
the
desolate
settlements
i
have
known

the

ickleford
church
at
the
the
road
made
westward
a
shady
hedge
on
the
left
sunny
sainfoin
on
the
right
and
arrived
at
wilbury
camp
the
north
side
of
the
camp
touched
the
bedfordshire
border
the
high
irregular
earth
walls
overgrown
with
thorn
trees
made
an
uneven
and
much
delved
enclosure
where
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
gravel
pit
from
camp
and
through
this
hollow
and
among
its
thorns
went
the
path
i
took
instead
of
along
the
southern
hedge
and
wall
which
appears
to
be
the
canonical
icknield
way
and
the
parish
boundary
across
it
goes
the
hard
road
coming
from
brook
end
over
wilbury
hill
and
down
to
walsworth
on
the
other
side
of
this
road
it
was
a
wide
green
way
winding
through
open
cornland
down
to
the
trees
of
ickleford
and
on
its
left
at
the
convenient
distance
of
two
miles
the
tower
and
roof
clusters
and
trees
of
hitchin
replaced
the
spots
of
letchworth
there
were
hedges
with
elms
for
the
mowers
to
rest
under
and
on
the
right
was
the
white
wall
of
a
chalk
pit
with
roses
and
privet
overhanging
and
black
bryony
and
elder
growing
below
the
way
descended
to
be
crossed
by
two
lines
of
railway
a
few
yards
apart
between
the
two
it
was
grassy
and
beyond
the
second
the
road
forded
the
river
hiz
and
even
waded
in
it
for
thirty
yards
or
so
ickleford
village
had
a
green
with
chestnut
trees
a
green
man
and
an
old
george
and
a
church
wall
decorated
regularly
all
over
with
an
incised
design
of
saws
swords
handcuffs
crowns
etc
the
road
passed
catherine
s
church
and
the
green
man
on
its
right
and
went
out
of
ickleford
at
ickleford
gate
on
the
hitchin
road
this
it
crossed
and
went
against
the
course
of
the
river
oughton
which
flowed
and
turned
a
mill
a
little
below
upon
the
left
at
first
it
was
a
road
of
good
surface
with
hedges
and
telegraph
posts
making
for
the
downs
for
telegraph
hill
deacon
hill
and
tingley
wood
between
pirton
and
lilley
but
at
the
mill
its
modern
use
gone
the
road
was
once
more
a
broad
green
way
dipping
with
many
ruts
down
among
the
willowy
buttercup
meads
of
the
oughton
doves
cooed
blackcaps
poured
out
their
cool
fiery
wine
of
melody
and
the
cattle
meditated
about
nothing
under
the
elms
the
road
was
rising
again
crossed
the
pirton
and
hitchin
road
at
punch
s
cross
and
entered
through
the
gate
of
an
travelling
along
its
hedge
and
out
by
another
gate
at
punch
s
cross
it
became
a
parish
boundary
which
it
ceased
to
be
at
the
river
hiz
up
on
the
right
above
the
ploughland
lay
tingley
wood
and
a
beech
clump
on
the
left
charlock
and
corn
divided
by
elms
and
hedges
extended
to
a
wall
of
low
wooded
hills
out
of
the
field
the
way
was
a
lane
entered
under
the
rustling
welcome
of
beech
trees
then
it
became
part
of
the
main
road
from
to
hitchin
and
at
the
turning
southward
to
offley
a
boundary
between
bedfordshire
and
hertfordshire
this
part
of
the
road
was
partly
on
a
terrace
along
the
side
of
a
hill
sloping
to
the
south
and
there
were
roses
and
traveller
s
joy
buds
in
the
hedges
at
one
point
the
land
on
the
left
had
apparently
been
too
steep
to
enclose
at
its
lower
side
and
the
hedge
was
at
the
top
of
this
steep
portion
which
was
therefore
a
broad
rough
triangle
of
open
turf
beside
the
road
beyond
this
the
way
had
good
grass
banks
or
level
margins
with
hazel
and
thorn
hedges
and
ash
or
elm
trees
above
them
it
was
drawing
near
to
a
rough
and
thorny
chalk
hill
called
deacon
hill
and
as
it
was
bent
on
climbing
over
this
range
the
modern
road
left
it
and
going
westward
avoided
the
heights
above
three
hundred
feet
the
icknield
way
took
a
course
and
mounted
steeply
up
as
a
green
almost
rutless
lane
between
high
hedges
it
was
green
and
even
as
soon
as
it
left
the
hard
road
and
now
for
the
first
time
made
a
real
bold
ascent
of
the
chalk
it
looked
more
like
a
part
of
the
ridgeway
but
for
the
high
hedges
than
the
unadventurous
road
that
i
travelled
from
thetford
there
were
daisies
all
over
it
and
roses
hung
upon
either
side
nearing
the
it
narrowed
and
had
steep
banks
on
the
left
with
brambles
and
thorns
over
them
but
right
to
the
top
it
kept
those
high
hedges
below
on
the
right
lay
a
neat
vale
and
a
long
gentle
slope
covered
with
woods
or
horizontal
lines
of
trees
up
to
a
straight
low
ridge
telegraph
hill
which
the
road
crossed
is
over
six
hundred
feet
high
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
it
should
make
this
climb
instead
of
circumventing
the
hill
by
a
sharp
curve
southward
it
never
again
does
such
a
thing
or
rises
to
such
an
altitude
at
the
summit
a
green
ridgeway
leaves
it
it
was
easy
to
glide
into
this
and
wind
with
it
to
lilley
hoo
and
lilley
the
track
was
a
hedgeless
green
band
among
thistles
and
isolated
thorns
glittering
dark
hollies
and
ash
trees
here
and
there
the
sheep
rested
in
the
shade
of
a
little
bramble
and
thorn
thicket
where
an
oak
or
ash
buried
its
trunk
and
roses
climbed
the
clear
high
tinkling
of
the
bells
on
still
wandering
sheep
was
almost
as
gay
as
if
the
bells
were
on
dancers
feet
the
turf
on
the
track
was
the
finest
and
was
bounded
by
a
tussocky
line
on
one
side
if
not
both
and
so
it
serpentined
on
the
high
flat
back
of
the
hills
always
among
old
isolated
thorns
or
small
thickets
illustration
on
telegraph
hill
but
this
was
not
the
icknield
way
which
went
straight
over
telegraph
hill
and
steeply
and
deeply
worn
down
to
a
green
lane
on
the
other
side
where
it
was
joined
on
the
left
by
another
track
descending
from
a
little
tumulus
with
two
thorns
on
it
the
green
lane
winding
was
broad
but
the
spread
of
the
beeches
on
its
left
side
was
broader
and
roofed
it
wholly
the
turf
was
better
when
this
line
of
trees
came
to
an
end
suddenly
a
chalk
pit
on
the
left
narrowed
it
and
this
narrowness
had
been
continued
on
and
used
for
wheat
as
far
as
the
next
turning
thenceforward
it
widened
and
had
rough
hedges
of
elder
and
nettles
holly
and
ash
between
it
and
the
undulating
corn
in
front
bulked
the
smooth
ridge
of
galley
hill
past
the
turning
to
offley
there
were
four
or
five
tracks
parallel
but
on
different
levels
with
an
embanked
one
in
the
centre
soon
it
was
again
on
the
turf
of
the
downs
curving
around
the
right
base
of
galley
hill
the
open
land
on
the
left
hedges
and
fields
on
the
right
past
the
hill
there
were
two
hedges
and
ploughed
land
on
either
hand
hereby
was
the
entrance
into
bedfordshire
then
it
came
almost
at
right
angles
to
the
straight
mound
of
dray
s
ditches
but
turned
to
the
right
along
it
followed
by
the
parish
boundary
into
the
luton
and
bedford
road
if
instead
of
going
alongside
the
ditches
i
had
gone
straight
ahead
upon
the
line
of
the
way
i
should
have
struck
this
road
at
the
sixteenth
milestone
and
at
the
opposite
turning
to
leagrave
which
i
actually
took
the
boundary
on
the
other
hand
went
on
over
the
main
road
towards
houghton
the
road
down
to
leagrave
was
an
ordinary
hedged
road
with
narrow
green
edges
after
passing
a
little
copse
on
the
left
i
turned
on
the
same
side
by
an
ash
a
century
old
into
a
broad
green
track
to
limbury
it
had
hedges
but
that
on
the
left
strayed
away
round
a
huge
rushy
space
beyond
this
was
the
clean
orange
wall
of
a
sand
pit
and
then
a
green
field
and
then
the
and
the
crowd
of
roofs
and
the
tall
chimneys
of
luton
and
in
the
midst
a
tower
above
all
the
rest
but
the
hedge
returned
and
the
way
narrowed
and
it
had
to
cross
leagrave
marsh
and
the
tiny
lea
there
was
a
choice
of
road
or
path
entering
the
slated
cages
of
combined
limbury
and
leagrave
marsh
i
turned
to
the
right
along
limbury
road
and
found
on
my
left
the
icknield
way
giving
its
name
to
an
estate
and
a
new
street
leagrave
marsh
was
evidently
a
pleasant
little
ford
village
before
it
became
what
it
now
seems
to
be
a
for
luton
the
harsh
new
streets
led
me
to
a
rushy
common
threaded
by
the
lea
and
bounded
on
my
side
by
a
road
that
crossed
the
stream
with
a
bridge
at
one
side
of
the
bridge
the
three
horse
shoes
faced
over
the
common
and
along
the
water
ponies
traps
and
dogs
were
clustered
at
the
door
in
the
sun
their
owners
were
either
inside
getting
hot
or
lying
on
the
grass
over
the
way
but
one
driver
was
taking
his
horse
and
trap
through
the
stream
close
to
the
bridge
and
the
whipped
foam
was
shining
and
the
spokes
flashing
some
boys
were
paddling
a
little
way
above
and
above
them
the
village
geese
were
nibbling
among
the
rush
tufts
in
and
out
among
horses
and
traps
men
dogs
boys
and
geese
the
martins
were
flying
the
icknield
way
went
between
the
new
houses
and
across
the
midland
railway
and
so
down
a
field
for
building
into
oak
road
which
leads
from
old
leagrave
into
the
luton
and
dunstable
road
this
road
interrupted
my
way
which
went
formerly
as
a
footpath
straight
across
it
and
into
the
main
road
a
little
west
of
the
house
between
dunstable
and
luton
this
path
was
ploughed
up
and
its
course
only
in
part
noticeable
among
the
crops
the
luton
and
dunstable
road
now
looked
like
a
river
and
the
footpath
a
tiny
brooklet
whose
drying
up
made
no
difference
to
the
main
stream
but
in
robert
morden
s
map
of
the
icnal
way
is
a
clear
good
road
past
leagrave
and
into
dunstable
while
the
road
to
that
town
from
luton
is
parallel
with
the
icnal
way
and
apparently
the
same
as
the
road
and
footpath
running
half
a
mile
south
of
the
present
road
and
just
south
of
the
hatfield
luton
and
dunstable
branch
of
the
great
northern
line
this
main
road
was
a
substantial
broad
straightforward
highway
running
along
level
ground
and
parallel
to
the
downs
on
its
left
there
were
a
few
beeches
in
its
low
hedges
and
the
margins
of
grass
were
of
the
ordinary
width
and
rich
in
dust
three
or
four
miles
of
the
clear
hills
here
and
there
crowned
by
trees
curved
alongside
and
then
slightly
across
my
course
opposite
the
turning
to
houghton
the
lime
works
of
blow
s
down
broke
the
green
wall
with
white
illustration
dunstable
downs
as
i
entered
dunstable
there
was
already
a
touch
of
night
in
the
light
and
it
fell
with
a
sad
blessing
upon
the
church
and
the
sheep
grazing
in
the
churchyard
up
above
the
road
on
my
left
the
crossing
of
the
icknield
way
and
watling
street
makes
dunstable
watling
street
was
wider
and
had
the
town
hall
the
post
office
the
bigger
shops
and
the
chief
inns
the
icknield
way
known
first
as
church
street
then
as
west
street
was
the
more
rustic
humble
and
informal
and
beyond
the
crossing
it
had
trees
by
its
side
and
this
seemed
natural
and
just
it
had
become
thoroughly
suburban
before
leaving
the
town
and
coming
to
the
smooth
high
downs
on
the
left
where
children
were
playing
and
girls
walking
about
above
a
field
of
barley
and
charlock
beside
the
road
on
my
right
there
was
a
wide
border
of
level
down
turf
and
no
hedge
between
it
and
the
corn
the
downs
or
i
should
say
the
chiltern
hills
proceeded
majestically
southward
but
six
or
seven
miles
away
advanced
somewhat
to
the
east
half
clothed
in
woods
until
the
bare
beacon
hill
stopped
steep
and
abrupt
above
a
high
plateau
of
cornland
which
fell
away
into
a
broad
wooded
lowland
on
my
right
round
this
beacon
i
could
see
that
my
road
would
bend
i
thought
i
could
see
the
ledge
it
must
follow
in
that
lower
land
on
my
right
there
were
several
rises
such
was
the
smooth
easy
sweep
of
toternhoe
close
to
luton
such
the
wooded
heave
upon
which
rose
the
dark
noble
tower
of
edlesborough
church
and
such
the
terraced
hill
near
edlesborough
with
a
few
thorns
on
the
slopes
between
the
terraces
and
at
its
foot
a
long
neat
orchard
of
late
plums
or
the
broad
wayside
strip
on
the
right
hand
sometimes
showed
the
old
course
of
my
way
much
below
the
level
of
the
present
road
and
after
well
head
this
lower
course
was
beyond
and
below
the
modern
hedge
on
the
left
at
well
head
i
noticed
a
little
hill
on
this
side
of
the
main
ridge
very
prettily
terraced
with
thorns
on
the
slopes
between
the
terraces
at
well
head
a
deep
cleft
winds
away
to
dolittle
mill
with
the
first
waters
of
the
ouse
a
similar
cleft
a
mile
or
so
beyond
at
the
cross
waters
close
to
the
entrance
into
buckinghamshire
carries
water
to
the
mills
of
eaton
bray
as
i
came
out
of
dunstable
i
thought
there
could
be
nothing
there
equal
to
the
sweep
of
the
downs
before
me
ending
in
the
wooded
ivinghoe
hills
and
the
beacon
but
when
i
had
gone
more
than
towards
the
end
of
the
sweep
i
looked
back
and
saw
that
the
downs
behind
me
were
equal
to
those
i
was
approaching
and
even
advanced
a
little
out
of
the
straight
like
the
others
ending
also
in
a
promontory
above
dunstable
the
air
was
now
still
and
the
earth
growing
dark
and
already
very
quiet
but
the
sky
was
light
and
its
clouds
of
utmost
whiteness
were
very
wildly
and
even
fiercely
shaped
so
that
it
seemed
the
playground
of
powerful
and
wanton
spirits
knowing
nothing
of
earth
and
this
dark
earth
appeared
a
small
though
also
a
kingly
and
brave
place
in
comparison
with
the
infinite
heavens
now
so
joyous
and
so
bright
and
out
of
reach
i
was
glad
to
be
there
but
i
fell
in
with
a
philosopher
who
seemed
to
be
equally
moved
yet
could
not
decide
whether
his
condition
was
to
be
described
as
happiness
or
melancholy
he
talked
about
himself
he
was
a
lean
indefinite
man
half
his
life
lay
behind
him
like
a
corpse
so
he
said
and
half
was
before
him
like
a
ghost
he
told
me
of
just
such
another
evening
as
this
and
just
such
another
doubt
as
to
whether
it
was
to
be
put
down
to
the
account
of
happiness
or
melancholy
he
said
that
he
had
been
digging
all
day
in
a
heavy
soil
often
jarring
the
fork
against
immovable
flints
lifting
more
often
than
not
a
weight
of
clay
only
just
short
of
the
limit
of
his
strength
he
had
thought
and
thought
until
his
brain
could
do
nothing
but
remain
aware
of
dull
misery
and
the
violent
shocks
of
the
hard
work
but
his
eyes
saw
the
sun
go
down
with
a
brief
pomp
of
crimson
soon
covered
up
by
funereal
drifts
and
these
in
their
turn
give
way
to
a
soft
blue
full
of
whitest
stars
and
without
one
cloud
they
saw
the
far
hills
once
more
take
on
their
night
look
of
serene
and
desolate
vastness
and
felt
the
meadows
of
the
valley
become
dark
and
uncertain
the
woods
much
duller
but
distinct
the
woods
immediately
below
him
on
the
thickened
and
appeared
more
wild
and
impossible
the
road
winding
up
between
them
like
a
long
curl
of
smoke
was
wholly
concealed
slowly
the
solid
world
was
whittled
away
the
lights
of
the
small
town
across
the
valley
towards
the
hills
came
out
illustration
beacon
hill
ivinghoe
as
an
owl
in
the
woods
announced
the
triumph
of
night
with
one
large
clear
note
he
straightened
himself
slowly
and
painfully
among
the
clods
it
would
have
been
easier
to
continue
his
toil
than
to
do
this
but
he
did
it
and
then
cleaned
the
prongs
of
his
upright
fork
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
prolonging
the
action
as
if
he
either
hoped
to
arrive
now
at
some
significant
conclusion
with
its
help
or
feared
the
next
step
that
had
to
be
taken
when
he
could
no
longer
clean
the
prongs
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
out
beyond
the
woods
over
the
valley
to
the
far
hills
the
quiet
the
magnitude
of
space
the
noble
lines
of
the
range
a
little
strengthened
his
spirit
he
remained
still
the
surface
of
his
hands
was
dry
to
brittleness
he
was
stiff
and
yet
unsatisfied
with
the
result
of
his
labour
he
felt
the
dulness
of
his
eyes
and
no
thing
or
person
in
the
world
or
out
of
it
came
into
his
mind
with
any
conscious
delight
or
quickness
yet
he
still
looked
along
the
ridges
of
the
hills
from
one
end
to
the
other
from
star
to
star
without
a
thought
save
the
sleeping
underlying
one
that
he
was
growing
old
a
climbed
nervously
up
the
invisible
the
lamps
of
it
darting
across
a
hundred
little
spaces
between
one
tree
and
another
of
the
vague
woods
it
left
the
silence
stronger
than
ever
the
man
leaned
with
his
chest
upon
his
hands
which
were
upon
the
handle
of
his
fork
only
a
few
years
ago
either
three
or
four
he
could
not
have
ascertained
by
any
searching
of
memory
he
had
been
young
and
treated
with
contempt
or
with
pitiful
kindness
by
those
of
more
years
but
now
he
had
come
by
unknown
ways
to
feel
that
he
differed
from
mature
men
not
by
anything
positive
that
could
be
called
youth
but
only
by
some
undefinable
lack
which
condemned
him
to
a
kind
of
overblown
immaturity
thus
when
he
consciously
or
unconsciously
demanded
a
concession
such
as
might
be
due
to
youth
for
some
act
or
attitude
he
met
in
the
individual
or
in
society
in
some
corporate
form
or
other
a
blankness
or
positive
severity
at
which
he
recoiled
with
open
but
as
yet
uncertainly
comprehending
eyes
of
young
men
he
was
now
sometimes
jealous
of
men
afraid
and
no
longer
defiant
towards
the
contemporaries
with
whom
he
had
shared
thought
and
experience
for
some
years
he
felt
jealousy
if
he
seemed
to
have
outstripped
them
in
the
unwilling
race
fear
if
it
was
himself
that
lagged
and
towards
only
one
or
two
a
fair
and
easy
freedom
and
that
only
intermittently
therefore
no
more
destitute
and
solitary
man
looked
that
night
on
the
stars
yet
they
were
as
bright
and
the
hills
under
them
as
noble
as
those
we
saw
on
the
road
from
dunstable
suddenly
he
awakened
and
thrilled
to
the
sound
of
a
woman
s
voice
singing
alone
somewhere
away
from
where
he
stood
he
forgot
who
and
where
he
was
he
was
no
longer
weary
and
muddied
by
thoughts
his
imagination
went
out
of
him
and
grasped
each
note
simply
and
boldly
where
there
had
been
nothing
there
the
liquid
voice
mounted
in
its
beautiful
unseen
form
amidst
the
darkness
the
singer
was
among
the
dark
trees
probably
in
the
climbing
road
to
one
side
of
him
the
curve
of
that
ascent
always
a
thing
of
simplicity
and
nobleness
was
now
glorious
romantic
as
it
soared
out
of
the
valley
to
the
clear
heights
either
the
singer
was
walking
slowly
up
or
she
was
riding
but
no
footfall
or
turn
of
wheel
was
to
be
heard
it
was
a
powerful
voice
confident
and
without
care
it
leapt
up
with
a
wild
indolent
flight
for
one
short
verse
of
indistinguishable
words
in
a
melody
exulting
in
the
wildness
of
love
and
pride
of
youth
and
then
fell
upon
silence
that
silence
bore
its
part
also
but
the
listener
had
no
sooner
lost
the
first
joy
over
the
insurrection
of
melody
begun
to
consider
whilst
waiting
breathless
for
its
return
who
she
might
be
what
she
was
doing
now
whether
a
lover
was
walking
beside
her
when
she
sang
again
higher
up
the
road
the
first
note
rose
up
to
the
highest
stars
clear
and
fresh
and
having
a
power
like
light
over
the
gloom
other
notes
hovered
after
it
at
the
same
height
and
then
with
one
swoop
as
of
an
eagle
fell
to
the
earth
and
silence
before
even
a
verse
was
finished
a
low
laugh
drawn
out
very
long
an
instant
afterwards
confirmed
the
first
impression
of
the
singer
s
ease
and
joyousness
the
man
could
see
her
neck
lifted
eagerly
and
her
eyes
flashing
towards
the
lover
or
towards
the
stars
her
lips
parted
her
breast
heaving
with
deep
draughts
of
the
night
and
passion
her
feet
pacing
with
languid
strength
he
himself
stood
still
as
any
tree
in
the
ebb
of
the
wind
oh
for
a
horse
to
ride
furiously
for
a
ship
to
sail
for
the
wings
of
an
eagle
for
the
lance
of
a
warrior
or
a
standard
streaming
to
conquest
for
a
man
s
strength
to
dare
and
endure
for
a
woman
s
beauty
to
surrender
for
a
singer
s
fountain
of
precious
tones
for
a
poet
s
pen
he
trembled
and
listened
the
silence
was
unbroken
not
a
footstep
or
whisper
was
to
be
extracted
from
it
by
his
eager
and
praying
ear
he
shivered
in
the
cold
the
last
dead
leaves
shook
upon
the
beeches
but
the
silence
out
there
in
that
world
still
remained
she
was
walking
or
she
was
in
her
lover
s
arms
for
aught
he
knew
no
sound
came
up
to
him
where
he
stood
eager
and
forlorn
until
he
knew
that
she
must
be
gone
away
for
ever
like
his
lyric
desires
and
he
went
into
his
house
and
it
was
dark
and
still
and
inconceivably
empty
as
i
turned
into
the
inn
and
left
him
he
was
inclined
either
to
put
down
that
evening
half
to
happiness
and
half
to
melancholy
or
to
cross
out
one
or
other
of
those
headings
as
being
in
his
case
tautological
the
landlady
at
my
inn
was
the
first
that
ever
told
me
outright
at
once
and
without
being
asked
what
she
charged
for
a
bed
and
as
the
sum
was
reasonable
i
was
doubly
pleased
she
was
a
jaunty
probably
childless
london
woman
not
far
from
forty
who
referred
to
her
husband
as
my
she
had
a
skittish
falsetto
laugh
whether
she
was
talking
to
me
about
their
old
horse
john
and
all
his
merits
or
to
the
labourers
about
such
and
such
a
sweet
old
house
in
the
neighbourhood
they
were
speaking
of
the
coronation
bonfire
that
was
building
on
the
beacon
hill
and
she
became
important
and
full
of
reminiscences
of
the
hampstead
heath
bonfire
and
thereanent
the
spaniards
vale
of
health
and
so
on
she
hovered
between
them
and
me
anxious
to
tell
me
that
much
as
she
liked
a
country
life
she
missed
the
gas
and
the
bathroom
of
a
london
house
now
and
then
she
left
us
all
to
talk
to
the
parrot
in
a
loud
voice
intended
for
mankind
as
well
as
polly
her
sweetheart
turned
out
to
be
a
little
active
man
superficially
jaunty
but
silent
and
brooding
and
hanging
down
his
head
he
was
with
dull
restless
blue
eyes
and
had
not
recently
been
shaved
his
feet
stepped
quickly
hither
and
thither
he
was
dressed
anyhow
and
as
if
he
slept
in
his
clothes
to
ensure
a
fit
a
white
scarf
was
tied
round
his
neck
and
his
trousers
were
turned
up
he
carried
a
cigarette
either
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
or
behind
his
ear
he
was
one
of
those
creatures
provided
by
an
almighty
providence
for
attending
on
that
noble
animal
such
he
called
it
the
horse
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
calling
his
own
horse
john
old
he
never
carried
a
whip
because
he
said
he
did
not
believe
in
hurting
dumb
a
man
who
knows
horses
well
is
equally
at
home
in
town
or
country
and
though
this
man
was
as
a
cockney
as
his
wife
he
was
like
her
contented
with
his
three
or
four
years
of
country
solitude
it
was
he
said
a
happy
life
yes
a
happy
life
better
than
what
we
had
learnt
to
call
the
bustle
and
confusion
of
london
i
asked
him
about
the
icknield
way
which
he
knew
by
that
name
and
he
told
me
that
it
was
a
roman
road
and
that
he
had
heard
a
man
could
walk
on
it
for
twelve
months
and
come
back
to
the
same
place
again
what
that
place
was
he
did
not
say
probably
he
meant
any
place
and
imagined
that
the
road
made
a
circuit
of
this
island
or
belike
of
the
great
globe
itself
there
could
be
no
better
landlord
and
landlady
of
a
small
wayside
inn
with
one
horse
one
trap
and
one
spare
bed
the
bed
was
clean
and
comfortable
and
i
fell
asleep
in
it
while
the
were
piping
on
the
downs
and
a
pair
of
country
wheels
were
rolling
by
late
and
slow
chapter
vi
fourth
day
edlesborough
to
streatley
on
the
upper
icknield
way
by
wendover
kimble
whiteleaf
gipsies
corner
ipsden
and
cleeve
five
o
clock
sir
said
the
cockney
at
my
door
next
morning
and
i
looked
out
to
see
a
hot
day
slowly
and
certainly
preparing
in
mist
and
silence
there
was
nobody
in
the
fields
the
stood
by
the
rick
where
it
had
arrived
too
late
to
be
unloaded
last
night
to
one
bred
in
a
town
this
kind
of
silence
and
solitariness
perhaps
always
remains
impressive
we
see
no
man
no
smoke
and
hear
no
voice
of
man
or
beast
or
machinery
and
straightway
the
mind
recalls
very
early
mornings
when
london
has
lain
silent
but
for
the
cooing
of
pigeons
that
silence
of
so
many
things
that
can
and
will
make
sounds
gives
some
of
its
prestige
to
the
country
silence
of
very
quiet
things
therefore
when
i
have
looked
out
of
a
strange
window
for
the
first
time
and
seen
nothing
move
but
leaves
on
the
earth
and
clouds
in
the
sky
i
have
often
for
a
moment
felt
as
if
it
were
dawn
and
have
slipped
into
a
mood
of
dawn
it
might
be
possible
on
a
cloudy
day
and
in
a
new
country
to
be
deceived
thus
even
at
noon
thus
the
innocence
of
silent
london
is
transferred
to
the
downs
the
woods
the
vacant
fields
and
the
road
without
a
wheel
or
a
foot
upon
it
for
miles
and
miles
i
had
about
forty
miles
to
cover
before
the
end
of
the
daylight
so
i
had
to
help
myself
by
driving
with
my
host
and
his
old
son
john
i
was
now
thoroughly
one
foot
was
particularly
bad
and
in
trying
to
save
it
i
used
different
muscles
in
the
leg
which
were
quickly
tired
then
to
help
myself
i
had
leaned
heavily
on
my
stick
at
every
step
and
so
brought
arm
and
shoulder
to
a
state
of
discomfort
if
not
pain
finally
the
stick
was
unsuitable
for
its
purpose
and
sorely
afflicted
the
palm
of
the
hand
that
grasped
it
i
had
carried
the
stick
for
many
single
days
of
walking
and
liked
it
for
it
was
a
tapered
oak
sapling
cut
in
the
weald
and
virtually
straight
because
its
slightly
spiral
curves
counteracted
one
another
but
it
had
almost
no
handle
and
so
drove
itself
into
one
small
portion
of
the
palm
when
leaned
on
it
had
also
in
the
winter
shown
itself
hard
to
retain
in
the
hand
when
a
few
inches
of
it
were
in
mud
nevertheless
it
was
so
nicely
balanced
and
being
oak
so
likely
to
last
a
lifetime
that
for
six
years
i
put
up
with
its
faults
and
now
having
been
in
my
company
for
so
many
miles
in
a
splendid
june
it
has
a
fresh
hold
upon
me
also
i
am
not
certain
that
any
other
handle
a
larger
and
rounder
knob
or
a
stout
natural
crook
would
have
been
much
better
in
a
hand
not
made
of
iron
perhaps
a
really
long
staff
grasped
some
way
from
its
upper
end
would
be
right
but
there
is
something
too
majestic
patriarchal
even
about
such
a
staff
a
man
would
have
to
build
up
his
life
round
about
it
if
it
had
been
deliberately
adopted
and
gradually
he
would
become
a
celebrity
of
course
if
he
had
an
inclination
towards
such
a
staff
as
the
natural
and
accredited
form
among
pedestrians
there
would
be
an
end
of
the
matter
but
that
is
not
very
likely
in
a
englishman
he
must
meditate
upon
what
might
have
been
and
be
content
to
make
five
shillings
out
of
his
meditation
if
he
is
a
journalist
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drive
with
willcocks
he
became
quite
silent
apart
from
civility
he
evidently
understood
the
horse
and
the
horse
him
in
the
mutual
manner
usually
expected
from
a
legal
monogamous
union
if
he
had
sat
on
the
horse
s
back
the
combination
would
have
been
nothing
like
a
centaur
but
with
one
between
the
shafts
and
the
other
holding
the
reins
they
were
one
spirit
in
two
bodies
as
we
began
to
curve
round
the
foot
of
the
ivinghoe
hills
which
were
on
our
left
we
passed
another
but
larger
deep
cleft
like
those
at
well
head
and
cross
waters
below
the
road
upon
our
right
called
coombe
hole
there
was
another
coombe
a
mile
to
the
south
but
before
this
i
had
not
met
the
name
hardly
the
thing
except
on
the
west
of
royston
since
i
left
thetford
we
went
close
under
the
steep
slope
of
beacon
hill
which
was
tipped
with
a
tumulus
and
scored
upon
its
flanks
by
many
old
descending
trackways
away
to
the
right
there
was
no
land
so
high
as
our
road
about
five
hundred
feet
the
were
half
as
high
again
for
farther
than
eye
could
see
and
to
all
this
low
land
of
dairy
and
garden
the
road
was
a
boundary
we
were
approaching
the
place
where
the
icknield
way
is
said
to
divide
into
two
parallel
courses
a
road
from
leighton
buzzard
strikes
athwart
the
course
and
following
along
this
to
the
left
for
half
a
mile
you
turn
to
the
right
into
the
upper
icknield
way
following
it
to
the
right
you
reach
ivinghoe
and
there
turn
to
the
left
into
the
lower
icknield
we
were
going
to
take
the
upper
so
called
as
being
higher
up
the
slope
of
the
land
just
before
the
leighton
buzzard
road
we
passed
on
our
left
a
long
cleft
smooth
and
with
horses
feeding
in
it
and
hereabouts
the
old
course
or
part
of
its
original
width
was
clear
over
the
hedge
on
our
right
was
a
high
bank
round
which
went
the
road
to
ivinghoe
and
this
bank
would
explain
the
sharp
turn
originally
it
may
well
have
been
that
the
road
forked
the
lower
going
past
the
old
windmill
straight
ahead
and
so
to
pitstone
green
and
missing
ivinghoe
the
upper
going
with
it
to
the
old
windmill
and
there
diverging
to
the
left
past
pitstone
church
and
out
into
the
road
now
marked
upper
icknield
way
at
folly
farm
along
this
road
there
was
a
border
of
close
grass
chestnuts
or
sycamores
of
about
thirty
years
stood
up
here
and
there
in
the
hedge
and
over
it
i
saw
ivinghoe
church
tower
and
the
silly
spire
short
and
sharp
on
top
of
it
the
misty
woods
behind
and
the
protuberance
of
southend
hill
having
its
sides
carved
into
thorny
terraces
linces
or
linchetts
the
pitstone
church
tower
and
an
elm
throned
on
a
rise
together
and
the
broad
wooded
valley
beyond
the
air
was
sweet
now
with
roses
now
with
yellow
bedstraw
larks
sang
and
a
yellowhammer
that
forgot
the
end
of
its
song
and
once
a
blackbird
i
had
left
behind
the
ivinghoe
hills
but
pitstone
hill
their
successor
was
of
the
same
brood
it
was
chiefly
bare
and
its
flanks
as
well
as
scarred
by
a
slanting
trackway
the
land
between
the
foot
of
it
and
the
road
was
carved
with
the
utmost
ingenuity
of
which
chalk
is
capable
once
there
was
a
succession
of
long
parallel
deep
rolls
at
right
angles
to
the
road
wheat
and
barley
grew
on
them
except
in
one
or
two
places
where
the
fall
was
too
steep
and
there
were
thorns
amidst
the
corn
i
saw
also
several
of
those
natural
walls
formed
by
a
sudden
change
of
level
these
are
generally
used
as
divisions
between
fields
here
there
was
wheat
above
and
wheat
below
and
along
the
bottom
of
the
wall
a
cart
track
went
between
lines
of
poppies
up
to
the
hill
another
such
wall
but
higher
had
beeches
on
its
slope
and
it
made
a
fine
curve
up
to
its
end
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
half
a
mile
past
the
turn
to
pitstone
church
the
way
becomes
a
boundary
between
buckinghamshire
and
hertfordshire
as
far
as
the
bridge
over
the
grand
junction
canal
where
i
entered
hertfordshire
again
leaving
it
nearly
two
miles
beyond
and
not
far
from
the
junction
with
akeman
street
at
a
dip
from
tring
wharf
the
road
narrowed
and
lost
its
green
edges
but
regained
them
on
the
more
level
ground
for
a
little
while
after
the
crossing
to
tring
church
a
narrow
green
track
was
raised
on
the
right
above
the
road
and
between
it
and
the
hedge
here
there
was
an
elm
and
there
several
and
here
an
ash
and
there
was
never
no
charlock
the
hills
on
the
left
were
more
and
more
wooded
with
beeches
and
they
curved
round
so
as
to
lie
slightly
across
our
course
on
the
right
lay
the
broad
reservoirs
of
the
canal
at
the
edge
of
the
vale
of
aylesbury
illustration
wendover
now
once
more
the
icknield
way
is
thrown
out
of
its
course
for
a
little
way
this
time
by
akeman
street
a
modern
road
to
aylesbury
the
ancient
road
from
this
region
to
cirencester
which
was
the
junction
for
wales
devon
and
cornwall
it
enters
akeman
street
a
third
of
a
mile
east
of
the
milestone
from
london
the
icknield
way
was
presumably
older
it
was
at
least
old
when
akeman
street
was
romanized
and
came
cutting
in
a
straight
line
across
its
meanders
and
therefore
it
lost
confidence
for
half
a
mile
and
forsook
them
and
took
to
the
roman
straight
line
until
suddenly
stumbling
upon
itself
again
at
one
of
its
meanders
further
on
it
returned
to
its
old
way
the
scene
is
like
the
picture
of
a
wandering
life
interrupted
by
a
year
of
discipline
the
stark
in
line
seem
part
of
the
discipline
possibly
for
years
for
centuries
the
meanders
survived
more
and
more
faintly
with
the
straight
line
enclosing
a
rough
and
crooked
space
this
space
beside
tring
hill
should
have
been
a
common
for
ever
but
either
it
never
was
or
a
common
award
handed
it
over
to
the
largest
mouth
opposite
the
milestone
it
turns
out
from
the
main
road
in
its
old
direction
and
escapes
the
for
some
time
it
was
unlike
its
old
self
because
it
had
hardly
any
grassy
margin
it
went
up
and
down
again
and
again
and
often
steeply
and
the
more
hilly
a
modern
road
the
less
likely
it
is
to
have
wide
margins
near
halton
there
was
a
wayside
border
but
little
if
at
all
trodden
and
not
fed
down
by
sheep
a
traveller
joining
the
road
for
a
mile
or
so
would
have
failed
to
see
in
it
any
distant
or
ancient
purpose
it
was
a
winding
country
lane
metalled
for
modern
uses
and
by
halton
house
made
polite
with
firs
and
laurels
in
one
place
as
we
neared
wendover
i
saw
the
old
course
and
its
bank
and
also
a
hedge
beyond
the
present
one
past
halton
woods
the
hills
recede
southward
and
there
is
a
gap
of
a
mile
between
steep
boddington
hill
and
steep
bacombe
hill
through
this
gap
comes
the
road
from
london
uxbridge
and
amersham
to
aylesbury
and
the
railway
with
it
at
the
entrance
stands
wendover
through
this
long
little
town
of
cottages
the
icknield
way
goes
as
high
street
and
pound
street
we
were
now
close
under
bacombe
hill
with
its
camp
and
barrow
in
front
jutting
out
and
making
the
road
curve
west
before
it
could
resume
its
course
by
a
sharp
turn
south
lay
the
coombe
hill
and
its
obelisk
beacon
hill
sprinkled
with
thorns
and
pulpit
hill
as
we
climbed
the
lower
slopes
of
bacombe
hill
i
noticed
that
the
roadside
green
had
been
dug
up
and
enclosed
by
a
second
hedge
beyond
there
was
a
good
green
margin
now
on
the
left
and
now
on
the
right
and
beeches
rustled
from
the
hedges
and
on
both
sides
grew
corn
the
road
went
up
and
down
coming
thus
suddenly
in
sight
of
ellesborough
church
tower
rising
pale
ahead
out
of
its
trees
against
the
clear
line
of
the
hills
past
butler
s
cross
where
the
road
from
aylesbury
to
hughenden
and
high
wycombe
crosses
the
sycamores
on
the
left
were
beautiful
and
so
were
the
beeches
and
ashes
following
and
then
more
sycamores
and
still
more
in
a
cluster
above
the
high
bank
by
ellesborough
church
the
chekers
park
limes
and
ashes
on
the
left
cooled
the
road
until
we
came
to
a
pool
and
little
kimble
church
then
there
were
more
park
trees
lime
and
elm
and
chestnut
as
we
went
up
to
the
church
tower
of
nicholas

hills
and
down
steep
hills
and
i
took
to
my
feet
again
just
before
the
second
milestone
from
princes
risborough
in
obedience
to
my
map
i
turned
to
the
left
and
took
the
road
at
a
fork
for
a
quarter
mile
this
was
a
narrow
chalky
lane
having
at
its
entrance
a
sycamore
and
a
thatched
cottage
and
traveller
s
joy
all
over
its
low
hedge
but
crossing
a
road
from
great
missenden
it
became
more
important
hard
and
white
with
a
green
border
i
climbed
up
past
the
red
lion
at
whiteleaf
under
whiteleaf
hill
crossed
the
wycombe
road
and
went
down
a
hedged
and
rutty
lane
leaving
the
spire
of
princes
risborough
half
a
mile
below
on
the
right
the
way
was
some
distance
up
on
a
steep
slope
and
itself
in
places
so
steep
from
side
to
side
that
there
were
two
tracks
one
two
yards
above
the
other
then
it
was
a
broad
track
of
level
turf
next
a
narrow
and
rough
one
the
ruts
as
near
the
horsenden
road
mended
with
lemonade
bottles
and
meat
tins
that
road
also
thwarts
the
icknield
way
and
diverts
it
half
a
mile
to
the
left
an
old
course
seemed
perhaps
to
be
indicated
by
a
hedge
continuing
the
line
of
the
lane
behind
turning
to
the
right
out
of
this
road
the
icknield
way
was
white
with
green
edges
of
which
one
presently
became
a
terrace
above
the
road
over
one
railway
and
under
another
its
level
green
edges
were
trimmed
with
in
the
hedges
there
were
elms
past
the
bledlow
road
it
was
a
broad
rough
lane
soon
green
between
hedges
the
chilterns
and
wain
hill
woods
on
the
left
charlock
on
the
right
it
climbed
until
at
the
leather
bottle
it
reached
its
highest
point
since
telegraph
hill
and
it
had
woods
both
above
and
below
which
rarely
happens
to
it
as
it
passed
above
the
head
of
a
coombe
having
an
entrance
apparently
higher
than
its
back
there
were
roses
in
the
hedges
through
these
beech
woods
the
leather
bottle
marked
the
far
edge
of
the
wood
and
the
passing
of
the
border
into
oxfordshire
here
a
steep
track
slanted
down
from
the
the
road
was
now
narrower
confined
by
a
hedge
and
bank
on
the
right
and
the
steep
wall
of
the
thorn
and
juniper
hill
on
the
left
presently
another
deep
track
came
slantwise
down
from
chinnor
hill
towards
bledlow
and
crossed
my
way
beyond
this
the
vale
was
lovely
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
beyond
the
railway
which
followed
it
was
an
irregular
space
of
two
or
three
square
miles
nearly
level
but
not
quite
this
was
divided
into
large
fields
of
grass
or
corn
by
scarce
perceptible
hedges
or
ditches
and
crossed
by
one
winding
road
visible
and
white
at
only
one
of
its
bends
along
this
road
and
the
hedges
a
very
few
elms
were
distributed
with
indescribable
felicity
there
would
be
five
at
a
bend
a
row
then
a
break
and
only
one
or
two
more
and
they
made
only
one
long
line
one
of
the
fields
so
divided
was
with
charlock
on
one
which
was
slightly
tilted
up
a
few
sheep
were
scattered
beyond
and
on
either
side
of
this
space
the
trees
were
thicker
and
closed
in
so
that
two
or
three
miles
away
all
seemed
woodland
with
an
interspace
or
two
then
a
grey
dim
ridge
beyond
all
under
a
sky
above
the
juniper
hill
the
jackdaws
were
jacking
merrily
illustration
near
the
leather
afterwards
the
road
descended
and
was
a
line
with
a
narrow
ploughed
field
between
it
and
the
edge
of
the
juniper
above
chinnor
it
was
for
a
long
way
almost
straight
broad
and
green
with
elms
in
the
left
hedge
here
the
chilterns
had
beeches
on
the
upper
slope
and
dots
of
juniper
below
suddenly
after
this
straightness
the
way
had
to
descend
a
little
over
undulating
ground
and
it
wriggled
ahead
confusedly
narrow
and
without
trees
in
its
hedge
widening
where
a
hump
was
useless
to
the
ploughland
below
in
front
now
stood
the
clumped
beacon
hill
above
lewknor
which
was
the
end
of
a
long
curve
of
hills
carrying
the
woods
of
crowell
kingston
and
aston
woods
reaching
from
the
ridge
down
to
the
arable
in
most
parts
but
with
lawny
or
chalky
intervals
at
the
crossing
to
kingston
blount
the
railway
came
up
to
my
road
and
from
there
went
close
and
parallel
for
a
mile
to
the
station
of
aston
rowant
it
was
here
a
broad
green
track
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
though
still
above
everything
lying
on
its
right
and
leaving
the
villages
at
least
half
a
mile
on
that
side
it
rounded
beacon
hill
which
was
capped
with
a
and
sprinkled
with
junipers
and
went
along
under
bald
hill
and
shirburn
hill
which
was
wooded
before
crossing
the
road
from
great
marlow
and
fingest
to
watlington
it
wound
round
a
chalk
pit
and
rubbish
heap
then
the
joined
it
though
it
was
only
a
green
lane
in
two
terraces
going
under
thorny
watlington
hill
and
past
cornfields
sprinkled
with
charlock
and
white
campion
at
one
point
ten
elm
trees
one
a
triple
tree
stood
out
in
the
middle
of
the
wide
green
trackway
beyond
the
road
from
nettlebed
the
way
was
white
between
high
level
green
banks
and
then
long
grass
thistles
and
thorns
in
a
thicket
before
coming
to
the
pond
where
a
lane
goes
up
on
the
left
under
more
elms
to
dame
alice
farm
then
it
narrowed
and
widened
again
among
nettles
and
elder
and
a
little
farther
it
became
a
company
of
four
parallel
grooves
paved
with
the
pure
down
turf
a
little
and
thyme
the
undulations
of
the
cornland
were
bolder
now
towards
britwell
salome
and
in
a
hollow
a
roof
nestled
among
elms
beyond
these
were
dim
low

a
line
of
elm
trees
now
many
deep
now
in
narrow
file
half
hid
the
village
of
britwell
above
my
road
a
stood
idle
the
men
lay
on
their
faces
under
the
elms
and
beyond
was
their
caravan
crossing
the
britwell
salome
road
i
came
in
sight
of
the
clear
heavings
of
the
sinodun
hills
and
their
clumps
of
trees
and
the
dim
length
of
the
main
downs
far
past
them
britwell
house
looking
at
its
monument
and
swyncombe
downs
lay
a
little
to
the
right
down
the
slope
of
the
hill
at
the
north
edge
of
the
beeches
and

of

came
a
danish
entrenchment
illustration
icknield
way
near
watlington
illustration
sinodun
hill
emerging
from
the
trees
the
road
was
narrow
and
hard
but
sent
a
green
branch
southward
over
littleworth
hill
and
the
adjacent
land
was
equally
high
on
both
sides
on
the
left
ewelme
downs
on
the
right
huntingland
i
went
along
the
south
side
of
ewelme
cow
common
a
shallow
irregular
hollow
of
grass
with
many
thorns
and
much
bird
trefoil
in
it
bounded
on
all
hands
by
roads
without
hedges
i
entered
the
henley
road
a
little
west
of
the
fourteenth
milestone
from
oxford
and
turned
along
it
to
the
right
and
then
almost
at
once
to
the
left
at
gipsies
corner
and
so
went
south
avoiding
the
road
on
the
right
to
crowmarsh
gifford
and
wallingford
here
was
a
new
land
before
me
of
sweeping
corn
big
thatched
barns
on
a
low
ridge
above
it
and
the
main
downs
beyond
it
was
a
narrow
and
road
that
kept
away
from
the
low
elmy
thames
land
on
the
west
over
the
hazels
and
elders
of
its
hedgerows
climbed
roses
and
bryony
between
oakley
wood
and
coldharbour
farm
it
made
southward
crossing
the
nettlebed
and
crowmarsh
and
nuffield
and
crowmarsh
roads
within
a
few
yards
the
three
ways
framing
a
pretty
triangular
waste
of
impenetrable
thorns
elders
and
nettles
sinodun
hills
were
always
distinct
on
the
right
then
i
traversed
grim
s
ditch
where
it
borders
the
south
edge
of
foxberry
wood
and
of
a
broad
herbless
ploughland
the
ditch
being
on
the
south
side
of
the
bank
in
half
a
mile
i
crossed
another
road
from
crowmarsh
going
there
my
way
ceased
to
be
a
road
but
its
line
was
clear
along
the
natural
wall
of
earth
between
upper
and
lower
fields
and
when
there
was
no
more
wall
along
the
strip
of
rough
grass
between
two
stretches
of
ploughland
and
when
that
ended
the
course
of
the
way
was
clearly
on
a
terrace
with
a
central
path
through
the
long
grass
and
some
thorns
on
the
bank
to
the
right
of
it
between
two
fields
of
sainfoin
ahead
on
the
left
stood
the
little
solitary
church
of
ipsden
on
an
road
from
north
stoke
which
i
crossed
onwards
there
was
a
rough
hedgeless
road
still
going
south
after
the
next
to
ipsden
the
probable
line
was
marked
only
by
a
hedge
between
grass
and
arable
and
even
that
gave
out
for
the
last
fifty
yards
before
entering
the
mongewell
road
over
this
road
a
gap
in
the
hedge
might
have
been
used
when
the
road
had
dwindled
to
a
footpath
going
to
glebe
farm
which
is
on
a
road
now
largely
used
to
connect
brazier
s
park
with
goring
i
thought
i
saw
the
ghost
of
it
coming
down
to
glebe
farm
though
amidst
corn
this
road
to
goring
is
henceforward
along
the
course
of
the
icknield
way
it
is
a
hard
and
hedgeless
road
winding
and
undulating
through
corn
that
rises
on
either
hand
to
crested
ridges
it
passed
icknield
farm
crossed
the
south
stoke
and
woodcote
road
and
went
up
as
catsbrain
hill
to
where
i
saw
below
me
the
red
roofs
and
walls
of
suburban
cleeve
and
the
berkshire
downs
their
woods
and
pastures
beyond
the
road
dipped
and
at
the
below
was
lost
in
streets
and
building
land
therefore
i
turned
west
along
the
and
then
south
again
to
goring
the
ford
and
streatley
goring
and
streatley
railway
station
and
the
cutting
and
the
new
houses
have
probably
covered
up
where
they
have
not
destroyed
all
traces
of
the
icknield
way
but
there
is
a
ferry
lane
leading
down
to
the
and
river
to
where
there
was
a
ferry
before
the
bridge
and
a
roman
ford
over
the
gravelly
bottom
before
that
on
the
opposite
side
streatley
vicarage
and
its
lawn
lie
across
the
probable
way
but
beyond
them
a
path
continuing
the
line
of
ferry
lane
goes
straight
up
to
the
reading
road
a
quarter
mile
south
of
the
i
went
into
goring
church
and
churchyard
and
was
pleased
with
the
names
of
john
lammas
and
of
james
ann
and
ruth
thresher
on
tombstones
what
clear
visages
of
men
and
women
these
call
up
each
perfect
in
its
way
shorn
of
the
uncertain
vague
or
incongruous
elements
of
the
living
by
a
kind
of
art
the
mere
names
in
the
churchyard
sketch
the
characters
i
have
seen
mere
names
that
suggested
as
much
as
those
two
beautiful
verses
express
which
walter
de
la
mare
the
author
calls
an
epitaph
here
lies
the
most
beautiful
lady
light
of
step
and
heart
was
she
i
think
she
was
the
most
beautiful
lady
that
ever
dwelt
in
the
west
countrie
but
beauty
vanishes
beauty
passes
however
rare
rare
it
be
and
when
i
crumble
who
will
remember
this
lady
of
the
west
countrie
illustration
near
cleeve
i
have
seen
some
that
had
in
them
no
touch
of
death
except
the
word
and
that
did
no
more
than
make
a
rustle
and
a
shadow
in
the
beauty
as
death
does
in
the
same
poet
s
three
cherry
trees
there
were
three
cherry
trees
once
grew
in
a
garden
all
shady
and
there
for
delight
of
so
gladsome
a
sight
walked
a
most
beautiful
lady
dreamed
a
most
beautiful
lady
birds
in
those
branches
did
sing
blackbird
and
throstle
and
linnet
but
she
walking
there
was
by
far
the
most
fair
lovelier
than
all
else
within
it
blackbird
and
throstle
and
linnet
but
blossoms
to
berries
do
come
all
hanging
on
stalks
light
and
slender
and
one
long
summer
s
day
charmed
that
lady
away
with
vows
sweet
and
merry
and
tender
a
lover
with
voice
low
and
tender
moss
and
lichen
the
green
branches
deck
weeds
nod
in
its
paths
green
and
shady
yet
a
light
footstep
seems
there
to
wander
in
dreams
the
ghost
of
that
beautiful
lady
that
happy
and
beautiful
lady
as
if
i
had
not
had
enough
of
it
in
passing
through
i
walked
out
again
to
cleeve
and
looked
at
the
blocks
of
red
brick
houses
only
people
with
immortal
souls
could
be
content
with
houses
like
those
for
a
man
without
an
immortal
soul
but
a
few
senses
for
a
substitute
a
house
like
one
of
these
is
to
use
one
poor
word
instead
of
a
dozen
better
ones
unsuitable
i
have
lived
in
three
and
one
of
them
would
compete
with
any
house
at
cleeve
for
the
title
of
the
red
brick
house
the
red
brick
house
was
a
raw
naked
building
in
the
county
of
kent
with
a
triple
bay
window
to
left
and
right
of
the
front
door
and
above
these
two
large
windows
and
a
small
one
in
the
middle
on
one
side
there
were
no
windows
on
the
other
only
one
very
small
one
low
down
the
back
was
flat
and
had
a
door
between
a
large
window
and
a
small
and
three
windows
above
the
roof
was
of
slate
and
and
there
was
a
stack
with
three
chimney
pots
at
either
side
of
the
house
and
a
single
chimney
at
the
back
the
house
stood
in
a
level
oblong
piece
of
land
cut
out
of
a
large
field
by
posts
and
wire
and
separated
from
the
road
by
a
cheap
but
rustic
fence
there
were
two
other
buildings
of
the
same
species
within
two
hundred
yards
all
looking
across
the
same
road
between
elm
trees
to
a
ploughed
field
many
hedges
a
rise
of
orchard
land
and
some
heavy
wooded
hills
at
the
horizon
for
the
sake
of
the
houses
the
elms
on
their
side
had
been
felled
and
taken
away
temporary
were
littered
about
two
of
the
gardens
which
someone
had
begun
to
dig
once
upon
a
time
and
even
to
plant
and
sow
but
there
was
not
a
living
tree
in
either
of
them
the
soil
was
light
there
was
no
higher
ground
in
the
near
neighbourhood
and
it
had
therefore
been
chosen
as
the
site
of
a
square
imperfectly
sequestered
among
elms
close
to
the
house
to
the
south
the
view
was
gentle
and
perfect
especially
when
the
blossom
snow
hung
in
the
orchards
and
the
sky
was
milky
soft
above
the
dark
woods
of
the
horizon
at
the
lower
edge
of
these
woods
stood
a
white
house
that
was
always
mysterious
even
though
it
was
often
seen
from
a
gateway
not
a
hundred
yards
distant
the
downs
flowed
to
the
north
eastward
and
westward
the
last
undulations
of
the
downs
could
be
seen
beyond
orchards
and
elms
the
village
clustered
round
a
triangular
green
half
a
mile
away
and
in
the
woods
on
the
slope
from
the
red
brick
house
down
to
the
green
several
bigger
houses
half
hid
themselves
looking
toward
the
far
downs
and
the
orchard
rise
many
other
folds
of
the
land
held
cottages
in
groups
and
their
spreading
dependencies
conical
single
or
sociable
and
not
a
few
churches
yet
from
the
red
brick
house
only
the
white
house
at
the
wood
s
edge
was
visible
when
the
leaves
were
on
the
elms
of
the
hedges
on
the
orchards
and
on
the
oak
and
beech
of
the
copses
and
greater
woods
all
other
houses
that
i
have
known
beautiful
plain
dear
hateful
or
dull
have
been
somehow
subdued
and
made
spiritual
houses
in
course
of
time
and
of
memory
the
red
brick
house
is
the
only
unconquerable
one
to
this
day
it
remains
a
body
and
dead
its
fires
are
black
grates
that
burnt
coal
its
walls
are
in
strips
at
a
certain
price
its
garden
is
still
mere
hard
ground
to
be
dug
and
to
grow
chiefly
the
inexorable
i
saw
a
beautiful
spring
come
into
the
world
from
that
house
spring
passed
down
the
elms
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
led
one
morning
by
a
screaming
loud
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
pewits
came
to
the
ploughed
field
beyond
and
tossed
in
the
sunny
wind
as
i
would
have
done
in
such
days
of
march
had
i
been
a
bird
beautiful
autumn
beautiful
spring
beautiful
summer
triumphed
round
about
that
building
many
days
can
i
remember
from
those
seasons
a
february
day
for
example
a
pale
morning
after
a
night
of
lashing
rain
a
pale
still
morning
the
puddles
the
ruts
of
the
cartways
the
smooth
surface
of
the
winding
roads
glistened
in
the
brown
ploughed
world
the
downs
were
clear
and
dark
and
hard
under
a
blue
sky
and
far
beyond
them
were
the
upper
ridges
of
small
mountainous
clouds
of
a
yellowish
and
sunlit
white
very
sombre
were
the
woods
each
thing
was
dark
or
bright
all
was
fresh
and
cold
suddenly
a
bee
twanged
through
the
air
to
a
snowdrop
on
the
south
side
of
the
red
brick
house
inside
the
house
a
subtle
devil
was
refusing
to
let
a
soul
enter
into
its
walls
a
subtle
but
a
bodiless
and
soulless
devil
negative
and
denying
during
the
nine
years
since
it
was
built
eight
families
had
sojourned
in
the
house
and
had
not
given
it
a
soul
nor
had
the
several
intervals
of
vacancy
given
it
a
ghost
sometimes
death
will
give
a
soul
to
a
house
i
once
saw
the
soul
of
a
dead
man
given
to
a
new
little
house
with
a
verandah
the
swifts
were
racing
to
and
fro
between
the
rows
of
new
houses
they
flew
just
above
the
level
of
men
s
hats
except
when
they
turned
with
a
twist
up
into
the
air
while
they
raced
they
screamed
continually
shrill
screams
of
a
fierce
hilarity
there
were
half
a
hundred
of
them
all
flying
as
upon
the
surface
of
an
invisible
stream
surmounted
by
a
few
black
bobbing
hats
or
very
rarely
an
upturned
white
face
and
no
part
of
the
streets
was
for
more
than
a
second
without
a
crescent
black
wing
and
a
shriek
they
had
taken
possession
of
the
town
under
their
rush
and
cry
the
people
in
the
streets
were
silent
walking
blankly
and
straight
ahead
and
all
looking
old
in
contrast
with
the
tumultuous
and
violent
youth
of
the
birds
the
thought
came
into
my
head
as
i
was
passing
the
last
of
the
houses
that
even
so
must
the
birds
have
been
racing
and
screaming
when
the
danes
harried
this
way
a
thousand
years
ago
and
thus
went
they
over
the
head
of
dante
in
the
streets
of
florence
in
the
warriors
and
in
the
poet
there
was
a
life
clearly
and
mightily
akin
to
that
in
the
bird
s
throat
and
wing
but
here
all
was
grey
all
was
dead
when
i
came
to
the
bridge
leading
over
the
railway
to
the
meadows
i
stood
and
watched
the
birds
flying
beneath
me
above
the
slowly
curving
metals
for
i
could
not
tire
of
the
wings
and
voices
that
ripped
the
dead
air
and
i
crossed
to
the
other
parapet
to
see
how
far
they
went
in
the
opposite
direction
then
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
a
house
built
almost
at
the
edge
of
the
bank
which
fell
steeply
down
to
the
railway
only
the
cutting
separated
it
from
the
town
and
beyond
it
could
be
seen
nothing
but
trees
lining
the
road
and
fields
on
either
side
as
far
as
the
woods
of
the
horizon
it
was
the
last
house
of
the
town
and
one
of
the
newest
not
being
in
a
street
it
needed
not
to
be
exactly
like
the
rest
square
pierced
with
oblong
windows
on
two
sides
and
blank
on
the
other
two
but
so
it
was
except
that
its
lower
windows
looked
across
the
railway
between
the
thin
white
posts
of
a
verandah
a
strip
of
garden
not
more
than
equal
to
it
in
area
surrounded
the
house
and
this
was
enclosed
by
rusty
iron
railings
upon
all
sides
every
window
was
shut
and
the
light
and
air
blocked
out
by
venetian
blinds
painted
grey
the
white
paint
of
the
window
frames
and
the
verandah
was
dirty
but
the
red
bricks
of
the
walls
were
still
harshly
new
and
untouched
by
vegetation
or
any
stain
the
garden
had
never
been
cultivated
it
was
given
over
to
long
grasses
of
the
unhealthy
rankness
peculiar
to
soil
which
is
composed
of
builders
refuse
and
the
stalks
were
matted
and
beaten
down
so
as
to
suggest
the
soaked
hair
of
something
dead
the
door
and
gate
were
shut
the
verandah
and
the
white
paint
gave
the
building
a
pretentious
air
of
being
a
pleasure
house
yet
it
looked
over
the
railway
at
the
back
parts
of
the
town
at
the
railway
station
on
one
hand
at
the
cemetery
and
a
tall
chimney
on
the
other
it
had
apparently
not
been
occupied
or
for
a
little
time
only
and
was
now
empty
or
it
had
been
used
for
a
month
at
a
time
by
perhaps
half
a
dozen
families
certainly
it
had
never
become
a
house
it
was
the
corpse
the
stillborn
corpse
of
a
house
beyond
it
between
the
two
lines
of
elms
and
on
either
side
of
them
was
the
open
country
the
road
was
old
too
worn
down
like
a
into
the
sandy
soil
and
the
elms
above
either
side
made
it
dark
as
it
rose
towards
the
north
i
had
not
gone
many
yards
along
it
when
i
came
to
a
place
where
the
bank
had
been
excavated
long
ago
there
was
a
smooth
sandy
floor
and
behind
that
a
firm
wall
of
orange
sand
interlaced
by
the
stony
and
roots
of
a
great
oak
which
towered
up
from
the
top
of
the
wall
and
behind
the
trunk
the
sun
was
a
scarlet
round
in
a
dull
sky
at
the
moment
of
going
down
it
was
dark
and
still
in
this
hollowed
place
and
i
had
looked
at
it
for
some
time
before
i
heard
the
crying
of
a
child
and
saw
three
children
playing
in
the
sand
under
the
oak
they
had
dug
a
cave
in
the
sand
and
a
boy
and
a
girl
were
carrying
away
little
spadefuls
while
the
third
sat
still
among
the
roots
the
two
workers
went
silently
backwards
and
forwards
they
moved
gravely
and
without
a
word
and
i
might
have
thought
they
were
unaware
of
one
another
had
they
not
made
way
for
one
another
in
their
comings
and
goings
they
worked
as
if
in
a
dream
and
being
moved
by
some
unseen
power
their
faces
also
were
fixed
and
expressionless
their
eyes
seemed
to
be
upon
something
which
travelled
always
before
them
and
was
invisible
to
me
they
were
perhaps
seven
years
old
the
other
was
not
more
than
three
and
he
took
no
notice
of
them
as
he
sat
his
face
smeared
with
tears
and
sand
and
a
paper
bag
upon
his
lap
now
and
then
he
burst
out
into
a
fresh
sobbing
cry
just
as
suddenly
and
not
more
loudly
than
the
robin
singing
above
his
head
when
he
did
this
the
little
girl
went
up
to
him
and
shook
him
gently
and
took
a
cherry
from
the
paper
bag
and
put
it
into
his
mouth
at
this
he
became
silent
again
for
a
little
holding
the
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
rubbing
his
eyes
when
this
cure
had
been
tried
several
times
and
the
scarlet
sun
had
gone
down
out
of
the
dull
heavens
the
child
began
to
cry
more
steadily
and
it
was
in
vain
that
a
cherry
was
put
into
his
mouth
for
he
held
it
a
little
while
between
his
lips
and
did
not
notice
when
it
fell
out
but
sobbed
on
and
on
as
if
he
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
thought
nothing
felt
nothing
but
only
sobbed
i
asked
the
little
girl
what
is
the
matter
with
him
he
wants
his
mother
she
said
where
does
he
live
i
asked
as
i
stepped
towards
the
child
meaning
to
lift
him
up
over
there
she
replied
pointing
with
her
eyes
to
the
house
of
the
verandah
then
why
doesn
t
he
go
home
i
said
stopping
still
and
thinking
again
chiefly
of
the
house
his
father
is
dead
said
the
little
girl
and
the
little
boy
simultaneously
then
they
went
on
with
their
digging
while
i
turned
and
saw
the
house
looking
as
if
it
had
grown
suddenly
old
in
those
few
moments
old
and
haggard
and
so
cold
that
i
shivered
to
think
how
cold
it
must
be
in
the
behind
the
venetian
blinds
the
silence
of
the
house
and
road
was
like
a
sea
suddenly
expanding
infinitely
about
me
as
i
turned
away
the
child
s
sob
the
song
of
the
robin
the
scream
of
the
swifts
fell
into
that
dark
silence
without
breaking
it
like
tears
into
a
deep
sea
and
i
looked
at
the
house
and
saw
that
the
soul
of
the
dead
man
had
entered
it
illustration
the
bridge
at
goring
remembering
this
i
gave
up
my
spiritual
frivolity
at
cleeve
and
escaped
to
an
inn
i
suppose
i
had
been
too
much
taken
with
churchyard
names
in
the
grey
evening
to
be
quite
fair
to
the
living
landlord
at
the
inn
he
was
a
short
heavy
man
who
had
a
too
distinguished
moustache
and
talked
through
his
nose
and
had
a
straw
hat
tilted
back
on
his
neck
he
and
a
wealthy
scotchman
were
talking
together
and
invariably
by
a
slight
effort
agreeing
with
one
another
his
little
niece
came
in
with
a
flag
but
he
successfully
put
her
off
by
saying
that
he
had
a
lot
of
things
to
show
her
by
and
by
and
she
ran
away
shouting
uncle
has
a
lot
of
things
to
show
he
explained
to
the
scotchman
that
he
really
had
flags
and
things
for
the
coronation
must
do
something
everybody
will
have
spent
half
a
sovereign
it
isn
t
much
but
still
the
child
he
said
was
very
excitable
not
that
there
was
anything
wrong
oh
no
but
she
would
make
a
wonderful
actress
he
asked
the
scotchman
what
he
would
take
and
then
ordered
two
whiskies
which
i
understood
the
other
to
pay
for
they
talked
of
drinks
and
of
champagne
of
course
the
landlord
began
laughing
at
some
who
like
it
sweet
he
implied
huge
contempt
for
a
man
who
could
like
such
stuff
nevertheless
he
hastened
to
say
you
don
t
like
sweet
champagne
no
no
of
course
you
don
t
oh
yes
well
tastes
this
naturally
led
to
freemasonry
and
it
turned
out
that
the
scotchman
had
done
everything
as
a
mason
except
work
in
stone
had
served
as
chairman
etc
and
the
landlord
showed
great
eagerness
of
admiration
by
saying
have
you
really
several
times
they
returned
to
the
subject
of
drink
the
scotchman
announced
that
he
took
nothing
but
whisky
except
when
he
had
to
the
landlord
hastened
to
remark
you
are
quite
right
you
ll
live
the
longer
for
then
the
landlord
related
how
when
he
was
drunk
he
always
found
it
so
hard
to
drink
champagne
which
was
only
good
really
if
you
were
run
down
or
for
medicinal
purposes
a
very
great
deal
of
natural
philosophy
was
uttered
over
those
three
or
four
glasses
of
whisky
after
the
scotchman
had
gone
the
landlord
was
claimed
by
two
young
gentlemen
who
were
staying
under
his
roof
for
the
fishing
boating
and
alcoholic
drinks
they
called
him
arthur
and
lured
him
into
frivolities
which
he
was
not
born
to
such
as
arranging
a
band
with
tennis
rackets
for
instruments
and
serenading
the
other
visitors
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
houses
in
the
intervals
they
fortified
themselves
with
his
whisky
to
such
an
extent
that
his
leniency
towards
its
effect
was
not
to
be
surprised
at
they
also
took
care
to
keep
up
their
reputation
of
commonplace
luridity
with
the
barmaid
a
plain
girl
whose
smile
and
they
evidently
believed
everything
else
was
at
their
command
when
he
could
slip
away
from
these
sportsmen
the
landlord
straightened
his
hat
and
talked
business
to
the
barmaid
with
some
anxiety
and
no
false
generosity
but
they
were
always
shouting
for
arthur
in
shriller
and
more
discordant
voices
until
at
last
the
second
fiddle
of
the
two
burst
through
the
door
of
his
bedroom
and
rushed
across
and
fell
heavily
on
the
other
side
then
his
leader
went
quietly
to
bed
the
landlord
turned
to
his
accounts
and
the
barmaid
went
on
washing
up
glasses

to

which
is
next
door
to
a
decent
house
with
windows
and
a
most
cool
and
comfortable
expression
some
stout
and
men
stood
talking
outside
the
brewery
in
cheerful
mood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
was
a
green
enclosed
by
a
low
railing
the
village
was
a
straggling
one
and
there
were
many
newish
houses
of
pale
brick
here
and
there
as
well
as
old
timbered
cottages
i
went
into
a
grocer
s
shop
at
the
moment
when
they
were
killing
a
pig
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
neither

nor

of
it
disturbed

up

talking

the
road
was
a
dull
straight
one
going
over

a

north
of
the

and
two
and

had

if
the

its
curst
dry
monotony
on

also
sang
in
an
oak
beyond

the
road
was
better
and
had
level
green
edges
up
to
the
roses
of
the
high
hedge
on
the
right
and
the
low
one
on
the

i
could
see
across
the
oats
to
the
chilterns

dark

corner
a
straight
rank
of
trimmed
elm
trees
near
the
further
edge
and
the
line
of
on
this
side
they
made
a
foreign
scene
against
the
background
of
the
chilterns
of
a
fascinating
dreariness
one
man
was
fishing
from
the
bank
crossing
the

i
was
in

which
i
left
at

dreary
waters
had
attracted
some
thickets
which
the
loved
and
sang
in
as
by
the
wilstone

the
inns
where
they
provide
for
anglers
and
the
houses
near
the
locks
had
the
look
of
canalside
and
wharfside
settlements
a
certain
squalor
more
than
redeemed
by
the
individuality
the
unpopulated
hills
on

broken
into
sharp

always
by
a
crossing
immediately
after
the
last

before

the
road
was
at
its
best
winding
between
not

level
green
edges
of
unequal
breadth
and
hedges
of
thorns
and
roses
and
a
few
ash

on

had
been

lying
across
the
low
clover
doves
cooed
and
a
lark
overhead
sang
as
if
he
never
would
be
then
at
a
bend
where
a
ditch
came
in
and
had
a
willow
above
it
and
some
round
about
a
was
singing
the
soul
of
a
little
world
ten
yards
across
the
crossing
of
the
road
to
drayton
was
one
i
shall
not
forget
the
signpost
pointed
back
to
ivinghoe
forward
to
aylesbury
buckland
and
aston
clinton
on
the
right
to
puttenham
on
the
left
to
drayton
there
was
a
small
crook
to
the
left
before
my
road
went
forward
again
in
the
midst
of
the
meeting
ways
the
signpost
had
a
green
triangle
to
stand
on
also
each
road
had
green
borders
which
all
widened
to
the
crossing
some
of
the
borders
had
rushes
the
road
to
puttenham
swelled
up
a
little
and
fell
and
over
the
rim
showed
the
trees
of
the
vale
ahead
and
to
the
left
were
the
wooded
downs
as
i
left
the
signpost
i
had
a
very
sweet
good
morning
from
a
traveller
coming
towards
me
a
little
and
rickety
dark
foreign
man
cheerful
and
old
carrying
a
thick
satchel
on
his
back
and
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
instead
of
going
on
into
akeman
street
and
then
turning
at
right
angles
along
it
for
a
mile
i
took
a
path
half
a
mile
on
this
side
of
it
which
led
towards
buckland
church
where
the
path
crossed
the
first
hedge
a
narrow
low
embankment
went
off
to
the
left
along
the
hedge
followed
by
the
path
to
the
church
and
entering
at
last
an
elmy
and
nettly
lane
buckland
village
has
many
elm
trees
plain
little
houses
twisting
lanes
and
a
buck
s
head
in
a
dim
corner
of
them
its
church
is
of
alternating
flints
and
freestone
but
the
tower
all
of
stone
it
was
a
very
cool
place
with
a
slow
muffled
beating
clock
and
a
carpet
of
sun
lying
across
the
floor
from
the
netted
open
door
one
of
the
tablets
on
the
wall
was
to
judith
high
on
the
wall
under
the
tower
was
an
inscription
saying
near
this
place
together
with
those
of
an
infant
daughter
lie
the
earthly
remains
of
frances
russell
relict
of
william
russell
of
great
missenden
daughter
of
edward
and
frances
horwood
of
this
place
she
died
october
aged
years
the
fleeting
moments
of
prosperity
the
tedious
hours
of
adversity
and
the
lingering
illness
which
providence
allotted
she
bore
with
equanimity
and
christian
resignation
reader
go
and
do
it
was
a
rusty
and
dusty
inscription
read
mostly
by
the
bellringers
standing
under
the
tower
and
one
of
the
most
dismal
certificates
of
life
marriage
motherhood
religion
death
and
the
philosophy
of
relatives
that
i
have
seen
it
was
cheerful
afterwards
to
read
the
name
of
peter
parrot
on
a
tombstone
out
in
the
sun
illustration
aston
clinton
past
buckland
church
i
turned
to
the
right
and
almost
at
once
to
the
left
along
a
road
which
went
through
a
hayfield
and
then
became
a
borderless
hedged
road
but
with
parallel
marks
as
of
traffic
on
the
left
it
came
out
opposite
aston
clinton
church
into
akeman
street
a
main
road
of
elms
chestnuts
and
going
through
a
typical
peaceful
village
street
with
a
smithy
and
a
rose
and
crown
swan
and
palm
in
hand
an
advertisement
of
petrol
a
horse
s
brass
trappings
gleaming
under
a
tree
and
in
the
park
on
the
left
hand
a
peacock
proclaiming
the
neighbourhood
of
a
large
house
i
had
to
turn
to
the
right
along
akeman
street
for
a
quarter
mile
before
turning
out
to
the
left
into
a
road
with
houses
facing
the
park
they
were
poor
cottages
a
little
sordid
and
all
jammed
in
a
row
and
three
public
houses
amongst
them
past
these
houses
the
road
was
a
dull
straight
one
under
elms
with
a
clear
view
over
a
level
beanfield
to
the
downs
and
their
trees
with
bright
tops
and
dark
misty
shadows
below
presently
a
brooklet
appeared
alongside
the
road
among
and
overhung
by
alder
elder
and
willow
and
at
the
beginning
of
weston
turville
it
provided
entertainment
for
half
a
hundred
ducklings
the
road
went
through
the
midst
of
weston
turville
and
among
inns
on
both
sides
and
down
the
turnings
a
vine
a
chequers
a
plough
a
six
bells
a
black
horse
a
chandos
and
a
crown
followed
not
much
beyond
the
church
by
a
marquis
of
granby
and
a
swan
but
these
were
at
world
s
end
it
was
a
village
with
here
a
house
and
there
two
or
three
round
a
square
of
streets
with
the
and
elmy
church
tower
outside
it
to
the
south
and
between
the
houses
there
were
intervals
of
garden
i
noticed
a
little
house
lost
between
the
great
bare
trunks
of
half
a
forest
of
trees
in
a
timber
merchant
s
yard
i
found
an
inn
which
had
a
straight
settle
facing
a
curved
one
of
elm
with
a
sloping
back
and
reasonable
there
were
quoits
on
pegs
under
the
ceiling
and
above
the
usual
circular
target
for
darts
the
open
fireplace
had
a
kitchen
range
placed
in
it
the
floor
was
composed
of
and
red
tiles
alternating
i
did
not
make
certain
how
the
icknield
way
went
through
weston
turville
though
a
possible
course
seemed
to
turn
left
on
entering
the
village
and
go
by
brook
farm
and
malthouse
row
and
a
little
west
of
the
old
and
by
the
unless
it
took
some
such
course
it
could
hardly
have
got
to
terrick
and
little
kimble
but
must
rather
have
gone
straight
on
through
stoke
mandeville
kimblewick
and
owlswick
and
into
the
road
now
marked
lower
icknield
way
at
pitch
green
i
went
past
the
weston
reservoir
to
world
s
end
and
then
over
the
wendover
and
aylesbury
road
only
a
mile
north
of
wendover
having
clearly
in
view
the
obelisk
on
coombe
hill
and
a
little
later
the
towered
ellesborough
church
looking
ghostly
in
the
sunlight
under
beacon
hill
the
hay
was
cut
on
both
sides
and
the
road
wound
between
broad
borders
of
thistles
and
nettles
near
terrick
i
saw
the
first
meadow
crane
of
that
season
and
that
country
the
purple
flower
whose
purple
is
the
emblem
of
a
rich
inward
burning
passion
at
the
very
edges
of
the
roadside
turf
the
white
clover
grew
in
the
hawthorns
a
blackbird
sang
soon
i
came
to
kimble
station
on
the
aylesbury
branch
of
the
great
western
and
great
central
junction
railway
and
some
new
houses
one
of
them
named
beware
of
the
under
the
railway
i
turned
left
to
risborough
and
longwick
not
right
to
hartwell
and
now
the
road
settled
down
to
a
fairly
straight
course
for
about
ten
miles
with
and
rose
in
its
low
hedges
and
a
view
over
the
wheat
to
the
chilterns
it
was
usually
about
a
hundred
feet
lower
than
the
upper
way
and
from
one
to
two
miles
north
of
it
it
was
crossed
by
hardly
any
road
more
important
than
itself
except
that
from
thame
to
princes
risborough
at
this
crossing
outside
the
duke
of
wellington
or
sportsman
s
arms
a
street
organ
played
beside
the
seaside
and
other
national
anthems
little
more
than
a
mile
beyond
i
entered
oxfordshire
i
left
the
road
to
see
chinnor
church
half
a
mile
south
which
looks
southward
on
the
hills
skirted
by
the
upper
way
the
most
notable
thing
in
the
church
was
an
oval
tablet
near
the
screen
inscribed
with
the
words
beneath
lie
the
remains
of
william
turner
re
who
died
rd
march
aged
here
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
the
word
here
my
fancy
took
quite
literally
and
i
saw
a
skeleton
cramped
behind
the
tablet
protesting
to
the
living
that
there
inside
the
wall
denuded
of
flesh
and
of
all
organs
nerves
and
desires
a
wicked
man
ceased
from
troubling
and
a
weary
one
could
be
at
rest
the
teeth
of
the
skeleton
shook
in
their
dry
sockets
as
it
now
a
hundred
and
ten
years
old
uttered
those
sweet
words
here
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
some
of
the
dead
outside
bore
formidable
monosyllabic
names
such
as
wall
crook
saw
and
cocks
at
the
royal
oak
i
listened
for
half
an
hour
to
information
and
complaints
about
the
heat
which
was
at
the
time
about
ninety
degrees
in
the
shade
and
then
went
out
to
make
the
most
of
the
heat
itself
which
i
could
well
do
having
myself
as
a
good
critic
has
pronounced
an
unvarying
temperature
of
about
degrees
i
left
the
bird
in
hand
and
a
squat
white
windmill
on
the
left
and
entered
a
fine
green
road
going
straight
one
of
the
hedges
was
high
enough
for
shade
in
the
other
some
young
chestnut
trees
were
growing
up
after
some
distance
the
left
half
of
the
road
was
rough
and
had
a
ditch
along
it
then
a
tiny
stream
flowed
across
and
the
way
lost
its
left
hedge
and
went
slightly
raised
between
wheat
and
oats
poppy
and
tall
pale
scabious
after
that
i
had
clover
and
bird
trefoil
and
bedstraw
and
underfoot
corn
on
the
left
as
far
as
elms
in
masses
and
behind
these
the
chilterns
corn
on
the
right
and
ridges
of
elms
beyond
then
another
rillet
traversed
the
road
and
cooled
the
feet
in
places
the
grass
was
very
long
crossing
the
road
to
kingston
blount
the
way
was
more
used
and
rougher
as
before
it
had
corn
on
both
hands
barley
and
oats
speckled
like
a
partridge
then
a
third
rillet
and
then
wheat
barley
oats
and
beans
in
turn
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
there
were
always
elms
and
here
and
there
a
farm
under
them
beyond
the
corn
on
the
left
aston
rowant
lay
near
on
my
left
with
a
towered
church
a
big
house
and
men
upon
a
rick
at
the
edge
of
the
elms
to
cross
the
aston
road
my
way
made
a
slight
crook
to
the
left
and
then
skirted
the
hay
of
aston
rowant
park
with
elms
and
sweet
limes
amidst
the
hay
it
was
a
good
grass
and
clover
track
not
deeply
rutted
presently
in
the
mowed
and
cleared
fields
on
both
sides
cattle
were
walking
out
from
milking
with
another
slight
crook
to
the
left
the
way
crossed
the
high
wycombe
and
stokenchurch
and
oxford
road
where
were
singing
in
the
beeches
alongside
the
my
way
was
now
a
hard
road
bordered
by
beeches
and
firs
through
which
i
could
see
the
tower
of
lewknor
church
across
a
hayfield
a
with
a
voice
like
the
sweet
voice
of
someone
a
thousand
years
away
was
singing
among
the
tops
of
the
trees
below
briers
and
thorns
were
interwoven
and
grew
at
the
edge
of
the
dust
some
country
people
say
that
is
good
for
the
feet
a
belief
which
might
well
have
no
better
foundation
than
the
fact
that
it
grows
commonly
close
to
the
road
which
is
cruel
to
the
feet
on
the
right
i
passed
a
little
deserted
lodge
with
pointed
windows
and
doorway
gaping
blank
and
on
the
left
a
wood
of
beech
elm
and
chestnut
shadowing
a
wall
in
which
there
was
a
door
barricaded
almost
to
the
lintel
by
nettles
this
cool
wood
was
full
of
the
chiding
of
blackbirds
and
one
thrush
s
singing
near
the
end
this
piece
of
road
turns
decidedly
to
the
left
but
over
the
wall
on
the
right
are
some
signs
of
a
track
which
had
not
this
southward
bend
at
the
end
of
the
present
road
but
a
little
way
to
the
right
along
the
road
to
wheatfield
which
it
enters
is
moor
court
a
small
old
house
of
bricks
and
tiles
with
wings
at
each
side
and
a
massive
stone
chimney
at
the
road
end
and
it
has
a
range
of
thatched
farm
buildings
and
a
line
of
lombardy
poplars
all
enclosed
in
a
wet
moat
a
little
farther
up
a
farm
road
which
might
have
continued
the
track
on
the
right
of
the
road
just
quitted
turns
out
to
the
left
and
with
a
short
break
leads
to
pyrton
and
cuxham
and
brightwell
baldwin
and
so
to
wallingford
or
from
pyrton
the
route
might
be
to
watcombe
manor
britwell
and
ewelme
but
the
lower
icknield
way
is
to
judge
from
the
map
supposed
to
give
up
its
individuality
at
moor
court
and
make
straight
away
through
lewknor
and
by
sheepcote
lane
to
join
the
upper
road
there
seems
no
good
reason
why
this
connection
between
the
two
if
it
were
such
should
have
been
more
than
a
convenience
for
a
few
travellers
unless
we
suppose
that
the
very
hilly
and
uneven
portion
of
the
upper
road
between
the
beginning
of
the
separation
and
chinnor
hill
so
frequently
became
impassable
that
it
was
abandoned
for
short
or
long
periods
or
altogether
but
as
a
road
close
to
ewelme
was
known
in
the
seventeenth
century
as
the
lower
icknield
way
i
was
determined
to
go
by
ewelme
from
moor
court
i
went
down
to
the
pretty
group
of
a
smithy
a
leather
bottle
and
lewknor
s
towered
church
at
the
crossing
where
i
entered
the
high
road
making
past
shirburn
castle
to
watlington
at
watlington
the
road
bends
sharp
to
the
right
and
so
comes
into
line
with
the
lower
icknield
way
as
it
was
near
moor
court
this
road
between
the
chilterns
and
the
corn
was
followed
by
a
single
line
of
telegraph
wire
it
had
a
slightly
raised
green
edge
on
the
right
marked
by
footpaths
it
went
within
a
few
yards
of
the
moated
castle
of
shirburn
here
says
the
marvelling
countryside
the
drawbridge
is
nightly
drawn
up
presumably
with
the
philanthropic
motive
of
giving
work
to
somebody
i
wished
to
see
the
castle
as
the
home
of
a
library
which
has
lately
given
to
the
world
a
collection
of
ballads
from
manuscript
of
the
early
sixteenth
century
the
shirburn
but
a
great
length
of
wall
alongside
the
road
shut
off
the
view
it
was
a
bad
wall
too
and
could
not
be
liked
or
admired
for
its
own
sake
i
succeeded
only
in
seeing
one
new
battlemented
tower
which
i
was
told
supplied
water
for
the
castle
laundry
the
best
thing
at
shirburn
was
almost
opposite
the
castle
entrance
a
narrow
strip
of
land
raised
above
the
road
and
protected
from
it
by
a
row
of
goodly
elm
trees
so
that
i
walked
between
a
high
hedge
and
them
in
a
private
coolness
and
green
gloom
as
of
an
airy
church
about
a
hundred
yards
long
on
the
hedge
side
of
this
strip
there
was
a
depression
which
might
have
been
the
old
road
or
perhaps
at
one
time
the
elms
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
like
those
yonder
on
the
upper
icknield
way
under
watlington
hill
hereby
they
have
set
up

reputed
remains
of

watlington
is
a
big
square
village
of
no
great

or

antiquity
all
of

near

there
was
a

where
the
roundabouts
and
swings
of
some
travelling
company
were
putting
in
time
on
their
way
to
a

must
be
great
wisdom
in
the
men
of
watlington
to
be
able
to
harmonize
their
grave
rustic

with
the
music
as
of
a

pain
it
was
a
feat
i
could
not
accomplish

most
i
could
do
was
to
go
into

the

did

penetrate
and
the
weary
were
at
rest
it
was
a
most
beautiful
evening
and
the
swifts
were
shrieking
low
down
along
the
deserted
streets
at
nine
o
clock
i
should
like
to
see
them
crowded
with
sheep
from
ilsley
and
the
old
drover
wearing
a
thistle
in
his
cap
or
with
welsh
ponies
going
to
stokenchurch
fair
over
the
chilterns
but
there
is
no
market
at
watlington
and
nothing
but
a
pleasure
fair
a
cheap
railway
ticket
to
london
pleases
the
country
people
by
making
them
feel
near
london
whether
they
go
or
not
and
it
may
encourage
new
residents
this
was
what
my
host
wanted
his
taproom
was
much
too
peaceful
for
living
men
though
he
liked
well
enough
to
smoke
his
last
pipe
there
sitting
in
his
shirt
sleeves
until
the
silent
room
was
quite
dark
and
his
children
came
home
from
the
roundabouts
a
man
came
heavily
down
the
street
wheeling
a
barrow
stopped
outside
and
called
for
a
pint
while
he
waited
he
ruminated
looking
down
the
street
to
the
first
stars
and
whistling
beside
the
seaside
beside
the
sea
then
he
tipped
up
his
tankard
emptied
it
and
went
off
in
a
determined
manner
when
i
went
up
to
bed
i
was
astonished
to
find
a
bedroom
that
was
not
at
all
new
to
me
though
i
had
never
before
to
my
knowledge
stopped
at
this
inn
if
it
was
an
illusion
the
pictures
created
it
i
had
certainly
seen
them
before
in
wales
in
cornwall
in
wiltshire
and
in
kent
what
first
caught
my
eye
was
a
beauteous
female
of
a
far
from
slender
type
kneeling
unharmed
in
the
midst
of
roaring
waters
she
had
on
a
snowy
over
which
her
curls
flowed
far
down
in
admirable
disorder
the
foam
of
the
sea
flew
all
over
and
round
her
without
wetting
her
or
taking
the
gloss
out
of
her
curls
her
face
also
seemed
unaffected
by
her
extraordinary
position
on
a
small
isolated
rock
in
the
sea
and
wore
an
expression
that
would
have
been
better
suited
to
an
afflicted
lady
in
her
own
apartment
she
was
suffering
but
not
from
exposure
to
cold
and
wet
and
what
was
more
extraordinary
still
was
that
on
this
solitary
rock
she
had
found
a
quantity
of
thick
velvety
stuff
and
on
this
as
was
natural
she
was
kneeling
to
save
her
tender
knees
from
the
unaccustomed
rock
on
the
opposite
wall
hung
a
similar
picture
i
suppose
by
the
same
artist
for
surely
there
could
be
only
one
man
who
had
these
marvellous
visions
visions
they
must
have
been
since
no
one
could
invent
things
so
improbable
and
without
their
visionary
character
so
ridiculous
here
also
the
scene
was
a
wild
sea
and
a
rock
in
the
midst
one
beauteous
girl
of
the
same
type
as
in
the
other
picture
was
in
the
water
another
had
apparently
just
clambered
up
on
to
the
rock
i
say
apparently
but
her
was
dry
and
untorn
i
say
apparently
because
i
could
only
imagine
that
the
two
had
been
swimming
together
and
one
had
got
first
to
the
rock
for
it
was
not
likely
that
one
should
find
herself
on
a
rock
in
this
position
and
then
by
mere
chance
see
a
of
the
same
sex
age
beauty
and
costume
struggling
with
the
waves
close
by
her
struggle
was
nearly
over
for
the
beauty
on
the
rock
kneeling
on
the
velvet
carpet
which
by
a
fortunate
accident
almost
covered
it
bent
over
in
an
attitude
of
much
grace
and
caught
her
unhappy
sister
by
one
of
her
fair
hands
the
face
of
the
swimmer
was
upturned
and
exquisitely
sad
but
as
in
the
other
picture
it
was
not
the
sadness
of
a
swimmer
in
stormy
and
dark
waters
but
rather
of
a
lady
inwardly
tormented
by
some
difficulty
of
the
heart
or
of
the
spirit
to
use
a
popular
physiology
her
sadness
was
great
and
naturally
so
but
i
should
have
expected
to
see
astonishment
mingled
with
it
because
what
could
be
seen
of
her
was
dry
as
it
had
ever
been
in
the
linen
cupboard
at
her
stately
home
and
her
hair
though
loose
was
not
untidy
and
would
have
pleased
a
lover
had
she
confessed
one
and
had
he
instead
of
another
lady
been
aiding
her
in
distress
i
had
last
seen
these
two
pictures
at
tregaron
and
i
sighed
with
a
serene
and
pleasant
recollection
of
the
place
the
season
and
the
company
i
was
glad
also
to
see
a
third
work
of
the
same
artist
or
at
least
of
the
same
school
it
belonged
to
a
different
period
geological
rather
than
marine
and
again
it
must
be
insisted
that
the
work
was
visionary
because
no
one
capable
of
a
mere
invention
so
ridiculous
is
likely
to
have
the
power
and
the
patience
to
execute
it
with
such
completeness
and
finish
the
scene
was
midnight
in
a
valley
of
rocks
and
of
high
precipitous
rocky
sides
wide
enough
apart
to
have
admitted
a
mountain
torrent
of
some
size
but
it
was
dry
and
over
the
sharp
rocks
went
a
most
beautiful
lady
she
was
dressed
in
thin
and
clinging
garments
from
her
shoulders
down
to
her
ankles
to
meet
a
woman
so
beautiful
and
so
suitably
and
yet
unusually
dressed
all
alone
in
the
mountains
would
be
at
least
as
surprising
as
to
see
her
on
a
little
rock
in
the
sea
as
one
was
passing
in
a
storm
i
could
imagine
her
easily
upon
the
rock
her
arms
were
bare
and
with
one
she
clasped
a
book
to
her
left
breast
while
with
the
other
she
felt
her
way
along
the
precipitous
wall
of
the
valley
and
steadied
herself
over
the
cruel
rocks
it
was
to
be
noticed
that
there
was
no
velvet
over
these
rocks
and
this
is
another
proof
of
the
genuineness
of
the
artist
s
vision
unless
it
should
be
suspected
that
he
disliked
the
appearance
of
a
long
strip
of
carpet
all
down
a
valley
a
fierce
and
extravagant
vision
you
will
say
but
the
gentleness
which
had
somehow
ensured
the
carpet
in
the
marine
vision
had
not
been
eclipsed
in
the
geological
from
the
edge
of
the
farther
wall
of
the
valley
shone
a
light
someone
was
up
there
with
a
lantern
and
was
turning
its
beams
down
on
to
the
spot
under
the
fair
traveller
s
feet
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
he
was
following
her
along
with
the
light
but
he
could
not
be
seen
the
lantern
would
have
been
more
in
a
narrow
alley
in
a
town
but
there
was
no
question
here
of
mere
nature
if
it
comes
to
nature
was
there
ever
a
period
when
a
woman
of
such
beauty
and
of
very
great
refinement
strayed
out
with
a
book
among
inhospitable
mountains
clad
in
a
dress
that
was
fitted
rather
to
suggest
and
even
display
the
form
of
limbs
and
bosom
than
to
protect
them
from
rocks
thorns
and
weather
not
to
speak
of
men
and
other
wild
beasts
a
voluptuous
oriental
or
frenchman
might
of
course
sit
down
and
invent
an
earthly
paradise
with
a
small
population
of
like
beauties
but
their
object
would
be
as
unmistakable
as
it
would
be
objectionable
to
persons
of
sensibility
and
discipline
except
when
alone
or
off
their
guard
but
an
englishman
or
a
german
could
only
have
copied
such
a
picture
from
a
vision
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
flesh
and
a
charge
of
any
such
thing
would
recoil
upon
the
accuser
i
believe
it
was
by
an
englishman
or
a
german
i
should
like
to
see
some
of
the
work
of
his
less
visionary
moods
i
should
like
to
see
him
with
his
family
talking
to
his
wife
about
the
butcher
s
bill
and
his
daughter
s
marriage
i
should
like
to
know
if
he
had
a
daughter
or
a
child
at
all
i
should
like
to
see
him
with
his
friends
after
dinner
and
reading
george
moore
s
of
my
dead
i
thought
at
one
time
that
one
of
the
other
pictures
was
by
the
same
man
partly
because
it
is
so
often
to
be
seen
with
his
work
and
appeals
to
the
same
people
such
as
myself
and
partly
because
it
had
a
similar
detachment
from
modern
life
but
i
could
not
feel
sure
that
it
was
the
result
of
a
vision
and
not
of
pure
invention
the
scene
was
a
summer
garden
sloping
down
to
a
river
and
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
a
terrace
of
turf
and
a
flight
of
steps
to
the
water
on
the
terrace
four
girls
were
having
tea
they
were
much
thinner
than
those
on
the
rocks
they
wore
white
clinging
dresses
and
their
heads
were
bare
they
were
all
smiling
and
their
faces
were
such
that
no
man
could
imagine
a
god
providence
fate
parent
lover
doctor
or
little
boy
in
the
street
enough
to
interrupt
the
smiles
human
beings
like
them
are
not
to
be
seen
now
and
no
portraits
or
records
of
them
in
the
past
have
come
down
to
us
they
seemed
born
to
eat
chocolate
and
drink
sweet
lemonade
and
never
suffer
from
the
consequences
there
had
been
five
of
them
but
one
stood
on
the
bottom
step
feeding
two
swans
without
any
apparent
effort
she
had
a
hat
in
her
hand
either
because
a
hat
is
more
beautiful
than
a
hand
or
because
it
is
more
easy
to
draw
she
was
hanging
down
her
head
thinking
of
something
or
it
might
be
nothing
unconnected
with
the
swans
or
the
slow
still
river
behind
her
a
person
whose
mouth
would
not
melt
butter
stood
looking
at
her
back
he
was
dressed
in
pretty
breeches
and
buckled
shoes
and
was
interesting
chiefly
as
making
the
observer
marvel
what
witty
power
had
added
a
creature
so
appropriate
to
such
a
company
as
marvellous
must
have
been
the
artist
s
invention
if
it
could
be
imagined
that
dresses
should
out
of
their
own
spirit
magically
produce
beings
to
wear
them
they
would
be
like
these
five
ladies
and
if
dainty
breeches
silk
stockings
and
buckled
shoes
should
have
the
same
power
they
would
unfold
a
man
like
the
lover
the
effect
of
the
whole
was
to
suggest
summer
a
lovely
and
harmless
place
for
the
artist
s
fresh
water
would
not
drown
any
more
than
his
sea
water
would
wet
a
wealth
luxury
happiness
youth
frivolity
innocence
benevolence
to
suggest
them
especially
to
those
who
know
very
little
of
these
things
there
were
several
pictures
of
scenery
one
showed
a
steep
and
very
romantic
forest
road
it
was
deep
in
snow
and
enormous
trees
whose
roots
were
nourished
in
hades
towered
up
above
on
either
hand
but
let
in
the
light
of
a
full
moon
that
shone
straight
down
the
road
towards
the
moon
and
up
the
road
went
a
tall
mantled
traveller
leaning
on
a
staff
and
turning
his
head
to
look
into
the
wood
the
picture
had
no
name
text
or
explanation
it
was
a
nameless
man
and
a
nameless
traveller
both
unknown
to
history
nothing
was
happening
it
was
simply
a
combination
of
four
or
five
grand
simple
elements
a
mighty
forest
a
moon
snow
a
solitary
road
a
tall
traveller
one
of
the
other
pictures
was
the
same
except
that
a
foaming
river
took
the
place
of
the
snowy
road
the
forest
and
the
moon
were
the
same
the
traveller
was
not
there
and
to
one
who
had
seen
the
last
picture
there
was
a
touch
of
tragedy
in
his
absence
which
atoned
for
it
he
might
have
been
surprised
at
the
very
moment
when
the
snowy
road
was
being
changed
into
a
foaming
river
those
who
had
not
seen
the
other
had
to
be
content
with
a
moon
a
romantic
forest
a
river
running
down
through
it
and
foam
instead
of
snow
it
hardly
seemed
to
me
to
be
enough
lacking
the
human
interest
a
small
flock
of
sheep
among
the
trees
with
or
even
without
a
shepherd
would
have
made
a
vital
difference
and
the
picture
could
then
also
have
been
recognized
by
purchasers
and
recipients
of
christmas
cards
and
this
picture
was
one
which
would
appeal
to
those
who
knew
the
kind
of
thing
depicted
rough
woodlanders
and
their
wives
people
who
have
suffered
in
snow
poor
men
who
have
travelled
alone
and
leaned
on
their
staffs
would
gladly
put
both
pictures
on
their
walls
there
were
photographs
of
such
people
on
the
mantelpiece
people
whom
no
best
clothes
or
photographer
s
polish
could
turn
into
poetic
heroes
or
beauties
men
with
queer
hairy
faces
legs
bent
like
oak
branches
and
eyes
squinting
at
the
photographer
women
their
equals
but
if
anything
more
hardened
more
tortured
more
smiling
upon
the
occasion
of
being
photographed
between
photographs
of
a
gamekeeper
whose
face
was
like
a
furze
bush
with
eyes
in
it
and
a
card
of
mourning
for
jane
mary
sims
aged
hung
a
picture
seeming
to
have
little
to
do
with
either
it
was
of
a
and
lady
with
regular
features
and
graceful
mature
figure
sitting
beside
a
cradled
child
she
was
bending
over
towards
the
child
and
her
face
though
composed
was
sorrowful
had
she
looked
up
she
would
have
seen
an
unusual
sight
and
it
was
a
mercy
that
she
did
not
for
it
would
have
certainly
upset
her
composure
through
astonishment
and
fear
for
not
many
feet
from
her
was
the
head
of
a
human
being
who
was
coming
towards
her
head
foremost
through
the
window
or
more
probably
the
ceiling
i
say
a
human
being
because
her
body
it
was
a
mature
and
athletic
slender
lady
was
of
the
same
general
form
size
and
proportions
as
those
of
our
own
species
and
she
wore
the
clinging
so
much
favoured
by
the
visionary
artist
but
she
had
wings
attached
to
her
shoulders
not
large
enough
to
be
of
any
use
supposing
her
to
have
learned
their
management
but
sufficient
to
make
part
of
a
becoming
fancy
dress
or
fairy
dancing
costume
she
had
apparently
dived
from
some
height
and
in
a
bewitching
attitude
was
making
straight
for
the
cradle
as
she
was
no
ariel
s
sister
capable
of
playing
i
th
plighted
clouds
the
danger
both
to
her
and
to
the
cradle
was
great
she
faced
it
with
no
sign
of
fear
her
soft
eyes
and
her
even
and
not
too
full
lips
expressing
a
mind
in
tranquillity
and
scarcely
if
at
all
stirred
by
expectation
or
surmise
there
was
no
sequel
to
this
daring
but
painful
picture
nor
of
course
any
explanation
it
was
i
should
say
the
fancy
of
a
genius
who
had
mingled
the
common
and
the
improbable
in
dreams
produced
by
opium
or
other
drug

at

salome
and
next
the
the

was
scattered
among
trees
not
interrupting
the
smell
of
hay
the
road
skirted
it
and
was
soon
out
again
amongst
the
wheat
and
passing
britwell
park
where
the
cattle
were
crossing
in
a
straight
line
between
groups
of
elms
in
the
hedge
there
was
bracken
along
with
the
yellow
bedstraw
and
white
bryony
for
a
time
there
were
gorse
and
bracken
together
on
the
green
strip
above
the

then
instead
of
going
straight
on
to
benson
i
turned
to
the
left
for

hill

and
wallingford
beyond
this
turn
all
the
country
round
was
high
bare
cornland
undulating
to
the
darker

the
road
had
nettles
for
a
hedge
or
sometimes
brier
scabious
and
and
once
some
more
purple
meadow

it
had
steep
banks

no

this
was
not
the

would
never
have
dipped
down
to

up
again

of

were

standing
high

of

the
churchyard
covered
the
slope
down
from

upper
to
the
lower
village
and
in
the
midst
stood
the
church
a
venerable
one
with
a
particularly
neat
growth
of
ivy
across
the
tower
i
could
not
get
into
the
church
but
could
hear
the
clock
ticking
in
the
emptiness
in
the
churchyard
i
noticed
this
devout
fancy
over
the
body
of
alice
heath
who
died
in
kind
angels
watch
this
sleeping
dust
till
jesus
comes
to
raise
the
just
then
may
they
wake
with
sweet
surprise
and
in
their
saviour

image
rise
illustration
watlington
town
hall
i
should
like
to
know
what
was
in
the
s
mind
when
he
penned
the
first
line
the
word
surprise
pleased
me
most
though
due
to
a
rhyme
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
writer
s
mind
through
grief
might
have
been
in
the
same
condition
as
the
bedroom
artist
at
watlington
who
drew
the
lady
and
the
cradle
and
the
beautiful
winged
diver
i
believe
that
this
artist
would
have
translated
literally
into
pictorial
form
the
words
kind
angels
watch
this
sleeping
dust
he
would
have
shown
a
neat
grassy
churchyard
with
an
immemorial
church
tower
in
the
background
scattered
over
the
turf
close
to
the
church
would
be
an
indistinct
crowd
of
tombstones
nearer
and
clearer
he
would
present
a
new
and
costly
stone
probably
in
the
form
of
a
cross
standing
at
the
top
of
three
or
four
steps
many
wreaths
of
rare
and
costly
flowers
would
lie
unfaded
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
on
the
lowest
step
two
figures
of
exceptional
beauty
and
dignity
would
be
kneeling
without
sign
of
impatience
or
any
other
emotion
they
would
be
in
the
customary
costume
of
these
pictures
and
the
onlooker
would
marvel
what
they
were
doing
and
if
he
knew
that
they
were
watching
the
dust
below
he
would
still
conjecture
as
to
what
they
were
to
watch
against
and
how
they
proposed
to
resist
the
attempts
of
any
robbing
man
beast
dragon
or
other
monster
but
it
is
unlikely
that
any
such
picture
was
in
the
mind
of
the
ewelme
he
or
she
had
perhaps
no
distinct
image
choosing
words
that
would
fit
the
metre
and
not
be
in
any
way
surprising
to
the
religious
he
thought
of
angels
and
of
dust
and
the
need
of
epithets
pretty
soon
suggested
kind
and
nevertheless
when
i
read
it
i
came
so
near
to
forming
an
image
rather
in
the
style
of
the
bedroom
artist
that
it
is
possible
the
writer
had
an
image
or
vision
of
some
sort
and
handed
it
on
to
me
in
that
early
july
morning
before
anyone
was
on
the
roads
or
in
the
churchyard
there
was
a
much
better
stone
and
delicately
writ
inscription
near
the
east
window
the
stone
a
very
thin
shouldered
one
had
slipped
down
into

was

two

height

aloud

like
foreigners
over

of

dog
that
shivers
under

do
not
see
why
it
should

it

difficult
to
attack

extraordinary

think
as
they

by

turning
down
to

how
a
lot
of
lazy
fellows
with
nothing
to
do
and
with
only
rags
on
them
can
get
enough
to
spend
half
a

there
that
ought
certainly
not
to
be
allowed

well
dressed
that

obviously
need
not
work
or
something
is

invariably
look

another

the
old
tree
and
makes
it
look
friendly
as
you
go
in
and
romantic
as
you
come
out
it
is
best
at
haymaking
or
harvest
time
in
fine
weather
the
irregular
labourers
come
into
the
town
especially
on
a
saturday
and
break
their
journey
at
the
jolly
drover
the
townsman
glances
in
as
he
passes
and
sees
a
tall
straight
man
in
a
restful
attitude
standing
up
at
the
bar
and
he
has
just
raised
his
pot
to
drink
it
is
only
a
glimpse
of
a
second
but
it
remains
in
the
mind
the
could
not
say
how
the
drinker
was
clad
except
that
he
wore
a
loose
hat
on
his
head
pushed
back
so
as
to
leave
quite
clear
against
the
lamp
the
whole
of
a
long
face
the
brow
and
the
curled
hair
up
to
the
crown
was
it
coat
and
trousers
or
just
shirt
and
trousers
at
any
rate
the
whole
man
could
be
seen
underneath
not
that
the
observer
did
not
as
a
rule
admire
a
man
fully
and
fashionably
dressed
only
in
this
light
just
this
harvest
evening
of
purple
and
of
great
silence
the
tall
man
drinking
with
head
thrown
back
at
the
end
of
the
passage
looked
more
like
the
statues
of
a
bygone
age
or
the
representations
of
magnificent
men
seen
in
pictures
or
the
soldiers
he
has
read
of
in
books
about
the
wars
of
roundhead
and
cavalier
or
the
invasions
of
wales
and
scotland
yes
the
height
and
carriage
of
this
man
call
up
the
words
rough
a
lance
or
a
long
sword
would
look
well
in
his
hands
his
hat
is
not
unlike
a
s
helmet
and
then
the
face
coarse
fearless
and
careless
is
an
enigma
he
is
some
fellow
without
a
house
or
wife
or
any
goods
or
gods
yet
this
is
how
the
admirer
used
to
picture
lords
and
generals
when
a
little
boy
at
school
he
is
not
thinking
about
rent
accounts
education
clothes
the
poor
church
chapel
appendicitis
or
this
time
next
year
he
is
not
apparently
in
a
hurry
he
has
no
vote
and
one
party
in
power
is
as
good
as
the
other
to
him
no
doubt
a
wasteful
fellow
has
fallen
perhaps
through
drink
is
possibly
but
would
not
stop
short
at
violence
on
occasion
idle
with
all
his
strength
and
yet
and
yet
the
figure
and
face
against
the
light
stick
in
the
mind
of
the
man
out
in
the
street
he
is
discontented
he
grumbles
at
his
wife
when
he
goes
in
because
she
has
not
done
something
and
he
does
more
he
grows
enraged
when
he
finds
that
she
really
has
done
it
but
has
not
had
time
to
tell
him
he
lies
still
in
bed
on
his
back
thinking
for
a
long
time
his
wife
lies
still
and
he
knows
that
she
also
is
awake
thinking
he
says
good
night
hoping
she
will
say
something
to
comfort
him
for
his
fruitless
wakefulness
but
she
says
good
night
and
no
more
they
remain
silent
he
has
the
image
of
the
drinker
clear
in
the
darkness
before
he
falls
asleep
left
entirely
alone
his
wife
sighs
and
presently
she
also
is
asleep
but
i
do
not
wish
to
say
that
wallingford
is
as
respectable
as
coldiston
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
ford
below
is
very
old
and
it
is
highly
probable
that
some
travellers
on
the
icknield
way
followed
the
road
i
had
been
on
from
gypsies
corner
to
wallingford
and
then
into
the
berkshire
ickleton
street
at
blewbury
if
not
before
others
avoiding
wallingford
might
have
crossed
at
little
stoke
from
which
a
westward
road
goes
up
called
the
papist
from
wallingford
i
made
for
the
papist
way
following
a
series
of
paths
and
roads
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
east
of
the
river
i
went
past
the
little
towerless
and
spireless
church
of
newnham
murren
which
had
a
number
of
crooked
tombstones
and
was
itself
covered
with
ivy
which
traveller
s
joy
was
beginning
to
climb
then
over
grim
s
ditch
a
mile
and
a
half
west
of
the
icknield
way
crossing
i
came
to
mongewell
park
and
my
path
was
along
a
line
of
huge
elms
and
sweet
limes
on
my
left
the
main
road
and
its
telegraph
wires
ran
bordered
with
charlock
along
the
top
of
a
low
ridge
above
these
meadows
from
north
stoke
there
was
a
good
road
i
turned
aside
to
the
church
but
found
what
was
better
a
big
range
of
tiled
thatched
sheds
and
barns
extending
on
either
side
of
my
path
with
a
in
the
midst
full
of
dazzling
straw
and
cow
dung
and
a
big
black
sow
lying
on
it
like
a
recumbent
statue
on
a
huge
pedestal
swifts
were
shrieking
above
and
chickens
clucking
in
the
corners
from
the
road
the
tiled
church
and
the
thatched
barn
fell
into
line
and
seemed
one
especially
as
the
farm
pigeons
were
perched
on
the
ridges
of
both
on
a
behind
i
saw
the
figure
of
a
sheep
on
a
this
road
went
alongside
hedgeless
barley
on
the
left
over
which
i
could
see
the
bare
low
hills
between
me
and
the
icknield
way
and
far
beyond
them
the
wooded
hills
about
nuffield
and
nettlebed
on
the
right
there
was
hay
to
the
river
there
was
succory
on
the
roadside
scabious
knapweed
and
long
grass
to
reach
the
ferry
at
little
stoke
i
turned
off
to
the
right
under
elm
trees
and
was
rowed
across
the
boy
told
me
that
the
road
up
from
the
ferry
was
called
asylum
road
there
being
a
big
red
lunatic
asylum
on
the
side
of
it
just
as
it
crossed
the
reading
and
wallingford
road
only
beyond
this
crossing
is
it
marked
papist
way
on
the
map
i
have
not
discovered
why
it
was
named
so
for
the
name
suggests
too
late
a
date
to
be
connected
with
the
monastery
which
lay
near
where
the
road
reaches
the
great
western
railway
station
at
cholsey
it
points
to
the
astons
blewbury
and
upton
and
may
at
one
time
have
formed
part
of
a
road
running
through
them
to
wantage
unless
this
road
is
rather
a
protraction
of
the
road
from
south
stoke
and
moulsford
which
may
however
have
joined
the
papist
way
at
lollingdon
they
were
talking
about
roads
at
the
morning
star
on
the
left
side
of
the
papist
the
fat
drayman
and
the
smart
butcher
s
boy
agreed
that
were
ruining
the
good
roads
the
rubber
wheels
can
travel
on
the
smoothest
possible
surface
which
is
the
modern
ideal
hoofs
on
the
other
hand
need
something
to
bite
into
the
drayman
with
his
heavy
waggon
would
do
away
with
here
the
needy
cyclist
interrupted
and
said
that
he
had
never
known
better
times
the
smooth
roads
were
as
good
for
him
as
for
all
cursed
their
dust
their
stink
their
insolence
and
all
looked
with
some
admiration
at
the
chauffeur
who
came
in
for
a
glass
and
out
again
in
a
minute
outside
the
flies
were
terrifying
the
horses
for
the
first
time
in
the
summer
and
the
drivers
inside
yelled
at
them
but
seldom
moved
from
their
beer
one
driver
was
a
man
with
big
red
ears
and
a
serious
quizzical
face
with
a
beard
he
came
in
wearing
a
fine
musk
thistle
which
he
seemed
to
think
was
scotch
but
immediately
on
being
given
a
bunch
of
sweet
peas
he
threw
it
away
if
this
had
been
his
preference
it
would
have
been
absurd
enough
as
if
a
musk
thistle
were
not
better
than
all
the
sweet
peas
ever
contrived
by
man
and
god
but
he
took
the
garden
flowers
because
they
were
things
having
a
price
and
because
they
were
a
gift
illustration
by
lollingdon
farm
the
papist
way
was
a
hard
road
winding
between
wheat
and
beans
for
half
a
mile
then
it
crossed
the
wallingford
and
cholsey
road
and
was
interrupted
by
the
railway
embankment
its
course
on
the
farther
side
of
this
seemed
to
be
marked
by
a
division
between
barley
and
potatoes
to
the
left
of
the
present
road
this
line
was
continued
through
pancroft
from
which
a
path
went
along
the
hedges
to
lollingdon
this
was
over
black
rushy
lands
haunted
by
pewits
the
road
a
little
on
the
left
leading
also
to
lollingdon
farm
was
on
better
ground
winding
westward
under
the
wooded
swell
of
the
round
hill
called
lollingdon
hill
the
farm
had
a
big
home
meadow
with
ash
and
poplar
enclosing
it
almost
as
if
it
had
been
a
quadrangle
with
cloisters
round
there
were
many
thatched
farm
buildings
in
the
corner
and
a
fine
walnut
tree
and
a
beautiful
abundance
of
poppies
and
dusty
nettle
and
dusty
mallow
against
the
walls
the
road
had
an
elmy
hedge
on
its
right
but
nothing
on
the
left
between
it
and
the
oats
that
reached
up
to
the
beeches
of
lollingdon
the
long
grass
and
knapweed
and
succory
by
the
roadside
were
blossoming
with
white
and
butterflies
which
flew
away
from
their
stalks
as
ducklings
swim
away
from
their
unamphibious
the
butterflies
flew
after
one
another
sometimes
a
white
after
a
brown
the
sun
was
perfect
for
them
there
being
fewer
clouds
than
there
were
eight
hours
back
for
as
i
walked
i
heard
a
pleasant
bell
strike
two
at
aston
aston
tirrold
and
aston
upthorpe
make
a
square
of
roads
with
many
lanes
and
paths
crossing
from
one
side
to
another
in
the
square
are
big
houses
and
small
and
their
gardens
and
old
nettly
orchards
and
many
sycamores
elms
chestnuts
and
acacias
in
the
gardens
and
along
the
paths
there
are
even
some
small
fields
within
it
running
water
goes
through
it
here
you
pass
a
mud
wall
there
a
hedge
here
a
boarded
there
a
thatched
and
again
a
tiled
cottage
at
some
of
the
corners
and
in
the
churchyard
stand
lime
trees
if
a
happy
child
had
all
the
ingredients
of
old
villages
to
play
with
it
would
if
it
were
ingenious
probably
combine
them
thus
the
farms
are
all
outside
the
square
but
close
to
it
the
churches
are
near
the
edge
but
within
it
i
hardly
believed
that
anybody
remained
alive
in
the
village
until
i
failed
to
open
the
door
of
aston
tirrold
church
aston
upthorpe
church
was
a
small
tiled
building
with
a
stupid
little
spire
stuck
on
yesterday
to
show
that
it
was
not
part
of
the
neighbouring
tiled
farm
and
outhouses
the
village
hid
itself
well
on
both
sides
under
its
elms
from
the
east
it
seemed
all
trees
and
orchards
from
the
west
only
the
new
thatch
of
a
rick
betrayed
it
my
road
led
along
the
south
side
of
the
village
and
commanded
a
simple
perfect
piece
of
downland
a
bare
even
wall
of
down
with
an
almost
straight
ridge
which
was
also
bare
but
for
one
clump
along
the
foot
of
the
wall
ran
the
main
road
to
wantage
up
from
it
an
old
trackway
very
deeply
worn
rose
slanting
and
showing
one
old
steep
green
bank
up
to
the
ridge
and
over
and
at
the
point
where
the
trackway
crossed
the
main
road
the
turf
was
carved
by
a
illustration
blewbury
a
broad
track
and
several
parallel
paths
went
fairly
straight
without
hedges
westward
through
the
corn
to
blewbury
passing
close
under
the
south
side
of
a
bare
sudden
hill
blewburton
hill
and
the
ramparts
of
a
supposed
danish
camp
blewbury
was
like
aston
with
a
streamlet
many
trees
and
orchards
and
a
towered
church
standing
in
the
midst
of
several
paths
and
roads
the
clock
was
beating
slowly
with
such
gigantic
and
ancient
peace
inside
the
church
that
i
did
not
enter
it
was
as
if
some
hoary
giant
were
sleeping
inside
away
from
the
sun
if
indeed
he
had
not
been
there
for
some
centuries
outside
the
church
lay
a
dilapidated
and
pair
of
prostrate
effigies
if
it
were
not
disturbing
the
sleeper
in
blewbury
church
i
should
suggest
that
these
effigies
might
be
taken
in
they
are
much
to
be
preferred
to
the
clean
effigies
which
have
never
borne
the
weather
of
god
or
the
of
men
but
if
they
are
left
outside
much
longer
they
will
hardly
pass
as
representations
of
two
human
beings
lying
on
their
backs
the
south
side
of
blewbury
touched
the
main
reading
and
wantage
road
and
had
several
inns
a
barley
mow
a
catherine
wheel
a
george
and
dragon
a
sawyer
s
arms
a
load
of
mischief
and
at
its
west
end
a
new
i
was
glad
to
see
that
the
load
of
mischief
still
upheld
its
sign
and
name
i
feared
that
it
might
have
been
renamed
the
red
lion
or
the
crown
and
have
been
robbed
of
its
sign
but
there
was
the
sign
and
almost
opposite
a
window
where
i
was
equally
glad
and
surprised
to
see
an
advertisement
of
votes
for
the
load
of
mischief
was
a
woman
of
a
type
belonging
to
a
day
hardly
later
than
hogarth
s
mounted
on
the
shoulders
of
a
man
the
man
was
a
mere
small
beast
of
burden
the
woman
was
magnificent
a
huge
lusty
brown
virago
and
she
was
holding
in
her
hand
a
glass
clearly
labelled
this
woman
and
her
spouse
were
painted
on
both
sides
of
the
so
that
all
coming
from
north
and
from
south
should
see
it
i
forgot
to
inquire
whether
the
load
of
mischief
was
a
fully
licensed
house
and
sold
gin
probably
it
was
the
sign
was
not
a
beerhouse
s
defamation
of
gin
it
did
not
deny
that
gin
was
a
very
good
thing
it
did
not
assert
anything
more
than
that
a
big
woman
on
a
small
man
s
shoulders
was
a
load
of
how
impossible
it
is
even
in
this
sporting
country
to
think
of
a
sign
depicting
a
big
man
on
a
little
woman
s
shoulders
no
woman
ever
painted
a
i
suppose
and
no
woman
keeping
an
inn
would
put
up
such
a
one
as
the
load
of
a
woman
who
drank
gin
was
a
load
of
mischief
on
the
other
hand
a
man
who
made
the
gin
for
her
provided
that
he
grew
rich
on
it
became
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
a
member
of
parliament
if
his
father
made
it
he
became
a
bishop
it
is
the
difference
between
mind
and
matter
between
and
manual
labour
the
member
of
parliament
or
the
bishop
s
father
had
only
to
think
about
gin
he
might
never
have
tasted
it
the
woman
had
to
swallow
it
and
pay
for
it
therefore
she
grew
poor
while
he
grew
rich
a
history
of
england
was
once
written
entirely
to
show
this
difference
to
insist
upon
it
and
to
teach
the
consumer
that
he
must
never
forget
his
duties
and
responsibilities
to
the
manufacturer
and
to
remind
the
manufacturer
of
his
privileges
it
was
called
a
history
of
england
for
and
sons
of
gentlemen
or
a
guide
to
sycophancy
and
other
services
to
the
aristocracy
and
plutocracy
and
to
keeping
in
your
it
was
published
in
and
is
used
in
schools
when
i
went
into
one
of
the
inns
there
was
a
woman
seated
in
the
taproom
drinking
beer
a
shrill
and
lean
woman
of
middle
age
somewhat
in
liquor
and
with
boots
in
which
she
had
walked
fifteen
miles
and
had
nine
still
to
do
whether
or
not
because
he
had
drunk
more
her
husband
had
gone
on
by
train
she
said
she
had
sent
she
foresaw
that
it
was
not
going
to
rain
that
day
she
claimed
no
credit
for
the
foresight
her
corns
alone
had
the
power
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
left
she
was
a
woman
that
walked
fast
but
stopped
often
she
carried
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
black
skirt
not
long
after
she
had
started
the
rain
fell
down
upon
her
as
it
did
upon
the
roofs
mackintoshes
and
umbrellas
of
the
brewers
publicans
and

from
the
west
of
blewbury
to
upton
there
was
another
mile
of
broad
green
tracks
through
corn
without
a
tree
between
them
and
the
round
smooth
downs
with
their
tumuli
clear
against
the
sky
on
the
left
hand
at
upton
this
series
of
roads
from
little
stoke
entered
the
main
road
or
crossed
it
and
continued
without
touching
any
villages
on
the
way
to
lockinge
and
wantage
but
this
further
road
was
a
continuation
of
the
line
of
the
main
road
before
it
turned
north
to
upton
and
west
to
hagbourne
and
might
have
been
an
alternative
course
to
wantage
or
part
of
an
earlier
way
perhaps
the
icknield
way
itself
which
some
have
supposed
to
go
nearer
the
downs
than
the
main
road
now
does
as
i
meant
at
another
time
to
travel
this
road
and
its
parallels
from
streatley
to
the
wiltshire
border
i
returned
to
blewbury
and
at
one
of
the
six
inns
read
james
montgomery
s
a
poem
of
in
nine
cantos
the
poem
seemed
to
have
been
started
and
carried
on
under
the
influence
of
an
ecstasy
given
to
the
author
by
an
explorer
s
book
in
his
to
terra
then
not
long
published
captain
matthew
flinders
had
described
two
little
islands
the
and
antique
cemetery
of
pelicans
islets
of
a
hidden
lagoon
of
an
uninhabited
island
situate
upon
an
unknown
coast
near
the
antipodes
of
this
evidently
impressed
montgomery
with
a
strong
feeling
of
solitariness
he
imagined
himself
alone
when
sky
sun
and
sea
were
all
the
universe
himself
a
spirit
all
eye
ear
thought
what
the
soul
can
make
itself
at
pleasure
that
i
for
thrice
a
thousand
years
he
saw
none
but
the
people
of
the
sea
beings
for
whom
the
universe
was
made
yet
none
of
kindred
with
myself
in
vain
i
strove
to
waken
sympathy
in
breasts
cold
as
the
element
in
which
they
moved
and
inaccessible
to
fellowship
with
me
as
sun
and
stars
as
winds
and
vapours
under
the
sea
also
he
saw
relics
huge
and
strange
of
the
old
world
that
perish
d
by
the
flood
kept
under
chains
of
darkness
till
the
judgment
he
watched
the
making
of
a
coral
islet
compared
with
which
men
s
work
seemed
nothing
a
comparison
which
set
him
thinking
of
the
grandeurs
of
earth
among
them
of
babylon
built
for
eternity
though
where
it
stood
ruin
itself
stands
still
for
lack
of
work
and
desolation
keeps
unbroken
sabbath
he
saw
the
islet
grow
and
become
hospitable
the
and
many
things
were
swept
up
on
to
it
while
heaven
s
dew
fell
on
the
sterile
wilderness
as
sweetly
as
though
it
were
the
garden
of
the
lord
grass
grew
insects
swarmed
he
witnessed
the
age
of
gold
in
that
green
trees
and
flowers
rose
up
reptiles
and
amphibious
monsters
appeared
then
came
more
admirable
beings
flocking
from
every
point
of
heaven
and
filling
eye
ear
and
mind
with
objects
sounds
emotions
akin
to
livelier
sympathy
and
love
than
reptiles
fishes
insects
could
inspire
birds
the
free
tenants
of
land
air
and
ocean
their
forms
all
symmetry
their
motions
grace
in
plumage
delicate
and
beautiful
thick
without
burthen
close
as
fishes
scales
or
loose
as
poppies
to
the
breeze
with
wings
that
might
have
had
a
soul
within
them
they
bore
their
owners
by
such
sweet
enchantment
birds
small
and
great
of
endless
shapes
and
colours
here
flew
and
perched
there
swam
and
dived
at
pleasure
watchful
and
agile
uttering
voices
wild
and
harsh
yet
in
accordance
with
the
waves
upon
the
beach
the
winds
in
caverns
moaning
or
winds
and
waves
abroad
upon
the
water
his
was
an
eager
rapturous
temperament
next
to
birds
he
seems
to
have
loved
the
insect
legions
children
of
light
and
air
and
fire
he
calls
them
their
lives
all
ecstasy
and
quick
cross
motion
but
birds
and
insects
did
not
confine
his
sympathy
they
did
not
turn
it
aside
from
the
elephant
leading
his
quiet
life
among
his
old
contemporary
whether
it
was
through
the
impulse
of
the
discoverer
s
words
or
as
is
more
likely
through
his
own
nature
he
was
able
to
suggest
with
some
power
the
world
that
does
without
men
the
sterile
wilderness
not
neglected
by
the
dew
the
paradise
without
man
and
without
death
where
bliss
had
newly
alighted
and
shut
close
his
rainbow
wings
to
rest
at
ease
nor
dread
intruding
ill
i
think
he
was
enchanted
by
those
tropical
airy
aisles
and
living
colonnades
where
nations
might
have
worshipp
d
god
in
peace
for
with
an
energy
which
a
tree
would
call
religious
he
describes
their
flourishing
and
how
the
indian
fig
was
multiplied
from
year
to
year
their
fruits
ungather
d
fall
not
lost
but
quickening
where
they
lay
they
struck
root
downward
and
brake
forth
on
every
hand
till
the
strong
saplings
rank
and
file
stood
up
a
mighty
army
which
o
erran
the
isle
and
changed
the
wilderness
into
a
forest
his
love
of
things
that
are
not
men
that
are
happy
and
without
conscience
is
more
instinctive
than
his
desire
for
men
in
his
solitude
they
though
kindred
spirits
never
moved
him
to
a
picture
like
the
flamingoes
flying
till
on
some
lonely
coast
alighting
again
their
gorgeous
cohort
took
the
field
i
was
not
surprised
then
at
the
seventh
canto
to
find
him
saying
in
wordsworthian
strain
that
we
only
begin
to
live
from
that
fine
point
which
memory
dwells
on
with
the
morning
star
the
earliest
note
we
heard
the
cuckoo
sing
or
the
first
daisy
that
we
ever
pluck
d
when
thoughts
themselves
were
stars
and
birds
and
flowers
pure
brilliance
simplest
music
wild
perfume
my
copy
of
the
book
was
printed
in
it
had
the
date
under
the
old
owner
s
name
and
i
suppose
that
not
many
editions
have
been
published
since
or
any
since
yet
this
individual
character
of
the
writer
original
as
much
in
degree
as
in
kind
had
kept
the
book
alive
the
energy
of
his
ecstasy
gave
his
blank
verse
a
gushing
flow
that
may
cause
sleep
but
seldom
impatience
and
never
contempt
the
overflowing
of
so
many
lines
into
an
extra
unaccented
syllable
seemed
a
natural
effect
of
his
possession
by
his
subject
and
not
a
device
or
a
mere
habit
at
its
best
it
had
the
eloquence
of
an
improvisation
as
i
shut
this
book
it
reminded
me
of
a
poem
called
deck
a
by
ralph
hodgson
where
a
similar
rapt
picture
of
a
manless
eden
is
painted
but
with
a
passion
that
is
controlled
to
a
quivering
repose
by
an
art
finer
than
montgomery
s
there
the
passion
is
double
for
the
poet
s
love
of
the
life
and
beauty
of
birds
is
turned
to
an
anger
too
deep
for
hate
against
the
woman
bloodwant
shrill
for
beauty
s
veins
and
the
men
who
satisfy
and
provoke
her
desire
for
feathers
the
same
poet
s
is
a
curious
instance
of
passion
submitting
itself
to
the
quietest
of
smiling
rhymes
i
saw
with
open
eyes
singing
birds
sweet
sold
in
the
shops
for
the
people
to
eat
sold
in
the
shops
of
stupidity
street
i
saw
in
vision
the
worm
in
the
wheat
and
in
the
shops
nothing
for
people
to
eat
nothing
for
sale
in
stupidity
street
i
was
glad
that
i
had
taken
with
me
as
my
only
book
for
if
i
had
not
i
might
very
likely
never
have
read
it
yet
it
might
have
escaped
me
even
though
it
was
in
my
pocket
unless
a
man
always
carries
a
book
with
him
when
he
does
take
one
it
is
often
a
little
too
well
chosen
or
rather
chosen
too
deliberately
because
it
is
a
very
good
one
or
is
just
the
right
one
or
is
one
that
ought
to
be
read
but
walking
is
apt
to
relieve
him
of
the
kind
of
conscience
that
obeys
such
choices
at
best
he
opens
the
book
and
yawns
and
shuts
it
he
may
look
about
him
for
any
distraction
rather
than
this
book
he
reads
through
a
country
newspaper
beginning
and
ending
with
the
advertisements
he
looks
at
every
picture
in
an
illustrated
magazine
he
looks
out
of
the
window
for
some
temptation
he
takes
down
or
humphry
ward
s
from
the
landlord
s
shelves
he
looks
through
the
magazine
again
if
he
opens
the
choice
book
he
finds
in
it
an
irresistible
command
to
go
to
bed
at
nine
o
clock
the
same
book
may
be
taken
out
thus
a
score
of
times
and
acquire
a
friendly
and
appearance
chapter
ix
seventh
day
streatley
to
sparsholt
on
the
ridgeway
by
scutchamer
knob
and
letcombe
castle
when
i
was
next
at
streatley
i
took
the
ridgeway
westward
chiefly
because
i
like
the
ridgeway
partly
because
i
wished
to
see
it
again
now
that
it
had
to
give
up
the
title
conferred
on
it
by
bishop
bennet
of
the
icknield
way
i
went
up
from
the
bridge
and
at
the
bull
turned
to
the
right
and
northward
along
the
wantage
road
which
is
probably
the
icknield
way
after
getting
well
up
on
the
chalk
above
the
river
this
road
maintains
the
same
level
of
from
two
to
three
hundred
feet
and
for
two
miles
keeps
within
a
mile
of
the
river
on
a
terrace
up
the
slope
of
the
hills
streatley
had
spread
itself
in
red
spots
along
the
side
of
the
road
past
the
fork
to
wallingford
and
up
to
where
the
ridgeway
turns
off
to
the
left
and
westward
into
the
long
coombe
leading
to
streatley
warren
at
its
mouth
this
coombe
was
wide
and
shallow
and
was
all
grass
except
on
the
left
hand
where
there
were
new
houses
in
places
as
by
rectory
farm
the
road
a
hard
one
had
a
pleasant
green
terrace
above
it
with
wild
roses
rambling
over
it
the
coombe
deepened
and
the
road
ascended
above
a
golf
course
near
warren
farm
thus
far
it
was
hedged
but
soon
still
mounting
the
right
wall
of
the
long
coombe
it
was
rough
and
hedgeless
and
old
parallel
tracks
were
to
be
seen
above
and
below
it
it
was
now
near
the
southern
edge
of
thurle
down
woods
on
its
right
below
on
the
left
were
the
steep
walls
of
the
winding
coombe
dotted
by
thorn
juniper
and
elder
and
here
called
streatley
warren
of
the
unwooded
coombes
or
inlets
into
the
downs
this
is
one
of
the
most
pleasing
to
me
and
i
shall
always
remember
it
as
i
do
the
great
coombe
winding
into
butser
hill
on
the
north
side
and
others
of
those
vast
turf
halls
which
the
sky
roofs
as
it
passed
the
head
of
the
coombe
the
road
was
six
hundred
feet
up
going
a
little
north
of
westwards
between
sheep
on
the
left
and
corn
on
the
right
it
was
two
or
three
miles
or
more
from
the
villages
on
the
north
moulsford
cholsey
the
astons
and
blewbury
and
two
or
three
hundred
feet
above
them
it
was
almost
as
far
away
from
the
wantage
road
and
as
far
above
it
the
villages
on
the
south
were
nearer
but
not
within
a
mile
aldworth
the
comptons
and
east
ilsley
it
gained
a
hedge
near
warren
farm
but
was
a
rough
way
now
wide
now
narrow
among
the
hazel
brier
elder
and
nettle
sometimes
there
was
an
ash
in
the
hedge
and
once
a
line
of
spindly
elms
followed
it
round
a
curve
it
was
high
but
not
yet
free
among
these
hedges
then
it
descended
deeply
worn
and
rough
to
where
a
signpost
marked
roads
to
aldworth
and
compton
on
the
left
cholsey
and
wallingford
on
the
right
then
all
was
open
country
mostly
turf
carved
by
many
trackways
and
with
trees
as
a
rule
only
to
shelter
the
thatched
solitary
and
barns
or
to
make
a
clump
and
landmark
at
a
summit
where
there
was
a
tumulus
as
on
churn
hill
the
road
was
scattered
in
pieces
over
the
open
turf
among
thorn
bushes
and
alongside
a
scotch
fir
clump
as
it
went
down
towards
churn
station
these
tracks
were
green
with
a
central
white
one
and
that
had
green
banks
and
a
few
thorns
on
reaching
the
road
from
moulsford
to
east
ilsley
my
way
seemed
to
be
continued
by
one
passing
chance
farm
and
keeping
on
the
north
side
of
the
hills
through
an
uninhabited
hollow
among
downs
which
are
bare
of
everything
but
grass
churn
railway
station
and
a
farm
except
when
dotted
with
soldiers
tents
but
there
was
now
a
little
to
the
south
of
this
a
clear
and
unbroken
high
ridge
extending
westwards
into
wiltshire
and
this
the
ridgeway
undoubtedly
followed
only
the
connection
between
my
way
over
roden
downs
and
the
higher
ridge
was
no
longer
a
direct
one
the
connecting
road
was
that
from
moulsford
to
ilsley
and
along
it
i
had
to
turn
round
west
and
even
south
to
gain
the
ridge
where
the
ridgeway
left
it
at
right
angles
to
go
hedges
no
longer
bounded
either
side
of
the
broad
turf
track
it
was
as
free
as
the
blue
paths
in
the
snowy
heavens
it
looked
down
upon
everything
but
the
clouds
and
not
seldom
on
them
in
the
early
morning
or
in
rain
on
its
left
the
downward
slope
was
broken
and
very
gradual
so
that
it
was
far
rarer
to
see
a
church
tower
like
ilsley
within
a
mile
than
a
ridge
of
woods
five
miles
off
or
a
bare
range
that
might
be
twenty
it
was
already
higher
than
the
icknield
way
at
telegraph
hill
it
had
climbed
out
of
choice
and
it
would
descend
only
of
necessity
on
its
right
the
slope
was
far
steeper
and
sometimes
a
little
way
from
the
foot
lay
the
villages
sometimes
the
land
rose
again
in
several
rolls
this
way
and
that
and
the
nearest
village
would
be
beyond
the
last
of
them
three
or
four
miles
away
either
corn
or
pure
turf
and
scattered
furze
lay
about
the
road
one
piece
of
furze
was
called
poor
s
furze
and
what
is
more
the
poor
were
gathering
it
for
fuel
though
it
was
midsummer
tall
rye
came
up
to
the
edge
of
it
illustration
ridgeway
near
streatley
now
the
ridgeway
had
risen
up
to
its
perfect
freedom
away
from
the
river
and
the
low
land
from
the
glaring
roads
and
the
collections
of
houses
this
way
men
of
old
came
of
necessity
yet
i
found
it
hard
not
to
think
now
that
the
road
was
thus
climbing
to
heights
of
speculation
to
places
suited
for
exploring
the
ridges
and
solitudes
of
the
spirit
it
seemed
in
one
mood
a
hermit
road
going
out
into
the
wilderness
to
meditate
and
be
in
lifelong
retirement
in
another
mood
a
road
for
the
young
eager
warrior
or
reformer
going
up
and
away
for
a
time
from
cloying
companions
to
renew
his
mighty
youth
i
saw
however
more
racehorses
than
confirmed
hermits
or
aspiring
warriors
or
reformers
before
it
was
ordained
that
cricket
should
be
played
on
billiard
tables
there
were
a
pitch
and
a
pavilion
here
beside
the
ridgeway
near
the
abingdon
road
elevens
drove
up
from
oxford
and
a
cheerful
scene
it
was
albeit
nobody
s
fortune
was
made
it
was
too
good
and
rustic
a
custom
not
to
decay
after
that
they
say
the
pavilion
became
an
rendezvous
for
men
with
lurchers
after
the
hares
a
refuge
for
belated
soldiers
a
convenience
for
several
breeds
of
idlers
philosophers
and
adventurers
these
it
was
decided
to
centralize
as
much
as
possible
in
prisons
workhouses
lunatic
asylums
cemeteries
town
rookeries
and
the
like
the
pavilion
thus
became
useless
and
was
pulled
down
nevertheless
there
it
is
still
very
clear
in
a
number
of
aging
heads
so
far
as
i
could
learn
it
was
the
nearest
approach
to
a
permanent
hermitage
on
the
ridge
of
these
downs
in
their
season
there
are
shepherds
shelters
and
caravans
for
the
men
or
for
persons
engaged
in

wayland
s
smithy
suppose
a
philosopher
were
to
live
in
and
about
these
old
stones
for
a
year
or
two
he
might
be
quite
undisturbed
then
he
would
be
arrested
on
suspicion
after
some
crime
a
ploughman
would
reveal
that
he
had
seen
the
man
about
it
would
reach
a
pressman
with
a
camera
he
would
get
somebody
to
pose
either
in
wayland
s
smithy
or
a
similar
place
at
wimbledon
or
balham
a
column
about
the
simple
life
would
be
printed
in
a
newspaper
illustrated
by
these
photographs
by
this
time
the
real
philosopher
a
hairy
and
uncommunicative
man
would
have
been
released
a
rival
pressman
would
travel
to
wantage
road
with
a
ticket
which
he
would
call
either
second
or
first
class
in
his
list
of
expenses
he
would
assail
the
philosopher
and
with
as
much
grace
as
is
compatible
with
haste
and
a
preoccupied
mind
would
bid
him
describe
his
experiences
in
answer
to
leading
questions
the
philosopher
might
possibly
fail
to
understand
the
pressman
s
object
or
even
his
english
he
might
seem
to
refuse
then
the
other
would
produce
his
card
claiming
instant
attention
as
the
representative
of
both
the
and
the
this
would
amuse
puzzle
or
infuriate
the
hairy
man
his
laughter
or
his
anger
would
be
mistaken
for
rudeness
the
pressman
would
return
to
wantage
road
and
in
the
train
invent
far
better
things
than
ever
were
on
sea
or
land
and
he
would
have
no
difficulty
in
illustrating
his
article
by
photographs
which
the
philosopher
would
never
see
but
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
would
see
then
boys
would
go
up
on
a
sunday
afternoon
and
stare
and
perhaps
trample
down
the
wheat
a
town
councillor
or
a
retired
missionary
or
other
man
of
culture
would
inspect
the
scene
in
the
philosopher
s
absence
it
would
be
discovered
that
wayland
s
smithy
was
undrained
and
improperly
ventilated
a
woman
would
be
scared
at
a
distant
view
of
the
philosopher
it
would
be
time
for
something
to
be
done
then
one
of
two
things
would
happen
either
the
man
would
disappear
as
quietly
as
mist
or
as
last
year
s
books
or
he
would
be
told
to
go
roused
to
eloquence
or
violence
arrested
and
imprisoned
and
his
story
told
in
twenty
lines
in
the
local
papers
from
time
to
time
the
police
of
neighbouring
counties
would
torment
him
until
at
last
he
could
be
certified
as
a
lunatic
instead
of
giving
him
a
large
plate
of
ham
and
eggs
followed
by
apple
dumplings
and
then
prussic
acid
they
would
shut
him
up
for
ever
in
a
building
with
innumerable
windows
from
any
of
which
he
could
look
out
and
see
lunatics
nevertheless
he
would
have
had
that
one
year
unmolested
at
wayland
s
smithy
this
however
is
only
a
possibility
comparatively
picturesque
the
real
thing
was
less
amusing
and
the
scene
of
it
was
not
wayland
s
smithy
but
lone
barn
that
winter
a
man
might
have
picked
up
the
paper
after
breakfast
and
found
descriptions
of
funerals
and
marriages
the
presentation
to
the
local
member
of
parliament
the
successful
meeting
of
his
rival
the
list
of
hunting
appointments
and
a
column
and
a
half
headed
suffering
children
parental
neglect
queer
defence
severe
sentences
magistrate
s
scathing
a
capital
presiding
the
bench
had
given
four
months
hard
labour
to
a
man
and
wife
for
neglecting
their
seven
young
children
in
such
a
way
as
to
cause
them
unnecessary
suffering
and
injury
to
their
having
scorched
his
back
parts
the
reader
would
turn
his
front
parts
to
the
fire
and
read
on
these
nine
had
been
living
for
some
weeks
at
lone
barn
which
lies
unexpectedly
in
a
small
hollow
at
one
of
the
highest
points
of
the
downs
three
miles
from
the
nearest
hamlet
it
had
long
been
deserted
the
was
ruinous
and
a
fox
taking
refuge
there
could
not
be
dislodged
from
the
fallen
masonry
and
elder
and
yew
tree
roots
the
hunters
had
noticed
nothing
in
the
barn
i
knew
the
and
had
often
wondered
about
the
man
who
built
it
in
that
solitude
somewhere
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
had
walls
of
unusual
thickness
such
as
could
not
have
been
overthrown
simply
by
time
and
weather
it
must
long
have
been
empty
and
subject
to
the
hostility
of
discontented
spirits
such
as
probably
infest
a
house
as
they
do
a
man
left
utterly
alone
i
had
not
suspected
that
anybody
was
living
in
the
barn
but
i
remember
a
pale
shuffling
man
carrying
a
child
who
begged
from
me
monotonously
as
i
came
down
the
hill
in
mist
a
little
before
dark
i
had
given
him
something
without
exactly
realizing
that
he
was
a
man
so
frail
subdued
and
had
he
been
a
creation
of
the
mist
quite
in
harmony
with
the
hour
this
was
probably
arthur
aubrey
bishopstone
who
was
now
in
prison
he
and
his
wife
and
six
children
had
arrived
at
the
barn
on
christmas
eve
for
a
week
before
they
had
been
at
a
barn
nearer
the
village
but
as
this
had
to
be
repaired
they
were
turned
out
they
were
allowed
to
settle
in
lone
barn
because
bishopstone
had
done
an
occasional
day
s
work
for
the
farmer
on
whose
land
it
stood
during
january
and
february
he
did
several
more
days
work
the
wife
and
children
remained
in
the
barn
the
two
eldest
had
measles
the
sixth
had
pneumonia
all
were
verminous
on
christmas
day
a
seventh
had
been
born
in
lone
barn
the
mother
who
had
fainted
in
court
a
week
before
and
had
been
remanded
pleaded
guilty
of
neglect
but
said
that
she
could
not
do
in
a
barn
as
she
could
in
a
cottage
there
being
no
bed
no
furniture
and
no
water
except
from
a
cattle
pond
half
a
mile
away
the
man
had
been
unable
to
get
a
cottage
the
family
had
been
found
lying
round
a
fire
in
the
barn
and
after
medical
examination
arrested
bishopstone
hardly
spoke
in
answer
to
the
questions
and
insults
of
the
bench
but
he
was
understood
to
say
the
lord
is
on
my
side
and
several
other
blasphemous
or
unintelligible
things
which
were
no
defence
or
excuse
the
nine
were
now
condemned
to
the
comfort
of
the
workhouse
and
the
prison
until
haymaking
time
i
went
to
lone
barn
again
the
birthplace
of
francis
albert
edward
bishopstone
the
black
brook
full
of
the
white
reflections
of
its
snowy
banks
and
beginning
to
steam
in
the
sun
was
hourly
growing
and
coiling
all
its
long
loops
joyously
through
the
land
the
dabchick
was
laughing
its
long
shrill
titter
under
the
alder
roots
faint
soft
shadows
fell
on
to
the
snow
from
the
oaks
whose
grey
skeletons
were
outlined
in
snow
against
the
clear
deep
blue
of
the
now
dazzling
sky
thrushes
were
beginning
to
sing
as
if
it
had
always
been
warm
and
bright
in
hedge
and
thicket
and
tall
wood
myriads
of
drops
were
falling
and
singing
in
the
still
air
against
the
south
the
smooth
downs
were
white
under
a
diaphanous
haze
of
grey
and
upon
them
seemed
to
rest
heavenly
white
mountains
very
still
and
gently
luminous
lone
barn
lay
up
in
the
haze
invisible
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
the
land
was
divided
by
low
hedges
into
broad
fields
there
no
birds
sang
and
no
stream
gurgled
the
air
was
full
of
the
pitiful
cries
of
young
lambs
at
their
staggering
play
in
the
shallow
snow
one
ewe
stood
with
her
lamb
in
a
stamped
muddy
circle
tinged
with
blood
amidst
the
pure
white
the
lamb
was
yellowish
green
in
colour
it
stumbled
at
her
teats
fell
down
and
sucked
upon
its
knees
the
big
mother
stood
still
shaggy
stubborn
meek
with
her
head
down
her
eyes
upon
me
her
whole
nature
upon
the
lamb
buried
in
her
wool
part
of
her
the
hill
was
hedgeless
save
where
a
narrow
ancient
road
deeply
trenched
it
in
ascending
curves
lined
by
thorns
the
road
had
probably
not
been
trodden
since
that
procession
of
ten
had
descended
towards
the
town
six
miles
away
a
kestrel
had
killed
a
upon
the
bank
and
as
i
approached
it
sailed
away
from
the
circle
of
feathers
on
the
snow
but
the
wind
had
been
the
chief
inhabitant
of
the
slopes
and
unseen
of
mortal
eyes
it
had
been
luxuriously
playfully
carving
the
snow
which
submerged
the
hedge
the
curved
in
the
drift
deeply
ploughed
or
deliberately
chiselled
remained
in
the
stillness
as
a
record
of
the
pure
joy
of
free
active
life
contented
with
itself
it
was
the
same
blithe
hand
which
had
shaped
the
infant
born
in
this
black
barn
an
old
plum
tree
planted
when
barn
and
house
were
built
and
now
dead
and
barkless
stood
against
one
end
and
up
it
had
climbed
a
thick
ivy
stem
that
linked
barn
and
tree
inseparably
with
a
profusion
of
foliage
emerald
and
white
the
last
of
its
doors
lay
just
outside
in
the
dead
embers
of
the
tramps
fire
thus
open
on
both
sides
to
the
and
the
air
the
barn
looked
the
work
rather
of
nature
than
of
man
the
old
thatch
was
grooved
riddled
and
gapped
and
resembled
a
grassy
bank
that
has
been
under
a
flood
the
winter
through
covered
now
in
snow
it
had
the
outlines
in
miniature
of
the
hill
on
which
it
was
built
the
patched
walls
originally
of
tarred
timber
laid
in
horizontal
planks
were
of
every
hue
of
green
and
yellow
that
moss
lichen
and
mould
can
bestow
each
strip
of
board
being
of
a
different
date
and
a
different
shade
what
gave
them
something
in
common
with
one
another
was
the
fresh
black
stains
which
ran
from
the
melting
eaves
to
the
below
the
porches
lofty
enough
to
admit
a
waggon
piled
as
high
as
possible
with
sheaves
of
corn
had
slipped
somewhat
away
it
was
to
them
alone
that
the
exterior
of
the
building
owed
a
faint
suggestion
of
a
church
and
consequently
a
pathetic
undermined
dignity
without
them
it
would
have
seemed
wholly
restored
to
nature
amiably
and
submissively
ruinous
with
a
silence
in
which
not
the
most
perverse
mind
could
have
detected
melancholy
but
within
it
was
unexpectedly
lofty
and
the
ponderous
open
and
naturally
curved
was
obviously
performing
too
efficiently
the
task
of
supporting
the
roof
it
at
once
inspired
the
thought
that
it
should
ere
now
have
relaxed
the
strain
of
its
crooked
arms
and
acquiesced
and
slipped
or
collapsed
the
oak
floor
was
pierced
in
many
places
by
wear
and
by
drippings
from
the
broken
roof
grass
and
corn
had
grown
up
through
the
crevices
and
died
some
of
the
fallen
thatch
had
been
piled
in
a
dry
corner
for
a
bed
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
was
another
sign
of
its
late
use
squares
chalked
by
the
children
for
the
playing
of
a
game
i
walked
to
and
fro
there
were
no
ghosts
or
so
it
seemed
a
starved
thrush
lay
dead
in
a
corner
that
was
all
i
stirred
the
bed
with
my
stick
meaning
to
set
fire
to
it
an
old
coat
was
concealed
beneath
it
and
out
of
the
pocket
fell
a
book
on
the
front
page
was
written
a
bishopstone
college
oxford
october
the
first
pages
were
filled
with
accounts
of
expenditure
subscriptions
purchases
the
items
abbreviated
as
a
rule
beyond
recognition
apparently
he
had
soon
ceased
to
keep
accounts
several
pages
were
torn
out
and
a
mere
few
left
only
to
save
their
other
halves
farther
on
the
book
had
then
begun
to
serve
another
purpose
under
the
date
march
there
was
a
list
of
books
read
during
the
term
ending
in
that
month
letters
of
gilchrist
s
he
had
meant
to
make
a
comment
on
this
reading
perhaps
but
it
was
crossed
out
deliberately
lest
he
should
be
tempted
to
decipher
the
hateful
thing
he
had
left
only
the
words
it
is
a
mistake
to
leave
comments
of
this
kind
on
record
as
in
after
years
one
is
unable
to
get
back
at
their
meaning
and
the
imperfectly
expressive
words
are
irritating
and
humiliate
the
mere
names
of
books
read
people
seen
places
walked
to
and
the
like
are
more
eloquent
far
this
day
i
have
burnt
my
old
diaries
they
help
the
past
to
haunt
us
out
of
its
consequently
there
were
from
time
to
time
carelessly
written
jottings
of
names
of
books
lists
of
places
visited
with
dates
they
were
eloquent
enough
on
some
pages
short
poems
and
passages
of
prose
were
copied
out
in
a
very
neat
hand
showing
a
kind
of
priestly
sense
of
reverence
for
claudian
s
poem
the
etc
these
entries
needed
no
comment
the
serious
worship
implied
in
the
caligraphy
was
unmistakable
bishopstone
would
have
no
difficulty
in
recalling
to
his
mind
the
mood
in
which
they
were
copied
out
they
were
headed
usually
by
no
more
than
the
year
in
which
they
were
written
down
sometimes
not
at
all
thus
he
wrote
at
the
head
of
a
page
and
apparently
added
nothing
for
it
was
in
an
altered
hand
that
the
prayer
from
shelley
was
copied
make
me
thy
lyre
even
as
the
forest
is
next
in
march
of
the
same
year
he
had
written
down
perhaps
from
dictation
the
names
of
historical
books
with
a
few
words
showing
that
in
the
following
summer
he
would
have
to
go
up
for
the
examination
which
had
qualified
him
for
a
degree
evidently
he
was
resolved
to
work
hard
at
special
books
and
to
put
behind
him
the
intellectual
luxuries
of
rabelais
etc
whether
he
read
too
hard
or
not
is
uncertain
but
the
entry
for
september
of
that
year
was
merely
brain
fever
and
a
class
i
am
now
the
next
entry
was
in
sell
all
thou
hast
and
follow
in
the
same
year
came
the
words
i
possess
my
working
clothes
and
a
greek
testament
i
earn
a
there
was
no
more
for
that
year
but
under
were
a
number
of
detached
thoughts
such
as
all
men
are
equal
is
only
a
corollary
of
all
men
are
different
if
only
the
former
had
been
forgot
instead
of
latter
it
might
have
changed
things
less
and
forgive
we
one
another
for
we
know
not
what
we
do
each
man
suffers
for
the
whole
world
and
the
whole
world
for
each
man
there
is
little
distinction
between
the
destinies
of
one
man
and
another
if
this
is
understood
let
us
not
exalt
worldly
distinctions
titles
by
saying
that
they
make
no
in
came
the
words
east
anglia
the
fens
yorkshire
the
lakes
and
the
isolated
thought
to
be
alone
in
eternity
is
the
human
lot
of
a
man
but
to
be
alone
in
time
alas
alas
the
next
year
he
had
not
touched
the
book
it
was
the
year
of
his
marriage
for
in
he
had
written
we
have
now
been
married
one
a
list
of
villages
followed
showing
a
zigzag
course
right
across
england
then
the
thought
there
is
nothing
like
the
solitude
of
another
soul
to
teach
us
our
own
two
hungers
two
thirsts
two
solitudes
begetting
was
it
perhaps
at
the
birth
of
a
child
the
date
is
not
given
it
might
have
been
the
same
year
that
he
wrote
this
to
him
who
is
born
into
eternity
it
matters
little
what
happens
in
time
and
a
generation
of
pain
is
as
the
falling
of
a
then
unhappiness
is
apart
from
pain
when
they
tell
us
that
in
the
middle
ages
and
even
in
the
last
century
men
suffered
more
pain
and
discomfort
than
we
they
do
not
tell
us
that
they
also
had
less
unhappiness
many
a
battlefield
has
seen
more
joy
than
pain
many
a
festival
as
little
of
and
then
on
a
page
to
itself
we
are
looking
for
straight
oak
sticks
in
a
world
where
it
is
hazel
that
grows
that
he
was
still
travelling
was
indicated
only
by
names
of
places
written
down
without
comment
a
week
s
accounts
showed
the
expenditure
of
on
the

nothing

not

of

are
the

called

then
why
should
i
have
a

unless
indeed
there
were
a

which
described
me
as

describes
an

belonged
to
the

which
he
spent
in
the
barn
on
christmas
eve
life
will
never
be
better
or
nobler
nor
has
ever
been
than
here
at
this
instant
in
my
breast
but
may
i
never
be
content
to
know
it
lest
and
and
be
the
less
for
then
what
is
man
one
moment
he
is
a
prayer
another
a
flower
of
god
another
a
flame
to
consume
he
knows
not
what
save
that
it
is
himself
and
again
he
is
but
a
dungeon
in
which
an
infant
s
cry
is
echoing
one
day
i
saw
soldiers
and
i
was
nothing
but
as
it
were
a
to
record
the
clattering
hoofs
the
scarlet
the
shattering
trumpet
the
children
have
a
doll
that
was
given
to
them
they
are
talking
to
it
and
about
it
as
i
talk
to
and
about
another
man
i
heard
the
wind
rustle
in
the
dead
leaves
this
morning
i
heard
it
rustle
over
my
grave
and
over
the
world
s
and
over
the
embers
of
all
the
stars
and
i
was
not
afraid
what
name
has
my
beautiful
barn
in
heaven
in
it
was
born
a
man
in
the
sight
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
god
has
told
me
my
seed
shall
be
multiplied
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
can
it
be
that
out
of
this
barn
will
grow
the
regeneration
of
the
world
or
will
the
forgotten
memory
of
it
trouble
the
of
some
citizen
far
hence
in
time
and
so
give
birth
to
a
flame
a
prayer
a
rose
out
of
the
soul
of
him
it
is
cold
yes
but
the
frost
is
one
of
the
angels
a
doctor
has
been
here
a
man
not
used
to
our
life
he
too
felt
that
it
was
cold
he
said
that
little
francis
whom
mary
calls
albert
edward
is
ill
and
may
die
if
he
does
then
it
may
be
from
the
corpse
of
an
infant
the
saviour
of
society
will
be
these
were
the
last
words
on
the
day
after
the
doctor
s
visit
the
arrest
was
made
arthur
aubrey
bishopstone
and
two
of
the
children
died
in
the
infirmary
of
the
prison
francis
albert
edward
born
at
lone
barn
on
christmas
day
recovered
from
the
effects
of
his
birth
and
left
the
workhouse
at
the
end
of
june
with
his
mother
and
four
brothers
i
believe
that
after
lone
barn
there
was
nothing
they
missed
less
than
arthur
aubrey
bishopstone
if
they
had
been
given
to
considering
such
matters
they
would
have
said
that
he
ought
to
have
lived
solitary
and
let
his
hair
grow
in
wayland
s
smithy
instead
of
marrying
and
begetting
seven
children
of
whom
only
two
were
able
to
die
in
infancy
lone
barn
has
since
been
burnt
to
the
ground
and
should
francis
albert
edward
his
real
name
or
the
world
visit
the
scene
of
his
nativity
to
worship
or
verify
the
facts
they
would
find
in
that
hollow
of
the
downs
only
a
square
space
of
nettles
poppies
and
bachelor
s
buttons
amidst
the
turf
coming
to
the
telegraph
posts
of
abingdon
lane
the
abingdon
and
newbury
road
the
turf
was
furrowed
this
way
and
that
gorse
and
thorn
surrounding
the
crossing
of
the
straight
white
road
and
the
green
way
made
a
frame
as
for
some
wayside
event
of
no
common
kind
such
as
the
birth
of
francis
but
the
sun
shone
and
the
wind
blew
and
betrayed
nothing
then
the
road
was
a
central
track
of
very
little
rutted
turf
and
flowers
and
long
grass
on
either
side
it
had
banks
but
no
thorns
growing
on
them
the
valley
was
beautiful
the
tedded
hay
looking
like
sea
sand
the
elms
very
dark
in
their
lines
or
masses
above
the
green
corn
the
villages
hidden
and
the
single
dim
among
trees
and
the
land
rising
beyond
to
a
ridge
saddled
here
and
there
with
dark
clumps
on
the
horizon
in
one
place
a
upland
of
newly
ploughed
chalk
was
almost
snowy
in
misty
whiteness
the
clouds
of
the
sky
and
the
hot
mist
of
earth
dimmed
the
pale
ploughland
and
the
corn
until
the
trees
appeared
to
be
floating
on
them
as
on
a
sea
they
were
cutting
hay
a
little
way
off
to
my
left
and
as
the
horses
and
the
came
into
sight
at
some
speed
it
seemed
to
me
that
but
for
the
seat
it
was
probably
much
like
a
british
war
chariot
to
the
right
the
slope
of
the
down
was
turf
sometimes
the
road
had
a
bank
on
each
side
sometimes
only
on
one
near
the
crossing
of
the
road
to
east
hendred
it
was
for
a
time
without
a
bank
in
other
places
the
ditch
was
clearer
than
the
bank
there
was
corn
with
its
poppies
white
campions
and
charlock
on
the
right
hay
on
the
left
woods
now
on
the
left
and
now
on
the
right
sometimes
touched
the
road
but
they
never
reached
it
from
both
sides
at
once
it
never
passed
through
a
wood
in
one
of
the
roadside
woods
on
the
left
a
great
tumulus
stood
disembowelled
among
the
beeches
this
was
scutchamer
knob
on
cuckhamsley
hill
or
as
i
have
heard
it
called
scotchman
s
this
name
an
old
carter
had
apparently
justified
to
himself
in
part
by
the
fact
that
an
old
road
coming
from
the
north
perchance
from
scotland
passes
close
by
namely
hungerford
lane
which
has
a
separate
existence
from
milton
hill
near
steventon
to
land
s
end
on
knoll
end
down
near
farnborough
above
lockinge
park
the
road
was
about
forty
yards
wide
of
level
turf
between
a
bank
and
fence
on
the
right
and
a
natural
low
wall
of
turf
above
it
on
the
left
but
the
new
reservoir
the
new
plantation
of
firs
and
their
iron
fences
at
this
point
might
have
persuaded
the
traveller
that
lockinge
park
was
going
to
absorb
the
ridgeway
as
it
did
the
icknield
way
two
centuries
ago
at
a
very
high
point
near
by
was
a
slender
white
column
and
cross
upon
a
mound
of
turf
erected
in
memory
of
robert
loyd
lindsay
baron
wantage
by
his
wife
the
road
went
lightly
away
from
this
over
the
bare
turf
having
on
its
left
the
thorny
slopes
of
yew
down
and
on
the
right
a
sunken
tumulus
several
deep
tracks
descended
towards
lockinge
and
at
a
tumulus
beyond
the
first
road
to
wantage
a
branch
entered
on
the
left
from
farnborough
exactly
like
the
main
track
if
it
can
be
called
a
branch
that
was
itself
a
parish
boundary
and
gave
its
course
to
the
main
track
for
some
distance
this
tumulus
formed
part
of
the
right
bank
of
the
ridgeway
i
noticed
that
i
seldom
did
more
than
glance
at
the
country
southward
on
my
left
the
steep
downward
slope
that
was
never
far
off
on
the
right
the
wide
vale
below
and
the
very
distant
hills
sometimes
visible
beyond
could
always
draw
my
eyes
from
the
south
on
that
side
there
was
a
beautiful
region
falling
and
then
rising
again
to
a
height
not
much
lower
than
the
ridgeway
and
crowned
with
trees
at
the
top
of
the
rise
as
beyond
fawley
there
were
several
rough
thorny
slopes
on
that
side
each
thorn
distinct
and
these
are
peculiarly
attractive
yet
i
could
not
look
at
them
long
it
was
the
same
when
i
walked
back
in
the
opposite
direction
the
vale
spread
out
in
the
north
was
satisfying
and
the
horizon
was
distant
enough
to
quiet
if
it
ever
awakened
desire
i
never
wished
to
descend
the
two
or
three
miles
of
country
visible
in
the
south
was
far
more
positively
attractive
as
well
as
by
chance
less
known
to
me
perhaps
the
horizon
was
too
near
and
was
soon
merely
tantalizing
certainly
it
gave
no
rest
also
the
land
fell
away
very
little
before
rising
again
to
this
horizon
and
consequently
gave
none
of
the
pleasure
of
a
low
and
as
it
were
subject
landscape
the
scene
awakened
desire
but
i
could
not
turn
aside
to
satisfy
it
therefore
perhaps
since
it
could
not
be
satisfied
and
stilled
as
by
the
distant
northern
horizon
i
turned
away
the
road
was
going
broad
and
green
and
straight
between
bare
banks
in
the
course
set
by
the
tributary
from
farnborough
when
suddenly
it
bent
to
the
south
for
a
few
yards
and
then
again
west
by
a
little
pond
under
some
willows
it
descended
much
narrowed
and
hedged
past
the
ash
trees
and
sycamores
of
white
house
and
then
with
a
sharp
northward
turn
along
the
wantage
road
and
in
a
few
yards
another
to
the
west
at
red
house
it
recovered
its
direction
and
presumably
its
original
course
probably
the
half
a
mile
or
more
between
the
two
crooks
is
not
an
innovation
but
the
crooks
themselves
are
as
it
were
the
punishment
inflicted
on
the
old
road
by
two
newer
or
at
some
time
more
vigorous
roads
cutting
across
it
illustration
letcombe
castle
beyond
red
house
i
passed
letcombe
castle
or
segsbury
camp
the
road
running
close
and
parallel
to
its
straight
south
side
a
road
crossed
mine
and
penetrated
the
green
ramparts
of
the
camp
from
a
farm
that
stood
with
a
thatched
barn
under
some
ash
trees
behind
it
a
grassy
down
with
clumps
beyond
the
road
was
now
so
broad
that
it
was
hardly
at
all
marked
except
downhill
or
where
a
crossway
roughened
it
or
at
some
busy
section
between
one
and
another
where
it
would
have
one
narrow
strip
at
the
turning
to
letcombe
bassett
stood
a
sycamore
and
some
ash
trees
and
there
were
roses
in
the
thorn
hedge
letcombe
bassett
was
at
the
foot
of
a
round
buttress
of
the
downs
called
gramp
s
hill
but
was
half
hidden
in
grouped
trees
which
continued
above
and
alongside
the
winding
white
road
to
letcombe
regis
a
mile
beyond
gramp
s
hill
and
the
next
and
far
more
prominent
hill
formed
between
them
a
long
deep
hollow
winding
up
into
the
hill
and
terraced
on
its
slopes
with
flights
of
green
steps
this
winding
made
almost
an
island
of
a
small
hill
round
and
and
the
top
of
this
hill
had
been
mown
and
a
waggon
in
the
centre
was
being
loaded
with
hay
here
was
the
place
to
build
a
castle
in
the
air
and
also
on
the
turf
of
the
downs
the
man
who
did
so
would
probably
inhabit
somewhat
longer
than
the
philosopher
did
wayland
s
smithy
he
might
live
there
even
until
he
died
but
it
is
not
likely
that
his
heir
supposing
that
he
had
an
heir
would
continue
after
him
in
any
case
it
would
at
once
be
called
the
clumps
of
trees
planted
on
high
places
to
please
the
eye
and
to
be
a
landmark
are
now
called
follies
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
any
house
built
high
or
in
a
great
solitude
is
likely
to
be
called
a
a
house
may
earn
the
name
by
having
walls
more
than
a
foot
thick
in
a
district
of
where
builders
are
bankrupt
once
a
month
thus
people
condemn
the
extraordinary
if
it
is
a
little
thing
like
a
white
blackbird
they
shoot
at
it
if
it
is
a
big
helpless
thing
like
a
whale
stranded
in
cornwall
they
carve
it
alive
but
to
call
it
a
folly
and
have
done
with
it
is
the
most
innocent
form
of
condemnation
in
fact
it
is
by
this
time
rather
venerably
pretty
they
call
the
clump
of
beeches
on
liddington
hill
the
folly
the
clump
a
of
wayland
s
smithy
is
odstone
folly
ashbury
folly
is
the
clump
at
the
crossing
over
the
ridgeway
down
to
ashbury
church
they
call
a
house
a
folly
with
less
benevolence
they
see
or
they
feel
in
the
strange
high
or
solitary
situation
part
of
an
attempt
to
mould
the
course
and
conditions
of
life
or
to
escape
from
them
they
see
or
they
dimly
imagine
a
being
who
is
trying
to
make
his
or
some
woman
s
like
a
poem
or
like
a
work
of
art
carved
with
figures
strange
and
sweet
all
made
out
of
the
carver
s
brain
it
is
not
that
they
see
the
blasphemy
of
it
like
that
of
babel
or
of
the
titans
but
they
know
that
the
builders
of
babel
and
the
titans
will
fail
and
if
they
can
not
beat
them
themselves
they
will
be
on
the
side
of
the
one
who
can
i
should
myself
be
sorry
to
see
a
house
such
a
one
as
is
likely
to
be
built
on
that
island
between
gramp
s
and
hackpen
hills
but
if
it
were
such
a
house
as
morgan
s
folly
i
warmed
with
the
thought
of
transporting
that
tower
to
this
peninsulated
table
of
turf
by
the
expenditure
of
a
sum
sufficient
to
have
given
a
free
library
to
letcombe
bassett
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
called
a
folly
but
there
was
a
plantation
at
the
from
sparsholt
to
lambourn
which
i
liked
a
long
narrow
plantation
of
beeches
close
together
alongside
the
and
touching
the
ridgeway
on
one
side
on
the
other
was
a
tumulus
here
it
was
a
broad
road
with
no
hedges
there
being
corn
on
the
right
and
sheep
enclosed
by
a
wire
fencing
on
the
left
it
was
now
near
its
highest
point
nearly
eight
hundred
feet
at
the
hill
barn
that
stands
with
its
company
of
stacks
amidst
a
group
of
ash
trees
above
sparsholt
the
purple
meadow
crane
was
growing
beside
the
road
near
hill
barn
i
left
the
ridgeway
that
morning
by
the
blowingstone
hill
and
its
woods
and
went
to
sparsholt
which
has
a
of
chestnut
and
lime
and
then
beech
and
elm
shadow
on
the
road
to
its
church
one
bee
was
buzzing
inside
as
i
walked
over
the
stones
and
brasses
of
the
floor
and
looked
at
the
commandments
the
creed
the
lord
s
prayer
and
the
royal
arms
on
the
wall
but
chiefly
at
three
recumbent
stone
effigies
lying
asleep
and
private
within
a
chapel
guarded

and
a

eighth
day
sparsholt
to
totterdown
on
the
ridgeway
by
white
horse
hill
and
wayland
s
smithy
i
was
going
through
sparsholt
the
next
day
just
after
the
children
had
gone
into
school
after
their
play
the
road
was
quieter
than
the
church
on
that
hot
bright
morning
as
i
walked
under
the
garden
trees
i
came
slowly
within
hearing
of
a
melody
played
so
lightly
or
so
far
lost
among
winds
or
leaves
that
i
could
hardly
distinguish
it
it
was
an
hour
when
nearly
everyone
is
at
work
a
poor
ragged
girl
was
walking
in
front
of
me
in
awkward
haste
but
she
stopped
at
the
same
time
as
i
did
to
listen
the
music
was
not
everything
the
shadow
and
the
filtered
light
the
silence
of
the
music
half
submerged
the
busy
hour
so
steeped
in
tranquillity
helped
the
player
to
express
perfect
carelessness
and
freedom
from
the
conditions
of
life
summer
wealth
luxury
happiness
youth
gaiety
innocence
and
benevolence
they
expressed
it
for
us
as
that
garden
picture
at
watlington
doubtless
expressed
it
for
others
but
presently
the
player
lighted
upon
a
melody
which
took
me
right
away
from
sparsholt
and
the
summer
morning
and
the
tranquillity
i
could
not
catch
every
note
but
even
the
fragmentary
skeleton
of
caradoc
s
hunt
could
not
be
mistaken
at
a
first
hearing
this
old
hunting
song
seemed
to
be
much
the
same
thing
as
scott
s
waken
lords
and
ladies
gay
and
little
more
than
the
north
countryman
s
one
morning
last
winter
to
holm
bank
there
came
a
noble
brave
sportsman
squire
sandys
was
his
name
illustration
white
horse
hill
many
have
heard
it
and
thought
it
just
one
of
the
best
perhaps
the
princeliest
of
hunting
songs
with
a
little
change
it
might
have
been
a
battle
song
for
it
was
martial
and
and
would
launch
cavalry
as
well
as
huntsmen
it
was
a
little
too
nervously
quick
and
dancing
for
a
battle
song
such
pace
such
height
of
spirit
could
not
endure
yet
the
trumpets
before
a
charge
have
often
brought
the
song
into
the
hearts
of
young
soldiers
and
their
chargers
and
they
have
done
extravagant
things
for
the
gay
tune
s
sake
it
suggested
the
haughtiness
and
celerity
of
youth
audacious
and
fantastic
pleasures
voices
of
command
and
laughter
and
all
splendid
dresses
neighing
and
prancing
horses
hounds
lazily
quarrelling
in
the
sun
gallant
march
weather
the
gates
of
a
castle
stood
all
wide
open
for
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
winter
and
arrowy
winds
and
humid
fragrance
were
invading
the
stale
shadows
as
the
first
flowers
break
out
of
the
old
dark
earth
so
the
youths
and
maidens
with
their
purple
and
gold
green
and
white
broke
out
of
this
old
dark
castle
upon
the
welsh
moorland
the
sharp
horseshoes
trampled
the
first
green
of
spring
and
the
first
yellow
blossoms
even
as
the
riders
would
trample
the
hearts
of
men
and
women
and
as
freely
upon
their
own
hearts
their
own
strength
and
health
and
happiness
the
sunlight
played
like
a
thousand
sprites
on
rippling
waters
on
the
gold
and
silver
ornaments
of
riders
and
horses
on
horns
of
gold
bright
as
the
sun
clear
as
the
west
wind
joyous
as
the
heart
of
man
and
hound
and
horse
sounded
the
horns
there
was
nothing
more
in
the
three
verses
there
seemed
little
more
in
the
melody
after
a
little
talk
and
much
laughter
and
shouting
with
deep
and
shrill
voices
blowing
of
horns
cheering
and
chiding
of
steeds
summoning
and
urging
of
hounds
they
rode
away
they
climbed
the
wild
hills
and
saw
an
angry
sea
of
yet
wilder
hills
in
the
distance
they
descended
into
the
rich
vales
they
scattered
joyfully
they
gathered
together
as
joyfully
they
feasted
until
better
than
any
wit
or
beauty
or
adventure
seemed
sleep
then
they
slept
other
listeners
to
the
song
might
think
rather
of
a
later
hunt
assembling
before
a
cheerful
georgian
mansion
with
many
windows
and
behind
one
of
them
a
lady
playing
caradoc
s
hunt
on
a
spinet
and
warbling
it
in
saxon
i
thought
of
such
a
one
as
i
heard
the
invisible
lady
playing
at
sparsholt
others
again
would
be
content
with
nothing
later
than
the
age
of
chivalry
and
the
the
hunters
would
all
be
auburn
or
young
men
they
are
clad
in
yellow
tunics
green
hose
and
shoes
of
leather
clasped
at
the
instep
with
gold
some
carry
bows
of
ivory
strung
with
deer
sinews
the
shafts
of
whalebone
headed
with
gold
and
winged
with
peacock
s
feathers
others
have
spears
of
coloured
azure
all
wear
and
daggers
and
horns
of
ivory
their
hunting
is
earnest
though
elaborated
with
much
decoration
of
custom
style
and
ceremony
they
are
men
who
must
go
hungry
but
for
the
chase
they
run
or
ride
to
hunt
the
stag
or
the
boar
and
nobly
beautiful
and
blithe
look
they
as
they
begin
to
move
away
from
the
castle
and
their
tall
brindled
greyhounds
wearing
collars
of
rubies
are
sporting
like
from
side
to
side
of
them
but
they
may
encounter
foes
instead
of
quarry
they
may
kill
or
be
killed
by
young
braves
from
other
borders
so
with
all
the
gallantry
of
dress
and
harping
there
is
something
grim
in
their
going
forth
nor
is
it
idle
bombast
for
one
among
them
to
ride
out
carrying
only
what
he
calls
the
mightiest
of
all
weapons
the
harp
on
which
he
plays
caradoc
s
hunt
at
the
starting
these
things
and
others
according
to
the
singer
and
the
hearer
the
song
readily
suggested
but
they
are
mistaken
who
are
contented
by
these
suggestions
sufficient
as
they
are
for
a
warm
summer
s
morning
in
a
green
lane
they
are
deceived
by
the
qualities
which
caradoc
s
hunt
has
in
common
with
other
hunting
songs
especially
by
the
galloping
rhythm
and
the
notes
like
a
challenge
of
horns
even
when
that
boastful
riding
harper
played
it
the
tune
was
old
he
was
a
bard
and
though
he
played
it
for
the
young
hunters
for
the
flashes
of
gaiety
and
mettle
upon
its
surface
it
intrigued
his
own
heart
with
a
rich
mystery
of
antiquity
already
legend
as
well
as
the
bards
and
harpers
had
begun
to
play
with
the
melody
it
was
said
for
example
to
have
been
the
favourite
hunting
song
of
the
lady
of
the
night
in
her
earthly
days
and
even
that
she
sang
it
or
had
it
sung
and
harped
to
her
now
that
she
was
an
inhabitant
of
night
and
the
underworld
solitary
benighted
peasants
or
travellers
saw
her
black
hair
streaming
over
her
green
vest
and
crimson
mantle
as
she
galloped
fiercely
over
the
mountains
or
in
the
heavens
her
horse
was
white
she
hallooed
as
she
rode
in
a
wild
voice
at
times
harsh
and
abrupt
like
a
heron
s
at
others
clear
and
laughing
like
a
s
the
hounds
streamed
after
her
howling
in
tumultuous
chorus
and
the
sound
grew
louder
as
the
pack
raced
farther
and
farther
away
they
were
the
hounds
of
the
underworld
they
followed
her
in
a
stream
or
fan
as
closely
as
if
the
foremost
held
the
tip
of
her
mantle
in
some
packs
the
hounds
were
small
and
were
white
all
over
except
the
shells
of
their
ears
which
were
and
they
had
eyes
like
lighted
pearls
some
were
black
with
red
spots
others
red
with
black
spots
there
were
also
hounds
all
with
eyes
of
flame
they
hunted
the
spirits
of
men
destined
to
die
soon
or
of
the
dead
who
were
unfit
either
for
heaven
or
for
hell
they
prophesied
deaths
and
calamity
however
fierce
they
were
always
even
frantically
joyous
but
some
thought
the
hallooing
of
the
lady
was
often
close
to
lamentation
only
when
the
sound
of
caradoc
s
hunt
was
heard
was
she
as
joyous
as
her
hounds
her
sadness
made
it
believed
in
places
that
she
was
no
huntress
at
all
but
the
quarry
or
at
least
that
she
hunted
for
a
punishment
that
she
was
doomed
by
god
or
devil
thus
to
flee
all
night
through
cloudland
or
the
most
desert
regions
of
earth
hunting
or
hunted
it
was
certain
that
she
was
powerless
to
change
her
fate
hunting
was
what
she
most
loved
on
earth
perhaps
she
still
loved
it
or
she
was
being
punished
for
the
crime
of
pride
or
immoderate
love
of
the
chase
one
story
was
that
she
had
been
very
beautiful
and
vain
of
her
beauty
and
on
her
had
exacted
a
promise
to
bury
her
in
her
most
radiant
apparel
another
story
more
venerable
was
that
she
had
so
loved
hunting
as
to
cry
out
once
in
a
strong
passion
i
care
nothing
for
heaven
if
i
can
not
hunt
when
she
died
therefore
her
spirit
was
cursed
with
an
everlasting
compulsion
to
slake
this
most
dear
desire
she
had
to
hunt
eternally
with
the
hounds
of
the
underworld
when
she
heard
caradoc
s
hunt
she
could
not
but
start
or
follow
the
chase
if
i
forget
caradoc
s
hunt
then
i
shall
be
dead
indeed
she
said
i
shall
be
quiet
and
sleepy
as
anyone
else
among
the
when
men
saw
her
dark
eyes
flashing
at
thought
of
the
song
they
could
not
believe
that
if
anything
of
this
beautiful
creature
was
to
survive
the
immortal
remnant
would
not
take
with
it
caradoc
s
she
heard
it
at
many
different
and
some
monstrous
times
people
thought
that
the
tune
was
in
her
head
but
she
averred
that
she
heard
it
outside
in
the
clouds
or
the
trees
or
the
hallooing
woods
and
her
immediate
attendants
knew
this
to
be
true
she
would
break
away
from
marriage
or
funeral
to
ride
she
would
suddenly
rise
up
from
mass
to
mount
she
would
dress
at
dead
of
night
uncouple
the
hounds
and
hunt
alone
love
wine
sleep
religion
were
impotent
against
the
melody
everyone
admitted
that
it
was
a
beautiful
melody
they
called
it
gay
or
spirited
or
said
that
it
was
perfectly
suitable
to
a
knightly
company
of
riders
this
lady
heard
it
and
rode
away
hers
was
not
the
fate
of
the
lord
of
radnor
castle
he
and
his
hounds
impiously
passed
the
night
in
the
church
of
near
builth
to
be
near
the
day
s
coverts
early
but
when
he
rose
at
the
dawn
he
found
himself
blinded
and
his
hounds
mad
so
that
he
escaped
only
with
difficulty
to
earn
pardon
by
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
the
lady
s
life
was
charmed
she
rode
anywhere
without
fear
she
died
young
but
it
was
in
bed
on
horseback
she
could
defy
man
or
god
such
was
the
lady
of
the
night
and
her
legend
was
at
least
not
unworthy
of
caradoc
s
but
as
the
belief
in
the
hounds
of
the
underworld
is
earlier
than
the
middle
ages
and
the
ghostly
hunter
in
darkness
more
venerable
than
the
norman
lady
so
is
the
tune
the
legend
might
have
grown
to
explain
the
tune
and
it
does
help
to
illuminate
the
depths
of
which
the
surviving
words
the
mere
cheerful
chivalry
are
no
more
than
the
glancing
surface
but
the
tune
has
depth
under
depth
and
when
it
is
heard
the
plummet
of
the
soul
sinks
to
a
profound
far
below
the
region
of
the
lady
who
rides
by
night
what
darkness
the
plummet
fathoms
what
bottom
of
the
monstrous
world
it
touches
is
not
to
be
understood
perhaps
the
mystery
is
only
that
which
at
once
haloes
and
enshrouds
common
things
when
we
no
longer
feel
them
as
common
but
if
at
the
sounding
of
the
melody
the
mind
s
eye
still
sees
a
cavalcade
of
antique
hunters
it
is
not
stag
or
boar
or
questing
beast
that
they
are
to
follow
the
castle
that
sends
them
out
of
its
gates
and
may
receive
them
at
nightfall
is
no
feudal
or
faery
stronghold
but
an
image
perhaps
of
the
great
world
itself
illustration
the
blowingstone
but
i
must
confess
the
melody
did
not
lighten
my
step
as
i
mounted
again
to
the
ridgeway
by
blowingstone
hill
the
blowingstone
is
a
block
of
brown
sarsen
stone
standing
on
end
and
of
such
a
height
that
a
man
can
bend
over
and
comfortably
blow
into
the
mouthpiece
at
the
upper
side
this
natural
mouthpiece
is
the
small
roundish
entrance
to
a
funnel
through
the
stone
which
emerges
at
a
larger
hole
lower
down
at
the
back
a
person
blowing
can
make
a
booming
that
is
said
even
now
to
carry
five
miles
if
sustained
for
some
time
at
the
where
it
stood
before
it
became
a
procurer
of
charity
a
skilled
and
hillman
might
have
made
himself
heard
much
farther
from
this
nearly
seven
hundred
feet
high
the
ridgeway
rises
to
its
greatest
height
hitherto
it
had
hardly
ever
had
higher
land
on
either
side
of
it
for
very
many
miles
at
uffington
castle
it
is
over
eight
hundred
feet
high
but
a
little
lower
than
the
highest
part
of
the
camp
from
the
rampart
about
this
circle
of
almost
level
turf
i
could
see
the
quarley
hill
range
and
far
over
the
lambourn
downs
to
martinsell
hill
by
savernake
i
could
see
barbury
castle
and
the
wooded
hills
of
clyffe
and
wroughton
and
badbury
the
cotswolds
the
oxfordshire
hills
sinodun
and
the
chilterns
the
dragon
hill
below
it
is
an
isolated
eminence
shaped
like
the
butt
of
an
oak
tree
and
similar
to
that
one
in
the
hollow
between
gramp
s
and
hackpen
hills
but
ruder
and
more
distinct
past
the
south
and
lower
side
of
uffington
castle
the
ridgeway
went
fairly
straight
with
a
thorn
or
two
on
either
side
towards
the
thick
beech
clump
above
wayland
s
smithy
sometimes
a
green
road
sometimes
worn
white
the
was
divided
among
charlock
and
different
greens
in
squares
and
triangles
and
here
and
there
a
thatched
barn
or
rick
at
a
corner
southward
i
saw
the
pleasant
dappled
scatter
of
knighton
bushes
over
the
turf
sometimes
considerable
woods
like
those
of
ashdown
by
alfred
s
castle
in
several
places
the
long
stretch
of
turf
reared
itself
up
with
beautiful
but
detached
hills
like
tower
hill
as
high
as
the
main
ridge
the
hot
misty
sun
drew
out
all
the
odour
from
uncut
grass
clover
cockscombs
yellow
bedstraw
daisies
and
bird
trefoil
and
the
light
air
mixed
them
whatever
was
visible
or
hid
on
the
left
the
road
always
commanded
the
northward
valley
the
main
expanse
and
also
for
the
most
part
the
nearer
land
where
the
villages
lay
close
to
the
foot
of
the
hills
on
which
it
was
travelling
an
enemy
might
have
lain
or
moved
concealed
within
a
very
short
distance
on
the
south
but
never
on
the
north
and
it
might
be
conjectured
therefore
that
attack
was
to
be
feared
from
that
side
only
and
that
the
other
was
friendly
country
to
those
most
commonly
upon
the
road
the
camps
of
lowbury
letcombe
and
uffington
were
all
to
northward
alfred
s
castle
alone
was
on
the
south
at
ashdown
among
the
greatest
woods
now
surviving
on
this
part
of
the
downs
it
is
hardly
possible
for
unhistorically
minded
men
to
think
of
war
on
these
hills
unless
troops
are
man≈ìuvring
over
them
yet
the
ridgeway
is
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
battlement
walk
of
superhuman
majesty
the
hills
between
streatley
and
liddington
form
a
curve
in
the
shape
of
a
bow
a
doubly
curved
cupid
s
bow
following
this
line
always
keeping
at
the
edge
of
the
steep
northward
slope
and
surveying
the
valley
the
ridgeway
carries
the
traveller
for
thirty
miles
as
if
along
the
battlements
of
a
castle
he
begins
at
streatley
by
having
the
early
morning
sun
of
spring
over
his
right
shoulder
the
full
light
of
midday
is
on
his
left
as
he
passes
letcombe
castle
the
sun
is
going
down
on
his
right
hand
as
he
descends
to
totterdown
and
the
pass
for
the
roman
road
and
modern
traffic
between
the
hills
it
is
still
debated
whether
most
or
little
of
the
downland
was
once
covered
with
trees
those
recently
planted
on
very
high
places
have
often
failed
to
make
more
than
a
spindly
and
ruinous
growth
as
at
chanctonbury
ring
liddington
hill
and
barbury
but
wherever
there
is
a
tertiary
deposit
beech
and
oak
not
to
speak
of
lesser
trees
abound
and
even
flourish
in
great
size
and
noble
forms
gorse
hawthorn
and
elder
rapidly
take
possession
anywhere
of
neglected
ground
and
make
an
impenetrable
scrub
yews
expand
and
beeches
grow
tall
and
close
on
steep
and
almost
precipitous
slopes
where
the
chalk
is
easily
bared
by
rain
traffic
or
rabbits
there
is
thus
some
reason
for
thinking
that
the
open
downland
is
largely
the
product
of
cultivation
and
nibbling
flocks
the
flocks
no
longer
feed
much
on
the
hills
and
except
when
folded
in
squares
of
turnips
or
mustard
are
seldom
seen
there
they
have
become
more
and
more
a
kind
of
living
machinery
for
turning
vegetables
into
mutton
and
only
in
their
lambhood
or
motherhood
are
they
obviously
of
a
different
tribe
from
etc
in
time
with
the
discovery
of
a
way
of
concentrating
food
and
sunlight
and
of
adapting
the
organs
of
the
sheep
to
these
essences
it
will
be
possible
to
dine
carnivorously
on
sunday
upon
what
was
grass
on

for

men
shall
sigh
for
lambs
born
filleted
with
a
double
portion
of
sweetbreads
from
uffington
castle
the
road
descended
slowly
and
reached
six
hundred
feet
at
the
wiltshire
border
a
third
of
a
mile
past
the
road
from
idstone
to
ashdown
then
gradually
it
rose
towards
a
point
much
above
seven
hundred
feet
between
two
distinct
breasts
of
down
in
places
it
had
a
good
hedge
of
thorn
maple
and
brier
on
one
side
at
others
only
isolated
little
thickets
of
thorn
brier
and

the

met
the

guelder
roses
once
at
a
corner
before
ridgeway

five
beeches
stood
together
making

the

point
showed
me
the
beeches
of
liddington
clump
each
stem
distinct
the
fall
of
clear
turf
down
to
the
plain
and
beyond
that
the
barbury
clump
and
the
long
down
wall
bending
to
avebury
the
ridgeway
was
now
rapidly
descending
with
a
disused
track
on
the
left
to
the
gap
where
the
roman
ermine
street
from
silchester
to
gloucester
now
the
swindon
and
hungerford
road
penetrated
the
hills
without
this
descent
from
its
ridge
the
road
must
have
turned
back
so
as
to
point
almost
to
streatley
again
and
it
would
have
done
this
to
avoid
only
about
a
mile
of
lowland
before
rising
again
to
the
hills
which
were
its
natural
soil
probably
it
did
so
rise
though
the
road
called
the
ridgeway
in
ordnance
maps
keeps
to
the
lowland
for
five
or
six
miles
i
crossed
ermine
street
at
totterdown
and
an
inn
called
shepherd
s
rest
and
the
ridgeway
became
a
hard
road
of
ordinary
width
between
hedges
and
ditches
it
was
more
like
the
icknield
way
than
the
ridgeway
and
still
greater
was
this
likeness
when
it
reached
liddington
but
made
no
effort
to
climb
again
to
the
ridges
or
to
keep
liddington
camp
on
its
north
side
one
road
does
climb
the
ridge
going
to
liddington
hill
and
then
south
having
turned
from
this
present
road
to
the
left
at
a
point
marked
by
the
ridgeway
bush
in
the
time
of
hoare
of
the
way
from
totterdown
to
the
swindon
road
but
the
ordnance
map
gives
the
name
of
ridgeway
to
a
road
going
straight
across
the
low
land
to
barbury
mounting
the
hill
on
the
north
side
of
that
camp
and
continuing
along
the
ridge
beyond
barbury
to
near
avebury
up
over
the
downs
again
to
the
avon
valley
up
to
salisbury
plain
and
across
it
perhaps
to
the
dorset
coast
or
skirting
it
to
warminster
and
the
west
but
the
site
of
ridgeway
bush
is
within
a
few
yards
of
the
westward
boundary
of
wanborough
and
beyond
wanborough
there
is
so
far
no
sufficient
evidence
for
tracing
the
course
of
the
icknield
way
the
two
roads
came
very
near
to
one
another
in
that
parish
they
may
even
have
touched
before
the
ridgeway
returned
to
its
own
place
high
up
and
it
is
possible
that
as
the
ridgeway
in
berkshire
has
been
mistakenly
called
the
icknield
way
so
the
lower
part
of
what
is
now
called
the
ridgeway
in
wiltshire
may
be
the
icknield
way

when
i
started
from
streatley
to
see
the
western
half
of
the
icknield
way
it
was
with
several
uncertainties
i
knew
that
the
icknield
way
was
not
the
ridgeway
but
a
lower
road
which
was
in
several
places
not
more
than
a
mile
or
two
away
from
it
this
lower
road
it
has
been
said
was
the
turnpike
for
part
at
least
of
its
course
one
writer
s
road
clearly
lay
south
of
this
turnpike
another
had
expressed
a
doubt
whether
it
was
the
turnpike
or
a
road
to
the
south
the
decision
that
the
icknield
way
in
berkshire
was
distinct
from
the
ridgeway
had
added
this
difficulty
that
the
ridgeway
supposing
it
to
have
come
up
from
the
ford
at
streatley
must
have
been
a
road
from
beyond
the
thames
and
what
that
road
was
i
had
not
discovered
though
it
had
been
suggested
that
it
was
the
upper
icknield
way
but
if
the
icknield
way
of
oxfordshire
and
the
icknield
way
of
berkshire
were
linked
it
must
have
been
at
streatley

it
may
also
have
been
at

a
little
past
the

the

becomes
separate
from

goes
westward
out
of
it
there
was
at

no
possibility
of
an
alternative
out

i
set
out
on
the

when
i
followed
the

i
saw
lyndhurst
bellevue
and

their
more
expensive

i
ignored
the

the
turning
up

of

and
went
on
upon
the

bordered
with

almost
at

the

crossed
the

running
up

into

those
woods
which
the
ridgeway
skirts

was
a
shallow
coombe
the
sides
dappled
with
thorns
the
bottom
covered
with
corn
and
in
the
midst
of
it
a
barn
called
well
barn
through
the
mouth
of
the
coombe
which
opened
towards
the
river
in
the

i
saw
the
pale
corn
and
the
dark
woods
above
it
of
the
chilterns
crossing
this
coombe
the
road
had
no
hedges
but
corn
on
both
sides
it
was
usually
hedgeless
but
banked
as
it
went
up
and
down
and
dipped
into
another
coombe
of
the
same
kind
called
moulsford

where
a
north
of
the
thirteenth

from

a

came
in

the
continuation
perhaps
of
a
track
from
the
icknield
way
near
ipsden
from
moulsford

the
main
road
went
visibly
curving
uphill

from

of
kingstanding
hill
at
three
hundred
feet
it
went
straight
between
its
low
hedges
and

had
still
corn
on

sides
in
stooks
downs
on
the
left
and
on
the
right
the
valley
of
dark
trees
stretching
far
away
into

it
was
a
plain
road
of
easy
gradients
no
corners
and
such
banks
or
hedges
that
anything
approaching
in
front
could
be
seen
it
lacked
the
company
of

wires
the
villages
of
aston
were
almost
completely
hidden
on
my
right
as
i
passed
within
a
third
of
a
mile
of
them
that
was
by
the
eleventh
milestone
from
wantage
and
there
the
road
was
following
along
and
under
one
of
the
low
natural
walls
of
chalk
which
so
often
guide
a
road
and
are
in
turn
defined
by
it
my
road
icknield
way
or
not
went
hedgeless
under
this
wall
with
oats
above
and
stubble
below
the
flowers
on
its
narrow
green
edges
were
chiefly
yellow
parsnip
and
white
carrot
both
dear
for
their
scents
and
succory
that
pale
blue
flower
which
a
strange
fate
has
closely
attached
to
the
coarsest
and
stiffest
of
dark
stems
and
placed
where
dust
is
likely
to
be
most
thick
here
the
dust
was
thick
and
i
was
glad
to
feel
to
hear
to
smell
and
to
taste
and
to
see
the
rain
falling
as
i
passed
the
barley
mow
at
blewbury
according
to
custom
i
stood
under
the
broad
overhanging
eaves
of
one
of
blewbury
s
thatched
roofs
and
watched
the
rain
but
it
was
better
to
be
in
it
and
to
smell
the
wetted
dust
which
association
alone
has
made
pleasant
any
road
was
good
now
though
mine
was
an
unadventurous
level
probably
commercial
road
but
rain
or
no
rain
i
was
looking
for
an
excuse
to
leave
this
road
at
upton
the
next
village
which
is
by
the
ninth
milestone
the
map
had
shown
me
a
road
or
an
almost
continuous
line
of
pieces
running
from
upton
westward
to
lockinge
park
and
on
the
east
possibly
connected
with
the
roads
i
had
already
travelled
between
little
stoke
and
upton
by
way
of
lollingdon
farm
aston
and
blewbury
but
traversing
land
near
upton
which
is
liable
to
floods
either
this
road
or
the
turnpike
was
the
icknield
way
because
a
more
northern
road
would
be
too
low
and
no
more
southern
one
had
left
any
traces
a
hundred
yards
or
so
before
the
road
i
was
on
bridged
the
didcot
newbury
and
southampton
railway
i
noticed
the
line
of
a
hedge
leaving
on
the
left
at
an
acute
angle
and
forming
a
triangle
with
the
railway
and
road
for
its
other
sides
as
an
old
road
is
not
likely
to
form
such
triangular
fields
except
with
the
help
of
a
new
branch
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
branching
hedge
marked
an
earlier
or
original
line
of
the
same
road
or
of
one
coming
from
upton
village
and
there
connected
with
the
field
roads
from
blewbury
and
aston
across
the
railway
another
hedge
and
a
depression
that
might
once
have
been
a
road
continued
this
line
and
led
naturally
into
a
lane
turning
out
of
the
main
road
on
the
left
beyond
the
bridge
and
passing
upton
vicarage
i
supposed
that
when
the
railway
cutting
was
made
to
have
left
these
crossing
roads
in
their
original
state
would
have
meant
making
two
bridges
or
one
very
broad
one
necessary
the
courses
therefore
were
slightly
altered
so
that
instead
of
a
crossing
or
way
there
was
a
road
receiving
a
branch
at
one
side
of
the
bridge
and
a
second
branch
from
an
opposite
direction
the
left
at
the
other
side
but
on
referring
to
the
old
ordnance
map
made
before
the
railway
i
found
that
i
was
mistaken
the
amended
crossing
may
have
been
made
when
the
old
road
was
superseded
by
the
turnpike
this
road
being
the
road
on
the
map
i
followed
it
especially
as
the
main
road
half
a
mile
beyond
by
the
horse
and
harrow
at
west
hagbourne
took
a
turn
which
suggested
a
piecing
together
of
two
older
roads
an
one
and
a
one
my
conjectural
road
began
as
a
hedged
lane
that
formed
a
short
cut
into
the
road
to
east
ilsley
and
newbury
crossing
that
road
it
was
a
cart
track
with
a
disused
parallel
course
on
the
right
over
hagbourne
hill
past
hagbourne
hill
farm
which
was
derelict
but
had
sunflowers
in
the
garden
and
ricks
in
the
yard
less
than
a
furlong
south
of
the
farm
is
a
supposed
roman
a
carter
told
me
that
the
first
part
of
the
road
as
far
as
the
crossing
was
baits
or
bates
lane
it
was
a
cart
track
or
usually
a
strip
of
three
or
four
parallel
cart
tracks
going
parallel
with
the
downs
and
almost
straight
between
one
road
and
the
next
that
came
from
over
the
downs
northward
to
the
villages
it
could
easily
make
a
straight
course
like
all
the
other
roads
round
about
because
it
was
on
an
almost
unbroken
plateau
of
cornland
at
the
foot
of
the
downs
so
level
was
this
piece
of
country
that
in
about
four
miles
the
altitudes
varied
only
between
three
hundred
and
eighty
and
four
hundred
feet
between
me
and
the
downs
there
were
seldom
any
trees
except
such
few
as
stood
by
downs
farm
its
thatched
barns
its
old
and
new
ricks
on
the
right
a
slight
swell
in
the
land
often
shut
out
everything
but
distant
oxfordshire
under
a
blue
bulging
threat
of
storm
the
road
was
for
the
most
part
without
hedges
and
not
a
parish
boundary
it
was
rarely
or
never
sunken
but
in
places
might
have
been
a
little
embanked
on
one
side
shortly
before
reaching
the
newbury
road
there
were
two
old
thorns
half
a
mile
farther
after
crossing
hungerford
lane
a
track
from
milton
hill
to
farnborough
it
had
a
line
of
elm
trees
on
its
left
which
was
part
of
the
enclosure
of
arfield
farm
close
by
i
thought
arfield
on
the
new
ordnance
maps
spelt
aldfield
might
be
the
same
as
halvehill
the
cottage
pronunciation
except
that
it
lacked
an
aspirate
was
not
discouraging
halvehill
barn
was
said
to
be
on
the
ickleton
street
or
meer
but
on
inquiry
i
learnt
that
it
was
some
way
from
my
road
down
hungerford
lane
to
the
north
but
on
this
side
of
the
main
road
which
was
here
about
a
mile
distant
this
barn
is
now
called
horn
down
barn
past
arfield
farm
the
road
had
hedges
until
it
came
to
the
tussocky
little
arfield
common
so
called
but
perhaps
not
so
in
fact
here
there
were
several
forking
cartways
mine
seemed
to
go
westward
along
the
northern
hedge
and
its
traveller
s
joy
but
at
the
west
side
of
the
common
where
cow
lane
comes
in
from
hendred
there
was
a
gap
of
a
hundred
yards
or
so
before
the
old
line
was
taken
up
by
a
road
from
the
which
led
me
into
the
road
to
east
hendred
this
was
a
little
more
than
three
miles
from
the
beginning
of
the
road
at
upton
illustration
east
hendred
as
i
had
had
as
much
rain
as
i
wanted
on
my
skin
i
turned
downhill
under
a
long
train
of
lombardy
poplars
and
very
lanky
ash
trees
into
east
hendred
for
the
night
it
was
a
thatched
village
built
on
the
slopes
of
a
little
valley
its
houses
standing
snugly
or
in
short
rows
high
above
either
side
of
the
steep
streets
they
stood
high
because
the
streets
were
very
old
and
worn
into
deep
hollows
and
at
the
edges
of
these
ran
narrow
cobbled
paths
but
the
cottages
were
still
higher
up
and
four
or
five
stone
steps
led
up
from
the
paths
to
their
doors
at
the
bottom
stood
the
towered
church
telling
the
hours
and
the
quarters
not
with
and
hands
but
with
bells
rain
however
drowned
that
sweet
noise
in
a
mightier
sweetness
heavy
and
straight
rain
and
no
wind
except
what
itself
created
for
half
an
hour
everything
trees
mud
walls
thatch
old
weatherboards
timbered
cottages
the
old
chapel
at
a
crossing
railed
off
as
a
sign
of
private
possession
everything
was
embedded
in
rain
every
sound
was
the
rain
for
example
i
thought
i
heard
bacon
frying
in
a
room
near
by
with
a
noise
almost
as
loud
as
the
pig
made
when
it
was
stuck
but
it
was
the
rain
pouring
steadily
off
the
inn
roof
then
in
the
dripping
quiet
afterwards
the
sunset
blazed
in
little
fragments
like
gorgeous
glass
and
metal
betwixt
the
black
garden
foliage
before
i
went
to
bed
an
intelligent
unprejudiced
man
told
me
that
the
i
had
followed
was
ickleton
street
or
he
said
it
with
some
shyness
ickleton
meer
i
had
asked
no
leading
questions
so
that
his
name
seemed
certainly
the
local
though
perhaps
not
invariable
one
from
his
description
and
map
knowledge
i
felt
no
doubt
that
this
was
the
road
mentioned
in
wise
s
of
as
ploughed
up
in
wantage
east
field
but
visible
from
lockinge
park
eastward
almost
the
whole
way
to
upton
through
the
parishes
of
ardington
east
hendred
harwell
and
west
hagbourne
it
is
strange
that
that
same
identification
was
not
made
in
a
book
published
in
i
mean
miss
eleanor
hayden
s
round
our
she
lived
at
west
hendred
yet
described
her
village
as
lying
between
two
roads
known
on
the
map
as
the
portway
the
main
road
between
wantage
and
reading
and
ickleton
street
adding
that
they
were
known
locally
as
the
turnpike
and
the
evidently
she
had
not
heard
the
people
talk
of
ickleton
street
or
ickleton
yet
her
books
prove
her
familiar
with
country
people
and
country
places
as
are
few
writers
of
country
books
her
and
her
and
of
the
gave
the
materials
for
an
exceptionally
full
picture
of
country
life
nothing
was
beneath
her
and
her
love
was
equal
to
her
curiosity
she
was
exceptionally
modest
and
put
down
everything
with
no
obvious
intention
except
fidelity
to
her
own
eyes
and
ears
she
could
be
dull
and
if
you
opened
the
book
at
random
you
might
be
disappointed
but
if
you
read
a
whole
chapter
you
were
certain
to
be
delighted
so
many
books
are
written
by
bungalow
countrymen
that
we
have
got
used
to
pretty
things
surprising
things
pathetic
things
country
equivalents
of
the
and
museums
of
towns
there
were
plenty
of
good
things
in
miss
hayden
s
books
she
was
not
afraid
of
quoting
country
talk
at
some
length
for
its
own
sake
but
she
did
not
miss
such
things
as
the
cottager
s
strutty
little
hen
who
was
a
deal
better

appeared
to
make
good
books
as
others

stockings
because
of
the
abundant
material
she
gave
a
natural
monotony
and
a
natural
charm
she
showed
us
a

curtseying

times
to
the

with
the

a

a

many

but
nobody
bought
her
books
if
she
had
given
them
to
some
journalist
to
mince

warm
and
dish
up
he
might
have
made
a
book
of
the
season
from
them
and
by
now
it
would
have
been
dead
hers
will
last
somehow
or
another
as
long
as
an
old
wall
i
lay
awake
listening
to
the
rain
and
at
first
it
was
as
pleasant
to
my
ear
and
my
mind
as
it
had
long
been
desired
but
before
i
fell
asleep
it
had
become
a
majestic
and
finally
a
terrible
thing
instead
of
a
sweet
sound
and
symbol
it
was
accusing
and
trying
me
and
passing
judgment
long
i
lay
still
under
the
sentence
listening
to
the
rain
and
then
at
last
listening
to
words
which
seemed
to
be
spoken
by
a
ghostly
double
beside
me
he
was
muttering
the
rain
puts
out
summer
like
a
torch
in
the
heavy
black
rain
falling
straight
from
invisible
dark
sky
to
invisible
dark
earth
the
heat
of
summer
is
annihilated
the
splendour
is
dead
the
summer
is
gone
the
midnight
rain
buries
it
away
where
it
has
buried
all
sound
but
its
own
i
am
alone
in
the
dark
still
night
and
my
ear
listens
to
the
rain
piping
in
the
gutters
and
roaring
softly
in
the
trees
of
the
world
even
so
will
the
rain
fall
darkly
upon
the
grass
over
the
grave
when
my
ears
can
hear
it
no
more
i
have
been
glad
of
the
sound
of
rain
and
wildly
sad
of
it
in
the
past
but
that
is
all
over
as
if
it
had
never
been
my
eye
is
dull
and
my
heart
beating
evenly
and
quietly
i
stir
neither
foot
nor
hand
i
shall
not
be
quieter
when
i
lie
under
the
wet
grass
and
the
rain
falls
and
i
of
less
account
than
the
grass
the
summer
is
gone
and
never
can
it
return
there
will
never
be
any
summer
any
more
and
i
am
weary
of
everything
i
stay
because
i
am
too
weak
to
go
i
crawl
on
because
it
is
easier
than
to
stop
i
put
my
face
to
the
window
there
is
nothing
out
there
but
the
blackness
and
sound
of
rain
neither
when
i
shut
my
eyes
can
i
see
anything
i
am
alone
once
i
heard
through
the
rain
a
bird
s
questioning
watery
cry
once
only
and
suddenly
it
seemed
content
and
the
solitary
note
brought
up
against
me
the
order
of
nature
all
its
beauty
exuberance
and
everlastingness
like
an
accusation
i
am
not
a
part
of
nature
i
am
alone
there
is
nothing
else
in
my
world
but
my
dead
heart
and
brain
within
me
and
the
rain
without
once
there
was
summer
and
a
great
heat
and
splendour
over
the
earth
terrified
me
and
asked
me
what
i
could
show
that
was
worthy
of
such
an
earth
it
smote
and
humiliated
me
yet
i
had
eyes
to
behold
it
and
i
prostrated
myself
and
by
adoration
made
myself
worthy
of
the
splendour
was
i
not
once
blind
to
the
splendour
because
there
was
something
within
me
equal
to
itself
what
was
it
love
a
name
a
word
less
than
the
watery
question
of
the
bird
out
in
the
rain
the
rain
has
drowned
the
splendour
everything
is
drowned
and
dead
all
that
was
once
lovely
and
alive
in
the
world
all
that
had
once
been
alive
and
was
memorable
though
dead
is
now
dung
for
a
future
that
is
infinitely
less
than
the
falling
dark
rain
for
a
moment
the
mind
s
eye
and
ear
pretend
to
see
and
hear
what
the
eye
and
ear
themselves
once
knew
with
delight
the
rain
denies
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
or
heard
and
there
never
was
memory
the
last
chord
of
the
lute
is
broken
the
rain
has
been
and
will
be
for
ever
over
the
earth
there
never
was
anything
but
the
dark
rain
beauty
and
strength
are
as
nothing
to
it
eyes
could
not
flash
in
it
i
have
been
lying
dreaming
until
now
and
now
i
have
awakened
and
there
is
still
nothing
but
the
rain
i
am
alone
the
unborn
is
not
more
weak
or
more
ignorant
and
like
the
unborn
i
wait
and
wait
knowing
neither
what
has
been
nor
what
is
to
come
because
of
the
rain
which
is
has
been
and
must
be
the
house
is
still
and
silent
and
those
small
noises
that
make
me
start
are
only
the
imagination
of
the
spirit
or
they
are
the
rain
there
is
only
the
rain
for
it
to
feed
on
and
to
crawl
in
the
rain
swallows
it
up
as
the
sea
does
its
own
foam
i
will
lie
still
and
stretch
out
my
body
and
close
my
eyes
my
breath
is
all
that
has
been
spared
by
the
rain
and
that
comes
softly
and
at
long
intervals
as
if
it
were
trying
to
hide
itself
from
the
rain
i
feel
that
i
am
so
little
i
have
crept
away
into
a
corner
and
been
forgotten
by
the
rain
all
else
has
perished
except
me
and
the
rain
there
is
no
room
for
anything
in
the
world
but
the
rain
it
alone
is
great
and
strong
it
alone
knows
joy
it
chants
monotonous
praise
of
the
order
of
nature
which
i
have
disobeyed
or
slipped
out
of
i
have
done
evilly
and
weakly
and
i
have
left
undone
fool
you
never
were
alive
lie
still
stretch
out
yourself
like
foam
on
a
wave
and
think
no
more
of
good
or
evil
there
was
no
good
and
no
evil
there
was
life
and
there
was
death
and
you
chose
now
there
is
neither
life
nor
death
but
only
the
rain
sleep
as
all
things
past
present
and
future
lie
still
and
sleep

the
rain
the
heavy
black
rain
falling
straight
through
the
air
that
was
once
a
sea
of
life
that
was
a
dream
only
the
truth
is
that
the
rain
falls
for
ever
and
i
am
melting
into
it
black
and
monotonously
sounding

the
midnight
and
solitude
of
the
rain

a
little
while

in
an
age

chapter
xii
tenth
day
east
hendred
to
wanborough
by
lockinge
park
wantage
ashbury
and
bishopstone
on
the
following
morning
early
i
returned
to
where
i
had
left
my
conjectured
road
which
i
shall
now
call
ickleton
street
at
the
crossing
half
a
mile
south
of
east
hendred
church
the
eastern
road
at
the
crossing
came
from
the
out
of
hungerford
lane
and
was
only
for
a
few
hundred
yards
in
the
line
of
ickleton
street
falling
into
it
a
hundred
yards
or
so
west
of
aldfield
common
where
i
had
lost
the
road
the
western
road
was
apparently
mine
but
it
was
so
unimportant
for
traffic
that
though
the
eastern
road
forked
on
entering
the
northern
or
hendred
road
neither
of
the
forks
ran
exactly
into
ickleton
street
between
these
forks
was
a
triangular
waste
of
yellow
parsnip
wild
carrot
and
dock
uneven
from
digging
and
somewhat
above
the
roads
which
were
sunken
by
downhill
wearing
ickleton
street
ran
for
a
third
of
a
mile
straight
westward
to
a
at
the
east
and
west
hendred
boundary
it
was
hedgeless
as
before
and
being
on
a
slight
depression
the
horizon
was
often
a
very
near
one
of
corn
topped
by
a
distant
bright
cloud
or
dark
clump
of
beech
at
this
i
had
to
turn
a
few
yards
south
and
then
westward
along
a
track
of
the
same
kind
not
being
sunk
or
raised
or
hedged
or
banked
or
ditched
the
road
could
be
ploughed
up
easily
and
its
course
slightly
changed
as
here
to
serve
a
barn
this
was
tames
barn
a
thatched
quadrangle
of
new
ricks
and
old
barns
and
sheds
built
of
boards
now
heavily
lichened
past
the
barn
it
went
as
before
flat
and
with
broad
ruts
and
a
slight
dip
on
the
right
side
a
wall
not
half
as
deep
as
the
corn
was
high
there
were
a
few
blackthorns
on
this
side
on
the
left
sheep
were
folded
in
clover
ahead
the
lockinge
woods
showed
their
tops
between
the
rounds
of
roundabout
hill
which
was
newly
reaped
and
goldbury
hill
which
was
part
stubble
part
aftermath
at
the
first
turning
to
west
hendred
which
made
the
road
crook
a
little
to
the
south
and
in
this
crook
there
were
two
or
three
rough
sarsens
but
blotched
with
orange
and
dull
silver
lying
deep
in
the
grass
a
little
way
back
i
had
noticed
another
on
the
left
and
there
was
another
i
think
east
of
arfield
farm
beside
the
track
past
the
second
turning
to
west
hendred
from
east
ginge
the
tiny
dip
or
wall
below
the
right
side
of
the
road
became
a
pleasant
high
green
wall
with
blackthorns
and
elders
on
it
and
the
road
was
a
green
one
flowery
with
scabious
and
had
a
bank
above
it
with
barley
at
the
edge
then
the
little
ginge
brook
and
its
hollow
of
elms
and
ash
trees
interrupted
the
road
but
a
few
yards
beyond
it
was
clear
again
where
the
hard
road
went
at
right
angles
away
from
it
to
red
barn
it
was
now
above
its
green
bank
and
this
was
eight
or
ten
feet
high
with
blackthorns
on
it
it
curved
slightly
round
the
southern
base
of
roundabout
hill
between
the
stubble
and
being
joined
by
a
track
from
the
south
it
was
worn
almost
grassless
after
crossing
a
track
to
ardington
it
was
slightly
raised
above
the
fields
on
both
sides
a
hard
road
joined
it
and
it
was
hardened
itself
and
had
a
line
of
young
beeches
and
elms
on
each
side
this
was
to
lead
up
to
one
of
the
gates
of
lockinge
park
which
it
entered
and
disappeared
it
must
have
been
bent
probably
southward
by
the
swelling
land
of
the
park
but
over
two
centuries
of
ploughing
have
left
nothing
of
it
visible
on
the
surface
i
turned
sharply
southward
at
the
edge
of
this
park
and
presently
back
to
the
past
a
house
of
great
size
with
some
conservatories
elms
lawns
and
water
garden
the
shadowy
and
bright
grass
occupied
at
that
hour
by
a
and
many
swallows
the
road
lined
on
both
sides
by
trees
and
overhung
by
valerian
and
had
an
unpleasant
sense
of
privacy
meant
for
others
the
turning
eastward
out
of
this
road
by
east
lockinge
post
office
was
in
line
with
ickleton
street
but
signs
of
an
exit
from
the
park
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
were
obliterated
by
cottages
and
gardens
this
turning
i
took
and
when
it
curved
decidedly
to
the
right
a
footpath
on
the
left
between
a
hedge
and
some
allotment
gardens
preserved
its
original
line
this
path
led
westward
into
a
road
coming
south
from
goddard
s
barn
on
the
side
of
the
entering
of
the
path
into
this
road
lay
the
good
house
of
west
lockinge
farm
its
barn
and
sheds
and
lodges
gathered
about
it
on
one
side
of
the
road
and
its
ricks
and
elm
trees
opposite
the
road
was
half
and
half
road
and
littered
with
straw
and
husks
where
the
fowls
were
stalking
and
pecking
with
a
laziness
that
seemed
perfectly
suited
to
a
sunday
early
morning
following
a
blazing
harvest
saturday
illustration
port
way
wantage
i
hoped
to
find
a
cart
track
going
west
from
the
other
side
of
this
road
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
thought
i
found
it
raised
a
little
in
the
stubble
it
had
been
sown
and
reaped
like
the
rest
of
the
field
but
it
was
a
little
weedier
and
grassier
it
was
making
over
the
swelling
arable
for
lark
hill
and
the
south
edge
of
wantage
but
i
could
not
find
it
in
the
clover
nor
in
the
barley
beyond
that
i
therefore
turned
north
into
round
hill
a
straight
piece
of
hard
road
going
west
into
wantage
with
no
hedges
but
grassy
borders
between
it
and
the
arable
on
either
side
this
may
be
the
icknield
way
or
its
successor
it
led
into
the
main
road
at
the
edge
of
wantage
and
this
i
followed
into
the
town
in
the
first
few
yards
i
noticed
the
sign
of
the
lord
nelson
on
the
left
i
recognized
it
as
the
work
of
that
venerable
artist
who
designs
the
faces
of
guys
and
all
over
the
country
i
could
tell
that
the
man
upon
the
signboard
was
nelson
because
the
uniform
corresponded
to
the
name
painted
below
the
face
was
as
much
like
nelson
as
king
george
iii
and
it
was
entirely
different
from
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
board
nevertheless
the
effort
was
to
be
preferred
to
a
more
accurate
portrait
painted
by
a
builder
and
decorator
s
man
from
a
picture
in
a
history
book
it
was
an
effort
to
represent
an
image
of
a
hero
the
builder
and
decorator
s
man
would
have
aimed
simply
at
reproducing
something
which
impressed
him
because
it
was
in
a
printed
book
his
horses
do
not
represent
what
he
knows
or
feels
about
horses
but
what
he
is
able
to
crib
from
a
photographer
in
a
book
advertising
somebody
s
food
or
embrocation
his
coach
and
horses
is
painful
to
see
because
it
ought
obviously
to
be
in
a
book
may
it
be
long
before
he
is
allowed
to
molest
the
shape
of
the
horse
or
dragon
carved
into
the
turf
of
white
horse
hill
in
its
present
shape
it
could
not
be
used
to
advertise
horse
food
or
embrocation
but
the
horse
above
alton
priors
could
be
so
used
and
doubtless
one
day
will
be
as
i
was
leaving
wantage
i
heard
a
blackbird
singing
in
a
garden
beyond
the
church
this
was
near
the
middle
of
august
and
a
full
month
since
i
had
last
heard
one
the
heat
had
dried
up
the
birds
songs
all
much
earlier
than
usual
and
now
the
rain
of
the
last
night
seemed
to
be
reviving
one
the
song
was
perfect
and
as
strange
a
thing
as
last
year
s
snow
crossing
the
letcombe
brook
i
was
out
again
between
hedges
and
in
the
company
of
telegraph
posts
on
the
road
to
ashbury
bishopstone
and
swindon
which
is
called
in
the
inch
ordnance
map
roman
it
seemed
the
only
continuation
of
ickleton
street
and
as
there
was
no
other
road
with
anything
like
the
same
course
in
the
valley
i
had
little
doubt
that
it
was
the
of
the
early
eighteenth
century
going
all
under
the
hills
between
them
and
childrey
sparsholt
and
uffington
so
under
white
horse
hill
leaving
woolston
and
compton
on
the
right
thence
to
ashbury
and
the
foot
of
the
downs
was
about
a
mile
on
the
left
and
between
them
and
the
road
the
cornland
dipped
considerably
looking
over
the
hedge
i
saw
first
a
broad
land
of
grass
and
then
a
line
of
telegraph
wires
making
for
letcombe
and
dividing
the
grass
from
a
broad
band
of
ripe
corn
beyond
that
was
a
band
of
very
green
roots
then
a
band
of
newly
ploughed
earth
then
stubble
dappled
with
dark
corn
stacks
and
above
them
the
hill
illustration
under
white
horse
hill
my
road
was
a
narrow
one
and
at
first
borderless
and
worn
to
some
depth
below
the
neighbouring
fields
at
the
top
of
its
ascent
out
of
wantage
it
had
a
bank
on
the
right
a
fence
on
the
left
instead
of
hedges
after
passing
ickleton
house
at
a
turning
i
reached
two
cottages
on
the
right
at
the
crossing
of
a
road
from
faringdon
to
letcombe
this
i
entered
on
the
south
side
to
look
for
a
road
between
mine
and
the
hills
a
parish
boundary
follows
this
road
and
also
the
lane
which
i
turned
into
on
the
right
almost
at
once
the
lane
was
green
and
ran
under
some
beeches
and
a
natural
turf
wall
it
was
deep
worn
and
rutted
as
it
descended
through
the
corn
and
barley
to
a
under
another
turf
wall
making
from
letcombe
regis
church
to
childrey
i
went
on
until
my
track
became
a
hard
road
to
lambourn
and
as
i
had
seen
no
sign
of
an
alternative
to
the
roman
way
i
turned
to
the
right
and
entered
it
again
at
the
crossing
for
childrey
and
letcombe
bassett
elms
clustered
at
the
crossing
and
the
road
was
deeply
worn
between
grassy
banks
it
continued
to
have
hardly
any
green
edge
and
as
it
was
usually
rising
or
falling
it
was
sunk
more
or
less
below
its
original
level
in
one
place
for
example
the
left
bank
was
nearly
twenty
feet
high
and
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
clouds
all
sopped
in
sunlight
the
land
was
almost
entirely
arable
on
either
side
with
standing
corn
or
stooks
or
stubble
in
one
place
past
the
turning
on
the
right
to
westcott
which
is
between
sparsholt
and
kingston
lisle
the
road
was
on
a
terrace
having
a
bank
on
the
left
and
falling
on
the
right
to
corn
and
a
thatched
farm
under
trees
there
were
elms
and
beeches
on
either
side
but
no
hedge
the
trees
of
lisle
park
gave
lines
of
handsome
beeches
to
either
side
of
the
road
trees
of
less
than
a
hundred
years
all
and
in
fact
almost
uniform
and
planted
at
reasonable
intervals
the
ridge
of
the
downs
was
not
a
mile
distant
and
from
it
the
grass
of
a
yellowish
green
colour
undulated
without
a
break
to
the
road
sprinkled
with
beeches
and
barred
with
fir
plantations
past
the
blowingstone
hill
and
the
turning
to
kingston
lisle
these
undulations
are
bare
and
carved
by
a
natural
cutting
at
this
point
the
top
of
the
downs
was
only
half
a
mile
away
and
thenceforward
it
was
never
more
than
a
mile
until
beyond
bishopstone
actually
the
nearest
point
to
the
ridge
was
perhaps
where
the
road
twisted
sharp
to
the
left
to
the
bottom
of
a
coombe
and
then
sharp
back
again
to
get
out
of
it
as
the
floor
of
the
coombe
sloped
upwards
into
the
hill
these
twists
gave
a
road
which
was
bound
to
cross
it
at
the
lowest
possible
gradient
the
coombe
had
steep
smooth
sides
of
yellowish
grass
and
a
winding
flat
floor
and
through
the
big
scattered
thorns
and
elders
of
it
a
track
went
down
to
fawler
the
road
wound
again
to
round
a
high
bank
on
the
left
and
again
to
circumvent
a
thorny
hollow
on
the
right
and
soon
the
white
horse
was
coming
into
view
there
were
woods
steep
above
on
the
left
there
had
been
hedges
on
both
sides
since
blowingstone
hill
often
bushy
and
thick
and
overscrambled
by
climbers
as
for
example
near
britchcombe
farm
here
the
road
had
a
green
sunken
course
divided
from
the
hard
one
by
a
thicket
this
and
its
thatched
dependencies
their
trees
their
elders
and
nettles
stood
close
to
the
road
but
a
little
back
from
it
and
a
little
above
it
under
the
almost
precipitous
ash
wood
of
the
hill
and
away
from
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
sloped
another
coombe
of
thorns
and
also
of
willows
and
some
water
illustration
dragon
hill
a
little
past
britchcombe
farm
the
dragon
hill
came
in
sight
above
a
slope
of
oats
and
yellowed
grass
then
the
road
twisted
again
left
and
right
to
cross
another
coombe
grown
with
larch
trees
on
its
lower
half
and
having
a
pool
in
it
near
woolstone
lodge
but
the
upper
half
bending
back
under
the
dragon
hill
with
a
few
thorns
on
its
steep
and
furrowed
walls
rising
up
out
of
the
coombe
as
usual
the
road
was
between
steep
banks
and
on
them
thorn
bushes
scabious
and
meadow
crane
flowers
at
the
crossing
to
shrivenham
and
lambourn
i
caught
sight
of
the
crest
and
haggard
beech
clump
of
barbury
above
the
nearer
hills
this
crossing
was
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
compton
beauchamp
the
last
of
more
than
half
a
dozen
villages
which
the
road
passed
by
on
its
right
hand
without
touching
ashbury
was
the
first
village
traversed
by
the
road
since
upton
as
i
approached
ashbury
through
corn
that
now
ran
right
to
the
top
of
the
downs
i
had
a
bank
above
me
on
the
left
and
one
below
me
on
the
right
and
i
could
see
now
both
liddington
and
barbury
clumps
and
to
the
left
of
liddington
one
high
bare
breast
of
turf
a
lesser
road
turned
down
to
odstone
farm
which
i
was
very
glad
to
see
again
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
my
right
its
five
plain
windows
in
a
row
two
in
the
roof
and
those
below
not
to
be
counted
because
of
the
garden
shrubs
it
was
a
grey
stone
house
with
a
steep
grey
roof
and
a
chimney
stack
at
either
side
there
were
elms
behind
it
and
tiled
and
thatched
sheds
all
on
its
right
hand
and
the
road
going
straight
down
to
its
left
side
illustration
green
terrace
near
ashbury
the
hedge
gave
way
to
show
me
the
elms
and
thatched
barns
and
ricks
of
ashbury
its
church
tower
among
trees
rather
apart
and
nearer
the
downs
the
road
descended
under
a
steep
bank
with
a
green
course
parallel
it
turned
right
and
then
left
round
some
elm
trees
and
past
a
hollow
on
the
right
containing
a
broad
millpond
enclosed
in
a
parallelogram
of
elms
at
ashbury
the
road
turned
to
the
right
away
from
the
church
to
the
rose
and
crown
and
the
two
elm
trees
standing
in
and
then
back
again
to
the
left
into
its
original
line
but
parallel
with
the
road
a
footpath
ran
from
the
church
on
a
terrace
just
wide
enough
for
a
waggon
it
had
a
green
wall
above
and
below
grass
on
the
left
lucerne
on
the
right
it
rose
and
fell
more
than
the
road
as
it
made
for
idstone
between
the
barley
the
terrace
seemed
to
be
continued
across
the
deeply
worn
road
from
swinley
down
but
the
path
turned
to
the
right
and
into
the
main
road
this
terrace
road
seemed
to
be
a
very
possible
course
for
an
old
though
perhaps
only
an
alternative
road
i
stopped
for
a
little
time
at
ashbury
and
asking
for
tea
at
a
cottage
and
shop
combined
i
was
asked
into
a
silent
but
formidable
sunday
assembly
of
three
incompatible
and
hostile
but
respectful
generations
a
severe
but
cheerful
grandmother
in
black
and
spectacles
with
one
finger
still
marking
a
place
in
the
bible
a
preoccupied
morose
mother
also
in
black
a
depressed
but
giddy
daughter
fresh
from
the
counter
of
a
london
shop
and
already
wondering
what
she
was
going
to
do
at
ashbury
this
girl
poured
out
my
tea
and
told
me
that
there
were
some
very
good
apples
on
the
tree
next
door
neither
she
nor
her
relatives
because
it
was
sunday
could
buy
these
or
in
any
way
procure
them
so
she
told
me
though
she
had
begun
to
want
them
very
much
after
half
a
day
at
her
native
village
if
i
went
and
there
seemed
no
objection
to
the
damnation
of
a
casual
wayfarer
i
could
probably
get
some
the
old
lady
who
lived
in
the
cottage
next
door
said
as
if
she
were
stating
a
fact
in
the
natural
history
of
ashbury
that
she
had
no
apples
that
they
were
very
troublesome
to
knock
down
that
none
had
fallen
from
the
trees
during
the
day
and
that
she
was
perfectly
certain
there
would
be
none
until
the
morrow
on
the
morrow
i
hoped
to
be
many
miles
from
ashbury
and
so
i
wished
her
a
good
afternoon
in
spite
of
the
rigid
sabbatarianism
of
her
trees
i
returned
to
the
cottage
where
i
had
been
drinking
tea
and
told
the
girl
that
no
apples
would
fall
until
monday
morning
and
asked
her
if
she
knew
any
other
kind
of
apple
trees
in
ashbury
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
she
did
not
for
i
found
that
sunday
s
tea
cost
twice
as
much
as
saturday
s
or
monday
s
it
being
apparently
the
right
of
the
righteous
to
prey
upon
the
damned
even
if
in
so
doing
they
put
themselves
into
a
position
apparently
as
graceless
as
that
of
the
damned
i
thought
of
asking
a
clergyman
if
this
was
so
and
seeing
a
man
whom
i
took
to
be
a
clergyman
because
his
collar
was
fastened
behind
instead
of
in
front
i
walked
after
him
but
he
suddenly
stopped
and
went
into
the
very
cottage
of
the
old
lady
whose
apples
would
not
fall
before
monday
morning
and
this
looked
so
like
a
conspiracy
that
i
hastened
away
glad
to
have
made
these
discoveries
in
the
natural
history
of
ashbury
illustration
coombe
at
bishopstone
the
deeply
worn
road
from
swinley
down
cut
across
my
road
south
of
the
green
terrace
road
at
idstone
and
sent
it
northwards
twenty
yards
or
so
just
as
akeman
street
cutting
across
the
upper
and
lower
icknield
ways
near
tring
sent
each
nearly
a
mile
northwards
after
this
i
could
see
no
trace
of
the
little
terrace
road
though
it
was
possibly
marked
by
a
bank
dividing
the
next
fields
to
the
road
from
those
beyond
and
then
by
a
mere
division
between
crops
to
a
point
above
or
beyond
bishopstone
between
idstone
and
bishopstone
the
road
entered
wiltshire
without
ceremony
at
the
turning
just
before
reaching
bishopstone
the
road
was
worn
very
deep
and
above
it
a
bare
coombe
ran
up
into
the
downs
with
a
track
along
its
edge
more
often
than
not
after
leaving
wantage
the
road
had
been
worn
thus
deep
because
it
traversed
a
country
of
numerous
and
abrupt
undulations
these
made
fairly
steep
ascents
and
descents
necessary
and
they
invariably
mean
the
hollowing
out
of
any
unmetalled
of
any
ancient
and
not
roman
road
the
plough
could
never
do
any
harm
to
this
road
but
the
port
way
between
wantage
and
streatley
it
could
hide
from
most
eyes
in
a
few
seasons
the
ickleton
street
between
upton
and
lockinge
park
would
almost
disappear
under
a
single
ploughing
and
doubtless
often
has
done
so
to
reappear
in
the
same
or
a
parallel
course
when
needed
at
bishopstone
the
road
twisted
right
and
left
almost
as
at
ashbury
this
was
into
a
coombe
with
a
little
stream
in
it
and
there
were
some
signs
that
the
old
way
had
rather
been
left
and
right
that
is
sloping
down
to
the
ascending
bottom
of
the
coombe
and
up
again
as
in
other
coombes
but
the
coombe
and
the
bare
downs
about
it
were
so
shaped
by
nature
by
wearing
and
apparently
by
deliberate
but
inexplicable
cutting
that
a
mere
road
could
not
be
traced
with
certainty
the
coombe
branched
as
it
rose
up
into
the
downs
and
formed
several
enormous
convexities
and
concavities
of
turf
several
of
their
converging
slopes
were
cut
evenly
into
three
or
four
or
nearly
a
dozen
green
terraces
like
staircases
all
of
which
had
a
company
of
giants
sat
there
would
have
given
a
view
of
the
below
sheep
were
strewn
over
some
of
these
terraces
making
arrangements
of
white
dots
of
a
fascinating
irregularity
unless
it
has
become
a
trick
only
a
great
artist
could
make
similar
arrangements
of
equal
beauty
the
unknown
laws
which
produce
these
inevitable
accidents
are
great
managers
of
the
beautiful
the
succession
of
bays
in
an
island
coast
and
the
general
form
of
the
island
itself
of
course
particularly
of
islands
off
our
own
coast
are
beautiful
in
their
way
the
shape
of
england
and
wales
the
shape
of
ireland
of
man
and
of
the
whole
flock
of
the
hebrides
please
me
with
their
unity
fascinate
me
with
their
complexity
a
mistaken
map
of
any
such
known
place
is
as
bad
√¶sthetically
as
geographically
children
are
fond
of
inventing
islands
with
marvellous
inlets
more
romantic
than
anything
on
the
west
coast
of
scotland
or
scandinavia
but
i
have
never
seen
one
of
these
invented
islands
that
i
could
like
apart
from
its
creator
or
its
names
or
its
sites
marked
buried
gold
and
so
on
they
are
incredible
and
raise
no
wonder
they
are
not
masters
work
i
do
not
know
if
geologists
can
support
me
but
leonardo
s
cave
in
the
virgin
of
the
rocks
always
makes
me
uneasy
by
what
seems
to
me
to
be
its
artificial
impossibility
another
great
picture
which
is
i
think
faulty
in
a
similar
way
reminds
me
of
another
beauty
the
beauty
of
the
scattering
and
gathering
of
the
stars
i
never
look
at
titian
s
bacchus
and
ariadne
without
feeling
the
constellation
in
that
glorious
purple
is
an
unhappy
invention
it
may
be
my
poor
astronomy
but
i
should
be
inclined
to
say
that
stars
never
could
be
spread
exactly
as
they
are
in
that
picture
it
is
not
merely
that
there
is
i
believe
no
such
constellation
but
that
the
form
is
one
which
for
some
reason
they
would
avoid
though
by
picking
a
star
here
and
a
star
there
it
might
be
patched
up
birds
always
fly
and
always
sail
in
these
just
patterns
some
are
so
just
that
like
that
of
the
sheep
above
bishopstone
i
should
like
to
have
them
copied
on
paper
to
look
at
for
their
mystical
arithmetic
the
village
the
mill
and
the
church
were
lower
down
to
the
right
below
the
spring
on
the
modern
road
and
its
northward
branches
only
a
cottage
with
a
thatched
roof
on
a
level
with
my
feet
lay
near
the
green
coombe
track
above
the
water
the
road
went
on
again
between
corn
and
roots
westwards
now
and
gradually
farther
from
the
downs
until
a
from
bourton
cut
across
it
and
sent
it
southwards
a
by
a
willowy
spring
before
it
turned
west
again
this
road
southward
into
the
marlborough
and
hungerford
road
may
yet
be
shown
to
be
part
of
the
icknield
way
for
at
totterdown
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
it
curves
round
and
makes
a
line
with
the
road
to
chisledon
under
liddington
hill
the
road
much
resembling
the
icknield
way
which
is
called
ridgeway
on
the
maps
it
rose
now
a
hedged
and
elmy
road
to
five
hundred
feet
and
had
a
deep
grassy
hollow
and
elm
trees
below
between
it
and
the
cornland
of
the
downs
it
dipped
to
a
spring
and
a
post
office
at
hinton
parva
it
dipped
again
and
rose
to
a
view
over
the
northern
vale
to
the
dim
watery
wall
of
the
cotswolds
at
this
height
it
crossed
ermine
street
just
after
passing
a
black
all
four
ways
at
the
crossing
were
deeply
worn
and
made
a
pit
with
bushy
banks
and
tiny
green
triangles
of
waste
in
the
midst
in
a
past
the
crossing
of
ermine
street
i
was
at
wanborough
there
the
road
forked
at
the
calley
there
is
not
a
scrap
of
real
or
pretended
documentary
evidence
for
either
road
at
least
until
the
mentioned
in
the
saxon
charter
relating
to
wanborough
have
been
identified
the
road
had
the
advantage
of
keeping
near
the
hills
instead
of
going
clean
away
west
like
the
one
this
road
may
at
last
be
connected
with
one
of
those
rumoured
roads
going
westwards
under
the
secondary
line
of
chalk
hills
past
holy
cross
at
swindon
past
elcombe
and
studley
to
anne
at
brislington
in
somerset
or
to
devonshire
and
this
continuation
may
at
last
be
shown
to
be
entitled
to
the
name
of
icknield
way
i
followed
the
road
because
it
seemed
possible
to
connect
it
with
one
very
much
like
the
icknield
way
and
in
a
similar
relation
to
the
downs
going
through
wroughton
and
broad
hinton
and
from
there
either
to
avebury
or
to
yatesbury
and
so
by
juggler
s
lane
to
cherhill
on
its
way
to
bath
liddington
clump
the
straight
ridge
and
the
castle
rampart
upon
it
were
clear
ahead
as
i
took
this
turning
wanborough
s
towered
and
spired
church
stood
at
the
top
of
a
slope
of
grass
on
my
right
it
was
a
crooked
hedged
road
with
a
grassy
edge
and
a
path
on
the
grass
and
the
telegraph
posts
followed
it
it
passed
out
of
wanborough
parish
at
a
tiny
stream
that
crossed
the
road
in
a
deep
narrow
cleft
with
willows
and
willow
herbs
below
on
the
right
and
in
the
widening
cleft
a
derelict
mill
a
steep
garden
plot
and
a
row
of
beehives
it
rose
up
narrow
deep
and
steep
to
the
bell
at
liddington
there
i
turned
to
the
left
into
the
swindon
road
and
almost
at
once
to
the
left
again
leaving
the
church
on
my
left
this
took
me
past
two
or
three
houses
of
medbourne
and
sharp
to
the
left
and
right
through
the
hamlet
of
badbury
where
a
great
elm
stands
at
the
first
turning
above
a
deep
hollow
and
a
road
going
northward
down
it
to
the
right
then
crossing
the
roman
road
from
mildenhall
to
wanborough
nythe
i
was
at
chisledon
and
another
cleft
in
the
land
this
cleft
is
often
precipitous
and
so
narrow
that
you
could
almost
play
cards
across
it
a
streamlet
and
a
single
line
of
railway
wind
along
the
bottom
the
church
stands
at
the
edge
where
it
is
gentler
and
the
village
is
scattered
over
the
slopes
and
edges
i
was
hungry
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
first
inn
at
five
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
a
small
quiet
crowd
of
drinkers
in
black
coats
and
hats
waited
to
be
let
in
at
six
no
one
answered
my
knock
i
knocked
louder
and
still
louder
on
the
woodwork
of
the
door
then
i
rapped
the
glass
and
rapped
louder
and
many
times
but
no
one
came
and
as
i
was
too
hungry
to
want
justice
i
went
to
the
next
inn
here
the
door
was
instantly
opened
by
a
little
landlady
with
fuzzy
hair
and
a
gnomish
face
she
was
swift
and
clean
and
so
light
and
quick
was
her
step
that
every
time
i
heard
her
approaching
i
expected
a
child
she
was
sorry
to
say
that
she
had
no
bed
to
spare
but
told
me
of
someone
that
might
i
tried
in
vain
then
called
opposite
where
refreshments
were
advertised
an
enormous
woman
stood
wedged
in
the
doorway
she
was
sullen
and
faintly
moustached
and
she
had
her
hands
hanging
down
because
there
was
no
room
on
either
side
of
her
to
clasp
them
and
no
room
in
the
doorway
for
her
to
rest
them
upon
the
fat
superincumbent
upon
her
hips
i
said
good
evening
and
she
remained
silent
i
asked
her
if
she
had
a
bed
to
spare
she
looked
me
up
and
down
with
a
movement
of
head
and
eyes
and
asked
me
gradually
where
i
came
from
i
was
so
taken
aback
that
i
told
her
like
a
child
from
east
hendred
which
was
absurd
she
retreated
to
ask
her
husband
he
appeared
alone
and
hanging
down
his
head
shook
it
and
said
that
he
did
not
think
he
could
spare
me
a
bed
having
no
gift
of
speech
i
turned
very
rapidly
away
from
him
and
back
to
the
inn
the
landlady
thought
of
someone
else
made
inquiries
and
assured
me
that
the
bed
would
be
ready
when
somebody
got
back
from
church
so
i
went
out
and
looked
at
burderop
ladder
hill
and
the
turning
to
the
downs
and
the
woman
was
back
from
church
and
opened
the
door
to
me
she
had
a
background
of
women
taking
off
sunday
hats
and
putting
away
veils
and
and
said
she
was
sorry
but
a
niece
had
come
and
there
was
no
room
for
me
in
the
darkening
street
i
saw
an
old
man
at
a
gate
with
a
genial
face
and
the
mouth
of
one
accustomed
to
horses
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
of
a
bed
to
spare
no
no
he
chuckled
with
increased
geniality
you
ve
come
to
the
wrong
place
no
he
continued
i
can
t
tell
you
why
but
if
you
want
a
bed
you
have
to
go
to
a
he
was
only
a
visitor
to
chisledon
and
i
wished
him
better
treatment
than
i
had
got
i
set
out
for
swindon
in
about
a
mile
i
came
to
another
inn
where
i
had
always
enjoyed
the
bread
and
cheese
and
ale
and
i
unwillingly
silenced
a
company
of
grave
drinkers
standing
at
the
bar
they
suspended
their
glasses
while
the
landlord
said
that
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
get
a
bed
that
side
of
swindon
i
tried
at
coate
the
barmaid
appealed
to
macfaggart
who
was
standing
by
perhaps
macfaggart
can
spare
a
bed
this
series
of
refusals
was
i
am
convinced
pure
but
the
stout
woman
refused
me
almost
beyond
doubt
because
i
was
a
stranger
whom
she
could
not
immediately
classify
i
could
not
be
classed
as
a
gentleman
as
a
young
gent
or
swell
or
as
a
plain
young
she
decided
not
to
risk
it
perhaps
she
had
savings
about
the
house
or
did
she
think
that
underneath
less
than
two
days
beard
that
oldish
and
not
very
clean
burberry
waterproof
those
good
but
very
baggy
trousers
murder
was
lurking
no
probably
she
felt
not
the
very
slightest
inclination
to
please
me
and
as
it
only
meant
half
a
crown
her
one
difficulty
in
refusing
was
her
natural
sullenness
increased
by
the
presence
of
the
nondescript
and
unsympathetic
casual
stranger
on
a
sunday
country
people
know
a
country
gentleman
a
sporting
financier
a
tradesman
a
young
townsman
clerk
or
artisan
a
working
man
and
a
real
tramp
or
roadster
some
of
them
know
the
artist
or
distinguished
foreigner
with
a
foot
of
hair
hat
and
corduroy
or
soft
tweeds
a
cloak
and
an
ostentatious
pipe
tasselled
or
of
enormous
bulk
or
elaborate
form
or
unusual
substance
some
know
the
hairy
and
hygienic
man
in
sandals
to
be
elbowed
out
at
nightfall
after
a
day
s
walking
by
an
unconscious
conspiracy
of
a
whole
village
was
enough
to
produce
either
a
hate
of
chisledon
or
a
belief
that
the
devil
or
a
distinguished
relative
was
organizing
the
opposition
but
during
those
four
unexpected
miles
to
swindon
in
the
volcanic
heat
of
evening
which
produced
several
pains
and
a
constant
struggle
between
impatient
mind
and
dull
tired
body
i
felt
chiefly
i
suffer
i
do
not
want
to
suffer
and
only
now
and
then
the
face
of
stout
or
of
smallbeer
or
of
the
genial
old
man
with
the
horsy
mouth
came
into
my
head
and
turned
my
depression
to
fury
possibly
they
were
afraid
of
german
spies
at
chisledon
not
far
from
maidstone
in
the
summer
of
some
poor
cottage
children
were
telling
me
how
a
german
spy
wanted
to
rob
them
of
the
lunch
they
were
taking
to
school
he
was
a
dark
stranger
with
a
beard
and
he
was
waiting
about
at
a
crossing
partly
overhung
by
trees
and
they
were
convinced
that
he
wished
to
steal
their
food
and
that
his
reason
for
doing
so
was
his
position
as
german
spy
at
swindon
i
felt
what
a
man
feels
in
a
place
where
he
knows
one
man
instead
of
knowing
scores
of
children
and
feeling
that
every
passing
stranger
was
of
the
same
family
ready
at
a
touch
to
be
changed
to
a
friend
but
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
bed
surrounded
by
the
following
decorations
pictures
of
ships
in
quiet
and
in
roaring
seas
of
roses
twining
about
the
words
the
lord
shall
be
thy
everlasting
light
of
a
going
through
a
ford
with
three
children
on
his
back
of
an
italian
boatman
and
three
buxom
girls
one
clinking
glasses
with
him
advertisements
of
an
aperient
and
of
cheap
cigarettes
the
advertisement
of
cigarettes
dwarfed
all
the
rest
for
not
only
was
the
lettering
large
but
there
was
also
a
coloured
picture
of
a
swarthy
and
hearty
woman
practically
naked
to
the
waist
she
was
smiling
with
her
dark
eyes
and
her
lips
were
parted
i
could
not
imagine
what
she
had
to
do
with
cigarettes
of
any
kind
was
there
a
kind
of
suggestion
that
these
bold
bad
foreign
beauties
undoubtedly
beauties
were
capable
of
smoking
the
cigarettes
or
was
the
picture
meant
to
be
a
stimulus
to
some
a
satisfaction
to
others
of
those
who
sat
at
their
ease
drinking
and
smoking
and
thinking
of
women
in
the
taproom
of
the
most
rustic
public
houses
two
or
three
of
these
women
sometimes
adorn
the
walls
along
with
a
picture
of
a
diseased
cow
and
of
its
mouth
stomach
and
udder
some
are
dark
some
are
fair
and
i
think
certainly
meant
to
be
english
but
all
are
incompletely
draped
and
unashamed
the
dark
ones
are
vaunting
heathen
beauties
the
fair
tend
to
be
insipid
with
expressions
borrowed
from
the
pious
virgins
of
religious
pictures
sometimes
the
bacchante
and
the
pious
virgin
are
to
be
seen
side
by
side
the
sacred
one
being
supplied
by
the
village
grocer
at
christmas
they
are
equally
beautiful
have
regular
features
perfect
complexions
and
expressionless
mouths
and
are
doing
nothing
in
particular
except
posing
so
that
the
artist
shall
observe
their
bosoms
or
in
the
case
of
sacred
pictures
their
throats
and
the
whites
of
their
eyes
i
do
not
think
it
could
be
shown
that
these
pictures
spoil
the
chances
of
girls
with
unclassical
features
and
in
the
villages
in
these
matters
the
moth
that
desires
the
star
is
likely
to
end
in
a
candle
flame
whether
or
not
he
mistook
it
for
a
star
in
these
new
towns
i
see
women
looking
as
if
they
were
made
in
the
chemists
shops
which
are
so
numerous
and
conspicuous
in
the
streets
thin
pallid
dyspeptic
vampirine
beauties
having
nothing
but
sex
in
common
with
the
bold
swarthy
alien
on
the
cigarette
advertisement
at
swindon
the
explorer
of
the
icknield
way
has
all
the
world
before
him
he
may
go
through
marlborough
into
the
pewsey
valley
and
either
along
under
the
hills
through
lavington
to
westbury
or
turning
out
of
the
pewsey
valley
to
old
sarum
and
beyond
westbury
or
sarum
into
the
extreme
west
and
he
will
be
on
a
road
of
the
same
type
as
the
icknield
way
for
the
greater
part
of
the
distance
or
he
may
content
himself
with
reaching
avebury
or
he
may
miss
avebury
and
aim
at
bath
at
present
documents
and
traditions
keep
a
perfect
silence
west
of
wanborough
and
among
mere
possibilities
the
choice
is
endless
the
easiest
the
pleasantest
and
the
wrongest
thing
to
do
is
to
take
to
the
ridgeway
at
wanborough
and
follow
it
along
the
supposed
course
under
liddington
hill
under
barbury
castle
and
then
up
on
to
the
ridge
to
avebury
but
though
it
is
possible
that
in
the
middle
ages
this
was
done
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
green
way
going
high
up
on
the
ridge
past
glory
ann
barn
is
not
coeval
with
is
not
the
same
road
as
the
road
that
has
crept
persistently
but
humbly
under
the
chilterns
and
berkshire
downs
such
a
road
ran
more
risks
than
the
ridgeway
from
the
plough
its
preservation
between
upton
and
lockinge
park
is
miraculous
it
might
easily
have
disappeared
in
the
ploughland
about
chisledon
or
the
rich
pastures
of
coate
let
the
conjecturer
thus
skip
a
few
miles
in
his
westerly
or
course
and
he
can
go
rapidly
ahead
following
under
the
main
ridge
to
avebury
or
under
the
secondary
ridge
three
or
four
miles
north
of
it
towards
calne
and
bath
it
is
a
game
of
skill
which
deserves
a
select
reputation
to
find
an
ancient
road
of
the
same
character
as
the
oxfordshire
and
berkshire
icknield
way
going
west
or
beyond
wanborough
the
utmost
reward
of
this
conjecturing
traveller
would
be
to
find
himself
on
the
banks
of
the
towy
or
beside
the
tomb

giraldus
