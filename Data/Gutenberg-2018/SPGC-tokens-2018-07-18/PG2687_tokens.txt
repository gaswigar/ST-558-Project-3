postscriptum
the
snare
chapter
i
the
affair
at
tavora
it
is
established
beyond
doubt
that
butler
was
drunk
at
the
time
this
rests
upon
the
evidence
of
sergeant
flanagan
and
the
troopers
who
accompanied
him
and
it
rests
upon
butler
s
own
word
as
we
shall
see
and
let
me
add
here
and
now
that
however
wild
and
irresponsible
a
rascal
he
may
have
been
yet
by
his
own
lights
he
was
a
man
of
honour
incapable
of
falsehood
even
though
it
were
calculated
to
save
his
skin
i
do
not
deny
that
sir
thomas
picton
has
described
him
as
a
thieving
but
i
am
sure
that
this
was
merely
the
downright
rather
extravagant
manner
of
censure
peculiar
to
that
distinguished
general
and
that
those
who
have
taken
the
expression
at
its
purely
literal
value
have
been
lacking
at
once
in
charity
and
in
knowledge
of
the
caustic
uncompromising
terms
of
speech
of
general
picton
whom
lord
wellington
you
will
remember
called
a
rough
foulmouthed
devil
in
further
extenuation
it
may
truthfully
be
urged
that
the
whole
hideous
and
odious
affair
was
the
result
of
a
misapprehension
although
i
can
not
go
so
far
as
one
of
lieutenant
butler
s
apologists
and
accept
the
view
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
deliberate
plot
on
the
part
of
his
host
at
regoa
that
is
a
misconception
easily
explained
this
host
s
name
happened
to
be
souza
and
the
apologist
in
question
has
very
rashly
leapt
at
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
member
of
that
notoriously
intriguing
family
of
which
the
chief
members
were
the
principal
souza
of
the
council
of
regency
at
lisbon
and
the
chevalier
souza
portuguese
minister
to
the
court
of
james
s
unacquainted
with
portugal
our
apologist
was
evidently
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
the
name
of
souza
is
almost
as
common
in
that
country
as
the
name
of
smith
in
this
he
may
also
have
been
misled
by
the
fact
that
principal
souza
did
not
neglect
to
make
the
utmost
capital
out
of
the
affair
thereby
increasing
the
difficulties
with
which
lord
wellington
was
already
contending
as
a
result
of
incompetence
and
deliberate
malice
on
the
part
both
of
the
ministry
at
home
and
of
the
administration
in
lisbon
indeed
but
for
these
factors
it
is
unlikely
that
the
affair
could
ever
have
taken
place
at
all
if
there
had
been
more
energy
on
the
part
of
perceval
and
the
members
of
the
cabinet
if
there
had
been
less
bad
faith
and
on
the
part
of
the
opposition
lord
wellington
s
campaign
would
not
have
been
starved
as
it
was
and
if
there
had
been
less
bad
faith
and
of
an
even
more
stupid
and
flagrant
kind
on
the
part
of
the
portuguese
council
of
regency
the
british
expeditionary
force
would
not
have
been
left
without
the
stipulated
supplies
and
otherwise
hindered
at
every
step
lord
wellington
might
have
experienced
the
mental
agony
of
sir
john
moore
under
similar
circumstances
fifteen
months
earlier
that
he
did
suffer
and
was
to
suffer
yet
more
his
correspondence
shows
but
his
iron
will
prevented
that
suffering
from
disturbing
the
equanimity
of
his
mind
the
council
of
regency
in
its
concern
to
court
popularity
with
the
aristocracy
of
portugal
might
balk
his
measures
by
its
deliberate
supineness
echoes
might
reach
him
of
the
voices
at
stephen
s
that
loudly
dubbed
his
dispositions
rash
presumptuous
and
silly
journalists
at
home
and
men
of
the
stamp
of
lord
grey
might
exploit
their
abysmal
military
ignorance
in
reckless
criticism
and
censure
of
his
operations
he
knew
what
a
passionate
storm
of
anger
and
denunciation
had
arisen
from
the
opposition
when
he
had
been
raised
to
the
peerage
some
months
earlier
after
the
glorious
victory
of
talavera
and
how
that
victory
notwithstanding
it
had
been
proclaimed
that
his
conduct
of
the
campaign
was
so
incompetent
as
to
deserve
not
reward
but
punishment
and
he
was
aware
of
the
growing
unpopularity
of
the
war
in
england
knew
that
the
government
ignorant
of
what
he
was
so
laboriously
preparing
was
chafing
at
his
inactivity
of
the
past
few
months
so
that
a
member
of
the
cabinet
wrote
to
him
exasperatedly
incredibly
and
fatuously
for
god
s
sake
do
something
anything
so
that
blood
be
a
heart
less
stout
might
have
been
broken
a
genius
less
mighty
stifled
in
this
evil
tangle
of
stupidity
incompetence
and
malignity
that
sprang
up
and
flourished
about
him
on
every
hand
a
man
less
must
have
succumbed
to
exasperation
thrown
up
his
command
and
taken
ship
for
home
inviting
some
of
his
innumerable
critics
to
take
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
troops
and
give
free
rein
to
the
military
genius
that
inspired
their
critical
dissertations
wellington
however
has
been
rightly
termed
of
iron
and
never
did
he
show
himself
more
of
iron
than
in
those
trying
days
of
stern
but
with
a
passionless
sternness
he
pursued
his
way
towards
the
goal
he
had
set
himself
allowing
no
criticism
no
censure
no
invective
so
much
as
to
give
him
pause
in
his
majestic
progress
unfortunately
the
lofty
calm
of
the
was
not
shared
by
his
lieutenants
the
light
division
was
quartered
along
the
river
agueda
watching
the
spanish
frontier
beyond
which
marshal
ney
was
demonstrating
against
ciudad
rodrigo
and
for
lack
of
funds
its
commander
sir
robert
craufurd
found
himself
at
last
unable
to
feed
his
troops
exasperated
by
these
circumstances
sir
robert
was
betrayed
into
an
act
of
rashness
he
seized
some
church
plate
at
pinhel
that
he
might
convert
it
into
rations
it
was
an
act
which
considering
the
general
state
of
public
feeling
in
the
country
at
the
time
might
have
had
the
gravest
consequences
and
sir
robert
was
subsequently
forced
to
do
penance
and
afford
redress
that
however
is
another
story
i
but
mention
the
incident
here
because
the
affair
of
tavora
with
which
i
am
concerned
may
be
taken
to
have
arisen
directly
out
of
it
and
sir
robert
s
behaviour
may
be
construed
as
setting
an
example
and
thus
as
affording
yet
another
extenuation
of
lieutenant
butler
s
offence
our
lieutenant
was
sent
upon
a
foraging
expedition
into
the
valley
of
the
upper
douro
at
the
head
of
a
of
the
dragoons
two
squadrons
of
which
were
attached
at
the
time
to
the
light
division
to
be
more
precise
he
was
to
purchase
and
bring
into
pinhel
a
hundred
head
of
cattle
intended
some
for
slaughter
and
some
for
draught
his
instructions
were
to
proceed
as
far
as
regoa
and
there
report
himself
to
one
bartholomew
bearsley
a
prosperous
and
influential
english
whose
father
had
acquired
considerable
vineyards
in
the
douro
he
was
reminded
of
the
almost
hostile
disposition
of
the
peasantry
in
certain
districts
warned
to
handle
them
with
tact
and
to
suffer
no
straggling
on
the
part
of
his
troopers
and
advised
to
place
himself
in
the
hands
of
bearsley
for
all
that
related
to
the
purchase
of
the
cattle
let
it
be
admitted
at
once
that
had
sir
robert
craufurd
been
acquainted
with
butler
s
irresponsible
nature
he
would
have
selected
any
officer
rather
than
our
lieutenant
to
command
that
expedition
but
the
irish
dragoons
had
only
lately
come
to
pinhel
and
the
general
himself
was
not
immediately
concerned
lieutenant
butler
set
out
on
a
blustering
day
of
march
at
the
head
of
his
troopers
accompanied
by
cornet
o
rourke
and
two
sergeants
and
at
pesqueira
he
was
further
reinforced
by
a
portuguese
guide
they
found
quarters
that
night
at
ervedoza
and
early
on
the
morrow
they
were
in
the
saddle
again
riding
along
the
heights
above
the
cachao
da
valleria
through
which
the
yellow
swollen
river
swirled
and
foamed
along
its
rocky
way
the
prospect
formidable
even
in
the
full
bloom
of
fruitful
and
luxuriant
summer
was
forbidding
and
menacing
now
as
some
imagined
gorge
of
the
nether
regions
the
towering
granite
heights
across
the
turgid
stream
were
shrouded
in
mist
and
sweeping
rain
and
from
the
leaden
heavens
overhead
the
downpour
was
of
a
sullen
and
merciless
steadiness
starting
at
every
step
a
miniature
torrent
to
go
swell
the
roaring
waters
in
the
gorge
and
drenching
the
troop
alike
in
body
and
in
spirit
ahead
swathed
to
the
chin
in
his
blue
cavalry
cloak
the
water
streaming
from
his
leather
helmet
rode
lieutenant
butler
cursing
the
weather
the
country
the
light
division
and
everything
else
that
occurred
to
him
as
contributing
to
his
present
discomfort
beside
him
astride
of
a
mule
rode
the
portuguese
guide
in
a
caped
cloak
of
thatched
straw
which
made
him
look
for
all
the
world
like
a
bottle
of
his
native
wine
in
its
straw
sheath
conversation
between
the
two
was
out
of
the
question
for
the
guide
spoke
no
english
and
the
lieutenant
s
knowledge
of
portuguese
was
very
far
from
conversational
presently
the
ground
sloped
and
the
troop
descended
from
the
heights
by
a
road
flanked
with
dripping
pinewoods
black
and
melancholy
that
for
a
while
screened
them
off
from
the
remainder
of
the
sodden
world
thence
they
emerged
near
the
head
of
the
bridge
that
spanned
the
swollen
river
and
led
them
directly
into
the
town
of
regoa
through
the
mud
and
clay
of
the
deserted
narrow
unpaved
streets
the
dragoons
squelched
their
way
under
a
for
the
rain
was
now
reinforced
by
steady
and
overwhelming
sheets
of
water
descending
on
either
side
from
the
tiles
that
roofed
the
houses
inquisitive
faces
showed
here
and
there
behind
blurred
windows
odd
doors
were
opened
that
a
peasant
family
might
stare
in
questioning
wonder
and
perhaps
in
some
concern
at
the
sodden
pageant
that
was
passing
but
in
the
streets
themselves
the
troopers
met
no
living
thing
all
the
world
having
scurried
to
shelter
from
the
pitiless
downpour
beyond
the
town
they
were
brought
by
their
guide
to
a
walled
garden
and
halted
at
a
gateway
beyond
this
could
be
seen
a
fair
white
house
set
in
the
foreground
of
the
vineyards
that
rose
in
terraces
up
the
hillside
until
they
were
lost
from
sight
in
the
lowering
veils
of
mist
carved
on
the
granite
lintel
of
that
gateway
the
lieutenant
beheld
the
inscription
bartholomeu
bearsley
and
knew
himself
at
his
destination
at
the
gates
of
the
son
or
grandson
he
knew
not
which
nor
cared
of
the
original
tenant
of
that
wine
farm
bearsley
however
was
from
home
the
lieutenant
was
informed
of
this
by
bearsley
s
steward
a
portly
genial
rather
priestly
gentleman
in
smooth
black
broadcloth
whose
name
was
souza
a
name
which
as
i
have
said
has
given
rise
to
some
misconceptions
bearsley
himself
had
lately
left
for
england
there
to
wait
until
the
disturbed
state
of
portugal
should
be
happily
repaired
he
had
been
a
considerable
sufferer
from
the
french
invasion
under
soult
and
none
may
blame
him
for
wishing
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
what
already
he
had
undergone
especially
now
that
it
was
rumoured
that
the
emperor
in
person
would
lead
the
army
gathering
for
conquest
on
the
frontiers
but
had
bearsley
been
at
home
the
dragoons
could
have
received
no
warmer
welcome
than
that
which
was
extended
to
them
by
fernando
souza
greeting
the
lieutenant
in
intelligible
english
he
implored
him
in
the
florid
manner
of
the
peninsula
to
count
the
house
and
all
within
it
his
own
property
and
to
command
whatever
he
might
desire
the
troopers
found
accommodation
in
the
kitchen
and
in
the
spacious
hall
where
great
fires
of
pine
logs
were
piled
up
for
their
comfort
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
they
abode
there
in
various
states
of
nakedness
relieved
by
blankets
and
straw
capotes
what
time
the
house
was
filled
with
the
steam
and
stench
of
their
drying
garments
rations
had
been
short
of
late
on
the
agueda
and
in
addition
their
weary
ride
through
the
rain
had
made
the
men
abundance
of
food
was
placed
before
them
by
the
solicitude
of
fernando
souza
and
they
feasted
as
they
had
not
feasted
for
many
months
upon
roast
kid
boiled
rice
and
golden
maize
bread
washed
down
by
a
copious
supply
of
a
rough
and
not
too
heady
wine
that
the
discreet
and
discriminating
steward
judged
appropriate
to
their
palates
and
capable
of
supporting
some
abuse
akin
to
the
treatment
of
the
troopers
in
hall
and
kitchen
but
on
a
nobler
scale
was
the
treatment
of
lieutenant
butler
and
cornet
o
rourke
in
the
for
them
a
turkey
took
the
place
of
kid
and
souza
went
down
himself
to
explore
the
cellars
for
a
douro
table
wine
which
he
vowed
and
our
dragoons
agreed
with
him
would
put
the
noblest
burgundy
to
shame
and
then
with
the
dessert
there
was
a
port
the
like
of
which
butler
who
was
always
of
a
nice
taste
in
wine
and
who
was
coming
into
some
knowledge
of
port
from
his
residence
in
the
country
had
never
dreamed
existed
for
four
and
twenty
hours
the
dragoons
abode
at
bearsley
s
quinta
thanking
god
for
the
discomforts
that
had
brought
them
to
such
comfort
feasting
in
this
land
of
plenty
as
only
those
can
feast
who
have
kept
a
rigid
lent
nor
was
this
all
the
benign
souza
was
determined
that
the
sojourn
there
of
these
representatives
of
his
country
s
deliverers
should
be
a
complete
rest
and
holiday
not
for
butler
to
journey
to
the
uplands
in
this
matter
of
a
herd
of
bullocks
fernando
souza
had
at
command
a
regiment
of
labourers
who
were
idle
at
this
time
of
year
and
whom
his
good
nature
would
engage
on
behalf
of
his
english
guests
let
the
lieutenant
do
no
more
than
provide
the
necessary
money
for
the
cattle
and
the
rest
should
happen
as
by
enchantment
and
souza
himself
would
see
to
it
that
the
price
was
fair
and
proper
the
lieutenant
asked
no
better
he
had
no
great
opinion
of
himself
either
as
cattle
dealer
or
cattle
drover
nor
did
his
ambitions
beget
in
him
any
desire
to
excel
as
one
or
the
other
so
he
was
well
content
that
his
host
should
have
the
bullocks
fetched
to
regoa
for
him
the
herd
was
driven
in
on
the
following
afternoon
by
when
the
rain
had
ceased
and
our
lieutenant
had
every
reason
to
be
pleased
when
he
beheld
the
solid
beasts
procured
having
disbursed
the
amount
demanded
an
amount
more
reasonable
far
than
he
had
been
prepared
to
pay
butler
would
have
set
out
forthwith
to
return
to
pinhel
knowing
how
urgent
was
the
need
of
the
division
and
with
what
impatience
the
choleric
general
craufurd
would
be
awaiting
him
why
so
you
shall
so
you
shall
said
the
priestly
soothing
souza
but
first
you
ll
dine
there
is
good
dinner
ah
but
what
good
dinner
that
i
have
order
and
there
is
a
wine
ah
but
you
shall
give
me
news
of
that
lieutenant
butler
hesitated
cornet
o
rourke
watched
him
anxiously
praying
that
he
might
succumb
to
the
temptation
and
attempted
suasion
in
the
form
of
a
murmured
blessing
upon
souza
s
hospitality
sir
robert
will
be
impatient
demurred
the
lieutenant
but
protested
souza
what
is
and
in
you
will
have
true
ventured
the
cornet
and
it
s
the
devil
himself
knows
when
we
may
dine
and
the
dinner
is
ready
it
can
be
serve
this
instant
it
shall
said
souza
with
finality
and
pulled
the
butler
never
dreaming
as
indeed
how
could
he
that
fate
was
taking
a
hand
in
this
business
gave
way
and
they
sat
down
to
dinner
henceforth
you
see
him
the
sport
of
pitiless
circumstance
they
dined
within
the
as
souza
had
promised
and
they
dined
exceedingly
well
if
yesterday
the
steward
had
been
able
without
warning
of
their
coming
to
spread
at
short
notice
so
excellent
a
feast
conceive
what
had
been
accomplished
now
by
preparation
emptying
his
fourth
and
final
bumper
of
rich
red
douro
butler
paid
his
host
the
compliment
of
a
sigh
and
pushed
back
his
chair
but
souza
detained
him
waving
a
hand
that
trembled
with
anxiety
and
with
anxiety
stamped
upon
his
benignly
rotund
and
shaven
countenance
an
instant
yet
he
implored
mr
bearsley
would
never
pardon
me
did
i
let
you
go
without
what
he
call
a
to
keep
you
from
the
ills
that
lurk
in
the
wind
of
the
serra
a
glass
but
one
of
that
port
you
tasted
yesterday
i
say
but
a
glass
yet
i
hope
you
will
do
honour
to
the
bottle
but
a
glass
at
least
at
least
he
implored
it
almost
with
tears
butler
had
reached
that
state
of
delicious
torpor
in
which
to
take
the
road
is
the
last
agony
but
duty
was
duty
and
sir
robert
craufurd
had
the
fiend
s
own
temper
torn
thus
between
consciousness
of
duty
and
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
he
looked
at
o
rourke
o
rourke
a
cherubic
fellow
who
had
for
his
years
a
very
pretty
taste
in
wine
returned
the
glance
with
a
moist
eye
and
licked
his
lips
in
your
place
i
should
let
myself
be
tempted
says
he
it
s
an
elegant
wine
and
ten
minutes
more
or
less
is
no
great
the
lieutenant
discovered
a
middle
way
which
permitted
him
to
take
a
prompt
decision
creditable
to
his
military
instincts
but
revealing
a
disgraceful
though
quite
characteristic
selfishness
very
well
he
said
leave
sergeant
flanagan
and
ten
men
to
wait
for
me
o
rourke
and
do
you
set
out
at
once
with
the
rest
of
the
troop
and
take
the
cattle
with
you
i
shall
overtake
you
before
you
have
gone
very
o
rourke
s
crestfallen
air
stirred
the
sympathetic
souza
s
pity
but
captain
he
besought
will
you
not
allow
the
lieutenant
butler
cut
him
short
duty
said
he
sententiously
is
duty
be
off
o
and
o
rourke
clicking
his
heels
viciously
saluted
and
departed
came
presently
the
bottles
in
a
basket
not
one
as
souza
had
said
but
three
and
when
the
first
was
done
butler
reflected
that
since
o
rourke
and
the
cattle
were
already
well
upon
the
road
there
need
no
longer
be
any
hurry
about
his
own
departure
a
herd
of
bullocks
does
not
travel
very
quickly
and
even
with
a
few
hours
start
in
a
journey
is
easily
by
a
troop
of
horse
travelling
without
encumbrance
you
understand
then
how
easily
our
lieutenant
yielded
himself
to
the
luxurious
circumstances
and
disposed
himself
to
savour
the
second
bottle
of
that
nectar
distilled
from
the
very
sunshine
of
the
douro
the
phrase
is
his
own
the
steward
produced
a
box
of
very
choice
cigars
and
although
the
lieutenant
was
not
an
habitual
smoker
he
permitted
himself
on
this
exceptional
occasion
to
be
further
tempted
stretched
in
a
deep
chair
beside
the
roaring
fire
of
pine
logs
he
sipped
and
smoked
and
drowsed
away
the
greater
par
of
that
wintry
afternoon
soon
the
third
bottle
had
gone
the
way
of
the
second
and
bearsley
s
steward
being
a
man
of
extremely
temperate
habit
it
follows
that
most
of
the
wine
had
found
its
way
down
the
lieutenant
s
thirsty
gullet
it
was
perhaps
a
more
potent
vintage
than
he
had
at
first
suspected
and
as
the
torpor
produced
by
the
dinner
and
the
earlier
fuller
wine
was
wearing
off
it
was
succeeded
by
an
exhilaration
that
played
havoc
with
the
few
wits
that
butler
could
call
his
own
the
steward
was
deeply
learned
in
wines
and
wine
growing
and
in
very
little
besides
consequently
the
talk
was
almost
confined
to
that
subject
in
its
many
branches
and
he
could
be
interesting
enough
like
all
enthusiasts
to
a
fresh
burst
of
praise
from
butler
of
the
ruby
vintage
to
which
he
had
been
introduced
the
steward
presently
responded
with
a
sigh
indeed
as
you
say
captain
a
great
wine
but
we
had
a
impossible
by
god
swore
butler
with
a
hiccup
you
may
say
so
but
it
is
the
truth
we
had
a
greater
a
wonderful
clear
vintage
it
was
of
the
year
a
famous
year
on
the
douro
the
quite
most
famous
year
that
we
have
ever
known
bearsley
sell
some
pipes
to
the
monks
at
tavora
who
have
bottle
it
and
keep
it
i
beg
him
at
the
time
not
to
sell
knowing
the
value
it
must
come
to
have
one
day
but
he
sell
all
the
same
ah
meu
deus
the
steward
clasped
his
hands
and
raised
rather
prominent
eyes
to
the
ceiling
protesting
to
his
maker
against
his
master
s
folly
he
say
we
have
plenty
and
now
he
spread
fat
hands
in
a
gesture
of
despair
and
now
we
have
none
some
sons
of
dogs
of
french
who
came
with
marshal
soult
happen
this
way
on
a
forage
they
discover
the
wine
and
they
guzzle
it
like
he
swore
and
his
benignity
was
eclipsed
by
wrathful
memory
he
heaved
himself
up
in
a
passion
think
of
that
so
priceless
vintage
drink
like
hogwash
as
bearsley
say
by
those
french
swine
not
a
drop
not
a
spoonful
remain
but
the
monks
at
tavora
still
have
much
of
what
they
buy
i
am
told
they
treasure
it
for
they
know
good
wine
all
priests
know
good
wine
ah
yes
goddam
he
fell
into
deep
reflection
lieutenant
butler
stirred
and
became
sympathetic
san
infern
l
shame
said
he
indignantly
i
ll
no
forgerrit
when
i
meet
the
then
he
too
fell
into
reflection
he
was
a
good
catholic
and
moreover
a
catholic
who
did
not
take
things
for
granted
the
sloth
and
of
the
clergy
in
portugal
being
his
first
glimpse
of
conventuals
in
latin
countries
had
deeply
shocked
him
the
vows
of
a
monastic
poverty
that
was
kept
carefully
beyond
the
walls
of
the
monastery
offended
his
sense
of
propriety
that
men
who
had
vowed
themselves
to
pauperism
who
wore
coarse
garments
and
went
barefoot
should
batten
upon
rich
food
and
store
up
wines
that
gold
could
not
purchase
struck
him
as
a
hideous
incongruity
and
the
monks
drink
this
nectar
he
said
aloud
and
laughed
sneeringly
i
know
the
breed
the
fair
found
belly
wi
fat
capon
lined
tha
s
your
poverty
stricken
souza
looked
at
him
in
sudden
alarm
bethinking
himself
that
all
englishmen
were
heretics
and
knowing
nothing
of
subtle
distinctions
between
english
and
irish
in
silence
butler
finished
the
third
and
last
bottle
and
his
thoughts
fixed
themselves
with
increasing
insistence
upon
a
wine
reputed
better
than
this
of
which
there
was
great
store
in
the
cellars
of
the
convent
of
tavora
abruptly
he
asked
where
s
tavora
he
was
thinking
perhaps
of
the
comfort
that
such
wine
would
bring
to
a
company
of
soldiers
in
the
valley
of
the
agueda
some
ten
leagues
from
here
answered
souza
and
pointed
to
a
map
that
hung
upon
the
wall
the
lieutenant
rose
and
rolled
a
thought
unsteadily
across
the
room
he
was
a
tall
fellow
with
a
thatch
of
fiery
red
hair
excellently
suited
to
his
temperament
he
halted
before
the
map
and
with
legs
wide
apart
to
afford
him
the
steadying
support
of
a
broad
basis
he
traced
with
his
finger
the
course
of
the
douro
fumbled
about
the
district
of
regoa
and
finally
hit
upon
the
place
he
sought
why
he
said
seems
to
me
sif
we
should
ha
come
that
way
i
s
shorrer
road
to
pesqueira
than
by
the
as
the
bird
fly
said
souza
but
the
roads
be
bad
just
mule
tracks
while
by
the
river
the
road
is
tolerable
yet
said
the
lieutenant
i
think
i
shall
go
back
tha
the
fumes
of
the
wine
were
mounting
steadily
to
addle
his
indifferent
brains
every
moment
he
was
seeing
things
in
proportions
more
and
more
false
his
resentment
against
priests
who
sworn
to
hoarded
good
wine
whilst
soldiers
sent
to
keep
harm
from
priests
fat
carcasses
were
left
to
suffer
cold
and
even
hunger
was
increasing
with
every
moment
he
would
sample
that
wine
at
tavora
and
he
would
bear
some
of
it
away
that
his
brother
officers
at
pinhel
might
sample
it
he
would
buy
it
oh
yes
there
should
be
no
plundering
no
irregularity
no
disregard
of
general
orders
he
would
buy
the
wine
and
pay
for
it
but
himself
he
would
fix
the
price
and
see
that
the
monks
of
tavora
made
no
profit
out
of
their
defenders
thus
he
thought
as
he
considered
the
map
presently
when
having
taken
leave
of
fernando
souza
that
prince
of
hosts
butler
was
riding
down
through
the
town
with
sergeant
flanagan
and
ten
troopers
at
his
heels
his
purpose
deepened
and
became
more
fierce
i
think
the
change
of
temperature
must
have
been
to
blame
it
was
a
chill
bleak
evening
overhead
across
a
background
of
faded
blue
scudded
ragged
banks
of
clouds
the
lingering
flotsam
of
the
shattered
rainstorm
of
yesterday
and
a
cavalry
cloak
afforded
but
indifferent
protection
against
the
wind
that
blew
hard
and
sharp
from
the
atlantic
coming
from
the
genial
warmth
of
souza
s
parlour
into
this
the
evaporation
of
the
wine
within
him
was
quickened
its
fumes
mounted
now
overwhelmingly
to
his
brain
and
from
comfortably
intoxicated
that
he
had
been
hitherto
the
lieutenant
now
became
furiously
drunk
and
the
transition
was
a
very
rapid
one
it
was
now
that
he
looked
upon
the
business
he
had
in
hand
in
the
light
of
a
crusade
a
sort
of
religious
fanaticism
began
to
actuate
him
the
souls
of
these
wretched
monks
must
be
saved
the
temptation
to
which
spelt
perdition
for
them
must
be
removed
from
their
midst
it
was
a
christian
duty
he
no
longer
thought
of
buying
the
wine
and
paying
for
it
his
one
aim
now
was
to
obtain
possession
of
it
not
merely
a
part
of
it
but
all
of
it
and
carry
it
off
thereby
accomplishing
two
equally
praiseworthy
ends
to
rescue
a
conventful
of
monks
from
damnation
and
to
regale
the
campaigners
of
the
agueda
thus
reasoned
butler
with
admirable
if
drunken
logic
and
reasoning
thus
he
led
the
way
over
the
bridge
and
kept
straight
on
when
he
had
crossed
it
much
to
the
dismay
of
sergeant
flanagan
who
perceiving
the
lieutenant
s
condition
conceived
that
he
was
missing
his
way
this
the
sergeant
ventured
to
point
out
reminding
his
officer
that
they
had
come
by
the
road
along
the
river
so
we
did
said
butler
shortly
bu
we
go
back
by
way
of
they
had
no
guide
the
one
who
had
conducted
them
to
regoa
had
returned
with
o
rourke
and
although
souza
had
urged
upon
the
lieutenant
at
parting
that
he
should
take
one
of
the
men
from
the
quinta
butler
with
wit
enough
to
see
that
this
was
not
desirable
under
the
circumstances
had
preferred
to
find
his
way
alone
his
confused
mind
strove
now
to
revisualise
the
map
which
he
had
consulted
in
souza
s
parlour
he
discovered
naturally
enough
that
the
task
was
altogether
beyond
his
powers
meanwhile
night
was
descending
they
were
however
upon
the
mule
track
which
went
up
and
round
the
shoulder
of
a
hill
and
by
this
they
came
at
dark
upon
a
hamlet
sergeant
flanagan
was
a
shrewd
fellow
and
perhaps
the
most
sober
man
in
the
troop
for
the
wine
had
run
very
freely
in
souza
s
kitchen
too
and
the
men
whilst
awaiting
their
commander
s
pleasure
had
taken
the
fullest
advantage
of
an
opportunity
that
was
all
too
rare
upon
that
campaign
now
sergeant
flanagan
began
to
grow
anxious
he
knew
the
peninsula
from
the
days
of
sir
john
moore
and
he
knew
as
much
of
the
ways
of
the
peasantry
of
portugal
as
any
man
he
knew
of
the
brutal
ferocity
of
which
that
peasantry
was
capable
he
had
seen
evidence
more
than
once
of
the
unspeakable
fate
of
french
stragglers
from
the
retreating
army
of
marshal
soult
he
knew
of
crucifixions
mutilations
and
hideous
abominations
practised
upon
them
in
these
remote
hill
districts
by
the
merciless
men
into
whose
hands
they
happened
to
fall
and
he
knew
that
it
was
not
upon
french
soldiers
alone
that
these
abominations
had
been
practised
some
of
those
fierce
peasants
had
been
unable
to
discriminate
between
invader
and
deliverer
to
them
a
foreigner
was
a
foreigner
and
no
more
others
who
were
capable
of
discriminating
were
in
the
position
of
having
come
to
look
upon
french
and
english
with
almost
equal
execration
it
is
true
that
whilst
the
emperor
s
troops
made
war
on
the
maxim
that
an
army
must
support
itself
upon
the
country
it
traverses
thereby
achieving
a
greater
mobility
since
it
was
thus
permitted
to
travel
comparatively
light
the
british
law
was
that
all
things
requisitioned
must
be
paid
for
wellington
maintained
this
law
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
at
all
times
with
an
unrelaxing
rigidity
and
punished
with
the
utmost
vigour
those
who
offended
against
it
nevertheless
breaches
were
continual
men
broke
out
here
and
there
often
be
it
said
under
stress
of
circumstances
for
which
the
portuguese
were
themselves
responsible
plunder
and
outrage
took
place
and
provoked
indiscriminating
rancour
with
consequences
at
times
as
terrible
to
stragglers
from
the
british
army
of
deliverance
as
to
those
from
the
french
army
of
oppressors
then
too
there
was
the
portuguese
militia
act
recently
enforced
by
wellington
acting
through
the
portuguese
government
deeply
resented
by
the
peasantry
upon
whom
it
bore
and
rendering
them
disposed
to
avenge
it
upon
such
stray
british
soldiers
as
might
fall
into
their
hands
knowing
all
this
sergeant
flanagan
did
not
at
all
relish
this
night
excursion
into
the
hill
fastnesses
where
at
any
moment
as
it
seemed
to
him
they
might
miss
their
way
after
all
they
were
but
twelve
men
all
told
and
he
accounted
it
a
stupid
thing
to
attempt
to
take
a
short
cut
across
the
hills
for
the
purpose
of
overtaking
an
encumbered
troop
that
must
of
necessity
be
moving
at
a
very
much
slower
pace
this
was
the
way
not
to
overtake
but
to
outdistance
yet
since
it
was
not
for
him
to
remonstrate
with
the
lieutenant
he
kept
his
peace
and
hoped
anxiously
for
the
best
at
the
mean
of
that
hamlet
butler
inquired
his
way
by
the
simple
expedient
of
shouting
tavora
with
a
strong
interrogative
inflection
the
vintner
made
it
plain
by
gestures
accompanied
by
a
rattling
musketry
of
incomprehensible
speech
that
their
way
lay
straight
ahead
and
straight
ahead
they
went
following
that
mule
track
for
some
five
or
six
miles
until
it
began
to
slope
gently
towards
the
plain
again
below
them
they
presently
beheld
a
cluster
of
twinkling
lights
to
advertise
a
township
they
dropped
swiftly
down
and
in
the
outskirts
overtook
a
belated
whose
ungreased
axle
was
arousing
the
hillside
echoes
with
its
plangent
wail
of
the
vigorous
young
woman
who
marched
barefoot
beside
it
shouldering
her
goad
as
if
it
were
a
pikestaff
butler
inquired
by
his
usual
method
if
this
were
tavora
to
receive
an
answer
which
though
voluble
was
unmistakably
affirmative
covento
dominicano
was
his
next
inquiry
made
after
they
had
gone
some
little
way
the
woman
pointed
with
her
goad
to
a
massive
dark
building
flanked
by
a
little
church
which
stood
just
across
the
square
they
were
entering
a
moment
later
the
sergeant
by
butler
s
orders
was
knocking
upon
the
main
door
they
waited
awhile
in
vain
none
came
to
answer
the
knock
no
light
showed
anywhere
upon
the
dark
face
of
the
convent
the
sergeant
knocked
again
more
vigorously
than
before
presently
came
timid
shuffling
steps
a
shutter
opened
in
the
door
and
the
grille
thus
disclosed
was
pierced
by
a
shaft
of
feeble
yellow
light
a
quavering

the

echo

evoked
no

if

completely

to
me
that

some
of
the

carried
axes
precisely
against
such
an
emergency
as
this

they
fell
upon
the
door
with
a
will
but
the
oak
was
stout
fortified
by
bands
of
iron
and
great
iron
studs
and
it
resisted
long
the
thud
of
the
axes
and
the
crash
of
rending
timbers
could
be
heard
from
one
end
of
tavora
to
the
other
yet
from
the
convent
it
evoked
no
slightest
response
but
presently
as
the
door
began
to
yield
to
the
onslaught
there
came
another
sound
to
arouse
the
town
from
the
belfry
of
the
little
church
a
bell
suddenly
gave
tongue
upon
a
frantic
hurried
note
that
spoke
unmistakably
of
alarm
it
went
a
tocsin
summoning
the
assistance
of
all
true
sons
of
mother
church
butler
however
paid
little
heed
to
it
the
door
was
down
at
last
and
followed
by
his
troopers
he
rode
under
the
massive
gateway
into
the
spacious
close
dismounting
there
and
leaving
the
woefully
anxious
sergeant
and
a
couple
of
men
to
guard
the
horses
the
lieutenant
led
the
way
along
the
cloisters
faintly
revealed
by
a
moon
towards
a
gaping
doorway
whence
a
feeble
light
was
gleaming
he
stumbled
over
the
step
into
a
hall
dimly
lighted
by
a
lantern
swinging
from
the
ceiling
he
found
a
chair
mounted
it
and
cut
the
lantern
down
then
led
the
way
again
along
an
endless
corridor
and
flanked
on
either
side
by
rows
of
cells
many
of
the
doors
stood
open
as
if
in
silent
token
of
the
tenants
hurried
flight
showing
what
a
panic
had
been
spread
by
the
sudden
advent
of
this
troop
butler
became
more
and
more
deeply
intrigued
more
and
more
deeply
suspicious
that
here
all
was
not
well
why
should
a
community
of
loyal
monks
take
flight
in
this
fashion
from
british
soldiers
bad
luck
to
them
he
growled
as
he
stumbled
on
they
may
hide
as
they
will
but
it
s
myself
ll
run
the
shavelings
to
they
were
brought
up
short
at
the
end
of
that
long
chill
gallery
by
closed
double
doors
beyond
these
an
organ
was
pealing
and
overhead
the
clapper
of
the
alarm
bell
was
beating
more
furiously
than
ever
all
realised
that
they
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
the
chapel
and
that
the
conventuals
had
taken
refuge
there
butler
checked
upon
a
sudden
suspicion
maybe
after
all
they
ve
taken
us
for
french
said
he
a
trooper
ventured
to
answer
him
best
let
them
see
we
re
not
before
we
have
the
whole
village
about
our
damn
that
bell
said
the
lieutenant
and
added
put
your
shoulders
to
the
its
fastenings
were
but
crazy
ones
and
it
yielded
almost
instantly
to
their
pressure
yielded
so
suddenly
that
butler
who
himself
had
been
foremost
in
straining
against
it
shot
forward
yards
into
the
chapel
and
measured
his
length
upon
its
cold
flags
simultaneously
from
the
chancel
came
a
great
cry
libera
nos
domine
followed
by
a
shuddering
murmur
of
prayer
the
lieutenant
picked
himself
up
recovered
the
lantern
that
had
rolled
from
his
grasp
and
lurched
forward
round
the
angle
that
hid
the
chancel
from
his
view
there
huddled
before
the
main
altar
like
a
flock
of
scared
and
stupid
sheep
he
beheld
the
conventuals
some
two
score
of
them
perhaps
and
in
the
dim
light
of
the
heavy
altar
lamp
above
them
he
could
make
out
the
black
and
white
habit
of
the
order
of
dominic
he
came
to
a
halt
raised
his
lantern
aloft
and
called
to
them
peremptorily
ho
there
the
organ
ceased
abruptly
but
the
bell
overhead
went
clattering
on
butler
addressed
them
in
the
best
french
he
could
command
what
do
you
fear
why
do
you
flee
we
are
friends
english
soldiers
seeking
quarters
for
the
a
vague
alarm
was
stirring
in
him
it
began
to
penetrate
his
obfuscated
mind
that
perhaps
he
had
been
rash
that
this
forcible
rape
of
a
convent
was
a
serious
matter
therefore
he
attempted
this
peaceful
explanation
from
that
huddled
group
a
figure
rose
and
advanced
with
a
solemn
stately
grace
there
was
a
faint
swish
of
robes
the
faint
rattle
of
rosary
beads
something
about
that
figure
caught
the
lieutenant
s
attention
sharply
he
craned
forward
half
sobered
by
the
sudden
fear
that
clutched
him
his
eyes
bulging
in
his
face
i
had
thought
said
a
gentle
melancholy
woman
s
voice
that
the
seals
of
a
nunnery
were
sacred
to
british
for
a
moment
butler
seemed
to
be
labouring
for
breath
fully
sobered
now
understanding
of
his
ghastly
error
reached
him
at
the
gallop
my
god
he
gasped
and
incontinently
turned
to
flee
but
as
he
fled
in
horror
of
his
sacrilege
he
still
kept
his
head
turned
staring
over
his
shoulder
at
the
stately
figure
of
the
abbess
either
in
fascination
or
with
some
lingering
doubt
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
running
thus
he
crashed
headlong
into
a
pillar
and
stunned
by
the
blow
he
reeled
and
sank
unconscious
to
the
ground
this
the
troopers
had
not
seen
for
they
had
not
lingered
understanding
on
their
own
part
the
horrible
blunder
they
had
turned
even
as
their
leader
turned
and
they
had
raced
madly
back
the
way
they
had
come
conceiving
that
he
followed
and
there
was
reason
for
their
haste
other
than
their
anxiety
to
set
a
term
to
the
sacrilege
of
their
presence
from
the
cloistered
garden
of
the
convent
uproar
reached
them
and
the
metallic
voice
of
sergeant
flanagan
calling
loudly
for
help
the
alarm
bell
of
the
convent
had
done
its
work
the
villagers
were
up
enraged
by
the
outrage
and
armed
with
sticks
and
scythes
and
an
army
of
them
was
charging
to
avenge
this
infamy
the
troopers
reached
the
close
no
more
than
in
time
sergeant
flanagan
only
half
understanding
the
reason
for
so
much
anger
but
understanding
that
this
anger
was
very
real
and
very
dangerous
was
desperately
defending
the
horses
with
his
two
companions
against
the
vanguard
of
the
assailants
there
was
a
swift
rush
of
the
dragoons
and
in
an
instant
they
were
in
the
saddle
all
but
the
lieutenant
of
whose
absence
they
were
suddenly
made
conscious
flanagan
would
have
gone
back
for
him
and
he
had
in
fact
begun
to
issue
an
order
with
that
object
when
a
sudden
surge
of
the
swelling
roaring
crowd
cut
off
the
dragoons
from
the
door
through
which
they
had
emerged
sitting
their
horses
the
little
troop
came
together
their
sabres
drawn
solid
as
a
rock
in
that
angry
human
sea
that
surged
about
them
the
moon
riding
now
clear
overhead
irradiated
that
scene
of
impending
strife
flanagan
standing
in
his
stirrups
attempted
to
harangue
the
mob
but
he
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
that
would
appease
them
nor
able
to
speak
a
language
they
could
understand
an
angry
peasant
made
a
slash
at
him
with
a
billhook
he
parried
the
blow
on
his
sabre
and
with
the
flat
of
it
knocked
his
assailant
senseless
then
the
storm
burst
and
the
mob
flung
itself
upon
the
dragoons
bad
cess
to
you
cried
flanagan
will
ye
listen
to
me
ye
murthering
then
in
despair
he
roared
and
headed
for
the
gateway
the
troopers
attempted
in
vain
to
reach
it
the
mob
hemmed
them
about
too
closely
and
then
a
horrid
fight
began
under
the
cold
light
of
the
moon
in
that
garden
consecrated
to
peace
and
piety
two
saddles
had
been
emptied
and
the
exasperated
troopers
were
slashing
now
at
their
assailants
with
the
edge
intent
upon
cutting
a
way
out
of
that
murderous
press
it
is
doubtful
if
a
man
of
them
would
have
survived
for
the
odds
were
fully
ten
to
one
against
them
to
their
aid
came
now
the
abbess
she
stood
on
a
balcony
above
and
called
upon
the
people
to
desist
and
hear
her
thence
she
harangued
them
for
some
moments
commanding
them
to
allow
the
soldiers
to
depart
they
obeyed
with
obvious
reluctance
and
at
last
a
lane
was
opened
in
that
solid
seething
mass
of
angry
clods
but
flanagan
hesitated
to
pass
down
this
lane
and
so
depart
three
of
his
troopers
were
down
by
now
and
his
lieutenant
was
missing
he
was
exercised
to
resolve
where
his
duty
lay
behind
him
the
mob
was
solid
cutting
off
the
dragoons
from
their
fallen
comrades
an
attempt
to
go
back
might
be
misunderstood
and
resisted
leading
to
a
renewal
of
the
combat
and
surely
in
vain
for
he
could
not
doubt
but
that
the
fallen
troopers
had
been
finished
outright
similarly
the
mob
stood
as
solid
between
him
and
the
door
that
led
to
the
interior
of
the
convent
where
butler
was
lingering
alive
or
dead
a
number
of
peasants
had
already
invaded
the
actual
building
so
that
in
that
connection
too
the
sergeant
concluded
that
there
was
little
reason
to
hope
that
the
lieutenant
should
have
escaped
the
fate
his
own
rashness
had
invoked
he
had
his
remaining
seven
men
to
think
of
and
he
concluded
that
it
was
his
duty
under
all
the
circumstances
to
bring
these
off
alive
and
not
procure
their
massacre
by
attempting
fruitless
quixotries
so
forward
roared
the
voice
of
sergeant
flanagan
and
forward
went
the
seven
through
the
passage
that
had
opened
out
before
them
in
that
hooting
angry
mob
beyond
the
convent
walls
they
found
fresh
assailants
awaiting
them
enemies
these
who
had
not
been
soothed
by
the
gentle
reassuring
voice
of
the
abbess
but
here
there
was
more
room
to
manoeuvre
trot
the
sergeant
commanded
and
soon
that
trot
became
a
gallop
a
shower
of
stones
followed
them
as
they
thundered
out
of
tavora
and
the
sergeant
himself
had
a
lump
as
large
as
a
on
the
middle
of
his
head
when
next
day
he
reported
himself
at
pesqueira
to
cornet
o
rourke
whom
he
overtook
there
when
eventually
sir
robert
craufurd
heard
the
story
of
the
affair
he
was
as
angry
as
only
sir
robert
could
be
to
have
lost
four
dragoons
and
to
have
set
a
match
to
a
train
that
might
end
in
a
conflagration
was
reason
and
to
spare
how
came
such
a
mistake
to
be
made
he
inquired
a
scowl
upon
his
full
red
countenance
o
rourke
had
been
investigating
and
was
primed
with
knowledge
it
appears
sir
that
at
tavora
there
is
a
convent
of
dominican
nuns
as
well
as
a
monastery
of
dominican
friars
butler
will
have
used
the
word
convento
which
more
particularly
applies
to
the
nunnery
and
so
he
was
directed
to
the
wrong
and
you
say
the
sergeant
has
reason
to
believe
that
butler
did
not
survive
his
folly
i
am
afraid
there
can
be
no
hope
it
s
perhaps
just
as
well
said
sir
robert
for
lord
wellington
would
certainly
have
had
him
and
there
you
have
the
true
account
of
the
stupid
affair
of
tavora
which
was
to
produce
as
we
shall
see
such
effects
upon
persons
nowise
concerned
in
it
chapter
ii
the
ultimatum
news
of
the
affair
at
tavora
reached
sir
terence
o
moy
the
at
lisbon
about
a
week
later
in
dispatches
from
headquarters
these
informed
him
that
in
the
course
of
the
humble
apology
and
explanation
of
the
regrettable
occurrence
offered
by
the
colonel
of
the
dragoons
in
person
to
the
mother
abbess
it
had
transpired
that
lieutenant
butler
had
left
the
convent
alive
but
that
nevertheless
he
continued
absent
from
his
regiment
those
dispatches
contained
other
unpleasant
matters
of
a
totally
different
nature
with
which
sir
terence
must
proceed
to
deal
at
once
but
their
gravity
was
completely
outweighed
in
the
adjutant
s
mind
by
this
deplorable
affair
of
lieutenant
butler
s
without
wishing
to
convey
an
impression
that
the
blunt
and
downright
o
moy
was
gifted
with
any
undue
measure
of
shrewdness
it
must
nevertheless
be
said
that
he
was
quick
to
perceive
what
fresh
thorns
the
occurrence
was
likely
to
throw
in
a
path
that
was
already
thorny
enough
in
all
conscience
what
a
semblance
of
justification
it
must
give
to
the
hostility
of
the
intriguers
on
the
council
of
regency
what
a
formidable
weapon
it
must
place
in
the
hands
of
principal
souza
and
his
partisans
in
itself
this
was
enough
to
trouble
a
man
in
o
moy
s
position
but
there
was
more
lieutenant
butler
happened
to
be
his
own
brother
to
o
moy
s
lovely
frivolous
wife
irresponsibility
ran
strongly
in
that
branch
of
the
butler
family
for
the
sake
of
the
young
wife
whom
he
loved
with
a
passionate
and
fearful
jealousy
such
as
is
not
uncommon
in
a
man
of
o
moy
s
temperament
when
at
his
age
he
was
approaching
his
birthday
he
marries
a
girl
of
half
his
years
the
adjutant
had
pulled
his
out
of
many
a
difficulty
shielded
him
on
many
an
occasion
from
the
proper
consequences
of
his
incurable
rashness
this
affair
of
the
convent
however
transcended
anything
that
had
gone
before
and
proved
altogether
too
much
for
o
moy
it
angered
him
as
much
as
it
afflicted
him
yet
when
he
took
his
head
in
his
hands
and
groaned
it
was
only
his
sorrow
that
he
was
expressing
and
it
was
a
sorrow
entirely
concerned
with
his
wife
the
groan
attracted
the
attention
of
his
military
secretary
captain
tremayne
of
fletcher
s
engineers
who
sat
at
work
at
a
littered
placed
in
the
window
recess
he
looked
up
sharply
sudden
concern
in
the
strong
young
face
and
the
steady
grey
eyes
he
bent
upon
his
chief
the
sight
of
o
moy
s
hunched
attitude
brought
him
instantly
to
his
feet
whatever
is
the
matter
sir
it
s
that
damned
fool
richard
growled
o
moy
he
s
broken
out
the
captain
looked
relieved
and
is
that
all
o
moy
looked
at
him
and
in
his
blue
eyes
a
blaze
of
that
swift
passion
that
had
made
his
name
a
byword
in
the
army
all
he
roared
you
ll
say
it
s
enough
by
god
when
you
hear
what
the
fool
s
been
at
this
time

of

he
brought
his
massive
fist
down
with
a
crash
upon
the
document
that
had
conveyed

information

broke
into

night

week
ago
the

was

reported
to
have

from
the

but
understood
to
remain
in

that

desertion
to
the
other
crime
as
if
that
in
itself
were
not
enough
to
hang
him

as

you
consider
it

if
this
report
is
correct
some
explanation
he
broke
down
utterly
at
fault
to
be
sure
there
s
an
explanation
you
may
always
depend
upon
a
most
elegant
explanation
for
anything
that
dick
butler
does
his
life
is
made
up
of
mistakes
and
he
spoke
bitterly
he
broke
into
the
nunnery
under
a
misapprehension
according
to
the
account
of
the
sergeant
who
accompanied
him
and
sir
terence
read
out
that
part
of
the
report
but
how
is
that
to
help
him
and
at
such
a
time
as
this
with
public
feeling
as
it
is
and
wellington
in
his
present
temper
about
it
the
provost

men
are
beating
the
country
for
the
blackguard
when
they
find
him
it
s
a
firing
party
he

have
to
tremayne
turned
slowly
to
the
window
and
looked
down
the
fair
prospect
of
the
hillside
over
a
forest
of
cork
oaks
alive
with
fresh
green
shoots
to
the
silver
sheen
of
the
river
a
mile
away
the
storms
of
the
preceding
week
had
spent
their
fury
the
travail
that
had
attended
the
birth
of
spring
and
the
day
was
as
fair
as
a
day
of
june
in
england
weaned
forth
by
the
generous
sunshine
the
burgeoning
of
vine
and
fig
of
olive
and
cork
went
on
apace
and
the
skeletons
of
trees
which
a
fortnight
since
had
stood
gaunt
and
bare
were
already
fleshed
in
tender
green
from
the
window
of
this
fine
conventual
house
on
the
heights
of
monsanto
above
the
suburb
of
alcantara
where
the
had
taken
up
his
quarters
captain
tremayne
stood
a
moment
considering
the
panorama
spread
to
his
gaze
from
the
roofs
of
lisbon
on
his
left
that
city
which
boasted
with
rome
that
it
was
built
upon
a
cluster
of
seven
hills
to
the
lines
of
embarkation
that
were
building
about
the
fort
of
julian
on
his
left
then
he
turned
facing
again
the
spacious
handsome
room
with
its
heavy
furniture
and
sir
terence
who
hunched
in
his
chair
at
the
ponderously
carved
black
scowled
fiercely
at
nothing
what
are
you
going
to
do
sir
he
inquired
sir
terence
shrugged
impatiently
and
heaved
himself
up
in
his
chair
nothing
he
growled
nothing
the
interrogation
which
seemed
almost
to
cover
a
reproach
irritated
the
adjutant
and
what
the
devil
can
i
do
he
rapped
you
ve
pulled
dick
out
of
scrapes
before
i
have
that
seems
to
have
been
my
principal
occupation
ever
since
i
married
his
sister
but
this
time
he
s
gone
too
far
what
can
i
do
lord
wellington
is
fond
of
you
suggested
captain
tremayne
he
was
your
imperturbable
young
man
and
he
remained
as
calm
now
as
o
moy
was
excited
although
by
some
twenty
years
the
adjutant
s
junior
there
was
between
o
moy
and
himself
as
well
as
between
tremayne
and
the
butler
family
with
which
he
was
remotely
connected
a
strong
friendship
which
was
largely
responsible
for
the
captain
s
present
appointment
as
sir
terence
s
military
secretary
o
moy
looked
at
him
and
looked
away
yes
he
agreed
but
he
s
still
fonder
of
law
and
order
and
military
discipline
and
i
should
only
be
imperilling
our
friendship
by
pleading
with
him
for
this
young
the
young
blackguard
is
your
tremayne
reminded
him
bad
luck
to
you
tremayne
don
t
i
know
it
besides
what
is
there
i
can
do
he
asked
again
and
ended
testily
faith
man
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
thinking
i
m
thinking
of
una
said
captain
tremayne
in
that
composed
way
of
his
and
the
words
fell
like
cold
water
upon
the
hot
iron
of
o
moy
s
anger
the
man
who
can
receive
with
patience
a
reproach
implicit
or
explicit
of
being
wanting
in
consideration
towards
his
wife
is
comparatively
rare
and
never
a
man
of
o
moy
s
temperament
and
circumstances
tremayne
s
reminder
stung
him
sharply
and
the
more
sharply
because
of
the
strong
friendship
that
existed
between
tremayne
and
lady
o
moy
that
friendship
had
in
the
past
been
a
thorn
in
o
moy
s
flesh
in
the
days
of
his
courtship
he
had
known
a
fierce
jealousy
of
tremayne
beholding
in
him
for
a
time
a
rival
who
with
the
strong
advantage
of
youth
must
in
the
end
prevail
but
when
o
moy
putting
his
fortunes
to
the
test
had
declared
himself
and
been
accepted
by
una
butler
there
had
been
an
end
to
the
jealousy
and
the
old
relations
of
cordial
friendship
between
the
men
had
been
resumed
o
moy
had
conceived
that
jealousy
of
his
to
have
been
slain
but
there
had
been
times
when
from
its
faint
uneasy
stirrings
he
should
have
taken
warning
that
it
did
no
more
than
slumber
like
most
warm
hearted
generous
men
o
moy
was
of
a
singular
humility
where
women
were
concerned
and
this
humility
of
his
would
often
breathe
a
doubt
lest
in
choosing
between
himself
and
tremayne
una
might
have
been
guided
by
her
head
rather
than
her
heart
by
ambition
rather
than
affection
and
that
in
taking
himself
she
had
taken
the
man
who
could
give
her
by
far
the
more
assured
and
affluent
position
he
had
crushed
down
such
thoughts
as
disloyal
to
his
young
wife
as
ungrateful
and
unworthy
and
at
such
times
he
would
fall
into
for
having
entertained
them
then
una
herself
had
revived
those
doubts
three
months
ago
when
she
had
suggested
that
ned
tremayne
who
was
then
at
torres
vedras
with
colonel
fletcher
was
the
very
man
to
fill
the
vacant
place
of
military
secretary
to
the
adjutant
if
he
would
accept
it
in
the
reaction
of
and
in
a
curious
surge
of
pride
almost
as
perverse
as
his
humility
o
moy
had
adopted
her
suggestion
and
thereafter
in
the
months
that
is
to
say
the
unreasonable
devil
of
o
moy
s
jealousy
had
slept
almost
forgotten
now
by
a
chance
remark
whose
indiscretion
tremayne
could
not
realise
since
he
did
not
so
much
as
suspect
the
existence
of
that
devil
he
had
suddenly
prodded
him
into
wakefulness
that
tremayne
should
show
himself
tender
of
lady
o
moy
s
feelings
in
a
matter
in
which
o
moy
himself
must
seem
neglectful
of
them
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
the
adjutant
he
dissembled
it
however
out
of
a
natural
disinclination
to
appear
in
the
ridiculous
role
of
the
jealous
husband
that
he
said
is
a
matter
that
you
may
safely
leave
to
me
and
his
lips
closed
tightly
upon
the
words
when
they
were
uttered
oh
quite
so
said
tremayne
no
whit
abashed
he
persisted
nevertheless
you
know
una
s
feelings
for
when
i
married
una
the
adjutant
cut
in
sharply
i
did
not
marry
the
entire
butler
it
hardened
him
unreasonably
against
dick
to
have
the
family
cause
pleaded
in
this
way
it
s
sick
to
death
i
am
of
master
richard
and
his
escapades
he
can
get
himself
out
of
this
mess
or
he
can
stay
in
you
mean
that
you
ll
not
lift
a
hand
to
help
devil
a
finger
said
o
moy
and
tremayne
looking
straight
into
the
adjutant
s
faintly
smouldering
blue
eyes
beheld
there
a
fierce
and
rancorous
determination
which
he
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
but
which
he
attributed
to
something
outside
his
own
knowledge
that
must
lie
between
o
moy
and
his
i
am
sorry
he
said
gravely
since
that
is
how
you
feel
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
dick
butler
may
not
survive
to
be
taken
the
alternative
would
weigh
so
cruelly
upon
una
that
i
do
not
care
to
contemplate
and
who
the
devil
asks
you
to
contemplate
it
snapped
o
moy
i
am
not
aware
that
it
is
any
concern
of
yours
at
my
dear
o
moy
it
was
an
exclamation
of
protest
something
between
pain
and
indignation
under
the
stress
of
which
tremayne
stepped
entirely
outside
of
the
official
relations
that
prevailed
between
himself
and
the
adjutant
and
the
exclamation
was
accompanied
by
such
a
look
of
dismay
and
wounded
sensibilities
that
o
moy
meeting
this
and
noting
the
honest
manliness
of
tremayne
s
bearing
and
countenance
was
there
and
then
the
victim
of
reaction
his
and
impulsive
nature
made
him
at
once
profoundly
ashamed
of
himself
he
stood
up
a
tall
martial
figure
and
his
ruggedly
handsome
shaven
countenance
reddened
under
its
tan
he
held
out
a
hand
to
tremayne
my
dear
boy
i
beg
your
pardon
it
s
so
utterly
annoyed
i
am
that
the
savage
in
me
will
be
breaking
out
sure
it
isn
t
as
if
it
were
only
this
affair
of
dick
s
that
is
almost
the
least
part
of
the
unpleasantness
contained
in
this
dispatch
here
in
god
s
name
read
it
for
yourself
and
judge
for
yourself
whether
it
s
in
human
nature
to
be
patient
under
so
with
a
shrug
and
a
smile
to
show
that
he
was
entirely
mollified
captain
tremayne
took
the
papers
to
his
desk
and
sat
down
to
con
them
as
he
did
so
his
face
grew
more
and
more
grave
before
he
had
reached
the
end
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
an
orderly
entered
with
the
announcement
that
dom
miguel
forjas
had
just
driven
up
to
monsanto
to
wait
upon
the
ha
said
o
moy
shortly
and
exchanged
a
glance
with
his
secretary
show
the
gentleman
as
the
orderly
withdrew
tremayne
came
over
and
placed
the
dispatch
on
the
adjutant
s
desk
he
arrives
very
opportunely
he
said
so
opportunely
as
to
be
suspicious
bedad
said
o
moy
he
had
brightened
suddenly
his
irish
blood
quickening
at
the
immediate
prospect
of
strife
which
this
visit
boded
may
the
devil
admire
me
but
there
s
a
warm
morning
in
store
for
forjas
shall
i
leave
you
by
no
the
door
opened
and
the
orderly
admitted
miguel
forjas
the
portuguese
secretary
of
state
he
was
a
slight
dapper
gentleman
all
in
black
from
his
silk
stockings
and
shoes
to
his
satin
stock
his
keen
aquiline
face
was
swarthy
and
the
razor
had
left
his
chin
and
cheeks
his
sleek
hair
was
a
portentous
gravity
invested
him
this
morning
as
he
bowed
with
profound
deference
first
to
the
adjutant
and
then
to
the
secretary
your
excellencies
he
said
he
spoke
an
english
that
was
smooth
and
fluent
for
all
its
foreign
accent
your
excellencies
this
is
a
terrible
to
what
affair
will
your
excellency
be
alluding
wondered
o
moy
have
you
not
received
news
of
what
has
happened
at
tavora
of
the
violation
of
a
convent
by
a
party
of
british
soldiers
of
the
fight
that
took
place
between
these
soldiers
and
the
peasants
who
went
to
succour
the
nuns
oh
and
is
that
all
said
o
moy
for
a
moment
i
imagined
your
excellency
referred
to
other
matters
i
have
news
of
more
terrible
affairs
than
the
convent
business
with
which
to
entertain
you
this
that
if
you
will
pardon
me
sir
terence
is
quite
you
may
think
so
but
you
shall
judge
bedad
a
chair
dom
the
secretary
of
state
sat
down
crossed
his
knees
and
placed
his
hat
in
his
lap
the
other
two
resumed
their
seats
o
moy
leaning
forward
his
elbows
on
the
immediately
facing
senhor
forjas
first
however
he
said
to
deal
with
this
affair
of
tavora
the
council
of
regency
will
no
doubt
have
been
informed
of
all
the
circumstances
you
will
be
aware
therefore
that
this
very
deplorable
business
was
the
result
of
a
misapprehension
and
that
the
nuns
of
tavora
might
very
well
have
avoided
all
this
trouble
had
they
behaved
in
a
sensible
reasonable
manner
if
instead
of
shutting
themselves
up
in
the
chapel
and
ringing
the
alarm
bell
the
or
one
of
the
sisters
had
gone
to
the
wicket
and
answered
the
demand
of
admittance
from
the
officer
commanding
the
detachment
he
would
instantly
have
realised
his
mistake
and
what
does
your
excellency
suggest
was
this
mistake
inquired
the
secretary
you
have
had
your
report
sir
and
surely
it
was
complete
you
must
know
that
he
conceived
himself
to
be
knocking
at
the
gates
of
the
monastery
of
the
dominican
can
your
excellency
tell
me
what
was
this
officer
s
business
at
the
monastery
of
the
dominican
fathers
quoth
the
secretary
his
manner
frostily
hostile
i
am
without
information
on
that
point
o
moy
admitted
no
doubt
because
the
officer
in
question
is
missing
as
you
will
also
have
been
informed
but
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
whatever
his
business
may
have
been
it
was
concerned
with
the
interests
which
are
common
alike
to
the
british
and
the
portuguese
that
is
a
charitable
assumption
sir
perhaps
you
will
inform
me
dom
miguel
of
the
uncharitable
assumption
which
the
principal
souza
prefers
snapped
o
moy
whose
temper
began
to
simmer
a
faint
colour
kindled
in
the
cheeks
of
the
portuguese
minister
but
his
manner
remained
unruffled
i
speak
sir
not
with
the
voice
of
principal
souza
but
with
that
of
the
entire
council
of
regency
and
the
council
has
formed
the
opinion
which
your
own
words
confirm
that
his
excellency
lord
wellington
is
skilled
in
finding
excuses
for
the
misdemeanours
of
the
troops
under
his
that
said
o
moy
who
would
never
have
kept
his
temper
in
control
but
for
the
pleasant
consciousness
that
he
held
a
hand
of
trumps
with
which
he
would
presently
overwhelm
this
representative
of
the
portuguese
government
that
is
an
opinion
for
which
the
council
may
presently
like
to
apologise
admitting
its
entire
senhor
forjas
started
as
if
he
had
been
stung
he
uncrossed
his
black
silk
legs
and
made
as
if
to
rise
falsehood
sir
he
cried
in
a
scandalised
voice
it
is
as
well
that
we
should
be
plain
so
as
to
be
avoiding
all
misconceptions
said
o
moy
you
must
know
sir
and
your
council
must
know
that
wherever
armies
move
there
must
be
reason
for
complaint
the
british
army
does
not
claim
in
this
respect
to
be
superior
to
others
although
i
don
t
say
mark
me
that
it
might
not
claim
it
with
perfect
justice
but
we
do
claim
for
ourselves
that
our
laws
against
plunder
and
outrage
are
as
strict
as
they
well
can
be
and
that
where
these
things
take
place
punishment
inevitably
follows
out
of
your
own
knowledge
sir
you
must
admit
that
what
i
say
is
true
certainly
where
the
offenders
are
men
from
the
ranks
but
in
this
case
where
the
offender
is
an
officer
it
does
not
transpire
that
justice
has
been
administered
with
the
same
impartial
that
sir
answered
o
moy
sharply
testily
is
because
he
is
the
secretary
s
thin
lips
permitted
themselves
to
curve
into
the
faintest
ghost
of
a
smile
precisely
he
said
for
answer
o
moy
red
in
the
face
thrust
forward
the
dispatch
he
had
received
relating
to
the
affair
read
sir
read
for
yourself
that
you
may
report
exactly
to
the
council
of
regency
the
terms
of
the
report
that
has
just
reached
me
from
headquarters
you
will
be
able
to
announce
that
diligent
search
is
being
made
for
the
forjas
perused
the
document
carefully
and
returned
it
that
is
very
good
he
said
and
the
council
will
be
glad
to
hear
of
it
it
will
enable
us
to
appease
the
popular
resentment
in
some
degree
but
it
does
not
say
here
that
when
taken
this
officer
will
not
be
excused
upon
the
grounds
which
yourself
you
have
urged
to
it
does
not
but
considering
that
he
has
since
been
guilty
of
desertion
there
can
be
no
doubt
all
else
apart
that
the
finding
of
a
court
martial
will
result
in
his
being
very
well
said
forjas
i
will
accept
your
assurance
and
the
council
will
be
relieved
to
hear
of
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
i
am
desired
by
the
council
to
express
to
lord
wellington
the
hope
that
he
will
take
measures
to
preserve
better
order
among
his
troops
and
to
avoid
the
recurrence
of
such
extremely
painful
a
moment
said
o
moy
and
rising
waved
his
guest
back
into
his
chair
then
resumed
his
own
seat
under
a
more
or
less
calm
exterior
he
was
a
seething
cauldron
of
passion
the
matter
is
not
quite
at
an
end
as
your
excellency
supposes
from
your
last
observation
and
from
a
variety
of
other
evidence
i
infer
that
the
council
is
far
from
satisfied
with
lord
wellington
s
conduct
of
the
that
is
an
inference
which
i
can
not
venture
to
contradict
you
will
understand
general
that
i
do
not
speak
for
myself
but
for
the
council
when
i
say
that
many
of
his
measures
seem
to
us
not
merely
unnecessary
but
detrimental
the
power
having
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
lord
wellington
the
council
hardly
feels
itself
able
to
interfere
with
his
dispositions
but
it
nevertheless
deplores
the
destruction
of
the
mills
and
the
devastation
of
the
country
recommended
and
insisted
upon
by
his
lordship
it
feels
that
this
is
not
warfare
as
the
council
understands
warfare
and
the
people
share
the
feelings
of
the
council
it
is
felt
that
it
would
be
worthier
and
more
commendable
if
lord
wellington
were
to
measure
himself
in
battle
with
the
french
making
a
definite
attempt
to
stem
the
tide
of
invasion
on
the
quite
so
said
o
moy
his
hand
clenching
and
unclenching
and
tremayne
who
watched
him
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
storm
burst
quite
so
and
because
the
council
disapproves
of
the
very
measures
which
at
lord
wellington
s
instigation
it
has
publicly
recommended
it
does
not
trouble
to
see
that
those
measures
are
carried
out
as
you
say
it
does
not
feel
itself
able
to
interfere
with
his
dispositions
but
it
does
not
scruple
to
mark
its
disapproval
by
passively
hindering
him
at
every
turn
magistrates
are
left
to
neglect
these
enactments
and
because
he
added
with
bitter
sarcasm
portuguese
valour
is
so
and
so
devilish
set
on
battle
the
militia
acts
calling
all
men
to
the
colours
are
forgotten
as
soon
as
published
there
is
no
one
either
to
compel
the
recalcitrant
to
take
up
arms
or
to
punish
the
desertions
of
those
who
have
been
driven
into
taking
them
up
yet
you
want
battles
you
want
your
frontiers
defended
a
moment
sir
there
is
no
need
for
heat
no
need
for
any
words
the
matter
may
be
said
to
be
at
an
he
smiled
a
thought
viciously
be
it
confessed
and
then
played
his
trump
card
hurled
his
bombshell
since
the
views
of
your
council
are
in
such
utter
opposition
to
the
views
of
the
you
will
no
doubt
welcome
lord
wellington
s
proposal
to
withdraw
from
this
country
and
to
advise
his
majesty
s
government
to
withdraw
the
assistance
which
it
is
affording
there
followed
a
long
spell
of
silence
o
moy
sitting
back
in
his
chair
his
chin
in
his
hand
to
observe
the
result
of
his
words
nor
was
he
in
the
least
disappointed
dom
miguel
s
mouth
fell
open
the
colour
slowly
ebbed
from
his
cheeks
leaving
them
an
his
eyes
dilated
and
protruded
he
was
consternation
incarnate
my
god
he
contrived
to
gasp
at
last
and
his
shaking
hands
clutched
at
the
carved
arms
of
his
chair
ye
don
t
seem
as
pleased
as
i
expected
ventured
o
moy
but
general
surely
surely
his
excellency
can
not
mean
to
take
so
so
terrible
a
step
terrible
to
whom
sir
wondered
o
moy
terrible
to
us
forjas
rose
in
his
agitation
he
came
to
lean
upon
o
moy
s
facing
the
adjutant
surely
sir
our
interests
england
s
interests
and
portugal
s
are
one
in
to
be
sure
but
england
s
interests
can
be
defended
elsewhere
than
in
portugal
and
it
is
lord
wellington
s
view
that
they
shall
be
he
has
already
warned
the
council
of
regency
that
since
his
majesty
and
the
prince
regent
have
entrusted
him
with
the
command
of
the
british
and
portuguese
armies
he
will
not
suffer
the
council
or
any
of
its
members
to
interfere
with
his
conduct
of
the
military
operations
or
suffer
any
criticism
or
suggestion
of
theirs
to
alter
system
formed
upon
mature
consideration
but
when
finding
their
criticisms
fail
the
members
of
the
council
in
their
wrongheadedness
in
their
anxiety
to
allow
private
interest
to
triumph
over
public
duty
go
the
length
of
thwarting
the
measures
of
which
they
do
not
approve
the
end
of
lord
wellington
s
patience
has
been
reached
i
am
giving
your
excellency
his
own
words
he
feels
that
it
is
futile
to
remain
in
a
country
whose
government
is
determined
to
undermine
his
every
endeavour
to
bring
this
campaign
to
a
successful
issue
yourself
sir
you
appear
to
be
distressed
but
the
council
of
regency
will
no
doubt
take
a
different
view
it
will
rejoice
in
the
departure
of
a
man
whose
military
operations
it
finds
so
detestable
you
will
no
doubt
discover
this
when
you
come
to
lay
lord
wellington
s
decision
before
the
council
as
i
now
invite
you
to
bewildered
and
undecided
forjas
stood
there
for
a
moment
vainly
seeking
words
finally
is
this
really
lord
wellington
s
last
word
he
asked
in
tones
of
profoundest
consternation
there
is
one
alternative
one
only
said
o
moy
slowly
and
that
instantly
forjas
was
all
eagerness
o
moy
considered
him
faith
i
hesitate
to
state
no
no
please
i
feel
that
it
is
let
the
council
judge
i
implore
you
general
let
the
council
very
o
moy
shrugged
and
took
up
a
sheet
of
the
dispatch
which
lay
before
him
you
will
admit
sir
i
think
that
the
beginning
of
these
troubles
coincided
with
the
advent
of
the
principal
souza
upon
the
council
of
he
waited
in
vain
for
a
reply
forjas
the
diplomat
preserved
an
uncompromising
silence
in
which
presently
o
moy
proceeded
from
this
and
from
other
evidence
of
which
indeed
there
is
no
lack
lord
wellington
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
all
the
resistance
passive
and
active
which
he
has
encountered
results
from
the
principal
souza
s
influence
upon
the
council
you
will
not
i
think
trouble
to
deny
it
forjas
spread
his
hands
you
will
remember
general
he
answered
in
tones
of
conciliatory
regret
that
the
principal
souza
represents
a
class
upon
whom
lord
wellington
s
measures
bear
in
a
manner
peculiarly
you
mean
that
he
represents
the
portuguese
nobility
and
landed
gentry
who
putting
their
own
interests
above
those
of
the
state
have
determined
to
oppose
and
resist
the
devastation
of
the
country
which
lord
wellington
you
put
it
very
bluntly
forjas
admitted
you
will
find
lord
wellington
s
own
words
even
more
blunt
said
o
moy
with
a
grim
smile
and
turned
to
the
dispatch
he
held
let
me
read
you
exactly
what
he
writes
as
for
principal
souza
i
beg
you
to
tell
him
from
me
that
as
i
have
had
no
satisfaction
in
transacting
the
business
of
this
country
since
he
has
become
a
member
of
the
government
no
power
on
earth
shall
induce
me
to
remain
in
the
peninsula
if
he
is
either
to
remain
a
member
of
the
government
or
to
continue
in
lisbon
either
he
must
quit
the
country
or
i
will
do
so
and
this
immediately
after
i
have
obtained
his
majesty
s
permission
to
resign
my
the
adjutant
put
down
the
letter
and
looked
expectantly
at
the
secretary
of
state
who
returned
the
look
with
one
of
utter
dismay
never
in
all
his
career
had
the
diplomat
been
so
completely
dumbfounded
as
he
was
now
by
the
simple
directness
of
the
man
of
action
in
himself
dom
miguel
forjas
was
both
shrewd
and
honest
he
was
shrewd
enough
to
apprehend
to
the
full
the
military
genius
of
the
british
fruits
of
which
he
had
already
witnessed
he
knew
that
the
withdrawal
of
junot
s
army
from
lisbon
two
years
ago
resulted
mainly
from
the
operations
of
sir
arthur
wellesley
as
he
was
then
before
his
supersession
in
the
supreme
command
of
that
first
expedition
and
he
more
than
suspected
that
but
for
that
supersession
the
defeat
of
the
first
french
army
of
invasion
might
have
been
even
more
signal
he
had
witnessed
the
masterly
campaign
of
the
battle
of
the
douro
and
the
relentless
operations
which
had
culminated
in
hurling
the
shattered
fragments
of
soult
s
magnificent
army
over
the
portuguese
frontier
thus
liberating
that
country
for
the
second
time
from
the
thrall
of
the
mighty
french
invader
and
he
knew
that
unless
this
man
and
the
troops
under
his
command
remained
in
portugal
and
enjoyed
complete
liberty
of
action
there
could
be
no
hope
of
stemming
the
third
invasion
for
which
massena
the
ablest
of
all
the
emperor
s
marshals
was
now
gathering
his
divisions
in
the
north
if
wellington
were
to
execute
his
threat
and
withdraw
with
his
army
forjas
beheld
nothing
but
ruin
for
his
country
the
irresistible
french
would
sweep
forward
in
devastating
conquest
and
portuguese
independence
would
be
ground
to
dust
under
the
heel
of
the
terrible
emperor
all
this
the
dom
miguel
forjas
now
perceived
to
do
him
full
justice
he
had
feared
for
some
time
that
the
unreasonable
conduct
of
his
government
might
ultimately
bring
about
some
such
desperate
situation
but
it
was
not
for
him
to
voice
those
fears
he
was
the
servant
of
that
government
the
mere
instrument
and
mouthpiece
of
the
council
of
regency
this
he
said
at
length
in
a
voice
that
was
awed
is
an
it
is
that
o
moy
admitted
readily
forjas
sighed
shook
his
dark
head
and
drew
himself
up
like
a
man
who
has
chosen
his
part
being
shrewd
he
saw
the
immediate
necessity
of
choosing
and
being
honest
he
chose
honestly
perhaps
it
is
as
well
he
said
that
lord
wellington
should
go
cried
o
moy
that
lord
wellington
should
announce
intentions
of
going
forjas
explained
and
having
admitted
so
much
he
now
stripped
off
the
official
mask
completely
he
spoke
with
his
own
voice
and
not
with
that
of
the
council
whose
mouthpiece
he
was
of
course
it
will
never
be
permitted
lord
wellington
has
been
entrusted
with
the
defence
of
the
country
by
the
prince
regent
consequently
it
is
the
duty
of
every
portuguese
to
ensure
that
at
all
costs
he
shall
continue
in
that
o
moy
was
mystified
only
a
knowledge
of
the
minister
s
inmost
thoughts
could
have
explained
this
oddly
sudden
change
of
manner
but
your
excellency
understands
the
terms
the
only
terms
upon
which
his
lordship
will
so
continue
perfectly
i
shall
hasten
to
convey
those
terms
to
the
council
it
is
also
quite
clear
is
it
not
that
i
may
convey
to
my
government
and
indeed
publish
your
complete
assurance
that
the
officer
responsible
for
the
raid
on
the
convent
at
tavora
will
be
shot
when
taken
looking
intently
into
o
moy
s
face
dom
miguel
saw
the
clear
blue
eyes
flicker
under
his
gaze
he
beheld
a
grey
shadow
slowly
overspreading
the
adjutant
s
ruddy
cheek
knowing
nothing
of
the
relationship
between
o
moy
and
the
offender
unable
to
guess
the
sources
of
the
hesitation
of
which
he
now
beheld
such
unmistakable
signs
the
minister
naturally
misunderstood
it
there
must
be
no
flinching
in
this
general
he
cried
let
me
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
quite
frankly
and
in
confidence
not
as
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
council
of
regency
but
as
a
portuguese
patriot
who
places
his
country
and
his
country
s
welfare
above
every
other
consideration
you
have
issued
your
ultimatum
it
may
be
harsh
it
may
be
arbitrary
with
that
i
have
no
concern
the
interests
the
feelings
of
principal
souza
or
of
any
other
individual
however
are
without
weight
when
the
interests
of
the
nation
hang
against
them
in
the
balance
better
that
an
injustice
be
done
to
one
man
than
that
the
whole
country
should
suffer
therefore
i
do
not
argue
with
you
upon
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
lord
wellington
s
ultimatum
that
is
a
matter
apart
lord
wellington
demands
the
removal
of
principal
souza
from
the
government
or
in
the
alternative
proposes
himself
to
withdraw
from
portugal
in
the
national
interest
the
government
can
come
to
only
one
decision
i
am
frank
with
you
general
myself
i
shall
stand
ranged
on
the
side
of
the
national
interest
and
what
my
influence
in
the
council
can
do
it
shall
do
but
if
you
know
principal
souza
at
all
you
must
know
that
he
will
not
relinquish
his
position
without
a
fight
he
has
friends
and
influence
the
patriarch
of
lisbon
and
many
of
the
nobility
will
be
on
his
side
i
warn
you
solemnly
against
leaving
any
weapon
in
his
he
paused
impressively
but
o
moy
now
and
haggard
waited
in
silence
for
him
to
continue
from
the
message
i
brought
you
forjas
resumed
you
will
have
perceived
how
principal
souza
has
fastened
upon
this
business
at
tavora
to
support
his
general
censure
of
lord
wellington
s
conduct
of
the
campaign
that
is
the
weapon
to
which
my
warning
refers
you
must
if
we
who
place
the
national
interest
supreme
are
to
prevail
you
must
disarm
him
by
the
assurance
that
i
ask
for
you
will
perceive
that
i
am
disloyal
to
a
member
of
my
council
so
that
i
may
be
loyal
to
my
country
but
i
repeat
i
speak
to
you
in
confidence
this
officer
has
committed
a
gross
outrage
which
must
bring
the
british
army
into
odium
with
the
people
unless
we
have
your
assurance
that
the
british
army
is
the
first
to
censure
and
to
punish
the
offender
with
the
utmost
rigour
give
me
now
that
i
may
publish
everywhere
your
official
assurance
that
this
man
will
be
shot
and
on
my
side
i
assure
you
that
principal
souza
thus
deprived
of
his
stoutest
weapon
must
succumb
in
the
struggle
that
awaits
i
hope
said
o
moy
slowly
his
head
bowed
his
voice
dull
and
even
unsteady
i
hope
that
i
am
not
behind
you
in
placing
public
duty
above
private
consideration
you
may
publish
my
official
assurance
that
the
officer
in
question
will
be
shot
when
general
i
thank
you
my
country
thanks
you
you
may
be
confident
of
this
he
bowed
gravely
to
o
moy
and
then
to
tremayne
your
excellencies
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
he
was
shown
out
by
the
orderly
who
had
admitted
him
and
he
departed
well
satisfied
in
his
patriotic
heart
that
the
crisis
which
he
had
always
known
to
be
inevitable
should
have
been
reached
at
last
yet
as
he
went
he
wondered
why
the
had
looked
so
downcast
why
his
voice
had
broken
when
he
pledged
his
word
that
justice
should
be
done
upon
the
offending
british
officer
that
however
was
no
concern
of
dom
miguel
s
and
there
was
more
than
enough
to
engage
his
thoughts
when
he
came
to
consider
the
ultimatum
to
his
government
with
which
he
was
charged
chapter
iii
lady
o
moy
across
the
frontier
in
the
northwest
was
gathering
the
third
army
of
invasion
some
sixty
thousand
strong
commanded
by
marshal
massena
prince
of
esslingen
the
most
skilful
and
fortunate
of
all
napoleon
s
generals
a
leader
who
because
he
had
never
known
defeat
had
come
to
be
surnamed
by
his
emperor
the
dear
child
of
wellington
at
the
head
of
a
british
force
of
little
more
than
one
third
of
the
french
host
watched
and
waited
maturing
his
stupendous
strategic
plan
which
those
in
whose
interests
it
had
been
conceived
had
done
so
much
to
thwart
that
plan
was
inspired
by
and
based
upon
the
emperor
s
maxim
that
war
should
support
itself
that
an
army
on
the
march
must
not
be
hampered
and
immobilised
by
its
commissariat
but
that
it
must
draw
its
supplies
from
the
country
it
is
invading
that
it
must
in
short
live
upon
that
country
behind
the
british
army
and
immediately
to
the
north
of
lisbon
in
an
arc
some
thirty
miles
long
following
the
inflection
of
the
hills
from
the
sea
at
the
mouth
of
the
zizandre
to
the
broad
waters
of
the
tagus
at
alhandra
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
were
being
constructed
under
the
direction
of
colonel
fletcher
and
this
so
secretly
and
with
such
careful
measures
as
to
remain
unknown
to
british
and
portuguese
alike
even
those
employed
upon
the
works
knew
of
nothing
save
the
section
upon
which
they
happened
to
be
engaged
and
had
no
conception
of
the
stupendous
and
impregnable
whole
that
was
preparing
to
these
lines
it
was
the
british
commander
s
plan
to
effect
a
slow
retreat
before
the
french
flood
when
it
should
sweep
forward
thus
luring
the
enemy
onward
into
a
country
which
he
had
commanded
should
be
laid
relentlessly
waste
that
there
that
enemy
might
fast
be
starved
and
afterwards
destroyed
to
this
end
had
his
proclamations
gone
forth
commanding
that
all
the
land
lying
between
the
rivers
tagus
and
mondego
in
short
the
whole
of
the
country
between
beira
and
torres
vedras
should
be
stripped
naked
converted
into
a
desert
as
stark
and
empty
as
the
sahara
not
a
head
of
cattle
not
a
grain
of
corn
not
a
skin
of
wine
not
a
flask
of
oil
not
a
crumb
of
anything
affording
nourishment
should
be
left
behind
the
very
mills
were
to
be
rendered
useless
bridges
were
to
be
broken
down
the
houses
emptied
of
all
property
which
the
refugees
were
to
carry
away
with
them
from
the
line
of
invasion
such
was
his
terrible
demand
upon
the
country
for
its
own
salvation
but
such
as
we
have
seen
was
not
war
as
principal
souza
and
some
of
his
adherents
understood
it
they
had
not
the
foresight
to
perceive
the
inevitable
result
of
this
strategic
plan
if
effectively
and
thoroughly
executed
they
did
not
even
realise
that
the
devastation
had
better
be
effected
by
the
british
in
this
defensive
and
in
its
results
at
the
same
time
overwhelmingly
offensive
manner
than
by
the
french
in
the
course
of
a
conquering
onslaught
they
did
not
realise
these
things
partly
because
they
did
not
enjoy
wellington
s
full
confidence
and
in
a
greater
measure
because
they
were
blinded
by
because
as
o
moy
told
forjas
they
placed
private
considerations
above
public
duty
the
northern
nobles
whose
lands
must
suffer
opposed
the
measure
violently
they
even
opposed
the
withdrawal
of
labour
from
those
lands
which
the
militia
act
had
rendered
necessary
and
antonio
de
souza
made
himself
their
champion
until
he
was
broken
by
wellington
s
ultimatum
to
the
council
for
broken
he
was
the
nation
had
come
to
a
parting
of
the
ways
it
had
been
brought
to
the
necessity
of
choosing
and
however
much
the
principal
voicing
the
outcry
of
his
party
might
argue
that
the
british
plan
was
as
detestable
and
ruinous
as
a
french
invasion
the
nation
preferred
to
place
its
confidence
in
the
conqueror
of
vimeiro
and
the
douro
souza
quitted
the
government
and
the
capital
as
had
been
demanded
but
if
wellington
hoped
that
he
would
quit
intriguing
he
misjudged
his
man
he
was
a
fellow
of
monstrous
vanity
pride
and
of
the
sort
than
which
there
is
none
more
dangerous
to
offend
his
wounded
pride
demanded
a
salve
to
be
procured
at
any
cost
the
wound
had
been
administered
by
wellington
and
must
be
returned
with
interest
so
that
he
ruined
wellington
it
mattered
nothing
to
antonio
de
souza
that
he
should
ruin
himself
and
his
own
country
at
the
same
time
he
was
like
some
blinded
ferocious
and
unreasoning
beast
ready
even
eager
to
sacrifice
its
own
life
so
that
in
dying
it
can
destroy
its
enemy
and
slake
its
in
that
mood
he
passes
out
of
the
councils
of
the
portuguese
government
into
a
brooding
and
secretly
active
retirement
of
which
the
fruits
shall
presently
be
shown
with
his
departure
the
council
of
regency
rudely
shaken
by
the
ultimatum
which
had
driven
him
forth
became
more
docile
and
active
and
for
a
season
the
measures
enjoined
by
the
were
pursued
with
some
show
of
earnestness
as
a
result
of
all
this
life
at
monsanto
became
easier
and
o
moy
was
able
to
breathe
more
freely
and
to
devote
more
of
his
time
to
matters
concerning
the
fortifications
which
wellington
had
left
largely
in
his
charge
then
too
as
the
weeks
passed
the
shadow
overhanging
him
with
regard
to
richard
butler
gradually
lifted
no
further
word
had
there
been
of
the
missing
lieutenant
and
by
the
end
of
may
both
o
moy
and
tremayne
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
some
of
the
ferocious
mountaineers
to
whom
a
soldier
whether
his
uniform
were
british
or
french
was
a
thing
to
be
done
to
death
for
his
wife
s
sake
o
moy
came
thankfully
to
that
conclusion
under
the
circumstances
it
was
the
best
possible
termination
to
the
episode
she
must
be
told
of
her
brother
s
death
presently
when
evidence
of
it
was
forthcoming
she
would
mourn
him
passionately
no
doubt
for
her
attachment
to
him
was
deep
extraordinarily
deep
for
so
shallow
a
woman
but
at
least
she
would
be
spared
the
pain
and
shame
she
must
inevitably
have
felt
had
he
been
taken
and
shot
meanwhile
however
the
lack
of
news
from
him
in
another
sense
would
have
to
be
explained
to
una
sooner
or
later
for
a
fitful
correspondence
was
maintained
between
brother
and
sister
and
o
moy
dreaded
the
moment
when
this
explanation
must
be
made
lacking
invention
he
applied
to
tremayne
for
assistance
and
tremayne
glumly
supplied
him
with
the
necessary
lie
that
should
meet
lady
o
moy
s
inquiries
when
they
came
in
the
end
however
he
was
spared
the
necessity
of
falsehood
for
the
truth
itself
reached
lady
o
moy
in
an
unexpected
manner
it
came
about
a
month
after
that
day
when
o
moy
had
first
received
news
of
the
escapade
at
tavora
it
was
a
resplendent
morning
of
early
june
and
the
adjutant
was
detained
a
few
moments
from
breakfast
by
the
arrival
of
a
from
headquarters
now
established
at
vizeu
leaving
captain
tremayne
to
deal
with
it
sir
terence
went
down
to
breakfast
bearing
with
him
only
a
few
letters
of
a
personal
character
which
had
reached
him
from
friends
on
the
frontier
the
architecture
of
the
house
at
monsanto
was
of
a
semiclaustral
character
three
sides
of
it
enclosed
a
sheltered
luxuriant
garden
whilst
on
the
fourth
side
a
connecting
corridor
completing
the
quadrangle
spanned
bridgewise
the
spacious
archway
through
which
admittance
was
gained
directly
from
the
parklands
that
sloped
gently
to
alcantara
this
archway
closed
at
night
by
enormous
wooden
doors
opened
wide
during
the
day
upon
a
grassy
terrace
bounded
by
a
baluster
of
white
marble
that
gleamed
now
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
it
was
o
moy
s
practice
to
breakfast
in
that
genial
climate
and
during
april
before
the
sun
had
reached
its
present
intensity
the
table
had
been
spread
out
there
upon
the
terrace
now
however
it
was
wiser
even
in
the
early
morning
to
seek
the
shade
and
breakfast
was
served
within
the
quadrangle
under
a
trellis
of
vine
supported
in
the
portuguese
manner
by
granite
columns
it
was
a
delicious
spot
cool
and
fragrant
secluded
without
being
enclosed
since
through
the
broad
archway
it
commanded
a
view
of
the
tagus
and
the
hills
of
alemtejo
here
o
moy
found
himself
impatiently
awaited
that
morning
by
his
wife
and
her
cousin
sylvia
armytage
more
recently
arrived
from
england
you
are
very
late
lady
o
moy
greeted
him
petulantly
since
she
spent
her
life
in
keeping
other
people
waiting
it
naturally
fretted
her
to
discover
unpunctuality
in
others
her
portrait
by
raeburn
which
now
adorns
the
national
gallery
had
been
painted
in
the
previous
year
you
will
have
seen
it
or
at
least
you
will
have
seen
one
of
its
numerous
replicas
and
you
will
have
remarked
its
singular
delicate
loveliness
the
gleaming
golden
head
the
flawless
outline
of
face
and
feature
the
immaculate
skin
the
dark
blue
eyes
with
their
look
of
innocence
awakening
thus
was
she
now
in
her
artfully
simple
gown
of
flowered
muslin
with
its
white
fichu
folded
across
her
neck
that
was
but
a
shade
less
white
thus
was
she
just
as
raeburn
had
painted
her
saving
of
course
that
her
expression
matching
her
words
was
petulant
i
was
detained
by
the
arrival
of
a
from
vizeu
sir
terence
excused
himself
as
he
took
the
chair
which
mullins
the
elderly
pontifical
butler
drew
out
for
him
ned
is
attending
to
it
and
will
be
kept
for
a
few
moments
lady
o
moy
s
expression
quickened
are
there
no
letters
for
me
none
my
dear
i
no
word
from
dick
again
there
was
that
note
of
ever
ready
petulance
it
is
too
provoking
he
should
know
that
he
must
make
me
anxious
by
his
silence
dick
is
so
thoughtless
so
careless
of
other
people
s
feelings
i
shall
write
to
him
the
adjutant
paused
in
the
act
of
unfolding
his
napkin
the
prepared
explanation
trembled
on
his
lips
but
its
falsehood
repellent
to
him
was
not
uttered
i
should
certainly
do
so
my
dear
was
all
he
said
and
addressed
himself
to
his
breakfast
what
news
from
headquarters
miss
armytage
asked
him
are
things
going
well
much
better
now
that
principal
souza
s
influence
is
at
an
end
cotton
reports
that
the
destruction
of
the
mills
in
the
mondego
valley
is
being
carried
out
miss
armytage
s
dark
thoughtful
eyes
became
wistful
do
you
know
terence
she
said
that
i
am
not
without
some
sympathy
for
the
portuguese
resistance
to
lord
wellington
s
decrees
they
must
bear
so
terribly
hard
upon
the
people
to
be
compelled
with
their
own
hands
to
destroy
their
homes
and
lay
waste
the
lands
upon
which
they
have
laboured
what
could
be
more
cruel
war
can
never
be
anything
but
cruel
he
answered
gravely
god
help
the
people
over
whose
lands
it
sweeps
devastation
is
often
the
least
of
the
horrors
marching
in
its
why
must
war
be
she
asked
him
in
intelligent
rebellion
against
that
most
monstrous
and
infamous
of
all
human
madnesses
o
moy
proceeded
to
do
his
best
to
explain
the
unexplainable
and
since
himself
a
professional
soldier
he
could
not
take
the
sane
view
of
his
sane
young
questioner
hot
argument
ensued
between
them
to
the
infinite
weariness
of
lady
o
moy
who
out
of
gave
herself
to
the
study
of
the
latest
fashion
plates
from
london
and
the
consideration
of
a
gown
for
the
ball
which
the
count
of
redondo
was
giving
in
the
following
week
it
was
thus
in
all
things
for
these
cousins
represented
the
two
poles
of
womanhood
miss
armytage
without
any
of
lady
o
moy
s
insistent
and
excessive
femininity
was
nevertheless
feminine
to
the
core
but
hers
was
the
diana
type
of
womanliness
she
was
tall
and
of
a
supple
grace
now
emphasised
by
the
which
she
was
wearing
for
she
had
been
in
the
saddle
during
the
hour
which
lady
o
moy
had
consecrated
to
the
rites
of
toilet
and
devotions
done
before
her
mirror
vivacity
and
intelligence
lent
her
countenance
an
attraction
very
different
from
the
allurement
of
her
cousin
s
delicate
loveliness
and
because
her
countenance
was
a
true
mirror
of
her
mind
she
argued
shrewdly
now
so
shrewdly
that
she
drove
o
moy
to
entrench
himself
behind
generalisations
my
dear
sylvia
war
is
most
merciful
where
it
is
most
merciless
he
assured
her
with
the
irish
gift
for
paradox
at
home
in
the
government
itself
there
are
plenty
who
argue
as
you
argue
and
who
are
wondering
when
we
shall
embark
for
england
that
is
because
they
are
intellectuals
and
war
is
a
thing
beyond
the
understanding
of
intellectuals
it
is
not
intellect
but
brute
instinct
and
brute
force
that
will
help
humanity
in
such
a
crisis
as
the
present
therefore
let
me
tell
you
my
child
that
a
government
of
intellectual
men
is
the
worst
possible
government
for
a
nation
engaged
in
a
this
was
far
from
satisfying
miss
armytage
lord
wellington
himself
was
an
intellectual
she
objected
nobody
could
deny
it
there
was
the
work
he
had
done
as
irish
secretary
and
there
was
the
calculating
genius
he
had
displayed
at
vimeiro
at
oporto
at
talavera
and
then
observing
her
husband
to
be
in
distress
lady
o
moy
put
down
her
fashion
plate
and
brought
up
her
heavy
artillery
to
relieve
him
sylvia
dear
she
interpolated
i
wonder
that
you
will
for
ever
be
arguing
about
things
you
don
t
miss
armytage
laughed
she
was
not
easily
put
out
of
countenance
what
woman
doesn
t
she
asked
i
don
t
and
i
am
a
woman
ah
but
an
exceptional
woman
her
cousin
rallied
her
affectionately
tapping
the
shapely
white
arm
that
protruded
from
a
foam
of
lace
and
lady
o
moy
to
whom
words
never
had
any
but
a
literal
meaning
set
herself
to
purr
precisely
as
one
would
have
expected
complacently
she
discoursed
upon
the
perfection
of
her
own
endowments
appealing
ever
and
anon
to
her
husband
for
confirmation
and
o
moy
who
loved
her
with
all
the
passionate
reverence
which
nature
working
inscrutably
to
her
ends
so
often
inspires
in
just
such
strong
essentially
masculine
men
for
just
such
fragile
and
excessively
feminine
women
afforded
this
confirmation
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
sincere
conviction
thus
until
mullins
broke
in
upon
them
with
the
announcement
of
a
visit
from
count
samoval
an
announcement
more
welcome
to
lady
o
moy
than
to
either
of
her
companions
the
portuguese
nobleman
was
introduced
he
had
attained
to
a
degree
of
familiarity
in
the
adjutant
s
household
that
permitted
of
his
being
received
without
ceremony
there
at
that
spread
in
the
open
he
was
a
slender
handsome
swarthy
man
of
thirty
scrupulously
dressed
as
graceful
and
elegant
in
his
movements
as
a
fencing
master
which
indeed
he
might
have
been
for
his
skill
with
the
foils
was
a
matter
of
pride
to
himself
and
notoriety
to
all
the
world
nor
was
it
by
any
means
the
only
skill
he
might
have
boasted
for
jeronymo
de
samoval
was
in
many
things
a
very
subtle
supple
gentleman
his
friendship
with
the
o
moys
now
some
three
months
old
had
been
considerably
strengthened
of
late
by
the
fact
that
he
had
unexpectedly
become
one
of
the
most
hostile
critics
of
the
council
of
regency
as
lately
constituted
and
one
of
the
most
ardent
supporters
of
the
wellingtonian
policy
he
bowed
with
supremest
grace
to
the
ladies
ventured
to
kiss
the
fair
smooth
hand
of
his
hostess
undeterred
by
the
frosty
stare
of
o
moy
s
blue
eyes
whose
approval
of
all
men
was
in
inverse
proportion
to
their
approval
of
his
wife
and
finally
proffered
her
the
armful
of
early
roses
that
he
brought
these
poor
roses
of
portugal
to
their
sister
from
england
said
his
softly
caressing
tenor
voice
ye
re
a
poet
said
o
moy
tartly
having
found
castalia
here
said
the
count
shall
i
not
drink
its
limpid
waters
not
i
hope
while
there
s
an
agreeable
vintage
of
port
on
the
table
a
morning
whet
samoval
o
moy
invited
him
taking
up
the
decanter
two
fingers
then
no
more
it
is
not
my
custom
in
the
morning
but
here
to
drink
your
lady
s
health
and
yours
miss
with
a
graceful
flourish
of
his
glass
he
pledged
them
both
and
sipped
delicately
then
took
the
chair
that
o
moy
was
proffering
good
news
i
hear
general
antonio
de
souza
s
removal
from
the
government
is
already
bearing
fruit
the
mills
in
the
valley
of
the
mondego

being
effectively
destroyed

well
informed
grunted
o
moy
who
himself
had
but
received
the
news
as
well
informed
indeed
as
i
am
there
was
a
note
almost
of
suspicion
in
the
words
and
he
was
vexed
that
matters
which
it
was
desirable
be
kept
screened
as
much
as
possible
from
general
knowledge
should
so
soon
be
put
abroad
naturally
and
with
reason
was
the
answer
delivered
with
a
rueful
smile

sighed
but
i
bow
to
the
necessities
of
war
at
least
it
can
not
be
said
of
me
as
was
said
of
those
whose
interests
souza
represented
that
i
put
private
considerations
above
public
duty
that
is
the
phrase
i
think
the
individual
must
suffer
that
the
nation
may
triumph
a
roman
maxim
my
dear
and
a
british
one
said
o
moy
to
whom
britain
was
a
second
rome
oh
admitted
replied
the
amiable
samoval
you
proved
it
by
your
uncompromising
firmness
in
the
affair
of
what
was
that
inquired
miss
armytage
have
you
not
heard
cried
samoval
in
astonishment
of
course
not
snapped
o
moy
who
had
broken
into
a
cold
perspiration
hardly
a
subject
for
the
ladies
rebuked
for
his
intention
samoval
submitted
instantly
perhaps
not
perhaps
not
he
agreed
as
if
dismissing
it
whereupon
o
moy
recovered
from
his
momentary
breathlessness
but
in
your
own
interests
my
dear
general
i
trust
there
will
be
no
weakening
when
this
lieutenant
butler
is
caught
and
who
sharp
and
stridently
came
that
single
word
from
her
ladyship
desperately
o
moy
sought
to
defend
the
breach
nothing
to
do
with
dick
my
dear
a
fellow
named
philip
butler
who
but
the
samoval
corrected
him
not
philip
general
richard
butler
i
had
the
name
but
yesterday
from
in
the
scared
hush
that
followed
the
count
perceived
that
he
had
stumbled
headlong
into
a
mystery
he
saw
lady
o
moy
s
face
turn
whiter
and
whiter
saw
her
sapphire
eyes
dilating
as
they
regarded
him
richard
butler
she
echoed
what
of
richard
butler
tell
me
tell
me
at
hesitating
before
such
signs
of
distress
samoval
looked
at
o
moy
to
meet
a
dejected
scowl
lady
o
moy
turned
to
her
husband
what
is
it
she
demanded
you
know
something
about
dick
and
you
are
keeping
it
from
me
dick
is
in
trouble
he
is
o
moy
admitted
in
great
what
has
he
done
you
spoke
of
an
affair
at
evora
or
tavora
which
is
not
to
be
mentioned
before
ladies
i
demand
to
her
affection
and
anxiety
for
her
brother
invested
her
for
a
moment
with
a
certain
dignity
lent
her
a
force
that
was
but
rarely
displayed
by
her
seeing
the
men
stricken
speechless
samoval
from
bewildered
astonishment
o
moy
from
distress
she
jumped
to
the
conclusion
after
what
had
been
said
that
motives
of
modesty
accounted
for
their
silence
leave
us
sylvia
please
she
said
forgive
me
dear
but
you
see
they
will
not
mention
these
things
while
you
are
she
made
a
piteous
little
figure
as
she
stood
trembling
there
her
fingers
tearing
in
agitation
at
one
of
samoval
s
roses
she
waited
until
the
obedient
and
discreet
miss
armytage
had
passed
from
view
into
the
wing
that
contained
the
adjutant
s
private
quarters
then
sinking
limp
and
nerveless
to
her
chair
now
she
bade
them
please
tell
and
o
moy
with
a
sigh
of
regret
for
the
lie
so
laboriously
concocted
which
would
never
now
be
uttered
delivered
himself
huskily
of
the
hideous
truth
chapter
iv
count
samoval
miss
armytage
s
own
notions
of
what
might
be
fit
and
proper
for
her
virginal
ears
were
by
no
means
coincident
with
lady
o
moy
s
thus
although
you
have
seen
her
pass
into
the
private
quarters
of
the
adjutant
s
establishment
and
although
in
fact
she
did
withdraw
to
her
own
room
she
found
it
impossible
to
abide
there
a
prey
to
doubt
and
misgivings
as
to
what
dick
butler
might
have
done
doubt
and
misgivings
be
it
understood
entertained
purely
on
una
s
account
and
not
at
all
on
dick
s
by
the
corridor
spanning
the
archway
on
the
southern
side
of
the
quadrangle
and
serving
as
a
connecting
bridge
between
the
adjutant
s
private
and
official
quarters
miss
armytage
took
her
way
to
sir
terence
s
knowing
that
she
would
find
captain
tremayne
there
and
assuming
that
he
would
be
alone
may
i
come
in
she
asked
him
from
the
doorway
he
sprang
to
his
feet
why
certainly
miss
for
so
imperturbable
a
young
man
he
seemed
oddly
breathless
in
his
eagerness
to
welcome
her
are
you
looking
for
o
moy
he
left
me
nearly
ago
to
go
to
breakfast
and
i
was
just
about
to
i
scarcely
dare
detain
you
on
the
contrary
i
mean
not
at
all
but
were
you
wanting
me
she
closed
the
door
and
came
forward
into
the
room
moving
with
that
supple
grace
peculiarly
her
own
i
want
you
to
tell
me
something
captain
tremayne
and
i
want
you
to
be
frank
with
i
hope
i
could
never
be
anything
i
want
you
to
treat
me
as
you
would
treat
a
man
a
friend
of
your
own
tremayne
sighed
he
had
recovered
from
the
surprise
of
her
coming
and
was
again
his
imperturbable
self
i
assure
you
that
is
the
last
way
in
which
i
desire
to
treat
you
but
if
you
insist
i
she
had
frowned
slightly
at
the
earlier
part
of
his
speech
with
its
subtle
gallantry
and
she
spoke
sharply
now
i
bow
to
your
will
said
captain
tremayne
what
has
dick
butler
been
doing
he
looked
into
her
face
with
sharply
questioning
eyes
what
was
it
that
happened
at
tavora
he
continued
to
look
at
her
what
have
you
heard
he
asked
at
last
only
that
he
has
done
something
at
tavora
for
which
the
consequences
i
gather
may
be
grave
i
am
anxious
for
una
s
sake
to
know
what
it
does
una
know
she
is
being
told
now
count
samoval
let
slip
just
what
i
have
outlined
and
she
has
insisted
upon
being
told
then
why
did
you
not
remain
to
hear
because
they
sent
me
away
on
the
plea
that
oh
on
the
silly
plea
of
my
youth
and
innocence
which
were
not
to
be
but
which
you
expect
me
to
offend
no
because
i
can
trust
you
to
tell
me
without
sylvia
it
was
a
curious
exclamation
of
satisfaction
and
of
gratitude
for
the
implied
confidence
we
must
admit
that
it
betrayed
a
selfish
forgetfulness
of
dick
butler
and
his
troubles
but
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
it
was
upon
such
grounds
that
it
offended
her
she
stiffened
perceptibly
really
captain
tremayne
i
beg
your
pardon
said
he
but
you
seemed
to
imply
he
checked
at
a
loss
her
colour
rose
well
sir
what
do
you
suggest
that
i
implied
or
seemed
to
imply
but
as
suddenly
her
manner
changed
i
think
we
are
too
concerned
with
trifles
where
the
matter
on
which
i
have
sought
you
is
a
serious
it
is
of
the
utmost
seriousness
he
admitted
gravely
won
t
you
tell
me
what
it
is
he
told
her
quite
simply
the
whole
story
not
forgetting
to
give
prominence
to
the
circumstances
extenuating
it
in
butler
s
favour
she
listened
with
a
deepening
frown
rather
pale
her
head
bowed
and
when
he
is
taken
she
asked
what
what
will
happen
to
him
let
us
hope
that
he
will
not
be
but
if
he
is
if
he
is
she
insisted
almost
impatiently
captain
tremayne
turned
aside
and
looked
out
of
the
window
i
should
welcome
the
news
that
he
is
dead
he
said
softly
for
if
he
is
taken
he
will
find
no
mercy
at
the
hands
of
his
own
you
mean
that
he
will
be
shot
horror
charged
her
voice
dilated
her
eyes
a
shudder
ran
through
her
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
when
she
withdrew
then
tremayne
beheld
the
lovely
countenance
transformed
it
was
white
and
drawn
but
surely
terence
can
save
him
she
cried
piteously
he
shook
his
head
his
lips
tight
pressed
there
is
no
man
less
able
to
do
what
do
you
mean
why
do
you
say
that
he
looked
at
her
hesitating
for
a
moment
then
answered
her
o
moy
has
pledged
his
word
to
the
portuguese
government
that
dick
butler
shall
be
shot
when
terence
did
that
he
was
compelled
to
it
honour
and
duty
demanded
no
less
of
him
i
alone
who
was
present
and
witnessed
the
undertaking
know
what
it
cost
him
and
what
he
suffered
but
he
was
forced
to
sink
all
private
considerations
it
was
a
sacrifice
rendered
necessary
inevitable
for
the
success
of
this
and
he
proceeded
to
explain
to
her
all
the
circumstances
that
were
interwoven
with
lieutenant
butler
s
offence
thus
you
see
that
from
terence
you
can
hope
for
nothing
his
honour
will
not
admit
of
his
wavering
in
this
honour
she
uttered
the
word
almost
with
contempt
and
what
of
una
i
was
thinking
of
una
when
i
said
i
should
welcome
the
news
of
dick
s
death
somewhere
in
the
hills
it
is
the
best
that
can
be
hoped
i
thought
you
were
dick
s
friend
captain
why
so
i
have
been
so
i
am
perhaps
that
is
another
reason
why
i
should
hope
that
he
is
is
it
no
reason
why
you
should
do
what
you
can
to
save
him
he
looked
at
her
steadily
for
an
instant
calm
under
the
reproach
of
her
eyes
believe
me
miss
armytage
if
i
saw
a
way
to
save
him
to
do
anything
to
help
him
i
should
seize
it
both
for
the
sake
of
my
friendship
for
himself
and
because
of
my
affection
for
una
since
you
yourself
are
interested
in
him
that
is
an
added
reason
for
me
but
it
is
one
thing
to
admit
willingness
to
help
and
another
thing
actually
to
afford
help
what
is
there
that
i
can
do
i
assure
you
that
i
have
thought
of
the
matter
indeed
for
days
i
have
thought
of
little
else
but
i
can
see
no
light
i
await
events
perhaps
a
chance
may
her
expression
had
softened
i
she
put
out
a
hand
generously
to
ask
forgiveness
i
was
presumptuous
and
i
had
no
right
to
speak
as
i
he
took
the
hand
i
should
never
question
your
right
to
speak
to
me
in
any
way
that
seemed
good
to
you
he
assured
her
i
had
better
go
to
una
she
will
be
needing
me
poor
child
i
am
grateful
to
you
captain
tremayne
for
your
confidence
and
for
telling
and
thus
she
left
him
very
thoughtful
as
concerned
for
una
as
she
was
herself
now
una
o
moy
was
the
natural
product
of
such
treatment
there
had
ever
been
something
so
appealing
in
her
lovely
helplessness
and
fragility
that
all
her
life
others
had
been
concerned
to
shelter
her
from
every
wind
that
blew
because
it
was
so
she
was
what
she
was
and
because
she
was
what
she
was
it
would
continue
to
be
so
but
lady
o
moy
at
the
moment
did
not
stand
in
such
urgent
need
of
miss
armytage
as
miss
armytage
imagined
she
had
heard
the
appalling
story
of
her
brother
s
escapade
but
she
had
been
unable
to
perceive
in
what
it
was
so
terrible
as
it
was
declared
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
had
invaded
the
convent
under
a
misapprehension
for
which
it
was
ridiculous
to
blame
him
it
was
a
mistake
which
any
man
might
have
made
in
a
foreign
country
lives
had
been
lost
it
is
true
but
that
was
owing
to
the
stupidity
of
other
people
of
the
nuns
who
had
run
for
shelter
when
no
danger
threatened
save
in
their
own
silly
imaginations
and
of
the
peasants
who
had
come
blundering
to
their
assistance
where
no
assistance
was
required
the
latter
were
the
people
responsible
for
the
bloodshed
since
they
had
attacked
the
dragoons
could
it
be
expected
of
the
dragoons
that
they
should
tamely
suffer
themselves
to
be
massacred
thus
lady
o
moy
upon
the
affair
of
tavora
the
whole
thing
appeared
to
her
to
be
rather
silly
and
she
refused
seriously
to
consider
that
it
could
have
any
grave
consequences
for
dick
his
continued
absence
made
her
anxious
but
if
he
should
come
to
be
taken
surely
his
punishment
would
be
merely
a
formal
matter
at
the
worst
he
might
be
sent
home
which
would
be
a
very
good
thing
for
after
all
the
climate
of
the
peninsula
had
never
quite
suited
him
in
this
fashion
she
nimbly
pursued
a
train
of
vitiated
logic
passing
from
inconsequence
to
inconsequence
and
o
moy
thankful
that
she
should
take
such
a
view
as
this
mercifully
hopeful
that
the
last
had
been
heard
of
his
peccant
and
vexatious
content
more
than
content
to
leave
her
comforted
such
illusions
and
then
while
she
was
still
discussing
the
matter
in
terms
of
comparative
calm
came
an
orderly
to
summon
him
away
so
that
he
left
her
in
the
company
of
samoval
the
count
had
been
deeply
shocked
by
the
discovery
that
dick
butler
was
lady
o
moy
s
brother
and
a
little
confused
that
he
himself
in
his
ignorance
should
have
been
the
means
of
bringing
to
her
knowledge
a
painful
matter
that
touched
her
so
closely
and
that
hitherto
had
been
so
carefully
concealed
from
her
by
her
husband
he
was
thankful
that
she
should
take
so
optimistic
a
view
and
quick
to
perceive
o
moy
s
charitable
desire
to
leave
her
optimism
undispelled
but
he
was
no
less
quick
to
perceive
the
opportunities
which
the
circumstances
afforded
him
to
further
a
certain
deep
intrigue
upon
which
he
was
engaged
therefore
he
did
not
take
his
leave
just
yet
he
sauntered
with
lady
o
moy
on
the
terrace
above
the
wooded
slopes
that
screened
the
village
of
alcantara
and
there
discovered
her
mind
to
be
even
more
frivolous
and
unstable
than
his
perspicuity
had
hitherto
suspected
under
stress
lady
o
moy
could
convey
the
sense
that
she
felt
deeply
she
could
be
almost
theatrical
in
her
displays
of
emotion
but
these
were
as
transient
as
they
were
intense
nothing
that
was
not
immediately
present
to
her
senses
was
ever
capable
of
a
deep
impression
upon
her
spirit
and
she
had
the
facility
characteristic
of
the
and
of
putting
aside
any
matter
that
was
unpleasant
thus
easily
as
we
have
seen
that
this
escapade
of
richard
s
was
not
to
be
regarded
too
seriously
and
that
its
consequences
were
not
likely
to
be
grave
she
chattered
with
gay
inconsequence
of
other
things
of
the
last
week
at
the
house
of
the
marquis
of
minas
that
prominent
member
of
the
council
of
regency
of
the
forthcoming
ball
to
be
given
by
the
count
of
redondo
of
the
latest
news
from
home
the
latest
fashion
and
the
latest
scandal
the
amours
of
the
duke
of
york
and
the
shortcomings
of
perceval
samoval
however
did
not
intend
that
the
matter
of
her
brother
should
be
so
entirely
forgotten
so
lightly
treated
deliberately
at
last
he
revived
it
considering
her
as
she
leant
upon
the
granite
balustrade
her
pink
sunshade
aslant
over
her
shoulder
her
flimsy
lace
shawl
festooned
from
the
crook
of
either
arm
and
floating
behind
her
a
wisp
of
cloudy
vapour
samoval
permitted
himself
a
sigh
she
flashed
him
a
sidelong
glance
arch
and
rallying
you
are
melancholy
sir
a
poor
compliment
she
told
him
but
do
not
misunderstand
her
hers
was
an
almost
childish
coquetry
inevitable
fruit
of
her
intense
femininity
craving
ever
the
worship
of
the
sterner
sex
and
the
incense
of
its
flattery
and
samoval
after
all
young
noble
handsome
with
a
reputation
was
something
of
a
figure
of
romance
as
a
good
many
women
had
discovered
to
their
cost
he
fingered
his
snowy
stock
and
bent
upon
her
eyes
of
glowing
adoration
dear
lady
o
moy
his
tenor
voice
was
soft
and
soothing
as
a
caress
i
sigh
to
think
that
one
so
adorable
so
entirely
made
for
life
s
sunshine
and
gladness
should
have
cause
for
a
moment
s
uneasiness
perhaps
for
secret
grief
at
the
thought
of
the
peril
of
her
her
glance
clouded
under
this
reminder
then
she
pouted
and
made
a
little
gesture
of
impatience
dick
is
not
in
peril
she
answered
he
is
foolish
to
remain
so
long
in
hiding
and
of
course
he
will
have
to
face
unpleasantness
when
he
is
found
but
to
say
that
he
is
in
peril
is
just
nonsense
terence
said
nothing
of
peril
he
agreed
with
me
that
dick
will
probably
be
sent
home
surely
you
don
t
think
no
he
looked
down
studying
his
hessians
for
a
moment
then
his
dark
eyes
returned
to
meet
her
own
i
shall
see
to
it
that
he
is
in
no
danger
you
may
depend
upon
me
who
ask
but
the
happy
chance
to
serve
you
should
there
be
any
trouble
let
me
know
at
once
and
i
will
see
to
it
that
all
is
well
your
brother
must
not
suffer
since
he
is
your
brother
he
is
very
blessed
and
enviable
in
she
stared
at
him
her
brows
knitting
but
i
don
t
is
it
not
plain
whatever
happens
you
must
not
suffer
lady
o
moy
no
man
of
feeling
and
i
least
of
any
could
endure
it
and
since
if
your
brother
were
to
suffer
that
must
bring
suffering
to
you
you
may
count
upon
me
to
shield
you
are
very
good
count
but
shield
him
from
what
from
whatever
may
threaten
the
portuguese
government
may
demand
in
to
appease
the
clamour
of
the
people
stupidly
outraged
by
this
affair
that
an
example
shall
be
made
of
the
oh
but
how
could
they
with
what
reason
she
displayed
a
vague
alarm
and
a
less
vague
impatience
of
such
hypotheses
he
shrugged
the
people
are
like
that
a
fierce
vengeful
god
to
whom
appeasing
sacrifices
must
be
offered
from
time
to
time
if
the
people
demand
a
scapegoat
governments
usually
provide
one
but
be
in
his
eagerness
of
reassurance
he
caught
her
delicate
mittened
hand
in
his
own
and
her
anxiety
rendering
her
heedless
she
allowed
it
to
lie
there
gently
imprisoned
be
comforted
i
shall
be
here
to
guard
him
there
is
much
that
i
can
do
and
you
may
depend
upon
me
to
do
it
for
your
sake
dear
lady
the
government
will
listen
to
me
i
would
not
have
you
imagine
me
capable
of
boasting
i
have
influence
with
the
government
that
is
all
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
so
far
as
the
portuguese
government
is
concerned
your
brother
shall
take
no
she
looked
at
him
for
a
long
moment
with
moist
eyes
moved
and
flattered
by
his
earnestness
and
intensity
of
homage
i
take
this
very
kindly
in
you
sir
i
have
no
thanks
that
are
worthy
she
said
her
voice
trembling
a
little
i
have
no
means
of
repaying
you
you
have
made
me
very
happy
he
bent
low
over
the
frail
hand
he
was
holding
your
assurance
that
i
have
made
you
happy
repays
me
very
fully
since
your
happiness
is
my
tenderest
concern
believe
me
dear
lady
you
may
ever
count
jeronymo
de
samoval
your
most
devoted
and
obedient
he
bore
the
hand
to
his
lips
and
held
it
to
them
for
a
long
moment
whilst
with
heightened
colour
and
eyes
that
sparkled
more
be
it
confessed
from
excitement
than
from
gratitude
she
stood
passively
considering
his
bowed
dark
head
as
he
came
erect
again
a
movement
under
the
archway
caught
his
eye
and
turning
he
found
himself
confronting
sir
terence
and
miss
armytage
who
were
approaching
if
it
vexed
him
to
have
been
caught
by
a
husband
notoriously
jealous
in
an
attitude
not
altogether
uncompromising
samoval
betrayed
no
sign
of
it
with
smooth
he
hailed
o
moy
general
you
come
in
time
to
enable
me
to
take
my
leave
of
you
i
was
on
the
point
of
so
i
perceived
said
o
moy
tartly
he
had
almost
said
so
i
had
his
frosty
manner
would
have
imposed
constraint
upon
any
man
less
master
of
himself
than
samoval
but
the
count
ignored
it
and
ignoring
it
delayed
a
moment
to
exchange
amiabilities
politely
with
miss
armytage
before
taking
at
last
an
unhurried
and
unperturbed
departure
but
no
sooner
was
he
gone
than
o
moy
expressed
himself
full
frankly
to
his
wife
i
think
samoval
is
becoming
too
attentive
and
too
he
is
a
dear
said
lady
o
moy
that
is
what
i
mean
replied
sir
terence
grimly
he
has
undertaken
that
if
there
should
be
any
trouble
with
the
portuguese
government
about
dick
s
silly
affair
he
will
put
it
oh
said
o
moy
that
was
it
and
out
of
his
tender
consideration
for
her
said
no
more
but
sylvia
armytage
knowing
what
she
knew
from
captain
tremayne
was
not
content
to
leave
the
matter
there
she
reverted
to
it
presently
as
she
was
going
indoors
alone
with
her
cousin
una
she
said
gently
i
should
not
place
too
much
faith
in
count
samoval
and
his
what
do
you
mean
lady
o
moy
was
never
very
tolerant
of
advice
especially
from
an
inexperienced
young
girl
i
do
not
altogether
trust
him
nor
does
pooh
terence
mistrusts
every
man
who
looks
at
me
my
dear
never
marry
a
jealous
man
she
added
with
her
inevitable
inconsequence
he
is
the
last
man
the
count
i
mean
to
whom
in
your
place
i
should
go
for
assistance
if
there
is
trouble
about
she
was
thinking
of
what
tremayne
had
told
her
of
the
attitude
of
the
portuguese
government
and
her
mind
perceived
an
obvious
peril
in
permitting
count
samoval
to
become
aware
of
dick
s
whereabouts
should
they
ever
be
discovered
what
nonsense
sylvia
you
conceive
the
oddest
and
most
foolish
notions
sometimes
but
of
course
you
have
no
experience
of
the
and
beyond
that
she
refused
to
discuss
the
matter
nor
did
the
wise
sylvia
insist
chapter
the
fugitive
although
dick
butler
might
continue
missing
in
the
flesh
in
the
spirit
he
and
his
miserable
affair
seem
to
have
been
ever
present
and
ubiquitous
and
a
most
fruitful
source
of
trouble
it
would
be
at
about
this
time
that
there
befell
in
lisbon
the
deplorable
event
that
nipped
in
the
bud
the
career
of
that
most
promising
young
officer
major
berkeley
of
the
famous
the
foot
coming
into
lisbon
on
leave
from
his
regiment
which
was
stationed
at
abrantes
and
formed
part
of
the
division
under
sir
rowland
hill
the
major
happened
into
a
company
that
contained
at
least
one
member
who
was
hostile
to
lord
wellington
s
conduct
of
the
campaign
or
rather
to
the
measures
which
it
entailed
as
in
the
case
of
the
principal
souza
prejudice
drove
him
to
take
up
any
weapon
that
came
to
his
hand
by
means
of
which
he
could
strike
a
blow
at
a
system
he
deplored
since
we
are
concerned
only
indirectly
with
the
affair
it
may
be
stated
very
briefly
the
young
gentleman
in
question
was
a
portuguese
officer
and
a
nephew
of
the
patriarch
of
lisbon
and
the
particular
criticism
to
which
major
berkeley
took
such
just
exception
concerned
the
very
troublesome
dick
butler
our
patrician
ventured
to
comment
with
sneers
and
innuendoes
upon
the
fact
that
the
lieutenant
of
dragoons
continued
missing
and
he
went
so
far
as
to
indulge
in
a
sarcastic
prophecy
that
he
never
would
be
found
major
berkeley
stung
by
the
slur
thus
slyly
cast
upon
british
honour
invited
the
young
gentleman
to
make
himself
more
explicit
i
had
thought
that
i
was
explicit
enough
says
young
impudence
leering
at
the
stalwart
but
if
you
want
it
more
clearly
still
then
i
mean
that
the
undertaking
to
punish
this
ravisher
of
nunneries
is
one
that
you
english
have
never
intended
to
carry
out
to
save
your
faces
you
will
take
good
care
that
lieutenant
butler
is
never
found
indeed
i
doubt
if
he
was
ever
really
major
berkeley
was
quite
uncompromising
and
downright
i
am
afraid
he
had
none
of
the
graces
that
can
exalt
one
of
these
affairs
ye
re
just
a
very
foolish
liar
sir
and
you
deserve
a
good
caning
was
all
he
said
but
the
way
in
which
he
took
his
cane
from
under
his
arm
was
so
suggestive
of
more
to
follow
there
and
then
that
several
of
the
company
laid
preventive
hands
upon
him
instantly
the
patriarch
s
nephew
very
white
and
very
fierce
to
hear
himself
addressed
in
terms
which
out
of
respect
for
his
august
and
powerful
uncle
had
never
been
used
to
him
before
demanded
instant
satisfaction
he
got
it
next
morning
in
the
shape
of
of
lead
through
his
foolish
brain
and
a
terrible
uproar
ensued
to
appease
it
a
scapegoat
was
necessary
as
samoval
so
truly
said
the
mob
is
a
ferocious
god
to
whom
sacrifices
must
be
made
in
this
instance
the
sacrifice
of
course
was
major
berkeley
he
was
broken
and
sent
home
to
cut
his
pigtail
the
adornment
still
clung
to
by
the
and
retire
into
private
life
whereby
the
british
army
was
deprived
of
an
officer
of
singularly
brilliant
promise
thus
you
see
the
score
against
poor
richard
butler
that
foolish
victim
of
wine
and
circumstance
went
on
increasing
but
in
my
haste
to
usher
major
berkeley
out
of
a
narrative
which
he
touches
merely
at
a
tangent
i
am
guilty
of
violating
the
chronological
order
of
the
events
the
ship
in
which
major
berkeley
went
home
to
england
and
the
rural
life
was
the
frigate
telemachus
and
the
telemachus
had
but
dropped
anchor
in
the
tagus
at
the
date
with
which
i
am
immediately
concerned
she
came
with
certain
stores
and
a
heavy
load
of
mails
for
the
troops
and
it
would
be
a
full
fortnight
before
she
would
sail
again
for
home
her
officers
would
be
ashore
during
the
time
the
welcome
guests
of
the
officers
of
the
garrison
bearing
their
share
in
the
gaieties
with
which
the
latter
strove
to
kill
the
time
of
waiting
for
events
and
marcus
glennie
the
captain
of
the
frigate
an
old
friend
of
tremayne
s
was
by
virtue
of
that
friendship
an
almost
daily
visitor
at
the
adjutant
s
quarters
but
there
again
i
am
anticipating
the
telemachus
came
to
her
moorings
in
the
tagus
at
which
for
the
present
we
may
leave
her
on
the
morning
of
the
day
that
was
to
close
with
count
redondo
s
ball
lady
o
moy
had
risen
late
taking
from
one
end
of
the
day
what
she
must
relinquish
to
the
other
that
thus
fully
rested
she
might
look
her
best
that
night
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
was
devoted
to
preparation
it
was
amazing
even
to
herself
what
an
amount
of
detail
there
was
to
be
considered
and
from
sylvia
she
received
but
very
indifferent
assistance
there
were
times
when
she
regretfully
suspected
in
sylvia
a
lack
of
proper
womanliness
a
taint
almost
of
masculinity
there
was
to
lady
o
moy
s
mind
something
very
wrong
about
a
woman
who
preferred
a
canter
to
a
waltz
it
was
unnatural
it
was
suspicious
she
was
not
quite
sure
that
it
wasn
t
vaguely
immoral
at
last
there
had
been
dinner
to
which
she
came
a
full
late
but
of
so
ravishing
and
angelic
an
appearance
that
the
sight
of
her
was
sufficient
to
mollify
sir
terence
s
impatience
and
stifle
the
withering
sarcasms
he
had
been
laboriously
preparing
after
dinner
which
was
taken
at
six
o
clock
there
was
still
an
hour
to
spare
before
the
carriage
would
come
to
take
them
into
lisbon
sir
terence
pleaded
stress
of
work
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
the
telemachus
that
morning
and
withdrew
with
tremayne
to
the
official
quarters
to
spend
that
hour
in
disposing
of
some
of
the
many
matters
awaiting
his
attention
sylvia
who
to
lady
o
moy
s
exasperation
seemed
now
for
the
first
time
to
give
a
thought
to
what
she
should
wear
that
night
went
off
in
haste
to
gown
herself
and
so
lady
o
moy
was
left
to
her
own
resources
which
i
assure
you
were
few
indeed
the
evening
being
calm
and
warm
she
sauntered
out
into
the
open
she
was
more
or
less
annoyed
with
everybody
with
sir
terence
and
tremayne
for
their
assiduity
to
duty
and
with
sylvia
for
postponing
all
thought
of
dressing
until
this
eleventh
hour
when
she
might
have
been
better
employed
in
beguiling
her
ladyship
s
loneliness
in
this
petulant
mood
lady
o
moy
crossed
the
quadrangle
loitered
a
moment
by
the
table
and
chairs
placed
under
the
trellis
and
considered
sitting
there
to
await
the
others
finally
however
attracted
by
the
glory
of
the
sunset
behind
the
hills
towards
abrantes
she
sauntered
out
on
to
the
terrace
to
the
intense
thankfulness
of
a
poor
wretch
who
had
waited
there
for
the
past
ten
hours
in
the
almost
despairing
hope
that
precisely
such
a
thing
might
happen
she
was
leaning
upon
the
balustrade
when
a
rustle
in
the
pines
below
drew
her
attention
the
rustle
worked
swiftly
upwards
and
round
to
the
bushes
on
her
right
and
her
eyes
faintly
startled
followed
its
career
what
time
she
stood
tense
and
vaguely
frightened
then
the
bushes
parted
and
a
limping
figure
that
leaned
heavily
upon
a
stick
disclosed
itself
a
shaggy
man
in
the
garb
of
a
peasant
and
marvel
of
marvels
this
figure
spoke
her
name
sharply
warningly
almost
before
she
had
time
to
think
of
screaming
una
una
don
t
move
the
voice
was
certainly
the
voice
of
butler
but
how
came
that
voice
into
the
body
of
this
peasant
terrified
with
drumming
pulses
yet
obedient
to
the
injunction
she
remained
without
speech
or
movement
whilst
crouching
so
as
to
keep
below
the
level
of
the
balustrade
the
man
crept
forward
until
he
was
immediately
before
and
below
her
she
stared
into
that
haggard
face
and
through
the
of
stubbly
beard
gradually
made
out
the
features
of
her
brother
richard
the
name
broke
from
her
in
a
scream
sh
he
waved
his
hands
in
wild
alarm
to
repress
her
for
god
s
sake
be
quiet
it
s
a
ruined
man
i
am
if
they
find
me
here
you
ll
have
heard
what
s
happened
to
me
she
nodded
and
uttered
a
is
there
anywhere
you
can
hide
me
can
you
get
me
into
the
house
without
being
seen
i
am
almost
starving
and
my
leg
is
on
fire
i
was
wounded
three
days
ago
to
make
matters
worse
than
they
were
already
i
have
been
lying
in
the
woods
there
watching
for
the
chance
to
find
you
alone
since
sunrise
this
morning
and
it
s
devil
a
bite
or
sup
i
ve
had
since
this
time
poor
poor
richard
she
leaned
down
towards
him
in
an
attitude
of
compassionate
ministering
grace
but
why
why
did
you
not
come
up
to
the
house
and
ask
for
me
no
one
would
have
recognised
terence
would
if
he
had
seen
but
terence
wouldn
t
have
mattered
terence
will
help
terence
he
almost
laughed
from
excess
of
bitterness
labouring
under
an
egotistical
sense
of
wrong
he
s
the
last
man
i
should
wish
to
meet
as
i
have
good
reason
to
know
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
i
should
have
come
to
you
a
month
ago
immediately
after
this
trouble
of
mine
as
it
is
i
kept
away
until
despair
left
me
no
other
choice
una
on
no
account
a
word
of
my
presence
to
but
he
s
my
husband
sure
and
he
s
also
and
if
i
know
him
at
all
he
s
the
very
man
to
place
official
duty
and
honour
and
all
the
rest
of
it
above
family
oh
richard
how
little
you
know
terence
how
wrong
you
are
to
misjudge
him
like
this
right
or
wrong
i
d
prefer
not
to
take
the
risk
it
might
end
in
my
being
shot
one
fine
morning
before
richard
for
god
s
sake
less
of
your
richard
it
s
all
the
world
will
be
hearing
you
can
you
hide
me
do
you
think
for
a
day
or
two
if
you
can
t
i
ll
be
after
shifting
for
myself
as
best
i
can
i
ve
been
playing
the
part
of
an
english
overseer
from
bearsley
s
wine
farm
and
it
has
brought
me
all
the
way
from
the
douro
in
safety
but
the
strain
of
it
and
the
eternal
fear
of
discovery
are
beginning
to
break
me
and
now
there
s
this
infernal
wound
i
was
assaulted
by
a
footpad
near
abrantes
as
if
i
was
worth
robbing
anyhow
i
gave
the
fellow
more
than
i
took
unless
i
have
rest
i
think
i
shall
go
mad
and
give
myself
up
to
the
to
be
shot
and
done
why
do
you
talk
of
being
shot
you
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
that
why
should
you
fear
it
now
butler
was
aware
having
gathered
the
information
lately
on
his
travels
of
the
undertaking
given
by
the
british
to
the
council
of
regency
with
regard
to
himself
but
irresponsible
egotist
though
he
might
be
yet
in
common
with
others
he
was
actuated
by
the
desire
which
his
sister
s
fragile
loveliness
inspired
in
every
one
to
spare
her
unnecessary
pain
or
anxiety
it
s
not
myself
will
take
any
risks
he
said
again
we
are
at
war
and
when
men
are
at
war
killing
becomes
a
sort
of
habit
and
one
life
more
or
less
is
neither
here
nor
and
upon
that
he
renewed
his
plea
that
she
should
hide
him
if
she
could
and
that
on
no
account
should
she
tell
a
single
soul
and
sir
terence
least
of
any
of
his
presence
having
driven
him
to
the
verge
of
frenzy
by
the
waste
of
precious
moments
in
vain
argument
she
gave
him
at
last
the
promise
he
required
go
back
to
the
bushes
there
she
bade
him
and
wait
until
i
come
for
you
i
will
make
sure
that
the
coast
is
contiguous
to
her
which
overlooked
the
quadrangle
there
was
a
small
alcove
which
had
been
converted
into
a
storeroom
for
the
array
of
trunks
and
dress
boxes
that
lady
o
moy
had
brought
from
england
a
door
opening
directly
from
her
dressing
room
communicated
with
this
alcove
and
of
that
door
bridget
her
maid
was
in
possession
of
the
key
as
she
hurried
now
indoors
she
happened
to
meet
bridget
on
the
stairs
the
maid
announced
herself
on
her
way
to
supper
in
the
servants
quarters
and
apologised
for
her
presumption
in
assuming
that
her
ladyship
would
no
further
require
her
services
that
evening
but
since
it
fell
in
so
admirably
with
her
ladyship
s
own
wishes
she
insisted
with
quite
unusual
solicitude
with
vehemence
almost
that
bridget
should
proceed
upon
her
way
just
give
me
the
key
of
the
alcove
she
said
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
want
to
can
t
i
get
them
your
ladyship
thank
you
bridget
i
prefer
to
get
them
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
bridget
produced
a
bunch
of
keys
which
she
surrendered
to
her
mistress
having
picked
out
for
her
the
one
required
lady
o
moy
went
up
to
come
down
again
the
moment
that
bridget
had
disappeared
the
quadrangle
was
deserted
the
household
disposed
of
and
it
wanted
yet
to
the
time
for
which
the
carriage
was
ordered
no
moment
could
have
been
more
propitious
but
in
any
case
no
concealment
was
attempted
since
if
detected
it
must
have
provoked
suspicions
hardly
likely
to
be
aroused
in
any
other
way
when
lady
o
moy
returned
indoors
in
the
gathering
dusk
she
was
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
the
limping
fugitive
who
might
had
he
been
seen
have
been
supposed
some
messenger
or
perhaps
some
person
employed
about
the
house
or
gardens
coming
to
her
ladyship
for
instructions
no
one
saw
them
however
and
they
gained
the
and
thence
the
alcove
in
complete
safety
there
whilst
richard
allowing
his
exhaustion
at
last
to
conquer
him
sank
heavily
down
upon
one
of
his
sister
s
many
trunks
recking
nothing
of
the
havoc
wrought
in
its
priceless
contents
her
ladyship
all
collapsed
limply
upon
another
but
there
was
no
rest
for
her
richard
s
wound
required
attention
and
he
was
faint
for
want
of
meat
and
drink
so
having
procured
him
the
wherewithal
to
wash
and
dress
his
hurt
a
nasty
which
had
penetrated
to
the
bone
of
his
thigh
the
very
sight
of
which
turned
her
ladyship
sick
and
faint
she
went
to
forage
for
him
in
a
haste
increased
by
the
fact
that
time
was
growing
short
on
the
sideboard
from
the
remains
of
dinner
she
found
and
furtively
abstracted
what
she
needed
best
part
of
a
roast
chicken
a
small
loaf
and
a
of
collares
mullins
the
butler
would
no
doubt
be
exercised
presently
when
he
discovered
the
abstraction
let
him
blame
one
of
the
footmen
sir
terence
s
orderly
or
the
cat
it
mattered
nothing
to
lady
o
moy
having
devoured
the
food
and
consumed
the
wine
richard
s
exhaustion
assumed
the
form
of
a
lethargic
torpor
to
sleep
was
now
his
overmastering
desire
she
fetched
him
rugs
and
pillows
and
he
made
himself
a
couch
upon
the
floor
she
had
demurred
of
course
when
he
himself
had
suggested
this
she
could
not
conceive
of
any
one
sleeping
anywhere
but
in
a
bed
but
dick
made
short
work
of
that
illusion
haven
t
i
been
in
hiding
for
the
last
six
weeks
he
asked
her
and
haven
t
i
been
thankful
to
sleep
in
a
ditch
and
wasn
t
i
campaigning
before
that
i
tell
you
i
couldn
t
sleep
in
a
bed
it
s
a
habit
i
ve
lost
convinced
she
gave
way
we
ll
talk
una
he
promised
her
as
he
stretched
himself
luxuriously
upon
that
hard
couch
but
meanwhile
on
your
life
not
a
word
to
any
one
you
understand
of
course
i
understand
my
poor
she
stooped
to
kiss
him
but
he
was
fast
asleep
already
she
went
out
and
locked
the
door
and
when
on
the
point
of
setting
out
for
count
redondo
s
she
returned
the
bunch
of
keys
to
bridget
the
key
of
the
alcove
was
missing
i
shall
require
it
again
in
the
morning
bridget
she
explained
lightly
and
then
added
kindly
as
it
seemed
don
t
wait
for
me

to

i
shall
be

miss
armytage
s
pearls
lady
o
moy
and
miss
armytage
drove
alone
together
into
lisbon
the
adjutant
still
occupied
would
follow
as
soon
as
he
possibly
could
whilst
captain
tremayne
would
go
on
directly
from
the
lodgings
which
he
shared
in
alcantara
with
major
carruthers
also
of
the
adjutant
s
staff
whither
he
had
ridden
to
dress
some
twenty
minutes
earlier
are
you
ill
una
had
been
sylvia
s
concerned
greeting
of
her
cousin
when
she
came
within
the
range
of
the
carriage
lamps
you
are
pale
as
a
to
this
her
ladyship
had
replied
mechanically
that
a
slight
headache
troubled
her
but
now
that
they
sat
side
by
side
in
the
well
upholstered
carriage
miss
armytage
became
aware
that
her
companion
was
trembling
una
dear
whatever
is
the
matter
had
it
not
been
for
the
dominant
fear
that
the
shedding
of
tears
would
render
her
countenance
unsightly
lady
o
moy
would
have
yielded
to
her
feelings
and
wept
heroically
in
the
cause
of
her
own
flawless
beauty
she
conquered
the
almost
overmastering
inclination
i
i
have
been
so
troubled
about
richard
she
faltered
it
is
preying
upon
my
poor
dear
in
sheer
motherliness
miss
armytage
put
an
arm
about
her
cousin
and
drew
her
close
we
must
hope
for
the
now
if
you
have
understood
anything
of
the
character
of
lady
o
moy
you
will
have
understood
that
the
burden
of
a
secret
was
the
last
burden
that
such
a
nature
was
capable
of
carrying
it
was
because
dick
was
fully
aware
of
this
that
he
had
so
emphatically
and
repeatedly
impressed
upon
her
the
necessity
for
saying
not
a
word
to
any
one
of
his
presence
she
realised
in
her
vague
way
or
rather
she
believed
it
since
he
had
assured
her
that
there
would
be
grave
danger
to
him
if
he
were
discovered
but
discovery
was
one
thing
and
the
sharing
of
a
confidence
as
to
his
presence
another
that
confidence
must
certainly
be
shared
lady
o
moy
was
in
an
emotional
maelstrom
that
swept
her
towards
a
cataract
the
cataract
might
inspire
her
with
dread
standing
as
it
did
for
death
and
disaster
but
the
maelstrom
was
not
to
be
resisted
she
was
helpless
in
it
unequal
to
breasting
such
strong
waters
she
who
in
all
her
futile
charming
life
had
been
borne
snugly
in
safe
crafts
that
were
steered
by
others
remained
but
to
choose
her
confidant
nature
suggested
terence
but
it
was
against
terence
in
particular
that
she
had
been
warned
circumstance
now
offered
sylvia
armytage
but
pride
or
vanity
if
you
prefer
it
denied
her
here
sylvia
was
an
inexperienced
young
girl
as
she
herself
had
so
often
found
occasion
to
remind
her
cousin
moreover
she
fostered
the
fond
illusion
that
sylvia
looked
to
her
for
precept
that
upon
sylvia
s
life
she
exercised
a
precious
guiding
influence
how
then
should
the
supporting
lean
upon
the
supported
yet
since
she
must
there
and
then
lean
upon
something
or
succumb
instantly
and
completely
she
chose
a
middle
course
a
sort
of
temporary
assistance
i
have
been
imagining
things
she
said
it
may
be
a
premonition
i
don
t
know
do
you
believe
in
premonitions
sylvia
sometimes
sylvia
humoured
her
i
have
been
imagining
that
if
dick
is
hiding
a
fugitive
he
might
naturally
come
to
me
for
help
i
am
fanciful
perhaps
she
added
hastily
lest
she
should
have
said
too
much
but
there
it
is
all
day
the
notion
has
clung
to
me
and
i
have
been
asking
myself
desperately
what
i
should
do
in
such
a
time
enough
to
consider
it
when
it
happens
una
after
all
i
know
her
ladyship
interrupted
on
that
note
of
petulance
of
hers
i
know
of
course
but
i
think
i
should
be
easier
in
my
mind
if
i
could
find
an
answer
to
my
doubt
if
i
knew
what
to
do
to
whom
to
appeal
for
assistance
for
i
am
afraid
that
i
should
be
very
helpless
myself
there
is
terence
of
course
but
i
am
a
little
afraid
of
terence
he
has
got
dick
out
of
so
many
scrapes
and
he
is
so
impatient
of
poor
dick
i
am
afraid
he
doesn
t
understand
him
and
so
i
should
be
a
little
frightened
of
appealing
to
terence
no
said
sylvia
gravely
i
shouldn
t
go
to
terence
indeed
he
is
the
last
man
to
whom
i
should
you
say
that
too
exclaimed
her
ladyship
why
quoth
sylvia
sharply
who
else
has
said
it
there
was
a
brief
pause
in
which
lady
o
moy
shuddered
she
had
been
so
near
to
betraying
herself
how
very
quick
and
shrewd
sylvia
was
she
made
however
a
good
recovery
myself
of
course
it
is
what
i
have
thought
myself
there
is
count
samoval
he
promised
that
if
ever
any
such
thing
happened
he
would
help
me
and
he
assured
me
i
could
count
upon
him
i
think
it
may
have
been
his
offer
that
made
me
i
should
go
to
sir
terence
before
i
went
to
count
samoval
by
which
i
mean
that
i
should
not
go
to
count
samoval
at
all
under
any
circumstances
i
do
not
trust
you
said
so
once
before
dear
said
lady
o
moy
and
you
assured
me
that
i
spoke
out
of
the
fullness
of
my
ignorance
and
ah
forgive
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
no
doubt
you
were
right
but
remember
that
instinct
is
most
alive
in
the
ignorant
and
inexperienced
and
that
instinct
is
often
a
surer
guide
than
reason
yet
if
you
want
reason
i
can
supply
that
too
count
samoval
is
the
intimate
friend
of
the
marquis
of
minas
who
remains
a
member
of
the
government
and
who
next
to
the
principal
souza
was
and
no
doubt
is
the
most
bitter
opponent
of
the
british
policy
in
portugal
yet
count
samoval
one
of
the
largest
landowners
in
the
north
and
the
nobleman
who
has
perhaps
suffered
most
severely
from
that
policy
represents
himself
as
its
most
vigorous
lady
o
moy
listened
in
growing
amazement
also
she
was
a
little
shocked
it
seemed
to
her
almost
indecent
that
a
young
girl
should
know
so
much
about
politics
so
much
of
which
she
herself
a
married
woman
and
the
wife
of
the
was
completely
in
ignorance
save
us
child
she
ejaculated
you
are
so
extraordinarily
i
have
talked
to
captain
tremayne
said
sylvia
he
has
explained
all
extraordinary
conversation
for
a
young
man
to
hold
with
a
young
girl
pronounced
her
ladyship
terence
never
talked
of
such
things
to
terence
was
too
busy
making
love
to
you
said
sylvia
and
there
was
the
least
suspicion
of
regret
in
her
almost
boyish
voice
that
may
account
for
it
her
ladyship
confessed
and
fell
for
a
moment
into
consideration
of
that
delicious
and
rather
amusing
past
when
o
moy
s
ferocious
hesitancy
and
flaming
jealousy
had
delighted
her
with
the
full
perception
of
her
beauty
s
power
with
a
rush
however
the
present
forced
itself
back
upon
her
notice
but
i
still
don
t
see
why
count
samoval
should
have
offered
me
assistance
if
he
did
not
intend
to
grant
it
when
the
time
sylvia
explained
that
it
was
from
the
portuguese
government
that
the
demand
for
justice
upon
the
violator
of
the
nunnery
at
tavora
emanated
and
that
samoval
s
offer
might
be
calculated
to
obtain
him
information
of
butler
s
whereabouts
when
they
became
known
so
that
he
might
surrender
him
to
the
government
my
dear
lady
o
moy
was
shocked
almost
beyond
expression
how
you
must
dislike
the
man
to
suggest
that
he
could
be
such
a
such
a
i
do
not
suggest
that
he
could
be
i
warn
you
never
to
run
the
risk
of
testing
him
he
may
be
as
honest
in
this
matter
as
he
pretends
but
if
ever
dick
were
to
come
to
you
for
help
you
must
take
no
the
phrase
was
a
happier
one
than
sylvia
could
suppose
it
was
almost
the
very
phrase
that
dick
himself
had
used
and
its
reiteration
by
another
bore
conviction
to
her
ladyship
to
whom
then
should
i
go
she
demanded
plaintively
and
sylvia
speaking
with
knowledge
remembering
the
promise
that
tremayne
had
given
her
answered
readily
there
is
but
one
man
whose
assistance
you
could
safely
seek
indeed
i
wonder
you
should
not
have
thought
of
him
in
the
first
instance
since
he
is
your
own
as
well
as
dick
s
lifelong
ned
tremayne
her
ladyship
fell
into
thought
do
you
know
i
am
a
little
afraid
of
ned
he
is
so
very
sober
and
cold
you
do
mean
ned
don
t
you
whom
else
should
i
mean
but
what
could
he
do
my
dear
how
should
i
know
but
at
least
i
know
for
i
think
i
can
be
sure
of
this
that
he
will
not
lack
the
will
to
help
you
and
to
have
the
will
in
a
man
like
captain
tremayne
is
to
find
a
the
confident
almost
respectful
tone
in
which
she
spoke
arrested
her
ladyship
s
attention
it
promptly
sent
her
off
at
a
tangent
you
like
ned
don
t
you
dear
i
think
everybody
likes
sylvia
s
voice
was
now
studiously
cold
yes
but
i
don
t
mean
quite
in
that
and
then
before
the
subject
could
be
further
pursued
the
carriage
rolled
to
a
standstill
in
a
flood
of
light
from
gaping
portals
scattering
a
mob
of
curious
intersprinkled
with
chairmen
footmen
linkmen
and
all
the
valetaille
that
hovers
about
the
functions
of
the
great
world
the
carriage
door
was
flung
open
and
the
steps
let
down
a
brace
of
footmen
plump
as
capons
in
gorgeous
liveries
bowed
powdered
heads
and
proffered
scarlet
arms
to
assist
the
ladies
to
alight
above
in
the
crowded
spacious
colonnaded
vestibule
at
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
they
were
captain
tremayne
who
had
just
arrived
with
major
carruthers
both
resplendent
in
full
dress
and
captain
marcus
glennie
of
the
telemachus
in
blue
and
gold
together
they
ascended
the
great
staircase
lined
with
chatting
groups
and
ablaze
with
uniforms
military
naval
and
diplomatic
british
and
portuguese
to
be
welcomed
above
by
the
count
and
countess
of
redondo
lady
o
moy
s
entrance
of
the
ballroom
produced
the
effect
to
which
custom
had
by
now
inured
her
soon
she
found
herself
the
centre
of
assiduous
attentions
cavalrymen
in
blue
riflemen
in
green
scarlet
officers
of
the
line
regiments
winged
rakishly
pelissed
hussars
and
all
the
smaller
fry
of
court
and
camp
fluttered
insistently
about
her
it
was
no
novelty
to
her
who
had
been
the
recipient
of
such
homage
since
her
first
ball
five
years
ago
at
dublin
castle
and
yet
the
wine
of
it
had
gone
ever
to
her
head
a
little
but
she
was
rather
pale
and
listless
her
loveliness
emphasised
thereby
perhaps
an
unusual
air
of
indifference
hung
about
her
as
she
stood
there
amid
this
throng
of
martial
jostlers
who
craved
the
honour
of
a
dance
and
at
whom
she
smiled
a
thought
mechanically
over
the
top
of
her
slowly
moving
fan
the
first
quadrille
impended
and
the
senior
service
had
carried
off
the
prize
from
under
the
noses
of
the
landsmen
as
she
was
swept
away
by
captain
glennie
she
came
face
to
face
with
tremayne
who
was
passing
with
sylvia
on
his
arm
she
stopped
and
tapped
his
arm
with
her
fan
you
haven
t
asked
to
dance
ned
she
reproached
him
with
reluctance
i
but
i
don
t
intend
that
you
shall
i
have
something
to
say
to
he
met
her
glance
and
found
it
oddly
serious
most
oddly
serious
for
her
responding
to
its
entreaty
he
murmured
a
promise
in
courteous
terms
of
delight
at
so
much
honour
but
either
he
forgot
the
promise
or
did
not
conceive
its
redemption
to
be
an
urgent
matter
for
the
quadrille
being
done
he
sauntered
through
one
of
the
crowded
with
miss
armytage
and
brought
her
to
the
cool
of
a
deserted
balcony
above
the
garden
beyond
this
was
the
river
agleam
with
the
lights
of
the
british
fleet
that
rode
at
anchor
on
its
placid
bosom
una
will
be
waiting
for
you
miss
armytage
reminded
him
she
was
leaning
on
the
sill
of
the
balcony
standing
erect
beside
her
he
considered
the
graceful
profile
sharply
outlined
against
a
background
of
gloom
by
the
light
from
the
windows
behind
them
a
heavy
curl
of
her
dark
hair
lay
upon
a
neck
as
flawlessly
white
as
the
rope
of
pearls
that
swung
from
it
with
which
her
fingers
were
now
idly
toying
it
were
difficult
to
say
which
most
engaged
his
thoughts
the
profile
the
lovely
line
of
neck
or
the
rope
of
pearls
these
latter
were
of
price
such
things
as
it
might
seldom
and
then
only
by
sacrifice
lie
within
the
means
of
captain
tremayne
to
offer
to
the
woman
whom
he
took
to
wife
he
so
lost
himself
upon
that
train
of
thought
that
she
was
forced
to
repeat
her
reminder
una
will
be
waiting
for
you
captain
scarcely
as
eagerly
he
answered
as
others
will
be
waiting
for
she
laughed
amusedly
a
frank
boyish
laugh
i
thank
you
for
not
saying
as
eagerly
as
i
am
waiting
for
miss
armytage
i
have
ever
cultivated
but
we
are
dealing
with
oh
no
surmise
at
all
i
speak
of
what
i
and
so
do
and
yet
again
she
repeated
una
will
be
waiting
for
he
sighed
and
stiffened
slightly
of
course
if
you
insist
said
he
and
made
ready
to
reconduct
her
she
swung
round
as
if
to
go
but
checked
and
looked
him
frankly
in
the
eyes
why
will
you
for
ever
be
misunderstanding
me
she
challenged
him
perhaps
it
is
the
inevitable
result
of
my
overanxiety
to
then
begin
by
taking
me
more
literally
and
do
not
read
into
my
words
more
meaning
than
i
intend
to
give
them
when
i
say
una
is
waiting
for
you
i
state
a
simple
fact
not
a
command
that
you
shall
go
to
her
indeed
i
want
first
to
talk
to
if
i
might
take
you
literally
now
should
i
have
suffered
you
to
bring
me
here
if
i
did
not
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
contrite
and
something
shaken
out
of
his
imperturbability
sylvia
he
ventured
very
boldly
and
there
checked
so
terrified
as
to
be
a
shame
to
his
brave
scarlet
uniform
yes
she
said
she
was
leaning
upon
the
balcony
again
and
in
such
a
way
now
that
he
could
no
longer
see
her
profile
but
her
fingers
were
busy
at
the
pearls
once
more
and
this
he
saw
and
seeing
recovered
himself
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
he
questioned
in
his
smooth
level
voice
had
he
not
looked
away
as
he
spoke
he
might
have
observed
that
her
fingers
tightened
their
grip
of
the
pearls
almost
convulsively
as
if
to
break
the
rope
it
was
a
gesture
slight
and
trivial
yet
arguing
perhaps
vexation
but
tremayne
did
not
see
it
and
had
he
seen
it
it
is
odds
it
would
have
conveyed
no
message
to
him
there
fell
a
long
pause
which
he
did
not
venture
to
break
at
last
she
spoke
her
voice
quiet
and
level
as
his
own
had
been
it
is
about
i
had
hoped
he
spoke
very
softly
that
it
was
about
she
flashed
round
upon
him
almost
angrily
why
do
you
utter
these
set
speeches
to
me
she
demanded
and
then
before
he
could
recover
from
his
astonishment
to
make
any
answer
she
had
resumed
a
normal
manner
and
was
talking
quickly
she
told
him
of
una
s
premonitions
about
dick
told
him
in
short
what
it
was
that
una
desired
to
talk
to
him
about
you
bade
her
come
to
me
he
said
of
course
after
your
promise
to
he
was
silent
and
very
thoughtful
for
a
moment
i
wonder
that
una
needed
to
be
told
that
she
had
in
me
a
friend
he
said
slowly
i
wonder
to
whom
she
would
have
gone
on
her
own
impulse
to
count
samoval
miss
armytage
informed
him
samoval
he
rapped
the
name
out
sharply
he
was
clearly
angry
that
man
i
can
t
understand
why
o
moy
should
suffer
him
about
the
house
so
terence
like
everybody
else
will
suffer
anything
that
una
then
terence
is
more
of
a
fool
than
i
ever
there
was
a
brief
pause
if
you
were
to
fail
una
in
this
said
miss
armytage
presently
i
mean
that
unless
you
yourself
give
her
the
assurance
that
you
are
ready
to
do
what
you
can
for
dick
should
the
occasion
arise
i
am
afraid
that
in
her
present
foolish
mood
she
may
still
avail
herself
of
count
samoval
that
would
be
to
give
samoval
a
hold
upon
her
and
i
tremble
to
think
what
the
consequences
might
be
that
man
is
a
snake
a
the
frankness
with
which
she
spoke
was
to
tremayne
full
evidence
of
her
anxiety
he
was
prompt
to
allay
it
she
shall
have
that
assurance
this
very
evening
he
promised
i
at
least
have
not
pledged
my
word
to
anything
or
to
any
one
even
so
he
added
slowly
the
chances
of
my
services
being
ever
required
grow
more
slender
every
day
una
may
be
full
of
premonitions
about
dick
but
between
premonition
and
event
there
is
something
of
a
again
a
pause
and
then
i
am
glad
said
miss
armytage
to
think
that
una
has
a
friend
a
trustworthy
friend
upon
whom
she
can
depend
she
is
so
incapable
of
depending
upon
herself
all
her
life
there
has
been
some
one
at
hand
to
guide
her
and
screen
her
from
unpleasantness
until
she
has
remained
just
a
sweet
dear
child
to
be
taken
by
the
hand
in
every
dark
lane
of
but
she
has
you
miss
me
miss
armytage
spoke
deprecatingly
i
don
t
think
i
am
a
very
able
or
experienced
guide
besides
even
such
as
i
am
she
may
not
have
me
very
long
now
i
had
letters
from
home
this
morning
father
is
not
very
well
and
mother
writes
that
he
misses
me
i
am
thinking
of
returning
but
but
you
have
only
just
come
she
brightened
and
laughed
at
the
dismay
in
his
voice
indeed
i
have
been
here
six
she
looked
out
over
the
shimmering
moonlit
waters
of
the
tagus
and
the
shadowy
ghostly
ships
of
the
british
fleet
that
rode
at
anchor
there
and
her
eyes
were
wistful
her
fingers
with
that
little
gesture
peculiar
to
her
in
moments
of
constraint
were
again
entwining
themselves
in
her
rope
of
pearls
yes
she
said
almost
musingly
i
think
i
must
be
going
he
was
dismayed
he
realised
that
the
moment
for
action
had
come
his
heart
was
sounding
the
charge
within
him
and
then
that
cursed
rope
of
pearls
emblem
of
the
wealth
and
luxury
in
which
she
had
been
nurtured
stood
like
an
impassable
abattis
across
his
path
you
you
will
be
glad
to
go
of
course
he
suggested
hardly
that
it
has
been
very
pleasant
she
sighed
we
shall
miss
you
very
much
he
said
gloomily
the
house
at
monsanto
will
not
be
the
same
when
you
are
gone
una
will
be
lost
and
desolate
without
it
occurs
to
me
sometimes
she
said
slowly
that
the
people
about
una
think
too
much
of
una
and
too
little
of
it
was
a
cryptic
speech
in
another
it
might
have
signified
a
spitefulness
unthinkable
in
sylvia
armytage
therefore
it
puzzled
him
very
deeply
he
stood
silent
wondering
what
precisely
she
might
mean
and
thus
in
silence
they
continued
for
a
spell
then
slowly
she
turned
and
the
blaze
of
light
from
the
windows
fell
about
her
irradiantly
she
was
rather
pale
and
her
eyes
were
of
a
suspiciously
excessive
brightness
and
again
she
made
use
of
the
phrase
una
will
be
waiting
for
yet
as
before
he
stood
silent
and
immovable
considering
her
questioning
himself
searching
her
face
and
his
own
soul
all
he
saw
was
that
rope
of
shimmering
pearls
and
after
all
as
yourself
suggested
it
is
possible
that
others
may
be
waiting
for
me
she
added
presently
instantly
he
was
crestfallen
and
contrite
i
sincerely
beg
your
pardon
miss
armytage
and
with
a
pang
of
which
his
imperturbable
exterior
gave
no
hint
he
proffered
her
his
arm
she
took
it
barely
touching
it
with
her
and
they
the
when
do
you
think
that
you
will
be
leaving
he
asked
her
gently
there
was
a
note
of
harshness
in
the
voice
that
answered
him
i
don
t
know
yet
but
very
soon
the
sooner
the
better
i
and
then
the
sleek
and
courtly
samoval
detaching
from
seeming
to
materialise
out
of
the
glittering
throng
they
had
entered
was
bowing
low
before
her
claiming
her
attention
knowing
her
feelings
tremayne
would
not
have
relinquished
her
but
to
his
infinite
amazement
she
herself
slipped
her
fingers
from
his
scarlet
sleeve
to
place
them
upon
the
black
one
that
samoval
was
gracefully
proffering
and
greeted
samoval
with
a
gay
raillery
as
oddly
in
contrast
with
her
grave
demeanour
towards
the
captain
as
with
her
recent
avowal
of
detestation
for
the
count
stricken
and
half
angry
tremayne
stood
looking
after
them
as
they
receded
towards
the
ballroom
to
increase
his
chagrin
came
a
laugh
from
miss
armytage
sharp
and
rather
strident
floating
towards
him
and
miss
armytage
s
laugh
was
wont
to
be
low
and
restrained
samoval
no
doubt
had
resources
to
amuse
a
woman
even
a
woman
who
instinctively
disliked
him
resources
of
which
captain
tremayne
himself
knew
nothing
and
then
some
one
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
a
very
tall
man
in
a
scarlet
coat
and
tightly
strapped
blue
trousers
stood
beside
him
it
was
colquhoun
grant
the
ablest
intelligence
officer
in
wellington
s
service
why
colonel
cried
tremayne
holding
out
his
hand
i
didn
t
know
you
were
in
i
arrived
only
this
the
keen
eyes
flashed
after
the
disappearing
figures
of
sylvia
and
her
cavalier
tell
me
what
is
the
name
of
the
irresistible
gallant
who
has
so
lightly
ravished
you
of
your
quite
delicious
companion
count
samoval
said
tremayne
shortly
grant
s
face
remained
inscrutable
really
he
said
softly
so
that
is
jeronymo
de
samoval
eh
how
very
interesting
a
great
supporter
of
the
british
policy
therefore
an
altruist
since
himself
he
is
a
sufferer
by
it
and
i
hear
that
he
has
become
a
great
friend
of
o
moy
he
is
at
monsanto
a
good
deal
certainly
tremayne
admitted
most
grant
was
slowly
nodding
and
a
faint
smile
curled
his
thin
sensitive
lips
but
i
m
keeping
you
tremayne
and
no
doubt
you
would
be
dancing
i
shall
perhaps
see
you
i
shall
be
coming
up
to
and
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
passed
on
and
was
gone
chapter
vii
the
ally
tremayne
elbowed
his
way
through
the
gorgeous
crowd
exchanging
greetings
here
and
there
as
he
went
and
so
reached
the
ballroom
during
a
pause
in
the
dancing
he
looked
round
for
lady
o
moy
but
he
could
see
her
nowhere
and
would
never
have
found
her
had
not
carruthers
pointed
out
a
knot
of
officers
and
assured
him
that
the
lady
was
in
the
heart
of
it
and
in
imminent
peril
of
being
suffocated
thither
the
captain
bent
his
steps
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
in
his
singleness
of
purpose
thus
it
happened
that
he
saw
neither
o
moy
who
had
just
arrived
nor
the
massive
decorated
bulk
of
marshal
beresford
with
whom
the
adjutant
stood
in
conversation
on
the
skirts
of
the
throng
that
so
assiduously
worshipped
at
her
ladyship
s
shrine
captain
tremayne
went
through
the
group
with
all
a
sapper
s
skill
at
piercing
obstacles
and
so
came
face
to
face
with
the
lady
of
his
quest
seeing
her
so
radiant
now
with
sparkling
eyes
and
ready
laugh
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
her
haunted
by
any
such
anxieties
as
miss
armytage
had
mentioned
yet
the
moment
she
perceived
him
as
if
his
presence
acted
as
a
reminder
to
lift
her
out
of
the
delicious
present
something
of
her
gaiety
underwent
eclipse
child
of
impulse
that
she
was
she
gave
no
thought
to
her
action
and
the
construction
it
might
possibly
bear
in
the
minds
of
men
chagrined
and
slighted
why
ned
she
cried
you
have
kept
me
and
with
a
complete
and
charming
ignoring
of
the
claims
of
all
who
had
been
before
him
and
who
were
warring
there
for
precedence
of
one
another
she
took
his
arm
in
token
that
she
yielded
herself
to
him
before
even
the
honour
was
so
much
as
solicited
with
nods
and
smiles
to
right
and
left
a
queen
dismissing
her
court
she
passed
on
the
captain
s
arm
through
the
little
crowd
that
gave
way
before
her
dismayed
and
intrigued
and
so
away
o
moy
who
had
been
awaiting
a
favourable
moment
to
present
the
marshal
by
the
marshal
s
own
request
attempted
to
thrust
forward
now
with
beresford
at
his
side
but
the
bowing
line
of
officers
whose
backs
were
towards
him
effectively
barred
his
progress
and
before
they
had
broken
up
that
formation
her
ladyship
and
her
cavalier
were
out
of
sight
lost
in
the
moving
crowd
the
marshal
laughed
the
infallible
reward
of
patience
said
he
and
o
moy
laughed
with
him
but
the
next
moment
he
was
scowling
at
what
he
overheard
on
my
soul
that
was
impudence
an
irish
infantryman
had
protested
have
you
ever
heard
quoth
a
heavy
dragoon
who
was
also
a
heavy
jester
that
in
heaven
the
last
shall
be
first
if
you
pay
court
to
an
angel
you
must
submit
to
celestial
and
bedad
rejoined
the
infantryman
as
there
s
no
marryin
in
heaven
ye
ve
got
to
make
the
best
of
it
with
other
men
s
wives
sure
it
s
a
great
success
that
fellow
should
be
in
paradise
did
ye
remark
the
way
she
melted
to
him
beauty
swooning
at
the
sight
of
temptation
bad
luck
to
him
who
is
he
at
all
they
dispersed
laughing
and
followed
by
o
moy
s
scowling
eyes
it
annoyed
him
that
his
wife
s
thoughtless
conduct
should
render
her
the
butt
of
such
jests
as
these
and
perhaps
a
subject
for
lewd
gossip
he
would
speak
to
her
about
it
later
meanwhile
the
marshal
had
linked
arms
with
him
since
the
privilege
must
be
postponed
said
he
suppose
that
we
seek
supper
i
have
always
found
that
a
man
can
best
heal
in
his
stomach
the
wounds
taken
by
his
his
fleshy
bulk
afforded
a
certain
confirmation
of
the
dictum
with
a
roll
more
suggestive
of
the
than
the
saddle
the
great
man
bore
off
o
moy
in
quest
of
material
consolation
yet
as
they
went
the
adjutant
s
eyes
raked
the
ballroom
in
quest
of
his
wife
that
quest
however
was
unsuccessful
for
his
wife
was
already
in
the
garden
i
want
to
talk
to
you
most
urgently
ned
take
me
somewhere
where
we
can
be
quite
private
she
had
begged
the
captain
somewhere
where
there
is
no
danger
of
being
her
agitation
now
uncontrolled
suggested
to
tremayne
that
the
matter
might
be
far
more
serious
and
urgent
than
miss
armytage
had
represented
it
he
thought
first
of
the
balcony
where
he
had
lately
been
but
then
the
balcony
opened
immediately
from
the
and
was
likely
at
any
moment
to
be
invaded
so
since
the
night
was
soft
and
warm
he
preferred
the
garden
her
ladyship
went
to
find
a
wrap
then
arm
in
arm
they
passed
out
and
were
lost
in
the
shadows
of
an
avenue
of
it
is
about
dick
she
said
breathlessly
i
know
miss
armytage
told
what
did
she
tell
you
that
you
had
a
premonition
that
he
might
come
to
you
for
a
premonition
her
ladyship
laughed
nervously
it
is
more
than
a
premonition
ned
he
has
the
captain
stopped
in
his
stride
and
stood
quite
still
come
he
echoed
dick
sh
she
warned
him
and
sank
her
voice
from
very
instinct
he
came
to
me
this
evening
half
an
hour
before
we
left
home
i
have
put
him
in
an
alcove
adjacent
to
my
for
the
you
have
left
him
there
he
was
alarmed
oh
there
s
no
fear
no
one
ever
goes
there
except
bridget
and
i
have
locked
the
alcove
he
s
fast
asleep
he
was
asleep
before
i
left
the
poor
fellow
was
so
worn
and
followed
details
of
his
appearance
and
a
recital
of
his
wanderings
so
far
as
he
had
made
them
known
to
her
and
he
was
so
insistent
that
no
one
should
know
not
even
terence
must
not
know
he
said
gravely
you
think
that
too
if
terence
knows
well
you
will
regret
it
all
the
days
of
your
life
he
was
so
stern
so
impressive
that
she
begged
for
explanation
he
afforded
it
you
would
be
doing
terence
the
utmost
cruelty
if
you
told
him
you
would
be
compelling
him
to
choose
between
his
honour
and
his
concern
for
you
and
since
he
is
the
very
soul
of
honour
he
must
sacrifice
you
and
himself
your
happiness
and
his
own
everything
that
makes
life
good
for
you
both
to
his
she
was
aghast
for
all
that
she
was
far
from
understanding
but
he
went
on
relentlessly
to
make
his
meaning
clear
for
the
sake
of
o
moy
as
much
as
for
her
own
for
the
sake
of
the
future
of
these
two
people
who
were
perhaps
his
dearest
friends
he
saw
in
what
danger
of
shipwreck
their
happiness
now
stood
and
he
took
the
determination
of
clearly
pointing
out
to
her
every
shoal
in
the
water
through
which
she
must
steer
her
course
since
this
has
happened
una
you
must
be
told
the
whole
truth
you
must
listen
and
above
all
be
reasonable
i
am
dick
s
friend
as
i
am
your
own
and
terence
s
your
father
was
my
best
friend
perhaps
and
my
gratitude
to
him
is
unbounded
as
i
hope
you
know
you
and
dick
are
almost
as
brother
and
sister
to
me
in
spite
of
this
indeed
because
of
this
i
have
prayed
for
news
that
dick
was
her
grasp
interrupted
him
and
he
felt
the
tightening
clutch
of
her
hands
upon
his
arm
in
the
gloom
i
have
prayed
this
for
dick
s
sake
and
more
than
all
for
the
sake
of
your
happiness
and
terence
s
if
dick
is
taken
the
choice
before
terence
is
a
tragic
one
you
will
realise
it
when
i
tell
you
that
duty
forced
him
to
pledge
his
word
to
the
portuguese
government
that
dick
should
be
shot
when
oh
it
was
a
gasp
of
horror
of
incredulity
she
loosed
his
arm
and
drew
away
from
him
it
is
infamous
i
can
t
believe
it
i
can
it
is
true
i
swear
it
to
you
i
was
present
and
i
and
you
allowed
it
what
could
i
do
how
could
i
interfere
besides
the
minister
who
demanded
that
undertaking
knew
nothing
of
the
relationship
between
o
moy
and
this
missing
but
but
he
could
have
been
that
would
have
made
no
difference
unless
it
were
to
create
fresh
she
stood
there
ghostly
white
against
the
gloom
a
dry
sob
broke
from
her
terence
did
that
terence
did
that
she
moaned
and
then
in
a
surge
of
anger
i
shall
never
speak
to
terence
again
i
shall
not
live
with
him
another
day
it
was
infamous
infamous
it
was
not
infamous
it
was
almost
noble
almost
heroic
he
amazed
her
listen
una
and
try
to
he
took
her
arm
again
and
drew
her
gently
on
down
that
avenue
of
darkness
oh
i
understand
she
cried
bitterly
i
understand
perfectly
he
has
always
been
hard
on
dick
he
has
always
made
mountains
out
of
molehills
where
dick
was
concerned
he
forgets
that
dick
is
young
a
mere
boy
he
judges
dick
from
the
standpoint
of
his
own
sober
middle
age
why
he
s
an
old
man
a
wicked
old
man
thus
her
rage
hurling
at
o
moy
what
in
the
insolence
of
her
youth
seemed
the
last
insult
you
are
very
unjust
una
you
are
even
a
little
stupid
he
said
deeming
the
punishment
necessary
and
salutary
stupid
i
stupid
i
have
never
been
called
stupid
but
you
have
undoubtedly
deserved
to
be
he
assured
her
with
perfect
calm
it
took
her
aback
by
its
directness
and
for
a
moment
left
her
without
an
answer
then
i
think
you
had
better
leave
me
she
told
him
frostily
you
forget
perhaps
i
do
he
admitted
that
is
because
i
am
more
concerned
to
think
of
dick
and
terence
and
yourself
sit
down
they
had
reached
a
little
circle
by
a
piece
of
ornamental
water
facing
which
a
seat
had
been
placed
she
sank
to
it
obediently
if
sulkily
it
may
perhaps
help
you
to
understand
what
terence
has
done
when
i
tell
you
that
in
his
place
loving
dick
as
i
do
i
must
have
pledged
myself
precisely
as
he
did
or
else
despised
myself
for
ever
and
being
pledged
i
must
keep
my
word
or
go
in
the
same
he
elaborated
his
argument
by
explaining
the
full
circumstances
under
which
the
pledge
had
been
exacted
but
be
in
no
doubt
about
it
he
concluded
if
terence
knows
of
dick
s
presence
at
monsanto
he
has
no
choice
he
must
deliver
him
up
to
a
firing
party
or
to
a
which
will
inevitably
sentence
him
to
death
no
matter
what
the
defence
that
dick
may
urge
he
is
a
man
prejudged
foredoomed
by
the
necessities
of
war
and
terence
will
do
this
although
it
will
break
his
heart
and
ruin
all
his
life
understand
me
then
that
in
enjoining
you
never
to
allow
terence
to
suspect
that
dick
is
present
i
am
pleading
not
so
much
for
you
or
for
dick
but
for
terence
himself
for
it
is
upon
terence
that
the
hardest
and
most
tragic
suffering
must
fall
now
do
you
understand
i
understand
that
men
are
very
stupid
was
her
way
of
admitting
it
and
you
see
that
you
were
wrong
in
judging
terence
as
you
did
i
i
suppose
she
didn
t
understand
it
all
but
since
tremayne
was
so
insistent
she
supposed
there
must
be
something
in
his
point
of
view
she
had
been
brought
up
in
the
belief
that
ned
tremayne
was
common
sense
incarnate
and
although
she
often
doubted
it
as
you
may
doubt
the
dogmas
of
a
religion
in
which
you
have
been
bred
yet
she
never
openly
rebelled
against
that
inculcated
faith
above
all
she
wanted
to
cry
she
knew
that
it
would
be
very
good
for
her
she
had
often
found
a
singular
relief
in
tears
when
vexed
by
things
beyond
her
understanding
but
she
had
to
think
of
that
flock
of
gallants
in
the
ballroom
waiting
to
pay
court
to
her
and
of
her
duty
towards
them
of
preserving
her
beauty
unimpaired
by
the
ravages
of
a
vented
sorrow
tremayne
sat
down
beside
her
so
now
that
we
understand
each
other
on
that
score
let
us
consider
ways
and
means
to
dispose
of
at
once
she
was
uplifted
and
became
all
eagerness
yes
yes
you
will
help
me
ned
you
can
depend
upon
me
to
do
all
in
human
he
thought
rapidly
and
gave
voice
to
some
of
his
thoughts
if
i
could
i
would
take
him
to
my
lodgings
at
alcantara
but
carruthers
knows
him
and
would
see
him
there
so
that
is
out
of
the
question
then
again
it
is
dangerous
to
move
him
about
at
any
moment
he
might
be
seen
and
hardly
recognised
she
said
his
beard
disguises
him
and
his
dress
she
shuddered
at
the
very
thought
of
the
figure
he
had
cut
he
the
jaunty
dandy
richard
butler
that
is
something
of
course
he
agreed
and
then
asked
how
long
do
you
think
that
you
could
keep
him
hidden
i
don
t
know
you
see
there
s
bridget
she
is
the
only
danger
as
she
has
charge
of
my
it
may
be
desperate
but
can
you
trust
her
oh
i
am
sure
i
can
she
is
devoted
to
me
she
would
do
anything
she
must
be
bought
as
well
devotion
and
gain
when
linked
together
will
form
an
unbreakable
bond
don
t
let
us
be
stingy
una
take
her
into
your
confidence
boldly
and
promise
her
a
hundred
guineas
for
her
silence
payable
on
the
day
that
dick
leaves
the
but
how
are
we
to
get
him
out
of
the
country
i
think
i
know
a
way
i
can
depend
on
marcus
glennie
i
may
tell
him
the
whole
truth
and
the
identity
of
our
man
or
i
may
not
i
must
think
about
that
but
whatever
i
decide
i
am
sure
i
can
induce
glennie
to
take
our
fugitive
home
in
the
telemachus
and
land
him
safely
somewhere
in
ireland
where
he
will
have
to
lose
himself
for
awhile
perhaps
for
glennie
s
sake
it
will
be
safer
not
to
disclose
dick
s
identity
then
if
there
should
be
trouble
later
glennie
having
known
nothing
of
the
real
facts
will
not
be
held
responsible
i
will
talk
to
him
do
you
think
he
will
consent
she
asked
in
strained
anxiety
anxiety
to
have
her
anxieties
dispelled
i
am
sure
he
will
i
can
almost
pledge
my
word
on
it
marcus
would
do
anything
to
serve
me
oh
set
your
mind
at
rest
consider
the
thing
done
keep
dick
safely
hidden
for
a
week
or
so
until
the
telemachus
is
ready
to
sail
he
mustn
t
go
on
board
until
the
last
moment
for
several
reasons
and
i
will
see
to
the
under
that
confident
promise
her
troubles
fell
from
her
as
lightly
as
they
ever
did
you
are
very
good
to
me
ned
forgive
me
what
i
said
just
now
and
i
think
i
understand
about
terence
poor
dear
old
of
course
you
moved
to
comfort
her
as
he
might
have
been
moved
to
comfort
a
child
he
flung
his
arm
along
the
seat
behind
her
and
patted
her
shoulder
soothingly
i
knew
you
would
understand
and
not
a
word
to
terence
not
a
word
that
could
so
much
as
awaken
his
suspicions
remember
oh
i
fell
a
step
upon
the
patch
behind
them
crunching
the
gravel
captain
tremayne
his
arm
still
along
the
back
of
the
seat
and
seeming
to
envelop
her
ladyship
looked
over
her
shoulder
a
tall
figure
was
advancing
briskly
he
recognised
it
even
in
the
gloom
by
its
height
and
gait
and
swing
for
o
moy
s
why
here
is
terence
he
said
easily
so
easily
with
such
frank
and
obvious
honesty
of
welcome
that
the
anger
in
which
o
moy
came
wrapped
fell
from
him
on
the
instant
to
be
replaced
by
shame
i
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
my
dear
he
said
to
una
marshal
beresford
is
anxious
to
pay
you
his
respects
before
he
leaves
and
you
have
been
so
hedged
about
by
gallants
all
the
evening
that
it
s
devil
a
chance
he
s
had
of
approaching
there
was
a
certain
constraint
in
his
voice
for
a
man
may
not
recover
instantly
from
such
feelings
as
those
which
had
fetched
him
down
that
path
at
sight
of
those
two
figures
sitting
so
close
and
intimate
the
young
man
s
arm
so
proprietorialy
about
the
lady
s
shoulders
as
it
seemed
lady
o
moy
sprang
up
at
once
with
a
little
silvery
laugh
that
was
singularly
for
had
not
tremayne
lifted
the
burden
entirely
from
her
shoulders
you
should
have
married
a
dowd
she
mocked
him
then
you
d
have
found
her
more
easily
instead
of
finding
her
dallying
in
the
moonlight
with
my
secretary
he
rallied
back
between
good
and
ill
humour
and
he
turned
to
tremayne
damned
indiscreet
of
you
ned
he
added
more
severely
suppose
you
had
been
seen
by
any
of
the
scandalmongering
old
wives
of
the
garrison
a
nice
thing
for
una
and
a
nice
thing
for
me
begad
to
be
made
the
subject
of
talk
over
the
tremayne
accepted
the
rebuke
in
the
friendly
spirit
in
which
it
appeared
to
be
conveyed
sorry
o
moy
he
said
you
re
quite
right
we
should
have
thought
of
it
everybody
isn
t
to
know
what
our
relations
and
again
he
was
so
manifestly
honest
and
so
completely
at
his
ease
that
it
was
impossible
to
harbour
any
thought
of
evil
and
o
moy
felt
again
the
glow
of
shame
of
suspicions
so
utterly
unworthy
and
dishonouring
chapter
viii
the
intelligence
officer
in
a
small
room
of
count
redondo
s
palace
a
room
that
had
been
set
apart
for
cards
sat
three
men
about
a
they
were
count
samoval
the
elderly
marquis
of
minas
lean
bald
and
vulturine
of
aspect
with
a
eye
that
glared
fiercely
through
a
single
eyeglass
rimmed
in
and
a
gentleman
still
on
the
fair
side
of
middle
age
with
a
face
and
hair
who
wore
the
dark
green
uniform
of
a
major
of
cacadores
considering
his
portuguese
uniform
it
is
odd
that
the
earnest
conversation
amongst
them
should
have
been
conducted
in
french
there
were
cards
on
the
table
but
there
was
no
pretence
of
play
you
might
have
conceived
them
a
group
of
players
who
wearied
of
their
game
had
relinquished
it
for
conversation
they
were
the
only
tenants
of
the
room
which
was
small
and
lighted
by
a
girandole
of
sparkling
crystal
through
the
closed
door
came
faintly
from
the
distant
ballroom
the
strains
of
the
dance
music
with
perhaps
the
single
exception
of
the
principal
souza
the
british
policy
had
no
more
bitter
opponent
in
portugal
than
the
marquis
of
minas
once
a
member
of
the
council
of
regency
before
souza
had
been
elected
to
that
body
he
had
quitted
it
in
disgust
at
the
british
measures
his
chief
ground
of
umbrage
had
been
the
appointment
of
british
officers
to
the
command
of
the
portuguese
regiments
which
formed
the
division
under
marshal
beresford
in
this
he
saw
a
deliberate
insult
and
slight
to
his
country
and
his
countrymen
he
was
a
man
of
burning
and
blinded
patriotism
to
whom
portugal
was
the
most
glorious
nation
in
the
world
he
lived
in
his
country
s
splendid
past
refusing
to
recognise
that
the
days
of
henry
the
navigator
of
vasco
da
gama
of
manuel
the
fortunate
days
in
which
portugal
had
been
great
indeed
among
the
nations
of
the
old
world
were
gone
and
done
with
he
respected
britons
as
great
merchants
and
industrious
traders
but
after
all
merchants
and
traders
are
not
the
peers
of
fighters
on
land
and
sea
of
navigators
conquerors
and
civilisers
such
as
his
countrymen
had
been
such
as
he
believed
them
still
to
be
that
the
descendants
of
gamas
cunhas
magalhaes
and
albuquerques
men
whose
names
were
indelibly
written
upon
the
very
face
of
the
world
should
be
passed
over
whilst
alien
officers
lead
been
brought
in
to
train
and
command
the
portuguese
legions
was
an
affront
to
portugal
which
minas
could
never
forgive
it
was
thus
that
he
had
become
a
rebel
withdrawing
from
a
government
whose
supineness
he
could
not
condone
for
a
while
his
rebellion
had
been
passive
until
the
principal
souza
had
heated
him
in
the
fire
of
his
own
rage
and
fashioned
him
into
an
intriguing
instrument
of
the
first
power
he
was
listening
intently
now
to
the
soft
rapid
speech
of
the
gentleman
in
the
major
s
uniform
of
course
rumours
had
reached
the
prince
of
this
policy
of
devastation
he
was
saying
but
his
highness
has
been
disposed
to
treat
these
rumours
lightly
unable
to
see
as
indeed
are
we
all
what
useful
purpose
such
a
policy
could
finally
serve
he
does
not
underrate
the
talents
of
milord
wellington
as
a
commander
he
does
not
imagine
that
he
would
pursue
such
operations
out
of
pure
wantonness
yet
if
such
operations
are
indeed
being
pursued
what
can
they
be
but
wanton
a
moment
count
he
stayed
samoval
who
was
about
to
interrupt
his
mind
and
manner
were
authoritative
we
know
most
positively
from
the
emperor
s
london
agents
that
the
war
is
unpopular
in
england
we
know
that
public
opinion
is
being
prepared
for
a
british
retreat
for
the
driving
of
the
british
into
the
sea
as
must
inevitably
happen
once
monsieur
le
prince
decides
to
launch
his
bolt
here
in
the
tagus
the
british
fleet
lies
ready
to
embark
the
troops
and
the
british
cabinet
itself
he
spoke
more
slowly
and
emphatically
expects
that
embarkation
to
take
place
at
latest
in
september
which
is
just
about
the
time
that
the
french
offensive
should
be
at
its
height
and
the
french
troops
under
the
very
walls
of
lisbon
i
admit
that
by
this
policy
of
devastation
if
indeed
it
be
true
added
to
a
stubborn
contesting
of
every
foot
of
ground
the
french
advance
may
be
retarded
but
the
process
will
be
costly
to
britain
in
lives
and
and
more
costly
still
to
portugal
croaked
the
marquis
of
minas
and
as
you
say
monsieur
le
marquis
more
costly
still
to
portugal
let
me
for
a
moment
show
you
another
side
of
the
picture
the
french
administration
so
sane
so
cherishing
animated
purely
by
ideas
of
progress
enforcing
wise
and
beneficial
laws
making
ever
for
the
prosperity
and
of
conquered
nations
knows
how
to
render
itself
popular
wherever
it
is
established
this
portugal
knows
already
or
at
least
some
part
of
it
there
was
the
administration
of
soult
in
oporto
so
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
people
that
it
was
no
inconsiderable
party
was
prepared
subject
to
the
emperor
s
consent
to
offer
him
the
crown
and
settle
down
peacefully
under
his
rule
there
was
the
administration
of
junot
in
lisbon
i
ask
you
when
was
lisbon
better
governed
contrast
for
a
moment
with
these
the
present
british
administration
for
it
amounts
to
an
administration
consider
the
burning
grievances
that
must
be
left
behind
by
this
policy
of
laying
the
country
waste
of
pauperising
a
million
people
of
all
degrees
driving
them
homeless
from
the
lands
on
which
they
were
born
after
compelling
them
to
lend
a
hand
in
the
destruction
of
all
that
their
labour
has
built
up
through
long
years
if
any
policy
could
better
serve
the
purposes
of
france
i
know
it
not
the
people
from
here
to
beira
should
be
ready
to
receive
the
french
with
open
arms
and
to
welcome
their
deliverance
from
this
most
costly
and
bitter
british
protection
do
you
messieurs
detect
a
flaw
in
these
arguments
both
shook
their
heads
bien
said
the
major
of
portuguese
cacadores
then
we
reach
one
or
two
only
possible
conclusions
either
these
rumours
of
a
policy
of
devastation
which
have
reached
the
prince
of
esslingen
are
as
utterly
false
as
he
believes
them
to
be
or
to
my
cost
i
know
them
to
be
true
as
i
have
already
told
you
samoval
interrupted
bitterly
or
the
major
persisted
raising
a
hand
to
restrain
the
count
or
there
is
something
further
that
has
not
been
yet
discovered
a
mystery
the
enucleation
of
which
will
shed
light
upon
all
the
rest
since
you
assure
me
monsieur
le
comte
that
milord
wellington
s
policy
is
beyond
doubt
as
reported
to
monsieur
le
marechal
it
but
remains
to
address
ourselves
to
the
discovery
of
the
mystery
underlying
it
what
conclusions
have
you
reached
you
monsieur
de
samoval
have
had
exceptional
opportunities
of
observation
i
i
am
afraid
my
opportunities
have
been
none
so
exceptional
as
you
suppose
replied
samoval
with
a
dubious
shake
of
his
sleek
dark
head
at
one
time
i
founded
great
hopes
in
lady
o
moy
but
lady
o
moy
is
a
fool
and
does
not
enjoy
her
husband
s
confidence
in
official
matters
what
she
knows
i
know
unfortunately
it
does
not
amount
to
very
much
one
conclusion
however
i
have
reached
wellington
is
preparing
in
portugal
a
snare
for
massena
s
a
snare
hum
the
major
pursed
his
full
lips
into
a
smile
of
scorn
there
can
not
be
a
trap
with
two
exits
my
friend
massena
enters
portugal
at
almeida
and
marches
to
lisbon
and
the
open
sea
he
may
be
inconvenienced
or
hampered
in
his
march
but
its
goal
is
certain
where
then
can
lie
the
snare
your
theory
presupposes
an
impassable
barrier
to
arrest
the
french
when
they
are
deep
in
the
country
and
an
overwhelming
force
to
cut
off
their
retreat
when
that
barrier
is
reached
the
overwhelming
force
does
not
exist
and
can
not
be
manufactured
as
for
the
barrier
no
barrier
that
it
lies
within
human
power
to
construct
lies
beyond
french
power
to
i
should
not
make
too
sure
of
that
samoval
warned
him
and
you
have
overlooked
the
major
glanced
at
the
count
sharply
and
without
satisfaction
he
accounted
himself
trained
as
he
had
been
under
the
very
eye
of
the
great
emperor
of
some
force
in
strategy
and
tactics
a
player
too
well
versed
in
the
game
to
overlook
the
possible
moves
of
an
opponent
ha
he
said
with
the
ghost
of
a
sneer
for
instance
monsieur
le
comte
the
overwhelming
force
exists
said
samoval
where
is
it
then
whence
has
it
been
created
if
you
refer
to
the
united
british
and
portuguese
troops
you
will
be
good
enough
to
bear
in
mind
that
they
will
be
retreating
before
the
prince
they
can
not
at
once
be
before
and
behind
the
man
s
cool
assurance
and
cooler
contempt
of
samoval
s
views
stung
the
count
into
some
sharpness
are
you
seeking
information
sir
or
are
you
bestowing
it
he
inquired
ah
your
pardon
monsieur
le
comte
i
inquire
of
course
i
put
forward
arguments
to
anticipate
conditions
that
may
possibly
be
samoval
waived
the
point
there
is
another
force
besides
the
british
and
portuguese
troops
that
you
have
left
out
of
your
and
that
the
major
was
still
faintly
incredulous
you
should
remember
what
wellington
obviously
remembers
that
a
french
army
depends
for
its
sustenance
upon
the
country
it
is
invading
that
is
why
wellington
is
stripping
the
french
line
of
penetration
as
bare
of
sustenance
as
this
if
we
assume
the
existence
of
the
barrier
an
impassable
line
of
fortifications
encountered
within
many
marches
of
the
frontier
we
may
also
assume
that
starvation
will
be
the
overwhelming
force
that
will
cut
off
the
french
the
other
s
keen
eyes
flickered
for
a
moment
his
face
lost
its
assurance
and
it
was
samoval
s
turn
to
smile
but
the
major
made
a
sharp
recovery
he
slowly
shook
his
head
you
have
no
right
to
assume
an
impassable
barrier
that
is
an
inadmissible
hypothesis
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
line
of
fortifications
impassable
to
the
you
will
pardon
me
major
but
it
is
yourself
have
no
right
to
your
own
assumptions
again
you
overlook
something
i
will
grant
that
technically
what
you
say
is
true
no
fortifications
can
be
built
that
can
not
be
destroyed
given
adequate
power
with
which
it
is
yet
to
prove
that
massena
not
knowing
what
may
await
him
will
be
equipped
but
let
us
for
a
moment
take
so
much
for
granted
and
now
consider
this
fortifications
are
unquestionably
building
in
the
region
of
torres
vedras
and
wellington
guards
the
secret
so
jealously
that
not
even
the
british
either
here
or
in
england
are
aware
of
their
nature
that
is
why
the
cabinet
in
london
takes
for
granted
an
embarkation
in
september
wellington
has
not
even
taken
his
government
into
his
confidence
that
is
the
sort
of
man
he
is
now
these
fortifications
have
been
building
since
last
october
best
part
of
eight
months
have
already
gone
in
their
construction
it
may
be
another
two
or
three
months
before
the
french
army
reaches
them
i
do
not
say
that
the
french
can
not
pass
them
given
time
but
how
long
will
it
take
the
french
to
pull
down
what
it
will
have
taken
ten
or
eleven
months
to
construct
and
if
they
are
unable
to
draw
sustenance
from
a
desolate
wasted
country
what
time
will
they
have
at
their
disposal
it
will
be
with
them
a
matter
of
life
or
death
having
come
so
far
they
must
reach
lisbon
or
perish
and
if
the
fortifications
can
delay
them
by
a
single
month
then
granted
that
all
lord
wellington
s
other
dispositions
have
been
duly
carried
out
perish
they
must
it
remains
monsieur
le
major
for
you
to
determine
whether
with
all
their
energy
with
all
their
genius
and
all
their
valour
the
french
can
in
an
condition
destroy
in
a
few
weeks
the
considered
labour
of
nearly
a
the
major
was
aghast
he
had
changed
colour
and
through
his
eyes
wide
and
staring
his
stupefaction
glared
forth
at
them
minas
uttered
a
dry
cough
under
cover
of
his
hand
and
screwed
up
his
eyeglass
to
regard
the
major
more
attentively
you
do
not
appear
to
have
considered
all
that
he
said
but
my
dear
marquis
was
the
answer
why
was
i
not
told
all
this
to
begin
with
you
represented
yourself
as
but
indifferently
informed
monsieur
de
samoval
whereas
so
i
am
my
dear
major
as
far
as
information
goes
if
i
did
not
use
these
arguments
before
it
was
because
it
seemed
to
me
an
impertinence
to
offer
what
after
all
are
no
more
than
the
conclusions
of
my
own
constructive
and
deductive
reasoning
to
one
so
well
versed
in
strategy
as
the
major
was
silenced
for
a
moment
i
congratulate
you
count
he
said
monsieur
le
marechal
shall
have
your
views
without
delay
tell
me
he
begged
you
say
these
fortifications
lie
in
the
region
of
torres
vedras
can
you
be
more
precise
i
think
so
but
again
i
warn
you
that
i
can
tell
you
only
what
i
infer
i
judge
they
will
run
from
the
sea
somewhere
near
the
mouth
of
the
zizandre
in
a
semicircle
to
the
tagus
somewhere
to
the
south
of
santarem
i
know
that
they
do
not
reach
as
far
north
as
san
because
the
roads
there
are
open
whereas
all
roads
to
the
south
where
i
am
assuming
that
the
fortifications
lie
are
closed
and
closely
why
do
you
suggest
a
semicircle
because
that
is
the
formation
of
the
hills
and
presumably
the
line
of
heights
would
be
yes
the
major
approved
slowly
and
the
distance
then
would
be
some
thirty
or
forty
miles
the
major
s
face
relaxed
its
gravity
he
even
smiled
you
will
agree
count
that
in
a
line
of
that
extent
a
uniform
strength
is
out
of
the
question
it
must
perforce
present
many
weak
many
vulnerable
oh
plans
of
these
lines
must
be
in
again
undoubtedly
sir
terence
o
moy
will
have
plans
in
his
possession
showing
their
projected
extent
colonel
fletcher
who
is
in
charge
of
the
construction
is
in
constant
communication
with
the
adjutant
himself
an
engineer
and
as
i
partly
imagine
partly
infer
from
odd
phrases
that
i
have
overheard
especially
entrusted
by
lord
wellington
with
the
supervision
of
the
two
things
then
are
necessary
said
the
major
promptly
the
first
is
that
the
devastation
of
the
country
should
be
retarded
and
as
far
as
possible
hindered
that
said
minas
you
may
safely
leave
to
myself
and
souza
s
other
friends
the
northern
noblemen
who
have
no
intention
of
becoming
the
victims
of
british
disinclination
to
pitched
the
second
and
this
is
more
difficult
is
that
we
should
obtain
by
hook
or
by
crook
a
plan
of
the
and
he
looked
directly
at
samoval
the
count
nodded
slowly
but
his
face
expressed
doubt
i
am
quite
alive
to
the
necessity
i
always
have
been
but
to
a
man
of
your
resource
and
intelligence
an
intelligence
of
which
you
have
just
given
such
very
signal
proof
the
matter
should
be
he
paused
a
moment
then
if
i
understand
you
correctly
monsieur
de
samoval
your
fortunes
have
suffered
deeply
and
you
are
almost
ruined
by
this
policy
of
wellington
s
you
are
offered
the
opportunity
of
making
a
magnificent
recovery
the
emperor
is
the
most
generous
paymaster
in
the
world
and
he
is
beyond
measure
impatient
at
the
manner
in
which
the
campaign
in
the
peninsula
is
dragging
on
he
has
spoken
of
it
as
an
ulcer
that
is
draining
the
empire
of
its
resources
for
the
man
who
could
render
him
the
service
of
disclosing
the
weak
spot
in
this
armour
the
achilles
heel
of
the
british
there
would
be
a
reward
beyond
all
your
possible
dreams
obtain
the
plans
then
and
he
checked
abruptly
the
door
had
opened
and
in
a
venetian
mirror
facing
him
upon
the
wall
the
major
caught
the
reflection
of
a
british
uniform
the
stiff
gold
collar
surmounted
by
a
bronzed
hawk
face
with
which
he
was
acquainted
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
said
the
officer
in
portuguese
i
was
looking
for
his
voice
became
indistinct
so
that
they
never
knew
who
it
was
that
he
had
been
seeking
when
he
intruded
upon
their
privacy
the
door
had
closed
again
and
the
reflection
had
vanished
from
the
mirror
but
there
were
beads
of
perspiration
on
the
major
s
brow
it
is
fortunate
he
muttered
breathlessly
that
my
back
was
towards
him
i
would
as
soon
meet
the
devil
face
to
face
i
didn
t
dream
he
was
in
who
is
he
asked
minas
colonel
grant
the
british
intelligence
officer
phew
name
of
a
name
what
an
escape
the
major
mopped
his
brow
with
a
silk
handkerchief
beware
of
him
monsieur
de
he
rose
he
was
obviously
shaken
by
the
meeting
if
one
of
you
will
kindly
make
quite
sure
that
he
is
not
about
i
think
that
i
had
better
go
if
we
should
meet
everything
might
be
then
with
a
change
of
manner
he
stayed
samoval
who
was
already
on
his
way
to
the
door
we
understand
each
other
then
he
questioned
them
i
have
my
papers
and
at
dawn
i
leave
lisbon
i
shall
report
your
conclusions
to
the
prince
and
in
anticipation
i
may
already
offer
you
the
expression
of
his
profoundest
gratitude
meanwhile
you
know
what
is
to
do
opposition
to
the
policy
and
the
plans
of
the
fortifications
above
all
the
he
shook
hands
with
them
and
having
waited
until
samoval
assured
him
that
the
corridor
outside
was
clear
he
took
his
departure
and
was
soon
afterwards
driving
home
congratulating
himself
upon
his
most
fortunate
escape
from
the
hawk
eye
of
colquhoun
grant
but
when
in
the
dead
of
that
night
he
was
awakened
to
find
a
british
sergeant
with
a
halbert
and
six
redcoats
with
fixed
bayonets
surrounding
his
bed
it
occurred
to
him
belatedly
that
what
one
man
can
see
in
a
mirror
is
also
visible
to
another
and
that
marshal
massena
prince
of
esslingen
waiting
for
information
beyond
ciudad
rodrigo
would
never
enjoy
the
advantages
of
a
report
of
count
samoval
s
masterly
constructive
and
deductive
reasoning
chapter
ix
the
general
order
sir
terence
sat
alone
in
his
spacious
severely
furnished
private
room
in
the
official
quarters
at
monsanto
on
the
broad
carved
before
him
there
was
a
mass
of
documents
relating
to
the
clothing
and
accoutrement
of
the
forces
to
leaves
of
absence
to
staff
appointments
there
were
returns
from
the
various
divisions
of
the
sick
and
wounded
in
hospital
from
which
a
complete
list
was
to
be
prepared
for
the
secretary
of
state
for
war
at
home
there
were
plans
of
the
lines
at
torres
vedras
just
received
indicating
the
progress
of
the
works
at
various
points
and
there
were
documents
and
communications
of
all
kinds
concerned
with
the
s
multifarious
and
arduous
duties
including
an
urgent
letter
from
colonel
fletcher
suggesting
that
the
should
take
an
early
opportunity
of
inspecting
in
person
the
inner
lines
of
fortification
sir
terence
however
sat
back
in
his
chair
his
work
neglected
his
eyes
dreamily
gazing
through
the
open
window
but
seeing
nothing
of
the
landscape
beyond
a
heavy
frown
darkening
his
bronzed
and
rugged
face
his
mind
was
very
far
from
his
official
duties
and
the
mass
of
reminders
before
him
this
augean
stable
of
arrears
he
was
lost
in
thought
of
his
wife
and
tremayne
five
days
had
elapsed
since
the
ball
at
count
redondo
s
where
sir
terence
had
surprised
the
pair
together
in
the
garden
and
his
suspicions
had
been
fired
by
the
compromising
attitude
in
which
he
had
discovered
them
tremayne
s
frank
easy
bearing
so
unassociable
with
guilt
had
as
we
know
gone
far
to
reassure
him
and
had
even
shamed
him
so
that
he
had
trampled
his
suspicions
underfoot
but
other
things
had
happened
since
to
revive
his
bitter
doubts
daily
constantly
had
he
been
coming
upon
tremayne
and
lady
o
moy
alone
together
in
intimate
confidential
talk
which
was
ever
silenced
on
his
approach
the
two
had
taken
to
wandering
by
themselves
in
the
gardens
at
all
hours
a
thing
that
had
never
been
so
before
and
o
moy
detected
or
imagined
that
he
detected
a
closer
intimacy
between
them
a
greater
warmth
towards
the
captain
on
the
part
of
her
ladyship
thus
matters
had
reached
a
pass
in
which
peace
of
mind
was
impossible
to
him
it
was
not
merely
what
he
saw
it
was
his
knowledge
of
what
was
it
was
his
consciousness
of
his
own
age
and
his
wife
s
youth
it
was
the
memory
of
his
jealousy
of
tremayne
which
had
been
awakened
by
the
gossip
of
those
days
a
gossip
that
pronounced
tremayne
una
butler
s
poor
suitor
too
poor
either
to
declare
himself
or
to
be
accepted
if
he
did
the
old
wound
which
that
gossip
had
dealt
him
then
was
reopened
now
he
thought
of
tremayne
s
manifest
concern
for
una
he
remembered
how
in
that
very
room
some
six
weeks
ago
when
butler
s
escapade
had
first
been
heard
of
it
was
from
avowed
concern
for
una
that
tremayne
had
urged
him
to
befriend
and
rescue
his
rascally
he
remembered
too
with
increasing
bitterness
that
it
was
una
herself
had
induced
him
to
appoint
tremayne
to
his
staff
there
were
moments
when
the
conviction
of
tremayne
s
honesty
the
thought
of
tremayne
s
unswerving
friendship
for
himself
would
surge
up
to
combat
and
abate
the
fires
of
his
devastating
jealousy
but
evidence
would
kindle
those
fires
anew
until
they
flamed
up
to
scorch
his
soul
with
shame
and
anger
he
had
been
a
fool
in
that
he
had
married
a
woman
of
half
his
years
a
fool
in
that
he
had
suffered
her
former
lover
to
be
thrown
into
close
association
with
her
thus
he
assured
himself
but
he
would
abide
by
his
folly
and
so
must
she
and
he
would
see
to
it
that
whatever
fruits
that
folly
yielded
dishonour
should
not
be
one
of
them
through
all
his
darkening
rage
there
beat
the
light
of
reason
to
avert
he
bethought
him
was
better
than
to
avenge
nor
were
such
stains
to
be
wiped
out
by
vengeance
a
cuckold
remains
a
cuckold
though
he
take
the
life
of
the
man
who
has
reduced
him
to
that
ignominy
tremayne
must
go
before
the
evil
transcended
reparation
let
him
return
to
his
regiment
and
do
his
work
of
sapping
and
mining
elsewhere
than
in
o
moy
s
household
eased
by
that
resolve
he
rose
a
tall
martial
figure
youth
and
energy
in
every
line
of
it
for
all
his
six
and
forty
years
awhile
he
paced
the
room
in
thought
then
suddenly
with
hands
clenched
behind
his
back
he
checked
by
the
window
checked
on
a
horrible
question
that
had
flashed
upon
his
tortured
mind
what
if
already
the
evil
should
be
irreparable
what
proof
had
he
that
it
was
not
so
the
door
opened
and
tremayne
himself
came
in
quickly
here
s
the
very
devil
to
pay
sir
he
announced
with
that
odd
mixture
of
familiarity
towards
his
friend
and
deference
to
his
chief
o
moy
looked
at
him
in
silence
with
smouldering
questioning
eyes
thinking
of
anything
but
the
trouble
which
the
captain
s
air
and
manner
heralded
captain
stanhope
has
just
arrived
from
headquarters
with
messages
for
you
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
sir
the
dispatches
from
home
by
the
thunderbolt
which
we
forwarded
from
here
three
weeks
ago
reached
lord
wellington
only
the
day
before
sir
terence
became
instantly
alert
garfield
who
carried
them
came
into
collision
at
penalva
with
an
officer
of
anson
s
brigade
there
was
a
meeting
and
garfield
was
shot
through
the
lung
he
lay
between
life
and
death
for
a
fortnight
with
the
result
that
the
dispatches
were
delayed
until
he
recovered
sufficiently
to
remember
them
and
to
have
them
forwarded
by
other
hands
but
you
had
better
see
stanhope
the
came
in
he
was
splashed
from
head
to
foot
in
witness
of
the
fury
with
which
he
had
ridden
his
hair
was
caked
with
dust
and
his
face
haggard
but
he
carried
himself
with
soldierly
uprightness
and
his
speech
was
brisk
he
repeated
what
tremayne
had
already
stated
with
some
few
additional
details
this
wretched
fellow
sent
lord
wellington
a
letter
dictated
from
his
bed
in
which
he
swore
that
the
duel
was
forced
upon
him
and
that
his
honour
allowed
him
no
alternative
i
don
t
think
any
feature
of
the
case
has
so
deeply
angered
lord
wellington
as
this
stupid
plea
he
mentioned
that
when
sir
john
moore
was
at
herrerias
in
the
course
of
his
retreat
upon
corunna
he
sent
forward
instructions
for
the
leading
division
to
halt
at
lugo
where
he
designed
to
deliver
battle
if
the
enemy
would
accept
it
that
dispatch
was
carried
to
sir
david
baird
by
one
of
sir
john
s
aides
but
sir
david
forwarded
it
by
the
hand
of
a
trooper
who
got
drunk
and
lost
it
that
says
lord
wellington
is
the
only
parallel
so
far
as
he
is
aware
of
the
present
case
with
this
difference
that
whilst
a
common
trooper
might
so
far
fail
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
his
mission
no
such
lack
of
appreciation
can
excuse
captain
i
am
glad
of
that
said
sir
terence
who
had
been
bristling
for
a
moment
i
imagined
that
it
was
to
be
implied
i
had
been
as
indiscreet
in
my
choice
of
a
messenger
as
sir
david
no
no
sir
terence
i
merely
repeated
lord
wellington
s
words
that
you
may
realise
how
deeply
angered
he
is
if
garfield
recovers
from
his
wound
he
will
be
tried
by
he
is
under
open
arrest
meanwhile
as
is
his
opponent
in
the
duel
a
major
sykes
of
the
dragoons
that
they
will
both
be
broke
is
beyond
doubt
but
that
is
not
all
this
affair
which
might
have
had
such
grave
consequences
coming
so
soon
upon
the
heels
of
major
berkeley
s
business
has
driven
lord
wellington
to
a
step
regarding
which
this
letter
will
instruct
sir
terence
broke
the
seal
the
letter
penned
by
a
secretary
but
bearing
wellington
s
own
signature
ran
as
follows
the
bearer
captain
stanhope
will
inform
you
of
the
particulars
of
this
disgraceful
business
of
captain
garfield
s
the
affair
following
so
soon
upon
that
of
major
berkeley
has
determined
me
to
make
it
clearly
understood
to
the
officers
in
his
majesty
s
service
that
they
have
been
sent
to
the
peninsula
to
fight
the
french
and
not
each
other
or
members
of
the
civilian
population
while
this
campaign
continues
and
as
long
as
i
am
in
charge
of
it
i
am
determined
not
to
suffer
upon
any
plea
whatever
the
abominable
practice
of
duelling
among
those
under
my
command
i
desire
you
to
publish
this
immediately
in
general
orders
enjoining
upon
officers
of
all
ranks
without
exception
the
necessity
to
postpone
the
settlement
of
private
quarrels
at
least
until
the
close
of
this
campaign
and
to
add
force
to
this
injunction
you
will
make
it
known
that
any
infringement
of
this
order
will
be
considered
as
a
capital
offence
that
any
officer
hereafter
either
sending
or
accepting
a
challenge
will
if
found
guilty
by
a
general
be
immediately
sir
terence
nodded
slowly
very
well
he
said
the
measure
is
most
wise
although
i
doubt
if
it
will
be
popular
but
then
unpopularity
is
the
fate
of
wise
measures
i
am
glad
the
matter
has
not
ended
more
seriously
the
dispatches
in
question
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
were
not
of
great
there
is
something
more
said
captain
stanhope
the
dispatches
bore
signs
of
having
been
tampered
tampered
with
it
was
a
question
from
tremayne
charged
with
incredulity
but
who
would
have
tampered
with
them
there
were
signs
that
is
all
garfield
was
taken
to
the
house
of
the
parish
priest
where
he
lay
lost
until
he
recovered
sufficiently
to
realise
his
position
for
himself
no
doubt
you
will
have
a
schedule
of
the
contents
of
the
dispatch
sir
terence
certainly
it
is
in
your
possession
i
think
tremayne
turned
to
his
desk
and
a
brief
search
in
one
of
its
drawers
brought
to
light
an
oblong
strip
of
paper
folded
and
endorsed
he
unfolded
and
spread
it
on
sir
terence
s
table
whilst
captain
stanhope
producing
a
note
with
which
he
came
equipped
stooped
to
check
off
the
items
suddenly
he
stopped
frowned
and
finally
placed
his
finger
under
one
of
the
lines
of
tremayne
s
schedule
carefully
studying
his
own
note
for
a
moment
ha
he
said
quietly
at
last
what
s
this
and
he
read
note
from
lord
liverpool
of
reinforcements
to
be
embarked
for
lisbon
in
june
or
he
looked
at
the
adjutant
and
the
adjutant
s
secretary
that
would
appear
to
be
the
most
important
document
of
all
indeed
the
only
document
of
any
vital
importance
and
it
was
not
included
in
the
dispatch
as
it
reached
lord
the
three
looked
gravely
at
one
another
in
silence
have
you
a
copy
of
the
note
sir
inquired
the
not
a
copy
but
a
summary
of
its
contents
the
figures
it
contained
are
pencilled
there
on
the
margin
tremayne
answered
allow
me
sir
said
stanhope
and
taking
up
a
quill
from
the
adjutant
s
table
he
rapidly
copied
the
figures
lord
wellington
must
have
this
memorandum
as
soon
as
possible
the
rest
sir
terence
is
of
course
a
matter
for
yourself
you
will
know
what
to
do
meanwhile
i
shall
report
to
his
lordship
what
has
occurred
i
had
best
set
out
at
if
you
will
rest
for
an
hour
and
give
my
wife
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
luncheon
i
shall
have
a
letter
ready
for
lord
wellington
replied
sir
terence
perhaps
you
ll
see
to
it
tremayne
he
added
without
waiting
for
captain
stanhope
s
answer
to
an
invitation
which
amounted
to
a
command
thus
stanhope
was
led
away
and
sir
terence
all
other
matters
forgotten
for
the
moment
sat
down
to
write
his
letter
later
in
the
day
after
captain
stanhope
had
taken
his
departure
the
duty
fell
to
tremayne
of
framing
the
general
order
and
seeing
to
the
dispatch
of
a
copy
to
each
division
i
wonder
he
said
to
sir
terence
who
will
be
the
first
to
break
it
why
the
fool
who
s
most
anxious
to
be
broke
himself
answered
sir
terence
there
appeared
to
be
reservations
about
it
in
tremayne
s
mind
it
s
a
devilish
stringent
regulation
he
criticised
but
very
salutary
and
very
oh
tremayne
s
agreement
was
unhesitating
but
i
shouldn
t
care
to
feel
the
restraint
of
it
and
i
thank
heaven
i
have
no
enemy
thirsting
for
my
sir
terence
s
brow
darkened
his
face
was
turned
away
from
his
secretary
how
can
a
man
be
confident
of
that
he
wondered
oh
a
clean
conscience
i
suppose
laughed
tremayne
and
he
gave
his
attention
to
his
papers
frankness
honesty
and
rang
so
clear
in
the
words
that
they
sowed
in
sir
terence
s
mind
fresh
doubts
of
the
galling
suspicion
he
had
been
harbouring
do
you
boast
a
clean
conscience
eh
ned
he
asked
not
without
a
lurking
shame
at
this
deliberate
sly
searching
of
the
other
s
mind
yet
he
strained
his
ears
for
the
answer
almost
clean
said
tremayne
temptation
doesn
t
stain
when
it
s
resisted
does
it
sir
terence
trembled
but
he
controlled
himself
nay
now
that
s
a
question
for
the
casuists
they
right
answer
you
that
it
depends
upon
the
and
he
asked
what
s
tempting
you
tremayne
was
in
a
mood
for
confidences
and
sir
terence
was
his
friend
but
he
hesitated
his
answer
to
the
question
was
an
irrelevance
it
s
just
hell
to
be
poor
o
moy
he
said
the
adjutant
turned
to
stare
at
him
tremayne
was
sitting
with
his
head
resting
on
one
hand
the
fingers
thrusting
through
the
crisp
fair
hair
and
there
was
gloom
in
his
face
a
dullness
in
the
usually
keen
grey
eyes
is
there
anything
on
your
mind
quoth
sir
terence
temptation
was
the
answer
it
s
an
unpleasant
thing
to
struggle
but
you
spoke
of
poverty
to
be
sure
if
i
weren
t
poor
i
could
put
my
fortunes
to
the
test
and
make
an
end
of
the
matter
one
way
or
the
there
was
a
pause
sure
i
hope
i
am
the
last
man
to
force
a
confidence
ned
said
o
moy
but
you
certainly
seem
as
if
it
would
do
you
good
to
tremayne
shook
himself
mentally
i
think
we
had
better
deal
with
the
matter
of
this
dispatch
that
was
tampered
with
at
so
we
will
to
be
sure
but
it
can
wait
a
sir
terence
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
he
crossed
slowly
to
his
secretary
s
side
what
s
on
your
mind
ned
he
asked
with
abrupt
solicitude
and
ned
could
not
suspect
that
it
was
the
matter
on
sir
terence
s
own
mind
that
was
urging
him
but
urging
him
hopefully
captain
tremayne
looked
up
with
a
rueful
smile
i
thought
you
boasted
that
you
never
forced
a
and
then
he
looked
away
sylvia
armytage
tells
me
that
she
is
thinking
of
returning
to
for
a
moment
the
words
seemed
to
sir
terence
a
fresh
irrelevance
another
attempt
to
change
the
subject
then
quite
suddenly
a
light
broke
upon
his
mind
shedding
a
relief
so
great
and
joyous
that
he
sought
to
check
it
almost
in
fear
it
is
more
than
she
has
told
me
he
answered
steadily
but
then
no
doubt
you
enjoy
her
tremayne
flashed
him
a
wry
glance
and
looked
away
again
alas
he
said
and
fetched
a
sigh
and
is
sylvia
the
temptation
ned
tremayne
was
silent
for
a
while
little
dreaming
how
sir
terence
hung
upon
his
answer
how
impatiently
he
awaited
it
of
course
he
said
at
last
isn
t
it
obvious
to
any
one
and
he
grew
rhapsodical
how
can
a
man
be
daily
in
her
company
without
succumbing
to
her
loveliness
to
her
matchless
grace
of
body
and
of
mind
without
perceiving
that
she
is
incomparable
peerless
as
much
above
other
women
as
an
angel
perhaps
might
be
above
herself
before
his
glum
solemnity
and
before
something
else
that
tremayne
could
not
suspect
sir
terence
exploded
into
laughter
of
the
immense
and
joyous
relief
in
it
his
secretary
caught
no
hint
all
he
heard
was
its
sheer
amusement
and
this
galled
and
shamed
him
for
no
man
cares
to
be
laughed
at
for
such
feelings
as
tremayne
had
been
led
into
betraying
you
think
it
something
to
laugh
at
he
said
tartly
laugh
is
it
spluttered
sir
terence
god
grant
i
don
t
burst
a
tremayne
reddened
when
you
ve
indulged
your
humour
sir
he
said
stiffly
perhaps
you
ll
consider
the
matter
of
this
but
sir
terence
laughed
more
uproariously
than
ever
he
came
to
stand
beside
tremayne
and
slapped
him
heartily
on
the
shoulder
ye
ll
kill
me
ned
he
protested
for
god
s
sake
not
so
glum
it
s
that
makes
ye
i
am
sorry
you
find
me
nay
then
it
s
glad
ye
ought
to
be
by
my
soul
if
sylvia
tempts
you
man
why
the
devil
don
t
ye
just
succumb
and
have
done
with
it
she
s
handsome
enough
and
well
set
up
with
her
air
of
an
amazon
and
she
rides
uncommon
straight
begad
indeed
it
s
a
broth
of
a
girl
she
is
in
the
the
ballroom
or
at
the
although
riper
acquaintance
may
discover
her
not
to
be
quite
all
that
you
imagine
her
at
present
let
your
temptation
lead
you
then
entirely
and
good
luck
to
you
my
didn
t
i
tell
you
o
moy
answered
the
captain
mollified
a
little
by
the
sympathy
and
good
feeling
peeping
through
the
adjutant
s
boisterousness
that
poverty
is
just
hell
it
s
my
poverty
that
s
in
the
and
is
that
all
then
it
s
thankful
you
should
be
that
sylvia
armytage
has
got
enough
for
that
s
just
just
what
the
obstacle
i
could
marry
a
poor
woman
but
sylvia
have
you
spoken
to
her
tremayne
was
indignant
how
do
you
suppose
i
could
it
ll
not
have
occurred
to
you
that
the
lady
may
have
feelings
which
having
aroused
you
ought
to
be
considering
a
wry
smile
and
a
shake
of
the
head
was
tremayne
s
only
answer
and
then
carruthers
came
in
fresh
from
lisbon
where
he
had
been
upon
business
connected
with
the
commissariat
and
to
tremayne
s
relief
the
subject
was
perforce
abandoned
yet
he
marvelled
several
times
that
day
that
the
hilarity
he
should
have
awakened
in
sir
terence
continued
to
cling
to
the
adjutant
and
that
despite
the
many
vexatious
matters
claiming
attention
he
should
preserve
an
irrepressible
and
almost
boyish
gaiety
meanwhile
however
the
coming
of
carruthers
had
brought
the
adjutant
a
moment
s
seriousness
and
he
reverted
to
the
business
of
captain
garfield
when
he
had
mentioned
the
missing
note
carruthers
very
properly
became
grave
he
was
a
short
stiffly
built
man
with
a
round
rather
florid
face
the
matter
must
be
probed
at
once
sir
he
ventured
we
know
that
we
move
in
a
tangle
of
intrigues
and
espionage
but
such
a
thing
as
this
has
never
happened
before
have
you
anything
to
go
upon
captain
stanhope
gave
us
nothing
said
the
adjutant
it
would
be
best
perhaps
to
get
grant
to
look
into
it
said
tremayne
if
he
is
still
in
lisbon
said
sir
terence
i
passed
him
in
the
street
an
hour
ago
replied
carruthers
then
by
all
means
let
a
note
be
sent
to
him
asking
him
if
he
will
step
up
to
monsanto
as
soon
as
he
conveniently
can
you
might
see
to
it
chapter
x
the
stifled
quarrel
it
was
noon
of
the
next
day
before
colonel
grant
came
to
the
house
at
monsanto
from
whose
balcony
floated
the
british
flag
and
before
whose
portals
stood
a
sentry
in
the
tall
bearskin
of
the
grenadiers
he
found
the
adjutant
alone
in
his
room
and
apologised
for
the
delay
in
responding
to
his
invitation
pleading
the
urgency
of
other
matters
that
he
had
in
hand
a
wise
enactment
this
of
lord
wellington
s
was
his
next
comment
i
mean
this
prohibition
of
duelling
it
may
be
resented
by
some
of
our
young
bloods
as
an
unwarrantable
interference
with
their
privileges
but
it
will
do
a
deal
of
good
and
no
one
can
deny
that
there
is
ample
cause
for
the
it
is
on
the
subject
of
the
cause
that
i
m
wanting
to
consult
you
said
sir
terence
offering
his
visitor
a
chair
have
you
been
informed
of
the
details
no
let
me
give
you
and
he
related
how
the
dispatch
bore
signs
of
having
been
tampered
with
and
how
the
only
document
of
any
real
importance
came
to
be
missing
from
it
colonel
grant
sitting
with
his
sabre
across
his
knees
listened
gravely
and
thoughtfully
in
the
end
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
keen
hawk
face
unmoved
the
harm
is
done
and
can
not
very
well
be
repaired
the
information
obtained
no
doubt
on
behalf
of
massena
will
by
now
be
on
its
way
to
him
let
us
be
thankful
that
the
matter
is
not
more
grave
and
thankful
too
that
you
were
able
to
supply
a
copy
of
lord
liverpool
s
figures
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
take
steps
to
discover
the
spy
whose
existence
is
disclosed
by
this
colquhoun
grant
smiled
that
is
precisely
the
matter
which
has
brought
me
to
how
sir
terence
was
amazed
you
knew
oh
not
that
this
had
happened
but
that
the
spy
or
rather
a
network
of
espionage
existed
we
move
here
in
a
web
of
intrigue
wrought
by
vindictiveness
and
every
form
of
malice
whilst
the
great
bulk
of
the
portuguese
people
and
their
leaders
are
loyally
with
us
there
is
a
strong
party
opposing
us
which
would
prefer
even
to
see
the
french
prevail
of
course
you
are
aware
of
this
the
heart
and
brain
of
all
this
is
as
i
gather
the
principal
souza
wellington
has
compelled
his
retirement
from
the
government
but
if
by
doing
so
he
has
restricted
the
man
s
power
for
evil
he
has
certainly
increased
his
will
for
evil
and
his
activities
you
tell
me
that
garfield
was
cared
for
by
the
parish
priest
at
penalva
there
you
are
half
the
priesthood
of
the
country
are
on
souza
s
side
since
the
patriarch
of
lisbon
himself
is
little
more
than
a
tool
of
souza
s
what
happens
this
priest
discovers
that
the
british
officer
whom
he
has
so
charitably
put
to
bed
in
his
house
is
the
bearer
of
dispatches
a
loyal
man
would
instantly
have
communicated
with
marshal
beresford
at
thomar
this
fellow
instead
advises
the
intriguers
in
lisbon
the
captain
s
dispatches
are
examined
and
the
only
document
of
real
value
is
abstracted
of
course
it
would
be
difficult
to
establish
a
case
against
the
priest
and
it
is
always
vexatious
and
troublesome
to
have
dealings
with
that
class
as
it
generally
means
trouble
with
the
peasantry
but
the
case
is
as
clear
as
but
the
intriguers
here
can
you
not
deal
with
them
i
have
them
under
observation
replied
the
colonel
i
already
knew
the
leaders
souza
s
lieutenants
in
lisbon
and
i
can
put
my
hand
upon
them
at
any
moment
if
i
have
not
already
done
so
it
is
because
i
find
it
more
profitable
to
leave
them
at
large
it
is
possible
indeed
that
i
may
never
proceed
to
extremes
against
them
conceive
that
they
have
enabled
me
to
seize
la
fleche
the
most
dangerous
insidious
and
skilful
of
all
napoleon
s
agents
i
found
him
at
redondo
s
ball
last
week
in
the
uniform
of
a
portuguese
major
and
through
him
i
was
able
to
track
down
souza
s
chief
instrument
i
discovered
them
closeted
with
him
in
one
of
the
and
you
didn
t
arrest
them
arrest
them
i
apologised
for
my
intrusion
and
withdrew
la
fleche
took
his
leave
of
them
he
was
to
have
left
lisbon
at
dawn
equipped
with
a
passport
countersigned
by
yourself
my
dear
what
s
that
a
passport
for
major
vieira
of
the
portuguese
cacadores
do
you
remember
it
major
vieira
sir
terence
frowned
thoughtfully
suddenly
he
recollected
but
that
was
countersigned
by
me
at
the
request
of
count
samoval
who
represented
himself
a
personal
friend
of
the
major
so
indeed
he
is
but
the
major
in
question
was
la
fleche
and
samoval
knew
this
sir
terence
was
incredulous
colonel
grant
did
not
immediately
answer
the
question
he
preferred
to
continue
his
narrative
that
night
i
had
the
false
major
arrested
very
quietly
i
have
caused
him
to
disappear
for
the
present
his
lisbon
friends
believe
him
to
be
on
his
way
to
massena
with
the
information
they
no
doubt
supplied
him
massena
awaits
his
return
at
salamanca
and
will
continue
to
wait
thus
when
he
fails
to
be
seen
or
heard
of
there
will
be
a
good
deal
of
mystification
on
all
sides
which
is
the
proper
state
of
mind
in
which
to
place
your
opponents
lord
liverpool
s
figures
let
me
add
were
not
among
the
interesting
notes
found
upon
him
possibly
because
at
that
date
they
had
not
yet
been
and
you
say
that
samoval
was
aware
of
the
man
s
real
identity
insisted
sir
terence
still
incredulous
aware
of
it
colonel
grant
laughed
shortly
samoval
is
souza
s
principal
agent
the
most
dangerous
man
in
lisbon
and
the
most
subtle
his
sympathies
are
french
through
and
sir
terence
stared
at
him
in
frank
amazement
in
utter
unbelief
oh
impossible
he
ejaculated
at
last
i
saw
samoval
for
the
first
time
said
colonel
grant
by
way
of
answer
in
oporto
at
the
time
of
soult
s
occupation
he
did
not
call
himself
samoval
just
then
any
more
than
i
called
myself
colquhoun
grant
he
was
very
active
there
in
the
french
interest
i
should
indeed
be
more
precise
and
say
in
bonaparte
s
interest
for
he
was
the
man
instrumental
in
disclosing
to
soult
the
bourbon
conspiracy
which
was
undermining
the
marshal
s
army
you
do
not
know
perhaps
that
french
sympathy
runs
in
samoval
s
family
you
may
not
be
aware
that
the
portuguese
marquis
of
alorna
who
holds
a
command
in
the
emperor
s
army
and
is
at
present
with
massena
at
salamanca
is
samoval
s
but
faltered
sir
terence
count
samoval
has
been
a
regular
visitor
here
for
the
past
three
so
i
understand
said
grant
coolly
if
i
had
known
of
it
before
i
should
have
warned
you
but
as
you
are
aware
i
have
been
in
spain
on
other
business
you
realise
the
danger
of
having
such
a
man
about
the
place
scraps
of
information
oh
as
to
that
sir
terence
interrupted
i
can
assure
you
that
none
have
fallen
from
my
official
never
be
too
sure
sir
terence
matters
here
must
ever
be
under
discussion
there
are
your
secretaries
and
the
ladies
and
samoval
has
a
great
way
with
the
women
what
they
know
you
may
wager
that
he
they
know
that
is
a
great
deal
to
say
little
odds
and
ends
now
a
hint
at
one
time
a
word
dropped
at
another
these
things
picked
up
naturally
by
feminine
curiosity
and
retailed
thoughtlessly
under
samoval
s
charming
suasion
and
display
of
britannic
sympathies
and
samoval
has
the
devil
s
own
talent
for
bringing
together
the
pieces
of
a
puzzle
take
the
lines
now
you
may
have
parted
with
no
details
but
mention
of
them
will
surely
have
been
made
in
this
household
however
he
broke
off
abruptly
that
is
all
past
and
done
with
i
am
as
sure
as
you
are
that
any
real
indiscretions
in
this
household
are
unimaginable
and
so
we
may
be
confident
that
no
harm
has
yet
been
done
but
you
will
gather
from
what
i
have
now
told
you
that
samoval
s
visits
here
are
not
a
mere
social
waste
of
time
that
he
comes
acquires
familiarity
and
makes
himself
the
friend
of
the
family
with
a
very
definite
aim
in
he
does
not
come
again
said
sir
terence
rising
that
is
more
than
i
should
have
ventured
to
suggest
but
it
is
a
very
wise
resolve
it
will
need
tact
to
carry
it
out
for
samoval
is
a
man
to
be
handled
i
ll
handle
him
carefully
devil
a
fear
said
sir
terence
you
can
depend
upon
my
colonel
grant
rose
in
this
matter
of
penalva
i
will
consider
further
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
to
be
done
now
the
main
thing
is
to
stop
up
the
outlets
through
which
information
reaches
the
french
and
that
is
my
chief
concern
how
is
the
stripping
of
the
country
proceeding
now
it
was
more
active
immediately
after
souza
left
the
government
but
the
last
reports
announce
a
slackening
they
are
at
work
in
that
too
you
see
souza
will
not
slumber
while
there
s
vengeance
and
to
keep
him
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
take
his
leave
you
ll
stay
to
luncheon
said
sir
terence
it
is
about
to
be
you
are
very
kind
sir
they
descended
to
find
luncheon
served
already
in
the
open
under
the
trellis
vine
and
the
party
consisted
of
lady
o
moy
miss
armytage
captain
tremayne
major
carruthers
and
count
samoval
of
whose
presence
this
was
the
adjutant
s
first
intimation
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
count
had
been
at
monsanto
for
the
past
hour
the
first
half
of
which
he
had
spent
most
agreeably
on
the
terrace
with
the
ladies
he
had
spoken
so
eulogistically
of
the
genius
of
lord
wellington
and
the
valour
of
the
british
soldier
and
the
irish
soldier
that
even
sylvia
s
instinctive
distrust
and
dislike
of
him
had
been
lulled
a
little
for
the
moment
and
they
must
prevail
he
had
exclaimed
in
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
his
dark
eyes
flashing
it
is
inconceivable
that
they
should
ever
yield
to
the
french
although
the
odds
of
numbers
may
lie
so
heavily
against
are
the
odds
of
numbers
so
heavy
said
lady
o
moy
in
surprise
opening
wide
those
almost
childish
eyes
of
hers
alas
anything
from
three
to
five
to
one
ah
but
why
should
we
despond
on
that
account
and
his
voice
vibrated
with
renewed
confidence
the
country
is
a
difficult
one
easy
to
defend
and
lord
wellington
s
genius
will
have
made
the
best
of
it
there
are
for
example
the
fortifications
at
torres
ah
yes
i
have
heard
of
them
tell
me
about
them
tell
you
about
them
dear
lady
shall
i
carry
perfumes
to
the
rose
what
can
i
tell
you
that
you
do
not
know
so
much
better
than
myself
indeed
i
know
nothing
sir
terence
is
ridiculously
secretive
she
assured
him
with
a
little
frown
of
petulance
she
realised
that
her
husband
did
not
treat
her
as
an
intelligent
being
to
be
consulted
upon
these
matters
she
was
his
wife
and
he
had
no
right
to
keep
secrets
from
her
in
fact
she
said
so
indeed
no
samoval
agreed
and
i
find
it
hard
to
credit
that
it
should
be
then
you
forget
said
sylvia
that
these
secrets
are
not
sir
terence
s
own
they
are
the
secrets
of
his
perhaps
so
said
the
unabashed
samoval
but
if
i
were
sir
terence
i
should
desire
above
all
to
allay
my
wife
s
natural
anxiety
for
i
am
sure
you
must
be
anxious
dear
lady
o
naturally
she
agreed
whose
anxieties
never
transcended
the
fit
of
her
gowns
or
the
suitability
of
a
coiffure
but
terence
is
like
incredible
the
count
protested
and
raised
his
dark
eyes
to
heaven
as
if
invoking
its
punishment
upon
so
unnatural
a
husband
do
you
tell
me
that
you
have
never
so
much
as
seen
the
plans
of
these
fortifications
the
plans
count
she
almost
laughed
ah
he
said
i
dare
swear
then
that
you
do
not
even
know
of
their
he
was
jocular
now
i
am
sure
that
she
does
not
said
sylvia
who
instinctively
felt
that
the
conversation
was
following
an
undesirable
course
then
you
are
wrong
she
was
assured
i
saw
them
once
a
week
ago
in
sir
terence
s
why
how
would
you
know
them
if
you
saw
them
quoth
sylvia
seeking
to
cover
what
might
be
an
indiscretion
because
they
bore
the
name
lines
of
torres
i
and
this
unsympathetic
sir
terence
did
not
explain
them
to
you
laughed
samoval
indeed
he
did
in
fact
i
could
swear
that
he
locked
them
away
from
you
at
once
the
count
continued
on
a
jocular
note
not
at
once
but
he
certainly
locked
them
away
soon
after
and
whilst
i
was
still
in
your
place
then
said
samoval
ever
on
the
same
note
of
banter
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
steal
the
not
so
easily
done
she
assured
him
it
never
leaves
his
person
he
wears
it
on
a
gold
chain
round
his
what
always
always
i
assure
too
bad
protested
samoval
too
bad
indeed
what
then
should
you
have
done
miss
armytage
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
that
he
was
drawing
information
from
them
so
bantering
and
frivolous
was
his
manner
more
difficult
still
to
conceive
that
he
had
obtained
any
yet
you
will
observe
that
he
had
been
placed
in
possession
of
two
facts
that
the
plans
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
were
kept
locked
up
in
sir
terence
s
own
room
in
the
no
doubt
and
that
sir
terence
always
carried
the
key
on
a
gold
chain
worn
round
his
neck
miss
armytage
laughed
whatever
i
might
do
i
should
not
be
guilty
of
prying
into
matters
that
my
husband
kept
then
you
admit
a
husband
s
right
to
keep
matters
hidden
from
his
wife
why
not
madam
samoval
bowed
to
her
your
future
husband
is
to
be
envied
on
yet
another
and
thus
the
conversation
drifted
samoval
conceiving
that
he
had
obtained
all
the
information
of
which
lady
o
moy
was
possessed
and
satisfied
that
he
had
obtained
all
that
for
the
moment
he
required
how
to
proceed
now
was
a
more
difficult
matter
to
be
very
seriously
considered
how
to
obtain
from
sir
terence
the
key
in
question
and
reach
the
plans
so
essential
to
marshal
massena
he
was
at
table
with
them
as
you
know
when
sir
terence
and
colonel
grant
arrived
he
and
the
colonel
were
presented
to
each
other
and
bowed
with
a
gravity
quite
cordial
on
the
part
of
samoval
who
was
by
far
the
more
subtle
dissembler
of
the
two
each
knew
the
other
perfectly
for
what
he
was
yet
each
was
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
extent
of
the
other
s
knowledge
of
himself
and
certainly
neither
betrayed
anything
by
his
manner
at
table
the
conversation
was
led
naturally
enough
by
tremayne
to
wellington
s
general
order
against
duelling
this
was
inevitable
when
you
consider
that
it
was
a
topic
of
conversation
that
morning
at
every
table
to
which
british
officers
sat
down
tremayne
spoke
of
the
measure
in
terms
of
warm
commendation
thereby
provoking
a
sharp
disagreement
from
samoval
the
deep
and
almost
instinctive
hostility
between
these
two
men
which
had
often
been
revealed
in
momentary
flashes
was
such
that
it
must
invariably
lead
them
to
take
opposing
sides
in
any
matter
admitting
of
contention
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
most
arbitrary
and
degrading
enactment
said
samoval
i
say
so
without
hesitation
notwithstanding
my
profound
admiration
and
respect
for
lord
wellington
and
all
his
degrading
echoed
grant
looking
across
at
him
in
what
can
it
be
degrading
count
in
that
it
reduces
a
gentleman
to
the
level
of
the
clod
was
the
prompt
answer
a
gentleman
must
have
his
quarrels
however
sweet
his
disposition
and
a
means
must
be
afforded
him
of
settling
ye
can
always
thrash
an
impudent
fellow
opined
the
adjutant
thrash
echoed
samoval
his
sensitive
lip
curled
in
disdain
to
use
your
hands
upon
a
man
he
shuddered
in
sheer
disgust
to
one
of
my
temperament
it
would
be
impossible
and
men
of
my
temperament
are
plentiful
i
but
if
you
were
thrashed
yourself
tremayne
asked
him
and
the
light
in
his
grey
eyes
almost
hinted
at
a
dark
desire
to
be
himself
the
executioner
samoval
s
dark
handsome
eyes
considered
the
captain
steadily
to
be
thrashed
myself
he
questioned
my
dear
captain
the
idea
of
having
hands
laid
upon
me
soiling
me
brutalising
me
is
so
nauseating
so
repugnant
that
i
assure
you
i
should
not
hesitate
to
shoot
the
man
who
did
it
just
as
i
should
shoot
any
other
wild
beast
that
attacked
me
indeed
the
two
instances
are
exactly
parallel
and
my
country
s
courts
would
uphold
in
such
a
case
the
justice
of
my
then
you
may
thank
god
said
o
moy
that
you
are
not
under
british
i
do
snapped
samoval
to
make
an
instant
recovery
at
least
so
far
as
the
matter
is
and
he
elaborated
i
assure
you
sirs
it
will
be
an
evil
day
for
the
nobility
of
any
country
when
its
government
enacts
against
the
satisfaction
that
one
gentleman
has
the
right
to
demand
from
another
who
offends
isn
t
the
conversation
rather
too
bloodthirsty
for
a
wondered
lady
o
moy
and
tactlessly
she
added
thinking
with
flattery
to
mollify
samoval
and
cool
his
obvious
heat
you
are
yourself
such
a
famous
swordsman
and
then
tremayne
s
dislike
of
the
man
betrayed
him
into
his
deplorable
phrase
at
the
present
time
portugal
is
in
urgent
need
of
her
famous
swordsmen
to
go
against
the
french
and
not
to
increase
the
disorders
at
a
silence
complete
and
ominous
followed
the
rash
words
and
samoval
white
to
the
lips
pondered
the
imperturbable
captain
with
a
baleful
eye
i
think
he
said
at
last
speaking
slowly
and
softly
and
picking
his
words
with
care
i
think
that
is
innuendo
i
should
be
relieved
captain
tremayne
to
hear
you
say
that
it
is
tremayne
was
prompt
to
give
him
the
assurance
no
innuendo
at
all
a
plain
statement
of
the
innuendo
i
suggested
lay
in
the
application
of
the
phrase
do
you
make
it
personal
to
myself
of
course
not
said
sir
terence
cutting
in
and
speaking
sharply
what
an
assumption
i
am
asking
captain
tremayne
the
count
insisted
with
grim
firmness
notwithstanding
his
deferential
smile
to
sir
terence
i
spoke
quite
generally
sir
tremayne
assured
him
partly
under
the
suasion
of
sir
terence
s
interposition
partly
out
of
consideration
for
the
ladies
who
were
looking
scared
of
course
if
you
choose
to
take
it
to
yourself
sir
that
is
a
matter
for
your
own
discretion
i
think
he
added
also
with
a
smile
that
the
ladies
find
the
topic
perhaps
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
continuing
it
when
they
are
no
longer
oh
as
you
please
was
the
indifferent
answer
carruthers
may
i
trouble
you
to
pass
the
salt
lady
o
callaghan
was
complaining
the
other
night
of
the
abuse
of
salt
in
portuguese
cookery
it
is
an
abuse
i
have
never
yet
i
can
t
conceive
lady
o
callaghan
complaining
of
too
much
salt
in
anything
begad
quoth
o
moy
with
a
laugh
if
you
had
heard
the
story
she
told
me
about
terence
my
dear
his
wife
checked
him
her
fine
brows
raised
her
stare
frigid
faith
we
go
from
bad
to
worse
said
carruthers
will
you
try
to
improve
the
tone
of
the
conversation
miss
armytage
it
stands
in
urgent
need
of
with
a
general
laugh
breaking
the
ice
of
the
restraint
that
was
in
danger
of
settling
about
the
table
a
semblance
of
ease
was
restored
and
this
was
maintained
until
the
end
of
the
repast
at
last
the
ladies
rose
and
leaving
the
men
at
table
they
sauntered
off
towards
the
terrace
but
under
the
archway
sylvia
checked
her
cousin
una
she
said
gravely
you
had
better
call
captain
tremayne
and
take
him
away
for
the
una
s
eyes
opened
wide
why
she
inquired
miss
armytage
was
almost
impatient
with
her
didn
t
you
see
resentment
is
only
slumbering
between
those
men
it
will
break
out
again
now
that
we
have
left
them
unless
you
can
get
captain
tremayne
una
continued
to
look
at
her
cousin
and
then
her
mind
fastening
ever
upon
the
trivial
to
the
exclusion
of
the
important
her
glance
became
arch
for
whom
is
your
concern
for
count
samoval
or
ned
she
inquired
and
added
with
a
laugh
you
needn
t
answer
me
it
is
ned
you
are
afraid
i
am
certainly
not
afraid
for
him
was
the
reply
on
a
faint
note
of
indignation
she
had
reddened
slightly
but
i
should
not
like
to
see
captain
tremayne
or
any
other
british
officer
embroiled
in
a
duel
you
forget
lord
wellington
s
order
which
they
were
discussing
and
the
consequences
of
infringing
lady
o
moy
became
scared
you
don
t
imagine
sylvia
spoke
quickly
i
am
certain
that
unless
you
take
captain
tremayne
away
and
at
once
there
will
be
serious
and
now
behold
lady
o
moy
thrown
into
a
state
of
alarm
that
bordered
upon
terror
she
had
more
reason
than
sylvia
could
dream
more
reason
she
conceived
than
sylvia
herself
to
wish
to
keep
captain
tremayne
out
of
trouble
just
at
present
instantly
agitatedly
she
turned
and
called
to
him
ned
floated
her
silvery
voice
across
the
enclosed
garden
and
again
ned
i
want
you
at
once
captain
tremayne
rose
grant
was
talking
briskly
at
the
time
his
intention
being
to
cover
tremayne
s
retreat
which
he
himself
desired
count
samoval
s
smouldering
eyes
were
upon
the
captain
and
full
of
menace
but
he
could
not
be
guilty
of
the
rudeness
of
interrupting
grant
or
of
detaining
captain
tremayne
when
a
lady
called
him
chapter
xi
the
challenge
rebuke
awaited
captain
tremayne
at
the
hands
of
lady
o
moy
and
it
came
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
sauntering
in
the
thicket
of
pine
and
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
below
the
terrace
how
thoughtless
of
you
ned
to
provoke
count
samoval
at
such
a
time
as
this
did
i
provoke
him
i
thought
it
was
the
count
himself
who
was
tremayne
spoke
lightly
but
suppose
anything
were
to
happen
to
you
you
know
the
man
s
dreadful
tremayne
looked
at
her
kindly
this
apparent
concern
for
himself
touched
him
my
dear
una
i
hope
i
can
take
care
of
myself
even
against
so
formidable
a
fellow
and
after
all
a
man
must
take
his
chances
a
soldier
but
what
of
dick
she
cried
do
you
forget
that
he
is
depending
entirely
upon
you
that
if
you
should
fail
him
he
will
be
lost
and
there
was
something
akin
to
indignation
in
the
protesting
eyes
she
turned
upon
him
for
a
moment
tremayne
was
so
amazed
that
he
was
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
then
he
smiled
indeed
his
inclination
was
to
laugh
outright
the
frank
admission
that
her
concern
which
he
had
fondly
imagined
to
be
for
himself
was
all
for
dick
betrayed
a
state
of
mind
that
was
entirely
typical
of
una
never
had
she
been
able
to
command
more
than
one
point
of
view
of
any
question
and
that
point
of
view
invariably
of
her
own
interest
all
her
life
she
had
been
accustomed
to
sacrifices
great
and
small
made
by
others
on
her
own
behalf
until
she
had
come
to
look
upon
such
sacrifices
her
absolute
right
i
am
glad
you
reminded
me
he
said
with
an
irony
that
never
touched
her
you
may
depend
upon
me
to
be
discreetness
itself
at
least
until
after
dick
has
been
safely
thank
you
ned
you
are
very
good
to
they
sauntered
a
little
way
in
silence
then
when
does
captain
glennie
sail
she
asked
him
is
it
decided
yet
yes
i
have
just
heard
from
him
that
the
telemachus
will
put
to
sea
on
sunday
morning
at
two
o
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
what
an
uncomfortable
hour
tides
as
king
canute
discovered
are
beyond
mortal
control
the
telemachus
goes
out
with
the
ebb
and
after
all
for
our
purposes
surely
no
hour
could
be
more
suitable
if
i
come
for
dick
at
midnight
tomorrow
that
will
just
give
us
time
to
get
him
snugly
aboard
before
she
sails
i
have
made
all
arrangements
with
glennie
he
believes
dick
to
be
what
he
has
represented
himself
one
of
bearsley
s
overseers
named
jenkinson
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
who
must
be
got
out
of
the
country
quietly
dick
should
thank
his
luck
for
a
good
deal
my
chief
anxiety
was
lest
his
presence
here
should
be
discovered
by
any
beyond
bridget
not
a
soul
knows
that
he
is
here
not
even
you
have
been
the
soul
of
haven
t
i
she
purred
delighted
to
have
him
discover
a
virtue
so
unusual
in
her
thereafter
they
discussed
details
or
rather
tremayne
discussed
them
he
would
come
up
to
monsanto
at
twelve
o
clock
night
in
a
curricle
in
which
he
would
drive
dick
down
to
the
river
at
a
point
where
a
boat
would
be
waiting
to
take
him
out
to
the
telemachus
she
must
see
that
dick
was
ready
in
time
the
rest
she
could
safely
leave
to
him
he
would
come
in
through
the
official
wing
of
the
building
the
guard
would
admit
him
without
question
accustomed
to
seeing
him
come
and
go
at
all
hours
nor
would
it
be
remarked
that
he
was
accompanied
by
a
man
in
civilian
dress
when
he
departed
dick
was
to
be
let
down
from
her
ladyship
s
balcony
to
the
quadrangle
by
a
rope
ladder
with
which
tremayne
would
come
equipped
having
procured
it
for
the
purpose
from
the
telemachus
she
hung
upon
his
arm
overwhelming
him
now
with
her
gratitude
her
parasol
sheltering
them
both
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
as
they
emerged
from
the
thicket
intro
the
meadowland
in
full
view
of
the
terrace
where
count
samoval
and
sir
terence
were
at
that
moment
talking
earnestly
together
you
will
remember
that
o
moy
had
undertaken
to
provide
that
count
samoval
s
visits
to
monsanto
should
be
discontinued
about
this
task
he
had
gone
with
all
the
tact
of
which
he
had
boasted
himself
master
to
colquhoun
grant
you
shall
judge
of
the
tact
for
yourself
no
sooner
had
the
colonel
left
for
lisbon
and
carruthers
to
return
to
his
work
than
finding
himself
alone
with
the
count
sir
terence
considered
the
moment
a
choice
one
in
which
to
broach
the
matter
i
take
it
ye
re
fond
of
walking
count
had
been
his
singular
opening
move
they
had
left
the
table
by
now
and
were
sauntering
together
on
the
terrace
walking
said
samoval
i
detest
and
is
that
so
well
well
of
course
it
s
not
so
very
far
from
your
place
at
not
more
than
i
should
just
so
said
o
moy
there
and
back
a
league
it
s
nothing
at
all
of
course
yet
for
a
gentleman
who
detests
walking
it
s
a
devilish
long
tramp
for
for
nothing
samoval
checked
and
looked
at
his
host
in
faint
surprise
then
he
smiled
very
affably
but
you
must
not
say
that
sir
terence
i
assure
you
that
the
pleasure
of
seeing
yourself
and
lady
o
moy
can
not
be
spoken
of
as
you
are
very
sir
terence
was
the
very
quintessence
of
courtliness
of
concern
for
the
other
but
if
there
were
not
that
pleasure
then
of
course
it
would
be
samoval
was
beginning
to
be
slightly
intrigued
that
s
it
said
sir
terence
that
s
just
what
i
m
just
what
you
re
meaning
but
my
dear
general
you
are
assuming
circumstances
which
fortunately
do
not
not
at
present
perhaps
but
they
again
samoval
stood
still
and
looked
at
o
moy
he
found
something
in
the
bronzed
rugged
face
that
was
unusually
sardonic
the
blue
eyes
seemed
to
have
become
hard
and
yet
there
were
wrinkles
about
their
corners
suggestive
of
humour
that
might
be
mockery
the
count
stiffened
but
beyond
that
he
preserved
his
outward
calm
whilst
confessing
that
he
did
not
understand
sir
terence
s
meaning
it
s
this
way
said
sir
terence
i
ve
noticed
that
ye
re
not
looking
so
very
well
lately
really
you
think
that
the
words
were
mechanical
the
dark
eyes
continued
to
scrutinise
that
bronzed
face
suspiciously
i
do
and
it
s
sorry
i
am
to
see
it
but
i
know
what
it
is
it
s
this
walking
backwards
and
forwards
between
here
and
bispo
that
s
doing
the
mischief
better
give
it
up
count
better
not
come
toiling
up
here
any
more
it
s
not
good
for
your
health
why
man
ye
re
as
white
as
a
ghost
this
he
was
indeed
having
perceived
at
last
the
insult
intended
to
be
denied
the
house
at
such
a
time
was
to
checkmate
his
designs
to
set
a
term
upon
his
crafty
and
subtle
espionage
precisely
in
the
season
when
he
hoped
to
reap
its
harvest
but
his
chagrin
sprang
not
at
all
from
that
his
cold
anger
was
purely
personal
he
was
a
gentleman
of
the
fine
flower
as
he
would
have
described
himself
of
the
nobility
of
portugal
and
that
a
probably
upstart
irish
soldier
himself
from
samoval
s
point
of
view
a
guest
in
that
country
should
deny
him
his
house
and
choose
such
terms
of
jocularity
in
which
to
do
it
was
an
affront
beyond
all
endurance
for
a
moment
passion
blinded
him
and
it
was
only
by
an
effort
that
he
recovered
and
kept
his
but
keep
it
he
did
you
may
trust
your
practised
duellist
for
that
when
he
comes
face
to
face
with
the
necessity
to
demand
satisfaction
and
soon
the
mist
of
passion
clearing
from
his
keen
wits
he
sought
swiftly
for
a
means
to
fasten
the
quarrel
upon
sir
terence
in
sir
terence
s
own
coin
of
galling
mockery
instantly
he
found
it
indeed
it
was
not
very
far
to
seek
o
moy
s
jealousy
which
was
almost
a
byword
as
we
know
had
been
apparent
more
than
once
to
samoval
remembering
it
now
it
discovered
to
him
at
once
sir
terence
s
most
vulnerable
spot
and
cunningly
samoval
proceeded
to
gall
him
there
a
smile
spread
gradually
over
his
white
face
a
smile
of
immeasurable
malice
i
am
having
a
very
interesting
and
instructive
morning
in
this
atmosphere
of
irish
boorishness
said
he
first
captain
tremayne
now
don
t
be
after
blaming
old
ireland
for
tremayne
s
shortcomings
tremayne
s
just
a
clumsy
mannered
i
am
glad
to
know
there
is
a
distinction
indeed
i
might
have
perceived
it
for
myself
in
motives
of
course
that
distinction
is
great
indeed
and
i
hope
that
i
am
not
slow
to
discover
it
and
in
your
case
to
excuse
it
i
quite
understand
and
even
sympathise
with
your
feelings
i
am
glad
of
that
now
said
sir
terence
who
had
understood
nothing
of
all
this
naturally
the
count
pursued
on
a
smooth
level
note
of
amiability
when
a
man
himself
no
longer
young
commits
the
folly
of
taking
a
young
and
charming
wife
he
is
to
be
forgiven
when
a
natural
anxiety
drives
him
to
lengths
which
in
another
might
be
he
bowed
before
the
empurpling
sir
terence
ye
re
a
damned
coxcomb
it
seems
was
the
answering
roar
of
course
you
would
assume
it
it
was
to
be
expected
i
condone
it
with
the
rest
and
because
i
condone
it
because
i
sympathise
with
what
in
a
man
of
your
age
and
temperament
must
amount
to
an
affliction
i
hasten
to
assure
you
upon
my
honour
that
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
there
are
no
grounds
for
your
and
who
the
devil
asks
for
your
assurances
it
s
stark
mad
ye
are
to
suppose
that
i
ever
needed
of
course
you
must
say
that
samoval
insisted
with
a
confident
and
superior
smile
he
shook
his
head
his
expression
one
of
amused
sorrow
sir
terence
you
have
knocked
at
the
wrong
door
you
are
youthful
at
least
in
your
impulsiveness
but
you
are
surely
as
blind
as
old
pantaloon
in
the
comedy
or
you
would
see
where
your
industry
would
be
better
employed
in
shielding
your
wife
s
honour
and
your
goaded
to
fury
his
blue
eyes
aflame
now
with
passion
sir
terence
considered
the
sleek
and
subtle
gentleman
before
him
and
it
was
in
that
moment
that
the
count
s
subtlety
soared
to
its
finest
heights
in
a
flash
of
inspiration
he
perceived
the
advantages
to
be
drawn
by
himself
from
conducting
this
quarrel
to
extremes
this
is
not
mere
idle
speculation
knowledge
of
the
real
motives
actuating
him
rests
upon
the
evidence
of
a
letter
which
samoval
was
to
write
that
same
evening
to
la
fleche
afterwards
to
be
discovered
wherein
he
related
what
had
passed
how
deliberately
he
had
steered
the
matter
and
what
he
meant
to
do
his
object
was
no
longer
the
punishing
of
an
affront
that
would
happen
as
a
mere
incident
a
thing
done
as
it
were
in
passing
his
real
aim
now
was
to
obtain
the
keys
of
the
adjutant
s
which
never
left
sir
terence
s
person
and
so
become
possessed
of
the
plans
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
when
you
consider
in
the
light
of
this
the
manner
in
which
samoval
proceeded
now
you
will
admire
with
me
at
once
the
opportunism
and
the
subtlety
of
the
man
you
ll
be
after
telling
me
exactly
what
you
mean
sir
terence
had
said
it
was
in
that
moment
that
tremayne
and
lady
o
moy
came
arm
in
arm
into
the
open
on
the
away
very
close
and
confidential
they
came
most
opportunely
to
the
count
s
need
and
he
flung
out
a
hand
to
indicate
them
to
sir
terence
a
smile
of
pity
on
his
lips
you
need
but
to
look
to
take
the
answer
for
yourself
said
he
sir
terence
looked
and
laughed
he
knew
the
secret
of
ned
tremayne
s
heart
and
could
laugh
now
with
relish
at
that
which
hitherto
had
left
him
darkly
suspicious
and
who
shall
blame
lady
o
moy
count
samoval
pursued
a
lady
so
charming
and
so
courted
must
seek
her
consolation
for
the
almost
unnatural
union
fate
has
imposed
upon
her
captain
tremayne
is
of
her
own
age
convenient
to
her
hand
and
for
an
englishman
not
he
smiled
at
o
moy
with
insolent
compassion
and
o
moy
losing
all
his
struck
him
slapped
him
resoundingly
upon
the
cheek
ye
re
a
dirty
liar
samoval
a
said
he
samoval
stepped
back
breathing
hard
one
cheek
red
the
other
white
yet
by
a
miracle
he
still
preserved
his
i
have
proved
my
courage
too
often
he
said
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
killing
you
for
this
blow
since
my
honour
is
safe
i
will
not
take
advantage
of
your
overwrought
ye
ll
take
advantage
of
it
whether
ye
like
it
or
not
blazed
sir
terence
at
him
i
mean
you
to
take
advantage
of
it
d
ye
think
i
ll
suffer
any
man
to
cast
a
slur
upon
lady
o
moy
i
ll
be
sending
my
friends
to
wait
on
you
count
and
by
god
tremayne
himself
shall
be
one
of
thus
did
the
fellow
deliver
himself
into
the
hands
of
his
enemy
nor
was
he
warned
when
he
saw
the
sudden
gleam
in
samoval
s
dark
eyes
ha
said
the
count
it
was
a
little
exclamation
of
wicked
satisfaction
you
are
offering
me
a
challenge
then
if
i
may
make
so
bold
and
as
i
ve
a
mind
to
shoot
you
dead
shoot
did
you
say
samoval
interrupted
gently
i
said
shoot
and
it
shall
be
at
ten
paces
or
across
a
handkerchief
or
any
damned
distance
you
the
count
shook
his
head
he
sneered
i
think
not
not
and
he
waved
the
notion
aside
with
a
hand
white
and
slender
as
a
woman
s
that
is
too
english
or
too
irish
the
pistol
i
mean
appropriately
a
fool
s
and
he
explained
himself
explained
at
last
his
extraordinary
forbearance
under
a
blow
if
you
think
i
have
practised
the
every
day
of
my
life
for
ten
years
to
suffer
myself
to
be
shot
at
like
a
rabbit
in
the
end
ho
really
he
laughed
aloud
you
have
challenged
me
i
think
sir
terence
because
i
feared
the
predilection
you
have
discovered
i
was
careful
to
wait
until
the
challenge
came
from
you
the
choice
of
weapons
lies
i
think
with
me
i
shall
instruct
my
friends
to
ask
for
sorry
a
difference
will
it
make
to
me
said
sir
terence
anything
from
a
horsewhip
to
a
and
then
recollection
descending
like
a
cold
hand
upon
him
chilled
his
hot
rage
struck
the
fine
irish
arrogance
all
out
of
him
and
left
him
suddenly
limp
my
god
he
said
and
it
was
almost
a
groan
he
detained
samoval
who
had
already
turned
to
depart
a
moment
count
he
cried
i
i
had
forgotten
there
is
the
general
order
lord
wellington
s
awkward
of
course
said
samoval
who
had
never
for
a
moment
been
oblivious
of
that
enactment
and
who
had
been
carefully
building
upon
it
but
you
should
have
considered
it
before
committing
yourself
so
sir
terence
steadied
himself
he
recovered
his
truculence
irrevocable
or
not
it
will
just
have
to
be
revocable
the
meeting
s
i
do
not
see
the
impossibility
i
am
not
surprised
you
should
shelter
yourself
behind
an
enactment
but
you
will
remember
this
enactment
does
not
apply
to
me
who
am
not
a
but
it
applies
to
me
who
am
not
only
a
soldier
but
the
here
the
man
chiefly
responsible
for
seeing
the
order
carried
out
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
if
i
were
the
first
to
disregard
i
am
afraid
it
is
too
late
you
have
disregarded
it
already
how
so
the
letter
of
the
law
is
against
sending
or
receiving
a
challenge
i
o
moy
was
distracted
samoval
he
said
drawing
himself
up
i
will
admit
that
i
have
been
a
fool
i
will
apologise
to
you
for
the
blow
and
for
the
word
that
accompanied
the
apology
would
imply
that
my
statement
was
a
true
one
and
that
you
recognised
it
if
you
mean
that
i
mean
nothing
of
the
kind
damme
i
ve
a
mind
to
horsewhip
you
and
leave
it
at
that
d
ye
think
i
want
to
face
a
firing
party
on
your
account
i
don
t
think
there
is
the
remotest
likelihood
of
any
such
contingency
replied
samoval
but
o
moy
went
headlong
on
and
another
thing
where
will
i
be
finding
a
friend
to
meet
your
friends
who
will
dare
to
act
for
me
in
view
of
that
enactment
the
count
considered
he
was
grave
now
of
course
that
is
a
difficulty
he
admitted
as
if
he
perceived
it
now
for
the
first
time
under
the
circumstances
sir
terence
and
entirely
to
accommodate
you
i
might
consent
to
dispense
with
dispense
with
seconds
sir
terence
was
horrified
at
the
suggestion
you
know
that
that
is
irregular
that
a
charge
of
murder
would
lie
against
the
oh
quite
so
but
it
is
for
your
own
convenience
that
i
suggest
it
though
i
appreciate
your
considerate
concern
on
the
score
of
what
may
happen
to
me
afterwards
should
it
come
to
be
known
that
i
was
your
afterwards
after
what
after
i
have
killed
and
is
it
like
that
cried
o
moy
his
countenance
inflaming
again
his
mind
casting
all
prudence
to
the
winds
it
followed
of
course
that
without
further
thought
for
anything
but
the
satisfaction
of
his
rage
sir
terence
became
as
wax
in
the
hands
of
samoval
s
desires
where
do
you
suggest
that
we
meet
he
asked
there
is
my
place
at
bispo
we
should
be
private
in
the
gardens
there
as
for
time
the
sooner
the
better
though
for
secrecy
s
sake
we
had
better
meet
at
night
shall
we
say
at
midnight
but
sir
terence
would
agree
to
none
of
this
is
out
of
the
question
for
me
i
have
an
engagement
that
will
keep
me
until
late
night
if
you
will
i
shall
be
at
your
and
because
he
did
not
trust
samoval
he
added
as
samoval
himself
had
almost
reckoned
but
i
should
prefer
not
to
come
to
bispo
i
might
be
seen
going
or
since
there
are
no
such
scruples
on
my
side
i
am
ready
to
come
to
you
here
if
you
prefer
it
would
suit
me
then
expect
me
promptly
at
midnight
provided
that
you
can
arrange
to
admit
me
without
my
being
seen
you
will
perceive
my
those
gates
will
be
closed
said
o
moy
indicating
the
now
gaping
massive
doors
that
closed
the
archway
at
night
but
if
you
knock
i
shall
be
waiting
for
you
and
i
will
admit
you
by
the
excellent
said
samoval
suavely
then
until
night
he
bowed
with
almost
extravagant
submission
and
turning
walked
sharply
away
energy
and
suppleness
in
every
line
of
his
slight
figure
leaving
sir
terence
to
the
unpleasant
almost
desperate
thoughts
that
reflection
must
usher
in
as
his
anger
faded
chapter
xii
the
duel
it
was
a
time
of
stress
and
even
of
temptation
for
sir
terence
honour
and
pride
demanded
that
he
should
keep
the
appointment
made
with
samoval
common
sense
urged
him
at
all
costs
to
avoid
it
his
frame
of
mind
you
see
was
not
at
all
enviable
at
moments
he
would
consider
his
position
as
the
enactment
against
duelling
the
irregularity
of
the
meeting
arranged
and
consequently
the
danger
in
which
he
stood
on
every
score
at
others
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
unpardonable
affront
that
had
been
offered
him
and
the
venomously
insulting
manner
in
which
it
had
been
offered
and
his
rage
welled
up
to
blot
out
every
consideration
other
than
that
of
punishing
samoval
for
two
days
and
a
night
he
was
a
sort
of
shuttlecock
tossed
between
these
alternating
moods
and
he
was
still
the
same
when
he
paced
the
quadrangle
with
bowed
head
and
hands
clasped
behind
him
awaiting
samoval
at
a
few
minutes
before
twelve
of
the
following
night
the
windows
that
looked
down
from
the
four
sides
of
that
enclosed
garden
were
all
in
darkness
the
members
of
the
household
had
withdrawn
over
an
hour
ago
and
were
asleep
by
now
the
official
quarters
were
closed
the
rising
moon
had
just
mounted
above
the
eastern
wing
and
its
white
light
fell
upon
the
upper
half
of
the
facade
of
the
residential
site
the
quadrangle
itself
remained
plunged
in
gloom
sir
terence
pacing
there
was
considering
the
only
definite
conclusion
he
had
reached
if
there
were
no
way
even
now
of
avoiding
this
duel
at
least
it
must
remain
secret
therefore
it
could
not
take
place
here
in
the
enclosed
garden
of
his
own
quarters
as
he
had
so
rashly
consented
it
should
be
fought
upon
neutral
ground
where
the
presence
of
the
body
of
the
slain
would
not
call
for
explanations
by
the
survivor
from
distant
lisbon
on
the
still
air
came
softly
the
chimes
of
midnight
and
immediately
there
was
a
sharp
rap
upon
the
little
door
set
in
one
of
the
massive
gates
that
closed
the
archway
sir
terence
went
to
open
the
wicket
and
samoval
stepped
quickly
over
the
sill
he
was
wrapped
in
a
dark
cloak
a
hat
obscured
his
face
sir
terence
closed
the
door
again
the
two
men
bowed
to
each
other
in
silence
and
as
samoval
s
cloak
fell
open
he
produced
a
pair
of
swathed
together
in
a
skin
of
leather
you
are
very
punctual
sir
said
o
moy
i
hope
i
shall
never
be
so
discourteous
as
to
keep
an
opponent
waiting
it
is
a
thing
of
which
i
have
never
yet
been
guilty
replied
samoval
with
deadly
smoothness
in
that
reminder
of
his
victorious
past
he
stepped
forward
and
looked
about
the
quadrangle
i
am
afraid
the
moon
will
occasion
us
some
delay
he
said
it
were
perhaps
better
to
wait
some
five
or
ten
minutes
by
then
the
light
in
here
should
have
we
can
avoid
the
delay
by
stepping
out
into
the
open
said
sir
terence
indeed
it
is
what
i
had
to
suggest
in
any
case
there
are
inconveniences
here
which
you
may
have
but
samoval
who
had
purposes
to
serve
of
which
this
duel
was
but
a
preliminary
was
of
a
very
different
mind
we
are
quite
private
here
your
household
being
abed
he
answered
whilst
outside
one
can
never
be
sure
even
at
this
hour
of
avoiding
witnesses
and
interruption
then
again
the
turf
is
smooth
as
a
table
on
that
patch
of
lawn
and
the
ground
well
known
to
both
of
us
that
i
can
assure
you
is
a
very
necessary
condition
in
the
dark
and
one
not
to
be
found
haphazard
in
the
but
there
is
yet
another
consideration
sir
i
prefer
that
we
engage
on
neutral
ground
so
that
the
survivor
shall
not
be
called
upon
for
explanations
that
might
be
demanded
if
we
fought
even
in
the
gloom
sir
terence
caught
the
flash
of
samoval
s
white
teeth
as
he
smiled
you
trouble
yourself
unnecessarily
on
my
account
was
the
smoothly
ironic
answer
no
one
has
seen
me
come
and
no
one
is
likely
to
see
me
you
may
be
sure
that
no
one
shall
by
god
snapped
o
moy
stung
by
the
sly
insolence
of
the
other
s
assurance
shall
we
get
to
work
then
samoval
invited
if
you
re
set
on
dying
here
i
suppose
i
must
be
after
humouring
you
and
make
the
best
of
it
as
soon
as
you
please
o
moy
was
very
fierce
they
stepped
to
the
patch
of
lawn
in
the
middle
of
the
quadrangle
and
there
samoval
threw
off
altogether
his
cloak
and
hat
he
was
closely
dressed
in
black
which
in
that
light
rendered
him
almost
invisible
sir
terence
less
practised
and
less
calculating
in
these
matters
wore
an
undress
uniform
the
red
coat
of
which
showed
greyish
samoval
observed
this
rather
with
contempt
than
with
satisfaction
in
the
advantage
it
afforded
him
then
he
removed
the
swathing
from
the
swords
and
crossing
them
presented
the
hilts
to
sir
terence
the
adjutant
took
one
and
the
count
retained
the
other
which
he
tested
thrashing
the
air
with
it
so
that
it
hummed
like
a
whip
that
done
however
he
did
not
immediately
fall
on
in
a
few
minutes
the
moon
will
be
more
obliging
he
suggested
if
you
would
prefer
to
wait
but
it
occurred
to
sir
terence
that
in
the
gloom
the
advantage
might
lie
slightly
with
himself
since
the
other
s
superior
would
perhaps
be
partly
neutralised
he
cast
a
last
look
round
at
the
dark
windows
i
find
it
light
enough
he
answered
samoval
s
reply
was
instantaneous
on
guard
then
he
cried
and
on
the
words
without
giving
sir
terence
so
much
as
time
to
comply
with
the
invitation
he
whirled
his
point
straight
and
deadly
at
the
greyish
outline
of
his
opponent
s
body
but
a
ray
of
moonlight
caught
the
blade
and
its
livid
flash
gave
sir
terence
warning
of
the
thrust
so
treacherously
delivered
he
saved
himself
by
leaping
backwards
just
saved
himself
with
not
an
inch
to
spare
and
threw
up
his
blade
to
meet
the
thrust
ye
murderous
villain
he
snarled
under
his
breath
as
steel
ground
on
steel
and
he
flung
forward
to
the
attack
but
from
the
gloom
came
a
little
laugh
to
answer
him
and
his
angry
lunge
was
foiled
by
an
enveloping
movement
that
ended
in
a
ripost
with
that
they
settled
down
to
it
sir
terence
in
a
rage
upon
which
that
assassin
stroke
had
been
fresh
fuel
the
count
cool
and
unhurried
delaying
until
the
moonlight
should
have
crept
a
little
farther
so
as
to
enable
him
to
make
quite
sure
that
his
stroke
when
delivered
should
be
final
meanwhile
he
pressed
sir
terence
towards
the
side
where
the
moonlight
would
strike
first
until
they
were
fighting
close
under
the
windows
of
the
residential
wing
sir
terence
with
his
back
to
them
samoval
facing
them
it
was
fate
that
placed
them
so
the
fate
that
watched
over
sir
terence
even
now
when
he
felt
his
strength
failing
him
his
sword
arm
turning
to
lead
under
the
strain
of
an
unwonted
exercise
he
knew
himself
beaten
realised
the
dexterous
ease
the
masterly
economy
of
vigour
and
the
deadly
sureness
of
his
opponent
s
play
he
knew
that
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
samoval
he
was
even
beginning
to
wonder
why
the
count
should
delay
to
make
an
end
of
a
situation
of
which
he
was
so
completely
master
and
then
quite
suddenly
even
as
he
was
returning
thanks
that
he
had
taken
the
precaution
of
putting
all
his
affairs
in
order
something
happened
a
light
showed
it
flared
up
suddenly
to
be
as
suddenly
extinguished
and
it
had
its
source
in
the
window
of
lady
o
moy
s
which
samoval
was
facing
that
flash
drawing
off
the
count
s
eyes
for
one
instant
and
leaving
them
blinded
for
another
had
revealed
him
clearly
at
the
same
time
to
sir
terence
sir
terence
s
blade
darted
in
driven
by
all
that
was
left
of
his
spent
strength
and
samoval
his
eyes
unseeing
in
that
moment
had
fumbled
widely
and
failed
to
find
the
other
s
steel
until
he
felt
it
sinking
through
his
body
searing
him
from
breast
to
back
his
arms
sank
to
his
sides
quite
nervelessly
he
uttered
a
faint
exclamation
of
astonishment
almost
instantly
interrupted
by
a
cough
he
swayed
there
a
moment
the
cough
increasing
until
it
choked
him
then
suddenly
limp
he
pitched
forward
upon
his
face
and
lay
clawing
and
twitching
at
sir
terence
s
feet
sir
terence
himself
scarcely
realising
what
had
taken
place
for
the
whole
thing
had
happened
within
the
time
of
a
couple
of
stood
quite
still
amazed
and
awed
in
a
attitude
looking
down
at
the
body
of
the
fallen
man
and
then
from
above
ringing
upon
the
deathly
stillness
he
caught
a
sibilant
whisper
what
was
that
sh
he
stepped
back
softly
and
flattened
himself
instinctively
against
the
wall
thence
profoundly
intrigued
and
vaguely
alarmed
on
several
scores
he
peered
up
at
the
windows
of
his
wife
s
room
whence
the
sound
had
come
whence
the
sudden
light
had
come
which
as
he
now
realised
had
given
him
the
victory
in
that
unequal
contest
looking
up
at
the
balcony
in
whose
shadow
he
stood
concealed
he
saw
two
figures
there
his
wife
s
and
another
s
and
at
the
same
time
he
caught
sight
of
something
black
that
dangled
from
the
narrow
balcony
and
peered
more
closely
to
discover
a
rope
ladder
he
felt
his
skin
roughening
bristling
like
a
dog
s
he
was
conscious
of
being
cold
from
head
to
foot
as
if
the
flow
of
his
blood
had
been
suddenly
arrested
and
a
sense
of
sickness
overcame
him
and
then
to
turn
that
horrible
doubt
of
his
into
still
more
horrible
certainty
came
a
man
s
voice
subdued
yet
not
so
subdued
but
that
he
recognised
it
for
ned
tremayne
s
there
s
some
one
lying
there
i
can
make
out
the
don
t
go
down
for
pity
s
sake
come
back
come
back
and
wait
ned
if
any
one
should
come
and
find
you
we
shall
be
thus
hoarsely
whispering
vibrating
with
terror
the
voice
of
his
wife
reached
o
moy
to
confirm
him
the
unsuspecting
blind
cuckold
that
samoval
had
dubbed
him
to
his
face
for
which
samoval
warning
the
guilty
pair
with
his
last
breath
even
as
he
had
earlier
so
mockingly
warned
sir
terence
had
coughed
up
his
soul
on
the
turf
of
that
enclosed
garden
crouching
there
for
a
moment
longer
a
man
bereft
of
movement
and
of
reason
stood
o
moy
conscious
only
of
pain
in
an
agony
of
mind
and
heart
that
at
one
and
the
same
time
froze
his
blood
and
drew
the
sweat
from
his
brow
then
he
was
for
stepping
out
into
the
open
and
giving
flow
to
the
rage
and
surging
violence
that
followed
calling
down
the
man
who
had
dishonoured
him
and
slaying
him
there
under
the
eyes
of
that
trull
who
had
brought
him
to
this
shame
but
he
controlled
the
impulse
or
else
satan
controlled
it
for
him
that
way
whispered
the
tempter
was
too
straight
and
simple
he
must
think
he
must
have
time
to
readjust
his
mind
to
the
horrible
circumstances
so
suddenly
revealed
very
soft
and
silently
keeping
well
within
the
shadow
of
the
wall
he
sidled
to
the
door
which
he
had
left
ajar
soundlessly
he
pushed
it
open
passed
in
and
as
soundlessly
closed
it
again
for
a
moment
he
stood
leaning
heavily
against
its
timbers
his
breath
coming
in
short
panting
sobs
then
he
steadied
himself
and
turning
made
his
way
down
the
corridor
to
the
little
study
which
had
been
fitted
up
for
him
in
the
residential
wing
and
where
sometimes
he
worked
at
night
he
had
been
writing
there
that
evening
ever
since
dinner
and
he
had
quitted
the
room
only
to
go
to
his
assignation
with
samoval
leaving
the
lamp
burning
on
his
open
desk
he
opened
the
door
but
before
passing
in
he
paused
a
moment
straining
his
ears
to
listen
for
sounds
overhead
his
eyes
glancing
up
and
down
were
arrested
by
a
thin
blade
of
light
under
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
it
was
the
door
of
the
butler
s
pantry
and
the
line
of
light
announced
that
mullins
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
at
once
sir
terence
understood
that
knowing
him
to
be
at
work
the
old
servant
had
himself
remained
below
in
case
his
master
should
want
anything
before
retiring
continuing
to
move
without
noise
sir
terence
entered
his
study
closed
the
door
and
crossed
to
his
desk
wearily
he
dropped
into
the
chair
that
stood
before
it
his
face
drawn
and
ghastly
his
smouldering
eyes
staring
vacantly
ahead
on
the
desk
before
him
lay
the
letters
that
he
had
spent
the
past
hours
in
writing
one
to
his
wife
another
to
tremayne
another
to
his
brother
in
ireland
and
several
others
connected
with
his
official
duties
making
provision
for
their
uninterrupted
continuance
in
the
event
of
his
not
surviving
the
encounter
now
it
happened
that
amongst
the
latter
there
was
one
that
was
destined
hereafter
to
play
a
considerable
part
it
was
a
note
for
the
upon
a
matter
that
demanded
immediate
attention
and
the
only
one
of
all
those
letters
that
need
now
survive
it
was
marked
most
urgent
and
had
been
left
by
him
for
delivery
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
pulled
open
a
drawer
and
swept
into
it
all
the
letters
he
had
written
save
that
one
he
locked
that
drawer
then
unlocked
another
and
took
thence
a
case
of
pistols
with
shaking
hands
he
lifted
out
one
of
the
weapons
to
examine
it
and
all
the
while
of
course
his
thoughts
were
upon
his
wife
and
tremayne
he
was
considering
how
had
been
his
every
twinge
of
jealousy
how
wasted
how
senseless
the
reactions
of
shame
that
had
followed
them
how
insensate
his
trust
in
tremayne
s
honesty
and
above
all
with
what
crafty
treacherous
subtlety
tremayne
had
drawn
a
red
herring
across
the
trail
of
his
suspicions
by
pretending
to
an
unutterable
passion
for
sylvia
armytage
it
was
perhaps
that
piece
of
duplicity
worthy
he
thought
of
the
iscariot
himself
that
galled
sir
terence
now
most
sorely
that
and
the
memory
of
his
own
silly
credulity
he
had
been
such
a
ready
dupe
how
those
two
together
must
have
laughed
at
him
oh
tremayne
had
been
very
subtle
he
had
been
the
friend
the
parading
his
affection
for
the
butler
family
to
excuse
the
familiarities
with
lady
o
moy
which
he
had
permitted
himself
under
sir
terence
s
very
eyes
o
moy
thought
of
them
as
he
had
seen
them
in
the
garden
on
the
night
of
redondo
s
ball
remembered
the
air
of
transparent
honesty
by
which
that
damned
hypocrite
when
discovered
had
deflected
his
just
resentment
oh
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
treacherous
blackguard
had
been
subtle
but
by
god
subtlety
should
be
repaid
with
subtlety
he
would
deal
with
tremayne
as
cruelly
as
tremayne
had
dealt
with
him
and
his
wanton
wife
too
should
be
repaid
in
kind
he
beheld
the
way
clear
in
a
flash
of
wicked
inspiration
he
put
back
the
pistol
slapped
down
the
lid
of
the
box
and
replaced
it
in
its
drawer
he
rose
took
up
the
letter
to
the
stepped
briskly
to
the
door
and
pulled
it
open
mullins
he
called
sharply
are
you
there
mullins
came
the
sound
of
a
scraping
chair
and
instantly
that
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
was
thrown
open
and
mullins
stood
silhouetted
against
the
light
behind
him
a
moment
he
stood
there
then
came
forward
you
called
sir
terence
sir
terence
s
voice
was
miraculously
calm
his
back
was
to
the
light
and
his
face
in
shadow
so
that
its
drawn
haggard
look
was
not
perceptible
to
the
butler
i
am
going
to
bed
but
first
i
want
you
to
step
across
to
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
with
this
letter
for
the
tell
him
that
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
and
ask
him
to
arrange
to
have
it
taken
into
lisbon
first
thing
in
the
mullins
bowed
venerable
as
an
archdeacon
in
aspect
and
bearing
as
he
received
the
letter
from
his
master
certainly
sir
as
he
departed
sir
terence
turned
and
slowly
paced
back
to
his
desk
leaving
the
door
open
his
eyes
had
narrowed
there
was
a
cruel
an
almost
evil
smile
on
his
lips
of
the
generous
nature
imprinted
upon
his
face
every
sign
had
vanished
his
countenance
was
a
mask
of
ferocity
restrained
by
intelligence
cold
and
calculating
oh
he
would
pay
the
score
that
lay
between
himself
and
those
two
who
had
betrayed
him
they
should
receive
treachery
for
treachery
mockery
for
mockery
and
for
dishonour
death
they
had
deemed
him
an
old
fool
what
was
the
expression
that
samoval
had
used
pantaloon
in
the
comedy
well
well
he
had
been
pantaloon
in
the
comedy
so
far
but
now
they
should
find
him
pantaloon
in
the
tragedy
nay
not
pantaloon
at
all
but
polichinelle
the
sinister
jester
the
cynical
clown
who
laughs
in
murdering
and
in
anguished
silence
should
they
bear
the
punishment
he
would
mete
out
to
them
or
else
in
no
less
anguished
speech
themselves
proclaim
their
own
dastardy
to
the
world
his
wife
he
beheld
now
in
a
new
light
it
was
out
of
vanity
and
greed
that
she
had
married
him
because
of
the
position
in
the
world
that
he
could
give
her
having
done
so
at
least
she
might
have
kept
faith
she
might
have
been
honest
and
abided
by
the
bargain
if
she
had
not
done
so
it
was
because
honesty
was
beyond
her
shallow
nature
he
should
have
seen
before
what
he
now
saw
so
clearly
he
should
have
known
her
for
a
lovely
empty
husk
a
silly
fluttering
butterfly
a
toy
a
thing
of
vanities
emotions
and
nothing
else
thus
sir
terence
cursing
the
day
when
he
had
mated
with
a
fool
thus
sir
terence
whilst
he
stood
there
waiting
for
the
outcry
from
mullins
that
should
proclaim
the
discovery
of
the
body
and
afford
him
a
pretext
for
having
the
house
searched
for
the
slayer
nor
had
he
long
to
wait
sir
terence
sir
terence
for
god
s
sake
sir
terence
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
old
servant
came
the
loud
crash
of
the
door
thrust
back
until
it
struck
the
wall
and
quick
steps
along
the
passage
sir
terence
stepped
out
to
meet
him
why
what
the
devil
he
was
beginning
in
his
bluff
normal
tones
when
the
servant
showing
a
white
scared
face
cut
him
short
a
terrible
thing
sir
terence
oh
the
saints
protect
us
a
dreadful
thing
this
way
sir
there
s
a
man
killed
count
samoval
i
think
it
is
what
where
out
yonder
in
the
quadrangle
but
sir
terence
checked
count
samoval
did
ye
say
impossible
and
he
went
out
quickly
followed
by
the
butler
in
the
quadrangle
he
checked
in
the
few
minutes
that
were
sped
since
he
had
left
the
place
the
moon
had
overtopped
the
roof
of
the
opposite
wing
so
that
full
upon
the
enclosed
garden
fell
now
its
white
light
illumining
and
revealing
there
lay
the
black
still
form
of
samoval
supine
his
white
face
staring
up
into
the
heavens
and
beside
him
knelt
tremayne
whilst
in
the
balcony
above
leaned
her
ladyship
the
rope
ladder
sir
terence
s
swift
glance
observed
had
disappeared
he
halted
in
his
advance
standing
at
gaze
a
moment
he
had
hardly
expected
so
much
he
had
conceived
the
plan
of
causing
the
house
to
be
searched
immediately
upon
mullins
s
discovery
of
the
body
but
tremayne
s
rashness
in
adventuring
down
in
this
fashion
spared
him
even
that
necessity
true
it
set
up
other
difficulties
but
he
was
not
sure
that
the
matter
would
not
be
infinitely
more
interesting
thus
he
stepped
forward
and
came
to
a
standstill
beside
the
two
his
dead
enemy
and
his
living
one
chapter
xiii
polichinelle
why
ned
he
asked
gravely
what
has
happened
it
is
samoval
was
tremayne
s
quiet
answer
he
is
quite
he
stood
up
as
he
spoke
and
sir
terence
observed
with
terrible
inward
mirth
that
his
tone
had
the
frank
and
honest
ring
his
bearing
the
imperturbable
ease
which
more
than
once
before
had
imposed
upon
him
as
the
outward
signs
of
an
easy
conscience
this
secretary
of
his
was
a
cool
scoundrel
samoval
is
it
said
sir
terence
and
went
down
on
one
knee
beside
the
body
to
make
a
perfunctory
examination
then
he
looked
up
at
the
captain
and
how
did
this
happen
happen
echoed
tremayne
realising
that
the
question
was
being
addressed
particularly
to
himself
that
is
what
i
am
wondering
i
found
him
here
in
this
you
found
him
here
oh
you
found
him
here
in
this
condition
curious
over
his
shoulder
he
spoke
to
the
butler
mullins
you
had
better
call
the
he
picked
up
the
slender
weapon
that
lay
beside
samoval
a
duelling
sword
then
he
looked
searchingly
about
him
until
his
eyes
caught
the
gleam
of
the
other
blade
near
the
wall
where
himself
he
had
dropped
it
ah
he
said
and
went
to
pick
it
up
very
odd
he
looked
up
at
the
balcony
over
the
parapet
of
which
his
wife
was
leaning
did
you
see
anything
my
dear
he
asked
and
neither
tremayne
nor
she
detected
the
faint
note
of
wicked
mockery
in
the
question
there
was
a
moment
s
pause
before
she
answered
him
faltering
i
saw
sir
terence
s
straining
ears
caught
no
faintest
sound
of
the
voice
that
had
prompted
her
urgently
from
behind
the
curtained
windows
how
long
have
you
been
there
he
asked
her
a
a
moment
only
she
replied
again
after
a
pause
i
i
thought
i
heard
a
cry
and
and
i
came
to
see
what
had
her
voice
shook
with
terror
but
what
she
beheld
would
have
been
quite
enough
to
account
for
that
the
guard
filed
in
through
the
doors
from
the
official
quarters
a
sergeant
with
a
halbert
in
one
hand
and
a
lantern
in
the
other
followed
by
four
men
and
lastly
by
mullins
they
halted
and
came
to
attention
before
sir
terence
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
there
was
a
sharp
rattling
knock
on
the
wicket
in
the
great
closed
gates
through
which
samoval
had
entered
startled
but
without
showing
any
signs
of
it
sir
terence
bade
mullins
go
open
and
in
a
general
silence
all
waited
to
see
who
it
was
that
came
a
tall
man
bowing
his
shoulders
to
pass
under
the
low
lintel
of
that
narrow
door
stepped
over
the
sill
and
into
the
courtyard
he
wore
a
cocked
hat
and
as
his
great
cavalry
cloak
fell
open
the
yellow
rays
of
the
sergeant
s
lantern
gleamed
faintly
on
a
british
uniform
presently
as
he
advanced
into
the
quadrangle
he
disclosed
the
aquiline
features
of
colquhoun
grant
general
tremayne
he
greeted
one
and
the
other
then
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
body
lying
between
them
samoval
eh
so
i
am
not
mistaken
in
seeking
him
here
i
have
had
him
under
very
close
observation
during
the
past
day
or
two
and
when
one
of
my
men
brought
me
word
tonight
that
he
had
left
his
place
at
bispo
on
foot
and
alone
going
along
the
upper
alcantara
road
if
had
a
notion
that
he
might
be
coming
to
monsanto
and
i
followed
but
i
hardly
expected
to
find
this
how
has
it
happened
that
is
what
i
was
just
asking
tremayne
replied
sir
terence
mullins
discovered
him
here
quite
by
chance
with
the
oh
said
grant
and
turned
to
the
captain
was
it
you
then
i
interrupted
tremayne
with
sudden
violence
he
seemed
now
to
become
aware
for
the
first
time
of
the
gravity
of
his
position
certainly
not
colonel
grant
i
heard
a
cry
and
i
came
out
to
see
what
it
was
i
found
samoval
here
already
i
see
said
grant
you
were
with
sir
terence
then
when
this
nay
sir
terence
interrupted
i
have
been
alone
since
dinner
clearing
up
some
arrears
of
work
i
was
in
my
study
there
when
mullins
called
me
to
tell
me
what
he
had
discovered
it
looks
as
if
there
had
been
a
duel
look
at
these
then
he
turned
to
his
secretary
i
think
captain
tremayne
he
said
gravely
that
you
had
better
report
yourself
under
arrest
to
your
tremayne
stiffened
suddenly
report
myself
under
arrest
he
cried
my
god
sir
terence
you
don
t
believe
that
i
sir
terence
interrupted
him
the
voice
in
which
he
spoke
was
stern
almost
sad
but
his
eyes
gleamed
with
fiendish
mockery
the
while
it
was
polichinelle
that
spoke
polichinelle
that
mocks
what
time
he
slays
what
were
you
doing
here
he
asked
and
it
was
like
moving
the
checkmating
piece
tremayne
stood
stricken
and
silent
he
cast
a
desperate
upward
glance
at
the
balcony
overhead
the
answer
was
so
easy
but
it
would
entail
delivering
richard
butler
to
his
death
colonel
grant
following
his
upward
glance
beheld
lady
o
moy
for
the
first
time
he
bowed
swept
off
his
cocked
hat
and
perhaps
her
ladyship
he
suggested
to
sir
terence
may
have
seen
i
have
already
asked
her
replied
o
moy
and
then
she
herself
was
feverishly
assuring
colonel
grant
that
she
had
seen
nothing
at
all
that
she
had
heard
a
cry
and
had
come
out
on
to
the
balcony
to
see
what
was
happening
and
was
captain
tremayne
here
when
you
came
out
asked
o
moy
the
deadly
jester
she
faltered
i
was
only
a
moment
or
two
before
you
see
said
sir
terence
heavily
to
grant
and
grant
with
pursed
lips
nodded
his
eyes
moving
from
o
moy
to
tremayne
but
sir
terence
cried
tremayne
i
give
you
my
word
i
swear
to
you
that
i
know
absolutely
nothing
of
how
samoval
met
his
what
were
you
doing
here
o
moy
asked
again
and
this
time
the
sinister
menacing
note
of
derision
vibrated
clearly
in
the
question
tremayne
for
the
first
time
in
his
honest
upright
life
found
himself
deliberately
choosing
between
truth
and
falsehood
the
truth
would
clear
him
since
with
that
truth
he
would
produce
witnesses
to
it
establishing
his
movements
completely
but
the
truth
would
send
a
man
to
his
death
and
so
for
the
sake
of
that
man
s
life
he
was
driven
into
falsehood
i
was
on
my
way
to
see
you
he
said
at
midnight
cried
sir
terence
on
a
note
of
grim
doubt
to
what
purpose
really
sir
terence
if
my
word
is
not
sufficient
i
refuse
to
submit
to
sir
terence
turned
to
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
how
long
is
it
since
captain
tremayne
arrived
he
asked
the
sergeant
stood
to
attention
captain
tremayne
sir
arrived
rather
more
than
ago
he
came
in
a
curricle
which
is
still
waiting
at
the
ago
eh
said
sir
terence
and
from
colquhoun
grant
there
was
a
sharp
and
audible
intake
of
breath
expressive
either
of
understanding
or
surprise
or
both
the
adjutant
looked
at
tremayne
again
as
my
questions
seem
only
to
entangle
you
further
he
said
i
think
you
had
better
do
as
i
suggest
without
more
protests
report
yourself
under
arrest
to
colonel
fletcher
in
the
morning
still
tremayne
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
drawing
himself
up
he
saluted
curtly
very
well
sir
he
replied
but
terence
cried
her
ladyship
from
above
ah
said
sir
terence
and
he
looked
up
you
would
say
he
encouraged
her
for
she
had
broken
off
abruptly
checked
again
although
none
below
could
guess
it
by
the
one
behind
who
prompted
her
couldn
t
you
couldn
t
you
wait
she
was
faltering
compelled
to
it
by
his
question
certainly
but
for
what
quoth
he
grimly
sardonic
wait
until
you
have
some
explanation
she
concluded
lamely
that
will
be
the
business
of
the
he
answered
my
duty
is
quite
clear
and
simple
i
think
you
needn
t
wait
captain
and
so
without
another
word
tremayne
turned
and
departed
the
soldiers
in
compliance
with
the
short
command
issued
by
sir
terence
took
up
the
body
and
bore
it
away
to
a
room
in
the
official
quarters
and
in
their
wake
went
colonel
grant
after
taking
his
leave
of
sir
terence
her
ladyship
vanished
from
the
balcony
and
closed
her
windows
and
finally
sir
terence
followed
by
mullins
slowly
with
bowed
head
and
dragging
steps
reentered
the
house
in
the
quadrangle
flooded
now
by
the
cold
white
light
of
the
moon
all
was
peace
once
more
sir
terence
turned
into
his
study
sank
into
the
chair
by
his
desk
and
sat
there
awhile
staring
into
vacancy
a
diabolical
smile
upon
his
handsome
mobile
mouth
gradually
the
smile
faded
and
horror
overspread
his
face
finally
he
flung
himself
forward
and
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
there
were
steps
in
the
hall
outside
a
quick
mutter
of
voices
and
then
the
door
of
his
study
was
flung
open
and
miss
armytage
came
sharply
to
rouse
him
terence
what
has
happened
to
captain
tremayne
he
sat
up
stiffly
as
she
sped
across
the
room
to
him
she
was
wrapped
in
a
blue
quilted
her
dark
hair
hung
in
two
heavy
plaits
and
her
bare
feet
had
been
hastily
thrust
into
slippers
sir
terence
looked
at
her
with
eyes
that
were
dull
and
heavy
and
that
yet
seemed
to
search
her
white
startled
face
she
set
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
down
into
his
ravaged
haggard
countenance
he
seemed
suddenly
to
have
been
stricken
into
an
old
man
mullins
has
just
told
me
that
captain
tremayne
has
been
ordered
under
arrest
for
for
killing
count
samoval
is
it
true
is
it
true
she
demanded
wildly
it
is
true
he
answered
her
and
there
was
a
heavy
sneering
curl
on
his
upper
lip
but
she
stopped
and
put
a
hand
to
her
throat
she
looked
as
if
she
would
stifle
she
sank
to
her
knees
beside
him
and
caught
his
hand
in
both
her
own
that
were
trembling
oh
you
can
t
believe
it
captain
tremayne
is
not
the
man
to
do
a
the
evidence
points
to
a
duel
he
answered
dully
a
duel
she
looked
at
him
and
then
remembering
what
had
passed
that
morning
between
tremayne
and
samoval
remembering
too
lord
wellington
s
edict
oh
god
she
gasped
why
did
you
let
them
take
him
they
didn
t
take
him
i
ordered
him
under
arrest
he
will
report
himself
to
colonel
fletcher
in
the
you
ordered
him
you
you
his
friend
anger
scorn
reproach
and
sorrow
all
blending
in
her
voice
bore
him
a
clear
message
he
looked
down
at
her
most
closely
and
gradually
compassion
crept
into
his
face
he
set
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
she
suffering
it
passively
insensibly
you
care
for
him
sylvia
he
said
between
inquiry
and
wonder
well
well
we
are
both
fools
together
child
the
man
is
a
dastard
a
blackguard
a
judas
to
be
repaid
with
betrayal
for
betrayal
forget
him
girl
believe
me
he
isn
t
worth
a
terence
she
looked
in
her
turn
into
that
distorted
face
are
you
mad
she
asked
him
very
nearly
he
answered
with
a
laugh
that
was
horrible
to
hear
she
drew
back
and
away
from
him
bewildered
and
horrified
slowly
she
rose
to
her
feet
she
controlled
with
difficulty
the
deep
emotion
swaying
her
tell
me
she
said
slowly
speaking
with
obvious
effort
what
will
they
do
to
captain
tremayne
what
will
they
do
to
him
he
looked
at
her
he
was
smiling
they
will
shoot
him
of
and
you
wish
it
she
denounced
him
in
a
whisper
of
horror
above
all
things
he
answered
a
more
poetic
justice
never
overtook
a
why
do
you
call
him
that
what
do
you
mean
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
after
they
have
shot
him
unless
the
truth
comes
out
what
truth
do
you
mean
the
truth
of
how
samoval
came
by
his
death
oh
no
that
matter
is
quite
clear
the
evidence
complete
i
mean
oh
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
what
i
mean
it
may
help
you
to
bear
your
trouble
she
approached
him
again
won
t
you
tell
me
now
she
begged
him
no
he
answered
rising
and
speaking
with
finality
afterwards
if
necessary
afterwards
and
now
get
back
to
bed
child
and
forget
the
fellow
i
swear
to
you
that
he
isn
t
worth
a
thought
later
i
shall
hope
to
prove
it
to
that
you
never
will
she
told
him
fiercely
he
laughed
and
again
his
laugh
was
harsh
and
terrible
in
its
bitter
mockery
yet
another
trusting
fool
he
cried
the
world
is
full
of
them
it
is
made
up
of
them
with
just
a
sprinkling
of
knaves
to
batten
on
their
folly
go
to
bed
sylvia
and
pray
for
understanding
of
men
it
is
a
possession
beyond
i
think
you
are
more
in
need
of
it
than
i
am
she
told
him
standing
by
the
door
of
course
you
do
you
trust
which
is
why
you
are
a
fool
trust
he
said
speaking
the
very
language
of
polichinelle
is
the
livery
of
she
went
without
answering
him
and
toiled
upstairs
with
dragging
feet
she
paused
a
moment
in
the
corridor
above
outside
una
s
door
she
was
in
such
need
of
communion
with
some
one
that
for
a
moment
she
thought
of
going
in
but
she
knew
beforehand
the
greeting
that
would
await
her
the
empty
platitudes
the
obvious
small
change
of
verbiage
which
her
ladyship
would
dole
out
the
very
thought
of
it
restrained
her
and
so
she
passed
on
to
her
own
room
and
a
sleepless
night
in
which
to
piece
together
the
puzzle
which
the
situation
offered
her
the
amazing
enigma
of
sir
terence
s
seeming
access
of
insanity
and
the
only
conclusion
that
she
reached
was
that
intertwined
with
the
death
of
samoval
there
was
some
other
circumstance
which
had
aroused
in
the
adjutant
an
unreasoning
hatred
of
his
friend
converting
him
into
tremayne
s
bitterest
enemy
intent
as
he
had
confessed
upon
seeing
him
shot
for
that
night
s
work
and
because
she
knew
them
both
for
men
of
honour
above
all
the
enigma
was
immeasurably
deepened
had
she
but
obeyed
the
transient
impulse
to
seek
lady
o
moy
she
might
have
discovered
all
the
truth
at
once
for
she
would
have
come
upon
her
ladyship
in
a
frame
of
mind
almost
as
distraught
as
her
own
and
she
might
had
she
penetrated
to
the
where
her
ladyship
was
have
come
upon
richard
butler
at
the
same
time
now
in
view
of
what
had
happened
her
ladyship
ever
impulsive
was
all
for
going
there
and
then
to
her
husband
to
confess
the
whole
truth
without
pausing
to
reflect
upon
the
consequences
to
others
than
ned
tremayne
as
you
know
it
was
beyond
her
to
see
a
thing
from
two
points
of
view
at
one
and
the
same
time
it
was
also
beyond
her
brother
the
failing
as
i
think
i
have
told
you
was
a
family
one
and
her
brother
saw
this
matter
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
own
safety
a
single
word
to
terence
he
had
told
her
putting
his
back
to
the
door
of
the
to
bar
her
intended
egress
and
you
realise
that
it
will
be
a
and
a
firing
party
for
that
warning
effectively
checked
her
yet
certain
stirrings
of
conscience
made
her
think
of
the
man
who
had
imperilled
himself
for
her
sake
and
her
brother
s
but
dick
what
is
to
become
of
ned
she
had
asked
him
oh
ned
will
be
all
right
what
is
the
evidence
against
him
after
all
men
are
not
shot
for
things
they
haven
t
done
justice
will
out
you
know
leave
ned
to
shift
for
himself
for
the
present
anyhow
his
danger
isn
t
grave
nor
is
it
immediate
and
mine
helplessly
distraught
she
sank
to
an
ottoman
the
night
had
been
a
very
trying
one
for
her
ladyship
she
gave
way
to
tears
it
is
all
your
fault
dick
she
reproached
him
naturally
you
would
blame
me
he
said
with
resignation
the
complete
martyr
if
only
you
had
been
ready
at
the
time
as
he
told
you
to
be
there
would
have
been
no
delays
and
you
would
have
got
away
before
any
of
this
was
it
my
fault
that
i
should
have
reopened
my
wound
bad
luck
to
it
in
attempting
to
get
down
that
damned
ladder
he
asked
her
is
it
my
fault
that
i
am
neither
an
ape
nor
an
acrobat
tremayne
should
have
come
up
at
once
to
assist
me
instead
of
waiting
until
he
had
to
come
up
to
help
me
bandage
my
leg
again
then
time
would
not
have
been
lost
and
very
likely
my
life
with
he
came
to
a
gloomy
conclusion
your
life
what
do
you
mean
dick
just
that
what
are
my
chances
of
getting
away
now
he
asked
her
was
there
ever
such
infernal
luck
as
mine
the
telemachus
will
sail
without
me
and
the
only
man
who
could
and
would
have
helped
me
to
get
out
of
this
damned
country
is
under
arrest
it
s
clear
i
shall
have
to
shift
for
myself
again
and
i
can
t
even
do
that
for
a
day
or
two
with
my
leg
in
this
state
i
shall
have
to
go
back
into
that
stuffy
of
yours
till
god
knows
he
lost
all
at
the
prospect
and
broke
into
imprecations
of
his
luck
she
attempted
to
soothe
him
but
he
wasn
t
easy
to
soothe
and
then
he
grumbled
on
you
have
so
little
sense
that
you
want
to
run
straight
off
to
terence
and
explain
to
him
what
tremayne
was
doing
here
you
might
at
least
have
the
grace
to
wait
until
i
am
off
the
premises
and
give
me
the
mercy
of
a
start
before
you
set
the
dogs
on
my
oh
dick
dick
you
are
so
cruel
she
protested
how
can
you
say
such
things
to
me
whose
only
thought
is
for
you
to
save
then
don
t
talk
any
more
about
telling
terence
he
replied
i
won
t
dick
i
won
she
drew
him
down
beside
her
on
the
ottoman
and
her
fingers
smoothed
his
rather
tumbled
red
hair
just
as
her
words
attempted
to
smooth
the
ruffles
in
his
spirit
you
know
i
didn
t
realise
or
i
should
not
have
thought
of
it
even
i
was
so
concerned
for
ned
for
the
don
t
i
tell
you
there
s
not
the
need
he
assured
her
ned
will
be
safe
enough
devil
a
doubt
it
s
for
you
to
keep
to
what
you
told
them
from
the
balcony
that
you
heard
a
cry
went
out
to
see
what
was
happening
and
saw
tremayne
there
bending
over
the
body
not
a
word
more
and
not
a
word
less
or
it
will
be
all
over
with
chapter
xiv
the
champion
with
the
possible
exception
of
her
ladyship
i
do
not
think
that
there
was
much
sleep
that
night
at
monsanto
for
any
of
the
four
chief
actors
in
this
tragicomedy
each
had
his
own
preoccupations
sylvia
s
we
know
butler
found
his
leg
troubling
him
again
and
the
pain
of
the
reopened
wound
must
have
prevented
him
from
sleeping
even
had
his
anxieties
about
his
immediate
future
not
sufficed
to
do
so
as
for
sir
terence
his
was
the
most
deplorable
case
of
all
this
man
who
had
lived
a
life
of
simple
and
downright
honesty
in
great
things
and
in
small
a
man
who
had
never
stooped
to
the
slightest
prevarication
found
himself
suddenly
launched
upon
the
most
horrible
and
infamous
course
of
duplicity
to
encompass
the
ruin
of
another
the
offence
of
that
other
against
himself
might
be
of
the
most
foul
and
hideous
a
piece
of
treachery
that
only
treachery
could
adequately
avenge
yet
this
consideration
was
not
enough
to
appease
the
clamours
of
sir
terence
s
in
the
end
however
the
primary
desire
for
vengeance
and
vengeance
of
the
bitterest
kind
proved
master
of
his
mind
captain
tremayne
had
been
led
by
his
villainy
into
a
coil
that
should
presently
crush
him
and
sir
terence
promised
himself
an
infinite
balm
for
his
outraged
honour
in
the
entertainment
which
the
futile
struggles
of
the
victim
should
provide
with
captain
tremayne
lay
the
cruel
choice
of
submitting
in
tortured
silence
to
his
fate
or
of
turning
craven
and
saving
his
miserable
life
by
proclaiming
himself
a
seducer
and
a
betrayer
it
should
be
interesting
to
observe
how
the
captain
would
decide
and
his
punishment
was
certain
whatever
the
decision
that
he
took
sir
terence
came
to
breakfast
in
the
open
and
haggard
but
miraculously
composed
for
a
man
who
had
so
little
studied
the
art
of
concealing
his
emotions
voice
and
glance
were
calm
as
he
gave
a
to
his
wife
and
to
miss
armytage
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
ned
was
one
of
his
wife
s
first
questions
it
took
him
aback
he
looked
askance
at
her
marvelling
at
the
steadiness
with
which
she
bore
his
glance
until
it
occurred
to
him
that
effrontery
was
an
essential
part
of
the
equipment
of
all
harlots
what
am
i
going
to
do
he
echoed
why
nothing
the
matter
is
out
of
my
hands
i
may
be
asked
to
give
evidence
i
may
even
be
called
to
sit
upon
the
that
will
try
him
my
evidence
can
hardly
assist
him
my
conclusions
will
naturally
be
based
upon
the
evidence
that
is
laid
before
the
her
teaspoon
rattled
in
her
saucer
i
don
t
understand
you
terence
ned
has
always
been
your
best
he
has
certainly
shared
everything
that
was
and
you
know
she
went
on
that
he
did
not
kill
indeed
his
glance
quickened
a
little
how
should
i
know
that
well
i
know
it
he
seemed
moved
by
that
statement
he
leaned
forward
with
an
odd
eagerness
behind
which
there
was
something
terrible
that
went
unperceived
by
her
why
did
you
not
say
so
before
how
do
you
know
what
do
you
know
i
am
sure
that
he
did
yes
yes
but
what
makes
you
so
sure
do
you
possess
some
knowledge
that
you
have
not
revealed
he
saw
the
colour
slowly
shrinking
from
her
cheeks
under
his
burning
gaze
so
she
was
not
quite
shameless
then
after
all
there
were
limits
to
her
effrontery
what
knowledge
should
i
possess
she
filtered
that
is
what
i
am
she
made
a
good
recovery
i
possess
the
knowledge
that
you
should
possess
yourself
she
told
him
i
know
ned
for
a
man
incapable
of
such
a
thing
i
am
ready
to
swear
that
he
could
not
have
done
i
see
evidence
as
to
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
and
thoughtfully
stirred
his
chocolate
it
may
weigh
with
the
court
but
i
am
not
the
court
and
my
mere
opinions
can
do
nothing
for
ned
her
ladyship
looked
at
him
wildly
the
court
she
cried
do
you
mean
that
i
shall
have
to
give
evidence
naturally
he
answered
you
will
have
to
say
what
you
but
but
i
saw
something
i
yes
but
nothing
that
can
still
the
court
will
wish
to
hear
it
and
perhaps
to
examine
you
upon
oh
no
no
in
her
alarm
she
half
rose
then
sank
again
to
her
chair
you
must
keep
me
out
of
this
terence
i
couldn
t
i
really
couldn
he
laughed
with
an
affectation
of
indulgence
masking
something
else
why
he
said
you
would
not
deprive
tremayne
of
any
of
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
your
testimony
are
you
not
ready
to
bear
witness
as
to
his
character
to
swear
that
from
your
knowledge
of
the
man
you
are
sure
he
could
not
have
done
such
a
thing
that
he
is
the
very
soul
of
honour
a
man
incapable
of
anything
base
or
treacherous
or
sly
and
then
at
last
sylvia
who
had
been
watching
them
and
seeking
to
apply
to
what
she
heard
the
wild
expressions
that
sir
terence
had
used
to
herself
last
night
broke
into
the
conversation
why
do
you
apply
these
words
to
captain
tremayne
she
asked
he
turned
sharply
to
meet
the
opposition
he
detected
in
her
i
don
t
apply
them
on
the
contrary
i
say
that
as
una
knows
they
are
not
then
you
make
an
unnecessary
statement
a
statement
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
captain
tremayne
has
been
arrested
for
killing
count
samoval
in
a
duel
a
duel
may
be
a
violation
of
the
law
as
recently
enacted
by
lord
wellington
but
it
is
not
an
offence
against
honour
and
to
say
that
a
man
can
not
have
fought
a
duel
because
a
man
is
incapable
of
anything
base
or
treacherous
or
sly
is
just
to
say
a
very
foolish
and
meaningless
oh
quite
so
the
adjutant
admitted
but
if
tremayne
denies
having
fought
if
he
shelters
himself
behind
a
falsehood
and
says
that
he
has
not
killed
samoval
then
i
think
the
statement
assumes
some
does
captain
tremayne
say
that
she
asked
him
sharply
it
is
what
i
understood
him
to
say
last
night
when
i
ordered
him
under
then
said
sylvia
with
full
conviction
captain
tremayne
did
not
do
perhaps
he
didn
t
sir
terence
admitted
the
court
will
no
doubt
discover
the
truth
the
truth
you
know
must
prevail
and
he
looked
at
his
wife
again
marking
the
fresh
signs
of
agitation
she
betrayed
mullins
coming
to
set
fresh
covers
the
conversation
was
allowed
to
lapse
nor
was
it
ever
resumed
for
at
that
moment
with
no
other
announcement
save
such
as
was
afforded
by
his
quick
step
and
the
of
his
spurs
a
short
slight
man
entered
the
quadrangle
from
the
doorway
of
the
official
wing
the
adjutant
turning
to
look
caught
his
breath
suddenly
in
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
lord
wellington
he
cried
and
was
immediately
on
his
feet
at
the
exclamation
the
checked
and
turned
he
wore
a
plain
grey
undress
frock
and
white
stock
buckskin
breeches
and
lacquered
boots
and
he
carried
a
tucked
under
his
left
arm
his
features
were
bold
and
sternly
handsome
his
fine
eyes
singularly
piercing
and
keen
in
their
glance
and
the
sweep
of
those
eyes
now
took
in
not
merely
the
adjutant
but
the
spread
table
and
the
ladies
seated
before
it
he
halted
a
moment
then
advanced
quickly
swept
his
cocked
hat
from
a
brown
head
that
was
but
very
slightly
touched
with
grey
and
bowed
with
a
mixture
of
stiffness
and
courtliness
to
the
ladies
since
i
have
intruded
so
unwittingly
i
had
best
remain
to
make
my
apologies
he
said
i
was
on
my
way
to
your
residential
quarters
o
moy
not
imagining
that
i
should
break
in
upon
your
privacy
in
this
o
moy
with
a
great
deference
made
haste
to
reassure
him
on
the
score
of
the
intrusion
whilst
the
ladies
themselves
rose
to
greet
him
he
bore
her
ladyship
s
hand
to
his
lips
with
perfunctory
courtesy
then
insisted
upon
her
resuming
her
chair
then
he
bowed
ever
with
that
mixture
of
stiffness
and
deference
to
miss
armytage
upon
her
being
presented
to
him
by
the
adjutant
do
not
suffer
me
to
disturb
you
he
begged
them
sit
down
o
moy
i
am
not
pressed
and
i
shall
be
monstrous
glad
of
a
few
moments
rest
you
are
very
pleasant
here
and
he
looked
about
the
luxuriant
garden
with
approving
eyes
sir
terence
placed
the
hospitality
of
his
table
at
his
lordship
s
disposal
but
the
latter
declined
graciously
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
if
you
will
no
more
i
breakfasted
at
torres
vedras
with
then
to
the
look
of
astonishment
on
the
faces
of
the
ladies
he
smiled
oh
yes
he
assured
them
i
was
early
astir
for
time
is
very
precious
just
at
present
which
is
why
i
drop
unannounced
upon
you
from
the
skies
o
he
took
the
glass
that
mullins
proffered
on
a
salver
sipped
from
it
and
set
it
down
there
is
so
much
vexation
so
much
hindrance
from
these
pestilential
intriguers
here
in
lisbon
that
i
have
thought
it
as
well
to
come
in
person
and
speak
plainly
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
council
of
he
was
peeling
off
his
stout
as
he
spoke
if
this
campaign
is
to
go
forward
at
all
it
will
go
forward
as
i
dispose
then
too
i
wanted
to
see
fletcher
and
the
works
by
gad
o
moy
he
has
performed
miracles
and
i
am
very
pleased
with
him
oh
and
with
you
too
he
told
me
how
ably
you
have
seconded
him
and
counselled
him
where
necessary
you
must
have
worked
night
and
day
o
he
sighed
i
wish
that
i
were
as
well
served
in
every
and
then
he
broke
off
abruptly
but
this
is
monstrous
tedious
for
your
ladyship
and
for
you
miss
armytage
forgive
her
ladyship
protested
the
contrary
professing
a
deep
interest
in
military
matters
and
inviting
his
lordship
to
continue
lord
wellington
however
ignoring
the
invitation
turned
the
conversation
upon
life
in
lisbon
inquiring
hopefully
whether
they
found
the
place
afforded
them
adequate
entertainment
indeed
yes
lady
o
moy
assured
him
we
are
very
gay
at
times
there
are
private
theatricals
and
dances
occasionally
an
official
ball
and
we
are
promised
picnics
and
now
that
the
summer
is
and
in
the
autumn
ma
am
we
may
find
you
a
little
hunting
his
lordship
promised
them
plenty
of
foxes
a
rough
country
though
but
what
s
that
to
an
irishwoman
he
caught
the
quickening
of
miss
armytage
s
eye
the
prospect
interests
you
i
miss
armytage
admitted
it
and
thus
they
made
conversation
for
a
while
what
time
the
great
soldier
sipped
his
wine
and
water
to
wash
the
dust
of
his
morning
ride
from
his
throat
when
at
last
he
set
down
an
empty
glass
sir
terence
took
this
as
the
intimation
of
his
readiness
to
deal
with
official
matters
and
rising
he
announced
himself
entirely
at
his
lordship
s
service
lord
wellington
claimed
his
attention
for
a
full
hour
with
the
details
of
several
matters
that
are
not
immediately
concerned
with
this
narrative
having
done
he
rose
at
last
from
sir
terence
s
desk
at
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
took
up
his
and
cocked
hat
from
the
chair
where
he
had
placed
them
and
now
he
said
i
think
i
will
ride
into
lisbon
and
endeavour
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
count
redondo
and
don
miguel
sir
terence
advanced
to
open
the
door
but
wellington
checked
him
with
a
sudden
sharp
inquiry
you
published
my
order
against
duelling
did
you
not
immediately
upon
receiving
it
ha
it
doesn
t
seem
to
have
taken
long
for
the
order
to
be
infringed
his
manner
was
severe
his
eyes
stern
sir
terence
was
conscious
of
a
quickening
of
his
pulses
nevertheless
his
answer
was
calmly
regretful
i
am
afraid
the
great
man
nodded
disgraceful
i
heard
of
it
from
fletcher
this
morning
captain
what
had
just
reported
himself
under
arrest
i
understand
and
fletcher
had
received
a
note
from
you
giving
the
grounds
for
this
the
deplorable
part
of
these
things
is
that
they
always
happen
in
the
most
troublesome
manner
conceivable
in
berkeley
s
case
the
victim
was
a
nephew
of
the
patriarch
s
samoval
now
was
a
person
of
even
greater
consequence
a
close
friend
of
several
members
of
the
council
his
death
will
be
deeply
resented
and
may
set
up
fresh
difficulties
it
is
monstrous
and
abruptly
he
asked
what
did
they
quarrel
about
o
moy
trembled
and
his
glance
avoided
the
other
s
gimlet
eye
the
only
quarrel
that
i
am
aware
of
between
them
he
said
was
concerned
with
this
very
enactment
of
your
lordship
s
samoval
proclaimed
it
infamous
and
tremayne
resented
the
term
hot
words
passed
between
them
but
the
altercation
was
allowed
to
go
no
further
at
the
time
by
myself
and
others
who
were
his
lordship
had
raised
his
brows
by
gad
sir
he
ejaculated
there
almost
appears
to
be
some
justification
for
the
captain
he
was
one
of
your
military
secretaries
was
he
not
he
ha
pity
pity
his
lordship
was
thoughtful
for
a
moment
then
he
dismissed
the
matter
but
then
orders
are
orders
and
soldiers
must
learn
to
obey
implicitly
british
soldiers
of
all
degrees
seem
to
find
the
lesson
difficult
we
must
inculcate
it
more
sternly
that
is
o
moy
s
honest
soul
was
in
torturing
revolt
against
the
falsehoods
he
had
implied
and
to
this
man
of
all
men
to
this
man
whom
he
reverenced
above
all
others
who
stood
to
him
for
the
very
fount
of
military
honour
and
lofty
principle
he
was
in
such
a
mood
that
one
more
question
on
the
subject
from
wellington
and
the
whole
ghastly
truth
must
have
come
pouring
from
his
lips
but
no
other
question
came
instead
his
lordship
turned
on
the
threshold
and
held
out
his
hand
not
a
step
farther
o
moy
i
ve
left
you
a
mass
of
work
and
you
are
short
of
a
secretary
so
don
t
waste
any
of
your
time
on
courtesies
i
shall
hope
still
to
find
the
ladies
in
the
garden
so
that
i
may
take
my
leave
without
inconveniencing
and
he
was
gone
stepping
briskly
with
clicking
spurs
leaving
o
moy
hunched
now
in
his
chair
his
body
the
very
expression
of
the
dejection
that
filled
his
soul
in
the
garden
his
lordship
came
upon
miss
armytage
alone
still
seated
by
the
table
under
the
trellis
from
which
the
cloth
had
by
now
been
removed
she
rose
at
his
approach
and
in
spite
of
gesture
to
her
to
remain
seated
i
was
seeking
lady
o
moy
said
he
to
take
my
leave
of
her
i
may
not
have
the
pleasure
of
coming
to
monsanto
she
is
on
the
terrace
i
think
said
miss
armytage
i
will
find
her
for
your
let
us
find
her
together
he
said
amiably
and
so
turned
and
went
with
her
towards
the
archway
you
said
your
name
is
armytage
i
think
he
commented
sir
terence
said
his
eyes
twinkled
you
possess
an
exceptional
virtue
said
he
to
be
truthful
is
common
to
be
accurate
rare
well
then
sir
terence
said
so
once
i
had
a
great
friend
of
the
name
of
armytage
i
have
lost
sight
of
him
these
many
years
we
were
at
school
together
in
at
monsieur
goubert
s
she
surprised
him
by
saying
that
would
be
john
armytage
my
god
bless
my
soul
ma
am
he
ejaculated
but
i
gathered
you
were
irish
and
jack
armytage
came
from
my
mother
is
irish
and
we
live
in
ireland
now
i
was
born
there
but
father
none
the
less
was
john
armytage
s
he
looked
at
her
with
increased
interest
marking
the
straight
supple
lines
of
her
and
the
handsome
face
his
lordship
remember
never
lacked
an
appreciative
eye
for
a
fine
woman
so
you
re
jack
armytage
s
niece
give
me
news
of
him
my
she
did
so
jack
armytage
was
well
and
prospering
had
made
a
rich
marriage
and
retired
from
the
blues
many
years
ago
to
live
at
northampton
he
listened
with
interest
and
thus
out
of
his
boyhood
friendship
for
her
uncle
which
of
late
years
he
had
had
no
opportunity
to
express
sprang
there
and
then
a
kindness
for
the
niece
her
own
personal
charms
may
have
contributed
to
it
for
the
great
soldier
was
intensely
responsive
to
the
appeal
of
beauty
they
reached
the
terrace
lady
o
moy
was
nowhere
in
sight
but
lord
wellington
was
too
much
engrossed
in
his
discovery
to
be
troubled
my
dear
he
said
if
i
can
serve
you
at
any
time
both
for
jack
s
sake
and
your
own
i
hope
that
you
will
let
me
know
of
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
he
saw
her
colour
come
and
go
arguing
a
sudden
agitation
you
tempt
me
sir
she
said
with
a
wistful
smile
then
yield
to
the
temptation
child
he
urged
her
kindly
those
keen
penetrating
eyes
of
his
perceiving
trouble
here
it
isn
t
for
myself
she
responded
yet
there
is
something
i
would
ask
you
if
i
dare
something
i
had
intended
to
ask
you
in
any
case
if
i
could
find
the
opportunity
to
be
frank
that
is
why
i
was
waiting
there
in
the
garden
just
now
it
was
to
waylay
you
i
hoped
for
a
word
with
well
well
he
encouraged
her
it
should
be
the
easier
now
since
in
a
sense
we
find
that
we
are
old
he
was
so
kind
so
gentle
despite
that
stern
strong
face
of
his
that
she
melted
at
once
to
his
persuasion
it
is
about
lieutenant
richard
butler
she
began
ah
said
he
lightly
i
feared
as
much
when
you
said
it
was
not
for
yourself
you
had
a
favour
to
but
looking
at
him
she
instantly
perceived
how
he
had
misunderstood
her
mr
butler
she
said
is
the
officer
who
was
guilty
of
the
affair
at
he
knit
his
brow
in
thought
he
muttered
questioningly
suddenly
his
memory
found
what
it
was
seeking
oh
yes
the
violated
his
thin
lips
tightened
the
sternness
of
his
ace
increased
yes
he
inquired
but
the
tone
was
now
forbidding
nevertheless
she
was
not
deterred
mr
butler
is
lady
o
moy
s
brother
she
said
he
stared
a
moment
taken
aback
good
god
ye
don
t
say
so
child
her
brother
o
moy
s
and
o
moy
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
it
what
should
he
say
sir
terence
himself
pledged
his
word
to
the
council
of
regency
that
butler
would
be
shot
when
did
he
egad
he
was
still
further
surprised
out
of
his
sternness
something
of
a
roman
this
o
moy
in
his
conception
of
duty
hum
the
council
no
doubt
demanded
this
so
i
understand
my
lord
lady
o
moy
realising
her
brother
s
grave
danger
is
very
deeply
naturally
he
agreed
but
what
can
i
do
miss
armytage
what
were
the
actual
facts
do
you
happen
to
know
she
recited
them
putting
the
case
bravely
for
the
scapegrace
butler
dwelling
particularly
upon
the
error
under
which
he
was
labouring
that
he
had
imagined
himself
to
be
knocking
at
the
gates
of
a
monastery
of
dominican
friars
that
he
had
broken
into
the
convent
because
denied
admittance
and
because
he
suspected
some
treacherous
reason
for
that
denial
he
heard
her
out
watching
her
with
those
keen
eyes
of
his
the
while
hum
you
make
out
so
good
a
case
for
him
that
one
might
almost
believe
you
instructed
by
the
gentleman
himself
yet
i
gather
that
nothing
has
since
been
heard
of
him
nothing
sir
since
he
vanished
from
tavora
nearly
two
months
ago
and
i
have
only
repeated
to
your
lordship
the
tale
that
was
told
by
the
sergeant
and
the
troopers
who
reported
the
matter
to
sir
robert
craufurd
on
their
he
was
very
thoughtful
leaning
on
the
balustrade
he
looked
out
across
the
sunlit
valley
turning
his
boldly
chiselled
profile
to
his
companion
at
last
he
spoke
slowly
reflectively
but
if
this
were
really
so
a
mere
blunder
i
see
no
sufficient
grounds
to
threaten
him
with
capital
punishment
his
subsequent
desertion
if
he
has
deserted
i
mean
if
nothing
has
happened
to
him
is
really
the
graver
matter
of
the
i
gathered
sir
that
he
was
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
council
of
regency
a
sort
of
he
swung
round
sharply
and
the
sudden
blaze
of
his
eyes
almost
terrified
her
instantly
he
was
cold
again
and
inscrutable
ah
you
are
oddly
well
informed
throughout
but
of
course
you
would
be
he
added
with
an
appraising
look
into
that
intelligent
face
in
which
he
now
caught
a
faint
likeness
of
jack
armytage
well
well
my
dear
i
am
very
glad
you
have
told
me
of
this
if
butler
is
ever
taken
and
in
danger
there
will
be
a
of
course
send
me
word
of
it
and
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
both
for
your
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
strict
oh
not
for
my
sake
she
protested
reddening
slightly
at
the
gentle
imputation
mr
butler
is
nothing
to
me
that
is
to
say
he
is
just
my
cousin
it
is
for
una
s
sake
that
i
am
asking
why
then
for
lady
o
moy
s
sake
since
you
ask
it
he
replied
readily
but
he
warned
her
say
nothing
of
it
until
butler
is
it
is
possible
he
believed
that
butler
never
would
be
found
and
remember
i
promise
only
to
give
the
matter
my
attention
if
it
is
as
you
represent
it
i
think
you
may
be
sure
that
the
worst
that
will
befall
butler
will
be
dismissal
from
the
service
he
deserves
that
but
i
hope
i
should
be
the
last
man
to
permit
a
british
officer
to
be
used
as
a
scapegoat
or
a
to
the
mob
or
to
any
council
of
regency
by
the
way
who
told
you
this
about
a
scapegoat
captain
captain
tremayne
oh
the
man
who
killed
samoval
he
didn
t
she
cried
on
that
almost
fierce
denial
his
lordship
looked
at
her
raising
his
eyebrows
in
astonishment
but
i
am
told
that
he
did
and
he
is
under
arrest
for
it
this
moment
for
that
and
for
breaking
my
order
against
you
were
not
told
the
truth
my
lord
captain
tremayne
says
that
he
didn
t
and
if
he
says
so
it
is
oh
of
course
miss
armytage
he
was
a
man
of
unparalleled
valour
and
boldness
yet
so
fierce
was
she
in
that
moment
that
for
the
life
of
him
he
dared
not
have
contradicted
her
captain
tremayne
is
the
most
honourable
man
i
know
she
continued
and
if
he
had
killed
samoval
he
would
never
have
denied
it
he
would
have
proclaimed
it
to
all
the
there
is
no
need
for
all
this
heat
my
dear
he
reassured
her
the
point
is
not
one
that
can
remain
in
doubt
the
seconds
of
the
duel
will
be
forthcoming
and
they
will
tell
us
who
were
the
there
were
no
seconds
she
informed
him
no
seconds
he
cried
in
horror
d
ye
mean
they
just
fought
a
rough
and
tumble
fight
i
mean
they
never
fought
at
all
as
for
this
tale
of
a
duel
i
ask
your
lordship
had
captain
tremayne
desired
a
secret
meeting
with
count
samoval
would
he
have
chosen
this
of
all
places
in
which
to
hold
it
this
this
the
fight
whoever
fought
it
took
place
in
the
quadrangle
there
at
he
was
overcome
with
astonishment
and
he
showed
it
upon
my
soul
he
said
i
do
not
appear
to
have
been
told
any
of
the
facts
strange
that
o
moy
should
never
have
mentioned
that
he
muttered
and
then
inquired
suddenly
where
was
tremayne
arrested
here
she
informed
him
here
he
was
here
then
at
midnight
what
was
he
doing
here
i
don
t
know
but
whatever
he
was
doing
can
your
lordship
believe
that
he
would
have
come
here
to
fight
a
secret
duel
it
certainly
puts
a
monstrous
strain
upon
belief
said
he
but
what
can
he
have
been
doing
here
i
don
t
know
she
repeated
she
wanted
to
add
a
warning
of
o
moy
she
was
tempted
to
tell
his
lordship
of
the
odd
words
that
o
moy
had
used
to
her
last
night
concerning
tremayne
but
she
hesitated
and
her
courage
failed
her
lord
wellington
was
so
great
a
man
bearing
the
destinies
of
nations
on
his
shoulders
and
already
he
had
wasted
upon
her
so
much
of
the
time
that
belonged
to
the
world
and
history
that
she
feared
to
trespass
further
and
whilst
she
hesitated
came
colquhoun
grant
clanking
across
the
quadrangle
looking
for
his
lordship
he
had
come
up
he
announced
standing
straight
and
stiff
before
them
to
see
o
moy
but
hearing
of
lord
wellington
s
presence
had
preferred
to
see
his
lordship
in
the
first
instance
and
indeed
you
arrive
very
opportunely
grant
his
lordship
confessed
he
turned
to
take
his
leave
of
jack
armytage
s
niece
i
ll
not
forget
either
butler
or
captain
tremayne
he
promised
her
and
his
stern
face
softened
into
a
gentle
friendly
smile
they
are
very
fortunate
in
their
chapter
xv
the
wallet
a
queer
mysterious
business
this
death
of
samoval
said
colonel
grant
so
i
was
beginning
to
perceive
wellington
agreed
his
brow
dark
they
were
alone
together
in
the
quadrangle
under
the
trellis
through
which
the
sun
already
high
was
dappling
the
table
at
which
his
lordship
sat
it
would
be
easier
to
read
if
it
were
not
for
the
duelling
swords
those
and
the
nature
of
samoval
s
wound
certainly
point
unanswerably
to
a
duel
otherwise
there
would
be
considerable
evidence
that
samoval
was
a
spy
caught
in
the
act
and
dealt
with
out
of
hand
as
he
how
count
samoval
a
spy
in
the
french
interest
answered
the
colonel
without
emotion
acting
upon
the
instructions
of
the
souza
faction
whose
tool
he
had
and
colonel
grant
proceeded
to
relate
precisely
what
he
knew
of
samoval
lord
wellington
sat
awhile
in
silence
cogitating
then
he
rose
and
his
piercing
eyes
looked
up
at
the
colonel
who
stood
a
good
head
taller
than
himself
is
this
the
evidence
of
which
you
spoke
by
no
means
was
the
answer
the
evidence
i
have
secured
is
much
more
palpable
i
have
it
he
produced
a
little
wallet
of
red
morocco
bearing
the
initial
s
surmounted
by
a
coronet
opening
it
he
selected
from
it
some
papers
speaking
the
while
i
thought
it
as
well
before
i
left
last
night
to
make
an
examination
of
the
body
this
is
what
i
found
and
it
contains
among
other
lesser
documents
these
to
which
i
would
draw
your
lordship
s
attention
first
and
he
placed
in
lord
wellington
s
hand
a
holograph
note
from
the
prince
of
esslingen
introducing
the
bearer
de
la
fleche
his
confidential
agent
who
would
consult
with
the
count
and
thanking
the
count
for
the
valuable
information
already
received
from
him
his
lordship
sat
down
again
to
read
the
letter
it
is
a
full
confirmation
of
what
you
have
told
me
he
said
calmly
then
this
said
colonel
grant
and
he
placed
upon
the
table
a
note
in
french
of
the
approximate
number
and
disposition
of
the
british
troops
in
portugal
at
the
time
the
handwriting
is
samoval
s
own
as
those
who
know
it
will
have
no
difficulty
in
discerning
and
now
this
he
unfolded
a
small
sketch
map
bearing
the
title
also
in
french
probable
position
and
extent
of
the
fortifications
north
of
lisbon
the
notes
at
the
foot
he
added
are
in
cipher
and
it
is
the
ordinary
cipher
employed
by
the
french
which
in
itself
proves
how
deeply
samoval
was
involved
here
is
a
translation
of
and
he
placed
before
his
chief
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
lord
wellington
read
this
is
based
upon
my
own
personal
knowledge
of
the
country
odd
scraps
of
information
received
from
time
to
time
and
my
personal
verification
of
the
roads
closed
to
traffic
in
that
region
it
is
intended
merely
as
a
guide
to
the
actual
locale
of
the
fortifications
an
exact
plan
of
which
i
hope
shortly
to
his
lordship
considered
it
very
attentively
but
without
betraying
the
least
discomposure
for
a
man
working
upon
such
slight
data
as
he
himself
confesses
was
the
quiet
comment
he
is
damnably
accurate
it
is
as
well
i
think
that
this
did
not
reach
marshal
my
own
assumption
is
that
he
put
off
sending
it
intending
to
replace
it
by
the
actual
plan
which
he
here
confesses
to
the
expectation
of
obtaining
i
think
he
died
at
the
right
moment
anything
else
indeed
said
colonel
grant
i
have
kept
the
best
for
the
and
unfolding
yet
another
document
he
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
the
it
was
lord
liverpool
s
note
of
the
troops
to
be
embarked
for
lisbon
in
june
and
july
the
note
abstracted
from
the
dispatch
carried
by
captain
garfield
his
lordship
s
lips
tightened
as
he
considered
it
his
death
was
timely
indeed
damned
timely
and
the
man
who
killed
him
deserves
to
be
mentioned
in
dispatches
nothing
else
i
suppose
the
rest
is
of
little
consequence
very
he
rose
you
will
leave
these
with
me
and
the
wallet
as
well
if
you
please
i
am
on
my
way
to
confer
with
the
members
of
the
council
of
regency
and
i
am
glad
to
go
armed
with
so
stout
a
weapon
as
this
whatever
may
be
the
ultimate
finding
of
the
the
present
assumption
must
be
that
samoval
met
the
death
of
a
spy
caught
in
the
act
as
you
suggested
that
is
the
only
conclusion
the
portuguese
government
can
draw
when
i
lay
these
papers
before
it
they
will
effectively
silence
all
shall
i
tell
o
moy
inquired
the
colonel
oh
certainly
answered
his
lordship
instantly
to
change
his
mind
stay
he
considered
his
chin
in
his
hand
his
eyes
dreamy
better
not
perhaps
better
not
tell
anybody
let
us
keep
this
to
ourselves
for
the
present
it
has
no
direct
bearing
on
the
matter
to
be
tried
by
the
way
when
does
the
sit
i
have
just
heard
that
marshal
beresford
has
ordered
it
to
sit
on
thursday
here
at
his
lordship
considered
perhaps
i
shall
be
present
i
may
be
at
torres
vedras
until
then
it
is
a
very
odd
affair
what
is
your
own
impression
of
it
grant
have
you
formed
any
grant
smiled
darkly
i
have
been
piecing
things
together
the
result
is
rather
curious
and
still
very
mystifying
still
leaving
a
deal
to
be
explained
and
somehow
this
wallet
doesn
t
fit
into
the
scheme
at
you
shall
tell
me
about
it
as
we
ride
into
lisbon
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
lady
o
moy
must
forgive
me
if
i
take
french
leave
since
she
is
nowhere
to
be
the
truth
was
that
her
ladyship
had
purposely
gone
into
hiding
after
the
fashion
of
suffering
animals
that
are
denied
expression
of
their
pain
she
had
gone
off
with
her
load
of
sorrow
and
anxiety
into
the
thicket
on
the
flank
of
monsanto
and
there
sylvia
found
her
presently
dejectedly
seated
by
a
spring
on
a
bank
that
was
thick
with
flowering
violets
her
ladyship
was
in
tears
her
mind
swollen
to
by
the
secret
which
it
sought
to
contain
but
felt
itself
certainly
unable
to
contain
much
longer
why
una
dear
cried
miss
armytage
kneeling
beside
her
and
putting
a
motherly
arm
about
that
child
what
is
this
her
ladyship
wept
copiously
the
springs
of
her
grief
gushing
forth
in
response
to
that
sympathetic
touch
oh
my
dear
i
am
so
distressed
i
shall
go
mad
i
think
i
am
sure
i
have
never
deserved
all
this
trouble
i
have
always
been
considerate
of
others
you
know
i
wouldn
t
give
pain
to
any
one
and
and
dick
has
always
been
so
dick
said
miss
armytage
and
there
was
less
sympathy
in
her
voice
it
is
dick
you
are
thinking
about
at
present
of
course
all
this
trouble
has
come
through
dick
i
mean
she
recovered
that
all
my
troubles
began
with
this
affair
of
dick
s
and
now
there
is
ned
under
arrest
and
to
be
but
what
has
captain
tremayne
to
do
with
dick
nothing
of
course
her
ladyship
agreed
with
more
than
usual
but
it
s
one
trouble
on
another
oh
it
s
more
than
i
can
i
know
my
dear
i
know
miss
armytage
said
soothingly
and
her
own
voice
was
not
so
steady
you
don
t
know
how
can
you
it
isn
t
your
brother
or
your
friend
it
isn
t
as
if
you
cared
very
much
for
either
of
them
if
you
did
if
you
loved
dick
or
ned
you
might
realise
what
i
am
miss
armytage
s
eyes
looked
straight
ahead
into
the
thick
green
foliage
and
there
was
an
odd
smile
half
wistful
half
scornful
on
her
lips
yet
i
have
done
what
i
could
she
said
presently
i
have
spoken
to
lord
wellington
about
them
lady
o
moy
checked
her
tears
to
look
at
her
companion
and
there
was
dread
in
her
eyes
you
have
spoken
to
lord
wellington
yes
the
opportunity
came
and
i
took
and
whatever
did
you
tell
him
she
was
all
now
as
she
clutched
miss
armytage
s
hand
miss
armytage
related
what
had
passed
how
she
had
explained
the
true
facts
of
dick
s
case
to
his
lordship
how
she
had
protested
her
faith
that
tremayne
was
incapable
of
lying
and
that
if
he
said
he
had
not
killed
samoval
it
was
certain
that
he
had
not
done
so
and
finally
how
his
lordship
had
promised
to
bear
both
cases
in
his
mind
that
doesn
t
seem
very
much
her
ladyship
complained
but
he
said
that
he
would
never
allow
a
british
officer
to
be
made
a
scapegoat
and
that
if
things
proved
to
be
as
i
stated
them
he
would
see
that
the
worst
that
happened
to
dick
would
be
his
dismissal
from
the
army
he
asked
me
to
let
him
know
immediately
if
dick
were
more
than
ever
was
her
ladyship
on
the
very
edge
of
confiding
a
chance
word
might
have
broken
down
the
last
barrier
of
her
will
but
that
word
was
not
spoken
and
so
she
was
given
the
opportunity
of
first
consulting
her
brother
he
laughed
when
he
heard
the
story
a
trap
to
take
me
that
s
all
he
pronounced
it
my
dear
girl
that
martinet
knows
nothing
of
forgiveness
for
a
military
offence
discipline
is
the
god
at
whose
shrine
he
and
he
afforded
her
anecdotes
to
illustrate
and
confirm
his
assertion
of
lord
wellington
s
ruthlessness
i
tell
you
he
concluded
it
s
nothing
but
a
trap
to
catch
me
and
if
you
had
been
fool
enough
to
yield
and
to
have
blabbed
of
my
presence
to
sylvia
you
would
have
had
it
proved
to
she
was
terrified
and
of
course
convinced
for
she
was
easy
of
conviction
believing
always
the
last
person
to
whom
she
spoke
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
boxes
that
furnished
that
cheerless
refuge
of
butler
s
then
what
s
to
become
of
ned
she
cried
oh
i
had
hoped
that
we
had
found
a
way
out
at
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
on
the
they
had
fitted
up
for
him
be
easy
now
he
bade
her
impatiently
they
can
t
do
anything
to
ned
until
they
find
him
guilty
and
how
are
they
going
to
find
him
guilty
when
he
s
innocent
yes
but
the
appearances
fiddlesticks
he
answered
her
and
the
expression
chosen
was
a
mere
concession
to
her
sex
and
not
at
all
what
butler
intended
appearances
can
t
establish
guilt
do
be
sensible
and
remember
that
they
will
have
to
prove
that
he
killed
samoval
and
you
can
t
prove
a
thing
to
be
what
it
isn
t
you
can
t
are
you
sure
certain
sure
he
replied
with
emphasis
do
you
know
that
i
shall
have
to
give
evidence
before
the
court
she
announced
resentfully
it
was
an
announcement
that
gave
him
pause
thoughtfully
he
stroked
his
abominable
tuft
of
red
beard
then
he
dismissed
the
matter
with
a
shrug
and
a
smile
well
and
what
of
it
he
cried
they
are
not
likely
to
bully
you
or
you
just
tell
them
what
you
saw
from
the
balcony
indeed
you
can
t
very
well
say
anything
else
or
they
will
see
that
you
are
lying
and
then
heaven
alone
knows
what
may
happen
to
you
as
well
as
to
she
got
up
in
a
pet
you
re
callous
dick
callous
she
told
him
oh
i
wish
you
had
never
come
to
me
for
he
looked
at
her
and
sneered
that
s
a
matter
you
can
soon
mend
he
told
her
call
up
terence
and
the
others
and
have
me
shot
i
promise
i
shall
make
no
resistance
you
see
i
m
not
able
to
resist
even
if
i
oh
how
can
you
think
it
she
was
indignant
well
what
is
a
poor
devil
to
think
you
blow
hot
and
cold
all
in
a
breath
i
m
sick
and
ill
and
feverish
he
continued
with
and
now
even
you
find
me
a
trouble
i
wish
to
god
they
d
shoot
me
and
make
an
end
i
m
sure
it
would
be
best
for
and
now
she
was
on
her
knees
beside
him
soothing
him
protesting
that
he
had
misunderstood
her
that
she
had
meant
oh
she
didn
t
know
what
she
had
meant
she
was
so
distressed
on
his
account
and
there
s
never
the
need
to
be
he
assured
her
surely
you
can
be
guided
by
me
if
you
want
to
help
me
as
soon
as
ever
my
leg
gets
well
again
i
ll
be
after
fending
for
myself
and
trouble
you
no
further
but
if
you
want
to
shelter
me
until
then
do
it
thoroughly
and
don
t
give
way
to
fear
at
every
shadow
without
substance
that
falls
across
your
she
promised
it
and
on
that
promise
left
him
and
believing
him
she
bore
herself
more
cheerfully
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
but
that
evening
after
they
had
dined
her
fears
and
anxieties
drove
her
at
last
to
seek
her
natural
and
legal
protector
sir
terence
had
sauntered
off
towards
the
house
gloomy
and
silent
as
he
had
been
throughout
the
meal
she
ran
after
him
now
and
came
tripping
lightly
at
his
side
up
the
steps
she
put
her
arm
through
his
terence
dear
you
are
not
going
back
to
work
again
she
pleaded
he
stopped
and
from
his
fine
height
looked
down
upon
her
with
a
curious
smile
slowly
he
disengaged
his
arm
from
the
clasp
of
her
own
i
am
afraid
i
must
he
answered
coldly
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
and
i
am
short
of
a
secretary
when
this
inquiry
is
over
i
shall
have
more
time
to
myself
there
was
something
so
repellent
in
his
voice
in
his
manner
of
uttering
those
last
words
that
she
stood
rebuffed
and
watched
him
vanish
into
the
building
then
she
stamped
her
foot
and
her
pretty
mouth
trembled
oaf
she
said
aloud
chapter
xvi
the
evidence
the
board
of
officers
convened
by
marshal
beresford
to
form
the
court
that
was
to
try
captain
tremayne
was
presided
over
by
general
sir
harry
stapleton
who
was
in
command
of
the
british
troops
quartered
in
lisbon
it
included
amongst
others
the
sir
terence
o
moy
colonel
fletcher
of
the
engineers
who
had
come
in
haste
from
torres
vedras
having
first
desired
to
be
included
in
the
board
chiefly
on
account
of
his
friendship
for
tremayne
and
major
carruthers
the
s
task
of
conducting
the
case
against
the
prisoner
was
deputed
to
the
quartermaster
of
tremayne
s
own
regiment
major
swan
the
court
sat
in
a
long
cheerless
hall
once
the
refectory
of
the
franciscans
who
had
been
the
first
tenants
of
monsanto
it
was
the
windows
set
at
a
height
of
some
ten
feet
from
the
ground
the
bare
whitewashed
walls
hung
with
very
wooden
portraits
of
kings
and
princes
of
portugal
who
had
been
benefactors
of
the
order
the
court
occupied
the
abbot
s
table
which
was
set
on
a
shallow
dais
at
the
end
of
the
room
a
table
of
stone
with
a
covering
of
oak
over
which
a
green
cloth
had
been
spread
the
officers
twelve
in
number
besides
the
president
sat
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
immediately
under
the
inevitable
picture
of
the
last
supper
the
court
being
sworn
captain
tremayne
was
brought
in
by
the
s
guard
and
given
a
stool
placed
immediately
before
and
a
few
paces
from
the
table
perfectly
calm
and
imperturbable
he
saluted
the
court
and
sat
down
his
guards
remaining
some
paces
behind
him
he
had
declined
all
offers
of
a
friend
to
represent
him
on
the
grounds
that
the
court
could
not
possibly
afford
him
a
case
to
answer
the
president
a
florid
rather
pompous
man
who
spoke
with
a
faint
lisp
cleared
his
throat
and
read
the
charge
against
the
prisoner
from
the
sheet
with
which
he
had
been
supplied
the
charge
of
having
violated
the
recent
enactment
against
duelling
made
by
the
of
his
majesty
s
forces
in
the
peninsula
in
so
far
as
he
had
fought
a
duel
with
count
jeronymo
de
samoval
and
of
murder
in
so
far
as
that
duel
conducted
in
an
irregular
manner
and
without
any
witnesses
had
resulted
in
the
death
of
the
said
count
jeronymo
de
samoval
how
say
you
then
captain
tremayne
the
challenged
him
are
you
guilty
of
these
charges
or
not
guilty
not
the
president
sat
back
and
observed
the
prisoner
with
an
eye
that
was
officially
benign
tremayne
s
glance
considered
the
court
and
met
the
concerned
and
grave
regard
of
his
colonel
of
his
friend
carruthers
and
of
two
other
friends
of
his
own
regiment
the
cold
indifference
of
three
officers
of
the
fourteenth
then
stationed
in
lisbon
with
whom
he
was
unacquainted
and
the
utter
inscrutability
of
o
moy
s
rather
lowering
glance
which
profoundly
intrigued
him
and
lastly
the
official
hostility
of
major
swan
who
was
on
his
feet
setting
forth
the
case
against
him
of
the
remaining
members
of
the
court
he
took
no
heed
from
the
opening
address
it
did
not
seem
to
captain
tremayne
as
if
this
case
which
had
been
hurriedly
prepared
by
major
swan
chiefly
that
same
morning
would
amount
to
very
much
briefly
the
major
announced
his
intention
of
establishing
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
how
on
the
night
of
the
of
may
the
prisoner
in
flagrant
violation
of
an
enactment
in
a
general
order
of
the
of
that
same
month
had
engaged
in
a
duel
with
count
jeronymo
de
samoval
a
peer
of
the
realm
of
portugal
followed
a
short
statement
of
the
case
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
prosecution
an
anticipation
of
the
evidence
to
be
called
upon
which
the
major
thought
rather
sanguinely
opined
captain
tremayne
to
convict
the
accused
he
concluded
with
an
assurance
that
the
evidence
of
the
prisoner
s
guilt
was
as
nearly
direct
as
evidence
could
be
in
a
case
of
murder
the
first
witness
called
was
the
butler
mullins
he
was
introduced
by
the
stationed
by
the
double
doors
at
the
end
of
the
hall
from
the
where
the
witnesses
commanded
to
be
present
were
in
waiting
mullins
rather
less
venerable
than
usual
as
a
consequence
of
agitation
and
affliction
on
behalf
of
captain
tremayne
to
whom
he
was
attached
stated
nervously
the
facts
within
his
knowledge
he
was
occupied
with
the
silver
in
his
pantry
having
remained
up
in
case
sir
terence
who
was
working
late
in
his
study
should
require
anything
before
going
to
bed
sir
terence
called
him
and
at
what
time
did
sir
terence
call
you
asked
the
major
it
was
ten
minutes
past
twelve
sir
by
the
clock
in
my
you
are
sure
that
the
clock
was
right
quite
sure
sir
i
had
put
it
right
that
same
very
well
then
sir
terence
called
you
at
ten
minutes
past
twelve
pray
he
gave
me
a
letter
addressed
to
the
take
that
says
he
to
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
at
once
and
tell
him
to
be
sure
that
it
is
forwarded
to
the
first
thing
in
the
i
went
out
at
once
and
on
the
lawn
in
the
quadrangle
i
saw
a
man
lying
on
his
back
on
the
grass
and
another
man
kneeling
beside
him
i
ran
across
to
them
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
bright
as
day
it
was
and
you
could
see
quite
clear
the
gentleman
that
was
kneeling
looks
up
at
me
and
i
sees
it
was
captain
tremayne
sir
what
s
this
captain
dear
says
i
it
s
count
samoval
and
he
s
kilt
says
he
for
god
s
sake
go
and
fetch
so
i
ran
back
to
tell
sir
terence
and
sir
terence
he
came
out
with
me
and
mighty
startled
he
was
at
what
he
found
there
what
s
happened
says
he
and
the
captain
answers
him
just
as
he
had
answered
me
it
s
count
samoval
and
he
s
kilt
but
how
did
it
happen
says
sir
terence
sure
and
that
s
just
what
i
want
to
know
says
the
captain
i
found
him
and
then
sir
terence
turns
to
me
and
mullins
says
he
just
fetch
the
guard
and
of
course
i
went
at
was
there
any
one
else
present
asked
the
prosecutor
not
in
the
quadrangle
sir
but
lady
o
moy
was
on
the
balcony
of
her
room
all
the
well
then
you
fetched
the
guard
what
happened
when
you
returned
colonel
grant
arrived
sir
and
i
understood
him
to
say
that
he
had
been
following
count
samoval
which
way
did
colonel
grant
come
put
in
the
president
by
the
gate
from
the
was
it
open
no
sir
sir
terence
himself
went
to
open
the
wicket
when
colonel
grant
sir
harry
nodded
and
major
swan
resumed
the
examination
what
happened
next
sir
terence
ordered
the
captain
under
did
captain
tremayne
submit
at
once
well
not
quite
at
once
sir
he
naturally
made
some
bother
good
god
he
says
ye
ll
never
be
after
thinking
i
kilt
him
i
tell
you
i
just
found
him
here
like
what
were
ye
doing
here
then
says
sir
terence
i
was
coming
to
see
you
says
the
captain
what
about
says
sir
terence
and
with
that
the
captain
got
angry
said
he
refused
to
be
and
went
off
to
report
himself
under
arrest
as
he
was
that
closed
the
butler
s
evidence
and
the
looked
across
at
the
prisoner
have
you
any
questions
for
the
witness
he
inquired
none
replied
captain
tremayne
he
has
given
his
evidence
very
faithfully
and
major
swan
invited
the
court
to
question
the
witness
in
any
manner
it
considered
desirable
the
only
one
to
avail
himself
of
the
invitation
was
carruthers
who
out
of
his
friendship
and
concern
for
tremayne
and
a
conviction
of
tremayne
s
innocence
begotten
chiefly
by
that
friendship
desired
to
bring
out
anything
that
might
tell
in
his
favour
what
was
captain
tremayne
s
bearing
when
he
spoke
to
you
and
to
sir
terence
quite
as
usual
he
was
quite
calm
not
at
all
perturbed
devil
a
bit
not
until
sir
terence
ordered
him
under
arrest
and
then
he
was
a
little
thank
you
dismissed
by
the
court
mullins
would
have
departed
but
that
upon
being
told
by
the
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
remain
if
he
chose
he
found
a
seat
on
one
of
the
benches
ranged
against
the
wall
the
next
witness
was
sir
terence
who
gave
his
evidence
quietly
from
his
place
at
the
board
immediately
on
the
president
s
right
he
was
pale
but
otherwise
composed
and
the
first
part
of
his
evidence
was
no
more
than
a
confirmation
of
what
mullins
had
said
an
exact
and
strictly
truthful
statement
of
the
circumstances
as
he
had
witnessed
them
from
the
moment
when
mullins
had
summoned
him
you
were
present
i
believe
sir
terence
said
major
swan
at
an
altercation
that
arose
on
the
previous
day
between
captain
tremayne
and
the
deceased
yes
it
happened
at
lunch
here
at
what
was
the
nature
of
it
count
samoval
permitted
himself
to
criticise
adversely
lord
wellington
s
enactment
against
duelling
and
captain
tremayne
defended
it
they
became
a
little
heated
and
the
fact
was
mentioned
that
samoval
himself
was
a
famous
swordsman
captain
tremayne
made
the
remark
that
famous
swordsmen
were
required
by
count
samoval
s
country
to
save
it
from
invasion
the
remark
was
offensive
to
the
deceased
and
although
the
subject
was
abandoned
out
of
regard
for
the
ladies
present
it
was
abandoned
on
a
threat
from
count
samoval
to
continue
it
was
it
so
continued
of
that
i
have
no
invited
to
the
witness
captain
tremayne
again
declined
admitting
freely
that
all
that
sir
terence
had
said
was
strictly
true
then
carruthers
who
appeared
to
be
intent
to
act
as
the
prisoner
s
friend
took
up
the
examination
of
his
chief
it
is
of
course
admitted
that
captain
tremayne
enjoyed
free
access
to
monsanto
practically
at
all
hours
in
his
capacity
as
your
military
secretary
sir
terence
admitted
said
sir
terence
and
it
is
therefore
possible
that
he
might
have
come
upon
the
body
of
the
deceased
just
as
mullins
came
upon
it
it
is
possible
certainly
the
evidence
to
come
will
no
doubt
determine
whether
it
is
a
tenable
admitting
this
then
the
attitude
in
which
captain
tremayne
was
discovered
would
be
a
perfectly
natural
one
it
would
be
natural
that
he
should
investigate
the
identity
and
hurt
of
the
man
he
found
there
but
it
would
hardly
be
natural
that
he
should
linger
by
the
body
of
a
man
he
had
himself
slain
thereby
incurring
the
risk
of
being
discovered
that
is
a
question
for
the
court
rather
than
for
thank
you
sir
and
as
no
one
else
desired
to
question
him
sir
terence
resumed
his
seat
and
lady
o
moy
was
called
she
came
in
very
white
and
trembling
accompanied
by
miss
armytage
whose
admittance
was
suffered
by
the
court
since
she
would
not
be
called
upon
to
give
evidence
one
of
the
officers
of
the
fourteenth
seated
on
the
extreme
right
of
the
table
made
gallant
haste
to
set
a
chair
for
her
ladyship
which
she
accepted
gratefully
the
oath
administered
she
was
invited
gently
by
major
swan
to
tell
the
court
what
she
knew
of
the
case
before
them
but
but
i
know
nothing
she
faltered
in
evident
distress
and
sir
terence
his
elbow
leaning
on
the
table
covered
his
mouth
with
his
hand
that
its
movements
might
not
betray
him
his
eyes
glowered
upon
her
with
a
ferocity
that
was
hardly
dissembled
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
tell
the
court
what
you
saw
from
your
balcony
the
major
insisted
the
court
will
be
perceiving
her
agitation
and
attributing
it
to
nervousness
moved
also
by
that
delicate
loveliness
of
hers
and
by
deference
to
the
lady
sir
harry
stapleton
intervened
is
lady
o
moy
s
evidence
really
necessary
he
asked
does
it
contribute
any
fresh
fact
regarding
the
discovery
of
the
body
no
sir
major
swan
admitted
it
is
merely
a
corroboration
of
what
we
have
already
heard
from
mullins
and
sir
then
why
unnecessarily
distress
this
lady
oh
for
my
own
part
sir
the
prosecutor
was
submitting
when
sir
terence
cut
in
i
think
that
in
the
prisoner
s
interest
perhaps
lady
o
moy
will
not
mind
being
distressed
a
it
was
at
her
he
looked
and
for
her
and
tremayne
alone
that
he
intended
the
cutting
lash
of
sarcasm
concealed
from
the
rest
of
the
court
by
his
smooth
accent
mullins
has
said
i
think
that
her
ladyship
was
on
the
balcony
when
he
came
into
the
quadrangle
her
evidence
therefore
takes
us
further
back
in
point
of
time
than
does
mullins
again
the
sarcastic
double
meaning
was
only
for
those
two
considering
that
the
prisoner
is
being
tried
for
his
life
i
do
not
think
we
should
miss
anything
that
may
however
slightly
affect
our
sir
terence
is
right
i
think
sir
the
supported
very
well
then
said
the
president
proceed
if
you
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
the
court
lady
o
moy
how
you
came
to
be
upon
the
balcony
her
pallor
had
deepened
and
her
eyes
looked
more
than
ordinarily
large
and
as
they
turned
this
way
and
that
to
survey
the
members
of
the
court
nervously
she
dabbed
her
lips
with
a
handkerchief
before
answering
mechanically
as
she
had
been
schooled
i
heard
a
cry
and
i
ran
out
you
were
in
bed
at
the
time
of
course
quoth
her
husband
interrupting
what
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
it
sir
terence
the
president
rebuked
him
out
of
his
earnest
desire
to
cut
this
examination
as
short
as
possible
the
question
sir
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
without
point
replied
o
moy
he
was
judicially
smooth
and
it
is
intended
to
enable
us
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
the
lapse
of
time
between
her
ladyship
s
hearing
the
cry
and
reaching
the
grudgingly
the
president
admitted
the
point
and
the
question
was
repeated
came
lady
o
moy
s
tremulous
faltering
answer
i
was
in
but
not
asleep
or
were
you
asleep
rapped
o
moy
again
and
in
answer
to
the
president
s
impatient
glance
again
explained
himself
we
should
know
whether
perhaps
the
cry
might
not
have
been
repeated
several
times
before
her
ladyship
heard
it
that
is
of
it
would
be
more
regular
ventured
the
if
sir
terence
would
reserve
his
examination
of
the
witness
until
she
has
given
her
very
well
grumbled
sir
terence
and
he
sat
back
foiled
for
the
moment
in
his
deliberate
intent
to
torture
her
into
admissions
that
must
betray
her
if
made
i
was
not
asleep
she
told
the
court
thus
answering
her
husband
s
last
question
i
heard
the
cry
and
ran
to
the
balcony
at
once
that
that
is
but
what
did
you
see
from
the
balcony
asked
major
swan
it
was
night
and
of
course
it
it
was
dark
she
answered
surely
not
dark
lady
o
moy
there
was
a
moon
i
think
a
full
moon
yes
but
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
shadow
in
the
garden
and
and
i
couldn
t
see
anything
at
but
you
did
eventually
oh
eventually
yes
her
fingers
were
twisting
and
untwisting
the
handkerchief
they
held
and
her
distressed
loveliness
was
very
piteous
to
see
yet
it
seems
to
have
occurred
to
none
of
them
that
this
distress
and
the
minor
contradictions
into
which
it
led
her
were
the
result
of
her
intent
to
conceal
the
truth
of
her
terror
lest
it
should
nevertheless
be
wrung
from
her
only
o
moy
watching
her
and
reading
in
her
every
word
and
glance
and
gesture
the
signs
of
her
falsehood
knew
the
hideous
thing
she
strove
to
hide
even
it
seemed
at
the
cost
of
her
lover
s
life
to
his
lacerated
soul
her
torture
was
a
balm
gloating
he
watched
her
then
and
watched
her
lover
marvelling
at
the
blackguard
s
complete
and
impassivity
even
now
major
swan
was
urging
her
gently
eventually
then
what
was
it
that
you
saw
i
saw
a
man
lying
on
the
ground
and
another
kneeling
over
him
and
then
almost
at
once
mullins
came
out
and
i
don
t
think
we
need
take
this
any
further
major
swan
the
president
again
interposed
we
have
heard
what
happened
after
mullins
came
unless
the
prisoner
wishes
began
the
by
no
means
said
tremayne
composedly
although
outwardly
impassive
he
had
been
watching
her
intently
and
it
was
his
eyes
that
had
perturbed
her
more
than
anything
in
that
court
it
was
she
who
must
determine
for
him
how
to
proceed
how
far
to
defend
himself
he
had
hoped
that
by
now
dick
butler
might
have
been
got
away
so
that
it
would
have
been
safe
to
tell
the
whole
truth
although
he
began
to
doubt
how
far
that
could
avail
him
how
far
indeed
it
would
be
believed
in
the
absence
of
dick
butler
her
evidence
told
him
that
such
hopes
as
he
may
have
entertained
had
been
idle
and
that
he
must
depend
for
his
life
simply
upon
the
court
s
inability
to
bring
the
guilt
home
to
him
in
this
he
had
some
confidence
for
knowing
himself
innocent
it
seemed
to
him
incredible
that
he
could
be
proven
guilty
failing
that
nothing
short
of
the
discovery
of
the
real
slayer
of
samoval
could
save
him
and
that
was
a
matter
wrapped
in
the
profoundest
mystery
the
only
man
who
could
conceivably
have
fought
samoval
in
such
a
place
was
sir
terence
himself
but
then
it
was
utterly
inconceivable
that
in
that
case
sir
terence
who
was
the
very
soul
of
honour
should
not
only
keep
silent
and
allow
another
man
to
suffer
but
actually
sit
there
in
judgment
upon
that
other
and
besides
there
was
no
quarrel
nor
ever
had
been
between
sir
terence
and
samoval
there
is
major
swan
was
saying
just
one
other
matter
upon
which
i
should
like
to
question
lady
o
and
thereupon
he
proceeded
to
do
so
your
ladyship
will
remember
that
on
the
day
before
the
event
in
which
count
samoval
met
his
death
he
was
one
of
a
small
luncheon
party
at
your
house
here
in
yes
she
replied
wondering
fearfully
what
might
be
coming
now
would
your
ladyship
be
good
enough
to
tell
the
court
who
were
the
other
members
of
that
party
it
it
was
hardly
a
party
sir
she
answered
with
her
unconquerable
insistence
upon
trifles
we
were
just
sir
terence
and
myself
miss
armytage
count
samoval
colonel
grant
major
carruthers
and
captain
can
your
ladyship
recall
any
words
that
passed
between
the
deceased
and
captain
tremayne
on
that
occasion
words
of
disagreement
i
mean
she
knew
that
there
had
been
something
but
in
her
benumbed
state
of
mind
she
was
incapable
of
remembering
what
it
was
all
that
remained
in
her
memory
was
sylvia
s
warning
after
she
and
her
cousin
had
left
the
table
sylvia
s
insistence
that
she
should
call
captain
tremayne
away
to
avoid
trouble
between
himself
and
the
count
but
search
as
she
would
the
actual
subject
of
disagreement
eluded
her
moreover
it
occurred
to
her
suddenly
and
sowed
fresh
terror
in
her
soul
that
whatever
it
was
it
would
tell
against
captain
tremayne
i
i
am
afraid
i
don
t
remember
she
faltered
at
last
try
to
think
lady
o
i
i
have
tried
but
i
i
can
her
voice
had
fallen
almost
to
a
whisper
need
we
insist
put
in
the
president
compassionately
there
are
sufficient
witnesses
as
to
what
passed
on
that
occasion
without
further
harassing
her
quite
so
sir
the
major
agreed
in
his
dry
voice
it
only
remains
for
the
prisoner
to
question
the
witness
if
he
so
tremayne
shook
his
head
it
is
quite
unnecessary
sir
he
assured
the
president
and
never
saw
the
swift
grim
smile
that
flashed
across
sir
terence
s
stern
face
of
the
court
sir
terence
was
the
only
member
who
could
have
desired
to
prolong
the
painful
examination
of
her
ladyship
but
he
perceived
from
the
president
s
attitude
that
he
could
not
do
so
without
betraying
the
vindictiveness
actuating
him
and
so
he
remained
silent
for
the
present
he
would
have
gone
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
her
ladyship
should
be
invited
to
remain
in
court
against
the
possibility
of
further
evidence
being
presently
required
from
her
but
that
he
perceived
there
was
no
necessity
to
do
so
her
deadly
anxiety
concerning
the
prisoner
must
in
itself
be
sufficient
to
determine
her
to
remain
as
indeed
it
proved
accompanied
and
half
supported
by
miss
armytage
who
was
almost
as
pale
as
herself
but
otherwise
very
steady
in
her
bearing
lady
o
moy
made
her
way
with
faltering
steps
to
the
benches
ranged
against
the
side
wall
and
sat
there
to
hear
the
remainder
of
the
proceedings
after
the
uninteresting
and
perfunctory
evidence
of
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
who
had
been
present
when
the
prisoner
was
ordered
under
arrest
the
next
witness
called
was
colonel
grant
his
testimony
was
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
facts
which
we
know
him
to
have
witnessed
but
when
he
was
in
the
middle
of
his
statement
an
interruption
occurred
at
the
extreme
right
of
the
dais
on
which
the
table
stood
there
was
a
small
oaken
door
set
in
the
wall
and
giving
access
to
a
small
that
was
known
rightly
or
wrongly
as
the
abbot
s
chamber
that
anteroom
communicated
directly
with
what
was
now
the
guardroom
which
accounts
for
the
being
ushered
in
that
way
by
the
corporal
at
the
time
at
the
opening
of
that
door
the
members
of
the
court
looked
round
in
sharp
annoyance
suspecting
here
some
impertinent
intrusion
the
next
moment
however
this
was
changed
to
respectful
surprise
there
was
a
scraping
of
chairs
and
they
were
all
on
their
feet
in
token
of
respect
for
the
slight
man
in
the
grey
undress
frock
who
entered
it
was
lord
wellington
saluting
the
members
of
the
court
with
two
fingers
to
his
cocked
hat
he
immediately
desired
them
to
sit
peremptorily
waving
his
hand
and
requesting
the
president
not
to
allow
his
entrance
to
interrupt
or
interfere
with
the
course
of
the
inquiry
a
chair
here
for
me
if
you
please
sergeant
he
called
and
when
it
was
fetched
took
his
seat
at
the
end
of
the
table
with
his
back
to
the
door
through
which
he
had
come
and
immediately
facing
the
prosecutor
he
retained
his
hat
but
placed
his
on
the
table
before
him
and
the
only
thing
he
would
accept
was
an
officer
s
notes
of
the
proceedings
as
far
as
they
had
gone
which
that
officer
himself
was
prompt
to
offer
with
a
repeated
injunction
to
the
court
to
proceed
lord
wellington
became
instantly
absorbed
in
the
study
of
these
notes
colonel
grant
standing
very
straight
and
stiff
in
the
originally
red
coat
which
exposure
to
many
weathers
had
faded
to
an
autumnal
brown
continued
and
concluded
his
statement
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
on
the
night
of
the
of
may
in
the
garden
at
monsanto
the
now
invited
him
to
turn
his
memory
back
to
the
at
sir
terence
s
on
the
and
to
tell
the
court
of
the
altercation
that
had
passed
on
that
occasion
between
captain
tremayne
and
count
samoval
the
conversation
at
table
he
replied
turned
as
was
perhaps
quite
natural
upon
the
recently
published
general
order
prohibiting
duelling
and
making
it
a
capital
offence
for
officers
in
his
majesty
s
service
in
the
peninsula
count
samoval
stigmatised
the
order
as
a
degrading
and
arbitrary
one
and
spoke
in
defence
of
single
combat
as
the
only
honourable
method
of
settling
differences
between
gentlemen
captain
tremayne
dissented
rather
sharply
and
appeared
to
resent
the
term
degrading
applied
by
the
count
to
the
enactment
words
followed
and
then
some
one
lady
o
moy
i
think
and
as
i
imagine
with
intent
to
soothe
the
feelings
of
count
samoval
which
appeared
to
be
ruffled
appealed
to
his
vanity
by
mentioning
the
fact
that
he
was
himself
a
famous
swordsman
to
this
captain
tremayne
s
observation
was
a
rather
unfortunate
one
although
i
must
confess
that
i
was
fully
in
sympathy
with
it
at
the
time
he
said
as
nearly
as
i
remember
that
at
the
moment
portugal
was
in
urgent
need
of
famous
swords
to
defend
her
from
invasion
and
not
to
increase
the
disorders
at
lord
wellington
looked
up
from
the
notes
and
thoughtfully
stroked
his
nose
his
stern
handsome
face
was
coldly
impassive
his
fine
eyes
resting
upon
the
prisoner
but
his
attention
all
to
what
colonel
grant
was
saying
it
was
a
remark
of
which
samoval
betrayed
the
bitterest
resentment
he
demanded
of
captain
tremayne
that
he
should
be
more
precise
and
tremayne
replied
that
whilst
he
had
spoken
generally
samoval
was
welcome
to
the
cap
if
he
found
it
fitted
him
to
that
he
added
a
suggestion
that
as
the
conversation
appeared
to
be
tiresome
to
the
ladies
it
would
be
better
to
change
its
topic
count
samoval
consented
but
with
the
promise
rather
threateningly
delivered
that
it
should
be
continued
at
another
time
that
sir
is
all
i
have
you
any
questions
for
the
witness
captain
tremayne
inquired
the
as
before
captain
tremayne
s
answer
was
in
the
negative
coupled
with
the
now
usual
admission
that
colonel
grant
s
statement
accorded
perfectly
with
his
own
recollection
of
the
facts
the
court
however
desired
enlightenment
on
several
subjects
came
first
of
all
carruthers
s
inquiries
as
to
the
bearing
of
the
prisoner
when
ordered
under
arrest
eliciting
from
colonel
grant
a
variant
of
the
usual
reply
it
was
not
inconsistent
with
innocence
he
said
it
was
an
answer
which
appeared
to
startle
the
court
and
perhaps
carruthers
would
have
acted
best
in
tremayne
s
interest
had
he
left
the
question
there
but
having
obtained
so
much
he
eagerly
sought
for
more
would
you
say
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
guilt
he
cried
colonel
grant
smiled
slowly
and
slowly
shook
his
head
i
fear
i
could
not
go
so
far
as
that
he
answered
thereby
plunging
poor
carruthers
into
despair
and
now
colonel
fletcher
voiced
a
question
agitating
the
minds
of
several
members
of
the
count
colonel
grant
he
said
you
have
told
us
that
on
the
night
in
question
you
had
count
samoval
under
observation
and
that
upon
word
being
brought
to
you
of
his
movements
by
one
of
your
agents
you
yourself
followed
him
to
monsanto
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
the
court
why
you
were
watching
the
deceased
s
movements
at
the
time
colonel
grant
glanced
at
lord
wellington
he
smiled
a
little
reflectively
and
shook
his
head
i
am
afraid
that
the
public
interest
will
not
allow
me
to
answer
your
question
since
however
lord
wellington
himself
is
present
i
would
suggest
that
you
ask
his
lordship
whether
i
am
to
give
you
the
information
you
certainly
not
said
his
lordship
crisply
without
awaiting
further
question
indeed
one
of
my
reasons
for
being
present
is
to
ensure
that
nothing
on
that
score
shall
there
followed
a
moment
s
silence
then
the
president
ventured
a
question
may
we
ask
sir
at
least
whether
colonel
grant
s
observation
of
count
samoval
resulted
from
any
knowledge
of
or
expectation
of
this
duel
that
was
impending
certainly
you
may
ask
that
lord
wellington
consented
it
did
not
sir
said
colonel
grant
in
answer
to
the
question
what
grounds
had
you
colonel
grant
for
assuming
that
count
samoval
was
going
to
monsanto
the
president
asked
chiefly
the
direction
and
nothing
else
i
think
we
are
upon
forbidden
ground
again
said
colonel
grant
and
again
he
looked
at
lord
wellington
for
direction
i
do
not
see
the
point
of
the
question
said
lord
wellington
replying
to
that
glance
colonel
grant
has
quite
plainly
informed
the
court
that
his
observation
of
count
samoval
had
no
slightest
connection
with
this
duel
nor
was
inspired
by
any
knowledge
or
suspicion
on
his
part
that
any
such
duel
was
to
be
fought
with
that
i
think
the
court
should
be
content
it
has
been
necessary
for
colonel
grant
to
explain
to
the
court
his
own
presence
at
monsanto
at
midnight
on
the
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
had
he
simply
stated
that
it
was
fortuitous
although
i
can
understand
that
the
court
might
have
hesitated
to
accept
such
a
statement
that
however
is
really
all
that
concerns
the
matter
colonel
grant
happened
to
be
there
that
is
all
that
the
court
need
remember
let
me
add
the
assurance
that
it
would
not
in
the
least
assist
the
court
to
know
more
so
far
as
the
case
under
consideration
is
in
view
of
that
the
president
notified
that
he
had
nothing
further
to
ask
the
witness
and
colonel
grant
saluted
and
withdrew
to
a
seat
near
lady
o
moy
there
followed
the
evidence
of
major
carruthers
with
regard
to
the
dispute
between
count
samoval
and
captain
tremayne
which
substantially
bore
out
what
sir
terence
and
colonel
grant
had
already
said
notwithstanding
that
it
manifested
a
strong
bias
in
favour
of
the
prisoner
the
conversation
which
samoval
threatened
to
resume
does
not
appear
to
have
been
resumed
he
added
in
conclusion
how
can
you
say
that
major
swan
asked
him
i
may
state
my
opinion
sir
flashed
carruthers
his
chubby
face
reddening
indeed
sir
you
may
not
the
president
assured
him
you
are
upon
oath
to
give
evidence
of
facts
directly
within
your
own
personal
it
is
directly
within
my
own
personal
knowledge
that
captain
tremayne
was
called
away
from
the
table
by
lady
o
moy
and
that
he
did
not
have
another
opportunity
of
speaking
with
count
samoval
that
day
i
saw
the
count
leave
shortly
after
and
at
the
time
captain
tremayne
was
still
with
her
ladyship
as
her
ladyship
can
testify
if
necessary
he
spent
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
with
me
at
work
and
we
went
home
together
in
the
evening
we
share
the
same
lodging
in
there
was
still
all
of
the
next
day
said
sir
harry
do
you
say
that
the
prisoner
was
never
out
of
your
sight
on
that
day
too
i
do
not
but
i
can
t
believe
i
am
afraid
you
are
going
to
state
opinions
again
major
swan
interposed
yet
it
is
evidence
of
a
kind
insisted
carruthers
with
the
tenacity
of
a
he
looked
as
if
he
would
make
it
a
personal
matter
between
himself
and
major
swan
if
he
were
not
allowed
to
proceed
i
can
t
believe
that
captain
tremayne
would
have
embroiled
himself
further
with
count
samoval
captain
tremayne
has
too
high
a
regard
for
discipline
and
for
orders
and
he
is
the
least
excitable
man
i
have
ever
known
nor
do
i
believe
that
he
would
have
consented
to
meet
samoval
without
my
not
perhaps
unless
captain
tremayne
desired
to
keep
the
matter
secret
in
view
of
the
general
order
which
is
precisely
what
it
is
contended
that
he
falsely
contended
then
snapped
major
carruthers
to
be
instantly
rebuked
by
the
president
he
sat
down
in
a
huff
and
the
called
private
bates
who
had
been
on
sentry
duty
on
the
night
of
the
to
corroborate
the
evidence
of
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
as
to
the
hour
at
which
the
prisoner
had
driven
up
to
monsanto
in
his
curricle
private
bates
having
been
heard
major
swan
announced
that
he
did
not
propose
to
call
any
further
witnesses
and
resumed
his
seat
thereupon
to
the
president
s
invitation
captain
tremayne
replied
that
he
had
no
witnesses
to
call
at
all
in
that
case
major
swan
said
sir
harry
the
court
will
be
glad
to
hear
you
and
major
swan
came
to
his
feet
again
to
address
the
court
for
the
prosecution
chapter
xvii
bitter
water
major
swan
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
gifted
soldier
history
is
silent
on
the
point
but
the
surviving
records
of
the
with
which
we
are
concerned
go
to
show
that
he
was
certainly
not
a
gifted
speaker
his
vocabulary
was
limited
his
rhetoric
clumsy
and
major
carruthers
denounces
his
delivery
as
halting
his
very
voice
dull
and
monotonous
also
his
manner
reflecting
his
mind
on
this
occasion
appears
to
have
been
perfectly
unimpassioned
he
had
been
saddled
with
a
duty
and
he
must
perform
it
he
would
do
so
conscientiously
to
the
best
of
his
ability
for
he
seems
to
have
been
a
conscientious
man
but
he
could
not
be
expected
to
put
his
heart
into
the
matter
since
he
was
not
inflamed
by
any
zeal
born
of
conviction
nor
had
he
any
of
the
incentives
of
a
civil
advocate
to
sway
his
audience
by
all
possible
means
nevertheless
the
facts
themselves
properly
marshalled
made
up
a
dangerous
case
against
the
prisoner
major
swan
began
by
dwelling
upon
the
evidence
of
motive
there
had
been
a
quarrel
or
the
beginnings
of
a
quarrel
between
the
deceased
and
the
accused
the
deceased
had
shown
himself
affronted
and
had
been
heard
quite
unequivocally
to
say
that
the
matter
could
not
be
left
at
the
stage
at
which
it
was
interrupted
at
sir
terence
s
major
swan
dwelt
for
a
moment
upon
the
grounds
of
the
quarrel
they
were
by
no
means
discreditable
to
the
accused
but
it
was
singularly
unfortunate
ironical
almost
that
he
should
have
involved
himself
in
a
duel
as
a
result
of
his
defence
of
a
wise
measure
which
made
duelling
in
the
british
army
a
capital
offence
with
that
however
he
did
not
think
that
the
court
was
immediately
concerned
by
the
duel
itself
the
accused
had
offended
against
the
recent
enactment
and
moreover
the
irregular
manner
in
which
the
encounter
had
been
conducted
without
seconds
or
witnesses
rendered
the
accused
answerable
to
a
charge
of
murder
if
it
could
be
proved
that
he
actually
did
engage
and
kill
the
deceased
major
swan
thought
this
could
be
proved
the
irregularity
of
the
meeting
must
be
assigned
to
the
enactment
against
which
it
offended
a
matter
which
under
other
circumstances
considering
the
good
character
borne
by
captain
tremayne
would
have
been
quite
incomprehensible
was
he
thought
under
existing
circumstances
perfectly
clear
because
captain
tremayne
could
not
have
found
any
friend
to
act
for
him
he
was
forced
to
forgo
witnesses
to
the
encounter
and
because
of
the
consequences
to
himself
of
the
encounter
s
becoming
known
he
was
forced
to
contrive
that
it
should
be
held
in
secret
they
knew
from
the
evidence
of
colonel
grant
and
major
carruthers
that
the
meeting
was
desired
by
count
samoval
and
they
were
therefore
entitled
to
assume
that
recognising
the
conditions
arising
out
of
the
recent
enactment
the
deceased
had
consented
that
the
meeting
should
take
place
in
this
irregular
fashion
since
otherwise
it
could
not
have
been
held
at
all
and
he
would
have
been
compelled
to
forgo
the
satisfaction
he
desired
he
passed
to
the
consideration
of
the
locality
chosen
and
there
he
confessed
that
he
was
confronted
with
a
mystery
yet
the
mystery
would
have
been
no
less
in
the
case
of
any
other
opponent
than
captain
tremayne
since
it
was
clear
beyond
all
doubt
that
a
duel
had
been
fought
and
count
samoval
killed
and
no
less
clear
that
it
was
a
premeditated
combat
and
that
the
deceased
had
gone
to
monsanto
expressly
to
engage
in
it
since
the
duelling
swords
found
had
been
identified
as
his
property
and
must
have
been
carried
by
him
to
the
encounter
the
mystery
he
repeated
would
have
been
no
less
in
the
case
of
any
other
opponent
than
captain
tremayne
indeed
in
the
case
of
some
other
opponent
it
might
even
have
been
deeper
it
must
be
remembered
after
all
that
the
place
was
one
to
which
the
accused
had
free
access
at
all
hours
and
it
was
clearly
proven
that
he
availed
himself
of
that
access
on
the
night
in
question
evidence
had
been
placed
before
the
court
showing
that
he
had
come
to
monsanto
in
a
curricle
at
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
at
the
latest
and
there
was
abundant
evidence
to
show
that
he
was
found
kneeling
beside
the
body
of
the
dead
man
at
ten
minutes
past
twelve
the
body
being
quite
warm
at
the
time
and
the
breath
hardly
out
of
it
proving
that
he
had
fallen
but
an
instant
before
the
arrival
of
mullins
and
the
other
witnesses
who
had
testified
unless
captain
tremayne
could
account
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
for
the
manner
in
which
he
had
spent
that
major
swan
did
not
perceive
when
all
the
facts
of
motive
and
circumstance
were
considered
what
conclusion
the
court
could
reach
other
than
that
captain
tremayne
was
guilty
of
the
death
of
count
jeronymo
de
samoval
in
a
single
combat
fought
under
clandestine
and
irregular
conditions
transforming
the
deed
into
technical
murder
upon
that
conclusion
the
major
sat
down
to
mop
a
brow
that
was
perspiring
freely
from
lady
o
moy
in
the
background
came
faintly
the
sound
of
a
moan
terrified
she
clutched
the
hand
of
miss
armytage
and
found
that
hand
to
lie
like
a
thing
of
ice
in
her
own
yet
she
suspected
nothing
of
the
deep
agitation
under
her
companion
s
outward
appearance
of
calm
captain
tremayne
rose
slowly
to
address
the
court
in
reply
to
the
prosecution
as
he
faced
his
judges
now
he
met
the
smouldering
eyes
of
sir
terence
considering
him
with
such
malevolence
that
he
was
shocked
and
bewildered
was
he
prejudged
already
and
by
his
best
friend
if
so
what
must
be
the
attitude
of
the
others
but
the
kindly
florid
countenance
of
the
president
was
friendly
and
encouraging
there
was
eager
anxiety
for
him
in
the
gaze
of
his
friend
caruthers
he
glanced
at
lord
wellington
sitting
at
the
table
s
end
sternly
inscrutable
a
mere
spectator
yet
one
whose
habit
of
command
gave
him
an
air
that
was
authoritative
and
judicial
at
length
he
began
to
speak
he
had
considered
his
defence
and
he
had
based
it
mainly
upon
a
falsehood
since
the
strict
truth
must
have
proved
ruinous
to
richard
butler
my
answer
gentlemen
he
said
will
be
a
very
brief
one
as
brief
indeed
as
the
prosecution
merits
for
i
entertain
the
hope
that
no
member
of
this
court
is
satisfied
that
the
case
made
out
against
me
is
by
any
means
he
spoke
easily
fluently
and
calmly
a
man
supremely
it
amounts
indeed
to
throwing
upon
me
the
onus
of
proving
myself
innocent
and
that
is
a
burden
which
no
british
laws
civil
or
miliary
would
ever
commit
the
injustice
of
imposing
upon
an
accused
that
certain
words
of
disagreement
passed
between
count
samoval
and
myself
on
the
eve
of
the
affair
in
which
the
count
met
his
death
as
you
have
heard
from
various
witnesses
i
at
once
and
freely
admitted
thereby
i
saved
the
court
time
and
trouble
and
some
other
witnesses
who
might
have
been
caused
the
distress
of
having
to
testify
against
me
but
that
the
dispute
ever
had
any
sequel
that
the
further
subsequent
discussion
threatened
at
the
time
by
count
samoval
ever
took
place
i
most
solemnly
deny
from
the
moment
that
i
left
sir
terence
s
on
the
saturday
i
never
set
eyes
on
count
samoval
again
until
i
discovered
him
dead
or
dying
in
the
garden
here
at
monsanto
on
sunday
night
i
can
call
no
witnesses
to
support
me
in
this
because
it
is
not
a
matter
susceptible
to
proof
by
evidence
nor
have
i
troubled
to
call
the
only
witnesses
i
might
have
called
witnesses
as
to
my
character
and
my
regard
for
discipline
who
might
have
testified
that
any
such
encounter
as
that
of
which
i
am
accused
would
be
utterly
foreign
to
my
nature
there
are
officers
in
plenty
in
his
majesty
s
service
who
could
bear
witness
that
the
practice
of
duelling
is
one
that
i
hold
in
the
utmost
abhorrence
since
i
have
frequently
avowed
it
and
since
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
fought
a
single
duel
my
service
in
his
majesty
s
army
has
happily
afforded
me
the
means
of
dispensing
with
any
such
proof
of
courage
as
the
duel
is
supposed
to
give
i
say
i
might
have
called
witnesses
to
that
fact
and
i
have
not
done
so
this
is
because
fortunately
there
are
several
among
the
members
of
this
court
to
whom
i
have
been
known
for
many
years
and
who
can
themselves
when
this
court
comes
to
consider
its
finding
support
my
present
assertion
let
me
ask
you
then
gentlemen
whether
it
is
conceivable
that
entertaining
such
feelings
as
these
towards
single
combat
i
should
have
been
led
to
depart
from
them
under
circumstances
that
might
very
well
have
afforded
me
an
ample
shield
for
refusing
satisfaction
to
a
too
eager
and
pressing
adversary
it
was
precisely
because
i
hold
the
duel
in
such
contempt
that
i
spoke
with
such
asperity
to
the
deceased
when
he
pronounced
lord
wellington
s
enactment
a
degrading
one
to
men
of
birth
the
very
sentiments
which
i
then
expressed
proclaimed
my
antipathy
to
the
practice
how
then
should
i
have
committed
the
inconsistency
of
accepting
a
challenge
upon
such
grounds
from
count
samoval
there
is
even
more
irony
than
major
swan
supposes
in
a
situation
which
himself
has
called
ironical
so
much
then
for
the
motives
that
are
alleged
to
have
actuated
me
i
hope
you
will
conclude
that
i
have
answered
the
prosecution
upon
that
matter
coming
to
the
question
of
fact
i
can
not
find
that
there
is
anything
to
answer
for
nothing
has
been
proved
against
me
true
it
has
been
proved
that
i
arrived
at
monsanto
at
eleven
or
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
on
the
night
of
the
and
it
has
been
further
proved
that
later
i
was
discovered
kneeling
beside
the
dead
body
of
count
samoval
but
to
say
that
this
proves
that
i
killed
him
is
more
i
think
if
i
understood
him
correctly
than
major
swan
himself
dares
to
assert
major
swan
is
quite
satisfied
that
samoval
came
to
monsanto
for
the
purpose
of
fighting
a
duel
that
had
been
prearranged
and
i
admit
that
the
two
swords
found
which
have
been
proven
the
property
of
count
samoval
and
which
therefore
he
must
have
brought
with
him
are
a
proof
of
such
a
contention
but
if
we
assume
gentlemen
that
i
had
accepted
a
challenge
from
the
count
let
me
ask
you
can
you
think
of
any
place
less
likely
to
have
been
appointed
or
agreed
to
by
me
for
the
encounter
than
the
garden
of
the
s
quarters
secrecy
is
urged
as
the
reason
for
the
irregularity
of
the
meeting
what
secrecy
was
ensured
in
such
a
place
where
interruption
and
discovery
might
come
at
any
moment
although
the
duel
was
held
at
midnight
and
what
secrecy
did
i
observe
in
my
movements
considering
that
i
drove
openly
to
monsanto
in
a
curricle
which
i
left
standing
at
the
gates
in
full
view
of
the
guard
to
await
my
return
should
i
have
acted
thus
if
i
had
been
upon
such
an
errand
as
is
alleged
common
sense
i
think
should
straightway
acquit
me
on
the
grounds
of
the
locality
alone
and
i
can
not
think
that
it
should
even
be
necessary
for
me
so
as
to
complete
my
answer
to
an
accusation
entirely
without
support
in
fact
or
in
logic
to
account
for
my
presence
at
monsanto
and
my
movements
during
the
in
he
paused
so
far
his
clear
reasoning
had
held
and
impressed
the
court
this
he
saw
plainly
written
on
the
faces
of
all
with
one
single
exception
sir
terence
alone
the
one
man
from
whom
he
might
have
looked
for
the
greatest
relief
watched
him
ever
malevolently
sardonically
with
curling
lip
it
gave
him
pause
now
that
he
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
falsehood
and
because
of
that
inexplicable
but
obvious
hostility
that
attitude
of
expectancy
to
ensnare
and
destroy
him
captain
tremayne
hesitated
to
step
from
the
solid
ground
of
reason
upon
which
he
had
confidently
walked
thus
far
on
to
the
uncertain
bogland
of
mendacity
i
can
not
think
he
said
that
the
court
should
consider
it
necessary
for
me
to
advance
an
alibi
to
make
a
statement
in
proof
of
my
innocence
where
i
contend
that
no
proof
has
been
offered
of
my
i
think
it
will
be
better
sir
in
your
own
interests
so
that
you
may
be
the
more
completely
cleared
the
president
replied
and
so
compelled
him
to
continue
there
was
he
resumed
then
a
certain
matter
connected
with
the
s
department
which
was
of
the
greatest
urgency
yet
which
under
stress
of
work
had
been
postponed
until
the
morrow
it
was
concerned
with
some
tents
for
general
picton
s
division
at
celorico
it
occurred
to
me
that
night
that
it
would
be
better
dealt
with
at
once
so
that
the
documents
relating
to
it
could
go
forward
early
on
monday
morning
to
the
accordingly
i
returned
to
monsanto
entered
the
official
quarters
and
was
engaged
upon
that
task
when
a
cry
from
the
garden
reached
my
ears
that
cry
in
the
dead
of
night
was
sufficiently
alarming
and
i
ran
out
at
once
to
see
what
might
have
occasioned
it
i
found
count
samoval
either
just
dead
or
just
dying
and
i
had
scarcely
made
the
discovery
when
mullins
the
butler
came
out
of
the
residential
wing
as
he
has
testified
that
sirs
is
all
that
i
know
of
the
death
of
count
samoval
and
i
will
conclude
with
my
solemn
affirmation
on
my
honour
as
a
soldier
that
i
am
as
innocent
of
having
procured
it
as
i
am
ignorant
of
how
it
came
about
i
leave
myself
with
confidence
in
your
hands
gentlemen
he
ended
and
resumed
his
seat
that
he
had
favourably
impressed
the
court
was
clear
miss
armytage
whispered
it
to
lady
o
moy
exultation
quivering
in
her
whisper
he
is
safe
and
she
added
he
was
lady
o
moy
pressed
her
hand
in
return
thank
god
oh
thank
god
she
murmured
under
her
breath
i
do
said
miss
armytage
there
was
silence
broken
only
by
the
rustle
of
the
president
s
notes
as
he
briefly
looked
them
over
as
a
preliminary
to
addressing
the
court
and
then
suddenly
grating
harshly
upon
that
silence
came
the
voice
of
o
moy
might
i
suggest
sir
harry
that
before
we
hear
you
three
of
the
witnesses
be
recalled
they
are
sergeant
flynn
private
bates
and
the
president
looked
round
in
surprise
and
carruthers
took
advantage
of
the
pause
to
interpose
an
objection
is
such
a
course
regular
sir
harry
he
too
had
become
conscious
at
last
of
sir
terence
s
relentless
hostility
to
the
accused
the
court
has
been
given
an
opportunity
of
examining
those
witnesses
the
accused
has
declined
to
call
any
on
his
own
behalf
and
the
prosecution
has
already
closed
its
sir
harry
considered
a
moment
he
had
never
been
very
clear
upon
matters
of
procedure
which
he
looked
upon
as
none
of
a
soldier
s
real
business
instinctively
in
this
difficulty
he
looked
at
lord
wellington
as
if
for
guidance
but
his
lordship
s
face
told
him
absolutely
nothing
the
remaining
an
impassive
spectator
then
whilst
the
president
coughed
and
pondered
major
swan
came
to
the
rescue
the
court
said
the
is
entitled
at
any
time
before
the
finding
to
call
or
recall
any
witnesses
provided
that
the
prisoner
is
afforded
an
opportunity
of
answering
anything
further
that
may
be
elicited
in
of
these
that
is
the
rule
said
sir
terence
and
rightly
so
for
as
in
the
present
instance
the
prisoner
s
own
statement
may
make
it
the
president
gave
way
thereby
renewing
miss
armytage
s
terrors
and
shaking
at
last
even
the
prisoner
s
calm
sergeant
flynn
was
the
first
of
the
witnesses
recalled
at
sir
terence
s
request
and
it
was
sir
terence
who
took
up
his
you
said
i
think
that
you
were
standing
in
the
guardroom
doorway
when
captain
tremayne
passed
you
at
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
on
the
night
of
the
yes
sir
i
had
turned
out
upon
hearing
the
curricle
draw
up
i
had
come
to
see
who
it
naturally
well
now
did
you
observe
which
way
captain
tremayne
went
whether
he
went
along
the
passage
leading
to
the
garden
or
up
the
stairs
to
the
offices
the
sergeant
considered
for
a
moment
and
captain
tremayne
became
conscious
for
the
first
time
that
morning
that
his
pulses
were
throbbing
at
last
his
dreadful
suspense
came
to
an
end
no
sir
captain
tremayne
turned
the
corner
and
was
out
of
my
sight
seeing
that
i
didn
t
go
beyond
the
guardroom
sir
terence
s
lips
parted
with
a
snap
of
impatience
but
you
must
have
heard
he
insisted
you
must
have
heard
his
steps
whether
they
went
upstairs
or
straight
i
am
afraid
i
didn
t
take
notice
but
even
without
taking
notice
it
seems
impossible
that
you
should
not
have
heard
the
direction
of
his
steps
steps
going
up
stairs
sound
quite
differently
from
steps
walking
along
the
level
try
to
the
sergeant
considered
again
but
the
president
interposed
the
testiness
which
sir
terence
had
been
at
no
pains
to
conceal
annoyed
sir
harry
and
this
insistence
offended
his
sense
of
fair
play
the
witness
has
already
said
that
the
didn
t
take
notice
i
am
afraid
it
can
serve
no
good
purpose
to
compel
him
to
strain
his
memory
the
court
could
hardly
rely
upon
his
answer
after
what
he
has
said
very
well
said
sir
terence
curtly
we
will
pass
on
after
the
body
of
count
samoval
had
been
removed
from
the
courtyard
did
mullins
my
butler
come
to
you
yes
sir
what
was
his
message
please
tell
the
he
brought
me
a
letter
with
instructions
that
it
was
to
be
forwarded
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
the
s
did
he
make
any
statement
beyond
that
when
he
delivered
that
letter
the
sergeant
pondered
a
moment
only
that
he
had
been
bringing
it
when
he
found
count
samoval
s
that
is
all
i
wish
to
ask
sir
harry
o
moy
intimated
and
looked
round
at
his
of
that
court
as
if
to
inquire
whether
they
had
drawn
any
inference
from
the
sergeant
s
statements
have
you
any
questions
to
ask
the
witness
captain
tremayne
the
president
inquired
none
sir
replied
the
prisoner
came
private
bates
next
and
sir
terence
proceeded
to
question
you
said
in
your
evidence
that
captain
tremayne
arrived
at
monsanto
between
eleven
and
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
yes
you
told
us
i
think
that
you
determined
this
by
the
fact
that
you
came
on
duty
at
eleven
o
clock
and
that
it
would
be
or
a
little
more
after
that
when
captain
tremayne
arrived
yes
that
is
quite
in
agreement
with
the
evidence
of
your
sergeant
now
tell
the
court
where
you
were
during
the
that
followed
until
you
heard
the
guard
being
turned
out
by
the
pacing
in
front
of
quarters
did
you
notice
the
windows
of
the
building
at
all
during
that
time
i
can
t
say
that
i
did
why
not
why
not
echoed
the
private
yes
why
not
don
t
repeat
my
words
how
did
it
happen
that
you
didn
t
notice
the
windows
because
they
were
in
darkness
o
moy
s
eyes
gleamed
all
of
them
certainly
sir
all
of
you
are
quite
certain
of
that
oh
quite
certain
sir
if
a
light
had
shown
from
one
of
them
i
couldn
t
have
failed
to
notice
that
will
captain
tremayne
began
the
president
i
have
no
questions
for
the
witness
sir
tremayne
announced
sir
harry
s
face
expressed
surprise
after
the
statement
he
has
just
made
he
exclaimed
and
thereupon
he
again
invited
the
prisoner
in
a
voice
that
was
as
grave
as
his
countenance
to
he
witness
he
did
more
than
invite
he
seemed
almost
to
plead
but
tremayne
preserving
by
a
miracle
his
outward
calm
for
all
that
inwardly
he
was
filled
with
despair
and
chagrin
to
see
what
a
pit
he
had
dug
for
himself
by
his
falsehood
declined
to
ask
any
questions
private
bates
retired
and
mullins
was
recalled
a
gloom
seemed
to
have
settled
now
upon
the
court
a
moment
ago
their
way
had
seemed
fairly
clear
to
its
members
and
they
had
been
inwardly
congratulating
themselves
that
they
were
relieved
from
the
grim
necessity
of
passing
sentence
upon
a
brother
officer
esteemed
by
all
who
knew
him
but
now
a
subtle
change
had
crept
in
the
statement
drawn
by
sir
terence
from
the
sentry
appeared
flatly
to
contradict
captain
tremayne
s
own
account
of
his
movements
on
the
night
in
question
you
told
the
court
o
moy
addressed
the
witness
mullins
consulting
his
notes
as
he
did
so
that
on
the
night
on
which
count
samoval
met
his
death
i
sent
you
at
ten
minutes
past
twelve
to
take
a
letter
to
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
an
urgent
letter
which
was
to
be
forwarded
to
its
destination
first
thing
on
the
following
morning
and
it
was
in
fact
in
the
course
of
going
upon
this
errand
that
you
discovered
the
prisoner
kneeling
beside
the
body
of
count
samoval
this
is
correct
is
it
not
it
is
will
you
now
inform
the
court
to
whom
that
letter
was
addressed
it
was
addressed
to
the
you
read
the
superscription
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
did
that
but
i
clearly
remember
sir
that
you
told
me
at
the
time
that
it
was
for
the
sir
terence
signified
that
he
had
no
more
to
ask
and
again
the
president
invited
the
prisoner
to
question
the
witness
to
receive
again
the
prisoner
s
unvarying
refusal
and
now
o
moy
rose
in
his
place
to
announce
that
he
had
himself
a
further
statement
to
make
to
the
court
a
statement
which
he
had
not
conceived
necessary
until
he
had
heard
the
prisoner
s
account
of
his
movements
during
the
he
had
spent
at
monsanto
on
the
night
of
the
duel
you
have
heard
from
sergeant
flynn
and
my
butler
mullins
that
the
letter
carried
from
me
by
the
latter
to
the
former
on
the
night
of
the
was
a
letter
for
the
of
an
urgent
character
to
be
forwarded
first
thing
in
the
morning
if
the
prisoner
insists
upon
it
the
himself
may
be
brought
before
this
court
to
confirm
my
assertion
that
that
communication
concerned
a
complaint
from
headquarters
on
the
subject
of
the
tents
supplied
to
the
third
division
sir
thomas
picton
s
at
celorico
the
documents
concerning
that
complaint
that
is
to
say
the
documents
upon
which
we
are
to
presume
that
the
prisoner
was
at
work
during
tine
in
question
were
at
the
time
in
my
possession
in
my
own
private
study
and
in
another
wing
of
the
building
sir
terence
sat
down
amid
a
rustling
stir
that
ran
through
the
court
but
was
instantly
summoned
to
his
feet
again
by
the
president
a
moment
sir
terence
the
prisoner
will
no
doubt
desire
to
question
you
on
that
and
he
looked
with
serious
eyes
at
captain
tremayne
i
have
no
questions
for
sir
terence
sir
was
his
answer
indeed
what
question
could
he
have
asked
the
falsehoods
he
had
uttered
had
woven
themselves
into
a
rope
about
his
neck
and
he
stood
before
his
brother
officers
now
in
an
agony
of
shame
a
man
discredited
as
he
believed
but
no
doubt
you
will
desire
the
presence
of
the
this
was
from
colonel
fletcher
his
own
colonel
and
a
man
who
esteemed
him
and
it
was
asked
in
accents
that
were
pleadingly
insistent
what
purpose
could
it
serve
sir
sir
terence
s
words
are
partly
confirmed
by
the
evidence
he
has
just
elicited
from
sergeant
flynn
and
his
butler
mullins
since
he
spent
the
night
writing
a
letter
to
the
commissary
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
the
subject
would
be
such
as
he
states
since
from
my
own
knowledge
it
was
the
most
urgent
matter
in
our
hands
and
naturally
he
would
not
have
written
without
having
the
documents
at
his
side
to
summon
the
would
be
unnecessarily
to
waste
the
time
of
the
court
it
follows
that
i
must
have
been
mistaken
and
this
i
but
how
could
you
be
mistaken
broke
from
the
president
i
realise
your
difficulty
in
crediting
it
but
there
it
is
mistaken
i
very
well
sir
harry
paused
and
then
added
the
court
will
be
glad
to
hear
you
in
answer
to
the
further
evidence
adduced
to
refute
your
statement
in
your
own
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
sir
was
tremayne
s
answer
nothing
further
the
president
seemed
aghast
nothing
and
now
colonel
fletcher
leaned
forward
to
exhort
him
captain
tremayne
he
said
let
me
beg
you
to
realise
the
serious
position
in
which
you
are
i
assure
you
sir
that
i
realise
it
do
you
realise
that
the
statements
you
have
made
to
account
for
your
movements
during
the
that
you
were
at
monsanto
have
been
disproved
you
have
heard
private
bates
s
evidence
to
the
effect
that
at
the
time
when
you
say
you
were
at
work
in
the
offices
those
offices
remained
in
darkness
and
you
have
heard
sir
terence
s
statement
that
the
documents
upon
which
you
claim
to
have
been
at
work
were
at
the
time
in
his
own
hands
do
you
realise
what
inference
the
court
will
be
compelled
to
draw
from
this
the
court
must
draw
whatever
inference
it
pleases
answered
the
captain
without
heat
sir
terence
stirred
captain
tremayne
said
he
i
wish
to
add
my
own
exhortation
to
that
of
your
colonel
your
position
has
become
extremely
perilous
if
you
are
concealing
anything
that
may
extricate
you
from
it
let
me
enjoin
you
to
take
the
court
frankly
and
fully
into
your
the
words
in
themselves
were
kindly
but
through
them
ran
a
note
of
bitterness
of
cruel
derision
that
was
faintly
perceptible
to
tremayne
and
to
one
or
two
others
lord
wellington
s
piercing
eyes
looked
a
moment
at
o
moy
then
turned
upon
the
prisoner
suddenly
he
spoke
his
voice
as
calm
and
level
as
his
glance
captain
tremayne
if
the
president
will
permit
me
to
address
you
in
the
interests
of
truth
and
justice
you
bear
to
my
knowledge
the
reputation
of
an
upright
honourable
man
you
are
a
man
so
unaccustomed
to
falsehood
that
when
you
adventure
upon
it
as
you
have
obviously
just
done
your
performance
is
a
clumsy
one
its
faults
easily
distinguished
that
you
are
concealing
something
the
court
must
have
perceived
if
you
are
not
concealing
something
other
than
that
count
samoval
fell
by
your
hand
let
me
enjoin
you
to
speak
out
if
you
are
shielding
any
one
perhaps
the
real
perpetrator
of
this
deed
let
me
assure
you
that
your
honour
as
a
soldier
demands
in
the
interests
of
truth
and
justice
that
you
should
not
continue
tremayne
looked
into
the
stern
face
of
the
great
soldier
and
his
glance
fell
away
he
made
a
little
gesture
of
helplessness
then
drew
himself
stiffly
up
i
have
nothing
more
to
then
captain
tremayne
said
the
president
the
court
will
pass
to
the
consideration
of
its
finding
and
if
you
can
not
account
for
the
that
you
spent
at
monsanto
while
count
samoval
was
meeting
his
death
i
am
afraid
that
in
view
of
all
the
other
evidences
against
you
your
position
is
likely
to
be
one
of
extremest
gravity
for
the
last
time
sir
before
i
order
your
removal
let
me
add
my
own
to
the
exhortations
already
addressed
to
you
that
you
should
speak
if
still
you
elect
to
remain
silent
the
court
i
fear
will
be
unable
to
draw
any
conclusion
but
one
from
your
for
a
long
moment
captain
tremayne
stood
there
in
tense
expectant
silence
yet
he
was
not
considering
he
was
waiting
lady
o
moy
he
knew
to
be
in
court
behind
him
she
had
heard
even
as
he
had
heard
that
his
fate
hung
perhaps
upon
whether
richard
butler
s
presence
were
to
be
betrayed
or
not
not
for
him
to
break
faith
with
her
let
her
decide
and
awaiting
that
decision
he
stood
there
silent
like
a
man
considering
and
then
because
no
woman
s
voice
broke
the
silence
to
proclaim
at
once
his
innocence
and
the
alibi
that
must
ensure
his
acquittal
he
spoke
at
last
i
thank
you
sir
indeed
i
am
very
grateful
to
the
court
for
the
consideration
it
has
shown
me
i
appreciate
it
deeply
but
i
have
nothing
more
to
and
then
when
all
seemed
lost
a
woman
s
voice
rang
out
at
last
but
i
have
its
sharp
almost
strident
note
acted
like
an
electric
discharge
upon
the
court
but
no
member
of
the
assembly
was
more
deeply
stricken
than
captain
tremayne
for
though
the
voice
was
a
woman
s
yet
it
was
not
the
voice
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
in
his
excitement
he
turned
to
see
miss
armytage
standing
there
straight
and
stiff
her
white
face
stamped
with
purpose
and
beside
her
still
seated
clutching
her
arm
in
an
agony
of
fear
lady
o
moy
murmuring
for
all
to
hear
her
no
no
sylvia
be
silent
for
god
s
sake
but
sylvia
had
risen
to
speak
and
speak
she
did
and
though
the
words
she
uttered
were
such
as
a
virgin
might
wish
to
whisper
with
veiled
countenance
and
averted
glance
yet
her
utterance
of
them
was
bold
to
the
point
of
defiance
i
can
tell
you
why
captain
tremayne
is
silent
i
can
tell
you
whom
he
oh
god
gasped
lady
o
moy
wondering
through
her
anguish
how
sylvia
could
have
become
possessed
of
her
secret
miss
armytage
i
implore
you
cried
tremayne
forgetting
where
he
stood
his
voice
shaking
at
last
his
hand
flung
out
to
silence
her
and
then
the
heavy
voice
of
o
moy
crashed
in
let
her
speak
let
us
have
the
truth
the
truth
and
he
smote
the
table
with
his
clenched
fist
and
you
shall
have
it
answered
miss
armytage
captain
tremayne
keeps
silent
to
shield
a
woman
his
sir
terence
sucked
in
his
breath
with
a
whistling
sound
lady
o
moy
desisted
from
her
attempts
to
check
the
speaker
and
fell
to
staring
at
her
in
stony
astonishment
whilst
tremayne
was
too
overcome
by
the
same
emotion
to
think
of
interrupting
the
others
preserved
a
watchful
unbroken
silence
captain
tremayne
spent
that
at
monsanto
in
her
room
he
was
with
her
when
he
heard
the
cry
that
took
him
to
the
window
thence
he
saw
the
body
in
the
courtyard
and
in
alarm
went
down
at
once
without
considering
the
consequences
to
the
woman
but
because
he
has
considered
them
since
he
now
keeps
sir
sir
captain
tremayne
turned
in
wild
appeal
to
the
president
this
is
not
he
conceived
at
once
the
terrible
mistake
that
miss
armytage
had
made
she
must
have
seen
him
climb
down
from
lady
o
moy
s
balcony
and
she
had
come
to
the
only
possible
horrible
conclusion
this
lady
is
mistaken
i
am
ready
to
a
moment
sir
you
are
interrupting
the
president
rebuked
and
then
the
voice
of
o
moy
on
the
note
of
terrible
triumph
sounded
again
like
a
trumpet
through
the
long
room
ah
but
it
is
the
truth
at
last
we
have
it
now
her
name
her
name
he
shouted
who
was
this
wanton
miss
armytage
s
answer
was
as
a
to
his
ferocious
exultation
myself
captain
tremayne
was
with
chapter
xviii
fool
s
mate
writing
years
afterwards
of
this
event
in
the
rather
tedious
volume
of
reminiscences
which
he
has
left
us
major
carruthers
ventures
the
opinion
that
the
court
should
never
have
been
deceived
that
it
should
have
perceived
at
once
that
miss
armytage
was
lying
he
argues
this
opinion
upon
psychological
grounds
contending
that
the
lady
s
deportment
in
that
moment
of
was
the
very
last
that
in
the
circumstances
she
alleged
would
have
been
natural
to
such
a
character
as
her
own
had
she
indeed
he
writes
been
tremayne
s
mistress
as
she
represented
herself
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
have
announced
it
after
the
manner
in
which
she
did
so
she
bore
herself
before
us
with
all
the
effrontery
of
a
harlot
and
it
was
well
known
to
most
of
us
that
a
more
pure
chaste
and
modest
lady
did
not
live
there
was
here
a
contradiction
so
flagrant
that
it
should
have
rendered
her
falsehood
immediately
major
carruthers
of
course
is
writing
in
the
light
of
later
knowledge
and
even
setting
that
aside
i
am
very
far
from
agreeing
with
his
psychological
deduction
just
as
a
shy
man
will
so
overreach
himself
in
his
efforts
to
dissemble
his
shyness
as
to
assume
an
air
of
positive
arrogance
so
might
a
pure
lady
who
had
succumbed
as
miss
armytage
pretended
upon
finding
herself
forced
to
such
bear
herself
with
a
boldness
which
was
no
more
than
a
mask
upon
the
shame
and
anguish
of
her
mind
and
this
i
think
was
the
view
that
was
taken
by
those
present
the
court
it
was
being
composed
of
honest
gentlemen
that
felt
the
shame
which
she
dissembled
there
were
the
eyes
that
fell
away
before
the
spurious
effrontery
of
her
own
glance
they
were
disconcerted
one
and
all
by
this
turn
of
events
without
precedent
in
the
experience
of
any
and
none
more
disconcerted
though
not
in
the
same
sense
than
sir
terence
to
him
this
was
checkmate
fool
s
mate
indeed
an
unexpected
yet
ridiculously
simple
move
had
utterly
routed
him
at
the
very
outset
of
the
deadly
game
that
he
was
playing
he
had
sat
there
determined
to
have
either
tremayne
s
life
or
the
truth
publicly
avowed
of
tremayne
s
dastardly
betrayal
he
could
not
have
told
you
which
he
preferred
but
one
or
the
other
he
was
fiercely
determined
to
have
and
now
the
springs
of
the
snare
in
which
he
had
so
cunningly
taken
tremayne
had
been
forced
apart
by
utterly
unexpected
hands
it
s
a
lie
he
bellowed
angrily
but
he
bellowed
it
seemed
upon
deaf
ears
the
court
just
sat
and
stared
utterly
and
hopelessly
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
and
then
the
dry
voice
of
wellington
followed
sir
terence
cutting
sharply
upon
the
dismayed
silence
how
can
you
know
that
he
asked
the
adjutant
the
matter
is
one
upon
which
few
would
be
qualified
to
contradict
miss
armytage
you
will
observe
sir
harry
that
even
captain
tremayne
has
not
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
do
those
words
pulled
the
captain
from
the
spell
of
sheer
horrified
amazement
in
which
he
had
stood
stricken
dumb
ever
since
miss
armytage
had
spoken
i
i
am
so
overwhelmed
by
the
amazing
falsehood
with
which
miss
armytage
has
attempted
to
save
me
from
the
predicament
in
which
i
stand
for
it
is
that
gentlemen
on
my
oath
as
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
there
is
not
a
word
of
truth
in
what
miss
armytage
has
but
if
there
were
said
lord
wellington
who
seemed
the
only
person
present
to
retain
a
cool
command
of
his
wits
your
honour
as
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
and
this
lady
s
honour
must
still
demand
of
you
the
but
my
lord
i
protest
you
are
interrupting
me
i
think
lord
wellington
rebuked
him
coldly
and
under
the
habit
of
obedience
and
the
magnetic
eye
of
his
lordship
the
captain
lapsed
into
anguished
silence
i
am
of
opinion
gentlemen
his
lordship
addressed
the
court
that
this
affair
has
gone
quite
far
enough
miss
armytage
s
testimony
has
saved
a
deal
of
trouble
it
has
shed
light
upon
much
that
was
obscure
and
it
has
provided
captain
tremayne
with
an
unanswerable
alibi
in
my
view
and
without
wishing
unduly
to
influence
the
court
in
its
decision
it
but
remains
to
pronounce
captain
tremayne
s
acquittal
thereby
enabling
him
to
fulfil
towards
this
lady
a
duty
which
the
circumstances
would
seem
to
have
rendered
somewhat
they
were
words
that
lifted
an
intolerable
burden
from
sir
harry
s
shoulders
in
immense
relief
eager
now
to
make
an
end
he
looked
to
right
and
left
everywhere
he
met
nodding
heads
and
murmurs
of
yes
everywhere
with
one
exception
sir
terence
white
to
the
lips
gave
no
sign
of
assent
and
yet
dared
give
none
of
dissent
the
eye
of
lord
wellington
was
upon
him
compelling
him
by
its
eagle
glance
we
are
clearly
agreed
the
president
began
but
captain
tremayne
interrupted
him
but
you
are
wrongly
sir
sir
you
shall
listen
it
is
infamous
that
i
should
owe
my
acquittal
to
the
sacrifice
of
this
lady
s
good
damme
that
is
a
matter
that
any
parson
can
put
right
said
his
lordship
your
lordship
is
mistaken
captain
tremayne
insisted
greatly
daring
the
honour
of
this
lady
is
more
dear
to
me
than
my
so
we
perceive
was
the
dry
rejoinder
these
outbursts
do
you
a
certain
credit
captain
tremayne
but
they
waste
the
time
of
the
and
then
the
president
made
his
announcement
captain
tremayne
you
are
acquitted
of
the
charge
of
killing
count
samoval
and
you
are
at
liberty
to
depart
and
to
resume
your
usual
duties
the
court
congratulates
you
and
congratulates
itself
upon
having
reached
this
conclusion
in
the
case
of
an
officer
so
estimable
as
ah
but
gentlemen
hear
me
yet
a
moment
you
my
lord
the
court
has
pronounced
the
matter
is
at
an
end
said
wellington
with
a
shrug
and
immediately
upon
the
words
he
rose
and
the
court
rose
with
him
immediately
with
rattle
of
sabres
and
sabretaches
the
officers
who
had
composed
the
board
fell
into
groups
and
broke
into
conversation
out
of
a
spirit
of
consideration
for
tremayne
and
definitely
to
mark
the
conclusion
of
the
proceedings
tremayne
white
and
trembling
turned
in
time
to
see
miss
armytage
leaving
the
hall
and
assisting
colonel
grant
to
support
lady
o
moy
who
was
in
a
condition
he
stood
irresolute
prey
to
a
torturing
agony
of
mind
cursing
himself
now
for
his
silence
for
not
having
spoken
the
truth
and
taken
the
consequences
together
with
dick
butler
what
was
dick
butler
to
him
what
was
his
own
life
to
him
if
they
should
demand
it
for
the
grave
breach
of
duty
he
had
committed
by
his
readiness
to
assist
a
proscribed
offender
to
escape
compared
with
the
honour
of
sylvia
armytage
and
she
why
had
she
done
this
for
him
could
it
be
possible
that
she
cared
that
she
was
concerned
so
much
for
his
life
as
to
immolate
her
honour
to
deliver
him
from
peril
the
event
would
seem
to
prove
it
yet
the
overmastering
joy
that
at
any
other
time
and
in
any
other
circumstances
such
a
revelation
must
have
procured
him
was
stifled
now
by
his
agonised
concern
for
the
injustice
to
which
she
had
submitted
herself
and
then
as
he
stood
there
a
suffering
bewildered
man
came
carruthers
to
grasp
his
hand
and
in
terms
of
warm
friendship
to
express
satisfaction
at
his
acquittal
sooner
than
have
such
a
price
as
that
paid
he
said
bitterly
and
with
a
shrug
left
his
sentence
unfinished
o
moy
came
stalking
past
him
with
eyes
that
looked
neither
to
right
nor
left
o
moy
he
cried
sir
terence
checked
and
stood
stiffly
as
if
to
attention
his
handsome
blue
eyes
blazing
into
the
captain
s
own
thus
a
moment
then
we
will
talk
of
this
again
you
and
i
he
said
grimly
and
passed
on
and
out
with
clanking
step
leaving
tremayne
to
reflect
that
the
appearances
certainly
justified
sir
terence
s
resentment
my
god
carruthers
what
must
he
think
of
me
he
ejaculated
if
you
ask
me
i
think
that
he
has
suspected
this
from
the
very
beginning
only
that
could
account
for
the
hostility
of
his
attitude
towards
you
for
the
persistence
with
which
he
has
sought
either
to
convict
or
wring
the
truth
from
tremayne
looked
askance
at
the
major
in
such
a
tangle
as
this
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
attention
fixed
upon
any
single
thread
his
mind
must
be
disabused
at
once
he
answered
i
must
go
to
o
moy
had
already
vanished
there
were
one
or
two
others
would
have
checked
the
adjutant
s
departure
but
he
had
heeded
none
in
the
quadrangle
he
nodded
curtly
to
colonel
grant
who
would
have
detained
him
but
he
passed
on
and
went
to
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
with
his
mental
anguish
that
was
compounded
of
so
many
and
so
diverse
emotions
he
needed
above
all
things
to
be
alone
and
to
think
if
thought
were
possible
to
a
mind
so
distraught
as
his
own
there
were
now
so
many
things
to
be
faced
considered
and
dealt
with
first
and
foremost
and
this
was
perhaps
the
product
of
inevitable
reaction
was
the
consideration
of
his
own
duplicity
his
villainous
betrayal
of
trust
undertaken
deliberately
but
with
an
aim
very
different
from
that
which
would
appear
he
perceived
how
men
must
assume
now
when
the
truth
of
samoval
s
death
became
known
as
become
known
it
must
that
he
had
deliberately
fastened
upon
another
his
own
crime
the
fine
edifice
of
vengeance
he
had
been
so
skilfully
erecting
had
toppled
about
his
ears
in
obscene
ruin
and
he
was
a
man
not
only
broken
but
dishonoured
let
him
proclaim
the
truth
now
and
none
would
believe
it
sylvia
armytage
s
mad
and
inexplicable
was
a
final
bar
to
that
men
of
honour
would
scorn
him
his
friends
would
turn
from
him
in
disgust
and
wellington
that
great
soldier
whom
he
worshipped
and
whose
esteem
he
valued
above
all
possessions
would
be
the
first
to
cast
him
out
he
would
appear
as
a
vulgar
murderer
who
having
failed
by
falsehood
to
fasten
the
guilt
upon
an
innocent
man
sought
now
by
falsehood
still
more
damnable
at
the
cost
of
his
wife
s
honour
to
offer
some
mitigation
of
his
unspeakable
offence
conceive
this
terrible
position
in
which
his
justifiable
jealousy
his
naturally
vindictive
rage
had
so
irretrievably
ensnared
him
he
had
been
so
intent
upon
the
administration
of
poetic
justice
so
intent
upon
condignly
punishing
the
false
friend
who
had
dishonoured
him
upon
finding
a
balm
for
his
lacerated
soul
in
the
spectacle
of
tremayne
s
own
ignominy
that
he
had
never
paused
to
see
whither
all
this
might
lead
him
he
had
been
a
fool
to
have
adopted
these
subtle
tortuous
ways
a
fool
not
to
have
obeyed
the
earlier
and
honest
impulse
which
had
led
him
to
take
that
case
of
pistols
from
the
drawer
and
he
was
served
as
a
fool
deserves
to
be
served
his
folly
had
recoiled
upon
him
to
destroy
him
fool
s
mate
had
checked
his
perfidious
vengeance
at
a
blow
why
had
sylvia
armytage
discarded
her
honour
to
make
of
it
a
cloak
for
the
protection
of
tremayne
did
she
love
tremayne
and
take
that
desperate
way
to
save
a
life
she
accounted
lost
or
was
it
that
she
knew
the
truth
and
out
of
affection
for
una
had
chosen
to
immolate
herself
sir
terence
was
no
psychologist
but
he
found
it
difficult
to
believe
in
so
much
of
from
a
woman
for
a
woman
s
sake
however
dear
therefore
he
held
to
the
first
alternative
to
confirm
it
came
the
memory
of
sylvia
s
words
to
him
on
the
night
of
tremayne
s
arrest
and
it
was
to
such
a
man
that
she
gave
the
priceless
treasure
of
her
love
for
such
a
man
and
in
such
a
sordid
cause
that
she
sacrificed
the
inestimable
jewel
of
her
honour
he
laughed
through
clenched
teeth
at
a
situation
so
bitterly
ironical
presently
he
would
talk
to
her
she
should
realise
what
she
had
done
and
he
would
wish
her
joy
of
it
first
however
there
was
something
else
to
do
he
flung
himself
wearily
into
the
chair
at
his
took
up
a
pen
and
began
to
write
chapter
xix
the
truth
to
captain
tremayne
fretted
with
impatience
in
the
diningroom
came
at
the
end
of
a
long
hour
of
waiting
sylvia
armytage
she
entered
unannounced
at
a
moment
when
for
the
third
time
he
was
on
the
point
of
ringing
for
mullins
and
for
a
moment
they
stood
considering
each
other
mutually
ill
at
ease
then
miss
armytage
closed
the
door
and
came
forward
moving
with
that
grace
peculiar
to
her
and
carrying
her
head
erect
facing
captain
tremayne
now
with
some
lingering
signs
of
the
defiance
she
had
shown
the
members
of
the
mullins
tells
me
that
you
wish
to
see
me
she
said
the
merest
conventionality
to
break
the
disconcerting
uneasy
silence
after
what
has
happened
that
should
not
surprise
you
said
tremayne
his
agitation
was
clear
to
behold
his
usual
imperturbability
all
departed
why
he
burst
out
suddenly
why
did
you
do
it
she
looked
at
him
with
the
faintest
ghost
of
a
smile
on
her
lips
as
if
she
found
the
question
amusing
but
before
she
could
frame
any
answer
he
was
speaking
again
quickly
and
nervously
could
you
suppose
that
i
should
wish
to
purchase
my
life
at
such
a
price
could
you
suppose
that
your
honour
was
not
more
precious
to
me
than
my
life
it
was
infamous
that
you
should
have
sacrificed
yourself
in
this
infamous
of
whom
she
asked
him
coolly
the
question
gave
him
pause
i
don
t
know
he
cried
desperately
infamous
of
the
circumstances
i
she
shrugged
the
circumstances
were
there
and
they
had
to
be
met
i
could
think
of
no
other
way
of
meeting
hastily
he
answered
her
out
of
his
anger
for
her
sake
it
should
not
have
been
your
affair
to
meet
them
at
he
saw
the
scarlet
flush
sweep
over
her
face
and
leave
it
deathly
white
and
instantly
he
perceived
how
horribly
he
had
blundered
i
m
sorry
to
have
been
interfering
she
answered
stiffly
but
after
all
it
is
not
a
matter
that
need
trouble
and
on
the
words
she
turned
to
depart
again
captain
ah
wait
he
flung
himself
between
her
and
the
door
we
must
understand
each
other
miss
i
think
we
do
captain
tremayne
she
answered
fire
dancing
in
her
eyes
and
she
added
you
are
detaining
he
was
calm
again
and
he
was
masterful
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
dealings
with
her
we
are
very
far
from
any
understanding
indeed
we
are
overhead
in
a
misunderstanding
already
you
misconstrue
my
words
i
am
very
angry
with
you
i
do
not
think
that
in
all
my
life
i
have
ever
been
so
angry
with
anybody
but
you
are
not
to
mistake
the
source
of
my
anger
i
am
angry
with
you
for
the
great
wrong
you
have
done
that
should
not
be
your
affair
she
answered
him
thus
flinging
back
the
offending
phrase
but
it
is
i
make
it
mine
he
insisted
then
i
do
not
give
you
the
right
please
let
me
she
looked
him
steadily
in
the
face
and
her
voice
was
calm
to
coldness
only
the
heave
of
her
bosom
betrayed
the
agitation
under
which
she
was
labouring
whether
you
give
me
the
right
or
not
i
intend
to
take
it
he
insisted
you
are
very
rude
she
reproved
him
he
laughed
even
at
the
risk
of
being
rude
then
i
must
make
myself
clear
to
you
i
would
suffer
anything
sooner
than
leave
you
under
any
misapprehension
of
the
grounds
upon
which
i
should
have
preferred
to
face
a
firing
party
rather
than
have
been
rescued
at
the
sacrifice
of
your
good
i
hope
she
said
with
faint
but
cutting
irony
you
do
not
intend
to
offer
me
the
reparation
of
it
took
his
breath
away
for
a
moment
it
was
a
solution
that
in
his
confused
and
irate
state
of
mind
he
had
never
even
paused
to
consider
yet
now
that
it
was
put
to
him
in
this
scornfully
reproachful
manner
he
perceived
not
only
that
it
was
the
only
possible
course
but
also
that
on
that
very
account
it
might
be
considered
by
her
impossible
her
testiness
was
suddenly
plain
to
him
she
feared
that
he
was
come
to
her
with
an
offer
of
marriage
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
as
an
amende
to
correct
the
false
position
into
which
for
his
sake
she
had
placed
herself
and
he
himself
by
his
blundering
phrase
had
given
colour
to
that
hideous
fear
of
hers
he
considered
a
moment
whilst
he
stood
there
meeting
her
defiant
glance
never
had
she
been
more
desirable
in
his
eyes
and
hopeless
as
his
love
for
her
had
always
seemed
never
had
it
been
in
such
danger
of
hopelessness
as
at
this
present
moment
unless
he
proceeded
here
with
the
utmost
care
and
so
ned
tremayne
became
subtle
for
the
first
time
in
his
honest
straightforward
soldierly
life
no
he
answered
boldly
i
do
not
intend
i
am
glad
that
you
spare
me
that
she
answered
him
yet
her
pallor
seemed
to
deepen
under
his
glance
and
that
he
continued
is
the
source
of
all
my
anger
against
you
against
myself
and
against
circumstances
if
i
had
deemed
myself
remotely
worthy
of
you
he
continued
i
should
have
asked
you
weeks
ago
to
be
my
wife
oh
wait
and
hear
me
out
i
have
more
than
once
been
upon
the
point
of
doing
so
the
last
time
was
that
night
on
the
balcony
at
count
redondo
s
i
would
have
spoken
then
i
would
have
taken
my
courage
in
my
hands
confessed
my
unworthiness
and
my
love
but
i
was
restrained
because
although
i
might
confess
there
was
nothing
i
could
ask
i
am
a
poor
man
sylvia
you
are
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
one
men
speak
of
you
as
an
heiress
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
he
broke
off
you
realise
that
i
could
not
that
i
should
have
been
deemed
a
not
only
by
the
world
which
matters
nothing
but
perhaps
by
yourself
who
matter
everything
i
i
he
faltered
fumbling
for
words
to
express
thoughts
of
an
overwhelming
intricacy
it
was
not
perhaps
that
so
much
as
the
thought
that
if
my
suit
should
come
to
prosper
men
would
say
you
had
thrown
yourself
away
on
a
to
myself
i
should
have
accounted
the
reproach
well
earned
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
must
contain
something
slighting
to
you
and
to
shield
you
from
all
slights
must
be
the
first
concern
of
my
deep
worship
for
you
that
he
ended
fiercely
is
why
i
am
so
angry
so
desperate
at
the
slight
you
have
put
upon
yourself
for
my
sake
for
me
who
would
have
sacrificed
life
and
honour
and
everything
i
hold
of
any
account
to
keep
you
up
there
enthroned
not
only
in
my
own
eyes
but
in
the
eyes
of
every
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
and
she
at
him
she
was
still
very
white
and
one
of
her
long
slender
hands
was
pressed
to
her
bosom
as
if
to
contain
and
repress
tumult
but
her
eyes
were
smiling
and
yet
it
was
a
smile
he
could
not
read
it
was
compassionate
wistful
and
yet
tinged
it
seemed
to
him
with
mockery
i
suppose
he
said
it
would
be
expected
of
me
in
the
circumstances
to
seek
words
in
which
to
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
but
i
have
no
such
words
i
am
not
grateful
how
could
i
be
grateful
you
have
destroyed
the
thing
that
i
most
valued
in
this
what
have
i
destroyed
she
asked
him
your
own
good
name
the
respect
that
was
your
due
from
all
yet
if
i
retain
your
own
what
is
that
worth
he
asked
almost
resentfully
perhaps
more
than
all
the
she
took
a
step
forward
and
set
her
hand
upon
his
arm
there
was
no
mistaking
now
her
smile
it
was
all
tenderness
and
her
eyes
were
shining
ned
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
he
looked
down
at
her
who
was
only
a
little
less
tall
than
himself
and
the
colour
faded
from
his
own
face
now
you
haven
t
understood
me
after
all
he
said
i
was
afraid
you
would
not
i
have
no
clear
gift
of
words
and
if
i
had
i
am
trying
to
say
something
that
would
overtax
any
on
the
contrary
ned
i
understand
you
perfectly
i
don
t
think
i
have
ever
understood
you
until
now
certainly
never
until
now
could
i
be
sure
of
what
i
of
what
you
hoped
his
voice
sank
as
if
in
awe
what
he
asked
she
looked
away
and
her
persisting
yet
smile
grew
slightly
arch
you
do
not
then
intend
to
ask
me
to
marry
you
she
said
how
could
i
it
was
an
explosion
almost
of
anger
you
yourself
suggested
that
it
would
be
an
insult
and
so
it
would
it
is
to
take
advantage
of
the
position
into
which
your
foolish
generosity
has
betrayed
you
oh
he
clenched
his
fists
and
shook
them
a
moment
at
his
sides
very
well
she
said
in
that
case
i
must
ask
you
to
marry
you
he
was
thunderstruck
what
alternative
do
you
leave
me
you
say
that
i
have
destroyed
my
good
name
you
must
provide
me
with
a
new
one
at
all
costs
i
must
become
an
honest
woman
isn
t
that
the
phrase
don
t
he
cried
and
pain
quivered
in
his
voice
don
t
jest
upon
my
dear
she
said
and
now
she
held
out
both
hands
to
him
why
trouble
yourself
with
things
of
no
account
when
the
only
thing
that
matters
to
us
is
within
our
grasp
we
love
each
other
and
her
glance
fell
away
her
lip
trembled
and
her
smile
at
last
took
flight
he
caught
her
hands
holding
them
in
a
grip
that
hurt
her
he
bent
his
head
and
his
eyes
sought
her
own
but
sought
in
vain
have
you
considered
he
was
beginning
when
she
interrupted
him
her
face
flushed
upward
surrendering
to
that
questing
glance
of
his
and
its
expression
was
now
between
tears
and
laughter
you
will
be
for
ever
considering
ned
you
consider
too
much
where
the
issues
are
plain
and
simple
for
the
last
time
will
you
marry
me
the
subtlety
he
had
employed
had
been
greater
than
he
knew
and
it
had
achieved
something
beyond
his
utmost
hopes
he
murmured
incoherently
and
took
her
to
his
arms
i
really
do
not
see
that
he
could
have
done
anything
else
it
was
a
plain
and
simple
issue
and
she
herself
had
protested
that
the
issue
was
plain
and
simple
and
then
the
door
opened
abruptly
and
sir
terence
came
in
nor
did
he
discreetly
withdraw
as
a
man
of
feeling
should
have
done
before
the
intimate
and
touching
spectacle
that
met
his
eyes
on
the
contrary
he
remained
like
the
infernal
marplot
that
he
intended
to
be
very
proper
he
sneered
very
fit
and
proper
that
he
should
put
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
reputation
you
have
damaged
for
his
sake
sylvia
i
suppose
you
re
to
be
they
moved
apart
and
each
stared
at
o
moy
sylvia
in
cold
anger
tremayne
in
chagrin
you
see
sylvia
the
captain
cried
at
this
voicing
of
the
world
s
opinion
he
feared
so
much
on
her
behalf
does
she
said
sir
terence
misunderstanding
i
wonder
unless
you
ve
made
all
the
captain
frowned
made
what
plain
he
asked
there
is
something
here
i
don
t
understand
o
moy
your
attitude
towards
me
ever
since
you
ordered
me
under
arrest
has
been
entirely
extraordinary
it
has
troubled
me
more
than
anything
else
in
all
this
deplorable
i
believe
you
snorted
o
moy
as
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
he
strode
forward
into
the
room
he
was
pale
and
there
was
a
set
malignant
sneer
upon
his
lip
a
malignant
look
in
the
blue
eyes
that
were
habitually
so
clear
and
honest
there
have
been
moments
said
tremayne
when
i
have
almost
felt
you
to
be
d
ye
wonder
growled
o
moy
has
no
suspicion
crossed
your
mind
that
i
may
know
the
whole
truth
tremayne
was
taken
aback
that
startles
you
eh
cried
o
moy
and
pointed
a
mocking
finger
at
the
captain
s
face
whose
whole
expression
had
changed
to
one
of
apprehension
what
is
it
cried
sylvia
instinctively
she
felt
that
under
this
troubled
surface
some
evil
thing
was
stirring
that
the
issues
perhaps
were
not
quite
as
simple
as
she
had
deemed
them
there
was
a
pause
o
moy
with
his
back
to
the
window
now
his
hands
still
clasped
behind
him
looked
mockingly
at
tremayne
and
waited
why
don
t
you
answer
her
he
said
at
last
you
were
confidential
enough
when
i
came
in
can
it
be
that
you
are
keeping
something
back
that
you
have
secrets
from
the
lady
who
has
no
doubt
promised
by
now
to
become
your
wife
as
the
shortest
way
to
mending
her
recent
folly
tremayne
was
bewildered
his
answer
apparently
an
irrelevance
was
the
mere
enunciation
of
the
thoughts
o
moy
s
announcement
had
provoked
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
known
throughout
that
i
did
not
kill
samoval
he
asked
of
course
how
could
i
have
supposed
you
killed
him
when
i
killed
him
myself
you
you
killed
him
cried
tremayne
more
and
more
intrigued
and
you
killed
count
samoval
exclaimed
miss
armytage
to
be
sure
i
did
was
the
answer
cynically
delivered
accompanied
by
a
short
sharp
laugh
when
i
have
settled
other
accounts
and
put
all
my
affairs
in
order
i
shall
save
the
the
trouble
of
further
seeking
the
slayer
and
you
didn
t
know
then
sylvia
when
you
lied
so
glibly
to
the
court
that
your
future
husband
was
innocent
of
that
i
was
always
sure
of
it
she
answered
and
looked
at
tremayne
for
explanation
o
moy
laughed
again
but
he
had
not
told
you
so
he
preferred
that
you
should
think
him
guilty
of
bloodshed
of
murder
even
rather
than
tell
you
the
real
truth
oh
i
can
understand
he
is
the
very
soul
of
honour
as
you
remarked
yourself
i
think
the
other
night
he
knows
how
much
to
tell
and
how
much
to
withhold
he
is
master
of
the
art
of
discreet
suppression
he
will
carry
it
to
any
lengths
you
had
an
instance
of
that
before
the
court
this
morning
you
may
come
to
regret
my
dear
that
you
did
not
allow
him
to
have
his
own
obstinate
way
that
you
should
have
dragged
your
own
spotless
purity
in
the
mud
to
provide
him
with
an
alibi
but
he
had
an
alibi
all
the
time
my
child
an
unanswerable
alibi
which
he
preferred
to
withhold
i
wonder
would
you
have
been
so
ready
to
make
a
shield
of
your
honour
could
you
have
known
what
you
were
really
shielding
ned
she
cried
why
don
t
you
speak
is
he
to
go
on
in
this
fashion
of
what
is
he
accusing
you
if
you
were
not
with
samoval
that
night
where
were
you
in
a
lady
s
room
as
you
correctly
informed
the
court
came
o
moy
s
bitter
mockery
your
only
mistake
was
in
the
identity
of
the
lady
you
imagined
that
the
lady
was
yourself
a
delusion
purely
but
you
and
i
may
comfort
each
other
for
we
are
at
the
hands
of
this
man
of
honour
my
wife
was
the
lady
who
entertained
this
gallant
in
her
room
that
my
god
o
moy
it
was
a
strangled
cry
from
tremayne
at
last
he
saw
light
he
understood
and
understanding
there
entered
his
heart
a
great
compassion
for
o
moy
a
conception
that
he
must
have
suffered
all
the
agonies
of
the
damned
in
these
last
few
days
my
god
you
don
t
believe
that
i
do
you
deny
it
the
imputation
and
if
i
tell
you
that
myself
with
these
eyes
i
saw
you
at
the
window
of
her
room
with
her
if
i
tell
you
that
i
saw
the
rope
ladder
dangling
from
her
balcony
if
i
tell
you
that
crouching
there
after
i
had
killed
samoval
killed
him
mark
me
for
saying
that
you
and
my
wife
betrayed
me
killed
him
for
telling
me
the
filthy
truth
if
i
tell
you
that
i
heard
her
attempting
to
restrain
you
from
going
down
to
see
what
had
happened
if
i
tell
you
all
this
will
you
still
deny
it
will
you
still
lie
i
will
still
say
that
all
that
you
imply
is
false
as
hell
and
your
own
senseless
jealousy
can
make
it
all
that
i
imply
but
what
i
state
the
facts
themselves
are
they
true
they
are
true
but
true
cried
miss
armytage
in
horror
ah
wait
o
moy
bade
her
with
his
heavy
sneer
you
interrupt
him
he
is
about
to
construe
those
facts
so
that
they
shall
wear
an
innocent
appearance
he
is
about
to
prove
himself
worthy
of
the
great
sacrifice
you
made
to
save
his
life
well
and
he
looked
expectantly
at
tremayne
miss
armytage
looked
at
him
too
with
eyes
from
which
the
dread
passed
almost
at
once
the
captain
was
smiling
wistfully
tolerantly
confidently
almost
scornfully
had
he
been
guilty
of
the
thing
imputed
he
could
not
have
stood
so
in
her
presence
o
moy
he
said
slowly
i
should
tell
you
that
you
have
played
the
knave
in
this
were
it
not
clear
to
me
that
you
have
played
the
he
spoke
entirely
without
passion
he
saw
his
way
quite
clearly
things
had
reached
a
pass
in
which
for
the
sake
of
all
concerned
and
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
miss
armytage
more
than
any
one
the
whole
truth
must
be
spoken
without
regard
to
its
consequences
to
richard
butler
you
dare
to
take
that
tone
began
o
moy
in
a
voice
of
thunder
yourself
shall
be
the
first
to
justify
it
presently
i
should
be
angry
with
you
o
moy
for
what
you
have
done
but
i
find
my
anger
vanishing
in
regret
i
should
scorn
you
for
the
lie
you
have
acted
for
your
scant
regard
to
your
oath
in
the
for
your
attempt
to
combat
an
imagined
villainy
by
a
real
villainy
but
i
realise
what
you
have
suffered
and
in
that
suffering
lies
the
punishment
you
fully
deserve
for
not
having
taken
the
straight
course
for
not
having
taxed
me
there
and
then
with
the
thing
that
you
the
gentleman
is
about
to
lecture
me
upon
morals
but
tremayne
let
pass
the
interruption
it
is
quite
true
that
i
was
in
una
s
room
while
you
were
killing
samoval
but
i
was
not
alone
with
her
as
you
have
so
rashly
assumed
her
brother
richard
was
there
and
it
was
on
his
behalf
that
i
was
present
she
had
been
hiding
him
for
a
fortnight
she
begged
me
as
dick
s
friend
and
her
own
to
save
him
and
i
undertook
to
do
so
i
climbed
to
her
room
to
assist
him
to
descend
by
the
rope
ladder
you
saw
because
he
was
wounded
and
could
not
climb
without
assistance
at
the
gates
i
had
the
curricle
waiting
in
which
i
had
driven
up
in
this
i
was
to
have
taken
him
on
board
a
ship
that
was
leaving
that
night
for
england
having
made
arrangements
with
her
captain
you
should
have
seen
had
you
reflected
that
as
i
told
the
court
had
i
been
coming
to
a
clandestine
meeting
i
should
hardly
have
driven
up
in
so
open
a
fashion
and
left
the
curricle
to
wait
for
me
at
the
gates
the
death
of
samoval
and
my
own
arrest
thwarted
our
plans
and
prevented
dick
s
escape
that
is
the
truth
now
that
you
have
it
i
hope
you
like
it
and
i
hope
that
you
thoroughly
relish
your
own
behaviour
in
the
there
was
a
fluttering
sigh
of
relief
from
miss
armytage
then
silence
followed
in
which
o
moy
stared
at
tremayne
emotion
after
emotion
sweeping
across
his
mobile
face
dick
butler
he
said
at
last
and
cried
out
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
ye
re
lying
you
have
cause
enough
to
hope
the
captain
was
faintly
scornful
if
it
were
true
una
would
not
have
kept
it
from
me
it
was
to
me
she
would
have
the
trouble
with
you
o
moy
is
that
jealousy
seems
to
have
robbed
you
of
the
power
of
coherent
thought
or
else
you
would
remember
that
you
were
the
last
man
to
whom
una
could
confide
dick
s
presence
here
i
warned
her
against
doing
so
i
told
her
of
the
promise
you
had
been
compelled
to
give
the
secretary
forjas
and
i
was
even
at
pains
to
justify
you
to
her
when
she
was
indignant
with
you
for
that
it
would
perhaps
be
better
he
concluded
if
you
were
to
send
for
it
s
what
i
intend
said
sir
terence
in
a
voice
that
made
a
threat
of
the
statement
he
strode
stiffly
across
the
room
and
pulled
open
the
door
there
was
no
need
to
go
farther
lady
o
moy
white
and
tearful
was
discovered
on
the
threshold
sir
terence
stood
aside
holding
the
door
for
her
his
face
very
grim
she
came
in
slowly
looking
from
one
to
another
with
her
troubled
glance
and
finally
accepting
the
chair
that
captain
tremayne
made
haste
to
offer
her
she
had
so
much
to
say
to
each
person
present
that
it
was
impossible
to
know
where
to
begin
it
remained
for
sir
terence
to
give
her
the
lead
she
needed
and
this
he
did
so
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
again
planted
before
it
like
a
sentry
he
looked
at
her
between
anger
and
suspicion
how
much
did
you
overhear
he
asked
her
all
that
you
said
about
dick
she
answered
without
hesitation
then
you
stood
listening
of
course
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
were
there
are
other
ways
of
ascertaining
that
without
stooping
to
keyholes
said
her
husband
i
didn
t
stoop
she
said
taking
him
literally
i
could
hear
what
was
said
without
that
especially
what
you
said
terence
you
will
raise
your
voice
so
on
the
slightest
and
the
provocation
in
this
instance
was
of
course
of
the
slightest
since
you
have
heard
captain
tremayne
s
story
of
course
you
ll
have
no
difficulty
in
confirming
if
you
still
can
doubt
o
moy
said
tremayne
it
must
be
because
you
wish
to
doubt
because
you
are
afraid
to
face
the
truth
now
that
it
has
been
placed
before
you
i
think
una
it
will
spare
a
deal
of
trouble
and
save
your
husband
from
a
great
many
expressions
that
he
may
afterwards
regret
if
you
go
and
fetch
dick
god
knows
terence
has
enough
to
overwhelm
him
at
the
suggestion
of
producing
dick
o
moy
s
anger
which
had
begun
to
simmer
again
was
stilled
he
looked
at
his
wife
almost
in
alarm
and
she
met
his
look
with
one
of
utter
blankness
i
can
t
she
said
plaintively
dick
s
gone
cried
tremayne
gone
said
o
moy
and
then
he
began
to
laugh
are
you
quite
sure
that
he
was
ever
here
but
she
was
a
little
bewildered
and
a
frown
puckered
her
perfect
brow
hasn
t
ned
told
you
then
oh
ned
has
told
me
ned
has
told
his
face
was
terrible
and
don
t
you
believe
him
don
t
you
believe
me
she
was
more
plaintive
than
ever
it
was
almost
as
if
she
called
heaven
to
witness
what
manner
of
husband
she
was
forced
to
endure
then
you
had
better
call
mullins
and
ask
him
he
saw
dick
and
no
doubt
said
miss

mercilessly
sir
terence
will
believe
his
butler
where
he
can
believe
neither
his
wife
nor
his
he
looked
at
her
in
a
sort
of
amazement
do
you
believe
them
sylvia
he
cried
i
hope
i
am
not
a
fool
said
she
impatiently
meaning
he
began
but
broke
off
how
long
do
you
say
it
is
since
dick
left
the
house
ten
minutes
at
most
replied
her
ladyship
he
turned
and
pulled
the
door
open
again
mullins
he
called
mullins
what
a
man
to
live
with
sighed
her
ladyship
appealing
to
miss
armytage
what
a
man
and
she
applied
a
vinaigrette
delicately
to
her
nostrils
tremayne
smiled
and
sauntered
to
the
window
and
then
at
last
came
mullins
has
any
one
left
the
house
within
the
last
ten
minutes
mullins
asked
sir
terence
mullins
looked
ill
at
ease
sure
sir
you
ll
not
be
after
will
you
answer
my
question
man
roared
sir
terence
sure
then
there
s
nobody
left
the
house
at
all
but
butler
how
long
had
he
been
here
asked
o
moy
after
a
brief
pause
tis
what
i
can
t
tell
ye
sir
i
never
set
eyes
on
him
until
i
saw
him
coming
downstairs
from
her
ladyship
s
room
as
it
might
you
can
go
i
hope
sir
you
can
and
sir
terence
slammed
the
door
upon
the
amazed
servant
who
realised
that
some
unhappy
mystery
was
perturbing
the
adjutant
s
household
sir
terence
stood
facing
them
again
he
was
a
changed
man
the
fire
had
all
gone
out
of
him
his
head
was
bowed
and
his
face
looked
haggard
and
suddenly
old
his
lip
curled
into
a
sneer
pantaloon
in
the
comedy
he
said
remembering
in
that
moment
the
bitter
gibe
that
had
cost
samoval
his
life
what
did
you
say
her
ladyship
asked
him
i
pronounced
my
own
name
he
answered
lugubriously
it
didn
t
sound
like
it
it
s
the
name
i
ought
to
bear
he
said
and
i
killed
that
liar
for
it
the
only
truth
he
he
came
forward
to
the
table
the
full
sense
of
his
position
suddenly
overwhelmed
him
as
tremayne
had
said
it
would
a
groan
broke
from
him
and
he
collapsed
into
a
chair
a
stricken
broken
man
chapter
xx
the
resignation
at
once
as
he
sat
there
his
elbows
on
the
table
his
head
in
his
hands
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
those
three
against
each
of
whom
he
had
sinned
under
the
spell
of
the
jealousy
that
had
blinded
him
and
led
him
by
the
nose
his
wife
put
an
arm
about
his
neck
in
mute
comfort
of
a
grief
of
which
she
only
understood
the
half
for
of
the
heavier
and
more
desperate
part
of
his
guilt
she
was
still
in
ignorance
sylvia
spoke
to
him
kindly
words
of
encouragement
where
no
encouragement
could
avail
but
what
moved
him
most
was
the
touch
of
tremayne
s
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
tremayne
s
voice
bidding
him
brace
himself
to
face
the
situation
and
count
upon
them
to
stand
by
him
to
the
end
he
looked
up
at
his
friend
and
secretary
in
an
amazement
that
overcame
his
shame
you
can
forgive
me
ned
ned
looked
across
at
sylvia
armytage
you
have
been
the
means
of
bringing
me
to
such
happiness
as
i
should
never
have
reached
without
these
happenings
he
said
what
resentment
can
i
bear
you
o
moy
besides
i
understand
and
who
understands
can
never
do
anything
but
forgive
i
realise
how
sorely
you
have
been
tried
no
evidence
more
conclusive
that
you
were
being
wronged
could
have
been
placed
before
but
the
said
o
moy
in
horror
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
oh
my
god
i
am
dishonoured
i
i
he
rose
shaking
off
the
arm
of
his
wife
and
the
hand
of
the
friend
he
had
wronged
so
terribly
he
broke
away
from
them
and
strode
to
the
window
his
face
set
and
white
i
think
i
was
mad
he
said
i
know
i
was
mad
but
to
have
done
what
i
did
he
shuddered
in
very
horror
of
himself
now
that
he
was
bereft
of
the
support
of
that
evil
jealousy
that
had
fortified
him
against
conscience
itself
and
the
very
voice
of
honour
lady
o
moy
turned
to
them
pleading
for
explanation
what
does
he
mean
what
has
he
done
himself
he
answered
her
i
killed
samoval
it
was
i
who
fought
that
duel
and
then
believing
what
i
did
i
fastened
the
guilt
upon
ned
and
went
the
lengths
of
perjury
in
my
blind
effort
to
avenge
myself
that
is
what
i
have
done
tell
me
one
of
you
of
your
charity
what
is
there
left
for
me
to
do
oh
it
was
an
outcry
of
horror
and
indignation
from
una
instantly
repressed
by
the
tightening
grip
of
sylvia
s
hand
upon
her
arm
miss
armytage
saw
and
understood
and
sorrowed
for
sir
terence
she
must
restrain
his
wife
from
adding
to
his
present
anguish
yet
how
could
you
terence
oh
how
could
you
cried
her
ladyship
and
so
gave
way
to
tears
easier
than
words
to
express
such
natures
because
i
loved
you
i
suppose
he
answered
on
a
note
of
bitter
that
was
the
justification
i
should
have
given
had
i
been
asked
that
was
the
justification
i
accounted
but
then
she
cried
a
new
horror
breaking
on
her
mind
if
this
is
discovered
terence
what
will
become
of
you
he
turned
and
came
slowly
back
until
he
stood
beside
her
facing
now
the
inevitable
he
recovered
some
of
his
calm
it
must
be
discovered
he
said
quietly
for
the
sake
of
everybody
concerned
it
must
oh
no
no
she
sprang
up
and
clutched
his
arm
in
terror
they
may
fail
to
discover
the
they
must
not
my
dear
he
answered
her
stroking
the
fair
head
that
lay
against
his
breast
they
must
not
fail
i
must
see
to
you
you
her
eyes
dilated
as
she
looked
at
him
she
caught
her
breath
on
a
gasping
sob
ah
no
terence
she
cried
wildly
you
must
not
you
must
not
you
must
say
nothing
for
my
sake
terence
if
you
love
me
oh
for
my
sake
terence
for
honour
s
sake
i
must
he
answered
her
and
for
the
sake
of
sylvia
and
of
tremayne
whom
i
have
wronged
and
not
for
my
sake
terence
sylvia
interrupted
him
he
looked
at
her
and
then
at
tremayne
and
you
ned
what
do
you
say
he
asked
ned
could
not
wish
began
her
ladyship
please
let
him
speak
for
himself
my
dear
her
husband
interrupted
her
what
can
i
say
cried
tremayne
with
a
gesture
that
was
almost
of
anger
how
can
i
advise
i
scarcely
know
you
realise
what
you
must
face
if
you
confess
fully
and
the
only
part
of
it
i
shrink
from
is
the
shame
and
scorn
i
have
deserved
yet
it
is
inevitable
you
agree
ned
i
am
not
sure
none
who
understands
as
i
understand
can
feel
anything
but
regret
oh
i
don
t
know
the
evidence
of
what
you
suspected
was
overwhelming
and
it
betrayed
you
into
this
mistake
the
punishment
you
would
have
to
face
is
surely
too
heavy
and
you
have
suffered
far
more
already
than
you
can
ever
be
called
upon
to
suffer
again
no
matter
what
is
done
to
you
oh
i
don
t
know
the
problem
is
too
deep
for
me
there
is
una
to
be
considered
too
you
owe
a
duty
to
her
and
if
you
keep
silent
it
may
be
best
for
all
you
can
depend
upon
us
to
stand
by
you
in
indeed
indeed
said
sylvia
he
looked
at
them
and
smiled
very
tenderly
never
was
a
man
blessed
with
nobler
friends
who
deserved
so
little
of
them
he
said
slowly
you
heap
coals
of
fire
upon
my
head
you
shame
me
through
and
through
but
have
you
considered
ned
that
all
may
not
depend
upon
my
silence
what
if
the
investigating
now
were
to
come
upon
the
real
facts
it
is
impossible
that
sufficient
should
be
discovered
to
convict
how
can
you
be
sure
of
that
and
if
it
were
possible
if
it
came
to
pass
what
then
would
be
my
position
you
see
ned
i
must
accept
the
punishment
i
have
incurred
lest
a
worse
overtake
me
to
put
it
at
its
lowest
i
must
voluntarily
go
forward
and
denounce
myself
before
another
denounces
me
it
is
the
only
way
to
save
some
rag
of
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
mullins
came
to
announce
that
lord
wellington
was
asking
to
see
sir
terence
he
is
waiting
in
the
study
sir
tell
his
lordship
i
will
be
with
him
at
mullins
departed
and
sir
terence
prepared
to
follow
gently
he
disengaged
himself
from
the
arms
her
ladyship
now
flung
about
him
courage
my
dear
he
said
wellington
may
show
me
more
mercy
than
i
you
are
going
to
tell
him
she
questioned
brokenly
of
course
sweetheart
what
else
can
i
do
and
since
you
and
tremayne
find
it
in
your
hearts
to
forgive
me
nothing
else
matters
very
he
kissed
her
tenderly
and
put
her
from
him
he
looked
at
sylvia
standing
beside
her
and
at
tremayne
beyond
the
table
comfort
her
he
implored
them
and
turning
went
out
quickly
awaiting
him
in
the
study
he
found
not
only
lord
wellington
but
colonel
grant
and
by
the
cold
gravity
of
both
their
faces
he
had
an
inspiration
that
in
some
mysterious
way
the
whole
hideous
truth
was
already
known
to
them
the
slight
figure
of
his
lordship
in
its
grey
frock
was
stiff
and
erect
his
booted
leg
firmly
planted
his
hands
behind
him
clutching
his
and
cocked
hat
his
face
was
set
and
his
voice
as
he
greeted
o
moy
sharp
and
staccato
ah
o
moy
there
are
one
or
two
matters
to
be
discussed
before
i
leave
i
had
written
to
you
sir
replied
o
moy
perhaps
you
will
first
read
my
and
he
went
to
fetch
it
from
the
where
he
had
left
it
when
completed
an
hour
earlier
his
lordship
took
the
letter
in
silence
and
after
one
piercing
glance
at
o
moy
broke
the
seal
in
the
background
near
the
window
the
tall
figure
of
colquhoun
grant
stood
stiffly
erect
his
hawk
face
inscrutable
ah
your
resignation
o
moy
but
you
give
no
again
his
keen
glance
stabbed
into
the
adjutant
s
face
why
this
he
asked
sharply
because
said
sir
terence
i
prefer
to
tender
it
before
it
is
asked
of
he
was
very
white
yet
by
an
effort
those
deep
blue
eyes
of
his
met
the
terrible
gaze
of
his
chief
without
flinching
perhaps
you
ll
explain
said
his
lordship
coldly
in
the
first
place
said
o
moy
it
was
myself
killed
samoval
and
since
your
lordship
was
a
witness
of
what
followed
you
will
realise
that
that
was
the
least
part
of
my
the
great
soldier
jerked
his
head
sharply
backward
tilting
forward
his
chin
so
he
said
ha
i
beg
your
pardon
grant
for
having
disbelieved
then
turning
to
o
moy
again
well
he
demanded
his
voice
hard
have
you
nothing
to
add
nothing
that
can
matter
said
o
moy
with
a
shrug
and
they
stood
facing
each
other
in
silence
for
a
long
moment
at
last
when
wellington
spoke
his
voice
had
assumed
a
gentler
note
o
moy
he
said
i
have
known
you
these
fifteen
years
and
we
have
been
friends
once
you
carried
your
friendship
appreciation
and
understanding
of
me
so
far
as
nearly
to
ruin
yourself
on
my
behalf
you
ll
not
have
forgotten
the
affair
of
sir
harry
burrard
in
all
these
years
i
have
known
you
for
a
man
of
shining
honour
an
honest
upright
gentleman
whom
i
would
have
trusted
when
i
should
have
distrusted
every
other
living
man
yet
you
stand
there
and
confess
to
me
the
basest
the
most
dishonest
villainy
that
i
have
ever
known
a
british
officer
to
commit
and
you
tell
me
that
you
have
no
explanation
to
offer
for
your
conduct
either
i
have
never
known
you
o
moy
or
i
do
not
know
you
now
which
is
it
o
moy
raised
his
arms
only
to
let
them
fall
heavily
to
his
sides
again
what
explanation
can
there
be
he
asked
how
can
a
man
who
has
been
as
i
hope
i
have
a
man
of
honour
in
the
past
explain
such
an
act
of
madness
it
arose
out
of
your
order
against
duelling
he
went
on
samoval
offended
me
mortally
he
said
such
things
to
me
of
my
wife
s
honour
that
no
man
could
suffer
and
i
least
of
any
man
my
temper
betrayed
me
i
consented
to
a
clandestine
meeting
without
seconds
it
took
place
here
and
i
killed
him
and
then
i
had
as
i
imagined
quite
wrongly
as
i
know
now
overwhelming
evidence
that
what
he
had
told
me
was
true
and
i
went
briefly
he
told
the
story
of
tremayne
s
descent
from
lady
o
moy
s
balcony
and
the
rest
i
scarcely
know
he
resumed
what
it
was
i
hoped
to
accomplish
in
the
end
i
do
not
know
for
i
never
stopped
to
consider
whether
i
should
have
allowed
captain
tremayne
to
have
been
shot
if
it
had
come
to
that
all
that
i
was
concerned
to
do
was
to
submit
him
to
the
ordeal
which
i
conceived
he
must
undergo
when
he
saw
himself
confronted
with
the
choice
of
keeping
silence
and
submitting
to
his
fate
or
saving
himself
by
an
avowal
that
could
scarcely
be
less
bitter
than
death
you
fool
o
damned
infernal
fool
his
lordship
swore
at
him
grant
overheard
more
than
you
imagined
that
night
outside
the
gates
his
conclusions
ran
the
truth
very
close
indeed
but
i
could
not
believe
him
could
not
believe
this
of
of
course
not
said
o
moy
gloomily
i
can
t
believe
it
of
when
miss
armytage
intervened
to
afford
tremayne
an
alibi
i
believed
her
in
view
of
what
grant
had
told
me
i
concluded
that
hers
was
the
window
from
which
tremayne
had
climbed
down
because
of
what
i
knew
i
was
there
to
see
that
the
case
did
not
go
to
extremes
against
tremayne
if
necessary
grant
must
have
given
full
evidence
of
all
he
knew
and
there
and
then
left
you
to
your
fate
miss
armytage
saved
us
from
that
and
left
me
convinced
but
still
not
understanding
your
own
attitude
and
now
comes
richard
butler
to
surrender
to
me
and
cast
himself
upon
my
mercy
with
another
tale
which
completely
gives
the
lie
to
miss
armytage
s
but
confirms
your
richard
butler
cried
o
moy
he
has
surrendered
to
you
sir
terence
turned
aside
with
a
weary
shrug
a
little
laugh
that
was
more
a
sob
broke
from
him
poor
una
he
muttered
the
tangle
is
a
shocking
one
lies
lies
everywhere
and
in
the
places
where
they
were
least
to
be
wellington
s
anger
flashed
out
do
you
realise
what
awaits
you
as
a
result
of
all
this
damned
insanity
i
do
sir
that
is
why
i
place
my
resignation
in
your
hands
the
disregard
of
a
general
order
punishable
in
any
officer
is
beyond
pardon
in
your
but
that
is
the
least
of
it
you
sure
don
t
i
know
i
assure
you
that
i
realise
it
and
you
are
prepared
to
face
it
wellington
was
almost
savage
in
an
anger
proceeding
from
the
conflict
that
went
on
within
him
there
was
his
duty
as
and
there
was
his
friendship
for
o
moy
and
his
memory
of
the
past
in
which
o
moy
s
loyalty
had
almost
been
the
ruin
of
him
what
choice
have
i
his
lordship
turned
away
and
strode
the
length
of
the
room
his
head
bent
his
lips
twitching
suddenly
he
stopped
and
faced
the
silent
intelligence
officer
what
is
to
be
done
grant
that
is
a
matter
for
your
lordship
but
if
i
might
venture
venture
and
be
damned
snapped
wellington
the
signal
service
rendered
the
cause
of
the
allies
by
the
death
of
samoval
might
perhaps
be
permitted
to
weigh
against
the
offence
committed
by
o
how
could
it
snapped
his
lordship
you
don
t
know
o
moy
that
upon
samoval
s
body
were
found
certain
documents
intended
for
massena
had
they
reached
him
or
had
samoval
carried
out
the
full
intentions
that
dictated
his
quarrel
with
you
and
no
doubt
sent
him
here
depending
upon
his
swordsmanship
to
kill
you
all
my
plans
for
the
undoing
of
the
french
would
have
been
ruined
ay
you
may
stare
that
is
another
matter
in
which
you
have
lacked
discretion
you
may
be
a
fine
engineer
o
moy
but
i
don
t
think
i
could
have
found
a
less
judicious
if
i
had
raked
the
ranks
of
the
army
on
purpose
to
find
an
idiot
samoval
was
a
spy
the
cleverest
spy
that
we
have
ever
had
to
deal
with
only
his
death
revealed
how
dangerous
he
was
for
killing
him
when
you
did
you
deserve
the
thanks
of
his
majesty
s
government
as
grant
suggests
but
before
you
can
receive
those
you
will
have
to
stand
a
for
the
manner
in
which
you
killed
him
and
you
will
probably
be
shot
i
can
t
help
you
i
hope
you
don
t
expect
it
of
the
thought
had
not
so
much
as
occurred
to
me
yet
what
you
tell
me
sir
lifts
something
of
the
load
from
my
does
it
well
it
lifts
no
load
from
mine
was
the
angry
retort
he
stood
considering
then
with
an
impatient
gesture
he
seemed
to
dismiss
his
thoughts
i
can
do
nothing
he
said
nothing
without
being
false
to
my
duty
and
becoming
as
bad
as
you
have
been
o
moy
and
without
any
of
the
sentimental
justification
that
existed
in
your
case
i
can
t
allow
the
matter
to
be
dropped
stifled
i
have
never
been
guilty
of
such
a
thing
and
i
refuse
to
become
guilty
of
it
now
i
refuse
do
you
understand
o
moy
you
have
acted
and
you
must
take
the
consequences
and
be
damned
to
faith
i
ve
never
asked
you
to
help
me
sir
sir
terence
protested
and
you
don
t
intend
to
i
suppose
i
do
i
am
glad
of
he
was
in
one
of
those
rages
which
were
as
terrible
as
they
were
rare
with
him
i
wouldn
t
have
you
suppose
that
i
make
laws
for
the
sake
of
rescuing
people
from
the
consequences
of
disobeying
them
here
is
this
of
yours
this
fellow
butler
who
has
made
enough
mischief
in
the
country
to
imperil
our
relations
with
our
allies
and
i
am
half
pledged
to
condone
his
adventure
at
tavora
there
s
nothing
for
it
o
moy
as
your
friend
i
am
infernally
angry
with
you
for
placing
yourself
in
this
position
as
your
commanding
officer
i
can
only
order
you
under
arrest
and
convene
a
to
deal
with
sir
terence
bowed
his
head
he
was
a
little
surprised
by
all
this
heat
i
never
expected
anything
else
he
said
and
it
s
altogether
at
a
loss
i
am
to
understand
why
your
lordship
should
be
vexing
yourself
in
this
because
i
ve
a
friendship
for
you
o
moy
because
i
remember
that
you
ve
been
a
loyal
friend
to
me
and
because
i
must
forget
all
this
and
remember
only
that
my
duty
is
absolutely
rigid
and
inflexible
if
i
condoned
your
offence
if
i
suppressed
inquiry
i
should
be
in
duty
and
honour
bound
to
offer
my
own
resignation
to
his
majesty
s
government
and
i
have
to
think
of
other
things
besides
my
personal
feelings
when
at
any
moment
now
the
french
may
be
over
the
agueda
and
into
sir
terence
s
face
flushed
and
his
glance
brightened
from
my
heart
i
thank
you
that
you
can
even
think
of
such
things
at
such
a
time
and
after
what
i
have
oh
as
to
what
you
have
done
i
understand
that
you
are
a
fool
o
moy
there
s
no
more
to
be
said
you
are
to
consider
yourself
under
arrest
i
must
do
it
if
you
were
my
own
brother
which
thank
god
you
re
not
come
grant
o
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
him
sir
terence
hesitated
staring
it
s
the
hand
of
your
friend
arthur
wellesley
i
m
offering
you
not
the
hand
of
your
commanding
officer
said
his
lordship
savagely
sir
terence
took
it
and
wrung
it
in
silence
perhaps
more
deeply
moved
than
he
had
yet
been
by
anything
that
had
happened
to
him
that
morning
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
mullins
opened
it
to
admit
the
adjutant
s
orderly
who
came
stiffly
to
attention
major
carruthers
s
compliments
sir
he
said
to
o
moy
and
his
excellency
the
secretary
of
the
council
of
regency
wishes
to
see
you
very
there
was
a
pause
o
moy
shrugged
and
spread
his
hands
this
message
was
for
the
and
he
no
longer
filled
the
office
pray
tell
major
carruthers
that
i
he
was
beginning
when
lord
wellington
intervened
desire
his
excellency
to
step
across
here
i
will
see
him
chapter
xxi
sanctuary
i
will
withdraw
sir
said
terence
but
wellington
detained
him
since
dom
miguel
asked
for
you
you
had
better
remain
it
is
the
dom
miguel
desires
to
see
and
i
am
no
still
the
matter
may
concern
you
i
have
a
notion
that
it
may
be
concerned
with
the
death
of
count
samoval
since
i
have
acquainted
the
council
of
regency
with
the
treason
practised
by
the
count
you
had
better
gloomy
and
downcast
sir
terence
remained
as
he
was
bidden
the
sleek
and
supple
secretary
of
state
was
ushered
in
he
came
forward
quickly
clicked
his
heels
together
and
bowed
to
the
three
men
present
sirs
your
obedient
servant
he
announced
himself
with
a
courtliness
almost
out
of
fashion
speaking
in
his
extraordinarily
fluent
english
his
sallow
countenance
was
extremely
grave
he
seemed
even
a
little
ill
at
ease
i
am
fortunate
to
find
you
here
my
lord
the
matter
upon
which
i
seek
your
is
of
considerable
gravity
so
much
that
of
himself
he
might
be
unable
to
resolve
it
i
feared
you
might
already
have
departed
for
the
since
you
suggest
that
my
presence
may
be
of
service
to
you
i
am
happy
that
circumstances
should
have
delayed
my
departure
was
his
lordship
s
courteous
answer
a
chair
dom
dom
miguel
forjas
accepted
the
proffered
chair
whilst
wellington
seated
himself
at
sir
terence
s
desk
sir
terence
himself
remained
standing
with
his
shoulders
to
the
overmantel
whence
he
faced
them
both
as
well
as
grant
who
according
to
his
habit
remained
in
the
background
by
the
window
i
have
sought
you
began
dom
miguel
stroking
his
square
chin
on
a
matter
concerned
with
the
late
count
samoval
immediately
upon
hearing
that
the
pronounced
the
acquittal
of
captain
his
lordship
frowned
and
his
eagle
glance
fastened
upon
the
secretary
s
face
i
trust
sir
you
have
not
come
to
question
the
finding
of
the
oh
on
the
contrary
on
the
contrary
dom
miguel
was
emphatic
i
represent
not
only
the
council
but
the
samoval
family
as
well
both
realise
that
it
is
perhaps
fortunate
for
all
concerned
that
in
arresting
captain
tremayne
the
military
authorities
arrested
the
wrong
man
and
both
have
reason
to
dread
the
arrest
of
the
right
he
paused
and
the
frown
deepened
between
wellington
s
brows
i
am
afraid
he
said
slowly
that
i
do
not
quite
perceive
their
concern
in
this
but
is
it
not
clear
cried
dom
miguel
if
it
were
i
should
perceive
it
said
his
lordship
dryly
ah
but
let
me
explain
then
a
further
investigation
of
the
manner
in
which
count
samoval
met
his
death
can
hardly
fail
to
bring
to
light
the
deplorable
practices
in
which
he
was
engaged
for
no
doubt
colonel
grant
here
would
consider
it
his
duty
in
the
interests
of
justice
to
place
before
the
court
the
documents
found
upon
the
count
s
dead
body
if
i
may
permit
myself
an
observation
he
continued
looking
round
at
colonel
grant
it
is
that
i
do
not
quite
understand
how
this
has
not
already
there
was
a
pause
in
which
grant
looked
at
wellington
as
if
for
direction
but
his
lordship
himself
assumed
the
burden
of
the
answer
it
was
not
considered
expedient
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so
at
present
he
said
and
the
circumstances
did
not
place
us
under
the
necessity
of
divulging
the
there
my
lord
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
you
acted
with
a
delicacy
and
wisdom
which
the
circumstances
may
not
again
permit
indeed
any
further
investigation
must
almost
inevitably
bring
these
matters
to
light
and
the
effect
of
such
revelation
would
be
deplorable
to
whom
asked
his
lordship
to
the
count
s
family
and
to
the
council
of
i
can
sympathise
with
the
count
s
family
but
not
with
the
surely
my
lord
the
council
as
a
body
deserves
your
sympathy
in
that
it
is
in
danger
of
being
utterly
discredited
by
the
treason
of
one
or
two
of
its
wellington
manifested
impatience
the
council
has
been
warned
time
and
again
i
am
weary
of
warning
and
even
of
threatening
the
council
with
the
consequences
of
resisting
my
policy
i
think
that
exposure
is
not
only
what
it
deserves
but
the
surest
means
of
providing
a
healthier
government
in
the
future
i
am
weary
of
picking
my
way
through
the
web
of
intrigue
with
which
the
council
entangles
my
movements
and
my
dispositions
public
sympathy
has
enabled
it
to
hamper
me
in
this
fashion
that
sympathy
will
be
lost
to
it
by
the
disclosures
which
you
my
lord
i
must
confess
that
there
is
much
reason
in
what
you
he
was
smoothly
conciliatory
i
understand
your
exasperation
but
may
i
be
permitted
to
assure
you
that
it
is
not
the
council
as
a
body
that
has
withstood
you
but
certain
members
one
or
two
friends
of
principal
souza
in
whose
interests
the
unfortunate
and
misguided
count
samoval
was
acting
your
lordship
will
perceive
that
the
moment
is
not
one
in
which
to
stir
up
public
indignation
against
the
portuguese
government
once
the
passions
of
the
mob
are
inflamed
who
can
say
to
what
lengths
they
may
not
go
who
can
say
what
disastrous
consequences
may
not
follow
it
is
desirable
to
apply
the
cautery
but
not
to
burn
up
the
whole
lord
wellington
considered
a
moment
fingering
an
ivory
he
was
partly
convinced
when
i
last
suggested
the
cautery
to
use
your
own
very
apt
figure
the
council
did
not
keep
faith
with
my
lord
it
did
not
sir
it
removed
antonio
de
souza
but
it
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
go
further
and
remove
his
friends
at
the
same
time
they
remained
to
carry
on
his
subversive
treacherous
intrigues
what
guarantees
have
i
that
the
council
will
behave
better
on
this
occasion
you
have
our
solemn
assurances
my
lord
that
all
those
members
suspected
of
complicity
in
this
business
or
of
attachment
to
the
souza
faction
shall
be
compelled
to
resign
and
you
may
depend
upon
the
reconstituted
council
loyally
to
support
your
you
give
me
assurances
sir
and
i
ask
for
your
lordship
is
in
possession
of
the
documents
found
upon
count
samoval
the
council
knows
this
and
this
knowledge
will
compel
it
to
guard
against
further
intrigues
on
the
part
of
any
of
its
members
which
might
naturally
exasperate
you
into
publishing
those
documents
is
not
that
some
guarantee
his
lordship
considered
and
nodded
slowly
i
admit
that
it
is
yet
i
do
not
see
how
this
publicity
is
to
be
avoided
in
the
course
of
the
further
investigations
into
the
manner
in
which
count
samoval
came
by
his
my
lord
that
is
the
pivot
of
the
whole
matter
all
further
investigation
must
be
sir
terence
trembled
and
his
eyes
turned
in
eager
anxiety
upon
the
inscrutable
stern
face
of
lord
wellington
must
cried
his
lordship
sharply
what
else
my
lord
in
all
our
interests
exclaimed
the
secretary
and
he
rose
in
his
agitation
and
what
of
british
justice
sir
demanded
his
lordship
in
a
forbidding
tone
british
justice
has
reason
to
consider
itself
satisfied
british
justice
may
assume
that
count
samoval
met
his
death
in
the
pursuit
of
his
treachery
he
was
a
spy
caught
in
the
act
and
there
and
then
destroyed
a
very
proper
fate
had
he
been
taken
british
justice
would
have
demanded
no
less
it
has
been
anticipated
can
not
british
justice
for
the
sake
of
british
interests
as
well
as
portuguese
interests
be
content
to
leave
the
matter
there
an
argument
of
expediency
eh
said
wellington
why
not
my
lord
does
not
expediency
govern
politicians
i
am
not
a
but
a
wise
soldier
my
lord
does
not
lose
sight
of
the
political
consequences
of
his
and
he
sat
down
again
your
excellency
may
be
right
said
his
lordship
let
us
be
quite
clear
then
you
suggest
speaking
in
the
name
of
the
council
of
regency
that
i
should
suppress
all
further
investigations
into
the
manner
in
which
count
samoval
met
his
death
so
as
to
save
his
family
the
shame
and
the
council
of
regency
the
discredit
which
must
overtake
one
and
the
other
if
the
facts
are
disclosed
as
disclosed
they
would
be
that
samoval
was
a
traitor
and
a
spy
in
the
pay
of
the
french
that
is
what
you
ask
me
to
do
in
return
your
council
undertakes
that
there
shall
be
no
further
opposition
to
my
plans
for
the
military
defence
of
portugal
and
that
all
my
measures
however
harsh
and
however
heavily
they
may
weigh
upon
the
landowners
shall
be
punctually
and
faithfully
carried
out
that
is
your
excellency
s
proposal
is
it
not
not
so
much
my
proposal
my
lord
as
my
most
earnest
intercession
we
desire
to
spare
the
innocent
the
consequences
of
the
sins
of
a
man
who
is
dead
and
well
he
turned
to
o
moy
standing
there
tense
and
anxious
it
was
not
for
dom
miguel
to
know
that
it
was
the
adjutant
s
fate
that
was
being
decided
sir
terence
he
cried
you
have
been
here
for
a
year
and
all
matters
connected
with
the
council
have
been
treated
through
you
you
can
not
fail
to
see
the
wisdom
of
my
his
lordship
s
eyes
flashed
round
upon
o
moy
ah
yes
he
said
what
is
your
feeling
in
this
matter
o
moy
he
inquired
his
tone
and
manner
void
of
all
expression
sir
terence
faltered
then
stiffened
i
the
matter
is
one
that
only
your
lordship
can
decide
i
have
no
wish
to
influence
your
i
see
ha
and
you
grant
no
doubt
you
agree
with
dom
miguel
most
emphatically
upon
every
count
sir
replied
the
intelligence
officer
without
hesitation
i
think
dom
miguel
offers
an
excellent
bargain
and
as
he
says
we
hold
a
guarantee
of
its
the
bargain
might
be
improved
said
wellington
slowly
if
your
lordship
will
tell
me
how
the
council
i
am
sure
will
be
ready
to
do
all
that
lies
in
its
power
to
satisfy
wellington
shifted
his
chair
round
a
little
and
crossed
his
legs
he
brought
his
together
and
over
the
top
of
them
his
eyes
considered
the
secretary
of
state
your
excellency
has
spoken
of
expediency
political
expediency
sometimes
political
expediency
can
overreach
itself
and
perpetrate
the
most
grave
injustices
individuals
at
times
are
unnecessarily
called
upon
to
suffer
in
the
interests
of
a
cause
your
excellency
will
remember
a
certain
affair
at
tavora
some
two
months
ago
the
invasion
of
a
convent
by
a
british
officer
with
rather
disastrous
consequences
and
the
loss
of
some
i
remember
it
perfectly
my
lord
i
had
the
honour
of
entertaining
sir
terence
upon
that
subject
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit
quite
so
said
his
lordship
and
on
the
grounds
of
political
expediency
you
made
a
bargain
then
with
sir
terence
i
understand
a
bargain
which
entailed
the
perpetration
of
an
i
am
not
aware
of
it
my
then
let
me
refresh
your
excellency
s
memory
upon
the
facts
to
appease
the
council
of
regency
or
rather
to
enable
me
to
have
my
way
with
the
council
and
remove
the
principal
souza
you
stipulated
for
the
assurance
so
that
you
might
lay
it
before
your
council
that
the
offending
officer
should
be
shot
when
i
could
not
help
myself
in
the
matter
and
a
moment
sir
that
is
not
the
way
of
british
justice
and
sir
terence
was
wrong
to
have
permitted
himself
to
consent
though
i
profoundly
appreciate
the
loyalty
to
me
the
earnest
desire
to
assist
me
which
led
him
into
an
act
the
cost
of
which
to
himself
your
excellency
can
hardly
appreciate
but
the
wrong
lay
in
that
by
virtue
of
this
bargain
a
british
officer
was
prejudged
he
was
to
be
made
a
scapegoat
he
was
to
be
sent
to
his
death
when
taken
as
a
to
the
people
demanded
by
the
council
of
regency
since
all
this
happened
i
have
had
the
facts
of
the
case
placed
before
me
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
tell
you
sir
that
the
officer
in
question
has
been
in
my
hands
for
the
past
hour
that
i
have
closely
questioned
him
and
that
i
am
satisfied
that
whilst
he
has
been
guilty
of
conduct
which
might
compel
me
to
deprive
him
of
his
majesty
s
commission
and
dismiss
him
from
the
army
yet
that
conduct
is
not
such
as
to
merit
death
he
has
chiefly
sinned
in
folly
and
want
of
judgment
i
reprove
it
in
the
sternest
terms
and
i
deplore
the
consequences
it
had
but
for
those
consequences
the
nuns
of
tavora
are
almost
as
much
to
blame
as
he
is
himself
his
invasion
of
their
convent
was
a
pure
error
committed
in
the
belief
that
it
was
a
monastery
and
as
a
result
of
the
porter
s
foolish
conduct
now
sir
terence
s
word
given
in
response
to
your
absolute
demands
has
committed
us
to
an
unjust
course
which
i
have
no
intention
of
following
i
will
stipulate
sir
that
your
council
in
addition
to
the
matters
undertaken
shall
relieve
us
of
all
obligation
in
this
matter
leaving
it
to
our
discretion
to
punish
butler
in
such
manner
as
we
may
consider
condign
in
return
your
excellency
i
will
undertake
that
there
shall
be
no
further
investigation
into
the
manner
in
which
count
samoval
came
by
his
death
and
consequently
no
disclosures
of
the
shameful
trade
in
which
he
was
engaged
if
your
excellency
will
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
taking
the
sense
of
your
council
upon
this
we
may
then
reach
a
the
grave
anxiety
of
dom
miguel
s
countenance
was
instantly
dispelled
in
his
relief
he
permitted
himself
a
smile
my
lord
there
is
not
the
need
to
take
the
sense
of
the
council
the
council
has
given
me
carte
blanche
to
obtain
your
consent
to
a
suppression
of
the
samoval
affair
and
without
hesitation
i
accept
the
further
condition
that
you
make
sir
terence
may
consider
himself
relieved
of
his
parole
in
the
matter
of
lieutenant
then
we
may
look
upon
the
matter
as
as
happily
concluded
my
dom
miguel
rose
to
make
his
valedictory
oration
it
remains
for
me
only
to
thank
your
lordship
in
the
name
of
the
council
for
the
courtesy
and
consideration
with
which
you
have
received
my
proposal
and
granted
our
petition
acquainted
as
i
am
with
the
crystalline
course
of
british
justice
knowing
as
i
do
how
it
seeks
ever
to
act
in
the
full
light
of
day
i
am
profoundly
sensible
of
the
cost
to
your
lordship
of
the
concession
you
make
to
the
feelings
of
the
samoval
family
and
the
portuguese
government
and
i
can
assure
you
that
they
will
be
accordingly
that
is
very
gracefully
said
dom
miguel
replied
his
lordship
rising
also
the
secretary
placed
a
hand
upon
his
heart
bowing
it
is
but
the
poor
expression
of
what
i
think
and
and
so
he
took
his
leave
of
them
escorted
by
colonel
grant
who
discreetly
volunteered
for
the
office
left
alone
with
wellington
sir
terence
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
supreme
relief
in
my
wife
s
name
sir
i
should
like
to
thank
you
but
she
shall
thank
you
herself
for
what
you
have
done
for
what
i
have
done
for
you
o
moy
wellington
s
slight
figure
stiffened
perceptibly
his
face
and
glance
were
cold
and
haughty
you
mistake
i
think
or
else
you
did
not
hear
what
i
have
done
i
have
done
solely
upon
grounds
of
political
expediency
i
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
and
it
was
not
to
favour
you
or
out
of
disregard
for
my
duty
as
you
seem
to
imagine
that
i
acted
as
i
o
moy
bowed
his
head
crushed
under
that
rebuff
he
clasped
and
unclasped
his
hands
a
moment
in
his
desperate
anguish
i
understand
he
muttered
in
a
broken
voice
i
i
beg
your
pardon
and
then
wellington
s
slender
firm
fingers
took
him
by
the
arm
but
i
am
glad
o
moy
that
i
had
no
choice
he
added
more
gently
as
a
man
i
suppose
i
may
be
glad
that
my
duty
as
placed
me
under
the
necessity
of
acting
as
i
have
sir
terence
clutched
the
hand
in
both
his
own
and
wrung
it
fiercely
obeying
an
overmastering
impulse
thank
you
he
cried
thank
you
for
that
tush
said
wellington
and
then
abruptly
what
are
you
going
to
do
o
moy
he
asked
do
said
o
moy
and
his
blue
eyes
looked
pleadingly
down
into
the
sternly
handsome
face
of
his
chief
i
am
in
your
hands
your
resignation
is
and
there
it
must
remain
o
moy
you
understand
of
course
sir
naturally
you
could
not
after
this
he
shrugged
and
broke
off
but
must
i
go
home
he
pleaded
what
else
and
by
god
sir
you
should
be
thankful
i
very
well
was
the
dull
answer
and
then
he
flared
out
faith
it
s
your
own
fault
for
giving
me
a
job
of
this
kind
you
knew
me
you
know
that
i
am
just
a
blunt
simple
soldier
that
my
place
is
at
the
head
of
a
regiment
not
at
the
head
of
an
administration
you
should
have
known
that
by
putting
me
out
of
my
proper
element
i
was
bound
to
get
into
trouble
sooner
or
perhaps
i
do
said
wellington
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
you
now
he
shrugged
and
strode
towards
the
window
you
had
better
go
home
o
moy
your
health
has
suffered
out
here
and
you
are
not
equal
to
the
heat
of
summer
that
is
now
increasing
that
is
the
reason
of
this
resignation
you
understand
i
shall
be
shamed
for
ever
said
o
moy
to
go
home
when
the
army
is
about
to
take
the
field
but
wellington
did
not
hear
him
or
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
he
had
reached
the
window
and
his
eye
was
caught
by
something
that
he
saw
in
the
courtyard
what
the
devil
s
this
now
he
rapped
out
that
is
one
of
sir
robert
craufurd
s
he
turned
and
went
quickly
to
the
door
he
opened
it
as
rapid
steps
approached
along
the
passage
accompanied
by
the
jingle
of
spurs
and
the
clatter
of
sabretache
and
trailing
sabre
colonel
grant
appeared
followed
by
a
young
officer
of
light
dragoons
who
was
powdered
from
head
to
foot
with
dust
the
youth
he
was
little
more
lurched
forward
wearily
yet
at
sight
of
wellington
he
braced
himself
to
attention
and
saluted
you
appear
to
have
ridden
hard
sir
the
commander
greeted
him
from
almeida
in
hours
my
lord
was
the
answer
with
these
from
sir
and
he
proffered
a
sealed
letter
what
is
your
name
wellington
inquired
as
he
took
the
package
hamilton
my
lord
was
the
answer
hamilton
of
the
sixteenth
to
sir
robert
wellington
nodded
that
was
great
horsemanship
hamilton
he
commended
him
and
a
faint
tinge
in
the
lad
s
haggard
cheeks
responded
to
that
rare
praise
the
urgency
was
great
my
lord
replied
hamilton
the
french
columns
are
in
movement
ney
and
junot
advanced
to
the
investment
of
ciudad
rodrigo
on
the
first
of
the
already
exclaimed
wellington
and
his
countenance
set
the
commander
general
herrasti
has
sent
an
urgent
appeal
to
sir
robert
for
and
sir
robert
the
question
came
on
a
sharp
note
of
apprehension
for
his
lordship
was
fully
aware
that
valour
was
the
better
part
of
sir
robert
craufurd
s
discretion
sir
robert
asks
for
orders
in
this
dispatch
and
refuses
to
stir
from
almeida
without
instructions
from
your
ah
it
was
a
sigh
of
relief
he
broke
the
seal
and
spread
the
dispatch
he
read
swiftly
very
well
was
all
he
said
when
he
had
reached
the
end
of
sir
robert
s
letter
i
shall
reply
to
this
in
person
and
at
once
you
will
be
in
need
of
rest
hamilton
you
had
best
take
a
day
to
recuperate
then
follow
me
to
almeida
sir
terence
no
doubt
will
see
to
your
immediate
with
pleasure
hamilton
replied
sir
terence
mechanically
for
his
own
concerns
weighed
upon
him
at
this
moment
more
heavily
than
the
french
advance
he
pulled
the
and
into
the
fatherly
hands
of
mullins
who
came
in
response
to
the
summons
the
young
officer
was
delivered
lord
wellington
took
up
his
hat
and
from
sir
terence
s
desk
i
shall
leave
for
the
frontier
at
once
he
announced
sir
robert
will
need
the
encouragement
of
my
presence
to
keep
him
within
the
prudent
bounds
i
have
imposed
and
i
do
not
know
how
long
ciudad
rodrigo
may
be
able
to
hold
out
at
any
moment
we
may
have
the
french
upon
the
agueda
and
the
invasion
may
begin
as
for
you
o
moy
this
has
changed
everything
the
french
and
the
needs
of
the
case
have
decided
for
the
present
no
change
is
possible
in
the
administration
here
in
lisbon
you
hold
the
threads
of
your
office
and
the
moment
is
not
one
in
which
to
appoint
another
adjutant
to
take
them
over
such
a
thing
might
be
fatal
to
the
success
of
the
british
arms
you
must
withdraw
this
and
he
proffered
the
document
sir
terence
recoiled
he
went
deathly
white
i
can
not
he
stammered
after
what
has
happened
i
lord
wellington
s
face
became
set
and
stern
his
eyes
blazed
upon
the
adjutant
o
moy
he
said
and
the
concentrated
anger
of
his
voice
was
terrifying
if
you
suggest
that
any
considerations
but
those
of
this
campaign
have
the
least
weight
with
me
in
what
i
now
do
you
insult
me
i
yield
to
no
man
in
my
sense
of
duty
and
i
allow
no
private
considerations
to
override
it
you
are
saved
from
going
home
in
disgrace
by
the
urgency
of
the
circumstances
as
i
have
told
you
by
that
and
by
nothing
else
be
thankful
then
and
in
loyally
remaining
at
your
post
efface
what
is
past
you
know
what
is
doing
at
torres
vedras
the
works
have
been
under
your
direction
from
the
commencement
see
that
they
are
vigorously
pushed
forward
and
that
the
lines
are
ready
to
receive
the
army
in
a
month
s
time
from
now
if
necessary
i
depend
upon
you
the
army
and
england
s
honour
depend
upon
you
i
bow
to
the
inevitable
and
so
shall
then
his
sternness
relaxed
so
much
as
your
commanding
officer
now
as
your
friend
and
he
held
out
his
hand
i
congratulate
you
upon
your
luck
after
this
morning
s
manifestations
of
it
it
should
pass
into
a
proverb
goodbye
o
moy
i
trust
you
and
i
shall
not
fail
you
gulped
o
moy
who
strong
man
that
he
was
found
himself
almost
on
the
verge
of
tears
he
clutched
the
extended
hand
i
shall
fix
my
headquarters
for
the
present
at
celorico
communicate
with
me
there
and
now
one
other
matter
the
council
of
regency
will
no
doubt
pester
you
with
representations
that
i
should
if
time
still
remains
advance
to
the
relief
of
ciudad
rodrigo
understand
that
is
no
part
of
my
plan
of
campaign
i
do
not
stir
across
the
frontier
of
portugal
here
let
the
french
come
and
find
me
and
i
shall
be
ready
to
receive
them
let
the
portuguese
government
have
no
illusions
on
that
point
and
stimulate
the
council
into
doing
all
possible
to
carry
out
the
destruction
of
mills
and
the
laying
waste
of
the
country
in
the
valley
of
the
mondego
and
wherever
else
i
have
required
oh
and
by
the
way
you
will
find
your
butler
in
the
yonder
awaiting
my
orders
provide
him
with
a
uniform
and
bid
him
rejoin
his
regiment
at
once
recommend
him
to
be
more
prudent
in
future
if
he
wishes
me
to
forget
his
escapade
at
tavora
and
in
future
o
moy
trust
your
wife
again
come
grant
i
have
instructions
for
you
too
but
you
must
take
them
as
we
and
thus
sir
terence
o
moy
found
sanctuary
at
the
altar
of
his
country
s
need
they
left
him
incredulously
to
marvel
at
the
luck
which
had
so
enlisted
circumstances
to
save
him
where
all
had
seemed
so
surely
lost
an
hour
ago
he
sent
a
servant
to
fetch
butler
the
prime
cause
of
all
this
pother
for
all
of
it
can
be
traced
to
butler
s
invasion
of
the
tavora
nunnery
and
with
him
went
to
bear
the
incredible
tidings
of
their
joint
absolution
to
the
three
who
waited
so
anxiously
in
the
postscriptum
the
particular
story
which
i
have
set
myself
to
relate
of
how
sir
terence
o
moy
was
taken
in
the
snare
of
his
own
jealousy
may
very
properly
be
concluded
here
but
the
greater
story
in
which
it
is
enshrined
and
with
which
it
is
interwoven
the
story
of
that
other
snare
in
which
my
lord
viscount
wellington
took
the
french
goes
on
this
story
is
the
history
of
the
war
in
the
peninsula
there
you
may
pursue
it
to
its
very
end
and
realise
the
iron
will
and
inflexibility
of
purpose
which
caused
men
ultimately
to
bestow
upon
him
who
guided
that
campaign
the
singularly
felicitous
and
fitting
sobriquet
of
the
iron
duke
ciudad
rodrigo
s
spanish
garrison
capitulated
on
the
of
july
of
that
year
and
a
wave
of
indignation
such
as
must
have
overwhelmed
any
but
a
man
of
almost
superhuman
mettle
swept
up
against
lord
wellington
for
having
stood
inactive
within
the
frontiers
of
portugal
and
never
stirred
a
hand
to
aid
the
spaniards
it
was
not
only
from
spain
that
bitter
invective
was
hurled
upon
him
british
journalism
poured
scorn
and
rage
upon
his
incompetence
french
journalism
held
his
pusillanimity
up
to
the
ridicule
of
the
world
his
own
officers
took
shame
in
their
general
and
expressed
it
parliament
demanded
to
know
how
long
british
honour
was
to
be
imperilled
by
such
a
man
and
finally
the
emperor
s
great
marshal
massena
gathering
his
hosts
to
overwhelm
the
kingdom
of
portugal
availed
himself
of
all
this
to
appeal
to
the
portuguese
nation
in
terms
which
the
facts
would
seem
to
corroborate
he
issued
his
proclamation
denouncing
the
british
for
the
disturbers
and
of
europe
warning
the
portuguese
that
they
were
the
cat
of
a
perfidious
nation
that
was
concerned
solely
with
the
serving
of
its
own
interests
and
the
gratification
of
its
predatory
ambitions
and
finally
summoning
them
to
receive
the
french
as
their
true
friends
and
saviours
the
nation
stirred
uneasily
so
far
no
good
had
come
to
them
of
their
alliance
with
the
british
indeed
wellington
s
policy
of
devastation
had
seemed
to
those
upon
whom
it
fell
more
horrible
than
any
french
invasion
could
have
been
but
wellington
held
the
reins
and
his
grip
never
relaxed
or
slackened
and
here
let
it
be
recorded
that
he
was
nobly
and
stoutly
served
in
lisbon
by
sir
terence
o
moy
pressure
upon
the
council
resulted
in
the
measures
demanded
being
carried
out
but
much
time
had
been
lost
through
the
intrigues
of
the
souza
faction
with
the
result
that
those
measures
although
prosecuted
now
more
vigorously
never
reached
the
full
extent
which
wellington
had
desired
treachery
too
stepped
in
to
shorten
the
time
still
further
almeida
garrisoned
by
portuguese
and
commanded
by
colonel
cox
and
a
british
staff
should
have
held
a
month
but
no
sooner
had
the
french
appeared
before
it
on
the
august
than
a
powder
magazine
traitorously
fired
exploded
and
breached
the
wall
rendering
the
place
untenable
to
wellington
this
was
perhaps
the
most
vexatious
of
all
things
in
that
vexatious
time
he
had
hoped
to
detain
massena
before
almeida
until
the
rains
should
have
set
in
when
the
french
would
have
found
themselves
struggling
through
a
sodden
country
through
bridgeless
floods
and
a
land
bereft
of
all
that
could
sustain
the
troops
still
what
could
be
done
wellington
did
and
did
it
nobly
fighting
a
rearguard
action
he
fell
back
upon
the
grim
and
naked
ridges
of
busaco
where
at
the
end
of
september
he
delivered
battle
and
a
murderous
detaining
wound
upon
the
advancing
hosts
of
france
that
done
he
continued
the
retreat
through
coimbra
and
now
as
he
went
he
saw
to
it
that
the
devastation
was
completed
along
the
line
of
march
what
corn
and
provisions
could
not
be
carried
off
were
burnt
or
buried
and
the
people
forced
to
quit
their
dwellings
and
march
with
the
army
a
pathetic
southward
exodus
of
men
and
women
old
and
young
flocks
of
sheep
and
herds
of
cattle
creaking
laden
with
provender
and
household
goods
leaving
behind
them
a
country
bare
as
the
sahara
where
hunger
before
long
should
grip
the
french
army
too
far
committed
now
to
pause
in
advancing
and
overtaking
must
lie
massena
s
hope
eventually
in
lisbon
he
must
bring
the
british
to
bay
and
breaking
them
open
out
at
last
his
way
into
a
land
of
plenty
thus
thought
massena
knowing
nothing
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
and
thus
too
thought
the
british
government
at
home
itself
declaring
that
wellington
was
ruining
the
country
to
no
purpose
since
in
the
end
the
british
must
be
driven
out
with
terrible
loss
and
infamy
that
must
make
their
name
an
opprobrium
in
the
world
but
wellington
went
his
relentless
way
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
of
october
brought
his
army
and
the
multitude
of
refugees
safely
within
the
amazing
lines
the
french
pressing
hard
upon
their
heels
and
confident
that
the
end
was
near
were
brought
up
sharply
before
those
stupendous
unsuspected
impregnable
fortifications
after
spending
best
part
of
a
month
in
vain
reconnoitering
massena
took
up
his
quarters
at
santarem
and
thence
the
country
was
scoured
for
what
scraps
of
victuals
had
been
left
to
relieve
the
dire
straits
of
the
famished
host
of
france
how
the
great
marshal
contrived
to
hold
out
so
long
in
santarem
against
the
onslaught
of
famine
and
concomitant
disease
remains
something
of
a
mystery
an
appeal
to
the
emperor
for
succour
eventually
brought
drouet
with
provisions
but
these
were
no
more
than
would
keep
his
men
alive
on
a
retreat
into
spain
and
that
retreat
he
commenced
early
in
the
following
march
by
when
no
less
than
ten
thousand
of
his
army
had
fallen
sick
instantly
wellington
was
up
and
after
him
the
french
retreat
became
a
flight
they
threw
away
baggage
and
ammunition
that
they
might
travel
the
lighter
thus
they
fled
towards
spain
harassed
by
the
british
cavalry
and
scarcely
less
by
the
resentful
peasantry
of
portugal
their
line
of
march
defined
by
an
unbroken
trail
of
carcasses
until
the
tattered
remnants
of
that
once
splendid
army
found
shelter
across
the
coira
beyond
this
wellington
could
not
continue
the
pursuit
for
lack
of
means
to
cross
the
swollen
river
and
also
because
provisions
were
running
short
but
there
for
the
moment
he
might
rest
content
his
immediate
object
achieved
and
his
stern
strategy
supremely
vindicated
on
the
heights
above
the
yellow
turgid
flood
rode
wellington
with
a
glittering
staff
that
included
o
moy
and
murray
the
through
his
telescope
he
surveyed
with
silent
satisfaction
the
straggling
columns
of
the
french
that
were
being
absorbed
by
the
evening
mists
from
the
sodden
ground
o
moy
at
his
side
looked
on
without
satisfaction
to
him
the
close
of
this
phase
of
the
campaign
which
had
justified
his
remaining
in
office
meant
the
reopening
of
that
painful
matter
that
had
been
left
in
suspense
by
circumstances
since
that
june
day
of
last
year
at
monsanto
the
resignation
then
refused
from
motives
of
expediency
must
again
be
tendered
and
must
now
be
accepted
abruptly
upon
the
general
stillness
came
a
sharply
humming
sound
within
a
yard
of
the
spot
where
wellington
sat
his
horse
a
handful
of
soil
heaved
itself
up
and
fell
in
a
tiny
scattered
shower
immediately
elsewhere
in
a
dozen
places
was
the
phenomenon
repeated
there
was
too
much
glitter
about
the
staff
uniforms
and
vindictive
french
sharpshooters
were
finding
them
an
attractive
mark
they
are
firing
on
us
sir
cried
o
moy
on
a
note
of
sharp
alarm
so
i
perceive
lord
wellington
answered
calmly
and
leisurely
he
closed
his
glass
so
leisurely
that
o
moy
in
impatient
fear
of
his
chief
spurred
forward
and
placed
himself
as
a
screen
between
him
and
the
line
of
fire
lord
wellington
looked
at
him
with
a
faint
smile
he
was
about
to
speak
when
o
moy
pitched
forward
and
rolled
headlong
from
the
saddle
they
picked
him
up
unconscious
but
alive
and
for
once
lord
wellington
was
seen
to
blench
as
he
flung
down
from
his
horse
to
inquire
the
nature
of
o
moy
s
hurt
it
was
not
fatal
but
as
it
afterwards
proved
it
was
grave
enough
he
had
been
shot
through
the
body
the
right
lung
had
been
grazed
and
one
of
his
ribs
broken
two
days
later
after
the
bullet
had
been
extracted
lord
wellington
went
to
visit
him
in
the
house
where
he
was
quartered
bending
over
him
and
speaking
quietly
his
lordship
said
that
which
brought
a
moisture
to
the
eyes
of
sir
terence
and
a
smile
to
his
pale
lips
what
actually
were
his
lordship
s
words
may
be
gathered
from
the
answer
he
received
ye
re
entirely
wrong
then
and
it
s
mighty
glad
i
am
for
now
i
need
no
longer
hand
you
my
resignation
i
can
be
invalided
so
he
was
and
thus
it
happens
that
not
until
now
when
this
chronicle
makes
the
matter
public
does
the
knowledge
of
sir
terence
s
single
but
grievous
departure
from
the
path
of
honour
go
beyond
the
few
who
were
immediately
concerned
with
it
they
kept
faith
with
him
because
they
loved
him
and
because
they
had
understood
all
that
went
to
the
making
of
his
sin
they
condoned
it
if
i
have
done
my
duty
as
a
faithful
chronicler
you
who
read
understanding
too
will
take
satisfaction
in
that
it
was
so
