the
adventures
of
sally
by
wodehouse
chapter
sally
gives
a
party
sally
looked
contentedly
down
the
long
table
she
felt
happy
at
last
everybody
was
talking
and
laughing
now
and
her
party
rallying
after
an
uncertain
start
was
plainly
the
success
she
had
hoped
it
would
be
the
first
atmosphere
of
uncomfortable
restraint
caused
she
was
only
too
well
aware
by
her
brother
fillmore
white
evening
waistcoat
had
worn
off
and
the
male
and
female
patrons
of
meecher
select
transient
and
residential
were
themselves
again
at
her
end
of
the
table
the
conversation
had
turned
once
more
to
the
great
vital
topic
of
sally
legacy
and
what
she
ought
to
do
with
it
the
next
best
thing
to
having
money
of
one
own
is
to
dictate
the
spending
of
somebody
else
and
sally
guests
were
finding
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
in
arranging
a
budget
for
her
rumour
having
put
the
sum
at
their
disposal
at
a
high
figure
their
suggestions
had
certain
spaciousness
let
me
tell
you
said
augustus
bartlett
briskly
what
i
do
if
i
were
augustus
bartlett
who
occupied
an
intensely
subordinate
position
in
the
firm
of
kahn
morris
and
brown
the
wall
street
brokers
always
affected
a
brisk
incisive
style
of
speech
as
befitted
a
man
in
close
touch
with
the
great
ones
of
finance
i
sink
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
in
some
good
safe
we
just
put
one
out
which
you
would
do
well
to
consider
and
play
about
with
the
rest
when
i
say
play
about
i
mean
have
a
flutter
in
anything
good
that
crops
up
multiple
steel
worth
looking
at
they
tell
me
it
be
up
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
before
next
elsa
doland
the
pretty
girl
with
the
big
eyes
who
sat
on
left
had
other
views
buy
a
theatre
sally
and
put
on
good
and
lose
every
bean
you
got
said
a
mild
young
man
with
a
deep
voice
across
the
table
if
i
had
a
few
hundred
thousand
said
the
mild
young
man
i
put
every
cent
of
it
on
benny
whistler
for
the
heavyweight
championship
i
private
information
that
battling
tuke
has
been
got
at
and
means
to
lie
down
in
the
seventh
say
listen
interrupted
another
voice
lem
me
tell
you
what
i
do
with
four
hundred
thousand
if
i
had
four
hundred
thousand
said
elsa
doland
i
know
what
would
be
the
first
thing
i
what
that
asked
sally
pay
my
bill
for
last
week
due
this
sally
got
up
quickly
and
flitting
down
the
table
put
her
arm
round
her
friend
shoulder
and
whispered
in
her
ear
elsa
darling
are
you
really
broke
if
you
are
you
know
i
elsa
doland
laughed
you
an
angel
sally
there
no
one
like
you
you
give
your
last
cent
to
anyone
of
course
i
not
broke
i
just
come
back
from
the
road
and
i
saved
a
fortune
i
only
said
that
to
draw
sally
returned
to
her
seat
relieved
and
found
that
the
company
had
now
divided
itself
into
two
schools
of
thought
the
conservative
and
prudent
element
led
by
augustus
bartlett
had
definitely
decided
on
three
hundred
thousand
in
liberty
bonds
and
the
rest
in
some
safe
real
estate
while
the
smaller
more
sporting
section
impressed
by
the
mild
young
man
inside
information
had
already
placed
sally
money
on
benny
whistler
doling
it
out
cautiously
in
small
sums
so
as
not
to
spoil
the
market
and
so
solid
it
seemed
was
tuke
reputation
with
those
in
the
inner
circle
of
knowledge
that
the
mild
young
man
was
confident
that
if
you
went
about
the
matter
cannily
and
without
precipitation
three
to
one
might
be
obtained
it
seemed
to
sally
that
the
time
had
come
to
correct
certain
misapprehensions
i
do
know
where
you
get
your
figures
she
said
but
i
afraid
they
wrong
i
just
thousand
the
statement
had
a
chilling
effect
to
these
jugglers
with
the
amount
mentioned
seemed
for
the
moment
almost
too
small
to
bother
about
it
was
the
sort
of
sum
which
they
had
been
mentally
setting
aside
for
the
heiress
car
fare
then
they
managed
to
adjust
their
minds
to
it
after
all
one
could
do
something
even
with
a
pittance
like
thousand
if
i
thousand
said
augustus
bartlett
the
first
to
rally
from
the
shock
i
buy
amalgamated
if
i
had
thousand
began
elsa
doland
if
i
had
thousand
in
the
year
nineteen
hundred
observed
a
man
with
spectacles
i
could
have
started
a
revolution
in
he
brooded
sombrely
on
what
might
have
been
well
i
tell
you
exactly
what
i
going
to
do
said
sally
going
to
start
with
a
trip
to
europe
france
specially
i
heard
france
well
spoken
of
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
passport
and
after
loafed
there
for
a
few
weeks
i
coming
back
to
look
about
and
find
some
nice
cosy
little
business
which
will
let
me
put
money
into
it
and
keep
me
in
luxury
are
there
any
complaints
even
a
couple
of
thousand
on
benny
whistler
said
the
mild
young
man
i
do
want
your
benny
whistler
said
sally
i
would
have
him
if
you
gave
him
to
me
if
i
want
to
lose
money
i
go
to
monte
carlo
and
do
it
monte
carlo
said
the
gloomy
man
brightening
up
at
the
magic
name
i
was
in
monte
carlo
in
the
year
and
if
i
had
another
fifty
dollars
just
fifty
i
have
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
there
was
a
stir
a
cough
and
the
grating
of
a
chair
on
the
floor
and
slowly
with
that
easy
grace
which
actors
of
the
old
school
learned
in
the
days
when
acting
was
acting
maxwell
faucitt
the
oldest
inhabitant
rose
to
his
feet
ladies
said
faucitt
bowing
courteously
and
ceasing
to
bow
and
casting
from
beneath
his
white
and
venerable
eyebrows
a
quelling
glance
at
certain
male
members
of
the
younger
set
who
were
showing
a
disposition
towards
restiveness
gentlemen
i
feel
that
i
can
not
allow
this
occasion
to
pass
without
saying
a
few
his
audience
did
not
seem
surprised
it
was
possible
that
life
always
prolific
of
incident
in
a
great
city
like
new
york
might
some
day
produce
an
occasion
which
faucitt
would
feel
that
he
could
allow
to
pass
without
saying
a
few
words
but
nothing
of
the
sort
had
happened
as
yet
and
they
had
given
up
hope
right
from
the
start
of
the
meal
they
had
felt
that
it
would
be
optimism
run
mad
to
expect
the
old
gentleman
to
abstain
from
speech
on
the
night
of
sally
nicholas
farewell
dinner
party
and
partly
because
they
had
braced
themselves
to
it
but
principally
because
miss
nicholas
hospitality
had
left
them
with
a
genial
feeling
of
repletion
they
settled
themselves
to
listen
with
something
resembling
equanimity
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
marvellous
murphys
new
arrivals
who
had
been
playing
the
bushwick
with
their
equilibristic
act
during
the
preceding
week
to
form
a
party
of
the
extreme
left
and
heckle
the
speaker
broke
down
under
a
cold
look
from
their
hostess
brief
though
their
acquaintance
had
been
both
of
these
lissom
young
gentlemen
admired
sally
immensely
and
it
should
be
set
on
record
that
this
admiration
of
theirs
was
not
misplaced
he
would
have
been
hard
to
please
who
had
not
been
attracted
by
sally
she
was
a
small
trim
wisp
of
a
girl
with
the
tiniest
hands
and
feet
the
friendliest
of
smiles
and
a
dimple
that
came
and
went
in
the
curve
of
her
rounded
chin
her
eyes
which
disappeared
when
she
laughed
which
was
often
were
a
bright
hazel
her
hair
a
soft
mass
of
brown
she
had
moreover
a
manner
an
air
of
distinction
lacking
in
the
majority
of
meecher
guests
and
she
carried
youth
like
a
banner
in
approving
of
sally
the
marvellous
murphys
had
been
guilty
of
no
lapse
from
their
high
critical
standard
i
have
been
asked
proceeded
faucitt
though
i
am
aware
that
there
are
others
here
far
worthier
of
such
a
task
brutuses
compared
with
whom
i
like
marc
antony
am
no
orator
i
have
been
asked
to
propose
the
health
who
asked
you
it
was
the
smaller
of
the
marvellous
murphys
who
spoke
he
was
an
unpleasant
youth
and
spotty
still
he
could
balance
himself
with
one
hand
on
an
inverted
bottle
while
revolving
a
barrel
on
the
soles
of
his
feet
there
is
good
in
all
of
us
i
have
been
asked
repeated
faucitt
ignoring
the
unmannerly
interruption
which
indeed
he
would
have
found
it
hard
to
answer
to
propose
the
health
of
our
charming
hostess
applause
coupled
with
the
name
of
her
brother
our
old
friend
fillmore
the
gentleman
referred
to
who
sat
at
the
speaker
end
of
the
table
acknowledged
the
tribute
with
a
brief
nod
of
the
head
it
was
a
nod
of
condescension
the
nod
of
one
who
conscious
of
being
hedged
about
by
social
inferiors
nevertheless
does
his
best
to
be
not
unkindly
and
sally
seeing
it
debated
in
her
mind
for
an
instant
the
advisability
of
throwing
an
orange
at
her
brother
there
was
one
lying
ready
to
her
hand
and
his
glistening
offered
an
admirable
mark
but
she
restrained
herself
after
all
if
a
hostess
yields
to
her
primitive
impulses
what
happens
chaos
she
had
just
frowned
down
the
exuberance
of
the
rebellious
murphys
and
she
felt
that
if
even
with
the
highest
motives
she
began
throwing
fruit
her
influence
for
good
in
that
quarter
would
be
weakened
she
leaned
back
with
a
sigh
the
temptation
had
been
hard
to
resist
a
democratic
girl
pomposity
was
a
quality
which
she
thoroughly
disliked
and
though
she
loved
him
she
could
not
disguise
from
herself
that
ever
since
affluence
had
descended
upon
him
some
months
ago
her
brother
fillmore
had
become
insufferably
pompous
if
there
are
any
young
men
whom
inherited
wealth
improves
fillmore
nicholas
was
not
one
of
them
he
seemed
to
regard
himself
nowadays
as
a
sort
of
man
of
destiny
to
converse
with
him
was
for
the
ordinary
human
being
like
being
received
in
audience
by
some
more
than
monarch
it
had
taken
sally
over
an
hour
to
persuade
him
to
leave
his
apartment
on
riverside
drive
and
revisit
the
for
this
special
occasion
and
when
he
had
come
he
had
entered
wearing
such
faultless
evening
dress
that
he
had
made
the
rest
of
the
party
look
like
a
gathering
of
his
white
waistcoat
alone
was
a
silent
reproach
to
honest
poverty
and
had
caused
an
awkward
constraint
right
through
the
soup
and
fish
courses
most
of
those
present
had
known
fillmore
nicholas
as
an
impecunious
young
man
who
could
make
a
tweed
suit
last
longer
than
one
would
have
believed
possible
they
had
called
him
fill
and
helped
him
in
more
than
usually
lean
times
with
small
loans
but
they
had
eyed
the
waistcoat
dumbly
and
shrank
back
abashed
speaking
said
faucitt
as
an
englishman
for
though
i
have
long
since
taken
out
what
are
technically
known
as
my
it
was
as
a
subject
of
the
island
kingdom
that
i
first
visited
this
great
country
i
may
say
that
the
two
factors
in
american
life
which
have
always
made
the
profoundest
impression
upon
me
have
been
the
lavishness
of
american
hospitality
and
the
charm
of
the
american
girl
we
have
been
privileged
to
witness
the
american
girl
in
the
capacity
of
hostess
and
i
think
i
am
right
in
saying
in
asseverating
in
committing
myself
to
the
statement
that
this
has
been
a
night
which
none
of
us
present
here
will
ever
forget
miss
nicholas
has
given
us
ladies
and
gentlemen
a
banquet
i
repeat
a
banquet
there
has
been
alcoholic
refreshment
i
do
not
know
where
it
came
from
i
do
not
ask
how
it
was
procured
but
we
have
had
it
miss
nicholas
faucitt
paused
to
puff
at
his
cigar
sally
brother
fillmore
suppressed
a
yawn
and
glanced
at
his
watch
sally
continued
to
lean
forward
raptly
she
knew
how
happy
it
made
the
old
gentleman
to
deliver
a
formal
speech
and
though
she
wished
the
subject
had
been
different
she
was
prepared
to
listen
indefinitely
miss
nicholas
resumed
faucitt
lowering
his
cigar
but
why
he
demanded
abruptly
do
i
call
her
miss
nicholas
because
it
her
name
hazarded
the
taller
murphy
faucitt
eyed
him
with
disfavour
he
disapproved
of
the
marvellous
brethren
on
general
grounds
because
himself
a
resident
of
years
standing
he
considered
that
these
transients
from
the
vaudeville
stage
lowered
the
tone
of
the
but
particularly
because
the
one
who
had
just
spoken
had
on
his
first
evening
in
the
place
addressed
him
as
yes
sir
he
said
severely
it
is
her
name
but
she
has
another
name
sweeter
to
those
who
love
her
those
who
worship
her
those
who
have
watched
her
with
the
eye
of
sedulous
affection
through
the
three
years
she
has
spent
beneath
this
roof
though
that
name
said
faucitt
lowering
the
tone
of
his
address
and
descending
to
what
might
almost
be
termed
personalities
may
not
be
familiar
to
a
couple
of
dud
acrobats
who
have
only
been
in
the
place
a
thank
heaven
and
are
off
to
infest
some
other
city
that
name
said
faucitt
soaring
once
more
to
a
loftier
plane
is
sally
our
sally
for
three
years
our
sally
has
flitted
about
this
establishment
like
i
choose
the
simile
advisedly
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
for
three
years
she
has
made
life
for
us
a
brighter
sweeter
thing
and
now
a
sudden
access
of
worldly
wealth
happily
synchronizing
with
her
birthday
is
to
remove
her
from
our
midst
from
our
midst
ladies
and
gentlemen
but
not
from
our
hearts
and
i
think
i
may
venture
to
hope
to
prognosticate
that
whatever
lofty
sphere
she
may
adorn
in
the
future
to
whatever
heights
in
the
social
world
she
may
soar
she
will
still
continue
to
hold
a
corner
in
her
own
golden
heart
for
the
comrades
of
her
bohemian
days
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
give
you
our
hostess
miss
sally
nicholas
coupled
with
the
name
of
our
old
friend
her
brother
sally
watching
her
brother
heave
himself
to
his
feet
as
the
cheers
died
away
felt
her
heart
beat
a
little
faster
with
anticipation
fillmore
was
a
fluent
young
man
once
a
power
in
his
college
debating
society
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
she
had
insisted
on
his
coming
here
tonight
she
had
guessed
that
faucitt
the
old
dear
would
say
all
sorts
of
delightful
things
about
her
and
she
had
mistrusted
her
ability
to
make
a
fitting
reply
and
it
was
imperative
that
a
fitting
reply
should
proceed
from
someone
she
knew
faucitt
so
well
he
looked
on
these
occasions
rather
in
the
light
of
scenes
from
some
play
and
sustaining
his
own
part
in
them
with
such
polished
grace
was
certain
to
be
pained
by
anything
in
the
nature
of
an
after
he
should
have
ceased
to
take
the
stage
eloquent
himself
he
must
be
answered
with
eloquence
or
his
whole
evening
would
be
spoiled
fillmore
nicholas
smoothed
a
wrinkle
out
of
his
white
waistcoat
and
having
rested
one
podgy
hand
on
the
and
the
thumb
of
the
other
in
his
pocket
glanced
down
the
table
with
eyes
so
haughtily
drooping
that
sally
fingers
closed
automatically
about
her
orange
as
she
wondered
whether
even
now
it
might
not
be
a
good
thing
it
seems
to
be
one
of
nature
laws
that
the
most
attractive
girls
should
have
the
least
attractive
brothers
fillmore
nicholas
had
not
worn
well
at
the
age
of
seven
he
had
been
an
extraordinarily
beautiful
child
but
after
that
he
had
gone
all
to
pieces
and
now
at
the
age
of
it
would
be
idle
to
deny
that
he
was
something
of
a
mess
for
the
three
years
preceding
his
birthday
restricted
means
and
hard
work
had
kept
his
figure
in
check
but
with
money
there
had
come
an
sleekness
he
looked
as
if
he
fed
too
often
and
too
well
all
this
however
sally
was
prepared
to
forgive
him
if
he
would
only
make
a
good
speech
she
could
see
faucitt
leaning
back
in
his
chair
all
courteous
attention
rolling
periods
were
meat
and
drink
to
the
old
gentleman
fillmore
spoke
i
sure
said
fillmore
you
do
want
a
speech
very
good
of
you
to
drink
our
health
thank
he
sat
down
the
effect
of
these
few
simple
words
on
the
company
was
marked
but
not
in
every
case
identical
to
the
majority
the
emotion
which
they
brought
was
one
of
unmixed
relief
there
had
been
something
so
menacing
so
easy
and
practised
in
fillmore
attitude
as
he
had
stood
there
that
the
had
given
him
at
least
twenty
minutes
and
even
the
optimists
had
reckoned
that
they
would
be
lucky
if
they
got
off
with
ten
as
far
as
the
bulk
of
the
guests
were
concerned
there
was
no
grumbling
fillmore
to
their
thinking
had
been
the
ideal
speech
far
different
was
it
with
maxwell
faucitt
the
poor
old
man
was
wearing
such
an
expression
of
surprise
and
dismay
as
he
might
have
worn
had
somebody
unexpectedly
pulled
the
chair
from
under
him
he
was
feeling
the
sick
shock
which
comes
to
those
who
tread
on
a
last
stair
and
sally
catching
sight
of
his
face
uttered
a
sharp
wordless
exclamation
as
if
she
had
seen
a
child
fall
down
and
hurt
itself
in
the
street
the
next
moment
she
had
run
round
the
table
and
was
standing
behind
him
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
she
spoke
across
him
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
my
brother
she
stammered
directing
a
malevolent
look
at
the
immaculate
fillmore
who
avoiding
her
gaze
glanced
down
his
nose
and
smoothed
another
wrinkle
out
of
his
waistcoat
has
not
said
quite
quite
all
i
hoped
he
was
going
to
say
i
ca
make
a
speech
but
sally
gulped
but
i
love
you
all
and
of
course
i
shall
never
forget
you
and
and
here
sally
kissed
faucitt
and
burst
into
tears
there
there
said
faucitt
soothingly
the
kindest
critic
could
not
have
claimed
that
sally
had
been
eloquent
nevertheless
maxwell
faucitt
was
conscious
of
no
sense
of
sally
had
just
finished
telling
her
brother
fillmore
what
a
pig
he
was
the
lecture
had
taken
place
in
the
street
outside
the
immediately
on
the
conclusion
of
the
festivities
when
fillmore
who
had
furtively
collected
his
hat
and
overcoat
had
stolen
forth
into
the
night
had
been
overtaken
and
brought
to
bay
by
his
justly
indignant
sister
her
remarks
punctuated
at
intervals
by
bleating
sounds
from
the
accused
had
lasted
some
ten
minutes
as
she
paused
for
breath
fillmore
seemed
to
expand
like
an
indiarubber
ball
which
has
been
sat
on
dignified
as
he
was
to
the
world
he
had
never
been
able
to
prevent
himself
being
intimidated
by
sally
when
in
one
of
these
moods
of
hers
he
regretted
this
for
it
hurt
his
but
he
did
not
see
how
the
fact
could
be
altered
sally
had
always
been
like
that
even
the
uncle
who
after
the
deaths
of
their
parents
had
become
their
guardian
had
never
though
a
grim
man
been
able
to
cope
successfully
with
sally
in
that
last
hectic
scene
three
years
ago
which
had
ended
in
their
going
out
into
the
world
together
like
a
second
adam
and
eve
the
verbal
victory
had
been
hers
and
it
had
been
sally
who
had
achieved
triumph
in
the
one
battle
which
meecher
apparently
as
a
matter
of
duty
always
brought
about
with
each
of
her
patrons
in
the
first
week
of
their
stay
a
girl
sally
like
most
women
of
a
generous
spirit
had
cyclonic
potentialities
as
she
seemed
to
have
said
her
say
fillmore
kept
on
expanding
till
he
had
reached
the
normal
when
he
ventured
upon
a
speech
for
the
defence
what
have
i
done
demanded
fillmore
plaintively
do
you
want
to
hear
all
over
again
no
no
said
fillmore
hastily
but
listen
sally
you
understand
my
position
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
all
that
sort
of
thing
all
that
stuff
is
a
thing
of
the
past
one
got
beyond
it
one
wants
to
drop
it
one
wants
to
forget
it
darn
it
be
fair
look
at
it
from
my
viewpoint
i
going
to
be
a
big
man
you
going
to
be
a
fat
man
said
sally
coldly
fillmore
refrained
from
discussing
the
point
he
was
sensitive
i
going
to
do
big
things
he
substituted
i
got
a
deal
on
at
this
very
moment
which
well
i
ca
tell
you
about
it
but
going
to
be
big
well
what
i
driving
at
is
about
all
this
sort
of
thing
he
indicated
the
lighted
front
of
meecher
with
a
wide
gesture
is
that
it
over
finished
and
done
with
these
people
were
all
very
well
when
when
you
lost
your
week
salary
at
poker
and
wanted
to
borrow
a
few
dollars
for
the
i
always
paid
them
back
protested
fillmore
defensively
i
well
we
did
said
fillmore
accepting
the
amendment
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
no
time
for
chopping
straws
anyway
what
i
mean
is
i
do
see
why
just
because
one
has
known
people
at
a
certain
period
in
one
life
when
one
was
practically
down
and
out
one
should
have
them
round
one
neck
for
ever
one
ca
prevent
people
forming
an
club
but
darn
it
one
need
attend
the
one
friends
oh
friends
said
fillmore
that
just
where
all
this
makes
me
so
tired
one
in
a
position
where
all
these
people
are
entitled
to
call
themselves
one
friends
simply
because
father
put
it
in
his
will
that
i
was
to
get
the
money
till
i
was
instead
of
letting
me
have
it
at
like
anybody
else
i
wonder
where
i
should
have
been
by
now
if
i
could
have
got
that
money
when
i
was
in
the
probably
said
sally
fillmore
was
wounded
ah
you
do
believe
in
me
he
sighed
oh
you
would
be
all
right
if
you
had
one
thing
said
sally
fillmore
passed
his
qualities
in
swift
review
before
his
mental
eye
brains
dash
spaciousness
initiative
all
present
and
correct
he
wondered
where
sally
imagined
the
hiatus
to
exist
one
thing
he
said
what
that
a
fillmore
sense
of
injury
deepened
he
supposed
that
this
was
always
the
way
that
those
nearest
to
a
man
never
believed
in
his
ability
till
he
had
proved
it
so
masterfully
that
it
no
longer
required
the
assistance
of
faith
still
it
was
trying
and
there
was
not
much
consolation
to
be
derived
from
the
thought
that
napoleon
had
had
to
go
through
this
sort
of
thing
in
his
day
i
shall
find
my
place
in
the
world
he
said
sulkily
oh
you
find
your
place
all
right
said
sally
and
i
come
round
and
bring
you
jelly
and
read
to
you
on
the
days
when
visitors
are
allowed
oh
the
last
remark
was
addressed
to
a
young
man
who
had
been
swinging
briskly
along
the
sidewalk
from
the
direction
of
broadway
and
who
now
coming
abreast
of
them
stopped
good
evening
good
evening
miss
you
do
know
my
brother
do
you
i
do
believe
i
he
left
the
underworld
before
you
came
to
it
said
sally
you
would
think
it
to
look
at
him
but
he
was
once
a
among
the
proletariat
even
as
you
and
meecher
looks
on
him
as
a
the
two
men
shook
hands
fillmore
was
not
short
but
gerald
foster
with
his
lean
figure
seemed
to
tower
over
him
he
was
an
englishman
a
man
in
the
middle
twenties
and
very
good
to
look
at
fillmore
who
had
recently
been
going
in
for
one
of
those
courses
the
better
to
fit
himself
for
his
career
of
greatness
was
rather
impressed
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
foster
like
himself
was
one
of
those
who
get
there
if
you
are
that
kind
yourself
you
get
into
the
knack
of
recognizing
the
others
it
is
a
sort
of
gift
there
was
a
few
moments
of
desultory
conversation
of
the
kind
that
usually
follows
an
introduction
and
then
fillmore
by
no
means
sorry
to
get
the
chance
took
advantage
of
the
coming
of
this
new
arrival
to
remove
himself
he
had
not
enjoyed
his
chat
with
sally
and
it
seemed
probable
that
he
would
enjoy
a
continuation
of
it
even
less
he
was
glad
that
foster
had
happened
along
at
this
particular
juncture
excusing
himself
briefly
he
hurried
off
down
the
street
sally
stood
for
a
minute
watching
him
till
he
had
disappeared
round
the
corner
she
had
a
slightly
regretful
feeling
that
now
it
was
too
late
she
would
think
of
a
whole
lot
more
good
things
which
it
would
have
been
agreeable
to
say
to
him
and
it
had
become
obvious
to
her
that
fillmore
was
not
getting
nearly
enough
of
that
kind
of
thing
said
to
him
nowadays
then
she
dismissed
him
from
her
mind
and
turning
to
gerald
foster
slipped
her
arm
through
his
well
jerry
darling
she
said
what
a
shame
you
could
come
to
the
party
tell
me
all
about
it
was
exactly
two
months
since
sally
had
become
engaged
to
gerald
foster
but
so
rigorously
had
they
kept
the
secret
that
nobody
at
meecher
so
much
as
suspected
it
to
sally
who
all
her
life
had
hated
concealing
things
secrecy
of
any
kind
was
objectionable
but
in
this
matter
gerald
had
shown
an
odd
streak
almost
of
furtiveness
in
his
character
an
announced
engagement
complicated
life
people
fussed
about
you
and
bothered
you
people
either
watched
you
or
avoided
you
such
were
his
arguments
and
sally
who
would
have
glossed
over
and
found
excuses
for
a
disposition
on
his
part
towards
homicide
or
arson
put
them
down
to
artistic
sensitiveness
there
is
nobody
so
sensitive
as
your
artist
particularly
if
he
be
unsuccessful
and
when
an
artist
has
so
little
success
that
he
can
not
afford
to
make
a
home
for
the
woman
he
loves
his
sensitiveness
presumably
becomes
great
indeed
putting
herself
in
his
place
sally
could
see
that
a
protracted
engagement
known
by
everybody
would
be
a
standing
advertisement
of
failure
to
make
good
and
she
acquiesced
in
the
policy
of
secrecy
hoping
that
it
would
not
last
long
it
seemed
absurd
to
think
of
gerald
as
an
unsuccessful
man
he
had
in
him
as
the
recent
fillmore
had
perceived
something
dynamic
he
was
one
of
those
men
of
whom
one
could
predict
that
they
would
succeed
very
suddenly
and
rapidly
overnight
as
it
were
the
party
said
sally
went
off
they
had
passed
the
door
and
were
walking
slowly
down
the
street
everybody
enjoyed
themselves
i
think
even
though
fillmore
did
his
best
to
spoil
things
by
coming
looking
like
an
advertisement
of
what
the
smart
men
will
wear
this
season
you
did
see
his
waistcoat
just
now
he
had
covered
it
up
conscience
i
suppose
it
was
white
and
bulgy
and
gleaming
and
full
up
of
pearl
buttons
and
everything
i
saw
augustus
bartlett
curl
up
like
a
burnt
feather
when
he
caught
sight
of
it
still
time
seemed
to
heal
the
wound
and
everybody
relaxed
after
a
bit
faucitt
made
a
speech
and
i
made
a
speech
and
cried
and
oh
it
was
all
very
festive
it
only
needed
i
wish
i
could
have
come
i
had
to
go
to
that
dinner
though
sally
gerald
paused
and
sally
saw
that
he
was
electric
with
suppressed
excitement
sally
the
play
going
to
be
put
on
sally
gave
a
little
gasp
she
had
lived
this
moment
in
anticipation
for
weeks
she
had
always
known
that
sooner
or
later
this
would
happen
she
had
read
his
plays
over
and
over
again
and
was
convinced
that
they
were
wonderful
of
course
hers
was
a
biased
view
but
then
elsa
doland
also
admired
them
and
elsa
opinion
was
one
that
carried
weight
elsa
was
another
of
those
people
who
were
bound
to
succeed
suddenly
even
old
faucitt
who
was
a
stern
judge
of
acting
and
rather
inclined
to
consider
that
nowadays
there
was
no
such
thing
believed
that
she
was
a
girl
with
a
future
who
would
do
something
big
directly
she
got
her
chance
jerry
she
gave
his
arm
a
hug
how
simply
terrific
then
goble
and
kohn
have
changed
their
minds
after
all
and
want
it
i
knew
they
a
slight
cloud
seemed
to
dim
the
sunniness
of
the
author
mood
no
not
that
one
he
said
reluctantly
no
hope
there
i
afraid
i
saw
goble
this
morning
about
that
and
he
said
it
did
add
up
right
the
one
that
going
to
be
put
on
is
primrose
way
you
remember
it
got
a
big
part
for
a
girl
in
of
course
the
one
elsa
liked
so
much
well
that
just
as
good
going
to
do
it
i
thought
you
had
sent
it
out
well
it
happens
gerald
hesitated
once
more
it
seems
that
this
man
i
was
dining
with
a
man
named
cracknell
cracknell
not
the
cracknell
the
cracknell
the
one
people
are
always
talking
about
the
man
they
call
the
millionaire
yes
why
do
you
know
him
he
was
at
harvard
with
fillmore
i
never
saw
him
but
he
must
be
rather
a
painful
oh
he
all
right
not
much
brains
of
course
but
well
he
all
right
and
anyway
he
wants
to
put
the
play
well
that
splendid
said
sally
but
she
could
not
get
the
right
ring
of
enthusiasm
into
her
voice
she
had
had
ideals
for
gerald
she
had
dreamed
of
him
invading
broadway
triumphantly
under
the
banner
of
one
of
the
big
managers
whose
name
carried
a
prestige
and
there
seemed
something
unworthy
in
this
association
with
a
man
whose
chief
claim
to
eminence
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
credited
by
metropolitan
gossip
with
possessing
the
largest
private
stock
of
alcohol
in
existence
i
thought
you
would
be
pleased
said
gerald
oh
i
am
said
sally
with
the
buoyant
optimism
which
never
deserted
her
for
long
she
had
already
begun
to
cast
off
her
momentary
depression
after
all
did
it
matter
who
financed
a
play
so
long
as
it
obtained
a
production
a
manager
was
simply
a
piece
of
machinery
for
paying
the
bills
and
if
he
had
money
for
that
purpose
why
demand
asceticism
and
the
finer
sensibilities
from
him
the
real
thing
that
mattered
was
the
question
of
who
was
going
to
play
the
leading
part
that
deftly
drawn
character
which
had
so
excited
the
admiration
of
elsa
doland
she
sought
information
on
this
point
who
will
play
ruth
she
asked
you
must
have
somebody
wonderful
it
needs
a
tremendously
clever
woman
did
cracknell
say
anything
about
that
oh
yes
we
discussed
that
of
well
well
it
seems
again
sally
noticed
that
odd
almost
stealthy
embarrassment
gerald
appeared
unable
to
begin
a
sentence
without
feeling
his
way
into
it
like
a
man
creeping
cautiously
down
a
dark
alley
she
noticed
it
the
more
because
it
was
so
different
from
his
usual
direct
method
gerald
as
a
rule
was
not
one
of
those
who
apologize
for
themselves
he
was
forthright
and
masterful
and
inclined
to
talk
to
her
from
a
height
he
seemed
different
he
broke
off
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
began
again
with
a
question
do
you
know
mabel
hobson
mabel
hobson
i
seen
her
in
the
of
sally
started
a
suspicion
had
stung
her
so
monstrous
that
its
absurdity
became
manifest
the
moment
it
had
formed
and
yet
was
it
absurd
most
broadway
gossip
filtered
eventually
into
the
chiefly
through
the
medium
of
that
seasoned
sport
the
mild
young
man
who
thought
so
highly
of
the
redoubtable
benny
whistler
and
she
was
aware
that
the
name
of
reginald
cracknell
which
was
always
getting
itself
linked
with
somebody
had
been
coupled
with
that
of
miss
hobson
it
seemed
likely
that
in
this
instance
rumour
spoke
truth
for
the
lady
was
of
that
compellingly
blonde
beauty
which
attracts
the
cracknells
of
this
world
but
even
so
it
seems
that
cracknell
said
gerald
apparently
this
man
cracknell
he
was
finding
sally
bright
horrified
gaze
somewhat
trying
well
the
fact
is
cracknell
believes
in
mabel
hobson
and
well
he
thinks
this
part
would
suit
oh
jerry
could
infatuation
go
to
such
a
length
could
even
the
spacious
heart
of
a
reginald
cracknell
so
dominate
that
gentleman
small
size
in
heads
as
to
make
him
entrust
a
part
like
ruth
in
the
primrose
way
to
one
who
when
desired
by
the
producer
of
her
last
revue
to
carry
a
bowl
of
roses
across
the
stage
and
place
it
on
a
table
had
rebelled
on
the
plea
that
she
had
not
been
engaged
as
a
dancer
surely
even
lovelorn
reginald
could
perceive
that
this
was
not
the
stuff
of
which
great
emotional
actresses
are
made
oh
jerry
she
said
again
there
was
an
uncomfortable
silence
they
turned
and
walked
back
in
the
direction
of
the
somehow
gerald
arm
had
managed
to
get
itself
detached
from
sally
she
was
conscious
of
a
curious
dull
ache
that
was
almost
like
a
physical
pain
jerry
is
it
worth
it
she
burst
out
vehemently
the
question
seemed
to
sting
the
young
man
into
something
like
his
usual
decisive
speech
worth
it
of
course
it
worth
it
it
a
broadway
production
all
that
matters
good
heavens
i
been
trying
long
enough
to
get
a
play
on
broadway
and
it
is
likely
that
i
going
to
chuck
away
my
chance
when
it
comes
along
just
because
one
might
do
better
in
the
way
of
but
jerry
mabel
hobson
it
it
murder
murder
in
the
first
nonsense
she
be
all
right
the
part
will
play
itself
besides
she
has
a
personality
and
a
following
and
cracknell
will
spend
all
the
money
in
the
world
to
make
the
thing
a
success
and
it
will
be
a
start
whatever
happens
of
course
it
worth
fillmore
would
have
been
impressed
by
this
speech
he
would
have
recognized
and
respected
in
it
the
unmistakable
ring
which
characterizes
even
the
lightest
utterances
of
those
who
get
there
on
sally
it
had
not
immediately
that
effect
nevertheless
her
habit
of
making
the
best
of
things
working
together
with
that
primary
article
of
her
creed
that
the
man
she
loved
could
do
no
wrong
succeeded
finally
in
raising
her
spirits
of
course
jerry
was
right
it
would
have
been
foolish
to
refuse
a
contract
because
all
its
clauses
were
not
ideal
you
old
darling
she
said
affectionately
attaching
herself
to
the
vacant
arm
once
more
and
giving
it
a
penitent
squeeze
you
quite
right
of
course
you
are
i
can
see
it
now
i
was
only
a
little
startled
at
first
everything
going
to
be
wonderful
let
get
all
our
chickens
out
and
count
how
are
you
going
to
spend
the
money
i
know
how
i
going
to
spend
a
dollar
of
it
said
gerald
completely
restored
i
mean
the
big
money
what
a
dollar
it
pays

ginger
sally
was
sitting
with
her
back
against
a
hillock
of
golden
sand
watching
with
eyes
the
denizens
of
at
their
familiar
morning
occupations
at
roville
as
at
most
french
seashore
resorts
the
morning
is
the
time
when
the
visiting
population
assembles
in
force
on
the
beach
whiskered
fathers
of
families
made
cheerful
patches
of
colour
in
the
foreground
their
female
friends
and
relatives
clustered
in
groups
under
gay
parasols
dogs
roamed
to
and
fro
and
children
dug
industriously
with
spades
ever
and
anon
suspending
their
labours
in
order
to
smite
one
another
with
these
handy
implements
one
of
the
dogs
a
poodle
of
military
aspect
wandered
up
to
sally
and
discovering
that
she
was
in
possession
of
a
box
of
sweets
decided
to
remain
and
await
developments
few
things
are
so
pleasant
as
the
anticipation
of
them
but
vacation
had
proved
an
exception
to
this
rule
it
had
been
a
magic
month
of
lazy
happiness
she
had
drifted
luxuriously
from
one
french
town
to
another
till
the
charm
of
roville
with
its
blue
sky
its
casino
its
hotels
along
the
promenade
and
its
general
glitter
and
gaiety
had
brought
her
to
a
halt
here
she
could
have
stayed
indefinitely
but
the
voice
of
america
was
calling
her
back
gerald
had
written
to
say
that
the
primrose
way
was
to
be
produced
in
detroit
preliminary
to
its
new
york
run
so
soon
that
if
she
wished
to
see
the
opening
she
must
return
at
once
a
scrappy
hurried
unsatisfactory
letter
the
letter
of
a
busy
man
but
one
that
sally
could
not
ignore
she
was
leaving
roville
however
was
and
she
sat
and
watched
the
bathers
with
a
familiar
feeling
of
peace
revelling
as
usual
in
the
still
novel
sensation
of
having
nothing
to
do
but
bask
in
the
warm
sunshine
and
listen
to
the
faint
murmur
of
the
little
waves
but
if
there
was
one
drawback
she
had
discovered
to
a
morning
on
the
roville
plage
it
was
that
you
had
a
tendency
to
fall
asleep
and
this
is
a
degrading
thing
to
do
so
soon
after
breakfast
even
if
you
are
on
a
holiday
usually
sally
fought
stoutly
against
the
temptation
but
the
sun
was
so
warm
and
the
whisper
of
the
waves
so
insinuating
that
she
had
almost
dozed
off
when
she
was
aroused
by
voices
close
at
hand
there
were
many
voices
on
the
beach
both
near
and
distant
but
these
were
talking
english
a
novelty
in
roville
and
the
sound
of
the
familiar
tongue
jerked
sally
back
from
the
borders
of
sleep
a
few
feet
away
two
men
had
seated
themselves
on
the
sand
from
the
first
moment
she
had
set
out
on
her
travels
it
had
been
one
of
sally
principal
amusements
to
examine
the
strangers
whom
chance
threw
in
her
way
and
to
try
by
the
light
of
her
intuition
to
fit
them
out
with
characters
and
occupations
nor
had
she
been
discouraged
by
an
almost
consistent
failure
to
guess
right
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
inspected
these
two
men
the
first
of
the
pair
did
not
attract
her
he
was
a
tall
dark
man
whose
tight
precise
mouth
and
rather
high
cheeks
bones
gave
him
an
appearance
vaguely
sinister
he
had
the
dusky
look
of
the
man
whose
life
is
a
perpetual
struggle
with
a
determined
beard
he
certainly
shaved
twice
a
day
and
just
as
certainly
had
the
not
to
swear
when
he
cut
himself
she
could
picture
him
smiling
nastily
when
this
happened
hard
diagnosed
sally
i
should
like
him
a
lawyer
or
something
i
she
turned
to
the
other
and
found
herself
looking
into
his
eyes
this
was
because
he
had
been
staring
at
sally
with
the
utmost
intentness
ever
since
his
arrival
his
mouth
had
opened
slightly
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
after
many
disappointments
has
at
last
found
something
worth
looking
at
rather
a
dear
decided
sally
he
was
a
sturdy
young
man
with
an
amiable
freckled
face
and
the
reddest
hair
sally
had
ever
seen
he
had
a
square
chin
and
at
one
angle
of
the
chin
a
slight
cut
and
sally
was
convinced
that
however
he
had
behaved
on
receipt
of
that
wound
it
had
not
been
with
superior
a
temper
i
should
think
she
meditated
very
quick
but
soon
over
not
very
clever
i
should
say
but
she
looked
away
finding
his
fascinated
gaze
a
little
embarrassing
the
dark
man
who
in
the
objectionably
competent
fashion
which
one
felt
characterized
all
his
actions
had
just
succeeded
in
lighting
a
cigarette
in
the
teeth
of
a
strong
breeze
threw
away
the
match
and
resumed
the
conversation
which
had
presumably
been
interrupted
by
the
process
of
sitting
down
and
how
is
scrymgeour
he
inquired
oh
all
right
replied
the
young
man
with
red
hair
absently
sally
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
but
she
felt
that
his
eyes
were
still
busy
i
was
surprised
at
his
being
here
he
told
me
he
meant
to
stay
in
there
was
a
slight
pause
sally
gave
the
attentive
poodle
a
piece
of
nougat
i
say
observed
the
young
man
in
clear
penetrating
tones
that
vibrated
with
intense
feeling
that
the
prettiest
girl
i
seen
in
my
life
at
this
frank
revelation
of
the
young
man
personal
opinions
sally
though
considerably
startled
was
not
displeased
a
girl
the
outburst
seemed
to
her
a
legitimate
comment
on
a
matter
of
public
interest
the
young
man
companion
on
the
other
hand
was
unmixedly
shocked
my
dear
fellow
he
ejaculated
oh
it
all
right
said
the
young
man
unmoved
she
understand
there
is
a
bally
soul
in
this
dashed
place
that
can
speak
a
word
of
english
if
i
did
happen
to
remember
a
few
odd
bits
of
french
i
should
have
starved
by
this
time
that
girl
he
went
on
returning
to
the
subject
most
imperatively
occupying
his
mind
is
an
absolute
topper
i
give
you
my
solemn
word
i
never
seen
anybody
to
touch
her
look
at
those
hands
and
feet
you
do
get
them
outside
france
of
course
her
mouth
is
a
bit
wide
he
said
reluctantly
sally
immobility
added
to
the
other
assurance
concerning
the
linguistic
deficiencies
of
the
inhabitants
of
roville
seemed
to
reassure
the
dark
man
he
breathed
again
at
no
period
of
his
life
had
he
ever
behaved
with
anything
but
the
most
scrupulous
correctness
himself
but
he
had
quailed
at
the
idea
of
being
associated
even
remotely
with
incorrectness
in
another
it
had
been
a
black
moment
for
him
when
the
young
man
had
uttered
those
few
kind
words
still
you
ought
to
be
careful
he
said
austerely
he
looked
at
sally
who
was
now
dividing
her
attention
between
the
poodle
and
a
mongrel
who
had
joined
the
party
and
returned
to
the
topic
of
the
mysterious
scrymgeour
how
is
scrymgeour
dyspepsia
the
young
man
seemed
but
faintly
interested
in
the
vicissitudes
of
scrymgeour
interior
do
you
notice
the
way
her
hair
sort
of
curls
over
her
ears
he
said
eh
oh
pretty
much
the
same
i
what
hotel
are
you
staying
at
the
sally
dipping
into
the
box
for
another
chocolate
cream
gave
an
imperceptible
start
she
too
was
staying
at
the
normandie
she
presumed
that
her
admirer
was
a
recent
arrival
for
she
had
seen
nothing
of
him
at
the
hotel
the
normandie
the
dark
man
looked
puzzled
i
know
roville
pretty
well
by
report
but
i
never
heard
of
any
hotel
normandie
where
is
it
it
a
little
shanty
down
near
the
station
not
much
of
a
place
still
it
cheap
and
the
cooking
all
his
companion
bewilderment
increased
what
on
earth
is
a
man
like
scrymgeour
doing
there
he
said
sally
was
conscious
of
an
urgent
desire
to
know
more
and
more
about
the
absent
scrymgeour
constant
repetition
of
his
name
had
made
him
seem
almost
like
an
old
friend
if
there
one
thing
he
fussy
about
there
are
at
least
eleven
thousand
things
he
fussy
about
interrupted
the
young
man
disapprovingly
jumpy
old
blighter
if
there
one
thing
he
particular
about
it
the
sort
of
hotel
he
goes
to
ever
since
i
known
him
he
has
always
wanted
the
best
i
should
have
thought
he
would
have
gone
to
the
he
mused
on
this
problem
in
a
dissatisfied
sort
of
way
for
a
moment
then
seemed
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
fact
that
a
rich
man
eccentricities
must
be
humoured
i
like
to
see
him
again
ask
him
if
he
will
dine
with
me
at
the
splendide
say
eight
sally
occupied
with
her
dogs
whose
numbers
had
now
been
augmented
by
a
white
terrier
with
a
black
patch
over
its
left
eye
could
not
see
the
young
man
face
but
his
voice
when
he
replied
told
her
that
something
was
wrong
there
was
a
false
airiness
in
it
oh
scrymgeour
is
in
no
where
is
he
paris
i
what
the
dark
man
voice
sharpened
he
sounded
as
though
he
were
a
reluctant
witness
then
why
are
you
there
what
are
you
doing
here
did
he
give
you
a
holiday
yes
he
when
do
you
rejoin
him
i
what
the
young
man
manner
was
not
unmistakably
dogged
well
if
you
want
to
know
he
said
the
old
blighter
fired
me
the
day
before
there
was
a
shuffling
of
sand
as
the
dark
man
sprang
up
sally
intent
on
the
drama
which
was
unfolding
itself
beside
her
gave
the
poodle
a
piece
of
nougat
which
should
by
rights
have
gone
to
the
terrier
she
shot
a
swift
glance
sideways
and
saw
the
dark
man
standing
in
an
attitude
rather
reminiscent
of
the
stern
father
of
melodrama
about
to
drive
his
erring
daughter
out
into
the
snow
the
young
man
outwardly
stolid
was
gazing
before
him
down
the
beach
at
a
fat
bather
in
an
orange
suit
who
after
six
false
starts
was
now
actually
in
the
water
floating
with
the
dignity
of
a
wrecked
balloon
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
demanded
the
dark
man
that
after
all
the
trouble
the
family
took
to
get
you
what
was
practically
a
sinecure
with
endless
possibilities
if
you
only
behaved
yourself
you
have
deliberately
thrown
away
a
despairing
gesture
completed
the
sentence
good
god
you
hopeless
the
young
man
made
no
reply
he
continued
to
gaze
down
the
beach
of
all
outdoor
sports
few
are
more
stimulating
than
watching
frenchmen
bathe
drama
action
suspense
all
are
here
from
the
first
stealthy
testing
of
the
water
with
an
apprehensive
toe
to
the
final
plunge
there
is
never
a
dull
moment
and
apart
from
the
excitement
of
the
thing
judging
it
from
a
purely
aesthetic
standpoint
his
must
be
a
dull
soul
who
can
fail
to
be
uplifted
by
the
spectacle
of
a
series
of
very
stout
men
with
whiskers
seen
in
tight
bathing
suits
against
a
background
of
brightest
blue
yet
the
young
man
with
red
hair
recently
in
the
employment
of
scrymgeour
eyed
this
free
circus
without
any
enjoyment
whatever
it
maddening
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
do
you
expect
us
to
do
are
we
to
spend
our
whole
lives
getting
you
positions
which
you
keep
i
can
tell
you
we
it
monstrous
it
sickening
good
god
and
with
these
words
the
dark
man
apparently
feeling
as
sally
had
sometimes
felt
in
the
society
of
her
brother
fillmore
the
futility
of
mere
language
turned
sharply
and
stalked
away
up
the
beach
the
dignity
of
his
exit
somewhat
marred
a
moment
later
by
the
fact
of
his
straw
hat
blowing
off
and
being
trodden
on
by
a
passing
child
he
left
behind
him
the
sort
of
electric
calm
which
follows
the
falling
of
a
thunderbolt
that
stunned
calm
through
which
the
air
seems
still
to
quiver
protestingly
how
long
this
would
have
lasted
one
can
not
say
for
towards
the
end
of
the
first
minute
it
was
shattered
by
a
purely
terrestrial
uproar
with
an
abruptness
heralded
only
by
one
short
low
gurgling
snarl
there
sprang
into
being
the
prettiest
dog
fight
that
roville
had
seen
that
season
it
was
the
terrier
with
the
black
patch
who
began
it
that
was
opinion
and
such
one
feels
will
be
the
verdict
of
history
his
best
friend
anxious
to
make
out
a
case
for
him
could
not
have
denied
that
he
fired
the
first
gun
of
the
campaign
but
we
must
be
just
the
fault
was
really
sally
absorbed
in
the
scene
which
had
just
concluded
and
acutely
inquisitive
as
to
why
the
shadowy
scrymgeour
had
seen
fit
to
dispense
with
the
young
man
services
she
had
thrice
in
succession
helped
the
poodle
out
of
his
turn
the
third
occasion
was
too
much
for
the
terrier
there
is
about
any
dog
fight
a
wild
gusty
fury
which
affects
the
average
mortal
with
something
of
the
helplessness
induced
by
some
vast
clashing
of
the
elements
it
seems
so
outside
one
jurisdiction
one
is
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
the
futility
of
interference
and
this
was
no
ordinary
dog
fight
it
was
a
stunning
mêlée
which
would
have
excited
favourable
comment
even
among
the
blasé
residents
of
a
negro
quarter
or
the
not
critics
of
a
lancashire
from
all
over
the
beach
dogs
of
every
size
breed
and
colour
were
racing
to
the
scene
and
while
some
of
these
merely
remained
in
the
ringside
seats
and
barked
a
considerable
proportion
immediately
started
fighting
one
another
on
general
principles
well
content
to
be
in
action
without
bothering
about
first
causes
the
terrier
had
got
the
poodle
by
the
left
and
was
restating
his
the
raffish
mongrel
was
apparently
endeavouring
to
fletcherize
a
complete
stranger
of
the
sealyham
family
sally
was
frankly
unequal
to
the
situation
as
were
the
entire
crowd
of
spectators
who
had
come
galloping
up
from
the
water
edge
she
had
been
paralysed
from
the
start
snarling
bundles
bumped
against
her
legs
and
bounced
away
again
but
she
made
no
move
advice
in
fluent
french
rent
the
air
arms
waved
and
bathing
suits
leaped
up
and
down
but
nobody
did
anything
practical
until
in
the
centre
of
the
theatre
of
war
there
suddenly
appeared
the
young
man
the
only
reason
why
dog
fights
do
not
go
on
for
ever
is
that
providence
has
decided
that
on
each
such
occasion
there
shall
always
be
among
those
present
one
master
mind
one
wizard
who
whatever
his
shortcomings
in
other
battles
of
life
is
in
this
single
particular
sphere
competent
and
dominating
at
it
was
the
young
man
his
dark
companion
might
have
turned
from
him
in
disgust
his
services
might
not
have
seemed
worth
retaining
by
the
haughty
scrymgeour
he
might
be
a
pain
in
the
neck
to
the
family
but
he
did
know
how
to
stop
a
dog
fight
from
the
first
moment
of
his
intervention
calm
began
to
steal
over
the
scene
he
had
the
same
effect
on
the
almost
inextricably
entwined
belligerents
as
in
mediaeval
legend
the
holy
grail
sliding
down
the
sunbeam
used
to
have
on
battling
knights
he
did
not
look
like
a
dove
of
peace
but
the
most
captious
could
not
have
denied
that
he
brought
home
the
goods
there
was
a
magic
in
his
soothing
hands
a
spell
in
his
voice
and
in
a
shorter
time
than
one
would
have
believed
possible
dog
after
dog
had
been
sorted
out
and
calmed
down
until
presently
all
that
was
left
of
armageddon
was
one
solitary
small
scotch
terrier
thoughtfully
licking
a
chewed
leg
the
rest
of
the
combatants
once
more
in
their
right
mind
and
wondering
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
had
been
captured
and
haled
away
in
a
whirl
of
recrimination
by
voluble
owners
having
achieved
this
miracle
the
young
man
turned
to
sally
gallant
one
might
say
reckless
as
he
had
been
a
moment
before
he
now
gave
indications
of
a
rather
pleasing
shyness
he
braced
himself
with
that
painful
air
of
effort
which
announces
to
the
world
that
an
englishman
is
about
to
speak
a
language
other
than
his
own
he
said
having
swallowed
once
or
twice
to
brace
himself
up
for
the
journey
through
the
jungle
of
a
foreign
tongue
que
vous
pas
oh
dammit
what
the
word
que
vous
pas
blessée
blessée
yes
blessée
wounded
hurt
do
you
know
bitten
oh
dash
it
oh
bitten
said
sally
dimpling
oh
no
thanks
very
much
i
bitten
and
i
think
it
was
awfully
brave
of
you
to
save
all
our
the
compliment
seemed
to
pass
over
the
young
man
head
he
stared
at
sally
with
horrified
eyes
over
his
amiable
face
there
swept
a
vivid
blush
his
jaw
dropped
oh
my
sainted
aunt
he
ejaculated
then
as
if
the
situation
was
too
much
for
him
and
flight
the
only
possible
solution
he
spun
round
and
disappeared
at
a
walk
so
rapid
that
it
was
almost
a
run
sally
watched
him
go
and
was
sorry
that
he
had
torn
himself
away
she
still
wanted
to
know
why
scrymgeour
had
fired
him
bedtime
at
roville
is
an
hour
that
seems
to
vary
according
to
proximity
to
the
sea
the
gilded
palaces
along
the
front
keep
deplorable
hours
polluting
the
night
air
till
dawn
with
indefatigable
jazz
but
at
the
pensions
of
the
economical
like
the
normandie
early
to
bed
is
the
rule
true
jules
the
stout
young
native
who
combined
the
offices
of
and
lift
attendant
at
that
establishment
was
on
duty
in
the
hall
throughout
the
night
but
few
of
the
normandie
patrons
made
use
of
his
services
sally
entering
shortly
before
twelve
on
the
night
of
the
day
on
which
the
dark
man
the
young
man
and
their
friend
scrymgeour
had
come
into
her
life
found
the
little
hall
dim
and
silent
through
the
iron
cage
of
the
lift
a
single
faint
bulb
glowed
another
over
the
desk
in
the
far
corner
illuminated
the
upper
half
of
jules
slumbering
in
a
chair
jules
seemed
to
sally
to
be
on
duty
in
some
capacity
or
other
all
the
time
his
work
like
women
was
never
done
he
was
now
restoring
his
tissues
with
a
few
winks
of
beauty
sleep
sally
who
had
been
to
the
casino
to
hear
the
band
and
afterwards
had
strolled
on
the
moonlit
promenade
had
a
guilty
sense
of
intrusion
as
she
stood
there
reluctant
to
break
in
on
jules
rest
for
her
sympathetic
heart
always
at
the
disposal
of
the
oppressed
had
long
ached
for
this
overworked
peon
she
was
relieved
to
hear
footsteps
in
the
street
outside
followed
by
the
opening
of
the
front
door
if
jules
would
have
had
to
wake
up
anyway
she
felt
her
sense
of
responsibility
lessened
the
door
having
opened
closed
again
with
a
bang
jules
stirred
gurgled
blinked
and
sat
up
and
sally
turning
perceived
that
the
new
arrival
was
the
young
man
oh
good
evening
said
sally
welcomingly
the
young
man
stopped
and
shuffled
uncomfortably
the
happenings
were
obviously
still
green
in
his
memory
he
had
either
not
ceased
blushing
since
their
last
meeting
or
he
was
celebrating
their
reunion
by
beginning
to
blush
again
for
his
face
was
a
familiar
scarlet
er
good
evening
he
said
disentangling
his
feet
which
in
the
embarrassment
of
the
moment
had
somehow
got
coiled
up
together
or
bon
soir
i
suppose
you
would
say
murmured
sally
the
young
man
acknowledged
receipt
of
this
thrust
by
dropping
his
hat
and
tripping
over
it
as
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
jules
meanwhile
who
had
been
navigating
in
a
sort
of
somnambulistic
trance
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lift
now
threw
back
the
cage
with
a
rattle
it
a
shame
to
have
woken
you
up
said
sally
commiseratingly
stepping
in
jules
did
not
reply
for
the
excellent
reason
that
he
had
not
been
woken
up
constant
practice
enabled
him
to
do
this
sort
of
work
without
breaking
his
slumber
his
brain
if
you
could
call
it
that
was
working
automatically
he
had
shut
up
the
gate
with
a
clang
and
was
tugging
sluggishly
at
the
correct
rope
so
that
the
lift
was
going
slowly
up
instead
of
retiring
down
into
the
basement
but
he
was
not
awake
sally
and
the
young
man
sat
side
by
side
on
the
small
seat
watching
their
conductor
efforts
after
the
first
spurt
conversation
had
languished
sally
had
nothing
of
immediate
interest
to
say
and
her
companion
seemed
to
be
one
of
these
strong
silent
men
you
read
about
only
a
slight
snore
from
jules
broke
the
silence
at
the
third
floor
sally
leaned
forward
and
prodded
jules
in
the
lower
ribs
all
through
her
stay
at
roville
she
had
found
in
dealing
with
the
native
population
that
actions
spoke
louder
than
words
if
she
wanted
anything
in
a
restaurant
or
at
a
shop
she
pointed
and
when
she
wished
the
lift
to
stop
she
prodded
the
man
in
charge
it
was
a
system
worth
a
dozen
french
conversation
books
jules
brought
the
machine
to
a
halt
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
he
should
have
done
the
one
thing
connected
with
his
professional
activities
which
he
did
really
well
the
opening
to
wit
of
the
iron
cage
there
are
ways
of
doing
this
jules
was
the
right
way
he
was
accustomed
to
do
it
with
a
flourish
and
generally
remarked
in
a
modest
but
voice
as
though
he
would
have
liked
to
see
another
man
who
could
have
put
through
a
job
like
that
opinion
was
that
he
might
not
be
much
to
look
at
but
that
he
could
open
a
lift
door
however
it
seemed
as
if
even
this
not
very
exacting
feat
was
beyond
his
powers
instead
of
inserting
his
key
in
the
lock
he
stood
staring
in
an
attitude
of
frozen
horror
he
was
a
man
who
took
most
things
in
life
pretty
seriously
and
whatever
was
the
little
difficulty
just
now
seemed
to
have
broken
him
all
up
there
appears
said
sally
turning
to
her
companion
to
be
a
hitch
would
you
mind
asking
what
the
matter
i
do
know
any
french
myself
except
la
la
the
young
man
thus
appealed
to
nerved
himself
to
the
task
he
eyed
the
melancholy
jules
doubtfully
and
coughed
in
a
strangled
sort
of
way
oh
esker
esker
vous
do
weaken
said
sally
i
think
you
got
him
esker
vous
pourquoi
vous
ne
i
mean
ne
vous
that
is
to
say
quel
est
le
raison
he
broke
off
here
because
at
this
point
jules
began
to
explain
he
explained
very
rapidly
and
at
considerable
length
the
fact
that
neither
of
his
hearers
understood
a
word
of
what
he
was
saying
appeared
not
to
have
impressed
itself
upon
him
or
if
he
gave
a
thought
to
it
he
dismissed
the
objection
as
trifling
he
wanted
to
explain
and
he
explained
words
rushed
from
him
like
water
from
a
geyser
sounds
which
you
felt
you
would
have
been
able
to
put
a
meaning
to
if
he
had
detached
them
from
the
main
body
and
repeated
them
slowly
went
swirling
down
the
stream
and
were
lost
for
ever
stop
him
said
sally
firmly
the
young
man
looked
as
a
native
of
johnstown
might
have
looked
on
being
requested
to
stop
that
city
celebrated
flood
stop
him
yes
blow
a
whistle
or
out
of
the
depths
of
the
young
man
memory
there
swam
to
the
surface
a
single
word
a
word
which
he
must
have
heard
somewhere
or
read
somewhere
a
legacy
perhaps
from
zut
he
barked
and
instantaneously
jules
turned
himself
off
at
the
main
there
was
a
moment
of
dazed
silence
such
as
might
occur
in
a
if
the
works
suddenly
shut
down
quick
now
you
got
him
cried
sally
ask
him
what
he
talking
about
if
he
knows
which
i
doubt
and
tell
him
to
speak
slowly
then
we
shall
get
the
young
man
nodded
intelligently
the
advice
was
good
lentement
he
said
parlez
lentement
pas
si
you
know
what
i
mean
pas
si
dashed
vite
cried
jules
catching
the
idea
on
the
fly
lentement
ah
oui
there
followed
a
lengthy
conversation
which
while
conveying
nothing
to
sally
seemed
intelligible
to
the
linguist
the
silly
ass
he
was
able
to
announce
some
few
minutes
later
has
made
a
bloomer
apparently
he
was
half
asleep
when
we
came
in
and
he
shoved
us
into
the
lift
and
slammed
the
door
forgetting
that
he
had
left
the
keys
on
the
i
see
said
sally
so
we
shut
in
i
afraid
so
i
wish
to
goodness
said
the
young
man
i
knew
french
well
i
curse
him
with
some
vim
and
not
a
little
animation
the
chump
i
wonder
what
is
in
french
he
said
meditating
it
the
merest
suggestion
said
sally
but
ought
we
to
do
something
what
could
we
do
well
for
one
thing
we
might
all
utter
a
loud
yell
it
would
scare
most
of
the
people
in
the
hotel
to
death
but
there
might
be
a
survivor
or
two
who
would
come
and
investigate
and
let
us
what
a
ripping
idea
said
the
young
man
impressed
i
glad
you
like
it
now
tell
him
the
main
or
he
think
we
gone
the
young
man
searched
for
words
and
eventually
found
some
which
expressed
his
meaning
lamely
but
well
enough
to
cause
jules
to
nod
in
a
depressed
sort
of
way
fine
said
sally
now
all
together
at
the
word
one
two
oh
poor
darling
she
broke
off
look
at
him
in
the
far
corner
of
the
lift
the
emotional
jules
was
sobbing
silently
into
the
bunch
of
which
served
him
in
the
office
of
a
his
gulps
echoed
hollowly
down
the
shaft
in
these
days
of
cheap
books
of
instruction
on
every
subject
under
the
sun
we
most
of
us
know
how
to
behave
in
the
majority
of
life
little
crises
we
have
only
ourselves
to
blame
if
we
are
ignorant
of
what
to
do
before
the
doctor
comes
of
how
to
make
a
dainty
winter
coat
for
baby
out
of
father
last
year
and
of
the
best
method
of
coping
with
the
cold
mutton
but
nobody
yet
has
come
forward
with
practical
advice
as
to
the
correct
method
of
behaviour
to
be
adopted
when
a
starts
crying
and
sally
and
her
companion
as
a
consequence
for
a
few
moments
merely
stared
at
each
other
helplessly
poor
darling
said
sally
finding
speech
ask
him
what
the
the
young
man
looked
at
her
doubtfully
you
know
he
said
i
do
enjoy
chatting
with
this
blighter
i
mean
to
say
it
a
bit
of
an
effort
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
talking
french
always
makes
me
feel
as
if
my
nose
were
coming
off
could
we
just
leave
him
to
have
his
cry
out
by
himself
the
idea
said
sally
have
you
no
heart
are
you
one
of
those
fiends
in
human
shape
he
turned
reluctantly
to
jules
and
paused
to
overhaul
his
vocabulary
you
ought
to
be
thankful
for
this
chance
said
sally
it
the
only
real
way
of
learning
french
and
you
getting
a
lesson
for
nothing
what
did
he
say
then
something
about
losing
something
it
seemed
to
me
i
thought
i
caught
the
word
but
that
means
a
partridge
does
it
i
sure
i
seen
it
on
the
would
he
talk
about
partridges
at
a
time
like
this
he
might
the
french
are
extraordinary
well
i
have
another
go
at
him
but
he
a
difficult
chap
to
chat
with
if
you
give
him
the
least
encouragement
he
sort
of
goes
off
like
a
he
addressed
another
question
to
the
sufferer
and
listened
attentively
to
the
voluble
reply
oh
he
said
with
sudden
enlightenment
your
job
he
turned
to
sally
i
got
it
that
time
he
said
the
trouble
is
he
says
that
if
we
yell
and
rouse
the
house
we
get
out
all
right
but
he
will
lose
his
job
because
this
is
the
second
time
this
sort
of
thing
has
happened
and
they
warned
him
last
time
that
once
more
would
mean
the
then
we
must
dream
of
yelling
said
sally
decidedly
it
means
a
pretty
long
wait
you
know
as
far
as
i
can
gather
there
just
a
chance
of
somebody
else
coming
in
later
in
which
case
he
could
let
us
out
but
it
doubtful
he
rather
thinks
that
everybody
has
gone
to
well
we
must
try
it
i
would
think
of
losing
the
poor
man
his
job
tell
him
to
take
the
car
down
to
the
and
then
we
just
sit
and
amuse
ourselves
till
something
happens
we
lots
to
talk
about
we
can
tell
each
other
the
story
of
our
jules
cheered
by
his
victims
kindly
forbearance
lowered
the
car
to
the
ground
floor
where
after
a
glance
of
infinite
longing
at
the
keys
on
the
distant
desk
the
sort
of
glance
which
moses
must
have
cast
at
the
promised
land
from
the
summit
of
mount
pisgah
he
sagged
down
in
a
heap
and
resumed
his
slumbers
sally
settled
herself
as
comfortably
as
possible
in
her
corner
you
better
smoke
she
said
it
will
be
something
to
thanks
and
now
said
sally
tell
me
why
scrymgeour
fired
little
by
little
under
the
stimulating
influence
of
this
nocturnal
adventure
the
young
man
had
lost
that
shy
confusion
which
had
rendered
him
so
ill
at
ease
when
he
had
encountered
sally
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
but
at
this
question
embarrassment
gripped
him
once
more
another
of
those
comprehensive
blushes
of
his
raced
over
his
face
and
he
stammered
i
say
i
glad
i
fearfully
sorry
about
that
you
know
about
scrymgeour
you
know
what
i
mean
i
mean
about
making
such
a
most
ghastly
ass
of
myself
this
morning
i
i
never
dreamed
you
understood
why
i
did
object
i
thought
you
were
very
nice
and
complimentary
of
course
i
do
know
how
many
girls
you
seen
in
your
life
but
no
i
say
do
it
makes
me
feel
such
a
and
i
sorry
about
my
mouth
it
is
wide
but
i
know
you
a
man
and
realize
that
it
is
my
do
rub
it
in
pleaded
the
young
man
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you
want
to
know
i
think
your
mouth
is
absolutely
perfect
i
think
he
proceeded
a
little
feverishly
that
you
are
the
most
indescribable
topper
that
ever
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
scrymgeour
said
sally
the
young
man
blinked
as
if
he
had
collided
with
some
hard
object
while
eloquence
had
carried
him
away
scrymgeour
he
said
oh
that
would
bore
do
be
silly
said
sally
reprovingly
ca
you
realize
that
practically
castaways
on
a
desert
island
there
nothing
to
do
till
but
talk
about
ourselves
i
want
to
hear
all
about
you
and
then
i
tell
you
all
about
myself
if
you
feel
diffident
about
starting
the
revelations
i
begin
better
start
with
names
mine
is
sally
nicholas
what
yours
mine
oh
ah
yes
i
see
what
you
i
thought
you
would
i
put
it
as
clearly
as
i
could
well
what
is
it
and
the
first
name
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
the
young
man
i
always
rather
hushed
up
my
first
name
because
when
i
was
christened
they
worked
a
trick
on
me
you
ca
shock
me
said
sally
encouragingly
my
father
name
was
ezekiel
and
i
a
brother
who
was
christened
kemp
brightened
well
mine
is
as
bad
as
that
no
i
mean
that
he
broke
off
apologetically
both
awfully
jolly
names
of
course
get
on
said
sally
well
they
called
me
lancelot
and
of
course
the
thing
is
that
i
do
look
like
a
lancelot
and
never
shall
my
pals
he
added
in
a
more
cheerful
strain
call
me
i
do
blame
them
said
sally
perhaps
you
would
mind
thinking
of
me
as
ginger
suggested
the
young
man
diffidently
that
awfully
good
of
not
at
jules
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
grunted
no
other
sound
came
to
disturb
the
stillness
of
the
night
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
yourself
said
lancelot
ginger
kemp
i
going
to
tell
you
all
about
myself
said
sally
not
because
i
think
it
will
interest
you
oh
it
will
not
i
say
because
i
think
it
will
interest
you
it
will
sally
looked
at
him
coldly
is
this
a
duet
she
inquired
or
have
i
the
floor
i
awfully
not
i
repeat
for
the
third
time
because
i
think
it
will
interest
you
but
because
if
i
do
you
wo
have
any
excuse
for
not
telling
me
your
and
you
would
believe
how
inquisitive
i
am
well
in
the
first
place
i
live
in
america
i
over
here
on
a
holiday
and
the
first
real
holiday
i
had
in
three
years
since
i
left
home
in
sally
paused
i
ran
away
from
home
she
said
good
egg
said
ginger
kemp
i
beg
your
pardon
i
mean
quite
right
i
bet
you
were
quite
when
i
say
home
sally
went
on
it
was
only
a
sort
of
imitation
home
you
know
one
of
those
homes
which
are
never
as
satisfactory
as
the
real
kind
my
father
and
mother
both
died
a
good
many
years
ago
my
brother
and
i
were
dumped
down
on
the
reluctant
doorstep
of
an
uncles
said
ginger
kemp
feelingly
are
the
devil
i
got
an
but
i
interrupting
my
uncle
was
our
trustee
he
had
control
of
all
my
brother
money
and
mine
till
i
was
my
brother
was
to
get
his
when
he
was
my
poor
father
trusted
him
blindly
and
what
do
you
think
happened
good
lord
the
blighter
embezzled
the
lot
no
not
a
cent
was
it
extraordinary
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
blindly
trusted
uncle
who
was
perfectly
honest
well
mine
was
but
the
trouble
was
that
while
an
excellent
man
to
have
looking
after
money
he
was
a
very
lovable
character
he
was
very
hard
hard
he
was
as
hard
as
well
nearly
as
hard
as
this
seat
he
hated
poor
fill
phil
i
broke
it
to
you
just
now
that
my
brother
name
was
oh
your
brother
oh
ah
he
was
always
picking
on
poor
fill
and
i
bound
to
say
that
fill
rather
laid
himself
out
as
what
you
might
call
a
pickee
he
was
always
getting
into
trouble
one
day
about
three
years
ago
he
was
expelled
from
harvard
and
my
uncle
vowed
he
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
so
i
said
if
fill
left
i
would
leave
and
as
this
seemed
to
be
my
uncle
idea
of
a
large
evening
no
objection
was
raised
and
fill
and
i
departed
we
went
to
new
york
and
there
we
been
ever
since
about
six
months
ago
fill
passed
the
mark
and
collected
his
money
and
last
month
i
marched
past
the
given
point
and
got
mine
so
it
all
ends
happily
you
see
now
tell
me
about
but
i
say
you
know
dash
it
you
skipped
a
lot
i
mean
to
say
you
must
have
had
an
awful
time
in
new
york
did
you
how
on
earth
did
you
get
along
oh
we
found
work
my
brother
tried
one
or
two
things
and
finally
became
an
assistant
with
some
theatre
people
the
only
thing
i
could
do
having
been
raised
in
enervating
luxury
was
ballroom
dancing
so
i
danced
i
got
a
job
at
a
place
in
broadway
called
flower
garden
as
what
is
humorously
called
an
as
if
anybody
could
the
men
who
came
there
one
was
lucky
if
one
saved
one
life
and
was
quashed
to
how
perfectly
foul
oh
i
do
know
it
was
rather
fun
for
a
while
still
said
sally
meditatively
i
not
saying
i
could
have
held
out
much
longer
i
was
beginning
to
give
i
suppose
i
been
trampled
underfoot
by
more
fat
men
than
any
other
girl
of
my
age
in
america
i
do
know
why
it
was
but
every
man
who
came
in
who
was
a
bit
overweight
seemed
to
make
for
me
by
instinct
that
why
i
like
to
sit
on
the
sands
here
and
watch
these
frenchmen
bathing
it
just
heavenly
to
lie
back
and
watch
a
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
man
coming
along
and
feel
that
he
is
going
to
dance
with
but
i
say
how
absolutely
rotten
it
must
have
been
for
you
well
i
tell
you
one
thing
it
going
to
make
me
a
very
domesticated
wife
one
of
these
days
you
wo
find
me
gadding
about
in
gilded
for
me
a
little
place
in
the
country
somewhere
with
my
knitting
and
an
elsie
book
and
bed
at
nine
and
now
tell
me
the
story
of
your
life
and
make
it
long
because
i
perfectly
certain
there
going
to
be
no
i
sure
the
last
dweller
under
this
roof
came
in
years
ago
we
shall
be
here
till
i
really
think
we
had
better
shout
you
and
lose
jules
his
job
never
well
of
course
i
sorry
for
poor
old
jules
troubles
but
i
hate
to
think
of
you
having
to
now
get
on
with
the
story
said
sally
ginger
kemp
exhibited
some
of
the
symptoms
of
a
young
bridegroom
called
upon
at
a
to
respond
to
the
toast
he
moved
his
feet
restlessly
and
twisted
his
fingers
i
hate
talking
about
myself
you
know
he
said
so
i
supposed
said
sally
that
why
i
gave
you
my
autobiography
first
to
give
you
no
chance
of
backing
out
do
be
such
a
shrinking
violet
we
all
shipwrecked
mariners
here
i
am
intensely
interested
in
your
narrative
and
even
if
i
was
i
much
rather
listen
to
it
than
to
jules
he
is
snoring
a
bit
what
does
it
annoy
you
shall
i
stir
him
you
seem
to
have
an
extraordinary
brutal
streak
in
your
nature
said
sally
you
appear
to
think
of
nothing
else
but
schemes
for
harassing
poor
jules
leave
him
alone
for
a
second
and
start
telling
me
about
where
shall
i
start
well
not
with
your
childhood
i
think
we
skip
well
ginger
kemp
knitted
his
brow
searching
for
a
dramatic
opening
well
i
more
or
less
what
you
might
call
an
orphan
like
you
i
mean
to
say
both
my
people
are
dead
and
all
that
sort
of
thanks
for
explaining
that
has
made
it
quite
i
ca
remember
my
mother
my
father
died
when
i
was
in
my
last
year
at
cambridge
i
been
having
a
most
awfully
good
time
at
the
said
ginger
warming
to
his
theme
not
thick
you
know
but
good
i
got
my
rugger
and
boxing
blues
and
i
just
been
picked
for
for
england
against
the
north
in
the
first
trial
match
and
between
ourselves
it
really
did
look
as
if
i
was
more
or
less
of
a
snip
for
my
sally
gazed
at
him
wide
eyed
is
that
good
or
bad
she
asked
eh
are
you
reciting
a
catalogue
of
your
crimes
or
do
you
expect
me
to
get
up
and
cheer
what
is
a
rugger
blue
to
start
with
well
it
it
a
rugger
blue
you
oh
i
see
said
sally
you
mean
a
rugger
i
mean
to
say
i
played
rugger
footer
that
to
say
football
rugby
football
for
cambridge
against
oxford
i
was
and
what
is
a
asked
sally
patiently
yes
i
know
going
to
say
it
a
but
ca
you
make
it
easier
the
said
ginger
is
the
half
who
works
the
scrum
he
slings
the
pill
out
to
the
who
starts
the
going
i
do
know
if
you
understand
i
it
dashed
hard
to
explain
said
ginger
kemp
unhappily
i
mean
i
do
think
i
ever
met
anyone
before
who
did
know
what
a
well
i
can
see
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
football
so
leave
it
at
that
i
suppose
it
something
like
our
and
what
an
international
it
called
getting
your
international
when
you
play
for
england
you
know
england
plays
wales
france
ireland
and
scotland
if
it
been
for
the
smash
i
think
i
should
have
played
for
england
against
i
see
at
last
what
you
trying
to
tell
me
is
that
you
were
very
good
at
ginger
kemp
blushed
warmly
oh
i
do
say
that
england
was
pretty
short
of
that
what
a
horrible
thing
to
happen
to
a
country
still
you
were
likely
to
be
picked
on
the
team
when
the
smash
came
what
was
the
smash
well
it
turned
out
that
the
poor
old
pater
had
left
a
penny
i
never
understood
the
process
exactly
but
i
always
supposed
that
we
were
pretty
well
off
and
then
it
turned
out
that
i
had
anything
at
all
i
bound
to
say
it
was
a
bit
of
a
jar
i
had
to
come
down
from
cambridge
and
go
to
work
in
my
uncle
office
of
course
i
made
an
absolute
hash
of
why
of
course
well
i
not
a
very
clever
sort
of
chap
you
see
i
somehow
seem
able
to
grasp
the
workings
after
about
a
year
my
uncle
getting
a
bit
hoofed
me
out
and
got
me
a
mastership
at
a
school
and
i
made
a
hash
of
that
he
got
me
one
or
two
other
jobs
and
i
made
a
hash
of
you
certainly
do
seem
to
be
one
of
our
most
prominent
young
hashers
gasped
sally
i
am
said
ginger
modestly
there
was
a
silence
and
what
about
scrymgeour
sally
asked
that
was
the
last
of
the
jobs
said
ginger
scrymgeour
is
a
pompous
old
ass
who
thinks
he
going
to
be
prime
minister
some
day
he
a
big
bug
at
the
bar
and
has
just
got
into
parliament
my
cousin
used
to
devil
for
him
that
how
i
got
mixed
up
with
the
your
cousin
used
i
wish
you
would
talk
that
was
my
cousin
who
was
with
me
on
the
beach
this
and
what
did
you
say
he
used
to
do
for
scrymgeour
oh
it
called
devilling
my
cousin
at
the
bar
too
one
of
our
rising
nibs
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
thought
he
was
a
lawyer
of
some
he
got
a
long
way
beyond
it
now
but
when
he
started
he
used
to
devil
for
scrymgeour
assist
him
do
you
know
his
name
carmyle
you
know
perhaps
you
heard
of
him
he
rather
a
prominent
johnny
in
his
way
bruce
carmyle
you
i
well
he
got
me
this
job
of
secretary
to
and
why
did
scrymgeour
fire
you
ginger
kemp
face
darkened
he
frowned
sally
watching
him
felt
that
she
had
been
right
when
she
had
guessed
that
he
had
a
temper
she
liked
him
none
the
worse
for
it
mild
men
did
not
appeal
to
her
i
do
know
if
you
fond
of
dogs
said
ginger
i
used
to
be
before
this
morning
said
sally
and
i
suppose
i
shall
be
again
in
time
for
the
moment
i
had
what
you
might
call
rather
a
surfeit
of
dogs
but
are
you
straying
from
the
point
i
asked
you
why
scrymgeour
dismissed
i
telling
i
glad
of
that
i
did
the
old
brute
said
ginger
frowning
again
has
a
dog
a
very
jolly
little
spaniel
great
pal
of
mine
and
scrymgeour
is
the
sort
of
fool
who
ought
to
be
allowed
to
own
a
dog
he
one
of
those
asses
who
is
fit
to
own
a
dog
as
a
matter
of
fact
of
all
the
blighted
pompous
bullying
old
devils
one
moment
said
sally
i
getting
an
impression
that
you
do
like
scrymgeour
am
i
right
yes
i
thought
so
womanly
intuition
go
he
used
to
insist
on
the
poor
animal
doing
tricks
i
hate
seeing
a
dog
do
tricks
dogs
loathe
it
you
know
they
frightfully
sensitive
well
scrymgeour
used
to
make
this
spaniel
of
his
do
tricks
that
no
dogs
would
do
and
eventually
poor
old
billy
got
fed
up
and
jibbed
he
was
too
polite
to
bite
but
he
sort
of
shook
his
head
and
crawled
under
a
chair
you
have
thought
anyone
would
have
let
it
go
at
that
but
would
old
scrymgeour
not
a
bit
of
it
of
all
the
poisonous
yes
i
know
go
well
the
thing
ended
in
the
blighter
hauling
him
out
from
under
the
chair
and
getting
more
and
more
shirty
until
finally
he
laid
into
him
with
a
stick
that
is
to
say
said
ginger
coldly
accurate
he
started
laying
into
him
with
a
he
brooded
for
a
moment
with
knit
brows
a
spaniel
mind
you
can
you
imagine
anyone
beating
a
spaniel
like
hitting
a
little
girl
well
he
a
fairly
oldish
man
you
know
and
that
hampered
me
a
bit
but
i
got
hold
of
the
stick
and
broke
it
into
about
eleven
pieces
and
by
great
good
luck
it
was
a
stick
he
happened
to
value
rather
highly
it
had
a
gold
knob
and
had
been
presented
to
him
by
his
constituents
or
something
i
minced
it
up
a
goodish
bit
and
then
i
told
him
a
fair
amount
about
himself
and
then
well
after
that
he
shot
me
out
and
i
came
sally
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
you
were
quite
right
she
said
at
last
in
a
sober
voice
that
had
nothing
in
it
of
her
customary
flippancy
she
paused
again
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
she
said
i
do
you
get
something
oh
yes
i
shall
get
something
i
suppose
the
family
will
be
pretty
sick
of
for
goodness
sake
why
do
you
bother
about
the
family
sally
burst
out
she
could
not
reconcile
this
young
man
flabby
dependence
on
his
family
with
the
enterprise
and
vigour
which
he
had
shown
in
his
dealings
with
the
unspeakable
scrymgeour
of
course
he
had
been
brought
up
to
look
on
himself
as
a
rich
man
son
and
appeared
to
have
drifted
as
such
young
men
are
wont
to
do
but
even
so
the
whole
trouble
with
you
she
said
embarking
on
a
subject
on
which
she
held
strong
views
is
that
her
harangue
was
interrupted
by
what
at
the
normandie
at
one
in
the
morning
practically
amounted
to
a
miracle
the
front
door
of
the
hotel
opened
and
there
entered
a
young
man
in
evening
dress
such
persons
were
sufficiently
rare
at
the
normandie
which
catered
principally
for
the
staid
and
and
this
youth
presence
was
due
if
one
must
pause
to
explain
it
to
the
fact
that
in
the
middle
of
his
stay
at
roville
a
disastrous
evening
at
the
casino
had
so
diminished
his
funds
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
make
a
hurried
shift
from
the
hotel
splendide
to
the
humbler
normandie
his
late
appearance
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
he
had
been
attending
a
dance
at
the
splendide
principally
in
the
hope
of
finding
there
some
friend
of
his
prosperity
from
whom
he
might
borrow
a
dialogue
having
taken
place
between
jules
and
the
newcomer
the
keys
were
handed
through
the
cage
the
door
opened
and
the
lift
was
set
once
more
in
motion
and
a
few
minutes
later
sally
suddenly
aware
of
an
overpowering
sleepiness
had
switched
off
her
light
and
jumped
into
bed
her
last
waking
thought
was
a
regret
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
speak
at
length
to
ginger
kemp
on
the
subject
of
enterprise
and
resolve
that
the
address
should
be
delivered
at
the
earliest
opportunity
chapter
iii
the
dignified
carmyle
by
six
on
the
following
evening
however
sally
had
been
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
ginger
would
have
to
struggle
through
life
as
best
he
could
without
the
assistance
of
her
contemplated
remarks
for
she
had
seen
nothing
of
him
all
day
and
in
another
hour
she
would
have
left
roville
on
the
express
which
was
to
take
her
to
paris
en
route
for
cherbourg
and
the
liner
whereon
she
had
booked
her
passage
for
new
york
it
was
in
the
faint
hope
of
finding
him
even
now
that
at
six
having
conveyed
her
baggage
to
the
station
and
left
it
in
charge
of
an
amiable
porter
she
paid
a
last
visit
to
the
casino
municipale
she
disliked
the
thought
of
leaving
ginger
without
having
uplifted
him
like
so
many
alert
and
girls
she
possessed
in
a
great
degree
the
quality
of
interesting
herself
in
or
as
her
brother
fillmore
preferred
to
put
it
messing
about
with
the
private
affairs
of
others
ginger
had
impressed
her
as
a
man
to
whom
it
was
worth
while
to
give
a
friendly
shove
on
the
right
path
and
it
was
with
much
gratification
therefore
that
having
entered
the
casino
she
perceived
a
flaming
head
shining
through
the
crowd
which
had
gathered
at
one
of
the
there
are
two
casinos
at
the
one
on
the
promenade
goes
in
mostly
for
and
a
mild
game
called
boule
it
is
the
big
casino
municipale
down
in
the
palace
massena
near
the
railway
station
which
is
the
haunt
of
the
earnest
gambler
who
means
business
and
it
was
plain
to
sally
directly
she
arrived
that
ginger
kemp
not
only
meant
business
but
was
getting
results
ginger
was
going
extremely
strong
he
was
entrenched
behind
an
mound
of
square
counters
and
even
as
sally
looked
a
croupier
shoved
a
further
instalment
across
the
table
to
him
at
the
end
of
his
long
rake
epatant
murmured
a
wistful
man
at
sally
side
removing
an
elbow
from
her
ribs
in
order
the
better
to
gesticulate
sally
though
no
french
scholar
gathered
that
he
was
startled
and
gratified
the
entire
crowd
seemed
to
be
startled
and
gratified
there
is
undoubtedly
a
certain
altruism
in
the
of
the
spectators
at
a
continental
they
seem
to
derive
a
spiritual
pleasure
from
seeing
somebody
else
win
the
croupier
gave
his
moustache
a
twist
with
his
left
hand
and
the
wheel
a
twist
with
his
right
and
silence
fell
again
sally
who
had
shifted
to
a
spot
where
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
was
less
acute
was
now
able
to
see
ginger
face
and
as
she
saw
it
she
gave
an
involuntary
laugh
he
looked
exactly
like
a
dog
at
a
his
hair
seemed
to
bristle
with
excitement
one
could
almost
fancy
that
his
ears
were
pricked
up
in
the
tense
hush
which
had
fallen
on
the
crowd
at
the
restarting
of
the
wheel
sally
laugh
rang
out
with
an
embarrassing
clearness
it
had
a
marked
effect
on
all
those
within
hearing
there
is
something
almost
of
religious
ecstasy
in
the
deportment
of
the
spectators
at
a
table
where
anyone
is
having
a
run
of
luck
at
roulette
and
if
she
had
guffawed
in
a
cathedral
she
could
not
have
caused
a
more
pained
consternation
the
earnest
worshippers
gazed
at
her
with
shocked
eyes
and
ginger
turning
with
a
start
saw
her
and
jumped
up
as
he
did
so
the
ball
fell
with
a
rattling
click
into
a
red
compartment
of
the
wheel
and
as
it
ceased
to
revolve
and
it
was
seen
that
at
last
the
big
winner
had
picked
the
wrong
colour
a
shuddering
groan
ran
through
the
congregation
like
that
which
convulses
the
penitents
bench
at
a
negro
revival
meeting
more
glances
of
reproach
were
cast
at
sally
it
was
generally
felt
that
her
injudicious
behaviour
had
changed
ginger
luck
the
only
person
who
did
not
appear
to
be
concerned
was
ginger
himself
he
gathered
up
his
loot
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
elbowed
his
way
to
where
sally
stood
now
definitely
established
in
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
as
a
pariah
there
was
universal
regret
that
he
had
decided
to
call
it
a
day
it
was
to
the
spectators
as
though
a
star
had
suddenly
walked
off
the
stage
in
the
middle
of
his
big
scene
and
not
even
a
loud
and
violent
quarrel
which
sprang
up
at
this
moment
between
two
excitable
gamblers
over
a
disputed
counter
could
wholly
console
them
i
say
said
ginger
dexterously
plucking
sally
out
of
the
crowd
this
is
topping
meeting
you
like
this
i
been
looking
for
you
it
funny
you
did
find
me
then
for
that
where
i
been
i
was
looking
for
no
really
ginger
seemed
pleased
he
led
the
way
to
the
quiet
outside
the
and
they
sat
down
in
a
corner
it
was
pleasant
here
with
nobody
near
except
the
gorgeously
uniformed
attendant
over
by
the
door
that
was
awfully
good
of
i
felt
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
before
my
train
ginger
started
violently
your
train
what
do
you
mean
the
explained
sally
i
leaving
you
leaving
ginger
looked
as
horrified
as
the
devoutest
of
the
congregation
of
which
sally
had
just
ceased
to
be
a
member
you
mean
leaving
you
not
going
away
from
roville
i
afraid
but
why
where
are
you
going
back
to
america
my
boat
sails
from
cherbourg
oh
my
aunt
i
sorry
said
sally
touched
by
his
concern
she
was
a
girl
and
liked
being
appreciated
but
i
say
ginger
kemp
turned
bright
scarlet
and
glared
before
him
at
the
uniformed
official
who
was
regarding
their
with
the
indulgent
eye
of
one
who
has
been
through
this
sort
of
thing
himself
i
say
look
here
will
you
marry
me
sally
stared
at
his
vermilion
profile
in
frank
amazement
ginger
she
had
realized
by
this
time
was
in
many
ways
a
surprising
young
man
but
she
had
not
expected
him
to
be
as
surprising
as
this
marry
you
you
know
what
i
well
yes
i
suppose
i
do
you
allude
to
the
holy
state
yes
i
know
what
you
then
how
about
it
sally
began
to
regain
her
composure
her
sense
of
humour
was
tickled
she
looked
at
ginger
gravely
he
did
not
meet
her
eye
but
continued
to
drink
in
the
uniformed
official
who
was
by
now
so
carried
away
by
the
romance
of
it
all
that
he
had
begun
to
hum
a
under
his
breath
the
official
could
not
hear
what
they
were
saying
and
would
not
have
been
able
to
understand
it
even
if
he
could
have
heard
but
he
was
an
expert
in
the
language
of
the
eyes
but
is
this
do
think
i
am
trying
to
make
difficulties
this
a
little
sudden
it
got
to
be
sudden
said
ginger
kemp
complainingly
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
here
for
but
my
infant
my
babe
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
we
are
practically
strangers
she
patted
his
hand
tolerantly
causing
the
uniformed
official
to
heave
a
tender
sigh
i
see
what
has
happened
she
said
you
mistaking
me
for
some
other
girl
some
girl
you
know
really
well
and
were
properly
introduced
to
take
a
good
look
at
me
and
you
if
i
take
a
good
look
at
you
said
ginger
feverishly
i
dashed
if
i
answer
for
the
and
this
is
the
man
i
was
going
to
lecture
on
you
the
most
wonderful
girl
i
ever
met
dash
it
said
ginger
his
gaze
still
riveted
on
the
official
by
the
door
i
dare
say
it
is
sudden
i
ca
help
that
i
fell
in
love
with
you
the
moment
i
saw
you
and
there
you
are
but
now
look
here
i
know
i
not
much
of
a
chap
and
all
that
but
well
i
just
won
the
deuce
of
a
lot
of
money
in
there
would
you
buy
me
with
your
gold
i
mean
to
say
we
should
have
enough
to
start
on
and
of
course
made
an
infernal
hash
of
everything
i
tried
up
till
now
but
there
must
be
something
i
can
do
and
you
can
jolly
well
bet
i
have
a
goodish
stab
at
it
i
mean
to
say
with
you
to
buck
me
up
and
so
forth
do
you
know
well
i
mean
has
it
struck
you
that
i
may
already
be
engaged
to
someone
else
oh
golly
are
you
for
the
first
time
he
turned
and
faced
her
and
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
which
touched
sally
and
drove
all
sense
of
the
ludicrous
out
of
her
absurd
as
it
was
this
man
was
really
serious
well
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
she
said
soberly
ginger
kemp
bit
his
lip
and
for
a
moment
was
silent
oh
well
that
torn
it
he
said
at
last
sally
was
aware
of
an
emotion
too
complex
to
analyse
there
was
pity
in
it
but
amusement
too
the
emotion
though
she
did
not
recognize
it
was
maternal
mothers
listening
to
their
children
pleading
with
engaging
absurdity
for
something
wholly
out
of
their
power
to
bestow
feel
that
same
wavering
between
tears
and
laughter
sally
wanted
to
pick
ginger
up
and
kiss
him
the
one
thing
she
could
not
do
was
to
look
on
him
sorry
as
she
was
for
him
as
a
reasonable
man
you
do
really
mean
it
you
do
i
said
ginger
hollowly
oh
do
i
you
ca
there
is
such
a
thing
in
real
life
as
love
at
first
sight
love
a
thing
that
comes
when
you
know
a
person
well
and
she
paused
it
had
just
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
hardly
the
girl
to
lecture
in
this
strain
her
love
for
gerald
foster
had
been
sufficiently
sudden
even
instantaneous
what
did
she
know
of
gerald
except
that
she
loved
him
they
had
become
engaged
within
two
weeks
of
their
first
meeting
she
found
this
recollection
damping
to
her
eloquence
and
ended
by
saying
tamely
it
ginger
had
simmered
down
to
a
mood
of
melancholy
resignation
i
could
have
expected
you
to
care
for
me
i
suppose
anyway
he
said
sombrely
i
not
much
of
a
it
was
just
the
diversion
from
the
theme
under
discussion
which
sally
had
been
longing
to
find
she
welcomed
the
chance
of
continuing
the
conversation
on
a
less
intimate
and
sentimental
note
that
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
she
said
seizing
the
opportunity
offered
by
this
display
of
humility
i
been
looking
for
you
all
day
to
go
on
with
what
i
was
starting
to
say
in
the
lift
last
night
when
we
were
interrupted
do
you
mind
if
i
talk
to
you
like
an
aunt
or
a
sister
suppose
we
say
really
the
best
plan
would
be
for
you
to
adopt
me
as
an
honorary
sister
what
do
you
think
ginger
did
not
appear
noticeably
elated
at
the
suggested
relationship
because
i
really
do
take
a
tremendous
interest
in
ginger
brightened
that
awfully
good
of
i
going
to
speak
words
of
wisdom
ginger
why
do
you
brace
up
brace
up
yes
stiffen
your
backbone
and
stick
out
your
chin
and
square
your
elbows
and
really
amount
to
something
why
do
you
simply
flop
about
and
do
nothing
and
leave
everything
to
what
you
call
family
why
do
you
have
to
be
helped
all
the
time
why
do
you
help
yourself
why
do
you
have
to
have
jobs
found
for
you
why
do
you
rush
out
and
get
one
why
do
you
have
to
worry
about
what
family
thinks
of
you
why
do
you
make
yourself
independent
of
them
i
know
you
had
hard
luck
suddenly
finding
yourself
without
money
and
all
that
but
good
heavens
everybody
else
in
the
world
who
has
ever
done
anything
has
been
broke
at
one
time
or
another
it
part
of
the
fun
you
never
get
anywhere
by
letting
yourself
be
picked
up
by
the
family
like
like
a
floppy
newfoundland
puppy
and
dumped
down
in
any
old
place
that
happens
to
suit
them
a
job
a
thing
you
got
to
choose
for
yourself
and
get
for
yourself
think
what
you
can
do
there
must
be
something
and
then
go
at
it
with
a
snort
and
grab
it
and
hold
it
down
and
teach
it
to
take
a
joke
you
managed
to
collect
some
money
it
will
give
you
time
to
look
round
and
when
you
had
a
look
round
do
something
try
to
realize
you
alive
and
try
to
imagine
the
family
is
sally
stopped
and
drew
a
deep
breath
ginger
kemp
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
he
seemed
greatly
impressed
when
you
talk
quick
he
said
at
length
in
a
serious
meditative
voice
your
nose
sort
of
goes
all
squiggly
ripping
it
looks
sally
uttered
an
indignant
cry
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
been
listening
to
a
word
i
been
saying
she
demanded
oh
rather
oh
by
jove
well
what
did
i
say
you
er
and
your
eyes
sort
of
shine
never
mind
my
eyes
what
did
i
say
you
told
me
said
ginger
on
reflection
to
get
a
well
yes
i
put
it
much
better
than
that
but
that
what
it
amounted
to
i
suppose
all
right
then
i
glad
you
ginger
was
eyeing
her
with
mournful
devotion
i
say
he
interrupted
i
wish
you
let
me
write
to
you
letters
i
mean
and
all
that
i
have
an
idea
it
would
kind
of
buck
me
you
wo
have
time
for
writing
i
have
time
to
write
them
to
you
you
have
an
address
or
anything
of
that
sort
in
america
have
you
by
any
chance
i
mean
so
that
know
where
to
write
i
can
give
you
an
address
which
will
always
find
she
told
him
the
number
and
street
of
meecher
and
he
wrote
them
down
reverently
on
his
yes
on
second
thoughts
do
write
she
said
of
course
i
shall
want
to
know
how
you
got
on
i
oh
my
goodness
that
clock
not
right
just
about
what
time
does
your
train
go
go
it
gone
or
at
least
it
goes
in
about
two
she
made
a
rush
for
the
to
the
confusion
of
the
uniformed
official
who
had
not
been
expecting
this
sudden
activity
ginger
write
to
me
and
remember
what
i
ginger
alert
after
his
unexpected
fashion
when
it
became
a
question
of
physical
action
had
followed
her
through
the
and
they
emerged
together
and
started
running
down
the
square
stick
it
said
ginger
encouragingly
he
was
running
easily
and
well
as
becomes
a
man
who
in
his
day
had
been
a
snip
for
his
international
at
sally
saved
her
breath
the
train
was
beginning
to
move
slowly
out
of
the
station
as
they
sprinted
abreast
on
to
the
platform
ginger
dived
for
the
nearest
door
wrenched
it
open
gathered
sally
neatly
in
his
arms
and
flung
her
in
she
landed
squarely
on
the
toes
of
a
man
who
occupied
the
corner
seat
and
bounding
off
again
made
for
the
window
ginger
faithful
to
the
last
was
trotting
beside
the
train
as
it
gathered
speed
ginger
my
poor
porter
tip
him
i
right
ho
and
do
forget
what
i
been
right
ho
look
after
yourself
and
to
the
family
right
ho
the
train
passed
smoothly
out
of
the
station
sally
cast
one
last
look
back
at
her
friend
who
had
now
halted
and
was
waving
a
handkerchief
then
she
turned
to
apologize
to
the
other
occupant
of
the
carriage
i
so
sorry
she
said
breathlessly
i
hope
i
did
hurt
she
found
herself
facing
ginger
cousin
the
dark
man
of
episode
on
the
beach
bruce
carmyle
carmyle
was
not
a
man
who
readily
allowed
himself
to
be
disturbed
by
life
little
surprises
but
at
the
present
moment
he
could
not
help
feeling
slightly
dazed
he
recognized
sally
now
as
the
french
girl
who
had
attracted
his
cousin
lancelot
notice
on
the
beach
at
least
he
had
assumed
that
she
was
french
and
it
was
startling
to
be
addressed
by
her
now
in
fluent
english
how
had
she
suddenly
acquired
this
gift
of
tongues
and
how
on
earth
had
she
had
time
since
yesterday
when
he
had
been
a
total
stranger
to
her
to
become
sufficiently
intimate
with
cousin
lancelot
to
be
sprinting
with
him
down
station
platforms
and
addressing
him
out
of
windows
as
ginger
bruce
carmyle
was
aware
that
most
members
of
that
of
humanity
his
cousin
personal
friends
called
him
by
that
familiar
and
so
carmyle
held
vulgar
nickname
but
how
had
this
girl
got
hold
of
it
if
sally
had
been
less
pretty
carmyle
would
undoubtedly
have
looked
disapprovingly
at
her
for
she
had
given
his
rather
rigid
sense
of
the
proprieties
a
nasty
jar
but
as
panting
and
flushed
from
her
run
she
was
prettier
than
any
girl
he
had
yet
met
he
contrived
to
smile
not
at
all
he
said
in
answer
to
her
question
though
it
was
far
from
the
truth
his
left
big
toe
was
aching
confoundedly
even
a
girl
with
a
foot
as
small
as
sally
can
make
her
presence
felt
on
a
man
toe
if
the
who
is
handling
her
aims
well
and
uses
plenty
of
vigour
if
you
do
mind
said
sally
sitting
down
i
think
i
breathe
a
she
breathed
the
train
sped
on
quite
a
close
thing
said
bruce
carmyle
affably
the
pain
in
his
toe
was
diminishing
you
nearly
missed
yes
it
was
lucky
kemp
was
with
me
he
throws
very
straight
does
tell
me
said
carmyle
how
do
you
come
to
know
my
cousin
on
the
beach
yesterday
morning
oh
we
did
know
each
other
then
but
we
were
staying
at
the
same
hotel
and
we
spent
an
hour
or
so
shut
up
in
an
elevator
together
that
was
when
we
really
got
a
waiter
entered
the
compartment
announcing
in
unexpected
english
that
dinner
was
served
in
the
restaurant
car
would
you
care
for
dinner
i
starving
said
sally
she
reproved
herself
as
they
made
their
way
down
the
corridor
for
being
so
foolish
as
to
judge
anyone
by
his
appearance
this
man
was
perfectly
pleasant
in
spite
of
his
grim
exterior
she
had
decided
by
the
time
they
had
seated
themselves
at
the
table
she
liked
him
at
the
table
however
carmyle
manner
changed
for
the
worse
he
lost
his
amiability
he
was
evidently
a
man
who
took
his
meals
seriously
and
believed
in
treating
waiters
with
severity
he
shuddered
austerely
at
a
stain
on
the
and
then
concentrated
himself
frowningly
on
the
bill
of
fare
sally
meanwhile
was
establishing
cosy
relations
with
the
much
too
friendly
waiter
a
cheerful
old
man
who
from
the
start
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
to
regard
her
as
a
favourite
daughter
the
waiter
talked
no
english
and
sally
no
french
but
they
were
getting
along
capitally
when
carmyle
who
had
been
irritably
waving
aside
the
servitor
advice
at
the
hotel
splendide
the
waiters
never
bent
over
you
and
breathed
cordial
suggestions
down
the
side
of
your
face
gave
his
order
crisply
in
the
dialect
of
the
travelling
briton
the
waiter
remarked
boum
in
a
pleased
sort
of
way
and
vanished
nice
old
man
said
sally
infernally
familiar
said
carmyle
sally
perceived
that
on
the
topic
of
the
waiter
she
and
her
host
did
not
see
eye
to
eye
and
that
little
pleasure
or
profit
could
be
derived
from
any
discussion
centring
about
him
she
changed
the
subject
she
was
not
liking
carmyle
quite
so
much
as
she
had
done
a
few
minutes
ago
but
it
was
courteous
of
him
to
give
her
dinner
and
she
tried
to
like
him
as
much
as
she
could
by
the
way
she
said
my
name
is
nicholas
i
always
think
it
a
good
thing
to
start
with
names
do
you
mine
oh
i
know
yours
ginger
kemp
told
carmyle
who
since
the
waiter
departure
had
been
thawing
stiffened
again
at
the
mention
of
ginger
indeed
he
said
coldly
apparently
you
got
sally
did
not
like
his
tone
he
seemed
to
be
criticizing
her
and
she
resented
criticism
from
a
stranger
her
eyes
opened
wide
and
she
looked
dangerously
across
the
table
why
i
told
you
that
we
had
got
intimate
and
i
explained
how
you
ca
stay
shut
up
in
an
elevator
half
the
night
with
anybody
without
getting
to
know
him
i
found
kemp
very
really
and
very
carmyle
raised
his
eyebrows
would
you
call
him
interesting
i
did
call
him
sally
was
beginning
to
feel
the
exhilaration
of
battle
men
usually
made
themselves
extremely
agreeable
to
her
and
she
reacted
belligerently
under
the
stiff
unfriendliness
which
had
come
over
her
companion
in
the
last
few
minutes
he
told
me
all
about
and
you
found
that
interesting
why
not
well
a
frigid
came
and
went
on
bruce
carmyle
dark
face
my
cousin
has
many
excellent
qualities
no
doubt
he
used
to
play
football
well
and
i
understand
that
he
is
a
capable
amateur
pugilist
but
i
should
not
have
supposed
him
entertaining
we
find
him
a
little
i
thought
it
was
only
royalty
that
called
themselves
i
meant
myself
and
the
rest
of
the
the
mention
of
the
family
was
too
much
for
sally
she
had
to
stop
talking
in
order
to
allow
her
mind
to
clear
itself
of
rude
thoughts
mr
kemp
was
telling
me
about
scrymgeour
she
went
on
at
length
bruce
carmyle
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
yard
or
so
of
french
bread
which
the
waiter
had
placed
on
the
table
indeed
he
said
he
has
an
engaging
lack
of
the
waiter
returned
bearing
soup
and
dumped
it
down
he
observed
with
the
satisfied
air
of
a
man
who
has
successfully
performed
a
difficult
conjuring
trick
he
smiled
at
sally
expectantly
as
though
confident
of
applause
from
this
section
of
his
audience
at
least
but
sally
face
was
set
and
rigid
she
had
been
snubbed
and
the
sensation
was
as
pleasant
as
it
was
novel
i
think
kemp
had
hard
luck
she
said
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
would
prefer
not
to
discuss
the
carmyle
attitude
was
that
sally
might
be
a
pretty
girl
but
she
was
a
stranger
and
the
intimate
affairs
of
the
family
were
not
to
be
discussed
with
strangers
however
prepossessing
he
was
quite
in
the
right
scrymgeour
was
beating
a
dog
i
heard
the
oh
i
did
know
that
well
do
you
agree
with
me
then
i
do
not
a
man
who
would
throw
away
an
excellent
position
simply
because
oh
well
if
that
your
view
i
suppose
it
is
useless
to
talk
about
still
there
no
harm
in
asking
what
you
propose
to
do
about
gin
about
carmyle
became
more
glacial
i
afraid
i
can
not
discuss
sally
quick
impatience
nobly
restrained
till
now
finally
got
the
better
of
her
oh
for
goodness
sake
she
snapped
do
try
to
be
human
and
always
be
snubbing
people
you
remind
me
of
one
of
those
portraits
of
men
in
the
eighteenth
century
with
wooden
faces
who
look
out
of
heavy
gold
frames
at
you
with
fishy
eyes
as
if
you
were
a
regrettable
rosbif
said
the
waiter
genially
manifesting
himself
suddenly
beside
them
as
if
he
had
popped
up
out
of
a
trap
bruce
carmyle
attacked
his
roast
beef
morosely
sally
who
was
in
the
mood
when
she
knew
that
she
would
be
ashamed
of
herself
later
on
but
was
full
of
battle
at
the
moment
sat
in
silence
i
am
sorry
said
carmyle
ponderously
if
my
eyes
are
fishy
the
fact
has
not
been
called
to
my
attention
i
suppose
you
never
had
any
sisters
said
sally
they
would
have
told
carmyle
relapsed
into
an
offended
dumbness
which
lasted
till
the
waiter
had
brought
the
coffee
i
think
said
sally
getting
up
i
be
going
now
i
do
seem
to
want
any
coffee
and
if
i
stay
on
i
may
say
something
rude
i
thought
i
might
be
able
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
kemp
and
save
him
from
being
massacred
but
apparently
it
no
use
carmyle
and
thank
you
for
giving
me
she
made
her
way
down
the
car
followed
by
bruce
carmyle
indignant
yet
fascinated
gaze
strange
emotions
were
stirring
in
bosom
chapter
iv
ginger
in
dangerous
mood
some
few
days
later
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
latter
being
preoccupied
did
not
see
him
first
bruce
carmyle
met
his
cousin
lancelot
in
piccadilly
they
had
returned
by
different
routes
from
roville
and
ginger
would
have
preferred
the
separation
to
continue
he
was
hurrying
on
with
a
nod
when
carmyle
stopped
him
just
the
man
i
wanted
to
see
he
observed
oh
hullo
said
ginger
without
joy
i
was
thinking
of
calling
at
your
yes
yes
cigarette
ginger
peered
at
the
proffered
case
with
the
vague
suspicion
of
the
man
who
has
allowed
himself
to
be
lured
on
to
the
platform
and
is
accepting
a
card
from
the
conjurer
he
felt
bewildered
in
all
the
years
of
their
acquaintance
he
could
not
recall
another
such
exhibition
of
geniality
on
his
cousin
part
he
was
surprised
indeed
at
carmyle
speaking
to
him
at
all
for
the
affaire
scrymgeour
remained
an
wound
and
the
family
ginger
knew
were
even
now
in
session
upon
it
been
back
in
london
long
day
or
i
heard
quite
by
accident
that
you
had
returned
and
that
you
were
staying
at
the
club
by
the
way
thank
you
for
introducing
me
to
miss
ginger
started
violently
what
i
was
in
that
compartment
you
know
at
roville
station
you
threw
her
right
on
top
of
me
we
agreed
to
consider
that
an
introduction
an
attractive
bruce
carmyle
had
not
entirely
made
up
his
mind
regarding
sally
but
on
one
point
he
was
clear
that
she
should
not
if
he
could
help
it
pass
out
of
his
life
her
abrupt
departure
had
left
him
with
that
baffled
and
dissatisfied
feeling
which
though
it
has
little
in
common
with
love
at
first
sight
frequently
produces
the
same
effects
she
had
had
he
could
not
disguise
it
from
himself
the
better
of
their
late
encounter
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
desire
to
meet
her
again
and
show
her
that
there
was
more
in
him
than
she
apparently
supposed
bruce
carmyle
in
a
word
was
piqued
and
though
he
could
not
quite
decide
whether
he
liked
or
disliked
sally
he
was
very
sure
that
a
future
without
her
would
have
an
element
of
flatness
a
very
attractive
girl
we
had
a
very
pleasant
i
bet
you
did
said
ginger
enviously
by
the
way
she
did
not
give
you
her
address
by
any
chance
why
said
ginger
suspiciously
his
attitude
towards
sally
address
resembled
somewhat
that
of
a
connoisseur
who
has
acquired
a
unique
work
of
art
he
wanted
to
keep
it
to
himself
and
gloat
over
it
well
i
er
i
promised
to
send
her
some
books
she
was
anxious
to
read
i
should
think
she
gets
much
time
for
books
which
are
not
published
in
oh
pretty
nearly
everything
is
published
in
america
what
bound
to
be
i
well
these
particular
books
are
not
said
carmyle
shortly
he
was
finding
ginger
reserve
a
little
trying
and
wished
that
he
had
been
more
inventive
give
them
to
me
and
i
send
them
to
her
suggested
ginger
good
lord
man
snapped
carmyle
i
capable
of
sending
a
few
books
to
america
where
does
she
live
ginger
revealed
the
sacred
number
of
the
holy
street
which
had
the
luck
to
be
sally
headquarters
he
did
it
because
with
a
persistent
devil
like
his
cousin
there
seemed
no
way
of
getting
out
of
it
but
he
did
it
grudgingly
bruce
carmyle
wrote
the
information
down
with
a
gold
pencil
in
a
dapper
little
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
always
has
a
pencil
and
the
backs
of
old
envelopes
never
enter
into
his
life
there
was
a
pause
bruce
carmyle
coughed
i
saw
uncle
donald
this
morning
he
said
his
manner
had
lost
its
geniality
there
was
no
need
for
it
now
and
he
was
a
man
who
objected
to
waste
he
spoke
coldly
and
in
his
voice
there
was
a
familiar
of
reproof
yes
said
ginger
moodily
this
was
the
uncle
in
whose
office
he
had
made
his
debut
as
a
hasher
a
worthy
man
highly
respected
in
the
national
liberal
club
but
never
a
favourite
of
ginger
there
were
other
minor
uncles
and
a
few
subsidiary
aunts
who
went
to
make
up
the
family
but
uncle
donald
was
unquestionably
the
managing
director
of
that
body
and
it
was
ginger
considered
opinion
that
in
this
capacity
he
approximated
to
a
human
blister
he
wants
you
to
dine
with
him
at
ginger
depression
deepened
a
dinner
with
uncle
donald
would
hardly
have
been
a
cheerful
function
even
in
the
surroundings
of
a
banquet
in
the
arabian
nights
there
was
that
about
uncle
donald
personality
which
would
have
cast
a
sobering
influence
over
the
orgies
of
the
emperor
tiberius
at
capri
to
dine
with
him
at
a
morgue
like
that
relic
of
old
london
bleke
coffee
house
which
confined
its
custom
principally
to
regular
patrons
who
had
not
missed
an
evening
there
for
half
a
century
was
to
touch
something
very
near
ginger
was
extremely
doubtful
whether
flesh
and
blood
were
equal
to
it
he
said
oh
you
mean
well
do
be
a
fool
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
you
got
to
uncle
donald
invitations
were
royal
commands
in
the
family
if
another
engagement
you
must
put
it
oh
all
all
right
said
ginger
gloomily
the
two
men
went
their
ways
bruce
carmyle
eastwards
because
he
had
clients
to
see
in
his
chambers
at
the
temple
ginger
westwards
because
carmyle
had
gone
east
there
was
little
sympathy
between
these
cousins
yet
oddly
enough
their
thoughts
as
they
walked
centred
on
the
same
object
bruce
carmyle
threading
his
way
briskly
through
the
crowds
of
piccadilly
circus
was
thinking
of
sally
and
so
was
ginger
as
he
loafed
aimlessly
towards
hyde
park
corner
bumping
in
a
sort
of
coma
from
pedestrian
to
pedestrian
since
his
return
to
london
ginger
had
been
in
bad
shape
he
mooned
through
the
days
and
slept
poorly
at
night
if
there
is
one
thing
rottener
than
another
in
a
pretty
blighted
world
one
thing
which
gives
a
fellow
the
pip
and
reduces
him
to
the
condition
of
an
absolute
onion
it
is
hopeless
love
hopeless
love
had
got
ginger
all
stirred
up
his
had
been
hitherto
a
placid
soul
even
the
financial
crash
which
had
so
altered
his
life
had
not
bruised
him
very
deeply
his
temperament
had
enabled
him
to
bear
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
with
a
philosophic
right
ho
but
now
everything
seemed
different
things
irritated
him
acutely
which
before
he
had
accepted
as
inevitable
his
uncle
donald
moustache
for
instance
and
its
owner
habit
of
employing
it
during
meals
as
a
sort
of
zareba
or
earthwork
against
the
assaults
of
soup
by
gad
thought
ginger
stopping
suddenly
opposite
devonshire
house
if
he
uses
that
damned
shrubbery
as
i
slosh
him
with
a
fork
hard
thoughts
hard
thoughts
and
getting
harder
all
the
time
for
nothing
grows
more
quickly
than
a
mood
of
rebellion
rebellion
is
a
forest
fire
that
flames
across
the
soul
the
spark
had
been
lighted
in
ginger
and
long
before
he
reached
hyde
park
corner
he
was
ablaze
and
crackling
by
the
time
he
returned
to
his
club
he
was
practically
a
menace
to
society
to
that
section
of
it
at
any
rate
which
embraced
his
uncle
donald
his
minor
uncles
george
and
william
and
his
aunts
mary
geraldine
and
louise
nor
had
the
mood
passed
when
he
began
to
dress
for
the
dismal
festivities
of
bleke
coffee
house
he
scowled
as
he
struggled
morosely
with
an
obstinate
tie
one
can
not
disguise
the
fact
ginger
was
warming
up
and
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
fate
as
though
it
had
been
waiting
for
the
psychological
instant
applied
the
finishing
touch
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
waiter
came
in
with
a
telegram
ginger
looked
at
the
envelope
it
had
been
readdressed
and
forwarded
on
from
the
hotel
normandie
it
was
a
wireless
handed
in
on
board
the
white
star
liner
olympic
and
it
ran
as
follows
remember
death
to
the
family
ginger
sat
down
heavily
on
the
bed
the
driver
of
the
which
at
minutes
past
seven
drew
up
at
the
dingy
door
of
bleke
coffee
house
in
the
strand
was
rather
struck
by
his
fare
manner
and
appearance
a
sort
of
young
bloke
was
the
verdict
chapter
sally
hears
news
it
had
been
sally
intention
on
arriving
in
new
york
to
take
a
room
at
the
regis
and
revel
in
the
gilded
luxury
to
which
her
wealth
entitled
her
before
moving
into
the
small
but
comfortable
apartment
which
as
soon
as
she
had
the
time
she
intended
to
find
and
make
her
permanent
abode
but
when
the
moment
came
and
she
was
giving
directions
to
the
at
the
dock
there
seemed
to
her
something
revoltingly
fillmorian
about
the
scheme
it
would
be
time
enough
to
sever
herself
from
the
which
had
been
her
home
for
three
years
when
she
had
found
the
apartment
meanwhile
the
decent
thing
to
do
if
she
did
not
want
to
brand
herself
in
the
sight
of
her
conscience
as
a
female
fillmore
was
to
go
back
temporarily
to
admirable
establishment
and
foregather
with
her
old
friends
after
all
home
is
where
the
heart
is
even
if
there
are
more
prunes
there
than
the
gourmet
would
consider
judicious
perhaps
it
was
the
unavoidable
complacency
induced
by
the
thought
that
she
was
doing
the
right
thing
or
possibly
it
was
the
tingling
expectation
of
meeting
gerald
foster
again
after
all
these
weeks
of
separation
that
made
the
familiar
streets
seem
wonderfully
bright
as
she
drove
through
them
it
was
a
perfect
crisp
new
york
morning
all
blue
sky
and
amber
sunshine
and
even
the
had
a
stimulating
look
about
them
the
street
cars
were
full
of
happy
people
rollicking
off
to
work
policemen
directed
the
traffic
with
jaunty
affability
and
the
went
about
their
poetic
tasks
with
a
quiet
but
none
the
less
noticeable
relish
it
was
improbable
that
any
of
these
people
knew
that
she
was
back
but
somehow
they
all
seemed
to
be
behaving
as
though
this
were
a
special
day
the
first
discordant
note
in
this
overture
of
happiness
was
struck
by
meecher
who
informed
sally
after
expressing
her
gratification
at
the
news
that
she
required
her
old
room
that
gerald
foster
had
left
town
that
morning
gone
to
detroit
he
has
said
meecher
miss
doland
she
broke
off
to
speak
a
caustic
word
to
the
handyman
who
with
sally
trunk
as
a
weapon
was
depreciating
the
value
of
the
in
the
hall
there
that
play
of
his
being
tried
out
there
you
know
monday
resumed
meecher
after
the
handyman
had
bumped
his
way
up
the
staircase
they
been
rehearsing
ever
since
you
sally
was
disappointed
but
it
was
such
a
beautiful
morning
and
new
york
was
so
wonderful
after
the
dull
voyage
in
the
liner
that
she
was
not
going
to
allow
herself
to
be
depressed
without
good
reason
after
all
she
could
go
on
to
detroit
tomorrow
it
was
nice
to
have
something
to
which
she
could
look
forward
oh
is
elsa
in
the
company
she
said
sure
and
very
good
too
i
meecher
kept
abreast
of
theatrical
gossip
she
was
an
of
the
profession
herself
having
been
in
the
first
production
of
florodora
though
unlike
everybody
else
not
one
of
the
original
sextette
mr
faucitt
was
down
to
see
a
rehearsal
and
he
said
miss
doland
was
fine
and
he
not
easy
to
please
as
you
how
is
faucitt
meecher
not
unwillingly
for
she
was
a
woman
who
enjoyed
the
tragedies
of
life
made
her
second
essay
in
the
direction
of
lowering
sally
uplifted
mood
poor
old
gentleman
he
ai
over
and
above
well
went
to
bed
early
last
night
with
a
headache
and
this
morning
i
been
to
see
him
and
he
do
look
well
there
a
lot
of
this
spanish
influenza
about
it
might
be
that
lots
o
people
have
been
dying
of
it
if
you
believe
what
you
see
in
the
papers
said
meecher
buoyantly
good
gracious
you
do
think
well
he
ai
turned
black
admitted
meecher
with
regret
they
say
they
turn
black
if
you
believe
what
you
see
in
the
papers
that
is
of
course
that
may
come
later
she
added
with
the
air
of
one
confident
that
all
will
come
right
in
the
future
the
doctor
be
in
to
see
him
pretty
soon
he
quite
happy
toto
sitting
with
sally
concern
increased
like
everyone
who
had
ever
spent
any
length
of
time
in
the
house
she
had
strong
views
on
toto
this
quadruped
who
stained
the
fame
of
the
entire
canine
race
by
posing
as
a
dog
was
a
small
woolly
animal
with
a
persistent
and
penetrating
yap
hard
to
bear
with
equanimity
in
health
and
certainly
quite
outside
the
range
of
a
sick
man
her
heart
bled
for
faucitt
meecher
on
the
other
hand
who
held
a
faith
in
her
little
pet
amiability
and
power
to
soothe
which
seven
years
close
association
had
been
unable
to
shake
seemed
to
feel
that
with
toto
on
the
spot
all
that
could
be
done
had
been
done
as
far
as
pampering
the
invalid
was
concerned
i
must
go
up
and
see
him
cried
sally
poor
old
sure
you
know
his
room
you
can
hear
toto
talking
to
him
now
said
meecher
complacently
he
wants
a
cracker
that
what
he
wants
toto
likes
a
cracker
after
the
invalid
eyes
as
sally
entered
the
room
turned
wearily
to
the
door
at
the
sight
of
sally
they
lit
up
with
an
incredulous
rapture
almost
any
intervention
would
have
pleased
faucitt
at
that
moment
for
his
little
playmate
had
long
outstayed
any
welcome
that
might
originally
have
been
his
but
that
the
caller
should
be
his
beloved
sally
seemed
to
the
old
man
something
in
the
nature
of
a
return
of
the
age
of
miracles
sally
one
moment
here
toto
toto
struck
momentarily
dumb
by
the
sight
of
food
had
jumped
off
the
bed
and
was
standing
with
his
head
on
one
side
peering
questioningly
at
the
cracker
he
was
a
suspicious
dog
but
he
allowed
himself
to
be
lured
into
the
passage
upon
which
sally
threw
the
cracker
down
and
slipped
in
and
shut
the
door
toto
after
a
couple
of
yaps
which
may
have
been
gratitude
or
baffled
fury
trotted
off
downstairs
and
faucitt
drew
a
deep
breath
sally
you
come
as
ever
as
an
angel
of
mercy
our
worthy
meecher
means
well
and
i
yield
to
no
man
in
my
respect
for
her
innate
kindness
of
heart
but
she
errs
in
supposing
that
that
whelp
of
hers
is
a
combination
of
soothing
medicine
and
a
week
at
the
seaside
she
insisted
on
bringing
him
here
he
was
yapping
then
as
he
was
yapping
when
with
womanly
resource
which
i
can
not
sufficiently
praise
you
decoyed
him
hence
and
each
yap
went
through
me
like
on
sheeted
tin
sally
you
stand
alone
among
womankind
you
shine
like
a
good
deed
in
a
naughty
world
when
did
you
get
back
i
only
just
arrived
in
my
hired
barouche
from
the
and
you
came
to
see
your
old
friend
without
delay
i
am
grateful
and
flattered
sally
my
of
course
i
came
to
see
you
do
you
suppose
that
when
meecher
told
me
you
were
sick
i
just
said
that
so
and
went
on
talking
about
the
weather
well
what
do
you
mean
by
it
frightening
everybody
poor
old
darling
do
you
feel
very
bad
one
thousand
individual
mice
are
nibbling
the
base
of
my
spine
and
i
am
conscious
of
a
constant
need
of
cooling
refreshment
but
what
of
that
your
presence
is
a
tonic
tell
me
how
did
our
sally
enjoy
foreign
travel
our
sally
had
the
time
of
her
did
you
visit
england
only
passing
how
did
it
look
asked
faucitt
eagerly
moist
very
it
would
said
faucitt
indulgently
i
confess
that
happy
as
i
have
been
in
this
country
there
are
times
when
i
miss
those
wonderful
london
days
when
a
sort
of
cosy
brown
mist
hangs
over
the
streets
and
the
pavements
ooze
with
a
perspiration
of
mud
and
water
and
you
see
through
the
haze
the
yellow
glow
of
the
bodega
lamps
shining
in
the
distance
like
not
said
faucitt
that
i
specify
the
bodega
to
the
exclusion
of
other
and
equally
worthy
hostelries
i
have
passed
just
as
pleasant
hours
in
rule
and
short
you
missed
something
by
not
lingering
in
england
i
know
i
did
faucitt
shook
his
head
reproachfully
you
are
prejudiced
my
dear
you
would
have
enjoyed
london
if
you
had
had
the
courage
to
brave
its
superficial
gloom
where
did
you
spend
your
holiday
paris
part
of
the
time
and
the
rest
of
the
while
i
was
down
by
the
sea
it
was
glorious
i
do
think
i
would
ever
have
come
back
if
i
had
had
to
but
of
course
i
wanted
to
see
you
all
again
and
i
wanted
to
be
at
the
opening
of
foster
play
meecher
tells
me
you
went
to
one
of
the
i
attended
a
which
i
was
informed
was
a
rehearsal
said
faucitt
severely
there
is
no
rehearsing
oh
dear
was
it
as
bad
as
all
that
the
play
is
good
the
play
i
will
go
further
is
excellent
it
has
fat
but
the
acting
mrs
meecher
said
you
told
her
that
elsa
was
our
worthy
hostess
did
not
misreport
me
miss
doland
has
great
possibilities
she
reminds
me
somewhat
of
matilda
devine
under
whose
banner
i
played
a
season
at
the
old
royalty
in
london
many
years
ago
she
has
the
seeds
of
greatness
in
her
but
she
is
wasted
in
the
present
case
on
an
insignificant
part
there
is
only
one
part
in
the
play
i
allude
to
the
one
murdered
by
miss
mabel
murdered
sally
heart
sank
she
had
been
afraid
of
this
and
it
was
no
satisfaction
to
feel
that
she
had
warned
gerald
is
she
very
terrible
she
has
the
face
of
an
angel
and
the
histrionic
ability
of
that
curious
suet
pudding
which
our
estimable
meecher
is
apt
to
give
us
on
fridays
in
my
professional
career
i
have
seen
many
cases
of
what
i
may
term
the
lady
friend
in
the
role
of
star
but
miss
hobson
eclipses
them
all
i
remember
in
the
year
a
certain
scion
of
the
plutocracy
took
it
into
his
head
to
present
a
female
for
whom
he
had
conceived
an
admiration
in
a
part
which
would
have
taxed
the
resources
of
the
ablest
i
was
engaged
in
her
support
and
at
the
first
rehearsal
i
recollect
saying
to
my
dear
old
friend
arthur
moseby
dead
alas
these
many
years
an
excellent
juvenile
but
like
so
many
good
fellows
cursed
with
a
tendency
to
lift
the
elbow
i
recollect
saying
to
him
dear
boy
i
give
it
two
weeks
was
his
reply
are
an
incurable
optimist
one
consecutive
night
laddie
one
consecutive
night
we
had
i
recall
an
even
upon
it
he
won
we
opened
at
wigan
our
leading
lady
got
the
bird
and
the
show
closed
next
day
i
was
forcibly
reminded
of
this
incident
as
i
watched
miss
hobson
oh
poor
ger
poor
foster
i
do
not
share
your
commiseration
for
that
young
man
said
faucitt
austerely
you
probably
are
almost
a
stranger
to
him
but
he
and
i
have
been
thrown
together
a
good
deal
of
late
a
young
man
upon
whom
mark
my
words
success
if
it
ever
comes
will
have
the
worst
effects
i
dislike
him
sally
he
is
i
think
without
exception
the
most
selfish
and
young
man
of
my
acquaintance
he
reminds
me
very
much
of
old
billy
fothergill
with
whom
i
toured
a
good
deal
in
the
later
eighties
did
i
ever
tell
you
the
story
of
billy
and
the
amateur
who
sally
was
in
no
mood
to
listen
to
the
adventures
of
fothergill
the
old
man
innocent
criticism
of
gerald
had
stabbed
her
deeply
a
momentary
impulse
to
speak
hotly
in
his
defence
died
away
as
she
saw
faucitt
pale
worn
old
face
he
had
meant
no
harm
after
all
how
could
he
know
what
gerald
was
to
her
she
changed
the
conversation
abruptly
have
you
seen
anything
of
fillmore
while
i
been
away
fillmore
why
yes
my
dear
curiously
enough
i
happened
to
run
into
him
on
broadway
only
a
few
days
ago
he
seemed
changed
less
stiff
and
aloof
than
he
had
been
for
some
time
past
i
may
be
wronging
him
but
there
have
been
times
of
late
when
one
might
almost
have
fancied
him
a
trifle
all
that
was
gone
at
our
last
encounter
he
appeared
glad
to
see
me
and
was
most
sally
found
her
composure
restored
her
lecture
on
the
night
of
the
party
had
evidently
she
thought
not
been
wasted
faucitt
however
advanced
another
theory
to
account
for
the
change
in
the
man
of
destiny
i
rather
fancy
he
said
that
the
softening
influence
has
been
the
young
man
what
fillmore
not
engaged
did
he
not
write
and
tell
you
i
suppose
he
was
waiting
to
inform
you
when
you
returned
yes
fillmore
is
betrothed
the
lady
was
with
him
when
we
met
a
miss
winch
in
the
profession
i
understand
he
introduced
me
a
very
charming
and
sensible
young
lady
i
sally
shook
her
head
she
ca
be
fillmore
would
never
have
got
engaged
to
anyone
like
that
was
her
hair
crimson
brown
if
i
recollect
very
loud
i
suppose
and
overdressed
on
the
contrary
neat
and
you
made
a
mistake
said
sally
decidedly
she
ca
have
been
like
that
i
shall
have
to
look
into
this
it
does
seem
hard
that
i
ca
go
away
for
a
few
weeks
without
all
my
friends
taking
to
beds
of
sickness
and
all
my
brothers
getting
ensnared
by
a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
her
complaint
meecher
entered
ushering
in
a
pleasant
little
man
with
spectacles
and
black
bag
the
doctor
to
see
you
meecher
cast
an
appraising
eye
at
the
invalid
as
if
to
detect
symptoms
of
approaching
discoloration
i
been
telling
him
that
what
i
think
you
gotten
is
this
here
new
spanish
influenza
two
more
deaths
there
were
in
the
paper
this
morning
if
you
can
believe
what
you
see
i
wonder
said
the
doctor
if
you
would
mind
going
and
bringing
me
a
small
glass
of
water
why
not
a
large
glass
a
small
glass
just
let
the
tap
run
for
a
few
moments
and
take
care
not
to
spill
any
as
you
come
up
the
stairs
i
always
ask
ladies
like
our
friend
who
has
just
gone
he
added
as
the
door
closed
to
bring
me
a
glass
of
water
it
keeps
them
amused
and
interested
and
gets
them
out
of
the
way
and
they
think
i
am
going
to
do
a
conjuring
trick
with
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
going
to
drink
it
now
let
have
a
look
at
the
examination
did
not
take
long
at
the
end
of
it
the
doctor
seemed
somewhat
chagrined
our
good
friend
diagnosis
was
correct
i
give
a
leg
to
say
it
was
but
it
was
it
is
this
here
new
spanish
influenza
not
a
bad
attack
you
want
to
stay
in
bed
and
keep
warm
and
i
write
you
out
a
prescription
you
ought
to
be
nursed
is
this
young
lady
a
nurse
no
no
merely
of
course
i
a
nurse
said
sally
decidedly
it
is
difficult
is
it
doctor
i
know
nurses
smooth
pillows
i
can
do
that
is
there
anything
else
their
principal
duty
is
to
sit
here
and
prevent
the
excellent
and
garrulous
lady
who
has
just
left
us
from
getting
in
they
must
also
be
able
to
aim
straight
with
a
book
or
an
old
shoe
if
that
small
woolly
dog
i
met
downstairs
tries
to
force
an
entrance
if
you
are
equal
to
these
tasks
i
can
leave
the
case
in
your
hands
with
every
but
sally
my
dear
said
faucitt
concerned
you
must
not
waste
your
time
looking
after
me
you
have
a
thousand
things
to
occupy
there
nothing
i
want
to
do
more
than
help
you
to
get
better
just
go
out
and
send
a
wire
and
then
i
be
right
five
minutes
later
sally
was
in
a
western
union
office
telegraphing
to
gerald
that
she
would
be
unable
to
reach
detroit
in
time
for
the
opening
chapter
vi
first
aid
for
fillmore
it
was
not
till
the
following
friday
that
sally
was
able
to
start
for
detroit
she
arrived
on
the
saturday
morning
and
drove
to
the
hotel
statler
having
ascertained
that
gerald
was
stopping
in
the
hotel
and
having
up
to
his
room
to
tell
him
to
join
her
she
went
into
the
and
ordered
breakfast
she
felt
as
she
waited
for
the
food
to
arrive
the
nursing
of
faucitt
had
left
her
tired
and
she
had
not
slept
well
on
the
train
but
the
real
cause
of
her
depression
was
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
lack
of
enthusiasm
in
gerald
greeting
over
the
telephone
just
now
he
had
spoken
listlessly
as
though
the
fact
of
her
returning
after
all
these
weeks
was
a
matter
of
no
account
and
she
felt
hurt
and
perplexed
a
cup
of
coffee
had
a
stimulating
effect
men
of
course
were
always
like
this
in
the
early
morning
it
would
no
doubt
be
a
very
different
gerald
who
would
presently
bound
into
the
quickened
and
restored
by
a
cold
in
the
meantime
here
was
food
and
she
needed
it
she
was
pouring
out
her
second
cup
of
coffee
when
a
stout
young
man
of
whom
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
as
he
moved
about
that
section
of
the
hotel
lobby
which
was
visible
through
the
open
door
of
the
came
in
and
stood
peering
about
as
though
in
search
of
someone
the
momentary
sight
she
had
had
of
this
young
man
had
interested
sally
she
had
thought
how
extraordinarily
like
he
was
to
her
brother
fillmore
now
she
perceived
that
it
was
fillmore
himself
sally
was
puzzled
what
could
fillmore
be
doing
so
far
west
she
had
supposed
him
to
be
a
permanent
resident
of
new
york
but
of
course
your
man
of
affairs
and
vast
interests
flits
about
all
over
the
place
at
any
rate
here
he
was
and
she
called
him
and
after
he
had
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
in
every
direction
except
the
right
one
for
another
minute
he
saw
her
and
came
over
to
her
table
why
sally
his
manner
she
thought
was
nervous
one
might
almost
have
said
embarrassed
she
attributed
this
to
a
guilty
conscience
presently
he
would
have
to
break
to
her
the
news
that
he
had
become
engaged
to
be
married
without
her
sisterly
sanction
and
no
doubt
he
was
wondering
how
to
begin
what
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
you
were
in
i
got
back
a
week
ago
but
i
been
nursing
poor
old
faucitt
ever
since
then
he
been
ill
poor
old
dear
i
come
here
to
see
foster
play
primrose
way
you
know
is
it
a
success
it
has
opened
do
be
silly
fill
do
pull
yourself
together
it
opened
last
no
it
did
have
you
heard
they
closed
all
the
theatres
because
of
this
infernal
spanish
influenza
nothing
has
been
playing
this
week
you
must
have
seen
it
in
the
i
have
had
time
to
read
the
papers
oh
fill
what
an
awful
shame
yes
it
pretty
tough
makes
the
company
all
on
edge
i
had
the
darndest
time
i
can
tell
why
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
it
fillmore
coughed
i
er
oh
i
did
tell
you
that
i
sort
of
er
mixed
up
in
the
show
cracknell
you
remember
he
was
at
college
with
me
suggested
that
i
should
come
down
and
look
at
it
should
wonder
if
he
wants
me
to
put
money
into
it
and
so
i
thought
he
had
all
the
money
in
the
yes
he
has
a
lot
but
these
fellows
like
to
let
a
pal
in
on
a
good
is
it
a
good
thing
the
play
that
what
faucitt
said
but
mabel
hobson
fillmore
ample
face
registered
emotion
she
an
awful
woman
sally
she
ca
act
and
she
throws
her
weight
about
all
the
time
the
other
day
there
was
a
fuss
about
a
how
do
you
mean
a
fuss
about
a
one
of
the
props
you
know
it
got
mislaid
i
certain
it
was
my
fault
how
could
it
have
been
your
fault
asked
sally
wonderingly
love
seemed
to
have
the
worst
effects
on
fillmore
mentality
well
er
you
know
how
it
is
angry
woman
blames
the
first
person
she
sees
this
fillmore
voice
trailed
off
into
pained
silence
mr
faucitt
said
elsa
doland
was
oh
she
all
right
said
fillmore
indifferently
but
his
face
brightened
and
animation
crept
into
his
voice
but
the
girl
you
want
to
watch
is
miss
winch
gladys
winch
she
plays
the
maid
she
only
in
the
first
act
and
has
much
to
say
except
you
ring
madam
and
things
like
that
but
it
the
way
she
says
sally
that
girl
a
genius
the
greatest
character
actress
in
a
dozen
years
you
mark
my
words
in
a
darned
little
while
you
see
her
name
up
on
broadway
in
electric
light
personality
ask
me
charm
she
wrote
the
words
and
music
looks
all
right
all
right
i
know
all
about
it
fill
and
will
you
kindly
inform
me
how
you
dared
to
get
engaged
without
consulting
me
fillmore
blushed
richly
oh
do
you
know
yes
faucitt
told
well
well
well
i
only
human
argued
fillmore
i
call
that
a
very
handsome
admission
you
got
quite
modest
he
had
certainly
changed
for
the
better
since
their
last
meeting
it
was
as
if
someone
had
punctured
him
and
let
out
all
the
pomposity
if
this
was
due
as
faucitt
had
suggested
to
the
influence
of
miss
winch
sally
felt
that
she
could
not
but
approve
of
the
romance
i
introduce
you
sometime
said
fillmore
i
want
to
meet
her
very
i
have
to
be
going
now
i
got
to
see
bunbury
i
thought
he
might
be
in
who
bunbury
the
producer
i
suppose
he
is
breakfasting
in
his
room
i
better
go
you
are
busy
are
you
little
marvel
it
lucky
they
got
you
to
look
after
fillmore
retired
and
sally
settled
down
to
wait
for
gerald
no
longer
hurt
by
his
manner
over
the
telephone
poor
gerald
no
wonder
he
had
seemed
upset
a
few
minutes
later
he
came
in
oh
jerry
darling
said
sally
as
he
reached
the
table
i
so
sorry
i
just
been
hearing
about
gerald
sat
down
his
appearance
fulfilled
the
promise
of
his
voice
over
the
telephone
a
sort
of
nervous
dullness
wrapped
him
about
like
a
garment
it
just
my
luck
he
said
gloomily
it
the
kind
of
thing
that
could
happen
to
anyone
but
me
damned
fools
where
the
sense
in
shutting
the
theatres
even
if
there
is
influenza
about
they
let
people
jam
against
one
another
all
day
in
the
stores
if
that
does
hurt
them
why
should
it
hurt
them
to
go
to
theatres
besides
it
all
infernal
nonsense
about
this
thing
i
do
believe
there
is
such
a
thing
as
spanish
influenza
people
get
colds
in
their
heads
and
think
dying
it
all
a
fake
i
do
think
it
that
said
sally
poor
faucitt
had
it
quite
badly
that
why
i
could
come
gerald
did
not
seem
interested
either
by
the
news
of
illness
or
by
the
fact
that
sally
after
delay
had
at
last
arrived
he
dug
a
spoon
sombrely
into
his
we
been
hanging
about
here
day
after
day
getting
bored
to
death
all
the
time
the
company
going
all
to
pieces
they
sick
of
rehearsing
and
rehearsing
when
nobody
knows
if
we
ever
open
they
were
all
keyed
up
a
week
ago
and
they
been
sagging
ever
since
it
will
ruin
the
play
of
course
my
first
chance
just
chucked
sally
was
listening
with
a
growing
feeling
of
desolation
she
tried
to
be
fair
to
remember
that
he
had
had
a
terrible
disappointment
and
was
under
a
great
strain
and
yet
it
was
unfortunate
that
was
a
thing
she
particularly
disliked
in
a
man
her
vanity
too
was
hurt
it
was
obvious
that
her
arrival
so
far
from
acting
as
a
magic
restorative
had
effected
nothing
she
could
not
help
remembering
though
it
made
her
feel
disloyal
what
faucitt
had
said
about
gerald
she
had
never
noticed
before
that
he
was
remarkably
but
he
was
thrusting
the
fact
upon
her
attention
now
that
hobson
woman
is
beginning
to
make
trouble
went
on
gerald
prodding
in
a
despairing
sort
of
way
at
scrambled
eggs
she
ought
never
to
have
had
the
part
never
she
ca
handle
it
elsa
doland
could
play
it
a
thousand
times
better
i
wrote
elsa
in
a
few
lines
the
other
day
and
the
hobson
woman
went
right
up
in
the
air
you
do
know
what
a
star
is
till
you
seen
one
of
these
promoted
from
the
follies
trying
to
be
one
it
took
me
an
hour
to
talk
her
round
and
keep
her
from
throwing
up
her
why
not
let
her
throw
up
her
part
for
heaven
sake
talk
sense
said
gerald
querulously
do
you
suppose
that
man
cracknell
would
keep
the
play
on
if
she
was
in
it
he
would
close
the
show
in
a
second
and
where
would
i
be
then
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
this
is
a
big
chance
for
me
i
look
a
fool
throwing
it
i
see
said
sally
shortly
she
had
never
felt
so
wretched
in
her
life
foreign
travel
she
decided
was
a
mistake
it
might
be
pleasant
and
broadening
to
the
mind
but
it
seemed
to
put
you
so
out
of
touch
with
people
when
you
got
back
she
analysed
her
sensations
and
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
what
she
was
resenting
was
the
fact
that
gerald
was
trying
to
get
the
advantages
of
two
attitudes
simultaneously
a
man
in
trouble
may
either
be
the
captain
of
his
soul
and
superior
to
pity
or
he
may
be
a
broken
thing
for
a
woman
to
pet
and
comfort
gerald
it
seemed
to
her
was
advertising
himself
as
an
object
for
her
commiseration
and
at
the
same
time
raising
a
barrier
against
it
he
appeared
to
demand
her
sympathy
while
holding
himself
aloof
from
it
she
had
the
uncomfortable
sensation
of
feeling
herself
shut
out
and
useless
by
the
way
said
gerald
there
one
thing
i
have
to
keep
her
jollying
along
all
the
time
so
for
goodness
sake
do
go
letting
it
out
that
we
sally
chin
went
up
with
a
jerk
this
was
too
much
if
you
find
it
a
handicap
being
engaged
to
me
do
be
gerald
took
refuge
in
pathos
good
god
it
tough
here
am
i
worried
to
death
and
you
before
he
could
finish
the
sentence
sally
mood
had
undergone
one
of
those
swift
changes
which
sometimes
made
her
feel
that
she
must
be
lacking
in
character
a
simple
comforting
thought
had
come
to
her
altering
her
entire
outlook
she
had
come
off
the
train
tired
and
gritty
and
what
seemed
the
general
of
the
world
was
entirely
due
she
decided
to
the
fact
that
she
had
not
had
a
bath
and
that
her
hair
was
all
anyhow
she
felt
suddenly
tranquil
if
it
was
merely
her
grubby
and
dishevelled
condition
that
made
gerald
seem
to
her
so
different
all
was
well
she
put
her
hand
on
his
with
a
quick
gesture
of
penitence
i
so
sorry
she
said
i
been
a
brute
but
i
do
sympathize
i
had
an
awful
time
mumbled
gerald
i
know
i
know
but
you
never
told
me
you
were
glad
to
see
of
course
i
glad
to
see
why
did
you
say
so
then
you
poor
fish
and
why
did
you
ask
me
if
i
had
enjoyed
myself
in
europe
did
you
enjoy
yourself
yes
except
that
i
missed
you
so
much
there
now
we
can
consider
my
lecture
on
foreign
travel
finished
and
you
can
go
on
telling
me
your
gerald
accepted
the
invitation
he
spoke
at
considerable
length
though
with
little
variety
it
appeared
definitely
established
in
his
mind
that
providence
had
invented
spanish
influenza
purely
with
a
view
to
wrecking
his
future
but
now
he
seemed
less
aloof
more
open
to
sympathy
the
brief
thunderstorm
had
cleared
the
air
sally
lost
that
sense
of
detachment
and
exclusion
which
had
weighed
upon
her
well
said
gerald
at
length
looking
at
his
watch
i
suppose
i
had
better
be
rehearsal
yes
confound
it
it
the
only
way
of
getting
through
the
day
are
you
coming
along
i
come
directly
i
unpacked
and
tidied
myself
see
you
at
the
theatre
sally
went
out
and
rang
for
the
lift
to
take
her
up
to
her
room
the
rehearsal
had
started
when
she
reached
the
theatre
as
she
entered
the
dark
auditorium
voices
came
to
her
with
that
thin
and
reedy
effect
which
is
produced
by
people
talking
in
an
empty
building
she
sat
down
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
as
her
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
gloom
was
able
to
see
gerald
sitting
in
the
front
row
beside
a
man
with
a
bald
head
fringed
with
orange
hair
whom
she
took
correctly
to
be
bunbury
the
producer
dotted
about
the
house
in
ones
and
twos
were
members
of
the
company
whose
presence
was
not
required
in
the
first
act
on
the
stage
elsa
doland
looking
very
attractive
was
playing
a
scene
with
a
man
in
a
bowler
hat
she
was
speaking
a
line
as
sally
came
in
why
what
do
you
mean
father
was
the
one
surprising
reply
long
speech
ending
in
me
in
the
library
and
exit
said
the
man
in
the
bowler
hat
starting
to
do
so
for
the
first
time
sally
became
aware
of
the
atmosphere
of
nerves
bunbury
who
seemed
to
be
a
man
of
temperament
picked
up
his
which
was
leaning
against
the
next
seat
and
flung
it
with
some
violence
across
the
house
for
god
sake
said
bunbury
now
what
inquired
the
bowler
hat
interested
pausing
hallway
across
the
stage
do
speak
the
lines
teddy
exclaimed
gerald
do
skip
them
in
that
sloppy
you
do
want
me
to
go
over
the
whole
thing
asked
the
bowler
hat
amazed
yes
not
the
whole
damn
thing
queried
the
bowler
hat
fighting
with
incredulity
this
is
a
rehearsal
snapped
bunbury
if
we
are
not
going
to
do
it
properly
what
the
use
of
doing
it
at
all
this
seemed
to
strike
the
erring
teddy
if
not
as
reasonable
at
any
rate
as
one
way
of
looking
at
it
he
delivered
the
speech
in
an
injured
tone
and
shuffled
off
the
atmosphere
of
tenseness
was
unmistakable
now
sally
could
feel
it
the
world
of
the
theatre
is
simply
a
large
nursery
and
its
inhabitants
children
who
readily
become
fretful
if
anything
goes
wrong
the
waiting
and
the
uncertainty
the
loafing
about
in
strange
hotels
in
a
strange
city
the
dreary
rehearsing
of
lines
which
had
been
polished
to
the
last
syllable
more
than
a
week
ago
these
things
had
sapped
the
nerve
of
the
primrose
way
company
and
demoralization
had
set
in
it
would
require
only
a
trifle
to
produce
an
explosion
elsa
doland
now
moved
to
the
door
pressed
a
bell
and
taking
a
magazine
from
the
table
sat
down
in
a
chair
near
the
footlights
a
moment
later
in
answer
to
the
ring
a
young
woman
entered
to
be
greeted
instantly
by
an
impassioned
bellow
from
bunbury
miss
winch
the
new
arrival
stopped
and
looked
out
over
the
footlights
not
in
the
pained
manner
of
the
man
in
the
bowler
hat
but
with
the
sort
of
genial
indulgence
of
one
who
has
come
to
a
juvenile
party
to
amuse
the
children
she
was
a
square
wholesome
looking
girl
with
a
serious
face
the
gravity
of
which
was
contradicted
by
the
faint
smile
that
seemed
to
lurk
about
the
corner
of
her
mouth
she
was
certainly
not
pretty
and
sally
watching
her
with
keen
interest
was
surprised
that
fillmore
had
had
the
sense
to
disregard
surface
homeliness
and
recognize
her
charm
deep
down
in
fillmore
sally
decided
there
must
lurk
an
unsuspected
vein
of
intelligence
hello
said
miss
winch
amiably
bunbury
seemed
profoundly
moved
miss
winch
did
i
or
did
i
not
ask
you
to
refrain
from
chewing
gum
during
rehearsal
that
right
so
you
did
admitted
miss
winch
chummily
then
why
are
you
doing
it
fillmore
fiancée
revolved
the
criticized
refreshment
about
her
tongue
for
a
moment
before
replying
bit
o
business
she
announced
at
length
what
do
you
mean
a
bit
of
business
character
stuff
explained
miss
winch
in
her
pleasant
drawling
voice
thought
it
out
myself
maids
chew
gum
you
bunbury
ruffled
his
orange
hair
in
an
manner
with
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
have
you
ever
seen
a
maid
he
asked
despairingly
yes
sir
and
they
chew
i
mean
a
in
a
smart
house
moaned
bunbury
do
you
imagine
for
a
moment
that
in
a
house
such
as
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
would
be
allowed
to
come
into
the
champing
that
disgusting
beastly
stuff
miss
winch
considered
the
point
maybe
you
she
brightened
listen
great
idea
foster
can
write
in
a
line
for
elsa
calling
me
down
and
another
giving
me
a
good
and
then
another
for
elsa
saying
something
else
and
then
something
really
funny
for
me
and
so
on
we
can
work
it
up
into
a
big
comic
scene
five
or
six
minutes
all
this
ingenious
suggestion
had
the
effect
of
depriving
the
producer
momentarily
of
speech
and
while
he
was
struggling
for
utterance
there
dashed
out
from
the
wings
a
gorgeous
being
in
blue
velvet
and
a
hat
of
such
unimpeachable
smartness
that
sally
ached
at
the
sight
of
it
with
a
spasm
of
pure
envy
say
miss
mabel
hobson
had
practically
every
personal
advantage
which
nature
can
bestow
with
the
exception
of
a
musical
voice
her
figure
was
perfect
her
face
beautiful
and
her
hair
a
mass
of
spun
gold
but
her
voice
in
moments
of
emotion
was
the
voice
of
a
peacock
say
listen
to
me
for
just
one
moment
bunbury
recovered
from
his
trance
miss
hobson
please
yes
that
all
very
well
you
are
interrupting
the
you
bet
your
sorrowful
existence
i
interrupting
the
rehearsal
agreed
miss
hobson
with
emphasis
and
if
you
want
to
make
a
little
easy
money
you
go
and
bet
somebody
ten
seeds
that
i
going
to
interrupt
it
again
every
time
there
any
talk
of
writing
up
any
darned
part
in
the
show
except
mine
write
up
other
people
parts
not
while
i
have
my
strength
a
young
man
with
hair
who
had
entered
from
the
wings
in
close
attendance
on
the
injured
lady
attempted
to
calm
the
storm
now
sweetie
oh
can
it
reggie
said
miss
hobson
curtly
cracknell
obediently
canned
it
he
was
not
one
of
your
brutal
he
subsided
into
the
recesses
of
a
high
collar
and
began
to
chew
the
knob
of
his
stick
i
the
star
resumed
miss
hobson
vehemently
and
if
you
think
anybody
else
part
going
to
be
written
up
well
pardon
me
while
i
choke
with
laughter
if
so
much
as
a
syllable
is
written
into
part
i
walk
straight
out
on
my
two
feet
you
wo
see
me
go
i
be
so
bunbury
sprang
to
his
feet
and
waved
his
hands
for
heaven
sake
are
we
rehearsing
or
is
this
a
debating
society
miss
hobson
nothing
is
going
to
be
written
into
anybody
part
now
are
you
satisfied
she
said
oh
never
mind
observed
miss
winch
equably
it
was
only
a
random
thought
working
for
the
good
of
the
show
all
the
time
that
now
sweetie
pleaded
cracknell
emerging
from
the
collar
like
a
tortoise
miss
hobson
reluctantly
allowed
herself
to
be
reassured
oh
well
that
all
right
then
but
do
forget
i
know
how
to
look
after
myself
she
said
stating
a
fact
which
was
abundantly
obvious
to
all
who
had
had
the
privilege
of
listening
to
her
any
raw
work
and
out
i
walk
so
quick
it
make
you
she
retired
followed
by
cracknell
and
the
wings
swallowed
her
up
shall
i
say
my
big
speech
now
inquired
miss
winch
over
the
footlights
yes
yes
get
on
with
the
rehearsal
we
wasted
half
the
did
you
ring
madam
said
miss
winch
to
elsa
who
had
been
reading
her
magazine
placidly
through
the
late
scene
the
rehearsal
proceeded
and
sally
watched
it
with
a
sinking
heart
it
was
all
wrong
novice
as
she
was
in
things
theatrical
she
could
see
that
there
was
no
doubt
that
miss
hobson
was
superbly
beautiful
and
would
have
shed
lustre
on
any
part
which
involved
the
minimum
of
words
and
the
maximum
of
clothes
but
in
the
pivotal
role
of
a
serious
play
her
very
physical
attributes
only
served
to
emphasize
and
point
her
hopeless
incapacity
sally
remembered
faucitt
story
of
the
lady
who
got
the
bird
at
wigan
she
did
not
see
how
history
could
fail
to
repeat
itself
the
theatrical
public
of
america
will
endure
much
from
youth
and
beauty
but
there
is
a
limit
a
shrill
passionate
cry
from
the
front
row
and
bunbury
was
on
his
feet
again
sally
could
not
help
wondering
whether
things
were
going
particularly
wrong
or
whether
this
was
one
of
ordinary
mornings
miss
hobson
the
action
of
the
drama
had
just
brought
that
emotional
lady
on
left
centre
and
had
taken
her
across
to
the
desk
which
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
stage
the
desk
was
an
important
feature
of
the
play
for
it
symbolized
the
absorption
in
business
which
exhibited
by
her
husband
was
rapidly
breaking
miss
hobson
heart
he
loved
his
desk
better
than
his
young
wife
that
was
what
it
amounted
to
and
no
wife
can
stand
that
sort
of
thing
oh
gee
said
miss
hobson
ceasing
to
be
the
distressed
wife
and
becoming
the
offended
star
what
it
this
time
i
suggested
at
the
last
rehearsal
and
at
the
rehearsal
before
and
the
rehearsal
before
that
that
on
that
line
you
should
pick
up
the
and
toy
negligently
with
it
you
did
it
yesterday
and
you
forgotten
it
my
god
cried
miss
hobson
wounded
to
the
quick
if
this
do
beat
everything
how
the
heck
can
i
toy
negligently
with
a
when
there
no
for
me
to
toy
negligently
with
the
is
on
the
it
not
on
the
no
no
and
it
no
good
picking
on
me
i
the
star
not
the
assistant
stage
manager
if
you
going
to
pick
on
anybody
pick
on
the
advice
appeared
to
strike
bunbury
as
good
he
threw
back
his
head
and
bayed
like
a
bloodhound
there
was
a
momentary
pause
and
then
from
the
wings
on
the
prompt
side
there
shambled
out
a
stout
and
shrinking
figure
in
whose
hand
was
a
script
of
the
play
and
on
whose
face
lit
up
by
the
footlights
there
shone
a
look
of
apprehension
it
was
fillmore
the
man
of
destiny
alas
poor
fillmore
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
with
the
lightning
of
bunbury
wrath
playing
about
his
defenceless
head
and
sally
recovering
from
her
first
astonishment
sent
a
wave
of
sisterly
commiseration
floating
across
the
theatre
to
him
she
did
not
often
pity
fillmore
his
was
a
nature
which
in
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
had
a
tendency
to
grow
a
trifle
lush
and
such
of
the
minor
ills
of
life
as
had
afflicted
him
during
the
past
three
years
had
she
considered
been
wholesome
and
educative
and
a
matter
not
for
concern
but
for
congratulation
unmoved
she
had
watched
him
through
that
lean
period
lunching
on
coffee
and
buckwheat
cakes
and
curbing
from
motives
of
economy
a
somewhat
florid
taste
in
dress
but
this
was
different
this
was
tragedy
somehow
or
other
blasting
disaster
must
have
smitten
the
fillmore
and
he
was
back
where
he
had
started
his
presence
here
this
morning
could
mean
nothing
else
she
recalled
his
words
at
the
about
financing
the
play
how
like
fillmore
to
try
to
save
his
face
for
the
moment
with
an
outrageous
bluff
though
well
aware
that
he
would
have
to
reveal
the
truth
sooner
or
later
she
realized
how
he
must
have
felt
when
he
had
seen
her
at
the
hotel
yes
she
was
sorry
for
fillmore
and
as
she
listened
to
the
fervent
eloquence
of
bunbury
she
perceived
that
she
had
every
reason
to
be
fillmore
was
having
a
bad
time
one
of
the
chief
articles
of
faith
in
the
creed
of
all
theatrical
producers
is
that
if
anything
goes
wrong
it
must
be
the
fault
of
the
assistant
stage
manager
and
bunbury
was
evidently
orthodox
in
his
views
he
was
showing
oratorical
gifts
of
no
mean
order
the
seemed
to
inspire
him
gradually
sally
began
to
get
the
feeling
that
this
harmless
necessary
was
the
source
from
which
sprang
most
if
not
all
of
the
trouble
in
the
world
it
had
disappeared
before
now
it
had
disappeared
again
could
bunbury
go
on
struggling
in
a
universe
where
this
sort
of
thing
happened
he
seemed
to
doubt
it
being
a
american
man
he
would
try
hard
but
it
was
a
hundred
to
one
shot
that
he
would
get
through
he
had
asked
for
a
there
was
no
why
was
there
no
where
was
the
anyway
i
assure
you
bunbury
bleated
the
unhappy
fillmore
obsequiously
i
placed
it
with
the
rest
of
the
properties
after
the
last
you
could
have
i
assure
you
i
and
it
walked
away
i
suppose
said
miss
hobson
with
cold
scorn
pausing
in
the
operation
of
brightening
up
her
lower
lip
with
a
a
calm
clear
voice
spoke
it
was
taken
away
said
the
calm
clear
voice
miss
winch
had
added
herself
to
the
symposium
she
stood
beside
fillmore
chewing
placidly
it
took
more
than
raised
voices
and
gesticulating
hands
to
disturb
miss
winch
miss
hobson
took
it
she
went
on
in
her
cosy
drawling
voice
i
saw
sensation
in
court
the
prisoner
who
seemed
to
feel
his
position
deeply
cast
a
glance
full
of
gratitude
at
his
advocate
bunbury
in
his
capacity
of
prosecuting
attorney
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
in
some
embarrassment
for
he
was
regretting
now
that
he
had
made
such
a
fuss
miss
hobson
thus
assailed
by
an
underling
spun
round
and
dropped
the
which
was
neatly
retrieved
by
the
assiduous
cracknell
cracknell
had
his
limitations
but
he
was
rather
good
at
picking
up
what
that
i
took
it
i
never
did
anything
of
the
miss
hobson
took
it
after
the
rehearsal
yesterday
drawled
gladys
winch
addressing
the
world
in
general
and
threw
it
negligently
at
the
theatre
miss
hobson
seemed
taken
aback
her
composure
was
not
restored
by
bunbury
next
remark
the
producer
like
his
company
had
been
feeling
the
strain
of
the
past
few
days
and
though
as
a
rule
he
avoided
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
clash
with
the
temperamental
star
this
matter
of
the
missing
had
bitten
so
deeply
into
his
soul
that
he
felt
compelled
to
speak
his
mind
in
future
miss
hobson
i
should
be
glad
if
when
you
wish
to
throw
anything
at
the
cat
you
would
not
select
a
missile
from
the
property
box
good
heavens
he
cried
stung
by
the
way
fate
was
maltreating
him
i
have
never
experienced
anything
like
this
before
i
have
been
producing
plays
all
my
life
and
this
is
the
first
time
this
has
happened
i
have
produced
nazimova
nazimova
never
threw
at
well
i
hate
cats
said
miss
hobson
as
though
that
settled
it
i
murmured
miss
winch
love
little
pussy
her
fur
is
so
warm
and
if
i
do
hurt
her
she
do
me
no
oh
my
heavens
shouted
gerald
foster
bounding
from
his
seat
and
for
the
first
time
taking
a
share
in
the
debate
are
we
going
to
spend
the
whole
day
arguing
about
cats
and
for
goodness
sake
clear
the
stage
and
stop
wasting
miss
hobson
chose
to
regard
this
intervention
as
an
affront
do
shout
at
me
foster
i
was
shouting
at
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
me
lower
your
he
ca
observed
miss
winch
he
a
nazimova
never
began
bunbury
miss
hobson
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
her
theme
by
reminiscences
of
nazimova
she
had
not
finished
dealing
with
gerald
in
the
shows
i
been
in
she
said
mordantly
the
author
allowed
to
go
about
the
place
getting
fresh
with
the
leading
lady
in
the
shows
i
been
in
the
author
sat
at
the
back
and
spoke
when
he
was
spoken
to
in
the
shows
i
been
in
sally
was
tingling
all
over
this
reminded
her
of
the
on
the
roville
sands
she
wanted
to
be
in
it
and
only
the
recognition
that
it
was
a
private
fight
and
that
she
would
be
intruding
kept
her
silent
the
lure
of
the
fray
however
was
too
strong
for
her
wholly
to
resist
it
almost
unconsciously
she
had
risen
from
her
place
and
drifted
down
the
aisle
so
as
to
be
nearer
the
centre
of
things
she
was
now
standing
in
the
lighted
space
by
the
and
her
presence
attracted
the
roving
attention
of
miss
hobson
who
having
concluded
her
remarks
on
authors
and
their
legitimate
sphere
of
activity
was
looking
about
for
some
other
object
of
attack
who
the
devil
inquired
miss
hobson
is
that
sally
found
herself
an
object
of
universal
scrutiny
and
wished
that
she
had
remained
in
the
obscurity
of
the
back
rows
i
am
nicholas
sister
was
the
best
method
of
identification
that
she
could
find
who
nicholas
fillmore
timidly
admitted
that
he
was
nicholas
he
did
it
in
the
manner
of
one
in
the
dock
pleading
guilty
to
a
major
charge
and
at
least
half
of
those
present
seemed
surprised
to
them
till
now
fillmore
had
been
a
nameless
thing
answering
to
the
shout
of
hi
miss
hobson
received
the
information
with
a
laugh
of
such
exceeding
bitterness
that
strong
men
blanched
and
cracknell
started
so
convulsively
that
he
nearly
jerked
his
collar
off
its
stud
now
sweetie
urged
cracknell
miss
hobson
said
that
cracknell
gave
her
a
pain
in
the
gizzard
she
recommended
his
fading
away
and
he
did
so
into
his
collar
he
seemed
to
feel
that
once
well
inside
his
collar
he
was
home
and
safe
from
attack
i
through
announced
miss
hobson
it
appeared
that
sally
presence
had
in
some
mysterious
fashion
fulfilled
the
function
of
the
last
straw
this
is
the
show
i
was
ever
in
i
can
stand
for
a
whole
lot
but
when
it
comes
to
the
assistant
stage
manager
being
allowed
to
fill
the
theatre
with
his
sisters
and
his
cousins
and
his
aunts
it
time
to
but
sweetie
pleaded
cracknell
coming
to
the
surface
oh
go
and
choke
yourself
said
miss
hobson
crisply
and
swinging
round
like
a
blue
panther
she
strode
off
a
door
banged
and
the
sound
of
it
seemed
to
restore
cracknell
power
of
movement
he
too
shot
up
stage
and
disappeared
hello
sally
said
elsa
doland
looking
up
from
her
magazine
the
battle
raging
all
round
her
had
failed
to
disturb
her
detachment
when
did
you
get
back
sally
trotted
up
the
steps
which
had
been
propped
against
the
stage
to
form
a
bridge
over
the
orchestra
pit
hello
the
late
debaters
had
split
into
groups
bunbury
and
gerald
were
pacing
up
and
down
the
central
aisle
talking
earnestly
fillmore
had
subsided
into
a
chair
do
you
know
gladys
winch
asked
elsa
sally
shook
hands
with
the
placid
lodestar
of
her
brother
affections
miss
winch
on
closer
inspection
proved
to
have
deep
grey
eyes
and
freckles
sally
liking
for
her
increased
thank
you
for
saving
fillmore
from
the
wolves
she
said
they
would
have
torn
him
in
pieces
but
for
oh
i
do
know
said
miss
winch
it
was
oh
well
i
think
said
sally
i
go
and
have
a
talk
with
fillmore
he
looks
as
though
he
wanted
she
made
her
way
to
that
picturesque
ruin
fillmore
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
thought
it
was
loaded
a
wild
startled
expression
had
settled
itself
upon
his
face
and
he
was
breathing
heavily
cheer
up
said
sally
fillmore
jumped
like
a
stricken
jelly
tell
me
all
said
sally
sitting
down
beside
him
i
leave
you
a
gentleman
of
large
and
independent
means
and
i
come
back
and
find
you
one
of
the
again
how
did
it
all
happen
sally
said
fillmore
i
will
be
frank
with
you
can
you
lend
me
ten
dollars
i
do
see
how
you
make
that
out
an
answer
to
my
question
but
here
you
fillmore
pocketed
the
bill
i
let
you
have
it
back
next
week
i
want
to
take
miss
winch
out
to
if
that
what
you
want
it
for
do
look
on
it
as
a
loan
take
it
as
a
gift
with
my
blessing
thrown
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
miss
winch
who
the
cares
of
rehearsal
being
temporarily
suspended
was
practising
with
an
umbrella
at
the
other
side
of
the
stage
however
did
you
have
the
sense
to
fall
in
love
with
her
fill
do
you
like
her
asked
fillmore
brightening
i
love
i
knew
you
would
she
just
the
right
girl
for
me
is
she
she
certainly
so
so
and
she
got
brains
enough
for
two
which
is
the
exact
quantity
the
girl
who
marries
you
will
fillmore
drew
himself
up
with
as
much
hauteur
as
a
stout
man
sitting
in
a
low
chair
can
achieve
some
day
i
will
make
you
believe
in
me
less
of
the
merchant
prince
my
lad
said
sally
firmly
you
just
confine
yourself
to
explaining
how
you
got
this
way
instead
of
taking
up
my
valuable
time
telling
me
what
you
mean
to
do
in
the
future
lost
all
your
money
i
have
suffered
certain
reverses
said
fillmore
with
dignity
which
have
left
me
temporarily
yes
every
bean
he
concluded
simply
how
well
fillmore
hesitated
i
had
bad
luck
you
know
first
i
bought
consolidated
rails
for
the
rise
and
they
fell
so
that
went
yes
and
then
i
bought
russian
roubles
for
the
fall
and
they
rose
so
that
went
good
gracious
why
i
heard
all
this
who
told
you
no
i
remember
now
it
just
that
you
remind
me
of
a
man
i
met
at
roville
he
was
telling
me
the
story
of
his
life
and
how
he
had
made
a
hash
of
everything
well
that
took
all
you
had
i
suppose
not
quite
i
had
a
few
thousand
left
and
i
went
into
a
deal
that
really
did
look
and
that
went
wrong
it
was
my
fault
said
fillmore
querulously
it
was
just
my
poisonous
luck
a
man
i
knew
got
me
to
join
a
syndicate
which
had
bought
up
a
lot
of
whisky
the
idea
was
to
ship
it
into
chicago
in
we
should
have
cleaned
up
big
only
a
mutt
of
a
detective
took
it
into
his
darned
head
to
go
fooling
about
with
a
crowbar
officious
ass
it
was
as
if
the
barrels
were
labelled
as
plainly
as
they
could
be
said
fillmore
with
honest
indignation
he
shuddered
i
nearly
got
but
that
went
wrong
well
that
something
to
be
thankful
for
stripes
would
suit
your
sally
gave
his
arm
a
squeeze
she
was
very
fond
of
fillmore
though
for
the
good
of
his
soul
she
generally
concealed
her
affection
beneath
a
manner
which
he
had
once
compared
not
without
some
reason
to
that
of
a
governess
who
had
afflicted
their
mutual
childhood
never
mind
you
poor
martyr
things
are
sure
to
come
right
we
shall
see
you
a
millionaire
some
day
and
oh
heavens
brother
fillmore
what
a
bore
you
be
when
you
are
i
can
just
see
you
being
interviewed
and
giving
hints
to
young
men
on
how
to
make
good
nicholas
attributes
his
success
to
sheer
hard
work
he
can
lay
his
hand
on
his
bulging
waistcoat
and
say
that
he
has
never
once
indulged
in
those
rash
speculations
where
you
buy
for
the
rise
and
watch
things
fall
and
then
rush
out
and
buy
for
the
fall
and
watch
rise
fill
i
tell
you
what
i
do
they
all
say
it
the
first
bit
of
money
that
counts
in
building
a
vast
fortune
i
lend
you
some
of
you
will
sally
i
always
said
you
were
an
i
never
heard
you
you
ought
to
mumble
will
you
lend
me
twenty
thousand
dollars
sally
patted
his
hand
soothingly
come
slowly
down
to
earth
she
said
two
hundred
was
the
sum
i
had
in
i
want
twenty
you
better
rob
a
bank
any
policeman
will
direct
you
to
a
good
i
tell
you
why
i
want
twenty
you
might
just
mention
if
i
had
twenty
thousand
i
buy
this
production
from
cracknell
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
to
tell
us
that
the
hobson
woman
has
quit
and
if
she
really
has
you
take
it
from
me
that
he
will
close
the
show
and
even
if
he
manages
to
jolly
her
along
this
time
and
she
comes
back
going
to
happen
sooner
or
later
it
a
shame
to
let
a
show
like
this
close
i
believe
in
it
sally
it
a
darn
good
play
with
elsa
doland
in
the
big
part
it
could
sally
started
her
money
was
too
recent
for
her
to
have
grown
fully
accustomed
to
it
and
she
had
never
realized
that
she
was
in
a
position
to
wave
a
wand
and
make
things
happen
on
any
big
scale
the
financing
of
a
theatrical
production
had
always
been
to
her
something
mysterious
and
out
of
the
reach
of
ordinary
persons
like
herself
fillmore
that
spacious
thinker
had
brought
it
into
the
sphere
of
the
possible
he
sell
for
less
than
that
of
course
but
one
would
need
a
bit
in
hand
you
have
to
face
a
loss
on
the
road
before
coming
into
new
york
i
give
you
ten
per
cent
on
your
money
sally
found
herself
wavering
the
prudent
side
of
her
nature
which
hitherto
had
steered
her
safely
through
most
of
life
rapids
seemed
oddly
dormant
she
was
aware
that
on
past
performances
fillmore
was
decidedly
not
the
man
to
be
allowed
control
of
little
fortune
but
somehow
the
thought
did
not
seem
to
grip
her
he
had
touched
her
imagination
it
a
sally
prudent
side
stirred
in
its
sleep
fillmore
had
chosen
an
unfortunate
expression
to
the
novice
in
finance
the
word
had
repellent
associations
if
there
was
one
thing
in
which
sally
had
proposed
not
to
invest
her
legacy
it
was
a
what
she
had
had
in
view
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
been
one
of
those
little
fancy
shops
which
are
called
ye
blue
bird
or
ye
corner
shoppe
or
something
like
that
where
you
sell
exotic
to
the
wealthy
at
extortionate
prices
she
knew
two
girls
who
were
doing
splendidly
in
that
line
as
fillmore
spoke
those
words
ye
corner
shoppe
suddenly
looked
very
good
to
her
at
this
moment
however
two
things
happened
gerald
and
bunbury
in
the
course
of
their
perambulations
came
into
the
glow
of
the
footlights
and
she
was
able
to
see
gerald
face
and
at
the
same
time
reginald
cracknell
hurried
on
to
the
stage
his
whole
demeanour
that
of
the
bearer
of
evil
tidings
the
sight
of
gerald
face
annihilated
sally
prudence
at
a
single
stroke
ye
corner
shoppe
which
a
moment
before
had
been
shining
brightly
before
her
mental
eye
flickered
and
melted
out
the
whole
issue
became
clear
and
simple
gerald
was
miserable
and
she
had
it
in
her
power
to
make
him
happy
he
was
sullenly
awaiting
disaster
and
she
with
a
word
could
avert
it
she
wondered
that
she
had
ever
hesitated
all
right
she
said
simply
fillmore
quivered
from
head
to
foot
a
powerful
electric
shock
could
not
have
produced
a
stronger
convulsion
he
knew
sally
of
old
as
cautious
and
by
no
means
to
be
stampeded
by
a
brother
eloquence
and
he
had
never
looked
on
this
thing
as
anything
better
than
a
hundred
to
one
shot
you
do
it
he
whispered
and
held
his
breath
after
all
he
might
not
have
heard
correctly
all
the
complex
emotion
in
fillmore
soul
found
expression
in
one
vast
whoop
it
rang
through
the
empty
theatre
like
the
last
trump
beating
against
the
back
wall
and
rising
in
hollow
echoes
to
the
very
gallery
bunbury
conversing
in
low
undertones
with
cracknell
across
the
footlights
shied
like
a
startled
mule
there
was
reproach
and
menace
in
the
look
he
cast
at
fillmore
and
a
minute
earlier
it
would
have
reduced
that
financial
magnate
to
apologetic
pulp
but
fillmore
was
not
to
be
intimidated
now
by
a
look
he
strode
down
to
the
group
at
the
footlights
cracknell
he
said
importantly
one
moment
i
should
like
a
word
with
chapter
vii
some
meditations
on
success
if
actors
and
actresses
are
like
children
in
that
they
are
readily
depressed
by
disaster
they
have
the
child
compensating
gift
of
being
easily
uplifted
by
good
fortune
it
amazed
sally
that
any
one
mortal
should
have
been
able
to
spread
such
universal
happiness
as
she
had
done
by
the
simple
act
of
lending
her
brother
fillmore
twenty
thousand
dollars
if
the
millennium
had
arrived
the
members
of
the
primrose
way
company
could
not
have
been
on
better
terms
with
themselves
the
lethargy
and
dispiritedness
caused
by
their
week
of
inaction
fell
from
them
like
a
cloak
the
sudden
elevation
of
that
creature
of
the
abyss
the
assistant
stage
manager
to
the
dizzy
height
of
proprietor
of
the
show
appealed
to
their
sense
of
drama
most
of
them
had
played
in
pieces
where
much
the
same
thing
had
happened
to
the
persecuted
heroine
round
about
eleven
and
the
situation
struck
them
as
theatrically
sound
also
now
that
she
had
gone
the
extent
to
which
miss
hobson
had
acted
as
a
blight
was
universally
recognized
a
spirit
of
optimism
reigned
and
cheerful
rumours
became
current
the
teddy
had
it
straight
from
the
at
his
hotel
that
the
ban
on
the
theatres
was
to
be
lifted
on
tuesday
at
the
latest
while
no
less
an
authority
than
the
girl
at
the
pontchatrain
had
informed
the
man
who
played
the
butler
that
toledo
and
cleveland
were
opening
it
was
generally
felt
that
the
sun
was
bursting
through
the
clouds
and
that
fate
would
soon
despair
of
the
hopeless
task
of
trying
to
keep
good
men
down
fillmore
was
himself
again
we
all
have
our
particular
mode
of
in
moments
of
elation
fillmore
took
the
shape
of
buying
a
new
waistcoat
and
a
hundred
cigars
and
being
very
fussy
about
what
he
had
for
lunch
it
may
have
been
an
optical
illusion
but
he
appeared
to
sally
to
put
on
at
least
six
pounds
in
weight
on
the
first
day
of
the
new
regime
as
a
serf
looking
after
and
other
properties
he
had
been
for
him
almost
slim
as
a
manager
he
blossomed
out
into
soft
billowy
curves
and
when
he
stood
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
theatre
gloating
over
the
new
posters
which
bore
the
legend
fillmore
nicholas
presents
the
populace
had
to
make
a
detour
to
get
round
him
in
this
era
of
bubbling
joy
it
was
hard
that
sally
the
fairy
godmother
responsible
for
it
all
should
not
have
been
completely
happy
too
and
it
puzzled
her
why
she
was
not
but
whatever
it
was
that
cast
the
faint
shadow
refused
obstinately
to
come
out
from
the
back
of
her
mind
and
show
itself
and
be
challenged
it
was
not
till
she
was
out
driving
in
a
hired
car
with
gerald
one
afternoon
on
belle
isle
that
enlightenment
came
gerald
since
the
departure
of
miss
hobson
had
been
at
his
best
like
fillmore
he
was
a
man
who
responded
to
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
his
moodiness
had
vanished
and
all
his
old
charm
had
returned
and
yet
it
seemed
to
sally
as
the
car
slid
smoothly
through
the
pleasant
woods
and
fields
by
the
river
that
there
was
something
that
jarred
gerald
was
cheerful
and
talkative
he
at
any
rate
found
nothing
wrong
with
life
he
held
forth
spaciously
on
the
big
things
he
intended
to
do
if
this
play
get
over
and
it
going
to
i
show
his
jaw
was
squared
and
his
eyes
glowed
as
they
stared
into
the
inviting
future
one
success
that
all
i
need
then
watch
me
i
have
had
a
chance
yet
but
his
voice
rolled
on
but
sally
had
ceased
to
listen
it
was
the
time
of
year
when
the
chill
of
evening
follows
swiftly
on
the
mellow
warmth
of
afternoon
the
sun
had
gone
behind
the
trees
and
a
cold
wind
was
blowing
up
from
the
river
and
quite
suddenly
as
though
it
was
the
wind
that
had
cleared
her
mind
she
understood
what
it
was
that
had
been
lurking
at
the
back
of
her
thoughts
for
an
instant
it
stood
out
nakedly
without
concealment
and
the
world
became
a
forlorn
place
she
had
realized
the
fundamental
difference
between
man
outlook
on
life
and
woman
success
how
men
worshipped
it
and
how
little
of
themselves
they
had
to
spare
for
anything
else
ironically
it
was
the
theme
of
this
very
play
of
gerald
which
she
had
saved
from
destruction
of
all
the
men
she
knew
how
many
had
any
view
of
life
except
as
a
race
which
they
must
strain
every
nerve
to
win
regardless
of
what
they
missed
by
the
wayside
in
their
haste
fillmore
gerald
all
of
them
there
might
be
a
woman
in
each
of
their
lives
but
she
came
second
an
afterthought
a
thing
for
their
spare
time
gerald
was
everything
to
her
his
success
would
never
be
more
than
a
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
he
himself
without
any
of
the
trappings
of
success
was
enough
for
her
but
she
was
not
enough
for
him
a
spasm
of
futile
jealousy
shook
her
she
shivered
cold
said
gerald
i
tell
the
man
to
drive
back
i
do
see
any
reason
why
this
play
should
run
a
year
in
new
york
everybody
says
it
good
if
it
does
get
over
they
all
be
after
me
i
sally
stared
out
into
a
bleak
world
the
sky
was
a
leaden
grey
and
the
wind
from
the
river
blew
with
a
dismal
chill
chapter
viii
reappearance
of
carmyle
and
ginger
when
sally
left
detroit
on
the
following
saturday
accompanied
by
fillmore
who
was
returning
to
the
metropolis
for
a
few
days
in
order
to
secure
offices
and
generally
make
his
presence
felt
along
broadway
her
spirits
had
completely
recovered
she
felt
guiltily
that
she
had
been
fanciful
even
morbid
naturally
men
wanted
to
get
on
in
the
world
it
was
their
job
she
told
herself
that
she
was
bound
up
with
success
and
that
the
last
thing
of
which
she
ought
to
complain
was
the
energy
he
put
into
efforts
of
which
she
as
well
as
he
would
reap
the
reward
to
this
happier
frame
of
mind
the
excitement
of
the
last
few
days
had
contributed
detroit
that
city
of
amiable
audiences
had
liked
the
primrose
the
theatre
in
fulfilment
of
teddy
prophecy
had
been
allowed
to
open
on
the
tuesday
and
a
full
house
hungry
for
entertainment
after
its
enforced
abstinence
had
welcomed
the
play
wholeheartedly
the
papers
not
always
in
agreement
with
the
applause
of
a
audience
had
on
this
occasion
endorsed
the
verdict
with
agreeable
unanimity
hailing
gerald
as
the
coming
author
and
elsa
doland
as
the
coming
star
there
had
even
been
a
brief
mention
of
fillmore
as
the
coming
manager
but
there
is
always
some
trifle
that
jars
in
our
greatest
moments
and
fillmore
triumph
had
been
almost
spoilt
by
the
fact
that
the
only
notice
taken
of
gladys
winch
was
by
the
critic
who
printed
her
name
spelt
wunch
in
the
list
of
those
whom
the
cast
also
one
of
the
greatest
character
actresses
on
the
stage
said
fillmore
bitterly
talking
over
this
outrage
with
sally
on
the
morning
after
the
production
from
this
blow
however
his
buoyant
nature
had
soon
enabled
him
to
rally
life
contained
so
much
that
was
bright
that
it
would
have
been
churlish
to
concentrate
the
attention
on
the
one
dark
spot
business
had
been
excellent
all
through
the
week
elsa
doland
had
got
better
at
every
performance
the
receipt
of
a
long
and
agitated
telegram
from
cracknell
pleading
to
be
allowed
to
buy
the
piece
back
the
passage
of
time
having
apparently
softened
miss
hobson
was
a
pleasant
incident
and
best
of
all
the
great
ike
schumann
who
owned
half
the
theatres
in
new
york
and
had
been
in
detroit
superintending
one
of
his
musical
productions
had
looked
in
one
evening
and
stamped
the
primrose
way
with
the
seal
of
his
approval
as
fillmore
sat
opposite
sally
on
the
train
he
radiated
contentment
and
importance
yes
do
said
sally
breaking
a
long
silence
fillmore
awoke
from
happy
dreams
eh
i
said
do
i
think
you
owe
it
to
your
do
what
buy
a
fur
coat
was
that
what
you
were
meditating
about
do
be
a
chump
said
fillmore
blushing
nevertheless
it
was
true
that
once
or
twice
during
the
past
week
he
had
toyed
negligently
as
bunbury
would
have
said
with
the
notion
and
why
not
a
fellow
must
keep
warm
with
an
astrakhan
collar
insisted
sally
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
fillmore
loftily
his
great
soul
to
this
badinage
what
i
was
really
thinking
about
at
the
moment
was
something
ike
ike
ike
schumann
he
on
the
train
i
met
him
just
we
call
him
ike
of
course
i
call
him
ike
said
fillmore
heatedly
everyone
calls
him
he
wears
a
fur
coat
sally
murmured
fillmore
registered
annoyance
i
wish
you
would
keep
on
harping
on
that
damned
coat
and
anyway
why
should
i
have
a
fur
coat
fill
how
can
you
be
so
brutal
as
to
suggest
that
i
ever
said
you
should
why
i
one
of
the
strongest
supporters
of
the
fur
coat
with
big
cuffs
and
you
must
roll
up
fifth
avenue
in
your
car
and
point
and
say
my
brother
brother
no
is
really
joking
why
that
the
great
fillmore
nicholas
know
but
he
really
is
my
brother
and
i
was
with
him
when
he
bought
that
coat
do
leave
off
about
the
coat
it
is
only
the
coat
i
shall
say
what
underneath
tucked
away
inside
that
mass
of
fur
dodging
about
behind
that
dollar
cigar
is
one
to
whom
we
point
with
pride
fillmore
looked
coldly
at
his
watch
i
got
to
go
and
see
ike
we
are
in
hourly
consultation
with
he
wants
to
see
me
about
the
show
he
suggests
putting
it
into
chicago
before
opening
in
new
oh
no
cried
sally
dismayed
why
not
sally
recovered
herself
identifying
gerald
so
closely
with
his
play
she
had
supposed
for
a
moment
that
if
the
piece
opened
in
chicago
it
would
mean
a
further
prolonged
separation
from
him
but
of
course
there
would
be
no
need
she
realized
for
him
to
stay
with
the
company
after
the
first
day
or
two
you
thinking
that
we
ought
to
have
a
new
york
reputation
before
tackling
chicago
there
a
lot
to
be
said
for
that
still
it
works
both
ways
a
chicago
run
would
help
us
in
new
york
well
i
have
to
think
it
over
said
fillmore
importantly
i
have
to
think
it
he
mused
with
drawn
brows
all
wrong
said
sally
eh
not
a
bit
like
it
the
lips
should
be
compressed
and
the
forefinger
of
the
right
hand
laid
in
a
careworn
way
against
the
right
temple
you
a
lot
to
learn
oh
stop
it
fillmore
nicholas
said
sally
if
you
knew
what
pain
it
gives
me
to
josh
my
only
brother
you
be
sorry
for
me
but
you
know
it
for
your
good
now
run
along
and
put
ike
out
of
his
misery
i
know
he
waiting
for
you
with
his
watch
out
do
think
he
come
miss
nicholas
were
his
last
words
to
me
as
he
stepped
on
the
train
and
oh
fill
the
yearning
in
his
voice
of
course
he
will
schumann
i
said
all
his
exalted
position
my
brother
is
kindliness
itself
of
course
he
come
i
could
only
think
so
he
said
with
a
gulp
i
could
only
think
so
but
you
know
what
these
managers
are
a
thousand
calls
on
their
time
they
get
brooding
on
their
fur
coats
and
forget
everything
else
no
fear
schumann
i
said
nicholas
is
a
man
of
his
word
she
would
have
been
willing
for
she
was
a
girl
who
never
believed
in
sparing
herself
where
it
was
a
question
of
entertaining
her
nearest
and
dearest
to
continue
the
dialogue
but
fillmore
was
already
moving
down
the
car
his
rigid
back
a
silent
protest
against
sisterly
levity
sally
watched
him
disappear
then
picked
up
a
magazine
and
began
to
read
she
had
just
finished
tracking
a
story
of
gripping
interest
through
a
jungle
of
advertisements
only
to
find
that
it
was
in
two
parts
of
which
the
one
she
was
reading
was
the
first
when
a
voice
spoke
how
do
you
do
miss
nicholas
into
the
seat
before
her
recently
released
from
the
weight
of
the
coming
manager
bruce
carmyle
of
all
people
in
the
world
insinuated
himself
with
that
air
of
deferential
restraint
which
never
left
him
sally
was
considerably
startled
everybody
travels
nowadays
of
course
and
there
is
nothing
really
remarkable
in
finding
a
man
in
america
whom
you
had
supposed
to
be
in
europe
but
nevertheless
she
was
conscious
of
a
sensation
as
though
the
clock
had
been
turned
back
and
a
chapter
of
her
life
reopened
which
she
had
thought
closed
for
ever
mr
carmyle
she
cried
if
sally
had
been
constantly
in
bruce
carmyle
thoughts
since
they
had
parted
on
the
paris
express
carmyle
had
been
very
little
in
sally
so
little
indeed
that
she
had
had
to
search
her
memory
for
a
moment
before
she
identified
him
we
always
meeting
on
trains
are
we
she
went
on
her
composure
returning
i
never
expected
to
see
you
in
i
came
sally
was
tempted
to
reply
that
she
gathered
that
but
a
sudden
embarrassment
curbed
her
tongue
she
had
just
remembered
that
at
their
last
meeting
she
had
been
abominably
rude
to
this
man
she
was
never
rude
to
anyone
without
subsequent
remorse
she
contented
herself
with
a
tame
yes
said
carmyle
it
is
a
good
many
years
since
i
have
taken
a
real
holiday
my
doctor
seemed
to
think
i
was
a
trifle
run
down
it
seemed
a
good
opportunity
to
visit
america
everybody
said
carmyle
oracularly
endeavouring
as
he
had
often
done
since
his
ship
had
left
england
to
persuade
himself
that
his
object
in
making
the
trip
had
not
been
merely
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
sally
everybody
ought
to
visit
america
at
least
once
it
is
part
of
one
and
what
are
your
impressions
of
our
glorious
country
said
sally
rallying
carmyle
seemed
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
lecturing
on
an
impersonal
subject
he
too
though
his
face
had
shown
no
trace
of
it
had
been
embarrassed
in
the
opening
stages
of
the
conversation
the
sound
of
his
voice
restored
him
i
have
been
visiting
chicago
he
said
after
a
brief
travelogue
oh
a
wonderful
i
never
seen
it
i
come
from
yes
i
heard
you
were
in
sally
eyes
opened
you
heard
i
was
in
detroit
good
gracious
how
i
ah
called
at
your
new
york
address
and
made
inquiries
said
carmyle
a
little
awkwardly
but
how
did
you
know
where
i
lived
my
cousin
er
lancelot
told
sally
was
silent
for
a
moment
she
had
much
the
same
feeling
that
comes
to
the
man
in
the
detective
story
who
realizes
that
he
is
being
shadowed
even
if
this
almost
complete
stranger
had
not
actually
come
to
america
in
direct
pursuit
of
her
there
was
no
disguising
the
fact
that
he
evidently
found
her
an
object
of
considerable
interest
it
was
a
compliment
but
sally
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
liked
it
bruce
carmyle
meant
nothing
to
her
and
it
was
rather
disturbing
to
find
that
she
was
apparently
of
great
importance
to
him
she
seized
on
the
mention
of
ginger
as
a
lever
for
diverting
the
conversation
from
its
present
too
intimate
course
how
is
kemp
she
asked
carmyle
dark
face
seemed
to
become
a
trifle
darker
we
have
had
no
news
of
him
he
said
shortly
no
news
how
do
you
mean
you
speak
as
though
he
had
he
has
disappeared
good
heavens
when
shortly
after
i
saw
you
disappeared
carmyle
frowned
sally
watching
him
found
her
antipathy
stirring
again
there
was
something
about
this
man
which
she
had
disliked
instinctively
from
the
first
a
sort
of
hardness
but
where
has
he
gone
to
i
do
carmyle
frowned
again
the
subject
of
ginger
was
plainly
a
sore
one
and
i
do
want
to
know
he
went
on
heatedly
a
dull
flush
rising
in
the
cheeks
which
sally
was
sure
he
had
to
shave
twice
a
day
i
do
care
to
know
the
family
have
washed
their
hands
of
him
for
the
future
he
may
look
after
himself
as
best
he
can
i
believe
he
is
off
his
sally
rebellious
temper
was
well
ablaze
now
but
she
fought
it
down
she
would
dearly
have
loved
to
give
battle
to
carmyle
it
was
odd
she
felt
how
she
seemed
to
have
constituted
herself
ginger
champion
and
protector
but
she
perceived
that
if
she
wished
as
she
did
to
hear
more
of
her
friend
he
must
be
humoured
and
conciliated
but
what
happened
what
was
all
the
trouble
about
carmyle
eyebrows
met
he
insulted
his
uncle
his
uncle
donald
he
insulted
him
grossly
the
one
man
in
the
world
he
should
have
made
a
point
of
er
keeping
in
with
yes
his
future
depended
upon
but
what
did
he
do
cried
sally
trying
hard
to
keep
a
thoroughly
reprehensible
joy
out
of
her
voice
i
have
heard
no
details
my
uncle
is
reticent
as
to
what
actually
took
place
he
invited
lancelot
to
dinner
to
discuss
his
plans
and
it
appears
that
lancelot
defied
him
defied
him
he
was
rude
and
insulting
my
uncle
refuses
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
apparently
the
young
fool
managed
to
win
some
money
at
the
tables
at
roville
and
this
seems
to
have
turned
his
head
completely
my
uncle
insists
that
he
is
mad
i
agree
with
him
since
the
night
of
that
dinner
nothing
has
been
heard
of
carmyle
broke
off
to
brood
once
more
and
before
sally
could
speak
the
impressive
bulk
of
fillmore
loomed
up
in
the
aisle
beside
them
explanations
seemed
to
fillmore
to
be
in
order
he
cast
a
questioning
glance
at
the
mysterious
stranger
who
in
addition
to
being
in
conversation
with
his
sister
had
collared
his
seat
oh
hullo
fill
said
sally
fillmore
this
is
carmyle
we
met
abroad
my
brother
fillmore
proper
introduction
having
been
thus
effected
fillmore
approved
of
carmyle
his
air
of
being
someone
in
particular
appealed
to
him
strange
you
meeting
again
like
this
he
said
affably
the
porter
who
had
been
making
up
berths
along
the
car
was
now
hovering
expectantly
in
the
offing
you
two
had
better
go
into
the
smoking
room
suggested
sally
going
to
she
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
carmyle
tale
of
a
roused
and
revolting
ginger
had
stirred
her
the
two
men
went
off
to
the
and
sally
found
an
empty
seat
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
her
berth
to
be
made
up
she
was
aglow
with
a
curious
exhilaration
so
ginger
had
taken
her
advice
excellent
ginger
she
felt
proud
of
him
she
also
had
that
feeling
of
complacency
amounting
almost
to
sinful
pride
which
comes
to
those
who
give
advice
and
find
it
acted
upon
she
had
the
emotions
of
a
creator
after
all
had
she
not
created
this
new
ginger
it
was
she
who
had
stirred
him
up
it
was
she
who
had
unleashed
him
she
had
changed
him
from
a
meek
dependent
of
the
family
to
a
ravening
creature
who
went
about
the
place
insulting
uncles
it
was
a
feat
there
was
no
denying
it
it
was
something
attempted
something
done
and
by
all
the
rules
laid
down
by
the
poet
it
should
therefore
have
earned
a
night
repose
yet
sally
jolted
by
the
train
which
towards
the
small
hours
seemed
to
be
trying
out
some
new
steps
of
its
own
invention
slept
ill
and
presently
as
she
lay
awake
there
came
to
her
bedside
the
spectre
of
doubt
gaunt
and
questioning
had
she
after
all
wrought
so
well
had
she
been
wise
in
tampering
with
this
young
man
life
what
about
it
said
the
spectre
of
doubt
daylight
brought
no
comforting
answer
to
the
question
breakfast
failed
to
manufacture
an
easy
mind
sally
got
off
the
train
at
the
grand
central
station
in
a
state
of
remorseful
concern
she
declined
the
offer
of
carmyle
to
drive
her
to
the
and
started
to
walk
there
hoping
that
the
crisp
morning
air
would
effect
a
cure
she
wondered
now
how
she
could
ever
have
looked
with
approval
on
her
rash
act
she
wondered
what
demon
of
interference
and
meddling
had
possessed
her
to
make
her
blunder
into
people
lives
upsetting
them
she
wondered
that
she
was
allowed
to
go
around
loose
she
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
menace
to
society
here
was
an
estimable
young
man
obviously
the
sort
of
young
man
who
would
always
have
to
be
assisted
through
life
by
his
relatives
and
she
had
deliberately
egged
him
on
to
wreck
his
prospects
she
blushed
hotly
as
she
remembered
that
mad
wireless
she
had
sent
him
from
the
boat
miserable
ginger
she
pictured
him
his
little
stock
of
money
gone
wandering
about
london
seeking
in
vain
for
work
forcing
himself
to
call
on
uncle
donald
being
thrown
down
the
front
steps
by
haughty
footmen
sleeping
on
the
embankment
gazing
into
the
dark
waters
of
the
thames
with
the
stare
of
hopelessness
climbing
to
the
parapet
and
ugh
said
sally
she
had
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
and
meecher
was
regarding
her
with
welcoming
eyes
little
knowing
that
to
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
she
had
slain
in
his
prime
a
young
man
of
amiable
manners
and
when
not
by
meddling
muddling
females
of
excellent
behaviour
meecher
was
friendly
and
garrulous
variety
the
journal
which
next
to
the
dog
toto
was
the
thing
she
loved
best
in
the
world
had
informed
her
on
the
friday
morning
that
foster
play
had
got
over
big
in
detroit
and
that
miss
doland
had
made
every
kind
of
hit
it
was
not
often
that
the
old
alumni
of
the
forced
their
way
after
this
fashion
into
the
hall
of
fame
and
according
to
meecher
the
establishment
was
ringing
with
the
news
that
blue
ribbon
round
toto
neck
was
worn
in
honour
of
the
triumph
there
was
also
though
you
could
not
see
it
a
chicken
dinner
in
toto
interior
by
way
of
further
celebration
and
was
it
true
that
fillmore
had
bought
the
piece
a
great
man
was
meecher
verdict
faucitt
had
always
said
so
oh
how
is
faucitt
sally
asked
reproaching
herself
for
having
allowed
the
pressure
of
other
matters
to
drive
all
thoughts
of
her
late
patient
from
her
mind
he
gone
said
meecher
with
such
relish
that
to
sally
in
her
morbid
condition
the
words
had
only
one
meaning
she
turned
white
and
clutched
at
the
banisters
gone
to
england
added
meecher
sally
was
vastly
relieved
oh
i
thought
you
meant
oh
no
not
meecher
sighed
for
she
had
been
a
little
disappointed
in
the
old
gentleman
who
started
out
as
such
a
promising
invalid
only
to
fall
away
into
the
dullness
of
robust
health
once
more
he
well
enough
i
never
seen
anybody
better
you
think
said
meecher
bearing
up
with
difficulty
under
her
grievance
think
this
here
new
spanish
influenza
was
a
sort
of
a
tonic
or
the
way
he
looks
now
of
course
she
added
trying
to
find
justification
for
a
respected
lodger
he
had
good
news
his
what
not
i
do
mean
that
that
was
good
news
far
from
it
though
come
to
think
of
it
all
flesh
is
as
grass
and
we
all
got
to
be
prepared
for
of
the
sort
breaking
loose
but
it
seems
this
here
new
brother
of
his
i
did
know
he
a
brother
and
i
do
suppose
you
knew
he
had
a
brother
men
are
secretive
ai
they
this
brother
of
his
has
left
him
a
parcel
of
money
and
faucitt
he
had
to
get
on
the
wednesday
boat
quick
as
he
could
and
go
right
over
to
the
other
side
to
look
after
things
wind
up
the
estate
i
believe
they
call
it
left
in
a
awful
hurry
he
did
sent
his
love
to
you
and
said
he
write
funny
him
having
a
brother
now
was
it
not
said
meecher
at
heart
a
reasonable
woman
that
folks
do
have
brothers
i
got
two
myself
one
in
portland
oregon
and
the
other
goodness
knows
where
he
is
but
what
i
trying
to
say
sally
disengaged
herself
and
went
up
to
her
room
for
a
brief
while
the
excitement
which
comes
of
hearing
good
news
about
those
of
whom
we
are
fond
acted
as
a
stimulant
and
she
felt
almost
cheerful
dear
old
faucitt
she
was
sorry
for
his
brother
of
course
though
she
had
never
had
the
pleasure
of
his
acquaintance
and
had
only
just
heard
that
he
had
ever
existed
but
it
was
nice
to
think
that
her
old
friend
remaining
years
would
be
years
of
affluence
presently
however
she
found
her
thoughts
wandering
back
into
their
melancholy
groove
she
threw
herself
wearily
on
the
bed
she
was
tired
after
her
bad
night
but
she
could
not
sleep
remorse
kept
her
awake
besides
she
could
hear
meecher
prowling
disturbingly
about
the
house
apparently
in
search
of
someone
her
progress
indicated
by
creaking
boards
and
the
strenuous
yapping
of
toto
sally
turned
restlessly
and
having
turned
remained
for
a
long
instant
transfixed
and
rigid
she
had
seen
something
and
what
she
had
seen
was
enough
to
surprise
any
girl
in
the
privacy
of
her
bedroom
from
underneath
the
bed
there
peeped
coyly
forth
an
undeniably
masculine
shoe
and
six
inches
of
a
grey
sally
bounded
to
the
floor
she
was
a
girl
of
courage
and
she
meant
to
probe
this
matter
thoroughly
what
are
you
doing
under
my
bed
the
question
was
a
reasonable
one
and
evidently
seemed
to
the
intruder
to
deserve
an
answer
there
was
a
muffled
sneeze
and
he
began
to
crawl
out
the
shoe
came
first
then
the
legs
then
a
sturdy
body
in
a
dusty
coat
and
finally
there
flashed
on
sally
fascinated
gaze
a
head
of
so
nearly
the
maximum
redness
that
it
could
only
belong
to
one
person
in
the
world
ginger
lancelot
kemp
on
all
fours
blinked
up
at
her
oh
hullo
he
said
chapter
ix
ginger
becomes
a
man
it
was
not
till
she
saw
him
actually
standing
there
before
her
with
his
hair
rumpled
and
a
large
smut
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
that
sally
really
understood
how
profoundly
troubled
she
had
been
about
this
young
man
and
how
vivid
had
been
that
vision
of
him
bobbing
about
on
the
waters
of
the
thames
a
cold
and
unappreciated
corpse
she
was
a
girl
of
keen
imagination
and
she
had
allowed
her
imagination
to
riot
unchecked
astonishment
therefore
at
the
extraordinary
fact
of
his
being
there
was
for
the
moment
thrust
aside
by
relief
never
before
in
her
life
had
she
experienced
such
an
overwhelming
rush
of
exhilaration
she
flung
herself
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
a
screech
of
laughter
which
even
to
her
own
ears
sounded
strange
it
struck
ginger
as
hysterical
i
say
you
know
said
ginger
as
the
merriment
showed
no
signs
of
abating
ginger
was
concerned
nasty
shock
for
a
girl
finding
blighters
under
her
bed
sally
sat
up
gurgling
and
wiped
her
eyes
oh
i
am
glad
to
see
you
she
gasped
no
really
said
ginger
gratified
that
it
occurred
to
him
that
some
sort
of
apology
would
be
a
graceful
act
i
say
you
know
awfully
sorry
about
barging
in
here
i
mean
never
dreamed
it
was
your
room
unoccupied
i
do
mention
it
i
ought
not
to
have
disturbed
you
you
were
having
a
nice
sleep
of
course
do
you
always
sleep
on
the
floor
it
was
like
this
of
course
if
you
wearing
it
for
ornament
as
a
sort
of
said
sally
all
right
but
in
case
you
do
know
a
smut
on
your
oh
my
aunt
not
really
now
would
i
deceive
you
on
an
important
point
like
that
do
you
mind
if
i
have
a
look
in
the
glass
certainly
if
you
can
stand
ginger
moved
hurriedly
to
the
you
perfectly
right
he
announced
applying
his
handkerchief
i
thought
i
was
i
very
quick
at
noticing
my
hair
a
bit
rumpled
very
much
you
take
my
tip
said
ginger
earnestly
and
never
lie
about
under
beds
there
nothing
in
that
reminds
me
you
wo
be
offended
if
i
asked
you
something
no
no
go
it
rather
an
impertinent
question
you
may
resent
no
well
then
what
were
you
doing
under
my
bed
oh
under
your
bed
yes
under
my
bed
this
it
a
bed
you
know
mine
my
bed
you
were
under
it
why
or
putting
it
another
way
why
were
you
under
my
bed
i
was
playing
that
explains
mrs
beecher
meecher
was
after
sally
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
you
must
encourage
meecher
in
these
childish
pastimes
it
unsettles
ginger
passed
an
agitated
hand
over
his
forehead
it
like
this
i
hate
to
keep
criticizing
your
appearance
said
sally
and
personally
i
like
it
but
when
you
clutched
your
brow
just
then
you
put
about
a
pound
of
dust
on
it
your
hands
are
probably
ginger
inspected
them
they
are
why
not
make
a
really
good
job
of
it
and
have
a
wash
do
you
mind
i
prefer
thanks
awfully
i
mean
to
say
it
your
basin
you
know
and
all
that
what
i
mean
is
seem
to
be
making
myself
pretty
well
at
oh
touching
the
matter
of
soap
use
mine
we
americans
are
famous
for
our
thanks
the
towel
is
on
your
thanks
and
i
a
clothes
brush
in
my
thanks
splashing
followed
like
a
taking
a
dip
now
then
said
sally
why
were
you
hiding
from
meecher
a
careworn
almost
hunted
look
came
into
ginger
face
i
say
you
know
that
woman
is
rather
by
way
of
being
one
of
the
lads
what
scares
me
word
was
brought
that
she
was
on
the
prowl
so
it
seemed
to
me
a
judicious
move
to
take
cover
till
she
sort
of
blew
over
if
she
found
me
she
have
made
me
take
that
dog
of
hers
for
a
toto
toto
you
know
said
ginger
with
a
strong
sense
of
injury
no
got
a
right
to
be
a
dog
like
that
i
do
suppose
there
anyone
keener
on
dogs
than
i
am
but
a
thing
like
a
woolly
he
shuddered
slightly
well
one
hates
to
be
seen
about
with
it
in
the
public
why
could
you
have
refused
in
a
firm
but
gentlemanly
manner
to
take
toto
out
ah
there
you
rather
touch
the
spot
you
see
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
a
bit
behind
with
the
rent
and
that
makes
it
rather
hard
to
take
what
you
might
call
a
firm
but
how
can
you
be
behind
with
the
rent
i
only
left
here
the
saturday
before
last
and
you
were
in
the
place
then
you
ca
have
been
here
more
than
a
i
been
here
just
a
week
that
the
week
i
behind
but
why
you
were
a
millionaire
when
i
left
you
at
well
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
went
back
to
the
tables
that
night
and
lost
a
goodish
bit
of
what
i
won
and
somehow
or
another
when
i
got
to
america
the
stuff
seemed
to
slip
what
made
you
come
to
america
at
all
said
sally
asking
the
question
which
she
felt
any
sensible
person
would
have
asked
at
the
opening
of
the
conversation
one
of
his
familiar
blushes
raced
over
ginger
face
oh
i
thought
i
would
land
of
opportunity
you
have
you
managed
to
find
any
of
the
opportunities
yet
well
i
have
got
a
job
of
sorts
i
a
waiter
at
a
rummy
little
place
on
second
avenue
the
salary
is
big
but
i
have
wangled
enough
out
of
it
to
pay
last
week
rent
only
they
docked
me
a
goodish
bit
for
breaking
plates
and
what
not
the
fact
is
i
making
rather
a
hash
of
oh
ginger
you
ought
to
be
a
waiter
that
what
the
boss
seems
to
i
mean
you
ought
to
be
doing
something
ever
so
much
but
what
you
no
notion
how
well
all
these
blighters
here
seem
to
be
able
to
get
along
without
my
help
i
tramped
all
over
the
place
offering
my
services
but
they
all
say
they
try
to
carry
on
as
they
sally
reflected
i
know
what
i
make
fillmore
give
you
a
job
i
wonder
i
did
think
of
it
fillmore
my
brother
yes
he
be
able
to
use
what
as
sally
considered
as
a
as
a
oh
as
his
does
he
want
a
man
sure
to
he
a
young
fellow
trying
to
get
along
sure
to
want
a
yes
said
ginger
reflectively
of
course
i
never
been
a
man
you
oh
you
pick
it
up
i
take
you
round
to
him
now
he
staying
at
the
there
just
one
thing
said
ginger
what
that
i
might
make
a
hash
of
heavens
ginger
there
must
be
something
in
this
world
that
you
would
make
a
hash
of
do
stand
arguing
any
longer
are
you
dry
and
clean
very
well
then
let
be
right
ginger
took
a
step
towards
the
door
then
paused
rigid
with
one
leg
in
the
air
as
though
some
spell
had
been
cast
upon
him
from
the
passage
outside
there
had
sounded
a
shrill
yapping
ginger
looked
at
sally
then
he
looked
longingly
at
the
bed
do
be
such
a
coward
said
sally
severely
yes
but
how
much
do
you
owe
meecher
round
about
twelve
dollars
i
think
it
i
pay
ginger
flushed
awkwardly
no
i
hanged
if
you
will
i
mean
he
stammered
it
frightfully
good
of
you
and
all
that
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
but
honestly
i
could
sally
did
not
press
the
point
she
liked
him
the
better
for
a
rugged
independence
which
in
the
days
of
his
impecuniousness
her
brother
fillmore
had
never
dreamed
of
exhibiting
very
well
she
said
have
it
your
own
way
proud
that
me
all
over
mabel
ginger
she
broke
off
sharply
pull
yourself
together
where
is
your
manly
spirit
i
be
ashamed
to
be
such
a
awfully
sorry
but
honestly
that
woolly
dog
never
mind
the
dog
i
see
you
they
came
out
into
the
passage
almost
on
top
of
toto
who
was
stalking
phantom
rats
meecher
was
manoeuvring
in
the
background
her
face
lit
up
grimly
at
the
sight
of
ginger
mister
kemp
i
been
looking
for
sally
intervened
brightly
oh
meecher
she
said
shepherding
her
young
charge
through
the
danger
zone
i
was
so
surprised
to
meet
kemp
here
he
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
we
met
in
france
we
going
off
now
to
have
a
long
talk
about
old
times
and
then
i
taking
him
to
see
my
brother
toto
dear
little
thing
you
ought
to
take
him
for
a
walk
said
sally
a
lovely
day
kemp
was
saying
just
now
that
he
would
have
liked
to
take
him
but
we
rather
in
a
hurry
and
shall
probably
have
to
get
into
a
taxi
you
no
idea
how
busy
my
brother
is
just
now
if
late
he
never
forgive
she
passed
on
down
the
stairs
leaving
meecher
dissatisfied
but
irresolute
there
was
something
about
sally
which
even
in
her
days
had
always
baffled
meecher
and
cramped
her
style
and
now
that
she
was
rich
and
independent
she
inspired
in
the
chatelaine
of
the
an
emotion
which
was
almost
awe
the
front
door
had
closed
before
meecher
had
collected
her
faculties
and
ginger
pausing
on
the
sidewalk
drew
a
long
breath
you
know
you
wonderful
he
said
regarding
sally
with
unconcealed
admiration
she
accepted
the
compliment
composedly
now
we
go
and
hunt
up
fillmore
she
said
but
there
no
need
to
hurry
of
course
really
we
go
for
a
walk
first
and
then
call
at
the
astor
and
make
him
give
us
lunch
i
want
to
hear
all
about
you
heard
something
already
i
met
your
cousin
carmyle
he
was
on
the
train
coming
from
detroit
did
you
know
that
he
was
in
america
no
i
er
rather
lost
touch
with
the
so
i
gathered
from
carmyle
and
i
feel
hideously
responsible
it
was
all
through
me
that
all
this
oh
of
course
it
was
i
made
you
what
you
are
i
hope
satisfied
i
dragged
and
dragged
you
down
until
the
soul
within
you
died
so
to
speak
i
know
perfectly
well
that
you
would
have
dreamed
of
savaging
the
family
as
you
seem
to
have
done
if
it
had
been
for
what
i
said
to
you
at
roville
ginger
tell
me
what
did
happen
dying
to
know
carmyle
said
you
insulted
your
uncle
donald
yes
we
did
have
a
bit
of
a
scrap
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
made
me
go
out
to
dinner
with
him
and
we
er
sort
of
disagreed
to
start
with
he
wanted
me
to
apologize
to
old
scrymgeour
and
i
rather
gave
it
a
noble
fellow
scrymgeour
no
silly
oh
ah
ginger
blushed
and
then
there
was
all
that
about
the
soup
you
how
do
you
mean
that
about
the
soup
what
about
the
soup
what
soup
well
things
sort
of
hotted
up
a
bit
when
the
soup
i
do
i
mean
the
trouble
seemed
to
start
as
it
were
when
the
waiter
had
finished
ladling
out
the
mulligatawny
thick
soup
you
i
know
mulligatawny
is
a
thick
soup
yes
well
my
old
uncle
i
not
blaming
him
do
you
know
more
his
misfortune
than
his
fault
i
can
see
that
now
but
he
got
a
heavy
moustache
like
a
walrus
rather
and
he
a
bit
apt
to
inhale
the
stuff
through
it
and
i
well
i
asked
him
not
to
it
was
just
a
suggestion
you
know
he
cut
up
fairly
rough
and
by
the
time
the
fish
came
round
we
were
more
or
less
down
on
the
mat
chewing
holes
in
one
another
my
fault
probably
i
was
feeling
particularly
towards
the
family
that
night
i
just
had
a
talk
with
bruce
my
cousin
you
know
in
piccadilly
and
that
had
rather
got
the
wind
up
me
bruce
always
seems
to
get
on
my
nerves
a
bit
somehow
and
uncle
donald
asking
me
to
dinner
and
all
that
by
the
way
did
you
get
the
books
what
books
bruce
said
he
wanted
to
send
you
some
books
that
was
why
i
gave
him
your
sally
stared
he
never
sent
me
any
well
he
said
he
was
going
to
and
i
had
to
tell
him
where
to
send
sally
walked
on
a
little
thoughtfully
she
was
not
a
vain
girl
but
it
was
impossible
not
to
perceive
in
the
light
of
this
fresh
evidence
that
carmyle
had
made
a
journey
of
three
thousand
miles
with
the
sole
object
of
renewing
his
acquaintance
with
her
it
did
not
matter
of
course
but
it
was
vaguely
disturbing
no
girl
cares
to
be
dogged
by
a
man
she
rather
dislikes
go
on
telling
me
about
your
uncle
she
said
well
there
not
much
more
to
tell
i
happened
to
get
that
wireless
of
yours
just
before
i
started
out
to
dinner
with
him
and
i
was
more
or
less
feeling
that
i
was
going
to
stand
any
rot
from
the
family
got
to
the
fish
course
had
i
well
we
managed
to
get
through
that
somehow
but
we
did
survive
the
fillet
steak
one
thing
seemed
to
lead
to
another
and
the
show
sort
of
bust
up
he
called
me
a
good
many
things
and
i
got
a
bit
and
finally
i
told
him
i
had
any
more
use
for
the
family
and
was
going
to
start
out
on
my
own
and
well
i
did
do
you
know
and
here
i
sally
listened
to
this
saga
breathlessly
more
than
ever
did
she
feel
responsible
for
her
young
protégé
and
any
faint
qualms
which
she
had
entertained
as
to
the
wisdom
of
transferring
practically
the
whole
of
her
patrimony
to
the
care
of
so
erratic
a
financier
as
her
brother
vanished
it
was
her
plain
duty
to
see
that
ginger
was
started
well
in
the
race
of
life
and
fillmore
was
going
to
come
in
uncommonly
handy
we
go
to
the
astor
now
she
said
and
i
introduce
you
to
fillmore
he
a
theatrical
manager
and
he
sure
to
have
something
for
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
bother
about
ginger
said
sally
i
regard
you
as
a
grandson
hail
that
cab
will
you
chapter
sally
in
the
shadows
it
seemed
to
sally
in
the
weeks
that
followed
her
reunion
with
ginger
kemp
that
a
sort
of
golden
age
had
set
in
on
all
the
frontiers
of
her
little
kingdom
there
was
peace
and
prosperity
and
she
woke
each
morning
in
a
world
so
neatly
smoothed
and
ironed
out
that
the
most
captious
pessimist
could
hardly
have
found
anything
in
it
to
criticize
true
gerald
was
still
a
thousand
miles
away
going
to
chicago
to
superintend
the
opening
of
the
primrose
way
for
fillmore
had
acceded
to
his
friend
ike
suggestion
in
the
matter
of
producing
it
first
in
chicago
and
he
had
been
called
in
by
a
distracted
manager
to
revise
the
work
of
a
brother
dramatist
whose
comedy
was
in
difficulties
at
one
of
the
theatres
in
that
city
and
this
meant
he
would
have
to
remain
on
the
spot
for
some
time
to
come
it
was
disappointing
for
sally
had
been
looking
forward
to
having
him
back
in
new
york
in
a
few
days
but
she
refused
to
allow
herself
to
be
depressed
life
as
a
whole
was
much
too
satisfactory
for
that
life
indeed
in
every
other
respect
seemed
perfect
fillmore
was
going
strong
ginger
was
off
her
conscience
she
had
found
an
apartment
her
new
hat
suited
her
and
the
primrose
way
was
a
tremendous
success
chicago
it
appeared
from
fillmore
account
was
paying
little
attention
to
anything
except
the
primrose
national
problems
had
ceased
to
interest
the
citizens
local
problems
left
them
cold
their
minds
were
riveted
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
on
the
problem
of
how
to
secure
seats
the
production
of
the
piece
according
to
fillmore
had
been
the
most
terrific
experience
that
had
come
to
stir
chicago
since
the
great
fire
of
all
these
satisfactory
happenings
the
most
satisfactory
to
thinking
was
the
fact
that
the
problem
of
ginger
future
had
been
solved
ginger
had
entered
the
service
of
the
fillmore
nicholas
theatrical
enterprises
managing
director
fillmore
nicholas
fillmore
would
have
made
the
title
longer
only
that
was
all
that
would
go
on
the
brass
plate
and
was
to
be
found
daily
in
the
outer
office
his
duties
consisting
mainly
it
seemed
in
reading
the
evening
papers
what
exactly
he
was
even
ginger
hardly
knew
sometimes
he
felt
like
the
man
at
the
wheel
sometimes
like
a
glorified
office
boy
and
not
so
very
glorified
at
that
for
the
most
part
he
had
to
prevent
the
mob
rushing
and
getting
at
fillmore
who
sat
in
state
in
the
inner
office
pondering
great
schemes
but
though
there
might
be
an
occasional
passing
uncertainty
in
mind
as
to
just
what
he
was
supposed
to
be
doing
in
exchange
for
the
fifty
dollars
he
drew
every
friday
there
was
nothing
uncertain
about
his
gratitude
to
sally
for
having
pulled
the
strings
and
enabled
him
to
do
it
he
tried
to
thank
her
every
time
they
met
and
nowadays
they
were
meeting
frequently
for
ginger
was
helping
her
to
furnish
her
new
apartment
in
this
task
he
spared
no
efforts
he
said
that
it
kept
him
in
condition
and
what
i
mean
to
say
is
said
ginger
pausing
in
the
act
of
carrying
a
massive
easy
chair
to
the
third
spot
which
sally
had
selected
in
the
last
ten
minutes
if
i
did
sweat
about
a
bit
and
help
you
after
the
way
you
got
me
that
job
ginger
desist
said
sally
yes
but
honestly
if
you
do
stop
it
i
make
you
move
that
chair
into
the
next
shall
i
ginger
rubbed
his
blistered
hands
and
took
a
new
grip
anything
you
silly
of
course
not
the
only
other
rooms
are
my
bedroom
the
bathroom
and
the
kitchen
what
on
earth
would
i
want
a
great
lumbering
chair
in
them
for
all
the
same
i
believe
the
first
we
chose
was
the
back
she
goes
then
what
sally
reflected
frowningly
this
business
of
setting
up
house
was
causing
her
much
thought
no
she
decided
by
the
window
is
she
looked
at
him
remorsefully
i
giving
you
a
lot
of
trouble
ginger
accompanied
by
a
chair
staggered
across
the
room
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
he
wiped
a
bead
of
perspiration
from
his
freckled
forehead
you
got
me
that
job
and
stop
right
ho
still
you
did
you
sally
sat
down
in
the
armchair
and
stretched
herself
watching
ginger
work
had
given
her
a
vicarious
fatigue
she
surveyed
the
room
proudly
it
was
certainly
beginning
to
look
cosy
the
pictures
were
up
the
carpet
down
the
furniture
very
neatly
in
order
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
the
restful
sensation
of
being
at
home
she
had
always
longed
during
the
past
three
years
of
existence
for
a
settled
abode
a
place
where
she
could
lock
the
door
on
herself
and
be
alone
the
apartment
was
small
but
it
was
undeniably
a
haven
she
looked
about
her
and
could
see
no
flaw
in
it
except
she
had
a
sudden
sense
of
something
missing
hullo
she
said
where
that
photograph
of
me
i
sure
i
put
it
on
the
mantelpiece
his
exertions
seemed
to
have
brought
the
blood
to
ginger
face
he
was
a
rich
red
he
inspected
the
mantelpiece
narrowly
no
no
photograph
i
know
there
is
but
it
was
there
yesterday
or
was
it
i
know
i
meant
to
put
it
there
perhaps
i
forgot
it
the
most
beautiful
thing
you
ever
saw
not
a
bit
like
me
but
what
of
that
they
touch
up
in
the
you
know
i
value
it
because
it
looks
the
way
i
should
like
to
look
if
i
i
never
had
a
beautiful
photograph
taken
of
myself
said
ginger
solemnly
with
gentle
regret
cheer
up
oh
i
do
mind
i
only
mentioned
ginger
said
sally
pardon
my
interrupting
your
remarks
which
i
know
are
valuable
but
this
chair
is
not
right
it
ought
to
be
where
it
was
at
the
beginning
could
you
give
your
imitation
of
a
just
once
more
and
after
that
i
make
you
some
tea
if
there
any
tea
or
milk
or
there
are
cups
all
right
i
know
because
i
smashed
two
the
day
before
yesterday
i
nip
round
the
corner
for
some
milk
shall
i
yes
please
nip
all
this
hard
work
has
taken
it
out
of
me
over
the
sally
became
inquisitive
what
i
ca
understand
about
this
job
of
yours
ginger
which
as
you
are
just
about
to
observe
i
was
noble
enough
to
secure
for
you
is
the
amount
of
leisure
that
seems
to
go
with
it
how
is
it
that
you
are
able
to
spend
your
valuable
time
fillmore
valuable
time
rather
juggling
with
my
furniture
every
day
oh
i
can
usually
get
but
ought
you
to
be
at
your
post
doing
whatever
it
is
you
do
what
do
you
do
ginger
stirred
his
tea
thoughtfully
and
gave
his
mind
to
the
question
well
i
sort
of
mess
about
you
he
pondered
i
interview
divers
blighters
and
tell
your
brother
is
out
and
take
their
names
and
addresses
and
oh
all
that
sort
of
does
fillmore
consult
you
much
he
lets
me
read
some
of
the
plays
that
are
sent
in
awful
tosh
most
of
them
sometimes
he
sends
me
off
to
a
vaudeville
house
of
an
as
a
treat
to
see
some
special
act
you
know
to
report
on
it
in
case
he
might
want
to
use
it
for
this
revue
of
which
revue
did
you
know
he
was
going
to
put
on
a
revue
oh
rather
a
whacking
big
affair
going
to
cut
out
the
follies
and
all
that
sort
of
but
my
goodness
sally
was
alarmed
it
was
just
like
fillmore
she
felt
to
go
branching
out
into
these
expensive
schemes
when
he
ought
to
be
moving
warily
and
trying
to
consolidate
the
small
success
he
had
had
all
his
life
he
had
thought
in
millions
where
the
prudent
man
would
have
been
content
with
hundreds
an
inexhaustible
fount
of
optimism
bubbled
eternally
within
him
that
rather
ambitious
she
said
yes
ambitious
sort
of
cove
your
brother
quite
the
i
shall
have
to
talk
to
him
said
sally
decidedly
she
was
annoyed
with
fillmore
everything
had
been
going
so
beautifully
with
everybody
peaceful
and
happy
and
prosperous
and
no
anxiety
anywhere
till
he
had
spoiled
things
now
she
would
have
to
start
worrying
again
of
course
argued
ginger
there
money
in
revues
over
in
london
fellows
make
pots
out
of
sally
shook
her
head
it
wo
do
she
said
and
i
tell
you
another
thing
that
wo
do
this
armchair
of
course
it
ought
to
be
over
by
the
window
you
can
see
that
yourself
ca
absolutely
said
ginger
patiently
preparing
for
action
once
more
sally
anxiety
with
regard
to
her
ebullient
brother
was
not
lessened
by
the
receipt
shortly
afterwards
of
a
telegram
from
miss
winch
in
chicago
have
you
been
feeding
fillmore
meat
the
telegram
ran
and
while
sally
could
not
have
claimed
that
she
completely
understood
it
there
was
a
sinister
suggestion
about
the
message
which
decided
her
to
wait
no
longer
before
making
investigations
she
tore
herself
away
from
the
joys
of
furnishing
and
went
round
to
the
headquarters
of
the
fillmore
nicholas
theatrical
enterprises
managing
director
fillmore
nicholas
without
delay
ginger
she
discovered
on
arrival
was
absent
from
his
customary
post
his
place
in
the
outer
office
being
taken
by
a
lad
of
tender
years
and
pimply
exterior
who
thawed
and
cast
off
a
proud
reserve
on
hearing
sally
name
and
told
her
to
walk
right
in
sally
walked
right
in
and
found
fillmore
with
his
feet
on
an
untidy
desk
studying
what
appeared
to
be
ah
sally
he
said
in
the
distrait
tired
voice
which
speaks
of
vast
preoccupations
prosperity
was
still
putting
in
its
silent
deadly
work
on
the
hope
of
the
american
theatre
what
even
at
as
late
an
epoch
as
the
return
from
detroit
had
been
merely
a
smooth
fullness
around
the
angle
of
the
jaw
was
now
frankly
and
without
disguise
a
double
chin
he
was
wearing
a
new
waistcoat
and
it
was
unbuttoned
i
am
rather
busy
he
went
on
always
glad
to
see
you
but
i
am
rather
busy
i
have
a
hundred
things
to
attend
well
attend
to
me
that
only
make
a
hundred
and
one
fill
all
this
i
hear
about
a
revue
fillmore
looked
as
like
a
small
boy
caught
in
the
act
of
stealing
jam
as
it
is
possible
for
a
great
theatrical
manager
to
look
he
had
been
wondering
in
his
darker
moments
what
sally
would
say
about
that
project
when
she
heard
of
it
and
he
had
hoped
that
she
would
not
hear
of
it
until
all
the
preparations
were
so
complete
that
interference
would
be
impossible
he
was
extremely
fond
of
sally
but
there
was
he
knew
a
lamentable
vein
of
caution
in
her
which
might
lead
her
to
criticize
and
how
can
your
man
of
affairs
carry
on
if
women
are
buzzing
round
criticizing
all
the
time
he
picked
up
a
pen
and
put
it
down
buttoned
his
waistcoat
and
unbuttoned
it
and
scratched
his
ear
with
one
of
the
oh
yes
the
revue
it
no
good
saying
yes
you
know
perfectly
well
it
a
crazy
really
these
business
matters
this
interference
i
do
want
to
run
your
affairs
for
you
fill
but
that
money
of
mine
does
make
me
a
sort
of
partner
i
suppose
and
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
raise
a
loud
yell
of
agony
when
i
see
you
risking
it
on
a
pardon
me
said
fillmore
loftily
looking
happier
let
me
explain
women
never
understand
business
matters
your
money
is
tied
up
exclusively
in
primrose
way
which
as
you
know
is
a
tremendous
success
you
have
nothing
whatever
to
worry
about
as
regards
any
new
production
i
may
i
not
worrying
about
the
money
i
worrying
about
a
tolerant
smile
played
about
the
lower
slopes
of
fillmore
face
do
be
alarmed
about
me
i
all
you
are
all
right
you
no
business
when
you
only
just
got
started
as
a
manager
to
be
rushing
into
an
enormous
production
like
this
you
ca
afford
my
dear
child
as
i
said
before
women
can
not
understand
these
things
a
man
in
my
position
can
always
command
money
for
a
new
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
found
somebody
silly
enough
to
put
up
money
certainly
i
do
know
that
there
is
any
secret
about
it
your
friend
carmyle
has
taken
an
interest
in
some
of
my
forthcoming
what
sally
had
been
disturbed
before
but
she
was
aghast
now
this
was
something
she
had
never
anticipated
bruce
carmyle
seemed
to
be
creeping
into
her
life
like
an
advancing
tide
there
appeared
to
be
no
eluding
him
wherever
she
turned
there
he
was
and
she
could
do
nothing
but
rage
impotently
the
situation
was
becoming
impossible
fillmore
misinterpreted
the
note
of
dismay
in
her
voice
it
quite
all
right
he
assured
her
he
a
very
rich
man
large
private
means
besides
his
big
income
even
if
anything
goes
wrong
it
is
that
it
the
hopelessness
of
explaining
to
fillmore
stopped
sally
and
while
she
was
chafing
at
this
new
complication
which
had
come
to
upset
the
orderly
routine
of
her
life
there
was
an
outburst
of
voices
in
the
other
office
ginger
understudy
seemed
to
be
endeavouring
to
convince
somebody
that
the
big
chief
was
engaged
and
not
to
be
intruded
upon
in
this
he
was
unsuccessful
for
the
door
opened
tempestuously
and
miss
winch
sailed
in
fillmore
you
poor
nut
said
miss
winch
for
though
she
might
wrap
up
her
meaning
somewhat
obscurely
in
her
telegraphic
communications
when
it
came
to
the
spoken
word
she
was
directness
itself
stop
picking
straws
in
your
hair
and
listen
to
me
you
dippy
the
last
time
sally
had
seen
fillmore
fiancée
she
had
been
impressed
by
her
imperturbable
calm
miss
winch
in
detroit
had
seemed
a
girl
whom
nothing
could
ruffle
that
she
had
lapsed
now
from
this
serene
placidity
struck
sally
as
ominous
slightly
though
she
knew
her
she
felt
that
it
could
be
no
ordinary
happening
that
had
so
animated
her
ah
here
you
are
said
fillmore
he
had
started
to
his
feet
indignantly
at
the
opening
of
the
door
like
a
lion
bearded
in
its
den
but
calm
had
returned
when
he
saw
who
the
intruder
was
yes
here
i
am
miss
winch
dropped
despairingly
into
a
and
endeavoured
to
restore
herself
with
a
stick
of
fillmore
darling
you
the
sweetest
thing
on
earth
and
i
love
you
but
on
present
form
you
could
just
walk
straight
into
bloomingdale
and
they
give
you
the
royal
my
dear
girl
what
do
you
think
demanded
miss
winch
turning
to
sally
i
just
been
telling
him
said
sally
welcoming
this
ally
i
think
it
absurd
at
this
stage
of
things
for
him
to
put
on
an
enormous
revue
revue
miss
winch
stopped
in
the
act
of
gnawing
her
gum
what
revue
she
flung
up
her
arms
i
shall
have
to
swallow
this
gum
she
said
you
ca
chew
with
your
head
going
round
are
you
putting
on
a
revue
too
fillmore
was
buttoning
and
unbuttoning
his
waistcoat
he
had
a
hounded
look
certainly
certainly
he
replied
in
a
tone
of
some
feverishness
i
wish
you
girls
would
leave
me
to
manage
dippy
said
miss
winch
once
more
telegraphic
address
she
swivelled
round
to
sally
again
say
listen
this
boy
must
be
stopped
we
must
form
a
gang
in
his
best
interests
and
get
him
put
away
what
do
you
think
he
proposes
doing
i
give
you
three
guesses
oh
what
the
use
you
never
hit
it
this
poor
wandering
lad
has
got
it
all
fixed
up
to
star
me
me
in
a
new
show
fillmore
removed
a
hand
from
his
waistcoat
buttons
and
waved
it
protestingly
i
have
used
my
own
judgment
yes
sir
proceeded
miss
winch
riding
over
the
interruption
what
he
planning
to
spring
on
an
unsuspicious
public
i
sitting
peacefully
in
my
room
at
the
hotel
in
chicago
pronging
a
few
worth
of
scrambled
eggs
and
reading
the
morning
paper
when
the
telephone
rings
gentleman
below
would
like
to
see
me
oh
ask
him
to
wait
business
of
flinging
on
a
few
clothes
down
in
elevator
bright
sunrise
effects
in
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
the
gentleman
had
a
head
of
red
hair
which
had
to
be
seen
to
be
believed
explained
miss
winch
lit
up
the
lobby
management
had
switched
off
all
the
electrics
for
sake
of
economy
an
englishman
he
was
nice
fellow
named
oh
is
ginger
in
chicago
said
sally
i
wondered
why
he
was
on
his
little
chair
in
the
outer
office
i
sent
kemp
to
chicago
said
fillmore
to
have
a
look
at
the
show
it
is
my
policy
if
i
am
unable
to
pay
periodical
visits
myself
to
send
a
representative
save
it
up
for
the
long
winter
evenings
advised
miss
winch
cutting
in
on
this
statement
of
managerial
tactics
mr
kemp
may
have
been
there
to
look
at
the
show
but
his
chief
reason
for
coming
was
to
tell
me
to
beat
it
back
to
new
york
to
enter
into
my
kingdom
fillmore
wanted
me
on
the
spot
he
told
me
so
that
i
could
sit
around
in
this
office
here
interviewing
my
supporting
company
me
can
you
or
can
you
not
inquired
miss
winch
frankly
tie
it
well
sally
hesitated
do
say
it
i
know
it
just
as
well
as
you
do
it
too
sad
for
you
persist
in
underestimating
your
abilities
gladys
said
fillmore
reproachfully
i
have
had
a
certain
amount
of
experience
in
theatrical
matters
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
acting
and
i
assure
you
that
as
a
you
miss
winch
rose
swiftly
from
her
seat
kissed
fillmore
energetically
and
sat
down
again
she
produced
another
stick
of
then
shook
her
head
and
replaced
it
in
her
bag
you
a
darling
old
thing
to
talk
like
that
she
said
and
i
hate
to
wake
you
out
of
your
daydreams
but
honestly
fillmore
dear
do
just
step
out
of
the
padded
cell
for
one
moment
and
listen
to
reason
i
know
exactly
what
has
been
passing
in
your
poor
disordered
bean
you
took
elsa
doland
out
of
a
minor
part
and
made
her
a
star
overnight
she
goes
to
chicago
and
the
critics
and
everybody
else
rave
about
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
said
to
sally
with
enthusiasm
for
hers
was
an
honest
and
generous
nature
you
ca
realize
not
having
seen
her
play
there
what
an
amazing
hit
she
has
made
she
really
is
a
sensation
everybody
says
she
going
to
be
the
biggest
thing
on
record
very
well
then
what
does
fillmore
do
the
poor
fish
claps
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
cries
an
idea
i
done
it
before
i
do
it
again
i
the
fellow
who
can
make
a
star
out
of
anything
and
he
picks
on
me
my
dear
girl
now
the
flaw
in
the
scheme
is
this
elsa
is
a
genius
and
if
he
made
her
a
star
somebody
else
would
have
done
but
little
gladys
something
else
she
turned
to
sally
you
seen
me
in
action
and
let
me
tell
you
you
seen
me
at
my
best
give
me
a
maid
part
with
a
tray
to
carry
on
in
act
one
and
a
couple
of
madam
in
act
two
and
i
there
ellen
terry
has
anything
on
me
when
it
comes
to
saying
madam
and
i
willing
to
back
myself
for
gold
notes
or
lima
beans
against
sarah
bernhardt
as
a
but
there
i
finish
that
lets
me
out
and
anybody
who
thinks
otherwise
is
going
to
lose
a
lot
of
money
between
ourselves
the
only
thing
i
can
do
really
well
is
to
cook
my
dear
gladys
cried
fillmore
revolted
i
a
cook
and
i
do
mind
notifying
the
world
to
that
effect
i
can
cook
a
chicken
casserole
so
that
you
would
leave
home
and
mother
for
it
also
my
english
one
of
these
days
i
take
an
afternoon
off
and
assemble
one
for
you
you
be
surprised
but
acting
no
i
ca
do
it
and
i
do
want
to
do
it
i
only
went
on
the
stage
for
fun
and
my
idea
of
fun
is
to
plough
through
a
star
part
with
all
the
critics
waving
their
axes
in
the
front
row
and
me
knowing
all
the
time
that
it
taking
money
out
of
fillmore
bankroll
that
ought
to
be
going
towards
buying
the
little
home
with
stationary
well
that
that
fillmore
old
darling
i
thought
just
mention
sally
could
not
help
being
sorry
for
fillmore
he
was
sitting
with
his
chin
on
his
hands
staring
moodily
before
him
napoleon
at
elba
it
was
plain
that
this
project
of
taking
miss
winch
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
hurling
her
to
the
heights
had
been
very
near
his
heart
if
that
how
you
feel
he
said
in
a
stricken
voice
there
is
nothing
more
to
oh
yes
there
is
we
will
now
talk
about
this
revue
of
yours
off
fillmore
bounded
to
his
feet
he
thumped
the
desk
with
a
fist
a
man
can
stand
just
so
much
it
is
not
off
great
heavens
it
too
much
i
will
not
put
up
with
this
interference
with
my
business
concerns
i
will
not
be
tied
and
hampered
here
am
i
a
man
of
broad
vision
and
and
broad
vision
i
form
my
plans
my
plans
i
form
them
i
shape
my
schemes
and
what
happens
a
horde
of
girls
flock
into
my
private
office
while
i
am
endeavouring
to
concentrate
and
concentrate
i
wo
stand
it
advice
yes
interference
no
i
i
i
and
kindly
remember
that
the
door
closed
with
a
bang
a
fainter
detonation
announced
the
whirlwind
passage
through
the
outer
office
footsteps
died
away
down
the
corridor
sally
looked
at
miss
winch
stunned
a
roused
and
militant
fillmore
was
new
to
her
miss
winch
took
out
the
stick
of
again
and
unwrapped
it
is
he
cute
she
said
i
hope
he
does
get
the
soft
kind
she
murmured
chewing
reflectively
the
soft
he
be
back
soon
with
a
box
of
candy
explained
miss
winch
and
he
will
get
that
sloshy
creamy
sort
though
i
keep
telling
him
i
like
the
other
well
one
thing
certain
fillmore
got
it
up
his
nose
beginning
to
hop
about
and
sing
in
the
sunlight
it
going
to
be
hard
work
to
get
that
boy
down
to
earth
miss
winch
heaved
a
gentle
sigh
i
should
like
him
to
have
enough
left
in
the
old
stocking
to
pay
the
first
year
rent
when
the
wedding
bells
ring
she
bit
meditatively
on
her
not
she
said
that
it
matters
be
just
as
happy
in
two
rooms
and
a
kitchenette
so
long
as
fillmore
was
there
you
no
notion
how
dippy
i
am
about
her
freckled
face
glowed
he
grows
on
me
like
a
darned
drug
and
the
funny
thing
is
that
i
keep
right
on
admiring
him
though
i
can
see
all
the
while
that
the
most
perfect
chump
he
is
a
chump
you
know
that
what
i
love
about
him
that
and
the
way
his
ears
wiggle
when
he
gets
excited
chumps
always
make
the
best
husbands
when
you
marry
sally
grab
a
chump
tap
his
forehead
first
and
if
it
rings
solid
do
hesitate
all
the
unhappy
marriages
come
from
the
husband
having
brains
what
good
are
brains
to
a
man
they
only
unsettle
she
broke
off
and
scrutinized
sally
closely
say
what
do
you
do
with
your
skin
she
spoke
with
solemn
earnestness
which
made
sally
laugh
what
do
i
do
with
my
skin
i
just
carry
it
around
with
well
said
miss
winch
enviously
i
wish
i
could
train
my
darned
fool
of
a
complexion
to
get
that
way
freckles
are
the
devil
when
i
was
eight
i
had
the
finest
collection
in
the
middle
west
and
i
been
adding
to
it
right
along
some
folks
say
cure
mine
lap
up
all
i
give
and
ask
for
more
there
only
one
way
of
getting
rid
of
freckles
and
that
is
to
saw
the
head
off
at
the
but
why
do
you
want
to
get
rid
of
them
why
because
a
sensitive
girl
anxious
to
retain
her
future
love
does
enjoy
going
about
looking
like
something
out
of
a
dime
how
absurd
fillmore
worships
did
he
tell
you
so
asked
miss
winch
eagerly
not
in
so
many
words
but
you
can
see
it
in
his
well
he
certainly
asked
me
to
marry
him
knowing
all
about
them
i
will
say
that
and
what
more
i
do
think
feminine
loveliness
means
much
to
fillmore
or
he
never
have
picked
on
me
still
it
is
calculated
to
give
a
girl
a
jar
you
must
admit
when
she
picks
up
a
magazine
and
reads
an
advertisement
of
a
beginning
husband
is
growing
cold
to
you
can
you
blame
him
have
you
really
tried
to
cure
those
unsightly
blemishes
meaning
what
i
got
still
i
have
noticed
fillmore
growing
cold
to
me
so
maybe
it
all
it
was
a
subdued
sally
who
received
ginger
when
he
called
at
her
apartment
a
few
days
later
on
his
return
from
chicago
it
seemed
to
her
thinking
over
the
recent
scene
that
matters
were
even
worse
than
she
had
feared
this
absurd
revue
which
she
had
looked
on
as
a
mere
isolated
outbreak
of
foolishness
was
it
would
appear
only
a
specimen
of
the
sort
of
thing
her
misguided
brother
proposed
to
do
a
sample
selected
at
random
from
a
wholesale
lot
of
frantic
schemes
fillmore
there
was
no
longer
any
room
for
doubt
was
preparing
to
express
his
great
soul
on
a
vast
scale
and
she
could
not
dissuade
him
a
humiliating
thought
she
had
grown
so
accustomed
through
the
years
to
being
the
dominating
mind
that
this
revolt
from
her
authority
made
her
feel
helpless
and
inadequate
her
was
shaken
and
bruce
carmyle
was
financing
him
it
was
illogical
but
sally
could
not
help
feeling
that
when
she
had
not
the
optimism
to
say
if
he
lost
his
money
she
would
somehow
be
under
an
obligation
to
him
as
if
the
disaster
had
been
her
fault
she
disliked
with
a
intensity
the
thought
of
being
under
an
obligation
to
carmyle
ginger
said
he
had
looked
in
to
inspect
the
furniture
on
the
chance
that
sally
might
want
it
shifted
again
but
sally
had
no
criticisms
to
make
on
that
subject
weightier
matters
occupied
her
mind
she
sat
ginger
down
in
the
armchair
and
started
to
pour
out
her
troubles
it
soothed
her
to
talk
to
him
in
a
world
which
had
somehow
become
chaotic
again
after
an
all
too
brief
period
of
peace
he
was
solid
and
consoling
i
should
worry
observed
ginger
with
calm
when
she
had
finished
drawing
for
him
the
picture
of
a
fillmore
rampant
against
a
background
of
expensive
revues
sally
nearly
shook
him
it
all
very
well
to
tell
me
not
to
worry
she
cried
how
can
i
help
worrying
fillmore
simply
a
baby
and
he
just
playing
the
fool
he
has
lost
his
head
completely
and
i
ca
stop
him
that
is
the
awful
part
of
it
i
used
to
be
able
to
look
him
in
the
eye
and
he
would
wag
his
tail
and
crawl
back
into
his
basket
but
now
i
seem
to
have
no
influence
at
all
over
him
he
just
snorts
and
goes
on
running
round
in
circles
breathing
ginger
did
not
abandon
his
attempts
to
indicate
the
silver
lining
i
think
you
are
making
too
much
of
all
this
you
know
i
mean
to
say
it
quite
likely
he
found
some
mug
what
i
mean
is
it
just
possible
that
your
brother
is
standing
the
entire
racket
himself
perhaps
some
rich
johnnie
has
breezed
along
with
a
pot
of
money
it
often
happens
like
that
you
know
you
read
in
the
paper
that
some
manager
or
other
is
putting
on
some
show
or
other
when
really
the
chap
who
actually
supplying
the
pieces
of
eight
is
some
anonymous
lad
in
the
that
is
just
what
has
happened
and
it
makes
it
worse
than
ever
fillmore
tells
me
that
your
cousin
carmyle
is
providing
the
this
did
interest
ginger
he
sat
up
with
a
jerk
oh
i
say
he
exclaimed
yes
said
sally
still
agitated
but
pleased
that
she
had
at
last
shaken
him
out
of
his
trying
attitude
of
detachment
ginger
was
scowling
that
a
bit
off
he
observed
i
think
so
i
do
like
nor
do
do
you
know
what
i
think
said
ginger
ever
a
man
of
plain
speech
and
a
reckless
plunger
into
delicate
subjects
the
blighter
in
love
with
sally
flushed
after
examining
the
evidence
before
her
she
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
in
the
privacy
of
her
thoughts
but
it
embarrassed
her
to
hear
the
thing
put
into
bald
words
i
know
bruce
continued
ginger
and
believe
me
he
is
the
sort
of
cove
to
take
any
kind
of
flutter
without
a
jolly
good
motive
of
course
he
got
tons
of
money
his
old
guvnor
was
the
carmyle
of
carmyle
brent
coal
mines
up
in
wales
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
suppose
he
must
have
left
bruce
something
like
half
a
million
no
need
for
the
fellow
to
have
worked
at
all
if
he
had
wanted
to
as
far
as
having
the
stuff
goes
he
in
a
position
to
back
all
the
shows
he
wants
to
but
the
point
is
it
right
out
of
his
line
he
does
do
that
sort
of
thing
not
a
drop
of
sporting
blood
in
the
chap
why
i
known
him
stick
the
whole
family
on
to
me
just
because
it
got
noised
about
that
i
dropped
a
couple
of
quid
on
the
grand
national
if
he
really
brought
himself
to
the
point
of
shelling
out
on
a
risky
proposition
like
a
show
it
means
something
take
my
word
for
it
and
i
do
see
what
else
it
can
mean
except
well
i
mean
to
say
is
it
likely
that
doing
it
simply
to
make
your
brother
look
on
him
as
a
good
egg
and
a
pal
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
no
it
not
agreed
sally
but
do
let
talk
about
it
any
more
tell
me
all
about
your
trip
to
all
right
but
returning
to
this
binge
for
a
moment
i
do
see
how
it
matters
to
you
one
way
or
the
other
you
engaged
to
another
fellow
and
when
bruce
rolls
up
and
says
about
it
you
simply
to
tell
him
that
the
shot
is
on
the
board
and
will
he
kindly
melt
away
then
you
hand
him
his
hat
and
out
he
sally
gave
a
troubled
laugh
you
think
that
simple
do
you
i
suppose
you
imagine
that
a
girl
enjoys
that
sort
of
thing
oh
what
the
use
of
talking
about
it
horrible
and
no
amount
of
arguing
will
make
it
anything
else
do
change
the
subject
how
did
you
like
chicago
oh
all
right
rather
a
grubby
sort
of
so
i
always
heard
but
you
ought
not
to
mind
that
being
a
oh
i
did
mind
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
rather
a
good
time
saw
one
or
two
shows
you
know
got
in
on
my
face
as
your
representative
which
was
all
to
the
good
by
the
way
it
rummy
how
you
run
into
people
when
you
move
about
is
it
you
talk
as
if
you
had
been
dashing
about
the
streets
with
your
eyes
shut
did
you
meet
somebody
you
knew
chap
i
had
seen
for
years
was
at
school
with
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
fellow
named
foster
but
i
expect
you
know
him
too
do
you
by
name
at
any
rate
he
wrote
your
brother
sally
heart
jumped
oh
did
you
meet
gerald
foster
ran
into
him
one
night
at
the
and
you
were
really
at
school
with
him
yes
he
was
in
the
footer
team
with
me
my
last
was
he
a
too
asked
sally
dimpling
ginger
looked
shocked
you
do
have
two
in
a
team
he
said
pained
at
this
ignorance
on
a
vital
matter
the
is
the
half
who
works
the
scrum
and
yes
you
told
me
that
at
roville
what
was
gerald
foster
then
a
six
and
or
something
he
was
a
said
ginger
with
a
gravity
befitting
his
theme
rather
fast
with
a
fairly
decent
swerve
but
he
would
not
learn
to
give
the
reverse
pass
inside
to
the
ghastly
said
sally
if
said
ginger
earnestly
a
wing
bottled
up
by
his
wing
and
the
back
the
only
thing
he
can
do
if
he
does
want
to
be
bundled
into
touch
is
to
give
the
reverse
i
know
said
sally
if
i
thought
that
once
i
thought
it
a
hundred
times
how
nice
it
must
have
been
for
you
meeting
again
i
suppose
you
had
all
sorts
of
things
to
talk
about
ginger
shook
his
head
not
such
a
frightful
lot
we
were
never
very
thick
you
see
this
chap
foster
was
by
way
of
being
a
bit
of
a
what
a
tick
explained
ginger
a
rotter
he
was
pretty
generally
barred
at
school
personally
i
never
had
any
use
for
him
at
sally
stiffened
she
had
liked
ginger
up
to
that
moment
and
later
on
no
doubt
she
would
resume
her
liking
for
him
but
in
the
immediate
moment
which
followed
these
words
she
found
herself
regarding
him
with
stormy
hostility
how
dare
he
sit
there
saying
things
like
that
about
gerald
ginger
who
was
lighting
a
cigarette
without
a
care
in
the
world
proceeded
to
develop
his
theme
it
a
rummy
thing
about
school
generally
if
a
fellow
good
at
games
in
the
cricket
team
or
the
footer
team
and
so
forth
he
can
hardly
help
being
fairly
popular
but
this
blighter
foster
somehow
nobody
seemed
very
keen
on
him
of
course
he
had
a
few
of
his
own
pals
but
most
of
the
chaps
rather
gave
him
a
miss
it
may
have
been
because
he
was
a
bit
sidey
had
rather
an
edge
on
him
you
know
personally
the
reason
i
barred
him
was
because
he
was
straight
you
did
notice
it
if
you
were
thrown
a
goodish
bit
with
him
of
course
but
he
and
i
were
in
the
same
house
and
sally
managed
to
control
her
voice
though
it
shook
a
little
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
said
and
her
tone
would
have
warned
him
had
he
been
less
occupied
that
foster
is
a
great
friend
of
but
ginger
was
intent
on
the
lighting
of
his
cigarette
a
delicate
operation
with
the
breeze
blowing
in
through
the
open
window
his
head
was
bent
and
he
had
formed
his
hands
into
a
protective
framework
which
half
hid
his
face
if
you
take
my
tip
he
mumbled
you
drop
him
he
a
wrong
he
spoke
with
the
drawl
of
preoccupation
and
sally
could
keep
the
conflagration
under
no
longer
she
was
aflame
from
head
to
foot
it
may
interest
you
to
know
she
said
shooting
the
words
out
like
bullets
from
between
clenched
teeth
that
gerald
foster
is
the
man
i
am
engaged
to
ginger
head
came
slowly
up
from
his
cupped
hands
amazement
was
in
his
eyes
and
a
sort
of
horror
the
cigarette
hung
limply
from
his
mouth
he
did
not
speak
but
sat
looking
at
her
dazed
then
the
match
burnt
his
fingers
and
he
dropped
it
with
a
start
the
sharp
sting
of
it
seemed
to
wake
him
he
blinked
you
joking
he
said
feebly
there
was
a
note
of
wistfulness
in
his
voice
it
is
true
sally
kicked
the
leg
of
her
chair
irritably
she
read
insolent
disapproval
into
the
words
he
was
daring
to
criticize
of
course
it
true
but
a
look
of
hopeless
misery
came
into
ginger
pleasant
face
he
hesitated
then
with
the
air
of
a
man
bracing
himself
to
a
dreadful
but
unavoidable
ordeal
he
went
on
he
spoke
gruffly
and
his
eyes
which
had
been
fixed
on
sally
wandered
down
to
the
match
on
the
carpet
it
was
still
glowing
and
mechanically
he
put
a
foot
on
it
foster
married
he
said
shortly
he
was
married
the
day
before
i
left
it
seemed
to
ginger
that
in
the
silence
which
followed
brooding
over
the
room
like
a
living
presence
even
the
noises
in
the
street
had
ceased
as
though
what
he
had
said
had
been
a
spell
cutting
sally
and
himself
off
from
the
outer
world
only
the
little
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
ticked
ticked
ticked
like
a
heart
beating
fast
he
stared
straight
before
him
conscious
of
a
strange
rigidity
he
felt
incapable
of
movement
as
he
had
sometimes
felt
in
nightmares
and
not
for
all
the
wealth
of
america
could
he
have
raised
his
eyes
just
then
to
sally
face
he
could
see
her
hands
they
had
tightened
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
the
knuckles
were
white
he
was
blaming
himself
bitterly
now
for
his
oafish
clumsiness
in
blurting
out
the
news
so
abruptly
and
yet
curiously
in
his
remorse
there
was
something
of
elation
never
before
had
he
felt
so
near
to
her
it
was
as
though
a
barrier
that
had
been
between
them
had
fallen
something
moved
it
was
sally
hand
slowly
relaxing
the
fingers
loosened
their
grip
tightened
again
then
as
if
reluctantly
relaxed
once
more
the
blood
flowed
back
your
cigarette
ginger
started
violently
her
voice
coming
suddenly
out
of
the
silence
had
struck
him
like
a
blow
oh
thanks
he
forced
himself
to
light
another
match
it
sputtered
noisily
in
the
stillness
he
blew
it
out
and
the
uncanny
quiet
fell
again
ginger
drew
at
his
cigarette
mechanically
for
an
instant
he
had
seen
sally
face
and
the
chin
tilted
like
a
flag
flying
over
a
stricken
field
his
mood
changed
all
his
emotions
had
crystallized
into
a
dull
futile
rage
a
helpless
fury
directed
at
a
man
a
thousand
miles
away
sally
spoke
again
her
voice
sounded
small
and
far
off
an
odd
flatness
in
it
married
ginger
threw
his
cigarette
out
of
the
window
he
was
shocked
to
find
that
he
was
smoking
nothing
could
have
been
farther
from
his
intention
than
to
smoke
he
nodded
whom
has
he
married
ginger
coughed
something
was
sticking
in
his
throat
and
speech
was
difficult
a
girl
called
oh
elsa
doland
elsa
sally
drummed
with
her
fingers
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
oh
elsa
doland
there
was
silence
again
the
little
clock
ticked
fussily
on
the
mantelpiece
out
in
the
street
automobile
horns
were
blowing
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
came
faintly
the
rumble
of
an
elevated
train
familiar
sounds
but
they
came
to
sally
now
with
a
curious
unreal
sense
of
novelty
she
felt
as
though
she
had
been
projected
into
another
world
where
everything
was
new
and
strange
and
horrible
everything
except
ginger
about
him
in
the
mere
sight
of
him
there
was
something
known
and
heartening
suddenly
she
became
aware
that
she
was
feeling
that
ginger
was
behaving
extremely
well
she
seemed
to
have
been
taken
out
of
herself
and
to
be
regarding
the
scene
from
outside
regarding
it
coolly
and
critically
and
it
was
plain
to
her
that
ginger
in
this
upheaval
of
all
things
was
bearing
himself
perfectly
he
had
attempted
no
banal
words
of
sympathy
he
had
said
nothing
and
he
was
not
looking
at
her
and
sally
felt
that
sympathy
just
now
would
be
torture
and
that
she
could
not
have
borne
to
be
looked
at
ginger
was
wonderful
in
that
curious
detached
spirit
that
had
come
upon
her
she
examined
him
impartially
and
gratitude
welled
up
from
the
very
depths
of
her
there
he
sat
saying
nothing
and
doing
nothing
as
if
he
knew
that
all
she
needed
the
only
thing
that
could
keep
her
sane
in
this
world
of
nightmare
was
the
sight
of
that
dear
flaming
head
of
his
that
made
her
feel
that
the
world
had
not
slipped
away
from
her
altogether
ginger
did
not
move
the
room
had
grown
almost
dark
now
a
spear
of
light
from
a
street
lamp
shone
in
through
the
window
sally
got
up
abruptly
slowly
gradually
inch
by
inch
the
great
suffocating
cloud
which
had
been
crushing
her
had
lifted
she
felt
alive
again
her
black
hour
had
gone
and
she
was
back
in
the
world
of
living
things
once
more
she
was
afire
with
a
fierce
tearing
pain
that
tormented
her
almost
beyond
endurance
but
dimly
she
sensed
the
fact
that
she
had
passed
through
something
that
was
worse
than
pain
and
with
ginger
stolid
presence
to
aid
her
had
passed
triumphantly
go
and
have
dinner
ginger
she
said
you
must
be
ginger
came
to
life
like
a
courtier
in
the
palace
of
the
sleeping
beauty
he
shook
himself
and
rose
stiffly
from
his
chair
oh
no
he
said
not
a
bit
sally
switched
on
the
light
and
set
him
blinking
she
could
bear
to
be
looked
at
now
go
and
dine
she
said
dine
lavishly
and
luxuriously
certainly
earned
her
voice
faltered
for
a
moment
she
held
out
her
hand
ginger
she
said
shakily
i
ginger
you
a
when
he
had
gone
sally
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
then
she
dried
her
eyes
in
a
manner
there
miss
nicholas
she
said
you
could
have
done
that
an
hour
ago
we
will
now
boil
you
an
egg
for
your
dinner
and
see
how
that
suits
you
chapter
xi
sally
runs
away
if
ginger
kemp
had
been
asked
to
enumerate
his
good
qualities
it
is
not
probable
that
he
would
have
drawn
up
a
very
lengthy
list
he
might
have
started
by
claiming
for
himself
the
virtue
of
meaning
well
but
after
that
he
would
have
had
to
chew
the
pencil
in
prolonged
meditation
and
even
if
he
could
eventually
have
added
one
or
two
further
items
to
the
catalogue
tact
and
delicacy
of
feeling
would
not
have
been
among
them
yet
by
staying
away
from
sally
during
the
next
few
days
he
showed
considerable
delicacy
it
was
not
easy
to
stay
away
from
her
but
he
forced
himself
to
do
so
he
argued
from
his
own
tastes
and
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
in
times
of
travail
solitude
was
what
the
sufferer
most
desired
in
his
time
he
too
had
had
what
he
would
have
described
as
nasty
jars
and
on
these
occasions
all
he
had
asked
was
to
be
allowed
to
sit
and
think
things
over
and
fight
his
battle
out
by
himself
by
saturday
however
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
some
form
of
action
might
now
be
taken
saturday
was
rather
a
good
day
for
picking
up
the
threads
again
he
had
not
to
go
to
the
office
and
what
was
still
more
to
the
point
he
had
just
drawn
his
week
salary
meecher
had
deftly
taken
a
certain
amount
of
this
off
him
but
enough
remained
to
enable
him
to
attempt
consolation
on
a
fairly
princely
scale
there
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
judicious
move
the
idea
of
hiring
a
car
and
taking
sally
out
to
dinner
at
one
of
the
he
had
heard
about
up
the
boston
post
road
he
examined
the
scheme
the
more
he
looked
at
it
the
better
it
seemed
he
was
helped
to
this
decision
by
the
extraordinary
perfection
of
the
weather
the
weather
of
late
had
been
a
revelation
to
ginger
it
was
his
first
experience
of
america
indian
summer
and
it
had
quite
overcome
him
as
he
stood
on
the
roof
of
meecher
establishment
on
the
saturday
morning
thrilled
by
the
velvet
wonder
of
the
sunshine
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
only
possible
way
of
passing
such
a
day
was
to
take
sally
for
a
ride
in
an
open
car
the
maison
meecher
was
a
lofty
building
on
one
of
the
at
the
lower
end
of
the
avenue
from
its
roof
after
you
had
worked
your
way
through
the
groves
of
washing
which
hung
limply
from
the
you
could
see
many
things
of
interest
to
the
left
lay
washington
square
full
of
somnolent
italians
and
children
to
the
right
was
a
spectacle
which
never
failed
to
intrigue
ginger
the
high
of
a
cunard
liner
moving
slowly
down
the
river
sticking
up
over
the
as
if
the
boat
was
travelling
down
ninth
avenue
there
were
four
of
these
funnels
causing
ginger
to
deduce
the
mauritania
as
the
boat
on
which
he
had
come
over
from
england
the
mauritania
had
a
sentimental
interest
for
him
he
stood
watching
her
stately
progress
till
the
higher
buildings
farther
down
the
town
shut
her
from
his
sight
then
picked
his
way
through
the
washing
and
went
down
to
his
room
to
get
his
hat
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
was
in
the
of
sally
apartment
house
gazing
with
disgust
at
the
back
of
his
cousin
carmyle
who
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
gentleman
in
overalls
no
prospector
singing
his
way
through
the
mojave
desert
and
suddenly
finding
himself
confronted
by
a
rattlesnake
could
have
experienced
so
abrupt
a
change
of
mood
as
did
ginger
at
this
revolting
spectacle
even
in
their
native
piccadilly
it
had
been
unpleasant
to
run
into
carmyle
to
find
him
here
now
was
nothing
short
of
nauseating
only
one
thing
could
have
brought
him
to
this
place
obviously
he
must
have
come
to
see
sally
and
with
a
sudden
sinking
of
the
heart
ginger
remembered
the
shiny
expensive
automobile
which
he
had
seen
waiting
at
the
door
he
it
was
clear
was
not
the
only
person
to
whom
the
idea
had
occurred
of
taking
sally
for
a
drive
on
this
golden
day
he
was
still
standing
there
when
carmyle
swung
round
with
a
frown
on
his
dark
face
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
had
not
found
the
conversation
entertaining
the
sight
of
ginger
plainly
did
nothing
to
lighten
his
gloom
hullo
he
said
hullo
said
ginger
uncomfortable
silence
followed
these
civilities
have
you
come
to
see
miss
nicholas
why
she
is
here
said
carmyle
and
the
fact
that
he
had
found
someone
to
share
the
bad
news
seemed
to
cheer
him
a
little
not
here
no
apparently
bruce
carmyle
scowl
betrayed
that
resentment
which
a
man
can
not
but
feel
at
the
unreasonableness
of
others
apparently
for
some
extraordinary
reason
she
has
taken
it
into
her
head
to
dash
over
to
ginger
tottered
the
unexpectedness
of
the
blow
was
crushing
he
followed
his
cousin
out
into
the
sunshine
in
a
sort
of
dream
bruce
carmyle
was
addressing
the
driver
of
the
expensive
automobile
i
find
i
shall
not
want
the
car
you
can
take
it
back
to
the
the
chauffeur
a
moody
man
opened
one
eye
and
spat
cautiously
it
was
the
way
rockefeller
would
have
spat
when
approaching
the
crisis
of
some
delicate
financial
negotiation
you
have
to
pay
just
the
same
he
observed
opening
his
other
eye
to
lend
emphasis
to
the
words
of
course
i
shall
pay
snapped
carmyle
irritably
how
much
is
it
money
passed
the
car
rolled
off
gone
to
england
said
ginger
dizzily
yes
gone
to
but
why
how
the
devil
do
i
know
why
bruce
carmyle
would
have
found
his
best
friend
trying
at
this
moment
gaping
ginger
gave
him
almost
a
physical
pain
all
i
know
is
what
the
janitor
told
me
that
she
sailed
on
the
mauretania
this
the
tragic
irony
of
this
overcame
ginger
that
he
should
have
stood
on
the
roof
calmly
watching
the
boat
down
the
river
he
nodded
absently
to
carmyle
and
walked
off
he
had
no
further
remarks
to
make
the
warmth
had
gone
out
of
the
sunshine
and
all
interest
had
departed
from
his
life
he
felt
dull
listless
at
a
loose
end
not
even
the
thought
that
his
cousin
a
careful
man
with
his
money
had
had
to
pay
a
day
hire
for
a
car
which
he
could
not
use
brought
him
any
balm
he
loafed
aimlessly
about
the
streets
he
wandered
in
the
park
and
out
again
the
park
bored
him
the
streets
bored
him
the
whole
city
bored
him
a
city
without
sally
in
it
was
a
drab
futile
city
and
nothing
that
the
sun
could
do
to
brighten
it
could
make
it
otherwise
night
came
at
last
and
with
it
a
letter
it
was
the
first
even
passably
pleasant
thing
that
had
happened
to
ginger
in
the
whole
of
this
dreary
and
unprofitable
day
for
the
envelope
bore
the
crest
of
the
good
ship
mauretania
he
snatched
it
covetously
from
the
and
carried
it
upstairs
to
his
room
very
few
of
the
rooms
at
meecher
struck
any
note
of
luxury
meecher
was
not
one
of
your
fashionable
interior
decorators
she
considered
that
when
she
had
added
a
morris
chair
to
the
essentials
which
make
up
a
bedroom
she
had
gone
as
far
in
the
direction
of
pomp
as
any
guest
at
per
could
expect
her
to
go
as
a
rule
the
severity
of
his
surroundings
afflicted
ginger
with
a
touch
of
gloom
when
he
went
to
bed
but
such
is
the
magic
of
a
letter
from
the
right
person
he
was
uplifted
and
almost
gay
there
are
moments
when
even
illuminated
texts
over
the
can
not
wholly
quell
us
there
was
nothing
of
haste
and
much
of
ceremony
in
ginger
method
of
approaching
the
perusal
of
his
correspondence
he
bore
himself
after
the
manner
of
a
small
boy
in
the
presence
of
unexpected
gloating
for
awhile
before
embarking
on
the
treat
anxious
to
make
it
last
out
his
first
move
was
to
feel
in
the
of
his
coat
and
produce
the
photograph
of
sally
which
he
had
feloniously
removed
from
her
apartment
at
this
he
looked
long
and
earnestly
before
propping
it
up
within
easy
reach
against
his
basin
to
be
handy
if
required
for
purposes
of
reference
he
then
took
off
his
coat
collar
and
shoes
filled
and
lit
a
pipe
placed
pouch
and
matches
on
the
arm
of
the
morris
chair
and
drew
that
chair
up
so
that
he
could
sit
with
his
feet
on
the
bed
having
manoeuvred
himself
into
a
position
of
ease
he
lit
his
pipe
again
and
took
up
the
letter
he
looked
at
the
crest
the
handwriting
of
the
address
and
the
postmark
he
weighed
it
in
his
hand
it
was
a
bulky
letter
he
took
sally
photograph
from
the
and
scrutinized
it
once
more
then
he
lit
his
pipe
again
and
finally
wriggling
himself
into
the
depths
of
the
chair
opened
the
envelope
ginger
having
read
so
far
ginger
found
it
necessary
to
take
up
the
photograph
and
study
it
with
an
even
greater
intentness
than
before
he
gazed
at
it
for
many
minutes
then
laid
it
down
and
lit
his
pipe
again
then
he
went
on
with
the
letter
ginger
dear
i
afraid
this
address
is
going
to
give
you
rather
a
shock
and
i
feeling
very
guilty
i
running
away
and
i
have
even
stopped
to
say
i
ca
help
it
i
know
it
weak
and
cowardly
but
i
simply
ca
help
it
i
stood
it
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
i
saw
that
it
was
no
good
thank
you
for
leaving
me
alone
and
not
coming
round
to
see
me
nobody
else
but
you
would
have
done
that
but
then
nobody
ever
has
been
or
ever
could
be
so
understanding
as
you
ginger
found
himself
compelled
at
this
point
to
look
at
the
photograph
again
there
was
too
much
in
new
york
to
remind
me
that
the
worst
of
being
happy
in
a
place
when
things
go
wrong
you
find
there
are
too
many
ghosts
about
i
just
could
stand
it
i
tried
but
i
could
going
away
to
get
cured
if
i
can
faucitt
is
over
in
england
and
when
i
went
down
to
meecher
for
my
letters
i
found
one
from
him
his
brother
is
dead
you
know
and
he
has
inherited
of
all
things
a
fashionable
place
in
regent
street
his
brother
was
laurette
et
cie
i
suppose
he
will
sell
the
business
later
on
but
just
at
present
the
poor
old
dear
is
apparently
quite
bewildered
and
that
does
seem
to
have
occurred
to
him
he
kept
saying
in
his
letter
how
much
he
wished
i
was
with
him
to
help
him
and
i
was
tempted
and
ran
anything
to
get
away
from
the
ghosts
and
have
something
to
do
i
suppose
i
shall
feel
much
better
in
england
but
at
least
every
street
corner
wo
have
associations
do
ever
be
happy
anywhere
ginger
it
too
big
a
risk
much
too
big
a
risk
there
was
a
letter
from
elsa
doland
too
bubbling
over
with
affection
we
had
always
been
tremendous
friends
of
course
she
never
knew
anything
about
my
being
engaged
to
gerald
i
lent
fillmore
the
money
to
buy
that
piece
which
gave
elsa
her
first
big
chance
and
so
she
very
grateful
she
says
if
ever
she
gets
the
opportunity
of
doing
me
a
good
turn
are
things
muddled
and
there
was
a
letter
from
gerald
i
was
expecting
one
of
course
but
what
would
you
have
done
ginger
would
you
have
read
it
i
sat
with
it
in
front
of
me
for
an
hour
i
should
think
just
looking
at
the
envelope
and
then
you
see
what
was
the
use
i
could
guess
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
be
in
it
and
reading
it
would
only
have
hurt
a
lot
more
the
thing
was
done
so
why
bother
about
explanations
what
good
are
explanations
anyway
they
do
help
they
do
do
anything
i
burned
it
ginger
the
last
letter
i
shall
ever
get
from
him
i
made
a
bonfire
on
the
bathroom
floor
and
it
smouldered
and
went
brown
and
then
flared
a
little
and
every
now
and
then
i
lit
another
match
and
kept
it
burning
and
at
last
it
was
just
black
ashes
and
a
stain
on
the
tiles
just
a
mess
ginger
burn
this
letter
too
i
pouring
out
all
the
poison
to
you
hoping
it
will
make
me
feel
better
you
do
mind
do
you
but
i
know
you
do
if
ever
anybody
had
a
real
pal
it
a
dreadful
thing
fascination
ginger
it
grips
you
and
you
are
helpless
one
can
be
so
sensible
and
reasonable
about
other
love
affairs
when
i
was
working
at
the
dance
place
i
told
you
about
there
was
a
girl
who
fell
in
love
with
the
most
awful
little
beast
he
had
a
mean
mouth
and
shiny
black
hair
brushed
straight
back
and
anybody
would
have
seen
what
he
was
but
this
girl
would
listen
to
a
word
i
talked
to
her
by
the
hour
it
makes
me
smile
now
when
i
think
how
sensible
and
i
was
but
she
would
listen
in
some
mysterious
way
this
was
the
man
she
wanted
and
of
course
everything
happened
that
one
knew
would
happen
if
one
could
manage
one
own
life
as
well
as
one
can
manage
other
people
if
all
this
wretched
thing
of
mine
had
happened
to
some
other
girl
how
beautifully
i
could
have
proved
that
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
and
that
a
man
who
could
behave
as
gerald
has
done
was
worth
worrying
about
i
can
just
hear
myself
but
you
see
whatever
he
has
done
gerald
is
still
gerald
and
sally
is
still
sally
and
however
much
i
argue
i
ca
get
away
from
that
all
i
can
do
is
to
come
howling
to
my
redheaded
pal
when
i
know
just
as
well
as
he
does
that
a
girl
of
any
spirit
would
be
dignified
and
keep
her
troubles
to
herself
and
be
much
too
proud
to
let
anyone
know
that
she
was
hurt
proud
that
the
real
trouble
ginger
my
pride
has
been
battered
and
chopped
up
and
broken
into
as
many
pieces
as
you
broke
stick
what
pitiful
creatures
we
are
girls
i
mean
at
least
i
suppose
a
good
many
girls
are
like
me
if
gerald
had
died
and
i
had
lost
him
that
way
i
know
quite
well
i
should
be
feeling
as
i
do
now
i
should
have
been
but
it
would
have
been
the
same
my
pride
that
is
hurt
i
have
always
been
a
bossy
cocksure
little
creature
swaggering
about
the
world
like
an
english
sparrow
and
now
i
paying
for
it
oh
ginger
i
paying
for
it
i
wonder
if
running
away
is
going
to
do
me
any
good
at
all
perhaps
if
faucitt
has
some
real
hard
work
for
me
to
do
of
course
i
know
exactly
how
all
this
has
come
about
elsa
pretty
and
attractive
but
the
point
is
that
she
is
a
success
and
as
a
success
she
appeals
to
gerald
weakest
side
he
worships
success
she
is
going
to
have
a
marvellous
career
and
she
can
help
gerald
on
in
his
he
can
write
plays
for
her
to
star
in
what
have
i
to
offer
against
that
yes
i
know
it
grovelling
and
contemptible
of
me
to
say
that
ginger
i
ought
to
be
above
it
ought
i
talking
as
if
i
were
competing
for
some
prize
but
i
have
any
pride
left
oh
well
there
i
poured
it
all
out
and
i
really
do
feel
a
little
better
just
for
the
moment
it
wo
last
of
course
but
even
a
minute
is
something
ginger
dear
i
sha
see
you
for
ever
so
long
even
if
we
ever
do
meet
again
but
you
try
to
remember
that
i
thinking
of
you
a
whole
lot
wo
you
i
feel
responsible
for
you
you
my
baby
you
got
started
now
and
you
only
to
stick
to
it
please
please
please
do
a
hash
of
it
i
never
did
find
that
photograph
of
me
that
we
were
looking
for
that
afternoon
in
the
apartment
or
i
would
send
it
to
you
then
you
could
have
kept
it
on
your
mantelpiece
and
whenever
you
felt
inclined
to
make
a
hash
of
anything
i
would
have
caught
your
eye
sternly
and
you
would
have
pulled
up
ginger
i
shall
have
to
stop
now
the
mail
is
just
closing
always
your
pal
wherever
i
ginger
laid
the
letter
down
and
a
little
sound
escaped
him
that
was
half
a
sigh
half
an
oath
he
was
wondering
whether
even
now
some
desirable
end
might
not
be
achieved
by
going
to
chicago
and
breaking
gerald
foster
neck
abandoning
this
scheme
as
impracticable
and
not
being
able
to
think
of
anything
else
to
do
he
his
pipe
and
started
to
read
the
letter
again
chapter
xii
some
letters
for
ginger
laurette
et
cie
regent
street
london
england
january
dear
ginger
i
feeling
better
as
it
three
months
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
no
doubt
you
will
say
to
yourself
that
i
would
be
a
poor
creature
if
i
was
i
suppose
one
ought
to
be
able
to
get
over
anything
in
three
months
unfortunately
i
afraid
i
have
quite
succeeded
in
doing
that
but
at
least
i
have
managed
to
get
my
troubles
stowed
away
in
the
cellar
and
i
not
dragging
them
out
and
looking
at
them
all
the
time
that
something
is
it
i
ought
to
give
you
all
my
impressions
of
london
i
suppose
but
grown
so
used
to
the
place
that
i
do
think
i
have
any
now
i
seem
to
have
been
here
years
and
years
you
will
see
by
the
address
that
faucitt
has
not
yet
sold
his
inheritance
he
expects
to
do
so
very
soon
he
tells
me
there
is
a
man
with
whiskers
and
a
keen
eye
whom
he
is
always
lunching
with
and
i
think
big
deals
are
in
progress
poor
dear
he
is
crazy
to
get
away
into
the
country
and
settle
down
and
grow
ducks
and
things
london
has
disappointed
him
it
is
not
the
place
it
used
to
be
until
quite
lately
when
he
grew
resigned
he
used
to
wander
about
in
a
disconsolate
sort
of
way
trying
to
locate
the
landmarks
of
his
youth
he
has
not
been
in
england
for
nearly
thirty
years
the
trouble
is
it
seems
that
about
once
in
every
thirty
years
a
sort
of
craze
for
change
comes
over
london
and
they
paint
a
red
instead
of
blue
and
that
upsets
the
returned
exile
dreadfully
faucitt
feels
like
rip
van
winkle
his
first
shock
was
when
he
found
that
the
empire
was
a
theatre
now
instead
of
a
then
he
was
told
that
another
the
tivoli
had
been
pulled
down
altogether
and
when
on
top
of
that
he
went
to
look
at
the
baker
shop
in
rupert
street
over
which
he
had
lodgings
in
the
eighties
and
discovered
that
it
had
been
turned
into
a
dressmaker
he
grew
very
melancholy
and
only
cheered
up
a
little
when
a
lovely
magenta
fog
came
on
and
showed
him
that
some
things
were
still
going
along
as
in
the
good
old
days
i
am
kept
quite
busy
at
laurette
et
thank
goodness
not
being
a
french
scholar
like
you
do
you
remember
jules
i
thought
at
first
that
cie
was
the
name
of
the
junior
partner
and
looked
forward
to
meeting
him
miss
nicholas
shake
hands
with
cie
one
of
your
greatest
i
hold
down
the
female
equivalent
of
your
job
at
the
fillmore
nicholas
theatrical
enterprises
that
is
to
say
i
a
sort
of
woman
i
hang
around
and
sidle
up
to
the
customers
when
they
come
in
and
say
chawming
weather
moddom
which
is
usually
a
black
lie
and
pass
them
on
to
the
staff
who
do
the
actual
work
i
should
mind
going
on
like
this
for
the
next
few
years
but
faucitt
is
determined
to
sell
i
do
know
if
you
are
like
that
but
every
other
englishman
i
ever
met
seems
to
have
an
ambition
to
own
a
house
and
lot
in
loamshire
or
hants
or
salop
or
somewhere
their
one
object
in
life
is
to
make
some
money
and
buy
back
the
old
place
which
was
sold
of
course
at
the
end
of
act
one
to
pay
the
heir
gambling
debts
faucitt
when
he
was
a
small
boy
used
to
live
in
a
little
village
in
gloucestershire
near
a
place
called
cirencester
at
least
it
is
it
called
cissister
which
i
bet
you
did
know
and
after
forgetting
about
it
for
fifty
years
he
has
suddenly
been
bitten
by
the
desire
to
end
his
days
there
surrounded
by
pigs
and
chickens
he
took
me
down
to
see
the
place
the
other
day
oh
ginger
this
english
country
why
any
of
you
ever
live
in
towns
i
ca
think
old
old
grey
stone
houses
with
yellow
haystacks
and
lovely
squelchy
muddy
lanes
and
great
fat
trees
and
blue
hills
in
the
distance
the
peace
of
it
if
ever
i
sell
my
soul
i
shall
insist
on
the
devil
giving
me
at
least
forty
years
in
some
english
country
place
in
exchange
perhaps
you
will
think
from
all
this
that
i
am
too
much
occupied
to
remember
your
existence
just
to
show
how
interested
i
am
in
you
let
me
tell
you
that
when
i
was
reading
the
paper
a
week
ago
i
happened
to
see
the
headline
international
it
did
seem
to
mean
anything
at
first
and
then
i
suddenly
recollected
this
was
the
thing
you
had
once
been
a
snip
for
so
i
went
down
to
a
place
called
twickenham
where
this
football
game
was
to
be
to
see
the
sort
of
thing
you
used
to
do
before
i
took
charge
of
you
and
made
you
a
respectable
man
there
was
an
enormous
crowd
there
and
i
was
nearly
squeezed
to
death
but
i
bore
it
for
your
sake
i
found
out
that
the
english
team
were
the
ones
wearing
white
shirts
and
that
the
ones
in
red
were
the
welsh
i
said
to
the
man
next
to
me
after
he
had
finished
yelling
himself
black
in
the
face
could
you
kindly
inform
me
which
is
the
english
and
just
at
that
moment
the
players
came
quite
near
where
i
was
and
about
a
dozen
assassins
in
red
hurled
themselves
violently
on
top
of
a
little
fellow
who
had
just
fallen
on
the
ball
ginger
you
are
well
out
of
it
that
was
the
and
i
gathered
that
that
sort
of
thing
was
a
mere
commonplace
in
his
existence
stopping
a
rush
it
is
called
and
he
is
expected
to
do
it
all
the
time
the
idea
of
you
ever
going
in
for
such
brutal
sports
you
thank
your
stars
that
you
are
safe
on
your
little
stool
in
fillmore
outer
office
and
that
if
anybody
jumps
on
top
of
you
now
you
can
call
a
cop
do
you
mean
to
say
you
really
used
to
do
these
daredevil
feats
you
must
have
hidden
depths
in
you
which
i
have
never
suspected
as
i
was
taking
a
ride
down
piccadilly
the
other
day
on
top
of
a
bus
i
saw
somebody
walking
along
who
seemed
familiar
it
was
carmyle
so
he
back
in
england
again
he
did
see
me
thank
goodness
i
want
to
meet
anybody
just
at
present
who
reminds
me
of
new
york
thanks
for
telling
me
all
the
news
but
please
do
do
it
again
it
makes
me
remember
and
i
do
want
to
it
this
way
ginger
let
me
write
to
you
because
it
really
does
relieve
me
but
do
answer
my
letters
do
you
mind
i
sure
you
understand
so
fillmore
and
gladys
winch
are
married
from
what
i
have
seen
of
her
it
the
best
thing
that
has
ever
happened
to
brother
she
is
a
splendid
girl
i
must
write
to
him
laurette
et
london
march
dear
ginger
i
saw
in
a
sunday
paper
last
week
that
the
primrose
way
had
been
produced
in
new
york
and
was
a
great
success
well
i
very
glad
but
i
do
think
the
papers
ought
to
print
things
like
that
unsettling
next
day
i
did
one
of
those
funny
things
you
do
when
you
feeling
blue
and
lonely
and
a
long
way
away
from
everybody
i
called
at
your
club
and
asked
for
you
such
a
nice
old
man
in
uniform
at
the
desk
said
in
a
fatherly
way
that
you
had
been
in
lately
and
he
rather
fancied
you
were
out
of
town
but
would
i
take
a
seat
while
he
inquired
he
then
summoned
a
tiny
boy
also
in
uniform
and
the
child
skipped
off
chanting
mister
kemp
mister
kemp
in
a
shrill
treble
it
gave
me
such
an
odd
feeling
to
hear
your
name
echoing
in
the
distance
i
felt
so
ashamed
for
giving
them
all
that
trouble
and
when
the
boy
came
back
i
slipped
twopence
into
his
palm
which
i
suppose
was
against
all
the
rules
though
he
seemed
to
like
it
faucitt
has
sold
the
business
and
retired
to
the
country
and
i
am
rather
at
a
loose
end
monk
crofton
whatever
that
means
much
middleford
salop
slang
for
shropshire
england
april
dear
ginger
what
the
use
what
is
the
use
i
do
all
i
can
to
get
right
away
from
new
york
and
new
york
comes
after
me
and
tracks
me
down
in
my
a
week
or
so
ago
as
i
was
walking
down
the
strand
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
out
there
came
right
on
top
of
me
who
do
you
think
fillmore
arm
in
arm
with
carmyle
i
could
dodge
in
the
first
place
carmyle
had
seen
me
in
the
second
place
it
is
a
journey
to
dodge
poor
dear
fillmore
now
i
blushed
for
him
ginger
right
there
in
the
strand
i
blushed
for
him
in
my
worst
dreams
i
had
never
pictured
him
so
enormous
upon
what
meat
doth
this
our
fillmore
feed
that
he
is
grown
so
great
poor
gladys
when
she
looks
at
him
she
must
feel
like
a
bigamist
apparently
fillmore
is
still
full
of
big
schemes
for
he
talked
airily
about
buying
all
sorts
of
english
plays
he
has
come
over
as
i
suppose
you
know
to
arrange
about
putting
on
the
primrose
way
over
here
he
is
staying
at
the
savoy
and
they
took
me
off
there
to
lunch
whooping
joyfully
as
over
a
strayed
lamb
it
was
the
worst
thing
that
could
possibly
have
happened
to
me
fillmore
talked
broadway
without
a
pause
till
by
the
time
he
had
worked
his
way
past
the
french
pastry
and
was
lolling
back
breathing
a
little
stertorously
waiting
for
the
coffee
and
liqueurs
he
had
got
me
so
homesick
that
if
it
had
been
that
i
did
want
to
make
a
public
exhibition
of
myself
i
should
have
broken
down
and
howled
it
was
crazy
of
me
ever
to
go
near
the
savoy
of
course
it
simply
an
annex
to
broadway
there
were
americans
at
every
table
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
i
might
just
as
well
have
been
at
the
astor
well
if
fate
insists
in
bringing
new
york
to
england
for
my
special
discomfiture
i
suppose
i
have
got
to
put
up
with
it
i
just
let
events
take
their
course
and
i
have
been
drifting
ever
since
two
days
ago
i
drifted
here
carmyle
invited
fillmore
he
seems
to
love
fillmore
and
me
to
monk
crofton
and
i
had
even
the
shadow
of
an
excuse
for
refusing
so
i
came
and
i
am
now
sitting
writing
to
you
in
an
enormous
bedroom
with
an
open
fire
and
armchairs
and
every
other
sort
of
luxury
fillmore
is
out
golfing
he
sails
for
new
york
on
saturday
on
the
mauretania
i
am
horrified
to
hear
from
him
that
in
addition
to
all
his
other
big
schemes
he
is
now
promoting
a
fight
for
the
championship
in
jersey
city
and
guaranteeing
enormous
sums
to
both
boxers
it
no
good
arguing
with
him
if
you
do
he
simply
quotes
figures
to
show
the
fortunes
other
people
have
made
out
of
these
things
besides
it
too
late
now
anyway
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
fight
is
going
to
take
place
in
another
week
or
two
all
the
same
it
makes
my
flesh
creep
well
it
no
use
worrying
i
suppose
let
change
the
subject
do
you
know
monk
crofton
probably
you
do
as
i
seem
to
remember
hearing
something
said
about
it
being
a
recent
purchase
carmyle
bought
it
from
some
lord
or
other
who
had
been
losing
money
on
the
stock
exchange
i
hope
you
have
seen
it
anyway
because
i
want
to
describe
it
at
great
length
i
want
to
pour
out
my
soul
about
it
ginger
what
has
england
ever
done
to
deserve
such
paradises
i
thought
in
my
ignorance
that
faucitt
cissister
place
was
pretty
good
but
it
does
even
begin
it
ca
compete
of
course
his
is
just
an
ordinary
country
house
and
this
is
a
seat
monk
crofton
is
the
sort
of
place
they
used
to
write
about
in
the
english
novels
you
know
the
sunset
was
falling
on
the
walls
of
g
castle
in
b
shire
hard
by
the
picturesque
village
of
h
and
not
a
stone
throw
from
the
hamlet
of
j
i
can
imagine
tennyson
maud
living
here
it
is
one
of
the
stately
homes
of
england
how
beautiful
they
stand
and
i
crazy
about
it
you
motor
up
from
the
station
and
after
you
have
gone
about
three
miles
you
turn
in
at
a
big
iron
gate
with
stone
posts
on
each
side
with
stone
beasts
on
them
close
by
the
gate
is
the
cutest
little
house
with
an
old
man
inside
it
who
pops
out
and
touches
his
hat
this
is
only
the
lodge
really
but
you
think
you
have
arrived
so
you
get
all
ready
to
jump
out
and
then
the
car
goes
rolling
on
for
another
fifty
miles
or
so
through
beech
woods
full
of
rabbits
and
open
meadows
with
deer
in
them
finally
just
as
you
think
you
are
going
on
for
ever
you
whizz
round
a
corner
and
there
the
house
you
do
get
a
glimpse
of
it
till
then
because
the
trees
are
too
thick
it
very
large
and
sort
of
low
and
square
with
a
kind
of
tower
at
one
side
and
the
most
fascinating
upper
porch
sort
of
thing
with
battlements
i
suppose
in
the
old
days
you
used
to
stand
on
this
and
drop
molten
lead
on
visitors
heads
wonderful
lawns
all
round
and
shrubberies
and
a
lake
that
you
can
just
see
where
the
ground
dips
beyond
the
fields
of
course
it
too
early
yet
for
them
to
be
out
but
to
the
left
of
the
house
there
a
place
where
there
will
be
about
a
million
roses
when
june
comes
round
and
all
along
the
side
of
the
is
a
high
wall
of
old
red
brick
which
shuts
off
the
kitchen
garden
i
went
exploring
there
this
morning
it
an
enormous
place
with
and
things
and
there
the
cunningest
farm
at
one
end
with
a
stable
yard
full
of
puppies
that
just
tear
the
heart
out
of
you
they
so
sweet
and
a
big
sleepy
cat
which
sits
and
blinks
in
the
sun
and
lets
the
puppies
run
all
over
her
and
there
a
lovely
stillness
and
you
can
hear
everything
growing
and
thrushes
and
blackbirds
oh
ginger
it
heavenly
but
there
a
catch
it
a
case
of
where
every
prospect
pleases
and
only
man
is
at
least
not
exactly
vile
i
suppose
but
terribly
stodgy
i
can
see
now
why
you
could
hit
it
off
with
the
family
because
i
seen
all
they
here
yes
uncle
donald
and
all
of
them
is
it
a
habit
of
your
family
to
collect
in
gangs
or
have
i
just
happened
to
stumble
into
an
accidental
old
home
week
when
i
came
down
to
dinner
the
first
evening
the
was
full
to
bursting
point
not
simply
because
fillmore
was
there
but
because
there
were
uncles
and
aunts
all
over
the
place
i
felt
like
a
small
lion
in
a
den
of
daniels
i
know
exactly
now
what
you
mean
about
the
family
they
look
at
you
of
course
it
all
right
for
me
because
i
am
snowy
white
clear
through
but
i
can
just
imagine
what
it
must
have
been
like
for
you
with
your
permanently
guilty
conscience
you
must
have
had
an
awful
time
by
the
way
it
going
to
be
a
delicate
business
getting
this
letter
through
to
you
rather
like
carrying
the
despatches
through
the
lines
in
a
civil
war
play
you
supposed
to
leave
letters
on
the
table
in
the
hall
and
someone
collects
them
in
the
afternoon
and
takes
them
down
to
the
village
on
a
bicycle
but
if
i
do
that
some
aunt
or
uncle
is
bound
to
see
it
and
i
shall
be
an
object
of
loathing
for
it
is
no
light
matter
my
lad
to
be
caught
having
correspondence
with
a
human
jimpson
weed
like
you
it
would
blast
me
socially
at
least
so
i
gather
from
the
way
they
behaved
when
your
name
came
up
at
dinner
last
night
somebody
mentioned
you
and
the
most
awful
roasting
party
broke
loose
uncle
donald
acting
as
i
said
feebly
that
i
had
met
you
and
had
found
you
part
human
and
there
was
an
awful
silence
till
they
all
started
at
the
same
time
to
show
me
where
i
was
wrong
and
how
cruelly
my
girlish
inexperience
had
deceived
me
a
young
and
innocent
like
me
it
appears
is
absolutely
incapable
of
suspecting
the
true
infamy
of
the
dregs
of
society
you
are
fit
to
speak
to
the
likes
of
me
being
at
the
kindest
estimate
little
more
than
a
blot
on
the
human
race
i
tell
you
this
in
case
you
may
imagine
you
popular
with
the
family
you
not
so
i
shall
have
to
exercise
a
good
deal
of
snaky
craft
in
smuggling
this
letter
through
i
take
it
down
to
the
village
myself
if
i
can
sneak
away
but
it
going
to
be
pretty
difficult
because
for
some
reason
i
seem
to
be
a
centre
of
attraction
except
when
i
take
refuge
in
my
room
hardly
a
moment
passes
without
an
aunt
or
an
uncle
popping
out
and
having
a
cosy
talk
with
me
it
sometimes
seems
as
though
they
were
weighing
me
in
the
balance
well
let
weigh
time
to
dress
for
dinner
now
yours
in
the
balance
sally
you
were
perfectly
right
about
your
uncle
donald
moustache
but
i
do
agree
with
you
that
it
is
more
his
misfortune
than
his
fault
i
think
he
does
it
on
purpose
just
for
the
moment
monk
crofton
much
middleford
salop
england
april
dear
ginger
leaving
here
in
disgrace
hard
cold
looks
from
the
family
strained
silences
uncle
donald
far
from
chummy
you
can
guess
what
has
happened
i
might
have
seen
it
coming
i
can
see
now
that
it
was
in
the
air
all
along
fillmore
knows
nothing
about
it
he
left
just
before
it
happened
i
shall
see
him
very
soon
for
i
have
decided
to
come
back
and
stop
running
away
from
things
any
longer
it
cowardly
to
skulk
about

so
much
better
that
i
believe
i
can
face
the
ghosts
anyway
i
going
to
try

you
almost
as
soon
as
you

i
suppose

will
come

by
the
same
boat
as
me

writing
really
of
course
but
i
have
sneaked
up
to
my
room
to
wait
till

to
take
me
to
the
station
and
it
something
to
do
i
can
hear
muffled
voices
the

talking
me
over

saying
they
never
really
liked
me

well

chapter
xiii
strange
behaviour
of
a
sally
emotions
as
she
sat
in
her
apartment
on
the
morning
of
her
return
to
new
york
resembled
somewhat
those
of
a
swimmer
who
after
wavering
on
a
raw
morning
at
the
brink
of
a
chill
pool
nerves
himself
to
the
plunge
she
was
aching
but
she
knew
that
she
had
done
well
if
she
wanted
happiness
she
must
fight
for
it
and
for
all
these
months
she
had
been
shirking
the
fight
she
had
done
with
wavering
on
the
brink
and
here
she
was
in
ready
for
whatever
might
befall
it
hurt
this
coming
to
grips
she
had
expected
it
to
hurt
but
it
was
a
pain
that
stimulated
not
a
dull
melancholy
that
smothered
she
felt
alive
and
defiant
she
had
finished
unpacking
and
tidying
up
the
next
move
was
certainly
to
go
and
see
ginger
she
had
suddenly
become
aware
that
she
wanted
very
badly
to
see
ginger
his
stolid
friendliness
would
be
a
support
and
a
prop
she
wished
now
that
she
had
sent
him
a
cable
so
that
he
could
have
met
her
at
the
dock
it
had
been
rather
terrible
at
the
dock
the
echoing
customs
sheds
had
sapped
her
valour
and
she
felt
alone
and
forlorn
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
was
surprised
to
find
how
early
it
was
she
could
catch
him
at
the
office
and
make
him
take
her
out
to
lunch
she
put
on
her
hat
and
went
out
the
restless
hand
of
change
always
active
in
new
york
had
not
spared
the
outer
office
of
the
fillmore
nicholas
theatrical
enterprises
in
the
months
of
her
absence
she
was
greeted
on
her
arrival
by
an
entirely
new
and
original
stripling
in
the
place
of
the
one
with
whom
at
her
last
visit
she
had
established
such
cordial
relations
like
his
predecessor
he
was
generously
pimpled
but
there
the
resemblance
stopped
he
was
a
grim
boy
and
his
manner
was
stern
and
suspicious
he
peered
narrowly
at
sally
for
a
moment
as
if
he
had
caught
her
in
the
act
of
purloining
the
office
then
with
no
little
acerbity
desired
her
to
state
her
business
i
want
kemp
said
sally
the
scratched
his
cheek
dourly
with
a
ruler
no
one
would
have
guessed
so
austere
was
his
aspect
that
a
moment
before
her
entrance
he
had
been
trying
to
balance
it
on
his
chin
juggling
the
while
with
a
pair
of
for
impervious
as
he
seemed
to
human
weaknesses
it
was
this
lad
ambition
one
day
to
go
into
vaudeville
what
name
he
said
coldly
nicholas
said
sally
i
am
nicholas
on
a
previous
occasion
when
she
had
made
this
announcement
disastrous
results
had
ensued
but
it
went
well
it
seemed
to
hit
the
like
a
bullet
he
started
convulsively
opened
his
mouth
and
dropped
the
ruler
in
the
interval
of
stooping
and
recovering
it
he
was
able
to
pull
himself
together
he
had
not
been
curious
about
name
what
he
had
wished
was
to
have
the
name
of
the
person
for
whom
she
was
asking
repeated
he
now
perceived
that
he
had
had
a
bit
of
luck
a
wearying
period
of
disappointment
in
the
matter
of
keeping
the
circulating
while
balancing
the
ruler
had
left
him
peevish
and
it
had
been
his
intention
to
work
off
his
on
the
young
visitor
the
discovery
that
it
was
the
boss
sister
who
was
taking
up
his
time
suggested
the
advisability
of
a
radical
change
of
tactics
he
had
stooped
with
a
frown
he
returned
to
the
perpendicular
with
a
smile
that
was
positively
winning
it
was
like
the
sun
suddenly
bursting
through
a
london
fog
will
you
take
a
seat
lady
he
said
with
polished
courtesy
even
unbending
so
far
as
to
reach
out
and
dust
one
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
he
added
that
the
morning
was
a
fine
one
thank
you
said
sally
will
you
tell
him
i
mr
nicholas
is
out
miss
said
the
with
gentlemanly
regret
he
back
in
new
york
but
he
gone
i
do
want
nicholas
i
want
mr
kemp
yes
sorrow
at
his
inability
to
oblige
shone
from
every
on
the
face
do
know
of
anyone
of
that
name
around
here
he
said
apologetically
but
surely
sally
broke
off
suddenly
a
grim
foreboding
had
come
to
her
how
long
have
you
been
here
she
asked
all
day
said
the
with
the
manner
of
a
casablanca
i
mean
how
long
have
you
been
employed
here
just
over
a
month
has
kemp
been
in
the
office
all
that
time
name
new
to
me
lady
does
he
look
like
anything
i
meanter
say
what
he
look
like
he
has
very
red
never
seen
him
in
here
said
the
the
truth
shone
coldly
on
sally
she
blamed
herself
for
ever
having
gone
away
and
told
herself
that
she
might
have
known
what
would
happen
left
to
his
own
resources
the
unhappy
ginger
had
once
more
made
a
hash
of
it
and
this
hash
must
have
been
a
more
notable
and
outstanding
hash
than
any
of
his
previous
efforts
for
surely
fillmore
would
not
lightly
have
dismissed
one
who
had
come
to
him
under
her
special
protection
where
is
nicholas
she
asked
it
seemed
to
her
that
fillmore
was
the
only
possible
source
of
information
did
you
say
he
was
out
really
out
miss
said
the
with
engaging
candour
he
went
off
to
white
plains
in
his
automobile
white
plains
what
for
the
pimpled
stripling
had
now
given
himself
up
wholeheartedly
to
social
usually
he
liked
his
time
to
himself
and
resented
the
intrusion
of
the
outer
world
for
he
who
had
chosen
jugglery
for
his
walk
in
life
must
neglect
no
opportunity
of
practising
but
so
favourable
was
the
impression
which
sally
had
made
on
his
plastic
mind
that
he
was
delighted
to
converse
with
her
as
long
as
she
wished
i
guess
what
happened
is
he
gone
up
to
take
a
look
at
bugs
butler
he
said
whose
butler
said
sally
mystified
the
smiled
a
tolerant
smile
though
an
admirer
of
the
sex
he
was
aware
that
women
were
seldom
hep
to
the
really
important
things
in
life
he
did
not
blame
them
that
was
the
way
they
were
constructed
and
one
simply
had
to
accept
it
bugs
butler
is
training
up
at
white
plains
who
is
bugs
butler
something
of
his
former
bleakness
of
aspect
returned
to
the
sally
question
had
opened
up
a
subject
on
which
he
felt
deeply
ah
he
replied
losing
his
air
of
respectful
deference
as
he
approached
the
topic
who
is
he
that
what
they
all
saying
all
the
wise
guys
who
has
bugs
butler
ever
licked
i
do
know
said
sally
for
he
had
fixed
her
with
a
penetrating
gaze
and
seemed
to
be
pausing
for
a
reply
nor
nobody
else
said
the
stripling
vehemently
a
lot
of
stiffs
out
on
the
coast
that
all
ginks
nobody
has
ever
heard
of
except
cyclone
mullins
and
it
took
that
false
alarm
fifteen
rounds
to
get
a
decision
over
him
the
boss
would
go
and
give
him
a
chance
against
the
champ
but
i
could
have
told
him
that
the
legitimate
contender
was
binns
put
cyclone
mullins
out
in
the
fifth
well
said
the
in
the
overwrought
tone
of
one
chafing
at
human
folly
if
anybody
thinks
bugs
butler
can
last
six
rounds
with
lew
lucas
i
two
bucks
right
here
in
my
vest
pocket
that
says
it
ai
sally
began
to
see
daylight
oh
bugs
butler
is
one
of
the
boxers
in
this
fight
that
my
brother
is
interested
in
that
right
he
going
up
against
the
lightweight
champ
lew
lucas
is
the
lightweight
champ
he
a
bird
yes
said
sally
this
youth
had
a
way
of
looking
at
her
with
his
head
cocked
on
one
side
as
though
he
expected
her
to
say
something
yes
sir
said
the
stripling
with
emphasis
lew
lucas
is
a
hot
sketch
he
used
to
live
on
the
next
street
to
me
he
added
as
clinching
evidence
of
his
hero
prowess
i
seen
his
old
mother
as
close
as
i
am
to
you
say
i
seen
her
a
hundred
times
is
any
stiff
of
a
bugs
butler
going
to
lick
a
fellow
like
that
it
does
seem
you
spoke
it
said
the
lad
crisply
striking
unsuccessfully
at
a
fly
which
had
settled
on
the
there
was
a
pause
sally
started
to
rise
and
there
another
thing
said
the
loath
to
close
the
subject
can
bugs
butler
make
a
hundred
and
ringside
without
being
weak
it
sounds
awfully
they
say
he
the
expert
laughed
satirically
well
what
that
going
to
get
him
the
poor
fish
ca
punch
a
hole
in
a
you
do
seem
to
like
oh
i
nothing
against
him
said
the
magnanimously
only
saying
he
no
licence
to
be
mixing
it
with
lew
sally
got
up
absorbing
as
this
chat
on
current
form
was
more
important
matters
claimed
her
attention
how
shall
i
find
my
brother
when
i
get
to
white
plains
she
asked
oh
anybody
show
you
the
way
to
the
if
you
hurry
there
a
train
you
can
make
thank
you
very
you
he
opened
the
door
for
her
with
an
politeness
which
disuse
had
rendered
a
little
rusty
then
with
an
air
of
getting
back
to
business
after
a
pleasant
but
frivolous
interlude
he
took
up
the
once
more
and
placed
the
ruler
with
nice
care
on
his
upturned
chin
fillmore
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
began
to
sidle
from
the
room
it
was
a
large
room
half
barn
half
gymnasium
athletic
appliances
of
various
kinds
hung
on
the
walls
and
in
the
middle
there
was
a
wide
space
around
which
a
small
crowd
had
distributed
itself
with
an
air
of
expectancy
this
is
a
commercial
age
and
the
days
when
a
prominent
pugilist
training
activities
used
to
be
hidden
from
the
public
gaze
are
over
if
the
public
can
lay
its
hands
on
fifty
cents
it
may
come
and
gaze
its
fill
this
afternoon
plutocrats
to
the
number
of
about
forty
had
assembled
though
not
all
of
these
to
the
regret
of
lester
burrowes
the
manager
of
the
eminent
bugs
butler
had
parted
with
solid
coin
many
of
those
present
were
newspaper
representatives
and
on
the
free
list
writers
who
would
polish
up
butler
somewhat
crude
prognostications
as
to
what
he
proposed
to
do
to
lew
lucas
and
would
report
him
as
saying
i
am
in
really
superb
condition
and
feel
little
apprehension
of
the
issue
and
artists
who
would
depict
him
in
a
state
of
with
feet
several
sizes
too
large
for
any
man
the
reason
for
fillmore
relief
was
that
burrowes
who
was
a
great
talker
and
had
buttonholed
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
had
at
last
had
his
attention
distracted
elsewhere
and
had
gone
off
to
investigate
some
matter
that
called
for
his
personal
handling
leaving
fillmore
free
to
slide
away
to
the
hotel
and
get
a
bite
to
eat
which
he
sorely
needed
the
zeal
which
had
brought
him
to
the
to
inspect
the
final
day
of
butler
preparation
for
the
fight
was
to
take
place
on
the
morrow
had
been
so
great
that
he
had
omitted
to
lunch
before
leaving
new
york
so
fillmore
made
thankfully
for
the
door
and
it
was
at
the
door
that
he
encountered
sally
he
was
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
moment
and
was
not
aware
of
her
presence
till
she
spoke
hallo
fillmore
sally
had
spoken
softly
but
a
dynamite
explosion
could
not
have
shattered
her
brother
composure
with
more
completeness
in
the
leaping
twist
which
brought
him
facing
her
he
rose
a
clear
three
inches
from
the
floor
he
had
a
confused
sensation
as
though
his
nervous
system
had
been
stirred
up
with
a
pole
he
struggled
for
breath
and
moistened
his
lips
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
staring
at
her
continuously
during
the
process
great
men
in
their
moments
of
weakness
are
to
be
pitied
rather
than
scorned
if
ever
a
man
had
an
excuse
for
leaping
like
a
young
ram
fillmore
had
it
he
had
left
sally
not
much
more
than
a
week
ago
in
england
in
shropshire
at
monk
crofton
she
had
said
nothing
of
any
intention
on
her
part
of
leaving
the
country
the
county
or
the
house
yet
here
she
was
in
bugs
butler
at
white
plains
in
the
state
of
new
york
speaking
softly
in
his
ear
without
even
going
through
the
preliminary
of
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
to
advertise
her
presence
no
wonder
that
fillmore
was
startled
and
no
wonder
that
as
he
adjusted
his
faculties
to
the
situation
there
crept
upon
him
a
chill
apprehension
for
fillmore
had
not
been
blind
to
the
significance
of
that
invitation
to
monk
crofton
nowadays
your
wooer
does
not
formally
approach
a
girl
nearest
relative
and
ask
permission
to
pay
his
addresses
but
when
he
invites
her
and
that
nearest
relative
to
his
country
home
and
collects
all
the
rest
of
the
family
to
meet
her
the
thing
may
be
said
to
have
advanced
beyond
the
realms
of
mere
speculation
shrewdly
fillmore
had
deduced
that
bruce
carmyle
was
in
love
with
sally
and
mentally
he
had
joined
their
hands
and
given
them
a
brother
blessing
and
now
it
was
only
too
plain
that
disaster
must
have
occurred
if
the
invitation
could
mean
only
one
thing
so
also
could
sally
presence
at
white
plains
mean
only
one
thing
sally
a
croaking
whisper
was
the
best
he
could
achieve
what
what
did
i
startle
you
i
what
are
you
doing
here
why
are
you
at
monk
crofton
sally
glanced
past
him
at
the
ring
and
the
crowd
around
it
i
decided
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
america
circumstances
arose
which
made
it
pleasanter
to
leave
monk
do
you
mean
to
say
yes
do
let
talk
about
do
you
mean
to
say
persisted
fillmore
that
carmyle
proposed
to
you
and
you
turned
him
down
sally
flushed
i
do
think
it
particularly
nice
to
talk
about
that
sort
of
thing
but
a
feeling
of
desolation
overcame
fillmore
that
conviction
which
saddens
us
at
all
times
of
the
wilful
of
our
fellows
swept
coldly
upon
him
everything
had
been
so
perfect
the
whole
arrangement
so
ideal
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
as
a
possibility
that
sally
might
take
it
into
her
head
to
spoil
it
by
declining
to
play
the
part
allotted
to
her
the
match
was
so
obviously
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
it
was
not
merely
the
suitor
impressive
wealth
that
made
him
hold
this
opinion
though
it
would
be
idle
to
deny
that
the
prospect
of
having
a
claim
on
the
carmyle
had
cast
a
rosy
glamour
over
the
future
as
he
had
envisaged
it
he
honestly
liked
and
respected
the
man
he
appreciated
his
quiet
and
aristocratic
reserve
a
fellow
sensible
withal
just
the
sort
of
husband
a
girl
like
sally
needed
and
now
she
had
ruined
everything
with
the
capricious
perversity
which
so
characterizes
her
otherwise
delightful
sex
she
had
spilled
the
beans
but
why
oh
fill
sally
had
expected
that
realization
of
the
facts
would
produce
these
symptoms
in
him
but
now
that
they
had
presented
themselves
she
was
finding
them
rasping
to
the
nerves
i
should
have
thought
the
reason
was
you
mean
you
do
like
him
i
do
know
whether
i
do
or
not
i
certainly
do
like

say
so

the
imperious
desire

bodily
sustenance

to
compete
successfully
for
fillmore

with
his
spiritual
anguish

go
to
the
hotel
and
talk
it
over

the
hotel
and
give
you
something

eat
you
do
want
anything
to
eat
said
fillmore
incredulously
he
supposed
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
that
there
were
eccentric
people
of
this
sort
but
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
he
had
met
one
of
them
well
run
along
yes
but
i
want
to
talk
he
was
not
the
only
person
who
wanted
to
talk
at
the
moment
a
small
man
of
sporting
exterior
hurried
up
he
wore
what
his
advertisements
would
have
called
a
nobbly
suit
of
checked
tweed
and
in
defiance
of
popular
prejudice
a
brown
bowler
hat
lester
burrowes
having
dealt
with
the
business
which
had
interrupted
their
conversation
a
few
minutes
before
was
anxious
to
resume
his
remarks
on
the
subject
of
the
supreme
excellence
in
every
respect
of
his
young
charge
say
nicholas
you
ai
going
bugs
is
just
getting
ready
to
he
glanced
inquiringly
at
sally
my
sister
burrowes
said
fillmore
faintly
mr
burrowes
is
bugs
butler
how
do
you
do
said
sally
pleased
to
meecher
said
burrowes
say
i
was
just
going
to
the
hotel
to
get
something
to
eat
said
fillmore
burrowes
clutched
at
his
with
a
swoop
and
held
him
with
a
glittering
eye
yes
but
say
lem
me
you
never
seen
this
boy
of
mine
not
when
he
was
feeling
right
believe
me
he
there
he
a
wizard
he
a
hindoo
say
he
been
practising
up
a
left
shift
that
fillmore
eye
met
sally
wanly
and
she
pitied
him
presently
she
would
require
him
to
explain
to
her
how
he
had
dared
to
dismiss
ginger
from
his
employment
and
make
that
explanation
a
good
one
but
in
the
meantime
she
remembered
that
he
was
her
brother
and
was
suffering
he
the
cleverest
lightweight
proceeded
burrowes
fervently
since
joe
gans
i
telling
you
and
i
know
he
can
he
make
a
hundred
and
ringside
without
being
weak
asked
sally
the
effect
of
this
simple
question
on
burrowes
was
stupendous
he
dropped
away
from
fillmore
like
an
exhausted
bivalve
and
his
small
mouth
opened
feebly
it
was
as
if
a
child
had
suddenly
propounded
to
an
eminent
mathematician
some
abstruse
problem
in
the
higher
algebra
females
who
took
an
interest
in
boxing
had
come
into
burrowes
life
before
his
younger
days
when
he
was
a
famous
featherweight
the
first
of
his
three
wives
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
at
the
ringside
during
his
contests
and
urge
him
in
language
of
the
severest
technicality
to
knock
opponents
blocks
off
but
somehow
he
had
not
supposed
from
her
appearance
and
manner
that
sally
was
one
of
the
elect
he
gaped
at
her
and
the
relieved
fillmore
sidled
off
like
a
bird
hopping
from
the
compelling
gaze
of
a
snake
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
was
acting
correctly
in
allowing
his
sister
to
roam
at
large
among
the
somewhat
bohemian
surroundings
of
a
but
the
instinct
of
turned
the
scale
he
had
breakfasted
early
and
if
he
did
not
eat
right
speedily
it
seemed
to
him
that
dissolution
would
set
in
whazzat
said
burrowes
feebly
it
took
him
fifteen
rounds
to
get
a
referee
decision
over
cyclone
mullins
said
sally
severely
and
binns
burrowes
rallies
you
ai
got
it
right
he
protested
say
you
must
believe
what
you
see
in
the
papers
the
referee
was
dead
against
us
and
cyclone
was
down
once
for
all
of
half
a
minute
and
they
would
count
him
out
gee
you
got
to
kill
a
guy
in
some
towns
before
they
give
you
a
decision
at
that
they
could
do
nothing
so
raw
as
make
it
anything
but
a
win
for
my
boy
after
him
leading
by
a
mile
all
the
way
have
you
ever
seen
bugs
sally
had
to
admit
that
she
had
not
had
that
privilege
burrowes
with
growing
excitement
felt
in
his
and
produced
a
which
he
thrust
into
her
hand
that
bugs
he
said
take
a
slant
at
that
and
then
tell
me
if
he
do
look
the
the
photograph
represented
a
young
man
in
the
irreducible
minimum
of
clothing
who
crouched
painfully
as
though
stricken
with
one
of
the
acuter
forms
of
gastritis
i
call
him
over
and
have
him
sign
it
for
you
said
burrowes
before
sally
had
had
time
to
grasp
the
fact
that
this
work
of
art
was
a
gift
and
no
mere
loan
here
bugs
a
youth
enveloped
in
a
who
had
been
talking
to
a
group
of
admirers
near
the
ring
turned
started
languidly
towards
them
then
seeing
sally
quickened
his
pace
he
was
an
admirer
of
the
sex
burrowes
did
the
honours
bugs
this
is
miss
nicholas
come
to
see
you
work
out
i
have
been
telling
her
she
going
to
have
a
and
to
sally
shake
hands
with
bugs
butler
the
coming
lightweight
champion
of
the
butler
photograph
sally
considered
had
flattered
him
he
was
in
the
flesh
a
singularly
repellent
young
man
there
was
a
mean
and
cruel
curve
to
his
lips
and
a
cold
arrogance
in
his
eye
a
something
dangerous
and
sinister
in
the
atmosphere
he
radiated
moreover
she
did
not
like
the
way
he
smirked
at
her
however
she
exerted
herself
to
be
amiable
i
hope
you
are
going
to
win
butler
she
said
the
smile
which
she
forced
as
she
spoke
the
words
removed
the
coming
champion
doubts
though
they
had
never
been
serious
he
was
convinced
now
that
he
had
made
a
hit
he
always
did
he
reflected
with
the
girls
it
was
something
about
him
his
chest
swelled
complacently
beneath
the
you
betcher
he
asserted
briefly
burrows
looked
at
his
watch
time
you
were
starting
the
coming
champion
removed
his
gaze
from
sally
face
into
which
he
had
been
peering
in
a
conquering
manner
and
cast
a
disparaging
glance
at
the
audience
it
was
far
from
being
as
large
as
he
could
have
wished
and
at
least
a
third
of
it
was
composed
of
from
the
newspapers
all
right
he
said
bored
his
languor
left
him
as
his
gaze
fell
on
sally
again
and
his
spirits
revived
somewhat
after
all
small
though
the
numbers
of
spectators
might
be
bright
eyes
would
watch
and
admire
him
i
go
a
couple
of
rounds
with
reddy
for
a
starter
he
said
seen
him
anywheres
he
never
around
when
he
i
fetch
him
said
burrowes
he
back
there
i
going
to
show
that
guy
up
this
afternoon
said
butler
coldly
he
been
getting
too
the
manager
bustled
off
and
bugs
butler
with
a
final
smirk
left
sally
and
dived
under
the
ropes
there
was
a
stir
of
interest
in
the
audience
though
the
newspaper
men
blasé
through
familiarity
exhibited
no
emotion
presently
burrowes
reappeared
shepherding
a
young
man
whose
face
was
hidden
by
the
sweater
which
he
was
pulling
over
his
head
he
was
a
sturdily
built
young
man
the
sweater
moving
from
his
body
revealed
a
good
pair
of
shoulders
a
last
tug
and
the
sweater
was
off
red
hair
flashed
into
view
tousled
and
disordered
and
as
she
saw
it
sally
uttered
an
involuntary
gasp
of
astonishment
which
caused
many
eyes
to
turn
towards
her
and
the
young
man
who
had
been
stooping
to
pick
up
his
gloves
straightened
himself
with
a
jerk
and
stood
staring
at
her
blankly
and
incredulously
his
face
slowly
crimsoning
it
was
the
energetic
burrowes
who
broke
the
spell
come
on
come
on
he
said
impatiently
speed
there
ginger
kemp
started
like
a
awakened
then
recovering
himself
slowly
began
to
pull
on
the
gloves
embarrassment
was
stamped
on
his
agreeable
features
his
face
matched
his
hair
sally
plucked
at
the
little
manager
elbow
he
turned
irritably
but
beamed
in
a
distrait
sort
of
manner
when
he
perceived
the
source
of
the
interruption
who
him
he
said
in
answer
to
sally
whispered
question
he
just
one
of
bugs
but
burrowes
fussy
now
that
the
time
had
come
for
action
interrupted
her
you
excuse
me
miss
but
i
have
to
hold
the
watch
we
must
waste
any
sally
drew
back
she
felt
like
an
infidel
who
intrudes
upon
the
celebration
of
strange
rites
this
was
man
hour
and
women
must
keep
in
the
background
she
had
the
sensation
of
being
very
small
and
yet
very
much
in
the
way
like
a
puppy
who
has
wandered
into
a
church
the
novelty
and
solemnity
of
the
scene
awed
her
she
looked
at
ginger
who
with
averted
gaze
was
fiddling
with
his
clothes
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
ring
he
was
as
removed
from
communication
as
if
he
had
been
in
another
world
she
continued
to
stare
and
ginger
shuffling
his
feet
plucked
at
his
gloves
butler
meanwhile
having
doffed
his
stretched
himself
and
with
leisurely
nonchalance
put
on
a
second
pair
of
gloves
was
filling
in
the
time
with
a
little
shadow
boxing
he
moved
rhythmically
to
and
fro
now
ducking
his
head
now
striking
out
with
his
muffled
hands
and
a
sickening
realization
of
the
man
animal
power
swept
over
sally
and
turned
her
cold
swathed
in
his
bugs
butler
had
conveyed
an
atmosphere
of
dangerousness
in
the
which
showed
up
every
rippling
muscle
he
was
horrible
and
sinister
a
machine
built
for
destruction
a
human
panther
so
he
appeared
to
sally
but
a
stout
and
bulbous
eyed
man
standing
at
her
side
was
not
equally
impressed
obviously
one
of
the
wise
guys
of
whom
her
friend
the
sporting
had
spoken
he
was
frankly
dissatisfied
with
the
exhibition
he
observed
in
a
cavilling
spirit
to
his
companion
yes
he
can
do
that
all
right
just
like
i
can
if
i
ai
got
a
partner
to
get
in
the
way
but
one
good
wallop
and
then
watch
his
friend
also
plainly
a
guy
of
established
wisdom
assented
with
a
curt
nod
ah
he
agreed
lew
lucas
said
the
first
wise
guy
is
just
as
shifty
and
he
can
ah
said
the
second
wise
guy
just
because
he
beats
up
a
few
poor
mutts
of
said
the
first
wise
guy
disparagingly
he
thinks
he
ah
said
the
second
wise
guy
as
far
as
sally
could
interpret
these
remarks
the
full
meaning
of
which
was
shrouded
from
her
they
seemed
to
be
reassuring
for
a
comforting
moment
she
ceased
to
regard
ginger
as
a
martyr
waiting
to
be
devoured
by
a
lion
butler
she
gathered
was
not
so
formidable
as
he
appeared
but
her
relief
was
not
to
be
of
course
he
eat
this
gink
went
on
the
first
wise
guy
that
the
thing
he
does
best
killing
his
but
lew
lucas
sally
was
not
interested
in
lew
lucas
that
numbing
fear
had
come
back
to
her
even
these
cognoscenti
little
as
they
esteemed
butler
had
plainly
no
doubts
as
to
what
he
would
do
to
ginger
she
tried
to
tear
herself
away
but
something
stronger
than
her
own
will
kept
her
there
standing
where
she
was
holding
on
to
the
rope
and
staring
forlornly
into
the
ring
ready
bugs
asked
burrowes
the
coming
champion
nodded
carelessly
go
to
it
said
burrowes
ginger
ceased
to
pluck
at
his
gloves
and
advanced
into
the
ring
of
all
the
learned
professions
pugilism
is
the
one
in
which
the
trained
expert
is
most
sharply
divided
from
the
mere
dabbler
in
other
fields
the
amateur
may
occasionally
hope
to
compete
successfully
with
the
man
who
has
made
a
business
of
what
is
to
him
but
a
sport
but
at
boxing
never
and
the
whole
demeanour
of
bugs
butler
showed
that
he
had
laid
this
truth
to
heart
it
would
be
too
little
to
say
that
his
bearing
was
confident
he
comported
himself
with
the
jauntiness
of
an
infant
about
to
demolish
a
noah
ark
with
a
cyclone
mullinses
might
withstand
him
for
fifteen
rounds
where
they
yielded
to
a
binns
in
the
fifth
but
when
it
came
to
beating
up
a
and
an
amateur
at
that
bugs
butler
knew
his
potentialities
he
was
there
forty
ways
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
it
crouching
as
was
his
wont
he
uncoiled
himself
like
a
striking
rattlesnake
and
flicked
ginger
lightly
over
his
guard
then
he
returned
to
his
crouch
and
circled
sinuously
about
the
ring
with
the
amiable
intention
of
showing
the
crowd
payers
and
deadheads
alike
what
real
footwork
was
if
there
was
one
thing
on
which
bugs
butler
prided
himself
it
was
footwork
the
adverb
lightly
is
a
relative
term
and
the
blow
which
had
just
planted
a
dull
patch
on
ginger
cheekbone
affected
those
present
in
different
degrees
ginger
himself
appeared
stolidly
callous
sally
shuddered
to
the
core
of
her
being
and
had
to
hold
more
tightly
to
the
rope
to
support
herself
the
two
wise
guys
mocked
openly
to
the
wise
guys
expert
connoisseurs
of
swat
the
thing
had
appeared
richly
farcical
they
seemed
to
consider
the
blow
administered
to
a
third
party
and
not
to
themselves
hardly
worth
calling
a
blow
at
all
two
more
landing
as
quickly
and
neatly
as
the
first
left
them
equally
cold
call
that
punching
said
the
first
wise
guy
ah
said
the
second
wise
guy
but
butler
if
he
heard
this
criticism
and
it
is
probable
that
he
did
for
the
wise
ones
had
been
restrained
by
no
delicacy
of
feeling
from
raising
their
voices
was
in
no
way
discommoded
by
it
bugs
butler
knew
what
he
was
about
bright
eyes
were
watching
him
and
he
meant
to
give
them
a
treat
the
girls
like
smooth
work
any
roughneck
could
sail
into
a
guy
and
knock
the
daylights
out
of
him
but
how
few
could
be
clever
and
flashy
and
scientific
few
few
indeed
thought
butler
as
he
slid
in
and
led
once
more
something
solid
smote
butler
nose
rocking
him
on
to
his
heels
and
inducing
an
unpleasant
smarting
sensation
about
his
eyes
he
backed
away
and
regarded
ginger
with
astonishment
almost
with
pain
until
this
moment
he
had
scarcely
considered
him
as
an
active
participant
in
the
scene
at
all
and
he
felt
strongly
that
this
sort
of
thing
was
bad
form
it
was
not
being
done
by
a
juster
man
might
have
reflected
that
he
himself
was
to
blame
he
had
undeniably
been
careless
in
the
very
act
of
leading
he
had
allowed
his
eyes
to
flicker
sideways
to
see
how
sally
was
taking
this
exhibition
of
science
and
he
had
paid
the
penalty
nevertheless
he
was
piqued
he
shimmered
about
the
ring
thinking
it
over
and
the
more
he
thought
it
over
the
less
did
he
approve
of
his
young
assistant
conduct
hard
thoughts
towards
ginger
began
to
float
in
his
mind
ginger
too
was
thinking
hard
thoughts
he
had
not
had
an
easy
time
since
he
had
come
to
the
training
camp
but
never
till
had
he
experienced
any
resentment
towards
his
employer
until
this
afternoon
bugs
butler
had
pounded
him
honestly
and
without
malice
and
he
had
gone
through
it
as
the
other
did
phlegmatically
taking
it
as
part
of
the
day
work
but
this
afternoon
there
had
been
a
difference
those
careless
flicks
had
been
an
insult
a
deliberate
offence
the
man
was
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
him
playing
to
the
gallery
and
the
thought
of
who
was
in
that
gallery
inflamed
ginger
past
thought
of
consequences
no
one
not
even
butler
was
more
keenly
alive
than
he
to
the
fact
that
in
a
serious
conflict
with
a
man
who
night
might
be
champion
of
the
world
he
stood
no
chance
whatever
but
he
did
not
intend
to
be
made
an
exhibition
of
in
front
of
sally
without
doing
something
to
hold
his
end
up
he
proposed
to
go
down
with
his
flag
flying
and
in
pursuance
of
this
object
he
dug
butler
heavily
in
the
lower
ribs
with
his
right
causing
that
expert
to
clinch
and
the
two
wise

derision

what
the
hell
think
you
getting
at
demanded
the
aggrieved
pugilist
in
a
heated
whisper
in
ginger
ear
as
they
fell
into
the
embrace
what
the
idea
you
jelly
bean
ginger
maintained
a
pink
silence
his
jaw
was
set
and
the
temper
which
nature
had
bestowed
upon
him
to
go
with
his
hair
had
reached
white
heat
he
dodged
a
vicious
right
which
whizzed
up
at
his
chin
out
of
the
breaking
clinch
and
rushed
a
left
hook
shook
him
but
was
too
high
to
do
more
there
was
rough
work
in
the
far
corner
and
suddenly
with
startling
abruptness
bugs
butler
bothered
by
the
ropes
at
his
back
and
trying
to
ran
into
a
swing
and
fell
time
shouted
the
scandalized
burrowes
utterly
aghast
at
this
frightful
misadventure
in
the
whole
course
of
his
professional
experience
he
could
recall
no
such
devastating
occurrence
the
audience
was
no
less
startled
there
was
audible
gasping
the
newspaper
men
looked
at
each
other
with
a
wild
surmise
and
conjured
up
pleasant
pictures
of
their
sporting
editors
receiving
this
sensational
item
of
news
later
on
over
the
telephone
the
two
wise
guys
continuing
to
pursue
butler
with
their
dislike
emitted
loud
and
raucous
laughs
and
one
of
them
forming
his
hands
into
a
megaphone
urged
the
fallen
warrior
to
go
away
and
get
a
as
for
sally
she
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
fierce
rush
of
happiness
which
swept
away
completely
the
sickening
qualms
of
the
last
few
minutes
her
teeth
were
clenched
and
her
eyes
blazed
with
joyous
excitement
she
looked
at
ginger
yearningly
longing
to
forget
a
gentle
upbringing
and
shout
congratulation
to
him
she
was
proud
of
him
and
mingled
with
the
pride
was
a
curious
feeling
that
was
almost
fear
this
was
not
the
mild
and
amiable
young
man
whom
she
was
wont
to
mother
through
the
difficulties
of
a
world
in
which
he
was
unfitted
to
struggle
for
himself
this
was
a
new
ginger
a
stranger
to
her
on
the
rare
occasions
on
which
he
had
been
knocked
down
in
the
past
it
had
been
bugs
butler
canny
practice
to
pause
for
a
while
and
rest
before
rising
and
continuing
the
argument
but
now
he
was
up
almost
before
he
had
touched
the
boards
and
the
satire
of
the
second
wise
guy
who
had
begun
to
saw
the
air
with
his
hand
and
count
loudly
lost
its
point
it
was
only
too
plain
that
butler
motto
was
that
a
man
may
be
down
but
he
is
never
out
and
indeed
the
had
been
largely
a
stumble
bugs
butler
educated
feet
which
had
carried
him
unscathed
through
so
many
contests
had
for
this
single
occasion
managed
to
get
themselves
crossed
just
as
ginger
blow
landed
and
it
was
to
his
lack
of
balance
rather
than
the
force
of
the
swing
that
his
downfall
had
been
due
time
he
snarled
casting
a
malevolent
at
his
manager
like
hell
it
time
and
in
a
whirlwind
of
flying
gloves
he
flung
himself
upon
ginger
driving
him
across
the
ring
while
burrowes
watch
in
hand
stared
with
dropping
jaw
if
ginger
had
seemed
a
new
ginger
to
sally
still
more
did
this
seem
a
new
bugs
butler
to
burrowes
and
the
manager
groaned
in
spirit
coolness
skill
and
science
these
had
been
the
qualities
in
his
protégé
which
had
always
so
endeared
him
to
lester
burrowes
and
had
so
enriched
their
respective
bank
accounts
and
now
on
the
eve
of
the
most
important
fight
in
his
life
before
an
audience
of
newspaper
men
he
had
thrown
them
all
aside
and
was
making
an
exhibition
of
himself
with
a
common
that
was
the
bitter
blow
to
burrowes
had
this
lapse
into
the
unscientific
primitive
happened
in
a
regular
fight
he
might
have
mourned
and
poured
reproof
into
bug
ear
when
he
got
him
back
in
his
corner
at
the
end
of
the
round
but
he
would
not
have
experienced
this
feeling
of
helpless
horror
the
sort
of
horror
an
elder
of
the
church
might
feel
if
he
saw
his
favourite
bishop
yielding
in
public
to
the
fascination
of
jazz
it
was
the
fact
that
bugs
butler
was
lowering
himself
to
extend
his
powers
against
a
that
shocked
burrowes
there
is
an
etiquette
in
these
things
a
champion
may
batter
his
into
insensibility
if
he
pleases
but
he
must
do
it
with
nonchalance
he
must
not
appear
to
be
really
trying
and
nothing
could
be
more
manifest
than
that
bugs
butler
was
trying
his
whole
fighting
soul
was
in
his
efforts
to
corner
ginger
and
destroy
him
the
battle
was
raging
across
the
ring
and
down
the
ring
and
up
the
ring
and
back
again
yet
always
ginger
like
a
ship
contrived
somehow
to
weather
the
tempest
out
of
the
flurry
of
swinging
arms
he
emerged
time
after
time
bruised
bleeding
but
fighting
hard
for
bugs
butler
fury
was
defeating
its
object
had
he
remained
his
cool
and
scientific
self
he
could
have
demolished
ginger
and
cut
through
his
defence
in
a
matter
of
seconds
but
he
had
lapsed
back
into
the
methods
of
his
unskilled
novitiate
he
swung
and
missed
swung
and
missed
again
struck
but
found
no
vital
spot
and
now
there
was
blood
on
his
face
too
in
some
wild
mêlée
the
sacred
fount
had
been
tapped
and
his
teeth
gleamed
through
a
crimson
mist
the
wise
guys
were
beyond
speech
they
were
leaning
against
one
another
punching
each
other
feebly
in
the
back
one
was
crying
and
then
suddenly
the
end
came
as
swiftly
and
unexpectedly
as
the
thing
had
begun
his
wild
swings
had
tired
bugs
butler
and
with
fatigue
prudence
returned
to
him
his
feet
began
once
more
their
subtle
weaving
in
and
out
twice
his
left
hand
flickered
home
a
quick
feint
a
short
jolting
stab
and
ginger
guard
was
down
and
he
was
swaying
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
his
hands
hanging
and
his
knees
bugs
butler
measured
his
distance
and
sally
shut
her
eyes
chapter

an
old
employee
the
only
real
happiness
we
are
told
is
to
be
obtained
by
bringing
happiness
to
others
bugs
butler
mood
accordingly
when
some
thirty
hours
after
the
painful
episode
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
he
awoke
from
a
state
of
coma
in
the
ring
at
jersey
city
to
discover
that
lew
lucas
had
knocked
him
out
in
the
middle
of
the
third
round
should
have
been
one
of
quiet
contentment
his
inability
to
block
a
short
followed
by
a
right
to
the
point
of
the
jaw
had
ameliorated
quite
a
number
of
existences
lew
lucas
for
one
was
noticeably
pleased
so
were
seconds
one
of
whom
went
so
far
as
to
kiss
him
and
most
of
the
crowd
who
had
betted
heavily
on
the
champion
were
delighted
yet
bugs
butler
did
not
rejoice
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
his
peevish
bearing
struck
a
jarring
note
in
the
general
gaiety
a
heavy
frown
disfigured
his
face
as
he
slouched
from
the
ring
but
the
happiness
which
he
had
spread
went
on
spreading
the
two
wise
guys
who
had
been
unable
to
attend
the
fight
in
person
received
the
result
on
the
ticker
and
exuberantly
proclaimed
themselves
the
richer
by
five
hundred
dollars
the
pimpled
at
the
fillmore
nicholas
theatrical
enterprises
caused
remark
in
the
subway
by
whooping
gleefully
when
he
read
the
news
in
his
morning
paper
for
he
too
had
been
rendered
wealthier
by
the
brittleness
of
butler
chin
and
it
was
with
fierce
satisfaction
that
sally
breakfasting
in
her
little
apartment
informed
herself
through
the
sporting
page
of
the
details
of
the
contender
downfall
she
was
not
a
girl
who
disliked
many
people
but
she
had
acquired
a
lively
distaste
for
bugs
butler
lew
lucas
seemed
a
man
after
her
own
heart
if
he
had
been
a
personal
friend
of
ginger
he
could
not
considering
the
brief
time
at
his
disposal
have
avenged
him
with
more
thoroughness
in
round
one
he
had
done
all
sorts
of
diverting
things
to
butler
left
eye
in
round
two
he
had
continued
the
good
work
on
that
gentleman
body
and
in
round
three
he
had
knocked
him
out
could
anyone
have
done
more
sally
thought
not
and
she
drank
lew
lucas
health
in
a
cup
of
coffee
and
hoped
his
old
mother
was
proud
of
him
the
telephone
bell
rang
at
her
elbow
she
unhooked
the
receiver
hullo
oh
hullo
said
a
voice
ginger
cried
sally
delightedly
i
say
i
awfully
glad
you
back
i
only
got
your
letter
this
morning
found
it
at
the
i
happened
to
look
in
there
and
ginger
interrupted
sally
your
voice
is
music
but
i
want
to
see
you
where
are
you
i
at
a
chemist
shop
across
the
street
i
was
wondering
if
come
here
at
once
i
say
may
i
i
was
just
going
to
you
miserable
creature
why
have
you
been
round
to
see
me
before
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
been
going
about
much
for
the
last
day
you
see
i
know
of
quick
sympathy
came
into
sally
voice
she
gave
a
sidelong
glance
of
approval
and
gratitude
at
the
large
picture
of
lew
lucas
which
beamed
up
at
her
from
the
morning
paper
you
poor
thing
how
are
you
oh
all
right
well
there
was
a
slight
pause
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
i
well
i
not
much
to
look
at
you
you
never
were
stop
talking
and
hurry
i
mean
to
say
sally
hung
up
the
receiver
firmly
she
waited
eagerly
for
some
minutes
and
then
footsteps
came
along
the
passage
they
stopped
at
her
door
and
the
bell
rang
sally
ran
to
the
door
flung
it
open
and
recoiled
in
consternation
oh
ginger
he
had
stated
the
facts
accurately
when
he
had
said
that
he
was
not
much
to
look
at
he
gazed
at
her
devotedly
out
of
an
unblemished
right
eye
but
the
other
was
hidden
altogether
by
a
puffy
swelling
of
dull
purple
a
great
bruise
marred
his
left
and
he
spoke
with
some
difficulty
through
swollen
lips
it
all
right
you
know
he
assured
her
it
is
it
awful
oh
you
poor
darling
she
clenched
her
teeth
viciously
i
wish
he
had
killed
him
eh
i
wish
lew
lucas
or
whatever
his
name
is
had
murdered
him
brute
oh
i
do
know
you
ginger
sense
of
fairness
compelled
him
to
defend
his
late
employer
against
these
harsh
sentiments
he
is
a
bad
sort
of
chap
really
bugs
butler
i
do
you
seriously
mean
to
stand
there
and
tell
me
you
do
loathe
the
creature
oh
he
all
right
see
his
point
of
view
and
all
that
ca
blame
him
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
for
getting
the
wind
up
a
bit
in
the
circs
bit
thick
i
mean
to
say
a
going
at
him
like
that
naturally
he
did
think
it
much
of
a
wheeze
it
was
my
fault
right
along
ought
to
have
done
it
of
course
but
somehow
when
he
started
making
an
ass
of
me
and
i
knew
you
were
looking
on
well
it
seemed
a
good
idea
to
have
a
dash
at
doing
something
on
my
own
no
right
to
of
course
a
is
supposed
sit
down
said
sally
ginger
sat
down
ginger
said
sally
you
too
good
to
oh
i
say
i
believe
if
someone
sandbagged
you
and
stole
your
watch
and
chain
you
say
there
were
faults
on
both
sides
or
something
i
just
a
cat
and
i
say
i
wish
your
beast
of
a
bugs
butler
had
perished
miserably
i
have
gone
and
danced
on
his
grave
but
whatever
made
you
go
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
well
it
seemed
the
only
job
that
was
going
at
the
moment
i
always
done
a
goodish
bit
of
boxing
and
i
was
very
fit
and
so
on
and
it
looked
to
me
rather
an
opening
gave
me
something
to
get
along
with
you
get
paid
quite
fairly
decently
you
know
and
it
rather
a
jolly
life
jolly
being
hammered
about
like
that
oh
you
do
notice
it
much
i
always
enjoyed
scrapping
rather
and
you
see
when
your
brother
gave
me
the
push
sally
uttered
an
exclamation
what
an
extraordinary
thing
it
is
i
went
all
the
way
out
to
white
plains
that
afternoon
to
find
fillmore
and
tackle
him
about
that
and
i
did
say
a
word
about
it
and
i
have
seen
or
been
able
to
get
hold
of
him
no
busy
sort
of
cove
your
why
did
fillmore
let
you
go
let
me
go
oh
you
mean
well
there
was
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
what
happened
oh
it
was
nothing
just
a
what
happened
ginger
disfigured
countenance
betrayed
embarrassment
he
looked
awkwardly
about
the
room
it
not
worth
talking
it
is
worth
talking
about
i
a
right
to
know
it
was
i
who
sent
you
to
fillmore
now
that
said
ginger
was
jolly
decent
of
do
interrupt
i
sent
you
to
fillmore
and
he
had
no
business
to
let
you
go
without
saying
a
word
to
me
what
happened
ginger
twiddled
his
fingers
unhappily
well
it
was
rather
unfortunate
you
see
his
wife
i
do
know
if
you
know
her
of
course
i
know
why
yes
you
would
would
you
your
brother
wife
i
mean
said
ginger
acutely
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
often
find
who
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
one
another
i
know
a
fellow
ginger
said
sally
it
no
good
your
thinking
you
can
get
out
of
telling
me
by
rambling
off
on
other
subjects
i
grim
and
resolute
and
relentless
and
i
mean
to
get
this
story
out
of
you
if
i
have
to
use
a
corkscrew
fillmore
wife
you
were
saying
ginger
came
back
reluctantly
to
the
main
theme
well
she
came
into
the
office
one
morning
and
we
started
fooling
about
fooling
about
well
kind
of
chivvying
each
chivvying
at
least
i
you
were
what
sort
of
chasing
her
a
bit
you
sally
regarded
this
apostle
of
frivolity
with
amazement
what
do
you
mean
ginger
embarrassment
increased
the
thing
was
you
see
she
happened
to
trickle
in
rather
quietly
when
i
happened
to
be
looking
at
something
and
i
did
know
she
was
there
till
she
suddenly
grabbed
it
grabbed
what
the
thing
the
thing
i
happened
to
be
looking
at
she
bagged
it
collared
it
took
it
away
from
me
you
know
and
would
give
it
back
and
generally
started
to
rot
about
a
bit
so
i
rather
began
to
chivvy
her
to
some
extent
and
i
just
caught
her
when
your
brother
happened
to
roll
in
i
suppose
said
ginger
putting
two
and
two
together
he
had
really
come
with
her
to
the
office
and
had
happened
to
hang
back
for
a
minute
or
two
to
talk
to
somebody
or
something
well
of
course
he
was
considerably
fed
to
see
me
apparently
doing
with
his
wife
enough
to
rattle
any
man
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
said
ginger
ever
well
he
did
say
anything
at
the
time
but
a
bit
later
in
the
day
he
called
me
in
and
administered
the
sally
shook
her
head
it
sounds
the
craziest
story
to
me
what
was
it
that
fillmore
took
from
you
oh
just
sally
rapped
the
table
imperiously
ginger
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
her
goaded
visitor
it
was
a
who
of
or
if
you
particular
of
whom
well
you
to
be
absolutely
me
sally
stared
but
i
never
given
you
a
photograph
of
ginger
face
was
a
study
in
scarlet
and
purple
you
did
exactly
give
it
to
me
he
mumbled
when
i
say
give
i
mean
good
gracious
sudden
enlightenment
came
upon
sally
that
photograph
we
were
hunting
for
when
i
first
came
here
had
you
stolen
it
all
the
time
why
yes
i
did
sort
of
pinch
it
you
fraud
you
humbug
and
you
pretended
to
help
me
look
for
she
gazed
at
him
almost
with
respect
i
never
knew
you
were
so
deep
and
snaky
i
discovering
all
sorts
of
new
things
about
there
was
a
brief
silence
ginger
confession
over
seemed
a
trifle
happier
i
hope
you
not
frightfully
sick
about
it
he
said
at
length
it
was
lying
about
you
know
and
i
rather
felt
i
must
have
it
had
the
cheek
to
ask
you
for
it
so
do
apologize
said
sally
cordially
great
compliment
so
i
have
caused
your
downfall
again
have
i
i
certainly
your
evil
genius
ginger
i
beginning
to
feel
like
a
regular
rag
and
a
bone
and
a
hank
of
hair
first
i
egged
you
on
to
insult
your
family
oh
by
the
way
i
want
to
thank
you
about
that
now
that
i
met
your
uncle
donald
i
can
see
how
you
were
i
ruined
your
prospects
there
and
now
my
fatal
beauty
cabinet
size
has
led
to
your
destruction
once
more
it
certainly
up
to
me
to
find
you
another
job
i
can
see
no
really
i
say
you
must
bother
i
shall
be
all
it
my
duty
now
what
is
there
that
you
really
can
do
burglary
of
course
but
it
not
respectable
you
tried
being
a
waiter
and
a
and
a
man
and
none
of
those
seems
to
be
just
right
ca
you
suggest
anything
ginger
shook
his
head
i
shall
wangle
something
i
yes
but
what
it
must
be
something
good
this
time
i
do
want
to
be
walking
along
broadway
and
come
on
you
suddenly
as
a
i
do
want
to
send
for
an
and
find
you
popping
up
my
idea
would
be
to
go
to
my
bank
to
arrange
an
overdraft
and
be
told
the
president
could
give
me
two
minutes
and
crawl
in
humbly
and
find
you
prezzing
away
to
beat
the
band
in
a
big
chair
is
there
anything
in
the
world
that
you
can
do
that
solid
and
substantial
and
will
keep
you
out
of
the
in
your
old
age
think
of
course
if
i
had
a
bit
of
capital
ah
the
business
man
and
what
inquired
sally
would
you
do
morgan
if
you
had
a
bit
of
capital
run
a
said
ginger
promptly
what
a
why
a
thingamajig
for
dogs
you
sally
nodded
oh
a
thingamajig
for
dogs
now
i
understand
you
will
put
things
so
obscurely
at
first
ginger
you
poor
fish
what
are
you
raving
about
what
on
earth
is
a
thingamajig
for
dogs
i
mean
a
sort
of
place
like
fellows
have
breeding
dogs
you
know
and
selling
them
and
winning
prizes
and
all
that
there
are
lots
of
them
oh
a
kennels
yes
a
what
a
weird
mind
you
have
ginger
you
could
say
kennels
at
first
could
you
that
would
have
made
it
difficult
enough
i
suppose
if
anyone
asked
you
where
you
had
your
lunch
you
would
say
at
a
thingamajig
for
mutton
chops
ginger
my
lad
there
is
something
in
this
i
believe
for
the
first
time
in
our
acquaintance
you
have
spoken
something
very
nearly
resembling
a
mouthful
you
wonderful
with
dogs
are
you
i
dashed
keen
on
them
and
i
studied
them
a
bit
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
it
seems
rather
like
swanking
there
is
much
about
dogs
that
i
do
of
course
i
believe
you
a
sort
of
honorary
dog
yourself
i
could
tell
it
by
the
way
you
stopped
that
fight
at
roville
you
plunged
into
a
howling
mass
of
about
a
million
hounds
of
all
species
and
just
whispered
in
their
ears
and
they
stopped
at
once
why
the
more
one
examines
this
the
better
it
looks
i
do
believe
it
the
one
thing
you
could
help
making
a
success
of
it
very
paying
is
it
works
out
at
about
a
hundred
per
cent
on
the
original
outlay
i
been
a
hundred
per
cent
that
sounds
too
much
like
something
of
for
comfort
let
say
and
be
conservative
ginger
you
have
hit
it
say
no
more
you
shall
be
the
dog
king
the
biggest
thingamajigger
for
dogs
in
the
country
but
how
do
you
start
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
while
i
was
up
at
white
plains
i
ran
into
a
cove
who
had
a
place
of
the
sort
and
wanted
to
sell
out
that
was
what
made
me
think
of
you
must
start
or
early
yes
said
ginger
doubtfully
of
course
there
the
catch
you
what
catch
the
capital
you
got
to
have
that
this
fellow
would
sell
out
under
five
thousand
i
lend
you
five
thousand
no
said
ginger
sally
looked
at
him
with
exasperation
ginger
i
like
to
slap
you
she
said
it
was
maddening
this
intrusion
of
sentiment
into
business
affairs
why
simply
because
he
was
a
man
and
she
was
a
woman
should
she
be
restrained
from
investing
money
in
a
sound
commercial
undertaking
if
columbus
had
taken
up
this
stand
towards
queen
isabella
america
would
never
have
been
discovered
i
ca
take
five
thousand
dollars
off
you
said
ginger
firmly
who
talking
of
taking
it
off
me
as
you
call
it
stormed
sally
ca
you
forget
your
burglarious
career
for
a
second
this
is
the
same
thing
as
going
about
stealing
defenceless
girls
photographs
this
is
business
i
think
you
would
make
an
enormous
success
of
a
and
you
admit
you
good
so
why
make
frivolous
objections
why
should
i
put
money
into
a
good
thing
do
you
want
me
to
get
rich
or
what
is
it
ginger
was
becoming
confused
argument
had
never
been
his
strong
point
but
it
such
a
lot
of
to
you
perhaps
not
to
me
i
a
plutocrat
five
thousand
dollars
what
five
thousand
dollars
i
feed
it
to
the
ginger
pondered
woodenly
for
a
while
his
was
a
literal
mind
and
he
knew
nothing
of
sally
finances
beyond
the
fact
that
when
he
had
first
met
her
she
had
come
into
a
legacy
of
some
kind
moreover
he
had
been
hugely
impressed
by
fillmore
magnificence
it
seemed
plain
enough
that
the
nicholases
were
a
wealthy
family
i
do
like
it
you
know
he
said
you
do
have
to
like
it
said
sally
you
just
do
a
consoling
thought
flashed
upon
ginger
you
have
to
let
me
pay
you
let
you
my
lad
you
have
to
pay
me
interest
what
do
you
think
this
is
a
round
game
it
a
cold
business
topping
said
ginger
relieved
how
about
per
do
be
silly
said
sally
quickly
i
want
no
that
all
rot
protested
ginger
i
mean
to
say
three
i
do
he
went
on
making
a
concession
mind
saying
if
you
insist
i
make
it
five
not
well
ten
then
five
suppose
said
ginger
insinuatingly
i
said
seven
i
never
saw
anyone
like
you
for
haggling
said
sally
with
disapproval
listen
six
and
that
my
last
six
ginger
did
sums
in
his
head
but
that
would
only
work
out
at
three
hundred
dollars
a
year
it
what
do
you
know
about
it
as
if
i
had
been
handling
this
sort
of
deal
in
my
life
six
do
you
agree
i
suppose
then
that
settled
is
this
man
you
talk
about
in
new
york
no
he
down
on
long
island
at
a
place
on
the
south
i
mean
can
you
get
him
on
the
and
clinch
the
thing
oh
yes
i
know
his
address
and
i
suppose
his
number
in
the
then
go
off
at
once
and
settle
with
him
before
somebody
else
snaps
him
up
do
waste
a
ginger
paused
at
the
door
i
say
you
absolutely
sure
about
this
of
i
mean
to
say
get
on
said
sally
the
window
of
sally
looked
out
on
to
a
street
which
while
not
one
of
the
city
important
arteries
was
capable
nevertheless
of
affording
a
certain
amount
of
entertainment
to
the
observer
and
after
ginger
had
left
she
carried
the
morning
paper
to
the
and
proceeded
to
divide
her
attention
between
a
third
reading
of
the
and
a
lazy
survey
of
the
outer
world
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
the
outer
world
was
looking
its
best
she
had
not
been
at
her
post
for
many
minutes
when
a
stopped
at
the
and
she
was
surprised
and
interested
to
see
her
brother
fillmore
heave
himself
out
of
the
interior
he
paid
the
driver
and
the
cab
moved
off
leaving
him
on
the
sidewalk
casting
a
large
shadow
in
the
sunshine
sally
was
on
the
point
of
calling
to
him
when
his
behaviour
became
so
odd
that
astonishment
checked
her
from
where
she
sat
fillmore
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
man
practising
the
steps
of
a
new
dance
and
sheer
curiosity
as
to
what
he
would
do
next
kept
sally
watching
in
silence
first
he
moved
in
a
resolute
sort
of
way
towards
the
front
door
then
suddenly
stopping
scuttled
back
this
movement
he
repeated
twice
after
which
he
stood
in
deep
thought
before
making
another
dash
for
the
door
which
like
the
others
came
to
an
abrupt
end
as
though
he
had
run
into
some
invisible
obstacle
and
finally
wheeling
sharply
he
bustled
off
down
the
street
and
was
lost
to
view
sally
could
make
nothing
of
it
if
fillmore
had
taken
the
trouble
to
come
in
a
obviously
to
call
upon
her
why
had
he
abandoned
the
idea
at
her
very
threshold
she
was
still
speculating
on
this
mystery
when
the
rang
and
her
brother
voice
spoke
huskily
in
her
ear
sally
hullo
fill
what
are
you
going
to
call
it
what
am
i
call
what
the
dance
you
were
doing
outside
here
just
now
it
your
own
invention
is
it
did
you
see
me
said
fillmore
upset
of
course
i
saw
you
i
was
i
er
i
was
coming
to
have
a
talk
with
you
sally
fillmore
voice
trailed
off
well
why
did
you
there
was
a
pause
on
fillmore
part
if
the
timbre
of
at
his
voice
correctly
indicated
his
feelings
a
pause
of
discomfort
something
was
plainly
vexing
fillmore
great
mind
sally
he
said
at
last
and
coughed
hollowly
into
the
receiver
i
that
is
to
say
i
have
asked
gladys
gladys
will
be
coming
to
see
you
very
shortly
will
you
be
in
i
stay
in
how
is
gladys
i
longing
to
see
her
she
is
very
well
a
trifle
a
little
upset
what
about
she
will
tell
you
when
she
arrives
i
have
just
been
to
her
she
is
coming
at
there
was
another
pause
i
afraid
she
has
bad
what
news
there
was
silence
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
what
news
repeated
sally
a
little
sharply
she
hated
mysteries
but
fillmore
had
rung
off
sally
hung
up
the
receiver
thoughtfully
she
was
puzzled
and
anxious
however
there
being
nothing
to
be
gained
by
worrying
she
carried
the
breakfast
things
into
the
kitchen
and
tried
to
divert
herself
by
washing
up
presently
a
ring
at
the
brought
her
out
to
find
her
marriage
even
though
it
had
brought
with
it
the
lofty
position
of
partnership
with
the
hope
of
the
american
stage
had
effected
no
noticeable
alteration
in
the
former
miss
winch
as
fillmore
she
was
the
same
square
friendly
creature
she
hugged
sally
in
a
muscular
manner
and
went
on
in
the
well
it
great
seeing
you
again
she
said
i
began
to
think
you
were
never
coming
back
what
was
the
big
idea
springing
over
to
england
like
that
sally
had
been
expecting
the
question
and
answered
it
with
composure
i
wanted
to
help
who
faucitt
has
fillmore
ever
mentioned
him
he
was
a
dear
old
man
at
the
and
his
brother
died
and
left
him
a
dressmaking
establishment
in
london
he
screamed
to
me
to
come
and
tell
him
what
to
do
about
it
he
has
sold
it
now
and
is
quite
happy
in
the
well
the
trip
done
you
good
said
fillmore
you
prettier
than
there
was
a
pause
already
in
these
trivial
opening
exchanges
sally
had
sensed
a
suggestion
of
unwonted
gravity
in
her
companion
she
missed
that
careless
whimsicality
which
had
been
the
chief
characteristic
of
miss
gladys
winch
and
seemed
to
have
been
cast
off
by
fillmore
nicholas
at
their
meeting
before
she
had
spoken
sally
had
not
noticed
this
but
now
it
was
apparent
that
something
was
weighing
on
her
companion
fillmore
honest
eyes
were
troubled
what
the
bad
news
asked
sally
abruptly
she
wanted
to
end
the
suspense
fillmore
was
telling
me
over
the
that
you
had
some
bad
news
for
fillmore
scratched
at
the
carpet
for
a
moment
with
the
end
of
her
parasol
without
replying
when
she
spoke
it
was
not
in
answer
to
the
question
sally
who
this
man
carmyle
over
in
england
oh
did
fillmore
tell
you
about
him
he
told
me
there
was
a
rich
fellow
over
in
england
who
was
crazy
about
you
and
had
asked
you
to
marry
him
and
that
you
had
turned
him
sally
momentary
annoyance
faded
she
could
hardly
she
felt
have
expected
fillmore
to
refrain
from
mentioning
the
matter
to
his
wife
yes
she
said
that
you
could
write
and
say
you
changed
your
mind
sally
annoyance
returned
all
her
life
she
had
been
intensely
independent
resentful
of
interference
with
her
private
concerns
i
suppose
i
could
if
i
had
but
i
have
did
fillmore
tell
you
to
try
to
talk
me
round
oh
i
not
trying
to
talk
you
round
said
fillmore
quickly
goodness
knows
i
the
last
person
to
try
and
jolly
anyone
into
marrying
anybody
if
they
did
feel
like
it
i
seen
too
many
marriages
go
wrong
to
do
that
look
at
elsa
sally
heart
jumped
as
if
an
exposed
nerve
had
been
touched
elsa
she
stammered
and
hated
herself
because
her
voice
shook
has
has
her
marriage
gone
wrong
gone
all
to
bits
said
fillmore
shortly
you
remember
she
married
gerald
foster
the
man
who
wrote
primrose
way
sally
with
an
effort
repressed
an
hysterical
laugh
yes
i
remember
she
said
well
it
all
gone
i
tell
you
about
that
in
a
minute
coming
back
to
this
man
in
england
if
you
in
any
doubt
about
it
i
mean
you
ca
always
tell
right
away
whether
you
fond
of
a
man
or
not
when
first
i
met
fillmore
i
could
see
him
with
a
and
now
he
just
the
whole
but
that
not
what
i
wanted
to
talk
about
i
was
saying
one
does
always
know
own
mind
at
first
and
if
this
fellow
really
is
a
good
fellow
and
fillmore
tells
me
he
got
all
the
money
in
the
world
sally
stopped
her
no
it
no
good
i
do
want
to
marry
that
that
then
said
fillmore
it
a
pity
why
are
you
taking
it
so
much
to
heart
said
sally
with
a
nervous
laugh
well
fillmore
paused
sally
anxiety
was
growing
it
must
she
realized
be
something
very
serious
indeed
that
had
happened
if
it
had
the
power
to
make
her
forthright
disjointed
in
her
talk
you
see
went
on
fillmore
and
stopped
again
gee
hating
this
she
murmured
what
is
it
i
do
you
find
it
all
too
darned
clear
by
the
time
i
through
said
fillmore
mournfully
if
i
going
to
explain
this
thing
i
guess
i
best
start
at
the
beginning
you
remember
that
revue
of
fillmore
the
one
we
both
begged
him
not
to
put
on
it
flopped
oh
yes
it
flopped
on
the
road
and
died
there
never
got
to
new
york
at
all
ike
schumann
would
let
fillmore
have
a
theatre
the
book
wanted
fixing
and
the
numbers
wanted
fixing
and
the
scenery
was
right
and
while
they
were
tinkering
with
all
that
there
was
trouble
about
the
cast
and
the
actors
equity
closed
the
show
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
really
and
i
was
glad
at
the
time
because
going
on
with
it
would
only
have
meant
wasting
more
money
and
it
had
cost
a
fortune
already
after
that
fillmore
put
on
a
play
of
gerald
foster
and
that
was
a
frost
too
it
ran
a
week
at
the
booth
i
hear
the
new
piece
got
in
rehearsal
now
is
no
good
either
it
called
wild
rose
or
something
but
fillmore
got
nothing
to
do
with
but
sally
tried
to
speak
but
fillmore
went
on
do
talk
just
yet
or
i
shall
never
get
this
thing
straight
well
you
know
fillmore
poor
darling
anyone
else
would
have
pulled
in
his
horns
and
gone
slow
for
a
spell
but
he
one
of
those
fellows
whose
horse
is
always
going
to
win
the
next
race
the
big
killing
is
always
just
round
the
corner
with
him
funny
how
you
can
see
what
a
chump
a
man
is
and
yet
love
him
to
death
i
remember
saying
something
like
that
to
you
before
he
thought
he
could
get
it
all
back
by
staging
this
fight
of
his
that
came
off
in
jersey
city
last
night
and
if
everything
had
gone
right
he
might
have
got
afloat
again
but
it
seems
as
if
he
touch
anything
without
it
turning
to
mud
on
the
very
day
before
the
fight
was
to
come
off
the
poor
mutt
who
was
going
against
the
champion
goes
and
lets
a
of
his
own
knock
him
down
and
fool
around
with
him
with
all
the
newspaper
men
there
too
you
probably
saw
about
it
in
the
papers
it
made
a
great
story
for
them
well
that
killed
the
whole
thing
the
public
had
never
been
any
too
sure
that
this
fellow
bugs
butler
had
a
chance
of
putting
up
a
scrap
with
the
champion
that
would
be
worth
paying
to
see
and
when
they
read
that
he
even
stop
his
slamming
him
all
around
the
place
they
simply
decided
to
stay
away
poor
old
fill
it
was
a
finisher
for
him
the
house
was
a
quarter
full
and
after
he
paid
these
two
pluguglies
their
guarantees
which
they
insisted
on
having
before
so
much
as
go
into
the
ring
he
was
just
about
cleaned
out
so
there
you
are
sally
had
listened
with
dismay
to
this
catalogue
of
misfortunes
oh
poor
fill
she
cried
how
dreadful
pretty
but
primrose
way
is
a
big
success
is
it
said
sally
anxious
to
discover
something
of
brightness
in
the
situation
it
fillmore
flushed
again
this
is
the
part
i
hate
having
to
tell
it
was
do
you
mean
it
is
still
i
thought
elsa
had
made
such
a
tremendous
hit
i
read
about
it
when
i
was
over
in
london
it
was
even
in
one
of
the
english
yes
she
made
a
hit
all
right
said
fillmore
drily
she
made
such
a
hit
that
all
the
other
managements
in
new
york
were
after
her
right
away
and
fillmore
had
hardly
sailed
when
she
handed
in
her
notice
and
signed
up
with
goble
and
cohn
for
a
new
piece
they
are
starring
her
ah
she
could
cried
sally
my
dear
she
did
she
out
on
the
road
with
it
now
i
had
to
break
the
news
to
poor
old
fillmore
at
the
dock
when
he
landed
it
was
rather
a
blow
i
must
say
it
was
what
i
would
call
playing
the
game
i
know
there
is
supposed
to
be
any
sentiment
in
business
but
after
all
we
had
given
elsa
her
big
chance
but
fillmore
would
put
her
name
up
over
the
theatre
in
electrics
and
goble
and
cohn
made
it
a
clause
in
her
contract
that
they
would
so
nothing
else
mattered
people
are
like
but
elsa
she
used
not
to
be
like
they
all
get
that
way
they
must
grab
success
if
it
to
be
grabbed
i
suppose
you
ca
blame
them
you
might
just
as
well
expect
a
cat
to
keep
off
catnip
still
she
might
have
waited
to
the
end
of
the
new
york
fillmore
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
sally
well
got
it
out
now
she
said
and
believe
me
it
was
one
rotten
job
you
do
know
how
sorry
i
am
sally
i
would
have
had
it
happen
for
a
million
dollars
nor
would
fillmore
i
not
sure
that
i
blame
him
for
getting
cold
feet
and
backing
out
of
telling
you
himself
he
just
the
nerve
to
come
and
confess
that
he
had
fooled
away
your
money
he
was
hoping
all
along
that
this
fight
would
pan
out
big
and
that
he
be
able
to
pay
you
back
what
you
had
loaned
him
but
things
did
happen
sally
was
silent
she
was
thinking
how
strange
it
was
that
this
room
in
which
she
had
hoped
to
be
so
happy
had
been
from
the
first
moment
of
her
occupancy
a
storm
centre
of
bad
news
and
miserable
disillusionment
in
this
first
shock
of
the
tidings
it
was
the
disillusionment
that
hurt
most
she
had
always
been
so
fond
of
elsa
and
elsa
had
always
seemed
so
fond
of
her
she
remembered
that
letter
of
elsa
with
all
its
protestations
of
gratitude
it
was
straight
it
was
horrible
callous
selfish
altogether
horrible
it
she
choked
as
a
rush
of
indignation
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
it
beastly
i
i
not
thinking
about
my
money
just
bad
luck
but
elsa
fillmore
shrugged
her
square
shoulders
well
it
happening
all
the
time
in
the
show
business
she
said
and
in
every
other
business
too
i
guess
if
one
only
knew
enough
about
them
to
be
able
to
say
of
course
it
hits
you
hard
because
elsa
was
a
pal
of
yours
and
you
thinking
she
might
have
considered
you
after
all
you
done
for
her
i
ca
say
i
much
surprised
fillmore
was
talking
rapidly
and
dimly
sally
understood
that
she
was
talking
so
that
talk
would
carry
her
over
this
bad
moment
silence
now
would
have
been
unendurable
i
was
in
the
company
with
her
and
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
as
if
you
ca
get
to
know
a
person
right
through
till
you
been
in
the
same
company
with
them
elsa
all
right
but
she
two
people
really
like
these
dual
identity
cases
you
read
about
she
awfully
fond
of
you
i
know
she
is
she
was
always
saying
so
and
it
was
quite
genuine
if
it
did
interfere
with
business
nothing
she
would
do
for
you
but
when
it
a
case
of
her
career
you
do
count
nobody
counts
not
even
her
husband
now
that
funny
if
you
think
that
sort
of
thing
funny
personally
it
gives
me
the
what
funny
asked
sally
dully
well
you
were
there
so
you
did
see
it
but
i
was
on
the
spot
all
the
time
and
i
know
as
well
as
i
know
anything
that
he
simply
married
her
because
he
thought
she
could
get
him
on
in
the
game
he
hardly
paid
any
attention
to
her
at
all
till
she
was
such
a
riot
in
chicago
and
then
he
was
all
over
her
and
now
he
got
stung
she
throws
down
his
show
and
goes
off
to
another
fellow
it
like
marrying
for
money
and
finding
the
girl
has
any
and
she
got
stung
too
in
a
way
because
i
pretty
sure
she
married
him
mostly
because
she
thought
he
was
going
to
be
the
next
big
man
in
the
business
and
could
boost
her
up
the
ladder
and
now
it
does
look
as
though
he
had
another
success
in
him
the
result
is
they
at
outs
i
hear
he
drinking
somebody
who
seen
him
told
me
he
had
gone
all
to
pieces
you
have
seen
him
i
suppose
i
thought
maybe
you
might
have
run
into
him
he
lives
right
sally
clutched
at
the
arm
of
her
chair
lives
right
opposite
gerald
foster
what
do
you
mean
across
the
passage
there
said
fillmore
jerking
her
thumb
at
the
door
did
you
know
that
right
i
suppose
you
did
they
moved
in
after
you
had
beaten
it
for
england
elsa
wanted
to
be
near
you
and
she
was
tickled
to
death
when
she
found
there
was
an
apartment
to
be
had
right
across
from
you
now
that
just
proves
what
i
was
saying
a
while
ago
about
elsa
if
she
was
fond
of
you
would
she
go
out
of
her
way
to
camp
next
door
and
yet
though
she
so
fond
of
you
she
hesitate
about
wrecking
your
property
by
quitting
the
show
when
she
sees
a
chance
of
doing
herself
a
bit
of
good
it
funny
is
it
the
tinkling
sharply
rescued
sally
from
the
necessity
of
a
reply
she
forced
herself
across
the
room
to
answer
it
hullo
ginger
voice
spoke
jubilantly
hullo
are
you
there
i
say
it
all
right
about
that
binge
you
oh
yes
that
dog
fellow
you
know
said
ginger
with
a
slight
diminution
of
exuberance
his
sensitive
ear
had
seemed
to
detect
a
lack
of
animation
in
her
voice
i
just
been
talking
to
him
over
the
and
all
settled
if
he
added
with
a
touch
of
doubt
you
still
feel
like
going
into
it
i
there
was
an
instant
in
which
sally
hesitated
but
it
was
only
an
instant
why
of
course
she
said
steadily
why
should
you
think
i
had
changed
my
mind
well
i
thought
that
is
to
say
you
seemed
oh
i
do
you
imagine
things
i
was
a
little
worried
about
something
when
you
called
me
up
and
my
mind
was
working
properly
of
course
go
ahead
with
it
ginger
i
i
say
i
awfully
sorry
you
oh
it
all
something
bad
nothing
that
kill
me
i
young
and
ginger
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
say
i
do
want
to
butt
in
but
can
i
do
anything
no
really
ginger
i
know
you
would
do
anything
you
could
but
this
is
just
something
i
must
worry
through
by
myself
when
do
you
go
down
to
this
place
i
was
thinking
of
popping
down
this
afternoon
just
to
take
a
look
let
me
know
what
train
you
making
and
i
come
and
see
you
that
ripping
of
you
right
ho
well
so
so
long
said
sally
fillmore
who
had
been
sitting
in
that
state
of
suspended
animation
which
comes
upon
people
who
are
present
at
a
telephone
conversation
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
themselves
came
to
life
as
sally
replaced
the
receiver
sally
she
said
i
think
we
ought
to
have
a
talk
now
about
what
you
going
to
sally
was
not
feeling
equal
to
any
discussion
of
the
future
all
she
asked
of
the
world
at
the
moment
was
to
be
left
alone
oh
that
all
right
i
shall
manage
you
ought
to
be
worrying
about
fillmore
got
me
to
look
after
him
said
gladys
with
quiet
determination
you
the
one
that
on
my
mind
i
lay
awake
all
last
night
thinking
about
you
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
from
fillmore
still
a
few
thousand
dollars
left
well
as
it
happens
i
can
put
you
on
to
a
really
good
thing
i
know
a
girl

afraid
interrupted
sally
all
the
rest
of
my
money
what
there
is
of
it
is
tied
you
ca
get
hold
of
it
but
listen
said
fillmore
urgently
this
is
a
really
good
thing
this
girl
i
know
started
an
interior
decorating
business
some
time
ago
and
is
pulling
in
the
money
in
handfuls
but
she
wants
more
capital
and
she
willing
to
let
go
of
a
third
of
the
business
to
anyone
who
put
in
a
few
thousand
she
wo
have
any
difficulty
getting
it
but
i
her
this
morning
to
hold
off
till
i
heard
from
you
honestly
sally
it
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
it
would
put
you
right
on
easy
street
is
there
really
any
way
you
could
get
your
money
out
of
this
other
thing
and
take
on
this
deal
there
really
is
i
awfully
obliged
to
you
gladys
dear
but
well
said
fillmore
prodding
the
carpet
energetically
with
her
parasol
i
do
know
what
you
gone
into
but
unless
they
given
you
a
share
in
the
mint
or
something
you
be
losing
by
not
making
the
switch
you
sure
you
ca
do
it
i
really
fillmore
rose
plainly
disappointed
well
you
know
best
of
course
gosh
what
a
muddle
everything
is
sally
she
said
suddenly
stopping
at
the
door
you
not
going
to
hate
poor
old
fillmore
over
this
are
you
why
of
course
not
the
whole
thing
was
just
bad
he
worried
stiff
about
well
give
him
my
love
and
tell
him
not
to
be
so
fillmore
crossed
the
room
and
kissed
sally
impulsively
you
an
angel
she
said
i
wish
there
were
more
like
you
but
i
guess
they
lost
the
pattern
well
i
go
back
and
tell
fillmore
that
it
relieve
the
door
closed
and
sally
sat
down
with
her
chin
in
her
hands
to
think
isadore
abrahams
the
founder
and
proprietor
of
that
deservedly
popular
dancing
resort
poetically
named
the
flower
garden
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
contented
sigh
and
laid
down
the
knife
and
fork
with
which
he
had
been
assailing
a
plateful
of
succulent
goulash
he
was
dining
as
was
his
admirable
custom
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
at
his
residence
at
far
rockaway
across
the
table
his
wife
rebecca
beamed
at
him
over
her
comfortable
plinth
of
chins
and
round
the
table
his
children
david
jacob
morris
and
saide
would
have
beamed
at
him
if
they
had
not
been
too
busy
at
the
moment
ingurgitating
goulash
a
genial
honest
domestic
man
was
abrahams
a
credit
to
the
community
mother
he
said
pa
said
abrahams
knew
there
was
something
i
meant
to
tell
you
said
abrahams
absently
chasing
a
piece
of
bread
round
his
plate
with
a
stout
finger
you
remember
that
girl
i
told
you
about
some
time
back
girl
working
at
the
garden
girl
called
nicholas
who
came
into
a
bit
of
money
and
threw
up
her
job
i
remember
you
liked
her
jakie
dear
do
ai
gobbling
said
master
abrahams
everybody
liked
her
said
abrahams
the
nicest
girl
i
ever
hired
and
i
do
hire
none
but
nice
girls
because
the
garden
a
nice
place
and
i
like
to
run
it
nice
i
would
give
you
a
nickel
for
any
of
your
tough
joints
where
you
get
nothing
but
and
scare
away
all
the
real
folks
everybody
liked
sally
nicholas
always
pleasant
and
always
smiling
and
never
anything
but
the
lady
it
was
a
treat
to
have
her
around
well
what
do
you
think
dead
inquired
abrahams
apprehensively
the
story
had
sounded
to
her
as
though
it
were
heading
that
way
wipe
your
mouth
jakie
no
not
dead
said
abrahams
conscious
for
the
first
time
that
the
remainder
of
his
narrative
might
be
considered
by
a
critic
something
of
an
and
lacking
in
drama
but
she
was
in
to
see
me
this
afternoon
and
wants
her
job
ah
said
abrahams
rather
tonelessly
an
ardent
supporter
of
the
local
palace
she
had
hoped
for
a
slightly
more
gingery
denouement
something
with
a
bit
more
punch
yes
but
do
it
show
you
continued
abrahams
gallantly
trying
to
work
up
the
interest
there
this
girl
goes
out
of
my
place
not
a
year
ago
with
a
good
in
her
pocket
and
here
she
is
back
again
all
of
it
spent
do
it
show
you
what
a
tragedy
life
is
if
you
see
what
i
mean
and
how
careful
one
ought
to
be
about
money
it
what
i
call
a
human
document
goodness
knows
how
she
been
and
gone
and
spent
it
all
i
never
have
thought
she
was
the
sort
of
girl
to
go
gadding
around
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
kind
of
what
gadding
pop
asked
master
jakie
the
goulash
having
ceased
to
chain
his
interest
well
she
wanted
her
job
back
and
i
gave
it
to
her
and
glad
to
get
her
back
again
there
class
to
that
girl
she
the
sort
of
girl
i
want
in
the
place
do
seem
quite
to
have
so
much
in
her
as
she
used
to
seems
kind
of
quieted
down
but
she
got
class
and
i
glad
she
back
i
hope
she
stay
but
do
it
show
you
ah
said
abrahams
with
more
enthusiasm
than
before
it
had
not
worked
out
such
a
bad
story
after
all
in
its
essentials
it
was
not
unlike
the
film
she
had
seen
the
previous
evening
gloria
gooch
in
a
girl
against
the
pop
said
master
abrahams
yes
jakie
when

chapter
xv
uncle
donald
speaks
his
mind
there
is
in
certain
men
and
bruce
carmyle
was
one
of
them
a
quality
of
resilience
a
sturdy
refusal
to
acknowledge
defeat
which
aids
them
as
effectively
in
affairs
of
the
heart
as
in
encounters
of
a
sterner
and
more
practical
kind
as
a
wooer
bruce
carmyle
resembled
that
durable
type
of
pugilist
who
can
only
give
of
his
best
after
he
has
received
at
least
one
substantial
wallop
on
some
tender
spot
although
sally
had
refused
his
offer
of
marriage
quite
definitely
at
monk
crofton
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
consider
the
episode
closed
all
his
life
he
had
been
accustomed
to
getting
what
he
wanted
and
he
meant
to
get
it
now
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
wanted
sally
there
had
been
moments
when
he
had
been
conscious
of
certain
doubts
but
in
the
smart
of
temporary
defeat
these
had
vanished
that
streak
of
bohemianism
in
her
which
from
time
to
time
since
their
first
meeting
had
jarred
upon
his
orderly
mind
was
forgotten
and
all
that
carmyle
could
remember
was
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
the
jaunty
lift
of
her
chin
and
the
gallant
trimness
of
her
her
gay
prettiness
seemed
to
flick
at
him
like
a
whip
in
the
darkness
of
wakeful
nights
lashing
him
to
pursuit
and
quietly
and
methodically
like
a
respectable
wolf
settling
on
the
trail
of
a
red
riding
hood
he
prepared
to
pursue
delicacy
and
imagination
might
have
kept
him
back
but
in
these
qualities
he
had
never
been
strong
one
can
not
have
everything
his
preparations
for
departure
though
he
did
his
best
to
make
them
swiftly
and
secretly
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
family
in
many
english
families
there
seems
to
exist
a
system
of
and
like
that
of
those
savage
tribes
in
africa
who
pass
the
latest
item
of
news
and
interest
from
point
to
point
over
miles
of
intervening
jungle
by
some
telepathic
method
never
properly
explained
on
his
last
night
in
london
there
entered
to
bruce
carmyle
at
his
apartment
in
south
audley
street
the
family
chosen
representative
the
man
to
whom
the
family
pointed
with
pride
uncle
donald
in
the
flesh
there
were
two
hundred
and
forty
pounds
of
the
flesh
uncle
donald
was
in
and
the
chair
in
which
he
deposited
it
creaked
beneath
its
burden
once
at
monk
crofton
sally
had
spoiled
a
whole
morning
for
her
brother
fillmore
by
indicating
uncle
donald
as
the
exact
image
of
what
he
would
be
when
he
grew
up
a
superstition
cherished
from
early
schooldays
that
he
had
a
weak
heart
had
caused
the
family
managing
director
to
abstain
from
every
form
of
exercise
for
nearly
fifty
years
and
as
he
combined
with
a
distaste
for
exercise
one
of
the
three
heartiest
appetites
in
the
postal
division
of
london
uncle
donald
at
was
not
a
man
one
would
willingly
have
lounging
in
one
armchairs
bruce
carmyle
customary
respectfulness
was
tinged
with
something
approaching
dislike
as
he
looked
at
him
uncle
donald
walrus
moustache
heaved
gently
upon
his
laboured
breath
like
seaweed
on
a
there
had
been
stairs
to
climb
what
this
what
this
he
contrived
to
ejaculate
at
last
you
packing
yes
said
carmyle
shortly
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
conscious
of
that
sensation
of
furtive
guilt
which
was
habitual
with
his
cousin
ginger
when
in
the
presence
of
this
large
man
you
going
away
where
you
going
when
you
going
why
you
going
this
dialogue
has
been
set
down
as
though
it
had
been
as
brisk
and
snappy
as
any
between
vaudeville
comedians
but
in
reality
uncle
donald
peculiar
methods
of
conversation
had
stretched
it
over
a
period
of
nearly
three
minutes
for
after
each
reply
and
before
each
question
he
had
puffed
and
sighed
and
inhaled
his
moustache
with
such
painful
deliberation
that
his
companion
nerves
were
finding
it
difficult
to
bear
up
under
the
strain
you
going
after
that
girl
said
uncle
donald
accusingly
bruce
carmyle
flushed
darkly
and
it
is
interesting
to
record
that
at
this
moment
there
flitted
through
his
mind
the
thought
that
behaviour
at
bleke
coffee
house
on
a
certain
notable
occasion
had
not
been
so
utterly
inexcusable
as
he
had
supposed
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
family
chosen
one
could
be
trying
will
you
have
a
whisky
and
soda
uncle
donald
he
said
by
way
of
changing
the
conversation
yes
said
his
relative
in
pursuance
of
a
vow
he
had
made
in
the
early
eighties
never
to
refuse
an
offer
of
this
kind
gim
me
you
would
have
thought
that
that
would
have
put
matters
on
a
pleasanter
footing
but
no
having
lapped
up
the
restorative
uncle
donald
returned
to
the
attack
quite
never
thought
you
were
a
fool
before
he
said
severely
bruce
carmyle
proud
spirit
chafed
this
sort
of
interview
which
had
become
a
commonplace
with
his
cousin
ginger
was
new
to
him
hitherto
his
actions
had
received
neither
criticism
nor
been
subjected
to
it
i
not
a
you
are
a
fool
a
damn
fool
continued
uncle
donald
specifying
more
exactly
do
like
the
girl
never
did
not
a
nice
girl
did
like
her
right
from
the
need
we
discuss
this
said
bruce
carmyle
dropping
as
he
was
apt
to
do
into
the
grand
manner
the
head
of
the
family
drank
in
a
layer
of
moustache
and
blew
it
out
again
need
we
discuss
it
he
said
with
asperity
we
going
to
discuss
it
whatch

i
climbed
all
these
blasted
stairs
for
with
my
weak
heart

anyone

pardon
me
uncle
donald
said
carmyle
stiffly
but
that
is
surely
rather
absurd
if
that
were
the
case
why
should
she
have
refused
me
at
monk
crofton
drawing
you
on
said
uncle
donald
promptly
luring
you
on
trick
girl
in
when
i
was
at
oxford
tried
to
lure
me
on
if
i
had
had
some
sense
and
a
weak
heart
whatch

of
this
girl
whatch

i
met

at
roville
in
travelling
with
her
family
travelling
alone
said
bruce
carmyle
reluctantly
not
even
with
that
brother
of
hers
bad
said
uncle
donald
bad
bad
american
girls
are
accustomed
to
more
independence
than
english
that
young
man
said
uncle
donald
pursuing
a
train
of
thought
is
going
to
be
fat
one
of
these
days
if
he
does
look
out
travelling
alone
was
she
what
did
you
do
catch
her
eye
on
the
pier
really
uncle
donald
well
must
have
got
to
know
her
i
was
introduced
to
her
by
lancelot
she
was
a
friend
of
lancelot
exploded
uncle
donald
quivering
all
over
like
a
smitten
jelly
at
the
loathed
name
well
that
shows
you
what
sort
of
a
girl
she
is
any
girl
that
would
be
a
friend
of
unpack
i
beg
your
pardon
unpack
must
go
on
with
this
foolery
out
of
the
question
find
some
girl
make
you
a
good
wife
your
aunt
mary
been
meeting
some
people
name
of
related
kent
eldest
daughter
charming
girl
just
do
for
outside
the
pages
of
the
more
type
of
fiction
nobody
ever
really
ground
his
teeth
but
bruce
carmyle
came
nearer
to
it
at
that
moment
than
anyone
had
ever
come
before
he
scowled
blackly
and
the
last
trace
of
suavity
left
him
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
he
said
briefly
i
sail
uncle
donald
had
had
a
previous
experience
of
being
defied
by
a
nephew
but
it
had
not
accustomed
him
to
the
sensation
he
was
aware
of
an
unpleasant
feeling
of
impotence
nothing
is
harder
than
to
know
what
to
do
next
when
defied
eh
he
said
carmyle
having
started
to
defy
evidently
decided
to
make
a
good
job
of
it
i
am
over
said
he
i
am
financially
independent
i
shall
do
as
i
but
consider
pleaded
uncle
donald
painfully
conscious
of
the
weakness
of
his
words
reflect
i
have
your
position
in
the
county
i
thought
of
you
could
marry
anyone
you
i
going
you
are
determined
to
go
running
off
to
after
this
miss
have
you
considered
said
uncle
donald
portentously
that
you
owe
a
duty
to
the
bruce
carmyle
patience
snapped
and
he
sank
like
a
stone
to
absolutely
gingerian
depths
of
oh
damn
the
family
he
cried
there
was
a
painful
silence
broken
only
by
the
relieved
sigh
of
the
armchair
as
uncle
donald
heaved
himself
out
of
it
after
that
said
uncle
donald
i
have
nothing
more
to
good
said
carmyle
rudely
lost
to
all
shame
this
if
you
come
back
married
to
that
girl
i
cut
you
in
piccadilly
by
george
i
will
he
moved
to
the
door
bruce
carmyle
looked
down
his
nose
without
speaking
a
tense
moment
what
asked
uncle
donald
his
fingers
on
the
handle
did
you
say
it
was
called
what
was
what
called
that
and
wherj
get
it
bilby
in
oxford
i
make
a
note
of
it
said
uncle
donald
chapter
xvi
at
the
flower
garden
and
after
all
i
done
for
her
said
reginald
cracknell
his
voice
tremulous
with
and
his
eyes
moist
with
the
combined
effects
of
anguish
and
in
his
celebrated
private
stock
after
all
i
done
for
her
she
throws
me
sally
did
not
reply
the
orchestra
of
the
flower
garden
was
of
a
calibre
that
discouraged
vocal
competition
and
she
was
having
moreover
too
much
difficulty
in
adjusting
her
feet
to
cracknell
erratic
to
employ
her
attention
elsewhere
they
manoeuvred
jerkily
past
the
table
where
miss
mabel
hobson
the
flower
garden
newest
hostess
sat
watching
the
revels
with
a
distant
hauteur
miss
hobson
was
looking
her
most
regal
in
old
gold
and
black
and
a
sorrowful
gulp
escaped
the
stricken
cracknell
as
he
shambled
beneath
her
eye
if
i
told
you
he
moaned
in
sally
ear
what
was
that
your
ankle
sorry
do
know
what
i
doing
if
i
told
you
what
i
had
spent
on
that
woman
you
would
believe
it
and
then
she
throws
me
down
and
all
because
i
said
i
did
like
her
in
that
hat
she
spoken
to
me
for
a
week
and
wo
answer
when
i
call
up
on
the
and
i
was
right
too
it
was
a
rotten
hat
did
suit
her
a
bit
but
that
said
cracknell
morosely
is
a
woman
all
over
sally
uttered
a
stifled
exclamation
as
his
wandering
foot
descended
on
hers
before
she
could
get
it
out
of
the
way
cracknell
interpreted
the
ejaculation
as
a
protest
against
the
sweeping
harshness
of
his
last
remark
and
gallantly
tried
to
make
amends
i
do
mean
you
like
that
he
said
you
different
i
could
see
that
directly
i
saw
you
you
have
a
sympathetic
nature
that
why
telling
you
all
this
you
a
sensible
and
girl
and
can
understand
i
done
everything
for
that
woman
i
got
her
this
job
as
hostess
here
you
would
believe
what
they
pay
her
i
starred
her
in
a
show
once
did
you
see
those
pearls
she
was
wearing
i
gave
her
those
and
she
wo
speak
to
me
just
because
i
did
like
her
hat
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
that
hat
you
would
agree
with
me
i
know
because
you
a
sensible
girl
and
understand
hats
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
come
here
every
sally
was
aware
of
this
she
had
seen
him
often
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
lee
schoenstein
the
gentlemanly
master
of
ceremonies
had
inflicted
him
on
her
i
come
here
every
night
and
dance
past
her
table
but
she
wo
look
at
me
what
asked
cracknell
tears
welling
in
his
pale
eyes
would
you
do
about
it
i
do
know
said
sally
frankly
nor
do
i
thought
you
would
because
you
a
sensible
i
mean
nor
do
i
having
one
last
try
if
you
can
keep
a
secret
you
wo
tell
anyone
will
you
pleaded
cracknell
urgently
but
i
know
you
wo
because
you
a
sensible
i
giving
her
a
little
present
having
it
brought
here
little
present
that
ought
to
soften
her
do
you
think
a
big
one
would
do
it
cracknell
kicked
her
on
the
shin
in
a
dismayed
sort
of
way
i
never
thought
of
that
perhaps
you
right
but
it
too
late
now
still
it
might
or
would
it
which
do
you
think
yes
said
sally
i
thought
as
much
said
cracknell
the
orchestra
stopped
with
a
thump
and
a
bang
leaving
cracknell
clapping
feebly
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
sally
slipped
back
to
her
table
her
late
partner
after
an
uncertain
glance
about
him
as
if
he
had
mislaid
something
but
could
not
remember
what
zigzagged
off
in
search
of
his
own
seat
the
noise
of
many
conversations
drowned
by
the
music
broke
out
with
renewed
vigour
the
hot
close
air
was
full
of
voices
and
sally
pressing
her
hands
on
her
closed
eyes
was
reminded
once
more
that
she
had
a
headache
nearly
a
month
had
passed
since
her
return
to
abrahams
employment
it
had
been
a
dull
leaden
month
a
monotonous
succession
of
lifeless
days
during
which
life
had
become
a
bad
dream
in
some
strange
nightmare
fashion
she
seemed
nowadays
to
be
cut
off
from
her
kind
it
was
weeks
since
she
had
seen
a
familiar
face
none
of
the
companions
of
her
old
days
had
crossed
her
path
fillmore
no
doubt
from
uneasiness
of
conscience
had
not
sought
her
out
and
ginger
was
working
out
his
destiny
on
the
south
shore
of
long
island
she
lowered
her
hands
and
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
room
it
was
crowded
as
always
the
flower
garden
was
one
of
the
many
establishments
of
the
same
kind
which
had
swum
to
popularity
on
the
rising
flood
of
new
york
dancing
craze
and
doubtless
because
as
its
proprietor
had
claimed
it
was
a
nice
place
and
run
nice
it
had
continued
unlike
many
of
its
rivals
to
enjoy
unvarying
prosperity
in
its
advertisement
it
described
itself
as
a
for
dining
and
dancing
adding
that
large
and
spacious
and
sumptuously
appointed
it
was
one
of
the
town
with
its
incomparable
enchanting
music
cuisine
and
service
de
from
which
it
may
be
gathered
even
without
his
personal
statements
to
that
effect
that
isadore
abrahams
thought
well
of
the
place
there
had
been
a
time
when
sally
had
liked
it
too
in
her
first
period
of
employment
there
she
had
found
it
diverting
stimulating
and
full
of
entertainment
but
in
those
days
she
had
never
had
headaches
or
what
was
worse
this
dreadful
listless
depression
which
weighed
her
down
and
made
her
nightly
work
a
burden
miss
the
orchestra
never
silent
for
long
at
the
flower
garden
had
started
again
and
lee
schoenstein
the
master
of
ceremonies
was
presenting
a
new
partner
she
got
up
mechanically
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
in
this
place
said
the
man
as
they
bumped
over
the
crowded
floor
he
was
big
and
clumsy
of
course
it
seemed
to
sally
that
the
whole
world
was
big
and
clumsy
it
a
swell
place
i
come
from
myself
we
got
nothing
like
this
where
i
come
he
cleared
a
space
before
him
using
sally
as
a
and
sally
though
she
had
not
enjoyed
her
recent
excursion
with
cracknell
now
began
to
look
back
to
it
almost
with
wistfulness
this
man
was
undoubtedly
the
worst
dancer
in
america
give
me
old
new
york
said
the
man
from
unpatriotically
it
good
enough
for
me
i
been
to
some
swell
shows
since
i
got
to
town

seen
this
year

said
the
man
earnestly
you

take
it
from
me

a
swell
show
you
seen
takes
a
turkish
bath
i
do
go
to
many
you
go
it
a
scream
i
been
to
a
show
every
night
since
i
got
here
every
night
regular
swell
shows
all
of
except
this
last
one
i
picked
a
lemon
all
right
i
was
taking
a
chance
because
it
was
an
opening
thought
it
would
be
something
to
say
when
i
got
home
that
i
been
to
a
new
york
opening
set
me
back
including
tax
and
i
wish
i
got
it
in
my
kick
right
now
wild
rose
they
called
it
he
said
satirically
as
if
exposing
a
low
subterfuge
on
the
part
of
the
management
wild
rose
it
sure
made
me
wild
all
right
two
dollars
tossed
away
just
like
something
stirred
in
sally
memory
why
did
that
title
seem
so
familiar
then
with
a
shock
she
remembered
it
was
gerald
new
play
for
some
time
after
her
return
to
new
york
she
had
been
haunted
by
the
fear
lest
coming
out
of
her
apartment
she
might
meet
him
coming
out
of
his
and
then
she
had
seen
a
paragraph
in
her
morning
paper
which
had
relieved
her
of
this
apprehension
gerald
was
out
on
the
road
with
a
new
play
and
the
wild
rose
she
was
almost
sure
was
the
name
of
it
is
that
gerald
foster
play
she
asked
quickly
i
do
know
who
wrote
it
said
her
partner
but
let
me
tell
you
one
lucky
guy
to
get
away
alive
there
fellows
breaking
stones
on
the
ossining
road
that
done
a
lot
less
to
deserve
a
sentence
wild
rose
i
tell
the
world
it
made
me
go
good
and
wild
said
the
man
from
an
economical
soul
who
disliked
waste
and
was
accustomed
to
spread
out
his
humorous
efforts
so
as
to
give
them
every
chance
why
before
the
second
act
was
over
the
people
were
beating
it
for
the
exits
and
if
it
had
been
for
someone
shouting
and
children
first
there
have
been
a
sally
found
herself
back
at
her
table
without
knowing
clearly
how
she
had
got
there
miss
she
started
to
rise
and
was
aware
suddenly
that
this
was
not
the
voice
of
duty
calling
her
once
more
through
the
gold
teeth
of
schoenstein
the
man
who
had
spoken
her
name
had
seated
himself
beside
her
and
was
talking
in
precise
clipped
accents
oddly
familiar
the
mist
cleared
from
her
eyes
and
she
recognized
bruce
carmyle
i
called
at
your
place
carmyle
was
saying
and
the
hall
porter
told
me
that
you
were
here
so
i
ventured
to
follow
you
i
hope
you
do
not
mind
may
i
smoke
he
lit
a
cigarette
with
something
of
an
air
his
fingers
trembled
as
he
raised
the
match
but
he
flattered
himself
that
there
was
nothing
else
in
his
demeanour
to
indicate
that
he
was
violently
excited
bruce
carmyle
ideal
was
the
strong
man
who
can
rise
superior
to
his
emotions
he
was
alive
to
the
fact
that
this
was
an
embarrassing
moment
but
he
was
determined
not
to
show
that
he
appreciated
it
he
cast
a
sideways
glance
at
sally
and
thought
that
never
not
even
in
the
garden
at
monk
crofton
on
a
certain
momentous
occasion
had
he
seen
her
looking
prettier
her
face
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
aflame
the
stout
wraith
of
uncle
donald
which
had
accompanied
carmyle
on
this
expedition
of
his
faded
into
nothingness
as
he
gazed
there
was
a
pause
carmyle
having
lighted
his
cigarette
puffed
vigorously
when
did
you
land
asked
sally
feeling
the
need
of
saying
something
her
mind
was
confused
she
could
not
have
said
whether
she
was
glad
or
sorry
that
he
was
there
glad
she
thought
on
the
whole
there
was
something
in
his
dark
cool
stiff
english
aspect
that
gave
her
a
curious
feeling
of
relief
he
was
so
unlike
cracknell
and
the
man
from
and
so
calmly
remote
from
the
feverish
atmosphere
in
which
she
lived
her
nights
that
it
was
restful
to
look
at
him
i
landed
said
bruce
carmyle
turning
and
faced
her
squarely
we
docked
at
he
turned
away
again
he
had
made
his
effect
and
was
content
to
leave
her
to
think
it
over
sally
was
silent
the
significance
of
his
words
had
not
escaped
her
she
realized
that
his
presence
there
was
a
challenge
which
she
must
answer
and
yet
it
hardly
stirred
her
she
had
been
fighting
so
long
and
she
felt
utterly
inert
she
was
like
a
swimmer
who
can
battle
no
longer
and
prepares
to
yield
to
the
numbness
of
exhaustion
the
heat
of
the
room
pressed
down
on
her
like
a
smothering
blanket
her
tired
nerves
cried
out
under
the
blare
of
music
and
the
clatter
of
voices
shall
we
dance
this
he
asked
the
orchestra
had
started
to
play
again
a
sensuous
creamy
melody
which
was
making
the
most
of
its
brief
reign
as
broadway
leading
overfamiliar
to
her
from
a
hundred
repetitions
if
you
efficiency
was
bruce
carmyle
gospel
he
was
one
of
these
men
who
do
not
attempt
anything
which
they
can
not
accomplish
to
perfection
dancing
he
had
decided
early
in
his
life
was
a
part
of
a
education
and
he
had
seen
to
it
that
he
was
educated
thoroughly
sally
who
as
they
swept
out
on
to
the
floor
had
braced
herself
automatically
for
a
repetition
of
the
usual
bumping
struggle
which
dancing
at
the
flower
garden
had
come
to
mean
for
her
found
herself
in
the
arms
of
a
masterful
expert
a
man
who
danced
better
than
she
did
and
suddenly
there
came
to
her
a
feeling
that
was
almost
gratitude
a
miraculous
slackening
of
her
taut
nerves
a
delicious
peace
soothed
and
contented
she
yielded
herself
with
eyes
half
closed
to
the
rhythm
of
the
melody
finding
it
now
robbed
in
some
mysterious
manner
of
all
its
stale
cheapness
and
in
that
moment
her
whole
attitude
towards
bruce
carmyle
underwent
a
complete
change
she
had
never
troubled
to
examine
with
any
minuteness
her
feelings
towards
him
but
one
thing
she
had
known
clearly
since
their
first
meeting
that
he
was
physically
distasteful
to
her
for
all
his
good
looks
and
in
his
rather
sinister
way
he
was
a
handsome
man
she
had
shrunk
from
him
now
spirited
away
by
the
magic
of
the
dance
that
repugnance
had
left
her
it
was
as
if
some
barrier
had
been
broken
down
between
them
sally
she
felt
his
arm
tighten
about
her
the
muscles
quivering
she
caught
sight
of
his
face
his
dark
eyes
suddenly
blazed
into
hers
and
she
stumbled
with
an
odd
feeling
of
helplessness
realizing
with
a
shock
that
brought
her
with
a
jerk
out
of
the
into
which
she
had
been
lulled
that
this
dance
had
not
postponed
the
moment
of
decision
as
she
had
looked
to
it
to
do
in
a
hot
whisper
the
words
swept
away
on
the
flood
of
the
music
which
had
suddenly
become
raucous
and
blaring
once
more
he
was
repeating
what
he
had
said
under
the
trees
at
crofton
on
that
morning
in
the
english
springtime
dizzily
she
knew
that
she
was
resenting
the
unfairness
of
the
attack
at
such
a
moment
but
her
mind
seemed
numbed
the
music
stopped
abruptly
insistent
clapping
started
it
again
but
sally
moved
away
to
her
table
and
he
followed
her
like
a
shadow
neither
spoke
bruce
carmyle
had
said
his
say
and
sally
was
sitting
staring
before
her
trying
to
think
she
was
tired
tired
her
eyes
were
burning
she
tried
to
force
herself
to
face
the
situation
squarely
was
it
worth
struggling
was
anything
in
the
world
worth
a
struggle
she
only
knew
that
she
was
tired
desperately
tired
tired
to
the
very
depths
of
her
soul
the
music
stopped
there
was
more
clapping
but
this
time
the
orchestra
did
not
respond
gradually
the
floor
emptied
the
shuffling
of
feet
ceased
the
flower
garden
was
as
quiet
as
it
was
ever
able
to
be
even
the
voices
of
the
babblers
seemed
strangely
hushed
sally
closed
her
eyes
and
as
she
did
so
from
somewhere
up
near
the
roof
there
came
the
song
of
a
bird
isadore
abrahams
was
a
man
of
his
word
he
advertised
a
flower
garden
and
he
had
tried
to
give
the
public
something
as
closely
resembling
a
as
it
was
possible
for
an
overcrowded
overheated
overnoisy
broadway
to
achieve
paper
roses
festooned
the
walls
genuine
tulips
bloomed
in
tubs
by
every
pillar
and
from
the
roof
hung
cages
with
birds
in
them
one
of
these
stirred
by
the
sudden
cessation
of
the
tumult
below
had
began
to
sing
sally
had
often
pitied
these
birds
and
more
than
once
had
pleaded
in
vain
with
abrahams
for
a
remission
of
their
sentence
but
somehow
at
this
moment
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
this
one
was
merely
praying
in
its
own
language
as
she
often
had
prayed
in
her
thoughts
to
be
taken
out
of
this
place
to
her
sitting
there
wrestling
with
fate
the
song
seemed
cheerful
it
soothed
her
it
healed
her
to
listen
to
it
and
suddenly
before
her
eyes
there
rose
a
vision
of
monk
crofton
cool
green
and
peaceful
under
the
mild
english
sun
luring
her
as
an
oasis
seen
in
the
distance
lures
the
desert
traveller
she
became
aware
that
the
master
of
monk
crofton
had
placed
his
hand
on
hers
and
was
holding
it
in
a
tightening
grip
she
looked
down
and
gave
a
little
shiver
she
had
always
disliked
bruce
carmyle
hands
they
were
strong
and
bony
and
black
hair
grew
on
the
back
of
them
one
of
the
earliest
feelings
regarding
him
had
been
that
she
would
hate
to
have
those
hands
touching
her
but
she
did
not
move
again
that
vision
of
the
old
garden
had
flickered
across
her
mind
a
haven
where
she
could
rest
he
was
leaning
towards
her
whispering
in
her
ear
the
room
was
hotter
than
it
had
ever
been
noisier
than
it
had
ever
been
fuller
than
it
had
ever
been
the
bird
on
the
roof
was
singing
again
and
now
she
understood
what
it
said
take
me
out
of
this
did
anything
matter
except
that
what
did
it
matter
how
one
was
taken
or
where
or
by
whom
so
that
one
was
taken
monk
crofton
was
looking
cool
and
green
and
peaceful
very
well
said
sally
bruce
carmyle
in
the
capacity
of
accepted
suitor
found
himself
at
something
of
a
loss
he
had
a
dissatisfied
feeling
it
was
not
the
manner
of
sally
acceptance
that
caused
this
it
would
of
course
have
pleased
him
better
if
she
had
shown
more
warmth
but
he
was
prepared
to
wait
for
warmth
what
did
trouble
him
was
the
fact
that
his
correct
mind
perceived
now
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
chosen
an
unsuitable
moment
and
place
for
his
outburst
of
emotion
he
belonged
to
the
orthodox
school
of
thought
which
looks
on
moonlight
and
solitude
as
the
proper
setting
for
a
proposal
of
marriage
and
the
surroundings
of
the
flower
garden
for
all
its
and
the
nice
manner
in
which
it
was
conducted
jarred
upon
him
profoundly
music
had
begun
again
but
it
was
not
the
soft
music
such
as
a
lover
demands
if
he
is
to
give
of
his
best
it
was
a
brassy
clashy
rendering
of
a
ribald
enough
to
choke
the
eloquence
of
the
most
ardent
couples
were
dipping
and
swaying
and
bumping
into
one
another
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
while
just
behind
him
two
waiters
had
halted
in
order
to
thrash
out
one
of
those
voluble
arguments
in
which
waiters
love
to
indulge
to
continue
the
scene
at
the
proper
emotional
level
was
impossible
and
bruce
carmyle
began
his
career
as
an
engaged
man
by
dropping
into
smalltalk
deuce
of
a
lot
of
noise
he
said
querulously
yes
agreed
sally
is
it
always
like
this
oh
infernal
racket
the
romantic
side
of
carmyle
nature
could
have
cried
aloud
at
the
hideous
unworthiness
of
these
banalities
in
the
visions
which
he
had
had
of
himself
as
a
successful
wooer
it
had
always
been
in
the
moments
immediately
succeeding
the
question
and
its
whispered
reply
that
he
had
come
out
particularly
strong
he
had
been
accustomed
to
picture
himself
bending
with
a
proud
tenderness
over
his
partner
in
the
scene
and
murmuring
some
notably
good
things
to
her
bowed
head
how
could
any
man
murmur
in
a
pandemonium
like
this
from
tenderness
bruce
carmyle
descended
with
a
sharp
swoop
to
irritability
do
you
often
come
here
what
for
to
carmyle
chafed
helplessly
the
scene
which
should
be
so
romantic
had
suddenly
reminded
him
of
the
occasion
when
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
had
attended
his
first
ball
and
had
sat
in
a
corner
behind
a
potted
palm
perspiring
shyly
and
endeavouring
to
make
conversation
to
a
formidable
nymph
in
pink
it
was
one
of
the
few
occasions
in
his
life
at
which
he
had
ever
been
at
a
complete
disadvantage
he
could
still
remember
the
clammy
discomfort
of
his
too
high
collar
as
it
melted
on
him
most
certainly
it
was
not
a
scene
which
he
enjoyed
recalling
and
that
he
should
be
forced
to
recall
it
now
at
what
ought
to
have
been
the
supreme
moment
of
his
life
annoyed
him
intensely
almost
angrily
he
endeavoured
to
jerk
the
conversation
to
a
higher
level
darling
he
murmured
for
by
moving
his
chair
two
feet
to
the
right
and
bending
sideways
he
found
that
he
was
in
a
position
to
murmur
you
have
made
me
so
batti
batti
i
presto
ravioli

cried
one
of
the
disputing
waiters
at
his
back
or
to
bruce
carmyle
prejudiced
hearing
it
sounded
like
that
la
donna
e
mobile
spaghetti

rejoined
the
second
waiter
with
spirit
you
have
made
me
so

the

waiter

said
the
second
waiter
clinchingly
and
scored
a
technical
knockout
bruce
carmyle
gave
it
up
and
lit
a
moody
cigarette
he
was
oppressed
by
that
feeling
which
so
many
of
us
have
felt
in
our
time
that
it
was
all
wrong
the
music
stopped
the
two
leading
citizens
of
little
italy
vanished
and
went
their
way
probably
to
start
a
vendetta
there
followed
comparative
calm
but
bruce
carmyle
emotions
like
sweet
bells
jangled
were
out
of
tune
and
he
could
not
recapture
the
first
fine
careless
rapture
he
found
nothing
within
him
but
what
has
become
of
your
party
he
asked
my
party
the
people
you
are
with
said
carmyle
even
in
the
stress
of
his
emotion
this
problem
had
been
exercising
him
in
his
correctly
ordered
world
girls
did
not
go
to
restaurants
alone
i
not
with
you
came
here
by
yourself
exclaimed
bruce
carmyle
frankly
aghast
and
as
he
spoke
the
wraith
of
uncle
donald
banished
till
now
returned
as
large
as
ever
puffing
disapproval
through
a
walrus
moustache
i
am

said
sally
carmyle
started
violently
employed
here
as
a
dancer
you
know
i
sally
broke
off
her
attention
abruptly
diverted
to
something
which
had
just
caught
her
eye
at
a
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
that
something
was
a
young
man
of
sturdy
build
who
had
just
appeared
beside
the
chair
in
which
reginald
cracknell
was
sitting
in
huddled
gloom
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
basket
and
from
this
basket
rising
above
the
din
of
conversation
there
came
a
sudden
sharp
yapping
cracknell
roused
himself
from
his
stupor
took
the
basket
raised
the
lid
the
yapping
increased
in
volume
cracknell
rose
the
basket
in
his
arms
with
uncertain
steps
and
a
look
on
his
face
like
that
of
those
who
lead
forlorn
hopes
he
crossed
the
floor
to
where
miss
mabel
hobson
sat
proud
and
aloof
the
next
moment
that
haughty
lady
the
centre
of
an
admiring
and
curious
crowd
was
hugging
to
her
bosom
a
protesting
pekingese
puppy
and
cracknell
seizing
his
opportunity
like
a
good
general
had
deposited
himself
in
a
chair
at
her
side
the
course
of
true
love
was
running
smooth
again
the
young
man
was
gazing
fixedly
at
sally
as
a
dancer
ejaculated
carmyle
of
all
those
within
sight
of
the
moving
drama
which
had
just
taken
place
he
alone
had
paid
no
attention
to
it
replete
as
it
was
with
human
interest
the
punch
and
all
the
other
qualities
which
a
drama
should
possess
it
had
failed
to
grip
him
his
thoughts
had
been
elsewhere
the
accusing
figure
of
uncle
donald
refused
to
vanish
from
his
mental
eye
the
stern
voice
of
uncle
donald
seemed
still
to
ring
in
his
ear
a
dancer
a
professional
dancer
at
a
broadway
restaurant
hideous
doubts
began
to
creep
like
snakes
into
bruce
carmyle
mind
what
he
asked
himself
did
he
really
know
of
this
girl
on
whom
he
had
bestowed
the
priceless
boon
of
his
society
for
life
how
did
he
know
what
she
was
he
could
not
find
the
exact
adjective
to
express
his
meaning
but
he
knew
what
he
meant
was
she
worthy
of
the
boon
that
was
what
it
amounted
to
all
his
life
he
had
had
a
prim
shrinking
from
the
section
of
the
feminine
world
which
is
connected
with
the
of
large
cities
club
acquaintances
of
his
in
london
had
from
time
to
time
married
into
the
gaiety
chorus
and
carmyle
though
he
had
no
objection
to
the
gaiety
chorus
in
its
proper
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
footlights
had
always
looked
on
these
young
men
after
as
social
outcasts
the
fine
dashing
frenzy
which
had
brought
him
all
the
way
from
south
audley
street
to
win
sally
was
ebbing
fast
sally
hearing
him
speak
had
turned
and
there
was
a
candid
honesty
in
her
gaze
which
for
a
moment
sent
all
those
creeping
doubts
scuttling
away
into
the
darkness
whence
they
had
come
he
had
not
made
a
fool
of
himself
he
protested
to
the
lowering
phantom
of
uncle
donald
who
he
demanded
could
look
at
sally
and
think
for
an
instant
that
she
was
not
all
that
was
perfect
and
lovable
a
warm
revulsion
of
feeling
swept
over
bruce
carmyle
like
a
returning
tide
you
see
i
lost
my
money
and
had
to
do
something
said
sally
i
see
i
see
murmured
carmyle
and
if
only
fate
had
left
him
alone
who
knows
to
what
heights
of
tenderness
he
might
not
have
soared
but
at
this
moment
fate
being
no
respecter
of
persons
sent
into
his
life
the
disturbing
personality
of
george
washington
williams
george
washington
williams
was
the
talented
coloured
gentleman
who
had
been
extracted
from
vaudeville
by
abrahams
to
do
a
nightly
speciality
at
the
flower
garden
he
was
in
fact
a
and
it
was
his
amiable
practice
after
he
had
done
a
few
minutes
to
rise
from
his
seat
and
make
a
circular
tour
of
the
tables
on
the
edge
of
the
whimsically
pretending
to
clip
the
locks
of
the
male
patrons
with
a
pair
of
drumsticks
held
and
so
it
came
about
that
just
as
carmyle
was
bending
towards
sally
in
an
access
of
manly
sentiment
and
was
on
the
very
verge
of
pouring
out
his
soul
in
a
series
of
remarks
he
was
surprised
and
annoyed
to
find
an
ethiopian
to
whom
he
had
never
been
introduced
leaning
over
him
and
taking
quite
unpardonable
liberties
with
his
back
hair
one
says
that
carmyle
was
annoyed
the
word
is
weak
the
interruption
coming
at
such
a
moment
jarred
every
ganglion
in
his
body
the
clicking
noise
of
the
drumsticks
maddened
him
and
the
gleaming
whiteness
of
williams
friendly
and
benignant
smile
was
the
last
straw
his
dignity
writhed
beneath
this
abominable
infliction
people
at
other
tables
were
laughing
at
him
a
loathing
for
the
flower
garden
flowed
over
bruce
carmyle
and
with
it
a
feeling
of
suspicion
and
disapproval
of
everyone
connected
with
the
establishment
he
sprang
to
his
feet
i
think
i
will
be
going
he
said
sally
did
not
reply
she
was
watching
ginger
who
still
stood
beside
the
table
recently
vacated
by
reginald
cracknell
good
night
said
carmyle
between
his
teeth
oh
are
you
going
said
sally
with
a
start
she
felt
embarrassed
try
as
she
would
she
was
unable
to
find
words
of
any
intimacy
she
tried
to
realize
that
she
had
promised
to
marry
this
man
but
never
before
had
he
seemed
so
much
a
stranger
to
her
so
little
a
part
of
her
life
it
came
to
her
with
a
sensation
of
the
incredible
that
she
had
done
this
thing
taken
this
irrevocable
step
the
sudden
sight
of
ginger
had
shaken
her
it
was
as
though
in
the
last
she
had
forgotten
him
and
only
now
realized
what
marriage
with
bruce
carmyle
would
mean
to
their
comradeship
from
now
on
he
was
dead
to
her
if
anything
in
this
world
was
certain
that
was
sally
nicholas
was
ginger
pal
but
carmyle
she
realized
would
never
be
allowed
to
see
him
again
a
devastating
feeling
of
loss
smote
her
like
a
blow
yes
i
had
enough
of
this
place
bruce
carmyle
was
saying
good
night
said
sally
she
hesitated
when
shall
i
see
you
she
asked
awkwardly
it
occurred
to
bruce
carmyle
that
he
was
not
showing
himself
at
his
best
he
had
he
perceived
allowed
his
nerves
to
run
away
with
him
you
do
mind
if
i
go
he
said
more
amiably
the
fact
is
i
stand
this
place
any
longer
i
tell
you
one
thing
i
going
to
take
you
out
of
here
i
afraid
i
ca
leave
at
a
moment
notice
said
sally
loyal
to
her
obligations
we
talk
over
that
i
call
for
you
in
the
morning
and
take
you
for
a
drive
somewhere
in
a
car
you
want
some
fresh
air
after
carmyle
looked
about
him
in
stiff
disgust
and
expressed
his
unalterable
sentiments
concerning
the
flower
garden
that
apple
of
isadore
abrahams
eye
in
a
snort
of
loathing
my
god
what
a
place
he
walked
quickly
away
and
disappeared
and
ginger
beaming
happily
swooped
on
sally
table
like
a
homing
pigeon
good
lord
i
say
what
ho
cried
ginger
fancy
meeting
you
here
what
a
bit
of
luck
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
warily
has
that
blighter
pipped
pipped
popped
explained
ginger
i
mean
to
say
he
is
coming
back
or
any
rot
like
that
is
he
mr
carmyle
no
he
has
sound
egg
said
ginger
with
satisfaction
for
a
moment
when
i
saw
you
yarning
away
together
i
thought
he
might
be
with
your
party
what
on
earth
is
he
doing
over
here
at
all
confound
him
he
got
all
europe
to
play
about
in
why
should
he
come
infesting
new
york
i
say
it
really
is
ripping
seeing
you
again
it
seems
years
of
course
one
get
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
writing
letters
but
it
not
the
same
besides
i
write
such
rotten
letters
i
say
this
really
is
rather
priceless
ca
i
get
you
something
a
cup
of
coffee
i
mean
or
an
egg
or
something
by
jove
this
really
is
his
homely
honest
face
glowed
with
pleasure
and
it
seemed
to
sally
as
though
she
had
come
out
of
a
winter
night
into
a
warm
friendly
room
her
mercurial
spirits
soared
oh
ginger
if
you
knew
what
it
like
seeing
you
no
really
do
you
mean
honestly
you
braced
i
should
say
i
am
well
is
that
fine
i
was
afraid
you
might
have
forgotten
forgotten
you
with
something
of
the
effect
of
a
revelation
it
suddenly
struck
sally
how
far
she
had
been
from
forgetting
him
how
large
was
the
place
he
had
occupied
in
her
thoughts
i
missed
you
dreadfully
she
said
and
felt
the
words
inadequate
as
she
uttered
them
what
ho
said
ginger
also
internally
condemning
the
poverty
of
speech
as
a
vehicle
for
conveying
thought
there
was
a
brief
silence
the
first
exhilaration
of
the
reunion
over
sally
deep
down
in
her
heart
was
aware
of
a
troubled
feeling
as
though
the
world
were
out
of
joint
she
forced
herself
to
ignore
it
but
it
would
not
be
ignored
it
grew
dimly
she
was
beginning
to
realize
what
ginger
meant
to
her
and
she
fought
to
keep
herself
from
realizing
it
strange
things
were
happening
to
her
strange
emotions
stirring
her
ginger
seemed
somehow
different
as
if
she
were
really
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
you
looking
wonderfully
well
she
said
trying
to
keep
the
conversation
on
a
pedestrian
level
i
am
well
said
ginger
never
felt
fitter
in
my
life
been
out
in
the
open
all
day
long
simple
life
and
all
that
working
like
blazes
i
say
business
is
booming
did
you
see
me
just
now
handing
over
percy
the
pup
to
five
hundred
dollars
on
that
one
deal
got
the
cheque
in
my
pocket
but
what
an
extraordinarily
rummy
thing
that
i
should
have
come
to
this
place
to
deliver
the
goods
just
when
you
happened
to
be
here
i
could
believe
my
eyes
at
first
i
say
i
hope
the
people
you
with
wo
think
i
butting
in
you
have
to
explain
that
we
old
pals
and
that
you
started
me
in
business
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
look
here
he
said
lowering
his
voice
i
know
how
you
hate
being
thanked
but
i
simply
must
say
how
terrifically
decent
miss
lee
schoenstein
was
standing
at
the
table
and
by
his
side
an
expectant
youth
with
a
small
moustache
and
sally
got
up
and
the
next
moment
ginger
was
alone
gaping
perplexedly
after
her
as
she
vanished
and
reappeared
in
the
jogging
throng
on
the
dancing
floor
it
was
the
nearest
thing
ginger
had
seen
to
a
conjuring
trick
and
at
that
moment
he
was
to
conjuring
tricks
he
brooded
fuming
at
what
seemed
to
him
the
supremest
exhibition
of
pure
cheek
of
monumental
nerve
and
of
undiluted
crust
that
had
ever
come
within
his
notice
to
come
and
charge
into
a
private
conversation
like
that
and
whisk
her
away
without
a
word
who
was
that
blighter
he
demanded
with
heat
when
the
music
ceased
and
sally
limped
back
that
was
and
who
was
the
other
the
one
i
danced
with
i
do
you
do
know
sally
perceived
that
the
conversation
had
arrived
at
an
embarrassing
point
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
candour
ginger
she
said
you
remember
my
telling
you
when
we
first
met
that
i
used
to
dance
in
a
broadway
place
this
is
the
place
i
working
complete
unintelligence
showed
itself
on
ginger
every
feature
i
do
understand
he
said
unnecessarily
for
his
face
revealed
the
fact
i
got
my
old
job
but
why
well
i
had
to
do
she
went
on
rapidly
already
a
light
dimly
resembling
the
light
of
understanding
was
beginning
to
appear
in
ginger
eyes
fillmore
went
smash
you
know
it
was
his
fault
poor
dear
he
had
the
worst
kind
of
luck
and
most
of
my
money
was
tied
up
in
his
business
so
you
see
she
broke
off
confused
by
the
look
in
his
eyes
conscious
of
an
absurd
feeling
of
guilt
there
was
amazement
in
that
look
and
a
sort
of
incredulous
horror
do
you
mean
to
say
ginger
gulped
and
started
again
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
let
me
have
all
that
money
for
the
when
you
were
broke
do
you
mean
to
say
sally
stole
a
glance
at
his
crimson
face
and
looked
away
again
quickly
there
was
an
electric
silence
look
here
exploded
ginger
with
sudden
violence
you
got
to
marry
me
you
jolly
well
got
to
marry
me
i
do
mean
that
he
added
quickly
i
mean
to
say
i
know
you
going
to
marry
whoever
you
please
but
wo
you
marry
me
sally
for
god
sake
have
a
dash
at
it
i
been
keeping
it
in
all
this
time
because
it
seemed
rather
rotten
to
bother
you
about
it
but
now
dammit
i
wish
i
could
put
it
into
words
i
always
was
rotten
at
talking
but
well
look
here
what
i
mean
is
i
know
i
not
much
of
a
chap
but
it
seems
to
me
you
must
care
for
me
a
bit
to
do
a
thing
like
that
for
a
fellow
and
i
loved
you
like
the
dickens
ever
since
i
met
you
i
do
wish
have
a
stab
at
it
sally
at
least
i
could
look
after
you
you
know
and
all
that
i
mean
to
say
work
like
the
deuce
and
try
to
give
you
a
good
time
i
not
such
an
ass
as
to
think
a
girl
like
you
could
ever
really
er
love
a
blighter
like
me
but
sally
laid
her
hand
on
his
ginger
dear
she
said
i
do
love
you
i
ought
to
have
known
it
all
along
but
i
seem
to
be
understanding
myself
for
the
first
she
got
up
and
bent
over
him
for
a
swift
moment
whispering
in
his
ear
i
shall
never
love
anyone
but
you
ginger
will
you
try
to
remember
she
was
moving
away
but
he
caught
at
her
arm
and
stopped
her
sally
she
pulled
her
arm
away
her
face
working
as
she
fought
against
the
tears
that
would
not
keep
back
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
she
said
ginger
your
cousin
carmyle
just
now
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
and
i
said
i
she
was
gone
flitting
among
the
tables
like
some
wild
creature
running
to
its
home
and
ginger
motionless
watched
her
go
the
in
sally
little
was
ringing
jerkily
as
she
let
herself
in
at
the
front
door
she
guessed
who
it
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
and
the
noise
of
the
bell
sounded
to
her
like
the
voice
of
a
friend
in
distress
crying
for
help
without
stopping
to
close
the
door
she
ran
to
the
table
and
unhooked
the
receiver
muffled
plaintive
sounds
were
coming
over
the
wire
hullo
hullo
i
say
hullo
hullo
ginger
said
sally
quietly
an
ejaculation
that
was
half
a
shout
and
half
gurgle
answered
her
sally
is
that
you
yes
here
i
am
i
been
trying
to
get
you
for
i
only
just
come
in
i
walked
there
was
a
pause
yes
well
i
mean
ginger
seemed
to
be
finding
his
usual
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
about
that
you
know
what
you
yes
said
sally
trying
to
keep
her
voice
from
shaking
you
said
again
ginger
vocabulary
failed
him
you
said
you
loved
yes
said
sally
simply
another
odd
sound
floated
over
the
wire
and
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
before
ginger
found
himself
able
to
resume
i
i
well
we
can
talk
about
that
when
we
meet
i
mean
it
no
good
trying
to
say
what
i
think
over
the
i
sort
of
knocked
out
i
never
dreamed
but
i
say
what
did
you
mean
about
bruce
i
told
you
i
told
sally
face
was
twisted
and
the
receiver
shook
in
her
hand
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
i
never
realized
and
now
it
too
good
god
ginger
voice
rose
in
a
sharp
wail
you
ca
mean
you
really
you
do
seriously
intend
to
marry
the
man
i
must
i
but
good
heavens

ginger
vehemently
of

the
plaza

sally
found
herself
laughing
weakly
at
the
plaza
oh
ginger

really
do
want
somebody
to
look
after
you
squandering
your
pennies

tired

and

good
she
hung
up
the
receiver
quickly
to
cut
short
a
fresh
outburst
of
protest
and
as
she
turned
away
a
voice
spoke
behind
her
sally
gerald
foster
was
standing
in
the
doorway
chapter
xvii
sally
lays
a
ghost
the
blood
flowed
slowly
back
into
sally
face
and
her
heart
which
had
leaped
madly
for
an
instant
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
resumed
its
normal
beat
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
over
she
was
surprised
to
find
herself
perfectly
calm
always
when
she
had
imagined
this
meeting
knowing
that
it
would
have
to
take
place
sooner
or
later
she
had
felt
something
akin
to
panic
but
now
that
it
had
actually
occurred
it
hardly
seemed
to
stir
her
the
events
of
the
night
had
left
her
incapable
of
any
violent
emotion
hullo
sally
said
gerald
he
spoke
thickly
and
there
was
a
foolish
smile
on
his
face
as
he
stood
swaying
with
one
hand
on
the
door
he
was
in
his
collarless
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
been
drinking
heavily
his
face
was
white
and
puffy
and
about
him
there
hung
like
a
nimbus
a
sodden
disreputableness
sally
did
not
speak
weighed
down
before
by
a
numbing
exhaustion
she
seemed
now
to
have
passed
into
that
second
phase
in
which
nerves
enter
upon
a
sort
of
indian
summer
of
abnormal
alertness
she
looked
at
him
quietly
coolly
and
altogether
dispassionately
as
if
he
had
been
a
stranger
hullo
said
gerald
again
what
do
you
want
said
sally
heard
your
voice
saw
the
door
open
thought
i
come
what
do
you
want
the
weak
smile
which
had
seemed
pinned
on
gerald
face
vanished
a
tear
rolled
down
his
cheek
his
intoxication
had
reached
the
maudlin
stage
sally
i
very
he
slurred
awkwardly
over
the
difficult
syllables
heard
your
voice
saw
the
door
open
thought
come
something
flicked
at
the
back
of
sally
mind
she
seemed
to
have
been
through
all
this
before
then
she
remembered
this
was
simply
reginald
cracknell
over
again
i
think
you
had
better
go
to
bed
gerald
she
said
steadily
nothing
about
him
seemed
to
touch
her
now
neither
the
sight
of
him
nor
his
shameless
misery
what
the
use
ca
sleep
no
good
could
sleep
sally
you
know
how
worried
i
am
i
see
what
a
fool
i
sally
made
a
quick
gesture
to
check
what
she
supposed
was
about
to
develop
into
a
belated
expression
of
regret
for
his
treatment
of
herself
she
did
not
want
to
stand
there
listening
to
gerald
apologizing
with
tears
for
having
done
his
best
to
wreck
her
life
but
it
seemed
that
it
was
not
this
that
was
weighing
upon
his
soul
i
was
a
fool
ever
to
try
writing
plays
he
went
on
got
a
winner
first
time
but
ca
repeat
it
no
good
ought
to
have
stuck
to
newspaper
work
i
good
at
that
shall
have
to
go
back
to
it
had
another
frost
no
good
trying
any
more
shall
have
to
go
back
to
the
old
grind
damn
he
wept
softly
full
of
pity
for
his
hard
case
very
miserable
he
murmured
he
came
forward
a
step
into
the
room
lurched
and
retreated
to
the
safe
support
of
the
door
for
an
instant
sally
artificial
calm
was
shot
through
by
a
swift
stab
of
contempt
it
passed
and
she
was
back
again
in
her
armour
of
indifference
go
to
bed
gerald
she
said
you
feel
better
in
the
perhaps
some
inkling
of
how
he
was
going
to
feel
in
the
morning
worked
through
to
gerald
muddled
intelligence
for
he
winced
and
his
manner
took
on
a
deeper
melancholy
may
not
be
alive
in
the
morning
he
said
solemnly
good
mind
to
end
it
all
end
it
all
he
repeated
with
the
beginning
of
a
sweeping
gesture
which
was
cut
off
abruptly
as
he
clutched
at
the
friendly
door
sally
was
not
in
the
mood
for
melodrama
oh
go
to
bed
she
said
impatiently
the
strange
frozen
indifference
which
had
gripped
her
was
beginning
to
pass
leaving
in
its
place
a
growing
feeling
of
resentment
resentment
against
gerald
for
degrading
himself
like
this
against
herself
for
ever
having
found
glamour
in
the
man
it
humiliated
her
to
remember
how
utterly
she
had
once
allowed
his
personality
to
master
hers
and
under
the
sting
of
this
humiliation
she
felt
hard
and
pitiless
dimly
she
was
aware
that
a
curious
change
had
come
over
her
normally
the
sight
of
any
living
thing
in
distress
was
enough
to
stir
her
quick
sympathy
but
gerald
mourning
over
the
prospect
of
having
to
go
back
to
regular
work
made
no
appeal
to
her
a
fact
which
the
sufferer
noted
and
commented
upon
you
very
unsymp
unsympathetic
he
complained
i
sorry
said
sally
she
walked
briskly
to
the
door
and
gave
it
a
push
gerald
still
clinging
to
his
chosen
support
moved
out
into
the
passage
attached
to
the
handle
with
the
air
of
a
man
the
foundations
of
whose
world
have
suddenly
lost
their
stability
he
released
the
handle
and
moved
uncertainly
across
the
passage
finding
his
own
door
open
before
him
he
staggered
over
the
threshold
and
sally
having
watched
him
safely
to
his
journey
end
went
into
her
bedroom
with
the
intention
of
terminating
this
disturbing
night
by
going
to
sleep
almost
immediately
she
changed
her
mind
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
a
fever
of
restlessness
had
come
upon
her
she
put
on
a
kimono
and
went
into
the
kitchen
to
ascertain
whether
her
commissariat
arrangements
would
permit
of
a
glass
of
hot
milk
she
had
just
remembered
that
she
had
that
morning
presented
the
last
of
the
milk
to
a
sandy
cat
with
a
purposeful
eye
which
had
dropped
in
through
the
window
to
take
breakfast
with
her
when
her
regrets
for
this
thriftless
hospitality
were
interrupted
by
a
muffled
crash
she
listened
intently
the
sound
had
seemed
to
come
from
across
the
passage
she
hurried
to
the
door
and
opened
it
as
she
did
so
from
behind
the
door
of
the
apartment
opposite
there
came
a
perfect
fusillade
of
crashes
each
seeming
to
her
strained
hearing
louder
and
more
appalling
than
the
last
there
is
something
about
sudden
loud
noises
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
which
shatters
the
most
rigid
detachment
a
short
while
before
gerald
toying
with
the
idea
of
ending
his
sorrows
by
violence
had
left
sally
unmoved
but
now
her
mind
leapt
back
to
what
he
had
said
and
apprehension
succeeded
indifference
there
was
no
disputing
the
fact
that
gerald
was
in
an
irresponsible
mood
under
the
influence
of
which
he
was
capable
of
doing
almost
anything
sally
listening
in
the
doorway
felt
a
momentary
panic
a
brief
silence
had
succeeded
the
fusillade
but
as
she
stood
there
hesitating
the
noise
broke
out
again
and
this
time
it
was
so
loud
and
compelling
that
sally
hesitated
no
longer
she
ran
across
the
passage
and
beat
on
the
door
whatever
devastating
happenings
had
been
going
on
in
his
home
it
was
plain
a
moment
later
that
gerald
had
managed
to
survive
them
for
there
came
the
sound
of
a
dragging
footstep
and
the
door
opened
gerald
stood
on
the
threshold
the
weak
smile
back
on
his
face
hullo
sally
at
the
sight
of
him
disreputable
and
obviously
unscathed
brief
alarm
died
away
leaving
in
its
place
the
old
feeling
of
impatient
resentment
in
addition
to
her
other
grievances
against
him
he
had
apparently
frightened
her
unnecessarily
whatever
was
all
that
noise
she
demanded
noise
said
gerald
considering
the
point
yes
noise
snapped
sally
i
been
cleaning
house
said
gerald
with
the
gravity
of
a
man
just
conscious
that
he
is
not
wholly
himself
sally
pushed
her
way
past
him
the
apartment
in
which
she
found
herself
was
almost
an
exact
replica
of
her
own
and
it
was
evident
that
elsa
doland
had
taken
pains
to
make
it
pretty
and
comfortable
in
a
niggly
feminine
way
amateur
interior
decoration
had
always
been
a
hobby
of
hers
even
in
the
unpromising
surroundings
of
her
bedroom
at
meecher
she
had
contrived
to
create
a
certain
daintiness
which
sally
who
had
no
ability
in
that
direction
herself
had
always
rather
envied
as
a
decorator
elsa
mind
ran
in
the
direction
of
small
fragile
ornaments
and
she
was
not
afraid
of
pictures
jostled
one
another
on
the
walls
china
of
all
description
stood
about
on
little
tables
there
was
a
profusion
of
lamps
with
shades
of
glass
and
plates
were
ranged
along
a
series
of
shelves
one
says
that
the
plates
were
ranged
and
the
pictures
jostled
one
another
but
it
would
be
more
correct
to
put
it
they
had
jostled
and
had
been
ranged
for
it
was
only
by
that
sally
was
able
to
reconstruct
the
scene
as
it
must
have
appeared
before
gerald
had
started
as
he
put
it
to
clean
house
she
had
walked
into
the
flat
briskly
enough
but
she
pulled
up
short
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
appalled
by
the
majestic
ruin
that
met
her
gaze
a
shell
bursting
in
the
little
could
hardly
have
created
more
havoc
the
psychology
of
a
man
of
weak
character
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and
disappointed
ambition
is
not
easy
to
plumb
for
his
moods
follow
one
another
with
a
rapidity
which
baffles
the
observer
ten
minutes
before
gerald
foster
had
been
in
the
grip
of
a
clammy
and
it
seemed
from
his
aspect
at
the
present
moment
that
this
phase
had
returned
but
in
the
interval
there
had
manifestly
occurred
a
brief
but
adequate
spasm
of
what
would
appear
to
have
been
an
almost
berserk
fury
what
had
caused
it
and
why
it
should
have
expended
itself
so
abruptly
sally
was
not
psychologist
enough
to
explain
but
that
it
had
existed
there
was
ocular
evidence
of
the
most
convincing
kind
a
heavy
niblick
flung
petulantly
or
remorsefully
into
a
corner
showed
by
what
medium
the
destruction
had
been
accomplished
bleak
chaos
appeared
on
every
side
the
floor
was
littered
with
every
imaginable
shape
and
size
of
broken
glass
and
china
fragments
of
pictures
looking
as
if
they
had
been
chewed
by
some
prehistoric
animal
lay
amid
heaps
of
shattered
statuettes
and
vases
as
sally
moved
slowly
into
the
room
after
her
involuntary
pause
china
crackled
beneath
her
feet
she
surveyed
the
stripped
walls
with
a
wondering
eye
and
turned
to
gerald
for
an
explanation
gerald
had
subsided
on
to
an
occasional
table
and
was
weeping
softly
again
it
had
come
over
him
once
more
that
he
had
been
very
very
badly
treated
well
said
sally
with
a
gasp
you
certainly
made
a
good
job
of
it
there
was
a
sharp
crack
as
the
occasional
table
never
designed
by
its
maker
to
bear
heavy
weights
gave
way
in
a
splintering
flurry
of
broken
legs
under
the
pressure
of
the
master
of
the
house
and
sally
mood
underwent
an
abrupt
change
there
are
few
situations
in
life
which
do
not
hold
equal
potentialities
for
both
tragedy
and
farce
and
it
was
the
ludicrous
side
of
this
drama
that
chanced
to
appeal
to
sally
at
this
moment
her
sense
of
humour
was
tickled
it
was
if
she
could
have
analysed
her
feelings
at
herself
that
she
was
mocking
at
the
feeble
sentimental
sally
who
had
once
conceived
the
absurd
idea
of
taking
this
preposterous
man
seriously
she
felt
and
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
with
a
gurgling
laugh
the
shock
of
his
fall
appeared
to
have
had
the
desirable
effect
of
restoring
gerald
to
something
approaching
intelligence
he
picked
himself
up
from
the
remains
of
a
set
of
gazing
at
sally
with
growing
disapproval
no
sympathy
he
said
austerely
i
ca
help
it
cried
sally
it
too
not
funny
corrected
gerald
his
brain
beginning
to
cloud
once
more
what
did
you
do
it
for
gerald
returned
for
a
moment
to
that
mood
of
honest
indignation
which
had
so
strengthened
his
arm
when
wielding
the
niblick
he
bethought
him
once
again
of
his
grievance
was
going
to
stand
for
it
any
longer
he
said
heatedly
a
wife
goes
and
lets
him
down
ruins
his
show
by
going
off
and
playing
in
another
show
why
should
i
smash
her
things
why
should
i
stand
for
that
sort
of
treatment
why
should
i
well
you
have
said
sally
so
there
no
need
to
discuss
it
you
seem
to
have
acted
in
a
thoroughly
manly
and
independent
that
it
manly
he
waggled
his
finger
impressively
do
care
what
she
says
he
continued
do
care
if
she
never
comes
back
that
woman
sally
was
not
prepared
to
embark
with
him
upon
a
discussion
of
the
absent
elsa
already
the
amusing
aspect
of
the
affair
had
begun
to
fade
and
her
hilarity
was
giving
way
to
a
tired
distaste
for
the
sordidness
of
the
whole
business
she
had
become
aware
that
she
could
not
endure
the
society
of
gerald
foster
much
longer
she
got
up
and
spoke
decidedly
and
now
she
said
i
going
to
tidy
gerald
had
other
views
no
he
said
with
sudden
solemnity
no
nothing
of
the
kind
leave
it
for
her
to
find
leave
it
as
it
do
be
silly
all
this
has
got
to
be
cleaned
up
i
do
it
you
go
and
sit
in
my
apartment
i
come
and
tell
you
when
you
can
come
no
said
gerald
wagging
his
head
sally
stamped
her
foot
among
the
crackling
ruins
quite
suddenly
the
sight
of
him
had
become
intolerable
do
as
i
tell
you
she
cried
gerald
wavered
for
a
moment
but
his
brief
militant
mood
was
ebbing
fast
after
a
faint
protest
he
shuffled
off
and
sally
heard
him
go
into
her
room
she
breathed
a
deep
breath
of
relief
and
turned
to
her
task
a
visit
to
the
kitchen
revealed
a
broom
and
armed
with
this
sally
was
soon
busy
she
was
an
efficient
little
person
and
presently
out
of
chaos
there
began
to
emerge
a
certain
order
nothing
short
of
complete
would
ever
make
the
place
look
habitable
again
but
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
she
had
cleared
the
floor
and
the
fragments
of
vases
plates
pictures
and
glasses
were
stacked
in
tiny
heaps
against
the
walls
she
returned
the
broom
to
the
kitchen
and
going
back
into
the
flung
open
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
with
a
sense
of
unreality
she
perceived
that
the
night
had
gone
over
the
quiet
street
below
there
brooded
that
strange
metallic
light
which
ushers
in
the
dawn
of
a
fine
day
a
cold
breeze
whispered
to
and
fro
above
the
the
sky
was
a
faint
level
blue
she
left
the
window
and
started
to
cross
the
room
and
suddenly
there
came
over
her
a
feeling
of
utter
weakness
she
stumbled
to
a
chair
conscious
only
of
being
tired
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
further
effort
her
eyes
closed
and
almost
before
her
head
had
touched
the
cushions
she
was
asleep
sally
woke
sunshine
was
streaming
through
the
open
window
and
with
it
the
myriad
noises
of
a
city
awake
and
about
its
business
footsteps
clattered
on
the
sidewalk
automobile
horns
were
sounding
and
she
could
hear
the
clank
of
street
cars
as
they
passed
over
the
points
she
could
only
guess
at
the
hour
but
it
was
evident
that
the
morning
was
well
advanced
she
got
up
stiffly
her
head
was
aching
she
went
into
the
bathroom
bathed
her
face
and
felt
better
the
dull
oppression
which
comes
of
a
bad
night
was
leaving
her
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
revelling
in
the
fresh
air
then
crossed
the
passage
and
entered
her
own
apartment
stertorous
breathing
greeted
her
and
she
perceived
that
gerald
foster
had
also
passed
the
night
in
a
chair
he
was
sprawling
by
the
window
with
his
legs
stretched
out
and
his
head
resting
on
one
of
the
arms
an
unlovely
spectacle
sally
stood
regarding
him
for
a
moment
with
a
return
of
the
distaste
which
she
had
felt
on
the
previous
night
and
yet
mingled
with
the
distaste
there
was
a
certain
elation
a
black
chapter
of
her
life
was
closed
for
ever
whatever
the
years
to
come
might
bring
to
her
they
would
be
free
from
any
wistful
yearnings
for
the
man
who
had
once
been
woven
so
inextricably
into
the
fabric
of
her
life
she
had
thought
that
his
personality
had
gripped
her
too
strongly
ever
to
be
dislodged
but
now
she
could
look
at
him
calmly
and
feel
only
a
faint
the
glamour
had
departed
she
shook
him
gently
and
he
sat
up
with
a
start
blinking
in
the
strong
light
his
mouth
was
still
open
he
stared
at
sally
foolishly
then
scrambled
awkwardly
out
of
the
chair
oh
my
god
said
gerald
pressing
both
his
hands
to
his
forehead
and
sitting
down
again
he
licked
his
lips
with
a
dry
tongue
and
moaned
oh
i
got
a
headache
sally
might
have
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
had
certainly
earned
one
but
she
refrained
you
better
go
and
have
a
wash
she
suggested
yes
said
gerald
heaving
himself
up
again
would
you
like
some
breakfast
do
said
gerald
faintly
and
tottered
off
to
the
bathroom
sally
sat
down
in
the
chair
he
had
vacated
she
had
never
felt
quite
like
this
before
in
her
life
everything
seemed
dreamlike
the
splashing
of
water
in
the
bathroom
came
faintly
to
her
and
she
realized
that
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
falling
asleep
again
she
got
up
and
opened
the
window
and
once
more
the
air
acted
as
a
restorative
she
watched
the
activities
of
the
street
with
a
distant
interest
they
too
seemed
dreamlike
and
unreal
people
were
hurrying
up
and
down
on
mysterious
errands
an
inscrutable
cat
picked
its
way
daintily
across
the
road
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
house
an
open
car
purred
sleepily
she
was
roused
by
a
ring
at
the
bell
she
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
found
bruce
carmyle
standing
on
the
threshold
he
wore
a
light
and
he
was
plainly
endeavouring
to
soften
the
severity
of
his
saturnine
face
with
a
smile
of
beaming
kindliness
well
here
i
am
said
bruce
carmyle
cheerily
are
you
ready
with
the
coming
of
daylight
a
certain
penitence
had
descended
on
carmyle
thinking
things
over
while
shaving
and
subsequently
in
his
bath
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
his
behaviour
overnight
had
not
been
all
that
could
have
been
desired
he
had
not
actually
been
brutal
perhaps
but
he
had
undoubtedly
not
been
winning
there
had
been
an
abruptness
in
the
manner
of
his
leaving
sally
at
the
flower
garden
which
a
perfect
lover
ought
not
to
have
shown
he
had
allowed
his
nerves
to
get
the
better
of
him
and
now
he
desired
to
make
amends
hence
a
cheerfulness
which
he
did
not
usually
exhibit
so
early
in
the
morning
sally
was
staring
at
him
blankly
she
had
completely
forgotten
that
he
had
said
that
he
would
come
and
take
her
for
a
drive
this
morning
she
searched
in
her
mind
for
words
and
found
none
and
as
carmyle
was
debating
within
himself
whether
to
kiss
her
now
or
wait
for
a
more
suitable
moment
embarrassment
came
upon
them
both
like
a
fog
and
the
genial
smile
faded
from
his
face
as
if
the
behind
it
had
suddenly
failed
i
er
got
the
car
outside
and
at
this
point
speech
failed
carmyle
for
even
as
he
began
the
sentence
the
door
that
led
to
the
bathroom
opened
and
gerald
foster
came
out
carmyle
gaped
at
gerald
gerald
gaped
at
carmyle
the
application
of
cold
water
to
the
face
and
head
is
an
excellent
thing
on
the
morning
after
an
imprudent
night
but
as
a
tonic
it
only
goes
part
of
the
way
in
the
case
of
gerald
foster
which
was
an
extremely
serious
and
aggravated
case
it
had
gone
hardly
any
way
at
all
the
person
unknown
who
had
been
driving
rivets
into
the
base
of
gerald
foster
skull
ever
since
the
moment
of
his
awakening
was
still
busily
engaged
on
that
task
he
gazed
at
carmyle
wanly
bruce
carmyle
drew
in
his
breath
with
a
sharp
hiss
and
stood
rigid
his
eyes
burning
now
with
a
grim
light
flickered
over
gerald
person
and
found
nothing
in
it
to
entertain
them
he
saw
a
slouching
figure
in
and
the
foundations
of
evening
dress
a
disgusting
degraded
figure
with
pink
eyes
and
a
white
face
that
needed
a
shave
and
all
the
doubts
that
had
ever
come
to
vex
carmyle
mind
since
his
first
meeting
with
sally
became
on
the
instant
certainties
so
uncle
donald
had
been
right
after
all
this
was
the
sort
of
girl
she
was
at
his
elbow
the
stout
phantom
of
uncle
donald
puffed
with
satisfaction
i
told
you
so
it
said
sally
had
not
moved
the
situation
was
beyond
her
just
as
if
this
had
really
been
the
dream
it
seemed
she
felt
incapable
of
speech
or
action
so
said
carmyle
becoming
articulate
and
allowed
an
impressive
aposiopesis
to
take
the
place
of
the
rest
of
the
speech
a
cold
fury
had
gripped
him
he
pointed
at
gerald
began
to
speak
found
that
he
was
stuttering
and
gulped
back
the
words
in
this
supreme
moment
he
was
not
going
to
have
his
dignity
impaired
by
a
stutter
he
gulped
and
found
a
sentence
which
while
brief
enough
to
insure
against
this
disaster
was
sufficiently
long
to
express
his
meaning
get
out
he
said
gerald
foster
had
his
dignity
too
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
time
had
come
to
assert
it
but
he
also
had
a
most
excruciating
headache
and
when
he
drew
himself
up
haughtily
to
ask
carmyle
what
the
devil
he
meant
by
it
a
severe
access
of
pain
sent
him
huddling
back
immediately
to
a
safer
attitude
he
clasped
his
forehead
and
groaned
get
out
for
a
moment
gerald
hesitated
then
another
sudden
shooting
spasm
convinced
him
that
no
profit
or
pleasure
was
to
be
derived
from
a
continuance
of
the
argument
and
he
began
to
shamble
slowly
across
to
the
door
bruce
carmyle
watched
him
go
with
twitching
hands
there
was
a
moment
when
the
human
man
in
him
somewhat
atrophied
from
long
disuse
stirred
him
almost
to
the
point
of
assault
then
dignity
whispered
more
prudent
counsel
in
his
ear
and
gerald
was
past
the
and
out
in
the
passage
carmyle
turned
to
face
sally
as
king
arthur
on
a
similar
but
less
impressive
occasion
must
have
turned
to
deal
with
guinevere
so
he
said
again
sally
was
eyeing
him
steadily
considering
the
circumstances
carmyle
thought
with
not
a
little
indignation
much
too
steadily
this
he
said
ponderously
is
very
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
but
she
said
nothing
i
might
have
expected
it
said
carmyle
with
a
bitter
laugh
sally
forced
herself
from
the
lethargy
which
was
gripping
her
would
you
like
me
to
explain
she
said
there
can
be
no
explanation
said
carmyle
coldly
very
well
said
sally
there
was
a
pause
said
bruce
carmyle
said
sally
carmyle
walked
to
the
door
there
he
stopped
for
an
instant
and
glanced
back
at
her
sally
had
walked
to
the
window
and
was
looking
out
for
one
swift
instant
something
about
her
trim
little
figure
and
the
gleam
of
her
hair
where
the
sunlight
shone
on
it
seemed
to
catch
at
bruce
carmyle
heart
and
he
wavered
but
the
next
moment
he
was
strong
again
and
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
with
a
resolute
bang
out
in
the
street
climbing
into
his
car
he
looked
up
involuntarily
to
see
if
she
was
still
there
but
she
had
gone
as
the
car
gathering
speed
hummed
down
the
street
sally
was
at
the
telephone
listening
to
the
sleepy
voice
of
ginger
kemp
which
as
he
became
aware
who
it
was
that
had
woken
him
from
his
rest
and
what
she
had
to
say
to
him
magically
lost
its
sleepiness
and
took
on
a
note
of
riotous
ecstasy
five
minutes
later
ginger
was
splashing
in
his
bath
singing
discordantly
chapter
xviii
journey
end
darkness
was
beginning
to
gather
slowly
and
with
almost
an
apologetic
air
as
if
it
regretted
the
painful
duty
of
putting
an
end
to
the
perfect
summer
day
over
to
the
west
beyond
the
trees
there
still
lingered
a
faint
afterglow
and
a
new
moon
shone
like
a
silver
sickle
above
the
big
barn
sally
came
out
of
the
house
and
bowed
gravely
three
times
for
luck
she
stood
on
the
gravel
outside
the
porch
drinking
in
the
sweet
evening
scents
and
found
life
good
the
darkness
having
shown
a
certain
reluctance
at
the
start
was
now
buckling
down
to
make
a
quick
and
thorough
job
of
it
the
sky
turned
to
a
uniform
dark
blue
picked
out
with
quiet
stars
the
cement
of
the
state
road
which
led
to
patchogue
babylon
and
other
important
centres
ceased
to
be
a
pale
blur
and
became
invisible
lights
appeared
in
the
windows
of
the
houses
across
the
meadows
from
the
direction
of
the
kennels
there
came
a
single
sleepy
bark
and
the
small
white
woolly
dog
which
had
scampered
out
at
sally
heels
stopped
short
and
uttered
a
challenging
squeak
the
evening
was
so
still
that
ginger
footsteps
as
he
pounded
along
the
road
on
his
way
back
from
the
village
whither
he
had
gone
to
buy
provisions
evening
papers
and
wool
for
the
sweater
which
sally
was
knitting
were
audible
long
before
he
turned
in
at
the
gate
sally
could
not
see
him
but
she
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
once
again
felt
that
pleasant
cosy
thrill
of
happiness
which
had
come
to
her
every
evening
for
the
last
year
ginger
she
called
what
ho
the
woolly
dog
with
another
important
squeak
scuttled
down
the
drive
to
look
into
the
matter
and
was
coldly
greeted
ginger
for
all
his
love
of
dogs
had
never
been
able
to
bring
himself
to
regard
toto
with
affection
he
had
protested
when
sally
a
month
before
finding
meecher
distraught
on
account
of
a
dreadful
lethargy
which
had
seized
her
pet
had
begged
him
to
offer
hospitality
and
country
air
to
the
invalid
it
wonderful
what
you
done
for
toto
angel
said
sally
as
he
came
up
frigidly
eluding
that
curious
animal
leaps
of
welcome
he
a
different
bit
of
luck
for
him
said
ginger
in
all
the
years
i
was
at
meecher
i
never
knew
him
move
at
anything
more
rapid
than
a
stately
walk
now
he
runs
about
all
the
the
blighter
had
been
overeating
from
birth
said
ginger
that
was
all
that
was
wrong
with
him
a
little
judicious
dieting
put
him
right
we
be
able
said
ginger
brightening
to
ship
him
back
next
i
shall
quite
miss
i
nearly
missed
him
this
morning
with
a
shoe
said
ginger
he
was
up
on
the
kitchen
table
wolfing
the
bacon
and
i
took
my
murmured
sally
i
always
said
you
had
a
frightfully
brutal
streak
in
you
ginger
what
an
evening
good
lord
said
ginger
suddenly
as
they
walked
into
the
light
of
the
open
kitchen
door
now
what
he
stopped
and
eyed
her
intently
do
you
know
you
looking
prettier
than
you
were
when
i
started
down
to
the
village
sally
gave
his
arm
a
little
hug
beloved
she
said
did
you
get
the
chops
ginger
froze
in
his
tracks
horrified
oh
my
aunt
i
clean
forgot
them
oh
ginger
you
are
an
old
chump
well
you
have
to
go
in
for
a
little
judicious
dieting
like
i
say
i
most
awfully
sorry
i
got
the
if
you
think
i
going
to
eat
wool
is
there
anything
in
the
house
vegetables
and
fine
but
of
course
if
you
want
chops
not
at
all
i
spiritual
besides
people
say
that
vegetables
are
good
for
the
or
something
of
course
you
forgot
to
get
the
mail
too
absolutely
not
i
was
on
to
it
like
a
knife
two
letters
from
fellows
wanting
airedale
no
ginger
we
are
getting
on
pretty
bloated
agreed
ginger
complacently
pretty
bloated
we
be
able
to
get
that
if
things
go
buzzing
on
like
this
there
was
a
letter
for
you
here
it
it
from
fillmore
said
sally
examining
the
envelope
as
they
went
into
the
kitchen
and
about
time
too
i
have
had
a
word
from
him
for
she
sat
down
and
opened
the
letter
ginger
heaving
himself
on
to
the
table
wriggled
into
a
position
of
comfort
and
started
to
read
his
evening
paper
but
after
he
had
skimmed
over
the
sporting
page
he
lowered
it
and
allowed
his
gaze
to
rest
on
sally
bent
head
with
a
feeling
of
utter
contentment
although
a
married
man
of
nearly
a
year
standing
ginger
was
still
moving
about
a
magic
world
in
a
state
of
dazed
incredulity
unable
fully
to
realize
that
such
bliss
could
be
ginger
in
his
time
had
seen
many
things
that
looked
good
from
a
distance
but
not
one
that
had
borne
the
test
of
a
closer
acquaintance
except
this
business
of
marriage
marriage
with
sally
for
a
partner
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
very
few
things
in
the
world
in
which
there
was
no
catch
his
honest
eyes
glowed
as
he
watched
her
sally
broke
into
a
little
splutter
of
laughter
ginger
look
at
this
he
reached
down
and
took
the
slip
of
paper
which
she
held
out
to
him
the
following
legend
met
his
eye
printed
in
bold
letters
outstanding
succulent
appetizing
nutritious
just
say
pop
a
child
can
do
it
ginger
regarded
this
cipher
with
a
puzzled
frown
what
is
it
he
asked
it
how
do
you
mean
sally
gurgled
fillmore
and
gladys
have
started
a
little
restaurant
in
a
restaurant
there
was
a
shocked
note
in
ginger
voice
although
he
knew
that
the
managerial
career
of
that
modern
napoleon
his
had
terminated
in
something
of
a
smash
he
had
never
quite
lost
his
reverence
for
one
whom
he
considered
a
bit
of
a
that
fillmore
nicholas
the
man
of
destiny
should
have
descended
to
conducting
a
restaurant
and
a
little
restaurant
at
that
struck
him
as
almost
indecent
sally
on
the
other
hand
for
sisters
always
seem
to
fail
in
proper
reverence
for
the
greatness
of
their
brothers
was
delighted
it
the
most
splendid
idea
she
said
with
enthusiasm
it
really
does
look
as
if
fillmore
was
going
to
amount
to
something
at
last
apparently
they
started
on
quite
a
small
scale
just
making
why
popp
interrupted
ginger
ventilating
a
question
which
was
perplexing
him
deeply
just
a
trade
name
silly
gladys
is
a
wonderful
cook
you
know
and
she
made
the
pies
and
fillmore
toddled
round
selling
them
and
they
did
so
well
that
now
they
started
a
regular
restaurant
and
that
a
success
too
listen
to
sally
gurgled
again
and
turned
over
the
letter
where
is
it
oh
yes
sound
financial
footing
in
fact
our
success
has
been
so
instantaneous
that
i
have
decided
to
launch
out
on
a
really
big
scale
it
is
big
ideas
that
lead
to
big
business
i
am
contemplating
a
vast
extension
of
this
venture
of
ours
and
in
a
very
short
time
i
shall
organize
branches
in
new
york
chicago
detroit
and
all
the
big
cities
each
in
charge
of
a
manager
and
each
offering
as
a
special
feature
in
addition
to
the
usual
restaurant
cuisine
these
popp
outstanding
of
ours
that
done
and
having
established
all
these
branches
as
going
concerns
i
shall
sail
for
england
and
introduce
popp
there
is
he
a
little
wonder
dashed
brainy
chap
always
said
i
must
say
i
was
rather
uneasy
when
i
read
that
i
seen
so
many
of
fillmore
