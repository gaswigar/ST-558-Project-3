chapter
edward
colburne
becomes
acquainted
with
miss
lillie
ravenel
it
was
shortly
after
the
capitulation
of
loyal
fort
sumter
to
rebellious
south
carolina
that
edward
colburne
of
new
boston
made
the
acquaintance
of
miss
lillie
ravenel
of
new
orleans
an
obscure
american
author
remarks
in
one
of
his
rejected
articles
which
he
had
the
kindness
to
read
to
me
from
the
manuscript
that
every
great
historical
event
reverberates
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
through
the
fortunes
of
a
multitude
of
private
and
even
secluded
individuals
no
volcanic
eruption
rends
a
mountain
without
stirring
the
existence
of
the
mountain
mice
it
was
unquestionably
the
southern
rebellion
which
brought
miss
ravenel
and
colburne
into
interesting
juxtaposition
but
for
this
gigantic
political
upturning
it
is
probable
that
the
young
lady
would
never
have
visited
new
boston
where
the
young
gentleman
then
lived
or
visiting
it
and
meeting
him
there
would
have
been
a
person
of
no
necessary
importance
in
his
eyes
but
how
could
a
most
loyal
youth
fail
to
be
interested
in
a
pretty
and
intelligent
girl
who
was
exiled
from
her
home
because
her
father
would
not
be
a
rebel
new
boston
by
the
way
is
the
capital
city
of
the
little
yankee
state
of
barataria
i
ask
pardon
for
this
geographical
impertinence
of
introducing
a
seventh
state
into
new
england
and
solemnly
affirm
that
i
do
not
mean
to
disturb
thereby
the
congressional
balance
of
the
republic
i
make
the
arrangement
with
no
political
object
but
solely
for
my
private
convenience
so
that
i
may
tell
my
story
freely
without
being
accused
of
misrepresenting
this
private
individual
or
insulting
that
public
functionary
or
burlesquing
any
community
like
sancho
panza
famous
island
of
the
same
name
barataria
was
surrounded
by
land
at
least
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
most
islands
it
was
through
ravenel
the
father
that
colburne
made
the
acquaintance
of
miss
ravenel
in
those
days
not
yet
a
soldier
but
only
a
martially
disposed
young
lawyer
and
wrathful
patriot
he
used
to
visit
the
new
boston
house
nearly
every
evening
running
over
all
the
journals
in
the
devouring
the
telegraphic
reports
that
were
brought
up
hot
from
the
newspaper
offices
and
discussing
the
great
political
events
of
the
time
with
the
heroes
and
sages
of
the
city
one
evening
he
found
nobody
in
the
but
a
stranger
a
tall
gentleman
of
about
fifty
with
a
baldish
head
and
a
slight
stoop
in
the
shoulders
attired
in
an
english
of
modest
he
was
reading
the
new
york
evening
post
through
a
rather
dandified
eyeglass
presently
he
put
the
eyeglass
in
his
vest
pocket
produced
a
pair
of
spectacles
slipped
them
on
his
nose
and
resumed
his
reading
with
an
air
of
increased
facility
and
satisfaction
he
was
thus
engaged
and
colburne
was
waiting
for
the
post
raging
meanwhile
over
that
copperhead
sheet
the
new
boston
index
when
there
was
a
pleasant
rustle
of
female
attire
in
the
hall
which
led
by
the
papa
put
on
your
eyeglass
said
a
silver
voice
which
colburne
liked
do
take
off
those
horrid
spectacles
they
make
you
look
as
old
as
ararat
my
dear
the
eyeglass
makes
me
feel
as
old
as
you
say
responded
papa
well
stop
reading
then
and
come
up
stairs
was
the
young
next
command
i
had
such
an
awful
afternoon
with
those
pokey
people
i
want
to
tell
you
here
she
caught
sight
of
colburne
regarding
her
fixedly
in
the
mirror
and
with
another
rustle
of
vesture
she
suddenly
slid
beyond
reach
of
the
angle
of
incidence
and
refraction
the
stranger
laid
down
the
post
in
his
lap
pocketed
his
spectacles
and
looking
about
him
caught
sight
of
colburne
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
he
with
a
frank
friendly
man
of
the
world
sort
of
smile
i
have
kept
the
evening
paper
a
long
time
will
you
have
it
to
our
young
gentleman
the
civility
of
this
personage
was
somewhat
imposing
and
consequently
he
made
his
best
bow
and
would
not
accept
of
the
post
until
positively
assured
that
the
other
had
entirely
done
with
it
moreover
he
would
not
commence
reading
immediately
because
that
might
seem
like
a
tacit
reproach
so
he
uttered
a
few
patriotic
on
the
news
of
the
day
and
thereby
gave
occasion
for
this
history
yes
a
sad
struggle
a
sad
struggle
especially
for
the
south
assented
the
unnamed
gentleman
you
ca
imagine
how
unprepared
they
are
for
it
the
south
is
just
like
the
town
poor
rebelling
against
the
authorities
the
more
successful
they
are
the
more
sure
to
be
ruined
while
he
spoke
he
looked
in
the
young
and
strange
face
of
his
hearer
with
as
much
seeming
earnestness
as
if
the
latter
had
been
an
old
acquaintance
whose
opinions
were
of
value
to
him
there
was
an
amiable
fascination
in
the
sympathetic
grey
eyes
and
the
persuasive
smile
he
caught
colburne
expression
of
interest
and
proceeded
nobody
can
tell
me
anything
about
those
unlucky
misguided
people
i
am
one
of
them
by
birth
i
have
lived
among
them
nearly
all
my
life
i
know
them
they
are
as
as
hottentots
they
have
no
more
idea
of
their
relative
strength
as
compared
to
that
of
the
united
states
than
the
of
the
rocky
mountains
they
are
doomed
to
perish
by
their
own
ignorance
and
madness
it
will
probably
be
a
short
struggle
said
colburne
speaking
the
common
belief
of
the
north
i
do
know
i
do
know
about
that
we
must
be
too
sure
of
that
you
must
understand
that
they
are
barbarians
and
that
all
barbarians
are
obstinate
and
reckless
they
will
hold
out
like
the
florida
seminoles
they
will
resist
like
jackasses
and
heroes
they
wo
know
any
better
they
will
be
an
honor
to
the
fortitude
and
a
sarcasm
on
the
intelligence
of
human
nature
they
will
become
an
example
in
history
of
much
that
is
great
and
all
that
is
foolish
may
i
ask
what
part
of
the
south
you
have
resided
in
inquired
colburne
i
am
a
south
carolinian
born
but
i
have
lived
in
new
orleans
for
the
last
twenty
years
summers
excepted
a
man
ca
well
live
there
the
year
round
he
must
be
away
occasionally
to
clear
his
system
of
its
malaria
physical
and
moral
it
is
a
sodom
i
consider
it
a
proof
of
depravity
in
any
one
to
want
to
go
there
but
there
was
my
work
and
there
i
staid
as
little
as
possible
i
staid
till
this
stupid
barbarous
ashantee
rebellion
drove
me
out
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
an
exile
for
some
time
sir
observed
colburne
after
a
short
silence
during
which
he
regarded
the
exiled
stranger
with
patriotic
sympathy
i
am
afraid
so
was
the
answer
uttered
in
a
tone
which
implied
serious
reflection
if
not
sadness
he
remembers
the
lost
home
the
sacrificed
wealth
the
undeserved
hostility
the
sentence
of
outlawry
which
should
have
been
a
meed
of
honor
thought
the
enthusiastic
young
patriot
the
voice
of
welcome
ought
to
greet
him
the
hand
of
friendship
ought
to
aid
him
here
among
loyal
men
i
hope
you
stay
some
time
in
new
boston
sir
he
observed
aloud
if
i
can
be
of
the
slightest
benefit
to
you
i
shall
be
most
happy
allow
me
to
offer
you
my
card
sir
oh
thank
you
you
are
extremely
kind
said
the
stranger
he
bowed
very
politely
and
smiled
very
cordially
as
he
took
the
bit
of
pasteboard
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
slight
fixity
of
surprise
in
his
eye
which
made
the
sensitive
colburne
color
he
read
the
name
on
the
card
then
with
a
start
as
of
reminiscence
glanced
at
it
again
then
leaned
forward
and
peered
into
the
young
man
face
with
an
air
of
eager
curiosity
are
you
is
it
possible
are
you
related
to
doctor
edward
colburne
of
this
place
who
died
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
ago
i
am
his
son
sir
is
it
possible
i
am
delighted
to
meet
you
i
am
most
sincerely
and
earnestly
gratified
i
knew
your
father
well
i
had
particular
occasion
to
know
him
as
a
fellow
beginner
in
mineralogy
at
a
time
when
the
science
was
little
studied
in
this
country
we
corresponded
and
exchanged
specimens
my
name
is
ravenel
i
have
been
for
twenty
years
professor
of
theory
and
practice
in
the
medical
college
of
new
orleans
an
excellent
place
for
a
dissecting
class
by
the
way
so
many
negroes
are
whipped
to
death
so
many
white
gentlemen
die
in
their
boots
as
the
saying
is
that
we
rarely
lack
for
but
you
must
have
been
quite
young
when
you
had
the
misfortune
and
science
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
your
father
really
you
have
quite
his
look
about
the
eyes
and
forehead
what
profession
may
i
ask
law
said
colburne
who
was
flushed
with
pleasure
over
the
acquisition
of
this
charming
acquaintance
so
evidently
to
him
a
man
of
the
world
a
savant
a
philosopher
and
a
patriotic
martyr
law
that
is
a
smattering
of
it
just
enough
to
have
an
office
and
do
notary
work
a
good
profession
a
grand
profession
but
i
should
have
expected
your
father
son
to
be
a
physician
or
a
mineralogist
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
surveyed
colburne
frank
handsome
face
with
evidently
sincere
interest
he
seemed
as
much
occupied
with
this
young
stranger
history
and
prospects
as
he
had
been
a
moment
before
with
his
own
beliefs
and
exile
at
this
stage
of
the
conversation
one
of
the
hotel
servants
entered
the
room
and
said
sir
the
young
lady
wishes
you
would
come
up
stairs
if
you
please
sir
oh
certainly
answered
the
stranger
or
as
i
may
now
call
him
the
doctor
colburne
come
up
to
my
room
if
you
are
at
leisure
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
have
a
longer
conversation
with
you
colburne
was
in
the
usual
quandary
of
young
and
modest
men
on
such
occasions
he
wished
to
accept
the
invitation
he
feared
that
he
ought
not
to
take
advantage
of
it
he
did
not
know
how
to
decline
it
after
a
consideration
of
the
and
after
a
stealthy
glance
at
his
toilet
in
the
mirror
he
showed
the
good
sense
and
had
the
good
luck
to
follow
doctor
ravenel
to
his
private
parlor
as
they
entered
the
same
silver
voice
which
colburne
had
heard
below
exclaimed
why
papa
what
has
kept
you
so
long
i
have
been
as
lonely
as
a
mouse
in
a
trap
lillie
let
me
introduce
colburne
to
you
answered
papa
my
dear
sir
take
this
arm
chair
it
is
much
more
comfortable
than
those
awkward
mahogany
uprights
do
suppose
that
i
want
it
i
prefer
the
sofa
i
really
do
miss
ravenel
i
suppose
i
ought
to
state
in
this
exact
place
was
very
fair
with
lively
blue
eyes
and
exceedingly
handsome
hair
very
luxuriant
very
wavy
and
of
a
flossy
blonde
color
lighted
up
by
flashes
of
amber
she
was
tall
and
rather
slender
with
a
fine
form
and
an
uncommon
grace
of
manner
and
movement
colburne
was
flattered
by
the
quick
blush
and
pretty
momentary
flutter
of
embarrassment
with
which
she
received
him
this
same
irrepressible
blush
and
flutter
often
interested
those
male
individuals
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
make
miss
acquaintance
each
young
fellow
thought
that
she
was
specially
interested
in
himself
that
the
depths
of
her
womanly
nature
were
stirred
into
pleasurable
excitement
by
his
advent
and
it
was
frequently
not
altogether
a
mistake
miss
ravenel
was
interested
in
people
in
a
considerable
number
of
people
and
often
at
first
sight
she
had
her
father
sympathetic
character
as
well
as
his
graceful
cordiality
and
consequent
charm
of
manner
the
whole
made
more
fascinating
by
being
veiled
in
a
delicate
gauze
of
womanly
dignity
as
to
her
being
as
lovely
as
a
houri
i
confess
that
there
were
different
opinions
on
that
question
and
i
do
not
care
to
settle
it
as
i
of
course
might
by
a
tyrannical
affirmation
it
is
curious
how
resolutely
most
persons
demand
that
the
heroine
of
a
story
shall
be
extraordinarily
handsome
and
yet
the
heroine
of
many
a
love
affair
in
our
own
lives
is
not
handsome
and
most
of
us
fall
in
love
quite
earnestly
and
permanently
in
love
too
with
rather
plain
women
why
then
should
i
strain
my
conscience
by
asserting
broadly
and
positively
that
miss
ravenel
was
a
first
class
beauty
but
i
do
affirm
without
hesitation
that
like
her
father
she
was
socially
charming
i
go
farther
she
was
also
very
loveable
and
i
beg
her
pardon
very
capable
of
loving
although
up
to
this
time
she
did
not
feel
sure
that
she
possessed
either
of
these
two
qualities
she
had
simply
bowed
with
a
welcoming
smile
and
that
flattering
blush
but
without
speaking
or
offering
her
hand
when
colburne
was
presented
i
suspect
that
she
waited
for
her
father
to
give
her
a
key
to
the
nature
of
the
interview
and
an
intimation
as
to
whether
she
should
join
in
the
conversation
she
was
quite
capable
of
such
small
forethought
and
doctor
ravenel
was
worthy
of
the
trust
colburne
is
the
son
of
doctor
colburne
my
dear
he
observed
as
soon
as
his
guest
was
seated
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
the
premature
and
lamented
death
i
think
myself
very
fortunate
in
meeting
his
son
you
are
very
kind
to
call
on
us
colburne
said
the
silver
voice
with
a
musical
accent
which
almost
amounted
to
a
singsong
i
hope
you
do
hate
southerners
she
added
with
a
smile
which
made
colburne
feel
for
a
moment
as
if
he
could
not
heartily
hate
beauregard
then
the
representative
man
of
the
rebellion
we
are
from
louisiana
you
know
i
regret
to
hear
it
answered
colburne
oh
do
pity
us
she
laughed
it
is
not
such
a
bad
place
please
do
misunderstand
me
i
meant
that
i
regret
your
exile
from
your
home
thank
you
for
that
i
do
know
whether
papa
will
thank
you
or
not
he
does
appreciate
louisiana
i
do
believe
he
is
conscious
that
he
has
suffered
a
misfortune
in
being
obliged
to
quit
it
i
am
new
boston
is
very
pretty
and
the
people
are
very
nice
but
you
know
how
it
is
it
is
bad
to
lose
one
home
my
dear
i
ca
help
laughing
at
your
grand
misfortune
said
the
doctor
we
are
something
like
the
hebrews
when
they
lost
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
or
like
people
who
lose
a
sinking
wreck
by
getting
on
a
sound
vessel
besides
our
happy
home
turned
us
out
of
doors
the
doctor
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
abuse
his
own
especially
after
it
had
him
were
you
absolutely
exiled
sir
asked
colburne
i
had
to
take
sides
those
unhappy
chinese
allow
no
neutrals
nothing
but
themselves
the
central
flowery
people
and
outside
barbarians
they
have
fed
on
the
poor
blacks
until
they
ca
abide
a
man
who
is
a
cannibal
he
is
a
reproach
to
them
and
they
must
make
away
with
him
they
remind
me
of
a
cracker
whom
i
met
at
a
cross
road
tavern
in
one
of
my
journeys
through
the
north
of
georgia
this
man
a
giant
invited
me
to
drink
with
him
and
when
i
declined
got
furious
and
wanted
to
fight
me
i
told
him
that
i
never
drank
whiskey
and
that
it
made
me
sick
and
finally
succeeded
in
pacifying
him
without
touching
his
poison
in
fact
he
made
me
a
kind
of
apology
for
having
offered
to
cut
my
throat
fact
is
stranger
said
he
laying
an
accent
as
strong
as
his
liquor
on
the
personal
pronoun
use
whiskey
you
understand
the
inference
i
suppose
a
man
who
refused
whiskey
was
a
contradiction
a
reproach
to
his
personality
such
a
man
he
could
not
suffer
to
live
it
was
the
brooks
and
sumner
affair
over
again
brooks
says
is
believe
in
slavery
and
immediately
hits
sumner
over
the
head
for
not
believing
in
it
something
like
my
grandfather
who
when
he
had
to
diet
used
to
want
the
whole
family
to
live
on
dry
toast
observed
colburne
for
the
time
being
he
believed
in
the
universal
propriety
and
necessity
of
toast
were
you
in
danger
of
violence
before
you
left
new
orleans
he
presently
asked
i
beg
pardon
if
i
am
too
curious
violence
why
not
precisely
not
immediate
violence
the
point
was
this
i
must
explain
that
i
dabble
in
chemistry
as
well
as
mineralogy
now
in
all
that
city
of
raw
materialism
of
and
instinct
i
ca
call
it
intelligence
there
was
not
a
man
of
southern
principles
who
knew
enough
of
chemistry
to
make
a
fuse
they
wanted
to
possess
themselves
of
the
united
states
forts
in
their
state
they
supposed
that
they
would
be
obliged
to
shell
them
the
shells
they
had
plundered
from
the
united
states
arsenal
but
the
fuses
were
wanting
a
military
committee
requested
me
to
fabricate
them
of
course
i
was
driven
to
make
an
immediate
choice
between
rebellion
and
loyalty
i
took
the
first
steamboat
to
new
york
getting
off
just
in
time
to
escape
the
system
of
surveillance
which
the
vigilance
committees
established
it
may
seem
odd
to
some
sensible
people
that
this
learned
gentleman
of
over
fifty
should
expose
his
own
history
so
freely
to
a
young
fellow
whom
he
had
not
seen
until
half
an
hour
before
but
it
was
a
part
of
the
doctor
character
to
suppose
that
humanity
took
an
interest
in
him
just
as
he
took
an
interest
in
all
humanity
and
his
natural
frankness
had
been
increased
by
contact
with
the
prevailing
communicativeness
of
his
of
the
south
i
dare
say
that
he
would
have
unfolded
the
tale
of
his
exile
to
an
intelligent
by
whom
he
might
have
chanced
to
sit
with
as
little
hesitation
as
he
poured
it
into
the
ears
of
this
graduate
of
a
distinguished
university
and
representative
of
a
staid
puritanical
aristocracy
he
had
no
thought
of
claiming
admiration
for
his
loyalty
his
story
was
worth
telling
not
because
it
was
connected
with
his
interests
but
because
it
had
to
do
with
his
sentiments
and
convictions
why
should
he
not
relate
it
to
a
stranger
who
was
evidently
capable
of
sympathising
with
those
sentiments
and
appreciating
those
convictions
but
there
was
another
reason
for
the
doctor
frankness
at
that
time
every
circumstance
of
the
opening
civil
war
every
item
of
life
that
came
from
hostile
south
to
indignant
north
was
regarded
by
all
as
a
species
of
public
property
if
you
put
down
your
name
on
a
hotel
register
as
arrived
from
charleston
savannah
mobile
new
orleans
or
any
other
point
south
of
mason
dixon
line
you
were
immediately
addressed
and
catechised
people
wanted
to
know
how
you
escaped
and
why
you
tried
to
escape
and
were
ready
to
accord
you
any
credit
you
demanded
for
perilous
adventures
and
patriotic
motives
and
did
not
perceive
it
nor
think
a
bit
ill
of
you
if
you
showed
yourself
somewhat
of
a
romancer
and
braggart
and
you
on
the
other
hand
did
not
object
to
telling
your
story
but
let
it
out
as
naturally
as
a
man
just
rescued
from
drowning
opens
his
heart
to
the
sympathising
crowd
which
greets
him
on
the
river
bank
now
miss
ravenel
was
a
rebel
like
all
young
people
and
almost
all
women
she
was
strictly
local
narrowly
geographical
in
her
feelings
and
opinions
she
was
colored
by
the
soil
in
which
she
had
germinated
and
been
nurtured
and
during
that
year
no
flower
could
be
red
white
and
blue
in
louisiana
accordingly
the
young
lady
listened
to
the
story
of
his
exile
and
to
his
sarcasms
upon
the
people
of
her
native
city
with
certain
pretty
little
starts
and
sniffs
of
disapprobation
which
reminded
colburne
of
the
counterfeit
spittings
of
a
kitten
playing
anger
she
could
not
under
any
provocation
quarrel
with
her
father
but
she
could
perseveringly
and
energetically
disagree
with
his
opinions
when
he
had
closed
his
tirade
and
history
she
broke
forth
in
a
defence
of
her
darling
dixie
now
papa
you
are
too
bad
colburne
do
you
think
he
is
too
bad
just
see
here
louisiana
is
my
native
state
and
papa
has
lived
there
half
his
life
he
could
not
have
been
treated
more
kindly
nor
have
been
thought
more
of
than
he
was
by
those
ashantees
as
he
calls
them
until
he
took
sides
against
them
if
you
never
lived
with
the
southerners
you
do
know
how
pleasant
they
are
i
do
mean
those
rough
creatures
from
arkansas
and
texas
nor
the
stupid
acadians
nor
the
poor
white
trash
there
are
low
people
everywhere
but
i
do
say
that
the
better
classes
of
louisiana
and
mississippi
and
georgia
and
south
carolina
and
virginia
yes
and
of
tennessee
and
kentucky
are
right
nice
if
they
do
know
all
about
chemistry
and
mineralogy
they
can
talk
delightfully
to
ladies
they
are
perfectly
charming
at
receptions
and
dinner
parties
they
are
so
hospitable
too
and
generous
and
courteous
now
i
call
that
civilization
i
say
that
such
people
are
civilized
they
have
taught
you
ashantee
english
though
smiled
the
doctor
who
has
not
yet
fully
realized
the
fact
that
his
daughter
has
become
a
young
lady
and
ought
no
longer
to
be
criticised
like
a
school
girl
i
am
afraid
colburne
wo
understand
what
nice
means
oh
yes
he
will
do
try
to
understand
it
colburne
answers
miss
ravenel
coloring
to
her
temples
and
fluttering
like
a
canary
whose
cage
has
been
shaken
but
still
smiling
her
father
satire
delivered
before
a
stranger
touched
her
but
could
not
irritate
a
good
temper
softened
by
affection
i
must
be
allowed
to
use
those
ashantee
phrases
once
in
a
while
she
went
on
we
learn
them
from
our
old
mammas
that
is
you
know
our
nice
old
black
nurses
well
i
admit
that
the
mammas
are
not
grammarians
i
admit
that
louisiana
is
not
perfect
but
it
is
my
louisiana
and
papa
it
ought
to
be
your
louisiana
i
think
we
owe
fealty
to
our
state
and
should
go
with
it
wherever
it
goes
do
you
believe
in
state
rights
colburne
would
you
stand
by
barataria
in
any
and
every
case
not
against
the
union
miss
ravenel
responded
the
young
man
unshaken
in
his
loyalty
even
by
that
earnest
look
and
winning
smile
oh
dear
how
can
you
say
so
exclaims
the
lovely
advocate
of
secession
i
thought
new
englanders
all
but
massachusetts
people
would
agree
with
us
was
the
hartford
convention
held
in
new
england
i
ca
help
admiring
your
knowledge
of
political
history
but
the
hartford
convention
is
a
byeword
of
reproach
among
us
now
we
should
as
soon
think
of
being
governed
by
the
blue
laws
at
this
declaration
miss
ravenel
lost
hope
of
converting
her
auditor
she
dropped
back
in
her
corner
of
the
sofa
clasping
her
hands
and
pouting
her
lips
with
a
charming
earnestness
of
mild
desperation
well
the
evening
passed
away
delightfully
to
the
young
patriot
although
it
grieved
his
soul
to
find
miss
ravenel
such
a
traitor
to
the
republic
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
he
bade
the
strangers
good
night
and
apologized
for
staying
so
late
and
accepted
an
invitation
to
call
next
day
and
hoped
they
would
continue
to
live
in
new
boston
he
actually
trembled
with
pleasure
when
lillie
at
parting
gave
him
her
hand
in
the
frank
southern
fashion
and
after
he
had
reached
his
cosy
bedroom
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
public
square
he
had
to
smoke
a
segar
to
compose
himself
to
sleep
and
succeeded
so
ill
in
his
attempt
to
secure
speedy
slumber
that
he
heard
the
town
clock
ring
out
one
and
then
two
of
the
morning
before
he
lost
his
consciousness
oh
dear
papa
how
he
did
hang
on
said
miss
ravenel
as
soon
as
the
door
had
shut
behind
him
certainly
it
was
late
and
she
had
a
right
to
be
impatient
with
the
visitor
especially
as
he
was
a
yankee
and
an
abolitionist
but
miss
ravenel
like
most
young
ladies
was
a
bit
of
a
hypocrite
in
talking
of
young
men
and
was
not
so
very
ill
pleased
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
with
the
hanging
on
of
colburne
chapter
ii
miss
ravenel
becomes
acquainted
with
carter
colburne
was
not
tardy
in
calling
on
the
ravenels
nor
careless
in
improving
chances
of
encountering
them
by
seeming
accident
his
modesty
made
him
afraid
of
being
tiresome
and
his
sensitiveness
of
being
ridiculous
but
neither
the
one
terror
nor
the
other
prevented
him
from
inflicting
a
good
deal
of
his
society
upon
the
interesting
exiles
three
weeks
after
his
introduction
it
was
his
good
fortune
to
be
invited
to
meet
them
at
a
dinner
party
given
them
by
professor
whitewood
of
his
own
alma
mater
the
celebrated
winslow
university
the
whitewood
house
was
of
an
architecture
so
common
in
new
boston
that
in
describing
it
i
run
no
risk
of
identifying
it
to
the
curious
exteriorly
it
was
a
square
box
of
brick
stuccoed
to
represent
granite
interiorly
it
consisted
of
four
rooms
on
each
floor
divided
by
a
hall
up
and
down
the
centre
this
was
the
original
construction
to
which
had
been
added
a
greenhouse
into
which
you
passed
through
the
parlor
carefully
balanced
by
a
study
into
which
you
passed
through
the
library
trim
regular
geometrical
one
half
of
the
structure
weighing
to
an
ounce
just
as
much
as
the
other
half
and
the
whole
perhaps
forming
some
exact
fraction
of
the
entire
avoirdupois
of
the
globe
the
very
furniture
distributed
at
measured
distances
it
was
precisely
such
a
building
as
the
new
boston
soul
would
naturally
create
for
itself
miss
ravenel
noticed
this
with
a
quickness
of
perception
as
to
the
relations
of
mind
and
matter
which
astonished
and
amused
colburne
if
i
should
be
transported
on
aladdin
carpet
she
said
fast
asleep
to
some
unknown
country
and
should
wake
up
and
find
myself
in
such
a
house
as
this
i
should
know
that
i
was
in
new
boston
how
the
professor
must
enjoy
himself
here
this
room
is
exactly
twenty
feet
one
way
by
twenty
feet
the
other
then
the
hall
is
just
ten
feet
across
by
just
forty
in
length
the
professor
can
look
at
it
and
say
four
times
ten
is
forty
then
the
greenhouse
and
the
study
balance
each
other
like
the
of
a
steamer
why
will
you
all
be
so
square
but
how
shall
we
become
triangular
or
circular
or
or
cruciform
asked
colburne
and
what
would
be
the
good
of
it
if
we
should
get
into
those
forms
you
would
be
so
much
more
picturesque
i
should
enjoy
myself
so
much
more
in
looking
at
you
i
am
so
sorry
you
do
like
us
how
it
grieves
you
laughed
the
young
lady
a
flush
of
rose
mounted
her
cheek
as
she
said
this
but
i
must
beg
the
reader
to
recollect
that
miss
ravenel
blushed
at
anything
and
nothing
now
here
are
buildings
of
all
shapes
and
colors
she
proceeded
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
photographic
album
which
contained
views
of
venetian
architecture
do
you
see
that
these
were
not
built
by
new
bostonians
they
were
in
the
library
whither
miss
whitewood
had
conducted
them
to
exhibit
her
father
fine
collection
of
photographs
and
engravings
a
shy
but
hospitable
and
thoughtful
maiden
incapable
of
striking
up
a
flirtation
of
her
own
and
with
not
a
selfish
matrimonial
in
her
head
but
still
quite
able
to
sympathise
with
the
loves
of
others
miss
whitewood
had
seated
her
two
guests
at
their
art
banquet
and
then
had
gently
withdrawn
herself
from
the
study
so
that
they
might
talk
of
what
they
chose
without
restraint
it
was
already
reported
with
or
without
reason
that
colburne
was
interested
in
the
fascinating
young
exile
from
louisiana
and
that
she
was
not
so
indifferent
to
him
as
she
evidently
was
to
most
of
the
new
boston
beaux
this
was
the
reason
why
that
awkward
but
good
miss
whitewood
years
old
and
without
a
suitor
be
it
remembered
had
brought
them
into
the
quiet
of
the
study
meantime
the
door
was
wide
open
into
the
hall
and
exactly
opposite
to
it
was
another
door
wide
open
into
the
parlor
where
in
full
view
of
the
young
people
sat
all
the
old
people
meaning
thereby
doctor
ravenel
professor
whitewood
whitewood
and
her
prematurely
daughter
the
three
new
bostonians
were
listening
with
evident
delight
to
the
fluent
and
zealous
louisianian
but
instead
of
entering
upon
his
conversation
which
consisted
chiefly
of
lively
satire
and
declamation
directed
against
slavery
and
its
rebellious
partizans
let
us
revert
for
a
tiresome
moment
or
two
while
dinner
is
preparing
and
other
guests
are
arriving
to
the
subject
on
which
miss
ravenel
has
been
teasing
colburne
new
boston
is
not
a
lively
nor
a
sociable
place
the
principal
reason
for
this
is
that
it
is
inhabited
chiefly
by
new
englanders
puritanism
the
prevailing
faith
of
that
land
and
race
is
not
only
not
favorable
but
is
absolutely
noxious
to
social
gayeties
amenities
and
graces
i
say
this
in
sorrow
and
not
in
anger
for
new
england
is
the
land
of
my
birth
and
puritanism
is
the
creed
of
my
progenitors
and
i
add
as
a
mere
matter
of
justice
that
deficient
as
the
new
bostonians
are
in
timely
smiles
and
appropriate
compliments
bare
as
they
are
of
jollities
and
angular
in
manners
and
opinions
they
have
strong
sympathies
for
what
is
clearly
right
and
can
become
enthusiastic
in
a
matter
of
conscience
and
benevolence
if
they
have
not
learned
how
to
love
the
beautiful
they
know
how
to
love
the
good
and
true
but
puritanism
is
not
the
only
reason
why
the
new
bostonians
are
socially
stiff
and
unsympathetic
the
city
is
divided
into
more
than
the
ordinary
number
of
cliques
and
coteries
and
they
are
hedged
from
each
other
by
an
unusually
thorny
spirit
of
repulsion
from
times
now
far
beyond
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
the
capsheaf
in
the
social
pyramid
has
been
allotted
by
common
consent
without
much
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
other
inhabitants
to
the
president
and
professors
of
winslow
university
their
families
and
the
few
whom
they
choose
to
honor
with
their
intimacy
in
early
days
this
learned
institution
was
chiefly
theological
and
its
magnates
all
clerical
and
it
was
inevitable
that
men
bearing
the
priestly
dignity
should
hold
high
rank
in
a
puritan
community
eighty
or
a
hundred
years
ago
moreover
the
professor
with
his
salary
of
a
thousand
dollars
yearly
was
a
nabob
of
wealth
in
a
city
where
there
were
not
ten
merchants
and
not
one
retired
capitalist
who
could
boast
an
equal
income
finally
learning
is
a
title
to
consideration
which
always
has
been
and
still
is
recognized
by
the
majority
of
respectable
americans
an
objectionable
feature
of
this
sacred
inner
circle
of
society
is
that
it
contains
none
of
those
seraphim
called
young
gentlemen
the
sons
of
the
professors
excepting
the
few
who
become
tutors
and
eventually
succeed
their
fathers
leave
new
boston
for
larger
fields
of
enterprise
the
daughters
of
the
professors
enamored
of
learning
and
its
votaries
alone
will
not
dance
nor
much
less
intermarry
with
the
children
of
shippers
and
manufacturers
and
thus
it
happens
that
almost
the
only
beaux
whom
you
will
discover
at
the
parties
given
in
this
upper
five
hundred
are
slender
and
beardless
undergraduates
from
the
time
of
colburne
introduction
to
the
ravenels
it
was
the
desire
of
his
heart
to
make
new
boston
a
pleasant
place
to
them
and
by
dint
of
spreading
abroad
the
fame
of
their
patriotism
and
its
ennobling
meed
of
martyrdom
he
was
able
in
those
excitable
days
to
infect
with
the
same
fancy
all
his
relatives
and
most
of
his
acquaintances
so
that
in
a
short
time
the
exiles
received
quite
a
number
of
hospitable
calls
and
invitations
the
doctor
travelled
man
of
the
world
as
he
was
made
no
sort
of
difficulty
in
enjoying
or
seeming
to
enjoy
these
attentions
if
he
did
not
sincerely
and
heartily
relish
the
new
bostonians
so
different
in
flavor
of
manner
and
education
from
the
society
in
which
he
had
been
educated
he
at
least
made
them
one
and
all
believe
that
they
were
luxuries
to
his
palate
he
became
shortly
the
most
popular
man
for
a
dinner
party
or
an
evening
that
was
ever
known
in
that
city
of
geometry
and
puritanism
except
when
they
had
wandered
outside
of
new
boston
or
rather
i
should
say
outside
of
new
england
and
got
across
the
ocean
or
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
these
good
and
grave
burghers
had
never
beheld
such
a
radiant
smiling
universally
sympathetic
and
perennially
sociable
gentleman
of
fifty
as
ravenel
a
most
interesting
spectacle
was
it
to
see
him
meet
and
greet
one
of
the
elder
magnates
of
the
university
usually
a
solid
and
sincere
but
shy
and
somewhat
unintelligible
person
who
always
meant
three
or
four
times
as
much
as
he
said
or
looked
and
whose
ice
melted
away
from
him
leaving
him
free
to
smile
as
our
southern
friend
fervently
grasped
his
frigid
hand
and
beamed
with
tropical
warmth
into
his
arctic
spirit
such
a
greeting
was
as
exhilarating
as
a
pint
of
sherry
to
the
sad
sedentary
scholar
who
had
just
come
from
a
weary
day
grubbing
among
hebrew
roots
and
whose
afternoon
recreation
had
been
a
walk
in
the
city
cemetery
there
were
not
wanting
good
people
who
feared
the
doctor
who
were
suspicious
of
this
inexhaustible
courtesy
and
alarmed
at
these
conversational
powers
of
fascination
who
doubted
whether
poison
might
not
infect
the
pleasant
talk
as
malaria
fills
the
air
of
louisiana
i
consider
him
a
very
dangerous
man
he
might
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
if
he
chose
remarked
one
of
those
conscientious
but
uncharitable
ladies
whom
i
have
regarded
since
my
childhood
with
a
mixture
of
veneration
and
dislike
with
only
one
lung
and
an
intermittent
digestion
without
a
single
rounded
outline
or
graceful
movement
she
was
a
sad
example
of
what
the
new
england
east
winds
can
do
in
enfeebling
and
distorting
the
human
form
divine
such
are
too
many
of
the
new
boston
women
when
they
reach
that
middle
age
which
should
be
physically
an
era
of
adipose
and
morally
of
charity
even
her
smile
was
a
woful
phenomenon
it
seemed
to
be
rather
a
symptom
of
pain
than
an
expression
of
pleasure
it
was
a
kind
of
griping
smile
like
that
of
an
infant
with
the
colic
if
he
chose
what
harm
would
he
choose
to
do
expostulated
colburne
for
whose
ears
this
warning
was
intended
i
ca
precisely
make
out
whether
he
is
orthodox
or
not
replied
the
inexorable
lady
and
if
he
heterodox
what
an
awful
power
he
has
for
deceiving
and
leading
away
the
minds
of
the
young
he
is
altogether
too
agreeable
to
win
my
confidence
until
i
know
that
he
is
guided
and
restrained
by
grace
that
is
the
most
unjust
thing
that
i
ever
heard
of
broke
out
colburne
indignantly
to
condemn
a
man
because
he
is
charming
if
the
converse
of
the
rule
is
true
ruggles
if
unpleasant
people
are
to
be
admired
because
they
are
such
then
some
of
us
new
bostonians
ought
to
be
objects
of
adoration
i
have
my
opinions
colburne
retorted
the
lady
who
was
somewhat
stung
although
not
clever
enough
to
comprehend
how
badly
it
makes
a
great
difference
with
an
object
who
looks
at
it
continued
the
young
man
i
sometimes
wonder
what
the
ants
think
of
us
human
beings
do
they
understand
our
capacities
duties
and
destinies
or
do
they
look
upon
us
from
what
might
be
called
a
pismire
point
of
view
colburne
could
say
such
things
because
he
was
a
popular
favorite
to
people
who
like
the
new
bostonians
did
not
demand
a
high
finish
of
manner
this
young
man
was
charming
he
was
sympathetic
earnest
in
his
feelings
as
frank
as
such
a
modest
fellow
could
be
and
among
friends
had
any
quantity
of
expansion
and
animation
he
would
get
into
a
gale
of
jesting
and
laughter
over
a
game
of
whist
provided
his
fellow
players
were
in
anywise
disposed
to
be
merry
on
such
occasions
his
eyes
became
so
bright
and
his
cheeks
so
flushed
that
he
seemed
luminous
with
good
humor
his
laugh
was
sonorous
hearty
and
contagious
and
he
was
not
at
all
fastidious
as
to
what
he
laughed
at
it
was
sufficient
for
him
if
he
saw
that
you
meant
to
be
witty
in
conversation
he
was
very
pleasant
and
had
only
one
questionable
trick
which
was
a
truly
american
habit
of
hyperbole
when
he
was
excited
he
had
a
droll
way
of
running
his
fingers
through
his
wavy
brown
hair
until
it
stood
up
in
picturesque
masses
which
were
very
becoming
his
forehead
was
broad
and
clear
his
complexion
moderately
light
with
a
strong
color
in
the
cheeks
his
nose
straight
and
handsome
and
other
features
sufficiently
regular
his
eyes
of
a
light
hazel
and
remarkable
for
their
gentleness
there
was
nothing
hidden
nothing
stern
in
his
expression
you
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
was
the
embodiment
of
frankness
and
good
nature
in
person
he
was
strongly
built
and
he
had
increased
his
vigor
by
systematic
exercise
he
had
been
one
of
the
best
gymnasts
and
oarsmen
in
college
and
still
kept
up
his
familiarity
with
and
racing
shells
his
firm
white
arms
were
well
set
on
broad
shoulders
and
a
full
chest
and
a
pair
of
long
vigorous
legs
completed
an
uncommonly
fine
figure
pardonably
proud
of
the
strength
which
he
had
in
part
created
he
loved
to
exhibit
gymnastic
feats
and
to
talk
of
the
matches
in
which
he
had
been
it
was
the
only
subject
on
which
he
exhibited
personal
vanity
to
sum
up
he
was
considered
in
his
set
the
finest
and
most
agreeable
young
man
in
new
boston
let
us
now
return
to
the
dinner
of
professor
whitewood
the
party
consisted
of
eight
persons
the
male
places
being
filled
by
professor
whitewood
doctor
ravenel
colburne
and
a
carter
the
female
by
and
miss
whitewood
miss
ravenel
and
john
whitewood
jr
this
last
named
individual
the
son
and
heir
of
the
host
a
youth
of
twenty
years
of
age
was
a
very
proper
person
to
fill
the
position
of
fourth
lady
thin
pale
and
almost
sallow
with
pinched
features
surmounted
by
a
high
and
roomy
forehead
tall
slender
and
fragile
in
form
shy
silent
and
pure
as
the
timidest
of
girls
he
was
an
example
of
what
can
be
done
with
youthful
blood
muscle
mind
and
feeling
by
the
studious
severities
of
a
puritan
university
miss
ravenel
accustomed
to
far
more
masculine
men
felt
a
contempt
for
him
at
the
first
glance
saying
to
herself
how
dreadfully
ladylike
she
was
far
better
satisfied
with
the
appearance
of
the
stranger
carter
a
little
above
the
middle
height
he
was
with
a
full
chest
broad
shoulders
and
muscular
arms
brown
curling
hair
and
a
monstrous
brown
mustache
forehead
not
very
high
nose
straight
and
chin
dimpled
brown
eyes
at
once
audacious
and
mirthful
and
a
dark
rich
complexion
which
made
one
think
of
pipes
of
sherry
wine
as
well
as
of
years
of
sunburnt
adventure
when
he
was
presented
to
her
he
looked
her
full
in
the
eyes
with
a
bold
flash
of
interest
which
caused
her
to
color
from
her
forehead
to
her
shoulders
in
age
he
might
have
been
anywhere
from
to
in
manner
he
was
a
thorough
man
of
the
world
without
the
insinuating
suavity
of
her
father
but
with
all
his
and
readiness
colburne
had
not
expected
this
alarming
phenomenon
he
was
clever
enough
to
recognize
the
stranger
gigantic
social
stature
at
a
glance
and
like
the
israelitish
spies
in
the
presence
of
the
amakim
he
felt
himself
shrink
to
a
grasshopper
mediocrity
at
table
the
company
was
arranged
as
follows
at
the
head
sat
whitewood
with
ravenel
on
her
right
and
miss
whitewood
on
her
left
at
the
foot
was
the
host
flanked
on
the
right
by
miss
ravenel
and
on
the
left
by
carter
the
two
central
side
places
were
occupied
by
young
whitewood
and
colburne
the
latter
being
between
miss
whitewood
and
miss
ravenel
with
a
quickness
of
perception
which
i
suspect
he
would
not
have
shown
had
not
his
heart
been
interested
in
the
question
he
immediately
decided
that
doctor
ravenel
was
intended
to
go
with
whitewood
and
this
strange
officer
with
miss
ravenel
while
he
was
to
devote
himself
to
miss
whitewood
the
worrying
thought
drove
every
brilliant
idea
from
his
head
he
could
no
more
talk
and
be
merry
than
could
that
hermaphrodite
soul
whose
lean
body
and
cadaverous
countenance
fronted
him
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
miss
whitewood
who
was
nearly
as
great
a
student
as
her
brother
was
almost
as
deficient
in
the
powers
of
speech
she
made
an
effort
first
in
the
direction
of
the
coming
presentation
day
then
towards
notes
on
cicero
finally
upon
the
weather
at
last
with
a
sympathetic
divination
she
guessed
the
cause
of
colburne
gloom
and
sank
into
a
pitying
silence
as
for
whitewood
amiable
woman
and
excellent
housewife
though
an
invalid
her
conversational
faculty
consisted
in
listening
thus
nobody
talked
except
the
ravenels
carter
and
professor
whitewood
colburne
endeavored
to
conceal
his
troubled
condition
by
a
smile
of
counterfeit
interest
in
the
conversation
then
he
grew
ashamed
of
himself
and
tearing
off
his
fictitious
smirk
substituted
a
look
of
stern
thought
thereby
exhibiting
an
honest
countenance
but
not
one
suitable
to
the
occasion
there
was
sherry
on
the
table
not
because
was
a
habit
of
the
whitewoods
inasmuch
as
the
hostess
had
brought
it
out
of
the
family
medical
stores
with
a
painful
twinge
of
conscience
but
there
it
was
in
deference
to
the
supposed
tastes
of
the
army
gentleman
and
the
strangers
from
the
south
colburne
was
tempted
to
rouse
himself
with
a
glass
of
it
but
did
not
being
a
pledged
member
of
a
temperance
society
instead
of
this
he
made
a
gallant
moral
effort
and
succeeded
in
talking
copiously
to
the
junior
whitewood
but
as
what
he
said
is
of
little
consequence
to
our
story
let
us
go
back
a
few
moments
and
learn
what
it
was
that
had
depressed
his
spirits
i
am
delighted
to
meet
some
one
from
louisiana
miss
ravenel
said
the
after
the
master
of
the
house
had
said
grace
why
are
you
a
louisianian
asked
the
young
lady
with
a
blush
of
interest
which
was
the
first
thing
that
troubled
colburne
not
precisely
i
came
very
near
calling
myself
such
at
one
time
i
liked
the
state
and
the
people
so
much
i
was
stationed
there
for
several
years
indeed
at
new
orleans
not
so
fortunate
replied
the
lieutenant
colonel
with
a
smile
and
a
slight
bow
which
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
if
he
had
been
stationed
there
he
might
have
hoped
for
the
happiness
of
knowing
miss
ravenel
earlier
i
was
stationed
in
the
arsenal
at
baton
rouge
i
never
was
at
baton
rouge
i
mean
i
never
visited
there
i
have
passed
there
repeatedly
in
going
up
and
down
the
river
just
while
the
boat
made
its
landings
you
know
what
a
beautiful
place
it
is
i
do
mean
the
buildings
but
the
situation
the
bluffs
precisely
great
relief
to
get
to
baton
rouge
and
see
a
hill
or
two
after
staying
in
the
lowlands
oh
do
say
anything
against
the
lowlands
begged
miss
ravenel
i
wo
promised
the
lieutenant
colonel
give
you
my
word
of
honor
i
wo
do
it
not
even
in
the
strictest
privacy
there
was
a
cavalier
dash
in
the
gentleman
tone
and
manner
he
looked
and
spoke
as
if
he
felt
himself
quite
good
enough
for
his
company
and
so
he
was
at
least
in
respect
to
descent
and
social
position
for
no
family
in
virginia
boasted
a
purer
strain
of
old
colonial
blue
blood
than
the
carters
in
addition
the
lieutenant
colonel
was
a
gentleman
by
right
of
a
graduation
from
west
point
and
of
a
commission
in
the
regular
service
which
dated
back
to
the
times
when
there
were
no
volunteers
and
few
civilian
appointments
and
when
by
consequence
army
officers
formed
a
caste
of
aristocratic
military
brahmins
from
the
regular
service
however
in
which
he
had
been
only
a
lieutenant
his
name
had
vanished
several
years
previous
his
was
a
volunteer
commission
issued
by
the
governor
of
the
state
it
was
in
the
second
barataria
a
regiment
which
was
shortly
to
distinguish
itself
by
a
masterly
retreat
from
bull
run
carter
had
injured
his
ancle
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
and
was
away
from
the
army
on
a
sick
leave
of
twenty
days
avoiding
the
hospitals
of
washington
and
giving
up
his
customary
enjoyments
in
new
york
for
the
sake
of
attending
to
business
which
will
transpire
during
this
narrative
his
leave
had
nearly
expired
but
he
had
applied
to
the
war
department
for
an
extension
of
ten
days
and
was
awaiting
an
answer
from
that
awful
headquarters
with
the
utmost
tranquillity
if
he
found
himself
in
the
condition
of
being
absent
without
leave
he
knew
how
to
explain
things
to
a
military
commission
or
a
board
of
inquiry
the
liked
the
appearance
of
the
young
person
whom
he
had
been
invited
to
meet
in
the
first
place
he
said
to
himself
she
had
a
charming
mixture
of
girlish
freshness
and
of
the
society
air
which
he
considered
indispensable
to
a
lady
in
the
second
place
she
looked
somewhat
like
his
late
wife
and
although
he
had
been
a
wasteful
and
neglectful
husband
he
still
kept
a
moderately
soft
spot
in
his
heart
for
the
memory
of
the
departed
one
not
being
in
this
respect
different
i
understand
from
the
majority
of
widowers
he
saw
that
miss
ravenel
was
willing
to
talk
any
kind
of
nothing
so
long
as
she
could
talk
of
her
native
state
and
that
therefore
he
could
please
her
without
much
intellectual
strain
or
chance
of
rivalry
consequently
he
prattled
and
made
prattle
for
some
minutes
about
louisiana
were
you
acquainted
with
the
mcallisters
he
wanted
to
know
very
natural
that
you
should
be
they
lived
up
the
river
and
seldom
went
to
the
city
they
had
such
a
noble
plantation
though
you
could
enjoy
the
true
princely
louisiana
hospitality
there
splendid
life
that
of
a
southern
planter
if
i
had
been
in
the
army
or
rather
if
i
could
have
done
everything
that
i
fancied
i
should
have
become
a
sugar
planter
of
course
i
should
have
run
myself
out
for
it
takes
a
frightful
capital
and
some
business
faculty
or
else
the
best
of
luck
by
the
way
i
am
afraid
those
fine
fellows
will
all
of
them
come
to
grief
if
this
war
continues
five
or
six
years
five
or
six
years
exclaimed
professor
whitewood
in
astonishment
but
not
in
dismay
so
utter
was
his
incredulity
do
you
suppose
colonel
that
the
rebels
can
resist
for
five
or
six
years
why
not
ten
or
twelve
millions
of
people
on
their
own
ground
and
difficult
ground
too
will
make
a
terrific
resistance
they
are
as
well
prepared
as
we
are
and
better
frederic
of
prussia
was
conquered
in
seven
years
i
do
see
anything
unreasonable
in
allowing
these
fellows
five
or
six
by
the
way
he
laughed
i
am
giving
you
an
honest
professional
opinion
talking
outside
to
the
rabble
talking
as
a
patriot
here
he
laughed
again
and
not
as
an
officer
i
say
three
months
do
it
in
three
months
gentlemen
he
added
setting
his
head
back
and
swelling
his
chest
in
imitation
of
the
conventional
popular
orator
miss
ravenel
laughed
outright
to
hear
the
enemies
of
her
section
satirized
but
how
will
the
south
stand
a
contest
of
five
or
six
years
queried
the
professor
oh
badly
of
course
get
whipped
of
course
that
is
if
we
develope
energy
and
military
talent
we
have
the
resources
to
thrash
them
war
in
the
long
run
is
pretty
much
a
matter
of
arithmetical
calculation
oh
miss
ravenel
i
was
about
to
ask
you
did
you
know
the
slidells
very
slightly
why
slightly
did
you
like
them
i
thought
they
were
very
agreeable
people
though
to
be
sure
they
were
they
were
very
ultra
you
know
and
papa
was
of
the
other
party
oh
indeed
said
the
turning
his
head
and
surveying
ravenel
with
curiosity
not
because
he
was
loyal
but
because
he
was
the
young
lady
papa
how
i
regret
that
i
had
no
chance
to
make
your
father
acquaintance
in
louisiana
give
you
my
honor
that
i
so
simple
as
to
prefer
baton
rouge
to
new
orleans
i
tried
to
get
ordered
to
the
crescent
city
but
the
war
department
was
obdurate
i
am
confident
he
added
with
his
audacious
smile
half
flattering
and
half
quizzical
that
if
the
washington
people
had
known
that
i
lost
by
not
getting
to
new
orleans
they
would
have
relented
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
miss
ravenel
that
he
meant
to
pay
her
a
compliment
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
probably
in
short
dresses
when
the
gallant
was
on
duty
at
baton
rouge
and
thus
missed
a
chance
of
seeing
her
in
new
orleans
but
she
did
not
allude
to
this
ludicrous
possibility
she
only
colored
at
his
audacity
and
said
oh
it
such
a
lovely
city
i
think
it
is
far
preferable
to
new
york
but
is
it
not
a
very
wicked
city
asked
the
host
quite
seriously
whitewood
how
can
you
say
that
to
me
a
native
of
it
she
laughed
jerusalem
pursued
the
professor
getting
out
of
his
scrape
with
a
kind
of
ponderous
dexterity
like
an
elephant
backing
off
a
shaky
bridge
and
taking
his
time
about
it
like
noah
spending
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
in
building
his
ark
jerusalem
proved
her
wickedness
by
casting
out
the
prophets
it
seems
to
me
that
your
presence
here
and
that
of
your
father
as
exiles
is
sufficient
proof
of
the
iniquity
of
new
orleans
upon
my
honor
professor
burst
out
the
you
beat
the
best
man
i
ever
saw
at
a
compliment
it
was
now
professor
whitewood
pale
and
wrinkled
cheek
which
flushed
partly
with
gratification
partly
with
embarrassment
his
wife
surveyed
him
in
mild
astonishment
almost
fearing
that
he
had
indulged
in
much
sherry
the
by
the
way
had
taken
to
the
wine
in
a
style
which
showed
that
he
was
used
to
the
taste
of
it
and
liked
the
effects
his
conversation
grew
more
animated
his
bass
voice
rang
from
end
to
end
of
the
table
startling
whitewood
his
fine
brown
eyes
flashed
and
a
few
drops
of
perspiration
beaded
his
brow
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
sherry
alone
could
do
as
much
as
this
for
so
old
a
campaigner
that
afternoon
as
he
lounged
and
yawned
in
the
of
the
new
boston
house
he
had
thought
of
professor
whitewood
invitation
and
feeling
and
stupid
had
concluded
not
to
go
to
the
dinner
although
in
the
morning
he
had
sent
a
note
of
acceptance
then
feeling
and
stupid
as
i
said
he
took
a
glass
of
ale
and
subsequently
a
stiffish
following
up
the
treatment
with
a
segar
which
by
producing
a
dryness
of
the
throat
induced
him
to
try
another
fortified
by
cents
worth
of
liquor
at
the
then
prices
he
felt
his
ambition
and
industry
revive
by
jove
carter
he
said
to
himself
you
must
go
to
that
whitewood
is
just
one
of
those
pious
heavyweights
who
can
bring
this
puritanical
governor
to
terms
put
on
your
best
toggery
carter
and
make
your
bow
and
say
thus
it
was
that
when
the
professor
sherry
entered
into
the
it
found
an
ally
there
which
aided
it
to
produce
the
signs
of
excitement
colburne
i
grieve
to
say
almost
rejoiced
in
detecting
these
symptoms
thinking
that
surely
miss
ravenel
would
not
fancy
a
man
who
was
to
say
the
least
inordinately
convivial
alas
miss
ravenel
had
been
too
much
accustomed
to
just
such
gentlemen
in
new
orleans
society
to
see
anything
disgusting
or
even
surprising
in
the
manner
of
the
she
continued
to
prattle
with
him
in
her
pleasantest
manner
about
louisiana
not
in
the
least
restrained
by
colburne
presence
and
only
now
and
then
casting
an
anxious
glance
at
her
father
for
ravenel
the
father
man
of
the
world
as
he
was
did
not
fancy
the
bacchanalian
new
orleans
type
of
gentility
having
observed
that
it
frequently
brought
itself
and
its
wife
and
children
to
grief
the
dinner
lasted
an
hour
and
a
half
by
which
time
it
was
nearly
twilight
the
ordinary
prandial
hour
of
the
whitewoods
as
well
as
of
most
fashionable
new
boston
people
was
not
later
than
two
in
the
afternoon
but
this
had
been
considered
a
special
occasion
on
account
of
the
origin
of
some
of
the
guests
and
the
meal
had
therefore
commenced
at
five
on
leaving
the
table
the
party
went
into
the
parlor
and
had
coffee
then
miss
ravenel
thought
it
wise
to
propitiate
her
father
searching
eye
by
quitting
the
with
his
pleasant
worldly
ways
and
his
fascinating
masculine
maturity
and
going
to
visit
the
greenhouse
in
company
with
that
pale
bit
of
human
celery
john
whitewood
carter
politely
stood
up
to
the
rack
for
a
while
with
miss
whitewood
but
finding
it
dry
fodder
to
his
taste
soon
made
his
adieux
colburne
shortly
followed
in
a
state
of
mind
to
question
the
goodness
of
providence
in
permitting
chapter
iii
colburne
takes
a
segar
with
carter
as
colburne
neared
his
house
he
saw
the
standing
in
the
flare
of
a
street
lamp
and
looking
up
at
the
luminary
with
an
air
of
puzzled
consideration
with
a
temperance
man
usual
lack
of
charity
to
people
given
to
wine
the
civilian
judged
that
the
soldier
was
disgracefully
intoxicated
and
instead
of
thinking
how
to
conduct
him
quietly
home
was
about
to
pass
him
by
on
the
other
side
the
turned
and
recognized
the
young
man
in
other
states
of
feeling
he
would
have
cut
him
there
and
then
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
binding
on
him
to
continue
a
chance
acquaintance
but
being
full
at
the
moment
of
that
comprehensive
love
of
fellow
existences
which
some
constitutions
extract
from
inebriating
fluids
he
said
ah
how
are
you
glad
to
come
across
you
again
colburne
nodded
smiled
and
stopped
saying
can
i
do
anything
for
you
will
you
smoke
asked
the
offering
a
segar
but
how
to
light
it
there
the
rub
i
just
broken
my
last
match
against
this
cursed
wet
never
thought
of
the
dew
you
know
and
was
studying
the
machine
itself
to
see
if
i
could
get
up
to
it
and
into
it
i
have
matches
said
colburne
he
produced
them
they
lighted
and
walked
on
together
being
a
great
fancier
of
good
segars
and
of
moonlit
summer
walks
under
new
boston
elms
i
should
like
here
to
describe
how
sweetly
the
fragrance
of
the
havanas
rose
through
the
still
dewy
air
into
the
interlacing
arches
of
nature
cathedral
aisles
the
subject
would
have
its
charms
not
only
for
the
great
multitude
of
my
brother
smokers
but
for
many
young
ladies
who
dearly
love
the
smell
of
a
segar
because
they
like
the
creatures
who
use
them
at
a
later
period
of
this
history
if
i
see
that
i
am
likely
to
have
the
necessary
space
and
time
i
may
bloom
into
such
pleasant
episodes
come
to
my
room
said
the
soldier
taking
the
arm
of
the
civilian
hope
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
we
will
have
a
glass
of
ale
colburne
would
have
been
glad
to
refuse
he
was
modest
enough
to
feel
himself
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
company
of
men
of
fashion
and
moreover
he
was
just
sufficiently
jealous
of
the
not
to
desire
to
fraternize
with
him
finally
a
strong
suspicion
troubled
his
mind
that
this
military
personage
indifferent
to
new
boston
opinions
and
evidently
a
might
proceed
to
get
publicly
drunk
thus
making
a
disagreeable
scene
with
a
chance
of
future
scandal
why
then
did
not
colburne
decline
the
invitation
because
he
was
young
modest
and
wanting
in
that
social
tact
and
courage
which
most
men
only
acquire
by
much
intercourse
with
a
great
variety
of
their
fellow
creatures
the
walk
was
the
merest
trifle
unsteady
or
at
least
careless
and
his
herculean
arm
solid
and
knotted
as
an
limb
swayed
repeatedly
against
colburne
eliciting
from
him
a
approbation
proud
of
his
own
biceps
the
young
man
had
to
acknowledge
its
comparative
inferiority
in
volume
and
texture
are
you
a
gymnast
colonel
he
asked
your
arm
feels
like
it
sword
exercise
answered
the
other
very
good
thing
to
work
off
a
heavy
dinner
what
do
you
do
here
boat
it
eh
that
better
yet
i
fancy
but
the
sword
exercise
is
just
the
thing
for
your
profession
pshaw
beg
pardon
but
do
you
suppose
that
we
in
these
times
ever
fight
hand
to
hand
no
sir
gunpowder
has
killed
all
that
perhaps
there
never
was
much
real
hand
to
hand
fighting
suggested
colburne
look
at
the
battle
of
pharsalia
two
armies
of
romans
the
best
soldiers
of
antiquity
meet
each
other
and
the
defeated
party
loses
fifteen
thousand
men
killed
and
wounded
while
the
victors
lose
only
about
two
hundred
is
that
fighting
is
it
clear
that
men
began
to
run
away
when
they
got
within
about
ten
feet
of
c√¶sar
by
jove
you
right
bully
for
you
you
would
make
a
soldier
yes
and
if
c√¶sar
men
had
had
rifles
pompey
men
would
have
run
away
at
a
hundred
yards
all
victories
are
won
by
moral
force
by
the
terror
of
death
rather
than
by
death
itself
then
it
is
not
the
big
battalions
that
carry
the
day
inferred
colburne
the
weakest
battalions
will
win
if
they
will
stand
but
they
wo
stand
by
jove
as
soon
as
they
see
they
are
the
weakest
they
run
away
modern
war
is
founded
on
the
principle
that
one
man
is
afraid
of
two
of
course
you
must
make
allowance
for
circumstances
strength
of
position
fortifications
superior
discipline
and
superior
leadership
circumstances
are
sometimes
strong
enough
to
neutralize
look
here
are
you
interested
in
these
matters
why
do
you
go
into
the
army
what
the
devil
are
you
staying
at
home
for
when
the
whole
nation
is
arming
or
will
soon
have
to
arm
i
stammered
colburne
i
thought
of
applying
for
a
quartermaster
position
a
quartermaster
exclaimed
the
without
seeking
to
disguise
his
contempt
what
for
to
keep
out
of
the
fighting
no
said
colburne
meekly
but
i
do
know
a
little
of
the
ways
of
business
and
i
know
nothing
of
tactics
and
discipline
i
could
no
more
drill
a
company
than
i
could
sail
a
ship
i
should
be
like
the
man
who
mounted
such
a
tall
horse
that
he
not
only
could
manage
him
but
could
get
off
till
he
was
thrown
off
i
should
be
dismissed
for
incompetency
but
you
can
learn
all
that
you
can
learn
in
a
month
you
are
a
college
man
aint
you
you
can
learn
more
in
a
month
than
these
boors
from
the
militia
can
in
ten
years
i
tell
you
that
the
fellows
who
are
in
command
of
companies
in
my
regiment
and
in
all
the
volunteer
regiments
that
i
know

an
average

be
corporals

best
of
them
are
from
fair
to
middling
you
are
a
college
man

i
get
a
regiment

talk

over

at
his
room
carter
rang
for
scotch
ale
and
segars
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
he
became
exceedingly

the
ordinary
and
disagreeable
acceptation
of
the
word

my
mother

historically
puritan
and
colonial
the
whitewoods
are
somehow
related
to
me
by
the
way
a
virginian
i
suppose
you
think
it
queer
to
find
me
on
this
side
no
you
do
though
you
do
believe
in
the
state
right
of
secession
neither
do
i
was
educated
a
united
states
soldier
i
follow
general
scott
no
virginian
need
be
ashamed
to
follow
old
fuss
and
feathers
we
used
to
swear
by
him
in
the
army
great
scott
the
fellows
said
well
as
i
had
to
give
up
my
father
state
i
have
come
to
my
mother
i
want
old
barataria
to
distinguish
herself
now
the
chance
we
are
going
to
have
a
long
war
i
want
the
state
to
be
prepared
and
come
out
strong
it
the
grandest
chance
she
ever
have
to
make
herself
famous
i
been
to
see
the
governor
i
said
to
him
your
chance
now
the
chance
for
barataria
now
my
chance
it
going
to
be
a
long
war
do
depend
on
volunteering
it
wo
last
get
a
militia
system
ready
which
will
classify
the
whole
population
and
bring
it
into
the
fight
as
fast
as
it
needed
make
the
state
a
prussia
if
you
allow
me
i
draw
up
a
plan
which
shall
make
barataria
a
military
community
and
put
her
at
the
head
of
the
union
for
moral
and
physical
power
appoint
me
your
chief
of
staff
and
i
not
only
draw
up
the
plan
but
put
it
in
force
then
give
me
a
division
or
only
a
brigade
and
i
show
you
what
baratarians
can
do
on
the
now
what
do
you
think
the
governor
answered
governor
a
dam
fool
oh
no
protested
colburne
astonished
for
the
chief
magistrate
of
barataria
was
highly
respected
i
do
mean
individually
not
a
fool
explained
the
but
a
fool
from
the
necessity
of
the
case
mouthpiece
you
see
of
a
stupid
day
and
generation
what
can
he
do
he
asks
i
admit
it
he
ca
do
anything
but
what
democracy
permits
lose
the
next
election
he
says
well
i
suppose
he
would
and
that
answer
governor
wise
in
his
day
and
generation
although
a
fool
by
the
eternal
laws
of
military
i
do
know
as
i
talk
very
clearly
but
you
get
at
my
meaning
do
you
well
i
had
a
long
argument
and
gave
it
up
we
must
go
on
volunteering
and
commissioning
the
rusty
and
greasy
demagogues
who
bring
in
the
companies
the
rank
and
file
is
magnificent
ca
be
equalled
too
good
but
such
an
infernally
miserable
set
as
the
officers
average
some
bright
young
fellows
who
can
be
licked
into
shape
the
rest
old
deacons
tinkers
military
tailors
jew
pedlars
broken
down
stump
orators
cubs
who
have
learned
just
enough
of
tactics
to
know
how
not
to
do
it
look
at
the
man
that
i
a
virginian
gentleman
a
west
pointer
have
over
me
for
colonel
he
an
old
bloat
an
old
political
bloat
he
knows
no
more
of
tactical
evolutions
than
he
does
of
the
art
of
navigation
order
a
battalion
which
is
marching
division
front
to
break
into
platoons
you
do
understand
that
it
about
the
same
as
well
never
mind
it
ca
be
done
well
this
cursed
old
bloat
is
engineering
to
be
a
general
we
do
want
such
fellows
for
generals
nor
for
colonels
nor
for
captains
nor
for
privates
by
jove
if
barataria
had
to
fit
out
frigates
instead
of
regiments
i
wonder
if
she
would
put
such
men
in
command
of
them
democracy
might
demand
it
the
governor
would
know
better
but
he
might
be
driven
to
it
for
fear
of
losing
the
next
election
now
then
continued
the
i
come
to
business
we
shall
have
to
raise
more
regiments
i
shall
apply
for
the
command
of
one
of
them
and
shall
get
it
but
i
want
gentlemen
for
my
officers
i
am
a
gentleman
myself
and
a
west
pointer
i
do
want
tinkers
and
pedlars
and
country
deacons
you
a
college
man
aint
you
all
right
college
men
will
do
for
me
i
want
you
to
take
a
company
in
my
regiment
and
get
in
as
many
more
of
your
set
as
you
can
i
not
firing
blank
cartridge
my
tongue
may
be
thick
but
my
head
is
clear
will
you
do
it
i
will
decided
colburne
after
a
moment
of
earnest
consideration
the
problem
occurred
to
him
whether
this
man
clever
as
he
was
professional
soldier
as
he
was
but
apparently
a
follower
of
rash
john
barleycorn
would
be
a
wiser
leader
in
the
field
than
a
green
but
temperate
civilian
he
could
not
stop
to
settle
the
question
and
accepted
the
leadership
by
impulse
the
latter
thanked
him
cordially
and
then
laughed
aloud
evidently
because
of
that
moment
of
hesitation
do
think
i
this
way
always
he
said
never
when
on
duty
great
scott
no
man
can
say
that
indeed
i
not
badly
off
now
if
i
willed
it
i
could
be
as
logical
as
friend
whitewood
i
could
do
a
problem
in
euclid
but
it
would
be
a
devil
of
an
effort
you
wo
demand
it
of
me
will
you
it
an
odd
thing
in
man
he
went
on
gravely
how
he
can
govern
drunkenness
and
even
sickness
just
as
though
a
should
have
enough
not
to
explode
when
some
one
throws
a
live
coal
into
it
the
only
time
i
ever
got
drunk
clear
through
i
did
it
deliberately
i
was
to
cairo
caught
there
by
a
railroad
breakdown
and
had
to
stay
over
a
night
ever
at
cairo
it
is
the
dolefullest
cursedest
place
if
a
man
is
excusable
anywhere
for
drinking
himself
insensible
it
is
at
cairo
illinois
the
last
thing
i
recollect
of
that
evening
is
that
i
was
sitting
in
the
feet
against
a
pillar
debating
whether
i
would
go
quite
drunk
or
make
a
fight
and
stay
sober
i
said
to
myself
it
cairo
and
let
myself
go
my
next
distinct
recollection
is
that
of
waking
up
in
a
railroad
car
i
had
been
half
conscious
two
or
three
times
previously
but
had
gone
to
sleep
again
without
taking
notice
of
my
surroundings
this
time
i
looked
about
me
my
was
between
my
feet
and
my
in
the
rack
above
my
head
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
i
turned
to
the
gentleman
who
shared
my
seat
and
said
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
where
this
train
is
going
he
stared
as
you
may
suppose
but
replied
that
we
were
going
to
cincinnati
the
devil
we
are
thought
i
and
i
wanted
to
go
to
louis
i
afterwards
came
across
a
man
who
was
able
to
tell
me
how
i
got
on
the
train
he
said
that
i
came
down
at
five
in
the
morning
and
in
hand
settled
my
bill
in
the
most
rational
manner
possible
and
took
the
omnibus
to
the
railroad
station
now
it
my
belief
that
i
could
have
staved
off
that
drunken
fit
by
obstinacy
i
can
stave
this
one
off
you
shall
see
he
emptied
his
glass
lighted
a
fresh
segar
big
enough
to
floor
some
men
without
other
aid
and
commenced
walking
the
room
taking
it
diagonally
from
corner
to
corner
so
as
to
gain
a
longer
sweep
do
stir
he
said
do
mind
me
start
another
segar
and
try
the
ale
you
wo
what
an
inhuman
monster
of
abstinence
that
is
the
way
they
bring
us
up
in
new
boston
we
are
so
temperate
that
we
are
disposed
to
outlaw
the
raising
of
rye
you
mean
in
your
set
there
must
be
somebody
in
this
city
who
gets
jolly
there
is
everywhere
so
far
as
i
have
travelled
you
will
find
a
great
many
fellows
like
me
and
worse
in
the
old
army
and
good
reason
for
it
just
think
of
our
life
all
of
us
could
have
nice
places
in
charge
of
arsenals
or
at
newport
or
on
governor
island
i
was
five
years
on
the
frontier
and
in
california
before
i
got
to
baton
rouge
and
that
was
not
so
very
delightful
by
the
way
in
yellow
fever
seasons
now
imagine
yourself
in
command
of
a
company
garrisoning
fort
on
the
upper
missouri
seven
hundred
miles
from
an
opera
or
a
library
or
a
lady
or
a
mince
pie
or
any
other
civilizing
influence
the
captain
is
on
detached
service
somewhere
you
are
the
first
lieutenant
and
your
only
companion
is
brown
the
second
lieutenant
you
must
be
on
sociable
terms
with
the
men
because
you
are
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
you
have
read
your
few
books
and
talked
brown
dry
there
is
no
shooting
within
five
miles
of
the
fort
and
if
you
go
beyond
that
distance
the
blackfeet
will
raise
your
hair
what
is
there
to
save
you
from
suicide
but
that
one
way
we
come
to
drink
so
you
are
lucky
you
have
had
no
temptations
or
almost
none
in
this
little
puritan
city
there
are
some
bad
places
and
people
here
i
do
speak
of
it
boastingly
are
there
laughed
carter
i
delighted
to
hear
it
by
jove
when
my
father
went
through
college
here
there
was
a
chance
to
learn
anything
wicked
but
hypocrisy
chance
enough
for
that
judging
from
the
stories
he
told
me
so
old
whitewood
is
no
longer
the
exact
model
of
all
the
new
bostonians
not
even
in
the
university
there
used
to
be
such
a
solemn
set
of
professors
that
they
could
be
recognized
in
the
cemetery
because
they
had
so
much
the
air
of
tombstones
but
that
old
lot
has
nearly
died
out
and
been
succeeded
by
younger
men
of
quite
a
pleasant
cerulean
tint
they
have
studied
in
europe
they
like
paris
and
vienna
and
other
places
that
used
to
be
so
wicked
they
do
think
such
very
small
lager
of
the
german
theologians
they
accept
geology
and
discuss
darwin
with
patience
do
get
out
of
my
range
who
the
devil
is
darwin
never
mind
take
him
for
granted
go
on
with
your
professors
oh
i
hav
much
to
say
about
them
they
are
quite
agreeable
they
are
what
i
call
men
of
the
world
though
i
suppose
i
hardly
know
what
a
man
of
the
world
is
i
dare
say
i
am
like
the
mouse
who
took
the
first
dog
that
he
saw
for
the
elephant
that
he
had
heard
of
the
stopped
his
walk
and
surveyed
him
hands
in
pockets
a
smile
on
his
lip
and
a
silent
in
his
eye
men
of
the
world
are
they
by
jove
well
perhaps
so
i
hav
met
them
yet
but
if
it
comes
to
pointing
out
men
of
the
world
allow
me
to
indicate
our
louisiana
friend
ravenel
there
a
fellow
who
can
do
the
universally
agreeable
you
could
tell
this
evening
which
he
liked
best
whitewood
or
me
and
i
be
hanged
if
the
same
man
can
like
both
of
us
when
he
was
talking
with
the
professor
he
seemed
to
be
saying
to
himself
is
my
and
when
he
was
talking
with
me
his
whole
countenance
glowed
with
an
expression
which
stated
that
is
the
boy
what
a
diplomatist
he
would
make
i
like
him
immensely
he
has
a
charming
daughter
too
not
beautiful
exactly
but
very
charming
colburne
felt
an
oppression
which
would
not
allow
him
to
discuss
the
question
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
indignant
but
only
astonished
perhaps
also
a
little
pleased
at
the
tone
of
indifference
with
which
the
other
spoke
of
the
young
lady
his
soul
was
so
occupied
with
this
new
train
of
thought
that
i
doubt
whether
he
heard
understandingly
the
conversation
of
his
interlocutor
for
the
next
few
minutes
suddenly
it
struck
him
that
carter
was
entirely
sober
in
body
and
brain
colonel
would
you
like
to
go
on
a
he
asked
abruptly
political
thing
why
yes
think
i
ought
to
like
it
help
along
our
regiment
no
no
not
political
i
sorry
i
gave
you
such
an
exalted
expectation
now
you
be
disappointed
i
mean
an
affair
of
young
ladies
beaux
baskets
paper
parcels
sandwiches
cold
tongue
biscuits
and
lemonade
lemonade
said
carter
with
a
grimace
could
a
fellow
smoke
i
take
that
liberty
is
miss
ravenel
going
yes
i
accept
how
do
you
go
in
an
omnibus
i
will
see
that
you
are
taken
up
say
at
nine
morning
chapter
iv
the
dramatic
personages
go
on
a
and
study
the
ways
of
new
boston
when
the
awoke
in
the
morning
he
did
not
feel
much
like
going
on
a
he
had
a
slight
ache
in
the
top
of
his
head
a
huskiness
in
the
throat
a
woolliness
on
the
tongue
a
feverishness
in
the
cuticle
and
a
crawling
tremulousness
in
the
muscles
as
though
the
molecules
of
his
flesh
were
separately
alive
and
intertwining
themselves
he
drowsily
called
to
mind
a
old
gentleman
whom
he
had
seen
at
a
bar
trying
in
vain
to
gather
up
his
change
with
shaky
fingers
and
at
last
exclaiming
curse
the
change
and
walking
off
hastily
in
evident
mortification
ah
carter
you
will
come
to
that
yet
thought
the
to
be
sure
he
added
after
a
moment
this
sobering
one
self
by
main
strength
of
will
as
i
did
last
night
is
an
extra
trial
and
enough
to
shake
any
man
but
how
about
breakfast
and
that
confounded
was
his
next
reflection
carter
temperance
man
as
you
are
you
must
take
a
cocktail
or
you
wo
be
able
to
eat
a
mouthful
this
morning
he
rang
ordered
an
stiff
swallowed
it
and
looked
at
his
watch
eight
never
mind
he
would
wash
and
shave
then
decide
between
breakfast
and
thanks
to
his
martial
education
he
was
a
rapid
dresser
and
it
still
lacked
a
quarter
of
nine
when
he
appeared
in
the
dining
saloon
he
had
time
therefore
to
eat
a
mutton
chop
but
he
only
looked
at
it
with
a
disgusted
eye
his
stomach
being
satisfied
with
a
roll
and
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
outer
hall
he
lighted
a
segar
but
after
smoking
about
an
inch
of
it
threw
the
rest
away
it
was
decidedly
one
of
his
qualmish
mornings
and
he
was
glad
to
get
a
full
breath
of
out
of
door
air
is
my
hamper
ready
he
said
to
one
of
the
sir
my
hamper
confound
you
repeated
the
who
was
more
irritable
than
usual
this
morning
the
basket
that
i
ordered
last
night
go
and
ask
the
clerk
yes
sir
said
the
boy
when
he
returned
it
all
right
sir
there
it
is
sir
behind
the
door
the
omnibus
a
little
late
of
course
appeared
about
a
quarter
past
nine
besides
colburne
it
contained
three
ladies
two
of
about
and
one
of
accompanied
by
an
equal
number
of
beardless
slender
jauntily
dressed
youths
whom
the
took
for
the
ladies
younger
brothers
inferring
that
were
family
affairs
in
new
boston
surveying
these
juvenile
gentlemen
with
some
contempt
he
was
about
to
say
to
colburne
very
sorry
my
dear
fellow
but
really
do
feel
well
enough
to
go
out
when
he
caught
sight
of
miss
ravenel
are
you
going
she
asked
with
a
blush
which
was
so
indescribably
flattering
that
he
instantly
responded
yes
indeed
behind
miss
ravenel
came
the
doctor
who
immediately
inquired
after
carter
health
with
an
air
of
friendly
interest
that
contrasted
curiously
with
the
glance
of
suspicion
which
he
bent
on
him
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
libbie
hastened
into
the
omnibus
very
much
afraid
that
her
father
would
order
her
back
to
her
room
it
was
only
by
dint
of
earnest
begging
that
she
had
obtained
his
leave
to
join
the
and
she
knew
that
he
had
given
it
without
suspecting
that
this
army
gentleman
would
be
of
the
party
but
where
are
your
matrons
mr
colburne
asked
the
doctor
i
see
only
young
ladies
who
themselves
need
matronizing
the
beauty
of
looked
graciously
at
him
and
judged
him
a
perfect
gentleman
whitewood
goes
out
in
her
own
carriage
answered
colburne
the
doctor
bowed
professed
himself
delighted
with
the
arrangements
wished
them
all
a
pleasant
excursion
and
turned
away
with
a
smiling
face
which
became
exceedingly
serious
as
he
walked
slowly
up
stairs
it
was
not
thus
that
young
ladies
were
allowed
to
go
a
pleasuring
at
new
orleans
the
severe
proprieties
of
french
manners
with
regard
to
were
in
considerable
favor
there
her
mother
never
would
have
been
caught
in
this
way
he
thought
and
was
anxious
and
repentant
and
angry
with
himself
until
his
daughter
returned
in
the
omnibus
colburne
did
the
introductions
and
now
carter
discovered
that
the
beardless
young
gentlemen
were
not
the
brothers
of
the
ladies
but
most
evidently
their
cavaliers
and
was
therefore
left
to
infer
that
the
beaux
of
new
boston
are
blessed
with
an
immortal
youth
or
rather
childhood
he
could
hardly
help
laughing
aloud
to
think
how
he
had
been
caught
in
such
a
nursery
sort
of
he
glanced
from
one
downy
face
to
another
with
a
cool
mocking
look
which
no
one
understood
but
miss
ravenel
who
was
the
only
other
person
in
the
party
to
whom
the
sight
of
such
juvenile
gallants
was
a
rarity
she
bit
her
lips
to
repress
a
smile
and
desperately
opened
the
conversation
i
am
so
anxious
to
see
the
eagle
nest
she
said
to
one
of
the
students
oh
you
never
saw
it
he
replied
there
were
two
things
in
this
response
which
surprised
miss
ravenel
in
the
first
place
the
young
gentleman
blushed
violently
at
being
addressed
in
the
second
he
spoke
in
a
very
hoarse
and
weak
tone
his
voice
being
not
yet
established
unable
to
think
of
anything
further
to
say
he
turned
for
aid
to
the
maiden
of
between
whom
and
himself
there
was
a
tender
feeling
as
appeared
openly
later
in
the
day
she
set
him
on
his
intellectual
pins
by
commencing
a
conversation
on
the
exhibition
what
is
the
asked
lillie
it
is
a
burlesque
honor
in
college
answered
the
youth
it
used
to
be
given
to
the
stupidest
fellow
in
the
graduating
class
now
it
given
to
the
jolliest
fellow
most
popular
fellow
smartest
fellow
that
take
a
real
honor
allow
me
to
ask
sir
are
you
a
candidate
inquired
the
miss
ravenel
cringed
at
this
unprovoked
and
not
very
brilliant
brutality
the
collegian
merely
stammered
no
sir
and
blushed
immoderately
he
was
too
much
puzzled
by
the
other
impassable
stare
to
comprehend
the
sneer
at
once
but
he
studied
it
much
during
the
day
and
that
night
writhed
over
the
memory
of
it
till
towards
morning
both
carter
and
the
lady
of
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
of
themselves
for
taking
unfair
advantage
of
the
simplicity
and
sensitiveness
of
this
lad
but
the
feminine
sinner
had
at
least
this
excuse
that
it
was
the
angelic
spirit
of
love
and
not
the
demoniac
spirit
of
scorn
which
prompted
her
conduct
perceiving
that
her
boy
was
being
abused
she
inveigled
him
into
a
corner
of
the
vehicle
where
they
could
talk
together
without
interruption
the
conversation
of
lovers
is
not
usually
interesting
to
outsiders
except
as
a
subject
of
laughter
it
is
frequently
stale
and
flat
to
a
degree
which
seems
incomprehensible
when
you
consider
the
strong
feelings
of
the
interlocutors
this
is
the
ordinary
sort
of
thing
at
least
in
new
boston
smiling
did
you
go
out
yesterday
smiling
yes
where
only
down
to
the
many
people
in
the
streets
not
very
many
and
all
the
while
the
two
persons
are
not
thinking
of
the
walk
nor
of
the
nor
of
the
people
in
the
streets
nor
of
anything
of
which
they
speak
they
are
thinking
of
each
other
they
are
prattling
merely
to
be
near
each
other
they
are
so
full
of
each
other
that
they
can
not
talk
of
foreign
subjects
interestingly
and
so
the
babble
has
a
meaning
which
the
unsympathetic
does
not
comprehend
after
circulating
through
the
city
to
pick
up
the
various
invited
ones
the
omnibus
was
joined
by
a
second
omnibus
and
two
or
three
family
rockaways
the
little
fleet
of
vehicles
then
sailed
into
the
country
and
at
the
end
of
an
hour
voyage
came
to
anchor
under
the
lee
of
a
wooded
cliff
called
the
eagle
nest
which
was
the
projected
site
of
the
up
the
long
slope
which
formed
the
back
of
the
cliff
a
number
of
baskets
and
demijohns
were
carried
by
the
youthful
beaux
of
the
party
with
a
zeal
which
older
gallants
might
not
have
exhibited
carter
weighty
hamper
was
taken
care
of
by
a
couple
of
juniors
who
jumped
to
the
task
on
learning
that
it
belonged
to
a
united
states
army
officer
he
offered
repeatedly
to
relieve
them
but
they
would
not
suffer
it
in
a
roundabout
and
inarticulate
manner
they
were
exhibiting
the
fervent
patriotism
of
the
time
as
well
as
that
perpetual
worship
which
young
men
pay
to
their
superiors
in
age
and
knowledge
of
the
world
and
oh
how
was
virtue
rewarded
when
the
basket
was
opened
and
its
contents
displayed
it
was
not
for
the
roast
chicken
that
the
two
frolicsome
juniors
cared
the
companion
baskets
around
were
crammed
with
edibles
of
all
manner
of
flesh
and
fowl
it
was
the
sight
of
six
bottles
of
champagne
which
made
their
eyes
rejoice
but
with
a
holy
horror
equal
to
their
wicked
joy
did
all
the
matrons
of
the
party
and
indeed
more
than
half
of
the
younger
people
stare
carter
champagne
was
the
only
spirit
of
a
vinous
or
ardent
nature
present
and
when
he
produced
two
bunches
of
segars
from
his
pockets
and
proceeded
to
distribute
them
the
moral
excitation
reached
its
height
immediately
there
were
opposing
partisans
in
the
those
who
meant
to
take
a
glass
of
champagne
and
smoke
a
segar
if
it
were
only
for
the
wicked
fun
of
the
thing
and
those
who
meant
not
only
that
they
would
not
smoke
nor
drink
themselves
but
that
nobody
else
should
these
last
formed
little
groups
and
discussed
the
affair
with
conscientious
bitterness
but
what
to
do
the
atrocity
puzzled
them
by
its
very
novelty
the
memory
of
woman
did
not
go
back
to
the
time
when
an
aristocratic
new
boston
had
been
so
desecrated
i
say
the
memory
of
advisedly
and
upon
arithmetical
calculation
for
in
this
party
the
age
of
the
males
averaged
at
least
five
years
less
than
that
of
the
females
why
do
you
stop
it
mrs
whitewood
said
the
maiden
of
with
girlish
enthusiasm
you
are
the
oldest
person
here
whitewood
did
not
look
particularly
flattered
by
this
statement
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
order
anything
whitewood
looked
as
if
she
would
like
to
order
the
young
lady
to
let
her
alone
if
i
were
you
i
would
step
out
there
and
say
gentlemen
this
must
be
stopped
whitewood
might
have
replied
why
do
you
say
it
yourself
you
are
old
enough
but
she
did
not
such
sarcastic
observations
never
occurred
to
her
soul
nor
had
she
been
endowed
with
thousands
of
similar
conceits
would
she
have
dared
utter
one
it
was
impossible
to
rub
her
up
to
the
business
of
confronting
and
putting
down
the
adherents
of
the
champagne
basket
she
did
think
of
speaking
to
carter
privately
about
it
but
before
she
could
decide
in
what
terms
to
address
him
the
last
bottle
had
been
cracked
and
then
of
course
it
was
useless
to
say
anything
so
in
much
horror
of
spirit
and
with
many
for
her
weakness
she
gazed
helplessly
upon
what
she
considered
a
scene
of
wicked
revelry
in
fact
there
was
a
good
deal
of
jollity
and
racket
the
six
bottles
of
champagne
made
a
pretty
strong
dose
for
the
unaccustomed
heads
of
the
dozen
lads
and
three
or
four
young
ladies
who
finished
them
carter
himself
cloyed
with
the
surfeit
of
yesterday
took
almost
nothing
to
the
wonder
and
even
i
suspect
to
the
disappointment
of
the
temperance
party
but
he
made
himself
dreadfully
obnoxious
by
urging
his
sillery
upon
every
one
including
the
whitewoods
and
the
maiden
of
the
latter
declined
the
proffered
glass
with
an
air
of
virtuous
indignation
which
struck
him
as
uncivil
more
particularly
as
it
evoked
a
triumphant
smile
from
the
adherents
of
lemonade
with
a
cruelty
without
parallel
and
for
which
i
shall
not
attempt
to
excuse
him
he
immediately
offered
the
bumper
to
the
young
gentleman
on
whose
arm
the
lady
leaned
with
the
observation
madam
i
hope
you
will
allow
your
son
to
take
a
little
the
unhappy
couple
walked
away
in
a
speechless
condition
the
two
juniors
heretofore
mentioned
burst
into
hysterical
gulphs
of
laughter
and
then
pretended
that
it
was
a
simultaneous
attack
of
coughing
there
were
no
more
attempts
to
put
down
the
audacious
army
gentleman
and
he
was
accorded
that
which
we
all
grant
to
a
bull
in
a
he
was
himself
somewhat
shocked
by
the
sensation
which
he
had
produced
what
an
awful
row
he
whispered
to
colburne
i
have
plunged
this
nursery
into
a
state
of
civil
war
when
you
said
how
could
i
suppose
that
it
was
a
excursion
by
the
way
it
sunday
is
it
do
you
always
do
it
this
way
in
new
boston
but
you
are
not
immaculate
you
do
some
things
here
which
would
draw
down
the
frown
of
society
in
other
places
look
at
those
couples
a
young
fellow
and
a
girl
strolling
off
by
themselves
among
the
thickets
some
of
them
have
been
out
of
sight
for
half
an
hour
i
should
think
it
would
make
talk
i
should
think
whitewood
who
seems
to
be
matron
in
chief
would
stop
it
i
tell
you
it
would
do
in
new
york
or
philadelphia
or
any
such
place
except
among
the
lower
classes
you
do
catch
our
young
louisianienne
making
a
dryad
of
herself
i
heard
one
of
these
lads
ask
her
to
take
a
walk
in
the
grove
on
top
of
the
hill
and
i
saw
her
decline
with
a
blush
which
certainly
expressed
astonishment
and
i
think
indignation
now
how
the
devil
can
these
old
girls
who
have
lived
long
enough
to
be
able
to
put
two
and
two
together
be
so
inconsistent
after
regarding
me
with
horror
for
offering
them
a
glass
of
champagne
they
will
commit
imprudences
which
make
them
appear
as
if
they
had
drunk
a
bottle
of
it
and
yet
just
look
i
have
too
much
delicacy
to
ask
one
of
those
young
ones
to
stroll
off
with
me
in
the
wo
you
have
a
segar
i
do
believe
miss
ravenel
objects
to
tobacco
they
smoke
in
louisiana
yes
and
they
chew
and
drink
too
shocking
fast
set
i
really
hope
the
child
never
will
marry
down
there
i
take
an
interest
in
her
you
and
i
will
go
out
there
some
day
and
reconquer
her
patrimony
and
put
her
in
possession
of
it
and
then
ask
her
which
she
will
have
colburne
had
already
talked
a
good
deal
with
miss
ravenel
she
was
so
discouraging
to
the
student
beaux
and
carter
had
been
so
general
in
his
attentions
with
a
view
to
getting
the
champagne
into
circulation
that
she
had
fallen
chiefly
to
the
young
lawyer
as
to
the
women
she
did
not
much
enjoy
their
conversation
at
that
time
everybody
at
the
north
was
passionately
loyal
especially
those
who
would
not
in
any
chance
be
called
upon
to
fight
and
this
loyalty
was
expressed
towards
persons
of
secessionist
proclivities
with
a
frank
energy
which
the
latter
considered
brutal
incivility
from
the
male
sex
miss
ravenel
obtained
some
compassion
or
polite
forbearance
but
from
her
own
very
little
and
the
result
was
that
she
avoided
ladies
and
might
perhaps
have
been
driven
to
suffer
the
boy
beaux
only
that
she
could
make
sure
of
the
society
of
colburne
important
as
this
young
gentleman
was
to
her
she
could
not
forbear
teasing
him
concerning
the
local
peculiarities
of
new
boston
this
afternoon
she
was
satirical
upon
the
juvenile
gallants
you
seem
to
be
the
only
man
in
new
boston
she
said
i
suppose
all
the
males
are
executed
when
they
are
found
guilty
of
being
how
came
you
to
escape
perhaps
you
are
the
executioner
why
do
you
do
your
office
on
the
i
should
like
to
answered
colburne
miss
ravenel
colored
but
gave
no
other
sign
of
comprehension
i
do
like
old
beaux
persisted
colburne
oh
i
do
when
i
left
new
orleans
i
parted
from
a
beau
of
forty
forty
how
could
you
come
away
why
you
know
that
i
hated
to
leave
new
orleans
yes
but
i
never
knew
the
reason
before
did
you
say
forty
yes
sir
just
forty
is
there
anything
strange
in
a
man
of
forty
being
agreeable
i
do
see
that
you
new
bostonians
find
it
difficult
to
like
ladies
of
forty
but
i
hav
told
you
the
worst
i
have
another
beau
whom
i
like
better
than
anybody
who
is
your
father
you
are
very
clever
as
you
are
so
bright
perhaps
you
can
explain
a
mystery
to
me
why
is
it
that
these
grown
women
are
so
fond
of
the
society
of
these
students
they
do
seem
to
care
to
get
a
word
from
carter
i
do
think
they
are
crazy
after
you
they
are
altogether
absorbed
in
making
the
time
pass
pleasantly
to
these
boys
it
is
so
in
all
little
university
towns
ca
you
understand
it
when
a
girl
is
fifteen
a
student
is
naturally
a
more
attractive
object
to
her
than
a
mechanic
or
a
shopkeeper
boy
she
thinks
that
to
be
a
student
is
the
chief
end
of
man
that
the
world
was
created
in
order
that
there
might
be
students
frequently
he
is
a
southerner
and
you
know
how
charming
southerners
are
oh
i
know
all
about
it
well
the
girl
of
fifteen
takes
a
fancy
to
a
freshman
she
flirts
with
him
all
through
the
four
years
of
his
course
then
he
departs
promising
to
come
back
but
never
keeping
his
promise
perhaps
by
this
time
she
is
really
attached
to
him
and
that
or
habit
or
her
original
taste
for
romance
and
strangers
gives
her
a
cant
for
life
she
never
flirts
with
anything
but
a
student
afterwards
ca
relish
a
man
who
has
a
flavor
of
greek
and
latin
generally
she
sticks
to
the
senior
class
when
she
gets
into
the
thirties
she
sometimes
enters
the
theological
seminary
in
search
of
prey
but
she
never
likes
anything
which
has
a
student
smack
it
reminds
one
of
the
story
that
when
a
shark
has
once
tasted
human
flesh
he
will
not
eat
any
other
unless
driven
to
it
by
hunger
what
a
brutal
comparison
one
consequence
of
this
fascination
continued
colburne
is
that
new
boston
is
full
of
unmarried
females
there
is
a
story
in
college
that
a
student
threw
a
stone
at
a
dog
and
missing
him
hit
seven
old
maids
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
good
results
these
old
girls
are
bookish
and
mature
and
their
conversation
is
improving
to
the
they
sacrifice
themselves
as
woman
wont
is
for
the
good
of
others
if
you
ever
come
to
new
orleans
i
will
show
you
a
fascinating
lady
of
thirty
she
is
my
aunt
or
cousin
i
hardly
know
which
to
call
her
larue
she
has
beautiful
black
hair
and
eyes
she
is
a
true
type
of
louisiana
and
you
are
not
what
right
had
you
to
be
a
blonde
because
i
am
my
father
daughter
his
eyes
are
blue
he
came
from
the
of
south
carolina
there
are
plenty
of
blondes
there
this
conversation
the
reader
perceives
is
not
monumentally
grand
or
important
next
in
flatness
to
the
ordinary
talk
of
two
lovers
comes
i
think
the
ordinary
talk
of
two
young
persons
of
the
opposite
sexes
in
the
first
place
they
are
young
and
therefore
have
few
great
ideas
to
interchange
and
but
limited
ranges
of
experience
to
compare
in
the
second
place
they
are
hampered
and
embarrassed
by
the
mute
but
potent
consciousness
of
sex
and
the
alarming
possibility
of
marriage
i
am
inclined
to
give
much
credit
to
the
saying
that
only
married
people
and
vicious
people
are
agreeably
fluent
in
an
assembly
of
both
sexes
when
therefore
i
report
the
conversation
of
these
two
uncorrupted
young
persons
as
being
of
a
moderately
dull
quality
i
flatter
myself
that
i
am
publishing
the
very
truth
of
nature
but
it
follows
that
we
had
best
finish
with
this
as
soon
as
possible
we
will
suppose
the
chickens
and
sandwiches
eaten
the
champagne
drunk
the
segars
smoked
the
party
gathered
into
the
omnibusses
and
rockaways
and
the
vehicle
in
which
we
are
chiefly
interested
at
the
door
of
the
new
boston
house
as
the
enters
with
miss
ravenel
a
waiter
hands
him
a
telegraphic
message
excuse
me
he
says
and
reads
as
they
ascend
the
stairs
together
on
the
parlor
floor
he
halts
and
takes
her
hand
with
an
air
of
more
seriousness
than
he
has
yet
exhibited
miss
ravenel
i
must
bid
you
i
am
so
sorry
i
leave
for
washington
immediately
my
application
for
extension
of
leave
has
been
refused
i
do
sincerely
hope
that
i
shall
meet
you
again
good
bye
she
simply
said
not
unaware
that
her
hand
had
been
pressed
and
for
that
reason
unable
or
unwilling
to
add
more
he
left
her
there
hurried
to
his
room
packed
his
valise
and
was
off
in
twenty
minutes
for
when
it
was
necessary
to
move
quick
he
could
put
on
a
rate
of
speed
not
easily
equalled
miss
ravenel
walked
to
her
father
room
in
deep
meditation
without
stating
the
fact
in
words
she
felt
that
the
presence
of
this
mature
masculine
worldly
gentleman
of
the
army
was
agreeable
to
her
and
that
his
farewell
had
been
an
unpleasant
surprise
if
he
was
inebriate
dissipated
dangerous
it
must
be
remembered
that
she
did
not
know
it
in
simply
smelling
of
wine
and
segars
he
had
an
odor
of
louisiana
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
from
childhood
even
in
the
grave
society
of
her
father
choice
and
which
was
naturally
grateful
to
the
homesick
sensibilities
of
the
exiled
girl
for
the
last
hour
or
two
doctor
ravenel
had
paced
his
room
in
no
little
excitement
he
was
a
notably
industrious
man
and
had
devoted
the
day
to
writing
an
article
on
the
mineralogy
of
arkansas
but
even
this
labor
the
utterance
of
a
scientific
enthusiasm
could
not
divert
him
from
what
i
may
call
maternal
anxieties
why
did
i
let
her
go
on
that
silly
expedition
he
repeated
to
himself
it
is
the
last
time
absolutely
the
last
at
this
moment
she
entered
the
room
and
kissed
him
with
more
than
ordinary
effusion
she
meant
to
forestall
his
expected
reproof
for
her
unexpectedly
long
absence
moreover
she
felt
a
very
little
lonely
and
in
need
of
unusual
affection
in
consequence
of
that
farewell
my
dear
how
late
you
are
said
the
unappeased
doctor
how
could
you
stay
out
so
how
could
you
do
it
the
idea
of
staying
out
till
dusk
i
am
astonished
really
girls
have
no
prudence
they
are
no
more
fit
to
take
care
of
themselves
amid
the
dangers
and
stupidities
of
society
than
so
many
goslings
among
the
wheels
and
hoofs
of
a
crowded
street
do
not
suppose
that
miss
ravenel
bore
these
reproofs
with
the
serene
countenance
of
fra
angelico
seraphs
softly
beaming
out
of
a
halo
of
eternal
love
she
was
very
much
mortified
very
much
hurt
and
even
a
little
angry
a
hard
word
from
her
father
was
an
exceeding
great
trial
to
her
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
the
color
into
her
cheeks
and
neck
while
all
her
slender
form
trembled
not
visibly
but
consciously
as
if
her
veins
were
filled
with
quicksilver
late
why
no
papa
running
to
the
window
and
pointing
to
the
crimson
west
why
the
sun
is
only
just
gone
down
look
for
yourself
papa
well
is
too
late
if
for
nothing
else
just
think
of
the
dew
the
chill
i
am
not
pleased
i
tell
you
lillie
i
am
not
pleased
now
papa
you
are
right
hard
i
do
say
you
are
right
cruel
how
could
i
help
myself
i
could
come
home
alone
i
could
order
the
to
break
up
and
come
home
when
i
pleased
how
could
i
just
think
of
it
papa
the
doctor
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
head
bent
forward
he
had
hardly
looked
at
his
daughter
he
never
looked
at
her
when
he
scolded
her
he
gave
her
a
now
and
seeing
her
eyes
full
of
tears
he
was
unable
to
answer
her
either
good
or
evil
the
earnestness
of
his
affection
for
her
made
him
very
sensitive
and
sore
and
cowardly
in
case
of
a
misunderstanding
she
was
looking
at
him
all
the
time
that
she
talked
her
face
full
of
her
troubled
eagerness
to
exculpate
herself
and
now
though
he
said
not
a
word
she
knew
him
well
enough
to
see
that
he
had
relented
from
his
anger
encouraged
by
this
discovery
she
regained
in
a
moment
or
two
her
she
guessed
the
real
cause
or
at
least
the
strongest
cause
of
his
vexation
and
proceeded
to
dissipate
it
papa
i
think
there
must
be
something
important
going
on
in
the
army
carter
has
received
a
telegraph
and
is
going
on
by
the
next
train
he
halted
in
his
walk
and
faced
her
with
a
childlike
smile
of
pleasure
has
he
indeed
he
said
as
gaily
as
if
he
had
heard
of
some
piece
of
personal
good
fortune
then
more
gravely
and
with
a
censorious
countenance
quite
time
he
went
i
should
say
it
does
look
well
for
an
officer
to
be
enjoying
himself
here
in
barataria
when
his
men
may
be
fighting
in
virginia
miss
ravenel
thought
of
suggesting
that
the
had
been
on
sick
leave
but
concluded
that
it
would
not
be
well
to
attempt
his
defence
at
the
present
moment
well
lillie
resumed
the
doctor
after
taking
a
couple
of
leisurely
turns
up
and
down
the
room
i
do
know
but
i
have
been
unjust
in
blaming
you
for
coming
home
so
late
i
must
confess
that
i
do
see
how
you
could
help
it
the
fault
was
not
yours
it
resulted
from
the
very
nature
of
all
such
expeditions
it
is
one
of
the
inconveniences
of
that
common
sense
is
never
invited
or
never
has
time
to
go
i
wonder
that
whitewood
should
permit
such
irrational
procedures
the
doctor
was
somewhat
apt
to
exaggerate
whether
in
praise
or
blame
when
he
became
interested
in
a
subject
well
well
i
am
chiefly
in
fault
myself
he
concluded
it
must
be
the
last
time
my
dear
you
had
better
take
off
your
things
and
get
ready
for
tea
while
lillie
was
engaged
on
her
toilette
the
doctor
cogitated
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
say
something
against
this
carter
but
that
he
had
better
say
it
indirectly
so
as
they
sauntered
down
stairs
to
the
he
broke
out
upon
the
bibulous
gentry
of
louisiana
herald
will
amuse
you
he
said
it
contains
the
proceedings
of
a
meeting
of
the
planters
of
dominic
parish
they
are
opposed
to
freedom
they
object
to
the
nineteenth
century
they
mean
to
smash
the
united
states
of
america
and
for
all
this
they
pledge
their
lives
their
fortunes
and
their
sacred
honor
it
surpasses
all
the
jokes
in
joe
miller
to
think
of
those
ruffians
with
a
bottle
of
louisiana
rum
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
a
revolver
in
one
pocket
and
a
in
the
other
drunken
swearing
gambling
depraved
as
satan
with
their
black
wives
and
mulatto
children
to
think
of
such
ruffians
prating
about
their
sacred
honor
why
they
absolutely
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
they
have
heard
of
respectable
communities
possessing
such
a
quality
as
honor
and
they
feel
bound
to
talk
as
if
they
possessed
it
the
pirates
of
the
isle
of
pines
might
as
well
pledge
their
honesty
and
humanity
their
lives
their
fortunes
and
their
sacred
honor
their
lives
are
not
worth
the
powder
that
will
blow
them
out
of
existence
their
fortunes
will
be
worth
less
in
a
couple
of
years
and
as
for
their
sacred
honor
it
is
a
pure
figment
of
ignorant
imaginations
made
delirious
by
bad
whiskey
that
drinking
is
a
ruinous
vice
when
i
see
a
man
soaking
himself
with
sherry
at
a
friend
table
after
having
previously
soaked
with
whiskey
in
some
groggery
i
think
i
see
the
devil
behind
his
chair
putting
the
infernal
mark
on
the
back
of
his
coat
and
it
is
such
a
common
vice
in
louisiana
there
is
hardly
a
young
man
free
from
it
in
the
country
districts
when
a
young
fellow
is
paying
attention
to
a
young
lady
the
parents
do
ask
whether
he
is
in
the
habit
of
getting
drunk
they
take
that
for
granted
and
only
concern
themselves
to
know
whether
he
gets
or
if
the
former
they
have
some
hesitation
if
the
latter
they
consent
to
the
match
thankfully
miss
ravenel
understood
perfectly
that
her
father
was
cutting
at
carter
over
the
shoulders
of
the
convivial
gentlemen
of
louisiana
she
thought
him
unjust
to
both
parties
but
concluded
that
she
would
not
argue
the
question
being
conscious
that
the
subject
was
rather
too
delicately
near
to
her
feelings
to
be
discussed
without
danger
of
disclosures
well
they
are
rushing
to
their
doom
resumed
the
doctor
turning
aside
to
general
reflections
either
because
such
was
the
tendency
of
his
mind
or
because
he
thought
that
he
had
demolished
the
they
could
wait
for
whiskey
to
finish
them
as
it
does
other
barbarous
races
they
must
call
on
the
political
mountains
to
crush
them
their
slaveholding
sodom
will
perish
for
the
lack
of
five
just
men
or
a
single
just
idea
it
must
be
razed
and
got
out
of
the
way
like
any
other
obstacle
to
the
progress
of
humanity
it
must
make
room
for
something
more
consonant
with
the
railroad
inductive
philosophy
and
practical
christianity
chapter
the

from
bull
run
papa
are
we
going
to
stay
in
new
boston
forever
asked
miss
ravenel
my
dear
i
am
afraid
we
shall
both
have
to
die
some
day
after
which
we
ca
expect
to
stay
here
pleasant
as
it
might
be
replied
the
doctor
nonsense
papa
you
know
what
i
mean
are
you
going
to
make
new
boston
a
permanent
place
of
residence
how
can
i
tell
my
dear
we
ca
go
back
to
new
orleans
at
present
and
where
else
should
we
go
you
know
that
i
must
consult
economy
in
my
choice
of
a
residence
my
bank
deposits
are
not
monstrous
and
there
is
no
telling
how
long
i
may
be
cut
off
from
my
resources
new
boston
presents
two
advantages
it
gives
me
some
employment
and
it
is
tolerably
cheap
through
the
friendliness
of
these
excellent
professors
i
am
kept
constantly
busy
and
am
not
paid
so
very
badly
though
i
ca
say
that
i
am
in
any
danger
of
growing
suddenly
rich
then
i
have
the
run
of
the
university
library
which
is
a
great
thing
finally
where
else
in
the
united
states
should
we
find
a
prettier
or
pleasanter
little
city
the
people
are
dreadfully
poky
my
daughter
i
wish
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
converse
with
me
in
english
i
never
became
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
gold
coast
dialects
and
not
even
with
the
court
language
of
ashantee
it
is
ashantee
at
all
everybody
says
poky
and
it
is
real
poky
in
you
to
pretend
not
to
understand
it
do
you
think
so
yourself
now
besides
these
new
bostonians
are
so
ferociously
federal
i
ca
say
a
word
for
the
south
but
the
women
glare
at
me
as
though
they
wanted
to
hang
me
on
a
sour
apple
tree
like
jeff
davis
my
dear
if
one
of
these
loyal
ladies
should
say
a
word
for
her
own
lawful
government
in
new
orleans
she
would
be
worse
than
glared
at
i
doubt
whether
the
of
your
native
city
would
let
her
off
with
plain
hanging
let
us
thank
heaven
that
we
are
among
civilized
people
who
only
glare
at
us
and
do
not
stick
us
under
the
fifth
rib
when
we
differ
with
them
in
opinion
oh
papa
how
bitter
you
are
on
the
southerners
it
seems
to
me
you
must
forget
that
you
were
born
in
south
carolina
and
have
lived
years
in
louisiana
oh
oh
the
beautiful
reason
for
defending
organized
barbarism
suppose
i
had
had
the
misfortune
of
being
born
in
the
isle
of
pines
would
you
have
me
therefore
be
the
apologist
of
piracy
i
do
hope
that
i
am
perfectly
free
from
the
prejudices
and
trammels
of
geographical
morality
my
body
was
born
amidst
slavery
but
my
conscience
soon
found
the
underground
railroad
i
am
not
boasting
at
least
i
hope
not
i
have
had
no
plantations
no
patrimony
of
human
flesh
very
few
temptations
in
short
to
bow
down
to
the
divinity
of
ashantee
i
sincerely
thank
heaven
for
these
three
things
that
i
never
owned
a
slave
that
i
was
educated
at
the
north
and
that
i
have
been
able
to
visit
the
free
civilization
of
europe
but
why
did
you
live
in
louisiana
if
it
was
such
a
sodom
papa
ah
there
you
have
me
perhaps
it
was
because
i
had
an
expensive
daughter
to
support
and
could
pick
up
four
or
five
thousand
dollars
a
year
there
easier
than
anywhere
else
but
you
see
i
am
suffering
for
having
given
my
countenance
to
sin
i
have
escaped
out
of
the
burning
city
like
lot
with
only
my
family
it
is
my
daily
wonder
lillie
that
you
are
not
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
the
only
reason
probably
is
that
the
age
of
miracles
is
over
papa
when
i
am
as
old
as
you
are
and
you
are
as
young
as
i
am
satirize
you
well
if
we
are
going
to
live
in
new
boston
why
ca
we
keep
house
it
costs
more
for
two
people
to
keep
house
than
to
board
our
furniture
rent
food
fuel
lights
and
servants
would
come
to
more
than
the
eighteen
dollars
a
week
which
we
pay
here
now
that
we
have
given
up
our
parlor
in
a
civilized
country
is
expensive
but
is
it
exactly
nice
to
stay
forever
in
a
hotel
english
travellers
make
such
an
outcry
about
american
families
living
in
hotels
i
know
at
the
bottom
it
is
bad
but
it
is
a
sad
necessity
of
american
society
so
long
as
we
have
untrained
servants
black
barbarians
at
the
south
and
mutinous
foreigners
at
the
north
many
american
housekeepers
will
throw
down
their
keys
in
despair
and
rush
for
refuge
to
the
hotels
and
numbers
produce
respectability
at
least
in
a
democracy
so
we
must
give
up
the
idea
of
a
nice
little
house
all
to
ourselves
i
am
afraid
so
unless
i
should
happen
to
find
diamonds
in
the
basaltic
formation
of
the
eagle
nest
the
doctor
falls
to
his
writing
and
miss
ravenel
to
her
embroidery
presently
the
young
lady
without
having
anything
in
particular
to
say
is
conscious
of
a
desire
for
further
conversation
and
after
searching
for
a
subject
begins
as
follows
papa
have
you
been
in
the
parlor
this
morning
yes
my
dear
answers
papa
scratching
away
desperately
with
his
quill
pen
whom
did
you
see
there
see
where
oh
i
saw
andrew
smith
says
the
doctor
at
first
then
looking
a
little
quizzical
what
did
he
have
to
say
why
my
dear
he
spoke
so
low
that
i
could
hear
what
he
said
he
did
responds
miss
ravenel
all
interest
what
did
that
mean
why
did
you
ask
him
to
repeat
it
because
my
dear
he
was
talking
to
me
he
was
talking
to
mrs
smith
here
miss
ravenel
perceives
that
her
habitual
curiosity
is
being
made
fun
of
and
replies
papa
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
my
child
you
give
me
some
chance
to
write
retorts
the
doctor
or
else
you
must
learn
to
sit
a
little
in
your
own
room
of
course
i
prefer
to
have
you
here
but
i
do
demand
that
you
accord
me
some
infinitesimal
degree
of
consideration
father
and
daughter
used
to
have
many
conversations
not
very
dissimilar
to
the
above
it
was
a
constant
prattle
when
they
were
together
unless
the
doctor
raised
the
standard
of
revolt
and
refused
to
talk
in
order
that
he
might
work
ever
since
lillie
earliest
recollection
they
had
been
on
these
same
terms
of
sociability
companionship
almost
equality
the
intimacy
and
democracy
of
the
relation
arose
partly
from
the
doctor
extreme
fondness
for
children
and
young
people
and
partly
from
the
fact
that
he
had
lost
his
wife
early
so
that
in
his
household
life
he
had
for
years
depended
for
sympathy
upon
his
daughter
twice
or
thrice
every
morning
the
doctor
was
obliged
to
remonstrate
against
lillie
talkativeness
something
after
the
manner
of
an
affectionate
old
cat
who
allows
her
pussy
to
jump
on
her
back
and
bite
her
ears
for
a
half
hour
together
but
finally
imposes
quiet
by
a
velvety
and
harmless
cuffing
occasionally
he
avenged
himself
for
her
untimely
demands
on
his
attention
by
reading
to
her
what
he
considered
a
successful
passage
of
the
article
which
he
might
then
be
composing
in
this
however
he
had
not
the
least
intention
of
punishment
but
supposed
that
he
was
conferring
a
pleasure
it
was
an
essential
element
of
this
genial
social
sympathetic
nature
to
believe
that
whatever
interested
him
would
necessarily
interest
those
whom
he
loved
and
even
those
with
whom
he
simply
came
in
contact
when
lillie
offered
corrections
on
his
style
which
happened
frequently
he
rarely
hesitated
to
accept
them
vanity
he
had
none
or
at
any
rate
displayed
none
except
on
two
subjects
his
daughter
and
his
scientific
fame
as
a
proof
of
this
last
he
gloried
in
an
extensive
correspondence
with
european
and
made
lillie
read
every
one
of
those
letters
written
on
paper
and
with
foreign
stamps
and
postmarks
on
their
envelopes
which
reached
him
from
across
the
atlantic
although
medicine
was
his
profession
and
had
provided
him
with
bread
he
had
latterly
fallen
in
love
with
mineralogy
and
in
his
vacation
wanderings
though
that
mountainous
belt
which
runs
from
the
carolinas
westward
to
arkansas
and
missouri
he
had
discovered
some
new
species
which
were
eagerly
sought
for
by
the
directors
of
celebrated
european
collections
great
was
his
delight
at
receiving
in
new
boston
a
weighty
box
of
specimens
which
he
had
shipped
as
freight
from
new
orleans
just
previous
to
his
own
departure
but
which
for
two
months
he
had
mourned
over
as
lost
it
dowered
him
with
an
embarrassment
of
riches
during
a
week
his
bed
sofa
table
chairs
and
floor
were
littered
with
the
scraps
of
paper
and
tufts
of
cotton
and
of
spanish
moss
which
had
served
as
wrappers
and
with
hundreds
of
crystals
ores
and
other
minerals
over
this
confusion
the
doctor
domineered
with
a
face
wrinkled
by
happy
anxiety
laying
down
one
pebble
to
pick
up
another
pronouncing
this
a
smithite
and
that
a
brownite
trying
his
blowpipe
on
them
and
then
his
hammer
and
covering
all
the
furniture
with
a
layer
of
learned
smudge
and
dust
and
gravel
papa
you
have
puckered
your
forehead
up
till
it
is
like
a
baked
apple
lillie
would
remonstrate
you
look
more
than
five
thousand
years
old
you
look
as
though
you
might
be
the
grandfather
of
all
the
mummies
now
do
leave
off
bothering
those
poor
smithites
and
hivites
and
amelekites
and
come
and
take
a
walk
my
dear
you
hav
the
least
idea
how
necessary
it
is
to
push
discoveries
to
a
certainty
as
quickly
as
possible
would
answer
the
doctor
meanwhile
peering
at
a
specimen
through
his
magnifying
glass
the
world
wo
wait
for
me
to
take
your
time
if
i
do
work
fast
enough
in
my
researches
it
will
set
somebody
else
at
the
job
it
makes
no
allowance
for
louisiana
ideas
of
leisure
and
here
he
suddenly
breaks
off
his
moralizing
and
exclaims
my
dear
this
is
a
brownite
it
is
a
robinsonite
a
most
unquestionable
and
superb
robinsonite
oh
papa
i
wish
i
was
an
unquestionable
robinsonite
then
you
would
take
some
sort
of
interest
in
me
says
miss
lillie
but
the
doctor
is
lost
in
the
ocean
of
his
new
discovery
and
for
fifteen
minutes
has
not
a
word
to
say
on
any
subject
comprehensible
to
the
young
lady
two
hours
of
every
afternoon
were
devoted
by
father
and
daughter
to
a
long
walk
in
company
sometimes
a
mere
shopping
or
calling
tour
but
generally
an
excursion
into
the
pure
country
of
fields
and
forest
as
yet
so
easily
reached
from
the
centre
of
new
boston
the
doctor
preserved
a
reminiscence
of
his
college
botany
and
attempted
to
impart
some
of
his
knowledge
of
plants
to
lillie
but
she
was
a
hopeless
scholar
she
persisted
in
caring
for
little
except
human
beings
and
such
literature
as
related
directly
to
them
meaning
thereby
history
biography
novels
and
poetry
she
remained
delightfully
innocent
of
all
the
ologies
you
ought
to
have
been
born
four
thousand
years
ago
lillie
he
exclaimed
in
despair
over
some
new
instance
of
her
incapacity
to
move
in
his
favorite
grooves
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
linn√¶us
humboldt
lyell
faraday
agassiz
and
dana
might
as
well
not
have
lived
i
believe
you
will
go
through
life
without
more
knowledge
of
science
than
just
enough
to
distinguish
between
a
plant
and
a
pebble
i
do
hope
so
papa
replied
the
incorrigible
and
delightful
ignoramus
when
they
met
one
of
their
acquaintance
on
these
walks
the
doctor
would
not
allow
him
to
pass
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
after
the
unobtrusive
new
boston
fashion
he
would
stop
him
shake
hands
cordially
inquire
earnestly
after
his
health
and
family
and
before
parting
contrive
to
say
something
personally
civil
if
not
complimentary
all
of
which
would
evidently
flatter
the
new
bostonian
but
would
also
as
evidently
discompose
him
and
turn
his
head
as
being
a
man
unaccustomed
to
much
social
incense
papa
you
trouble
these
people
lillie
would
sometimes
expostulate
they
do
know
where
to
put
all
your
civilities
and
courtesies
they
do
seem
to
have
pockets
for
them
my
child
i
am
nothing
more
than
ordinarily
polite
nothing
more
than
ordinary
in
louisiana
but
something
very
extraordinary
here
i
have
just
thought
why
all
the
gentlemen
one
meets
at
the
south
are
so
civil
it
is
because
the
uncivil
ones
are
shot
as
fast
as
they
are
discovered
there
is
something
in
that
admitted
the
doctor
i
suppose
duelling
has
something
to
do
with
the
superficial
good
manners
current
down
there
but
just
consider
what
an
impolite
thing
shooting
is
in
itself
to
knock
and
jam
and
violently
push
a
man
into
the
other
world
is
one
of
the
most
boorish
and
barbarous
discourtesies
that
i
can
imagine
how
should
i
like
to
be
treated
that
way
i
think
i
never
should
be
reconciled
to
the
fact
or
its
author
but
these
new
bostonians
are
so
poky
so
awfully
serious
i
have
some
consideration
for
they
are
not
amusing
but
they
are
generally
useful
it
is
well
for
the
race
no
doubt
to
have
many
persons
always
in
solemn
earnest
i
do
know
what
the
world
would
come
to
if
every
body
could
see
a
joke
possibly
it
might
laugh
itself
to
death
frequently
on
these
walks
they
were
met
and
joined
by
colburne
that
young
gentleman
frank
as
his
clear
hazel
eyes
and
hearty
laugh
made
him
appear
was
awkwardly
sly
in
bringing
about
these
ostensibly
accidental
meetings
not
that
his
clumsy
male
cunning
deceived
miss
ravenel
she
was
not
by
any
means
fond
enough
of
him
to
fail
to
see
through
him
she
knew
that
he
walked
in
her
paths
with
malice
aforethought
her
father
did
not
know
it
nor
suspect
it
nor
ever
by
any
innate
consciousness
or
outward
hint
feel
his
attention
drawn
toward
the
circumstance
and
what
was
most
absurd
of
all
colburne
persisted
in
fearing
that
the
doctor
that
travelled
and
learned
man
of
the
world
guessed
the
secret
of
his
slyness
but
never
once
attributed
that
degree
of
to
the
daughter
i
sometimes
get
quite
out
of
patience
with
the
ugly
sex
it
is
so
densely
stupid
with
regard
to
these
little
social
riddles
for
example
it
happened
once
at
a
party
that
while
colburne
who
never
danced
was
talking
to
miss
ravenel
another
gentleman
claimed
her
hand
for
a
quadrille
she
took
her
place
in
the
set
but
first
handed
her
fan
to
colburne
now
every
lady
who
observed
this
action
understood
that
miss
ravenel
had
said
to
colburne
as
plainly
as
it
was
possible
to
express
the
thing
without
speaking
or
using
force
that
she
wished
him
to
return
to
her
side
as
soon
as
the
quadrille
was
over
and
that
in
fact
she
preferred
his
conversation
to
that
of
her
dancing
admirer
but
this
masculine
blunderer
comprehended
nothing
he
grumbled
to
himself
that
he
was
to
be
put
off
with
the
honor
of
holding
a
fan
while
the
other
fellow
ran
away
with
the
owner
and
so
shoving
the
toy
into
his
pocket
he
absented
himself
for
half
an
hour
to
the
justifiable
disapprobation
of
miss
ravenel
who
did
not
again
give
him
any
thing
to
hold
for
many
evenings
but
this
was
an
exceptional
piece
of
stupidity
in
colburne
and
probably
he
would
not
have
been
guilty
of
it
but
for
a
spasm
of
jealousy
he
was
not
grossly
deficient
in
social
tact
any
more
than
in
natural
cleverness
or
in
acquired
information
conversation
and
very
sensible
conversation
too
flowed
like
a
river
when
he
came
into
confluence
with
the
ravenels
the
prevailing
subject
as
a
matter
of
course
was
the
rebellion
it
was
every
body
subject
it
was
the
nightmare
by
night
and
the
delirium
by
day
of
the
american
people
it
was
the
one
thing
that
no
one
ignored
and
no
one
for
an
hour
forgot
the
twenty
loyal
millions
of
the
north
shuddered
with
rage
at
the
insolent
wickedness
of
those
conspirators
who
merely
that
they
might
perpetuate
human
bondage
and
their
own
political
supremacy
proposed
to
destroy
the
grandest
social
fabric
that
liberty
ever
built
the
city
of
refuge
for
oppressed
races
the
hope
of
the
nations
for
men
who
through
such
a
glorious
temple
as
this
could
rush
with
destroying
torches
and
the
cry
of
rule
or
ruin
the
north
felt
a
horror
more
passionate
than
ever
on
any
occasion
for
any
cause
thrilled
the
bosom
of
any
other
people
this
indignation
was
earnest
and
in
proportion
to
the
civilization
of
the
century
and
the
intelligence
of
the
population
the
hundreds
of
telegraph
lines
and
thousands
of
printing
presses
in
the
united
states
sent
the
knowledge
of
every
new
treason
and
the
reverberation
of
every
throb
of
patriotic
anger
in
a
day
to
all
americans
outside
of
nurseries
and
lunatic
asylums
the
excitement
of
germany
at
the
opening
of
the
thirty
years
war
of
england
previous
to
the
cromwellian
struggle
was
torpid
and
partial
in
comparison
with
this
outburst
of
a
modern
reading
and
free
democracy
as
yet
there
was
little
bloodshed
the
old
respect
for
law
and
confidence
in
the
processes
of
reason
could
not
at
once
die
and
men
still
endeavored
to
convince
each
other
by
argument
while
holding
the
pistol
to
each
other
heads
but
from
the
lawrence
to
the
gulf
there
was
a
spiritual
preparedness
for
slaughter
which
was
to
end
in
such
murderous
contests
as
should
make
ensanguined
europe
rise
from
its
thousand
to
stare
in
wonder
women
and
children
were
as
wild
with
the
patriotic
excitement
as
men
some
of
the
prettiest
and
ladies
of
new
boston
waited
in
a
mixed
crowd
half
the
night
at
the
railroad
station
to
see
the
first
regiments
pass
towards
washington
and
flung
their
handkerchiefs
rings
and
other
trinkets
to
the
astonished
country
lads
to
show
them
how
the
heart
of
woman
blessed
the
nation
defenders
in
no
society
could
you
be
ten
minutes
without
hearing
the
words
war
treason
rebellion
and
so
the
subject
being
every
body
subject
the
ravenels
and
colburne
frequently
talked
of
it
it
was
quite
a
sad
and
sore
circumstance
to
the
two
gentlemen
that
the
lady
was
a
rebel
to
a
man
who
prides
himself
on
his
superior
capacity
and
commanding
nature
that
is
to
say
to
almost
every
man
in
existence
there
can
be
few
greater
grievances
than
a
woman
whom
he
can
not
convert
and
more
particularly
and
painfully
is
this
true
when
she
bears
some
near
relationship
to
him
as
for
instance
that
of
a
wife
sister
daughter
and
sweetheart
thus
ravenel
the
father
and
colburne
the
admirer
fretted
daily
over
the
obstinate
treasonableness
of
miss
lillie
patriotism
she
called
it
declaring
that
louisiana
was
her
country
and
that
to
it
she
owed
her
allegiance
it
is
worthy
of
passing
remark
how
loyal
the
young
are
to
the
prevailing
ideas
of
the
community
in
which
they
are
nurtured
you
will
find
adult
republicans
in
england
but
no
infant
ones
adults
monarchists
in
our
own
country
but
not
in
our
schools
and
nurseries
i
have
known
an
american
of
fifty
whose
beliefs
prejudices
and
tastes
were
all
european
but
who
could
not
save
his
five
children
from
being
all
yankee
accordingly
this
young
lady
of
nineteen
born
and
nurtured
among
louisianians
held
firm
for
louisiana
in
spite
of
the
arguments
of
the
adored
papa
and
the
rather
agreeable
admirer
the
doctor
liked
colburne
and
respected
his
intellect
he
rarely
tired
of
talking
with
him
on
any
subject
and
concerning
the
war
they
could
go
on
interminably
the
only
point
on
which
they
disagreed
was
the
probable
length
of
the
contest
the
southerner
prophecying
that
it
would
last
five
or
six
years
and
the
northerner
that
the
rebels
would
succumb
in
as
many
months
miss
ravenel
sometimes
said
that
the
north
would
give
up
in
a
year
and
sometimes
that
the
war
would
last
forty
years
both
of
which
opinions
she
had
heard
sustained
in
new
orleans
but
whatever
she
said
she
always
believed
in
the
superior
pluck
and
warlike
skill
of
the
people
of
her
own
section
miss
ravenel
said
colburne
i
believe
you
think
that
all
southerners
are
giants
so
tall
that
they
ca
see
a
yankee
without
lying
down
and
so
pugnacious
that
they
never
go
to
church
without
praying
for
a
chance
to
fight
somebody
she
resented
this
satire
by
observing
colburne
if
i
believe
it
you
ought
not
to
dispute
it
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
young
man
in
these
days
rather
damaged
his
chances
of
winning
the
young
lady
kind
regards
to
use
a
hackneyed
and
therefore
decorous
phrase
by
his
stubborn
and
passionate
loyalty
to
the
old
starry
banner
it
was
impossible
that
the
two
should
argue
so
much
on
a
subject
which
so
deeply
interested
both
without
occasionally
coming
to
spiritual
blows
but
why
should
colburne
win
the
kind
regards
of
miss
ravenel
if
she
were
his
wife
how
could
he
support
her
he
had
little
and
she
had
nothing
while
they
were
talking
over
the
war
it
went
on
one
balmy
summer
day
our
little
debating
club
of
three
sat
in
one
of
the
small
iron
balconies
of
the
hotel
discussing
the
great
battle
which
had
been
fought
and
rumor
said
won
on
the
heights
around
manassas
junction
for
a
week
the
city
had
been
wild
about
the
to
richmond
movement
and
the
excitement
culminated
in
a
general
joy
which
was
impatient
for
official
announcements
flags
bells
and
cannon
it
was
true
that
there
was
one
suspicious
circumstance
that
for
hours
no
telegrams
concerning
the
fight
had
come
over
the
wires
from
washington
but
excepting
a
few
habitual
croakers
and
secret
copperheads
who
were
immediately
frowned
into
silence
no
one
predicted
evil
tidings
at
the
last
accounts
the
grand
army
of
the
potomac
was
driving
before
it
the
traitorous
battalions
of
the
south
mcdowell
had
gained
a
great
victory
and
there
was
an
end
of
rebellion
i
do
believe
it
i
do
believe
it
miss
ravenel
repeatedly
asseverated
until
her
father
scolded
her
for
her
absurd
and
disloyal
incredulity
the
telegraph
is
in
order
again
observed
colburne
i
heard
one
of
those
men
who
just
passed
say
so
here
comes
somebody
that
we
know
whitewood
i
say
whitewood
any
thing
on
the
the
pale
young
student
looked
up
with
a
face
of
despair
and
eyes
full
of
tears
it
all
up
colburne
said
he
our
men
are
running
throwing
away
their
guns
and
every
thing
his
trembling
voice
hardly
sufficed
for
even
this
short
story
of
shame
and
disaster
miss
ravenel
the
desperate
rebel
jumped
to
her
feet
with
a
nervous
shriek
of
joy
and
then
catching
her
father
reproving
eye
rushed
up
stairs
and
danced
it
out
in
her
own
room
it
impossible
remonstrated
colburne
in
such
excitement
that
his
voice
was
almost
a
scream
why
by
the
last
accounts
oh
that
all
gone
up
groaned
whitewood
who
was
in
such
a
state
of
grief
that
he
could
hardly
talk
intelligibly
we
got
more
we
got
the
end
of
the
battle
johnson
came
up
on
our
right
and
we
are
whipped
all
to
pieces
johnson
why
where
was
patterson
patterson
is
an
old
traitor
shouted
whitewood
pushing
wildly
on
his
way
as
if
too
sick
at
heart
to
talk
more
it
is
very
sad
observed
the
doctor
gravely
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
for
his
own
interests
he
had
better
have
stayed
in
new
orleans
but
he
lost
sight
of
it
immediately
in
his
sorrow
for
the
seeming
calamity
which
had
befallen
country
and
liberty
and
the
human
race
oh
it
horrible
horrible
i
do
believe
it
i
ca
believe
it
groaned
colburne
it
too
much
to
bear
i
must
go
home
it
makes
me
too
sick
to
talk
chapter
vi
colburne
sees
his
way
clear
to
be
a
soldier
stragglers
arrived
and
then
the
regiments
people
were
not
angry
with
the
beaten
soldiers
but
treated
them
with
tenderness
gave
them
plentiful
cold
collations
and
lavished
indignation
on
their
ragged
shoddy
uniforms
then
the
little
state
at
first
pulseless
with
despair
took
a
long
breath
of
relief
when
it
found
that
beauregard
had
not
occupied
washington
and
set
bravely
about
preparing
for
far
bloodier
battles
than
that
of
bull
run
carter
did
not
return
with
his
regiment
and
colburne
read
with
a
mixture
of
emotions
that
he
had
been
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
while
gallantly
leading
a
charge
he
marked
the
passage
and
left
the
paper
with
his
compliments
for
the
ravenels
after
debating
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
whether
he
should
call
on
them
and
deciding
in
the
negative
not
being
able
as
yet
to
appreciate
that
blessing
in
disguise
bull
run
his
loyal
heart
was
very
sad
and
sore
over
it
and
he
felt
a
thrill
of
something
like
horror
whenever
he
thought
of
the
joyful
shriek
with
which
lillie
had
welcomed
the
shocking
tidings
he
was
angry
with
her
or
at
least
he
tried
to
be
he
called
up
his
patriotism
that
strongest
of
new
england
isms
and
resolved
that
with
a
secessionist
a
woman
who
wished
ill
to
her
country
he
would
not
fall
in
love
but
to
be
sure
of
this
he
must
keep
away
from
her
for
thus
much
of
love
or
of
perilous
inclination
at
least
he
already
had
to
acknowledge
and
moreover
while
he
was
somewhat
ashamed
of
the
feeling
he
still
could
not
heartily
desire
to
eradicate
it
troubled
thus
concerning
the
affairs
of
the
country
and
of
his
own
heart
he
kept
aloof
from
the
ravenels
for
three
or
four
days
then
he
said
to
himself
that
he
had
no
cause
for
avoiding
the
doctor
and
that
to
do
so
was
disgraceful
treatment
of
a
man
who
had
proved
his
loyalty
by
taking
up
the
cross
of
exile
this
story
will
probably
have
no
readers
so
destitute
of
sympathy
with
the
young
and
loving
as
that
they
can
not
guess
the
result
of
colburne
internal
struggles
after
two
or
three
chance
conversations
with
ravenel
he
jumped
or
to
speak
more
accurately
he
gently
slid
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
absurd
and
unmanly
to
make
a
distinction
in
favor
of
the
father
and
against
the
daughter
quarrel
with
a
woman
how
ridiculous
how
unchivalrous
he
colored
to
the
tips
of
his
repentant
ears
as
he
thought
of
it
and
of
what
miss
ravenel
must
think
of
it
he
hastened
to
call
on
her
before
the
breach
which
he
had
made
between
her
and
himself
should
become
untraversable
for
although
the
embargo
on
their
intercourse
had
lasted
only
about
a
week
it
already
seemed
to
him
a
lapse
of
time
measureable
by
months
and
this
very
naturally
inasmuch
as
during
that
short
interval
he
had
lived
a
life
of
anguish
as
a
man
and
a
patriot
accordingly
the
old
intimacy
was
resumed
and
the
two
young
people
seldom
passed
hours
apart
but
of
the
rebellion
they
said
little
and
of
bull
run
nothing
these
were
such
sore
subjects
to
him
that
he
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
them
except
to
the
ear
of
sympathy
and
she
divining
his
sensitiveness
would
not
give
him
pain
notwithstanding
that
he
was
an
abolitionist
and
a
yankee
if
the
doctor
ignorant
of
what
passed
in
these
young
hearts
turned
the
conversation
on
the
war
lillie
became
silent
and
colburne
appreciating
her
forbearance
tried
to
say
very
little
thus
without
a
compact
without
an
explanation
they
accorded
in
a
strain
of
mutual
charity
which
predicted
the
ultimate
conversion
of
one
or
the
other
moreover
colburne
asked
himself
what
right
had
he
to
talk
if
he
did
not
fight
if
he
wanted
to
answer
this
woman
outcry
of
delight
over
the
rout
of
bull
run
the
place
to
do
it
was
not
a
safe
parlor
but
a
field
of
victorious
battle
why
did
he
not
act
in
accordance
with
these
truly
chivalrous
sentiments
why
not
fall
into
one
of
the
new
regiments
which
his
gallant
little
state
was
organizing
to
continue
the
struggle
why
not
march
on
with
the
soul
of
old
john
brown
joining
in
the
sublime
though
quaint
chorus
of
we
coming
father
abraham
three
hundred
thousand
more
he
did
talk
very
earnestly
of
it
with
various
persons
and
among
others
with
doctor
ravenel
the
latter
approved
the
young
man
warlike
inclinations
promptly
and
earnestly
it
is
the
noblest
duty
that
you
may
ever
have
a
chance
to
perform
during
your
life
said
he
to
do
something
personally
towards
upholding
this
union
and
striking
down
slavery
is
an
honor
beyond
any
thing
that
ever
was
accorded
to
greek
or
roman
i
wish
that
i
were
young
enough
for
the
work
or
fitted
for
it
by
nature
or
education
i
would
be
willing
to
have
my
tombstone
set
up
next
year
if
it
could
only
bear
the
inscription
died
in
giving
freedom
to
slaves
oh
do
stop
implored
lillie
who
entered
in
time
to
hear
the
concluding
sentence
what
do
you
talk
about
your
tombstone
for
you
will
get
perfectly
addled
about
abolition
like
all
the
rest
now
papa
you
ought
to
be
more
consistent
you
did
use
to
be
so
violent
against
slavery
you
have
changed
since
five
years
ago
i
know
it
says
the
doctor
but
that
does
prove
that
i
am
wrong
now
i
was
infallible
five
years
ago
why
my
dear
the
progress
of
our
race
from
barbarism
to
civilization
is
through
the
medium
of
constant
change
if
the
race
is
benefited
by
it
why
not
the
individual
i
am
a
sworn
foe
to
consistency
and
conservation
to
stick
obstinately
to
our
old
opinions
because
they
are
old
is
as
foolish
as
it
would
be
in
a
to
hold
on
to
his
shell
after
he
had
outgrown
it
instead
of
picking
up
a
new
one
fitted
to
his
increased
size
suppose
the
snakes
persisted
in
going
about
in
their
last
year
skins
no
no
there
are
no
such
fools
in
the
lower
animal
kingdom
that
stupidity
is
confined
to
man
the
world
does
move
observed
colburne
we
consider
ourselves
pretty
strict
and
here
in
new
boston
but
if
our
puritan
ancestors
could
get
hold
of
us
they
would
be
likely
to
have
us
whipped
as
heretics
and
very
likely
we
would
be
equally
severe
upon
our
own
if
we
should
get
a
chance
at
them
weak
spirits
are
frightened
by
this
change
this
growth
this
forward
impetus
said
the
doctor
i
must
tell
you
a
story
i
was
travelling
in
georgia
three
years
ago
on
the
seat
next
in
front
of
me
sat
a
cracker
who
was
evidently
making
his
first
railroad
experience
and
in
other
respects
learning
to
go
on
his
hind
legs
presently
the
train
crossed
a
bridge
it
was
narrow
uncovered
and
without
sides
so
that
a
passenger
would
not
be
likely
to
see
it
unless
he
sat
near
the
window
now
the
cracker
sat
next
the
alley
of
the
car
and
away
from
the
window
i
observed
him
give
a
glare
at
the
river
and
turn
away
his
head
suddenly
after
which
he
rolled
about
in
a
queer
way
and
finally
went
on
the
floor
in
a
heap
we
picked
him
up
spirits
were
easily
produced
they
always
are
down
there
and
presently
the
cracker
was
brought
to
his
senses
his
first
words
were
she
lit
he
was
under
the
impression
that
the
train
had
taken
the
river
at
a
running
jump
now
that
is
very
much
like
the
judgment
of
timid
and
people
on
the
progress
of
the
nation
or
race
at
such
a
time
as
this
they
know
about
the
bridge
they
think
we
are
flying
through
the
air
and
so
they
go
off
in
general
colburne
laughed
as
many
another
man
has
done
before
him
at
this
good
old
story
on
our
train
said
he
on
the
train
of
human
progress
we
are
parts
of
the
engine
and
not
mere
passengers
i
ought
to
be
revolving
somewhere
i
ought
to
be
at
work
i
want
to
do
something
i
am
most
anxious
to
do
something
but
i
do
know
precisely
what
i
suppose
that
the
inability
exists
in
me
and
not
in
my
circumstances
i
am
like
the
gentleman
who
tired
himself
out
with
jumping
but
never
could
jump
high
enough
to
see
over
his
own
i
know
how
you
feel
i
have
been
in
that
state
myself
often
and
in
various
ways
for
instance
it
has
occurred
to
me
especially
in
my
younger
days
to
feel
a
strong
desire
to
write
without
having
anything
to
say
there
was
a
burning
in
my
brain
there
was
a
sentiment
or
sensation
which
led
me
to
seek
pens
ink
and
paper
there
was
an
impatient
uncertain
aimless
effort
to
commence
there
was
a
pause
a
revery
and
all
was
over
it
was
a
storm
of
there
were
glorious
gleams
and
far
off
openings
of
the
heavens
but
no
sound
droppings
no
sensible
revelation
from
the
upper
however
your
longings
are
for
action
and
i
am
convinced
that
you
will
find
your
opportunity
there
will
be
work
enough
in
this
matter
for
all
i
do
know
said
colburne
the
sixth
and
seventh
regiments
are
full
i
hear
that
there
is
a
lieutenantcy
left
you
will
have
to
raise
your
own
company
ah
but
for
what
regiment
we
sha
raise
another
i
am
afraid
yes
i
am
actually
afraid
that
the
war
will
be
over
in
six
months
miss
ravenel
looked
up
hastily
as
if
she
should
like
to
say
forty
years
but
checked
herself
by
a
surprising
effort
of
magnanimity
and
good
nature
that
queer
patriotism
laughed
the
doctor
but
let
me
assure
you
colburne
that
your
fears
are
groundless
there
will
be
more
regiments
needed
miss
ravenel
gave
a
slight
approving
nod
but
still
said
nothing
remembering
bull
run
and
how
provokingly
she
had
shouted
over
it
this
southern
oligarchy
continued
the
doctor
will
be
a
tough
nut
to
crack
it
has
the
consolidated
vigor
of
a
tyranny
i
wonder
where
carter
is
queried
colburne
it
is
six
weeks
since
he
was
taken
prisoner
it
seems
like
six
years
miss
ravenel
raised
her
head
with
an
air
of
interest
glanced
hastily
at
her
father
and
gave
herself
anew
to
her
embroidery
the
doctor
made
a
grimace
which
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
thought
small
beer
or
sour
beer
of
carter
he
is
a
very
fine
officer
said
colburne
he
was
highly
spoken
of
for
his
conduct
at
bull
run
i
would
rather
have
you
for
a
colonel
replied
the
doctor
colburne
laughed
contemptuously
at
the
idea
of
his
fitness
for
a
colonelcy
i
would
rather
have
any
respectable
man
of
tolerable
intellect
insisted
the
doctor
i
tell
you
that
i
know
that
type
perfectly
i
know
what
he
is
as
well
as
if
i
had
been
acquainted
with
him
for
twenty
years
he
is
what
we
southerners
in
our
barbarous
local
vanity
are
accustomed
to
call
a
southern
gentleman
he
is
on
the
model
of
the
of
dominic
parish
he
needs
somebody
to
care
for
him
let
me
tell
you
a
story
when
i
was
on
a
mineralogical
expedition
in
north
carolina
some
years
ago
i
happened
to
be
out
late
at
night
looking
for
lodgings
i
was
approaching
one
of
those
groggeries
which
they
call
a
tavern
down
there
when
i
met
a
most
curious
couple
it
was
a
man
and
a
goose
the
man
was
drunk
and
the
goose
was
sober
the
man
was
staggering
and
the
goose
was
waddling
perfectly
straight
every
few
steps
it
halted
looked
back
and
quacked
as
if
to
say
come
along
the
moon
was
shining
and
i
could
see
the
whole
thing
plainly
i
was
obliged
to
put
up
for
the
night
in
the
groggery
and
there
i
got
an
explanation
of
the
comedy
it
seems
that
this
goose
was
a
pet
and
had
taken
an
unaccountable
affection
to
its
owner
who
was
a
wretched
drunkard
of
a
cracker
the
man
came
nearly
every
night
to
the
groggery
got
drunk
as
regularly
as
he
came
and
generally
went
to
sleep
on
one
of
the
benches
about
midnight
the
goose
would
appear
and
cackle
for
him
the
would
shake
up
the
drunkard
and
say
your
goose
has
come
for
you
as
soon
as
the
brute
could
get
his
legs
he
would
start
homeward
guided
by
his
more
intelligent
companion
if
the
man
fell
down
and
could
get
up
the
goose
would
remain
by
him
and
squawk
vociferously
for
now
sir
there
was
hardly
a
hardly
a
southern
gentleman
in
dominic
parish
who
did
need
some
such
guardian
often
and
often
as
i
have
seen
them
swilling
wine
and
brandy
at
each
other
tables
i
have
charitably
wished
that
i
could
say
to
this
one
and
that
one
sir
your
goose
has
come
for
you
but
you
never
have
seen
the
so
badly
off
answered
colburne
after
a
short
meditation
why
no
not
precisely
admitted
the
doctor
but
i
know
his
type
he
presently
added
with
an
obstinacy
which
miss
ravenel
secretly
thought
very
unjust
she
thought
it
best
to
direct
her
spirit
of
censure
in
another
direction
papa
said
she
what
a
countryfied
habit
you
have
of
telling
stories
do
criticise
my
dear
answers
papa
i
am
a
high
toned
southern
gentleman
and
always
knock
people
on
the
head
who
criticise
me
the
question
still
returns
upon
us
why
colburne
did
not
join
the
army
it
is
time
therefore
to
state
the
hitherto
unimportant
fact
that
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
widow
and
that
his
life
was
a
necessity
to
her
not
only
as
a
consolation
to
her
loneliness
but
as
a
support
to
her
declining
fortunes
doctor
colburne
had
left
his
wife
and
child
an
estate
of
about
thousand
dollars
which
at
the
time
of
his
death
was
a
respectable
fortune
in
new
boston
but
the
influx
of
gold
from
california
and
the
consequent
rise
of
prices
seriously
diminished
the
value
of
the
family
income
just
about
the
time
that
edward
by
growing
into
manhood
and
entering
college
necessitated
an
increase
of
expenses
therefore
colburne
was
led
to
put
one
half
of
the
joint
fortune
into
certain
manufacturing
companies
which
promised
to
increase
her
annual
six
per
cent
to
nor
was
she
therein
exceedingly
to
blame
being
led
away
by
the
example
and
advice
of
some
of
the
sharpest
new
boston
capitalists
many
of
whom
had
their
experienced
pinions
badly
lamed
in
these
adventurings
what
you
want
colburne
said
a
director
is
an
investment
which
is
both
safe
and
permanent
now
this
is
just
the
thing
i
can
not
say
much
for
the
safety
of
the
investment
but
it
certainly
was
a
permanent
one
during
the
first
year
the
promised
per
cent
was
paid
and
the
widow
could
have
sold
out
for
one
hundred
and
twenty
then
came
a
democratic
improvement
on
the
tariff
the
manufacturing
interest
of
the
country
was
paralyzed
and
the
braggville
stock
fell
to
ninety
colburne
might
still
have
sold
out
at
a
profit
counting
in
her
first
year
dividend
but
as
it
was
not
in
her
inexperience
to
see
that
this
was
wisdom
she
held
on
for
a
decline
by
the
opening
of
the
war
her
certificates
of
manufacturing
stock
were
waste
paper
and
her
annual
income
was
reduced
to
eight
hundred
dollars
indeed
for
a
year
or
two
previous
to
the
commencement
of
this
story
she
had
been
forced
to
make
inroads
upon
her
capital
of
this
crisis
in
the
family
affairs
edward
was
fully
aware
and
like
a
industrious
yankee
did
his
best
to
meet
it
from
every
lowermost
branch
and
twig
of
his
profession
he
plucked
some
fruit
by
dint
of
constant
watchfulness
so
that
during
the
past
year
he
had
been
very
nearly
able
to
cover
his
own
conscientiously
economical
expenditures
he
was
gaining
a
foothold
in
the
law
although
he
as
yet
had
no
cases
to
plead
if
he
held
on
a
year
or
two
longer
at
this
rate
he
might
confidently
expect
to
restore
the
family
income
and
stave
off
the
threatened
sale
of
the
homestead
but
this
was
not
all
which
prevented
him
from
going
forth
to
battle
the
cry
of
his
mother
heart
was
my
son
how
can
i
let
thee
go
she
was
an
abolitionist
as
was
almost
every
body
of
her
set
in
new
boston
she
was
an
enthusiastic
patriot
as
was
almost
every
one
in
the
north
during
that
sublime
summer
of
popular
enthusiasm
but
this
war
oh
this
strange
ferocious
war
was
horrible
her
sensitively
affectionate
nature
blinded
by
veils
of
womanly
tenderness
folded
in
habits
of
peace
could
not
see
the
hard
inevitable
necessity
of
the
contest
earnestly
as
she
sympathised
with
its
loyal
and
humane
objects
she
was
not
logical
enough
or
not
firm
enough
to
sympathise
with
the
iron
thing
itself
lapped
in
sweet
influences
of
peace
all
her
loving
life
why
must
she
be
called
to
death
amid
the
clamor
of
murderous
contests
for
her
health
was
failing
a
painful
and
fatal
disease
had
fastened
its
clutches
on
her
another
year
course
she
did
not
hope
to
run
and
if
the
hateful
struggle
must
go
on
if
it
must
torment
her
last
few
days
with
its
agitations
and
horrors
so
much
the
more
did
she
need
her
only
child
other
women
sons
yes
if
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
not
hers
might
put
on
the
panoply
of
strife
and
disappear
from
anxiously
following
eyes
into
the
smoke
and
flame
of
battle
edward
told
her
every
day
the
warlike
news
of
the
journals
the
grand
and
stern
putting
on
of
the
harness
the
gigantic
plans
for
crushing
the
foes
she
could
take
no
interest
in
such
tidings
but
that
of
aversion
he
read
to
her
in
a
voice
which
thrilled
like
swellings
of
martial
music
tennyson
charge
of
the
six
hundred
she
listened
to
the
words
with
distaste
and
almost
with
horror
well
the
summer
wore
away
that
summer
of
sombre
preparation
and
preluding
skirmishes
whose
scattering
musketry
and
thin
cannonade
faintly
prophecied
the
orchestral
thunders
of
gettysburg
and
the
wilderness
and
whose
few
dead
preceded
like
skirmishers
the
massive
columns
which
for
years
should
firmly
follow
them
into
the
dark
valley
its
forereaching
shadows
fell
upon
many
homes
far
away
from
the
battlefield
and
chilled
to
death
many
sensitive
natures
old
persons
and
invalids
sank
into
the
grave
that
season
under
the
oppression
of
its
straining
suspense
and
preliminary
horror
and
among
these
victims
whom
no
man
has
counted
and
whom
few
have
thought
of
collectively
was
the
mother
of
colburne
one
september
afternoon
she
sent
for
edward
the
doctor
had
gone
his
labors
were
over
the
clergyman
had
gone
neither
was
he
longer
needed
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
but
the
nurse
the
dying
mother
and
the
only
child
the
change
had
been
expected
for
days
and
edward
had
thought
that
he
was
prepared
for
it
had
indeed
marvelled
and
been
shocked
at
himself
because
he
could
look
forward
to
it
with
such
seeming
composure
for
reason
with
his
heart
and
his
conscience
as
he
might
he
could
not
feel
a
fitting
dread
and
anguish
in
the
common
phrase
of
humanity
when
numbed
by
unusual
sorrow
he
could
not
realize
it
but
now
as
leaning
over
the
footboard
and
looking
steadfastly
upon
his
mother
face
he
saw
that
the
final
hour
had
come
a
sickness
of
heart
fell
upon
him
and
a
trembling
as
if
his
soul
were
being
torn
asunder
yet
neither
wept
the
puritans
and
the
children
of
the
puritans
do
not
weep
easily
they
are
taught
not
to
utter
but
to
hide
their
emotions
the
nurse
perceived
no
signs
of
unusual
feeling
except
that
the
face
of
the
strong
man
became
suddenly
as
pale
as
that
of
the
dying
woman
and
that
to
him
this
was
an
hour
of
anguish
while
to
her
it
was
one
of
unspeakable
joy
the
mother
knew
her
son
too
well
not
to
see
even
with
those
failing
eyes
into
the
depths
of
his
sorrow
do
be
grieved
for
me
edward
she
said
i
am
sustained
by
the
faith
of
the
promises
i
am
about
to
return
from
the
place
whence
i
came
i
am
with
peace
and
with
confidence
into
a
blessed
eternity
he
came
to
the
side
of
the
bed
sat
down
on
it
and
took
her
hand
without
speaking
you
will
follow
me
some
day
she
went
on
you
will
follow
me
to
the
place
where
i
shall
be
at
the
right
hand
of
the
lord
i
have
prayed
for
it
often
i
was
praying
for
it
a
moment
ago
and
my
child
my
prayer
will
be
granted
oh
i
have
been
so
fearful
for
you
but
i
am
fearful
no
longer
he
made
no
answer
except
to
press
her
hand
while
she
paused
to
draw
a
few
short
and
wearisome
breaths
i
can
bear
to
part
with
you
now
she
resumed
i
could
not
bear
it
till
the
lord
granted
me
this
full
assurance
that
we
shall
meet
again
i
leave
you
in
his
hands
i
make
no
conditions
with
him
i
have
been
sweetly
brought
to
give
you
altogether
up
to
one
who
loves
you
better
than
i
know
how
to
love
you
he
gave
me
my
love
and
he
has
kept
more
than
he
gave
perhaps
i
have
been
selfish
edward
to
hold
on
to
you
as
i
have
you
have
felt
it
your
duty
to
go
into
the
army
and
perhaps
i
have
been
selfish
to
prevent
you
now
you
are
free
i
shall
not
be
here
if
you
still
see
that
to
be
your
duty
go
and
the
lord
go
with
you
darling
and
give
you
strength
and
courage
i
do
not
ask
him
to
spare
you
but
only
to
guide
you
here
below
and
restore
you
to
me
and
he
will
do
it
edward
for
his
own
sake
i
am
full
of
confidence
the
promises
are
sure
for
you
and
for
myself
i
rejoice
with
a
joy
unspeakable
and
full
of
glory
while
thus
speaking
or
rather
whispering
she
had
put
one
arm
around
his
neck
as
he
kissed
her
wasted
cheek
and
let
fall
his
first
tears
on
it
she
drew
her
hand
across
his
face
with
a
caressing
tenderness
and
smiling
fell
back
softly
on
her
pillow
closing
her
eyes
as
calmly
as
if
to
sleep
a
few
broken
words
a
murmuring
of
unutterable
unearthly
infinite
happiness
echoes
as
it
were
of
greetings
far
away
with
welcoming
angels
were
her
last
utterances
to
the
young
man
who
still
held
her
hand
and
now
and
then
kissed
her
cheek
she
seemed
to
slumber
although
her
breathing
gradually
sank
so
low
that
he
could
not
perceive
it
but
after
a
long
time
the
nurse
came
to
the
bedside
bent
over
it
looked
listened
and
said
she
is
gone
he
was
free
she
was
not
there
he
went
to
his
room
with
a
horrible
feeling
that
for
him
there
was
no
more
love
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
and
nothing
to
expect
that
his
life
was
a
blank
he
could
fix
his
mind
on
nothing
past
or
future
not
even
upon
the
unparalleled
sorrow
of
the
present
taking
up
the
bible
which
she
had
given
him
he
read
a
page
before
he
noticed
that
he
had
not
understood
and
did
not
remember
a
single
passage
in
that
vacancy
that
almost
idiocy
which
beclouds
afflicted
souls
he
could
not
recall
a
distinct
impression
of
the
scene
through
which
he
had
just
passed
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
forever
his
mother
dying
words
her
confidence
that
they
should
meet
again
her
heavenly
joy
with
the
same
perverseness
and
in
spite
of
repeated
efforts
to
close
his
ears
to
the
sound
some
inner
wayward
self
repeated
to
him
over
and
over
again
these
verses
of
the
unhappy
poe
thank
heaven
the
crisis
the
danger
is
past
and
the
lingering
illness
is
over
at
last
and
the
fever
called
living
is
conquered
at
last
the
sad
words
sounded
wofully
true
to
him
for
the
time
for
some
days
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
life
were
but
a
wearisome
illness
for
which
the
grave
was
but
a
cure
his
mind
fevered
by
night
watching
anxiety
and
an
unaccustomed
grappling
with
sorrow
was
not
in
a
healthy
state
he
thought
that
he
was
willing
to
die
he
only
desired
to
fall
usefully
honorably
and
in
consonance
with
the
spirit
of
his
generation
he
would
set
his
face
henceforward
towards
the
awful
beacons
of
the
his
resolution
was
taken
with
the
seriousness
of
one
who
though
cheerful
and
even
jovial
by
nature
had
been
permeated
to
some
extent
by
the
solemn
passion
of
puritanism
he
painted
to
himself
in
strong
colors
the
risk
of
death
and
the
nature
of
it
then
deliberately
chose
the
part
of
facing
this
tremendous
mystery
in
support
of
the
right
all
this
while
be
it
remembered
his
mind
was
somewhat
exalted
by
the
fever
of
bodily
weariness
and
of
spiritual
sorrow
chapter

captain

raises
a
company
and
colonel
carter
a
regiment
the
settlement
of
his
mother
estate
and
of
his
own
pecuniary
affairs
occupied
colburne
time
until
the
early
part
of
october
by
then
he
had
invested
his
property
as
well
as
might
be
rented
the
old
homestead
taken
a
room
in
the
new
boston
house
and
was
fully
prepared
to
bid
to
native
soil
and
if
need
be
to
life
miss
ravenel
was
a
strong
though
silent
temptation
to
remain
and
to
exist
but
he
resisted
her
with
the
heroism
which
he
subsequently
exhibited
in
combating
male
rebels
one
morning
as
he
left
the
hotel
rather
later
than
usual
to
go
to
his
office
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
face
and
gigantic
brown
mustache
which
he
could
not
have
failed
to
recognize
no
matter
where
nor
when
encountered
there
was
the
wounded
captive
of
bull
run
as
big
chested
and
rich
complexioned
as
audacious
in
eye
and
haughty
in
air
as
if
no
hurt
nor
hardship
nor
calamity
had
ever
befallen
him
he
checked
colburne
eager
advance
with
a
cold
stare
and
passed
him
without
speaking
but
the
young
fellow
hardly
had
time
to
color
at
this
rebuff
when
just
as
he
was
opening
the
outer
door
a
baritone
voice
arrested
him
with
a
ringing
look
here
beg
pardon
continued
the
coming
up
hastily
did
recognize
you
it
quite
a
time
since
our
you
know
here
he
showed
a
broad
grin
and
presently
burst
out
laughing
as
much
amused
at
the
past
as
if
it
did
not
contain
bull
run
what
a
jolly
old
that
was
he
went
on
i
have
shouted
a
hundred
times
to
think
of
myself
passing
the
wine
and
segars
to
those
prim
old
virgins
just
as
though
i
had
bowsed
into
the
house
beautiful
among
bunyan
damsels
and
offered
to
treat
the
crowd
again
the
laughed
noisily
his
insolent
black
eyes
twinkling
with
merriment
colburne
looked
at
him
and
listened
to
him
with
amazement
here
was
a
man
who
had
lately
been
in
what
was
to
him
the
terrible
mystery
of
battle
who
had
fallen
down
wounded
and
been
carried
away
captive
while
fighting
heroically
for
the
noblest
of
causes
who
had
witnessed
the
greatest
and
most
humiliating
overthrow
which
ever
befel
the
armies
of
the
republic
who
yet
did
not
allude
to
any
of
these
things
nor
apparently
think
of
them
but
could
chat
and
laugh
about
a
was
it
treasonable
indifference
or
levity
or
the
sublimity
of
modesty
colburne
thought
that
if
had
been
at
bull
run
he
never
could
have
talked
of
any
thing
else
well
how
are
you
demanded
carter
you
are
looking
a
little
pale
and
thin
it
seems
to
me
oh
i
am
well
enough
answered
colburne
passing
over
that
subject
with
modest
contempt
as
not
worthy
of
mention
but
how
are
have
you
recovered
from
your
wound
wound
oh
yes
mere
bagatelle
healed
up
some
time
ago
i
have
been
caught
if
i
had
been
stunned
by
my
horse
falling
the
wound
was
nothing
but
you
must
have
suffered
in
your
confinement
said
colburne
determined
to
appreciate
and
pity
suffered
my
dear
fellow
i
suffered
with
eating
and
drinking
and
making
merry
i
had
the
deuce
own
time
in
richmond
i
met
loads
of
my
old
comrades
and
they
nearly
killed
me
with
kindness
they
are
a
nice
set
of
old
boys
if
they
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
fence
you
suppose
they
would
maltreat
a
brother
west
pointer
did
you
and
the
laughed
heartily
at
the
civilian
blunder
i
did
know
really
answered
the
puzzled
colburne
i
must
say
i
thought
so
but
i
am
as
poor
a
judge
of
soldiers
as
a
sheep
is
of
catamounts
why
look
here
when
i
left
they
gave
me
a
supper
and
not
only
made
me
drunk
but
got
drunk
themselves
in
my
honor
opened
their
purses
too
and
forced
their
money
on
me
all
this
it
will
be
noted
was
long
previous
to
the
time
when
libby
prison
and
andersonville
were
deliberately
converted
into
and
starvation
pens
i
am
afraid
they
wanted
to
bring
you
over
observed
colburne
he
looked
not
only
suspicious
but
even
a
little
anxious
for
in
those
days
every
patriot
feared
for
the
faith
of
his
neighbor
i
suppose
they
did
replied
carter
carelessly
as
if
he
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
idea
of
course
they
did
they
need
all
the
help
that
they
can
get
in
fact
the
rebel
secretary
of
war
paid
me
the
compliment
of
making
me
an
offer
of
a
regiment
with
an
assurance
that
promotion
might
be
relied
on
it
was
done
so
delicately
that
i
be
offended
in
fact
it
was
quite
natural
and
he
probably
thought
it
would
be
bad
taste
to
omit
it
i
am
a
virginian
you
know
and
then
i
was
once
engaged
in
some
southern
schemes
and
diplomacies
before
this
war
broke
out
you
understand
oh
no
connection
with
this
war
however
i
declined
his
offer
there
a
patriot
for
you
i
honor
you
sir
said
colburne
with
a
fervor
which
made
the
grin
you
ought
to
be
rewarded
quite
so
answered
the
other
in
his
careless
style
well
i
am
rewarded
i
received
a
letter
yesterday
afternoon
from
your
governor
offering
me
a
regiment
i
had
just
finished
an
elegant
dinner
with
some
good
fellows
and
was
going
in
for
a
roaring
evening
but
business
before
pleasure
i
took
a
cold
plunge
bath
and
the
next
train
for
new
boston
getting
here
at
midnight
i
am
off
at
ten
to
see
his
excellency
i
am
sincerely
delighted
exclaimed
the
young
man
i
am
delighted
to
hear
that
the
governor
has
had
such
good
sense
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
added
anxiously
do
you
remember
your
invitation
to
me
certainly
what
do
you
say
to
it
now
will
you
go
with
me
i
will
said
colburne
emphatically
i
will
try
i
only
fear
that
i
can
neither
raise
nor
command
a
company
never
fear
answered
carter
in
a
tone
which
at
doubt
you
are
just
the
man
come
round
to
the
bar
with
me
and
let
drink
success
to
our
regiment
oh
i
recollect
you
do
imbibe
smoke
a
segar
then
while
we
talk
it
over
i
tell
you
that
you
are
just
the
man
any
gentleman
can
make
a
good
enough
company
officer
in
three
months
practice
as
to
raising
your
men
i
give
you
my
best
countenance
whatever
that
may
amount
to
and
if
you
actually
succeed
in
getting
your
quota
after
all
why
we
take
somebody
else
men
examinations
of
officers
and
consolidations
of
companies
bring
all
these
things
right
you
know
i
should
be
sorry
to
profit
by
any
other
man
influence
and
energy
to
his
harm
answered
the
fastidious
colburne
pshaw
it
all
for
the
good
of
the
service
and
of
the
country
because
a
low
fellow
who
keeps
a
saloon
can
treat
and
wheedle
sixty
or
eighty
stout
fellows
into
the
ranks
do
you
suppose
that
he
ought
to
be
commissioned
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
i
do
it
ca
be
in
my
regiment
leave
those
things
to
me
and
go
to
work
without
fear
write
to
the
of
the
state
for
a
recruiting
commission
and
as
soon
as
you
get
it
open
an
office
i
guarantee
that
you
shall
be
one
of
the
captains
of
the
tenth
barataria
who
are
the
other
field
officers
asked
colburne
not
appointed
yet
i
am
alone
in
my
glory
i
am
the
regiment
but
the
and
major
shall
be
of
the
right
stamp
i
mean
to
have
a
word
to
say
as
to
the
choice
i
tell
you
that
we
have
the
bulliest
regiment
that
ever
sprang
from
the
soil
of
new
england
well
i
try
but
i
really
fear
that
i
shall
just
get
my
company
recruited
in
time
for
the
next
war
never
fear
laughed
carter
as
though
war
were
a
huge
practical
joke
we
are
in
for
a
four
or
five
years
job
of
fighting
you
do
mean
it
said
the
young
man
in
amazement
why
we
citizens
are
all
so
full
of
confidence
mcclellan
every
body
says
is
organizing
a
splendid
army
did
bull
run
give
you
such
an
opinion
of
the
superior
fighting
qualities
of
the
southerners
not
at
all
both
sides
fought
timidly
as
a
rule
just
as
greenhorns
naturally
would
do
the
best
description
of
the
battle
that
i
have
heard
was
given
in
a
single
sentence
by
my
old
captain
lamar
now
in
command
of
a
georgia
regiment
said
he
never
was
a
more
frightened
set
than
our
fellows
except
your
why
we
outfought
them
in
the
morning
we
had
them
fairly
whipped
until
johnston
came
up
on
our
right
the
retreat
was
a
mathematical
necessity
it
was
like
saying
two
and
two
make
four
when
our
line
was
turned
of
course
it
had
to
retreat
retreat
groaned
colburne
in
bitterness
over
the
recollection
of
that
calamitous
afternoon
but
you
did
see
it
they
ran
shamefully
and
never
stopped
short
of
washington
one
man
reached
new
boston
inside
of
hours
it
was
a
panic
unparalleled
in
history
nonsense
beg
your
pardon
did
you
never
read
of
austerlitz
and
jena
and
waterloo
our
men
did
pretty
well
for
militia
i
did
see
the
panic
to
be
sure
i
was
picked
up
before
that
happened
but
i
have
talked
with
some
of
our
officers
who
did
see
it
and
they
told
me
that
the
papers
exaggerated
it
absurdly
newspaper
correspondents
ought
not
to
be
allowed
in
the
army
they
exaggerate
every
thing
if
we
had
gained
a
victory
they
would
have
made
it
out
something
greater
than
waterloo
you
must
consider
how
easily
inexperience
is
deceived
just
get
the
story
of
an
upset
from
an
old
and
then
from
a
lady
passenger
the
first
will
tell
it
as
quite
an
ordinary
affair
and
the
second
will
make
it
out
a
tragedy
now
when
some
old
grannies
of
congressmen
and
some
young
ladies
of
newspaper
reporters
none
of
whom
had
ever
seen
either
a
victory
or
a
defeat
before
got
entangled
among
half
a
dozen
disordered
regiments
they
naturally
concluded
that
nothing
like
it
had
happened
in
history
i
tell
you
that
it
was
unparalleled
and
that
it
ought
not
to
have
been
considered
surprising
whichever
of
those
two
green
armies
got
repulsed
was
pretty
sure
to
be
routed
that
was
a
very
pretty
manoeuvre
though
that
coming
up
of
johnston
on
our
right
patterson
ought
to
be
for
his
stupidity
stupidity
he
is
a
traitor
exclaimed
colburne
oh
oh
expostulated
the
colonel
with
a
cough
if
we
are
to
try
all
our
dull
old
gentlemen
as
traitors
we
shall
have
our
hands
full
something
like
hanging
homely
old
women
for
by
the
way
how
are
the
allstons
i
mean
the
the
ravenels
well
are
they
young
lady
as
blooming
and
blushing
as
ever
glad
to
hear
it
ca
stop
to
call
on
them
my
train
goes
in
ten
i
am
delighted
that
you
are
going
to
fall
in
with
me
good
bye
for
away
he
went
leaving
colburne
in
wonder
over
his
contrasts
of
slanginess
and
gentility
his
mingled
audacity
and
of
character
and
all
the
picturesque
ins
and
outs
of
his
moral
architecture
so
different
from
the
severe
plainness
of
the
spiritual
temples
common
in
new
boston
the
young
man
would
have
preferred
that
his
future
colonel
should
not
drink
and
swear
but
he
would
not
puritanically
decide
that
a
man
who
drank
and
swore
could
not
be
a
good
officer
he
did
not
know
army
men
well
enough
to
dare
judge
them
with
positiveness
and
he
certainly
would
not
try
them
by
the
moral
standards
according
to
which
he
tried
civilians
the
facts
that
carter
was
a
professional
soldier
and
that
he
had
shed
his
blood
in
the
cause
of
the
country
were
sufficient
to
make
colburne
regard
with
charity
all
his
frank
vices
i
must
not
allow
the
reader
to
suppose
that
i
present
carter
as
a
type
of
all
regular
officers
there
were
men
in
the
old
army
who
never
tasted
liquors
who
never
blasphemed
who
did
not
waste
their
substance
in
riotous
living
who
could
be
accused
of
no
evil
practices
who
were
models
of
christian
gentlemen
the
american
service
as
well
as
the
english
had
its
havelocks
its
headly
vicars
its
colonel
newcomes
nevertheless
i
do
venture
to
say
that
it
had
also
a
great
many
men
whose
moral
habits
were
cut
more
or
less
on
the
carter
pattern
who
swore
after
the
fashion
of
the
british
army
in
flanders
whose
heads
could
carry
drink
like
dugald
dalgetty
and
who
had
even
other
vices
concerning
which
my
discreet
pen
is
silent
within
a
week
after
the
conversation
above
reported
colburne
opened
a
recruiting
office
advertised
the
putnam
rangers
largely
and
adorned
his
doorway
with
a
transparency
representing
old
put
in
a
uniform
riding
sword
in
hand
down
the
stone
steps
of
his
company
as
yet
in
embryo
was
one
of
the
ten
accepted
out
of
the
nineteen
offered
for
carter
regiment
it
was
supposed
that
the
name
of
a
west
point
colonel
would
render
the
organization
a
favorite
one
with
the
enlisting
classes
and
accordingly
all
the
chiefs
of
incomplete
companies
throughout
the
state
of
barataria
wanted
to
seize
the
chance
for
easy
recruiting
but
colburne
soon
found
that
the
dullness
of
a
young
lawyer
office
was
none
too
prosy
an
exordium
for
the
dullness
of
a
recruiting
office
at
this
particular
period
passed
was
that
springtide
of
popular
enthusiasm
when
companies
were
raised
in
a
day
when
undersized
heroes
wept
at
being
rejected
by
the
mustering
officer
when
youths
paid
a
hundred
dollars
to
buy
out
a
chance
to
be
shot
at
bull
run
had
disenchanted
some
romantic
natures
concerning
the
pleasures
of
war
and
the
vast
enlistments
of
the
summer
had
drawn
heavily
on
the
nation
fighting
material
moreover
colburne
had
to
encounter
obstacles
of
a
personal
nature
such
as
did
not
trouble
some
of
his
competitors
a
student
a
member
of
a
small
and
shy
social
circle
neither
business
man
nor
one
of
the
bone
and
sinew
not
having
belonged
to
a
fire
company
or
militia
company
nor
even
kept
a
bar
or
he
had
no
retainers
nor
partisans
nor
shopmates
to
call
upon
no
rummy
customers
whom
he
could
engage
in
the
on
condition
of
unlimited
whiskey
he
had
absolutely
no
personal
means
of
influencing
the
classes
of
the
community
which
furnish
that
important
element
of
all
military
organizations
private
soldiers
for
a
time
he
remained
almost
as
solitary
in
his
office
as
old
put
in
the
perilous
glory
of
his
breakneck
descent
in
short
the
raising
of
his
company
proved
a
slow
vexatious
and
expensive
business
notwithstanding
the
countenance
and
aid
of
the
colonel
miss
ravenel
was
much
spited
in
secret
when
she
saw
his
advertisement
but
she
was
too
proud
to
expose
her
interest
in
the
matter
by
opposition
what
object
had
she
in
keeping
him
at
home
and
out
of
danger
moreover
after
the
fashion
of
most
southern
women
she
believed
in
fighting
and
respected
a
man
the
more
for
drawing
the
sword
no
matter
for
which
party
after
a
while
when
his
activity
and
cheerfulness
of
spirit
had
returned
to
him
she
began
to
talk
with
her
old
freedom
of
expression
and
indulged
in
playful
prophecies
about
the
bull
runs
he
would
fight
the
masterly
retreats
he
would
accomplish
and
the
captivities
he
would
undergo
when
you
are
a
prisoner
in
richmond
she
said
i
write
to
my
louisiana
friends
in
the
southern
army
and
tell
them
what
a
spiteful
abolitionist
you
are
i
get
them
to
put
a
colored
friend
and
brother
into
the
same
cell
with
you
you
wo
like
it
you
promise
to
go
back
to
your
law
office
if
they
send
that
fellow
to
his
plantation
the
doctor
was
all
sympathy
and
interest
and
brimmed
over
with
prophecies
of
colburne
success
he
judged
the
people
of
barataria
by
the
people
of
louisiana
the
latter
preferred
gentlemen
for
officers
and
so
of
course
would
the
former
notwithstanding
his
hatred
of
slavery
he
was
still
somewhat
under
the
influence
of
its
aristocratical
glamour
he
had
not
yet
fully
comprehended
that
the
war
was
a
struggle
of
the
plain
people
against
an
oligarchy
and
that
the
plain
people
had
not
very
understandingly
but
still
very
resolutely
determined
to
lead
the
fighting
as
well
as
to
do
it
he
had
not
yet
full
faith
that
the
northern
would
beat
the
southern
gentleman
without
much
guidance
from
the
northern
scholar
do
be
discouraged
he
said
to
colburne
i
feel
the
utmost
confidence
in
your
prospects
as
soon
as
it
is
generally
understood
who
you
are
and
what
your
character
is
you
will
have
recruits
to
give
away
it
is
impossible
that
these
and
tinkers
should
raise
good
men
as
easily
as
a
gentleman
and
a
graduate
of
the
university
they
may
get
a
run
of
but
it
wo
last
i
predict
that
your
company
will
be
completed
sooner
and
composed
of
better
material
than
any
other
in
the
regiment
i
would
no
more
give
your
chance
for
that
of
one
of
these
tinkers
than
i
would
exchange
a
meteorite
for
its
weight
in
old
nails
the
doctor
abounded
in
promising
but
unfruitful
schemes
for
helping
forward
the
putnam
rangers
he
proposed
that
colburne
should
send
a
circular
to
all
the
clergymen
and
superintendents
of
the
county
calling
upon
each
parish
to
furnish
the
subscriber
with
only
one
good
recruit
if
they
do
that
said
he
as
they
unquestionably
will
when
the
case
is
properly
presented
to
them
why
the
company
is
filled
at
once
he
advised
the
young
man
to
make
an
oratorical
tour
delivering
patriotic
speeches
in
the
village
lyceums
and
circulating
an
enlistment
paper
at
the
close
of
each
performance
he
told
him
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
move
to
apply
to
his
professional
brethren
far
and
near
for
aid
in
rousing
the
popular
enthusiasm
he
himself
wrote
favorable
notices
of
the
captain
and
his
company
and
got
them
printed
in
the
city
journals
one
day
he
came
home
in
a
hurry
and
with
great
glee
produced
the
evening
edition
of
the
new
boston
patriot
our
young
friend
has
hit
it
at
last
he
said
to
lillie
he
has
called
the
muses
to
his
aid
here
is
a
superb
patriotic
hymn
of
his
composition
it
is
the
best
thing
of
the
kind
that
the
literature
of
the
war
has
produced
the
doctor
was
somewhat
given
to
hyperbole
in
speaking
well
of
his
friends
it
ca
fail
to
excite
popular
attention
i
venture
to
predict
that
those
verses
alone
will
bring
him
in
fifty
men
let
me
see
said
lillie
making
an
impatient
snatch
at
the
paper
but
the
doctor
drew
it
away
desirous
of
enjoying
the
luxury
of
his
own
elocution
to
read
a
good
thing
aloud
and
to
poke
the
fire
are
simple
but
real
pleasures
which
some
people
can
not
easily
deny
themselves
and
which
belong
of
right
i
think
to
the
head
of
a
family
the
doctor
settled
himself
in
an
easy
chair
adjusted
his
collar
put
up
his
eyeglass
dropped
it
put
on
his
spectacles
in
spite
of
remonstrances
and
read
as
follows
a
national
hymn
america
be
thou
our
country
chief
in
this
our
year
of
grief
allfather
great
go
forth
with
awful
tread
crush
treason
serpent
head
bring
back
our
sons
misled
and
save
our
state
uphold
our
stripes
and
stars
through

destroying
jars
with
thy
right
hand
oh
god
of
battles
lead
where
our
swift
navies
speed
where
our
brave
armies
bleed
for
fatherland
break
every
yoke
and
chain
let
truth
and
justice
reign
from
sea
to
sea
make
all
our
statutes
right
in
thy
most
holy
sight

us
o
lord
of
light
to
follow
thee
god
bless
our
fatherland

it

and
grand
on

and
shore
ages
its
glory
swell
peace
in
its
borders
dwell
god
stand
its
sentinel
for
ever
more
let
me
see
it
persisted
lillie
making
a
second
and
more
successful
reach
for
the
paper
she
read
the
verses
to
herself
with
a
slight
flush
of
excitement
and
then
quietly
remarked
that
they
were
pretty
it
has
been
suspected
that
she
kept
that
paper
at
all
events
when
her
father
sought
it
next
morning
to
cut
out
the
verses
and
paste
them
in
his
book
he
could
not
find
it
and
while
lillie
pretended
to
take
an
interest
in
his
search
she
made
no
distinct
answer
to
his
inquiries
i
am
told
by
persons
wise
in
the
ways
of
young
ladies
that
they
sometimes
lay
aside
trifles
of
this
sort
and
are
afterwards
ashamed
from
some
inexplicable
cause
of
having
the
fact
become
patent
even
to
their
nearest
relatives
it
must
not
be
understood
by
the
way
that
miss
ravenel
had
lost
her
slight
admiration
for
that
specimen
of
the
male
sex
colonel
carter
he
was
too
much
in
the
style
of
a
louisiana
planter
not
to
be
attractive
to
her
homesick
eyes
she
welcomed
his
rare
visits
with
her
invariable
but
nevertheless
flattering
blush
and
talked
to
him
with
a
vivacity
which
sent
flashes
of
pain
into
the
soul
of
colburne
the
young
man
admitted
the
fact
of
these
spasms
but
tried
to
keep
up
a
deception
as
to
their
cause
in
his
charity
towards
himself
he
attributed
them
to
an
unselfish
anxiety
for
the
happiness
of
that
sweet
girl
who
he
feared
would
find
carter
an
unsuitable
husband
however
grandiose
as
a
social
ornament
and
accomplished
as
an
officer
in
spite
of
these
sentimental
possibilities
of
disagreement
between
the
colonel
and
the
captain
their
friendship
daily
grew
stronger
the
former
was
not
in
the
least
influenced
by
lovelorn
jealousy
and
set
much
store
by
colburne
as
being
the
only
officer
in
his
regiment
who
was
precisely
to
his
taste
he
had
desired
but
had
not
been
able
to
obtain
the
young
gentlemen
of
new
boston
the
sons
of
the
college
professors
and
of
the
city
clergymen
the
set
was
limited
in
number
and
not
martial
nor
enthusiastic
in
character
it
had
held
aristocratically
aloof
from
the
militia
from
the
fire
companies
from
personal
interference
in
local
politics
from
every
social
enterprise
which
could
bring
it
into
contact
with
the
laboring
masses
it
needed
two
years
of
tremendous
war
to
break
through
the
shy
reserve
of
this
secluded
and
almost
monastic
little
circle
and
let
loose
its
sons
upon
the
battlefield
the
colonel
was
disgusted
with
his
raft
of
tinkers
and
tailors
as
he
called
his
officers
although
they
were
mostly
good
and
creditably
zealous
in
learning
the
graver
duties
of
their
new
profession
the
regular
army
he
said
had
not
been
troubled
with
any
such
kind
of
fellows
the
brahminism
of
west
point
and
of
the
old
service
revolted
from
such
vulgar
associations
it
required
the
fiery
breath
of
many
fierce
battles
in
which
the
gallantry
of
volunteers
shone
conspicuous
to
blow
this
feeling
into
oblivion
one
day
the
colonel
related
in
confidence
to
the
doctor
a
circumstance
which
had
given
him
peculiar
disgust
the
governor
having
permitted
him
to
nominate
his
own
he
had
selected
an
of
a
three
months
regiment
who
had
shown
tactical
knowledge
and
gallantry
the
field
position
of
major
he
had
finally
resolved
to
demand
for
colburne
hence
an
interview
and
an
unpleasant
one
with
the
chief
magistrate
of
barataria
governor
said
carter
i
want
that
majority
for
a
particular
friend
of
mine
the
best
officer
in
the
regiment
and
the
best
man
for
the
place
that
i
know
in
the
state
the
governor
was
in
his
little
office
reclining
in
a
oaken
chair
and
toasting
his
feet
at
a
fire
he
was
a
tall
thin
stooping
gentleman
slow
in
gait
because
feeble
in
health
with
a
benign
dignity
of
manner
and
an
unvarying
amiability
of
countenance
his
eyes
were
a
pale
blue
his
hair
a
light
chestnut
slightly
silvered
by
fifty
years
his
complexion
had
once
been
freckled
and
was
still
fair
his
smile
was
frequent
and
conciliatory
like
president
lincoln
he
sprang
from
the
plain
people
who
were
to
conquer
in
this
war
and
like
him
he
was
capable
of
intellectual
and
moral
growth
in
proportion
to
enlargement
of
his
sphere
of
action
a
modest
obliging
man
patriotic
in
every
impulse
devout
in
the
severe
piety
of
new
england
distinguished
for
personal
honor
and
private
virtues
he
was
in
the
main
a
credit
to
the
state
which
had
selected
him
for
its
loftiest
dignity
he
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
saluted
the
colonel
with
marked
respect
although
he
did
not
like
his
moral
ways
he
valued
him
highly
for
his
professional
ability
and
courage
and
was
proud
to
have
him
in
command
of
a
baratarian
regiment
to
his
shy
spirit
this
aristocratic
and
martial
personage
was
in
fact
a
rather
imposing
phenomenon
carter
had
a
fearful
eye
by
turns
audaciously
haughty
and
insolently
quizzical
and
on
this
occasion
the
governor
felt
himself
more
than
usually
discomposed
under
its
wide
open
steady
confident
stare
he
seemed
even
a
little
tremulous
as
he
took
his
seat
he
dreaded
to
disagree
with
the
representative
of
west
point
brahminism
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
must
captain
colburne
oh
captain
colburne
hesitated
the
governor
i
agree
with
you
colonel
in
all
that
you
say
of
him
i
hope
that
there
will
be
an
opportunity
yet
of
pushing
him
forward
but
just
now
he
continued
with
a
smile
that
was
apologetical
and
almost
penitent
i
do
see
that
i
can
give
him
the
majority
i
have
promised
it
to
captain
gazaway
to
gazaway
exclaimed
carter
a
long
breath
of
angry
astonishment
swelled
his
broad
breast
and
his
cheek
would
have
flushed
if
any
emotion
could
have
deepened
the
tint
of
that
dark
red
bronze
you
do
mean
i
hope
governor
that
you
are
resolved
to
give
the
majority
of
my
regiment
to
that
boor
i
know
that
he
is
a
plain
man
mildly
answered
the
governor
who
had
begun
life
himself
as
a
mechanic
plain
man
he
is
a
plain
blackguard
he
is
a
and
the
governor
uttered
a
little
troubled
laugh
he
was
clearly
discomposed
but
he
was
not
angry
i
am
willing
to
grant
all
that
you
say
of
him
he
answered
i
have
no
personal
liking
for
the
man
individually
i
should
prefer
captain
colburne
but
if
you
knew
the
pressure
that
i
am
under
he
hesitated
as
if
reflecting
smiled
again
with
his
habitual
gentleness
folded
and
unfolded
his
hands
nervously
and
proceeded
with
his
explanation
you
must
not
expose
our
little
political
secrets
colonel
i
am
obliged
to
permit
certain
schemes
and
plots
which
personally
i
disapprove
of
captain
gazaway
lives
in
a
very
close
district
and
influences
a
considerable
number
of
votes
he
is
popular
among
his
class
of
people
as
you
can
see
by
the
ease
with
which
he
filled
his
company
he
and
his
friends
insist
upon
the
majority
if
we
refuse
it
we
shall
probably
lose
the
district
and
a
member
of
congress
that
is
a
serious
matter
at
this
time
when
the
administration
must
be
supported
by
a
strong
house
or
the
nation
may
be
shipwrecked
still
if
i
were
left
alone
i
would
take
the
risk
and
appoint
good
officers
and
no
others
to
all
our
regiments
satisfied
that
success
in
the
field
is
the
best
means
of
holding
the
masses
firm
in
support
of
the
government
but
in
the
meantime
burleigh
who
is
our
candidate
in
gazaway
district
is
defeated
we
will
suppose
burleigh
and
gazaway
understand
each
other
if
gazaway
gets
the
majority
he
promises
to
insure
the
district
to
burleigh
you
see
the
pressure
i
am
under
all
the
leading
managers
of
our
party
concur
in
urging
upon
me
this
promotion
of
gazaway
i
regret
extremely
that
i
can
do
nothing
now
for
your
favorite
whom
i
respect
very
much
i
hope
to
do
something
for
him
in
the
future
when
an
election
is
not
so
near
at
hand
suggested
carter
here
continued
the
governor
without
noticing
the
satire
i
have
been
perfectly
frank
with
you
all
i
ask
in
return
is
that
you
will
have
patience
my
honor
i
ca
of
course
find
fault
with
you
personally
governor
replied
the
colonel
i
see
how
the
cursed
thing
works
you
are
on
a
treadmill
and
must
keep
stepping
according
to
the
machinery
but
by
sir
i
wish
this
whole
matter
of
appointments
was
in
the
hands
of
the
war
department
i
almost
wish
it
was
sighed
the
governor
still
without
a
show
of
wounded
pride
or
impatience
it
was
this
conversation
which
the
colonel
repeated
to
the
scandalized
ears
of
doctor
ravenel
when
the
latter
urged
the
promotion
of
colburne
i
hope
you
will
inform
our
young
friend
of
your
efforts
in
his
favor
said
the
doctor
he
will
be
exceedingly
gratified
notwithstanding
the
disappointment
no
said
the
colonel
i
beg
your
pardon
but
do
tell
him
it
would
not
be
policy
it
would
not
be
soldierly
to
inform
him
of
any
thing
likely
to
disgust
him
with
the
service
chapter
viii
the
brave
bid
to
the
fair
another
circumstance
disgusted
colonel
carter
even
more
than
the
affair
of
the
majority
he
received
a
communication
from
the
war
department
assigning
his
regiment
to
the
new
england
division
and
directing
him
to
report
for
orders
to
benjamin
butler
over
this
paper
he
fired
off
such
a
volley
of
oaths
as
if
uncle
toby
celebrated
army
in
flanders
had
fallen
in
for
practice
in
battalion
swearing
a
civilian
a
lawyer
a
political
a
militiaman
exclaimed
the
southern
gentleman
west
point
graduate
and
of
the
regular
army
what
does
such
a
fellow
know
about
the
organization
or
the
command
of
troops
i
do
believe
he
could
make
out
the
property
returns
of
a
company
or
take
a
platoon
of
skirmishers
into
action
and
i
must
report
to
him
instead
of
he
to
me
let
us
suppose
that
some
inconceivably
great
power
had
suddenly
created
the
colonel
a
lawyer
and
ordered
the
celebrated
massachusetts
advocate
to
act
under
him
as
junior
counsel
we
may
conjecture
that
the
latter
might
have
been
made
somewhat
indignant
by
such
an
arrangement
i
make
official
application
to
be
transferred
to
some
other
command
continued
carter
thinking
to
himself
if
that
wo
answer
i
go
to
the
secretary
myself
about
it
irregular
as
personal
application
may
be
and
if
that
wo
answer
i
be
so
long
in
getting
ready
for
the
field
that
our
pettifogger
will
probably
go
without
me
if
carter
attempted
to
carry
out
any
of
these
plans
he
no
doubt
discovered
that
the
civilian
general
was
greater
than
the
west
point
colonel
in
the
eyes
of
the
authorities
at
washington
but
it
is
probable
that
old
habits
of
soldierly
obedience
prevented
him
from
offering
much
if
any
resistance
to
the
will
of
the
war
department
just
as
it
prevented
him
from
expressing
his
dissatisfaction
in
the
presence
of
any
of
his
subordinate
officers
it
is
true
that
the
tenth
was
an
unconscionable
long
time
in
getting
ready
for
the
field
but
that
was
owing
to
the
decay
of
the
enlisting
spirit
in
barataria
and
carter
seemed
to
be
as
much
fretted
by
the
lack
of
men
as
any
body
meantime
not
even
colburne
the
officer
to
whom
he
unbosomed
himself
the
most
freely
overheard
a
syllable
from
him
in
disparagement
of
general
butler
during
the
leisurely
organization
and
drilling
of
his
regiment
the
colonel
saw
miss
ravenel
often
enough
to
fall
desperately
in
love
with
her
had
he
been
so
minded
he
was
not
so
minded
he
liked
to
talk
with
pretty
young
ladies
to
flirt
with
them
and
to
tease
them
but
he
did
not
easily
take
sentiment
grand
and
a
certain
indifference
to
the
feelings
of
others
combined
with
a
love
of
fun
made
him
a
habitual
quiz
he
acknowledged
the
charm
of
lillie
outlines
and
manner
but
he
treated
her
like
a
child
whom
he
could
pet
and
banter
at
his
pleasure
she
on
the
other
hand
was
a
little
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
quiz
in
return
she
could
not
treat
this
mature
and
seemingly
man
with
the
playful
impertinence
which
sometimes
marked
her
manner
towards
colburne
miss
ravenel
have
you
any
messages
for
new
orleans
said
the
colonel
i
begin
to
think
that
we
shall
go
just
there
it
will
be
such
a
rich
pocket
for
general
butler
fingers
in
speaking
to
civilians
carter
was
not
always
so
careful
of
the
character
of
his
superiors
as
in
talking
to
his
subordinate
officers
just
think
of
the
twelve
millions
of
gold
in
the
banks
he
proceeded
and
the
sugar
and
cotton
too
and
the
wholesale
that
we
can
do
to
varnish
over
our
robberies
it
grieves
me
to
death
to
think
that
the
tenth
will
soon
be
up
and
down
new
orleans
we
shall
make
such
an
awful
slaughter
among
your
crowds
of
old
admirers
i
hope
you
wo
kill
them
all
oh
i
sha
kill
them
all
i
am
not
going
to
commit
suicide
said
the
colonel
with
a
flippant
gallantry
which
made
the
young
lady
color
with
a
suspicion
that
she
was
not
profoundly
appreciated
do
you
really
think
that
you
are
going
to
new
orleans
she
presently
inquired
ah
do
ask
me
you
have
a
right
to
command
me
but
do
i
beg
of
you
order
me
to
tell
state
secrets
then
why
do
you
introduce
the
subject
she
replied
more
annoyed
by
his
manner
than
by
what
he
said
because
the
subject
has
irresistible
charms
because
it
is
connected
with
your
past
and
perhaps
with
your
future
now
if
carter
had
looked
in
the
least
as
he
spoke
i
fear
that
miss
lillie
would
have
been
flattered
and
gratified
but
he
did
not
he
had
a
quizzing
smile
on
his
audacious
face
he
seemed
to
be
talking
to
her
as
he
would
to
a
child
of
fourteen
being
a
woman
of
eighteen
and
sensitive
she
was
not
pleased
by
his
confident
familiarity
and
in
her
inexperience
she
showed
her
annoyance
perhaps
a
little
more
plainly
than
was
quite
dignified
after
watching
her
for
a
moment
or
two
with
his
unwinking
eyes
he
suddenly
changed
his
tone
and
addressed
her
with
an
air
of
entirely
satisfactory
respect
the
truth
is
that
he
could
not
help
being
at
times
to
young
ladies
but
then
he
had
delicacy
of
breeding
enough
to
know
when
he
was
so
he
did
not
quiz
them
in
mere
boorish
stupidity
i
should
be
truly
delighted
he
said
i
should
consider
it
one
of
the
greatest
honors
possible
to
me
if
i
could
do
something
towards
opening
your
way
back
to
your
own
home
oh
i
wish
you
could
she
replied
with
enthusiasm
i
do
so
want
to
get
back
to
louisiana
but
i
do
want
the
south
whipped
i
want
peace
do
you
that
is
a
bad
wish
for
me
observed
carter
with
his
characteristic
frankness
coolly
wondering
to
himself
how
he
would
be
able
to
live
without
his
colonelcy
as
to
how
he
could
pay
the
thousand
or
two
which
he
owed
to
tailors
shoemakers
restaurateurs
and
wine
merchants
that
was
never
to
him
a
matter
of
marvel
or
of
anxiety
or
even
of
consideration
in
obedience
to
a
curious
instinct
which
exists
in
at
least
some
feminine
natures
miss
ravenel
liked
the
colonel
or
at
least
felt
that
she
could
like
him
just
in
proportion
as
she
feared
him
a
man
who
can
make
some
women
tremble
can
if
he
chooses
make
them
love
pure
and
modest
as
this
girl
of
eighteen
was
she
could
and
i
fear
would
have
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
this
toughened
worldling
had
he
with
his
despotic
temperament
resolutely
willed
it
in
justice
to
her
it
must
be
remembered
that
she
knew
little
or
nothing
about
his
various
naughty
ways
in
her
presence
he
never
swore
nor
got
the
worse
for
liquor
nor
alluded
to
scenes
of
dissipation
at
church
he
decorously
put
down
his
head
while
one
could
count
twenty
and
made
the
responses
with
a
politeness
meant
to
be
complimentary
to
the
parties
addressed
her
father
hinted
but
she
thought
him
unreasonably
prejudiced
she
made
what
she
considered
the
proper
allowance
for
men
who
wore
uniforms
she
had
very
little
idea
of
the
stupendous
discount
which
would
have
to
be
admitted
before
colonel
carter
could
figure
up
as
an
angel
of
light
or
even
as
a
decently
virtuous
member
of
human
society
she
thought
she
stated
the
whole
subject
fairly
when
she
admitted
that
he
might
be
fast
but
she
had
an
innocently
inadequate
conception
of
the
meaning
which
the
masculine
sex
attaches
to
that
epithet
she
applied
it
to
him
chiefly
because
he
had
the
monumental
the
graceful
audacity
the
free
and
easy
fluency
the
little
ways
the
general
air
of
certain
men
in
new
orleans
who
had
been
pointed
out
to
her
as
fast
and
concerning
whom
there
were
dubious
whisperings
among
elderly
dowagers
but
of
whom
she
actually
knew
little
more
than
that
they
had
good
manners
and
were
favorites
with
most
ladies
she
had
learned
to
consider
the
type
a
satisfactory
one
without
at
all
appreciating
its
moral
signification
that
colonel
carter
had
been
downright
wicked
and
was
still
capable
of
being
so
under
a
moderate
pressure
of
temptation
she
did
not
believe
with
any
realizing
and
saving
faith
balzac
says
that
very
corrupt
people
are
generally
very
agreeable
and
it
may
be
that
this
extraordinary
fact
is
capable
of
a
simple
and
sufficient
explanation
they
are
scared
and
do
not
take
things
seriously
they
do
not
contradict
you
on
this
propriety
and
that
belief
because
they
care
nothing
about
proprieties
and
beliefs
they
love
nothing
hate
nothing
and
are
as
easy
to
wear
as
old
slippers
the
strict
moralist
and
pietest
on
the
other
hand
is
as
hard
and
unyielding
as
a
boot
just
from
the
hands
of
the
maker
you
must
conform
to
his
model
or
he
will
conscientiously
pinch
your
moral
corns
in
a
most
grievous
manner
he
can
not
grant
you
a
without
bursting
his
uppers
and
endangering
his
sole
but
pleasant
as
our
corrupt
friends
are
apt
to
be
you
must
not
trust
your
affections
and
your
happiness
to
them
or
you
may
find
that
you
have
cast
your
pearls
before
the
unclean
these
reflections
are
not
perhaps
of
the
newest
but
they
are
just
as
true
as
when
they
were
first
promulgated
concerning
the
possible
flirtation
to
which
i
have
alluded
doctor
ravenel
was
constantly
ill
at
ease
if
he
found
on
returning
from
a
walk
that
lillie
had
received
a
call
from
the
colonel
during
his
absence
he
was
secretly
worried
and
sometimes
openly
peevish
for
hours
afterward
he
would
break
out
upon
that
sort
of
people
though
always
without
mentioning
names
and
the
absent
carter
would
receive
a
severe
lashing
over
the
back
of
some
gentleman
whom
lillie
had
known
or
heard
of
in
new
orleans
i
do
see
how
i
ever
lived
among
such
a
disreputable
population
he
would
say
i
look
upon
myself
sometimes
as
a
man
who
has
just
come
from
a
year
residence
among
the
wealthy
and
genteel
pirates
of
the
isle
of
pines
i
actually
feel
that
i
have
no
claims
upon
a
decent
society
to
be
received
as
a
respectable
character
if
a
new
boston
man
should
refuse
to
shake
hands
with
me
on
the
ground
that
my
associations
had
not
been
what
they
should
be
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
disagree
with
him
among
that
people
i
used
to
wonder
at
the
patience
of
the
almighty
i
obtained
a
conception
of
his
mercies
such
as
i
could
not
have
obtained
in
a
virtuous
community
just
look
at
that
colonel
mcallister
who
used
to
be
the
brightest
ornament
of
new
orleans
fashion
a
mass
of
corruption
the
immoral
odor
of
him
must
have
been
an
offense
to
the
heavens
i
can
imagine
the
angels
and
glorified
spirits
looking
down
at
him
with
disgust
and
actually
holding
their
noses
like
the
king
in
orcagna
picture
when
he
comes
across
the
dead
body
there
never
was
a
subject
brought
into
our
dissecting
room
so
abominable
to
the
physical
senses
as
that
man
was
to
the
moral
sense
oh
papa
do
implored
miss
lillie
you
talk
most
horridly
when
you
get
started
on
certain
subjects
my
conversation
is
half
pungent
enough
to
do
justice
to
the
perfume
of
the
subject
insisted
the
doctor
when
i
speak
or
try
to
speak
of
that
mcallister
and
of
similar
people
to
be
met
there
and
everywhere
i
am
obliged
to
admit
the
inadequacy
of
language
nothing
but
the
last
trump
can
utter
a
sound
appropriate
to
such
personages
but
colonel
mcallister
is
a
very
respectable
planter
now
papa
said
lillie
respectable
oh
my
child
do
not
persist
in
talking
as
if
you
were
still
in
the
nursery
saint
paul
pascal
wilberforce
could
have
remained
respectable
if
they
had
been
slaveholding
planters
to
colonel
carter
personally
the
doctor
was
perfectly
civil
as
he
was
to
every
one
with
whom
he
was
obliged
to
come
in
contact
including
the
reprobated
mcallister
and
his
similars
even
had
he
been
of
a
combative
disposition
or
been
twice
as
prejudiced
against
carter
as
he
was
he
could
not
have
brought
himself
in
these
days
and
with
his
present
loyal
enthusiasm
to
discourteously
entreat
an
officer
who
wore
the
united
states
uniform
and
who
had
bled
in
the
cause
of
country
against
treason
moreover
he
felt
a
certain
degree
of
towards
our
military
as
being
the
patron
of
his
particular
friend
colburne
of
this
young
man
he
seemed
almost
as
fond
as
if
he
were
his
father
without
however
entertaining
the
slightest
thought
of
gaining
him
for
a
i
never
knew
nor
read
of
not
even
in
the
most
unnatural
novels
an
american
father
who
was
a
matchmaker
so
the
autumn
and
half
the
winter
passed
away
without
any
one
falling
in
love
unless
it
might
be
colburne
it
needed
all
his
good
sense
to
keep
him
from
it
or
rather
to
keep
him
from
paying
miss
ravenel
what
are
called
significant
attentions
for
as
to
his
being
in
love
i
admit
it
although
he
did
not
to
use
language
alarming
in
its
directness
and
strength
of
meaning
i
suppose
he
would
have
courted
her
if
she
would
have
let
him
but
there
was
something
in
the
young
manner
towards
him
which
kept
him
at
arm
length
which
had
the
charm
of
friendship
indeed
but
no
faintest
odor
of
even
the
possibility
of
love
just
as
certain
flowers
have
beauty
but
no
perfume
which
said
to
him
very
gently
but
also
very
firmly
colburne
you
had
better
not
be
in
a
hurry
at
times
he
was
under
sudden
and
violent
temptation
the
trusting
doctor
placed
lillie
under
his
charge
to
go
to
one
or
two
concerts
and
popular
lectures
following
therein
the
simple
and
virtuous
ways
of
new
boston
where
young
ladies
have
a
freedom
which
in
larger
and
wickeder
cities
is
only
accorded
to
married
women
on
the
way
to
and
from
these
amusements
lillie
hand
resting
lightly
on
his
arm
and
the
obscurity
of
the
streets
veiling
whatever
reproof
or
warning
might
sparkle
in
her
eyes
his
heart
was
more
urgent
and
his
soul
less
timid
than
usual
i
have
only
one
subject
of
regret
in
going
to
the
war
he
once
said
and
that
is
that
i
shall
not
see
you
for
a
long
time
and
may
never
see
you
again
there
was
a
magnetic
tremulousness
in
his
voice
which
thrilled
through
miss
ravenel
and
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
breathe
naturally
for
a
few
seconds
she
could
not
answer
any
more
than
he
could
continue
she
felt
as
we
do
in
dreams
when
we
seem
to
stand
on
the
edge
of
a
gulf
wavering
whether
we
shall
fall
backward
into
safety
or
forward
into
the
unknown
it
was
one
of
the
perilous
and
decisive
moments
of
the
young
lady
life
but
the
end
of
it
was
that
she
recovered
enough
to
speak
before
he
could
rally
to
pursue
his
advantage
ten
seconds
more
of
silence
might
have
resulted
in
an
engagement
ring
what
a
hard
heart
you
have
she
laughed
no
greater
cause
of
regret
than
that
and
here
you
are
going
to
lay
waste
my
country
and
perhaps
burn
up
my
house
you
abolitionists
are
dreadful
he
immediately
changed
his
manner
of
conversation
with
a
painful
consciousness
that
she
had
as
good
as
ordered
him
to
do
so
oh
i
have
no
sort
of
compunction
about
turning
the
south
into
a
desert
he
said
with
a
poor
attempt
at
making
merry
i
mean
to
take
a
bag
of
salt
with
me
and
sow
all
louisiana
with
it
and
the
rest
of
the
dialogue
until
he
left
her
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
was
conducted
in
the
same
style
of
laborious
and
painful
trifling
as
the
day
approached
for
the
sailing
of
the
regiment
colburne
looked
forward
with
dread
yet
with
eagerness
to
the
last
interview
at
times
he
thought
and
hoped
and
almost
expected
that
it
would
bring
about
some
decisive
expression
of
feeling
which
should
give
a
desirable
direction
to
the
perverse
heart
of
this
inexplicable
young
lady
then
he
reflected
during
certain
flashes
of
pure
reason
how
foolish
how
cruel
it
would
be
to
win
her
affection
only
to
quit
her
on
the
instant
certainly
for
months
probably
for
years
perhaps
for
ever
moreover
suppose
he
should
lose
a
leg
or
a
nose
in
his
first
battle
how
could
he
demand
that
she
should
keep
her
vows
and
yet
how
could
he
give
her
up
but
these
last
interviews
are
frequently
unsatisfactory
and
the
one
which
colburne
excitedly
anticipated
was
eminently
so
it
took
place
in
the
public
parlor
of
the
hotel
the
doctor
was
present
and
so
were
several
dowager
boarders
the
regiment
had
marched
through
the
city
in
the
afternoon
surrounded
and
cheered
by
crowds
of
enthusiastic
citizens
and
was
already
on
board
of
the
coasting
steamer
which
would
transfer
it
to
the
ocean
transport
at
new
york
colburne
had
obtained
permission
to
remain
in
new
boston
until
the
evening
through
train
from
the
east
this
is
a
proud
day
for
you
said
the
doctor
but
i
must
say
that
it
is
a
sad
one
for
me
i
am
truly
grieved
to
think
how
long
it
may
be
before
we
shall
see
you
again
i
hope
not
very
long
answered
the
young
man
with
a
gravity
and
sadness
which
did
not
consort
with
his
words
he
was
pale
nervous
and
feverish
partly
from
lack
of
sleep
the
night
before
i
really
think
it
will
not
be
very
long
he
repeated
after
a
moment
now
that
peace
was
apparently
his
only
chance
of
returning
to
miss
ravenel
he
longed
for
it
and
like
most
young
people
he
could
muster
confidence
to
believe
in
what
he
hoped
moreover
it
was
at
this
time
a
matter
of
northern
faith
that
the
contest
could
not
last
a
year
that
the
great
army
which
was
being
drilled
and
disciplined
on
the
banks
of
the
potomac
would
prove
irresistible
when
it
should
take
the
field
that
mcclellan
would
find
no
difficulty
in
trampling
out
the
life
of
the
rebellion
colonel
carter
doctor
ravenel
and
a
few
obstinate
old
hunker
democrats
were
the
only
persons
in
the
little
state
of
barataria
who
did
not
give
way
to
this
popular
conviction
where
are
you
going
mr
colburne
asked
lillie
eagerly
i
do
know
really
the
colonel
has
received
sealed
orders
he
is
not
to
open
them
until
we
have
been
hours
at
sea
oh
i
think
that
is
a
shame
i
do
think
that
is
abominable
said
the
young
lady
with
excitement
she
was
very
inquisitive
by
nature
and
she
was
particularly
anxious
to
know
if
the
regiment
would
reach
louisiana
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
we
shall
go
to
virginia
resumed
colburne
i
hope
so
the
great
battle
of
the
war
is
to
be
fought
there
and
i
want
to
take
part
in
it
poor
young
man
he
felt
like
saying
that
he
wanted
to
be
killed
in
it
mistaken
young
man
he
believed
that
there
would
be
but
one
great
battle
wherever
you
go
you
will
be
doing
your
duty
as
a
patriot
and
a
friend
of
the
interests
of
humanity
put
in
the
doctor
emphatically
i
confidently
anticipate
for
you
the
greatest
successes
i
anticipate
your
personal
success
colonel
carter
will
undoubtedly
be
made
a
general
and
you
will
return
the
commander
of
your
regiment
but
even
if
you
never
receive
a
grade
of
promotion
nor
have
a
chance
to
strike
a
blow
in
battle
you
will
still
have
performed
one
of
the
highest
duties
of
manhood
and
be
entitled
to
our
lasting
respect
i
sincerely
and
fervently
envy
you
the
feelings
which
you
will
be
able
to
carry
through
life
thank
you
sir
was
all
the
answer
that
colburne
could
think
of
at
the
moment
if
you
find
yourself
near
a
you
will
let
us
know
it
you
asked
lillie
with
a
thoughtless
frankness
for
which
she
immediately
blushed
painfully
in
the
desire
to
know
whether
louisiana
would
be
attacked
and
assaulted
by
colonel
carter
she
had
said
more
than
she
meant
colburne
brightened
into
a
grateful
smile
at
the
idea
that
he
might
venture
to
write
to
her
certainly
added
the
doctor
you
must
send
me
a
letter
at
once
when
you
reach
your
destination
colburne
promised
as
he
was
required
but
not
with
the
light
heart
which
had
shone
in
his
face
an
instant
before
it
was
sadly
clear
he
thought
that
he
must
not
on
any
account
write
to
miss
ravenel
and
now
i
must
say
and
god
bless
you
he
sighed
putting
out
his
hand
to
the
young
lady
while
his
face
grew
perceptibly
whiter
if
we
may
believe
the
reports
of
the
much
affected
dowager
spectators
as
miss
ravenel
gave
him
her
hand
her
cheeks
also
became
discolored
not
with
pallor
however
but
only
with
her
customary
blush
when
excited
i
do
hope
you
will
not
be
hurt
she
murmured
she
was
so
simply
kind
and
friendly
in
her
feelings
that
she
did
not
notice
with
any
thrill
of
emotion
the
fervent
pressure
the
clinging
as
of
despair
with
which
he
held
her
hand
for
a
few
seconds
an
hour
afterward
she
remembered
it
suddenly
blushing
as
she
interpreted
to
herself
its
significance
but
with
no
sentiment
either
of
love
or
anger
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
repeated
the
doctor
much
moved
let
me
know
as
early
and
as
often
as
possible
of
your
welfare
our
best
wishes
go
with
you
colburne
had
found
the
interview
so
painful
so
different
from
what
his
hopes
had
pictured
it
that
under
pretence
of
bidding
farewell
to
other
friends
he
left
the
hotel
half
an
hour
before
the
arrival
of
his
train
as
he
passed
through
the
outer
door
he
met
the
colonel
entering
ah
paid
you
adieux
said
carter
in
his
jaunty
way
i
must
say
to
those
nice
people
meet
you
at
the
train
colburne
merely
replied
very
well
sir
with
a
heart
as
gloomy
as
the
sour
february
weather
and
strolled
away
not
to
take
leave
of
any
more
friends
but
to
smoke
an
anchorite
uncomforting
segar
in
the
purlieus
of
the
station
delighted
to
have
found
you
said
the
colonel
intercepting
the
ravenels
as
they
were
leaving
the
parlor
for
their
rooms
miss
ravenel
i
have
neglected
my
duty
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasure
no
the
pain
of
bidding
you
the
doctor
cringed
at
this
speech
but
expressed
delight
at
the
visit
lillie
adorned
the
occasion
by
a
blush
as
sumptuous
as
a
bouquet
of
roses
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
parlor
defiant
of
her
evident
intention
to
shorten
the
scene
by
remaining
standing
in
the
hall
the
doctor
finding
himself
thus
retorted
by
taking
the
lead
in
the
conversation
and
talked
volubly
for
ten
minutes
of
the
magnificent
appearance
of
the
regiment
as
it
marched
through
the
city
of
the
probable
length
of
the
war
and
of
the
differing
characteristics
of
northerners
and
southerners
meanwhile
miss
ravenel
sat
quietly
after
the
fashion
of
a
french
saying
nothing
but
perhaps
thinking
all
the
more
dangerously
at
last
the
colonel
broke
loose
from
the
father
and
resolutely
addressed
himself
to
the
daughter
miss
ravenel
i
suppose
that
you
have
not
a
friendly
wish
to
send
with
me
i
do
know
why
i
should
have
she
replied
until
i
know
that
you
are
not
going
to
harm
my
people
but
i
have
no
very
bad
wishes
thank
you
for
that
he
said
with
a
more
serious
air
than
usual
i
do
sincerely
desire
that
your
feelings
were
such
as
that
i
could
consider
myself
to
be
fighting
your
cause
perhaps
you
will
find
before
we
get
through
that
i
am
fighting
it
if
we
should
go
to
new
orleans
which
is
among
the
possibilities
it
may
be
the
means
of
restoring
you
to
your
home
oh
i
should
thank
you
for
that
almost
i
should
be
tempted
to
feel
that
the
end
justified
the
means
let
me
hope
that
i
shall
meet
you
there
or
somewhere
soon
he
added
rising
his
manner
was
certainly
more
earnest
and
impressive
than
it
had
ever
been
before
in
addressing
her
the
tremor
of
her
hand
was
perceptible
to
the
strong
steady
hand
which
took
it
and
her
eyes
dropped
under
the
firm
gaze
which
met
them
and
which
for
the
first
time
she
thought
had
an
expression
deeply
significant
to
her
if
she
turns
out
to
have
any
prospects
thought
the
colonel
as
he
went
down
stairs
if
they
ever
get
back
their
southern
property
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
on
the
writing
tablets
of
his
soul
to
light
a
segar
his
impulses
and
passions
were
strong
when
once
aroused
but
on
this
subject
they
had
only
begun
to
awaken
chapter
ix
from
new
boston
to
new
orleans
via
fort
jackson
by
this
and
that
swore
colonel
carter
to
himself
when
hours
out
from
sandy
hook
he
opened
his
sealed
orders
in
the
privacy
of
his
butler
has
got
an
expedition
to
himself
we
are
in
for
a
round
of
big
bethels
as
sure
as
this
and
that
and
the
other
i
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
i
do
not
endorse
the
above
criticism
on
the
celebrated
proconsul
of
louisiana
i
am
not
sketching
the
life
of
general
butler
but
of
colonel
carter
i
am
not
trying
to
show
how
things
really
were
but
only
how
the
colonel
looked
at
them
carter
opened
the
door
and
looked
into
the
cabin
there
stood
a
particularly
clean
soldier
of
the
tenth
his
uniform
carefully
brushed
his
shoes
belts
and
blacked
his
buttons
and
brasses
shining
like
morning
suns
white
cotton
gloves
on
his
hands
and
his
bayonet
in
its
scabbard
but
without
a
musket
being
the
neatest
man
of
all
those
detailed
for
guard
that
morning
he
had
been
selected
by
the
adjutant
as
the
colonel
orderly
he
saluted
his
commander
by
carrying
his
right
hand
open
to
his
then
well
out
to
the
right
then
dropping
it
with
the
little
finger
against
the
seam
of
his
trousers
meanwhile
standing
bolt
upright
with
his
heels
well
together
the
colonel
surveyed
him
from
top
to
toe
with
a
look
of
approbation
very
well
orderly
said
he
very
clean
and
soldierly
been
in
the
old
army
i
see
here
he
gratified
himself
with
another
inspection
of
this
statue
of
neatness
and
speechless
respect
now
go
to
the
captain
of
the
vessel
he
added
give
him
my
compliments
and
request
him
to
step
to
my
the
orderly
saluted
again
faced
about
as
if
on
a
pivot
and
walked
away
here
come
back
sir
called
the
colonel
what
did
i
tell
you
you
told
me
sir
to
give
your
compliments
to
the
captain
of
the
vessel
and
request
him
to
step
to
your
replied
the
soldier
my
god
he
understood
the
first
time
exclaimed
the
colonel
been
in
the
old
army
i
see
quite
right
sir
go
on
in
a
few
minutes
the
marine
functionary
was
closeted
with
the
military
potentiality
sit
down
captain
said
the
colonel
take
a
glass
of
wine
no
thank
you
colonel
said
the
captain
a
small
brown
taciturn
man
of
his
locks
carefully
oiled
and
brushed
and
his
as
neat
as
possible
i
make
it
a
rule
at
sea
he
added
never
to
take
any
thing
but
a
bottle
of
porter
at
dinner
very
good
never
get
drunk
on
duty
good
rule
laughed
the
colonel
well
here
are
our
orders
look
them
over
captain
if
you
please
the
captain
read
lifted
his
eyebrows
with
an
air
of
comprehension
put
the
paper
back
in
the
envelope
returned
it
to
the
colonel
and
remarked
ship
island
it
would
be
best
to
say
nothing
about
it
at
present
observed
carter
some
accident
may
yet
send
us
back
to
new
york
and
then
the
thing
would
be
known
earlier
than
the
war
department
wants
very
good
i
will
lay
the
proper
course
and
say
nothing
and
so
with
a
little
further
talk
about
cleaning
quarters
and
cooking
rations
the
interview
terminated
it
was
not
till
the
transport
was
off
the
beach
of
ship
island
that
the
tenth
barataria
became
aware
of
its
destination
meantime
taking
advantage
of
a
run
of
smooth
weather
carter
disciplined
his
green
regiment
into
a
state
of
cleanliness
order
and
subserviency
which
made
it
a
wonder
to
itself
he
had
two
daily
inspections
with
regard
to
personal
cleanliness
going
through
the
companies
himself
praising
the
neat
and
remorselessly
punishing
the
dirty
what
do
you
mean
by
such
hair
as
that
sir
he
would
say
poking
up
a
set
of
long
locks
with
the
hilt
of
his
sabre
have
it
off
before
night
sir
have
it
cut
short
and
neatly
combed
by
morning
for
offences
which
to
the
freeborn
american
citizen
seemed
peccadilloes
or
even
virtues
such
as
saying
to
a
i
am
as
good
as
you
are
men
were
seized
up
by
the
wrists
to
the
rigging
with
their
toes
scarcely
touching
the
deck
the
soldiers
had
to
obey
orders
without
a
word
to
touch
their
caps
to
officers
to
stop
chaffing
the
sentinels
to
keep
off
the
and
out
of
the
cabin
by
this
and
that
i
teach
them
to
be
soldiers
swore
the
colonel
they
had
their
skylarking
in
barataria
they
are
on
duty
now
the
men
were
not
pleased
freeborn
americans
could
not
at
first
be
gratified
with
such
despotism
however
salutary
but
they
were
intelligent
enough
to
see
that
there
was
a
hard
practical
sense
at
the
bottom
of
it
they
not
only
feared
and
obeyed
but
they
respected
every
american
who
is
true
to
his
national
education
regards
with
consideration
a
man
who
knows
his
own
business
whenever
the
colonel
walked
on
the
main
deck
or
in
the
hold
where
the
men
were
quartered
there
was
a
silence
a
quiet
standing
out
of
the
way
a
rising
to
the
feet
and
a
touching
of
to
his
officers
carter
was
distant
and
authoritative
although
formally
courteous
it
was
lieutenant
have
the
goodness
to
order
those
men
down
from
the
rigging
and
to
keep
them
down
and
when
the
officer
of
the
day
reported
that
the
job
was
done
it
was
very
well
lieutenant
much
obliged
to
you
even
the
private
soldiers
whom
he
berated
and
punished
were
scrupulously
addressed
by
the
title
of
sir
my
god
sir
i
ought
not
to
be
obliged
to
speak
to
the
enlisted
men
at
all
he
observed
apologetically
to
the
captain
of
the
transport
a
colonel
in
the
old
army
was
a
little
deity
a
grand
lama
who
never
opened
his
mouth
except
on
the
greatest
occasions
but
my
officers
you
see
do
know
their
business
i
am
as
badly
off
as
you
would
be
if
your
mates
sailors
and
firemen
were
all
farmers
i
must
attend
to
things
myself
captain
colburne
he
said
on
another
occasion
how
about
your
property
returns
have
the
goodness
to
let
me
look
at
them
colburne
brought
two
packets
of
neatly
folded
papers
tied
up
in
the
famous
the
historical
the
proverbial
red
tape
and
endorsed
the
one
return
of
ordnance
and
ordnance
stores
appertaining
to
co
i
regt
barataria
for
the
quarter
ending
december
the
other
return
of
clothing
and
camp
and
garrison
equipage
appertaining
to
co
i
regt
barataria
for
the
quarter
ending
carter
glanced
over
the
footings
the
receipts
and
the
invoices
with
the
prompt
and
accurate
eye
of
a
bank
accountant
correct
said
he
very
much
to
your
credit
orderly
give
my
compliments
to
all
the
commandants
of
companies
and
request
them
to
call
on
me
immediately
in
the
after
cabin
one
after
another
the
captains
walked
in
saluted
and
took
seats
in
obedience
to
a
wave
of
the
colonel
hand
gentlemen
he
began
those
of
you
who
have
finished
your
property
returns
for
the
last
quarter
will
send
them
in
to
the
adjutant
this
afternoon
for
examination
those
who
have
not
will
proceed
to
complete
them
immediately
if
you
need
any
instructions
you
will
apply
to
captain
colburne
his
papers
are
correct
gentlemen
the
united
states
army
regulations
are
as
important
to
you
as
the
united
states
army
tactics
ignorance
of
one
will
get
you
into
trouble
as
surely
as
ignorance
of
the
other
such
parts
of
the
regulation
as
refer
to
the
army
accountability
system
are
of
especial
consequence
to
your
pockets
neglect
your
returns
and
you
will
get
your
pay
stopped
this
is
not
properly
my
business
you
are
responsible
for
yourselves
directly
to
the
war
department
but
i
wish
to
set
you
on
the
right
path
you
ought
to
take
a
pride
gentlemen
in
learning
the
whole
of
your
profession
even
if
you
are
sure
that
the
war
will
not
last
three
months
if
a
thing
is
worth
learning
at
all
it
should
be
learned
well
if
only
for
the
good
of
a
man
own
soul
never
do
a
duty
by
halves
no
man
of
any
will
accept
an
officer
pay
without
performing
the
whole
of
an
officer
duty
and
this
accountability
system
is
worth
study
it
is
the
most
admirable
system
of
bookkeeping
that
ever
was
devised
john
calhoun
perfected
it
when
he
was
secretary
of
war
and
at
the
top
of
his
intellectual
powers
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
a
man
who
can
account
truthfully
and
without
loss
for
all
the
public
property
in
a
company
according
to
this
system
is
able
to
master
the
business
of
any
mercantile
house
or
banking
establishment
the
system
is
as
minute
and
inexorable
as
a
when
i
was
a
boy
just
out
of
west
point
and
in
command
of
a
company
on
the
indian
frontier
i
took
part
in
a
skirmish
i
was
as
vain
over
my
first
fight
as
a
kitten
over
its
first
mouse
i
thought
the
fame
of
it
must
illuminate
washington
and
dazzle
the
clerks
in
the
department
offices
in
my
next
return
i
accounted
for
three
missing
as
lost
in
the
engagement
of
trapper
bluff
i
supposed
the
army
accountability
system
would
bow
to
a
who
had
been
under
fire
but
gentlemen
it
did
no
such
thing
i
got
a
letter
from
the
chief
of
ordnance
informing
me
that
i
must
state
circumstantially
and
on
honor
the
three
were
lost
i
could
do
it
could
make
out
a
satisfactory
certificate
and
had
them
taken
out
of
my
pay
i
the
hero
of
an
engagement
who
had
personally
shot
a
pawnee
was
charged
cents
for
three
emboldened
by
the
colonel
smiles
of
grim
humor
the
audience
burst
into
a
laugh
i
knew
another
case
he
proceeded
a
young
fellow
was
appointed
quartermaster
at
puget
sound
about
a
year
after
he
had
sent
in
his
first
return
he
was
notified
by
the
quartermaster
general
that
it
did
not
properly
account
for
certain
cap
letters
value
five
cents
indignant
at
what
he
considered
such
he
immediately
mailed
five
cents
to
washington
with
a
statement
that
it
was
intended
to
cover
the
deficiency
six
months
later
he
received
a
sharp
note
from
the
quartermaster
general
returning
him
his
five
cents
informing
him
that
the
department
was
not
accustomed
to
settle
accounts
in
that
manner
and
directing
him
to
forward
the
proper
papers
concerning
the
missing
property
under
penalty
of
being
reported
to
the
adjutant
general
the
last
i
knew
of
him
he
was
still
corresponding
on
the
subject
and
hoping
that
the
rebels
would
take
enough
of
washington
to
burn
the
quartermaster
department
now
gentlemen
this
is
not
nonsense
it
is
business
and
sense
as
any
bank
cashier
will
tell
you
means
order
accuracy
honesty
solvency
a
defalcation
of
five
cents
is
as
bad
in
principle
as
a
defalcation
of
a
million
i
tell
you
these
stories
to
give
you
an
idea
of
what
will
be
exacted
of
you
some
time
or
other
it
may
be
soon
but
certainly
at
last
i
wish
you
to
complete
your
returns
as
soon
as
possible
they
ought
to
have
gone
in
long
since
that
is
all
gentlemen
i
talked
to
them
like
a
dutch
uncle
said
carter
to
the
captain
of
the
transport
after
relating
the
above
interview
the
fact
is
that
in
the
regular
army
we
generally
left
the
returns
to
the
first
sergeants
when
i
was
in
command
of
a
company
i
gave
mine
the
ten
dollars
monthly
for
accountability
and
hardly
ever
saw
my
papers
except
when
i
signed
them
all
made
up
and
ready
to
forward
but
here
the
first
sergeants
confound
them
do
know
so
much
as
the
officers
the
officers
must
do
every
thing
personally
and
i
must
set
them
the
example
so
much
at
present
for
carter
as
chief
of
a
volunteer
regiment
which
it
was
his
duty
and
pride
to
transform
into
a
regiment
of
regulars
professionally
if
not
personally
as
a
soldier
if
not
as
a
man
he
had
an
imperious
conscience
and
his
aristocratic
breeding
and
tolerably
hard
heart
enabled
him
to
obey
it
in
this
matter
of
discipline
without
hesitation
or
pity
and
now
in
the
calm
leisure
of
this
winter
voyage
over
summer
seas
let
us
go
back
a
little
in
his
history
and
see
what
kind
of
a
life
his
had
been
outside
of
the
regulations
and
devoirs
of
the
army
how
rapidly
times
change
he
said
to
colburne
in
a
moment
of
unusual
communicativeness
three
years
ago
i
expected
to
take
a
regiment
or
so
across
this
gulf
on
a
very
different
errand
i
was
by
this
and
that
a
filibuster
and
champion
in
those
days
at
least
by
intention
i
was
closeted
with
the
lamars
and
the
soules
the
governor
of
south
carolina
and
the
governor
of
mississippi
and
the
governor
of
louisiana
the
gentlemen
who
proposed
to
carry
the
of
freedom
into
yucatan
cuba
the
island
of
atalantis
and
the
moon
i
expected
to
be
a
second
cortez
not
that
i
cared
much
about
their
projects
and
palaverings
i
was
a
soldier
of
fortune
only
anxious
for
active
service
pay
and
promotion
i
might
have
been
monarch
of
all
i
surveyed
by
this
time
if
the
world
had
turned
as
we
expected
but
this
war
broke
up
my
prospects
they
saw
it
coming
and
decided
that
they
must
husband
their
resources
for
it
it
was
necessary
to
take
sides
for
a
greater
struggle
than
the
one
we
wanted
they
chose
their
party
and
i
chose
mine
these
confessions
were
too
fragmentary
and
guarded
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
colburne
but
he
subsequently
obtained
information
in
the
south
from
which
he
was
able
to
piece
out
this
part
of
carter
history
and
the
facts
are
perhaps
worth
repeating
as
illustrative
of
the
man
and
his
times
our
knowledge
is
sufficiently
complete
to
enable
us
to
decide
that
the
part
which
he
played
in
the
filibustering
conspiracy
was
not
that
of
a
burr
but
of
a
walker
which
indeed
might
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
he
was
not
intellectually
capable
of
making
himself
head
of
a
cabal
which
included
some
of
the
cleverest
of
the
though
not
statesmen
of
the
south
it
is
no
special
reflection
on
the
colonel
brains
to
say
that
they
were
not
equal
to
those
of
soule
and
jefferson
davis
moreover
a
soldier
is
usually
a
poor
intriguer
because
his
profession
rarely
leads
him
to
appeal
to
any
other
influence
than
open
authority
he
is
not
obliged
to
learn
the
essential
arts
of
convincing
wheedling
and
circumventing
he
simply
says
to
his
man
go
and
he
goeth
carter
then
was
to
be
the
commander
of
the
regiment
or
brigade
or
division
or
whatever
might
be
the
proposed
force
of
armed
filibusters
there
appears
to
have
been
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
ringleaders
as
to
his
fidelity
he
was
a
virginian
born
and
of
a
family
which
sat
in
the
upper
seats
of
the
southern
oligarchy
furthermore
he
had
married
a
wife
and
certain
appertaining
human
property
in
louisiana
and
although
he
had
buried
the
first
and
dissolved
the
second
as
cleopatra
did
pearls
in
the
wine
cup
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
had
exercised
an
establishing
influence
on
his
character
for
what
yankee
even
was
ever
known
to
remain
an
abolitionist
after
having
once
tasted
the
pleasure
of
living
by
the
labor
of
others
moreover
he
had
become
agent
and
honorary
stockholder
of
a
company
which
had
a
new
patent
rifle
to
dispose
of
and
it
was
an
item
of
the
filibustering
bargain
that
the
expeditionary
force
should
be
armed
with
ordnance
furnished
by
this
pennsylvania
manufactory
finally
having
melted
down
his
own
and
his
wife
patrimony
in
the
crucible
of
pleasure
and
been
driven
by
debts
to
resign
his
lieutenancy
for
something
which
promised
but
did
not
provide
a
better
income
he
was
known
to
be
dreadfully
in
need
of
money
it
is
impossible
to
make
the
whole
conspiracy
a
matter
of
plain
and
positive
history
colburne
thought
he
had
learned
that
at
least
two
or
three
thousand
men
were
sworn
in
as
officers
and
soldiers
and
that
the
governors
of
several
southern
states
had
pledged
themselves
to
support
it
even
at
the
risk
of
being
obliged
to
bully
the
venerable
public
functionary
who
then
occupied
the
white
house
it
is
certain
that
councils
of
state
and
war
were
held
in
the
mills
house
at
charleston
and
in
the
charles
hotel
at
new
orleans
it
is
even
asserted
that
a
distinguished
southern
divine
was
present
at
some
of
these
sessions
and
gave
his
blessing
to
the
plan
as
one
of
the
most
hopeful
missionary
enterprises
of
the
day
and
the
story
ironical
as
it
may
seem
to
misguided
yankees
becomes
seriously
credible
when
we
remember
that
certain
devout
southerners
advocated
the
itself
as
a
means
of
christianizing
benighted
africans
where
the
expedition
was
to
go
and
when
it
was
to
sail
are
still
points
of
uncertainty
carter
himself
never
told
and
perhaps
was
not
let
into
the
secret
his
part
was
to
draw
over
as
many
of
his
old
comrades
as
possible
to
organize
the
enlisted
men
into
companies
and
regiments
and
to
command
the
force
when
it
should
once
be
landed
concerning
the
causes
of
the
failure
of
the
enterprise
we
know
nothing
more
than
what
he
stated
to
colburne
the
arch
conspirators
foresaw
the
election
of
lincoln
and
resolved
to
save
the
material
and
enthusiasm
of
the
south
for
war
at
home
it
is
pretty
certain
however
that
they
sought
to
bring
carter
courage
and
professional
ability
into
the
new
channel
which
they
had
resolved
to
open
for
such
qualities
and
we
can
only
wonder
that
a
man
of
such
desperate
fortunes
apparently
such
a
mere
dugald
dalgetty
was
not
seduced
into
treason
by
their
no
doubt
earnest
persuasions
and
flattering
promises
he
may
have
resisted
their
blandishments
merely
because
he
knew
that
the
other
side
was
the
strongest
and
richest
but
if
we
are
charitable
we
will
concede
that
it
argued
in
him
some
still
uneradicated
roots
of
military
honor
and
patriotism
at
all
events
here
he
was
confident
cheerful
and
jealous
going
forth
to
fight
for
his
old
flag
and
his
whole
country
this
vague
and
unsatisfactory
story
of
the
conspiracy
would
not
have
been
worth
relating
did
it
not
shed
some
cloudy
light
on
the
man
dubious
history
and
contradictory
character
we
may
take
it
for
granted
that
captain
colburne
devoted
much
of
his
time
during
this
voyage
to
meditations
on
miss
ravenel
but
reveries
not
being
popular
reading
in
these
days
i
shall
omit
all
the
interesting
matter
thus
offered
notwithstanding
that
the
young
man
has
my
earnest
sympathies
and
good
wishes
one
march
morning
the
steam
transport
black
with
men
lay
bowing
to
the
of
ship
island
and
by
sunset
the
regiment
was
ashore
the
camp
marked
out
tents
pitched
rations
cooking
and
line
formed
for
an
instance
of
military
promptness
which
elicited
the
praises
of
generals
phelps
and
butler
it
is
well
known
that
the
expedition
against
new
orleans
started
from
ship
island
as
its
base
over
the
organization
of
the
enterprise
the
battalion
and
brigade
drills
on
the
dazzling
sands
the
fights
in
the
offing
with
rebel
cruisers
from
mobile
the
arrival
of
frigates
and
porter
and
the
grand
review
of
the
expeditionary
force
i
must
hurry
without
a
word
of
description
although
i
might
make
up
a
volume
on
these
subjects
from
the
newspapers
of
the
day
and
from
three
or
four
long
and
enthusiastic
letters
which
colburne
wrote
to
ravenel
but
these
matters
do
not
properly
come
within
the
scope
of
this
narrative
which
is
biographical
and
not
historical
parenthetically
it
may
be
well
to
remark
that
neither
carter
nor
colburne
ever
referred
to
miss
ravenel
in
their
few
and
brief
interviews
the
latter
was
not
disposed
to
talk
of
her
to
that
listener
and
the
former
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
duties
to
give
much
thought
to
an
absent
dulcinea
the
colonel
was
no
longer
in
that
youthfully
tender
stage
when
absence
increases
affection
to
make
him
love
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
woman
in
pretty
close
personal
propinquity
in
a
month
or
two
from
the
arrival
of
the
tenth
barataria
at
ship
island
it
was
again
on
board
a
transport
this
time
bound
for
new
orleans
fort
jackson
this
part
of
louisiana
looks
as
the
world
must
have
looked
in
the
marsupial
period
says
colburne
in
a
letter
to
the
doctor
written
from
the
head
of
the
passes
there
are
two
narrow
but
seemingly
endless
antenn√¶
of
land
between
them
rolls
a
river
and
outside
of
them
spreads
an
ocean
dry
land
there
is
none
for
the
mississippi
being
unusually
high
the
soil
is
submerged
and
the
trees
and
shrubs
of
these
long
ribbons
of
underwood
which
enclose
us
have
their
boles
in
the
water
i
do
not
understand
why
the
ichthyosauri
should
have
died
out
in
louisiana
it
certainly
is
not
fitted
so
far
as
i
can
see
for
human
habitation
may
it
not
have
been
the
chaos
milton
through
which
satan
floundered
miss
ravenel
will
i
trust
forgive
me
for
this
hypothesis
when
she
learns
that
it
is
suggested
by
your
theory
that
lucifer
was
and
is
and
ever
will
be
peculiarly
at
home
in
this
part
of
the
world
in
a
subsequent
passage
he
gives
a
long
account
of
the
famous
bombardment
of
the
forts
which
i
feel
obliged
to
suppress
as
not
strictly
biographical
he
not
being
under
fire
but
only
an
and
of
the
cannonade
one
paragraph
alone
i
deem
it
worth
while
to
copy
being
a
curious
analysis
of
the
feelings
of
the
individual
in
the
presence
of
sublime
but
monotonous
circumstance
here
we
are
in
view
of
what
i
am
told
is
the
greatest
bombardment
known
in
marine
or
as
i
should
call
it
amphibious
warfare
you
take
it
for
granted
i
suppose
that
we
are
in
a
state
of
constant
and
noble
excitement
but
the
extraordinary
truth
is
that
we
are
in
a
condition
of
wearisome
and
deplorable
we
are
too
ignorant
of
the
great
scientific
problems
of
war
to
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
fearful
equation
of
we
got
tired
a
week
ago
of
the
mere
auricular
pleasure
of
the
incessant
bombing
we
got
tired
a
day
or
two
afterward
of
climbing
to
the
crosstrees
to
look
at
the
fading
globes
of
smoke
left
aloft
in
the
air
by
the
bursting
shells
we
are
totally
tired
of
the
monotonous
flow
of
the
muddy
river
and
the
interminable
parallel
curves
of
its
natural
levees
and
the
glassy
stretches
of
ocean
which
seem
to
slope
upwards
toward
the
eastern
and
western
horizon
we
pass
our
time
in
playing
cards
smoking
grumbling
at
our
wretched
fare
exchanging
dull
gossip
and
wishing
that
we
might
be
allowed
to
do
something
happy
is
the
man
who
chances
once
a
day
to
find
a
clear
space
of
a
dozen
feet
on
the
crowded
deck
where
he
can
take
a
constitutional
waiting
for
a
belated
train
alone
in
a
country
railroad
station
is
not
half
so
wearisome
but
in
a
subsequent
page
of
the
same
letter
he
makes
record
of
startling
events
and
vivid
emotions
the
fleet
has
forced
the
passage
of
the
forts
we
have
had
a
day
and
a
night
of
almost
crazy
excitement
a
battle
a
victory
a
glorious
feat
of
arms
has
been
achieved
within
our
hearing
though
beyond
our
sight
and
range
of
action
a
submerged
one
of
the
wrecks
of
the
enemy
fleet
drifted
against
our
cable
shook
us
over
the
edge
of
eternity
and
then
floated
by
harmlessly
blazing
have
passed
us
lighting
up
the
midnight
river
until
its
ripples
seemed
of
flame
in
another
part
of
the
letter
he
says
the
forts
have
surrendered
and
we
are
steaming
up
the
mississippi
in
the
track
of
that
amazing
farragut
as
i
look
around
me
with
what
knowledge
of
science
there
is
in
my
eyes
i
feel
as
if
i
had
lived
a
few
millions
of
years
since
yesterday
for
within
hours
we
have
sailed
out
of
the
marsupial
period
into
the
comparatively
modern
era
of
fluvial
deposits
and
luxuriant
vegetation
give
my
compliments
to
miss
ravenel
and
tell
her
that
i
modify
my
criticisms
on
the
scenery
of
louisiana
on
either
side
the
land
is
a
living
emerald
the
plantation
houses
are
embowered
in
orange
groves
in
a
glossy
mass
of
brilliant
fragrant
verdure
i
do
not
know
the
names
of
a
quarter
of
the
plants
and
trees
which
i
see
but
i
pass
the
livelong
day
in
admiring
and
almost
adoring
their
tropical
beauty
we
are
no
welcome
tourists
at
least
not
to
the
white
inhabitants
very
few
of
them
show
themselves
and
they
do
not
answer
our
cheering
nor
hardly
look
at
us
they
walk
or
ride
grimly
by
with
faces
set
straight
forward
as
if
they
could
thereby
ignore
our
existence
but
to
the
negroes
we
evidently
appear
as
friends
and
redeemers
such
joyous
gatherings
of
dark
faces
such
shouts
of
welcome
and
deliverance
such
a
waving
of
green
boughs
and
white
vestments
and
even
of
pickaninnies
such
a
bending
of
knees
and
visible
praising
of
god
for
his
and
at
last
realized
mercy
salutes
our
eyes
from
morn
till
night
as
makes
me
grateful
to
heaven
for
this
hour
of
holy
triumph
how
glorious
will
be
that
time
now
near
at
hand
when
our
country
will
be
free
of
the
shame
and
curse
of
slavery
miss
ravenel
spit
in
her
angry
fashion
when
her
father
read
to
her
this
passage
of
the
letter
we
are
in
new
orleans
proceeds
colburne
towards
the
close
of
this
prodigious
epistle
our
regiment
was
the
first
to
reach
the
city
and
to
witness
the
bareness
of
the
wharves
the
desertion
of
the
streets
and
the
sullen
spite
of
the
few
remaining
inhabitants
i
suspect
that
your
aristocratic
acquaintances
have
all
fled
at
the
approach
of
the
vandal
yankees
for
i
see
only
negroes
poor
foreigners
and
rowdies
more
than
the
tribes
of
the
bowery
the
spirit
of
impotent
but
impertinent
hate
in
this
population
is
astonishing
the
ragged
will
not
sell
us
a
paper
the
beggarly
restaurants
will
not
furnish
us
a
dinner
wherever
i
walk
i
am
saluted
by
mutterings
of
yankee
his
heart
out
i
once
more
profess
allegiance
to
your
theory
that
this
is
where
satan
seat
is
but
the
evil
spirits
who
inhabit
this
city
of
desolation
only
grimace
and
mumble
without
attempting
any
manner
of
injury
if
miss
ravenel
fears
that
there
will
be
a
popular
insurrection
and
a
consequent
burning
of
the
city
assure
her
from
me
that
she
may
dismiss
all
such
terrors
and
here
from
mere
lack
of
space
rather
than
of
interesting
matter
i
must
close
my
extracts
from
this
incomparably
elongated
letter
i
question
by
the
way
whether
colburne
would
have
covered
so
much
paper
had
he
not
been
reasonably
justified
in
imagining
a
pretty

chapter
x
the
ravenels
find
captain
colburne
in
good
quarters
the
spring
and
summer
of
was
a
time
of
such
peace
and
pleasantness
to
the
tenth
barataria
as
if
there
had
been
no
war
with
the
major
general
commanding
carter
was
a
favorite
as
being
a
man
who
had
seen
service
a
most
efficient
officer
an
old
regular
and
a
west
pointer
the
tenth
was
a
pet
as
being
clean
admirably
accoutred
and
thoroughly
instructed
in
those
formal
niceties
and
watchful
severities
of
guard
duty
which
are
harder
to
teach
to
new
soldiers
than
the
minuti√¶
of
the
manual
or
the
perplexities
of
field
evolutions
or
the
grim
earnestness
of
fighting
the
colonel
was
appointed
major
of
new
orleans
with
a
suspicion
of
something
handsome
in
addition
to
his
pay
the
regiment
was
put
on
provost
duty
in
the
city
instead
of
being
sent
into
the
malarious
mud
of
camp
parapet
or
the
feverish
trenches
of
vicksburgh
colburne
letters
of
those
days
are
full
of
braggadocio
about
the
splendid
condition
of
the
tenth
and
the
peculiar
favor
with
which
it
was
viewed
by
the
commanding
general
doctor
ravenel
in
his
admiration
for
the
young
captain
unwisely
published
some
of
these
complacent
epistles
thereby
eliciting
retorts
and
taunts
from
the
literary
champions
of
rival
regiments
the
du
having
already
grown
into
a
strong
and
touchy
sentiment
among
the
volunteer
organizations
in
this
new
capua
the
only
lap
of
luxury
that
our
armies
found
during
the
war
carter
a
curious
compound
of
hardihood
and
sybaritism
forgot
that
he
wanted
to
be
hannibal
and
that
he
had
not
yet
fought
his
cann√¶
he
gave
himself
up
to
lazy
pleasures
and
even
allowed
his
officers
to
run
to
the
same
in
which
they
were
not
much
discountenanced
by
the
commanding
general
whose
grim
practical
humor
was
perhaps
gratified
by
the
spectacle
of
freeborn
mudsills
dwelling
in
the
palaces
and
emptying
the
of
a
rebellious
aristocracy
if
indeed
an
undesirable
cub
some
vague
boundary
he
found
himself
and
dismissed
the
service
but
the
mass
of
the
regimental
officers
being
jealous
in
their
light
duties
and
not
prominently
obnoxious
in
character
were
permitted
to
live
in
such
circumstances
of
comfort
as
they
chose
to
gather
about
them
from
the
property
of
secessionists
thus
the
regiment
went
through
the
season
no
battles
no
marches
no
privations
no
exposures
no
anxieties
not
even
any
weakening
loss
from
the
perilous
climate
that
terrible
guardian
angel
of
the
land
yellow
jack
would
not
come
to
realize
the
fond
predictions
of
the
inhabitants
and
abolish
the
alien
garrison
as
a
similar
seraph
destroyed
the
host
of
sennacherib
do
you
find
it
hot
said
a
citizen
to
captain
colburne
find
it
too
much
for
you
yet
pshaw
answered
the
defiant
youth
i
seen
it
hotter
than
this
in
barataria
with
two
feet
of
snow
on
the
ground
during
the
spring
colburne
wrote
several
long
letters
to
the
doctor
with
his
mind
you
may
believe
fixed
more
on
miss
ravenel
than
on
his
nominal
correspondent
it
was
a
case
of
moral
strabismus
which
like
many
a
physical
squint
was
not
without
its
beauty
and
was
even
quite
charming
to
the
gaze
of
sentimental
sympathy
it
was
a
sly
carom
on
the
father
with
the
intention
of
pocketing
the
daughter
but
done
with
a
hand
rendered
so
timorous
by
anxiety
that
the
blows
seemed
to
be
struck
at
random
the
captain
enjoyed
this
correspondence
at
times
he
felt
all
by
himself
as
if
he
were
talking
with
the
young
lady
his
hazel
eyes
sparkled
and
his
clear
cheeks
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
the
imaginary
interview
he
dropped
his
pen
and
pushed
up
his
wavy
brown
hair
into
careless
tangles
as
was
his
wont
in
gleesome
conversation
but
this
happiness
was
not
without
its
counterweight
of
trouble
so
that
there
might
be
no
failure
of
equilibrium
in
the
moral
balance
of
the
universe
after
colburne
had
received
two
responses
to
his
epistles
there
ensued
a
silence
which
caused
him
many
lugubrious
misgivings
were
the
ravenels
sick
or
dead
had
they
gone
to
canada
or
europe
to
escape
the
jealous
and
exacting
loyalty
of
new
england
were
they
offended
at
something
which
he
had
written
was
lillie
to
be
married
to
young
whitewood
or
some
other
conveniently
propinquitous
admirer
the
truth
is
that
the
doctor
had
obtained
a
permit
from
the
government
to
go
to
new
orleans
and
that
the
letter
in
which
he
informed
colburne
of
his
plan
had
miscarried
as
frequently
happened
to
letters
in
those
days
of
confusion
on
a
certain
scorching
day
in
june
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
neat
little
brick
house
which
had
been
assigned
to
the
captain
as
his
quarters
it
was
opened
by
an
officer
in
the
uniform
of
a
a
man
of
remarkable
presence
very
dark
and
saturnine
in
visage
tall
and
and
huge
chested
with
the
limbs
of
a
heenan
and
the
ringing
bass
voice
of
a
susini
he
informed
the
visitor
that
captain
colburne
was
out
but
insisted
with
an
amicable
boisterousness
upon
his
entering
he
had
an
elaborate
and
ostentatious
courtesy
of
manner
which
puzzled
the
doctor
who
could
not
decide
whether
he
was
a
born
and
bred
gentleman
or
a
professional
gambler
nearly
dinner
time
sir
he
said
in
a
rolling
deep
tone
like
mellow
thunder
the
captain
will
be
in
soon
for
that
good
and
sufficient
reason
you
will
dine
with
us
i
hope
give
you
some
capital
wine
sir
out
of
monsieur
soul√©
own
take
this
oaken
sir
and
allow
me
to
relieve
you
of
your
chapeau
what
name
may
i
ask
ah
doctor
my
god
sir
the
captain
has
a
letter
for
you
i
saw
it
on
his
table
a
moment
ago
he
commenced
rummaging
among
papers
and
writing
materials
with
an
exhilaration
of
haste
which
caused
ravenel
to
suspect
that
he
had
taken
a
bottle
or
so
of
the
soul√©
sherry
here
it
is
he
exclaimed
with
a
smile
of
triumph
and
friendliness
you
had
better
take
it
while
you
see
it
if
you
are
a
lawyer
sir
you
are
aware
that
possession
is
nine
tenths
of
a
title
i
beg
pardon
of
course
you
are
not
a
lawyer
or
have
i
the
honor
to
address
an
l
merely
an
observed
ravenel
and
took
his
letter
a
magnificent
profession
rejoined
the
sonorous
lieutenant
most
ancient
and
honorable
profession
the
profession
of
esculapius
and
hippocrates
the
physician
is
older
than
the
lawyer
and
more
useful
to
humanity
ravenel
looked
at
his
letter
and
observed
that
it
was
not
nor
sealed
he
opened
it
and
found
that
it
was
from
colburne
to
himself
intended
to
go
no
doubt
by
the
next
steamer
i
hope
it
gives
you
good
news
from
home
sir
observed
the
lieutenant
in
the
most
amicable
manner
the
doctor
bowed
and
smiled
assent
as
he
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
not
thinking
it
worth
while
to
explain
matters
to
a
gentleman
who
was
so
evidently
muddled
by
the
soul√©
vintages
as
his
interlocutor
rattled
on
he
looked
about
the
room
and
admired
the
costly
furniture
and
tasteful
ornaments
there
were
two
choice
paintings
on
the
paneled
walls
and
a
dozen
or
so
of
choice
engravings
the
damask
curtains
edged
with
lace
were
superb
and
so
were
the
damask
coverings
of
the
elaborately
carved
oaken
chairs
and
lounges
the
marble
mantels
and
table
and
the
extravagant
were
loaded
with
italian
cameos
parisian
bronzes
bohemian
swiss
and
other
varieties
of
european
gimcracks
against
the
wall
in
one
corner
leaned
four
huge
albums
of
photographs
and
engravings
the
doctor
thought
that
he
had
never
before
seen
a
house
in
america
decorated
with
such
exquisite
taste
and
lavish
expenditure
he
had
not
been
in
it
before
and
did
not
know
who
was
its
proprietor
elegant
little
box
sir
observed
the
lieutenant
it
belongs
to
a
gentleman
who
is
now
a
captain
in
the
rebel
service
he
built
and
furnished
it
for
his
affinity
an
actress
whom
he
brought
over
from
paris
which
disgusted
his
wife
i
understand
some
women
are
devilish
exacting
sir
here
the
humor
of
a
satyr
gleamed
in
his
black
eyes
and
grinned
under
his
black
mustache
you
will
see
her
portrait
the
affinity
not
the
wife
all
over
the
house
as
she
appeared
in
her
various
characters
and
here
she
is
in
her
in
her
own
natural
part
of
a
plain
affinity
he
pointed
with
another
grin
to
a
large
photograph
representing
the
bust
and
face
of
a
woman
apparently
or
thirty
years
of
age
who
could
not
have
been
handsome
but
judging
by
the
air
of
life
and
cleverness
might
have
been
quite
charming
intelligent
old
girl
i
should
say
sir
continued
the
cicerone
regardless
of
the
doctor
look
of
disgust
but
not
precisely
to
my
taste
i
like
them
more
youthful
and
innocent
with
something
of
the
down
of
girlhood
purity
about
them
what
is
your
opinion
sir
thus
bullied
the
doctor
admitted
that
he
entertained
much
the
same
preferences
at
the
same
time
wishing
heartily
in
his
soul
that
colburne
would
arrive
we
have
devilish
fine
times
here
sir
pursued
the
other
in
his
remorseless
garrulity
we
finished
the
rebel
captain
long
ago
and
are
now
living
on
old
soul√©
emptied
bottles
of
madeira
and
champagne
yesterday
select
party
of
loyal
friends
sir
from
our
own
regiment
the
bullissimo
tenth
barataria
ah
you
belong
to
the
tenth
inquired
the
doctor
with
interest
yes
sir
proud
to
own
it
sir
the
best
regiment
in
either
service
not
that
i
enlisted
in
barataria
i
had
the
honor
of
being
the
first
man
to
join
it
here
i
was
in
the
rebel
service
sir
an
unwilling
victim
dragged
as
an
innocent
sheep
to
the
slaughter
and
took
a
part
much
against
my
inclinations
in
the
defence
of
fort
jackson
it
seemed
to
me
sir
that
the
day
of
judgment
had
come
and
the
angel
was
blowing
particular
hell
out
of
his
trumpet
those
shells
of
porter
killed
men
and
buried
them
at
one
rap
my
eyes
stuck
out
so
to
watch
for
them
that
they
hav
got
back
into
their
proper
place
yet
after
the
fleet
forced
the
passage
i
was
the
first
man
to
raise
the
standard
of
revolt
and
bid
defiance
to
my
officers
i
then
made
the
best
time
on
record
to
new
orleans
and
enlisted
under
the
dear
old
flag
of
my
country
in
captain
colburne
company
i
took
a
fancy
to
the
captain
at
first
sight
i
saw
that
he
was
a
born
gentleman
and
a
scholar
sir
i
was
first
made
sergeant
for
good
conduct
obedience
to
orders
and
knowledge
of
my
business
and
when
the
of
the
company
died
of
bilious
fever
i
was
promoted
to
the
vacancy
our
colonel
sir
prefers
gentlemen
for
officers
i
am
of
an
old
knickerbocker
family
one
of
the
aboriginal
peter
stuyvesant
knickerbockers
as
you
may
infer
from
my
name
van
zandt
at
your
service
sir
cornelius
van
zandt
co
i
tenth
regiment
barataria
volunteers
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
hope
to
see
much
of
you
i
hope
not
thought
the
doctor
with
a
shudder
but
he
bowed
smiled
and
continued
to
wait
for
colburne
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
receiving
you
here
often
van
zandt
went
on
always
give
you
a
decent
bottle
of
wine
when
the
soul√©
gives
out
there
are
others
to
be
had
for
the
asking
by
the
way
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
allow
me
to
offer
you
a
bumper
of
madeira
you
refuse
then
sir
permit
me
the
pleasure
of
drinking
your
health
he
drank
it
in
a
silver
goblet
holding
as
much
as
a
tumbler
to
the
astonishment
if
not
to
the
horror
of
the
temperate
doctor
i
was
remarking
i
believe
sir
he
resumed
that
i
am
a
descendant
of
the
venerable
knickerbockers
if
you
doubt
it
i
beg
leave
to
refer
you
to
colonel
carter
who
knew
my
family
in
new
york
i
am
sensitive
on
the
subject
in
all
its
bearings
i
have
a
sort
of
feud
an
ancestral
vendetta
with
washington
irving
on
account
of
his
history
of
new
york
it
casts
an
undeserved
ridicule
on
the
respectable
race
from
which
i
am
proud
to
trace
my
lineage
my
old
mother
sir
god
bless
her
never
could
be
induced
to
receive
washington
irving
at
her
house
by
the
way
i
was
speaking
of
colonel
carter
i
think
sir
a
judge
of
old
blue
blood
sir
comes
of
an
ancient
cavalier
strain
himself
what
you
might
call
old
virginia
particular
a
splendid
man
sir
a
born
gentleman
an
officer
to
the
the
best
colonel
in
the
service
and
soon
will
be
the
best
general
when
he
comes
to
show
himself
in
field
service
these
will
have
to
take
the
back
seats
i
assume
whatever
responsibility
there
may
be
in
predicting
it
and
i
request
you
to
mark
my
words
i
am
willing
to
back
them
with
a
fifty
or
so
though
do
understand
me
as
being
so
impertinent
as
to
offer
you
a
bet
i
am
perfectly
well
aware
of
the
respect
due
to
your
clerical
profession
sir
i
was
only
supposing
that
i
might
fall
into
conversation
on
the
subject
with
a
betting
character
i
feel
bound
to
tell
you
how
much
i
admire
captain
colburne
of
whom
i
think
i
was
speaking
he
saw
that
i
was
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
education
by
the
way
did
i
tell
you
that
i
am
a
graduate
of
columbia
college
he
saw
that
i
was
above
my
place
in
the
ranks
and
he
started
me
on
my
career
of
promotion
i
would
go
to
the
death
for
him
sir
he
is
a
man
sir
that
you
can
depend
on
you
know
just
where
to
find
him
he
is
a
man
that
you
can
tie
to
the
doctor
looked
gratified
at
this
statement
and
listened
with
visible
interest
he
would
have
died
in
the
cause
of
total
abstinence
but
for
colonel
carter
continued
van
zandt
the
colonel
came
in
when
he
was
at
his
lowest
sick
exclaimed
the
doctor
has
he
been
sick
sick
sir
yes
sir
wofully
broken
up
slow
bilious
typhoid
fever
and
would
drink
sir
conscientious
against
it
drink
by
sir
says
the
colonel
must
drink
and
wear
woollen
shirts
says
the
captain
i
drink
and
get
well
my
men
will
drink
and
go
to
hell
by
the
way
those
were
not
his
exact
words
sir
i
am
apt
to
put
a
little
swearing
into
a
story
it
like
lemon
in
a
punch
you
think
so
sir
where
was
i
oh
i
remember
can
i
punish
my
men
says
the
captain
doing
what
i
do
myself
none
of
their
dam
business
what
you
do
says
the
colonel
they
get
drunk
and
neglect
duty
thereby
it
your
business
to
punish
them
and
if
you
neglect
duty
it
my
business
to
punish
you
but
do
suppose
it
is
any
affair
of
your
men
the
idea
is
contrary
to
the
regulations
sir
those
are
the
opinions
of
colonel
carter
sir
an
officer
a
gentleman
and
a
philosopher
nothing
but
good
old
otard
brandy
and
woollen
shirts
brought
the
captain
around
woollen
shirts
and
good
old
otard
brandy
with
the
soule
seal
on
it
he
was
dying
of
bilious
sir
horrible
climate
this
louisiana
but
perhaps
you
are
acquainted
with
it
by
the
way
i
was
speaking
of
colonel
carter
i
believe
knows
how
to
enjoy
himself
he
keeps
the
finest
house
and
most
hospitable
board
in
this
city
he
has
the
prettiest
little
french
he
was
about
to
utter
quite
another
word
but
recollected
himself
in
time
to
substitute
the
word
while
a
saturnine
twinkle
in
his
eye
showed
that
he
felt
the
humor
of
the
misapplication
then
tickled
with
his
own
wit
he
followed
up
the
idea
on
a
broad
grin
i
am
more
envious
of
the
colonel
sir
than
of
his
commission
nothing
like
a
trim
little
french
for
a
bachelor
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
sir
and
understand
me
and
so
on
prattling
meanwhile
pouring
down
the
madeira
the
doctor
who
wanted
to
say
sir
your
goose
has
come
for
you
had
never
before
listened
to
such
garrulity
nor
witnessed
such
thirst
when
colburne
entered
van
zandt
undertook
to
introduce
the
two
although
they
met
each
other
with
extended
hands
and
friendly
inquiries
the
captain
was
somewhat
embarrassed
knowing
that
his
surroundings
were
of
a
nature
to
rouse
suspicion
as
to
the
perfect
virtuousness
of
his
life
and
thinking
perhaps
in
consequence
of
this
knowledge
that
the
doctor
surveyed
him
with
an
investigating
expression
presently
he
turned
his
eyes
on
van
zandt
and
gently
as
they
had
been
toned
by
nature
there
was
now
a
something
in
them
which
visibly
sobered
the
bacchanalian
he
rose
to
his
feet
saluted
as
if
he
were
still
a
private
soldier
and
left
the
room
murmuring
something
about
hurrying
up
dinner
the
doctor
noticed
with
interest
the
authoritative
demeanor
which
had
usurped
the
place
of
the
old
new
boston
innocence
and
where
is
miss
ravenel
was
of
course
one
of
the
first
questions
she
is
in
the
city
was
the
answer
is
it
possible
with
a
tremendous
beating
of
the
heart
yes
you
may
suppose
that
i
could
not
get
her
to
stay
behind
when
it
was
a
question
of
new
orleans
she
is
as
fierce
a
rebel
as
ever
colburne
laughed
with
the
merest
shadow
of
hysteria
in
his
amusement
and
patriot
as
he
was
felt
that
he
hated
miss
ravenel
none
the
worse
for
the
announcement
there
is
a
state
of
the
affections
in
which
every
peculiarity
of
the
loved
object
no
matter
how
offensive
primarily
or
in
itself
becomes
an
additional
charm
people
who
really
like
cats
like
them
all
the
better
for
their
cattishness
a
mother
who
dotes
on
a
deformed
child
takes
an
interest
in
all
lame
children
because
they
remind
her
of
her
own
unfortunate
besides
there
was
no
one
to
leave
her
with
in
new
boston
continued
the
doctor
certainly
assented
colburne
in
a
manifestly
cheerful
humor
but
i
am
truly
sorry
to
see
you
so
thin
and
pale
the
doctor
went
on
you
are
suffering
from
our
horrible
climate
you
positively
must
be
careful
let
me
beg
of
you
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
going
out
in
the
night
air
colburne
could
not
help
laughing
outright
at
the
recommendation
i
dare
say
it
good
advice
said
he
but
when
i
am
officer
of
the
day
i
must
make
my
rounds
after
midnight
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
counsel
which
one
of
our
union
officers
who
was
in
the
siege
of
vicksburg
received
from
his
mother
she
told
him
that
the
air
near
the
ground
is
always
unhealthy
and
urged
him
never
to
sleep
lower
than
the
third
story
this
to
a
man
who
lay
on
the
ground
without
even
a
tent
to
cover
him
war
is
a
dreadful
thing
even
in
its
lesser
details
observed
the
doctor
what
can
i
do
for
you
asked
colburne
after
a
moment
silence
i
really
do
know
at
present
perhaps
much
i
have
come
here
of
course
to
get
together
the
fragments
of
my
property
i
may
be
glad
of
some
introductions
to
the
military
authorities
i
will
do
my
best
for
you
colonel
carter
can
do
more
than
i
can
but
in
the
first
place
you
must
dine
with
me
thank
you
no
i
dine
at
five
with
a
relation
of
mine
dine
twice
then
dine
with
me
first
for
new
boston
sake
you
positively
must
well
if
you
insist
i
am
delighted
of
but
what
a
city
i
must
break
out
with
my
amazement
who
could
have
believed
that
prosperous
gay
bragging
new
orleans
would
come
to
such
grief
and
poverty
i
seem
to
have
walked
through
tyre
and
witnessed
the
fulfillment
of
the
predictions
of
the
prophets
i
have
been
haunted
all
day
by
ezekiel
business
gone
money
gone
population
gone
it
is
the
hand
of
the
almighty
bringing
to
shame
the
counsels
of
wicked
rulers
and
the
predictions
of
lying
seers
i
ask
no
better
proof
than
i
have
seen
that
there
is
a
divine
ruler
i
hope
that
the
whole
land
will
not
have
to
pay
as
heavy
a
price
as
new
orleans
to
be
quit
of
its
compact
with
the
devil
we
are
all
guilty
to
some
extent
the
north
thought
that
it
could
make
money
out
of
slavery
and
yet
evade
the
natural
punishments
of
its
naughty
connivance
it
thought
that
it
could
use
the
south
as
a
catspaw
to
pull
its
chestnuts
out
of
the
fires
of
hell
it
hoped
to
cheat
the
devil
by
doing
its
dirty
business
over
the
shoulders
but
he
is
a
sharp
dealer
he
will
have
his
bond
or
his
pound
of
flesh
none
of
us
ought
to
get
off
easily
and
therefore
i
conclude
that
we
shall
not
now
who
would
suppose
that
the
doctor
had
in
his
mind
all
the
while
a
moral
lecture
to
colburne
yet
so
it
was
for
this
purpose
had
he
gone
back
to
tyre
and
babylon
with
this
object
in
view
had
he
descanted
on
divine
providence
and
the
father
of
evil
it
was
his
manner
to
reprove
and
warn
persons
whom
he
liked
but
not
bluntly
nor
directly
he
touched
them
up
gently
around
the
legs
of
other
people
and
over
the
shoulders
of
events
which
lost
their
personal
interest
to
most
human
beings
thousands
of
years
ago
please
to
notice
how
gradually
delicately
yet
surely
he
descended
upon
colburne
through
epochal
spaces
of
time
and
questions
which
involved
the
guilt
and
punishment
of
continents
just
look
at
this
city
he
continued
merely
in
its
character
as
a
temptation
to
this
army
here
is
a
chance
for
plunder
and
low
dissipation
such
as
most
of
your
simply
educated
and
innocent
country
lads
of
new
england
never
before
imagined
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
is
spoil
enough
here
to
demoralize
a
corps
of
veterans
i
do
believe
that
any
thing
can
be
more
ruinous
to
a
military
force
than
free
licence
to
enrich
itself
at
the
expense
of
a
conquered
enemy
there
is
nobody
so
needed
here
at
this
moment
as
john
the
baptist
you
remember
that
when
the
soldiers
came
unto
him
he
exhorted
them
among
other
things
to
be
content
with
their
wages
i
suppose
the
counsel
was
an
echo
of
the
military
wisdom
of
his
roman
rulers
the
greatest
blessing
that
could
be
vouchsafed
this
army
would
be
to
have
john
the
baptist
crying
night
and
day
in
this
wilderness
of
temptation
be
content
with
your
wages
i
have
hardly
been
here
hours
and
i
have
already
heard
stories
of
cotton
speculations
and
sugar
speculations
as
they
are
slyly
called
yes
and
of
speculations
in
plate
pictures
furniture
and
even
private
clothing
it
is
sure
disgrace
and
probable
ruin
please
to
understand
that
i
am
not
pleading
the
cause
of
the
traitors
who
have
left
their
goods
exposed
to
these
peculations
but
the
cause
of
the
army
which
is
thus
exposed
to
temptation
i
want
to
see
it
subjected
to
the
rules
of
honor
and
common
sense
i
want
it
protected
from
its
opportunities
the
doctor
had
not
alluded
to
plundered
but
mind
reverted
to
the
emptied
bottles
of
yesterday
john
the
baptist
had
not
made
mention
of
this
elegant
little
dwelling
but
this
convicted
legionary
glanced
uneasily
over
its
furniture
and
gimcracks
he
had
not
hitherto
thought
that
he
was
doing
any
thing
irregular
or
immoral
in
his
opinion
he
was
punishing
rebellion
by
using
the
property
of
rebels
for
the
good
or
the
pleasure
of
loyal
citizens
the
subject
had
been
presented
to
him
in
a
new
and
disagreeable
light
but
he
was
too
and
conscientious
not
to
give
it
his
instant
and
serious
consideration
as
for
the
bottles
of
wine
he
might
have
stated
had
he
supposed
it
to
be
worth
while
that
he
had
drunk
only
a
couple
of
glasses
and
that
he
had
quitted
the
orgie
in
disgust
during
its
early
stages
i
dare
say
this
is
all
wrong
he
admitted
unquestionably
if
any
thing
is
confiscated
it
should
be
for
the
direct
and
sole
benefit
of
the
government
there
ought
to
be
a
system
about
it
if
we
occupy
these
houses
we
ought
to
receipt
for
the
furniture
and
be
responsible
for
it
i
wonder
that
something
of
the
sort
is
not
done
but
you
must
remember
charitably
how
green
most
of
us
are
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
in
regard
to
the
laws
of
war
the
rights
of
conquerors
the
discipline
of
armies
and
every
thing
that
pertains
to
a
state
of
hostilities
it
is
very
much
as
if
the
quakers
had
taken
to
fighting
oh
i
do
say
that
i
am
right
answered
the
doctor
i
do
pretend
to
assert
i
only
suggest
i
am
afraid
there
is
occasion
to
offer
apologies
for
my
lieutenant
continued
colburne
a
very
singular
man
i
should
say
eccentric
admitted
the
doctor
charitably
he
annoys
me
a
good
deal
and
yet
he
is
a
valuable
officer
when
he
is
drunk
he
is
the
drunkest
man
since
the
discovery
of
alcohol
he
drunk
you
have
heard
of
men
well
van
zandt
is
something
like
a
thirty
bottle
man
i
do
think
he
has
had
above
two
quarts
of
sherry
this
morning
i
let
him
have
it
to
keep
him
from
swallowing
camphene
or
corrosive
sublimate
but
with
all
his
drink
he
is
one
of
the
best
officers
in
the
regiment
a
good
a
disciplinarian
and
able
to
do
army
business
he
takes
a
load
of
writing
off
my
hands
i
never
saw
such
a
fellow
for
returns
and
other
official
documents
he
turns
them
off
in
a
way
that
reminds
you
of
those
jugglers
who
pull
dozens
of
yards
of
paper
out
of
their
mouths
he
was
once
a
bank
accountant
and
he
has
seen
five
years
in
the
regular
army
that
explains
his
facility
with
the
pen
and
the
musket
then
he
speaks
french
and
spanish
i
believe
he
is
a
reprobate
son
of
a
very
respectable
new
york
family
this
brief
biography
of
van
zandt
furnished
ravenel
the
text
for
a
discourse
on
the
dangers
of
intemperance
illustrated
by
reminiscences
of
new
orleans
society
and
culminating
in
the
assertion
that
of
the
southern
political
leaders
whom
he
remembered
had
died
drunkards
the
doctor
was
more
disposed
than
most
towards
monologue
and
he
had
a
mixture
of
enthusiasm
and
humor
which
made
people
in
general
listen
to
him
patiently
his
present
oration
was
interrupted
by
a
mulatto
lad
who
announced
dinner
the
meal
was
elegantly
cooked
and
served
louisiana
has
inherited
from
its
maternal
france
a
delicate
taste
in
convivial
affairs
and
the
culinary
artist
of
the
occasion
was
he
who
had
formerly
ministered
to
the
instructed
appetites
of
the
rebel
captain
and
his
parisian
affinity
to
colburne
mortification
van
zandt
had
paraded
the
rarest
treasures
of
the
soul√©
hermitage
that
could
not
have
been
bought
then
in
new
york
for
two
dollars
a
bottle
and
madeira
that
was
worth
three
times
as
much
not
to
enlarge
upon
the
champagne
for
the
dessert
and
the
old
otard
brandy
for
the
he
seemed
to
have
got
quite
sober
as
if
by
some
miracle
or
as
if
there
was
a
fresh
van
zandt
always
ready
to
come
on
when
one
got
over
the
bay
and
he
now
recommenced
to
get
himself
drunk
again
he
governed
his
tongue
however
and
behaved
with
good
breeding
evidently
he
was
not
only
grateful
to
colburne
but
stood
in
professional
awe
of
him
as
his
superior
officer
after
dinner
still
amazingly
sober
although
with
ten
or
twenty
dollars
worth
of
wine
in
him
he
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
thundered
out
some
executed
arias
from
popular
operas
four
exclaimed
the
doctor
i
have
just
time
to
get
home
and
see
my
daughter
dine
captain
we
shall
see
you
soon
i
hope
certainly
what
is
the
earliest
time
that
i
can
call
without
inconveniencing
you
any
time
this
evening
the
doctor
bade
van
zandt
a
most
amicable
good
afternoon
but
did
not
ask
him
to
accompany
colburne
in
the
projected
visit
no
sooner
was
he
gone
than
the
captain
turned
upon
the
lieutenant
van
zandt
i
must
beg
you
to
be
extremely
prudent
in
your
language
and
conduct
before
that
gentleman
by
jove
roared
van
zandt
it
came
near
being
the
cursedest
mess
i
have
had
to
pour
down
the
juice
of
the
grape
to
keep
from
fainting
what
is
the
matter
why
parker
brought
his
cousin
here
this
morning
you
heard
of
the
girl
he
calls
his
cousin
she
in
the
now
i
been
so
confoundedly
afraid
you
would
show
him
the
i
been
sweating
with
fright
during
the
whole
dinner
and
all
the
time
looking
as
if
every
thing
was
lovely
and
the
goose
hung
high
she
could
get
out
you
know
the
side
entrance
has
never
been
unlocked
yet
no
key
you
know
what
in
heaven
name
did
you
let
her
in
here
for
demanded
colburne
in
a
passion
why
parker
you
see
i
did
like
to
insult
parker
by
refusing
him
a
favor
he
only
wanted
to
leave
her
while
he
ran
around
to
to
report
something
he
swore
by
all
his
gods
that
he
would
be
gone
an
hour
well
get
her
out
see
that
the
coast
is
clear
and
then
get
her
out
tell
her
she
must
go
and
hereafter
if
any
of
my
brother
officers
want
to
leave
their
cousins
here
remember
sir
to
put
a
veto
on
it
the
perspiration
stood
on
his
brow
at
the
mere
thought
of
what
might
have
been
the
doctor
suspicions
if
he
had
gone
into
the
van
zandt
went
about
his
delicate
errand
with
a
very
meek
and
sheepish
grace
when
he
had
accomplished
it
colburne
called
him
into
the
and
held
the
following
catonian
discourse
van
zandt
i
want
you
to
take
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
of
the
house
and
the
contents
of
the
so
that
when
i
leave
here
i
can
satisfy
myself
that
not
a
single
article
is
missing
we
shall
leave
soon
i
shall
make
application
to
have
my
company
quartered
in
the
or
in
tents
in
one
of
the
squares
upon
my
honor
captain
remonstrated
the
dismayed
van
zandt
i
pledge
you
my
word
of
honor
that
nothing
of
this
kind
shall
happen
again
he
cast
a
desperate
glare
around
the
luxurious
rooms
and
gave
a
mournful
thought
to
the
now
forbidden
paradise
of
the
and
i
give
you
mine
to
the
same
effect
answered
the
captain
the
debauch
of
yesterday
answers
my
purpose
as
a
warning
and
i
mean
to
get
out
of
temptation
for
my
sake
and
yours
besides
this
is
no
way
for
soldiers
to
live
it
is
poor
preparation
for
the
field
more
than
half
of
our
officers
are
in
barracks
or
tents
i
am
as
able
and
ought
to
be
as
willing
to
bear
it
as
they
make
your
preparations
to
leave
here
at
the
shortest
notice
and
meantime
remember
if
you
please
the
inventory
the
company
clerk
can
assist
you
poor
van
zandt
who
was
a
luxurious
brute
able
to
endure
any
hardship
but
equally
able
to
revel
in
any
sybaritism
set
about
his
unwelcome
task
with
a
obedience
i
do
not
wish
to
be
understood
by
the
way
as
insinuating
that
all
or
even
many
of
our
officers
then
stationed
in
new
orleans
were
given
up
to
plunder
and
debauchery
i
only
wish
to
present
an
idea
of
the
temptations
of
the
place
and
to
show
how
our
friend
colburne
could
resist
them
with
some
aid
from
the
doctor
and
perhaps
more
from
miss
ravenel
as
the
doctor
walked
homeward
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
for
a
handkerchief
to
wipe
his
brow
and
discovered
a
paper
it
was
letter
to
him
and
he
read
it
through
as
he
strolled
onward
how
singular
he
said
he
does
even
mention
that
he
has
been
sick
he
is
a
noble
fellow
the
doctor
was
too
fond
of
the
young
man
to
allow
his
faith
in
him
to
be
easily
shaken
chapter
xi
new
orleans
life
and
new
orleans
ladies
from
these
chapters
all
about
men
i
return
with
pleasure
to
my
young
lady
rebel
though
she
is
before
she
had
been
hours
in
new
orleans
she
discovered
that
it
was
by
no
means
so
delightful
a
place
as
of
old
and
she
had
become
quite
indignant
at
the
federals
to
whom
she
attributed
all
this
gloom
and
desolation
why
not
adam
and
eve
were
well
enough
until
the
angel
of
the
lord
drove
them
out
of
paradise
the
felon
has
no
unusual
troubles
so
far
as
he
can
see
except
those
which
are
raised
for
him
by
the
malignity
of
judges
and
the
sheriff
miss
ravenel
was
informed
by
the
few
citizens
whom
she
met
that
new
orleans
was
doing
bravely
until
the
united
states
government
illegally
blocked
up
the
river
and
then
piratically
seized
the
city
frightening
away
its
inhabitants
and
paralyzing
its
business
and
nullifying
its
prosperity
one
old
gentleman
assured
her
that
farragut
and
butler
had
behaved
in
the
most
unconstitutional
manner
at
all
events
somebody
had
spoiled
the
gayety
of
the
place
and
she
was
quite
miserable
and
even
pettish
about
it
is
it
dreadful
she
said
bursting
into
tears
as
she
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
her
aunt
larue
who
occupying
the
next
house
had
rushed
in
to
receive
the
restored
exile
she
had
few
sympathies
with
this
relation
and
never
before
felt
a
desire
to
overflow
into
her
bosom
but
any
face
which
had
been
familiar
to
her
in
the
happy
times
was
a
passport
to
her
sympathies
in
this
hour
of
affliction
effrayant
replied
larue
but
you
are
out
of
fashion
to
weep
we
have
given
over
that
feminine
weakness
that
fountain
is
dry
the
inhumanities
of
these
yankee
vandals
have
driven
us
into
a
despair
too
profound
for
tears
we
do
not
flatter
beast
butler
with
a
sob
although
she
talked
so
strongly
she
did
not
seem
more
than
half
in
earnest
a
half
smile
lurked
around
her
lips
of
deep
and
her
bright
black
eyes
sparkled
with
interest
rather
than
with
passion
by
the
way
she
was
not
a
venerable
personage
and
not
properly
lillie
aunt
but
only
the
widow
of
the
late
ravenel
brother
not
more
than
years
of
age
and
still
decidedly
pretty
her
complexion
was
dark
pale
and
a
little
too
thick
but
it
was
relieved
by
the
jet
black
of
her
regular
and
of
her
masses
of
wavy
hair
her
face
was
oval
her
nose
straight
her
lips
thin
but
nicely
modeled
her
chin
little
and
dimpled
her
expression
was
generally
gay
and
coquettish
but
amazingly
variable
and
capable
of
running
through
a
vast
gamut
of
sentiments
including
affection
melancholy
and
piety
though
short
she
was
well
built
with
a
deep
healthy
chest
splendid
arms
and
finely
turned
ankles
she
did
not
strike
a
careless
observer
as
handsome
but
she
bore
close
examination
with
advantage
the
doctor
instinctively
suspected
her
did
not
think
her
a
safe
woman
to
have
about
although
he
could
allege
no
overtly
wicked
act
against
her
and
had
brought
up
lillie
to
be
shy
of
her
society
nevertheless
it
was
impossible
just
now
to
keep
her
at
a
distance
for
he
would
probably
be
much
away
from
home
and
it
was
necessary
to
leave
his
daughter
with
some
one
in
politics
if
not
in
other
things
larue
was
as
as
janus
to
undoubted
secessionists
she
talked
bitterly
coarsely
scandalously
against
the
northerners
if
advisable
she
could
go
on
about
picayune
butler
beast
butler
traitor
farragut
vandal
yankees
heroes
mudsills
nasty
tinkers
amalgamationists
from
nine
in
the
morning
when
she
got
up
till
midnight
when
she
went
to
bed
at
the
same
time
she
could
call
in
a
quiet
way
on
the
mayor
or
the
commanding
general
to
wheedle
protection
out
of
them
by
playing
her
fine
eyes
and
smiling
and
flattering
knowing
the
bad
social
repute
of
the
ravenels
as
unionists
she
would
not
invite
them
into
her
own
roomy
house
but
she
was
pleased
to
have
them
in
their
own
dwelling
next
door
because
they
might
at
a
pinch
serve
her
as
friends
at
the
butler
court
on
the
principle
of
justice
to
satan
i
must
say
that
she
was
no
fair
sample
of
the
proud
and
slaveholding
aristocracy
of
louisiana
neither
was
she
one
of
the
patriotic
and
puritan
few
who
shared
the
doctor
sympathies
and
principles
as
she
came
of
an
old
french
creole
family
and
her
husband
had
been
a
lawyer
of
note
and
an
ultra
southern
politician
she
belonged
like
the
ravenels
to
the
patrician
order
of
new
orleans
only
that
she
was
counted
among
the
soul√©
set
while
her
relatives
had
gone
over
to
the
barker
faction
she
had
not
been
reduced
to
beggary
by
the
advent
of
the
yankees
her
estate
was
not
in
the
now
worthless
investments
of
negroes
plantations
steamboats
or
railroads
but
in
bank
stock
and
the
new
orleans
banks
though
robbed
of
their
specie
by
the
flying
lovell
still
made
their
paper
pass
and
commanded
a
market
for
their
shares
but
larue
was
disturbed
lest
she
might
in
some
unforeseen
manner
follow
the
general
rush
to
ruin
and
thus
in
respect
to
the
vandal
invaders
she
was
at
once
a
little
timorous
and
a
little
savage
the
conversation
between
niece
and
youthful
aunt
was
interrupted
by
a
call
from
and
miss
langdon
two
stern
thin
pale
ladies
in
black
without
hoops
highly
aristocratic
and
inexorably
rebellious
they
started
when
they
saw
the
young
lady
then
recovered
themselves
and
looked
on
her
with
unacquainted
eyes
miss
larue
made
haste
smiling
inwardly
to
introduce
her
cousin
miss
ravenel
ah
indeed
miss
ravenel
they
remembered
having
met
miss
ravenel
formerly
but
really
they
had
not
expected
to
see
her
in
new
orleans
they
supposed
that
she
had
taken
up
her
residence
at
the
north
with
her
father
lillie
trembled
with
mortification
and
colored
with
anger
she
felt
with
a
shock
that
sentence
of
social
ostracism
had
been
passed
upon
her
because
of
her
father
fidelity
to
the
union
was
this
the
reward
that
her
love
for
her
native
city
her
defence
of
louisiana
in
the
midst
of
had
deserved
was
she
to
be
ignored
cut
satirized
because
she
was
her
father
daughter
she
rebelled
in
spirit
against
such
injustice
and
cruelty
and
remained
silent
simply
expressing
her
feelings
by
a
haughty
bow
she
disdained
to
enter
upon
any
she
perceived
that
she
could
not
without
passing
judgment
upon
her
much
adored
papa
and
finally
she
knew
that
she
was
too
tremulous
to
speak
with
good
effect
the
langdons
and
larue
proceeded
to
discuss
affairs
political
metaphorically
tying
beast
butler
to
a
flaming
stake
and
performing
a
scalp
dance
around
it
making
a
drinking
cup
of
his
skull
quaffing
from
it
refreshing
draughts
of
yankee
blood
lillie
remembered
that
disagreeably
loyal
as
the
new
boston
ladies
were
she
had
not
heard
from
their
lips
any
such
conversational
atrocities
she
did
not
sympathize
much
when
langdon
entered
on
a
lyrical
recital
of
her
own
wrongs
and
sorrows
she
was
sorry
indeed
to
hear
that
young
fred
langdon
had
been
killed
at
fort
jackson
but
then
the
mother
expressed
such
a
fury
for
revenge
as
quite
shocked
and
rather
disgusted
our
heroine
and
moreover
she
could
not
forget
how
coolly
she
had
been
treated
merely
because
she
was
her
dear
father
daughter
she
actually
felt
inclined
to
laugh
satirically
when
the
two
visitors
proceeded
to
relate
jointly
and
with
a
species
of
solemn
ferocity
how
they
had
that
morning
snubbed
a
yankee
officer
the
brute
got
up
and
offered
us
his
seat
in
the
cars
i
did
look
at
him
neither
of
us
looked
at
him
i
said
we
both
said
accept
nothing
from
yankees
i
remained
we
both
remained
standing
such
was
the
mild
substance
of
the
narrative
but
it
was
horrible
in
the
telling
with
fierce
little
hisses
and
glares
sticking
out
from
it
like
quills
of
the
fretful
porcupine
miss
ravenel
did
not
sympathize
with
the
conduct
of
the
fair
snubbers
and
i
fear
also
that
she
desired
to
make
them
feel
uncomfortable
really
she
observed
i
think
it
was
right
civil
in
him
to
give
up
his
seat
i
did
know
that
they
were
so
polite
i
thought
they
treated
the
citizens
with
all
sorts
of
indignities
to
this
the
langdons
vouchsafed
no
reply
except
by
rising
and
taking
their
departure
miss
ravenel
they
said
so
surprised
ever
to
have
seen
you
in
new
orleans
again
nor
did
they
ask
her
to
visit
them
as
they
very
urgently
did
larue
it
seemed
likely
to
lillie
that
she
would
not
find
life
in
new
orleans
so
pleasant
as
she
had
expected
half
her
old
friends
had
disappeared
and
the
other
half
had
turned
to
enemies
she
was
to
be
cut
in
the
street
to
be
glared
at
in
church
to
be
sneered
at
in
the
parlor
to
be
put
on
the
defensive
to
be
obliged
to
fight
for
herself
and
her
father
her
temper
rose
at
the
thought
of
such
undeserved
hardness
and
she
felt
that
if
it
continued
long
she
should
turn
loyal
for
very
spite
doctor
ravenel
returning
from
his
interview
with
colburne
met
the
langdon
ladies
in
the
hall
and
although
they
hardly
nodded
waited
on
them
to
the
outer
door
with
his
habitual
politeness
lillie
caught
a
glimpse
of
this
from
the
parlor
and
was
infuriated
by
their
incivility
and
his
lack
of
resentment
did
they
speak
to
you
papa
she
cried
running
to
him
then
i
would
have
let
them
find
their
own
way
out
what
are
you
so
patient
for
my
dear
i
am
merely
following
the
christian
example
set
me
by
these
low
yankees
whom
we
all
hate
so
said
papa
smiling
i
have
seen
a
couple
of
officers
shamefully
insulted
by
a
woman
who
calls
herself
a
lady
they
returned
not
a
word
not
even
a
look
of
retaliation
yes
but
replied
lillie
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
concluded
i
would
stand
it
we
must
have
some
consideration
too
for
people
who
have
lost
relatives
lost
property
lost
all
however
their
folly
may
have
deserved
punishment
hav
lost
property
snapped
the
young
lady
do
you
ask
for
the
sake
of
argument
or
for
information
well
i
should
really
like
to
know
yes
for
information
said
lillie
deciding
to
give
up
the
argument
which
was
likely
to
be
perplexing
to
a
person
who
had
feelings
on
both
sides
our
railroad
property
stated
the
doctor
wo
be
worth
much
until
it
is
recovered
from
the
hands
of
the
rebels
but
that
is
nearly
all
our
property
except
this
house
yes
except
the
house
but
how
are
we
to
live
in
the
house
without
money
my
dear
let
us
trust
god
to
provide
i
hope
to
be
so
guided
as
to
discover
something
to
do
i
have
found
a
friend
captain
colburne
will
be
here
this
evening
oh
will
he
said
the
young
lady
blushing
with
pleasure
it
would
be
delightful
to
see
any
amicable
visage
in
this
city
of
enemies
and
moreover
she
had
never
disputed
that
captain
colburne
though
a
yankee
was
gentlemanly
and
agreeable
she
had
even
admitted
that
he
was
handsome
though
not
so
handsome
as
colonel
carter
larue
was
also
gratified
at
the
prospect
of
a
male
visitor
as
sam
weller
might
have
phrased
it
had
he
known
the
lady
a
man
was
larue
particular
wanity
the
kitchen
department
of
the
ravenels
not
being
yet
organized
they
dined
that
day
with
their
relative
the
meal
over
they
went
to
their
own
house
lillie
to
attend
to
housekeeping
duties
and
the
doctor
to
forget
all
trouble
in
a
box
of
minerals
lillie
last
words
to
larue
had
been
you
must
spend
the
evening
with
us
this
captain
colburne
is
right
pleasant
is
he
we
will
bring
him
over
to
the
right
side
when
he
gives
up
the
blue
uniform
for
the
grey
i
shall
adore
him
i
do
think
he
will
change
his
coat
easily
in
her
own
house
she
continued
to
think
of
the
captain
coat
and
then
of
another
coat
the
same
in
color
but
with
two
rows
of
buttons
who
did
you
see
out
papa
she
asked
presently
who
did
i
see
out
colburne
as
i
told
you
nobody
else
papa
i
do
recollect
he
said
as
he
settled
himself
to
a
microscopic
contemplation
of
a
bit
of
do
wrinkle
up
your
forehead
so
i
wish
you
would
it
makes
you
look
old
enough
to
have
come
over
with
christopher
columbus
it
was
a
part
of
her
adoration
of
her
father
that
she
could
not
bear
to
see
in
him
the
least
symptoms
of
increasing
age
i
do
think
that
i
saw
a
single
old
acquaintance
said
the
doctor
rubbing
his
head
thoughtfully
it
is
astonishing
how
the
high
and
mighty
ones
have
disappeared
from
this
city
where
they
used
to
suppose
that
they
defied
the
civilized
world
the
barbarians
did
know
what
the
civilized
world
could
do
to
them
the
conceited
braggadocia
of
new
orleans
a
year
ago
is
a
most
comical
reminiscence
now
in
the
midst
of
its
speechless
terror
and
submission
one
ca
help
thinking
of
frogs
sitting
around
their
own
puddle
and
trying
to
fill
the
universe
with
their
roarings
some
urchin
throws
a
stone
into
the
puddle
you
see
fifty
pairs
of
legs
twinkle
in
the
air
and
the
uproar
is
followed
by
silence
it
was
just
so
here
the
united
states
pitched
farragut
and
butler
into
the
puddle
of
secession
and
all
our
political
roarers
dived
out
of
sight
many
of
them
are
still
here
but
they
keep
their
noses
under
water
by
the
way
i
did
see
two
of
my
old
students
bradley
and
john
akers
bradley
told
me
that
the
rebel
authorities
maintained
a
pretence
of
victory
until
the
last
moment
probably
in
order
to
keep
the
populace
quiet
while
they
got
themselves
and
their
property
out
of
the
city
he
was
actually
reading
an
official
bulletin
stating
that
the
yankee
fleet
had
been
sunk
in
passing
the
forts
when
he
heard
the
bang
bang
bang
of
farragut
cannonade
at
chalmette
akers
was
himself
at
chalmette
he
says
that
the
hartford
came
slowly
around
the
bend
below
the
fort
with
a
most
provoking
composure
they
immediately
opened
on
her
with
all
their
artillery
she
made
no
reply
and
began
to
turn
they
thought
she
was
about
to
run
away
and
hurrahed
lustily
suddenly
whang
crash
she
sent
her
whole
broadside
into
them
akers
says
that
not
a
man
of
them
waited
for
a
second
salute
they
started
for
the
woods
in
a
body
at
full
speed
he
never
saw
such
running
their
heels
twinkled
like
the
heels
of
the
frog
that
i
spoke
of
but
they
made
a
good
fight
at
the
forts
papa
my
dear
the
devil
makes
a
good
fight
against
his
maker
but
it
small
credit
to
him
it
only
proves
his
amazing
stupidity
papa
said
lillie
after
a
few
minutes
of
silence
i
think
you
might
let
those
stones
alone
and
take
me
out
to
walk
my
child
it
is
nearly
sunset
now
and
colburne
may
come
early
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
laid
aside
his
minerals
and
picked
up
his
hat
where
are
you
going
demanded
lillie
eagerly
and
almost
pettishly
it
was
a
question
that
she
never
failed
to
put
to
him
in
that
same
tone
every
time
that
he
essayed
to
leave
her
she
did
not
want
him
to
go
out
unless
she
went
in
his
company
if
he
would
go
it
was
when
will
you
come
back
and
when
he
returned
it
was
where
have
you
been
and
who
did
you
see
and
what
did
he
say
never
was
a
child
so
haunted
by
a
pet
sheep
or
a
handsome
husband
by
a
plain
wife
as
was
this
charming
papa
by
his
doating
daughter
i
am
going
to
elderkin
said
ravenel
i
hear
that
he
has
been
kind
enough
to
store
my
electrical
machine
during
our
absence
he
was
out
when
i
called
on
him
this
morning
but
he
was
to
be
at
home
by
six
this
evening
i
am
anxious
to
see
the
machine
oh
papa
do
how
can
you
be
so
addled
about
your
sciences
you
are
just
like
a
little
boy
come
home
from
a
visit
and
pulling
over
his
playthings
do
let
the
machine
go
till
my
dear
consider
how
costly
a
plaything
it
is
i
could
replace
it
for
five
hundred
dollars
when
will
you
come
back
demanded
lillie
by
seven
at
the
latest
bring
in
larue
to
help
entertain
captain
colburne
and
be
sure
to
ask
him
to
wait
for
me
when
he
quitted
the
house
lillie
went
to
the
window
and
watched
him
until
he
was
out
of
sight
she
always
had
a
childish
aversion
to
being
left
alone
and
solitude
was
now
particularly
objectionable
to
her
so
forsaken
did
she
feel
in
this
city
where
she
had
once
been
so
happy
after
a
time
she
remembered
captain
colburne
and
the
social
duties
of
a
state
of
young
ladyhood
she
hurried
to
her
room
lighted
both
turned
their
full
luminosity
on
the
mirror
loosened
up
the
flossy
waves
of
her
blonde
hair
tied
on
a
pink
and
then
a
blue
one
considered
gravely
as
to
which
was
the
most
becoming
and
finally
took
a
profile
view
of
the
effect
by
means
of
a
prinking
and
turning
and
adjusting
her
plumage
like
a
canary
she
was
conscientiously
aware
you
perceive
of
her
obligation
to
put
herself
in
suitable
condition
to
please
the
eye
of
a
visitor
she
was
not
a
learned
woman
nor
an
unpleasantly
one
but
an
average
young
lady
of
good
breeding
just
such
as
most
men
fall
in
love
with
who
wanted
social
success
and
depended
for
it
upon
pretty
looks
and
pleasant
ways
by
the
time
that
these
private
devoirs
were
accomplished
larue
entered
bearing
marks
of
having
given
her
person
a
similar
amount
of
fastidious
attention
each
of
these
ladies
saw
what
the
other
had
been
about
but
neither
thought
of
being
surprised
or
amused
at
it
to
their
minds
such
preparation
was
perfectly
natural
and
womanly
and
they
would
have
deemed
the
absence
of
it
a
gross
piece
of
untidiness
and
boorishness
larue
put
lillie
blue
a
little
more
off
her
forehead
and
lillie
smoothed
out
an
almost
imperceptible
wrinkle
in
larue
i
am
not
positively
sure
indeed
that
were
then
worn
but
i
am
willing
to
take
my
oath
that
some
small
office
of
the
kind
was
rendered
of
course
it
would
be
agreeable
to
have
a
scene
here
between
colburne
and
miss
ravenel
some
burning
words
to
tell
some
thrilling
looks
to
describe
such
as
might
show
how
they
stood
with
regard
to
each
other
something
which
would
visibly
advance
both
these
young
but
they
behaved
in
a
disappointingly
manner
and
entirely
refrained
from
turning
their
feelings
wrong
side
outwards
with
the
exception
of
miss
ravenel
inveterate
blush
and
of
a
slightly
unnatural
rapidity
of
utterance
in
captain
colburne
they
met
like
a
young
lady
and
gentleman
who
were
on
excellent
terms
and
had
not
seen
each
other
for
a
month
or
two
this
is
not
the
way
that
heroes
and
heroines
meet
on
the
boards
or
in
some
romances
but
in
actual
human
society
they
frequently
balk
our
expectations
in
just
this
manner
considered
real
life
is
frequently
a
failure
you
do
know
how
pleasant
it
is
to
me
to
meet
you
and
your
father
said
colburne
it
seems
like
new
boston
over
again
the
time
during
which
he
had
known
the
ravenels
at
new
boston
was
now
a
pasture
of
very
delightful
things
to
his
memory
it
is
pleasant
to
me
because
it
seems
like
new
orleans
laughed
miss
lillie
no
not
much
like
new
orleans
either
she
added
it
used
to
be
so
gay
and
amusing
you
have
made
an
awfully
sad
place
of
it
with
your
patriotic
invasion
it
is
bad
to
take
medicine
he
replied
but
it
is
better
to
take
it
than
to
stay
sick
if
you
will
have
the
to
live
ten
years
longer
you
will
see
new
orleans
more
prosperous
and
lively
than
ever
i
sha
like
it
so
well
we
shall
be
nobodies
our
old
friends
will
be
driven
out
and
there
will
be
a
new
set
who
wo
know
us
that
depends
on
yourselves
they
will
be
glad
to
know
you
if
you
will
let
them
i
understand
that
the
napoleonic
aristocracy
courts
the
old
oligarchy
of
the
faubourg
germain
it
will
be
like
that
here
i
presume
larue
had
at
first
remained
silent
playing
off
a
pretty
little
game
of
shyness
but
seeing
that
the
young
people
had
nothing
special
to
say
to
each
other
she
gave
way
to
her
sociable
instincts
and
joined
in
the
conversation
captain
colburne
i
will
promise
to
live
the
ten
years
she
said
i
want
to
see
new
orleans
a
metropolis
we
have
failed
you
shall
succeed
and
i
will
admire
your
success
the
patriotic
young
soldier
looked
frankly
gratified
he
concluded
that
the
lady
was
one
of
the
unionists
of
the
south
a
race
then
really
about
as
extinct
as
the
dodo
but
devoutly
believed
in
by
the
sanguine
masses
of
the
north
and
of
which
our
officers
at
new
orleans
were
consequently
much
in
search
he
began
to
talk
gaily
pushing
his
hair
up
as
usual
when
in
good
spirits
and
laughing
heartily
at
the
slightest
approach
to
wit
whether
made
by
himself
or
another
some
people
thought
that
colburne
laughed
too
much
for
thorough
good
breeding
i
feel
quite
weighted
by
what
you
expect
he
said
i
want
to
go
to
work
immediately
and
build
a
brick
and
plaster
like
ours
in
new
boston
i
suppose
every
metropolis
must
have
a
but
you
must
expect
too
much
of
me
you
must
watch
me
too
close
i
shall
want
to
sleep
occasionally
in
the
ten
years
we
shall
look
to
see
you
here
from
time
to
time
rejoined
larue
you
may
be
sure
that
i
sha
forget
that
there
are
other
reasons
for
it
besides
my
admiration
for
your
loyal
sentiments
said
colburne
attempting
a
compliment
one
projectile
for
each
lady
at
that
imputation
of
loyal
sentiments
lillie
could
hardly
restrain
a
laugh
but
larue
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
bowed
and
smiled
graciously
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
continued
that
most
of
the
ladies
of
new
orleans
seem
to
regard
us
with
a
perfect
hatred
when
i
pass
them
in
the
street
they
draw
themselves
aside
in
such
a
way
that
i
look
in
the
first
attainable
mirror
to
see
if
i
have
the
they
are
dreadfully
sensitive
to
the
presence
of
yankees
they
remind
me
of
the
catarrhal
gentleman
who
sneezed
every
time
an
drove
by
his
house
seriously
they
abuse
us
i
was
dreadfully
set
down
by
a
couple
of
women
in
black
this
morning
they
entered
a
street
car
in
which
i
was
there
were
several
citizens
present
but
not
one
of
them
offered
to
give
up
his
place
i
rose
and
offered
them
mine
they
no
more
took
it
than
if
they
knew
that
i
had
scalped
all
their
relatives
they
surveyed
me
from
head
to
foot
with
a
lofty
scorn
which
made
them
seem
fifty
feet
high
and
fifty
years
old
to
my
terrified
optics
they
hissed
out
accept
nothing
from
yankees
and
remained
standing
the
hiss
would
have
done
honor
to
rachel
or
to
the
geese
who
saved
rome
the
two
listeners
laughed
and
exchanged
a
glance
of
comprehension
offer
them
your
hand
and
heart
and
see
if
they
wo
accept
something
from
a
yankee
said
larue
colburne
looked
a
trifle
disconcerted
and
because
he
did
so
miss
ravenel
blushed
in
both
these
young
persons
there
was
a
susceptibility
a
promptness
to
take
alarm
with
regard
to
hymenial
subjects
which
indicated
at
least
that
they
considered
themselves
old
enough
to
marry
each
other
or
somebody
whether
the
event
would
ever
happen
or
not
i
suppose
miss
ravenel
thinks
i
was
served
perfectly
right
observed
colburne
if
i
see
her
standing
in
a
street
car
and
offer
her
my
seat
i
suppose
she
will
say
something
crushing
he
preferred
you
see
to
talk
apropos
of
miss
ravenel
rather
than
of
larue
or
the
langdons
please
do
fail
to
try
me
observed
lillie
i
hate
to
stand
up
unless
it
is
to
dance
as
colburne
had
not
been
permitted
to
learn
dancing
in
his
younger
days
and
had
felt
ashamed
to
undertake
it
in
what
seemed
to
him
his
present
fullness
of
years
he
had
nothing
to
say
on
the
new
idea
suggested
the
speech
even
made
him
feel
a
little
uneasy
it
sounded
like
an
implication
that
miss
ravenel
preferred
men
who
danced
to
men
who
did
not
so
fastidiously
jealous
and
sensitive
are
people
who
are
ever
so
slightly
in
love
in
this
wandering
and
superficial
way
the
conversation
rippled
along
for
nearly
an
hour
colburne
had
been
nonplussed
from
the
beginning
by
not
finding
his
young
lady
alone
and
not
being
able
therefore
to
say
to
her
at
least
a
few
of
the
affecting
things
which
were
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
arrived
at
the
house
full
of
pleasant
emotion
believing
that
he
should
certainly
overflow
with
warm
expressions
of
friendship
if
he
did
not
absolutely
pour
forth
a
torrent
of
passionate
affection
larue
had
dropped
among
his
agreeable
bubbles
of
expectation
like
a
piece
of
ice
into
a
goblet
of
champagne
taking
the
life
and
effervescence
out
of
the
generous
fluid
he
was
occupied
not
so
much
in
talking
or
listening
as
in
cogitating
how
he
could
bring
the
conversation
into
congeniality
with
his
own
feelings
by
the
way
if
he
had
found
miss
ravenel
alone
i
doubt
whether
he
would
have
dared
say
any
thing
to
her
of
a
startling
nature
he
her
and
was
afraid
of
her
he
himself
and
was
too
modest
lillie
had
repeatedly
wondered
to
herself
why
her
father
did
not
come
at
last
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
exclaimed
with
anxious
astonishment
half
past
eight
why
victorine
where
can
papa
be
at
doctor
elderkin
without
doubt
once
that
two
men
commence
on
the
politics
they
know
not
how
to
finish
i
do
believe
it
said
the
girl
with
the
unreasonableness
common
to
affectionate
people
when
they
are
anxious
about
the
person
they
like
i
do
believe
he
is
staying
there
so
long
i
am
afraid
something
has
happened
to
him
he
said
he
would
certainly
be
back
by
half
past
seven
he
relied
on
seeing
captain
colburne
i
really
am
very
anxious
the
city
is
in
such
a
dreadful
state
i
will
go
and
inquire
for
him
offered
colburne
where
is
doctor
elderkin
oh
my
dear
captain
do
think
of
it
objected
larue
you
a
federal
officer
you
would
really
be
in
danger
in
the
streets
at
night
in
this
unguarded
part
of
the
city
you
would
certainly
catch
harm
from
our
yourself
cousin
lillie
your
father
a
citizen
is
in
no
peril
larue
really
believed
that
the
doctor
ran
little
risk
but
her
main
object
in
talking
was
to
start
an
interest
between
herself
and
the
young
officer
he
smiled
at
the
idea
of
his
being
attacked
and
disregarding
the
aunt
looked
to
the
niece
for
orders
miss
ravenel
thought
that
he
hesitated
through
fear
of
the
and
gave
him
a
glance
of
impatience
bordering
disagreeably
close
on
anger
smarting
under
the
injustice
of
this
look
he
said
quietly
i
will
bring
you
some
news
before
long
inquired
the
way
to
the
elderkin
house
and
went
out
at
the
first
turning
he
came
upon
a
man
sitting
on
a
flight
of
steps
and
wiping
from
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
something
which
showed
like
blood
in
the
gaslight
is
that
you
doctor
he
said
are
you
hurt
what
has
happened
i
have
been
some
blackguard
struck
with
a
bludgeon
i
think
colburne
picked
up
his
hat
aided
in
bandaging
a
cut
on
the
forehead
and
offered
his
arm
it
does
look
very
bad
does
it
said
ravenel
i
thought
not
my
hat
broke
the
force
of
the
blow
but
still
it
prostrated
me
i
am
really
very
much
obliged
to
you
have
you
any
idea
who
it
was
not
the
least
oh
it
only
an
ordinary
new
orleans
salutation
i
knew
i
was
in
new
orleans
when
i
was
hit
just
as
the
shipwrecked
man
knew
he
was
in
a
christian
country
when
he
saw
a
gallows
you
take
it
very
coolly
sir
you
would
make
a
good
soldier
i
belong
in
the
city
it
is
one
of
our
pretty
ways
to
brain
people
by
surprise
i
never
had
it
happen
to
me
before
but
i
have
always
contemplated
the
possibility
of
it
i
was
in
the
least
astonished
how
lucky
i
had
on
that
deformity
of
civilization
a
stiff
beaver
i
will
wear
nothing
but
beavers
henceforward
i
swear
allegiance
to
them
as
baillie
jarvie
did
to
guid
braidcloth
a
brass
helmet
would
be
still
better
somebody
ought
to
get
up
a
dress
hat
of
aluminum
for
the
new
orleans
market
oh
papa
screamed
lillie
when
she
saw
him
enter
on
colburne
arm
his
hat
smashed
his
face
pale
and
a
streak
of
blood
down
the
bridge
of
his
nose
she
was
the
whitest
of
the
two
and
needed
the
most
attention
for
a
minute
larue
excited
colburne
admiration
by
the
cool
efficiency
with
which
she
exerted
herself
bringing
water
sponges
and
bandages
washing
the
cut
binding
it
up
artistically
and
finishing
the
treatment
with
a
glass
of
sherry
her
late
husband
used
to
be
brought
home
occasionally
in
similar
condition
except
that
he
took
his
sherry
and
a
great
deal
of
it
too
in
advance
it
was
one
of
those
detestable
soldiers
exclaimed
lillie
no
my
dear
said
the
doctor
it
was
one
of
our
own
excellent
people
they
are
so
ardent
and
impulsive
you
know
they
have
the
southern
heart
always
fired
up
it
was
some
old
acquaintance
you
may
depend
although
i
did
not
recognize
him
as
he
struck
me
he
said
that
you
federal
spy
he
added
an
epithet
that
i
do
care
to
repeat
not
believing
that
it
applies
to
me
i
think
he
would
have
renewed
the
attack
but
for
the
approach
of
some
one
probably
captain
colburne
you
owe
him
a
word
of
thanks
lillie
particularly
after
what
you
have
said
about
soldiers
the
young
lady
held
out
her
hand
to
the
captain
with
an
impulse
of
gratitude
and
compunction
he
took
it
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
stooping
and
kissing
it
whereupon
her
white
face
flushed
instantaneously
to
a
crimson
larue
smiled
knowingly
and
said
that
is
very
french
captain
you
will
do
admirably
for
new
orleans
he
does
know
all
the
pretty
manners
and
customs
of
the
place
remarked
the
doctor
who
was
not
evidently
displeased
at
the
kiss
he
has
yet
learned
to
knock
down
elderly
gentlemen
because
they
disagree
with
him
in
politics
they
are
awfully
at
the
north
larue
in
those
social
graces
the
mudsill
sumner
was
too
unpolished
to
think
of
clubbing
the
brains
out
of
the
gentleman
brooks
he
boorishly
undertook
to
settle
a
question
of
right
and
justice
by
argument
you
talk
so
much
papa
urged
lillie
you
ought
to
go
to
bed
colburne
bade
them
good
evening
but
on
reaching
the
door
stopped
and
said
do
you
feel
safe
here
lillie
looked
grateful
and
wishful
as
though
she
would
have
liked
a
guard
but
the
doctor
answered
oh
perfectly
safe
as
far
as
concerns
that
fellow
he
ran
off
too
much
frightened
to
attempt
any
thing
more
at
present
so
much
obliged
to
you
nevertheless
a
patrol
of
the
tenth
barataria
did
arrive
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ravenel
mansion
during
the
night
and
scoured
the
streets
till
daybreak
arresting
every
man
who
carried
a
cane
and
could
not
give
a
good
account
of
himself
in
a
general
way
new
orleans
was
a
safer
place
in
these
times
than
it
had
been
before
since
it
was
a
village
i
may
as
well
say
here
that
the
perpetrator
of
this
assault
was
not
discovered
and
that
the
adventure
had
no
results
except
a
day
or
two
of
headache
to
the
doctor
and
a
considerable
progress
in
the
conversion
of
miss
ravenel
from
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
women
especially
women
offended
in
the
persons
of
those
whom
they
love
are
so
terribly
illogical
if
secretary
seward
with
all
his
constitutional
lore
and
persuasive
eloquence
had
argued
with
her
for
three
weeks
he
could
not
have
converted
her
but
the
moment
a
southern
ruffian
knocked
her
father
on
the
head
she
began
to
see
that
secession
was
indefensible
and
that
the
american
union
ought
to
be
preserved
it
was
a
mere
sporadic
outbreak
of
our
local
observed
ravenel
speaking
of
the
outrage
the
man
had
no
designs
no
permanent
malice
he
merely
took
advantage
of
a
charming
opportunity
he
saw
a
loyal
head
within
reach
of
his
bludgeon
and
he
instinctively
made
a
clutch
at
it
the
finest
gentlemen
of
the
city
would
have
done
as
much
under
the
same
temptation
chapter
xii
colonel
carter
befriends
the
ravenels
captain
colburne
indulged
in
a
natural
expectation
that
the
kiss
which
he
had
laid
on
miss
ravenel
hand
would
draw
him
nearer
to
her
and
render
their
relations
more
sentimentally
sympathetic
he
did
not
base
his
hopes
however
on
the
impression
produced
by
the
mere
physical
contact
of
the
salute
he
had
such
an
exalted
opinion
of
the
young
lady
spiritual
purity
that
he
never
thought
of
believing
that
she
could
be
influenced
by
any
simply
carnal
impulses
however
innocent
and
furthermore
he
was
himself
in
a
too
exalted
and
seraphic
state
of
feeling
to
attach
much
importance
to
the
mere
motion
of
the
blood
and
thrillings
of
the
spinal
marrow
but
he
did
think
in
an
unreasoning
blindly
longing
way
that
the
fact
of
his
having
kissed
her
once
was
good
reason
for
hoping
that
he
might
some
day
kiss
her
again
and
be
permitted
to
love
her
without
exciting
her
anger
and
possibly
even
gain
the
wondrous
boon
of
being
loved
by
her
notwithstanding
his
practical
new
england
education
and
his
individual
sensitiveness
at
the
idea
of
doing
or
so
much
as
meditating
any
thing
ridiculous
he
drifted
into
certain
reveries
of
conceivable
interviews
with
the
young
lady
wherein
she
and
he
gradually
and
sweetly
approxinated
until
matrimony
seemed
to
be
the
only
natural
conclusion
but
the
next
time
he
called
at
the
ravenel
house
he
found
larue
there
and
what
was
worse
colonel
carter
lillie
remembered
the
kiss
to
be
sure
and
blushed
at
the
sight
of
the
giver
but
she
preserved
her
in
all
other
respects
and
was
evidently
not
a
charmed
victim
i
think
i
am
able
to
assure
the
reader
that
in
her
head
the
osculation
had
given
birth
to
no
reveries
it
is
true
that
for
a
moment
it
had
startled
her
greatly
and
seemed
to
awaken
in
her
some
mighty
and
mysterious
influence
but
it
is
also
true
that
she
was
half
angry
at
him
for
troubling
her
spiritual
nature
so
potently
and
that
on
the
whole
he
had
not
advanced
himself
a
single
step
in
her
affections
by
his
audacity
if
any
thing
she
treated
him
with
more
reserve
and
kept
him
at
a
greater
distance
than
before
larue
did
her
best
to
make
up
for
the
indifference
of
lillie
and
to
reward
colburne
not
so
much
for
his
friendly
offices
of
the
evening
previous
as
for
his
other
and
in
her
eyes
much
greater
merits
of
being
young
and
handsome
the
best
that
the
widow
could
offer
however
was
little
to
the
captain
indeed
had
she
laid
her
heart
hand
and
fortune
at
his
feet
he
would
only
have
been
embarrassed
by
the
unacceptable
benificence
and
he
was
even
somewhat
alarmed
at
the
dangerous
glitter
of
her
eyes
and
freedom
of
her
conversation
it
must
be
understood
here
that
madame
devotion
to
him
fervent
as
it
seemed
was
not
she
would
have
preferred
to
harness
the
colonel
into
her
triumphal
chariot
and
had
only
given
up
that
idea
after
a
series
of
ineffectual
efforts
some
men
can
be
driven
by
a
cunning
hand
through
flirtations
which
they
do
not
enjoy
just
as
a
spiritless
horse
can
be
held
down
and
touched
up
to
a
creditable
trot
but
carter
was
not
a
nag
to
be
managed
in
this
way
being
too
experienced
and
selfish
too
willful
by
nature
and
too
much
accustomed
to
domineer
to
allow
himself
to
be
guided
by
a
jockey
whom
he
did
not
fancy
could
she
have
got
at
him
alone
and
often
enough
she
might
perhaps
have
broken
him
in
for
she
knew
of
certain
secret
methods
of
rareyizing
gentlemen
which
hardly
ever
fail
upon
persons
of
carter
physical
and
moral
nature
but
thus
far
she
had
found
neither
the
time
nor
the
juxtaposition
necessary
to
a
trial
of
her
system
accordingly
she
had
been
obliged
to
admit
and
make
the
best
of
the
fact
that
he
was
resolved
to
do
the
most
of
his
talking
with
miss
ravenel
leave
the
two
alone
she
could
not
according
to
new
orleans
ideas
of
propriety
and
so
was
compelled
for
a
time
to
play
what
might
be
called
a
footman
part
in
conversation
standing
behind
and
listening
it
was
a
pleasant
relief
from
this
experience
to
take
the
ribbons
in
her
own
hands
and
drive
the
tractable
though
reluctant
colburne
while
the
colonel
and
lillie
talked
in
the
parlor
the
captain
and
larue
held
long
dialogues
in
the
balcony
he
let
her
have
the
major
part
of
these
conversations
because
she
liked
it
because
he
felt
no
particular
spirit
for
it
and
because
as
a
listener
he
could
glance
oftener
at
miss
ravenel
although
a
younger
man
than
carter
and
a
handsomer
one
he
never
thought
to
outshine
him
or
in
common
parlance
to
cut
him
out
holding
him
in
too
high
respect
as
a
superior
officer
and
looking
up
to
him
also
with
that
deference
which
most
homebred
unvitiated
youth
accord
to
mature
worldlings
the
innocent
country
lad
bows
to
the
courtly
rou√©
because
he
perceives
his
polish
and
does
not
suspect
his
corruption
captain
colburne
and
miss
ravenel
were
similarly
innocent
and
juvenile
in
their
worshipful
appreciation
of
colonel
carter
the
only
difference
was
that
the
former
being
a
man
made
no
secret
of
his
admiration
while
the
latter
being
a
marriageable
young
lady
covered
hers
under
a
mask
of
playful
raillery
are
you
not
ashamed
she
said
to
let
me
catch
you
tyrannizing
over
my
native
city
do
mention
it
hav
the
heart
to
go
on
much
longer
i
resign
the
mayoralty
if
you
will
accept
it
offer
it
to
my
father
and
see
if
i
do
accept
for
him
this
was
a
more
audacious
thrust
than
the
young
lady
was
aware
of
the
idea
of
a
civilian
mayor
was
one
that
high
authority
considered
feasible
provided
a
citizen
could
be
found
who
was
loyal
enough
to
deserve
the
post
and
influential
enough
to
pay
for
it
by
building
up
that
so
union
party
a
good
suggestion
said
the
colonel
i
shall
respectfully
refer
it
to
the
distinguished
consideration
of
the
commanding
general
he
entertained
no
such
intention
the
extras
of
his
mayoralty
being
exceedingly
important
to
him
in
view
of
the
extent
and
costly
nature
of
his
present
domestic
establishment
oh
do
answered
miss
ravenel
why
not
if
you
please
because
that
would
be
bribing
me
to
turn
yankee
outright
this
brief
passage
in
a
long
conversation
suggested
to
carter
that
it
might
be
well
for
himself
to
procure
some
position
or
profitable
employment
for
the
doctor
if
a
man
seems
likely
to
appropriate
your
peaches
one
of
the
best
things
that
you
can
do
is
to
offer
him
somebody
else
apples
moreover
he
actually
felt
a
sincere
and
even
strong
interest
in
the
worldly
welfare
of
the
ravenels
by
a
little
dexterous
questioning
he
found
that
not
only
was
the
college
bare
of
students
but
that
his
railroad
stock
paid
nothing
and
that
in
short
he
had
lost
all
his
property
except
his
house
and
some
small
bank
deposits
ravenel
smilingly
admitted
that
he
had
been
justly
punished
for
investing
in
anything
which
bore
even
a
geographical
relation
to
the
crime
of
slavery
he
received
with
bewildered
though
courteously
calm
astonishment
a
proposition
that
he
should
try
his
hand
at
a
sugar
speculation
i
beg
pardon
i
really
do
understand
said
he
i
am
so
unaccustomed
to
business
transactions
why
you
buy
the
sugar
for
six
cents
a
pound
and
sell
it
for
twenty
bless
me
what
a
profit
why
do
business
men
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
because
they
hav
the
opportunity
because
it
requires
a
permit
from
the
powers
that
be
to
get
the
sugar
oh
confiscated
sugar
i
comprehend
but
i
supposed
that
the
government
you
do
comprehend
at
all
my
dear
doctor
not
confiscated
sugar
but
sugar
that
we
ca
confiscate
sugar
beyond
our
reach
beyond
the
lines
you
must
understand
that
the
rebels
want
quinine
salt
shoes
gold
and
lots
of
things
we
want
sugar
and
cotton
a
barter
is
effected
and
each
party
is
benefited
i
should
call
it
a
stupid
arrangement
and
contrary
to
the
laws
of
war
only
that
it
is
permitted
by
by
very
high
authority
at
all
events
it
is
very
profitable
and
perfectly
safe
you
really
astonish
me
confessed
the
doctor
whose
looks
expressed
even
more
amazement
than
his
language
i
should
have
considered
such
a
trade
nothing
less
than
treasonable
i
do
mean
to
say
that
it
is
but
i
am
willing
to
make
allowances
for
the
parties
who
engage
in
it
considering
whose
auspices
they
act
under
as
i
was
saying
the
trade
is
contrary
to
the
articles
of
war
it
is
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy
but
the
powers
that
be
for
unknown
reasons
which
i
am
of
course
bound
to
respect
grant
permits
to
certain
persons
to
bring
about
these
exchanges
i
do
doubt
that
such
a
permit
could
be
obtained
for
you
will
you
accept
it
would
you
accept
it
for
yourself
asked
the
doctor
i
am
a
united
states
officer
replied
the
colonel
squaring
his
shoulders
and
a
born
virginian
gentleman
he
was
about
to
add
but
checked
himself
by
the
way
it
is
remarkable
how
rarely
this
man
spoke
of
his
native
state
it
is
likely
enough
that
he
had
some
remorse
of
conscience
or
rather
some
qualms
of
sentiment
as
to
the
choice
which
he
had
made
in
fighting
against
instead
of
for
the
old
dominion
if
he
ever
mentioned
her
name
it
was
simply
to
express
his
pleasure
that
he
was
not
warring
within
her
borders
in
other
respects
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
infer
from
his
conversation
that
he
was
a
southerner
or
that
he
was
conscious
of
being
any
thing
but
a
graduate
of
west
point
and
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
but
it
was
only
in
political
matters
that
he
was
false
to
his
in
his
strong
passions
his
capacity
for
domestic
sympathies
his
strange
conscience
as
sensitive
on
some
points
as
callous
on
others
his
spendthrift
habits
his
inclination
to
swearing
and
drinking
his
mixture
in
short
of
gentility
and
barbarism
he
was
a
true
child
of
his
class
and
state
he
was
a
virginian
in
his
vacillation
previous
to
a
decision
and
in
the
vigor
which
he
could
exhibit
after
having
once
decided
a
virginian
gentleman
is
popularly
supposed
to
be
a
combination
of
laziness
and
dignity
but
this
is
an
error
the
type
would
be
considered
a
marvel
of
energy
in
some
countries
and
as
we
have
seen
in
this
war
it
is
capable
of
amazing
activity
audacity
and
perseverance
of
all
the
states
which
have
fought
against
the
union
virginia
has
displayed
the
most
formidable
military
qualities
and
i
am
a
united
states
citizen
said
the
doctor
as
firmly
as
the
colonel
though
without
squaring
his
shoulders
or
making
any
other
physical
assertion
of
lofty
character
very
you
mean
it
i
of
course
you
you
are
quite
right
it
is
the
correct
thing
this
trade
as
a
matter
of
course
still
knowing
that
it
was
allowed
and
not
knowing
how
you
might
feel
about
it
i
thought
i
would
offer
you
the
chance
it
pays
like
piracy
i
have
known
a
single
smuggle
to
net
forty
thousand
dollars
after
paying
hush
money
and
every
thing
shocking
said
the
doctor
but
you
must
think
that
i
am
not
obliged
to
you
i
really
am
grateful
for
your
interest
in
my
only
i
ca
accept
some
men
have
virtue
strong
enough
to
survive
such
things
but
i
fear
that
my
character
is
of
too
low
and
feeble
a
standard
you
are
not
offended
i
hope
observed
the
colonel
after
a
thoughtful
pause
during
which
he
debated
whether
he
should
offer
the
doctor
the
mayoralty
and
decided
in
the
negative
not
at
all
i
beg
you
to
believe
not
at
all
but
how
is
it
possible
that
such
transactions
are
not
checked
he
exclaimed
recurring
to
his
amazement
the
government
ought
to
be
informed
of
them
who
is
to
inform
not
the
barterers
nor
their
abettors
i
suppose
you
do
expect
that
of
these
business
fellows
you
think
perhaps
that
i
ought
to
expose
the
thing
but
in
the
army
we
obey
orders
without
criticising
our
superiors
publicly
suppose
i
should
inform
and
find
myself
unable
to
prove
any
thing
and
be
dismissed
the
service
the
doctor
hung
his
head
in
virtuous
discouragement
admitting
to
himself
that
this
world
is
indeed
an
unsatisfactory
planet
you
may
rely
upon
my
secrecy
concerning
all
this
colonel
he
said
i
do
so
at
least
so
far
as
regards
your
authority
as
for
the
trade
itself
i
do
care
how
soon
it
is
blown
upon
if
the
colonel
had
been
a
quoter
of
poetry
which
he
was
not
he
would
probably
have
repeated
as
he
walked
homeward
an
honest
man
the
noblest
work
of
god
what
he
did
say
to
himself
was
by
jove
i
must
get
the
doctor
a
good
thing
of
some
sort
ten
days
later
he
called
at
the
house
with
a
second
proposition
which
astonished
ravenel
almost
as
much
as
the
first
miss
ravenel
he
said
you
are
a
very
influential
person
every
body
who
knows
you
admits
it
colburne
admits
it
i
admit
it
lillie
blushed
with
unusual
heartiness
and
tried
in
vain
to
think
of
some
saucy
answer
the
colonel
quizzical
smile
his
free
and
easy
compliments
and
confident
address
sometimes
touched
the
pride
of
the
young
lady
and
made
her
desire
to
rebel
against
him
i
want
you
he
continued
to
persuade
doctor
ravenel
to
be
a
colonel
a
colonel
exclaimed
father
and
daughter
yes
and
a
better
colonel
than
half
those
in
the
service
on
which
side
colonel
carter
asked
miss
ravenel
who
saw
a
small
chance
for
vengeance
good
heavens
do
you
suppose
i
am
recruiting
for
rebel
regiments
i
did
know
but
larue
might
have
brought
you
over
the
colonel
laughed
obstreperously
at
the
insinuation
not
in
the
least
dashed
by
its
pertness
no
it
a
loyal
regiment
black
in
the
face
with
loyalty
general
butler
has
decided
on
organizing
a
force
out
of
the
free
colored
population
of
the
city
it
is
possible
oh
what
a
shame
exclaimed
lillie
the
doctor
said
nothing
but
leaned
forward
with
marked
interest
there
is
no
secret
about
it
continued
carter
the
thing
is
decided
on
and
will
be
made
public
immediately
but
it
is
a
disagreeable
affair
to
handle
it
will
make
an
awful
outcry
here
and
every
where
it
would
be
wise
to
identify
the
government
too
closely
with
it
until
it
is
sure
to
be
a
success
consequently
the
darkies
will
be
enrolled
as
militia
state
troops
you
see
just
as
your
rebel
friend
lovell
miss
ravenel
enrolled
them
moreover
to
give
the
arrangement
a
further
local
character
it
is
thought
best
to
have
at
least
one
of
the
regiments
commanded
by
some
well
known
citizen
of
new
orleans
i
proposed
this
idea
to
the
general
and
he
does
think
badly
of
it
now
who
will
sacrifice
himself
for
his
country
who
will
make
the
niggers
in
uniform
respectable
doctor
will
you
do
it
papa
you
shall
do
no
such
thing
cried
lillie
thoroughly
provoked
then
reproachfully
oh
colonel
carter
the
colonel
laughed
with
immovable
good
humor
and
surveyed
her
pretty
wrath
with
calm
admiration
be
quiet
my
child
pronounced
the
doctor
with
an
unusual
tone
of
authority
colonel
i
am
interested
exceedingly
interested
in
what
you
tell
me
the
idea
is
admirable
it
will
be
a
lasting
honor
to
the
man
who
conceived
it
oh
papa
protested
lillie
she
was
slightly
unionized
but
not
in
the
least
abolitionized
i
am
delighted
that
general
butler
has
resolved
to
take
the
responsibility
of
it
continued
the
doctor
our
free
negroes
are
really
a
respectable
class
many
of
them
are
wealthy
and
well
educated
in
the
whole
south
general
butler
could
not
have
found
another
so
favorable
a
place
to
try
this
experiment
as
new
orleans
i
am
glad
you
think
so
answered
the
colonel
but
he
said
it
with
an
air
of
no
great
enthusiasm
in
fact
how
could
an
old
army
officer
a
west
point
military
brahmin
and
a
virginian
gentleman
look
with
favor
at
first
sight
on
the
plan
of
raising
nigger
regiments
but
as
for
the
colonelcy
continued
the
doctor
are
you
positively
serious
in
making
me
that
proposition
positively
why
i
am
no
more
fit
to
be
a
colonel
than
i
am
to
be
a
professor
of
sanscrit
and
chinese
literature
that
need
stand
in
the
way
at
all
that
is
of
no
consequence
ravenel
laughed
outright
and
waited
for
an
explanation
your
and
major
will
be
experienced
officers
that
is
for
volunteers
said
carter
they
will
know
the
drill
at
any
rate
your
part
will
be
simply
to
give
the
thing
a
local
coloring
as
if
the
new
orleans
people
had
got
it
up
among
themselves
here
he
burst
into
a
at
the
idea
of
saddling
louisianians
with
the
imputation
of
desiring
and
raising
nigger
soldiers
for
putting
down
the
rebellion
and
slavery
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
regiment
he
went
on
as
soon
as
it
is
organized
or
under
way
you
will
be
detached
you
will
be
superintendent
of
negro
education
or
superintendent
of
negro
labor
or
something
of
that
sort
you
will
have
the
rank
and
pay
of
colonel
you
see
but
your
work
will
be
civil
instead
of
military
it
will
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
niggers
oh
indeed
answered
the
doctor
his
face
for
the
first
time
showing
that
the
proposition
had
for
him
a
pole
of
attraction
so
officers
can
be
detached
for
such
purposes
it
is
perfectly
honorable
is
it
quite
so
army
custom
about
the
same
thing
as
making
an
officer
a
or
military
governor
or
mayor
really
i
am
vastly
tempted
i
am
vastly
flattered
and
very
grateful
i
must
think
of
it
i
will
consider
it
seriously
in
his
philanthropic
excitement
he
rose
and
walked
the
room
for
some
minutes
the
windows
were
open
and
admitted
what
little
noise
of
population
there
was
in
the
street
so
that
miss
ravenel
and
the
colonel
sitting
near
each
other
could
exchange
a
few
words
without
being
overheard
by
the
abstracted
doctor
i
suspect
that
the
young
lady
was
more
angry
at
this
moment
than
on
any
previous
occasion
recorded
in
the
present
history
colburne
would
have
quailed
before
her
evident
excitement
but
colonel
carter
the
widower
faced
her
with
a
smile
of
amusement
seeing
that
there
was
no
prospect
of
striking
a
panic
into
the
foe
she
made
a
flanking
movement
instead
of
a
direct
attack
what
do
you
suppose
the
old
army
will
think
of
the
negro
regiment
plan
i
suppose
then
how
can
you
advise
my
father
to
go
into
a
thing
which
you
call
she
demanded
her
lips
trembling
with
an
agitation
which
was
partly
anger
and
partly
alarm
at
her
own
audacity
as
this
was
a
question
which
carter
could
not
answer
satisfactorily
without
telling
her
that
he
knew
how
poor
her
father
was
and
also
knew
what
a
bad
thing
poverty
was
he
made
no
reply
but
rose
and
sauntered
about
the
room
with
his
thumbs
in
his
vest
pockets
and
lillie
was
so
curiously
in
awe
of
this
mature
man
who
said
what
he
pleased
and
was
silent
when
he
pleased
that
she
made
no
further
assault
on
him
i
must
confess
said
the
doctor
resuming
his
seat
that
this
is
a
most
attractive
and
flattering
proposition
i
am
vain
enough
to
believe
that
i
could
be
of
use
to
this
poor
ignorant
brutish
insulted
plundered
race
of
pariahs
and
helots
if
i
could
organize
negro
labor
in
louisiana
on
a
basis
just
and
profitable
to
all
parties
i
should
consider
myself
more
honored
than
by
being
made
president
of
the
united
states
in
ordinary
times
if
i
could
be
the
means
of
educating
their
darkened
minds
and
consciences
to
a
decent
degree
of
christian
intelligence
and
virtue
i
would
not
exchange
my
good
name
for
that
of
a
paul
or
an
apollos
my
only
objection
to
this
present
plan
is
the
colonelcy
i
should
be
in
a
false
position
i
should
feel
myself
to
be
ridiculous
not
that
it
is
ridiculous
to
be
a
colonel
he
explained
smiling
but
to
wear
the
uniform
and
receive
the
pay
of
a
colonel
without
being
one
there
is
the
satire
now
could
not
that
point
be
evaded
could
i
not
be
made
superintendent
of
negro
labor
without
being
burdened
with
the
military
dignity
i
really
feel
some
conscientious
scruples
on
the
matter
quite
aside
from
my
desire
not
to
appear
absurd
i
should
be
willing
to
do
the
work
for
less
pay
provided
i
could
escape
the
livery
i
am
sorry
to
give
you
any
trouble
when
i
am
already
under
such
obligations
but
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
inquire
whether
this
superintendency
could
not
be
established
without
attaching
to
it
the
military
position
certainly
but
i
foresee
a
difficulty
will
the
general
dare
to
found
such
an
office
and
set
aside
public
money
for
its
salary
i
suppose
he
has
no
legal
right
to
do
it
detach
an
officer
for
the
purpose
that
is
all
very
simple
and
allowable
it
army
fashion
but
when
it
comes
to
founding
new
civil
offices
you
trench
upon
state
or
federal
authority
besides
this
superintendency
of
negro
labor
is
going
to
be
a
heavy
thing
and
the
general
may
want
to
keep
it
directly
under
his
own
thumb
as
he
can
do
if
the
superintendent
is
an
army
officer
however
i
will
ask
your
question
and
if
the
civil
office
can
be
founded
you
will
accept
it
is
it
not
so
i
do
accept
most
gratefully
most
proudly
but
how
if
the
superintendency
ca
be
had
without
the
colonelcy
why
then
i
i
fear
i
shall
be
forced
to
decline
i
really
do
feel
that
i
can
place
myself
in
a
false
position
only
do
suppose
that
i
am
unconscious
of
my
profound
obligations
to
you
what
an
old
trump
of
a
don
quixote
mused
the
colonel
as
he
lit
his
segar
in
the
street
for
the
walk
homeward
it
devilish
handsome
conduct
in
him
but
by
jove
i
do
believe
the
old
fellow
can
afford
it
i
afraid
it
will
be
work
for
him
to
get
a
decent
living
in
this
wicked
world
however
he
may
succeed
in
the
next
a
few
minutes
later
a
cold
chill
of
worldly
wisdom
struck
through
his
enthusiasm
he
has
starved
long
enough
to
bring
him
to
his
milk
he
thought
when
he
gets
down
to
his
last
dollar
and
a
thousand
or
two
below
it
he
wo
be
so
particular
as
to
how
he
lines
his
pockets
the
colonel
almost
felt
that
a
civilian
had
no
right
to
such
a
delicate
and
costly
sense
of
honor
he
would
have
been
rather
glad
to
have
the
doctor
enter
into
some
of
these
schemes
for
getting
money
inasmuch
as
this
same
filthy
lucre
was
all
that
miss
ravenel
needed
to
make
her
a
very
attractive
the
next
day
he
repaired
at
the
earliest
office
hours
to
and
plead
earnestly
to
have
the
proposed
superintendency
founded
on
the
basis
of
a
civil
office
the
salary
to
be
furnished
by
the
state
or
by
the
city
or
by
a
levied
on
the
wages
of
the
negroes
but
the
proconsul
did
not
like
to
assume
such
a
responsibility
and
moreover
would
not
sympathise
with
the
fastidiousness
on
the
subject
of
the
uniform
the
colonel
hurried
back
to
ravenel
and
urged
him
to
accept
the
military
appointment
he
repeated
to
him
remember
this
is
a
matter
of
hundred
a
year
with
a
pertinacity
which
was
the
same
as
to
say
you
know
that
you
can
not
afford
to
refuse
such
a
salary
the
doctor
did
not
dispute
the
correctness
of
the
insinuation
but
persisted
with
smiling
obstinacy
in
declining
the
eagles
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
he
was
somewhat
unreasonable
on
the
subject
and
that
the
colonel
was
not
far
from
right
in
being
secretly
a
little
angry
with
him
the
latter
did
not
care
a
straw
for
the
niggers
but
he
desired
very
earnestly
to
put
the
ravenels
on
the
road
to
fortune
and
he
foresaw
that
a
superintendent
of
colored
labor
would
infallibly
be
tempted
by
very
considerable
side
earnings
and
perquisites
even
miss
lillie
was
rather
disappointed
at
the
failure
of
the
project
to
arm
negroes
to
command
a
colored
regiment
was
abolitionistic
and
abominable
but
to
set
the
same
negroes
to
work
on
a
hundred
plantations
would
be
playing
the
southerner
the
planter
the
sugar
aristocrat
on
a
magnificent
scale
and
she
thought
also
that
in
this
business
her
father
might
do
ever
so
much
good
and
make
for
himself
a
noble
name
in
louisiana
by
restoring
thousands
of
runaway
to
their
lawful
owners
let
us
not
be
too
severe
upon
the
barbarian
beliefs
of
this
civilized
young
lady
she
had
not
the
same
geographical
reasons
for
loving
human
liberty
in
the
abstract
that
we
have
who
were
nurtured
in
the
truly
free
and
democratic
north
moreover
for
some
reason
which
i
shall
not
trouble
myself
to
discover
all
women
love
aristocracies
the
ravenel
funds
were
getting
low
and
the
doctor
despairing
of
finding
profitable
occupation
in
depopulated
new
orleans
was
thinking
seriously
of
returning
to
new
boston
when
high
authority
sent
him
an
appointment
as
superintendent
of
a
city
hospital
with
a
salary
of
fifteen
hundred
dollars
i
can
do
that
he
said
jubilantly
as
he
showed
the
appointment
to
carter
unaware
that
the
latter
had
been
the
means
of
obtaining
it
my
medical
education
will
come
in
play
there
and
i
shall
feel
that
i
am
acting
in
my
own
character
it
will
not
be
so
grand
a
field
of
usefulness
as
that
which
you
so
kindly
offered
me
but
it
will
perhaps
approximate
more
nearly
to
my
abilities
it
is
a
captain
pay
instead
of
a
colonel
laughed
carter
i
know
any
body
who
would
make
such
a
choice
except
you
and
young
colburne
who
supposes
that
he
is
fit
to
be
a
field
officer
some
day
will
perhaps
be
able
to
do
better
by
you
when
the
western
railroad
is
recovered
the
railroad
in
which
you
hold
property
there
will
be
the
superintendency
of
that
probably
a
matter
of
some
three
or
four
thousand
dollars
a
year
but
i
could
do
it
objected
the
doctor
thereby
drawing
another
laugh
from
his
interlocutor
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
fifteen
hundred
although
it
was
so
miserably
inferior
to
the
annual
six
thousand
which
he
used
to
draw
from
his
scientific
labors
in
and
out
of
the
defunct
college
as
long
as
he
could
live
and
retain
his
he
was
not
much
disposed
to
grumble
at
providence
things
in
general
were
going
well
the
rebellion
would
be
put
down
slavery
would
perish
in
the
struggle
truth
and
justice
would
prevail
the
certainty
of
these
results
formed
in
his
estimation
a
part
of
his
personal
estate
a
wealth
which
was
invisible
it
is
true
but
none
the
less
real
inexhaustible
and
consolatory
a
wealth
which
was
sufficient
to
enrich
and
ennoble
every
american
citizen
when
it
was
known
throughout
the
city
that
he
had
accepted
a
position
from
the
federal
authorities
the
name
of
ravenel
became
entirely
hateful
to
those
who
only
a
few
years
before
accorded
it
their
friendship
and
respect
the
hostile
gulf
between
lillie
and
her
old
friends
yawned
into
such
a
vast
abyss
that
few
words
were
ever
exchanged
across
it
and
even
those
that
did
occasionally
reach
her
anxious
ears
had
a
tone
of
anger
which
excited
sometimes
her
grief
and
sometimes
her
resentment
the
young
lady
character
was
such
that
the
resentment
steadily
gained
on
the
grief
and
she
became
from
day
to
day
less
of
a
secessionist
and
more
of
a
unionist
her
father
laughed
in
his
way
to
see
how
spited
she
was
by
this
social
ostracism
you
should
never
quarrel
with
a
pig
because
he
is
a
pig
said
he
the
only
wise
way
is
not
to
suppose
that
you
can
make
a
of
him
and
not
to
invite
him
into
your
parlor
these
poor
people
have
been
brought
up
to
hate
and
maltreat
every
body
who
does
not
agree
with
their
opinions
if
the
apostle
paul
should
come
here
they
would
knock
him
on
the
head
for
making
a
brother
of
onesimus
but
i
ca
bear
to
be
treated
so
answered
the
vexed
young
lady
i
do
want
to
be
knocked
on
the
head
nor
to
have
you
knocked
on
the
head
i
do
even
want
them
to
think
what
they
do
about
me
i
wish
i
had
the
supreme
power
for
a
day
or
two
what
progress
observed
the
doctor
she
wants
to
be
general
butler
no
i
do
snapped
lillie
whose
nerves
were
indeed
much
worried
by
her
internal
struggles
and
outward
trials
but
i
would
like
to
be
emperor
i
would
actually
enjoy
forcing
some
of
these
horrid
people
to
change
their
style
of
talking
i
do
think
you
would
enjoy
it
my
dear
i
did
once
entertain
the
design
of
making
myself
autocrat
and
deciding
what
should
be
believed
by
my
fellow
citizens
and
bringing
to
deserved
punishment
such
as
differed
from
me
it
would
be
such
a
fine
thing
i
thought
to
manage
in
my
own
way
and
manage
right
all
the
religion
politics
business
education
and
conscience
of
the
country
but
i
dropped
the
plan
after
mature
consideration
because
i
foresaw
that
it
would
give
me
more
to
do
than
i
could
attend
to
lillie
working
at
her
embroidery
made
no
reply
not
apparently
appreciating
her
father
wit
presently
she
gave
token
that
the
current
of
her
thoughts
had
changed
by
breaking
out
with
her
usual
routine
of
questions
who
did
you
see
in
the
streets
did
you
see
any
body
did
you
hear
any
thing
etc
etc
by
what
has
been
related
in
this
chapter
it
will
be
perceived
that
colonel
carter
has
established
a
claim
to
be
received
with
at
least
courtesy
in
the
house
of
the
ravenels
the
doctor
could
not
decently
turn
a
cold
shoulder
to
a
man
who
had
been
so
zealous
a
friend
although
he
still
admired
him
very
little
and
never
willingly
permitted
him
a
moment
unwatched
intercourse
with
lillie
he
occasionally
thought
with
disgust
of
van
zandt
leering
insinuations
concerning
the
little
french
boudoir
but
he
charitably
concluded
that
he
ought
not
to
attach
much
importance
to
the
prattle
of
a
man
so
clearly
under
the
influence
of
liquor
as
was
that
person
at
colburne
quarters
and
finally
he
reflected
with
a
sigh
that
the
boudoir
business
was
awfully
common
in
the
world
as
then
constituted
and
that
men
who
were
engaged
in
it
could
not
well
be
ostracised
from
society
so
outwardly
he
was
civil
to
the
colonel
and
inwardly
sought
to
control
his
almost
instinctive
repugnance
as
for
lillie
she
positively
liked
the
widower
and
thought
him
the
finest
gentleman
of
the
very
few
who
now
called
on
her
captain
colburne
was
very
pleasant
lively
and
good
but
and
here
she
ceased
to
reason
she
felt
that
he
was
not
magnetic
chapter
xiii
the
course
of
true
love
begins
to
run
rough
in
some
arabian
nights
or
other
there
is
a
story
of
voyagers
in
a
becalmed
ship
who
were
drifted
by
irresistible
currents
towards
an
unknown
island
as
they
gazed
at
it
their
eyes
were
deceived
by
an
enchantment
in
the
atmosphere
so
that
they
seemed
to
see
upon
the
shore
a
number
of
beautiful
women
waiting
to
welcome
them
whereas
these
expectant
figures
were
really
nothing
but
hideous
apes
with
carniverous
appetites
whose
desire
it
was
to
devour
the
approaching
strangers
as
miss
ravenel
drifted
towards
colonel
carter
she
beheld
him
in
the
guise
of
a
pure
and
noble
creature
while
in
truth
he
was
a
more
than
commonly
demoralized
man
with
potent
capacities
for
injuring
others
larue
on
the
other
hand
perceived
him
much
as
he
was
and
liked
him
none
the
less
for
it
had
she
lived
in
the
days
before
the
flood
she
would
not
have
cared
specially
for
the
angels
who
came
down
to
enjoy
themselves
with
the
daughters
of
men
except
just
so
far
as
they
satisfied
her
vanity
and
curiosity
seeing
clearly
that
the
colonel
was
not
a
seraph
but
a
creature
of
far
lower
grade
very
coarse
and
carnal
in
some
at
least
of
his
dispositions
she
would
still
have
been
pleased
to
have
him
fall
in
love
with
her
and
would
perhaps
have
accepted
him
as
a
husband
it
is
probable
that
she
did
not
have
a
suspicion
of
the
glamour
which
humbugged
the
innocent
eyes
of
her
youthful
cousin
but
she
did
presently
perceive
that
it
would
be
lillie
and
not
herself
who
would
receive
carter
offer
of
marriage
if
it
was
ever
made
to
either
how
should
she
behave
under
these
trying
circumstances
painful
as
the
discovery
may
have
been
to
her
vanity
it
had
little
effect
on
a
temper
so
callously
amiable
and
none
on
the
lucid
wisdom
of
a
spirit
so
clarified
by
selfishness
she
showed
that
she
was
a
person
of
good
worldly
sense
and
of
little
heart
she
soon
brought
herself
to
encourage
the
carter
flirtation
partly
because
she
had
a
passion
for
seeing
such
things
move
on
and
partly
for
reasons
of
state
if
the
colonel
married
lillie
he
would
be
a
valuable
friend
at
court
moreover
the
match
could
not
hurt
the
social
position
of
her
relatives
who
were
ostracised
as
yankees
already
it
would
be
all
gain
and
no
loss
she
soon
discovered
as
she
thought
that
there
was
no
need
of
blowing
the
colonel
trumpet
in
the
ears
of
miss
lillie
and
that
the
young
lady
could
be
easily
brought
to
greet
him
with
a
betrothal
hymn
of
hail
to
the
chief
who
in
triumph
advances
but
the
doctor
who
evidently
did
not
like
the
colonel
might
exercise
a
deleterious
influence
on
these
fine
chances
madame
larue
must
try
to
lead
the
silly
old
gentleman
to
take
a
reasonable
look
at
his
own
interests
what
a
paroxysm
of
vexation
and
contempt
she
would
have
gone
into
had
she
known
of
his
refusal
to
make
forty
or
fifty
thousand
dollars
on
sugar
merely
because
the
transaction
might
furnish
the
confederate
army
with
salt
and
quinine
not
being
aware
of
this
act
of
cretinism
she
went
at
him
on
the
marriage
business
with
a
hopeful
spirit
what
an
admirable
for
some
of
our
new
orleans
young
ladies
would
be
the
colonel
carter
the
doctor
smiled
and
bowed
his
assent
because
such
was
his
habit
concerning
all
matters
which
were
indifferent
to
him
the
fact
that
he
had
lived
years
in
new
oceans
without
ever
being
driven
to
fight
a
duel
although
disagreeing
with
its
fiery
population
on
various
touchy
subjects
shows
what
an
exquisite
courtesy
he
must
have
maintained
in
his
manners
and
conversation
i
must
positively
introduce
him
to
mees
langdon
or
mees
dumas
and
see
what
will
come
of
it
pursued
madame
ravenel
professed
and
looked
his
delight
at
the
proposition
without
caring
a
straw
for
the
subject
being
engaged
in
a
charming
mineralogical
revery
larue
perceived
his
indifference
and
was
annoyed
by
it
but
continued
to
smile
with
the
fortitude
of
a
veteran
worldling
he
is
of
an
excellent
family
one
of
the
best
families
of
virginia
he
would
be
a
suitable
for
any
young
lady
of
my
acquaintance
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
has
splendid
prospects
he
is
almost
the
only
regular
officer
in
the
department
of
course
he
will
win
promotion
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
him
supersede
picayune
butler
i
beg
your
pardon
i
mean
butler
i
hear
him
so
constantly
called
picayune
that
i
feel
as
if
that
was
his
name
of
baptism
mark
my
prophecy
now
in
a
year
that
man
will
be
superseded
by
colonel
carter
it
might
be
a
change
for
the
better
admitted
the
doctor
with
the
composure
of
a
gallio
the
colonel
has
a
large
salary
continued
madame
the
mayoralty
gives
him
three
thousand
and
his
pay
as
colonel
is
two
thousand
six
hundred
five
thousand
six
hundred
dollars
seems
a
monstrous
salary
in
these
days
of
poverty
it
does
indeed
coincided
the
doctor
remembering
his
own
fifteen
hundred
with
a
momentary
dread
that
it
would
hardly
keep
him
out
of
debt
larue
paused
and
considered
whether
she
should
venture
further
she
had
already
got
as
far
as
this
two
or
three
times
without
eliciting
from
her
a
word
good
or
bad
as
to
the
matter
which
she
had
at
heart
she
had
been
like
a
boy
who
walks
two
miles
to
a
pond
puts
on
his
skates
looks
at
the
thinly
frozen
surface
shakes
his
doubtful
head
unbuckles
his
skates
and
trudges
home
again
she
resolved
to
try
the
ice
this
time
at
no
matter
what
risk
of
breaking
it
i
have
been
thinking
that
he
would
not
be
a
bad
for
my
little
cousin
the
doctor
laid
aside
his
robinsonites
in
some
quiet
corner
of
his
mind
and
devoted
himself
to
the
subject
of
the
conversation
leaning
forward
and
surveying
madame
earnestly
through
his
spectacles
i
would
almost
rather
bury
her
he
said
in
his
excitement
you
amaze
me
there
is
a
difference
in
age
i
grant
but
how
little
he
is
still
what
we
call
a
young
man
and
then
marriages
are
so
difficult
to
make
up
in
these
horrible
times
who
else
is
there
in
all
new
orleans
i
do
see
why
she
should
marry
at
all
said
the
doctor
very
warmly
why
ca
she
continue
to
live
with
me
positively
you
are
not
serious
i
certainly
am
i
beg
pardon
for
disagreeing
with
you
but
i
do
see
why
i
should
entertain
the
idea
i
mention
oh
when
it
comes
to
that
there
is
no
arguing
you
step
out
of
the
bounds
of
reason
into
pure
feeling
and
i
also
beg
your
pardon
but
i
must
tell
you
that
you
are
to
forbid
a
girl
to
marry
is
like
forbidding
a
young
man
to
engage
in
business
to
work
to
open
his
own
a
woman
who
must
not
love
is
defrauded
of
her
best
rights
why
ca
she
be
satisfied
with
loving
me
demanded
the
doctor
he
knew
that
he
was
talking
irrationally
on
this
subject
but
what
he
meant
to
say
was
i
do
like
colonel
carter
because
that
would
leave
her
an
unhappy
sickly
old
maid
retorted
madame
because
that
would
leave
you
without
grandchildren
ravenel
rose
and
walked
the
room
with
a
melancholy
step
and
a
countenance
full
of
trouble
suddenly
he
stopped
short
and
turned
upon
larue
a
look
of
anxious
inquiry
i
hope
you
have
not
observed
in
lillie
any
inclination
towards
this
this
idea
not
the
slightest
replied
madame
lying
frankly
and
without
the
slightest
hesitation
or
confusion
and
you
have
not
broached
it
to
her
never
affirmed
the
lady
solemnly
which
was
another
whopper
i
sincerely
hope
that
you
will
not
oblige
me
i
beg
you
by
promising
that
you
will
not
if
such
is
your
pleasure
sighed
madame
well
i
promise
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
said
the
doctor
i
know
that
there
is
a
difference
in
age
larue
recommenced
thereby
insinuating
that
that
was
the
only
objection
to
the
match
that
she
could
imagine
but
her
solemnly
shook
his
head
as
if
to
say
that
he
had
other
reasons
for
opposition
compared
with
which
this
was
a
trifle
and
so
after
taking
a
sharp
look
at
him
she
judged
it
wise
to
drop
the
subject
i
hope
concluded
the
doctor
that
hereafter
when
i
am
away
you
will
allow
lillie
to
receive
calls
in
your
house
there
is
a
back
passage
it
is
neither
quite
decorous
to
receive
gentlemen
alone
here
nor
to
send
them
away
larue
made
no
objection
to
this
plan
seeing
that
she
could
be
just
as
strict
or
just
as
careless
a
duenna
as
she
chose
i
wonder
why
he
has
such
an
aversion
to
the
match
she
thought
accustomed
to
see
men
matured
in
vice
lead
innocent
young
girls
to
the
altar
habituated
to
look
upon
the
notoriously
doctor
as
a
social
curiosity
rather
than
a
social
standard
she
scarcely
guessed
and
could
not
realize
the
repugnance
with
which
such
a
father
would
resign
a
daughter
to
the
doubtful
protection
of
a
husband
chosen
from
the
class
known
as
men
about
town
aurait
il
d√©couvert
she
continued
to
meditate
ce
petit
liaison
de
monsieur
le
colonel
il
est
vraiment
curieux
mon
plut√¥t
une
vierge
homme
i
beg
the
reader
not
to
do
this
clever
lady
the
injustice
to
suppose
that
she
kept
or
ever
intended
to
keep
her
promise
to
the
doctor
to
him
indeed
she
did
not
for
a
long
time
speak
of
the
proposed
marriage
intending
thereby
to
lull
his
suspicions
to
sleep
and
thus
prevent
him
from
offering
any
timely
opposition
to
that
natural
course
of
human
events
which
might
alone
suffice
to
bring
about
the
desired
end
but
into
lillie
ears
she
perpetually
whispered
pleasant
things
concerning
carter
besides
leaving
the
two
alone
together
for
ten
fifteen
twenty
minutes
at
a
time
until
lillie
would
get
alarmed
at
her
unusual
position
and
become
either
nervously
silent
or
nervously
talkative
for
these
services
the
colonel
was
not
as
grateful
as
he
should
have
been
he
was
just
the
man
to
believe
that
he
could
make
his
own
way
in
a
love
affair
and
need
not
burden
himself
with
a
sense
of
obligation
for
any
one
assistance
moreover
valuing
himself
on
his
knowledge
of
life
he
thought
that
he
understood
larue
character
perfectly
and
declared
that
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
managed
by
such
an
intriguante
however
knowing
he
did
in
fact
perceive
that
she
was
corrupt
and
by
the
way
he
liked
her
none
the
worse
for
it
although
he
would
not
have
married
her
to
colburne
he
spoke
of
her
gaily
and
conceitedly
as
the
larue
or
sometimes
as
la
rou√©e
for
he
knew
french
well
enough
to
make
an
occasional
bad
pun
in
it
the
captain
on
the
other
hand
never
mentioned
her
except
respectfully
feeling
himself
bound
to
treat
any
relative
of
miss
ravenel
with
perfect
courtesy
but
while
carter
supposed
that
he
comprehended
the
larue
he
walked
in
the
path
which
she
had
traced
out
for
him
from
week
to
week
he
found
it
more
agreeable
to
be
with
miss
ravenel
those
random
which
to
her
were
so
alarming
were
to
him
so
pleasant
that
he
caught
himself
anticipating
them
with
anxiety
the
colonel
might
have
known
from
his
past
experience
he
might
have
known
by
only
looking
at
his
face
and
powerful
frame
in
a
mirror
that
it
was
not
a
safe
amusement
for
him
to
be
so
much
with
one
charming
lady
in
his
demeanor
and
like
most
rou√©s
tolerably
cool
for
a
little
distance
below
the
surface
of
his
feelings
he
was
at
bottom
and
by
the
decree
of
imperious
nature
very
volcanic
as
we
say
of
some
fiery
wines
there
was
a
great
deal
of
body
to
him
at
this
time
he
was
determined
not
to
fall
in
love
he
remembered
how
he
had
been
infatuated
in
other
days
and
dreaded
the
return
of
the
passionate
dominion
to
use
his
own
expression
he
made
such
a
blasted
fool
of
himself
when
he
once
got
after
a
woman
nevertheless
he
began
to
be
not
jealous
he
could
not
admit
that
very
soft
impeachment
but
he
began
to
want
to
monopolize
miss
ravenel
when
he
found
colburne
in
her
company
he
sometimes
talked
french
to
her
thereby
embarrassing
and
humiliating
the
captain
who
understood
nothing
of
the
language
except
when
he
saw
it
in
print
and
could
trace
out
the
meaning
of
some
words
by
their
resemblance
to
latin
the
young
lady
either
because
she
felt
for
colburne
awkward
position
or
because
she
did
not
wish
to
be
suspected
of
saying
things
which
she
might
not
have
dared
utter
in
english
usually
restored
the
conversation
to
her
mother
tongue
after
a
few
sentences
once
her
manner
in
doing
this
was
so
pointed
that
the
colonel
apologized
i
beg
pardon
captain
he
said
to
which
he
added
a
white
lie
i
really
supposed
that
you
spoke
french
no
colburne
did
not
speak
french
nor
any
other
modern
language
he
did
not
draw
nor
sing
nor
play
and
was
in
short
as
destitute
of
accomplishments
as
are
most
americans
he
blushed
at
the
apology
which
mortified
him
more
than
the
offence
for
which
it
was
intended
to
atone
he
would
have
given
all
his
greek
for
a
smattering
of
gallic
and
he
took
a
french
teacher
the
next
morning
another
annoyance
to
colburne
was
larue
he
was
still
so
young
in
heart
matters
or
rather
in
coquetry
that
he
was
troubled
by
being
made
the
object
of
airs
of
affection
which
he
could
not
reciprocate
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
lady
was
in
love
with
him
she
never
had
been
in
love
in
her
life
and
was
not
going
to
begin
at
the
plain
placid
truth
was
that
she
was
willing
to
flirt
with
him
to
please
herself
and
determined
to
keep
him
away
from
lillie
in
order
to
give
every
possible
chance
to
carter
only
when
larue
said
flirt
she
meant
indescribable
things
such
as
ladies
may
talk
of
without
reproach
among
themselves
but
which
if
introduced
into
print
are
considered
very
improper
reading
meantime
neither
carter
nor
colburne
understood
her
although
the
former
would
have
hooted
at
the
idea
that
he
did
not
comprehend
the
lady
perfectly
by
jove
soliloquized
the
knowing
colonel
she
is
sweeter
on
him
than
a
pailful
of
syrup
she
puts
one
in
mind
of
a
she
is
licking
him
all
over
preparatory
to
swallowing
him
not
a
bad
sort
of
serpent
to
have
around
one
either
pursued
the
colonel
almost
winking
to
himself
so
knowing
did
he
feel
not
a
bad
sort
of
serpent
only
i
should
care
about
marrying
her
indeed
the
colonel
reminds
one
a
little
of
devilish
sly
old
joey
bagstock
the
innocent
colburne
acknowledged
to
himself
that
he
did
not
comprehend
larue
nor
her
purposes
he
would
have
inferred
from
her
ways
that
she
wanted
him
for
a
husband
only
that
she
spoke
in
a
very
cool
way
of
the
matrimonial
state
marriage
will
not
content
me
nor
will
single
life
she
said
to
him
one
day
i
have
tried
both
and
i
can
not
recommend
either
it
is
a
choice
between
two
evils
and
one
does
not
know
to
say
which
is
the
least
widows
in
search
of
second
husbands
do
not
talk
publicly
in
this
style
and
colburne
intelligently
concluded
that
he
was
not
to
be
invited
to
the
altar
at
the
same
time
larue
went
on
in
this
way
she
treated
him
to
certain
appetizing
little
movements
glances
and
words
which
led
him
to
suspect
with
some
vague
alarm
that
she
did
not
mean
to
let
him
off
as
a
mere
acquaintance
finally
as
is
supposed
an
explanation
ensued
which
was
not
to
his
liking
there
was
an
interview
of
half
an
hour
in
a
back
parlor
brought
about
by
the
graceful
manoeuvres
of
the
lady
of
which
colburne
steadily
refused
to
reveal
the
secrets
although
straitly
questioned
by
the
colonel
by
jove
he
been
bluffing
her
soliloquized
carter
who
thought
he
perceived
that
from
this
private
confabulation
the
parties
came
forth
on
terms
of
estrangement
what
a
queer
fellow
he
is
suppose
he
want
to
marry
her
he
might
amuse
himself
it
would
be
pleasant
to
him
and
would
hurt
her
hanged
if
he
is
a
curiosity
the
next
time
that
colburne
called
on
miss
ravenel
the
larue
took
her
revenge
for
that
mysterious
defeat
the
particulars
of
which
i
am
unable
to
relate
to
comprehend
the
nature
and
efficiency
of
this
vengeance
it
is
necessary
to
take
a
dive
into
the
recesses
of
new
orleans
society
there
is
a
geographical
fable
of
civilized
white
negroes
in
the
centre
of
africa
somewhere
near
the
mountains
of
the
moon
this
fable
is
realized
in
the
crescent
city
and
in
some
of
the
richest
planting
districts
of
louisiana
where
you
will
find
a
class
of
colored
people
who
are
not
black
people
at
all
having
only
the
merest
fraction
of
negro
blood
in
their
veins
and
who
are
respectable
in
character
numbers
of
them
wealthy
and
some
of
them
accomplished
these
creoles
as
they
call
themselves
have
been
free
for
generations
and
until
law
invaded
louisiana
enjoyed
the
same
rights
as
other
citizens
they
are
good
catholics
they
marry
and
are
given
in
marriage
their
sons
are
educated
in
paris
on
a
perfect
level
with
young
frenchmen
their
daughters
receive
the
strict
surveillance
which
is
allotted
to
girls
in
most
southern
countries
in
the
street
many
of
them
are
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
unmixed
descendants
of
the
old
french
planters
but
there
is
a
social
line
of
demarkation
drawn
about
them
like
the
sanitary
cordon
about
an
infected
district
the
race
the
proudest
race
of
modern
times
does
not
marry
nor
consort
with
them
nor
of
late
years
does
the
pure
french
creole
driven
to
join
in
this
ostracism
by
the
brute
force
of
henghist
and
horsa
prejudice
the
new
orleanois
who
before
the
war
should
have
treated
these
white
colored
people
on
terms
of
equality
would
have
shared
in
their
opprobrium
and
perhaps
have
been
ridden
on
a
rail
by
his
outraged
of
northern
descent
now
these
white
negroes
from
the
mountains
of
the
moon
constituted
the
sole
loyal
class
except
the
slaves
which
butler
found
in
louisiana
they
and
their
black
cousins
of
the
sixteenth
degree
were
the
only
people
who
as
a
body
came
forward
with
joy
to
welcome
the
drums
and
tramplings
of
the
new
england
division
and
when
the
commanding
general
called
for
regiments
of
free
blacks
to
uphold
the
stars
and
stripes
he
met
a
patriotic
response
as
enthusiastic
as
that
of
connecticut
or
massachusetts
foremost
in
this
military
uprising
were
two
brothers
of
the
name
of
meurice
who
poured
out
their
wealth
freely
to
meet
those

elegant

would
not

been

by
a

or

where
he
might

listened

met

he
smoked

gave
him
new

concerning

of

for

he
was
now
to
suffer
at
the
caucasian
hands
of
madame

i
am
afraid
that
we
are
doomed
to
lose
you

she
said
with
a
smile
which
expressed
something
worse
than
raillery
i
hear
that
you
have
made
some
fascinating
acquaintances
in

i
never
myself
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
the
meurices
they
are
very
charming
are
they
not
colburne
nerves
quivered
under
this
speech
not
because
he
was
conscious
of
having
done
any
thing
unbecoming
a
gentleman
but
because
he
divined
the
clever
malice
of
the
attack
to
gentle
spirits
the
consciousness
that
they
are
the
objects
of
spite
is
a
dolorous
sensation
it
is
a
very
pleasant
and
intelligent
family
he
replied
bravely
who
are
they
smilingly
asked
miss
ravenel
who
inferred
from
her
aunt
manner
that
colburne
was
to
be

with
amazement
with
horror
with
downright
anger
to
this
new

born
girl
full
of
the
pride
of
lineage
and
the
prejudices
of
the
slaveholding
society
in
which
she
had
been
nurtured
it
seemed
a
downright
insult
that
a
gentleman
who
called
on
her
should
also
call
on
a
and
admit
it
and
defend
it
she
glanced
at
colburne
to
see
if
he
had
a
word
to
offer
of
apology
or
explanation
it
might
be
that
he
had
visited
these
mixed
bloods
in
the
performance
of
some
disagreeable
but
unavoidable
duty
as
an
officer
of
the
federal
army
she
hoped
so
for
she
liked
him
too
well
to
be
willing
to
despise
him
intelligent
but
without
doubt
assented
madame
if
they
had
been
stupid
you
would
not
have
dined
with
them
four
or
five
times
three
times
to
be
exact
larue
said
colburne
he
had
formed
his
line
of
battle
and
could
be
not
merely
defiant
but
ironically
aggressive
but
the
lady
was
master
of
the
southern
tactics
she
had
taken
the
initiative
and
she
attacked
audaciously
although
i
must
explain
without
the
slightest
sign
of
irritation
which
do
you
find
the
most
agreeable
she
asked
the
white
people
of
new
orleans
or
the
brown
colburne
was
tempted
to
reply
that
he
did
not
see
much
difference
but
refrained
on
account
of
miss
ravenel
and
dropping
satire
he
entered
on
a
calm
defence
less
of
himself
than
of
the
mixed
race
in
question
he
affirmed
their
intelligence
education
good
breeding
respectability
of
character
and
exceptional
patriotism
in
a
community
of
rebels
you
larue
think
something
of
the
elegancies
of
society
as
an
element
of
civilization
he
said
now
then
i
am
obliged
to
confess
that
these
people
can
give
a
finer
dinner
better
selected
better
cooked
better
served
than
i
ever
saw
in
my
own
city
of
new
boston
notwithstanding
that
we
are
as
white
as
they
are
and
ca
speak
french
these
meurices
for
example
have
actually
given
me
new
ideas
of
hospitality
as
something
which
may
be
plenteous
without
being
coarse
and
cordial
without
being
laboreous
i
do
hesitate
to
call
them
nice
people
as
for
the
african
blood
in
their
veins
if
that
is
a
reproach
i
ca
detect
a
trace
of
it
i
should
have
believed
it
if
they
had
assured
me
of
it
there
is
a
little
child
there
a
cousin
with
blue
eyes
and
straight
flaxen
hair
she
has
the
honor
if
it
is
one
of
being
whiter
than
i
am
it
will
be
remembered
here
that
any
one
who
was
whiter
than
colburne
was
necessarily
much
whiter
than
larue
when
i
first
saw
the
eldest
meurice
he
proceeded
i
supposed
from
his
looks
that
he
was
a
german
the
major
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
first
napoleon
and
is
certainly
one
of
the
handsomest
men
that
i
have
seen
in
new
orleans
his
manners
are
charming
as
i
suppose
they
ought
to
be
seeing
that
he
has
lived
in
paris
since
he
was
a
child
larue
had
never
transgressed
the
borders
of
louisiana
when
this
war
broke
out
he
came
home
to
see
if
he
might
be
permitted
to
fight
for
his
race
and
for
his
and
my
country
he
now
wears
the
same
uniform
that
i
do
and
he
is
my
superior
officer
it
is
shameful
broke
out
lillie
it
is
the
will
of
authority
answered
colburne
of
authority
that
i
have
sworn
to
respect
a
southern
gentleman
would
resign
said
larue
a
northern
gentleman
keeps
his
oath
and
stands
by
his
flag
retorted
colburne
larue
paused
suppressed
her
rising
excitement
and
with
an
exterior
air
of
meekness
considered
the
situation
she
had
gained
her
battle
she
had
wounded
and
punished
him
she
had
probably
detached
lillie
from
him
now
she
would
stop
the
conflict
i
beg
pardon
she
said
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
with
a
charming
little
expression
of
penitence
i
am
sorry
if
i
have
annoyed
you
i
thought
i
hoped
you
might
perhaps
be
obliged
to
me
for
hinting
to
you
that
these
people
are
not
received
here
in
society
you
are
a
stranger
and
do
not
know
our
prejudices
i
pray
you
to
excuse
me
if
i
have
been
officious
colburne
was
astonished
disarmed
ashamed
notwithstanding
that
he
had
been
in
the
right
and
was
the
injured
party
larue
i
beg
your
pardon
he
answered
i
have
been
unnecessarily
excited
i
sincerely
ask
you
pardon
she
accorded
it
in
pleasant
words
and
with
the
most
amiable
of
smiles
she
was
a
graceful
little
grimalkin
she
could
be
pretty
and
festive
over
a
mouse
while
torturing
it
so
purring
and
indeed
that
the
mouse
himself
could
not
believe
her
to
be
in
earnest
and
prayed
to
be
excused
for
turning
upon
her
it
is
probable
that
not
being
susceptible
to
keen
emotions
she
did
not
know
what
deep
pain
she
had
given
the
young
man
by
her
attack
the
advantage
which
blas√©
people
have
over
innocents
in
a
fight
is
awful
they
know
how
to
hit
and
they
do
mind
the
punishing
it
is
said
that
deaf
burke
physiognomy
was
so
calloused
by
frequent
poundings
that
he
would
permit
any
man
to
give
him
a
facer
for
a
shilling
a
crack
lillie
said
almost
nothing
during
the
conversation
being
quite
overcome
with
amazement
and
anger
at
colburne
degradation
and
at
the
wrongheadedness
the
indelicacy
the
fanaticism
with
which
he
defended
it
when
the
erring
young
man
left
the
house
she
did
not
give
him
her
hand
after
her
usual
friendly
southern
fashion
the
pride
of
race
the
prejudices
of
her
education
would
not
permit
her
to
be
cordial
at
least
not
in
the
first
moments
of
offence
with
one
who
felt
himself
at
liberty
to
go
from
her
parlor
to
that
of
an
octoroon
how
could
a
miss
ravenel
put
herself
on
a
level
with
a

social
heretic
had
taken
himself
away

you

in

anger
mais

persisted
madame
miss
ravenel
rose
and
went
to
her
own
house
and
room
without
answering
since
her
father
fled
from
new
orleans
openly
espousing
the
cause
of
the
north
against
the
south
she
had
not
been
so
vexed
so
hurt
as
she
was
by
this
vulgar
conduct
of
her
friend
captain
colburne
although
it
can
not
be
said
that
she
had
even
begun
to
love
him
she
certainly
did
like
him
better
than
any
other
man
that
she
ever
knew
excepting
her
father
and
colonel
carter
she
had
thought
also
that
he
liked
her
too
well
to
do
anything
which
would
be
sure
to
meet
her
disapprobation
and
her
womanly
pride
was
exceedingly
hurt
in
that
her
friendship
had
been
risked
for
the
sake
of
communion
with
a
race
of
pariahs
there
is
little
doubt
that
colburne
now
had
small
chance
with
miss
ravenel
he
guessed
as
much
and
the
thought
cut
him
even
more
deeply
that
he
could
have
imagined
but
he
was
too
chivalrous
to
be
false
to
his
education
to
his
principles
to
himself
though
it
were
to
gain
the
heart
of
the
only
woman
whom
he
had
ever
loved
in
fact
so
fastidious
was
his
sense
of
honor
that
he
had
disdained
to
fortify
himself
against
attack
by
stating
as
he
might
have
done
truthfully
that
at
one
of
these
meurice
dinners
he
had
sat
by
the
side
of
colonel
carter
i
consider
it
worth
while
to
mention
here
that
colburne
committed
a
great
mistake
about
this
time
in
declining
a
regiment
which
the
eldest
meurice
offered
to
raise
for
him
providing
he
would
apply
for
the
colonelcy
but
it
was
not
for
fear
of
larue
nor
yet
of
miss
ravenel
that
he
declined
the
proffer
he
took
the
proposition
into
serious
consideration
and
referred
it
to
carter
who
advised
him
against
it
public
opinion
on
this
subject
had
not
yet
become
so
overpoweringly
luminous
that
the
old
regular
the
west
point
brahmin
could
see
the
negro
in
a
military
light
i
may
be
all
wrong
he
admitted
with
a
considerable
effusion
of
swearing
if
the
war
spins
out
it
may
prove
me
all
wrong
a
downright
slaughtering
match
of
three
or
four
years
will
force
one
party
or
other
to
call
in
the
nigger
but
i
ca
come
to
it
yet
i
despise
the
low
brute
i
hate
to
see
him
in
uniform
and
then
he
never
will
be
used
for
the
higher
military
operations
if
you
take
a
command
of
niggers
you
will
find
yourself
put
into
fort
pike
or
some
such
place
among
the
mosquitoes
and
fever
and
ague
where
white
men
ca
live
or
your
regiment
will
be
made
and
scavengers
and
baggage
guards
to
do
the
dirty
work
of
white
regiments
you
never
will
form
a
line
of
battle
nor
head
a
storming
column
nor
get
any
credit
if
you
do
and
finally
just
look
at
the
military
position
of
these
louisiana
black
regiments
they
are
not
acknowledged
by
the
government
yet
they
are
not
a
part
of
the

they
are

militia
called
out
by

his
own
responsibility
suppose
the

department
should
approve
his
policy
then
down
goes
your
house
you
have
resigned
your
captaincy
to
get
a
sham
colonelcy
and
there
you
are
out
of
the
service
with
a
uniform
stay
in
the
regiment
you
shall
have

this
and
that
the
first

it
was

more
than
anything
else
induced

longed

of
the

he
had
himself

drilled

up

than

had
alluded
to
under
the
humorous
misnomer
of
a
little
french
whether
this
step
was
taken
by
the
advice
of
larue
or
solely
because
the
colonel
had
found
some
source
of
truer
enjoyment
i
am
unable
to
say
but
it
is
certain
and
it
is
also
a
very
natural
human
circumstance
that
from
this
day
his
admiration
for
miss
ravenel
burgeoned
rapidly
into
the
condition
of

passion

in

in

so
comparatively
peaceful
in
the
malarious
heats
of
louisiana
the
colonel
of
the
tenth
barataria
held
a
swearing
soliloquy
in
general
when
he
swore
it
was
at
somebody
or
to
somebody
but
on
the
present
occasion
the
performance
was
confined
to
the
solitude
of
his
own
room
and
the
gratification
of
his
own
ears
unless
indeed
we
may
venture
to
suppose
that
he
had
a
guardian
angel
whose
painful
duty
it
was
to
attend
him
constantly
i
suspect
that
i
have
not
yet
enabled
the
reader
to
realize
how
remarkable
were
the
colonel
gifts
in
the
way
of
profanity
and
i
fear
that
i
could
not
do
it
without
penning
three
or
four
such
astonishing
pages
as
never
were
printed
unless
it
might
be
in
the
infernal
regions
in
the
appropriate
words
of
lieutenant
van

who
by
the
way
honestly
admired
his
superior
officer
for
this
and
for
his
every
other
characteristic

were

his

it
was

over
he
was
in

lounging
in

chair
his
feet
on
a
table
a
segar
in

hand
and
an
open
letter
in
the
other

the
colonel
or
lieutenant
van

or
men
equally
gifted
in
ardent
expressions
could
suitably
describe
the
heat
of
the
weather
although
he
wore
nothing
but
his
shirt
and
pantaloons
his
cheeks
were
deeply
flushed
and
his
forehead
beaded
with
perspiration
the

mosquitoes
a
numerous
and
venomous
people
were
buzzing
in
his
ears
raising
blotches
on
his
face
and
perforating
his
linen
but
it
was
not
about
them
it
was
about
the
letter
that
he
was
blaspheming
when
the
paroxysm
was
over
he
restored
the
segar
to
his
lips
discovered
that
it
was
out
and
relighted
it
for
he
was
old
smoker
enough
and
healthy
enough
to
prefer
the
pungency
of
a
stump
to
the
milder
flavor
of

without

they
say
they
put
mcclellan
defeat
down
to
his
sentiments
and
pope
defeat
to
mcclellan
they
intend
to
turn
out
every
moderate
man
and
shove
in
their
own
sort
they
talk
of
making
banks
head
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
in
place
of
mcclellan
who
has
just
saved
the
capital
and
the
nation
there
never
was
such
fanaticism
since
the
scotch
ministers
at
dunbar
undertook
to
pray
and
preach
down
cromwell
army
you
are
one
of
the
men
whom
they
have
blackballed
they
have
got
hold
of
the
of
some
old
plans
of
yours
in
the
filibustering
days
and
are
making
the
most
of
it
to
show
that
you
are
unfit
to
command
a
brigade
in
army
of
the
lord
they
say
you
are
not
the
man
to
march
on
with
old
john
brown
soul
and
hang
jeff
davis
on
a
sour
i
think
you
had
better
take
measures
to
get
rid
of
that
filibustering
ghost
i
have
another
piece
of
advice
to
offer
mere
administrative
ability
in
an
office
these
fellows
ca
appreciate
but
they
can
be
dazzled
by
successful
service
in
the
field
because
that
is
beyond
their
own
cowardly
possibilities
also
because
it
takes
with
their
constituents
of
whom
they
are
the
most
respectful
and
obedient
servants
so
why
not
give
up
your
mayoralty
and
go
in
for
the
autumn
campaign
if
you
will
send
home
your
name
with
a
victory
attached
to
it
i
think
we
can
manufacture
a
public
opinion
to
compel
your
nomination
and
confirmation
mind
i
am
not
finding
fault
i
know
that
nothing
can
be
done
in
louisiana
during
the
summer
but
blockheads
do
know
this
and
in
politics
we
are
forced
to
appeal
to
blockheads
our
supreme
court
of
decisions
is
after
all
the
twenty
millions
of
ignorami
who
do
the
voting
accordingly
i
advise
you
to
please
these
twenty
millions
by
putting
yourself
into
the
fall
campaign
very
truly
yours
d
n
it
of
course
i
mean
to
fight
muttered
the
colonel
when
he
had
finished
his
second
reading
i
resign
the
mayoralty
and
ask
for
active
service
and
a
brigade
then
i
must
write
something
to
explain
that
filibustering
no
i
wo
the
less
that
is
explained
the
better
i
deny
it
now
there
weitzel
he
by
this
and
that
can
have
a
star
and
i
ca
my
junior
by
that
and
the
other
in
the
service
by
this
and
that
by
at
least
six
years
what
if
he
should
get
the
active
brigade
it
would
be
just
him
by
this
and
that
to
want
it
and
just
like
butler
by
that
and
the
other
to
give
it
to
him
the
colonel
sat
for
a
long
time
in
vexatious
thought
slapping
his
mosquito
bites
relighting
his
stump
and
smoking
it
down
to
its
bitterest
dregs
finally
without
having
written
a
word
he
gave
up
the
battle
with
the
stinging
multitudes
drank
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
turned
off
the
gas
stepped
into
the
adjoining
bedroom
kicked
off
his
trousers
long
since
unbuttoned
drew
the
and
went
to
bed
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
an
infant
soldiering
habits
had
enabled
him
to
court
slumber
with
success
under
all
circumstances
during
the
month
of
september
was
formed
that
famous
organization
composed
of
five
regiments
of
infantry
with
four
squadrons
and
two
batteries
attached
known
officially
as
the
reserve
brigade
but
popularly
as
weitzel
it
was
intended
from
the
first
for
active
service
and
the
title
reserve
was
applied
to
it
simply
to
mislead
the
enemy
the
regiments
were
encamped
for
purposes
of
drill
and
preparation
on
the
flats
near
carrollton
a
village
four
or
five
miles
above
new
orleans
carter
applied
for
the
brigade
but
was
unable
to
obtain
it
weitzel
was
not
only
his
superior
in
rank
but
was
butler
favorite
officer
and
most
trusted
military
adviser
then
carter
threw
up
his
mayoralty
and
reported
for
duty
to
his
regiment
in
great
bitterness
of
spirit
at
finding
himself
obliged
to
serve
under
a
man
who
had
once
been
his
junior
and
inferior
his
only
consolation
was
that
this
was
not
the
worst
both
he
and
weitzel
were
under
the
orders
of
an
attorney
but
he
went
to
work
vigorously
at
drilling
disciplining
and
fitting
out
his
regiment
his
sunday
morning
inspections
were
awful
ordeals
which
lasted
the
whole
forenoon
if
a
company
showed
three
or
four
dirty
men
the
colonel
sent
for
the
captain
and
gave
him
such
a
lecture
as
made
him
think
seriously
of
tendering
his
resignation
when
not
on
drill
or
guard
duty
the
soldiers
were
busy
nearly
all
day
in
brushing
their
uniforms
polishing
their
brasses
and
buttons
blacking
their
shoes
and
accoutrements
and
washing
their
shirts
drawers
stockings
and
even
their
canteen
strings
the
battalion
drills
of
the
tenth
were
truly
laborious
gymnastic
exercises
performed
in
great
part
on
the
the
sentinels
did
their
whole
duty
or
were
relieved
and
sent
to
the
guardhouse
corporals
who
failed
to
make
their
rounds
properly
were
reduced
to
the
ranks
privates
who
forgot
to
salute
an
officer
or
who
did
not
do
it
in
handsome
style
were
put
in
confinement
on
bread
and
water
the
company
cooking
utensils
were
scoured
every
day
and
the
camp
was
as
clean
as
bare
turfless
earth
could
be
carter
was
a
intelligent
conscientious
beneficent
tyrant
the
tenth
barataria
was
the
show
regiment
of
the
reserve
brigade
i
have
not
time
to
analyze
the
interesting
feelings
of
freeborn
yankees
under
this
searching
despotism
i
can
only
say
that
the
soldiers
hated
their
colonel
because
they
feared
him
that
like
true
americans
they
profoundly
respected
him
because
as
they
said
he
knew
his
biz
that
they
were
excessively
proud
of
the
superior
drill
and
neatness
to
which
he
had
brought
them
against
their
wills
and
that
on
the
whole
they
would
not
have
exchanged
him
for
any
other
regimental
commander
in
the
brigade
they
firmly
believed
that
under
old
carter
they
could
whip
the
best
regiment
in
the
rebel
service
it
is
true
that
there
were
exceptional
ruffians
who
could
not
forget
that
they
had
been
bucked
and
put
in
the
stocks
and
who
muttered
vindictive
prophecies
as
to
something
desperate
which
they
would
do
on
the
first
field
of
battle
bedad
an
i
not
forget
to
pay
me
reshpecs
to
growled
a
hibernian
pugilist
let
get
in
front
of
the
line
an
i
show
that
i
know
how
to
fire
to
the
right
and
left
oblike
carter
laughed
contemptuously
when
informed
of
the
bruiser
threat
it
not
worth
taking
notice
of
he
said
i
know
what
he
do
when
he
comes
under
the
enemy
fire
he
blaze
away
straight
before
him
as
fast
as
he
can
load
and
pull
trigger
he
be
in
such
a
cursed
hurry
to
kill
the
men
who
are
trying
to
kill
him
i
could
probably
make
him
fire
right
oblique
if
i
wanted
to
you
never
have
seen
men
in
battle
captain
colburne
it
really
amusing
to
notice
how
eager
and
savage
new
troops
are
the
moment
a
man
has
discharged
his
piece
he
falls
to
loading
as
if
his
salvation
depended
on
it
the
moment
he
has
loaded
he
fires
just
where
he
did
the
first
time
whether
he
sees
anything
or
not
and
he
keep
doing
this
till
you
stop
him
i
am
speaking
of
raw
troops
you
understand
the
old
cocks
save
their
powder
that
is
unless
they
get
bedeviled
with
a
panic
you
must
remember
this
when
we
come
to
fight
do
let
your
men
get
to
blazing
away
at
nothing
and
scaring
themselves
with
their
own
noise
under
the
delusion
that
they
are
fiercely
engaged
during
the
month
or
more
which
the
brigade
passed
at
carrollton
ravenel
frequently
visited
colburne
and
did
not
forget
to
make
an
incidental
call
or
two
of
civility
on
colonel
carter
on
two
or
three
gala
occasions
he
brought
out
larue
and
miss
ravenel
they
always
came
and
went
by
the
railroad
their
present
means
not
justifying
a
carriage
when
the
ladies
appeared
in
camp
the
colonel
usually
discovered
the
fact
and
hastened
to
make
himself
master
of
the
situation
he
invited
them
under
the
marquee
of
his
double
tent
brought
out
store
of
confiscated
madeira
ordered
the
regimental
band
to
play
sent
word
to
the
to
take
charge
of
and
escorted
his
visitors
in
front
of
the
line
to
show
them
the
exercises
in
these
high
official
hospitalities
neither
colburne
nor
any
other
company
officer
was
invited
to
share
even
the
the
major
the
first
surgeon
and
the
chaplain
though
ranking
as
field
and
staff
officers
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
favored
visitors
and
their
awful
host
for
discipline
sake
carter
lived
in
loftier
state
among
these
volunteers
than
he
would
have
done
in
a
regular
regiment
miss
ravenel
was
amused
but
she
was
also
considerably
impressed
by
the
awe
with
which
he
was
regarded
by
all
who
surrounded
him
i
believe
that
all
women
admire
men
who
can
make
other
men
afraid
are
you
as
much
scared
at
the
general
as
your
officers
are
at
you
she
laughingly
asked
i
wish
i
could
see
the
general
i
will
bring
him
to
your
house
said
carter
but
this
was
one
of
the
promises
that
he
did
not
keep
that
gay
speech
of
the
young
lady
must
have
been
a
bitter
dose
to
him
as
we
know
who
are
aware
of
his
professional
disappointment
the
ladies
were
delighted
to
walk
down
the
open
ranks
on
inspection
and
survey
the
neat
packing
of
the
double
lines
of
unslung
knapsacks
it
is
like
going
through
a
milliner
shop
said
lillie
how
nicely
the
things
are
folded
they
really
have
a
great
deal
of
taste
in
arranging
the
colors
see
here
is
blue
and
red
and
grey
and
then
blue
again
with
a
black
cravat
here
and
a
white
handkerchief
there
it
is
like
the
backs
of
a
row
of
books
yes
this
box
knapsack
is
a
good
one
for
show
the
colonel
admitted
it
is
too
large
however
when
the
men
come
to
march
they
will
find
themselves
overloaded
i
shall
have
to
make
a
final
inspection
and
throw
away
a
few
tons
of
these
gewgaws
what
does
a
soldier
want
of
black
cravats
and
daguerreotypes
and
diaries
and
testaments
how
cruelly
practical
you
are
said
lillie
not
in
every
thing
responded
the
colonel
with
a
sigh
and
for
some
reason
the
young
lady
blushed
profoundly
at
the
answer
of
course
these
visits
the
regiment
the
reserve
brigade
and
its
destination
were
matters
of
frequent
conversation
at
the
ravenel
dwelling
through
some
leak
of
indiscretion
or
treachery
it
transpired
that
weitzel
was
to
oust
mouton
from
the
country
between
the
mississippi
and
the
atchafalaya
where
he
was
a
constant
menace
to
new
orleans
the
whole
city
rebel
and
loyal
argued
and
quarreled
about
the
chances
of
success
the
secessionists
were
rampant
they
said
that
mouton
had
fifteen
thousand
men
they
offered
to
bet
their
piles
that
he
would
have
new
orleans
back
in
a
month
at
every
notable
corner
and
in
front
of
every
popular
drinking
saloon
were
groups
of
tall
dark
men
carrying
heavy
canes
who
glared
at
union
officers
and
muttered
about
coming
union
defeats
pale
brunette
ladies
flouted
their
skirts
scornfully
at
sight
of
federal
uniforms
and
flounced
out
of
omnibusses
and
street
cars
defiled
by
their
presence
these
feminine
politicians
never
visited
miss
ravenel
however
intimately
they
might
have
known
her
before
the
war
and
if
they
met
her
in
the
street
they
complimented
her
with
the
same
look
of
hate
which
they
vouchsafed
to
the
flag
of
their
country
with
madame
larue
they
were
still
on
good
terms
although
they
rarely
called
at
her
house
for
fear
of
encountering
the
ravenels
this
suited
madame
purposes
precisely
she
could
thereby
be
federal
at
home
and
secessionist
abroad
you
know
my
dears
she
would
say
to
the
female
langdons
and
soul√©s
that
one
can
not
undo
one
self
of
one
own
relatives
that
would
be
unreasonable
so
i
am
obliged
to
receive
the
doctor
and
his
poor
daughter
at
my
house
but
i
understand
perfectly
that
their
society
must
be
to
you
disagreeable
therefore
i
absolve
you
though
with
pain
from
returning
my
visits
but
my
dears
i
shall
only
call
on
you
the
more
often
do
not
be
surprised
she
would
sometimes
add
if
you
see
a
federal
uniform
enter
my
door
from
time
to
time
i
have
my
objects
i
flatter
myself
that
i
shall
yet
be
of
benefit
to
the
good
cause
and
in
fact
she
did
occasionally
send
to
a
certain
secret
junto
scraps
of
information
which
she
professed
to
have
extracted
from
union
officers
this
information
was
of
no
value
it
is
even
probable
that
much
of
it
was
a
deliberate
figment
of
her
imagination
but
in
this
way
she
kept
her
political
odor
sweet
in
the
nostrils
of
the
city
secessionists
in
secret
she
cared
for
little
more
than
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
keep
her
property
she
laughed
with
delighted
malice
at
the
doctor
sarcasms
upon
the
absurdities
of
new
orleans
politics
and
the
rottenness
of
new
orleans
morals
she
sympathized
with
lillie
youthful
indignation
at
her
own
social
proscription
she
flattered
carter
professional
pride
by
predicting
his
success
in
the
field
she
satirized
colburne
behind
his
back
and
praised
him
to
his
face
for
his
catonian
principles
she
was
all
things
to
all
men
and
made
herself
generally
agreeable
meantime
lillie
had
become
what
she
called
a
federalist
for
she
was
not
yet
so
established
in
the
faith
as
to
style
it
loyalist
or
patriot
what
girl
would
not
have
been
thus
converted
driven
as
she
was
from
the
mansion
of
secession
by
its
bitter
inmates
and
drawn
towards
the
opposing
house
by
her
father
and
her
two
admirers
colonel
visits
were
frequent
and
his
influence
strong
and
increasing
notwithstanding
the
doctor
warning
tirades
it
made
her
uneasy
fretful
and
unhappy
to
disagree
with
her
father
but
on
the
subject
of
this
preference
she
positively
could
not
hold
his
opinions
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
so
unjust
she
could
not
understand
why
he
should
be
so
bitterly
and
groundlessly
prejudiced
the
reasons
which
he
hinted
at
glided
off
her
like
rain
off
a
bird
feathers
she
granted
no
faith
to
the
insinuation
that
the
colonel
was
a
bad
man
nor
had
she
credited
it
would
she
have
inferred
therefrom
that
he
would
make
a
bad
husband
let
us
not
be
astonished
at
the
delusion
of
this
intelligent
and
young
lady
i
have
witnessed
more
extraordinary
assortments
and
choices
than
this
i
have
more
than
once
seen
an
elegant
brilliant
girl
make
an
inexplicable
and
hungry
snap
at
a
man
who
was
stupidly
boorishly
viciously
her
inferior
the
subtle
and
potent
sense
which
draws
the
two
sexes
together
is
an
inexorable
despot
the
colonel
was
one
of
its
victims
although
not
quite
bereft
of
reason
still
if
he
did
not
offer
himself
to
miss
ravenel
before
going
on
this
lafourche
expedition
it
was
simply
from
considerations
of
worldly
prudence
or
as
he
phrased
it
to
himself
out
of
regard
to
her
happiness
he
thought
that
his
pay
was
insufficient
to
support
her
in
the
style
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
and
in
which
he
wished
his
wife
to
live
that
he
would
be
rejected
he
did
not
much
expect
being
a
veteran
in
love
affairs
accustomed
to
conquer
and
gifted
by
birthright
with
an
audacious
confidence
nor
did
he
so
much
as
suspect
that
he
was
not
good
enough
for
her
his
moral
perceptions
not
very
keen
perhaps
by
nature
had
been
still
further
calloused
by
years
of
wandering
in
the
wilderness
of
sin
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
people
of
staid
lives
the
colonel
did
not
even
consider
himself
a
fast
man
he
allowed
that
he
drank
yes
that
he
sometimes
drank
more
than
was
good
for
him
but
as
he
laughingly
said
he
never
took
more
than
his
regulation
quart
a
day
by
which
he
meant
that
according
to
the
army
standard
he
was
a
temperate
drinker
as
to
gambling
that
was
a
gentleman
amusement
and
moreover
he
had
done
very
little
of
it
in
the
last
year
or
two
it
was
true
that
he
had
had
various
but
then
all
men
did
that
sort
of
thing
at
times
and
under
temptation
they
did
it
more
or
less
openly
according
as
they
were
men
of
the
world
or
hypocrites
if
they
said
they
did
they
lied
the
colonel
did
not
grant
the
least
faith
to
the
story
of
joseph
or
allowing
it
to
be
true
for
the
sake
of
argument
he
considered
joseph
no
gentleman
in
short
after
inspecting
himself
fairly
and
fully
according
to
his
lights
he
concluded
that
he
was
rather
honorable
even
in
his
vices
had
he
not
for
instance
entangled
himself
in
that
affair
of
the
french
chiefly
to
get
miss
ravenel
out
of
his
head
and
so
keep
from
leading
her
and
himself
into
a
marriage
thus
though
he
was
very
frank
with
himself
he
still
concluded
that
he
was
a
tolerably
good
fellow
yes
and
there
were
many
other
persons
who
thought
him
good
enough
men
who
knew
his
ways
perfectly
but
could
not
see
much
matter
of
reproach
in
them
in
this
state
of
opinion
and
temper
of
feeling
the
colonel
approached
his
last
interview
with
miss
ravenel
he
meant
to
avoid
the
temptation
of
seeing
her
alone
on
this
occasion
but
when
larue
told
him
that
he
should
have
a
private
interview
of
half
an
hour
he
could
not
refuse
the
offer
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
lillie
was
a
party
to
the
conspiracy
madame
alone
originated
planned
and
executed
she
saw
to
it
beforehand
that
the
doctor
should
be
invited
out
she
stopped
colburne
on
the
doorstep
with
a
message
that
the
ladies
were
not
at
home
lastly
she
slipped
out
of
the
parlor
dodged
through
the
back
passage
into
the
ravenel
house
and
remained
there
thirty
minutes
by
the
watch
it
vexed
this
amiable
creature
a
trifle
that
the
colonel
should
prefer
lillie
but
since
he
would
be
so
foolish
she
was
determined
that
he
should
make
a
marriage
of
it
leaving
her
to
these
reflections
as
she
walks
the
doctor
studio
kicking
his
minerals
about
the
carpet
with
her
little
feet
or
watching
at
the
window
lest
he
should
return
unexpectedly
let
us
go
back
to
miss
ravenel
and
her
still
undecided
lover
it
was
understood
that
the
expedition
was
to
sail
the
next
day
although
carter
had
not
said
so
not
being
a
man
to
tattle
official
secrets
when
therefore
he
entered
the
house
that
evening
she
felt
a
vague
dread
of
him
as
if
half
comprehending
that
the
occasion
might
lead
him
to
say
something
decisive
of
her
future
carter
on
his
part
knew
that
he
would
not
be
interrupted
for
a
reasonable
number
of
minutes
and
as
larue
left
the
room
the
sense
of
opportunity
rushed
upon
him
like
a
flood
of
temptation
he
forgot
in
an
instant
that
she
was
poor
that
he
was
poor
and
extravagant
and
that
a
marriage
would
be
the
maddest
of
follies
compared
with
which
all
his
extravagancies
were
acts
of
sedate
wisdom
he
was
now
what
he
always
had
been
and
what
people
of
strong
passions
very
frequently
are
the
victim
of
chance
and
juxtaposition
he
rose
from
the
sofa
where
he
had
been
sitting
and
worrying
his
cap
walked
straight
across
the
room
with
a
firm
step
like
the
resolute
irresistible
advance
of
a
veteran
regiment
and
took
a
chair
beside
her
miss
ravenel
he
said
and
stopped
there
was
more
profound
feeling
in
his
voice
and
face
than
we
have
yet
seen
him
exhibit
in
this
history
there
was
so
much
and
it
was
so
electrical
in
its
nature
at
least
as
regarded
her
that
she
trembled
in
body
and
spirit
miss
ravenel
he
resumed
i
did
intend
to
go
to
this
battle
without
saying
one
word
of
love
to
you
but
i
can
not
do
it
you
see
i
can
not
do
it
such
a
moment
as
this
is
one
of
the
supreme
moments
of
a
woman
life
there
is
a
fulfillment
of
hope
which
is
thrillingly
delicious
there
is
a
demand
amounting
to
a
decree
which
involves
her
whole
being
her
whole
future
there
is
a
surprise
it
is
always
a
surprise
which
is
so
sudden
and
great
that
it
falls
like
a
terror
a
pure
and
loving
girl
who
receives
a
first
declaration
of
love
from
the
man
whom
she
has
secretly
chosen
out
of
all
men
as
the
keeper
of
her
heart
is
in
a
condition
of
soul
which
makes
her
womanhood
all
ecstacy
there
is
not
a
nerve
in
her
brain
not
a
drop
of
blood
in
her
body
which
does
not
go
delirious
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
she
does
not
seem
really
to
see
nor
to
hear
nor
to
speak
but
only
to
feel
that
presence
and
those
words
and
her
own
reply
to
feel
them
all
by
some
new
miraculous
sense
such
as
we
are
conscious
of
in
dreams
when
things
are
communicated
to
us
and
by
us
without
touch
or
voice
it
is
a
mere
palpitation
of
feeling
yet
full
of
utterances
a
throbbing
of
happiness
so
acute
and
startling
as
to
be
almost
pain
that
man
has
no
just
comprehension
of
this
moment
or
is
very
unworthy
of
the
power
vested
in
his
manhood
who
can
awaken
such
emotions
merely
for
a
passing
pleasure
or
blight
them
afterward
by
unfaithfulness
and
neglect
in
one
sense
carter
was
as
noble
as
his
triumph
he
was
not
a
good
man
but
he
could
love
fervently
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
timorous
but
understood
her
although
she
did
not
answer
precisely
because
she
did
not
speak
because
he
saw
that
she
could
not
speak
because
he
felt
that
no
more
speech
was
necessary
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
the
color
which
had
left
her
skin
came
back
to
it
and
burned
like
a
flame
in
her
face
and
neck
may
i
write
to
you
when
i
am
away
he
asked
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
with
an
expression
of
loving
gratitude
which
no
words
could
utter
she
tried
to
speak
but
she
could
only
whisper
oh
i
should
be
so
happy
then
my
dear
my
dearest
one
remember
that
i
am
yours
and
try
to
feel
that
you
are
mine
i
shall
go
no
farther
in
the
description
of
this
interview
chapter
xv
lillie
bids
to
the
lover
whom
she
has
chosen
and
to
the
lover
whom
she
would
not
choose
lillie
left
larue
early
without
a
word
as
to
the
great
event
which
had
just
changed
the
world
for
her
and
retired
to
her
own
house
and
her
own
room
she
was
in
a
state
of
being
half
stunned
half
ecstatic
every
faculty
seemed
to
be
suspended
except
so
far
as
it
was
electrified
to
action
by
one
idea
she
sat
by
the
window
with
folded
hands
motionless
seeing
and
hearing
only
through
her
memory
she
sought
to
recollect
him
as
he
was
when
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
she
called
to
mind
all
that
he
had
said
and
looked
and
done
she
could
not
tell
whether
she
had
been
thus
occupied
five
minutes
or
half
an
hour
when
she
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
followed
by
her
father
entrance
then
suddenly
a
great
terror
and
sense
of
guilt
fell
upon
her
spirit
from
the
moment
when
that
confession
of
love
had
been
uttered
down
to
this
moment
her
mind
had
been
occupied
by
but
one
human
being
and
that
was
her
lover
now
for
the
first
time
during
the
evening
she
recollected
that
the
man
of
her
choice
was
not
the
man
of
her
father
choice
but
more
than
almost
any
other
person
the
object
of
his
suspicion
if
not
of
his
aversion
yet
she
loved
them
both
she
could
not
take
sides
with
one
against
the
other
it
would
kill
her
to
give
up
the
affection
of
either
all
impulse
all
passion
blood
and
brain
as
tremulous
as
quicksilver
she
ran
down
stairs
opened
the
door
into
the
study
where
the
doctor
stood
among
his
boxes
wavered
backward
under
a
momentary
throb
of
fear
then
sprang
forward
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
sobbed
upon
his
shoulder
oh
papa
i
am
so
happy
so
miserable
the
doctor
stared
in
astonishment
and
in
some
vague
alarm
hardly
aware
of
how
much
energy
he
used
he
detached
her
from
him
and
held
her
out
at
arm
length
looking
anxiously
at
her
for
an
explanation
oh
do
push
me
away
begged
lillie
and
struggled
back
to
him
trying
to
hide
her
face
against
his
breast
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
fell
across
the
doctor
but
he
strove
to
fling
it
from
him
as
one
dashes
off
a
disagreeable
reptile
still
he
looked
quite
nervous
and
apprehensive
as
he
said
what
is
it
my
child
carter
will
tell
you
she
whispered
then
before
he
could
speak
do
love
him
for
my
sake
he
pushed
her
sobbing
into
a
chair
and
turned
his
back
on
her
with
a
groan
oh
man
i
ca
i
wo
he
walked
several
times
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
and
then
broke
out
again
i
can
consent
i
will
consent
it
is
my
duty
oh
lillie
how
could
you
choose
the
very
man
of
all
that
i
tell
you
this
must
not
be
it
must
stop
here
i
have
confidence
in
him
he
will
make
you
happy
he
will
make
you
miserable
i
tell
you
that
you
will
regret
the
day
that
you
marry
him
to
the
last
moment
of
your
life
my
child
persuasively
you
believe
me
you
trust
my
judgment
will
you
not
be
persuaded
will
you
not
stop
where
you
are
he
ceased
his
walk
and
gazed
eagerly
at
her
hoping
for
some
affirmative
sign
as
may
be
supposed
lillie
could
not
give
it
she
could
make
no
very
distinct
signs
just
then
either
one
way
or
the
other
she
did
not
speak
nor
look
at
him
nor
shake
her
head
nor
nod
it
she
only
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sobbed
then
the
doctor
feeling
himself
to
be
forsaken
and
acknowledging
it
by
outward
dumb
show
after
the
manner
of
men
who
are
greatly
moved
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
sat
down
by
himself
and
dropped
his
head
into
his
hands
as
if
accepting
utter
loneliness
in
the
world
lillie
gave
him
one
glance
in
his
acknowledged
extremity
of
desertion
and
running
to
him
knelt
at
his
feet
and
laid
her
head
against
his
she
was
certainly
the
most
unhappy
of
the
two
but
her
eagerness
was
even
stronger
than
her
misery
oh
papa
do
you
hate
him
so
i
do
hate
him
i
dread
him
i
suspect
him
i
know
he
will
not
make
you
happy
i
know
he
will
make
you
miserable
but
why
perhaps
he
can
explain
it
tell
him
what
you
think
papa
i
am
sure
he
can
explain
every
thing
but
the
doctor
only
groaned
rose
up
disentangled
himself
from
his
daughter
and
leaving
her
there
on
the
floor
continued
his
doleful
walk
never
having
really
feared
what
had
come
to
pass
but
only
given
occasional
thought
to
it
as
a
possible
though
improbable
calamity
he
had
not
inquired
strictly
into
carter
manner
of
life
and
so
had
nothing
definite
to
allege
against
him
at
the
same
time
he
knew
perfectly
well
from
trifling
circumstances
incidental
remarks
general
air
and
bearing
that
he
was
one
of
the
class
known
in
the
world
as
men
about
town
a
class
not
only
obnoxious
to
the
doctor
moral
sentiments
as
the
antipodes
of
his
own
purity
but
also
as
being
a
natural
product
of
that
slaveholding
system
which
he
regarded
as
a
compendium
of
injustice
and
wickedness
a
class
the
members
of
which
were
constantly
coming
to
grief
and
bringing
sorrow
upon
those
who
held
them
in
affection
he
knew
them
he
had
watched
and
disliked
them
since
his
childhood
he
was
familiar
by
unpleasant
observation
with
their
language
feelings
and
doings
he
knew
where
they
began
how
they
went
on
and
in
what
sort
they
ended
the
calamities
which
they
wrought
for
themselves
and
all
who
were
connected
with
them
he
had
witnessed
in
a
hundred
similar
and
so
to
speak
reflected
instances
he
remembered
young
hammersley
who
had
sunk
down
in
drunken
paralysis
and
burned
his
feet
to
a
crisp
at
his
father
fire
young
ellicot
had
dashed
out
his
brains
by
leaping
from
a
fourth
story
window
in
a
fit
of
delirium
tremens
tom
akers
was
shot
dead
while
drunk
by
a
negro
whom
he
had
horribly
tortured
fred
sanderson
beat
his
wife
until
she
left
him
spent
his
property
at
bars
and
and
died
in
cuba
with
walker
others
he
recollected
by
the
dozen
it
seemed
to
him
who
had
fallen
wild
with
whiskey
in
broils
or
savage
street
rencontres
those
who
lived
to
grow
old
had
children
whom
they
either
shamelessly
acknowledged
or
more
shamelessly
ignored
and
perhaps
sold
at
the
they
were
drunkards
gamblers
adulterers
murderers
of
such
was
the
kingdom
of
hell
and
this
man
to
whom
his
only
child
his
lillie
had
entrusted
her
heart
was
he
feared
he
almost
knew
one
of
that
same
class
although
not
it
was
to
be
hoped
so
deeply
stained
with
the
brutish
forms
of
vice
which
flow
directly
from
slavery
he
could
not
entrust
her
to
him
he
could
not
accept
him
as
a
son
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
in
this
interview
make
any
distinct
charges
against
his
life
and
character
accordingly
his
talk
was
vague
incoherent
and
sounded
to
lillie
like
the
frettings
of
groundless
prejudice
the
painful
interview
lasted
above
an
hour
and
so
far
as
concerned
a
decision
ended
precisely
where
it
began
go
to
your
bed
my
child
the
doctor
said
at
last
and
go
to
sleep
if
you
can
you
will
cry
yourself
sick
she
gave
him
a
silent
kiss
wet
with
tears
and
went
away
with
an
aching
heart
and
a
wearied
frame
for
two
hours
or
more
the
doctor
continued
his
miserable
walk
up
and
down
the
study
from
the
door
to
the
window
from
corner
to
corner
occasionally
stopping
to
rest
a
tired
body
which
yet
had
no
longing
for
slumber
he
went
back
over
his
daughter
life
beginning
with
the
infantile
days
when
he
used
to
send
the
servant
away
from
the
cradle
in
which
she
lay
and
rock
it
himself
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
watching
her
he
remembered
how
she
had
expanded
into
the
whole
of
his
heart
when
her
mother
died
he
thought
how
solely
he
had
loved
her
since
that
bereavement
and
how
her
love
for
him
had
grown
with
her
growth
and
strengthened
with
every
maturing
power
of
her
spirit
in
the
enthusiasm
the
confidence
of
this
recollection
he
did
not
doubt
at
moments
but
that
he
could
win
her
back
to
himself
from
this
misplaced
affection
she
was
so
young
yet
her
heart
must
be
so
pliable
yet
that
he
could
surely
influence
her
as
this
comforting
hope
stole
through
him
he
felt
a
desire
to
look
at
her
yes
he
must
see
her
again
before
he
could
get
to
sleep
he
would
go
gently
to
her
room
and
gaze
at
her
without
waking
her
putting
on
his
slippers
he
crept
softly
up
stairs
and
opened
her
door
without
noise
by
the
light
of
a
dying
candle
he
saw
lillie
in
her
night
dress
sitting
up
in
bed
and
wiping
the
tears
from
her
cheeks
with
her
hands
papa
she
said
in
an
eager
gasp
tremulous
with
affection
grief
and
hope
oh
my
child
i
thought
you
would
be
asleep
he
answered
advancing
to
the
bedside
you
are
not
very
angry
with
me
she
asked
making
him
sit
down
by
her
no
not
angry
but
so
grieved
then
may
he
not
write
to
me
she
looked
so
loving
so
eager
so
sorrowful
that
he
could
not
say
no
yes
he
may
write
she
drew
his
head
towards
her
with
her
wet
hands
and
gave
him
a
kiss
the
very
gratitude
of
which
pained
him
but
not
you
he
added
trying
to
be
stern
you
must
not
write
you
must
not
entangle
yourself
farther
i
want
to
make
inquiries
i
must
have
time
in
this
matter
i
will
not
be
hurried
you
must
not
consider
yourself
engaged
lillie
i
can
not
allow
it
oh
you
inquire
papa
implored
the
girl
confident
that
carter
character
would
come
unharmed
out
of
the
furnace
of
investigation
yes
yes
but
give
me
time
this
is
too
important
too
solemn
a
matter
to
be
hurried
over
i
will
see
i
will
decide
hereafter
there
now
you
must
go
to
sleep
good
night
my
darling
good
night
dear
papa
she
murmured
with
the
sigh
of
a
tired
child
forgive
me
it
was
near
morning
before
either
of
them
slept
and
both
came
to
the
breakfast
table
with
pale
wearied
faces
there
were
dark
circles
around
lillie
eyes
and
her
head
ached
so
that
she
could
hardly
hold
it
up
but
still
she
put
on
a
piteous
propitiating
smile
she
hoped
and
feared
unreasonable
things
every
time
that
her
father
spoke
or
seemed
to
her
to
be
about
to
speak
she
thought
he
might
say
that
he
had
given
up
all
his
opposition
and
in
the
same
breath
she
dreaded
lest
he
might
declare
that
it
must
be
all
over
forever
but
the
conversation
of
the
evening
was
not
resumed
and
the
meal
passed
in
absorbed
anxious
embarrassing
silence
neither
being
able
to
talk
on
any
subject
but
the
one
which
filled
their
thoughts
an
hour
later
lillie
suddenly
fled
from
the
parlor
to
her
own
room
she
had
seen
carter
approaching
the
house
she
felt
certain
that
he
came
to
demand
her
of
her
father
and
at
such
an
interview
she
could
not
have
been
present
she
thought
without
dying
the
mere
thought
of
it
as
she
sat
by
her
window
looking
out
without
seeing
anything
made
her
breath
come
so
painfully
that
she
wondered
whether
her
lungs
were
not
affected
and
whether
she
were
not
destined
to
die
early
her
fatigue
and
still
more
her
troubles
made
her
babyish
like
an
invalid
after
half
an
hour
had
passed
she
heard
the
outer
door
close
upon
the
visitor
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
peeping
out
to
see
him
if
it
were
only
his
back
he
was
looking
with
those
handsome
and
audacious
eyes
of
his
straight
at
her
window
with
a
sudden
throb
of
alarm
or
shame
or
some
other
womanish
emotion
she
hid
herself
behind
the
curtain
only
to
look
out
again
when
he
had
disappeared
and
to
grieve
lest
she
had
given
him
offence
after
a
while
her
father
called
her
and
she
went
down
trembling
to
the
parlor
i
have
seen
him
said
the
doctor
i
told
him
what
i
told
you
i
told
him
that
i
must
wait
that
i
wanted
time
for
reflection
i
gave
him
to
understand
that
it
must
not
be
considered
an
engagement
at
the
same
time
i
allowed
him
to
write
to
you
god
forgive
me
if
i
have
done
wrong
god
pity
us
both
lillie
did
not
think
of
asking
if
he
had
been
civil
to
the
colonel
she
knew
that
he
would
not
and
could
not
be
discourteous
to
any
human
being
she
made
no
answer
to
what
he
said
except
by
going
gently
to
him
and
kissing
him
come
you
must
dress
yourself
he
added
the
regiment
goes
on
board
the
transport
at
twelve
i
promised
the
colonel
that
we
would
be
there
to
bid
him
and
captain
colburne
dressing
for
the
street
was
usually
a
long
operation
with
lillie
but
not
this
morning
although
she
reached
the
station
of
the
carrollton
railroad
in
a
breathless
condition
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
father
had
never
walked
so
slowly
and
on
board
the
cars
she
really
fatigued
herself
with
the
nervous
tension
of
an
involuntary
mental
effort
to
push
forward
the
wheezy
engine
carrollton
is
one
the
suburban
offshoots
of
new
orleans
and
contains
some
two
thousand
inhabitants
mostly
of
the
poorer
classes
and
of
germanic
lineage
around
it
stretches
the
tame
rich
dead
level
which
constitutes
southern
louisiana
the
only
raised
ground
is
the
levee
the
only
grand
feature
of
the
landscape
is
the
mississippi
all
the
rest
is
greenery
cypress
groves
orange
thickets
flowers
or
bare
flatness
as
lillie
emerged
from
the
brick
and
plaster
she
saw
the
tenth
and
its
companion
regiments
along
the
levee
the
men
sitting
down
in
their
ranks
and
waiting
patiently
after
the
manner
of
soldiers
the
narrow
open
place
between
the
river
and
the
dusty
little
suburb
was
thronged
with
citizens
german
shopkeepers
silversmiths
who
were
out
of
custom
and
irish
laborers
who
were
out
of
work
poor
women
whose
husbands
were
in
the
rebel
army
selling
miserable
cakes
and
beer
to
the
enlisted
men
all
white
as
well
as
black
ragged
dirty
lounging
listless
hopeless
none
of
them
hostile
at
least
not
in
manner
a
discouraged
subduced
stricken
population
against
the
bank
were
moored
six
steamboats
their
and
even
their
upper
decks
overlooking
the
low
landscape
they
were
not
the
famous
floating
palaces
of
the
mississippi
those
had
all
been
carried
away
by
lovell
or
burnt
at
the
wharves
or
sunk
in
battle
near
the
forts
these
were
smaller
craft
such
as
formerly
brought
cotton
down
the
red
river
or
threaded
the
shallows
between
lake
pontchartrain
and
mobile
they
looked
more
fragile
even
than
northern
steamboats
their
boilers
and
machinery
were
unenclosed
visible
neglected
ugly
the
superstructure
was
a
of
stanchions
and
clapboards
the
doctor
led
lillie
through
the
crowd
to
a
pile
of
lumber
which
promised
a
view
of
the
scene
as
she
mounted
the
humble
lookout
she
caught
sight
of
a
manly
equestrian
figure
and
heard
a
powerful
bass
voice
thunder
out
a
sentence
of
command
it
was
so
guttural
as
to
be
incomprehensible
to
her
but
in
obedience
to
it
the
lounging
soldiers
sprang
to
their
feet
and
resumed
their
ranks
the
shining
muskets
rose
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
then
took
a
uniform
slope
there
was
a
bustle
a
momentary
mingling
and
she
saw
knapsacks
instead
of
faces
battalion
the
colonel
had
commanded
shoulder
arms
right
shoulder
shift
arms
right
face
he
now
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
adjutant
who
repeated
the
orders
to
the
captains
and
then
signalled
to
the
to
the
sound
of
drum
and
fife
the
right
company
followed
successively
by
the
others
from
right
to
left
filed
down
the
little
slope
with
a
regular
resounding
tramp
and
rapidly
crowded
one
of
the
transports
with
blue
uniforms
and
shining
rifles
how
superb
in
lillie
eyes
was
the
colonel
though
his
face
was
grim
and
his
voice
harsh
with
arbitrary
power
she
liked
him
for
his
bronzed
color
his
monstrous
mustache
his
air
of
matured
manhood
yes
how
much
better
she
liked
him
for
being
years
old
than
if
he
had
been
only
how
much
prouder
of
him
was
she
because
she
was
a
little
afraid
of
him
than
if
he
had
seemed
one
whom
she
might
govern
presently
a
brilliant
blush
rose
like
a
sunrise
upon
her
countenance
carter
had
caught
sight
of
them
and
was
approaching
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
a
stare
of
his
imperious
eyes
drove
away
the
flock
of
negroes
who
had
crowded
their
lookout
the
interview
was
short
and
to
a
listener
would
have
been
uninteresting
unless
he
had
known
the
sentimental
relations
of
the
parties
the
doctor
did
nearly
all
of
that
part
of
the
talking
which
was
done
in
words
and
his
observations
if
they
were
noted
at
all
probably
seemed
to
the
other
two
mere
flatness
and
irrelevancy
he
prophecied
success
to
the
expedition
he
wished
the
colonel
success
for
the
sake
of
the
good
cause
finally
he
warmed
so
far
as
to
wish
him
personal
success
and
safety
but
what
was
even
this
to
that
other
question
of
union
or
separation
for
life
presently
the
adjutant
approached
with
a
salute
and
reported
that
the
transport
would
not
accommodate
the
whole
regiment
it
must
said
the
colonel
the
men
are
not
properly
stowed
i
suppose
they
wo
stow
they
learned
yet
that
they
ca
have
a
apiece
i
will
attend
to
it
adjutant
turning
to
the
ravenels
he
added
i
suppose
i
must
bid
you
i
shall
have
little
more
time
to
myself
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
to
see
us
off
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
when
a
man
of
the
colonel
nature
utters
this
benediction
seriously
he
is
unquestionably
much
more
moved
than
ordinarily
lillie
felt
this
not
that
she
considered
carter
wicked
but
simply
more
masculine
than
most
men
and
she
was
so
much
shaken
by
his
unusual
emotion
that
she
could
hardly
forbear
bursting
into
tears
in
public
when
he
was
gone
she
would
have
been
glad
to
fly
immediately
if
only
she
could
have
found
a
place
where
she
might
be
alone
then
she
had
to
compose
herself
to
meet
colburne
the
colonel
sent
me
to
take
care
of
you
he
said
as
he
joined
them
how
good
of
him
thought
lillie
meaning
thereby
carter
and
not
the
captain
will
they
all
get
on
board
this
boat
she
inquired
yes
they
are
moving
on
now
the
men
of
course
hate
to
stow
close
and
it
needed
the
colonel
to
make
them
do
it
it
looks
awfully
crowded
she
answered
searching
the
whole
craft
over
for
a
glimpse
of
carter
the
doctor
had
little
to
say
and
seemed
quite
sad
he
was
actually
thinking
how
much
easier
he
could
have
loved
this
one
than
the
other
colburne
knew
nothing
of
the
great
event
of
the
previous
evening
and
so
was
not
miserable
about
it
he
hoped
to
send
back
to
this
girl
such
a
good
report
of
himself
from
the
field
of
impending
battle
as
should
exact
her
admiration
and
perhaps
force
her
heart
to
salute
him
imperator
he
was
elated
and
confident
boasted
of
the
soldierly
determined
look
of
the
men
pointed
out
his
own
company
with
pride
prophesied
brilliant
success
when
at
last
he
bade
them
he
did
it
in
a
light
kindly
brave
way
which
was
meant
to
cheer
up
miss
ravenel
under
any
possible
cloud
of
foreboding
i
wo
say
anything
about
being
brought
back
on
my
shield
i
ever
promise
that
there
shall
be
enough
left
to
fill
a
yet
the
heart
felt
a
pang
of
something
like
remorse
for
this
counterfeit
gayety
of
the
lips
the
gangway
plank
was
hauled
in
a
few
stragglers
leaped
aboard
at
the
risk
of
a
ducking
the
regimental
band
on
the
upper
deck
struck
up
a
national
air
the
negroes
on
shore
danced
and
cackled
and
screamed
with
childish
delight
the
noisy
engine
began
to
sob
and
groan
like
a
demon
in
pain
the
boat
veered
slowly
into
the
stream
and
followed
its
consorts
two
gunboats
and
six
transports
steamed
up
the
yellow
river
trailing
columns
of
black
smoke
athwart
the
blue
sky
and
away
over
the
green
levels
of
louisiana
now
came
nearly
a
week
of
anxiety
to
lillie
and
trouble
to
her
father
she
was
with
him
as
much
as
possible
partly
because
that
was
her
old
and
loving
habit
and
partly
because
she
wanted
him
continually
at
hand
to
comfort
her
she
was
not
satisfied
with
seeing
him
morning
and
evening
she
must
visit
him
at
the
hospitals
and
go
back
and
forth
with
him
on
the
street
cars
she
must
hear
from
him
every
half
hour
that
there
was
no
danger
of
evil
tidings
as
if
he
were
a
newspaper
issued
by
extras
she
must
keep
at
him
with
questions
that
no
man
could
answer
papa
do
you
believe
that
mouton
has
fifteen
thousand
men
do
you
believe
that
there
will
be
a
great
battle
do
you
believe
that
our
side
she
could
call
it
side
now
will
be
beaten
do
you
believe
that
our
loss
will
be
very
heavy
what
is
the
usual
proportion
of
killed
in
a
battle
you
do
know
well
but
what
are
the
probabilities
if
he
took
up
a
book
or
opened
his
cases
of
minerals
it
was
oh
please
do
read
or
please
let
those
stones
alone
i
want
you
to
talk
to
me
when
do
you
suppose
the
battle
will
happen
when
shall
we
get
the
first
news
when
shall
we
get
the
particulars
and
so
she
kept
questioning
she
was
enough
to
worry
the
life
out
of
papa
but
then
he
was
accustomed
to
be
thus
worried
he
was
a
most
patient
man
even
in
the
bosom
of
his
own
family
which
is
not
so
common
a
trait
as
many
persons
suppose
one
afternoon
those
sallow
hectors
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
who
looked
so
much
like
gamblers
and
talked
so
much
like
traitors
had
an
air
of
elation
which
scared
miss
ravenel
and
she
accordingly
hurried
home
to
receive
a
confirmation
of
her
fears
from
larue
who
had
heard
that
there
had
been
a
great
battle
near
thibodeaux
that
weitzel
had
been
defeated
and
that
mouton
would
certainly
be
in
the
city
by
next
day
afternoon
for
an
hour
she
was
in
an
agony
of
unalleviated
terror
for
her
comforter
had
not
returned
from
the
hospital
when
he
came
she
flew
upon
him
and
ravenously
demanded
consolation
my
dear
you
must
not
be
so
childish
remonstrated
the
doctor
you
must
have
more
nerve
or
you
wo
last
the
year
out
but
what
will
become
of
you
if
mouton
comes
here
you
will
be
sacrificed
you
and
all
the
union
men
i
wish
you
would
take
refuge
on
board
some
of
the
ships
of
war
do
go
and
see
if
they
will
take
you
i
sha
be
hurt
i
can
get
along
ravenel
laughed
my
dear
you
gone
back
to
your
babyhood
i
do
believe
this
story
at
all
when
the
time
comes
i
will
look
out
for
the
safety
of
both
of
us
but
do
please
go
somewhere
and
see
if
you
ca
hear
something
and
when
the
doctor
was
thus
driven
to
pick
up
his
hat
she
took
hers
also
and
accompanied
him
not
being
able
to
wait
for
the
news
until
his
return
they
could
learn
nothing
the
journals
had
no
bulletins
out
the
union
banker
barker
had
nothing
to
communicate
they
looked
wistfully
at
headquarters
but
did
not
dare
to
intrude
upon
general
butler
as
they
went
homeward
the
knots
of
catilines
at
the
corners
carried
their
treasonable
heads
as
high
and
stared
at
federal
uniforms
as
insolently
as
ever
ravenel
thought
sadly
how
much
they
resembled
in
air
the
gentleman
to
whom
he
feared
that
he
should
have
to
trust
the
happiness
of
his
only
child
those
of
them
who
knew
him
did
not
speak
nor
bow
but
glared
at
him
as
a
pawnee
might
glare
at
the
captive
hunter
around
whose
stake
he
expected
to
dance
on
the
morrow
evidently
his
life
would
be
in
peril
if
mouton
should
enter
the
city
but
he
was
a
sanguine
man
and
did
not
believe
in
the
calamity
next
morning
as
the
father
set
off
for
the
hospital
the
daughter
said
if
you
hear
any
thing
do
come
right
straight
and
tell
me
twenty
minutes
afterward
ravenel
was
back
at
the
house
breathless
and
radiant
weitzel
had
gained
a
victory
had
taken
cannon
and
hundreds
of
prisoners
was
in
full
march
on
the
rebel
capital
thibodeaux
oh
i
am
so
happy
cried
the
heretofore
secessionist
but
is
there
no
list
of
killed
and
wounded
has
our
loss
been
heavy
what
do
you
think
what
do
you
think
are
the
probabilities
how
strange
that
there
should
be
no
list
of
killed
and
wounded
was
that
positively
all
that
you
heard
so
little
oh
papa
do
please
go
to
the
hospital
i
ca
bear
to
stay
well
if
you
must
go
i
will
go
with
you
and
go
she
did
but
left
him
in
half
an
hour
after
she
got
there
crazy
to
be
near
the
bulletin
boards
during
the
day
she
bought
all
the
extras
and
read
four
descriptions
of
the
battle
all
precisely
alike
because
copied
from
the
same
official
bulletin
and
all
unsatisfactory
because
they
did
not
contain
lists
of
killed
and
wounded
but
at
the
just
before
it
closed
she
was
rewarded
for
that
long
day
of
wearying
inquiries
there
was
a
letter
from
carter
to
herself
and
another
from
colburne
to
her
father
my
dear
lillie
began
the
first
and
here
she
paused
to
kiss
the
words
and
wipe
away
the
tears
we
have
had
a
smart
little
fight
and
whipped
the
enemy
handsomely
weitzel
managed
matters
in
a
way
that
really
does
him
great
credit
and
the
results
are
one
cannon
three
hundred
prisoners
possession
of
the
killed
and
wounded
and
of
the
field
of
battle
our
loss
was
trifling
and
includes
no
one
whom
you
know
life
and
limb
being
now
doubly
valuable
to
me
for
your
sake
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
i
did
not
get
hurt
i
am
tired
and
have
a
great
deal
to
do
so
that
i
can
only
scratch
you
a
line
but
you
must
believe
me
and
i
know
that
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
the
heart
to
write
you
a
dozen
sheets
instead
of
only
a
dozen
sentences
good
bye
my
dear
one
ever
and
altogether
yours
it
was
lillie
first
love
letter
it
was
from
a
lover
who
had
just
come
unharmed
out
of
the
perils
of
battle
it
was
a
blinding
thrilling
page
to
read
she
would
not
let
her
father
take
it
no
that
was
not
in
the
agreement
at
all
it
was
too
sacred
even
for
his
eyes
but
she
read
it
to
him
all
but
those
words
of
endearment
all
but
those
very
words
that
to
her
were
the
most
precious
of
all
in
return
he
handed
her
colburne
epistle
which
was
also
brief
my
dear
doctor
i
have
had
the
greatest
pleasure
of
my
whole
life
i
have
fought
under
the
flag
of
my
country
and
seen
it
victorious
i
have
not
time
to
write
particulars
but
you
will
of
course
get
them
in
the
papers
our
regiment
behaved
most
nobly
our
colonel
proved
himself
a
hero
and
our
general
a
genius
we
are
encamped
for
the
night
on
the
field
of
battle
cold
and
hungry
but
brimming
over
with
pride
and
happiness
there
may
be
another
battle
but
be
sure
that
we
shall
conquer
our
men
were
greenhorns
yesterday
but
they
are
veterans
and
will
face
any
thing
ask
miss
ravenel
if
she
will
not
turn
loyal
for
the
sake
of
our
gallant
little
army
it
deserves
even
that
compliment
truly
yours
he
does
say
that
he
is
unhurt
observed
the
doctor
of
course
he
is
answered
lillie
not
willing
to
suppose
for
him
the
honor
of
a
wound
when
her
paragon
had
none
colonel
carter
says
that
the
loss
includes
no
one
whom
we
know
he
is
a
noble
fellow
pursued
the
doctor
still
dwelling
on
the
young
man
magnanimity
in
not
thinking
to
speak
of
himself
he
is
the
most
truly
heroic
chivalrous
gentleman
that
i
know
he
is
one
of
noblemen
lillie
was
piqued
at
these
praises
of
colburne
not
considering
him
half
so
fine
a
character
as
carter
in
eulogy
of
whom
her
father
said
nothing
she
thought
of
asking
him
if
he
had
noticed
how
the
captain
spoke
of
the
colonel
as
a
hero
but
concluded
not
to
do
it
for
fear
he
might
reply
that
the
latter
ought
to
have
paid
the
former
the
same
compliment
she
felt
that
for
the
present
until
her
father
prejudices
should
wear
away
she
must
be
contented
with
deifying
her
achilles
alone
notwithstanding
this
pettish
annoyance
grievous
as
it
was
to
a
most
loving
spirit
strongly
desirous
of
sympathy
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
delightfully
the
time
being
divided
between
frequent
readings
of
carter
letter
and
intervals
of
meditation
thereon
the
epistle
which
her
father
wrote
to
the
colonel
was
also
thoroughly
read
and
was
in
fact
so
emendated
and
enlarged
by
her
suggestions
that
it
might
be
considered
her
composition
chapter
xvi
colonel
carter
gains
one
victory
and
miss
ravenel
another
after
the
victory
of
georgia
landing
the
brigade
was
stationed
for
the
winter
in
the
vicinity
of
the
little
city
of
thibodeaux
i
have
not
time
to
tell
of
the
sacking
of
this
land
of
rich
plantations
how
the
inhabitants
by
flying
before
the
northern
vandals
induced
the
spoliation
of
their
own
property
how
the
negroes
defiled
and
plundered
the
forsaken
houses
and
how
the
soldiers
thereby
justified
themselves
in
plundering
the
negroes
how
the
furniture
plate
and
libraries
of
the
lafourche
planters
were
thus
scattered
upon
the
winds
of
destruction
these
things
are
matters
of
public
and
not
of
private
history
if
i
were
writing
the
life
and
times
of
colonel
carter
or
of
captain
colburne
i
should
relate
them
with
conscientious
tediousness
adding
a
description
in
the
best
style
of
modern
of
the
winding
and
muddy
bayou
lafourche
the
interminable
parallel
levees
the
flat
border
of
rich
bottom
land
the
fields
of
moving
cane
and
the
enclosing
stretches
of
swampy
forest
but
i
am
simply
writing
a
biography
of
miss
ravenel
illustrated
by
sketches
of
her
three
or
four
relatives
and
intimates
to
reward
colonel
carter
for
his
gallantry
at
georgia
landing
and
to
compensate
him
for
his
disappointment
in
not
obtaining
the
star
of
a
brigadier
the
commanding
general
appointed
him
military
governor
of
louisiana
and
stationed
him
at
new
orleans
in
his
present
temper
and
with
his
present
intentions
he
was
sincerely
delighted
to
obtain
the
generous
loot
of
the
governorship
in
order
to
save
up
money
for
his
approaching
married
life
he
tried
to
be
economical
and
actually
thought
that
he
was
so
although
he
regularly
spent
the
monthly
two
hundred
and
dollars
of
his
colonelcy
but
the
position
of
governor
would
give
him
several
thousands
a
year
and
these
thousands
he
could
and
would
put
aside
to
comfort
and
adorn
his
future
wife
there
was
no
private
and
unwarrantable
attachment
to
his
housekeeping
establishment
the
pure
love
that
was
in
his
heart
overthrew
and
drove
out
all
the
unclean
spirits
who
were
its
enemies
moreover
he
rapidly
cut
down
his
drinking
habits
first
pruning
off
his
cocktails
before
breakfast
then
his
absinthe
before
dinner
then
his
afternoon
whiskeys
straight
then
his
convivial
evening
punches
and
in
short
everything
but
the
hot
with
which
he
prepared
himself
for
slumber
that
may
have
to
go
too
he
said
to
himself
when
i
am
married
he
spent
every
spare
moment
with
lillie
and
her
father
he
was
quite
happy
in
his
sanctification
of
spirit
and
showed
it
in
his
air
countenance
and
conversation
man
of
the
world
as
he
was
or
thought
he
was
as
he
had
been
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
at
the
change
which
had
come
over
him
nor
to
laugh
at
himself
because
of
it
to
a
nature
so
simply
passionate
as
his
the
present
hour
of
passion
was
the
only
hour
that
he
could
realize
he
shortly
came
to
feel
as
if
he
had
never
lived
any
other
life
than
this
which
he
was
living
now
the
doctor
soon
lost
his
keen
distrust
of
carter
he
began
to
respect
him
and
consequently
to
like
him
indeed
he
could
not
help
being
pleased
with
any
tolerable
person
who
pleased
his
daughter
although
he
sometimes
exhibited
a
petulant
jealousy
of
such
persons
which
was
droll
enough
considering
that
he
was
only
her
father
papa
i
believe
you
would
be
severe
on
cecilia
or
ursula
if
i
should
get
intimate
with
them
lillie
had
once
said
i
never
had
a
particular
friend
since
i
was
a
baby
but
what
you
picked
her
to
pieces
and
the
doctor
had
in
reply
looked
a
little
indignant
not
perceiving
the
justice
of
the
criticism
by
the
way
lillie
had
a
similar
jealousy
of
him
and
was
ready
to
slander
any
single
woman
who
ogled
him
too
fondly
there
were
moments
of
great
anguish
when
she
feared
that
he
might
be
inveigled
into
admiring
perhaps
loving
perhaps
horrid
thought
marrying
larue
if
it
ever
occurred
to
her
that
this
would
be
a
poetically
just
retribution
for
her
own
sin
of
giving
away
her
heart
without
asking
his
approval
she
drew
no
resignation
from
the
thought
i
may
as
well
state
here
that
the
widow
did
occasionally
make
eyes
at
the
doctor
he
was
oldish
but
he
was
very
charming
and
any
man
is
better
than
no
man
she
had
given
up
carter
our
friend
colburne
was
with
his
regiment
at
thibodeaux
and
the
male
angels
of
new
orleans
were
so
few
that
their
visits
were
far
between
so
those
almond
eyes
of
dewy
blackness
and
brightness
were
frequently
turned
sidelong
upon
ravenel
with
a
coquettish
significance
which
made
lillie
uneasy
in
the
innermost
chambers
of
her
filial
affection
larue
had
very
remarkable
eyes
they
were
the
only
features
of
her
face
that
were
not
under
her
control
they
were
so
expressive
that
she
never
could
fully
veil
their
meaning
they
were
beautiful
spiders
weaving
quite
visibly
webs
of
entanglement
the
threads
of
which
were
rays
of
dazzling
light
and
subtle
sentiment
devilish
handsome
eyes
dangerous
by
jove
remarked
the
colonel
judging
in
his
usual
confident
broadcast
fashion
right
rather
more
than
half
the
time
i
seen
the
day
by
jove
when
they
would
have
finished
me
for
the
present
the
doctor
was
saved
from
their
perilous
witchery
by
the
advent
of
colburne
who
having
obtained
a
leave
of
absence
for
ten
days
came
of
course
to
spend
it
with
the
ravenels
immediately
the
larue
orbs
kindled
for
him
as
if
they
were
pyres
whereon
his
passions
if
he
chose
might
consume
themselves
to
ashes
she
exhibited
and
felt
no
animosity
on
account
of
bygones
she
was
a
most
forgiving
selfish
little
creature
she
never
had
standing
quarrels
least
of
all
with
the
other
sex
and
she
could
practice
a
marvellous
perseverance
without
any
acrimony
in
case
of
disappointment
colburne
was
favored
with
private
interviews
which
he
did
not
seek
and
visions
of
conquest
which
did
not
excite
his
ambition
he
was
taken
by
gentle
force
up
the
intricate
paths
of
a
mountain
of
talk
and
shown
the
unsubstantial
and
turbulent
kingdoms
of
coquetry
with
a
hint
that
all
might
be
his
if
he
would
but
fall
down
and
worship
it
became
a
question
in
his
mind
whether
milton
should
not
have
represented
satan
as
a
female
of
french
extraction
and
new
orleans
education
captain
colburne
you
do
not
like
women
she
once
said
i
beg
your
pardon
i
repel
the
horrible
accusation
oh
i
admit
that
you
like
a
woman
this
one
perhaps
or
that
one
but
it
is
the
individual
which
interests
you
and
not
the
sex
for
woman
as
woman
for
woman
because
she
is
woman
you
care
little
larue
it
is
a
very
singular
charge
now
that
you
have
brought
it
to
my
notice
i
do
know
but
i
must
plead
guilty
to
some
extent
you
mean
to
say
i
suppose
that
i
ca
or
wo
fall
in
love
with
the
first
woman
i
come
to
merely
because
she
is
handy
that
is
precisely
it
only
you
have
phrased
it
rather
grossly
and
do
you
charge
it
as
a
fault
in
my
character
i
avow
that
i
do
not
regard
it
as
so
manly
so
truly
masculine
you
comprehend
as
the
opposite
trait
upon
my
honor
exclaimed
colburne
in
amazement
then
you
must
consider
i
beg
your
pardon
but
it
follows
that
don
juan
was
a
model
man
in
my
opinion
he
was
excuse
my
frankness
i
am
older
than
you
i
have
seen
much
life
i
have
a
right
to
philosophise
just
see
here
it
is
intended
for
wise
reasons
that
man
should
not
leave
woman
alone
that
he
should
seek
after
her
constantly
and
force
himself
upon
her
that
losing
one
he
should
find
another
therefore
the
man
who
losing
one
chooses
another
best
represents
his
sex
she
waited
for
a
reply
to
her
argument
but
colburne
was
too
much
crushed
to
offer
one
he
shirked
his
honest
duty
as
an
interlocutor
by
saying
larue
this
is
a
novel
idea
to
me
and
i
must
have
time
for
consideration
before
i
accept
it
she
laughed
without
a
sign
of
embarrassment
and
changed
the
subject
but
larue
was
not
the
only
cause
which
prevented
colburne
visit
from
being
a
monotony
of
happiness
he
soon
discovered
that
there
was
an
understanding
between
colonel
carter
and
miss
ravenel
not
an
engagement
perhaps
but
certainly
an
inner
circle
of
confidences
and
sentiments
into
which
he
was
not
allowed
to
enter
in
this
matter
lillie
was
more
open
and
legible
than
her
lover
she
so
adored
her
hero
because
of
the
deadly
perils
which
he
had
affronted
and
the
honor
which
he
had
borne
from
among
their
flame
and
smoke
that
she
could
not
always
conceal
and
sometimes
did
not
care
to
conceal
her
admiration
not
that
she
ever
expressed
it
by
endearments
or
fondling
words
no
that
would
have
been
a
coarse
audacity
of
which
her
maidenly
nature
was
incapable
but
there
were
rare
glances
of
irrepressible
meaning
surprised
out
of
her
very
soul
which
came
like
revelations
when
she
asked
colburne
to
tell
her
the
whole
story
of
georgia
landing
he
guessed
easily
what
she
most
wanted
to
hear
to
please
her
he
made
carter
the
hero
of
the
epic
related
how
impetuous
he
was
during
the
charge
how
superbly
cool
as
soon
as
it
was
over
how
he
sat
his
horse
and
waved
his
sabre
and
gave
his
orders
to
be
sure
the
enthusiastic
youth
took
a
soldierly
pleasure
in
the
history
he
was
honestly
proud
of
his
commander
and
he
loved
to
tell
the
tale
of
his
own
only
battle
but
notwithstanding
this
slight
pleasure
notwithstanding
that
the
doctor
treated
him
with
even
tender
consideration
and
that
larue
was
often
amusing
as
well
as
embarrassing
he
did
not
enjoy
his
visit
this
mysterious
cloud
which
encompassed
the
colonel
and
miss
ravenel
separating
them
from
all
others
cast
upon
him
a
shadow
of
melancholy
in
the
first
place
of
course
it
was
painful
to
suspect
that
he
had
lost
this
charming
girl
in
the
second
he
grieved
on
her
account
not
believing
it
possible
that
with
that
man
for
a
husband
she
could
be
permanently
happy
carter
was
a
brave
soldier
an
able
officer
a
person
of
warm
and
naturally
kind
impulses
but
gentlemen
of
such
habits
as
his
were
not
considered
good
matches
where
colburne
had
formed
his
opinions
no
man
whatever
his
talents
could
win
a
professorship
in
winslow
university
or
occupy
a
respectable
niche
in
new
boston
society
who
rarely
went
to
church
who
drank
freely
and
openly
who
had
been
seen
to
gamble
who
swore
like
a
trooper
and
who
did
other
things
which
the
colonel
had
been
known
to
do
all
this
time
he
was
so
by
nature
and
so
oppressed
by
an
acquired
sense
of
soldierly
subordination
that
he
never
seriously
thought
of
setting
himself
up
as
a
rival
against
the
colonel
perhaps
i
am
tedious
in
my
analysis
of
the
captain
opinions
motives
and
sentiments
the
truth
is
that
i
take
a
sympathetic
interest
in
him
believing
him
to
be
a
representative
young
man
of
my
native
new
england
and
that
i
consider
him
a
better
match
for
miss
ravenel
than
this
southern
gentleman
whom
she
insists
upon
having
while
colburne
was
feeling
so
strongly
with
regard
to
lillie
could
she
not
devote
a
sentiment
to
him
not
many
she
had
not
time
she
was
otherwise
occupied
so
selfishly
wrapped
up
in
her
own
affections
was
she
that
until
larue
laughingly
suggested
it
she
never
thought
of
his
being
jealous
or
miserable
on
account
of
her
then
she
hoped
that
he
did
not
care
much
for
her
and
was
really
sorry
for
him
if
he
did
what
a
horrible
fate
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
disappointed
in
love
she
remembered
that
she
had
once
liked
him
very
much
indeed
but
so
she
did
even
yet
she
added
with
a
comfortable
closing
of
her
eyes
to
all
change
in
the
nature
of
the
sentiment
and
perhaps
he
only
fancied
her
in
a
similar
platonic
fashion
once
she
had
cut
out
of
a
paper
and
put
away
in
so
safe
a
place
that
now
she
could
not
find
it
a
little
poem
which
he
had
written
and
which
was
only
interesting
because
he
was
the
author
she
blushed
as
she
called
her
folly
to
mind
and
resolved
that
it
should
never
be
known
to
any
one
it
is
curious
that
she
was
a
little
vexed
with
colburne
because
of
this
reminiscence
and
felt
that
it
more
than
repaid
him
for
all
the
secret
devotion
which
he
might
have
lavished
on
her
my
leave
of
absence
has
not
been
as
pleasant
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
he
once
had
the
courage
to
remark
why
not
she
asked
for
she
was
thinking
of
her
own
heart
affairs
i
fear
that
i
have
lost
some
sympathies
which
i
once
here
he
checked
himself
not
daring
to
confess
how
much
he
had
once
hoped
with
a
sudden
comprehension
of
his
meaning
lillie
colored
intensely
after
her
usual
fashion
on
startling
occasions
and
glanced
about
the
room
in
search
of
some
other
subject
of
conversation
i
have
a
sense
of
being
a
stranger
in
the
family
he
explained
after
a
moment
of
painful
silence
she
might
surely
have
said
something
kind
here
but
she
was
too
conscientious
or
too
much
embarrassed
to
do
it
she
made
one
of
those
efforts
which
women
are
capable
of
and
sailed
out
of
the
difficulty
on
the
wings
of
a
laugh
i
am
sure
larue
takes
a
deep
interest
in
you
colburne
colored
in
his
turn
under
a
sense
of
mortification
mingled
with
something
like
anger
both
were
relieved
when
doctor
ravenel
entered
and
thereby
broke
up
the
fretting
dialogue
now
why
was
not
the
young
man
informed
of
the
real
state
of
affairs
in
the
family
simply
because
the
doctor
fearful
for
his
child
happiness
and
loth
to
lose
dominion
over
her
future
could
not
yet
bring
himself
to
consider
the
engagement
as
a
finality
there
were
no
scenes
during
the
leave
of
absence
neither
colburne
nor
madame
larue
made
a
declaration
or
received
a
refusal
two
days
before
the
leave
of
absence
terminated
he
sadly
and
wisely
and
resolutely
took
his
departure
for
thibodeaux
nothing
of
interest
happened
to
him
during
the
winter
except
that
he
accompanied
his
regiment
in
weitzel
advance
up
the
teche
which
resulted
in
the
retreat
of
mouton
from
camp
beasland
and
the
destruction
of
the
rebel
cotton
a
narrative
of
the
expedition
written
with
his
usual
martial
enthusiasm
but
which
unfortunately
i
have
not
space
to
publish
was
received
by
doctor
ravenel
and
declared
by
him
to
be
equal
in
precision
brevity
elegance
and
every
other
classical
quality
of
style
to
the
commentaries
of
julius
c√¶sar
the
colonel
remarked
in
his
practical
way
that
the
thing
seemed
to
have
been
well
planned
and
that
the
captain
account
was
a
good
model
for
a
despatch
only
a
little
too
and
poetical
colburne
being
absent
larue
turned
her
guns
once
more
upon
the
doctor
as
the
motto
of
an
irishman
at
a
donnybrook
fair
is
wherever
you
see
a
head
hit
it
so
the
rule
which
guided
her
in
the
vanity
fair
of
this
life
was
wherever
you
see
a
man
set
your
cap
at
him
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
she
made
the
same
eyes
at
the
doctor
that
she
made
at
colburne
her
manner
would
vary
amazingly
and
frequently
did
vary
to
suit
her
company
just
as
a
chameleon
jacket
is
said
to
change
color
according
to
the
tree
which
he
inhabits
and
this
was
not
because
she
was
simple
and
easily
influenced
but
precisely
because
she
was
artful
and
anxious
to
govern
and
knew
that
soft
looks
and
words
are
woman
best
means
of
empire
it
was
interesting
to
see
what
a
and
saintly
she
could
take
in
the
presence
of
a
clergyman
to
the
colonel
she
acted
the
part
of
lady
gay
spanker
to
the
doctor
she
was
and
so
far
as
she
could
be
to
colburne
she
of
late
generally
played
the
female
platonic
philosopher
it
really
annoys
me
to
reflect
how
little
space
i
must
allow
myself
for
painting
the
character
of
this
remarkable
woman
she
was
nobody
fool
but
her
own
remarked
the
colonel
who
understood
her
in
a
coarse
incomplete
way
nor
did
she
deceive
either
lillie
or
the
doctor
in
regard
to
the
main
features
of
her
character
although
they
had
no
suspicion
how
far
she
could
carry
some
of
her
secret
caprices
it
is
hard
to
blind
completely
the
eyes
of
one
own
family
and
daily
intimates
as
a
hen
is
in
trouble
when
her
ducklings
take
to
the
water
so
was
lillie
soul
disturbed
when
her
father
was
out
on
the
flattering
sea
of
madame
conversation
carter
was
amused
at
the
wiles
of
the
widow
and
the
terrors
of
the
daughter
he
comprehended
the
affair
as
well
as
lillie
at
the
same
time
that
he
did
not
see
so
very
much
harm
in
it
for
the
lady
was
pretty
clever
young
enough
and
had
money
but
nothing
came
of
the
flirtation
at
least
not
for
the
present
although
the
doctor
was
an
eminently
sociable
being
and
indefatigably
courteous
to
all
of
eve
daughters
he
was
not
at
bottom
what
you
call
a
man
he
was
too
much
wrapped
up
in
his
daughter
and
in
his
scientific
studies
to
be
easily
pervious
to
the
shafts
of
cupid
besides
which
he
was
pretty
solidly
cuirassed
by
years
of
worldly
experience
madame
even
felt
that
she
was
kept
at
a
distance
or
to
use
a
more
corporeal
and
specially
correct
expression
at
arm
length
by
his
very
politeness
doctor
have
you
not
thought
it
odd
sometimes
that
i
never
consult
you
professionally
she
asked
one
day
changing
suddenly
from
to
lady
gay
spanker
really
it
never
occurred
to
me
i
do
expect
to
prescribe
for
my
own
family
it
would
be
unfair
to
my
brother
doctors
i
believe
too
that
you
are
never
sick
thanks
to
heaven
never
but
that
is
not
the
only
cause
the
truth
is
perhaps
you
have
not
noticed
the
fact
but
you
are
not
married
if
you
want
me
for
a
patient
there
must
first
be
a
mrs
ravenel
ah
yes
somebody
to
whom
i
could
confide
what
is
the
matter
with
you
that
would
not
matter
we
women
always
tell
our
own
maladies
no
that
would
not
matter
it
is
merely
the
look
of
the
thing
that
troubles
me
the
doctor
had
the
air
of
being
cornered
and
remained
smiling
at
larue
awaiting
her
pleasure
i
do
not
propose
to
consult
you
she
continued
i
am
so
constantly
well
that
i
am
almost
unhappy
about
it
but
i
do
think
seriously
of
studying
medicine
what
is
your
opinion
of
female
doctors
a
capital
idea
exclaimed
ravenel
jumping
at
the
change
of
subject
why
not
follow
it
up
you
could
master
the
science
of
medicine
in
two
or
three
years
and
you
have
ability
enough
to
practice
it
to
great
advantage
you
might
be
extremely
useful
by
making
a
specialty
of
your
own
sex
you
are
a
professor
of
theory
and
practice
doctor
will
you
instruct
me
oh
as
to
that
elderkin
would
be
better
he
is
precisely
in
what
ought
to
be
your
line
i
think
that
out
of
kindness
to
you
i
ought
to
say
no
not
even
if
i
would
promise
to
study
mineralogy
also
ravenel
pondered
an
instant
and
then
eluded
her
with
a
story
that
reminds
me
of
a
chaffering
which
i
overheard
in
a
country
tavern
in
georgia
between
a
yankee
peddler
and
an
indigenous
specimen
the
cracker
wanted
to
sell
the
stranger
a
horse
do
care
particularly
for
a
trade
says
the
yankee
i
buy
the
shoes
if
you
throw
in
the
creetur
medicine
is
a
great
science
but
mineralogy
is
a
far
vaster
one
in
short
the
doctor
was
to
madame
like
a
cold
cake
to
a
lump
of
butter
he
calmly
endured
her
but
gave
her
no
encouragement
to
melt
upon
his
bosom
just
at
this
time
he
was
more
than
usually
safe
from
love
entanglements
because
he
was
so
anxious
about
lillie
position
and
prospects
he
made
what
inquiries
he
could
concerning
carter
way
of
life
and
watched
his
demeanor
and
conversation
closely
while
talking
to
him
with
the
politest
of
smiles
he
was
unexpectedly
gratified
by
discovering
that
his
proposed
led
at
least
for
the
present
a
sober
and
decent
life
with
his
devotion
as
a
lover
no
fault
could
be
found
by
the
most
exacting
of
fathers
he
called
on
lillie
every
evening
and
sent
her
flowers
every
morning
in
short
he
bloomed
with
fair
promise
of
being
an
affectionate
and
even
uxorious
husband
gradually
the
doctor
weaned
himself
from
his
selfish
or
loving
suspicions
and
became
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
from
this
man
his
daughter
might
draw
a
happiness
thus
when
it
happened
late
in
january
nearly
four
months
after
the
declaration
that
carter
requested
to
be
informed
definitely
as
to
his
prospects
he
obtained
permission
to
consider
the
affair
an
engagement
you
know
i
ca
promise
wealth
to
miss
ravenel
he
said
frankly
she
may
have
to
put
up
with
a
very
simple
style
of
life
if
she
ca
be
contented
i
shall
not
pity
her
answered
the
doctor
i
do
believe
that
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
but
i
do
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
degrading
passions
conceivable
in
woman
i
sympathise
with
no
woman
whose
only
trouble
is
that
she
can
not
have
and
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
by
the
way
you
know
how
unable
i
am
to
endow
her
do
mention
it
you
have
already
endowed
her
the
character
that
you
have
transmitted
to
her
sir
the
doctor
bowed
so
promptly
and
appreciatively
that
the
colonel
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
round
off
the
compliment
as
men
do
not
talk
copiously
with
each
other
on
these
subjects
the
interview
did
not
last
ten
minutes
i
hope
that
i
shall
not
impress
the
reader
unfavorably
concerning
lillie
character
when
i
state
that
she
was
frankly
happy
over
the
result
of
her
lover
probation
her
delight
did
not
arise
merely
from
the
prospect
of
a
smooth
course
of
love
and
marriage
it
sprang
in
part
from
the
greatly
comforting
fact
that
now
there
was
no
difference
of
opinion
no
bar
to
perfect
sympathy
between
her
and
that
loved
respected
almost
adored
papa
i
have
given
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
her
if
i
have
not
already
made
it
clear
that
with
her
the
sentiment
of
filial
affection
was
almost
a
passion
from
very
early
childhood
she
had
been
remarkable
for
or
whatever
may
be
the
learned
name
for
the
canonization
of
one
progenitors
at
the
age
of
seven
she
had
propounded
the
question
mamma
why
do
they
make
papa
president
of
the
united
states
some
light
may
be
shed
on
the
character
of
this
departed
mother
and
wife
by
stating
that
her
answer
was
my
dear
your
father
never
chose
to
meddle
in
politics
whether
ravenel
actually
deified
the
doctor
with
all
the
simple
faith
of
the
child
or
whether
the
reply
was
merely
meant
to
confirm
the
latter
in
her
filial
piety
is
a
matter
of
doubt
even
to
persons
who
were
well
acquainted
with
the
deceased
lady
at
last
lillie
could
prattle
to
her
father
about
carter
as
much
as
she
liked
and
she
used
the
privilege
freely
being
habituated
to
need
demand
and
obtain
his
sympathies
not
that
she
filled
his
ears
with
confessions
of
love
or
said
that
colonel
carter
was
handsome
or
anything
of
that
sickish
nature
but
when
her
father
came
in
from
a
walk
it
was
papa
did
you
see
carter
anywhere
and
what
did
he
say
at
another
time
it
was
papa
did
carter
ever
tell
you
about
his
first
campaign
against
the
indians
and
then
would
follow
the
story
related
with
glee
and
a
humorous
appreciation
of
the
grandiloquent
ideas
of
a
juvenile
west
pointer
about
to
draw
his
maiden
sword
a
frequent
subject
of
her
conversation
was
carter
chance
of
promotion
not
considered
with
regard
to
the
pecuniary
advantages
thereof
but
in
respect
to
the
simple
justice
of
advancing
such
an
able
and
gallant
officer
it
was
papa
how
can
the
government
be
so
stupid
as
to
neglect
men
who
know
their
duties
larue
says
that
the
abolitionists
are
opposed
to
carter
because
he
does
hold
their
ultra
opinions
i
suppose
they
would
rather
favor
a
man
who
talks
as
they
do
even
if
he
got
whipped
every
time
and
never
freed
a
nigger
if
carter
were
on
the
southern
side
he
would
find
promotion
fast
enough
it
is
enough
to
make
any
one
turn
rebel
my
dear
says
the
doctor
with
emphasis
i
would
rather
be
a
private
soldier
under
the
flag
of
my
country
than
be
a
in
the
army
of
those
villainous
conspirators
against
country
liberty
and
humanity
i
respect
colonel
carter
for
holding
fast
to
his
patriotic
sentiments
in
spite
of
unjust
neglect
far
more
than
i
would
if
he
were
loyal
merely
because
he
was
sure
of
being
lillie
could
not
fail
to
be
gratified
by
such
a
compliment
to
the
moral
worth
of
her
hero
after
a
few
moments
of
agreeable
meditation
on
the
various
perfections
of
that
great
being
she
resumed
the
old
subject
i
think
that
there
is
a
chance
yet
of
his
getting
a
star
when
the
official
report
of
the
battle
of
georgia
landing
once
reaches
the
minds
of
those
slow
creatures
at
washington
what
do
you
think
papa
what
are
the
probabilities
really
my
dear
you
perplex
me
prophecy
never
formed
a
part
of
my
education
there
are
even
a
few
events
in
the
past
that
i
am
not
intimately
acquainted
with
then
you
should
look
so
awfully
old
papa
if
you
wrinkle
up
your
forehead
in
that
venerable
way
as
if
you
were
the
wandering
jew
you
must
expect
to
have
people
ask
you
all
sorts
of
questions
why
will
you
do
it
i
hate
to
see
you
making
yourself
so
aggravatingly
ancient
when
nature
does
her
best
to
keep
you
young
about
these
times
the
doctor
wrote
with
a
pitying
if
not
a
sad
heart
to
inform
colburne
of
the
engagement
the
young
man
had
looked
for
some
such
news
but
it
nevertheless
pained
him
beyond
his
anticipations
no
mental
preparation
no
melancholy
certainty
of
forecast
ever
quite
fits
us
to
meet
the
avalanche
of
a
great
calamity
no
matter
for
instance
how
long
we
have
watched
the
sure
invasion
of
disease
upon
the
life
of
a
dear
friend
or
relative
we
are
always
astonished
with
a
mighty
shock
when
the
last
feeble
breath
leaves
the
wasted
body
colburne
had
long
sat
gloomily
by
the
bedside
of
his
dying
hope
but
when
it
expired
outright
he
was
seemingly
none
the
less
full
of
anguished
amazement
who
would
have
thought
it
he
repeated
to
himself
how
could
she
choose
such
a
husband
so
old
so
worldly
so
immoral
god
help
her
and
watch
over
her
the
love
of
such
a
man
is
a
calamity
the
tender
mercies
of
the
wicked
are
unintentional
cruelties
as
for
himself
the
present
seemed
a
barren
waste
without
a
blossom
of
happiness
and
the
future
another
waste
without
an
oasis
of
hope
for
a
time
he
even
lost
all
desire
for
promotion
or
for
any
other
worldly
honor
or
success
and
he
would
not
have
considered
it
hard
so
undesirable
did
life
appear
if
he
had
known
that
it
was
his
fate
to
die
in
the
next
battle
if
he
wanted
to
live
it
was
only
to
see
the
war
terminate
gloriously
and
the
stars
and
stripes
once
more
flying
over
his
whole
country
the
devotional
sentiments
which
his
mother
had
sown
throughout
his
youth
and
which
had
been
warmed
for
a
while
into
some
strength
of
feeling
and
purpose
by
the
saintly
glory
of
her
death
struggled
anew
into
temporary
bloom
under
the
clouds
of
this
second
bereavement
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
he
thought
and
then
how
unworthy
i
am
to
repeat
those
words
there
were
certain
verses
of
the
bible
which
whispered
to
him
a
comforting
sympathy
many
times
a
day
such
a
phrase
as
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
repeated
to
him
as
if
by
some
other
self
or
guardian
angel
would
thrill
his
mind
with
the
plaintive
consolation
of
requiems
chapter
xvii
colonel
carter
is
entirely
victorious
before
he
begins
his
campaign
towards
the
close
of
this
winter
of
banks
superseded
butler
and
the
new
england
division
expanded
into
the
nineteenth
army
corps
every
one
who
was
in
new
orleans
during
that
season
will
remember
the
amazement
with
which
he
and
all
other
persons
saw
transport
after
transport
steam
up
the
river
increasing
the
loyal
forces
in
and
around
the
city
by
at
least
ten
thousand
men
which
rumor
magnified
into
thousand
where
did
they
come
from
and
where
were
they
going
and
what
would
be
the
result
since
the
opening
of
the
war
no
expedition
of
magnitude
had
been
conducted
with
similar
secrecy
and
every
one
argued
that
a
general
who
could
plan
with
such
reticence
would
execute
with
corresponding
vigor
and
ability
while
the
secessionists
shrank
within
themselves
seeing
no
more
hope
of
freeing
louisiana
from
northern
vandals
our
doctor
and
his
fellow
loyalists
exulted
in
a
belief
that
the
war
would
soon
be
brought
to
a
triumphant
close
three
mere
transports
exclaimed
ravenel
coming
in
from
a
walk
on
the
levee
it
is
a
most
glorious
spectacle
this
exhibition
of
the
power
of
the
republic
it
equals
the
greatest
military
efforts
of
the
greatest
military
nations
one
is
absolutely
reminded
of
consular
rome
carrying
on
the
war
with
hannibal
in
italy
and
at
the
same
time
sending
one
great
army
to
spain
and
another
to
africa
i
pin
my
faith
to
the
tail
of
general
scott
anaconda
in
the
end
it
will
crush
secessia
break
every
bone
in
its
body
and
swallow
it
i
think
colonel
that
we
have
every
reason
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
the
prospects
i
really
ca
see
it
answered
carter
with
a
lugubrious
laugh
how
so
you
astonish
me
do
you
perceive
that
i
lose
my
governorship
oh
but
i
do
anticipate
an
immediate
close
of
the
struggle
it
may
last
a
year
yet
and
during
that
time
that
is
not
the
point
king
stork
has
succeeded
king
log
king
men
must
have
the
nice
places
and
king
log
men
must
get
out
of
them
oh
but
they
wo
turn
you
out
exclaimed
lillie
and
then
blushed
as
she
thought
how
her
eagerness
might
be
interpreted
we
shall
see
answered
the
colonel
gravely
and
almost
sadly
he
was
so
much
in
love
with
this
girl
that
a
life
in
capua
with
her
seemed
more
desirable
than
the
winning
of
cann√¶
away
from
her
here
is
my
fate
he
said
when
he
called
on
the
following
evening
and
handed
her
two
official
documents
the
one
relieving
him
from
his
position
as
military
governor
the
other
assigning
him
to
the
command
of
a
brigade
now
you
must
go
into
the
battle
again
she
said
making
a
struggle
to
preserve
her
i
am
sorry
on
your
account
at
this
answer
her
effort
at
stoicism
and
maidenly
dignity
failed
she
dropped
her
head
and
hid
her
face
in
the
sewing
work
on
which
she
had
been
engaged
this
was
too
much
for
carter
to
whom
love
had
been
a
rejuvenation
and
almost
a
regeneration
so
that
he
was
as
gentle
virginal
and
sensitive
as
if
he
had
never
known
the
hardening
experiences
of
a
soldier
and
a
man
about
town
sitting
down
beside
his
betrothed
he
pressed
her
temples
with
both
his
hands
and
kissed
the
light
flossy
ripples
of
her
hair
he
could
feel
the
sobs
which
trembled
through
her
frame
breaking
softly
and
noiselessly
like
summer
waves
dying
on
a
reedy
shore
how
he
longed
to
soothe
her
by
grasping
all
her
being
into
his
and
making
her
altogether
his
own
he
was
on
the
point
of
falling
before
the
temptation
which
he
had
that
morning
resolved
to
resist
he
knew
that
he
ought
not
to
marry
with
only
his
colonelcy
as
a
support
yet
he
was
about
to
urge
an
immediate
marriage
and
would
have
done
so
had
he
spoken
lillie
would
not
have
refused
him
it
would
not
have
been
in
the
nature
of
woman
what
girl
would
put
off
a
lover
who
was
going
to
the
nothing
prevented
the
consummation
of
this
imprudence
but
a
ring
at
the
miss
ravenel
sprang
up
and
fled
from
the
parlor
fearful
of
being
caught
with
tears
on
her
cheeks
and
her
hair
disordered
larue
entered
gave
the
colonel
a
saucy
courtesy
cast
a
keen
sidelong
glance
at
his
serious
countenance
repressed
apparently
some
flippant
remark
which
was
on
her
lips
begged
him
to
excuse
her
for
a
few
moments
and
slid
out
of
the
room
confound
her
muttered
the
colonel
indignant
at
madame
without
cause
merely
because
he
had
been
interrupted
by
the
time
that
lillie
had
dried
her
eyes
washed
her
face
and
composed
herself
so
far
as
to
dare
return
to
the
parlor
larue
ignorant
of
the
good
or
mischief
that
she
was
accomplishing
was
there
also
consequently
although
carter
stayed
late
into
the
evening
there
was
no
second
opportunity
for
the
perilous
trial
of
a
farewell
next
day
he
went
by
the
first
train
to
thibodeaux
as
commanding
officer
of
a
brigade
he
exhibited
his
usual
energy
practical
ability
and
beneficent
despotism
the
colonels
were
ordered
to
make
immediate
inspections
of
their
regiments
and
to
send
in
reports
of
articles
necessary
to
complete
the
equipment
of
their
men
with
requisitions
for
the
same
on
the
brigade
quartermaster
during
several
consecutive
days
he
personally
went
the
rounds
of
his
grand
guards
and
outlying
videttes
choosing
for
this
purpose
midnight
or
a
wet
storm
or
any
other
time
when
he
suspected
that
men
or
officers
might
relax
their
vigilance
in
such
a
pelting
rain
as
if
the
father
of
waters
had
been
taken
up
to
heaven
and
poured
back
into
louisiana
he
came
upon
a
picket
of
five
men
who
had
sought
refuge
in
some
empty
the
heads
were
toward
the
road
because
from
that
direction
came
the
wind
and
such
was
the
pattering
and
howling
of
the
tempest
that
the
men
did
not
hear
the
tramp
of
the
approaching
horse
reining
up
the
colonel
shouted
surrender
the
first
man
that
stirs
dies
not
a
soul
moved
or
answered
for
a
minute
or
two
carter
sat
motionless
smiling
grimly
with
the
water
streaming
down
his
face
and
uniform
then
he
ordered
come
out
here
one
of
you
i
want
to
see
what
this
picket
is
made
of
a
corporal
crawled
out
leaving
his
gun
behind
him
in
the
recumbent
hogshead
his
face
was
pale
at
his
first
appearance
but
it
turned
paler
still
when
he
recognized
his
brigade
commander
i
i
thought
it
was
a
secesh
he
stammered
and
so
you
surrendered
sir
thundered
the
colonel
you
allowed
yourself
to
be
surprised
and
then
you
surrendered
give
me
your
name
sir
and
the
names
of
your
men
twenty
minutes
afterward
a
detachment
from
the
reserve
relieved
the
culprits
and
marched
them
into
camp
as
prisoners
next
day
the
corporal
and
the
soldier
whose
turn
it
had
been
to
stand
as
sentry
went
before
a
and
in
a
week
thereafter
were
on
their
way
to
ship
island
to
work
out
a
sentence
of
hard
labor
with
ball
and
chain
on
the
midnight
following
this
adventure
carter
ordered
the
outlying
videttes
to
fire
three
rounds
of
musketry
and
then
rode
from
camp
to
camp
to
see
which
regiment
got
into
line
the
quickest
the
members
of
his
staff
especially
his
and
aid
found
their
positions
no
sinecures
every
night
one
or
other
of
these
young
gentlemen
made
the
rounds
of
the
pickets
some
time
between
midnight
and
daybreak
and
immediately
on
his
return
to
reported
to
the
colonel
the
condition
of
the
line
as
regarded
practical
efficiency
and
knowledge
of
the
formalities
if
the
troops
fell
in
at
three
in
the
morning
to
go
through
the
drill
of
taking
position
to
repel
an
imaginary
enemy
they
had
at
least
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
some
poor
had
been
roused
out
of
bed
half
an
hour
before
to
disseminate
the
order
a
inspected
every
and
every
and
made
a
report
as
to
how
the
same
was
conducted
a
rode
through
every
regimental
camp
every
morning
and
made
a
report
of
its
condition
as
to
cleanliness
if
the
explosion
of
a
rifle
was
heard
any
where
about
the
post
a
was
on
the
spot
in
five
minutes
to
learn
the
circumstances
of
the
irregularity
to
order
the
offender
to
the
and
to
make
his
report
to
the
brigade
commander
a
false
or
incomplete
statement
he
did
not
dare
to
render
so
severe
was
the
which
he
was
liable
to
undergo
did
you
see
it
yourself
lieutenant
the
colonel
would
ask
i
saw
the
man
cleaning
his
piece
sir
and
he
confessed
that
he
had
discharged
it
to
get
the
ball
out
who
was
the
man
private
henry
brown
company
i
ninth
barataria
very
well
mr
brayton
in
the
regular
army
a
lieutenant
is
now
have
the
kindness
to
take
my
compliments
to
the
colonel
of
the
ninth
barataria
and
the
of
the
day
and
request
them
to
step
here
first
comes
the
commanding
officer
of
the
regiment
in
which
the
offence
has
been
committed
walk
in
colonel
says
the
brigade
commander
take
a
seat
sir
colonel
a
rifle
has
been
fired
by
one
of
your
men
this
morning
how
is
that
it
was
against
my
orders
sir
the
man
is
in
the
this
is
not
the
first
offence
of
the
kind
it
is
the
third
or
fourth
within
a
week
the
fact
is
sir
that
the
men
have
no
their
rifles
get
wet
on
picket
duty
and
they
have
no
means
of
drawing
the
loads
consequently
they
are
tempted
to
discharge
them
notwithstanding
the
orders
ah
you
must
give
them
the
devil
until
they
learn
to
resist
temptation
but
no
how
is
that
i
was
not
aware
sir
of
the
deficiency
not
aware
of
it
my
god
colonel
not
aware
of
such
a
deficiency
of
equipment
in
your
own
regiment
i
am
extremely
sorry
sir
apologizes
the
humiliated
colonel
who
does
not
know
what
might
be
done
to
him
for
such
neglect
and
who
although
only
three
months
in
the
service
is
a
conscientious
officer
anxious
to
do
his
whole
duty
send
up
a
requisition
for
and
for
every
other
lacking
article
of
ordnance
says
the
brigade
commander
i
will
forward
it
to
and
see
that
you
are
supplied
but
by
the
way
how
did
this
fellow
get
outside
your
with
his
gun
that
is
all
wrong
have
the
goodness
to
haul
your
officer
of
the
guard
over
the
coals
about
it
make
him
understand
that
he
is
responsible
for
such
irregularities
and
that
he
may
get
dismissed
the
service
if
he
does
attend
to
his
duties
that
is
all
colonel
will
you
take
a
glass
of
brandy
morning
sir
then
turning
to
the
captain
make
out
a
circular
directing
commandants
of
regiments
to
see
that
targets
are
set
up
in
proper
places
where
the
relieved
guards
may
discharge
their
rifles
the
best
marksman
to
be
reported
to
regimental
and
to
be
relieved
from
all
ordinary
duty
for
hours
the
of
the
day
is
now
announced
by
the
orderly
come
in
captain
take
a
seat
sir
are
you
aware
captain
that
a
rifle
has
been
fired
this
morning
outside
the
camps
in
violation
of
general
orders
i
i
think
i
heard
it
stammers
the
captain
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
is
guilty
of
something
but
not
knowing
what
do
you
know
who
the
offender
is
demands
the
colonel
his
brow
beginning
to
blacken
like
a
stormy
heaven
over
the
ignoramus
i
do
not
sir
i
will
inquire
if
you
wish
colonel
if
i
wish
my
god
sir
of
course
i
wish
it
have
you
already
inquired
my
god
sir
what
do
you
suppose
your
duties
are
i
did
know
that
this
was
one
of
them
pleads
the
now
miserable
captain
do
you
know
sir
that
you
are
responsible
for
every
irregularity
that
happens
within
the
grand
guards
and
outside
the
camps
while
you
are
of
the
day
do
you
know
that
you
are
responsible
for
the
firing
of
this
rifle
responsible
feebly
echoes
the
captain
not
seeing
the
fact
as
yet
but
nevertheless
very
much
troubled
yes
sir
it
is
your
business
if
any
thing
goes
wrong
to
know
it
and
discover
the
perpetrators
and
report
them
for
punishment
it
was
your
business
as
soon
as
that
gun
was
fired
to
find
out
who
fired
it
to
have
him
put
under
guard
and
to
see
that
he
was
reported
for
punishment
you
have
attended
to
your
duty
sir
and
because
the
officers
of
the
day
do
know
and
do
do
their
duty
i
have
to
make
my
ride
day
and
night
and
knock
up
their
horses
here
is
my
aid
who
has
been
doing
your
business
brayton
give
the
captain
this
man
name
do
you
know
captain
muskets
should
not
be
fired
about
the
camps
at
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
enlisted
men
i
suppose
sir
to
prevent
a
waste
of
ammunition
good
god
why
yes
sir
but
that
is
all
that
is
half
sir
the
great
reason
the
reason
is
that
firing
is
a
signal
of
danger
of
an
enemy
of
battle
if
the
men
are
to
go
shooting
about
the
woods
in
this
fashion
we
shall
never
know
when
we
are
and
when
we
are
not
to
be
attacked
without
orders
from
these
headquarters
no
firing
is
permissible
except
by
the
pickets
and
that
only
when
they
are
attacked
this
matter
involves
the
safety
of
the
command
and
must
be
subjected
to
the
strictest
discipline
that
is
all
captain
morning
sir
as
the
poor
officer
of
the
day
goes
out
the
heavens
seem
to
be
peopled
with
threatening
brigade
commanders
and
the
earth
to
be
a
wilderness
of
unexplored
and
thorny
responsibilities
well
brayton
what
was
the
cause
of
the
firing
inquired
carter
one
midnight
when
the
aid
returned
from
an
expedition
of
inquiry
a
sentinel
of
the
ninth
shot
a
man
dead
sir
for
neglecting
to
halt
when
challenged
good
by
this
and
that
exclaimed
the
colonel
those
fellows
are
redeeming
themselves
it
used
to
be
the
meanest
regiment
for
guard
duty
in
the
brigade
but
this
is
the
second
man
the
ninth
fellows
have
shot
within
a
week
by
that
and
the
other
they
are
learning
their
business
what
is
the
sentinel
name
mr
brayton
private
henry
brown
company
i
the
same
man
sir
that
was
punished
the
other
day
for
firing
off
his
rifle
without
orders
ah
by
jove
he
has
learned
something
learned
to
do
as
he
is
told
brayton
i
wish
you
would
go
to
the
colonel
of
the
ninth
in
the
morning
and
request
him
from
me
to
make
brown
a
corporal
at
the
first
opportunity
ask
him
also
to
give
the
man
a
good
word
in
an
order
to
be
read
before
the
regiment
at
dress
parade
by
the
way
who
was
the
fellow
who
was
shot
private
murphy
of
the
ninth
who
had
been
to
thibodeaux
and
his
pass
he
was
probably
drunk
sir
he
had
a
bottle
of
whiskey
in
his
pocket
bully
for
him
he
died
happy
laughed
the
colonel
you
can
go
to
bed
now
brayton
much
obliged
to
you
a
few
days
later
the
brigade
commander
looked
over
the
proceedings
of
the
which
he
had
convened
and
threw
down
the
manuscript
with
an
oath
what
a
stupid
what
a
cursedly
stupid
record
orderly
give
my
compliments
to
major
jackson
and
request
him
here
he
rises
to
a
roar
to
report
here
immediately
picking
up
the
manuscript
he
annotated
it
in
pencil
until
major
jackson
was
announced
my
god
sir
he
then
broke
out
is
that
your
style
of
conducting
a
this
record
is
a
disgrace
to
you
as
president
and
to
me
for
selecting
you
for
such
duty
look
here
sir
here
is
a
private
convicted
of
beating
the
officer
of
the
guard
one
of
the
greatest
offences
sir
which
a
soldier
could
commit
an
offence
which
strikes
at
the
very
root
of
discipline
now
what
is
the
punishment
that
you
have
allotted
to
him
to
be
confined
in
the
for
three
months
and
to
carry
a
log
of
wood
for
three
hours
a
day
do
you
call
that
a
suitable
punishment
he
ought
to
have
three
years
of
hard
labor
with
ball
and
chain
that
is
the
least
he
ought
to
have
you
might
have
sentenced
him
to
be
shot
why
sir
do
you
fully
realize
what
it
is
to
strike
an
officer
and
especially
an
officer
on
duty
it
is
to
defy
the
very
soul
of
discipline
without
respect
for
officers
there
is
no
army
it
is
a
mob
major
jackson
it
appears
to
me
that
you
have
no
conception
of
the
dignity
of
your
own
position
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
an
officer
that
is
all
sir
good
morning
captain
continues
the
colonel
turning
to
his
make
out
an
order
disapproving
of
all
the
proceedings
of
this
court
and
directing
that
major
jackson
shall
not
again
be
detailed
on
while
he
remains
under
my
command
carter
was
a
terror
to
his
whole
brigade
to
the
stupidest
private
to
every
lieutenant
of
the
guard
to
every
commandant
of
company
to
the
members
of
his
staff
and
even
to
his
equals
in
grade
the
colonels
he
knew
his
business
so
well
he
was
so
invariably
right
in
his
he
was
so
familiar
with
the
labyrinth
of
regulations
and
general
orders
through
which
almost
all
others
groped
with
many
stumblings
and
he
was
so
conscientiously
and
gravely
outraged
by
offences
against
discipline
that
he
was
necessarily
a
dreadful
personage
to
use
the
composite
expression
half
hibernian
and
half
hebraic
of
lieutenant
van
zandt
he
was
a
regular
west
point
bull
of
bashan
in
the
volunteer
but
while
he
was
thus
feared
he
was
also
greatly
respected
and
a
word
of
praise
from
him
was
cherished
by
officer
or
soldier
as
a
medal
of
honor
and
stranger
still
while
he
was
exercising
what
must
seem
to
the
civilian
reader
a
despotism
he
was
writing
every
other
day
letters
full
of
ardent
affection
to
a
young
lady
in
new
orleans
in
a
general
way
one
is
tempted
to
speak
jestingly
of
the
circumstance
of
a
man
falling
in
love
with
a
girl
in
her
teens
by
the
time
a
man
gets
to
be
near
forty
his
moral
physiognomy
is
supposed
to
be
so
with
bygone
amours
as
to
be
in
a
measure
ludicrous
or
at
least
devoid
of
dignity
in
its
tenderness
but
carter
emotional
nature
was
so
emphatic
and
volcanic
so
capable
of
bringing
a
drama
of
the
affections
to
a
tragic
issue
that
i
feel
no
disposition
to
laugh
over
his
affair
with
miss
ravenel
although
it
was
by
no
means
his
first
nor
perhaps
his
twentieth
considering
the
passions
as
forces
we
are
obliged
to
respect
them
in
proportion
to
their
power
rather
than
their
direction
and
in
this
case
the
direction
was
not
bad
nor
foolish
but
good
and
highly
creditable
to
carter
for
miss
ravenel
though
as
yet
barely
adolescent
was
a
finer
woman
in
brain
and
heart
than
he
had
ever
loved
before
also
he
loved
her
better
than
he
had
ever
before
loved
any
woman
he
could
not
stay
away
from
her
as
soon
as
he
had
got
his
brigade
into
such
order
as
partially
satisfied
his
stern
professional
conscience
he
obtained
a
leave
of
absence
for
seven
days
and
went
to
new
orleans
from
this
visit
resulted
one
of
the
most
important
events
that
will
be
recorded
in
the
present
history
i
shall
hurry
over
the
particulars
because
to
me
the
circumstance
is
not
an
agreeable
one
having
from
my
first
acquaintance
with
miss
ravenel
entertained
a
fondness
for
her
i
never
could
fancy
this
match
of
hers
with
such
a
dubious
person
as
colonel
carter
who
is
quite
capable
of
making
her
very
unhappy
i
always
agreed
with
her
father
in
preferring
colburne
whose
character
although
only
half
developed
in
consequence
of
youth
modesty
and
puritan
education
is
nevertheless
one
of
those
germs
which
promise
much
beauty
and
usefulness
but
miss
ravenel
more
emotional
than
reflective
was
fated
to
love
carter
rather
than
colburne
to
her
and
probably
to
most
women
there
was
something
powerfully
magnetic
in
the
ardent
nature
which
found
its
physical
expression
in
that
robust
frame
that
florid
brunette
complexion
those
mighty
mustachios
and
darkly
burning
eyes
the
consequence
of
this
visit
to
new
orleans
was
a
sudden
marriage
the
tropical
blood
in
the
colonel
veins
drove
him
to
demand
it
and
the
electric
potency
of
his
presence
forced
miss
ravenel
to
concede
it
when
he
held
both
her
hands
in
his
and
looking
with
passionate
importunity
into
her
eyes
begged
her
not
to
let
him
go
again
into
the
flame
of
battle
without
the
consolation
of
feeling
that
she
was
altogether
and
for
ever
his
she
could
only
lay
her
head
on
his
shoulder
gently
sobbing
in
speechless
acquiescence
how
many
such
marriages
took
place
during
the
war
sweet
flowers
of
affection
springing
out
of
the
mighty
carnage
how
many
fond
girls
forgot
their
womanly
preference
for
long
engagements
slow
preparations
of
much
shopping
and
coy
hesitations
and
gentle
maidenly
tyrannies
to
fling
themselves
into
the
arms
of
lovers
who
longed
to
be
husbands
before
they
went
forth
to
die
how
many
young
men
in
uniform
left
behind
them
weeping
brides
to
whom
they
were
doomed
never
to
return
brave
boys
are
all
gone
at
their
country
call
and
yet
and
yet
we
can
not
forget
that
many
brave
boys
must
fall
this
sad
little
snatch
from
the
chorus
of
a
song
lillie
often
repeated
to
herself
with
tears
in
her
eyes
when
carter
was
at
the
front
without
minding
a
bit
the
fact
that
her
brave
boy
was
years
old
the
marriage
cost
the
doctor
a
violent
pang
but
he
consented
to
it
overborne
by
the
passion
of
the
period
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
on
bridal
dresses
any
more
than
in
bridal
tours
the
ceremony
was
performed
in
church
by
a
regimental
chaplain
in
presence
of
the
father
larue
and
half
a
dozen
chance
spectators
only
two
days
before
the
colonel
leave
of
absence
expired
neither
then
nor
afterward
could
lillie
realize
this
day
and
hour
through
which
she
walked
and
spoke
as
if
in
a
state
of
somnambulism
so
stupefied
or
benumbed
was
she
by
the
strength
of
her
emotions
the
observed
no
sign
of
feeling
about
her
except
that
her
face
was
as
pale
and
apparently
as
cold
as
alabaster
she
behaved
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
she
spoke
the
ordained
words
at
the
right
moment
and
in
a
clear
voice
and
yet
all
the
while
she
was
not
sure
that
she
was
in
her
right
mind
it
was
a
frozen
delirium
of
feeling
ice
without
and
fire
within
like
a
volcano
of
the
realms
of
the
pole
once
in
the
which
conveyed
them
home
alone
with
this
man
who
was
now
her
husband
her
master
the
ice
melted
a
little
and
she
could
weep
silently
upon
his
shoulder
she
was
not
wretched
neither
could
she
distinctly
feel
that
she
was
happy
if
this
was
happiness
then
there
could
be
a
joy
which
was
no
release
from
pain
she
had
no
doubts
about
her
future
such
as
even
yet
troubled
her
father
and
set
him
pacing
by
the
together
up
and
down
his
study
this
man
by
her
side
this
strong
and
loving
husband
would
always
make
her
happy
she
did
not
doubt
his
goodness
so
much
as
she
doubted
her
own
she
trusted
him
almost
as
firmly
as
if
he
were
a
deity
yes
he
would
always
love
her
and
she
would
always
always
always
love
him
and
what
more
was
there
to
desire
all
that
day
she
was
afraid
of
him
and
yet
could
not
bear
to
be
away
from
him
a
moment
he
had
such
an
authority
over
her
his
look
and
voice
and
touch
so
tyrannized
her
emotions
that
he
was
an
object
of
something
like
terror
and
yet
the
sense
of
his
domination
was
so
sweet
that
she
could
not
wish
it
to
be
less
but
desired
with
her
whole
beating
brain
and
heart
that
it
might
evermore
increase
i
give
no
record
of
her
conversation
at
this
time
she
said
so
little
usually
a
talker
almost
a
prattler
she
was
now
silent
a
look
from
her
husband
a
thought
of
her
husband
would
choke
her
at
any
moment
he
seemed
to
have
entered
into
her
whole
being
so
that
she
was
not
fully
herself
the
words
which
she
whispered
when
alone
with
him
were
so
sacred
with
woman
profoundest
and
purest
emotions
that
they
must
not
be
written
the
words
which
she
uttered
in
the
presence
of
others
were
not
felt
by
her
and
were
not
worth
writing
after
two
days
there
was
a
parting
perhaps
she
wretchedly
thought
a
final
one
oh
how
can
i
let
you
go
she
said
i
can
not
i
can
not
bear
it
will
you
come
back
will
you
ever
come
back
will
you
be
careful
of
yourself
you
wo
get
killed
will
you
promise
me
she
was
womanish
about
it
and
not
heroic
like
her
amazonian
sisters
on
the
rebel
side
nevertheless
she
did
not
feel
the
separation
so
bitterly
as
she
would
have
done
had
they
been
married
a
few
months
or
years
instead
of
only
a
few
hours
intimate
relations
with
her
husband
had
not
yet
become
a
habit
and
consequently
a
necessity
of
her
existence
the
mere
fact
that
they
had
exchanged
the
nuptial
vows
was
to
her
a
realization
of
all
that
she
had
ever
anticipated
in
marriage
when
they
left
the
altar
and
his
ring
was
upon
her
finger
their
wedded
life
was
as
complete
as
it
ever
would
be
and
thus
in
her
ignorance
of
what
love
might
become
she
was
spared
something
of
the
anguish
of
separation
she
was
thinking
of
her
absent
husband
when
larue
addressed
her
for
the
first
time
as
carter
and
yet
in
her
dreaminess
she
did
not
at
the
moment
recognize
the
name
as
her
own
not
until
madame
laughed
and
said
lillie
i
am
talking
to
you
then
she
colored
crimson
and
throbbed
at
the
heart
as
if
her
husband
himself
had
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
very
shortly
she
began
to
demand
the
patient
encouragements
of
her
father
all
day
when
she
could
get
at
him
she
pursued
him
with
questions
which
no
man
in
these
unprophetic
days
could
answer
it
was
papa
do
you
think
there
will
be
an
active
campaign
this
summer
papa
do
you
suppose
that
carter
will
be
allowed
to
keep
his
brigade
at
thibodeaux
she
rarely
spoke
of
her
husband
except
as
carter
she
did
not
like
his
name
john
it
sounded
too
for
such
a
superb
creature
and
the
title
of
colonel
was
too
official
to
satisfy
her
affection
but
carter
seemed
to
express
her
respect
for
this
man
her
husband
her
master
who
was
so
much
older
and
as
she
thought
morally
greater
than
herself
sometimes
the
doctor
out
of
sheer
pity
and
paternal
sympathy
answered
her
questions
just
as
she
wished
them
to
be
answered
telling
her
that
he
saw
no
prospect
of
an
active
campaign
that
the
brigade
could
not
possibly
be
spared
from
the
important
post
of
thibodeaux
etc
etc
but
then
the
exactingness
of
anxious
love
made
her
want
to
know
why
he
thought
so
and
her
persevering
inquiries
generally
ended
by
forcing
him
from
all
his
hastily
constructed
works
of
consolation
in
mere
therefore
he
occasionally
urged
upon
her
the
unpleasant
but
ennobling
duties
of
patience
and
my
dear
he
would
say
we
can
not
increase
our
means
of
happiness
without
increasing
our
possibilities
of
misery
a
woman
who
marries
is
like
a
man
who
goes
into
business
the
end
may
be
greatly
increased
wealth
or
it
may
be
bankruptcy
it
is
cowardly
to
groan
over
the
fact
you
must
learn
to
accept
the
sorrows
of
your
present
life
as
well
as
the
joys
you
must
try
to
strike
a
rational
balance
between
the
two
and
be
contented
if
you
can
say
the
whole
i
am
happier
than
i
was
i
beg
you
for
your
own
sake
to
overcome
this
habit
of
looking
at
only
the
darker
chances
of
life
if
you
go
on
fretting
you
will
not
last
the
war
out
no
constitution
no

constitution
at
any
rate
can
stand
it
you
positively

chapter
xviii
doctor
ravenel
commences
the
organization
of
southern
labor
for
some
time
previous
to
the
marriage
doctor
ravenel
had
been
plotting
the
benefit
of
the
human
race
he
was
one
of
those
philanthropic
conspirators
those
humanitarian
catilines
who
for
the
last
thirty
years
have
been
and
vilified
at
the
north
tarred
and
feathered
and
murdered
at
the
south
under
the
name
of
abolitionists
it
is
true
that
until
lately
he
has
been
a
silent
one
as
you
may
infer
from
the
fact
that
he
was
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
if
the
hydra
had
preached
abolition
in
new
orleans
previous
to
the
advent
of
farragut
and
butler
he
would
have
had
every
one
of
his
skulls
fractured
within
hours
after
he
had
commenced
his
ministry
nobody
could
have
met
the
demands
of
such
a
mission
except
that
gentleman
of
miraculous
vitality
mentioned
by
ariosto
who
as
fast
as
he
was
cut
in
pieces
picked
himself
up
and
grew
together
as
good
as
new
the
doctor
was
chiefly
intent
at
present
upon
inducing
the
negroes
to
work
as
freemen
now
that
they
were
no
longer
obliged
to
work
as
slaves
he
talked
a
great
deal
about
his
plan
to
various
influential
personages
and
even
pressed
it
at
department
headquarters
in
a
lengthy
private
interview
you
are
right
sir
said
authority
with
suave
dignity
it
is
a
matter
of
great
instant
importance
it
may
become
a
military
necessity
suppose
we
should
have
a
war
with
france
i
do
say
sir
that
there
is
any
danger
of
it
we
might
be
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
union
louisiana
would
then
have
to
live
on
her
own
resources
and
feed
her
own
army
these
negroes
be
induced
to
work
they
must
be
put
at
it
immediately
they
must
have
their
hoes
in
the
soil
before
six
weeks
are
over
otherwise
we
are
in
danger
of
a
famine
i
have
arranged
a
plan
doctor
the
are
to
pick
up
every
unemployed
negro
give
him
his
choice
as
to
what
plantation
he
will
work
on
but
see
that
he
works
somewhere
there
is
to
be
a
fixed
rate
of
wages
so
much
in
clothes
and
so
much
in
rations
select
your
plantation
my
dear
sir
and
i
will
see
that
it
is
assigned
to
you
you
will
then
obtain
your
laborers
by
making
written
application
to
the
superintendent
of
negro
labor
the
doctor
was
honestly
and
intelligently
delighted
he
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
commanding
general
motives
and
wisdom
in
such
terms
that
the
latter
high
as
he
was
in
position
and
mighty
in
authority
felt
flattered
you
could
not
possibly
talk
with
ravenel
for
ten
minutes
without
thinking
better
of
yourself
than
before
for
perceiving
that
you
had
to
do
with
a
superior
man
and
that
he
treated
you
with
deference
you
instinctively
inferred
that
you
were
not
only
a
person
but
a
personage
but
the
compliments
and
air
of
respect
which
he
accorded
the
commanding
general
were
not
mere
empty
civilities
nor
courtesies
nor
expressions
of
consideration
for
place
and
authority
ravenel
enthusiasm
led
him
to
believe
that
in
finding
a
man
who
sympathised
with
him
in
his
pet
project
he
had
found
one
of
the
greatest
minds
of
the
age
at
last
he
said
to
his
daughter
when
he
reached
home
at
last
we
are
likely
to
see
wise
justice
meted
out
to
these
poor
blacks
is
the
pleasant
asked
lillie
with
an
inconsequence
which
was
somewhat
characteristic
of
her
she
was
more
interested
in
learning
how
a
great
dignitary
looked
and
behaved
than
in
hearing
what
were
his
opinions
on
the
subject
of
freemen
labor
i
do
know
that
a
major
general
is
obliged
to
be
pleasant
at
least
not
in
war
time
answered
the
doctor
a
little
annoyed
at
the
interruption
to
the
train
of
his
ideas
yes
he
is
pleasant
enough
in
fact
something
too
much
of
deportment
he
put
me
in
mind
of
one
of
my
adventures
among
the
georgia
crackers
i
had
to
put
up
for
the
night
in
one
of
those
miserable
log
shanties
where
you
can
study
astronomy
all
night
through
the
chinks
in
the
roof
and
where
the
man
and
wife
sleep
one
side
of
you
and
the
children
and
dogs
on
the
other
the
family
it
seems
had
had
a
quarrel
with
a
neighboring
family
of
superior
pretensions
which
had
not
yet
culminated
in
gouging
or
shooting
the
eldest
daughter
a
ragged
girl
of
seventeen
described
to
me
with
great
gusto
an
encounter
which
had
taken
place
between
her
mother
and
the
female
chieftain
of
the
hostile
tribe
said
she
miss
jones
she
tried
to
come
the
dignerfied
over
mar
but
thar
she
found
her
beater
my
mar
is
hell
on
dignerty
well
the
runs
rather
too
luxuriantly
to
dignity
but
his
ideas
on
the
subject
of
reorganizing
labor
are
excellent
and
have
my
earnest
respect
and
approbation
i
believe
that
under
his
administration
the
negroes
will
be
allowed
and
encouraged
to
take
their
first
certain
step
toward
civilization
they
are
to
receive
some
remuneration
not
for
the
bygone
centuries
of
forced
labor
and
oppression
but
for
what
they
will
do
hereafter
i
do
see
papa
that
they
have
been
treated
much
worse
than
they
might
expect
responds
lillie
who
although
now
a
firm
loyalist
has
by
no
means
become
an
abolitionist
perhaps
not
my
dear
perhaps
not
they
have
no
doubt
been
better
off
in
the
dahomey
of
america
than
they
would
have
been
in
the
dahomey
of
africa
and
certainly
they
could
expect
much
from
a
christianity
whose
chief
was
a
hogshead
of
sugar
the
negroes
were
not
foolish
enough
to
look
for
much
good
in
such
a
moral
atrocity
as
that
they
have
put
their
trust
in
the
enemies
of
it
in
fr√©mont
a
while
ago
and
in
lincoln
now
at
present
they
do
expect
something
they
believe
that
year
of
jubilo
am
come
and
so
it
is
before
this
year
closes
many
of
these
poor
creatures
will
receive
what
they
never
did
before
wages
for
their
labor
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
they
will
be
led
to
realize
the
idea
of
justice
justice
honesty
mercy
and
nearly
the
whole
list
of
christian
virtues
have
hitherto
been
empty
names
to
them
having
no
practical
signification
and
in
fact
utterly
unknown
to
their
minds
except
as
words
that
for
some
unexplained
purpose
had
been
inserted
in
the
bible
how
could
they
believe
in
the
things
themselves
they
never
saw
them
practiced
at
least
they
never
felt
their
influence
of
course
they
were
liars
and
hypocrites
and
thieves
all
constituted
society
lied
to
them
by
calling
them
men
and
treating
them
as
beasts
it
played
the
hypocrite
to
them
by
preaching
to
them
the
christian
virtues
and
never
itself
practising
them
it
played
the
thief
by
taking
all
the
earnings
of
their
labor
except
just
enough
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
so
that
they
might
labor
more
our
consciences
the
conscience
of
the
nation
will
not
be
cleared
when
we
have
merely
freed
the
negroes
we
must
civilize
and
christianize
them
and
we
must
begin
this
by
teaching
them
the
great
elementary
duty
of
man
in
life
that
of
working
for
his
own
subsistence
i
am
so
interested
in
the
problem
that
i
have
resolved
to
devote
myself
personally
to
its
solution
what
and
give
up
your
hospital
yes
my
dear
i
have
already
given
it
up
and
got
my
plantation
assigned
to
me
oh
papa
where
of
course
lillie
feared
that
in
her
new
home
she
might
not
be
able
to
see
her
husband
and
of
course
the
doctor
divined
this
charming
anxiety
and
hastened
to
relieve
her
from
it
it
is
at
taylorsville
my
dear
taylorsville
forms
a
part
of
colonel
carter
military
jurisdiction
and
the
fort
there
is
garrisoned
by
a
detachment
from
his
brigade
he
can
come
to
see
us
without
neglecting
his
duties
lillie
colored
and
said
nothing
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
so
unused
as
yet
to
her
husband
that
the
thought
of
being
visited
by
him
thrilled
her
nerves
and
took
temporary
possession
of
all
her
mind
but
papa
she
presently
inquired
will
this
support
you
as
well
as
the
hospital
i
do
know
child
it
is
an
experiment
it
may
be
a
failure
and
it
may
be
a
pecuniary
success
we
shall
certainly
be
obliged
to
economize
until
our
autumn
crops
are
gathered
but
i
am
willing
to
do
that
if
i
meet
with
no
other
reward
than
my
own
consciousness
that
i
enter
upon
the
task
for
the
sake
of
a
long
oppressed
race
i
believe
that
by
means
of
kindness
and
justice
i
can
give
them
such
ideas
of
industry
and
other
social
virtues
as
they
could
not
obtain
and
have
not
obtained
from
centuries
of
robbery
and
cruelty
lillie
was
lost
in
meditation
not
concerning
the
good
of
the
blacks
but
concerning
the
probable
visits
of
colonel
carter
at
taylorsville
affectionately
selfish
woman
as
she
was
she
would
not
have
given
up
the
alarming
joy
of
one
of
those
anticipated
interviews
for
the
chance
of
civilizing
a
capering
wilderness
of
negroes
taylorsville
a
flourishing
village
before
the
war
is
situated
on
the
mississippi
just
where
it
is
tapped
by
bayou
rouge
which
is
one
of
the
dozen
channels
through
which
the
father
of
waters
finds
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
is
on
the
western
bank
of
the
river
and
for
the
most
part
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
bayou
and
is
protected
from
both
by
that
continuous
system
of
levees
which
alone
saves
southern
louisiana
from
yearly
inundations
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
a
large
portion
of
the
town
consisted
of
charred
and
ruins
its
citizens
had
been
mad
enough
to
fire
on
our
fleet
and
farragut
had
swept
it
with
his
iron
besoms
of
destruction
on
the
same
bank
of
the
mississippi
but
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
bayou
at
the
apex
of
the
angle
formed
by
the
diverging
currents
is
fort
winthrop
a
small
faced
in
part
with
bricks
surrounded
by
a
ditch
except
on
the
river
side
and
provided
with
neither
casemate
nor
bombproof
ordered
by
butler
and
designed
by
weitzel
it
had
been
thrown
up
shortly
after
the
little
victory
of
georgia
landing
it
was
to
be
within
reach
of
this
fort
in
case
of
an
attack
from
raiding
rebels
that
ravenel
had
selected
a
plantation
for
his
philanthropic
experiment
in
the
neighborhood
of
taylorsville
haste
was
necessary
to
success
for
the
planting
season
was
slipping
away
within
a
week
or
so
after
the
marriage
he
had
bought
a
stock
of
tools
and
provisions
obtained
a
ragged
corps
of
negroes
from
the
superintendent
of
colored
labor
shipped
every
thing
on
board
a
government
transport
and
was
on
the
spot
where
he
proposed
to
initiate
the
of
southern
industry
the
plantation
house
was
a
large
plain
wooden
mansion
very
much
like
those
which
the
country
gentility
of
new
england
built
about
the
beginning
of
this
century
except
that
the
necessities
of
a
southern
climate
had
dictated
a
spacious
veranda
covering
the
whole
front
two
stories
in
height
and
supported
by
tall
square
wooden
pillars
in
the
rear
was
a
wing
containing
the
kitchen
and
rooms
for
servants
farther
back
at
the
extremity
of
a
deep
and
slovenly
yard
where
pigs
had
been
wont
to
wander
without
much
opposition
was
a
hollow
square
of
cabins
for
the
each
consisting
of
two
rooms
and
all
alike
built
of
rough
boards
coarsely
whitewashed
neither
the
cabins
nor
the
family
mansion
had
a
cellar
nor
even
a
foundation
wall
they
stood
on
props
of
leaving
room
underneath
for
the
free
circulation
of
air
dogs
pigs
and
pickaninnies
on
either
side
of
the
house
the
cleared
lands
ran
a
considerable
distance
up
and
down
the
bayou
closing
in
the
rear
at
a
depth
of
three
or
four
hundred
yards
in
a
stretch
of
forest
an
eighth
of
a
mile
away
not
far
from
the
winding
road
which
skirted
the
sinuous
base
of
the
levee
was
the
most
expensive
building
of
the
plantation
the
great
brick
with
vast
expanses
of
black
roof
and
a
gigantic
chimney
no
smoke
of
industry
arose
from
it
the
sound
of
the
grinding
of
the
costly
steam
machinery
had
departed
the
vats
were
empty
and
dry
or
had
been
carried
away
for
bunks
and
by
foraging
soldiers
and
negroes
there
was
not
a
soul
in
any
of
the
buildings
or
about
the
grounds
when
the
ravenels
arrived
the
secessionist
family
of
robertson
had
fled
before
weitzel
advance
into
the
lafourche
country
and
its
chief
a
man
of
fifty
had
fallen
at
the
head
of
a
company
of
militia
at
the
fight
at
georgia
landing
then
the
who
had
hid
in
the
swamps
to
avoid
being
carried
to
texas
came
upon
the
house
like
locusts
of
destruction
broke
down
its
doors
shattered
its
windows
plundered
it
from
parlor
to
garret
drank
themselves
drunk
on
the
venerable
treasures
of
the
wine
closet
and
diverted
themselves
with
soiling
the
carpets
breaking
the
chairs
ripping
up
the
sofas
and
defacing
the
family
portraits
some
gentle
sentiment
perhaps
a
feeble
love
for
the
departed
young
missus
perhaps
the
passion
of
their
race
for
music
had
deterred
them
from
injuring
the
piano
which
was
almost
the
only
unharmed
piece
of
furniture
in
the
once
handsome
parlor
the
single
living
creature
about
the
place
was
a
grimalkin
who
caterwauled
dolefully
at
the
visitors
from
a
distance
and
could
not
be
enticed
to
approach
by
the
blandishments
of
lillie
an
enthusiastic
to
the
merely
sentimental
observer
it
was
sad
to
think
that
this
house
of
desolation
had
not
long
since
been
the
abode
of
the
generous
family
life
and
prodigal
hospitality
of
a
southern
planter
oh
how
doleful
it
looks
sighed
lillie
as
she
wandered
about
the
deserted
rooms
it
doleful
said
the
doctor
as
doleful
as
the
ruins
of
babylon
of
cities
accursed
of
god
and
smitten
for
their
wickedness
my
old
friend
elderkin
used
to
say
before
he
went
addled
about
southern
rights
that
he
wondered
god
did
strike
all
the
sugar
planters
of
louisiana
dead
well
he
stricken
them
with
stark
madness
and
under
the
influence
of
it
they
are
getting
themselves
killed
off
as
fast
as
possible
it
was
time
the
world
had
got
to
be
too
intelligent
for
them
they
could
not
live
without
retarding
the
progress
of
civilization
they
wanted
to
keep
up
the
social
systems
of
the
middle
ages
amidst
railroads
steamboats
telegraphs
patent
reapers
and
under
the
noses
of
humboldt
leverrier
lyell
and
agassiz
of
course
they
must
go
to
the
wall
they
will
be
pinned
up
to
it
like
exterminated
crows
and
the
grand
jury
of
future
centuries
will
bring
in
the
verdict
them
right
at
the
same
time
one
can
not
help
feeling
a
little
human
sympathy
or
at
any
rate
a
little
poetic
melancholy
on
stepping
thus
into
the
ruins
of
a
family
lillie
however
was
not
very
sentimental
about
the
departed
happiness
of
the
robertsons
she
was
planning
how
to
get
the
house
ready
for
the
expected
visit
of
colonel
carter
in
that
channel
for
the
present
ran
her
poesy
but
really
papa
we
must
go
to
work
she
said
the
nineteenth
century
has
turned
out
the
robertsons
and
put
us
in
but
it
has
left
these
rooms
awfully
dirty
and
the
furniture
in
a
dreadful
condition
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
her
hat
off
her
dress
pinned
up
to
keep
it
out
of
the
dust
her
sleeves
rolled
back
to
her
elbows
and
was
flying
about
with
remarkable
emphasis
dragging
broken
chairs
to
the
garret
and
brooming
up
such
whirlwinds
of
dust
that
the
doctor
flew
abroad
for
refuge
what
she
could
not
do
herself
she
set
half
a
dozen
negroes
male
and
female
to
doing
she
was
wild
with
excitement
and
gayety
running
about
ordering
and
laughing
like
a
threefold
creature
it
was
delightful
to
remember
in
a
sweet
of
thought
which
flowed
gently
beneath
her
external
glee
that
she
was
working
to
welcome
her
husband
slaving
for
him
tiring
herself
out
for
his
dear
sake
in
a
couple
of
hours
she
was
so
weary
that
she
had
to
fling
herself
on
a
settee
in
the
veranda
and
rest
while
the
negroes
continued
the
labor
women
in
general
i
believe
love
to
work
by
spasms
and
deliriums
doing
or
making
believe
do
a
vast
deal
while
they
are
at
it
but
dropping
off
presently
into
languor
and
headache
papa
we
shall
have
five
whole
chairs
she
called
you
can
sit
in
one
i
in
another
and
that
will
leave
three
for
carter
why
you
come
and
do
something
i
have
fagged
myself
half
to
death
and
you
have
done
a
thing
but
mope
about
with
your
hands
behind
your
back
come
in
now
and
go
to
work
my
dear
there
are
so
many
negroes
in
there
that
i
ca
get
in
then
come
up
and
talk
to
me
commanded
the
young
lady
who
had
meant
that
all
the
while
you
need
think
you
can
find
any
smithites
or
robinsonites
there
is
a
mineral
in
louisiana
unless
it
is
a
brickbat
do
come
up
here
and
talk
to
me
i
ca
scream
to
you
all
the
afternoon
i
am
so
glad
you
ca
grinned
papa
and
strolled
obstinately
away
in
the
direction
of
the
he
was
studying
the
nature
of
the
soil
and
proposing
to
subject
it
to
a
chemical
analysis
in
order
to
see
if
it
could
not
be
made
to
produce
as
much
corn
to
the
acre
as
the
bottom
lands
of
ohio
indian
corn
and
sweet
potatoes
with
a
little
seasoning
of
onions
beets
squashes
and
other
kitchen
garden
vegetables
should
be
his
only
crop
that
season
also
he
would
raise
pigs
and
chickens
by
the
hundred
and
perhaps
three
or
four
cows
if
promising
calves
could
be
obtained
in
the
country
what
new
orleans
wanted
and
what
the
whole
department
would
stand
in
desperate
need
of
should
a
war
break
out
with
france
was
not
sugar
but
corn
and
pork
all
that
summer
the
possibility
of
a
war
with
france
was
a
prominent
topic
of
conversation
in
louisiana
so
that
even
the
soldiers
talked
in
their
rough
way
of
revelling
in
the
halls
of
the
montezumas
and
filling
their
pockets
with
little
gold
jesuses
as
for
making
sugar
unless
it
might
be
a
hogshead
or
so
for
family
consumption
it
was
out
of
the
question
it
would
cost
twenty
thousand
dollars
merely
to
put
the
and
its
machinery
to
rights
and
the
doctor
had
no
such
riches
nor
any
thing
approaching
to
it
this
side
of
heaven
nevertheless
he
was
perfectly
happy
in
strolling
about
his
unplanted
estate
and
revolving
his
unfulfilled
plans
agricultural
and
humanitarian
he
proposed
to
produce
not
only
a
crop
of
corn
and
potatoes
but
a
race
of
intelligent
industrious
and
virtuous
laborers
he
would
make
himself
analytically
acquainted
not
only
with
the
elements
and
possibilities
of
the
soil
but
with
those
of
the
negro
soul
by
the
way
i
ought
to
mention
that
he
was
not
proprietor
of
the
plantation
but
only
a
tenant
of
it
to
the
united
states
paying
a
rent
which
for
the
first
year
was
merely
nominal
so
anxious
was
authority
to
initiate
successfully
the
grand
experiment
of
freedmen
labor
when
he
returned
to
the
house
from
a
stroll
of
two
hours
lillie
favored
him
with
a
good
imitation
of
a
sound
scolding
what
did
he
mean
by
leaving
her
alone
so
without
anybody
to
speak
a
word
to
if
he
was
going
to
be
always
out
in
this
way
they
might
as
well
live
in
new
orleans
where
he
would
be
fussing
around
his
hospital
from
morning
till
night
she
was
tired
with
overseeing
those
stupid
negroes
and
trying
to
make
them
set
the
chairs
and
tables
right
side
up
my
dear
do
reproach
them
for
being
stupid
said
ravenel
for
nearly
a
century
the
whole
power
of
our
great
republic
north
and
south
has
been
devoted
to
keeping
them
stupid
your
own
state
has
taken
a
demoniac
interest
in
this
infernal
labor
we
must
quarrel
with
our
own
deliberate
productions
we
wanted
stupidity
we
have
got
it
and
we
must
be
contented
with
it
at
least
for
a
while
it
is
your
duty
and
mine
to
work
patiently
courteously
and
faithfully
to
undo
the
horrid
results
of
a
century
of
selfishness
i
shall
expect
you
to
teach
all
these
poor
people
to
read
teach
them
to
read
what
set
up
a
nigger
school
yes
you
born
barbarian
and
daughter
of
a
born
barbarian
for
i
felt
that
way
myself
once
i
want
you
in
the
first
place
to
teach
them
and
yourself
too
how
to
spell
negro
with
only
one
you
must
not
add
your
efforts
to
keep
this
abused
race
under
a
stigma
of
social
contempt
you
must
do
what
you
can
to
elevate
them
in
sentiment
and
in
knowledge
but
oh
what
a
labor
i
would
rather
clean
house
every
day
not
so
very
much
of
a
labor
not
so
very
much
of
a
labor
insisted
the
doctor
negro
children
are
just
as
intelligent
as
white
children
until
they
find
out
that
they
are
black
now
we
will
never
tell
them
that
they
are
black
we
will
never
hint
to
them
that
they
are
born
our
inferiors
you
will
find
them
bright
enough
if
you
wo
knock
them
on
the
head
why
you
could
read
yourself
till
you
were
seven
years
old
because
you
did
care
to
have
me
i
learned
quick
enough
when
i
set
about
it
just
so
and
that
proves
that
it
is
not
too
late
for
our
people
here
to
commence
their
education
adults
can
beat
children
at
the
alphabet
but
it
is
against
the
law
teaching
them
to
read
the
doctor
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
the
laws
of
dahomey
are
abrogated
said
he
what
a
fossil
you
are
you
remind
me
of
my
poor
doting
old
friend
elderkin
who
persists
in
declaring
that
the
invasion
of
louisiana
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
by
this
time
the
dozen
or
so
of
negroes
had
brought
the
neglected
mansion
to
a
habitable
degree
of
cleanliness
and
decked
out
two
or
three
rooms
with
what
tags
and
amputated
fragments
remained
of
the
once
fine
furniture
a
chamber
had
been
prepared
for
lillie
and
another
for
the
doctor
a
was
set
in
a
picnic
sort
of
style
and
crowned
with
corn
cake
fried
pork
and
roasted
sweet
potatoes
are
you
not
going
to
ask
in
our
colored
friends
inquired
lillie
mischievously
why
no
i
do
see
the
logical
necessity
of
it
i
always
have
claimed
the
right
of
selecting
my
own
intimates
i
admit
however
that
i
have
sat
at
table
with
less
respectable
people
in
some
of
the
most
aristocratic
houses
of
new
orleans
please
to
drop
the
satire
and
put
some
sugar
in
my
tea
mercy
there
is
no
sugar
on
the
table
the
stupid
creatures
how
can
you
wonder
papa
that
i
allow
myself
to
look
down
on
them
a
little
i
do
believe
it
is
possible
to
get
all
the
virtues
and
all
the
talents
for
nothing
a
year
or
even
for
ten
dollars
a
month
i
will
try
to
induce
the
commanding
to
come
and
wait
on
table
for
us
but
i
am
really
afraid
i
succeed
he
is
very
busy
meantime
suppose
you
should
hint
to
one
of
the
handmaidens
as
politely
as
you
can
that
i
am
accustomed
to
take
sugar
in
my
tea
julia
called
lillie
to
a
mulatto
girl
of
eighteen
who
just
then
entered
from
the
kitchen
you
have
given
us
no
sugar
how
could
you
be
so
silly
do
expostulated
the
doctor
i
never
knew
a
woman
but
scolded
her
servants
and
i
never
knew
a
servant
but
waited
the
worse
for
it
all
that
the
creature
desired
was
to
know
what
you
wanted
it
did
clear
her
head
nor
soften
her
heart
a
bit
to
call
her
silly
nor
would
it
have
helped
matters
at
all
if
you
had
gone
on
to
pelt
her
with
all
the
hard
names
in
the
english
language
be
courteous
my
dear
to
everything
that
is
human
we
owe
that
much
of
respect
to
the
fact
that
man
is
made
in
the
image
of
his
maker
politeness
is
a
part
of
piety
when
would
carter
be
able
to
visit
them
was
lillie
next
spoken
idea
papa
really
could
not
say
but
hoped
very
soon
whereupon
he
was
immediately
questioned
as
to
the
reasons
of
his
hope
having
no
special
reason
to
allege
and
being
driven
to
admit
that
after
all
the
visit
could
not
positively
be
counted
upon
he
was
sharply
catechised
as
to
he
thought
carter
would
not
come
to
which
he
could
only
reply
by
denying
he
had
entertained
such
a
thought
then
followed
in
rapid
succession
suppose
the
brigade
leaves
thibodeaux
where
will
it
go
to
suppose
general
banks
attacks
port
hudson
wo
he
be
obliged
to
leave
colonel
carter
to
defend
the
lafourche
interior
suppose
the
brigade
is
ordered
into
the
field
will
it
not
being
the
best
brigade
be
always
kept
in
reserve
out
of
the
range
of
fire
my
dear
child
deprecated
the
hunted
doctor
what
happy
people
those
early
greeks
must
have
been
who
were
descended
from
the
immortal
gods
they
could
ask
their
papas
all
sorts
of
questions
about
the
future
and
get
reliable
answers
but
i
am
anxious
said
lillie
dropping
back
in
her
chair
with
a
sob
and
wiping
away
her
tears
with
her
napkin
my
poor
dear
little
girl
you
must
try
to
keep
up
a
better
courage
urged
papa
in
a
compassionate
tone
which
only
made
the
drops
fall
faster
so
affecting
is
pity
nothing
has
happened
to
him
yet
and
we
have
a
right
to
hope
and
pray
that
nothing
will
but
something
was
the
persevering
answer
of
anxiety
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
she
hurried
to
her
room
locked
the
door
knelt
on
the
bit
of
carpet
by
the
bedside
buried
her
face
in
the
and
prayed
a
long
time
with
tears
and
sobs
that
her
husband
her
own
and
dear
husband
might
be
kept
from
danger
she
did
not
even
ask
that
he
might
be
brought
to
her
it
was
enough
if
he
might
only
be
delivered
from
the
awful
perils
of
battle
in
the
humility
of
her
earnestness
and
terror
she
had
not
the
face
to
require
more
after
a
while
she
went
down
stairs
again
with
an
expression
of
placid
exhaustion
rendered
sweeter
by
a
soft
glory
of
religious
trust
as
the
sunset
mellowness
of
our
earthly
atmosphere
is
rayed
by
beams
from
a
mightier
world
sitting
on
a
stool
at
her
father
feet
and
laying
her
head
on
his
knee
she
talked
in
more
cheerful
tones
of
carter
of
their
own
prospects
and
then
again
of
carter
for
ever
of
carter
i
teach
the
negroes
to
read
she
said
i
will
try
to
do
good
and
to
be
good
she
was
thinking
how
she
could
best
win
the
favor
and
protection
of
heaven
for
her
husband
she
would
teach
the
negroes
for
carter
sake
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
do
it
for
jesus
christ
sake
she
was
not
a
heathen
she
had
received
the
same
evangelical
instruction
that
most
young
americans
receive
she
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
the
doctrine
of
salvation
by
faith
and
not
by
works
but
no
profound
sorrow
no
awful
sense
of
helplessness
under
the
threatening
of
dangers
to
those
whom
she
dearly
loved
had
ever
made
these
things
matters
of
personal
experience
and
realizing
belief
when
the
doctor
called
in
the
negroes
at
nine
and
read
to
them
a
chapter
from
the
bible
and
a
prayer
lillie
joined
in
the
devotions
with
an
unusual
sense
of
humility
and
earnestness
in
her
own
room
before
going
to
bed
she
prayed
again
for
carter
and
not
for
him
only
but
for
herself
then
she
quickly
fell
asleep
for
she
was
young
and
very
tired
how
some
elderly
people
who
have
learned
to
toss
and
count
the
hours
till
near
morning
envy
these
infants
whether
of
twenty
months
or
twenty
years
who
can
so
readily
cast
their
sorrows
into
the
profound
and
tranquil
ocean
of
slumber
chapter
xix
the
reorganization
of
southern
labor
is
continued
with
vigor
by
six
in
the
morning
the
doctor
was
out
visiting
the
quarters
of
his
sable
dependants
having
on
the
previous
evening
told
major
scott
the
head
man
or
overseer
of
the
gang
that
he
should
expect
the
people
to
rise
by
daybreak
and
get
their
breakfasts
immediately
so
as
to
be
ready
for
early
work
he
was
a
little
astonished
to
find
half
of
them
still
asleep
and
two
or
three
absent
the
major
himself
was
just
leaving
the
in
rear
of
the
plantation
house
where
he
had
evidently
been
performing
his
morning
ablutions
scott
said
the
doctor
you
should
use
that
water
the
butt
holds
hardly
enough
for
the
family
yes
sah
answered
with
a
reverential
bow
the
major
but
the
butt
that
we
has
is
mighty
dry
but
there
is
the
bayou
close
by
yes
sah
so
is
assented
the
major
with
another
bow
i
guess
think
of
that
nex
time
but
what
are
you
all
about
asked
the
doctor
i
understood
that
you
were
all
to
be
up
and
ready
for
work
by
this
time
i
tole
the
boys
so
said
the
major
in
a
tone
of
indignant
virtue
i
tole
every
one
to
be
up
an
about
right
smart
this
mornin
i
tole
this
was
the
fust

scott

the
ole
woman

fetch
nothin
to
pass
this
mornin
well
scott
you
must
set
them
an
example
if
you
want
to
influence
them
never
enjoin
any
duty
upon
a
man
without
setting
him
an
example
yes
sah
that
the
true
way
coincided
the
unabashed
major
the
way
abraham
an
isaac
an
jacob
went
at
it
he
added
turning
his
large
eyes
upward
with
a
sanctimoniousness
of
effect
which
most
men
could
not
have
equalled
without
the
aid
of
lifted
hands
tonsures
and
priestly
gowns
an
they
was
god
an
by
his
holy
sperrit
the
doctor
studied
him
for
a
moment
with
the
interest
of
a
philosopher
in
a
moral
curiosity
and
said
to
himself
rather
sadly
that
a
monkey
or
a
parrot
might
be
educated
to
very
nearly
the
same
show
of
piety
are
all
the
people
here
he
inquired
reverting
from
a
consideration
of
the
spiritual
harvest
to
matters
connected
with
temporal
agriculture
no
sah
feared
not
tom
an
jim
is
gone
fo
suah
tom
he
went
off
las
night
down
to
the
fote
like

jim
don
know
whar
jim
is
nohow
mighty
poor
mean
nigger
he
is
i
specs
sort
o
no
nigger
is
he
said
the
doctor
eyeing
scott
with
a
suspicious
air
as
if
considering
the
possibility
that
he
too
might
be
a
negro
of
no
account
i
must
have
a
talk
with
these
people
get
them
all
together
every
man
woman
and
pickaninny
the
major
face
was
radiant
at
the
prospect
of
a
speech
a
scene
a
spectacle
an
excitement
he
went
at
his
subordinates
with
a
will
dragging
them
out
of
their
slumbers
by
the
heels
jerking
the
little
ones
along
by
the
shoulder
and
shouting
in
a
grand
bass
voice
come
start
pile
out
git
away
frum
hyer
mars
ravenel
gwine
to
make
a
speech
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
them
drawn
up
in
two
ranks
men
in
front
women
in
the
rear
tallest
on
the
right
younglings
on
the
left
i
knows
how
to
form
he
said
with
a
broad
smile
of
satisfied
vanity
i
used
to
a
under
gineral
phelps
i
was
head
boss
of
his
cullud
he
fus
give
me
the
title
of
major
he
took
his
post
on
the
right
of
the
line
honored
the
doctor
with
a
military
salute
and
commanded
in
a
hollow
roar
my
friends
said
the
doctor
we
are
all
here
to
earn
our
living
that
so
bress
the
lawd
the
good
time
am
a
comin
from
the
not
unintelligent
audience
hear
me
patiently
and
do
interrupt
continued
the
doctor
i
see
that
you
understand
and
appreciate
your
good
fortune
in
being
able
at
last
to
work
for
the
wages
of
freedom
yes
in
a
subdued
hoarse
whisper
from
major
scott
who
immediately
apologized
for
his
liberty
by
a
particularly
grand
military
salute
i
want
to
impress
upon
you
said
ravenel
that
the
true
dignity
of
freedom
does
not
consist
in
laziness
a
lazy
man
is
sure
to
be
a
poor
man
and
a
poor
man
is
never
quite
a
free
man
he
is
not
free
to
buy
what
he
would
like
because
he
has
no
money
he
is
not
free
to
respect
himself
for
a
lazy
man
is
not
worthy
even
of
his
own
respect
we
must
all
work
to
get
any
thing
or
deserve
any
thing
in
old
times
you
used
to
work
because
you
were
afraid
of
the
overseer
whip
he
was
about
to
say
but
skipped
the
degrading
word
now
you
are
to
work
from
hope
and
not
from
fear
the
good
time
has
come
when
our
nation
has
resolved
to
declare
that
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
oh
the
blessed
scripter
shouted
madam
scott
in
a
piercing
pipe
whereupon
her
husband
gave
her
a
glare
of
reproof
for
daring
to
speak
when
he
was
silent
your
future
depends
upon
yourselves
the
doctor
went
on
you
can
become
useful
and
even
influential
citizens
if
you
will
but
you
must
be
industrious
and
honest
and
faithful
to
your
engagements
i
want
you
to
understand
this
perfectly
i
will
talk
more
to
you
about
it
some
other
time
just
now
i
wish
chiefly
to
impress
upon
you
your
immediate
duties
while
you
are
on
this
plantation
i
shall
expect
you
all
to
sleep
in
your
quarters
i
shall
expect
you
to
be
up
at
daybreak
get
your
breakfasts
as
soon
as
possible
and
be
ready
to
go
to
work
at
once
you
must
not
leave
the
plantation
during
the
day
without
my
permission
you
will
work
ten
hours
a
day
during
the
working
season
you
will
be
orderly
honest
virtuous
and
respectable
in
return
i
am
to
give
you
rations
clothing
quarters
fuel
medical
attendance
and
instruction
for
children
i
am
also
to
pay
you
as
wages
eight
dollars
a
month
for
hands
and
six
for
each
of
you
will
have
his
little
plot
of
land
finally
i
will
endeavor
to
see
that
you
are
all
old
and
young
taught
to
read
here
there
was
an
unanimous
shout
of
delight
followed
by
articulate
blessings
and
utterances
of
gratitude
whenever
any
one
gets
dissatisfied
concluded
the
doctor
i
will
apply
to
find
him
another
place
you
know
that
if
you
go
off
alone
and
without
authority
you
are
exposed
to
be
picked
up
by
the
and
put
in
the
army
now
then
get
your
breakfasts
major
scott
you
will
report
to
me
when
they
are
ready
to
go
to
work
while
the
major
offered
up
a
ponderous
salute
the
line
dispersed
in
gleesome
confusion
which
was
a
sore
disappointment
to
him
as
he
wanted
to
make
it
right
face
clap
hands
and
break
ranks
in
military
fashion
the
doctor
went
to
breakfast
with
the
most
cheerful
confidence
in
his
retainers
notwithstanding
the
idle
opening
of
this
morning
as
soon
as
the
poor
fellows
knew
what
he
expected
of
them
they
would
be
sure
to
do
it
if
it
was
anything
in
reason
he
said
to
lillie
the
negroes
were
ignorant
of
their
duty
and
often
thoughtless
of
it
but
they
were
at
bottom
zealous
to
do
right
and
honestly
disposed
toward
people
who
paid
them
for
their
labor
and
here
the
author
ventures
to
introduce
the
historical
doubt
as
to
whether
any
other
race
was
ever
blessed
and
beautified
with
such
a
lovingly
grateful
spirit
as
descended
like
the
flames
of
the
day
of
pentecost
upon
the
bondsmen
of
america
when
their
chains
were
broken
by
the
just
hands
of
the
great
republic
impure
in
life
by
reason
of
their
immemorial
degradation
first
as
savages
and
then
as
slaves
they
were
pure
in
heart
by
reason
of
their
fervent
joy
and
love
under
no
urgency
but
that
of
their
own
thankfulness
the
doctor
negroes
did
more
work
that
summer
than
the
robertsons
had
ever
got
from
double
their
number
by
the
agency
of
a
white
overseer
drivers
whips
and
paddles
on
the
second
morning
they
were
all
present
and
up
at
daybreak
including
even
tom
the
lovelorn
and
jim
the
no
nigger
in
a
couple
of
weeks
they
had
split
out
many
of
rails
from
the
forest
in
rear
of
the
plantation
put
the
fences
in
order
and
prepared
a
sufficient
tract
of
ground
for
planting
not
a
pig
nor
a
chicken
disappeared
from
the
doctor
flocks
and
herds
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
apply
such
magnificent
terms
to
bristly
and
feathered
creatures
on
the
contrary
his
small
store
of
increased
with
a
rapidity
which
seemed
miraculous
and
which
was
inadequately
explained
by
the
commentary
of
major
scott
specs
it
mebbe
in
anser
to
prayer
ravenel
finally
learned
to
his
intense
mortification
that
his
henchmen
were
in
the
habit
of
depredating
nightly
on
the
property
of
adjacent
planters
of
the
old
secession
stock
and
adding
such
of
their
spoils
as
they
did
not
need
to
his
limited
zoological
collection
under
the
pangs
of
this
discovery
he
made
a
tour
of
apology
and
restitution
through
the
neighborhood
and
on
returning
from
it
called
his
hands
together
and
delivered
them
a
lecture
on
the
universal
application
of
the
law
of
honesty
they
heard
him
with
suppressed
titters
and
hastily
eclipsed
grins
nudging
each
other
in
the
side
and
exhibiting
a
keen
perception
of
the
practical
humor
and
poetical
justice
of
their
roguery
like
you
don
wan
to
spile
the
mars
ravenel
observed
a
smirking
shining
darkey
known
as
mo
you
one
o
chosen
people
an
you
been
in
slavery
somethin
like
we
has
an
you
has
a
right
to
dese
yere
rebel
chickins
my
good
people
replied
the
doctor
i
do
say
but
that
have
a
right
to
all
the
rebel
chickens
in
louisiana
i
deny
that
i
have
i
have
always
been
well
paid
for
my
labor
and
even
to
you
i
would
say
be
forgiving
be
magnanimous
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
evil
it
is
your
great
business
your
great
duty
toward
yourselves
to
establish
a
character
for
perfect
honesty
and
harmlessness
if
you
have
enough
to
eat
i
do
mind
adding
something
to
your
rations
we
to
eat
thundered
major
scott
let
the
man
as
says
we
has
step
out
nobody
stepped
out
everybody
was
full
of
nourishment
and
content
and
the
interview
terminated
in
a
buzz
of
satisfaction
and
suppressed
laughter
thenceforward
the
doctor
had
the
virtuous
pleasure
of
observing
that
his
legitimate
pigs
and
chickens
were
left
to
their
natural
means
of
increase
lillie
reading
schools
held
every
evening
in
one
of
the
unfurnished
rooms
of
the
second
story
were
attended
regularly
by
both
sexes
and
all
ages
of
this
black
population
the
rapidity
of
their
progress
at
first
astonished
and
eventually
delighted
her
in
proportion
as
she
gradually
took
her
ignorant
but
zealous
scholars
to
her
heart
the
eagerness
the
joy
the
gratitude
even
to
tears
with
which
they
accepted
her
tuition
was
touching
they
pronounced
the
words
miss
lillie
with
a
tone
and
manner
which
seemed
to
lay
soul
and
body
at
her
feet
and
when
the
doctor
entered
the
schoolroom
on
one
of
his
visits
of
inspection
they
gave
him
a
dazzling
welcome
of
grins
and
rolling
eyes
the
spectacle
reminded
him
vaguely
of
such
spiritual
expressions
crowns
of
glory
and
stars
in
the
firmament
if
the
gratitude
of
the
humble
is
a
benediction
few
people
have
ever
been
more
blessed
than
were
the
ravenels
at
this
period
as
a
truthful
historian
i
must
admit
that
there
were
some
rotten
specks
in
the
social
fruit
which
the
doctor
was
trying
to
raise
from
this
barbarous
stock
lillie
was
annoyed
was
even
put
out
of
all
patience
temporarily
by
occasional
scandals
which
came
to
light
among
her
sable
pupils
and
were
referred
to
her
or
to
her
father
for
settlement
that
eminent
dignitary
and
supposed
exemplar
of
purity
major
scott
was
the
very
first
to
be
detected
in
capital
sin
the
scandal
being
all
the
more
grievous
because
he
was
not
only
the
appointed
industrial
manager
but
the
spiritual
overseer
of
the
colored
community
he
preached
to
them
every
sunday
afternoon
and
secretly
plumed
himself
on
being
more
fluent
by
many
degrees
than
mars
ravenel
who
conducted
the
morning
exercises
chiefly
through
the
agency
of
bible
and
his
copiousness
of
language
and
abundance
of
scriptural
quotation
was
quite
wonderful
in
volume
of
sound
his
praying
was
as
if
a
bull
of
bashan
had
had
a
gift
in
prayer
and
if
heaven
could
have
been
taken
like
jericho
by
mere
noise
major
scott
was
able
to
take
it
alone
had
he
been
born
white
and
decently
educated
he
would
probably
have
made
a
popular
orator
either
of
the
pulpit
or
forum
he
had
the
lungs
for
it
the
volubility
and
the
imagination
in
pious
conversation
venerable
air
grand
physique
superb
bass
voice
musical
ear
perfection
of
teeth
and
shining
white
of
the
eyes
he
was
a
counterpart
of
stowe
immortal
idealism
uncle
tom
but
like
some
white
christians
this
tolerably
exemplary
black
had
not
yet
arrived
at
the
ability
to
keep
the
whole
decalogue
he
sometimes
got
a
fall
in
his
wrestlings
with
the
sin
of
lying
and
in
regard
to
the
seventh
commandment
he
was
even
more
liable
to
overthrow
than
king
david
ravenel
had
much
ado
to
heal
some
social
caused
by
the
major
want
of
illumination
concerning
the
binding
nature
of
the
marriage
contract
he
got
him
married
over
again
by
the
chaplain
of
the
garrison
at
fort
winthrop
and
then
informed
him
that
in
case
of
any
more
scandals
he
should
report
him
to
the
as
a
proper
character
to
enter
the
army
very
sorry
for
what
come
to
pass
mars
ravenel
said
the
alarmed
and
repentant
culprit
but
now
i
to
go
right
forrad
in
the
path
of
duty
i
now
mars
chaplain
has
done
it
strong
ye
see
afore
it
was
done
strong
i
was
rightly
married
like
folks
is
nohow
ef
i
been
married
right
strong
like
white
folks
is
i
would
got
into
this
muss
an
fotched
down
shame
on
for
which
mighty
sorry
an
been
about
repentin
in
secret
places
with
many
tears
that
so
mars
ravenel
as
true
as
i
hopes
to
be
forgiven
here
the
major
manhood
what
he
had
of
it
broke
down
or
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
showed
itself
honorably
and
he
wept
copious
tears
of
what
i
must
charitably
accept
as
true
compunction
i
am
a
little
disappointed
but
not
much
astonished
said
the
doctor
discussing
this
matter
with
the
chaplain
i
was
inclined
to
hope
at
one
time
that
i
had
found
an
actual
uncle
tom
i
was
anxious
and
even
ready
to
believe
that
the
mere
gift
of
freedom
had
exalted
and
purified
the
negro
character
notwithstanding
uncounted
centuries
of
barbarism
or
of
oppression
but
in
hoping
a
moral
miracle
i
was
hoping
too
much
i
ought
not
to
have
expected
that
a
vincent
de
paul
could
be
raised
under
the
injustice
and
dissoluteness
of
the
system
after
all
the
major
is
no
worse
than
david
that
is
pretty
well
for
a
man
whom
the
american
republic
thirty
millions
strong
has
repressed
and
kept
brutish
with
its
whole
power
from
his
birth
down
to
about
a
year
ago
it
seems
to
me
answered
the
chaplain
i
beg
your
pardon
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
do
sufficiently
consider
the
enlightening
power
of
divine
grace
if
this
man
had
ever
been
truly
regenerated
which
i
fear
is
not
the
case
i
doubt
whether
he
would
have
fallen
into
this
sin
my
dear
sir
said
the
doctor
warmly
renewing
a
man
heart
is
only
a
partial
reformation
unless
you
illuminate
his
mind
he
wants
to
do
right
but
how
is
he
to
know
what
is
right
suppose
he
ca
read
suppose
half
of
the
bible
is
not
told
him
suppose
he
is
misled
by
half
the
teaching
and
all
the
example
of
those
whom
he
looks
up
to
as
in
every
respect
his
superiors
i
am
disposed
to
regard
scott
as
a
very
fair
attempt
at
a
christian
considering
his
chances
i
am
grieved
over
his
error
but
i
do
not
think
it
a
case
for
righteous
indignation
except
against
men
who
brought
this
poor
fellow
up
so
badly
but
uncle
tom
instanced
the
chaplain
who
had
not
been
long
in
the
south
my
dear
sir
uncle
tom
is
a
pure
fiction
there
never
was
such
a
slave
and
there
never
will
be
a
man
educated
under
the
degrading
influences
of
bondage
must
always
have
some
taint
of
uncommon
grossness
and
lowness
i
do
believe
that
onesimus
was
a
pattern
of
piety
but
paul
had
the
moral
sense
the
christianity
to
make
allowance
for
his
disadvantages
and
he
recommended
him
to
philemon
no
doubt
as
a
weak
brother
who
required
special
charity
and
instruction
injured
husbands
of
the
breed
are
rarely
implacable
in
their
anger
and
before
a
fortnight
had
passed
major
scott
was
preaching
and
praying
among
his
colored
brethren
with
as
much
confidence
and
acceptance
as
ever
the
season
opened
delightfully
with
the
ravenels
lillie
was
occasionally
doleful
at
not
getting
letters
from
her
husband
and
sometimes
depressed
by
the
solitude
and
monotony
of
plantation
life
her
father
being
more
steadily
occupied
and
having
no
affectionate
worry
on
his
mind
was
constantly
and
almost
boyishly
cheerful
it
was
one
of
his
characteristics
to
be
contented
under
nearly
any
circumstances
wherever
he
happened
to
be
he
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
place
and
if
he
afterwards
found
a
spot
with
superior
advantages
he
simply
liked
it
better
still
i
can
easily
believe
that
but
for
the
stigma
of
forced
confinement
he
would
have
been
quite
happy
in
a
prison
and
that
on
regaining
his
liberty
he
would
simply
have
remarked
why
it
is
even
pleasanter
outside
than
in
but
i
am
running
ahead
of
some
important
events
in
my
story
lillie
received
a
letter
from
her
husband
saying
that
he
should
visit
the
family
soon
and
then
another
informing
her
that
in
consequence
of
an
unforeseen
press
of
business
he
should
be
obliged
to
postpone
the
visit
for
a
few
days
his
two
next
letters
were
written
from
brashear
city
on
the
atchafalaya
river
but
contained
no
explanation
of
his
presence
there
then
came
a
silence
of
three
days
which
caused
her
to
torture
herself
with
all
sorts
of
gloomy
doubts
and
fears
and
made
her
fly
for
forgetfulness
or
comfort
to
her
housekeeping
her
school
and
her
now
frequent
private
devotions
the
riddle
was
explained
when
the
doctor
procured
a
new
orleans
paper
at
the
fort
with
the
news
that
banks
had
crossed
the
atchafalaya
and
beaten
the
enemy
at
camp
beasland
it
all
right
he
said
as
he
entered
the
house
he
waved
the
paper
triumphantly
and
smiled
with
a
counterfeit
delight
anxious
to
forestall
her
alarm
oh
what
is
it
asked
lillie
with
a
choking
sensation
fearful
that
it
might
not
be
quite
as
right
as
she
wanted
banks
has
defeated
the
enemy
in
a
great
battle
colonel
carter
is
unhurt
and
honorably
mentioned
for
bravery
and
ability
oh
papa
she
had
turned
very
white
at
the
thought
of
the
peril
through
which
her
husband
had
passed
and
the
possibility
instantaneously
foreseen
that
he
might
be
called
to
encounter
yet
other
dangers
we
ought
to
be
very
grateful
my
darling
oh
why
has
he
gone
why
did
he
tell
me
that
he
was
going
why
did
he
leave
me
so
in
the
dark
was
all
that
lillie
could
say
in
the
way
of
thankfulness
my
child
do
be
unreasonable
he
wished
of
course
to
save
you
from
unnecessary
anxiety
it
was
very
kind
and
wise
in
him
lillie
snatched
the
paper
ran
to
her
own
room
and
read
the
official
bulletin
over
and
over
dropping
her
tears
upon
it
and
kissing
the
place
where
her
husband
was
praised
and
recommended
for
promotion
then
she
thought
how
generous
and
grand
he
was
to
go
forth
to
battle
in
silence
without
uttering
a
word
to
alarm
her
without
making
an
appeal
for
her
sympathy
the
greatest
men
of
history
have
not
seemed
so
great
to
the
world
as
did
this
almost
unknown
colonel
of
volunteers
to
his
wife
she
was
in
a
passion
an
almost
unearthly
ecstasy
of
grief
terror
admiration
and
love
it
is
well
that
we
can
not
always
feel
thus
strongly
if
we
did
we
should
not
average
twenty
years
of
life
if
we
did
the
human
race
would
perish
next
day
came
two
letters
from
carter
one
written
before
and
one
after
the
battle
in
his
description
of
the
fighting
he
was
as
professional
brief
and
unenthusiastic
as
usual
merely
mentioning
the
fact
of
success
narrating
in
two
sentences
the
part
which
his
brigade
had
taken
in
the
action
and
saying
nothing
of
his
own
dangers
or
performances
but
there
was
another
subject
on
which
he
was
more
copious
and
this
part
of
the
letter
lillie
prized
most
of
all
i
am
afraid
i
sicken
you
with
such
fondness
he
concluded
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
get
tired
of
reading
over
and
over
again
the
same
endearing
phrases
and
pet
names
oh
never
imagine
that
i
can
sicken
of
hearing
or
reading
that
you
love
me
she
answered
you
must
not
cheat
me
of
a
single
pet
name
you
must
call
me
by
such
names
over
and
over
in
every
letter
i
always
skim
through
your
letters
to
read
those
dear
words
first
i
should
be
utterly
and
forever
miserable
if
i
did
not
believe
that
you
love
me
and
did
not
hear
so
from
you
constantly
at
this
time
lillie
knew
by
heart
all
her
husband
letters
let
her
eye
rest
on
the
envelope
of
one
which
she
had
received
a
week
or
a
fortnight
previous
and
she
could
repeat
its
contents
almost
verbatim
certainly
not
missing
one
of
the
loving
phrases
aforesaid
through
the
new
orleans
papers
and
these
same
wonderful
epistles
she
followed
the
victorious
army
in
its
onward
march
now
at
franklin
now
at
opelousas
and
now
at
alexandria
it
was
all
good
news
except
that
her
husband
was
forever
going
farther
away
the
rebels
were
always
flying
the
triumphant
unionists
were
always
pursuing
and
there
were
no
more
battles
she
flattered
herself
that
the
summer
campaign
was
over
and
that
carter
would
soon
get
a
leave
of
absence
and
come
to
his
own
home
to
be
petted
and
worshipped
from
alexandria
arrived
a
letter
of
colburne
to
the
doctor
the
young
man
had
needed
all
this
time
and
these
events
to
fortify
him
for
the
task
of
writing
to
the
ravenels
for
a
while
after
that
marriage
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
never
could
have
the
courage
to
meet
them
nor
even
call
to
their
attention
the
fact
of
his
continued
existence
his
congratulations
were
written
with
labored
care
and
the
rest
of
the
letter
in
a
style
of
affected
gayety
i
shall
copy
from
it
a
single
extract
because
it
bears
some
relation
to
the
grand
reconstruction
experiment
of
the
doctor
i
hear
that
you
are
doing
your
part
towards
organizing
free
labor
in
louisiana
i
fear
that
you
will
find
it
an
business
not
only
from
the
nature
of
your
surroundings
but
from
that
of
your
material
i
am
as
much
of
an
abolitionist
as
ever
but
not
so
much
of
a
i
do
know
but
that
i
shall
yet
become
an
advocate
of
slavery
i
frequently
think
that
my
boy
henry
will
fetch
me
to
it
he
is
an
awful
boy
he
dances
and
gambles
all
night
and
then
wants
to
sleep
all
day
if
the
nights
and
days
were
a
thousand
years
long
apiece
he
would
keep
it
up
in
the
same
fashion
in
order
that
he
may
not
be
disturbed
in
his
rest
by
my
voice
he
goes
away
from
camp
and
curls
up
in
some
refuge
which
i
have
not
yet
discovered
i
pass
hours
every
day
in
shouting
for
henry
of
course
his
labors
are
small
and
far
between
he
brushes
my
boots
in
the
morning
because
he
does
go
to
bed
till
after
i
get
up
but
if
i
want
them
polished
during
the
day
at
for
instance
it
is
not
henry
who
polishes
them
when
i
scold
him
for
his
worthlessness
he
laughs
most
obstropolously
i
value
myself
on
this
word
because
to
my
ear
it
describes
henry
laughter
exactly
for
his
services
or
rather
for
what
he
ought
to
do
and
does
i
pay
him
ten
dollars
a
month
with
rations
and
clothing
he
might
earn
two
or
three
times
as
much
on
the
levee
at
new
orleans
but
the
lazy
creature
would
rather
not
earn
anything
he
likes
to
get
his
living
gratis
as
he
does
with
me
this
is
the
way
he
came
to
join
me
when
i
was
last
in
new
orleans
henry
whom
i
had
previously
known
as
the
body
servant
of
one
of
my
sergeants
paid
me
a
visit
said
i
are
you
doing
on
levee
much
do
you
get
to
what
i
doos
ef
i
totes
a
big
stent
i
gits
two
dollars
an
ef
i
totes
to
kill
a
hoss
i
gits
two
dollars
a
day
that
is
grand
pay
that
is
a
great
deal
better
than
hanging
around
camp
for
nothing
but
your
board
and
clothes
i
am
glad
you
have
gone
at
some
profitable
and
manly
labor
stick
to
it
and
make
a
man
of
yourself
get
some
money
in
the
bank
and
then
give
yourself
a
little
schooling
you
can
make
yourself
as
truly
respectable
as
any
white
man
henry
he
said
hesitatingly
as
if
he
thought
the
result
hardly
worth
the
trouble
for
which
opinion
i
hardly
blame
him
considering
the
nature
of
a
great
many
white
men
of
this
country
it
am
right
hard
work
cap
here
he
chuckled
causelessly
and
i
thinks
i
like
to
come
and
do
chores
for
you
cap
no
i
remonstrated
think
of
giving
up
your
respectable
and
profitable
industry
i
could
afford
to
pay
you
more
than
ten
dollars
a
month
here
he
laughed
in
his
obstropolous
and
irrational
fashion
signifying
thereby
i
think
that
he
was
embarrassed
by
my
arguments
well
i
kinder
likes
dem
terms
he
said
like
i
wants
to
have
a
good
time
to
have
a
heap
o
money
and
so
here
he
is
with
me
having
a
good
time
and
getting
more
money
than
he
deserves
now
when
you
have
freed
with
your
own
right
hand
as
many
of
these
lazy
bumpkins
as
i
have
you
will
feel
at
liberty
to
speak
of
them
with
the
same
disrespectful
levity
wendell
phillips
says
that
the
negro
is
the
only
man
in
america
who
can
afford
to
fold
his
arms
and
quietly
await
his
future
that
is
just
what
the
critter
is
doing
and
just
what
puts
me
out
of
patience
with
him
moreover
he
ca
afford
it
if
he
does
fall
to
work
pretty
soon
we
shall
cease
to
be
negrophilists
we
shall
kick
him
out
of
doors
and
get
in
somebody
who
is
not
satisfied
with
folding
his
arms
and
waiting
his
future
he
is
too
impatient
said
the
doctor
after
he
had
finished
reading
the
letter
to
lillie
just
like
all
young
people
and
some
old
ones
god
has
chosen
to
allow
himself
a
hundred
years
to
free
the
negro
we
must
not
grumble
if
he
chooses
to
use
up
a
hundred
more
in
civilizing
him
i
can
answer
that
letter
to
my
own
satisfaction
what
right
has
captain
colburne
to
demand
roses
or
potatoes
of
land
which
has
been
sown
for
centuries
with
nothing
but
thistles
we
ought
to
be
thankful
if
it
merely
lies
barren
for
a
while
chapter
xx
captain
colburne
marches
and
fights
with
credit
the
consideration
of
colburne
letter
induces
me
to
take
up
once
more
the
thread
of
that
young
warrior
history
in
the
early
part
of
this
month
of
may
we
find
him
with
his
company
regiment
and
brigade
encamped
on
the
bank
of
the
red
river
just
outside
of
the
once
flourishing
little
city
of
alexandria
louisiana
under
the
protection
of
a
clapboard
shanty
five
feet
broad
and
ten
feet
high
which
three
or
four
of
his
men
have
voluntarily
built
for
him
he
is
lying
at
full
length
smoking
his
short
wooden
pipe
with
a
sense
of
luxury
for
since
he
left
his
tent
at
brashear
city
four
weeks
previous
this
is
the
first
shelter
which
he
has
had
to
protect
him
from
the
rain
except
one
or
two
ticklish
mansions
of
rails
piled
up
by
henry
of
the
obstropolous
laughter
the
brigade
encampment
a
mushroom
city
which
has
sprung
up
in
a
day
presenting
every
imaginable
variety
of
temporary
cabin
reaches
half
a
mile
up
and
down
the
river
under
the
shade
of
a
long
stretch
of
ashes
and
beeches
hundreds
of
soldiers
are
bathing
in
the
current
regardless
of
the
possibility
that
the
thick
woods
of
the
opposite
bank
may
conceal
rebel
marksmen
colburne
has
eaten
his
dinner
of
fried
pork
and
hardtack
has
washed
off
the
grime
of
a
three
days
march
has
finished
his
pipe
and
is
now
dropping
gently
into
a
soldier
yet
light
slumber
he
does
not
mind
the
babble
of
voices
about
him
but
if
you
should
say
fall
in
he
would
be
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
he
is
a
handsome
model
of
a
warrior
as
he
lies
there
though
rougher
and
plainer
in
dress
than
a
painter
would
be
apt
to
make
him
he
is
with
sunburn
gaunt
with
bad
food
irregular
food
fasting
and
severe
marching
gaunt
and
wiry
but
all
the
hardier
and
stronger
for
it
like
a
wolf
his
coarse
fatigue
uniform
is
dirty
with
sleeping
on
the
ground
and
with
marching
through
mud
and
clouds
of
dust
it
has
been
soaked
over
and
over
again
with
rain
or
perspiration
and
then
powdered
thickly
with
the
unctuous
soil
of
louisiana
until
it
is
almost
stiff
enough
to
stand
alone
he
can
not
wash
it
because
it
is
the
only
suit
he
has
brought
with
him
and
because
moreover
he
never
knows
but
that
he
may
be
ordered
to
fall
in
and
march
at
five
minutes
notice
yet
his
body
and
even
his
mind
are
in
the
soundest
and
most
enviable
health
his
constant
labors
and
hardships
and
his
occasional
perils
have
preserved
him
from
that
enfeebling
melancholy
which
often
infects
sensitive
spirits
upon
whom
has
beaten
a
storm
of
trouble
always
in
the
open
air
never
poisoned
by
the
neighborhood
of
four
walls
and
a
roof
he
never
catches
cold
and
rarely
fails
to
have
more
appetite
than
food
he
has
borne
as
well
as
the
hardiest
mason
or
farmer
those
terrific
forced
marches
which
have
brought
the
army
from
camp
beasland
to
alexandria
on
a
hot
scent
after
the
flying
and
scattering
rebels
his
feet
have
been
as
sore
as
any
man
they
have
been
blistered
from
toe
to
heel
and
swollen
beyond
their
natural
size
but
he
has
never
yet
laid
down
by
the
roadside
nor
crawled
into
an
army
wagon
saying
that
he
could
march
no
further
he
is
loyal
and
manly
in
his
endurance
and
is
justly
proud
of
it
in
one
of
his
letters
he
says
i
was
fully
repaid
for
yesterday
stretch
of
miles
by
overhearing
one
of
my
irishmen
say
while
washing
his
bloody
feet
but
he
a
hardy
man
the
captin
to
which
another
responded
he
had
his
hands
full
to
kape
the
byes
courage
up
along
in
the
afthernoon
he
was
a
jokin
an
scoldin
an
encouragin
for
ten
miles
together
be
an
when
gives
out
it
be
for
good
rayson
from
alexandria
banks
suddenly
shifted
his
army
to
the
junction
of
the
red
river
with
the
mississippi
and
from
thence
by
transport
to
a
point
north
of
port
hudson
thus
cutting
it
off
from
communication
with
the
confederacy
in
this
movement
weitzel
took
command
of
the
reserve
brigade
and
covered
the
rear
of
the
column
by
night
it
made
prodigious
marches
and
by
day
lay
in
threatening
line
of
battle
the
rebel
cavalry
timid
and
puzzled
followed
at
a
safe
distance
without
attacking
now
came
the
delicious
sail
from
simmsport
to
bayou
sara
during
which
colburne
could
lounge
at
ease
on
the
deck
with
a
sense
of
luxury
in
the
mere
consciousness
that
he
was
not
marching
and
repose
his
mind
his
eyes
his
very
muscles
by
gazing
on
the
fresh
green
bluffs
which
faced
each
other
across
the
river
to
a
native
of
hilly
new
england
who
had
passed
above
a
year
on
the
flats
of
louisiana
it
was
delightful
to
look
once
more
upon
a
rolling
country
it
was
through
an
atmosphere
of
scalding
heat
and
stifling
dust
that
the
brigade
marched
up
the
bluffs
of
bayou
sara
and
over
the
rounded
eminences
which
stretched
on
to
port
hudson
the
perspiration
which
drenched
the
ragged
uniforms
and
the
pulverous
soil
which
powdered
them
rapidly
mixed
into
a
muddy
plaster
and
the
same
plaster
grimed
the
men
faces
out
of
almost
all
semblance
to
humanity
except
where
the
dust
clung
dry
and
gray
to
hair
beard
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
so
dense
was
the
distressing
cloud
that
it
was
impossible
at
times
to
see
the
length
of
a
company
it
seemed
as
if
the
men
would
go
rabid
with
thirst
and
drive
the
officers
mad
with
their
pleadings
to
leave
the
ranks
for
water
a
privilege
not
allowable
to
any
great
extent
in
an
enemy
country
a
lovely
crystal
streamlet
running
over
clean
yellow
sand
a
charming
contrast
to
black
or
brown
bayous
with
muddy
and
treacherous
banks
was
forded
by
the
feverish
ranks
with
shouts
and
laughter
of
enjoyment
but
it
was
through
volumes
of
burning
yet
lazy
dust
soiling
and
darkening
the
glory
of
sunset
that
the
brigade
reached
its
appointed
bivouac
in
a
large
clearing
only
two
miles
from
the
rebel
stronghold
though
hidden
from
it
by
a
dense
forest
of
oaks
beeches
and
magnolias
it
is
too
early
to
tell
it
is
even
too
early
to
know
the
whole
truth
concerning
the
siege
of
port
hudson
to
an
honest
man
anxious
that
the
world
shall
not
be
humbugged
it
is
a
mournful
reflection
that
perhaps
the
whole
truth
never
will
be
known
to
any
one
who
will
dare
or
care
to
tell
it
we
gained
a
victory
there
we
took
an
important
step
towards
the
end
of
the
rebellion
but
at
what
cost
through
what
means
and
by
whose
merit
it
was
a
capital
idea
whosesoever
it
was
to
clean
out
taylor
texans
and
louisianians
from
the
teche
country
before
we
undertook
the
siege
of
gardner
arkansians
alabamians
and
mississippians
at
port
hudson
but
for
somebody
blunder
at
that
locality
irish
bend
the
plan
would
have
succeeded
better
than
it
did
and
taylor
would
not
have
been
able
to
reorganize
take
brashear
city
threaten
new
orleans
and
come
near
driving
banks
from
his
main
enterprise
as
it
was
we
opened
the
siege
with
fair
prospects
of
success
and
no
disturbing
force
in
the
rear
the
garrison
lately
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
strong
had
been
reduced
to
six
thousand
in
order
to
reinforce
vicksburg
and
joe
johnston
had
already
directed
gardner
to
destroy
his
fortifications
and
transfer
all
his
men
to
the
great
scene
of
contest
on
the
central
mississippi
banks
arrived
from
simmsport
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
execution
of
this
order
a
smart
skirmish
was
fought
in
which
we
lost
more
men
than
the
enemy
but
forced
gardner
to
retire
within
his
works
and
accept
the
eventualities
of
an
investment
at
five
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
colburne
was
awakened
by
an
order
to
fall
in
whether
it
signified
an
advance
on
our
part
or
a
sally
by
the
enemy
he
did
not
know
nor
ask
but
with
a
indifference
proceeded
to
form
his
company
and
that
done
ate
his
breakfast
of
raw
pork
and
hard
biscuit
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
henry
boil
him
a
cup
of
coffee
but
that
idle
freedman
was
having
a
good
time
probably
sleeping
in
some
unknown
refuge
for
two
hours
the
ranks
sat
on
the
ground
musket
in
hand
then
colburne
saw
the
foremost
line
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
front
advance
into
the
forest
one
of
weitzel
aids
now
dashed
up
to
carter
and
immediately
his
galloped
away
to
the
different
commanders
of
regiments
an
admonishing
murmur
of
fall
in
men
attention
men
from
the
captains
ran
along
the
line
of
the
tenth
and
the
soldiers
rose
in
their
places
to
meet
the
grand
the
awful
possibility
of
battle
it
was
a
long
row
of
stern
faces
bronzed
with
sunburn
sallow
in
many
cases
with
malaria
grave
with
the
serious
emotions
of
the
hour
but
hardened
by
the
habit
of
danger
and
set
as
firm
as
flints
toward
the
enemy
the
old
innocence
of
the
peaceable
new
england
farmer
and
mechanic
had
disappeared
from
these
visages
and
had
been
succeeded
by
an
expression
of
hardened
combativeness
not
a
little
brutal
much
like
the
look
of
a
lazy
colburne
smiled
with
pleasure
and
pride
as
he
glanced
along
the
line
of
his
company
and
noted
this
change
in
its
physiognomy
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
drawn
up
there
they
were
better
men
than
when
he
first
knew
them
and
as
good
men
as
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
at
last
the
voice
rang
out
battalion
forward
guide
right
march
to
keep
the
ranks
closed
and
aligned
in
any
tolerable
fighting
shape
while
struggling
through
that
mile
of
tangled
forest
and
broken
ground
was
a
task
of
terrible
difficulty
plunging
through
thickets
leaping
over
fallen
trees
a
continuous
foliage
overhead
and
the
fallen
leaves
of
many
seasons
under
foot
the
air
full
of
the
damp
mouldering
smell
of
virgin
forest
the
brigade
moved
forward
with
no
sound
but
that
of
its
own
tramplings
it
is
peculiar
of
the
american
attack
that
it
is
almost
always
made
in
line
and
always
without
music
the
men
expected
to
meet
the
enemy
at
every
hillock
but
they
advanced
rapidly
and
laughed
at
each
other
slippings
and
tumbles
every
body
was
breathless
with
climbing
over
obstacles
or
running
around
them
the
officers
were
beginning
to
swear
at
the
broken
ranks
and
unsteady
pace
the
perceiving
that
the
regiment
was
diverging
from
its
comrades
and
fearing
the
consequences
of
a
gap
in
case
the
enemy
should
suddenly
open
fire
rode
repeatedly
up
and
down
the
line
yelling
guide
right
close
up
to
the
right
suddenly
to
the
amazement
of
every
one
the
brigade
came
upon
bivouacs
of
union
regiments
quietly
engaged
in
distributing
rations
and
preparing
breakfast
what
are
you
doing
up
here
asked
a
major
of
colburne
we
are
going
to
attack
do
you
take
part
in
it
i
suppose
so
i
do
know
we
have
received
no
orders
through
this
scene
of
tardiness
the
result
perhaps
of
one
of
those
blunders
which
are
known
in
military
as
well
as
in
all
other
human
operations
weitzel
division
steadily
advanced
much
wondering
if
it
was
to
storm
port
hudson
alone
the
ground
soon
proved
so
difficult
that
the
tenth
unable
to
move
in
line
of
battle
filed
into
a
faintly
marked
forest
road
and
pushed
forward
by
the
flank
in
the
ordinary
column
of
march
the
battle
had
already
commenced
although
colburne
could
see
nothing
of
it
and
could
hear
nothing
but
a
dull
of
cannon
he
passed
rude
made
of
earth
and
large
branches
which
had
been
carried
only
a
few
minutes
previous
by
the
confused
rush
of
the
leading
brigade
away
to
the
right
but
not
near
enough
to
be
heard
above
the
roar
of
artillery
there
was
a
wild
scattering
musketry
of
broken
lines
fighting
and
scrambling
along
as
they
best
could
over
thicketed
knolls
and
through
rugged
gullies
on
the
track
of
the
retiring
alabamians
and
arkansans
it
was
the
blindest
and
most
perplexing
forest
labyrinth
conceivable
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whither
you
were
going
or
whether
you
would
stumble
on
friends
or
enemies
the
regiments
were
split
into
little
squads
from
which
all
order
had
disappeared
but
which
nevertheless
advanced
the
tenth
was
still
marching
through
the
woods
by
the
flank
unable
to
see
either
fortifications
or
enemy
when
it
came
under
the
fire
of
artillery
and
encountered
the
retiring
stream
of
wounded
at
this
moment
and
for
two
hours
afterward
the
uproar
of
heavy
guns
bursting
shells
falling
trees
and
flying
splinters
was
astonishing
stunning
horrible
doubled
as
it
was
by
the
sonorous
echoes
of
the
forest
magnolias
oaks
and
beeches
eighteen
inches
or
two
feet
in
diameter
were
cut
asunder
with
a
deafening
scream
of
shot
and
of
splitting
fibres
the
tops
falling
after
a
pause
of
majestic
deliberation
not
sidewise
but
stem
downwards
like
a
descending
parachute
and
striking
the
earth
with
a
dull
shuddering
thunder
they
seemed
to
give
up
their
life
with
a
roar
of
animate
anguish
as
if
they
were
savage
beasts
or
as
if
they
were
inhabited
by
afreets
and
demons
the
unusually
horrible
clamor
and
the
nature
of
the
danger
had
an
evident
effect
on
the
soldiers
hardened
as
they
were
to
scenes
of
ordinary
battle
grim
faces
turned
in
every
direction
with
hasty
stares
of
alarm
looking
aloft
and
on
every
side
as
well
as
to
the
front
for
destruction
pallid
stragglers
who
had
dropped
out
of
the
leading
brigade
drifted
by
the
tenth
dodging
from
trunk
to
trunk
in
an
instinctive
search
for
cover
although
it
was
visible
that
the
forest
was
no
protection
but
rather
an
additional
peril
every
regiment
has
its
two
or
three
cowards
or
perhaps
its
creatures
whom
nothing
can
make
fight
and
who
never
do
fight
one
abject
hound
a
corporal
with
his
disgraced
stripes
upon
his
arm
came
by
with
a
ghastly
backward
glare
of
horror
his
face
colorless
his
eyes
projecting
and
his
chin
shaking
colburne
cursed
him
for
a
poltroon
struck
him
with
the
flat
of
his
sabre
and
dragged
him
into
the
ranks
of
his
own
regiment
but
the
miserable
creature
was
too
thoroughly
unmanned
by
the
great
horror
of
death
to
be
moved
to
any
show
of
resentment
or
even
of
courage
by
the
indignity
he
only
gave
an
idiotic
stare
with
outstretched
neck
toward
the
front
then
turned
with
a
nervous
jerk
like
that
of
a
scared
beast
and
rushed
rearward
further
on
six
men
were
standing
in
single
file
behind
a
large
beech
holding
each
other
by
the
shoulders
when
with
a
stunning
crash
the
entire
top
of
the
tree
flew
off
and
came
down
among
them
butt
foremost
sending
out
a
cloud
of
dust
and
splinters
colburne
smiled
grimly
to
see
the
paralyzed
terror
of
their
upward
stare
and
the
frantic
flight
which
barely
saved
them
from
being
crushed
jelly
a
man
who
keeps
the
ranks
hates
a
skulker
and
wishes
that
he
may
be
killed
the
same
as
any
other
enemy
but
in
truth
says
the
captain
in
one
of
his
letters
the
sights
and
sounds
of
this
forest
were
enough
to
shake
the
firmest
nerves
never
before
had
i
been
so
tried
as
i
was
during
that
hour
in
this
wilderness
of
death
it
was
not
the
slaughter
which
unmanned
me
for
our
regiment
did
not
lose
very
heavily
it
was
the
stupendous
clamor
of
the
cannonade
and
of
the
crashing
trees
which
seemed
to
overwhelm
me
by
its
mere
physical
power
and
it
made
me
unable
to
bear
spectacles
which
i
had
witnessed
in
other
engagements
with
perfect
composure
when
one
of
our
men
was
borne
by
me
with
half
his
foot
torn
off
by
a
round
shot
the
splintered
bones
projecting
clean
and
white
from
the
ragged
raw
flesh
i
grew
so
sick
that
perhaps
i
might
have
fainted
if
a
brother
officer
had
not
given
me
a
sip
of
whiskey
from
his
canteen
it
was
the
only
occasion
in
my
fighting
experience
when
i
have
had
to
resort
to
that
support
i
had
scarcely
recovered
myself
when
i
saw
a
broad
flow
of
blood
stream
down
the
face
of
a
who
stood
within
of
me
i
thought
he
was
surely
a
dead
man
but
it
was
only
one
of
the
wonderful
escapes
of
battle
the
bullet
had
skirted
his
cap
where
the
joins
the
cloth
forcing
the
edge
of
the
leather
through
the
skin
and
making
a
clean
cut
to
the
bone
from
temple
to
temple
he
went
to
the
rear
blinded
and
with
a
smart
headache
but
not
seriously
injured
that
we
were
not
slaughtered
by
the
wholesale
is
wonderful
for
we
were
closed
up
in
a
compact
mass
and
the
shot
came
with
stunning
rapidity
a
shell
burst
in
the
centre
of
my
company
tearing
one
man
heel
to
the
bone
but
doing
no
other
damage
the
wounded
man
a
good
soldier
though
as
quiet
and
gentle
as
a
bashful
girl
touched
his
hat
to
me
showed
his
bleeding
foot
and
asked
leave
to
go
to
the
rear
which
i
of
course
granted
while
he
was
speaking
another
shell
burst
about
six
feet
from
the
first
doing
no
harm
at
all
although
so
near
to
van
zandt
as
to
dazzle
and
deafen
him
presently
a
section
of
bainbridge
regular
battery
came
up
winding
slowly
through
the
forest
the
guns
thumping
over
roots
and
fallen
limbs
the
men
sitting
superbly
erect
on
their
horses
and
the
holding
his
as
proudly
as
a
ever
bore
his
pennon
in
a
minute
the
two
brass
napoleons
opened
with
a
sonorous
which
drew
a
spontaneous
cheer
from
the
delighted
infantry
the
edge
of
the
wood
was
now
reached
and
colburne
could
see
the
enemy
position
in
front
of
him
lay
a
broad
and
curving
valley
irregular
in
surface
and
seamed
in
some
places
by
rugged
gorges
the
whole
made
more
difficult
of
passage
by
a
multitude
of
felled
trees
the
leafless
trunks
and
branches
of
which
were
tangled
into
an
inextricable
de
on
the
other
side
of
this
valley
rose
a
bluff
or
partially
covered
with
forest
but
showing
on
its
cleared
spaces
the
tents
and
cabins
of
the
rebel
encampments
along
the
edge
of
the
bluff
following
its
sinuosities
and
at
this
distance
looking
like
mere
natural
banks
of
yellow
earth
ran
the
fortifications
of
port
hudson
colburne
could
see
paine
brigade
of
weitzel
division
descending
into
the
valley
forcing
its
bloody
way
through
a
roaring
cannonade
and
a
continuous
screech
of
musketry
an
order
came
to
the
commander
of
the
tenth
to
deploy
two
companies
as
skirmishers
in
the
hollow
in
front
of
bainbridge
and
push
to
the
left
with
the
remainder
of
the
regiment
throwing
out
other
skirmishers
and
silencing
the
rebel
artillery
one
of
the
two
detached
companies
was
colburne
and
he
took
command
of
both
as
senior
officer
at
the
moment
that
he
filed
his
men
out
of
the
line
a
murmur
ran
through
the
regiment
that
the
was
killed
or
badly
wounded
then
came
an
inquiry
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
major
by
jove
it
would
be
a
dangerous
job
to
hunt
for
him
chuckled
van
zandt
why
where
is
he
asked
colburne
i
do
believe
by
jove
that
i
could
say
within
a
mile
or
two
i
only
know
by
jove
that
he
is
est
i
saw
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
charging
for
the
rear
with
his
usual
impetuosity
i
bet
my
everlasting
salvation
that
he
in
the
safest
spot
within
ten
miles
of
this
d
d
unhealthy
neighborhood
the
senior
captain
took
command
of
the
regiment
and
led
it
to
the
left
on
a
line
parallel
with
the
fortifications
colburne
descended
with
his
little
detachment
numbering
about
eighty
muskets
into
that
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
climbing
over
or
creeping
under
the
fallen
trunks
of
the
tangled
labyrinth
and
making
straight
for
the
bluff
on
which
thundered
and
smoked
the
rebel
stronghold
as
his
men
advanced
they
deployed
spreading
outwards
like
the
diverging
blades
of
a
fan
until
they
covered
a
front
of
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
every
stump
every
prostrate
trunk
every
knoll
and
gulley
was
a
temporary
breastwork
from
behind
which
they
poured
a
slow
but
fatal
fire
upon
the
rebel
gunners
who
could
be
plainly
seen
upon
the
hostile
parapet
working
their
pieces
the
officers
and
sergeants
moved
up
and
down
the
line
each
behind
his
own
platoon
or
section
steadily
urging
it
forward
move
on

move
on

colburne
repeated
do
expose
yourselves
use
the
covers
use
the
stumps
but
keep
moving
on
take
root
do
stop
till
we
reach
the
ditch
in
spite
of
their
intelligent
prudence
the
men
were
falling
under
the
incessant
flight
of
bullets
a
loud
scream
from
a
thicket
a
little
to
colburne
right
attracted
his
attention
who
is
that
he
called
it
is

replied
a
sergeant
he
is
shot
through
the
body
shall
i
send
him
to
the
rear
not
now
wait
till
we
are
relieved
prop
him
up
and
leave
him
in
the
shade
he
had
in
his
mind
this
passage
of
the
army
regulations
soldiers
must
not
be
permitted
to
leave
the
ranks
to
strip
or
rob
the
dead
nor
even
to
assist
the
wounded
unless
by
express
permission
which
is
only
to
be
given
after
the
action
is
decided
the
highest
interest
and
most
pressing
duty
is
to
win
the
victory
by
which
only
can
a
proper
care
of
the
wounded
be
ensured
turning
to
a
soldier
who
had
mounted
a
log
and
stood
up
at
the
full
height
of
his
six
feet
to
survey
the
fortifications
colburne
shouted
jump
down
you
fool
you
will
get
yourself
hit
for
nothing
captain
i
ca
see
a
chance
for
a
shot
replied
the
fellow
deliberately
get
down
reiterated
colburne
but
the
man
had
waited
too
long
already
throwing
up
both
hands
he
fell
backward
with
an
incoherent
gurgle
pierced
through
the
lungs
by
a
then
a
little
irish
soldier
burst
out
swearing
and
hastily
pulled
his
trousers
to
glare
at
a
through
the
calf
of
his
leg
with
a
comical
expression
of
mingled
surprise
alarm
and
wrath
and
so
it
went
on
every
few
minutes
there
was
an
oath
of
rage
or
a
shriek
of
pain
and
each
outcry
marked
the
loss
of
a
man
but
all
the
while
the
line
of
skirmishers
advanced
the
sickishness
which
troubled
colburne
in
the
forest
had
gone
and
was
succeeded
by
the
fierce
excitement
of
close
battle
where
the
combatants
grow
angry
and
savage
at
sight
of
each
other
faces
he
was
throbbing
with
elation
and
confidence
for
he
had
cleaned
off
the
gunners
from
the
two
pieces
in
his
front
he
felt
as
if
he
could
take
port
hudson
with
his
detachment
alone
the
contest
was
raging
in
a
clamorous
rattle
of
musketry
on
the
right
where
paine
brigade
and
four
regiments
of
the
reserve
brigade
all
broken
into
detachments
by
gullies
hillocks
thickets
and
fallen
trees
were
struggling
to
turn
and
force
the
fortifications
on
his
left
other
companies
of
the
tenth
were
slowly
moving
forward
deployed
and
firing
as
skirmishers
in
his
front
the
rebel
musketry
gradually
slackened
and
only
now
and
then
could
he
see
a
hat
show
above
the
and
hear
the
hoarse
whistle
of
a
as
it
passed
him
the
garrison
on
this
side
was
clearly
both
few
in
number
and
disheartened
it
seemed
to
him
likely
yes
even
certain
that
port
hudson
would
be
carried
by
storm
that
morning
at
the
same
time
half
mad
as
he
was
with
the
glorious
intoxication
of
successful
battle
he
knew
that
it
would
be
utter
folly
to
push
his
unsupported
detachment
into
the
works
and
that
such
a
movement
would
probably
end
in
slaughter
or
capture
fifteen
or
twenty
he
did
not
know
precisely
how
many
of
his
soldiers
had
been
hit
and
the
survivors
were
getting
short
of
cartridges
steady
men
he
shouted
halt
take
cover
and
hold
your
position
do
waste
your
powder
fire
slow
and
aim
sure
the
orders
were
echoed
from
man
to
man
along
the
extended
straggling
line
and
each
one
disappeared
behind
the
nearest
thicket
stump
or
fallen
tree
colburne
had
already
sent
three
corporals
to
the
regiment
to
recount
his
success
and
beg
for
more
men
but
neither
had
the
messengers
reappeared
nor
reinforcements
arrived
to
support
his
proposed
assault
those
fellows
must
have
got
themselves
shot
he
said
to
van
zandt
i
go
myself
keep
the
line
where
it
is
and
save
the
cartridges
taking
a
single
soldier
with
him
he
hurried
rearward
by
the
clearest
course
that
he
could
find
through
the
prostrate
forest
without
minding
the
few
bullets
that
whizzed
by
him
suddenly
he
halted
powerless
as
if
struck
by
paralysis
conscious
of
a
general
nervous
shock
and
a
sharp
pain
in
his
left
arm
his
first
impulse
a
very
hurried
impulse
was
to
take
the
arm
with
his
right
hand
and
twist
it
to
see
if
the
bone
was
broken
next
he
looked
about
him
for
some
shelter
from
the
scorching
and
crazing
sunshine
he
espied
a
green
bush
and
almost
immediately
lost
sight
of
it
for
the
shock
made
him
faint
although
the
pain
was
but
momentary
are
you
hurt
captain
asked
the
soldier
take
me
to
that
bush
said
colburne
pointing
for
he
knew
where
the
cover
was
although
he
could
not
see
it
the
soldier
put
an
arm
round
his
waist
led
him
to
the
bush
and
laid
him
down
shall
i
go
for
help
captain
no
do
weaken
the
company
all
right
no
bones
broken
go
on
in
a
minute
the
man
tied
his
handkerchief
about
the
ragged
and
bloody
hole
in
the
then
sat
down
and
reloaded
his
musket
occasionally
casting
a
glance
at
the
pale
face
of
the
captain
in
two
or
three
minutes
colburne
color
came
back
and
he
felt
as
well
as
ever
he
rose
carefully
to
his
feet
looked
about
him
as
if
to
see
where
he
was
and
again
set
off
for
the
regiment
followed
by
his
silent
companion
the
bullets
still
whizzed
about
them
but
did
no
harm
after
a
slow
walk
of
ten
minutes
during
which
colburne
once
stopped
to
sling
his
arm
in
a
handkerchief
he
emerged
from
a
winding
gully
to
find
himself
within
a
few
yards
of
bainbridge
battery
behind
the
guns
was
a
colonel
calmly
sitting
his
horse
and
watching
the
battle
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
colonel
a
flesh
wound
said
colburne
colonel
there
is
a
noble
chance
ahead
of
you
do
you
see
that
angle
my
men
are
at
the
base
of
it
and
some
of
them
in
the
ditch
they
have
driven
the
artillerymen
from
the
guns
and
forced
the
infantry
to
lie
low
for
god
sake
send
in
your
regiment
we
can
certainly
carry
the
place
the
entire
brigade
that
i
command
is
engaged
replied
the
colonel
do
you
see
them
on
the
right
of
your
position
is
there
no
other
force
about
here
asked
colburne
sitting
down
as
he
felt
the
dizziness
coming
over
him
again
none
that
i
know
of
this
is
such
an
infernal
country
for
movements
that
we
are
all
dislocated
nobody
knows
where
anything
but
you
had
better
go
to
the
rear
captain
you
look
used
up
colburne
was
so
tired
so
weak
with
the
loss
of
blood
so
worn
out
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
excitement
of
fighting
that
he
could
not
help
feeling
discouraged
at
the
thought
of
struggling
back
to
the
position
of
his
company
he
stretched
himself
under
a
tree
to
rest
and
in
ten
minutes
was
fast
asleep
when
he
awoke
he
never
knew
how
long
afterwards
he
could
not
at
first
tell
what
he
remembered
from
what
he
had
dreamed
and
only
satisfied
himself
that
he
had
been
hit
by
looking
at
his
bloody
and
bandaged
arm
an
artilleryman
brought
him
to
his
full
consciousness
by
shouting
excitedly
there
by
god
they
are
trying
a
charge
the
infantry
are
trying
a
charge
colburne
rose
up
saw
a
regiment
struggling
across
the
valley
and
heard
its
charging
yell
i
must
go
back
he
exclaimed
my
men
ought
to
go
in
and
support
those
fellows
turning
to
the
soldier
who
attended
him
he
added
run
tell
van
zandt
to
forward
the
soldier
ran
and
colburne
after
him
but
he
had
not
gone
twenty
paces
before
he
fell
straight
forward
on
his
face
without
a
word
and
lay
perfectly
still
chapter
xxi
captain
colburne
has
occasion
to
see
life
in
a
hospital
when
colburne
came
to
himself
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
in
rear
of
the
pieces
beside
him
in
the
shadow
of
the
same
tuft
of
withering
bushes
lay
a
wounded
lieutenant
of
the
battery
and
four
wounded
artillerists
a
dozen
steps
away
rapidly
blackening
in
the
scorching
sun
and
sweltering
air
were
two
more
artillerists
stark
dead
one
with
his
brains
bulging
from
a
in
his
forehead
while
a
dark
streak
crossed
his
face
the
other
trousers
soaked
with
a
dirty
carnation
stain
of
drawn
from
the
femoral
artery
none
of
the
wounded
men
writhed
or
groaned
or
pleaded
for
succor
although
a
sweat
of
suffering
stood
in
great
drops
on
their
faces
each
had
cried
out
when
he
was
hit
uttering
either
an
oath
or
the
simple
exclamation
oh
in
a
tone
of
dolorous
surprise
one
had
shrieked
spasmodically
physically
crazed
by
the
shock
administered
to
some
important
nervous
centre
but
all
sooner
or
later
had
settled
into
the
calm
sublime
patience
of
the
wounded
of
the
the
brass
napoleons
were
still
spanging
sonorously
and
there
was
a
ceaseless
spitting
of
irregular
musketry
in
the
distance
did
the
assault
succeed
asked
colburne
as
soon
as
he
had
got
his
wits
about
him
no
sir
it
was
beat
off
said
one
of
the
wounded
artillerists
you
had
a
faint
sir
he
added
with
a
smile
that
was
a
smart
tumble
you
got
we
saw
you
go
over
and
brought
you
back
here
i
am
very
much
obliged
replied
colburne
his
arm
pained
him
now
his
head
ached
frightfully
his
whole
frame
was
feverish
and
he
thought
of
new
england
brooks
of
cool
water
in
a
few
minutes
lieutenant
van
zandt
appeared
his
dark
face
a
little
paler
than
usual
and
the
right
shoulder
of
his
blouse
pierced
with
a
ragged
and
bloody
well
captain
said
he
we
have
got
by
jove
our
allowance
of
rations
had
we
better
look
up
a
doctor
shop
i
feel
by
the
everlasting
jove
excuse
me
that
i
stand
in
need
of
a
sup
of
whiskey
lieutenant
i
beg
your
pardon
i
see
you
are
wounded
i
hope
you
not
much
hurt
sir
but
have
you
a
drop
of
the
article
about
the
battery
no
by
jupiter
you
go
into
action
mighty
short
of
ammunition
i
beg
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
this
is
by
jove
the
dryest
fighting
that
i
ever
saw
i
wish
i
was
in
mexico
and
had
a
gourd
of
aguardiente
by
the
way
i
wish
the
reader
to
understand
that
when
i
introduce
a
by
jove
into
van
zandt
conversation
it
is
to
be
understood
that
that
very
remarkably
profane
officer
and
gentleman
used
the
great
name
of
the
true
divinity
where
is
the
company
lieutenant
asked
colburne
relieved
sir
both
companies
were
relieved
and
ordered
back
to
the
regiment
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
ago
i
got
this
welt
in
the
shoulder
just
as
i
was
coming
out
of
that
damned
hollow
we
may
as
well
go
along
sir
our
day
fight
is
over
so
the
attack
failed
said
colburne
as
they
took
up
their
slow
march
to
the
rear
in
search
of
a
field
hospital
broken
up
by
the
ground
sir
beaten
off
by
the
musketry
could
put
more
than
a
man
or
two
on
the
ramparts
played
out
before
it
got
any
where
just
like
a
wave
coming
up
a
sandy
beach
it
was
only
a
regiment
it
ought
to
have
been
a
brigade
but
a
regiment
might
have
done
it
if
it
had
been
shoved
in
earlier
that
was
the
time
sir
when
you
went
off
for
reinforcements
if
we
had
had
the
bully
old
tenth
there
then
we
could
have
taken
port
hudson
alone
just
after
you
left
the
rebs
raised
the
white
flag
and
a
whole
battalion
of
them
came
out
on
our
right
and
stacked
arms
some
of
our
men
spoke
to
them
and
asked
what
they
were
after
they
said
by
jove
it
so
sir
they
said
they
had
surrendered
then
down
came
some
rebel
general
or
other
in
a
tearing
rage
and
marched
them
back
behind
the
works
the
charge
came
too
late
they
beat
it
off
easy
they
took
the
starch
out
of
that
twelfth
maine
sir
i
have
seen
by
jove
the
value
of
minutes
before
they
had
got
out
of
range
of
the
rebel
musketry
they
came
upon
a
surgeon
attending
some
wounded
men
in
a
little
sheltered
hollow
he
offered
to
examine
their
hurts
and
proposed
to
give
them
chloroform
no
thank
you
said
colburne
you
have
your
hands
full
and
we
can
walk
farther
doctor
i
do
mind
taking
a
little
stimulant
observed
van
zandt
picking
up
a
small
flask
and
draining
it
nearly
to
the
bottom
your
good
health
sir
my
best
respects
a
quarter
of
a
mile
further
on
they
found
a
second
surgeon
similarly
occupied
from
whom
van
zandt
obtained
another
deep
draught
of
his
favorite
medicament
rejecting
chloroform
with
profane
politeness
colburne
refused
both
and
asked
for
water
but
could
obtain
none
deep
in
the
profound
and
solemn
woods
a
full
mile
and
a
half
from
the
fighting
line
they
came
to
the
field
hospital
of
the
division
it
was
simply
an
immense
collection
of
wounded
men
in
every
imaginable
condition
of
mutilation
every
one
stained
more
or
less
with
his
own
blood
every
one
of
a
ghastly
yellowish
pallor
all
lying
in
the
open
air
on
the
bare
ground
or
on
their
own
blankets
with
no
shelter
except
the
friendly
foliage
of
the
oaks
and
beeches
in
the
centre
of
this
mass
of
suffering
stood
several
operating
tables
each
burdened
by
a
grievously
wounded
man
and
surrounded
by
surgeons
and
their
assistants
underneath
were
great
pools
of
clotted
blood
amidst
which
lay
amputated
fingers
hands
arms
feet
and
legs
only
a
little
more
ghastly
in
color
than
the
faces
of
those
who
waited
their
turn
on
the
table
the
surgeons
who
never
ceased
their
awful
labor
were
daubed
with
blood
to
the
elbows
and
a
smell
of
blood
drenched
the
stifling
air
overpowering
even
the
pungent
odor
of
chloroform
the
place
resounded
with
groans
notwithstanding
that
most
of
the
injured
men
who
retained
their
senses
exhibited
the
heroic
endurance
so
common
on
the
one
man
whose
leg
was
amputated
close
to
his
body
uttered
an
inarticulate
jabber
of
broken
screams
and
rolled
or
rather
bounced
from
side
to
side
of
a
pile
of
loose
cotton
with
such
violence
that
two
hospital
attendants
were
fully
occupied
in
holding
him
another
shot
through
the
body
lay
speechless
and
dying
but
quivering
from
head
to
foot
with
a
prolonged
though
probably
unconscious
agony
he
continued
to
shudder
thus
for
half
an
hour
when
he
gave
one
superhuman
throe
and
then
lay
quiet
for
ever
an
irishman
a
gunner
of
a
regular
battery
showed
astonishing
vitality
and
a
fortitude
bordering
on
callousness
his
right
leg
had
been
knocked
off
above
the
knee
by
a
round
shot
the
stump
being
so
deadened
and
seared
by
the
shock
that
the
mere
bleeding
was
too
slight
to
be
mortal
he
lay
on
his
left
side
and
was
trying
to
get
his
left
hand
into
his
with
great
difficulty
and
grinning
with
pain
he
brought
forth
a
short
clay
pipe
blackened
by
previous
smoking
and
a
pinch
of
chopped
plug
tobacco
having
filled
the
pipe
carefully
and
deliberately
he
beckoned
a
negro
to
bring
him
a
coal
of
fire
lighted
and
commenced
puffing
with
an
air
of
tranquillity
which
resembled
comfort
yet
he
was
probably
mortally
wounded
human
nature
could
hardly
survive
such
a
hurt
in
such
a
season
nearly
all
the
leg
amputations
at
port
hudson
proved
fatal
the
men
whose
business
it
is
to
pick
up
the
wounded
the
musicians
and
quartermaster
people
were
constantly
bringing
in
fresh
sufferers
laying
them
on
the
ground
putting
a
or
havresack
under
their
heads
and
then
hurrying
away
for
other
burdens
of
misery
they
as
well
as
the
surgeons
and
hospital
attendants
already
looked
worn
out
with
the
fatigue
of
their
terrible
industry
come
up
and
see
them
butcher
captain
said
the
van
zandt
striding
over
prostrate
and
shrinking
forms
to
the
side
of
one
of
the
tables
and
glaring
at
the
process
of
an
amputation
with
an
eager
smile
of
interest
much
like
the
grin
of
a
who
watches
the
cutting
up
of
a
piece
of
beef
presently
he
espied
the
assistant
surgeon
of
the
tenth
and
made
an
immediate
rush
at
him
for
whiskey
bringing
the
flask
which
he
obtained
to
colburne
he
gave
him
a
sip
and
then
swallowed
the
rest
himself
by
this
time
he
began
to
show
signs
of
intoxication
he
laughed
told
stories
and
bellowed
humorous
comments
on
the
horrid
scene
colburne
left
him
moved
out
of
the
circle
of
anguish
seated
himself
on
the
ground
with
his
back
against
a
tree
filled
his
pipe
and
tried
to
while
away
the
time
in
smoking
he
was
weak
with
want
of
food
as
well
as
loss
of
blood
but
he
could
not
eat
a
bit
of
cracker
which
a
wounded
soldier
gave
him
once
he
tried
to
soothe
the
agony
of
his
whom
he
discovered
lying
on
a
pile
of
loose
cotton
with
a
in
his
thigh
which
the
surgeon
whispered
was
mortal
the
missile
having
glanced
up
into
his
body
it
a
lie
exclaimed
the
sufferer
it
all
nonsense
doctor
you
do
know
your
business
i
wo
die
i
die
it
all
nonsense
to
say
that
a
little
hole
in
the
leg
like
that
can
kill
a
great
strong
man
like
me
i
tell
you
i
and
wo
die
under
the
influence
of
the
shock
or
of
chloroform
his
mind
soon
began
to
wander
i
have
fought
well
he
muttered
i
am
not
a
coward
i
am
not
a
gazaway
i
have
never
disgraced
myself
i
call
all
my
regiment
to
witness
that
i
have
fought
like
a
man
summon
the
tenth
here
officers
and
men
summon
them
here
to
say
what
they
like
i
will
leave
it
to
any
officer
any
soldier
in
my
regiment
in
an
hour
more
he
was
a
corpse
and
before
night
he
was
black
with
putrefaction
so
rapid
was
that
shocking
change
under
the
heat
of
a
louisiana
may
amid
these
horrible
scenes
van
zandt
grew
momentarily
more
intoxicated
the
surgeons
could
hardly
keep
him
quiet
long
enough
to
dress
his
wound
so
anxious
was
he
to
stroll
about
and
search
for
more
whiskey
he
talked
laughed
and
swore
without
intermission
every
now
and
then
bellowing
like
a
bull
for
strong
liquors
from
table
to
table
from
sufferer
to
sufferer
he
followed
the
surgeon
of
the
tenth
slapping
him
on
the
back
violently
and
shouting
doctor
give
me
some
whiskey
give
you
a
rise
doctor
i
give
you
a
rise
higher
than
a
balloon
hand
over
your
whiskey
damn
you
if
he
had
not
been
so
horrible
he
would
have
been
ludicrous
his
herculean
form
was
in
incessant
stumbling
motion
and
his
dark
face
was
beaded
with
perspiration
a
perpetual
silly
leer
played
about
his
wide
mouth
and
his
eyes
stood
out
so
with
eagerness
that
the
white
showed
a
clear
circle
around
the
black
iris
he
offered
his
assistance
to
the
surgeons
boasted
of
his
education
as
a
graduate
of
columbia
college
declared
that
he
was
a
better
doctor
than
any
other
infernal
fool
present
made
himself
a
torment
to
the
helplessly
wounded
upon
a
major
of
a
louisiana
regiment
who
had
been
disabled
by
a
severe
contusion
he
poured
contempt
and
imprecations
what
are
you
lying
whimpering
there
for
he
shouted
it
nothing
but
a
little
bruise
a
child
by
jove
would
stop
playing
for
it
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
get
up
and
join
your
regiment
the
major
simply
laughed
being
a
hard
drinker
himself
and
having
a
brotherly
patience
with
drunkards
that
the
style
of
majors
pursued
van
zandt
are
blessed
by
jove
with
a
major
he
is
by
jove
a
dam
incur
dam
able
darn
coward
when
van
zandt
was
informed
the
next
day
of
this
feat
of
profanity
he
seemed
quite
gratified
and
remarked
that
by
jove
is
giving
a
word
a
full
battery
and
amidships
where
gazaway
in
a
roar
where
the
heroic
major
of
the
tenth
i
am
going
by
jove
to
look
him
up
i
am
going
by
jove
to
find
the
safest
place
in
the
whole
country
where
gazaway
is
there
is
peace
colburne
refused
one
or
two
offers
to
dress
his
wound
saying
that
others
needed
more
instant
care
than
himself
when
at
last
he
submitted
to
an
examination
it
was
found
that
the
ball
had
passed
between
the
bones
of
the
not
breaking
them
indeed
but
scaling
off
some
exterior
splinters
and
making
an
ugly
rent
in
the
muscles
i
do
think
you
lose
your
arm
said
the
surgeon
but
you
have
a
nasty
sore
for
a
month
or
two
i
dress
it
now
that
i
about
it
you
better
take
the
chloroform
it
will
make
it
easier
for
both
of
us
under
the
combined
influence
of
weakness
whiskey
and
chloroform
colburne
fell
asleep
after
the
operation
about
sundown
he
awoke
his
throat
so
parched
that
he
could
hardly
speak
his
skin
fiery
with
fever
and
his
whole
body
sore
nevertheless
he
joined
a
procession
of
slightly
wounded
men
and
marched
a
mile
to
a
general
hospital
which
had
been
set
up
in
and
around
a
planter
house
in
rear
of
the
forest
the
proprietor
and
his
son
were
in
the
garrison
of
port
hudson
but
the
wife
and
two
daughters
were
there
full
of
scorn
and
hatred
so
unwomanly
so
unimaginably
savage
in
conversation
and
soul
that
no
novelist
would
dare
to
invent
such
characters
nothing
but
real
life
could
justify
him
in
painting
them
they
seemed
to
be
actually
intoxicated
with
the
malignant
strength
of
a
malice
passionate
enough
to
dethrone
the
reason
of
any
being
not
aboriginally
brutal
they
laughed
like
demons
to
see
the
wounds
and
hear
the
groans
of
the
sufferers
they
jeered
them
because
the
assault
had
failed
the
yankees
never
could
take
port
hudson
they
were
the
meanest
the
most
dastardly
people
on
earth
joe
johnson
would
soon
kill
the
rest
of
them
and
have
banks
a
prisoner
and
shut
him
up
in
a
cage
i
hope
to
see
you
all
dead
laughed
one
of
these
female
hyenas
i
will
dance
with
joy
on
your
graves
my
brother
makes
beautiful
rings
out
of
yankee
bones
no
harm
was
done
to
them
nor
any
stress
of
silence
laid
upon
them
when
their
own
food
gave
out
they
were
fed
from
the
public
stores
and
at
the
end
of
the
siege
they
were
left
unmolested
to
gloat
in
their
jackal
fashion
over
patriot
graves
there
was
a
lack
of
hospital
accommodation
near
port
hudson
so
bare
is
the
land
of
dwellings
there
was
a
lack
of
surgeons
nurses
stores
and
especially
of
ice
that
absolute
necessity
of
surgery
in
our
southern
climate
and
therefore
the
wounded
were
sent
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
new
orleans
ambulances
were
few
at
that
time
in
the
department
of
the
gulf
and
colburne
found
the
heavy
springless
which
conveyed
him
to
springfield
landing
a
chariot
of
torture
his
arm
was
swollen
to
twice
its
natural
size
from
the
knuckles
to
the
elbow
nature
had
set
to
work
with
her
tormenting
remedies
of
inflammation
and
suppuration
to
extract
the
sharp
slivers
of
bone
which
still
hid
in
the
wound
notwithstanding
the
searching
finger
and
probe
of
the
surgeon
during
the
night
previous
to
this
journey
neither
whiskey
nor
opium
could
enable
him
to
sleep
and
he
could
only
escape
from
his
painful
by
drenching
himself
with
chloroform
but
this
morning
he
almost
forgot
his
own
sensations
in
pity
and
awe
of
the
multitudinous
agony
which
bore
him
company
so
nearly
supernatural
in
its
horror
was
the
burden
of
anguish
which
filled
that
long
train
of
jolting
wagons
that
it
seemed
at
times
to
his
fevered
imagination
as
if
he
were
out
of
the
world
and
journeying
in
the
realms
of
eternal
torment
the
sluggish
current
of
suffering
groaned
and
wailed
its
way
on
board
the
steam
transport
spreading
out
there
into
a
great
surface
of
torture
which
could
be
taken
in
by
a
single
sweep
of
the
eye
wounded
men
and
dying
men
filled
the
and
covered
the
cabin
floor
and
even
the
open
deck
there
was
a
perpetual
murmur
of
moans
athwart
which
passed
frequent
shrieks
from
sufferers
racked
to
madness
like
lightnings
darting
across
a
gloomy
sky
more
than
one
poor
fellow
drew
his
last
breath
in
the
wagons
and
on
board
the
transport
all
these
men
thought
colburne
are
dying
and
agonizing
for
their
country
and
for
human
freedom
he
prayed
and
without
arguing
the
matter
he
wearily
yet
calmly
trusted
that
god
would
grant
them
his
infinite
mercy
in
this
world
and
the
other
it
was
a
tiresome
voyage
from
springfield
landing
to
new
orleans
colburne
had
no
place
to
lie
down
and
if
he
had
had
one
he
could
not
have
slept
during
most
of
the
trip
he
sat
on
a
pile
of
baggage
holding
in
his
right
hand
a
tin
quart
cup
filled
with
ice
and
punctured
with
a
small
hole
through
which
the
chilled
water
dripped
upon
his
wounded
arm
great
was
the
excitement
in
the
city
when
the
ghastly
travellers
landed
it
was
already
known
there
that
an
assault
had
been
delivered
and
that
port
hudson
had
not
been
taken
but
no
particulars
had
been
published
which
might
indicate
that
the
union
army
had
suffered
a
severe
repulse
now
when
several
steamboats
discharged
a
gigantic
freight
of
mutilated
men
the
facts
of
defeat
and
slaughter
were
sanguinarily
apparent
secessionists
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
swarmed
in
the
streets
and
filled
them
with
a
buzz
of
inhuman
delight
creatures
in
the
guise
of
womanhood
laughed
and
told
their
little
children
to
laugh
at
the
pallid
faces
which
showed
from
the
ambulances
as
they
went
and
returned
in
frequent
journeys
between
the
levee
and
the
hospitals
the
officers
and
men
of
the
garrison
were
sad
stern
and
threatening
in
aspect
the
few
citizens
who
had
declared
for
the
union
cowered
by
themselves
and
exchanged
whispers
of
gloomy
foreboding
in
stephen
hospital
colburne
found
something
of
that
comfort
which
a
wounded
man
needs
his
arm
was
dressed
for
the
second
time
his
ragged
uniform
stiff
with
blood
and
dirt
was
removed
he
was
sponged
from
head
to
foot
and
laid
in
the
first
sheets
which
he
had
seen
for
months
there
were
three
other
wounded
officers
in
the
room
each
on
his
own
cot
each
stripped
stark
naked
and
covered
only
by
a
sheet
a
major
of
a
connecticut
regiment
who
had
received
a
grapeshot
through
the
lungs
smiled
at
colburne
arm
and
whispered
then
he
pointed
to
the
horrible
orifice
in
his
own
breast
through
which
the
blood
and
breath
could
be
seen
to
bubble
whenever
the
dressings
were
removed
and
nodded
with
another
feeble
but
heroic
smile
which
seemed
to
say
this
is
no
iced
water
appeared
to
be
the
only
exterior
medicament
in
use
and
the
hospital
nurses
were
constantly
drenching
the
dressings
with
this
simple
panacea
of
wise
old
mother
nature
but
in
this
early
stage
of
the
great
agony
before
the
citizens
had
found
it
in
their
hearts
to
act
the
part
of
the
good
samaritan
there
was
a
lack
of
attendance
happy
were
those
officers
who
had
their
servants
with
them
like
the
connecticut
major
or
who
like
colburne
had
strength
and
members
left
to
take
care
of
their
own
hurts
he
soon
hit
upon
a
device
to
lessen
his
labors
he
got
a
nurse
to
drive
a
hook
into
the
ceiling
and
suspend
his
quart
cup
of
ice
to
it
by
a
triangle
of
strings
so
that
it
might
hang
about
six
inches
above
his
wounded
arm
and
shed
its
dew
of
consolation
and
health
without
trouble
to
himself
in
his
fever
he
was
childishly
anxious
about
his
quart
cup
he
was
afraid
that
the
surgeon
the
nurse
the
visitors
would
hit
it
and
make
it
swing
that
arm
was
a
little
world
of
pain
it
radiated
pain
as
the
sun
radiates
light
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
drank
freely
of
strong
liquors
whiskey
was
the
internal
panacea
of
the
hospital
as
iced
water
was
the
outward
one
every
time
that
the
surgeon
visited
the
four
officers
he
sent
a
nurse
for
four
milk
punches
and
if
they
wanted
other
stimulants
such
as
claret
or
porter
they
could
have
them
for
the
asking
the
generosity
of
the
government
and
the
sublime
beneficence
of
the
sanitary
commission
supplied
every
necessary
and
many
luxuries
colburne
was
on
his
feet
in
hours
after
his
arrival
ashamed
to
lie
in
bed
under
the
eyes
of
that
mangled
and
heroic
major
he
was
promoted
to
the
table
and
then
to
the
table
holding
his
tin
cup
over
his
arm
he
made
frequent
rounds
of
the
hospital
cheering
up
the
wounded
and
finding
not
a
little
pleasure
in
watching
the
progress
of
individual
cases
he
never
acquired
a
taste
as
many
did
for
frequenting
the
and
as
van
zandt
phrased
it
seeing
them
butcher
this
sans
who
on
the
could
face
death
and
look
upon
ranks
of
slain
unblenchingly
was
at
heart
as
soft
as
a
woman
and
never
saw
a
surgeon
knife
touch
living
flesh
without
a
sensation
of
faintness
he
often
accompanied
the
chief
surgeon
in
his
tours
of
inspection
a
wonder
of
practical
philanthropy
was
this
queer
cheerful
indefatigable
doctor
jackson
as
brisk
and
inspiriting
as
a
mountain
breeze
tireless
in
body
fervent
in
spirit
a
benediction
with
the
rank
of
major
iced
water
whiskey
nourishment
and
encouragement
were
his
there
were
surgeons
who
themselves
drank
the
claret
and
brandy
of
the
sanitary
commission
and
gave
the
remnant
to
their
friends
who
poured
the
consolidated
milk
of
the
sanitary
commission
on
the
canned
peaches
of
the
sanitary
commission
and
put
the
grateful
mess
into
their
personal
stomachs
and
who
having
thus
comforted
themselves
went
out
with
a
pleasant
smile
to
see
their
patients
eat
bread
without
peaches
and
drink
coffee
without
milk
but
jackson
was
not
one
of
these
individuals
he
had
fibres
of
sympathy
which
reached
into
the
lives
of
others
especially
of
the
wretched
as
he
passed
through
the
crowded
wards
all
those
sick
eyes
turned
to
him
as
to
a
sun
of
strength
and
hope
he
never
left
a
wounded
man
however
near
to
death
but
the
poor
fellow
brightened
up
with
a
confidence
of
speedy
recovery
must
cheer
must
cheer
he
muttered
to
colburne
courage
is
a
great
medicine
best
in
the
world
works
miracles
yes
miracles
why
how
you
my
old
boy
he
said
aloud
stopping
before
a
patient
with
a
ball
in
the
breast
you
look
as
hearty
as
a
buck
this
morning
getting
on
wonderfully
he
gave
him
an
easy
slap
on
the
shoulder
as
if
he
considered
him
a
well
man
already
he
knew
just
where
to
administer
these
slaps
and
just
how
to
graduate
them
to
the
invalid
weakness
after
counting
the
pulse
he
smiled
in
his
face
with
an
air
of
astonishment
and
admiration
and
proceeded
beautiful
could
do
it
better
if
you
had
never
got
hit
nurse
bring
this
man
a
that
all
the
medicine
wants
when
they
had
got
a
few
yards
from
the
bed
he
sighed
jerked
his
thumb
backward
significantly
and
whispered
to
colburne
no
use
ca
save
him
no
vitality
they
stopped
to
examine
another
man
who
had
been
shot
through
the
head
from
temple
to
temple
but
without
unseating
life
from
its
throne
his
head
especially
about
the
face
was
swollen
to
an
amazing
magnitude
his
eyes
were
as
red
as
blood
and
projected
from
their
sockets
two
awful
lumps
of
inflammation
he
was
blind
and
deaf
but
able
to
drink
and
still
full
of
vital
force
fetch
him
round
i
whispered
the
doctor
with
a
smile
of
gratification
holds
out
beautiful
but
he
will
always
be
blind
and
probably
idiotic
no
not
idiotic
brain
as
sound
as
a
nut
as
for
blindness
ca
say
should
wonder
if
he
could
use
his
peepers
yet
great
doctor
old
nature
if
you
wo
get
in
her
way

why
in
the
peninsular
campaign
i
sent
off
one
man
well
with
a
in

there
your

put
a

ah

you
do

no
no

i
mean

pluck

they

so
quick
this
fellow
will
be
stealing
chickens
in
three
weeks
i
would
bet
that
i
kill
him
thus
in
the
very
tolerable
comfort
of
stephen
colburne
escaped
the
six
weeks
of
trying
siege
duty
which
his
regiment
had
to
perform
before
port
hudson
the
tenth
occupied
a
little
hollow
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
the
rebel
fortifications
protected
in
front
by
a
high
knoll
but
exposed
on
the
left
to
a
fire
which
hit
one
or
more
every
day
the
men
cut
a
terrace
on
their
own
side
of
the
knoll
and
then
topped
the
crest
with
a
double
line
of
logs
pierced
for
musketry
thus
forming
a
solid
and
convenient
breastwork
on
both
sides
the
sharpshooting
began
at
daybreak
and
lasted
till
nightfall
on
both
sides
the
marksmanship
grew
to
be
fatally
accurate
men
were
shot
dead
through
the
loopholes
as
they
took
aim
if
the
crown
of
a
hat
or
cap
showed
above
the
it
was
pierced
by
a
bullet
after
the
siege
was
over
a
rebel
officer
who
had
been
stationed
on
this
front
stated
that
most
of
his
killed
and
wounded
men
had
been
hit
just
above
the
line
of
the
forehead
every
morning
at
dawn
carter
who
had
his
quarters
in
the
midst
of
the
tenth
was
awakened
by
a
spattering
of
musketry
and
the
singing
of
through
the
branches
above
his
head
and
even
through
the
dry
foliage
of
his
own
sylvan
shanty
now
and
then
a
shriek
or
oath
indicated
that
a
bullet
had
done
its
brutal
work
on
some
human
frame
no
crowd
collected
the
men
were
hardened
to
such
tragedies
four
or
five
bore
the
victim
away
the
rest
asked
who
is
it
one
death
which
carter
witnessed
was
of
so
remarkable
a
character
that
he
wrote
an
account
of
it
to
his
wife
although
not
given
to
noting
with
much
interest
the
minor
and
personal
incidents
of
war
i
had
just
finished
breakfast
and
was
lying
on
my
back
smoking
a
bullet
whistled
so
unusually
low
as
to
attract
my
attention
and
struck
with
a
loud
smash
in
a
tree
about
twenty
feet
from
me
between
me
and
the
tree
a
soldier
with
his
great
coat
rolled
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
lay
on
his
back
reading
a
newspaper
which
he
held
in
both
hands
i
remember
smiling
to
myself
to
see
this
man
start
as
the
bullet
passed
some
of
his
comrades
left
off
playing
cards
and
looked
for
it
the
man
who
was
reading
remained
perfectly
still
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
paper
with
a
steadiness
which
i
thought
curious
considering
the
bustle
around
him
presently
i
noticed
that
there
were
a
few
drops
of
blood
on
his
neck
and
that
his
face
was
paling
calling
to
the
who
had
resumed
their
game
i
said
to
that
man
with
the
paper
they
went
to
him
spoke
to
him
touched
him
and
found
him
perfectly
dead
the
ball
had
struck
him
under
the
chin
traversed
the
neck
and
cut
the
spinal
column
where
it
joins
the
brain
making
a
fearful
hole
through
which
the
blood
had
already
soaked
his
it
was
this
head
and
not
the
tree
which
had
been
struck
with
such
a
report
there
he
lay
still
holding
the
new
york
independent
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
sermon
by
henry
ward
beecher
it
was
really
quite
a
remarkable
circumstance
by
the
way
you
must
not
suppose
my
dear
little
girl
that
bullets
often
come
so
near
me
i
am
as
careful
of
myself
as
you
exhort
me
to
be
not
quite
true
this
soothing
story
and
the
colonel
knew
it
to
be
false
as
he
wrote
it
he
knew
that
he
was
in
danger
of
death
at
any
moment
but
he
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
his
wife
so
and
make
her
unhappy
chapter

captain
colburne
reinforces
the
ravenels
in
time
to
aid
them
in
running
away
colburne
had
been
two
or
three
weeks
in
the
hospital
when
he
was
startled
by
seeing
doctor
ravenel
advancing
eagerly
upon
him
with
a
face
full
of
trouble
the
doctor
had
heard
of
the
young
man
hurt
and
as
his
sensitive
sympathy
invariably
exaggerated
danger
and
suffering
especially
if
they
concerned
any
one
whom
he
loved
he
had
imagined
the
worst
and
taken
the
first
boat
for
new
orleans
on
the
other
hand
colburne
surmised
from
that
concerned
countenance
that
the
doctor
brought
evil
tidings
of
his
daughter
was
she
unhappy
in
her
marriage
or
widowed
or
dead
he
laughed
outright
with
a
sense
of
relief
equivalent
to
positive
pleasure
when
he
learned
that
he
alone
was
the
cause
of
ravenel
worry
i
am
getting
along
famously
said
he
ask
doctor
jackson
here
i
am
not
sick
at
all
above
my

elbow
below
the
elbow
the
arm
seems

shook
his
head
with
the
resolute
incredulity
of
a
man
who
is
too
anxious
not
to
expect
the
worst
but
you
ca
continue
to
do
well
here
this
air
is
infected
this
great
mass
of
inflammation
suppuration
mortification
and
death
has
poisoned
the
atmosphere
of
the
hospital
i
scented
it
the
moment
i
entered
the
door
am
i
not
right
dr
jackson
just
so
ca
help
it
horrid
weather
for
cases
replied
the
chief
surgeon
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
air
poisoned
wish
to
god
i
could
get
a
fresh
building
my
patients
would
do
better
in
shanties
than
they
will
here
i
knew
it
said
ravenel
now
then
i
am
a
country
doctor
i
can
take
this
young
man
to
a
plantation
and
give
him
pure
air
that
what
you
want
observed
jackson
turning
to
colburne
your
arm
do
need
ice
now
water
will
do
better
go
i
think
i
see
that
you
have
a
month
leave
of
absence
come
you
can
go
to
taylorsville
and
still
not
miss
a
chance
for
fighting
tried
to
send
him
north
he
added
addressing
ravenel
but
he
foolish
about
it
wants
to
see
port
hudson
out
what
you
call
a
colburne
was
in
a
tremble
body
and
soul
at
the
thought
of
meeting
carter
he
had
never
been
so
profoundly
shaken
by
even
the
actuality
of
encountering
miss
ravenel
most
of
us
have
been
in
love
enough
to
understand
all
about
it
without
explanation
and
to
feel
no
wonder
at
him
because
after
reeling
mentally
this
way
and
that
he
finally
said
i
will
go
now
and
then
there
is
a
woman
who
can
not
bear
to
look
upon
the
man
whom
she
has
loved
and
lost
and
who
will
turn
quick
corners
and
run
down
side
streets
to
escape
him
haunting
him
spiritually
perhaps
but
bodily
keeping
afar
from
him
all
her
life
but
stronger
natures
who
can
endure
the
trial
frequently
go
to
meet
it
and
seem
to
find
some
dolorous
comfort
in
it
as
regards
colburne
it
may
be
that
he
would
not
have
gone
to
taylorsville
had
he
not
been
weak
and
feverish
and
felt
a
craving
for
that
petting
kindness
which
seems
to
be
a
necessity
of
invalids
i
doubt
whether
the
life
in
ravenel
house
contributed
much
to
advance
his
convalescence
his
emotions
were
played
upon
too
constantly
and
powerfully
for
the
highest
good
of
the
temporarily
shattered
instrument
he
had
supposed
that
he
would
undergo
one
great
shock
on
meeting
carter
and
that
then
his
trouble
would
be
over
the
first
thrill
was
not
so
potent
as
he
expected
but
it
was
succeeded
by
a
constant
unrest
like
the
burning
of
a
slow
fever
he
was
uneasy
all
day
and
slept
badly
at
night
in
the
house
he
could
not
talk
freely
and
gaily
because
of
lillie
presence
and
out
of
it
he
could
not
feel
with
calmness
because
he
was
perpetually
thinking
of
her
after
all
it
may
have
been
the
splinters
of
bone
in
the
arm
quite
as
much
as
the
arrow
in
the
heart
which
worried
him
of
carter
i
must
admit
that
she
was
not
merciful
she
made
the
captain
talk
a
great
deal
of
his
colonel
he
might
recite
carter
martial
deeds
and
qualities
as
lengthily
as
he
pleased
and
recommence
to
recite
them
over
again
not
only
without
fatiguing
her
but
without
exciting
in
her
mind
a
thought
that
he
was
doing
any
thing
remarkable
she
was
very
much
pleased
but
she
was
not
a
bit
grateful
why
should
she
be
it
was
perfectly
natural
to
her
mind
that
people
should
admire
the
colonel
and
talk
much
of
his
glory
colburne
performed
this
task
with
infinite
patience
sympathy
and
love
and
no
warrior
was
ever
better
sung
in
conversational
epics
than
was
carter
the
successful
by
colburne
the
disappointed
under
the
rude
oppression
of
this
subject
the
bruised
shrub
exhaled
daily
sweetness
it
is
almost
painful
to
contemplate
these
two
loving
hearts
the
one
sending
its
anxious
sympathies
a
hundred
miles
away
into
the
deadly
trenches
of
port
hudson
the
other
pouring
out
its
sympathies
for
a
present
object
but
covertly
and
without
a
thought
of
reward
if
the
passionate
affection
of
the
woman
is
charming
the
unrequited
unhoping
love
of
the
man
is
sublime
the
doctor
perhaps
saw
what
lillie
could
not
or
would
not
see
my
dear
he
observed
you
must
remember
that
colonel
carter
is
not
the
husband
of
captain
colburne
oh
papa
she
answered
do
you
suppose
that
he
does
like
to
talk
about
colonel
carter
of
course
he
does
he
admires
him
and
likes
him
immensely
i
dare
say
i
dare
say
but
nevertheless
you
give
him
very
large
doses
of
your
husband
no
papa
not
too
large
he
is
such
a
good
friend
that
i
am
sure
he
does
object
just
think
how
unkind
it
would
be
not
to
want
to
talk
about
my
husband
you
do
understand
him
if
you
think
he
is
so
shabby
nevertheless
the
doctor
was
partially
right
and
shabby
as
it
may
have
been
colburne
was
no
better
for
the
conversation
which
so
much
gratified
carter
his
arm
discharged
its
slivers
of
bone
and
healed
steadily
but
he
was
thin
and
pale
slept
badly
and
had
a
slow
fever
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
he
wilfully
brooded
over
his
disappointment
much
less
that
he
was
angry
about
it
or
felt
any
desire
to
avenge
it
he
was
too
sensible
not
to
struggle
against
useless
pinings
too
and
honorable
to
be
even
tempted
of
base
or
cruel
spirits
not
that
he
was
a
moral
miracle
not
that
he
was
even
a
marvellously
bright
exception
to
the
general
run
of
humanity
on
the
contrary
he
was
like
many
of
us
especially
when
we
are
under
the
influence
of
elevating
emotion
some
by
me
forgotten
author
has
remarked
that
no
earthly
being
is
purer
more
like
the
souls
in
paradise
than
a
young
man
during
his
first
earnest
love
at
one
time
colburne
entirely
forgot
himself
in
his
sympathy
for
carter
when
the
news
came
of
the
unsuccessful
and
murderous
assault
of
the
fourteenth
of
june
she
was
nearly
crazy
for
three
days
because
of
her
uncertainty
concerning
the
fate
of
her
husband
she
must
hear
constantly
from
her
comforters
the
assurance
that
all
was
undoubtedly
well
that
if
the
colonel
had
been
engaged
in
the
fighting
he
would
certainly
have
been
named
in
the
official
report
that
if
he
had
received
any
harm
he
would
have
been
all
the
more
sure
of
being
mentioned
etc
clinging
as
if
for
life
to
these
two
men
she
demanded
all
their
strength
to
keep
her
out
of
the
depths
of
despair
every
day
they
went
two
or
three
times
to
the
fort
one
or
other
of
them
to
gather
information
from
passing
boats
concerning
the
new
tragedy
very
honestly
and
earnestly
gratified
was
colburne
when
he
was
able
to
bring
to
carter
a
letter
from
her
husband
written
the
day
after
the
struggle
and
saying
that
no
harm
had
befallen
him
how
that
letter
was
wept
over
prayed
over
held
to
a
beating
heart
and
then
to
loving
lips
the
house
was
solemn
all
day
with
that
immense
and
unspeakable
joy
circumstances
soon
occurred
which
caused
this
lonely
and
anxious
family
to
be
troubled
about
its
own
safety
to
carry
on
the
siege
of
port
hudson
banks
had
been
obliged
to
reduce
the
garrison
of
new
orleans
and
of
its
vast
exterior
line
of
defences
a
hundred
miles
from
the
city
on
every
side
to
the
lowest
point
consistent
with
safety
meantime
taylor
reorganized
the
remnant
of
his
beaten
army
raised
new
levies
by
conscription
procured
reinforcements
from
texas
and
resumed
the
offensive
brashear
city
on
the
atchafalaya
with
its
immense
mass
of
commissary
stores
and
garrison
of
raw
nine
months
men
was
captured
by
surprise
a
smart
little
battle
was
fought
at
lafourche
crossing
near
thibodeaux
in
which
greene
texans
charged
with
their
usual
brilliant
impetuosity
but
were
repulsed
by
our
men
with
fearful
slaughter
after
a
struggle
over
the
contested
cannon
nevertheless
the
union
troops
soon
retired
before
superior
numbers
and
greene
wild
mounted
rangers
were
at
liberty
to
patrol
the
lafourche
interior
we
ca
stay
here
long
said
colburne
in
the
council
of
war
in
which
the
family
talked
these
matters
over
greene
will
come
this
way
sooner
or
later
if
he
can
take
fort
winthrop
he
will
thereby
blockade
the
mississippi
cut
off
banks
supplies
and
force
him
to
raise
the
siege
of
port
hudson
he
is
sure
to
try
it
sooner
or
later
must
we
leave
our
plantation
then
asked
ravenel
in
real
anguish
to
lose
his
home
his
invested
capital
pigs
chickens
prospective
crop
of
vegetables
and
worse
yet
of
enlightened
and
ennobled
negroes
was
indeed
a
torturing
calamity
had
he
known
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
that
before
morning
the
shaggy
ponies
and
long
lank
dirty
mosstroopers
of
greene
brigade
would
be
upon
him
he
would
not
have
paused
to
examine
the
situation
from
so
many
different
points
of
view
colburne
knew
by
experience
the
celerity
of
texan
rangers
he
had
chased
them
in
forced
marches
from
brashear
city
to
alexandria
without
ever
seeing
a
tail
of
their
horses
and
yet
even
he
indulged
in
a
false
security
i
think
we
have
twelve
hours
before
us
he
observed
morning
we
shall
have
to
get
up
and
get
as
the
natives
say
still
my
opinion
i
do
believe
carter
had
better
stay
here
she
ought
to
go
to
the
fort
are
you
going
papa
asked
carter
who
somehow
was
not
much
alarmed
my
dear
i
must
stay
here
till
the
last
moment
we
have
so
much
property
here
you
will
have
to
go
without
me
then
i
wo
go
she
answered
and
so
that
was
settled
ought
to
be
off
said
the
doctor
to
colburne
as
a
united
states
officer
you
are
sure
to
be
kept
a
prisoner
if
taken
i
certainly
think
that
you
ought
to
go
colburne
thought
so
too
but
would
not
desert
his
friends
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
spirit
and
resolved
to
endure
what
might
come
the
negroes
were
in
a
state
of
exquisite
alarm
the
entire
black
population
of
the
lafourche
interior
was
making
for
the
swamps
or
other
places
of
shelter
and
only
the
love
of
the
ravenel
gang
for
their
good
massa
and
beautiful
missus
kept
them
from
being
swept
away
by
the
contagious
current
the
horror
with
which
they
regarded
the
possibility
of
being
returned
into
slavery
delighted
the
doctor
who
even
in
those
circumstances
dilated
enthusiastically
upon
it
as
a
proof
that
the
race
was
capable
of
high
aspirations
they
have
already
acquired
the
love
of
individual
liberty
said
this
amiable
optimist
the
cognate
love
of
liberty
in
the
abstract
the
liberty
of
all
men
is
not
far
ahead
of
them
how
superior
they
already
are
to
the
white
wretches
who
are
fighting
to
send
them
back
to
slavery
shedding
blood
their
own
and
their
brothers
for
slavery
is
it
not
utterly
amazing
risking
life
and
taking
life
to
restore
slavery
it
is
the
foolishest
wickedest
most
demoniacal
infatuation
that
ever
possessed
humanity
the
inquisition
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
were
common
sense
and
evangelical
mercy
compared
to
this
rebellion
and
yet
these
imps
of
atrocity
pretend
to
be
christians
they
are
the
most
orthodox
creatures
that
ever
served
the
devil
they
rant
and
roar
in
the
methodist
they
dogmatize
on
the
doctrines
in
the
presbyterian
church
they
make
the
responses
in
the
episcopal
liturgy
there
is
only
one
pinnacle
of
hypocrisy
that
they
never
have
had
the
audacity
to
mount
they
have
not
yet
brought
themselves
to
make
the
continuance
and
spread
of
slavery
an
object
of
prayer
it
would
be
logical
you
know
it
would
be
just
like
their
impudence
i
have
expected
that
they
would
come
to
it
i
have
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
their
hypocritical
priesthood
would
put
up
bloody
hands
in
the
face
of
an
indignant
heaven
and
say
god
of
justice
o
jesus
lover
of
the
oppressed
bless
extend
and
perpetuate
slavery
prosper
us
in
selling
the
wife
away
from
the
husband
and
the
child
away
from
the
parent
enable
us
to
convert
the
blood
and
tears
of
our
fellow
creatures
into
filthy
lucre
help
us
to
degrade
man
who
was
made
in
thine
image
and
to
father
son
and
spirit
be
all
the
glory
can
you
imagine
anything
more
astoundingly
wicked
than
such
a
petition
and
yet
i
am
positively
astonished
that
they
have
not
got
up
monthly
concerts
of
prayer
and
fabricated
a
liturgy
all
pregnant
with
just
such
or
similar
blasphemies
but
god
would
not
wait
for
them
to
reach
this
acme
of
iniquity
his
patience
is
exhausted
and
he
is
even
now
bringing
them
to
punishment
they
have
some
power
left
yet
as
we
feel
said
colburne
yes
i
have
seen
an
adder
head
flatten
and
snap
ten
minutes
after
the
creature
was
cut
in
two
i
dare
say
it
might
have
inflicted
a
poisonous
wound
i
think
you
had
better
send
the
hands
to
the
fort
do
you
anticipate
such
immediate
danger
inquired
the
doctor
his
very
spectacles
expressing
surprise
i
feel
uneasy
every
time
i
think
of
those
texans
they
are
fast
boys
they
outmarch
their
own
shadows
sometimes
and
have
to
wait
for
them
to
come
in
after
nightfall
i
really
ought
to
send
the
hands
off
admitted
the
doctor
after
a
minute
of
reflection
i
never
could
forgive
myself
if
through
my
means
they
should
be
returned
to
bondage
it
would
be
a
poor
result
of
a
freedman
labor
experiment
the
doctor
went
to
the
back
door
and
shouted
for
major
scott
major
said
he
you
must
take
all
the
people
down
to
the
fort
as
soon
as
they
can
get
ready
they
all
ready
marsr
they
only
a
waitin
for
the
word
very
well
bring
them
along
i
write
a
note
to
the
commandant
asking
him
to
take
you
in
for
the
night
you
can
come
back
in
the
morning
if
all
is
quiet
what
a
gwine
to
come
of
you
an
miss
lillie
never
mind
that
now
i
will
see
to
that
presently
bring
the
people
along
in
five
minutes
fifteen
men
six
women
and
four
pickaninnies
the
whole
laboring
force
of
the
plantation
were
in
the
road
before
the
house
each
loaded
with
a
portion
of
his
or
her
property
such
as
blankets
food
and
cooking
utensils
the
men
looked
anxious
the
women
cried
loudly
with
fright
and
grief
the
pickaninnies
cried
because
their
mothers
did
oh
mars
ravenel
you
be
cotched
suah
sobbed
the
old
mamma
who
did
the
family
cooking
miss
lillie
do
come
with
us
gwine
to
tote
some
o
your
fixin
observed
major
scott
better
let
him
do
it
said
colburne
it
may
be
your
only
chance
to
save
necessaries
so
the
negroes
added
to
their
loads
whatever
seemed
most
valuable
and
essential
of
the
ravenel
baggage
then
scott
received
the
note
to
the
commandant
of
the
fort
handed
it
to
julius
the
second
boss
and
remarked
with
dignity
i
stays
with
marsr
the
major
was
undisguisedly
alarmed
but
he
had
a
character
to
sustain
and
a
military
title
to
justify
he
was
immediately
joined
in
his
forlorn
hope
by
jim
the
no
nigger
who
being
a
sly
and
limber
darkey
fleet
of
foot
and
familiar
with
swamp
life
had
a
faith
that
he
could
wriggle
out
of
any
danger
or
captivity
keep
them
said
colburne
to
ravenel
we
shall
want
them
as
during
the
night
there
was
an
evident
hesitation
in
the
whole
gang
as
to
whether
they
should
go
or
stay
but
colburne
settled
the
question
by
pronouncing
in
a
tone
of
military
command
forward
march
ah
they
knows
how
to
mind
that
sort
o
talk
said
major
scott
highly
gratified
with
the
spectacular
nature
of
the
scene
a
been
eddycatin
to
millingtary
ways
they
knows
a
heap
they
doos
he
smiled
with
a
simple
and
transitory
joy
although
he
could
hear
the
voice
of
his
wife
commonly
called
mamma
major
rising
in
loud
lament
amid
the
chorus
of
sorrow
with
which
the
women
and
children
moved
away
the
poor
creature
kept
no
grudge
against
her
husband
for
his
infidelity
of
a
month
previous
in
the
lonely
and
imperilled
little
household
colburne
now
took
command
since
you
will
fight
he
said
smiling
you
must
fight
under
my
orders
i
am
the
military
power
and
i
proclaim
martial
law
he
forbade
the
ravenels
to
undress
they
must
be
prepared
to
run
at
a
moment
notice
he
laughed
at
the
doctor
proposition
to
barricade
the
doors
and
windows
and
instead
thereof
opened
two
or
three
trunks
and
scattered
articles
of
little
value
about
the
rooms
the
property
would
be
a
bait
he
said
which
might
amuse
the
raiders
while
the
family
escaped
to
gratify
major
scott
tremulous
enthusiasm
he
loaded
his
own
revolver
and
the
doctor
smiling
sadly
to
himself
to
think
how
absurd
was
the
idea
of
fighting
off
a
band
of
texans
with
such
a
feeble
artillery
he
posted
the
two
negroes
as
a
vidette
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
road
with
strict
orders
not
to
build
a
fire
not
to
sleep
not
to
make
a
noise
but
in
case
of
the
approach
of
a
party
to
hasten
to
the
house
and
give
information
the
major
begged
hard
for
the
but
colburne
would
not
let
him
have
it
he
would
be
worse
than
a
nine
months
man
he
said
to
the
doctor
he
would
be
banging
away
at
stumps
and
shadows
all
night
there
would
be
a
living
field
mouse
on
the
plantation
by
morning
the
doctor
imagination
was
seriously
affected
by
these
preparations
and
he
silently
regretted
that
he
had
not
gone
to
the
fort
or
at
least
sent
his
daughter
thither
lillie
though
quiet
was
very
pale
and
wished
herself
in
the
trenches
of
port
hudson
safe
under
the
protection
of
her
invincible
husband
colburne
urged
and
finally
ordered
them
to
lie
down
and
try
to
sleep
two
mules
were
standing
in
the
yard
saddled
and
ready
to
do
their
part
in
the
hegira
when
it
should
be
necessary
he
examined
their
harness
then
returned
into
the
house
buckled
on
his
sword
and
revolver
extinguished
every
light
took
his
seat
at
an
open
window
looking
towards
the
danger
waited
and
listened
the
youthful
veteran
was
perfectly
calm
notwithstanding
that
he
had
taken
more
precautions
than
a
greenhorn
however
timorous
would
have
thought
of
once
in
each
hour
he
visited
the
negroes
to
see
if
they
were
awake
then
mounted
the
levee
to
listen
for
tramp
of
men
or
horses
across
the
bayou
then
went
to
the
and
listened
towards
the
woods
which
backed
the
plantation
then
resumed
his
silent
watch
at
the
open
window
at
two
the
moon
still
poured
a
pale
light
over
the
flat
landscape
colburne
feverish
with
fatigue
want
of
sleep
and
the
small
remainder
of
irritation
in
his
wound
was
just
saying
to
himself
we
go
when
he
saw
two
dark
forms
glide
rapidly
towards
the
house
under
cover
of
a
fence
and
rush
crouching
across
the
without
waiting
to
hear
what
the
negroes
had
to
say
he
stepped
into
the
parlor
and
awoke
the
two
sleepers
on
the
sofas
what
is
the
matter
gasped
the
doctor
with
the
wild
air
common
to
people
startled
out
of
an
anxious
slumber
perhaps
nothing
answered
colburne
only
be
ready
by
this
time
the
two
videttes
were
in
the
house
breathless
with
running
and
alarm
oh
cap
they
a
comin
whispered
scott
they
a
comin
right
smart
we
heerd
the
hosses
they
a
quarter
mile
off
mebbe
but
they
a
comin
right
smart
oh
cap
please
give
me
the
gun
i
wants
to
fight
for
my
liberty
an
for
mars
ravenel
an
for
miss
lillie
take
it
said
colburne
now
then
doctor
you
and
jim
will
hurry
carter
directly
down
the
road
to
the
fort
jim
can
keep
up
on
foot
the
major
and
i
will
go
to
the
woods
fire
from
there
and
draw
the
enemy
in
that
direction
every
one
obeyed
him
without
a
word
the
approaching
tramp
of
horses
was
distinctly
audible
at
the
house
when
the
ravenels
mounted
the
mules
and
set
off
at
a
lumbering
trot
the
animals
being
urged
forward
by
resounding
whacks
from
jim
bludgeon
colburne
scowled
and
grated
his
teeth
with
impatience
and
vexation
i
ought
to
have
sent
them
away
last
evening
he
muttered
with
a
throb
of
scott
you
and
i
will
have
to
fight
he
said
aloud
they
never
can
escape
unless
we
keep
the
rascals
here
we
must
fire
once
from
the
house
then
run
to
the
woods
and
fire
again
there
we
must
show
ourselves
men
now
yes
mars
cap
replied
the
major
his
voice
was
tremulous
and
his
whole
frame
shook
but
he
was
nevertheless
ready
to
die
if
need
be
for
his
liberty
and
his
benefactors
of
physical
courage
the
poor
fellow
had
little
but
in
moral
courage
he
was
at
this
moment
sublime
colburne
posted
himself
and
his
comrade
at
a
back
corner
of
the
house
where
they
could
obtain
a
view
of
the
road
which
led
toward
thibodeaux
now
scott
he
said
you
must
not
fire
until
i
have
fired
you
must
not
fire
until
you
have
taken
aim
at
somebody
you
must
fire
only
one
barrel
then
you
must
make
for
the
woods
along
the
line
of
this
fence
if
they
follow
us
on
horseback
we
can
bother
them
by
dodging
over
the
fence
now
and
then
if
they
catch
us
we
must
fight
as
long
as
we
can
cheer
up
old
fellow
it
all
right
it
not
bad
business
as
soon
as
you
used
to
it
cap
ready
answered
scott
solemnly
not
gwine
for
ter
be
cotched
alive
then
he
prayed
for
some
minutes
in
a
low
whisper
while
colburne
stood
at
the
corner
and
watched
watch
and
pray
the
latter
repeated
to
himself
smiling
inwardly
at
the
odd
compliance
with
the
double
injunction
so
strangely
does
the
mind
work
on
such
occasions
it
was
not
a
deliberate
process
of
intellection
with
him
it
was
an
instinctive
flash
of
ideas
not
traceable
to
any
feeling
which
was
in
him
at
the
time
on
the
contrary
his
prevailing
emotion
was
one
of
extreme
anxiety
the
tramp
which
fled
toward
the
fort
gently
diminished
in
the
distance
while
the
tramp
which
approached
from
the
opposite
side
grew
nearer
and
louder
when
the
advancing
horsemen
got
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
house
they
slackened
their
pace
to
a
walk
and
finally
halted
probably
to
listen
some
of
them
must
have
dismounted
at
this
time
for
colburne
suddenly
beheld
four
footmen
at
the
front
gate
he
scowled
at
this
sign
of
experienced
caution
and
gave
a
hasty
glance
toward
the
garden
in
his
rear
to
see
if
others
were
not
cutting
off
his
retreat
he
could
not
discover
the
features
of
any
of
the
four
but
he
could
see
that
they
were
of
the
tall
and
lank
texan
type
dressed
in
brownish
clothing
and
provided
with
short
guns
no
doubt
inside
of
the
gate
they
halted
and
seemed
to
hearken
while
one
of
them
pointed
up
the
road
toward
the
fort
and
whispered
to
his
comrades
colburne
had
hoped
that
they
would
get
into
the
house
and
fall
to
plundering
but
they
had
evidently
overheard
the
fugitives
for
there
was
a
simultaneous
backward
movement
in
the
group
they
were
going
to
remount
and
pursue
now
was
his
time
if
ever
to
effect
the
proposed
diversion
aiming
his
revolver
at
the
tallest
he
fired
a
single
barrel
the
man
yelled
a
curse
staggered
dropped
his
gun
and
leaned
against
the
fence
two
of
his
comrades
sprang
across
the
road
and
threw
themselves
behind
the
levee
as
a
while
the
fourth
all
grit
turned
short
and
brought
his
to
a
level
as
colburne
drew
behind
his
cover
in
that
same
moment
major
scott
wild
with
a
sudden
madness
of
conflict
shouted
like
a
lion
bounded
beyond
the
angle
of
the
house
planting
himself
on
two
feet
set
wide
apart
his
mad
black
face
set
toward
the
enemy
and
his
gun
aimed
both
fired
at
the
same
instant
and
both
fell
together
probably
alike
lifeless
the
last
prayer
of
the
negro
was
my
god
and
the
last
curse
of
the
rebel
was
damnation
by
the
light
of
the
moon
colburne
looked
at
his
comrade
and
saw
the
brains
following
the
blood
from
a
hole
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
levee
fired
one
more
barrel
at
a
hat
which
rose
above
it
listened
for
a
second
to
an
advancing
rush
of
hoofs
in
order
to
decide
whether
it
came
by
the
road
or
by
the
fields
turned
crossed
the
garden
on
a
noiseless
run
placed
himself
on
the
further
side
of
a
high
and
close
and
followed
its
cover
rapidly
toward
the
forest
the
distance
was
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
but
he
was
quite
breathless
and
faint
before
he
had
traversed
it
so
weak
was
he
still
and
so
little
accustomed
to
exercise
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
sat
down
on
a
fallen
and
mouldering
trunk
to
listen
if
the
cavalry
were
pursuing
their
course
up
the
road
they
were
doing
it
very
prudently
and
slowly
for
he
could
hear
no
more
trampling
of
horses
tolerably
satisfied
as
to
the
safety
of
the
ravenels
he
reloaded
his
two
empty
barrels
settled
his
course
in
his
mind
and
pushed
as
straight
as
he
could
for
taylorsville
without
quitting
the
cover
of
the
forest
although
the
fort
was
not
four
miles
away
in
a
direct
line
it
was
daybreak
when
he
came
in
sight
of
a
low
flattened
outline
as
of
a
truncated
mound
which
showed
dimly
through
the
yellowish
morning
mist
he
had
still
to
cross
a
dead
level
of
four
or
five
hundred
yards
with
no
points
of
shelter
but
three
small
wooden
houses
at
this
moment
when
safety
seemed
so
near
and
sure
he
saw
on
the
bayou
road
two
hundred
yards
to
his
right
half
a
dozen
black
and
indistinct
bunches
moving
in
a
direction
parallel
to
his
own
they
were
unquestionably
horsemen
going
toward
the
fort
and
nearer
to
it
than
he
changing
his
direction
he
made
straight
for
the
river
struck
it
above
the
fortification
and
got
behind
the
levee
thus
securing
both
a
covered
way
to
hide
his
course
and
an
earthwork
from
behind
which
he
could
fight
he
lost
no
time
in
peeping
over
the
top
of
the
mound
but
pushed
ahead
at
his
best
speed
supposing
that
no
cavalry
scouts
would
dare
approach
very
near
to
a
garrison
supplied
with
artillery
he
could
see
a
sentry
pacing
the
ramparts
the
dark
uniform
showing
clear
against
the
grey
sky
beyond
he
even
thought
that
the
man
perceived
him
and
supposed
that
his
dangers
were
over
for
the
present
he
was
full
of
exhilaration
and
glanced
back
at
the
events
of
the
night
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
taking
it
all
for
granted
with
a
resolute
faith
of
satisfaction
that
the
ravenels
had
escaped
major
scott
was
dead
he
was
really
quite
sorry
for
that
but
then
two
texans
had
been
killed
or
at
least
disabled
the
war
was
so
much
nearer
its
close
in
a
small
way
he
felt
much
as
a
general
does
who
has
effected
a
masterly
retreat
and
inflicted
severe
loss
upon
the
pursuing
enemy
presently
a
break
in
the
bank
forced
him
to
mount
the
levee
as
he
reached
the
top
he
stared
in
astonishment
and
some
dismay
at
a
man
in
clothing
mounted
on
a
rough
pony
with
the
gun
of
greene
mosstroopers
across
his
who
was
posted
on
the
road
not
forty
feet
distant
the
butternut
immediately
said
in
the
pleasant
way
current
in
armies
halt
you
son
of
a
bitch
he
fired
but
missed
as
colburne
skirted
the
break
on
a
run
and
sprang
again
behind
the
levee
the
captain
then
fired
in
return
with
no
other
effect
than
to
make
the
butternut
gallop
beyond
revolver
range
from
this
distance
he
called
out
ironically
i
say
yank
have
you
heard
from
brashear
city
colburne
made
no
reply
but
continued
his
retreat
unmolested
when
the
sentinel
challenged
halt
who
comes
there
he
thought
he
had
never
heard
a
pleasanter
welcome
friend
he
answered
halt
friend
corporal
of
the
guard
number
five
shouted
the
sentry
the
corporal
appeared
recognized
colburne
and
let
him
in
through
the
gate
in
a
palisade
which
connected
one
angle
of
the
fort
with
the
river
the
garrison
was
already
under
arms
and
the
men
were
lying
down
behind
the
low
works
with
their
equipments
on
and
their
muskets
by
their
sides
the
first
person
from
the
plantation
whom
colburne
saw
was
mauma
major
where
is
carter
aunty
he
asked
they
all
here
bress
the
lord
and
now
you
come
shouted
the
good
fat
creature
clapping
her
hands
with
delight
whar
my
ole
man
in
heaven
said
colburne
with
a
solemn
tenderness
which
carried
instant
conviction
the
woman
screamed
and
went
down
upon
her
knees
with
an
air
and
face
of
such
anguish
as
might
cast
shame
upon
those
philosophers
as
have
asserted
that
the
negro
is
not
a
man
oh
the
lord
gave
the
lord
gave
she
repeated
wildly
perhaps
she
had
forgotten
perhaps
she
never
knew
the
remainder
of
the
text
but
its
piteous
sense
of
bereavement
and
of
more
than
human
consolation
was
evidently
clear
in
some
manner
to
her
soul
chapter
xxiii
captain
colburne
covers
the
retreat
of
the
southern
labor
organization
colburne
soon
discovered
the
ravenels
and
their
retainers
bivouacked
in
an
angle
of
the
fortification
the
doctor
actually
embraced
him
in
delight
at
his
escape
and
carter
seized
both
his
hands
in
hers
exclaiming
oh
i
am
so
happy
she
was
full
of
gayety
she
had
had
a
splendid
nap
had
actually
slept
out
of
doors
did
he
see
that
tent
made
out
of
a
blanket
she
had
slept
in
that
she
could
bivouac
as
well
as
you
captain
colburne
she
was
as
good
a
soldier
as
you
captain
colburne
she
liked
it
of
all
things
in
the
world
she
never
would
sleep
in
the
house
again
till
she
was
fif
sixty
it
was
curious
to
note
how
she
checked
herself
upon
the
point
of
mentioning
fifty
as
the
era
of
first
decrepitude
her
father
was
over
fifty
and
therefore
fifty
could
not
be
old
age
notwithstanding
her
preconceived
opinions
on
the
subject
but
oh
how
obliged
we
are
to
you
she
added
changing
suddenly
to
a
serious
view
how
kind
and
noble
and
brave
you
are
we
owe
you
so
much
is
it
strange
that
i
should
be
saying
such
things
to
you
i
never
thought
that
i
should
ever
say
anything
of
the
kind
to
any
man
but
my
father
and
my
husband
i
am
indeed
grateful
to
you
and
thankful
that
you
have
escaped
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
there
was
a
singular
changeableness
about
her
of
late
she
shifted
rapidly
and
without
warning
almost
without
cause
from
one
emotion
to
another
she
felt
and
expressed
all
emotions
with
more
than
usual
fervor
she
was
sadder
at
times
and
gayer
at
times
than
circumstances
seemed
to
justify
an
ordinary
observer
a
man
especially
would
have
been
apt
to
consider
some
of
her
conduct
odd
if
not
irrational
the
truth
is
that
she
had
been
living
a
new
life
for
the
past
two
months
and
that
her
being
physical
and
moral
had
not
yet
been
able
to
settle
into
a
tranquil
unity
of
function
and
feeling
many
women
and
a
few
men
will
understand
me
here
colburne
was
too
merely
a
young
man
to
comprehend
anything
but
he
could
stand
a
little
way
off
and
worship
he
thought
as
she
faced
him
with
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
eyes
the
brighter
for
tears
that
she
was
very
near
in
guise
and
nature
to
an
angel
it
may
be
a
paradox
it
may
be
a
dangerous
fact
to
make
public
but
he
certainly
was
loving
another
man
wife
with
perfect
innocence
what
is
the
matter
with
mauma
major
asked
the
doctor
colburne
briefly
related
the
martyrdom
of
scott
and
father
and
daughter
hurried
to
console
the
weeping
black
woman
then
the
young
soldier
bethought
himself
that
he
ought
to
report
his
knowledge
of
the
rebels
to
the
commandant
of
the
garrison
you
find
the
cuss
in
there
said
a
lieutenant
pointing
to
a
brick
structure
in
the
centre
of
the
fort
colburne
entered
saw
an
officer
sleeping
on
a
pile
of
blankets
and
to
his
astonishment
recognized
him
as
major
gazaway
in
slumber
this
remarkable
poltroon
looked
respectably
formidable
he
was
six
feet
in
height
and
nearly
two
hundred
pounds
in
weight
dark
in
complexion
aquiline
in
feature
masculine
and
even
stern
in
expression
he
had
begun
life
as
a
prize
fighter
but
had
failed
in
that
career
not
because
he
lacked
strength
or
skill
but
from
want
of
pluck
to
stand
the
hammering
nevertheless
he
was
a
tolerable
hand
at
a
fight
and
still
more
efficient
in
bullying
and
browbeating
for
the
last
ten
years
he
had
kept
a
billiard
saloon
had
held
various
small
public
offices
and
had
been
the
isaiah
rynders
of
his
little
city
on
the
stump
he
had
a
low
kind
of
popular
eloquence
made
up
of
coarse
denunciation
slanderous
lying
slang
smutty
stories
and
profanity
the
rebellion
broke
out
the
rebel
cannon
aimed
at
fort
sumter
knocked
the
breath
out
of
the
democratic
party
and
gazaway
turned
republican
bringing
over
two
hundred
fighting
voters
and
changing
the
political
complexion
of
his
district
consequently
he
easily
got
a
commission
as
captain
in
the
three
campaign
and
subsequently
as
major
in
the
tenth
much
to
the
disgust
of
its
commandant
he
had
expected
and
demanded
a
colonelcy
he
thought
that
the
governor
in
not
granting
it
had
treated
him
with
ingratitude
and
black
injustice
he
honestly
believed
this
and
was
naively
sore
and
angry
on
the
subject
it
needed
this
trait
of
born
impudence
to
render
his
character
altogether
contemptible
for
had
he
been
a
conscious
humble
coward
he
would
have
merited
a
pity
not
altogether
disunited
from
respect
from
the
day
of
receiving
his
commission
gazaway
had
not
ceased
to
intrigue
and
bully
for
promotion
in
a
long
series
of
blotted
and
letters
how
could
a
mere
major
ever
hope
to
go
before
the
people
successfully
as
a
candidate
for
congress
that
distinction
was
the
aim
of
gazaway
as
of
many
another
more
or
less
successful
blackguard
it
is
true
that
these
horrid
battles
occasionally
shook
his
ambition
and
his
confidence
in
his
own
merits
under
fire
he
was
a
meek
man
much
given
to
lying
low
to
praying
fervently
to
thinking
that
a
whole
skin
was
better
than
laurels
but
in
a
few
hours
after
the
danger
was
past
his
elastic
vanity
and
selfishness
rose
to
the
occasion
and
he
was
as
pompous
in
air
as
dogmatical
in
speech
as
impudently
greedy
in
his
demands
for
advancement
as
ever
such
was
one
of
superior
officers
such
was
the
dastard
to
whom
the
wounded
hero
reported
for
duty
colburne
by
the
way
had
never
asked
for
promotion
believing
with
the
faith
of
chivalrous
youth
that
merit
would
be
sure
of
undemanded
recognition
after
several
calls
of
major
the
slumberer
came
to
his
consciousness
he
used
it
by
rolling
over
on
his
side
and
endeavoring
to
resume
his
dozings
he
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
till
late
the
night
before
on
account
of
his
terrors
and
now
he
was
reposing
like
an
animal
anxious
chiefly
to
be
let
alone
major
excuse
me
i
have
something
of
importance
to
report
insisted
the
captain
well
what
is
it
snarled
gazaway
then
catching
sight
of
colburne
oh
that
you
cap
where
from
from
a
plantation
five
miles
below
on
the
bayou
i
was
followed
in
closely
by
the
rebel
cavalry
their
pickets
are
less
than
half
a
mile
from
the
fort
my
god
exclaimed
gazaway
sitting
up
and
throwing
off
his
what
do
you
think
they
ai
going
to
attack
the
fort
be
they
then
calling
his
homespun
pomposity
to
his
aid
he
added
with
a
show
of
bravado
i
ca
see
it
they
know
better
we
can
knock
spots
out
of
of
course
we
can
coincided
the
captain
i
do
believe
they
have
any
siege
artillery
and
if
we
ca
beat
off
an
assault
we
ought
to
be
cap
i
vow
i
wish
i
had
your
health
said
the
major
gazing
shamelessly
at
colburne
thin
and
pale
face
you
can
stand
anything
i
used
to
think
i
could
but
this
cussed
climate
fetches
i
swear
i
hai
been
myself
since
i
come
to
louisianny
it
is
true
that
the
major
had
not
been
in
field
service
what
he
once
honestly
thought
he
was
he
had
supposed
himself
to
be
a
brave
man
he
was
never
disenchanted
of
this
belief
except
while
on
the
and
after
he
had
run
away
he
always
said
and
tried
to
believe
that
it
was
because
he
was
sick
i
was
took
sick
with
my
old
trouble
he
continued
same
as
i
had
at
new
orleans
you
know
the
very
day
that
we
attacked
port
hudson
by
the
way
he
had
not
had
it
at
new
orleans
he
had
had
it
at
georgia
landing
and
camp
beasland
but
colburne
did
not
correct
him
by
george
what
a
day
that
was
he
exclaimed
referring
to
the
assault
of
the
of
may
i
bet
a
hundred
shots
come
within
five
feet
of
me
if
i
could
a
kep
up
with
the
regiment
i
a
done
it
but
i
could
i
had
to
go
straight
to
the
hospital
i
tell
you
i
suffered
there
i
could
get
no
kind
of
attention
there
was
so
many
wounded
there
after
a
few
days
i
set
out
for
the
regiment
and
found
it
in
a
holler
where
the
rebel
bullets
was
skipping
about
like
parched
peas
in
a
skillet
but
i
was
too
sick
to
stand
it
i
had
to
put
back
to
the
hospital
finally
the
doctor
he
sent
me
to
new
orleans
well
i
was
just
gettin
a
little
flesh
on
my
bones
when
general
emory
ordered
every
man
that
could
walk
to
be
put
to
duty
nothing
would
do
but
i
must
take
command
of
this
fort
i
got
here
yesterday
morning
and
the
boat
went
back
in
the
afternoon
and
here
we
be
in
a
hell
of
a
muss
i
brought
twenty
such
invalids
along
men
no
more
fit
for
duty
than
i
be
i
swear
it
a
shame
colburne
did
not
utter
the
disgust
and
contempt
which
he
felt
he
turned
away
in
silence
intending
to
look
up
dressings
for
his
arm
which
had
become
dry
and
feverish
the
major
called
him
back
i
say
cap
if
the
enemy
are
in
force
what
are
we
to
do
why
we
shall
fight
of
course
but
we
got
men
enough
to
stand
an
assault
how
many
one
little
louisianny
men
two
nine
months
men
and
a
few
invalids
that
enough
have
you
any
spare
arms
i
i
reckon
so
said
the
major
in
a
peevish
tone
i
reckon
you
better
hunt
up
the
quartermaster
if
there
is
one
i
he
has
a
friend
of
mine
has
brought
fifteen
negroes
into
the
fort
i
want
guns
for
them
niggers
sneered
the
major
what
good
be
they
losing
all
patience
colburne
disrespectfully
turned
his
back
without
answering
and
left
the
room
i
say
cap
if
we
let
them
niggers
fight
we
be
all
massacred
were
the
last
words
that
he
heard
from
gazaway
having
got
his
arm
bound
anew
with
wet
dressings
he
sought
out
the
quartermaster
and
proceeded
to
accouter
the
ravenel
negroes
meanwhile
chewing
a
breakfast
of
hard
crackers
then
meeting
the
lieutenant
who
had
directed
him
to
gazaway
quarters
and
who
proved
to
be
the
commandant
of
the
louisiana
company
they
made
a
tour
of
the
ramparts
together
doing
their
volunteer
best
to
take
in
the
military
features
of
the
flat
surrounding
landscape
and
to
decide
upon
the
line
of
approach
which
the
rebels
would
probably
select
in
case
of
an
assault
there
was
no
cover
except
two
or
three
wooden
houses
of
such
slight
texture
that
they
would
afford
no
protection
against
shell
or
grape
the
levee
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bayou
might
shelter
sharpshooters
but
not
a
column
they
trained
a
iron
gun
in
that
direction
and
pointed
the
rest
of
the
artillery
so
as
to
sweep
the
plain
between
the
fort
and
a
wood
half
a
mile
distant
the
ditch
was
deep
and
wide
and
well
filled
with
water
but
there
was
no
abattis
or
other
obstruction
outside
of
it
the
weakest
front
was
toward
the
mississippi
on
which
side
the
rampart
was
a
mere
bank
not
five
feet
in
height
scarcely
dominating
the
slope
of
or
thirty
yards
which
stretched
between
it
and
the
water
i
wish
the
river
was
higher
smack
up
to
the
fortifications
said
the
louisiana
lieutenant
they
can
wade
around
them
fences
he
added
pointing
to
the
palisades
which
connected
the
work
with
the
river
this
officer
was
not
a
louisianian
by
birth
any
more
than
the
men
whom
he
commanded
they
were
a
medley
of
all
nations
principally
irish
and
germans
and
he
had
begun
his
martial
career
as
a
volunteer
in
an
indiana
regiment
he
was
chock
full
of
fight
and
confidence
this
was
the
only
fort
he
had
ever
garrisoned
and
he
considered
it
almost
impregnable
his
single
doubt
was
lest
the
assailants
might
wade
in
around
them
fences
colburne
remembering
how
banks
had
been
repulsed
twice
from
inferior
works
at
port
hudson
also
thought
the
chances
good
for
a
defence
indeed
he
looked
forward
to
the
combat
with
something
like
a
vindictive
satisfaction
heretofore
he
had
always
attacked
and
he
wanted
to
fight
the
rebels
once
from
behind
a
rampart
he
wanted
to
teach
them
what
it
was
to
storm
fortifications
if
he
had
been
better
educated
in
his
profession
he
would
have
found
the
fort
alarmingly
small
and
open
destitute
as
it
was
of
casemates
and
traverses
the
river
showed
no
promise
of
succor
not
a
gunboat
or
transport
appeared
on
its
broad
slow
yellow
current
not
a
friendly
smoke
could
be
seen
across
the
flat
distances
the
little
garrison
it
seemed
must
rely
upon
its
own
strength
and
courage
but
after
taking
a
deliberate
view
of
all
the
circumstances
colburne
felt
justified
in
reporting
to
major
gazaway
that
the
fort
could
beat
off
as
many
texans
as
could
stand
between
it
and
the
woods
which
was
the
same
as
to
say
a
matter
of
one
or
two
hundred
thousand
leaving
his
superior
officer
in
a
state
of
spasmodic
and
courage
he
spread
his
rubber
blanket
in
a
shady
corner
rolled
up
his
coat
for
a
pillow
laid
himself
down
and
slept
till
nearly
noon
when
he
awoke
the
doctor
was
holding
an
umbrella
over
him
i
am
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
said
colburne
sitting
up
not
at
all
i
was
afraid
you
might
get
the
fever
our
louisiana
sun
you
know
does
dispense
beneficence
alone
i
saw
that
it
had
found
you
out
and
i
rushed
to
the
rescue
is
carter
sheltered
asked
the
captain
she
is
very
comfortably
off
considering
the
circumstances
he
was
twiddling
and
twirling
his
umbrella
as
though
he
had
something
on
his
mind
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
he
said
after
a
moment
i
should
really
like
a
gun
if
it
is
not
too
much
trouble
the
idea
of
the
doctor
with
his
years
his
peaceful
habits
and
his
spectacles
rushing
to
battle
made
colburne
smile
another
imaginary
picture
the
image
of
lillie
weeping
over
her
father
body
restored
his
seriousness
what
would
carter
say
to
it
he
asked
i
should
be
obliged
if
you
would
not
mention
it
to
her
answered
the
doctor
i
think
the
matter
can
be
managed
without
her
knowledge
accordingly
colburne
fitted
out
this
unexpected
recruit
with
a
and
showed
him
how
to
load
it
and
how
to
put
on
his
accoutrements
this
done
he
reverted
to
the
subject
which
most
interested
his
mind
just
at
present
carter
must
be
better
sheltered
than
she
is
he
said
in
case
of
an
assault
she
would
be
in
the
way
where
she
is
and
moreover
she
might
get
hit
by
a
chance
bullet
i
will
tell
the
major
that
his
colonel
wife
is
here
and
that
he
must
turn
out
for
her
do
you
think
it
best
questioned
the
doctor
really
i
hate
to
disturb
the
commandant
of
the
fort
but
colburne
did
think
it
best
and
gazaway
was
not
hard
to
convince
he
hated
to
lose
his
shelter
poor
as
it
was
but
he
had
a
salutary
dread
of
his
absent
colonel
and
remembering
how
dubious
had
been
his
own
record
in
field
service
he
thought
it
wise
to
secure
the
favor
of
carter
accordingly
lillie
accompanied
by
black
julia
moved
into
the
brick
building
notwithstanding
her
late
declarations
that
she
liked
nothing
so
well
as
sleeping
in
the
open
air
premature
old
age
laughed
colburne
sixty
already
it
is
the
african
dahomey
and
not
the
american
which
produces
the
amazons
observed
the
doctor
if
you
do
stop
i
shall
be
severe
threatened
lillie
i
have
a
door
now
to
turn
people
out
of
just
as
though
that
was
a
punishment
said
colburne
i
thought
was
the
place
to
live
as
is
usual
with
people
in
circumstances
of
romance
which
are
not
instantly
and
overpoweringly
alarming
there
was
an
exhilaration
in
their
spirits
which
tended
towards
gayety
while
carter
and
colburne
were
thus
jesting
the
doctor
shyly
introduced
his
martial
equipments
into
the
house
and
concealed
them
under
a
blanket
in
one
corner
presently
the
two
men
adjourned
to
the
ramparts
to
learn
the
cause
of
a
commotion
which
was
visible
among
the
garrison
far
up
the
bayou
road
thin
yellow
clouds
of
dust
could
be
seen
rising
above
the
trees
no
doubt
indicating
a
movement
of
troops
in
considerable
force
from
that
quarter
no
advance
of
friends
but
only
of
texan
cavalry
and
louisianian
infantry
could
be
expected
nearly
all
the
soldiers
had
left
their
shelters
of
boards
and
rubber
blankets
and
were
watching
the
threatening
phenomenon
with
a
grave
fixedness
of
expression
which
showed
that
they
fully
appreciated
its
deadly
significance
of
the
desert
of
the
ocean
are
a
less
impressive
spectacle
than
the
approaching
dust
of
a
hostile
army
the
old
and
tried
soldier
knows
all
that
it
means
he
knows
how
tremendous
will
be
the
screech
of
the
shells
and
the
ghastliness
of
the
wounds
he
faces
it
with
an
inward
shrinking
although
with
a
calm
determination
to
do
his
duty
his
time
for
elation
will
not
come
until
his
blood
is
heated
by
fighting
and
he
joins
in
the
yell
of
the
charge
the
recruit
deeply
moved
by
the
novelty
of
the
sight
and
the
unknown
grandeur
of
horror
or
of
glory
which
it
presages
is
either
vaguely
terrified
or
full
of
excitement
calm
as
is
the
exterior
of
most
men
in
view
of
approaching
battle
not
one
of
them
looks
upon
it
with
entire
indifference
but
let
the
eyes
on
the
fortifications
strain
as
they
might
no
lines
of
troops
could
be
distinguished
and
there
was
little
if
any
increase
in
the
number
of
the
rebel
pickets
who
sat
sentinel
in
their
saddles
under
the
shade
of
scattered
trees
and
houses
presently
the
murmur
a
flag
of
truce
ran
along
the
line
of
spectators
down
the
road
which
skirted
the
northern
bank
of
the
bayou
rode
slowly
amidst
a
little
cloud
of
dust
a
party
of
four
horsemen
one
of
whom
carried
a
white
flag
what
does
that
mean
asked
gazaway
do
you
think
peace
is
proclaimed
it
means
that
they
want
this
fort
said
colburne
they
are
going
to
commit
the
impertinence
of
asking
us
to
surrender
the
major
aquiline
visage
was
very
pale
and
his
outstretched
hand
shook
visibly
he
was
evidently
seized
by
the
complaint
which
had
so
troubled
him
at
port
hudson
cap
what
shall
i
do
he
inquired
in
a
confidential
whisper
twisting
one
of
his
tremulous
fingers
into
colburne
buttonhole
and
drawing
him
aside
tell
them
to
go
to
and
then
send
them
there
said
the
captain
angrily
perceiving
that
gazaway
feelings
inclined
toward
a
capitulation
send
out
an
officer
and
escort
to
meet
the
fellows
and
bring
in
their
message
they
must
be
allowed
to
come
inside
no
no
of
course
not
we
could
git
very
good
terms
if
they
should
see
how
few
we
be
returned
the
major
unable
to
see
the
matter
in
any
other
light
than
that
of
his
own
terrors
well
cap
you
go
and
meet
the
feller
no
you
stay
here
i
want
to
talk
to
you
here
where
that
louisianny
lieutenant
oh
lieutenant
you
go
out
to
that
feller
with
jest
as
many
men
he
got
stop
him
soon
you
git
to
him
and
send
in
his
business
send
it
in
by
one
of
your
men
you
know
and
take
a
white
flag
or
or
suthin
when
gazaway
was
in
a
perturbed
state
of
mind
his
conversation
had
an
unusual
twang
of
the
provincialisms
of
tone
and
grammar
amidst
which
he
had
been
educated
or
rather
had
grown
up
without
an
education
at
sight
of
the
union
flag
of
truce
the
rebel
one
now
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
fort
halted
under
the
shadow
of
an
evergreen
oak
by
the
roadside
after
a
parley
of
a
few
minutes
the
louisiana
lieutenant
returned
beaded
with
perspiration
and
delivered
to
gazaway
a
sealed
envelope
the
latter
opened
it
with
fingers
which
worked
as
awkwardly
as
a
pair
of
tongs
read
the
enclosed
note
with
evident
difficulty
cast
a
troubled
eye
up
and
down
the
river
as
if
looking
in
vain
for
help
beckoned
colburne
to
follow
him
and
led
the
way
to
a
deserted
angle
of
the
fort
i
say
cap
he
whispered
we
got
to
surrender
colburne
looked
him
sternly
in
the
face
but
could
not
catch
his
cowardly
eye
take
care
major
he
said
gazaway
started
as
if
he
had
been
threatened
with
personal
violence
you
are
a
ruined
man
if
you
surrender
this
fort
pursued
colburne
the
major
writhed
his
herculean
form
and
looked
all
the
anguish
which
so
mean
a
nature
was
capable
of
feeling
for
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
capitulated
he
might
never
be
promoted
and
never
go
to
congress
what
in
god
name
shall
i
do
he
implored
they
got
six
men
call
the
officers
together
and
put
it
to
vote
well
you
fetch
cap
i
swear
i
too
sick
to
stan
up
down
he
sat
in
the
dust
resting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
between
his
hands
colburne
sought
out
the
officers
seven
in
number
besides
himself
and
all
as
it
chanced
lieutenants
gentlemen
he
said
we
are
dishonored
cowards
if
we
surrender
this
fort
without
fighting
dam
if
we
do
have
the
biggest
kind
of
a
scrimmage
first
returned
the
louisianian
the
afflicted
gazaway
rose
to
receive
them
opened
the
communication
of
the
rebel
general
dropped
it
picked
it
up
and
handed
it
to
colburne
saying
cap
you
read
it
it
was
a
polite
summons
to
surrender
stating
the
investing
force
at
six
thousand
men
declaring
that
the
success
of
an
assault
was
certain
offering
to
send
the
garrison
on
parole
to
new
orleans
and
closing
with
the
hope
that
the
commandant
of
the
fort
would
avoid
a
useless
effusion
of
blood
now
them
what
i
call
terms
broke
in
gazaway
eagerly
we
ca
git
no
better
if
we
fight
a
week
and
we
ca
fight
a
day
we
hai
got
the
men
to
whip
six
texans
i
go
for
takin
terms
while
we
can
git
gentlemen
i
go
for
fighting
said
colburne
that
me
responded
the
louisiana
lieutenant
and
there
was
an
approving
murmur
from
the
other
officers
this
fort
continued
our
captain
is
an
absolute
necessity
to
the
prosecution
of
the
siege
of
port
hudson
if
it
is
lost
the
navigation
of
the
river
is
interrupted
and
our
army
is
cut
off
from
its
supplies
if
we
surrender
we
make
the
whole
campaign
a
failure
we
must
not
do
it
we
never
shall
be
able
to
face
our
comrades
after
it
we
never
shall
be
able
to
look
loyal
man
or
rebel
in
the
eye
we
defend
ourselves
general
banks
has
been
repulsed
twice
from
inferior
works
it
is
an
easy
chance
to
do
a
great
deed
to
deserve
the
thanks
of
the
army
and
the
whole
country
just
consider
too
that
if
we
do
hold
the
fort
we
may
be
called
on
some
day
to
storm
it
which
is
the
easiest
gentlemen
i
say
no
surrender
every
officer
but
gazaway
answered
that
my
vote
the
louisiana
lieutenant
fingered
his
revolver
threatening
and
swore
by
all
that
was
holy
or
infernal
that
he
would
shoot
the
first
man
who
talked
of
capitulating
gazaway
mouth
had
opened
to
gurgle
a
remonstrance
but
at
this
threat
he
remained
silent
and
gasping
like
a
stranded
fish
well
cap
you
write
an
answer
to
the
cuss
and
the
major
sign
it
said
the
louisianian
to
colburne
with
a
grin
of
humorous
malignity
our
friend
ran
to
the
office
of
the
quartermaster
and
returned
in
a
minute
with
the
following
epistle
sir
it
is
my
duty
to
defend
fort
winthrop
to
the
last
extremity
and
i
shall
do
it
the
signature
which
the
major
appended
to
this
heroic
document
was
so
tremulous
and
illegible
that
the
rebel
general
must
have
thought
that
the
commandant
was
either
very
illiterate
or
else
a
very
old
gentleman
afflicted
with
the
palsy
thus
did
the
unhappy
gazaway
have
greatness
thrust
upon
him
he
would
have
been
indignant
had
he
not
been
so
terrified
he
thought
of
colburne
some
day
for
insubordination
but
said
nothing
of
it
at
present
he
was
fully
occupied
with
searching
the
fort
for
a
place
which
promised
shelter
from
shell
and
bullet
the
rest
of
the
day
he
spent
chiefly
on
the
river
front
looking
up
and
down
the
stream
in
vain
for
the
friendly
smoke
of
gunboats
and
careful
all
the
while
to
keep
his
head
below
the
level
of
the
ramparts
his
trepidation
was
so
apparent
that
the
common
soldiers
discovered
it
and
amused
themselves
by
slyly
jerking
bullets
at
him
in
order
to
see
him
jump
fall
down
and
clap
his
hand
to
the
part
hit
by
the
harmless
missile
he
must
have
suspected
the
trick
but
he
did
not
threaten
vengeance
nor
even
try
to
discover
the
jokers
every
feeble
source
of
manliness
in
him
had
been
dried
up
by
his
terrors
he
gave
no
orders
exacted
no
obedience
and
would
have
received
none
had
he
demanded
it
late
in
the
afternoon
half
a
dozen
veritable
rebel
balls
whistling
over
the
fort
sent
him
cowering
into
the
room
occupied
by
carter
where
he
appropriated
a
blanket
and
stretched
himself
at
full
length
on
the
floor
fairly
grovelling
and
flattening
in
search
of
safety
it
was
a
case
of
cowardice
which
bordered
upon
mania
or
physical
disease
he
had
just
manliness
enough
to
feel
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
and
mutter
to
carter
that
he
was
too
sick
to
stan
up
even
she
novel
as
she
was
to
the
situation
understood
him
after
a
little
study
and
the
sight
of
his
degrading
alarm
instead
of
striking
her
with
a
panic
roused
her
pride
and
her
courage
with
what
an
admiring
contrast
of
feeling
she
looked
at
the
brave
colburne
and
thought
of
her
brave
husband
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
showed
no
sign
of
an
enemy
except
the
wide
thin
semicircle
of
rebel
pickets
quiet
but
watchful
which
stretched
across
the
bayou
from
the
river
above
to
the
river
below
as
night
deepened
the
vigilance
of
the
garrison
increased
and
not
only
the
sentinels
but
every
soldier
was
behind
the
ramparts
each
officer
remaining
in
rear
of
his
own
company
or
platoon
ready
to
direct
it
and
lead
it
at
the
first
alarm
colburne
who
was
tacitly
recognized
as
made
the
rounds
every
hour
about
midnight
a
murmur
of
joy
ran
from
bastion
to
bastion
as
the
news
spread
that
two
steamers
were
close
at
hand
coming
up
the
river
presently
every
one
could
see
their
glowing
like
fireflies
in
the
distant
and
hear
through
the
breathless
night
the
sighing
of
the
steam
the
moaning
of
the
machinery
and
at
last
the
swash
of
water
against
the
bows
the
low
black
hulks
and
short
delicate
masts
distinctly
visible
on
the
gleaming
groundwork
of
the
river
and
against
the
faintly
lighted
horizon
showed
that
they
were
gunboats
and
the
metallic
rattle
of
their
cables
as
they
came
to
anchor
opposite
the
fort
proved
that
they
had
arrived
to
take
part
in
the
approaching
struggle
even
gazaway
crawled
out
of
his
asylum
to
look
at
the
cheering
reinforcement
and
assumed
something
of
his
native
pomposity
as
he
observed
to
colburne
cap
they
wo
dare
to
pitch
into
us
with
them
fellers
alongside
a
bullet
or
two
from
the
rebel
sharpshooters
posted
on
the
southern
side
of
the
bayou
sent
him
back
to
his
house
of
refuge
he
thought
the
assault
was
about
to
commence
and
was
entirely
absorbed
in
hearkening
for
its
opening
clamor
when
carter
asked
him
what
was
going
on
he
made
her
no
answer
he
was
listening
with
all
his
pores
his
very
hair
stood
on
end
to
listen
presently
he
stretched
himself
upon
the
floor
in
an
instinctive
effort
to
escape
a
spattering
of
musketry
which
broke
through
the
sultry
stillness
of
the
night
a
black
speck
had
slid
around
the
stern
of
one
of
the
gunboats
and
was
making
for
the
bank
saluted
by
quick
spittings
of
fire
from
the
levee
above
and
below
the
junction
of
the
bayou
with
the
river
in
reply
similar
fiery
spittings
scintillated
from
the
dark
mass
of
the
fort
and
there
was
a
rapid
of
invisible
missiles
a
cutter
was
coming
ashore
the
rebel
pickets
were
firing
upon
it
the
garrison
was
firing
upon
the
pickets
the
pickets
upon
the
garrison
the
red
flashes
and
irregular
rattle
lasted
until
the
cutter
had
completed
its
return
voyage
there
was
an
understanding
now
between
the
little
navy
and
the
little
army
the
gunboats
knew
where
to
direct
their
cannonade
so
as
best
to
support
the
garrison
and
the
soldiers
were
full
of
confidence
although
they
did
not
relax
their
vigilance
doctor
ravenel
and
carter
supposed
in
their
civilian
inexperience
that
all
danger
was
over
and
by
two
in
the
morning
were
fast
asleep
chapter
xxiv
a
desperate
attack
and
a
successful
defence
while
it
was
still
darkness
lillie
was
awakened
from
her
sleep
by
an
startling
savage
uproar
through
the
hot
night
came
tramplings
and
yellings
of
a
rebel
brigade
roaring
of
and
whirring
of
grape
from
the
bastions
of
the
fort
roaring
of
and
flight
of
shrieking
cracking
flashing
shells
from
the
gunboats
incessant
spattering
and
fiery
spitting
of
musketry
with
whistling
and
humming
of
bullets
and
constant
through
all
the
demoniac
yell
advancing
like
the
howl
of
an
infernal
tide
bedlam
pandemonium
all
the
maniacs
of
earth
and
all
the
fiends
of
hell
seemed
to
have
combined
in
riot
amidst
the
crashings
of
storm
and
volcano
the
clamor
came
with
the
suddenness
and
continued
with
more
than
the
rage
of
a
tornado
lillie
had
never
imagined
anything
so
unearthly
and
horrible
she
called
loudly
for
her
father
and
was
positively
astonished
to
hear
his
voice
close
at
her
side
so
strangely
did
the
familiar
tones
sound
in
that
brutal
uproar
what
is
it
she
asked
it
must
be
the
assault
he
replied
astonished
into
telling
the
alarming
truth
i
will
step
out
and
take
a
look
you
shall
not
she
exclaimed
clutching
him
what
if
you
should
be
hit
my
dear
do
be
childish
remonstrated
the
doctor
it
is
my
duty
to
attend
to
the
wounded
i
am
the
only
surgeon
in
the
fort
just
consider
the
ingratitude
of
neglecting
these
brave
fellows
who
are
fighting
for
our
safety
will
you
promise
not
to
get
hurt
certainly
my
dear
will
you
come
back
every
five
minutes
and
let
me
see
you
yes
my
dear
i
keep
you
informed
of
everything
that
happens
she
thought
a
few
moments
and
gradually
loosened
her
hold
on
him
her
curiosity
her
anxiety
to
know
how
this
terrible
drama
went
on
helped
her
to
be
brave
and
to
spare
him
as
soon
as
her
fingers
had
unclosed
from
his
sleeve
he
crept
to
where
his
rifle
stood
and
softly
seized
it
and
in
so
doing
he
stepped
on
the
recumbent
gazaway
who
groaned
whereupon
the
doctor
politely
apologized
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
building
he
distinguished
colburne
voice
on
the
river
front
shouting
this
way
men
in
that
direction
ran
the
doctor
holding
his
rifle
in
both
hands
at
something
like
the
position
of
a
charge
bayonet
with
his
thumb
on
the
trigger
so
as
to
be
ready
for
immediate
conflict
suddenly
bang
went
the
piece
at
an
angle
of
degrees
sending
its
ball
clean
across
the
mississippi
and
causing
a
veteran
sergeant
near
him
to
inquire
what
the
hell
he
was
about
really
that
explosion
was
quite
extraordinary
said
the
surprised
doctor
i
had
not
the
least
intention
of
firing
would
you
sir
have
the
goodness
to
load
it
for
me
but
the
sergeant
was
in
a
hurry
and
ran
on
without
answering
the
doctor
began
to
finger
his
in
a
wild
way
intending
to
get
out
a
cartridge
if
he
could
when
a
faint
voice
near
him
said
load
your
gun
for
you
sir
you
be
so
kind
replied
the
doctor
delighted
i
am
so
dreadfully
inexperienced
in
these
operations
i
am
quite
sorry
to
trouble
you
the
sick
man
one
of
the
invalids
whom
gazaway
had
brought
from
new
orleans
loaded
the
piece
capped
it
and
added
some
brief
instructions
in
the
mysteries
of
and
really
you
are
very
good
i
am
quite
obliged
said
the
doctor
and
hurried
on
to
the
river
front
guided
by
the
voice
of
colburne
at
the
rampart
he
tried
to
shoot
one
of
our
men
who
was
coming
up
wounded
from
the
palisade
and
would
probably
have
succeeded
but
that
the
lock
of
his
gun
would
not
work
colburne
stopped
him
in
this
but
mistaken
labor
saying
those
are
our
people
then
your
gun
is
at
now
keep
your
finger
off
the
trigger
until
you
see
a
rebel
then
shouting
forward
men
he
ran
down
to
the
palisade
followed
by
twenty
or
thirty
of
whom
one
was
the
doctor
the
assailing
brigade
debouching
from
the
woods
half
a
mile
away
from
the
front
had
advanced
in
a
wide
front
across
the
flat
losing
scarcely
any
men
by
the
fire
of
the
artillery
although
many
shaken
by
the
horrible
screeching
of
the
shells
threw
themselves
on
the
ground
in
the
darkness
or
sought
the
frail
shelter
of
the
scattered
dwellings
thus
diminished
in
numbers
and
broken
up
by
night
and
obstacles
and
the
differing
speed
of
running
men
the
brigade
reached
the
fort
not
an
organization
but
a
confused
swarm
flowing
along
the
edge
of
the
ditch
to
right
and
left
in
search
of
an
entrance
there
was
a
constant
spattering
of
flashes
as
individuals
returned
the
steady
fire
of
the
garrison
and
the
sharp
clean
whistle
of
round
bullets
and
buckshot
mingled
in
the
thick
warm
air
with
the
hoarse
whiz
of
minies
now
and
then
an
angry
shout
or
wailing
scream
indicated
that
some
one
had
been
hit
and
mangled
the
exhortations
and
oaths
of
the
rebel
officers
could
be
distinctly
heard
as
they
endeavored
to
restore
order
to
drive
up
stragglers
and
to
urge
the
mass
forward
a
few
jumped
or
fell
into
the
ditch
and
floundered
there
unable
to
climb
up
the
smooth
facings
of
brickwork
two
or
three
hundred
collected
around
the
palisade
which
connected
the
northern
front
with
the
river
some
lying
down
and
waiting
and
others
firing
at
the
woodwork
or
the
neighboring
ramparts
while
a
few
determined
ones
tried
to
burst
open
the
gate
by
main
strength
the
doctor
put
the
whole
length
of
his
barrel
through
one
of
the
narrow
port
holes
of
the
palisade
and
immediately
became
aware
that
some
on
the
outside
had
seized
it
and
was
pulling
downwards
let
go
of
my
gun
he
shouted
instinctively
without
considering
the
unreasonable
nature
of
the
request
let
go
yourself
you
son
of
a
bitch
returned
the
outsider
not
a
whit
more
rational
the
doctor
pulled
trigger
with
a
sense
of
just
indignation
and
drew
in
his
gun
the
barrel
bent
at
a
right
angle
and
bursted
whether
he
had
injured
the
rebel
or
only
startled
him
into
letting
go
his
hold
he
never
knew
and
did
not
then
pause
to
consider
he
felt
his
ruined
weapon
all
over
with
his
hands
tried
in
vain
to
draw
the
ramrod
and
after
bringing
all
his
philosophical
acumen
to
bear
on
the
subject
gave
up
the
idea
of
reloading
casting
about
for
a
new
armament
he
observed
behind
him
a
man
lying
in
one
of
the
many
little
gullies
which
seemed
to
slope
between
the
fort
and
the
river
his
eyes
wide
open
and
fixed
upon
the
palisade
and
his
right
hand
loosely
holding
a
rifle
the
doctor
concluded
that
he
was
sick
or
tired
or
seeking
shelter
from
the
bullets
would
you
be
good
enough
to
lend
me
your
gun
for
a
few
moments
he
inquired
the
man
made
no
reply
he
was
perfectly
dead
the
doctor
being
and
without
his
spectacles
and
not
accustomed
as
yet
to
appreciating
the
effects
of
musketry
did
not
suspect
this
until
he
bent
over
him
and
saw
that
his
woolen
shirt
was
soaked
with
blood
he
picked
up
the
rifle
guessed
that
it
was
loaded
stumbled
back
to
the
palisade
insinuated
the
mere
muzzle
into
a
and
fired
with
splintering
effect
on
the
woodwork
the
explosion
was
followed
by
a
howl
of
anguish
from
the
exterior
which
gave
him
a
mighty
throb
partly
of
horror
and
partly
of
loyal
satisfaction
after
all
it
is
only
a
species
of
surgical
operation
he
thought
and
proceeded
to
reload
according
to
the
best
of
his
speed
and
knowledge
suddenly
he
staggered
under
a
violent
impulse
precisely
as
if
a
strong
man
had
jerked
him
by
the
and
putting
his
hand
to
the
spot
he
found
that
a
bullet
nearly
spent
in
penetrating
the
palisades
had
punched
its
way
through
the
cloth
this
was
the
nearest
approach
to
a
wound
that
he
received
during
the
engagement
meantime
things
were
going
badly
with
the
assailants
disorganized
by
the
night
cut
up
by
the
musketry
demoralized
by
the
incessant
screaming
and
bursting
of
the
shells
unable
to
force
the
palisade
or
cross
the
ditch
they
rapidly
lost
heart
threw
themselves
on
the
earth
took
refuge
behind
the
levees
dropped
away
in
squads
through
the
covering
gloom
and
were
in
short
repulsed
in
the
course
of
thirty
minutes
all
that
yelling
swarm
had
disappeared
except
the
thickly
scattered
dead
and
wounded
and
a
few
stragglers
who
continued
to
fire
as
sharpshooters
we
have
whipped
them
shouted
colburne
hurrah
for
the
old
flag
the
garrison
caught
the
impulse
of
enthusiasm
and
raised
yell
on
yell
of
triumph
even
the
wounded
ceased
to
feel
their
anguish
for
a
moment
and
uttered
a
feeble
shout
or
exclamation
of
gladness
the
doctor
bethought
himself
of
his
daughter
and
hurried
back
to
the
brick
building
to
inform
her
of
the
victory
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
with
a
shriek
of
delight
and
almost
in
the
same
breath
reproached
him
sharply
for
leaving
her
so
long
my
dear
it
ca
be
more
than
five
minutes
said
the
doctor
fully
believing
what
he
said
so
rapidly
does
time
pass
in
the
excitement
of
successful
battle
is
it
really
over
she
asked
quite
so
they
are
rushing
for
the
woods
like
pelted
frogs
for
a
puddle
they
are
going
in
all
directions
as
though
they
were
bound
for
cowes
and
a
market
i
do
believe
they
will
ever
get
together
again
we
have
gained
a
magnificent
victory
it
is
the
grandest
moment
of
my
life
is
captain
colburne
unhurt
was
lillie
next
question
perfectly
we
have
lost
a
man
except
one
he
added
bethinking
himself
of
the
poor
fellow
whose
gun
he
had
borrowed
oh
she
sighed
with
a
long
inspiration
of
relief
for
the
life
of
her
brave
defender
had
become
precious
in
her
eyes
the
doctor
had
brought
his
rifle
into
the
room
and
was
much
troubled
with
it
not
caring
to
shock
lillie
with
the
fact
that
he
had
been
personally
engaged
he
held
it
behind
his
back
with
one
hand
after
the
manner
of
a
naughty
boy
who
has
been
nearly
detected
in
breaking
windows
and
who
still
has
a
brickbat
in
his
fist
which
he
dares
not
show
and
can
not
find
a
chance
to
hide
he
was
slyly
setting
it
against
the
wall
when
she
discovered
it
what
she
exclaimed
have
you
been
fighting
too
you
dear
darling
wicked
papa
she
kissed
him
violently
and
then
laughed
hysterically
i
thought
you
were
up
to
some
mischief
all
the
while
she
added
you
were
gone
a
dreadful
time
and
i
screaming
and
looking
out
for
you
papa
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
i
have
reason
to
be
i
am
the
most
disgraceful
ignoramus
i
do
know
how
to
load
my
gun
i
think
i
must
have
put
the
bullet
in
wrong
end
first
the
ramrod
wo
go
down
well
put
it
away
now
you
do
want
it
any
more
you
must
take
care
of
the
wounded
wounded
exclaimed
the
doctor
are
there
any
wounded
oh
dear
several
of
them
i
forgot
to
tell
you
they
are
to
bring
them
in
here
i
am
going
to
our
trunks
to
get
some
linen
the
doctor
was
quite
astonished
to
find
that
there
were
a
number
of
wounded
for
having
escaped
unhurt
himself
he
concluded
that
every
one
else
had
been
equally
lucky
excepting
of
course
the
man
who
lay
dead
in
the
gulley
as
he
laid
down
his
gun
he
heard
a
groaning
in
one
corner
and
went
softly
towards
it
expecting
to
find
one
of
the
victims
of
the
conflict
lifting
up
one
end
of
a
blanket
and
lighting
a
match
to
dispel
the
dimness
he
beheld
the
prostrate
gazaway
his
face
beaded
with
the
perspiration
of
heat
and
terror
oh
said
the
doctor
with
perhaps
the
merest
twang
of
contempt
in
the
exclamation
my
god
doctor
groaned
the
major
i
tell
you
i
a
sick
man
got
the
most
awful
bilious
colic
that
ever
a
feller
had
if
you
can
give
me
something
do
for
god
sake
presently
answered
ravenel
and
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
if
i
could
have
discharged
my
gun
he
afterwards
said
in
relating
the
circumstance
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
rid
him
of
his
bilious
colic
by
a
surgical
operation
the
floor
of
the
little
building
was
soon
cumbered
with
half
a
dozen
injured
men
and
dampened
with
their
blood
the
doctor
had
no
instruments
but
he
could
probe
with
his
finger
and
dress
with
wet
bandages
lillie
aided
him
pale
at
the
sight
of
blood
and
suffering
but
resolute
to
do
what
she
could
when
colburne
looked
in
for
a
moment
she
nodded
to
him
with
a
sweet
smile
which
was
meant
to
thank
him
for
having
defended
her
i
am
glad
to
see
you
at
this
work
he
said
there
will
be
more
of
it
what
more
fighting
exclaimed
the
doctor
looking
up
from
a
shattered
finger
oh
yes
we
must
hope
that
they
will
be
satisfied
with
one
assault
there
is
a
supporting
column
of
course
and
it
will
come
on
soon
but
do
you
stay
here
whatever
happens
you
will
be
of
most
use
here
he
had
scarcely
disappeared
when
the
whole
air
became
horribly
vocal
as
with
a
screaming
the
second
brigade
of
texans
moved
to
the
assault
and
the
thunders
of
fort
and
fleet
replied
taking
the
same
direction
as
before
but
pushing
forward
with
superior
solidity
and
energy
the
living
wave
swept
up
to
the
fortifications
howled
along
the
course
of
the
ditch
and
surged
clamorously
against
the
palisade
colburne
was
there
with
half
the
other
officers
and
half
the
strength
of
the
garrison
silent
for
the
most
part
but
fighting
desperately
suddenly
there
was
a
shout
of
back
back
they
are
coming
round
the
palisade
there
was
a
stumbling
rush
for
the
cover
of
the
fortification
proper
and
there
the
last
possible
line
of
defence
was
established
instinctively
and
in
a
moment
officers
and
men
dropped
on
their
knees
behind
the
low
bank
of
earth
and
continued
an
irregular
deliberate
fire
each
discharging
his
piece
as
fast
as
he
could
load
and
aim
the
garrison
was
not
sufficient
to
form
a
continuous
rank
along
even
this
single
front
and
on
such
portions
of
the
works
as
were
protected
by
the
ditch
the
soldiers
were
scattered
almost
as
sparsely
as
sentinels
nothing
saved
the
place
from
being
carried
by
assault
except
the
fact
that
the
assailants
were
unprovided
with
scaling
ladders
the
adventurous
fellows
who
had
flanked
the
palisade
rushed
to
the
gate
and
gave
entrance
to
a
torrent
of
tall
lank
men
in
butternut
or
dirty
grey
clothing
their
bronzed
faces
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
supposed
victory
and
their
yells
of
exultation
drowning
for
a
minute
the
sharp
outcries
of
the
wounded
and
the
rattle
of
the
musketry
but
the
human
billow
was
met
by
such
a
fatal
discharge
that
it
could
not
come
over
the
rampart
the
foremost
dead
fell
across
it
and
the
mass
reeled
backward
unfortunately
for
the
attack
the
exterior
slope
was
full
of
small
knolls
and
gullies
beside
being
cumbered
with
rude
shanties
of
four
or
five
feet
in
height
made
of
bits
of
board
and
shelter
tents
which
had
served
as
the
quarters
of
the
garrison
behind
these
covers
scores
if
not
hundreds
sought
refuge
and
could
not
be
induced
to
leave
them
for
a
second
charge
they
commenced
with
musketry
and
from
that
moment
the
great
peril
was
over
the
men
behind
the
rampart
had
only
to
lie
quiet
to
shoot
every
one
who
approached
or
rose
at
full
length
and
to
wait
till
daylight
should
enable
the
gunboats
to
open
with
grape
in
vain
the
rebel
officers
foreseeing
this
danger
strove
with
voice
and
example
to
raise
a
yell
and
a
rush
the
impetuosity
of
the
attack
had
died
out
and
could
not
be
brought
to
life
they
do
like
the
way
it
works
laughed
the
louisiana
lieutenant
in
high
glee
they
ai
on
it
so
much
as
they
was
for
an
hour
the
exchange
of
close
musketry
continued
the
strength
of
the
assailants
steadily
decreasing
as
some
fell
wounded
or
dead
and
others
stole
out
of
the
fatal
enclosure
daylight
showed
more
than
a
hundred
fallen
and
nearly
two
hundred
unharmed
men
all
lying
or
crouching
among
the
irregularities
of
that
bloody
and
glacis
several
voices
cried
out
stop
firing
we
surrender
an
officer
in
a
uniform
repeated
these
words
waving
a
white
handkerchief
then
rising
from
his
refuge
he
walked
up
to
the
rampart
leaped
upon
it
and
stared
in
amazement
at
the
thin
line
of
defenders
soldiers
and
negroes
intermingled
by
i
wo
surrender
to
such
a
handful
he
exclaimed
come
on
boys
a
sergeant
immediately
shot
him
through
the
breast
and
his
body
fell
inside
of
the
works
not
a
man
of
those
whom
he
had
appealed
to
followed
him
and
only
a
few
rose
from
their
covers
to
crouch
again
as
soon
as
they
witnessed
his
fate
the
fire
of
the
garrison
reopened
with
violence
and
soon
there
were
new
cries
of
we
surrender
with
a
waving
of
hats
and
handkerchiefs
what
shall
we
do
asked
the
louisiana
lieutenant
they
are
three
to
our
one
if
we
let
the
d
n
scoundrels
in
they
will
knock
us
down
and
take
our
guns
away
from
us
colburne
rose
and
called
out
do
you
surrender
yes
yes
from
many
voices
and
a
frantic
agitation
of
broadbrims
then
throw
your
arms
into
the
river
first
one
then
another
then
several
together
obeyed
this
order
until
there
was
a
general
rush
to
the
bank
and
a
prodigious
splashing
of
guns
and
in
the
yellow
water
now
sit
down
and
keep
quiet
was
colburne
next
command
they
obeyed
with
the
utmost
composure
some
filled
their
pipes
and
fell
to
smoking
others
produced
from
their
havresacks
and
breakfasted
others
busied
themselves
with
propping
the
wounded
and
bringing
them
water
quite
a
number
crawled
into
the
deserted
shanties
and
went
to
sleep
apparently
worn
out
with
the
night
work
and
watching
a
low
murmur
of
conversation
chiefly
concerning
the
events
of
the
assault
and
not
specially
gloomy
in
its
tenor
gradually
mingled
with
the
groans
of
the
wounded
when
the
gate
of
the
palisade
was
closed
upon
them
and
refastened
they
laughed
a
little
at
the
idea
of
being
shut
up
in
a
pen
like
so
many
chickens
trapped
by
jiminy
said
one
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
do
know
how
to
behave
myself
i
never
was
cotched
before
i
a
wild
man
of
the
prairies
i
am
on
all
sides
the
attack
had
failed
with
heavy
loss
to
the
assailants
the
heroic
little
garrison
scarcely
one
hundred
and
fifty
strong
including
officers
and
negroes
all
of
whom
had
fought
had
captured
more
than
its
own
numbers
and
killed
and
wounded
twice
its
own
numbers
the
fragments
of
the
repulsed
brigades
had
fallen
back
beyond
the
range
of
fire
and
even
the
semicircle
of
pickets
had
almost
disappeared
in
the
woods
the
prisoners
and
wounded
were
taken
on
board
the
gunboats
and
forwarded
to
new
orleans
by
the
first
transport
down
the
river
as
the
last
of
the
unfortunates
left
the
shore
colburne
remarked
i
wonder
if
those
poor
fellows
will
ever
get
tired
of
fighting
for
an
institution
which
only
prolongs
their
own
inferiority
i
am
afraid
not
i
am
afraid
not
said
the
doctor
not
at
least
until
they
are
whipped
into
reason
they
have
been
educated
under
an
awful
tyranny
of
prejudice
conceit
and
ignorance
they
are
more
incapable
of
perceiving
their
own
true
interests
than
so
many
brutes
i
have
had
the
honor
to
be
acquainted
with
dogs
who
were
their
superiors
in
that
respect
in
tennessee
on
one
of
my
excursions
i
stopped
over
night
in
the
of
a
farmer
it
was
rather
chilly
and
i
wanted
to
poke
the
fire
there
was
no
poker
said
the
farmer
has
run
off
with
the
poker
again
he
went
out
for
a
moment
and
came
in
with
the
article
i
asked
him
if
his
dog
had
a
fancy
for
pokers
said
he
one
of
my
boys
once
burnt
the
critter
nose
with
a
hot
poker
and
ever
since
then
he
hides
it
every
time
that
he
comes
across
it
we
know
whar
to
find
it
he
allays
puts
it
under
the
house
and
kivers
it
up
with
leaves
it
curious
said
he
watch
him
go
at
it
snuffing
to
see
if
it
is
hot
and
picking
it
up
and
sidling
off
as
sly
as
a
he
has
an
awful
bad
conscience
about
it
perhaps
you
noticed
that
when
you
asked
for
the
poker
bose
he
got
up
and
travelled
now
you
see
the
dog
knew
what
had
burned
him
but
these
poor
besotted
creatures
do
know
that
it
is
slavery
which
has
scorched
their
stupid
noses
they
have
no
idea
of
getting
rid
of
their
hot
poker
they
are
fighting
to
keep
it
when
it
had
become
certain
that
the
fighting
was
quite
over
major
gazaway
reappeared
in

the

i
shall
be
forgiven
i
presume
for
not
reporting
back
to
the

such
was
the
defence
of
fort
winthrop
one
of
the
most
gallant
feats
of
the
war
those
days
are
gone
by
and
there
will
be
no
more
like
them
forever
at
least
not
in
our
forever
not
very
long
ago
not
more
than
two
hours
before
this
ink
dried
upon
the
paper
the
author
of
the
present
history
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
basaltic
cliff
which
overlooked
a
wide
expanse
of
fertile
earth
flourishing
villages
the
spires
of
a
city
and
beyond
a
shining
sea
flecked
with
the
sails
of
peace
and
prosperity
from
the
face
of
another
basaltic
cliff
two
miles
distant
he
saw
a
white
globule
of
smoke
dart
a
little
way
upward
and
a
minute
afterwards
heard
a
dull
deep
of
exploding
gunpowder
quarrymen
there
were
blasting
out
rocks
from
which
to
build
hives
of
industry
and
happy
family
homes
but
the
sound
reminded
him
of
the
roar
of
artillery
of
the
thunder
of
those
signal
guns
which
used
to
presage
battle
of
the
alarums
which
only
a
few
months
previous
were
a
command
to
him
to
mount
and
ride
into
the
combat
then
he
thought
almost
with
a
feeling
of
sadness
so
strange
is
the
human
heart
that
he
had
probably
heard
those
clamors
uttered
in
mortal
earnest
for
the
last
time
never
again
perhaps
even
should
he
live
to
the
age
of
threescore
and
ten
would
the
shriek
of
grapeshot
and
the
crash
of
shell
and
the
multitudinous
whiz
of
musketry
be
a
part
of
his
life
nevermore
would
he
hearken
to
that
charging
yell
which
once
had
stirred
his
blood
more
fiercely
than
the
sound
of
trumpets
the
southern
full
of
howls
and
yelpings
as
of
brute
beasts
rushing
hilariously
to
the
fray
the
northern
yell
all
human
but
none
the
less
relentless
and
stern
nevermore
the
one
nor
the
other
no
more
charges
of
cavalry
rushing
through
the
dust
of
the
distance
no
more
answering
smoke
of
musketry
veiling
unshaken
lines
and
squares
no
more
columns
of
smoke
piling
high
above
deafening
batteries
no
more
groans
of
wounded
nor
shouts
of
victors
over
positions
carried
and
banners
captured
nor
reports
of
triumphs
which
saved
a
nation
from
disappearing
off
the
face
of
the
earth
after
thinking
of
these
things
for
an
hour
together
almost
sadly
as
i
have
said
he
walked
back
to
his
home
and
read
with
interest
a
paper
which
prattled
of
town
elections
and
advertised
for
sale
and
decided
to
make
a
call
in
the
evening
and
to
go
to
church
on
the
morrow

in

of

circumstances
when
colburne
reached
port
hudson
it
had
capitulated
the
stars
and
stripes
were
flying
in
place
of
the
stars
and
bars
with
a
smile
of
triumph
he
climbed
the
steep
path
which
up
the
almost
precipitous
breast
earth
changing
into
stone
of
the
gigantic
bluff
which
formed
the
river
front
of
the
fortress
at
the
summit
was
a
plateau
of
nearly
of
a
mile
in
diameter
verdant
with
turf
and
groves
and
pleasantly
rolling
in
surface
he
had
never
been
here
before
he
and
twelve
thousand
others
had
tried
to
come
here
on
the
of
may
but
had
failed
and
he
paused
to
take
a
long
look
at
the
spot
and
its
surroundings
not
a
sign
of
fortification
was
visible
except
five
or
six
small
of
earth
at
different
points
along
the
edge
of
the
bluff
behind
which
were
mounted
as
many
monstrous
guns

some
rifled

shot
from
these
giants

sunk

and
crippled

but
two
in
his
audacious
rush
up
the
river

from
them
had
flown
clean
over
the
bluff
and
sought
out

bursting
with
a
sonorous
hollow
thunder
which
seemed
to

the

lines
of
earthworks
which
had
so
steadily
and
bloodily
repulsed
our

were
all
below
the
line
of
sight

by
the
undulations
of

by

the

torn
and
pitted
by

by

and
half
a

which
constituted

more
or

shattered

bullets

the
union
sharpshooters
had
reached
as
far
as
here
and
had
even
gone
quite
over
and
fallen
into
the
mississippi
a
gaunt
dirty
woman
told
colburne
that
on
the
spot
where
he
stood
a
soldier
of
the
garrison
had
been
killed
by
a
chance
while
drinking
a
glass
of
beer
leaving
his
cicerone
he
joined
a
party
of
officers
who
were
lounging
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
and
inquired
for
the
residence
of
colonel
carter
here
you
are
answered
a
lieutenant
pointing
to
the
nearest
house
can
i
do
any
thing
for
you
captain
i
am
his
aid
i
would
advise
you
to
call
on
him
unless
you
have
something
very
particular
to
say
every
body
has
been
celebrating
the
surrender
and
the
colonel
exactly
in
a
state
for
business
colburne
hesitated
but
he
had
letters
from
carter
wife
and
and
of
course
he
must
see
him
drunk
or
sober
at
that
moment
he
heard
a
voice
that
he
recognized
a
voice
that
had
demanded
and
obtained
what
he
had
not
dared
to
ask
for
a
voice
that
as
he
well
knew
longed
for
as
the
sweetest
of
earth
music
hi
hi
said
the
colonel
making
his
appearance
upon
the
unpainted
warped
paralytic
verandah
of
his
dwelling
through
the
window
from
which
he
issued
could
be
seen
a
sloppy
table
with
bottles
and
glasses
and
the
laughing
faces
of
two
slatternly
girls
the
one
seventeen
the
other
twenty
he
had
on
an
old
fastened
around
his
waist
with
a
and
his
trousers
hung
loose
about
the
heels
of
a
pair
of
dirty
slippers
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
bloodshot
he
was
winking
leering
and
slightly
unsteady
colburne
slunk
behind
a
tree
humiliated
for
his
sake
and
ready
to
rave
or
weep
as
he
thought
of
the
young
wife
to
whom
this
man
mere
name
was
a
comfort
hi
hi
repeated
carter
where
are
all
these
fellows
the
aid
advanced
and
saluted
do
you
want
any
one
colonel
no
no
do
want
any
one
what
for
celebrate
it
alone
man
enough
for
it
presently
catching
the
eye
of
another
officer
he
again
chuckled
hi
hi
the
person
thus
addressed
approached
and
saluted
i
say
observed
the
colonel
i
got
letters
last
night
addressed
general
carter
john
carter
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
hope
it
means
promotion
said
the
officer
colonel
do
you
think
we
shall
go
into
quarters
no
no
no
go
into
quarters
no
go
into
quarters
for
us
played
out
quarters
in
ole
ole
times
after
fought
a
big
battle
used
to
stop
look
out
good
quarters
and
stop
but
now
nix
cum
rouse
the
stop
back
he
reeled
through
the
window
to
sit
down
to
his
whiskey
and
water
amidst
the
laughter
and
rather
scornful
blandishments
of
the
secession
lasses
nevertheless
i
must
see
him
decided
colburne
ask
colonel
carter
he
said
to
an
orderly
if
he
can
receive
captain
colburne
who
brings
letters
and
messages
from
mrs
carter
in
a
minute
the
man
returned
saluted
and
said
the
colonel
sends
his
compliments
and
asks
you
to
walk
in
sir
when
colburne
entered
carter
presence
he
found
him
somewhat
sobered
in
manner
and
although
the
bottles
and
glasses
were
still
on
the
table
the
girls
had
disappeared
captain
sit
down
take
glass
plain
whiskey
were
the
colonel
first
words
good
for
your
arm
good
for
every
thing
glad
you
got
off
without
a
he
would
have
used
the
word
amputation
only
he
knew
that
his
tongue
could
not
manage
it
thank
you
colonel
here
are
two
letters
sir
from
carter
and
the
doctor
just
as
i
was
leaving
when
it
was
too
late
to
write
carter
charged
me
to
say
to
you
that
her
father
had
decided
to
go
at
once
to
new
orleans
so
that
your
letters
must
be
directed
to
her
there
i
understand
answered
carter
slowly
and
with
the
solemnity
of
enforced
sobriety
thank
you
he
broke
open
his
wife
letter
and
glanced
hurriedly
through
it
captain
i
to
you
he
said
you
saved
my
wife
from
ment
she
to
you
you
noble
fellah
i
charge
myself
with
your
pro
it
was
so
painful
to
see
him
struggle
in
that
humiliating
manner
to
appear
sober
that
colburne
cut
short
the
interview
by
pretexting
a
necessity
of
reporting
immediately
to
his
regiment
come
said
carter
all
right
business
the
colonel
although
not
aware
of
the
fact
was
far
advanced
in
the
way
of
the
drunkard
he
had
long
since
passed
the
period
when
it
was
necessary
to
stimulate
his
appetite
for
spirituous
liquors
by
sugar
bitters
and
other
condiments
he
had
lived
through
the
era
of
fancy
drinks
and
entered
the
cycle
of
confirmed
plain
whiskey
at
the
new
orleans
bars
he
did
not
call
for
the
fascinating
mixtures
for
which
those
establishments
are
famous
he
ran
his
mind
eye
wearily
over
the
and
then
said
in
a
slightly
hoarse
give
me
some
plain
whiskey
he
had
swallowed
a
great
deal
of
strong
drink
during
the
siege
and
since
the
surrender
he
had
not
known
a
sober
waking
moment
his
appetite
was
poor
especially
at
breakfast
his
face
was
constantly
flushed
his
body
had
an
appearance
of
being
bloated
and
his
hands
were
tremulous
nevertheless
obedient
to
a
delusion
common
to
men
of
his
habits
he
did
not
consider
himself
a
hard
drinker
he
acknowledged
that
he
got
intoxicated
at
times
and
thoroughly
but
he
thought
not
more
frequently
or
thoroughly
than
the
average
of
good
fellows
he
was
kept
in
countenance
by
a
great
host
of
comrade
inebriates
in
the
old
service
and
in
the
new
in
the
navy
as
well
as
in
the
army
in
high
civilian
position
and
at
the
front
in
short
throughout
almost
every
grade
and
class
of
american
society
he
could
point
to
men
whose
talents
and
public
virtues
the
nation
honors
and
say
they
get
as
drunk
as
i
do
and
as
often
he
could
point
to
such
cases
on
this
side
of
the
water
and
on
the
other
does
anybody
remember
the
orgies
of
the
clari
et
who
gathered
at
boston
to
celebrate
the
obsequies
of
john
quincy
adams
and
at
charleston
to
lament
over
the
remains
of
john
calhoun
does
anybody
remember
the
dinner
speeches
on
board
of
sir
charles
napier
flagship
just
before
the
baltic
fleet
set
out
for
cronstadt
latterly
this
vice
has
increased
upon
us
in
america
thanks
to
the
reaction
against
the
maine
liquor
law
thanks
to
the
war
perhaps
it
is
for
the
best
perhaps
it
is
a
good
thing
that
hundreds
of
leading
americans
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
led
americans
should
be
drunkards
it
may
be
in
some
incomprehensible
manner
for
the
interest
of
humanity
to
my
unenlightened
mind
the
contrary
seems
probable
but
i
am
liable
to
error
and
sober
at
this
moment
of
writing
a
pint
of
whiskey
might
illuminate
me
to
see
behind
the
veil
it
is
wonderful
to
me
a
member
of
the
guzzling
race
that
the
abstemious
latin
nations
have
not
yet
got
the
better
of
us
nothing
can
account
for
it
unless
it
is
that
spiritual
and
intellectual
and
political
tyranny
more
than
counterbalance
the
advantages
of
temperance
boozing
john
bull
and
jonathan
have
kept
an
upper
hand
because
their
geographical
conditions
have
enabled
them
to
remain
free
and
on
their
impregnable
islands
and
separated
quarters
of
the
globe
they
have
besotted
themselves
for
centuries
with
political
impunity
next
day
as
carter
had
promised
he
was
able
to
attend
to
business
his
first
act
was
to
issue
an
order
assigning
captain
colburne
to
his
staff
as
acting
assistant
to
be
obeyed
and
respected
accordingly
when
the
young
officer
reported
for
duty
he
found
the
colonel
sober
but
stern
and
gloomy
with
the
woful
struggle
against
his
maniacal
appetite
and
shaky
in
body
with
the
result
of
the
bygone
debauch
captain
said
he
i
wish
you
would
do
me
the
favor
to
join
my
mess
i
want
a
temperance
man
no
more
whiskey
for
one
while
by
the
way
i
owe
you
so
much
i
never
can
repay
you
for
saving
my
wife
from
those
savages
if
admiration
is
any
reward
you
have
it
my
wife
and
her
father
both
overflow
with
your
praises
colburne
bowed
and
replied
that
he
had
done
no
more
than
his
duty
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
i
am
glad
it
was
you
who
did
it
replied
the
colonel
i
do
know
any
other
person
to
whom
i
would
so
willingly
be
under
such
an
obligation
it
was
certainly
rather
handsome
in
carter
that
he
should
cheerfully
permit
his
wife
to
feel
admiration
and
gratitude
towards
so
handsome
a
young
man
as
colburne
that
infernal
poltroon
of
a
gazaway
he
broke
out
presently
i
ought
to
have
cashiered
him
long
ago
i
have
him
and
shot
by
the
way
he
was
perfectly
well
when
you
saw
him
was
he
i
should
think
so
he
looked
like
a
champion
of
the
heavy
weights
the
mere
reflection
of
his
biceps
was
enough
to
break
a
i
thought
he
had
run
away
from
the
service
altogether
he
came
up
to
the
regiment
once
during
the
siege
the
officers
kicked
him
out
and
he
disappeared
got
in
at
some
hospital
it
seems
by
this
and
that
three
quarters
of
the
hospitals
are
a
disgrace
to
the
service
they
are
asylums
for
shirks
and
cowards
i
wish
you
would
make
it
your
first
business
to
inform
yourself
of
all
gazaway
sneakings
misbehavior
in
presence
of
the
enemy
you
understand
violation
of
the
article
of
war
and
draw
up
charges
against
him
i
want
charges
that
will
shoot
him
here
i
may
as
well
anticipate
the
history
of
the
major
when
the
charges
against
him
were
forwarded
he
got
wind
of
them
and
making
a
personal
appeal
to
high
authority
pleaded
hard
for
leave
to
resign
on
a
surgeon
certificate
of
physical
disability
the
request
was
granted
for
some
mysterious
reason
probably
of
political
origin
and
this
vulgar
poltroon
left
the
army
and
the
department
with
no
official
stigma
on
his
character
on
reaching
barataria
he
appealed
to
his
faithful
old
herd
of
followers
and
assailed
colonel
carter
and
captain
colburne
as
a
couple
of
aristocrats
who
would
not
let
a
working
man
hold
a
commission
two
days
subsequent
to
colburne
arrival
at
port
hudson
the
brigade
sailed
to
fort
winthrop
and
from
thence
followed
the
trail
of
the
retreating
texans
as
far
as
thibodeaux
where
carter
established
his
a
week
later
when
the
rebels
were
all
across
the
atchafalaya
and
quiet
once
more
prevailed
in
the
lafourche
interieur
he
sent
to
new
orleans
for
his
wife
and
established
her
in
a
pretty
cottage
with
orange
trees
and
a
garden
in
the
outskirts
of
the
little
french
american
city
the
doctor
plantation
house
had
been
burned
his
agricultural
implements
destroyed
and
his
cattle
eaten
or
driven
away
by
the
rebels
who
put
a
devout
zeal
into
the
task
of
laying
waste
every
spot
which
had
been
desecrated
by
the
labor
of
manumitted
bondsmen
his
grand
experiment
of
reorganizing
southern
industry
being
thus
knocked
on
the
head
he
had
applied
for
and
obtained
his
old
position
in
the
hospital
lillie
wept
at
parting
from
him
but
nevertheless
flew
to
live
with
her
husband
the
months
which
she
passed
at
thibodeaux
were
the
happiest
that
she
had
ever
known
the
colonel
did
not
drink
was
with
her
every
moment
that
he
could
spare
from
his
duties
was
strongly
loving
and
noisily
cheerful
like
a
doting
dragoon
as
he
was
abounded
with
attentions
and
presents
bouquets
from
the
garden
and
dresses
from
new
orleans
was
uneasy
to
make
her
comfortable
and
exhibit
his
affection
the
whole
brigade
knew
her
and
delighted
to
look
at
her
drilling
badly
in
consequence
of
inattention
when
she
cantered
by
on
horseback
the
sentinels
when
not
watched
by
the
lieutenant
of
the
guard
gratified
themselves
and
amused
her
with
the
courteous
pleasantry
of
presenting
arms
as
she
passed
such
officers
as
were
aristocratic
enough
or
otherwise
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
bowing
acquaintance
still
more
to
be
invited
to
her
receptions
and
dinner
parties
flattered
her
by
their
evident
admiration
and
devotion
a
second
lieutenant
who
once
had
a
chance
to
shorten
her
stirrup
leather
alluded
to
it
for
weeks
afterward
and
received
the
nickname
from
his
envious
comrades
of
acting
assistant
flunkey
general

nineteenth
army
corps
it
made
no
difference
with
the
happy
youth
he
had
shortened
the
stirrup
of
the
being
who
was
every
body
admiration
and
from
his
pedestal
of
good
fortune
he
smiled
serenely
at
detraction
lillie
was
the
queen
the
goddess
the
only
queen
and
goddess
of
the
lafourche
interieur
in
the
whole
district
there
was
no
other
lady
except
the
wives
of
two
captains
who
occupied
a
much
lower
heaven
and
some
bitter
secessionists
who
kept
aloof
from
the
army
and
were
besides
wofully
scant
in
their
graces
and
wardrobe
the
adulation
which
she
received
did
not
come
from
the
highest
human
source
but
it
was
unmixed
unshared
constant
she
thought
it
was
the
most
delightful
thing
conceivable
to
keep
house
to
be
married
to
be
the
wife
of
colonel
carter
if
she
had
been
or
thirty
years
old
a
veteran
of
society
i
should
be
inclined
to
laugh
at
her
for
the
pleasure
she
took
in
her
conditions
and
surroundings
but
only
twenty
hardly
ever
at
a
party
married
without
a
wedding
married
less
than
six
months
i
sympathise
with
her
rejoice
with
her
in
her
unaccustomed
intoxication
of
happiness
it
was
curious
to
see
how
slowly
she
got
accustomed
to
her
husband
for
some
time
it
seemed
to
her
amazing
and
almost
incredible
that
any
man
should
call
himself
by
such
a
title
and
claim
the
familiarity
and
the
rights
which
it
implied
she
frequently
blushed
at
encountering
him
as
if
he
were
still
a
lover
if
she
met
the
bold
gaze
of
his
brown
eyes
she
trembled
with
an
inward
thrill
and
wanted
to
say
please
do
look
at
me
so
he
could
tyrannize
over
her
with
his
eyes
he
could
make
her
come
to
him
and
try
to
hide
from
them
by
nestling
her
head
on
his
shoulder
he
used
to
wonder
at
his
power
and
gratify
his
vanity
as
well
as
his
affection
by
using
it
an
officer
of
the
staff
who
believed
in
the
marvels
of
the
psychologists
observed
the
emotion
awakened
in
the
wife
by
the
husband
gaze
and
mentioned
it
to
colburne
as
a
proof
of
the
actuality
of
influence
the
captain
was
not
convinced
and
felt
a
strong
desire
to
box
the
officer
ears
what
right
had
the
fellow
to
make
the
movements
and
inclinations
of
that
woman
soul
an
object
of
curiosity
and
a
topic
of
conversation
he
offered
no
reply
to
the
remark
and
glared
in
a
way
which
astonished
the
other
who
had
the
want
of
delicacy
common
to
men
of
one
idea
colburne
divined
carter
too
well
to
adopt
the
magnetic
theory
judging
her
nature
out
of
the
depths
of
his
own
he
believed
that
love
was
the
true
and
explanation
of
her
nervousness
under
the
gaze
of
her
husband
it
was
a
painful
belief
firstly
for
the
very
natural
reason
that
he
was
not
himself
the
cause
of
the
emotion
secondly
because
he
feared
that
the
colonel
might
be
a
blight
to
the
delicate
affection
which
clasped
him
with
its
tendrils
his
relations
with
both
were
the
most
familiar
the
frankest
the
kindest
when
carter
could
not
ride
out
with
his
wife
he
detailed
colburne
for
the
agreeable
duty
when
carter
made
a
visit
to
headquarters
and
did
not
find
the
colonel
there
she
asked
for
the
the
friend
sent
the
lady
bouquets
by
the
hands
of
the
husband
carter
knew
to
some
extent
how
colburne
adored
lillie
but
he
had
a
fine
confidence
in
the
purity
and
humility
of
the
adoration
and
he
trusted
her
to
him
as
he
would
have
trusted
her
to
her
father
the
captain
was
not
a
member
of
the
family
the
cottage
was
too
far
from
his
official
duties
to
allow
of
that
but
he
dined
there
every
sunday
and
called
there
every
other
evening
ravenel
letters
to
one
or
the
other
were
the
common
property
of
both
if
lillie
did
not
hear
from
her
father
twice
a
week
and
therefore
became
anxious
about
him
because
it
was
the
yellow
fever
season
or
because
of
the
broad
fact
that
man
is
mortal
she
applied
to
colburne
as
well
as
to
her
husband
for
comforting
suggestions
and
assurances
in
company
with
some
chance
fourth
these
three
had
the
gayest
evenings
of
whist
and
euchre
lillie
never
looked
at
her
cards
without
exciting
the
laughter
of
the
two
men
by
declaring
that
she
had
a
thing
in
her
hand
positively
not
a
single
thing
could
take
a
trick
not
one
she
talked
perpetually
told
what
honors
she
held
stole
glances
at
her
opponent
hand
screamed
with
delight
when
she
won
and
in
short
violated
all
the
venerable
rules
of
whist
she
forgot
the
run
of
the
cards
trumped
her
partner
trick
led
diamonds
when
he
had
trashed
on
hearts
led
the
queen
when
she
held
ace
and
king
to
her
trumps
she
held
on
firmly
never
showing
them
till
the
last
moment
and
scolding
her
partner
if
he
called
them
out
she
invariably
claimed
the
deal
at
the
close
of
each
hand
thereby
getting
it
oftener
than
she
had
a
right
to
it
but
she
might
do
what
she
pleased
sure
that
those
who
played
with
her
would
not
complain
was
she
not
queen
and
goddess
semiramis
and
juno
who
would
rebel
even
in
the
slightest
particular
against
the
dominion
of
a
happiness
which
overflowed
in
such
gayety
such
confidence
in
all
around
such
unchangeable
amiability
she
was
in
superb
health
of
body
and
spirit
without
a
pain
or
a
sickly
moment
or
a
cloud
of
foreboding
or
a
thrill
of
pettishness
a
physical
calmness
so
deliciously
placid
as
to
remind
one
of
that
spiritual
peace
which
passeth
understanding
bore
her
gently
through
the
summer
smiling
on
all
beholders
do
you
remember
the
serene
angel
in
the
first
picture
of
cole
voyage
of
life
who
stands
at
the
helm
of
the
newly
launched
bark
guiding
it
down
the
gentle
river
it
is
the
mother
voyaging
with
her
child
whether
before
its
birth
or
after
just
now
she
looked
much
like
this
angel
only
more
frolicsomely
happy
her
blue
eyes
sparkled
with
the
lustre
of
health
so
perfect
that
the
mere
consciousness
of
a
life
was
a
pleasure
her
cheeks
usually
showing
more
of
the
lily
than
of
the
rose
were
so
radiant
with
color
that
it
seemed
as
if
every
throb
of
emotion
might
force
the
blood
through
the
delicate
skin
her
arms
neck
and
shoulders
were
no
longer
dianesque
but
rounded
columnal
junonian
it
was
this
novel
this
almost
superwomanly
health
which
gave
her
such
an
efflorescence
of
happiness
amiability
and
beauty
she
had
repeatedly
hinted
to
her
husband
that
she
had
a
secret
to
tell
him
when
he
asked
what
it
was
she
blushed
laughed
at
him
for
the
question
and
declared
that
he
should
never
know
it
that
she
had
no
secret
at
all
that
she
had
been
joking
then
she
wondered
that
he
should
not
guess
it
thought
it
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
that
he
should
not
know
it
at
last
she
made
her
confession
made
it
to
him
alone
with
closed
doors
and
in
darkness
she
could
no
more
have
told
it
in
the
light
of
day
than
in
the
presence
of
a
circle
then
for
many
minutes
she
nestled
close
to
him
with
wet
cheeks
and
clinging
arms
listening
eagerly
to
his
assurances
of
love
and
devotion
hungering
unappeaseably
for
them
growing
to
him
one
with
him
after
this
carter
treated
his
wife
with
increased
tenderness
nothing
that
she
desired
was
too
good
for
her
or
too
difficult
to
get
he
sought
to
check
the
constant
exercise
which
she
delighted
in
and
especially
her
long
rides
on
horseback
and
when
with
a
sweet
laughing
wilfulness
she
defied
his
authority
he
watched
her
with
evident
anxiety
he
wrote
about
it
all
to
her
father
and
the
consequence
was
a
visit
from
the
doctor
this
combination
of
natural
potentates
was
victorious
and
equestrianism
was
given
up
for
walking
and
tending
flowers
at
this
time
she
had
so
much
affection
to
spare
that
she
lavished
treasures
of
it
not
only
on
plants
but
on
birds
cats
dogs
and
ponies
here
colburne
drifted
into
the
circle
of
her
sympathies
he
was
fond
of
pets
especially
of
weak
ones
for
instance
liking
cats
better
than
dogs
and
liking
them
all
the
more
because
most
people
abused
and
as
he
contended
misunderstood
them
he
had
stories
to
tell
of
feline
creatures
who
had
loved
him
with
a
love
like
that
of
jonathan
for
david
passing
the
love
of
woman
there
was
the
abnormally
sensitive
tabby
who
pined
away
with
grief
when
his
mother
died
and
the
uncomformably
intelligent
tom
who
persisted
in
getting
into
his
trunk
when
he
was
packing
it
to
go
to
the
wars
i
am
confident
he
asserted
that
puss
knew
i
was
about
to
leave
and
wanted
to
be
taken
along
lillie
did
not
question
it
all
love
even
that
of
animals
seemed
natural
to
her
she
felt
not
thought
that
love
was
the
teacher
of
the
soul
by
the
way
colburne
passion
for
pets
had
deep
roots
in
his
character
it
sprang
from
his
pitying
fondness
for
the
weak
and
was
closely
related
to
his
sympathies
with
humanity
it
extended
to
the
feebler
members
of
his
own
race
such
as
children
and
old
ladies
whom
he
befriended
and
petted
whenever
he
could
and
who
in
return
granted
him
their
affection
for
flowers
and
in
general
for
inanimate
nature
he
cared
little
never
could
be
induced
to
study
botany
nor
to
understand
why
other
people
should
study
it
could
not
see
any
human
interest
in
it
geology
he
liked
because
it
promised
he
thought
some
knowledge
of
the
early
history
of
man
or
at
least
of
the
grand
cosmical
preparation
for
his
advent
astronomy
was
also
interesting
to
him
inasmuch
as
we
may
at
some
future
time
traverse
sidereal
spaces
the
most
interesting
star
in
the
heavens
to
his
mind
was
that
one
in
the
pleiades
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
central
sun
of
our
solar
and
planetary
system
around
this
all
that
he
knew
and
all
whom
he
loved
revolved
even
including
carter
i
presume
that
this
summer
was
the
happiest
period
in
the
life
of
the
colonel
he
was
in
fine
health
thanks
to
his
present
temperate
ways
although
they
reduced
his
weight
so
rapidly
that
his
wife
thought
he
was
sick
and
became
alarmed
about
him
he
frequently
recommended
marriage
to
colburne
and
they
had
long
conversations
on
the
subject
not
however
before
carter
whose
entrance
always
caused
the
captain
to
drop
the
subject
the
telemachus
was
as
fully
persuaded
of
the
benefits
happiness
and
duty
of
wedded
life
as
the
mentor
and
was
much
the
best
theorizer
i
believe
he
said
that
neither
man
nor
woman
is
a
complete
nature
by
himself
or
herself
and
that
you
must
unite
the
two
in
one
before
humanity
is
perfected
and
to
use
an
emersonianism
comes
full
circle
the
union
is
affection
and
the
consecration
of
it
is
marriage
you
remember
baron
munchausen
horse
how
he
was
cut
in
two
and
the
halves
got
on
very
poorly
without
each
other
and
how
they
were
reunited
with
mutual
benefit
now
this
is
the
history
of
every
bachelor
and
single
woman
who
having
miserably
tried
for
a
while
to
go
it
alone
finally
coalesce
happily
in
one
flesh
by
jove
captain
you
talk
like
a
philosopher
said
the
colonel
you
ought
to
write
something
you
ought
to
practice
too
according
to
your
preaching
there
is
larue
now
no
he
added
seriously
take
her
she
is
worthy
of
you
you
deserve
the
best
colburne
was
a
better
conversationalist
than
carter
except
in
the
way
of
small
talk
with
comparative
strangers
wherein
the
confidence
in
himself
strengthened
by
habits
of
authority
gave
him
an
easy
freedom
indeed
when
carter
was
actually
brilliant
in
society
you
might
be
sure
he
had
taken
five
or
six
plain
whiskeys
and
that
five
or
six
more
what
a
head
he
sported
would
make
him
moderately
drunk
if
my
readers
will
go
back
to
the
dinner
at
professor
whitewood
and
the
evening
which
followed
it
and
the
next
day
when
he
was
under
the
influence
of
a
whiskey
fever
they
will
see
the
best
that
he
could
do
as
a
talker
with
regard
to
subjects
which
implied
ever
so
little
scholarship
the
colonel
accorded
the
captain
a
facile
admiration
which
at
first
astonished
the
latter
talking
one
day
of
the
of
port
hudson
colburne
observed
that
the
romans
threw
up
field
fortifications
at
the
close
of
every
day
march
one
legion
standing
under
arms
to
protect
the
workmen
while
another
marched
out
and
formed
line
of
battle
to
cover
the
foragers
if
the
brigade
commander
had
ever
known
these
things
he
had
evidently
forgotten
them
he
looked
at
colburne
with
undisguised
astonishment
and
set
him
down
from
that
moment
as
a
fellow
of
infinite
erudition
this
was
far
from
being
the
only
occasion
on
which
the
volunteer
captain
was
led
to
notice
the
narrow
professional
basis
from
which
most
of
the
officers
of
the
old
service
talked
and
thought
now
and
then
he
met
a
philosopher
like
phelps
or
a
chemist
like
franklin
but
in
general
he
found
them
as
little
versed
in
the
ways
and
ideas
of
the
world
as
so
many
old
and
even
with
regard
to
their
own
profession
they
were
narrowly
practical
and
technical
amidst
all
these
pleasant
sentiments
and
conversings
carter
had
his
perplexities
and
anxieties
he
was
spending
more
than
his
income
and
neither
knew
how
to
increase
it
nor
how
to
curtail
his
outlay
besides
his
colonel
pay
he
had
no
resources
unless
indeed
dunning
letters
could
be
made
into
negotiable
paper
he
was
not
very
sensitive
on
the
subject
of
these
missives
and
in
fact
he
was
what
most
people
would
consider
disgracefully
callous
to
their
influence
but
he
looked
forward
with
alarm
to
a
time
when
his
credit
might
fail
altogether
and
his
wife
might
suffer
for
luxuries
chapter
xxvi
captain
colburne
describes
camp
and
field
life
a
perusal
of
the
letters
of
colburne
has
decided
me
to
sketch
some
of
the
smaller
incidents
of
his
experience
in
field
service
the
masculine
hardness
of
the
subject
will
perhaps
be
an
agreeable
relief
to
the
reader
after
the
scenes
of
domestic
felicity
not
very
comprehensible
or
interesting
to
bachelors
which
are
depicted
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
many
minor
hardships
of
a
soldier
are
i
presume
hardly
suspected
by
a
civilian
as
an
instance
of
what
an
officer
may
be
called
on
to
endure
even
under
favorable
circumstances
when
for
instance
he
is
not
in
libby
prison
nor
in
the
starvation
camp
at
andersonville
i
cite
the
following
passage
from
the
captain
correspondence
i
think
that
the
severest
trial
i
ever
had
was
on
a
transport
the
soldiers
were
on
half
rations
and
officers
you
know
must
feed
themselves
we
had
not
been
paid
for
four
months
and
i
commenced
the
voyage
which
was
to
last
three
days
with
cents
in
my
pocket
the
boat
charged
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
a
meal
such
were
the
prospects
and
i
considered
them
solemnly
i
said
to
myself
will
furnish
the
greatest
amount
of
nourishment
and
i
will
eat
only
dinner
the
first
day
i
went
without
breakfast
and
supper
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
i
awoke
fearfully
hungry
and
could
not
resist
the
folly
of
breakfast
i
had
character
enough
to
refuse
dinner
but
by
night
i
was
starving
again
possibly
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
be
ravening
after
food
i
ate
supper
that
was
my
last
possible
meal
on
board
the
steamer
i
had
no
chance
of
borrowing
for
every
one
was
about
as
poor
as
myself
and
to
add
to
my
sufferings
the
weather
was
superb
and
i
had
a
seafaring
appetite
i
was
truly
miserable
with
the
degrading
misery
of
hunger
thinking
like
a
dog
of
nothing
but
food
when
a
brother
officer
produced
a
watermelon
which
he
had
saved
for
this
supreme
moment
of
destitution
he
was
charitable
enough
to
divide
it
among
four
follow
paupers
and
on
that
quarter
of
a
watermelon
i
lived
hours
very
wretchedly
when
we
landed
i
was
in
command
of
the
regiment
but
could
hardly
give
an
order
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
shrunken
battalion
two
hours
afterwards
henry
brought
me
a
small
plate
of
stewed
onions
without
meat
or
bread
not
enough
to
feed
a
wethersfield
baby
i
ate
them
all
too
starved
to
ask
henry
whether
he
had
anything
for
himself
or
not
shameful
but
natural
ridiculous
as
it
may
seem
i
think
i
can
point
to
this
day
as
the
only
thoroughly
unhappy
one
in
two
years
of
service
it
was
not
severe
suffering
but
it
was
so
contemptible
so
animal
there
was
no
heroic
relief
to
it
i
felt
like
a
starved
cur
and
growled
at
the
government
and
thought
i
wanted
to
resign
hunger
like
sickness
has
a
depressing
effect
on
the
morale
and
changes
a
young
man
into
his
grandmother
it
appears
that
these
little
starvation
episodes
were
of
frequent
recurrence
in
one
letter
he
speaks
of
having
marched
all
day
on
a
single
biscuit
and
in
another
written
during
his
virginia
campaign
of
having
lived
for
eighteen
hours
on
green
apples
he
often
alluded
with
pride
to
the
hardihood
of
soul
which
privations
and
dangers
had
given
to
the
soldiers
our
men
are
not
heroes
in
battle
alone
he
writes
three
months
without
shelter
drenched
by
rain
or
scorched
by
the
sun
tormented
by
mosquitoes
tainted
with
fever
shaking
with
the
ague
they
appear
stoically
indifferent
to
all
hardships
but
their
lack
of
tobacco
out
of
the
four
hundred
men
whom
we
brought
to
this
poisonous
hole
brashear
city
forty
are
dead
and
one
hundred
and
sixty
are
in
hospital
we
can
hear
their
screams
a
mile
away
as
they
go
into
the
other
world
in
their
chariots
of
delirium
the
remainder
half
sick
themselves
thin
and
yellow
ghosts
in
ragged
uniforms
crawl
out
of
their
diminutive
shanties
and
go
calmly
to
their
duties
without
murmuring
without
a
desertion
what
a
scattering
there
would
be
in
a
new
england
village
in
which
one
tenth
of
the
inhabitants
should
die
in
six
weeks
of
some
local
disease
yet
these
men
are
new
englanders
only
tempered
to
steel
by
hardships
by
discipline
by
a
profound
sense
of
duty
how
i
have
seen
them
march
with
blistered
and
bleeding
feet
march
all
night
after
having
fought
all
day
march
when
every
step
was
a
crucifixion
oh
these
noblemen
of
nature
our
american
common
soldiers
in
the
face
of
suffering
and
of
death
they
are
my
equals
and
while
i
exact
their
obedience
i
accord
them
my
respect
the
mud
of
louisiana
appears
to
have
been
as
troublesome
a
footing
as
the
famous
sacred
soil
of
virginia
it
is
the
most
abominable
sticky
doughy
stuff
that
ever
was
used
in
any
country
for
earth
he
says
it
up
on
your
feet
like
damp
snow
on
a
horse
hoofs
i
have
repeatedly
seen
a
man
stop
and
look
behind
him
under
the
belief
that
he
had
lost
off
his
shoe
when
it
was
merely
the
dropping
of
the
immense
which
had
formed
around
his
foot
it
is
like
travelling
over
a
land
of
suet
saturated
with
pudding
sauce
just
now
the
rain
is
coming
down
as
in
the
days
of
noah
i
am
under
a
tent
for
an
unusual
mercy
but
the
drops
are
driven
through
the
rotten
canvass
by
the
wind
the
ditch
outside
my
dwelling
is
not
deep
enough
to
carry
off
all
the
water
which
runs
into
it
and
a
small
stream
is
stealing
under
my
bedding
and
forming
a
puddle
in
the
centre
of
my
floor
but
i
do
care
for
this
i
know
that
my
is
a
good
one
the
main
nuisance
is
that
my
interior
will
be
muddy
by
night
i
expect
to
be
in
a
new
tent
enlarged
and
elevated
by
a
siding
of
planks
so
that
i
shall
have
a
promenade
of
eight
feet
in
length
sheltered
from
the
weather
i
only
fear
that
the
odor
will
not
be
agreeable
for
the
planks
were
plundered
from
the
of
a
and
are
saturated
with
treacle
not
sticky
you
understand
but
quite
too
saccharinely
fragrant
it
appears
that
the
army
even
in
field
service
is
not
altogether
barren
of
convivialities
in
the
letter
following
the
one
quoted
above
he
says
my
new
dwelling
has
been
warmed
i
had
scarcely
taken
possession
of
it
when
a
brother
officer
half
seas
over
and
with
an
inscrutable
smile
on
his
lips
stalks
in
and
insists
upon
treating
the
occasion
i
can
not
prevent
it
without
offending
him
and
there
is
no
strong
reason
why
i
should
prevent
it
he
sends
to
the
sutler
for
two
bottles
of
claret
and
then
for
two
more
and
finishes
them
or
sees
that
they
are
finished
it
is
soon
evident
that
he
is
crowded
full
and
ca
carry
any
more
for
love
or
politeness
at
dress
parade
i
do
not
see
him
out
and
learn
that
he
is
in
his
tent
with
a
prospect
of
remaining
there
for
the
next
twelve
hours
yet
he
is
a
brave
faithful
officer
this
now
groggiest
of
sleepers
and
generally
a
very
temperate
one
so
that
everybody
is
wondering
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
giggling
over
his
unusual
obfuscation
in
another
letter
he
describes
a
jollification
by
division
on
the
anniversary
of
the
little
victory
of
georgia
landing
all
the
officers
not
only
of
the
old
brigade
but
of
the
entire
division
were
invited
to
headquarters
being
a
long
way
from
our
base
the
eatables
were
limited
to
dried
beef
pickles
and
and
the
only
refreshments
to
be
had
in
profusion
were
commissary
whiskey
and
martial
music
such
a
roaring
time
as
there
was
by
midnight
in
and
around
the
hollow
square
formed
by
the
headquarter
tents
by
dint
of
vociferations
the
general
was
driven
to
make
the
first
speech
of
a
he
confined
himself
chiefly
to
reminiscences
of
our
battles
and
made
a
very
pleasant
rambling
kind
of
talk
most
of
it
however
inaudible
to
me
who
stood
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
when
he
closed
tom
perkins
our
brave
and
bossy
roared
out
i
could
hear
much
of
what
you
said
but
i
believe
what
you
said
was
right
this
soldierly
profession
of
faith
was
followed
by
for
our
commander
everybody
joining
in
without
regard
to
grade
of
commission
then
captain
jones
of
our
regiment
shouted
barataria
three
cheers
for
our
old
comrades
at
georgia
landing
and
everywhere
else
the
new
york
and
the
cheers
were
given
then
captain
brown
of
the
seventy
fifth
replied
are
not
many
of
us
left
but
what
there
are
we
can
meet
the
occasion
three
cheers
for
the
tenth
barataria
then
one
excited
officer
roared
for
colonel
smith
and
another
howled
for
colonel
robinson
and
another
screamed
for
colonel
jackson
in
consequence
of
which
those
gentlemen
responded
with
speeches
nobody
seemed
to
care
for
what
they
said
but
all
hands
yelled
as
if
it
was
a
bayonet
charge
as
the
fun
got
fast
and
furious
public
attention
settled
on
a
gigantic
officer
stupendously
drunk
and
volcanically
uproarious
and
twenty
voices
united
in
shouting
zandt
van
zandt
the
great
van
zandt
smiling
like
an
intoxicated
hy√¶na
plunged
uncertainly
at
the
crowd
and
was
assisted
to
the
centre
of
it
there
as
if
he
were
about
to
make
an
oration
of
an
hour
or
so
he
dragged
off
his
overcoat
after
a
struggle
worthy
of
weller
senior
in
his
pursiest
days
then
held
up
by
two
friends
in
a
manner
which
reminded
me
obscurely
of
aaron
and
hur
sustaining
moses
he
stretched
out
both
hands
and
delivered
himself
as
follows
from
th
front
thar
from
the
front
thar
an
when
say
from
th
front
thar
he
probably
intended
to
disperse
some
musicians
and
contrabands
who
were
grinning
at
him
but
before
he
could
explain
himself
another
drunken
gentleman
reeled
against
him
vociferating
for
colonel
robinson
van
zandt
gave
way
with
a
gigantic
lurch
like
that
of
an
overbalanced
iceberg
which
carried
him
clean
out
of
the
circle
somebody
brought
him
his
overcoat
and
held
him
up
while
he
surged
into
it
then
he
fell
over
a
tent
rope
and
lay
across
it
for
five
minutes
struggling
to
regain
his
feet
and
smiling
in
a
manner
incomprehensible
to
the
beholder
he
made
no
effort
to
resume
his
speech
and
evidently
thought
that
he
had
finished
it
to
public
satisfaction
but
he
subsequently
addressed
the
general
in
his
tent
requesting
so
far
as
could
be
understood
that
the
tenth
might
be
mounted
as
cavalry
tom
perkins
also
staggered
into
the
presence
of
our
commander
and
made
him
a
pathetic
address
weeping
plentifully
over
his
own
maudlin
and
shaking
hands
repeatedly
with
the
remark
allow
me
to
take
you
by
the
hand
it
was
an
all
fools
evening
for
once
distinctions
of
rank
were
abolished
this
morning
we
are
subordinates
again
and
the
general
is
our
dignified
superior
officer
one
of
the
few
amusements
of
field
service
seems
to
consist
in
listening
to
the
faceti√¶
of
the
common
soldiers
more
particularly
the
irrepressible
hibernians
these
irishmen
he
says
are
certainly
a
droll
race
when
you
get
used
to
their
way
of
looking
at
things
my
paddies
have
jabbered
and
joked
more
since
they
entered
the
service
than
my
seventy
americans
backed
up
by
my
ten
germans
to
give
you
an
idea
of
how
they
prattle
i
will
try
to
set
down
a
conversation
which
i
overheard
while
we
were
bivouacking
on
the
field
of
our
first
battle
the
dead
are
buried
the
wounded
have
been
carried
to
a
temporary
hospital
the
pickets
are
out
watchful
we
may
be
sure
because
in
the
keen
october
wind
the
men
who
remain
with
the
colors
are
sitting
up
around
camp
fires
their
knapsacks
blankets
and
overcoats
three
miles
to
the
rear
this
seems
hard
measure
for
fellows
who
have
made
a
march
and
gained
a
victory
since
morning
but
my
irishmen
are
as
jolly
as
ever
blathering
and
chaffing
each
other
after
their
usual
fashion
the
butt
of
the
company
is
sweeney
a
withered
little
animal
who
walks
as
if
he
had
not
yet
thoroughly
learned
to
go
on
his
hind
legs
a
most
curious
mixture
of
simplicity
and
humor
an
actual
handy
andy
says
one
ought
to
do
the
biggest
part
of
the
fightin
you
ate
your
share
of
the
rashins
do
ate
no
more
rashins
than
i
get
retorts
sweeney
indignant
at
this
stale
calumny
like
to
see
the
man
as
did
you
did
blather
so
much
whin
thim
shells
was
about
your
head
here
sweeney
falls
back
upon
his
old
and
sometimes
successful
dodge
of
trying
to
turn
the
current
of
ridicule
upon
some
one
else
mickey
emmett
perlite
across
the
lot
he
demands
see
him
bowin
like
a
monkey
on
horseback
he
was
makin
faces
as
charrm
the
head
off
a
whalebarry
mickey
you
dodged
beautiful
thim
shells
make
a
wooden
man
dodge
sweeney
the
bye
for

he
was
a
runnin
about
like
a
dry
pea
in
a
hot
shovel
that
what
me
legs
was
made
for
are
ye
dead
sweeney
an
old
joke
which
i
do
not
understand
an
i
wud
be
if
i
was
yer
father
for
thinkin
of
the
drrunken
son
i
had
did
ye
see
that
dead
rebel
with
his
oye
out
the
leftenant
ate
up
all
his
corn
cake
while
he
noticin
it
was
lookin
at
sweeney
put
his
oye
out
it
lucky
for
him
he
did
see
the
pair
av
us
stop
your
yawping
you
paddies
and
let
a
fellow
sleep
if
he
can
you
worse
than
an
acre
of
tomcats
to
the
divil
wid
ye
it
a
pity
this
is
all
an
oirish
company
for
the
credit
of
the
captin
byes
it
mighty
cowld
slapin
with
niver
a
blanket
nor
a
wife
to
one
back
i
wish
a
man
ask
me
to
lisht
for
three
years
more
would
i
knock
his
head
off
ye
could
raich
the
head
av
a
man
sweeney
ye
got
the
hoight
for
it
i
throw
him
down
thin
i
be
tall
enough
and
so
they
go
on
till
one
or
two
in
the
morning
when
i
fall
asleep
leaving
them
still
talking
even
the
characteristics
of
a
brute
afford
matter
of
comment
amid
the
flatness
of
ordinary
camp
life
i
have
nothing
more
of
importance
to
communicate
he
says
in
one
letter
except
that
i
have
been
adopted
by
a
tailless
dog
who
probably
for
the
lack
of
other
following
persists
in
laying
claim
to
my
fealty
if
i
leave
my
tent
door
open
when
i
go
out
i
find
him
under
my
bunk
when
i
come
in
as
he
has
nothing
to
wag
he
is
put
to
it
to
express
his
approval
of
my
ways
and
character
when
i
speak
to
him
he
lies
down
on
his
back
with
a
meekness
of
expression
which
i
am
sure
has
not
been
rivalled
since
moses
he
is
the
most
abnormally
bobbed
dog
that
ever
excited
my
amazement
i
think
i
do
not
exaggerate
when
i
declare
that
his
tail
appears
to
have
been
amputated
in
the
small
of
his
back
how
he
can
draw
his
breath
is
a
wonder
in
fact
he
seems
to
have
lost
his
voice
by
the
operation
as
though
the
docking
had
injured
his
bronchial
tubes
for
he
never
barks
nor
growls
nor
whines
i
often
lose
myself
in
speculation
over
his
absent
appendage
questioning
whether
it
was
shot
away
in
battle
or
left
behind
in
a
rapid
march
or
bitten
off
or
pulled
out
perhaps
it
is
on
detached
service
as
a
or
has
got
a
promotion
and
become
a
brevet
lion
tail
perhaps
it
has
gone
to
the
dog
heaven
and
is
wagging
somewhere
in
glory
venturing
again
on
a
pun
i
observed
that
it
is
very
proper
that
an
army
dog
should
be
detailed
i
wish
i
could
find
his
master
i
have
just
one
observation
to
make
to
that
gentleman
i
would
say
to
him
is
your
i
do
want
the
beast
and
i
do
see
why
he
wants
me
but
i
ca
get
rid
of
him
any
more
than
i
can
of
henry
who
is
equally
useless
i
sometimes
try
to
estimate
the
infinitessimal
loss
which
the
world
would
experience
if
the
two
should
disappear
together
but
always
give
up
the
problem
in
despair
not
having
any
knowledge
of
fractions
small
enough
to
figure
it
in
a
general
way
says
colburne
we
are
sadly
off
for
amusements
fowling
is
not
allowed
because
the
noise
of
the
guns
alarms
the
pickets
even
alligators
i
have
only
shot
at
once
when
i
garrisoned
a
little
post
four
miles
from
camp
and
being
left
without
rations
was
obliged
to
subsist
my
company
for
a
day
on
boiled
saurian
the
meat
was
eatable
but
not
recommendable
to
persons
of
delicate
appetite
being
of
an
ancient
and
musky
flavor
as
though
it
had
been
put
up
in
its
horny
case
a
thousand
years
ago
by
the
way
a
minie
ball
knocks
a
hole
in
these
fellows
celebrated
jackets
without
the
slightest
difficulty
as
for
riding
after
hounds
or
on
steeple
chases
or
boxing
or
making
up
running
or
rowing
matches
after
the
gymnastic
fashion
of
english
officers
we
never
think
of
it
now
and
then
there
is
a
but
for
the
most
part
we
play
euchre
drill
is
no
longer
an
amusement
as
at
first
but
an
inexpressibly
wearisome
monotony
conversation
is
profitless
and
dull
except
when
it
is
professional
or
larkish
with
the
citizens
we
have
no
dealings
at
all
and
i
have
not
spoken
to
a
lady
since
i
left
new
orleans
books
are
few
because
we
can
not
carry
them
about
being
limited
in
our
baggage
to
a
and
moreover
i
have
lost
my
taste
for
reading
and
even
for
all
kinds
of
thinking
except
on
military
matters
my
brother
officers
you
know
are
brave
sensible
and
useful
men
but
would
not
answer
to
fill
the
professorial
chairs
of
winslow
university
they
represent
the
plain
people
whose
cause
is
being
fought
out
in
this
war
against
an
aristocracy
when
i
first
went
into
camp
with
the
regiment
they
humorously
recognized
my
very
slight
fashionable
elevation
by
styling
my
company
which
then
numbered
eighteen
men
upper
ten
thousand
now
all
such
distinctions
are
rubbed
out
it
is
who
can
fight
best
march
best
command
best
each
one
stands
on
the
base
of
his
individual
manhood
in
the
army
a
man
can
not
remain
long
on
a
social
pedestal
which
will
enable
him
to
overlook
the
top
of
his
own
head
he
can
obtain
no
respect
which
is
not
accorded
to
rank
or
merit
and
very
little
merit
is
acknowledged
except
what
is
of
a
professional
character
with
true
du
he
frequently
expatiates
on
the
excellencies
of
his
regiment
the
discipline
in
the
tenth
is
good
he
declares
and
consequently
there
are
no
mutinies
no
desertions
and
not
much
growling
ask
the
soldiers
if
they
are
satisfied
with
the
service
and
they
might
answer
but
you
can
not
always
judge
of
a
man
by
what
he
says
even
in
his
impulsive
moments
you
must
also
consider
what
he
does
look
at
an
old
man
he
growls
on
the
forecastle
but
is
as
meek
as
moses
on
the
and
notwithstanding
all
his
mutterings
he
is
always
at
his
post
and
does
his
duty
with
a
will
just
so
our
soldiers
frequently
say
that
they
only
want
to
get
out
of
the
service
but
never
run
away
and
rarely
manoeuvre
for
a
discharge
this
it
will
be
observed
was
before
the
days
of
substitutes
and
and
while
the
regiments
were
still
composed
of
the
noble
fellows
who
enlisted
during
the
first
and
second
years
of
the
war
from
all
that
i
can
learn
of
captain
colburne
i
judge
that
he
was
a
model
officer
at
least
so
far
as
a
volunteer
knew
how
to
be
one
while
his
men
feared
him
on
account
of
his
reserve
and
his
severe
discipline
they
loved
him
for
the
gallantry
and
cheerful
fortitude
with
which
he
shared
their
dangers
and
hardships
the
same
respect
which
he
exacted
of
them
he
accorded
at
least
outwardly
to
all
superior
officers
even
including
the
contemptible
gazaway
he
did
this
from
principle
for
the
good
of
the
service
believing
that
authority
ought
not
to
be
questioned
lightly
in
an
army
by
the
way
the
major
did
not
like
him
he
would
have
preferred
to
have
the
captain
jolly
and
familiar
and
vulgar
then
he
would
have
felt
at
ease
in
his
presence
this
gentlemanly
bearing
this
dignified
respect
kept
him
the
superior
at
a
distance
the
truth
is
that
although
gazaway
was
in
the
emphatic
language
of
lieutenant
van
zandt
an
inferior
cuss
he
nevertheless
had
intelligence
enough
to
suspect
the
profound
contempt
which
lay
behind
colburne
salute
only
in
the
captain
letters
to
his
intimate
friend
ravenel
does
he
speak
unbecomingly
of
the
major
he
is
says
one
of
these
epistles
a
conceited
unreasonable
domineering
ass
who
by
instinct
detests
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
education
he
will
issue
an
order
contrary
to
the
regulations
and
fly
into
a
rage
if
a
captain
represents
its
illegality
i
have
got
his
in
this
way
i
presume
as
well
perhaps
as
by
knowing
how
to
spell
correctly
his
orders
circulars
are
perfect
curiosities
of
literature
until
they
are
corrected
by
his
clerk
who
is
a
private
soldier
sometimes
i
am
almost
tired
of
obeying
and
respecting
my
inferiors
and
i
certainly
shall
not
continue
to
serve
a
day
after
the
war
is
over
however
these
matters
are
now
gazaway
being
out
of
the
regiment
i
mention
them
chiefly
to
show
the
manliness
of
character
which
this
intelligent
and
educated
young
officer
exhibited
in
remaining
in
the
service
notwithstanding
moral
annoyances
more
painful
to
bear
than
marches
and
battles
he
is
still
enthusiastic
has
not
by
any
means
had
fighting
enough
wants
to
go
to
virginia
in
order
to
be
in
the
thickest
of
it
he
is
disappointed
at
not
receiving
promotion
but
bears
it
bravely
and
uncomplainingly
for
the
sake
of
the
nation
bears
it
as
he
does

blistered

chapter
xxvii
colonel
carter
makes
an
astronomical
expedition
with
a
dangerous
fellow
traveller
a
prospect
of
flat
peace
and
boundless
prosperity
is
tiresome
to
the
human
eye
although
it
is
morally
agreeable
to
think
about
the
domestic
happiness
and
innocence
of
the
carters
as
sketched
in
a
late
chapter
there
is
danger
that
the
subject
might
easily
prove
tiresome
to
the
reader
and
moreover
it
is
difficult
to
write
upon
it
i
announce
therefore
with
intellectual
satisfaction
that
our
colonel
is
summoned
to
the
trial
of
bidding
to
his
wife
and
undertaking
a
journey
to
washington
it
was
his
own
work
and
for
his
own
interests
he
felt
the
necessity
of
adding
to
his
income
and
desired
the
honor
and
claimed
the
justice
of
promotion
high
authority
in
the
department
admitted
that
the
star
of
a
brigadier
was
not
too
high
a
reward
for
this
brave
man
thoroughly
instructed
officer
model
colonel
high
authority
was
tired
of
gerrymandering
seniorities
so
as
to
give
a
superb
brigade
of
three
thousand
men
to
the
west
point
veteran
carter
and
a
skeleton
division
of
nine
hundred
men
to
the
of
militia
of
pompoosuc
john
snooks
accordingly
when
the
colonel
applied
for
a
month
leave
of
absence
with
the
understood
purpose
of
sueing
for
an
acknowledgment
of
his
services
high
authority
made
him
bearer
of
dispatches
to
washington
so
that
being
on
duty
he
might
pay
his
travelling
expenses
out
of
the
government
pocket
the
same
mail
which
brought
him
his
order
informed
him
that
a
steamer
would
sail
for
the
north
on
the
next
day
but
one
acting
with
the
rapidity
which
always
marked
his
movements
when
he
had
once
decided
on
his
course
he
took
the
next
morning
train
for
new
orleans
first
pressing
his
wife
for
many
times
to
his
breast
and
kissing
away
such
of
her
tears
as
he
could
stay
to
witness
to
good
angels
and
other
people
capable
of
appreciating
such
things
it
would
have
been
a
pretty
though
pathetic
spectacle
to
see
this
slender
girl
clinging
to
the
strong
bronzed
richly
colored
man
with
the
burning
black
eyes
oh
what
shall
i
do
without
you
she
moaned
what
shall
i
do
with
myself
my
dear
little
child
he
said
you
will
do
just
what
you
like
if
you
choose
to
stay
here
and
keep
house
captain
colburne
will
see
that
you
are
cared
for
perhaps
it
may
be
best
however
to
join
your
father
here
are
two
hundred
dollars
all
the
money
that
i
have
except
what
is
necessary
to
take
me
to
new
orleans
i
shall
get
a
month
pay
there
do
settle
any
bills
tell
people
that
i
will
attend
to
them
when
i
come
there
do
keep
me
my
dear
one
do
make
me
lose
the
train
so
he
went
driving
to
the
railroad
in
an
ambulance
while
lillie
looked
after
him
with
tearful
eyes
and
waved
her
handkerchief
and
kissed
her
hand
till
he
was
out
of
sight
at
first
she
decided
that
she
would
remain
at
thibodeaux
and
think
of
her
husband
in
every
room
of
the
house
and
every
walk
of
the
garden
but
after
two
days
she
found
herself
so
miserably
lonesome
that
she
shut
up
the
cottage
went
to
new
orleans
and
threw
herself
upon
her
father
for
consolation
having
told
so
much
in
anticipation
we
will
go
back
to
the
colonel
the
two
hundred
dollars
which
he
left
with
his
wife
had
been
borrowed
from
the
willing
colburne
carter
had
no
pay
due
him
as
he
had
hinted
but
he
hoped
to
obtain
a
month
advance
from
a
paymaster
or
failing
in
that
to
borrow
from
some
one
say
the
commanding
general
in
fact
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
abstracted
from
government
funds
i
fear
were
furnished
him
by
a
neglected
quartermaster
who
likewise
wanted
promotion
and
was
willing
to
run
this
risk
for
the
sake
of
securing
the
benign
influences
of
carter
future
star
with
this
friend
in
need
the
colonel
took
the
first
glass
of
plain
whiskey
which
he
had
swallowed
in
three
months
to
this
followed
other
glasses
proffered
by
other
friends
whose
importunity
he
could
not
now
resist
although
yesterday
he
had
repulsed
them
with
ease
every
brother
colonel
every
appreciating
brigadier
seemed
possessed
of
satan
to
lead
him
to
a
bar
or
to
his
own
quarters
and
there
to
toast
his
health
or
his
luck
or
his
star
it
was
here
how
and
here
towards
you
from
ten
in
the
morning
when
he
got
his
money
until
four
in
the
afternoon
when
he
sprang
on
board
the
creole
just
as
she
loosed
her
moorings
from
the
shaky
posts
of
the
tattered
wooden
wharf
being
in
that
state
of
exhilaration
which
enabled
tam
to
gaze
on
the
witches
of
alloway
without
flinching
the
colonel
was
neither
astonished
nor
alarmed
at
encountering
on
the
the
calm
beautiful
dangerous
eyes
of
madame
larue
the
day
before
he
would
have
been
almost
willing
to
lose
the
steamer
rather
than
travel
with
her
now
in
the
fearlessness
of
plain
whiskey
he
shook
both
her
hands
with
impetuous
warmth
and
said
honor
larue
perfectly
delighted
to
see
you
and
so
am
i
delighted
she
answered
with
a
flash
of
unfeigned
pleasure
in
her
eyes
which
might
have
alarmed
the
carter
of
yesterday
but
which
gratified
the
carter
of
now
i
shall
have
a
cavalier
she
continued
allowing
him
to
pull
her
down
on
a
seat
by
his
side
now
i
shall
have
a
protector
and
adviser
i
have
had
such
need
of
one
did
you
know
that
i
was
going
on
this
boat
i
am
so
flattered
if
you
meant
to
accompany
me
i
am
going
north
to
invest
my
little
property
i
still
fear
that
it
is
not
safe
here
no
one
knows
what
may
happen
here
as
soon
as
i
could
sell
for
a
convenable
sum
i
resolved
to
go
north
i
shall
expect
you
to
be
my
counsellor
how
to
invest
carter
laughed
boisterously
my
dear
i
never
invested
a
picayune
in
my
life
he
said
she
noticed
the
term
of
endearment
and
the
fact
of
but
she
was
not
vexed
nor
alarmed
by
either
she
was
tolerably
well
accustomed
to
drunken
gentlemen
and
she
was
not
easily
hurt
by
no
matter
how
vigorous
you
have
always
invested
in
the
bank
of
love
she
remarked
with
one
of
those
amatory
glances
which
black
eyes
it
seems
to
me
can
make
more
effective
than
blue
ones
and
in
monte
and
faro
and
bluff
and
euchre
he
added
laughing
loudly
again
in
wine
bills
and
hotel
bills
and
tailors
bills
and
all
sorts
of
negatives
the
debts
which
weighed
somewhat
heavily
yesterday
were
mere
comicalities
and
piquancies
of
life
oh
you
are
a
terrible
personage
i
fear
you
are
not
the
protector
i
ought
to
choose
he
made
no
reply
feeling
vaguely
that
the
conversation
was
growing
dangerous
and
sending
back
a
thought
to
his
wife
like
a
cry
for
help
larue
divined
his
alarm
and
changed
the
subject
what
makes
you
voyage
north
she
asked
with
a
knowing
smile
are
you
in
search
of
a
new
planet
through
his
plain
whiskey
the
colonel
could
not
see
her
joke
on
the
star
which
he
was
seeking
but
he
was
still
clever
enough
to
shun
the
confession
that
he
was
on
an
expedition
in
search
of
promotion
i
am
bearer
of
dispatches
he
said
nothing
to
do
now
in
louisiana
i
shall
be
back
before
any
more
fighting
comes
off
shall
you
i
am
enchanted
of
it
i
shall
return
soon
and
hope
to
make
the
voyage
with
you
i
am
not
going
to
forsake
new
orleans
i
love
the
city
well
enough
and
more
i
can
not
sell
my
house
remember
you
must
let
me
know
when
you
return
and
arrange
yourself
to
come
on
my
steamer
next
morning
in
possession
of
his
sober
senses
carter
endeavored
to
detach
himself
a
little
from
larue
impelled
to
this
seeming
lack
of
chivalry
by
remembrance
of
his
wife
and
mistrust
of
his
own
power
of
but
this
prudent
course
soon
appeared
to
be
impossible
for
a
variety
of
reasons
in
the
first
place
it
happened
whether
by
chance
or
through
her
forethought
he
did
not
know
that
their
opened
on
the
same
narrow
passage
in
the
second
place
he
was
the
only
acquaintance
that
larue
had
on
board
and
there
was
not
another
lady
to
take
her
up
the
creole
being
a
government
transport
and
civilian
travel
being
in
those
times
rare
between
new
york
and
new
orleans
moreover
the
other
passengers
were
in
his
estimation
low
or
at
least
plain
people
such
as
sutlers
speculators
and
rough
volunteer
officers
so
that
if
he
left
her
she
was
alone
and
could
not
even
venture
on
deck
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
at
any
rate
that
was
the
way
that
she
chose
to
put
it
although
there
was
not
the
least
danger
that
she
would
be
insulted
and
although
had
carter
been
absent
she
would
not
have
failed
to
strike
up
a
flirtation
with
some
other
representative
of
my
noble
sex
finally
he
was
obliged
to
consider
that
she
was
a
relative
of
his
wife
thus
before
the
second
day
was
over
he
found
himself
under
bonds
of
courtesy
to
be
the
constant
attendant
of
larue
they
sat
together
next
the
head
of
the
table
the
lady
being
protected
from
the
ignoble
crowd
of
volunteers
by
the
colonel
on
one
side
and
the
captain
of
the
creole
on
the
other
opposite
them
were
a
major
and
a
chaplain
highly
respectable
persons
so
far
as
one
could
judge
from
their
conversation
but
who
never
got
a
word
rarely
a
look
from
larue
or
carter
the
captain
talked
first
with
one
party
then
with
the
other
but
never
with
both
at
once
he
was
a
polite
and
considerate
man
accustomed
to
his
delicate
official
position
as
a
host
and
he
saw
that
he
would
not
be
thanked
for
making
the
conversation
general
except
to
him
to
carter
and
to
the
servants
larue
did
not
speak
one
word
during
the
first
seven
days
of
the
passage
all
the
volunteer
officers
admired
her
demeanor
kept
afar
off
and
with
no
other
woman
in
sight
they
began
to
worship
her
much
as
the
brigade
at
thibodeaux
adored
that
solitary
planet
of
loveliness
carter
the
fact
that
she
was
a
widow
which
crept
out
in
some
inexplicable
manner
only
heightened
the
enthusiasm
by
heavens
declared
one
flustered
captain
if
i
only
had
colonel
before
my
name
and
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
after
it
i
would
rush
to
her
and
say
are
you
inconsolable
i
persuade
you
to
forget
the
dear
departed
while
these
gentlemen
worshipped
her
carter
hoped
she
would
get
this
great
brawny
boisterous
domineering
heroic
fighter
had
just
enough
moral
vitality
to
know
when
he
was
in
danger
of
falling
and
to
wish
for
safety
those
were
perilous
hours
at
evening
when
the
ship
swept
steadily
through
a
lulling
whisper
of
waters
when
a
trail
of
foamy
phosphorescense
like
a
transitory
milky
way
followed
in
pursuit
when
a
broad
bar
of
rippling
light
ran
straight
out
to
the
setting
moon
when
the
decks
were
deserted
except
by
slumberers
and
larue
persisted
in
dallying
the
temptation
of
darkness
the
temptation
of
solitude
the
fever
which
begins
to
turn
sleepless
brains
at
midnight
made
this
her
possible
hour
of
coquettish
conquest
she
varied
from
delicately
phrased
sentimentalities
to
hoydenish
physical
impertinences
he
was
not
permitted
for
five
minutes
together
to
forget
that
she
was
a
bodily
as
well
as
a
spiritual
presence
he
was
not
checked
in
any
transitory
license
of
speech
or
gesture
meantime
she
quoted
fine
rhapsodies
from
balzac
and
repeated
telling
situations
from
dumas
le
jeune
and
commented
on
both
in
the
interest
of
the
passion
de
once
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
and
revery
she
said
with
an
air
of
earnest
feeling
is
it
not
a
horrible
fate
for
a
woman
solitude
do
you
not
pity
me
thirty
years
old
a
widow
and
childless
no
one
to
love
no
right
to
love
any
one
she
changed
into
french
now
as
she
frequently
did
when
she
was
animated
and
wished
to
express
herself
freely
such
talk
as
this
sounds
unnatural
in
the
language
of
the
but
is
not
so
unbecoming
to
the
tongue
of
the
gauls
a
woman
to
whom
the
affections
are
forbidden
is
deprived
of
the
use
of
more
than
half
her
being
whatever
her
possibilities
she
is
denied
all
expansion
beyond
a
certain
limit
she
may
not
explore
much
less
use
her
own
heart
it
contains
chambers
of
joy
which
she
can
only
guess
of
and
into
which
she
must
not
enter
there
is
a
nursery
of
affections
there
but
she
can
only
stand
with
her
ear
to
the
door
trying
to
hear
the
sweet
prattle
within
there
is
an
innermost
chapel
with
an
altar
all
set
for
the
communion
of
love
but
no
priest
to
invite
her
to
the
holy
banquet
she
is
capable
of
a
mother
everlasting
devotion
but
she
scarcely
dares
suspect
it
she
is
fitted
to
enter
upon
the
tender
mysteries
of
wifehood
and
yet
she
is
constantly
fearing
that
she
shall
never
meet
a
man
whom
she
can
love
that
is
the
old
maid
horrible
name
the
widow
is
less
ashamed
but
she
is
more
unhappy
she
has
been
taught
her
possibilities
and
then
suddenly
forbidden
the
use
of
them
had
the
colonel
been
acquainted
with
michelet
and
his
fellow
rhapsodists
on
women
he
might
have
suspected
madame
of
a
certain
amount
of
plagiarism
but
he
only
thought
her
amazingly
clever
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
unable
to
answer
her
in
her
own
style
why
do
you
marry
he
asked
striking
with
practicality
at
the
root
of
the
matter
satirical
question
responded
madame
putting
her
face
close
to
his
doubtless
in
order
to
make
her
smile
visible
by
moonlight
it
is
not
so
easy
to
marry
in
these
frightful
times
besides
shall
i
avow
it
what
if
i
can
not
marry
the
man
of
my
choice
that
bad
what
if
he
marry
some
one
else
is
it
not
a
humiliating
confession
do
you
know
what
is
left
to
a
woman
then
either
hidden
love
or
spiritual
which
is
the
greater
of
the
two
crimes
the
former
a
crime
society
says
so
but
are
there
not
exceptions
to
all
rules
even
moral
ones
love
always
has
this
great
defence
that
nature
prompts
it
commands
it
as
for
asphyxia
of
the
heart
nature
never
prompts
that
the
logical
conclusion
of
all
this
sentimental
sophistry
was
clear
enough
to
carter
intellect
although
it
did
not
deceive
his
conscience
he
understood
briefly
and
in
a
matter
of
fact
way
that
madame
was
quite
willing
to
be
his
wife
rival
he
was
not
yet
prepared
to
accept
the
offer
he
only
feared
and
anticipated
that
he
should
be
brought
to
accept
it
larue
was
a
curious
study
her
vices
and
virtues
for
she
had
both
were
all
instinctive
without
a
taint
of
education
or
effort
she
did
just
what
she
liked
to
do
unchecked
by
conscience
or
by
anything
but
prudence
she
was
as
corrupt
as
possible
without
and
as
amiable
as
possible
without
her
serenity
was
at
all
times
as
unrippled
as
was
that
of
lillie
in
her
happiest
conditions
her
temper
was
so
sunny
her
smile
so
ready
and
her
manner
so
flattering
that
few
persons
of
the
male
sex
could
resist
liking
her
but
she
was
the
detestation
of
most
of
her
lady
acquaintance
who
were
venomously
jealous
of
her
attractions
or
rather
seductions
and
abhorred
her
for
the
unscrupulous
manner
in
which
she
put
them
to
use
abusing
her
in
a
way
which
was
enough
to
make
a
man
rally
to
her
rescue
she
really
cared
little
for
that
sens
du
concerning
which
she
prattled
so
freely
to
her
intimates
and
therefore
she
was
cool
and
sure
in
her
coquetries
at
the
same
time
that
vanity
gave
her
motive
force
which
some
naughty
flirts
derive
from
passion
she
took
a
pride
in
making
conquests
of
men
at
no
matter
what
personal
sacrifice
carter
saw
where
he
was
drifting
to
and
groaned
over
it
in
spirit
and
made
resolutions
which
he
broke
in
half
an
hour
and
rowed
desperately
against
the
tide
and
then
drifted
again
a
woman
in
the
same
house
has
so
many
devilish
chances
at
a
fellow
he
repeated
to
himself
with
a
bitter
laugh
and
indeed
he
coarsely
said
as
much
to
larue
with
a
desperate
hope
of
angering
and
alienating
her
she
put
on
a
meekly
aggrieved
air
drew
away
from
him
and
answered
that
is
unmanly
in
you
i
did
not
think
you
could
be
so
dishonorable
he
was
deeply
humiliated
begged
her
pardon
swore
that
he
was
merely
jesting
and
troubled
himself
much
to
obtain
forgiveness
during
the
whole
of
that
day
she
was
distant
dignified
and
silently
reproachful
yet
all
the
while
she
was
not
a
bit
angry
with
him
she
was
as
malicious
as
mephistopheles
but
she
was
also
as
moreover
she
was
flattered
and
elated
by
the
evident
desperation
which
drove
him
to
the
impertinence
in
his
efforts
to
obtain
a
reconciliation
carter
succeeded
so
thoroughly
that
the
scene
took
place
late
at
night
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
his
lips
touching
her
cheek
you
must
remember
charitably
or
indignantly
as
you
please
that
she
was
his
wife
relative
from
this
time
forward
he
pretty
much
stopped
his
futile
rowing
against
the
tide
he
let
larue
take
the
helm
and
guide
him
down
the
current
of
his
own
emotions
singing
meanwhile
her
syren
lyrics
about
sainte
etc
etc
there
were
hours
indeed
when
he
grated
over
reefs
of
remorse
at
the
thought
of
his
innocent
loving
trusting
wife
he
shut
his
eyes
as
if
to
keep
out
the
gaze
of
a
reproachful
spectre
clenched
his
hands
as
if
trying
to
grasp
some
rope
of
escape
and
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
and
a
villain
but
it
was
a
penitence
without
fruit
a
without
larue
treated
him
now
with
a
familiar
and
confiding
fondness
which
he
sometimes
liked
and
sometimes
not
according
as
the
present
or
the
past
had
the
strongest
hold
on
his
feelings
i
am
afraid
that
you
do
not
always
realize
that
we
are
one
for
life
she
said
in
one
of
her
earnest
french
speaking
moods
you
are
my
sworn
friend
forever
you
must
never
hate
me
you
can
not
you
must
never
change
towards
me
it
would
be
a
perjury
of
the
heart
but
i
do
not
doubt
you
my
dear
friend
i
have
all
confidence
in
you
oh
i
am
so
happy
in
feeling
that
we
are
united
in
such
an
indissoluble
concord
of
sympathy
carter
could
only
reply
by
taking
her
hand
and
pressing
it
in
silence
he
was
absolutely
ashamed
of
himself
that
he
was
able
to
feel
so
little
and
to
say
nothing
i
never
shall
desire
a
husband
she
proceeded
i
can
now
use
all
my
heart
what
does
a
woman
need
more
how
strangely
heaven
has
made
us
a
woman
is
only
happy
when
she
is
the
slave
body
and
soul
of
some
man
she
is
happy
just
in
proportion
to
her
obedience
and
then
only
she
is
aware
of
her
full
nature
she
is
relieved
from
prison
and
permitted
the
joy
of
expansion
it
is
a
seeming
paradox
but
it
is
solemnly
true
carter
made
no
answer
not
even
by
a
look
he
was
thinking
that
his
wife
never
philosophised
concerning
her
love
never
analyzed
her
sentiments
and
a
shock
of
as
startling
as
the
throb
of
a
struck
him
as
he
called
to
mind
her
purity
trust
and
affection
it
is
curious
by
the
way
that
he
suffered
no
remorse
on
account
of
larue
in
his
opinion
she
fared
no
worse
than
she
deserved
and
in
fact
fared
precisely
as
she
desired
only
he
had
not
the
nerve
to
tell
her
so
when
late
one
night
on
the
darkened
and
deserted
she
cried
on
his
shoulder
and
whispered
i
am
afraid
you
do
love
me
i
have
a
right
to
claim
your
love
he
felt
no
affection
no
gratitude
not
even
any
profound
pity
it
annoyed
him
that
she
should
weep
and
thus
as
it
were
reproach
him
and
thus
trouble
still
further
his
wretched
happiness
he
was
not
hypocrite
enough
to
say
i
love
you
he
could
only
kiss
her
repeatedly
penitently
and
in
silence
he
still
had
a
remnant
of
a
conscience
and
a
mangled
sore
sense
of
honor
nor
should
it
be
understood
that
larue
tears
were
entirely
hypocritical
although
they
arose
from
emotions
which
were
so
trivial
as
to
be
somewhat
difficult
to
handle
and
so
mixed
that
i
scarcely
know
how
to
assort
them
in
the
first
place
she
was
not
very
well
that
evening
and
was
oppressed
by
the
despondency
which
all
human
beings
especially
women
suffer
from
when
vitality
throbs
less
vigorously
than
usual
moreover
a
little
emotion
of
this
sort
was
desirable
firstly
to
complete
the
conquest
of
carter
by
reminding
him
how
much
she
had
sacrificed
for
him
and
secondly
to
rehabilitate
herself
in
her
own
esteem
by
proving
that
she
possessed
a
species
of
conscience
no
woman
likes
to
believe
herself
hopelessly
corrupt
when
she
reaches
that
point
she
is
subject
to
moral
spasms
which
make
existence
seem
a
horror
and
we
perhaps
find
her
floating
in
the
river
or
asphyxiated
with
charcoal
therefore
let
no
one
be
surprised
at
the
temporary
tenderness
similar
to
compunction
which
overcame
larue
now
that
these
two
had
that
conscience
which
makes
cowards
of
us
all
they
dropped
a
portion
of
the
reserve
with
which
they
had
hitherto
kept
their
at
a
distance
the
captain
was
encouraged
to
introduce
his
two
neighbors
the
major
and
chaplain
and
larue
cast
a
few
telling
glances
at
the
former
and
discussed
theological
subjects
with
the
latter
to
one
who
knew
her
and
was
not
shocked
by
her
masquerades
nothing
could
be
more
diverting
than
the
airs
which
she
put
on
achalander
le
carter
and
she
laughed
heartily
over
them
in
their
evening
asides
she
would
have
made
a
capital
actress
in
the
natural
comedy
school
known
on
the
boards
of
the
gymnase
and
at
wallack
for
it
was
an
easy
amusement
to
her
to
play
a
variety
of
social
characters
she
had
no
strong
emotions
nor
profound
principles
of
action
it
is
true
but
she
was
sympathetic
enough
to
divine
them
and
clever
enough
to
imitate
their
expression
her
manner
to
the
chaplain
was
so
religiously
respectful
as
to
pull
all
the
strings
of
his
unconscious
vanity
personal
and
professional
so
that
he
fell
an
easy
prey
to
her
humbugging
declared
that
he
considered
her
state
of
mind
deeply
interesting
prayed
for
her
in
secret
and
hoped
to
convert
her
from
the
errors
of
papacy
indeed
her
profession
of
faith
was
promising
if
not
finally
satisfactory
i
believe
in
the
holy
catholic
church
she
said
but
i
am
not
i
think
that
others
also
may
have
the
truth
our
faith
yours
and
mine
is
at
bottom
one
indivisible
uncontradictory
it
is
only
our
human
weakness
which
leads
us
to
dispute
with
each
other
we
dispute
not
as
to
the
faith
but
as
to
who
holds
it
this
is
uncharitable
it
is
like
quarrelsome
children
the
chaplain
was
charmed
to
agree
with
her
he
thought
her
the
most
hopefully
religious
catholic
that
he
had
ever
met
he
also
thought
her
the
wittiest
the
most
graceful
and
on
the
whole
the
handsomest
her
eyes
alone
were
enough
to
deceive
him
they
were
inexhaustible
greenrooms
of
sparkling
masks
and
disguises
and
he
was
especially
taken
with
the
madonnesque
gaze
which
issued
from
their
recesses
he
was
bamboozled
also
by
the
prim
broad
white
collar
like
a
surplice
which
she
put
on
expressly
to
attract
him
by
the
demure
air
of
childlike
piety
which
clothed
her
like
a
mantle
by
her
deference
to
his
opinion
by
her
teachable
spirit
perhaps
he
may
also
have
been
pleased
with
her
plump
shoulders
and
round
arms
and
he
certainly
did
glance
at
them
occasionally
as
their
outlines
showed
through
the
transparent
muslin
but
he
said
nothing
of
them
in
his
talks
concerning
larue
with
his
the
major
apprivois√©
le
she
observed
laughingly
to
carter
i
have
assured
myself
a
firm
friend
in
his
reverence
he
will
defend
me
the
character
always
he
has
asked
me
to
visit
his
family
and
promised
to
call
to
see
me
at
new
york
madame
la
pr√™tresse
is
to
call
also
he
is
quite
capable
of
praying
me
to
stand
godmother
to
his
next
child
if
he
were
not
married
i
should
have
an
offer
i
believe
i
could
bring
him
to
elope
with
me
in
a
fortnight
why
do
you
asked
carter
it
would
make
a
scandal
that
would
amuse
you
he
added
somewhat
bitterly
for
he
was
at
times
disgusted
by
her
heartlessness
no
my
dear
she
replied
gently
pressing
his
arm
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
my
one
conquest
it
is
all
i
desire
in
the
world
they
were
leaning
against
the
taffrail
listening
to
the
gurgling
of
the
waters
in
the
luminous
wake
and
watching
the
black
lines
of
the
masts
waving
against
the
starlit
sky
you
are
silent
she
observed
why
are
you
so
sad
i
am
thinking
of
my
wife
he
replied
almost
sullenly
poor
lillie
i
wish
she
were
here
said
larue
my
god
what
a
woman
you
are
exclaimed
the
colonel
do
you
know
that
i
should
be
ashamed
to
look
her
in
the
face
my
dear
why
do
you
distress
yourself
so
you
can
love
her
still
i
am
not
exacting
i
only
want
a
corner
in
your
heart
if
i
might
i
would
demand
the
whole
but
i
know
i
could
not
have
it
you
ought
not
to
be
unhappy
that
is
my
part
in
the
drama
i
have
sacrificed
much
what
have
you
sacrificed
a
man
risks
nothing
loses
nothing
in
these
affairs
he
has
a
bonne
fortune
carter
was
heavy
laden
in
secret
with
his
bonne
fortune
he
was
glad
when
the
voyage
ended
and
he
could
leave
larue
at
new
york
with
a
pleasing
chance
that
he
might
never
meet
her
again
and
a
hope
that
he
had
heard
the
last
of
her
passion
de
of
course
he
was
obliged
before
he
quitted
her
to
see
that
she
was
established
in
a
good
boarding
house
and
to
introduce
her
to
one
or
two
respectable
families
among
his
old
acquaintance
in
the
city
of
course
also
he
said
nothing
to
these
families
about
her
propensities
towards
the
and
the
she
quickly
made
herself
a
character
as
a
southern
loyalist
and
as
such
became
quite
a
pet
in
society
before
she
had
been
a
week
in
the
city
she
was
an
inmate
of
the
household
of
the
rev
whitehead
a
noted
theologian
and
leading
abolitionist
who
worked
untiringly
at
the
seemingly
easy
task
of
converting
her
from
the
errors
of
slavery
and
papacy
it
somewhat
scandalized
his
graver
parishioners
especially
those
of
copperhead
tendencies
that
he
should
patronize
so
gay
a
lady
but
the
reverend
doctor
did
not
see
her
pranks
and
did
not
believe
the
tale
when
others
related
them
how
could
he
when
she
looked
the
picture
of
a
saint
dressed
entirely
in
black
and
white
wore
her
hair
plain
la
and
talked
theology
with
those
earnest
eyes
and
that
childlike
smile
to
the
last
he
honestly
regarded
her
as
very
nigh
unto
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
was
to
shield
her
from
envious
slanders
to
cover
her
with
the
√¶gis
of
his
great
and
venerable
name
that
the
unsuspicious
old
gentleman
dedicated
to
her
his
little
work
on
moral
reform
entitled
mary
magdalen
how
ecstatically
larue
laughed
over
this
book
when
she
got
to
her
own
room
with
it
after
the
presentation
she
had
not
had
such
a
paroxysm
of
merriment
before
since
she
was
a
child
for
during
all
her
adult
life
she
had
been
too
to
laugh
often
with
profound
heartiness
and
honesty
her
gayety
had
been
superficial
like
most
of
her
other
expressions
of
feeling
i
can
imagine
that
she
looked
very
attractive
in
her
spasm
of
jollity
with
her
black
eyes
sparkling
her
brunette
cheeks
flushed
her
jetty
streams
of
hair
waving
and
her
darkly
roseate
arms
and
shoulders
bare
in
the
process
of
undressing
before
she
went
to
bed
she
put
the
book
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
carter
and
wrote
a
playful
letter
to
accompany
it
signed

best
and

loving

chapter
xxviii
the
colonel
continues
to
be
led
into
temptation
on
the
cars
between
new
york
and
washington
carter
encountered
the
governor
of
barataria
after
the
customary
compliments
had
been
exchanged
after
the
governor
had
acknowledged
the
services
of
the
famous
tenth
and
the
colonel
had
eulogized
the
good
old
state
the
latter
spoke
of
the
vacant
in
the
regiment
and
asked
that
it
might
be
given
to
colburne
but
i
have
promised
that
to
gazaway
said
the
governor
looking
slightly
troubled
to
gazaway
roared
carter
in
wrathful
astonishment
what
to
the
same
gazaway
why
governor
are
you
aware
are
you
perfectly
aware
why
he
left
the
regiment
the
governor
countenance
became
still
more
troubled
but
did
not
lose
its
habitual
expression
of
mild
obstinacy
i
know
i
know
he
said
softly
it
is
a
very
miserable
affair
miserable
it
is
to
the
last
degree
scandalous
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
utterly
contemptible
as
this
fellow
behavior
you
certainly
can
not
know
if
you
did
you
would
think
of
letting
this
infernal
poltroon
back
into
the
regiment
he
ought
to
have
been
it
is
a
cursed
shame
that
he
was
not
shot
for
misbehavior
in
presence
of
the
enemy
let
me
tell
you
his
story
the
governor
had
an
air
which
seemed
to
say
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
tell
him
anything
but
he
folded
his
hands
bowed
his
head
crossed
his
legs
put
a
pastille
in
his
mouth
and
meekly
composed
himself
to
listen
this
gazaway
is
the
greatest
coward
that
i
ever
saw
pursued
the
colonel
i
positively
think
he
must
be
the
greatest
coward
that
ever
lived
at
georgia
landing
he
left
his
horse
and
dodged
and
ducked
and
squatted
behind
the
line
in
such
a
contemptible
way
that
i
came
near
rapping
him
over
the
head
with
the
flat
of
my
sabre
at
camp
beasland
he
shammed
sick
and
skulked
about
the
hospitals
whimpering
for
medicine
i
sent
in
charges
against
him
then
but
they
got
lost
i
believe
on
the
march
at
any
rate
they
never
turned
up
at
port
hudson
i
released
him
from
arrest
and
ordered
him
into
the
fight
hoping
he
would
get
shot
i
privately
told
the
surgeon
not
to
excuse
him
and
i
told
the
blackguard
himself
that
he
must
face
the
music
but
he
ran
away
the
moment
the
brigade
came
under
fire
he
was
picked
up
at
the
hospital
by
the
and
sent
to
the
regiment
in
its
advanced
position
the
officers
refused
to
obey
his
orders
unless
he
proved
his
courage
first
by
taking
a
rifle
and
fighting
in
the
trenches
they
equipped
him
but
he
would
fight
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
said
he
did
know
how
to
load
his
gun
said
he
was
sick
cried
then
they
kicked
him
out
of
camp
actually
and
literally
booted
him
out
put
the
leather
to
him
sir
that
is
the
last
time
that
he
was
seen
with
the
regiment
he
was
next
picked
up
in
the
hospitals
of
new
orleans
and
sent
to
the
front
by
emory
who
would
have
shot
him
if
he
had
known
what
he
was
he
was
in
command
of
fort
winthrop
and
wanted
to
surrender
at
the
first
summons
nothing
but
the
high
spirit
of
his
officers
and
the
gallantry
of
the
whole
garrison
saved
the
fort
from
its
own
commander
i
tell
you
sir
that
he
is
a
redemptionless
sneak
he
is
a
disgrace
to
the
regiment
and
to
the
state
and
to
the
country
he
is
a
disgrace
to
every
man
in
both
services
to
every
man
who
calls
himself
an
american
and
you
propose
to
restore
him
to
the
regiment
the
governor
sighed
and
looked
very
sad
but
at
the
same
time
as
meekly
determined
as
moses
my
dear
colonel
i
knew
it
all
he
said
but
i
think
i
am
right
i
think
i
am
acting
out
our
american
principle
the
greatest
good
of
the
greatest
number
i
must
beg
your
patient
hearing
and
your
secrecy
in
the
first
place
gazaway
is
not
to
keep
the
commission
it
is
merely
given
to
whitewash
him
he
will
accept
it
and
then
resign
it
that
is
all
understood
but
what
the
do
you
want
to
whitewash
him
for
he
ought
to
be
gibbeted
i
know
very
true
but
see
here
we
carry
the
elections
we
have
the
government
supported
by
the
people
we
give
the
administration
a
clear
majority
in
both
houses
of
congress
otherwise
you
see
copperheadism
and
secession
false
peace
and
rebellion
will
triumph
but
the
way
to
carry
the
elections
is
to
whip
the
rebels
my
god
to
have
the
best
officers
and
the
best
army
and
win
all
the
victories
my
god
the
governor
smiled
as
if
from
habit
but
pursued
his
own
course
of
reasoning
resolutely
without
noticing
the
new
argument
his
spunk
was
rising
a
little
and
he
had
no
small
amount
of
domination
in
him
notwithstanding
his
amiability
now
gazaway
congressional
district
is
a
close
one
he
continued
and
we
fear
that
his
assistance
is
necessary
to
enable
us
to
carry
it
i
grieve
to
think
that
it
is
so
it
is
not
our
fault
it
is
the
fault
of
those
men
who
will
vote
a
disloyal
ticket
well
he
demands
that
we
shall
whitewash
him
by
giving
him
a
step
up
from
his
old
commission
on
that
condition
he
agrees
to
insure
us
the
district
then
he
is
to
resign
my
god
what
a
disgraceful
muddle
was
carter
indignant
comment
the
governor
looked
almost
provoked
at
seeing
that
the
colonel
would
not
appreciate
his
difficulties
and
necessities
i
sacrifice
my
own
feelings
in
this
matter
he
insisted
i
assure
you
that
it
is
a
most
painful
step
for
me
to
take
he
forgot
that
he
was
also
sacrificing
the
feelings
of
captain
colburne
and
of
other
deserving
officers
in
the
gallant
tenth
i
would
take
the
step
returned
the
colonel
i
let
the
election
go
to
hell
before
i
take
it
if
that
is
the
way
elections
are
carried
let
us
have
done
with
them
and
pray
for
a
despotism
after
this
speech
there
was
a
silence
of
some
minutes
each
of
these
men
was
a
wonder
to
the
other
each
of
them
ought
to
have
been
a
wonder
to
himself
the
governor
knew
that
carter
was
a
rou√©
a
hard
drinker
something
of
a
dugald
dalgetty
and
he
could
not
understand
his
professional
chivalry
his
passion
for
the
honor
of
the
service
his
bitter
hatred
of
cowards
the
colonel
knew
the
governor
upright
moral
character
as
an
individual
and
was
amazed
that
such
a
man
could
condescend
to
what
he
considered
dirty
trickery
in
one
respect
carter
had
the
highest
moral
standpoints
he
did
wrong
to
please
himself
but
it
was
under
the
pressure
of
overwhelming
impulse
and
he
paid
for
it
in
frank
remorse
the
other
did
wrong
after
calm
deliberation
sadly
regretting
the
alleged
necessity
but
chloroforming
his
conscience
with
the
plea
of
that
necessity
he
was
at
bottom
a
and
honorable
man
but
blinded
by
long
confinement
in
the
dark
labyrinths
of
political
intrigue
as
the
fishes
of
the
mammoth
cave
are
eyeless
through
the
lack
of
light
he
would
have
shrunk
with
horror
from
carter
had
he
known
of
that
affair
with
madame
larue
at
the
same
time
he
could
commission
a
known
coward
above
the
heads
of
heroes
to
carry
a
congressional
district
and
in
order
that
we
may
not
be
too
hard
upon
him
let
us
consider
his
difficulties
let
us
suppose
that
he
had
elevated
the
bayard
and
thrown
the
bardolph
overboard
in
the
first
place
all
the
of
his
following
would
have
been
down
upon
him
with
arguments
and
appeals
begging
him
in
the
name
of
the
party
of
the
country
of
liberty
not
to
lose
the
election
his
own
candidate
in
the
doubtful
district
an
old
and
intimate
friend
would
have
said
you
have
ruined
my
chances
all
the
capitalists
and
manufacturers
who
depended
on
this
candidate
to
get
this
or
that
axe
sharpened
on
the
congressional
grindstone
would
have
added
their
outcries
to
the
lamentation
thinking
of
all
this
and
thinking
too
of
the
copperheads
and
what
they
would
be
sure
to
do
if
they
triumphed
he
felt
that
what
he
had
decided
on
was
for
the
best
and
that
he
must
do
it
gazaway
must
have
the
until
the
spring
election
was
over
and
then
and
not
before
he
must
make
way
for
some
honorable
man
and
brave
officer
but
how
can
this
fellow
have
such
a
political
influence
queried
the
colonel
it
ought
to
be
easy
enough
to
expose
him
in
the
newspapers
and
smash
him
the
two
hundred
men
or
so
who
vote
as
he
says
never
read
the
newspapers
and
would
believe
the
exposure
there
is
the
majority
left
observed
carter
after
another
pause
captain
colburne
might
have
that
if
he
would
take
promotion
under
gazaway
i
have
given
that
to
my
nephew
captain
rathbun
said
the
governor
blushing
he
was
not
ashamed
of
his
political
with
a
vulgar
coward
but
he
was
a
little
discomposed
at
confessing
his
very
pardonable
and
perhaps
justifiable
nepotism
captain
rathbun
he
pursued
hastily
has
been
strongly
recommended
by
all
the
superior
officers
of
his
corps
there
is
no
chance
of
promotion
in
the
cavalry
as
our
state
has
only
furnished
three
companies
i
have
therefore
transferred
him
to
the
infantry
and
i
placed
him
in
your
regiment
because
there
were
two
vacancies
then
my
recommendation
goes
for
nothing
said
carter
in
gloomy
discontent
really
colonel
i
must
have
some
authority
in
these
matters
i
am
called
of
the
forces
of
the
state
i
am
sorry
if
it
annoys
you
but
there
will
be
i
assure
you
there
will
soon
be
a
vacancy
for
captain
colburne
but
he
will
have
to
come
in
under
your
nephew
i
suppose
i
suppose
so
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
otherwise
but
it
will
be
no
disgrace
to
him
i
assure
you
he
will
find
major
rathbun
an
admirable
officer
and
a
comrade
perfectly
to
his
taste
he
graduated
from
the
university
only
a
year
after
captain
colburne
excuse
me
if
i
leave
you
for
half
an
hour
observed
carter
without
attempting
to
conceal
his
disgust
i
want
to
step
into
the
and
take
a
segar
certainly
bowed
the
governor
and
resumed
his
newspaper
he
was
used
to
such
unpleasant
interviews
as
this
and
after
drawing
a
tired
sigh
over
it
he
was
all
tranquillity
again
the
colonel
was
too
profoundly
infuriated
to
return
to
his
companion
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
much
as
he
wanted
his
influence
to
back
up
his
own
application
for
promotion
horrible
shame
by
jove
he
muttered
while
chewing
rather
than
smoking
his
segar
i
wish
the
whole
thing
was
in
the
hands
of
the
war
department
damn
the
states
and
their
rights
i
wish
by
this
and
that
that
we
were
centralized
thus
illogically
ruminated
the
west
pointer
not
seeing
that
the
good
is
not
bad
merely
because
it
may
be
abused
not
seeing
that
centralism
is
sure
to
be
more
corrupt
than
federalism
the
reader
knows
that
such
cases
as
that
of
gazaway
were
not
common
they
existed
but
they
were
exceptional
they
were
sporadic
and
not
symptomatic
in
general
the
military
nominations
of
the
governor
did
honor
to
his
heart
and
his
head
it
was
colburne
accidental
misfortune
that
his
state
contained
one
or
two
doubtful
districts
and
that
one
of
them
was
in
the
hands
or
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
hands
of
his
contemptible
superior
officer
in
almost
any
other
baratarian
regiment
the
intelligent
educated
brave
and
honorable
young
captain
would
have
been
sure
of
promotion
carter
was
troubled
with
a
foreboding
that
his
own
claims
would
meet
with
as
little
recognition
as
those
of
colburne
he
took
plain
whiskeys
at
nearly
every
and
reached
washington
more
than
half
drunk
but
still
in
low
spirits
sobered
and
rested
by
a
night
sleep
he
delivered
his
dispatches
was
bowed
out
by
general
halleck
and
then
sought
out
a
resident
congressional
friend
and
held
a
frank
colloquy
with
him
concerning
the
attainment
of
the
desired
star
you
see
colonel
that
you
are
a
marked
man
said
the
you
have
been
known
to
say
that
the
war
will
last
five
years
well
it
will
it
has
lasted
nearly
three
and
it
will
kick
for
two
more
i
ought
to
be
promoted
by
this
and
that
for
my
sagacity
just
so
laughed
the
but
you
wo
be
the
trouble
is
that
you
say
just
what
the
copperheads
say
and
you
get
credit
for
the
same
motives
it
is
urged
moreover
that
men
like
you
discourage
the
nation
and
cheer
the
rebels
by
jove
i
like
to
see
the
rebel
who
would
be
cheered
by
the
news
that
the
war
will
last
two
years
longer
the
honorable
member
laughed
again
in
recognition
of
the
hit
and
proceeded
then
there
is
that
old
filibustering
affair
when
you
went
into
that
you
were
not
so
good
a
prophet
as
you
are
now
and
in
fact
it
is
a
very
unfortunate
affair
at
present
it
stands
in
your
way
confoundedly
in
fact
you
are
not
a
favorite
with
our
left
wing
our
radicals
the
president
is
all
right
the
war
department
is
all
right
they
admit
your
faithfulness
ability
and
services
it
is
the
senate
that
knocks
you
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
wait
for
something
to
turn
up
in
fact
i
do
see
my
way
to
a
confirmation
yet
carter
swore
groaned
and
chewed
his
cigar
to
a
pulp
but
do
be
discouraged
pursued
the
we
have
brought
over
two
or
three
of
the
radicals
to
your
side
three
or
four
more
will
do
the
job
then
we
can
get
a
nomination
with
assurance
of
a
confirmation
i
promise
you
it
shall
be
attended
to
at
the
first
chance
but
you
must
come
out
strong
against
slavery
abolition
is
your
card
new
converts
must
be
zealous
you
know
by
jove
i
strong
i
did
believe
in
arming
the
negro
once
but
i
do
now
it
was
a
good
movement
i
take
a
black
brigade
will
you
then
you
can
have
a
white
one
i
guess
by
the
way
perhaps
you
can
do
something
for
yourself
a
good
many
of
the
members
are
in
town
already
i
take
you
around
show
you
to
friends
and
enemies
in
fact
you
can
do
something
for
yourself
carter
did
something
in
the
way
of
treating
giving
flattering
and
talking
smiling
outwardly
the
while
but
within
full
of
bitterness
it
seemed
to
him
a
gross
injustice
that
the
destiny
of
a
man
who
had
fought
should
be
ruled
by
people
who
slept
in
good
beds
every
night
and
had
never
heard
a
bullet
whistle
he
thought
that
he
was
demeaning
himself
by
bowing
down
to
members
of
congress
and
state
but
he
was
driven
to
it
by
his
professional
rage
for
promotion
and
still
more
urgently
by
the
necessity
of
increasing
his
income
when
he
left
washington
after
the
two
weeks
stay
which
was
permitted
to
him
his
nomination
to
a
brigadiership
was
promised
and
he
had
strong
hopes
of
obtaining
the
senatorial
confirmation
at
new
york
he
called
on
larue
he
had
not
meant
to
do
it
when
he
quitted
the
virtuous
capital
of
the
nation
but
as
he
approached
her
he
felt
drawn
towards
her
by
something
stronger
than
the
engine
moreover
he
thought
to
himself
that
she
might
do
something
for
his
promotion
if
she
could
be
induced
to
go
to
washington
and
try
the
ponderosity
of
the
united
states
senate
with
that
powerful
social
lever
of
hers
sainte
etc
why
did
you
tell
me
this
before
she
exclaimed
why
were
you
not
frank
with
me
i
would
have
gone
i
would
have
worked
day
and
night
for
you
i
would
have
had
such
fun
it
would
have
been
delicious
to
humbug
those
abolitionist
senators
i
would
have
been
the
ruin
of
sumnaire
and
weelsone
there
would
have
been
yet
more
books
dedicated
to
sainte
marie
madeleine
she
burst
into
a
laugh
at
these
jolly
ideas
and
waltzed
about
the
room
with
a
mimicry
of
in
her
eyes
and
gestures
but
i
can
not
go
alone
you
perceive
do
you
not
she
resumed
sitting
down
by
his
side
and
laying
one
hand
caressingly
on
his
shoulder
i
should
have
no
position
alone
and
there
is
not
the
time
for
me
to
create
one
moreover
i
have
paid
for
my
passage
to
new
orleans
in
the
mississippi
well
we
shall
be
together
said
carter
that
is
my
boat
but
what
a
cursed
fool
i
was
in
not
taking
you
to
washington
certainly
you
were
it
is
most
regrettable
it
is
as
far
as
these
two
were
concerned
the
voyage
south
was
much
like
the
latter
part
of
the
voyage
north
except
that
carter
suffered
less
from
and
was
generally
in
higher
spirits
he
had
not
money
enough
left
to
pay
for
his
meals
and
wine
but
he
did
not
hesitate
to
borrow
a
hundred
dollars
from
the
widow
and
she
lent
it
with
her
usual
amiability
you
shall
have
all
i
can
spare
she
said
i
only
wish
to
live
and
dress
il
you
are
always
welcome
to
what
remains
what
could
the
unfortunate
man
do
but
be
grateful
larue
began
to
govern
him
with
a
mild
and
insinuating
domination
and
strange
to
say
her
empire
was
not
altogether
injurious
she
corrected
him
of
a
number
of
the
bearish
ways
which
he
had
insensibly
acquired
by
life
in
the
army
and
which
his
wife
had
not
dared
to
call
his
attention
to
worshipping
him
too
sincerely
she
laughed
him
out
of
his
swearing
and
scolded
him
out
of
most
of
his
drinking
she
mended
his
stockings
trimmed
the
frayed
ends
of
his
necktie
saw
to
it
that
his
clothes
were
brushed
in
short
she
greatly
improved
his
personal
appearance
which
had
grown
somewhat
shabby
under
the
influences
of
travelling
and
carousing
for
the
colonel
was
one
of
those
innumerable
male
creatures
who
always
go
to
seediness
as
soon
as
womankind
ceases
to
care
for
them
with
him
she
had
no
more
need
of
coquetries
and
sentimental
prattle
and
she
treated
him
very
much
as
a
wife
of
five
years
standing
treats
her
husband
she
was
amiable
petting
slightly
exacting
slightly
critical
moderately
chatty
moderately
loving
they
led
a
peaceable
domestic
sort
of
life
without
much
regard
to
secrecy
without
much
terror
at
the
continual
danger
of
discovery
they
were
old
sinners
enough
to
feel
and
behave
much
like
innocent
people
remorse
it
must
be
observed
had
arisen
entirely
from
his
affection
for
his
wife
and
his
shame
at
having
proved
unworthy
of
her
affectionate
confidence
and
not
at
all
from
any
sense
of
doing
an
injury
to
larue
nor
from
a
tenderness
of
conscience
concerning
the
abstract
question
of
right
and
wrong
consequently
after
the
first
humiliation
of
his
fall
was
a
little
numbed
by
time
he
could
be
quite
comfortable
in
spirit
but
his
uneasiness
awakened
at
the
sight
of
lillie
and
the
pressure
of
her
joyful
embrace
the
meeting
affectionate
as
it
seemed
on
both
sides
gave
him
a
very
miserable
kind
of
happiness
he
did
not
turn
his
eyes
to
larue
who
stood
by
with
a
calm
pleased
smile
he
was
led
away
in
triumph
he
was
laid
on
the
best
sofa
and
worshipped
he
was
a
king
and
a
god
in
the
eyes
of
that
pure
wife
but
he
was
a
very
unhappy
and
shamefaced
deity
oh
what
charming
letters
you
wrote
whispered
lillie
how
good
you
were
to
write
so
often
and
to
write
such
sweet
things
they
were
such
a
comfort
to
me
carter
was
a
little
consoled
he
written
often
and
affectionately
he
had
tried
in
that
way
to
make
amends
for
a
concealed
wrong
and
he
was
heartily
glad
to
find
that
he
had
made
her
happy
oh
my
dear
child
he
said
i
am
so
delighted
if
i
have
given
you
any
pleasure
he
spoke
this
with
such
a
sigh
almost
a
groan
that
she
looked
at
him
in
wonder
and
anxiety
what
is
the
matter
my
darling
she
asked
what
makes
you
sad
have
you
failed
in
getting
your
promotion
never
mind
i
will
love
you
to
make
up
for
it
i
know
and
you
know
that
you
deserve
it
we
will
be
just
as
happy
perhaps
i
have
not
altogether
failed
he
replied
glad
to
change
the
subject
i
have
some
hopes
yet
of
getting
good
news
oh
that
will
be
so
delightful
wo
it
be
nice
to
be
prosperous
as
well
as
happy
i
shall
be
so
overjoyed
on
your
account
i
shall
be
too
proud
to
live
in
his
lonely
meditations
carter
frequently
tried
himself
at
the
bar
of
his
strange
conscience
and
struggled
hard
to
gain
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
what
could
a
fellow
do
he
asked
when
a
woman
would
persist
in
flinging
herself
at
his
head
he
honestly
thought
that
most
men
would
have
done
as
he
did
that
no
one
but
a
religious
fanatic
could
have
resisted
so
much
temptation
and
that
such
resistance
would
have
been
altogether
ungentlemanly
to
atone
for
his
wrong
he
was
most
tender
to
his
wife
he
followed
her
with
attentions
and
loaded
her
with
presents
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
a
guilt
upon
his
soul
which
might
have
killed
her
had
she
discovered
it
he
would
not
stint
her
wardrobe
nor
forget
to
kiss
her
every
time
he
went
out
nor
fail
to
bring
her
bouquets
every
evening
he
has
been
known
to
leave
his
bed
at
midnight
and
walk
the
street
for
hours
driving
away
dogs
whose
howling
prevented
her
from
sleeping
deeds
like
this
were
his
penance
his
expiation
his
consolation
he
was
now
on
duty
in
the
city
high
authority
determined
to
make
amends
for
the
neglect
with
which
this
excellent
officer
was
treated
offered
him
the
best
thing
which
it
had
now
to
give
the
of
the
department
of
the
gulf
his
pay
would
thereby
be
largely
increased
in
consequence
of
his
legal
commutations
for
rooms
and
fuel
besides
which
there
was
a
chance
of
securing
large
gleanings
from
such
a
broad
field
of
labor
and
responsibility
but
carter
realized
little
out
of
his
position
he
could
keep
his
accounts
of
government
property
correctly
but
except
in
his
knowledge
of
returns
and
vouchers
and
his
accuracy
he
was
not
properly
speaking
a
man
of
business
that
is
to
say
he
had
no
faculty
for
making
money
he
was
too
professionally
honorable
to
lend
government
funds
to
speculators
for
the
sake
of
a
share
of
the
profits
he
would
not
descend
to
the
trickery
of
getting
public
property
condemned
to
auction
and
then
buying
it
in
for
a
song
to
sell
it
at
an
advance
in
the
case
of
a
single
wagon
he
might
do
something
of
the
sort
in
order
to
rectify
his
balances
in
the
item
of
wagons
or
he
might
make
a
certificate
of
theft
in
a
small
affair
of
trousers
or
havresacks
which
had
been
lost
through
negligence
or
issued
without
a
receipt
but
to
such
straits
officers
were
frequently
driven
by
the
responsibility
system
he
sheltered
himself
under
the
plea
of
necessity
and
did
nothing
worse
in
fact
his
position
was
a
temptation
without
being
a
benefit
it
was
a
serious
temptation
a
great
deal
of
money
passed
through
his
hands
he
paid
out
and
received
on
account
of
the
government
thousands
of
dollars
daily
and
the
mere
handling
of
such
considerable
sums
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
a
great
capitalist
money
was
an
every
day
vulgar
commodity
and
he
spent
it
with
profusion
before
he
had
been
in
his
place
two
months
he
was
leaky
sinking
with
debts
no
one
hesitated
to
trust
a
man
who
had
charge
over
such
an
abounding
source
of
wealth
as
the
of
the
department
of
the
gulf
he
lived
sumptuously
drank
good
wines
smoked
the
best
cigars
and
marketed
for
the
ravenel
table
in
his
own
name
blaspheming
the
expense
whether
of
cost
or
credit
remembering
that
his
wife
needed
gentle
exercise
and
had
a
right
to
every
comfort
which
he
could
furnish
he
gave
her
a
carriage
and
pair
of
ponies
and
of
course
set
up
a
coachman
can
you
afford
it
my
dear
asked
lillie
a
little
anxious
for
she
was
aware
of
his
tendency
to
extravagance
i
can
afford
anything
my
little
one
rather
than
the
loss
of
you
replied
the
colonel
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
wanted
to
believe
that
all
was
well
and
therefore
the
task
of
convincing
her
was
easy
her
trust
was
constant
and
her
adoration
fervent
they
were
symptomatic
of
her
physical
condition
they
were
for
the
present
laws
of
her
nature
it
was
more
than
usually
painful
to
her
now
to
be
separated
long
from
her
deity
when
he
went
out
it
was
where
are
you
going
when
will
you
come
back
when
he
returned
it
was
how
long
you
have
been
gone
oh
i
though
you
would
come
an
hour
ago
it
was
childish
but
she
did
not
perceive
it
and
if
she
had
she
could
not
have
helped
it
she
clung
to
him
and
longed
after
him
because
she
must
there
was
a
bond
of
unity
between
them
which
clasped
her
inmost
life
meanwhile
how
about
larue
no
one
could
have
been
more
discreet
more
corruptly
sagacious
more
sunnily
amiable
than
this
singular
woman
she
petted
lillie
like
a
child
helped
her
in
her
abundant
sewing
labors
brought
her
as
many
bouquets
as
the
colonel
himself
scolded
her
for
imprudencies
forbade
this
dish
and
recommended
that
laughed
at
her
occasional
despondencies
and
cheered
her
as
women
know
how
to
cheer
each
other
she
seemed
like
the
truest
friend
of
the
young
woman
whom
she
would
not
have
hesitated
much
to
rob
of
her
husband
provided
she
could
have
wished
to
do
it
this
kindness
was
not
hypocrisy
but
simple
unforced
good
nature
it
was
natural
and
therefore
agreeable
to
her
to
be
amiable
and
as
she
always
did
what
she
liked
to
do
she
was
a
pattern
of
amiability
to
have
quarreled
seriously
with
lillie
would
have
been
a
downright
annoyance
to
her
and
consequently
she
avoided
every
chance
of
a
disagreement
so
far
at
least
as
was
consistent
with
her
private
pleasures
she
had
not
the
slightest
notion
of
eloping
with
the
colonel
she
did
not
take
passions
sufficiently
grand
for
that
she
would
not
have
isolated
herself
from
society
for
any
man
notwithstanding
larue
sugar
mask
lillie
was
at
times
disposed
to
fight
her
not
however
in
the
slightest
degree
on
account
of
her
husband
only
on
account
of
her
father
the
sly
creole
partly
for
her
own
amusement
indeed
but
chiefly
to
divert
suspicion
from
her
familiarity
with
carter
commenced
a
coquettish
attack
upon
the
doctor
lillie
was
sometimes
in
a
desperate
fright
lest
she
should
entrap
him
into
a
marriage
she
thought
that
she
understood
larue
perfectly
and
she
felt
quite
certain
that
she
was
by
no
means
good
enough
for
her
father
in
her
estimation
there
never
was
a
man
unless
it
might
be
her
husband
who
was
so
good
so
noble
so
charming
as
this
parent
of
hers
and
if
she
had
been
called
on
to
select
a
wife
for
him
i
doubt
whether
any
woman
could
have
passed
the
examination
to
which
she
would
have
subjected
the
candidates
i
perfectly
spoil
you
papa
she
said
laughing
i
pet
you
and
admire
you
till
i
suppose
i
shall
end
by
ruining
you
if
ever
you
go
out
into
the
world
alone
what
will
become
of
you
you
will
miss
my
care
dreadfully
you
must
leave
me
it
for
your
own
good
hear
you
must
trust
yourself
to
anybody
else
hear
i
hear
my
child
answers
the
doctor
what
a
charming
little
gold
coast
accent
you
have
pshaw
it
is
negro
at
all
everybody
talks
so
but
i
wonder
if
you
are
trying
to
change
the
subject
really
i
was
aware
of
a
subject
being
presented
for
my
consideration
oh
you
do
understand
or
you
wo
understand
i
do
believe
you
have
a
guilty
conscience
a
guilty
conscience
about
what
my
child
have
the
kindness
to
speak
plainly
my
mind
is
getting
feeble
ai
you
ashamed
to
ask
me
to
speak
plainly
i
do
want
to
speak
plainly
do
you
actually
want
to
have
me
if
it
would
overpower
your
reason
i
should
like
it
it
would
be
such
a
convenience
to
me
well
i
mean
papa
said
lillie
coloring
at
her
audacity
that
i
do
like
mrs
larue
do
like
larue
why
she
is
as
kind
to
you
as
she
can
possibly
be
i
thought
you
were
on
the
best
of
terms
i
mean
that
i
do
like
her
well
enough
to
call
her
mamma
call
her
mamma
repeated
the
doctor
staring
over
his
spectacles
in
amazement
you
do
mean
upon
my
honor
you
are
too
nonsensical
lillie
am
i
oh
i
am
so
delighted
exclaimed
lillie
eagerly
but
i
so
afraid
do
you
think
i
am
in
my
dotage
inquired
the
doctor
almost
indignant
no
no
papa
do
be
vexed
with
me
i
dare
say
it
was
very
absurd
in
me
but
i
do
think
she
is
so
artful
and
designing
she
is
a
curious
woman
we
know
observed
ravenel
she
certainly
has
some
peculiarities
lillie
laughed
outright
and
said
oh
yes
with
a
gay
little
air
of
satire
but
she
is
too
young
to
think
of
me
pursued
the
doctor
she
ca
be
more
than
papa
protested
lillie
she
is
thir
ty
have
you
lost
your
memory
thirty
is
it
possible
really
i
am
growing
old
i
am
constantly
understating
other
people
ages
i
have
caught
myself
at
it
repeatedly
i
do
know
whether
it
is
forgetfulness
or
inability
to
realize
the
flight
of
time
or
an
instinctive
effort
to
make
myself
out
a
modern
by
showing
that
my
intimates
are
youthful
but
i
am
constantly
doing
it
do
you
recollect
how
i
have
laughed
about
elderkin
for
this
same
trick
he
is
always
relating
anecdotes
of
his
youth
in
a
way
which
would
lead
you
to
suppose
that
the
events
happened
some
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ago
and
yet
he
is
seventy
i
must
laugh
at
elderkin
any
more
nonsense
said
lillie
you
are
not
a
bit
like
him
he
blacks
his
hair
to
correspond
with
his
dates
he
means
to
humbug
people
and
then
you
are
not
old
but
to
return
to
larue
observed
the
doctor
she
has
a
clear
head
she
is
pretty
sensible
she
is
not
a
woman
to
put
herself
in
a
false
or
ridiculous
position
i
really
have
not
observed
anything
of
what
you
hint
oh
no
of
course
not
men
never
do
they
are
stupid
of
course
you
would
observe
anything
until
she
went
on
her
knees
and
made
you
a
formal
declaration
i
was
afraid
you
might
say
in
your
surprise
my
dear
do
talk
in
that
way
of
a
lady
you
degrade
your
own
sex
by
such
jesting
however
the
doctor
did
in
a
quiet
way
put
himself
on
his
guard
against
larue
and
lillie
observing
this
did
also
in
a
quiet
way
feel
quite
elated
over
the
condition
of
things
in
the
family
she
was
as
happy
as
she
had
ever
been
or
could
desire
to
be
it
was
a
shocking
state
of
deception
corruption
lilied
over
with
decorum
and
smiling
amiability
whited
sepulchres
apples
of
sodom
blooming
upas
carter
saw
larue
as
often
as
he
wanted
and
even
much
oftener
in
a
private
room
which
even
his
wife
did
not
know
of
in
rear
of
his
offices
closely
veiled
she
slipped
in
by
a
back
entrance
and
reappeared
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
or
an
hour
or
perhaps
two
hours
it
was
after
such
interviews
had
taken
place
that
his
wife
welcomed
him
with
those
touching
words
oh
where
have
you
been
i
thought
you
never
would
come
he
would
have
been
glad
to
break
the
evil
charm
but
he
was
too
far
gone
to
be
capable
of
virtuous
effort
chapter
xxix
lillie
reaches
the
apotheosis
of
womanhood
woman
is
more
intimately
and
irresponsibly
a
child
of
nature
than
man
she
comes
oftener
more
completely
and
more
evidently
under
the
power
of
influences
which
she
can
neither
direct
nor
resist
and
which
make
use
of
her
without
consulting
her
inclination
her
part
then
is
passive
obedience
and
uncomplaining
suffering
while
through
her
the
ends
of
life
are
accomplished
she
has
no
choice
but
to
accept
her
beneficent
martyrdom
like
jesus
of
nazareth
she
agonizes
that
others
may
live
but
unlike
him
she
is
impelled
to
it
by
a
will
higher
than
her
own
at
the
same
time
a
loving
spirit
is
given
to
her
so
that
she
is
consoled
in
her
own
anguish
and
does
not
seriously
desire
that
the
cup
may
pass
from
her
before
she
has
drunk
it
to
the
dregs
she
has
the
patience
of
the
lower
animals
and
of
inanimate
nature
ennobled
by
a
heavenly
joy
of
a
divine
pleasure
in
suffering
for
those
whom
she
loves
she
is
both
lower
and
higher
than
man
by
instinct
rather
than
by
reason
from
necessity
rather
than
from
choice
there
came
a
day
to
lillie
during
which
she
lay
between
two
worlds
not
caring
which
she
entered
submissive
to
whatever
might
be
patient
though
weeping
with
pain
her
father
did
not
dare
trust
her
to
his
own
care
but
called
in
his
old
friend
and
colleague
doctor
elderkin
these
two
with
carter
larue
and
a
hired
nurse
did
not
quit
the
house
for
hours
and
all
but
the
husband
and
father
were
almost
constantly
in
the
room
of
the
invalid
the
struggle
was
so
long
and
severe
that
they
thought
it
would
end
in
death
neither
larue
nor
the
nurse
slept
during
the
whole
night
but
relieved
each
other
at
the
bedside
holding
by
turns
the
quivering
clutching
hand
of
lillie
and
fanning
the
crimson
cheeks
and
the
brow
covered
with
a
cold
sweat
as
of
a
death
agony
the
latent
womanliness
of
larue
the
tenderness
which
did
actually
exist
in
some
small
measure
beneath
her
smooth
surface
of
amiability
and
coquetry
was
profoundly
stirred
by
her
instinctive
sympathy
for
a
suffering
which
was
all
feminine
she
remembered
that
same
anguish
in
her
own
life
and
lived
it
over
again
every
throe
of
the
sick
girl
seemed
to
penetrate
her
own
body
she
thought
of
the
child
which
had
been
given
and
taken
years
ago
and
then
she
wiped
away
a
tear
lest
lillie
might
see
it
and
fear
for
herself
when
she
was
not
by
the
bedside
she
stood
at
the
window
now
looking
for
a
glimpse
of
dawn
as
if
that
could
bring
any
hope
and
then
turning
to
gaze
at
the
tossing
invalid
the
doctor
only
once
allowed
carter
to
enter
the
room
the
very
expansion
of
lillie
at
sight
of
him
the
eagerness
with
which
her
soul
reached
out
to
him
for
help
pity
love
was
perilous
there
was
danger
that
she
might
say
my
dear
and
in
the
exaltation
of
such
an
impulse
she
might
have
departed
as
for
him
he
had
never
before
witnessed
a
scene
like
this
and
he
never
forgot
it
his
wife
held
both
his
hands
clasping
them
spasmodically
a
broad
spot
of
fever
in
either
cheek
the
veins
of
her
forehead
swollen
and
her
neck
suffused
her
eyes
preternaturally
open
and
never
removed
from
his
her
whole
expression
radiant
with
agony
the
mortal
pain
the
supernatural
expectation
the
light
of
that
other
world
which
was
so
near
spiritualized
her
face
and
made
it
unhumanly
beautiful
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
standing
on
earth
and
joining
hands
with
her
in
heaven
he
had
never
before
reached
so
far
never
so
communed
with
another
life
his
own
face
was
all
of
this
world
stern
with
anxiety
and
perhaps
remorse
for
the
moment
was
so
agitating
and
imperious
that
he
could
not
direct
his
emotions
nor
veil
his
expression
happy
for
her
that
she
had
no
suspicion
of
one
thing
which
was
in
his
heart
she
believed
that
he
was
solely
tortured
by
fear
that
she
would
die
and
if
she
could
have
thought
to
speak
she
would
have
comforted
him
on
her
own
account
she
did
not
desire
to
live
only
for
his
sake
and
for
her
father
and
perhaps
a
little
for
her
child
the
old
doctor
watched
her
shook
his
head
signed
to
the
husband
to
leave
the
room
and
took
his
wife
hands
in
his
place
as
carter
went
out
larue
followed
him
a
few
steps
into
the
passage
what
is
between
you
and
me
must
end
she
whispered
yes
he
replied
in
the
same
tone
and
went
to
his
room
somewhat
comforted
at
seven
in
the
morning
he
was
awakened
by
a
tremulous
knocking
at
his
door
springing
from
the
sofa
on
which
he
had
dozed
for
an
hour
or
two
without
undressing
he
opened
and
encountered
larue
pale
with
sleeplessness
but
smiling
gaily
she
said
speaking
her
mother
tongue
in
her
haste
and
hastened
noiselessly
like
a
swift
sprite
back
to
the
sick
room
carter
followed
entered
with
a
sense
of
awe
passed
softly
around
the
screen
which
half
encircled
the
bed
and
saw
his
wife
and
child
lying
side
by
side
lillie
was
very
pale
her
face
was
still
spiritualized
by
the
gethsemane
of
the
night
but
her
eyes
were
still
radiant
with
a
purely
human
happiness
she
was
in
eager
haste
to
have
him
drink
at
the
fountain
of
joy
even
as
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
she
could
not
wait
but
turned
her
head
towards
the
infant
with
a
smile
of
exultation
and
said
look
at
him
but
how
are
he
asked
anxiously
for
a
man
does
not
at
once
forget
his
wife
in
his
offspring
and
carter
had
a
stain
of
remorse
on
his
soul
which
he
needed
to
wash
away
with
rivers
of
tenderness
oh
i
am
perfectly
well
she
answered
is
he
pretty
at
that
moment
the
child
sneezed
the
air
of
this
world
was
too
pungent
oh
take
him
she
exclaimed
looking
for
the
nurse
he
is
going
to
die
the
black
woman
lifted
the
boy
and
handed
him
to
the
father
do
drop
him
said
lillie
are
you
sure
you
can
hold
him
i
would
dare
to
take
him
as
if
she
could
have
taken
him
in
her
eagerness
she
forgot
that
she
was
sick
and
talked
as
if
she
were
in
her
full
strength
her
eyes
followed
the
infant
so
uneasily
about
the
room
that
elderkin
motioned
carter
to
replace
him
on
the
bed
now
he
wo
fall
she
said
it
was
only
a
sneeze
she
added
presently
with
a
little
laugh
which
was
like
a
gurgle
a
purr
of
happiness
i
thought
something
was
the
matter
with
him
shortly
afterward
she
asked
how
soon
will
he
talk
i
am
afraid
not
for
two
or
three
weeks
unless
the
weather
is
favorable
replied
elderkin
with
a
chuckle
which
under
the
circumstances
was
almost
blasphemous
how
strange
that
he
ca
talk
she
replied
without
noticing
the
old
gentleman
joke
he
looks
so
intelligent
she
would
be
a
bit
surprised
to
hear
him
sing
an
italian
opera
said
ravenel
she
has
seen
a
miracle
nothing
could
astonish
her
lillie
did
not
laugh
nor
answer
nothing
interested
her
which
did
not
say
baby
baby
was
for
the
time
the
whole
thought
the
whole
life
of
this
girl
who
a
little
previous
existed
through
her
husband
and
before
that
through
her
father
each
passion
had
been
stronger
than
its
predecessor
but
now
she
had
reached
the
culminating
point
of
her
womanhood
higher
than
baby
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
go
even
her
father
distressed
and
alarmed
her
a
little
by
an
affection
for
the
divinity
which
lacked
what
she
felt
to
be
the
proper
reverence
not
content
with
worshiping
afar
off
he
picked
up
the
tiny
god
and
carried
him
to
the
partial
day
of
a
curtained
window
desiring
as
he
said
the
honor
of
being
the
first
to
give
him
an
idea
the
first
to
give
him
an
idea
laughed
the
father
why
he
looks
as
if
he
had
been
thinking
for
centuries
he
looks
five
thousand
years
old
seeing
that
lillie
began
to
weary
the
old
doctor
replaced
the
deity
on
the
pillow
which
served
him
for
an
altar
and
turned
the
male
worshipers
out
of
the
room
how
delighted
they
are
with
him
she
said
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
them
doctor
is
he
an
uncommonly
handsome
child
she
added
with
the
adorable
simplicity
of
perfect
love
i
thought
babies
were
not
pretty
at
first
the
room
was
now
kept
still
the
mother
and
child
lay
side
by
side
reposing
from
their
struggle
for
life
the
mother
looked
steadily
at
the
infant
the
infant
looked
with
equal
fixity
at
the
window
each
gazed
and
wondered
at
an
unaccustomed
glory
in
a
few
minutes
both
dropped
to
sleep
overcome
by
fatigue
and
by
novel
emotions
or
sensations
for
three
days
a
succession
of
long
slumbers
and
of
waking
intervals
similar
to
tranquilly
delightful
dreams
composed
their
existence
when
they
were
thus
reposed
they
tasted
life
with
a
more
complete
and
delicious
zest
lillie
entertained
her
husband
and
father
for
hours
at
a
time
with
discoursing
on
the
attributes
of
the
baby
pointing
out
the
different
elements
of
his
glory
and
showing
how
he
grew
in
graces
she
was
quite
indifferent
to
their
affectionate
raillery
nothing
could
shake
her
faith
in
the
illimitability
of
the
new
deity
they
two
dear
as
they
were
were
nevertheless
human
and
were
not
so
necessary
as
they
had
been
to
her
faith
in
goodness
and
her
happiness
in
loving
so
long
as
she
had
the
baby
to
look
at
she
could
pass
the
whole
day
without
them
hardly
wondering
at
their
absence
we
are
dethroned
said
the
doctor
to
the
colonel
we
are
a
couple
of
saturns
who
have
made
way
for
the
jupiter
nonsense
smiled
lillie
you
think
that
you
are
going
to
spend
all
your
time
with
your
minerals
now
you
are
perfectly
happy
in
the
idea
i
allow
it
no
we
must
remain
and
be
converts
to
the
new
revelation
well
i
suppose
we
resist
we
are
ready
to
make
our
profession
of
faith
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
this
is
the
place
said
lillie
is
he
sweet
the
grandfather
knew
a
great
deal
better
than
either
the
father
or
mother
how
to
handle
the
diminutive
jupiter
he
took
him
from
the
pillow
carried
him
to
the
window
drew
the
curtain
slowly
and
laughed
to
see
the
solemn
little
eyes
after
winking
slowly
turn
upward
and
fix
themselves
steadily
on
the
broad
mild
effulgence
of
the
sky
he
looks
for
the
light
as
plants
and
trees
lean
towards
it
said
he
he
is
trying
to
see
the
heavenly
mansions
which
he
may
some
day
inhabit
nobody
knows
how
soon
they
get
up
their
chariots
very
suddenly
sometimes
these
little
elijahs
oh
do
talk
so
implored
lillie
he
die
the
doctor
was
thinking
of
his
own
only
boy
who
had
flown
from
the
cradle
to
heaven
more
than
twenty
years
ago
aside
from
tenderness
for
his
wife
carter
principal
emotion
all
this
while
was
that
of
astonishment
at
his
position
it
cost
him
considerable
mental
effort
and
stretch
of
imagination
to
conceive
himself
a
relative
of
the
newcomer
he
did
not
like
lillie
love
the
child
by
passionate
instinct
and
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
love
him
as
he
had
learned
to
love
her
he
was
tender
of
the
infant
as
a
creature
whose
weakness
pleaded
for
his
protection
but
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
affection
he
had
to
confess
that
he
loved
him
chiefly
through
his
mother
he
was
a
poor
hand
at
fondling
the
boy
being
always
afraid
of
doing
him
some
harm
he
was
better
pleased
to
see
him
in
lillie
arms
than
to
feel
him
in
his
own
the
little
burden
was
curiously
warm
and
soft
but
so
evidently
susceptible
to
injury
as
to
be
a
terror
i
would
rather
lead
a
storming
party
he
said
i
have
been
beaten
in
that
sort
of
thing
and
lived
through
it
but
if
i
should
drop
this
fellow
and
here
the
warrior
absolutely
flinched
at
the
thought
of
how
he
would
feel
in
such
a
horrible
case
now
commenced
a
beautiful
reciprocal
education
of
mother
and
child
each
discovered
every
day
new
mysteries
new
causes
of
admiration
and
love
in
the
other
long
before
a
childless
man
or
even
woman
would
have
imagined
signs
of
intelligence
in
the
infant
the
mother
had
not
merely
imagined
but
had
actually
discovered
them
you
would
have
been
wrong
if
you
had
laughed
incredulously
when
she
said
he
begins
to
take
notice
of
course
her
fondness
led
her
into
errors
she
mistook
symptoms
of
mere
sensation
for
utterances
of
ideas
she
perceived
prophetically
rather
than
by
actual
observation
but
some
things
some
opening
buds
of
intellect
she
saw
truly
she
deceived
herself
when
she
thought
that
at
the
age
of
three
weeks
he
knew
his
father
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
quite
correct
in
believing
that
he
recognized
and
cried
for
his
mother
this
delighted
her
she
would
let
him
cry
for
a
moment
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
being
so
desired
then
she
would
fold
him
to
her
breast
and
be
his
comforter
his
life
they
were
teachers
consolers
deities
the
one
to
the
other
her
love
gave
a
fresh
inspiration
to
her
religious
feeling
here
was
a
new
object
of
thanksgiving
and
prayer
an
object
so
nearly
divine
that
only
heaven
could
have
sent
it
an
object
so
delicate
that
only
heaven
could
preserve
it
for
her
baby
she
prayed
with
an
intelligence
a
feeling
a
faith
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
not
even
when
praying
for
her
husband
during
his
times
of
battle
it
seemed
certain
to
her
that
the
merciful
and
the
son
who
gave
himself
for
the
world
would
sympathize
compassionately
with
the
innocence
and
helplessness
of
her
little
child
these
sentiments
were
not
violent
she
would
have
withered
under
the
breath
of
any
passionate
emotion
they
were
as
gentle
and
comforting
as
summer
breezes
from
orange
groves
once
only
during
a
slight
accession
of
fever
there
came
something
like
a
physical
revelation
a
room
full
of
mysterious
dazzling
light
a
communication
of
some
surprising
unutterable
joy
an
impression
as
of
a
divine
voice
saying
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
forgiven
of
god
she
wished
also
to
be
forgiven
of
man
the
next
morning
moved
by
the
remembrance
of
the
vision
although
its
exaltation
had
nearly
vanished
with
the
fall
of
the
fever
she
beckoned
her
husband
to
her
and
with
tears
begged
his
pardon
for
some
long
since
forgotten
petulance
this
was
the
hardest
trial
that
carter
had
yet
undergone
to
have
her
plead
for
his
forgiveness
was
a
reproach
that
he
could
hardly
bear
with
he
must
not
confess
no
such
relief
was
there
for
his
burdened
spirit
but
he
sank
on
his
knees
in
miserable
penitence
oh
forgive
me
he
said
i
am
not
half
good
enough
for
you
i
am
not
worthy
of
your
love
you
must
pray
for
me
my
darling
for
the
time
she
was
his
religion
his
loving
chastening
though
not
deity
uplifting
and
purifying
him
even
as
she
was
exalted
and
sanctified
by
her
child
her
happiness
was
checkered
by
some
troubles
it
was
hard
not
to
stir
not
to
be
able
to
help
herself
not
to
tend
the
baby
when
her
face
was
washed
for
her
by
the
nurse
there
would
be
places
where
it
was
not
thoroughly
dried
and
which
she
sought
to
wipe
by
rubbing
against
the
pillow
after
a
few
trials
of
this
sort
she
forbade
the
nurse
to
touch
her
and
installed
her
husband
in
the
duty
it
was
actually
a
comfort
to
him
to
seek
to
humiliate
himself
by
these
services
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
thereby
earning
forgiveness
for
the
crime
which
he
dared
not
confess
he
washed
her
face
took
her
meals
in
and
put
them
out
fed
her
with
his
own
hands
fanned
her
by
the
hour
and
all
she
thought
as
no
one
else
could
how
gentle
you
are
she
said
her
eyes
suddenly
moistening
with
gratitude
how
nicely
you
wait
on
me
and
to
think
that
you
have
led
a
storming
party
and
i
have
seen
men
afraid
of
you
my
dear
what
did
you
ever
mean
by
saying
that
you
are
not
good
enough
for
me
you
are
a
hundred
times
better
than
i
deserve
carter
laid
his
forehead
in
her
gently
clasping
hands
without
speaking
what
are
you
going
to
call
him
he
asked
presently
why
ravenel
did
you
know
she
answered
with
a
smile
she
had
been
calling
him
ravenel
to
herself
for
several
days
without
telling
any
one
of
it
it
was
a
pleasure
to
think
that
she
alone
knew
his
name
that
she
had
so
much
in
him
of
an
unshared
secret
possession
ravenel
carter
she
repeated
we
can
make
that
into
ravvie
do
you
like
it
i
do
he
answered
it
is
the
best
name
possible
it
contains
the
name
of
at
least
one
good
man
of
two
good
men
she
insisted
a
good
husband
and
a
good
father
her
first
drive
in
the
pony
carriage
was
an
ecstacy
by
her
side
sat
the
nurse
holding
ravvie
and
opposite
sat
her
husband
and
father
presently
she
made
the
colonel
and
the
nurse
change
places
i
want
my
child
where
i
can
see
him
and
my
husband
where
i
can
lean
against
him
she
said
i
do
come
in
observed
the
doctor
i
am
monsieur
de
trop
no
account
no
you
are
not
i
want
you
to
look
at
ravvie
and
me
soon
she
was
anxious
lest
the
child
should
catch
cold
by
riding
backwards
no
more
danger
one
way
than
the
other
said
the
doctor
the
back
of
his
head
goes
all
around
i
dare
say
his
hair
will
protect
him
wo
it
she
asked
his
hair
is
about
as
heavy
as
his
whiskers
laughed
the
doctor
he
is
in
no
danger
of
absalom
fate
the
nurse
having
pulled
up
a
shawl
in
rear
of
the
little
bobbing
head
lillie
was
satisfied
and
could
turn
her
attention
to
other
things
she
laid
her
slender
hand
on
her
husband
knee
nestled
against
his
strong
shoulder
and
said
is
it
lovely
is
the
whole
world
beautiful
they
had
taken
the
nearest
cut
out
of
the
city
and
were
passing
a
suburban
mansion
the
front
yard
of
which
was
full
of
orange
trees
and
flowers
a
few
weeks
before
she
would
have
wanted
to
steal
the
flowers
now
she
eagerly
asked
her
husband
to
get
out
and
beg
for
some
when
he
returned
with
a
gorgeous
bouquet
she
was
full
of
gratitude
exclaiming
oh
how
lovely
did
you
thank
the
people
i
am
so
obliged
to
them
did
they
see
the
child
in
the
carriage
yes
said
the
colonel
smiling
with
pleasure
at
her
na√Øve
delight
the
lady
saw
the
child
and
said
this
rose
was
for
him
accordingly
the
rose
carefully
stripped
of
all
thorns
was
put
into
the
dimpled
fist
of
ravvie
who
of
course
proceeded
to
suck
it
he
is
smelling
of
it
cried
lillie
with
a
charming
faith
in
the
little
god
precocity
he
is
trying
it
by
his
universal
test
his
crucible
said
the
doctor
everything
must
go
into
that
mouth
it
is
his
only
medium
for
acquiring
knowledge
at
present
if
it
was
large
enough
and
he
could
reach
far
enough
he
would
investigate
the
nature
of
the
solar
system
by
means
of
it
it
is
lucky
for
the
world
that
he
is
not
sufficiently
big
to
put
the
sun
in
his
mouth
we
should
certainly
find
ourselves
in
darkness
not
to
mention
that
he
might
burn
himself
my
dear
i
am
afraid
he
will
swallow
some
of
the
leaves
he
added
we
must
interfere
this
is
one
of
the
emergencies
when
a
grandfather
has
a
right
to
exercise
authority
the
rose
was
gently
detached
from
ravvie
fat
grasp
and
stuck
in
his
little
silk
bonnet
his
eyes
following
it
till
it
disappeared
you
see
he
is
an
eating
animal
continued
the
doctor
that
is
pretty
much
all
at
present
and
that
is
enough
he
has
no
need
of
any
more
wisdom
than
what
will
enable
him
to
demand
nourishment
and
dispose
of
it
and
god
in
his
great
kindness
towards
infants
has
not
troubled
him
with
any
further
revelations
so
far
god
has
provided
us
to
do
all
the
necessary
thinking
in
his
case
the
infant
is
a
mere
swallower
digestor
and
assimilator
he
knows
how
to
convert
other
substances
into
himself
he
does
it
with
energy
singleness
of
purpose
perseverance
and
wonderful
success
nothing
more
is
requisite
in
eating
he
is
performing
the
whole
duty
of
man
at
his
age
so
far
as
he
goes
he
is
a
masterpiece
but
you
are
making
a
machine
of
him
an
oyster
protested
lillie
very
like
said
the
doctor
very
like
an
oyster
his
existence
has
a
simplicity
and
unity
very
similar
to
that
of
the
lower
orders
of
creation
of
course
i
am
not
speaking
of
his
possibilities
they
are
spiritual
grand
perhaps
gigantic
if
you
could
see
the
inferior
face
of
his
brain
you
would
be
able
to
perceive
even
now
the
magnificent
capacities
of
the
as
yet
untuned
instrument
oh
do
papa
implored
lillie
you
trouble
me
do
they
ever
dissect
babies
not
such
lively
ones
as
this
said
the
doctor
and
proceeded
to
change
the
subject
i
never
saw
a
healthier
creature
i
should
wonder
if
he
survived
this
war
which
you
used
to
say
would
last
forty
years
perhaps
he
will
be
the
man
to
finish
it
i
do
say
so
now
i
did
think
my
husband
would
be
on
the
union
side
when
i
said
that
i
think
we
shall
beat
them
now
since
the
miracle
all
other
things
seem
possible
philosophised
the
doctor
i
do
not
repeat
the
colonel
talk
it
was
not
so
appropriate
as
that
of
the
others
to
the
occasion
for
he
knew
little
as
yet
of
the
profounder
depths
of
womanly
and
infantile
nature
his
first
marriage
had
been
brief
and
childless
in
fact
carter
was
rather
a
silent
man
in
family
conclaves
unless
the
conversation
turned
on
some
branch
of
his
profession
or
the
matters
of
ordinary
existence
he
occupied
himself
with
watching
alternately
his
wife
and
child
with
wrapping
up
the
former
and
occasionally
fondling
the
latter
how
very
warm
he
feels
how
amazingly
he
pulls
hair
i
believe
he
wants
to
get
my
head
in
his
mouth
are
samples
of
his
observations
on
the
infant
wonder
he
felt
that
the
baby
was
either
below
him
or
above
him
he
really
could
not
tell
which
of
his
wife
position
he
was
certain
she
was
far
higher
than
his
plane
of
existence
when
she
took
his
hand
it
was
from
the
heavens
from
larue
he
was
thoroughly
detached
and
with
a
joyful
sense
of
relief
freedom
betterment
they
talked
very
little
with
each
other
and
only
on
indifferent
subjects
and
in
the
presence
of
others
it
is
possible
that
this
separation
would
not
have
lasted
if
they
had
been
thrown
together
unguarded
as
had
been
the
case
on
board
the
creole
but
here
caring
for
his
infant
and
for
the
wife
who
had
suffered
so
much
and
so
sweetly
for
his
sake
the
colonel
felt
no
puissance
of
passionate
temptation
larue
had
no
conscience
no
sense
of
honor
but
like
many
cold
blooded
people
she
valued
herself
on
her
firmness
in
an
unwonted
burst
of
enthusiasm
she
had
told
him
that
all
must
be
over
between
them
and
she
meant
to
make
her
words
good
no
matter
what
he
might
desire
she
was
a
little
mortified
to
see
how
easily
he
had
cut
loose
from
her
but
she
knew
how
to
explain
it
so
as
not
to
wound
her
vanity
nor
tempt
her
to
break
her
resolution
if
he
did
not
love
his
wife
now
he
would
be
a
brute
she
reflected
and
if
he
had
had
the
possibilities
of
a
brute
in
him
i
never
should
have
had
a
caprice
for
him
after
all
i
do
not
care
much
for
the
merely
physical
human
being
par
le
c√¥te
morale
qu
de
moi
apr√®s
tout
je
suis
presque
aussi
pure
dans
les
sentiments
que
ma
petite
meanwhile
her
was
something
of
a
trial
to
her
at
times
she
thought
seriously
of
marrying
again
with
the
idea
of
putting
an
end
to
these
risky
intrigues
and
harassing
struggles
perhaps
it
was
under
this
impression
that
she
wrote
a
letter
to
colburne
informing
him
of
the
birth
of
ravvie
and
sketching
some
few
items
of
the
scene
with
a
picturesqueness
and
sympathy
that
quite
touched
the
young
gentleman
astonished
as
he
was
at
the
frankness
of
the
language
after
all
she
concluded
married
life
has
exquisite
pleasures
as
well
as
terrific
possibilities
of
sorrow
i
do
not
really
know
whether
to
advise
a
young
man
like
you
to
take
a
wife
or
not
whether
you
marry
or
remain
single
you
will
be
sorry
i
think
that
in
either
state
the
pains
outweigh
the
pleasures
it
follows
that
we
are
not
to
consider
our
own
happiness
but
to
do
what
we
think
is
for
the
happiness
of
others
is
not
this
the
true
secret
of
life
is
it
possible
that
i
have
been
unjust
queried
colburne
those
are
not
the
teachings
of
a
corrupted
nature
he
did
not
know
and
could
not
have
conceived
the
unnatural
conscience
the
abnormal
ideas
of
purity
and
duty
which
this
woman
had
created
for
her
own
use
and
comfort
out
of
elements
that
are
beyond
the
ken
of
most
new
englanders
he
was
the
child
of
puritanism
and
she
of
moral
philosophy
chapter
xxx
colonel
carter
commits
his
first
ungentlemanly
action
we
come
now
to
the
times
of
the
famous
and
unfortunate
red
river
expedition
during
the
winter
of
new
orleans
society
civil
as
well
as
military
was
wild
with
excitement
over
the
great
enterprise
which
was
not
only
to
crush
the
rebel
power
in
the
southwest
but
to
open
to
commerce
the
immense
stores
of
cotton
belonging
to
the
princely
planters
of
the
red
river
bottoms
cotton
was
gold
foreign
exchange
individual
wealth
national
solvency
thousands
of
men
went
half
mad
in
their
desire
for
cotton
cotton
was
a
contagion
an
influenza
a
delirium
in
the
height
of
this
excitement
a
corpulent
baldish
smiling
gentleman
of
fifty
was
closeted
not
for
the
first
time
with
the
chief
quartermaster
his
thick
feet
were
planted
wide
apart
his
chubby
hands
rested
on
his
chubby
knees
his
broad
base
completely
filled
the
large
office
chair
in
which
he
sat
his
paunchy
torso
and
fat
head
leaned
forward
in
an
attitude
of
eagerness
and
his
twinkling
grey
eyes
encircled
by
yellowish
folds
were
fixed
earnestly
upon
the
face
of
carter
colonel
you
make
a
great
mistake
in
letting
this
chance
slip
he
said
and
then
paused
to
wheeze
the
colonel
said
nothing
smoked
his
twenty
cent
havana
slowly
and
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
toes
of
his
twenty
dollar
boots
with
his
aristocratic
face
his
lazy
pride
of
expression
his
suit
his
boots
and
his
havana
he
looked
immensely
rich
and
superbly
indifferent
to
all
pecuniary
chances
you
see
here
is
a
sure
thing
continued
the
oleaginous
personage
banks
column
will
be
twenty
thousand
strong
steele
will
be
ten
thousand
there
are
thirty
thousand
without
counting
porter
fleet
the
confederates
ca
raise
twenty
thousand
to
cover
the
red

country
if
they
go
to
hell
besides
there
is
an
understanding
tit
for
tat
you
know
cotton
for
cash
you
see
i
am
as
well
posted
on
the
matter
as
you
are
colonel
here
he
paused
wheezed
nodded
smiled
and
bored
his
corkscrew
eyes
into
carter
the
latter
uttered
not
a
word
and
gave
no
sign
of
either
acquiescence
or
denial
you
see
the
cotton
is
sure
to
come
continued
the
stout
man
withdrawing
his
ocular
corkscrew
for
a
moment
now
what
i
propose
is
that
you
put
in
the
capital
or
the
greater
part
of
it
and
that
i
do
the
work
and
give
you
the
lion
share
of
the
profits
i
ca
furnish
the
capital
and
you
can
you
ca
do
the
work
and
i
can
or
suppose
i
guarantee
you
a
certain
sum
on
each
bale
colonel
for
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
promise
you
a
square
profit
of
two
hundred
thousand
walker
if
it
is
sure
to
pay
so
well
why
do
you
go
in
alone
asked
carter
walker
pointed
at
his
coarse
grey
trousers
and
then
took
hold
of
the
frayed
edge
of
his
coarse
grey
coat
see
here
colonel
said
he
the
man
who
wears
this
cloth
has
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
handy
when
i
knew
you
in
old
times
i
used
to
go
in
my
broadcloth
i
hope
to
do
it
again
not
that
i
care
for
it
that
one
reason
i
do
go
in
alone
a
short
bank
balance
another
is
that
i
have
the
influence
at
headquarters
that
you
have
i
need
your
name
as
well
as
your
money
to
put
the
business
through
quick
and
sure
that
why
i
offer
you
four
fifths
of
the
profits
colonel
it
a
certain
thing
and
a
good
thing
i
am
positively
astonished
at
finding
any
hesitation
in
a
man
in
your
pecuniary
condition
what
do
you
know
about
my
condition
demanded
carter
imperiously
well
it
my
interest
to
know
replied
walker
whose
cunning
fat
smile
did
not
quail
before
the
colonel
leonine
roar
and
toss
of
mane
i
have
bought
up
a
lot
of
your
debts
and
notes
i
got
them
for
an
average
of
sixty
colonel
you
paid
devilish
dear
and
made
a
bad
investment
said
carter
i
would
have
given
thirty
a
bitter
smile
twisted
his
lips
as
he
thought
how
poor
he
was
how
bad
his
credit
was
and
how
mean
it
was
to
be
poor
and
discredited
perhaps
i
have
i
believe
i
have
unless
you
go
into
this
cotton
i
bought
them
to
induce
you
to
go
into
it
i
thought
you
would
oblige
a
man
who
relieved
you
from
forty
or
fifty
duns
i
took
a
four
thousand
dollar
risk
on
you
colonel
carter
scowled
and
stopped
smoking
he
did
not
know
what
walker
could
do
with
him
he
did
not
much
believe
that
he
legally
could
do
anything
his
creditors
never
had
done
more
than
dun
him
but
high
authority
might
perhaps
be
led
to
do
unpleasant
things
for
instance
in
the
way
of
relieving
him
from
his
position
if
the
fact
should
be
forced
upon
its
notice
that
so
responsible
an
officer
as
the
chief
quartermaster
of
the
gulf
department
was
burdened
by
private
indebtedness
at
all
events
it
was
unpleasant
to
have
a
grasping
intriguing
audacious
fellow
like
walker
for
a
creditor
to
so
large
an
amount
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
get
out
of
debt
once
for
all
to
astonish
his
duns
impertinent
fellows
some
of
them
by
settling
every
solitary
bill
with
interest
to
be
rich
once
for
all
without
danger
of
recurring
poverty
to
be
rich
enough
to
force
promotion
other
officials
quartermasters
paymasters
were
going
in
for
cotton
on
the
strength
of
government
deposits
the
influenza
had
caught
the
colonel
indeed
it
was
enough
to
corrupt
any
man
honesty
to
breathe
the
moral
atmosphere
of
new
orleans
at
that
time
it
could
taint
the
honor
derived
from
blue
ancestral
blood
and
west
point
professional
pride
carter
did
not
however
give
way
to
his
oily
mephistopheles
during
this
interview
walker
victory
was
not
so
sudden
as
larue
his
temptation
was
not
so
well
suited
as
hers
to
the
character
of
the
victim
the
love
of
lucre
could
not
compare
as
a
force
with
divin
sens
du
it
was
not
until
walker
had
boldly
threatened
to
bring
his
claims
before
the
general
commanding
not
until
the
army
had
well
nigh
reached
the
red
river
not
until
the
chance
of
investment
had
almost
passed
that
the
colonel
became
a
speculator
once
resolved
he
acted
with
audacity
according
to
his
temperament
but
here
unfortunately
for
the
curious
reader
we
enter
upon
cavernous
darkness
where
it
is
impossible
to
trace
out
a
story
except
by
hazardous
inference
our
only
guides
being
common
rumor
a
fragment
of
a
letter
a
conversation
and
other
circumstances
of
a
like
unsatisfactory
nature
before
giving
my
narrative
publicity
i
feel
bound
to
state
that
the
entire
series
of
alleged
events
may
be
a
fiction
of
the
excited
popular
imagination
founded
on
facts
which
might
be
explained
in
accordance
with
an
assumption
of
carter
innocence
and
official
honor
i
am
inclined
to
believe
or
at
least
to
admit
that
he
drew
a
large
sum
not
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
the
government
money
in
his
charge
and
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
his
agent
for
the
purchase
of
cotton
from
the
planters
of
the
red
river
it
is
probable
that
walker
expected
to
complete
the
transaction
within
a
month
and
to
place
the
cotton
or
the
proceeds
of
it
in
the
hands
of
his
principal
early
enough
to
enable
the
latter
to
show
a
square
balance
on
his
official
return
at
the
close
of
the
current
quarter
such
claims
as
might
come
in
during
this
period
could
be
put
off
by
the
plea
of
no
funds
or
the
safer
devices
of
disallowed
papers
returned
for
correction
etc
that
the
cotton
could
be
sold
at
a
monstrous
profit
was
unquestionable
at
new
orleans
there
were
greedy
capitalists
who
had
not
been
lucky
enough
to
get
into
the
ring
and
so
accompany
the
expedition
who
were
anxious
to
pay
cash
down
for
the
precious
commodity
immediately
on
its
arrival
at
the
levee
or
even
before
it
quitted
the
red
river
no
body
entertained
a
doubt
of
the
military
and
commercial
success
of
the
great
expedition
with
its
fleet
its
veteran
infantry
its
abundant
cavalry
all
splendidly
equipped
and
its
strategic
combination
of
concentric
columns
even
rabid
secessionists
were
infected
by
the
mania
and
sought
to
invest
their
gold
in
cotton
it
is
probable
that
carter
hopes
at
this
time
were
far
higher
than
his
fears
and
that
he
pretty
confidently
expected
to
see
himself
a
rich
man
inside
of
sixty
days
i
am
telling
my
story
the
reader
perceives
on
the
presumption
that
rumor
has
correctly
stated
these
mysterious
events
if
the
materials
for
the
tale
were
only
attainable
it
would
be
a
delightful
thing
to
follow
the
corpulent
walker
through
the
peaceful
advance
and
sanguinary
retreat
of
the
great
expedition
it
is
certain
that
from
some
quarter
he
obtained
command
of
a
vast
capital
and
that
in
spite
of
his
avoirdupois
he
was
alert
and
indefatigable
in
seeking
opportunities
for
investment
had
mars
been
half
as
adroit
and
watchful
in
his
strategy
as
this
fat
old
mercury
was
in
his
speculations
shreveport
would
have
been
taken
and
carter
would
have
made
a
quarter
of
a
million
but
the
god
of
lucre
had
great
reason
to
grumble
at
the
god
of
war
it
was
in
vain
that
mercury
lost
fifty
pounds
of
flesh
in
sleepless
lookout
for
chances
in
audacious
rides
to
plantations
haunted
by
guerrillas
shot
at
from
swamps
and
thickets
half
starved
or
living
on
raw
pork
and
hardtack
bargaining
nearly
all
night
after
riding
all
day
untiring
as
a
savage
zealous
as
an
abolitionist
sublime
in
his
passion
for
gain
mars
incautiously
stretched
his
splendid
army
over
thirty
miles
of
road
and
saw
it
beaten
in
detachments
by
a
force
one
quarter
smaller
and
vastly
inferior
in
discipline
and
equipment
there
was
such
a
panic
at
sabine
cross
roads
as
had
not
been
seen
since
bull
run
cavalry
artillery
and
infantry
mingled
together
in
hopeless
confusion
rushed
in
wild
flight
across
the
open
fields
or
forced
their
way
down
a
narrow
road
encumbered
with
miles
of
abandoned
baggage
wagons
through
this
chaos
of
terror
advanced
the
saviours
of
the
day
the
heroic
first
division
of
the
nineteenth
corps
marching
calmly
by
the
flank
hooting
and
jeering
the
runaways
filing
into
line
within
grape
range
of
the
enemy
and
opening
a
withering
fire
of
musketry
which
checked
until
nightfall
the
victorious
elated
impetuous
rebel
masses
then
came
an
extraordinary
midnight
retreat
of
twenty
miles
and
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
a
unimproved
victory
the
first
division
of
the
nineteenth
corps
and
seven
thousand
men
of
the
sixteenth
corps
the
one
forming
the
right
and
the
other
the
left
resisted
for
hours
the
violent
charges
of
the
rebels
and
then
advanced
two
miles
occupying
the
field
of
battle
the
soldiers
were
victorious
but
the
general
was
beaten
a
new
retreat
was
ordered
and
mercury
went
totally
to
grief
the
obese
walker
was
last
seen
by
loyal
eyes
on
the
night
which
followed
the
barren
triumph
of
pleasant
hill
he
had
had
his
horse
shot
under
him
in
the
beginning
of
the
fighting
at
sabine
cross
roads
while
in
advance
of
the
column
had
effected
a
masterly
retreat
partly
on
foot
and
partly
on
a
government
mule
which
he
took
from
a
negro
driver
who
had
cut
it
loose
from
an
entangled
wagon
had
fed
himself
abundantly
from
the
havresacks
of
defunct
rebels
on
the
field
of
victory
and
then
had
heroically
set
to
work
to
make
the
best
of
circumstances
believing
with
the
confidence
of
his
sanguine
nature
that
the
army
would
advance
in
the
morning
he
started
on
his
mule
accompanied
by
two
comrades
of
the
ring
for
the
house
of
a
neighboring
planter
to
whom
it
is
supposed
that
he
had
advanced
cash
for
cotton
no
one
knows
to
this
day
what
became
of
him
or
of
his
funds
or
investments
or
fellow
adventurers
all
alike
disappeared
utterly
and
forever
from
the
knowledge
of
the
union
army
when
the
three
rode
into
that
night
of
blood
and
groans
beyond
the
flickering
circle
of
light
thrown
out
by
the
camp
fires
the
news
of
the
calamity
we
may
suppose
nearly
paralyzed
carter
defalcation
trial
by
disgraceful
dismissal
from
the
service
hard
labor
at
tortugas
ball
and
chain
a
beggared
family
a
crazed
wife
must
have
made
up
a
terrific
spectre
advancing
close
at
hand
unavoidable
pitiless
it
would
be
a
laborious
task
to
analyze
and
fully
conceive
the
feelings
of
such
a
man
in
such
a
position
naturally
and
with
inexorable
logic
followed
the
second
act
of
the
moral
tragedy
a
deed
which
some
men
would
call
merely
a
blunder
led
straight
to
another
deed
which
all
men
would
call
a
crime
he
could
not
as
men
have
sometimes
done
hope
to
annul
his
indebtedness
by
the
simple
commission
of
murder
irresistible
necessity
drove
him
if
our
hypothetical
tale
is
correct
into
a
species
of
wickedness
which
was
probably
more
repugnant
to
his
peculiarly
educated
conscience
than
the
taking
of
human
life
carter
wanted
we
will
say
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
dollars
to
make
himself
square
with
the
united
states
and
his
private
creditors
looking
over
the
government
property
for
which
he
had
receipted
and
was
responsible
he
found
fifteen
steamboats
formerly
freight
or
passenger
boats
on
the
mississippi
and
its
branches
but
now
regular
transports
part
of
them
lying
idly
at
the
levee
the
others
engaged
in
carrying
reinforcements
to
the
army
at
grande
ecore
or
in
bringing
back
the
sick
and
wounded
if
ten
of
these
boats
were
sold
at
an
average
of
ten
thousand
dollars
apiece
and
at
an
average
of
thousand
dollars
apiece
the
transaction
would
furnish
a
profit
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
which
would
settle
all
his
debts
besides
furnishing
first
he
wanted
a
nominal
purchaser
who
had
that
sort
of
honor
which
is
necessary
among
thieves
fortune
enough
to
render
the
story
of
the
purchase
plausible
and
character
enough
to
impose
on
the
public
carter
went
straight
to
a
man
of
known
fortune
born
in
new
orleans
high
in
social
position
a
secessionist
who
had
taken
the
oath
of
allegiance
hollister
was
a
small
and
thin
gentleman
with
sallow
and
hollow
cheeks
black
eyes
iron
gray
hair
mellow
voice
composed
and
elegant
manners
his
air
notwithstanding
his
small
size
was
remarkably
dignified
and
his
expression
was
so
calm
that
it
would
have
seemed
benignant
but
for
a
most
unhappy
eye
it
was
startlingly
black
with
an
agitated
flicker
in
it
like
the
flame
of
a
candle
blowing
in
the
wind
it
did
not
seem
to
be
pursuing
any
object
without
but
rather
flying
from
some
horrible
thought
within
what
intrigue
or
crime
or
suffering
it
was
the
record
of
it
is
not
worth
while
to
inquire
there
had
been
many
dark
things
done
or
planned
in
louisiana
during
the
lifetime
of
hollister
his
age
must
have
been
although
the
freshness
of
his
brown
morning
suit
the
fineness
and
fit
of
his
linen
the
neat
brush
to
his
hair
the
clean
shave
on
his
face
took
ten
years
off
his
shoulders
as
he
dabbled
in
stocks
and
speculations
he
had
his
office
he
advanced
to
meet
the
chief
quartermaster
shook
hands
with
respectful
cordiality
and
conducted
him
to
a
chair
with
as
much
politeness
as
if
he
were
a
lady
you
look
pale
colonel
he
said
allow
me
to
offer
you
a
glass
of
brandy
trying
season
this
last
summer
there
was
a
time
when
i
never
thought
of
facing
our
climate
all
the
year
round
taking
out
of
a
cupboard
one
of
the
many
bottles
of
choice
old
cognac
with
which
he
had
enriched
his
before
the
million
of
former
days
had
dwindled
to
the
hundred
thousand
of
he
set
it
beside
a
pitcher
of
and
some
glasses
which
stood
on
a
table
the
colonel
swallowed
half
a
tumbler
of
pure
brandy
and
dashed
some
water
after
it
the
broker
mixed
a
weak
sling
and
sipped
it
to
keep
his
visitor
in
countenance
hollister
said
carter
i
hope
i
shall
not
offend
you
if
i
say
that
i
know
you
have
suffered
heavily
by
the
war
i
shall
certainly
not
be
offended
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
showing
the
slightest
interest
in
my
affairs
you
have
taken
the
oath
of
allegiance
have
you
hollister
said
yes
and
bowed
respectfully
as
if
saluting
the
united
states
government
it
is
only
fair
that
you
should
obtain
remuneration
for
your
losses
the
black
eyes
flashed
a
little
under
the
bushy
eyebrows
but
the
sallow
face
showed
no
other
sign
of
interest
and
none
of
impatience
i
know
of
a
transaction
an
investment
pursued
carter
which
will
probably
enable
you
to
pocket
to
realize
perhaps
twenty
thousand
dollars
i
should
be
indebted
to
you
for
life
whatever
service
i
can
render
in
return
will
be
given
with
all
my
heart
it
requires
secrecy
may
i
ask
you
to
pledge
your
word
i
pledge
it
colonel
my
word
of
honor
as
a
louisiana
gentleman
carter
drew
a
long
breath
poured
out
another
dose
of
brandy
partially
raised
it
and
then
set
it
down
without
drinking
there
are
ten
river
steamboats
here
he
went
on
ten
transports
which
are
not
wanted
i
have
received
a
message
from
headquarters
to
the
effect
that
we
no
longer
need
our
present
large
force
of
transports
the
army
will
not
retreat
from
grande
ecore
it
is
sufficiently
reinforced
to
go
to
shreveport
i
am
empowered
to
select
eight
of
these
transports
for
sale
you
understand
precisely
bowed
hollister
if
the
army
advances
of
course
it
does
not
need
transports
as
to
the
military
information
he
neither
believed
nor
disbelieved
knowing
well
that
the
colonel
would
not
honestly
tell
him
anything
of
consequence
on
that
score
well
they
will
be
sold
added
carter
after
a
pause
during
which
he
vainly
tried
to
imagine
some
other
method
of
covering
his
enormous
defalcation
they
will
be
sold
at
auction
they
will
probably
bring
next
to
nothing
i
propose
that
you
be
present
to
buy
them
the
broker
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
or
two
and
when
he
had
opened
them
he
had
made
his
calculations
he
inferred
that
the
united
states
government
was
not
to
profit
much
by
the
transaction
that
in
plain
words
it
was
to
be
cheated
out
of
an
amount
of
property
more
or
less
considerable
and
being
a
confederate
at
heart
he
had
no
objection
why
not
have
a
private
sale
he
asked
it
is
contrary
to
the
regulations
ah
then
it
might
be
well
not
to
have
the
auction
made
too
public
i
suppose
so
perhaps
that
can
be
arranged
i
can
arrange
it
colonel
if
i
may
select
the
parties
to
be
present
men
of
straw
you
understand
the
auction
will
wear
a
sufficient
air
of
publicity
and
will
yet
be
substantially
a
private
sale
all
that
is
easily
enough
managed
provided
we
first
understand
each
other
thoroughly
listen
if
you
please
the
ten
steamboats
are
worth
we
will
say
an
average
of
thousand
dollars
or
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
for
the
lot
if
i
buy
them
for
an
average
of
ten
thousand
which
is
respectable
here
he
looked
gravely
at
carter
and
seeing
assent
in
his
eyes
continued
if
i
buy
them
at
an
average
of
ten
thousand
there
will
remain
a
profit
in
case
of
sale
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
that
is
very
well
exceedingly
well
of
course
i
should
only
demand
a
moderate
proportion
of
so
large
a
sum
but
there
are
several
other
things
to
be
considered
if
i
am
to
pay
cash
down
it
will
oblige
me
to
borrow
immensely
and
perhaps
to
realize
at
a
loss
by
forcing
sales
of
my
stocks
in
that
case
i
should
want
say
a
third
of
the
profit
in
order
to
cover
my
risk
and
my
losses
as
well
as
my
expenses
in
the
way
of
to
be
plain
if
i
can
pay
by
giving
my
notes
and
moreover
can
be
made
sure
of
a
purchaser
before
the
notes
mature
i
can
afford
to
undertake
the
job
for
one
sixth
of
the
profits
which
i
estimate
to
be
thousand
dollars
there
was
a
flash
of
pleasure
in
carter
eyes
at
discovering
that
the
broker
was
so
moderate
in
his
expectations
there
was
a
similar
glitter
in
the
dark
orbs
of
hollister
at
seeing
that
the
colonel
tacitly
accepted
his
offer
from
which
he
would
have
been
willing
to
abate
a
few
thousands
rather
than
lose
the
job
the
boats
will
have
to
go
before
an
inspector
before
they
can
be
sold
said
the
colonel
after
a
few
moments
of
reverie
during
which
he
drank
off
his
brandy
i
hope
he
will
be
amenable
to
reason
said
hollister
perhaps
he
will
need
a
couple
of
thousands
or
so
before
he
will
be
able
to
discover
his
line
of
duty
it
may
answer
if
he
is
merely
ignorant
of
steamboats
of
course
he
is
what
can
an
army
officer
know
about
steam
engines
or
hulls
i
will
see
that
he
is
posted
i
will
see
that
he
has
entirely
satisfactory
evidence
concerning
the
worthless
nature
of
the
property
from
the
captains
and
engineers
and
carpenters
that
will
require
say
three
thousand
possibly
twice
that
i
will
advance
the
money
for
these
incidental
expenses
and
you
will
reimburse
me
one
half
when
the
transaction
is
complete
the
colonel
looked
up
uneasily
and
made
no
reply
he
did
not
want
to
make
money
out
of
the
swindle
curiously
enough
he
still
had
too
much
conscience
too
much
honor
for
that
but
he
must
be
sure
of
enough
to
clear
off
his
defalcation
well
we
will
see
about
that
afterward
compromised
hollister
i
will
pay
these
expenses
and
leave
the
question
of
reimbursement
to
you
by
the
way
what
are
the
names
of
the
boats
i
know
some
of
them
queen
of
the
south
queen
of
the
west
pelican
crescent
city
palmetto
union
father
of
waters
red
river
gulf
state
and
massachusetts
repeated
carter
with
a
pause
of
recollection
before
each
title
the
broker
laughed
i
used
to
own
three
of
them
i
know
them
all
except
the
massachusetts
which
is
a
northern
boat
all
in
running
order
yes
dirty
of
course
very
well
now
permit
me
to
make
out
a
complete
programme
of
the
transaction
the
boats
are
recommended
for
the
action
of
an
inspector
i
see
to
it
that
he
receives
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
their
unserviceable
condition
it
is
ordered
that
they
be
sold
at
public
auction
i
provide
the
persons
who
are
to
be
present
at
the
auction
these
men
my
agents
will
purchase
the
boats
at
a
net
cost
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
which
they
will
give
my
notes
payable
a
month
from
date
within
the
month
i
am
supposed
to
refit
the
boats
and
make
them
serviceable
while
the
government
is
certain
to
need
them
back
again
i
then
sell
them
to
you
the
purchasing
agent
of
the
government
for
a
net
sum
of
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
i
receive
my
notes
back
and
also
a
cash
balance
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
dollars
of
which
i
only
take
thirty
thousand
leaving
the
rest
in
your
hands
under
a
mutual
pledge
of
confidence
i
desire
to
make
one
final
suggestion
which
i
consider
of
great
importance
it
would
be
well
if
the
boats
when
should
accidentally
take
fire
and
be
destroyed
as
it
would
prevent
inspection
as
to
the
amount
which
i
might
have
expended
in
repairs
colonel
is
that
perfectly
to
your
satisfaction
the
unfortunate
unhappy
degraded
officer
and
gentleman
could
only
reply
yes
such
is
the
supposed
secret
history
of
this
scandalous
stroke
of
business
it
is
only
certain
that
the
boats
were
inspected
and
condemned
that
at
an
auction
attended
by
a
limited
number
of
respectably
dressed
persons
they
were
sold
for
sums
varying
from
seven
to
fifteen
thousand
dollars
that
the
amounts
were
all
paid
in
the
notes
of
hollister
a
broker
and
capitalist
of
supposed
secession
proclivities
that
within
a
month
the
transports
were
repurchased
by
the
government
at
sums
varying
from
fifteen
to
thirty
thousand
dollars
that
thus
a
net
profit
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
accrued
to
the
said
hollister
and
that
three
days
after
the
sale
the
boats
caught
fire
and
burned
to
the
water
edge
of
course
there
was
talk
perhaps
unjustifiable
suspicions
which
perhaps
had
no
foundation
in
fact
but
there
was
no
investigation
possibly
no
serious
cause
for
it
probably
no
chance
for
it
colonel
carter
sent
a
square
to
the
department
at
washington
and
paid
all
his
private
debts
in
new
orleans
but
he
grew
thin
looked
anxious
or
ostentatiously
gay
and
resumed
to
some
extent
his
habits
of
drinking
once
he
terrified
his
wife
by
remaining
out
all
night
explaining
when
he
came
home
in
the
morning
that
he
had
been
up
the
river
on
pressing
business
the
truth
is
that
the
colonel
had
got
himself
drunk
and
had
slept
himself
sober
in
a
hotel
chapter
xxxi
a
torture
which
might
have
been
spared
a
week
after
the
conflagration
carter
received
his
commission
as
his
first
impression
was
one
of
exultation
his
enemies
and
his
adverse
fate
had
been
beaten
he
was
on
the
road
to
distinction
he
could
wear
the
silver
star
then
came
a
feeling
of
despondency
and
fear
while
he
remembered
the
crime
into
which
he
had
been
driven
as
he
thought
or
tried
to
think
by
the
lack
of
this
just
recognition
of
his
services
oh
the
bitterness
of
good
fortune
long
desired
which
comes
too
late
a
month
ago
this
might
have
saved
me
he
muttered
and
then
burst
into
curses
upon
his
political
opponents
his
creditors
himself
all
those
who
had
brought
about
his
ruin
my
only
crime
the
only
ungentlemanly
act
of
my
life
was
another
phrase
which
dropped
from
his
lips
doubtless
he
thought
so
many
people
of
high
social
position
hold
a
similarly
mixed
moral
creed
they
allow
that
a
gentleman
may
be
given
to
expensive
immoralities
but
not
to
ones
that
he
may
indulge
in
wine
women
and
play
but
not
in
swindling
all
over
europe
this
curious
ethical
distinction
prevails
and
very
naturally
for
it
springs
out
of
the
conditions
of
a
hereditary
aristocracy
and
makes
allowance
for
the
vices
to
which
wealthy
nobles
are
tempted
but
not
for
vices
to
which
they
are
not
tempted
a
feeble
echo
of
it
has
traversed
the
ocean
and
influenced
some
characters
in
america
both
for
good
and
for
evil
carter
was
almost
astonished
at
the
joy
so
contradictory
to
his
own
angry
remorse
with
which
lillie
received
the
news
of
his
promotion
oh
my
general
she
said
coloring
to
her
forehead
with
delight
after
a
single
glance
at
the
commission
which
he
dropped
into
her
lap
she
rose
up
and
gave
him
a
mock
military
salute
then
sprang
at
him
and
covered
his
bronzed
face
and
long
mustache
with
kisses
i
am
so
happy
they
have
done
you
justice
at
last
a
little
justice
oh
i
am
so
glad
and
proud
i
am
going
with
you
to
buy
the
star
you
shall
let
me
choose
it
then
her
mind
taking
a
forward
leap
of
fifteen
years
she
added
we
will
send
ravvie
to
west
point
and
he
shall
be
a
general
too
he
is
going
to
be
very
intelligent
and
brave
also
he
is
in
the
least
timid
carter
laughed
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
received
the
commission
my
dear
said
he
ravvie
will
probably
become
a
general
long
after
i
have
ceased
to
be
one
i
am
a
volunteer
i
am
only
a
general
while
the
war
lasts
but
the
war
will
last
a
long
time
hopefully
replied
the
monster
in
woman
guise
who
loved
her
husband
a
hundred
times
as
much
as
she
did
her
country
there
is
one
unpleasant
result
of
this
promotion
observed
carter
what
you
are
not
going
to
the
field
asked
lillie
clutching
him
by
the
sleeve
oh
do
do
that
my
little
girl
i
can
not
hold
my
present
position
a
ca
remain
quartermaster
not
even
of
a
department
i
must
resign
it
and
report
for
duty
headquarters
may
order
me
to
the
field
and
i
certainly
ought
to
go
oh
no
it
ca
be
necessary
to
think
that
this
should
come
just
when
we
were
so
happy
i
wish
you
had
been
promoted
my
darling
you
want
to
make
a
woman
of
me
he
said
holding
her
close
to
his
side
i
must
show
myself
a
man
now
that
my
manhood
has
been
recognized
my
honor
demands
it
he
talked
of
his
honor
from
long
habit
conscious
however
that
the
word
stung
him
but
do
ask
to
be
sent
to
the
field
pleaded
lillie
resign
your
place
and
report
for
duty
if
you
must
but
please
do
ask
to
be
sent
to
the
field
promise
me
that
wo
you
looking
into
his
wife
tearful
eyes
with
his
strong
and
plump
hands
on
her
sloping
shoulders
the
colonel
promised
as
she
asked
him
but
that
evening
writing
from
his
office
he
sent
a
communication
to
the
headquarters
of
the
department
of
the
gulf
requesting
that
he
might
be
relieved
from
his
quartermastership
and
assigned
to
duty
with
the
army
in
the
field
what
else
should
he
do
he
had
proved
himself
unfit
for
family
life
unfit
for
business
but
by
this
and
that
and
the
other
he
could
command
a
brigade
and
he
could
fight
he
would
do
what
he
had
done
and
could
do
again
with
credit
besides
if
he
should
win
distinction
at
grande
ecore
it
might
prevent
an
investigation
into
that
infernal
muddle
of
cotton
and
steamboats
a
great
deal
is
pardoned
by
the
public
and
even
by
the
war
department
to
courage
capacity
and
success
in
a
few
days
he
received
orders
from
the
general
commanding
directing
him
to
report
to
the
headquarters
of
the
army
in
the
field
he
signed
his
last
quartermaster
papers
gaily
kissed
his
wife
and
child
sadly
shook
hands
with
ravenel
and
larue
and
took
the
first
boat
up
the
river
lillie
was
amazed
and
shocked
at
discovering
how
little
she
missed
him
she
accused
herself
of
being
wicked
and
heartless
she
would
not
accept
the
explanation
that
she
was
a
mother
it
was
all
the
more
hateful
in
her
to
forget
him
she
said
now
that
he
was
the
father
of
her
child
still
she
could
not
be
miserable
she
was
almost
always
happy
with
her
baby
such
a
lovely
baby
he
was
charming
because
he
was
heavy
because
he
ate
because
he
slept
because
he
cried
his
wailing
troubled
her
because
it
denoted
that
he
was
ill
at
ease
and
not
because
the
sound
was
in
itself
disagreeable
to
her
ear
if
she
heard
it
at
a
little
distance
from
the
house
for
instance
when
returning
from
a
walk
she
quickened
her
step
and
smiled
gaily
saying
he
is
alive
you
will
see
how
he
will
stop
when
i
take
him
people
who
feel
so
strongly
are
rarely
interesting
except
to
those
who
share
their
feelings
or
who
have
learned
to
love
them
under
any
circumstances
and
through
all
the
metamorphoses
of
which
a
single
character
is
capable
she
would
have
been
perfectly
tedious
at
this
period
to
any
ordinary
acquaintance
who
had
not
been
initiated
into
the
sweet
mystery
of
love
for
children
her
character
and
conversation
seemed
to
be
all
solved
in
the
great
alembic
of
maternity
she
was
a
mother
as
passionately
as
she
had
been
a
betrothed
and
a
wife
and
indeed
it
appeared
as
if
this
culminating
condition
of
her
womanhood
was
the
most
absorbing
of
all
this
exquisite
life
delicious
in
spite
of
her
occasional
anxieties
and
concerning
her
husband
flowed
on
without
much
mixture
of
trouble
until
one
day
she
picked
up
a
letter
on
the
floor
of
her
father
study
which
opened
to
her
a
hitherto
inconceivable
fountain
of
bitterness
let
us
see
how
this
unfortunate
manuscript
found
its
way
into
the
house
doctor
ravenel
deprived
for
the
last
two
years
of
his
accustomed
summer
trip
to
europe
or
the
north
or
other
countries
blessed
with
a
mineralogy
sought
health
and
amusement
in
long
walks
about
new
orleans
and
its
flat
ugly
vicinity
lillie
who
used
to
be
his
comrade
in
these
exercises
now
took
constitutionals
in
the
pony
carriage
or
in
company
with
the
wicker
wagon
of
master
ravvie
these
strolls
of
the
doctor
were
therefore
somewhat
dull
business
a
country
destitute
of
stones
was
to
him
much
like
a
language
destitute
of
a
literature
he
fell
into
a
way
of
walking
without
paying
much
attention
to
his
surroundings
revolving
the
while
new
systems
of
mineralogy
crystallizing
his
knowledge
into
novel
classifications
recalling
to
memory
the
characteristics
of
his
specimens
as
lillie
recollected
the
giggles
and
cunning
ways
of
her
baby
in
one
of
these
moods
he
was
surprised
by
a
heavy
shower
three
or
four
miles
from
home
the
only
shelter
was
a
deserted
shanty
once
probably
the
dwelling
of
a
free
negro
a
minute
or
two
after
the
doctor
found
himself
in
its
single
room
and
before
he
had
discovered
the
soundest
part
of
its
leaky
roof
a
man
in
the
undress
uniform
of
a
united
states
officer
dripping
wet
reeled
into
the
doorway
with
the
observation
by
jove
this
is
watering
my
rum
the
doctor
immediately
recognized
in
the
herculean
form
bronzed
face
black
eyes
and
twisted
nose
the
personality
of
lieutenant
van
zandt
he
had
not
seen
him
for
nearly
two
years
but
the
man
appearance
and
voice
were
unforgettable
the
doctor
was
charitable
in
philosophising
concerning
coarse
and
vicious
people
but
he
abominated
their
society
and
always
avoided
it
if
possible
he
looked
about
him
for
a
means
of
escape
and
found
none
the
man
filled
up
the
only
and
the
rain
was
descending
in
torrents
accordingly
the
doctor
turned
his
back
on
the
lieutenant
and
ruminated
mineralogy
i
prefer
plain
whisky
continued
van
zandt
staring
at
the
rain
with
a
contemptuous
grin
i
do
want
by
jove
so
much
water
in
my
grog
none
of
your
mixed
drinks
by
jove
plain
whisky
after
a
minute
more
of
glaring
and
smiling
he
remarked
dam
slow
business
by
jove
van
zandt
my
bully
boy
we
wo
wait
to
see
this
thing
out
we
turn
in
facing
about
with
a
lurch
he
beheld
the
other
inmate
of
the
shanty
hullo
he
exclaimed
then
recollecting
the
breeding
of
his
youth
he
added
i
beg
pardon
sir
am
i
intruding
not
at
all
of
course
not
replied
ravenel
our
rights
here
are
the
same
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
and
by
the
way
have
the
kindness
to
understand
me
sir
i
did
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
supposed
this
to
be
your
residence
i
only
thought
that
you
might
be
the
proprietor
of
the
estate
not
so
unfortunate
said
the
doctor
the
lieutenant
laughed
like
a
brass
howitzer
the
noisiest
gun
i
believe
in
existence
very
good
sir
the
more
a
man
owns
here
in
louisiana
the
poorer
he
is
that
just
my
opinion
sir
i
feel
honored
in
agreeing
with
you
sir
by
jove
i
own
nothing
i
could
afford
it
on
my
pay
a
stream
of
water
from
a
hole
in
the
roof
was
pattering
on
his
broad
back
but
he
took
no
notice
of
it
and
probably
was
not
conscious
of
it
he
stared
at
the
doctor
with
unblinking
bulging
eyes
not
in
the
least
recollecting
him
but
perfectly
conscious
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
gentleman
drunk
or
sober
van
zandt
never
forgot
that
he
came
of
old
knickerbocker
stock
and
never
failed
to
accord
respect
to
aristocratic
demeanor
wherever
he
found
it
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
resumed
you
must
excuse
me
for
addressing
you
in
this
free
and
easy
way
i
only
saw
you
indistinctly
at
first
sir
and
could
judge
as
to
your
social
position
and
individual
character
i
perceive
that
you
are
a
gentleman
sir
you
will
excuse
me
for
mentioning
that
i
come
of
an
old
knickerbocker
family
which
dates
in
american
history
from
the
good
old
jolly
dutch
times
of
peter
stuyvesant
god
bless
his
jolly
old
dutch
memory
you
will
understand
sir
that
a
man
who
feels
such
blood
as
that
in
his
veins
is
glad
to
meet
a
gentleman
anywhere
even
in
such
a
cursed
old
hovel
as
this
as
leaky
and
rickety
by
jove
as
the
southern
confederacy
and
sir
in
that
connection
allow
me
to
say
hoping
no
offence
if
you
hold
a
contrary
opinion
that
the
confederacy
is
played
out
we
licked
them
on
the
red
river
sir
the
bully
old
first
division
god
bless
its
ragged
old
flags
i
ca
speak
of
them
without
feeling
my
eyes
water
much
as
i
hate
the
fluid
the
jolly
fighting
old
first
division
fairly
murdered
them
at
sabine
cross
roads
at
pleasant

the
old

andrew

smith
western
boys
laid
them
out
over
two
miles
square
of

if
we
had
had
a
cracker
in
our
haversacks
we
would
have
gone
bang
up
to
shreveport
if
we
had
had
a
cracker
apiece
and
the
firm
of
do
you
know
what
i
mean
sir
by
c
weitzel
and
carter
those
are
the
boys
for
an
advance
that
the
firm
that
our
brigade
and
division
banks
on
weitzel
and
carter
would
have
taken
us
to
shreveport
with
or
without
crackers
by
jove
we
wanted
nothing
but
energy
if
we
had
had
half
the
go
the
vim
the
forward
march
to
lead
us
that
the
rebels
had
we
would
have
finished
the
war
in
the
southwest
we
must
take
a
leaf
out
of
johnny
reb
book
est
ab
hostes
i
believe
i
quote
correctly
if
not
please
correct
me
by
the
way
did
i
mention
to
you
that
i
am
a
graduate
of
columbia
college
in
new
york
city
allow
me
to
repeat
the
statement
i
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
the
fact
inasmuch
as
i
took
the
greek
salutatory
the
second
highest
honor
sir
of
the
graduation
you
are
a
college
man
yourself
sir
i
perceive
and
can
make
allowance
for
my
vanity
in
the
circumstance
but
i
am
wandering
from
my
subject
i
was
speaking
i
believe
of
colonel
carter
i
beg
his
pardon
general
carter
at
last
sir
the
administration
has
done
justice
to
one
of
the
most
gallant
and
capable
officers
in
the
service
so
much
the
better
for
the
administration
colonel
carter
i
beg
pardon
general
carter
is
not
only
an
officer
but
a
gentleman
not
one
of
those
plebeian
humbugs
whom
our
ridiculous
democracy
delights
to
call
nature
gentlemen
but
a
gentleman
born
and
bred

who

as
i
believe
i
had
the
honor
to
inform
you
i
delight
to
see
such
men
put
forward
do
you
sir
the
doctor
admitted
with
a
polite
smile
that
the
promotion
of
general
carter
gave
him
pleasure
i
knew
it
would
sir
you
came
of
good
blood
yourself
i
can
see
it
in
your
manners
and
conversation
sir
well
as
i
was
saying
the
promotion
of
carter
is
one
of
the
most
intelligent
moves
of
the
administration
carter
i
beg
pardon
i
do
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
am
on
familiar
terms
with
him
i
acknowledge
him
as
my
superior
officer
and
keep
my
distance
general
carter
is
born
for
command
and
for
victory
wherever
he
goes
he
conquers
he
is
triumphant
in
the
field
and
in
the
boudoir
he
is
victorious
over
man
and
women
by
jove
sir
here
he
gave
a
saturnine
chuckle
and
leer
i
came
across
the
most
amusing
proof
of
his
capacity
for
bringing
the
fair
sex
to
a
surrender
the
doctor
grew
uneasy
and
looked
out
anxiously
at
the
pouring
rain
but
saw
no
chance
of
effecting
an
escape
you
see
sir
i
am
wounded
continued
van
zandt
they
gave
me
a
welt
at
port

and
they
gave
me
another
at
pleasant
hill
my
dear
sir
you
will
catch
your
death
standing
under
the
dripping
in
that
way
said
the
doctor
thank
you
sir
replied
van
zandt
changing
his
position
no
great
harm
however
water
sir
does
hurt
me
unless
it
gets
into
my
whiskey
exteriorly
it
is
simply
disagreeable
interiorly
the
same
as
well
as
injurious
not
that
i
am
opposed
to
bathing
on
the
contrary
it
is
my
practice
to
take
a
sponge
bath
every
morning
that
is
when
i
do
sleep
within
musket
range
of
the
enemy
well
as
i
was
saying
they
gave
me
a
welt
at
pleasant
hill
a
mere
flesh
wound
through
the
thigh
nothing
worth
blathering
about
and
i
was
sent
to
james
hospital
i
ca
stand
the
hospital
i
do
fancy
the
fare
at
the
table
sir
this
with
a
grimace
of
unutterable
disgust
i
took
out
a
leave
of
absence
and
went
over
to
the
lake
house
lost
my
horse
there
and
had
to
foot
it
back
to
the
city
that
is
how
i
came
to
have
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
your
conversation
here
sir
but
i
believe
i
was
speaking
of
general
carter
some
miserable
light
wine
which
i
had
the
folly
to
drink
at
the
lake
has
muddled
my
head
i
fancy
plain
whisky
is
the
only
safe
thing
allow
me
to
recommend
you
to
stick
to
it
i
wish
we
had
a
canteen
of
honest
commissary
now
we
could
pass
the
night
very
comfortably
sir
but
i
was
speaking
of
general
carter
and
his
qualities
as
an
officer
ah
i
remember
i
mentioned
a
letter
and
by
jove
here
it
is
in
my
soaked
with
this
cursed
water
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
peruse
it
you
will
see
that
i
am
not
exaggerating
when
i
boast
of
the
conquests
of
my
superior
officer
the
lady
frankly
owns
up
to
the
fact
that
she
has
surrendered
to
him
no
capitulation
no
terms
no
honors
of
war
unconditional
surrender
by
jove
a
surrender
it
is
an
unreserved
coming
down
of
the
coon
it
is
one
of
lillie
letters
thought
ravenel
this
drunkard
does
not
know
that
the
general
is
married
and
mistakes
the
frank
affection
of
a
wife
for
the
illicit
passion
of
an
it
is
best
that
i
should
expose
the
mistake
and
prevent
further
misrepresentation
he
took
the
moist
blurred
sheet
unfolded
it
and
found
the
envelope
carefully
doubled
up
inside
it
was
addressed
to
colonel
carter
with
the
addition
in
one
corner
of
the
word
personal
the
handwriting
was
not
lillie
but
a
large
round
hand
foreign
in
style
and
as
he
judged
feigned
glancing
at
the
chirography
of
the
note
itself
he
immediately
recognized
as
he
thought
the
small
close
neat
penmanship
of
larue
van
zandt
was
too
drunk
to
notice
how
pale
the
doctor
turned
and
how
his
hand
trembled
by
jove
i
am
tired
said
the
bacchanal
i
shall
with
your
permission
take
the
d
st
nap
that
ever
was
heard
of
since
the
days
of
the
seven
sleepers
do
be
alarmed
sir
at
my
snoring
i
go
off
like
a
steamboat
bursting
its
boiler
tearing
a
couple
of
boards
from
the
wall
of
the
shanty
he
laid
them
side
by
side
in
one
corner
selected
a
blackened
stone
from
the
for
a
pillow
put
his
cap
on
it
stretched
himself
out
with
an
inebriated
smile
and
was
fast
asleep
before
the
doctor
had
decided
whether
he
would
or
would
not
read
the
letter
he
was
most
anxious
to
establish
innocence
if
there
was
any
guilt
he
did
not
want
to
know
it
he
ran
over
all
of
larue
conduct
since
the
marriage
and
could
not
call
to
mind
a
single
circumstance
which
had
excited
in
him
a
suspicion
of
evil
she
was
coquettish
and
he
feared
unprincipled
but
he
could
not
believe
that
she
was
desperately
wicked
nevertheless
as
he
did
not
understand
the
woman
as
he
erroneously
supposed
her
to
be
of
an
ardent
impulsive
nature
he
thought
it
possible
that
she
had
been
fascinated
by
the
presence
of
such
a
masculine
being
as
carter
of
him
as
yet
he
had
no
suspicion
no
he
could
not
have
been
false
even
in
thought
to
his
young
wife
or
as
ravenel
phrased
it
to
himself
to
my
daughter
he
would
read
the
letter
and
probe
the
ugly
mystery
and
discover
the
falsity
of
its
terrors
as
he
unfolded
the
paper
he
was
checked
by
the
thought
that
to
peruse
unbidden
a
lady
correspondence
was
hardly
honorable
but
there
was
a
reply
to
that
the
mischief
of
publicity
had
already
commenced
the
sleeping
drunkard
there
had
read
the
letter
after
all
it
might
be
a
mere
joke
a
burlesque
an
affair
and
if
so
it
was
properly
his
business
to
discover
it
and
to
make
the
explanation
to
van
zandt
and
if
on
the
other
hand
it
should
be
really
a
confession
of
criminal
feeling
it
was
his
duty
to
be
informed
of
that
also
in
order
that
he
might
be
able
to
protect
the
domestic
peace
of
his
daughter
he
read
the
letter
through
and
then
sat
down
on
the
regardless
of
the
driving
rain
there
was
no
charitable
doubt
possible
in
the
matter
the
writer
was
a
guilty
woman
and
she
addressed
a
guilty
man
the
letter
alluded
clearly
and
even
grossly
to
past
assignations
and
fixed
the
day
and
hour
for
a
future
one
carter
name
did
not
appear
except
on
the
envelope
but
his
avocations
and
business
hours
were
alluded
to
the
fact
of
their
voyage
together
to
new
york
was
mentioned
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
the
man
the
doctor
was
more
miserable
than
he
remembered
to
have
been
before
since
the
death
of
his
wife
after
half
an
hour
of
wretched
meditation
walking
meanwhile
up
and
down
the
puddles
which
had
collected
on
the
earthen
floor
of
the
shanty
he
became
aware
that
the
rain
had
ceased
and
set
out
on
his
miserable
walk
homeward
should
he
destroy
the
letter
should
he
give
it
to
larue
and
crush
her
should
he
send
it
to
carter
should
he
show
it
to
lillie
how
could
he
answer
any
one
of
these
horrible
questions
what
right
had
fate
to
put
such
questions
to
him
it
was
not
his
crime
on
reaching
home
he
changed
his
wet
clothes
put
the
billet
in
his
sat
down
to
the
and
tried
to
seem
cheerful
but
lillie
soon
asked
him
what
is
the
matter
with
you
papa
i
got
wet
my
dear
it
was
a
very
hard
walk
back
through
the
mud
i
am
quite
worn
out
i
believe
i
shall
go
to
bed
early
she
repeated
her
question
two
or
three
times
not
that
she
suspected
the
truth
or
suspected
anything
more
than
just
what
he
told
her
but
because
she
was
anxious
about
his
health
and
because
she
had
a
habit
of
putting
many
questions
even
in
the
absorption
of
his
inexplicable
trouble
she
worried
him
so
that
he
grew
fretful
at
her
importunity
and
answered
her
crisply
that
he
was
well
enough
and
needed
nothing
but
quiet
then
suddenly
he
repented
himself
with
invisible
tears
wondering
at
his
irrational
and
seemingly
cruel
peevishness
and
seeming
to
excuse
himself
to
himself
by
calling
to
mind
that
he
was
tormented
on
her
account
he
almost
had
a
return
of
his
vexation
when
lillie
commenced
upon
him
about
her
husband
asking
is
it
time
to
hear
papa
and
how
soon
do
you
think
i
will
get
a
letter
very
soon
my
dear
he
replied
gloomily
remembering
the
wicked
letter
in
his
pocket
and
clenching
his
hands
under
the
table
to
resist
a
sudden
impulse
to
give
it
to
her
i
hope
there
will
be
no
more
battles
do
you
think
that
the
fighting
is
over
perhaps
it
may
be
best
for
him
to
have
a
battle
oh
no
papa
he
has
his
promotion
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
i
want
him
to
fight
any
more
the
father
made
no
answer
for
he
could
not
tell
her
what
he
thought
which
was
that
perhaps
her
husband
had
better
die
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
did
not
know
that
the
intrigue
had
terminated
here
comes
the
little
brigadier
said
lillie
when
the
baby
made
his
usual
irruption
into
the
parlor
is
he
sweet
she
asked
for
the
ten
thousandth
time
as
she
took
him
from
the
hands
of
the
nurse
and
put
him
in
her
father
lap
the
cooing
jumping
clinging
infant
clawing
at
and
spectacles
soft
helpless
and
harmless
gave
the
doctor
the
first
emotion
similar
to
happiness
which
he
had
felt
for
the
last
three
hours
how
we
fly
for
consolation
to
the
dependent
innocence
of
childhood
when
we
have
been
grievously
and
lastingly
wounded
by
the
perfidy
or
cruelty
of
the
adult
creatures
in
whom
we
had
put
our
trust
stricken
ones
who
have
no
children
sometimes
take
up
with
dogs
and
cats
knowing
that
if
they
are
feeble
they
are
also
faithful
but
with
the
baby
in
his
arms
ravenel
could
not
decide
what
to
do
with
the
baby
father
and
so
he
handed
the
boy
back
to
his
mother
saying
with
more
significance
of
manner
than
he
intended
there
my
dear
there
is
your
comfort
papa
you
are
sick
replied
lillie
looking
at
him
anxiously
do
lie
down
on
the
sofa
i
will
go
to
my
room
and
go
to
bed
said
he
it
is
eight
and
it
will
do
me
no
harm
if
i
sleep
twelve
hours
now
do
follow
me
my
child
do
tease
me
i
only
want
rest
after
kissing
her
and
the
child
he
hurried
away
for
he
heard
larue
coming
through
the
back
hall
toward
the
parlor
and
as
frequently
happens
the
innocent
had
not
the
audacity
to
face
the
guilty
in
the
passage
he
paused
glanced
back
through
the
crack
of
the
door
and
was
amazed
almost
infuriated
to
see
that
woman
kneel
at
lillie
feet
and
fondle
the
baby
with
her
usual
air
of
girlish
gayety
what
infernal
hypocrisy
he
muttered
as
he
turned
away
a
little
indignant
at
the
giggling
delight
with
which
ravvie
welcomed
the
visitor
his
charitable
philosophy
had
all
evaporated
for
the
time
and
he
could
not
believe
that
this
wicked
creature
had
a
spark
of
good
in
her
not
even
enough
to
smile
upon
a
child
honestly
to
his
mind
the
caresses
which
she
lavished
on
ravvie
were
part
of
a
plan
of
devilish
deceit
four
wretched
hours
passed
over
him
and
at
midnight
he
was
still
undecided
what
to
do
there
were
fathers
in
louisiana
who
did
not
mind
this
sort
of
thing
but
he
could
not
understand
those
fathers
he
minded
it
there
were
fathers
who
would
simply
say
to
an
erring
over
a
glass
of
wine
now
look
here
my
dear
sir
you
must
be
cautious
about
publicity
or
who
would
quietly
send
larue
her
letter
with
a
note
politely
requesting
that
she
would
make
arrangements
which
would
not
interfere
with
the
quiet
of
yours
very
respectfully
etc
but
such
fathers
could
not
love
their
daughters
as
he
loved
his
and
could
not
have
such
a
daughter
as
he
had
to
be
false
to
lillie
was
an
almost
unparalleled
crime
a
crime
which
demanded
not
only
reproach
but
punishment
a
crime
which
if
passed
over
would
derange
the
moral
balance
of
the
universe
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
show
lillie
the
letter
and
take
her
away
from
this
unworthy
husband
and
carry
her
north
or
somewhither
where
she
should
never
see
him
more
this
was
what
ought
to
be
but
then
it
might
kill
her
late
in
the
night
when
he
fell
asleep
on
the
outside
of
his
bed
still
dressed
his
light
still
burning
the
letter
in
his
hand
he
had
not
yet
decided
what
to
do
about
dawn
awakened
early
as
usual
by
the
creeping
of
ravvie
lillie
thought
of
her
father
and
slipping
on
a
stole
to
his
room
to
see
if
he
were
well
or
she
was
alarmed
to
find
him
dressed
and
looking
pale
and
sunken
before
she
had
decided
whether
to
let
him
sleep
on
or
to
awaken
him
and
tell
him
to
go
to
bed
as
a
sick
man
should
her
eye
fell
upon
the
letter
it
must
be
that
which
had
made
him
so
gloomy
and
strange
what
could
it
be
about
had
he
lost
his
place
at
the
hospital
that
need
not
trouble
him
for
her
husband
had
left
her
two
thousand
dollars
in
bank
and
he
would
not
object
to
have
her
share
it
with
her
father
her
husband
was
so
generous
and
loving
that
she
could
trust
his
affection
for
any
thing
she
was
accustomed
to
open
and
read
her
father
letters
without
asking
his
permission
she
took
up
this
one
and
glanced
through
it
with
delirious
haste
the
doctor
was
awakened
by
a
shriek
of
agony
and
found
lillie
senseless
on
the
floor
with
the
open
letter
under
her
hand
now
he
knew
what
to
do
she
must
go
far
away
at
once
she
must
never
again
see
her
husband
chapter
xxxii
a
most
logical
conclusion
when
lillie
came
to
her
senses
she
was
lying
on
her
father
bed
for
some
minutes
he
had
been
bending
over
her
watching
her
pulse
bathing
her
forehead
kissing
her
and
calling
her
by
name
in
a
hoarse
frightened
whisper
he
was
aware
that
insensibility
was
her
best
friend
but
he
must
know
at
once
whether
she
would
live
or
die
at
first
she
lay
quiet
silent
recollecting
trying
not
to
believe
then
she
suddenly
plunged
her
face
into
the
pillow
with
a
groan
of
unspeakable
anguish
it
was
not
for
five
or
ten
minutes
longer
not
until
he
had
called
her
by
every
imaginable
epithet
of
pity
and
tenderness
that
she
turned
toward
him
with
another
spasmodic
throe
clasped
his
head
to
her
bosom
and
burst
into
an
impetuous
sobbing
and
low
crying
still
she
did
not
speak
an
intelligible
word
her
teeth
were
set
firm
as
if
in
bodily
pain
and
her
sobs
came
through
her
parted
lips
she
would
not
look
at
him
either
and
kept
her
eyes
closed
or
turned
upward
distractedly
it
seemed
as
if
even
in
the
midst
of
her
anguish
she
was
stung
by
shame
at
the
nature
of
the
calamity
so
insulting
to
her
pride
as
a
woman
and
wife
after
a
while
this
paroxysm
ceased
and
she
lay
silent
again
while
another
icy
wave
of
despair
flowed
over
her
her
consciousness
being
expressed
solely
in
a
trembling
of
her
cheeks
her
lips
and
her
fingers
when
he
whispered
we
will
go
north
we
will
never
come
back
here
she
made
no
sign
of
assent
or
objection
she
did
not
answer
him
in
any
manner
until
he
asked
her
if
she
wanted
ravvie
but
then
she
leaped
at
the
proffered
consolation
the
gift
of
heaven
pity
with
a
passionate
yes
for
an
anxious
half
hour
the
doctor
left
her
alone
with
her
child
knowing
that
it
was
the
best
he
could
do
for
her
one
thing
he
must
attend
to
at
once
steps
must
be
taken
to
prevent
larue
from
crossing
his
daughter
sight
even
for
a
moment
see
the
woman
himself
he
could
not
not
at
least
until
she
were
dead
he
enclosed
her
billet
to
her
in
a
sealed
envelope
adding
the
following
note
which
cost
him
many
minutes
to
write
madame
the
accompanying
letter
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
my
daughter
she
is
dangerously
ill
i
hope
that
you
will
have
the
humanity
not
to
meet
her
again
when
the
housemaid
returned
from
delivering
the
package
he
said
to
her
julia
did
you
give
it
to
mrs
larue
yes
sah
did
you
give
it
into
her
own
hands
yes
sah
she
was
in
bed
an
i
gin
it
to
herself
what
how
did
she
look
asked
the
doctor
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
look
nohow
she
jess
lit
a
match
an
burned
the
letter
up
the
doctor
was
aghast
at
the
horrible
corruptness
implied
by
such
coolness
and
forethought
but
in
point
of
fact
larue
had
been
startled
far
beyond
her
common
wont
and
was
now
more
profoundly
grieved
than
she
had
ever
been
before
in
her
life
what
a
pity
she
said
several
times
to
herself
i
have
made
them
very
miserable
i
have
done
mischief
when
i
meant
none
why
did
the
stupid
creature
burn
the
letter
i
burned
all
his
what
a
pity
well
at
any
rate
it
will
go
no
farther
she
had
her
trunks
packed
and
drove
immediately
after
breakfast
to
carrollton
where
she
remained
secluded
in
the
hotel
until
she
found
a
private
boarding
house
in
the
unfrequented
outskirts
of
the
village
if
the
ravenels
moved
away
her
man
servant
was
to
inform
her
so
that
she
might
return
to
her
house
she
realized
perfectly
the
inhumanity
of
encountering
lillie
and
was
resolved
that
no
such
meeting
should
take
place
no
matter
what
might
be
the
expense
of
keeping
up
two
establishments
in
her
pity
and
regret
she
was
almost
willing
to
sell
her
house
at
a
loss
or
shut
it
up
without
rent
and
pinch
herself
in
some
northern
city
supposing
that
the
ravenels
concluded
to
stay
in
new
orleans
i
owe
them
that
much
she
thought
with
a
consciousness
of
being
generous
and
not
then
she
sighed
and
said
aloud
poor
lillie
i
am
so
sorry
for
her
but
she
has
a
baby
and
for
his
sake
she
will
forgive
her
husband
and
then
a
feeling
came
over
her
that
she
would
like
to
see
the
baby
and
that
it
would
have
been
a
pleasure
to
at
least
kiss
it
the
family
with
which
she
lived
consisted
of
a
man
of
sixty
and
his
wife
with
two
unmarried
daughters
of
and
thirty
the
parents
new
englanders
the
children
born
in
louisiana
but
all
alike
orthodox
devout
silent
after
the
old
fashion
of
new
england
the
father
was
a
cotton
broker
nearly
bankrupted
by
the
rebellion
and
was
glad
for
pecuniary
reasons
to
receive
a
respectable
boarder
such
a
household
larue
had
chosen
as
an
asylum
believing
that
she
would
be
benefited
just
now
by
an
odor
of
sanctity
if
it
were
only
derived
from
propinquity
something
might
get
out
lillie
might
go
delirious
and
make
disclosures
and
it
was
well
to
build
up
a
character
for
staidness
the
idea
of
entering
a
convent
she
rejected
the
moment
that
it
occurred
to
her
this
is
monastic
enough
she
thought
with
a
repressed
smile
as
she
looked
at
the
serious
faces
of
her
presbyterian
hosts
male
and
female
the
allens
became
as
much
infatuated
with
her
as
did
the
chaplain
on
board
the
creole
or
the
venerable
in
new
york
city
her
modest
and
retiring
manner
her
amiability
cheerfulness
and
sprightly
conversation
made
her
the
most
charming
person
in
their
eyes
that
they
had
ever
met
the
daughters
regained
something
of
their
blighted
youthfulness
under
the
sunny
influences
of
her
presence
aided
by
the
wisdom
of
her
counsel
and
the
cunning
of
her
fingers
in
matters
of
the
toilet
allen
kissed
her
with
motherly
affection
every
time
that
she
bade
the
family
the
old
trick
of
showing
a
mind
ripe
for
conversion
from
popery
was
played
with
the
usual
success
after
she
had
left
the
house
and
when
she
was
once
more
receiving
and
flirting
in
new
orleans
allen
used
to
excite
her
laughter
by
presenting
her
with
tracts
against
romanism
or
lending
her
volumes
of
sermons
by
eminent
protestant
divines
not
that
she
ever
laughed
at
him
to
his
face
she
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
striking
him
with
her
fist
she
was
too
and
to
commit
either
impertinence
for
the
sake
of
appearances
she
remained
in
the
country
a
week
or
more
after
the
ravenels
had
left
the
city
restored
to
her
own
house
she
found
herself
somewhat
lonely
for
lack
of
her
relatives
and
somewhat
gloomy
or
at
least
annoyed
when
she
thought
of
the
cause
of
the
separation
but
there
was
no
need
of
continuing
solitude
any
quantity
of
army
society
could
be
had
by
such
new
orleans
ladies
as
wished
it
and
larue
finally
resolved
to
break
with
treason
and
flirt
with
loyalty
in
gilt
buttons
in
a
short
time
her
parlor
was
frequented
by
gentlemen
who
wore
silver
leaves
and
eagles
and
stars
on
their
shoulders
and
the
loss
of
colonel
carter
was
more
than
made
up
to
her
by
the
devotion
of
persons
who
were
mightier
in
counsel
and
in
war
than
he
the
very
latest
news
from
her
is
of
a
highly
satisfactory
character
it
is
reported
that
she
was
fortunate
enough
to
gain
the
special
favor
of
an
official
personage
very
high
in
authority
in
some
unmentionable
department
of
the
south
who
as
a
mark
of
his
gratitude
gave
her
a
permit
to
trade
for
several
thousand
bales
of
cotton
this
curious
she
sold
to
a
new
york
speculator
for
fifteen
thousand
dollars
thereby
her
somewhat
dilapidated
fortunes
just
as
a
person
whose
dwelling
falls
about
his
head
is
sometimes
preserved
from
death
by
some
fragment
of
the
wreck
which
prostrates
him
but
preserves
him
from
the
mass
so
lillie
was
shielded
from
the
full
pressure
of
her
misery
by
a
short
fever
bringing
with
it
a
few
days
of
delirium
and
a
long
prostration
during
which
she
had
not
strength
to
feel
acutely
when
we
must
bend
or
break
nature
often
takes
us
in
her
own
pitying
hands
and
lays
us
gently
upon
beds
of
insensibility
or
thanks
be
to
heaven
for
the
merciful
opiate
of
sickness
during
the
fever
two
letters
arrived
from
carter
but
ravenel
put
them
away
without
showing
them
to
the
invalid
for
some
time
she
did
not
inquire
about
her
husband
when
she
thought
of
him
too
keenly
she
asked
with
a
start
for
her
baby
nature
continually
led
her
to
that
tender
helpless
speechless
potent
consoler
the
moment
it
was
safe
for
her
to
travel
ravenel
put
her
on
board
a
vessel
bound
to
new
york
choosing
a
sailing
craft
not
only
for
economy
sake
but
to
secure
the
benefit
of
a
lengthy
voyage
and
to
keep
longer
away
from
all
news
of
earth
and
men
she
made
no
objection
to
going
her
father
wished
it
to
be
so
it
was
right
enough
the
voyage
lasted
three
weeks
during
which
she
slowly
regained
strength
and
as
a
consequence
something
of
her
old
cheerfulness
and
hopefulness
the
doctor
had
a
strong
faith
that
she
would
not
be
broken
down
by
her
calamity
not
only
was
her
temper
gay
and
remarkable
for
its
elasticity
but
her
physical
constitution
seemed
to
partake
of
the
same
characteristics
and
she
had
always
recovered
from
sickness
with
rapidity
not
a
bit
disposed
to
brooding
taking
a
lively
interest
in
whatever
went
on
around
her
she
would
not
fall
an
easy
prey
to
confirmed
melancholy
the
doctor
never
alluded
to
her
husband
and
when
lillie
at
last
mentioned
his
name
it
was
merely
to
say
i
hope
he
will
not
be
killed
i
hope
not
replied
ravenel
gently
and
stopped
there
he
could
not
however
repress
a
brief
glance
of
surprise
and
investigation
could
it
be
that
she
would
come
to
forgive
that
man
had
he
been
too
hasty
in
dragging
her
away
from
new
orleans
and
giving
up
the
moderate
salary
which
was
so
necessary
to
them
both
but
no
it
would
kill
her
to
meet
larue
they
must
never
go
back
to
that
sodom
of
a
city
the
question
of
income
was
a
serious
one
he
was
nearly
at
the
end
of
his
own
resources
and
he
had
not
suffered
lillie
to
draw
any
of
her
perfidious
husband
money
but
he
did
not
dwell
much
on
these
pecuniary
questions
now
being
chiefly
occupied
with
the
moral
future
of
his
child
wondering
much
whether
she
would
indeed
forgive
her
husband
and
whether
she
would
ever
again
be
happy
of
course
it
was
not
until
they
reached
new
york
that
they
learned
the
events
which
i
must
now
relate
carter
joined
the
army
at
grande
ecore
just
before
it
resumed
field
operations
bailey
famous
dam
had
let
porter
out
of
his
trap
the
monitors
the
gunboats
the
admiral
were
on
their
way
down
the
river
it
was
too
late
to
go
to
shreveport
or
to
gather
cotton
and
so
the
column
set
out
rearward
that
it
was
strong
enough
to
take
care
of
itself
against
any
force
which
the
rebels
could
bring
to
cut
off
the
retreat
was
well
known
and
carter
assumed
command
of
his
new
brigade
with
a
sense
of
elation
at
the
prospect
of
fighting
which
he
had
little
reason
to
doubt
would
be
successful
by
the
last
gunboat
of
the
departing
fleet
he
sent
his
wife
a
letter
full
of
gay
anticipations
and
expressions
of
affection
which
she
was
destined
never
to
answer
by
the
last
transport
which
came
to
grande
ecore
arrived
a
letter
from
ravenel
which
owing
to
the
hastiness
of
the
march
did
not
reach
him
until
the
evening
before
the
battle
of
cane
river
in
the
glare
of
a
he
read
of
the
destruction
which
he
had
wrought
in
the
peace
of
his
own
family
ravenel
spoke
briefly
and
without
reproaches
of
the
discovery
stated
that
he
believed
it
to
be
his
duty
to
remove
his
child
from
the
scene
of
such
a
domestic
calamity
that
he
should
therefore
take
her
to
the
north
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
travel
i
beg
that
you
will
not
force
yourself
upon
her
he
concluded
hitherto
she
has
not
mentioned
your
name
to
me
and
i
do
not
know
what
may
be
her
feelings
with
regard
to
you
some
time
she
may
pardon
you
if
it
is
your
desire
to
be
pardoned
i
can
not
say
at
present
i
know
of
nothing
better
than
to
take
her
away
and
to
ask
your
forbearance
in
the
name
of
her
sickness
and
suffering
this
letter
was
a
cruel
blow
to
carter
if
the
staff
officers
who
sat
with
him
around
the
could
have
known
how
deeply
and
for
what
a
purely
domestic
reason
the
seemingly
stern
and
hard
general
was
suffering
they
would
have
been
very
much
amazed
he
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
a
man
of
the
world
with
bad
morals
and
a
calloused
heart
which
could
neither
feel
much
anguish
of
its
own
nor
sympathise
keenly
with
the
anguish
of
other
hearts
but
the
general
was
indeed
so
wretched
that
he
could
not
talk
with
them
and
could
not
even
sit
among
them
in
silence
he
went
on
one
side
and
walked
for
an
hour
up
and
down
in
the
darkness
he
tried
to
clear
up
the
whole
thing
in
his
mind
and
decide
distinctly
what
was
the
worst
that
had
happened
and
what
was
the
best
that
could
be
done
but
his
perceptions
were
very
tumultuous
and
incoherent
as
is
usually
the
case
with
a
man
when
first
overtaken
by
a
great
calamity
it
was
a
horrible
affair
it
was
a
cursed
infernal
affair
and
that
was
about
all
that
he
could
say
to
himself
he
was
intolerably
ashamed
as
well
as
grieved
and
angry
he
thought
very
little
about
larue
good
or
bad
he
was
not
mean
enough
to
curse
her
although
she
had
been
more
to
blame
than
he
only
he
did
wish
that
he
never
had
seen
her
and
did
curse
the
day
which
brought
them
together
on
the
creole
the
main
thing
after
all
was
that
he
had
his
wife
and
it
did
not
matter
who
had
been
his
accomplice
in
the
wicked
business
he
set
his
teeth
into
his
lips
and
felt
his
eyes
grow
moist
as
he
thought
of
her
sick
and
suffering
because
she
loved
him
and
he
had
not
been
worthy
of
her
love
would
she
ever
forgive
him
and
take
him
back
to
her
heart
he
did
not
know
he
would
try
to
win
her
back
he
would
fight
desperately
and
distinguish
himself
he
would
offer
her
the
best
impulses
and
bravest
deeds
of
manhood
perhaps
if
he
should
earn
a
star
and
high
fame
in
the
nation
and
then
should
go
to
her
feet
she
would
receive
him
a
transitory
thrill
of
pleasure
shot
through
him
as
he
thought
of
reconciliation
and
renewed
love
at
last
the
general
was
recalled
to
the
fire
to
read
orders
which
concerned
the
movements
of
the
morrow
and
to
transmit
them
to
the
regiments
of
his
own
command
then
he
had
to
receive
two
old
friends
regular
officers
of
the
artillery
who
called
to
congratulate
him
on
his
promotion
whiskey
was
produced
for
the
visitors
and
carter
himself
drank
freely
to
drown
trouble
when
they
went
away
about
midnight
he
found
himself
wearied
out
and
very
soon
dropped
asleep
for
he
was
a
soldier
and
could
slumber
under
all
circumstances
at
grande
ecore
the
red
river
throws
off
a
bayou
which
rejoins
it
below
the
two
currents
enclosing
an
island
some
forty
miles
in
length
this
bayou
now
called
the
cane
river
was
once
the
original
stream
and
in
memory
of
its
ancient
grandeur
flows
between
high
banks
altogether
out
of
proportion
to
its
modest
current
over
the
dead
level
of
the
island
the
army
had
moved
without
being
opposed
or
harassed
for
the
rebels
had
reserved
their
strength
to
crush
it
when
it
should
be
entangled
in
the
crossing
of
the
cane
river
taylor
with
his
arkansas
and
louisiana
infantry
had
followed
the
march
closely
but
warily
always
within
striking
distance
but
avoiding
actual
conflict
and
now
lay
in
line
of
battle
only
a
few
miles
in
rear
of
andrew
jackson
smith
western
boys
polignac
with
his
wild
texan
cavalry
had
made
a
great
circuit
and
already
held
the
bluffs
on
the
southern
side
of
the
cane
river
confronting
emory
two
divisions
of
the
nineteenth
corps
the
main
plan
of
the
battle
was
simple
and
inevitable
andrew
jackson
smith
must
beat
off
the
attack
of
taylor
and
emory
must
abolish
the
obstacle
of
polignac
the
veteran
and
wary
commander
of
the
nineteenth
corps
had
already
decided
how
he
would
go
over
his
ground
should
he
find
it
occupied
by
the
enemy
he
had
before
him
a
wood
of
considerable
extent
then
an
open
plain
eight
hundred
yards
across
and
then
a
valley
in
the
nature
of
a
ravine
at
the
bottom
of
which
flowed
a
river
not
fordable
here
and
with
no
crossing
but
a
ferry
a
single
narrow
road
led
down
through
a
deep
cut
to
the
edge
of
the
rapid
muddy
stream
and
starting
again
from
the
other
edge
rose
through
a
similar
gorge
until
it
disappeared
from
sight
behind
the
brows
of
high
bluffs
crowned
with
pines
under
the
pines
and
along
the
rim
of
the
bluffs
lay
the
line
of
polignac
there
had
been
no
time
to
reconnoitre
his
dispositions
indeed
his
presence
in
strong
force
was
not
yet
positively
known
to
the
leaders
of
the
union
army
but
if
there
his
horses
had
no
doubt
been
sent
to
the
rear
and
his
men
formed
to
fight
as
infantry
and
if
this
were
so
if
an
army
of
several
thousand
texan
riflemen
occupied
this
strong
position
how
should
it
be
carried
emory
had
already
decided
that
it
would
never
do
to
butt
at
it
in
front
and
that
it
could
only
be
taken
by
a
turning
movement
thus
this
part
of
the
battle
had
a
plan
of
its
own
such
was
the
military
situation
upon
which
our
new
brigadier
opened
his
heavy
eyes
at
three
on
the
morning
after
getting
that
woeful
letter
about
his
wife
the
army
was
to
commence
its
march
at
four
and
carter
was
aroused
by
the
bustle
of
preparation
from
the
vast
bivouac
thousands
of
men
were
engaged
in
rolling
their
blankets
putting
on
their
equipments
wiping
the
dew
from
their
rifles
and
eating
their
hasty
and
unsavory
breakfasts
of
companies
were
falling
in
the
voices
of
the
were
heard
calling
the
rolls
orders
resounded
indicating
the
formation
of
regimental
lines
the
whinnies
of
horses
the
braying
of
mules
and
the
barking
of
dogs
joined
in
the
clamor
but
as
yet
there
was
no
trampling
of
the
march
no
rolling
of
the
wheels
of
artillery
nothing
could
be
seen
of
this
populous
commotion
except
here
and
there
where
a
forbidden
cast
its
red
flicker
over
little
knots
of
crouching
soldiers
engaged
in
preparing
coffee
in
the
moment
of
coming
to
his
senses
and
before
memory
had
fully
resumed
its
action
the
general
was
vaguely
conscious
that
something
horrible
was
about
to
happen
or
had
already
happened
but
an
old
soldier
is
not
long
in
waking
up
especially
when
he
has
gone
to
sleep
in
the
expectation
of
a
battle
and
carter
knew
almost
instantaneously
what
was
the
nature
of
the
burden
that
weighed
upon
his
soul
he
lay
full
dressed
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
with
no
shelter
but
its
branches
he
was
quite
still
for
a
minute
or
more
staring
at
the
dark
sky
with
steady
gloomy
eyes
his
first
act
was
to
put
his
hand
to
the
breast
pocket
of
his
blouse
and
draw
out
that
cruel
letter
as
if
to
read
it
anew
by
the
flicker
of
a
fire
which
reached
his
resting
place
but
there
was
no
need
of
that
he
knew
all
that
was
in
it
as
soon
as
he
looked
at
the
envelope
he
remembered
at
once
even
the
blots
and
the
position
of
the
signature
next
the
sight
of
it
angered
him
and
he
thrust
it
back
crumpled
into
his
pocket
there
was
no
need
he
felt
of
making
so
much
of
the
affair
such
affairs
were
altogether
too
common
to
be
made
so
much
of
he
could
not
and
would
not
see
any
sense
in
the
conduct
he
sprang
to
his
feet
in
his
indignation
and
glared
fiercely
around
the
bivouac
of
his
brigade
how
this
he
growled
i
ordered
that
not
a
fire
should
be
lighted
van
zandt
did
you
pass
the
order
to
every
regiment
last
evening
i
did
sir
answers
our
old
acquaintance
now
a
staff
officer
thanks
to
his
dutch
courage
and
his
ability
with
the
pen
ride
off
again
stop
those
fires
instantly
my
god
the
fools
want
to
tell
the
enemy
just
when
we
start
this
outburst
raised
his
spirits
and
after
swallowing
a
cocktail
he
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
some
appetite
the
toughness
of
the
cold
boiled
chicken
and
the
dryness
and
hardness
of
the
army
biscuit
served
as
a
further
distraction
and
enabled
him
to
utter
a
joke
about
such
delicacies
being
very
suitable
for
projectiles
but
he
was
still
nervous
uneasy
eager
driven
by
the
sin
which
was
past
and
dragged
by
the
battle
which
was
before
so
that
any
long
reveling
at
the
banquet
was
impossible
he
quitted
the
empty
cracker
box
which
served
him
for
a
table
and
paced
grimly
up
and
down
until
his
orderly
came
to
buckle
on
his
sword
and
his
servant
brought
him
his
horse
how
are
the
cato
he
asked
oh
day
chuck
full
hull
cold
chicken
in
dis
yere
one
bottle
o
whisky
in
dis
yere
carter
swung
himself
slowly
and
heavily
into
his
saddle
he
was
weary
languid
and
feverish
with
want
of
sleep
and
trouble
of
mind
in
truth
he
was
physically
and
morally
a
much
discomforted
brigadier
general
without
waiting
for
other
directions
than
his
example
his
five
staff
officers
mounted
also
and
fell
into
a
group
behind
him
in
their
rear
was
the
brigade
escorted
by
the
sombre
dawn
was
turning
to
red
and
gold
in
the
east
a
monstrous
serpent
of
blue
and
steel
was
already
creeping
toward
the
ferry
increasing
in
length
as
additional
regiments
streamed
into
the
road
from
the
fields
which
had
served
for
the
bivouac
when
carter
had
seen
his
entire
brigade
file
by
he
set
off
at
a
canter
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
it
and
rode
on
at
a
walk
silent
and
gloomy
of
countenance
not
even
the
thought
that
he
was
now
a
general
and
had
a
chance
to
make
a
reputation
for
himself
as
well
as
for
others
could
enable
him
to
quite
throw
off
the
seriousness
and
anxiety
which
beclouds
the
minds
of
men
during
the
preliminaries
of
battle
the
remembrance
of
the
misery
which
he
had
wrought
for
his
wife
was
no
pleasant
distraction
it
was
like
a
foreboding
it
overshadowed
him
even
when
he
was
not
thinking
of
it
distinctly
it
seemed
to
have
a
menacing
arm
which
pointed
him
to
punishment
calamity
perhaps
a
grave
he
was
like
a
haunted
man
who
sees
his
following
phantom
if
he
turns
his
head
ever
so
little
nevertheless
when
he
squarely
faced
the
subject
and
dragged
it
out
separately
from
the
general
sombreness
of
the
situation
it
did
not
seem
such
a
very
hopeless
misfortune
it
surely
was
not
possible
that
she
had
broken
with
him
for
life
he
would
win
her
back
to
him
it
must
be
that
she
loved
him
enough
to
forgive
him
some
day
he
would
win
her
back
with
repentance
and
victories
as
he
thought
this
he
dashed
a
little
way
into
the
fields
gave
a
glance
at
the
line
of
his
brigade
and
dispatched
a
couple
of
his
staff
to
close
up
the
rearmost
files
of
his
regiments
presently
there
was
a
halt
something
probably
going
on
in
front
perhaps
a
reconnaisance
perhaps
battle
the
men
were
allowed
to
stack
arms
and
sit
down
by
the
roadside
then
came
news
enemy
in
force
at
the
crossing
a
direct
attack
in
front
out
of
the
question
turning
movements
to
be
made
somewhere
by
somebody
it
was
a
full
hour
after
sunrise
when
an
aid
of
general
emory
arrived
with
orders
for
general
carter
to
report
for
duty
to
general
birge
what
is
the
situation
asked
the
general
two
brigades
are
forming
in
front
replied
the
aid
we
have
an
immense
line
of
skirmishers
stretching
from
the
cane
river
on
the
right
all
along
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
out
into
the
fields
but
we
go
at
them
in
front
their
ground
is
nearly
a
hundred
feet
higher
than
ours
and
the
crossing
is
fordable
we
have
got
to
flank
them
closson
is
going
up
with
some
artillery
to
establish
a
position
on
our
left
and
from
that
the
cavalry
will
turn
the
right
wing
of
the
enemy
birge
is
to
do
the
same
thing
on
this
side
with
three
brigades
he
will
go
up
about
a
mile
three
miles
from
the
ferry
ford
the
river
fordable
up
there
come
round
on
the
fellows
and
give
it
to
them
over
the
left
very
good
said
carter
if
i
should
come
back
give
the
general
my
compliments
for
his
plan
much
obliged
lieutenant
at
this
moment
the
flat
dull
report
of
a
rifled
iron
gun
came
from
the
woods
far
away
in
front
followed
a
few
seconds
afterward
by
another
report
still
flatter
in
sound
and
much
more
distant
the
bursting
of
a
shell
there
goes
closson
laughed
the
young
officer
two
parrotts
and
four
rifles
he
wake
up
when
he
gets
fairly
good
luck
to
you
general
and
away
he
rode
gaily
at
a
gallop
in
the
direction
of
the
ferry
while
birge
column
countermarched
and
carter
brigade
filed
into
the
rear
of
it
the
cannonade
became
lively
in
the
front
the
crashes
of
the
guns
alternating
rapidly
with
the
crashes
of
the
shells
as
closson
went
in
with
all
his
six
pieces
and
a
rebel
battery
of
seven
responded
after
half
an
hour
of
this
the
enemy
found
that
a
range
of
two
thousand
yards
was
too
long
for
them
and
became
silent
then
closson
ceased
firing
also
and
waited
to
hear
from
birge
and
now
for
five
or
six
hours
there
was
no
more
sound
of
fighting
along
this
line
except
an
occasional
shot
from
the
skirmishers
aimed
at
puffs
of
rifle
smoke
which
showed
rarely
against
the
pines
of
the
distant
bluffs
the
infantry
column
struggled
over
its
long
detour
by
the
right
the
cavalry
tried
in
vain
to
force
a
way
through
the
jungles
on
the
left
the
centre
listened
to
the
roar
of
smith
battle
in
the
rear
and
lunched
and
waited
at
two
emory
put
everything
in
order
to
advance
whenever
musketry
should
give
notice
that
he
was
closely
engaged
closson
was
to
move
forward
on
the
left
and
fire
as
fast
as
he
could
load
the
remainder
of
the
artillery
was
to
gallop
down
the
river
road
to
the
ferry
and
open
with
a
dozen
or
fifteen
pieces
the
two
supporting
brigades
were
to
push
through
the
woods
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
cover
the
artillery
the
skirmishers
were
to
cross
the
river
wherever
they
could
ford
it
and
keep
up
a
heavy
fire
in
order
to
occupy
the
attention
of
the
enemy
closson
started
at
once
forced
five
of
his
rifles
through
the
wood
went
into
battle
at
a
range
of
a
thousand
yards
and
in
ten
minutes
dislodged
the
rebel
guns
from
their
position
but
all
this
was
mere
feinting
the
heavy
fighting
must
be
done
by
birge
the
flanking
column
had
a
hard
road
to
travel
after
fording
the
cane
river
it
entered
a
country
of
thickets
swamps
and
gullies
so
difficult
of
passage
that
five
hours
were
spent
in
marching
barely
five
miles
two
regiments
were
deployed
in
advance
as
skirmishers
the
others
followed
in
columns
of
division
doubled
on
the
centre
at
one
time
the
whole
force
went
into
line
of
battle
on
a
false
alarm
of
the
near
presence
of
the
enemy
then
the
nature
of
the
ground
forced
it
to
move
for
nearly
a
mile
in
the
ordinary
column
of
march
it
floundered
through
swampy
undergrowths
it
forded
a
deep
and
muddy
bayou
about
two
in
the
afternoon
it
came
out
upon
a
clearing
in
full
view
of
a
bluff
forty
or
fifty
feet
in
height
flanked
on
one
side
by
the
river
and
on
the
other
by
a
marshy
jungle
connecting
with
a
lake
along
the
brow
of
this
bluff
lay
polignac
left
wing
an
unknown
force
of
texan
riflemen
all
good
shots
and
impetuous
fighters
elated
moreover
with
pursuit
and
the
expectation
of
victory
here
carter
received
an
order
to
charge
with
his
brigade
very
good
he
answered
in
a
loud
satisfied
confident
tone
at
the
same
time
throwing
away
his
segar
let
me
look
at
things
first
i
want
to
see
where
to
go
in
a
single
glance
told
him
that
the
river
side
was
unassailable
he
galloped
to
the
right
inspected
the
boggy
jungle
glared
at
the
lake
beyond
and
decided
that
nothing
could
be
done
in
that
quarter
returning
to
the
brigade
he
once
more
surveyed
the
ground
in
its
front
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
down
a
high
fence
cross
an
open
field
take
down
a
second
fence
and
advance
up
the
hill
under
a
close
fire
of
musketry
but
he
was
not
dispirited
by
the
prospect
he
was
no
longer
the
silent
sombre
man
of
the
morning
the
whizzing
of
the
texan
bullets
the
sight
of
the
butternut
uniforms
and
ugly
broadbrims
which
faced
him
had
cleared
his
deep
breast
of
oppression
and
called
the
fighting
fire
into
his
eyes
he
swore
loudly
and
gaily
he
would
flog
those
dirty
rapscallions
he
would
knock
them
high
and
dry
into
the
other
world
he
would
teach
them
not
to
get
in
his
way
go
to
the
regimental
commanders
he
shouted
to
his
staff
officers
tell
them
to
push
straight
at
the
hill
tell
them
guide
right
on
went
the
regiments
four
in
number
keeping
even
pace
with
each
other
there
was
a
halt
at
the
first
fence
while
the
men
struggled
with
the
obstacle
climbing
it
in
some
places
and
pushing
it
over
in
others
the
general
brow
darkened
with
anxiety
lest
the
temporary
confusion
should
end
in
a
retreat
and

and
thither
cheering

my
fine
lads
he
said
down
with

now
then
get
into
your
ranks
get
along
my
lads
on
went
the

moving
at

at
a
ranks
closed
gaps
filled
unfaltering
heroic
the
dead
were
falling
the
wounded
were
crawling
in
numbers
to
the
rear
the
leisurely
hum
of
bullets
had
changed
into
the
sharp
multitudinous
of
close
firing
the
stifled
crash
of
balls
hitting
bones
and
the
soft
of
mingled
with
the
outcries
of
the
sufferers
the
bluff
in
front
was
smoking
rattling
wailing
with
the
incessant
but
the
front
of
the
brigade
remained
unbroken
and
its
rear
showed
no
stragglers
the
right
hand
regiment
floundered
in
a
swamp
but
the
other
hurried
on
without
waiting
for
it
as
the
momentum
of
the
movement
increased
as
the
spirits
of
the
men
rose
with
the
charge
a
stern
shout
broke
forth
something
between
a
hurrah
and
a
yell
swelling
up
against
the
rebel
musketry
and
defying
it
gradually
the
pace
increased
to
a
and
the
whole
mass
ran
for
an
eighth
of
a
mile
through
the
whistling
bullets
the
second
fence
disappeared
like
and
up
the
slope
of
the
hill
struggled
the
panting
regiments
when
the
foremost
ranks
had
nearly
reached
the
summit
a
sudden
silence
stifled
the
musketry
line
wavered
ceased
firing
broke
and
went
to
the
rear
in
confusion
the
clamor
of
the
charging
yell
redoubled
for
a
moment
and
then
died
in
the
rear
of
a
tremendous
volley
now
the
union
line
was
firing
and
now
the
rebels
were
falling
such
was
the
charge
which
carried
the
crossing
and
gained
the
battle
of
cane
river
but
john
carter
had
already
fallen
gloriously
in
the
arms
of
victory
at
the
moment
that
the
fatal
shot
struck
him
he
had
forgotten
his
guilt
and
remorse
in
the
wild
joy
of
successful
battle
he
was
on
horseback
closely
following
his
advancing
brigade
and
watching
its
spirited
push
and
listening
to
its
mad
yell
with
such
a
smile
of
soldierly
delight
and
pride
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
look
upon
his
bronzed
confident
heroic
face
it
would
have
been
strange
to
a
civilian
to
hear
the
stream
of
joyful
curses
with
which
he
expressed
his
admiration
and
elation
god
damn
them
see
them
go
in
he
said
god
damn
their
souls
i
can
put
them
anywhere
he
had
just
uttered
these
words
when
a
struck
him
in
the
left
side
just
below
the
ribs
with
a
which
was
audible
ten
feet
from
him
in
spite
of
the
noise
of
the
battle
he
started
violently
in
the
saddle
and
then
bent
slowly
forward
laying
his
right
hand
on
the
horse
mane
he
was
observed
to
carry
his
left
hand
twice
toward
the
wound
without
touching
it
as
if
desirous
yet
fearful
of
ascertaining
the
extent
of
the
injury
the
blow
was
mortal
and
he
must
have
known
it
yet
he
retained
his
ruddy
bronze
color
for
a
minute
or
two
with
the
assistance
of
two
staff
officers
he
dismounted
and
walked
eight
or
ten
yards
to
the
shade
of
a
tree
uttering
not
a
groan
and
only
showing
his
agony
by
the
manner
in
which
he
bent
forward
and
the
spasmodic
clutch
with
which
he
held
to
those
supporting
shoulders
but
when
he
had
been
laid
down
it
was
visible
enough
that
there
was
not
half
an
hour
life
in
him
his
breath
was
short
his
forehead
was
thickly
beaded
with
a
cold
perspiration
and
his
face
was
of
an
ashy
pallor
stained
with
streaks
of
ghastly
yellow
tell
colonel
gilliman
he
said
mentioning
the
senior
colonel
of
the
brigade
and
then
paused
to
catch
his
breath
before
he
resumed
tell
him
to
keep
straight
forward
these
were
the
first
words
that
he
had
spoken
since
he
was
hit
his
voice
had
already
sunk
from
a
clear
sonorous
bass
to
a
hoarse
whisper
presently
as
the
smoking
and
roaring
surge
of
battle
rolled
farther
to
the
front
a
chaplain
and
a
surgeon
came
up
followed
by
several
ambulance
men
bearing
stretchers
the
chaplain
was
attached
to
old
regiment
and
had
served
under
him
since
its
formation
the
surgeon
a
creole
by
birth
a
frenchman
by
education
philosophical
and
rou√©
belonged
to
a
louisiana
loyal
regiment
and
had
known
the
general
in
other
days
when
he
was
a
dissipated
spendthrift
lieutenant
of
the
regular
army
stationed
at
baton
rouge
he
gave
him
a
large
cup
of
whiskey
uncovered
the
wound
probed
it
with
his
finger
and
said
nothing
looked
nothing
why
do
you
do
something
whispered
the
chaplain
eagerly
and
almost
weeping
i
have
done
all
that
is
essential
he
replied
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
how
do
you
feel
general
asked
the
chaplain
turning
to
his
dying
commander
going
was
the
whispered
answer
going
oh
going
where
implored
the
other
sinking
on
his
knees
general
have
you
thought
of
the
sacrifice
of
jesus
christ
for
a
moment
carter
deep
voice
returned
to
him
as
fixing
his
stern
eyes
on
the
chaplain
he
answered
do
bother
where
is
the
brigade
perhaps
he
thought
it
unworthy
of
him
to
seek
god
in
his
extremity
when
he
had
neglected
him
in
all
his
hours
of
health
perhaps
he
felt
that
he
owed
his
last
thoughts
to
his
country
and
his
professional
duties
perhaps
he
did
not
mean
all
that
he
said
it
was
strange
to
note
the
power
of
military
discipline
upon
the
chaplain
even
in
this
awful
hour
when
it
was
his
part
to
fear
no
man
he
evidently
quailed
before
his
superior
officer
under
the
pressure
of
a
three
years
habit
of
obedience
and
respect
cowed
by
rank
and
that
audacious
will
accustomed
to
domination
he
shrank
back
into
silence
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
and
no
doubt
praying
but
uttering
no
further
word
general
the
brigade
has
carried
the
position
said
one
of
the
carter
smiled
tried
to
raise
his
head
dropped
it
slowly
drew
a
dozen
labored
breaths
and
was
dead
a
maintenu
bout
son
said
the
surgeon
letting
fall
the
extinct
pulse
mort
est
tout
ce
y
a
de
plus
so
he
thought
and
very
naturally
he
had
only
known
him
in
his
evil
hours
he
judged
him
as
all
superficial
acquaintances
would
have
judged
he
was
not
aware
of
the
tenderness
which
existed
at
the
bottom
of
that
passionate
nature
with
another
education
carter
might
have
been
a
james
brainard
or
a
vincent
de
paul
with
the
training
that
he
had
it
was
perfectly
logical
that
in
his
last
moments
he
should
not
want
to
be
bothered
about
jesus
christ
the
body
was
borne
on
a
stretcher
in
rear
of
the
victorious
columns
until
they
halted
for
the
night
when
it
was
buried
in
the
private
cemetery
of
a
planter
in
presence
of
carter
former
regiment
among
the
spectators
was
colburne
stricken
with
real
grief
as
he
thought
of
the
bereaved
wife
throughout
the
army
the
regret
was
general
and
earnest
over
the
loss
of
this
brave
and
able
officer
apparently
just
entering
upon
a
career
of
promotion
in
a
letter
to
ravenel
colburne
related
the
particulars
of
carter
death
and
closed
with
a
fervent
eulogium
on
his
character
as
a
man
and
his
services
as
a
soldier
forgetting
that
he
had
sometimes
drunk
too
deeply
and
that
there
were
suspicions
against
him
of
other
vices
it
is
thus
that
young
and
generous
spirits
are
apt
to
remember
the
dead
and
it
is
thus
always
that
a
soldier
laments
for
a
worthy
commander
who
has
fallen
on
the
field
of
honor
chapter
xxxiii
lillie
devotes
herself
entirely
to
the
rising
generation
lillie
wished
to
return
at
least
for
a
while
to
her
old
quarters
in
the
new
boston
house
a
desire
to
go
back
by
association
to
some
part
of
her
life
which
had
been
happy
may
have
influenced
her
in
this
choice
and
she
was
so
quietly
earnest
in
it
that
her
father
yielded
although
he
feared
that
the
recollections
connected
with
the
place
would
increase
her
melancholy
they
had
been
there
only
three
days
when
he
read
with
a
shock
the
newspaper
report
of
the
battle
of
cane
river
and
the
death
of
the
lamented
general
carter
he
did
not
dare
mention
it
to
her
and
sought
to
keep
the
journals
out
of
her
reach
this
was
easy
enough
for
she
never
went
out
alone
rarely
spoke
to
any
one
but
her
father
and
devoted
her
time
mostly
to
her
child
and
her
sewing
but
about
a
week
after
their
arrival
as
the
doctor
came
in
to
dinner
from
a
reading
in
the
college
library
he
found
her
weeping
quietly
over
a
letter
which
lay
open
in
her
lap
she
handed
it
to
him
merely
saying
oh
papa
he
glanced
through
it
hastily
it
was
colburne
account
of
death
i
knew
this
my
dear
he
said
but
i
did
not
dare
to
tell
you
i
hope
you
are
able
to
bear
it
there
is
a
great
deal
to
bear
in
this
world
but
it
is
for
our
good
oh
i
do
know
she
replied
with
a
weary
air
she
was
thinking
not
of
his
general
consolations
but
of
his
hope
that
she
could
endure
her
trial
for
a
trial
it
was
this
sudden
death
of
her
husband
though
she
had
thought
of
him
of
late
only
as
separated
from
her
forever
after
a
short
silence
she
sobbed
i
am
so
sorry
i
quarreled
with
him
i
wish
i
had
written
to
him
that
i
was
not
angry
she
went
on
crying
but
not
passionately
nor
with
a
show
of
unendurable
sorrow
from
that
time
as
he
watched
the
patient
tranquillity
of
her
grief
the
doctor
conceived
a
firm
hope
that
she
would
not
be
permanently
crushed
by
her
afflictions
she
kept
the
letter
in
her
own
writing
desk
and
read
it
many
times
when
alone
sometimes
laying
it
down
with
a
start
to
take
up
the
unconscious
giggling
comforter
in
the
cradle
sometimes
telling
him
what
it
all
meant
and
what
her
tears
meant
saying
poor
baby
baby
papa
is
dead
only
once
did
an
expression
savoring
of
anger
at
any
one
force
its
way
through
her
lips
i
do
see
why
i
should
have
been
made
miserable
because
others
are
wicked
she
said
it
is
one
of
the
necessary
consequences
of
living
answered
the
doctor
other
people
sins
are
sometimes
brought
to
our
doors
just
as
other
people
infants
are
sometimes
left
there
in
baskets
god
has
ordained
that
we
shall
help
bear
the
burdens
of
our
fellow
creatures
even
down
to
the
consequences
of
their
crimes
it
is
one
way
of
teaching
us
not
to
sin
i
have
had
my
small
share
of
this
unpleasant
labor
i
lost
my
home
and
my
income
because
a
few
men
wanted
to
found
a
oligarchy
on
the
ruins
of
their
country
we
have
had
nothing
but
trials
sighed
lillie
oh
yes
said
the
doctor
life
in
the
average
is
a
mass
of
happiness
only
dotted
here
and
there
by
trials
our
pleasures
are
so
many
that
they
grow
monotonous
and
are
overlooked
i
must
now
include
the
history
of
eight
months
in
a
few
pages
the
doctor
ignorant
of
the
steamboat
transaction
allowed
his
daughter
to
draw
the
money
which
she
had
left
behind
on
deposit
considering
that
carter
child
unquestionably
had
a
right
to
it
through
the
good
offices
of
that
amiable
sinner
larue
of
which
he
was
equally
unaware
he
was
enabled
to
let
his
house
in
new
orleans
as
a
government
office
thus
provided
with
ready
money
and
a
small
quarterly
payment
he
resumed
his
literary
and
scientific
labors
translating
from
a
french
encyclopedia
for
a
new
york
publisher
and
occasionally
securing
a
job
of
mineralogical
discovery
the
familiar
life
of
former
days
when
father
and
daughter
were
all
and
all
to
each
other
slowly
revived
saddened
by
recollections
but
made
joyful
also
by
the
new
affection
which
they
shared
as
out
of
the
brazen
vase
of
the
arabian
nights
arose
the
malignant
jinn
whose
head
touched
the
clouds
and
whose
voice
made
the
earth
tremble
so
out
of
the
cradle
of
ravvie
arose
an
influence
perhaps
a
veritable
angel
whose
crown
was
in
the
heavens
and
whose
power
brought
down
consolation
there
was
no
cause
of
inner
estrangement
nothing
on
which
father
and
child
could
not
feel
alike
ravenel
had
found
some
difficulty
in
liking
his
daughter
husband
but
he
had
none
at
all
in
loving
his
daughter
baby
so
agreeing
on
all
subjects
of
much
importance
to
either
and
disposed
by
affection
and
old
habit
to
take
a
strong
interest
in
each
other
affairs
they
easily
returned
to
their
former
ways
of
much
domestic
happily
for
lillie
she
was
not
taciturn
but
a
prattler
and
by
nature
a
one
now
prattlers
like
workers
of
all
kinds
physical
and
moral
unconsciously
dodge
by
their
activity
a
great
many
shafts
of
suffering
which
hit
their
quieter
brothers
and
sisters
a
widow
who
orders
her
mourning
and
waits
for
it
with
folded
hand
and
closed
lips
is
likely
to
be
more
melancholy
than
a
widow
who
must
trim
her
gowns
and
make
up
her
caps
with
her
own
fingers
and
who
is
thereby
impelled
to
talk
of
them
to
her
mother
sisters
and
other
born
sympathisers
it
was
a
symptom
of
returning
health
of
mind
when
lillie
could
linger
before
the
glass
arrange
her
hair
with
the
old
taste
put
on
a
new
cap
daintily
and
say
papa
how
does
that
look
very
well
my
dear
answers
papa
scratching
away
at
his
translation
then
remembering
what
his
child
had
suffered
and
transferring
his
thoughts
to
the
subject
which
she
proffers
for
consideration
he
adds
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
unnecessarily
stiff
and
parchment
like
it
looks
as
if
it
was
made
of
stearine
why
that
the
material
says
lillie
of
course
it
looks
stiff
it
ought
to
but
why
not
have
some
other
material
queries
the
doctor
who
is
as
dull
as
men
usually
are
in
matters
of
the
female
toilet
why
not
use
white
silk
or
something
silk
papa
exclaims
lillie
and
laughs
heartily
who
ever
heard
of
using
silk
for
mourning
woe
to
women
when
they
give
up
making
their
own
dresses
and
take
to
female
tailors
five
will
then
die
of
broken
hearts
of
ennui
of
emptiness
of
life
where
one
dies
now
but
her
great
diverter
and
comforter
was
still
her
child
like
most
women
she
was
born
for
maternity
more
distinctly
and
positively
even
than
for
love
she
had
not
given
up
her
dolls
until
she
was
fourteen
and
then
she
had
put
them
reverentially
and
tenderly
away
in
a
trunk
where
she
could
occasionally
go
and
look
at
them
and
less
than
seven
years
later
she
had
a
living
doll
her
own
her
soul
doll
to
care
for
and
worship
it
was
charming
to
see
this
slender
form
overloaded
and
leaning
but
still
bearing
with
an
affection
which
was
careless
of
fatigue
the
disproportionate
weight
of
that
healthy
succulent
ponderous
ravvie
his
pink
face
and
short
flaxen
hair
bobbed
about
her
shoulders
and
his
chubby
hands
played
with
her
nose
lips
hair
and
white
collars
when
he
went
out
on
an
airing
she
almost
always
went
with
him
and
sometimes
took
the
sole
charge
of
his
wicker
wagon
proud
to
drag
it
because
of
its
illustrious
burden
ravvie
had
a
promenade
in
the
morning
with
mamma
and
nurse
and
another
late
in
the
afternoon
with
mamma
and
grandpapa
lillie
meant
to
make
him
healthy
by
keeping
him
constantly
in
the
open
air
and
burning
him
brown
in
the
sunshine
after
the
sensible
fashion
of
southern
nurseries
and
in
consonance
with
the
teaching
of
her
father
the
old
irish
nurse
a
veteran
and
enthusiast
in
her
profession
had
more
than
one
contest
with
this
provokingly
devoted
mother
not
that
rosann
objected
to
the
child
being
out
she
would
have
been
glad
to
have
him
in
the
wicker
wagon
from
breakfast
to
dinner
and
from
dinner
to
sundown
but
she
wanted
to
be
the
sole
guide
and
companion
of
his
wanderings
when
therefore
she
was
ordered
to
stay
at
home
and
do
the
small
washing
and
ironing
while
the
mistress
went
off
with
the
baby
she
set
up
an
indignant
ullaloo
and
threatened
departure
without
warning
sometimes
lillie
was
satirical
and
said
rosann
since
you
ca
nurse
the
baby
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
do
so
to
which
rosann
with
irish
readiness
and
with
an
apologetic
titter
would
reply
an
since
god
allows
ye
to
do
it
i
do
see
as
i
can
make
an
objection
i
would
turn
her
away
if
she
was
so
fond
of
ravvie
affirmed
lillie
in
a
pet
she
is
the
most
selfish
creature
that
i
ever
saw
she
wants
him
the
whole
time
i
declare
papa
i
only
keep
her
out
of
pity
i
believe
it
would
break
her
heart
to
deprive
her
of
the
child
it
a
very
odd
sort
of
selfishness
observed
the
doctor
most
people
would
call
it
devotion
or
something
of
that
sort
but
he
is
her
child
answered
lillie
half
vexed
half
smiling
she
thinks
he
is
i
actually
believe
she
thinks
that
she
had
him
but
she
did
i
did
she
tossed
her
head
with
a
pretty
air
of
defiance
which
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
was
not
ashamed
of
the
feat
long
before
master
ravvie
could
say
a
word
in
any
language
she
had
commenced
the
practice
of
talking
to
him
only
in
french
he
should
be
a
linguist
from
his
cradle
and
she
herself
would
be
his
teacher
when
he
got
old
enough
her
father
should
instruct
him
in
the
sciences
and
if
he
chose
to
be
a
doctor
in
the
theory
and
practice
of
medicine
they
would
never
send
him
to
school
nor
to
college
thus
they
would
save
money
have
him
always
by
them
and
keep
him
from
evil
concerning
this
project
she
had
long
arguments
with
her
father
who
thought
a
boy
should
be
with
boys
learn
to
rough
it
away
from
home
study
human
nature
as
well
as
languages
and
sciences
and
grow
up
with
a
circle
of
emulators
and
life
comrades
you
will
give
up
this
little
plan
of
yours
he
said
when
he
gets
old
enough
to
make
it
necessary
when
he
is
fifteen
he
wo
wear
the
shell
that
fits
him
now
and
meantime
we
must
let
another
one
grow
on
his
back
against
he
needs
it
but
lillie
could
not
yet
see
that
her
child
ought
even
to
be
separated
from
her
she
was
constantly
arranging
and
her
imaginary
future
in
such
ways
as
seemed
best
fitted
to
make
him
a
permanent
feature
of
it
in
every
that
she
built
he
occupied
a
central
throne
with
her
father
sitting
on
the
right
hand
and
she
on
the
left
of
course
however
she
was
chiefly
occupied
with
his
present
desiring
to
make
it
as
delightful
to
him
as
possible
i
wonder
if
ravvie
would
like
the
she
said
on
one
of
the
first
warm
days
of
summer
why
so
asks
papa
oh
it
would
be
so
pleasant
to
spend
a
week
or
so
on
the
i
think
i
could
get
a
little
fatter
and
stronger
if
i
might
have
the
and
i
am
tired
of
being
so
thin
besides
it
would
be
such
fun
to
take
ravvie
down
to
the
beach
and
see
him
stare
at
the
waves
rolling
in
how
round
his
eyes
would
be
do
you
remember
how
he
used
to
turn
his
head
up
when
he
was
a
month
old
and
stare
at
the
sky
with
his
eyes
set
like
a
i
wish
i
knew
what
he
used
to
think
of
it
i
presume
he
thought
just
about
as
much
as
the
hollyhocks
do
when
they
turn
their
faces
toward
the
sun
says
the
doctor
for
shame
papa
do
you
compare
him
to
a
vegetable
not
now
but
in
those
days
he
was
only
a
grade
above
one
there
much
in
him
but
possibilities
well
he
may
have
perceived
that
the
sky
was
very
fine
but
then
the
hollyhocks
perceive
as
much
what
do
you
suppose
he
had
a
soul
oh
yes
he
had
a
tongue
too
but
he
had
learned
to
talk
with
it
i
doubt
whether
his
soul
was
of
much
use
to
him
in
that
stage
of
his
existence
papa
it
seems
to
me
that
you
talk
like
an
infidel
now
if
ravvie
had
died
when
he
was
a
month
old
i
should
have
expected
to
meet
him
in
heaven
that
is
if
i
am
ever
fit
to
go
there
i
have
no
doubt
you
would
no
doubt
of
it
affirmed
the
doctor
with
animation
i
never
intended
to
dispute
the
little
man
immortality
then
why
did
you
call
him
a
hollyhock
my
dear
i
take
it
all
back
he
is
a
hollyhock
and
never
was
if
we
can
hire
a
house
i
want
it
in
the
suburbs
said
lillie
after
a
meditation
i
want
it
outside
the
city
so
that
ravvie
can
have
plenty
of
air
his
room
must
be
on
the
sunny
side
papa
hear
yes
answered
papa
who
had
also
had
his
revery
probably
concerning
smithites
and
brownites
you
do
hear
at
all
said
lillie
you
do
pay
any
attention
well
my
child
there
is
plenty
of
time
we
have
a
house
for
the
next
five
minutes
i
know
it
not
for
five
years
perhaps
but
i
want
you
to
pay
attention
when
i
am
talking
about
ravvie
meantime
the
two
were
very
popular
in
new
boston
as
southern
refugees
as
martyrs
in
the
cause
of
loyalty
as
an
organizer
of
free
black
labor
as
the
widow
of
a
distinguished
union
officer
both
and
each
were
personages
whom
the
fervent
federalists
of
the
little
city
delighted
to
honor
as
soon
as
they
would
receive
calls
or
accept
of
new
acquaintances
they
had
all
that
they
wanted
professor
whitewood
had
been
killed
at
chancellorsville
although
bodily
more
than
three
hundred
miles
from
the
field
of
battle
and
his
son
was
now
worth
eighty
thousand
dollars
besides
seven
hundred
dollars
yearly
from
a
tutorship
and
the
prospect
of
succeeding
to
his
father
position
this
virtuous
amiable
and
intelligent
young
gentleman
was
more
than
suspected
of
being
in
love
with
the
penniless
widow
his
sister
made
the
affair
a
subject
of
much
meditation
and
even
of
prayer
being
anxious
above
all
things
on
earth
that
her
brother
should
be
happy
whitewood
was
more
than
once
observed
to
drop
his
hindustani
sidle
out
upon
the
green
and
beg
the
privilege
of
drawing
ravvie
and
what
was
particularly
suspicious
about
the
matter
was
that
he
never
attempted
to
join
rosann
in
this
manner
but
only
carter
lillie
colored
at
the
significance
of
the
request
and
would
not
consent
to
it
but
nevertheless
was
not
angry
her
bookish
interest
in
her
increased
when
he
found
that
she
aided
her
father
in
his
translations
for
from
his
childhood
he
had
been
taught
to
like
people
very
much
in
proportion
to
their
intellectuality
and
education
of
evenings
he
was
frequently
to
be
seen
in
the
little
parlor
of
the
ravenels
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
new
boston
house
lillie
would
have
been
glad
to
have
him
bring
his
sister
so
that
they
four
could
make
up
a
game
of
whist
but
since
the
dawn
of
history
no
whitewoods
had
ever
handled
a
pack
of
cards
and
the
capacity
of
learning
to
do
so
was
not
in
them
moreover
they
still
retained
some
of
the
old
new
england
scruples
of
conscience
on
the
subject
whitewood
talked
quite
as
much
with
the
doctor
as
with
lillie
quite
as
much
about
minerals
and
chemistry
as
about
subjects
with
which
she
was
familiar
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
if
he
had
known
how
he
would
have
made
his
conversation
altogether
feminine
at
precisely
ten
he
rose
with
a
start
and
sidled
to
the
door
stuck
there
a
few
moments
to
add
a
postscript
concerning
science
or
classic
literature
then
with
another
start
opened
the
door
and
said
good
evening
after
he
was
in
the
passage
how
awkward
he
is
lillie
would
sometimes
observe
yes
physically
was
the
doctor
answer
but
not
morally
i
see
that
he
tramples
on
any
one
feelings
or
breaks
any
one
heart
the
visitor
gone
father
and
daughter
walked
in
the
hall
while
rosann
opened
the
windows
for
ventilation
after
that
the
baby
cradle
was
dragged
into
the
parlor
with
much
ceremony
the
whole
family
either
directing
or
assisting
a
mattress
and
blankets
were
produced
from
a
closet
and
made
up
on
the
floor
into
a
bed
for
the
nurse
grandpapa
kissed
both
his
children
and
went
to
his
own
room
next
door
and
lillie
proceeded
to
undress
talking
to
rosann
about
ravvie
an
do
ye
know
what
the
little
crater
did
to
me
says
the
doting
irishwoman
he
jist
pulled
me
spectacles
off
me
nose
stuck
in
his
own
little
mouth
he
thought
mebbe
he
could
see
with
his
mouth
an
thin
he
lucked
me
full
in
the
face
as
cunnin
as
could
be
an
give
the
biggest
jump
that
iver
was
i
tell
ye
babies
is
smarter
now
than
they
used
to
be
this
remarkable
anecdote
with
the
nurse
commentary
being
repeated
to
the
doctor
in
the
morning
he
philosophised
as
follows
there
may
be
something
in
rosann
statement
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
babies
of
a
civilized
age
are
more
exquisitely
sensitive
beings
than
the
babies
of
antique
barbarism
it
may
be
that
at
my
birth
i
was
a
little
ahead
of
my
gallic
ancestor
at
his
birth
perhaps
i
was
able
to
compare
two
sensations
as
early
in
life
as
he
was
able
to
perceive
a
single
sensation
it
might
be
something
like
this
he
at
the
age
of
ten
days
would
be
capable
of
thinking
is
good
i
at
the
same
age
could
perhaps
go
so
far
as
to
think
is
better
than
mixture
babies
have
need
of
being
cleverer
than
they
used
to
be
they
have
more
dangers
to
evade
more
medicines
to
spit
out
i
know
what
you
mean
said
lillie
you
always
did
rebel
against
dally
but
what
was
i
to
do
he
have
the
colic
i
know
it
he
would
but
dally
could
help
it
do
for
sake
vitiate
and
torment
your
poor
little
angel
stomach
so
new
to
the
atrocities
of
this
world
with
drugs
these
mixers
of
baby
medicines
ought
to
be
fed
on
nothing
but
their
own
nostrums
that
would
soon
put
a
stop
to
their
inventions
of
the
adversary
oh
dear
sighed
lillie
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
him
sometimes
i
am
afraid
of
not
doing
enough
or
doing
too
much
then
the
ad
occurred
to
her
that
which
proves
nothing
and
which
women
love
so
well
but
you
have
given
him
things
papa
do
you
remember
the
red
fluid
i
never
gave
it
to
him
asserted
the
doctor
but
you
gave
it
to
me
to
give
to
him
when
you
threw
the
dally
out
of
the
window
and
do
you
know
what
the
red
fluid
was
no
it
did
him
good
it
was
just
as
powerful
as
the
dally
consequently
it
must
have
been
a
drug
it
was
pure
water
slightly
colored
that
was
all
upon
my
honor
as
we
say
down
south
it
used
to
amuse
me
to
see
you
drop
it
according
to
prescription
five
drops
for
a
dose
very
particular
not
to
give
him
six
he
might
have
drunk
the
vial
full
papa
said
lillie
when
she
had
fully
realized
this
awful
deception
you
have
a
great
many
sins
to
repent
of
poisoning
my
own
grandchild
is
not
one
of
them
thank
heaven
but
suppose
ravvie
had
become
really
sick
she
suggested
more
seriously
ah
what
a
clear
conscience
i
should
have
had
nobody
could
have
laid
it
to
me
how
healthy
and
strong
and
big
he
is
was
her
next
observation
he
will
be
like
you
i
would
bet
anything
that
he
will
be
six
feet
high
ravenel
laughed
at
a
bet
which
would
have
to
wait
some
sixteen
or
eighteen
years
for
a
decision
and
said
it
reminded
him
of
a
south
carolinian
who
offered
to
wager
that
in
the
year
two
thousand
slavery
would
prevail
the
world
over
this
whole
subject
of
infancy
perceptions
and
opinions
is
curious
he
observed
presently
what
a
world
it
would
be
if
it
were
exactly
as
these
little
people
see
it
yes
and
what
a
world
it
would
be
if
it
were
as
we
grown
people
see
it
in
our
different
moods
of
depression
exhilaration
vanity
spite
and
folly
i
suppose
that
only
deity
sees
it
truly
in
this
kind
of
life
the
spring
grew
into
summer
the
summer
sobered
into
autumn
and
the
autumn
began
to
grow
hoary
with
winter
eight
months
of
paternal
affection
received
and
maternal
cares
bestowed
had
decided
that
lillie
should
neither
die
of
her
troubles
nor
suffer
a
blighting
of
the
soul
in
bloom
she
was
what
she
used
to
be
in
expression
alone
had
she
suffered
a
change
sometimes
sudden
flashes
of
profoundly
felt
pain
troubled
her
eyes
as
she
thought
of
her
venture
of
love
and
its
great
shipwreck
she
had
not
the
slightest
feeling
of
anger
toward
her
husband
she
could
not
be
angry
with
the
buried
father
of
her
child
but
she
felt
and
sometimes
reproached
herself
for
it
that
his
crime
had
made
her
grieve
less
over
his
death
just
as
his
death
had
led
her
to
pardon
his
crime
she
often
prayed
for
him
not
that
she
believed
in
purgatory
and
its
deliverance
but
rather
because
the
act
soothed
painful
yearnings
which
she
could
not
dispel
by
reason
alone
her
devotional
tendencies
had
been
much
increased
by
her
troubles
in
fact
she
was
far
more
religious
than
some
of
the
straiter
new
bostonians
were
able
to
believe
when
they
knew
that
she
played
whist
and
noted
how
tastefully
she
was
dressed
and
how
charmingly
graceful
she
was
in
social
intercourse
she
never
went
to
sleep
without
reading
a
chapter
in
the
bible
and
praying
for
her
child
her
father
and
herself
it
is
possible
that
she
may
have
forgotten
the
heathen
the
jews
and
the
negroes
well
she
had
not
been
educated
to
think
much
of
far
away
people
but
rather
to
interest
herself
in
such
as
were
near
to
her
and
could
be
made
daily
happy
or
unhappy
by
her
conduct
she
almost
offended
whitewood
by
admitting
that
she
loved
ravvie
a
thousand
times
more
than
the
ten
tribes
or
as
called
them
the
wandering
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
nor
could
this
excellent
lady
enlist
her
interest
in
favor
of
the
doctrine
of
election
owing
perhaps
to
the
adverse
remarks
of
doctor
ravenel
my
dear
madame
he
said
let
us
try
to
be
good
repent
of
our
trust
in
the
atonement
and
leave
such
niceties
to
those
whose
business
it
is
to
discuss
them
doctrines
are
no
more
religion
than
geological
are
animated
nature
doctrines
are
the
footprints
of
piety
you
can
learn
by
them
where
men
have
trod
in
their
searchings
after
the
truth
but
they
are
not
in
themselves
religion
and
will
not
save
souls
but
think
of
the
great
and
good
men
who
have
made
these
doctrines
the
study
and
guide
of
their
lives
said
whitewood
think
of
our
puritan
forefathers
i
do
answered
the
doctor
i
think
highly
of
them
they
have
my
profoundest
respect
we
are
still
moving
under
the
impetus
which
they
gave
to
humanity
dead
as
they
are
they
govern
this
continent
at
the
same
time
they
must
have
been
disagreeable
to
live
with
their
doctrines
made
them
hard
in
thought
and
manner
when
i
think
of
their
grimness
uncharity
inclemency
i
am
tempted
to
say
that
the
sinners
of
those
days
were
the
salt
of
the
earth
of
course
whitewood
it
is
only
a
temptation
i
do
succumb
to
it
but
now
as
to
these
doctrines
as
to
merely
dogmatic
religion
it
reminds
me
of
a
story
this
story
goes
i
do
believe
it
that
an
ingenious
man
having
found
that
a
bandage
drawn
tight
around
the
waist
will
abate
the
pangs
of
hunger
set
up
a
on
the
idea
at
breakfast
the
waiters
strapped
up
each
boarder
with
a
stout
surcingle
at
dinner
the
waistbelts
were
drawn
up
another
hole
or
two
if
you
were
hungry
at
tea
there
was
another
pull
on
the
buckle
the
story
proceeds
that
one
dyspeptic
old
bachelor
found
himself
much
better
by
the
evening
of
the
second
day
but
that
the
other
guests
rebelled
and
left
the
house
in
a
body
denouncing
the
gentlemanly
proprietor
as
a
humbug
now
some
of
our
ethical
purveyors
remind
me
of
this
inventor
they
put
nothing
into
you
they
give
you
no
sustaining
food
they
simply
bind
your
soul
and
now
and
then
take
up
a
hole
in
your
moral
waistbelt
it
is
pretty
certain
that
lillie
even
felt
more
interest
in
captain
colburne
than
in
the
vanished
hebrews
it
will
be
remembered
that
she
has
never
ceased
to
like
him
since
she
met
him
more
than
three
years
ago
in
this
same
new
boston
house
which
is
now
in
some
faint
degree
fragrant
to
her
with
his
memory
here
commenced
that
loyal
affection
which
has
followed
her
through
her
love
for
another
her
marriage
and
her
maternity
and
which
has
risked
life
to
save
her
from
captivity
she
would
be
ungrateful
if
she
did
not
prefer
him
in
her
heart
to
every
other
human
being
except
her
father
and
ravvie
next
to
her
intercourse
with
this
same
parent
and
child
colburne
letters
were
her
chief
social
pleasures
they
were
invariably
directed
to
the
doctor
but
if
she
got
at
them
first
she
had
no
hesitation
about
opening
them
it
was
her
business
and
pleasure
also
to
file
them
for
preservation
if
he
never
returns
she
said
i
will
write
his
life
but
how
horrible
to
hear
of
him
killed
in
five
months
more
his
three
years
will
be
up
observed
the
doctor
i
hope
that
he
will
be
protected
through
the
perils
that
remain
i
hope
so
echoed
lillie
i
wonder
if
the
war
will
last
long
enough
to
need
ravvie
he
shall
never
go
to
west
point
he
is
pretty
certain
not
to
go
for
the
next
fourteen
years
said
ravenel
smiling
at
this
long
look
ahead
lillie
sighed
she
was
thinking
of
her
husband
it
was
west
point
which
had
ruined
his
noble
character
nothing
else
could
account
for
such
a
downfall
and
her
child
should
not
go
there
in
july
they
heard
that
the
nineteenth
corps
had
been
transferred
to
virginia
and
during
the
autumn
colburne
letters
described
sheridan
brilliant
victories
in
the
shenandoah
valley
the
captain
was
present
in
the
three
pitched
battles
and
got
an
honorable
mention
for
gallantry
but
no
promotion
indeed
advancement
was
impossible
without
a
transfer
for
although
his
regiment
had
only
two
it
was
now
too
much
reduced
in
numbers
to
be
entitled
to
a
colonel
more
than
of
the
rank
and
file
and
more
than
of
the
officers
had
fallen
in
those
three
savage
struggles
nevertheless
the
young
man
letters
were
unflagging
in
their
tone
of
elation
bragging
of
the
bravery
of
his
regiment
describing
bayonet
charges
through
whistling
storms
of
hostile
musketry
telling
of
captured
flags
and
cannon
by
the
half
hundred
affectionate
over
his
veteran
corps
commander
and
enthusiastic
over
his
youthful
general
in
chief
really
that
is
a
most
brilliant
letter
observed
ravenel
after
listening
to
colburne
account
of
the
victory
of
cedar
creek
that
is
the
most
splendid
that
ever
was
produced
by
any
author
ancient
or
modern
he
went
on
to
say
in
his
enthusiastic
and
somewhat
hyperbolical
style
neither
tacitus
nor
napier
can
equal
it
alison
is
all
fudge
and
claptrap
with
his
granite
squares
of
infantry
and
his
billows
of
cavalry
one
can
understand
colburne
i
know
just
how
that
battle
of
cedar
creek
was
fought
and
i
almost
think
that
i
could
fight
such
an
one
myself
there
is
cause
and
effect
and
their
relations
to
each
other
in
his
narrative
when
he
comes
home
i
shall
insist
upon
his
writing
a
history
of
this
war
i
wish
he
would
said
lillie
with
a
flash
of
interest
for
which
she
blushed
presently
chapter
xxxiv
lillie
attention
is
recalled
to
the
rising
generation
on
or
about
the
first
of
january
lillie
chanced
to
go
out
on
a
shopping
excursion
and
descended
the
stairway
of
the
hotel
just
in
time
to
catch
sight
of
a
newly
arrived
guest
who
was
about
entering
his
room
on
the
first
story
one
servant
directed
the
unsteady
step
and
supported
the
wavering
form
of
the
stranger
while
another
carried
a
painted
wooden
box
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
square
which
seemed
to
be
his
sole
baggage
as
lillie
was
in
the
broad
light
and
the
invalid
was
walking
from
her
down
a
dark
passage
she
could
not
see
how
thin
and
yellow
his
face
was
nor
how
threadbare
and
even
ragged
was
his
fatigue
uniform
but
she
could
distinguish
the
dark
blue
cloth
and
gilt
buttons
which
her
eye
never
encountered
now
without
a
sparkle
of
interest
she
had
reached
the
street
before
the
question
occurred
to
her
could
it
be
captain
colburne
she
reasoned
that
it
could
not
be
for
he
had
written
to
them
only
a
fortnight
ago
without
mentioning
either
sickness
or
wounds
and
the
time
of
his
regiment
would
not
be
up
for
ten
days
yet
nevertheless
she
made
her
shopping
tour
a
short
one
for
thinking
of
that
sick
officer
and
on
returning
to
the
hotel
she
looked
at
the
regardless
of
the
students
who
lounged
against
the
office
counter
there
written
in
the
clerk
hand
was
capt
colburne
no
as
she
went
up
stairs
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
passing
no
and
was
nearly
overcome
by
a
sudden
impulse
to
knock
at
the
door
she
wanted
to
see
her
best
friend
and
to
know
if
he
were
really
sick
and
how
sick
and
whether
she
could
do
anything
for
him
she
determined
to
send
a
servant
to
make
instant
inquiries
but
on
reaching
her
room
she
found
her
father
playing
with
ravvie
papa
captain
colburne
is
here
were
her
first
words
is
it
possible
exclaimed
the
doctor
leaping
up
with
delight
have
you
seen
him
not
to
speak
with
him
i
am
afraid
he
is
sick
he
was
leaning
on
the
porter
arm
he
is
in
number
eighteen
do
go
and
ask
how
he
is
i
will
you
are
certain
that
it
is
our
captain
colburne
it
must
be
answered
lillie
as
he
went
out
and
then
thought
with
a
blush
will
papa
laugh
at
me
if
i
am
mistaken
when
ravenel
rapped
at
the
door
of
no
a
deep
but
rather
hoarse
voice
answered
come
in
my
dear
friend
exclaimed
the
doctor
rushing
into
the
room
but
the
moment
that
he
saw
the
captain
he
stopped
in
surprise
and
dismay
do
get
up
he
said
do
stir
bless
me
how
long
have
you
been
in
this
way
only
a
little
while
a
month
or
two
answered
colburne
with
his
customary
cheerful
smile
soon
be
all
right
again
sit
down
he
was
stretched
at
full
length
on
his
bed
evidently
quite
feeble
his
eyes
underscored
with
lines
of
blueish
yellow
his
face
sallow
and
features
sharpened
the
eyes
themselves
were
heavy
and
dull
with
the
effects
of
the
opium
which
he
had
taken
to
enable
him
to
undergo
the
day
journey
besides
his
long
brown
mustache
which
had
become
ragged
with
want
of
care
he
had
on
a
beard
of
three
weeks
growth
and
his
face
and
hands
were
stained
with
the
dust
and
smirch
of
two
continuous
railroad
travel
which
he
had
not
yet
had
time
to
wash
away
in
fact
as
soon
as
he
had
reached
his
room
he
had
thrown
himself
on
the
bed
and
fallen
asleep
his
only
clothing
was
a
summer
blouse
of
dark
blue
flannel
a
common
soldier
shirt
of
knit
woolen
government
trousers
of
coarse
cloth
without
a
welt
and
brown
government
stockings
worn
through
at
toe
and
heel
on
the
floor
lay
his
shoes
rough
brogans
likewise
of
government
issue
all
of
his
clothing
was
ineradically
stained
with
the
famous
mud
of
virginia
his
blouse
was
threadbare
where
the
went
and
had
a
ragged
through
the
collar
altogether
he
presented
the
spectacle
of
a
man
pretty
thoroughly
worn
out
in
field
service
is
that
all
you
wear
in
this
season
demanded
or
rather
exclaimed
the
doctor
you
will
kill
yourself
colburne
answering
laugh
was
so
feeble
that
its
cheerfulness
sounded
like
mockery
there
is
a
chance
of
killing
me
he
said
i
am
not
cold
on
the
contrary
i
am
suffering
with
the
heat
of
these
fires
and
close
rooms
it
rather
odd
considering
how
run
down
i
am
but
actually
i
have
been
quarreling
all
the
way
home
to
keep
my
window
in
the
car
open
i
was
so
stifled
for
want
of
air
three
years
spent
out
of
doors
makes
a
house
seem
like
a
black
hole
of
calcutta
but
no
vest
urged
the
doctor
it
enough
to
guarantee
you
an
inflammation
of
the
lungs
i
seen
my
vest
nor
any
part
of
my
full
uniform
for
six
months
said
colburne
much
amused
you
do
know
till
you
try
it
how
hardy
a
soldier
can
be
even
when
he
is
sick
my
only
until
about
the
first
of
november
was
a
rubber
blanket
i
will
tell
you
when
we
left
louisiana
in
july
we
thought
we
were
going
to
besiege
mobile
and
consequently
i
only
took
my
flannel
suit
and
rubber
blanket
it
was
enough
for
a
southern
summer
campaign
henry
had
all
he
could
do
to
tote
his
own
affairs
and
my
rations
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
disgust
with
which
he
looked
at
his
bundle
he
began
to
think
that
he
would
rather
be
respectable
and
industrious
and
learn
to
read
than
carry
such
a
load
as
that
his
only
consolation
was
that
he
would
soon
steal
a
horse
well
i
seen
my
trunk
since
i
left
it
on
store
in
new
orleans
and
i
do
know
where
it
is
though
i
suppose
it
may
be
in
washington
with
the
rest
of
the
baggage
of
our
division
i
tell
you
this
has
been
a
glorious
campaign
this
one
in
the
shenandoah
but
it
has
been
a
teaser
for
privations
marching
and
as
well
as
fighting
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
ever
knocked
under
to
hardships
by
day
and
by
night
i
do
think
that
even
this
would
have
laid
me
out
however
if
i
had
been
poisoned
by
the
louisiana
swamps
malarious
fever
is
what
bothers
me
you
will
have
to
be
very
careful
of
yourself
said
the
doctor
he
noticed
a
febrile
agitation
in
the
look
and
even
in
the
conversation
of
the
wasted
young
hero
which
alarmed
him
oh
no
smiled
colburne
i
will
be
all
right
in
a
week
or
two
all
i
want
is
rest
i
will
be
about
in
less
than
a
week
i
can
travel
now
you
do
realize
how
a
soldier
can
pick
himself
up
from
an
ordinary
illness
is
it
curious
how
the
poor
fellows
will
be
around
on
their
pins
and
in
their
clothes
till
they
die
i
think
i
am
rather
effeminate
in
taking
off
my
shoes
i
only
did
it
out
of
compliment
to
the
white
coverlet
does
it
look
reproachfully
clean
compared
with
me
i
am
positively
ashamed
of
my
filthiness
although
i
did
suspect
it
until
i
got
into
the
confines
of
peaceful
civilization
i
assure
you
i
am
a
tolerably
tidy
man
for
our
corps
in
its
present
condition
i
am
a
very
respectable
average
we
are
all
ready
here
to
worship
your
very
rags
well
after
i
get
rid
of
them
i
must
have
a
citizen
suit
as
soon
as
possible
ca
you
telegraph
for
your
trunk
i
have
but
that
of
no
consequence
no
more
uniform
for
me
i
am
home
to
be
mustered
out
of
service
i
ca
stay
any
longer
you
understand
i
am
one
of
the
original
officers
and
have
never
been
promoted
and
so
go
out
with
the
original
organization
if
we
could
have
eighteen
men
more
we
should
have
been
a
full
veteran
regiment
and
i
could
have
staid
i
came
home
before
the
organization
i
was
on
detached
duty
as
and
so
got
a
leave
of
absence
you
see
i
wanted
to
be
here
as
early
as
possible
in
order
to
make
out
my
men
account
and
rolls
i
have
a
horrible
amount
of
work
to
do
this
week
work
exclaimed
ravenel
you
are
no
more
fit
to
work
than
you
are
to
fly
you
ca
work
and
you
but
i
must
i
am
responsible
if
i
do
do
this
job
i
may
be
dismissed
the
service
instead
of
being
mustered
out
honorably
do
you
think
i
an
going
to
let
myself
be
disgraced
sooner
die
in
harness
but
my
dear
friend
you
ca
do
it
your
very
talk
is
feverish
you
are
on
the
edge
of
delirium
oh
no
i
ca
help
laughing
at
you
you
do
know
how
much
a
sick
man
can
do
if
he
must
he
can
march
and
fight
a
battle
i
have
done
it
weaker
than
this
thank
god
i
have
my
company
papers
they
are
in
that
box
all
my
baggage
all
i
want
i
can
make
my
first
roll
and
hire
somebody
to
do
the
four
copies
you
see
it
must
be
done
for
my
men
sake
as
well
as
mine
by
jove
we
get
horrible
hard
measure
in
field
service
i
have
gone
almost
mad
about
that
box
during
the
past
six
months
wanted
it
every
day
and
could
have
it
for
lack
of
transportation
the
war
department
demanding
returns
and
hospitals
demanding
descriptive
lists
of
wounded
men
one
threatening
to
stop
my
pay
and
another
to
report
me
to
the
and
i
make
out
a
paper
for
lack
of
that
box
if
i
had
only
known
that
we
were
coming
to
virginia
i
could
have
prepared
myself
you
see
i
could
have
made
out
a
of
my
company
accounts
to
carry
in
my
pocket
but
how
did
i
know
he
spoke
as
rapidly
and
eagerly
as
if
he
were
pleading
his
case
before
the
and
showing
cause
why
he
should
not
be
dishonorably
dismissed
the
service
after
a
moment
of
gloomy
reflection
he
spoke
again
still
harping
on
this
worrying
subject
i
have
six
months
unfinished
business
to
write
up
or
i
am
a
disgraced
man
the
commissary
of
musters
will
report
me
to
the
and
the
will
dismiss
me
from
the
service
it
pretty
justice
is
it
but
if
you
are
a
and
on
detached
service
that
does
matter
the
moment
the
day
comes
i
am
commandant
of
company
and
responsible
for
company
papers
i
ought
to
go
to
work
but
i
ca
i
am
horribly
tired
i
may
try
this
evening
no
no
my
dear
friend
implored
the
doctor
you
must
talk
in
this
way
you
will
make
yourself
sick
you
sick
do
you
know
that
you
are
almost
delirious
on
this
subject
am
i
well
let
drop
it
by
the
way
how
are
you
and
how
is
carter
upon
my
honor

have
been
shamefully
selfish
in
talking
so
much
about
my
affairs
how
is
carter
and
the
little
boy
very
well
both
of
them
my
daughter

be
glad
to

must
go
out

i
want
some
clothes
i
ca

out
in
these
filthy
rags

am
loaded
and
disreputable
with
the
sacred
southern
soil
if
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
ring
the
bell
i
will
send
for
a
tailor
i
must
be
measured
for
a
citizen

my
dear
fellow

to
bed
i
will
order
a
for
you
if

do
know
the
strength
of
my
constitution
said
colburne
with
his
haggard
feverish
confident
smile
upon
my
soul
you
look
like
it
exclaimed
the
doctor
out
of
patience
well
what
will
you
have
for
dinner
of
course
you
are
not
going
down
not
in
these
tatters
no
why
i
think
i
should
like
let
me
see
some
good
oysters
and
mince
pie
the
doctor
laughed
aloud
and
then
threw
up
his
hands
desperately
i
thought
so
stark
mad
i
order
your
dinner
myself
sir
you
shall
have
some
farina
just
as
you
say
i
do
care
much
i
do
want
anything
but
it
a
long
while
since
i
have
had
a
piece
of
mince
pie
and
it
ca
be
as
bad
a
diet
as
raw
pork
and
green
apples
i
do
know
answered
the
doctor
now
then
will
you
promise
to
take
a
bath
and
go
regularly
to
bed
as
soon
as
i
leave
you
i
will
how
you
bully
a
fellow
i
tell
you
i
not
sick
to
speak
of
i
only
a
little
worried
when
ravenel
returned
to
his
own
apartment
he
found
lillie
waiting
to
go
down
to
dinner
how
is
he
she
asked
the
moment
he
opened
the
door
very
badly
very
feverish
hardly
in
his
right
mind
oh
no
papa
remonstrated
lillie
you
always
exaggerate
such
things
now
he
is
very
bad
is
he
is
he
as
sick
as
he
was
at
donnelsonville
you
know
how
fast
he
got
well
then
i
do
believe
he
is
in
any
danger
is
he
she
took
a
strong
interest
in
him
it
was
her
way
to
take
an
interest
and
to
show
it
she
had
much
of
what
the
french
call
expansion
and
very
little
of
whether
in
feeling
or
speech
i
tell
you
my
dear
that
i
am
exceedingly
anxious
he
is
almost
prostrated
by
weakness
and
there
is
a
febrile
excitement
which
is
weakening
him
still
more
no
immediate
danger
you
understand
but
the
case
is
certainly
a
very
delicate
and
uncertain
one
so
many
of
these
noble
fellows
die
after
they
get
home
i
would
be
so
anxious
only
that
he
thinks
he
has
a
vast
quantity
of
company
business
on
hand
which
must
be
attended
to
at
once
ca
we
do
it
or
some
of
it
for
him
perhaps
so
i
dare
say
yes
i
think
it
likely
but
now
let
us
hurry
down
i
want
to
order
something
suitable
for
his
dinner
i
must
buy
a
dose
of
morphine
too
that
will
make
him
sleep
till
morning
he
sleep
or
he
wo
live
oh
papa
i
hope
you
did
talk
that
way
to
you
are
enough
to
frighten
patients
into
the
other
world
you
are
always
so
anxious
about
them
not
much
danger
of
frightening
him
groaned
the
doctor
i
wish
he
could
be
scared
just
a
little
just
enough
to
keep
him
quiet
after
dinner
the
doctor
saw
colburne
again
he
had
bathed
had
gone
to
bed
and
had
an
opiated
doze
but
was
still
in
his
state
of
fevered
nervousness
and
showed
it
unconsciously
to
himself
in
his
conversation
just
now
his
mind
was
running
on
the
subject
of
gazaway
probably
in
connection
with
his
own
lack
of
promotion
and
he
talked
with
a
bitterness
of
comment
and
an
irritation
of
feeling
which
were
very
unusual
with
him
you
know
the
secret
history
of
his
rehabilitation
said
he
well
there
is
one
consolation
in
the
miserable
affair
he
fooled
our
sly
governor
you
know
it
was
agreed
that
after
gazaway
had
been
whitewashed
with
a
he
should
show
his
gratitude
by
carrying
his
district
for
our
party
and
then
resign
to
make
way
for
the
governor
nephew
major
rathbun
but
it
seems
gazaway
had
his
own
ideas
he
knew
a
trick
or
two
besides
saving
his
bacon
on
the
his
plan
was
that
he
should
be
the
candidate
for
congress
from
the
district
when
he
found
that
he
could
make
that
work
he
did
the
next
best
thing
and
held
on
to
his
commission
was
it
capital
it
pays
me
for
being
overlooked
during
three
years
in
spite
of
the
recommendations
of
my
colonel
and
my
generals
there
he
is
still
with
the
governor
nephew
under
him
to
do
his
fighting
and
field
duty
i
do
know
how
gazaway
got
command
of
the
conscript
camp
where
he
has
been
for
the
last
year
i
suppose
he
lobbied
for
it
but
i
know
that
he
has
turned
it
to
good
account
one
of
my
sergeants
was
on
detached
duty
at
the
camp
and
was
taken
behind
the
scenes
he
told
me
that
he
made
two
hundred
dollars
in
less
than
a
month
and
that
gazaway
must
have
pocketed
ten
times
as
much
how
is
it
possible
that
they
have
not
ferreted
out
such
a
scoundrel
exclaims
the
doctor
ah
the
war
department
has
had
a
great
load
to
carry
the
war
department
has
had
its
hands
too
full
of
jeff
davis
to
attend
to
every
smaller
rascal
but
why
did
major
rathbun
have
him
tried
for
his
old
offences
it
was
the
major
interest
to
get
him
out
of
his
own
way
those
were
condoned
by
the
acceptance
of
his
resignation
gazaway
died
officially
with
full
absolution
and
then
was
born
again
in
his
reappointment
he
could
go
to
work
with
clean
hands
to
let
substitutes
escape
for
five
hundred
dollars
while
the
sergeant
who
allowed
the
man
to
dodge
him
got
fifty
is
it
a
beautiful
story
shocking
but
this
is
doing
you
harm
you
do
need
talk
you
need
sleep
i
have
brought
you
a
dose
to
make
you
hold
your
tongue
till
morning
oh
opium
i
have
been
living
on
it
for
the
last
hours
the
last
week
twelve
more
hours
wo
hurt
you
you
must
stop
thinking
and
feeling
i
tell
you
honestly
that
i
never
saw
you
in
such
a
feverish
state
of
excitation
when
you
were
wounded
you
talk
in
a
manner
quite
unlike
yourself
very
well
said
colburne
with
a
sigh
as
if
resigning
himself
by
an
effort
to
the
repugnant
idea
of
repose
here
we
may
as
well
turn
off
gazaway
since
he
will
not
be
executed
by
any
act
of
civil
or
military
justice
removed
at
last
from
the
conscript
camp
and
ordered
to
the
front
he
at
once
sent
in
his
resignation
backed
up
by
a
surgeon
certificate
of
physical
disability
retired
from
the
service
with
a
capital
of
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
dollars
removed
to
new
york
set
up
a
turned
democrat
once
more
obtained
a
couple
of
city
offices
and
now
has
an
income
of
seven
or
eight
thousand
a
circle
of
admiring
henchmen
and
a
reputation
for
ability
in
business
and
politics
when
he
speaks
in
a
ward
meeting
or
in
a
squad
of
speculators
on
his
words
have
ten
times
the
influence
that
would
be
accorded
in
the
same
places
to
the
utterances
of
colburne
or
ravenel
i
however
prefer
to
write
the
history
of
these
two
gentlemen
who
appear
so
unsuccessful
when
seen
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
fearing
to
disturb
colburne
slumbers
ravenel
did
not
visit
him
again
until
nine
on
the
following
morning
he
found
him
dressed
and
looking
over
a
mass
of
company
records
preparatory
to
commencing
his
roll
you
ought
not
to
do
that
said
the
doctor
you
are
very
feverish
and
weak
all
the
strength
you
have
is
from
opiates
and
you
tax
your
brain
fearfully
by
driving
it
on
such
fuel
but
it
must
be
done
doctor
he
said
with
a
scowl
as
if
trying
to
see
clearly
through
clouds
of
fever
and
morphine
it
is
an
awful
job
he
added
with
a
sigh
just
see
what
it
is
i
must
have
the
name
of
every
officer
and
man
that
ever
belonged
to
the
company
where
when
and
by
whom
enlisted
where
when
and
by
whom
mustered
in
when
and
by
whom
last
paid
what
bounty
paid
and
what
bounty
due
balance
of

number
and
date

important
order
five
copies
why
do
they
demand
five
hundred
upon
my
soul
it
does
seem
as
if
i
could
do
it
why
not
make
some
of
your
men
do
it
i
have
none
here
i
am
the
only
man
who
will
go
out
on
this
paper
there
is
not
a
man
of
my
original
company
who
has
not
either
as
a
veteran
or
deserted
or
died
or
been
killed
or
been
discharged
because
of
wounds
or
breaking
down
under
hardships
astonishing
very
curious
that
shenandoah
campaign
cut
up
our
regiment
wonderfully
we
went
there
with
four
hundred
men
and
we
had
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
when
i
left
the
civilian
stared
at
the
coolness
of
the
soldier
which
seemed
to
him
much
like
the
latter
rubbed
his
forehead
and
eyes
not
affected
by
these
tremendous
recollections
but
simply
seeking
to
gain
clearness
of
brain
enough
to
commence
his
talk
you
must
not
work
said
the
doctor
i
have
only
three
days
for
the
job
and
i
work
well
go
on
then
make
your
original
which
is
i
suppose
the
great
difficulty
and
my
daughter
and
i
will
make
the
four
others
will
you
how
kind
you
are
at
nine
of
the
following
morning
colburne
delivered
to
ravenel
the
original
roll
during
that
day
and
the
next
the
father
and
daughter
finished
the
four
copies
while
colburne
lay
in
bed
too
sick
and
dizzy
to
raise
his
head
on
the
fourth
day
he
went
by
railroad
to
the
city
of
the
primary
rendezvous
of
the
regiment
and
was
duly
mustered
out
of
existence
as
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
returning
to
new
boston
that
evening
he
fainted
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
was
carried
to
his
room
by
the
porters
and
did
not
leave
his
bed
for
hours
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
dressed
himself
in
his
citizen
suit
and
called
on
carter
she
was
astonished
and
frightened
to
see
him
for
he
was
alarmingly
thin
and
ghastly
nevertheless
after
the
first
startled
exclamation
of
captain
colburne
she
added
with
a
benevolent
hypocrisy
how
much
better
you
look
than
i
thought
to
see
you
he
held
both
her
hands
for
a
moment
gazing
into
her
eyes
with
a
profound
gratification
at
their
sympathy
and
then
said
as
he
seated
himself
thank
you
for
your
anxiety
i
am
going
to
get
well
now
i
am
going
to
give
myself
three
months
of
pure
perfect
rest
the
wearied
man
pronounced
the
word
with
a
touching
intonation
of
pleasure
do
call
me
captain
he
resumed
the
very
word
tires
me
and
i
want
repose
besides
i
am
a
citizen
and
have
a
right
to
the
mister
he
is
mortified
because
he
was
not
promoted
thought
lillie
and
called
him
by
the
threadbare
title
no
more
it
always
seems
to
be
our
business
to
take
care
of
you
when
you
are
sick
she
said
we
nursed
you
at
taylorsville
that
is
till
we
wanted
some
fighting
done
that
seems
a
great
while
ago
replied
colburne
meditatively
how
many
things
have
happened
since
then
he
was
about
to
say
but
checked
the
utterance
for
fear
of
giving
her
pain
yes
it
seems
a
long
time
ago
she
repeated
soberly
for
she
too
thought
how
many
things
had
happened
since
then
and
thought
it
with
more
emotion
than
he
could
give
to
the
idea
he
continued
to
gaze
at
her
earnestly
and
with
profound
pity
in
his
heart
while
his
memory
flashed
over
the
two
great
incidents
of
maternity
and
widowhood
she
has
fought
harder
battles
than
i
have
he
said
to
himself
wondering
meanwhile
to
find
her
so
little
changed
and
deciding
that
what
change
there
was
only
made
her
more
charming
he
longed
to
say
some
word
of
consolation
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
but
he
would
not
speak
of
the
subject
until
she
introduced
it
lillie
mind
also
wondered
shudderingly
around
that
bereavement
and
then
dashed
desperately
away
from
it
without
uttering
a
plaint
can
i
see
the
baby
he
asked
after
these
few
moments
of
silence
she
colored
deeply
not
so
much
with
pleasure
and
pride
as
with
a
return
of
the
old
virginity
of
soul
he
understood
it
for
he
remembered
that
she
had
blushed
in
the
same
manner
when
she
met
him
for
the
first
time
after
her
marriage
it
was
the
modesty
of
her
womanhood
confessing
i
am
not
what
i
was
when
you
saw
me
last
he
is
not
a
baby
she
laughed
he
is
a
great
boy
more
than
a
year
old
come
and
look
at
him
she
led
the
way
into
her
room
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
been
in
her
room
and
the
place
filled
him
with
delicious
awe
as
if
he
were
in
the
presence
of
some
sweet
sanctity
irish
rosann
sitting
by
the
bedside
and
reading
her
raised
her
old
head
and
took
a
keen
survey
of
the
stranger
through
her
spectacles
on
the
bed
lay
a
chubby
urchin
well
grown
for
a
yearling
his
fair
face
red
with
health
sunburn
and
sleep
arms
spread
wide
apart
and
one
dimpled
leg
and
foot
outside
of
the
coverlet
there
is
the
little
doctor
she
said
bending
down
and
kissing
a
dimple
it
was
a
long
time
since
she
had
called
him
little
general
or
little
brigadier
from
the
worship
of
the
husband
she
had
gone
back
in
a
great
measure
perhaps
altogether
to
the
earlier
and
happier
worship
of
the
parent
does
he
look
like
his
grandfather
asked
colburne
why
ca
you
see
it
he
is
wonderfully
like
him
he
has
blue
eyes
too
do
you
see
the
resemblance
i
think
he
has
more
chins
than
your
father
he
has
double
chins
all
the
way
down
to
his
toes
said
colburne
pointing
to
the
collops
on
the
little
leg
you
must
laugh
at
him
she
answered
i
suppose
you
have
seen
him
enough
men
seldom
take
a
longer
look
than
that
at
a
baby
yes
i
do
want
to
wake
him
up
i
do
want
the
responsibility
of
it
i
would
assume
the
responsibilities
of
an
ant
i
have
the
energy
for
it
they
returned
to
the
little
parlor
the
doctor
came
in
and
immediately
forced
the
invalid
to
lie
on
a
sofa
propping
him
up
with
pillows
and
proposing
to
cover
him
with
an
affghan
no
said
colburne
i
beg
pardon
for
my
obstinacy
but
i
suffer
with
heat
all
the
time
it
is
the
fever
said
the
doctor
remittent
malarious
fever
it
is
no
joke
when
it
dates
from
brashear
city
it
is
not
being
used
to
a
house
answered
colburne
stubborn
in
faith
in
his
own
health
it
is
wearing
a
vest
and
a
broadcloth
coat
i
really
am
not
strong
enough
to
bear
the
hardships
of
civilization
we
shall
see
said
the
doctor
gravely
the
indians
die
of
civilization
so
does
many
a
returned
soldier
you
will
have
to
be
careful
of
yourself
for
a
long
time
to
come
i
am
said
colburne
i
sleep
with
windows
open
why
did
you
write
to
us
that
you
were
sick
asked
lillie
i
did
wish
to
worry
you
i
knew
you
were
kind
enough
to
be
worried
what
was
the
use
she
thought
that
it
was
noble
and
just
like
him
but
she
said
nothing
she
could
not
help
admiring
him
as
he
lay
there
for
looking
so
sick
and
weak
and
yet
so
cheerful
and
courageous
so
absolutely
indifferent
to
his
state
of
bodily
depression
there
was
not
in
his
face
or
manner
a
single
shadow
of
expression
which
seemed
like
an
appeal
for
pity
or
sympathy
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
had
become
so
accustomed
to
suffering
as
to
consider
it
a
matter
not
worthy
of
a
moment
despondency
or
even
consideration
his
look
was
noticeably
resolute
and
energetic
yet
patient
you
are
the
most
resigned
sick
man
that
i
ever
saw
she
said
you
make
as
good
an
invalid
as
a
woman
a
soldier
life
cultivates
some
of
the
christian
virtues
he
answered
especially
resignation
and
obedience
just
see
here
you
are
roused
at
midnight
march
twenty
miles
on
end
halt
three
or
four
hours
perhaps
in
a
pelting
rain
then
you
are
faced
about
marched
back
to
your
old
quarters
and
dismissed
and
nobody
ever
tells
you
why
or
wherefore
you
take
it
very
hard
at
first
but
at
last
you
get
used
to
it
and
do
just
as
you
are
bid
without
complaint
or
comment
you
no
more
pretend
to
reason
concerning
your
duties
than
a
millstone
troubles
itself
to
understand
the
cause
of
its
revolutions
you
are
set
in
motion
and
you
move
think
of
being
started
out
at
early
dawn
and
made
to
stand
to
arms
till
daylight
every
morning
for
six
weeks
running
you
may
grumble
at
it
but
you
do
it
all
the
same
at
last
you
forget
to
grumble
and
even
to
ask
the
reason
why
you
obey
because
you
are
ordered
oh
a
man
learns
a
vast
deal
of
stoical
virtue
in
field
service
he
learns
courage
too
against
sickness
as
well
as
against
bullets
i
believe
the
war
will
give
a
manlier
nobler
tone
to
the
character
of
our
nation
the
school
of
suffering
teaches
grand
lessons
and
how
will
the
war
end
asked
lillie
anxious
as
every
citizen
was
to
get
the
opinion
of
a
soldier
on
this
great
question
we
shall
beat
them
of
course
when
i
ca
say
nobody
can
i
never
heard
a
military
man
of
any
merit
pretend
to
fix
the
time
now
that
i
am
a
civilian
perhaps
i
shall
resume
the
gift
of
prophecy
seward
keeps
saying
in
three
months
well
if
he
keeps
saying
so
long
enough
he
will
hit
it
seward
has
been
serious
in
such
talk
his
only
object
was
to
cheer
up
the
nation
so
we
shall
beat
them
cheerfully
repeated
the
converted
secessionist
and
what
then
i
hope
we
shall
pitch
into
england
i
hate
her
for
being
so
underhandedly
spiteful
toward
the
north
and
false
toward
the
south
oh
no
do
hate
her
england
like
every
body
else
does
like
a
great
neighbor
and
would
be
pleased
to
see
him
break
up
into
small
neighbors
but
england
is
a
grand
old
nation
and
one
of
the
lights
of
the
world
the
only
satisfaction
which
i
should
find
in
a
war
with
england
would
be
that
i
could
satisfy
my
curiosity
on
a
point
of
professional
interest
i
would
like
to
see
how
european
troops
fight
compared
with
ours
i
would
cheerfully
risk
a
battle
for
the
spectacle
and
which
do
you
think
would
beat
asked
lillie
i
really
do
know
that
is
just
the
question
marengo
against
cedar
creek
leipsic
against
the
wilderness
i
should
like
of
all
things
in
the
world
to
see
the
trial
thus
they
talked
for
a
couple
of
hours
in
a
quiet
way
strolling
over
many
subjects
but
discussing
nothing
of
deep
personal
interest
colburne
was
too
weak
to
have
much
desire
to
feel
or
to
excite
emotions
in
studying
the
young
woman
before
him
he
was
chiefly
occupied
in
detecting
and
measuring
the
exact
change
which
the
potent
incidents
of
her
later
life
had
wrought
in
her
expression
he
decided
that
she
looked
more
serious
and
more
earnest
than
of
old
but
that
was
the
total
of
his
fancied
discoveries
in
fact
he
was
too
languid
to
analyze
chapter
xxxv
captain
colburne
as
colburne
during
three
months
colburne
rested
from
marches
battles
fatigues
emotions
he
was
temporarily
so
worn
out
in
body
and
mind
that
he
could
not
even
rally
vigor
enough
to
take
an
interest
in
any
but
the
greatest
of
the
majestic
passing
events
it
is
to
be
considered
that
he
had
been
by
war
to
all
ordinary
agitations
that
exposure
to
cannon
and
musketry
had
so
calloused
him
as
that
he
could
read
newspapers
with
tranquillity
accordingly
he
troubled
himself
very
little
about
the
world
and
it
got
along
at
an
amazing
rate
without
his
assistance
there
were
no
more
marengos
in
the
shenandoah
valley
but
there
was
a
waterloo
near
petersburg
and
an
ulm
near
raleigh
and
an
assassination
of
a
greater
than
william
of
orange
at
washington
and
over
all
a
grand
triumphant
republic
as
to
the
battles
colburne
only
read
the
editorial
summaries
and
official
reports
and
did
not
seem
to
care
much
for
our
own
correspondent
picturesque
particulars
give
him
the
positions
the
dispositions
the
leaders
the
general
results
and
he
knew
how
to
infer
the
minuti√¶
to
some
of
his
civilian
friends
the
brother
abolitionists
of
former
days
this
calmness
seemed
like
indifference
to
the
victories
of
his
country
and
such
was
the
eagerness
and
hotness
of
the
times
that
some
of
them
charged
him
with
want
of
patriotism
sympathy
with
the
rebels
copperheadism
etc
one
day
he
came
into
the
ravenel
parlor
with
a
smile
on
his
face
but
betraying
in
his
manner
something
of
the
irritability
of
weakness
and
latent
fever
i
have
heard
a
most
astonishing
thing
he
said
i
have
been
called
a
copperhead
i
who
fought
three
years
marched
the
skin
off
my
feet
have
been
wounded
starved
broken
down
in
field
service
am
a
copperhead
the
man
who
inferred
it
ought
to
know
he
has
lived
among
copperheads
for
the
last
three
years
he
has
never
been
in
the
army
never
smelled
a
pinch
of
rebel
powder
there
were
no
copperheads
at
the
front
they
were
all
here
at
the
rear
where
he
was
he
ought
to
know
them
and
he
says
that
i
am
one
of
them
is
it
amazing
how
did
he
discover
it
asked
the
doctor
we
were
talking
about
the
war
this
man
who
has
never
heard
a
bullet
whistle
please
remember
asserted
that
the
rebel
soldiers
were
cowards
and
asked
my
opinion
i
demurred
he
insisted
and
grew
warm
said
i
you
see
that
you
spoil
my
glory
here
i
have
been
in
the
field
three
years
finding
these
rebels
a
very
even
match
in
fighting
if
they
are
cowards
i
am
a
poltroon
the
inference
hurts
me
and
therefore
i
deny
the
premise
i
think
that
my
argument
aggravated
him
he
repeated
positively
that
the
rebels
were
cowards
and
that
whoever
asserted
the
contrary
was
a
southern
sympathiser
said
i
rebel
armies
differ
from
ours
chiefly
in
being
more
purely
american
is
it
the
greater
proportion
of
native
blood
which
causes
the
cowardice
thereupon
i
had
the
copperhead
brand
put
upon
my
forehead
and
was
excommunicated
from
the
paradise
of
loyalty
i
consider
it
rather
stunning
i
was
the
only
practical
abolitionist
in
the
company
the
only
man
who
had
freed
a
negro
or
caused
the
death
of
a
slaveholder
doctor
you
too
must
be
a
copperhead
you
have
suffered
a
good
deal
for
the
cause
of
freedom
and
country
but
i
do
believe
that
you
consider
the
rebel
armies
packs
of
cowards
the
doctor
noted
the
excitement
of
his
young
friend
and
observed
to
himself
remittent
malarious
fever
i
get
along
very
easily
with
these
earnest
people
he
added
aloud
they
say
more
than
they
strictly
believe
because
their
feelings
are
stronger
than
can
be
spoken
they
are
pretty
tart
but
they
are
mere
buttermilk
or
lemonade
compared
with
the
nitric
acid
which
i
used
to
find
in
louisiana
they
speak
hard
things
but
they
do
stick
you
under
the
fifth
rib
with
a
thanks
to
my
social
training
in
the
south
i
am
able
to
say
to
a
man
who
abuses
me
for
my
opinions
i
am
profoundly
grateful
to
you
for
not
cutting
my
throat
from
ear
to
ear
i
shall
never
forget
your
politeness
the
nervous
fretfulness
apparent
in
colburne
manner
on
this
occasion
passed
away
as
health
and
strength
returned
another
phenomenon
of
his
recovered
vigor
was
that
he
began
to
show
a
stronger
passion
for
the
society
of
carter
than
he
had
exhibited
when
he
first
returned
from
the
wars
on
his
well
days
he
made
a
span
with
young
whitewood
at
the
baby
wagon
only
it
was
observable
that
after
a
few
trials
they
came
to
a
tacit
understanding
to
take
turns
in
this
duty
so
that
when
one
was
there
the
other
kept
away
in
a
magnanimous
man
fashion
colburne
found
carter
in
the
main
a
much
more
serious
person
in
temper
than
when
he
bade
her
in
thibodeaux
the
interest
which
this
shadow
of
sadness
gave
her
in
his
eyes
or
perhaps
i
should
say
the
interest
with
which
she
invested
the
subject
of
sadness
in
his
mind
may
be
inferred
from
the
somewhat
wordy
fervor
of
the
following
passage
which
he
penned
about
this
time
in
his
book
dignity
of
grand
is
the
heart
which
is
ennobled
not
crushed
by
sorrow
by
mighty
sorrows
worn
not
as
manacles
but
as
a
crown
try
to
conceive
the
dignity
of
a
soul
which
has
suffered
deeply
and
borne
its
sufferings
well
as
compared
with
another
soul
which
has
not
suffered
at
all
remember
how
we
respect
a
veteran
a
mere
dead
mass
of
timber
ropes
and
iron
the
hartford
after
her
decks
have
run
with
blood
and
been
torn
by
shot
no
spectacle
of
new
frigates
just
from
the
stocks
moulded
in
the
latest
perfected
form
can
stir
our
souls
with
sympathy
like
the
sight
of
the
battered
hulk
truly
there
is
something
of
divinity
in
the
man
of
sorrows
acquainted
with
grief
even
when
his
body
is
but
human
provided
always
that
his
soul
has
grown
purer
by
its
trials
at
one
time
colburne
was
somewhat
anxious
about
carter
lest
her
character
should
become
permanently
sombre
in
consequence
of
lonely
brooding
over
her
troubles
he
remembered
with
pleasure
her
former
girlish
gayety
and
wished
that
it
might
be
again
her
prevailing
expression
do
you
think
you
see
people
enough
he
asked
her
i
mean
a
sufficient
variety
of
people
monotony
of
intellectual
diet
is
as
bad
for
the
spirit
as
monotony
of
physical
nourishment
for
the
body
i
am
sure
that
papa
and
whitewood
constitute
a
variety
she
answered
colburne
was
not
badly
pleased
with
this
speech
inasmuch
as
it
seemed
to
convey
a
slight
slur
upon
whitewood
he
was
so
gratified
in
fact
that
he
lost
sight
of
the
subject
of
the
conversation
until
she
recalled
him
to
it
do
you
think
i
am
getting
musty
she
inquired
of
course
not
but
there
is
danger
in
a
uniformity
of
spiritual
surroundings
danger
of
running
into
a
habit
of
reverie
brooding
melancholy
danger
of
growing
spiritually
old
i
know
it
but
what
can
a
woman
do
it
is
one
of
the
inconveniences
of
womanhood
that
we
ca
change
our
surroundings
not
even
our
hoops
at
our
own
pleasure
we
ca
run
out
into
the
world
and
say
amuse
us
there
are
two
worlds
for
the
two
sexes
a
man
consists
of
all
the
millions
of
earth
and
of
future
time
unless
he
becomes
a
captain
in
the
tenth
barataria
then
he
stays
where
he
began
a
woman
consists
of
the
people
whom
she
meets
daily
but
she
can
enlarge
it
she
can
make
it
comprehend
more
than
papa
and
mr
whitewood
but
not
more
than
ravvie
said
lillie
as
colburne
listened
to
this
declaration
he
felt
something
like
jealousy
of
the
baby
and
something
like
indignation
at
carter
what
business
had
she
to
let
herself
be
circumscribed
by
the
limits
of
such
a
diminutive
creature
this
was
not
the
only
time
that
lillie
shot
this
single
arrow
in
her
quiver
at
colburne
she
talked
a
great
deal
to
him
about
ravvie
believing
all
the
while
that
she
kept
a
strict
rein
upon
her
maternal
vanity
and
did
not
mention
the
boy
half
as
often
as
she
would
have
been
justified
in
doing
by
his
obesity
and
other
remarkable
characteristics
i
do
not
mean
to
intimate
that
the
subject
absolutely
and
acrimoniously
annoyed
our
hero
on
the
whole
her
maternal
fondness
was
a
pleasant
spectacle
to
him
especially
when
he
drew
the
inference
that
so
good
a
mother
would
be
sure
to
make
an
admirable
wife
moreover
his
passion
for
pets
easily
flowed
into
an
affection
for
this
infant
and
the
child
increased
the
feeling
by
his
grateful
response
to
the
young
bachelor
attentions
carter
blushed
more
than
once
to
see
her
baby
quit
her
and
toddle
across
the
room
and
greet
entrance
ravvie
come
here
she
would
say
you
trouble
people
no
no
protested
colburne
picking
up
the
little
man
and
setting
him
on
his
shoulder
i
like
to
be
troubled
by
people
who
love
me
then
after
a
slight
pause
he
added
audaciously
i
never
have
been
much
troubled
in
that
way
carter
blush
deepened
a
shade
or
two
at
this
observation
it
was
one
of
those
occasions
on
which
a
woman
always
says
something
as
as
possible
and
in
accordance
with
this
instinct
of
her
sex
she
spoke
of
the
russian
plague
which
was
then
a
subject
of
gossip
in
the
papers
i
am
so
afraid
ravvie
will
take
it
she
said
i
have
heard
that
there
is
a
case
next
door
and
i
am
really
tempted
to
run
away
with
him
for
a
week
or
two
i
would
replied
colburne
you
might
run
into
it
somewhere
else
one
case
is
not
alarming
if
i
had
forty
children
to
be
responsible
for
i
would
break
up
for
a
single
case
if
you
had
forty
you
might
be
so
frightened
as
if
you
had
only
one
remarked
carter
seriously
then
the
doctor
came
in
to
declare
in
his
cheerful
way
that
there
was
no
russian
plague
in
the
city
and
that
even
if
there
were
it
was
no
great
affair
of
a
disease
among
a
and
cleanly
population
we
are
more
in
danger
of
breaking
out
with
national
vanity
said
he
they
are
singing
anthems
choruses
p√¶ans
of
praise
to
us
across
the
water
all
the
nations
of
europe
are
welcoming
our
triumph
as
the
daughters
of
judea
went
out
with
cymbals
and
harps
to
greet
the
giant
killing
david
just
listen
to
this
here
he
unfolded
the
evening
post
of
the
day
took
off
his
put
on
his
spectacles
and
read
extracts
from
european
editorials
written
on
the
occasion
of
the
fall
of
richmond
and
surrender
of
lee
they
are
more
flattering
than
fourth
of
july
orations
said
colburne
i
feel
as
though
i
ought
to
go
straight
down
to
the
and
make
a
bow
across
the
atlantic
it
is
enough
to
make
a
spread
sprout
upon
every
loyal
american
i
am
not
sure
but
that
the
next
generation
will
be
furnished
with
the
article
as
being
absolutely
necessary
to
express
our
consciousness
of
admiration
on
the
darwinian
theory
you
know
circumstances
breed
species
the
europeans
seem
to
have
more
enthusiastic
views
of
us
than
we
do
of
ourselves
observed
lillie
i
never
thought
of
our
being
such
a
grand
nation
as
monsieur
laboulaye
paints
us
you
never
did
papa
i
never
had
occasion
to
till
now
said
the
doctor
as
long
as
we
were
bedraggled
in
slavery
there
was
not
much
room
for
honest
intelligent
pride
of
country
it
is
different
now
these
europeans
judge
us
aright
we
have
done
a
stupendous
thing
they
are
outside
of
the
struggle
and
can
survey
its
proportions
with
the
eyes
with
which
our
descendants
will
see
it
i
think
i
can
discover
a
little
of
its
grandeur
it
is
the
fifth
act
in
the
grand
drama
of
human
liberty
first
the
christian
revelation
second
the
protestant
reformation
third
the
war
of
american
independence
fourth
the
french
revolution
fifth
the
struggle
for
the
freedom
of
all
men
without
distinction
of
race
and
color
this
democratic
struggle
which
confirms
the
masses
in
an
equality
with
the
few
we
have
taught
a
greater
lesson
than
all
of
us
think
or
understand
once
again
we
have
reminded
the
world
of
democracy
the
futility
of
oligarchies
the
outlawry
of
c√¶sarism
in
the
long
run
the
right

the
north
living
by
free
industry
has
twenty
millions
of
people
and
wealth
inexhaustible
the
south
living
by
slavery
has
twelve
millions
one
half
of
whom
are
paupers
and
secret
enemies
the
right
always
conquers
because
it
always
becomes
the
strongest
in
that
sense
hand
of
god
is
identical
with
heaviest
battalions
another
thing
which
strikes
me
is
the
intensity
of
character
which
our
people
have
developed
we
are
no
longer
a
mere
collection
of
thirty
millions
of
bores
as
carlyle
called
us
there
never
was
greater
vigor
or
range
look
at
booth
the
new
judas
iscariot
look
at
blackburn
who
packed
up
yellow
fever
rags
with
the
hope
of
poisoning
a
continent
what
a
sweep
what
a
gamut
from
these
satanic
wretches
to
abraham
lincoln
a
purer
wiser
and
greater
than
socrates
whom
he
reminds
one
of
by
his
plain
sense
and
homely
humor

these
days
the
days
of
lincoln

and
sherman
faith
in
the

faith
in
the
supernatural
origin
of
humanity
becomes
possible
we
see
men
who
are
demoniacal
and
men
who
are
divine
i
can
now
go
back
to
my
childhood
and
read
plutarch
as
i
then
read
him
believing
that
wondrous
men
have
lived
because
i
see
that
they
do
live
i
can
now
understand
the
paradise
lost
for
i
have
beheld
heaven
fighting
with
hell
the
national
debt
will
be
awful
observes
lillie
after
the
brief
pause
which
naturally
follows
the
doctor
cynicism
three
thousand
millions
what
will
my
share
be
we
will
pay
it
off
says
the
doctor
in
a
series
of
operatic
entertainments
at
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
dress
seats
back
seats
fifty
thousand
the
southern
character
will
be
improved
by
the
struggle
observed
colburne
after
another
silence
they
will
be
sweetened
by
adversity
as
their
persimmons
are
by
frost
besides
it
is
such
a
calming
thing
to
have
one
fight
out
it
draws
off
the
bad
blood
but
what
are
we
to
do
about
punishing
the
masses
i
go
for
punishing
only
the
leaders
yes
coincided
the
doctor
they
are
the
responsible
criminals
it
is
astonishing
how
imperiously
strong
characters
govern
weak
ones
you
will
often
meet
with
a
man
who
absolutely
enters
into
and
possesses
other
men
making
them
talk
act
and
feel
as
if
they
were
himself
he
puts
them
on
and
wears
them
as
a
soldier
crab
puts
on
and
wears
an
empty
shell
for
instance
you
hear
a
man
talking
treason
you
look
at
him
and
say
is
that
poor
fool
cracker
but
all
the
while
it
is
planter
who
being
stronger
minded
than
cracker
dwells
in
him
and
blasphemes
out
of
his
windows
planter
is
the
living
crab
and
cracker
is
the
dead
shell
the
question
comes
up
shall
we
hang
and
which
shall
we
pardon
i
say
hang
planter
and
tell
cracker
to
get
to
work
planter
gone
some
better
man
will
occupy
cracker
and
make
him
speak
and
live
virtuously
but
strange
as
it
may
seem
unpatriotic
as
it
may
seem
there
was
a
subject
which
interested
colburne
more
than
these
great
matters
it
was
a
woman
a
widow
a
mother
who
as
he
supposed
still
mourned
her
dead
husband
and
only
loved
among
the
living
her
father
and
her
child
how
imperiously
for
wise
ends
we
are
governed
by
the
passion
of
sex
for
sex
in
spite
of
the
superficial
pleas
of
selfish
reason
and
interest
what
other
quality
physical
or
moral
have
we
that
could
take
the
place
of
this
beneficently
despotic
instinct
do
you
believe
that
conscience
sense
of
duty
philanthropy
would
induce
men
and
women
to
bear
with
each
other
to
bring
children
into
the
world
to
save
the
race
from
extinction
strike
out
the
affection
of
sex
for
sex
and
earth
would
be
first
a
hell
then
a
desert
god
is
not
very
far
from
every
one
of
us
the
nation
was
not
more
certainly
guided
by
the
hand
of
providence
in
overthrowing
slavery
than
was
this
man
in
loving
this
woman
i
do
not
suspect
that
any
one
of
these
reflections
entered
the
mind
of
colburne
although
he
was
intellectually
quite
capable
of
such
a
small
amount
of
philosophy
we
never
or
hardly
ever
think
of
applying
general
principles
to
our
own
cases
and
he
believed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
he
liked
carter
simply
because
she
was
individually
loveable
on
other
subjects
he
could
think
and
talk
with
perfect
rationality
he
could
even
discourse
transcendentally
to
her
concerning
her
own
heart
history
for
instance
one
day
when
she
was
sadder
than
usual
nervous
irritable
and
in
imperious
need
of
a
sympathising
confidant
she
alluded
shyly
to
her
sorrows
and
finding
him
willing
to
listen
added
frankly
oh
i
have
been
so
unhappy
it
is
rather
strange
that
he
did
not
seize
the
opportunity
and
say
let
me
be
your
consoler
but
he
too
was
in
a
temporarily
morbid
state
his
mind
unpractical
with
fever
and
weakness
wandering
helplessly
around
the
ideas
of
trouble
and
consolation
like
a
moth
around
the
bewilderment
of
a
candle
and
not
able
to
perceive
that
the
great
comforter
of
life
is
action
labor
duty
so
have
multitudes
he
answered
there
is
some
comfort
in
that
how
you
say
so
she
asked
turning
upon
him
in
astonishment
look
here
he
answered
there
are
ten
thousand
blossoms
on
an
apple
tree
but
not
five
hundred
of
them
mature
into
fruit
so
it
is
with
us
human
beings
a
few
succeed
the
rest
are
failures
it
is
a
part
of
the
method
of
god
he
creates
many
in
order
that
some
may
be
sure
to
reach
his
proposed
end
he
abounds
in
means
he
has
more
material
than
he
needs
he
minds
nothing
but
his
results
you
and
i
even
if
we
are
blighted
blooms
must
be
content
with
knowing
that
his
purposes
are
certain
to
be
fulfilled
if
we
fail
others
will
succeed
and
in
that
fact
we
can
rejoice
forgetting
ourselves
oh
but
that
is
very
hard
said
lillie
yes
it
is
but
what
right
have
we
to
demand
that
we
shall
be
happy
that
is
a
condition
that
we
have
no
right
and
no
power
to
make
with
the
creator
of
the
universe
our
desire
should
be
that
we
might
be
enabled
to
make
others
happy
i
wonder
that
this
should
seem
hard
doctrine
to
you
women
if
i
understand
them
are
full
of
and
live
through
multitudes
of
and
still
it
sounds
hard
persisted
lillie
i
could
not
bear
another
sacrifice
she
closed
her
eyes
under
an
impulse
of
spiritual
agony
as
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
yet
be
called
on
to
give
up
her
child
i
am
sorry
you
have
been
unhappy
he
said
much
moved
by
the
expression
of
her
face
at
this
moment
i
have
sympathised
with
you
oh
so
much
without
ever
saying
a
word
before
she
did
not
stop
him
from
taking
her
hand
and
for
a
few
moments
did
not
withdraw
it
from
his
grasp
far
deeper
than
the
philosophy
which
she
could
understand
but
not
feel
these
simple
and
words
just
such
as
any
child
might
utter
stole
into
her
heart
conveying
a
tearful
sense
of
comfort
and
eliciting
a
throb
of
gratitude
but
their
conversation
was
not
often
of
so
melancholy
and
sentimental
a
nature
she
had
more
gay
hours
with
this
old
friend
during
a
few
weeks
than
she
had
had
during
six
months
previous
to
his
arrival
she
often
laughed
when
the
tears
were
ready
to
start
but
gradually
the
spirit
of
laughter
was
expelling
the
spirit
of
tears
she
was
hardly
sensible
i
suspect
how
thoroughly
he
was
winding
himself
into
all
her
emotions
her
bygone
griefs
her
present
consolations
her
pitying
remembrance
of
her
husband
her
love
for
her
father
and
child
her
recollections
of
the
last
four
years
so
full
for
her
of
life
and
feeling
his
presence
recalled
by
turns
all
of
these
things
sweeping
gently
like
a
hand
timid
because
of
affection
over
every
chord
of
her
heart
man
has
great
power
over
a
woman
when
he
is
so
gifted
or
so
circumstanced
that
he
can
touch
that
strongest
part
of
her
nature
her
sentiments
however
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
colburne
was
at
this
time
playing
a
very
audible
tune
on
carter
or
that
he
even
distinctly
intended
to
touch
that
delicate
instrument
he
was
quite
aware
that
he
must
better
his
pecuniary
condition
before
he
could
honorably
meddle
in
such
lofty
music
i
must
go
to
work
he
said
after
he
had
been
at
home
nearly
three
months
i
shall
get
so
decayed
with
laziness
that
i
be
able
to
pick
myself
up
i
shall
cease
to
be
respectable
if
i
lounge
any
longer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
to
restore
my
health
yes
work
is
best
answered
the
doctor
it
is
our
earthly
glory
and
blessing
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
think
that
the
evil
spirit
of
is
pretty
much
exorcised
from
our
nation
the
victory
of
the
north
is
at
bottom
the
triumph
of
laboring
men
living
by
their
own
industry
over
men
who
wanted
to
live
by
the
industry
of
others
europe
sees
this
even
more
plainly
than
we
do
all
over
that
continent
the
industrious
classes
hail
the
triumph
of
the
north
as
their
own
victory
slavery
meant
in
reality
to
create
an
idle
nobility
liberty
has
established
an
industrious
democracy
in
working
for
our
own
living
we
are
obeying
the
teachings
of
this
war
the
triumphant
spirit
of
our
country
and
age
the
young
man
who
is
idle
now
belongs
to
bygone
and
centuries
he
is
more
of
an
old
fogy
than
the
narrowest
minded
or
emigrant
what
a
prosperous
hive
this
will
be
now
that
it
contains
no
class
of
drones
there
was
no
hope
of
good
from
slavery
it
was
like
that
side
of
the
moon
which
never
sees
the
bright
face
of
the
earth
and
whose
night
is
always
darkness
no
matter
how
the
heavens
revolve
yes
we
must
all
go
to
work
that
is
we
must
be
useful
and
respectable
i
am
very
glad
for
your
sake
that
you
have
studied
a
profession
a
young
man
brought
up
in
literary
and
scientific
circles
is
subject
to
the
temptation
of
concluding
that
it
will
be
a
fine
thing
to
have
no
calling
but
letters
he
is
apt
to
think
that
he
will
make
his
living
by
his
pen
now
that
is
all
wrong
it
is
wrong
because
the
pen
is
an
uncertain
means
of
existence
for
no
man
should
voluntarily
place
himself
in
the
condition
of
living
from
hand
to
mouth
every
university
man
as
well
as
every
other
man
should
learn
a
profession
or
a
business
or
a
trade
then
when
he
has
something
solid
to
fall
back
upon
he
may
if
he
chooses
try
what
he
can
do
as
a
scholar
or
author
i
shall
my
law
office
said
colburne
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
unhandsome
or
unfair
queried
the
doctor
if
i
too
should
open
an
office
and
take
such
patients
as
might
offer
i
do
see
it
i
do
see
it
at
all
responded
colburne
nor
do
i
either
considering
my
necessities
said
ravenel
meanwhile
calculating
internally
how
much
longer
his
small
cash
capital
would
last
at
the
present
rate
of
decrease
within
a
week
after
this
conversation
two
offices
were
opened
and
the
professional
ranks
of
new
boston
were
reinforced
by
one
doctor
and
one
lawyer
papa
now
that
you
have
set
up
a
sign
said
lillie
i
will
trust
you
entirely
with
ravvie
yes
women
always
ask
after
a
sign
observed
ravenel
it
is
astonishing
how
much
the
sex
believes
in
pretense
and
show
if
i
should
advertise
myself
no
matter
how
ignorant
i
might
be
as
a
specialist
in
female
maladies
i
could
have
all
the
lady
invalids
in
new
boston
for
patients
positively
i
sometimes
get
out
of
patience
with
the
sex
for
its
streaks
of
silliness
i
am
occasionally
tempted
to
believe
that
the
greatest
difficulty
which
man
has
overcome
in
climbing
the
heights
of
civilization
is
the
fact
that
he
has
had
to
tote
women
on
his
shoulders
i
thought
you
never
used
negro
phrases
papa
i
pass
that
one
tote
has
a
monosyllabic
vigor
about
it
which
pleads
for
it
you
know
poyser
says
that
women
are
fools
because
they
were
made
to
match
the
men
poyser
was
a
very
intelligent
woman
well
worthy
of
her
son
ike
returned
the
doctor
who
knew
next
to
nothing
of
novels
now
go
to
your
office
said
lillie
and
if
poyser
calls
on
you
do
give
her
the
pills
meant
for
partington
they
are
different
ladies
colburne
did
not
regret
that
he
had
been
a
soldier
he
would
not
have
missed
the
battle
of
cedar
creek
alone
for
a
thousand
dollars
but
he
sometimes
reflected
that
if
he
had
remained
at
home
during
the
last
three
years
he
might
now
be
in
a
lucrative
practice
from
his
salary
as
captain
he
had
been
able
to
lay
up
next
to
nothing
nominally
it
was
fifteen
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
but
the
income
tax
took
out
thirty
dollars
and
he
had
forfeited
the
monthly
ten
dollars
allowed
for
responsibility
of
arms
during
the
time
he
was
on
staff
duty
in
addition
to
which
gold
had
been
up
to
diminishing
the
cash
value
of
his
actual
pay
to
less
than
five
hundred
dollars
furthermore
he
had
lent
largely
to
brother
officers
and
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
the
borrowers
on
heroic
fields
had
not
always
been
repaid
van
zandt
owed
him
two
hundred
dollars
and
carter
had
fallen
before
he
could
return
him
a
similar
sum
nevertheless
thanks
to
the
industry
and
economy
of
a
father
long
since
buried
the
young
man
had
a
sufficient
income
to
support
him
while
he
could
plant
the
slowly
growing
trees
of
business
and
profit
he
could
live
but
could
he
marry
gold
was
falling
and
so
were
prices
but
even
before
the
war
one
thousand
dollars
a
year
would
not
support
two
and
now
it
certainly
would
be
insufficient
for
three
he
considered
this
question
a
great
deal
more
than
was
necessary
for
a
man
who
meant
to
be
a
bachelor
and
occasionally
a
recollection
of
whitewood
eighty
thousand
gave
him
a
pang
of
envy
or
jealousy
or
both
together
the
lucre
which
he
so
earnestly
desired
not
for
its
own
stupid
sake
but
for
the
gratification
of
a
secretly
nursed
purpose
began
to
flow
in
upon
him
in
small
but
constant
driblets
some
enthusiastic
people
gave
him
their
small
jobs
in
the
way
of
conveyancing
because
he
had
fought
three
years
for
his
country
and
at
least
somewhat
to
his
alarm
a
considerable
case
was
thrust
upon
him
with
a
retaining
fee
which
he
immediately
banked
as
being
too
large
for
his
pocket
conscious
that
his
legal
erudition
was
not
great
he
went
to
a
former
fellow
student
who
during
the
past
four
year
had
burrowed
himself
into
a
good
practice
and
proposed
that
they
should
take
the
case
in
partnership
you
shall
be
counsellor
said
he
and
i
will
be
advocate
you
shall
furnish
the
law
skeleton
of
the
plea
and
i
will
clothe
it
with
appeals
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
used
to
be
famous
for
spouting
you
know
and
i
think
i
could
ask
a
few
questions
i
will
do
it
for
a
third
said
the
other
who
was
not
himself
a
pleader
good
it
was
done
and
the
case
was
gained
the
pecuniary
profits
were
divided
but
colburne
carried
away
all
the
popular
fame
for
he
had
spouted
in
such
a
manner
as
quite
to
dissolve
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
two
young
men
went
into
partnership
on
the
basis
afforded
by
their
first
transaction
and
were
soon
in
possession
of
a
promising
if
not
an
opulent
business
it
began
to
seem
possible
that
at
a
not
very
distant
day
colburne
might
mean
something
if
he
should
say
i
endow
thee
with
my
worldly
goods
chapter
xxxvi
a
brace
of
offers
at
last
colburne
gave
carter
a
bouquet
it
was
a
more
significant
act
than
the
reader
who
loves
flowers
will
perceive
without
an
explanation
fond
as
he
was
of
pets
and
of
most
things
which
are
or
stand
as
emblems
of
innocence
he
cared
very
little
for
flowers
except
as
features
of
a
landscape
he
was
conscious
of
a
gratification
in
walking
along
a
field
path
which
ran
through
dandelions
buttercups
etc
but
he
never
would
have
thought
of
picking
one
of
them
for
his
own
pleasure
any
more
than
of
picking
a
maple
tree
in
short
he
was
deficient
in
that
sense
which
makes
so
many
people
crave
their
presence
and
could
probably
have
lived
in
a
flowerless
land
without
any
painful
sentiment
of
barrenness
therefore
it
was
only
a
profound
and
affectionate
study
into
carter
ways
and
tastes
which
brought
him
to
the
point
of
buying
and
bringing
to
her
a
bouquet
he
was
actually
surprised
at
the
flush
of
pleasure
with
which
she
received
it
a
pleasure
evidently
caused
in
great
measure
by
the
nature
of
the
gift
itself
and
only
in
small
part
he
thought
by
a
consciousness
of
the
motives
of
the
giver
he
watched
her
with
great
interest
while
she
gaily
filled
a
vase
with
water
put
the
bouquet
in
it
placed
it
on
the
mantel
piece
stepped
back
to
look
at
it
then
set
it
on
her
took
in
the
effect
once
more
drew
a
pleased
sigh
and
resumed
her
seat
her
graceful
form
showed
to
advantage
in
the
plain
black
dress
and
her
wavy
blonde
hair
seemed
to
him
specially
beautiful
in
its
contrast
with
her
plain
widow
cap
youth
with
its
health
and
hope
had
brought
back
the
rounded
outlines
which
at
one
time
had
been
a
little
wasted
by
maternity
and
sorrow
her
white
and
singularly
clear
skin
had
resumed
its
soft
roseate
tint
and
could
show
as
distinctly
as
ever
the
motions
of
the
blood
her
blue
eyes
if
not
as
gay
as
they
were
four
years
ago
were
more
eloquent
of
experience
thought
and
feeling
colburne
must
be
pardoned
for
thinking
that
she
was
more
beautiful
than
the
bouquet
and
for
wondering
how
she
could
prize
a
loveliness
so
much
inferior
in
grace
and
expression
to
her
own
do
you
know
she
said
and
then
checked
herself
she
was
about
to
remind
him
that
these
were
the
first
flowers
which
he
ever
gave
her
and
to
laugh
at
him
for
having
been
so
slow
in
divining
one
of
her
passions
but
the
idea
struck
her
that
the
gift
might
be
for
the
very
reason
of
its
novelty
too
significant
to
be
a
proper
subject
for
her
comments
do
you
know
she
continued
after
a
scarcely
perceptible
hesitation
that
i
am
not
so
fond
of
flowers
as
i
was
once
they
remind
me
of
louisiana
and
i
do
love
louisiana
but
this
is
thanking
you
very
poorly
for
your
present
she
added
after
another
and
longer
pause
you
know
that
i
am
obliged
to
you
do
you
i
do
said
colburne
he
had
been
many
times
repaid
for
his
offering
by
seeing
the
pains
which
she
took
to
preserve
it
and
place
it
to
the
best
advantage
it
is
very
odd
to
me
though
that
you
never
seemed
to
love
them
she
observed
reverting
to
her
first
thought
it
is
my
misfortune
i
have
a
pleasure
the
less
it
is
like
not
having
an
ear
for
music
how
can
you
love
poetry
without
loving
flowers
i
knew
a
sculptor
once
who
could
find
the
slightest
charm
or
the
slightest
exhibition
of
capacity
in
an
opera
i
had
a
soldier
in
my
company
who
could
see
perfectly
well
by
daylight
but
was
stone
blind
by
moonlight
that
is
the
way
some
of
us
are
made
we
are
but
partially
developed
or
rather
not
developed
equally
in
all
directions
my
√¶sthetic
self
seems
to
be
lacking
in
for
bouquets
if
i
could
carry
a
landscape
about
in
my
hand
i
think
i
would
but
not
a
bunch
of
flowers
but
you
love
children
and
they
are
flowers
ah
but
they
are
so
human
they
make
a
noise
they
appreciate
you
comprehensibly
they
go
after
a
fellow
so
you
like
people
who
go
after
you
thought
carter
smiling
to
herself
at
the
confession
somehow
she
was
interested
in
and
pleased
with
the
minutest
peculiarities
of
colburne
from
that
day
forward
her
work
table
rarely
lacked
a
bouquet
although
her
friend
means
after
paying
his
board
bill
were
not
by
any
means
ample
in
fact
there
soon
came
to
be
two
bouquets
representing
rival
admirers
of
the
lady
young
whitewood
who
loved
flowers
and
had
a
greenhouse
full
of
them
but
had
never
hitherto
dared
present
one
to
the
pretty
widow
took
courage
from
colburne
example
and
far
exceeded
him
in
the
sumptuousness
of
his
offerings
by
the
way
i
must
not
neglect
this
shy
gentleman
claims
to
a
place
in
my
narrative
he
was
a
prominent
figure
of
evenings
in
the
ravenel
parlor
and
did
a
great
deal
of
talking
there
on
learned
subjects
with
the
doctor
sitting
the
while
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
with
his
thin
legs
twisted
around
each
other
in
such
a
way
as
to
exhibit
with
painful
distinctness
their
bony
outlines
each
of
these
young
men
was
considerably
afraid
of
the
other
colburne
recognized
the
fact
that
a
fortune
of
eighty
thousand
dollars
would
be
a
very
suitable
adjunct
to
carter
personal
and
social
graces
and
that
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
in
her
to
accept
it
if
offered
as
it
seemed
likely
to
be
whitewood
bowed
modestly
to
colburne
superior
conversational
cleverness
and
humbled
himself
in
the
dust
before
his
honorable
fame
as
a
soldier
what
was
he
a
man
of
peace
a
patriot
who
had
only
talked
and
paid
in
comparison
with
this
other
man
who
had
shed
his
blood
and
risked
his
life
for
their
common
country
and
the
cause
of
human
progress
so
when
the
captain
talked
to
carter
the
tutor
contented
himself
with
doctor
ravenel
he
was
painfully
conscious
of
his
own
stiffness
and
coldness
of
style
and
mourned
over
it
and
envied
the
ease
and
warmth
of
these
southerners
to
this
subject
he
frequently
alluded
driven
thereto
by
a
sort
of
agony
of
conviction
for
the
objective
whitewood
imperfectly
expressed
the
subjective
who
thought
earnestly
and
felt
ardently
i
do
understand
he
said
mournfully
why
people
of
the
same
blood
should
be
so
different
in
fact
so
opposed
in
manner
as
are
the
northerners
and
southerners
the
difference
springs
from
a
radical
difference
of
purpose
in
their
lives
said
the
doctor
the
south
meant
oligarchy
and
imitated
the
manners
of
the
european
nobility
the
democratic
north
means
equality
every
man
standing
on
his
own
legs
and
not
bestriding
other
men
shoulders
every
man
passing
for
just
what
he
is
and
no
more
it
means
honesty
sincerity
frankness
in
word
as
well
as
deed
it
means
general
hard
work
too
in
consequence
of
which
there
is
less
chance
to
cultivate
the
graces
the
polish
of
the
south
is
superficial
and
like
that
of
the
poles
and
all
other
slaveholding
oligarchies
i
confess
however
that
i
should
like
to
see
a
little
more
sympathy
and
expansion
in
the
northern
manners
a
native
untravelled
new
bostonian
is
rather
too
much
in
the
style
of
an
iceberg
he
is
enough
to
cause
atmospheric
condensation
and
changes
of
temperature
it
is
a
story
that
when
a
new
yankee
arrives
in
the
warm
air
of
louisiana
there
is
always
a
shower
but
that
you
know
is
an
exaggeration
whitewood
laughed
in
a
disconcerted
manner
nevertheless
they
do
a
vast
deal
of
good
continued
the
doctor
they
purify
as
well
as
disturb
the
atmosphere
to
me
a
southerner
it
is
a
humiliating
reflection
that
but
for
these
yankees
and
their
cold
moral
purity
we
should
have
established
a
society
upon
the
basis
of
the
most
horrible
slavery
that
the
world
has
known
since
the
days
of
pagan
rome
whitewood
glanced
at
carter
she
smiled
acquiescence
and
sympathy
her
conversion
from
secession
and
slavery
was
complete
all
this
while
colburne
boarded
at
the
new
boston
house
and
saw
the
doctor
and
carter
and
ravvie
every
day
when
they
went
down
to
the
for
a
week
during
the
hot
weather
he
could
not
leave
his
business
to
accompany
them
as
he
wished
but
must
stay
in
new
boston
feeling
miserably
lonesome
of
evenings
although
he
knew
hundreds
of
people
in
the
little
city
it
was
an
aggravation
of
his
troubles
to
learn
that
whitewood
had
followed
the
ravenels
to
the
when
the
family
returned
still
accompanied
by
the
eighty
thousand
dollar
youth
colburne
looked
very
searchingly
into
the
eyes
of
carter
to
discover
if
possible
what
she
had
been
doing
with
herself
she
noticed
it
and
blushed
deeply
which
puzzled
and
troubled
him
through
hours
of
subsequent
meditation
if
they
were
engaged
they
would
certainly
tell
me
thought
he
but
nevertheless
he
was
not
entirely
easy
about
the
matter
it
happened
the
next
evening
that
he
lounged
into
one
of
the
small
parlors
of
the
hotel
intending
to
pass
out
upon
a
little
front
balcony
and
look
at
the
moonlit
glories
of
the
common
a
murmur
of
two
voices
a
male
voice
and
a
female
came
in
from
the
balcony
and
checked
his
advance
as
he
hesitated
young
whitewood
entered
the
room
through
the
open
window
hastily
followed
a
moment
afterward
by
carter
whitewood
please
say
nothing
about
this
she
whispered
of
course
you
will
not
i
never
shall
certainly
not
replied
the
young
man
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
was
so
low
that
colburne
could
detect
no
expression
in
it
whether
of
despondency
or
triumph
entering
as
they
did
from
the
moonlight
into
a
room
which
had
been
left
unlighted
in
order
to
keep
out
summer
insects
neither
of
them
perceived
the
involuntary
listener
whitewood
went
out
by
the
door
and
carter
returned
to
the
balcony
in
order
that
the
reader
may
be
spared
the
trouble
of
turning
over
a
few
pages
here
i
will
state
frankly
that
the
young
man
had
proposed
and
been
refused
and
that
carter
had
begged
him
not
to
let
the
affair
get
abroad
because
well
because
a
sudden
impulse
came
over
her
to
do
just
that
whether
it
concerned
her
or
not
to
keep
the
secret
colburne
remained
alone
in
such
an
agony
of
anxiety
as
he
had
not
believed
himself
capable
of
feeling
all
the
stoicism
which
he
had
learned
by
forced
marches
starvations
and
battles
was
insufficient
or
was
not
of
the
proper
kind
to
sustain
him
comfortably
under
the
torture
inflicted
by
his
supposed
discovery
the
rachel
whom
he
had
waited
for
more
than
four
years
was
again
lost
to
him
but
was
she
lost
asked
the
hope
that
never
dies
in
us
it
was
not
positively
certain
words
and
situations
may
have
different
meanings
his
rival
did
not
seem
much
elated
he
would
ask
carter
what
the
scene
meant
and
learn
his
fate
at
once
she
would
not
keep
the
secret
from
him
when
he
should
tell
her
the
motives
which
induced
him
to
question
her
whether
she
refused
him
or
not
whether
she
was
or
was
not
engaged
to
another
he
would
of
course
be
entirely
frank
with
her
only
regretting
that
he
had
not
been
so
before
he
was
enough
he
had
learned
at
least
this
much
of
not
to
try
to
save
his
vanity
in
such
a
matter
as
loving
for
life
as
the
most
loveable
woman
that
he
had
ever
known
it
was
due
to
her
that
she
should
be
informed
that
his
heart
was
at
her
command
no
matter
what
she
might
do
with
it
the
feeling
of
the
moment
was
a
grand
one
but
not
beyond
the
native
power
of
his
character
although
three
years
ago
he
had
not
been
sufficiently
developed
to
be
capable
of
it
he
stepped
to
the
window
pushed
apart
the
long
damask
curtains
and
stood
by
her
side
oh
is
it
you
she
exclaimed
you
quite
startled
me
then
after
a
moment
hesitation
when
did
you
come
in
i
was
in
the
room
three
minutes
ago
he
answered
and
paused
to
draw
a
long
breath
tell
me
carter
he
resumed
what
is
it
that
whitewood
is
to
keep
secret
mr
colburne
she
replied
full
of
astonishment
that
he
should
put
such
a
question
i
did
not
overhear
intentionally
he
went
on
i
did
not
hear
much
and
i
wish
to
know
more
than
i
heard
colburne
was
master
of
the
situation
although
he
was
not
aware
of
it
surprise
was
the
least
of
lillie
emotions
she
was
quite
overwhelmed
by
her
lover
presence
and
by
the
question
which
he
put
to
her
she
could
not
have
declared
truly
at
the
moment
that
her
soul
was
altogether
her
own
oh
colburne
i
can
not
tell
you
was
all
she
could
say
and
that
in
a
whisper
she
would
have
told
him
all
if
he
had
insisted
but
he
did
not
he
had
manliness
enough
he
was
sufficiently
able
to
affront
danger
and
suffering
to
say
what
was
in
his
own
heart
without
knowing
what
had
passed
between
her
and
his
rival
he
stood
silent
a
moment
pondering
not
over
his
purpose
but
as
to
what
his
words
should
be
then
flashed
across
him
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
that
whitewood
had
made
his
venture
and
met
with
shipwreck
a
wave
of
strong
hope
seemed
to
lift
him
over
reefs
of
doubt
and
shook
him
so
like
a
ship
trembling
on
a
billow
that
for
an
instant
longer
he
could
not
speak
just
then
recognizable
irish
voice
was
heard
calling
carter
carter
might
i
spake
t
ye
what
is
it
asked
lillie
stepping
by
colburne
into
the
parlor
ravvie
was
cutting
a
double
tooth
was
feverish
and
fretful
and
she
had
been
anxious
about
him
i
like
t
have
ye
see
the
baby
i
thinkin
he
ought
t
have
somethin
done
for
he
mightily
worried
please
excuse
me
colburne
said
the
mother
and
ran
up
stairs
thus
it
happened
that
lillie
unintentionally
evaded
the
somewhat
remarkable
and
humiliating
circumstance
of
receiving
two
declarations
of
love
two
offers
of
marriage
in
a
single
evening
she
did
not
however
know
precisely
what
it
was
that
she
had
escaped
and
moreover
she
did
not
at
first
think
much
about
it
except
in
a
very
fragmentary
and
unsatisfactory
manner
for
ravvie
soon
went
into
convulsions
and
remained
in
a
precarious
condition
the
whole
night
absorbing
all
her
time
and
attention
of
course
he
had
his
gums
lanced
and
his
chubby
feet
put
in
hot
water
and
medicine
poured
down
his
patient
throat
in
the
morning
he
was
so
comfortable
that
his
mother
went
to
bed
and
slept
till
noon
when
she
awoke
and
found
ravvie
quite
recovered
and
had
kissed
his
cheeks
his
dimpled
neck
and
the
fat
collops
in
his
legs
a
hundred
times
or
so
and
called
him
her
own
precious
and
her
dearest
darling
and
her
sweet
little
man
at
every
kiss
she
began
to
dress
herself
and
to
think
of
colburne
and
of
his
unexplained
anxieties
to
say
what
she
went
tremulously
to
dinner
blushing
scarlet
after
her
sensitive
manner
as
she
entered
the
but
quite
unnecessarily
inasmuch
as
he
was
not
at
table
she
could
not
say
whether
she
was
most
relieved
or
annoyed
by
his
unexpected
absence
it
is
worthy
of
record
that
before
she
had
learned
through
some
roundabout
medium
rosann
and
the
porter
i
fear
that
colburne
had
been
summoned
to
new
york
by
a
telegram
and
was
not
expected
back
for
a
day
or
two
her
father
was
away
on
a
mineralogical
hunt
unearthing
burrows
and
warrens
of
smithites
and
brownites
thus
she
had
plenty
of
opportunity
for
reflection
and
she
probably
employed
it
as
well
as
most
young
women
would
under
similar
circumstances
but
of
course
to
no
purpose
at
all
so
far
as
concerned
taking
any
action
in
such
matters
a
woman
can
do
little
more
than
sit
still
while
others
transact
her
history
she
was
under
the
spell
it
was
not
she
who
would
control
her
own
fate
it
was
colburne
she
was
ashamed
and
almost
angry
to
find
that
she
was
so
weak
she
declared
that
it
was
disgraceful
to
fall
in
love
with
a
man
who
had
not
yet
told
her
plainly
that
he
loved
her
but
all
her
shame
and
anger
and
declarations
could
not
alter
the
stubborn
fact
she
would
never
own
it
to
any
one
else
but
she
was
obliged
to
confess
it
to
herself
although
the
avowal
made
her
cry
with
vexation
she
had
to
remember
too
that
it
was
not
quite
two
years
and
a
half
since
she
was
married
and
not
quite
eighteen
months
since
she
had
become
a
widow
she
walked
through
a
valley
of
humiliation
very
meek
in
spirit
and
yet
it
must
be
confessed
not
very
unhappy
at
times
she
defended
herself
asking
the
honest
and
rational
question
how
could
she
help
loving
this
man
he
had
been
so
faithful
and
delicate
he
was
so
brave
and
noble
that
she
wondered
that
every
woman
who
knew
him
did
not
adore
him
and
then
as
she
thought
of
his
perfections
she
went
tremblingly
back
to
the
inquiry
did
he
love
her
he
had
not
gone
so
far
as
to
say
it
or
anything
approaching
to
it
and
yet
he
surely
would
not
have
asked
her
what
had
passed
between
another
man
and
herself
unless
he
meant
to
lay
bare
to
her
his
inmost
heart
she
knew
that
he
was
too
generously
delicate
to
demand
such
a
confidence
except
with
a
most
serious
and
tender
purpose
she
did
not
indeed
suppose
that
he
would
have
gone
on
then
to
say
everything
that
he
felt
for
her
for
it
did
not
seem
to
her
that
any
one
moment
which
she
could
fix
upon
would
be
great
enough
for
such
a
revelation
but
it
would
have
come
in
time
if
she
had
answered
him
suitably
it
might
come
yet
if
she
had
not
offended
him
and
if
he
did
not
meet
some
one
whom
he
should
see
to
be
more
desirable
she
offended
him
by
her
manner
or
by
what
she
had
said
or
failed
to
say
oh
how
easy
it
is
to
suspect
that
those
whom
we
love
are
vexed
with
us
if
it
should
be
so
that
she
had
given
him
cause
of
anger
how
could
she
make
peace
with
him
without
demeaning
herself
well
let
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
there
was
her
boy
who
would
always
be
faithful
and
loving
she
kissed
him
violently
and
repeatedly
but
could
not
keep
a
tear
or
two
from
falling
on
him
although
why
they
were
shed
the
child
could
have
explained
as
rationally
as
she
of
all
these
struggles
colburne
knew
nothing
and
guessed
nothing
he
too
had
his
yearnings
and
anxieties
although
he
did
not
express
them
by
kissing
anything
or
crying
upon
anything
he
was
sternly
fearful
lest
he
was
losing
moments
and
he
attended
to
his
business
in
new
york
as
energetically
as
he
would
have
stormed
a
battery
had
he
offended
carter
had
whitewood
succeeded
or
failed
or
not
tried
he
could
not
answer
any
of
these
questions
but
he
was
in
a
fury
to
get
back
to
new
boston
lillie
trembled
when
she
heard
his
knock
upon
the
door
at
eight
that
evening
she
knew
it
was
his
by
instinct
she
had
known
it
two
or
three
times
during
the
day
when
it
was
only
a
servant
but
at
last
she
was
right
in
her
divination
she
was
trying
at
the
moment
to
write
a
letter
to
her
father
with
the
door
open
into
her
where
ravvie
sat
under
the
benign
spectacles
of
rosann
in
answer
to
her
come
in
colburne
entered
looking
pale
with
want
of
sleep
for
he
had
worked
nights
and
travelled
days
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
back
she
said
in
her
frank
way
and
i
am
so
glad
to
get
back
he
replied
dropping
wearily
into
an
easy
chair
when
does
your
father
return
i
do
know
he
told
me
to
write
to
him
at
springfield
until
i
got
word
to
stop
colburne
was
pleased
the
doctor
would
not
be
at
home
for
a
day
or
two
that
would
give
him
other
opportunities
in
case
this
one
should
result
in
a
failure
the
little
parlor
looked
more
formidable
than
the
balcony
and
the
glare
of
the
gas
was
not
so
encouraging
as
the
mellow
moonlight
he
did
not
feel
sure
how
he
should
be
able
to
speak
here
where
she
could
see
every
working
of
his
countenance
he
did
not
know
that
from
the
moment
he
began
to
speak
of
the
subject
which
filled
his
heart
she
would
not
be
able
to
look
him
in
the
face
until
after
she
had
promised
to
be
his
altogether
and
forever
women
always
will
talk
at
such
times
they
seem
to
dread
to
be
caught
and
to
know
that
silence
is
a
dangerous
trap
for
the
feelings
and
consequently
they
prattle
about
anything
no
matter
what
provided
the
prattle
will
prolong
the
time
during
which
the
hunter
is
in
chase
you
look
quite
worn
out
with
your
journey
she
said
i
should
think
you
had
made
a
forced
march
to
new
york
and
back
on
foot
i
have
been
under
the
necessity
of
working
nights
he
answered
without
telling
her
that
it
was
the
desire
to
return
as
quickly
as
possible
to
her
which
had
constituted
the
forcing
power
you
should
do
it
you
will
wear
yourself
down
again
as
you
did
in
field
service
no
there
are
no
privations
here
no
hunger
and
no
food
more
unwholesome
than
hunger
no
suffering
with
cold
no
malaria
if
i
fall
sick
here
it
will
only
be
with
living
too
well
and
having
too
easy
a
time
somebody
says
that
death
is
a
disgrace
that
man
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
dying
i
am
inclined
to
admit
it
unless
the
man
is
in
field
service
in
field
service
i
have
suffered
keenly
now
and
then
so
as
to
become
babyish
about
it
and
think
of
you
and
how
glad
you
would
be
to
give
me
something
to
eat
she
made
no
reply
except
to
look
at
him
steadily
for
a
moment
admiring
what
seemed
to
her
the
heroism
of
speaking
so
lightly
of
hardships
you
see
i
confided
strongly
in
your
kindness
he
resumed
i
do
so
still
the
color
flooded
her
face
and
neck
as
she
divined
from
his
manner
that
he
was
about
to
resume
the
conversation
of
the
balcony
he
rose
walked
to
the
door
which
led
into
the
closed
it
gently
and
came
back
she
could
not
speak
nor
raise
her
eyes
to
his
face
as
he
stood
before
her
if
he
had
kept
silence
for
a
few
moments
she
would
probably
have
recovered
herself
and
said
wo
you
sit
down
or
some
such
insanity
but
he
did
not
give
her
time
for
that
he
took
one
of
her
hands
in
both
of
his
and
said
lillie
there
was
a
question
in
the
tone
but
she
could
not
answer
it
except
by
suddenly
raising
her
other
hand
to
her
face
as
if
to
hide
the
confession
which
was
glowing
there
you
know
that
i
have
loved
you
four
years
he
went
on
bending
down
to
her
and
whispering
she
never
knew
how
it
was
that
she
found
herself
a
moment
afterwards
on
her
feet
leaning
against
his
breast
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
sobbing
trembling
but
full
of
joy
the
man
whom
she
ought
always
to
have
loved
the
man
whom
she
now
did
love
with
the
whole
strength
of
her
being
whom
she
could
trust
perfectly
and
forever
had
claimed
her
as
his
and
she
had
resigned
herself
to
him
not
desiring
to
reserve
a
drop
of
her
blood
or
a
thought
of
her
soul
nothing
could
separate
them
but
death
nothing
could
make
them
unhappy
but
losing
each
other
for
the
moment
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
they
two
and
their
love
after
a
time
it
might
have
been
five
minutes
or
half
an
hour
she
remembered
positively
recollected
with
a
start
that
she
had
a
child
come
and
see
him
she
said
come
and
look
at
our
boy
she
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
willing
to
go
into
the
room
where
ravvie
lay
asleep
she
never
thought
of
her
flushed
face
and
disordered
hair
although
rosann
spectacles
were
fixed
upon
her
with
an
astonishment
which
seemed
to
enlarge
their
orbits
is
he
beautiful
she
whispered
he
is
yours
mine
ours
rosann
gave
her
head
a
toss
of
comprehension
and
satisfaction
in
which
i
heartily
join
her
as
does
also
i
hope
the
reader
colburne
and
then
lillie
kissed
the
child
all
unconscious
of
the
love
which
was
lavished
on
him
which
filled
the
room
and
was
copious
enough
to
fill
lives
it
had
all
come
like
a
great
surprise
to
lillie
as
much
as
she
may
have
desired
it
as
much
as
she
may
have
hoped
it
in
moments
for
which
she
reproached
herself
at
the
time
as
absurd
and
almost
immodest
it
nevertheless
descended
upon
her
this
revelation
with
wings
of
dazzling
astonishment
in
the
night
she
awoke
to
disbelieve
and
then
to
remember
all
with
a
joyful
faith
and
while
thinking
it
over
in
a
delicious
reverie
which
could
not
justly
be
called
thought
but
rather
a
thrilling
succession
of
recollections
and
sentiments
there
came
to
her
among
the
multitude
of
impressions
a
wonder
at
her
own
happiness
she
seemed
with
amazement
to
see
herself
in
double
the
one
figure
widowed
and
weeping
seated
amid
the
tombs
of
perished
hopes
the
other
also
widowed
in
garb
but
about
to
put
on
garments
of
bridal
white
and
with
a
face
which
lit
up
the
darkness
how
can
it
be
she
exclaimed
aloud
as
she
remembered
the
despair
of
eighteen
months
ago
then
she
added
smiling
with
a
delicious
consciousness
of
justification
oh
i
love
him
better
than
i
ever
loved
any
other
i
am
right
in
loving
him
after
that
she
commended
the
one
who
was
dead
to
pity
and
then
prayed
long
and
fervently
for
the
newly
loved
one
who
was
living
but
brokenly
too
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
smile
at
his
bright
image
painted
on
the
night
last
came
a
prayer
for
her
child
whom
she
might
have
forgotten
in
these
passionate
emotions
only
that
she
could
hear
his
gentle
breathing
through
the
quiet
midnight
i
wonder
how
you
can
love
me
so
when
i
kept
you
so
long
away
from
me
she
said
to
colburne
at
their
next
meeting
you
are
all
the
dearer
for
it
he
answered
yes
even
because
another
stood
for
a
long
time
between
us
you
are
all
the
dearer
perhaps
it
ought
not
to
be
so
but
so
it
is
my
darling
her
gratitude
was
uttered
in
a
silent
fervent
pressure
of
her
lips
against
his
cheek
these
were
the
only
words
that
passed
between
them
concerning
her
first
marriage
where
are
we
to
live
he
asked
do
you
want
to
go
back
to
new
orleans
oh
never
she
replied
always
at
the
north
i
like
it
so
much
better
she
was
willing
at
all
times
now
to
make
confession
of
her
conversion
chapter
xxxvii
a
marriage
doctor
ravenel
was
delighted
when
lillie
blushing
monstrously
and
with
one
arm
around
his
neck
and
her
face
at
first
a
little
behind
his
shoulder
confided
to
him
the
new
revelation
which
had
made
her
life
doubly
precious
i
never
was
more
happy
since
i
came
into
the
world
my
dear
he
said
i
am
entirely
satisfied
i
do
most
heartily
return
thanks
for
this
i
believe
that
now
your
happiness
and
are
assured
so
far
as
they
can
be
by
any
human
circumstance
he
is
the
noblest
young
man
that
i
ever
knew
shall
i
send
him
to
you
to
implore
your
consent
she
asked
roguishly
do
you
want
a
chance
to
domineer
over
him
the
doctor
laughed
outright
at
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
i
feel
said
he
as
though
i
ought
to
ask
his
consent
i
ought
to
apologize
to
the
municipal
authorities
for
taking
the
finest
fellow
in
the
city
away
from
the
young
ladies
of
native
birth
seriously
my
dear
child
you
will
have
to
try
hard
in
order
to
be
good
enough
for
him
go
away
answered
lillie
with
a
little
push
papas
are
the
most
ungrateful
of
all
human
beings
well
if
i
am
not
good
enough
there
is
ravvie
and
you
i
throw
you
both
in
to
make
it
an
even
bargain
it
was
soon
decided
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
early
in
september
lillie
had
never
had
a
long
engagement
and
did
not
now
specially
care
for
one
being
therein
i
understand
similar
to
most
widows
when
they
are
once
persuaded
to
exchange
their
mourning
for
bridal
attire
men
never
like
that
period
of
expectation
and
colburne
urged
an
early
day
for
his
inauguration
as
monarch
of
a
heart
and
household
his
family
homestead
just
now
tenantless
was
made
fine
by
the
application
of
much
paint
and
and
the
introduction
of
new
articles
of
furniture
lillie
and
he
visited
it
nearly
every
day
during
their
brief
betrothal
usually
accompanied
by
ravvie
in
the
wicker
and
were
very
happy
in
dressing
up
the
neglected
garden
arranging
and
the
chairs
and
tables
and
planning
how
the
rooms
should
be
distributed
among
the
family
to
the
doctor
was
assigned
the
best
front
and
to
the
smithites
and
brownites
an
adjoining
closet
of
abundant
dimensions
ravvie
and
rosann
shall
have
the
back
chamber
said
lillie
so
that
ravvie
can
look
out
on
the
garden
and
be
away
from
the
dust
of
the
street
i
am
so
delighted
that
the
little
fellow
is
at
last
to
have
a
garden
and
flowers
you
and
i
will
take
the
other
front
bedroom
next
to
papa
here
she
colored
at
her
own
frankness
and
hurried
on
to
other
dispositions
that
will
leave
us
two
little
rooms
for
servants
up
stairs
and
down
stairs
we
shall
have
a
parlor
and
and
kitchen
we
shall
fairly
lose
ourselves
how
much
pleasanter
than
a
hotel
colburne
had
noticed
her
blush
with
a
sense
of
pleasure
and
triumph
but
he
was
generous
enough
and
delicate
enough
to
spare
her
any
allusion
to
it
you
have
left
no
place
for
friends
he
merely
observed
oh
but
we
must
entertain
much
for
a
while
we
you
can
not
afford
it
i
have
been
catechising
whitewood
about
the
cost
of
meat
and
things
prices
are
dreadful
after
a
little
pause
she
broke
out
oh
wo
it
be
delightful
to
have
a
house
and
garden
and
flowers
ravvie
will
be
so
happy
here
we
shall
all
be
so
happy
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
and
you
do
want
a
wedding
tour
oh
yes
i
want
it
but
my
darling
you
can
not
afford
it
you
must
not
tempt
me
we
will
have
the
wedding
tour
five
years
hence
when
we
come
to
celebrate
our
wooden
wedding
then
you
will
be
rich
perhaps
the
grand
ceremony
which
legalized
and
ratified
all
these
arrangements
took
place
at
five
in
the
afternoon
in
the
little
church
of
joseph
the
city
being
yet
small
enough
to
feel
a
decided
interest
in
the
private
affairs
of
any
noted
citizen
a
crowd
of
uninvited
spectators
collected
to
witness
the
marriage
of
the
popular
young
captain
with
the
widow
of
the
lamented
union
general
stories
of
how
the
father
had
given
up
his
all
for
the
sake
of
the
republic
how
colburne
had
saved
carter
from
a
brigade
of
texans
and
how
the
dying
general
had
bequeathed
the
care
of
his
family
to
the
captain
on
the
field
of
victory
circulated
among
the
lookers
on
and
inflamed
them
to
an
enthusiasm
which
exhibited
itself
in
a
violent
waving
of
handkerchief
as
the
little
bridal
party
came
out
of
the
church
and
drove
homeward
since
new
boston
was
founded
no
other
nuptials
had
been
so
celebrated

may
believe

had
his
wife
and
his
wife
had
her
home
for
the
last
four
years
they
have
sailed
separately
over
stormy
seas
but
now
they
are
in
a
quiet
haven
united
so
long
as
life
shall
last
it
grieves
me
to
leave
this
young
woman
thus
on
the
threshold
of
her
history
here
she
is
at
with
but
one
child
and
only
at
her
second
husband
of
her
years
and
heart
history
are
probably
before
her
women
are
most
interesting
at
thirty
then
only
do
they
in
general
enter
upon
their
full
bloom
physical
moral
and
intellectual
then
only
do
they
attain
their
highest
charm
as
members
of
society
but
a
sense
of
artistic
fitness
derived
from
a
belief
that
now
she
has
a
sure
start
in
the
voyage
of
happiness
compels
me
to
close
the
biography
of
my
heroine
at
her
marriage
with
my
favorite
colburne
moreover
it
will
be
perceived
that
if
i
continue
her
story
i
shall
have
to
do
it
through
the
medium
of
prophecy
which
might
give
it
an
air
of
improbability
to
the
reader
besides
leading
me
to
assume
certain
grave
responsibilities
such
for
instance
as
deciding
the
next
presidential
election
without
waiting
for
the
verdict
of
the
people
we
need
have
no
fears
about
the
prospects
of
colburne
it
is
true
that
during
his
military
career
luck
has
been
against
him
and
he
has
not
received
promotion
although
he
deserved
it
but
his
disappointment
in
not
obtaining
great
military
glory
will
finally
give
strength
to
his
character
and
secure
to
him
perfect
manliness
and
success
it
has
taken
down
his
false
pride
and
taught
him
to
use
means
for
ends
moreover
it
will
preserve
him
from
being
enfeebled
by
a
dropsy
of
vanity
had
he
been
mustered
out
of
service
as
a
of
volunteers
he
might
possibly
have
disdained
the
small
beginnings
of
a
law
business
demanded
a
foreign
consulate
or
home
collectorship
and
became
a
state
pauper
for
life
as
it
is
he
will
stand
on
his
own
base
which
is
a
broad
and
solid
one
and
the
men
around
him
will
have
no
advantage
over
him
except
so
far
as
their
individual
bases
are
better
than
his
for
in
civilian
life
there
is
no
rank
nor
seniority
and
the
close
corporation
of
political
cabal
has
little
influence
the
chivalrous
sentiment
which
would
not
let
him
beg
for
promotion
will
show
forth
in
a
resolute
and
an
incorruptible
honor
which
in
the
long
run
will
be
to
his
outward
advantage
his
responsibilities
will
take
all
dreaminess
out
of
him
and
make
him
practical
industrious
able
to
arrive
at
results
his
courage
will
prolong
his
health
and
his
health
will
be
used
in
effective
labor
he
has
the
patience
of
a
soldier
and
a
soldier
fortitude
under
discouragement
he
is
a
better
and
stronger
man
for
having
fought
three
years
death
and
suffering
like
the
nation
he
has
developed
and
learned
his
powers
possessing
more
physical
and
intellectual
vigor
than
is
merely
necessary
to
exist
he
will
succeed
in
the
duties
of
life
and
control
other
men
lives
labors
opinions
successes
it
is
greatly
to
his
honor
it
is
a
sure
promise
of
his
future
that
he
understands
his
seeming
failure
as
a
soldier
and
is
not
discouraged
by
it
but
takes
hold
of
the
next
thing
to
do
with
confident
energy
he
is
the
soldier
citizen
he
could
face
the
flame
of
battle
for
his
country
he
can
also
earn
his
own
living
he
could
leave
his
to
march
and
fight
for
three
years
and
he
can
return
to
peaceful
industry
as
ennobling
as
his
fighting
it
is
in
millions
of
such
men
that
the
strength
of
the
republic
consists
as
for
his
domestic
history
i
think
that
we
need
have
no
terrors
either
for
his
happiness
or
that
of

i
do
see
but
that
you

along
very
well

she
never
either
whimpers
over
the
sorrowful
lot
of

or
snarls
and
chuckles
over
his
follies

littlenesses

her

unexceptionable
excellence

felicity
