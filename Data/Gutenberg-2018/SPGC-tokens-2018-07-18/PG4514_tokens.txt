granice
pacing
the
length
of
his
pleasant
library
paused
to
compare
his
watch
with
the
clock
on
the
three
minutes
to
eight
in
exactly
three
minutes
peter
ascham
of
the
eminent
legal
firm
of
ascham
and
pettilow
would
have
his
punctual
hand
on
the
of
the
flat
it
was
a
comfort
to
reflect
that
ascham
was
so
punctual
the
suspense
was
beginning
to
make
his
host
nervous
and
the
sound
of
the
would
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
after
that
there
d
be
no
going
back
by
god
no
going
back
granice
resumed
his
pacing
each
time
he
reached
the
end
of
the
room
opposite
the
door
he
caught
his
reflection
in
the
florentine
mirror
above
the
fine
old
walnut
he
had
picked
up
at
dijon
saw
himself
spare
carefully
brushed
and
dressed
but
furrowed
gray
about
the
temples
with
a
stoop
which
he
corrected
by
a
spasmodic
straightening
of
the
shoulders
whenever
a
glass
confronted
him
a
tired
man
baffled
beaten
worn
out
as
he
summed
himself
up
thus
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
the
door
opened
and
he
turned
with
a
thrill
of
relief
to
greet
his
guest
but
it
was
only
the
who
entered
advancing
silently
over
the
mossy
surface
of
the
old
turkey
rug
mr
ascham
telephones
sir
to
say
he
s
unexpectedly
detained
and
can
t
be
here
till
granice
made
a
curt
gesture
of
annoyance
it
was
becoming
harder
and
harder
for
him
to
control
these
reflexes
he
turned
on
his
heel
tossing
to
the
servant
over
his
shoulder
very
good
put
off
down
his
spine
he
felt
the
man
s
injured
stare
granice
had
always
been
so
to
his
people
no
doubt
the
odd
change
in
his
manner
had
already
been
noticed
and
discussed
below
stairs
and
very
likely
they
suspected
the
cause
he
stood
drumming
on
the
till
he
heard
the
servant
go
out
then
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
propping
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
resting
his
chin
on
his
locked
hands
another
half
hour
alone
with
it
he
wondered
irritably
what
could
have
detained
his
guest
some
professional
matter
no
doubt
the
punctilious
lawyer
would
have
allowed
nothing
less
to
interfere
with
a
dinner
engagement
more
especially
since
granice
in
his
note
had
said
i
shall
want
a
little
business
chat
but
what
professional
matter
could
have
come
up
at
that
unprofessional
hour
perhaps
some
other
soul
in
misery
had
called
on
the
lawyer
and
after
all
granice
s
note
had
given
no
hint
of
his
own
need
no
doubt
ascham
thought
he
merely
wanted
to
make
another
change
in
his
will
since
he
had
come
into
his
little
property
ten
years
earlier
granice
had
been
perpetually
tinkering
with
his
will
suddenly
another
thought
pulled
him
up
sending
a
flush
to
his
sallow
temples
he
remembered
a
word
he
had
tossed
to
the
lawyer
some
six
weeks
earlier
at
the
century
club
yes
my
play
s
as
good
as
taken
i
shall
be
calling
on
you
soon
to
go
over
the
contract
those
theatrical
chaps
are
so
slippery
i
won
t
trust
anybody
but
you
to
tie
the
knot
for
me
that
of
course
was
what
ascham
would
think
he
was
wanted
for
granice
at
the
idea
broke
into
an
audible
laugh
a
queer
like
the
cackle
of
a
baffled
villain
in
a
melodrama
the
absurdity
the
unnaturalness
of
the
sound
abashed
him
and
he
compressed
his
lips
angrily
would
he
take
to
soliloquy
next
he
lowered
his
arms
and
pulled
open
the
upper
drawer
of
the
in
the
corner
lay
a
thick
manuscript
bound
in
paper
folders
and
tied
with
a
string
beneath
which
a
letter
had
been
slipped
next
to
the
manuscript
was
a
small
revolver
granice
stared
a
moment
at
these
oddly
associated
objects
then
he
took
the
letter
from
under
the
string
and
slowly
began
to
open
it
he
had
known
he
should
do
so
from
the
moment
his
hand
touched
the
drawer
whenever
his
eye
fell
on
that
letter
some
relentless
force
compelled
him
to
it
it
was
dated
about
four
weeks
back
under
the
of
the
diversity
my
dear
granice
i
have
given
the
matter
my
best
consideration
for
the
last
month
and
it
s
no
use
the
play
won
t
do
i
have
talked
it
over
with
miss
melrose
and
you
know
there
isn
t
a
gamer
artist
on
our
stage
and
i
regret
to
tell
you
she
feels
just
as
i
do
about
it
it
isn
t
the
poetry
that
scares
her
or
me
either
we
both
want
to
do
all
we
can
to
help
along
the
poetic
drama
we
believe
the
public
s
ready
for
it
and
we
re
willing
to
take
a
big
financial
risk
in
order
to
be
the
first
to
give
them
what
they
want
we
don
t
believe
they
could
be
made
to
want
the
fact
is
there
isn
t
enough
drama
in
your
play
to
the
allowance
of
poetry
the
thing
drags
all
through
you
ve
got
a
big
idea
but
it
s
not
out
of
swaddling
clothes
if
this
was
your
first
play
i
d
say
but
it
has
been
just
the
same
with
all
the
others
you
ve
shown
me
and
you
remember
the
result
of
the
lee
shore
where
you
carried
all
the
expenses
of
production
yourself
and
we
couldn
t
fill
the
theatre
for
a
week
yet
the
lee
shore
was
a
modern
problem
play
much
easier
to
swing
than
blank
verse
it
isn
t
as
if
you
hadn
t
tried
all
kinds
granice
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
carefully
back
into
the
envelope
why
on
earth
was
he
it
when
he
knew
every
phrase
in
it
by
heart
when
for
a
month
past
he
had
seen
it
night
after
night
stand
out
in
letters
of
flame
against
the
darkness
of
his
sleepless
lids
has
been
just
the
same
with
all
the
others
you
ve
shown
that
was
the
way
they
dismissed
ten
years
of
passionate
unremitting
work
remember
the
result
of
the
lee
good
god
as
if
he
were
likely
to
forget
it
he
it
all
now
in
a
drowning
flash
the
persistent
rejection
of
the
play
his
sudden
resolve
to
put
it
on
at
his
own
cost
to
spend
ten
thousand
dollars
of
his
inheritance
on
testing
his
chance
of
success
the
fever
of
preparation
the
agony
of
the
first
night
the
flat
fall
the
stupid
press
his
secret
rush
to
europe
to
escape
the
condolence
of
his
friends
isn
t
as
if
you
hadn
t
tried
all
no
he
had
tried
all
kinds
comedy
tragedy
prose
and
verse
the
light
the
short
sharp
drama
the
and
the
finally
deciding
that
he
would
no
longer
prostitute
his
talent
to
win
popularity
but
would
impose
on
the
public
his
own
theory
of
art
in
the
form
of
five
acts
of
blank
verse
yes
he
had
offered
them
everything
and
always
with
the
same
result
ten
years
of
it
ten
years
of
dogged
work
and
unrelieved
failure
the
ten
years
from
forty
to
fifty
the
best
ten
years
of
his
life
and
if
one
counted
the
years
before
the
silent
years
of
dreams
assimilation
preparation
then
call
it
half
a
man
s
half
a
man
s
thrown
away
and
what
was
he
to
do
with
the
remaining
half
well
he
had
settled
that
thank
god
he
turned
and
glanced
anxiously
at
the
clock
ten
minutes
past
eight
only
ten
minutes
had
been
consumed
in
that
stormy
rush
through
his
whole
past
and
he
must
wait
another
twenty
minutes
for
ascham
it
was
one
of
the
worst
symptoms
of
his
case
that
in
proportion
as
he
had
grown
to
shrink
from
human
company
he
dreaded
more
and
more
to
be
alone
but
why
the
devil
was
he
waiting
for
ascham
why
didn
t
he
cut
the
knot
himself
since
he
was
so
unutterably
sick
of
the
whole
business
why
did
he
have
to
call
in
an
outsider
to
rid
him
of
this
nightmare
of
living
he
opened
the
drawer
again
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
revolver
it
was
a
small
slim
ivory
toy
just
the
instrument
for
a
tired
sufferer
to
give
himself
a
hypodermic
with
granice
raised
it
slowly
in
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
felt
under
the
thin
hair
at
the
back
of
his
head
between
the
ear
and
the
nape
he
knew
just
where
to
place
the
muzzle
he
had
once
got
a
young
surgeon
to
show
him
and
as
he
found
the
spot
and
lifted
the
revolver
to
it
the
inevitable
phenomenon
occurred
the
hand
that
held
the
weapon
began
to
shake
the
tremor
communicated
itself
to
his
arm
his
heart
gave
a
wild
leap
which
sent
up
a
wave
of
deadly
nausea
to
his
throat
he
smelt
the
powder
he
sickened
at
the
crash
of
the
bullet
through
his
skull
and
a
sweat
of
fear
broke
out
over
his
forehead
and
ran
down
his
quivering
face
he
laid
away
the
revolver
with
an
oath
and
pulling
out
a
handkerchief
passed
it
tremulously
over
his
brow
and
temples
it
was
no
use
he
knew
he
could
never
do
it
in
that
way
his
attempts
at
were
as
futile
as
his
snatches
at
fame
he
couldn
t
make
himself
a
real
life
and
he
couldn
t
get
rid
of
the
life
he
had
and
that
was
why
he
had
sent
for
ascham
to
help
him
the
lawyer
over
the
camembert
and
burgundy
began
to
excuse
himself
for
his
delay
i
didn
t
like
to
say
anything
while
your
man
was
about
but
the
fact
is
i
was
sent
for
on
a
rather
unusual
matter
oh
it
s
all
right
said
granice
cheerfully
he
was
beginning
to
feel
the
usual
reaction
that
food
and
company
produced
it
was
not
any
recovered
pleasure
in
life
that
he
felt
but
only
a
deeper
withdrawal
into
himself
it
was
easier
to
go
on
automatically
with
the
social
gestures
than
to
uncover
to
any
human
eye
the
abyss
within
him
my
dear
fellow
it
s
sacrilege
to
keep
a
dinner
waiting
especially
the
production
of
an
artist
like
ascham
sipped
his
burgundy
luxuriously
but
the
fact
is
ashgrove
sent
for
granice
raised
his
head
with
a
quick
movement
of
surprise
for
a
moment
he
was
shaken
out
of
his
ashgrove
ascham
smiled
i
thought
you
d
be
interested
i
know
your
passion
for
and
this
promises
to
be
one
of
course
it
s
out
of
our
line
entirely
we
never
touch
criminal
cases
but
she
wanted
to
consult
me
as
a
friend
ashgrove
was
a
distant
connection
of
my
wife
s
and
by
jove
it
a
queer
case
the
servant
and
ascham
snapped
his
lips
shut
would
the
gentlemen
have
their
coffee
in
the
no
serve
it
in
the
library
said
granice
rising
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
curtained
confidential
room
he
was
really
curious
to
hear
what
ascham
had
to
tell
him
while
the
coffee
and
cigars
were
being
served
he
fidgeted
about
the
library
glancing
at
his
letters
the
usual
meaningless
notes
and
bills
and
picking
up
the
evening
paper
as
he
unfolded
it
a
headline
caught
his
eye
rose
melrose
wants
to
play
poetry
thinks
she
has
found
her
he
read
on
with
a
thumping
heart
found
the
name
of
a
young
author
he
had
barely
heard
of
saw
the
title
of
a
play
a
poetic
drama
dance
before
his
eyes
and
dropped
the
paper
sick
disgusted
it
was
true
then
she
game
it
was
not
the
manner
but
the
matter
she
mistrusted
granice
turned
to
the
servant
who
seemed
to
be
purposely
lingering
i
shan
t
need
you
this
evening
flint
i
ll
lock
up
he
fancied
the
man
s
acquiescence
implied
surprise
what
was
going
on
flint
seemed
to
wonder
that
granice
should
want
him
out
of
the
way
probably
he
would
find
a
pretext
for
coming
back
to
see
granice
suddenly
felt
himself
enveloped
in
a
network
of
espionage
as
the
door
closed
he
threw
himself
into
an
armchair
and
leaned
forward
to
take
a
light
from
ascham
s
cigar
tell
me
about
ashgrove
he
said
seeming
to
himself
to
speak
stiffly
as
if
his
lips
were
cracked
mrs
ashgrove
well
there
s
not
much
to
and
you
couldn
t
if
there
were
granice
smiled
probably
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
wanted
my
advice
about
her
choice
of
counsel
there
was
nothing
especially
confidential
in
our
and
what
s
your
impression
now
you
ve
seen
her
my
impression
is
very
distinctly
nothing
will
ever
be
ah
granice
murmured
puffing
at
his
cigar
i
m
more
and
more
convinced
that
whoever
poisoned
ashgrove
knew
his
business
and
will
consequently
never
be
found
out
that
s
a
capital
cigar
you
ve
given
you
like
it
i
get
them
over
from
granice
examined
his
own
reflectively
then
you
believe
in
the
theory
that
the
clever
criminals
never
caught
of
course
i
do
look
about
you
look
back
for
the
last
dozen
years
none
of
the
big
murder
problems
are
ever
the
lawyer
ruminated
behind
his
blue
cloud
why
take
the
instance
in
your
own
family
i
d
forgotten
i
had
an
illustration
at
hand
take
old
joseph
lenman
s
murder
do
you
suppose
that
will
ever
be
explained
as
the
words
dropped
from
ascham
s
lips
his
host
looked
slowly
about
the
library
and
every
object
in
it
stared
back
at
him
with
a
stale
unescapable
familiarity
how
sick
he
was
of
looking
at
that
room
it
was
as
dull
as
the
face
of
a
wife
one
has
wearied
of
he
cleared
his
throat
slowly
then
he
turned
his
head
to
the
lawyer
and
said
i
could
explain
the
lenman
murder
ascham
s
eye
kindled
he
shared
granice
s
interest
in
criminal
cases
by
jove
you
ve
had
a
theory
all
this
time
it
s
odd
you
never
mentioned
it
go
ahead
and
tell
me
there
are
certain
features
in
the
lenman
case
not
unlike
this
ashgrove
affair
and
your
idea
may
be
a
granice
paused
and
his
eye
reverted
instinctively
to
the
table
drawer
in
which
the
revolver
and
the
manuscript
lay
side
by
side
what
if
he
were
to
try
another
appeal
to
rose
melrose
then
he
looked
at
the
notes
and
bills
on
the
table
and
the
horror
of
taking
up
again
the
lifeless
routine
of
life
of
performing
the
same
automatic
gestures
another
day
displaced
his
fleeting
vision
i
haven
t
a
theory
i
who
murdered
joseph
ascham
settled
himself
comfortably
in
his
chair
prepared
for
enjoyment
you
well
who
did
he
laughed
i
did
said
granice
rising
he
stood
before
ascham
and
the
lawyer
lay
back
staring
up
at
him
then
he
broke
into
another
laugh
why
this
is
glorious
you
murdered
him
did
you
to
inherit
his
money
i
suppose
better
and
better
go
on
my
boy
unbosom
yourself
tell
me
all
about
it
confession
is
good
for
the
granice
waited
till
the
lawyer
had
shaken
the
last
peal
of
laughter
from
his
throat
then
he
repeated
doggedly
i
murdered
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
for
a
long
moment
and
this
time
ascham
did
not
laugh
granice
i
murdered
him
to
get
his
money
as
you
there
was
another
pause
and
granice
with
a
vague
underlying
sense
of
amusement
saw
his
guest
s
look
change
from
pleasantry
to
apprehension
what
s
the
joke
my
dear
fellow
i
fail
to
it
s
not
a
joke
it
s
the
truth
i
murdered
he
had
spoken
painfully
at
first
as
if
there
were
a
knot
in
his
throat
but
each
time
he
repeated
the
words
he
found
they
were
easier
to
say
ascham
laid
down
his
extinct
cigar
what
s
the
matter
aren
t
you
well
what
on
earth
are
you
driving
at
i
m
perfectly
well
but
i
murdered
my
cousin
joseph
lenman
and
i
want
it
known
that
i
murdered
want
it
known
yes
that
s
why
i
sent
for
you
i
m
sick
of
living
and
when
i
try
to
kill
myself
i
funk
he
spoke
quite
naturally
now
as
if
the
knot
in
his
throat
had
been
untied
good
lord
good
lord
the
lawyer
gasped
but
i
suppose
granice
continued
there
s
no
doubt
this
would
be
murder
in
the
first
degree
i
m
sure
of
the
chair
if
i
own
up
ascham
drew
a
long
breath
then
he
said
slowly
sit
down
granice
let
s
ii
granice
told
his
story
simply
connectedly
he
began
by
a
quick
survey
of
his
early
years
the
years
of
drudgery
and
privation
his
father
a
charming
man
who
could
never
say
no
had
so
signally
failed
to
say
it
on
certain
essential
occasions
that
when
he
died
he
left
an
illegitimate
family
and
a
mortgaged
estate
his
lawful
kin
found
themselves
hanging
over
a
gulf
of
debt
and
young
granice
to
support
his
mother
and
sister
had
to
leave
harvard
and
bury
himself
at
eighteen
in
a
broker
s
office
he
loathed
his
work
and
he
was
always
poor
always
worried
and
in
a
few
years
later
his
mother
died
but
his
sister
an
ineffectual
neurasthenic
remained
on
his
hands
his
own
health
gave
out
and
he
had
to
go
away
for
six
months
and
work
harder
than
ever
when
he
came
back
he
had
no
knack
for
business
no
head
for
figures
no
dimmest
insight
into
the
mysteries
of
commerce
he
wanted
to
travel
and
write
those
were
his
inmost
longings
and
as
the
years
dragged
on
and
he
neared
without
making
any
more
money
or
acquiring
any
firmer
health
a
sick
despair
possessed
him
he
tried
writing
but
he
always
came
home
from
the
office
so
tired
that
his
brain
could
not
work
for
half
the
year
he
did
not
reach
his
dim
flat
till
after
dark
and
could
only
brush
up
for
dinner
and
afterward
lie
on
the
lounge
with
his
pipe
while
his
sister
droned
through
the
evening
paper
sometimes
he
spent
an
evening
at
the
theatre
or
he
dined
out
or
more
rarely
strayed
off
with
an
acquaintance
or
two
in
quest
of
what
is
known
as
and
in
summer
when
he
and
kate
went
to
the
for
a
month
he
dozed
through
the
days
in
utter
weariness
once
he
fell
in
love
with
a
charming
girl
but
what
had
he
to
offer
her
in
god
s
name
she
seemed
to
like
him
and
in
common
decency
he
had
to
drop
out
of
the
running
apparently
no
one
replaced
him
for
she
never
married
but
grew
stoutish
grayish
philanthropic
yet
how
sweet
she
had
been
when
he
had
first
kissed
her
one
more
wasted
life
he
reflected
but
the
stage
had
always
been
his
he
would
have
sold
his
soul
for
the
time
and
freedom
to
write
plays
it
was
he
could
not
remember
when
it
had
not
been
his
instinct
as
the
years
passed
it
became
a
morbid
a
relentless
obsession
yet
with
every
year
the
material
conditions
were
more
and
more
against
it
he
felt
himself
growing
and
he
watched
the
reflection
of
the
process
in
his
sister
s
wasted
face
at
eighteen
she
had
been
pretty
and
as
full
of
enthusiasm
as
he
now
she
was
sour
trivial
insignificant
she
had
missed
her
chance
of
life
and
she
had
no
resources
poor
creature
was
fashioned
simply
for
the
primitive
functions
she
had
been
denied
the
chance
to
fulfil
it
exasperated
him
to
think
of
it
and
to
reflect
that
even
now
a
little
travel
a
little
health
a
little
money
might
transform
her
make
her
young
and
desirable
the
chief
fruit
of
his
experience
was
that
there
is
no
such
fixed
state
as
age
or
youth
there
is
only
health
as
against
sickness
wealth
as
against
poverty
and
age
or
youth
as
the
outcome
of
the
lot
one
draws
at
this
point
in
his
narrative
granice
stood
up
and
went
to
lean
against
the
looking
down
at
ascham
who
had
not
moved
from
his
seat
or
changed
his
attitude
of
rigid
fascinated
attention
then
came
the
summer
when
we
went
to
wrenfield
to
be
near
old
lenman
my
mother
s
cousin
as
you
know
some
of
the
family
always
mounted
guard
over
him
generally
a
niece
or
so
but
that
year
they
were
all
scattered
and
one
of
the
nieces
offered
to
lend
us
her
cottage
if
we
d
relieve
her
of
duty
for
two
months
it
was
a
nuisance
for
me
of
course
for
wrenfield
is
two
hours
from
town
but
my
mother
who
was
a
slave
to
family
observances
had
always
been
good
to
the
old
man
so
it
was
natural
we
should
be
called
on
and
there
was
the
saving
of
rent
and
the
good
air
for
kate
so
we
went
you
never
knew
joseph
lenman
well
picture
to
yourself
an
amoeba
or
some
primitive
organism
of
that
sort
under
a
titan
s
microscope
he
was
large
undifferentiated
inert
since
i
could
remember
him
he
had
done
nothing
but
take
his
temperature
and
read
the
oh
and
cultivate
melons
that
was
his
hobby
not
vulgar
melons
his
were
grown
under
glass
he
had
miles
of
it
at
wrenfield
his
big
was
surrounded
by
blinking
battalions
of
and
in
nearly
all
of
them
melons
were
grown
early
melons
and
late
french
english
domestic
dwarf
melons
and
monsters
every
shape
colour
and
variety
they
were
petted
and
nursed
like
children
a
staff
of
trained
attendants
waited
on
them
i
m
not
sure
they
didn
t
have
a
doctor
to
take
their
temperature
at
any
rate
the
place
was
full
of
thermometers
and
they
didn
t
sprawl
on
the
ground
like
ordinary
melons
they
were
trained
against
the
glass
like
nectarines
and
each
melon
hung
in
a
net
which
sustained
its
weight
and
left
it
free
on
all
sides
to
the
sun
and
air
it
used
to
strike
me
sometimes
that
old
lenman
was
just
like
one
of
his
own
melons
the
english
kind
his
life
apathetic
and
motionless
hung
in
a
net
of
gold
in
an
equable
warm
ventilated
atmosphere
high
above
sordid
earthly
worries
the
cardinal
rule
of
his
existence
was
not
to
let
himself
be
i
remember
his
advising
me
to
try
it
myself
one
day
when
i
spoke
to
him
about
kate
s
bad
health
and
her
need
of
a
change
i
never
let
myself
worry
he
said
complacently
it
s
the
worst
thing
for
the
liver
and
you
look
to
me
as
if
you
had
a
liver
take
my
advice
and
be
cheerful
you
ll
make
yourself
happier
and
others
and
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
write
a
cheque
and
send
the
poor
girl
off
for
a
holiday
the
hardest
part
of
it
was
that
the
money
to
us
already
the
old
only
had
it
for
life
in
trust
for
us
and
the
others
but
his
life
was
a
good
deal
sounder
than
mine
or
kate
s
and
one
could
picture
him
taking
extra
care
of
it
for
the
joke
of
keeping
us
waiting
i
always
felt
that
the
sight
of
our
hungry
eyes
was
a
tonic
to
him
well
i
tried
to
see
if
i
couldn
t
reach
him
through
his
vanity
i
flattered
him
feigned
a
passionate
interest
in
his
melons
and
he
was
taken
in
and
used
to
discourse
on
them
by
the
hour
on
fine
days
he
was
driven
to
the
in
his
and
waddled
through
them
prodding
and
leering
at
the
fruit
like
a
fat
turk
in
his
seraglio
when
he
bragged
to
me
of
the
expense
of
growing
them
i
was
reminded
of
a
hideous
old
lothario
bragging
of
what
his
pleasures
cost
and
the
resemblance
was
completed
by
the
fact
that
he
couldn
t
eat
as
much
as
a
mouthful
of
his
melons
had
lived
for
years
on
buttermilk
and
toast
but
after
all
it
s
my
only
hobby
why
shouldn
t
i
indulge
it
he
said
sentimentally
as
if
i
d
ever
been
able
to
indulge
any
of
mine
on
the
keep
of
those
melons
kate
and
i
could
have
lived
like
gods
one
day
toward
the
end
of
the
summer
when
kate
was
too
unwell
to
drag
herself
up
to
the
big
house
she
asked
me
to
go
and
spend
the
afternoon
with
cousin
joseph
it
was
a
lovely
soft
september
afternoon
a
day
to
lie
under
a
roman
with
one
s
eyes
on
the
sky
and
let
the
cosmic
harmonies
rush
through
one
perhaps
the
vision
was
suggested
by
the
fact
that
as
i
entered
cousin
joseph
s
hideous
black
walnut
library
i
passed
one
of
the
a
handsome
italian
who
dashed
out
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
nearly
knocked
me
down
i
remember
thinking
it
queer
that
the
fellow
whom
i
had
often
seen
about
the
did
not
bow
to
me
or
even
seem
to
see
me
cousin
joseph
sat
in
his
usual
seat
behind
the
darkened
windows
his
fat
hands
folded
on
his
protuberant
waistcoat
the
last
number
of
the
at
his
elbow
and
near
it
on
a
huge
dish
a
fat
melon
the
fattest
melon
i
d
ever
seen
as
i
looked
at
it
i
pictured
the
ecstasy
of
contemplation
from
which
i
must
have
roused
him
and
congratulated
myself
on
finding
him
in
such
a
mood
since
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
him
a
favour
then
i
noticed
that
his
face
instead
of
looking
as
calm
as
an
was
distorted
and
whimpering
and
without
stopping
to
greet
me
he
pointed
passionately
to
the
melon
look
at
it
look
at
it
did
you
ever
see
such
a
beauty
such
firmness
roundness
such
delicious
smoothness
to
the
touch
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
she
instead
of
it
and
when
he
put
out
his
senile
hand
and
touched
the
melon
i
positively
had
to
look
the
other
way
then
he
told
me
what
had
happened
the
italian
who
had
been
specially
recommended
for
the
though
it
was
against
my
cousin
s
principles
to
employ
a
papist
had
been
assigned
to
the
care
of
the
monster
for
it
had
revealed
itself
early
in
its
existence
as
destined
to
become
a
monster
to
surpass
its
plumpest
pulpiest
sisters
carry
off
prizes
at
agricultural
shows
and
be
photographed
and
celebrated
in
every
gardening
paper
in
the
land
the
italian
had
done
well
seemed
to
have
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
that
very
morning
he
had
been
ordered
to
pick
the
melon
which
was
to
be
shown
next
day
at
the
county
fair
and
to
bring
it
in
for
lenman
to
gaze
on
its
blonde
virginity
but
in
picking
it
what
had
the
damned
scoundrelly
jesuit
done
but
drop
it
drop
it
crash
on
the
sharp
spout
of
a
so
that
it
received
a
deep
gash
in
its
firm
pale
rotundity
and
was
henceforth
but
a
bruised
ruined
fallen
melon
the
old
man
s
rage
was
fearful
in
its
impotence
he
shook
spluttered
and
strangled
with
it
he
had
just
had
the
italian
up
and
had
sacked
him
on
the
spot
without
wages
or
character
had
threatened
to
have
him
arrested
if
he
was
ever
caught
prowling
about
wrenfield
by
god
and
i
ll
do
it
i
ll
write
to
washington
i
ll
have
the
pauper
scoundrel
deported
i
ll
show
him
what
money
can
do
as
likely
as
not
there
was
some
murderous
business
under
it
it
would
be
found
that
the
fellow
was
a
member
of
a
those
italians
would
murder
you
for
a
quarter
he
meant
to
have
the
police
look
into
it
and
then
he
grew
frightened
at
his
own
excitement
but
i
must
calm
myself
he
said
he
took
his
temperature
rang
for
his
drops
and
turned
to
the
he
had
been
reading
an
article
on
nestorianism
when
the
melon
was
brought
in
he
asked
me
to
go
on
with
it
and
i
read
to
him
for
an
hour
in
the
dim
close
room
with
a
fat
fly
buzzing
stealthily
about
the
fallen
melon
all
the
while
one
phrase
of
the
old
man
s
buzzed
in
my
brain
like
the
fly
about
the
melon
ll
show
him
what
money
can
do
good
heaven
if
could
but
show
the
old
man
if
i
could
make
him
see
his
power
of
giving
happiness
as
a
new
outlet
for
his
monstrous
egotism
i
tried
to
tell
him
something
about
my
situation
and
kate
s
spoke
of
my
my
unsuccessful
drudgery
my
longing
to
write
to
make
myself
a
name
i
stammered
out
an
entreaty
for
a
loan
i
can
guarantee
to
repay
you
sir
i
ve
a
play
as
security
i
shall
never
forget
his
glassy
stare
his
face
had
grown
as
smooth
as
an
again
his
eyes
peered
over
his
fat
cheeks
like
sentinels
over
a
slippery
rampart
a
play
a
play
of
as
security
he
looked
at
me
almost
fearfully
as
if
detecting
the
first
symptoms
of
insanity
do
you
understand
anything
of
business
he
enquired
mildly
i
laughed
and
answered
no
not
he
leaned
back
with
closed
lids
all
this
excitement
has
been
too
much
for
me
he
said
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
ll
prepare
for
my
and
i
stumbled
out
of
the
room
blindly
like
the
granice
moved
away
from
the
and
walked
across
to
the
tray
set
out
with
decanters
and
he
poured
himself
a
tall
glass
of
emptied
it
and
glanced
at
ascham
s
dead
cigar
better
light
another
he
suggested
the
lawyer
shook
his
head
and
granice
went
on
with
his
tale
he
told
of
his
mounting
obsession
how
the
murderous
impulse
had
waked
in
him
on
the
instant
of
his
cousin
s
refusal
and
he
had
muttered
to
himself
by
god
if
you
won
t
i
ll
make
he
spoke
more
tranquilly
as
the
narrative
proceeded
as
though
his
rage
had
died
down
once
the
resolve
to
act
on
it
was
taken
he
applied
his
whole
mind
to
the
question
of
how
the
old
man
was
to
be
disposed
suddenly
he
remembered
the
outcry
those
italians
will
murder
you
for
a
quarter
but
no
definite
project
presented
itself
he
simply
waited
for
an
inspiration
granice
and
his
sister
moved
to
town
a
day
or
two
after
the
incident
of
the
melon
but
the
cousins
who
had
returned
kept
them
informed
of
the
old
man
s
condition
one
day
about
three
weeks
later
granice
on
getting
home
found
kate
excited
over
a
report
from
wrenfield
the
italian
had
been
there
again
had
somehow
slipped
into
the
house
made
his
way
up
to
the
library
and
used
threatening
the
found
cousin
joseph
gasping
the
whites
of
his
eyes
showing
something
the
doctor
was
sent
for
and
the
attack
warded
off
and
the
police
had
ordered
the
italian
from
the
neighbourhood
but
cousin
joseph
thereafter
languished
had
nerves
and
lost
his
taste
for
toast
and
the
doctor
called
in
a
colleague
and
the
consultation
amused
and
excited
the
old
man
he
became
once
more
an
important
figure
the
medical
men
reassured
the
family
too
completely
and
to
the
patient
they
recommended
a
more
varied
diet
advised
him
to
take
whatever
tempted
and
so
one
day
tremulously
prayerfully
he
decided
on
a
tiny
bit
of
melon
it
was
brought
up
with
ceremony
and
consumed
in
the
presence
of
the
and
a
hovering
cousin
and
twenty
minutes
later
he
was
dead
but
you
remember
the
circumstances
granice
went
on
how
suspicion
turned
at
once
on
the
italian
in
spite
of
the
hint
the
police
had
given
him
he
had
been
seen
hanging
about
the
house
since
the
it
was
said
that
he
had
tender
relations
with
the
and
the
rest
seemed
easy
to
explain
but
when
they
looked
round
to
ask
him
for
the
explanation
he
was
gone
gone
clean
out
of
sight
he
had
been
warned
to
leave
wrenfield
and
he
had
taken
the
warning
so
to
heart
that
no
one
ever
laid
eyes
on
him
granice
paused
he
had
dropped
into
a
chair
opposite
the
lawyer
s
and
he
sat
for
a
moment
his
head
thrown
back
looking
about
the
familiar
room
everything
in
it
had
grown
grimacing
and
alien
and
each
strange
insistent
object
seemed
craning
forward
from
its
place
to
hear
him
it
was
i
who
put
the
stuff
in
the
melon
he
said
and
i
don
t
want
you
to
think
i
m
sorry
for
it
this
isn
t
remorse
understand
i
m
glad
the
old
is
dead
i
m
glad
the
others
have
their
money
but
mine
s
no
use
to
me
any
more
my
sister
married
miserably
and
died
and
i
ve
never
had
what
i
ascham
continued
to
stare
then
he
said
what
on
earth
was
your
object
then
why
to
what
i
wanted
what
i
fancied
was
in
reach
i
wanted
change
rest
for
both
of
us
wanted
above
all
for
myself
the
chance
to
write
i
travelled
got
back
my
health
and
came
home
to
tie
myself
up
to
my
work
and
i
ve
slaved
at
it
steadily
for
ten
years
without
reward
without
the
most
distant
hope
of
success
nobody
will
look
at
my
stuff
and
now
i
m
fifty
and
i
m
beaten
and
i
know
his
chin
dropped
forward
on
his
breast
i
want
to
chuck
the
whole
business
he
ended
iii
it
was
after
midnight
when
ascham
left
his
hand
on
granice
s
shoulder
as
he
turned
to
go
district
attorney
be
hanged
see
a
doctor
see
a
doctor
he
had
cried
and
so
with
an
exaggerated
laugh
had
pulled
on
his
coat
and
departed
granice
turned
back
into
the
library
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
ascham
would
not
believe
his
story
for
three
hours
he
had
explained
elucidated
patiently
and
painfully
gone
over
every
detail
but
without
once
breaking
down
the
iron
incredulity
of
the
lawyer
s
eye
at
first
ascham
had
feigned
to
be
convinced
but
that
as
granice
now
perceived
was
simply
to
get
him
to
expose
himself
to
entrap
him
into
contradictions
and
when
the
attempt
failed
when
granice
triumphantly
met
and
refuted
each
disconcerting
question
the
lawyer
dropped
the
mask
suddenly
and
said
with
a
laugh
by
jove
granice
you
ll
write
a
successful
play
yet
the
way
you
ve
worked
this
all
out
is
a
granice
swung
about
furiously
that
last
sneer
about
the
play
inflamed
him
was
all
the
world
in
a
conspiracy
to
deride
his
failure
i
did
it
i
did
it
he
muttered
sullenly
his
rage
spending
itself
against
the
impenetrable
surface
of
the
other
s
mockery
and
ascham
answered
with
a
smile
ever
read
any
of
those
books
on
hallucination
i
ve
got
a
fairly
good
library
i
could
send
you
one
or
two
if
you
like
left
alone
granice
cowered
down
in
the
chair
before
his
he
understood
that
ascham
thought
him
off
his
head
good
god
what
if
they
all
think
me
crazy
the
horror
of
it
broke
out
over
him
in
a
cold
sweat
he
sat
there
and
shook
his
eyes
hidden
in
his
icy
hands
but
gradually
as
he
began
to
rehearse
his
story
for
the
thousandth
time
he
saw
again
how
incontrovertible
it
was
and
felt
sure
that
any
criminal
lawyer
would
believe
him
that
s
the
trouble
ascham
s
not
a
criminal
lawyer
and
then
he
s
a
friend
what
a
fool
i
was
to
talk
to
a
friend
even
if
he
did
believe
me
he
d
never
let
me
see
it
his
instinct
would
be
to
cover
the
whole
thing
up
but
in
that
case
if
he
believe
me
he
might
think
it
a
kindness
to
get
me
shut
up
in
an
asylum
granice
began
to
tremble
again
good
heaven
if
he
should
bring
in
an
expert
one
of
those
damned
alienists
ascham
and
pettilow
can
do
anything
their
word
always
goes
if
ascham
drops
a
hint
that
i
d
better
be
shut
up
i
ll
be
in
a
by
and
he
d
do
it
from
the
kindest
motives
be
quite
right
to
do
it
if
he
thinks
i
m
a
murderer
the
vision
froze
him
to
his
chair
he
pressed
his
fists
to
his
bursting
temples
and
tried
to
think
for
the
first
time
he
hoped
that
ascham
had
not
believed
his
story
but
he
did
he
did
i
can
see
it
now
i
noticed
what
a
queer
eye
he
cocked
at
me
good
god
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
he
started
up
and
looked
at
the
clock
one
what
if
ascham
should
think
the
case
urgent
rout
out
an
alienist
and
come
back
with
him
granice
jumped
to
his
feet
and
his
sudden
gesture
brushed
the
morning
paper
from
the
table
mechanically
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
and
the
movement
started
a
new
train
of
association
he
sat
down
again
and
reached
for
the
telephone
book
in
the
rack
by
his
chair
give
me
the
new
idea
in
his
mind
had
revived
his
flagging
energy
he
would
act
act
at
once
it
was
only
by
thus
planning
ahead
committing
himself
to
some
unavoidable
line
of
conduct
that
he
could
pull
himself
through
the
meaningless
days
each
time
he
reached
a
fresh
decision
it
was
like
coming
out
of
a
foggy
weltering
sea
into
a
calm
harbour
with
lights
one
of
the
queerest
phases
of
his
long
agony
was
the
intense
relief
produced
by
these
momentary
lulls
that
the
office
of
the
yes
give
me
denver
please
hallo
denver
yes
hubert
granice
just
caught
you
going
straight
home
can
i
come
and
see
you
yes
now
have
a
talk
it
s
rather
urgent
yes
might
give
you
some
all
right
he
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
laugh
it
had
been
a
happy
thought
to
call
up
the
editor
of
the
robert
denver
was
the
very
man
he
needed
granice
put
out
the
lights
in
the
library
it
was
odd
how
the
automatic
gestures
persisted
went
into
the
hall
put
on
his
hat
and
overcoat
and
let
himself
out
of
the
flat
in
the
hall
a
sleepy
elevator
boy
blinked
at
him
and
then
dropped
his
head
on
his
folded
arms
granice
passed
out
into
the
street
at
the
corner
of
fifth
avenue
he
hailed
a
crawling
cab
and
called
out
an
address
the
long
thoroughfare
stretched
before
him
dim
and
deserted
like
an
ancient
avenue
of
tombs
but
from
denver
s
house
a
friendly
beam
fell
on
the
pavement
and
as
granice
sprang
from
his
cab
the
editor
s
electric
turned
the
corner
the
two
men
grasped
hands
and
denver
feeling
for
his
ushered
granice
into
the
hall
disturb
me
not
a
bit
you
might
have
at
ten
morning
but
this
is
my
liveliest
hour
you
know
my
habits
of
granice
had
known
robert
denver
for
fifteen
years
watched
his
rise
through
all
the
stages
of
journalism
to
the
olympian
pinnacle
of
the
editorial
office
in
the
man
with
grizzling
hair
there
were
few
traces
left
of
the
young
reporter
who
on
his
way
home
in
the
small
hours
used
to
bob
in
on
granice
while
the
latter
sat
grinding
at
his
plays
denver
had
to
pass
granice
s
flat
on
the
way
to
his
own
and
it
became
a
habit
if
he
saw
a
light
in
the
window
and
granice
s
shadow
against
the
blind
to
go
in
smoke
a
pipe
and
discuss
the
universe
well
this
is
like
old
times
a
good
old
habit
the
editor
smote
his
visitor
genially
on
the
shoulder
reminds
me
of
the
nights
when
i
used
to
rout
you
out
how
s
the
play
by
the
way
there
a
play
i
suppose
it
s
as
safe
to
ask
you
that
as
to
say
to
some
men
how
s
the
baby
denver
laughed
and
granice
thought
how
thick
and
heavy
he
had
grown
it
was
evident
even
to
granice
s
tortured
nerves
that
the
words
had
not
been
uttered
in
malice
and
the
fact
gave
him
a
new
measure
of
his
insignificance
denver
did
not
even
know
that
he
had
been
a
failure
the
fact
hurt
more
than
ascham
s
irony
come
in
come
the
editor
led
the
way
into
a
small
cheerful
room
where
there
were
cigars
and
decanters
he
pushed
an
toward
his
visitor
and
dropped
into
another
with
a
comfortable
groan
now
then
help
yourself
and
let
s
hear
all
about
he
beamed
at
granice
over
his
and
the
latter
lighting
his
cigar
said
to
himself
success
makes
men
comfortable
but
it
makes
them
then
he
turned
and
began
denver
i
want
to
tell
you
the
clock
ticked
rhythmically
on
the
the
room
was
gradually
filled
with
drifting
blue
layers
of
smoke
and
through
them
the
editor
s
face
came
and
went
like
the
moon
through
a
moving
sky
once
the
hour
struck
then
the
rhythmical
ticking
began
again
the
atmosphere
grew
denser
and
heavier
and
beads
of
perspiration
began
to
roll
from
granice
s
forehead
do
you
mind
if
i
open
the
window
no
it
stuffy
in
here
wait
i
ll
do
it
denver
pushed
down
the
upper
sash
and
returned
to
his
chair
well
go
on
he
said
filling
another
pipe
his
composure
exasperated
granice
there
s
no
use
in
my
going
on
if
you
don
t
believe
the
editor
remained
unmoved
who
says
i
don
t
believe
you
and
how
can
i
tell
till
you
ve
finished
granice
went
on
ashamed
of
his
outburst
it
was
simple
enough
as
you
ll
see
from
the
day
the
old
man
said
to
me
those
italians
would
murder
you
for
a
quarter
i
dropped
everything
and
just
worked
at
my
scheme
it
struck
me
at
once
that
i
must
find
a
way
of
getting
to
wrenfield
and
back
in
a
night
and
that
led
to
the
idea
of
a
motor
a
motor
that
never
occurred
to
you
you
wonder
where
i
got
the
money
i
suppose
well
i
had
a
thousand
or
so
put
by
and
i
nosed
around
till
i
found
what
i
wanted
a
racer
i
knew
how
to
drive
a
car
and
i
tried
the
thing
and
found
it
was
all
right
times
were
bad
and
i
bought
it
for
my
price
and
stored
it
away
where
why
in
one
of
those
garages
where
they
keep
motors
that
are
not
for
family
use
i
had
a
lively
cousin
who
had
put
me
up
to
that
dodge
and
i
looked
about
till
i
found
a
queer
hole
where
they
took
in
my
car
like
a
baby
in
a
foundling
asylum
then
i
practiced
running
to
wrenfield
and
back
in
a
night
i
knew
the
way
pretty
well
for
i
d
done
it
often
with
the
same
lively
cousin
and
in
the
small
hours
too
the
distance
is
over
ninety
miles
and
on
the
third
trial
i
did
it
under
two
hours
but
my
arms
were
so
lame
that
i
could
hardly
get
dressed
the
next
morning
well
then
came
the
report
about
the
italian
s
threats
and
i
saw
i
must
act
at
once
i
meant
to
break
into
the
old
man
s
room
shoot
him
and
get
away
again
it
was
a
big
risk
but
i
thought
i
could
manage
it
then
we
heard
that
he
was
ill
that
there
d
been
a
consultation
perhaps
the
fates
were
going
to
do
it
for
me
good
lord
if
that
could
only
be
granice
stopped
and
wiped
his
forehead
the
open
window
did
not
seem
to
have
cooled
the
room
then
came
word
that
he
was
better
and
the
day
after
when
i
came
up
from
my
office
i
found
kate
laughing
over
the
news
that
he
was
to
try
a
bit
of
melon
the
had
just
telephoned
her
all
wrenfield
was
in
a
flutter
the
doctor
himself
had
picked
out
the
melon
one
of
the
little
french
ones
that
are
hardly
bigger
than
a
large
tomato
and
the
patient
was
to
eat
it
at
his
breakfast
the
next
morning
in
a
flash
i
saw
my
chance
it
was
a
bare
chance
no
more
but
i
knew
the
ways
of
the
house
i
was
sure
the
melon
would
be
brought
in
over
night
and
put
in
the
pantry
if
there
were
only
one
melon
in
the
i
could
be
fairly
sure
it
was
the
one
i
wanted
melons
didn
t
lie
around
loose
in
that
house
every
one
was
known
numbered
catalogued
the
old
man
was
beset
by
the
dread
that
the
servants
would
eat
them
and
he
took
a
hundred
mean
precautions
to
prevent
it
yes
i
felt
pretty
sure
of
my
melon
and
poisoning
was
much
safer
than
shooting
it
would
have
been
the
devil
and
all
to
get
into
the
old
man
s
bedroom
without
his
rousing
the
house
but
i
ought
to
be
able
to
break
into
the
pantry
without
much
trouble
it
was
a
cloudy
night
too
everything
served
me
i
dined
quietly
and
sat
down
at
my
desk
kate
had
one
of
her
usual
headaches
and
went
to
bed
early
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
i
slipped
out
i
had
got
together
a
sort
of
disguise
red
beard
and
ulster
i
shoved
them
into
a
bag
and
went
round
to
the
garage
there
was
no
one
there
but
a
machinist
whom
i
d
never
seen
before
that
served
me
too
they
were
always
changing
machinists
and
this
new
fellow
didn
t
even
bother
to
ask
if
the
car
belonged
to
me
it
was
a
very
place
well
i
jumped
in
ran
up
broadway
and
let
the
car
go
as
soon
as
i
was
out
of
harlem
dark
as
it
was
i
could
trust
myself
to
strike
a
sharp
pace
in
the
shadow
of
a
wood
i
stopped
a
second
and
got
into
the
beard
and
ulster
then
away
again
it
was
just
when
i
got
to
wrenfield
i
left
the
car
in
a
dark
lane
behind
the
lenman
place
and
slipped
through
the
the
winked
at
me
through
the
dark
i
remember
thinking
that
they
knew
what
i
wanted
to
know
by
the
stable
a
dog
came
out
growling
but
he
nosed
me
out
jumped
on
me
and
went
back
the
house
was
as
dark
as
the
grave
i
knew
everybody
went
to
bed
by
ten
but
there
might
be
a
prowling
servant
the
might
have
come
down
to
let
in
her
italian
i
had
to
risk
that
of
course
i
crept
around
by
the
back
door
and
hid
in
the
shrubbery
then
i
listened
it
was
all
as
silent
as
death
i
crossed
over
to
the
house
pried
open
the
pantry
window
and
climbed
in
i
had
a
little
electric
lamp
in
my
pocket
and
shielding
it
with
my
cap
i
groped
my
way
to
the
opened
it
and
there
was
the
little
french
melon
only
one
i
stopped
to
listen
i
was
quite
cool
then
i
pulled
out
my
bottle
of
stuff
and
my
syringe
and
gave
each
section
of
the
melon
a
hypodermic
it
was
all
done
inside
of
three
minutes
at
ten
minutes
to
twelve
i
was
back
in
the
car
i
got
out
of
the
lane
as
quietly
as
i
could
struck
a
back
road
that
skirted
the
village
and
let
the
car
out
as
soon
as
i
was
beyond
the
last
houses
i
only
stopped
once
on
the
way
in
to
drop
the
beard
and
ulster
into
a
pond
i
had
a
big
stone
ready
to
weight
them
with
and
they
went
down
plump
like
a
dead
body
and
at
two
o
clock
i
was
back
at
my
granice
stopped
speaking
and
looked
across
the
at
his
listener
but
denver
s
face
remained
inscrutable
at
length
he
said
why
did
you
want
to
tell
me
this
the
question
startled
granice
he
was
about
to
explain
as
he
had
explained
to
ascham
but
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
his
motive
had
not
seemed
convincing
to
the
lawyer
it
would
carry
much
less
weight
with
denver
both
were
successful
men
and
success
does
not
understand
the
subtle
agony
of
failure
granice
cast
about
for
another
reason
why
i
the
thing
haunts
me
remorse
i
suppose
you
d
call
it
denver
struck
the
ashes
from
his
empty
pipe
remorse
bosh
he
said
energetically
granice
s
heart
sank
you
don
t
believe
in
not
an
atom
in
the
man
of
action
the
mere
fact
of
your
talking
of
remorse
proves
to
me
that
you
re
not
the
man
to
have
planned
and
put
through
such
a
granice
groaned
well
i
lied
to
you
about
remorse
i
ve
never
felt
denver
s
lips
tightened
sceptically
about
his
pipe
what
was
your
motive
then
you
must
have
had
i
ll
tell
you
and
granice
began
again
to
rehearse
the
story
of
his
failure
of
his
loathing
for
life
don
t
say
you
don
t
believe
me
this
time
that
this
isn
t
a
real
reason
he
stammered
out
piteously
as
he
ended
denver
meditated
no
i
won
t
say
that
i
ve
seen
too
many
queer
things
there
s
always
a
reason
for
wanting
to
get
out
of
life
the
wonder
is
that
we
find
so
many
for
staying
in
granice
s
heart
grew
light
then
you
believe
me
he
faltered
believe
that
you
re
sick
of
the
job
yes
and
that
you
haven
t
the
nerve
to
pull
the
trigger
oh
yes
that
s
easy
enough
too
but
all
that
doesn
t
make
you
a
murderer
though
i
don
t
say
it
proves
you
could
never
have
been
i
been
one
denver
i
swear
to
he
meditated
just
tell
me
one
or
two
oh
go
ahead
you
won
t
stump
me
granice
heard
himself
say
with
a
laugh
well
how
did
you
make
all
those
trial
trips
without
exciting
your
sister
s
curiosity
i
knew
your
night
habits
pretty
well
at
that
time
remember
you
were
very
seldom
out
late
didn
t
the
change
in
your
ways
surprise
her
no
because
she
was
away
at
the
time
she
went
to
pay
several
visits
in
the
country
soon
after
we
came
back
from
wrenfield
and
was
only
in
town
for
a
night
or
two
before
before
i
did
the
and
that
night
she
went
to
bed
early
with
a
headache
yes
blinding
she
didn
t
know
anything
when
she
had
that
kind
and
her
room
was
at
the
back
of
the
denver
again
meditated
and
when
you
got
back
she
didn
t
hear
you
you
got
in
without
her
knowing
it
yes
i
went
straight
to
my
work
took
it
up
at
the
word
where
i
d
left
off
denver
don
t
you
remember
granice
suddenly
passionately
interjected
remember
yes
how
you
found
me
when
you
looked
in
that
morning
between
two
and
three
your
usual
hour
yes
the
editor
nodded
granice
gave
a
short
laugh
in
my
old
coat
with
my
pipe
looked
as
if
i
d
been
working
all
night
didn
t
i
well
i
hadn
t
been
in
my
chair
ten
minutes
denver
uncrossed
his
legs
and
then
crossed
them
again
i
didn
t
know
whether
remembered
what
my
coming
in
that
particular
night
or
granice
swung
round
in
his
chair
why
man
alive
that
s
why
i
m
here
now
because
it
was
you
who
spoke
for
me
at
the
inquest
when
they
looked
round
to
see
what
all
the
old
man
s
heirs
had
been
doing
that
night
you
who
testified
to
having
dropped
in
and
found
me
at
my
desk
as
usual
i
thought
would
appeal
to
your
journalistic
sense
if
nothing
else
would
denver
smiled
oh
my
journalistic
sense
is
still
susceptible
enough
and
the
idea
s
picturesque
i
grant
you
asking
the
man
who
proved
your
alibi
to
establish
your
that
s
it
that
s
it
granice
s
laugh
had
a
ring
of
triumph
well
but
how
about
the
other
chap
s
testimony
i
mean
that
young
doctor
what
was
his
name
ned
ranney
don
t
you
remember
my
testifying
that
i
d
met
him
at
the
elevated
station
and
told
him
i
was
on
my
way
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
you
and
his
saying
all
right
you
ll
find
him
in
i
passed
the
house
two
hours
ago
and
saw
his
shadow
against
the
blind
as
and
the
lady
with
the
toothache
in
the
flat
across
the
way
she
corroborated
his
statement
you
yes
i
well
then
simple
enough
before
starting
i
rigged
up
a
kind
of
mannikin
with
old
coats
and
a
cushion
something
to
cast
a
shadow
on
the
blind
all
you
fellows
were
used
to
seeing
my
shadow
there
in
the
small
hours
i
counted
on
that
and
knew
you
d
take
any
vague
outline
as
simple
enough
as
you
say
but
the
woman
with
the
toothache
saw
the
shadow
move
you
remember
she
said
she
saw
you
sink
forward
as
if
you
d
fallen
yes
and
she
was
right
it
move
i
suppose
some
dray
must
have
jolted
by
the
flimsy
building
at
any
rate
something
gave
my
mannikin
a
jar
and
when
i
came
back
he
had
sunk
forward
half
over
the
there
was
a
long
silence
between
the
two
men
granice
with
a
throbbing
heart
watched
denver
refill
his
pipe
the
editor
at
any
rate
did
not
sneer
and
flout
him
after
all
journalism
gave
a
deeper
insight
than
the
law
into
the
fantastic
possibilities
of
life
prepared
one
better
to
allow
for
the
incalculableness
of
human
impulses
well
granice
faltered
out
denver
stood
up
with
a
shrug
look
here
man
what
s
wrong
with
you
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
nerves
gone
to
smash
i
d
like
to
take
you
to
see
a
chap
i
know
an
who
s
a
wonder
at
pulling
fellows
in
your
state
out
of
their
hole
oh
oh
granice
broke
in
he
stood
up
also
and
the
two
men
eyed
each
other
you
don
t
believe
me
then
this
yarn
how
can
i
there
wasn
t
a
flaw
in
your
but
haven
t
i
filled
it
full
of
them
now
denver
shook
his
head
i
might
think
so
if
i
hadn
t
happened
to
know
that
you
to
there
s
the
hitch
don
t
you
see
granice
groaned
no
i
didn
t
you
mean
my
wanting
to
be
found
guilty
of
course
if
somebody
else
had
accused
you
the
story
might
have
been
worth
looking
into
as
it
is
a
child
could
have
invented
it
it
doesn
t
do
much
credit
to
your
granice
turned
sullenly
toward
the
door
what
was
the
use
of
arguing
but
on
the
threshold
a
sudden
impulse
drew
him
back
look
here
denver
i
daresay
you
re
right
but
will
you
do
just
one
thing
to
prove
it
put
my
statement
in
the
just
as
i
ve
made
it
ridicule
it
as
much
as
you
like
only
give
the
other
fellows
a
chance
at
it
men
who
don
t
know
anything
about
me
set
them
talking
and
looking
about
i
don
t
care
a
damn
whether
believe
me
what
i
want
is
to
convince
the
grand
jury
i
oughtn
t
to
have
come
to
a
man
who
knows
me
your
cursed
incredulity
is
infectious
i
don
t
put
my
case
well
because
i
know
in
advance
it
s
discredited
and
i
almost
end
by
not
believing
it
myself
that
s
why
i
can
t
convince
it
s
a
vicious
he
laid
a
hand
on
denver
s
arm
send
a
stenographer
and
put
my
statement
in
the
but
denver
did
not
warm
to
the
idea
my
dear
fellow
you
seem
to
forget
that
all
the
evidence
was
pretty
thoroughly
sifted
at
the
time
every
possible
clue
followed
up
the
public
would
have
been
ready
enough
then
to
believe
that
you
murdered
old
lenman
you
or
anybody
else
all
they
wanted
was
a
murderer
the
most
improbable
would
have
served
but
your
alibi
was
too
confoundedly
complete
and
nothing
you
ve
told
me
has
shaken
denver
laid
his
cool
hand
over
the
other
s
burning
fingers
look
here
old
fellow
go
home
and
work
up
a
better
case
then
come
in
and
submit
it
to
the
iv
the
perspiration
was
rolling
off
granice
s
forehead
every
few
minutes
he
had
to
draw
out
his
handkerchief
and
wipe
the
moisture
from
his
haggard
face
for
an
hour
and
a
half
he
had
been
talking
steadily
putting
his
case
to
the
district
attorney
luckily
he
had
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
allonby
and
had
obtained
without
much
difficulty
a
private
audience
on
the
very
day
after
his
talk
with
robert
denver
in
the
interval
between
he
had
hurried
home
got
out
of
his
evening
clothes
and
gone
forth
again
at
once
into
the
dreary
dawn
his
fear
of
ascham
and
the
alienist
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
remain
in
his
rooms
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
only
way
of
averting
that
hideous
peril
was
by
establishing
in
some
sane
impartial
mind
the
proof
of
his
guilt
even
if
he
had
not
been
so
incurably
sick
of
life
the
electric
chair
seemed
now
the
only
alternative
to
the
as
he
paused
to
wipe
his
forehead
he
saw
the
district
attorney
glance
at
his
watch
the
gesture
was
significant
and
granice
lifted
an
appealing
hand
i
don
t
expect
you
to
believe
me
now
but
can
t
you
put
me
under
arrest
and
have
the
thing
looked
into
allonby
smiled
faintly
under
his
heavy
grayish
moustache
he
had
a
ruddy
face
full
and
jovial
in
which
his
keen
professional
eyes
seemed
to
keep
watch
over
impulses
not
strictly
professional
well
i
don
t
know
that
we
need
lock
you
up
just
yet
but
of
course
i
m
bound
to
look
into
your
statement
granice
rose
with
an
exquisite
sense
of
relief
surely
allonby
wouldn
t
have
said
that
if
he
hadn
t
believed
him
that
s
all
right
then
i
needn
t
detain
you
i
can
be
found
at
any
time
at
my
he
gave
the
address
the
district
attorney
smiled
again
more
openly
what
do
you
say
to
leaving
it
for
an
hour
or
two
this
evening
i
m
giving
a
little
supper
at
rector
s
quiet
little
affair
you
understand
just
miss
melrose
i
think
you
know
her
and
a
friend
or
two
and
if
you
ll
join
us
granice
stumbled
out
of
the
office
without
knowing
what
reply
he
had
made
he
waited
for
four
days
four
days
of
concentrated
horror
during
the
first
hours
the
fear
of
ascham
s
alienist
dogged
him
and
as
that
subsided
it
was
replaced
by
the
exasperating
sense
that
his
avowal
had
made
no
impression
on
the
district
attorney
evidently
if
he
had
been
going
to
look
into
the
case
allonby
would
have
been
heard
from
before
now
and
that
mocking
invitation
to
supper
showed
clearly
enough
how
little
the
story
had
impressed
him
granice
was
overcome
by
the
futility
of
any
farther
attempt
to
inculpate
himself
he
was
chained
to
life
a
prisoner
of
where
was
it
he
had
read
the
phrase
well
he
was
learning
what
it
meant
in
the
glaring
when
his
brain
seemed
ablaze
he
was
visited
by
a
sense
of
his
fixed
identity
of
his
irreducible
inexpugnable
keener
more
insidious
more
unescapable
than
any
sensation
he
had
ever
known
he
had
not
guessed
that
the
mind
was
capable
of
such
intricacies
of
of
penetrating
so
deep
into
its
own
dark
windings
often
he
woke
from
his
brief
snatches
of
sleep
with
the
feeling
that
something
material
was
clinging
to
him
was
on
his
hands
and
face
and
in
his
throat
and
as
his
brain
cleared
he
understood
that
it
was
the
sense
of
his
own
loathed
personality
that
stuck
to
him
like
some
thick
viscous
substance
then
in
the
first
morning
hours
he
would
rise
and
look
out
of
his
window
at
the
awakening
activities
of
the
street
at
the
the
drivers
and
the
other
dingy
workers
flitting
hurriedly
by
through
the
sallow
winter
light
oh
to
be
one
of
them
any
of
them
to
take
his
chance
in
any
of
their
skins
they
were
the
toilers
the
men
whose
lot
was
pitied
the
victims
wept
over
and
ranted
about
by
altruists
and
economists
and
how
gladly
he
would
have
taken
up
the
load
of
any
one
of
them
if
only
he
might
have
shaken
off
his
own
but
no
the
iron
circle
of
consciousness
held
them
too
each
one
was
to
his
own
hideous
ego
why
wish
to
be
any
one
man
rather
than
another
the
only
absolute
good
was
not
to
be
and
flint
coming
in
to
draw
his
bath
would
ask
if
he
preferred
his
eggs
scrambled
or
poached
that
morning
on
the
fifth
day
he
wrote
a
long
urgent
letter
to
allonby
and
for
the
succeeding
two
days
he
had
the
occupation
of
waiting
for
an
answer
he
hardly
stirred
from
his
rooms
in
his
fear
of
missing
the
letter
by
a
moment
but
would
the
district
attorney
write
or
send
a
representative
a
policeman
a
secret
agent
or
some
other
mysterious
emissary
of
the
law
on
the
third
morning
flint
stepping
softly
as
if
confound
it
his
master
were
ill
entered
the
library
where
granice
sat
behind
an
unread
newspaper
and
proferred
a
card
on
a
tray
granice
read
the
name
j
hewson
and
underneath
in
pencil
from
the
district
attorney
s
he
started
up
with
a
thumping
heart
and
signed
an
assent
to
the
servant
hewson
was
a
slight
sallow
nondescript
man
of
about
fifty
the
kind
of
man
of
whom
one
is
sure
to
see
a
specimen
in
any
crowd
just
the
type
of
the
successful
detective
granice
reflected
as
he
shook
hands
with
his
visitor
and
it
was
in
that
character
that
hewson
briefly
introduced
himself
he
had
been
sent
by
the
district
attorney
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
granice
to
ask
him
to
repeat
the
statement
he
had
made
about
the
lenman
murder
his
manner
was
so
quiet
so
reasonable
and
receptive
that
granice
s
returned
here
was
a
sensible
man
a
man
who
knew
his
business
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
make
see
through
that
ridiculous
alibi
granice
offered
hewson
a
cigar
and
lighting
one
himself
to
prove
his
coolness
began
again
to
tell
his
story
he
was
conscious
as
he
proceeded
of
telling
it
better
than
ever
before
practice
helped
no
doubt
and
his
listener
s
detached
impartial
attitude
helped
still
more
he
could
see
that
hewson
at
least
had
not
decided
in
advance
to
disbelieve
him
and
the
sense
of
being
trusted
made
him
more
lucid
and
more
consecutive
yes
this
time
his
words
would
certainly
carry
conviction
v
despairingly
granice
gazed
up
and
down
the
shabby
street
beside
him
stood
a
young
man
with
bright
prominent
eyes
a
smooth
but
not
too
face
and
an
irish
smile
the
young
man
s
nimble
glance
followed
granice
s
sure
of
the
number
are
you
he
asked
briskly
oh
yes
it
was
well
then
the
new
building
has
swallowed
it
up
that
s
he
tilted
his
head
back
and
surveyed
the
front
of
a
brick
and
limestone
that
reared
its
flimsy
elegance
above
a
row
of
tottering
tenements
and
stables
dead
sure
he
repeated
yes
said
granice
discouraged
and
even
if
i
hadn
t
been
i
know
the
garage
was
just
opposite
leffler
s
over
he
pointed
across
the
street
to
a
stable
with
a
blotched
sign
on
which
the
words
livery
and
boarding
were
still
faintly
discernible
the
young
man
dashed
across
to
the
opposite
pavement
well
that
s
something
may
get
a
clue
there
leffler
s
same
name
there
anyhow
you
remember
that
name
yes
granice
had
felt
a
return
of
confidence
since
he
had
enlisted
the
interest
of
the
smartest
reporter
if
there
were
moments
when
he
hardly
believed
his
own
story
there
were
others
when
it
seemed
impossible
that
every
one
should
not
believe
it
and
young
peter
mccarren
peering
listening
questioning
jotting
down
notes
inspired
him
with
an
exquisite
sense
of
security
mccarren
had
fastened
on
the
case
at
once
like
a
leech
as
he
phrased
it
jumped
at
it
thrilled
to
it
and
settled
down
to
draw
the
last
drop
of
fact
from
it
and
had
not
let
go
till
he
no
one
else
had
treated
granice
in
that
way
even
allonby
s
detective
had
not
taken
a
single
note
and
though
a
week
had
elapsed
since
the
visit
of
that
authorized
official
nothing
had
been
heard
from
the
district
attorney
s
office
allonby
had
apparently
dropped
the
matter
again
but
mccarren
wasn
t
going
to
drop
it
not
he
he
positively
hung
on
granice
s
footsteps
they
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
previous
day
together
and
now
they
were
off
again
running
down
clues
but
at
leffler
s
they
got
none
after
all
leffler
s
was
no
longer
a
stable
it
was
condemned
to
demolition
and
in
the
respite
between
sentence
and
execution
it
had
become
a
vague
place
of
storage
a
hospital
for
carriages
and
carts
presided
over
by
a
old
woman
who
knew
nothing
of
flood
s
garage
across
the
way
did
not
even
remember
what
had
stood
there
before
the
new
began
to
rise
well
we
may
run
leffler
down
somewhere
i
ve
seen
harder
jobs
done
said
mccarren
cheerfully
noting
down
the
name
as
they
walked
back
toward
sixth
avenue
he
added
in
a
less
sanguine
tone
i
d
undertake
now
to
put
the
thing
through
if
you
could
only
put
me
on
the
track
of
that
granice
s
heart
sank
yes
there
was
the
weak
spot
he
had
felt
it
from
the
first
but
he
still
hoped
to
convince
mccarren
that
his
case
was
strong
enough
without
it
and
he
urged
the
reporter
to
come
back
to
his
rooms
and
sum
up
the
facts
with
him
again
sorry
granice
but
i
m
due
at
the
office
now
besides
it
d
be
no
use
till
i
get
some
fresh
stuff
to
work
on
suppose
i
call
you
up
tomorrow
or
next
day
he
plunged
into
a
trolley
and
left
granice
gazing
desolately
after
him
two
days
later
he
reappeared
at
the
apartment
a
shade
less
jaunty
in
demeanor
well
granice
the
stars
in
their
courses
are
against
you
as
the
bard
says
can
t
get
a
trace
of
flood
or
of
leffler
either
and
you
say
you
bought
the
motor
through
flood
and
sold
it
through
him
too
yes
said
granice
wearily
who
bought
it
do
you
know
granice
wrinkled
his
brows
why
flood
yes
flood
himself
i
sold
it
back
to
him
three
months
flood
the
devil
and
i
ve
ransacked
the
town
for
flood
that
kind
of
business
disappears
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
granice
discouraged
kept
silence
that
brings
us
back
to
the
poison
mccarren
continued
his
out
just
go
over
that
again
will
you
and
granice
went
over
it
again
it
had
all
been
so
simple
at
the
time
and
he
had
been
so
clever
in
covering
up
his
traces
as
soon
as
he
decided
on
poison
he
looked
about
for
an
acquaintance
who
manufactured
chemicals
and
there
was
jim
dawes
a
harvard
classmate
in
the
dyeing
business
just
the
man
but
at
the
last
moment
it
occurred
to
him
that
suspicion
might
turn
toward
so
obvious
an
opportunity
and
he
decided
on
a
more
tortuous
course
another
friend
carrick
venn
a
student
of
medicine
whom
irremediable
had
kept
from
the
practice
of
his
profession
amused
his
leisure
with
experiments
in
physics
for
the
exercise
of
which
he
had
set
up
a
simple
laboratory
granice
had
the
habit
of
dropping
in
to
smoke
a
cigar
with
him
on
sunday
afternoons
and
the
friends
generally
sat
in
venn
s
at
the
back
of
the
old
family
house
in
stuyvesant
square
off
this
was
the
cupboard
of
supplies
with
its
row
of
deadly
bottles
carrick
venn
was
an
original
a
man
of
restless
curious
tastes
and
his
place
on
a
sunday
was
often
full
of
visitors
a
cheerful
crowd
of
journalists
scribblers
painters
experimenters
in
divers
forms
of
expression
coming
and
going
among
so
many
it
was
easy
enough
to
pass
unperceived
and
one
afternoon
granice
arriving
before
venn
had
returned
home
found
himself
alone
in
the
and
quickly
slipping
into
the
cupboard
transferred
the
drug
to
his
pocket
but
that
had
happened
ten
years
ago
and
venn
poor
fellow
was
long
since
dead
of
his
dragging
ailment
his
old
father
was
dead
too
the
house
in
stuyvesant
square
had
been
turned
into
a
and
the
shifting
life
of
new
york
had
passed
its
rapid
sponge
over
every
trace
of
their
obscure
little
history
even
the
optimistic
mccarren
seemed
to
acknowledge
the
hopelessness
of
seeking
for
proof
in
that
direction
and
there
s
the
third
door
slammed
in
our
he
shut
his
and
throwing
back
his
head
rested
his
bright
inquisitive
eyes
on
granice
s
furrowed
face
look
here
granice
you
see
the
weak
spot
don
t
you
the
other
made
a
despairing
motion
i
see
so
many
yes
but
the
one
that
weakens
all
the
others
why
the
deuce
do
you
want
this
thing
known
why
do
you
want
to
put
your
head
into
the
noose
granice
looked
at
him
hopelessly
trying
to
take
the
measure
of
his
quick
light
irreverent
mind
no
one
so
full
of
a
cheerful
animal
life
would
believe
in
the
craving
for
death
as
a
sufficient
motive
and
granice
racked
his
brain
for
one
more
convincing
but
suddenly
he
saw
the
reporter
s
face
soften
and
melt
to
a
naive
sentimentalism
mr
granice
has
the
memory
of
it
always
haunted
you
granice
stared
a
moment
and
then
leapt
at
the
opening
that
s
it
the
memory
of
it
always
mccarren
nodded
vehemently
dogged
your
steps
eh
wouldn
t
let
you
sleep
the
time
came
when
you
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
had
to
can
t
you
understand
the
reporter
struck
his
fist
on
the
table
god
sir
i
don
t
suppose
there
s
a
human
being
with
a
drop
of
warm
blood
in
him
that
can
t
picture
the
deadly
horrors
of
remorse
the
celtic
imagination
was
aflame
and
granice
mutely
thanked
him
for
the
word
what
neither
ascham
nor
denver
would
accept
as
a
conceivable
motive
the
irish
reporter
seized
on
as
the
most
adequate
and
as
he
said
once
one
could
find
a
convincing
motive
the
difficulties
of
the
case
became
so
many
incentives
to
effort
remorse
he
repeated
rolling
the
word
under
his
tongue
with
an
accent
that
was
a
clue
to
the
psychology
of
the
popular
drama
and
granice
perversely
said
to
himself
if
i
could
only
have
struck
that
note
i
should
have
been
running
in
six
theatres
at
he
saw
that
from
that
moment
mccarren
s
professional
zeal
would
be
fanned
by
emotional
curiosity
and
he
profited
by
the
fact
to
propose
that
they
should
dine
together
and
go
on
afterward
to
some
or
theatre
it
was
becoming
necessary
to
granice
to
feel
himself
an
object
of
to
find
himself
in
another
mind
he
took
a
kind
of
gray
penumbral
pleasure
in
riveting
mccarren
s
attention
on
his
case
and
to
feign
the
grimaces
of
moral
anguish
became
a
passionately
engrossing
game
he
had
not
entered
a
theatre
for
months
but
he
sat
out
the
meaningless
performance
in
rigid
tolerance
sustained
by
the
sense
of
the
reporter
s
observation
between
the
acts
mccarren
amused
him
with
anecdotes
about
the
audience
he
knew
every
one
by
sight
and
could
lift
the
curtain
from
every
physiognomy
granice
listened
indulgently
he
had
lost
all
interest
in
his
kind
but
he
knew
that
he
was
himself
the
real
centre
of
mccarren
s
attention
and
that
every
word
the
latter
spoke
had
an
indirect
bearing
on
his
own
problem
see
that
fellow
over
there
the
little
man
in
the
third
row
pulling
his
moustache
memoirs
would
be
worth
publishing
mccarren
said
suddenly
in
the
last
granice
following
his
glance
recognized
the
detective
from
allonby
s
office
for
a
moment
he
had
the
thrilling
sense
that
he
was
being
shadowed
caesar
if
could
talk
mccarren
continued
know
who
he
is
of
course
john
stell
the
biggest
alienist
in
the
country
granice
with
a
start
bent
again
between
the
heads
in
front
of
him
man
the
fourth
from
the
aisle
you
re
mistaken
that
s
not
mccarren
laughed
well
i
guess
i
ve
been
in
court
enough
to
know
stell
when
i
see
him
he
testifies
in
nearly
all
the
big
cases
where
they
plead
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
granice
s
spine
but
he
repeated
obstinately
that
s
not
not
stell
why
man
i
him
look
here
he
comes
if
it
isn
t
stell
he
won
t
speak
to
the
little
man
was
moving
slowly
up
the
aisle
as
he
neared
mccarren
he
made
a
slight
gesture
of
recognition
how
do
doctor
stell
pretty
slim
show
ain
t
it
the
reporter
cheerfully
flung
out
at
him
and
j
hewson
with
a
nod
of
amicable
assent
passed
on
granice
sat
benumbed
he
knew
he
had
not
been
mistaken
the
man
who
had
just
passed
was
the
same
man
whom
allonby
had
sent
to
see
him
a
physician
disguised
as
a
detective
allonby
then
had
thought
him
insane
like
the
others
had
regarded
his
confession
as
the
maundering
of
a
maniac
the
discovery
froze
granice
with
horror
he
seemed
to
see
the
gaping
for
him
isn
t
there
a
man
a
good
deal
like
him
a
detective
named
j
hewson
but
he
knew
in
advance
what
mccarren
s
answer
would
be
hewson
j
hewson
never
heard
of
him
but
that
was
j
stell
fast
enough
i
guess
he
can
be
trusted
to
know
himself
and
you
saw
he
answered
to
his
vi
some
days
passed
before
granice
could
obtain
a
word
with
the
district
attorney
he
began
to
think
that
allonby
avoided
him
but
when
they
were
face
to
face
allonby
s
jovial
countenance
showed
no
sign
of
embarrassment
he
waved
his
visitor
to
a
chair
and
leaned
across
his
desk
with
the
encouraging
smile
of
a
consulting
physician
granice
broke
out
at
once
that
detective
you
sent
me
the
other
day
allonby
raised
a
deprecating
hand
i
know
it
was
stell
the
alienist
why
did
you
do
that
allonby
the
other
s
face
did
not
lose
its
composure
because
i
looked
up
your
story
first
and
there
s
nothing
in
nothing
in
it
granice
furiously
interposed
absolutely
nothing
if
there
is
why
the
deuce
don
t
you
bring
me
proofs
i
know
you
ve
been
talking
to
peter
ascham
and
to
denver
and
to
that
little
ferret
mccarren
of
the
have
any
of
them
been
able
to
make
out
a
case
for
you
no
well
what
am
i
to
do
granice
s
lips
began
to
tremble
why
did
you
play
me
that
trick
about
stell
i
had
to
my
dear
fellow
it
s
part
of
my
business
stell
a
detective
if
you
come
to
that
every
doctor
the
trembling
of
granice
s
lips
increased
communicating
itself
in
a
long
quiver
to
his
facial
muscles
he
forced
a
laugh
through
his
dry
throat
well
and
what
did
he
detect
in
you
oh
he
thinks
it
s
overwork
overwork
and
too
much
smoking
if
you
look
in
on
him
some
day
at
his
office
he
ll
show
you
the
record
of
hundreds
of
cases
like
yours
and
advise
you
what
treatment
to
follow
it
s
one
of
the
commonest
forms
of
hallucination
have
a
cigar
all
the
but
allonby
i
killed
that
man
the
district
attorney
s
large
hand
outstretched
on
his
desk
had
an
almost
imperceptible
gesture
and
a
moment
later
as
if
an
answer
to
the
call
of
an
electric
bell
a
clerk
looked
in
from
the
outer
office
sorry
my
dear
fellow
lot
of
people
waiting
drop
in
on
stell
some
morning
allonby
said
shaking
hands
mccarren
had
to
own
himself
beaten
there
was
absolutely
no
flaw
in
the
alibi
and
since
his
duty
to
his
journal
obviously
forbade
his
wasting
time
on
insoluble
mysteries
he
ceased
to
frequent
granice
who
dropped
back
into
a
deeper
isolation
for
a
day
or
two
after
his
visit
to
allonby
he
continued
to
live
in
dread
of
stell
why
might
not
allonby
have
deceived
him
as
to
the
alienist
s
diagnosis
what
if
he
were
really
being
shadowed
not
by
a
police
agent
but
by
a
to
have
the
truth
out
he
suddenly
determined
to
call
on
stell
the
physician
received
him
kindly
and
reverted
without
embarrassment
to
the
conditions
of
their
previous
meeting
we
have
to
do
that
occasionally
granice
it
s
one
of
our
methods
and
you
had
given
allonby
a
granice
was
silent
he
would
have
liked
to
reaffirm
his
guilt
to
produce
the
fresh
arguments
which
had
occurred
to
him
since
his
last
talk
with
the
physician
but
he
feared
his
eagerness
might
be
taken
for
a
symptom
of
derangement
and
he
affected
to
smile
away
stell
s
allusion
you
think
then
it
s
a
case
of
nothing
more
nothing
more
and
i
should
advise
you
to
knock
off
tobacco
you
smoke
a
good
deal
don
t
you
he
developed
his
treatment
recommending
massage
gymnastics
travel
or
any
form
of
diversion
that
did
not
that
in
short
granice
interrupted
him
impatiently
oh
i
loathe
all
that
and
i
m
sick
of
h
m
then
some
larger
interest
politics
reform
philanthropy
something
to
take
you
out
of
yes
i
understand
said
granice
wearily
above
all
don
t
lose
heart
i
see
hundreds
of
cases
like
yours
the
doctor
added
cheerfully
from
the
threshold
on
the
doorstep
granice
stood
still
and
laughed
hundreds
of
cases
like
his
the
case
of
a
man
who
had
committed
a
murder
who
confessed
his
guilt
and
whom
no
one
would
believe
why
there
had
never
been
a
case
like
it
in
the
world
what
a
good
figure
stell
would
have
made
in
a
play
the
great
alienist
who
couldn
t
read
a
man
s
mind
any
better
than
that
granice
saw
huge
comic
opportunities
in
the
type
but
as
he
walked
away
his
fears
dispelled
the
sense
of
listlessness
returned
on
him
for
the
first
time
since
his
avowal
to
peter
ascham
he
found
himself
without
an
occupation
and
understood
that
he
had
been
carried
through
the
past
weeks
only
by
the
necessity
of
constant
action
now
his
life
had
once
more
become
a
stagnant
backwater
and
as
he
stood
on
the
street
corner
watching
the
tides
of
traffic
sweep
by
he
asked
himself
despairingly
how
much
longer
he
could
endure
to
float
about
in
the
sluggish
circle
of
his
consciousness
the
thought
of
recurred
to
him
but
again
his
flesh
recoiled
he
yearned
for
death
from
other
hands
but
he
could
never
take
it
from
his
own
and
aside
from
his
insuperable
physical
reluctance
another
motive
restrained
him
he
was
possessed
by
the
dogged
desire
to
establish
the
truth
of
his
story
he
refused
to
be
swept
aside
as
an
irresponsible
dreamer
even
if
he
had
to
kill
himself
in
the
end
he
would
not
do
so
before
proving
to
society
that
he
had
deserved
death
from
it
he
began
to
write
long
letters
to
the
papers
but
after
the
first
had
been
published
and
commented
on
public
curiosity
was
quelled
by
a
brief
statement
from
the
district
attorney
s
office
and
the
rest
of
his
communications
remained
unprinted
ascham
came
to
see
him
and
begged
him
to
travel
robert
denver
dropped
in
and
tried
to
joke
him
out
of
his
delusion
till
granice
mistrustful
of
their
motives
began
to
dread
the
reappearance
of
stell
and
set
a
guard
on
his
lips
but
the
words
he
kept
back
engendered
others
and
still
others
in
his
brain
his
inner
self
became
a
humming
factory
of
arguments
and
he
spent
long
hours
reciting
and
writing
down
elaborate
statements
of
his
crime
which
he
constantly
retouched
and
developed
then
gradually
his
activity
languished
under
the
lack
of
an
audience
the
sense
of
being
buried
beneath
deepening
drifts
of
indifference
in
a
passion
of
resentment
he
swore
that
he
would
prove
himself
a
murderer
even
if
he
had
to
commit
another
crime
to
do
it
and
for
a
sleepless
night
or
two
the
thought
flamed
red
on
his
darkness
but
daylight
dispelled
it
the
determining
impulse
was
lacking
and
he
hated
too
promiscuously
to
choose
his
victim
so
he
was
thrown
back
on
the
unavailing
struggle
to
impose
the
truth
of
his
story
as
fast
as
one
channel
closed
on
him
he
tried
to
pierce
another
through
the
sliding
sands
of
incredulity
but
every
issue
seemed
blocked
and
the
whole
human
race
leagued
together
to
cheat
one
man
of
the
right
to
die
thus
viewed
the
situation
became
so
monstrous
that
he
lost
his
last
shred
of
in
contemplating
it
what
if
he
were
really
the
victim
of
some
mocking
experiment
the
centre
of
a
ring
of
jeering
at
a
poor
creature
in
its
blind
dashes
against
the
solid
walls
of
consciousness
but
no
men
were
not
so
uniformly
cruel
there
were
flaws
in
the
close
surface
of
their
indifference
cracks
of
weakness
and
pity
here
and
there
granice
began
to
think
that
his
mistake
lay
in
having
appealed
to
persons
more
or
less
familiar
with
his
past
and
to
whom
the
visible
conformities
of
his
life
seemed
a
final
disproof
of
its
one
fierce
secret
deviation
the
general
tendency
was
to
take
for
the
whole
of
life
the
slit
seen
between
the
blinders
of
habit
and
in
his
walk
down
that
narrow
vista
granice
cut
a
correct
enough
figure
to
a
vision
free
to
follow
his
whole
orbit
his
story
would
be
more
intelligible
it
would
be
easier
to
convince
a
chance
idler
in
the
street
than
the
trained
intelligence
hampered
by
a
sense
of
his
antecedents
this
idea
shot
up
in
him
with
the
tropic
luxuriance
of
each
new
seed
of
thought
and
he
began
to
walk
the
streets
and
to
frequent
and
bars
in
his
search
for
the
impartial
stranger
to
whom
he
should
disclose
himself
at
first
every
face
looked
encouragement
but
at
the
crucial
moment
he
always
held
back
so
much
was
at
stake
and
it
was
so
essential
that
his
first
choice
should
be
decisive
he
dreaded
stupidity
timidity
intolerance
the
imaginative
eye
the
furrowed
brow
were
what
he
sought
he
must
reveal
himself
only
to
a
heart
versed
in
the
tortuous
motions
of
the
human
will
and
he
began
to
hate
the
dull
benevolence
of
the
average
face
once
or
twice
obscurely
allusively
he
made
a
beginning
once
sitting
down
at
a
man
s
side
in
a
basement
another
day
approaching
a
lounger
on
an
wharf
but
in
both
cases
the
premonition
of
failure
checked
him
on
the
brink
of
avowal
his
dread
of
being
taken
for
a
man
in
the
clutch
of
a
fixed
idea
gave
him
an
unnatural
keenness
in
reading
the
expression
of
his
interlocutors
and
he
had
provided
himself
in
advance
with
a
series
of
verbal
alternatives
of
evasion
from
the
first
dart
of
ridicule
or
suspicion
he
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
the
streets
coming
home
at
irregular
hours
dreading
the
silence
and
orderliness
of
his
apartment
and
the
critical
scrutiny
of
flint
his
real
life
was
spent
in
a
world
so
remote
from
this
familiar
setting
that
he
sometimes
had
the
mysterious
sense
of
a
living
metempsychosis
a
furtive
passage
from
one
identity
to
another
yet
the
other
as
unescapably
himself
one
humiliation
he
was
spared
the
desire
to
live
never
revived
in
him
not
for
a
moment
was
he
tempted
to
a
shabby
pact
with
existing
conditions
he
wanted
to
die
wanted
it
with
the
fixed
unwavering
desire
which
alone
attains
its
end
and
still
the
end
eluded
him
it
would
not
always
of
course
he
had
full
faith
in
the
dark
star
of
his
destiny
and
he
could
prove
it
best
by
repeating
his
story
persistently
and
indefatigably
pouring
it
into
indifferent
ears
hammering
it
into
dull
brains
till
at
last
it
kindled
a
spark
and
some
one
of
the
careless
millions
paused
listened
believed
it
was
a
mild
march
day
and
he
had
been
loitering
on
the
docks
looking
at
faces
he
was
becoming
an
expert
in
physiognomies
his
eagerness
no
longer
made
rash
darts
and
awkward
recoils
he
knew
now
the
face
he
needed
as
clearly
as
if
it
had
come
to
him
in
a
vision
and
not
till
he
found
it
would
he
speak
as
he
walked
eastward
through
the
shabby
reeking
streets
he
had
a
premonition
that
he
should
find
it
that
morning
perhaps
it
was
the
promise
of
spring
in
the
air
certainly
he
felt
calmer
than
for
many
days
he
turned
into
washington
square
struck
across
it
obliquely
and
walked
up
university
place
its
heterogeneous
passers
always
allured
him
they
were
less
hurried
than
in
broadway
less
enclosed
and
classified
than
in
fifth
avenue
he
walked
slowly
watching
for
his
face
at
union
square
he
felt
a
sudden
relapse
into
discouragement
like
a
votary
who
has
watched
too
long
for
a
sign
from
the
altar
perhaps
after
all
he
should
never
find
his
face
the
air
was
languid
and
he
felt
tired
he
walked
between
the
bald
and
the
twisted
trees
making
for
an
empty
seat
presently
he
passed
a
bench
on
which
a
girl
sat
alone
and
something
as
definite
as
the
twitch
of
a
cord
made
him
stop
before
her
he
had
never
dreamed
of
telling
his
story
to
a
girl
had
hardly
looked
at
the
women
s
faces
as
they
passed
his
case
was
man
s
work
how
could
a
woman
help
him
but
this
girl
s
face
was
extraordinary
quiet
and
wide
as
a
clear
evening
sky
it
suggested
a
hundred
images
of
space
distance
mystery
like
ships
he
had
seen
as
a
boy
quietly
berthed
by
a
familiar
wharf
but
with
the
breath
of
far
seas
and
strange
harbours
in
their
shrouds
certainly
this
girl
would
understand
he
went
up
to
her
quietly
lifting
his
hat
observing
the
forms
wishing
her
to
see
at
once
that
he
was
a
i
am
a
stranger
to
you
he
began
sitting
down
beside
her
but
your
face
is
so
extremely
intelligent
that
i
feel
i
feel
it
is
the
face
i
ve
waited
for
looked
for
everywhere
and
i
want
to
tell
you
the
girl
s
eyes
widened
she
rose
to
her
feet
she
was
escaping
him
in
his
dismay
he
ran
a
few
steps
after
her
and
caught
her
roughly
by
the
arm
here
wait
listen
oh
don
t
scream
you
fool
he
shouted
out
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
own
arm
turned
and
confronted
a
policeman
instantly
he
understood
that
he
was
being
arrested
and
something
hard
within
him
was
loosened
and
ran
to
tears
ah
you
know
you
i
m
guilty
he
was
conscious
that
a
crowd
was
forming
and
that
the
girl
s
frightened
face
had
disappeared
but
what
did
he
care
about
her
face
it
was
the
policeman
who
had
really
understood
him
he
turned
and
followed
the
crowd
at
his
heels
vii
in
the
charming
place
in
which
he
found
himself
there
were
so
many
sympathetic
faces
that
he
felt
more
than
ever
convinced
of
the
certainty
of
making
himself
heard
it
was
a
bad
blow
at
first
to
find
that
he
had
not
been
arrested
for
murder
but
ascham
who
had
come
to
him
at
once
explained
that
he
needed
rest
and
the
time
to
review
his
statements
it
appeared
that
reiteration
had
made
them
a
little
confused
and
contradictory
to
this
end
he
had
willingly
acquiesced
in
his
removal
to
a
large
quiet
establishment
with
an
open
space
and
trees
about
it
where
he
had
found
a
number
of
intelligent
companions
some
like
himself
engaged
in
preparing
or
reviewing
statements
of
their
cases
and
others
ready
to
lend
an
interested
ear
to
his
own
recital
for
a
time
he
was
content
to
let
himself
go
on
the
tranquil
current
of
this
existence
but
although
his
auditors
gave
him
for
the
most
part
an
encouraging
attention
which
in
some
went
the
length
of
really
brilliant
and
helpful
suggestion
he
gradually
felt
a
recurrence
of
his
old
doubts
either
his
hearers
were
not
sincere
or
else
they
had
less
power
to
aid
him
than
they
boasted
his
interminable
conferences
resulted
in
nothing
and
as
the
benefit
of
the
long
rest
made
itself
felt
it
produced
an
increased
mental
lucidity
which
rendered
inaction
more
and
more
unbearable
at
length
he
discovered
that
on
certain
days
visitors
from
the
outer
world
were
admitted
to
his
retreat
and
he
wrote
out
long
and
logically
constructed
relations
of
his
crime
and
furtively
slipped
them
into
the
hands
of
these
messengers
of
hope
this
occupation
gave
him
a
fresh
lease
of
patience
and
he
now
lived
only
to
watch
for
the
visitors
days
and
scan
the
faces
that
swept
by
him
like
stars
seen
and
lost
in
the
rifts
of
a
hurrying
sky
mostly
these
faces
were
strange
and
less
intelligent
than
those
of
his
companions
but
they
represented
his
last
means
of
access
to
the
world
a
kind
of
subterranean
channel
on
which
he
could
set
his
statements
afloat
like
paper
boats
which
the
mysterious
current
might
sweep
out
into
the
open
seas
of
life
one
day
however
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
familiar
contour
a
pair
of
bright
prominent
eyes
and
a
chin
insufficiently
shaved
he
sprang
up
and
stood
in
the
path
of
peter
mccarren
the
journalist
looked
at
him
doubtfully
then
held
out
his
hand
with
a
startled
deprecating
you
didn
t
know
me
i
m
so
changed
granice
faltered
feeling
the
rebound
of
the
other
s
wonder
why
no
but
you
re
looking
quieter
smoothed
out
mccarren
smiled
yes
that
s
what
i
m
here
for
to
rest
and
i
ve
taken
the
opportunity
to
write
out
a
clearer
statement
granice
s
hand
shook
so
that
he
could
hardly
draw
the
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
that
the
reporter
was
accompanied
by
a
tall
man
with
grave
compassionate
eyes
it
came
to
granice
in
a
wild
thrill
of
conviction
that
this
was
the
face
he
had
waited
for
perhaps
your
friend
he
your
friend
would
glance
over
it
or
i
could
put
the
case
in
a
few
words
if
you
have
time
granice
s
voice
shook
like
his
hand
if
this
chance
escaped
him
he
felt
that
his
last
hope
was
gone
mccarren
and
the
stranger
looked
at
each
other
and
the
former
glanced
at
his
watch
i
m
sorry
we
can
t
stay
and
talk
it
over
now
granice
but
my
friend
has
an
engagement
and
we
re
rather
pressed
granice
continued
to
proffer
the
paper
i
m
sorry
i
think
i
could
have
explained
but
you
ll
take
this
at
any
rate
the
stranger
looked
at
him
gently
certainly
i
ll
take
he
had
his
hand
out
granice
echoed
he
stood
watching
the
two
men
move
away
from
him
through
the
long
light
hall
and
as
he
watched
them
a
tear
ran
down
his
face
but
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
he
turned
and
walked
hastily
toward
his
room
beginning
to
hope
again
already
planning
a
new
statement
outside
the
building
the
two
men
stood
still
and
the
journalist
s
companion
looked
up
curiously
at
the
long
monotonous
rows
of
barred
windows
so
that
was
granice
yes
that
was
granice
poor
devil
said
mccarren
strange
case
i
suppose
there
s
never
been
one
just
like
it
he
s
still
absolutely
convinced
that
he
committed
that
murder
absolutely
the
stranger
reflected
and
there
was
no
conceivable
ground
for
the
idea
no
one
could
make
out
how
it
started
a
quiet
conventional
sort
of
fellow
like
that
where
do
you
suppose
he
got
such
a
delusion
did
you
ever
get
the
least
clue
to
it
mccarren
stood
still
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
head
cocked
up
in
contemplation
of
the
barred
windows
then
he
turned
his
bright
hard
gaze
on
his
companion
that
was
the
queer
part
of
it
i
ve
never
spoken
of
it
but
i
get
a
by
jove
that
s
interesting
what
was
it
mccarren
formed
his
red
lips
into
a
whistle
why
that
it
wasn
t
a
he
produced
his
effect
the
other
turned
on
him
with
a
pallid
stare
he
murdered
the
man
all
right
i
tumbled
on
the
truth
by
the
merest
accident
when
i
d
pretty
nearly
chucked
the
whole
he
murdered
him
murdered
his
cousin
sure
as
you
live
only
don
t
split
on
me
it
s
about
the
queerest
business
i
ever
ran
into
about
it
why
what
was
i
to
do
i
couldn
t
hang
the
poor
devil
could
i
lord
but
i
was
glad
when
they
collared
him
and
had
him
stowed
away
safe
in
there
the
tall
man
listened
with
a
grave
face
grasping
granice
s
statement
in
his
hand
here
take
this
it
makes
me
sick
he
said
abruptly
thrusting
the
paper
at
the
reporter
and
the
two
men
turned
and
walked
in
silence
to
the
gates
his
father
s
son
i
after
his
wife
s
death
mason
grew
took
the
momentous
step
of
selling
out
his
business
and
moving
from
wingfield
connecticut
to
brooklyn
for
years
he
had
secretly
nursed
the
hope
of
such
a
change
but
had
never
dared
to
suggest
it
to
mrs
grew
a
woman
of
immutable
habits
mr
grew
himself
was
attached
to
wingfield
where
he
had
grown
up
prospered
and
become
what
the
local
press
described
as
he
was
attached
to
his
ugly
brick
house
with
sandstone
trimmings
and
a
neatly
sanded
to
match
to
the
similar
row
of
houses
across
the
street
the
trolley
wires
forming
a
kind
of
aerial
pathway
between
and
the
sprawling
vista
closed
by
the
steeple
of
the
church
which
he
and
his
wife
had
always
attended
and
where
their
only
child
had
been
baptized
it
was
hard
to
snap
all
these
threads
of
association
visual
and
sentimental
yet
still
harder
now
that
he
was
alone
to
live
so
far
from
his
boy
ronald
grew
was
practising
law
in
new
york
and
there
was
no
more
chance
of
returning
to
live
at
wingfield
than
of
a
river
s
flowing
inland
from
the
sea
therefore
to
be
near
him
his
father
must
move
and
it
was
characteristic
of
mr
grew
and
of
the
situation
generally
that
the
translation
when
it
took
place
was
to
brooklyn
and
not
to
new
york
why
you
bury
yourself
in
that
hole
i
can
t
think
had
been
ronald
s
comment
and
mr
grew
simply
replied
that
rents
were
lower
in
brooklyn
and
that
he
had
heard
of
a
house
that
would
suit
him
in
reality
he
had
said
to
himself
being
the
only
recipient
of
his
own
confidences
that
if
he
went
to
new
york
he
might
be
on
the
boy
s
mind
whereas
if
he
lived
in
brooklyn
ronald
would
always
have
a
good
excuse
for
not
popping
over
to
see
him
every
other
day
the
sociological
isolation
of
brooklyn
combined
with
its
geographical
nearness
presented
in
fact
the
precise
conditions
for
grew
s
case
he
wanted
to
be
near
enough
to
new
york
to
go
there
often
to
feel
under
his
feet
the
same
pavement
that
ronald
trod
to
sit
now
and
then
in
the
same
theatres
and
find
on
his
the
journals
which
with
increasing
frequency
inserted
ronald
s
name
in
the
sacred
bounds
of
the
society
column
it
had
always
been
a
trial
to
mr
grew
to
have
to
wait
hours
to
read
that
among
those
present
was
ronald
now
he
had
it
with
his
coffee
and
left
it
on
the
to
the
perusal
of
a
hired
girl
cosmopolitan
enough
to
do
it
justice
in
such
ways
brooklyn
attested
the
advantages
of
its
propinquity
to
new
york
while
remaining
as
regards
ronald
s
duty
to
his
father
as
remote
and
inaccessible
as
wingfield
it
was
not
that
ronald
shirked
his
filial
obligations
but
rather
because
of
his
heavy
sense
of
them
that
mr
grew
so
persistently
sought
to
minimize
and
lighten
them
it
was
he
who
insisted
to
ronald
on
the
immense
difficulty
of
getting
from
new
york
to
brooklyn

ragged

attention

weeks

next
sunday
or
i
ll
set
the
dogs
on

and
you
wouldn
t
find
me
in
anyhow
come
to
think
of
it
i
m
lunching
out
myself
as
it
happens
yes
sir
is
there
anything
especially
comic
in
my
lunching
out
i
don
t
often
do
it
you
say
well
that
s
no
reason
why
i
never
should
who
with
why
with
with
old
bleaker
eliphalet
bleaker
no
you
wouldn
t
know
about
him
he
s
only
an
old
friend
of
your
mother
s
and
gradually
ronald
s
insistence
became
less
difficult
to
overcome
with
his
customary
sweetness
and
tact
as
mr
grew
put
it
he
began
to
take
the
hint
to
give
in
to
the
old
gentleman
s
growing
desire
for
solitude
i
m
set
in
my
ways
ronny
that
s
about
the
size
of
it
i
like
to
go
along
like
a
clock
i
always
did
and
when
you
come
bouncing
in
i
never
feel
sure
there
s
enough
for
dinner
or
that
i
haven
t
sent
maria
out
for
the
evening
and
i
don
t
want
the
neighbors
to
see
me
opening
my
own
door
to
my
son
that
s
the
kind
of
cringing
snob
i
am
don
t
give
me
away
will
you
i
want
em
to
think
i
keep
four
or
five
powdered
flunkeys
in
the
hall
day
and
night
same
as
the
lobby
of
one
of
those
fifth
avenue
hotels
and
if
you
pop
over
when
you
re
not
expected
how
am
i
going
to
keep
up
the
bluff
ronald
yielded
after
the
proper
amount
of
resistance
his
intuitive
sense
in
every
social
transaction
of
the
proper
amount
of
force
to
be
expended
was
one
of
the
qualities
his
father
most
admired
in
him
grew
s
perceptions
in
this
line
were
probably
more
acute
than
his
son
suspected
the
souls
of
short
men
with
chubby
features
whiskers
and
pale
eyes
peering
between
folds
of
fat
like
almond
kernels
in
shells
souls
thus
encased
do
not
reveal
themselves
to
the
casual
scrutiny
as
delicate
emotional
instruments
but
in
spite
of
the
dense
disguise
in
which
he
walked
mr
grew
vibrated
exquisitely
in
response
to
every
imaginative
appeal
and
his
son
ronald
was
perpetually
stimulating
and
feeding
his
imagination
ronald
in
fact
constituted
his
father
s
one
escape
from
the
impenetrable
element
of
mediocrity
which
had
always
hemmed
him
in
to
a
man
so
enamoured
of
beauty
and
so
little
qualified
to
add
to
its
sum
total
it
was
a
wonderful
privilege
to
have
bestowed
on
the
world
such
a
being
ronald
s
resemblance
to
grew
s
early
conception
of
what
he
himself
would
have
liked
to
look
might
have
put
new
life
into
the
discredited
theory
of
influences
at
any
rate
if
the
young
man
owed
his
beauty
his
distinction
and
his
winning
manner
to
the
dreams
of
one
of
his
parents
it
was
certainly
to
those
of
mr
grew
who
while
outwardly
devoting
his
life
to
the
manufacture
and
dissemination
of
grew
s
secure
suspender
buckle
moved
in
an
enchanted
inward
world
peopled
with
all
the
figures
of
romance
in
this
high
company
mr
grew
cut
as
brilliant
a
figure
as
any
of
its
noble
phantoms
and
to
see
his
vision
of
himself
suddenly
projected
on
the
outer
world
in
the
shape
of
a
brilliant
popular
conquering
son
seemed
in
retrospect
to
give
to
that
image
a
belated
objective
reality
there
were
even
moments
when
forgetting
his
physiognomy
mr
grew
said
to
himself
that
if
he
d
had
half
a
chance
he
might
have
done
as
well
as
ronald
but
this
only
fortified
his
resolve
that
ronald
should
do
infinitely
better
ronald
s
ability
to
do
well
almost
equalled
his
gift
of
looking
well
mr
grew
constantly
affirmed
to
himself
that
the
boy
was
not
a
genius
but
barring
this
slight
deficiency
he
was
almost
everything
that
a
parent
could
wish
even
at
harvard
he
had
managed
to
be
several
desirable
things
at
once
writing
poetry
in
the
college
magazine
playing
delightfully
by
ear
acquitting
himself
honorably
in
his
studies
and
yet
holding
his
own
in
the
fashionable
sporting
set
that
formed
as
it
were
the
gateway
of
the
temple
of
society
grew
s
idealism
did
not
preclude
the
frank
desire
that
his
son
should
pass
through
that
gateway
but
the
wish
was
not
prompted
by
material
considerations
it
was
grew
s
notion
that
in
the
rough
and
hurrying
current
of
a
new
civilization
the
little
pools
of
leisure
and
enjoyment
must
nurture
delicate
growths
material
graces
as
well
as
moral
refinements
likely
to
be
uprooted
and
swept
away
by
the
rush
of
the
main
torrent
he
based
his
theory
on
the
fact
that
he
had
liked
the
few
society
people
he
had
met
had
found
their
manners
simpler
their
voices
more
agreeable
their
views
more
consonant
with
his
own
than
those
of
the
leading
citizens
of
wingfield
but
then
he
had
met
very
few
ronald
s
sympathies
needed
no
urging
in
the
same
direction
he
took
naturally
dauntlessly
to
all
the
high
and
exceptional
things
about
which
his
father
s
imagination
had
so
long
sheepishly
and
ineffectually
hovered
from
the
start
he
what
mr
grew
had
dreamed
of
being
and
so
precise
so
detailed
was
grew
s
vision
of
his
own
imaginary
career
that
as
ronald
grew
up
and
began
to
travel
in
a
widening
orbit
his
father
had
an
almost
uncanny
sense
of
the
extent
to
which
that
career
was
enacting
itself
before
him
at
harvard
ronald
had
done
exactly
what
the
hypothetical
mason
grew
would
have
done
had
not
his
actual
self
at
the
same
age
been
working
his
way
up
in
old
slagden
s
button
factory
the
institution
which
was
later
to
acquire
fame
and
even
notoriety
as
the
birthplace
of
grew
s
secure
suspender
buckle
afterward
at
a
period
when
the
actual
grew
had
passed
from
the
factory
to
the
bookkeeper
s
desk
his
invisible
double
had
been
reading
law
at
columbia
precisely
again
what
ronald
did
but
it
was
when
the
young
man
left
the
paths
laid
out
for
him
by
the
parental
hand
and
cast
himself
boldly
on
the
world
that
his
adventures
began
to
bear
the
most
astonishing
resemblance
to
those
of
the
unrealized
mason
grew
it
was
in
new
york
that
the
scene
of
this
hypothetical
being
s
first
exploits
had
always
been
laid
and
it
was
in
new
york
that
ronald
was
to
achieve
his
first
triumph
there
was
nothing
small
or
timid
about
grew
s
imagination
it
had
never
stopped
at
anything
between
wingfield
and
the
metropolis
and
the
real
ronald
had
the
same
cosmic
vision
as
his
parent
he
brushed
aside
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
his
mother
s
tearful
entreaty
that
he
should
stay
at
wingfield
and
continue
the
dynasty
of
the
grew
suspender
buckle
mr
grew
knew
that
in
reality
ronald
winced
at
the
buckle
loathed
it
blushed
for
his
connection
with
it
yet
it
was
the
buckle
that
had
seen
him
through
groton
harvard
and
the
law
school
and
had
permitted
him
to
enter
the
office
of
a
distinguished
corporation
lawyer
instead
of
being
enslaved
to
some
sordid
business
with
quick
returns
the
buckle
had
been
ronald
s
fairy
godmother
yet
his
father
did
not
blame
him
for
abhorring
and
disowning
it
mr
grew
himself
often
bitterly
regretted
having
bestowed
his
own
name
on
the
instrument
of
his
material
success
though
at
the
time
his
doing
so
had
been
the
natural
expression
of
his
romanticism
when
he
invented
the
buckle
and
took
out
his
patent
he
and
his
wife
both
felt
that
to
bestow
their
name
on
it
was
like
naming
a
or
a
peak
of
the
andes
mrs
grew
had
never
learned
to
know
better
but
mr
grew
had
discovered
his
error
before
ronald
was
out
of
school
he
read
it
first
in
a
black
eye
of
his
boy
s
ronald
s
symmetry
had
been
marred
by
the
insolent
fist
of
a
fourth
former
whom
he
had
chastised
for
alluding
to
his
father
as
old
buckles
and
when
mr
grew
heard
the
epithet
he
understood
in
a
flash
that
the
buckle
was
a
thing
to
blush
for
it
was
too
late
then
to
dissociate
his
name
from
it
or
to
efface
from
the
hoardings
of
the
entire
continent
the
picture
of
two
gentlemen
one
contorting
himself
in
the
abject
effort
to
repair
a
broken
brace
while
the
careless
ease
of
the
other
s
attitude
proclaimed
his
trust
in
the
secure
suspender
buckle
these
records
were
indelible
but
ronald
could
at
least
be
spared
all
direct
connection
with
them
and
from
that
day
mr
grew
resolved
that
the
boy
should
not
return
to
wingfield
you
ll
see
he
had
said
to
mrs
grew
he
ll
take
right
hold
in
new
york
ronald
s
got
my
knack
for
taking
hold
he
added
throwing
out
his
chest
but
the
way
you
took
hold
was
in
business
objected
mrs
grew
who
was
large
and
literal
grew
s
chest
collapsed
and
he
became
suddenly
conscious
of
his
comic
face
in
its
rim
of
sandy
whiskers
that
s
not
the
only
way
he
said
with
a
touch
of
wistfulness
which
escaped
his
wife
s
analysis
well
of
course
you
could
have
written
beautifully
she
rejoined
with
admiring
eyes
written
me
mr
grew
became
sardonic
why
those
letters
weren
t
beautiful
i
d
like
to
know
the
couple
exchanged
a
glance
innocently
allusive
and
amused
on
the
wife
s
part
and
charged
with
a
sudden
tragic
significance
on
the
husband
s
well
i
ve
got
to
be
going
along
to
the
office
now
he
merely
said
dragging
himself
out
of
his
this
had
happened
while
ronald
was
still
at
school
and
now
mrs
grew
slept
in
the
wingfield
cemetery
under
a
theological
virtue
of
her
own
choosing
and
grew
s
prognostications
as
to
ronald
s
ability
to
take
right
hold
in
new
york
were
being
more
and
more
brilliantly
fulfilled
ii
ronald
obeyed
his
father
s
injunction
not
to
come
to
luncheon
on
the
day
of
the
bankshires
dinner
but
in
the
middle
of
the
following
week
mr
grew
was
surprised
by
a
telegram
from
his
son
want
to
see
you
important
matter
expect
me
mr
grew
received
the
telegram
after
breakfast
to
peruse
it
he
had
lifted
his
eye
from
a
paragraph
of
the
morning
paper
describing
a
dinner
which
had
taken
place
the
night
before
at
the
hamilton
gliddens
for
the
of
their
new
fifth
avenue
palace
among
the
couples
who
afterward
danced
in
the
poets
quadrille
were
miss
daisy
bankshire
looking
more
than
usually
lovely
as
laura
and
ronald
grew
as
the
young
petrarch
and
laura
well
if
meant
anything
mr
grew
supposed
he
knew
what
that
meant
for
weeks
past
he
had
noticed
how
constantly
the
names
of
the
young
people
appeared
together
in
the
society
notes
he
so
insatiably
devoured
even
the
soulless
reporter
was
getting
into
the
habit
of
coupling
them
in
his
lists
and
this
laura
and
petrarch
business
was
almost
an
announcement
mr
grew
dropped
the
telegram
wiped
his
and
the
paragraph
miss
daisy
bankshire
more
than
usually
lovely
yes
she
lovely
he
had
often
seen
her
photograph
in
the
papers
seen
her
represented
in
every
conceivable
attitude
of
the
mundane
game
fondling
her
prize
taking
a
fence
on
her
thoroughbred
dancing
a
all
patches
and
plumes
or
fingering
a
guitar
all
tulle
and
lilies
and
once
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
at
the
theatre
hearing
that
ronald
was
going
to
a
fashionable
with
the
bankshires
mr
grew
had
for
once
overcome
his
repugnance
to
following
his
son
s
movements
and
had
secured
for
himself
under
the
shadow
of
the
balcony
a
stall
whence
he
could
observe
the
bankshire
box
without
fear
of
detection
ronald
had
never
known
of
his
father
s
presence
at
the
play
and
for
three
blessed
hours
mr
grew
had
watched
his
boy
s
handsome
dark
head
bent
above
the
dense
fair
hair
and
white
averted
shoulder
that
were
all
he
could
catch
of
miss
bankshire
s
beauties
he
recalled
the
vision
now
and
with
it
came
as
usual
its
ghostly
double
the
vision
of
his
young
self
bending
above
such
a
white
shoulder
and
such
shining
hair
needless
to
say
that
the
real
mason
grew
had
never
found
himself
in
so
enviable
a
situation
the
late
mrs
grew
had
no
more
resembled
miss
daisy
bankshire
than
he
had
looked
like
the
happy
victorious
ronald
and
the
mystery
was
that
from
their
dull
faces
their
dull
endearments
the
miracle
of
ronald
should
have
sprung
it
was
almost
fantastically
as
if
the
boy
had
been
a
changeling
child
of
a
latmian
night
whom
the
divine
companion
of
grew
s
early
reveries
had
secretly
laid
in
the
cradle
of
the
wingfield
bedroom
while
and
mrs
grew
slept
the
deep
sleep
of
conjugal
indifference
the
young
mason
grew
had
not
at
first
accepted
this
astral
episode
as
the
complete
cancelling
of
his
claims
on
romance
he
too
had
grasped
at
the
glory
and
with
his
fatal
tendency
to
reach
too
far
when
he
reached
at
all
had
singled
out
the
prettiest
girl
in
wingfield
when
he
recalled
his
stammered
confession
of
love
his
face
still
tingled
under
her
cool
bright
stare
the
wonder
of
his
audacity
had
struck
her
dumb
and
when
she
recovered
her
voice
it
was
to
fling
a
taunt
at
him
don
t
be
too
discouraged
you
know
have
you
ever
thought
of
trying
addie
wicks
all
wingfield
would
have
understood
the
gibe
addie
wicks
was
the
dullest
girl
in
town
and
a
year
later
he
had
married
addie
wicks
he
looked
up
from
the
perusal
of
ronald
s
telegram
with
this
memory
in
his
mind
now
at
last
his
dream
was
coming
true
his
boy
would
taste
of
the
joys
that
had
mocked
his
thwarted
youth
and
his
dull
gray
and
it
was
fitting
that
they
should
be
realized
in
ronald
s
destiny
ronald
was
made
to
take
happiness
boldly
by
the
hand
and
lead
it
home
like
a
bridegroom
he
had
the
carriage
the
confidence
the
high
faith
in
his
fortune
that
compel
the
wilful
stars
and
thanks
to
the
buckle
he
would
have
the
exceptional
setting
the
background
of
material
elegance
that
became
his
conquering
person
since
mr
grew
had
retired
from
business
his
investments
had
prospered
and
he
had
been
saving
up
his
income
for
just
such
a
contingency
his
own
wants
were
few
he
had
transferred
the
wingfield
furniture
to
brooklyn
and
his
was
a
replica
of
that
in
which
the
long
years
of
his
married
life
had
been
spent
even
the
florid
carpet
on
which
ronald
s
tottering
footsteps
had
been
taken
was
carefully
matched
when
it
became
too
threadbare
and
on
the
marble
with
its
cover
and
bunch
of
dyed
pampas
grass
lay
the
illustrated
longfellow
and
the
copy
of
ingersoll
s
lectures
which
represented
literature
to
mr
grew
when
he
had
led
home
his
bride
in
the
light
of
ronald
s
romance
mr
grew
found
himself
with
a
strange
tremor
of
mingled
pain
and
tenderness
all
the
poor
prosaic
incidents
of
his
own
personal
history
curiously
enough
with
this
new
splendor
on
them
they
began
to
emit
a
small
faint
ray
of
their
own
his
wife
s
armchair
in
its
usual
place
by
the
fire
recalled
her
placid
unperceiving
presence
seated
opposite
to
him
during
the
long
drowsy
years
and
he
felt
her
kindness
her
equanimity
where
formerly
he
had
only
ached
at
her
obtuseness
and
from
the
chair
he
glanced
up
at
the
large
discolored
photograph
on
the
wall
above
with
a
brittle
brown
wreath
suspended
on
a
corner
of
the
frame
the
photograph
represented
a
young
man
with
a
poetic
necktie
and
untrammelled
hair
leaning
negligently
against
a
gothic
a
roll
of
music
in
his
hand
and
beneath
was
scrawled
a
bar
of
chopin
with
the
words
adieu
the
portrait
was
that
of
the
great
pianist
fortune
dolbrowski
and
its
presence
on
the
wall
of
grew
s
commemorated
the
only
exquisite
hour
of
his
life
save
that
of
ronald
s
birth
it
was
some
time
before
the
latter
memorable
event
a
few
months
only
after
grew
s
marriage
that
he
had
taken
his
wife
to
new
york
to
hear
the
great
dolbrowski
their
evening
had
been
magically
beautiful
and
even
addie
roused
from
her
habitual
inexpressiveness
had
quivered
into
a
momentary
semblance
of
life
i
never
i
never
she
gasped
out
helplessly
when
they
had
regained
their
hotel
bedroom
and
sat
staring
back
entranced
at
the
evening
s
evocations
her
large
immovable
face
was
pink
and
tremulous
and
she
sat
with
her
hands
on
her
knees
forgetting
to
roll
up
her
and
prepare
her
i
d
like
to
him
just
how
i
felt
i
wisht
i
knew
how
she
burst
out
suddenly
in
a
final
effervescence
of
emotion
her
husband
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
her
would
you
i
feel
that
way
too
he
said
with
a
sheepish
laugh
and
they
continued
to
stare
at
each
other
shyly
through
a
transfiguring
mist
of
sound
mr
grew
recalled
the
scene
as
he
gazed
up
at
the
pianist
s
faded
photograph
well
i
owe
her
that
anyhow
poor
addie
he
said
with
a
smile
at
the
inconsequences
of
fate
with
ronald
s
telegram
in
his
hand
he
was
in
a
mood
to
count
his
mercies
iii
a
clear
thousand
a
year
that
s
what
you
can
tell
em
with
my
compliments
said
mr
grew
glancing
complacently
across
the
at
his
boy
s
charming
face
it
struck
him
that
ronald
s
gift
for
looking
his
part
in
life
had
never
so
romantically
expressed
itself
other
young
men
at
such
a
moment
would
have
been
red
damp
tight
about
the
collar
but
ronald
s
cheek
was
only
a
shade
paler
and
the
contrast
made
his
dark
eyes
more
expressive
a
clear
thousand
yes
sir
that
s
what
i
always
meant
you
to
mr
grew
leaned
back
his
hands
thrust
carelessly
in
his
pockets
as
though
to
divert
attention
from
the
agitation
of
his
features
he
had
often
pictured
himself
rolling
out
that
phrase
to
ronald
and
now
that
it
was
actually
on
his
lips
he
could
not
control
their
tremor
ronald
listened
in
silence
lifting
a
nervous
hand
to
his
slight
dark
moustache
as
though
he
too
wished
to
hide
some
involuntary
betrayal
of
emotion
at
first
mr
grew
took
his
silence
for
an
expression
of
gratified
surprise
but
as
it
prolonged
itself
it
became
less
easy
to
interpret
i
see
here
my
boy
did
you
expect
more
isn
t
it
enough
mr
grew
cleared
his
throat
do
expect
more
he
asked
nervously
he
was
hardly
able
to
face
the
pain
of
inflicting
a
disappointment
on
ronald
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
counted
on
putting
the
final
touch
to
his
felicity
ronald
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
and
his
eyes
wandered
upward
to
the
photograph
of
the
pianist
above
his
father
s
head
it
that
ronald
speak
out
my
boy
we
ll
see
we
ll
look
round
i
ll
manage
no
no
the
young
man
interrupted
abruptly
raising
his
hand
as
though
to
silence
his
father
mr
grew
recovered
his
cheerfulness
well
what
s
the
matter
than
if
willing
ronald
shifted
his
position
again
and
finally
rose
from
his
seat
father
i
there
s
something
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
i
can
t
take
your
mr
grew
sat
speechless
a
moment
staring
blankly
at
his
son
then
he
emitted
a
puzzled
laugh
my
money
what
are
you
talking
about
what
s
this
about
my
money
why
it
ain
t
ronny
it
s
all
yours
every
cent
of
it
he
cried
the
young
man
met
his
tender
look
with
a
gaze
of
tragic
rejection
no
no
it
s
not
mine
not
even
in
the
sense
you
mean
not
in
any
sense
can
t
you
understand
my
feeling
so
feeling
so
i
don
t
know
how
you
re
feeling
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
are
you
too
proud
to
touch
any
money
you
haven
t
earned
is
that
what
you
re
trying
to
tell
me
no
it
s
not
that
you
must
know
mr
grew
flushed
to
the
rim
of
his
bristling
whiskers
know
know
can
t
you
speak
ronald
hesitated
and
the
two
men
faced
each
other
for
a
long
strained
moment
during
which
grew
s
congested
countenance
grew
gradually
pale
again
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
is
it
because
you
ve
done
something
something
you
re
ashamed
of
ashamed
to
tell
me
he
suddenly
gasped
out
and
walking
around
the
table
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
son
s
shoulder
there
s
nothing
you
can
t
tell
me
my
it
s
not
that
why
do
you
make
it
so
hard
for
me
ronald
broke
out
with
passion
you
must
have
known
this
was
sure
to
happen
sooner
or
happen
what
was
sure
to
hap
grew
s
question
wavered
on
his
lip
and
passed
into
a
tremulous
laugh
is
it
something
done
that
you
don
t
approve
of
is
it
is
it
you
re
ashamed
of
ronald
grew
ronald
laughed
too
impatiently
the
buckle
no
i
m
not
ashamed
of
the
buckle
not
any
more
than
you
are
he
returned
with
a
sudden
bright
flush
but
i
m
ashamed
of
all
i
owe
to
it
all
i
owe
to
you
when
when
he
broke
off
and
took
a
few
distracted
steps
across
the
room
you
might
make
this
easier
for
me
he
protested
turning
back
to
his
father
make
what
easier
i
know
less
and
less
what
you
re
driving
at
mr
grew
groaned
ronald
s
walk
had
once
more
brought
him
beneath
the
photograph
on
the
wall
he
lifted
his
head
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
it
then
he
looked
again
at
mr
grew
do
you
suppose
i
haven
t
always
known
known
even
before
you
gave
me
those
letters
after
my
mother
s
death
even
before
that
i
suspected
i
don
t
know
how
it
began
perhaps
from
little
things
you
let
drop
you
and
she
and
resemblances
that
i
couldn
t
help
seeing
in
myself
how
on
earth
could
you
suppose
i
shouldn
t
guess
i
always
thought
you
gave
me
the
letters
as
a
way
of
telling
me
mr
grew
rose
slowly
from
his
chair
the
letters
dolbrowski
s
letters
ronald
nodded
with
white
lips
you
must
remember
giving
them
to
me
the
day
after
the
mr
grew
nodded
back
of
course
i
wanted
you
to
have
everything
your
mother
well
how
could
i
help
knowing
after
that
knowing
mr
grew
stood
staring
helplessly
at
his
son
suddenly
his
look
caught
at
a
clue
that
seemed
to
confront
it
with
a
deeper
bewilderment
you
thought
you
thought
those
letters
dolbrowski
s
letters
you
thought
they
meant
oh
it
wasn
t
only
the
letters
there
were
so
many
other
signs
my
love
of
music
my
all
my
feelings
about
life
and
art
and
when
you
gave
me
the
letters
i
thought
you
must
mean
me
to
mr
grew
had
grown
quiet
his
lips
were
firm
and
his
small
eyes
looked
out
steadily
from
their
creased
lids
to
know
that
you
were
fortune
dolbrowski
s
son
ronald
made
a
mute
sign
of
assent
i
see
and
what
did
you
mean
to
do
i
meant
to
wait
till
i
could
earn
my
living
and
then
repay
you
as
far
as
i
can
ever
repay
you
but
now
that
there
s
a
chance
of
my
marrying
and
your
generosity
overwhelms
me
i
m
obliged
to
i
see
said
mr
grew
again
he
let
himself
down
into
his
chair
looking
steadily
and
not
unkindly
at
the
young
man
sit
down
ronald
let
s
ronald
made
a
protesting
movement
is
anything
to
be
gained
by
it
you
can
t
change
me
change
what
i
feel
the
reading
of
those
letters
transformed
my
whole
life
i
was
a
boy
till
then
they
made
a
man
of
me
from
that
moment
i
understood
he
paused
and
then
looked
up
at
grew
s
face
don
t
imagine
i
don
t
appreciate
your
kindness
your
extraordinary
generosity
but
i
can
t
go
through
life
in
disguise
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
have
not
won
daisy
under
false
pretences
mr
grew
started
up
with
the
first
expletive
ronald
had
ever
heard
on
his
lips
you
damned
young
fool
you
you
haven
t
her
ronald
raised
his
head
quickly
oh
you
don
t
know
her
sir
she
thinks
no
worse
of
me
for
knowing
my
secret
she
is
above
and
beyond
all
such
conventional
prejudices
she
s
of
my
parentage
he
straightened
his
slim
young
shoulders
as
i
m
proud
of
it
yes
sir
proud
of
it
mr
grew
sank
back
into
his
seat
with
a
dry
laugh
well
you
ought
to
be
you
come
of
good
stock
and
you
re
father
s
son
every
inch
of
you
he
laughed
again
as
though
the
humor
of
the
situation
grew
on
him
with
its
closer
contemplation
yes
i
ve
always
felt
that
ronald
murmured
flushing
your
father
s
son
and
no
mr
grew
leaned
forward
you
re
the
son
of
as
big
a
fool
as
yourself
and
here
he
sits
ronald
the
young
man
s
flush
deepened
to
crimson
but
mr
grew
checked
his
reply
with
a
decisive
gesture
here
he
sits
with
all
your
young
nonsense
still
alive
in
him
don
t
you
see
the
likeness
if
you
don
t
i
ll
tell
you
the
story
of
those
ronald
stared
what
do
you
mean
don
t
they
tell
their
own
story
i
supposed
they
did
when
i
gave
them
to
you
but
you
ve
given
it
a
twist
that
needs
straightening
mr
grew
squared
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
looked
at
the
young
man
across
the
and
the
dyed
pampas
grass
i
wrote
all
the
letters
that
dolbrowski
ronald
gave
back
his
look
in
frowning
perplexity
you
wrote
them
i
don
t
understand
his
letters
are
all
addressed
to
my
yes
and
he
thought
he
was
corresponding
with
but
my
mother
what
did
she
think
mr
grew
hesitated
puckering
his
thick
lids
well
i
guess
she
kinder
thought
it
was
a
joke
your
mother
didn
t
think
about
things
ronald
continued
to
bend
a
puzzled
frown
on
the
question
i
don
t
understand
he
reiterated
mr
grew
cleared
his
throat
with
a
nervous
laugh
well
i
don
t
know
as
you
ever
will
but
this
is
the
way
it
came
about
i
had
a
toughish
time
of
it
when
i
was
young
oh
i
don
t
mean
so
much
the
fight
i
had
to
put
up
to
make
my
way
there
was
always
plenty
of
fight
in
me
but
inside
of
myself
it
was
kinder
lonesome
and
the
outside
didn
t
attract
he
laughed
again
with
an
apologetic
gesture
toward
his
broad
blinking
face
when
i
went
round
with
the
other
young
fellows
i
was
always
the
forlorn
hope
the
one
that
had
to
eat
the
drumsticks
and
dance
with
the
as
sure
as
there
was
a
blighter
at
a
picnic
i
had
to
swing
her
and
feed
her
and
drive
her
home
and
all
the
time
i
was
mad
after
all
the
things
you
ve
got
poetry
and
music
and
all
the
business
so
there
were
the
pair
of
us
my
face
and
my
imagination
chained
together
and
fighting
and
hating
each
other
like
poison
then
your
mother
came
along
and
took
pity
on
me
it
sets
up
a
gawky
fellow
to
find
a
girl
who
ain
t
ashamed
to
be
seen
walking
with
him
sundays
and
i
was
grateful
to
your
mother
and
we
got
along
only
i
couldn
t
say
things
to
her
and
she
couldn
t
answer
well
one
day
a
few
months
after
we
were
married
dolbrowski
came
to
new
york
and
the
whole
place
went
wild
about
him
i
d
never
heard
any
good
music
but
i
d
always
had
an
inkling
of
what
it
must
be
like
though
i
couldn
t
tell
you
to
this
day
how
i
knew
well
your
mother
read
about
him
in
the
papers
too
and
she
thought
it
d
be
the
swagger
thing
to
go
to
new
york
and
hear
him
play
so
we
went
i
ll
never
forget
that
evening
your
mother
wasn
t
easily
stirred
up
she
never
seemed
to
need
to
let
off
steam
but
that
night
she
seemed
to
understand
the
way
i
felt
and
when
we
got
back
to
the
hotel
she
said
suddenly
i
d
like
to
tell
him
how
i
feel
i
d
like
to
sit
right
down
and
write
to
would
you
i
said
so
would
there
was
paper
and
pens
there
before
us
and
i
pulled
a
sheet
toward
me
and
began
to
write
is
this
what
you
d
like
to
say
to
him
i
asked
her
when
the
letter
was
done
and
she
got
pink
and
said
i
don
t
understand
it
but
it
s
and
she
copied
it
out
and
signed
her
name
to
it
and
sent
mr
grew
paused
and
ronald
sat
silent
with
lowered
eyes
that
s
how
it
began
and
that
s
where
i
thought
it
would
end
but
it
didn
t
because
dolbrowski
answered
his
first
letter
was
dated
january
i
guess
you
ll
find
i
m
correct
well
i
went
back
to
hear
him
again
and
i
wrote
him
after
the
performance
and
he
answered
again
and
after
that
we
kept
it
up
for
six
months
your
mother
always
copied
the
letters
and
signed
them
she
seemed
to
think
it
was
a
kinder
joke
and
she
was
proud
of
his
answering
my
letters
but
she
never
went
back
to
new
york
to
hear
him
though
i
saved
up
enough
to
give
her
the
treat
again
she
was
too
lazy
and
she
let
me
go
without
her
i
heard
him
three
times
in
new
york
and
in
the
spring
he
came
to
wingfield
and
played
once
at
the
academy
your
mother
was
sick
and
couldn
t
go
so
i
went
alone
after
the
performance
i
meant
to
get
one
of
the
directors
to
take
me
in
to
see
him
but
when
the
time
came
i
just
went
back
home
and
wrote
to
him
instead
and
the
month
after
before
he
went
back
to
europe
he
sent
your
mother
a
last
little
note
and
that
picture
hanging
up
there
mr
grew
paused
again
and
both
men
lifted
their
eyes
to
the
photograph
is
that
all
ronald
slowly
asked
that
s
all
every
bit
of
it
said
mr
grew
and
my
mother
my
mother
never
even
spoke
to
dolbrowski
never
she
never
even
saw
him
but
that
once
in
new
york
at
his
the
blood
crept
again
to
ronald
s
face
are
you
sure
of
that
sir
he
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
sure
as
i
am
that
i
m
sitting
here
why
she
was
too
lazy
to
look
at
his
letters
after
the
first
novelty
wore
off
she
copied
the
answers
just
to
humor
me
but
she
always
said
she
couldn
t
understand
what
we
but
how
could
you
go
on
with
such
a
correspondence
it
s
incredible
mr
grew
looked
at
his
son
thoughtfully
i
suppose
it
is
to
you
you
ve
only
had
to
put
out
your
hand
and
get
the
things
i
was
starving
for
music
and
good
talk
and
ideas
those
letters
gave
me
all
that
you
ve
read
them
and
you
know
that
dolbrowski
was
not
only
a
great
musician
but
a
great
man
there
was
nothing
beautiful
he
didn
t
see
nothing
fine
he
didn
t
feel
for
six
months
i
breathed
his
air
and
i
ve
lived
on
it
ever
since
do
you
begin
to
understand
a
little
now
yes
a
little
but
why
write
in
my
mother
s
name
why
make
it
a
sentimental
correspondence
mr
grew
reddened
to
his
bald
temples
why
i
tell
you
it
began
that
way
as
a
kinder
joke
and
when
i
saw
that
the
first
letter
pleased
and
interested
him
i
was
afraid
to
tell
him
couldn
tell
him
do
you
suppose
he
d
gone
on
writing
if
he
d
ever
seen
me
ronny
ronald
suddenly
looked
at
him
with
new
eyes
but
he
must
have
thought
your
letters
very
beautiful
to
go
on
as
he
did
he
broke
out
well
i
did
my
best
said
mr
grew
modestly
ronald
pursued
his
idea
where
all
your
letters
i
wonder
weren
t
they
returned
to
you
at
his
death
mr
grew
laughed
lord
no
i
guess
he
had
trunks
and
trunks
full
of
better
ones
i
guess
queens
and
empresses
wrote
to
i
should
have
liked
to
see
your
letters
the
young
man
insisted
well
they
weren
t
bad
said
mr
grew
drily
but
i
ll
tell
you
one
thing
ronny
he
added
suddenly
ronald
raised
his
head
with
a
quick
glance
and
mr
grew
continued
i
ll
tell
you
where
the
best
of
those
letters
is
it
s
in
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
one
look
at
life
i
couldn
t
have
made
you
what
you
are
oh
i
know
you
ve
done
a
good
deal
of
your
own
making
but
i
ve
been
there
behind
you
all
the
time
and
you
ll
never
know
the
work
i
ve
spared
you
and
the
time
i
ve
saved
you
fortune
dolbrowski
helped
me
do
that
i
never
saw
things
in
little
again
after
i
d
looked
at
em
with
him
and
i
tried
to
give
you
the
big
view
from
the
stars
so
that
s
what
became
of
my
mr
grew
paused
and
for
a
long
time
ronald
sat
motionless
his
elbows
on
the
table
his
face
dropped
on
his
hands
suddenly
grew
s
touch
fell
on
his
shoulder
look
at
here
ronald
grew
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
how
you
re
feeling
at
this
minute
just
a
mite
let
down
after
all
at
the
idea
that
you
ain
t
the
romantic
figure
you
d
got
to
think
yourself
well
that
s
natural
enough
too
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
proves
it
proves
you
re
my
son
right
enough
if
any
more
proof
was
needed
for
it
s
just
the
kind
of
fool
nonsense
i
used
to
feel
at
your
age
and
if
there
s
anybody
here
to
laugh
at
it
s
myself
and
not
you
and
you
can
laugh
at
me
just
as
much
as
you
like
the
daunt
diana
i
what
s
become
of
the
daunt
diana
you
mean
to
say
you
never
heard
the
sequel
ringham
finney
threw
himself
back
into
his
chair
with
the
smile
of
the
collector
who
has
a
good
thing
to
show
he
knew
he
had
a
good
listener
at
any
rate
i
don
t
think
much
of
ringham
s
but
his
anecdotes
are
usually
worth
while
he
s
a
psychologist
astray
among
and
the
best
bits
he
brings
back
from
his
raids
on
christie
s
and
the
hotel
drouot
are
the
fragments
of
human
nature
he
picks
up
on
those
historic
if
his
in
enamel
had
been
half
as
good
we
should
have
heard
of
the
finney
collection
by
this
time
he
really
has
queer
fatuous
investigator
an
unusually
sensitive
touch
for
the
human
texture
and
the
specimens
he
gathers
into
his
museum
of
heterogeneous
memories
have
almost
always
some
mark
of
the
rare
and
chosen
i
felt
therefore
that
i
was
really
to
be
congratulated
on
the
fact
that
i
didn
t
know
what
had
become
of
the
daunt
diana
and
on
having
before
me
a
long
evening
in
which
to
learn
i
had
just
led
my
friend
back
after
an
excellent
dinner
at
foyot
s
to
the
shabby
pleasant
of
my
hotel
and
i
knew
that
once
i
had
settled
him
in
a
good
and
put
a
box
of
cigars
at
his
elbow
i
could
trust
him
not
to
budge
till
i
had
the
story
ii
you
remember
old
neave
of
course
little
humphrey
neave
i
mean
we
used
to
see
him
pottering
about
rome
years
ago
he
lived
in
two
tiny
rooms
over
a
wine
shop
on
polenta
and
lentils
and
prowled
among
the
refuse
of
the
ripetta
whenever
he
had
a
few
to
spend
but
you
ve
been
out
of
the
collector
s
world
for
so
long
that
you
may
not
know
what
happened
to
him
afterward
he
was
always
a
queer
chap
neave
years
older
than
you
and
me
of
course
and
even
when
i
first
knew
him
in
my
raw
roman
days
he
gave
me
an
extraordinary
sense
of
age
and
experience
i
don
t
think
i
ve
ever
known
any
one
who
was
at
once
so
intelligent
and
so
simple
it
s
the
precise
combination
that
results
in
romance
and
poor
little
neave
was
romantic
he
told
me
once
how
he
d
come
to
rome
he
was
of
mystic
connecticut
and
he
wanted
to
get
as
far
away
from
it
as
possible
rome
seemed
as
far
as
anything
on
the
same
planet
could
be
and
after
he
d
worried
his
way
through
harvard
with
shifts
and
shavings
that
you
and
i
can
t
imagine
he
contrived
to
get
sent
to
switzerland
as
tutor
to
a
chap
who
d
failed
in
his
examinations
with
only
the
alps
between
he
wasn
t
likely
to
turn
back
and
he
got
another
fellow
to
take
his
pupil
home
and
struck
out
on
foot
for
the
seven
hills
i
m
telling
you
these
early
details
merely
to
give
you
a
notion
of
the
man
s
idealism
there
was
a
cool
persistency
and
a
headlong
courage
in
his
dash
for
rome
that
one
wouldn
t
have
guessed
in
the
little
pottering
chap
we
used
to
know
once
on
the
spot
he
got
more
tutoring
managed
to
make
himself
a
name
for
coaxing
balky
youths
to
take
their
fences
and
was
finally
able
to
take
up
the
more
congenial
task
of
expounding
the
antiquities
to
cultured
travellers
i
call
it
more
congenial
but
how
it
must
have
seared
his
soul
fancy
unveiling
the
sacred
scars
of
time
to
ladies
who
murmur
was
this
the
spot
while
they
absently
feel
for
their
hatpins
he
used
to
say
that
nothing
kept
him
at
it
but
the
exquisite
thought
of
accumulating
the
for
his
collection
for
the
neave
collection
my
dear
fellow
began
early
began
almost
with
his
roman
life
began
in
a
series
of
little
nameless
odds
and
ends
broken
trinkets
torn
embroideries
the
amputated
extremities
of
maimed
marbles
things
that
even
the
had
pitched
away
when
he
sifted
his
haul
but
they
weren
t
nameless
or
meaningless
to
neave
his
strength
lay
in
his
instinct
for
identifying
putting
together
seeing
significant
relations
he
was
a
regular
cuvier
of
and
during
those
early
years
when
he
had
time
to
brood
over
trifles
and
note
imperceptible
differences
he
gradually
sharpened
his
instinct
and
made
it
into
the
delicate
and
redoubtable
instrument
it
is
before
he
had
a
thousand
francs
worth
of
to
his
name
he
began
to
be
known
as
an
expert
and
the
big
dealers
were
glad
to
consult
him
but
we
re
getting
no
nearer
the
daunt
diana
well
some
fifteen
years
ago
in
london
i
ran
across
neave
at
christie
s
he
was
the
same
little
man
we
d
known
effaced
bleached
indistinct
like
a
poor
impression
as
unnoticeable
as
one
of
his
own
early
finds
yet
like
them
with
a
if
one
had
an
eye
for
it
he
told
me
he
still
lived
in
rome
and
had
contrived
by
fierce
to
get
a
few
decent
bits
together
piecemeal
little
by
little
with
fasting
and
prayer
and
i
mean
the
fasting
literally
he
said
he
had
run
over
to
london
for
his
annual
i
fancy
one
or
another
of
the
big
collectors
usually
paid
his
journey
and
when
we
met
he
was
on
his
way
to
see
the
daunt
collection
you
know
old
daunt
was
a
surly
brute
and
the
things
weren
t
easily
seen
but
he
had
heard
neave
was
in
london
and
had
sent
yes
actually
sent
for
him
to
come
and
give
his
opinion
on
a
few
bits
including
the
diana
the
little
man
bore
himself
discreetly
but
you
can
imagine
his
pride
in
his
exultation
he
asked
me
to
come
with
him
oh
i
ve
the
et
petites
my
dear
fellow
i
ve
made
my
conditions
and
so
it
happened
that
i
saw
the
first
meeting
between
humphrey
neave
and
his
fate
for
that
collection
his
fate
or
one
may
say
it
was
embodied
in
the
diana
who
was
queen
and
goddess
of
the
realm
yes
i
shall
always
be
glad
i
was
with
neave
when
he
had
his
first
look
at
the
diana
i
see
him
now
blinking
at
her
through
his
white
lashes
and
stroking
his
seedy
wisp
of
a
moustache
to
hide
a
twitch
of
the
muscles
it
was
all
very
quiet
but
it
was
the
de
i
could
see
that
by
the
way
his
hands
trembled
when
he
turned
away
and
began
to
examine
the
other
things
you
remember
neave
s
hands
thin
sallow
dry
with
long
inquisitive
fingers
thrown
out
like
antennae
whatever
they
hold
bronze
or
lace
hard
enamel
or
brittle
glass
they
have
an
air
of
conforming
themselves
to
the
texture
of
the
thing
and
sucking
out
of
it
by
every
the
mysterious
essence
it
has
secreted
well
that
day
as
he
moved
about
among
daunt
s
treasures
the
diana
followed
him
everywhere
he
didn
t
look
back
at
her
he
gave
himself
to
the
business
he
was
there
for
but
whatever
he
touched
he
felt
her
and
on
the
threshold
he
turned
and
gave
her
his
first
free
look
the
kind
of
look
that
says
you
re
it
amused
me
at
the
time
the
idea
of
little
neave
making
eyes
at
any
of
daunt
s
belongings
he
might
as
well
have
coquetted
with
the
kohinoor
and
the
same
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
for
as
we
turned
away
from
the
big
house
in
belgravia
he
glanced
up
at
it
and
said
with
a
bitterness
i
d
never
heard
in
him
good
lord
to
think
of
that
lumpy
fool
having
those
things
to
handle
did
you
notice
his
stupid
stumps
of
fingers
i
suppose
he
blunted
them
gouging
nuggets
out
of
the
gold
fields
and
in
exchange
for
the
nuggets
he
gets
all
that
in
a
year
only
has
to
hold
out
his
callous
palm
to
have
that
great
ripe
sphere
of
beauty
drop
into
it
that
s
my
idea
of
heaven
to
have
a
great
collection
drop
into
one
s
hand
as
success
or
love
or
any
of
the
big
shining
things
drop
suddenly
on
some
men
and
i
ve
had
to
worry
along
for
nearly
fifty
years
saving
and
paring
and
haggling
and
intriguing
to
get
here
a
bit
and
there
a
bit
and
not
one
perfection
in
the
lot
it
s
enough
to
poison
a
man
s
the
outbreak
was
so
unlike
neave
that
i
remember
every
word
of
it
remember
too
saying
in
answer
but
look
here
neave
you
wouldn
t
take
daunt
s
hands
for
yours
i
imagine
he
stared
a
moment
and
smiled
have
all
that
and
grope
my
way
through
it
like
a
blind
cave
fish
what
a
question
but
the
sense
that
it
s
always
the
blind
fish
that
live
in
that
kind
of
aquarium
is
what
makes
anarchists
sir
he
looked
back
from
the
corner
of
the
square
where
we
had
paused
while
he
delivered
himself
of
this
remarkable
metaphor
god
i
d
like
to
throw
a
bomb
at
that
place
and
be
in
at
the
looting
and
with
that
on
the
way
home
he
unpacked
his
grievance
pulled
the
bandage
off
the
wound
and
showed
me
the
ugly
mark
it
had
made
on
his
little
white
soul
it
wasn
t
the
struggling
stinting
that
galled
him
it
was
the
inadequacy
of
the
result
it
was
in
short
the
old
tragedy
of
the
discrepancy
between
a
man
s
wants
and
his
power
to
gratify
them
neave
s
taste
was
too
exquisite
for
his
means
was
like
some
strange
delicate
capricious
animal
that
he
cherished
and
pampered
and
couldn
t
satisfy
don
t
you
know
those
little
glittering
lizards
that
die
if
they
re
not
fed
on
some
wonderful
tropical
fly
well
my
taste
s
like
that
with
one
important
difference
if
it
doesn
t
get
its
fly
it
simply
turns
and
feeds
on
me
oh
it
doesn
t
die
my
taste
worse
luck
it
gets
larger
and
stronger
and
more
fastidious
and
takes
a
bigger
bite
of
me
that
s
that
was
all
year
by
year
day
by
day
he
had
made
himself
into
this
delicate
register
of
perceptions
and
sensations
as
far
above
the
ordinary
human
faculty
of
appreciation
as
some
scientific
registering
instrument
is
beyond
the
rough
human
senses
only
to
find
that
the
beauty
which
alone
could
satisfy
him
was
unattainable
that
he
was
never
to
know
the
last
deep
identification
which
only
possession
can
give
he
had
trained
himself
in
short
to
feel
in
the
rare
great
thing
such
an
utterance
of
beauty
as
the
daunt
diana
say
a
hundred
elements
of
perfection
a
hundred
imperceptible
inexplicable
even
to
the
average
artistic
sense
he
had
reached
this
point
by
a
long
austere
process
of
discrimination
and
rejection
the
renewed
great
refusals
of
the
intelligence
which
perpetually
asks
more
which
will
make
no
pact
with
its
self
of
yesterday
and
is
never
to
be
beguiled
from
its
purpose
by
the
wiles
of
the
oh
it
s
a
poignant
case
but
not
a
common
one
for
the
usually
wins
you
see
the
worst
of
neave
s
state
was
the
fact
of
his
not
being
a
mere
collector
even
the
collector
raised
to
his
highest
pitch
of
efficiency
the
whole
thing
was
blent
in
him
with
poetry
his
imagination
had
romanticized
the
acquisitive
instinct
as
the
religious
feeling
of
the
middle
ages
turned
passion
into
love
and
yet
his
could
never
be
the
abstract
enjoyment
of
the
philosopher
who
says
this
or
that
object
is
really
mine
because
i
m
capable
of
appreciating
neave
what
he
appreciated
wanted
it
with
his
touch
and
his
sight
as
well
as
with
his
imagination
it
was
hardly
a
year
afterward
that
coming
back
from
a
long
tour
in
india
i
picked
up
a
london
paper
and
read
the
amazing
headline
mr
humphrey
neave
buys
the
daunt
collection
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
read
again
yes
it
could
only
be
our
old
friend
humphrey
an
american
living
in
rome
one
of
our
most
discerning
collectors
there
was
no
mistaking
the
description
i
clapped
on
my
hat
and
bolted
out
to
see
the
first
dealer
i
could
find
and
there
i
had
the
incredible
details
neave
had
come
into
a
fortune
two
or
three
million
dollars
amassed
by
an
uncle
who
had
a
and
who
had
attained
wealth
as
the
creator
of
the
mystic
sounds
odd
by
the
way
doesn
t
it
one
had
fancied
that
the
corset
was
a
personal
a
highly
specialized
garment
more
or
less
shaped
on
the
form
it
was
to
modify
but
after
all
the
tanagras
were
all
made
from
two
or
three
moulds
and
so
i
suppose
are
the
ladies
who
wear
the
mystic
the
uncle
had
a
son
and
neave
had
never
dreamed
of
seeing
a
penny
of
the
money
but
the
son
died
suddenly
and
the
father
followed
leaving
a
codicil
that
gave
everything
to
our
friend
humphrey
had
to
go
out
to
realize
on
the
and
his
description
of
well
he
came
back
with
his
money
in
his
pocket
and
the
day
he
landed
old
daunt
went
to
smash
it
all
fitted
in
like
a
chinese
puzzle
i
believe
neave
drove
straight
from
euston
to
daunt
house
at
any
rate
within
two
months
the
collection
was
his
and
at
a
price
that
made
the
trade
sit
up
trust
old
daunt
for
that
i
was
in
rome
the
following
spring
and
you
d
better
believe
i
looked
him
up
a
big
porter
glared
at
me
from
the
door
of
the
palazzo
neave
i
had
almost
to
produce
my
passport
to
get
in
but
that
wasn
t
neave
s
fault
the
poor
fellow
was
so
beset
by
people
clamouring
to
see
his
collection
that
he
had
to
barricade
himself
literally
when
i
had
mounted
the
state
and
come
on
him
at
the
end
of
half
a
dozen
echoing
saloons
in
the
farthest
smallest
of
the
vast
suite
i
received
the
same
welcome
that
he
used
to
give
us
in
his
little
den
over
the
wine
shop
well
so
you
ve
got
her
i
said
for
i
d
caught
sight
of
the
diana
in
passing
against
the
bluish
blur
of
an
old
just
the
background
for
her
poised
loveliness
only
i
rather
wondered
why
she
wasn
t
in
the
room
where
he
sat
he
smiled
yes
i
ve
got
her
he
returned
more
calmly
than
i
had
expected
and
all
the
rest
of
the
loot
yes
i
had
to
buy
the
had
to
but
you
wanted
to
didn
t
you
you
used
to
say
it
was
your
idea
of
heaven
to
stretch
out
your
hand
and
have
a
great
ripe
sphere
of
beauty
drop
into
it
i
m
quoting
your
own
words
by
the
neave
blinked
and
stroked
his
seedy
moustache
oh
yes
i
remember
the
phrase
it
s
true
it
the
last
he
paused
as
if
seeking
a
pretext
for
his
lack
of
warmth
the
thing
that
bothered
me
was
having
to
move
i
couldn
t
cram
all
the
stuff
into
my
old
well
i
should
say
not
this
is
rather
a
better
he
got
up
come
and
take
a
look
round
i
want
to
show
you
two
or
three
things
new
attributions
i
ve
made
i
m
doing
the
catalogue
the
interest
of
showing
me
the
things
seemed
to
dispel
the
vague
apathy
i
had
felt
in
him
he
grew
keen
again
in
detailing
his
redistribution
of
values
and
above
all
in
convicting
old
daunt
and
his
advisers
of
their
repeated
aberrations
of
judgment
the
miracle
is
that
he
should
have
got
such
things
knowing
as
little
as
he
did
what
he
was
getting
and
the
egregious
asses
who
bought
for
him
were
no
better
were
worse
in
fact
since
they
had
all
sorts
of
humbugging
wrong
reasons
for
admiring
what
old
daunt
simply
coveted
because
it
belonged
to
some
other
rich
never
had
neave
had
so
wondrous
a
field
for
the
exercise
of
his
perfected
faculty
and
i
saw
then
how
in
the
real
the
great
collector
s
appreciations
the
keenest
scientific
perception
is
suffused
with
imaginative
sensibility
and
how
it
s
to
the
latter
undefinable
quality
that
in
the
last
resort
he
trusts
himself
nevertheless
i
still
felt
the
shadow
of
that
hovering
apathy
and
he
knew
i
felt
it
and
was
always
breaking
off
to
give
me
reasons
for
it
for
one
thing
he
wasn
t
used
to
his
new
quarters
hated
their
bigness
and
formality
then
the
requests
to
show
his
things
drove
him
mad
the
women
oh
the
women
he
wailed
and
interrupted
himself
to
describe
a
german
princess
who
had
marched
past
his
treasures
as
if
she
were
inspecting
a
cavalry
regiment
applying
an
unmodulated
to
everything
from
the
engraved
gems
to
the
hercules
torso
not
that
she
was
half
as
bad
as
the
other
kind
he
added
as
if
with
a
last
effort
at
optimism
the
kind
who
discriminate
and
say
i
m
not
sure
if
it
s
botticelli
or
cellini
i
mean
but
of
that
at
any
and
the
worst
of
all
are
the
ones
who
know
up
to
a
certain
point
have
the
schools
and
the
dates
and
the
jargon
pat
and
yet
wouldn
t
know
a
phidias
if
it
stood
where
they
hadn
t
expected
he
had
all
my
sympathy
poor
neave
yet
these
were
trials
inseparable
from
the
collector
s
lot
and
not
always
without
their
secret
compensations
certainly
they
did
not
wholly
explain
my
friend
s
attitude
and
for
a
moment
i
wondered
if
it
were
due
to
some
strange
disillusionment
as
to
the
quality
of
his
treasures
but
no
the
daunt
collection
was
almost
above
criticism
and
as
we
passed
from
one
object
to
another
i
saw
there
was
no
mistaking
the
genuineness
of
neave
s
pride
in
his
possessions
the
ripe
sphere
of
beauty
was
his
and
he
had
found
no
flaw
in
it
as
yet
a
year
later
came
the
amazing
announcement
the
daunt
collection
was
for
sale
at
first
we
all
supposed
it
was
a
case
of
weeding
out
though
how
old
daunt
would
have
raged
at
the
thought
of
anybody
s
weeding
collection
but
no
the
catalogue
corrected
that
idea
every
stick
and
stone
was
to
go
under
the
hammer
the
news
ran
like
wildfire
from
rome
to
berlin
from
paris
to
london
and
new
york
was
neave
ruined
then
wrong
again
the
dealers
nosed
that
out
in
no
time
he
was
simply
selling
because
he
chose
to
sell
and
in
due
time
the
things
came
up
at
christie
s
but
you
may
be
sure
the
trade
had
found
an
answer
to
the
riddle
and
the
answer
was
that
on
close
inspection
neave
had
found
the
collection
less
impeccable
than
he
had
supposed
it
was
a
preposterous
answer
but
then
there
was
no
other
neave
by
this
time
was
pretty
generally
recognized
as
having
the
subtlest
of
any
collector
in
europe
and
if
he
didn
t
choose
to
keep
the
daunt
collection
it
could
be
only
because
he
had
reason
to
think
he
could
do
better
in
a
flash
this
report
had
gone
the
rounds
and
the
buyers
were
on
their
guard
i
had
run
over
to
london
to
see
the
thing
through
and
it
was
the
queerest
sale
i
ever
was
at
some
of
the
things
held
their
own
but
a
lot
and
a
few
of
the
best
among
them
went
for
half
their
value
you
see
they
d
been
locked
up
in
old
daunt
s
house
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
hardly
shown
to
any
one
so
that
the
whole
younger
generation
of
dealers
and
collectors
knew
of
them
only
by
hearsay
then
you
know
the
effect
of
suggestion
in
such
cases
the
undefinable
sense
we
were
speaking
of
is
a
ticklish
instrument
easily
thrown
out
of
gear
by
a
sudden
fall
of
temperature
and
the
sharpest
experts
grow
shy
and
when
the
cold
current
of
depreciation
touches
them
the
sale
was
a
slaughter
and
when
i
saw
the
daunt
diana
fall
at
the
wink
of
a
little
from
vienna
i
turned
sick
at
the
folly
of
my
kind
for
my
part
i
had
never
believed
that
neave
had
sold
the
collection
because
he
d
found
it
out
and
within
a
year
my
incredulity
was
justified
as
soon
as
the
things
were
put
in
circulation
they
were
known
for
the
marvels
they
are
there
was
hardly
a
poor
bit
in
the
lot
and
my
wonder
grew
at
neave
s
madness
all
over
europe
dealers
began
to
be
fighting
for
the
spoils
and
all
kinds
of
stuff
were
palmed
off
on
the
unsuspecting
as
fragments
of
the
daunt
collection
meanwhile
what
was
neave
doing
for
a
long
time
i
didn
t
hear
and
chance
kept
me
from
returning
to
rome
but
one
day
in
paris
i
ran
across
a
dealer
who
had
captured
for
a
song
one
of
the
best
florentine
bronzes
in
the
daunt
collection
a
marvellous
of
donatello
s
i
asked
him
what
had
become
of
it
and
he
said
with
a
grin
i
sold
it
the
other
day
naming
a
price
that
staggered
me
ye
gods
who
paid
you
that
for
it
his
grin
broadened
and
he
answered
neave
humphrey
neave
didn
t
you
know
he
was
buying
back
his
things
nonsense
he
is
though
not
in
his
own
name
but
he
s
doing
and
he
do
you
know
and
at
prices
that
would
have
made
a
sane
man
shudder
a
few
weeks
later
i
ran
across
his
tracks
in
london
where
he
was
trying
to
get
hold
of
a
penicaud
enamel
another
of
his
scattered
treasures
then
i
hunted
him
down
at
his
hotel
and
had
it
out
with
him
look
here
neave
what
are
you
up
to
he
wouldn
t
tell
me
at
first
stared
and
laughed
and
denied
but
i
took
him
off
to
dine
and
after
dinner
while
we
smoked
i
happened
to
mention
casually
that
i
had
a
pull
over
the
man
who
had
the
penicaud
and
at
that
he
broke
down
and
confessed
yes
i
m
buying
them
back
finney
it
s
he
laughed
nervously
twitching
his
moustache
and
then
he
let
me
have
the
story
you
know
how
i
d
hungered
and
thirsted
for
the
you
quoted
my
own
phrase
to
me
once
about
the
ripe
sphere
of
so
when
i
got
my
money
and
daunt
lost
his
almost
at
the
same
moment
i
saw
the
hand
of
providence
in
it
i
knew
that
even
if
i
d
been
younger
and
had
more
time
i
could
never
hope
nowadays
to
form
such
a
collection
as
there
was
the
ripe
sphere
within
reach
and
i
took
it
but
when
i
got
it
and
began
to
live
with
it
i
found
out
my
mistake
it
was
a
de
there
d
been
no
wooing
no
winning
each
of
my
little
old
bits
the
rubbish
i
chucked
out
to
make
room
for
daunt
s
glories
had
its
own
personal
history
the
drama
of
my
relation
to
it
of
the
discovery
the
struggle
the
capture
the
first
divine
moment
of
possession
there
was
a
romantic
secret
between
us
and
then
i
had
absorbed
its
beauties
one
by
one
they
had
become
a
part
of
my
imagination
they
held
me
by
a
hundred
threads
of
association
and
suddenly
i
had
expected
to
create
this
kind
of
intense
personal
tie
between
myself
and
a
roomful
of
new
cold
alien
presences
things
staring
at
me
vacantly
from
the
depths
of
unknown
pasts
can
you
fancy
a
more
preposterous
hope
why
my
other
things
my
things
had
wooed
me
as
passionately
as
i
wooed
them
there
was
a
certain
little
bronze
a
little
venus
callipyge
who
had
drawn
me
drawn
me
drawn
me
imploring
me
to
rescue
her
from
her
unspeakable
surroundings
in
a
vulgar
shop
at
biarritz
where
she
shrank
out
of
sight
among
sham
sevres
and
dutch
silver
as
one
has
seen
certain
women
rare
shy
exquisite
made
almost
invisible
by
the
vulgar
splendours
surrounding
them
well
that
little
venus
who
was
just
a
specious
seventeenth
century
attempt
at
the
antique
but
who
had
penetrated
me
with
her
pleading
grace
touched
me
by
the
easily
guessed
story
of
her
obscure
anonymous
origin
was
more
to
me
imaginatively
yes
more
than
the
cold
bought
beauty
of
the
daunt
diana
the
daunt
diana
i
broke
in
hold
up
neave
daunt
diana
he
smiled
contemptuously
a
professional
beauty
my
dear
fellow
expected
every
head
to
be
turned
when
she
came
into
a
oh
neave
i
groaned
yes
i
know
you
re
thinking
of
what
we
felt
that
day
we
first
saw
her
in
london
many
a
poor
devil
has
sold
his
soul
as
the
result
of
such
a
first
sight
well
i
sold
instead
do
you
want
the
truth
about
her
etait
bete
a
he
laughed
and
stood
up
with
a
little
shrug
of
disenchantment
and
so
you
re
impenitent
i
paused
and
yet
you
re
buying
some
of
the
things
back
neave
laughed
again
ironically
i
knew
you
d
find
me
out
and
call
me
to
account
well
yes
i
m
buying
he
stood
before
me
half
sheepish
half
defiant
i
m
buying
back
because
there
s
nothing
else
as
good
in
the
market
and
because
i
ve
a
queer
feeling
that
this
time
they
ll
be
but
i
m
ruining
myself
at
the
game
he
confessed
it
was
true
neave
was
ruining
himself
and
he
s
gone
on
ruining
himself
ever
since
till
now
the
job
s
nearly
done
bit
by
bit
year
by
year
he
has
gathered
in
his
scattered
treasures
at
higher
prices
than
the
dealers
ever
dreamed
of
getting
there
are
fabulous
details
in
the
story
of
his
quest
now
and
then
i
ran
across
him
and
was
able
to
help
him
recover
a
fragment
and
it
was
wonderful
to
see
his
delight
in
the
moment
of
reunion
finally
about
two
years
ago
we
met
in
paris
and
he
told
me
he
had
got
back
all
the
important
pieces
except
the
diana
the
diana
but
you
told
me
you
didn
t
care
for
didn
t
care
he
leaned
across
the
restaurant
table
that
divided
us
well
no
in
a
sense
i
didn
t
i
wanted
her
to
want
me
you
see
and
she
didn
t
then
whereas
now
she
s
crying
to
me
to
come
to
her
you
know
where
she
is
he
broke
off
yes
i
knew
in
the
centre
of
willy
goldmark
s
yellow
and
gold
under
a
chandelier
with
reflectors
aimed
at
her
from
every
point
of
the
compass
i
had
seen
her
wincing
and
shivering
there
in
her
outraged
nudity
at
one
of
the
goldmark
but
you
can
t
get
her
neave
i
objected
no
i
can
t
get
her
he
said
well
last
month
i
was
in
rome
for
the
first
time
in
six
or
seven
years
and
of
course
i
looked
about
for
neave
the
palazzo
neave
was
let
to
some
rich
russians
and
the
splendid
new
porter
didn
t
know
where
the
proprietor
lived
but
i
got
on
his
trail
easily
enough
and
it
led
me
to
a
strange
old
place
in
the
trastevere
an
ancient
crevassed
black
palace
turned
tenement
house
and
fluttering
with
pauper
i
found
neave
under
the
leads
in
two
or
three
cold
rooms
that
smelt
of
the
of
all
his
neighbours
a
poor
shrunken
little
figure
seedier
and
shabbier
than
ever
yet
more
alive
than
when
we
had
made
the
tour
of
his
collection
in
the
palazzo
neave
the
collection
was
around
him
again
not
displayed
in
tall
cabinets
and
on
marble
tables
but
huddled
on
shelves
perched
on
chairs
crammed
in
corners
putting
the
gleam
of
bronze
the
opalescence
of
old
glass
the
pale
lustre
of
marble
into
all
the
angles
of
his
low
dim
rooms
there
they
were
the
proud
presences
that
had
stared
at
him
down
the
vistas
of
daunt
house
and
shone
in
cold
transplanted
beauty
under
his
own
painted
cornices
there
they
were
gathered
in
humble
promiscuity
about
his
bent
shabby
figure
like
superb
wild
creatures
tamed
to
become
the
familiars
of
some
harmless
old
wizard
as
we
went
from
bit
to
bit
as
he
lifted
one
piece
after
another
and
held
it
to
the
light
of
his
low
windows
i
saw
in
his
hands
the
same
tremor
of
sensation
that
i
had
noticed
when
he
first
examined
the
same
objects
at
daunt
house
all
his
life
was
in
his
and
it
seemed
to
communicate
life
to
the
exquisite
things
he
touched
but
you
ll
think
me
infected
by
his
mysticism
if
i
tell
you
they
gained
new
beauty
while
he
held
them
we
went
the
rounds
slowly
and
reverently
and
then
when
i
supposed
our
inspection
was
over
and
was
turning
to
take
my
leave
he
opened
a
door
i
had
not
noticed
and
showed
me
into
a
slit
of
a
room
beyond
it
was
a
mere
monastic
cell
scarcely
large
enough
for
his
narrow
iron
bed
and
the
chest
which
probably
held
his
few
clothes
but
there
in
a
niche
of
the
bare
wall
facing
the
foot
of
the
bed
there
stood
the
daunt
diana
i
gasped
at
the
sight
and
turned
to
him
and
he
looked
back
at
me
without
speaking
in
the
name
of
magic
neave
how
did
you
do
it
he
smiled
as
if
from
the
depths
of
some
secret
rapture
call
it
magic
if
you
like
but
i
ruined
myself
doing
it
he
said
i
stared
at
him
in
silence
breathless
with
the
madness
and
the
wonder
of
it
and
suddenly
red
to
the
ears
he
flung
out
his
boyish
confession
i
lied
to
you
that
day
in
london
the
day
i
said
i
didn
t
care
for
her
i
always
cared
always
worshipped
always
wanted
her
but
she
wasn
t
mine
then
and
i
knew
it
and
she
knew
it
and
now
at
last
we
understand
each
he
looked
at
me
shyly
and
then
glanced
about
the
bare
cold
cell
the
setting
isn
t
worthy
of
her
i
know
she
was
meant
for
glories
i
can
t
give
her
but
beautiful
things
my
dear
finney
like
beautiful
spirits
live
in
houses
not
made
with
hands
his
face
shone
with
extraordinary
sweetness
as
he
spoke
and
i
saw
he
d
got
hold
of
the
secret
we
re
all
after
no
the
setting
isn
t
worthy
of
her
if
you
like
the
rooms
are
as
shabby
and
mean
as
those
we
used
to
see
him
in
years
ago
over
the
wine
shop
i
m
not
sure
they
re
not
shabbier
and
meaner
but
she
rules
there
at
last
she
shines
and
hovers
there
above
him
and
there
at
night
i
doubt
not
steals
down
from
her
cloud
to
give
him
the
latmian
kiss
the
debt
i
you
remember
it
s
not
so
long
ago
the
talk
there
was
about
dredge
s
arrival
of
the
fittest
the
talk
has
subsided
but
the
book
of
course
remains
stands
up
in
fact
as
the
tallest
thing
of
its
kind
since
well
i
d
almost
said
since
the
origin
of
i
m
not
wrong
at
any
rate
in
calling
it
the
most
important
contribution
yet
made
to
the
development
of
the
darwinian
theory
or
rather
to
the
solution
of
the
awkward
problem
about
which
that
theory
has
had
to
make
such
a
circuit
dredge
s
hypothesis
will
be
contested
may
one
day
be
disproved
but
at
least
it
has
swept
out
of
the
way
all
previous
conjectures
including
of
course
lanfear
s
magnificent
attempt
and
for
our
generation
of
scientific
investigators
it
will
serve
as
the
first
safe
bridge
across
a
murderous
black
whirlpool
it
s
all
very
interesting
there
are
few
things
more
stirring
to
the
imagination
than
that
sudden
projection
of
the
new
hypothesis
light
as
a
cobweb
and
strong
as
steel
across
the
intellectual
abyss
but
for
an
idle
observer
of
human
motives
the
other
the
personal
side
of
dredge
s
case
is
even
more
interesting
and
arresting
personal
side
you
didn
t
know
there
was
one
pictured
him
simply
as
a
thinking
machine
a
highly
specialized
instrument
of
precision
the
result
of
a
long
series
of
adaptations
as
his
own
jargon
would
put
it
well
i
don
t
wonder
if
you
ve
met
him
he
does
give
the
impression
of
being
something
out
of
his
own
laboratory
a
delicate
scientific
instrument
that
reveals
wonders
to
the
initiated
and
is
absolutely
useless
in
an
ordinary
hand
in
his
youth
it
was
just
the
other
way
i
knew
him
twenty
years
ago
as
an
awkward
lout
whom
young
archie
lanfear
had
picked
up
at
college
and
brought
home
for
a
visit
i
happened
to
be
staying
at
the
lanfears
when
the
boys
arrived
and
i
shall
never
forget
dredge
s
first
appearance
on
the
scene
you
know
the
lanfears
always
lived
very
simply
that
summer
they
had
gone
to
buzzard
s
bay
in
order
that
professor
lanfear
might
be
near
the
biological
station
at
wood
s
holl
and
they
were
picnicking
in
a
kind
of
sketchy
bungalow
without
any
attempt
at
elegance
but
galen
dredge
couldn
t
have
been
more
if
he
d
been
suddenly
plunged
into
a
fifth
avenue
he
nearly
knocked
his
shock
head
against
the
low
doorway
and
in
dodging
this
peril
trod
heavily
on
mabel
lanfear
s
foot
and
became
hopelessly
entangled
in
her
mother
s
draperies
though
how
he
managed
it
i
never
knew
for
lanfear
s
dowdy
muslins
ran
to
no
excess
of
train
when
the
professor
himself
came
in
it
was
ten
times
worse
and
i
saw
then
that
dredge
s
emotion
was
a
tribute
to
the
great
man
s
proximity
that
made
the
boy
interesting
and
i
began
to
watch
archie
always
enthusiastic
but
vague
had
said
oh
he
s
a
tremendous
chap
you
ll
see
but
i
hadn
t
expected
to
see
quite
so
clearly
lanfear
s
vision
of
course
was
sharper
than
mine
and
the
next
morning
he
had
carried
dredge
off
to
the
biological
station
and
that
was
the
way
it
began
dredge
is
the
son
of
a
baptist
minister
he
comes
from
east
lethe
new
york
state
and
was
working
his
way
through
college
waiting
at
white
mountain
hotels
in
summer
when
archie
lanfear
ran
across
him
there
were
eight
children
in
the
family
and
the
mother
was
an
invalid
dredge
never
had
a
penny
from
his
father
after
he
was
fourteen
but
his
mother
wanted
him
to
be
a
scholar
and
kept
at
him
as
he
put
it
in
the
hope
of
his
going
back
to
teach
school
at
east
lethe
he
developed
slowly
as
the
scientific
mind
generally
does
and
was
still
adrift
about
himself
and
his
tendencies
when
archie
took
him
down
to
buzzard
s
bay
but
he
had
read
lanfear
s
utility
and
variation
and
had
always
been
a
patient
and
curious
observer
of
nature
and
his
first
meeting
with
lanfear
explained
him
to
himself
it
didn
t
however
enable
him
to
explain
himself
to
others
and
for
a
long
time
he
remained
to
all
but
lanfear
an
object
of
incredulity
and
conjecture
my
husband
wants
him
about
poor
lanfear
the
kindest
of
women
privately
lamented
to
her
friends
for
dredge
at
that
time
they
kept
him
all
summer
at
the
bungalow
had
one
of
the
most
encumbering
personalities
you
can
imagine
he
was
as
inexpressive
as
he
is
and
yet
oddly
obtrusive
one
of
those
uncomfortable
presences
whose
silence
is
an
interruption
the
poor
lanfears
almost
died
of
him
that
summer
and
the
pity
of
it
was
that
he
never
suspected
it
but
continued
to
lavish
on
them
a
floundering
devotion
as
uncomfortable
as
the
endearments
of
a
dripping
dog
all
out
of
gratitude
for
the
professor
s
kindness
he
was
full
in
those
days
of
raw
enthusiasms
which
he
forced
on
any
one
who
would
listen
when
his
first
shyness
had
worn
off
you
can
t
picture
him
spouting
sentimental
poetry
can
you
yet
i
ve
seen
him
petrify
a
whole
group
of
lanfear
s
callers
by
suddenly
discharging
on
them
in
the
strident
drawl
of
western
new
york
barbara
frietchie
or
the
queen
of
the
his
taste
in
literature
was
uniformly
bad
but
very
definite
and
far
more
assertive
than
his
views
on
biological
questions
in
his
scientific
judgments
he
showed
even
then
a
remarkable
temperance
a
precocious
openness
to
the
opposite
view
but
in
literature
he
was
a
furious
propagandist
aggressive
disputatious
and
extremely
sensitive
to
adverse
opinion
lanfear
of
course
had
been
struck
from
the
first
by
his
gift
of
accurate
observation
and
by
the
fact
that
his
eagerness
to
learn
was
offset
by
his
reluctance
to
conclude
i
remember
lanfear
s
telling
me
that
he
had
never
known
a
lad
of
dredge
s
age
who
gave
such
promise
of
uniting
an
aptitude
for
general
ideas
with
the
plodding
patience
of
the
accumulator
of
facts
of
course
when
lanfear
talked
like
that
of
a
young
biologist
his
fate
was
sealed
there
could
be
no
question
of
dredge
s
going
back
to
teach
school
at
east
lethe
he
must
take
a
course
in
biology
at
columbia
spend
his
vacations
at
the
wood
s
holl
laboratory
and
then
if
possible
go
to
germany
for
a
year
or
two
all
this
meant
his
virtual
adoption
by
the
lanfears
most
of
lanfear
s
fortune
went
in
helping
young
students
to
a
start
and
he
devoted
his
heaviest
subsidies
to
dredge
dredge
will
be
my
biggest
dividend
you
ll
see
he
used
to
say
in
the
chrysalis
days
when
poor
galen
was
known
to
the
world
of
science
only
as
a
perpetual
slouching
presence
in
lanfear
s
and
dredge
it
must
be
said
took
his
obligations
simply
with
that
kind
of
personal
dignity
and
quiet
sense
of
his
own
worth
which
in
such
cases
saves
the
beneficiary
from
abjectness
he
seemed
to
trust
himself
as
fully
as
lanfear
trusted
him
the
comic
part
of
it
was
that
his
only
idea
of
making
what
is
known
as
a
return
was
to
devote
himself
to
the
professor
s
family
when
i
hear
pretty
women
lamenting
that
they
can
t
coax
professor
dredge
out
of
his
laboratory
i
remember
mabel
lanfear
s
cry
to
me
if
galen
would
only
keep
away
when
mabel
fell
on
the
ice
and
broke
her
leg
galen
walked
seven
miles
in
a
blizzard
to
get
a
surgeon
but
if
he
did
her
this
service
one
day
in
the
year
he
bored
her
by
being
in
the
way
for
the
other
three
hundred
and
one
would
have
imagined
at
that
time
that
he
thought
his
perpetual
presence
the
greatest
gift
he
could
bestow
for
except
on
the
occasion
of
his
fetching
the
surgeon
i
don
t
remember
his
taking
any
other
way
of
expressing
his
gratitude
in
love
with
mabel
not
a
bit
but
the
queer
thing
was
that
he
have
a
passion
in
those
days
a
blind
hopeless
passion
for
lanfear
yes
i
know
what
i
m
saying
i
mean
lanfear
the
professor
s
wife
poor
lanfear
with
her
tight
hair
and
her
loose
figure
her
blameless
brow
and
earnest
and
her
perpetual
attitude
of
mild
misapprehension
i
can
see
dredge
cowering
long
and
in
a
diminutive
chair
one
shoe
coiled
round
an
exposed
ankle
his
knees
clasped
in
a
knot
of
red
knuckles
and
his
spectacles
perpetually
seeking
lanfear
s
i
never
knew
if
the
poor
lady
was
aware
of
the
sentiment
she
inspired
but
her
children
observed
it
and
it
provoked
them
to
irreverent
mirth
galen
was
the
predestined
butt
of
mabel
and
archie
and
secure
in
their
mother
s
virtuous
obtuseness
and
in
her
worshipper
s
timidity
they
allowed
themselves
a
latitude
of
banter
that
sometimes
turned
their
audience
cold
dredge
meanwhile
was
going
on
obstinately
with
his
work
now
and
then
he
had
queer
fits
of
idleness
when
he
lapsed
into
a
state
of
sulky
inertia
from
which
even
lanfear
s
admonitions
could
not
rouse
him
once
just
before
an
examination
he
suddenly
went
off
to
the
maine
woods
for
two
weeks
came
back
and
failed
to
pass
i
don
t
know
if
his
benefactor
ever
lost
hope
but
at
times
his
confidence
must
have
been
sorely
strained
the
queer
part
of
it
was
that
when
dredge
emerged
from
these
eclipses
he
seemed
keener
and
more
active
than
ever
his
slowly
growing
intelligence
probably
needed
its
periodical
pauses
of
assimilation
and
lanfear
was
marvellously
patient
at
last
dredge
finished
his
course
and
went
to
germany
and
when
he
came
back
he
was
a
new
man
was
in
fact
the
dredge
we
all
know
he
seemed
to
have
shed
his
blundering
encumbering
personality
and
come
to
life
as
a
disembodied
intelligence
his
fidelity
to
the
lanfears
was
unchanged
but
he
showed
it
negatively
by
his
discretions
and
abstentions
i
have
an
idea
that
mabel
was
less
disposed
to
deride
him
might
even
have
been
induced
to
softer
sentiments
but
i
doubt
if
dredge
even
noticed
the
change
as
for
his
he
seemed
to
regard
her
as
a
motherly
household
divinity
the
guardian
genius
of
the
darning
needle
but
on
professor
lanfear
he
looked
with
a
deepening
reverence
if
the
rest
of
the
family
had
diminished
in
his
eyes
its
head
had
grown
even
greater
ii
from
that
day
dredge
s
progress
continued
steadily
if
not
always
perceptible
to
the
untrained
eye
in
lanfear
s
sight
it
never
deviated
and
the
great
man
began
to
associate
dredge
with
his
work
and
to
lean
on
him
more
and
more
lanfear
s
health
was
already
failing
and
in
my
confidential
talks
with
him
i
saw
how
he
counted
on
galen
dredge
to
continue
and
amplify
his
doctrine
if
he
did
not
describe
the
young
man
as
his
predestined
huxley
it
was
because
any
such
comparison
between
himself
and
his
great
predecessors
would
have
been
repugnant
to
his
taste
but
he
evidently
felt
that
it
would
be
dredge
s
role
to
reveal
him
to
posterity
and
the
young
man
seemed
at
that
time
to
take
the
same
view
of
his
calling
when
he
was
not
busy
about
lanfear
s
work
he
was
recording
their
conversations
with
the
diligence
of
a
biographer
and
the
accuracy
of
a
naturalist
any
attempt
to
question
or
minimize
lanfear
s
theories
roused
in
his
disciple
the
only
flashes
of
wrath
i
have
ever
seen
a
scientific
discussion
provoke
in
him
in
defending
his
master
he
became
almost
as
intemperate
as
in
the
early
period
of
his
literary
passions
such
filial
dedication
must
have
been
all
the
more
precious
to
lanfear
because
about
that
time
it
became
evident
that
archie
would
never
carry
on
his
father
s
work
he
had
begun
brilliantly
you
may
remember
by
a
little
paper
on
that
attracted
a
good
deal
of
notice
when
it
appeared
in
the
but
gradually
his
zoological
ardour
yielded
to
an
absorbing
passion
for
the
violin
which
was
followed
by
a
sudden
plunge
into
physics
at
present
after
a
at
the
drama
i
understand
he
s
devoting
what
is
left
of
his
father
s
money
to
archaeological
explorations
in
asia
minor
archie
s
got
a
delightful
little
mind
lanfear
used
to
say
to
me
rather
wistfully
but
it
s
just
a
highly
polished
surface
held
up
to
the
show
as
it
passes
dredge
s
mind
takes
in
only
a
bit
at
a
time
but
the
bit
stays
and
other
bits
are
joined
to
it
in
a
hard
mosaic
of
fact
of
which
imagination
weaves
the
pattern
i
saw
just
how
it
would
be
years
ago
when
my
boy
used
to
take
my
meaning
in
a
flash
and
answer
me
with
clever
objections
while
galen
disappeared
into
one
of
his
fathomless
silences
and
then
came
to
the
surface
like
a
dripping
retriever
a
long
way
beyond
archie
s
objections
and
with
an
answer
to
them
in
his
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
crowning
satisfaction
of
lanfear
s
career
came
to
him
i
mean
of
course
john
weyman
s
gift
to
columbia
of
the
lanfear
laboratory
and
the
founding
in
connection
with
it
of
a
chair
of
experimental
evolution
weyman
had
always
taken
an
interest
in
lanfear
s
work
but
no
one
had
supposed
that
his
interest
would
express
itself
so
magnificently
the
honour
came
to
lanfear
at
a
time
when
he
was
fighting
an
accumulation
of
troubles
failing
health
the
money
difficulties
resulting
from
his
irrepressible
generosity
his
disappointment
about
archie
s
career
and
perhaps
also
the
persistent
attacks
of
the
new
school
of
german
zoologists
if
i
hadn
t
galen
i
should
feel
the
game
was
up
he
said
to
me
once
in
a
fit
of
despondency
but
he
ll
do
what
i
haven
t
time
to
do
myself
and
what
my
boy
can
t
do
for
that
meant
that
he
would
answer
the
critics
and
triumphantly
affirm
lanfear
s
theory
which
had
been
rudely
shaken
but
not
displaced
a
scientific
hypothesis
lasts
till
there
s
something
else
to
put
in
its
place
people
who
want
to
get
across
a
river
will
use
the
old
bridge
till
the
new
one
s
built
and
i
don
t
see
any
one
who
s
particularly
anxious
in
this
case
to
take
a
contract
for
the
new
one
lanfear
ended
and
i
remember
answering
with
a
laugh
not
while
horatius
dredge
holds
the
it
was
generally
known
that
lanfear
had
not
long
to
live
and
the
laboratory
was
hardly
opened
before
the
question
of
his
successor
in
the
chair
of
experimental
evolution
began
to
be
a
matter
of
public
discussion
it
was
conceded
that
whoever
followed
him
ought
to
be
a
man
of
achieved
reputation
some
one
carrying
as
the
french
say
a
considerable
at
the
same
time
even
lanfear
s
critics
felt
that
he
should
be
succeeded
by
a
man
who
held
his
views
and
would
continue
his
teaching
this
was
not
in
itself
a
difficulty
for
german
criticism
had
so
far
been
mainly
negative
and
there
were
plenty
of
good
men
who
while
they
questioned
the
permanent
validity
of
lanfear
s
conclusions
were
yet
ready
to
accept
them
for
their
provisional
usefulness
and
then
there
was
the
added
inducement
of
the
laboratory
the
columbia
professor
of
experimental
evolution
has
at
his
disposal
the
most
complete
instrument
of
biological
research
that
modern
ingenuity
has
yet
produced
and
it
s
not
only
in
theology
or
politics
paris
vaut
bien
une
messe
there
was
no
trouble
about
finding
a
candidate
but
the
whole
thing
turned
on
lanfear
s
decision
since
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
by
weyman
s
wish
he
was
to
select
his
successor
and
what
a
cry
there
was
when
he
selected
galen
dredge
not
in
the
scientific
world
though
the
specialists
were
beginning
to
know
about
dredge
his
remarkable
paper
on
sexual
dimorphism
had
been
translated
into
several
languages
and
a
furious
polemic
had
broken
out
over
it
when
a
young
fellow
can
get
the
big
men
fighting
over
him
his
future
is
pretty
well
assured
but
dredge
was
only
and
some
people
seemed
to
feel
that
there
was
a
kind
of
deflected
nepotism
in
lanfear
s
choice
if
he
could
choose
dredge
he
might
as
well
have
chosen
his
own
son
i
ve
heard
it
said
and
the
irony
was
that
archie
will
you
believe
it
actually
thought
so
himself
but
lanfear
had
weyman
behind
him
and
when
the
end
came
the
faculty
at
once
appointed
galen
dredge
to
the
chair
of
experimental
evolution
for
the
first
two
years
things
went
quietly
along
accustomed
lines
dredge
simply
continued
the
course
which
lanfear
s
death
had
interrupted
he
lectured
well
even
then
with
a
persuasive
simplicity
surprising
in
the
slow
inarticulate
creature
one
knew
him
for
but
haven
t
you
noticed
that
certain
personalities
reveal
themselves
only
in
the
more
impersonal
relations
of
life
it
s
as
if
they
woke
only
to
collective
contacts
and
the
single
consciousness
were
an
unmeaning
fragment
to
them
if
there
was
anything
to
criticize
in
that
first
part
of
the
course
it
was
the
avoidance
of
general
ideas
of
those
brilliant
rockets
of
conjecture
that
lanfear
s
students
were
used
to
seeing
him
fling
across
the
darkness
i
remember
once
saying
this
to
archie
who
having
recovered
from
his
absurd
disappointment
had
returned
to
his
old
allegiance
to
dredge
oh
that
s
galen
all
over
he
doesn
t
want
to
jump
into
the
ring
till
he
has
a
big
swishing
argument
in
his
fist
he
ll
wait
twenty
years
if
he
has
to
that
s
his
strength
he
s
never
afraid
to
i
thought
this
shrewd
of
archie
as
well
as
generous
and
i
saw
the
wisdom
of
dredge
s
course
as
lanfear
himself
had
said
his
theory
was
safe
enough
till
somebody
found
a
more
attractive
one
and
before
that
day
dredge
would
probably
have
accumulated
sufficient
proof
to
crystallize
the
fluid
hypothesis
iii
the
third
winter
i
was
off
collecting
in
central
america
and
didn
t
get
back
till
dredge
s
course
had
been
going
for
a
couple
of
months
the
very
day
i
turned
up
in
town
archie
lanfear
descended
on
me
with
a
summons
from
his
mother
i
was
wanted
at
once
at
a
family
council
i
found
the
lanfear
ladies
in
a
state
of
incoherent
distress
which
archie
s
own
indignation
hardly
made
more
intelligible
but
gradually
i
put
together
their
fragmentary
charges
and
learned
that
dredge
s
lectures
were
turning
into
an
organized
assault
on
his
master
s
doctrine
it
amounts
to
just
this
archie
said
controlling
his
women
with
the
masterful
gesture
of
the
weak
man
galen
has
simply
turned
round
and
betrayed
my
just
for
a
handful
of
silver
he
left
us
mabel
sobbed
in
parenthesis
while
lanfear
tearfully
cited
hamlet
archie
silenced
them
again
the
ugly
part
of
it
is
that
he
must
have
had
this
up
his
sleeve
for
years
he
must
have
known
when
he
was
asked
to
succeed
my
father
what
use
he
meant
to
make
of
his
opportunity
what
he
s
doing
isn
t
the
result
of
a
hasty
conclusion
it
means
years
of
work
and
archie
broke
off
to
explain
himself
he
had
returned
from
europe
the
week
before
and
had
learned
on
arriving
that
dredge
s
lectures
were
stirring
the
world
of
science
as
nothing
had
stirred
it
since
lanfear
s
utility
and
and
the
incredible
outrage
was
that
they
owed
their
sensational
effect
to
the
fact
of
being
an
attempted
refutation
of
lanfear
s
great
work
i
own
that
i
was
staggered
the
case
looked
ugly
as
archie
said
and
there
was
a
veil
of
reticence
of
secrecy
about
dredge
that
always
kept
his
conduct
in
a
of
uncertainty
of
some
men
one
would
have
said
it
s
impossible
but
one
couldn
t
affirm
it
of
him
archie
hadn
t
seen
him
as
yet
and
lanfear
had
sent
for
me
because
she
wished
me
to
be
present
at
the
interview
between
the
two
men
the
lanfear
ladies
had
a
touching
belief
in
archie
s
violence
they
thought
him
as
terrible
as
a
natural
force
my
own
idea
was
that
if
there
were
any
broken
bones
they
wouldn
t
be
dredge
s
but
i
was
too
curious
as
to
the
outcome
not
to
be
glad
to
offer
my
services
as
moderator
first
however
i
wanted
to
hear
one
of
the
lectures
and
i
went
the
next
afternoon
the
hall
was
jammed
and
i
saw
as
soon
as
dredge
appeared
what
increased
security
and
ease
the
interest
of
his
public
had
given
him
he
had
been
clear
the
year
before
now
he
was
also
eloquent
the
lecture
was
a
remarkable
effort
you
ll
find
the
gist
of
it
in
chapter
vii
of
the
arrival
of
the
archie
sat
at
my
side
in
a
white
rage
he
was
too
clever
not
to
measure
the
extent
of
the
disaster
and
i
was
almost
as
indignant
as
he
when
we
went
to
see
dredge
the
next
day
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
latter
suspected
nothing
and
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
began
by
questioning
me
about
my
finds
and
only
afterward
turned
to
reproach
archie
for
having
been
back
a
week
without
notifying
him
you
know
i
m
up
to
my
neck
in
this
job
why
in
the
world
didn
t
you
hunt
me
up
before
this
the
question
was
exasperating
and
i
could
understand
archie
s
stammer
of
wrath
hunt
you
up
hunt
you
up
what
the
deuce
are
you
made
of
to
ask
me
such
a
question
instead
of
wondering
why
i
m
here
now
dredge
bent
his
slow
calm
scrutiny
on
his
friend
s
quivering
face
then
he
turned
to
me
what
s
the
matter
he
said
simply
the
matter
shrieked
archie
his
clenched
fist
hovering
excitedly
above
the
desk
by
which
he
stood
but
dredge
with
unwonted
quickness
caught
the
fist
as
it
descended
careful
i
ve
got
a
in
that
jar
he
pushed
a
chair
forward
and
added
quietly
sit
archie
ignoring
the
gesture
towered
pale
and
avenging
in
his
place
and
dredge
after
a
moment
took
the
chair
himself
the
matter
archie
reiterated
with
rising
passion
are
you
so
lost
to
all
sense
of
decency
and
honour
that
you
can
put
that
question
in
good
faith
don
t
you
really
what
s
the
matter
dredge
smiled
slowly
there
are
so
few
things
one
oh
damn
your
scientific
don
t
you
know
you
re
insulting
my
father
s
memory
dredge
stared
again
turning
his
spectacles
thoughtfully
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
oh
that
s
it
is
it
then
you
d
better
sit
down
if
you
don
t
see
at
once
it
ll
take
some
time
to
make
archie
burst
into
an
ironic
laugh
i
rather
think
it
will
he
conceded
sit
down
archie
i
said
setting
the
example
and
he
obeyed
with
a
gesture
that
made
his
consent
a
protest
dredge
seemed
to
notice
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
his
visitors
were
seated
he
reached
for
his
pipe
and
filled
it
with
the
care
which
the
habit
of
delicate
manipulations
gave
to
all
the
motions
of
his
long
knotty
hands
it
s
about
the
lectures
he
said
archie
s
answer
was
a
deep
scornful
breath
you
ve
only
been
back
a
week
so
you
ve
only
heard
one
i
suppose
it
was
not
necessary
to
hear
even
that
one
you
must
know
the
talk
they
re
making
if
notoriety
is
what
you
re
after
well
i
m
not
sorry
to
make
a
noise
said
dredge
putting
a
match
to
his
pipe
archie
bounded
in
his
chair
there
s
no
easier
way
of
doing
it
than
to
attack
a
man
who
can
t
answer
you
dredge
raised
a
sobering
hand
hold
on
perhaps
you
and
i
don
t
mean
the
same
thing
tell
me
first
what
s
in
your
the
request
steadied
archie
who
turned
on
dredge
a
countenance
really
eloquent
with
filial
indignation
it
s
an
odd
question
for
you
to
ask
it
makes
me
wonder
what
s
in
yours
not
much
thought
of
my
father
at
any
rate
or
you
couldn
t
stand
in
his
place
and
use
the
chance
he
s
given
you
to
push
yourself
at
his
dredge
received
this
in
silence
puffing
slowly
at
his
pipe
is
that
the
way
it
strikes
you
he
asked
at
length
god
it
s
the
way
it
would
strike
most
he
turned
to
me
you
too
i
can
see
how
archie
feels
i
said
that
i
m
attacking
his
father
s
memory
to
glorify
myself
well
not
precisely
i
think
what
he
really
feels
is
that
if
your
convictions
didn
t
permit
you
to
continue
his
father
s
teaching
you
might
perhaps
have
done
better
to
sever
your
connection
with
the
lanfear
then
you
and
he
regard
the
lanfear
lectureship
as
having
been
founded
to
perpetuate
a
dogma
not
to
try
and
get
at
the
truth
certainly
not
archie
broke
in
but
there
s
a
question
of
taste
of
delicacy
involved
in
the
case
that
can
t
be
decided
on
abstract
principles
we
know
as
well
as
you
that
my
father
meant
the
laboratory
and
the
lectureship
to
serve
the
ends
of
science
at
whatever
cost
to
his
own
special
convictions
what
we
feel
and
you
don
t
seem
to
is
that
you
re
the
last
man
to
put
them
to
that
use
and
i
don
t
want
to
remind
you
a
slight
redness
rose
through
dredge
s
sallow
skin
you
needn
t
he
said
it
s
because
he
pulled
me
out
of
my
hole
woke
me
up
made
me
shoved
me
off
from
the
shore
because
he
saved
me
ten
or
twenty
years
of
muddled
effort
and
put
me
where
i
am
at
an
age
when
my
best
working
years
are
still
ahead
of
me
every
one
knows
that
s
what
your
father
did
for
me
but
i
m
the
only
person
who
knows
the
time
and
trouble
that
it
it
was
well
said
and
i
glanced
quickly
at
archie
who
was
never
closed
to
generous
emotions
well
then
he
said
flushing
also
well
then
dredge
continued
his
voice
deepening
and
losing
its
nasal
edge
i
had
to
pay
him
back
didn
t
i
the
sudden
drop
flung
archie
back
on
his
prepared
attitude
of
irony
it
would
be
the
natural
inference
with
most
just
so
and
i
m
not
so
very
different
i
knew
your
father
wanted
a
successor
some
one
who
d
try
and
tie
up
the
loose
ends
and
i
took
the
lectureship
with
that
and
you
re
using
it
to
tear
the
whole
fabric
to
pieces
dredge
paused
to
his
pipe
looks
that
way
he
conceded
this
year
this
archie
gasped
at
him
yes
when
i
took
up
the
job
i
saw
it
just
as
your
father
left
it
or
rather
i
didn
t
see
any
other
way
of
going
on
with
it
the
change
came
gradually
as
i
gradually
so
that
you
had
time
to
look
round
you
to
know
where
you
were
to
see
you
were
fatally
committed
to
undoing
the
work
he
had
done
oh
yes
i
had
time
dredge
conceded
and
yet
you
kept
the
chair
and
went
on
with
the
course
dredge
refilled
his
pipe
and
then
turned
in
his
seat
so
that
he
looked
squarely
at
archie
what
would
your
father
have
done
in
my
place
he
asked
in
your
place
yes
supposing
he
d
found
out
the
things
i
ve
found
out
in
the
last
year
or
two
you
ll
see
what
they
are
and
how
much
they
count
if
you
ll
run
over
the
report
of
the
lectures
if
your
father
d
been
alive
he
might
have
come
across
the
same
facts
just
as
there
was
a
silence
which
archie
at
last
broke
by
saying
but
he
didn
t
and
you
did
there
s
the
the
difference
what
difference
would
your
father
have
suppressed
the
facts
if
he
d
found
them
it
s
who
insult
his
memory
by
implying
it
and
if
i
d
brought
them
to
him
would
he
have
used
his
hold
over
me
to
get
me
to
suppress
them
certainly
not
but
can
t
you
see
it
s
his
death
that
makes
the
difference
he
s
not
here
to
defend
his
dredge
laughed
but
not
unkindly
my
dear
archie
your
father
wasn
t
one
of
the
kind
who
bother
to
defend
their
case
men
like
him
are
the
masters
not
the
servants
of
their
theories
they
respect
an
idea
only
as
long
as
it
s
of
use
to
them
when
it
s
usefulness
ends
they
chuck
it
out
and
that
s
what
your
father
would
have
archie
reddened
don
t
you
assume
a
good
deal
in
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
would
have
had
to
in
this
particular
case
dredge
reflected
yes
i
was
going
too
far
each
of
us
can
only
answer
for
himself
but
to
my
mind
your
father
s
theory
is
and
you
don
t
hesitate
to
be
the
man
to
do
it
should
i
have
been
of
any
use
if
i
had
and
did
your
father
ever
ask
anything
of
me
but
to
be
of
as
much
use
as
i
could
it
was
archie
s
turn
to
reflect
no
that
was
what
he
always
wanted
of
that
s
the
way
i
ve
always
felt
the
first
day
he
took
me
away
from
east
lethe
i
knew
the
debt
i
was
piling
up
against
him
and
i
never
had
any
doubt
as
to
how
i
d
pay
it
or
how
he
d
want
it
paid
he
didn
t
pick
me
out
and
train
me
for
any
object
but
to
carry
on
the
light
do
you
suppose
he
d
have
wanted
me
to
snuff
it
out
because
it
happened
to
light
up
a
fact
he
didn
t
fancy
i
m
using
oil
to
feed
my
torch
with
yes
but
it
isn
t
really
his
torch
or
mine
or
his
oil
or
mine
they
belong
to
each
of
us
till
we
drop
and
hand
them
archie
turned
a
sobered
glance
on
him
i
see
your
point
but
if
the
job
had
to
be
done
i
don
t
see
that
you
need
have
done
it
from
his
there
s
where
we
differ
if
i
did
it
at
all
i
had
to
do
it
in
the
best
way
and
with
all
the
authority
his
backing
gave
me
if
i
owe
your
father
anything
i
owe
him
that
it
would
have
made
him
sick
to
see
the
job
badly
done
and
don
t
you
see
that
the
way
to
honour
him
and
show
what
he
s
done
for
science
was
to
spare
no
advantage
in
my
attack
on
him
that
i
m
proving
the
strength
of
his
position
by
the
desperateness
of
my
assault
dredge
paused
and
squared
his
lounging
shoulders
after
all
he
added
he
s
not
down
yet
and
if
i
leave
him
standing
i
guess
it
ll
be
some
time
before
anybody
else
cares
to
tackle
there
was
a
silence
between
the
two
men
then
dredge
continued
in
a
lighter
tone
there
s
one
thing
though
that
we
re
both
in
danger
of
forgetting
and
that
is
how
little
in
the
long
run
it
all
counts
either
he
smiled
a
little
at
archie
s
outraged
gesture
the
most
we
can
any
of
us
do
even
by
such
a
magnificent
effort
as
your
father
s
is
to
turn
the
great
marching
army
a
hair
s
breadth
nearer
what
seems
to
us
the
right
direction
if
one
of
us
drops
out
here
and
there
the
loss
of
headway
s
hardly
perceptible
and
that
s
what
i
m
coming
to
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
walked
across
to
the
hearth
then
cautiously
resting
his
against
the
jammed
with
miscellaneous
specimens
he
bent
his
musing
spectacles
on
archie
your
father
would
have
understood
why
i
ve
done
what
i
m
doing
but
that
s
no
reason
why
the
rest
of
you
should
and
i
rather
think
it
s
the
rest
of
you
who
ve
suffered
most
from
me
he
always
knew
what
i
was
and
that
must
have
been
some
comfort
even
when
i
was
most
in
the
way
but
i
was
just
an
ordinary
nuisance
to
you
and
your
mother
and
mabel
you
were
all
too
kind
to
let
me
see
it
at
the
time
but
i
ve
seen
it
since
and
it
makes
me
feel
that
after
all
the
settling
of
this
matter
lies
with
you
if
it
hurts
you
to
have
me
go
on
with
my
examination
of
your
father
s
theory
i
m
ready
to
drop
the
lectures
and
trust
to
the
lanfear
laboratory
to
breed
up
a
young
chap
who
ll
knock
us
both
out
in
time
you
ve
only
got
to
say
the
there
was
a
pause
while
dredge
turned
and
laid
his
extinguished
pipe
carefully
between
a
jar
of
embryo
and
a
colony
of
regenerating
planarians
then
archie
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
no
he
said
simply
go
full
circle
i
geoffrey
betton
woke
rather
late
so
late
that
the
winter
sunlight
sliding
across
his
warm
red
carpet
struck
his
eyes
as
he
turned
on
the
pillow
strett
the
valet
had
been
in
drawn
the
bath
in
the
adjoining
placed
the
crystal
and
silver
at
his
side
put
a
match
to
the
fire
and
thrown
open
the
windows
to
the
bright
morning
air
it
brought
in
on
the
glitter
of
sun
all
the
shrill
crisp
morning
noises
those
piercing
notes
of
the
american
thoroughfare
that
seem
to
take
a
sharper
vibration
from
the
clearness
of
the
medium
through
which
they
pass
betton
raised
himself
languidly
that
was
the
voice
of
fifth
avenue
below
his
windows
he
remembered
that
when
he
moved
into
his
rooms
eighteen
months
before
the
sound
had
been
like
music
to
him
the
complex
orchestration
to
which
the
tune
of
his
new
life
was
set
now
it
filled
him
with
horror
and
weariness
since
it
had
become
the
symbol
of
the
hurry
and
noise
of
that
new
life
he
had
been
far
less
hurried
in
the
old
days
when
he
had
to
be
up
by
seven
and
down
at
the
office
sharp
at
nine
now
that
he
got
up
when
he
chose
and
his
life
had
no
fixed
framework
of
duties
the
hours
hunted
him
like
a
pack
of
he
dropped
back
on
his
pillows
with
a
groan
yes
not
a
year
ago
there
had
been
a
positively
sensuous
joy
in
getting
out
of
bed
feeling
under
his
bare
feet
the
softness
of
the
sunlit
carpet
and
entering
the
shining
tiled
sanctuary
where
his
great
porcelain
bath
proffered
its
renovating
flood
but
then
a
year
ago
he
could
still
call
up
the
horror
of
the
communal
plunge
at
his
earlier
lodgings
the
listening
for
other
bathers
the
dodging
of
shrouded
ladies
in
crimping
the
cold
wait
on
the
landing
the
reluctant
descent
into
a
blotchy
tin
bath
and
the
effort
to
identify
one
s
soap
and
among
the
promiscuous
implements
of
ablution
that
memory
had
faded
now
and
betton
saw
only
the
dark
hours
to
which
his
blue
and
white
temple
of
refreshment
formed
a
kind
of
glittering
antechamber
for
after
his
bath
came
his
breakfast
and
on
the
his
letters
his
letters
he
remembered
and
memory
had
not
faded
the
thrill
with
which
he
had
opened
the
first
missive
in
a
strange
feminine
hand
the
letter
beginning
i
wonder
if
you
ll
mind
an
unknown
reader
s
telling
you
all
that
your
book
has
been
to
her
mind
ye
gods
he
minded
now
for
more
than
a
year
after
the
publication
of
diadems
and
faggots
the
letters
the
inane
indiscriminate
letters
of
condemnation
of
criticism
of
interrogation
had
poured
in
on
him
by
every
post
hundreds
of
unknown
readers
had
told
him
with
unsparing
detail
all
that
his
book
had
been
to
them
and
the
wonder
of
it
was
when
all
was
said
and
done
that
it
had
really
been
so
little
that
when
their
thick
broth
of
praise
was
strained
through
the
author
s
anxious
vanity
there
remained
to
him
so
small
a
sediment
of
definite
specific
understanding
no
it
was
always
the
same
thing
over
and
over
and
over
again
the
same
vague
gush
of
adjectives
the
same
incorrigible
tendency
to
estimate
his
effort
according
to
each
writer
s
personal
preferences
instead
of
regarding
it
as
a
work
of
art
a
thing
to
be
measured
by
objective
standards
he
smiled
to
think
how
little
at
first
he
had
felt
the
vanity
of
it
all
he
had
found
a
savour
even
in
the
grosser
evidences
of
popularity
the
advertisements
of
his
book
the
daily
shower
of
clippings
the
sense
that
when
he
entered
a
restaurant
or
a
theatre
people
nudged
each
other
and
said
that
s
yes
the
publicity
had
been
sweet
to
him
at
first
he
had
been
touched
by
the
sympathy
of
his
had
thought
indulgently
of
the
world
as
a
better
place
than
the
failures
and
the
dyspeptics
would
acknowledge
and
then
his
success
began
to
submerge
him
he
gasped
under
the
thickening
shower
of
letters
his
admirers
were
really
unappeasable
and
they
wanted
him
to
do
such
preposterous
things
to
give
lectures
to
head
movements
to
be
tendered
receptions
to
speak
at
banquets
to
address
mothers
to
plead
for
orphans
to
go
up
in
balloons
to
lead
the
struggle
for
sterilized
milk
they
wanted
his
photograph
for
literary
supplements
his
autograph
for
charity
bazaars
his
name
on
committees
literary
educational
and
social
above
all
they
wanted
his
opinion
on
everything
on
christianity
buddhism
tight
lacing
the
democratic
government
female
suffrage
and
love
perhaps
the
chief
benefit
of
this
demand
was
his
incidentally
learning
from
it
how
few
opinions
he
really
had
the
only
one
that
remained
with
him
was
a
rooted
horror
of
all
forms
of
correspondence
he
had
been
unutterably
thankful
when
the
letters
began
to
fall
off
diadems
and
faggots
was
now
two
years
old
and
the
moment
was
at
hand
when
its
author
might
have
counted
on
regaining
the
blessed
shelter
of
oblivion
if
only
he
had
not
written
another
book
for
it
was
the
worst
part
of
his
plight
that
his
first
success
had
goaded
him
to
the
perpetration
of
this
particular
folly
that
one
of
the
incentives
hideous
thought
to
his
new
work
had
been
the
desire
to
extend
and
perpetuate
his
popularity
and
this
very
week
the
book
was
to
come
out
and
the
letters
the
cursed
letters
would
begin
again
wistfully
almost
plaintively
he
contemplated
the
with
which
strett
presently
appeared
it
bore
only
two
notes
and
the
morning
journals
but
he
knew
that
within
the
week
it
would
groan
under
its
epistolary
burden
the
very
newspapers
flung
the
fact
at
him
as
he
opened
them
ready
on
monday
geoffrey
betton
s
new
novel
abundance
by
the
author
of
diadems
and
first
edition
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
already
sold
out
order
now
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
volumes
and
an
average
of
three
readers
to
each
half
a
million
of
people
would
be
reading
him
within
a
week
and
every
one
of
them
would
write
to
him
and
their
friends
and
relations
would
write
too
he
laid
down
the
paper
with
a
shudder
the
two
notes
looked
harmless
enough
and
the
calligraphy
of
one
was
vaguely
familiar
he
opened
the
envelope
and
looked
at
the
signature
he
had
not
seen
the
name
in
years
what
on
earth
could
duncan
vyse
have
to
say
he
ran
over
the
page
and
dropped
it
with
a
wondering
exclamation
which
the
watchful
strett
met
by
a
tentative
yes
sir
nothing
yes
that
is
betton
picked
up
the
note
there
s
a
gentleman
a
vyse
coming
to
see
me
at
strett
glanced
at
the
clock
yes
sir
you
ll
remember
that
ten
was
the
hour
you
appointed
for
the
secretaries
to
call
betton
nodded
i
ll
see
vyse
first
my
clothes
as
he
got
into
them
in
the
state
of
irritable
hurry
that
had
become
almost
chronic
with
him
he
continued
to
think
about
duncan
vyse
they
had
seen
a
lot
of
each
other
for
the
few
years
after
both
had
left
harvard
the
hard
happy
years
when
betton
had
been
grinding
at
his
business
and
vyse
poor
devil
trying
to
write
the
novelist
recalled
his
friend
s
attempts
with
a
smile
then
the
memory
of
one
small
volume
came
back
to
him
it
was
a
novel
the
lifted
there
was
stuff
in
that
certainly
he
remembered
vyse
s
tossing
it
down
on
his
table
with
a
gesture
of
despair
when
it
came
back
from
the
last
publisher
betton
taking
it
up
indifferently
had
sat
riveted
till
daylight
when
he
ended
the
impression
was
so
strong
that
he
said
to
himself
i
ll
tell
apthorn
about
it
i
ll
go
and
see
him
his
own
secret
literary
yearnings
gave
him
a
passionate
desire
to
champion
vyse
to
see
him
triumph
over
the
ignorance
and
timidity
of
the
publishers
apthorn
was
the
youngest
of
the
guild
still
capable
of
opinions
and
the
courage
of
them
a
personal
friend
of
betton
s
and
as
it
happened
the
man
afterward
to
become
known
as
the
privileged
publisher
of
diadems
and
unluckily
the
next
day
something
unexpected
turned
up
and
betton
forgot
about
vyse
and
his
manuscript
he
continued
to
forget
for
a
month
and
then
came
a
note
from
vyse
who
was
ill
and
wrote
to
ask
what
his
friend
had
done
betton
did
not
like
to
say
i
ve
done
nothing
so
he
left
the
note
unanswered
and
vowed
again
i
ll
see
the
following
day
he
was
called
to
the
west
on
business
and
was
gone
a
month
when
he
came
back
there
was
another
note
from
vyse
who
was
still
ill
and
desperately
hard
up
i
ll
take
anything
for
the
book
if
they
ll
advance
me
two
hundred
betton
full
of
compunction
would
gladly
have
advanced
the
sum
himself
but
he
was
hard
up
too
and
could
only
swear
inwardly
i
ll
write
to
then
he
glanced
again
at
the
manuscript
and
reflected
no
there
are
things
in
it
that
need
explaining
i
d
better
see
once
he
went
so
far
as
to
telephone
apthorn
but
the
publisher
was
out
then
he
finally
and
completely
forgot
one
sunday
he
went
out
of
town
and
on
his
return
rummaging
among
the
papers
on
his
desk
he
missed
the
lifted
lamp
which
had
been
gathering
dust
there
for
half
a
year
what
the
deuce
could
have
become
of
it
betton
spent
a
feverish
hour
in
vainly
increasing
the
disorder
of
his
documents
and
then
bethought
himself
of
calling
the
who
first
indignantly
denied
having
touched
anything
i
can
see
that
s
true
from
the
dust
betton
scathingly
interjected
and
then
mentioned
with
hauteur
that
a
young
lady
had
called
in
his
absence
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
get
a
book
a
lady
did
you
let
her
come
up
she
said
somebody
d
sent
vyse
of
course
vyse
had
sent
her
for
his
manuscript
he
was
always
mixed
up
with
some
woman
and
it
was
just
like
him
to
send
the
girl
of
the
moment
to
betton
s
lodgings
with
instructions
to
force
the
door
in
his
absence
vyse
had
never
been
remarkable
for
delicacy
betton
furious
glanced
over
his
table
to
see
if
any
of
his
own
effects
were
missing
one
couldn
t
tell
with
the
company
vyse
kept
and
then
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
with
a
vague
sense
of
magnanimity
in
doing
so
he
felt
himself
exonerated
by
vyse
s
conduct
the
sense
of
magnanimity
was
still
uppermost
when
the
valet
opened
the
door
to
announce
mr
vyse
and
betton
a
moment
later
crossed
the
threshold
of
his
pleasant
library
his
first
thought
was
that
the
man
facing
him
from
the
was
the
very
duncan
vyse
of
old
small
starved
with
the
same
sidelong
movements
the
same
queer
air
of
anaemic
truculence
only
he
had
grown
shabbier
and
bald
betton
held
out
a
hospitable
hand
this
is
a
good
surprise
glad
you
looked
me
up
my
dear
vyse
s
palm
was
damp
and
bony
he
had
always
had
a
disagreeable
hand
you
got
my
note
you
know
what
i
ve
come
for
he
said
about
the
secretaryship
sit
down
is
that
really
serious
betton
lowered
himself
luxuriously
into
one
of
his
vast
maple
he
had
grown
stouter
in
the
last
year
and
the
cushion
behind
him
fitted
comfortably
into
the
crease
of
his
nape
as
he
leaned
back
he
caught
sight
of
his
image
in
the
mirror
between
the
windows
and
reflected
uneasily
that
vyse
would
not
find
unchanged
serious
vyse
rejoined
why
not
aren
t
oh
betton
laughed
apologetically
only
well
the
fact
is
you
may
not
understand
what
rubbish
a
secretary
of
mine
would
have
to
deal
with
in
advertising
for
one
i
never
imagined
i
didn
t
aspire
to
any
one
above
the
ordinary
i
m
the
ordinary
hack
said
vyse
drily
betton
s
affable
gesture
protested
my
dear
fellow
you
see
it
s
not
business
what
i
m
in
now
he
continued
with
a
laugh
vyse
s
thin
lips
seemed
to
form
a
noiseless
isn
it
which
they
instantly
transposed
into
the
audibly
reply
i
inferred
from
your
advertisement
that
you
want
some
one
to
relieve
you
in
your
literary
work
dictation
that
kind
of
thing
well
no
not
that
either
i
type
my
own
things
what
i
m
looking
for
is
somebody
who
won
t
be
above
tackling
my
vyse
looked
slightly
surprised
i
should
be
glad
of
the
job
he
then
said
betton
began
to
feel
a
vague
embarrassment
he
had
supposed
that
such
a
proposal
would
be
instantly
rejected
it
would
be
only
for
an
hour
or
two
a
day
if
you
re
doing
any
writing
of
your
own
he
threw
out
interrogatively
no
i
ve
given
all
that
up
i
m
in
an
office
now
business
but
it
doesn
t
take
all
my
time
or
pay
enough
to
keep
me
in
that
case
my
dear
fellow
if
you
could
come
every
morning
but
it
s
mostly
awful
bosh
you
know
betton
again
broke
off
with
growing
awkwardness
vyse
glanced
at
him
humorously
what
you
want
me
to
write
well
that
depends
betton
sketched
the
obligatory
smile
but
i
was
thinking
of
the
letters
you
ll
have
to
answer
letters
about
my
books
you
know
i
ve
another
one
appearing
next
week
and
i
want
to
be
beforehand
now
dam
the
flood
before
it
swamps
me
have
you
any
idea
of
the
deluge
of
stuff
that
people
write
to
a
successful
novelist
as
betton
spoke
he
saw
a
tinge
of
red
on
vyse
s
thin
cheek
and
his
own
reflected
it
in
a
richer
glow
of
shame
i
mean
i
mean
he
stammered
helplessly
no
i
haven
t
said
vyse
but
it
will
be
awfully
jolly
finding
there
was
a
pause
groping
and
desperate
on
betton
s
part
sardonically
calm
on
his
visitor
s
you
you
ve
given
up
writing
altogether
betton
continued
yes
we
ve
changed
places
as
it
vyse
paused
but
about
these
letters
you
dictate
the
answers
lord
no
that
s
the
reason
why
i
said
i
wanted
somebody
er
well
used
to
writing
i
don
t
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
not
a
thing
you
ll
have
to
answer
them
as
if
they
were
written
to
betton
pulled
himself
up
again
and
rising
in
confusion
jerked
open
one
of
the
drawers
of
his
here
this
kind
of
rubbish
he
said
tossing
a
packet
of
letters
onto
vyse
s
knee
oh
you
keep
them
do
you
said
vyse
simply
i
well
some
of
them
a
few
of
the
funniest
vyse
slipped
off
the
band
and
began
to
open
the
letters
while
he
was
glancing
over
them
betton
again
caught
his
own
reflection
in
the
glass
and
asked
himself
what
impression
he
had
made
on
his
visitor
it
occurred
to
him
for
the
first
time
that
his
person
presented
the
image
of
commercial
rather
than
of
intellectual
achievement
he
did
not
look
like
his
own
idea
of
the
author
of
diadems
and
faggots
and
he
wondered
why
vyse
laid
the
letters
aside
i
think
i
can
do
it
if
you
ll
give
me
a
notion
of
the
tone
i
m
to
the
tone
yes
that
is
if
i
m
to
sign
your
oh
of
course
i
expect
you
to
sign
for
me
as
for
the
tone
say
just
what
you
d
well
say
all
you
can
without
encouraging
them
to
vyse
rose
from
his
seat
i
could
submit
a
few
specimens
he
suggested
oh
as
to
that
you
always
wrote
better
than
i
do
said
betton
handsomely
i
ve
never
had
this
kind
of
thing
to
write
when
do
you
wish
me
to
begin
vyse
enquired
ignoring
the
tribute
the
book
s
out
on
monday
the
deluge
will
begin
about
three
days
after
will
you
turn
up
on
thursday
at
this
hour
betton
held
his
hand
out
with
real
heartiness
it
was
great
luck
for
me
your
striking
that
advertisement
don
t
be
too
harsh
with
my
correspondents
i
owe
them
something
for
having
brought
us
ii
the
deluge
began
punctually
on
the
thursday
and
vyse
arriving
as
punctually
had
an
impressive
pile
of
letters
to
attack
betton
on
his
way
to
the
park
for
a
ride
came
into
the
library
smoking
the
cigarette
of
indolence
to
look
over
his
secretary
s
shoulder
how
many
of
em
twenty
good
lord
it
s
going
to
be
worse
than
i
ve
just
had
my
first
quiet
breakfast
in
two
years
time
to
read
the
papers
and
loaf
how
i
used
to
dread
the
sight
of
my
now
i
sha
n
t
know
i
have
he
leaned
over
vyse
s
chair
and
the
secretary
handed
him
a
letter
here
s
rather
an
exceptional
one
lady
evidently
i
thought
you
might
want
to
answer
it
yourself
exceptional
betton
ran
over
the
mauve
pages
and
tossed
them
down
why
my
dear
man
i
get
hundreds
like
that
you
ll
have
to
be
pretty
short
with
her
or
she
ll
send
her
he
clapped
vyse
on
the
shoulder
and
turned
away
humming
a
tune
stay
to
luncheon
he
called
back
gaily
from
the
threshold
after
luncheon
vyse
insisted
on
showing
a
few
of
his
answers
to
the
first
batch
of
letters
if
i
ve
struck
the
note
i
won
t
bother
you
again
he
urged
and
betton
groaningly
consented
my
dear
fellow
they
re
beautiful
too
beautiful
i
ll
be
let
in
for
a
correspondence
with
every
one
of
these
vyse
at
this
meditated
for
a
while
above
a
blank
sheet
all
right
how
s
this
he
said
after
another
interval
of
rapid
writing
betton
glanced
over
the
page
by
george
by
george
won
t
she
it
he
exulted
between
fear
and
rapture
it
s
wonderful
how
little
people
see
said
vyse
reassuringly
the
letters
continued
to
pour
in
for
several
weeks
after
the
appearance
of
for
five
or
six
blissful
days
betton
did
not
even
have
his
mail
brought
to
him
trusting
to
vyse
to
single
out
his
personal
correspondence
and
to
deal
with
the
rest
according
to
their
agreement
during
those
days
he
luxuriated
in
a
sense
of
wild
and
lawless
freedom
then
gradually
he
began
to
feel
the
need
of
fresh
restraints
to
break
and
learned
that
the
zest
of
liberty
lies
in
the
escape
from
specific
obligations
at
first
he
was
conscious
only
of
a
vague
hunger
but
in
time
the
craving
resolved
into
a
desire
to
see
his
letters
after
all
i
hated
them
only
because
i
had
to
answer
them
and
he
told
vyse
carelessly
that
he
wished
all
his
letters
submitted
to
him
before
the
secretary
answered
them
at
first
he
pushed
aside
those
beginning
i
have
just
laid
down
abundance
after
a
third
reading
or
every
day
for
the
last
month
i
have
been
telephoning
my
bookseller
to
know
when
your
novel
would
be
but
little
by
little
the
freshness
of
his
interest
revived
and
even
this
stereotyped
homage
began
to
arrest
his
eye
at
last
a
day
came
when
he
read
all
the
letters
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
as
he
had
done
when
diadems
and
faggots
appeared
it
was
really
a
pleasure
to
read
them
now
that
he
was
relieved
of
the
burden
of
replying
his
new
relation
to
his
correspondents
had
the
glow
of
a
unchilled
by
the
contingency
of
marriage
one
day
it
struck
him
that
the
letters
were
coming
in
more
slowly
and
in
smaller
numbers
certainly
there
had
been
more
of
a
rush
when
diadems
and
faggots
came
out
betton
began
to
wonder
if
vyse
were
exercising
an
unauthorized
discrimination
and
keeping
back
the
communications
he
deemed
least
important
this
sudden
conjecture
carried
the
novelist
straight
to
his
library
where
he
found
vyse
bending
over
the
with
his
usual
inscrutable
pale
smile
but
once
there
betton
hardly
knew
how
to
frame
his
question
and
blundered
into
an
enquiry
for
a
missing
invitation
there
s
a
note
a
personal
note
i
ought
to
have
had
this
morning
sure
you
haven
t
kept
it
back
by
mistake
among
the
others
vyse
laid
down
his
pen
the
others
but
i
never
keep
back
betton
had
foreseen
the
answer
not
even
the
worst
twaddle
about
my
book
he
suggested
lightly
pushing
the
papers
about
nothing
i
understood
you
wanted
to
go
over
them
all
well
perhaps
it
s
safer
betton
conceded
as
if
the
idea
were
new
to
him
with
an
embarrassed
hand
he
continued
to
turn
over
the
letters
at
vyse
s
elbow
those
are
yesterday
s
said
the
secretary
here
are
s
he
added
pointing
to
a
meagre
trio
h
m
only
these
betton
took
them
and
looked
them
over
lingeringly
i
don
t
see
what
the
deuce
that
chap
means
about
the
first
part
of
abundance
certainly
justifying
the
title
do
you
vyse
was
silent
and
the
novelist
continued
irritably
damned
cheek
his
writing
if
he
doesn
t
like
the
book
who
cares
what
he
thinks
about
it
anyhow
and
his
morning
ride
was
embittered
by
the
discovery
that
it
was
unexpectedly
disagreeable
to
have
vyse
read
any
letters
which
did
not
express
unqualified
praise
of
his
books
he
began
to
fancy
there
was
a
latent
rancour
a
kind
of
baffled
sneer
under
vyse
s
manner
and
he
decided
to
return
to
the
practice
of
having
his
mail
brought
straight
to
his
room
in
that
way
he
could
edit
the
letters
before
his
secretary
saw
them
vyse
made
no
comment
on
the
change
and
betton
was
reduced
to
wondering
whether
his
imperturbable
composure
were
the
mask
of
complete
indifference
or
of
a
watchful
jealousy
the
latter
view
being
more
agreeable
to
his
employer
s
the
next
step
was
to
conclude
that
vyse
had
not
forgotten
the
episode
of
the
lifted
lamp
and
would
naturally
take
a
vindictive
joy
in
any
unfavourable
judgments
passed
on
his
rival
s
work
this
did
not
simplify
the
situation
for
there
was
no
denying
that
unfavourable
criticisms
preponderated
in
betton
s
correspondence
abundance
was
neither
meeting
with
the
unrestricted
welcome
of
diadems
and
faggots
nor
enjoying
the
alternative
of
an
animated
controversy
it
was
simply
found
dull
and
its
readers
said
so
in
language
not
too
tactfully
tempered
by
regretful
comparisons
with
its
predecessor
to
withhold
unfavourable
comments
from
vyse
was
therefore
to
make
it
appear
that
correspondence
about
the
book
had
died
out
and
its
author
mindful
of
his
unguarded
predictions
found
this
even
more
embarrassing
the
simplest
solution
would
be
to
get
rid
of
vyse
and
to
this
end
betton
began
to
address
his
energies
one
evening
finding
himself
unexpectedly
disengaged
he
asked
vyse
to
dine
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
in
the
course
of
an
chat
he
might
delicately
hint
his
feeling
that
the
work
he
had
offered
his
friend
was
unworthy
so
accomplished
a
hand
vyse
surprised
him
by
a
momentary
hesitation
i
may
not
have
time
to
betton
stared
what
s
the
odds
we
ll
dine
here
and
as
late
as
you
vyse
thanked
him
and
appeared
punctually
at
eight
in
all
the
shabbiness
of
his
daily
wear
he
looked
paler
and
more
shyly
truculent
than
usual
and
betton
from
the
height
of
his
florid
stature
said
to
himself
with
the
sudden
professional
instinct
for
type
he
might
be
an
agent
of
something
a
chap
who
carries
deadly
vyse
it
was
to
appear
did
carry
a
deadly
secret
but
one
less
perilous
to
society
than
to
himself
he
was
simply
poor
inexcusably
irremediably
poor
everything
failed
him
had
always
failed
him
whatever
he
put
his
hand
to
went
to
bits
this
was
the
confession
that
reluctantly
yet
with
a
kind
of
bravado
he
flung
at
betton
in
answer
to
the
latter
s
tentative
suggestion
that
really
the
job
wasn
t
worth
bothering
him
with
a
thing
that
any
could
do
if
you
mean
you
re
paying
me
more
than
it
s
worth
i
ll
take
less
vyse
rushed
out
after
a
pause
oh
my
dear
fellow
betton
protested
flushing
what
you
mean
then
don
t
i
answer
the
letters
as
you
want
them
answered
betton
anxiously
stroked
his
silken
ankle
you
do
it
beautifully
too
beautifully
i
mean
what
i
say
the
work
s
not
worthy
of
you
i
m
ashamed
to
ask
you
oh
hang
shame
vyse
interrupted
do
you
know
why
i
said
i
shouldn
t
have
time
to
dress
because
i
haven
t
any
evening
clothes
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
haven
t
much
but
the
clothes
i
stand
in
one
thing
after
another
s
gone
against
me
all
the
infernal
ingenuities
of
chance
it
s
been
a
slow
chinese
torture
the
kind
where
they
keep
you
alive
to
have
more
fun
killing
he
straightened
himself
with
a
sudden
blush
oh
i
m
all
right
now
getting
on
capitally
but
i
m
still
walking
rather
a
narrow
plank
and
if
i
do
your
work
well
enough
if
i
take
your
idea
betton
stared
into
the
fire
without
answering
he
knew
next
to
nothing
of
vyse
s
history
of
the
mischance
or
that
had
brought
him
with
his
brains
and
his
training
to
so
unlikely
a
pass
but
a
pang
of
compunction
shot
through
him
as
he
remembered
the
manuscript
of
the
lifted
lamp
gathering
dust
on
his
table
for
half
a
year
not
that
it
would
have
made
any
earthly
difference
since
he
s
evidently
never
been
able
to
get
the
thing
but
this
reflection
did
not
wholly
console
betton
and
he
found
it
impossible
at
the
moment
to
tell
vyse
that
his
services
were
not
needed
iii
during
the
ensuing
weeks
the
letters
grew
fewer
and
fewer
and
betton
foresaw
the
approach
of
the
fatal
day
when
his
secretary
in
common
decency
would
have
to
say
i
can
t
draw
my
pay
for
doing
what
a
triumph
for
vyse
the
thought
was
intolerable
and
betton
cursed
his
weakness
in
not
having
dismissed
the
fellow
before
such
a
possibility
arose
if
i
tell
him
i
ve
no
use
for
him
now
he
ll
see
straight
through
it
of
course
and
then
hang
it
he
looks
so
poor
this
consideration
came
after
the
other
but
betton
in
rearranging
them
put
it
first
because
he
thought
it
looked
better
there
and
also
because
he
immediately
perceived
its
value
in
justifying
a
plan
of
action
that
was
beginning
to
take
shape
in
his
mind
poor
devil
i
m
damned
if
i
don
t
do
it
for
him
said
betton
sitting
down
at
his
desk
three
or
four
days
later
he
sent
word
to
vyse
that
he
didn
t
care
to
go
over
the
letters
any
longer
and
that
they
would
once
more
be
carried
directly
to
the
library
the
next
time
he
lounged
in
on
his
way
to
his
morning
ride
he
found
his
secretary
s
pen
in
active
motion
a
lot
vyse
told
him
cheerfully
his
tone
irritated
betton
it
had
the
inane
optimism
of
the
physician
reassuring
a
discouraged
patient
oh
lord
i
thought
it
was
almost
over
groaned
the
novelist
no
they
ve
just
got
their
second
wind
here
s
one
from
a
chicago
publisher
never
heard
the
name
offering
you
thirty
per
cent
on
your
next
novel
with
an
advance
royalty
of
twenty
thousand
and
here
s
a
chap
who
wants
to
syndicate
it
for
a
bunch
of
sunday
papers
big
offer
too
that
s
from
ann
arbor
and
this
oh
one
s
funny
he
held
up
a
small
scented
sheet
to
betton
who
made
no
movement
to
receive
it
funny
why
s
it
funny
he
growled
well
it
s
from
a
girl
a
lady
and
she
thinks
she
s
the
only
person
who
understands
abundance
has
the
clue
to
it
says
she
s
never
seen
a
book
so
misrepresented
by
the
critics
ha
ha
that
good
betton
agreed
with
too
loud
a
laugh
this
one
s
from
a
lady
too
married
woman
says
she
s
misunderstood
and
would
like
to
oh
lord
said
what
are
you
looking
at
he
added
sharply
as
vyse
continued
to
bend
his
blinking
gaze
on
the
letters
i
was
only
thinking
i
d
never
seen
such
short
letters
from
women
neither
one
fills
the
first
well
what
of
that
queried
betton
vyse
reflected
i
d
like
to
meet
a
woman
like
that
he
said
wearily
and
betton
laughed
again
the
letters
continued
to
pour
in
and
there
could
be
no
farther
question
of
dispensing
with
vyse
s
services
but
one
morning
about
three
weeks
later
the
latter
asked
for
a
word
with
his
employer
and
betton
on
entering
the
library
found
his
secretary
with
half
a
dozen
documents
spread
out
before
him
what
s
up
queried
betton
with
a
touch
of
impatience
vyse
was
attentively
scanning
the
outspread
letters
i
don
t
know
can
t
make
his
voice
had
a
faint
note
of
embarrassment
do
you
remember
a
note
signed
that
came
three
or
four
weeks
ago
married
misunderstood
western
army
post
wanted
to
correspond
betton
seemed
to
grope
among
his
memories
then
he
assented
vaguely
a
short
note
vyse
went
on
the
whole
story
in
half
a
page
the
shortness
struck
me
so
much
and
the
directness
that
i
wrote
her
wrote
in
my
own
name
i
in
your
own
name
betton
stood
amazed
then
he
broke
into
a
groan
good
lord
vyse
you
re
incorrigible
the
secretary
pulled
his
thin
moustache
with
a
nervous
laugh
if
you
mean
i
m
an
ass
you
re
right
look
he
held
out
an
envelope
stamped
with
the
words
dead
letter
my
effusion
has
come
back
to
me
marked
there
s
no
such
person
at
the
address
she
gave
betton
seemed
for
an
instant
to
share
his
secretary
s
embarrassment
then
he
burst
into
an
uproarious
laugh
hoax
was
it
that
s
rough
on
you
old
fellow
vyse
shrugged
his
shoulders
yes
but
the
interesting
question
is
why
on
earth
didn
t
answer
come
back
too
my
answer
the
official
one
the
one
i
wrote
in
your
name
if
she
s
unknown
what
s
become
of
betton
stared
at
him
with
eyes
wrinkled
by
amusement
perhaps
she
hadn
t
disappeared
vyse
disregarded
the
conjecture
look
here
i
believe
these
letters
are
a
hoax
he
broke
out
betton
stared
at
him
with
a
face
that
turned
slowly
red
and
angry
what
are
you
talking
about
all
what
letters
these
i
ve
spread
out
here
i
ve
been
comparing
them
and
i
believe
they
re
all
written
by
one
burton
s
redness
turned
to
a
purple
that
made
his
ruddy
moustache
seem
pale
what
the
devil
are
you
driving
at
he
asked
well
just
look
at
it
vyse
persisted
still
bent
above
the
letters
i
ve
been
studying
them
carefully
those
that
have
come
within
the
last
two
or
three
weeks
and
there
s
a
queer
likeness
in
the
writing
of
some
of
them
the
s
are
all
like
corkscrews
and
the
same
phrases
keep
recurring
the
ann
arbor
uses
the
same
expressions
as
the
president
of
the
girls
college
at
euphorbia
betton
laughed
aren
t
the
critics
always
groaning
over
the
shrinkage
of
the
national
vocabulary
of
course
we
all
use
the
same
yes
said
vyse
obstinately
but
how
about
using
the
same
s
betton
laughed
again
but
vyse
continued
without
heeding
him
look
here
betton
could
strett
have
written
them
strett
betton
roared
strett
he
threw
himself
into
his
to
shake
out
his
mirth
at
greater
ease
i
ll
tell
you
why
strett
always
posts
all
my
answers
he
comes
in
for
them
every
day
before
i
leave
he
posted
the
letter
to
the
misunderstood
party
the
letter
from
that
the
dead
letter
office
didn
t
return
posted
my
own
letter
to
her
and
that
came
a
measurable
silence
followed
the
emission
of
this
ingenious
conjecture
then
betton
observed
with
gentle
irony
extremely
neat
and
of
course
it
s
no
business
of
yours
to
supply
any
valid
motive
for
this
remarkable
attention
on
my
valet
s
vyse
cast
on
him
a
slanting
glance
if
you
ve
found
that
human
conduct
s
generally
based
on
valid
motives
well
outside
of
it
s
supposed
to
be
not
quite
vyse
had
an
odd
smile
under
his
thin
moustache
every
house
is
a
at
some
time
or
betton
rose
with
a
careless
shake
of
the
shoulders
this
one
will
be
if
i
talk
to
you
much
longer
he
said
moving
away
with
a
laugh
iv
betton
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
vyse
suspected
the
valet
of
having
written
the
letters
why
the
devil
don
t
he
say
out
what
he
thinks
he
was
always
a
tortuous
chap
he
grumbled
inwardly
the
sense
of
being
held
under
the
lens
of
vyse
s
mute
scrutiny
became
more
and
more
exasperating
betton
by
this
time
had
squared
his
shoulders
to
the
fact
that
abundance
was
a
failure
with
the
public
a
confessed
and
glaring
failure
the
press
told
him
so
openly
and
his
friends
emphasized
the
fact
by
their
circumlocutions
and
evasions
betton
minded
it
a
good
deal
more
than
he
had
expected
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
he
minded
vyse
s
knowing
it
that
remained
the
central
twinge
in
his
diffused
discomfort
and
the
problem
of
getting
rid
of
his
secretary
once
more
engaged
him
he
had
set
aside
all
sentimental
pretexts
for
retaining
vyse
but
a
practical
argument
replaced
them
if
i
ship
him
now
he
ll
think
it
s
because
i
m
ashamed
to
have
him
see
that
i
m
not
getting
any
more
for
the
letters
had
ceased
again
almost
abruptly
since
vyse
had
hazarded
the
conjecture
that
they
were
the
product
of
strett
s
devoted
pen
betton
had
reverted
only
once
to
the
subject
to
ask
ironically
a
day
or
two
later
is
strett
writing
to
me
as
much
as
ever
and
on
vyse
s
replying
with
a
neutral
had
added
with
a
laugh
if
you
suspect
you
might
as
well
think
i
write
the
letters
myself
there
are
very
few
said
vyse
with
his
irritating
evasiveness
and
betton
rejoined
squarely
oh
they
ll
stop
soon
the
book
s
a
a
few
mornings
later
he
felt
a
rush
of
shame
at
his
own
tergiversations
and
stalked
into
the
library
with
vyse
s
sentence
on
his
tongue
vyse
started
back
with
one
of
his
anaemic
blushes
i
was
hoping
you
d
be
in
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
there
ve
been
no
letters
the
last
day
or
two
he
explained
betton
drew
a
quick
breath
of
relief
the
man
had
some
sense
of
decency
then
he
meant
to
dismiss
himself
i
told
you
so
my
dear
fellow
the
book
s
a
flat
failure
he
said
almost
gaily
vyse
made
a
deprecating
gesture
i
don
t
know
that
i
should
regard
the
absence
of
letters
as
the
ultimate
test
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
if
there
isn
t
something
else
i
can
do
on
the
days
when
there
s
no
he
turned
his
glance
toward
the
walls
don
t
you
want
your
library
catalogued
he
asked
insidiously
had
it
done
last
year
betton
glanced
away
from
vyse
s
face
it
was
piteous
how
he
needed
the
job
i
see
of
course
this
is
just
a
temporary
lull
in
the
letters
they
ll
begin
again
as
they
did
before
the
people
who
read
carefully
read
slowly
you
haven
t
heard
yet
what
betton
felt
a
rush
of
puerile
joy
at
the
suggestion
actually
he
hadn
t
thought
of
that
there
a
big
second
crop
after
diadems
and
faggots
he
mused
aloud
of
course
wait
and
see
said
vyse
confidently
the
letters
in
fact
began
again
more
gradually
and
in
smaller
numbers
but
their
quality
was
different
as
vyse
had
predicted
and
in
two
cases
betton
s
correspondents
not
content
to
compress
into
one
rapid
communication
the
thoughts
inspired
by
his
work
developed
their
views
in
a
succession
of
really
remarkable
letters
one
of
the
writers
was
a
professor
in
a
western
college
the
other
was
a
girl
in
florida
in
their
language
their
point
of
view
their
reasons
for
appreciating
abundance
they
differed
almost
diametrically
but
this
only
made
the
unanimity
of
their
approval
the
more
striking
the
rush
of
correspondence
evoked
by
betton
s
earlier
novel
had
produced
nothing
so
personal
so
exceptional
as
these
communications
he
had
gulped
the
praise
of
diadems
and
faggots
as
undiscriminatingly
as
it
was
offered
now
he
knew
for
the
first
time
the
subtler
pleasures
of
the
palate
he
tried
to
feign
indifference
even
to
himself
and
to
vyse
he
made
no
sign
but
gradually
he
felt
a
desire
to
know
what
his
secretary
thought
of
the
letters
and
above
all
what
he
was
saying
in
reply
to
them
and
he
resented
acutely
the
possibility
of
vyse
s
starting
one
of
his
clandestine
correspondences
with
the
girl
in
florida
vyse
s
notorious
lack
of
delicacy
had
never
been
more
vividly
present
to
betton
s
imagination
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
answer
the
letters
himself
he
would
keep
vyse
on
of
course
there
were
other
communications
that
the
secretary
could
attend
to
and
if
necessary
betton
would
invent
an
occupation
he
cursed
his
stupidity
in
having
betrayed
the
fact
that
his
books
were
already
catalogued
vyse
showed
no
surprise
when
betton
announced
his
intention
of
dealing
personally
with
the
two
correspondents
who
showed
so
flattering
a
reluctance
to
take
their
leave
but
betton
immediately
read
a
criticism
in
his
lack
of
comment
and
put
forth
on
a
note
of
challenge
after
all
one
must
be
decent
vyse
looked
at
him
with
an
evanescent
smile
you
ll
have
to
explain
that
you
didn
t
write
the
first
betton
halted
well
i
i
more
or
less
dictated
them
didn
t
i
oh
virtually
they
re
yours
of
you
think
i
can
put
it
that
way
why
not
the
secretary
absently
drew
an
arabesque
on
the
of
course
they
ll
keep
it
up
longer
if
you
write
yourself
he
suggested
betton
blushed
but
faced
the
issue
hang
it
all
i
sha
n
t
be
sorry
they
interest
me
they
re
remarkable
and
vyse
without
observation
returned
to
his
writings
the
spring
that
year
was
delicious
to
betton
his
college
professor
continued
to
address
him
tersely
but
cogently
at
fixed
intervals
and
twice
a
week
eight
serried
pages
came
from
florida
there
were
other
letters
too
he
had
the
solace
of
feeling
that
at
last
abundance
was
making
its
way
was
reaching
the
people
who
as
vyse
said
read
slowly
because
they
read
intelligently
but
welcome
as
were
all
these
proofs
of
his
restored
authority
they
were
but
the
background
of
his
happiness
his
life
revolved
for
the
moment
about
the
personality
of
his
two
chief
correspondents
the
professor
s
letters
satisfied
his
craving
for
intellectual
recognition
and
the
satisfaction
he
felt
in
them
proved
how
completely
he
had
lost
faith
in
himself
he
blushed
to
think
that
his
opinion
of
his
work
had
been
swayed
by
the
shallow
judgments
of
a
public
whose
taste
he
despised
was
it
possible
that
he
had
allowed
himself
to
think
less
well
of
abundance
because
it
was
not
to
the
taste
of
the
average
such
false
humility
was
less
excusable
than
the
crudest
appetite
for
praise
it
was
ridiculous
to
try
to
do
conscientious
work
if
one
s
were
at
the
mercy
of
popular
judgments
all
this
the
professor
s
letters
delicately
and
indirectly
conveyed
to
betton
with
the
result
that
the
author
of
abundance
began
to
recognize
in
it
the
ripest
flower
of
his
genius
but
if
the
professor
understood
his
book
the
girl
in
florida
understood
and
betton
was
fully
alive
to
the
superior
qualities
of
discernment
which
this
process
implied
for
his
lovely
correspondent
his
novel
was
but
the
the
pretext
of
her
discourse
he
himself
was
her
real
object
and
he
had
the
delicious
sense
as
their
exchange
of
thoughts
proceeded
that
she
was
interested
in
abundance
because
of
its
author
rather
than
in
the
author
because
of
his
book
of
course
she
laid
stress
on
the
fact
that
his
ideas
were
the
object
of
her
contemplation
but
betton
s
agreeable
person
had
permitted
him
some
insight
into
the
incorrigible
subjectiveness
of
female
judgments
and
he
was
pleasantly
aware
from
the
lady
s
tone
that
she
guessed
him
to
be
neither
old
nor
ridiculous
and
suddenly
he
wrote
to
ask
if
he
might
see
her
the
answer
was
long
in
coming
betton
fumed
at
the
delay
watched
wondered
fretted
then
he
received
the
one
word
he
wrote
back
more
urgently
and
awaited
the
reply
with
increasing
eagerness
a
certain
shyness
had
kept
him
from
once
more
modifying
the
instructions
regarding
his
mail
and
strett
still
carried
the
letters
directly
to
vyse
the
hour
when
he
knew
they
were
passing
under
the
latter
s
eyes
was
now
becoming
intolerable
to
betton
and
it
was
a
profound
relief
when
the
secretary
suddenly
advised
of
his
father
s
illness
asked
permission
to
absent
himself
for
a
fortnight
vyse
departed
just
after
betton
had
despatched
to
florida
his
second
missive
of
entreaty
and
for
ten
days
he
tasted
the
furtive
joy
of
a
first
perusal
of
his
letters
the
answer
from
florida
was
not
among
them
but
betton
said
to
himself
she
s
thinking
it
over
and
delay
in
that
light
seemed
favourable
so
charming
in
fact
was
this
phase
of
sentimental
suspense
that
he
felt
a
start
of
resentment
when
a
telegram
apprised
him
one
morning
that
vyse
would
return
to
his
post
that
day
betton
had
slept
later
than
usual
and
springing
out
of
bed
with
the
telegram
in
his
hand
he
learned
from
the
clock
that
his
secretary
was
due
in
half
an
hour
he
reflected
that
the
morning
s
mail
must
long
since
be
in
and
too
impatient
to
wait
for
its
appearance
with
his
he
threw
on
a
and
went
to
the
library
there
lay
the
letters
half
a
dozen
of
them
but
his
eye
flew
to
one
envelope
and
as
he
tore
it
open
a
warm
wave
rocked
his
heart
the
letter
was
dated
a
few
days
after
its
writer
must
have
received
his
own
it
had
all
the
qualities
of
grace
and
insight
to
which
his
unknown
friend
had
accustomed
him
but
it
contained
no
allusion
however
indirect
to
the
special
purport
of
his
appeal
even
a
vanity
less
ingenious
than
betton
s
might
have
read
in
the
lady
s
silence
one
of
the
most
familiar
motions
of
consent
but
the
smile
provoked
by
this
inference
faded
as
he
turned
to
his
other
letters
for
the
uppermost
bore
the
superscription
dead
letter
office
and
the
document
that
fell
from
it
was
his
own
last
letter
from
florida
betton
studied
the
ironic
unknown
for
an
appreciable
space
of
time
then
he
broke
into
a
laugh
he
had
suddenly
recalled
vyse
s
similar
experience
with
hester
macklin
and
the
light
he
was
able
to
throw
on
that
obscure
episode
was
searching
enough
to
penetrate
all
the
dark
corners
of
his
own
adventure
he
felt
a
rush
of
heat
to
the
ears
catching
sight
of
himself
in
the
glass
he
saw
a
red
ridiculous
congested
countenance
and
dropped
into
a
chair
to
hide
it
between
flushed
fists
he
was
roused
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
vyse
appeared
on
the
threshold
oh
i
beg
pardon
you
re
ill
said
the
secretary
betton
s
only
answer
was
an
inarticulate
murmur
of
derision
then
he
pushed
forward
the
letter
with
the
imprint
of
the
dead
letter
office
look
at
that
he
jeered
vyse
peered
at
the
envelope
and
turned
it
over
slowly
in
his
hands
betton
s
eyes
fixed
on
him
saw
his
face
decompose
like
a
substance
touched
by
some
powerful
acid
he
clung
to
the
envelope
as
if
to
gain
time
it
s
from
the
young
lady
you
ve
been
writing
to
at
swazee
springs
he
asked
at
length
it
s
from
the
young
lady
i
ve
been
writing
to
at
swazee
well
i
suppose
she
s
gone
away
continued
vyse
rebuilding
his
countenance
rapidly
yes
and
in
a
community
numbering
perhaps
a
hundred
and
souls
including
the
dogs
and
chickens
the
local
is
so
ignorant
of
her
movements
that
my
letter
has
to
be
sent
to
the
dead
letter
vyse
meditated
on
this
then
he
laughed
in
turn
after
all
the
same
thing
happened
to
me
with
hester
macklin
i
mean
he
recalled
sheepishly
just
so
said
betton
bringing
down
his
clenched
fist
on
the
table
just
he
repeated
in
italics
he
caught
his
secretary
s
glance
and
held
it
with
his
own
for
a
moment
then
he
dropped
it
as
in
pity
one
releases
something
scared
and
squirming
the
very
day
my
letter
was
returned
from
swazee
springs
she
wrote
me
this
from
there
he
said
holding
up
the
last
florida
missive
ha
that
s
funny
said
vyse
with
a
damp
forehead
yes
it
s
funny
it
s
funny
said
betton
he
leaned
back
his
hands
in
his
pockets
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
and
noticing
a
crack
in
the
cornice
vyse
at
the
corner
of
the
waited
shall
i
get
to
work
he
began
after
a
silence
measurable
by
minutes
betton
s
gaze
descended
from
the
cornice
i
ve
got
your
seat
haven
t
i
he
said
rising
and
moving
away
from
the
table
vyse
with
a
quick
gleam
of
relief
slipped
into
the
vacant
chair
and
began
to
stir
about
vaguely
among
the
papers
how
s
your
father
betton
asked
from
the
hearth
oh
better
better
thank
you
he
ll
pull
out
of
but
you
had
a
sharp
scare
for
a
day
or
two
yes
it
was
touch
and
go
when
i
got
another
pause
while
vyse
began
to
classify
the
letters
and
i
suppose
betton
continued
in
a
steady
tone
your
anxiety
made
you
forget
your
usual
precautions
whatever
they
were
about
this
florida
correspondence
and
before
you
d
had
time
to
prevent
it
the
swazee
blundered
vyse
lifted
his
head
with
a
quick
movement
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
pushing
his
chair
back
i
mean
that
you
saw
i
couldn
t
live
without
flattery
and
that
you
ve
been
ladling
it
out
to
me
to
earn
your
vyse
sat
motionless
and
shrunken
digging
the
with
his
pen
what
on
earth
are
you
driving
at
he
repeated
though
why
the
deuce
betton
continued
in
the
same
steady
tone
you
should
need
to
do
this
kind
of
work
when
you
ve
got
such
faculties
at
your
service
those
letters
were
magnificent
my
dear
fellow
why
in
the
world
don
t
you
write
novels
instead
of
writing
to
other
people
about
them
vyse
straightened
himself
with
an
effort
what
are
you
talking
about
betton
why
the
devil
do
you
think
wrote
those
letters
betton
held
back
his
answer
with
a
brooding
face
because
i
wrote
hester
macklin
s
to
myself
vyse
sat
without
the
least
outcry
of
wonder
well
he
finally
said
in
a
low
tone
and
because
you
found
me
out
you
see
you
can
t
even
feign
surprise
because
you
saw
through
it
at
a
glance
knew
at
once
that
the
letters
were
faked
and
when
you
d
foolishly
put
me
on
my
guard
by
pointing
out
to
me
that
they
were
a
clumsy
forgery
and
had
then
suddenly
guessed
that
was
the
forger
you
drew
the
natural
inference
that
i
had
to
have
popular
approval
or
at
least
had
to
make
think
i
had
it
you
saw
that
to
me
the
worst
thing
about
the
failure
of
the
book
was
having
know
it
was
a
failure
and
so
you
applied
your
superior
your
immeasurably
superior
abilities
to
carrying
on
the
humbug
and
deceiving
me
as
i
d
tried
to
deceive
you
and
you
did
it
so
successfully
that
i
don
t
see
why
the
devil
you
haven
t
made
your
fortune
writing
novels
vyse
remained
silent
his
head
slightly
bent
under
the
mounting
tide
of
betton
s
denunciation
the
way
you
differentiated
your
people
characterised
them
avoided
my
stupid
mistake
of
making
the
women
s
letters
too
short
and
logical
of
letting
my
different
correspondents
use
the
same
expressions
the
amount
of
ingenuity
and
art
you
wasted
on
it
i
swear
vyse
i
m
sorry
that
damned
went
back
on
you
betton
went
on
piling
up
the
waves
of
his
irony
but
at
this
height
they
suddenly
paused
drew
back
on
themselves
and
began
to
recede
before
the
spectacle
of
vyse
s
pale
distress
something
warm
and
emotional
in
betton
s
nature
a
lurking
kindliness
perhaps
for
any
one
who
tried
to
soothe
and
smooth
his
writhing
ego
softened
his
eye
as
it
rested
on
the
drooping
figure
of
his
secretary
look
here
vyse
i
m
not
sorry
not
altogether
sorry
this
has
happened
he
moved
slowly
across
the
room
and
laid
a
friendly
palm
on
vyse
s
shoulder
in
a
queer
illogical
way
it
evens
up
things
as
it
were
i
did
you
a
shabby
turn
once
years
ago
oh
out
of
sheer
carelessness
of
course
about
that
novel
of
yours
i
promised
to
give
to
apthorn
if
i
given
it
it
might
not
have
made
any
difference
i
m
not
sure
it
wasn
t
too
good
for
success
but
anyhow
i
dare
say
you
thought
my
personal
influence
might
have
helped
you
might
at
least
have
got
you
a
quicker
hearing
perhaps
you
thought
it
was
because
the
thing
so
good
that
i
kept
it
back
that
i
felt
some
nasty
jealousy
of
your
superiority
i
swear
to
you
it
wasn
t
that
i
clean
forgot
it
and
one
day
when
i
came
home
it
was
gone
you
d
sent
and
taken
it
and
i
ve
always
thought
since
you
might
have
owed
me
a
grudge
and
not
unjustly
so
this
this
business
of
the
letters
the
sympathy
you
ve
shown
for
i
suppose
it
sympathy
vyse
startled
and
checked
him
by
a
queer
crackling
laugh
it
s
sympathy
broke
in
betton
the
moisture
drying
out
of
his
voice
he
withdrew
his
hand
from
vyse
s
shoulder
what
is
it
then
the
joy
of
uncovering
my
nakedness
an
eye
for
an
eye
is
it
vyse
rose
from
his
seat
and
with
a
mechanical
gesture
swept
into
a
heap
all
the
letters
he
had
sorted
i
m
stone
broke
and
wanted
to
keep
my
job
that
s
what
it
is
he
said
wearily
the
legend
i
arthur
bernald
could
never
afterward
recall
just
when
the
first
conjecture
flashed
on
him
oddly
enough
there
was
no
record
of
it
in
the
agitated
jottings
of
his
diary
but
as
it
seemed
to
him
in
retrospect
he
had
always
felt
that
the
queer
man
at
the
wades
must
be
john
pellerin
if
only
for
the
negative
reason
that
he
couldn
t
imaginably
be
any
one
else
it
was
impossible
in
the
confused
pattern
of
the
century
s
intellectual
life
to
fit
the
stranger
in
anywhere
save
in
the
big
gap
which
some
five
and
twenty
years
earlier
had
been
left
by
pellerin
s
unaccountable
disappearance
and
conversely
such
a
man
as
the
wades
visitor
couldn
t
have
lived
for
sixty
years
without
filling
somewhere
in
space
a
nearly
equivalent
void
at
all
events
it
was
certainly
not
to
doctor
wade
or
to
his
mother
that
bernald
owed
the
hint
the
good
unconscious
wades
one
of
whose
chief
charms
in
the
young
man
s
eyes
was
that
they
remained
so
robustly
untainted
by
pellerinism
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
doctor
wade
s
younger
brother
howland
was
among
its
most
impudently
flourishing
the
incident
had
begun
by
bernald
s
running
across
doctor
robert
wade
one
hot
summer
night
at
the
university
club
and
by
wade
s
saying
in
the
tone
of
unprofessional
laxity
which
the
shadowy
stillness
of
the
place
invited
i
got
hold
of
a
queer
fish
at
martin
s
the
other
day
case
of
picked
up
in
central
park
when
we
d
patched
him
up
i
found
he
had
nowhere
to
go
and
not
a
dollar
in
his
pocket
and
i
sent
him
down
to
our
place
at
portchester
to
the
opening
roused
his
hearer
s
attention
bob
wade
had
an
odd
unformulated
sense
of
values
that
bernald
had
learned
to
trust
what
sort
of
chap
young
or
old
oh
every
age
full
of
years
and
yet
with
a
lot
left
he
called
himself
sixty
on
the
sixty
s
a
good
age
for
some
kinds
of
living
and
age
is
of
course
purely
subjective
how
has
he
used
his
sixty
years
well
part
of
them
in
educating
himself
apparently
he
s
a
scholar
humanities
languages
and
so
oh
decayed
gentleman
bernald
murmured
disappointed
decayed
not
much
cried
the
doctor
with
his
accustomed
literalness
i
only
mentioned
that
side
of
winterman
his
name
s
winterman
because
it
was
the
side
my
mother
noticed
first
i
suppose
women
generally
do
but
it
s
only
a
part
a
small
part
the
man
s
the
big
really
big
well
there
again
when
i
took
him
down
to
the
country
looking
rather
like
a
tramp
from
a
shelter
with
an
untrimmed
beard
and
a
suit
of
he
d
slept
round
the
park
in
for
a
week
i
felt
sure
my
mother
d
carry
the
silver
up
to
her
room
and
send
for
the
gardener
s
dog
to
sleep
in
the
hall
the
first
night
but
she
didn
i
see
women
and
children
love
oh
wade
bernald
groaned
not
a
bit
of
it
you
re
out
again
we
don
t
love
him
either
of
us
but
we
him
the
air
s
charged
with
him
you
ll
and
bernald
agreed
that
he
see
the
following
sunday
wade
s
inarticulate
attempts
to
characterize
the
stranger
had
struck
his
friend
the
human
revelation
had
for
bernald
a
poignant
and
interest
which
his
trade
as
the
dramatic
critic
of
a
daily
paper
had
hitherto
failed
to
discourage
and
he
knew
that
bob
wade
simple
and
undefiled
by
literature
bernald
s
specific
affliction
had
a
free
and
personal
way
of
judging
men
and
the
diviner
s
knack
of
reaching
their
hidden
springs
during
the
days
that
followed
the
young
doctor
gave
bernald
farther
details
about
john
winterman
details
not
of
fact
for
in
that
respect
his
visitor
s
reticence
was
baffling
but
of
impression
it
appeared
that
winterman
while
lying
insensible
in
the
park
had
been
robbed
of
the
few
dollars
he
possessed
and
on
leaving
the
hospital
still
weak
and
he
had
quite
simply
and
unprotestingly
accepted
the
wades
offer
to
give
him
shelter
till
such
time
as
he
should
be
strong
enough
to
go
to
work
but
what
s
his
work
bernald
interjected
hasn
t
he
at
least
told
you
that
well
writing
some
kind
of
doctor
bob
always
became
vague
and
clumsy
when
he
approached
the
confines
of
literature
he
means
to
take
it
up
again
as
soon
as
his
eyes
get
bernald
groaned
oh
lord
that
finishes
him
and
he
s
looking
for
a
publisher
of
course
he
wants
a
favourable
i
won
t
come
he
hasn
t
written
a
line
for
twenty
a
line
of
what
kind
of
literature
can
one
keep
corked
up
for
twenty
years
wade
surprised
him
the
real
kind
i
should
say
but
i
don
t
know
winterman
s
line
the
doctor
added
he
speaks
of
the
things
he
used
to
write
merely
as
stuff
that
wouldn
t
he
has
a
wonderfully
confidential
way
of
telling
one
things
but
he
says
he
ll
have
to
do
something
for
his
living
as
soon
as
his
eyes
are
patched
up
and
that
writing
is
the
only
trade
he
knows
the
queer
thing
is
that
he
seems
pretty
sure
of
selling
he
even
talked
of
buying
the
bungalow
of
us
with
an
acre
or
two
about
the
bungalow
what
s
that
the
studio
down
by
the
shore
that
we
built
for
howland
when
he
thought
he
meant
to
howland
wade
as
bernald
knew
had
experienced
various
since
he
s
taken
to
writing
nobody
s
been
near
it
i
offered
it
to
winterman
and
he
camps
there
cooks
his
meals
does
his
own
and
never
comes
up
to
the
house
except
in
the
evenings
when
he
joins
us
on
the
verandah
in
the
dark
and
smokes
while
my
mother
a
discreet
visitor
eh
more
than
he
need
be
my
mother
actually
wanted
him
to
stay
on
in
the
house
in
her
pink
chintz
room
think
of
it
but
he
says
houses
smother
him
i
take
it
he
s
lived
for
years
in
the
in
the
open
where
i
can
t
make
out
except
that
it
was
somewhere
in
the
east
east
of
everything
beyond
the
in
places
not
on
the
that
s
the
way
he
put
it
and
when
i
said
you
ve
been
an
explorer
then
he
smiled
in
his
beard
and
answered
yes
that
s
it
an
yet
he
doesn
t
strike
me
as
a
man
of
action
hasn
t
the
hands
or
the
what
sort
of
hands
and
eyes
has
he
wade
reflected
his
range
of
observation
was
not
large
but
within
its
limits
it
was
exact
and
could
give
an
account
of
itself
he
s
worked
a
lot
with
his
hands
but
that
s
not
what
they
were
made
for
i
should
say
they
were
extraordinarily
delicate
conductors
of
sensation
and
his
eye
his
eye
too
he
hasn
t
used
it
to
dominate
people
he
didn
t
care
to
he
simply
looks
through
em
all
like
windows
makes
me
feel
like
the
fellows
who
think
they
re
made
of
glass
the
mitigating
circumstance
is
that
he
seems
to
see
such
a
glorious
landscape
through
wade
grinned
at
the
thought
of
serving
such
a
purpose
i
see
i
ll
come
on
sunday
and
be
looked
through
bernald
cried
ii
bernald
came
on
two
successive
sundays
and
the
second
time
he
lingered
till
the
tuesday
here
he
comes
wade
had
said
the
first
evening
as
the
two
young
men
with
wade
s
mother
sat
in
the
sultry
dusk
with
the
virginian
creeper
drawing
between
the
verandah
arches
its
black
arabesques
against
a
sky
in
the
darkness
bernald
heard
a
step
on
the
gravel
and
saw
the
red
flit
of
a
cigar
through
the
shrubs
then
a
figure
obscured
the
patch
of
sky
between
the
creepers
and
the
red
spark
became
the
centre
of
a
dim
bearded
face
in
which
bernald
discerned
only
a
broad
white
gleam
of
forehead
it
was
the
young
man
s
subsequent
impression
that
winterman
had
not
spoken
much
that
first
evening
at
any
rate
bernald
himself
remembered
chiefly
what
the
wades
had
said
and
this
was
the
more
curious
because
he
had
come
for
the
purpose
of
studying
their
visitor
and
because
there
was
nothing
to
divert
him
from
that
purpose
in
wade
s
halting
communications
or
his
mother
s
artless
comments
he
reflected
afterward
that
there
must
have
been
a
mysteriously
fertilizing
quality
in
the
stranger
s
silence
it
had
brooded
over
their
talk
like
a
large
moist
cloud
above
a
dry
country
wade
apparently
apprehensive
lest
her
son
should
have
given
bernald
an
exaggerated
notion
of
their
visitor
s
importance
had
hastened
to
qualify
it
before
the
latter
appeared
he
s
not
what
you
or
howland
would
call
intellectual
bernald
writhed
at
the
coupling
of
the
names
not
in
the
least
though
he
told
bob
he
used
to
write
i
don
t
think
though
it
could
have
been
what
howland
would
call
wade
always
mentioned
her
younger
son
with
a
reverential
drop
of
the
voice
she
viewed
literature
much
as
she
did
providence
as
an
inscrutably
mystery
and
she
spoke
of
howland
as
a
dedicated
being
set
apart
to
perform
secret
rites
within
the
veil
of
the
sanctuary
i
shouldn
t
say
he
had
a
quick
mind
she
continued
reverting
apologetically
to
winterman
sometimes
he
hardly
seems
to
follow
what
we
re
saying
but
he
s
got
such
sound
ideas
when
he
does
speak
he
s
never
silly
and
clever
people
sometimes
don
t
you
think
so
bernald
groaned
an
unqualified
assent
and
he
s
so
capable
the
other
day
something
went
wrong
with
the
kitchen
range
just
as
i
was
expecting
some
friends
of
bob
s
for
dinner
and
do
you
know
when
winterman
heard
we
were
in
trouble
he
came
and
took
a
look
and
knew
at
once
what
to
do
i
told
him
it
was
a
dreadful
pity
he
wasn
t
married
close
on
midnight
when
the
session
on
the
verandah
ended
and
the
two
young
men
were
strolling
down
to
the
bungalow
at
winterman
s
side
bernald
s
mind
reverted
to
the
image
of
the
fertilizing
cloud
there
was
something
brooding
pregnant
in
the
silent
presence
beside
him
he
had
in
place
of
any
circumscribing
impression
of
the
individual
a
large
hovering
sense
of
manifold
latent
meanings
and
he
felt
a
distinct
thrill
of
relief
when
down
the
lawn
doctor
bob
was
checked
by
a
voice
that
called
him
back
to
the
telephone
now
i
ll
be
with
him
alone
thought
bernald
with
a
throb
like
a
lover
s
in
the
bungalow
winterman
had
to
grope
for
the
lamp
on
his
desk
and
as
its
light
struck
up
into
his
face
bernald
s
sense
of
the
rareness
of
his
opportunity
increased
he
couldn
t
have
said
why
for
the
face
with
its
ridged
brows
its
shabby
greyish
beard
and
blunt
socratic
nose
made
no
direct
appeal
to
the
eye
it
seemed
rather
like
a
stage
on
which
remarkable
things
might
be
enacted
like
some
shaggy
moorland
landscape
dependent
for
form
and
expression
on
the
clouds
rolling
over
it
and
the
bursts
of
light
between
and
one
of
these
flashed
out
in
the
smile
with
which
winterman
as
if
in
answer
to
his
companion
s
thought
said
simply
as
he
turned
to
fill
his
pipe
now
we
ll
so
he
d
known
all
along
that
they
hadn
t
yet
and
had
guessed
that
with
bernald
one
might
the
young
man
s
glow
of
pleasure
was
so
intense
that
it
left
him
for
a
moment
unable
to
meet
the
challenge
and
in
that
moment
he
felt
the
brush
of
something
winged
and
summoning
his
spirit
rose
to
it
with
a
rush
but
just
as
he
felt
himself
poised
between
the
ascending
pinions
the
door
opened
and
bob
wade
plunged
in
too
bad
i
m
so
sorry
it
was
from
howland
to
say
he
can
t
come
after
the
doctor
panted
out
his
news
with
honest
grief
i
tried
my
best
to
pull
it
off
for
you
and
my
brother
to
come
he
s
keen
to
talk
to
you
and
see
what
he
can
do
but
you
see
he
s
so
tremendously
in
demand
he
ll
try
for
another
sunday
later
winterman
nodded
with
a
whimsical
gesture
oh
he
ll
find
me
here
i
shall
work
my
time
out
he
pointed
to
the
scattered
sheets
on
the
kitchen
table
which
formed
his
writing
desk
not
slowly
enough
to
suit
us
wade
answered
hospitably
only
if
howland
could
have
come
he
might
have
given
you
a
tip
or
two
put
you
on
the
right
track
shown
you
how
to
get
in
touch
with
the
winterman
his
hands
in
his
sagging
pockets
lounged
against
the
bare
pine
walls
twisting
his
pipe
under
his
beard
does
your
brother
enjoy
the
privilege
of
that
contact
he
questioned
gravely
wade
stared
a
little
oh
of
course
howland
s
not
what
you
d
call
a
writer
he
despises
that
kind
of
thing
but
whatever
he
says
goes
with
well
with
the
chaps
that
count
and
every
one
tells
me
he
s
written
book
on
pellerin
you
must
read
it
when
you
get
back
your
he
paused
as
if
to
let
the
name
sink
in
but
winterman
drew
at
his
pipe
with
a
blank
face
you
must
have
heard
of
pellerin
i
suppose
the
doctor
continued
i
ve
never
read
a
word
of
him
myself
he
s
too
big
a
proposition
for
but
one
can
t
escape
the
talk
about
him
i
have
him
crammed
down
my
throat
even
in
hospital
the
internes
read
him
at
the
clinics
he
tumbles
out
of
the
nurses
pockets
the
patients
keep
him
under
their
pillows
oh
with
most
of
them
of
course
it
s
just
a
craze
like
the
last
new
game
or
puzzle
they
don
t
understand
him
in
the
least
howland
says
that
even
now
years
after
his
death
and
with
his
books
in
everybody
s
hands
there
are
not
twenty
people
who
really
understand
pellerin
and
howland
ought
to
know
if
anybody
does
he
s
what
s
their
great
word
him
you
must
get
howland
to
put
you
through
a
course
of
and
as
the
young
men
having
taken
leave
of
winterman
retraced
their
way
across
the
lawn
wade
continued
to
develop
the
theme
of
his
brother
s
accomplishments
i
wish
i
get
howland
to
take
an
interest
in
winterman
this
is
the
third
sunday
he
s
chucked
us
of
course
he
does
get
bored
with
people
consulting
him
about
their
writings
but
i
believe
if
he
could
only
talk
to
winterman
he
d
see
something
in
him
as
we
do
and
it
would
be
such
a
to
the
poor
man
to
have
some
one
to
advise
him
about
his
work
i
m
going
to
make
a
desperate
effort
to
get
howland
here
next
it
was
then
that
bernald
vowed
to
himself
that
he
would
return
the
next
sunday
at
all
costs
he
hardly
knew
whether
he
was
prompted
by
the
impulse
to
shield
winterman
from
howland
wade
s
ineptitude
or
by
the
desire
to
see
the
latter
abandon
himself
to
the
full
shamelessness
of
its
display
but
of
one
fact
he
was
blissfully
assured
and
that
was
of
the
existence
in
winterman
of
some
quality
which
would
provoke
howland
to
the
amplest
exercise
of
his
fatuity
how
he
ll
draw
him
how
he
ll
draw
him
bernald
chuckled
with
a
security
the
more
unaccountable
that
his
one
glimpse
of
winterman
had
shown
the
latter
only
as
a
passive
subject
for
experimentation
and
he
felt
himself
avenged
in
advance
for
the
injury
of
howland
wade
s
existence
iii
that
this
hope
was
to
be
frustrated
bernald
learned
from
howland
wade
s
own
lips
the
day
before
the
two
young
men
were
to
meet
at
portchester
i
can
t
really
my
dear
fellow
the
interpreter
lisped
passing
a
polished
hand
over
the
faded
smoothness
of
his
face
oh
an
authentic
engagement
i
assure
you
otherwise
to
oblige
old
bob
i
d
submit
cheerfully
to
looking
over
his
foundling
s
literature
but
i
m
pledged
this
week
to
the
pellerin
society
of
kenosha
i
had
a
hand
in
founding
it
and
for
two
years
now
they
ve
been
patiently
waiting
for
a
word
from
me
the
so
to
speak
you
see
it
s
a
ministry
bernald
i
assure
you
i
look
upon
my
calling
quite
as
bernald
listened
his
disappointment
gradually
changed
to
relief
howland
on
trial
always
turned
out
to
be
too
insufferable
and
the
pleasure
of
watching
his
antics
was
invariably
lost
in
the
impulse
to
put
a
sanguinary
end
to
them
if
he
d
only
keep
his
beastly
pink
hands
off
pellerin
bernald
groaned
thinking
of
the
thick
manuscript
condemned
to
perpetual
incarceration
in
his
own
desk
by
the
publication
of
howland
s
definitive
work
on
the
great
man
one
couldn
t
wade
expose
one
s
self
to
the
derision
of
writing
about
pellerin
the
eagerness
with
which
wade
s
book
had
been
devoured
proved
not
that
the
public
had
enough
appetite
for
another
but
simply
that
for
a
stomach
so
undiscriminating
anything
better
than
wade
had
given
it
would
be
too
good
and
bernald
in
the
confidence
that
his
own
work
was
open
to
this
objection
had
stoically
locked
it
up
yet
if
he
had
resigned
his
exasperated
intelligence
to
the
fact
that
wade
s
book
existed
and
was
already
passing
into
the
immortality
of
perpetual
republication
he
could
not
after
repeated
trials
adjust
himself
to
the
author
s
talk
about
pellerin
when
wade
wrote
of
the
great
dead
he
was
egregious
but
in
conversation
he
was
familiar
and
fond
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
one
of
the
beauties
of
pellerin
s
hidden
life
and
mysterious
taking
off
would
have
been
to
guard
him
from
the
fingering
of
anecdote
but
biographers
like
howland
wade
were
born
to
rise
above
such
obstacles
he
might
be
vague
or
inaccurate
in
dealing
with
the
few
recorded
events
of
his
subject
s
life
but
when
he
left
fact
for
conjecture
no
one
had
a
firmer
footing
whole
chapters
in
his
volume
were
constructed
in
the
conditional
mood
and
packed
with
hypothetical
detail
and
in
talk
by
the
very
law
of
the
process
hypothesis
became
affirmation
and
he
was
ready
to
tell
you
confidentially
the
exact
circumstances
of
pellerin
s
death
and
of
the
distressing
incident
leading
up
to
it
bernald
himself
not
only
questioned
the
form
under
which
this
incident
was
shaping
itself
before
posterity
but
the
mere
radical
fact
of
its
occurrence
he
had
never
been
able
to
discover
any
break
in
the
dense
cloud
enveloping
pellerin
s
later
life
and
its
mysterious
termination
he
had
gone
away
that
was
all
that
any
of
them
knew
he
who
had
so
little
at
any
time
been
with
them
or
of
them
and
his
going
had
so
slightly
stirred
the
public
consciousness
that
even
the
subsequent
news
of
his
death
laconically
imparted
from
afar
had
dropped
unheeded
into
the
universal
to
be
long
afterward
fished
out
with
all
its
details
missing
when
some
enquiring
spirit
first
became
aware
by
chance
encounter
with
a
volume
in
a
london
not
only
that
such
a
man
as
john
pellerin
had
died
but
that
he
had
ever
lived
or
written
it
need
hardly
be
noted
that
howland
wade
had
not
been
the
pioneer
in
question
his
had
been
the
wiser
part
of
swelling
the
chorus
when
it
rose
and
gradually
drowning
the
other
voices
by
his
own
insistent
note
he
had
pitched
the
note
so
screamingly
and
held
it
so
long
that
he
was
now
the
accepted
authority
on
pellerin
not
only
in
the
land
which
had
given
birth
to
his
genius
but
in
the
europe
which
had
first
acclaimed
it
and
it
was
the
central
point
of
pain
in
bernald
s
sense
of
the
situation
that
a
man
who
had
so
yearned
for
silence
as
pellerin
should
have
his
grave
piped
over
by
such
a
voice
as
wade
s
bernald
s
talk
with
the
interpreter
had
revived
this
ache
to
the
momentary
exclusion
of
other
sensations
and
he
was
still
sore
with
it
when
the
next
afternoon
he
arrived
at
portchester
for
his
second
sunday
with
the
wades
at
the
station
he
had
the
surprise
of
seeing
winterman
s
face
on
the
platform
and
of
hearing
from
him
that
doctor
bob
had
been
called
away
to
assist
at
an
operation
in
a
distant
town
mrs
wade
wanted
to
put
you
off
but
i
believe
the
message
came
too
late
so
she
sent
me
down
to
break
the
news
to
you
said
winterman
holding
out
his
hand
perhaps
because
they
were
the
first
conventional
words
that
bernald
had
heard
him
speak
the
young
man
was
struck
by
the
relief
his
intonation
gave
them
she
wanted
to
send
a
carriage
winterman
added
but
i
told
her
we
d
walk
back
through
the
he
looked
at
bernald
with
a
sudden
kindness
that
flushed
the
young
man
with
pleasure
are
you
strong
enough
it
s
not
too
far
oh
no
i
m
pulling
myself
together
getting
back
to
work
is
the
slowest
part
of
the
business
not
on
account
of
my
eyes
i
can
use
them
now
though
not
for
reading
but
some
of
the
links
between
things
are
missing
it
s
a
kind
of
broken
spectrum
here
that
boy
will
look
after
your
the
walk
through
the
woods
remained
in
bernald
s
memory
as
an
enchanted
hour
he
used
the
word
literally
as
descriptive
of
the
way
in
which
winterman
s
contact
changed
the
face
of
things
or
perhaps
restored
them
to
their
primitive
meanings
and
the
scene
they
traversed
one
of
those
little
untended
woods
that
still
in
america
fringe
the
tawdry
skirts
of
civilization
acquired
as
a
background
to
winterman
the
hush
of
a
spot
aware
of
transcendent
visitings
did
he
talk
or
did
he
make
bernald
talk
the
young
man
never
knew
he
recalled
only
a
sense
of
lightness
and
liberation
as
if
the
hard
walls
of
individuality
had
melted
and
he
were
merged
in
the
poet
s
deeper
interfusion
yet
without
losing
the
least
sharp
edge
of
self
this
general
impression
resolved
itself
afterward
into
the
sense
of
winterman
s
wide
elemental
range
his
thought
encircled
things
like
the
horizon
at
sea
he
didn
t
as
it
happened
touch
on
lofty
themes
bernald
was
gleefully
aware
that
to
howland
wade
their
talk
would
hardly
have
been
talk
at
all
but
winterman
s
mind
applied
to
lowly
topics
was
like
a
powerful
lens
that
brought
out
microscopic
delicacies
and
differences
the
lack
of
sunday
trains
kept
doctor
bob
for
two
days
on
the
scene
of
his
surgical
duties
and
during
those
two
days
bernald
seized
every
moment
of
communion
with
his
friend
s
guest
winterman
as
wade
had
said
was
reticent
as
to
his
personal
affairs
or
rather
as
to
the
practical
and
material
conditions
to
which
the
term
is
generally
applied
but
it
was
evident
that
in
winterman
s
case
the
usual
classification
must
be
reversed
and
that
the
discussion
of
ideas
carried
one
much
farther
into
his
intimacy
than
any
specific
acquaintance
with
the
incidents
of
his
life
that
s
exactly
what
howland
wade
and
his
tribe
have
never
understood
about
pellerin
that
it
s
much
less
important
to
know
how
or
even
why
he
disapp
bernald
pulled
himself
up
with
a
jerk
and
turned
to
look
full
at
his
companion
it
was
late
on
the
monday
evening
and
the
two
men
after
an
hour
s
chat
on
the
verandah
to
the
tune
of
wade
s
had
bidden
their
hostess
and
strolled
back
to
the
bungalow
together
come
and
have
a
pipe
before
you
turn
in
winterman
had
said
and
they
had
sat
on
together
till
midnight
with
the
door
of
the
bungalow
open
on
a
heaving
moonlit
bay
and
summer
insects
bumping
against
the
chimney
of
the
lamp
winterman
had
just
bent
down
to
his
pipe
from
the
jar
on
the
table
and
bernald
jerking
about
to
catch
him
in
the
yellow
circle
of
lamplight
sat
speechless
staring
at
a
fact
that
seemed
suddenly
to
have
substituted
itself
for
winterman
s
face
or
rather
to
have
taken
on
its
features
no
they
never
saw
that
pellerin
s
ideas
pellerin
he
continued
to
stare
at
winterman
just
as
this
man
s
ideas
are
why
pellerin
the
thought
uttered
itself
in
a
kind
of
inner
shout
and
bernald
started
upright
with
the
violent
impact
of
his
conclusion
again
and
again
in
the
last
hours
he
had
exclaimed
to
himself
this
is
as
good
as
why
hadn
t
he
said
till
now
this
pellerin
surprising
as
the
answer
was
he
had
no
choice
but
to
take
it
he
hadn
t
said
so
simply
because
winterman
was
than
that
there
was
so
much
more
of
him
so
to
speak
yes
but
it
came
to
bernald
in
a
flash
wouldn
t
there
by
this
time
have
been
any
amount
more
of
pellerin
the
young
man
felt
actually
dizzy
with
the
thought
that
was
it
there
was
the
solution
of
the
haunting
problem
this
man
was
pellerin
and
more
than
pellerin
it
was
so
fantastic
and
yet
so
unanswerable
that
he
burst
into
a
sudden
startled
laugh
winterman
at
the
same
moment
brought
his
palm
down
with
a
sudden
crash
on
the
pile
of
manuscript
covering
the
desk
what
s
the
matter
bernald
gasped
my
match
wasn
t
out
in
another
minute
the
destruction
of
the
library
of
alexandria
would
have
been
a
trifle
compared
to
what
you
d
have
winterman
with
his
large
deep
laugh
shook
out
the
smouldering
sheets
and
i
should
have
been
a
pensioner
on
doctor
bob
the
lord
knows
how
much
longer
bernald
pulled
himself
together
you
ve
really
got
going
again
the
thing
s
actually
getting
into
shape
this
particular
thing
in
shape
i
drove
at
it
hard
all
last
week
thinking
our
friend
s
brother
would
be
down
on
sunday
and
might
look
it
bernald
had
to
repress
the
tendency
to
another
wild
laugh
howland
you
meant
to
show
what
you
ve
done
winterman
looming
against
the
moonlight
slowly
turned
a
dusky
shaggy
head
toward
him
isn
t
it
a
good
thing
to
do
bernald
wavered
torn
between
loyalty
to
his
friends
and
the
grotesqueness
of
answering
in
the
affirmative
after
all
it
was
none
of
his
business
to
furnish
winterman
with
an
estimate
of
howland
wade
well
you
see
you
ve
never
told
me
what
your
line
he
answered
temporizing
no
because
nobody
s
ever
told
it
s
exactly
what
i
want
to
find
out
said
the
other
genially
and
you
expect
wade
why
i
gathered
from
our
good
doctor
that
it
s
his
trade
doesn
t
he
explain
interpret
in
his
own
domain
which
is
winterman
gazed
out
musingly
upon
the
dusk
of
waters
and
what
pellerinism
he
asked
bernald
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
ah
i
don
t
know
but
you
re
pellerin
they
stood
for
a
minute
facing
each
other
among
the
uncertain
swaying
shadows
of
the
room
with
the
sea
breathing
through
it
as
something
immense
and
inarticulate
breathed
through
young
bernald
s
thoughts
then
winterman
threw
up
his
arms
with
a
humorous
gesture
don
t
shoot
he
said
iv
dawn
found
them
there
and
the
risen
sun
laid
its
beams
on
the
rough
floor
of
the
bungalow
before
either
of
the
men
was
conscious
of
the
passage
of
time
bernald
vaguely
trying
to
define
his
own
state
in
retrospect
could
only
phrase
it
i
floated
floated
the
gist
of
fact
at
the
core
of
the
extraordinary
experience
was
simply
that
john
pellerin
years
earlier
had
voluntarily
disappeared
causing
the
rumour
of
his
death
to
be
reported
to
an
inattentive
world
and
that
now
he
had
come
back
to
see
what
that
world
had
made
of
him
you
ll
hardly
believe
it
of
me
i
hardly
believe
it
of
myself
but
i
went
away
in
a
rage
of
disappointment
of
wounded
pride
no
vanity
i
don
t
know
which
cut
deepest
the
sneers
or
the
silence
but
between
them
there
wasn
t
an
inch
of
me
that
wasn
t
raw
i
had
just
the
one
thing
in
me
the
message
the
cry
the
revelation
but
nobody
saw
and
nobody
listened
nobody
wanted
what
i
had
to
give
i
was
like
a
poor
devil
of
a
tramp
looking
for
shelter
on
a
bitter
night
in
a
town
with
every
door
bolted
and
all
the
windows
dark
and
suddenly
i
felt
that
the
easiest
thing
would
be
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
in
the
snow
perhaps
i
d
a
vague
notion
that
if
they
found
me
there
at
daylight
frozen
stiff
the
pathetic
spectacle
might
produce
a
reaction
a
feeling
of
remorse
so
i
took
care
to
be
found
well
a
good
many
thousand
people
die
every
day
on
the
face
of
the
globe
and
i
soon
discovered
that
i
was
simply
one
of
the
thousands
and
when
i
made
that
discovery
i
really
died
and
stayed
dead
a
year
or
two
when
i
came
to
life
again
i
was
off
on
the
under
side
of
the
world
in
regions
unaware
of
what
we
know
as
the
have
you
any
notion
how
it
shifts
the
point
of
view
to
wake
under
new
constellations
i
advise
any
who
s
been
in
love
with
a
woman
under
cassiopeia
to
go
and
think
about
her
under
the
southern
cross
it
s
the
only
way
to
tell
the
pivotal
truths
from
the
others
i
didn
t
believe
in
my
theory
any
less
there
was
my
triumph
and
my
vindication
it
held
out
resisted
measured
itself
with
the
stars
but
i
didn
t
care
a
snap
of
my
finger
whether
anybody
else
believed
in
it
or
even
knew
it
had
been
formulated
it
escaped
out
of
my
books
my
poor
books
like
psyche
from
the
chrysalis
and
soared
away
into
the
blue
and
lived
there
i
knew
then
how
it
frees
an
idea
to
be
ignored
how
apprehension
circumscribes
and
deforms
it
once
i
d
learned
that
it
was
easy
enough
to
turn
to
and
shift
for
myself
i
was
sure
now
that
my
idea
would
live
the
good
ones
are
i
had
to
learn
to
be
so
and
i
tried
my
hand
at
a
number
of
things
adventurous
menial
commercial
it
s
not
a
bad
thing
for
a
man
to
have
to
live
his
life
and
we
nearly
all
manage
to
dodge
it
our
first
round
with
the
sphinx
may
strike
something
out
of
us
a
book
or
a
picture
or
a
symphony
and
we
re
amazed
at
our
feat
and
go
on
letting
that
first
work
breed
others
as
some
animal
forms
reproduce
each
other
without
renewed
fertilization
so
there
we
are
committed
to
our
first
guess
at
the
riddle
and
our
works
look
as
like
as
successive
impressions
of
the
same
plate
each
with
the
lines
a
little
fainter
whereas
they
ought
to
be
if
we
touch
earth
between
times
as
different
from
each
other
as
those
other
creatures
jellyfish
aren
t
they
of
a
kind
where
successive
generations
produce
new
forms
and
it
takes
a
zoologist
to
see
the
hidden
likeness
well
i
proved
my
first
guess
off
there
in
the
wilds
and
it
lived
and
grew
and
took
care
of
itself
and
i
said
some
day
it
will
make
itself
heard
but
by
that
time
my
atoms
will
have
waltzed
into
a
new
then
in
cashmere
one
day
i
met
a
fellow
in
a
caravan
with
a
book
in
his
pocket
he
said
he
never
stirred
without
it
wanted
to
know
where
i
d
been
never
to
have
heard
of
it
it
was
in
its
twentieth
edition
the
globe
spun
round
at
that
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
was
under
the
old
stars
that
s
the
way
it
happens
when
the
ballast
of
vanity
shifts
i
d
lived
a
third
of
a
life
out
there
unconscious
of
human
opinion
because
i
supposed
it
was
unconscious
of
but
now
now
oh
it
was
different
i
wanted
to
know
what
they
said
not
exactly
that
either
i
wanted
to
know
i
d
made
them
there
s
a
difference
and
here
i
am
said
john
pellerin
with
a
pull
at
his
pipe
so
much
bernald
retained
of
his
companion
s
actual
narrative
the
rest
was
swept
away
under
the
tide
of
wonder
that
rose
and
submerged
him
as
pellerin
at
some
indefinitely
later
stage
of
their
talk
picked
up
his
manuscript
and
began
to
read
bernald
sat
opposite
his
elbows
propped
on
the
table
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
swaying
waters
outside
from
which
the
moon
gradually
faded
leaving
them
to
make
a
denser
blackness
in
the
night
as
pellerin
read
this
density
of
blackness
which
never
for
a
moment
seemed
inert
or
unalive
was
attenuated
by
imperceptible
degrees
till
a
greyish
pallour
replaced
it
then
the
pallour
breathed
and
brightened
and
suddenly
dawn
was
on
the
sea
something
of
the
same
nature
went
on
in
the
young
man
s
mind
while
he
watched
and
listened
he
was
conscious
of
a
gradually
withdrawing
light
of
an
interval
of
obscurity
full
of
the
stir
of
invisible
forces
and
then
of
the
victorious
flush
of
day
and
as
the
light
rose
he
saw
how
far
he
had
travelled
and
what
wonders
the
night
had
prepared
pellerin
had
been
right
in
saying
that
his
first
idea
had
survived
had
borne
the
test
of
time
but
he
had
given
his
hearer
no
hint
of
the
extent
to
which
it
had
been
enlarged
and
modified
of
the
fresh
implications
it
now
unfolded
in
a
brief
flash
of
retrospection
bernald
saw
the
earlier
books
dwindle
and
fall
into
their
place
as
mere
precursors
of
this
fuller
revelation
then
with
a
leap
of
helpless
rage
he
pictured
howland
wade
s
pink
hands
on
the
new
treasure
and
his
prophetic
feet
upon
the
lecture
platform
v
it
won
t
do
oh
he
let
him
down
as
gently
as
possible
but
it
appears
it
simply
won
t
doctor
bob
imparted
the
ineluctable
fact
to
bernald
while
the
two
men
accidentally
meeting
at
their
club
a
few
nights
later
sat
together
over
the
dinner
they
had
immediately
agreed
to
consume
in
company
bernald
had
left
portchester
the
morning
after
his
strange
discovery
and
he
and
bob
wade
had
not
seen
each
other
since
and
now
bernald
moved
by
an
irresistible
instinct
of
postponement
had
waited
for
his
companion
to
bring
up
winterman
s
name
and
had
even
executed
several
conversational
diversions
in
the
hope
of
delaying
its
mention
for
how
could
one
talk
of
winterman
with
the
thought
of
pellerin
swelling
one
s
breast
yes
the
very
day
howland
got
back
from
kenosha
i
brought
the
manuscript
to
town
and
got
him
to
read
it
and
yesterday
evening
i
nailed
him
and
dragged
an
answer
out
of
then
howland
hasn
t
seen
winterman
yet
no
he
said
before
you
let
him
loose
on
me
i
ll
go
over
the
stuff
and
see
if
it
s
at
all
worth
bernald
drew
a
freer
breath
and
he
found
it
wasn
t
between
ourselves
he
found
it
was
of
no
account
at
all
queer
isn
t
it
when
the
but
of
course
literature
s
another
proposition
howland
says
it
s
one
of
the
cases
where
an
idea
might
seem
original
and
striking
if
one
didn
t
happen
to
be
able
to
trace
its
descent
and
this
is
straight
out
of
bosh
by
pellerin
yes
pellerin
it
seems
that
everything
in
the
article
that
isn
t
pure
nonsense
is
just
pellerinism
howland
thinks
poor
winterman
must
have
been
tremendously
struck
by
pellerin
s
writings
and
have
lived
too
much
out
of
the
world
to
know
that
they
ve
become
the
of
modern
thought
otherwise
of
course
he
d
have
taken
more
trouble
to
disguise
his
i
see
bernald
mused
yet
you
say
there
an
original
element
yes
but
unluckily
it
s
no
it
s
not
conceivably
in
any
sense
a
development
of
pellerin
s
idea
a
logical
step
farther
howland
says
it
s
twaddle
at
white
bernald
sat
silent
divided
between
the
fierce
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
interpreter
rush
upon
his
fate
and
the
despair
of
knowing
that
the
state
of
mind
he
represented
was
indestructible
then
both
emotions
were
swept
away
on
a
wave
of
pure
joy
as
he
reflected
that
now
at
last
howland
wade
had
given
him
back
john
pellerin
the
possession
was
one
he
did
not
mean
to
part
with
lightly
and
the
dread
of
its
being
torn
from
him
constrained
him
to
extraordinary
precautions
you
ve
told
winterman
i
suppose
how
did
he
take
it
why
unexpectedly
as
he
does
most
things
you
can
never
tell
which
way
he
ll
jump
i
thought
he
d
take
a
high
tone
or
else
laugh
it
off
but
he
did
neither
he
seemed
awfully
cast
down
i
wished
myself
well
out
of
the
job
when
i
saw
how
cut
up
he
bernald
thrilled
at
the
words
pellerin
had
shared
his
pang
then
the
old
woe
of
the
world
at
the
perpetuity
of
human
dulness
but
what
did
he
say
to
the
charge
of
plagiarism
if
you
made
it
oh
i
told
him
straight
out
what
howland
said
i
thought
it
fairer
and
his
answer
to
that
was
the
rummest
part
of
what
was
it
bernald
questioned
with
a
tremor
he
said
that
s
queer
for
i
ve
never
read
bernald
drew
a
deep
breath
of
ecstasy
well
and
i
suppose
you
believed
him
i
believed
him
because
i
know
him
but
the
public
won
t
the
critics
won
t
and
if
it
s
a
pure
coincidence
it
s
just
as
bad
for
him
as
if
it
were
a
straight
steal
isn
t
it
bernald
sighed
his
acquiescence
it
bothers
me
awfully
wade
continued
knitting
his
kindly
brows
because
i
could
see
what
a
blow
it
was
to
him
he
s
got
to
earn
his
living
and
i
don
t
suppose
he
knows
how
to
do
anything
else
at
his
age
it
s
hard
to
start
fresh
i
put
that
to
howland
asked
him
if
there
wasn
t
a
chance
he
might
do
better
if
he
only
had
a
little
encouragement
i
can
t
help
feeling
he
s
got
the
essential
thing
in
him
but
of
course
i
m
no
judge
when
it
comes
to
books
and
howland
says
it
would
be
cruel
to
give
him
any
wade
paused
turned
his
wineglass
about
under
a
meditative
stare
and
then
leaned
across
the
table
toward
bernald
look
here
do
you
know
what
i
ve
proposed
to
winterman
that
he
should
come
to
town
with
me
and
go
in
the
evening
to
hear
howland
lecture
to
the
uplift
club
they
re
to
meet
at
beecher
bain
s
and
howland
is
to
repeat
the
lecture
that
he
gave
the
other
day
before
the
pellerin
society
at
kenosha
it
will
give
winterman
a
chance
to
get
some
notion
of
what
pellerin
he
ll
get
it
much
straighter
from
howland
than
if
he
tried
to
plough
through
pellerin
s
books
and
then
afterward
as
if
accidentally
i
thought
i
might
bring
him
and
howland
together
if
howland
could
only
see
him
and
hear
him
talk
there
s
no
knowing
what
might
come
of
it
he
couldn
t
help
feeling
the
man
s
force
as
we
do
and
he
might
give
him
a
pointer
tell
him
what
line
to
take
anyhow
it
would
please
winterman
and
take
the
edge
off
his
disappointment
i
saw
that
as
soon
as
i
proposed
some
one
who
s
never
heard
of
pellerin
beecher
bain
large
smiling
diffuse
reached
out
parenthetically
from
the
incoming
throng
on
her
threshold
to
waylay
bernald
with
the
question
as
he
was
about
to
move
past
her
in
the
wake
of
his
companion
oh
keep
straight
on
winterman
she
interrupted
herself
to
call
after
the
latter
into
the
back
please
and
remember
you
re
to
sit
next
to
me
in
the
corner
on
the
left
close
under
the
she
renewed
her
interrogative
clutch
on
bernald
s
sleeve
most
curious
doctor
wade
has
been
telling
me
all
about
him
how
remarkable
you
all
think
him
and
it
s
actually
true
that
he
s
never
heard
of
pellerin
of
course
as
soon
as
doctor
wade
told
me
i
said
bring
him
it
will
be
so
extraordinarily
interesting
to
watch
the
first
yes
do
follow
him
dear
bernald
and
be
sure
that
you
and
he
secure
the
seats
next
to
me
of
course
alice
fosdick
insists
on
being
with
us
she
was
wild
with
excitement
when
i
told
her
she
was
to
meet
some
one
who
d
never
heard
of
pellerin
on
the
indulgent
lips
of
beecher
bain
conjecture
speedily
passed
into
affirmation
and
as
bernald
s
companion
broad
and
shaggy
in
his
visibly
new
evening
clothes
moved
down
the
length
of
the
crowded
rooms
he
was
already
to
the
ladies
drawing
aside
their
skirts
to
let
him
pass
the
interesting
huron
of
the
fable
how
far
he
was
aware
of
the
character
ascribed
to
him
it
was
impossible
for
bernald
to
discover
he
was
as
unconscious
as
a
tree
or
a
cloud
and
his
observer
had
never
known
any
one
so
alive
to
human
contacts
and
yet
so
secure
from
them
but
the
scene
was
playing
such
a
lively
tune
on
bernald
s
own
sensibilities
that
for
the
moment
he
could
not
adjust
himself
to
the
probable
effect
it
produced
on
his
companion
the
young
man
of
late
had
made
but
rare
appearances
in
the
group
of
which
beecher
bain
was
one
of
the
most
indefatigable
hostesses
and
the
uplift
club
the
chief
medium
of
expression
to
a
critic
obliged
by
his
trade
to
cultivate
convictions
it
was
the
essence
of
luxury
to
leave
them
at
home
in
his
hours
of
ease
and
bernald
gave
his
preference
to
circles
in
which
less
finality
of
judgment
prevailed
and
it
was
consequently
less
embarrassing
to
be
caught
without
an
opinion
but
in
his
fresher
days
he
had
known
the
spell
of
the
uplift
club
and
the
thrill
of
moving
among
the
emancipated
and
he
felt
an
odd
sense
of
rejuvenation
as
he
looked
at
the
rows
of
faces
packed
about
the
embowered
platform
from
which
howland
wade
was
presently
to
hand
down
the
eternal
verities
many
of
these
countenances
belonged
to
the
old
days
when
the
gospel
of
pellerin
was
unknown
and
it
required
considerable
intellectual
courage
to
avow
one
s
acceptance
of
the
very
doctrines
he
had
since
demolished
the
latter
moral
revolution
seemed
to
have
been
accepted
as
submissively
as
a
change
in
and
it
even
struck
bernald
that
in
the
case
of
many
of
the
assembled
ladies
their
convictions
were
rather
newer
than
their
clothes
one
of
the
most
interesting
examples
of
this
facility
of
adaptation
was
actually
in
the
person
of
miss
alice
fosdick
brushing
his
elbow
with
exotic
amulets
and
enveloping
him
in
arabian
odours
as
she
leaned
forward
to
murmur
her
sympathetic
sense
of
the
situation
miss
fosdick
who
was
one
of
the
most
advanced
exponents
of
pellerinism
had
large
eyes
and
a
plaintive
mouth
and
bernald
had
always
fancied
that
she
might
have
been
pretty
if
she
had
not
been
perpetually
explaining
things
yes
i
know
isabella
bain
told
me
all
about
him
he
can
t
hear
us
can
he
and
i
wonder
if
you
realize
how
remarkably
interesting
it
is
that
we
should
have
such
an
opportunity
i
mean
the
opportunity
to
see
the
impression
of
pellerinism
on
a
perfectly
fresh
mind
you
must
introduce
him
as
soon
as
the
lecture
s
over
i
explained
that
to
isabella
as
soon
as
she
showed
me
doctor
wade
s
note
of
course
you
see
why
don
t
you
bernald
made
a
faint
motion
of
acquiescence
which
she
instantly
swept
aside
at
least
i
think
i
can
you
see
if
you
re
sure
he
can
t
hear
why
it
s
just
this
pellerinism
is
in
danger
of
becoming
a
truism
oh
it
s
an
awful
thing
to
say
but
then
i
m
not
afraid
of
saying
awful
things
i
rather
believe
it
s
my
mission
what
i
mean
is
that
we
re
getting
into
the
way
of
taking
pellerin
for
granted
as
we
do
the
air
we
breathe
we
don
t
sufficiently
lead
our
in
him
we
re
gradually
letting
him
become
she
swayed
closer
to
the
young
man
and
he
saw
that
she
was
making
a
graceful
attempt
to
throw
her
explanatory
net
over
his
companion
who
evading
bain
s
hospitable
signal
had
cautiously
wedged
himself
into
a
seat
between
bernald
and
the
wall
you
hear
what
i
was
saying
winterman
yes
i
know
who
you
are
of
course
oh
well
i
don
t
really
mind
if
you
did
i
was
talking
about
you
about
you
and
pellerin
i
was
explaining
to
bernald
that
what
we
need
at
this
very
minute
is
a
pellerin
revival
and
we
need
some
one
like
you
to
whom
his
message
comes
as
a
wonderful
new
interpretation
of
life
to
lead
the
revival
and
rouse
us
out
of
our
apathy
you
see
she
went
on
winningly
it
s
not
only
the
big
public
that
needs
it
of
course
pellerin
isn
t
ours
it
s
we
his
disciples
his
interpreters
who
discovered
him
and
gave
him
to
the
world
we
the
chosen
people
the
custodians
of
the
sacred
books
as
howland
wade
calls
us
it
s
who
are
in
perpetual
danger
of
sinking
back
into
the
old
stagnant
ideals
and
practising
the
seven
deadly
virtues
it
s
who
need
to
count
our
mercies
and
realize
anew
what
he
s
done
for
us
and
what
we
ought
to
do
for
him
and
it
s
for
that
reason
that
i
urged
wade
to
speak
here
in
the
very
inner
sanctuary
of
pellerinism
exactly
as
he
would
speak
to
the
uninitiated
to
repeat
simply
his
kenosha
lecture
what
pellerinism
means
and
we
ought
all
i
think
to
listen
to
him
with
the
hearts
of
little
children
just
as
will
winterman
as
if
he
were
telling
us
new
things
and
we
alice
bain
murmured
with
a
deprecating
gesture
and
howland
wade
emerging
between
the
palms
took
the
centre
of
the
platform
a
pang
of
commiseration
shot
through
bernald
as
he
saw
him
there
so
innocent
and
so
exposed
his
plump
pulpy
body
which
made
his
evening
dress
fall
into
intimate
and
folds
was
like
a
wide
surface
spread
to
the
shafts
of
irony
and
the
mild
ripples
of
his
voice
seemed
to
enlarge
the
vulnerable
area
as
he
leaned
forward
poised
on
confidential
to
say
persuasively
let
me
try
to
tell
you
what
pellerinism
bernald
moved
restlessly
in
his
seat
he
had
the
obscure
sense
of
being
a
party
to
something
not
wholly
honourable
he
ought
not
to
have
come
he
ought
not
to
have
let
his
companion
come
yet
how
could
he
have
done
otherwise
john
pellerin
s
secret
was
his
own
as
long
as
he
chose
to
remain
john
winterman
it
was
no
one
s
business
to
gainsay
him
and
bernald
s
scruples
were
really
justifiable
only
in
respect
of
his
own
presence
on
the
scene
but
even
in
this
connection
he
ceased
to
feel
them
as
soon
as
howland
wade
began
to
speak
vi
it
had
been
arranged
that
pellerin
after
the
meeting
of
the
uplift
club
should
join
bernald
at
his
rooms
and
spend
the
night
there
instead
of
returning
to
portchester
the
plan
had
been
eagerly
elaborated
by
the
young
man
but
he
had
been
unprepared
for
the
alacrity
with
which
his
wonderful
friend
accepted
it
he
was
beginning
to
see
that
it
was
a
part
of
pellerin
s
wonderfulness
to
fall
in
quite
simply
and
naturally
with
any
arrangements
made
for
his
convenience
or
tending
to
promote
the
convenience
of
others
bernald
felt
that
his
extreme
docility
in
such
matters
was
proportioned
to
the
force
of
resistance
which
for
nearly
half
a
had
kept
him
with
his
back
to
the
wall
fighting
alone
against
the
powers
of
darkness
in
such
a
scale
of
values
how
little
the
small
daily
alternatives
must
weigh
at
the
close
of
howland
wade
s
discourse
bernald
charged
with
his
prodigious
secret
had
felt
the
need
to
escape
for
an
instant
from
the
liberated
rush
of
talk
the
interest
of
watching
pellerin
was
so
perilously
great
that
the
watcher
felt
it
might
at
any
moment
betray
him
he
lingered
in
the
crowded
long
enough
to
see
his
friend
enclosed
in
a
mounting
tide
above
which
beecher
bain
and
miss
fosdick
actively
waved
their
conversational
tridents
then
he
took
refuge
at
the
back
of
the
house
in
a
small
dim
library
where
in
his
younger
days
he
had
discussed
personal
immortality
and
the
problem
of
consciousness
with
beautiful
girls
whose
names
he
could
not
remember
in
this
retreat
he
surprised
beecher
bain
a
quiet
man
with
a
mild
brow
who
was
smoking
a
surreptitious
cigar
over
the
last
number
of
the
bain
at
bernald
s
approach
dissembled
the
under
a
copy
of
the
but
tendered
his
with
the
remark
that
stocks
were
heavy
again
and
bernald
blissfully
abandoned
himself
to
this
unexpected
contact
with
reality
on
his
return
to
the
he
found
that
the
tide
had
set
toward
the
and
when
it
finally
carried
him
thither
it
was
to
land
him
in
the
welcoming
arms
of
bob
wade
hullo
old
man
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
winterman
oh
talking
to
howland
yes
i
managed
it
finally
i
believe
bain
has
steered
them
into
the
library
so
that
they
shan
t
be
disturbed
i
gave
her
an
idea
of
the
situation
and
she
was
awfully
kind
we
d
better
leave
them
alone
don
t
you
think
i
m
trying
to
get
a
croquette
for
miss
bernald
s
secret
leapt
in
his
bosom
and
he
devoted
himself
to
the
task
of
distributing
sandwiches
and
champagne
while
his
pulses
danced
to
the
tune
of
the
cosmic
laughter
the
vision
of
pellerin
and
his
interpreter
face
to
face
at
last
had
a
cyclopean
grandeur
that
dwarfed
all
other
comedy
and
i
shall
hear
of
it
presently
in
an
hour
or
two
he
ll
be
telling
me
about
it
and
that
hour
will
be
all
mine
mine
and
his
the
dizziness
of
the
thought
made
it
difficult
for
bernald
to
preserve
the
balance
of
the
he
was
distributing
life
had
for
him
at
that
moment
the
completeness
which
seems
to
defy
disintegration
the
throng
in
the
was
thickening
and
bernald
s
efforts
as
purveyor
were
interrupted
by
frequent
appeals
from
ladies
who
had
reached
repleteness
that
he
should
sit
down
a
moment
and
tell
them
all
about
his
interesting
friend
winterman
s
fame
trumpeted
abroad
by
miss
fosdick
had
reached
the
four
corners
of
the
uplift
club
and
bernald
found
himself
fabricating
toutes
a
winterman
legend
which
should
in
some
degree
respond
to
the
club
s
demand
for
the
human
document
when
at
length
he
had
acquitted
himself
of
this
obligation
and
was
free
to
work
his
way
back
through
the
lessening
groups
into
the
he
was
at
last
rewarded
by
a
glimpse
of
his
friend
who
still
densely
encompassed
towered
in
the
centre
of
the
room
in
all
his
sovran
ugliness
their
eyes
met
across
the
crowd
but
bernald
gathered
only
perplexity
from
the
encounter
what
were
pellerin
s
eyes
saying
to
him
what
orders
what
confidences
what
indefinable
apprehension
did
their
long
look
impart
the
young
man
was
still
trying
to
decipher
their
complex
message
when
he
felt
a
tap
on
the
arm
and
turned
to
encounter
the
rueful
gaze
of
bob
wade
whose
meaning
lay
clearly
enough
on
the
surface
of
his
good
blue
stare
well
it
won
t
work
it
won
t
work
the
doctor
groaned
what
won
t
i
mean
with
howland
winterman
won
t
howland
doesn
t
take
to
him
says
he
s
crude
frightfully
crude
and
you
know
how
howland
hates
oh
i
know
bernald
exulted
it
was
the
word
he
had
waited
for
he
saw
it
now
once
more
he
was
lost
in
wonder
at
howland
s
miraculous
faculty
for
always
as
the
naturalists
said
being
true
to
type
so
i
m
afraid
it
s
all
up
with
his
chance
of
writing
at
least
can
do
no
more
said
wade
discouraged
bernald
pressed
him
for
farther
details
does
winterman
seem
to
mind
much
did
you
hear
his
version
his
version
i
mean
what
he
said
to
why
no
what
the
deuce
was
there
for
him
to
say
what
indeed
i
think
i
ll
take
him
home
said
bernald
gaily
he
turned
away
to
join
the
circle
from
which
a
few
minutes
before
pellerin
s
eyes
had
vainly
and
enigmatically
signalled
to
him
but
the
circle
had
dispersed
and
pellerin
himself
was
not
in
sight
bernald
looking
about
him
saw
that
during
his
brief
aside
with
wade
the
party
had
passed
into
the
final
phase
of
dissolution
people
still
delayed
in
diminishing
groups
but
the
current
had
set
toward
the
doors
and
every
moment
or
two
it
bore
away
a
few
more
lingerers
bernald
from
his
post
commanded
the
clearing
perspective
of
the
two
and
a
rapid
survey
of
their
length
sufficed
to
assure
him
that
pellerin
was
not
in
either
taking
leave
of
wade
the
young
man
made
his
way
back
to
the
where
only
a
few
hardened
feasters
remained
and
then
passed
on
to
the
library
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
late
momentous
colloquy
but
the
library
too
was
empty
and
drifting
back
uncertainly
to
the
inner
bernald
found
beecher
bain
domestically
putting
out
the
wax
candles
on
the
dear
bernald
do
sit
down
and
have
a
little
chat
what
a
wonderful
privilege
it
has
been
i
don
t
know
when
i
ve
had
such
an
intense
she
made
way
for
him
hospitably
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
to
which
she
had
sunk
and
he
echoed
her
vaguely
you
impressed
then
i
can
t
express
to
you
how
it
affected
me
as
alice
said
it
was
a
resurrection
it
was
as
if
john
pellerin
were
actually
here
in
the
room
with
us
bernald
turned
on
her
with
a
gasp
you
felt
that
dear
bain
we
all
felt
it
every
one
of
us
i
don
t
wonder
the
greeks
it
the
greeks
regarded
eloquence
as
a
supernatural
power
as
alice
says
when
one
looked
at
howland
wade
one
understood
what
they
meant
by
the
bernald
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
oh
i
see
it
was
howland
who
made
you
feel
as
if
pellerin
were
in
the
room
and
he
made
miss
fosdick
feel
so
too
why
of
course
but
why
are
you
rushing
off
because
i
must
hunt
up
my
friend
who
s
not
used
to
such
late
your
friend
bain
had
to
collect
her
thoughts
oh
winterman
you
mean
but
he
s
gone
gone
bernald
exclaimed
with
an
odd
twinge
of
foreboding
remembering
pellerin
s
signal
across
the
crowd
he
reproached
himself
for
not
having
answered
it
more
promptly
yet
it
was
certainly
strange
that
his
friend
should
have
left
the
house
without
him
are
you
quite
sure
he
asked
with
a
startled
glance
at
the
clock
oh
perfectly
he
went
half
an
hour
ago
but
you
needn
t
hurry
home
on
his
account
for
alice
fosdick
carried
him
off
with
her
i
saw
them
leave
carried
him
off
she
took
him
home
with
her
you
mean
yes
you
know
what
strange
hours
she
keeps
she
told
me
she
was
going
to
give
him
a
welsh
rabbit
and
explain
pellerinism
to
oh
she
s
going
to
explain
bernald
murmured
but
his
amazement
at
the
news
struggled
with
a
confused
impatience
to
reach
his
rooms
in
time
to
be
there
for
his
friend
s
arrival
there
could
be
no
stranger
spectacle
beneath
the
stars
than
that
of
john
pellerin
carried
off
by
miss
fosdick
and
listening
in
the
small
hours
to
her
elucidation
of
his
doctrines
but
bernald
knew
enough
of
his
sex
to
be
aware
that
such
an
experiment
may
present
a
less
humorous
side
to
its
subject
than
to
an
impartial
observer
even
the
uplift
club
and
its
connotations
might
benefit
by
the
attraction
of
the
unknown
and
it
was
conceivable
that
to
a
traveller
from
mesopotamia
miss
fosdick
might
present
elements
of
interest
which
she
had
lost
for
the
frequenters
of
fifth
avenue
there
was
at
any
rate
no
denying
that
the
affair
had
become
unexpectedly
complex
and
that
its
farther
development
promised
to
be
rich
in
comedy
in
the
charmed
contemplation
of
these
possibilities
bernald
sat
over
his
fire
listening
for
pellerin
s
ring
he
had
arranged
his
modest
quarters
with
the
reverent
care
of
a
celebrant
awaiting
the
descent
of
his
deity
he
guessed
pellerin
to
be
unconscious
of
visual
detail
but
sensitive
to
the
happy
blending
of
sensuous
impressions
to
the
intimate
spell
of
lamplight
on
books
and
of
a
deep
chair
placed
where
one
could
watch
the
fire
the
chair
was
there
and
bernald
facing
it
across
the
hearth
already
saw
it
filled
by
pellerin
s
lounging
figure
the
autumn
dawn
came
late
and
even
now
they
had
before
them
the
promise
of
some
untroubled
hours
bernald
sitting
there
alone
in
the
warm
stillness
of
his
room
and
in
the
profounder
hush
of
his
expectancy
was
conscious
of
gathering
up
all
his
sensibilities
and
perceptions
into
one
instrument
of
notation
until
now
he
had
tasted
pellerin
s
society
only
in
unpremeditated
snatches
and
had
always
left
him
with
a
sense
on
his
own
part
of
waste
and
shortcoming
now
in
the
lull
of
this
dedicated
hour
he
felt
that
he
should
miss
nothing
and
forget
nothing
of
the
initiation
that
awaited
him
and
catching
sight
of
pellerin
s
pipe
he
rose
and
laid
it
carefully
on
a
table
by
the
no
i
ve
never
had
any
news
of
him
bernald
heard
himself
repeating
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
and
with
the
automatic
utterance
that
alone
made
it
possible
to
say
the
words
they
were
addressed
to
miss
fosdick
into
whose
neighbourhood
chance
had
thrown
him
at
a
dinner
a
year
or
so
later
than
their
encounter
at
the
uplift
club
hitherto
he
had
successfully
and
intentionally
avoided
miss
fosdick
not
from
any
animosity
toward
that
unconscious
instrument
of
fate
but
from
an
intense
reluctance
to
pronounce
the
words
which
he
knew
he
should
have
to
speak
if
they
met
now
as
it
turned
out
his
chief
surprise
was
that
she
should
wait
so
long
to
make
him
speak
them
all
through
the
dinner
she
had
swept
him
along
on
a
rapid
current
of
talk
which
showed
no
tendency
to
linger
or
turn
back
upon
the
past
at
first
he
ascribed
her
reserve
to
a
sense
of
delicacy
with
which
he
reproached
himself
for
not
having
previously
credited
her
then
he
saw
that
she
had
been
carried
so
far
beyond
the
point
at
which
they
had
last
faced
each
other
that
it
was
by
the
merest
hazard
of
associated
ideas
that
she
was
now
finally
borne
back
to
it
for
it
appeared
that
the
very
next
evening
at
beecher
bain
s
a
hindu
mahatma
was
to
lecture
to
the
uplift
club
on
the
limits
of
the
subliminal
and
it
was
owing
to
no
less
a
person
than
howland
wade
that
this
exceptional
privilege
had
been
obtained
of
course
howland
s
known
all
over
the
world
as
the
interpreter
of
pellerinism
and
the
aga
gautch
who
had
absolutely
declined
to
speak
anywhere
in
public
wrote
to
isabella
that
he
could
not
refuse
anything
that
wade
asked
did
you
know
that
howland
s
lecture
what
pellerinism
means
has
been
translated
into
languages
and
gone
into
a
fifth
edition
in
icelandic
why
that
reminds
me
miss
fosdick
broke
off
i
ve
never
heard
what
became
of
your
queer
friend
what
was
his
name
whom
you
and
bob
wade
accused
me
of
spiriting
away
after
that
very
lecture
and
i
ve
never
seen
since
you
rushed
into
the
house
the
next
morning
and
dragged
me
out
of
bed
to
know
what
i
d
done
with
him
with
a
sharp
effort
bernald
gathered
himself
together
to
have
it
out
well
what
you
do
with
him
he
retorted
she
laughed
her
appreciation
of
his
humour
just
what
i
told
you
of
course
i
said
to
him
on
isabella
s
bernald
looked
at
her
it
s
really
true
then
that
he
didn
t
go
home
with
you
she
bantered
back
have
you
suspected
me
all
this
time
of
hiding
his
remains
in
the
cellar
and
with
a
droop
of
her
fine
lids
she
added
i
wish
he
come
home
with
me
for
he
was
rather
interesting
and
there
were
things
i
think
i
could
have
explained
to
bernald
helped
himself
to
a
nectarine
and
miss
fosdick
continued
on
a
note
of
amused
curiosity
so
you
ve
really
never
had
any
news
of
him
since
that
night
no
i
ve
never
had
any
news
of
not
the
least
little
message
not
the
least
little
or
a
rumour
or
report
of
any
kind
or
a
rumour
or
report
of
any
miss
fosdick
s
interest
seemed
to
be
revived
by
the
strangeness
of
the
case
it
s
rather
creepy
isn
t
it
what
have
happened
you
don
t
suppose
he
could
have
been
waylaid
and
murdered
she
asked
with
brightening
eyes
bernald
shook
his
head
serenely
no
i
m
sure
he
s
safe
quite
but
if
you
re
sure
you
must
know
no
i
know
nothing
he
repeated
she
scanned
him
incredulously
but
what
s
your
theory
for
you
must
have
a
theory
what
in
the
world
can
have
become
of
him
bernald
returned
her
look
and
hesitated
do
you
happen
to
remember
the
last
thing
he
said
to
you
the
very
last
on
the
when
he
left
you
the
last
thing
she
poised
her
fork
above
the
peach
on
her
plate
i
don
t
think
he
said
anything
oh
yes
when
i
reminded
him
that
he
d
solemnly
promised
to
come
back
with
me
and
have
a
little
talk
he
said
he
couldn
t
because
he
was
going
well
then
i
suppose
said
bernald
he
went
she
glanced
at
him
as
if
suspecting
a
trap
dear
me
how
flat
i
always
inclined
to
a
mysterious
murder
but
of
course
you
know
more
of
him
than
you
she
began
to
cut
her
peach
but
paused
above
a
lifted
bit
to
ask
with
a
renewal
of
animation
in
her
expressive
eyes
by
the
way
had
you
heard
that
howland
wade
has
been
gradually
getting
farther
and
farther
away
from
pellerinism
it
seems
he
s
begun
to
feel
that
there
s
a
positivist
element
in
it
which
is
narrowing
to
any
one
who
has
gone
at
all
deeply
into
the
wisdom
of
the
east
he
was
intensely
interesting
about
it
the
other
day
and
of
course
i
see
what
he
feels
oh
it
s
too
long
to
tell
you
now
but
if
you
could
manage
to
come
in
to
tea
some
afternoon
soon
any
day
but
wednesday
i
should
so
like
to
explain
the
eyes
i
we
had
been
put
in
the
mood
for
ghosts
that
evening
after
an
excellent
dinner
at
our
old
friend
culwin
s
by
a
tale
of
fred
murchard
s
the
narrative
of
a
strange
personal
visitation
seen
through
the
haze
of
our
cigars
and
by
the
drowsy
gleam
of
a
coal
fire
culwin
s
library
with
its
oak
walls
and
dark
old
bindings
made
a
good
setting
for
such
evocations
and
ghostly
experiences
at
first
hand
being
after
murchard
s
brilliant
opening
the
only
kind
acceptable
to
us
we
proceeded
to
take
stock
of
our
group
and
tax
each
member
for
a
contribution
there
were
eight
of
us
and
seven
contrived
in
a
manner
more
or
less
adequate
to
fulfil
the
condition
imposed
it
surprised
us
all
to
find
that
we
could
muster
such
a
show
of
supernatural
impressions
for
none
of
us
excepting
murchard
himself
and
young
phil
frenham
whose
story
was
the
slightest
of
the
lot
had
the
habit
of
sending
our
souls
into
the
invisible
so
that
on
the
whole
we
had
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
our
seven
exhibits
and
none
of
us
would
have
dreamed
of
expecting
an
eighth
from
our
host
our
old
friend
andrew
culwin
who
had
sat
back
in
his
listening
and
blinking
through
the
smoke
circles
with
the
cheerful
tolerance
of
a
wise
old
idol
was
not
the
kind
of
man
likely
to
be
favoured
with
such
contacts
though
he
had
imagination
enough
to
enjoy
without
envying
the
superior
privileges
of
his
guests
by
age
and
by
education
he
belonged
to
the
stout
positivist
tradition
and
his
habit
of
thought
had
been
formed
in
the
days
of
the
epic
struggle
between
physics
and
metaphysics
but
he
had
been
then
and
always
essentially
a
spectator
a
humorous
detached
observer
of
the
immense
muddled
variety
show
of
life
slipping
out
of
his
seat
now
and
then
for
a
brief
dip
into
the
convivialities
at
the
back
of
the
house
but
never
as
far
as
one
knew
showing
the
least
desire
to
jump
on
the
stage
and
do
a
among
his
contemporaries
there
lingered
a
vague
tradition
of
his
having
at
a
remote
period
and
in
a
romantic
clime
been
wounded
in
a
duel
but
this
legend
no
more
tallied
with
what
we
younger
men
knew
of
his
character
than
my
mother
s
assertion
that
he
had
once
been
a
charming
little
man
with
nice
eyes
corresponded
to
any
possible
reconstitution
of
his
dry
thwarted
physiognomy
he
never
can
have
looked
like
anything
but
a
bundle
of
sticks
murchard
had
once
said
of
him
or
a
phosphorescent
log
rather
some
one
else
amended
and
we
recognized
the
happiness
of
this
description
of
his
small
squat
trunk
with
the
red
blink
of
the
eyes
in
a
face
like
mottled
bark
he
had
always
been
possessed
of
a
leisure
which
he
had
nursed
and
protected
instead
of
squandering
it
in
vain
activities
his
carefully
guarded
hours
had
been
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
a
fine
intelligence
and
a
few
judiciously
chosen
habits
and
none
of
the
disturbances
common
to
human
experience
seemed
to
have
crossed
his
sky
nevertheless
his
dispassionate
survey
of
the
universe
had
not
raised
his
opinion
of
that
costly
experiment
and
his
study
of
the
human
race
seemed
to
have
resulted
in
the
conclusion
that
all
men
were
superfluous
and
women
necessary
only
because
some
one
had
to
do
the
cooking
on
the
importance
of
this
point
his
convictions
were
absolute
and
gastronomy
was
the
only
science
which
he
revered
as
dogma
it
must
be
owned
that
his
little
dinners
were
a
strong
argument
in
favour
of
this
view
besides
being
a
reason
though
not
the
main
one
for
the
fidelity
of
his
friends
mentally
he
exercised
a
hospitality
less
seductive
but
no
less
stimulating
his
mind
was
like
a
forum
or
some
open
for
the
exchange
of
ideas
somewhat
cold
and
draughty
but
light
spacious
and
orderly
a
kind
of
academic
grove
from
which
all
the
leaves
had
fallen
in
this
privileged
area
a
dozen
of
us
were
wont
to
stretch
our
muscles
and
expand
our
lungs
and
as
if
to
prolong
as
much
as
possible
the
tradition
of
what
we
felt
to
be
a
vanishing
institution
one
or
two
neophytes
were
now
and
then
added
to
our
band
young
phil
frenham
was
the
last
and
the
most
interesting
of
these
recruits
and
a
good
example
of
murchard
s
somewhat
morbid
assertion
that
our
old
friend
liked
em
it
was
indeed
a
fact
that
culwin
for
all
his
mental
dryness
specially
tasted
the
lyric
qualities
in
youth
as
he
was
far
too
good
an
epicurean
to
nip
the
flowers
of
soul
which
he
gathered
for
his
garden
his
friendship
was
not
a
disintegrating
influence
on
the
contrary
it
forced
the
young
idea
to
robuster
bloom
and
in
phil
frenham
he
had
a
fine
subject
for
experimentation
the
boy
was
really
intelligent
and
the
soundness
of
his
nature
was
like
the
pure
paste
under
a
delicate
glaze
culwin
had
fished
him
out
of
a
thick
fog
of
family
dulness
and
pulled
him
up
to
a
peak
in
darien
and
the
adventure
hadn
t
hurt
him
a
bit
indeed
the
skill
with
which
culwin
had
contrived
to
stimulate
his
curiosities
without
robbing
them
of
their
young
bloom
of
awe
seemed
to
me
a
sufficient
answer
to
murchard
s
ogreish
metaphor
there
was
nothing
hectic
in
frenham
s
efflorescence
and
his
old
friend
had
not
laid
even
a
on
the
sacred
stupidities
one
wanted
no
better
proof
of
that
than
the
fact
that
frenham
still
reverenced
them
in
culwin
there
s
a
side
of
him
you
fellows
don
t
see
believe
that
story
about
the
duel
he
declared
and
it
was
of
the
very
essence
of
this
belief
that
it
should
impel
him
just
as
our
little
party
was
dispersing
to
turn
back
to
our
host
with
the
absurd
demand
and
now
you
ve
got
to
tell
us
about
ghost
the
outer
door
had
closed
on
murchard
and
the
others
only
frenham
and
i
remained
and
the
vigilant
servant
who
presided
over
culwin
s
destinies
having
brought
a
fresh
supply
of
had
been
laconically
ordered
to
bed
culwin
s
sociability
was
a
flower
and
we
knew
that
he
expected
the
nucleus
of
his
group
to
tighten
around
him
after
midnight
but
frenham
s
appeal
seemed
to
disconcert
him
comically
and
he
rose
from
the
chair
in
which
he
had
just
reseated
himself
after
his
farewells
in
the
hall
ghost
do
you
suppose
i
m
fool
enough
to
go
to
the
expense
of
keeping
one
of
my
own
when
there
are
so
many
charming
ones
in
my
friends
closets
take
another
cigar
he
said
revolving
toward
me
with
a
laugh
frenham
laughed
too
pulling
up
his
slender
height
before
the
as
he
turned
to
face
his
short
bristling
friend
oh
he
said
you
d
never
be
content
to
share
if
you
met
one
you
really
culwin
had
dropped
back
into
his
armchair
his
shock
head
embedded
in
its
habitual
hollow
his
little
eyes
glimmering
over
a
fresh
cigar
liked
good
lord
he
growled
ah
you
then
frenham
pounced
on
him
in
the
same
instant
with
a
sidewise
glance
of
victory
at
me
but
culwin
cowered
gnomelike
among
his
cushions
dissembling
himself
in
a
protective
cloud
of
smoke
what
s
the
use
of
denying
it
you
ve
seen
everything
so
of
course
you
ve
seen
a
ghost
his
young
friend
persisted
talking
intrepidly
into
the
cloud
or
if
you
haven
t
seen
one
it
s
only
because
you
ve
seen
two
the
form
of
the
challenge
seemed
to
strike
our
host
he
shot
his
head
out
of
the
mist
with
a
queer
motion
he
sometimes
had
and
blinked
approvingly
at
frenham
yes
he
suddenly
flung
at
us
on
a
shrill
jerk
of
laughter
it
s
only
because
i
ve
seen
two
the
words
were
so
unexpected
that
they
dropped
down
and
down
into
a
fathomless
silence
while
we
continued
to
stare
at
each
other
over
culwin
s
head
and
culwin
stared
at
his
ghosts
at
length
frenham
without
speaking
threw
himself
into
the
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
and
leaned
forward
with
his
listening
smile
ii
oh
of
course
they
re
not
show
ghosts
a
collector
wouldn
t
think
anything
of
them
don
t
let
me
raise
your
hopes
their
one
merit
is
their
numerical
strength
the
exceptional
fact
of
their
being
but
as
against
this
i
m
bound
to
admit
that
at
any
moment
i
could
probably
have
exorcised
them
both
by
asking
my
doctor
for
a
prescription
or
my
oculist
for
a
pair
of
spectacles
only
as
i
never
could
make
up
my
mind
whether
to
go
to
the
doctor
or
the
oculist
whether
i
was
afflicted
by
an
optical
or
a
digestive
delusion
i
left
them
to
pursue
their
interesting
double
life
though
at
times
they
made
mine
exceedingly
comfortable
yes
uncomfortable
and
you
know
how
i
hate
to
be
uncomfortable
but
it
was
part
of
my
stupid
pride
when
the
thing
began
not
to
admit
that
i
could
be
disturbed
by
the
trifling
matter
of
seeing
two
and
then
i
d
no
reason
really
to
suppose
i
was
as
far
as
i
knew
i
was
simply
bored
horribly
bored
but
it
was
part
of
my
boredom
i
remember
that
i
was
feeling
so
uncommonly
well
and
didn
t
know
how
on
earth
to
work
off
my
surplus
energy
i
had
come
back
from
a
long
journey
down
in
south
america
and
mexico
and
had
settled
down
for
the
winter
near
new
york
with
an
old
aunt
who
had
known
washington
irving
and
corresponded
with
willis
she
lived
not
far
from
irvington
in
a
damp
gothic
villa
overhung
by
norway
spruces
and
looking
exactly
like
a
memorial
emblem
done
in
hair
her
personal
appearance
was
in
keeping
with
this
image
and
her
own
hair
of
which
there
was
little
left
might
have
been
sacrificed
to
the
manufacture
of
the
emblem
i
had
just
reached
the
end
of
an
agitated
year
with
considerable
arrears
to
make
up
in
money
and
emotion
and
theoretically
it
seemed
as
though
my
aunt
s
mild
hospitality
would
be
as
beneficial
to
my
nerves
as
to
my
purse
but
the
deuce
of
it
was
that
as
soon
as
i
felt
myself
safe
and
sheltered
my
energy
began
to
revive
and
how
was
i
to
work
it
off
inside
of
a
memorial
emblem
i
had
at
that
time
the
agreeable
illusion
that
sustained
intellectual
effort
could
engage
a
man
s
whole
activity
and
i
decided
to
write
a
great
book
i
forget
about
what
my
aunt
impressed
by
my
plan
gave
up
to
me
her
gothic
library
filled
with
classics
in
black
cloth
and
daguerrotypes
of
faded
celebrities
and
i
sat
down
at
my
desk
to
make
myself
a
place
among
their
number
and
to
facilitate
my
task
she
lent
me
a
cousin
to
copy
my
manuscript
the
cousin
was
a
nice
girl
and
i
had
an
idea
that
a
nice
girl
was
just
what
i
needed
to
restore
my
faith
in
human
nature
and
principally
in
myself
she
was
neither
beautiful
nor
intelligent
poor
alice
nowell
but
it
interested
me
to
see
any
woman
content
to
be
so
uninteresting
and
i
wanted
to
find
out
the
secret
of
her
content
in
doing
this
i
handled
it
rather
rashly
and
put
it
out
of
joint
oh
just
for
a
moment
there
s
no
fatuity
in
telling
you
this
for
the
poor
girl
had
never
seen
any
one
but
cousins
well
i
was
sorry
for
what
i
d
done
of
course
and
confoundedly
bothered
as
to
how
i
should
put
it
straight
she
was
staying
in
the
house
and
one
evening
after
my
aunt
had
gone
to
bed
she
came
down
to
the
library
to
fetch
a
book
she
d
mislaid
like
any
artless
heroine
on
the
shelves
behind
us
she
was
and
flustered
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
her
hair
though
it
was
fairly
thick
and
pretty
would
look
exactly
like
my
aunt
s
when
she
grew
older
i
was
glad
i
had
noticed
this
for
it
made
it
easier
for
me
to
do
what
was
right
and
when
i
had
found
the
book
she
hadn
t
lost
i
told
her
i
was
leaving
for
europe
that
week
europe
was
terribly
far
off
in
those
days
and
alice
knew
at
once
what
i
meant
she
didn
t
take
it
in
the
least
as
i
d
expected
it
would
have
been
easier
if
she
had
she
held
her
book
very
tight
and
turned
away
a
moment
to
wind
up
the
lamp
on
my
desk
it
had
a
ground
glass
shade
with
vine
leaves
and
glass
drops
around
the
edge
i
remember
then
she
came
back
held
out
her
hand
and
said
and
as
she
said
it
she
looked
straight
at
me
and
kissed
me
i
had
never
felt
anything
as
fresh
and
shy
and
brave
as
her
kiss
it
was
worse
than
any
reproach
and
it
made
me
ashamed
to
deserve
a
reproach
from
her
i
said
to
myself
i
ll
marry
her
and
when
my
aunt
dies
she
ll
leave
us
this
house
and
i
ll
sit
here
at
the
desk
and
go
on
with
my
book
and
alice
will
sit
over
there
with
her
embroidery
and
look
at
me
as
she
s
looking
now
and
life
will
go
on
like
that
for
any
number
of
the
prospect
frightened
me
a
little
but
at
the
time
it
didn
t
frighten
me
as
much
as
doing
anything
to
hurt
her
and
ten
minutes
later
she
had
my
seal
ring
on
my
finger
and
my
promise
that
when
i
went
abroad
she
should
go
with
me
you
ll
wonder
why
i
m
enlarging
on
this
familiar
incident
it
s
because
the
evening
on
which
it
took
place
was
the
very
evening
on
which
i
first
saw
the
queer
sight
i
ve
spoken
of
being
at
that
time
an
ardent
believer
in
a
necessary
sequence
between
cause
and
effect
i
naturally
tried
to
trace
some
kind
of
link
between
what
had
just
happened
to
me
in
my
aunt
s
library
and
what
was
to
happen
a
few
hours
later
on
the
same
night
and
so
the
coincidence
between
the
two
events
always
remained
in
my
mind
i
went
up
to
bed
with
rather
a
heavy
heart
for
i
was
bowed
under
the
weight
of
the
first
good
action
i
had
ever
consciously
committed
and
young
as
i
was
i
saw
the
gravity
of
my
situation
don
t
imagine
from
this
that
i
had
hitherto
been
an
instrument
of
destruction
i
had
been
merely
a
harmless
young
man
who
had
followed
his
bent
and
declined
all
collaboration
with
providence
now
i
had
suddenly
undertaken
to
promote
the
moral
order
of
the
world
and
i
felt
a
good
deal
like
the
trustful
spectator
who
has
given
his
gold
watch
to
the
conjurer
and
doesn
t
know
in
what
shape
he
ll
get
it
back
when
the
trick
is
over
still
a
glow
of
tempered
my
fears
and
i
said
to
myself
as
i
undressed
that
when
i
d
got
used
to
being
good
it
probably
wouldn
t
make
me
as
nervous
as
it
did
at
the
start
and
by
the
time
i
was
in
bed
and
had
blown
out
my
candle
i
felt
that
i
really
getting
used
to
it
and
that
as
far
as
i
d
got
it
was
not
unlike
sinking
down
into
one
of
my
aunt
s
very
softest
wool
mattresses
i
closed
my
eyes
on
this
image
and
when
i
opened
them
it
must
have
been
a
good
deal
later
for
my
room
had
grown
cold
and
the
night
was
intensely
still
i
was
waked
suddenly
by
the
feeling
we
all
know
the
feeling
that
there
was
something
near
me
that
hadn
t
been
there
when
i
fell
asleep
i
sat
up
and
strained
my
eyes
into
the
darkness
the
room
was
pitch
black
and
at
first
i
saw
nothing
but
gradually
a
vague
glimmer
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
turned
into
two
eyes
staring
back
at
me
i
couldn
t
see
the
face
attached
to
them
on
account
of
the
darkness
i
imagined
but
as
i
looked
the
eyes
grew
more
and
more
distinct
they
gave
out
a
light
of
their
own
the
sensation
of
being
thus
gazed
at
was
far
from
pleasant
and
you
might
suppose
that
my
first
impulse
would
have
been
to
jump
out
of
bed
and
hurl
myself
on
the
invisible
figure
attached
to
the
eyes
but
it
wasn
t
my
impulse
was
simply
to
lie
still
i
can
t
say
whether
this
was
due
to
an
immediate
sense
of
the
uncanny
nature
of
the
apparition
to
the
certainty
that
if
i
did
jump
out
of
bed
i
should
hurl
myself
on
nothing
or
merely
to
the
benumbing
effect
of
the
eyes
themselves
they
were
the
very
worst
eyes
i
ve
ever
seen
a
man
s
eyes
but
what
a
man
my
first
thought
was
that
he
must
be
frightfully
old
the
orbits
were
sunk
and
the
thick
lids
hung
over
the
eyeballs
like
blinds
of
which
the
cords
are
broken
one
lid
drooped
a
little
lower
than
the
other
with
the
effect
of
a
crooked
leer
and
between
these
pulpy
folds
of
flesh
with
their
scant
bristle
of
lashes
the
eyes
themselves
small
glassy
disks
with
an
rim
about
the
pupils
looked
like
in
the
grip
of
a
starfish
but
the
age
of
the
eyes
was
not
the
most
unpleasant
thing
about
them
what
turned
me
sick
was
their
expression
of
vicious
security
i
don
t
know
how
else
to
describe
the
fact
that
they
seemed
to
belong
to
a
man
who
had
done
a
lot
of
harm
in
his
life
but
had
always
kept
just
inside
the
danger
lines
they
were
not
the
eyes
of
a
coward
but
of
some
one
much
too
clever
to
take
risks
and
my
gorge
rose
at
their
look
of
base
astuteness
yet
even
that
wasn
t
the
worst
for
as
we
continued
to
scan
each
other
i
saw
in
them
a
tinge
of
faint
derision
and
felt
myself
to
be
its
object
at
that
i
was
seized
by
an
impulse
of
rage
that
jerked
me
out
of
bed
and
pitched
me
straight
on
the
unseen
figure
at
its
foot
but
of
course
there
wasn
t
any
figure
there
and
my
fists
struck
at
emptiness
ashamed
and
cold
i
groped
about
for
a
match
and
lit
the
candles
the
room
looked
just
as
usual
as
i
had
known
it
would
and
i
crawled
back
to
bed
and
blew
out
the
lights
as
soon
as
the
room
was
dark
again
the
eyes
reappeared
and
i
now
applied
myself
to
explaining
them
on
scientific
principles
at
first
i
thought
the
illusion
might
have
been
caused
by
the
glow
of
the
last
embers
in
the
chimney
but
the
was
on
the
other
side
of
my
bed
and
so
placed
that
the
fire
could
not
possibly
be
reflected
in
my
toilet
glass
which
was
the
only
mirror
in
the
room
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
have
been
tricked
by
the
reflection
of
the
embers
in
some
polished
bit
of
wood
or
metal
and
though
i
couldn
t
discover
any
object
of
the
sort
in
my
line
of
vision
i
got
up
again
groped
my
way
to
the
hearth
and
covered
what
was
left
of
the
fire
but
as
soon
as
i
was
back
in
bed
the
eyes
were
back
at
its
foot
they
were
an
hallucination
then
that
was
plain
but
the
fact
that
they
were
not
due
to
any
external
dupery
didn
t
make
them
a
bit
pleasanter
to
see
for
if
they
were
a
projection
of
my
inner
consciousness
what
the
deuce
was
the
matter
with
that
organ
i
had
gone
deeply
enough
into
the
mystery
of
morbid
pathological
states
to
picture
the
conditions
under
which
an
exploring
mind
might
lay
itself
open
to
such
a
midnight
admonition
but
i
couldn
t
fit
it
to
my
present
case
i
had
never
felt
more
normal
mentally
and
physically
and
the
only
unusual
fact
in
my
situation
that
of
having
assured
the
happiness
of
an
amiable
girl
did
not
seem
of
a
kind
to
summon
unclean
spirits
about
my
pillow
but
there
were
the
eyes
still
looking
at
me
i
shut
mine
and
tried
to
evoke
a
vision
of
alice
nowell
s
they
were
not
remarkable
eyes
but
they
were
as
wholesome
as
fresh
water
and
if
she
had
had
more
imagination
or
longer
lashes
their
expression
might
have
been
interesting
as
it
was
they
did
not
prove
very
efficacious
and
in
a
few
moments
i
perceived
that
they
had
mysteriously
changed
into
the
eyes
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
it
exasperated
me
more
to
feel
these
glaring
at
me
through
my
shut
lids
than
to
see
them
and
i
opened
my
eyes
again
and
looked
straight
into
their
hateful
stare
and
so
it
went
on
all
night
i
can
t
tell
you
what
that
night
was
nor
how
long
it
lasted
have
you
ever
lain
in
bed
hopelessly
wide
awake
and
tried
to
keep
your
eyes
shut
knowing
that
if
you
opened
em
you
d
see
something
you
dreaded
and
loathed
it
sounds
easy
but
it
s
devilish
hard
those
eyes
hung
there
and
drew
me
i
had
the
de
l
and
their
red
lids
were
the
edge
of
my
abyss
i
had
known
nervous
hours
before
hours
when
i
d
felt
the
wind
of
danger
in
my
neck
but
never
this
kind
of
strain
it
wasn
t
that
the
eyes
were
so
awful
they
hadn
t
the
majesty
of
the
powers
of
darkness
but
they
had
how
shall
i
say
a
physical
effect
that
was
the
equivalent
of
a
bad
smell
their
look
left
a
smear
like
a
snail
s
and
i
didn
t
see
what
business
they
had
with
me
anyhow
and
i
stared
and
stared
trying
to
find
out
i
don
t
know
what
effect
they
were
trying
to
produce
but
the
effect
they
produce
was
that
of
making
me
pack
my
portmanteau
and
bolt
to
town
early
the
next
morning
i
left
a
note
for
my
aunt
explaining
that
i
was
ill
and
had
gone
to
see
my
doctor
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
feel
uncommonly
ill
the
night
seemed
to
have
pumped
all
the
blood
out
of
me
but
when
i
reached
town
i
didn
t
go
to
the
doctor
s
i
went
to
a
friend
s
rooms
and
threw
myself
on
a
bed
and
slept
for
ten
heavenly
hours
when
i
woke
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
and
i
turned
cold
at
the
thought
of
what
might
be
waiting
for
me
i
sat
up
shaking
and
stared
into
the
darkness
but
there
wasn
t
a
break
in
its
blessed
surface
and
when
i
saw
that
the
eyes
were
not
there
i
dropped
back
into
another
long
sleep
i
had
left
no
word
for
alice
when
i
fled
because
i
meant
to
go
back
the
next
morning
but
the
next
morning
i
was
too
exhausted
to
stir
as
the
day
went
on
the
exhaustion
increased
instead
of
wearing
off
like
the
lassitude
left
by
an
ordinary
night
of
insomnia
the
effect
of
the
eyes
seemed
to
be
cumulative
and
the
thought
of
seeing
them
again
grew
intolerable
for
two
days
i
struggled
with
my
dread
but
on
the
third
evening
i
pulled
myself
together
and
decided
to
go
back
the
next
morning
i
felt
a
good
deal
happier
as
soon
as
i
d
decided
for
i
knew
that
my
abrupt
disappearance
and
the
strangeness
of
my
not
writing
must
have
been
very
painful
for
poor
alice
that
night
i
went
to
bed
with
an
easy
mind
and
fell
asleep
at
once
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
woke
and
there
were
the
eyes
well
i
simply
couldn
t
face
them
and
instead
of
going
back
to
my
aunt
s
i
bundled
a
few
things
into
a
trunk
and
jumped
onto
the
first
steamer
for
england
i
was
so
dead
tired
when
i
got
on
board
that
i
crawled
straight
into
my
berth
and
slept
most
of
the
way
over
and
i
can
t
tell
you
the
bliss
it
was
to
wake
from
those
long
stretches
of
dreamless
sleep
and
look
fearlessly
into
the
darkness
that
i
shouldn
t
see
the
eyes
i
stayed
abroad
for
a
year
and
then
i
stayed
for
another
and
during
that
time
i
never
had
a
glimpse
of
them
that
was
enough
reason
for
prolonging
my
stay
if
i
d
been
on
a
desert
island
another
was
of
course
that
i
had
perfectly
come
to
see
on
the
voyage
over
the
folly
complete
impossibility
of
my
marrying
alice
nowell
the
fact
that
i
had
been
so
slow
in
making
this
discovery
annoyed
me
and
made
me
want
to
avoid
explanations
the
bliss
of
escaping
at
one
stroke
from
the
eyes
and
from
this
other
embarrassment
gave
my
freedom
an
extraordinary
zest
and
the
longer
i
savoured
it
the
better
i
liked
its
taste
the
eyes
had
burned
such
a
hole
in
my
consciousness
that
for
a
long
time
i
went
on
puzzling
over
the
nature
of
the
apparition
and
wondering
nervously
if
it
would
ever
come
back
but
as
time
passed
i
lost
this
dread
and
retained
only
the
precision
of
the
image
then
that
faded
in
its
turn
the
second
year
found
me
settled
in
rome
where
i
was
planning
i
believe
to
write
another
great
book
a
definitive
work
on
etruscan
influences
in
italian
art
at
any
rate
i
d
found
some
pretext
of
the
kind
for
taking
a
sunny
apartment
in
the
piazza
di
spagna
and
dabbling
about
indefinitely
in
the
forum
and
there
one
morning
a
charming
youth
came
to
me
as
he
stood
there
in
the
warm
light
slender
and
smooth
and
hyacinthine
he
might
have
stepped
from
a
ruined
altar
one
to
antinous
say
but
he
d
come
instead
from
new
york
with
a
letter
of
all
people
from
alice
nowell
the
letter
the
first
i
d
had
from
her
since
our
break
was
simply
a
line
introducing
her
young
cousin
gilbert
noyes
and
appealing
to
me
to
befriend
him
it
appeared
poor
lad
that
he
had
talent
and
wanted
to
write
and
an
obdurate
family
having
insisted
that
his
calligraphy
should
take
the
form
of
double
entry
alice
had
intervened
to
win
him
six
months
respite
during
which
he
was
to
travel
on
a
meagre
pittance
and
somehow
prove
his
ultimate
ability
to
increase
it
by
his
pen
the
quaint
conditions
of
the
test
struck
me
first
it
seemed
about
as
conclusive
as
a
mediaeval
then
i
was
touched
by
her
having
sent
him
to
me
i
had
always
wanted
to
do
her
some
service
to
justify
myself
in
my
own
eyes
rather
than
hers
and
here
was
a
beautiful
embodiment
of
my
chance
well
i
imagine
it
s
safe
to
lay
down
the
general
principle
that
predestined
geniuses
don
t
as
a
rule
appear
before
one
in
the
spring
sunshine
of
the
forum
looking
like
one
of
its
banished
gods
at
any
rate
poor
noyes
wasn
t
a
predestined
genius
but
he
beautiful
to
see
and
charming
as
a
comrade
too
it
was
only
when
he
began
to
talk
literature
that
my
heart
failed
me
i
knew
all
the
symptoms
so
well
the
things
he
had
in
him
and
the
things
outside
him
that
impinged
there
s
the
real
test
after
all
it
was
always
punctually
inevitably
with
the
inexorableness
of
a
mechanical
law
it
was
the
wrong
thing
that
struck
him
i
grew
to
find
a
certain
grim
fascination
in
deciding
in
advance
exactly
which
wrong
thing
he
d
select
and
i
acquired
an
astonishing
skill
at
the
game
the
worst
of
it
was
that
his
wasn
t
of
the
too
obvious
sort
ladies
who
met
him
at
picnics
thought
him
intellectual
and
even
at
dinners
he
passed
for
clever
i
who
had
him
under
the
microscope
fancied
now
and
then
that
he
might
develop
some
kind
of
a
slim
talent
something
that
he
could
make
do
and
be
happy
on
and
wasn
t
that
after
all
what
i
was
concerned
with
he
was
so
charming
he
continued
to
be
so
charming
that
he
called
forth
all
my
charity
in
support
of
this
argument
and
for
the
first
few
months
i
really
believed
there
was
a
chance
for
him
those
months
were
delightful
noyes
was
constantly
with
me
and
the
more
i
saw
of
him
the
better
i
liked
him
his
stupidity
was
a
natural
grace
it
was
as
beautiful
really
as
his
and
he
was
so
gay
so
affectionate
and
so
happy
with
me
that
telling
him
the
truth
would
have
been
about
as
pleasant
as
slitting
the
throat
of
some
artless
animal
at
first
i
used
to
wonder
what
had
put
into
that
radiant
head
the
detestable
delusion
that
it
held
a
brain
then
i
began
to
see
that
it
was
simply
protective
mimicry
an
instinctive
ruse
to
get
away
from
family
life
and
an
office
desk
not
that
gilbert
didn
t
dear
lad
believe
in
himself
there
wasn
t
a
trace
of
hypocrisy
in
his
composition
he
was
sure
that
his
call
was
irresistible
while
to
me
it
was
the
saving
grace
of
his
situation
that
it
and
that
a
little
money
a
little
leisure
a
little
pleasure
would
have
turned
him
into
an
inoffensive
idler
unluckily
however
there
was
no
hope
of
money
and
with
the
grim
alternative
of
the
office
desk
before
him
he
couldn
t
postpone
his
attempt
at
literature
the
stuff
he
turned
out
was
deplorable
and
i
see
now
that
i
knew
it
from
the
first
still
the
absurdity
of
deciding
a
man
s
whole
future
on
a
first
trial
seemed
to
justify
me
in
withholding
my
verdict
and
perhaps
even
in
encouraging
him
a
little
on
the
ground
that
the
human
plant
generally
needs
warmth
to
flower
at
any
rate
i
proceeded
on
that
principle
and
carried
it
to
the
point
of
getting
his
term
of
probation
extended
when
i
left
rome
he
went
with
me
and
we
idled
away
a
delicious
summer
between
capri
and
venice
i
said
to
myself
if
he
has
anything
in
him
it
will
come
out
now
and
it
he
was
never
more
enchanting
and
enchanted
there
were
moments
of
our
pilgrimage
when
beauty
born
of
murmuring
sound
seemed
actually
to
pass
into
his
face
but
only
to
issue
forth
in
a
shallow
flood
of
the
palest
ink
well
the
time
came
to
turn
off
the
tap
and
i
knew
there
was
no
hand
but
mine
to
do
it
we
were
back
in
rome
and
i
had
taken
him
to
stay
with
me
not
wanting
him
to
be
alone
in
his
dismal
when
he
had
to
face
the
necessity
of
renouncing
his
ambition
i
hadn
t
of
course
relied
solely
on
my
own
judgment
in
deciding
to
advise
him
to
drop
literature
i
had
sent
his
stuff
to
various
people
editors
and
critics
and
they
had
always
sent
it
back
with
the
same
chilling
lack
of
comment
really
there
was
nothing
on
earth
to
say
about
it
i
confess
i
never
felt
more
shabbily
than
i
did
on
the
day
when
i
decided
to
have
it
out
with
gilbert
it
was
well
enough
to
tell
myself
that
it
was
my
duty
to
knock
the
poor
boy
s
hopes
into
splinters
but
i
d
like
to
know
what
act
of
gratuitous
cruelty
hasn
t
been
justified
on
that
plea
i
ve
always
shrunk
from
usurping
the
functions
of
providence
and
when
i
have
to
exercise
them
i
decidedly
prefer
that
it
shouldn
t
be
on
an
errand
of
destruction
besides
in
the
last
issue
who
was
i
to
decide
even
after
a
year
s
trial
if
poor
gilbert
had
it
in
him
or
not
the
more
i
looked
at
the
part
i
d
resolved
to
play
the
less
i
liked
it
and
i
liked
it
still
less
when
gilbert
sat
opposite
me
with
his
head
thrown
back
in
the
lamplight
just
as
phil
s
is
now
i
d
been
going
over
his
last
manuscript
and
he
knew
it
and
he
knew
that
his
future
hung
on
my
verdict
we
d
tacitly
agreed
to
that
the
manuscript
lay
between
us
on
my
table
a
novel
his
first
novel
if
you
please
and
he
reached
over
and
laid
his
hand
on
it
and
looked
up
at
me
with
all
his
life
in
the
look
i
stood
up
and
cleared
my
throat
trying
to
keep
my
eyes
away
from
his
face
and
on
the
manuscript
the
fact
is
my
dear
gilbert
i
began
i
saw
him
turn
pale
but
he
was
up
and
facing
me
in
an
instant
oh
look
here
don
t
take
on
so
my
dear
fellow
i
m
not
so
awfully
cut
up
as
all
that
his
hands
were
on
my
shoulders
and
he
was
laughing
down
on
me
from
his
full
height
with
a
kind
of
gaiety
that
drove
the
knife
into
my
side
he
was
too
beautifully
brave
for
me
to
keep
up
any
humbug
about
my
duty
and
it
came
over
me
suddenly
how
i
should
hurt
others
in
hurting
him
myself
first
since
sending
him
home
meant
losing
him
but
more
particularly
poor
alice
nowell
to
whom
i
had
so
uneasily
longed
to
prove
my
good
faith
and
my
immense
desire
to
serve
her
it
really
seemed
like
failing
her
twice
to
fail
gilbert
but
my
intuition
was
like
one
of
those
lightning
flashes
that
encircle
the
whole
horizon
and
in
the
same
instant
i
saw
what
i
might
be
letting
myself
in
for
if
i
didn
t
tell
the
truth
i
said
to
myself
i
shall
have
him
for
life
and
i
d
never
yet
seen
any
one
man
or
woman
whom
i
was
quite
sure
of
wanting
on
those
terms
well
this
impulse
of
egotism
decided
me
i
was
ashamed
of
it
and
to
get
away
from
it
i
took
a
leap
that
landed
me
straight
in
gilbert
s
arms
the
thing
s
all
right
and
you
re
all
wrong
i
shouted
up
at
him
and
as
he
hugged
me
and
i
laughed
and
shook
in
his
incredulous
clutch
i
had
for
a
minute
the
sense
of
that
is
supposed
to
attend
the
footsteps
of
the
just
hang
it
all
making
people
happy
its
charms
gilbert
of
course
was
for
celebrating
his
emancipation
in
some
spectacular
manner
but
i
sent
him
away
alone
to
explode
his
emotions
and
went
to
bed
to
sleep
off
mine
as
i
undressed
i
began
to
wonder
what
their
would
be
so
many
of
the
finest
don
t
keep
still
i
wasn
t
sorry
and
i
meant
to
empty
the
bottle
even
if
it
turn
a
trifle
flat
after
i
got
into
bed
i
lay
for
a
long
time
smiling
at
the
memory
of
his
eyes
his
blissful
eyes
then
i
fell
asleep
and
when
i
woke
the
room
was
deathly
cold
and
i
sat
up
with
a
jerk
and
there
were
other
it
was
three
years
since
i
d
seen
them
but
i
d
thought
of
them
so
often
that
i
fancied
they
could
never
take
me
unawares
again
now
with
their
red
sneer
on
me
i
knew
that
i
had
never
really
believed
they
would
come
back
and
that
i
was
as
defenceless
as
ever
against
them
as
before
it
was
the
insane
irrelevance
of
their
coming
that
made
it
so
horrible
what
the
deuce
were
they
after
to
leap
out
at
me
at
such
a
time
i
had
lived
more
or
less
carelessly
in
the
years
since
i
d
seen
them
though
my
worst
indiscretions
were
not
dark
enough
to
invite
the
searchings
of
their
infernal
glare
but
at
this
particular
moment
i
was
really
in
what
might
have
been
called
a
state
of
grace
and
i
can
t
tell
you
how
the
fact
added
to
their
horror
but
it
s
not
enough
to
say
they
were
as
bad
as
before
they
were
worse
worse
by
just
so
much
as
i
d
learned
of
life
in
the
interval
by
all
the
damnable
implications
my
wider
experience
read
into
them
i
saw
now
what
i
hadn
t
seen
before
that
they
were
eyes
which
had
grown
hideous
gradually
which
had
built
up
their
baseness
bit
by
bit
out
of
a
series
of
small
turpitudes
slowly
accumulated
through
the
industrious
years
yes
it
came
to
me
that
what
made
them
so
bad
was
that
they
d
grown
bad
so
slowly
there
they
hung
in
the
darkness
their
swollen
lids
dropped
across
the
little
watery
bulbs
rolling
loose
in
the
orbits
and
the
puff
of
fat
flesh
making
a
muddy
shadow
underneath
and
as
their
filmy
stare
moved
with
my
movements
there
came
over
me
a
sense
of
their
tacit
complicity
of
a
deep
hidden
understanding
between
us
that
was
worse
than
the
first
shock
of
their
strangeness
not
that
i
understood
them
but
that
they
made
it
so
clear
that
some
day
i
should
yes
that
was
the
worst
part
of
it
decidedly
and
it
was
the
feeling
that
became
stronger
each
time
they
came
back
to
me
for
they
got
into
the
damnable
habit
of
coming
back
they
reminded
me
of
vampires
with
a
taste
for
young
flesh
they
seemed
so
to
gloat
over
the
taste
of
a
good
conscience
every
night
for
a
month
they
came
to
claim
their
morsel
of
mine
since
i
d
made
gilbert
happy
they
simply
wouldn
t
loosen
their
fangs
the
coincidence
almost
made
me
hate
him
poor
lad
fortuitous
as
i
felt
it
to
be
i
puzzled
over
it
a
good
deal
but
couldn
t
find
any
hint
of
an
explanation
except
in
the
chance
of
his
association
with
alice
nowell
but
then
the
eyes
had
let
up
on
me
the
moment
i
had
abandoned
her
so
they
could
hardly
be
the
emissaries
of
a
woman
scorned
even
if
one
could
have
pictured
poor
alice
charging
such
spirits
to
avenge
her
that
set
me
thinking
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
they
would
let
up
on
me
if
i
abandoned
gilbert
the
temptation
was
insidious
and
i
had
to
stiffen
myself
against
it
but
really
dear
boy
he
was
too
charming
to
be
sacrificed
to
such
demons
and
so
after
all
i
never
found
out
what
they
wanted
iii
the
fire
crumbled
sending
up
a
flash
which
threw
into
relief
the
narrator
s
gnarled
red
face
under
its
stubble
pressed
into
the
hollow
of
the
dark
leather
armchair
it
stood
out
an
instant
like
an
intaglio
of
yellowish
stone
with
spots
of
enamel
for
the
eyes
then
the
fire
sank
and
in
the
shaded
it
became
once
more
a
dim
rembrandtish
blur
phil
frenham
sitting
in
a
low
chair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
one
long
arm
propped
on
the
table
behind
him
one
hand
supporting
his
head
and
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
his
old
friend
s
face
had
not
moved
since
the
tale
began
he
continued
to
maintain
his
silent
immobility
after
culwin
had
ceased
to
speak
and
it
was
i
who
with
a
vague
sense
of
disappointment
at
the
sudden
drop
of
the
story
finally
asked
but
how
long
did
you
keep
on
seeing
them
culwin
so
sunk
into
his
chair
that
he
seemed
like
a
heap
of
his
own
empty
clothes
stirred
a
little
as
if
in
surprise
at
my
question
he
appeared
to
have
what
he
had
been
telling
us
how
long
oh
off
and
on
all
that
winter
it
was
infernal
i
never
got
used
to
them
i
grew
really
frenham
shifted
his
attitude
silently
and
as
he
did
so
his
elbow
struck
against
a
small
mirror
in
a
bronze
frame
standing
on
the
table
behind
him
he
turned
and
changed
its
angle
slightly
then
he
resumed
his
former
attitude
his
dark
head
thrown
back
on
his
lifted
palm
his
eyes
intent
on
culwin
s
face
something
in
his
stare
embarrassed
me
and
as
if
to
divert
attention
from
it
i
pressed
on
with
another
question
and
you
never
tried
sacrificing
noyes
oh
no
the
fact
is
i
didn
t
have
to
he
did
it
for
me
poor
infatuated
boy
did
it
for
you
how
do
you
mean
he
wore
me
out
wore
everybody
out
he
kept
on
pouring
out
his
lamentable
twaddle
and
hawking
it
up
and
down
the
place
till
he
became
a
thing
of
terror
i
tried
to
wean
him
from
writing
oh
ever
so
gently
you
understand
by
throwing
him
with
agreeable
people
giving
him
a
chance
to
make
himself
felt
to
come
to
a
sense
of
what
he
had
to
give
i
d
foreseen
this
solution
from
the
beginning
felt
sure
that
once
the
first
ardour
of
authorship
was
quenched
he
d
drop
into
his
place
as
a
charming
parasitic
thing
the
kind
of
chronic
cherubino
for
whom
in
old
societies
there
s
always
a
seat
at
table
and
a
shelter
behind
the
ladies
skirts
i
saw
him
take
his
place
as
the
poet
the
poet
who
doesn
t
write
one
knows
the
type
in
every
living
in
that
way
doesn
t
cost
much
i
d
worked
it
all
out
in
my
mind
and
felt
sure
that
with
a
little
help
he
could
manage
it
for
the
next
few
years
and
meanwhile
he
d
be
sure
to
marry
i
saw
him
married
to
a
widow
rather
older
with
a
good
cook
and
a
house
and
i
actually
had
my
eye
on
the
widow
meanwhile
i
did
everything
to
facilitate
the
transition
lent
him
money
to
ease
his
conscience
introduced
him
to
pretty
women
to
make
him
forget
his
vows
but
nothing
would
do
him
he
had
but
one
idea
in
his
beautiful
obstinate
head
he
wanted
the
laurel
and
not
the
rose
and
he
kept
on
repeating
gautier
s
axiom
and
battering
and
filing
at
his
limp
prose
till
he
d
spread
it
out
over
lord
knows
how
many
thousand
sloppy
pages
now
and
then
he
would
send
a
pailful
to
a
publisher
and
of
course
it
would
always
come
back
at
first
it
didn
t
matter
he
thought
he
was
he
took
the
attitudes
of
genius
and
whenever
an
opus
came
home
he
wrote
another
to
keep
it
company
then
he
had
a
reaction
of
despair
and
accused
me
of
deceiving
him
and
lord
knows
what
i
got
angry
at
that
and
told
him
it
was
he
who
had
deceived
himself
he
d
come
to
me
determined
to
write
and
i
d
done
my
best
to
help
him
that
was
the
extent
of
my
offence
and
i
d
done
it
for
his
cousin
s
sake
not
his
that
seemed
to
strike
home
and
he
didn
t
answer
for
a
minute
then
he
said
my
time
s
up
and
my
money
s
up
what
do
you
think
i
d
better
do
i
think
you
d
better
not
be
an
ass
i
said
he
turned
red
and
asked
what
do
you
mean
by
being
an
ass
i
took
a
letter
from
my
desk
and
held
it
out
to
him
i
mean
refusing
this
offer
of
ellinger
s
to
be
her
secretary
at
a
salary
of
five
thousand
dollars
there
may
be
a
lot
more
in
it
than
he
flung
out
his
hand
with
a
violence
that
struck
the
letter
from
mine
oh
i
know
well
enough
what
s
in
it
he
said
scarlet
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
what
s
your
answer
if
you
know
i
asked
he
made
none
at
the
minute
but
turned
away
slowly
to
the
door
there
with
his
hand
on
the
threshold
he
stopped
to
ask
almost
under
his
breath
then
you
really
think
my
stuff
s
no
good
i
was
tired
and
exasperated
and
i
laughed
i
don
t
defend
my
laugh
it
was
in
wretched
taste
but
i
must
plead
in
extenuation
that
the
boy
was
a
fool
and
that
i
d
done
my
best
for
him
i
really
had
he
went
out
of
the
room
shutting
the
door
quietly
after
him
that
afternoon
i
left
for
frascati
where
i
d
promised
to
spend
the
sunday
with
some
friends
i
was
glad
to
escape
from
gilbert
and
by
the
same
token
as
i
learned
that
night
i
had
also
escaped
from
the
eyes
i
dropped
into
the
same
lethargic
sleep
that
had
come
to
me
before
when
their
visitations
ceased
and
when
i
woke
the
next
morning
in
my
peaceful
painted
room
above
the
ilexes
i
felt
the
utter
weariness
and
deep
relief
that
always
followed
on
that
repairing
slumber
i
put
in
two
blessed
nights
at
frascati
and
when
i
got
back
to
my
rooms
in
rome
i
found
that
gilbert
had
gone
oh
nothing
tragic
had
happened
the
episode
never
rose
to
he
d
simply
packed
his
manuscripts
and
left
for
america
for
his
family
and
the
wall
street
desk
he
left
a
decent
little
note
to
tell
me
of
his
decision
and
behaved
altogether
in
the
circumstances
as
little
like
a
fool
as
it
s
possible
for
a
fool
to
behave
iv
culwin
paused
again
and
again
frenham
sat
motionless
the
dusky
contour
of
his
young
head
reflected
in
the
mirror
at
his
back
and
what
became
of
noyes
afterward
i
finally
asked
still
disquieted
by
a
sense
of
incompleteness
by
the
need
of
some
connecting
thread
between
the
parallel
lines
of
the
tale
culwin
twitched
his
shoulders
oh
nothing
became
of
him
because
he
became
nothing
there
could
be
no
question
of
becoming
about
it
he
vegetated
in
an
office
i
believe
and
finally
got
a
clerkship
in
a
consulate
and
married
drearily
in
china
i
saw
him
once
in
hong
kong
years
afterward
he
was
fat
and
hadn
t
shaved
i
was
told
he
drank
he
didn
t
recognize
and
the
eyes
i
asked
after
another
pause
which
frenham
s
continued
silence
made
oppressive
culwin
stroking
his
chin
blinked
at
me
meditatively
through
the
shadows
i
never
saw
them
after
my
last
talk
with
gilbert
put
two
and
two
together
if
you
can
for
my
part
i
haven
t
found
the
he
rose
stiffly
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
walked
over
to
the
table
on
which
reviving
drinks
had
been
set
out
you
must
be
parched
after
this
dry
tale
here
help
yourself
my
dear
fellow
here
phil
he
turned
back
to
the
hearth
frenham
still
sat
in
his
low
chair
making
no
response
to
his
host
s
hospitable
summons
but
as
culwin
advanced
toward
him
their
eyes
met
in
a
long
look
after
which
to
my
intense
surprise
the
young
man
turning
suddenly
in
his
seat
flung
his
arms
across
the
table
and
dropped
his
face
upon
them
culwin
at
the
unexpected
gesture
stopped
short
a
flush
on
his
face
phil
what
the
deuce
why
have
the
eyes
scared
my
dear
boy
my
dear
fellow
i
never
had
such
a
tribute
to
my
literary
ability
never
he
broke
into
a
chuckle
at
the
thought
and
halted
on
the
his
hands
still
in
his
pockets
gazing
down
in
honest
perplexity
at
the
youth
s
bowed
head
then
as
frenham
still
made
no
answer
he
moved
a
step
or
two
nearer
cheer
up
my
dear
phil
it
s
years
since
i
ve
seen
them
apparently
i
ve
done
nothing
lately
bad
enough
to
call
them
out
of
chaos
unless
my
present
evocation
of
them
has
made
see
them
which
would
be
their
worst
stroke
yet
his
bantering
appeal
quivered
off
into
an
uneasy
laugh
and
he
moved
still
nearer
bending
over
frenham
and
laying
his
gouty
hands
on
the
lad
s
shoulders
phil
my
dear
boy
really
what
s
the
matter
why
don
t
you
answer
you
seen
the
eyes
frenham
s
face
was
still
pressed
against
his
arms
and
from
where
i
stood
behind
culwin
i
saw
the
latter
as
if
under
the
rebuff
of
this
unaccountable
attitude
draw
back
slowly
from
his
friend
as
he
did
so
the
light
of
the
lamp
on
the
table
fell
full
on
his
perplexed
congested
face
and
i
caught
its
sudden
reflection
in
the
mirror
behind
frenham
s
head
culwin
saw
the
reflection
also
he
paused
his
face
level
with
the
mirror
as
if
scarcely
recognizing
the
countenance
in
it
as
his
own
but
as
he
looked
his
expression
gradually
changed
and
for
an
appreciable
space
of
time
he
and
the
image
in
the
glass
confronted
each
other
with
a
glare
of
slowly
gathering
hate
then
culwin
let
go
of
frenham
s
shoulders
and
drew
back
a
step
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
frenham
his
face
still
hidden
did
not
stir
the
blond
beast
i
it
had
been
almost
too
easy
that
was
young
millner
s
first
feeling
as
he
stood
again
on
the
spence
the
great
moment
of
his
interview
behind
him
and
fifth
avenue
rolling
its
grimy
pactolus
at
his
feet
halting
there
in
the
winter
light
with
the
clang
of
the
ponderous
vestibule
doors
in
his
ears
and
his
eyes
carried
down
the
perspective
of
the
packed
interminable
thoroughfare
he
even
dared
to
remember
rastignac
s
apostrophe
to
paris
and
to
hazard
recklessly
under
his
small
fair
moustache
who
knows
he
hugh
millner
at
any
rate
knew
a
good
deal
already
a
good
deal
more
than
he
had
imagined
it
possible
to
learn
in
half
an
hour
s
talk
with
a
man
like
orlando
spence
and
the
city
spread
out
there
before
him
seemed
to
grin
like
an
accomplice
who
knew
the
rest
a
gust
of
wind
whirling
down
from
the
dizzy
height
of
the
building
on
the
next
corner
drove
sharply
through
his
overcoat
and
compelled
him
to
clutch
at
his
hat
it
was
a
bitter
january
day
a
day
of
fierce
light
and
air
when
the
sunshine
cut
like
icicles
and
the
wind
sucked
one
into
black
gulfs
at
the
street
corners
but
millner
s
complacency
was
like
a
warm
lining
to
his
shabby
coat
and
heaving
steadied
his
hat
he
continued
to
stand
on
the
spence
threshold
lost
in
the
vision
revealed
to
him
from
the
pisgah
of
its
marble
steps
yes
it
was
wonderful
what
the
vision
showed
him
in
his
absorption
he
might
have
frozen
fast
to
the
if
the
rhadamanthine
portals
behind
him
had
not
suddenly
opened
to
let
out
a
slim
figure
the
figure
as
he
perceived
of
the
youth
whom
he
had
caught
in
the
act
of
withdrawal
as
he
entered
spence
s
study
and
whom
the
latter
with
a
wave
of
his
affable
hand
had
detained
to
introduce
as
my
son
it
was
characteristic
of
the
odd
friendliness
of
the
whole
scene
that
the
great
man
should
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
call
back
and
name
his
heir
to
a
mere
humble
applicant
like
millner
and
that
the
heir
should
shed
on
him
from
a
pale
face
a
smile
of
such
deprecating
kindness
it
was
characteristic
equally
of
millner
that
he
should
at
once
mark
the
narrowness
of
the
shoulders
sustaining
this
ingenuous
head
a
narrowness
as
he
now
observed
imperfectly
concealed
by
the
wide
fur
collar
of
young
spence
s
expensive
and
badly
cut
coat
but
the
face
took
on
as
the
youth
smiled
his
surprise
at
their
second
meeting
a
look
of
almost
plaintive
the
kind
of
look
that
millner
scorned
and
yet
could
never
quite
resist
mr
millner
are
you
er
waiting
the
lad
asked
with
an
intention
of
serviceableness
that
was
like
a
finer
echo
of
his
father
s
resounding
cordiality
for
my
motor
no
millner
jested
in
his
frank
free
voice
the
fact
is
i
was
just
standing
here
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
my
luck
and
as
his
companion
s
pale
blue
eyes
seemed
to
shape
a
question
my
extraordinary
luck
he
explained
in
having
been
engaged
as
your
father
s
oh
the
other
rejoined
with
a
faint
colour
in
his
sallow
cheek
i
m
so
glad
he
murmured
but
i
was
sure
he
stopped
and
the
two
looked
kindly
at
each
other
millner
averted
his
gaze
first
almost
fearful
of
its
betraying
the
added
sense
of
his
own
strength
and
dexterity
which
he
drew
from
the
contrast
of
the
other
s
frailness
sure
how
could
any
one
be
sure
i
don
t
believe
in
it
yet
he
laughed
out
in
the
irony
of
his
triumph
the
boy
s
words
did
not
sound
like
a
mere
civility
millner
felt
in
them
an
homage
to
his
power
oh
yes
i
was
sure
young
draper
repeated
sure
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
i
millner
tingled
again
with
this
tribute
to
his
physical
straightness
and
bloom
yes
he
looked
his
part
hang
it
he
looked
it
but
his
companion
still
lingered
a
shy
sociability
in
his
eye
if
you
re
walking
then
can
i
go
along
a
little
way
and
he
nodded
southward
down
the
shabby
gaudy
avenue
that
again
was
part
of
the
high
comedy
of
the
hour
that
millner
should
descend
the
spence
steps
at
young
spence
s
side
and
stroll
down
fifth
avenue
with
him
at
the
proudest
moment
of
the
afternoon
spence
s
secretary
walking
abroad
with
spence
s
heir
he
had
the
scientific
detachment
to
pull
out
his
watch
and
furtively
note
the
hour
yes
it
was
exactly
forty
minutes
since
he
had
rung
the
spence
and
handed
his
card
to
a
gelid
footman
who
openly
sceptical
of
his
claim
to
be
received
had
left
him
unceremoniously
planted
on
the
cold
tessellations
of
the
vestibule
some
day
miller
grinned
to
himself
i
think
i
ll
take
that
footman
as
or
to
do
the
and
he
pictured
his
marble
palace
rising
from
the
earth
to
form
the
mausoleum
of
a
footman
s
pride
only
forty
minutes
ago
and
now
he
had
his
opportunity
fast
and
he
never
meant
to
let
it
go
it
was
incredible
what
had
happened
in
the
interval
he
had
gone
up
the
spence
steps
an
unknown
young
man
out
of
a
job
and
with
no
substantial
hope
of
getting
into
one
a
needy
young
man
with
a
mother
and
two
limp
sisters
to
be
helped
and
a
lengthening
figure
of
debt
that
stood
by
his
bed
through
the
anxious
nights
and
he
went
down
the
steps
with
his
present
assured
and
his
future
lit
by
the
hues
of
the
rainbow
above
the
pot
of
gold
certainly
a
fellow
who
made
his
way
at
that
rate
had
it
in
him
and
could
afford
to
trust
his
star
descending
from
this
joyous
flight
he
stooped
his
ear
to
the
discourse
of
young
spence
my
father
ll
work
you
rather
hard
you
know
but
you
look
as
if
you
wouldn
t
mind
millner
pulled
up
his
inches
with
the
of
the
man
who
had
none
to
waste
oh
no
i
shan
t
mind
that
i
don
t
mind
any
amount
of
work
if
it
leads
to
just
so
draper
spence
assented
eagerly
that
s
what
i
feel
and
you
ll
find
that
whatever
my
father
undertakes
leads
to
such
awfully
fine
millner
tightened
his
lips
on
a
grin
he
was
thinking
only
of
where
the
work
would
lead
him
not
in
the
least
of
where
it
might
land
the
eminent
orlando
spence
but
he
looked
at
his
companion
sympathetically
you
re
a
philanthropist
like
your
father
i
see
oh
i
don
t
they
had
paused
at
a
crossing
and
young
draper
with
a
dubious
air
stood
striking
his
stick
against
the
i
believe
in
a
purpose
don
t
you
he
asked
lifting
his
blue
eyes
suddenly
to
millner
s
face
a
purpose
i
should
rather
say
so
i
believe
in
nothing
else
cried
millner
feeling
as
if
his
were
something
he
could
grip
in
his
hand
and
swing
like
a
club
young
spence
seemed
relieved
yes
i
tie
up
to
that
there
a
purpose
and
so
after
all
even
if
i
don
t
agree
with
my
father
on
minor
points
he
coloured
quickly
and
looked
again
at
millner
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
about
this
some
millner
smothered
another
smile
we
ll
have
lots
of
talks
i
oh
if
you
can
spare
the
time
said
draper
almost
humbly
why
i
shall
be
there
on
tap
for
father
not
draper
hesitated
with
another
smile
father
thinks
i
talk
too
much
that
i
keep
going
in
and
out
of
things
he
doesn
t
believe
in
analyzing
he
thinks
it
s
destructive
but
it
hasn
t
destroyed
my
he
looked
wistfully
up
and
down
the
clanging
street
and
that
s
the
main
thing
isn
t
it
i
mean
that
one
should
have
an
he
turned
back
almost
gaily
to
millner
i
suspect
you
re
a
revolutionist
too
revolutionist
rather
i
belong
to
the
red
syndicate
and
the
black
hand
millner
joyfully
assented
young
draper
chuckled
at
the
enormity
of
the
joke
first
rate
we
ll
have
incendiary
meetings
he
pulled
an
elaborately
armorial
watch
from
his
enfolding
furs
i
m
so
sorry
but
i
must
say
this
is
my
street
he
explained
millner
with
a
faint
twinge
of
envy
glanced
across
at
the
colonnaded
marble
edifice
in
the
farther
corner
going
to
the
club
he
said
carelessly
his
companion
looked
surprised
oh
no
i
never
go
it
s
too
and
he
brought
out
after
one
of
the
pauses
in
which
he
seemed
rather
breathlessly
to
measure
the
chances
of
his
listener
s
indulgence
i
m
just
going
over
to
a
little
bible
class
i
have
in
tenth
millner
for
a
moment
or
two
stood
watching
the
slim
figure
wind
its
way
through
the
mass
of
vehicles
to
the
opposite
corner
then
he
pursued
his
own
course
down
fifth
avenue
measuring
his
steps
to
the
rhythmic
refrain
it
s
too
easy
it
s
too
easy
it
s
too
easy
his
own
destination
being
the
small
shabby
flat
off
university
place
where
three
tender
females
awaited
the
result
of
his
mission
he
had
time
on
the
way
home
after
abandoning
himself
to
a
general
sense
of
triumph
to
dwell
specifically
on
the
various
aspects
of
his
achievement
viewed
materially
and
practically
it
was
a
thing
to
be
proud
of
yet
it
was
chiefly
on
aesthetic
grounds
because
he
had
done
so
exactly
what
he
had
set
out
to
do
that
he
glowed
with
pride
at
the
afternoon
s
work
for
after
all
any
young
man
with
the
proper
pull
might
have
applied
to
orlando
spence
for
the
post
of
secretary
and
even
have
penetrated
as
far
as
the
great
man
s
study
but
that
he
hugh
millner
should
not
only
have
forced
his
way
to
this
fastness
but
have
established
within
a
short
half
hour
his
right
to
remain
there
permanently
well
this
if
it
proved
anything
proved
that
the
first
rule
of
success
was
to
know
how
to
live
up
to
one
s
principles
one
must
have
a
plan
one
must
have
a
plan
the
young
man
murmured
looking
with
pity
at
the
vague
faces
which
the
crowd
bore
past
him
and
feeling
almost
impelled
to
detain
them
and
expound
his
doctrine
but
the
planlessness
of
average
human
nature
was
of
course
the
measure
of
his
opportunity
and
he
smiled
to
think
that
every
purposeless
face
he
met
was
a
guarantee
of
his
own
advancement
a
rung
in
the
ladder
he
meant
to
climb
yes
the
whole
secret
of
success
was
to
know
what
one
wanted
to
do
and
not
to
be
afraid
to
do
it
his
own
history
was
proving
that
already
he
had
not
been
afraid
to
give
up
his
small
but
safe
position
in
a
office
for
the
precarious
adventure
of
a
private
secretaryship
and
his
first
glimpse
of
his
new
employer
had
convinced
him
that
he
had
not
mistaken
his
calling
when
one
has
a
way
with
one
as
in
all
modesty
millner
knew
he
had
not
to
utilize
it
is
a
stupid
waste
of
force
and
when
he
had
learned
that
orlando
spence
was
in
search
of
a
private
secretary
who
should
be
able
to
give
him
intelligent
assistance
in
the
execution
of
his
philanthropic
schemes
the
young
man
felt
that
his
hour
had
come
it
was
no
part
of
his
plan
to
associate
himself
with
one
of
the
masters
of
finance
he
had
a
notion
that
minnows
who
go
to
a
whale
to
learn
how
to
grow
bigger
are
likely
to
be
swallowed
in
the
process
the
opportunity
of
a
clever
young
man
with
a
cool
head
and
no
prejudices
this
again
was
drawn
from
life
lay
rather
in
making
himself
indispensable
to
one
of
the
beneficent
rich
and
in
using
the
timidities
and
conformities
of
his
patron
as
the
means
of
his
scruples
about
formulating
these
principles
to
himself
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
in
his
college
days
he
had
hunted
the
hypothetical
moral
sense
to
its
lair
and
dragged
from
their
concealment
the
various
sentiments
dissembled
under
its
edifying
guise
his
strength
lay
in
his
precocious
insight
into
the
springs
of
action
and
in
his
refusal
to
classify
them
according
to
the
accepted
moral
and
social
sanctions
he
had
to
the
full
the
courage
of
his
lack
of
convictions
to
a
young
man
so
untrammelled
by
prejudice
it
was
that
helpless
philanthropists
like
orlando
spence
were
just
as
much
the
natural
diet
of
the
strong
as
the
lamb
is
of
the
wolf
it
was
pleasanter
to
eat
than
to
be
eaten
in
a
world
where
as
yet
there
seemed
to
be
no
third
alternative
and
any
scruples
one
might
feel
as
to
the
temporary
discomfort
of
one
s
victim
were
speedily
dispelled
by
that
larger
scientific
view
which
took
into
account
the
social
destructiveness
of
the
benevolent
millner
was
persuaded
that
every
individual
woe
mitigated
by
the
philanthropy
of
orlando
spence
added
just
so
much
to
the
of
human
inefficiency
and
it
was
one
of
his
favourite
subjects
of
speculation
to
picture
the
innumerable
social
evils
that
may
follow
upon
the
rescue
of
one
infant
from
mount
taygetus
we
re
all
born
to
prey
on
each
other
and
pity
for
suffering
is
one
of
the
most
elementary
stages
of
egotism
until
one
has
passed
beyond
and
acquired
a
taste
for
the
more
complex
forms
of
the
instinct
he
stopped
suddenly
checked
in
his
advance
by
a
sallow
wisp
of
a
dog
which
had
plunged
through
the
press
of
vehicles
to
hurl
itself
between
his
legs
millner
did
not
dislike
animals
though
he
preferred
that
they
should
be
healthy
and
handsome
the
dog
under
his
feet
was
neither
its
cringing
contour
showed
an
injudicious
mingling
of
races
and
its
meagre
coat
betrayed
the
deplorable
habit
of
sleeping
in
and
subsisting
on
an
innutritious
diet
in
addition
to
these
physical
disadvantages
its
shrinking
and
inconsequent
movements
revealed
a
congenital
weakness
of
character
which
even
under
more
favourable
conditions
would
hardly
have
qualified
it
to
become
a
useful
member
of
society
and
millner
was
not
sorry
to
notice
that
it
moved
with
a
limp
of
the
hind
leg
that
probably
doomed
it
to
speedy
extinction
the
absurdity
of
such
an
animal
s
attempting
to
cross
fifth
avenue
at
the
most
crowded
hour
of
the
afternoon
struck
him
as
only
less
great
than
the
irony
of
its
having
been
permitted
to
achieve
the
feat
and
he
stood
a
moment
looking
at
it
and
wondering
what
had
moved
it
to
the
attempt
it
was
really
a
perfect
type
of
the
human
derelict
which
orlando
spence
and
his
kind
were
devoting
their
millions
to
perpetuate
and
he
reflected
how
much
better
nature
knew
her
business
in
dealing
with
the
superfluous
quadruped
an
elderly
lady
advancing
in
the
opposite
direction
evidently
took
a
less
dispassionate
view
of
the
case
for
she
paused
to
remark
emotionally
oh
you
poor
thing
while
she
stooped
to
caress
the
object
of
her
sympathy
the
dog
with
characteristic
lack
of
discrimination
viewed
her
gesture
with
suspicion
and
met
it
with
a
snarl
the
lady
turned
pale
and
shrank
away
a
chivalrous
male
repelled
the
animal
with
his
umbrella
and
two
idle
boys
backed
his
action
by
a
vigorous
hi
the
object
of
these
hostile
demonstrations
apparently
attributing
them
not
to
its
own
unsocial
conduct
but
merely
to
the
chronic
animosity
of
the
universe
dashed
wildly
around
the
corner
into
a
side
street
and
as
it
did
so
millner
noticed
that
the
lame
leg
left
a
little
trail
of
blood
irresistibly
he
turned
the
corner
to
see
what
would
happen
next
it
was
deplorably
clear
that
the
animal
itself
had
no
plan
but
after
several
inconsequent
and
contradictory
movements
it
plunged
down
an
area
where
it
backed
up
against
the
iron
gate
forlornly
and
foolishly
at
bay
millner
still
following
looked
down
at
it
and
wondered
then
he
whistled
just
to
see
if
it
would
come
but
this
only
caused
it
to
start
up
on
its
quivering
legs
with
desperate
turns
of
the
head
that
measured
the
chances
of
escape
oh
hang
it
you
poor
devil
stay
there
if
you
like
the
young
man
murmured
walking
away
a
few
yards
off
he
looked
back
and
saw
that
the
dog
had
made
a
rush
out
of
the
area
and
was
limping
furtively
down
the
street
the
idle
boys
were
in
the
offing
and
he
disliked
the
thought
of
leaving
them
in
control
of
the
situation
softly
with
infinite
precautions
he
began
to
follow
the
dog
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
doing
it
but
the
impulse
was
overmastering
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
gaining
upon
his
quarry
but
with
a
cunning
sense
of
his
approach
it
suddenly
turned
and
hobbled
across
the
frozen
adjoining
a
shuttered
house
against
the
wall
at
the
back
of
the
plot
it
cowered
down
in
a
dirty
as
if
disheartened
by
the
struggle
millner
stood
outside
the
railings
and
looked
at
it
he
reflected
that
under
the
shelter
of
the
winter
dusk
it
might
have
the
luck
to
remain
there
unmolested
and
that
in
the
morning
it
would
probably
be
dead
of
cold
this
was
so
obviously
the
best
solution
that
he
began
to
move
away
again
but
as
he
did
so
the
idle
boys
confronted
him
ketch
yer
dog
for
yer
boss
they
grinned
millner
consigned
them
to
the
devil
and
stood
sternly
watching
them
till
the
first
stage
of
the
journey
had
carried
them
around
the
nearest
corner
then
after
pausing
to
look
once
more
up
and
down
the
empty
street
laid
his
hand
on
the
railing
and
vaulted
over
it
into
the
as
he
did
so
he
reflected
that
since
pity
for
suffering
was
one
of
the
most
elementary
forms
of
egotism
he
ought
to
have
remembered
that
it
was
necessarily
one
of
the
most
tenacious
ii
my
chief
aim
in
life
orlando
spence
repeated
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
straightened
the
on
his
short
blunt
nose
and
beamed
down
the
luncheon
table
at
the
two
young
men
who
shared
his
repast
his
glance
rested
on
his
son
draper
seated
opposite
him
behind
a
barrier
of
georgian
silver
and
orchids
but
his
words
were
addressed
to
his
secretary
who
stylograph
in
hand
had
turned
from
the
seductions
of
a
mushroom
in
order
to
jot
down
for
the
sunday
an
outline
of
his
employer
s
views
and
intentions
respecting
the
newly
endowed
orlando
spence
college
for
missionaries
it
was
spence
s
practice
to
receive
in
person
the
journalists
privileged
to
impart
his
opinions
to
a
waiting
world
but
during
the
last
few
months
and
especially
since
the
vast
project
of
the
missionary
college
had
been
in
process
of
development
the
pressure
of
business
and
beneficence
had
necessitated
millner
s
frequent
intervention
and
compelled
the
secretary
to
snatch
the
sense
of
his
patron
s
elucubrations
between
the
courses
of
their
hasty
meals
young
millner
had
a
healthy
appetite
and
it
was
not
one
of
his
least
sacrifices
to
be
so
often
obliged
to
curb
it
in
the
interest
of
his
advancement
but
whenever
he
waved
aside
one
of
the
triumphs
of
spence
s
he
was
conscious
of
rising
a
step
in
his
employer
s
favour
spence
did
not
despise
the
pleasures
of
the
table
though
he
appeared
to
regard
them
as
the
reward
of
success
rather
than
as
the
alleviation
of
effort
and
it
increased
his
sense
of
his
secretary
s
merit
to
note
how
keenly
the
young
man
enjoyed
the
fare
which
he
was
so
frequently
obliged
to
deny
himself
draper
having
subsisted
since
infancy
on
a
diet
of
truffles
and
terrapin
consumed
such
delicacies
with
the
insensibility
of
a
traveller
swallowing
a
railway
sandwich
but
millner
never
made
the
mistake
of
concealing
from
spence
his
sense
of
what
he
was
losing
when
duty
constrained
him
to
exchange
the
fork
for
the
pen
my
chief
aim
in
life
spence
repeated
removing
his
and
swinging
it
thoughtfully
on
his
finger
i
m
sorry
you
should
miss
this
millner
it
s
worth
while
why
i
suppose
i
might
say
that
my
chief
aim
in
life
is
to
leave
the
world
better
than
i
found
it
yes
i
don
t
know
that
i
could
put
it
better
than
that
to
leave
the
world
better
than
i
found
it
it
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
idea
to
use
that
as
a
wants
to
leave
the
world
better
than
he
found
it
s
exactly
the
point
i
should
like
to
make
in
this
talk
about
the
spence
paused
and
his
glance
once
more
reverted
to
his
son
who
having
pushed
aside
his
plate
sat
watching
millner
with
a
dreamy
intensity
and
it
s
the
point
i
want
to
make
with
you
too
draper
his
father
continued
genially
while
he
turned
over
with
a
critical
fork
the
plump
and
perfectly
matched
asparagus
which
a
footman
was
presenting
to
his
notice
i
want
to
make
you
feel
that
nothing
else
counts
in
comparison
with
that
no
amount
of
literary
success
or
intellectual
oh
i
feel
that
draper
murmured
with
one
of
his
quick
blushes
and
a
glance
that
wavered
between
his
father
and
millner
the
secretary
kept
his
eyes
on
his
notes
and
young
spence
continued
after
a
pause
only
the
thing
is
isn
t
it
to
try
and
find
out
just
what
make
the
world
better
to
to
find
out
his
father
echoed
compassionately
it
s
not
necessary
to
try
very
hard
goodness
is
what
makes
the
world
yes
yes
of
course
his
son
nervously
interposed
but
the
question
is
what
good
spence
with
a
darkening
brow
brought
his
fist
down
emphatically
on
the
damask
i
ll
thank
you
not
to
blaspheme
my
son
draper
s
head
reared
itself
a
trifle
higher
on
his
thin
neck
i
was
not
going
to
blaspheme
only
there
may
be
different
ways
there
s
where
you
re
mistaken
draper
there
s
only
one
way
there
s
my
way
said
spence
in
a
tone
of
unshaken
conviction
i
know
father
i
see
what
you
mean
but
don
t
you
see
that
even
your
way
wouldn
t
be
the
right
way
for
you
if
you
ceased
to
believe
that
it
was
his
father
looked
at
him
with
mingled
bewilderment
and
reprobation
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
fact
of
goodness
depends
on
my
conception
of
it
and
not
on
god
almighty
s
i
do
yes
in
a
specific
sense
young
draper
falteringly
maintained
and
spence
turned
with
a
discouraged
gesture
toward
his
secretary
s
suspended
pen
i
don
t
understand
your
scientific
jargon
draper
and
i
don
t
want
what
s
the
next
point
millner
no
no
bring
the
fruit
and
the
coffee
with
it
millner
keenly
aware
that
an
aromatic
au
was
describing
an
arc
behind
his
head
previous
to
being
rushed
back
to
the
pantry
under
young
draper
s
indifferent
eye
stiffened
himself
against
this
last
assault
of
the
enemy
and
read
out
firmly
what
relation
do
you
consider
that
a
man
s
business
conduct
should
bear
to
his
religious
and
domestic
life
spence
mused
a
moment
why
that
s
a
stupid
question
it
goes
over
the
same
ground
as
the
other
one
a
man
ought
to
do
good
with
his
money
that
s
all
go
at
this
point
the
butler
s
murmur
in
his
ear
caused
him
to
push
back
his
chair
and
to
arrest
millner
s
interrogatory
by
a
rapid
gesture
yes
i
m
coming
hold
the
spence
rose
and
plunged
into
the
adjoining
office
where
a
telephone
and
a
remington
divided
the
attention
of
a
young
lady
in
spectacles
who
was
preparing
for
zenana
work
in
the
east
as
the
door
closed
the
butler
having
placed
the
coffee
and
liqueurs
on
the
table
withdrew
in
the
rear
of
his
battalion
and
the
two
young
men
were
left
alone
beneath
the
rembrandts
and
hobbemas
on
the
walls
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
between
them
then
young
spence
leaning
across
the
table
said
in
the
lowered
tone
of
intimacy
why
do
you
suppose
he
dodged
that
last
question
millner
who
had
rapidly
taken
an
opulent
purple
fig
from
the
nearest
him
paused
in
surprise
in
the
act
of
hurrying
it
to
his
lips
i
mean
draper
hastened
on
the
question
as
to
the
relation
between
business
and
private
morality
it
s
such
an
interesting
one
and
he
s
just
the
person
who
ought
to
tackle
millner
despatching
the
fig
glanced
down
at
his
notes
i
don
t
think
your
father
meant
to
dodge
the
young
draper
continued
to
look
at
him
intently
you
think
he
imagined
that
his
answer
really
covers
the
ground
as
much
as
it
needs
to
be
the
son
of
the
house
glanced
away
with
a
sigh
you
know
things
about
him
that
i
don
t
he
said
wistfully
but
without
a
tinge
of
resentment
in
his
tone
oh
as
to
that
may
i
give
myself
some
coffee
millner
in
his
walk
around
the
table
to
fill
his
cup
paused
a
moment
to
lay
an
affectionate
hand
on
draper
s
shoulder
perhaps
i
know
him
in
a
sense
outsiders
often
get
a
more
accurate
draper
considered
this
and
your
idea
is
that
he
acts
on
principles
he
has
never
thought
of
testing
or
defining
millner
looked
up
quickly
and
for
an
instant
their
glances
crossed
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
he
s
an
inconscient
instrument
of
goodness
as
it
were
a
a
sort
of
blindly
beneficent
force
the
other
smiled
that
s
not
a
bad
definition
i
know
one
thing
about
him
at
any
rate
he
s
awfully
upset
at
your
having
chucked
your
bible
a
shadow
fell
on
young
spence
s
candid
brow
i
know
but
what
can
i
do
about
it
that
s
what
i
was
thinking
of
when
i
tried
to
show
him
that
goodness
in
a
certain
sense
is
purely
subjective
that
one
can
t
do
good
against
one
s
again
his
glance
appealed
to
millner
understand
me
don
t
you
millner
stirred
his
coffee
in
a
silence
not
unclouded
by
perplexity
theoretically
perhaps
it
s
a
pretty
question
certainly
but
i
also
understand
your
father
s
feeling
that
it
hasn
t
much
to
do
with
real
life
especially
now
that
he
s
got
to
make
a
speech
in
connection
with
the
founding
of
this
missionary
college
he
may
think
that
any
hint
of
internecine
strife
will
weaken
his
prestige
mightn
t
you
have
waited
a
little
longer
how
could
i
when
i
might
have
been
expected
to
take
a
part
in
this
performance
to
talk
and
say
things
i
didn
t
mean
that
was
exactly
what
made
me
decide
not
to
the
door
opened
and
spence
the
room
as
he
did
so
his
son
rose
abruptly
as
if
to
leave
it
where
are
you
off
to
draper
the
banker
asked
i
m
in
rather
a
hurry
sir
spence
looked
at
his
watch
you
can
t
be
in
more
of
a
hurry
than
i
am
and
i
ve
got
seven
minutes
and
a
he
seated
himself
behind
the
coffee
tray
lit
a
cigar
laid
his
watch
on
the
table
and
signed
to
draper
to
resume
his
place
no
millner
don
t
you
go
i
want
you
he
turned
to
the
secretary
you
know
that
draper
s
given
up
his
bible
class
i
understand
it
s
not
from
the
pressure
of
engagements
spence
s
narrow
lips
took
an
ironic
curve
under
the
stubble
of
his
moustache
it
s
on
principle
he
tells
me
he
s
against
doing
good
draper
lifted
a
protesting
hand
it
s
not
exactly
that
father
i
know
you
ll
tell
me
it
s
some
scientific
quibble
that
i
don
t
understand
i
ve
never
had
time
to
go
in
for
intellectual
i
ve
found
too
many
people
down
in
the
mire
who
needed
a
hand
to
pull
them
out
a
busy
man
has
to
take
his
choice
between
helping
his
and
theorizing
about
them
i
ve
preferred
to
help
you
might
take
that
down
for
the
millner
and
i
thank
god
i
ve
never
stopped
to
ask
what
made
me
want
to
do
good
i
ve
just
yielded
to
the
impulse
that
s
spence
turned
back
to
his
son
better
men
than
either
of
us
have
been
satisfied
with
that
creed
my
draper
was
silent
and
spence
once
more
addressed
himself
to
his
secretary
millner
you
re
a
reader
i
ve
caught
you
at
it
and
i
know
this
boy
talks
to
you
what
have
you
got
to
say
do
you
suppose
a
bible
class
ever
anybody
millner
paused
a
moment
feeling
all
through
his
nervous
system
the
fateful
tremor
of
the
balance
that
s
what
i
was
just
trying
to
tell
him
sir
ah
you
were
that
s
good
then
i
ll
only
say
one
thing
more
your
doing
what
you
ve
done
at
this
particular
moment
hurts
me
more
draper
than
your
teaching
the
gospel
of
jesus
could
possibly
have
hurt
those
young
men
over
in
tenth
spence
arose
and
restored
his
watch
to
his
pocket
i
shall
want
you
in
twenty
minutes
the
door
closed
on
him
and
for
a
while
the
two
young
men
sat
silent
behind
their
cigar
fumes
then
draper
spence
broke
out
with
a
catch
in
his
throat
that
s
what
i
can
t
bear
millner
what
i
simply
can
t
to
hurt
him
to
hurt
his
faith
in
it
s
an
awful
responsibility
isn
t
it
to
tamper
with
anybody
s
faith
in
anything
iii
the
twenty
minutes
prolonged
themselves
to
forty
the
forty
to
fifty
and
the
fifty
to
an
hour
and
still
millner
waited
for
spence
s
summons
during
the
two
years
of
his
secretaryship
the
young
man
had
learned
the
significance
of
such
postponements
spence
s
days
were
organized
like
a
railway
and
a
delay
of
an
hour
implied
a
casualty
as
as
the
breaking
down
of
an
express
of
the
cause
of
the
present
derangement
hugh
millner
was
ignorant
and
the
experience
of
the
last
months
allowed
him
to
fluctuate
between
conflicting
conjectures
all
were
based
on
the
indisputable
fact
that
spence
was
bothered
had
for
some
time
past
been
and
it
was
one
of
millner
s
discoveries
that
an
extremely
parsimonious
use
of
the
emotions
underlay
spence
s
expansive
manner
and
fraternal
phraseology
and
that
he
did
not
throw
away
his
feelings
any
more
than
for
all
his
philanthropy
he
threw
away
his
money
if
he
was
bothered
then
it
could
be
only
because
a
careful
survey
of
his
situation
had
forced
on
him
some
unpleasant
fact
with
which
he
was
not
immediately
prepared
to
deal
and
any
unpreparedness
on
spence
s
part
was
also
a
significant
symptom
obviously
millner
s
original
conception
of
his
employer
s
character
had
suffered
extensive
modification
but
no
final
outline
had
replaced
the
first
conjectural
image
the
two
years
spent
in
spence
s
service
had
produced
too
many
contradictory
impressions
to
be
fitted
into
any
definite
pattern
and
the
chief
lesson
millner
had
learned
from
them
was
that
life
was
less
of
an
exact
science
and
character
a
more
incalculable
element
than
he
had
been
taught
in
the
schools
in
the
light
of
this
revised
impression
his
own
footing
seemed
less
secure
than
he
had
imagined
and
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
he
was
climbing
more
slippery
than
they
had
looked
from
below
he
was
not
without
the
reassuring
sense
of
having
made
himself
in
certain
small
ways
necessary
to
spence
and
this
conviction
was
confirmed
by
draper
s
reiterated
assurance
of
his
father
s
appreciation
but
millner
had
begun
to
suspect
that
one
might
be
necessary
to
spence
one
day
and
a
superfluity
if
not
an
obstacle
the
next
and
that
it
would
take
superhuman
astuteness
to
foresee
how
and
when
the
change
would
occur
every
fluctuation
of
the
great
man
s
mood
was
therefore
anxiously
noted
by
the
young
meteorologist
in
his
service
and
this
observer
s
vigilance
was
now
strained
to
the
utmost
by
the
little
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
man
s
hand
adumbrated
by
the
banker
s
unpunctuality
when
spence
finally
appeared
his
aspect
did
not
tend
to
dissipate
the
cloud
he
wore
what
millner
had
learned
to
call
his
face
a
blank
barred
countenance
in
which
only
an
occasional
twitch
of
the
lids
behind
his
glasses
suggested
that
some
one
was
on
the
watch
in
this
mood
spence
usually
seemed
unconscious
of
his
secretary
s
presence
or
aware
of
it
only
as
an
arm
terminating
in
a
pen
millner
accustomed
on
such
occasions
to
exist
merely
as
a
function
sat
waiting
for
the
click
of
the
spring
that
should
set
him
in
action
but
the
pressure
not
being
applied
he
finally
hazarded
are
we
to
go
on
with
the
sir
spence
who
had
been
pacing
up
and
down
between
the
desk
and
the
fireplace
threw
himself
into
his
usual
seat
at
millner
s
elbow
i
don
t
understand
this
new
notion
of
draper
s
he
said
abruptly
where
s
he
got
it
from
no
one
ever
learned
irreligion
in
my
he
turned
his
eyes
on
millner
who
had
the
sense
of
being
scrutinized
through
a
window
which
left
him
visible
while
it
concealed
his
observer
the
young
man
let
his
pen
describe
two
or
three
vague
patterns
on
the
blank
sheet
before
him
draper
has
ideas
he
risked
at
last
spence
looked
hard
at
him
that
s
all
right
he
said
i
want
my
son
to
have
everything
but
what
s
the
point
of
mixing
up
ideas
and
principles
i
ve
seen
fellows
who
did
that
and
they
were
generally
trying
to
borrow
five
dollars
to
get
away
from
the
sheriff
what
s
all
this
talk
about
goodness
goodness
isn
t
an
idea
it
s
a
fact
it
s
as
solid
as
a
business
proposition
and
it
s
draper
s
duty
as
the
son
of
a
wealthy
man
and
the
prospective
steward
of
a
great
fortune
to
elevate
the
standards
of
other
young
men
of
young
men
who
haven
t
had
his
opportunities
the
rich
ought
to
preach
contentment
and
to
set
the
example
themselves
we
have
our
cares
but
we
ought
to
conceal
them
we
ought
to
be
cheerful
and
accept
things
as
they
are
not
go
about
sowing
dissent
and
restlessness
what
has
draper
got
to
give
these
boys
in
his
bible
class
that
s
so
much
better
than
what
he
wants
to
take
from
them
that
s
the
question
i
d
like
to
have
answered
spence
carried
away
by
his
own
eloquence
had
removed
his
and
was
twirling
it
about
his
extended
with
the
gesture
habitual
to
him
when
he
spoke
in
public
after
a
pause
he
went
on
with
a
drop
to
the
level
of
private
intercourse
i
tell
you
this
because
i
know
you
have
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
draper
he
has
a
high
opinion
of
your
brains
but
you
re
a
practical
fellow
and
you
must
see
what
i
mean
try
to
make
draper
see
it
make
him
understand
how
it
looks
to
have
him
drop
his
bible
class
just
at
this
particular
time
it
was
his
own
choice
to
take
up
religious
teaching
among
young
men
he
began
with
our
and
then
the
work
spread
and
was
blessed
i
was
almost
alarmed
at
one
time
at
the
way
it
took
hold
of
him
when
the
papers
began
to
talk
about
him
as
a
formative
influence
i
was
afraid
he
d
lose
his
head
and
go
into
the
church
luckily
he
tried
university
settlement
first
but
just
as
i
thought
he
was
settling
down
to
that
he
took
to
worrying
about
the
higher
criticism
and
saying
he
couldn
t
go
on
teaching
as
history
i
can
t
see
that
any
good
ever
came
of
criticizing
what
our
parents
believed
and
it
s
a
queer
time
for
draper
to
criticize
belief
just
as
i
m
backing
it
to
the
extent
of
five
millner
remained
silent
and
as
though
his
silence
were
an
argument
spence
continued
combatively
draper
s
always
talking
about
some
distinction
between
religion
and
morality
i
don
t
understand
what
he
means
i
got
my
morals
out
of
the
bible
and
i
guess
there
s
enough
left
in
it
for
draper
if
religion
won
t
make
a
man
moral
i
don
t
see
why
irreligion
should
and
he
talks
about
using
his
mind
well
can
t
he
use
that
in
wall
street
a
man
can
get
a
good
deal
farther
in
life
watching
the
market
than
picking
holes
in
genesis
and
he
can
do
more
good
too
there
s
a
time
for
everything
and
draper
seems
to
me
to
have
mixed
up
with
spence
replaced
his
and
stretching
his
hand
to
the
silver
box
at
his
elbow
extracted
from
it
one
of
the
long
cigars
sheathed
in
which
were
reserved
for
his
private
consumption
the
secretary
hastened
to
tender
him
a
match
and
for
a
moment
he
puffed
in
silence
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
different
note
i
ve
got
about
all
the
bother
i
can
handle
just
now
without
this
nonsense
of
draper
s
that
was
one
of
the
trustees
of
the
college
with
me
it
seems
the
has
been
trying
to
stir
up
a
fuss
spence
paused
and
turned
his
on
his
secretary
you
haven
t
heard
from
them
he
asked
from
the
millner
s
surprise
was
genuine
he
detected
a
gleam
of
relief
behind
spence
s
glasses
it
may
be
just
malicious
talk
that
s
the
worst
of
good
works
they
bring
out
all
the
meanness
in
human
nature
and
then
there
are
always
women
mixed
up
in
them
and
there
never
was
a
woman
yet
who
understood
the
difference
between
philanthropy
and
he
drew
again
at
his
cigar
and
then
with
an
unwonted
movement
leaned
forward
and
mechanically
pushed
the
box
toward
millner
help
yourself
he
said
millner
as
mechanically
took
one
of
the
virginally
cinctured
cigars
and
began
to
undo
its
wrappings
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
privileged
to
detach
that
golden
girdle
and
nothing
could
have
given
him
a
better
measure
of
the
importance
of
the
situation
and
of
the
degree
to
which
he
was
apparently
involved
in
it
you
remember
that
san
pablo
rubber
business
that
s
what
they
ve
been
raking
up
said
spence
abruptly
millner
paused
in
the
act
of
striking
a
match
then
with
an
appreciable
effort
of
the
will
he
completed
the
gesture
applied
the
flame
to
his
cigar
and
took
a
long
inhalation
the
cigar
was
certainly
delicious
spence
drawing
a
little
closer
leaned
forward
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
the
touch
caused
millner
to
turn
his
head
and
for
an
instant
the
glance
of
the
two
men
crossed
at
short
range
millner
was
conscious
first
of
a
nearer
view
than
he
had
ever
had
of
his
employer
s
face
and
of
its
vaguely
suggesting
a
seamed
sandstone
head
the
kind
of
thing
that
lies
in
a
corner
in
the
court
of
a
museum
and
in
which
only
the
round
enamelled
eyes
have
resisted
the
wear
of
time
his
next
feeling
was
that
he
had
now
reached
the
moment
to
which
the
offer
of
the
cigar
had
been
a
prelude
he
had
always
known
that
sooner
or
later
such
a
moment
would
come
all
his
life
in
a
sense
had
been
a
preparation
for
it
but
in
entering
spence
s
service
he
had
not
foreseen
that
it
would
present
itself
in
this
form
he
had
seen
himself
consciously
guiding
that
gentleman
up
to
the
moment
rather
than
being
thrust
into
it
by
a
stronger
hand
and
his
first
act
of
reflection
was
the
resolve
that
in
the
end
his
hand
should
prove
the
stronger
of
the
two
this
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
idea
that
to
be
stronger
than
spence
s
it
would
have
to
be
very
strong
indeed
it
was
odd
that
he
should
feel
this
since
as
far
as
verbal
communication
went
it
was
spence
who
was
asking
for
his
support
in
a
theoretical
statement
of
the
case
the
banker
would
have
figured
as
being
at
millner
s
mercy
but
one
of
the
queerest
things
about
experience
was
the
way
it
made
light
of
theory
millner
felt
now
as
though
he
were
being
crushed
by
some
inexorable
engine
of
which
he
had
been
playing
with
the
lever
he
had
always
been
intensely
interested
in
observing
his
own
reactions
and
had
regarded
this
faculty
of
as
of
immense
advantage
in
such
a
career
as
he
had
planned
he
felt
this
still
even
in
the
act
of
noting
his
own
bewilderment
felt
it
the
more
in
contrast
to
the
odd
unconsciousness
of
spence
s
attitude
of
the
incredible
candour
of
his
and
it
was
clear
that
spence
was
not
troubled
by
the
repercussion
of
his
actions
in
the
consciousness
of
others
and
this
looked
like
a
weakness
unless
it
were
instead
a
great
strength
through
the
hum
of
these
swarming
thoughts
spence
s
voice
was
going
on
that
s
the
only
rag
of
proof
they
ve
got
and
they
got
it
by
one
of
those
nasty
accidents
that
nobody
can
guard
against
i
don
t
care
how
conscientiously
a
man
attends
to
business
he
can
t
always
protect
himself
against
meddlesome
people
i
don
t
pretend
to
know
how
the
letter
came
into
their
hands
but
they
ve
got
it
and
they
mean
to
use
it
and
they
mean
to
say
that
you
wrote
it
for
me
and
that
you
knew
what
it
was
about
when
you
wrote
it
they
ll
probably
be
after
you
tomorrow
spence
restoring
his
cigar
to
his
lips
puffed
at
it
slowly
in
the
pause
that
followed
there
was
an
instant
during
which
the
universe
seemed
to
hugh
millner
like
a
bent
above
his
single
consciousness
if
he
spoke
what
thunders
would
be
sent
back
to
him
from
that
intently
listening
vastness
you
see
said
spence
the
universal
ear
bent
closer
as
if
to
catch
the
least
articulation
of
millner
s
narrowed
lips
but
when
he
opened
them
it
was
merely
to
his
cigar
and
for
a
short
space
nothing
passed
between
the
two
men
but
an
exchange
of
what
do
you
mean
to
do
there
s
the
point
spence
at
length
sent
through
the
rings
oh
yes
the
point
was
there
as
distinctly
before
millner
as
the
tip
of
his
expensive
cigar
he
had
seen
it
coming
quite
as
soon
as
spence
he
knew
that
fate
was
handing
him
an
ultimatum
but
the
sense
of
the
formidable
echo
which
his
least
answer
would
rouse
kept
him
doggedly
and
almost
helplessly
silent
to
let
spence
talk
on
as
long
as
possible
was
no
doubt
the
best
way
of
gaining
time
but
millner
knew
that
his
silence
was
really
due
to
his
dread
of
the
echo
suddenly
however
in
a
reaction
of
impatience
at
his
own
indecision
he
began
to
speak
the
sound
of
his
voice
cleared
his
mind
and
strengthened
his
resolve
it
was
odd
how
the
word
seemed
to
shape
the
act
though
one
knew
how
ancillary
it
really
was
as
he
talked
it
was
as
if
the
globe
had
swung
around
and
he
himself
were
upright
on
its
axis
with
spence
underneath
on
his
head
through
the
ensuing
interchange
of
concise
and
rapid
speech
there
sounded
in
millner
s
ears
the
refrain
to
which
he
had
walked
down
fifth
avenue
after
his
first
talk
with
spence
it
s
too
easy
it
s
too
easy
it
s
too
yes
it
was
even
easier
than
he
had
expected
his
sensation
was
that
of
the
skilful
carver
who
feels
his
good
blade
sink
into
a
tender
joint
as
he
went
on
talking
this
surprised
sense
of
mastery
was
like
wine
in
his
veins
spence
was
at
his
mercy
after
all
that
was
what
it
came
to
but
this
new
view
of
the
case
did
not
lessen
millner
s
sense
of
spence
s
strength
it
merely
revealed
to
him
his
own
superiority
spence
was
even
stronger
than
he
had
suspected
there
could
be
no
better
proof
of
that
than
his
faith
in
millner
s
power
to
grasp
the
situation
and
his
tacit
recognition
of
the
young
man
s
right
to
make
the
most
of
it
millner
felt
that
spence
would
have
despised
him
even
more
for
not
using
his
advantage
than
for
not
seeing
it
and
this
homage
to
his
capacity
nerved
him
to
greater
alertness
and
made
the
concluding
moments
of
their
talk
as
physically
exhilarating
as
some
hotly
contested
game
when
the
conclusion
was
reached
and
millner
stood
at
the
goal
the
golden
trophy
in
his
grasp
his
first
conscious
thought
was
one
of
regret
that
the
struggle
was
over
he
would
have
liked
to
prolong
their
talk
for
the
purely
aesthetic
pleasure
of
making
spence
lose
time
and
better
still
of
making
him
forget
that
he
was
losing
it
the
sense
of
advantage
that
the
situation
conferred
was
so
great
that
when
spence
rose
it
was
as
if
millner
were
dismissing
him
and
when
he
reached
his
hand
toward
the
it
seemed
to
be
one
of
millner
s
cigars
that
he
was
taking
iv
there
had
been
only
one
condition
attached
to
the
transaction
millner
was
to
speak
to
draper
about
the
bible
class
the
condition
was
easy
to
fulfil
millner
was
confident
of
his
power
to
deflect
his
young
friend
s
purpose
and
he
knew
the
opportunity
would
be
given
him
before
the
day
was
over
his
professional
duties
despatched
he
had
only
to
go
up
to
his
room
to
wait
draper
nearly
always
looked
in
on
him
for
a
moment
before
dinner
it
was
the
hour
most
propitious
to
their
elliptic
interchange
of
words
and
silences
meanwhile
the
waiting
was
an
occupation
in
itself
millner
looked
about
his
room
with
new
eyes
since
the
first
thrill
of
initiation
into
its
complicated
comforts
the
the
telephone
the
and
the
vast
mirrored
presses
through
which
he
was
always
hunting
his
scant
outfit
millner
s
room
had
interested
him
no
more
than
a
in
which
he
might
have
been
travelling
but
now
it
had
acquired
a
sort
of
historic
significance
as
the
witness
of
the
astounding
change
in
his
fate
it
was
corsica
it
was
brienne
it
was
the
kind
of
spot
that
posterity
might
yet
mark
with
a
tablet
then
he
reflected
that
he
should
soon
be
leaving
it
and
the
lustre
of
its
monumental
mahogany
was
veiled
in
pathos
why
indeed
should
he
linger
on
in
bondage
he
perceived
with
a
certain
surprise
that
the
only
thing
he
should
regret
would
be
leaving
draper
it
was
odd
it
was
inconsequent
it
was
almost
exasperating
that
such
a
regret
should
obscure
his
triumph
why
in
the
world
should
he
suddenly
take
to
regretting
draper
if
there
were
any
logic
in
human
likings
it
should
be
to
spence
that
he
inclined
draper
dear
lad
had
the
illusion
of
an
intellectual
sympathy
between
them
but
that
millner
knew
was
an
affair
of
reading
and
not
of
character
draper
s
temerities
would
always
be
of
that
kind
whereas
his
own
well
his
own
put
to
the
proof
had
now
definitely
classed
him
with
spence
rather
than
with
spence
s
son
it
was
a
consequence
of
this
new
condition
of
his
having
thus
distinctly
and
irrevocably
classed
himself
that
when
draper
at
length
brought
upon
the
scene
his
shy
shamble
and
his
wistful
smile
millner
for
the
first
time
had
to
steel
himself
against
them
instead
of
yielding
to
their
charm
in
the
new
order
upon
which
he
had
entered
one
principle
of
the
old
survived
the
point
of
honour
between
allies
and
millner
had
promised
spence
to
speak
to
draper
about
his
bible
class
draper
thrown
back
in
his
chair
and
swinging
a
loose
leg
across
a
meagre
knee
listened
with
his
habitual
gravity
his
downcast
eyes
seemed
to
pursue
the
vision
which
millner
s
words
evoked
and
the
words
to
their
speaker
took
on
a
new
sound
as
that
candid
consciousness
refracted
them
you
know
dear
boy
i
perfectly
see
your
father
s
point
it
s
naturally
distressing
to
him
at
this
particular
time
to
have
any
hint
of
civil
war
leak
out
draper
sat
upright
laying
his
lank
legs
knee
to
knee
that
s
it
then
i
thought
that
was
it
millner
raised
a
surprised
glance
what
it
that
it
should
be
at
this
particular
time
why
naturally
as
i
say
just
as
he
s
making
as
it
were
his
public
profession
of
faith
you
know
to
men
like
your
father
convictions
are
irreducible
elements
they
can
t
be
split
up
and
differently
combined
and
your
exegetical
scruples
seem
to
him
to
strike
at
the
very
root
of
his
draper
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
shuffled
across
the
room
then
he
turned
about
and
stood
before
his
friend
is
it
that
or
is
it
this
he
said
and
with
the
word
he
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
proffered
it
silently
to
millner
the
latter
as
he
unfolded
it
was
first
aware
of
an
intense
surprise
at
the
young
man
s
abruptness
of
tone
and
gesture
usually
draper
fluttered
long
about
his
point
before
making
it
and
his
sudden
movement
seemed
as
mechanical
as
the
impulsion
conveyed
by
some
strong
spring
the
spring
of
course
was
in
the
letter
and
to
it
millner
turned
his
startled
glance
feeling
the
while
that
by
some
curious
cleavage
of
perception
he
was
continuing
to
watch
draper
while
he
read
oh
the
beasts
he
cried
he
and
draper
were
face
to
face
across
the
sheet
which
had
dropped
between
them
the
youth
s
features
were
tightened
by
a
smile
that
was
like
the
ligature
of
a
wound
he
looked
white
and
withered
ah
you
knew
then
millner
sat
still
and
after
a
moment
draper
turned
from
him
walked
to
the
hearth
and
leaned
against
the
chimney
propping
his
chin
on
his
hands
millner
his
head
thrown
back
stared
up
at
the
ceiling
which
had
suddenly
become
to
him
the
image
of
the
universal
hanging
over
his
consciousness
you
knew
then
draper
repeated
millner
remained
silent
he
had
perceived
with
the
surprise
of
a
mathematician
working
out
a
new
problem
that
the
lie
which
spence
had
just
bought
of
him
was
exactly
the
one
gift
he
could
give
of
his
own
free
will
to
spence
s
son
this
discovery
gave
the
world
a
strange
new
and
set
millner
s
theories
spinning
about
his
brain
like
the
cabin
furniture
of
a
tossing
ship
you
said
draper
in
a
tone
of
quiet
affirmation
millner
righted
himself
and
grasped
the
arms
of
his
chair
as
if
that
too
were
reeling
about
this
blackguardly
charge
draper
was
studying
him
intently
what
does
it
matter
if
it
s
blackguardly
matter
millner
stammered
it
s
that
of
course
in
any
case
but
the
point
is
whether
it
s
true
or
draper
bent
down
and
picking
up
the
crumpled
letter
smoothed
it
out
between
his
fingers
the
point
is
whether
my
father
when
he
was
publicly
denouncing
the
peonage
abuses
on
the
san
pablo
plantations
over
a
year
ago
had
actually
sold
out
his
stock
as
he
announced
at
the
time
or
whether
as
they
say
here
how
do
they
put
it
he
had
simply
transferred
it
to
a
dummy
till
the
scandal
should
blow
over
and
has
meanwhile
gone
on
drawing
his
forty
per
cent
interest
on
five
thousand
shares
there
s
the
millner
had
never
before
heard
his
young
friend
put
a
case
with
such
unadorned
precision
his
language
was
like
that
of
spence
making
a
statement
to
a
committee
meeting
and
the
resemblance
to
his
father
flashed
out
with
ironic
incongruity
you
see
why
i
ve
brought
this
letter
to
you
i
couldn
t
go
to
with
it
draper
s
voice
faltered
and
the
resemblance
vanished
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared
no
you
couldn
t
go
to
him
with
it
said
millner
slowly
and
since
they
say
here
that
know
that
they
ve
got
your
letter
proving
it
the
muscles
of
draper
s
face
quivered
as
if
a
blinding
light
had
been
swept
over
it
for
god
s
sake
millner
it
s
all
right
it
s
all
right
said
millner
rising
to
his
feet
draper
caught
him
by
the
wrist
you
re
sure
you
re
absolutely
sure
sure
they
know
they
ve
got
nothing
to
go
draper
fell
back
a
step
and
looked
almost
sternly
at
his
friend
you
know
that
s
not
what
i
mean
i
don
t
care
a
straw
what
they
think
they
ve
got
to
go
on
i
want
to
know
if
my
father
s
all
right
if
he
is
they
can
say
what
they
millner
again
felt
himself
under
the
concentrated
scrutiny
of
the
ceiling
of
course
of
course
i
you
understand
then
why
don
t
you
answer
millner
looked
compassionately
at
the
boy
s
struggling
face
decidedly
the
battle
was
to
the
strong
and
he
was
not
sorry
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
legions
but
draper
s
pain
was
as
awkward
as
a
material
obstacle
as
something
that
one
stumbled
over
in
a
race
you
know
what
i
m
driving
at
again
spence
s
tone
sounded
oddly
through
his
son
s
strained
voice
if
my
father
s
so
awfully
upset
about
my
giving
up
my
bible
class
and
letting
it
be
known
that
i
do
so
on
conscientious
grounds
is
it
because
he
s
afraid
it
may
be
considered
a
criticism
on
something
has
done
which
which
won
t
bear
the
test
of
the
doctrines
he
believes
in
draper
with
the
last
question
squared
himself
in
front
of
millner
as
if
suspecting
that
the
latter
meant
to
evade
it
by
flight
but
millner
had
never
felt
more
disposed
to
stand
his
ground
than
at
that
moment
no
by
jove
no
it
s
not
his
relief
almost
escaped
him
in
a
cry
as
he
lifted
his
head
to
give
back
draper
s
look
on
your
honour
the
other
passionately
pressed
him
oh
on
anybody
s
you
like
on
millner
could
hardly
restrain
a
laugh
of
relief
it
was
vertiginous
to
find
himself
spared
after
all
the
need
of
an
altruistic
lie
he
perceived
that
they
were
the
kind
he
least
liked
draper
took
a
deep
breath
you
don
t
millner
a
lot
depends
on
this
you
don
t
really
think
my
father
has
any
ulterior
motive
i
think
he
has
none
but
his
horror
of
seeing
you
go
straight
to
perdition
they
looked
at
each
other
again
and
draper
s
tension
was
suddenly
relieved
by
a
free
boyish
laugh
it
s
his
convictions
it
s
just
his
funny
old
convictions
it
s
that
and
nothing
else
on
earth
draper
turned
back
to
the
he
had
left
and
let
his
narrow
figure
sink
down
into
it
as
into
a
bath
then
he
looked
over
at
millner
with
a
smile
i
can
see
that
i
ve
been
worrying
him
horribly
so
he
really
thinks
i
m
on
the
road
to
perdition
of
course
you
can
fancy
what
a
sick
minute
i
had
when
i
thought
it
might
be
this
other
reason
the
damnable
insinuation
in
this
draper
crumpled
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
leaned
forward
to
toss
it
into
the
coals
of
the
grate
i
ought
to
have
known
better
of
course
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
as
you
say
my
father
can
t
conceive
how
conduct
may
be
independent
of
creed
that
s
where
i
was
stupid
and
rather
base
but
that
letter
made
me
dizzy
i
couldn
t
think
even
now
i
can
t
very
clearly
i
m
not
sure
what
convictions
require
of
me
they
seem
to
me
so
much
less
to
be
considered
than
his
when
i
ve
done
half
the
good
to
people
that
he
has
it
will
be
time
enough
to
begin
attacking
their
beliefs
meanwhile
meanwhile
i
can
t
touch
his
draper
leaned
forward
stretching
his
lank
arms
along
his
knees
his
face
was
as
clear
as
a
spring
sky
i
touch
them
millner
go
and
tell
him
so
v
in
the
study
a
half
hour
later
spence
watch
in
hand
was
doling
out
his
minutes
again
the
peril
conjured
he
had
recovered
his
dominion
over
time
he
turned
his
commanding
on
millner
it
s
all
settled
then
tell
draper
i
m
sorry
not
to
see
him
again
but
i
m
to
speak
at
the
dinner
of
the
legal
relief
association
and
i
m
due
there
in
five
minutes
you
and
he
dine
alone
here
i
suppose
tell
him
i
appreciate
what
he
s
done
some
day
he
ll
see
that
to
leave
the
world
better
than
we
find
it
is
the
best
we
can
hope
to
do
you
ve
finished
the
notes
for
the
be
sure
you
don
t
forget
that
phrase
well
good
evening
that
s
all
i
smooth
and
compact
in
his
glossy
evening
clothes
spence
advanced
toward
the
study
door
but
as
he
reached
it
his
secretary
stood
there
before
him
it
s
not
quite
all
spence
turned
on
him
a
look
in
which
impatience
was
faintly
tinged
with
apprehension
what
else
is
there
it
s
two
and
a
half
minutes
to
millner
stood
his
ground
it
won
t
take
longer
than
that
i
want
to
tell
you
that
if
you
can
conveniently
replace
me
i
d
like
there
are
reasons
why
i
shall
have
to
leave
millner
was
conscious
of
reddening
as
he
spoke
his
redness
deepened
under
spence
s
dispassionate
scrutiny
he
saw
at
once
that
the
banker
was
not
surprised
at
his
announcement
well
i
suppose
that
s
natural
enough
you
ll
want
to
make
a
start
for
yourself
now
only
of
course
for
the
sake
of
appearances
oh
certainly
millner
hastily
agreed
well
then
is
that
all
spence
repeated
millner
paused
as
if
in
search
of
an
appropriate
formula
but
after
a
moment
he
gave
up
the
search
and
pulled
from
his
pocket
an
envelope
which
he
held
out
to
his
employer
i
merely
want
to
give
this
the
hand
which
spence
had
extended
dropped
to
his
side
and
his
face
grew
chalky
give
it
back
his
voice
was
as
thick
as
millner
s
what
s
happened
is
the
bargain
off
oh
no
i
ve
given
you
my
your
word
spence
lowered
at
him
i
d
like
to
know
what
that
s
worth
millner
continued
to
hold
out
the
envelope
you
do
know
now
it
s
worth
it
s
worth
my
spence
standing
motionless
before
him
hesitated
for
an
appreciable
space
of
time
his
lips
parted
once
or
twice
under
their
stubble
and
at
last
emitted
how
much
more
do
you
want
millner
broke
into
a
laugh
oh
i
ve
got
all
i
want
all
and
more
what
from
the
others
are
you
crazy
no
you
are
said
millner
with
a
sudden
recovery

moistened

millner
glanced
past
the
banker
s
figure
at
his
rich
densely
coloured
background
of
spanish
leather
and
mahogany
he
remembered
that
it
was
from
this
very
threshold
that
he
had
first
seen

son

guarantee
you

he
said
afterward
i
oh
there
one
of
course
but
you
ll
never
know
the
assertion
laughingly
flung
out
six
months
earlier
in
a
bright
june
garden
came
back
to
mary
boyne
with
a
sharp
perception
of
its
latent
significance
as
she
stood
in
the
december
dusk
waiting
for
the
lamps
to
be
brought
into
the
library
the
words
had
been
spoken
by
their
friend
alida
stair
as
they
sat
at
tea
on
her
lawn
at
pangbourne
in
reference
to
the
very
house
of
which
the
library
in
question
was
the
central
the
pivotal
mary
boyne
and
her
husband
in
quest
of
a
country
place
in
one
of
the
southern
or
southwestern
counties
had
on
their
arrival
in
england
carried
their
problem
straight
to
alida
stair
who
had
successfully
solved
it
in
her
own
case
but
it
was
not
until
they
had
rejected
almost
capriciously
several
practical
and
judicious
suggestions
that
she
threw
it
out
well
there
s
lyng
in
dorsetshire
it
belongs
to
hugo
s
cousins
and
you
can
get
it
for
a
the
reasons
she
gave
for
its
being
obtainable
on
these
terms
its
remoteness
from
a
station
its
lack
of
electric
light
pipes
and
other
vulgar
necessities
were
exactly
those
pleading
in
its
favor
with
two
romantic
americans
perversely
in
search
of
the
economic
drawbacks
which
were
associated
in
their
tradition
with
unusual
architectural
felicities
i
should
never
believe
i
was
living
in
an
old
house
unless
i
was
thoroughly
uncomfortable
ned
boyne
the
more
extravagant
of
the
two
had
jocosely
insisted
the
least
hint
of
convenience
would
make
me
think
it
had
been
bought
out
of
an
exhibition
with
the
pieces
numbered
and
set
up
and
they
had
proceeded
to
enumerate
with
humorous
precision
their
various
suspicions
and
exactions
refusing
to
believe
that
the
house
their
cousin
recommended
was
tudor
till
they
learned
it
had
no
heating
system
or
that
the
village
church
was
literally
in
the
grounds
till
she
assured
them
of
the
deplorable
uncertainty
of
the
it
s
too
uncomfortable
to
be
true
edward
boyne
had
continued
to
exult
as
the
avowal
of
each
disadvantage
was
successively
wrung
from
her
but
he
had
cut
short
his
rhapsody
to
ask
with
a
sudden
relapse
to
distrust
and
the
ghost
you
ve
been
concealing
from
us
the
fact
that
there
is
no
ghost
mary
at
the
moment
had
laughed
with
him
yet
almost
with
her
laugh
being
possessed
of
several
sets
of
independent
perceptions
had
noted
a
sudden
flatness
of
tone
in
alida
s
answering
hilarity
oh
dorsetshire
s
full
of
ghosts
you
yes
yes
but
that
won
t
do
i
don
t
want
to
have
to
drive
ten
miles
to
see
somebody
else
s
ghost
i
want
one
of
my
own
on
the
premises
there
a
ghost
at
lyng
his
rejoinder
had
made
alida
laugh
again
and
it
was
then
that
she
had
flung
back
tantalizingly
oh
there
one
of
course
but
you
ll
never
know
never
know
it
boyne
pulled
her
up
but
what
in
the
world
constitutes
a
ghost
except
the
fact
of
its
being
known
for
one
i
can
t
say
but
that
s
the
that
there
s
a
ghost
but
that
nobody
knows
it
s
a
ghost
well
not
till
afterward
at
any
till
afterward
not
till
long
long
but
if
it
s
once
been
identified
as
an
unearthly
visitant
why
hasn
t
its
been
handed
down
in
the
family
how
has
it
managed
to
preserve
its
incognito
alida
could
only
shake
her
head
don
t
ask
me
but
it
and
then
suddenly
mary
spoke
up
as
if
from
some
cavernous
depth
of
divination
suddenly
long
afterward
one
says
to
one
s
self
that
it
she
was
oddly
startled
at
the
sepulchral
sound
with
which
her
question
fell
on
the
banter
of
the
other
two
and
she
saw
the
shadow
of
the
same
surprise
flit
across
alida
s
clear
pupils
i
suppose
so
one
just
has
to
oh
hang
waiting
ned
broke
in
life
s
too
short
for
a
ghost
who
can
only
be
enjoyed
in
retrospect
can
t
we
do
better
than
that
mary
but
it
turned
out
that
in
the
event
they
were
not
destined
to
for
within
three
months
of
their
conversation
with
stair
they
were
established
at
lyng
and
the
life
they
had
yearned
for
to
the
point
of
planning
it
out
in
all
its
daily
details
had
actually
begun
for
them
it
was
to
sit
in
the
thick
december
dusk
by
just
such
a
fireplace
under
just
such
black
oak
rafters
with
the
sense
that
beyond
the
mullioned
panes
the
downs
were
darkening
to
a
deeper
solitude
it
was
for
the
ultimate
indulgence
in
such
sensations
that
mary
boyne
had
endured
for
nearly
fourteen
years
the
ugliness
of
the
middle
west
and
that
boyne
had
ground
on
doggedly
at
his
engineering
till
with
a
suddenness
that
still
made
her
blink
the
prodigious
windfall
of
the
blue
star
mine
had
put
them
at
a
stroke
in
possession
of
life
and
the
leisure
to
taste
it
they
had
never
for
a
moment
meant
their
new
state
to
be
one
of
idleness
but
they
meant
to
give
themselves
only
to
harmonious
activities
she
had
her
vision
of
painting
and
gardening
against
a
background
of
gray
walls
he
dreamed
of
the
production
of
his
book
on
the
economic
basis
of
culture
and
with
such
absorbing
work
ahead
no
existence
could
be
too
sequestered
they
could
not
get
far
enough
from
the
world
or
plunge
deep
enough
into
the
past
dorsetshire
had
attracted
them
from
the
first
by
a
semblance
of
remoteness
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
geographical
position
but
to
the
boynes
it
was
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
whole
incredibly
compressed
island
a
nest
of
counties
as
they
put
it
that
for
the
production
of
its
effects
so
little
of
a
given
quality
went
so
far
that
so
few
miles
made
a
distance
and
so
short
a
distance
a
difference
it
s
that
ned
had
once
enthusiastically
explained
that
gives
such
depth
to
their
effects
such
relief
to
their
least
contrasts
they
ve
been
able
to
lay
the
butter
so
thick
on
every
exquisite
the
butter
had
certainly
been
laid
on
thick
at
lyng
the
old
gray
house
hidden
under
a
shoulder
of
the
downs
had
almost
all
the
finer
marks
of
commerce
with
a
protracted
past
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
neither
large
nor
exceptional
made
it
to
the
boynes
abound
the
more
richly
in
its
special
sense
the
sense
of
having
been
for
centuries
a
deep
dim
reservoir
of
life
the
life
had
probably
not
been
of
the
most
vivid
order
for
long
periods
no
doubt
it
had
fallen
as
noiselessly
into
the
past
as
the
quiet
drizzle
of
autumn
fell
hour
after
hour
into
the
green
between
the
yews
but
these
of
existence
sometimes
breed
in
their
sluggish
depths
strange
acuities
of
emotion
and
mary
boyne
had
felt
from
the
first
the
occasional
brush
of
an
intenser
memory
the
feeling
had
never
been
stronger
than
on
the
december
afternoon
when
waiting
in
the
library
for
the
belated
lamps
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
stood
among
the
shadows
of
the
hearth
her
husband
had
gone
off
after
luncheon
for
one
of
his
long
tramps
on
the
downs
she
had
noticed
of
late
that
he
preferred
to
be
unaccompanied
on
these
occasions
and
in
the
tried
security
of
their
personal
relations
had
been
driven
to
conclude
that
his
book
was
bothering
him
and
that
he
needed
the
afternoons
to
turn
over
in
solitude
the
problems
left
from
the
morning
s
work
certainly
the
book
was
not
going
as
smoothly
as
she
had
imagined
it
would
and
the
lines
of
perplexity
between
his
eyes
had
never
been
there
in
his
engineering
days
then
he
had
often
looked
fagged
to
the
verge
of
illness
but
the
native
demon
of
worry
had
never
branded
his
brow
yet
the
few
pages
he
had
so
far
read
to
her
the
introduction
and
a
synopsis
of
the
opening
chapter
gave
evidences
of
a
firm
possession
of
his
subject
and
a
deepening
confidence
in
his
powers
the
fact
threw
her
into
deeper
perplexity
since
now
that
he
had
done
with
business
and
its
disturbing
contingencies
the
one
other
possible
element
of
anxiety
was
eliminated
unless
it
were
his
health
then
but
physically
he
had
gained
since
they
had
come
to
dorsetshire
grown
robuster
ruddier
and
it
was
only
within
a
week
that
she
had
felt
in
him
the
undefinable
change
that
made
her
restless
in
his
absence
and
as
in
his
presence
as
though
it
were
who
had
a
secret
to
keep
from
him
the
thought
that
there
a
secret
somewhere
between
them
struck
her
with
a
sudden
smart
rap
of
wonder
and
she
looked
about
her
down
the
dim
long
room
can
it
be
the
house
she
mused
the
room
itself
might
have
been
full
of
secrets
they
seemed
to
be
piling
themselves
up
as
evening
fell
like
the
layers
and
layers
of
velvet
shadow
dropping
from
the
low
ceiling
the
dusky
walls
of
books
the
sculpture
of
the
hooded
hearth
why
of
course
the
house
is
haunted
she
reflected
the
ghost
alida
s
imperceptible
ghost
after
figuring
largely
in
the
banter
of
their
first
month
or
two
at
lyng
had
been
gradually
discarded
as
too
ineffectual
for
imaginative
use
mary
had
indeed
as
became
the
tenant
of
a
haunted
house
made
the
customary
inquiries
among
her
few
rural
neighbors
but
beyond
a
vague
they
du
say
so
ma
am
the
villagers
had
nothing
to
impart
the
elusive
specter
had
apparently
never
had
sufficient
identity
for
a
legend
to
crystallize
about
it
and
after
a
time
the
boynes
had
laughingly
set
the
matter
down
to
their
account
agreeing
that
lyng
was
one
of
the
few
houses
good
enough
in
itself
to
dispense
with
supernatural
enhancements
and
i
suppose
poor
ineffectual
demon
that
s
why
it
beats
its
beautiful
wings
in
vain
in
the
void
mary
had
laughingly
concluded
or
rather
ned
answered
in
the
same
strain
why
amid
so
much
that
s
ghostly
it
can
never
affirm
its
separate
existence
as
and
thereupon
their
invisible
housemate
had
finally
dropped
out
of
their
references
which
were
numerous
enough
to
make
them
promptly
unaware
of
the
loss
now
as
she
stood
on
the
hearth
the
subject
of
their
earlier
curiosity
revived
in
her
with
a
new
sense
of
its
meaning
a
sense
gradually
acquired
through
close
daily
contact
with
the
scene
of
the
lurking
mystery
it
was
the
house
itself
of
course
that
possessed
the
faculty
that
communed
visually
but
secretly
with
its
own
past
and
if
one
could
only
get
into
close
enough
communion
with
the
house
one
might
surprise
its
secret
and
acquire
the
on
one
s
own
account
perhaps
in
his
long
solitary
hours
in
this
very
room
where
she
never
trespassed
till
the
afternoon
her
husband
acquired
it
already
and
was
silently
carrying
the
dread
weight
of
whatever
it
had
revealed
to
him
mary
was
too
in
the
code
of
the
spectral
world
not
to
know
that
one
could
not
talk
about
the
ghosts
one
saw
to
do
so
was
almost
as
great
a
breach
of
as
to
name
a
lady
in
a
club
but
this
explanation
did
not
really
satisfy
her
what
after
all
except
for
the
fun
of
the
she
reflected
would
he
really
care
for
any
of
their
old
ghosts
and
thence
she
was
thrown
back
once
more
on
the
fundamental
dilemma
the
fact
that
one
s
greater
or
less
susceptibility
to
spectral
influences
had
no
particular
bearing
on
the
case
since
when
one
see
a
ghost
at
lyng
one
did
not
know
it
not
till
long
afterward
alida
stair
had
said
well
supposing
ned
seen
one
when
they
first
came
and
had
known
only
within
the
last
week
what
had
happened
to
him
more
and
more
under
the
spell
of
the
hour
she
threw
back
her
searching
thoughts
to
the
early
days
of
their
tenancy
but
at
first
only
to
recall
a
gay
confusion
of
unpacking
settling
arranging
of
books
and
calling
to
each
other
from
remote
corners
of
the
house
as
treasure
after
treasure
of
their
habitation
revealed
itself
to
them
it
was
in
this
particular
connection
that
she
presently
recalled
a
certain
soft
afternoon
of
the
previous
october
when
passing
from
the
first
rapturous
flurry
of
exploration
to
a
detailed
inspection
of
the
old
house
she
had
pressed
like
a
novel
heroine
a
panel
that
opened
at
her
touch
on
a
narrow
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
an
unsuspected
flat
ledge
of
the
roof
the
roof
which
from
below
seemed
to
slope
away
on
all
sides
too
abruptly
for
any
but
practised
feet
to
scale
the
view
from
this
hidden
coign
was
enchanting
and
she
had
flown
down
to
snatch
ned
from
his
papers
and
give
him
the
freedom
of
her
discovery
she
remembered
still
how
standing
on
the
narrow
ledge
he
had
passed
his
arm
about
her
while
their
gaze
flew
to
the
long
tossed
of
the
downs
and
then
dropped
contentedly
back
to
trace
the
arabesque
of
yew
hedges
about
the
and
the
shadow
of
the
cedar
on
the
lawn
and
now
the
other
way
he
had
said
gently
turning
her
about
within
his
arm
and
closely
pressed
to
him
she
had
absorbed
like
some
long
satisfying
draft
the
picture
of
the
court
the
squat
lions
on
the
gates
and
the
reaching
up
to
the
highroad
under
the
downs
it
was
just
then
while
they
gazed
and
held
each
other
that
she
had
felt
his
arm
relax
and
heard
a
sharp
hullo
that
made
her
turn
to
glance
at
him
distinctly
yes
she
now
recalled
she
had
seen
as
she
glanced
a
shadow
of
anxiety
of
perplexity
rather
fall
across
his
face
and
following
his
eyes
had
beheld
the
figure
of
a
man
a
man
in
loose
grayish
clothes
as
it
appeared
to
her
who
was
sauntering
down
the
to
the
court
with
the
tentative
gait
of
a
stranger
seeking
his
way
her
eyes
had
given
her
but
a
blurred
impression
of
slightness
and
grayness
with
something
foreign
or
at
least
unlocal
in
the
cut
of
the
figure
or
its
garb
but
her
husband
had
apparently
seen
more
seen
enough
to
make
him
push
past
her
with
a
sharp
wait
and
dash
down
the
twisting
stairs
without
pausing
to
give
her
a
hand
for
the
descent
a
slight
tendency
to
dizziness
obliged
her
after
a
provisional
clutch
at
the
chimney
against
which
they
had
been
leaning
to
follow
him
down
more
cautiously
and
when
she
had
reached
the
attic
landing
she
paused
again
for
a
less
definite
reason
leaning
over
the
oak
banister
to
strain
her
eyes
through
the
silence
of
the
brown
depths
below
she
lingered
there
till
somewhere
in
those
depths
she
heard
the
closing
of
a
door
then
mechanically
impelled
she
went
down
the
shallow
flights
of
steps
till
she
reached
the
lower
hall
the
front
door
stood
open
on
the
mild
sunlight
of
the
court
and
hall
and
court
were
empty
the
library
door
was
open
too
and
after
listening
in
vain
for
any
sound
of
voices
within
she
quickly
crossed
the
threshold
and
found
her
husband
alone
vaguely
fingering
the
papers
on
his
desk
he
looked
up
as
if
surprised
at
her
precipitate
entrance
but
the
shadow
of
anxiety
had
passed
from
his
face
leaving
it
even
as
she
fancied
a
little
brighter
and
clearer
than
usual
what
was
it
who
was
it
she
asked
who
he
repeated
with
the
surprise
still
all
on
his
side
the
man
we
saw
coming
toward
the
boyne
shrugged
his
shoulders
so
i
thought
but
he
must
have
got
up
steam
in
the
interval
what
do
you
say
to
our
trying
a
scramble
up
meldon
steep
before
sunset
that
was
all
at
the
time
the
occurrence
had
been
less
than
nothing
had
indeed
been
immediately
obliterated
by
the
magic
of
their
first
vision
from
meldon
steep
a
height
which
they
had
dreamed
of
climbing
ever
since
they
had
first
seen
its
bare
spine
heaving
itself
above
the
low
roof
of
lyng
doubtless
it
was
the
mere
fact
of
the
other
incident
s
having
occurred
on
the
very
day
of
their
ascent
to
meldon
that
had
kept
it
stored
away
in
the
unconscious
fold
of
association
from
which
it
now
emerged
for
in
itself
it
had
no
mark
of
the
portentous
at
the
moment
there
could
have
been
nothing
more
natural
than
that
ned
should
dash
himself
from
the
roof
in
the
pursuit
of
dilatory
tradesmen
it
was
the
period
when
they
were
always
on
the
watch
for
one
or
the
other
of
the
specialists
employed
about
the
place
always
lying
in
wait
for
them
and
dashing
out
at
them
with
questions
reproaches
or
reminders
and
certainly
in
the
distance
the
gray
figure
had
looked
like
peters
yet
now
as
she
reviewed
the
rapid
scene
she
felt
her
husband
s
explanation
of
it
to
have
been
invalidated
by
the
look
of
anxiety
on
his
face
why
had
the
familiar
appearance
of
peters
made
him
anxious
why
above
all
if
it
was
of
such
prime
necessity
to
confer
with
that
authority
on
the
subject
of
the
had
the
failure
to
find
him
produced
such
a
look
of
relief
mary
could
not
say
that
any
one
of
these
considerations
had
occurred
to
her
at
the
time
yet
from
the
promptness
with
which
they
now
marshaled
themselves
at
her
summons
she
had
a
sudden
sense
that
they
must
all
along
have
been
there
waiting
their
hour
ii
weary
with
her
thoughts
she
moved
toward
the
window
the
library
was
now
completely
dark
and
she
was
surprised
to
see
how
much
faint
light
the
outer
world
still
held
as
she
peered
out
into
it
across
the
court
a
figure
shaped
itself
in
the
tapering
perspective
of
bare
lines
it
looked
a
mere
blot
of
deeper
gray
in
the
grayness
and
for
an
instant
as
it
moved
toward
her
her
heart
thumped
to
the
thought
it
s
the
ghost
she
had
time
in
that
long
instant
to
feel
suddenly
that
the
man
of
whom
two
months
earlier
she
had
a
brief
distant
vision
from
the
roof
was
now
at
his
predestined
hour
about
to
reveal
himself
as
having
been
peters
and
her
spirit
sank
under
the
impending
fear
of
the
disclosure
but
almost
with
the
next
tick
of
the
clock
the
ambiguous
figure
gaining
substance
and
character
showed
itself
even
to
her
weak
sight
as
her
husband
s
and
she
turned
away
to
meet
him
as
he
entered
with
the
confession
of
her
folly
it
s
really
too
absurd
she
laughed
out
from
the
threshold
but
i
never
remember
remember
what
boyne
questioned
as
they
drew
together
that
when
one
sees
the
lyng
ghost
one
never
knows
her
hand
was
on
his
sleeve
and
he
kept
it
there
but
with
no
response
in
his
gesture
or
in
the
lines
of
his
fagged
preoccupied
face
did
you
think
you
d
seen
it
he
asked
after
an
appreciable
interval
why
i
actually
took
for
it
my
dear
in
my
mad
determination
to
spot
it
me
just
now
his
arm
dropped
away
and
he
turned
from
her
with
a
faint
echo
of
her
laugh
really
dearest
you
d
better
give
it
up
if
that
s
the
best
you
can
yes
i
give
it
up
i
give
it
up
have
she
asked
turning
round
on
him
abruptly
the
had
entered
with
letters
and
a
lamp
and
the
light
struck
up
into
boyne
s
face
as
he
bent
above
the
tray
she
presented
have
mary
perversely
insisted
when
the
servant
had
disappeared
on
her
errand
of
illumination
have
i
what
he
rejoined
absently
the
light
bringing
out
the
sharp
stamp
of
worry
between
his
brows
as
he
turned
over
the
letters
i
never
tried
he
said
tearing
open
the
wrapper
of
a
newspaper
well
of
course
mary
persisted
the
exasperating
thing
is
that
there
s
no
use
trying
since
one
can
t
be
sure
till
so
long
he
was
unfolding
the
paper
as
if
he
had
hardly
heard
her
but
after
a
pause
during
which
the
sheets
rustled
spasmodically
between
his
hands
he
lifted
his
head
to
say
abruptly
have
you
any
idea
long
mary
had
sunk
into
a
low
chair
beside
the
fireplace
from
her
seat
she
looked
up
startled
at
her
husband
s
profile
which
was
darkly
projected
against
the
circle
of
lamplight
no
none
have
she
retorted
repeating
her
former
phrase
with
an
added
keenness
of
intention
boyne
crumpled
the
paper
into
a
bunch
and
then
inconsequently
turned
back
with
it
toward
the
lamp
lord
no
i
only
meant
he
explained
with
a
faint
tinge
of
impatience
is
there
any
legend
any
tradition
as
to
that
not
that
i
know
of
she
answered
but
the
impulse
to
add
what
makes
you
ask
was
checked
by
the
reappearance
of
the
with
tea
and
a
second
lamp
with
the
dispersal
of
shadows
and
the
repetition
of
the
daily
domestic
office
mary
boyne
felt
herself
less
oppressed
by
that
sense
of
something
mutely
imminent
which
had
darkened
her
solitary
afternoon
for
a
few
moments
she
gave
herself
silently
to
the
details
of
her
task
and
when
she
looked
up
from
it
she
was
struck
to
the
point
of
bewilderment
by
the
change
in
her
husband
s
face
he
had
seated
himself
near
the
farther
lamp
and
was
absorbed
in
the
perusal
of
his
letters
but
was
it
something
he
had
found
in
them
or
merely
the
shifting
of
her
own
point
of
view
that
had
restored
his
features
to
their
normal
aspect
the
longer
she
looked
the
more
definitely
the
change
affirmed
itself
the
lines
of
painful
tension
had
vanished
and
such
traces
of
fatigue
as
lingered
were
of
the
kind
easily
attributable
to
steady
mental
effort
he
glanced
up
as
if
drawn
by
her
gaze
and
met
her
eyes
with
a
smile
i
m
dying
for
my
tea
you
know
and
here
s
a
letter
for
you
he
said
she
took
the
letter
he
held
out
in
exchange
for
the
cup
she
proffered
him
and
returning
to
her
seat
broke
the
seal
with
the
languid
gesture
of
the
reader
whose
interests
are
all
inclosed
in
the
circle
of
one
cherished
presence
her
next
conscious
motion
was
that
of
starting
to
her
feet
the
letter
falling
to
them
as
she
rose
while
she
held
out
to
her
husband
a
long
newspaper
clipping
ned
what
s
this
what
does
it
mean
he
had
risen
at
the
same
instant
almost
as
if
hearing
her
cry
before
she
uttered
it
and
for
a
perceptible
space
of
time
he
and
she
studied
each
other
like
adversaries
watching
for
an
advantage
across
the
space
between
her
chair
and
his
desk
what
s
what
you
fairly
made
me
jump
boyne
said
at
length
moving
toward
her
with
a
sudden
laugh
the
shadow
of
apprehension
was
on
his
face
again
not
now
a
look
of
fixed
foreboding
but
a
shifting
vigilance
of
lips
and
eyes
that
gave
her
the
sense
of
his
feeling
himself
invisibly
surrounded
her
hand
shook
so
that
she
could
hardly
give
him
the
clipping
this
article
from
the
waukesha
sentinel
that
a
man
named
elwell
has
brought
suit
against
you
that
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
blue
star
mine
i
can
t
understand
more
than
they
continued
to
face
each
other
as
she
spoke
and
to
her
astonishment
she
saw
that
her
words
had
the
almost
immediate
effect
of
dissipating
the
strained
watchfulness
of
his
look
oh
he
glanced
down
the
printed
slip
and
then
folded
it
with
the
gesture
of
one
who
handles
something
harmless
and
familiar
what
s
the
matter
with
you
this
afternoon
mary
i
thought
you
d
got
bad
she
stood
before
him
with
her
undefinable
terror
subsiding
slowly
under
the
reassuring
touch
of
his
composure
you
knew
about
this
then
it
s
all
right
certainly
i
knew
about
it
and
it
s
all
but
what
it
i
don
t
understand
what
does
this
man
accuse
you
of
oh
pretty
nearly
every
crime
in
the
boyne
had
tossed
the
clipping
down
and
thrown
himself
comfortably
into
an
near
the
fire
do
you
want
to
hear
the
story
it
s
not
particularly
interesting
just
a
squabble
over
interests
in
the
blue
but
who
is
this
elwell
i
don
t
know
the
oh
he
s
a
fellow
i
put
into
it
gave
him
a
hand
up
i
told
you
all
about
him
at
the
i
daresay
i
must
have
vainly
she
strained
back
among
her
memories
but
if
you
helped
him
why
does
he
make
this
return
oh
probably
some
shyster
lawyer
got
hold
of
him
and
talked
him
over
it
s
all
rather
technical
and
complicated
i
thought
that
kind
of
thing
bored
his
wife
felt
a
sting
of
compunction
theoretically
she
deprecated
the
american
wife
s
detachment
from
her
husband
s
professional
interests
but
in
practice
she
had
always
found
it
difficult
to
fix
her
attention
on
boyne
s
report
of
the
transactions
in
which
his
varied
interests
involved
him
besides
she
had
felt
from
the
first
that
in
a
community
where
the
amenities
of
living
could
be
obtained
only
at
the
cost
of
efforts
as
arduous
as
her
husband
s
professional
labors
such
brief
leisure
as
they
could
command
should
be
used
as
an
escape
from
immediate
preoccupations
a
flight
to
the
life
they
always
dreamed
of
living
once
or
twice
now
that
this
new
life
had
actually
drawn
its
magic
circle
about
them
she
had
asked
herself
if
she
had
done
right
but
hitherto
such
conjectures
had
been
no
more
than
the
retrospective
excursions
of
an
active
fancy
now
for
the
first
time
it
startled
her
a
little
to
find
how
little
she
knew
of
the
material
foundation
on
which
her
happiness
was
built
she
glanced
again
at
her
husband
and
was
reassured
by
the
composure
of
his
face
yet
she
felt
the
need
of
more
definite
grounds
for
her
reassurance
but
doesn
t
this
suit
worry
you
why
have
you
never
spoken
to
me
about
it
he
answered
both
questions
at
once
i
didn
t
speak
of
it
at
first
because
it
worry
me
annoyed
me
rather
but
it
s
all
ancient
history
now
your
correspondent
must
have
got
hold
of
a
back
number
of
the
she
felt
a
quick
thrill
of
relief
you
mean
it
s
over
he
s
lost
his
case
there
was
a
just
perceptible
delay
in
boyne
s
reply
the
suit
s
been
withdrawn
that
s
but
she
persisted
as
if
to
exonerate
herself
from
the
inward
charge
of
being
too
easily
put
off
withdrawn
because
he
saw
he
had
no
chance
oh
he
had
no
chance
boyne
answered
she
was
still
struggling
with
a
dimly
felt
perplexity
at
the
back
of
her
thoughts
how
long
ago
was
it
withdrawn
he
paused
as
if
with
a
slight
return
of
his
former
uncertainty
i
ve
just
had
the
news
now
but
i
ve
been
expecting
just
now
in
one
of
your
letters
yes
in
one
of
my
she
made
no
answer
and
was
aware
only
after
a
short
interval
of
waiting
that
he
had
risen
and
strolling
across
the
room
had
placed
himself
on
the
sofa
at
her
side
she
felt
him
as
he
did
so
pass
an
arm
about
her
she
felt
his
hand
seek
hers
and
clasp
it
and
turning
slowly
drawn
by
the
warmth
of
his
cheek
she
met
the
smiling
clearness
of
his
eyes
it
s
all
right
it
s
all
right
she
questioned
through
the
flood
of
her
dissolving
doubts
and
i
give
you
my
word
it
never
was
righter
he
laughed
back
at
her
holding
her
close
iii
one
of
the
strangest
things
she
was
afterward
to
recall
out
of
all
the
next
day
s
incredible
strangeness
was
the
sudden
and
complete
recovery
of
her
sense
of
security
it
was
in
the
air
when
she
woke
in
her
dusky
room
it
accompanied
her
to
the
flashed
out
at
her
from
the
fire
and
itself
brightly
from
the
flanks
of
the
urn
and
the
sturdy
flutings
of
the
georgian
teapot
it
was
as
if
in
some
roundabout
way
all
her
diffused
apprehensions
of
the
previous
day
with
their
moment
of
sharp
concentration
about
the
newspaper
article
as
if
this
dim
questioning
of
the
future
and
startled
return
upon
the
past
had
between
them
liquidated
the
arrears
of
some
haunting
moral
obligation
if
she
had
indeed
been
careless
of
her
husband
s
affairs
it
was
her
new
state
seemed
to
prove
because
her
faith
in
him
instinctively
justified
such
carelessness
and
his
right
to
her
faith
had
overwhelmingly
affirmed
itself
in
the
very
face
of
menace
and
suspicion
she
had
never
seen
him
more
untroubled
more
naturally
and
unconsciously
in
possession
of
himself
than
after
the
to
which
she
had
subjected
him
it
was
almost
as
if
he
had
been
aware
of
her
lurking
doubts
and
had
wanted
the
air
cleared
as
much
as
she
did
it
was
as
clear
thank
heaven
as
the
bright
outer
light
that
surprised
her
almost
with
a
touch
of
summer
when
she
issued
from
the
house
for
her
daily
round
of
the
gardens
she
had
left
boyne
at
his
desk
indulging
herself
as
she
passed
the
library
door
by
a
last
peep
at
his
quiet
face
where
he
bent
pipe
in
his
mouth
above
his
papers
and
now
she
had
her
own
morning
s
task
to
perform
the
task
involved
on
such
charmed
winter
days
almost
as
much
delighted
loitering
about
the
different
quarters
of
her
demesne
as
if
spring
were
already
at
work
on
shrubs
and
borders
there
were
such
inexhaustible
possibilities
still
before
her
such
opportunities
to
bring
out
the
latent
graces
of
the
old
place
without
a
single
irreverent
touch
of
alteration
that
the
winter
months
were
all
too
short
to
plan
what
spring
and
autumn
executed
and
her
recovered
sense
of
safety
gave
on
this
particular
morning
a
peculiar
zest
to
her
progress
through
the
sweet
still
place
she
went
first
to
the
where
the
espaliered
drew
complicated
patterns
on
the
walls
and
pigeons
were
fluttering
and
preening
about
the
roof
of
their
cot
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
piping
of
the
hothouse
and
she
was
expecting
an
authority
from
dorchester
who
was
to
drive
out
between
trains
and
make
a
diagnosis
of
the
boiler
but
when
she
dipped
into
the
damp
heat
of
the
greenhouses
among
the
spiced
scents
and
waxy
pinks
and
reds
of
exotics
even
the
flora
of
lyng
was
in
the
note
she
learned
that
the
great
man
had
not
arrived
and
the
day
being
too
rare
to
waste
in
an
artificial
atmosphere
she
came
out
again
and
paced
slowly
along
the
springy
turf
of
the
to
the
gardens
behind
the
house
at
their
farther
end
rose
a
grass
terrace
commanding
over
the
and
the
yew
hedges
a
view
of
the
long
with
its
twisted
and
the
blue
shadows
of
its
roof
angles
all
drenched
in
the
pale
gold
moisture
of
the
air
seen
thus
across
the
level
tracery
of
the
yews
under
the
suffused
mild
light
it
sent
her
from
its
open
windows
and
hospitably
smoking
chimneys
the
look
of
some
warm
human
presence
of
a
mind
slowly
ripened
on
a
sunny
wall
of
experience
she
had
never
before
had
so
deep
a
sense
of
her
intimacy
with
it
such
a
conviction
that
its
secrets
were
all
beneficent
kept
as
they
said
to
children
for
one
s
good
so
complete
a
trust
in
its
power
to
gather
up
her
life
and
ned
s
into
the
harmonious
pattern
of
the
long
long
story
it
sat
there
weaving
in
the
sun
she
heard
steps
behind
her
and
turned
expecting
to
see
the
gardener
accompanied
by
the
engineer
from
dorchester
but
only
one
figure
was
in
sight
that
of
a
youngish
slightly
built
man
who
for
reasons
she
could
not
on
the
spot
have
specified
did
not
remotely
resemble
her
preconceived
notion
of
an
authority
on
boilers
the
on
seeing
her
lifted
his
hat
and
paused
with
the
air
of
a
gentleman
perhaps
a
traveler
desirous
of
having
it
immediately
known
that
his
intrusion
is
involuntary
the
local
fame
of
lyng
occasionally
attracted
the
more
intelligent
and
mary
to
see
the
stranger
dissemble
a
camera
or
justify
his
presence
by
producing
it
but
he
made
no
gesture
of
any
sort
and
after
a
moment
she
asked
in
a
tone
responding
to
the
courteous
deprecation
of
his
attitude
is
there
any
one
you
wish
to
see
i
came
to
see
boyne
he
replied
his
intonation
rather
than
his
accent
was
faintly
american
and
mary
at
the
familiar
note
looked
at
him
more
closely
the
brim
of
his
soft
felt
hat
cast
a
shade
on
his
face
which
thus
obscured
wore
to
her
gaze
a
look
of
seriousness
as
of
a
person
arriving
on
business
and
civilly
but
firmly
aware
of
his
rights
past
experience
had
made
mary
equally
sensible
to
such
claims
but
she
was
jealous
of
her
husband
s
morning
hours
and
doubtful
of
his
having
given
any
one
the
right
to
intrude
on
them
have
you
an
appointment
with
boyne
she
asked
he
hesitated
as
if
unprepared
for
the
question
not
exactly
an
appointment
he
replied
then
i
m
afraid
this
being
his
that
he
can
t
receive
you
now
will
you
give
me
a
message
or
come
back
later
the
visitor
again
lifting
his
hat
briefly
replied
that
he
would
come
back
later
and
walked
away
as
if
to
regain
the
front
of
the
house
as
his
figure
receded
down
the
walk
between
the
yew
hedges
mary
saw
him
pause
and
look
up
an
instant
at
the
peaceful
bathed
in
faint
winter
sunshine
and
it
struck
her
with
a
tardy
touch
of
compunction
that
it
would
have
been
more
humane
to
ask
if
he
had
come
from
a
distance
and
to
offer
in
that
case
to
inquire
if
her
husband
could
receive
him
but
as
the
thought
occurred
to
her
he
passed
out
of
sight
behind
a
pyramidal
yew
and
at
the
same
moment
her
attention
was
distracted
by
the
approach
of
the
gardener
attended
by
the
bearded
figure
of
the
from
dorchester
the
encounter
with
this
authority
led
to
such
issues
that
they
resulted
in
his
finding
it
expedient
to
ignore
his
train
and
beguiled
mary
into
spending
the
remainder
of
the
morning
in
absorbed
confabulation
among
the
greenhouses
she
was
startled
to
find
when
the
colloquy
ended
that
it
was
nearly
and
she
half
expected
as
she
hurried
back
to
the
house
to
see
her
husband
coming
out
to
meet
her
but
she
found
no
one
in
the
court
but
an
raking
the
gravel
and
the
hall
when
she
entered
it
was
so
silent
that
she
guessed
boyne
to
be
still
at
work
behind
the
closed
door
of
the
library
not
wishing
to
disturb
him
she
turned
into
the
and
there
at
her
lost
herself
in
renewed
calculations
of
the
outlay
to
which
the
morning
s
conference
had
committed
her
the
knowledge
that
she
could
permit
herself
such
follies
had
not
yet
lost
its
novelty
and
somehow
in
contrast
to
the
vague
apprehensions
of
the
previous
days
it
now
seemed
an
element
of
her
recovered
security
of
the
sense
that
as
ned
had
said
things
in
general
had
never
been
she
was
still
luxuriating
in
a
lavish
play
of
figures
when
the
from
the
threshold
roused
her
with
a
dubiously
worded
inquiry
as
to
the
expediency
of
serving
luncheon
it
was
one
of
their
jokes
that
trimmle
announced
luncheon
as
if
she
were
divulging
a
state
secret
and
mary
intent
upon
her
papers
merely
murmured
an
assent
she
felt
trimmle
wavering
expressively
on
the
threshold
as
if
in
rebuke
of
such
offhand
acquiescence
then
her
retreating
steps
sounded
down
the
passage
and
mary
pushing
away
her
papers
crossed
the
hall
and
went
to
the
library
door
it
was
still
closed
and
she
wavered
in
her
turn
disliking
to
disturb
her
husband
yet
anxious
that
he
should
not
exceed
his
normal
measure
of
work
as
she
stood
there
balancing
her
impulses
the
esoteric
trimmle
returned
with
the
announcement
of
luncheon
and
mary
thus
impelled
opened
the
door
and
went
into
the
library
boyne
was
not
at
his
desk
and
she
peered
about
her
expecting
to
discover
him
at
the
somewhere
down
the
length
of
the
room
but
her
call
brought
no
response
and
gradually
it
became
clear
to
her
that
he
was
not
in
the
library
she
turned
back
to
the
mr
boyne
must
be
please
tell
him
that
luncheon
is
the
appeared
to
hesitate
between
the
obvious
duty
of
obeying
orders
and
an
equally
obvious
conviction
of
the
foolishness
of
the
injunction
laid
upon
her
the
struggle
resulted
in
her
saying
doubtfully
if
you
please
madam
boyne
s
not
not
in
his
room
are
you
sure
i
m
sure
mary
consulted
the
clock
where
is
he
then
he
s
gone
out
trimmle
announced
with
the
superior
air
of
one
who
has
respectfully
waited
for
the
question
that
a
mind
would
have
first
propounded
mary
s
previous
conjecture
had
been
right
then
boyne
must
have
gone
to
the
gardens
to
meet
her
and
since
she
had
missed
him
it
was
clear
that
he
had
taken
the
shorter
way
by
the
south
door
instead
of
going
round
to
the
court
she
crossed
the
hall
to
the
glass
portal
opening
directly
on
the
yew
garden
but
the
after
another
moment
of
inner
conflict
decided
to
bring
out
recklessly
please
madam
boyne
didn
t
go
that
mary
turned
back
where
he
go
and
when
he
went
out
of
the
front
door
up
the
drive
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
with
trimmle
never
to
answer
more
than
one
question
at
a
time
up
the
drive
at
this
hour
mary
went
to
the
door
herself
and
glanced
across
the
court
through
the
long
tunnel
of
bare
limes
but
its
perspective
was
as
empty
as
when
she
had
scanned
it
on
entering
the
house
did
boyne
leave
no
message
she
asked
trimmle
seemed
to
surrender
herself
to
a
last
struggle
with
the
forces
of
chaos
no
madam
he
just
went
out
with
the
the
gentleman
what
gentleman
mary
wheeled
about
as
if
to
front
this
new
factor
the
gentleman
who
called
madam
said
trimmle
resignedly
when
did
a
gentleman
call
do
explain
yourself
trimmle
only
the
fact
that
mary
was
very
hungry
and
that
she
wanted
to
consult
her
husband
about
the
greenhouses
would
have
caused
her
to
lay
so
unusual
an
injunction
on
her
attendant
and
even
now
she
was
detached
enough
to
note
in
trimmle
s
eye
the
dawning
defiance
of
the
respectful
subordinate
who
has
been
pressed
too
hard
i
couldn
t
exactly
say
the
hour
madam
because
i
didn
t
let
the
gentleman
in
she
replied
with
the
air
of
magnanimously
ignoring
the
irregularity
of
her
mistress
s
course
you
didn
t
let
him
in
no
madam
when
the
bell
rang
i
was
dressing
and
agnes
go
and
ask
agnes
then
mary
interjected
trimmle
still
wore
her
look
of
patient
magnanimity
agnes
would
not
know
madam
for
she
had
unfortunately
burnt
her
hand
in
trying
the
wick
of
the
new
lamp
from
town
trimmle
as
mary
was
aware
had
always
been
opposed
to
the
new
lamp
and
so
dockett
sent
the
mary
looked
again
at
the
clock
it
s
after
two
go
and
ask
the
if
boyne
left
any
she
went
into
luncheon
without
waiting
and
trimmle
presently
brought
her
there
the
s
statement
that
the
gentleman
had
called
about
one
o
clock
that
boyne
had
gone
out
with
him
without
leaving
any
message
the
did
not
even
know
the
caller
s
name
for
he
had
written
it
on
a
slip
of
paper
which
he
had
folded
and
handed
to
her
with
the
injunction
to
deliver
it
at
once
to
boyne
mary
finished
her
luncheon
still
wondering
and
when
it
was
over
and
trimmle
had
brought
the
coffee
to
the
her
wonder
had
deepened
to
a
first
faint
tinge
of
disquietude
it
was
unlike
boyne
to
absent
himself
without
explanation
at
so
unwonted
an
hour
and
the
difficulty
of
identifying
the
visitor
whose
summons
he
had
apparently
obeyed
made
his
disappearance
the
more
unaccountable
mary
boyne
s
experience
as
the
wife
of
a
busy
engineer
subject
to
sudden
calls
and
compelled
to
keep
irregular
hours
had
trained
her
to
the
philosophic
acceptance
of
surprises
but
since
boyne
s
withdrawal
from
business
he
had
adopted
a
benedictine
regularity
of
life
as
if
to
make
up
for
the
dispersed
and
agitated
years
with
their
lunches
and
dinners
rattled
down
to
the
joltings
of
the
he
cultivated
the
last
refinements
of
punctuality
and
monotony
discouraging
his
wife
s
fancy
for
the
unexpected
and
declaring
that
to
a
delicate
taste
there
were
infinite
gradations
of
pleasure
in
the
fixed
recurrences
of
habit
still
since
no
life
can
completely
defend
itself
from
the
unforeseen
it
was
evident
that
all
boyne
s
precautions
would
sooner
or
later
prove
unavailable
and
mary
concluded
that
he
had
cut
short
a
tiresome
visit
by
walking
with
his
caller
to
the
station
or
at
least
accompanying
him
for
part
of
the
way
this
conclusion
relieved
her
from
farther
preoccupation
and
she
went
out
herself
to
take
up
her
conference
with
the
gardener
thence
she
walked
to
the
village
a
mile
or
so
away
and
when
she
turned
toward
home
the
early
twilight
was
setting
in
she
had
taken
a
across
the
downs
and
as
boyne
meanwhile
had
probably
returned
from
the
station
by
the
highroad
there
was
little
likelihood
of
their
meeting
on
the
way
she
felt
sure
however
of
his
having
reached
the
house
before
her
so
sure
that
when
she
entered
it
herself
without
even
pausing
to
inquire
of
trimmle
she
made
directly
for
the
library
but
the
library
was
still
empty
and
with
an
unwonted
precision
of
visual
memory
she
immediately
observed
that
the
papers
on
her
husband
s
desk
lay
precisely
as
they
had
lain
when
she
had
gone
in
to
call
him
to
luncheon
then
of
a
sudden
she
was
seized
by
a
vague
dread
of
the
unknown
she
had
closed
the
door
behind
her
on
entering
and
as
she
stood
alone
in
the
long
silent
shadowy
room
her
dread
seemed
to
take
shape
and
sound
to
be
there
audibly
breathing
and
lurking
among
the
shadows
her
eyes
strained
through
them
an
actual
presence
something
aloof
that
watched
and
knew
and
in
the
recoil
from
that
intangible
propinquity
she
threw
herself
suddenly
on
the
and
gave
it
a
desperate
pull
the
long
quavering
summons
brought
trimmle
in
precipitately
with
a
lamp
and
mary
breathed
again
at
this
sobering
reappearance
of
the
usual
you
may
bring
tea
if
boyne
is
in
she
said
to
justify
her
ring
very
well
madam
but
boyne
is
not
in
said
trimmle
putting
down
the
lamp
not
in
you
mean
he
s
come
back
and
gone
out
again
no
madam
he
s
never
been
the
dread
stirred
again
and
mary
knew
that
now
it
had
her
fast
not
since
he
went
out
with
the
gentleman
not
since
he
went
out
with
the
but
who
the
gentleman
mary
gasped
out
with
the
sharp
note
of
some
one
trying
to
be
heard
through
a
confusion
of
meaningless
noises
that
i
couldn
t
say
trimmle
standing
there
by
the
lamp
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
less
round
and
rosy
as
though
eclipsed
by
the
same
creeping
shade
of
apprehension
but
the
knows
wasn
t
it
the
who
let
him
in
she
doesn
t
know
either
madam
for
he
wrote
his
name
on
a
folded
mary
through
her
agitation
was
aware
that
they
were
both
designating
the
unknown
visitor
by
a
vague
pronoun
instead
of
the
conventional
formula
which
till
then
had
kept
their
allusions
within
the
bounds
of
custom
and
at
the
same
moment
her
mind
caught
at
the
suggestion
of
the
folded
paper
but
he
must
have
a
name
where
is
the
paper
she
moved
to
the
desk
and
began
to
turn
over
the
scattered
documents
that
littered
it
the
first
that
caught
her
eye
was
an
unfinished
letter
in
her
husband
s
hand
with
his
pen
lying
across
it
as
though
dropped
there
at
a
sudden
summons
my
dear
parvis
who
was
parvis
i
have
just
received
your
letter
announcing
elwell
s
death
and
while
i
suppose
there
is
now
no
farther
risk
of
trouble
it
might
be
safer
she
tossed
the
sheet
aside
and
continued
her
search
but
no
folded
paper
was
discoverable
among
the
letters
and
pages
of
manuscript
which
had
been
swept
together
in
a
promiscuous
heap
as
if
by
a
hurried
or
a
startled
gesture
but
the
him
send
her
here
she
commanded
wondering
at
her
dullness
in
not
thinking
sooner
of
so
simple
a
solution
trimmle
at
the
behest
vanished
in
a
flash
as
if
thankful
to
be
out
of
the
room
and
when
she
reappeared
conducting
the
agitated
underling
mary
had
regained
her
and
had
her
questions
pat
the
gentleman
was
a
stranger
yes
that
she
understood
but
what
had
he
said
and
above
all
what
had
he
looked
like
the
first
question
was
easily
enough
answered
for
the
disconcerting
reason
that
he
had
said
so
little
had
merely
asked
for
boyne
and
scribbling
something
on
a
bit
of
paper
had
requested
that
it
should
at
once
be
carried
in
to
him
then
you
don
t
know
what
he
wrote
you
re
not
sure
it
his
name
the
was
not
sure
but
supposed
it
was
since
he
had
written
it
in
answer
to
her
inquiry
as
to
whom
she
should
announce
and
when
you
carried
the
paper
in
to
boyne
what
did
he
say
the
did
not
think
that
boyne
had
said
anything
but
she
could
not
be
sure
for
just
as
she
had
handed
him
the
paper
and
he
was
opening
it
she
had
become
aware
that
the
visitor
had
followed
her
into
the
library
and
she
had
slipped
out
leaving
the
two
gentlemen
together
but
then
if
you
left
them
in
the
library
how
do
you
know
that
they
went
out
of
the
house
this
question
plunged
the
witness
into
momentary
inarticulateness
from
which
she
was
rescued
by
trimmle
who
by
means
of
ingenious
circumlocutions
elicited
the
statement
that
before
she
could
cross
the
hall
to
the
back
passage
she
had
heard
the
gentlemen
behind
her
and
had
seen
them
go
out
of
the
front
door
together
then
if
you
saw
the
gentleman
twice
you
must
be
able
to
tell
me
what
he
looked
but
with
this
final
challenge
to
her
powers
of
expression
it
became
clear
that
the
limit
of
the
s
endurance
had
been
reached
the
obligation
of
going
to
the
front
door
to
show
in
a
visitor
was
in
itself
so
subversive
of
the
fundamental
order
of
things
that
it
had
thrown
her
faculties
into
hopeless
disarray
and
she
could
only
stammer
out
after
various
panting
efforts
at
evocation
his
hat
mum
was
as
you
might
say
different
how
different
mary
flashed
out
at
her
her
own
mind
in
the
same
instant
leaping
back
to
an
image
left
on
it
that
morning
but
temporarily
lost
under
layers
of
subsequent
impressions
his
hat
had
a
wide
brim
you
mean
and
his
face
was
pale
a
youngish
face
mary
pressed
her
with
a
intensity
of
interrogation
but
if
the
found
any
adequate
answer
to
this
challenge
it
was
swept
away
for
her
listener
down
the
rushing
current
of
her
own
convictions
the
stranger
the
stranger
in
the
garden
why
had
mary
not
thought
of
him
before
she
needed
no
one
now
to
tell
her
that
it
was
he
who
had
called
for
her
husband
and
gone
away
with
him
but
who
was
he
and
why
had
boyne
obeyed
his
call
iv
it
leaped
out
at
her
suddenly
like
a
grin
out
of
the
dark
that
they
had
often
called
england
so
little
such
a
confoundedly
hard
place
to
get
lost
confoundedly
hard
place
to
get
lost
in
that
had
been
her
husband
s
phrase
and
now
with
the
whole
machinery
of
official
investigation
sweeping
its
from
shore
to
shore
and
across
the
dividing
straits
now
with
boyne
s
name
blazing
from
the
walls
of
every
town
and
village
his
portrait
how
that
wrung
her
hawked
up
and
down
the
country
like
the
image
of
a
hunted
criminal
now
the
little
compact
populous
island
so
policed
surveyed
and
administered
revealed
itself
as
a
guardian
of
abysmal
mysteries
staring
back
into
his
wife
s
anguished
eyes
as
if
with
the
malicious
joy
of
knowing
something
they
would
never
know
in
the
fortnight
since
boyne
s
disappearance
there
had
been
no
word
of
him
no
trace
of
his
movements
even
the
usual
misleading
reports
that
raise
expectancy
in
tortured
bosoms
had
been
few
and
fleeting
no
one
but
the
bewildered
had
seen
him
leave
the
house
and
no
one
else
had
seen
the
gentleman
who
accompanied
him
all
inquiries
in
the
neighborhood
failed
to
elicit
the
memory
of
a
stranger
s
presence
that
day
in
the
neighborhood
of
lyng
and
no
one
had
met
edward
boyne
either
alone
or
in
company
in
any
of
the
neighboring
villages
or
on
the
road
across
the
downs
or
at
either
of
the
local
the
sunny
english
noon
had
swallowed
him
as
completely
as
if
he
had
gone
out
into
cimmerian
night
mary
while
every
external
means
of
investigation
was
working
at
its
highest
pressure
had
ransacked
her
husband
s
papers
for
any
trace
of
antecedent
complications
of
entanglements
or
obligations
unknown
to
her
that
might
throw
a
faint
ray
into
the
darkness
but
if
any
such
had
existed
in
the
background
of
boyne
s
life
they
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
the
slip
of
paper
on
which
the
visitor
had
written
his
name
there
remained
no
possible
thread
of
guidance
except
if
it
were
indeed
an
exception
the
letter
which
boyne
had
apparently
been
in
the
act
of
writing
when
he
received
his
mysterious
summons
that
letter
read
and
reread
by
his
wife
and
submitted
by
her
to
the
police
yielded
little
enough
for
conjecture
to
feed
on
i
have
just
heard
of
elwell
s
death
and
while
i
suppose
there
is
now
no
farther
risk
of
trouble
it
might
be
safer
that
was
all
the
risk
of
trouble
was
easily
explained
by
the
newspaper
clipping
which
had
apprised
mary
of
the
suit
brought
against
her
husband
by
one
of
his
associates
in
the
blue
star
enterprise
the
only
new
information
conveyed
in
the
letter
was
the
fact
of
its
showing
boyne
when
he
wrote
it
to
be
still
apprehensive
of
the
results
of
the
suit
though
he
had
assured
his
wife
that
it
had
been
withdrawn
and
though
the
letter
itself
declared
that
the
plaintiff
was
dead
it
took
several
weeks
of
exhaustive
cabling
to
fix
the
identity
of
the
parvis
to
whom
the
fragmentary
communication
was
addressed
but
even
after
these
inquiries
had
shown
him
to
be
a
waukesha
lawyer
no
new
facts
concerning
the
elwell
suit
were
elicited
he
appeared
to
have
had
no
direct
concern
in
it
but
to
have
been
conversant
with
the
facts
merely
as
an
acquaintance
and
possible
intermediary
and
he
declared
himself
unable
to
divine
with
what
object
boyne
intended
to
seek
his
assistance
this
negative
information
sole
fruit
of
the
first
fortnight
s
feverish
search
was
not
increased
by
a
jot
during
the
slow
weeks
that
followed
mary
knew
that
the
investigations
were
still
being
carried
on
but
she
had
a
vague
sense
of
their
gradually
slackening
as
the
actual
march
of
time
seemed
to
slacken
it
was
as
though
the
days
flying
from
the
shrouded
image
of
the
one
inscrutable
day
gained
assurance
as
the
distance
lengthened
till
at
last
they
fell
back
into
their
normal
gait
and
so
with
the
human
imaginations
at
work
on
the
dark
event
no
doubt
it
occupied
them
still
but
week
by
week
and
hour
by
hour
it
grew
less
absorbing
took
up
less
space
was
slowly
but
inevitably
crowded
out
of
the
foreground
of
consciousness
by
the
new
problems
perpetually
bubbling
up
from
the
vaporous
caldron
of
human
experience
even
mary
boyne
s
consciousness
gradually
felt
the
same
lowering
of
velocity
it
still
swayed
with
the
incessant
oscillations
of
conjecture
but
they
were
slower
more
rhythmical
in
their
beat
there
were
moments
of
overwhelming
lassitude
when
like
the
victim
of
some
poison
which
leaves
the
brain
clear
but
holds
the
body
motionless
she
saw
herself
domesticated
with
the
horror
accepting
its
perpetual
presence
as
one
of
the
fixed
conditions
of
life
these
moments
lengthened
into
hours
and
days
till
she
passed
into
a
phase
of
stolid
acquiescence
she
watched
the
familiar
routine
of
life
with
the
incurious
eye
of
a
savage
on
whom
the
meaningless
processes
of
civilization
make
but
the
faintest
impression
she
had
come
to
regard
herself
as
part
of
the
routine
a
spoke
of
the
wheel
revolving
with
its
motion
she
felt
almost
like
the
furniture
of
the
room
in
which
she
sat
an
insensate
object
to
be
dusted
and
pushed
about
with
the
chairs
and
tables
and
this
deepening
apathy
held
her
fast
at
lyng
in
spite
of
the
urgent
entreaties
of
friends
and
the
usual
medical
recommendation
of
her
friends
supposed
that
her
refusal
to
move
was
inspired
by
the
belief
that
her
husband
would
one
day
return
to
the
spot
from
which
he
had
vanished
and
a
beautiful
legend
grew
up
about
this
imaginary
state
of
waiting
but
in
reality
she
had
no
such
belief
the
depths
of
anguish
inclosing
her
were
no
longer
lighted
by
flashes
of
hope
she
was
sure
that
boyne
would
never
come
back
that
he
had
gone
out
of
her
sight
as
completely
as
if
death
itself
had
waited
that
day
on
the
threshold
she
had
even
renounced
one
by
one
the
various
theories
as
to
his
disappearance
which
had
been
advanced
by
the
press
the
police
and
her
own
agonized
imagination
in
sheer
lassitude
her
mind
turned
from
these
alternatives
of
horror
and
sank
back
into
the
blank
fact
that
he
was
gone
no
she
would
never
know
what
had
become
of
him
no
one
would
ever
know
but
the
house
the
library
in
which
she
spent
her
long
lonely
evenings
knew
for
it
was
here
that
the
last
scene
had
been
enacted
here
that
the
stranger
had
come
and
spoken
the
word
which
had
caused
boyne
to
rise
and
follow
him
the
floor
she
trod
had
felt
his
tread
the
books
on
the
shelves
had
seen
his
face
and
there
were
moments
when
the
intense
consciousness
of
the
old
dusky
walls
seemed
about
to
break
out
into
some
audible
revelation
of
their
secret
but
the
revelation
never
came
and
she
knew
it
would
never
come
lyng
was
not
one
of
the
garrulous
old
houses
that
betray
the
secrets
intrusted
to
them
its
very
legend
proved
that
it
had
always
been
the
mute
accomplice
the
incorruptible
custodian
of
the
mysteries
it
had
surprised
and
mary
boyne
sitting
face
to
face
with
its
portentous
silence
felt
the
futility
of
seeking
to
break
it
by
any
human
means
v
i
don
t
say
it
straight
yet
don
t
say
it
straight
it
was
mary
at
the
words
lifted
her
head
with
a
start
and
looked
intently
at
the
speaker
when
half
an
hour
before
a
card
with
mr
parvis
on
it
had
been
brought
up
to
her
she
had
been
immediately
aware
that
the
name
had
been
a
part
of
her
consciousness
ever
since
she
had
read
it
at
the
head
of
boyne
s
unfinished
letter
in
the
library
she
had
found
awaiting
her
a
small
man
with
a
bald
head
and
gold
and
it
sent
a
strange
tremor
through
her
to
know
that
this
was
the
person
to
whom
her
husband
s
last
known
thought
had
been
directed
parvis
civilly
but
without
vain
preamble
in
the
manner
of
a
man
who
has
his
watch
in
his
hand
had
set
forth
the
object
of
his
visit
he
had
run
over
to
england
on
business
and
finding
himself
in
the
neighborhood
of
dorchester
had
not
wished
to
leave
it
without
paying
his
respects
to
boyne
without
asking
her
if
the
occasion
offered
what
she
meant
to
do
about
bob
elwell
s
family
the
words
touched
the
spring
of
some
obscure
dread
in
mary
s
bosom
did
her
visitor
after
all
know
what
boyne
had
meant
by
his
unfinished
phrase
she
asked
for
an
elucidation
of
his
question
and
noticed
at
once
that
he
seemed
surprised
at
her
continued
ignorance
of
the
subject
was
it
possible
that
she
really
knew
as
little
as
she
said
i
know
nothing
you
must
tell
me
she
faltered
out
and
her
visitor
thereupon
proceeded
to
unfold
his
story
it
threw
even
to
her
confused
perceptions
and
imperfectly
initiated
vision
a
lurid
glare
on
the
whole
hazy
episode
of
the
blue
star
mine
her
husband
had
made
his
money
in
that
brilliant
speculation
at
the
cost
of
getting
ahead
of
some
one
less
alert
to
seize
the
chance
the
victim
of
his
ingenuity
was
young
robert
elwell
who
had
put
him
on
to
the
blue
star
scheme
parvis
at
mary
s
first
startled
cry
had
thrown
her
a
sobering
glance
through
his
impartial
glasses
bob
elwell
wasn
t
smart
enough
that
s
all
if
he
had
been
he
might
have
turned
round
and
served
boyne
the
same
way
it
s
the
kind
of
thing
that
happens
every
day
in
business
i
guess
it
s
what
the
scientists
call
the
survival
of
the
fittest
said
parvis
evidently
pleased
with
the
aptness
of
his
analogy
mary
felt
a
physical
shrinking
from
the
next
question
she
tried
to
frame
it
was
as
though
the
words
on
her
lips
had
a
taste
that
nauseated
her
but
then
you
accuse
my
husband
of
doing
something
dishonorable
parvis
surveyed
the
question
dispassionately
oh
no
i
don
t
i
don
t
even
say
it
wasn
t
he
glanced
up
and
down
the
long
lines
of
books
as
if
one
of
them
might
have
supplied
him
with
the
definition
he
sought
i
don
t
say
it
straight
and
yet
i
don
t
say
it
straight
it
was
after
all
no
definition
in
his
category
could
be
more
comprehensive
than
that
mary
sat
staring
at
him
with
a
look
of
terror
he
seemed
to
her
like
the
indifferent
implacable
emissary
of
some
dark
formless
power
but
elwell
s
lawyers
apparently
did
not
take
your
view
since
i
suppose
the
suit
was
withdrawn
by
their
oh
yes
they
knew
he
hadn
t
a
leg
to
stand
on
technically
it
was
when
they
advised
him
to
withdraw
the
suit
that
he
got
desperate
you
see
he
d
borrowed
most
of
the
money
he
lost
in
the
blue
star
and
he
was
up
a
tree
that
s
why
he
shot
himself
when
they
told
him
he
had
no
the
horror
was
sweeping
over
mary
in
great
deafening
waves
he
shot
himself
he
killed
himself
because
of
well
he
didn
t
kill
himself
exactly
he
dragged
on
two
months
before
he
parvis
emitted
the
statement
as
unemotionally
as
a
gramophone
grinding
out
its
you
mean
that
he
tried
to
kill
himself
and
failed
and
tried
again
oh
he
didn
t
have
to
try
again
said
parvis
grimly
they
sat
opposite
each
other
in
silence
he
swinging
his
thoughtfully
about
his
finger
she
motionless
her
arms
stretched
along
her
knees
in
an
attitude
of
rigid
tension
but
if
you
knew
all
this
she
began
at
length
hardly
able
to
force
her
voice
above
a
whisper
how
is
it
that
when
i
wrote
you
at
the
time
of
my
husband
s
disappearance
you
said
you
didn
t
understand
his
letter
parvis
received
this
without
perceptible
discomfiture
why
i
didn
t
understand
it
strictly
speaking
and
it
wasn
t
the
time
to
talk
about
it
if
i
had
the
elwell
business
was
settled
when
the
suit
was
withdrawn
nothing
i
could
have
told
you
would
have
helped
you
to
find
your
mary
continued
to
scrutinize
him
then
why
are
you
telling
me
now
still
parvis
did
not
hesitate
well
to
begin
with
i
supposed
you
knew
more
than
you
appear
to
i
mean
about
the
circumstances
of
elwell
s
death
and
then
people
are
talking
of
it
now
the
whole
matter
s
been
raked
up
again
and
i
thought
if
you
didn
t
know
you
ought
she
remained
silent
and
he
continued
you
see
it
s
only
come
out
lately
what
a
bad
state
elwell
s
affairs
were
in
his
wife
s
a
proud
woman
and
she
fought
on
as
long
as
she
could
going
out
to
work
and
taking
sewing
at
home
when
she
got
too
sick
something
with
the
heart
i
believe
but
she
had
his
bedridden
mother
to
look
after
and
the
children
and
she
broke
down
under
it
and
finally
had
to
ask
for
help
that
attracted
attention
to
the
case
and
the
papers
took
it
up
and
a
subscription
was
started
everybody
out
there
liked
bob
elwell
and
most
of
the
prominent
names
in
the
place
are
down
on
the
list
and
people
began
to
wonder
why
parvis
broke
off
to
fumble
in
an
inner
pocket
here
he
continued
here
s
an
account
of
the
whole
thing
from
the
sentinel
a
little
sensational
of
course
but
i
guess
you
d
better
look
it
he
held
out
a
newspaper
to
mary
who
unfolded
it
slowly
remembering
as
she
did
so
the
evening
when
in
that
same
room
the
perusal
of
a
clipping
from
the
sentinel
had
first
shaken
the
depths
of
her
security
as
she
opened
the
paper
her
eyes
shrinking
from
the
glaring
widow
of
boyne
s
victim
forced
to
appeal
for
aid
ran
down
the
column
of
text
to
two
portraits
inserted
in
it
the
first
was
her
husband
s
taken
from
a
photograph
made
the
year
they
had
come
to
england
it
was
the
picture
of
him
that
she
liked
best
the
one
that
stood
on
the
in
her
bedroom
as
the
eyes
in
the
photograph
met
hers
she
felt
it
would
be
impossible
to
read
what
was
said
of
him
and
closed
her
lids
with
the
sharpness
of
the
pain
i
thought
if
you
felt
disposed
to
put
your
name
down
she
heard
parvis
continue
she
opened
her
eyes
with
an
effort
and
they
fell
on
the
other
portrait
it
was
that
of
a
youngish
man
slightly
built
in
rough
clothes
with
features
somewhat
blurred
by
the
shadow
of
a
projecting
where
had
she
seen
that
outline
before
she
stared
at
it
confusedly
her
heart
hammering
in
her
throat
and
ears
then
she
gave
a
cry
this
is
the
man
the
man
who
came
for
my
husband
she
heard
parvis
start
to
his
feet
and
was
dimly
aware
that
she
had
slipped
backward
into
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
that
he
was
bending
above
her
in
alarm
with
an
intense
effort
she
straightened
herself
and
reached
out
for
the
paper
which
she
had
dropped
it
s
the
man
i
should
know
him
anywhere
she
cried
in
a
voice
that
sounded
in
her
own
ears
like
a
scream
parvis
s
voice
seemed
to
come
to
her
from
far
off
down
endless
windings
mrs
boyne
you
re
not
very
well
shall
i
call
somebody
shall
i
get
a
glass
of
water
no
no
no
she
threw
herself
toward
him
her
hand
frantically
clenching
the
newspaper
i
tell
you
it
s
the
man
i
him
he
spoke
to
me
in
the
garden
parvis
took
the
journal
from
her
directing
his
glasses
to
the
portrait
it
can
t
be
boyne
it
s
robert
robert
elwell
her
white
stare
seemed
to
travel
into
space
then
it
was
robert
elwell
who
came
for
came
for
boyne
the
day
he
went
away
parvis
s
voice
dropped
as
hers
rose
he
bent
over
laying
a
fraternal
hand
on
her
as
if
to
coax
her
gently
back
into
her
seat
why
elwell
was
dead
don
t
you
remember
mary
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
picture
unconscious
of
what
he
was
saying
don
t
you
remember
boyne
s
unfinished
letter
to
me
the
one
you
found
on
his
desk
that
day
it
was
written
just
after
he
d
heard
of
elwell
s
she
noticed
an
odd
shake
in
parvis
s
unemotional
voice
surely
you
remember
that
he
urged
her
yes
she
remembered
that
was
the
profoundest
horror
of
it
elwell
had
died
the
day
before
her
husband
s
disappearance
and
this
was
elwell
s
portrait
and
it
was
the
portrait
of
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
her
in
the
garden
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
slowly
about
the
library
the
library
could
have
borne
witness
that
it
was
also
the
portrait
of
the
man
who
had
come
in
that
day
to
call
boyne
from
his
unfinished
letter
through
the
misty
surgings
of
her
brain
she
heard
the
faint
boom
of
words
words
spoken
by
alida
stair
on
the
lawn
at
pangbourne
before
boyne
and
his
wife
had
ever
seen
the
house
at
lyng
or
had
imagined
that
they
might
one
day
live
there
this
was
the
man
who
spoke
to
me
she
repeated
she
looked
again
at
parvis
he
was
trying
to
conceal
his
disturbance
under
what
he
imagined
to
be
an
expression
of
indulgent
commiseration
but
the
edges
of
his
lips
were
blue
he
thinks
me
mad
but
i
m
not
mad
she
reflected
and
suddenly
there
flashed
upon
her
a
way
of
justifying
her
strange
affirmation
she
sat
quiet
controlling
the
quiver
of
her
lips
and
waiting
till
she
could
trust
her
voice
to
keep
its
habitual
level
then
she
said
looking
straight
at
parvis
will
you
answer
me
one
question
please
when
was
it
that
robert
elwell
tried
to
kill
himself
when
when
parvis
stammered
yes
the
date
please
try
to
she
saw
that
he
was
growing
still
more
afraid
of
her
i
have
a
reason
she
insisted
gently
yes
yes
only
i
can
t
remember
about
two
months
before
i
should
i
want
the
date
she
repeated
parvis
picked
up
the
newspaper
we
might
see
here
he
said
still
humoring
her
he
ran
his
eyes
down
the
page
here
it
is
last
october
the
she
caught
the
words
from
him
the
wasn
t
it
with
a
sharp
look
at
her
he
verified
yes
the
then
you
know
i
know
her
white
stare
continued
to
travel
past
him
sunday
the
that
was
the
day
he
came
parvis
s
voice
was
almost
inaudible
came
first
you
saw
him
twice
then
yes
she
breathed
it
at
him
with
dilated
eyes
he
came
first
on
the
of
october
i
remember
the
date
because
it
was
the
day
we
went
up
meldon
steep
for
the
first
she
felt
a
faint
gasp
of
inward
laughter
at
the
thought
that
but
for
that
she
might
have
forgotten
parvis
continued
to
scrutinize
her
as
if
trying
to
intercept
her
gaze
we
saw
him
from
the
roof
she
went
on
he
came
down
the
toward
the
house
he
was
dressed
just
as
he
is
in
that
picture
my
husband
saw
him
first
he
was
frightened
and
ran
down
ahead
of
me
but
there
was
no
one
there
he
had
elwell
had
vanished
parvis
faltered
their
two
whispers
seemed
to
grope
for
each
other
i
couldn
t
think
what
had
happened
i
see
now
he
to
come
then
but
he
wasn
t
dead
enough
he
couldn
t
reach
us
he
had
to
wait
for
two
months
and
then
he
came
back
again
and
ned
went
with
she
nodded
at
parvis
with
the
look
of
triumph
of
a
child
who
has
successfully
worked
out
a
difficult
puzzle
but
suddenly
she
lifted
her
hands
with
a
desperate
gesture
pressing
them
to
her
bursting
temples
oh
my
god
i
sent
him
to
ned
i
told
him
where
to
go
i
sent
him
to
this
room
she
screamed
out
she
felt
the
walls
of
the
room
rush
toward
her
like
inward
falling
ruins
and
she
heard
parvis
a
long
way
off
as
if
through
the
ruins
crying
to
her
and
struggling
to
get
at
her
but
she
was
numb
to
his
touch
she
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
through
the
tumult
she
heard
but
one
clear
note
the
voice
of
alida
stair
speaking
on
the
lawn
at
pangbourne
you
won
t
know
till
afterward
it
said
you
won
t
know
till
long
long
the
letters
i
up
the
long
hill
from
the
station
at
lizzie
west
climbed
in
the
cold
spring
sunshine
as
she
breasted
the
incline
she
noticed
the
first
waves
of
wistaria
over
courtyard
railings
and
the
high
lights
of
new
foliage
against
the
walls
of
gardens
and
she
thought
again
as
she
had
thought
a
hundred
times
before
that
she
had
never
seen
so
beautiful
a
spring
she
was
on
her
way
to
the
deerings
house
in
a
street
near
the
hilltop
and
every
step
was
dear
and
familiar
to
her
she
went
there
five
times
a
week
to
teach
little
juliet
deering
the
daughter
of
vincent
deering
the
distinguished
american
artist
juliet
had
been
her
pupil
for
two
years
and
day
after
day
during
that
time
lizzie
west
had
mounted
the
hill
in
all
weathers
sometimes
with
her
umbrella
bent
against
a
driving
rain
sometimes
with
her
frail
cotton
parasol
unfurled
beneath
a
fiery
sun
sometimes
with
the
snow
soaking
through
her
patched
boots
or
a
bitter
wind
piercing
her
thin
jacket
sometimes
with
the
dust
whirling
about
her
and
bleaching
the
flowers
of
the
poor
little
hat
that
to
carry
her
through
till
next
summer
at
first
the
ascent
had
seemed
tedious
enough
as
dull
as
the
trudge
to
her
other
lessons
lizzie
was
not
a
teacher
she
had
no
born
zeal
for
her
calling
and
though
she
dealt
kindly
and
dutifully
with
her
pupils
she
did
not
fly
to
them
on
winged
feet
but
one
day
something
had
happened
to
change
the
face
of
life
and
since
then
the
climb
to
the
deering
house
had
seemed
like
a
up
a
heavenly
stairway
her
heart
beat
faster
as
she
remembered
it
no
longer
in
a
tumult
of
fright
and
but
softly
peacefully
as
if
brooding
over
a
possession
that
none
could
take
from
her
it
was
on
a
day
of
the
previous
october
that
she
had
stopped
after
juliet
s
lesson
to
ask
if
she
might
speak
to
juliet
s
papa
one
had
always
to
apply
to
deering
if
there
was
anything
to
be
said
about
the
lessons
deering
lay
on
her
lounge
reading
greasy
relays
of
novels
the
choice
of
which
she
left
to
the
cook
and
the
nurse
who
were
always
fetching
them
for
her
from
the
de
lecture
and
it
was
understood
in
the
house
that
she
was
not
to
be
bothered
about
juliet
deering
s
interest
in
his
daughter
was
fitful
rather
than
consecutive
but
at
least
he
was
approachable
and
listened
sympathetically
if
a
little
absently
stroking
his
long
fair
mustache
while
lizzie
stated
her
difficulty
or
put
in
her
plea
for
maps
or
yes
yes
of
course
whatever
you
think
right
he
would
always
assent
sometimes
drawing
a
piece
from
his
pocket
and
laying
it
carelessly
on
the
table
or
oftener
saying
with
his
charming
smile
get
what
you
please
and
just
put
it
on
your
account
you
but
this
time
lizzie
had
not
come
to
ask
for
maps
or
or
even
to
hint
in
crimson
misery
as
once
poor
soul
she
had
had
to
do
that
deering
had
overlooked
her
last
little
account
had
probably
not
noticed
that
she
had
left
it
some
two
months
earlier
on
a
corner
of
his
littered
that
hour
had
been
bad
enough
though
he
had
done
his
best
to
make
it
easy
to
carry
it
off
gallantly
and
gaily
but
this
was
infinitely
worse
for
she
had
come
to
complain
of
her
pupil
to
say
that
much
as
she
loved
little
juliet
it
was
useless
unless
deering
could
do
something
to
go
on
with
the
lessons
it
wouldn
t
be
honest
i
should
be
robbing
you
i
m
not
sure
that
i
haven
t
already
she
half
laughed
through
mounting
tears
as
she
put
her
case
little
juliet
would
not
work
would
not
obey
her
poor
little
drifting
existence
floated
aimlessly
between
the
kitchen
and
the
and
all
the
groping
tendrils
of
her
curiosity
were
fastened
about
the
doings
of
the
backstairs
it
was
the
same
kind
of
curiosity
that
deering
overhead
in
her
room
lavished
on
her
novels
and
on
the
society
notes
of
the
morning
paper
but
since
juliet
s
horizon
was
not
yet
wide
enough
to
embrace
these
loftier
objects
her
interest
was
centered
in
the
anecdotes
that
celeste
and
suzanne
brought
back
from
the
market
and
the
library
that
these
were
not
always
of
an
edifying
nature
the
child
s
artless
prattle
too
often
betrayed
but
unhappily
they
occupied
her
fancy
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
such
nourishing
items
as
dates
and
dynasties
and
the
sources
of
the
principal
european
rivers
at
length
the
crisis
became
so
acute
that
poor
lizzie
felt
herself
bound
to
resign
her
charge
or
ask
deering
s
intervention
and
for
juliet
s
sake
she
chose
the
harder
alternative
it
hard
to
speak
to
him
not
only
because
one
hated
still
more
to
ascribe
it
to
such
vulgar
causes
but
because
one
blushed
to
bring
them
to
the
notice
of
a
spirit
engaged
with
higher
things
deering
was
very
busy
at
that
moment
he
had
a
new
picture
and
lizzie
entered
the
studio
with
the
flutter
of
one
profanely
intruding
on
some
sacred
rite
she
almost
heard
the
rustle
of
retreating
wings
as
she
approached
and
then
and
then
how
differently
it
had
all
turned
out
perhaps
it
wouldn
t
have
if
she
hadn
t
been
such
a
goose
she
who
so
seldom
cried
so
prided
herself
on
a
stoic
control
of
her
little
twittering
cageful
of
but
if
she
had
cried
it
was
because
he
had
looked
at
her
so
kindly
so
softly
and
because
she
had
nevertheless
felt
him
so
pained
and
shamed
by
what
she
said
the
pain
of
course
lay
for
both
in
the
implication
behind
her
words
in
the
one
word
they
left
unspoken
if
little
juliet
was
as
she
was
it
was
because
of
the
mother
the
mother
who
had
given
her
child
her
futile
impulses
and
grudged
her
the
care
that
might
have
guided
them
the
wretched
case
so
obviously
revolved
in
its
own
vicious
circle
that
when
deering
had
murmured
of
course
if
my
wife
were
not
an
invalid
they
both
turned
with
a
simultaneous
spring
to
the
flagrant
bad
example
of
celeste
and
suzanne
fastening
on
that
with
a
mutual
insistence
that
ended
in
his
crying
out
all
the
more
then
how
can
you
leave
her
to
them
but
if
i
do
her
no
good
lizzie
wailed
and
it
was
then
that
when
he
took
her
hand
and
assured
her
gently
but
you
do
you
do
it
was
then
that
in
the
traditional
phrase
she
broke
down
and
her
conventional
protest
quivered
off
into
tears
you
do
good
at
any
rate
you
make
the
house
seem
less
like
a
desert
she
heard
him
say
and
the
next
moment
she
felt
herself
drawn
to
him
and
they
kissed
each
other
through
her
weeping
they
kissed
each
other
there
was
the
new
fact
one
does
not
if
one
is
a
poor
little
teacher
living
in
mme
clopin
s
pension
suisse
at
passy
and
if
one
has
pretty
brown
hair
and
eyes
that
reach
out
trustfully
to
other
eyes
one
does
not
under
these
common
but
defenseless
conditions
arrive
at
the
age
of
without
being
now
and
then
kissed
waylaid
once
by
a
noisy
student
between
two
doors
surprised
once
by
one
s
professor
as
one
bent
over
the
theme
he
was
correcting
but
these
episodes
if
they
tarnish
the
surface
do
not
reach
the
heart
it
is
not
the
kiss
endured
but
the
kiss
returned
that
lives
and
lizzie
west
s
first
kiss
was
for
vincent
deering
as
she
drew
back
from
it
something
new
awoke
in
her
something
deeper
than
the
fright
and
the
shame
and
the
penitent
thought
of
deering
a
sleeping
germ
of
life
thrilled
and
unfolded
and
started
out
blindly
to
seek
the
sun
she
might
have
felt
differently
perhaps
the
shame
and
penitence
might
have
prevailed
had
she
not
known
him
so
kind
and
tender
and
guessed
him
so
baffled
poor
and
disappointed
she
knew
the
failure
of
his
married
life
and
she
divined
a
corresponding
failure
in
his
artistic
career
lizzie
who
had
made
her
own
faltering
snatch
at
the
same
laurels
brought
her
thwarted
proficiency
to
bear
on
the
question
of
his
pictures
which
she
judged
to
be
extremely
brilliant
but
suspected
of
having
somehow
failed
to
affirm
their
merit
publicly
she
understood
that
he
had
tasted
an
earlier
moment
of
success
a
mention
a
medal
something
official
and
tangible
then
the
tide
of
publicity
had
somehow
set
the
other
way
and
left
him
stranded
in
a
noble
isolation
it
was
extraordinary
and
unbelievable
that
any
one
so
naturally
eminent
and
exceptional
should
have
been
subject
to
the
same
vulgar
necessities
that
governed
her
own
life
should
have
known
poverty
and
obscurity
and
indifference
but
she
gathered
that
this
had
been
the
case
and
felt
that
it
formed
the
miraculous
link
between
them
for
through
what
medium
less
revealing
than
that
of
shared
misfortune
would
he
ever
have
perceived
so
inconspicuous
an
object
as
herself
and
she
recalled
now
how
gently
his
eyes
had
rested
on
her
from
the
first
the
gray
eyes
that
might
have
seemed
mocking
if
they
had
not
been
so
gentle
she
remembered
how
he
had
met
her
the
first
day
when
deering
s
inevitable
headache
had
prevented
her
from
receiving
the
new
teacher
and
how
his
few
questions
had
at
once
revealed
his
interest
in
the
little
stranded
compatriot
doomed
to
earn
a
precarious
living
so
far
from
her
native
shore
sweet
as
the
moment
of
unburdening
had
been
she
wondered
afterward
what
had
determined
it
how
she
so
shy
and
sequestered
had
found
herself
letting
slip
her
whole
story
even
to
the
avowal
of
the
ineffectual
artistic
tendencies
that
had
drawn
her
to
paris
and
had
then
left
her
there
to
the
dry
task
of
tuition
she
wondered
at
first
but
she
understood
now
she
understood
everything
after
he
had
kissed
her
it
was
simply
because
he
was
as
kind
as
he
was
great
she
thought
of
this
now
as
she
mounted
the
hill
in
the
spring
sunshine
and
she
thought
of
all
that
had
happened
since
the
intervening
months
as
she
looked
back
at
them
were
merged
in
a
vast
golden
haze
through
which
here
and
there
rose
the
outline
of
a
shining
island
the
haze
was
the
general
enveloping
sense
of
his
love
and
the
shining
islands
were
the
days
they
had
spent
together
they
had
never
kissed
again
under
his
own
roof
lizzie
s
professional
honor
had
a
keen
edge
but
she
had
been
spared
the
vulgar
necessity
of
making
him
feel
it
it
was
of
the
essence
of
her
fatality
that
he
always
understood
when
his
failing
to
do
so
might
have
imperiled
his
hold
on
her
but
her
thursdays
and
sundays
were
free
and
it
soon
became
a
habit
to
give
them
to
him
she
knew
for
her
peace
of
mind
only
too
much
about
pictures
and
galleries
and
churches
had
been
the
one
bright
outlet
from
the
grayness
of
her
personal
atmosphere
for
poetry
too
and
the
other
imaginative
forms
of
literature
she
had
always
felt
more
than
she
had
hitherto
had
occasion
to
betray
and
now
all
these
folded
sympathies
shot
out
their
tendrils
to
the
light
deering
knew
how
to
express
with
unmatched
clearness
and
competence
the
thoughts
that
trembled
in
her
mind
to
talk
with
him
was
to
soar
up
into
the
azure
on
the
outspread
wings
of
his
intelligence
and
look
down
dizzily
yet
distinctly
on
all
the
wonders
and
glories
of
the
world
she
was
a
little
ashamed
sometimes
to
find
how
few
definite
impressions
she
brought
back
from
these
flights
but
that
was
doubtless
because
her
heart
beat
so
fast
when
he
was
near
and
his
smile
made
his
words
like
a
long
quiver
of
light
afterward
in
quieter
hours
fragments
of
their
talk
emerged
in
her
memory
with
wondrous
precision
every
syllable
as
minutely
chiseled
as
some
of
the
delicate
objects
in
crystal
or
ivory
that
he
pointed
out
in
the
museums
they
frequented
it
was
always
a
puzzle
to
lizzie
that
some
of
their
hours
should
be
so
blurred
and
others
so
vivid
on
the
morning
in
question
she
was
reliving
all
these
memories
with
unusual
distinctness
for
it
was
a
fortnight
since
she
had
seen
her
friend
deering
some
six
weeks
previously
had
gone
to
visit
a
relation
at
and
after
she
had
been
a
month
absent
her
husband
and
the
little
girl
had
joined
her
lizzie
s
adieux
to
deering
had
been
made
on
a
rainy
afternoon
in
the
damp
corridors
of
the
aquarium
at
the
trocadero
she
could
not
receive
him
at
her
own
that
a
teacher
should
be
visited
by
the
father
of
a
pupil
especially
when
that
father
was
still
as
madame
clopin
said
was
against
that
lady
s
austere
helvetian
code
from
deering
s
first
tentative
hint
of
another
solution
lizzie
had
recoiled
in
a
wild
unreasoned
flurry
of
all
her
scruples
he
took
her
no
no
as
he
took
all
her
twists
and
turns
of
conscience
with
eyes
and
and
an
instant
acquiescence
which
was
the
finest
homage
to
the
lady
she
felt
he
divined
and
honored
in
her
so
they
continued
to
meet
in
museums
and
galleries
or
to
extend
on
fine
days
their
explorations
to
the
suburbs
where
now
and
then
in
the
solitude
of
grove
or
garden
the
kiss
renewed
itself
fleeting
isolated
or
prolonged
in
a
shy
silent
pressure
of
the
hand
but
on
the
day
of
his
the
rain
kept
them
under
cover
and
as
they
threaded
the
subterranean
windings
of
the
aquarium
and
lizzie
looked
unseeingly
at
the
monstrous
faces
glaring
at
her
through
walls
of
glass
she
felt
like
a
poor
drowned
wretch
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
with
all
her
glancing
sunlit
memories
rolling
over
her
like
the
waves
of
its
surface
you
ll
never
see
him
again
never
see
him
again
the
waves
boomed
in
her
ears
through
his
last
words
and
when
she
had
said
to
him
at
the
corner
and
had
scrambled
wet
and
shivering
into
the
passy
omnibus
its
great
grinding
wheels
took
up
the
derisive
burden
never
see
him
never
see
him
all
that
was
only
two
weeks
ago
and
here
she
was
as
happy
as
a
lark
mounting
the
hill
to
his
door
in
the
spring
sunshine
so
weak
a
heart
did
not
deserve
such
a
radiant
fate
and
lizzie
said
to
herself
that
she
would
never
again
distrust
her
star
ii
the
cracked
bell
tinkled
sweetly
through
her
heart
as
she
stood
listening
for
the
scamper
of
juliet
s
feet
juliet
anticipating
the
laggard
suzanne
almost
always
opened
the
door
for
her
governess
not
from
any
unnatural
zeal
to
hasten
the
hour
of
her
studies
but
from
the
irrepressible
desire
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
street
but
on
this
occasion
lizzie
listened
vainly
for
a
step
and
at
length
gave
the
bell
another
twitch
doubtless
some
unusually
absorbing
incident
had
detained
the
child
thus
only
could
her
absence
be
explained
a
third
ring
produced
no
response
and
lizzie
full
of
dawning
fears
drew
back
to
look
up
at
the
shabby
blistered
house
she
saw
that
the
studio
shutters
stood
wide
and
then
noticed
without
surprise
that
deering
s
were
still
unopened
no
doubt
deering
was
resting
after
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
instinctively
lizzie
s
eyes
turned
again
to
the
studio
and
as
she
looked
she
saw
deering
at
the
window
he
caught
sight
of
her
and
an
instant
later
came
to
the
door
he
looked
paler
than
usual
and
she
noticed
that
he
wore
a
black
coat
i
rang
and
rang
where
is
juliet
he
looked
at
her
gravely
almost
solemnly
then
without
answering
he
led
her
down
the
passage
to
the
studio
and
closed
the
door
when
she
had
entered
my
wife
is
dead
she
died
suddenly
ten
days
ago
didn
t
you
see
it
in
the
papers
lizzie
with
a
little
cry
sank
down
on
the
rickety
divan
she
seldom
saw
a
newspaper
since
she
could
not
afford
one
for
her
own
perusal
and
those
supplied
to
the
pension
clopin
were
usually
in
the
hands
of
its
more
privileged
lodgers
till
long
after
the
hour
when
she
set
out
on
her
morning
round
no
i
didn
t
see
it
she
stammered
deering
was
silent
he
stood
a
little
way
off
twisting
an
unlit
cigarette
in
his
hand
and
looking
down
at
her
with
a
gaze
that
was
both
hesitating
and
constrained
she
too
felt
the
constraint
of
the
situation
the
impossibility
of
finding
words
that
after
what
had
passed
between
them
should
seem
neither
false
nor
heartless
and
at
last
she
exclaimed
standing
up
poor
little
juliet
can
t
i
go
to
her
juliet
is
not
here
i
left
her
at
with
the
relations
with
whom
my
wife
was
oh
lizzie
murmured
feeling
vaguely
that
this
added
to
the
difficulty
of
the
moment
how
differently
she
had
pictured
their
meeting
i
m
so
so
sorry
for
her
she
faltered
out
deering
made
no
reply
but
turning
on
his
heel
walked
the
length
of
the
studio
and
then
halted
vaguely
before
the
picture
on
the
easel
it
was
the
landscape
he
had
begun
the
previous
autumn
with
the
intention
of
sending
it
to
the
salon
that
spring
but
it
was
still
unfinished
seemed
indeed
hardly
more
advanced
than
on
the
fateful
october
day
when
lizzie
standing
before
it
for
the
first
time
had
confessed
her
inability
to
deal
with
juliet
perhaps
the
same
thought
struck
its
creator
for
he
broke
into
a
dry
laugh
and
turned
from
the
easel
with
a
shrug
under
his
protracted
silence
lizzie
roused
herself
to
the
fact
that
since
her
pupil
was
absent
there
was
no
reason
for
her
remaining
any
longer
and
as
deering
again
moved
toward
her
she
said
with
an
effort
i
ll
go
then
you
ll
send
for
me
when
she
comes
back
deering
still
hesitated
tormenting
the
cigarette
between
his
fingers
she
s
not
coming
back
not
at
lizzie
heard
him
with
a
drop
of
the
heart
was
everything
to
be
changed
in
their
lives
but
of
course
how
could
she
have
dreamed
it
would
be
otherwise
she
could
only
stupidly
repeat
not
coming
back
not
this
spring
probably
not
since
are
friends
are
so
good
as
to
keep
her
the
fact
is
i
ve
got
to
go
to
america
my
wife
left
a
little
property
a
few
pennies
that
i
must
go
and
see
to
for
the
lizzie
stood
before
him
a
cold
knife
in
her
breast
i
see
i
see
she
reiterated
feeling
all
the
while
that
she
strained
her
eyes
into
impenetrable
blackness
it
s
a
nuisance
having
to
pull
up
stakes
he
went
on
with
a
fretful
glance
about
the
studio
she
lifted
her
eyes
slowly
to
his
face
shall
you
be
gone
long
she
took
courage
to
ask
there
again
i
can
t
tell
it
s
all
so
frightfully
mixed
he
met
her
look
for
an
incredibly
long
strange
moment
i
hate
to
go
he
murmured
as
if
to
himself
lizzie
felt
a
rush
of
moisture
to
her
lashes
and
the
old
familiar
wave
of
weakness
at
her
heart
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
face
with
an
instinctive
gesture
and
as
she
did
so
he
held
out
his
arms
come
here
lizzie
he
said
and
she
went
went
with
a
sweet
wild
throb
of
liberation
with
the
sense
that
at
last
the
house
was
his
that
was
his
if
he
wanted
her
that
never
again
would
that
silent
rebuking
presence
in
the
room
above
constrain
and
shame
her
rapture
he
pushed
back
her
veil
and
covered
her
face
with
kisses
don
t
cry
you
little
goose
he
said
iii
that
they
must
see
each
other
again
before
his
departure
in
someplace
less
exposed
than
their
usual
haunts
was
as
clear
to
lizzie
as
it
appeared
to
be
to
deering
his
expressing
the
wish
seemed
indeed
the
sweetest
testimony
to
the
quality
of
his
feeling
since
in
the
first
weeks
of
the
most
perfunctory
widowerhood
a
man
of
his
stamp
is
presumed
to
abstain
from
light
adventures
if
then
at
such
a
moment
he
wished
so
much
to
be
quietly
and
gravely
with
her
it
could
be
only
for
reasons
she
did
not
call
by
name
but
of
which
she
felt
the
sacred
tremor
in
her
heart
and
it
would
have
seemed
incredibly
vain
and
vulgar
to
put
forward
at
such
a
crisis
the
conventional
objections
by
means
of
which
such
existences
defend
the
treasure
of
their
freshness
in
such
a
mood
as
this
one
may
descend
from
the
passy
omnibus
at
the
corner
of
the
pont
de
la
concorde
she
had
not
let
him
fetch
her
in
a
cab
with
a
sense
of
dedication
almost
solemn
and
may
advance
to
meet
one
s
fate
in
the
shape
of
a
gentleman
of
melancholy
elegance
with
an
at
his
call
as
one
has
advanced
to
the
in
some
girlish
bridal
vision
even
the
experienced
waiter
ushering
them
into
an
upper
room
of
the
quiet
restaurant
on
the
seine
could
hardly
have
supposed
their
quest
for
seclusion
to
be
based
on
sentimental
motives
so
soberly
did
deering
give
his
orders
while
his
companion
sat
small
and
grave
at
his
side
she
did
not
indeed
mean
to
let
her
private
pang
obscure
their
hour
together
she
was
already
learning
that
deering
shrank
from
sadness
he
should
see
that
she
had
courage
and
gaiety
to
face
their
coming
separation
and
yet
give
herself
meanwhile
to
this
completer
nearness
but
she
waited
as
always
for
him
to
strike
the
opening
note
looking
back
at
it
later
she
wondered
at
the
mild
suavity
of
the
hour
her
heart
was
unversed
in
happiness
but
he
had
found
the
tone
to
lull
her
apprehensions
and
make
her
trust
her
fate
for
any
golden
wonder
deepest
of
all
he
gave
her
the
sense
of
something
tacit
and
confirmed
between
them
as
if
his
tenderness
were
a
habit
of
the
heart
hardly
needing
the
support
of
outward
proof
such
proof
as
he
offered
came
therefore
as
a
kind
of
crowning
luxury
the
flower
of
a
profoundly
rooted
sentiment
and
here
again
the
instinctive
reserves
and
defenses
would
have
seemed
to
vulgarize
what
his
trust
ennobled
but
if
all
the
tender
casuistries
of
her
heart
were
at
his
service
he
took
no
grave
advantage
of
them
even
when
they
sat
alone
after
dinner
with
the
lights
of
the
river
trembling
through
their
one
low
window
and
the
vast
rumor
of
paris
inclosing
them
in
a
heart
of
silence
he
seemed
as
much
as
herself
under
the
spell
of
hallowing
influences
she
felt
it
most
of
all
as
she
yielded
to
the
arm
he
presently
put
about
her
to
the
long
caress
he
laid
on
her
lips
and
eyes
not
a
word
or
gesture
missed
the
note
of
quiet
union
or
cast
a
doubt
in
retrospect
on
the
pact
they
sealed
with
their
last
look
that
pact
as
she
reviewed
it
through
a
sleepless
night
seemed
to
have
consisted
mainly
on
his
part
in
pleadings
for
full
and
frequent
news
of
her
on
hers
in
the
assurance
that
it
should
be
given
as
often
as
he
asked
it
she
had
felt
an
intense
desire
not
to
betray
any
undue
eagerness
any
crude
desire
to
affirm
and
define
her
hold
on
him
her
life
had
given
her
a
certain
acquaintance
with
the
arts
of
defense
girls
in
her
situation
were
commonly
supposed
to
know
them
all
and
to
use
them
as
occasion
called
but
lizzie
s
very
need
of
them
had
intensified
her
disdain
just
because
she
was
so
poor
and
had
always
materially
so
to
count
her
change
and
calculate
her
margin
she
would
at
least
know
the
joy
of
emotional
prodigality
would
give
her
heart
as
recklessly
as
the
rich
their
millions
she
was
sure
now
that
deering
loved
her
and
if
he
had
seized
the
occasion
of
their
farewell
to
give
her
some
definitely
worded
sign
of
his
feeling
if
more
plainly
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
his
doing
so
would
have
seemed
less
like
a
proof
of
his
sincerity
than
of
his
suspecting
in
her
the
need
of
a
verbal
warrant
that
he
had
abstained
seemed
to
show
that
he
trusted
her
as
she
trusted
him
and
that
they
were
one
most
of
all
in
this
deep
security
of
understanding
she
had
tried
to
make
him
divine
all
this
in
the
chariness
of
her
promise
to
write
she
would
write
of
course
she
would
but
he
would
be
busy
preoccupied
on
the
move
it
was
for
him
to
let
her
know
when
he
wished
a
word
to
spare
her
the
embarrassment
of
intrusions
intrusions
he
had
smiled
the
word
away
you
can
t
well
intrude
my
darling
on
a
heart
where
you
re
already
established
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
other
and
then
taking
her
hands
and
looking
up
from
them
into
her
happy
dizzy
eyes
you
don
t
know
much
about
being
in
love
do
you
lizzie
he
laughingly
ended
it
seemed
easy
enough
to
reject
this
imputation
in
a
kiss
but
she
wondered
afterward
if
she
had
not
deserved
it
was
she
really
cold
and
conventional
and
did
other
women
give
more
richly
and
recklessly
she
found
that
it
was
possible
to
turn
about
every
one
of
her
reserves
and
delicacies
so
that
they
looked
like
selfish
scruples
and
petty
pruderies
and
at
this
game
she
came
in
time
to
exhaust
all
the
resources
of
an
casuistry
meanwhile
the
first
days
after
deering
s
departure
wore
a
soft
refracted
light
like
the
radiance
lingering
after
sunset
at
any
rate
was
taxable
with
no
reserves
no
calculations
and
his
letters
of
farewell
from
train
and
steamer
filled
her
with
long
murmurs
and
echoes
of
his
presence
how
he
loved
her
how
he
loved
her
and
how
he
knew
how
to
tell
her
so
she
was
not
sure
of
possessing
the
same
aptitude
unused
to
the
expression
of
personal
emotion
she
fluctuated
between
the
impulse
to
pour
out
all
she
felt
and
the
fear
lest
her
extravagance
should
amuse
or
even
bore
him
she
never
lost
the
sense
that
what
was
to
her
the
central
crisis
of
experience
must
be
a
mere
episode
in
a
life
so
predestined
as
his
to
romantic
accidents
all
that
she
felt
and
said
would
be
subjected
to
the
test
of
comparison
with
what
others
had
already
given
him
from
all
quarters
of
the
globe
she
saw
passionate
missives
winging
their
way
toward
deering
for
whom
her
poor
little
of
devotion
could
certainly
not
make
a
summer
but
such
moments
were
succeeded
by
others
in
which
she
raised
her
head
and
dared
inwardly
to
affirm
her
conviction
that
no
woman
had
ever
loved
him
just
as
she
had
and
that
none
therefore
had
probably
found
just
such
things
to
say
to
him
and
this
conviction
strengthened
the
other
less
solidly
based
belief
that
also
for
the
same
reason
had
found
new
accents
to
express
his
tenderness
and
that
the
three
letters
she
wore
all
day
in
her
shabby
blouse
and
hid
all
night
beneath
her
pillow
surpassed
not
only
in
beauty
but
in
quality
all
he
had
ever
penned
for
other
eyes
they
gave
her
at
any
rate
during
the
weeks
that
she
wore
them
on
her
heart
sensations
even
more
complex
and
delicate
than
deering
s
actual
presence
had
ever
occasioned
to
be
with
him
was
always
like
breasting
a
bright
rough
sea
that
blinded
while
it
buoyed
her
but
his
letters
formed
a
still
pool
of
contemplation
above
which
she
could
bend
and
see
the
reflection
of
the
sky
and
the
myriad
movements
of
life
that
flitted
and
gleamed
below
the
surface
the
wealth
of
his
hidden
life
that
was
what
most
surprised
her
it
was
incredible
to
her
now
that
she
had
had
no
inkling
of
it
but
had
kept
on
blindly
along
the
narrow
track
of
habit
like
a
traveler
climbing
a
road
in
a
fog
who
suddenly
finds
himself
on
a
sunlit
crag
between
blue
leagues
of
sky
and
dizzy
depths
of
valley
and
the
odd
thing
was
that
all
the
people
about
her
the
whole
world
of
the
passy
pension
were
still
plodding
along
the
same
dull
path
preoccupied
with
the
pebbles
underfoot
and
unconscious
of
the
glory
beyond
the
fog
there
were
wild
hours
when
she
longed
to
cry
out
to
them
what
one
saw
from
the
summit
and
hours
of
tremulous
abasement
when
she
asked
herself
why
happy
feet
had
been
guided
there
while
others
no
doubt
as
worthy
stumbled
and
blundered
in
obscurity
she
felt
in
particular
a
sudden
urgent
pity
for
the
two
or
three
other
girls
at
mme
clopin
s
girls
older
duller
less
alive
than
she
and
by
that
very
token
more
appealingly
flung
upon
her
sympathy
would
they
ever
know
had
they
ever
known
those
were
the
questions
that
haunted
her
as
she
crossed
her
companions
on
the
stairs
faced
them
at
the
and
listened
to
their
poor
pining
talk
in
the
one
of
the
girls
was
swiss
the
other
english
the
third
andora
macy
was
a
young
lady
from
the
southern
states
who
was
studying
french
with
the
ultimate
object
of
imparting
it
to
the
inmates
of
a
girls
school
at
macon
georgia
andora
macy
was
pale
faded
immature
she
had
a
drooping
southern
accent
and
a
manner
which
fluctuated
between
arch
audacity
and
fits
of
panicky
hauteur
she
yearned
to
be
admired
and
feared
to
be
insulted
and
yet
seemed
tragically
conscious
that
she
was
destined
to
miss
both
these
extremes
of
sensation
or
to
enjoy
them
only
at
second
hand
in
the
experiences
of
her
more
privileged
friends
it
was
perhaps
for
this
reason
that
she
took
a
wistful
interest
in
lizzie
who
had
shrunk
from
her
at
first
as
the
depressing
image
of
her
own
probable
future
but
to
whom
she
had
now
suddenly
become
an
object
of
sentimental
pity
iv
miss
macy
s
room
was
next
to
miss
west
s
and
the
southerner
s
knock
often
appealed
to
lizzie
s
hospitality
when
mme
clopin
s
early
curfew
had
driven
her
boarders
from
the
it
sounded
thus
one
evening
just
as
lizzie
tired
from
an
unusually
long
day
of
tuition
was
in
the
act
of
removing
her
dress
she
was
in
too
indulgent
a
mood
to
withhold
her
come
in
and
as
miss
macy
crossed
the
threshold
lizzie
felt
that
vincent
deering
s
first
letter
the
letter
from
the
train
had
slipped
from
her
loosened
bodice
to
the
floor
miss
macy
as
promptly
noting
the
fact
darted
forward
to
recover
the
letter
lizzie
stooped
also
fiercely
jealous
of
her
touch
but
the
other
reached
the
precious
paper
first
and
as
she
seized
it
lizzie
knew
that
she
had
seen
whence
it
fell
and
was
weaving
round
the
incident
a
rapid
web
of
romance
lizzie
blushed
with
annoyance
it
s
too
stupid
having
no
pockets
if
one
gets
a
letter
as
she
is
going
out
in
the
morning
she
has
to
carry
it
in
her
blouse
all
miss
macy
looked
at
her
with
swimming
eyes
it
s
warm
from
your
heart
she
breathed
reluctantly
yielding
up
the
missive
lizzie
laughed
for
she
knew
better
she
knew
it
was
the
letter
that
had
warmed
her
heart
poor
andora
macy
would
never
know
her
bleak
bosom
would
never
take
fire
from
such
a
contact
lizzie
looked
at
her
with
kind
eyes
secretly
chafing
at
the
injustice
of
fate
the
next
evening
on
her
return
home
she
found
andora
hovering
in
the
entrance
hall
i
thought
you
d
like
me
to
put
this
in
your
own
hand
miss
macy
whispered
significantly
pressing
a
letter
upon
lizzie
i
couldn
t
to
see
it
lying
on
the
table
with
the
it
was
deering
s
letter
from
the
steamer
lizzie
blushed
to
the
forehead
but
without
resenting
andora
s
divination
she
could
not
have
breathed
a
word
of
her
bliss
but
she
was
not
altogether
sorry
to
have
it
guessed
and
pity
for
andora
s
destitution
yielded
to
the
pleasure
of
using
it
as
a
mirror
for
her
own
abundance
deering
wrote
again
on
reaching
new
york
a
long
fond
dissatisfied
letter
vague
in
its
indication
of
his
own
projects
specific
in
the
expression
of
his
love
lizzie
brooded
over
every
syllable
of
it
till
they
formed
the
undercurrent
of
all
her
waking
thoughts
and
murmured
through
her
midnight
dreams
but
she
would
have
been
happier
if
they
had
shed
some
definite
light
on
the
future
that
would
come
no
doubt
when
he
had
had
time
to
look
about
and
get
his
bearings
she
counted
up
the
days
that
must
elapse
before
she
received
his
next
letter
and
stole
down
early
to
peep
at
the
papers
and
learn
when
the
next
american
mail
was
due
at
length
the
happy
date
arrived
and
she
hurried
distractedly
through
the
day
s
work
trying
to
conceal
her
impatience
by
the
endearments
she
bestowed
upon
her
pupils
it
was
easier
in
her
present
mood
to
kiss
them
than
to
keep
them
at
their
grammars
that
evening
on
mme
clopin
s
threshold
her
heart
beat
so
wildly
that
she
had
to
lean
a
moment
against
the
before
entering
but
on
the
hall
table
where
the
letters
lay
there
was
none
for
her
she
went
over
them
with
a
feverish
hand
her
heart
dropping
down
and
down
as
she
had
sometimes
fallen
down
an
endless
stairway
in
a
dream
the
very
same
stairway
up
which
she
had
seemed
to
fly
when
she
climbed
the
long
hill
to
deering
s
door
then
it
suddenly
struck
her
that
andora
might
have
found
and
secreted
her
letter
and
with
a
spring
she
was
on
the
actual
stairs
and
rattling
miss
macy
s
you
ve
a
letter
for
me
haven
t
you
she
panted
miss
macy
turning
from
the
inclosed
her
in
attenuated
arms
oh
darling
did
you
expect
one
do
give
it
to
me
lizzie
pleaded
with
burning
eyes
but
i
haven
t
any
there
hasn
t
been
a
sign
of
a
letter
for
i
know
there
is
there
be
lizzie
persisted
stamping
her
foot
but
dearest
i
ve
for
you
and
there
s
been
nothing
absolutely
day
after
day
for
the
ensuing
weeks
the
same
scene
reenacted
itself
with
endless
variations
lizzie
after
the
first
sharp
spasm
of
disappointment
made
no
effort
to
conceal
her
anxiety
from
miss
macy
and
the
fond
andora
was
charged
to
keep
a
vigilant
eye
upon
the
postman
s
coming
and
to
spy
on
the
for
possible
negligence
or
perfidy
but
these
elaborate
precautions
remained
fruitless
and
no
letter
from
deering
came
during
the
first
fortnight
of
silence
lizzie
exhausted
all
the
ingenuities
of
explanation
she
marveled
afterward
at
the
reasons
she
had
found
for
deering
s
silence
there
were
moments
when
she
almost
argued
herself
into
thinking
it
more
natural
than
his
continuing
to
write
there
was
only
one
reason
which
her
intelligence
consistently
rejected
and
that
was
the
possibility
that
he
had
forgotten
her
that
the
whole
episode
had
faded
from
his
mind
like
a
breath
from
a
mirror
from
that
she
resolutely
turned
her
thoughts
aware
that
if
she
suffered
herself
to
contemplate
it
the
motive
power
of
life
would
fail
and
she
would
no
longer
understand
why
she
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
laydown
at
night
if
she
had
had
leisure
to
indulge
her
anguish
she
might
have
been
unable
to
keep
such
speculations
at
bay
but
she
had
to
be
up
and
working
the
had
to
be
paid
and
mme
clopin
s
weekly
bill
and
all
the
little
extras
that
even
her
frugal
habits
had
to
reckon
with
and
in
the
depths
of
her
thought
dwelt
the
dogging
fear
of
illness
and
incapacity
goading
her
to
work
while
she
could
she
hardly
remembered
the
time
when
she
had
been
without
that
fear
it
was
second
nature
now
and
it
kept
her
on
her
feet
when
other
incentives
might
have
failed
in
the
blankness
of
her
misery
she
felt
no
dread
of
death
but
the
horror
of
being
ill
and
dependent
was
in
her
blood
in
the
first
weeks
of
silence
she
wrote
again
and
again
to
deering
entreating
him
for
a
word
for
a
mere
sign
of
life
from
the
first
she
had
shrunk
from
seeming
to
assert
any
claim
on
his
future
yet
in
her
aching
bewilderment
she
now
charged
herself
with
having
been
too
possessive
too
exacting
in
her
tone
she
told
herself
that
his
fastidiousness
shrank
from
any
but
a
light
touch
and
that
hers
had
not
been
light
enough
she
should
have
kept
to
the
character
of
the
little
friend
the
artless
consciousness
in
which
tormented
genius
may
find
an
escape
from
its
complexities
and
instead
she
had
dramatized
their
relation
exaggerated
her
own
part
in
it
presumed
forsooth
to
share
the
front
of
the
stage
with
him
instead
of
being
content
to
serve
as
scenery
or
chorus
but
though
to
herself
she
admitted
and
even
insisted
on
the
episodical
nature
of
the
experience
on
the
fact
that
for
deering
it
could
be
no
more
than
an
incident
she
was
still
convinced
that
his
sentiment
for
her
however
fugitive
had
been
genuine
his
had
not
been
the
attitude
of
the
unscrupulous
male
seeking
a
vulgar
for
a
moment
he
had
really
needed
her
and
if
he
was
silent
now
it
was
perhaps
because
he
feared
that
she
had
mistaken
the
nature
of
the
need
and
built
vain
hopes
on
its
possible
duration
it
was
of
the
very
essence
of
lizzie
s
devotion
that
it
sought
instinctively
the
larger
freedom
of
its
object
she
could
not
conceive
of
love
under
any
form
of
exaction
or
compulsion
to
make
this
clear
to
deering
became
an
overwhelming
need
and
in
a
last
short
letter
she
explicitly
freed
him
from
whatever
sentimental
obligation
its
predecessors
might
have
seemed
to
impose
in
this
studied
communication
she
playfully
accused
herself
of
having
unwittingly
sentimentalized
their
relation
affirming
in
a
retrospective
astuteness
a
sense
of
the
impermanence
of
the
tenderer
sentiments
that
almost
put
deering
in
the
fatuous
position
of
having
mistaken
coquetry
for
surrender
and
she
ended
gracefully
with
a
plea
for
the
continuance
of
the
friendly
regard
which
she
had
always
understood
to
be
the
basis
of
their
sympathy
the
document
when
completed
seemed
to
her
worthy
of
what
she
conceived
to
be
deering
s
conception
of
a
woman
of
the
world
and
she
found
a
spectral
satisfaction
in
the
thought
of
making
her
final
appearance
before
him
in
that
distinguished
character
but
she
was
never
destined
to
learn
what
effect
the
appearance
produced
for
the
letter
like
those
it
sought
to
excuse
remained
unanswered
v
the
fresh
spring
sunshine
which
had
so
often
attended
lizzie
weston
her
dusty
climb
up
the
hill
of
beamed
on
her
some
two
years
later
in
a
scene
and
a
situation
of
altered
import
the
of
the
filtered
its
rays
through
the
symmetrical
umbrage
inclosing
the
graveled
space
about
daurent
s
restaurant
and
miss
west
seated
at
a
table
within
that
privileged
circle
presented
to
the
light
a
hat
much
better
able
to
sustain
its
scrutiny
than
those
which
had
sheltered
the
brow
of
juliet
deering
s
instructress
her
dress
was
in
keeping
with
the
hat
and
both
belonged
to
a
situation
rich
in
such
possibilities
as
the
act
of
a
leisurely
luncheon
at
daurent
s
in
the
opening
week
of
the
salon
her
companions
of
both
sexes
confirmed
and
emphasized
this
impression
by
an
elaborateness
of
garb
and
an
ease
of
attitude
implying
the
largest
range
of
selection
between
the
forms
of
parisian
idleness
and
even
andora
macy
seated
opposite
as
in
the
place
of
or
companion
reflected
in
coy
grays
and
mauves
the
festal
note
of
the
occasion
this
note
reverberated
persistently
in
the
ears
of
a
solitary
gentleman
straining
for
glimpses
of
the
group
from
a
table
wedged
in
the
remotest
corner
of
the
garden
but
to
miss
west
herself
the
occurrence
did
not
rise
above
the
usual
for
nearly
a
year
she
had
been
acquiring
the
habit
of
such
situations
and
the
act
of
offering
a
luncheon
at
daurent
s
to
her
cousins
the
harvey
mearses
of
providence
and
their
friend
jackson
benn
produced
in
her
no
emotion
beyond
the
languid
glow
which
benn
s
presence
was
beginning
to
impart
to
such
scenes
it
s
frightful
the
way
you
ve
got
used
to
it
andora
macy
had
wailed
in
the
first
days
of
her
friend
s
transfigured
fortune
when
lizzie
west
had
waked
one
morning
to
find
herself
among
the
heirs
of
an
old
and
miserly
cousin
whose
testamentary
dispositions
had
formed
since
her
earliest
childhood
the
subject
of
pleasantry
and
conjecture
in
her
own
improvident
family
old
hezron
mears
had
never
given
any
sign
of
life
to
the
luckless
wests
had
perhaps
hardly
been
conscious
of
including
them
in
the
carefully
drawn
will
which
following
the
old
american
convention
scrupulously
divided
his
hoarded
millions
among
his
kin
it
was
by
a
mere
genealogical
accident
that
lizzie
falling
just
within
the
golden
circle
found
herself
possessed
of
a
pittance
sufficient
to
release
her
from
the
prospect
of
a
long
gray
future
in
mme
clopin
s
pension
the
release
had
seemed
wonderful
at
first
yet
she
presently
found
that
it
had
destroyed
her
former
world
without
giving
her
anew
one
on
the
ruins
of
the
old
pension
life
bloomed
the
only
flower
that
had
ever
sweetened
her
path
and
beyond
the
sense
of
present
ease
and
the
removal
of
anxiety
for
the
future
her
reconstructed
existence
blossomed
with
no
compensating
joys
she
had
hoped
great
things
from
the
opportunity
to
rest
to
travel
to
look
about
her
above
all
in
various
artful
feminine
ways
to
be
nice
to
the
companions
of
her
less
privileged
state
but
such
widenings
of
scope
left
her
as
it
were
but
the
more
conscious
of
the
empty
margin
of
personal
life
beyond
them
it
was
not
till
she
woke
to
the
leisure
of
her
new
days
that
she
had
the
full
sense
of
what
was
gone
from
them
their
very
emptiness
made
her
strain
to
pack
them
with
transient
sensations
she
was
like
the
possessor
of
an
unfurnished
house
with
random
furniture
and
perpetually
pouring
in
on
it
was
in
this
experimental
character
that
jackson
benn
had
fixed
her
attention
and
the
languid
effort
of
her
imagination
to
adjust
him
to
her
requirements
was
seconded
by
the
fond
complicity
of
andora
and
the
smiling
approval
of
her
cousins
lizzie
did
not
discourage
these
demonstrations
she
suffered
serenely
andora
s
allusions
to
benn
s
infatuation
and
mears
s
casual
boast
of
his
business
standing
all
the
better
if
they
could
drape
his
narrow
frame
and
round
unwinking
countenance
in
the
trailing
mists
of
sentiment
lizzie
looked
and
listened
not
unhopeful
of
the
miracle
i
never
saw
anything
like
the
way
these
frenchmen
stare
doesn
t
it
make
you
nervous
lizzie
mears
broke
out
suddenly
ruffling
her
feather
boa
about
an
outraged
bosom
mears
was
still
in
that
stage
of
development
when
her
countrywomen
taste
to
the
full
the
peril
of
being
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
the
licentious
gaul
lizzie
roused
herself
from
the
contemplation
of
benn
s
round
baby
cheeks
and
the
square
blue
jaw
resting
on
his
perpendicular
collar
is
some
one
staring
at
me
she
asked
with
a
smile
don
t
turn
round
whatever
you
do
there
just
over
there
between
the
rhododendrons
the
tall
fair
man
alone
at
that
table
really
harvey
i
think
you
ought
to
speak
to
the
or
something
though
i
suppose
in
one
of
these
places
they
d
only
laugh
at
you
mears
shudderingly
concluded
her
husband
as
if
inclining
to
this
probability
continued
the
undisturbed
dissection
of
his
chicken
wing
but
benn
perhaps
aware
that
his
situation
demanded
a
more
punctilious
attitude
sternly
revolved
upon
the
parapet
of
his
high
collar
in
the
direction
of
mears
s
glance
what
that
fellow
all
alone
over
there
why
not
french
he
s
an
american
he
then
proclaimed
with
a
perceptible
relaxing
of
the
facial
muscles
oh
murmured
mears
as
perceptibly
disappointed
and
benn
continued
carelessly
he
came
over
on
the
steamer
with
me
he
s
some
kind
of
an
artist
a
fellow
named
deering
he
was
staring
at
i
guess
wondering
whether
i
was
going
to
remember
him
why
how
d
e
do
how
are
you
why
yes
of
course
with
pleasure
my
friends
harvey
mears
mears
my
friends
miss
macy
and
miss
i
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
miss
west
said
vincent
deering
with
a
smile
vi
even
through
his
smile
lizzie
had
seen
in
the
first
moment
how
changed
he
was
and
the
impression
of
the
change
deepened
to
the
point
of
pain
when
a
few
days
later
in
reply
to
his
brief
note
she
accorded
him
a
private
hour
that
the
first
sight
of
his
writing
the
first
answer
to
his
letters
should
have
come
after
three
long
years
in
the
shape
of
this
impersonal
line
too
curt
to
be
called
humble
yet
confessing
to
a
consciousness
of
the
past
by
the
studied
avoidance
of
its
language
as
she
read
her
mind
flashed
back
over
what
she
had
dreamed
his
letters
would
be
over
the
exquisite
answers
she
had
composed
above
his
name
there
was
nothing
exquisite
in
the
conventional
lines
before
her
but
dormant
nerves
began
to
throb
again
at
the
mere
touch
of
the
paper
he
had
touched
and
she
threw
the
little
note
into
the
fire
before
she
dared
to
reply
to
it
now
that
he
was
actually
before
her
again
he
became
as
usual
the
one
live
spot
in
her
consciousness
once
more
her
tormented
throbbing
self
sank
back
passive
and
numb
but
now
with
all
its
power
of
suffering
mysteriously
transferred
to
the
presence
so
known
yet
so
unknown
at
the
opposite
corner
of
her
hearth
she
was
still
lizzie
west
and
he
was
still
vincent
deering
but
the
styx
rolled
between
them
and
she
saw
his
face
through
its
fog
it
was
his
face
really
rather
than
his
words
that
told
her
as
she
furtively
studied
it
the
tale
of
failure
and
slow
discouragement
which
had
so
blurred
its
handsome
lines
she
kept
afterward
no
precise
memory
of
the
actual
details
of
his
narrative
the
pain
it
evidently
cost
him
to
impart
it
was
so
much
the
sharpest
fact
in
her
new
vision
of
him
confusedly
however
she
gathered
that
on
reaching
america
he
had
found
his
wife
s
small
property
gravely
impaired
and
that
while
lingering
on
to
secure
what
remained
of
it
he
had
contrived
to
sell
a
picture
or
two
and
had
even
known
a
brief
moment
of
success
during
which
he
received
orders
and
set
up
a
studio
but
inexplicably
the
tide
had
ebbed
his
work
remained
on
his
hands
and
a
tedious
illness
with
its
miserable
sequel
of
debt
soon
wiped
out
his
small
advantage
there
followed
a
period
of
eclipse
still
more
vaguely
pictured
during
which
she
was
allowed
to
infer
that
he
had
tried
his
hand
at
divers
means
of
livelihood
accepting
employment
from
a
fashionable
designing
illustrating
magazine
articles
and
acting
for
a
time
she
dimly
understood
as
the
social
tout
of
a
new
hotel
desirous
of
advertising
its
restaurant
these
disjointed
facts
were
strung
on
a
slender
thread
of
personal
allusions
references
to
friends
who
had
been
kind
jealously
she
guessed
them
to
be
women
and
to
enemies
who
had
darkly
schemed
against
him
but
true
to
his
tradition
of
correctness
he
carefully
avoided
the
mention
of
names
and
left
her
trembling
conjectures
to
grope
dimly
through
an
alien
crowded
world
in
which
there
seemed
little
room
for
her
small
shy
presence
as
she
listened
her
private
pang
was
merged
in
the
intolerable
sense
of
his
unhappiness
nothing
he
had
said
explained
or
excused
his
conduct
to
her
but
he
had
suffered
he
had
been
lonely
had
been
humiliated
and
she
suddenly
felt
with
a
fierce
maternal
rage
that
there
was
no
conceivable
justification
for
any
scheme
of
things
in
which
such
facts
were
possible
she
could
not
have
said
why
she
simply
knew
that
it
hurt
too
much
to
see
him
hurt
gradually
it
came
to
her
that
her
unconsciousness
of
any
personal
grievance
was
due
to
her
having
so
definitely
determined
her
own
future
she
was
glad
she
had
decided
as
she
now
felt
she
had
to
marry
jackson
benn
if
only
for
the
sense
of
detachment
it
gave
her
in
dealing
with
the
case
of
vincent
deering
her
personal
safety
insured
her
the
requisite
impartiality
and
justified
her
in
dwelling
as
long
as
she
chose
on
the
last
lines
of
a
chapter
to
which
her
own
act
had
deliberately
fixed
the
close
any
lingering
hesitations
as
to
the
finality
of
her
decision
were
dispelled
by
the
imminent
need
of
making
it
known
to
deering
and
when
her
visitor
paused
in
his
reminiscences
to
say
with
a
sigh
but
many
things
have
happened
to
you
too
his
words
did
not
so
much
evoke
the
sense
of
her
altered
fortunes
as
the
image
of
the
protector
to
whom
she
was
about
to
intrust
them
yes
many
things
it
s
three
years
she
answered
deering
sat
leaning
forward
in
his
sad
exiled
elegance
his
eyes
gently
bent
on
hers
and
at
his
side
she
saw
the
solid
form
of
jackson
benn
with
shoulders
preternaturally
squared
by
the
cut
of
his
tight
black
coat
and
a
tall
shiny
collar
sustaining
his
baby
cheeks
and
hard
blue
chin
then
the
vision
faded
as
deering
began
to
speak
three
years
he
repeated
musingly
taking
up
her
words
i
ve
so
often
wondered
what
they
d
brought
she
lifted
her
head
with
a
quick
blush
and
the
terrified
wish
that
he
should
not
at
the
cost
of
all
his
notions
of
correctness
lapse
into
the
blunder
of
becoming
you
ve
wondered
she
smiled
back
bravely
do
you
suppose
i
haven
t
his
look
dwelt
on
her
yes
i
daresay
that
what
you
thought
of
she
had
her
answer
pat
why
frankly
you
know
i
think
of
but
the
mounting
tide
of
her
poor
dishonored
memories
swept
it
indignantly
away
if
it
was
his
correctness
to
ignore
it
could
never
be
hers
to
disavow
that
what
you
thought
of
me
she
heard
him
repeat
in
a
tone
of
sad
insistence
and
at
that
with
a
quick
lift
of
her
head
she
resolutely
answered
how
could
i
know
what
to
think
i
had
no
word
from
if
she
had
expected
and
perhaps
almost
hoped
that
this
answer
would
create
a
difficulty
for
him
the
gaze
of
quiet
fortitude
with
which
he
met
it
proved
that
she
had
underestimated
his
resources
no
you
had
no
word
i
kept
my
vow
he
said
your
vow
that
you
have
a
word
not
a
syllable
oh
i
kept
it
through
everything
lizzie
s
heart
was
sounding
in
her
ears
the
old
confused
rumor
of
the
sea
of
life
but
through
it
she
desperately
tried
to
distinguish
the
still
small
voice
of
reason
what
your
vow
why
shouldn
t
i
have
had
a
syllable
from
you
he
sat
motionless
still
holding
her
with
a
look
so
gentle
that
it
almost
seemed
forgiving
then
abruptly
he
rose
and
crossing
the
space
between
them
sat
down
in
a
chair
at
her
side
the
deliberation
of
his
movement
might
have
implied
a
forgetfulness
of
changed
conditions
and
lizzie
as
if
thus
viewing
it
drew
slightly
back
but
he
appeared
not
to
notice
her
recoil
and
his
eyes
at
last
leaving
her
face
slowly
and
approvingly
made
the
round
of
the
small
bright
this
is
charming
yes
things
changed
for
you
he
said
a
moment
before
she
had
prayed
that
he
might
be
spared
the
error
of
a
vain
return
upon
the
past
it
was
as
if
all
her
retrospective
tenderness
dreading
to
see
him
at
such
a
disadvantage
rose
up
to
protect
him
from
it
but
his
evasiveness
exasperated
her
and
suddenly
she
felt
the
inconsistent
desire
to
hold
him
fast
face
to
face
with
his
own
words
before
she
could
reiterate
her
question
however
he
had
met
her
with
another
you
think
of
me
then
why
are
you
afraid
to
tell
me
that
you
did
the
unexpectedness
of
the
challenge
wrung
an
indignant
cry
from
her
didn
t
my
letters
tell
you
so
enough
ah
your
letters
keeping
her
gaze
on
his
in
a
passion
of
unrelenting
fixity
she
could
detect
in
him
no
confusion
not
the
least
quiver
of
a
sensitive
nerve
he
only
gazed
back
at
her
more
sadly
they
went
everywhere
with
me
your
letters
he
said
yet
you
never
answered
at
last
the
accusation
trembled
to
her
lips
yet
i
never
answered
did
you
ever
so
much
as
read
them
i
wonder
all
the
demons
of
were
up
in
her
now
and
she
loosed
them
on
him
as
if
to
escape
from
their
rage
deering
hardly
seemed
to
hear
her
question
he
merely
shifted
his
attitude
leaning
a
little
nearer
to
her
but
without
attempting
by
the
least
gesture
to
remind
her
of
the
privileges
which
such
nearness
had
once
implied
there
were
beautiful
wonderful
things
in
them
he
said
smiling
she
felt
herself
stiffen
under
his
smile
you
ve
waited
three
years
to
tell
me
so
he
looked
at
her
with
grave
surprise
and
do
you
resent
my
telling
you
even
now
his
parries
were
incredible
they
left
her
with
a
breathless
sense
of
thrusting
at
emptiness
and
a
desperate
almost
vindictive
desire
to
drive
him
against
the
wall
and
pin
him
there
no
only
i
wonder
you
should
take
the
trouble
to
tell
me
when
at
the
time
and
now
with
a
sudden
turn
he
gave
her
the
final
surprise
of
meeting
her
squarely
on
her
own
ground
when
at
the
time
i
didn
t
but
how
i
at
the
time
why
couldn
t
you
you
ve
not
yet
told
me
he
gave
her
again
his
look
of
disarming
patience
do
i
need
to
hasn
t
my
whole
wretched
story
told
you
told
me
why
you
never
answered
my
letters
yes
since
i
could
only
answer
them
in
one
way
by
protesting
my
love
and
my
there
was
a
long
pause
of
resigned
expectancy
on
his
part
on
hers
of
a
wild
confused
reconstruction
of
her
shattered
past
you
mean
then
that
you
didn
t
write
because
because
i
found
when
i
reached
america
that
i
was
a
pauper
that
my
wife
s
money
was
gone
and
that
what
i
could
earn
i
ve
so
little
gift
that
way
was
barely
enough
to
keep
juliet
clothed
and
educated
it
was
as
if
an
iron
door
had
been
suddenly
locked
and
barred
between
lizzie
felt
herself
driven
back
panting
upon
the
last
defenses
of
her
incredulity
you
might
at
least
have
told
me
have
explained
do
you
think
i
shouldn
t
have
understood
he
did
not
hesitate
you
would
have
understood
it
wasn
t
what
was
it
then
she
quavered
it
s
wonderful
you
shouldn
t
see
simply
that
i
couldn
t
write
you
anything
else
not
and
so
you
preferred
to
let
me
suffer
there
was
a
shade
of
reproach
in
his
eyes
i
suffered
too
he
said
it
was
his
first
direct
appeal
to
her
compassion
and
for
a
moment
it
nearly
unsettled
the
delicate
poise
of
her
sympathies
and
sent
them
trembling
in
the
direction
of
scorn
and
irony
but
even
as
the
impulse
rose
it
was
stayed
by
another
sensation
once
again
as
so
often
in
the
past
she
became
aware
of
a
fact
which
in
his
absence
she
always
failed
to
reckon
with
the
fact
of
the
deep
irreducible
difference
between
his
image
in
her
mind
and
his
actual
self
the
mysterious
alteration
in
her
judgment
produced
by
the
inflections
of
his
voice
the
look
of
his
eyes
the
whole
complex
pressure
of
his
personality
she
had
phrased
it
once
by
saying
to
herself
that
she
never
could
remember
him
so
completely
did
the
sight
of
him
supersede
the
counterfeit
about
which
her
fancy
wove
its
perpetual
wonders
bright
and
breathing
as
that
counterfeit
was
it
became
a
gray
figment
of
the
mind
at
the
touch
of
his
presence
and
on
this
occasion
the
immediate
result
was
to
cause
her
to
feel
his
possible
unhappiness
with
an
intensity
beside
which
her
private
injury
paled
i
suffered
horribly
he
repeated
and
all
the
more
that
i
couldn
t
make
a
sign
couldn
t
cry
out
my
misery
there
was
only
one
escape
from
it
all
to
hold
my
tongue
and
pray
that
you
might
hate
the
blood
rushed
to
lizzie
s
forehead
hate
you
you
prayed
that
i
might
hate
you
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
moving
closer
lifted
her
hand
gently
in
his
yes
because
your
letters
showed
me
that
if
you
didn
t
you
d
be
unhappier
her
hand
lay
motionless
with
the
warmth
of
his
flowing
through
it
and
her
thoughts
too
her
poor
fluttering
stormy
thoughts
felt
themselves
suddenly
penetrated
by
the
same
soft
current
of
communion
and
i
meant
to
keep
my
resolve
he
went
on
slowly
releasing
his
clasp
i
meant
to
keep
it
even
after
the
random
stream
of
things
swept
me
back
here
in
your
way
but
when
i
saw
you
the
other
day
i
felt
that
what
had
been
possible
at
a
distance
was
impossible
now
that
we
were
near
each
other
how
was
it
possible
to
see
you
and
want
you
to
hate
me
he
had
moved
away
but
not
to
resume
his
seat
he
merely
paused
at
a
little
distance
his
hand
resting
on
a
in
the
transient
attitude
that
precedes
departure
lizzie
s
heart
contracted
he
was
going
then
and
this
was
his
farewell
he
was
going
and
she
could
find
no
word
to
detain
him
but
the
senseless
stammer
i
never
hated
he
considered
her
with
his
faint
grave
smile
it
s
not
necessary
at
any
rate
that
you
should
do
so
now
time
and
circumstances
have
made
me
so
harmless
that
s
exactly
why
i
ve
dared
to
venture
back
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
how
i
rejoice
in
your
good
fortune
it
s
the
only
obstacle
between
us
that
i
can
t
bring
myself
to
wish
lizzie
sat
silent
spellbound
as
she
listened
by
the
sudden
evocation
of
jackson
benn
he
stood
there
again
between
herself
and
deering
perpendicular
and
reproachful
but
less
solid
and
sharply
outlined
than
before
with
a
look
in
his
small
hard
eyes
that
desperately
wailed
for
reembodiment
deering
was
continuing
his
farewell
speech
you
re
rich
now
you
re
free
you
will
she
vaguely
saw
him
holding
out
his
hand
it
s
not
true
that
i
m
engaged
she
broke
out
they
were
the
last
words
she
had
meant
to
utter
they
were
hardly
related
to
her
conscious
thoughts
but
she
felt
her
whole
will
suddenly
gathered
up
in
the
irrepressible
impulse
to
repudiate
and
fling
away
from
her
forever
the
spectral
claim
of
jackson
benn
vii
it
was
the
firm
conviction
of
andora
macy
that
every
object
in
the
vincent
deerings
charming
little
house
at
neuilly
had
been
expressly
designed
for
the
deerings
son
to
play
with
the
house
was
full
of
pretty
things
some
not
obviously
applicable
to
the
purpose
but
miss
macy
s
casuistry
was
equal
tothe
baby
s
appetite
and
the
baby
s
mother
was
no
match
for
them
in
the
art
of
defending
her
possessions
there
were
moments
in
fact
when
lizzie
almost
fell
in
with
andora
s
summary
division
of
her
works
of
art
into
articles
safe
or
unsafe
for
the
baby
to
lick
or
resisted
it
only
to
the
extent
of
occasionally
substituting
some
less
precious
or
less
perishable
object
for
the
particular
fragility
on
which
her
son
s
desire
was
fixed
and
it
was
with
this
intention
that
on
a
certain
fair
spring
morning
which
wore
the
added
luster
of
being
the
baby
s
second
birthday
she
had
murmured
with
her
mouth
in
his
curls
and
one
hand
holding
a
bit
of
chelsea
above
his
dangerous
clutch
wouldn
t
he
rather
have
that
beautiful
shiny
thing
over
there
in
aunt
andorra
s
hand
the
two
friends
were
together
in
lizzie
s
little
the
room
she
had
chosen
on
acquiring
the
house
because
when
she
sat
there
she
could
hear
deering
s
step
as
he
paced
up
and
down
before
his
easel
in
the
studio
she
had
built
for
him
his
step
had
been
less
regularly
audible
than
she
had
hoped
for
after
three
years
of
wedded
bliss
he
had
somehow
failed
to
settle
down
to
the
great
work
which
was
to
result
from
that
privileged
state
but
even
when
she
did
not
hear
him
she
knew
that
he
was
there
above
her
head
stretched
out
on
the
old
divan
from
passy
and
smoking
endless
cigarettes
while
he
skimmed
the
morning
papers
and
the
sense
of
his
nearness
had
not
yet
lost
its
first
keen
edge
of
bliss
lizzie
herself
on
the
day
in
question
was
engaged
in
a
more
arduous
task
than
the
study
of
the
morning
s
news
she
had
never
unlearned
the
habit
of
orderly
activity
and
the
trait
she
least
understood
in
her
husband
s
character
was
his
way
of
letting
the
loose
ends
of
life
hang
as
they
would
she
had
been
disposed
at
first
to
ascribe
this
to
the
chronic
incoherence
of
his
first
but
now
she
knew
that
though
he
basked
under
the
rule
of
her
beneficent
hand
he
would
never
feel
any
active
impulse
to
further
its
work
he
liked
to
see
things
fall
into
place
about
him
at
a
wave
of
her
wand
but
his
enjoyment
of
her
household
magic
in
no
way
diminished
his
smiling
irresponsibility
and
it
was
with
one
of
its
least
amiable
consequences
that
his
wife
and
her
friend
were
now
dealing
before
them
stood
two
trunks
and
a
distended
portmanteau
which
had
shed
their
contents
in
heterogeneous
heaps
over
lizzie
s
rosy
carpet
they
represented
the
hostages
left
by
her
husband
on
his
somewhat
precipitate
departure
from
a
new
york
and
indignantly
redeemed
by
her
on
her
learning
in
a
curt
letter
from
his
landlady
that
the
latter
was
not
disposed
to
regard
them
as
an
equivalent
for
the
arrears
of
deering
s
board
lizzie
had
not
been
shocked
by
the
discovery
that
her
husband
had
left
america
in
debt
she
had
too
sad
an
acquaintance
with
the
economic
strain
to
see
any
humiliation
in
such
accidents
but
it
offended
her
sense
of
order
that
he
should
not
have
liquidated
his
obligation
in
the
three
years
since
their
marriage
he
took
her
remonstrance
with
his
usual
disarming
grace
and
left
her
to
forward
the
liberating
draft
though
her
delicacy
had
provided
him
with
a
which
assured
his
personal
independence
lizzie
had
discharged
the
duty
without
repugnance
since
she
knew
that
his
delegating
it
to
her
was
the
result
of
his
indolence
and
not
of
any
design
on
her
exchequer
deering
was
not
dazzled
by
money
his
altered
fortunes
had
tempted
him
to
no
excesses
he
was
simply
too
lazy
to
draw
the
check
as
he
had
been
too
lazy
to
remember
the
debt
it
canceled
no
dear
no
lizzie
lifted
the
chelsea
figure
higher
can
t
you
find
something
for
him
andora
among
that
rubbish
over
there
where
s
the
beaded
bag
you
had
in
your
hand
just
now
i
don
t
think
it
could
hurt
him
to
lick
miss
macy
bag
in
hand
rose
from
her
knees
and
stumbled
through
the
slough
of
frayed
garments
and
old
studio
properties
before
the
group
of
mother
and
son
she
fell
into
a
raptured
attitude
do
look
at
him
reach
for
it
the
tyrant
isn
t
he
just
like
the
young
napoleon
lizzie
laughed
and
swung
her
son
in
air
dangle
it
before
him
andora
if
you
let
him
have
it
too
quickly
he
won
t
care
for
it
he
s
just
like
any
man
i
andora
slowly
lowered
the
shining
bag
till
the
heir
of
the
deerings
closed
his
masterful
fist
upon
it
there
my
chelsea
s
safe
lizzie
smiled
setting
her
boy
on
the
floor
and
watching
him
stagger
away
with
his
booty
andora
stood
beside
her
watching
too
have
you
any
idea
where
that
bag
came
from
lizzie
deering
bent
above
a
pile
of
shirts
shook
an
inattentive
head
i
never
saw
such
wicked
washing
there
isn
t
one
that
s
fit
to
mend
the
bag
no
i
ve
not
the
least
andora
surveyed
her
dramatically
doesn
t
it
make
you
utterly
miserable
to
think
that
some
woman
may
have
made
it
for
him
lizzie
bowed
in
anxious
scrutiny
above
the
shirts
broke
into
an
unruffled
laugh
really
andora
really
six
seven
nine
no
there
isn
t
even
a
dozen
there
isn
t
a
whole
dozen
of
i
don
t
see
how
men
live
alone
andora
broodingly
pursued
her
theme
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
it
doesn
t
make
you
jealous
to
handle
these
things
of
his
that
other
women
may
have
given
him
lizzie
shook
her
head
again
and
straightening
herself
with
a
smile
tossed
a
bundle
in
her
friend
s
direction
no
it
doesn
t
make
me
the
least
bit
jealous
here
count
these
socks
for
me
like
a
andora
moaned
don
t
you
feel
at
all
as
the
socks
landed
in
her
hollow
bosom
but
lizzie
intent
upon
her
task
tranquilly
continued
to
unfold
and
sort
she
felt
a
great
deal
as
she
did
so
but
her
feelings
were
too
deep
and
delicate
for
the
simplifying
process
of
speech
she
only
knew
that
each
article
she
drew
from
the
trunks
sent
through
her
the
long
tremor
of
deering
s
touch
it
was
part
of
her
wonderful
new
life
that
everything
belonging
to
him
contained
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
himself
a
fraction
becoming
visible
in
the
warmth
of
her
love
as
certain
secret
elements
become
visible
in
rare
intensities
of
temperature
and
in
the
case
of
the
objects
before
her
poor
shabby
witnesses
of
his
days
of
failure
what
they
gave
out
acquired
a
special
poignancy
from
its
contrast
to
his
present
cherished
state
his
shirts
were
all
in
round
dozens
now
and
washed
as
carefully
as
old
lace
as
for
his
socks
she
knew
the
pattern
of
every
pair
and
would
have
liked
to
see
the
washerwoman
who
dared
to
mislay
one
or
bring
it
home
with
the
colors
run
and
in
these
homely
tokens
of
his
she
saw
the
symbol
of
what
her
tenderness
had
brought
him
he
was
safe
in
it
encompassed
by
it
morally
and
materially
and
she
defied
the
embattled
powers
of
malice
to
reach
him
through
the
armor
of
her
love
such
feelings
however
were
not
communicable
even
had
one
desired
to
express
them
they
were
no
more
to
be
distinguished
from
the
sense
of
life
itself
than
bees
from
the
in
which
they
murmur
oh
do
at
him
lizzie
he
s
found
out
how
to
open
the
bag
lizzie
lifted
her
head
to
smile
a
moment
at
her
son
who
sat
throned
on
a
heap
of
studio
rubbish
with
andora
before
him
on
adoring
knees
she
thought
vaguely
poor
andora
and
then
resumed
the
discouraged
inspection
of
a
buttonless
white
waistcoat
the
next
sound
she
was
aware
of
was
a
fluttered
exclamation
from
her
friend
why
lizzie
do
you
know
what
he
used
the
bag
for
to
keep
your
letters
in
lizzie
looked
up
more
quickly
she
was
aware
that
andora
s
pronoun
had
changed
its
object
and
was
now
applied
to
deering
and
it
struck
her
as
odd
and
slightly
disagreeable
that
a
letter
of
hers
should
be
found
among
the
rubbish
abandoned
in
her
husband
s
new
york
lodgings
how
funny
give
it
to
me
give
the
bag
to
aunt
andora
darling
here
look
inside
and
see
what
else
a
big
big
boy
can
find
there
yes
here
s
another
why
why
lizzie
rose
with
a
shade
of
impatience
and
crossed
the
floor
to
the
romping
group
beside
the
other
trunk
what
is
it
give
me
the
letters
as
she
spoke
she
suddenly
recalled
the
day
when
in
mme
clopin
s
she
had
addressed
a
similar
behest
to
andora
macy
andora
had
lifted
a
look
of
startled
conjecture
why
this
one
s
never
been
opened
do
you
suppose
that
awful
woman
could
have
kept
it
from
him
lizzie
laughed
andora
s
imaginings
were
really
puerile
what
awful
woman
his
landlady
don
t
be
such
a
goose
andora
how
can
it
have
been
kept
back
from
him
when
we
ve
found
it
here
among
his
things
yes
but
then
why
was
it
never
opened
andora
held
out
the
letter
and
lizzie
took
it
the
writing
was
hers
the
envelop
bore
the
passy
postmark
and
it
was
unopened
she
stood
looking
at
it
with
a
sudden
sharp
drop
of
the
heart
why
so
are
the
others
all
unopened
andora
threw
out
on
a
rising
note
but
lizzie
stooping
over
stretched
out
her
hand
give
them
to
me
oh
lizzie
lizzie
andora
still
on
her
knees
continued
to
hold
back
the
packet
her
pale
face
paler
with
anger
and
compassion
lizzie
they
re
the
letters
i
used
to
post
for
you
letters
he
never
answered
look
give
them
back
to
me
the
two
women
faced
each
other
andora
kneeling
lizzie
motionless
before
her
the
letters
in
her
hand
the
blood
had
rushed
to
her
face
humming
in
her
ears
and
forcing
itself
into
the
veins
of
her
temples
like
hot
lead
then
it
ebbed
and
she
felt
cold
and
weak
it
must
have
been
some
plot
some
conspiracy
andora
cried
so
fired
by
the
ecstasy
of
invention
that
for
the
moment
she
seemed
lost
to
all
but
the
esthetic
aspect
of
the
case
lizzie
turned
away
her
eyes
with
an
effort
and
they
rested
on
the
boy
who
sat
at
her
feet
placidly
sucking
the
tassels
of
the
bag
his
mother
stooped
and
extracted
them
from
his
rosy
mouth
which
a
cry
of
wrath
immediately
filled
she
lifted
him
in
her
arms
and
for
the
first
time
no
current
of
life
ran
from
his
body
into
hers
he
felt
heavy
and
clumsy
like
some
one
else
s
child
and
his
screams
annoyed
her
take
him
away
please
oh
lizzie
lizzie
andora
wailed
lizzie
held
out
the
child
and
andora
struggling
to
her
feet
received
him
i
know
just
how
you
feel
she
gasped
out
above
the
baby
s
head
lizzie
in
some
dark
hollow
of
herself
heard
the
echo
of
a
laugh
andora
always
thought
she
knew
how
people
felt
tell
marthe
to
take
him
with
her
when
she
fetches
juliet
home
from
yes
andora
gloated
over
her
if
you
d
only
give
way
my
darling
the
baby
howling
dived
over
andora
s
shoulder
for
the
bag
oh
him
his
mother
ordered
andora
from
the
door
cried
out
i
ll
be
back
at
once
remember
love
you
re
not
alone
but
lizzie
insisted
go
with
them
i
wish
you
to
go
with
them
in
the
tone
to
which
miss
macy
had
never
learned
the
answer
the
door
closed
on
her
outraged
back
and
lizzie
stood
alone
she
looked
about
the
disordered
room
which
offered
a
dreary
image
of
the
havoc
of
her
life
an
hour
or
two
ago
everything
about
her
had
been
so
exquisitely
ordered
without
and
within
her
thoughts
and
emotions
had
lain
outspread
before
her
like
delicate
jewels
laid
away
symmetrically
in
a
collector
s
cabinet
now
they
had
been
tossed
down
among
the
rubbish
there
on
the
floor
and
had
themselves
turned
to
rubbish
like
the
rest
yes
there
lay
her
life
at
her
feet
among
all
that
tarnished
trash
she
knelt
and
picked
up
her
letters
ten
in
all
and
examined
the
flaps
of
the
envelops
not
one
had
been
opened
not
one
as
she
looked
every
word
she
had
written
fluttered
to
life
and
every
feeling
prompting
it
sent
a
tremor
through
her
with
vertiginous
speed
and
microscopic
vision
she
was
reliving
that
whole
period
of
her
life
stripping
bare
again
the
black
ruin
over
which
the
drift
of
three
happy
years
had
fallen
she
laughed
at
andora
s
notion
of
a
conspiracy
of
the
letters
having
been
kept
she
required
no
extraneous
aid
in
deciphering
the
mystery
her
three
years
experience
of
deering
shed
on
it
all
the
light
she
needed
and
yet
a
moment
before
she
had
believed
herself
to
be
perfectly
happy
now
it
was
the
worst
part
of
her
anguish
that
it
did
not
really
surprise
her
she
knew
so
well
how
it
must
have
happened
the
letters
had
reached
him
when
he
was
busy
occupied
with
something
else
and
had
been
put
aside
to
be
read
at
some
future
time
a
time
which
never
came
perhaps
on
his
way
to
america
on
the
steamer
even
he
had
met
some
one
else
the
some
one
who
lurks
veiled
and
ominous
in
the
background
of
every
woman
s
thoughts
about
her
lover
or
perhaps
he
had
been
merely
forgetful
she
had
learned
from
experience
that
the
sensations
which
he
seemed
to
feel
with
the
most
exquisite
intensity
left
no
reverberations
in
his
mind
that
he
did
not
relive
either
his
pleasures
or
his
pains
she
needed
no
better
proof
of
that
than
the
lightness
of
his
conduct
toward
his
daughter
he
seemed
to
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
juliet
would
remain
indefinitely
with
the
friends
who
had
received
her
after
her
mother
s
death
and
it
was
at
lizzie
s
suggestion
that
the
little
girl
was
brought
home
and
that
they
had
established
themselves
at
neuilly
to
be
near
her
school
but
juliet
once
with
them
he
became
the
model
of
a
tender
father
and
lizzie
wondered
that
he
had
not
felt
the
child
s
absence
since
he
seemed
so
affectionately
aware
of
her
presence
lizzie
had
noted
all
this
in
juliet
s
case
but
had
taken
for
granted
that
her
own
was
different
that
she
formed
for
deering
the
exception
which
every
woman
secretly
supposes
herself
to
form
in
the
experience
of
the
man
she
loves
certainly
she
had
learned
by
this
time
that
she
could
not
modify
his
habits
but
she
imagined
that
she
had
deepened
his
sensibilities
had
furnished
him
with
an
ideal
angelic
function
and
she
now
saw
that
the
fact
of
her
letters
her
unanswered
letters
having
on
his
own
assurance
meant
so
much
to
him
had
been
the
basis
on
which
this
beautiful
fabric
was
reared
there
they
lay
now
the
letters
precisely
as
when
they
had
left
her
hands
he
had
not
had
time
to
read
them
and
there
had
been
a
moment
in
her
past
when
that
discovery
would
have
been
the
sharpest
pang
imaginable
to
her
heart
she
had
traveled
far
beyond
that
point
she
could
have
forgiven
him
now
for
having
forgotten
her
but
she
could
never
forgive
him
for
having
deceived
her
she
sat
down
and
looked
again
vaguely
about
the
room
suddenly
she
heard
his
step
overhead
and
her
heart
contracted
she
was
afraid
he
was
coming
down
to
her
she
sprang
up
and
bolted
the
door
then
she
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
tremulous
and
exhausted
as
if
the
pushing
of
the
bolt
had
required
an
immense
muscular
effort
a
moment
later
she
heard
him
on
the
stairs
and
her
tremor
broke
into
a
cold
fit
of
shaking
i
loathe
you
i
loathe
you
she
cried
she
listened
apprehensively
for
his
touch
on
the
handle
of
the
door
he
would
come
in
humming
a
tune
to
ask
some
idle
question
and
lay
a
caress
on
her
hair
but
no
the
door
was
bolted
she
was
safe
she
continued
to
listen
and
the
step
passed
on
he
had
not
been
coming
to
her
then
he
must
have
gone
to
fetch
something
another
newspaper
perhaps
he
seemed
to
read
little
else
and
she
sometimes
wondered
when
he
had
found
time
to
store
the
material
that
used
to
serve
for
their
famous
literary
talks
the
wonder
shot
through
her
again
barbed
with
a
sneer
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
everything
he
had
ever
done
and
been
was
a
lie
she
heard
the
close
and
started
up
was
he
going
out
it
was
not
his
habit
to
leave
the
house
in
the
morning
she
crossed
the
room
to
the
window
and
saw
him
walking
with
a
quick
decided
step
between
the
budding
lilacs
to
the
gate
what
could
have
called
him
forth
at
that
unwonted
hour
it
was
odd
that
he
should
not
have
told
her
the
fact
that
she
thought
it
odd
suddenly
showed
her
how
closely
their
lives
were
interwoven
she
had
become
a
habit
to
him
and
he
was
fond
of
his
habits
but
to
her
it
was
as
if
a
stranger
had
opened
the
gate
and
gone
out
she
wondered
what
he
would
feel
if
he
knew
that
she
felt
in
an
hour
he
will
know
she
said
to
herself
with
a
kind
of
fierce
exultation
and
immediately
she
began
to
dramatize
the
scene
as
soon
as
he
came
in
she
meant
to
call
him
up
to
her
room
and
hand
him
the
letters
without
a
word
for
a
moment
she
gloated
on
the
picture
then
her
imagination
recoiled
from
it
she
was
humiliated
by
the
thought
of
humiliating
him
she
wanted
to
keep
his
image
intact
she
would
not
see
him
he
had
lied
to
her
about
her
letters
had
lied
to
her
when
he
found
it
to
his
interest
to
regain
her
favor
yes
there
was
the
point
to
hold
fast
he
had
sought
her
out
when
he
learned
that
she
was
rich
perhaps
he
had
come
back
from
america
on
purpose
to
marry
her
no
doubt
he
had
come
back
on
purpose
it
was
incredible
that
she
had
not
seen
this
at
the
time
she
turned
sick
at
the
thought
of
her
fatuity
and
of
the
grossness
of
his
arts
well
the
event
proved
that
they
were
all
he
needed
but
why
had
he
gone
out
at
such
an
hour
she
was
irritated
to
find
herself
still
preoccupied
by
his
comings
and
goings
turning
from
the
window
she
sat
down
again
she
wondered
what
she
meant
to
do
next
no
she
would
not
show
him
the
letters
she
would
simply
leave
them
on
his
table
and
go
away
she
would
leave
the
house
with
her
boy
and
andora
it
was
a
relief
to
feel
a
definite
plan
forming
itself
in
her
mind
something
that
her
uprooted
thoughts
could
fasten
on
she
would
go
away
of
course
and
meanwhile
in
order
not
to
see
him
she
would
feign
a
headache
and
remain
in
her
room
till
after
luncheon
then
she
and
andora
would
pack
a
few
things
and
fly
with
the
child
while
he
was
dawdling
about
in
the
studio
when
one
s
house
fell
one
fled
from
the
ruins
nothing
could
be
simpler
more
inevitable
her
thoughts
were
checked
by
the
impossibility
of
picturing
what
would
happen
next
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
see
herself
and
the
child
away
from
deering
but
that
of
course
was
because
of
her
nervous
weakness
she
had
youth
money
energy
all
the
trumps
were
on
her
side
it
was
much
more
difficult
to
imagine
what
would
become
of
deering
he
was
so
dependent
on
her
and
they
had
been
so
happy
together
the
fact
struck
her
as
illogical
and
even
immoral
and
yet
she
knew
he
had
been
happy
with
her
it
never
happened
like
that
in
novels
happiness
built
on
a
lie
always
crumbled
and
buried
the
presumptuous
architect
beneath
the
ruins
according
to
the
laws
of
every
novel
she
had
ever
read
deering
having
deceived
her
once
would
inevitably
have
gone
on
deceiving
her
yet
she
knew
he
had
not
gone
on
deceiving
her
she
tried
again
to
picture
her
new
life
her
friends
of
course
would
rally
about
her
but
the
prospect
left
her
cold
she
did
not
want
them
to
rally
she
wanted
only
one
thing
the
life
she
had
been
living
before
she
had
given
her
baby
the
embroidered
bag
to
play
with
oh
why
had
she
given
him
the
bag
she
had
been
so
happy
they
had
all
been
so
happy
every
nerve
in
her
clamored
for
her
lost
happiness
angrily
unreasonably
as
the
boy
had
clamored
for
his
bag
it
was
horrible
to
know
too
much
there
was
always
blood
in
the
foundations
parents
kept
things
from
children
protected
them
from
all
the
dark
secrets
of
pain
and
evil
and
was
any
life
livable
unless
it
were
thus
protected
could
any
one
look
in
the
medusa
s
face
and
live
but
why
should
she
leave
the
house
since
it
was
hers
here
with
her
boy
and
andora
she
could
still
make
for
herself
the
semblance
of
a
life
it
was
deering
who
would
have
to
go
he
would
understand
that
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
letters
she
pictured
him
in
the
act
of
going
leaving
the
house
as
he
had
left
it
just
now
she
saw
the
gate
closing
on
him
for
the
last
time
now
her
vision
was
acute
enough
she
saw
him
as
distinctly
as
if
he
were
in
the
room
ah
he
would
not
like
returning
to
the
old
life
of
privations
and
expedients
and
yet
she
knew
he
would
not
plead
with
her
suddenly
a
new
thought
rushed
through
her
mind
what
if
andora
had
rushed
to
him
with
the
tale
of
the
discovery
of
the
letters
with
the
fly
you
are
discovered
of
romantic
fiction
what
if
he
left
her
for
good
it
would
not
be
unlike
him
after
all
under
his
wonderful
gentleness
he
was
always
evasive
and
inscrutable
he
might
have
said
to
himself
that
he
would
forestall
her
action
and
place
himself
at
once
on
the
defensive
it
might
be
that
she
seen
him
go
out
of
the
gate
for
the
last
time
she
looked
about
the
room
again
as
if
this
thought
had
given
it
a
new
aspect
yes
this
alone
could
explain
her
husband
s
going
out
it
was
past
twelve
o
clock
their
usual
luncheon
hour
and
he
was
scrupulously
punctual
at
meals
and
gently
reproachful
if
she
kept
him
waiting
only
some
unwonted
event
could
have
caused
him
to
leave
the
house
at
such
an
hour
and
with
such
marks
of
haste
well
perhaps
it
was
better
that
andora
should
have
spoken
she
mistrusted
her
own
courage
she
almost
hoped
the
deed
had
been
done
for
her
yet
her
next
sensation
was
one
of
confused
resentment
she
said
to
herself
why
has
andora
interfered
she
felt
baffled
and
angry
as
though
her
prey
had
escaped
her
if
deering
had
been
in
the
house
she
would
have
gone
to
him
instantly
and
overwhelmed
him
with
her
scorn
but
he
had
gone
out
and
she
did
not
know
where
he
had
gone
and
oddly
mingled
with
her
anger
against
him
was
the
latent
instinct
of
vigilance
the
solicitude
of
the
woman
accustomed
to
watch
over
the
man
she
loves
it
would
be
strange
never
to
feel
that
solicitude
again
never
to
hear
him
say
with
his
hand
on
her
hair
why
you
foolish
child
were
you
worried
am
i
late
the
sense
of
his
touch
was
so
real
that
she
stiffened
herself
against
it
flinging
back
her
head
as
if
to
throw
off
his
hand
the
mere
thought
of
his
caress
was
hateful
yet
she
felt
it
in
all
her
traitorous
veins
yes
she
felt
it
but
with
horror
and
repugnance
it
was
something
she
wanted
to
escape
from
and
the
fact
of
struggling
against
it
was
what
made
its
hold
so
strong
it
was
as
though
her
mind
were
sounding
her
body
to
make
sure
of
its
allegiance
spying
on
it
for
any
secret
movement
of
revolt
to
escape
from
the
sensation
she
rose
and
went
again
to
the
window
no
one
was
in
sight
but
presently
the
gate
began
to
swing
back
and
her
heart
gave
a
leap
she
knew
not
whether
up
or
down
a
moment
later
the
gate
opened
slowly
to
admit
a
perambulator
propelled
by
the
nurse
and
flanked
by
juliet
and
andora
lizzie
s
eyes
rested
on
the
familiar
group
as
if
she
had
never
seen
it
before
and
she
stood
motionless
instead
of
flying
down
to
meet
the
children
suddenly
there
was
a
step
on
the
stairs
and
she
heard
andora
s
agitated
knock
she
unbolted
the
door
and
was
strained
to
her
friend
s
emaciated
bosom
my
darling
miss
macy
cried
remember
you
have
your
child
and
me
lizzie
loosened
herself
gently
she
looked
at
andora
with
a
feeling
of
estrangement
which
she
could
not
explain
have
you
spoken
to
my
husband
she
asked
drawing
coldly
back
spoken
to
him
andora
stared
at
her
in
genuine
wonder
then
you
haven
t
met
him
since
he
left
me
no
my
love
is
he
out
i
haven
t
met
lizzie
sat
down
with
a
confused
sense
of
relief
which
welled
up
to
her
throat
and
made
speech
difficult
suddenly
light
came
to
andora
i
understand
dearest
you
don
t
feel
able
to
see
him
yourself
you
want
me
to
go
to
him
for
she
looked
about
her
scenting
the
battle
you
re
right
darling
as
soon
as
he
comes
in
i
ll
go
to
him
the
sooner
we
get
it
over
the
she
followed
lizzie
who
without
answering
her
had
turned
mechanically
back
to
the
window
as
they
stood
there
the
gate
moved
again
and
deering
entered
the
garden
there
he
is
now
lizzie
felt
andora
s
fervent
clutch
upon
her
arm
where
are
the
letters
i
will
go
down
at
once
you
allow
me
to
speak
for
you
you
trust
my
woman
s
heart
oh
believe
me
darling
miss
macy
panted
i
shall
know
just
what
to
say
to
him
what
to
say
to
him
lizzie
absently
repeated
as
her
husband
advanced
up
the
path
she
had
a
sudden
trembling
vision
of
their
three
years
together
those
years
were
her
whole
life
everything
before
them
had
been
colorless
and
unconscious
like
the
blind
life
of
the
plant
before
it
reaches
the
surface
of
the
soil
they
had
not
been
exactly
what
she
dreamed
but
if
they
had
taken
away
certain
illusions
they
had
left
richer
realities
in
their
stead
she
understood
now
that
she
had
gradually
adjusted
herself
to
the
new
image
of
her
husband
as
he
was
as
he
would
always
be
he
was
not
the
hero
of
her
dream
but
he
was
the
man
she
loved
and
who
had
loved
her
for
she
saw
now
in
this
last
wide
flash
of
pity
and
initiation
that
as
a
solid
marble
may
be
made
out
of
worthless
scraps
of
mortar
glass
and
pebbles
so
out
of
mean
mixed
substances
may
be
fashioned
a
love
that
will
bear
the
stress
of
life
more
urgently
she
felt
the
pressure
of
miss
macy
s
hand
i
shall
hand
him
the
letters
without
a
word
you
may
rely
love
on
my
sense
of
dignity
i
know
everything
you
re
feeling
at
this
moment
deering
had
reached
the
lizzie
continued
to
watch
him
in
silence
till
he
disappeared
under
the
glazed
roof
of
the
porch
below
the
window
then
she
turned
and
looked
almost
compassionately
at
her
friend
oh
poor
andora
you
don
t
know
anything
you
don
t
know
anything
at
all
she
said
the
end
