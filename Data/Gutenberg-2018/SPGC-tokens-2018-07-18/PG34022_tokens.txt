modes
of
holding
and
apprehending
propositions
modes
of
holding
propositions
propositions
consisting
of
a
subject
and
predicate
united
by
the
copula
may
take
a
categorical
conditional
or
interrogative
form
an
interrogative
when
they
ask
a
question
does
benefit
the
poorer
classes
and
imply
the
possibility
of
an
affirmative
or
negative
resolution
of
it
a
conditional
when
they
express
a
conclusion
therefore
benefits
the
poorer
classes
and
both
imply
and
imply
their
dependence
on
other
propositions
a
categorical
when
they
simply
make
an
assertion
does
benefit
and
imply
the
absence
of
any
condition
or
reservation
of
any
kind
looking
neither
before
nor
behind
as
resting
in
themselves
and
being
intrinsically
complete
these
three
modes
of
shaping
a
proposition
distinct
as
they
are
from
each
other
follow
each
other
in
natural
sequence
a
proposition
which
starts
with
being
a
question
may
become
a
conclusion
and
then
be
changed
into
an
assertion
but
it
has
of
course
ceased
to
be
a
question
so
far
forth
as
it
has
become
a
conclusion
and
has
rid
itself
of
its
argumentative
is
has
ceased
to
be
a
conclusion
far
forth
as
it
has
become
an
assertion
a
question
has
not
yet
got
so
far
as
to
be
a
conclusion
though
it
is
the
necessary
preliminary
of
a
conclusion
and
an
assertion
has
got
beyond
being
a
mere
conclusion
though
it
is
the
natural
issue
of
a
conclusion
their
correlation
is
the
measure
of
their
distinction
one
from
another
no
one
is
likely
to
deny
that
a
question
is
distinct
both
from
a
conclusion
and
from
an
assertion
and
an
assertion
will
be
found
to
be
equally
distinct
from
a
conclusion
for
if
we
rest
our
affirmation
on
arguments
this
shows
that
we
are
not
asserting
and
when
we
assert
we
do
not
argue
an
assertion
is
as
distinct
from
a
conclusion
as
a
word
of
command
is
from
a
persuasion
or
recommendation
command
and
assertion
as
such
both
of
them
in
their
different
ways
dispense
with
discard
ignore
antecedents
of
any
kind
though
antecedents
may
have
been
a
quâ
condition
of
their
being
elicited
they
both
carry
with
them
the
pretension
of
being
personal
acts
in
insisting
on
the
intrinsic
distinctness
of
these
three
modes
of
putting
a
proposition
i
am
not
maintaining
that
they
may
not
as
regards
one
and
the
same
subject
for
what
we
have
already
concluded
we
may
if
we
will
make
a
question
of
and
what
we
are
asserting
we
may
of
course
conclude
over
again
we
may
assert
to
one
man
and
conclude
to
another
and
ask
of
a
third
still
when
we
assert
we
do
not
conclude
and
when
we
assert
or
conclude
we
do
not
question
the
internal
act
of
holding
propositions
is
for
the
most
part
analogous
to
the
external
act
of
enunciating
them
as
there
are
three
ways
of
enunciating
so
are
there
three
ways
of
holding
them
each
corresponding
to
each
these
three
mental
acts
are
doubt
inference
and
assent
a
question
is
the
expression
of
a
doubt
a
conclusion
is
the
expression
of
an
act
of
inference
and
an
assertion
is
the
expression
of
an
act
of
assent
to
doubt
for
instance
is
not
to
see
one
s
way
to
hold
that
is
or
that
it
is
not
a
benefit
to
infer
is
to
hold
on
sufficient
grounds
that
may
must
or
should
be
a
benefit
to
assent
to
the
proposition
is
to
hold
that
is
a
benefit
moreover
propositions
while
they
are
the
material
of
these
three
enunciations
are
the
objects
of
the
three
corresponding
mental
acts
and
as
without
a
proposition
there
can
not
be
a
question
conclusion
or
assertion
so
without
a
proposition
there
is
nothing
to
doubt
about
nothing
to
infer
nothing
to
assent
to
mental
acts
of
whatever
kind
presuppose
their
objects
and
since
the
three
enunciations
are
distinct
from
each
other
therefore
the
three
mental
acts
also
doubt
inference
and
assent
are
with
reference
to
one
and
the
same
proposition
distinct
from
each
other
else
why
should
their
several
enunciations
be
distinct
and
indeed
it
is
very
evident
that
so
far
forth
as
we
infer
we
do
not
doubt
and
that
when
we
assent
we
are
not
inferring
and
when
we
doubt
we
can
not
assent
and
in
fact
these
three
modes
of
entertaining
propositions
them
inferring
them
assenting
to
them
are
so
distinct
in
their
action
that
when
they
are
severally
carried
out
into
the
intellectual
habits
of
an
individual
they
become
the
principles
and
notes
of
three
distinct
states
or
characters
of
mind
for
instance
in
the
case
of
revealed
religion
according
as
one
or
other
of
these
is
paramount
within
him
a
man
is
a
sceptic
as
regards
it
or
a
philosopher
thinking
it
more
or
less
probable
considered
as
a
conclusion
of
reason
or
he
has
an
unhesitating
faith
in
it
and
is
recognized
as
a
believer
if
he
simply
disbelieves
or
dissents
he
is
assenting
to
the
contradictory
of
the
thesis
viz
that
there
is
no
revelation
many
minds
of
course
there
are
which
are
not
under
the
predominant
influence
of
any
one
of
the
three
thus
men
are
to
be
found
of
irreflective
impulsive
unsettled
or
again
of
acute
minds
who
do
not
know
what
they
believe
and
what
they
do
not
and
who
may
be
by
turns
sceptics
inquirers
or
believers
who
doubt
assent
infer
and
doubt
again
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
season
nay
further
in
all
minds
there
is
a
certain
coexistence
of
these
distinct
acts
that
is
of
two
of
them
for
we
can
at
once
infer
and
assent
though
we
can
not
at
once
either
assent
or
infer
and
also
doubt
indeed
in
a
multitude
of
cases
we
infer
truths
or
apparent
truths
before
and
while
and
after
we
assent
to
them
lastly
it
can
not
be
denied
that
these
three
acts
are
all
natural
to
the
mind
i
mean
that
in
exercising
them
we
are
not
violating
the
laws
of
our
nature
as
if
they
were
in
themselves
an
extravagance
or
weakness
but
are
acting
according
to
it
according
to
its
legitimate
constitution
undoubtedly
it
is
possible
it
is
common
in
the
particular
case
to
err
in
the
exercise
of
doubt
of
inference
and
of
assent
that
is
we
may
be
withholding
a
judgment
about
propositions
on
which
we
have
the
means
of
coming
to
some
definitive
conclusion
or
we
may
be
assenting
to
propositions
which
we
ought
to
receive
only
on
the
credit
of
their
premisses
or
again
to
keep
ourselves
in
suspense
about
but
such
errors
of
the
individual
belong
to
the
individual
not
to
his
nature
and
can
not
avail
to
forfeit
for
him
his
natural
right
under
proper
circumstances
to
doubt
or
to
infer
or
to
assent
we
do
but
fulfil
our
nature
in
doubting
inferring
and
assenting
and
our
duty
is
not
to
abstain
from
the
exercise
of
any
function
of
our
nature
but
to
do
what
is
in
itself
right
rightly
so
far
in
general
this
essay
i
treat
of
propositions
only
in
their
bearing
upon
concrete
matter
and
i
am
mainly
concerned
with
assent
with
inference
in
its
relation
to
assent
and
only
such
inference
as
is
not
demonstration
with
doubt
hardly
at
all
i
dismiss
doubt
with
one
observation
i
have
here
spoken
of
it
simply
as
a
suspense
of
mind
in
which
sense
of
the
word
to
have
no
doubt
about
a
thesis
is
equivalent
to
one
or
other
of
the
two
remaining
acts
either
to
inferring
it
or
else
assenting
to
it
however
the
word
is
often
taken
to
mean
the
deliberate
recognition
of
a
thesis
as
being
uncertain
in
this
sense
doubt
is
nothing
else
than
an
assent
viz
an
assent
to
a
proposition
at
variance
with
the
thesis
as
i
have
already
noticed
in
the
case
of
disbelief
confining
myself
to
the
subject
of
assent
and
inference
i
observe
two
points
of
contrast
between
them
the
first
i
have
already
noted
assent
is
unconditional
else
it
is
not
really
represented
by
assertion
inference
is
conditional
because
a
conclusion
at
least
implies
the
assumption
of
premisses
and
still
more
because
in
concrete
matter
on
which
i
am
engaged
demonstration
is
impossible
the
second
has
regard
to
the
apprehension
necessary
for
holding
a
proposition
we
can
not
assent
to
a
proposition
without
some
intelligent
apprehension
of
it
whereas
we
need
not
understand
it
at
all
in
order
to
infer
it
we
can
not
give
our
assent
to
the
proposition
that
x
is
z
till
we
are
told
something
about
one
or
other
of
the
terms
but
we
can
infer
if
x
is
y
and
y
is
z
that
x
is
z
whether
we
know
the
meaning
of
x
and
z
or
no
these
points
of
contrast
and
their
results
will
come
before
us
in
due
course
here
for
a
time
leaving
the
consideration
of
the
modes
of
holding
propositions
i
proceed
to
inquire
into
what
is
to
be
understood
by
apprehending
them
modes
of
apprehending
propositions
by
our
apprehension
of
propositions
i
mean
our
imposition
of
a
sense
on
the
terms
of
which
they
are
composed
now
what
do
the
terms
of
a
proposition
the
subject
and
predicate
stand
for
sometimes
they
stand
for
certain
ideas
existing
in
our
own
minds
and
for
nothing
outside
of
them
sometimes
for
things
simply
external
to
us
brought
home
to
us
through
the
experiences
and
informations
we
have
of
them
all
things
in
the
exterior
world
are
unit
and
individual
and
are
nothing
else
but
the
mind
not
only
contemplates
those
unit
realities
as
they
exist
but
has
the
gift
by
an
act
of
creation
of
bringing
before
it
abstractions
and
generalizations
which
have
no
existence
no
counterpart
out
of
it
now
there
are
propositions
in
which
one
or
both
of
the
terms
are
common
nouns
as
standing
for
what
is
abstract
general
and
such
as
man
is
an
animal
some
men
are
learned
an
apostle
is
a
creation
of
christianity
a
line
is
length
without
breadth
to
err
is
human
to
forgive
these
i
shall
call
notional
propositions
and
the
apprehension
with
which
we
infer
or
assent
to
them
notional
and
there
are
other
propositions
which
are
composed
of
singular
nouns
and
of
which
the
terms
stand
for
things
external
to
us
unit
and
individual
as
philip
was
the
father
of
alexander
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
the
apostles
first
preached
to
the
jews
and
these
i
shall
call
real
propositions
and
their
apprehension
real
there
are
then
two
apprehensions
or
interpretations
to
which
propositions
may
be
subjected
notional
and
real
next
i
observe
that
the
same
proposition
may
admit
of
both
of
these
interpretations
at
once
having
a
notional
sense
as
used
by
one
man
and
a
real
as
used
by
another
thus
a
schoolboy
may
perfectly
apprehend
and
construe
with
spirit
the
poet
s
words
dum
capitolium
scandet
cum
tacitâ
virgine
pontifex
he
has
seen
steep
hills
flights
of
steps
and
processions
he
knows
what
enforced
silence
is
also
he
knows
all
about
the
pontifex
maximus
and
the
vestal
virgins
he
has
an
abstract
hold
upon
every
word
of
the
description
yet
without
the
words
therefore
bringing
before
him
at
all
the
living
image
which
they
would
light
up
in
the
mind
of
a
contemporary
of
the
poet
who
had
seen
the
fact
described
or
of
a
modern
historian
who
had
duly
informed
himself
in
the
religious
phenomena
and
by
meditation
had
realized
the
roman
ceremonial
of
the
age
of
augustus
again
dulce
et
decorum
est
pro
patriâ
mori
is
a
mere
a
terse
expression
of
abstractions
in
the
mind
of
the
poet
himself
if
philippi
is
to
be
the
index
of
his
patriotism
whereas
it
would
be
the
record
of
experiences
a
sovereign
dogma
a
grand
aspiration
inflaming
the
imagination
piercing
the
heart
of
a
wallace
or
a
tell
as
the
multitude
of
common
nouns
have
originally
been
singular
it
is
not
surprising
that
many
of
them
should
so
remain
still
in
the
apprehension
of
particular
individuals
in
the
proposition
sugar
is
sweet
the
predicate
is
a
common
noun
as
used
by
those
who
have
compared
sugar
in
their
thoughts
with
honey
or
glycerine
but
it
may
be
the
only
distinctively
sweet
thing
in
the
experience
of
a
child
and
may
be
used
by
him
as
a
noun
singular
the
first
time
that
he
tastes
sugar
if
his
nurse
says
sugar
is
sweet
in
a
notional
sense
meaning
by
sugar
powdered
brown
and
candied
and
by
sweet
a
specific
flavour
or
scent
which
is
found
in
many
articles
of
food
and
many
flowers
he
may
answer
in
a
real
sense
and
in
an
individual
proposition
sugar
is
sweet
meaning
this
sugar
is
this
sweet
thirdly
in
the
same
mind
and
at
the
same
time
the
same
proposition
may
express
both
what
is
notional
and
what
is
real
when
a
lecturer
in
mechanics
or
chemistry
shows
to
his
class
by
experiment
some
physical
fact
he
and
his
hearers
at
once
enunciate
it
as
an
individual
thing
before
their
eyes
and
also
as
generalized
by
their
minds
into
a
law
of
nature
when
virgil
says
varium
et
mutabile
semper
fœmina
he
both
sets
before
his
readers
what
he
means
to
be
a
general
truth
and
at
the
same
time
applies
it
individually
to
the
instance
of
dido
he
expresses
at
once
a
notion
and
a
fact
of
these
two
modes
of
apprehending
propositions
notional
and
real
real
is
the
stronger
i
mean
by
stronger
the
more
vivid
and
forcible
it
is
so
to
be
accounted
for
the
very
reason
that
it
is
concerned
with
what
is
either
real
or
taken
for
real
for
intellectual
ideas
can
not
compete
in
effectiveness
with
the
experience
of
concrete
facts
various
proverbs
and
maxims
sanction
me
in
so
speaking
such
as
facts
are
stubborn
things
experientia
docet
seeing
is
believing
and
the
popular
contrast
between
theory
and
practice
reason
and
sight
philosophy
and
faith
not
that
real
apprehension
as
such
impels
to
action
any
more
than
notional
but
it
excites
and
stimulates
the
affections
and
passions
by
bringing
facts
home
to
them
as
motive
causes
thus
it
indirectly
brings
about
what
the
apprehension
of
large
principles
of
general
laws
or
of
moral
obligations
never
could
effect
reverting
to
the
two
modes
of
holding
propositions
conditional
and
unconditional
which
was
the
subject
of
the
former
section
that
is
inferences
and
assents
i
observe
that
inferences
which
are
conditional
acts
are
especially
cognate
to
notional
apprehension
and
assents
which
are
unconditional
to
real
this
distinction
too
will
come
before
us
in
the
course
of
the
following
chapters
and
now
i
have
stated
the
main
subjects
of
which
i
propose
to

questions
which

involve
chapter
ii
assent
considered
as
apprehensive
i
have
already
said
of
an
act
of
assent
first
that
it
is
in
itself
the
absolute
acceptance
of
a
proposition
without
any
condition
and
next
that
in
order
to
its
being
made
it
presupposes
the
condition
not
only
of
some
previous
inference
in
favour
of
the
proposition
but
especially
of
some
concomitant
apprehension
of
its
terms
i
proceed
to
the
latter
of
these
two
subjects
that
is
of
assent
considered
as
apprehensive
leaving
the
discussion
of
assent
as
unconditional
for
a
later
place
in
this
essay
by
apprehension
of
a
proposition
i
mean
as
i
have
already
said
the
interpretation
given
to
the
terms
of
which
it
is
composed
when
we
infer
we
consider
a
proposition
in
relation
to
other
propositions
when
we
assent
to
it
we
consider
it
for
its
own
sake
and
in
its
intrinsic
sense
that
sense
must
be
in
some
degree
known
to
us
else
we
do
but
assert
the
proposition
we
in
no
wise
assent
to
it
assent
i
have
described
to
be
a
mental
assertion
in
its
very
nature
then
it
is
of
the
mind
and
not
of
the
lips
we
can
assert
without
assenting
assent
is
more
than
assertion
just
by
this
much
that
it
is
accompanied
by
some
apprehension
of
the
matter
asserted
this
is
plain
and
the
only
question
is
what
measure
of
apprehension
is
sufficient
and
the
answer
to
this
question
is
equally
plain
is
the
predicate
of
the
proposition
which
must
be
apprehended
in
a
proposition
one
term
is
predicated
of
another
the
subject
is
referred
to
the
predicate
and
the
predicate
gives
us
information
about
the
subject
to
apprehend
the
proposition
is
to
have
that
information
and
to
assent
to
it
is
to
acquiesce
in
it
as
true
therefore
i
apprehend
a
proposition
when
i
apprehend
its
predicate
the
subject
itself
need
not
be
apprehended
in
order
to
a
genuine
assent
for
it
is
the
very
thing
which
the
predicate
has
to
elucidate
and
therefore
by
its
formal
place
in
the
proposition
so
far
as
it
is
the
subject
it
is
something
unknown
something
which
the
predicate
makes
known
but
the
predicate
can
not
make
it
known
unless
it
is
known
itself
let
the
question
be
what
is
trade
here
is
a
distinct
profession
of
ignorance
about
trade
and
let
the
answer
be
trade
is
the
interchange
of
goods
then
need
not
be
known
as
a
condition
of
assent
to
the
proposition
except
so
far
as
the
account
of
it
which
is
given
in
answer
the
interchange
of
goods
makes
it
known
and
that
must
be
apprehended
in
order
to
make
it
known
the
very
drift
of
the
proposition
is
to
tell
us
something
about
the
subject
but
there
is
no
reason
why
our
knowledge
of
the
subject
whatever
it
is
should
go
beyond
what
the
predicate
tells
us
about
it
further
than
this
the
subject
need
not
be
apprehended
as
far
as
this
it
must
it
will
not
be
apprehended
thus
far
unless
we
apprehend
the
predicate
if
a
child
asks
what
is
lucern
and
is
answered
lucern
is
medicago
sativa
of
the
class
diadelphia
and
order
decandria
and
henceforth
says
obediently
lucern
is
medicago
sativa
he
makes
no
act
of
assent
to
the
proposition
which
he
enunciates
but
speaks
like
a
parrot
but
if
he
is
told
lucern
is
food
for
cattle
and
is
shown
cows
grazing
in
a
meadow
then
though
he
never
saw
lucern
and
knows
nothing
at
all
about
it
besides
what
he
has
learned
from
the
predicate
he
is
in
a
position
to
make
as
genuine
an
assent
to
the
proposition
lucern
is
food
for
cattle
on
the
word
of
his
informant
as
if
he
knew
ever
so
much
more
about
lucern
and
as
soon
as
he
has
got
as
far
as
this
he
may
go
further
he
now
knows
enough
about
lucern
to
enable
him
to
apprehend
propositions
which
have
lucern
for
their
predicate
should
they
come
before
him
for
assent
as
that
field
is
sown
with
lucern
or
clover
is
not
yet
there
is
a
way
in
which
the
child
can
give
an
indirect
assent
even
to
a
proposition
in
which
he
understood
neither
subject
nor
predicate
he
can
not
indeed
in
that
case
assent
to
the
proposition
itself
but
he
can
assent
to
its
truth
he
can
not
do
more
than
assert
that
lucern
is
medicago
sativa
but
he
can
assent
to
the
proposition
that
lucern
is
medicago
sativa
is
for
here
is
a
predicate
which
he
sufficiently
apprehends
what
is
inapprehensible
in
the
proposition
being
confined
to
the
subject
thus
the
child
s
mother
might
teach
him
to
repeat
a
passage
of
shakespeare
and
when
he
asked
the
meaning
of
a
particular
line
such
as
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
strained
or
virtue
itself
turns
vice
being
misapplied
she
might
answer
him
that
he
was
too
young
to
understand
it
yet
but
that
it
had
a
beautiful
meaning
as
he
would
one
day
know
and
he
in
faith
on
her
word
might
give
his
assent
to
such
a
proposition
that
is
to
the
line
itself
which
he
had
got
by
heart
and
which
would
be
beyond
him
but
to
its
being
true
beautiful
and
good
of
course
i
am
speaking
of
assent
itself
and
its
intrinsic
conditions
not
of
the
ground
or
motive
of
it
whether
there
is
an
obligation
upon
the
child
to
trust
his
mother
or
whether
there
are
cases
where
such
trust
is
impossible
are
irrelevant
questions
and
i
notice
them
in
order
to
put
them
aside
i
am
examining
the
act
of
assent
itself
not
its
preliminaries
and
i
have
specified
three
directions
which
among
others
the
assent
may
take
viz
assent
immediately
to
a
proposition
assent
to
its
truth
and
assent
both
to
its
truth
and
to
the
ground
of
its
being
true
together
lucern
is
food
for
cattle
that
lucern
is
medicago
sativa
is
true
my
mother
s
word
that
lucern
is
medicago
sativa
and
is
food
for
cattle
is
the
now
in
each
of
these
there
is
one
and
the
same
absolute
adhesion
of
the
mind
to
the
proposition
on
the
part
of
the
child
he
assents
to
the
apprehensible
proposition
and
to
the
truth
of
the
inapprehensible
and
to
the
veracity
of
his
mother
in
her
assertion
of
the
inapprehensible
i
say
the
same
absolute
adhesion
because
unless
he
did
assent
without
any
reserve
to
the
proposition
that
lucern
was
food
for
cattle
or
to
the
accuracy
of
the
botanical
name
and
description
of
it
he
would
not
be
giving
an
unreserved
assent
to
his
mother
s
word
yet
though
these
assents
are
all
unreserved
still
they
certainly
differ
in
strength
and
this
is
the
next
point
to
which
i
wish
to
draw
attention
it
is
indeed
plain
that
though
the
child
assents
to
his
mother
s
veracity
without
perhaps
being
conscious
of
his
own
act
nevertheless
that
particular
assent
of
his
has
a
force
and
life
in
it
which
the
other
assents
have
not
insomuch
as
he
apprehends
the
proposition
which
is
the
subject
of
it
with
greater
keenness
and
energy
than
belongs
to
his
apprehension
of
the
others
her
veracity
and
authority
is
to
him
no
abstract
truth
or
item
of
general
knowledge
but
is
bound
up
with
that
image
and
love
of
her
person
which
is
part
of
himself
and
makes
a
direct
claim
on
him
for
his
summary
assent
to
her
general
teachings
accordingly
by
reason
of
this
circumstance
of
his
apprehension
he
would
not
hesitate
to
say
did
his
years
admit
of
it
that
he
would
lay
down
his
life
in
defence
of
his
mother
s
veracity
on
the
other
hand
he
would
not
make
such
a
profession
in
the
case
of
the
propositions
lucern
is
food
for
cattle
or
that
lucern
is
medicago
sativa
is
true
and
yet
it
is
clear
too
that
if
he
did
in
truth
assent
to
these
propositions
he
would
have
to
die
for
them
also
rather
than
deny
them
when
it
came
to
the
point
unless
he
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
a
falsehood
that
he
would
have
to
die
for
all
three
propositions
severally
rather
than
deny
them
shows
the
completeness
and
absoluteness
of
assent
in
its
very
nature
that
he
would
not
spontaneously
challenge
so
severe
a
trial
in
the
case
of
two
out
of
the
three
particular
acts
of
assent
illustrates
in
what
sense
one
assent
may
be
stronger
than
another
it
appears
then
that
in
assenting
to
propositions
an
apprehension
in
some
sense
of
their
terms
is
not
only
necessary
to
assent
as
such
but
also
gives
a
distinct
character
to
its
acts
if
therefore
we
would
know
more
about
assent
we
must
know
more
about
the
apprehension
which
accompanies
it
accordingly
to
the
subject
of
apprehension
i
proceed
chapter
iii
the
apprehension
of
propositions
i
said
in
my
introductory
chapter
that
there
can
be
no
assent
to
a
proposition
without
some
sort
of
apprehension
of
its
terms
next
that
there
are
two
modes
of
apprehension
notional
and
real
thirdly
that
while
assent
may
be
given
to
a
proposition
on
either
apprehension
of
it
still
its
acts
are
elicited
more
heartily
and
forcibly
when
they
are
made
upon
real
apprehension
which
has
things
for
its
objects
than
when
they
are
made
in
favour
of
notions
and
with
a
notional
apprehension
the
first
of
these
three
points
i
have
just
been
discussing
now
i
will
proceed
to
the
second
viz
the
two
modes
of
apprehending
propositions
leaving
the
third
for
the
chapters
which
follow
i
have
used
the
word
and
not
because
the
latter
word
is
of
uncertain
meaning
standing
sometimes
for
the
faculty
or
act
of
conceiving
a
proposition
sometimes
for
that
of
comprehending
it
neither
of
which
come
into
the
sense
of
it
is
possible
to
apprehend
without
understanding
i
apprehend
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
john
is
richard
s
wife
s
father
s
aunt
s
husband
but
if
i
am
unable
so
to
take
in
these
successive
relationships
as
to
understand
the
upshot
of
the
whole
viz
that
john
is
to
richard
i
can
not
be
said
to
understand
the
proposition
in
like
manner
i
may
take
a
just
view
of
a
man
s
conduct
and
therefore
apprehend
it
and
yet
may
profess
that
i
can
not
understand
it
that
is
i
have
not
the
key
to
it
and
do
not
see
its
consistency
in
detail
i
have
no
just
conception
of
it
apprehension
then
is
simply
an
intelligent
acceptance
of
the
idea
or
of
the
fact
which
a
proposition
enunciates
pride
will
have
a
fall
napoleon
died
at
helena
i
have
no
difficulty
in
entering
into
the
sentiment
contained
in
the
former
of
these
or
into
the
fact
declared
in
the
latter
that
is
i
apprehend
them
both
now
apprehension
as
i
have
said
has
two
as
language
expresses
things
external
to
us
or
our
own
thoughts
so
is
apprehension
real
or
notional
it
is
notional
in
the
grammarian
it
is
real
in
the
experimentalist
the
grammarian
has
to
determine
the
force
of
words
and
phrases
he
has
to
master
the
structure
of
sentences
and
the
composition
of
paragraphs
he
has
to
compare
language
with
language
to
ascertain
the
common
ideas
expressed
under
different
idiomatic
forms
and
to
achieve
the
difficult
work
of
recasting
the
mind
of
an
original
author
in
the
mould
of
a
translation
on
the
other
hand
the
philosopher
or
experimentalist
aims
at
investigating
questioning
ascertaining
facts
causes
effects
actions
qualities
these
are
things
and
he
makes
his
words
distinctly
subordinate
to
these
as
means
to
an
end
the
primary
duty
of
a
literary
man
is
to
have
clear
conceptions
and
to
be
exact
and
intelligible
in
expressing
them
but
in
a
philosopher
it
is
even
a
merit
to
be
not
altogether
vague
inchoate
and
obscure
in
his
teaching
and
if
he
fails
even
of
this
low
standard
of
language
we
remind
ourselves
that
his
obscurity
perhaps
is
owing
to
his
depth
no
power
of
words
in
a
lecturer
would
be
sufficient
to
make
psychology
easy
to
his
hearers
if
they
are
to
profit
by
him
they
must
throw
their
minds
into
the
matters
in
discussion
must
accompany
his
treatment
of
them
with
an
active
personal
concurrence
and
interpret
for
themselves
as
he
proceeds
the
dim
suggestions
and
adumbrations
of
objects
which
he
has
a
right
to
presuppose
while
he
uses
them
as
images
existing
in
their
apprehension
as
well
as
in
his
own
in
something
of
a
parallel
way
it
is
the
least
pardonable
fault
in
an
orator
to
fail
in
clearness
of
style
and
the
most
pardonable
fault
of
a
poet
so
again
an
economist
is
dealing
with
facts
whatever
there
is
of
theory
in
his
work
professes
to
be
founded
on
facts
by
facts
alone
must
his
sense
be
interpreted
and
to
those
only
who
are
well
furnished
with
the
necessary
facts
does
he
address
himself
yet
a
clever
schoolboy
from
a
thorough
grammatical
knowledge
of
both
languages
might
turn
into
english
a
french
treatise
on
national
wealth
produce
consumption
labour
profits
measures
of
value
public
debt
and
the
circulating
medium
with
an
apprehension
of
what
it
was
that
his
author
was
stating
sufficient
for
making
it
clear
to
an
english
reader
while
he
had
not
the
faintest
conception
himself
what
the
treatise
which
he
was
translating
really
determined
the
man
uses
language
as
the
vehicle
of
things
and
the
boy
of
abstractions
hence
in
literary
examinations
it
is
a
test
of
good
scholarship
to
be
able
to
construe
aright
without
the
aid
of
understanding
the
sentiment
action
or
historical
occurrence
conveyed
in
the
passage
thus
accurately
rendered
let
it
be
a
battle
in
livy
or
some
subtle
train
of
thought
in
virgil
or
pindar
and
those
who
have
acquitted
themselves
best
in
the
trial
will
often
be
disposed
to
think
they
have
most
notably
failed
for
the
very
reason
that
they
have
been
too
busy
with
the
grammar
of
each
sentence
as
it
came
to
have
been
able
as
they
construed
on
to
enter
into
the
facts
or
the
feelings
which
unknown
to
themselves
they
were
bringing
out
of
it
to
take
a
very
different
instance
of
this
contrast
between
notions
and
facts
and
medicine
in
the
interests
of
science
and
as
a
protection
to
the
practitioner
veil
the
shocking
realities
of
disease
and
physical
suffering
under
a
notional
phraseology
under
the
abstract
terms
of
debility
distress
irritability
paroxysm
and
a
host
of
greek
and
latin
words
the
arts
of
medicine
and
surgery
are
necessarily
experimental
but
for
writing
and
conversing
on
these
subjects
they
require
to
be
stripped
of
the
association
of
the
facts
from
which
they
are
derived
such
are
the
two
modes
of
apprehension
the
terms
of
a
proposition
do
or
do
not
stand
for
things
if
they
do
then
they
are
singular
terms
for
all
things
that
are
are
units
but
if
they
do
not
stand
for
things
they
must
stand
for
notions
and
are
common
terms
singular
nouns
come
from
experience
common
from
abstraction
the
apprehension
of
the
former
i
call
real
and
of
the
latter
notional
now
let
us
look
at
this
difference
between
them
more
narrowly
real
apprehension
is
as
i
have
said
in
the
first
instance
an
experience
or
information
about
the
concrete
now
when
these
informations
are
in
fact
presented
to
us
that
is
when
they
are
directly
subjected
to
our
bodily
senses
or
our
mental
sensations
as
when
we
say
the
sun
shines
or
the
prospect
is
charming
or
indirectly
by
means
of
a
picture
or
even
a
narrative
then
there
is
no
difficulty
in
determining
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
our
enunciation
of
a
proposition
concerning
them
implies
an
apprehension
of
things
because
we
can
actually
point
out
the
objects
which
they
indicate
but
supposing
those
things
are
no
longer
before
us
supposing
they
have
passed
beyond
our
field
of
view
or
the
book
is
closed
in
which
the
description
of
them
occurs
how
can
an
apprehension
of
things
be
said
to
remain
to
us
it
remains
on
our
minds
by
means
of
the
faculty
of
memory
memory
consists
in
a
present
imagination
of
things
that
are
past
memory
retains
the
impressions
and
likenesses
of
what
they
were
when
before
us
and
when
we
make
use
of
the
proposition
which
refers
to
them
it
supplies
us
with
objects
by
which
to
interpret
it
they
are
things
still
as
being
the
reflections
of
things
in
a
mental
mirror
hence
the
poet
calls
memory
the
mind
s
i
am
in
a
foreign
country
among
unfamiliar
sights
at
will
i
am
able
to
conjure
up
before
me
the
vision
of
my
home
and
all
that
belongs
to
it
its
rooms
and
their
furniture
its
books
its
inmates
their
countenances
looks
and
movements
i
see
those
who
once
were
there
and
are
no
more
past
scenes
and
the
very
expression
of
the
features
and
the
tones
of
the
voices
of
those
who
took
part
in
them
in
a
time
of
trial
or
difficulty
i
create
nothing
i
see
the
facsimiles
of
facts
and
of
these
facsimiles
the
words
and
propositions
which
i
use
concerning
them
are
from
habitual
association
the
proper
or
the
sole
expression
and
so
again
i
may
have
seen
a
celebrated
painting
or
some
great
pageant
or
some
public
man
and
i
have
on
my
memory
stored
up
and
ready
at
hand
but
latent
an
impress
more
or
less
distinct
of
that
experience
the
words
the
madonna
di
sisto
or
the
last
coronation
or
the
duke
of
wellington
have
power
to
revive
that
impress
of
it
memory
has
to
do
with
individual
things
and
nothing
that
is
not
individual
and
my
apprehension
of
its
notices
is
conveyed
in
a
collection
of
singular
and
real
propositions
i
have
hitherto
been
adducing
instances
from
for
the
most
part
objects
of
sight
but
the
memory
preserves
the
impress
though
not
so
vivid
of
the
experiences
which
come
to
us
through
our
other
senses
also
the
memory
of
a
beautiful
air
or
the
scent
of
a
particular
flower
as
far
as
any
remembrance
remains
of
it
is
the
continued
presence
in
our
minds
of
a
likeness
of
it
which
its
actual
presence
has
left
there
i
can
bring
before
me
the
music
of
the
as
if
i
were
actually
hearing
it
and
the
scent
of
a
clematis
as
if
i
were
in
my
garden
and
the
flavour
of
a
peach
as
if
it
were
in
season
and
the
thought
i
have
of
all
these
is
as
of
something
individual
and
from
without
much
as
the
things
themselves
the
tune
the
scent
and
the
flavour
are
from
without
compared
with
the
things
themselves
these
images
as
they
may
be
called
are
faint
and
intermitting
nor
need
such
an
image
be
in
any
sense
an
abstraction
though
i
may
have
eaten
a
hundred
peaches
in
times
past
the
impression
which
remains
on
my
memory
of
the
flavour
may
be
of
any
of
them
of
the
ten
twenty
thirty
units
as
the
case
may
be
not
a
general
notion
distinct
from
every
one
of
them
and
formed
from
all
of
them
by
a
fabrication
of
my
mind
and
so
again
the
apprehension
which
we
have
of
our
past
mental
acts
of
any
kind
of
hope
inquiry
effort
triumph
disappointment
suspicion
hatred
and
a
hundred
others
is
an
apprehension
of
the
memory
of
those
definite
acts
and
therefore
an
apprehension
of
things
not
to
say
that
many
of
them
do
not
need
memory
but
are
such
as
admit
of
being
actually
summoned
and
repeated
at
our
will
such
an
apprehension
again
is
elicited
by
propositions
embodying
the
notices
of
our
history
of
our
pursuits
and
their
results
of
our
friends
of
our
bereavements
of
our
illnesses
of
our
fortunes
which
remain
imprinted
upon
our
memory
as
sharply
and
deeply
as
is
any
recollection
of
sight
nay
and
such
recollections
may
have
in
them
an
individuality
and
completeness
which
outlives
the
impressions
made
by
sensible
objects
the
memory
of
countenances
and
of
places
in
times
past
may
fade
away
from
the
mind
but
the
vivid
image
of
certain
anxieties
or
deliverances
never
and
by
means
of
these
particular
and
personal
experiences
thus
impressed
upon
us
we
attain
an
apprehension
of
what
such
things
are
at
other
times
when
we
have
not
experience
of
them
an
apprehension
of
sights
and
sounds
of
colours
and
forms
of
places
and
persons
of
mental
acts
and
states
parallel
to
our
actual
experiences
such
that
when
we
meet
with
definite
propositions
expressive
of
them
our
apprehension
can
not
be
called
abstract
and
notional
if
i
am
told
there
is
a
raging
fire
in
london
or
london
is
on
fire
fire
need
not
be
a
common
noun
in
my
apprehension
more
than
the
word
may
recall
to
my
memory
the
experience
of
a
fire
which
i
have
known
elsewhere
or
of
some
vivid
description
which
i
have
read
it
is
of
course
difficult
to
draw
the
line
and
to
say
where
the
office
of
memory
ends
and
where
abstraction
takes
its
place
and
again
as
i
said
in
my
first
pages
the
same
proposition
is
to
one
man
an
image
to
another
a
notion
but
still
there
is
a
host
of
predicates
of
the
most
various
kinds
lovely
vulgar
a
conceited
man
a
manufacturing
town
a
catastrophe
and
any
number
of
others
which
though
as
predicates
they
would
be
accounted
common
nouns
are
in
fact
in
the
mouths
of
particular
persons
singular
as
conveying
images
of
things
individual
as
the
rustic
in
virgil
says
urbem
quam
dicunt
romam
melibœe
putavi
stultus
ego
huic
nostræ
and
so
the
child
s
idea
of
a
king
as
derived
from
his
will
be
that
of
a
fierce
or
stern
or
venerable
man
seated
above
a
flight
of
steps
with
a
crown
on
his
head
and
a
sceptre
in
his
hand
in
these
two
instances
indeed
the
experience
does
but
mislead
when
applied
to
the
unknown
but
it
often
happens
on
the
contrary
that
it
is
a
serviceable
help
especially
when
a
man
has
large
experiences
and
has
learned
to
distinguish
between
them
and
apply
them
duly
as
in
the
instance
of
the
hero
who
knew
many
cities
of
men
and
many
further
we
are
able
by
an
inventive
faculty
or
as
i
may
call
it
the
faculty
of
composition
to
follow
the
descriptions
of
things
which
have
never
come
before
us
and
to
form
out
of
such
passive
impressions
as
experience
has
heretofore
left
on
our
minds
new
images
which
though
mental
creations
are
in
no
sense
abstractions
and
though
ideal
are
not
notional
they
are
concrete
units
in
the
minds
both
of
the
party
describing
and
the
party
informed
of
them
thus
i
may
never
have
seen
a
palm
or
a
banana
but
i
have
conversed
with
those
who
have
or
i
have
read
graphic
accounts
of
it
and
from
my
own
previous
knowledge
of
other
trees
have
been
able
with
so
ready
an
intelligence
to
interpret
their
language
and
to
light
up
such
an
image
of
it
in
my
thoughts
that
were
it
not
that
i
never
was
in
the
countries
where
the
tree
is
found
i
should
fancy
that
i
had
actually
seen
it
hence
again
it
is
the
very
praise
we
give
to
the
characters
of
some
great
poet
or
historian
that
he
is
so
individual
i
am
able
as
it
were
to
gaze
on
tiberius
as
tacitus
draws
him
and
to
figure
to
myself
our
james
the
first
as
he
is
painted
in
scott
s
romance
the
assassination
of
cæsar
his
et
tu
brute
his
collecting
his
robes
about
him
and
his
fall
under
pompey
s
statue
all
this
becomes
a
fact
to
me
and
an
object
of
real
apprehension
thus
it
is
that
we
live
in
the
past
and
in
the
distant
by
means
of
our
capacity
of
interpreting
the
statements
of
others
about
former
ages
or
foreign
climes
by
the
lights
of
our
own
experience
the
picture
which
historians
are
able
to
bring
before
us
of
cæsar
s
death
derives
its
vividness
and
effect
from
its
virtual
appeal
to
the
various
images
of
our
memory
this
faculty
of
composition
is
of
course
a
step
beyond
experience
but
we
have
now
reached
its
furthest
point
it
is
mainly
limited
as
regards
its
materials
by
the
sense
of
sight
as
regards
the
other
senses
new
images
can
not
well
be
elicited
and
shaped
out
of
old
experiences
no
description
however
complete
could
convey
to
my
mind
an
exact
likeness
of
a
tune
or
an
harmony
which
i
have
never
heard
and
still
less
of
a
scent
which
i
have
never
smelt
generic
resemblances
and
metaphorical
substitutes
are
indeed
producible
but
i
should
not
acquire
any
real
knowledge
of
the
scotch
air
there
s
nae
luck
by
being
told
it
was
like
auld
lang
syne
or
robin
gray
and
if
i
said
that
mozart
s
melodies
were
as
a
summer
sky
or
as
the
breath
of
zephyr
i
should
be
better
understood
by
those
who
knew
mozart
than
by
those
who
did
not
such
vague
illustrations
suggest
intellectual
notions
not
images
and
quite
as
difficult
is
it
to
create
or
to
apprehend
by
description
images
of
mental
facts
of
which
we
have
no
direct
experience
i
may
indeed
as
i
have
already
said
bring
home
to
my
mind
so
complex
a
fact
as
an
historical
character
by
composition
out
of
my
experiences
about
character
generally
tiberius
james
the
first
louis
the
eleventh
or
napoleon
but
who
is
able
to
infuse
into
me
or
how
shall
i
imbibe
a
sense
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
style
of
cicero
or
virgil
if
i
have
not
read
their
writings
or
how
shall
i
gain
a
shadow
of
a
perception
of
the
wit
or
the
grace
ascribed
to
the
conversation
of
the
french
salons
being
myself
an
untravelled
john
bull
and
so
again
as
regards
the
affections
and
passions
of
our
nature
they
are
respectively
and
incommensurable
and
must
be
severally
experienced
in
order
to
be
apprehended
really
i
can
understand
the
of
a
native
of
southern
europe
if
i
am
of
a
passionate
temper
myself
and
the
taste
for
speculation
or
betting
found
in
great
traders
or
on
the
turf
if
i
am
fond
of
enterprise
or
games
of
chance
but
on
the
other
hand
not
all
the
possible
descriptions
of
headlong
love
will
make
me
comprehend
the
if
i
have
never
had
a
fit
of
it
nor
will
ever
so
many
sermons
about
the
inward
satisfaction
of
strict
conscientiousness
create
in
my
mind
the
image
of
a
virtuous
action
and
its
attendant
sentiments
if
i
have
been
brought
up
to
lie
thieve
and
indulge
my
appetites
thus
we
meet
with
men
of
the
world
who
can
not
enter
into
the
very
idea
of
devotion
and
think
for
instance
that
from
the
nature
of
the
case
a
life
of
religious
seclusion
must
be
either
one
of
unutterable
dreariness
or
abandoned
sensuality
because
they
know
of
no
exercise
of
the
affections
but
what
is
merely
human
and
with
others
again
who
living
in
the
home
of
their
own
selfishness
ridicule
as
something
fanatical
and
pitiable
the
of
generous
and
chivalrous
honour
they
can
not
create
images
of
these
things
any
more
than
children
can
on
the
contrary
of
vice
when
they
ask
whereabouts
and
who
the
bad
men
are
for
they
have
no
personal
memories
and
have
to
content
themselves
with
notions
drawn
from
books
or
from
what
others
tell
them
so
much
on
the
apprehension
of
things
and
on
the
real
sense
in
our
use
of
language
now
let
us
pass
on
to
the
notional
sense
experience
tells
us
only
of
individual
things
and
these
things
are
innumerable
our
minds
might
have
been
so
constructed
as
to
be
able
to
receive
and
retain
an
exact
image
of
each
of
these
various
objects
one
by
one
as
it
came
before
us
but
only
in
and
for
itself
without
the
power
of
comparing
it
with
any
of
the
others
but
this
is
not
our
case
on
the
contrary
to
compare
and
to
contrast
are
among
the
most
prominent
and
busy
of
our
intellectual
functions
instinctively
even
though
unconsciously
we
are
ever
instituting
comparisons
between
the
manifold
phenomena
of
the
external
world
as
we
meet
with
them
criticizing
referring
to
a
standard
collecting
analyzing
them
nay
as
if
by
one
and
the
same
action
as
soon
as
we
perceive
them
we
also
perceive
that
they
are
like
each
other
or
unlike
or
rather
both
like
and
unlike
at
once
we
apprehend
spontaneously
even
before
we
set
about
apprehending
that
man
is
like
man
yet
unlike
and
unlike
a
horse
a
tree
a
mountain
or
a
monument
yet
in
some
though
not
the
same
respects
like
each
of
them
and
in
consequence
as
i
have
said
we
are
ever
grouping
and
discriminating
measuring
and
sounding
framing
cross
classes
and
cross
divisions
and
thereby
rising
from
particulars
to
generals
that
is
from
images
to
notions
in
processes
of
this
kind
we
regard
things
not
as
they
are
in
themselves
but
mainly
as
they
stand
in
relation
to
each
other
we
look
at
nothing
simply
for
its
own
sake
we
can
not
look
at
any
one
thing
without
keeping
our
eyes
on
a
multitude
of
other
things
besides
man
is
no
longer
what
he
really
is
an
individual
presented
to
us
by
our
senses
but
as
we
read
him
in
the
light
of
those
comparisons
and
contrasts
which
we
have
made
him
suggest
to
us
he
is
attenuated
into
an
aspect
or
relegated
to
his
place
in
a
classification
thus
his
appellation
is
made
to
suggest
not
the
real
being
which
he
is
in
this
or
that
specimen
of
himself
but
a
definition
if
i
might
use
a
harsh
metaphor
i
should
say
he
is
made
the
logarithm
of
his
true
self
and
in
that
shape
is
worked
with
the
ease
and
satisfaction
of
logarithms
it
is
plain
what
a
different
sense
language
will
bear
in
this
system
of
intellectual
notions
from
what
it
has
when
it
is
the
representative
of
things
and
such
a
use
of
it
is
not
only
the
very
foundation
of
all
science
but
may
be
and
is
carried
out
in
literature
and
in
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
man
with
man
and
then
it
comes
to
pass
that
individual
propositions
about
the
concrete
almost
cease
to
be
and
are
diluted
or
starved
into
abstract
notions
the
events
of
history
and
the
characters
who
figure
in
it
lose
their
individuality
states
and
governments
society
and
its
component
parts
cities
nations
even
the
physical
face
of
the
country
things
past
and
things
contemporary
all
that
fulness
of
meaning
which
i
have
described
as
accruing
to
language
from
experience
now
that
experience
is
absent
necessarily
becomes
to
the
multitude
of
men
nothing
but
a
heap
of
notions
little
more
intelligible
than
the
beauties
of
a
prospect
to
the
or
the
music
of
a
great
master
to
a
listener
who
has
no
ear
i
suppose
most
men
will
recollect
in
their
past
years
how
many
mistakes
they
have
made
about
persons
parties
local
occurrences
nations
and
the
like
of
which
at
the
time
they
had
no
actual
knowledge
of
their
own
how
ashamed
or
how
amused
they
have
since
been
at
their
own
gratuitous
idealism
when
they
came
into
possession
of
the
real
facts
concerning
them
they
were
accustomed
to
treat
the
definite
titus
or
sempronius
as
the
the
of
the
logician
they
spoke
of
his
opinions
his
motives
his
practices
as
their
traditional
rule
for
the
titus
or
sempronius
enjoined
in
order
to
find
out
what
individual
men
in
flesh
and
blood
were
they
fancied
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
refer
to
commonplaces
alphabetically
arranged
thus
they
were
well
up
with
the
character
of
a
whig
statesman
or
tory
magnate
a
wesleyan
a
congregationalist
a
parson
a
priest
a
philanthropist
a
writer
of
controversy
a
sceptic
and
found
themselves
prepared
without
the
trouble
of
direct
inquiry
to
draw
the
individual
after
the
peculiarities
of
his
type
and
so
with
national
character
the
late
duke
of
wellington
must
have

we

selfish

half

half

as
to
the
french
those
who
are

enough
to
recollect
the
wars
with
napoleon
know
what
eccentric
notions
were
popularly
entertained
about
them
in
england
how
it
was
even
a
surprise
to
find
some
military
man
who
was
a
prisoner
of
war
to
be
tall
and
stout
because
it
was
a
received
idea
that
all
frenchmen
were
undersized
and
lived
on
frogs
such
again
are
the
ideal
personages
who
figure
in
romances
and
dramas
of
the
old
school
tyrants
monks
crusaders
princes
in
disguise
and
captive
damsels
or
benevolent
or
angry
fathers
and
spendthrift
heirs
like
the
symbolical
characters
in
some
of
shakespeare
s
plays
a
tapster
or
a
lord
mayor
or
in
the
stage
directions
enter
two
what
i
have
been
illustrating
in
the
case
of
persons
might
be
instanced
in
regard
to
places
transactions
physical
calamities
events
in
history
words
which
are
used
by
an
to
express
things
unless
he
be
especially
eloquent
or
graphic
may
only
convey
general
notions
such
is
and
ever
must
be
the
popular
and
ordinary
mode
of
apprehending
language
on
few
subjects
only
have
any
of
us
the
opportunity
of
realizing
in
our
minds
what
we
speak
and
hear
about
and
we
fancy
that
we
are
doing
justice
to
individual
men
and
things
by
making
them
a
mere
of
qualities
as
if
any
number
whatever
of
abstractions
would
by
being
fused
together
be
equivalent
to
one
concrete
here
then
we
have
two
modes
of
thought
both
using
the
same
words
both
having
one
origin
yet
with
nothing
in
common
in
their
results
the
informations
of
sense
and
sensation
are
the
initial
basis
of
both
of
them
but
in
the
one
we
take
hold
of
objects
from
within
them
and
in
the
other
we
view
them
from
without
them
we
perpetuate
them
as
images
in
the
one
case
we
transform
them
into
notions
in
the
other
and
natural
to
us
as
are
both
processes
in
their
first
elements
and
in
their
growth
however
divergent
and
independent
in
their
direction
they
can
not
really
be
inconsistent
with
each
other
yet
no
one
from
the
sight
of
a
horse
or
a
dog
would
be
able
to
anticipate
its
zoological
definition
nor
from
a
knowledge
of
its
definition
to
draw
such
a
picture
as
would
direct
another
to
the
living
specimen
each
use
of
propositions
has
its
own
excellence
and
serviceableness
and
each
has
its
own
imperfection
to
apprehend
notionally
is
to
have
breadth
of
mind
but
to
be
shallow
to
apprehend
really
is
to
be
deep
but
to
be
the
latter
is
the
conservative
principle
of
knowledge
and
the
former
the
principle
of
its
advancement
without
the
apprehension
of
notions
we
should
for
ever
pace
round
one
small
circle
of
knowledge
without
a
firm
hold
upon
things
we
shall
waste
ourselves
in
vague
speculations
however
real
apprehension
has
the
precedence
as
being
the
scope
and
end
and
the
test
of
notional
and
the
fuller
is
the
mind
s
hold
upon
things
or
what
it
considers
such
the
more
fertile
is
it
in
its
aspects
of
them
and
the
more
practical
in
its
definitions
of
course
as
these
two
are
not
inconsistent
with
each
other
they
may
in
the
same
mind
indeed
there
is
no
one
who
does
not
to
a
certain
extent
exercise
both
the
one
and
the
other
viewed
in
relation
to
assent
which
has
led
to
my
speaking
of
them
they
do
not
in
any
way
affect
the
nature
of
the
mental
act
which
is
in
all
cases
absolute
and
unconditional
but
they
give
it
an
external
character
corresponding
respectively
to
their
own
so
much
so
that
at
first
sight
it
might
seem
as
if
assent
admitted
of
degrees
on
account
of
the
variation
of
vividness
in
these
different
apprehensions
as
notions
come
of
abstractions
so
images
come
of
experiences
the
more
fully
the
mind
is
occupied
by
an
experience
the
keener
will
be
its
assent
to
it
if
it
assents
and
on
the
other
hand
the
duller
will
be
its
assent
and
the
less
operative
the
more
it
is
engaged
with
an
abstraction
and
thus
a
scale
of
assents
is
conceivable
either
in
the
instance
of
one
mind
upon
different
subjects
or
of
many
minds
upon
one
subject
varying
from
an
assent
which
looks
like
mere
inference
up
to
a
belief
both
intense
and
practical
the
acceptance
which
we
accord
to
some
accidental
news
of
the
day
to
the
supernatural
dogmatic
faith
of
the
christian
it
follows
to
treat
of
assent
under
this
double
aspect
of
its
to
notions
and
assent
to
things
chapter
iv
notional
and
real
assent
i
have
said
that
our
apprehension
of
a
proposition
varies
in
strength
and
that
it
is
stronger
when
it
is
concerned
with
a
proposition
expressive
to
us
of
things
than
when
concerned
with
a
proposition
expressive
of
notions
and
i
have
given
this
reason
for
it
viz
that
what
is
concrete
exerts
a
force
and
makes
an
impression
on
the
mind
which
nothing
abstract
can
rival
that
is
i
have
argued
that
because
the
object
is
more
powerful
therefore
so
is
the
apprehension
of
it
i
do
not
think
it
unfair
reasoning
thus
to
take
the
apprehension
for
its
object
the
mind
is
ever
stimulated
in
proportion
to
the
cause
stimulating
it
sights
for
instance
sway
us
as
scents
do
not
whether
this
be
owing
to
a
greater
power
in
the
thing
seen
or
to
a
greater
receptivity
and
expansiveness
in
the
sense
of
seeing
is
a
superfluous
question
the
strong
object
would
make
the
apprehension
strong
our
sense
of
seeing
is
able
to
open
to
its
object
as
our
sense
of
smell
can
not
open
to
its
own
its
objects
are
able
to
awaken
the
mind
take
possession
of
it
inspire
it
act
through
it
with
an
energy
and
variousness
which
is
not
found
in
the
case
of
scents
and
their
apprehension
since
we
can
not
draw
the
line
between
the
object
and
the
act
i
am
at
liberty
to
say
as
i
have
said
that
as
is
the
thing
apprehended
so
is
the
apprehension
and
so
in
like
manner
as
regards
apprehension
of
mental
objects
if
an
image
derived
from
experience
or
information
is
stronger
than
an
abstraction
conception
or
i
am
more
arrested
by
our
lord
s
bearing
before
pilate
and
herod
than
by
the
justum
et
tenacem
of
the
poet
more
arrested
by
his
voice
saying
to
us
give
to
him
that
asketh
thee
than
by
the
best
arguments
of
the
economist
against
indiscriminate
almsgiving
it
does
not
matter
for
my
present
purpose
whether
the
objects
give
strength
to
the
apprehension
or
the
apprehension
gives
large
admittance
into
the
mind
to
the
object
it
is
in
human
nature
to
be
more
affected
by
the
concrete
than
by
the
abstract
it
may
be
the
reverse
with
other
beings
the
apprehension
then
may
be
as
fairly
said
to
possess
the
force
which
acts
upon
us
as
the
object
apprehended
real
apprehension
then
may
be
pronounced
stronger
than
notional
because
things
which
are
its
objects
are
confessedly
more
impressive
and
affective
than
notions
which
are
the
objects
of
notional
experiences
and
their
images
strike
and
occupy
the
mind
as
abstractions
and
their
combinations
do
not
next
passing
on
to
assent
i
observe
that
it
is
this
variation
in
the
mind
s
apprehension
of
an
object
to
which
it
assents
and
not
any
incompleteness
in
the
assent
itself
which
leads
us
to
speak
of
strong
and
weak
assents
as
if
assent
itself
admitted
of
degrees
in
either
mode
of
apprehension
be
it
real
or
be
it
notional
the
assent
preserves
its
essential
characteristic
of
being
unconditional
the
assent
of
a
stoic
to
the
justum
et
tenacem
may
be
as
genuine
an
assent
as
absolute
and
entire
as
little
admitting
of
degree
or
variation
as
distinct
from
an
act
of
inference
as
the
assent
of
a
christian
to
the
history
of
our
lord
s
passion
in
the
gospel
however
characteristic
as
it
is
of
assent
to
be
thus
in
its
nature
simply
one
and
indivisible
and
thereby
essentially
different
from
inference
which
is
ever
varying
in
strength
never
quite
at
the
same
pitch
in
any
two
of
its
acts
still
it
is
at
the
same
time
true
that
it
may
be
difficult
in
fact
by
external
tokens
to
distinguish
certain
acts
of
assent
from
certain
acts
of
inference
thus
whereas
no
one
could
possibly
confuse
the
real
assent
of
a
christian
to
the
fact
of
our
lord
s
crucifixion
with
the
notional
acceptance
of
it
as
a
point
of
history
on
the
part
of
a
philosophical
heathen
so
removed
from
each
other
are
the
respective
modes
of
apprehending
it
in
the
two
cases
though
in
both
the
assent
is
in
its
nature
one
and
the
same
nevertheless
it
would
be
easy
to
mistake
the
stoic
s
notional
assent
genuine
though
it
might
be
to
the
moral
nobleness
of
the
just
man
struggling
in
the
storms
of
fate
for
a
mere
act
of
inference
resulting
from
the
principles
of
his
stoical
profession
or
again
for
an
assent
merely
to
the
inferential
necessity
of
the
nobleness
of
that
struggle
nothing
indeed
is
more
common
than
to
praise
men
for
their
consistency
to
their
principles
whatever
those
principles
are
that
is
to
praise
them
on
an
inference
without
thereby
implying
any
assent
to
the
principles
themselves
the
cause
of
this
resemblance
between
acts
so
distinct
is
obvious
it
exists
only
in
cases
of
notional
assents
when
the
assent
is
given
to
notions
then
it
is
possible
to
hesitate
in
deciding
whether
it
is
assent
or
inference
whether
the
mind
is
merely
without
doubt
or
whether
it
is
actually
certain
and
the
reason
is
this
notional
assent
seems
like
inference
because
the
apprehension
which
accompanies
acts
of
inference
is
notional
also
inference
is
engaged
for
the
most
part
on
notional
propositions
both
premiss
and
conclusion
this
point
which
i
have
implied
throughout
i
here
distinctly
record
and
shall
enlarge
upon
hereafter
only
propositions
about
individuals
are
not
notional
and
they
are
seldom
the
matter
of
inference
thus
did
the
stoic
infer
the
fact
of
our
lord
s
death
instead
of
assenting
to
it
the
proposition
would
have
been
as
much
an
abstraction
to
him
as
the
justum
et
tenacem
c
nay
further
the
justus
et
tenax
was
at
least
a
notion
in
his
mind
but
jesus
christ
would
in
the
schools
of
athens
or
of
rome
have
stood
for
less
for
an
unknown
being
the
x
or
y
of
a
formula
except
then
in
some
of
the
cases
of
singular
conclusions
inferences
are
employed
on
notions
that
is
unless
they
are
employed
on
mere
symbols
and
indeed
when
they
are
symbolical
then
are
they
clearest
and
most
cogent
as
i
shall
hereafter
show
the
next
clearest
are
such
as
carry
out
the
necessary
results
of
previous
classifications
and
therefore
may
be
called
definitions
or
conclusions
as
we
please
for
instance
having
divided
beings
into
their
classes
the
definition
of
man
is
inevitable
we
may
call
it
then
the
normal
state
of
inference
to
apprehend
propositions
as
notions
we
may
call
it
the
normal
state
of
assent
to
apprehend
propositions
as
things
if
notional
apprehension
is
most
congenial
to
inference
real
apprehension
will
be
the
most
natural
concomitant
on
assent
an
act
of
inference
includes
in
its
object
the
dependence
of
its
thesis
upon
its
premisses
that
is
upon
a
relation
which
is
abstract
but
an
act
of
assent
rests
wholly
on
the
thesis
as
its
object
and
the
reality
of
the
thesis
is
almost
a
condition
of
its
unconditionality
i
am
led
on
to
make
one
remark
more
and
it
shall
be
my
last
an
act
of
assent
it
seems
is
the
most
perfect
and
highest
of
its
kind
when
it
is
exercised
on
propositions
which
are
apprehended
as
experiences
and
images
that
is
which
stand
for
things
and
on
the
other
hand
an
act
of
inference
is
the
most
perfect
and
highest
of
its
kind
when
it
is
exercised
on
propositions
which
are
apprehended
as
notions
that
is
which
are
creations
of
the
mind
an
act
of
inference
indeed
may
be
made
with
either
of
these
modes
of
apprehension
so
may
an
act
of
assent
but
when
inferences
are
exercised
on
things
they
tend
to
be
conjectures
or
presentiments
without
logical
force
and
when
assents
are
exercised
on
notions
they
tend
to
be
mere
assertions
without
any
personal
hold
on
them
on
the
part
of
those
who
make
them
if
this
be
so
the
paradox
is
true
that
when
inference
is
clearest
assent
may
be
least
forcible
and
when
assent
is
most
intense
inference
may
be
least
distinct
though
acts
of
assent
require
previous
acts
of
inference
they
require
them
not
as
adequate
causes
but
as
quâ
conditions
and
while
the
apprehension
strengthens
assent
inference
often
weakens
the
apprehension
notional
assents
i
shall
consider
assent
made
to
propositions
which
express
abstractions
or
notions
under
five
heads
which
i
shall
call
profession
credence
opinion
presumption
and
speculation
there
are
assents
so
feeble
and
superficial
as
to
be
little
more
than
assertions
i
class
them
all
together
under
the
head
of
profession
such
are
the
assents
made
upon
habit
and
without
reflection
as
when
a
man
calls
himself
a
tory
or
a
liberal
as
having
been
brought
up
as
such
or
again
when
he
adopts
as
a
matter
of
course
the
literary
or
other
fashions
of
the
day
admiring
the
poems
or
the
novels
or
the
music
or
the
personages
or
the
costume
or
the
wines
or
the
manners
which
happen
to
be
popular
or
are
patronized
in
the
higher
circles
such
again
are
the
assents
of
men
of
wavering
restless
minds
who
take
up
and
then
abandon
beliefs
so
readily
so
suddenly
as
to
make
it
appear
that
they
had
no
view
as
it
is
called
on
the
matter
they
professed
and
did
not
know
to
what
they
assented
or
why
then
again
when
men
say
they
have
no
doubt
of
a
thing
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
they
assent
to
it
infer
it
or
consider
it
highly
probable
there
are
many
cases
indeed
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
discriminate
between
assent
inference
and
assertion
on
account
of
the
otiose
passive
inchoate
character
of
the
act
in
question
if
i
say
that
will
be
fine
what
does
this
enunciation
mean
perhaps
it
means
that
it
ought
to
be
fine
if
the
glass
tells
truly
then
it
is
the
inference
of
a
probability
perhaps
it
means
no
more
than
a
surmise
because
it
is
fine
or
has
been
so
for
the
week
past
and
perhaps
it
is
a
compliance
with
the
word
of
another
in
which
case
it
is
sometimes
a
real
assent
sometimes
a
polite
assertion
or
a
wish
many
a
disciple
of
a
philosophical
school
who
talks
fluently
does
but
assert
when
he
seems
to
assent
to
the
of
his
master
little
as
he
may
be
aware
of
it
nor
is
he
secured
against
this
by
knowing
the
arguments
on
which
those
rest
for
he
may
learn
the
arguments
by
heart
as
a
careless
schoolboy
gets
up
his
euclid
this
practice
of
asserting
simply
on
authority
with
the
pretence
and
without
the
reality
of
assent
is
what
is
meant
by
formalism
to
say
i
do
not
understand
a
proposition
but
i
accept
it
on
authority
is
not
formalism
but
faith
it
is
not
a
direct
assent
to
the
proposition
still
it
an
assent
to
the
authority
which
enunciates
it
but
what
i
here
speak
of
is
professing
to
understand
without
understanding
it
is
thus
that
political
and
religious
watchwords
are
created
first
one
man
of
name
and
then
another
adopts
them
till
their
use
becomes
popular
and
then
every
one
professes
them
because
every
one
else
does
such
words
are
liberality
progress
light
civilization
such
are
justification
by
faith
only
vital
religion
private
judgment
the
bible
and
nothing
but
the
such
again
are
rationalism
gallicanism
jesuitism
ultramontanism
of
which
in
the
mouths
of
conscientious
thinkers
have
a
definite
meaning
but
are
used
by
the
multitude
as
nicknames
and
shibboleths
with
scarcely
enough
of
the
scantiest
grammatical
apprehension
of
them
to
allow
of
their
being
considered
really
more
than
assertions
thus
instances
occur
now
and
then
when
in
consequence
of
the
urgency
of
some
fashionable
superstition
or
popular
delusion
some
eminent
scientific
authority
is
provoked
to
come
forward
and
to
set
the
world
right
by
his
ipse
he
indeed
himself
knows
very
well
what
he
is
about
he
has
a
right
to
speak
and
his
reasonings
and
conclusions
are
sufficient
not
only
for
his
own
but
for
general
assent
and
it
may
be
are
as
simply
true
and
impregnable
as
they
are
authoritative
but
an
intelligent
hold
on
the
matter
in
dispute
such
as
he
has
himself
can
not
be
expected
in
the
case
of
men
in
general
they
nevertheless
one
and
all
repeat
and
retail
his
arguments
as
suddenly
as
if
they
had
not
to
study
them
as
heartily
as
if
they
understood
them
changing
round
and
becoming
as
strong
antagonists
of
the
error
which
their
master
has
exposed
as
if
they
had
never
been
its
advocates
if
their
word
is
to
be
taken
it
is
not
simply
his
authority
that
moves
them
which
would
be
sensible
enough
and
suitable
in
them
both
apprehension
and
assent
being
in
that
case
grounded
on
the
maxim
cuique
in
arte
suâ
credendum
but
so
far
forth
as
they
disown
this
motive
and
claim
to
judge
in
a
scientific
question
of
the
worth
of
arguments
which
require
some
real
knowledge
they
are
little
better
not
of
course
in
a
very
serious
matter
than
pretenders
and
formalists
not
only
authority
but
inference
also
may
impose
on
us
assents
which
in
themselves
are
little
better
than
assertions
and
which
so
far
as
they
are
assents
can
only
be
notional
assents
as
being
assents
not
to
the
propositions
inferred
but
to
the
truth
of
those
propositions
for
instance
it
can
be
proved
by
irrefragable
calculations
that
the
stars
are
not
less
than
billions
of
miles
distant
from
the
earth
and
the
process
of
calculation
upon
which
such
statements
are
made
is
not
so
difficult
as
to
require
authority
to
secure
our
acceptance
of
both
it
and
of
them
yet
who
can
say
that
he
has
any
real
nay
any
notional
apprehension
of
a
billion
or
a
trillion
we
can
indeed
have
some
notion
of
it
if
we
analyze
it
into
its
factors
if
we
compare
it
with
other
numbers
or
if
we
illustrate
it
by
analogies
or
by
its
implications
but
i
am
speaking
of
the
vast
number
in
itself
we
can
not
assent
to
a
proposition
of
which
it
is
the
predicate
we
can
but
assent
to
the
truth
of
it
this
leads
me
to
the
question
whether
belief
in
a
mystery
can
be
more
than
an
assertion
i
consider
it
can
be
an
assent
and
my
reasons
for
saying
so
are
as
follows
mystery
is
a
proposition
conveying
incompatible
notions
or
is
a
statement
of
the
inconceivable
now
we
can
assent
to
propositions
and
a
mystery
is
a
proposition
provided
we
can
apprehend
them
therefore
we
can
assent
to
a
mystery
for
unless
we
in
some
sense
apprehended
it
we
should
not
recognize
it
to
be
a
mystery
that
is
a
statement
uniting
incompatible
notions
the
same
act
then
which
enables
us
to
discern
that
the
words
of
the
proposition
express
a
mystery
capacitates
us
for
assenting
to
it
words
which
make
nonsense
do
not
make
a
mystery
no
one
would
call
warton
s
revolving
swans
proclaim
the
welkin
near
inconceivable
assertion
it
is
equally
plain
that
the
assent
which
we
give
to
mysteries
as
such
is
notional
assent
for
by
the
supposition
it
is
assent
to
propositions
which
we
can
not
conceive
whereas
if
we
had
had
experience
of
them
we
should
be
able
to
conceive
them
and
without
experience
assent
is
not
real
but
the
question
follows
can
processes
of
inference
end
in
a
mystery
that
is
not
only
in
what
is
incomprehensible
that
the
stars
are
billions
of
miles
from
each
other
but
in
what
is
inconceivable
in
the
of
seeming
incompatibilities
for
how
it
may
be
asked
can
reason
carry
out
notions
into
their
contradictories
since
all
the
developments
of
a
truth
must
from
the
nature
of
the
case
be
consistent
both
with
it
and
with
each
other
i
answer
certainly
processes
of
inference
however
accurate
can
end
in
mystery
and
i
solve
the
objection
to
such
a
doctrine
thus
notion
of
a
thing
may
be
only
partially
faithful
to
the
original
it
may
be
in
excess
of
the
thing
or
it
may
represent
it
incompletely
and
in
consequence
it
may
serve
for
it
it
may
stand
for
it
only
to
a
certain
point
in
certain
cases
but
no
further
after
that
point
is
reached
the
notion
and
the
thing
part
company
and
then
the
notion
if
still
used
as
the
representative
of
the
thing
will
work
out
conclusions
not
inconsistent
with
itself
but
with
the
thing
to
which
it
no
longer
corresponds
this
is
seen
most
familiarly
in
the
use
of
metaphors
thus
in
an
oxford
satire
which
deservedly
made
a
sensation
in
its
day
it
is
said
that
vice
from
its
hardness
takes
a
polish
whence
we
might
argue
that
whereas
caliban
was
vicious
he
was
therefore
polished
but
politeness
and
caliban
are
incompatible
notions
or
again
when
some
one
said
perhaps
to
johnson
that
a
certain
writer
say
hume
was
a
clear
thinker
he
made
answer
all
shallows
are
but
supposing
hume
to
be
in
fact
both
a
clear
and
a
deep
thinker
yet
supposing
clearness
and
depth
are
incompatible
in
their
literal
sense
which
the
objection
seems
to
imply
and
still
in
their
full
literal
sense
were
to
be
ascribed
to
hume
then
our
reasoning
about
his
intellect
has
ended
in
the
mystery
deep
hume
is
shallow
whereas
the
contradiction
lies
not
in
the
reasoning
but
in
the
fancying
that
inadequate
notions
can
be
taken
as
the
exact
representations
of
things
hence
in
science
we
sometimes
use
a
definition
or
a
not
as
exact
but
as
being
sufficient
for
our
purpose
for
working
out
certain
conclusions
for
a
practical
approximation
the
error
being
small
till
a
certain
point
is
reached
this
is
what
in
theological
investigations
i
should
call
an
economy
a
like
contrast
between
notions
and
the
things
which
they
represent
is
the
principle
of
suspense
and
curiosity
in
those
enigmatical
sayings
which
were
frequent
in
the
early
stage
of
human
society
in
them
the
problem
proposed
to
the
acuteness
of
the
hearers
is
to
find
some
real
thing
which
may
unite
in
itself
certain
conflicting
notions
which
in
the
question
are
attributed
to
it
out
of
the
eater
came
forth
meat
and
out
of
the
strong
came
forth
sweetness
or
what
creature
is
that
which
in
the
morning
goes
on
four
legs
at
noon
on
two
and
on
three
in
the
evening
the
answer
which
names
the
thing
interprets
and
thereby
limits
the
notions
under
which
it
has
been
represented
let
us
take
an
example
in
algebra
its
calculus
is
commonly
used
to
investigate
not
only
the
relations
of
quantity
generally
but
geometrical
facts
in
particular
now
it
is
at
once
too
wide
and
too
narrow
for
such
a
purpose
fitting
on
to
the
doctrine
of
lines
and
angles
with
a
bad
fit
as
the
coat
of
a
short
and
stout
man
might
serve
the
needs
of
one
who
was
tall
and
slim
certainly
it
works
well
for
geometrical
purposes
up
to
a
certain
point
as
when
it
enables
us
to
dispense
with
the
cumbrous
method
of
proof
in
questions
of
ratio
and
proportion
which
is
adopted
in
the
fifth
book
of
euclid
but
what
are
we
to
make
of
the
fourth
power
of
when
it
is
to
be
translated
into
geometrical
language
if
from
this
algebraical
expression
we
determined
that
space
admitted
of
four
dimensions
we
should
be
enunciating
a
mystery
because
we
should
be
applying
to
space
a
notion
which
belongs
to
quantity
in
this
case
algebra
is
in
excess
of
geometrical
truth
now
let
us
take
an
instance
in
which
it
falls
short
of
geometry
is
the
meaning
of
the
square
root
of
here
the
mystery
is
on
the
side
of
algebra
and
in
accordance
with
the
principle
which
i
am
illustrating
it
has
sometimes
been
considered
as
an
abortive
effort
to
express
what
is
really
beyond
the
capacity
of
algebraical
notation
the
direction
and
position
of
lines
in
the
third
dimension
of
space
as
well
as
their
length
upon
a
plane
when
the
calculus
is
urged
on
by
the
inevitable
course
of
the
working
to
do
what
it
can
not
do
it
stops
short
as
if
in
resistance
and
protests
by
an
absurdity
our
notions
of
things
are
never
simply
commensurate
with
the
things
themselves
they
are
aspects
of
them
more
or
less
exact
and
sometimes
a
mistake
take
an
instance
from
arithmetic
are
accustomed
to
subject
all
that
exists
to
numeration
but
to
be
correct
we
are
bound
first
to
reduce
to
some
level
of
possible
comparison
the
things
which
we
wish
to
number
we
must
be
able
to
say
not
only
that
they
are
ten
twenty
or
a
hundred
but
so
many
definite
somethings
for
instance
we
could
not
without
extravagance
throw
together
napoleon
s
brain
ambition
hand
soul
smile
height
and
age
at
marengo
and
say
that
there
were
seven
of
them
though
there
are
seven
words
nor
will
it
even
be
enough
to
content
ourselves
with
what
may
be
called
a
negative
level
viz
that
these
seven
were
an
or
are
a
departed
seven
unless
numeration
is
to
issue
in
nonsense
it
must
be
conducted
on
conditions
this
being
the
case
there
are
for
what
we
know
collections
of
beings
to
whom
the
notion
of
number
can
not
be
attached
except
because
taken
individually
no
positive
point
of
real
agreement
can
be
found
between
them
by
which
to
call
them
if
indeed
we
can
denote
them
by
a
plural
noun
then
we
can
measure
that
plurality
but
if
they
agree
in
nothing
they
can
not
agree
in
bearing
a
common
name
and
to
say
that
they
amount
to
a
thousand
these
or
those
is
not
to
number
them
but
to
count
up
a
certain
number
of
names
or
words
which
we
have
written
down
thus
the
angels
have
been
considered
by
divines
to
have
each
of
them
a
species
to
himself
and
we
may
fancy
each
of
them
so
absolutely
as
to
be
like
nothing
else
so
that
it
would
be
as
untrue
to
speak
of
a
thousand
angels
as
of
a
thousand
hannibals
or
ciceros
it
will
be
said
indeed
that
all
beings
but
one
at
least
will
come
under
the
notion
of
creatures
and
are
dependent
upon
that
one
but
that
is
true
of
the
brain
smile
and
height
of
napoleon
which
no
one
would
call
three
creatures
but
if
all
this
be
so
much
more
does
it
apply
to
our
speculations
concerning
the
supreme
being
whom
it
may
be
unmeaning
not
only
to
number
with
other
beings
but
to
subject
to
number
in
regard
to
his
own
intrinsic
characteristics
that
is
to
apply
arithmetical
notions
to
him
may
be
as
unphilosophical
as
it
is
profane
though
he
is
at
once
father
son
and
holy
ghost
the
word
trinity
belongs
to
those
notions
of
him
which
are
forced
on
us
by
the
necessity
of
our
finite
conceptions
the
real
and
immutable
distinction
which
exists
between
person
and
person
implying
in
itself
no
infringement
of
his
real
and
numerical
unity
and
if
it
be
asked
how
if
we
can
not
properly
speak
of
him
as
three
we
can
speak
of
him
as
one
i
reply
that
he
is
not
one
in
the
way
in
which
created
things
are
severally
units
for
one
as
applied
to
ourselves
is
used
in
contrast
to
two
or
three
and
a
whole
series
of
numbers
but
of
the
supreme
being
it
is
safer
to
use
the
word
monad
than
unit
for
he
has
not
even
such
relation
to
his
creatures
as
to
allow
philosophically
speaking
of
our
contrasting
him
with
them
coming
back
to
the
main
subject
which
i
have
illustrated
at
the
risk
of
digression
i
observe
that
an
alleged
fact
is
not
therefore
impossible
because
it
is
inconceivable
for
the
incompatible
notions
in
which
consists
its
inconceivableness
need
not
each
of
them
really
belong
to
it
in
that
fulness
which
involves
their
being
incompatible
with
each
other
it
is
true
indeed
that
i
deny
the
possibility
of
two
straight
lines
enclosing
a
space
on
the
ground
of
its
being
inconceivable
but
i
do
so
because
a
straight
line
is
a
notion
and
nothing
more
and
not
a
thing
to
which
i
may
have
attached
a
notion
more
or
less
unfaithful
i
have
defined
a
straight
line
in
my
own
way
at
my
own
pleasure
the
question
is
not
one
of
facts
at
all
but
of
the
consistency
with
each
other
of
definitions
and
of
their
logical
consequences
space
is
not
infinite
for
nothing
but
the
creator
is
such
from
this
thesis
as
a
theological
information
to
be
assumed
as
a
fact
though
not
one
of
experience
we
arrive
at
once
at
an
insoluble
mystery
for
if
space
be
not
infinite
it
is
finite
and
finite
space
is
a
contradiction
in
notions
space
as
such
implying
the
absence
of
boundaries
here
again
it
is
our
notion
that
carries
us
beyond
the
fact
and
in
opposition
to
it
showing
that
from
the
first
what
we
apprehend
of
space
does
not
in
all
respects
correspond
to
the
thing
of
which
indeed
we
have
no
image
this
then
is
another
instance
in
which
the
juxtaposition
of
notions
by
the
logical
faculty
lands
us
in
what
are
commonly
called
mysteries
notions
are
but
aspects
of
things
the
free
deductions
from
one
of
these
necessarily
contradicts
the
free
deductions
from
another
after
proceeding
in
our
investigations
a
certain
way
suddenly
a
blank
or
a
maze
presents
itself
before
the
mental
vision
as
when
the
eye
is
confused
by
the
varying
slides
of
a
telescope
thus
we
believe
in
the
infinitude
of
the
divine
attributes
but
we
can
have
no
experience
of
infinitude
as
a
fact
the
word
stands
for
a
definition
or
a
notion
hence
when
we
try
how
to
reconcile
in
the
moral
world
the
fulness
of
mercy
with
exactitude
in
sanctity
and
justice
or
to
explain
that
the
physical
tokens
of
creative
skill
need
not
suggest
any
want
of
creative
power
we
feel
we
are
not
masters
of
our
subject
we
apprehend
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
assent
to
these
theological
truths
as
mysteries
did
we
not
apprehend
them
at
all
we
should
be
merely
asserting
though
even
then
we
might
convert
that
assertion
into
an
assent
if
we
wished
to
do
so
as
i
have
already
shown
by
making
it
the
subject
of
a
proposition
and
predicating
of
it
that
it
is
true
what
i
mean
by
giving
credence
to
propositions
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
having
no
doubt
about
them
it
is
the
sort
of
assent
which
we
give
to
those
opinions
and
professed
facts
which
are
ever
presenting
themselves
to
us
without
any
effort
of
ours
and
which
we
commonly
take
for
granted
thereby
obtaining
a
broad
foundation
of
thought
for
ourselves
and
a
medium
of
intercourse
between
ourselves
and
others
this
form
of
notional
assent
comprises
a
great
variety
of
and
is
as
i
have
implied
of
an
otiose
and
passive
character
accepting
whatever
comes
to
hand
from
whatever
quarter
warranted
or
not
so
that
it
convey
nothing
on
the
face
of
it
to
its
own
disadvantage
from
the
time
that
we
begin
to
observe
think
and
reason
to
the
final
failure
of
our
powers
we
are
ever
acquiring
fresh
and
fresh
informations
by
means
of
our
senses
and
still
more
from
others
and
from
books
the
friends
or
strangers
whom
we
fall
in
with
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
conversations
or
discussions
to
which
we
are
parties
the
newspapers
the
light
reading
of
the
season
our
recreations
our
rambles
in
the
country
our
foreign
tours
all
pour
their
contributions
of
intellectual
matter
into
the
storehouses
of
our
memory
and
though
much
may
be
lost
much
is
retained
these
informations
thus
received
with
a
spontaneous
assent
constitute
the
furniture
of
the
mind
and
make
the
difference
between
its
civilized
condition
and
a
state
of
nature
they
are
its
education
as
far
as
general
knowledge
can
so
be
called
and
though
education
is
discipline
as
well
as
learning
still
unless
the
mind
implicitly
welcomes
the
truths
real
or
ostensible
which
these
informations
supply
it
will
gain
neither
formation
nor
a
stimulus
for
its
activity
and
progress
besides
to
believe
frankly
what
it
is
told
is
in
the
young
an
exercise
of
teachableness
and
humility
credence
is
the
means
by
which
in
high
and
low
in
the
man
of
the
world
and
in
the
recluse
our
bare
and
barren
nature
is
overrun
and
diversified
from
without
with
a
rich
and
living
clothing
it
is
by
such
ungrudging
prompt
assents
to
what
is
offered
to
us
so
lavishly
that
we
become
possessed
of
the
principles
doctrines
sentiments
facts
which
constitute
useful
and
especially
liberal
knowledge
these
various
teachings
shallow
though
they
be
are
of
a
breadth
which
secures
us
against
those
of
knowledge
which
are
apt
to
befall
the
professed
student
and
keep
us
up
to
the
mark
in
literature
in
the
arts
in
history
and
in
public
matters
they
give
us
in
great
measure
our
morality
our
politics
our
social
code
our
art
of
life
they
supply
the
elements
of
public
opinion
the
watchwords
of
patriotism
the
standards
of
thought
and
action
they
are
our
mutual
understandings
our
channels
of
sympathy
our
means
of
and
the
bond
of
our
civil
union
they
become
our
moral
language
we
learn
them
as
we
learn
our
mother
tongue
they
distinguish
us
from
foreigners
they
are
in
each
of
us
not
indeed
personal
but
national
characteristics
this
account
of
them
implies
that
they
are
received
with
a
notional
not
a
real
assent
they
are
too
manifold
to
be
received
in
any
other
way
even
the
most
practised
and
earnest
minds
must
needs
be
superficial
in
the
greater
part
of
their
attainments
they
know
just
enough
on
all
subjects
in
literature
history
politics
philosophy
and
art
to
be
able
to
converse
sensibly
on
them
and
to
understand
those
who
are
really
deep
in
one
or
other
of
them
this
is
what
is
called
with
a
special
appositeness
a
gentleman
s
knowledge
as
contrasted
with
that
of
a
professional
man
and
is
neither
worthless
nor
despicable
if
used
for
its
proper
ends
but
it
is
never
more
than
the
furniture
of
the
mind
as
i
have
called
it
it
never
is
thoroughly
assimilated
with
it
yet
of
course
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
those
who
have
even
the
largest
stock
of
such
notions
from
devoting
themselves
to
one
or
other
of
the
subjects
to
which
those
notions
belong
and
mastering
it
with
a
real
apprehension
and
then
their
general
knowledge
of
all
subjects
may
be
made
variously
useful
in
the
direction
of
that
particular
study
or
pursuit
which
they
have
selected
i
have
been
speaking
of
secular
knowledge
but
religion
may
be
made
a
subject
of
notional
assent
also
and
is
especially
so
made
in
our
own
country
theology
as
such
always
is
notional
as
being
scientific
religion
as
being
personal
should
be
real
but
except
within
a
small
range
of
subjects
it
commonly
is
not
real
in
england
as
to
catholic
populations
such
as
those
of
medieval
europe
or
the
spain
of
this
day
or
as
those
of
russia
among
them
assent
to
religious
objects
is
real
not
notional
to
them
the
supreme
being
our
lord
the
blessed
virgin
angels
and
saints
heaven
and
hell
are
as
present
as
if
they
were
objects
of
sight
but
such
a
faith
does
not
suit
the
genius
of
modern
england
there
is
in
the
literary
world
just
now
an
affectation
of
calling
religion
a
sentiment
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
usually
it
is
nothing
more
with
our
own
people
educated
or
rude
objects
are
barely
necessary
to
it
i
do
not
say
so
of
old
calvinism
or
evangelical
religion
i
do
not
call
the
religion
of
leighton
beveridge
wesley
thomas
scott
or
cecil
a
mere
sentiment
nor
do
i
so
term
the
high
anglicanism
of
the
present
generation
but
these
are
only
denominations
parties
schools
compared
with
the
national
religion
of
england
in
its
length
and
breadth
bible
religion
is
both
the
recognized
title
and
the
best
description
of
english
religion
it
consists
not
in
rites
or
creeds
but
mainly
in
having
the
bible
read
in
church
in
the
family
and
in
private
now
i
am
far
indeed
from
undervaluing
that
mere
knowledge
of
scripture
which
is
imparted
to
the
population
thus
promiscuously
at
least
in
england
it
has
to
a
certain
point
made
up
for
great
and
grievous
losses
in
its
christianity
the
reiteration
again
and
again
in
fixed
course
in
the
public
service
of
the
words
of
inspired
teachers
under
both
covenants
and
that
in
grave
majestic
english
has
in
matter
of
fact
been
to
our
people
a
vast
benefit
it
has
attuned
their
minds
to
religious
thoughts
it
has
given
them
a
high
moral
standard
it
has
served
them
in
associating
religion
with
compositions
which
even
humanly
considered
are
among
the
most
sublime
and
beautiful
ever
written
especially
it
has
impressed
upon
them
the
series
of
divine
providences
in
behalf
of
man
from
his
creation
to
his
end
and
above
all
the
words
deeds
and
sacred
sufferings
of
him
in
whom
all
the
providences
of
god
centre
so
far
the
indiscriminate
reading
of
scripture
has
been
of
service
still
much
more
is
necessary
than
the
benefits
which
i
have
enumerated
to
answer
to
the
idea
of
a
religion
whereas
our
national
form
professes
to
be
little
more
than
thus
reading
the
bible
and
living
a
correct
life
it
is
not
a
religion
of
persons
and
things
of
acts
of
faith
and
of
direct
devotion
but
of
sacred
scenes
and
pious
sentiments
it
has
been
comparatively
careless
of
creed
and
catechism
and
has
in
consequence
shown
little
sense
of
the
need
of
consistency
in
the
matter
of
its
teaching
its
doctrines
are
not
so
much
facts
as
stereotyped
aspects
of
facts
and
it
is
afraid
so
to
say
of
walking
round
them
it
induces
its
followers
to
be
content
with
this
meagre
view
of
revealed
truth
or
rather
it
is
suspicious
and
protests
or
is
frightened
as
if
it
saw
a
figure
in
a
picture
move
out
of
its
frame
when
our
lord
the
blessed
virgin
or
the
holy
apostles
are
spoken
of
as
real
beings
and
really
such
as
scripture
implies
them
to
be
i
am
not
denying
that
the
assent
which
it
inculcates
and
elicits
is
genuine
as
regards
its
contracted
range
of
doctrine
but
it
is
at
best
notional
what
scripture
especially
illustrates
from
its
first
page
to
its
last
is
god
s
providence
and
that
is
nearly
the
only
doctrine
held
with
a
real
assent
by
the
mass
of
religious
englishmen
hence
the
bible
is
so
great
a
solace
and
refuge
to
them
in
trouble
i
repeat
i
am
not
speaking
of
particular
schools
and
parties
in
england
whether
of
the
high
church
or
the
low
but
of
the
mass
of
and
people
in
all
ranks
of
the
community
that
class
of
assents
which
i
have
called
credence
being
a
spontaneous
acceptance
of
the
various
informations
which
are
by
whatever
means
conveyed
to
our
minds
sometimes
goes
by
the
name
of
opinion
when
we
speak
of
a
man
s
opinions
what
do
we
mean
but
the
collection
of
notions
which
he
happens
to
have
and
does
not
easily
part
with
though
he
has
neither
sufficient
proof
nor
firm
grasp
of
them
this
is
true
however
opinion
is
a
word
of
various
significations
and
i
prefer
to
use
it
in
my
own
besides
standing
for
credence
it
is
sometimes
taken
to
mean
conviction
as
when
we
speak
of
the
variety
of
religious
opinions
or
of
being
persecuted
for
religious
opinions
or
of
our
having
no
opinion
on
a
particular
point
or
of
another
having
no
religious
and
sometimes
it
is
used
in
contrast
with
conviction
as
synonymous
with
a
light
and
casual
though
genuine
assent
thus
if
a
man
was
every
day
changing
his
mind
that
is
his
assents
we
might
say
that
he
was
very
changeable
in
his
opinions
i
shall
here
use
the
word
to
denote
an
assent
but
an
assent
to
a
proposition
not
as
true
but
as
probably
true
that
is
to
the
probability
of
that
which
the
proposition
enunciates
and
as
that
probability
may
vary
in
strength
without
limit
so
may
the
cogency
and
moment
of
the
opinion
this
account
of
opinion
may
seem
to
confuse
it
with
inference
for
the
strength
of
an
inference
varies
with
its
premisses
and
is
a
probability
but
the
two
acts
of
mind
are
really
distinct
opinion
as
being
an
assent
is
independent
of
premisses
we
have
opinions
which
we
never
think
of
defending
by
argument
though
of
course
we
think
they
can
be
so
defended
we
are
even
obstinate
in
them
or
what
is
called
opinionated
and
may
say
that
we
have
a
right
to
think
just
as
we
please
reason
or
no
reason
whereas
inference
is
in
its
nature
and
by
its
profession
conditional
and
uncertain
to
say
that
we
shall
have
a
fine
if
the
present
weather
lasts
does
not
come
of
the
same
state
of
mind
as
i
am
of
opinion
that
we
shall
have
a
fine
this
opinion
thus
explained
has
more
connexion
with
credence
than
with
inference
it
differs
from
credence
in
these
two
points
viz
that
while
opinion
explicitly
assents
to
the
probability
of
a
given
proposition
credence
is
an
implicit
assent
to
its
truth
it
differs
from
credence
in
a
third
respect
viz
in
being
a
reflex
act
we
take
a
thing
for
granted
we
have
credence
in
it
when
we
begin
to
reflect
upon
our
credence
and
to
measure
estimate
and
modify
it
then
we
are
forming
an
opinion
it
is
in
this
sense
that
catholics
speak
of
theological
opinion
in
contrast
with
faith
in
dogma
it
is
much
more
than
an
inferential
act
but
it
is
distinct
from
an
act
of
certitude
and
this
is
really
the
sense
which
protestants
give
to
the
word
when
they
interpret
it
by
conviction
for
their
highest
opinion
in
religion
is
generally
speaking
an
assent
to
a
even
butler
has
been
understood
or
misunderstood
to
teach
therefore
consistent
with
toleration
of
its
contradictory
opinion
being
such
as
i
have
described
is
a
notional
assent
for
the
predicate
of
the
proposition
on
which
it
is
exercised
is
the
abstract
word
by
presumption
i
mean
an
assent
to
first
principles
and
by
first
principles
i
mean
the
propositions
with
which
we
start
in
reasoning
on
any
given
they
are
in
consequence
very
numerous
and
vary
in
great
measure
with
the
persons
who
reason
according
to
their
judgment
and
power
of
assent
being
received
by
some
minds
not
by
others
and
only
a
few
of
them
received
universally
they
are
all
of
them
notions
not
images
because
they
express
what
is
abstract
not
what
is
individual
and
from
direct
experience
sometimes
our
trust
in
our
powers
of
reasoning
and
memory
that
is
our
implicit
assent
to
their
telling
truly
is
treated
as
a
first
principle
but
we
can
not
properly
be
said
to
have
any
trust
in
them
as
faculties
at
most
we
trust
in
particular
acts
of
memory
and
reasoning
we
are
sure
there
was
a
yesterday
and
that
we
did
this
or
that
in
it
we
are
sure
that
three
times
six
is
eighteen
and
that
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
longer
than
the
side
so
far
as
this
we
may
be
said
to
trust
the
mental
act
by
which
the
object
of
our
assent
is
verified
but
in
doing
so
we
imply
no
recognition
of
a
general
power
or
faculty
or
of
any
capability
or
affection
of
our
minds
over
and
above
the
particular
act
we
know
indeed
that
we
have
a
faculty
by
which
we
remember
as
we
know
we
have
a
faculty
by
which
we
breathe
but
we
gain
this
knowledge
by
abstraction
or
inference
from
its
particular
acts
not
by
direct
experience
nor
do
we
trust
in
the
faculty
of
memory
or
reasoning
as
such
even
after
that
we
have
inferred
its
existence
for
its
acts
are
often
inaccurate
nor
do
we
invariably
assent
to
them
however
if
i
must
speak
my
mind
i
have
another
ground
for
reluctance
to
speak
of
our
trusting
memory
or
reasoning
except
indeed
by
a
figure
of
speech
it
seems
to
me
unphilosophical
to
speak
of
trusting
ourselves
we
are
what
we
are
and
we
use
not
trust
our
faculties
to
debate
about
trusting
in
a
case
like
this
is
parallel
to
the
confusion
implied
in
wishing
i
had
had
a
choice
if
i
would
be
created
or
no
or
speculating
what
i
should
be
like
if
i
were
born
of
other
parents
proximus
sum
egomet
our
consciousness
of
self
is
prior
to
all
questions
of
trust
or
assent
we
act
according
to
our
nature
by
means
of
ourselves
when
we
remember
or
reason
we
are
as
little
able
to
accept
or
reject
our
mental
constitution
as
our
being
we
have
not
the
option
we
can
but
misuse
or
mar
its
functions
we
do
not
confront
or
bargain
with
ourselves
and
therefore
i
can
not
call
the
trustworthiness
of
the
faculties
of
memory
and
reasoning
one
of
our
first
principles
next
as
to
the
proposition
that
things
exist
external
to
ourselves
this
i
do
consider
a
first
principle
and
one
of
universal
reception
it
is
founded
on
an
instinct
i
so
call
it
because
the
brute
creation
possesses
it
this
instinct
is
directed
towards
individual
phenomena
one
by
one
and
has
nothing
of
the
character
of
a
generalization
and
since
it
exists
in
brutes
the
gift
of
reason
is
not
a
condition
of
its
existence
and
it
may
justly
be
considered
an
instinct
in
man
what
the
human
mind
does
is
what
brutes
can
not
do
viz
to
draw
from
our
experiences
of
its
testimony
in
particulars
a
general
proposition
and
because
this
instinct
or
intuition
acts
whenever
the
phenomena
of
sense
present
themselves
to
lay
down
in
broad
terms
by
an
inductive
process
the
great
aphorism
that
there
is
an
external
world
and
that
all
the
phenomena
of
sense
proceed
from
it
this
general
proposition
to
which
we
go
on
to
assent
goes
though
not
far
beyond
our
experience
illimitable
as
that
experience
may
be
and
represents
a
notion
i
have
spoken
and
i
think
rightly
spoken
of
instinct
as
a
force
which
spontaneously
impels
us
not
only
to
bodily
movements
but
to
mental
acts
it
is
instinct
which
leads
the
principle
whatever
it
is
in
brutes
to
perceive
in
the
phenomena
of
sense
a
something
distinct
from
and
beyond
those
phenomena
it
is
instinct
which
impels
the
child
to
recognize
in
the
smiles
or
the
frowns
of
a
countenance
which
meets
his
eyes
not
only
a
being
external
to
himself
but
one
whose
looks
elicit
in
him
confidence
or
fear
and
as
he
instinctively
interprets
these
physical
phenomena
as
tokens
of
things
beyond
themselves
so
from
the
sensations
attendant
upon
certain
classes
of
his
thoughts
and
actions
he
gains
a
perception
of
an
external
being
who
reads
his
mind
to
whom
he
is
responsible
who
praises
and
blames
who
promises
and
threatens
as
i
am
only
illustrating
a
general
view
by
examples
i
shall
take
this
analogy
for
granted
here
as
then
we
have
our
initial
knowledge
of
the
universe
through
sense
so
do
we
in
the
first
instance
begin
to
learn
about
its
lord
and
god
from
conscience
and
as
from
particular
acts
of
that
instinct
which
makes
experiences
mere
images
as
they
ultimately
are
upon
the
retina
the
means
of
our
perceiving
something
real
beyond
them
we
go
on
to
draw
the
general
conclusion
that
there
is
a
vast
external
world
so
from
the
recurring
instances
in
which
conscience
acts
forcing
upon
us
importunately
the
mandate
of
a
superior
we
have
fresh
and
fresh
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
sovereign
ruler
from
whom
those
particular
dictates
which
we
experience
proceed
so
that
with
limitations
which
can
not
here
be
made
without
digressing
from
my
main
subject
we
may
by
means
of
that
induction
from
particular
experiences
of
conscience
have
as
good
a
warrant
for
concluding
the
ubiquitous
presence
of
one
supreme
master
as
we
have
from
parallel
experience
of
sense
for
assenting
to
the
fact
of
a
multiform
and
vast
world
material
and
mental
however
this
assent
is
notional
because
we
generalize
a
consistent
methodical
form
of
divine
unity
and
personality
with
its
attributes
from
particular
experiences
of
the
religious
instinct
which
are
themselves
only
not
and
in
the
imagination
not
intellectually
notices
of
its
presence
though
at
the
same
time
that
assent
may
become
real
of
course
as
may
the
assent
to
the
external
world
viz
when
we
apply
our
general
knowledge
to
a
particular
instance
of
that
knowledge
as
according
to
a
former
remark
the
general
varium
et
mutabile
was
realized
in
dido
and
in
thus
treating
the
origin
of
these
great
notions
i
am
not
forgetting
the
aid
which
from
our
earliest
years
we
receive
from
teachers
nor
am
i
denying
the
influence
of
certain
original
forms
of
thinking
or
formative
ideas
connatural
with
our
minds
without
which
we
could
not
reason
at
all
i
am
only
contemplating
the
mind
as
it
moves
in
fact
by
whatever
hidden
mechanism
as
a
locomotive
engine
could
not
move
without
steam
but
still
under
whatever
number
of
forces
it
certainly
does
start
from
birmingham
and
does
arrive
in
london
and
so
again
as
regards
the
first
principles
expressed
in
such
propositions
as
there
is
a
right
and
a
wrong
a
true
and
a
false
a
just
and
an
unjust
a
beautiful
and
a
deformed
they
are
abstractions
to
which
we
give
a
notional
assent
in
consequence
of
our
particular
experiences
of
qualities
in
the
concrete
to
which
we
give
a
real
assent
as
we
form
our
notion
of
whiteness
from
the
actual
sight
of
snow
milk
a
lily
or
a
cloud
so
after
experiencing
the
sentiment
of
approbation
which
arises
in
us
on
the
sight
of
certain
acts
one
by
one
we
go
on
to
assign
to
that
sentiment
a
cause
and
to
those
acts
a
quality
and
we
give
to
this
notional
cause
or
quality
the
name
of
virtue
which
is
an
abstraction
not
a
thing
and
in
like
manner
when
we
have
been
affected
by
a
certain
specific
admiring
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
this
or
that
concrete
object
we
proceed
by
an
arbitrary
act
of
the
mind
to
give
a
name
to
the
hypothetical
cause
or
quality
in
the
abstract
which
excites
it
we
speak
of
it
as
beautifulness
and
henceforth
when
we
call
a
thing
beautiful
we
mean
by
the
word
nothing
else
than
a
certain
quality
of
things
which
creates
in
us
this
special
sensation
these
first
principles
i
say
are
really
conclusions
or
abstractions
from
particular
experiences
and
an
assent
to
their
existence
is
not
an
assent
to
things
or
their
images
but
to
notions
real
assent
being
confined
to
the
propositions
directly
embodying
those
experiences
such
notions
indeed
are
an
evidence
of
the
reality
of
the
special
sentiments
in
particular
instances
without
which
they
would
not
have
been
formed
but
in
themselves
they
are
abstractions
from
facts
not
elementary
truths
prior
to
reasoning
i
am
not
of
course
dreaming
of
denying
the
objective
existence
of
the
moral
law
nor
our
instinctive
recognition
of
the
immutable
difference
in
the
moral
quality
of
acts
as
elicited
in
us
by
one
instance
of
them
even
one
act
of
cruelty
ingratitude
generosity
or
justice
reveals
to
us
at
once
the
immutable
distinction
between
those
qualities
and
their
contraries
that
is
in
that
particular
instance
and
hac
from
such
experience
which
is
ever
proceed
to
abstract
and
generalize
and
thus
the
abstract
proposition
there
is
a
right
and
a
wrong
as
representing
an
act
of
inference
is
received
by
the
mind
with
a
notional
not
a
real
assent
however
in
proportion
as
we
obey
the
particular
dictates
which
are
its
tokens
so
are
we
led
on
more
and
more
to
view
it
in
the
association
of
those
particulars
which
are
real
and
virtually
to
change
our
notion
of
it
into
the
image
of
that
objective
fact
which
in
each
particular
case
it
undeniably
is
another
of
these
presumptions
is
the
belief
in
causation
it
is
to
me
a
perplexity
that
grave
authors
seem
to
enunciate
as
an
intuitive
truth
that
every
thing
must
have
a
cause
if
this
were
so
the
voice
of
nature
would
tell
false
for
why
in
that
case
stop
short
at
one
who
is
himself
without
cause
the
assent
which
we
give
to
the
proposition
as
a
first
principle
that
nothing
happens
without
a
cause
is
derived
in
the
first
instance
from
what
we
know
of
ourselves
and
we
argue
analogically
from
what
is
within
us
to
what
is
external
to
us
one
of
the
first
experiences
of
an
infant
is
that
of
his
willing
and
doing
and
as
time
goes
on
one
of
the
first
temptations
of
the
boy
is
to
bring
home
to
himself
the
fact
of
his
sovereign
arbitrary
power
though
it
be
at
the
price
of
waywardness
mischievousness
and
disobedience
and
when
his
parents
as
antagonists
of
this
wilfulness
begin
to
restrain
him
and
to
bring
his
mind
and
conduct
into
shape
then
he
has
a
second
series
of
experiences
of
cause
and
effect
and
that
upon
a
principle
or
rule
thus
the
notion
of
causation
is
one
of
the
first
lessons
which
he
learns
from
experience
that
experience
limiting
it
to
agents
possessed
of
intelligence
and
will
it
is
the
notion
of
power
combined
with
a
purpose
and
an
end
physical
phenomena
as
such
are
without
sense
and
experience
teaches
us
nothing
about
physical
phenomena
as
causes
accordingly
wherever
the
world
is
young
the
movements
and
changes
of
physical
nature
have
been
and
are
spontaneously
ascribed
by
its
people
to
the
presence
and
will
of
hidden
agents
who
haunt
every
part
of
it
the
woods
the
mountains
and
the
streams
the
air
and
the
stars
for
good
or
for
evil
as
children
again
by
beating
the
ground
after
falling
imply
that
what
has
bruised
them
has
intelligence
is
there
anything
illogical
in
such
a
belief
it
rests
on
the
argument
from
analogy
as
time
goes
on
and
society
is
formed
and
the
idea
of
science
is
mastered
a
different
aspect
of
the
physical
universe
presents
itself
to
the
mind
since
causation
implies
a
sequence
of
acts
in
our
own
case
and
our
doing
is
always
posterior
never
contemporaneous
or
prior
to
our
willing
therefore
when
we
witness
invariable
antecedents
and
consequents
we
call
the
former
the
cause
of
the
latter
though
intelligence
is
absent
from
the
analogy
of
external
appearances
at
length
we
go
on
to
confuse
causation
with
order
and
because
we
happen
to
have
made
a
successful
analysis
of
some
complicated
assemblage
of
phenomena
which
experience
has
brought
before
us
in
the
visible
scene
of
things
and
have
reduced
them
to
a
tolerable
dependence
on
each
other
we
call
the
ultimate
points
of
this
analysis
and
the
hypothetical
facts
in
which
the
whole
mass
of
phenomena
is
gathered
up
by
the
name
of
causes
whereas
they
are
really
only
the
formula
under
which
those
phenomena
are
conveniently
represented
thus
the
constitutional
formula
the
king
can
do
no
wrong
is
not
a
fact
or
a
cause
of
the
constitution
but
a
happy
mode
of
bringing
out
its
genius
of
determining
the
correlations
of
its
elements
and
of
grouping
or
regulating
political
rules
and
proceedings
in
a
particular
direction
and
in
a
particular
form
and
in
like
manner
that
all
the
particles
of
matter
throughout
the
universe
are
attracted
to
each
other
with
a
force
varying
inversely
with
the
square
of
their
respective
distances
is
a
profound
idea
harmonizing
the
physical
works
of
the
creator
but
even
could
it
be
proved
to
be
a
universal
fact
and
also
to
be
the
actual
cause
of
the
movements
of
all
bodies
in
the
universe
still
it
would
not
be
an
experience
any
more
than
is
the
mythological
doctrine
of
the
presence
of
innumerable
spirits
in
physical
phenomena
of
these
two
senses
of
the
word
cause
viz
that
which
brings
a
thing
to
be
and
that
on
which
a
thing
under
given
circumstances
follows
the
former
is
that
of
which
our
experience
is
the
earlier
and
more
intimate
being
suggested
to
us
by
our
consciousness
of
willing
and
doing
the
latter
of
the
two
requires
a
discrimination
and
exactness
of
thought
for
its
apprehension
which
implies
special
mental
training
else
how
do
we
learn
to
call
food
the
cause
of
refreshment
but
day
never
the
cause
of
night
though
night
follows
day
more
surely
than
refreshment
follows
food
starting
then
from
experience
i
consider
a
cause
to
be
an
effective
will
and
by
the
doctrine
of
causation
i
mean
the
notion
or
first
principle
that
all
things
come
of
effective
will
and
the
reception
or
presumption
of
this
notion
is
a
notional
assent
as
to
causation
in
the
second
sense
viz
an
ordinary
succession
of
antecedents
and
consequents
or
what
is
called
the
order
of
nature
when
so
explained
it
falls
under
the
doctrine
of
general
laws
and
of
this
i
proceed
to
make
mention
as
another
first
principle
or
notion
derived
by
us
from
experience
and
accepted
with
what
i
have
called
a
presumption
by
natural
law
i
mean
the
fact
that
things
happen
uniformly
according
to
certain
circumstances
and
not
without
them
and
at
random
that
is
that
they
happen
in
an
order
and
as
all
things
in
the
universe
are
unit
and
individual
order
implies
a
certain
repetition
whether
of
things
or
like
things
or
of
their
affections
and
relations
thus
we
have
experience
for
instance
of
the
regularity
of
our
physical
functions
such
as
the
beating
of
the
pulse
and
the
heaving
of
the
breath
of
the
recurring
sensations
of
hunger
and
thirst
of
the
alternation
of
waking
and
sleeping
and
the
succession
of
youth
and
age
in
like
manner
we
have
experience
of
the
great
recurring
phenomena
of
the
heavens
and
earth
of
day
and
night
summer
and
winter
also
we
have
experience
of
a
like
uniform
succession
in
the
instance
of
fire
burning
water
choking
stones
falling
down
and
not
up
iron
moving
towards
a
magnet
friction
followed
by
sparks
and
crackling
an
oar
looking
bent
in
the
stream
and
compressed
steam
bursting
its
vessel
also
by
scientific
analysis
we
are
led
to
the
conclusion
that
phenomena
which
seem
very
different
from
each
other
admit
of
being
grouped
together
as
modes
of
the
operation
of
one
hypothetical
law
acting
under
varied
circumstances
for
instance
the
motion
of
a
stone
falling
freely
of
a
projectile
and
of
a
planet
may
be
generalized
as
one
and
the
same
property
in
each
of
them
of
the
particles
of
matter
and
this
generalization
loses
its
character
of
hypothesis
and
becomes
a
probability
in
proportion
as
we
have
reason
for
thinking
on
other
grounds
that
the
particles
of
all
matter
really
move
and
act
towards
each
other
in
one
certain
way
in
relation
to
space
and
time
and
not
in
half
a
dozen
ways
that
is
that
nature
acts
by
uniform
laws
and
thus
we
advance
to
the
general
notion
or
first
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
law
throughout
the
universe
there
are
philosophers
who
go
farther
and
teach
not
only
a
general
but
an
invariable
and
inviolable
and
necessary
uniformity
in
the
action
of
the
laws
of
nature
holding
that
every
thing
is
the
result
of
some
law
or
laws
and
that
exceptions
are
impossible
but
i
do
not
see
on
what
ground
of
experience
or
reason
they
take
up
this
position
our
experience
rather
is
adverse
to
such
a
doctrine
for
what
concrete
fact
or
phenomenon
exactly
repeats
itself
some
abstract
conception
of
it
more
perfect
than
the
recurrent
phenomenon
itself
is
necessary
before
we
are
able
to
say
that
it
has
happened
even
twice
and
the
variations
which
accompany
the
repetition
are
of
the
nature
of
exceptions
the
earth
for
instance
never
moves
exactly
in
the
same
orbit
year
by
year
but
is
in
perpetual
vacillation
it
will
indeed
be
replied
that
this
arises
from
the
interaction
of
one
law
with
another
of
which
the
actual
orbit
is
only
the
accidental
issue
that
the
earth
is
under
the
influence
of
a
variety
of
attractions
from
cosmical
bodies
and
that
if
it
is
subject
to
continual
aberrations
in
its
course
these
are
accounted
for
accurately
or
sufficiently
by
the
presence
of
those
extraordinary
and
variable
attractions
then
by
its
analytical
processes
sets
right
the
confusion
of
course
still
let
us
not
by
our
words
imply
that
we
are
appealing
to
experience
when
really
we
are
only
accounting
and
that
by
hypothesis
for
the
absence
of
experience
the
confusion
is
a
fact
the
reasoning
processes
are
not
facts
the
extraordinary
attractions
assigned
to
account
for
our
experience
of
that
confusion
are
not
themselves
experienced
phenomenal
facts
but
more
or
less
probable
hypotheses
argued
out
by
means
of
an
assumed
analogy
between
the
cosmical
bodies
to
which
those
attractions
are
referred
and
falling
bodies
on
the
earth
i
say
assumed
because
that
analogy
in
other
words
the
unfailing
uniformity
of
nature
is
the
very
point
which
has
to
be
proved
it
is
true
that
we
can
make
experiment
of
the
law
of
attraction
in
the
case
of
bodies
on
the
earth
but
i
repeat
to
assume
from
analogy
that
as
stones
do
fall
to
the
earth
so
jupiter
if
let
alone
would
fall
upon
the
earth
and
the
earth
upon
jupiter
and
with
certain
peculiarities
of
velocity
on
either
side
is
to
have
recourse
to
an
explanation
which
is
not
necessarily
valid
unless
nature
is
necessarily
uniform
nor
indeed
has
it
yet
been
proved
nor
ought
it
to
be
assumed
even
that
the
law
of
velocity
of
falling
bodies
on
the
earth
is
invariable
in
its
operation
for
that
again
is
only
an
instance
of
the
general
proposition
which
is
the
very
thesis
in
debate
it
seems
safer
then
to
hold
that
the
order
of
nature
is
not
necessary
but
general
in
its
manifestations
but
it
may
be
urged
if
a
thing
happens
once
it
must
happen
always
for
what
is
to
hinder
it
nay
on
the
contrary
why
because
one
particle
of
matter
has
a
certain
property
should
all
particles
have
the
same
why
because
particles
have
instanced
the
property
a
thousand
times
should
the
thousand
and
first
instance
it
also
it
is
unaccountable
that
an
accident
should
happen
twice
not
to
speak
of
its
happening
always
if
we
expect
a
thing
to
happen
twice
it
is
because
we
think
it
is
not
an
accident
but
has
a
cause
what
has
brought
about
a
thing
once
may
bring
it
about
twice
is
to
hinder
its
happening
rather
what
is
to
make
it
happen
here
we
are
thrown
back
from
the
question
of
order
to
that
of
causation
a
law
is
not
a
cause
but
a
fact
but
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
cause
then
as
i
have
said
we
have
no
experience
of
any
cause
but
will
if
then
i
must
answer
the
question
what
is
to
alter
the
order
of
nature
i
reply
that
which
willed
it
which
willed
it
can
unwill
it
and
the
invariableness
of
law
depends
on
the
unchangeableness
of
that
will
and
here
i
am
led
to
observe
that
as
a
cause
implies
a
will
so
order
implies
a
purpose
did
we
see
flint
celts
in
their
various
receptacles
all
over
europe
scored
always
with
certain
special
and
characteristic
marks
even
though
those
marks
had
no
assignable
meaning
or
final
cause
whatever
we
should
take
that
very
repetition
which
indeed
is
the
principle
of
order
to
be
a
proof
of
intelligence
the
agency
then
which
has
kept
up
and
keeps
up
the
general
laws
of
nature
energizing
at
once
in
sirius
and
on
the
earth
and
on
the
earth
in
its
primary
period
as
well
as
in
the
nineteenth
century
must
be
mind
and
nothing
else
and
mind
at
least
as
wide
and
as
enduring
in
its
living
action
as
the
immeasurable
ages
and
spaces
of
the
universe
on
which
that
agency
has
left
its
traces
in
these
remarks
i
have
digressed
from
my
immediate
subject
but
they
have
some
bearing
on
points
which
will
subsequently
come
into
discussion
speculation
is
one
of
those
words
which
in
the
vernacular
have
so
different
a
sense
from
what
they
bear
in
philosophy
it
is
commonly
taken
to
mean
a
conjecture
or
a
venture
on
chances
but
its
proper
meaning
is
mental
sight
or
the
contemplation
of
mental
operations
and
their
results
as
opposed
to
experience
experiment
or
sense
analogous
to
its
meaning
in
shakspeare
s
line
thou
hast
no
speculation
in
those
in
this
sense
i
use
it
here
and
i
use
it
in
this
sense
to
denote
those
notional
assents
which
are
the
most
direct
explicit
and
perfect
of
their
kind
viz
those
which
are
the
firm
conscious
acceptance
of
propositions
as
true
this
kind
of
assent
includes
the
assent
to
all
reasoning
and
its
conclusions
to
all
general
propositions
to
all
rules
of
conduct
to
all
proverbs
aphorisms
sayings
and
reflections
on
men
and
society
of
course
mathematical
investigations
and
truths
are
the
subjects
of
this
speculative
assent
so
are
legal
judgments
and
constitutional
maxims
as
far
as
they
appeal
to
us
for
assent
so
are
the
determinations
of
science
so
are
the
principles
disputations
and
doctrines
of
theology
that
there
is
a
god
that
he
has
certain
attributes
and
in
what
sense
he
can
be
said
to
have
attributes
that
he
has
done
certain
works
that
he
has
made
certain
revelations
of
himself
and
of
his
will
and
what
they
are
and
the
multiplied
bearings
of
the
parts
of
the
teaching
thus
developed
and
formed
upon
each
other
all
this
is
the
subject
of
notional
assent
and
of
that
particular
department
of
it
which
i
have
called
speculation
as
far
as
these
particular
subjects
can
be
viewed
in
the
concrete
and
represent
experiences
they
can
be
received
by
real
assent
also
but
as
expressed
in
general
propositions
they
belong
to
notional
apprehension
and
assent
real
assents
i
have
in
a
measure
anticipated
the
subject
of
real
assent
by
what
i
have
been
saying
about
notional
in
comparison
of
the
directness
and
force
of
the
apprehension
which
we
have
of
an
object
when
our
assent
is
to
be
called
real
notional
assent
and
inference
seem
to
be
thrown
back
into
one
and
the
same
class
of
intellectual
acts
though
the
former
of
the
two
is
always
an
unconditional
acceptance
of
a
proposition
and
the
latter
is
an
acceptance
on
the
condition
of
an
acceptance
of
its
premisses
in
its
notional
assents
as
well
as
in
its
inferences
the
mind
contemplates
its
own
creations
instead
of
things
in
real
it
is
directed
towards
things
represented
by
the
impressions
which
they
have
left
on
the
imagination
these
images
when
have
an
influence
both
on
the
individual
and
on
society
which
mere
notions
can
not
exert
i
have
already
given
various
illustrations
of
real
assent
i
will
follow
them
up
here
by
some
instances
of
the
change
of
notional
assent
into
real
for
instance
boys
at
school
look
like
each
other
and
pursue
the
same
studies
some
of
them
with
greater
success
than
others
but
it
will
sometimes
happen
that
those
who
acquitted
themselves
but
poorly
in
class
when
they
come
into
the
action
of
life
and
engage
in
some
particular
work
which
they
have
already
been
learning
in
its
theory
and
with
little
promise
of
proficiency
are
suddenly
found
to
have
what
is
called
an
eye
for
that
eye
for
trade
matters
or
for
engineering
or
a
special
taste
for
no
one
expected
from
them
at
school
while
they
were
engaged
on
notions
minds
of
this
stamp
not
only
know
the
received
rules
of
their
profession
but
enter
into
them
and
even
anticipate
them
or
dispense
with
them
or
substitute
other
rules
instead
and
when
new
questions
are
opened
and
arguments
are
drawn
up
on
one
side
and
the
other
in
long
array
they
with
a
natural
ease
and
promptness
form
their
views
and
give
their
decision
as
if
they
had
no
need
to
reason
from
their
clear
apprehension
of
the
lie
and
issue
of
the
whole
matter
in
dispute
as
if
it
were
drawn
out
in
a
map
before
them
these
are
the
reformers
systematizers
inventors
in
various
departments
of
thought
speculative
and
practical
in
education
in
administration
in
social
and
political
matters
in
science
such
men
indeed
are
far
from
infallible
however
great
their
powers
they
sometimes
fall
into
great
errors
in
their
own
special
department
while
men
who
go
by
rule
come
to
sound
and
safe
conclusions
images
need
not
be
true
but
i
am
illustrating
what
vividness
of
apprehension
is
and
what
is
the
strength
of
belief
consequent
upon
it
again
years
ago
the
duke
of
wellington
wrote
his
celebrated
letter
on
the
subject
of
the
national
defences
his
authority
gave
it
an
immediate
circulation
among
all
classes
of
the
community
none
questioned
what
he
said
nor
as
if
taking
his
words
on
faith
merely
but
as
intellectually
recognizing
their
truth
yet
few
could
be
said
to
see
or
feel
that
truth
his
letter
lay
so
to
say
upon
the
pure
intellect
of
the
national
mind
and
nothing
for
a
time
came
of
it
but
eleven
years
afterwards
after
his
death
the
anger
of
the
french
colonels
with
us
after
the
attempt
upon
louis
napoleon
s
life
transferred
its
facts
to
the
charge
of
the
imagination
then
forthwith
the
national
assent
became
in
various
ways
an
operative
principle
especially
in
its
promotion
of
the
volunteer
movement
the
duke
having
a
special
eye
for
military
matters
had
realized
the
state
of
things
from
the
first
but
it
took
a
course
of
years
to
impress
upon
the
public
mind
an
assent
to
his
warning
deeper
and
more
energetic
than
the
reception
it
is
accustomed
to
give
to
a
clever
article
in
a
newspaper
or
a
review
and
so
generally
great
truths
practical
or
ethical
float
on
the
surface
of
society
admitted
by
all
valued
by
few
exemplifying
the
poet
s
adage
probitas
laudatur
et
alget
until
changed
circumstances
accident
or
the
continual
pressure
of
their
advocates
force
them
upon
its
attention
the
iniquity
for
instance
of
the
ought
to
have
been
acknowledged
by
all
men
from
the
first
it
was
acknowledged
by
many
but
it
needed
an
organized
agitation
with
tracts
and
speeches
innumerable
so
to
affect
the
imagination
of
men
as
to
make
their
acknowledgment
of
that
iniquitousness
operative
in
like
manner
when
wilberforce
after
succeeding
in
the
slave
question
urged
the
duke
of
wellington
to
use
his
great
influence
in
discountenancing
duelling
he
could
only
get
from
him
in
answer
a
relic
of
barbarism
wilberforce
as
if
he
accepted
a
notion
without
realizing
a
fact
at
length
the
growing
intelligence
of
the
community
and
the
shock
inflicted
upon
it
by
the
tragical
circumstances
of
a
particular
duel
were
fatal
to
that
barbarism
the
governing
classes
were
roused
from
their
dreamy
acquiescence
in
an
abstract
truth
and
recognized
the
duty
of
giving
it
practical
expression
let
us
consider
too
how
differently
young
and
old
are
affected
by
the
words
of
some
classic
author
such
as
homer
or
horace
passages
which
to
a
boy
are
but
rhetorical
commonplaces
neither
better
nor
worse
than
a
hundred
others
which
any
clever
writer
might
supply
which
he
gets
by
heart
and
thinks
very
fine
and
imitates
as
he
thinks
successfully
in
his
own
flowing
versification
at
length
come
home
to
him
when
long
years
have
passed
and
he
has
had
experience
of
life
and
pierce
him
as
if
he
had
never
before
known
them
with
their
sad
earnestness
and
vivid
exactness
then
he
comes
to
understand
how
it
is
that
lines
the
birth
of
some
chance
morning
or
evening
at
an
ionian
festival
or
among
the
sabine
hills
have
lasted
generation
after
generation
for
thousands
of
years
with
a
power
over
the
mind
and
a
charm
which
the
current
literature
of
his
own
day
with
all
its
obvious
advantages
is
utterly
unable
to
rival
perhaps
this
is
the
reason
of
the
medieval
opinion
about
virgil
as
if
a
prophet
or
magician
his
single
words
and
phrases
his
pathetic
half
lines
giving
utterance
as
the
voice
of
nature
herself
to
that
pain
and
weariness
yet
hope
of
better
things
which
is
the
experience
of
her
children
in
every
time
and
what
the
experience
of
the
world
effects
for
the
illustration
of
classical
authors
that
office
the
religious
sense
carefully
cultivated
fulfils
towards
holy
scripture
to
the
devout
and
spiritual
the
divine
word
speaks
of
things
not
merely
of
notions
and
again
to
the
disconsolate
the
tempted
the
perplexed
the
suffering
there
comes
by
means
of
their
very
trials
an
enlargement
of
thought
which
enables
them
to
see
in
it
what
they
never
saw
before
henceforth
there
is
to
them
a
reality
in
its
teachings
which
they
recognize
as
an
argument
and
the
best
of
arguments
for
its
divine
origin
hence
the
practice
of
meditation
on
the
sacred
text
so
highly
thought
of
by
catholics
reading
as
we
do
the
gospels
from
our
youth
up
we
are
in
danger
of
becoming
so
familiar
with
them
as
to
be
dead
to
their
force
and
to
view
them
as
a
mere
history
the
purpose
then
of
meditation
is
to
realize
them
to
make
the
facts
which
they
relate
stand
out
before
our
minds
as
objects
such
as
may
be
appropriated
by
a
faith
as
living
as
the
imagination
which
apprehends
them
it
is
obvious
to
refer
to
the
unworthy
use
made
of
the
more
solemn
parts
of
the
sacred
volume
by
the
mere
popular
preacher
his
very
mode
of
reading
whether
warnings
or
prayers
is
as
if
he
thought
them
to
be
little
more
than
fine
writing
poetical
in
sense
musical
in
sound
and
worthy
of
inspiration
the
most
awful
truths
are
to
him
but
sublime
or
beautiful
conceptions
and
are
adduced
and
used
by
him
in
season
and
out
of
season
for
his
own
purposes
for
embellishing
his
style
or
rounding
his
periods
but
let
his
heart
at
length
be
ploughed
by
some
keen
grief
or
deep
anxiety
and
scripture
is
a
new
book
to
him
this
is
the
change
which
so
often
takes
place
in
what
is
called
religious
conversion
and
it
is
a
change
so
far
simply
for
the
better
by
whatever
infirmity
or
error
it
is
in
the
particular
case
accompanied
and
it
is
strikingly
suggested
to
us
to
take
a
saintly
example
in
the
confession
of
the
patriarch
job
when
he
contrasts
his
apprehension
of
the
almighty
before
and
after
his
afflictions
he
says
he
had
indeed
a
true
apprehension
of
the
divine
attributes
before
as
well
as
after
but
with
the
trial
came
a
great
change
in
the
character
of
that
apprehension
with
the
hearing
of
the
ear
he
says
i
have
heard
thee
but
now
mine
eye
seeth
thee
therefore
i
reprehend
myself
and
do
penance
in
dust
and
let
these
instances
suffice
of
real
assent
in
its
relation
to
notional
they
lead
me
to
make
three
remarks
in
further
illustration
of
its
character
the
fact
of
the
distinctness
of
the
images
which
are
required
for
real
assent
is
no
warrant
for
the
existence
of
the
objects
which
those
images
represent
a
proposition
be
it
ever
so
keenly
apprehended
may
be
true
or
may
be
false
if
we
simply
put
aside
all
inferential
information
such
as
is
derived
from
testimony
from
general
belief
from
the
concurrence
of
the
senses
from
common
sense
or
otherwise
we
have
no
right
to
consider
that
we
have
apprehended
a
truth
merely
because
of
the
strength
of
our
mental
impression
of
it
hence
the
proverb
fronti
nulla
an
image
with
the
characters
of
perfect
veracity
and
faithfulness
may
be
ever
so
distinct
and
eloquent
an
object
presented
before
the
mind
or
as
it
is
sometimes
called
an
objectum
internum
or
a
but
nevertheless
there
may
be
no
external
reality
in
the
case
corresponding
to
it
in
spite
of
its
impressiveness
one
of
the
most
remarkable
instances
of
this
fallacious
impressiveness
is
the
illusion
which
possesses
the
minds
of
able
men
those
especially
who
are
exercised
in
physical
investigations
in
favour
of
the
inviolability
of
the
laws
of
nature
philosophers
of
the
school
of
hume
discard
the
very
supposition
of
miracles
and
scornfully
refuse
to
hear
evidence
in
their
behalf
in
given
instances
from
their
intimate
experience
of
physical
order
and
of
the
connexion
of
antecedent
and
consequent
their
imagination
usurps
the
functions
of
reason
and
they
can
not
bring
themselves
even
to
entertain
as
a
hypothesis
and
this
is
all
that
they
are
asked
to
do
a
thought
contrary
to
that
vivid
impression
of
which
they
are
the
victims
that
the
uniformity
of
nature
which
they
witness
hour
by
hour
is
equivalent
to
a
necessary
inviolable
law
yet
it
is
plain
and
i
shall
take
it
for
granted
here
that
when
i
assent
to
a
proposition
i
ought
to
have
some
more
legitimate
reason
for
doing
so
than
the
brilliancy
of
the
image
of
which
that
proposition
is
the
expression
that
i
have
no
experience
of
a
thing
happening
except
in
one
way
is
a
cause
of
the
intensity
of
my
assent
if
i
assent
but
not
the
reason
of
my
assenting
in
saying
this
i
am
not
disposed
to
deny
the
presence
in
some
men
of
an
idiosyncratic
sagacity
which
really
and
rightly
sees
reasons
in
impressions
which
common
men
can
not
see
and
is
secured
from
the
peril
of
confusing
truth
with
but
this
is
genius
and
beyond
rule
i
grant
too
of
course
that
accidentally
impressiveness
does
in
matter
of
fact
as
in
the
instance
which
i
have
been
giving
constitute
the
motive
principle
of
belief
for
the
mind
is
ever
exposed
to
the
danger
of
being
carried
away
by
the
liveliness
of
its
conceptions
to
the
sacrifice
of
good
sense
and
conscientious
caution
and
the
greater
and
the
more
rare
are
its
gifts
the
greater
is
the
risk
of
swerving
from
the
line
of
reason
and
duty
but
here
i
am
not
speaking
of
transgressions
of
rule
any
more
than
of
exceptions
to
it
but
of
the
normal
constitution
of
our
minds
and
of
the
natural
and
rightful
effect
of
acts
of
the
imagination
upon
us
and
this
is
not
to
create
assent
but
to
intensify
it
next
assent
however
strong
and
accorded
to
images
however
vivid
is
not
therefore
necessarily
practical
strictly
speaking
it
is
not
imagination
that
causes
action
but
hope
and
fear
likes
and
dislikes
appetite
passion
affection
the
stirrings
of
selfishness
and
what
imagination
does
for
us
is
to
find
a
means
of
stimulating
those
motive
powers
and
it
does
so
by
providing
a
supply
of
objects
strong
enough
to
stimulate
them
the
thought
of
honour
glory
duty
gain
or
on
the
other
hand
of
divine
goodness
future
reward
eternal
life
perseveringly
dwelt
upon
leads
us
along
a
course
of
action
corresponding
to
itself
but
only
in
case
there
be
that
in
our
minds
which
is
congenial
to
it
however
when
there
is
that
preparation
of
mind
the
thought
does
lead
to
the
act
hence
it
is
that
the
fact
of
a
proposition
being
accepted
with
a
real
assent
is
accidentally
an
earnest
of
that
proposition
being
carried
out
in
conduct
and
the
imagination
may
be
said
in
some
sense
to
be
of
a
practical
nature
inasmuch
as
it
leads
to
practice
indirectly
by
the
action
of
its
object
upon
the
affections
there
is
a
third
remark
suggested
by
the
view
which
i
have
been
taking
of
real
assents
viz
that
they
are
of
a
personal
character
each
individual
having
his
own
and
being
known
by
them
it
is
otherwise
with
notions
notional
apprehension
is
in
itself
an
ordinary
act
of
our
common
nature
all
of
us
have
the
power
of
abstraction
and
can
be
taught
either
to
make
or
to
enter
into
the
same
abstractions
and
thus
to
in
the
establishment
of
a
common
measure
between
mind
and
mind
and
though
for
one
and
all
of
us
to
assent
to
the
notions
which
we
thus
apprehend
in
common
is
a
further
step
as
requiring
the
adoption
of
a
common
of
principle
and
judgment
yet
this
too
depends
in
good
measure
on
certain
logical
processes
of
thought
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
and
on
facts
which
we
all
take
for
granted
but
we
can
not
make
sure
for
ourselves
or
others
of
real
apprehension
and
assent
because
we
have
to
secure
first
the
images
which
are
their
objects
and
these
are
often
peculiar
and
special
they
depend
on
personal
experience
and
the
experience
of
one
man
is
not
the
experience
of
another
real
assent
then
as
the
experience
which
it
presupposes
is
proper
to
the
individual
and
as
such
thwarts
rather
than
promotes
the
intercourse
of
man
with
man
it
shuts
itself
up
as
it
were
in
its
own
home
or
at
least
it
is
its
own
witness
and
its
own
standard
and
as
in
the
instances
above
given
it
can
not
be
reckoned
on
anticipated
accounted
for
inasmuch
as
it
is
the
accident
of
this
man
or
that
i
call
the
characteristics
of
an
individual
accidents
in
spite
of
the
universal
reign
of
law
because
they
are
severally
the
of
many
laws
and
there
are
no
laws
as
yet
discovered
of
such
coincidence
a
man
who
is
run
over
in
the
street
and
killed
in
one
sense
suffers
according
to
rule
or
law
he
was
crossing
he
was
or
preoccupied
in
mind
or
he
was
looking
another
way
he
was
deaf
lame
or
flurried
and
the
cab
came
up
at
a
great
pace
if
all
this
was
so
it
was
by
a
necessity
that
he
was
run
over
it
would
have
been
a
miracle
if
he
had
escaped
so
far
is
clear
but
what
is
not
clear
is
how
all
these
various
conditions
met
together
in
the
particular
case
how
it
was
that
a
man
hard
of
hearing
deficient
in
presence
of
mind
happened
to
get
in
the
way
of
a
cab
hurrying
along
to
catch
a
train
this
concrete
fact
does
not
come
under
any
law
of
sudden
deaths
but
like
the
earth
s
yearly
path
which
i
spoke
of
above
is
the
accident
of
the
individual
it
does
not
meet
the
case
to
refer
to
the
law
of
averages
for
such
laws
deal
with
percentages
not
with
individuals
and
it
is
about
individuals
that
i
am
speaking
that
this
particular
man
out
of
the
three
millions
congregated
in
the
metropolis
was
to
have
the
experience
of
this
catastrophe
and
to
be
the
select
victim
to
appease
that
law
of
averages
no
statistical
tables
could
foretell
even
though
they
could
determine
that
it
was
in
the
fates
that
in
that
week
or
day
some
four
persons
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
london
should
be
run
over
and
in
like
manner
that
this
or
that
person
should
have
the
particular
experiences
necessary
for
real
assent
on
any
point
that
the
deist
should
become
a
theist
the
erastian
a
catholic
the
protectionist
a
the
conservative
a
legitimist
the
high
tory
an
democrat
are
facts
each
of
which
may
be
the
result
of
a
multitude
of
coincidences
in
one
and
the
same
individual
coincidences
which
we
have
no
means
of
determining
and
which
therefore
we
may
call
accidents
there
s
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
rough
hew
them
how
we
such
accidents
are
the
characteristics
of
persons
as
and
properties
are
the
characteristics
of
species
or
natures
that
a
man
dies
when
deprived
of
air
is
not
an
accident
of
his
person
but
a
law
of
his
nature
that
he
can
not
live
without
quinine
or
opium
or
out
of
the
climate
of
madeira
is
his
own
peculiarity
if
all
men
every
where
usually
had
the
yellow
fever
once
in
their
lives
we
should
call
it
speaking
according
to
our
knowledge
a
law
of
the
human
constitution
if
the
inhabitants
of
a
particular
country
commonly
had
it
we
should
call
it
a
law
of
the
climate
if
a
healthy
man
has
a
fever
in
a
healthy
place
in
a
healthy
season
we
call
it
an
accident
though
it
be
reducible
to
the
coincidence
of
laws
because
there
is
no
known
law
of
their
coincidence
to
be
rational
to
have
speech
to
pass
through
successive
changes
of
mind
and
body
from
infancy
to
death
belong
to
man
s
nature
to
have
a
particular
history
to
be
married
or
single
to
have
children
or
to
be
childless
to
live
a
given
number
of
years
to
have
a
certain
constitution
moral
temperament
intellectual
outfit
mental
formation
these
and
the
like
taken
all
together
are
the
accidents
which
make
up
our
notion
of
a
man
s
person
and
are
the
or
condition
of
his
particular
experiences
moreover
various
of
the
experiences
which
befall
this
man
may
be
the
same
as
those
which
befall
that
although
those
experiences
result
each
from
the
combination
of
its
own
accidents
and
are
ultimately
traceable
each
to
its
own
special
condition
or
history
that
is
images
which
are
possessed
in
common
with
their
apprehensions
and
assents
may
nevertheless
be
personal
characteristics
if
two
or
three
hundred
men
are
to
be
found
who
can
not
live
out
of
madeira
that
inability
would
still
be
an
accident
and
a
peculiarity
of
each
of
them
even
if
in
each
case
it
implied
delicacy
of
lungs
still
that
delicacy
is
a
vague
notion
comprehending
under
it
a
great
variety
of
cases
in
detail
if
five
hundred
brethren
at
once
saw
our
risen
lord
that
common
experience
would
not
be
a
law
but
a
personal
accident
which
was
the
prerogative
of
each
and
so
again
in
this
day
the
belief
of
so
many
thousands
in
his
divinity
is
not
therefore
notional
because
it
is
common
but
may
be
a
real
and
personal
belief
being
produced
in
different
individual
minds
by
various
experiences
and
disposing
causes
variously
combined
such
as
a
warm
or
strong
imagination
great
sensibility
compunction
and
horror
at
sin
frequenting
the
mass
and
other
rites
of
the
church
meditating
on
the
contents
of
the
gospels
familiarity
with
hymns
and
religious
poems
dwelling
on
the
evidences
parental
example
and
instruction
religious
friends
strange
providences
powerful
preaching
in
each
case
the
image
in
the
mind
with
the
experiences
out
of
which
it
is
formed
would
be
a
personal
result
and
though
the
same
in
all
would
in
each
case
be
so
idiosyncratic
in
its
circumstances
that
it
would
stand
by
itself
a
special
formation
unconnected
with
any
law
though
at
the
same
time
it
would
necessarily
be
a
principle
of
sympathy
and
a
bond
of
intercourse
between
those
whose
minds
had
been
thus
variously
wrought
into
a
common
assent
far
stronger
than
could
follow
upon
any
multitude
of
mere
notions
which
they
unanimously
held
and
even
when
that
assent
is
not
the
result
of
concurrent
causes
if
such
a
case
is
possible
but
has
one
single
origin
as
the
study
of
scripture
careful
teaching
or
a
religious
temper
still
its
presence
argues
a
special
history
and
a
personal
formation
which
an
abstraction
does
not
for
an
abstraction
can
be
made
at
will
and
may
be
the
work
of
a
moment
but
the
moral
experiences
which
perpetuate
themselves
in
images
must
be
sought
after
in
order
to
be
found
and
encouraged
and
cultivated
in
order
to
be
appropriated
i
have
now
said
all
that
occurs
to
me
on
the
subject
of
real
assents
perhaps
not
without
some
risk
of
subtlety
and
minuteness
they
are
sometimes
called
beliefs
convictions
certitudes
and
as
given
to
moral
objects
they
are
perhaps
as
rare
as
they
are
powerful
till
we
have
them
in
spite
of
a
full
apprehension
and
assent
in
the
field
of
notions
we
have
no
intellectual
moorings
and
are
at
the
mercy
of
impulses
fancies
and
wandering
lights
whether
as
regards
personal
conduct
social
and
political
action
or
religion
these
beliefs
be
they
true
or
false
in
the
particular
case
form
the
mind
out
of
which
they
grow
and
impart
to
it
a
seriousness
and
manliness
which
inspires
in
other
minds
a
confidence
in
its
views
and
is
one
secret
of
persuasiveness
and
influence
in
the
public
stage
of
the
world
they
create
as
the
case
may
be
heroes
and
saints
great
leaders
statesmen
preachers
and
reformers
the
pioneers
of
discovery
in
science
visionaries
fanatics
demagogues
and
adventurers
they
have
given
to
the
world
men
of
one
idea
of
immense
energy
of
adamantine
will
of
revolutionary
power
they
kindle
sympathies
between
man
and
man
and
knit
together
the
innumerable
units
which
constitute
a
race
and
a
nation
they
become
the
principle
of
its
political
existence
they
impart
to
it
homogeneity
of
thought
and
fellowship
of
purpose
they
have
given
form
to
the
medieval
theocracy
and
to
the
mahometan
superstition
they
are
now
the
life
both
of
holy
russia
and
of
that
freedom
of
speech
and
action
which
is
the
special
boast
of
englishmen
notional
and
real
assents
contrasted
it
appears
from
what
has
been
said
that
though
real
assent
is
not
intrinsically
operative
it
accidentally
and
indirectly
affects
practice
it
is
in
itself
an
intellectual
act
of
which
the
object
is
presented
to
it
by
the
imagination
and
though
the
pure
intellect
does
not
lead
to
action
nor
the
imagination
either
yet
the
imagination
has
the
means
which
pure
intellect
has
not
of
stimulating
those
powers
of
the
mind
from
which
action
proceeds
real
assent
then
or
belief
as
it
may
be
called
viewed
in
itself
that
is
simply
as
assent
does
not
lead
to
action
but
the
images
in
which
it
lives
representing
as
they
do
the
concrete
have
the
power
of
the
concrete
upon
the
affections
and
passions
and
by
means
of
these
indirectly
become
operative
still
this
practical
influence
is
not
invariable
nor
to
be
relied
on
for
given
images
may
have
no
tendency
to
affect
given
minds
or
to
excite
them
to
action
thus
a
philosopher
or
a
poet
may
vividly
realize
the
brilliant
rewards
of
military
genius
or
of
eloquence
without
wishing
either
to
be
a
commander
or
an
orator
however
on
the
whole
broadly
contrasting
belief
with
notional
assent
and
with
inference
we
shall
not
with
this
explanation
be
very
wrong
in
pronouncing
that
acts
of
notional
assent
and
of
inference
do
not
affect
our
conduct
and
acts
of
belief
that
is
of
real
assent
do
not
necessarily
but
do
affect
it
i
have
scarcely
spoken
of
inference
since
my
introductory
chapter
though
i
intend
before
i
conclude
to
consider
it
fully
but
i
have
said
enough
to
admit
of
my
introducing
it
here
in
contrast
with
real
assent
or
belief
and
that
contrast
is
necessary
in
order
to
complete
what
i
have
been
saying
about
the
latter
let
me
then
for
the
sake
of
the
latter
be
allowed
here
to
say
that
while
assent
or
belief
presupposes
some
apprehension
of
the
things
believed
inference
requires
no
apprehension
of
the
things
inferred
that
in
consequence
inference
is
necessarily
concerned
with
surfaces
and
aspects
that
it
begins
with
itself
and
ends
with
itself
that
it
does
not
reach
as
far
as
facts
that
it
is
employed
upon
formulas
that
as
far
as
it
takes
real
objects
of
whatever
kind
into
account
such
as
motives
and
actions
character
and
conduct
art
science
taste
morals
religion
it
deals
with
them
not
as
they
are
but
simply
in
its
own
line
as
materials
of
argument
or
inquiry
that
they
are
to
it
nothing
more
than
major
and
minor
premisses
and
conclusions
belief
on
the
other
hand
being
concerned
with
things
concrete
not
abstract
which
variously
excite
the
mind
from
their
moral
and
imaginative
properties
has
for
its
object
not
only
directly
what
is
true
but
inclusively
what
is
beautiful
useful
admirable
heroic
objects
which
kindle
devotion
rouse
the
passions
and
attach
the
affections
and
thus
it
leads
the
way
to
actions
of
every
kind
to
the
establishment
of
principles
and
the
formation
of
character
and
is
thus
again
intimately
connected
with
what
is
individual
and
personal
i
insisted
on
this
marked
distinction
between
beliefs
on
the
one
hand
and
notional
assents
and
inferences
on
the
other
many
years
ago
in
words
which
it
will
be
to
my
purpose
to
use
now
i
quote
them
because
over
and
above
their
appositeness
in
this
place
they
present
the
doctrine
on
which
i
have
been
insisting
from
a
second
point
of
view
and
with
a
freshness
and
force
which
i
can
not
now
command
and
moreover
though
they
are
my
own
nevertheless
from
the
length
of
time
which
has
elapsed
since
their
publication
almost
with
the
cogency
of
an
independent
testimony
they
occur
in
a
protest
which
i
had
occasion
to
write
in
february
against
a
dangerous
doctrine
maintained
as
i
considered
by
two
very
eminent
men
of
that
day
now
no
brougham
and
sir
robert
peel
that
doctrine
was
to
the
effect
that
the
claims
of
religion
could
be
secured
and
sustained
in
the
mass
of
men
and
in
particular
in
the
lower
classes
of
society
by
acquaintance
with
literature
and
physical
science
and
through
the
instrumentality
of
mechanics
institutes
and
reading
rooms
to
the
serious
disparagement
as
it
seemed
to
me
of
direct
christian
instruction
in
the
course
of
my
remarks
is
found
the
passage
which
i
shall
here
quote
and
which
with
whatever
differences
in
terminology
and
hardihood
of
assertion
befitting
the
circumstances
of
its
publication
nay
as
far
as
words
go
inaccuracy
of
theological
statement
suitably
illustrates
the
subject
here
under
discussion
it
runs
thus
people
say
to
me
that
it
is
but
a
dream
to
suppose
that
christianity
should
regain
the
organic
power
in
human
society
which
once
it
possessed
i
can
not
help
that
i
never
said
it
could
i
am
not
a
politician
i
am
proposing
no
measures
but
exposing
a
fallacy
and
resisting
a
pretence
let
benthamism
reign
if
men
have
no
aspirations
but
do
not
tell
them
to
be
romantic
and
then
solace
them
with
glory
do
not
attempt
by
philosophy
what
once
was
done
by
religion
the
ascendency
of
faith
may
be
impracticable
but
the
reign
of
knowledge
is
incomprehensible
the
problem
for
statesmen
of
this
age
is
how
to
educate
the
masses
and
literature
and
science
can
not
give
the
solution
science
gives
us
the
grounds
or
premisses
from
which
religious
truths
are
to
be
enforced
but
it
does
not
set
about
inferring
them
much
less
does
it
reach
the
is
not
its
province
it
brings
before
us
phenomena
and
it
leaves
us
if
we
will
to
call
them
works
of
design
wisdom
or
benevolence
and
further
still
if
we
will
to
proceed
to
confess
an
intelligent
creator
we
have
to
take
its
facts
and
to
give
them
a
meaning
and
to
draw
our
own
conclusions
from
them
first
comes
knowledge
then
a
view
then
reasoning
and
then
belief
this
is
why
science
has
so
little
of
a
religious
tendency
deductions
have
no
power
of
persuasion
the
heart
is
commonly
reached
not
through
the
reason
but
through
the
imagination
by
means
of
direct
impressions
by
the
testimony
of
facts
and
events
by
history
by
description
persons
influence
us
voices
melt
us
looks
subdue
us
deeds
inflame
us
many
a
man
will
live
and
die
upon
a
dogma
no
man
will
be
a
martyr
for
a
conclusion
a
conclusion
is
but
an
opinion
it
is
not
a
thing
which
but
which
we
are
sure
and
it
has
often
been
observed
that
we
never
say
we
are
sure
and
certain
without
implying
that
we
doubt
to
say
that
a
thing
be
is
to
admit
that
it
be
no
one
i
say
will
die
for
his
own
calculations
he
dies
for
realities
this
is
why
a
literary
religion
is
so
little
to
be
depended
upon
it
looks
well
in
fair
weather
but
its
doctrines
are
opinions
and
when
called
to
suffer
for
them
it
slips
them
between
its
folios
or
burns
them
at
its
hearth
and
this
again
is
the
secret
of
the
distrust
and
raillery
with
which
moralists
have
been
so
commonly
visited
they
say
and
do
not
why
because
they
are
contemplating
the
fitness
of
things
and
they
live
by
the
square
when
they
should
be
realizing
their
high
maxims
in
the
concrete
now
sir
robert
peel
thinks
better
of
natural
history
chemistry
and
astronomy
than
of
such
ethics
but
these
too
what
are
they
more
than
divinity
he
protests
against
divinity
is
much
better
i
have
no
confidence
then
in
philosophers
who
can
not
help
being
religious
and
are
christians
by
implication
they
sit
at
home
and
reach
forward
to
distances
which
astonish
us
but
they
hit
without
grasping
and
are
sometimes
as
confident
about
shadows
as
about
realities
they
have
worked
out
by
a
calculation
the
lie
of
a
country
which
they
never
saw
and
mapped
it
by
means
of
a
gazetteer
and
like
blind
men
though
they
can
put
a
stranger
on
his
way
they
can
not
walk
straight
themselves
and
do
not
feel
it
quite
their
business
to
walk
at
all
logic
makes
but
a
sorry
rhetoric
with
the
multitude
first
shoot
round
corners
and
you
may
not
despair
of
converting
by
a
syllogism
tell
men
to
gain
notions
of
a
creator
from
his
works
and
if
they
were
to
set
about
it
which
nobody
does
they
would
be
jaded
and
wearied
by
the
labyrinth
they
were
tracing
their
minds
would
be
gorged
and
surfeited
by
the
logical
operation
logicians
are
more
set
upon
concluding
rightly
than
on
right
conclusions
they
can
not
see
the
end
for
the
process
few
men
have
that
power
of
mind
which
may
hold
fast
and
firmly
a
variety
of
thoughts
we
ridicule
men
of
one
idea
but
a
great
many
of
us
are
born
to
be
such
and
we
should
be
happier
if
we
knew
it
to
most
men
argument
makes
the
point
in
hand
only
more
doubtful
and
considerably
less
impressive
after
all
man
is
a
reasoning
animal
he
is
a
seeing
feeling
contemplating
acting
animal
he
is
influenced
by
what
is
direct
and
precise
it
is
very
well
to
freshen
our
impressions
and
convictions
from
physics
but
to
create
them
we
must
go
elsewhere
sir
robert
peel
never
can
think
it
possible
that
a
mind
can
be
so
constituted
that
after
being
familiarized
with
the
wonderful
discoveries
which
have
been
made
in
every
part
of
experimental
science
it
can
retire
from
such
contemplation
without
more
enlarged
conceptions
of
god
s
providence
and
a
higher
reverence
for
his
name
if
he
speaks
of
religious
minds
he
perpetrates
a
truism
if
of
irreligious
he
insinuates
a
paradox
life
is
not
long
enough
for
a
religion
of
inferences
we
shall
never
have
done
beginning
if
we
determine
to
begin
with
proof
we
shall
ever
be
laying
our
foundations
we
shall
turn
theology
into
evidences
and
divines
into
textuaries
we
shall
never
get
at
our
first
principles
resolve
to
believe
nothing
and
you
must
prove
your
proof
and
analyze
your
elements
sinking
farther
and
farther
and
finding
in
the
lowest
depth
a
lower
deep
till
you
come
to
the
broad
bosom
of
scepticism
i
would
rather
be
bound
to
defend
the
reasonableness
of
assuming
that
christianity
is
true
than
to
demonstrate
a
moral
governance
from
the
physical
world
life
is
for
action
if
we
insist
on
proofs
for
every
thing
we
shall
never
come
to
action
to
act
you
must
assume
and
that
assumption
is
faith
let
no
one
suppose
that
in
saying
this
i
am
maintaining
that
all
proofs
are
equally
difficult
and
all
propositions
equally
debatable
some
assumptions
are
greater
than
others
and
some
doctrines
involve
postulates
larger
than
others
and
more
numerous
i
only
say
that
impressions
lead
to
action
and
that
reasonings
lead
from
it
knowledge
of
premisses
and
inferences
upon
them
is
not
to
it
is
very
well
as
a
matter
of
liberal
curiosity
and
of
philosophy
to
analyze
our
modes
of
thought
but
let
this
come
second
and
when
there
is
leisure
for
it
and
then
our
examinations
will
in
many
ways
even
be
subservient
to
action
but
if
we
commence
with
scientific
knowledge
and
argumentative
proof
or
lay
any
great
stress
upon
it
as
the
basis
of
personal
christianity
or
attempt
to
make
man
moral
and
religious
by
libraries
and
museums
let
us
in
consistency
take
chemists
for
our
cooks
and
mineralogists
for
our
masons
now
i
wish
to
state
all
this
as
matter
of
fact
to
be
judged
by
the
candid
testimony
of
any
persons
whatever
why
we
are
so
constituted
that
faith
not
knowledge
or
argument
is
our
principle
of
action
is
a
question
with
which
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
i
think
it
is
a
fact
and
if
it
be
such
we
must
resign
ourselves
to
it
as
best
we
may
unless
we
take
refuge
in
the
intolerable
paradox
that
the
mass
of
men
are
created
for
nothing
and
are
meant
to
leave
life
as
they
entered
it
so
well
has
this
practically
been
understood
in
all
ages
of
the
world
that
no
religion
yet
has
been
a
religion
of
physics
or
of
philosophy
it
has
ever
been
synonymous
with
revelation
it
never
has
been
a
deduction
from
what
we
know
it
has
ever
been
an
assertion
of
what
we
are
to
believe
it
has
never
lived
in
a
conclusion
it
has
ever
been
a
message
a
history
or
a
vision
no
legislator
or
priest
ever
dreamed
of
educating
our
moral
nature
by
science
or
by
argument
there
is
no
difference
here
between
true
religions
and
pretended
moses
was
instructed
not
to
reason
from
the
creation
but
to
work
miracles
christianity
is
a
history
supernatural
and
almost
scenic
it
tells
us
what
its
author
is
by
telling
us
what
he
has
done
lord
brougham
himself
has
recognized
the
force
of
this
principle
he
has
not
left
his
philosophical
religion
to
argument
he
has
committed
it
to
the
keeping
of
the
imagination
why
should
he
depict
a
great
republic
of
letters
and
an
intellectual
pantheon
but
that
he
feels
that
instances
and
patterns
not
logical
reasonings
are
the
living
conclusions
which
alone
have
a
hold
over
the
affections
or
can
form
the
character
chapter
apprehension
and
assent
in
the
matter
of
religion
we
are
now
able
to
determine
what
a
dogma
of
faith
is
and
what
it
is
to
believe
it
a
dogma
is
a
proposition
it
stands
for
a
notion
or
for
a
thing
and
to
believe
it
is
to
give
the
assent
of
the
mind
to
it
as
it
stands
for
the
one
or
for
the
other
to
give
a
real
assent
to
it
is
an
act
of
religion
to
give
a
notional
is
a
theological
act
it
is
discerned
rested
in
and
appropriated
as
a
reality
by
the
religious
imagination
it
is
held
as
a
truth
by
the
theological
intellect
not
as
if
there
were
in
fact
or
could
be
any
line
of
demarcation
or
between
these
two
modes
of
assent
the
religious
and
the
theological
as
intellect
is
common
to
all
men
as
well
as
imagination
every
religious
man
is
to
a
certain
extent
a
theologian
and
no
theology
can
start
or
thrive
without
the
initiative
and
abiding
presence
of
religion
as
in
matters
of
this
world
sense
sensation
instinct
intuition
supply
us
with
facts
and
the
intellect
uses
them
so
as
regards
our
relations
with
the
supreme
being
we
get
our
facts
from
the
witness
first
of
nature
then
of
revelation
and
our
doctrines
in
which
they
issue
through
the
exercise
of
abstraction
and
inference
this
is
obvious
but
it
does
not
interfere
with
holding
that
there
is
a
theological
habit
of
mind
and
a
religious
each
distinct
from
each
religion
using
theology
and
theology
using
religion
this
being
understood
i
propose
to
consider
the
dogmas
of
the
being
of
a
god
and
of
the
divine
trinity
in
unity
in
their
relation
to
assent
both
notional
and
real
and
principally
to
real
assent
i
have
not
yet
finished
all
i
have
to
say
by
way
of
introduction
now
first
my
subject
is
assent
and
not
inference
i
am
not
proposing
to
set
forth
the
arguments
which
issue
in
the
belief
of
these
doctrines
but
to
investigate
what
it
is
to
believe
in
them
what
the
mind
does
what
it
contemplates
when
it
makes
an
act
of
faith
it
is
true
that
the
same
elementary
facts
which
create
an
object
for
an
assent
also
furnish
matter
for
an
inference
and
in
showing
what
we
believe
i
shall
unavoidably
be
in
a
measure
showing
why
we
believe
but
this
is
the
very
reason
that
makes
it
necessary
for
me
at
the
outset
to
insist
on
the
real
distinction
between
these
two
concurring
and
coincident
courses
of
thought
and
to
premise
by
way
of
caution
lest
i
should
be
misunderstood
that
i
am
not
considering
the
question
that
there
is
a
god
but
rather
what
god
is
and
secondly
i
mean
by
belief
not
precisely
faith
because
faith
in
its
theological
sense
includes
a
belief
not
only
in
the
thing
believed
but
also
in
the
ground
of
believing
that
is
not
only
belief
in
certain
doctrines
but
belief
in
them
expressly
because
god
has
revealed
them
but
here
i
am
engaged
only
with
what
is
called
the
material
object
of
faith
not
with
the
formal
the
thing
believed
the
almighty
witnesses
to
himself
in
revelation
we
believe
that
he
is
one
and
that
he
is
three
because
he
says
so
we
believe
also
what
he
tells
us
about
his
attributes
his
providences
and
dispensations
his
determinations
and
acts
what
he
has
done
and
what
he
will
do
and
if
all
this
is
too
much
for
us
whether
to
bring
before
our
minds
at
one
time
from
its
variety
or
even
to
apprehend
at
all
or
enunciate
from
our
narrowness
of
intellect
or
want
of
learning
then
at
least
we
believe
all
that
he
has
revealed
to
us
about
himself
and
that
because
he
has
revealed
it
however
this
because
he
says
it
does
not
enter
into
the
scope
of
the
present
inquiry
but
only
the
truths
themselves
and
these
particular
truths
he
is
one
he
is
three
and
of
these
two
both
of
which
are
in
revelation
i
shall
consider
he
is
one
not
as
a
revealed
truth
but
as
what
it
is
also
a
natural
truth
the
foundation
of
all
religion
and
with
it
i
begin
belief
in
one
god
there
is
one
god
such
and
such
in
nature
and
attributes
i
say
such
and
such
for
unless
i
explain
what
i
mean
by
one
god
i
use
words
which
may
mean
any
thing
or
nothing
i
may
mean
a
mere
or
an
initial
principle
which
once
was
in
action
and
now
is
not
or
collective
humanity
i
speak
then
of
the
god
of
the
theist
and
of
the
christian
a
god
who
is
numerically
one
who
is
personal
the
author
sustainer
and
finisher
of
all
things
the
life
of
law
and
order
the
moral
governor
one
who
is
supreme
and
sole
like
himself
unlike
all
things
besides
himself
which
all
are
but
his
creatures
distinct
from
independent
of
them
all
one
who
is
absolutely
infinite
who
has
ever
been
and
ever
will
be
to
whom
nothing
is
past
or
future
who
is
all
perfection
and
the
fulness
and
archetype
of
every
possible
excellence
the
truth
itself
wisdom
love
justice
holiness
one
who
is
omnipresent
incomprehensible
these
are
some
of
the
distinctive
prerogatives
which
i
ascribe
unconditionally
and
unreservedly
to
the
great
being
whom
i
call
god
this
being
what
theists
mean
when
they
speak
of
god
their
assent
to
this
truth
admits
without
difficulty
of
being
what
i
have
called
a
notional
assent
it
is
an
assent
following
upon
acts
of
inference
and
other
purely
intellectual
exercises
and
it
is
an
assent
to
a
large
development
of
predicates
correlative
to
each
other
or
at
least
intimately
connected
together
drawn
out
as
if
on
paper
as
we
might
map
a
country
which
we
had
never
seen
or
construct
mathematical
tables
or
master
the
methods
of
discovery
of
newton
or
davy
without
being
geographers
mathematicians
or
chemists
ourselves
so
far
is
clear
but
the
question
follows
can
i
attain
to
any
more
vivid
assent
to
the
being
of
a
god
than
that
which
is
given
merely
to
notions
of
the
intellect
can
i
enter
with
a
personal
knowledge
into
the
circle
of
truths
which
make
up
that
great
thought
can
i
rise
to
what
i
have
called
an
imaginative
apprehension
of
it
can
i
believe
as
if
i
saw
since
such
a
high
assent
requires
a
present
experience
or
memory
of
the
fact
at
first
sight
it
would
seem
as
if
the
answer
must
be
in
the
negative
for
how
can
i
assent
as
if
i
saw
unless
i
have
seen
but
no
one
in
this
life
can
see
god
yet
i
conceive
a
real
assent
is
possible
and
i
proceed
to
show
how
when
it
is
said
that
we
can
not
see
god
this
is
undeniable
but
in
what
sense
have
we
a
discernment
of
his
creatures
of
the
individual
beings
which
surround
us
the
evidence
which
we
have
of
their
presence
lies
in
the
phenomena
which
address
our
senses
and
our
warrant
for
taking
these
for
evidence
is
our
instinctive
certitude
that
they
are
evidence
by
the
law
of
our
nature
we
associate
those
sensible
phenomena
or
impressions
with
certain
units
individuals
substances
whatever
they
are
to
be
called
which
are
outside
and
out
of
the
reach
of
sense
and
we
picture
them
to
ourselves
in
those
phenomena
the
phenomena
are
as
if
pictures
but
at
the
same
time
they
give
us
no
exact
measure
or
character
of
the
unknown
things
beyond
them
who
will
say
there
is
any
uniformity
between
the
impressions
which
two
of
us
would
respectively
have
of
some
third
thing
supposing
one
of
us
had
only
the
sense
of
touch
and
the
other
only
the
sense
of
hearing
therefore
when
we
speak
of
our
having
a
picture
of
the
things
which
are
perceived
through
the
senses
we
mean
a
certain
representation
true
as
far
as
it
goes
but
not
adequate
and
so
of
those
intellectual
and
moral
objects
which
are
brought
home
to
us
through
our
senses
they
exist
we
know
by
instinct
that
they
are
such
and
such
we
apprehend
from
the
impressions
which
they
leave
upon
our
minds
thus
the
life
and
writings
of
cicero
or
johnson
of
jerome
or
chrysostom
leave
upon
us
certain
impressions
of
the
intellectual
and
moral
character
of
each
of
them
and
unmistakable
we
take
up
a
passage
of
chrysostom
or
a
passage
of
jerome
there
is
no
possibility
of
confusing
the
one
with
the
other
in
each
case
we
see
the
man
in
his
language
and
so
of
any
great
man
whom
we
may
have
known
that
he
is
not
a
mere
impression
on
our
senses
but
a
real
being
we
know
by
instinct
that
he
is
such
and
such
we
know
by
the
matter
or
quality
of
that
impression
now
certainly
the
thought
of
god
as
theists
entertain
it
is
not
gained
by
an
instinctive
association
of
his
presence
with
any
sensible
phenomena
but
the
office
which
the
senses
directly
fulfil
as
regards
creation
that
devolves
indirectly
on
certain
of
our
mental
phenomena
as
regards
the
creator
those
phenomena
are
found
in
the
sense
of
moral
obligation
as
from
a
multitude
of
instinctive
perceptions
acting
in
particular
instances
of
something
beyond
the
senses
we
generalize
the
notion
of
an
external
world
and
then
picture
that
world
in
and
according
to
those
particular
phenomena
from
which
we
started
so
from
the
perceptive
power
which
identifies
the
intimations
of
conscience
with
the
reverberations
or
echoes
so
to
say
of
an
external
admonition
we
proceed
on
to
the
notion
of
a
supreme
ruler
and
judge
and
then
again
we
image
him
and
his
attributes
in
those
recurring
intimations
out
of
which
as
mental
phenomena
our
recognition
of
his
existence
was
originally
gained
and
if
the
impressions
which
his
creatures
make
on
us
through
our
senses
oblige
us
to
regard
those
creatures
as
respectively
it
is
not
wonderful
that
the
notices
which
he
indirectly
gives
us
through
our
conscience
of
his
own
nature
are
such
as
to
make
us
understand
that
he
is
like
himself
and
like
nothing
else
i
have
already
said
i
am
not
proposing
here
to
prove
the
being
of
a
god
yet
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
avoid
saying
where
i
look
for
the
proof
of
it
for
i
am
looking
for
that
proof
in
the
same
quarter
as
that
from
which
i
would
commence
a
proof
of
his
attributes
and
character
the
same
means
as
those
by
which
i
show
how
we
apprehend
him
not
merely
as
a
notion
but
as
a
reality
the
last
indeed
of
these
three
investigations
alone
concerns
me
here
but
i
can
not
altogether
exclude
the
two
former
from
my
consideration
however
i
repeat
what
i
am
directly
aiming
at
is
to
explain
how
we
gain
an
image
of
god
and
give
a
real
assent
to
the
proposition
that
he
exists
and
next
in
order
to
do
this
of
course
i
must
start
from
some
first
principle
that
first
principle
which
i
assume
and
shall
not
attempt
to
prove
is
that
which
i
should
also
use
as
a
foundation
in
those
other
two
inquiries
viz
that
we
have
by
nature
a
conscience
i
assume
then
that
conscience
has
a
legitimate
place
among
our
mental
acts
as
really
so
as
the
action
of
memory
of
reasoning
of
imagination
or
as
the
sense
of
the
beautiful
that
as
there
are
objects
which
when
presented
to
the
mind
cause
it
to
feel
grief
regret
joy
or
desire
so
there
are
things
which
excite
in
us
approbation
or
blame
and
which
we
in
consequence
call
right
or
wrong
and
which
experienced
in
ourselves
kindle
in
us
that
specific
sense
of
pleasure
or
pain
which
goes
by
the
name
of
a
good
or
bad
conscience
this
being
taken
for
granted
i
shall
attempt
to
show
that
in
this
special
feeling
which
follows
on
the
commission
of
what
we
call
right
or
wrong
lie
the
materials
for
the
real
apprehension
of
a
divine
sovereign
and
judge
the
feeling
of
conscience
being
i
repeat
a
certain
keen
sensibility
pleasant
or
painful
and
hope
or
compunction
and
fear
on
certain
of
our
actions
which
in
consequence
we
call
right
or
wrong
is
twofold
is
a
moral
sense
and
a
sense
of
duty
a
judgment
of
the
reason
and
a
magisterial
dictate
of
course
its
act
is
indivisible
still
it
has
these
two
aspects
distinct
from
each
other
and
admitting
of
a
separate
consideration
though
i
lost
my
sense
of
the
obligation
which
i
lie
under
to
abstain
from
acts
of
dishonesty
i
should
not
in
consequence
lose
my
sense
that
such
actions
were
an
outrage
offered
to
my
moral
nature
again
though
i
lost
my
sense
of
their
moral
deformity
i
should
not
therefore
lose
my
sense
that
they
were
forbidden
to
me
thus
conscience
has
both
a
critical
and
a
judicial
office
and
though
its
promptings
in
the
breasts
of
the
millions
of
human
beings
to
whom
it
is
given
are
not
in
all
cases
correct
that
does
not
necessarily
interfere
with
the
force
of
its
testimony
and
of
its
sanction
its
testimony
that
there
is
a
right
and
a
wrong
and
its
sanction
to
that
testimony
conveyed
in
the
feelings
which
attend
on
right
or
wrong
conduct
here
i
have
to
speak
of
conscience
in
the
latter
point
of
view
not
as
supplying
us
by
means
of
its
various
acts
with
the
elements
of
morals
such
as
may
be
developed
by
the
intellect
into
an
ethical
code
but
simply
as
the
dictate
of
an
authoritative
monitor
bearing
upon
the
details
of
conduct
as
they
come
before
us
and
complete
in
its
several
acts
one
by
one
let
us
then
thus
consider
conscience
not
as
a
rule
of
right
conduct
but
as
a
sanction
of
right
conduct
this
is
its
primary
and
most
authoritative
aspect
it
is
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
half
the
world
would
be
puzzled
to
know
what
was
meant
by
the
moral
sense
but
every
one
knows
what
is
meant
by
a
good
or
bad
conscience
conscience
is
ever
forcing
on
us
by
threats
and
by
promises
that
we
must
follow
the
right
and
avoid
the
wrong
so
far
it
is
one
and
the
same
in
the
mind
of
every
one
whatever
be
its
particular
errors
in
particular
minds
as
to
the
acts
which
it
orders
to
be
done
or
to
be
avoided
and
in
this
respect
it
corresponds
to
our
perception
of
the
beautiful
and
deformed
as
we
have
naturally
a
sense
of
the
beautiful
and
graceful
in
nature
and
art
though
tastes
proverbially
differ
so
we
have
a
sense
of
duty
and
obligation
whether
we
all
associate
it
with
the
same
certain
actions
in
particular
or
not
here
however
taste
and
conscience
part
company
for
the
sense
of
beautifulness
as
indeed
the
moral
sense
has
no
special
relations
to
persons
but
contemplates
objects
in
themselves
conscience
on
the
other
hand
is
concerned
with
persons
primarily
and
with
actions
mainly
as
viewed
in
their
doers
or
rather
with
self
alone
and
one
s
own
actions
and
with
others
only
indirectly
and
as
if
in
association
with
self
and
further
taste
is
its
own
evidence
appealing
to
nothing
beyond
its
own
sense
of
the
beautiful
or
the
ugly
and
enjoying
the
specimens
of
the
beautiful
simply
for
their
own
sake
but
conscience
does
not
repose
on
itself
but
vaguely
reaches
forward
to
something
beyond
self
and
dimly
discerns
a
sanction
higher
than
self
for
its
decisions
as
is
evidenced
in
that
keen
sense
of
obligation
and
responsibility
which
informs
them
and
hence
it
is
that
we
are
accustomed
to
speak
of
conscience
as
a
voice
term
which
we
should
never
think
of
applying
to
the
sense
of
the
beautiful
and
moreover
a
voice
or
the
echo
of
a
voice
imperative
and
constraining
like
no
other
dictate
in
the
whole
of
our
experience
and
again
in
consequence
of
this
prerogative
of
dictating
and
commanding
which
is
of
its
essence
conscience
has
an
intimate
bearing
on
our
affections
and
emotions
leading
us
to
reverence
and
awe
hope
and
fear
especially
fear
a
feeling
which
is
foreign
for
the
most
part
not
only
to
taste
but
even
to
the
moral
sense
except
in
consequence
of
accidental
associations
no
fear
is
felt
by
any
one
who
recognizes
that
his
conduct
has
not
been
beautiful
though
he
may
be
mortified
at
himself
if
perhaps
he
has
thereby
forfeited
some
advantage
but
if
he
has
been
betrayed
into
any
kind
of
immorality
he
has
a
lively
sense
of
responsibility
and
guilt
though
the
act
be
no
offence
against
society
distress
and
apprehension
even
though
it
may
be
of
present
service
to
him
compunction
and
regret
though
in
itself
it
be
most
pleasurable
confusion
of
face
though
it
may
have
no
witnesses
these
various
perturbations
of
mind
which
are
characteristic
of
a
bad
conscience
and
may
be
very
considerable
poignant
shame
haunting
remorse
chill
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
the
future
their
contraries
when
the
conscience
is
good
as
real
though
less
forcible
inward
peace
lightness
of
heart
and
the
like
emotions
constitute
a
specific
difference
between
conscience
and
our
other
intellectual
senses
sense
good
sense
sense
of
expedience
taste
sense
of
honour
and
the
like
indeed
they
would
also
constitute
between
conscience
and
the
moral
sense
supposing
these
two
were
not
aspects
of
one
and
the
same
feeling
exercised
upon
one
and
the
same
so
much
for
the
characteristic
phenomena
which
conscience
presents
nor
is
it
difficult
to
determine
what
they
imply
i
refer
once
more
to
our
sense
of
the
beautiful
this
sense
is
attended
by
an
intellectual
enjoyment
and
is
free
from
whatever
is
of
the
nature
of
emotion
except
in
one
case
viz
when
it
is
excited
by
personal
objects
then
it
is
that
the
tranquil
feeling
of
admiration
is
exchanged
for
the
excitement
of
affection
and
passion
conscience
too
considered
as
a
moral
sense
an
intellectual
sentiment
is
a
sense
of
admiration
and
disgust
of
approbation
and
blame
but
it
is
something
more
than
a
moral
sense
it
is
always
what
the
sense
of
the
beautiful
is
only
in
certain
cases
it
is
always
emotional
no
wonder
then
that
it
always
implies
what
that
sense
only
sometimes
implies
that
it
always
involves
the
recognition
of
a
living
object
towards
which
it
is
directed
inanimate
things
can
not
stir
our
affections
these
are
correlative
with
persons
if
as
is
the
case
we
feel
responsibility
are
ashamed
are
frightened
at
transgressing
the
voice
of
conscience
this
implies
that
there
is
one
to
whom
we
are
responsible
before
whom
we
are
ashamed
whose
claims
upon
us
we
fear
if
on
doing
wrong
we
feel
the
same
tearful
sorrow
which
overwhelms
us
on
hurting
a
mother
if
on
doing
right
we
enjoy
the
same
sunny
serenity
of
mind
the
same
soothing
satisfactory
delight
which
follows
on
our
receiving
praise
from
a
father
we
certainly
have
within
us
the
image
of
some
person
to
whom
our
love
and
veneration
look
in
whose
smile
we
find
our
happiness
for
whom
we
yearn
towards
whom
we
direct
our
pleadings
in
whose
anger
we
are
troubled
and
waste
away
these
feelings
in
us
are
such
as
require
for
their
exciting
cause
an
intelligent
being
we
are
not
affectionate
towards
a
stone
nor
do
we
feel
shame
before
a
horse
or
a
dog
we
have
no
remorse
or
compunction
on
breaking
mere
human
law
yet
so
it
is
conscience
excites
all
these
painful
emotions
confusion
foreboding
and
on
the
other
hand
it
sheds
upon
us
a
deep
peace
a
sense
of
security
a
resignation
and
a
hope
which
there
is
no
sensible
no
earthly
object
to
elicit
the
wicked
flees
when
no
one
pursueth
then
why
does
he
flee
whence
his
terror
who
is
it
that
he
sees
in
solitude
in
darkness
in
the
hidden
chambers
of
his
heart
if
the
cause
of
these
emotions
does
not
belong
to
this
visible
world
the
object
to
which
his
perception
is
directed
must
be
supernatural
and
divine
and
thus
the
phenomena
of
conscience
as
a
dictate
avail
to
impress
the
imagination
with
the
picture
of
a
supreme
governor
a
judge
holy
just
powerful
retributive
and
is
the
creative
principle
of
religion
as
the
moral
sense
is
the
principle
of
ethics
and
let
me
here
refer
again
to
the
fact
to
which
i
have
already
drawn
attention
that
this
instinct
of
the
mind
recognizing
an
external
master
in
the
dictate
of
conscience
and
imaging
the
thought
of
him
in
the
definite
impressions
which
conscience
creates
is
parallel
to
that
other
law
of
not
only
human
but
of
brute
nature
by
which
the
presence
of
unseen
individual
beings
is
discerned
under
the
shifting
shapes
and
colours
of
the
visible
world
is
it
by
sense
or
by
reason
that
brutes
understand
the
real
unities
material
and
spiritual
which
are
signified
by
the
lights
and
shadows
the
brilliant
calidoscope
as
it
may
be
called
which
plays
upon
their
not
by
reason
for
they
have
not
reason
not
by
sense
because
they
are
transcending
sense
therefore
it
is
an
instinct
this
faculty
on
the
part
of
brutes
unless
we
were
used
to
it
would
strike
us
as
a
great
mystery
it
is
one
peculiarity
of
animal
natures
to
be
susceptible
of
phenomena
through
the
channels
of
sense
it
is
another
to
have
in
those
sensible
phenomena
a
perception
of
the
individuals
to
which
this
or
that
group
of
them
belongs
this
perception
of
individual
things
amid
the
maze
of
shapes
and
colours
which
meets
their
sight
is
given
to
brutes
in
large
measures
and
that
apparently
from
the
moment
of
their
birth
it
is
by
no
mere
physical
instinct
such
as
that
which
leads
him
to
his
mother
for
milk
that
the
lamb
recognizes
each
of
his
fellow
lambkins
as
a
whole
consisting
of
many
parts
bound
up
in
one
and
before
he
is
an
hour
old
makes
experience
of
his
and
their
rival
individualities
and
much
more
distinctly
do
the
horse
and
dog
recognize
even
the
personality
of
their
masters
how
are
we
to
explain
this
apprehension
of
things
which
are
one
and
individual
in
the
midst
of
a
world
of
pluralities
and
transmutations
whether
in
the
instance
of
brutes
or
again
of
children
but
until
we
account
for
the
knowledge
which
an
infant
has
of
his
mother
or
his
nurse
what
reason
have
we
to
take
exception
at
the
doctrine
as
strange
and
difficult
that
in
the
dictate
of
conscience
without
previous
experiences
or
analogical
reasoning
he
is
able
gradually
to
perceive
the
voice
or
the
echoes
of
the
voice
of
a
master
living
personal
and
sovereign
i
grant
of
course
that
we
can
not
assign
a
date
ever
so
early
before
which
he
had
learned
nothing
at
all
and
formed
no
mental
associations
from
the
words
and
conduct
of
those
who
have
the
care
of
him
but
still
if
a
child
of
five
or
six
years
old
when
reason
is
at
length
fully
awake
has
already
mastered
and
appropriated
thoughts
and
beliefs
in
consequence
of
their
teaching
in
such
sort
as
to
be
able
to
handle
and
apply
them
familiarly
according
to
the
occasion
as
principles
of
intellectual
action
those
beliefs
at
the
very
least
must
be
singularly
congenial
to
his
mind
if
not
connatural
with
its
initial
action
and
that
such
a
spontaneous
reception
of
religious
truths
is
common
with
children
i
shall
take
for
granted
till
i
am
convinced
that
i
am
wrong
in
so
doing
the
child
keenly
understands
that
there
is
a
difference
between
right
and
wrong
and
when
he
has
done
what
he
believes
to
be
wrong
he
is
conscious
that
he
is
offending
one
to
whom
he
is
amenable
whom
he
does
not
see
who
sees
him
his
mind
reaches
forward
with
a
strong
presentiment
to
the
thought
of
a
moral
governor
sovereign
over
him
mindful
and
just
it
comes
to
him
like
an
impulse
of
nature
to
entertain
it
it
is
my
wish
to
take
an
ordinary
child
but
still
one
who
is
safe
from
influences
destructive
of
his
religious
instincts
supposing
he
has
offended
his
parents
he
will
all
alone
and
without
effort
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
of
acts
place
himself
in
the
presence
of
god
and
beg
of
him
to
set
him
right
with
them
let
us
consider
how
much
is
contained
in
this
simple
act
first
it
involves
the
impression
on
his
mind
of
an
unseen
being
with
whom
he
is
in
immediate
relation
and
that
relation
so
familiar
that
he
can
address
him
whenever
he
himself
chooses
next
of
one
whose
goodwill
towards
him
he
is
assured
of
and
can
take
for
who
loves
him
better
and
is
nearer
to
him
than
his
parents
further
of
one
who
can
hear
him
wherever
he
happens
to
be
and
who
can
read
his
thoughts
for
his
prayer
need
not
be
vocal
lastly
of
one
who
can
effect
a
critical
change
in
the
state
of
feeling
of
others
towards
him
that
is
we
shall
not
be
wrong
in
holding
that
this
child
has
in
his
mind
the
image
of
an
invisible
being
who
exercises
a
particular
providence
among
us
who
is
present
every
where
who
is
open
to
impetration
what
a
strong
and
intimate
vision
of
god
must
he
have
already
attained
if
as
i
have
supposed
an
ordinary
trouble
of
mind
has
the
spontaneous
effect
of
leading
him
for
consolation
and
aid
to
an
invisible
personal
power
moreover
this
image
brought
before
his
mental
vision
is
the
image
of
one
who
by
implicit
threat
and
promise
commands
certain
things
which
he
the
same
child
coincidently
by
the
same
act
of
his
mind
approves
which
receive
the
adhesion
of
his
moral
sense
and
judgment
as
right
and
good
it
is
the
image
of
one
who
is
good
inasmuch
as
enjoining
and
enforcing
what
is
right
and
good
and
who
in
consequence
not
only
excites
in
the
child
hope
and
fear
it
may
be
added
gratitude
towards
him
as
giving
a
law
and
maintaining
it
by
reward
and
punishment
kindles
in
him
love
towards
him
as
giving
him
a
good
law
and
therefore
as
being
good
himself
for
it
is
the
property
of
goodness
to
kindle
love
or
rather
the
very
object
of
love
is
goodness
and
all
those
distinct
elements
of
the
moral
law
which
the
typical
child
whom
i
am
supposing
more
or
less
consciously
loves
and
approves
purity
justice
kindness
and
the
like
but
shapes
and
aspects
of
goodness
and
having
in
his
degree
a
sensibility
towards
them
all
for
the
sake
of
them
all
he
is
moved
to
love
the
lawgiver
who
enjoins
them
upon
him
and
as
he
can
contemplate
these
qualities
and
their
manifestations
under
the
common
name
of
goodness
he
is
prepared
to
think
of
them
as
indivisible
correlative
supplementary
of
each
other
in
one
and
the
same
personality
so
that
there
is
no
aspect
of
goodness
which
god
is
not
and
that
the
more
because
the
notion
of
a
perfection
embracing
all
possible
excellences
both
moral
and
intellectual
is
especially
congenial
to
the
mind
and
there
are
in
fact
intellectual
attributes
as
well
as
moral
included
in
the
child
s
image
of
god
as
above
represented
such
is
the
apprehension
which
even
a
child
may
have
of
his
sovereign
lawgiver
and
judge
which
is
possible
in
the
case
of
children
because
at
least
some
children
possess
it
whether
others
possess
it
or
no
and
which
when
it
is
found
in
children
is
found
to
act
promptly
and
keenly
by
reason
of
the
paucity
of
their
ideas
it
is
an
image
of
the
good
god
good
in
himself
good
relatively
to
the
child
with
whatever
incompleteness
an
image
before
it
has
been
reflected
on
and
before
it
is
recognized
by
him
as
a
notion
though
he
can
not
explain
or
define
the
word
god
when
told
to
use
it
his
acts
show
that
to
him
it
is
far
more
than
a
word
he
listens
indeed
with
wonder
and
interest
to
fables
or
tales
he
has
a
dim
shadowy
sense
of
what
he
hears
about
persons
and
matters
of
this
world
but
he
has
that
within
him
which
actually
vibrates
responds
and
gives
a
deep
meaning
to
the
lessons
of
his
first
teachers
about
the
will
and
the
providence
of
god
how
far
this
initial
religious
knowledge
comes
from
without
and
how
far
from
within
how
much
is
natural
how
much
implies
a
special
divine
aid
which
is
above
nature
we
have
no
means
of
determining
nor
is
it
necessary
for
my
present
purpose
to
determine
i
am
not
engaged
in
tracing
the
image
of
god
in
the
mind
of
a
child
or
a
man
to
its
first
origins
but
showing
that
he
can
become
possessed
of
such
an
image
over
and
above
all
mere
notions
of
god
and
in
what
that
image
consists
whether
its
elements
latent
in
the
mind
would
ever
be
elicited
without
extrinsic
help
is
very
doubtful
but
whatever
be
the
actual
history
of
the
first
formation
of
the
divine
image
within
us
so
far
at
least
is
certain
that
by
informations
external
to
ourselves
as
time
goes
on
it
admits
of
being
strengthened
and
improved
it
is
certain
too
that
whether
it
grows
brighter
and
stronger
or
on
the
other
hand
is
dimmed
distorted
or
obliterated
depends
on
each
of
us
individually
and
on
his
circumstances
it
is
more
than
probable
that
in
the
event
from
neglect
from
the
temptations
of
life
from
bad
companions
or
from
the
urgency
of
secular
occupations
the
light
of
the
soul
will
fade
away
and
die
out
men
transgress
their
sense
of
duty
and
gradually
lose
those
sentiments
of
shame
and
fear
the
natural
supplements
of
transgression
which
as
i
have
said
are
the
witnesses
of
the
unseen
judge
and
even
were
it
deemed
impossible
that
those
who
had
in
their
first
youth
a
genuine
apprehension
of
him
could
ever
utterly
lose
it
yet
that
apprehension
may
become
almost
undistinguishable
from
an
inferential
acceptance
of
the
great
truth
or
may
dwindle
into
a
mere
notion
of
their
intellect
on
the
contrary
the
image
of
god
if
duly
cherished
may
expand
deepen
and
be
completed
with
the
growth
of
their
powers
and
in
the
course
of
life
under
the
varied
lessons
within
and
without
them
which
are
brought
home
to
them
concerning
that
same
god
one
and
personal
by
means
of
education
social
intercourse
experience
and
literature
to
a
mind
thus
carefully
formed
upon
the
basis
of
its
natural
conscience
the
world
both
of
nature
and
of
man
does
but
give
back
a
reflection
of
those
truths
about
the
one
living
god
which
have
been
familiar
to
it
from
childhood
good
and
evil
meet
us
daily
as
we
pass
through
life
and
there
are
those
who
think
it
philosophical
to
act
towards
the
manifestations
of
each
with
some
sort
of
impartiality
as
if
evil
had
as
much
right
to
be
there
as
good
or
even
a
better
as
having
more
striking
triumphs
and
a
broader
jurisdiction
and
because
the
course
of
things
is
determined
by
fixed
laws
they
consider
that
those
laws
preclude
the
present
agency
of
the
creator
in
the
carrying
out
of
particular
issues
it
is
otherwise
with
the
theology
of
a
religious
imagination
it
has
a
living
hold
on
truths
which
are
really
to
be
found
in
the
world
though
they
are
not
upon
the
surface
it
is
able
to
pronounce
by
anticipation
what
it
takes
a
long
argument
to
good
is
the
rule
and
evil
the
exception
it
is
able
to
assume
that
uniform
as
are
the
laws
of
nature
they
are
consistent
with
a
particular
providence
it
interprets
what
it
sees
around
it
by
this
previous
inward
teaching
as
the
true
key
of
that
maze
of
vast
complicated
disorder
and
thus
it
gains
a
more
and
more
consistent
and
luminous
vision
of
god
from
the
most
unpromising
materials
thus
conscience
is
a
connecting
principle
between
the
creature
and
his
creator
and
the
firmest
hold
of
theological
truths
is
gained
by
habits
of
personal
religion
when
men
begin
all
their
works
with
the
thought
of
god
acting
for
his
sake
and
to
fulfil
his
will
when
they
ask
his
blessing
on
themselves
and
their
life
pray
to
him
for
the
objects
they
desire
and
see
him
in
the
event
whether
it
be
according
to
their
prayers
or
not
they
will
find
every
thing
that
happens
tend
to
confirm
them
in
the
truth
about
him
which
live
in
their
imagination
varied
and
unearthly
as
those
truths
may
be
then
they
are
brought
into
his
presence
as
that
of
a
living
person
and
are
able
to
hold
converse
with
him
and
that
with
a
directness
and
simplicity
with
a
confidence
and
intimacy
which
we
use
towards
an
earthly
superior
so
that
it
is
doubtful
whether
we
realize
the
company
of
our
with
greater
keenness
than
these
favoured
minds
are
able
to
contemplate
and
adore
the
unseen
incomprehensible
creator
this
vivid
apprehension
of
religious
objects
on
which
i
have
been
enlarging
is
independent
of
the
written
records
of
revelation
it
does
not
require
any
knowledge
of
scripture
nor
of
the
history
or
the
teaching
of
the
catholic
church
it
is
independent
of
books
but
if
so
much
may
be
traced
out
in
the
twilight
of
natural
religion
it
is
obvious
how
great
an
addition
in
fulness
and
exactness
is
made
to
our
mental
image
of
the
divine
personality
and
attributes
by
the
light
of
christianity
and
indeed
to
give
us
a
clear
and
sufficient
object
for
our
faith
is
one
main
purpose
of
the
supernatural
dispensations
of
religion
this
purpose
is
carried
out
in
the
written
word
with
an
effectiveness
which
inspiration
alone
could
secure
first
by
the
histories
which
form
so
large
a
portion
of
the
old
testament
and
scarcely
less
impressively
in
the
prophetical
system
as
it
is
gradually
unfolded
and
perfected
in
the
writings
of
those
who
were
its
ministers
and
spokesmen
and
as
the
exercise
of
the
affections
strengthens
our
apprehension
of
the
object
of
them
it
is
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
influence
exerted
on
the
religious
imagination
by
a
book
of
devotions
so
sublime
so
penetrating
so
full
of
deep
instruction
as
the
psalter
to
say
nothing
of
other
portions
of
the
hagiographa
and
then
as
regards
the
new
testament
the
gospels
from
their
subject
contain
a
manifestation
of
the
divine
nature
so
special
as
to
make
it
appear
from
the
contrast
as
if
nothing
were
known
of
god
when
they
are
unknown
lastly
the
apostolic
epistles
the
long
history
of
the
church
with
its
fresh
exhibitions
of
divine
agency
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
the
reasonings
internal
collisions
and
decisions
of
the
theological
school
form
an
extended
comment
on
the
words
and
works
of
our
lord
i
think
i
need
not
say
more
in
illustration
of
the
subject
which
i
proposed
for
consideration
in
this
section
i
have
wished
to
trace
the
process
by
which
the
mind
arrives
not
only
at
a
notional
but
at
an
imaginative
or
real
assent
to
the
doctrine
that
there
is
one
god
that
is
an
assent
made
with
an
apprehension
not
only
of
what
the
words
of
the
proposition
mean
but
of
the
object
denoted
by
them
without
a
proposition
or
thesis
there
can
be
no
assent
no
belief
at
all
any
more
than
there
can
be
an
inference
without
a
conclusion
the
proposition
that
there
is
one
personal
and
present
god
may
be
held
in
either
way
either
as
a
theological
truth
or
as
a
religious
fact
or
reality
the
notion
and
the
reality
are
represented
by
one
and
the
same
proposition
but
serve
as
distinct
interpretations
of
it
when
the
proposition
is
apprehended
for
the
purposes
of
proof
analysis
comparison
and
the
like
intellectual
exercises
it
is
used
as
the
expression
of
a
notion
when
for
the
purposes
of
devotion
it
is
the
image
of
a
reality
theology
properly
and
directly
deals
with
notional
apprehension
religion
with
imaginative
here
we
have
the
solution
of
the
common
mistake
of
supposing
that
there
is
a
contrariety
and
antagonism
between
a
dogmatic
creed
and
vital
religion
people
urge
that
salvation
consists
not
in
believing
the
propositions
that
there
is
a
god
that
there
is
a
saviour
that
our
lord
is
god
that
there
is
a
trinity
but
in
believing
in
god
in
a
saviour
in
a
sanctifier
and
they
object
that
such
propositions
are
but
a
formal
and
human
medium
destroying
all
true
reception
of
the
gospel
and
making
religion
a
matter
of
words
or
of
logic
instead
of
its
having
its
seat
in
the
heart
they
are
right
so
far
as
this
that
men
can
and
sometimes
do
rest
in
the
propositions
themselves
as
expressing
intellectual
notions
they
are
wrong
when
they
maintain
that
men
need
do
so
or
always
do
so
the
propositions
may
and
must
be
used
and
can
easily
be
used
as
the
expression
of
facts
not
notions
and
they
are
necessary
to
the
mind
in
the
same
way
that
language
is
ever
necessary
for
denoting
facts
both
for
ourselves
as
individuals
and
for
our
intercourse
with
others
again
they
are
useful
in
their
dogmatic
aspect
as
ascertaining
and
making
clear
for
us
the
truths
on
which
the
religious
imagination
has
to
rest
knowledge
must
ever
precede
the
exercise
of
the
affections
we
feel
gratitude
and
love
we
feel
indignation
and
dislike
when
we
have
the
informations
actually
put
before
us
which
are
to
kindle
those
several
emotions
we
love
our
parents
as
our
parents
when
we
know
them
to
be
our
parents
we
must
know
concerning
god
before
we
can
feel
love
fear
hope
or
trust
towards
him
devotion
must
have
its
objects
those
objects
as
being
supernatural
when
not
represented
to
our
senses
by
material
symbols
must
be
set
before
the
mind
in
propositions
the
formula
which
embodies
a
dogma
for
the
theologian
readily
suggests
an
object
for
the
worshipper
it
seems
a
truism
to
say
yet
it
is
all
that
i
have
been
saying
that
in
religion
the
imagination
and
affections
should
always
be
under
the
control
of
reason
theology
may
stand
as
a
substantive
science
though
it
be
without
the
life
of
religion
but
religion
can
not
maintain
its
ground
at
all
without
theology
sentiment
whether
imaginative
or
emotional
falls
back
upon
the
intellect
for
its
stay
when
sense
can
not
be
called
into
exercise
and
it
is
in
this
way
that
devotion
falls
back
upon
dogma
belief
in
the
holy
trinity
of
course
i
can
not
hope
to
carry
all
inquiring
minds
with
me
in
what
i
have
been
laying
down
in
the
foregoing
section
i
have
appealed
to
the
testimony
given
implicitly
by
our
conscience
to
the
divine
being
and
his
attributes
and
there
are
those
i
know
whose
experience
will
not
respond
to
the
appeal
but
are
there
any
truths
which
have
reality
whether
of
experience
or
of
reason
which
are
not
disputed
by
some
schools
of
philosophy
or
some
bodies
of
men
if
we
assume
nothing
but
what
has
universal
reception
the
field
of
our
possible
discussions
will
suffer
much
contraction
so
that
it
must
be
considered
sufficient
in
any
inquiry
if
the
principles
or
facts
assumed
have
a
large
following
this
condition
is
abundantly
fulfilled
as
regards
the
authority
and
religious
meaning
of
conscience
conscience
is
the
voice
of
god
has
almost
grown
into
a
proverb
this
solemn
dogma
is
recognized
as
such
by
the
great
mass
both
of
the
young
and
of
the
uneducated
by
the
religious
few
and
the
irreligious
many
it
is
proclaimed
in
the
history
and
literature
of
nations
it
has
had
supporters
in
all
ages
places
creeds
forms
of
social
life
professions
and
classes
it
has
held
its
ground
under
great
intellectual
and
moral
disadvantages
it
has
recovered
its
supremacy
and
ultimately
triumphed
in
the
minds
of
those
who
had
rebelled
against
it
even
philosophers
who
have
been
antagonists
on
other
points
agree
in
recognizing
the
inward
voice
of
that
solemn
monitor
personal
peremptory
unargumentative
irresponsible
minatory
definitive
this
i
consider
relieves
me
of
the
necessity
of
arguing
with
those
who
would
resolve
our
sense
of
right
and
wrong
into
a
sense
of
the
expedient
or
the
beautiful
or
would
refer
its
authoritative
suggestions
to
the
effect
of
teaching
or
of
association
there
are
those
who
can
see
and
hear
for
all
the
common
purposes
of
life
yet
have
no
eye
for
colours
or
their
shades
or
no
ear
for
music
moreover
there
are
degrees
of
sensibility
to
colours
and
to
sounds
in
the
comparison
of
man
with
man
while
some
men
are
or
again
all
men
as
time
goes
on
have
the
prospect
of
losing
that
keenness
of
sight
and
hearing
which
they
possessed
in
their
youth
and
so
in
like
manner
we
may
lose
in
manhood
and
in
age
that
sense
of
a
supreme
teacher
and
judge
which
was
the
gift
of
our
first
years
and
that
the
more
because
in
most
men
the
imagination
suffers
from
the
lapse
of
time
and
the
experience
of
life
long
before
the
bodily
senses
fail
and
this
accords
with
the
advice
of
the
sacred
writer
to
remember
our
creator
in
the
days
of
our
youth
while
our
moral
sensibilities
are
fresh
before
the
sun
and
the
light
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
be
darkened
and
the
clouds
return
after
the
accordingly
if
there
be
those
who
deny
that
the
dictate
of
conscience
is
ever
more
than
a
taste
or
an
association
it
is
a
less
difficulty
to
me
to
believe
that
they
are
deficient
either
in
the
religious
sense
or
in
their
memory
of
early
years
than
that
they
never
had
at
all
what
those
around
them
without
hesitation
profess
to
have
received
from
nature
so
much
on
the
doctrine
of
the
being
and
attributes
of
god
and
of
the
real
apprehension
with
which
we
can
contemplate
and
assent
to
it
i
turn
to
the
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
with
the
purpose
of
investigating
in
like
manner
how
far
it
belongs
to
theology
how
far
to
the
faith
and
devotion
of
the
individual
how
far
the
propositions
enunciating
it
are
confined
to
the
expression
of
intellectual
notions
and
how
far
they
stand
for
things
also
and
admit
of
that
assent
which
we
give
to
objects
presented
to
us
by
the
imagination
and
first
i
have
to
state
what
our
doctrine
is
no
one
is
to
be
called
a
theist
who
does
not
believe
in
a
personal
god
whatever
difficulty
there
may
be
in
defining
the
word
now
it
is
the
belief
of
catholics
about
the
supreme
being
that
this
essential
characteristic
of
his
nature
is
reiterated
in
three
distinct
ways
or
modes
so
that
the
almighty
god
instead
of
being
one
person
only
which
is
the
teaching
of
natural
religion
has
three
personalities
and
is
at
once
according
as
we
view
him
in
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
the
father
the
son
and
the
divine
three
who
bear
towards
each
other
the
several
relations
which
those
names
indicate
and
are
in
that
respect
distinct
from
each
other
and
in
that
alone
this
is
the
teaching
of
the
athanasian
creed
viz
that
the
one
personal
god
who
is
not
a
logical
or
physical
unity
but
a
living
more
really
one
even
than
an
individual
man
is
unus
not
unum
because
of
the
inseparability
of
his
nature
and
personality
at
once
is
father
is
son
is
holy
ghost
each
of
whom
is
that
one
personal
god
in
the
fulness
of
his
being
and
attributes
so
that
the
father
is
all
that
is
meant
by
the
word
god
as
if
we
knew
nothing
of
son
or
of
spirit
and
in
like
manner
the
son
and
the
spirit
are
each
by
himself
all
that
is
meant
by
the
word
as
if
the
other
two
were
unknown
moreover
that
by
the
word
god
is
meant
nothing
over
and
above
what
is
meant
by
the
father
or
by
the
son
or
by
the
holy
ghost
and
that
the
father
is
in
no
sense
the
son
nor
the
son
the
holy
ghost
nor
the
holy
ghost
the
father
such
is
the
prerogative
of
the
divine
infinitude
that
that
one
and
single
personal
being
the
almighty
god
is
really
three
while
he
is
absolutely
one
indeed
the
catholic
dogma
may
be
said
to
be
summed
up
in
this
very
formula
on
which
augustine
lays
so
much
stress
tres
et
unus
not
merely
unum
hence
that
formula
is
the
as
it
may
be
called
of
the
athanasian
creed
in
that
creed
we
testify
to
the
unus
increatus
to
the
unus
immensus
omnipotens
deus
and
dominus
yet
each
of
the
three
also
is
by
himself
increatus
immensus
omnipotens
for
each
is
that
one
god
though
each
is
not
the
other
each
as
is
intimated
by
unus
increatus
is
the
one
personal
god
of
natural
religion
that
this
doctrine
thus
drawn
out
is
of
a
notional
character
is
plain
the
question
before
me
is
whether
in
any
sense
it
can
become
the
object
of
real
apprehension
that
is
whether
any
portion
of
it
may
be
considered
as
addressed
to
the
imagination
and
is
able
to
exert
that
living
mastery
over
the
mind
which
is
instanced
as
i
have
shown
above
as
regards
the
proposition
there
is
a
there
is
a
god
when
really
apprehended
is
the
object
of
a
strong
energetic
adhesion
which
works
a
revolution
in
the
mind
but
when
held
merely
as
a
notion
it
requires
but
a
cold
and
ineffective
acceptance
though
it
be
held
ever
so
unconditionally
such
in
its
character
is
the
assent
of
thousands
whose
imaginations
are
not
at
all
kindled
nor
their
hearts
inflamed
nor
their
conduct
affected
by
the
most
august
of
all
conceivable
truths
i
ask
then
as
concerns
the
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
such
as
i
have
drawn
it
out
to
be
is
it
capable
of
being
apprehended
otherwise
than
notionally
is
it
a
theory
undeniable
indeed
but
addressed
to
the
student
and
to
no
one
else
is
it
the
elaborate
subtle
triumphant
exhibition
of
a
truth
completely
developed
and
happily
adjusted
and
accurately
balanced
on
its
centre
and
impregnable
on
every
side
as
a
scientific
view
totus
teres
atque
rotundus
challenging
all
assailants
or
on
the
other
hand
does
it
come
to
the
unlearned
the
young
the
busy
and
the
afflicted
as
a
fact
which
is
to
arrest
them
penetrate
them
and
to
support
and
animate
them
in
their
passage
through
life
that
is
does
it
admit
of
being
held
in
the
imagination
and
being
embraced
with
a
real
assent
i
maintain
it
does
and
that
it
is
the
normal
faith
which
every
christian
has
on
which
he
is
stayed
which
is
his
spiritual
life
there
being
nothing
in
the
exposition
of
the
dogma
as
i
have
given
it
above
which
does
not
address
the
imagination
as
well
as
the
intellect
now
let
us
observe
what
is
not
in
that
exposition
are
no
scientific
terms
in
it
i
will
not
allow
that
personal
is
such
because
it
is
a
word
in
common
use
and
though
it
can
not
mean
precisely
the
same
when
used
of
god
as
when
it
is
used
of
man
yet
it
is
sufficiently
explained
by
that
common
use
to
allow
of
its
being
intelligibly
applied
to
the
divine
nature
the
other
words
which
occur
in
the
above
account
of
the
doctrine
one
he
god
father
son
spirit
none
of
them
words
peculiar
to
theology
have
all
a
popular
meaning
and
are
used
according
to
that
obvious
and
popular
meaning
when
introduced
into
the
catholic
dogma
no
human
words
indeed
are
worthy
of
the
supreme
being
none
are
adequate
but
we
have
no
other
words
to
use
but
human
and
those
in
question
are
among
the
simplest
and
most
intelligible
that
are
to
be
found
in
language
there
are
then
no
terms
in
the
foregoing
exposition
which
do
not
admit
of
a
plain
sense
and
they
are
there
used
in
that
sense
and
moreover
that
sense
is
what
i
have
called
real
for
the
words
in
their
ordinary
use
stand
for
things
the
words
father
son
spirit
he
one
and
the
rest
are
not
abstract
terms
but
concrete
and
adapted
to
excite
images
and
these
words
thus
simple
and
clear
are
embodied
in
simple
clear
brief
categorical
propositions
there
is
nothing
abstruse
either
in
the
terms
themselves
or
in
their
setting
it
is
otherwise
of
course
with
formal
theological
treatises
on
the
subject
of
the
dogma
there
we
find
such
words
as
substance
essence
existence
form
subsistence
notion
circumincession
and
though
these
are
far
easier
to
understand
than
might
at
first
sight
be
thought
still
they
are
doubtless
addressed
to
the
intellect
and
can
only
command
a
notional
assent
it
will
be
observed
also
that
not
even
the
words
mysteriousness
and
mystery
occur
in
the
exposition
which
i
have
above
given
of
the
doctrine
i
omitted
them
because
they
are
not
parts
of
the
divine
verity
as
such
but
in
relation
to
creatures
and
to
the
human
intellect
and
because
they
are
of
a
notional
character
it
is
plain
of
course
even
at
first
sight
that
the
doctrine
is
an
inscrutable
mystery
or
has
an
inscrutable
mysteriousness
few
minds
indeed
but
have
theology
enough
to
see
this
and
if
an
educated
man
to
whom
it
is
presented
does
not
perceive
that
mysteriousness
at
once
that
is
a
sure
token
that
he
does
not
rightly
apprehend
the
propositions
which
contain
the
doctrine
hence
it
follows
that
the
thesis
the
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
in
unity
is
mysterious
is
indirectly
an
article
of
faith
but
such
an
article
being
a
reflection
made
upon
a
revealed
truth
in
an
inference
expresses
a
notion
not
a
thing
it
does
not
relate
to
the
direct
apprehension
of
the
object
but
to
a
judgment
of
our
reason
upon
the
object
accordingly
the
mysteriousness
of
the
doctrine
is
not
strictly
speaking
intrinsical
to
it
as
it
is
proposed
to
the
religious
apprehension
though
in
matter
of
fact
a
devotional
mind
on
perceiving
that
mysteriousness
will
lovingly
appropriate
it
as
involved
in
the
divine
revelation
and
as
such
a
mind
turns
all
thoughts
which
come
before
it
to
a
sacred
use
so
will
it
dwell
upon
the
mystery
of
the
trinity
with
awe
and
veneration
as
a
truth
befitting
so
to
say
the
immensity
and
incomprehensibility
of
the
supreme
being
however
i
do
not
put
forward
the
mystery
as
the
direct
object
of
real
or
religious
apprehension
nor
again
the
complex
doctrine
when
it
is
viewed
modum
as
one
whole
in
which
the
mystery
lies
let
it
be
observed
it
is
possible
for
the
mind
to
hold
a
number
of
propositions
either
in
their
combination
as
one
whole
or
one
by
one
one
by
one
with
an
intelligent
perception
indeed
of
each
and
of
the
general
direction
of
each
towards
the
rest
yet
of
each
separately
from
the
rest
for
its
own
sake
only
and
not
in
connexion
and
one
with
the
rest
thus
i
may
know
london
quite
well
and
find
my
way
from
street
to
street
in
any
part
of
it
without
difficulty
yet
be
quite
unable
to
draw
a
map
of
it
comparison
calculation
cataloguing
arranging
classifying
are
intellectual
acts
subsequent
upon
and
not
necessary
for
a
real
apprehension
of
the
things
on
which
they
are
exercised
strictly
speaking
then
the
dogma
of
the
holy
trinity
as
a
complex
whole
or
as
a
mystery
is
not
the
formal
object
of
religious
apprehension
and
assent
but
as
a
number
of
propositions
taken
one
by
one
that
mystery
also
is
of
course
the
object
of
assent
but
it
is
the
notional
object
and
when
presented
to
religious
minds
it
is
received
by
them
notionally
and
again
implicitly
viz
in
the
real
assent
which
they
give
to
the
word
of
god
as
conveyed
to
them
through
the
instrumentality
of
his
church
on
these
points
it
may
be
right
to
enlarge
of
course
as
i
have
been
saying
a
man
of
ordinary
intelligence
will
be
at
once
struck
with
the
apparent
contrariety
between
the
propositions
one
with
another
which
constitute
the
heavenly
dogma
and
by
reason
of
his
spontaneous
activity
of
mind
and
by
an
habitual
association
he
will
be
compelled
to
view
the
dogma
in
the
light
of
that
contrariety
much
so
that
to
hold
one
and
all
of
these
separate
propositions
will
be
to
such
a
man
all
one
with
holding
the
mystery
as
a
mystery
and
in
consequence
he
will
so
hold
it
still
i
say
so
far
he
will
hold
it
only
with
a
notional
apprehension
he
will
accurately
take
in
the
meaning
of
each
of
the
dogmatic
propositions
in
its
relation
to
the
rest
of
them
combining
them
into
one
whole
and
embracing
what
he
can
not
realize
with
an
assent
notional
indeed
but
as
genuine
and
thorough
as
any
real
assent
can
be
but
the
question
is
whether
a
real
assent
to
the
mystery
as
such
is
possible
and
i
say
it
is
not
possible
because
while
we
can
image
the
separate
propositions
we
can
not
image
them
all
together
we
can
not
because
the
mystery
transcends
all
our
experience
we
have
no
experiences
in
our
memory
which
we
can
put
together
compare
contrast
unite
and
thereby
transmute
into
an
image
of
the
ineffable
verity
but
what
is
in
some
degree
a
matter
of
experience
what
is
presented
for
the
imagination
the
affections
the
devotion
the
spiritual
life
of
the
christian
to
repose
upon
with
a
real
assent
what
stands
for
things
not
for
notions
only
is
each
of
those
propositions
taken
one
by
one
and
that
not
in
the
case
of
intellectual
and
thoughtful
minds
only
but
of
all
religious
minds
whatever
in
the
case
of
a
child
or
a
peasant
as
well
as
of
a
philosopher
this
is
only
one
instance
of
a
general
principle
which
holds
good
in
all
such
real
apprehension
as
is
possible
to
us
of
god
and
his
attributes
not
only
do
we
see
him
at
best
only
in
shadows
but
we
can
not
bring
even
those
shadows
together
for
they
flit
to
and
fro
and
are
never
present
to
us
at
once
we
can
indeed
combine
the
various
matters
which
we
know
of
him
by
an
act
of
the
intellect
and
treat
them
theologically
but
such
theological
combinations
are
no
objects
for
the
imagination
to
gaze
upon
our
image
of
him
never
is
one
but
broken
into
numberless
partial
aspects
independent
each
of
each
as
we
can
not
see
the
whole
starry
firmament
at
once
but
have
to
turn
ourselves
from
east
to
west
and
then
round
to
east
again
sighting
first
one
constellation
and
then
another
and
losing
these
in
order
to
gain
those
so
it
is
and
much
more
with
such
real
apprehensions
as
we
can
secure
of
the
divine
nature
we
know
one
truth
about
him
and
another
truth
we
can
not
image
both
of
them
together
we
can
not
bring
them
before
us
by
one
act
of
the
mind
we
drop
the
one
while
we
turn
to
take
up
the
other
none
of
them
are
fully
dwelt
on
and
enjoyed
when
they
are
viewed
in
combination
moreover
our
devotion
is
tried
and
confused
by
the
long
list
of
propositions
which
theology
is
obliged
to
draw
up
by
the
limitations
explanations
definitions
adjustments
balancings
cautions
arbitrary
prohibitions
which
are
imperatively
required
by
the
weakness
of
human
thought
and
the
imperfections
of
human
language
such
exercises
of
reasoning
indeed
do
but
increase
and
harmonize
our
notional
apprehension
of
the
dogma
but
they
add
little
to
the
luminousness
and
vital
force
with
which
its
separate
propositions
come
home
to
our
imagination
and
if
they
are
necessary
as
they
certainly
are
they
are
necessary
not
so
much
for
faith
as
against
unbelief
break
a
ray
of
light
into
its
constituent
colours
each
is
beautiful
each
may
be
enjoyed
attempt
to
unite
them
and
perhaps
you
produce
only
a
dirty
white
the
pure
and
indivisible
light
is
seen
only
by
the
blessed
inhabitants
of
heaven
here
we
have
but
such
faint
reflections
of
it
as
its
diffraction
supplies
but
they
are
sufficient
for
faith
and
devotion
attempt
to
combine
them
into
one
and
you
gain
nothing
but
a
mystery
which
you
can
describe
as
a
notion
but
can
not
depict
as
an
imagination
and
this
which
holds
of
the
divine
attributes
holds
also
of
the
holy
trinity
in
unity
and
hence
perhaps
it
is
that
the
latter
doctrine
is
never
spoken
of
as
a
mystery
in
the
new
testament
which
is
addressed
far
more
to
the
imagination
and
affections
than
to
the
intellect
hence
too
what
is
more
remarkable
the
dogma
is
not
called
a
mystery
in
the
creeds
not
in
the
apostles
nor
the
nicene
nor
even
in
the
athanasian
the
reason
seems
to
be
that
the
creeds
have
a
place
in
the
ritual
they
are
devotional
acts
and
of
the
nature
of
prayers
addressed
to
god
and
in
such
addresses
to
speak
of
intellectual
difficulties
would
be
out
of
place
it
must
be
recollected
especially
that
the
athanasian
creed
has
sometimes
been
called
the
psalmus
it
is
not
a
mere
collection
of
notions
however
momentous
it
is
a
psalm
or
hymn
of
praise
of
confession
and
of
profound
homage
parallel
to
the
canticles
of
the
elect
in
the
apocalypse
it
appeals
to
the
imagination
quite
as
much
as
to
the
intellect
it
is
the
of
faith
with
which
we
warn
first
ourselves
then
each
other
and
then
all
those
who
are
within
its
hearing
and
the
hearing
of
the
truth
who
our
god
is
and
how
we
must
worship
him
and
how
vast
our
responsibility
will
be
if
we
know
what
to
believe
and
yet
believe
not
it
is
the
psalm
that
gathers
in
one
glorious
lay
all
chants
that
e
er
from
heaven
to
earth
found
way
creed
of
the
saints
and
anthem
of
the
blest
and
warning
of
the
kindliest
love
that
ever
heaved
a
wakeful
mother
s
for
myself
i
have
ever
felt
it
as
the
most
simple
and
sublime
the
most
devotional
formulary
to
which
christianity
has
given
birth
more
so
even
than
the
and
the
even
the
antithetical
form
of
its
sentences
which
is
a
to
so
many
as
seeming
to
force
and
to
exult
in
forcing
a
mystery
upon
recalcitrating
minds
has
to
my
apprehension
even
notionally
considered
a
very
different
drift
it
is
intended
as
a
check
upon
our
reasonings
lest
they
rush
on
in
one
direction
beyond
the
limits
of
the
truth
and
it
turns
them
back
into
the
opposite
direction
certainly
it
implies
a
glorying
in
the
mystery
but
it
is
not
simply
a
statement
of
the
mystery
for
the
sake
of
its
mysteriousness
what
is
more
remarkable
still
a
like
silence
as
to
the
mysteriousness
of
the
doctrine
is
observed
in
the
successive
definitions
of
the
church
concerning
it
confession
after
confession
canon
after
canon
is
drawn
up
in
the
course
of
centuries
popes
and
councils
have
found
it
their
duty
to
insist
afresh
upon
the
dogma
they
have
enunciated
it
in
new
or
additional
propositions
but
not
even
in
their
most
elaborate
formularies
do
they
use
the
word
mystery
as
far
as
i
know
the
great
council
of
toledo
pursues
the
scientific
ramifications
of
the
doctrine
with
the
exact
diligence
of
theology
at
a
length
four
times
that
of
the
athanasian
creed
the
fourth
lateran
completes
by
a
final
enunciation
the
development
of
the
sacred
doctrine
after
the
mind
of
augustine
the
creed
of
pope
pius
iv
prescribes
the
general
rule
of
faith
against
the
heresies
of
these
latter
times
but
in
none
of
them
do
we
find
either
the
word
mystery
or
any
suggestion
of
mysteriousness
such
is
the
usage
of
the
church
in
its
dogmatic
statements
concerning
the
holy
trinity
as
if
fulfilling
the
maxim
lex
orandi
lex
i
suppose
it
is
founded
on
a
tradition
because
the
custom
is
otherwise
as
regards
catechisms
and
theological
treatises
these
belong
to
particular
ages
and
places
and
are
addressed
to
the
intellect
in
them
certainly
the
mysteriousness
of
the
doctrine
is
almost
uniformly
insisted
on
but
however
this
contrast
of
usage
is
to
be
explained
the
creeds
are
enough
to
show
that
the
dogma
may
be
taught
in
its
fulness
for
the
purposes
of
popular
faith
and
devotion
without
directly
insisting
on
that
mysteriousness
which
is
necessarily
involved
in
the
combined
view
of
its
separate
propositions
that
systematized
whole
is
the
object
of
notional
assent
and
its
propositions
one
by
one
are
the
objects
of
real
to
show
this
in
fact
i
will
enumerate
the
separate
propositions
of
which
the
dogma
consists
they
are
nine
and
stand
as
follows
there
are
three
who
give
testimony
in
heaven
the
father
the
word
or
son
and
the
holy
spirit
from
the
father
is
and
ever
has
been
the
son
from
the
father
and
son
is
and
ever
has
been
the
spirit
the
father
is
the
one
eternal
personal
god
the
son
is
the
one
eternal
personal
god
the
spirit
is
the
one
eternal
personal
god
the
father
is
not
the
son
the
son
is
not
the
holy
ghost
the
holy
ghost
is
not
the
father
now
i
think
it
is
a
fact
that
whereas
these
nine
propositions
contain
the
mystery
yet
taken
not
as
a
whole
but
separately
each
by
itself
they
are
not
only
apprehensible
but
admit
of
a
real
apprehension
thus
for
instance
if
the
proposition
there
is
one
who
bears
witness
of
himself
or
reveals
himself
would
admit
of
a
real
assent
why
does
not
also
the
proposition
there
are
three
who
bear
witness
again
if
the
word
god
may
create
an
image
in
our
minds
why
may
not
the
proposition
the
father
is
god
or
again
the
son
or
the
holy
ghost
is
god
again
to
say
that
the
son
is
other
than
the
holy
ghost
or
neither
son
nor
holy
ghost
is
the
father
is
not
a
simple
negative
but
also
a
declaration
that
each
of
the
divine
three
by
himself
is
complete
in
himself
and
simply
and
absolutely
god
as
though
the
other
two
were
not
revealed
to
us
again
from
our
experience
of
the
works
of
man
we
accept
with
a
real
apprehension
the
proposition
the
angels
are
made
by
god
correcting
the
word
made
as
is
required
in
the
case
of
a
creating
power
and
a
spiritual
work
may
we
not
in
like
matter
refine
and
elevate
the
human
analogy
yet
keep
the
image
when
a
divine
birth
is
set
before
us
in
terms
which
properly
belong
to
what
is
human
and
earthly
if
our
experience
enables
us
to
apprehend
the
essential
fact
of
sonship
as
being
a
communication
of
being
and
of
nature
from
one
to
another
why
should
we
not
thereby
in
a
certain
measure
realize
the
proposition
the
word
is
the
son
of
god
again
we
have
abundant
instances
in
nature
of
the
general
law
of
one
thing
coming
from
another
or
from
others
the
child
issues
in
the
man
as
his
successor
and
the
child
and
the
man
issue
in
the
old
man
like
them
both
but
not
the
same
so
different
as
almost
to
have
a
fresh
personality
distinct
from
each
so
we
may
form
some
image
however
vague
of
the
procession
of
the
holy
spirit
from
father
and
son
this
is
what
i
should
say
of
the
propositions
which
i
have
numbered
two
and
three
which
are
the
least
susceptible
of
a
real
assent
out
of
the
nine
so
much
at
first
sight
but
the
force
of
what
i
have
been
saying
will
be
best
understood
by
considering
what
scripture
and
the
ritual
of
the
church
witness
in
accordance
with
it
in
referring
to
these
two
great
of
faith
and
devotion
i
must
premise
as
when
i
spoke
of
the
being
of
a
god
that
i
am
not
proving
by
means
of
them
the
dogma
of
the
holy
trinity
but
using
the
one
and
the
other
in
illustration
of
the
action
of
the
separate
articles
of
that
dogma
upon
the
imagination
though
the
complex
truth
in
which
when
combined
they
issue
is
not
in
sympathy
or
correspondence
with
it
but
altogether
beyond
it
and
next
of
the
action
and
influence
of
those
separate
articles
by
means
of
the
imagination
upon
the
affections
and
obedience
of
christians
high
and
low
this
being
understood
i
ask
what
chapter
of
john
or
paul
is
not
full
of
the
three
divine
names
introduced
in
one
or
other
of
the
above
nine
propositions
expressed
or
implied
or
in
their
parallels
or
in
parts
or
equivalents
of
them
what
lesson
is
there
given
us
by
these
two
chief
writers
of
the
new
testament
which
does
not
grow
out
of
their
persons
and
their
offices
at
one
time
we
read
of
the
grace
of
the
second
person
the
love
of
the
first
and
the
communication
of
the
third
at
another
we
are
told
by
the
son
i
will
pray
the
father
and
he
will
send
you
another
paraclete
and
then
all
that
the
father
hath
are
mine
the
paraclete
shall
receive
of
then
again
we
read
of
the
foreknowledge
of
the
father
the
sanctification
of
the
spirit
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
and
again
we
are
to
pray
in
the
holy
ghost
abide
in
the
love
of
god
and
look
for
the
mercy
of
and
so
in
like
manner
to
each
in
one
passage
or
another
are
ascribed
the
same
titles
and
works
each
is
acknowledged
as
lord
each
is
eternal
each
is
truth
each
is
holiness
each
is
all
in
all
each
is
creator
each
wills
with
a
supreme
will
each
is
the
author
of
the
new
birth
each
speaks
in
his
ministers
each
is
the
revealer
each
is
the
lawgiver
each
is
the
teacher
of
the
elect
in
each
the
elect
have
fellowship
each
leads
them
on
each
raises
them
from
the
dead
what
is
all
this
but
the
father
eternal
the
son
eternal
and
the
holy
ghost
eternal
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
omnipotent
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
god
of
the
athanasian
creed
and
if
the
new
testament
be
as
it
confessedly
is
so
real
in
its
teaching
so
luminous
so
impressive
so
constraining
so
full
of
images
so
sparing
in
mere
notions
whence
is
this
but
because
in
its
references
to
the
object
of
our
supreme
worship
it
is
ever
ringing
the
changes
so
to
say
on
the
nine
propositions
which
i
have
set
down
and
on
the
particular
statements
into
which
they
may
be
severally
resolved
take
one
of
them
as
an
instance
viz
the
dogmatic
sentence
the
son
is
what
an
illustration
of
the
real
assent
which
can
be
given
to
this
proposition
and
its
power
over
our
affections
and
emotions
is
the
first
half
of
the
first
chapter
of
john
s
gospel
or
again
the
vision
of
our
lord
in
the
first
chapter
of
the
apocalypse
or
the
first
chapter
of
john
s
first
epistle
again
how
burning
are
paul
s
words
when
he
speaks
of
our
lord
s
crucifixion
and
death
what
is
the
secret
of
that
flame
but
this
same
dogmatic
sentence
the
son
is
god
why
should
the
death
of
the
son
be
more
awful
than
any
other
death
except
that
he
though
man
was
god
and
so
again
all
through
the
old
testament
what
is
it
which
gives
an
interpretation
and
a
persuasive
power
to
so
many
passages
and
portions
especially
of
the
psalms
and
the
prophets
but
this
same
theological
formula
the
messias
is
god
a
proposition
which
never
could
thus
vivify
in
the
religious
mind
the
letter
of
the
sacred
text
unless
it
appealed
to
the
imagination
and
could
be
held
with
a
much
stronger
assent
than
any
that
is
merely
notional
this
same
power
of
the
dogma
may
be
illustrated
from
the
ritual
consider
the
services
for
christmas
or
epiphany
for
easter
ascension
and
i
may
say
corpus
christi
what
are
these
great
festivals
but
comments
on
the
words
the
son
is
god
yet
who
will
say
that
they
have
the
subtlety
the
aridity
the
coldness
of
mere
scholastic
science
are
they
addressed
to
the
pure
intellect
or
to
the
imagination
do
they
interest
our
logical
faculty
or
excite
our
devotion
why
is
it
that
personally
we
often
find
ourselves
so
to
take
part
in
them
except
that
we
are
not
good
enough
that
in
our
case
the
dogma
is
far
too
much
a
theological
notion
far
too
little
an
image
living
within
us
and
so
again
as
to
the
divinity
of
the
holy
ghost
consider
the
breviary
offices
for
pentecost
and
its
octave
the
grandest
perhaps
in
the
whole
year
are
they
created
out
of
mere
abstractions
and
inferences
or
has
not
the
categorical
proposition
of
athanasius
the
holy
ghost
is
god
such
a
place
in
the
imagination
and
the
heart
as
suffices
to
give
birth
to
the
noble
hymns
and
sancte
i
sum
up
then
to
the
same
effect
as
in
the
preceding
section
religion
has
to
do
with
the
real
and
the
real
is
the
particular
theology
has
to
do
with
what
is
notional
and
the
notional
is
the
general
and
systematic
hence
theology
has
to
do
with
the
dogma
of
the
holy
trinity
as
a
whole
made
up
of
many
propositions
but
religion
has
to
do
with
each
of
those
separate
propositions
which
compose
it
and
lives
and
thrives
in
the
contemplation
of
them
in
them
it
finds
the
motives
for
devotion
and
faithful
obedience
while
theology
on
the
other
hand
forms
and
protects
them
by
virtue
of
its
function
of
regarding
them
not
merely
one
by
one
but
as
a
system
of
truth
one
other
remark
is
in
place
here
if
the
separate
articles
of
the
athanasian
creed
are
so
closely
connected
with
vital
and
personal
religion
as
i
have
shown
them
to
be
if
they
supply
motives
on
which
a
man
may
act
if
they
determine
the
state
of
mind
the
special
thoughts
affections
and
habits
which
he
carries
with
him
from
this
world
to
the
next
is
there
cause
to
wonder
that
the
creed
should
proclaim
aloud
that
those
who
are
not
internally
such
as
christ
by
means
of
it
came
to
make
them
are
not
capable
of
the
heaven
to
which
he
died
to
bring
them
is
not
the
importance
of
accepting
the
dogma
the
very
explanation
of
that
careful
minuteness
with
which
the
few
simple
truths
which
compose
it
are
inculcated
are
reiterated
in
the
creed
and
shall
the
church
of
god
to
whom
the
dispensation
of
the
gospel
is
committed
forget
the
concomitant
obligation
woe
is
unto
me
if
i
preach
not
the
gospel
are
her
ministers
by
their
silence
to
bring
upon
themselves
the
prophet
s
anathema
cursed
is
he
that
doth
the
work
of
the
lord
deceitfully
can
they
ever
forget
the
lesson
conveyed
to
them
in
the
apostle
s
protestation
god
is
faithful
as
our
preaching
which
was
among
you
was
not
yea
and
nay
for
we
are
a
good
odour
of
christ
unto
god
in
them
that
are
in
the
way
of
salvation
and
in
them
that
are
perishing
for
we
are
not
as
the
many
who
adulterate
the
word
of
god
but
with
sincerity
but
as
from
god
in
the
presence
of
god
so
speak
we
in
christ
belief
in
dogmatic
theology
it
is
a
familiar
charge
against
the
catholic
church
in
the
mouths
of
her
opponents
that
she
imposes
on
her
children
as
matters
of
faith
not
only
such
dogmas
as
have
an
intimate
bearing
on
moral
conduct
and
character
but
a
great
number
of
doctrines
which
none
but
professed
theologians
can
understand
and
which
in
consequence
do
but
oppress
the
mind
and
are
the
perpetual
fuel
of
controversy
the
first
who
made
this
complaint
was
no
less
a
man
than
the
great
constantine
and
on
no
less
an
occasion
than
the
rise
of
the
arian
heresy
which
he
as
yet
a
catechumen
was
pleased
to
consider
a
trifling
and
tolerable
error
so
deciding
the
matter
he
wrote
at
once
a
letter
to
alexander
bishop
of
alexandria
and
to
arius
who
was
a
presbyter
in
the
same
city
exhorting
them
to
drop
the
matter
in
dispute
and
to
live
in
peace
with
one
another
he
was
answered
by
the
meeting
of
the
council
of
nicæa
and
by
the
insertion
of
the
word
consubstantial
into
the
creed
of
the
church
what
the
emperor
thought
of
the
controversy
itself
that
bishop
jeremy
taylor
thought
of
the
insertion
of
the
consubstantial
viz
that
it
was
a
mischievous
affair
and
ought
never
to
have
taken
place
he
thus
quotes
and
comments
on
the
emperor
s
letter
the
epistle
of
constantine
to
alexander
and
arius
tells
the
truth
and
chides
them
both
for
commencing
the
question
alexander
for
broaching
it
arius
for
taking
it
up
and
although
this
be
true
that
it
had
been
better
for
the
church
it
had
never
begun
yet
being
begun
what
is
to
be
done
with
it
of
this
also
in
that
admirable
epistle
we
have
the
emperor
s
judgment
i
suppose
not
without
the
advice
and
privity
of
hosius
for
first
he
calls
it
a
certain
vain
piece
of
a
question
ill
begun
and
more
unadvisedly
published
question
which
no
law
or
ecclesiastical
canon
defineth
a
fruitless
contention
the
product
of
idle
brains
a
matter
so
nice
so
obscure
so
intricate
that
it
was
neither
to
be
explicated
by
the
clergy
nor
understood
by
the
people
a
dispute
of
words
a
doctrine
inexplicable
but
most
dangerous
when
taught
lest
it
introduce
discord
or
blasphemy
and
therefore
the
objector
was
rash
and
the
answer
unadvised
for
it
concerned
not
the
substance
of
faith
or
the
worship
of
god
nor
the
chief
commandment
of
scripture
and
therefore
why
should
it
be
the
matter
of
discord
for
though
the
matter
be
grave
yet
because
neither
necessary
nor
explicable
the
contention
is
trifling
and
toyish
so
that
the
matter
being
of
no
great
importance
but
vain
and
a
toy
in
respect
of
the
excellent
blessings
of
peace
and
charity
it
were
good
that
alexander
and
arius
should
leave
contending
keep
their
opinions
to
themselves
ask
each
other
forgiveness
and
give
mutual
toleration
moreover
taylor
is
of
opinion
that
they
both
did
believe
one
god
and
the
holy
trinity
an
opinion
in
the
teeth
of
historical
fact
also
he
is
of
opinion
that
that
faith
is
best
which
hath
greatest
simplicity
and
that
it
is
better
in
all
cases
humbly
to
submit
than
curiously
to
inquire
and
pry
into
the
mystery
under
the
cloud
and
to
hazard
our
faith
by
improving
he
is
further
of
opinion
that
if
the
nicene
fathers
had
done
so
too
possibly
the
church
would
never
have
repented
he
also
thinks
that
their
insertion
of
the
consubstantial
into
the
creed
was
a
bad
precedent
whether
it
was
likely
to
act
as
a
precedent
or
not
it
has
not
been
so
in
fact
for
fifteen
hundred
years
have
passed
since
the
nicene
council
and
it
is
the
one
instance
of
a
scientific
word
having
been
introduced
into
the
creed
from
that
day
to
this
and
after
all
the
word
in
question
has
a
plain
meaning
as
the
council
used
it
easily
stated
and
intelligible
to
all
for
consubstantial
with
the
father
means
nothing
more
than
really
one
with
the
father
being
adopted
to
meet
the
evasion
of
the
arians
the
creed
then
remains
now
what
it
was
in
the
beginning
a
popular
form
of
faith
suited
to
every
age
class
and
condition
its
declarations
are
categorical
brief
clear
elementary
of
the
first
importance
expressive
of
the
concrete
the
objects
of
real
apprehension
and
the
basis
and
rule
of
devotion
as
to
the
proper
nicene
formula
itself
excepting
the
one
term
consubstantial
it
has
not
a
word
which
does
not
relate
to
the
rudimental
facts
of
christianity
the
and
the
various
symbols
of
which
the
apostles
is
one
add
summarily
one
or
two
notional
articles
such
as
the
communion
of
saints
and
the
forgiveness
of
sins
which
however
may
be
readily
converted
into
real
propositions
on
the
other
hand
one
chief
dogma
which
is
easy
to
popular
apprehension
is
necessarily
absent
from
all
of
them
the
real
presence
but
the
omission
is
owing
to
the
ancient
disciplina
arcani
which
withheld
the
sacred
mystery
from
catechumens
and
heathen
to
whom
the
creed
was
known
so
far
the
charge
which
taylor
brings
forward
has
no
great
plausibility
but
it
is
not
the
whole
of
his
case
i
can
not
deny
that
a
large
and
collection
of
propositions
abstract
notions
not
concrete
truths
become
by
the
successive
definitions
of
councils
a
portion
of
the
and
have
an
imperative
claim
upon
the
faith
of
every
catholic
and
this
being
the
case
it
will
be
asked
me
how
i
am
borne
out
by
facts
in
enlarging
as
i
have
done
on
the
simplicity
and
directness
on
the
tangible
reality
of
the
church
s
dogmatic
teaching
i
will
suppose
the
objection
urged
thus
has
not
the
catholic
church
limited
her
to
propositions
such
as
those
in
her
creed
concrete
and
practical
easy
of
apprehension
and
of
a
character
to
win
assent
such
as
christ
is
god
this
is
my
body
baptism
gives
life
to
the
soul
the
saints
intercede
for
us
death
judgment
heaven
hell
the
four
last
things
there
are
seven
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
three
theological
virtues
seven
capital
sins
and
the
like
as
they
are
found
in
her
catechisms
on
the
contrary
she
makes
it
imperative
on
every
one
priest
and
layman
to
profess
as
revealed
truth
all
the
canons
of
the
councils
and
innumerable
decisions
of
popes
propositions
so
various
so
notional
that
but
few
can
know
them
and
fewer
can
understand
them
what
sense
for
instance
can
a
child
or
a
peasant
nay
or
any
ordinary
catholic
put
upon
the
tridentine
canons
even
in
translation
such
as
siquis
dixerit
homines
sine
christi
justitiâ
per
quam
nobis
meruit
justificari
aut
per
eam
ipsam
formaliter
justos
esse
anathema
sit
or
siquis
dixerit
justificatum
peccare
dum
intuitu
æternæ
mercedis
bene
operatur
anathema
or
again
consider
the
very
anathema
annexed
by
the
nicene
council
to
its
creed
the
language
of
which
is
so
obscure
that
even
theologians
differ
about
its
meaning
it
runs
as
follows
those
who
say
that
once
the
son
was
not
and
before
he
was
begotten
he
was
not
and
that
he
was
made
out
of
that
which
was
not
or
who
pretend
that
he
was
of
other
hypostasis
or
substance
or
that
the
son
of
god
is
created
mutable
or
alterable
the
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
church
these
doctrinal
enunciations
are
peasants
are
bound
to
believe
them
as
well
as
controversialists
and
to
believe
them
as
truly
as
they
believe
that
our
lord
is
god
how
then
are
the
catholic
easy
and
within
reach
of
all
men
i
begin
my
answer
to
this
objection
by
recurring
to
what
has
already
been
said
concerning
the
relation
of
theology
with
its
notional
propositions
to
religious
and
devotional
assent
devotion
is
excited
doubtless
by
the
plain
categorical
truths
of
revelation
such
as
the
articles
of
the
creed
on
these
it
depends
with
these
it
is
satisfied
it
accepts
them
one
by
one
it
is
careless
about
intellectual
consistency
it
draws
from
each
of
them
the
spiritual
nourishment
which
it
was
intended
to
supply
far
different
certainly
is
the
nature
and
duty
of
the
intellect
it
is
ever
active
inquisitive
penetrating
it
examines
doctrine
and
doctrine
it
compares
contrasts
and
forms
them
into
a
science
that
science
is
theology
now
theological
science
being
thus
the
exercise
of
the
intellect
upon
the
of
revelation
is
though
not
directly
devotional
at
once
natural
excellent
and
necessary
it
is
natural
because
the
intellect
is
one
of
our
highest
faculties
excellent
because
it
is
our
duty
to
use
our
faculties
to
the
full
necessary
because
unless
we
apply
our
intellect
to
revealed
truth
rightly
others
will
exercise
their
minds
upon
it
wrongly
accordingly
the
catholic
intellect
makes
a
survey
and
a
catalogue
of
the
doctrines
contained
in
the
of
revelation
as
committed
to
the
church
s
keeping
it
locates
adjusts
defines
them
each
and
brings
them
together
into
a
whole
moreover
it
takes
particular
aspects
or
portions
of
them
it
analyzes
them
whether
into
first
principles
really
such
or
into
hypotheses
of
an
illustrative
character
it
forms
generalizations
and
gives
names
to
them
all
these
deductions
are
true
if
rightly
deduced
because
they
are
deduced
from
what
is
true
and
therefore
in
one
sense
they
are
a
portion
of
the
of
faith
or
while
in
another
sense
they
are
additions
to
it
however
additions
or
not
they
have
i
readily
grant
the
characteristic
disadvantage
of
being
abstract
and
notional
statements
nor
is
this
all
error
gives
opportunity
to
many
more
additions
than
truth
there
is
another
set
of
deductions
inevitable
also
and
also
part
or
not
part
of
the
revealed
according
as
we
please
to
view
them
if
a
proposition
is
true
its
contradictory
is
false
if
then
a
man
believes
that
christ
is
god
he
believes
also
and
that
necessarily
that
to
say
he
is
not
god
is
false
and
that
those
who
so
say
are
in
error
here
then
again
the
prospect
opens
upon
us
of
a
countless
multitude
of
propositions
which
in
their
first
elements
are
close
upon
devotional
truth
groups
of
propositions
and
those
groups
divergent
independent
ever
springing
into
life
with
an
inexhaustible
fecundity
according
to
the
forms
of
heresy
of
which
they
are
the
antagonists
these
too
have
their
place
in
theological
science
such
is
theology
in
contrast
to
religion
and
as
follows
from
the
circumstances
of
its
formation
though
some
of
its
statements
easily
find
equivalents
in
the
language
of
devotion
the
greater
number
of
them
are
more
or
less
unintelligible
to
the
ordinary
catholic
as
to
the
private
citizen
and
especially
those
portions
of
theology
which
are
the
indirect
creation
not
of
orthodox
but
of
heretical
thought
such
as
the
repudiations
of
error
contained
in
the
canons
of
councils
of
which
specimens
have
been
given
above
will
ever
be
foreign
strange
and
hard
to
the
pious
but
uncontroversial
mind
for
what
have
good
christians
to
do
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
with
the
subtle
hallucinations
of
the
intellect
this
is
manifest
from
the
nature
of
the
case
but
then
the
question
recurs
why
should
the
refutations
of
heresy
be
our
objects
of
faith
if
no
mind
theological
or
not
can
believe
what
it
can
not
understand
in
what
sense
can
the
canons
of
councils
and
other
ecclesiastical
determinations
be
included
in
those
which
the
church
presents
to
every
catholic
as
if
apprehensible
and
to
which
every
catholic
gives
his
firm
interior
assent
in
solving
this
difficulty
i
wish
it
first
observed
that
if
it
is
the
duty
of
the
church
to
act
as
the
pillar
and
ground
of
the
truth
she
is
manifestly
obliged
from
time
to
time
and
to
the
end
of
time
to
denounce
opinions
incompatible
with
that
truth
whenever
able
and
subtle
minds
in
her
communion
venture
to
publish
such
opinions
suppose
certain
bishops
and
priests
at
this
day
began
to
teach
that
islamism
or
buddhism
was
a
direct
and
immediate
revelation
from
god
she
would
be
bound
to
use
the
authority
which
god
has
given
her
to
declare
that
such
a
proposition
will
not
stand
with
christianity
and
that
those
who
hold
it
are
none
of
hers
and
she
would
be
bound
to
impose
such
a
declaration
on
that
very
knot
of
persons
who
had
committed
themselves
to
the
novel
proposition
in
order
that
if
they
would
not
recant
they
might
be
separated
from
her
communion
as
they
were
separate
from
her
faith
in
such
a
case
her
masses
of
population
would
either
not
hear
of
the
controversy
or
they
would
at
once
take
part
with
her
and
without
effort
take
any
test
which
secured
the
exclusion
of
the
innovators
and
she
on
the
other
hand
would
feel
that
what
is
a
rule
for
some
catholics
must
be
a
rule
for
all
who
is
to
draw
the
line
between
who
are
to
acknowledge
it
and
who
are
not
it
is
plain
there
can
not
be
two
rules
of
faith
in
the
same
communion
or
rather
as
the
case
really
would
be
an
endless
variety
of
rules
coming
into
force
according
to
the
multiplication
of
heretical
theories
and
to
the
degrees
of
knowledge
and
varieties
of
sentiment
in
individual
catholics
there
is
but
one
rule
of
faith
for
all
and
it
would
be
a
greater
difficulty
to
allow
of
an
uncertain
rule
of
faith
than
if
that
was
the
alternative
as
it
is
not
to
impose
upon
uneducated
minds
a
profession
which
they
can
not
understand
but
it
is
not
the
necessary
result
of
unity
of
profession
nor
is
it
the
fact
that
the
church
imposes
dogmatic
statements
on
the
interior
assent
of
those
who
can
not
apprehend
them
the
difficulty
is
removed
by
the
dogma
of
the
church
s
infallibility
and
of
the
consequent
duty
of
implicit
faith
in
her
word
the
one
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
church
is
an
article
of
the
creed
and
an
article
which
inclusive
of
her
infallibility
all
men
high
and
low
can
easily
master
and
accept
with
a
real
and
operative
assent
it
stands
in
the
place
of
all
abstruse
propositions
in
a
catholic
s
mind
for
to
believe
in
her
word
is
virtually
to
believe
in
them
all
even
what
he
can
not
understand
at
least
he
can
believe
to
be
true
and
he
believes
it
to
be
true
because
he
believes
in
the
church
the
of
this
provision
for
unlearned
devotion
is
as
follows
stands
to
reason
that
all
of
us
learned
and
unlearned
are
bound
to
believe
the
whole
revealed
doctrine
in
all
its
parts
and
in
all
that
it
implies
according
as
portion
after
portion
is
brought
home
to
our
consciousness
as
belonging
to
it
and
it
also
stands
to
reason
that
a
doctrine
so
deep
and
so
various
as
the
revealed
of
faith
can
not
be
brought
home
to
us
and
made
our
own
all
at
once
no
mind
however
large
however
penetrating
can
directly
and
fully
by
one
act
understand
any
one
truth
however
simple
what
can
be
more
intelligible
than
that
alexander
conquered
asia
or
that
veracity
is
a
duty
but
what
a
multitude
of
propositions
is
included
under
either
of
these
theses
still
if
we
profess
either
we
profess
all
that
it
includes
thus
as
regards
the
catholic
creed
if
we
really
believe
that
our
lord
is
god
we
believe
all
that
is
meant
by
such
a
belief
or
else
we
are
not
in
earnest
when
we
profess
to
believe
the
proposition
in
the
act
of
believing
it
at
all
we
forthwith
commit
ourselves
by
anticipation
to
believe
truths
which
at
present
we
do
not
believe
because
they
have
never
come
before
us
limit
henceforth
the
range
of
our
private
judgment
in
prospect
by
the
conditions
whatever
they
are
of
that
dogma
thus
the
arians
said
that
they
believed
in
our
lord
s
divinity
but
when
they
were
pressed
to
confess
his
eternity
they
denied
it
thereby
showing
in
fact
that
they
never
had
believed
in
his
divinity
at
all
in
other
words
a
man
who
really
believes
in
our
lord
s
proper
divinity
believes
in
his
eternity
and
so
in
like
manner
of
the
whole
of
faith
or
the
revealed
word
we
believe
in
the
revelation
we
believe
in
what
is
revealed
in
all
that
is
revealed
however
it
may
be
brought
home
to
us
by
reasoning
or
in
any
other
way
he
who
believes
that
christ
is
the
truth
and
that
the
evangelists
are
truthful
believes
all
that
he
has
said
through
them
though
he
has
only
read
matthew
and
has
not
read
john
he
who
believes
in
the
of
revelation
believes
in
all
the
doctrines
of
the
and
since
he
can
not
know
them
all
at
once
he
knows
some
doctrines
and
does
not
know
others
he
may
know
only
the
creed
nay
perhaps
only
the
chief
portions
of
the
creed
but
whether
he
knows
little
or
much
he
has
the
intention
of
believing
all
that
there
is
to
believe
whenever
and
as
soon
as
it
is
brought
home
to
him
if
he
believes
in
revelation
at
all
all
that
he
knows
now
as
revealed
and
all
that
he
shall
know
and
all
that
there
is
to
know
he
embraces
it
all
in
his
intention
by
one
act
of
faith
otherwise
it
is
but
an
accident
that
he
believes
this
or
that
not
because
it
is
a
revelation
this
virtual
interpretative
or
prospective
belief
is
called
a
believing
and
it
follows
from
this
that
granting
that
the
canons
of
councils
and
the
other
ecclesiastical
documents
and
confessions
to
which
i
have
referred
are
really
involved
in
the
or
revealed
word
every
catholic
in
accepting
the
does
accept
those
dogmatic
decisions
i
say
granting
these
various
propositions
are
virtually
contained
in
the
revealed
word
for
this
is
the
only
question
left
and
that
it
is
to
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
is
clear
at
once
to
the
catholic
from
the
fact
that
the
church
declares
that
they
really
belong
to
it
to
her
is
committed
the
care
and
the
interpretation
of
the
revelation
the
word
of
the
church
is
the
word
of
the
revelation
that
the
church
is
the
infallible
oracle
of
truth
is
the
fundamental
dogma
of
the
catholic
religion
and
i
believe
what
the
church
proposes
to
be
believed
is
an
act
of
real
assent
including
all
particular
assents
notional
and
real
and
while
it
is
possible
for
unlearned
as
well
as
learned
it
is
imperative
on
learned
as
well
as
unlearned
and
thus
it
is
that
by
believing
the
word
of
the
church
that
is
by
believing
all
that
that
word
does
or
shall
declare
itself
to
contain
every
catholic
according
to
his
intellectual
capacity
supplements
the
shortcomings
of
his
knowledge
without
blunting
his
real
assent
to
what
is
elementary
and
takes
upon
himself
from
the
first
the
whole
truth
of
revelation
progressing
from
one
apprehension
of
it
to
another
according
to
his
opportunities
of
doing
so
part
ii
assent
and
inference
chapter
vi
assent
considered
as
unconditional
i
have
now
said
as
much
as
need
be
said
about
the
relation
of
assent
to
apprehension
and
shall
turn
to
the
consideration
of
the
relation
existing
between
assent
and
inference
as
apprehension
is
a
concomitant
so
inference
is
ordinarily
the
antecedent
of
assent
this
surely
i
need
not
enlarge
neither
apprehension
nor
inference
interferes
with
the
unconditional
character
of
the
assent
viewed
in
itself
the
circumstances
of
an
act
however
necessary
to
it
do
not
enter
into
the
act
assent
is
in
its
nature
absolute
and
unconditional
though
it
can
not
be
given
except
under
certain
conditions
this
is
obvious
but
what
presents
some
difficulty
is
this
how
it
is
that
a
conditional
acceptance
of
a
proposition
as
is
an
act
of
inference
able
to
lead
as
it
does
to
an
unconditional
acceptance
of
it
as
is
assent
how
it
is
that
a
proposition
which
is
not
and
can
not
be
demonstrated
which
at
the
highest
can
only
be
proved
to
be
not
true
such
as
i
shall
die
nevertheless
claims
and
receives
our
unqualified
adhesion
to
the
consideration
of
this
paradox
as
it
may
be
called
i
shall
now
proceed
that
is
to
the
consideration
first
of
the
act
of
assent
to
a
proposition
which
act
is
unconditional
next
of
the
act
of
inference
which
goes
before
the
assent
and
is
conditional
and
thirdly
of
the
solution
of
the
apparent
inconsistency
which
is
involved
in
holding
that
an
unconditional
acceptance
of
a
proposition
can
be
the
result
of
its
conditional
verification
simple
assent
the
doctrine
which
i
have
been
enunciating
requires
such
careful
explanation
that
it
is
not
wonderful
that
writers
of
great
ability
and
name
are
to
be
found
who
have
put
it
aside
for
a
doctrine
of
their
own
but
no
doctrine
on
the
subject
is
without
its
difficulties
and
certainly
not
theirs
though
it
carries
with
it
a
show
of
common
sense
the
authors
to
whom
i
refer
wish
to
maintain
that
there
are
degrees
of
assent
and
that
as
the
reasons
for
a
proposition
are
strong
or
weak
so
is
the
assent
it
follows
from
this
that
absolute
assent
has
no
legitimate
exercise
except
as
ratifying
acts
of
intuition
or
demonstration
what
is
thus
brought
home
to
us
is
indeed
to
be
accepted
unconditionally
but
as
to
reasonings
in
concrete
matters
they
are
never
more
than
probabilities
and
the
probability
in
each
conclusion
which
we
draw
is
the
measure
of
our
assent
to
that
conclusion
thus
assent
becomes
a
sort
of
necessary
shadow
following
upon
inference
which
is
the
substance
and
is
never
without
some
alloy
of
doubt
because
inference
in
the
concrete
never
reaches
more
than
probability
such
is
what
may
be
called
the
method
of
regarding
assent
in
its
relation
to
inference
it
condemns
an
unconditional
assent
in
concrete
matters
on
what
may
be
called
the
nature
of
the
case
assent
can
not
rise
higher
than
its
source
inference
in
such
matters
is
at
best
conditional
therefore
assent
is
conditional
also
abstract
argument
is
always
dangerous
and
this
instance
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
i
prefer
to
go
by
facts
the
theory
to
which
i
have
referred
can
not
be
carried
out
in
practice
it
may
be
rightly
said
to
prove
too
much
for
it
debars
us
from
unconditional
assent
in
cases
in
which
the
common
voice
of
mankind
the
advocates
of
this
theory
included
would
protest
against
the
prohibition
there
are
many
truths
in
concrete
matter
which
no
one
can
demonstrate
yet
every
one
unconditionally
accepts
and
though
of
course
there
are
innumerable
propositions
to
which
it
would
be
absurd
to
give
an
absolute
assent
still
the
absurdity
lies
in
the
circumstances
of
each
particular
case
as
it
is
taken
by
itself
not
in
their
common
violation
of
the
pretentious
axiom
that
probable
reasoning
can
never
lead
to
certitude
locke
s
remarks
on
the
subject
are
an
illustration
of
what
i
have
been
saying
this
celebrated
writer
after
the
manner
of
his
school
speaks
freely
of
degrees
of
assent
and
considers
that
the
strength
of
assent
given
to
each
proposition
varies
with
the
strength
of
the
inference
on
which
the
assent
follows
yet
he
is
obliged
to
make
exceptions
to
his
general
principle
unintelligible
on
his
abstract
doctrine
but
demanded
by
the
logic
of
facts
the
practice
of
mankind
is
too
strong
for
the
antecedent
theorem
to
which
he
is
desirous
to
subject
it
first
he
says
in
his
chapter
on
probability
most
of
the
propositions
we
think
reason
discourse
nay
act
upon
are
such
as
we
can
not
have
undoubted
knowledge
of
their
truth
yet
some
of
them
so
upon
certainty
that
we
no
doubt
at
about
them
but
to
them
and
act
according
to
that
assent
as
resolutely
if
they
were
infallibly
and
that
our
knowledge
of
them
was
perfect
and
here
he
allows
that
inferences
which
are
only
near
upon
certainty
are
so
near
that
we
legitimately
accept
them
with
no
doubt
at
all
and
assent
to
them
as
firmly
as
if
they
were
infallibly
that
is
he
affirms
and
sanctions
the
very
paradox
to
which
i
am
committed
myself
again
he
says
in
his
chapter
on
the
degrees
of
assent
that
when
any
particular
thing
consonant
to
the
constant
observation
of
ourselves
and
others
in
the
like
case
comes
attested
by
the
concurrent
reports
of
all
that
mention
it
we
receive
it
as
easily
and
build
as
firmly
upon
it
as
if
it
were
certain
knowledge
and
we
reason
and
act
thereupon
as
little
doubt
as
if
it
were
perfect
and
he
repeats
these
rise
so
near
to
certainty
that
they
our
thoughts
as
and
influence
all
our
actions
as
fully
as
most
evident
and
in
what
concerns
us
we
make
little
or
no
difference
between
them
and
certain
knowledge
belief
thus
grounded
rises
to
here
again
probabilities
may
be
so
strong
as
to
govern
our
thoughts
as
absolutely
as
sheer
demonstration
so
strong
that
belief
grounded
on
them
rises
to
assurance
that
is
certitude
i
have
so
high
a
respect
both
for
the
character
and
the
ability
of
locke
for
his
manly
simplicity
of
mind
and
his
outspoken
candour
and
there
is
so
much
in
his
remarks
upon
reasoning
and
proof
in
which
i
fully
concur
that
i
feel
no
pleasure
in
considering
him
in
the
light
of
an
opponent
to
views
which
i
myself
have
ever
cherished
as
true
with
an
obstinate
devotion
and
i
would
willingly
think
that
in
the
passage
which
follows
in
his
chapter
on
enthusiasm
he
is
aiming
at
superstitious
extravagances
which
i
should
repudiate
myself
as
much
as
he
can
do
but
if
so
his
words
go
beyond
the
occasion
and
contradict
what
i
have
quoted
from
him
above
he
that
would
seriously
set
upon
the
search
of
truth
ought
in
the
first
place
to
prepare
his
mind
with
a
love
of
it
for
he
that
loves
it
not
will
not
take
much
pains
to
get
it
nor
be
much
concerned
when
he
misses
it
there
is
nobody
in
the
commonwealth
of
learning
who
does
not
profess
himself
a
lover
of
truth
there
is
not
a
rational
creature
that
would
not
take
it
amiss
to
be
thought
otherwise
of
and
yet
for
all
this
one
may
truly
say
there
are
very
few
lovers
of
truth
for
even
amongst
those
who
persuade
themselves
that
they
are
so
how
a
man
may
know
whether
he
be
so
in
earnest
is
worth
inquiry
and
i
think
there
is
this
one
unerring
mark
of
it
viz
not
entertaining
any
proposition
with
greater
assurance
than
the
proofs
it
is
built
on
will
whoever
goes
beyond
this
measure
of
assent
it
is
plain
receives
not
truth
in
the
love
of
it
loves
not
truth
for
but
for
some
other
for
the
evidence
that
any
proposition
is
true
such
as
are
lying
only
in
the
proofs
a
man
has
of
it
whatsoever
degrees
of
assent
he
affords
it
the
degrees
of
evidence
it
is
plain
that
surplusage
of
is
owing
to
some
other
affection
and
not
to
the
love
of
truth
it
being
as
that
the
love
of
truth
should
carry
assent
above
the
there
is
to
me
that
it
is
true
as
that
the
love
of
truth
should
make
me
assent
to
any
proposition
for
the
sake
of
that
evidence
which
it
has
not
that
it
is
true
which
is
in
effect
to
love
it
as
a
truth
because
it
is
possible
or
probable
that
it
may
not
be
true
here
he
says
that
it
is
not
only
illogical
but
immoral
to
carry
our
the
that
a
proposition
is
true
to
have
a
surplusage
of
the
degrees
of
that
and
he
excepts
from
this
rule
only
propositions
how
then
is
it
not
inconsistent
with
right
reason
with
the
love
of
truth
for
its
own
sake
to
allow
in
his
words
quoted
above
certain
strong
probabilities
to
govern
our
thoughts
as
absolutely
as
the
most
evident
demonstration
how
is
there
no
surplusage
of
assurance
beyond
the
degrees
of
evidence
when
in
the
case
of
those
strong
probabilities
we
permit
our
belief
thus
grounded
to
rise
to
assurance
as
he
pronounces
we
are
rational
in
doing
of
course
he
had
in
view
one
set
of
instances
when
he
implied
that
demonstration
was
the
condition
of
absolute
assent
and
another
set
when
he
said
that
it
was
no
such
condition
but
he
surely
can
not
be
acquitted
of
slovenly
thinking
in
thus
treating
a
cardinal
subject
a
philosopher
should
so
anticipate
the
application
and
guard
the
enunciation
of
his
principles
as
to
secure
them
against
the
risk
of
their
being
made
to
change
places
with
each
other
to
defend
what
he
is
eager
to
denounce
and
to
condemn
what
he
finds
it
necessary
to
sanction
however
whatever
is
to
be
thought
of
his
method
and
his
logical
consistency
his
i
fear
must
be
understood
as
hostile
to
the
doctrine
which
i
am
going
to
maintain
he
takes
a
view
of
the
human
mind
in
relation
to
inference
and
assent
which
to
me
seems
theoretical
and
unreal
reasonings
and
convictions
which
i
deem
natural
and
legitimate
he
apparently
would
call
irrational
enthusiastic
perverse
and
immoral
and
that
as
i
think
because
he
consults
his
own
ideal
of
how
the
mind
ought
to
act
instead
of
interrogating
human
nature
as
an
existing
thing
as
it
is
found
in
the
world
instead
of
going
by
the
testimony
of
psychological
facts
and
thereby
determining
our
constitutive
faculties
and
our
proper
condition
and
being
content
with
the
mind
as
god
has
made
it
he
would
form
men
as
he
thinks
they
ought
to
be
formed
into
something
better
and
higher
and
calls
them
irrational
and
immoral
if
so
to
speak
they
take
to
the
water
instead
of
remaining
under
the
narrow
wings
of
his
own
arbitrary
theory
now
the
first
question
which
this
theory
leads
me
to
consider
is
whether
there
is
such
an
act
of
the
mind
as
assent
at
all
if
there
is
it
is
plain
it
ought
to
show
itself
unequivocally
as
such
as
distinct
from
other
acts
for
if
a
professed
act
can
only
be
viewed
as
the
recessary
and
immediate
repetition
of
another
act
if
assent
is
a
sort
of
reproduction
and
double
of
an
act
of
inference
if
when
inference
determines
that
a
proposition
is
somewhat
or
not
a
little
or
a
good
deal
or
very
like
truth
assent
as
its
natural
and
normal
counterpart
says
that
it
is
somewhat
or
not
a
little
or
a
good
deal
or
very
like
truth
then
i
do
not
see
what
we
mean
by
saying
or
why
we
say
at
all
that
there
is
any
such
act
it
is
simply
superfluous
in
a
psychological
point
of
view
and
a
curiosity
of
subtle
minds
and
the
sooner
it
is
got
out
of
the
way
the
better
when
i
assent
i
am
supposed
it
seems
to
do
precisely
what
i
do
when
i
infer
or
rather
not
quite
so
much
but
something
which
is
included
in
inferring
for
while
the
disposition
of
my
mind
towards
a
given
proposition
is
identical
in
assent
and
in
inference
i
merely
drop
the
thought
of
the
premisses
when
i
assent
though
not
of
their
influence
on
the
proposition
inferred
this
then
and
no
more
after
all
is
what
nature
prescribes
and
this
and
no
more
than
this
is
the
conscientious
use
of
our
faculties
so
to
assent
forsooth
as
to
do
nothing
else
than
infer
then
i
say
if
this
be
really
the
state
of
the
case
if
assent
in
no
real
way
differs
from
inference
it
is
one
and
the
same
thing
with
it
it
is
another
name
for
inference
and
to
speak
of
it
at
all
does
but
mislead
nor
can
it
fairly
be
urged
as
a
parallel
case
that
an
act
of
conscious
recognition
though
distinct
from
an
act
of
knowledge
is
after
all
only
its
repetition
on
the
contrary
such
a
recognition
is
a
reflex
act
with
its
own
object
viz
the
act
of
knowledge
itself
as
well
might
it
be
said
that
the
hearing
of
the
notes
of
my
voice
is
a
repetition
of
the
act
of
singing
gives
no
plausibility
then
to
the
anomaly
i
am
combating
i
lay
it
down
then
as
a
principle
that
either
assent
is
intrinsically
distinct
from
inference
or
the
sooner
we
get
rid
of
the
word
in
philosophy
the
better
if
it
be
only
the
echo
of
an
inference
do
not
treat
it
as
a
substantive
act
but
on
the
other
hand
supposing
it
be
not
such
an
idle
repetition
as
i
am
sure
it
is
not
supposing
the
word
assent
does
hold
a
necessary
place
in
language
and
in
thought
if
it
does
not
admit
of
being
confused
with
concluding
and
inferring
if
the
two
words
are
used
for
two
operations
of
the
intellect
which
can
not
change
their
character
if
in
matter
of
fact
they
are
not
always
found
together
if
they
do
not
vary
with
each
other
if
one
is
sometimes
found
without
the
other
if
one
is
strong
when
the
other
is
weak
if
sometimes
they
seem
even
in
conflict
with
each
other
then
since
we
know
perfectly
well
what
an
inference
is
it
comes
upon
us
to
consider
what
as
distinct
from
inference
an
assent
is
and
we
are
by
the
very
fact
of
its
being
distinct
advanced
one
step
towards
that
account
of
it
which
i
think
is
the
true
one
the
first
step
then
towards
deciding
the
point
will
be
to
inquire
what
the
experience
of
human
life
as
it
is
daily
brought
before
us
teaches
us
of
the
relation
to
each
other
of
inference
and
assent
first
we
know
from
experience
that
assents
may
endure
without
the
presence
of
the
inferential
acts
upon
which
they
were
originally
elicited
it
is
plain
that
as
life
goes
on
we
are
not
only
inwardly
formed
and
changed
by
the
accession
of
habits
but
we
are
also
enriched
by
a
great
multitude
of
beliefs
and
opinions
and
that
on
a
variety
of
subjects
these
beliefs
and
opinions
held
as
some
of
them
are
almost
as
first
principles
are
assents
and
they
constitute
as
it
were
the
clothing
and
furniture
of
the
mind
i
have
already
spoken
of
them
under
the
head
of
credence
and
sometimes
we
are
fully
conscious
of
them
sometimes
they
are
implicit
or
only
now
and
then
come
directly
before
our
reflective
faculty
still
they
are
assents
and
when
we
first
admitted
them
we
had
some
kind
of
reason
slight
or
strong
recognized
or
not
for
doing
so
however
whatever
those
reasons
were
even
if
we
ever
realized
them
we
have
long
forgotten
them
whether
it
was
the
authority
of
others
or
our
own
observation
or
our
reading
or
our
reflections
which
became
the
warrant
of
our
assent
any
how
we
received
the
matters
in
question
into
our
minds
as
true
and
gave
them
a
place
there
we
assented
to
them
and
we
still
assent
though
we
have
forgotten
what
the
warrant
was
at
present
they
are
in
our
minds
and
have
been
so
for
long
years
they
are
in
no
sense
conclusions
they
imply
no
process
of
thought
here
then
is
a
case
in
which
assent
stands
out
as
distinct
from
inference
again
sometimes
assent
fails
while
the
reasons
for
it
and
the
inferential
act
which
is
the
recognition
of
those
reasons
are
still
present
and
in
force
our
reasons
may
seem
to
us
as
strong
as
ever
yet
they
do
not
secure
our
assent
our
beliefs
founded
on
them
were
and
are
not
we
can
not
perhaps
tell
when
they
went
we
may
have
thought
that
we
still
held
them
till
something
happened
to
call
our
attention
to
the
state
of
our
minds
and
then
we
found
that
our
assent
had
become
an
assertion
sometimes
of
course
a
cause
may
be
found
why
they
went
there
may
have
been
some
vague
feeling
that
a
fault
lay
at
the
ultimate
basis
or
in
the
underlying
conditions
of
our
reasonings
or
some
misgiving
that
the
of
them
was
beyond
the
reach
of
the
human
mind
or
a
consciousness
that
we
had
gained
a
broader
view
of
things
in
general
than
when
we
first
gave
our
assent
or
that
there
were
strong
objections
to
our
first
convictions
which
we
had
never
taken
into
account
but
this
is
not
always
so
sometimes
our
mind
changes
so
quickly
so
unaccountably
so
disproportionately
to
any
tangible
arguments
to
which
the
change
can
be
referred
and
with
such
abiding
recognition
of
the
force
of
the
old
arguments
as
to
suggest
the
suspicion
that
moral
causes
arising
out
of
our
condition
age
company
occupations
fortunes
are
at
the
bottom
however
what
once
was
assent
is
gone
yet
the
perception
of
the
old
arguments
remains
showing
that
inference
is
one
thing
and
assent
another
and
as
assent
sometimes
dies
out
without
tangible
reasons
sufficient
to
account
for
its
failure
so
sometimes
in
spite
of
strong
and
convincing
arguments
it
is
never
given
we
sometimes
find
men
loud
in
their
admiration
of
truths
which
they
never
profess
as
by
the
law
of
our
mental
constitution
obedience
is
quite
distinct
from
faith
and
men
may
believe
without
practising
so
is
assent
also
independent
of
our
acts
of
inference
again
prejudice
hinders
assent
to
the
most
incontrovertible
proofs
again
it
not
unfrequently
happens
that
while
the
keenness
of
the
ratiocinative
faculty
enables
a
man
to
see
the
ultimate
result
of
a
complicated
problem
in
a
moment
it
takes
years
for
him
to
embrace
it
as
a
truth
and
to
recognize
it
as
an
item
in
the
circle
of
his
knowledge
yet
he
does
at
last
so
accept
it
and
then
we
say
that
he
assents
again
very
numerous
are
the
cases
in
which
good
arguments
and
really
good
as
far
as
they
go
and
confessed
by
us
to
be
good
nevertheless
are
not
strong
enough
to
incline
our
minds
ever
so
little
to
the
conclusion
at
which
they
point
but
why
is
it
that
we
do
not
assent
a
little
in
proportion
to
those
arguments
on
the
contrary
we
throw
the
full
on
the
side
of
the
conclusion
and
we
refuse
to
assent
to
it
at
all
until
we
can
assent
to
it
altogether
the
proof
is
capable
of
growth
but
the
assent
either
exists
or
does
not
exist
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
influence
of
moral
motives
in
hindering
assent
to
conclusions
which
are
logically
unimpeachable
according
to
the
couplet
a
man
convinced
against
his
will
is
of
the
same
opinion
still
assent
then
is
not
the
same
as
inference
strange
as
it
may
seem
this
contrast
between
inference
and
assent
is
exemplified
even
in
the
province
of
mathematics
argument
is
not
always
able
to
command
our
assent
even
though
it
be
demonstrative
sometimes
of
course
it
forces
its
way
that
is
when
the
steps
of
the
reasoning
are
few
and
admit
of
being
viewed
by
the
mind
altogether
certainly
one
can
not
conceive
a
man
having
before
him
the
series
of
conditions
and
truths
on
which
it
depends
that
the
three
angles
of
a
triangle
are
together
equal
to
two
right
angles
and
yet
not
assenting
to
that
proposition
were
all
propositions
as
plain
though
assent
would
not
in
consequence
be
the
same
act
as
inference
yet
it
would
certainly
follow
immediately
upon
it
i
allow
then
as
much
as
this
that
when
an
argument
is
in
itself
and
by
itself
conclusive
of
a
truth
it
has
by
a
law
of
our
nature
the
same
command
over
our
assent
or
rather
the
truth
which
it
has
reached
has
the
same
command
as
our
senses
have
certainly
our
intellectual
nature
is
under
laws
and
the
correlative
of
ascertained
truth
is
unreserved
assent
but
i
am
not
speaking
of
short
and
lucid
demonstrations
but
of
long
and
intricate
mathematical
investigations
and
in
that
case
though
every
step
may
be
indisputable
it
still
requires
a
specially
sustained
attention
and
an
effort
of
memory
to
have
in
the
mind
all
at
once
all
the
steps
of
the
proof
with
their
bearings
on
each
other
and
the
antecedents
which
they
severally
involve
and
these
conditions
of
the
inference
may
interfere
with
the
promptness
of
our
assent
hence
it
is
that
party
spirit
or
national
feeling
or
religious
prepossessions
have
before
now
had
power
to
retard
the
reception
of
truths
of
a
mathematical
character
which
never
could
have
been
if
demonstrations
were
assents
nor
indeed
would
any
mathematician
even
in
questions
of
pure
science
assent
to
his
own
conclusions
on
new
and
difficult
ground
and
in
the
case
of
abstruse
calculations
however
often
he
went
over
his
work
till
he
had
the
corroboration
of
other
judgments
besides
his
own
he
would
have
carefully
revised
his
inference
and
would
assent
to
the
probability
of
his
accuracy
in
inferring
but
still
he
would
abstain
from
an
immediate
assent
to
the
truth
of
his
conclusion
yet
the
corroboration
of
others
can
not
add
to
his
perception
of
the
proof
he
would
still
perceive
the
proof
even
though
he
failed
in
gaining
their
corroboration
and
yet
again
he
might
arbitrarily
make
it
his
rule
never
to
assent
to
his
conclusions
without
such
corroboration
or
at
least
before
the
lapse
of
a
sufficient
interval
here
again
inference
is
distinct
from
assent
i
have
been
showing
that
inference
and
assent
are
distinct
acts
of
the
mind
and
that
they
may
be
made
apart
from
each
other
of
course
i
can
not
be
taken
to
mean
that
there
is
no
legitimate
or
actual
connexion
between
them
as
if
arguments
adverse
to
a
conclusion
did
not
naturally
hinder
assent
or
as
if
the
inclination
to
give
assent
were
not
greater
or
less
according
as
the
particular
act
of
inference
expressed
a
stronger
or
weaker
probability
or
as
if
assent
did
not
always
imply
grounds
in
reason
implicit
if
not
explicit
or
could
be
rightly
given
without
sufficient
grounds
so
much
is
it
commonly
felt
that
assent
must
be
preceded
by
inferential
acts
that
obstinate
men
give
their
own
will
as
their
very
reason
for
assenting
if
they
can
think
of
nothing
better
stat
pro
ratione
indeed
i
doubt
whether
assent
is
ever
given
without
some
preliminary
which
stands
for
a
reason
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
it
may
not
be
withheld
in
cases
when
there
are
good
reasons
for
giving
it
to
a
proposition
or
may
not
be
withdrawn
after
it
has
been
given
the
reasons
remaining
or
may
not
remain
when
the
reasons
are
forgotten
or
must
always
vary
in
strength
as
the
reasons
vary
and
this
substantiveness
as
i
may
call
it
of
the
act
of
assent
is
the
very
point
which
i
have
wished
to
establish
and
in
showing
that
assent
is
distinct
from
an
act
of
inference
i
have
gone
a
good
way
towards
showing
in
what
it
differs
from
it
if
assent
and
inference
are
each
of
them
the
acceptance
of
a
proposition
but
the
special
characteristic
of
inference
is
that
it
is
conditional
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
assent
is
unconditional
again
if
assent
is
the
acceptance
of
truth
and
truth
is
the
proper
object
of
the
intellect
and
no
one
can
hold
conditionally
what
by
the
same
act
he
holds
to
be
true
here
too
is
a
reason
for
saying
that
assent
is
an
adhesion
without
reserve
or
doubt
to
the
proposition
to
which
it
is
given
and
again
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
word
has
not
two
meanings
what
it
has
at
one
time
it
has
at
another
inference
is
always
inference
even
if
demonstrative
it
is
still
conditional
it
establishes
an
incontrovertible
conclusion
on
the
condition
of
incontrovertible
premisses
to
the
conclusion
thus
drawn
assent
gives
its
absolute
recognition
in
the
case
of
all
demonstrations
assent
when
given
is
unconditionally
given
in
one
class
of
subjects
then
assent
certainly
is
always
unconditional
but
if
the
word
stands
for
an
undoubting
and
unhesitating
act
of
the
mind
once
why
does
it
not
denote
the
same
always
what
evidence
is
there
that
it
ever
means
any
thing
else
than
that
which
the
whole
world
will
unite
in
witnessing
that
it
means
in
certain
cases
why
are
we
not
to
interpret
what
is
controverted
by
what
is
known
this
is
what
is
suggested
on
the
first
view
of
the
question
but
to
continue
in
demonstrative
matters
assent
excludes
the
presence
of
doubt
now
are
instances
producible
on
the
other
hand
of
its
ever
with
doubt
in
cases
of
the
concrete
as
the
above
instances
have
shown
on
very
many
questions
we
do
not
give
an
assent
at
all
what
commonly
happens
is
this
that
after
hearing
and
entering
into
what
may
be
said
for
a
proposition
we
pronounce
neither
for
nor
against
it
we
may
accept
the
conclusion
as
a
conclusion
dependent
on
premisses
abstract
and
tending
to
the
concrete
but
we
do
not
follow
up
our
inference
of
a
proposition
by
giving
an
assent
to
it
that
there
are
concrete
propositions
to
which
we
give
unconditional
assents
i
shall
presently
show
but
i
am
now
asking
for
instances
of
conditional
for
instances
in
which
we
assent
a
little
and
not
much
usually
we
do
not
assent
at
all
every
day
as
it
comes
brings
with
it
opportunities
for
us
to
enlarge
our
circle
of
assents
we
read
the
newspapers
we
look
through
debates
in
parliament
pleadings
in
the
law
courts
leading
articles
letters
of
correspondents
reviews
of
books
criticisms
in
the
fine
arts
and
we
either
form
no
opinion
at
all
upon
the
subjects
discussed
as
lying
out
of
our
line
or
at
most
we
have
only
an
opinion
about
them
at
the
utmost
we
say
that
we
are
inclined
to
believe
this
proposition
or
that
that
we
are
not
sure
it
is
not
true
that
much
may
be
said
for
it
that
we
have
been
much
struck
by
it
but
we
never
say
that
we
give
it
a
degree
of
assent
we
might
as
well
talk
of
degrees
of
truth
as
of
degrees
of
assent
yet
locke
heads
one
of
his
chapters
with
the
title
degrees
of
assent
and
a
writer
of
this
century
who
claims
our
respect
from
the
tone
and
drift
of
his
work
thus
expresses
himself
after
locke
s
manner
moral
evidence
he
says
may
produce
a
variety
of
degrees
of
assents
from
suspicion
to
moral
certainty
for
here
the
degree
of
assent
depends
upon
the
degree
in
which
the
evidence
on
one
side
preponderates
or
exceeds
that
on
the
other
and
as
this
preponderancy
may
vary
almost
infinitely
so
likewise
may
the
degrees
of
assent
for
a
few
of
these
degrees
though
but
for
a
few
names
have
been
invented
thus
when
the
evidence
on
one
side
preponderates
a
very
little
there
is
ground
for
suspicion
or
conjecture
presumption
persuasion
belief
conclusion
conviction
moral
certainty
wavering
distrust
disbelief
words
which
imply
an
increase
or
decrease
of
this
preponderancy
some
of
these
words
also
admit
of
epithets
which
denote
a
further
increase
or
diminution
of
the
assent
can
there
be
a
better
illustration
than
this
passage
supplies
of
what
i
have
been
insisting
on
above
viz
that
in
teaching
various
degrees
of
assent
we
tend
to
destroy
assent
as
an
act
of
the
mind
altogether
this
author
makes
the
degrees
of
assent
infinite
as
the
degrees
of
probability
are
infinite
his
assents
are
really
only
inferences
and
assent
is
a
name
without
a
meaning
the
needless
repetition
of
an
inference
but
in
truth
suspicion
conjecture
presumption
persuasion
belief
conclusion
conviction
moral
certainty
are
not
assents
at
all
they
are
simply
more
or
less
strong
inferences
of
a
proposition
and
doubt
wavering
distrust
disbelief
are
recognitions
more
or
less
strong
of
the
probability
of
its
contradictory
there
is
only
one
sense
in
which
we
are
allowed
to
call
such
acts
or
states
of
mind
assents
they
are
opinions
and
as
being
such
they
are
as
i
have
already
observed
when
speaking
of
opinion
assents
to
the
plausibility
probability
doubtfulness
or
untrustworthiness
of
a
proposition
that
is
not
variations
of
assent
to
an
inference
but
assents
to
a
variation
in
inferences
when
i
assent
to
a
doubtfulness
or
to
a
probability
my
assent
as
such
is
as
complete
as
if
i
assented
to
a
truth
it
is
not
a
certain
degree
of
assent
and
in
like
manner
i
may
be
certain
of
an
uncertainty
that
does
not
destroy
the
specific
notion
convened
in
the
word
i
do
not
know
then
when
it
is
that
we
ever
deliberately
profess
assent
to
a
proposition
without
meaning
to
convey
to
others
the
impression
that
we
accept
it
unreservedly
and
that
because
it
is
true
certainly
we
familiarly
use
such
phrases
as
a
as
we
also
speak
of
but
a
is
not
a
kind
of
assent
any
more
than
a
is
a
kind
of
truth
as
the
object
is
indivisible
so
is
the
act
a
is
a
proposition
which
in
one
aspect
is
a
truth
and
in
another
is
not
to
give
a
is
to
feel
drawn
towards
assent
or
to
assent
one
moment
and
not
the
next
or
to
be
in
the
way
to
assent
to
it
it
means
that
the
proposition
in
question
deserves
a
hearing
that
it
is
probable
or
attractive
that
it
opens
important
views
that
it
is
a
key
to
perplexing
difficulties
or
the
like
treating
the
subject
then
not
according
to
fitness
but
according
to
the
facts
of
human
nature
as
they
are
found
in
the
concrete
action
of
life
i
find
numberless
cases
in
which
we
do
not
assent
at
all
none
in
which
assent
is
evidently
conditional
many
as
i
shall
now
proceed
to
show
in
which
it
is
unconditional
and
these
in
which
admit
of
nothing
higher
than
probable
reasoning
if
human
nature
is
to
be
its
own
witness
there
is
no
medium
between
assenting
and
not
assenting
locke
s
theory
of
the
duty
of
assenting
more
or
less
according
to
degrees
of
evidence
is
invalidated
by
the
testimony
of
high
and
low
young
and
old
ancient
and
modern
as
continually
given
in
their
ordinary
sayings
and
doings
indeed
as
i
have
shown
he
does
not
strictly
maintain
it
himself
yet
though
he
feels
the
claims
of
nature
and
fact
to
be
too
strong
for
him
in
certain
cases
he
gives
no
reason
why
he
should
violate
his
theory
in
these
and
yet
not
in
many
more
now
let
us
review
some
of
those
assents
which
men
give
on
evidence
short
of
intuition
and
demonstration
yet
which
are
as
unconditional
as
if
they
had
that
highest
evidence
first
of
all
starting
from
intuition
of
course
we
all
believe
without
any
doubt
that
we
exist
that
we
have
an
individuality
and
identity
all
our
own
that
we
think
feel
and
act
in
the
home
of
our
own
minds
that
we
have
a
present
sense
of
good
and
evil
of
a
right
and
a
wrong
of
a
true
and
a
false
of
a
beautiful
and
a
hideous
however
we
analyze
our
ideas
of
them
we
have
an
absolute
vision
before
us
of
what
happened
yesterday
or
last
year
so
as
to
be
able
without
any
chance
of
mistake
to
give
evidence
upon
it
in
a
court
of
justice
let
the
consequences
be
ever
so
serious
we
are
sure
that
of
many
things
we
are
ignorant
that
of
many
things
we
are
in
doubt
and
that
of
many
things
we
are
not
in
doubt
nor
is
the
assent
which
we
give
to
facts
limited
to
the
range
of
we
are
sure
beyond
all
hazard
of
a
mistake
that
our
own
self
is
not
the
only
being
existing
that
there
is
an
external
world
that
it
is
a
system
with
parts
and
a
whole
a
universe
carried
on
by
laws
and
that
the
future
is
affected
by
the
past
we
accept
and
hold
with
an
unqualified
assent
that
the
earth
considered
as
a
phenomenon
is
a
globe
that
all
its
regions
see
the
sun
by
turns
that
there
are
vast
tracts
on
it
of
land
and
water
that
there
are
really
existing
cities
on
definite
sites
which
go
by
the
names
of
london
paris
florence
and
madrid
we
are
sure
that
paris
or
london
unless
swallowed
up
by
an
earthquake
or
burned
to
the
ground
is
just
what
it
was
yesterday
when
we
left
it
we
laugh
to
scorn
the
idea
that
we
had
no
parents
though
we
have
no
memory
of
our
birth
that
we
shall
never
depart
this
life
though
we
can
have
no
experience
of
the
future
that
we
are
able
to
live
without
food
though
we
have
never
tried
that
a
world
of
men
did
not
live
before
our
time
or
that
that
world
has
had
no
history
that
there
has
been
no
rise
and
fall
of
states
no
great
men
no
wars
no
revolutions
no
art
no
science
no
literature
no
religion
we
should
be
either
indignant
or
amused
at
the
report
of
our
intimate
friend
being
false
to
us
and
we
are
able
sometimes
without
any
hesitation
to
accuse
certain
parties
of
hostility
and
injustice
to
us
we
may
have
a
deep
consciousness
which
we
never
can
lose
that
we
on
our
part
have
been
cruel
to
others
and
that
they
have
felt
us
to
be
so
or
that
we
have
been
and
have
been
felt
to
be
ungenerous
to
those
who
love
us
we
may
have
an
overpowering
sense
of
our
moral
weakness
of
the
precariousness
of
our
life
health
wealth
position
and
good
fortune
we
may
have
a
clear
view
of
the
weak
points
of
our
physical
constitution
of
what
food
or
medicine
is
good
for
us
and
what
does
us
harm
we
may
be
able
to
master
at
least
in
part
the
course
of
our
past
history
its
our
hits
and
our
great
mistakes
we
may
have
a
sense
of
the
presence
of
a
supreme
being
which
never
has
been
dimmed
by
even
a
passing
shadow
which
has
inhabited
us
ever
since
we
can
recollect
any
thing
and
which
we
can
not
imagine
our
losing
we
may
be
able
for
others
have
been
able
so
to
realize
the
precepts
and
truths
of
christianity
as
deliberately
to
surrender
our
life
rather
than
transgress
the
one
or
to
deny
the
other
on
all
these
truths
we
have
an
immediate
and
an
unhesitating
hold
nor
do
we
think
ourselves
guilty
of
not
loving
truth
for
truth
s
sake
because
we
can
not
reach
them
through
a
series
of
intuitive
propositions
assent
on
reasonings
not
demonstrative
is
too
widely
recognized
an
act
to
be
irrational
unless
man
s
nature
is
irrational
too
familiar
to
the
prudent
and
to
be
an
infirmity
or
an
extravagance
none
of
us
can
think
or
act
without
the
acceptance
of
truths
not
intuitive
not
demonstrated
yet
sovereign
if
our
nature
has
any
constitution
any
laws
one
of
them
is
this
absolute
reception
of
propositions
as
true
which
lie
outside
the
narrow
range
of
conclusions
to
which
logic
formal
or
virtual
is
tethered
nor
has
any
philosophical
theory
the
power
to
force
on
us
a
rule
which
will
not
work
for
a
day
when
then
philosophers
lay
down
principles
on
which
it
follows
that
our
assent
except
when
given
to
objects
of
intuition
or
demonstration
is
conditional
that
the
assent
given
to
propositions
by
minds
necessarily
varies
with
the
proof
producible
for
them
and
that
it
does
not
and
can
not
remain
one
and
the
same
while
the
proof
is
strengthened
or
weakened
they
not
to
be
considered
as
confusing
together
two
things
very
distinct
from
each
other
a
mental
act
or
state
and
a
scientific
rule
an
interior
assent
and
a
set
of
logical
formulas
when
they
speak
of
degrees
of
assent
surely
they
have
no
intention
at
all
of
defining
the
position
of
the
mind
itself
relative
to
the
adoption
of
a
given
conclusion
but
they
mean
to
determine
the
relation
of
that
conclusion
towards
its
premisses
they
are
contemplating
how
representative
symbols
work
not
how
the
intellect
is
affected
towards
the
thing
which
those
symbols
represent
in
real
truth
they
as
little
mean
to
assert
the
principle
of
measuring
our
assents
by
our
logic
as
they
would
fancy
they
could
record
the
refreshment
which
we
receive
from
the
open
air
by
the
readings
of
the
graduated
scale
of
a
thermometer
there
is
a
connexion
doubtless
between
a
logical
conclusion
and
an
assent
as
there
is
between
the
variation
of
the
mercury
and
our
sensations
but
the
mercury
is
not
the
cause
of
life
and
health
nor
is
verbal
argumentation
the
principle
of
inward
belief
if
we
feel
hot
or
chilly
no
one
will
convince
us
to
the
contrary
by
insisting
that
the
glass
is
at
it
is
the
mind
that
reasons
and
assents
not
a
diagram
on
paper
i
may
have
difficulty
in
the
management
of
a
proof
while
i
remain
unshaken
in
my
adherence
to
the
conclusion
supposing
a
boy
can
not
make
his
answer
to
some
arithmetical
or
algebraical
question
tally
with
the
book
need
he
at
once
distrust
the
book
does
his
trust
in
it
fall
down
a
certain
number
of
degrees
according
to
the
force
of
his
difficulty
on
the
contrary
he
keeps
to
the
principle
implicit
but
present
to
his
mind
with
which
he
took
up
the
book
that
the
book
is
more
likely
to
be
right
than
he
is
and
this
mere
preponderance
of
probability
is
sufficient
to
make
him
faithful
to
his
belief
in
its
correctness
till
its
incorrectness
is
actually
proved
my
own
opinion
is
that
the
class
of
writers
of
whom
i
have
been
speaking
have
themselves
as
little
misgiving
about
the
truths
which
they
pretend
to
weigh
out
and
measure
as
their
unsophisticated
neighbours
but
they
think
it
a
duty
to
remind
us
that
since
the
full
etiquette
of
logical
requirements
has
not
been
satisfied
we
must
believe
those
truths
at
our
peril
they
warn
us
that
an
issue
which
can
never
come
to
pass
in
matter
of
fact
is
nevertheless
in
theory
a
possible
supposition
they
do
not
for
instance
intend
for
a
moment
to
imply
that
there
is
even
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
great
britain
is
an
island
but
they
think
we
ought
to
know
if
we
do
not
know
that
there
is
no
proof
of
the
fact
in
mode
and
figure
equal
to
the
proof
of
a
proposition
of
euclid
and
that
in
consequence
they
and
we
are
all
bound
to
suspend
our
judgment
about
such
a
fact
though
it
be
in
an
infinitesimal
degree
lest
we
should
seem
not
to
love
truth
for
truth
s
sake
having
made
their
protest
they
subside
without
scruple
into
that
same
absolute
assurance
of
only
truths
which
is
natural
to
the
illogical
imagination
of
the
multitude
it
remains
to
explain
some
conversational
expressions
at
first
sight
favourable
to
that
doctrine
of
degrees
in
assent
which
i
have
been
combating
we
often
speak
of
giving
a
modified
and
qualified
or
a
presumptive
and
assent
or
as
i
have
already
said
a
to
opinions
or
facts
but
these
expressions
admit
of
an
easy
explanation
assent
upon
the
authority
of
others
is
often
as
i
have
noticed
when
speaking
of
notional
assents
little
more
than
a
profession
or
acquiescence
or
inference
not
a
real
acceptance
of
a
proposition
i
report
for
instance
that
there
was
a
serious
fire
in
the
town
in
the
past
night
and
then
perhaps
i
add
that
at
least
the
morning
papers
say
so
is
i
have
perhaps
no
positive
doubt
of
the
fact
still
by
referring
to
the
newspapers
i
imply
that
i
do
not
take
on
myself
the
responsibility
of
the
statement
in
thus
qualifying
my
apparent
assent
i
show
that
it
was
not
a
genuine
assent
at
all
in
like
manner
a
assent
is
an
assent
to
an
antecedent
probability
of
a
fact
not
to
the
fact
itself
as
i
might
give
a
assent
to
the
plurality
of
worlds
or
to
the
personality
of
homer
without
pledging
myself
to
either
absolutely
of
which
i
spoke
above
is
an
inclination
to
assent
or
again
an
intention
of
assenting
when
certain
difficulties
are
surmounted
when
we
speak
without
thought
assent
has
as
vague
a
meaning
as
but
when
we
deliberately
say
i
assent
we
signify
an
act
of
the
mind
so
definite
as
to
admit
of
no
change
but
that
of
its
ceasing
to
be
and
so
too
though
we
sometimes
use
the
phrase
conditional
assent
yet
we
only
mean
thereby
to
say
that
we
will
assent
under
certain
contingencies
of
course
we
may
if
we
please
include
a
condition
in
the
proposition
to
which
our
assent
is
given
and
then
that
condition
enters
into
the
matter
of
the
assent
but
not
into
the
assent
itself
to
assent
if
this
man
is
in
a
consumption
his
days
are
numbered
as
little
a
conditional
assent
as
to
assent
of
this
consumptive
patient
the
days
are
numbered
though
without
the
conditional
form
is
an
equivalent
proposition
in
such
cases
strictly
speaking
the
assent
is
given
neither
to
antecedent
nor
consequent
of
the
conditional
proposition
but
to
their
connexion
that
is
to
the
enthymematic
if
we
place
the
condition
external
to
the
proposition
then
the
assent
will
be
given
to
that
his
days
are
numbered
is
conditionally
true
and
of
course
we
can
assent
to
the
conditionality
of
a
proposition
as
well
as
to
its
probability
or
again
if
so
be
we
may
give
our
assent
not
only
to
the
in
a
complex
conditional
proposition
but
to
each
of
the
simple
propositions
of
which
it
is
made
up
besides
there
will
be
a
storm
soon
for
the
mercury
falls
besides
assenting
to
the
connexion
of
the
propositions
we
may
assent
also
to
the
mercury
falls
and
to
there
will
be
a
this
is
assenting
to
the
premiss
and
thing
inferred
all
at
once
assent
to
the
whole
syllogism
and
to
its
component
parts
in
like
manner
are
to
be
explained
the
phrases
deliberate
assent
a
rational
assent
a
sudden
impulsive
or
hesitating
assent
these
expressions
denote
not
kinds
or
qualities
but
the
circumstances
of
assenting
a
deliberate
assent
is
an
assent
following
upon
deliberation
it
is
sometimes
called
a
conviction
a
word
which
commonly
includes
in
its
meaning
two
acts
both
the
act
of
inference
and
the
act
of
assent
consequent
upon
the
inference
this
subject
will
be
considered
in
the
next
section
on
the
other
hand
a
hesitating
assent
is
an
assent
to
which
we
have
been
slow
and
intermittent
in
coming
or
an
assent
which
when
given
is
thwarted
and
obscured
by
external
and
flitting
misgivings
though
not
such
as
to
enter
into
the
act
itself
or
essentially
to
damage
it
there
is
another
sense
in
which
we
speak
of
a
hesitating
or
uncertain
assent
viz
when
we
assent
in
act
but
not
in
the
habit
of
our
minds
till
assent
to
a
doctrine
or
fact
is
my
habit
i
am
at
the
mercy
of
inferences
contrary
to
it
i
assent
and
give
up
my
belief
or
incline
to
disbelief
i
may
find
it
my
duty
for
instance
after
the
opportunity
of
careful
inquiry
and
inference
to
assent
to
another
s
innocence
whom
i
have
for
years
considered
guilty
but
from
long
prejudice
i
may
be
unable
to
carry
my
new
assent
well
about
me
and
may
every
now
and
then
relapse
into
momentary
thoughts
injurious
to
him
a
more
plausible
objection
to
the
absolute
absence
of
all
doubt
or
misgiving
in
an
act
of
assent
is
found
in
the
use
of
the
terms
firm
and
weak
assent
or
in
the
growth
of
belief
and
trust
thus
we
assent
to
the
events
of
history
but
not
with
that
fulness
and
force
of
adherence
to
the
received
account
of
them
with
which
we
realize
a
record
of
occurrences
which
are
within
our
own
memory
and
again
we
assent
to
the
praise
bestowed
on
a
friend
s
good
qualities
with
an
energy
which
we
do
not
feel
when
we
are
speaking
of
virtue
in
the
abstract
and
if
we
are
political
partisans
our
assent
is
very
cold
when
we
can
not
refuse
it
to
representations
made
in
favour
of
the
wisdom
or
patriotism
of
statesmen
whom
we
dislike
and
then
as
to
religious
subjects
we
speak
of
strong
faith
and
feeble
faith
of
the
faith
which
would
move
mountains
and
of
the
ordinary
faith
without
which
it
is
impossible
to
please
and
as
we
can
grow
in
graces
so
surely
can
we
inclusively
in
faith
again
we
rise
from
one
work
of
christian
evidences
with
our
faith
enlivened
and
invigorated
from
another
perhaps
with
the
distracted
father
s
words
in
our
mouth
i
believe
help
my
now
it
is
evident
first
of
all
that
habits
of
mind
may
grow
as
being
a
something
permanent
and
continuous
and
by
assent
growing
it
is
often
only
meant
that
the
habit
grows
and
has
greater
hold
upon
the
mind
but
again
when
we
carefully
consider
the
matter
it
will
be
found
that
this
increase
or
decrease
of
strength
does
not
lie
in
the
assent
itself
but
in
its
circumstances
and
concomitants
for
instance
in
the
emotions
in
the
ratiocinative
faculty
or
in
the
imagination
for
instance
as
to
the
emotions
this
strength
of
assent
may
be
nothing
more
than
the
strength
of
love
hatred
interest
desire
or
fear
which
the
object
of
the
assent
elicits
and
this
is
especially
the
case
when
that
object
is
of
a
religious
nature
such
strength
is
adventitious
and
accidental
it
may
come
it
may
go
it
is
found
in
one
man
not
in
another
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
genuineness
and
perfection
of
the
act
of
assent
balaam
assented
to
the
fact
of
his
own
intercourse
with
the
supernatural
as
well
as
moses
but
to
use
religious
language
he
had
light
without
love
his
intellect
was
clear
his
heart
was
cold
hence
his
faith
would
popularly
be
considered
wanting
in
strength
on
the
other
hand
prejudice
implies
strong
assents
to
the
disadvantage
of
its
object
that
is
it
encourages
such
assents
and
guards
them
from
the
chance
of
being
lost
again
when
a
conclusion
is
recommended
to
us
by
the
number
and
force
of
the
arguments
in
proof
of
it
our
recognition
of
them
invests
it
with
a
luminousness
which
in
one
sense
adds
strength
to
our
assent
to
it
as
it
certainly
does
protect
and
embolden
that
assent
thus
we
assent
to
a
review
of
recent
events
which
we
have
studied
from
original
documents
with
a
triumphant
peremptoriness
which
it
neither
occurs
to
us
nor
is
possible
for
us
to
exercise
when
we
make
an
act
of
assent
to
the
assassination
of
julius
caesar
or
to
the
existence
of
the
abipones
though
we
are
as
securely
certain
of
these
latter
facts
as
of
the
doings
and
occurrences
of
yesterday
and
further
all
that
i
have
said
about
the
apprehension
of
propositions
is
in
point
here
we
may
speak
of
assent
to
our
lord
s
divinity
as
strong
or
feeble
according
as
it
is
given
to
the
reality
as
impressed
upon
the
imagination
or
to
the
notion
of
it
as
entertained
by
the
intellect
nor
lastly
does
this
doctrine
of
the
intrinsic
integrity
and
indivisibility
if
i
may
so
speak
of
assent
interfere
with
the
teaching
of
catholic
theology
as
to
the
of
strength
in
divine
faith
which
has
a
supernatural
origin
when
compared
with
all
belief
which
is
merely
human
and
natural
for
first
that
consists
not
in
its
differing
from
human
faith
merely
in
degree
of
assent
but
in
its
being
superior
in
nature
and
kind
so
that
the
one
does
not
admit
of
a
comparison
with
the
other
and
next
its
intrinsic
superiority
is
not
a
matter
of
experience
but
is
above
experience
assent
is
ever
assent
but
in
the
assent
which
follows
on
a
divine
announcement
and
is
vivified
by
a
divine
grace
there
is
from
the
nature
of
the
case
a
transcendant
adhesion
of
mind
intellectual
and
moral
and
a
special
beyond
the
operation
of
those
ordinary
laws
of
thought
which
alone
have
a
place
in
my
discussion
complex
assent
i
have
been
considering
assent
as
the
mental
assertion
of
an
intelligible
proposition
as
an
act
of
the
intellect
direct
absolute
complete
in
itself
unconditional
arbitrary
yet
not
incompatible
with
an
appeal
to
argument
and
at
least
in
many
cases
exercised
unconsciously
on
this
last
characteristic
of
assent
i
have
not
dwelt
as
it
has
not
come
in
my
way
nor
is
it
more
than
an
accident
of
acts
of
assent
though
an
ordinary
accident
that
it
is
of
ordinary
occurrence
can
not
be
doubted
a
great
many
of
our
assents
are
merely
expressions
of
our
personal
likings
tastes
principles
motives
and
opinions
as
dictated
by
nature
or
resulting
from
habit
in
other
words
they
are
acts
and
manifestations
of
self
now
what
is
more
rare
than
in
proportion
then
to
our
ignorance
of
self
is
our
unconsciousness
of
those
innumerable
acts
of
assent
which
we
are
incessantly
making
and
so
again
in
what
may
be
almost
called
the
mechanical
operation
of
our
minds
in
our
continual
acts
of
apprehension
and
inference
speculation
and
resolve
propositions
pass
before
us
and
receive
our
assent
without
our
consciousness
hence
it
is
that
we
are
so
apt
to
confuse
together
acts
of
assent
and
acts
of
inference
indeed
i
may
fairly
say
that
those
assents
which
we
give
with
a
direct
knowledge
of
what
we
are
doing
are
few
compared
with
the
multitude
of
like
acts
which
pass
through
our
minds
in
long
succession
without
our
observing
them
that
mode
of
assent
which
is
exercised
thus
unconsciously
i
may
call
simple
assent
and
of
it
i
have
treated
in
the
foregoing
section
but
now
i
am
going
to
speak
of
such
assents
as
must
be
made
consciously
and
deliberately
and
which
i
shall
call
complex
or
reflex
assents
and
i
begin
by
recalling
what
i
have
already
stated
about
the
relation
in
which
assent
and
inference
stand
to
each
other
which
holds
propositions
conditionally
and
assent
which
unconditionally
accepts
them
the
relation
is
this
acts
of
inference
are
both
the
antecedents
of
assent
before
assenting
and
its
usual
concomitants
after
assenting
for
instance
i
hold
absolutely
that
the
country
which
we
call
india
exists
upon
trustworthy
testimony
and
next
i
may
continue
to
believe
it
on
the
same
testimony
in
like
manner
i
have
ever
believed
that
great
britain
is
an
island
for
certain
sufficient
reasons
and
on
the
same
reasons
i
may
persist
in
the
belief
but
it
may
happen
that
i
forget
my
reasons
for
what
i
believe
to
be
so
absolutely
true
or
i
may
never
have
asked
myself
about
them
or
formally
marshalled
them
in
order
and
have
been
accustomed
to
assent
without
a
recognition
of
my
assent
or
of
its
grounds
and
then
perhaps
something
occurs
which
leads
to
my
reviewing
and
completing
those
grounds
analyzing
and
arranging
them
yet
without
on
that
account
implying
of
necessity
any
suspense
ever
so
slight
of
assent
to
the
proposition
that
india
is
in
a
certain
part
of
the
earth
and
that
great
britain
is
an
island
with
no
suspense
of
assent
at
all
any
more
than
the
boy
in
my
former
illustration
had
any
doubt
about
the
answer
set
down
in
his
when
he
began
working
out
the
question
any
more
than
he
would
be
doubting
his
eyes
and
his
common
sense
that
the
two
sides
of
a
triangle
are
together
greater
than
the
third
because
he
drew
out
the
geometrical
proof
of
it
he
does
but
repeat
after
his
formal
demonstration
that
assent
which
he
made
before
it
and
assents
to
his
previous
assenting
this
is
what
i
call
a
reflex
or
complex
assent
i
say
there
is
no
necessary
incompatibility
between
thus
assenting
and
yet
proving
the
conclusiveness
of
a
proposition
is
not
synonymous
with
its
truth
a
proposition
may
be
true
yet
not
admit
of
being
concluded
may
be
a
conclusion
and
yet
not
a
truth
to
contemplate
it
under
one
aspect
is
not
to
contemplate
it
under
another
and
the
two
aspects
may
be
consistent
from
the
very
fact
that
they
are
two
therefore
to
set
about
concluding
a
proposition
is
not
to
doubt
its
truth
we
may
aim
at
inferring
a
proposition
while
all
the
time
we
assent
to
it
we
have
to
do
this
as
a
common
occurrence
when
we
take
on
ourselves
to
convince
another
on
any
point
in
which
he
differs
from
us
we
do
not
deny
our
faith
because
we
become
controversialists
and
in
like
manner
we
may
employ
ourselves
in
proving
what
we
believe
to
be
true
simply
in
order
to
ascertain
the
producible
evidence
in
its
favour
and
in
order
to
fulfil
what
is
due
to
ourselves
and
to
the
claims
and
responsibilities
of
our
education
and
social
position
i
have
been
speaking
of
investigation
not
of
inquiry
it
is
quite
true
that
inquiry
is
inconsistent
with
assent
but
inquiry
is
something
more
than
the
mere
exercise
of
inference
he
who
inquires
has
not
found
he
is
in
doubt
where
the
truth
lies
and
wishes
his
present
profession
either
proved
or
disproved
we
can
not
without
absurdity
call
ourselves
at
once
believers
and
inquirers
also
thus
it
is
sometimes
spoken
of
as
a
hardship
that
a
catholic
is
not
allowed
to
inquire
into
the
truth
of
his
creed
course
he
can
not
if
he
would
retain
the
name
of
believer
he
can
not
be
both
inside
and
outside
of
the
church
at
once
it
is
merely
common
sense
to
tell
him
that
if
he
is
seeking
he
has
not
found
if
seeking
includes
doubting
and
doubting
excludes
believing
then
the
catholic
who
sets
about
inquiring
thereby
declares
that
he
is
not
a
catholic
he
has
already
lost
faith
and
this
is
his
best
defence
to
himself
for
inquiring
viz
that
he
is
no
longer
a
catholic
and
wishes
to
become
one
they
who
would
forbid
him
to
inquire
would
in
that
case
be
shutting
the
after
the
steed
is
stolen
what
can
he
do
better
than
inquire
if
he
is
in
doubt
how
else
can
he
become
a
catholic
again
not
to
inquire
is
in
his
case
to
be
satisfied
with
disbelief
however
in
thus
speaking
i
am
viewing
the
matter
in
the
abstract
and
without
allowing
for
the
manifold
inconsistencies
of
individuals
as
they
are
found
in
the
world
who
attempt
to
unite
incompatibilities
who
do
not
doubt
but
who
act
as
if
they
did
who
though
they
believe
are
weak
in
faith
and
put
themselves
in
the
way
of
losing
it
by
unnecessarily
listening
to
objections
moreover
there
are
minds
undoubtedly
with
whom
at
all
times
to
question
a
truth
is
to
make
it
questionable
and
to
investigate
is
equivalent
to
inquiring
and
again
there
may
be
beliefs
so
sacred
or
so
delicate
that
if
i
may
use
the
metaphor
they
will
not
wash
without
shrinking
and
losing
colour
i
grant
all
this
but
here
i
am
discussing
broad
principles
not
individual
cases
and
these
principles
are
that
inquiry
implies
doubt
and
that
investigation
does
not
imply
it
and
that
those
who
assent
to
a
doctrine
or
fact
may
without
inconsistency
investigate
its
credibility
though
they
can
not
literally
inquire
about
its
truth
next
i
consider
that
in
the
case
of
educated
minds
investigations
into
the
argumentative
proof
of
the
things
to
which
they
have
given
their
assent
is
an
obligation
or
rather
a
necessity
such
a
trial
of
their
intellects
is
a
law
of
their
nature
like
the
growth
of
childhood
into
manhood
and
analogous
to
the
moral
ordeal
which
is
the
instrument
of
their
spiritual
life
the
lessons
of
right
and
wrong
which
are
taught
them
at
school
are
to
be
carried
out
into
action
amid
the
good
and
evil
of
the
world
and
so
again
the
intellectual
assents
in
which
they
have
in
like
manner
been
instructed
from
the
first
have
to
be
tested
realized
and
developed
by
the
exercise
of
their
mature
judgment
certainly
such
processes
of
investigation
whether
in
religious
subjects
or
secular
often
issue
in
the
reversal
of
the
assents
which
they
were
originally
intended
to
confirm
as
the
boy
who
works
out
an
arithmetical
problem
from
his
book
may
end
in
detecting
or
thinking
he
detects
a
false
print
in
the
answer
but
the
question
before
us
is
whether
acts
of
assent
and
of
inference
are
compatible
and
my
vague
consciousness
of
the
possibility
of
a
reversal
of
my
belief
in
the
course
of
my
researches
as
little
interferes
with
the
honesty
and
firmness
of
that
belief
while
those
researches
proceed
as
the
recognition
of
the
possibility
of
my
train
s
oversetting
is
an
evidence
of
an
intention
on
my
part
of
undergoing
so
great
a
calamity
my
mind
is
not
moved
by
a
scientific
computation
of
chances
nor
can
any
law
of
averages
affect
my
particular
case
to
incur
a
risk
is
not
to
expect
reverse
and
if
my
opinions
are
true
i
have
a
right
to
think
that
they
will
bear
examining
nor
on
the
other
hand
does
belief
viewed
in
its
idea
imply
a
positive
resolution
in
the
party
believing
never
to
abandon
that
belief
what
belief
as
such
does
imply
is
not
an
intention
never
to
change
but
the
utter
absence
of
all
thought
or
expectation
or
fear
of
changing
a
spontaneous
resolution
never
to
change
is
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
belief
for
the
very
force
and
absoluteness
of
the
act
of
assent
precludes
any
such
resolution
we
do
not
commonly
determine
not
to
do
what
we
can
not
fancy
ourselves
ever
doing
we
should
readily
indeed
make
such
a
formal
promise
if
we
were
called
upon
to
do
so
for
since
we
have
the
truth
and
truth
can
not
change
how
can
we
possibly
change
in
our
belief
except
indeed
through
our
own
weakness
or
fickleness
we
have
no
intention
whatever
of
being
weak
or
fickle
so
our
promise
is
but
the
natural
guarantee
of
our
sincerity
it
is
possible
then
without
disloyalty
to
our
convictions
to
examine
their
grounds
even
though
in
the
event
they
are
to
fail
under
the
examination
for
we
have
no
suspicion
of
this
failure
and
such
examination
as
i
have
said
does
but
fulfil
a
law
of
our
nature
our
first
assents
right
or
wrong
are
often
little
more
than
prejudices
the
reasonings
which
precede
and
accompany
them
though
sufficient
for
their
purpose
do
not
rise
up
to
the
importance
and
energy
of
the
assents
themselves
as
time
goes
on
by
degrees
and
without
set
purpose
by
reflection
and
experience
we
begin
to
confirm
or
to
correct
the
notions
and
the
images
to
which
those
assents
are
given
at
times
it
is
a
necessity
formally
to
undertake
a
survey
and
revision
of
this
or
that
class
of
them
of
those
which
relate
to
religion
or
to
social
duty
or
to
politics
or
to
the
conduct
of
life
sometimes
this
review
begins
in
doubt
as
to
the
matters
which
we
propose
to
consider
that
is
in
a
suspension
of
the
assents
hitherto
familiar
to
us
sometimes
those
assents
are
too
strong
to
allow
of
being
lost
on
the
first
stirring
of
the
inquisitive
intellect
and
if
as
time
goes
on
they
give
way
our
change
of
mind
be
it
for
good
or
for
evil
is
owing
to
the
accumulating
force
of
the
arguments
sound
or
unsound
which
bear
down
upon
the
propositions
which
we
have
hitherto
received
objections
indeed
as
such
have
no
direct
force
to
weaken
assent
but
when
they
multiply
they
tell
against
the
implicit
reasonings
or
the
formal
inferences
which
are
its
warrant
and
suspend
its
acts
and
gradually
undermine
its
habit
then
the
assent
goes
but
whether
slowly
or
suddenly
noticeably
or
imperceptibly
is
a
matter
of
circumstance
or
accident
however
whether
the
original
assent
is
continued
on
or
not
the
new
assent
differs
from
the
old
in
this
that
it
has
the
strength
of
explicitness
and
deliberation
that
it
is
not
a
mere
prejudice
and
its
strength
the
strength
of
prejudice
it
is
an
assent
not
only
to
a
given
proposition
but
to
the
claim
of
that
proposition
on
our
assent
as
true
it
is
an
assent
to
an
assent
or
what
is
commonly
called
a
conviction
of
course
these
reflex
acts
may
be
repeated
in
a
series
as
i
pronounce
that
great
britain
is
an
island
and
then
pronounce
that
great
britain
is
an
island
has
a
claim
on
my
assent
or
is
to
be
or
to
be
accepted
as
true
or
to
be
believed
or
simply
is
true
these
predicates
being
equivalent
so
i
may
proceed
the
proposition
that
is
to
be
believed
is
to
be
believed
and
so
on
to
but
this
would
be
trifling
the
mind
is
like
a
double
mirror
in
which
reflexions
of
self
within
self
multiply
themselves
till
they
are
undistinguishable
and
the
first
reflexion
contains
all
the
rest
at
the
same
time
it
is
worth
while
to
notice
two
other
reflex
propositions
that
great
britain
is
an
island
is
probable
is
true
that
great
britain
is
an
island
is
uncertain
is
true
the
former
of
these
is
the
expression
of
opinion
and
the
latter
of
formal
or
theological
doubt
as
i
have
already
determined
i
have
one
step
farther
to
make
the
proposition
to
which
the
assent
is
given
be
as
absolutely
true
as
the
reflex
act
pronounces
it
to
be
that
is
objectively
true
as
well
as
subjectively
the
assent
may
be
called
a
the
conviction
a
the
proposition
or
truth
a
or
thing
known
or
a
matter
of
and
to
assent
to
it
is
to
of
course
in
thus
speaking
i
open
the
question
what
is
truth
and
what
apparent
truth
what
is
genuine
knowledge
and
what
is
its
counterfeit
what
are
the
tests
for
discriminating
certitude
from
mere
persuasion
or
delusion
whatever
a
man
holds
to
be
true
he
will
say
he
holds
for
certain
and
for
the
present
i
must
allow
him
in
his
assumption
hoping
in
one
way
or
another
as
i
proceed
to
lessen
the
difficulties
which
lie
in
the
way
of
calling
him
to
account
for
so
doing
and
i
have
the
less
scruple
in
taking
this
course
as
believing
that
among
fairly
prudent
and
circumspect
men
there
are
far
fewer
instances
of
false
certitude
than
at
first
sight
might
be
supposed
men
are
often
doubtful
about
propositions
which
are
really
true
they
are
not
commonly
certain
of
such
as
are
simply
false
what
they
judge
to
be
a
certainty
is
in
matter
of
fact
for
the
most
part
a
truth
not
that
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
rash
talking
even
among
the
educated
portion
of
the
community
and
many
a
man
makes
professions
of
certitude
for
which
he
has
no
warrant
but
that
such
confident
language
is
no
token
how
these
persons
will
express
themselves
when
brought
to
book
no
one
will
with
justice
consider
himself
certain
of
any
matter
unless
he
has
sufficient
reasons
for
so
considering
and
it
is
rare
that
what
is
not
true
should
be
so
free
from
every
circumstance
and
token
of
falsity
as
to
create
no
suspicion
in
his
mind
to
its
disadvantage
no
reason
for
suspense
of
judgment
however
i
shall
have
to
remark
on
this
difficulty
by
and
by
here
i
will
mention
two
conditions
of
certitude
in
close
connexion
with
that
necessary
preliminary
of
investigation
and
proof
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
which
will
throw
some
light
upon
it
the
one
which
is
or
from
the
nature
of
the
case
will
tell
us
what
is
not
certitude
the
other
which
is
or
from
experience
will
tell
us
in
a
measure
what
certitude
is
certitude
as
i
have
said
is
the
perception
of
a
truth
with
the
perception
that
it
is
a
truth
or
the
consciousness
of
knowing
as
expressed
in
the
phrase
i
know
that
i
know
or
i
know
that
i
know
that
i
know
simply
i
know
for
one
reflex
assertion
of
the
mind
about
self
sums
up
the
series
of
without
the
need
of
any
actual
evolution
of
them
certitude
is
the
knowledge
of
a
truth
what
is
once
true
is
always
true
and
can
not
fail
whereas
what
is
once
known
need
not
always
be
known
and
is
capable
of
failing
it
follows
that
if
i
am
certain
of
a
thing
i
believe
it
will
remain
what
i
now
hold
it
to
be
even
though
my
mind
should
have
the
bad
fortune
to
let
it
drop
since
mere
argument
is
not
the
measure
of
assent
no
one
can
be
called
certain
of
a
proposition
whose
mind
does
not
spontaneously
and
promptly
reject
on
their
first
suggestion
as
idle
as
impertinent
as
sophistical
any
objections
which
are
directed
against
its
truth
no
man
is
certain
of
a
truth
who
can
endure
the
thought
of
the
fact
of
its
contradictory
existing
or
occurring
and
that
not
from
any
set
purpose
or
effort
to
reject
that
thought
but
as
i
have
said
by
the
spontaneous
action
of
the
intellect
what
is
contradictory
to
the
truth
with
its
apparatus
of
argument
fades
out
of
the
mind
as
fast
as
it
enters
it
and
though
it
be
brought
back
to
the
mind
ever
so
often
by
the
pertinacity
of
an
opponent
or
by
a
voluntary
or
involuntary
act
of
imagination
still
that
contradictory
proposition
and
its
arguments
are
mere
phantoms
and
dreams
in
the
light
of
our
certitude
and
their
very
entering
into
the
mind
is
the
first
step
of
their
going
out
of
it
such
is
the
position
of
our
minds
towards
the
heathen
fancy
that
enceladus
lies
under
etna
or
not
to
take
so
extreme
a
case
that
joanna
southcote
was
a
messenger
from
heaven
or
the
emperor
napoleon
really
had
a
star
equal
to
this
peremptory
assertion
of
negative
propositions
is
the
revolt
of
the
mind
from
suppositions
incompatible
with
positive
statements
of
which
we
are
certain
whether
abstract
truths
or
facts
as
that
a
straight
line
is
the
longest
possible
distance
between
its
two
extreme
points
that
great
britain
is
in
shape
an
exact
square
or
circle
that
i
shall
escape
dying
or
that
my
intimate
friend
is
false
to
me
we
may
indeed
say
if
we
please
that
a
man
ought
not
to
have
so
supreme
a
conviction
in
a
given
case
or
in
any
case
whatever
and
that
he
is
therefore
wrong
in
treating
opinions
which
he
does
not
himself
hold
with
this
even
involuntary
contempt
we
have
a
right
to
say
so
if
we
will
but
if
in
matter
of
fact
a
man
has
such
a
conviction
if
he
is
sure
that
ireland
is
to
the
west
of
england
or
that
the
pope
is
the
vicar
of
christ
nothing
is
left
to
him
if
he
would
be
consistent
but
to
carry
his
conviction
out
into
this
magisterial
intolerance
of
any
contrary
assertion
and
if
he
were
in
his
own
mind
tolerant
i
do
not
say
patient
for
patience
and
gentleness
are
moral
duties
but
i
mean
intellectually
tolerant
of
objections
as
objections
he
would
virtually
be
giving
countenance
to
the
views
which
those
objections
represented
i
say
i
certainly
should
be
very
intolerant
of
such
a
notion
as
that
i
shall
one
day
be
emperor
of
the
french
i
should
think
it
too
absurd
even
to
be
ridiculous
and
that
i
must
be
mad
before
i
could
entertain
it
and
did
a
man
try
to
persuade
me
that
treachery
cruelty
or
ingratitude
were
as
praiseworthy
as
honesty
and
temperance
and
that
a
man
who
lived
the
life
of
a
knave
and
died
the
death
of
a
brute
had
nothing
to
fear
from
future
retribution
i
should
think
there
was
no
call
on
me
to
listen
to
his
arguments
except
with
the
hope
of
converting
him
though
he
called
me
a
bigot
and
a
coward
for
refusing
to
inquire
into
his
speculations
and
if
in
a
matter
in
which
my
temporal
interests
were
concerned
he
attempted
to
reconcile
me
to
fraudulent
acts
by
what
he
called
philosophical
views
i
should
say
to
him
retro
satana
and
that
not
from
any
suspicion
of
his
ability
to
reverse
immutable
principles
but
from
a
consciousness
of
my
own
moral
changeableness
and
a
fear
on
that
account
that
i
might
not
be
intellectually
true
to
the
truth
this
then
from
the
nature
of
the
case
is
a
main
characteristic
of
certitude
in
any
matter
to
be
confident
indeed
that
that
certitude
will
last
but
to
be
confident
of
this
also
that
if
it
did
fail
nevertheless
the
thing
itself
whatever
it
is
of
which
we
are
certain
will
remain
just
as
it
is
true
and
irreversible
if
this
be
so
it
is
easy
to
instance
cases
of
an
adherence
to
propositions
which
does
not
fulfil
the
conditions
of
certitude
for
instance
how
positive
and
circumstantial
disputants
may
be
on
both
sides
of
a
question
of
fact
on
which
they
give
their
evidence
till
they
are
called
to
swear
to
it
and
then
how
guarded
and
conditional
their
testimony
becomes
again
how
confident
are
they
in
their
rival
accounts
of
a
transaction
at
which
they
were
present
till
a
third
person
makes
his
appearance
whose
word
will
be
decisive
about
it
then
they
suddenly
drop
their
tone
and
trim
their
statements
and
by
provisos
and
explanations
leave
themselves
loopholes
for
escape
in
case
his
testimony
should
turn
out
to
their
disadvantage
at
first
no
language
could
be
too
bold
or
absolute
to
express
the
distinctness
of
their
knowledge
on
this
side
or
that
but
second
thoughts
are
best
and
their
giving
way
shows
that
their
belief
does
not
come
up
to
the
mark
of
certitude
again
can
we
doubt
that
many
a
confident
expounder
of
scripture
who
is
so
sure
that
paul
meant
this
and
that
john
and
james
did
not
mean
that
would
be
seriously
disconcerted
at
the
presence
of
those
apostles
if
their
presence
were
possible
and
that
they
have
now
an
especial
boldness
of
speech
in
treating
their
subject
because
there
is
no
one
authoritatively
to
set
them
right
if
they
are
wrong
take
another
instance
in
which
the
absence
of
certitude
is
professed
from
the
first
though
it
is
a
matter
of
faith
with
catholics
that
miracles
never
cease
in
the
church
still
that
this
or
that
professed
miracle
really
took
place
is
for
the
most
part
only
a
matter
of
opinion
and
when
it
is
believed
whether
on
testimony
or
tradition
it
is
not
believed
to
the
exclusion
of
all
doubt
whether
about
the
fact
or
its
miraculousness
thus
i
may
believe
in
the
liquefaction
of
pantaleon
s
blood
and
believe
it
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
to
be
a
miracle
yet
supposing
a
chemist
offered
to
produce
exactly
the
same
phenomena
under
exactly
similar
circumstances
by
the
materials
put
at
his
command
by
his
science
so
as
to
reduce
what
seemed
beyond
nature
within
natural
laws
i
should
watch
with
some
suspense
of
mind
and
misgiving
the
course
of
his
experiment
as
having
no
divine
word
to
fall
back
upon
as
a
ground
of
certainty
that
the
liquefaction
was
miraculous
take
another
virtual
exhibition
of
fear
i
mean
irritation
and
impatience
of
contradiction
vehemence
of
assertion
determination
to
silence
others
are
the
tokens
of
a
mind
which
has
not
yet
attained
the
tranquil
enjoyment
of
certitude
no
one
i
suppose
would
say
that
he
was
certain
of
the
plurality
of
worlds
that
uncertitude
on
the
subject
is
just
the
explanation
and
the
only
explanation
satisfactory
to
my
mind
of
the
strange
violence
of
language
which
has
before
now
dishonoured
the
philosophical
controversy
upon
it
those
who
are
certain
of
a
fact
are
indolent
disputants
it
is
enough
for
them
that
they
have
the
truth
and
they
have
little
disposition
except
at
the
call
of
duty
to
criticize
the
hallucinations
of
others
and
much
less
are
they
angry
at
their
positiveness
or
ingenuity
in
argument
but
to
call
names
to
impute
motives
to
accuse
of
sophistry
to
be
impetuous
and
overbearing
is
the
part
of
men
who
are
alarmed
for
their
own
position
and
fear
to
have
it
approached
too
nearly
and
in
like
manner
the
intemperance
of
language
and
of
thought
which
is
sometimes
found
in
converts
to
a
religious
creed
is
often
attributed
not
without
plausibility
even
though
erroneously
in
the
particular
case
to
some
flaw
in
the
completeness
of
their
certitude
which
interferes
with
the
harmony
and
repose
of
their
convictions
again
this
intellectual
anxiety
which
is
incompatible
with
certitude
shows
itself
in
our
running
back
in
our
minds
to
the
arguments
on
which
we
came
to
believe
in
not
letting
our
conclusions
alone
in
going
over
and
strengthening
the
evidence
and
as
it
were
getting
it
by
heart
as
if
our
highest
assent
were
only
an
inference
and
such
too
is
our
unnecessarily
declaring
that
we
are
certain
as
if
to
reassure
ourselves
and
our
appealing
to
others
for
their
suffrage
in
behalf
of
the
truths
of
which
we
are
so
sure
which
is
like
our
asking
another
whether
we
are
weary
and
hungry
or
have
eaten
and
drunk
to
our
satisfaction
all
laws
are
general
none
are
invariable
i
am
not
writing
as
a
moralist
or
casuist
it
must
ever
be
recollected
that
these
various
phenomena
of
mind
though
signs
are
not
infallible
signs
of
uncertitude
they
may
proceed
in
the
particular
case
from
other
circumstances
such
anxieties
and
alarms
may
be
merely
emotional
and
from
the
imagination
not
intellectual
parallel
to
the
beating
of
the
heart
nay
as
i
have
been
told
the
trembling
of
the
limbs
of
even
the
bravest
men
before
a
battle
when
standing
still
to
receive
the
first
attack
of
the
enemy
such
too
is
that
palpitating
that
trouble
of
the
mind
lest
it
should
not
believe
strongly
enough
which
and
not
doubt
underlies
the
sensitiveness
described
in
the
lines
with
eyes
too
tremblingly
awake
to
bear
with
dimness
for
his
and
so
again
a
man
s
in
argument
may
arise
from
zeal
or
charity
his
impatience
from
loyalty
to
the
truth
his
extravagance
from
want
of
taste
from
enthusiasm
or
from
youthful
ardour
and
his
restless
recurrence
to
argument
not
from
personal
disquiet
but
from
a
vivid
appreciation
of
the
controversial
talent
of
an
opponent
or
of
his
own
or
of
the
mere
philosophical
difficulties
of
the
subject
in
dispute
these
are
points
for
the
consideration
of
those
who
are
concerned
in
registering
and
explaining
what
may
be
called
the
meteorological
phenomena
of
the
human
mind
and
do
not
interfere
with
the
broad
principle
which
i
would
lay
down
that
to
fear
argument
is
to
doubt
the
conclusion
and
to
be
certain
of
a
truth
is
to
be
careless
of
objections
to
it
with
the
practical
rule
that
mere
assent
is
not
certitude
and
must
not
be
confused
with
it
now
to
consider
what
certitude
positively
is
as
a
matter
of
experience
it
is
accompanied
as
a
state
of
mind
by
a
specific
feeling
proper
to
it
and
discriminating
it
from
other
states
intellectual
and
moral
i
do
not
say
as
its
practical
test
or
as
its
but
as
its
token
and
in
a
certain
sense
its
form
when
a
man
says
he
is
certain
he
means
he
is
conscious
to
himself
of
having
this
specific
feeling
it
is
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
and
of
intellectual
security
arising
out
of
a
sense
of
success
attainment
possession
finality
as
regards
the
matter
which
has
been
in
question
as
a
conscientious
deed
is
attended
by
a
which
nothing
but
itself
can
create
so
certitude
is
united
to
a
sentiment
in
which
it
lives
and
is
manifested
these
two
parallel
sentiments
indeed
have
no
relationship
with
each
other
the
enjoyable
of
certitude
being
as
foreign
to
a
good
deed
as
the
glow
of
conscience
is
to
the
perception
of
a
truth
yet
knowledge
as
well
as
virtue
is
an
end
and
both
knowledge
and
virtue
when
reflected
on
carry
with
them
respectively
their
own
reward
in
the
characteristic
sentiment
which
as
i
have
said
is
proper
to
each
and
as
the
performance
of
what
is
right
is
distinguished
by
this
religious
peace
so
the
attainment
of
what
is
true
is
attested
by
this
intellectual
security
and
as
the
feeling
of
which
is
proper
to
good
conduct
does
not
belong
to
the
sense
or
to
the
possession
of
the
beautiful
or
of
the
becoming
of
the
pleasant
or
of
the
useful
so
neither
is
the
special
relaxation
and
repose
of
mind
which
is
the
token
of
certitude
ever
found
to
attend
upon
simple
assent
on
processes
of
inference
or
on
doubt
nor
on
investigation
conjecture
opinion
as
such
or
on
any
other
state
or
action
of
mind
besides
certitude
on
the
contrary
those
acts
and
states
of
mind
have
gratifications
proper
to
themselves
and
unlike
that
of
certitude
as
will
sufficiently
appear
on
considering
them
separately
philosophers
are
fond
of
enlarging
on
the
pleasures
of
knowledge
that
is
knowledge
as
such
nor
need
i
here
prove
that
such
pleasures
exist
but
the
repose
in
self
and
in
its
object
as
connected
with
self
which
i
attribute
to
certitude
does
not
attach
to
mere
knowing
that
is
to
the
perception
of
things
but
to
the
consciousness
of
having
that
knowledge
the
simple
and
direct
perception
of
things
has
its
own
great
satisfaction
but
it
must
recognize
them
as
realities
and
recognize
them
as
known
before
it
becomes
the
perception
and
has
the
satisfaction
of
certitude
indeed
as
far
as
i
see
the
pleasure
of
perceiving
truth
without
reflecting
on
it
as
truth
is
not
very
different
except
in
intensity
and
in
dignity
from
the
pleasure
as
such
of
assent
or
belief
given
to
what
is
not
true
nay
from
the
pleasure
of
the
mere
passive
reception
of
recitals
or
narratives
which
neither
profess
to
be
true
nor
claim
to
be
believed
representations
of
any
kind
are
in
their
own
nature
pleasurable
whether
they
be
true
or
not
whether
they
come
to
us
or
do
not
come
as
true
we
read
a
history
or
a
biographical
notice
with
pleasure
and
we
read
a
romance
with
pleasure
and
a
pleasure
which
is
quite
apart
from
the
question
of
fact
or
fiction
indeed
when
we
would
persuade
young
people
to
read
history
we
tell
them
that
it
is
as
interesting
as
a
romance
or
a
novel
the
mere
acquisition
of
new
images
and
those
images
striking
great
various
unexpected
beautiful
with
mutual
relations
and
bearings
as
being
parts
of
a
whole
with
continuity
succession
evolution
with
recurring
complications
and
corresponding
solutions
with
a
crisis
and
a
catastrophe
is
highly
pleasurable
quite
independently
of
the
question
whether
there
is
any
truth
in
them
i
am
not
denying
that
we
should
be
baulked
and
disappointed
to
be
told
they
were
all
untrue
but
this
seems
to
arise
from
the
reflection
that
we
have
been
taken
in
not
as
if
the
fact
of
their
truth
were
a
distinct
element
of
pleasure
though
it
would
increase
the
pleasure
as
investing
them
with
a
character
of
marvellousness
and
as
associating
them
with
known
or
ascertained
places
but
even
if
the
pleasure
of
knowledge
is
not
thus
founded
on
the
imagination
at
least
it
does
not
consist
in
that
triumphant
repose
of
the
mind
after
a
struggle
which
is
the
characteristic
of
certitude
and
so
too
as
to
such
statements
as
gain
from
us
a
as
superstitious
tales
stories
of
magic
of
romantic
crime
of
ghosts
or
such
as
we
follow
for
the
moment
with
a
faint
and
languid
assent
history
political
occurrences
the
news
of
the
day
pleasure
resulting
from
these
is
that
of
novelty
or
curiosity
and
is
like
the
pleasure
arising
from
the
excitement
of
chance
and
from
variety
it
has
in
it
no
sense
of
possession
it
is
simply
external
to
us
and
has
nothing
akin
to
the
thought
of
a
battle
and
a
victory
again
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
has
its
own
pleasure
distinct
from
the
pleasures
of
knowledge
as
it
is
distinct
from
that
of
consciously
possessing
it
this
will
be
evident
at
once
if
we
consider
what
a
vacuity
and
depression
of
mind
sometimes
comes
upon
us
on
the
termination
of
an
inquiry
however
successfully
terminated
compared
with
the
interest
and
spirit
with
which
we
carried
it
on
the
pleasure
of
a
search
like
that
of
a
hunt
lies
in
the
searching
and
ends
at
the
point
at
which
the
pleasure
of
certitude
begins
its
elements
are
altogether
foreign
to
those
which
go
to
compose
the
serene
satisfaction
of
certitude
first
the
successive
steps
of
discovery
which
attend
on
an
investigation
are
continual
and
informations
and
pleasurable
not
only
as
such
but
also
as
the
evidence
of
past
efforts
and
the
earnest
of
success
at
the
last
next
there
is
the
interest
which
attaches
to
a
mystery
not
yet
removed
but
tending
to
removal
complex
pleasure
of
wonder
expectation
sudden
surprises
suspense
and
hope
of
advances
fitful
yet
sure
to
the
unknown
and
there
is
the
pleasure
which
attaches
to
the
toil
and
conflict
of
the
strong
the
consciousness
and
successive
evidences
of
power
moral
and
intellectual
the
pride
of
ingenuity
and
skill
of
industry
patience
vigilance
and
perseverance
such
are
the
pleasures
of
investigation
and
discovery
and
to
these
we
must
add
what
i
have
suggested
in
the
last
sentence
the
logical
satisfaction
as
it
may
be
called
which
accompanies
these
efforts
of
mind
there
is
great
pleasure
as
is
plain
at
least
to
certain
minds
in
proceeding
from
particular
facts
to
principles
in
generalizing
discriminating
reducing
into
order
and
meaning
the
maze
of
phenomena
which
nature
presents
to
us
this
is
the
kind
of
pleasure
attendant
on
the
treatment
of
probabilities
which
point
at
conclusions
without
reaching
them
or
of
objections
which
must
be
weighed
and
measured
and
adjusted
for
what
they
are
worth
over
and
against
propositions
which
are
antecedently
evident
it
is
the
special
pleasure
belonging
to
inference
as
contrasted
with
assent
a
pleasure
almost
poetical
as
twilight
has
more
poetry
in
it
than
such
is
the
joy
of
the
pleader
with
a
good
case
in
hand
and
expecting
the
separate
attacks
of
half
a
dozen
acute
intellects
each
advancing
from
a
point
of
his
own
i
suppose
this
was
the
pleasure
which
the
academics
had
in
mind
when
they
propounded
that
happiness
lay
not
in
finding
the
truth
but
in
seeking
it
to
seek
indeed
with
the
certainty
of
not
finding
what
we
seek
can
not
in
any
serious
matter
be
pleasurable
any
more
than
the
labour
of
sisyphus
or
the
danaides
but
when
the
result
does
not
concern
us
very
much
clever
arguments
and
rival
ones
have
the
attraction
of
a
game
of
chance
or
skill
whether
or
not
they
lead
to
any
definite
conclusion
are
there
pleasures
of
doubt
as
well
as
of
inference
and
of
assent
in
one
sense
there
are
not
indeed
if
doubt
simply
means
ignorance
uncertainty
or
hopeless
suspense
but
there
is
a
certain
grave
acquiescence
in
ignorance
a
recognition
of
our
impotence
to
solve
momentous
and
urgent
questions
which
has
a
satisfaction
of
its
own
after
high
aspirations
after
renewed
endeavours
after
bootless
toil
after
long
wanderings
after
hope
effort
weariness
failure
painfully
alternating
and
recurring
it
is
an
immense
relief
to
the
exhausted
mind
to
be
able
to
say
at
length
i
know
that
i
can
know
nothing
about
any
thing
is
while
it
can
maintain
itself
in
a
posture
of
thought
which
has
no
promise
of
permanence
because
it
is
unnatural
but
here
the
satisfaction
does
not
lie
in
not
knowing
but
in
knowing
there
is
nothing
to
know
it
is
a
positive
act
of
assent
or
conviction
given
to
what
in
the
particular
case
is
an
untruth
it
is
the
assent
and
the
false
certitude
which
are
the
cause
of
the
tranquillity
of
mind
ignorance
remains
the
evil
which
it
ever
was
but
something
of
the
peace
of
certitude
is
gained
in
knowing
the
worst
and
in
having
reconciled
the
mind
to
the
endurance
of
it
i
may
seem
to
have
been
needlessly
diffuse
in
thus
dwelling
on
the
pleasurable
affections
severally
attending
on
these
various
conditions
of
the
intellect
but
i
have
had
a
purpose
in
doing
so
that
certitude
is
a
natural
and
normal
state
of
mind
and
not
as
is
sometimes
objected
one
of
its
extravagances
or
infirmities
is
proved
indeed
by
the
remarks
which
i
have
made
above
on
the
same
objection
as
directed
against
assent
for
certitude
is
only
one
of
its
forms
but
i
have
thought
it
well
in
addition
to
suggest
even
at
the
expense
of
a
digression
that
as
no
one
would
refuse
to
inquiry
doubt
and
knowledge
a
legitimate
place
among
our
mental
constituents
so
no
one
can
reasonably
ignore
a
state
of
mind
which
not
only
is
shown
to
be
substantive
by
possessing
a
sentiment
and
characteristic
but
is
analogical
to
inquiry
doubt
and
knowledge
in
the
fact
of
its
thus
having
a
sentiment
of
its
own
chapter
vii
certitude
assent
and
certitude
contrasted
in
proceeding
to
compare
together
simple
assent
and
complex
that
is
assent
and
certitude
i
begin
by
observing
that
popularly
no
distinction
is
made
between
the
two
or
rather
that
in
religious
teaching
that
is
called
certitude
to
which
i
have
given
the
name
of
assent
i
have
no
difficulty
in
adopting
such
a
use
of
the
words
though
the
course
of
my
investigation
has
led
me
to
another
perhaps
religious
assent
may
be
fitly
called
to
use
a
theological
term
material
certitude
and
the
first
point
of
comparison
which
i
shall
make
between
the
two
states
of
mind
will
serve
to
set
me
right
with
the
common
way
of
speaking
it
certainly
follows
then
from
the
distinctions
which
i
have
made
that
great
numbers
of
men
must
be
considered
to
pass
through
life
with
neither
doubt
nor
on
the
other
hand
certitude
as
i
have
used
the
words
on
the
most
important
propositions
which
can
occupy
their
minds
but
with
only
a
simple
assent
that
is
an
assent
which
they
barely
recognize
or
bring
home
to
their
consciousness
or
reflect
upon
as
being
assent
such
an
assent
is
all
that
religious
protestants
commonly
have
to
show
who
believe
nevertheless
with
their
whole
hearts
the
contents
of
holy
scripture
such
too
is
the
state
of
mind
of
multitudes
of
good
catholics
perhaps
the
majority
who
live
and
die
in
a
simple
full
firm
belief
in
all
that
the
church
teaches
because
she
teaches
it
the
belief
of
the
irreversible
truth
of
whatever
she
defines
and
declares
who
as
being
far
removed
from
protestant
and
other
dissentients
and
having
but
little
intellectual
training
have
never
had
the
temptation
to
doubt
and
never
the
opportunity
to
be
certain
there
were
whole
nations
in
the
middle
ages
thus
steeped
in
the
catholic
faith
who
never
used
its
doctrines
as
matter
for
argument
or
research
or
changed
the
original
belief
of
their
childhood
into
the
more
scientific
convictions
of
philosophy
as
there
is
a
condition
of
mind
which
is
characterized
by
invincible
ignorance
so
there
is
another
which
may
be
said
to
be
possessed
of
invincible
knowledge
and
it
would
be
paradoxical
in
me
to
deny
to
such
a
mental
state
the
highest
quality
of
religious
faith
mean
certitude
i
allow
this
and
therefore
i
will
call
simple
assent
certitude
or
to
use
a
still
more
apposite
term
for
it
certitude
i
call
it
interpretative
signifying
thereby
that
though
the
assent
in
the
individuals
contemplated
is
not
a
reflex
act
still
the
question
only
has
to
be
started
about
the
truth
of
the
objects
of
their
assent
in
order
to
elicit
from
them
an
act
of
faith
in
response
which
will
fulfil
the
conditions
of
certitude
as
i
have
drawn
them
out
as
to
the
argumentative
process
necessary
for
such
an
act
it
is
valid
and
sufficient
if
it
be
carried
out
seriously
and
proportionate
to
their
several
capacities
the
catholic
religion
is
true
because
its
objects
as
present
to
my
mind
control
and
influence
my
conduct
as
nothing
else
does
or
because
it
has
about
it
an
odour
of
truth
and
sanctity
as
perceptible
to
my
moral
nature
as
flowers
to
my
sense
such
as
can
only
come
from
heaven
or
because
it
has
never
been
to
me
any
thing
but
peace
joy
consolation
and
strength
all
through
my
troubled
and
if
the
particular
argument
used
in
some
instances
needs
strengthening
then
let
it
be
observed
that
the
keenness
of
the
real
apprehension
with
which
the
assent
is
made
though
it
can
not
be
the
legitimate
basis
of
the
assent
may
still
legitimately
act
and
strongly
act
in
confirmation
such
i
say
would
be
the
promptitude
and
effectiveness
of
the
reasoning
and
the
facility
of
the
change
from
assent
to
certitude
proper
in
the
case
of
the
multitudes
in
question
did
the
occasion
for
reflection
occur
but
it
does
not
occur
and
accordingly
most
genuine
and
thorough
as
is
the
assent
it
can
only
be
called
virtual
material
or
interpretative
certitude
if
i
have
above
explained
certitude
rightly
of
course
these
remarks
hold
good
in
secular
subjects
as
well
as
religious
believe
for
instance
that
i
am
living
in
an
island
that
julius
cæsar
once
invaded
it
that
it
has
been
conquered
by
successive
races
that
it
has
had
great
political
and
social
changes
and
that
at
this
time
it
has
colonies
establishments
and
imperial
dominion
all
over
the
earth
all
this
i
am
accustomed
to
take
for
granted
without
a
thought
but
were
the
need
to
arise
i
should
not
find
much
difficulty
in
drawing
out
from
my
own
mental
resources
reasons
sufficient
to
justify
me
in
these
beliefs
it
is
true
indeed
that
among
the
multitudes
who
are
thus
implicitly
certain
there
may
be
those
who
would
change
their
assents
did
they
seek
to
place
them
upon
an
argumentative
footing
for
instance
some
believers
in
christianity
did
they
examine
into
its
claims
might
end
in
renouncing
it
but
this
is
only
saying
that
there
are
genuine
assents
and
assents
that
ultimately
prove
to
be
not
genuine
and
again
that
there
is
an
assent
which
is
not
a
virtual
certitude
and
is
lost
in
the
attempt
to
make
it
certitude
and
of
course
we
are
not
gifted
with
that
insight
into
the
minds
of
individuals
which
enables
us
to
determine
before
the
event
when
it
is
that
an
assent
is
really
such
and
when
not
or
not
a
deeply
rooted
assent
men
may
assent
lightly
or
from
mere
prejudice
or
without
understanding
what
it
is
to
which
they
assent
they
may
be
genuine
believers
in
revelation
up
to
the
time
when
they
begin
formally
to
examine
and
really
have
implicit
reasons
for
their
belief
then
being
overcome
by
the
number
of
views
which
they
have
to
confront
and
swayed
by
the
urgency
of
special
objections
or
biassed
by
their
imaginations
or
frightened
by
a
deeper
insight
into
the
claims
of
religion
upon
the
soul
may
in
spite
of
their
habitual
and
latent
grounds
for
believing
shrink
back
and
withdraw
their
assent
or
again
they
may
once
have
believed
but
their
assent
has
gradually
become
a
mere
profession
without
their
knowing
it
then
when
by
accident
they
interrogate
themselves
they
find
no
assent
within
them
at
all
to
turn
into
certitude
the
event
i
say
alone
determines
whether
what
is
outwardly
an
assent
is
really
such
an
act
of
the
mind
as
admits
of
being
developed
into
certitude
or
is
a
mere
or
a
cloak
for
unbelief
next
i
observe
that
of
the
two
modes
of
apprehending
propositions
notional
and
real
assent
as
i
have
already
said
has
closer
relations
with
real
than
with
notional
now
a
simple
assent
need
not
be
notional
but
the
reflex
or
confirmatory
assent
of
certitude
always
is
given
to
a
notional
proposition
viz
to
the
truth
necessity
duty
of
our
assent
to
the
simple
assent
and
to
its
proposition
its
predicate
is
a
general
term
and
can
not
stand
for
a
fact
whereas
the
original
proposition
included
in
it
may
and
often
does
express
a
fact
thus
the
cholera
is
in
the
midst
of
us
is
a
real
proposition
but
that
the
cholera
is
in
the
midst
of
us
is
beyond
all
doubt
is
a
notional
now
assent
to
a
real
proposition
is
assent
to
an
imagination
and
an
imagination
as
supplying
objects
to
our
emotional
and
moral
nature
is
adapted
to
be
a
principle
of
action
accordingly
the
simple
assent
to
the
cholera
is
among
us
is
more
emphatic
and
operative
than
the
confirmatory
assent
it
is
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
cholera
is
among
the
confirmation
gives
momentum
to
the
complex
act
of
the
mind
but
the
simple
assent
gives
it
its
edge
the
simple
assent
would
still
be
operative
in
its
measure
though
the
reflex
assent
was
not
it
is
undeniable
but
it
is
probable
that
the
cholera
is
among
us
whereas
there
would
be
no
operative
force
in
the
mental
act
at
all
though
the
reflex
assent
was
to
the
truth
not
to
the
probability
of
the
fact
if
the
fact
which
was
the
object
of
the
simple
assent
was
nothing
more
than
the
cholera
is
in
the
reflex
assent
then
which
is
the
characteristic
of
certitude
does
not
immediately
touch
us
it
is
purely
intellectual
and
taken
by
itself
has
scarcely
more
force
than
the
recording
of
a
conclusion
i
have
taken
an
instance
in
which
the
matter
which
is
submitted
for
examination
and
for
assent
can
hardly
fail
of
being
interesting
to
the
minds
employed
upon
it
but
in
many
cases
even
though
the
fact
has
a
bearing
upon
action
it
is
not
directly
of
a
nature
to
influence
the
feelings
or
conduct
except
of
particular
persons
and
in
such
instances
of
certitude
the
previous
labour
of
coming
to
a
conclusion
and
that
repose
of
mind
which
i
have
above
described
as
attendant
on
an
assent
to
its
truth
often
counteracts
whatever
of
lively
sensation
the
fact
thus
concluded
is
in
itself
adapted
to
excite
so
that
what
is
gained
in
depth
and
exactness
of
belief
is
lost
as
regards
freshness
and
vigour
hence
it
is
that
literary
or
scientific
men
who
may
have
investigated
some
difficult
point
of
history
philosophy
or
physics
and
have
come
to
their
own
settled
conclusion
about
it
having
had
a
perfect
right
to
form
one
are
far
more
disposed
to
be
silent
as
to
their
convictions
and
to
let
others
alone
than
partisans
on
either
side
of
the
question
who
take
it
up
with
less
thought
and
seriousness
and
so
again
in
the
religious
world
no
one
seems
to
look
for
any
great
devotion
or
fervour
in
controversialists
writers
on
christian
evidences
theologians
and
the
like
it
being
taken
for
granted
rightly
or
wrongly
that
such
men
are
too
intellectual
to
be
spiritual
and
are
more
occupied
with
the
truth
of
doctrine
than
with
its
reality
if
on
the
other
hand
we
would
see
what
the
force
of
simple
assent
can
be
viewed
apart
from
its
reflex
confirmation
we
have
but
to
look
at
the
generous
and
uncalculating
energy
of
faith
as
exemplified
in
the
primitive
martyrs
in
the
youths
who
defied
the
pagan
tyrant
or
the
maidens
who
were
silent
under
his
tortures
it
is
assent
pure
and
simple
which
is
the
motive
cause
of
great
achievements
it
is
a
confidence
growing
out
of
instincts
rather
than
arguments
stayed
upon
a
vivid
apprehension
and
animated
by
a
transcendent
logic
more
concentrated
in
will
and
in
deed
for
the
very
reason
that
it
has
not
been
subjected
to
any
intellectual
development
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
in
thus
speaking
i
am
contrasting
with
each
other
the
simple
and
the
reflex
assent
which
together
make
up
the
complex
act
of
certitude
in
its
complete
exhibition
keenness
in
believing
is
united
with
repose
and
persistence
we
must
take
the
constitution
of
the
human
mind
as
we
find
it
and
not
as
we
may
judge
it
ought
to
be
i
am
led
on
to
another
remark
which
is
at
first
sight
disadvantageous
to
certitude
introspection
of
our
intellectual
operations
is
not
the
best
of
means
for
preserving
us
from
intellectual
hesitations
to
meddle
with
the
springs
of
thought
and
action
is
really
to
weaken
them
and
as
to
that
argumentation
which
is
the
preliminary
to
certitude
it
may
indeed
be
unavoidable
but
as
in
the
case
of
other
serviceable
allies
it
is
not
so
easy
to
discard
it
after
it
has
done
its
work
as
it
was
in
the
first
instance
to
obtain
its
assistance
questioning
when
encouraged
on
any
readily
becomes
a
habit
and
leads
the
mind
to
substitute
exercises
of
inference
for
assent
whether
simple
or
complex
reasons
for
assenting
suggest
reasons
for
not
assenting
and
what
were
realities
to
our
imagination
while
our
assent
was
simple
may
become
little
more
than
notions
when
we
have
attained
to
certitude
objections
and
difficulties
tell
upon
the
mind
it
may
lose
its
elasticity
and
be
unable
to
throw
them
off
and
thus
even
as
regards
things
which
it
may
be
absurd
to
doubt
we
may
in
consequence
of
some
past
suggestion
of
the
possibility
of
error
or
of
some
chance
association
to
their
disadvantage
be
teazed
from
time
to
time
and
hampered
by
involuntary
questionings
as
if
we
were
not
certain
when
we
are
nay
there
are
those
who
are
visited
with
these
even
permanently
as
a
sort
of
of
their
mental
vision
ever
flitting
to
and
fro
and
dimming
its
clearness
and
for
which
they
are
not
responsible
and
which
they
know
to
be
unreal
still
so
seriously
interfering
with
their
comfort
and
even
with
their
energy
that
they
may
be
tempted
to
complain
that
even
blind
prejudice
has
more
of
quiet
and
of
durability
than
certitude
as
even
saints
may
suffer
from
imaginations
in
which
they
have
no
part
so
the
shreds
and
tatters
of
former
controversies
and
the
litter
of
an
argumentative
habit
may
beset
and
obstruct
the
intellect
which
have
been
solved
without
their
solutions
chains
of
reasoning
with
missing
links
difficulties
which
have
their
roots
in
the
nature
of
things
and
which
are
necessarily
left
behind
in
a
philosophical
inquiry
because
they
can
not
be
removed
and
which
call
for
the
exercise
of
good
sense
and
for
strength
of
will
to
put
them
down
with
a
high
hand
as
irrational
or
preposterous
whence
comes
evil
why
are
we
created
without
our
consent
how
can
the
supreme
being
have
no
beginning
how
can
he
need
skill
if
he
is
omnipotent
if
he
is
omnipotent
why
does
he
permit
suffering
if
he
permits
suffering
how
is
he
if
he
is
how
can
he
be
just
if
he
is
infinite
what
has
he
to
do
with
the
finite
how
can
the
temporary
be
decisive
of
the
eternal
and
a
host
of
like
questions
must
arise
in
every
thoughtful
mind
and
after
the
best
use
of
reason
must
be
deliberately
put
aside
as
beyond
reason
as
so
to
speak
which
having
no
outlet
themselves
have
no
legitimate
power
to
divert
us
from
the
king
s
highway
and
to
hinder
the
direct
course
of
religious
inquiry
from
reaching
its
destination
a
serious
obstruction
however
they
will
be
now
and
then
to
particular
minds
enfeebling
the
faith
which
they
can
not
destroy
parallel
to
the
uncomfortable
associations
with
which
sometimes
we
regard
one
whom
we
have
with
acquaintance
or
stranger
arising
from
some
chance
word
look
or
action
of
his
which
we
have
witnessed
and
which
prejudices
him
in
our
imagination
though
we
are
angry
with
ourselves
that
it
should
do
so
again
when
in
confidence
of
our
own
certitude
and
with
a
view
to
philosophical
fairness
we
have
attempted
successfully
to
throw
ourselves
out
of
our
habits
of
belief
into
a
simply
dispassionate
frame
of
mind
then
vague
antecedent
improbabilities
or
what
seem
to
us
as
such
what
is
strange
or
marvellous
in
certain
truths
merely
the
fact
that
things
happen
in
one
way
and
not
in
another
when
they
must
happen
in
some
way
disturb
us
as
suggesting
to
us
is
it
possible
who
would
have
thought
it
what
a
coincidence
without
really
touching
the
deep
assent
of
our
whole
intellectual
being
to
the
object
whatever
it
be
thus
irrationally
assailed
thus
we
may
wonder
at
the
divine
mercy
of
the
incarnation
till
we
grow
startled
at
it
and
ask
why
the
earth
has
so
special
a
theological
history
or
why
we
are
christians
and
others
not
or
how
god
can
really
exert
a
particular
governance
since
he
does
not
punish
such
sinners
as
we
are
thus
seeming
to
doubt
his
power
or
his
equity
though
in
truth
we
are
not
doubting
at
all
the
occasion
of
this
intellectual
waywardness
may
be
slighter
still
i
gaze
on
the
palatine
hill
or
on
the
parthenon
or
on
the
pyramids
which
i
have
read
of
from
a
boy
or
upon
the
reality
of
the
sacred
places
in
the
holy
land
and
i
have
to
force
my
imagination
to
follow
the
guidance
of
sight
and
of
reason
it
is
to
me
so
strange
that
a
lifelong
belief
should
be
changed
into
sight
and
things
should
be
so
near
me
which
hitherto
had
been
visions
and
so
in
times
first
of
suspense
then
of
joy
when
the
lord
turned
the
captivity
of
sion
then
according
to
the
hebrew
text
we
were
like
unto
them
that
yet
it
was
a
dream
which
they
were
certain
was
a
truth
while
they
seemed
to
doubt
it
so
too
was
it
in
some
sense
with
the
apostles
after
our
lord
s
resurrection
such
vague
thoughts
haunting
or
evanescent
are
in
no
sense
akin
to
that
struggle
between
faith
and
unbelief
which
made
the
poor
father
cry
out
i
believe
help
thou
mine
unbelief
nay
even
what
in
some
minds
seems
like
an
undercurrent
of
scepticism
or
a
faith
founded
on
a
perilous
substratum
of
doubt
need
not
be
more
than
a
temptation
though
robbing
certitude
of
its
normal
peacefulness
in
such
a
case
faith
may
still
express
the
steady
conviction
of
the
intellect
it
may
still
be
the
grave
deep
calm
prudent
assurance
of
mature
experience
though
it
is
not
the
ready
and
impetuous
assent
of
the
young
the
generous
or
the
unreflecting
there
is
another
characteristic
of
certitude
in
contrast
with
assent
which
it
is
important
to
insist
upon
and
that
is
its
persistence
assents
may
and
do
change
certitudes
endure
this
is
why
religion
demands
more
than
an
assent
to
its
truth
it
requires
a
certitude
or
at
least
an
assent
which
is
convertible
into
certitude
on
demand
without
certitude
in
religious
faith
there
may
be
much
decency
of
profession
and
of
observance
but
there
can
be
no
habit
of
prayer
no
directness
of
devotion
no
intercourse
with
the
unseen
no
generosity
of
certitude
then
is
essential
to
the
christian
and
if
he
is
to
persevere
to
the
end
his
certitude
must
include
in
it
a
principle
of
persistence
this
it
has
as
i
shall
explain
in
the
next
section
indefectibility
of
certitude
it
is
the
characteristic
of
certitude
that
its
object
is
a
truth
a
truth
as
such
a
proposition
as
true
there
are
right
and
wrong
convictions
and
certitude
is
a
right
conviction
if
it
is
not
right
with
a
consciousness
of
being
right
it
is
not
certitude
now
truth
can
not
change
what
is
once
truth
is
always
truth
and
the
human
mind
is
made
for
truth
and
so
rests
in
truth
as
it
can
not
rest
in
falsehood
when
then
it
once
becomes
possessed
of
a
truth
what
is
to
dispossess
it
but
this
is
to
be
certain
therefore
once
certitude
always
certitude
if
certitude
in
any
matter
be
the
termination
of
all
doubt
or
fear
about
its
truth
and
an
unconditional
conscious
adherence
to
it
it
carries
with
it
an
inward
assurance
strong
though
implicit
that
it
shall
never
fail
indefectibility
almost
enters
into
its
very
idea
enters
into
it
at
least
so
far
as
this
that
its
failure
if
of
frequent
occurrence
would
prove
that
certitude
was
after
all
and
in
fact
an
impossible
act
and
that
what
looked
like
it
was
a
mere
extravagance
of
the
intellect
truth
would
still
be
truth
but
the
knowledge
of
it
would
be
beyond
us
and
unattainable
it
is
of
great
importance
then
to
show
that
as
a
general
rule
certitude
does
not
fail
that
failures
of
what
was
taken
for
certitude
are
the
exception
that
the
intellect
which
is
made
for
truth
can
attain
truth
and
having
attained
it
can
keep
it
can
recognize
it
and
preserve
the
recognition
this
is
on
the
whole
reasonable
yet
are
the
stipulations
thus
obviously
necessary
for
an
act
or
state
of
certitude
ever
fulfilled
we
know
what
conjecture
is
and
what
opinion
and
what
assent
is
can
we
point
out
any
specific
state
or
habit
of
thought
of
which
the
distinguishing
mark
is
unchangeableness
on
the
contrary
any
conviction
false
as
well
as
true
may
last
and
any
conviction
true
as
well
as
false
may
be
lost
a
conviction
in
favour
of
a
proposition
may
be
exchanged
for
a
conviction
of
its
contradictory
and
each
of
them
may
be
attended
while
they
last
by
that
sense
of
security
and
repose
which
a
true
object
alone
can
legitimately
impart
no
line
can
be
drawn
between
such
real
certitudes
as
have
truth
for
their
object
and
apparent
certitudes
no
distinct
test
can
be
named
sufficient
to
discriminate
between
what
may
be
called
the
false
prophet
and
the
true
what
looks
like
certitude
always
is
exposed
to
the
chance
of
turning
out
to
be
a
mistake
if
our
intimate
deliberate
conviction
may
be
counterfeit
in
the
case
of
one
proposition
why
not
in
the
case
of
another
if
in
the
case
of
one
man
why
not
in
the
case
of
a
hundred
is
certitude
then
ever
possible
without
the
attendant
gift
of
infallibility
can
we
know
what
is
right
in
one
case
unless
we
are
secured
against
error
in
any
further
if
one
man
is
infallible
why
is
he
different
from
his
brethren
unless
indeed
he
is
distinctly
marked
out
for
the
prerogative
must
not
all
men
be
infallible
by
consequence
if
any
man
is
to
be
considered
as
certain
the
difficulty
thus
stated
argumentatively
has
only
too
accurate
a
response
in
what
actually
goes
on
in
the
world
it
is
a
fact
of
daily
occurrence
that
men
change
their
certitudes
that
is
what
they
consider
to
be
such
and
are
as
confident
and
in
their
new
opinions
as
they
were
once
in
their
old
they
take
up
forms
of
religion
only
to
leave
them
for
their
contradictories
they
risk
their
fortunes
and
their
lives
on
impossible
adventures
they
commit
themselves
by
word
and
deed
in
reputation
and
position
to
schemes
which
in
the
event
they
bitterly
repent
of
and
renounce
they
set
out
in
youth
with
intemperate
confidence
in
prospects
which
fail
them
and
in
friends
who
betray
them
ere
they
come
to
middle
age
and
they
end
their
days
in
cynical
disbelief
of
truth
and
virtue
any
where
often
the
more
absurd
are
their
means
and
their
ends
so
much
the
longer
do
they
cling
to
them
and
then
again
so
much
the
more
passionate
is
their
eventual
disgust
and
contempt
of
them
how
then
can
certitude
be
theirs
how
is
certitude
possible
at
all
considering
it
is
so
often
misplaced
so
often
fickle
and
inconsistent
so
deficient
in
available
criteria
and
as
to
the
feeling
of
finality
and
security
ought
it
ever
to
be
indulged
is
it
not
a
mere
weakness
or
extravagance
a
deceit
to
be
eschewed
by
every
clear
and
prudent
mind
with
the
countless
instances
on
all
sides
of
us
of
human
fallibility
with
the
constant
exhibitions
of
antagonist
certitudes
who
can
so
sin
against
modesty
and
sobriety
of
mind
as
not
to
be
content
with
probability
as
the
true
guide
of
life
renouncing
ambitious
thoughts
which
are
sure
either
to
delude
him
or
to
disappoint
this
is
what
may
be
objected
now
let
us
see
what
can
be
said
in
answer
particularly
as
regards
religious
certitude
first
as
to
fallibility
and
infallibility
it
is
very
common
doubtless
especially
in
religious
controversy
to
confuse
infallibility
with
certitude
and
to
argue
that
since
we
have
not
the
one
we
have
not
the
other
for
that
no
one
can
claim
to
be
certain
on
any
point
who
is
not
infallible
about
all
but
the
two
words
stand
for
things
quite
distinct
from
each
other
for
example
i
remember
for
certain
what
i
did
yesterday
but
still
my
memory
is
not
infallible
i
am
quite
clear
that
two
and
two
makes
four
but
i
often
make
mistakes
in
long
addition
sums
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
john
or
richard
is
my
true
friend
but
i
have
before
now
trusted
those
who
failed
me
and
i
may
do
so
again
before
i
die
a
certitude
is
directed
to
this
or
that
particular
proposition
it
is
not
a
faculty
or
gift
but
a
disposition
of
mind
relatively
to
a
definite
case
which
is
before
me
infallibility
on
the
contrary
is
just
that
which
certitude
is
not
it
is
a
faculty
or
gift
and
relates
not
to
some
one
truth
in
particular
but
to
all
possible
propositions
in
a
given
we
ought
in
strict
propriety
to
speak
not
of
infallible
acts
but
of
acts
of
infallibility
a
belief
or
opinion
as
little
admits
of
being
called
infallible
as
a
deed
can
correctly
be
called
immortal
a
deed
is
done
and
over
it
may
be
great
momentous
effective
anything
but
immortal
it
is
its
fame
it
is
the
work
which
it
brings
to
pass
which
is
immortal
not
the
deed
itself
and
as
a
deed
is
good
or
bad
but
never
immortal
so
a
belief
opinion
or
certitude
is
true
or
false
but
never
infallible
we
can
not
speak
of
things
which
exist
or
things
which
once
were
as
if
they
were
something
it
is
persons
and
rules
that
are
infallible
not
what
is
brought
out
into
act
or
committed
to
paper
a
man
is
infallible
whose
words
are
always
true
a
rule
is
infallible
if
it
is
unerring
in
all
its
possible
applications
an
infallible
authority
is
certain
in
every
particular
case
that
may
arise
but
a
man
who
is
certain
in
some
one
definite
case
is
not
on
that
account
infallible
i
am
quite
certain
that
victoria
is
our
sovereign
and
not
her
father
the
late
duke
of
kent
without
laying
any
claim
to
the
gift
of
infallibility
as
i
may
do
a
virtuous
action
without
being
impeccable
i
may
be
certain
that
the
church
is
infallible
while
i
am
myself
a
fallible
mortal
otherwise
i
can
not
be
certain
that
the
supreme
being
is
infallible
until
i
am
infallible
myself
it
is
a
strange
objection
then
which
is
sometimes
urged
against
catholics
that
they
can
not
prove
and
assent
to
the
church
s
infallibility
unless
they
first
believe
in
their
own
certitude
as
i
have
said
is
directed
to
one
or
other
definite
concrete
proposition
i
am
certain
of
proposition
one
two
three
four
or
five
one
by
one
each
by
itself
i
may
be
certain
of
one
of
them
without
being
certain
of
the
rest
that
i
am
certain
of
the
first
makes
it
neither
likely
nor
unlikely
that
i
am
certain
of
the
second
but
were
i
infallible
then
i
should
be
certain
not
only
of
one
of
them
but
of
all
and
of
many
more
besides
which
have
never
come
before
me
as
yet
therefore
we
may
be
certain
of
the
infallibility
of
the
church
while
we
admit
that
in
many
things
we
are
not
and
can
not
be
certain
at
all
it
is
wonderful
that
a
man
like
chillingworth
sees
this
as
little
as
the
run
of
objectors
to
the
catholic
religion
for
in
his
celebrated
religion
of
protestants
he
writes
as
follows
you
tell
me
they
can
not
be
saved
unless
they
believe
in
your
proposals
with
an
infallible
faith
to
which
end
they
must
believe
also
your
propounder
the
church
to
be
simply
infallible
now
how
is
it
possible
for
them
to
give
a
rational
assent
to
the
church
s
infallibility
they
have
some
infallible
means
to
know
that
she
is
neither
can
they
infallibly
know
the
infallibility
of
this
means
but
by
some
other
and
so
on
for
ever
unless
they
can
dig
so
deep
as
to
come
at
length
to
the
rock
that
is
to
settle
all
upon
something
evident
of
itself
which
is
not
so
much
as
pretended
now
what
is
an
infallible
means
it
is
a
means
of
coming
at
a
fact
without
the
chance
of
mistake
it
is
a
proof
which
is
sufficient
for
certitude
in
the
particular
case
or
a
proof
that
is
certain
when
then
chillingworth
says
that
there
can
be
no
rational
assent
to
the
church
s
infallibility
without
some
infallible
means
of
knowing
that
she
is
infallible
he
means
nothing
else
than
some
means
which
is
certain
he
says
that
for
a
rational
assent
to
infallibility
there
must
be
an
absolutely
valid
or
certain
proof
this
is
intelligible
but
observe
how
his
argument
will
run
if
worded
according
to
this
interpretation
the
doctrine
of
the
church
s
infallibility
requires
a
proof
that
is
certain
and
that
certain
proof
requires
another
previous
certain
proof
and
that
again
another
and
so
on
unless
indeed
we
dig
so
deep
as
to
settle
all
upon
something
evident
of
what
is
this
but
to
say
that
nothing
in
this
world
is
certain
but
what
is
that
nothing
can
be
absolutely
proved
can
he
really
mean
this
what
then
becomes
of
physical
truth
of
the
discoveries
in
optics
chemistry
and
electricity
or
of
the
science
of
motion
intuition
by
itself
will
carry
us
but
a
little
way
into
that
circle
of
knowledge
which
is
the
boast
of
the
present
age
i
can
believe
then
in
the
infallible
church
without
my
own
personal
infallibility
certitude
is
at
most
nothing
more
than
infallibility
hac
and
promises
nothing
as
to
the
truth
of
any
proposition
beside
its
own
that
i
am
certain
of
this
proposition
is
no
ground
for
thinking
that
i
shall
have
a
right
to
be
certain
of
that
proposition
and
that
i
am
wrong
in
my
convictions
about
s
proposition
does
not
hinder
my
having
a
true
conviction
a
genuine
certitude
about
s
proposition
if
indeed
i
claimed
to
be
infallible
one
failure
would
shiver
my
claim
to
pieces
but
i
may
claim
to
be
certain
of
the
truth
to
which
i
have
already
attained
though
i
should
arrive
at
no
new
truths
in
addition
as
long
as
i
live
let
us
put
aside
the
word
infallibility
let
us
understand
by
certitude
as
i
have
explained
it
nothing
more
than
a
relation
of
the
mind
towards
given
propositions
it
may
be
urged
it
involves
a
sense
of
security
and
of
repose
at
least
as
regards
these
in
particular
now
how
can
this
security
be
mine
which
certitude
is
not
i
know
as
i
know
too
well
that
before
now
i
have
thought
myself
certain
when
i
was
certain
after
all
of
an
untruth
is
not
the
very
possibility
of
certitude
lost
to
me
for
ever
by
that
one
mistake
what
happened
once
may
happen
again
all
my
certitudes
before
and
after
are
henceforth
destroyed
by
the
introduction
of
a
reasonable
doubt
underlying
them
all
they
cease
to
be
certitudes
come
short
of
unconditional
assents
by
the
measure
of
that
counterfeit
assurance
they
are
nothing
more
to
me
than
opinions
or
anticipations
judgments
on
the
verisimilitude
of
intellectual
views
not
the
possession
and
enjoyment
of
truths
and
who
has
not
thus
been
balked
by
false
certitudes
a
hundred
times
in
the
course
of
his
experience
and
how
can
certitude
have
a
legitimate
place
in
our
mental
constitution
when
it
thus
manifestly
ministers
to
error
and
to
scepticism
this
is
what
may
be
objected
and
it
is
not
as
i
think
difficult
to
answer
certainly
the
experience
of
mistakes
in
the
assents
which
we
have
made
are
to
the
prejudice
of
subsequent
ones
there
is
an
antecedent
difficulty
in
our
allowing
ourselves
to
be
certain
of
something
if
yesterday
we
had
to
give
up
our
belief
of
something
else
of
which
we
had
up
to
that
time
professed
ourselves
to
be
certain
this
is
true
but
antecedent
objections
to
an
act
are
not
sufficient
of
themselves
to
prohibit
its
exercise
they
may
demand
of
us
an
increased
circumspection
before
committing
ourselves
to
it
but
may
be
met
with
reasons
more
than
sufficient
to
overcome
them
it
must
be
recollected
that
certitude
is
a
deliberate
assent
given
expressly
after
reasoning
if
then
my
certitude
is
unfounded
it
is
the
reasoning
that
is
in
fault
not
my
assent
to
it
it
is
the
law
of
my
mind
to
seal
up
the
conclusions
to
which
ratiocination
has
brought
me
by
that
formal
assent
which
i
have
called
a
certitude
i
could
indeed
have
withheld
my
assent
but
i
should
have
acted
against
my
nature
had
i
done
so
when
there
was
what
i
considered
a
proof
and
i
did
only
what
was
fitting
what
was
incumbent
on
me
upon
those
existing
conditions
in
giving
it
this
is
the
process
by
which
knowledge
accumulates
and
is
stored
up
both
in
the
individual
and
in
the
world
it
has
sometimes
been
remarked
when
men
have
boasted
of
the
knowledge
of
modern
times
that
no
wonder
we
see
more
than
the
ancients
because
we
are
mounted
upon
their
shoulders
the
conclusions
of
one
generation
are
the
truths
of
the
next
we
are
able
it
is
our
duty
deliberately
to
take
things
for
granted
which
our
forefathers
had
a
duty
to
doubt
about
and
unless
we
summarily
put
down
disputation
on
points
which
have
been
already
proved
and
ruled
we
shall
waste
our
time
and
make
no
advances
circumstances
indeed
may
arise
when
a
question
may
legitimately
be
revived
which
has
already
been
definitely
determined
but
a
of
such
a
question
need
not
abruptly
unsettle
the
existing
certitude
of
those
who
engage
in
it
or
throw
them
into
a
scepticism
about
things
in
general
even
though
eventually
they
find
they
have
been
wrong
in
a
particular
matter
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
prohibit
the
controversy
which
has
lately
been
held
concerning
the
obligations
of
newton
to
pascal
and
supposing
it
had
issued
in
their
being
established
the
partisans
of
newton
would
not
have
thought
it
necessary
to
renounce
their
certitude
of
the
law
of
gravitation
itself
on
the
ground
that
they
had
been
mistaken
in
their
certitude
that
newton
discovered
it
if
we
are
never
to
be
certain
after
having
been
once
certain
wrongly
then
we
ought
never
to
attempt
a
proof
because
we
have
once
made
a
bad
one
errors
in
reasoning
are
lessons
and
warnings
not
to
give
up
reasoning
but
to
reason
with
greater
caution
it
is
absurd
to
break
up
the
whole
structure
of
our
knowledge
which
is
the
glory
of
the
human
intellect
because
the
intellect
is
not
infallible
in
its
conclusions
if
in
any
particular
case
we
have
been
mistaken
in
our
inferences
and
the
certitudes
which
followed
upon
them
we
are
bound
of
course
to
take
the
fact
of
this
mistake
into
account
in
making
up
our
minds
on
any
new
question
before
we
proceed
to
decide
upon
it
but
if
while
weighing
the
arguments
on
one
side
and
the
other
and
drawing
our
conclusion
that
old
mistake
has
already
been
allowed
for
or
has
been
to
use
a
familiar
mode
of
speaking
discounted
then
it
has
no
outstanding
claim
against
our
acceptance
of
that
conclusion
after
it
has
actually
been
drawn
whatever
be
the
legitimate
weight
of
the
fact
of
that
mistake
in
our
inquiry
justice
has
been
done
to
it
before
we
have
allowed
ourselves
to
be
certain
again
suppose
i
am
walking
out
in
the
moonlight
and
see
dimly
the
outlines
of
some
figure
among
the
trees
is
a
man
i
draw
nearer
is
still
a
man
nearer
still
and
all
hesitation
is
at
an
end
am
certain
it
is
a
man
but
he
neither
moves
nor
speaks
when
i
address
him
and
then
i
ask
myself
what
can
be
his
purpose
in
hiding
among
the
trees
at
such
an
hour
i
come
quite
close
to
him
and
put
out
my
arm
then
i
find
for
certain
that
what
i
took
for
a
man
is
but
a
singular
shadow
formed
by
the
falling
of
the
moonlight
on
the
interstices
of
some
branches
or
their
foliage
am
i
not
to
indulge
my
second
certitude
because
i
was
wrong
in
my
first
does
not
any
objection
which
lies
against
my
second
from
the
failure
of
my
first
fade
away
before
the
evidence
on
which
my
second
is
founded
or
again
i
depose
on
my
oath
in
a
court
of
justice
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
that
i
was
robbed
by
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
then
when
the
real
offender
is
brought
before
me
i
am
obliged
to
my
great
confusion
to
retract
because
i
have
been
mistaken
in
my
certitude
may
i
not
at
least
be
certain
that
i
have
been
mistaken
and
further
in
spite
of
the
shock
which
that
mistake
gives
me
is
it
impossible
that
the
sight
of
the
real
culprit
may
give
me
so
luminous
a
conviction
that
at
length
i
have
got
the
right
man
that
were
it
decent
towards
the
court
or
consistent
with
i
may
find
myself
prepared
to
swear
to
the
identity
of
the
second
as
i
have
already
solemnly
committed
myself
to
the
identity
of
the
first
it
is
manifest
that
the
two
certitudes
stand
each
on
its
own
basis
and
the
antecedent
objection
to
the
admission
of
a
truth
which
was
brought
home
to
me
second
drawn
from
a
hallucination
which
came
first
is
a
mere
abstract
argument
impotent
when
directed
against
good
evidence
lying
in
the
concrete
if
in
the
criminal
case
which
i
have
been
supposing
the
second
certitude
felt
by
a
witness
was
a
legitimate
state
of
mind
so
was
the
first
an
act
viewed
in
itself
is
not
wrong
because
it
is
done
wrongly
false
certitudes
are
faults
because
they
are
false
not
because
they
are
certitudes
they
are
or
may
be
the
attempts
and
the
failures
of
an
intellect
insufficiently
trained
or
off
its
guard
assent
is
an
act
of
the
mind
congenial
to
its
nature
and
it
as
other
acts
may
be
made
both
when
it
ought
to
be
made
and
when
it
ought
not
it
is
a
free
act
a
personal
act
for
which
the
doer
is
responsible
and
the
actual
mistakes
in
making
it
be
they
ever
so
numerous
or
serious
have
no
force
whatever
to
prohibit
the
act
itself
we
are
accustomed
in
such
cases
to
appeal
to
the
maxim
usum
non
tollit
abusus
and
it
is
plain
that
if
what
may
be
called
functional
disarrangements
of
the
intellect
are
to
be
considered
fatal
to
the
recognition
of
the
functions
themselves
then
the
mind
has
no
laws
whatever
and
no
normal
constitution
i
just
now
spoke
of
the
growth
of
knowledge
there
is
also
a
growth
in
the
use
of
those
faculties
by
which
knowledge
is
acquired
the
intellect
admits
of
an
education
man
is
a
being
of
progress
he
has
to
learn
how
to
fulfil
his
end
and
to
be
what
facts
show
that
he
is
intended
to
be
his
mind
is
in
the
first
instance
in
disorder
and
runs
wild
his
faculties
have
their
rudimental
and
inchoate
state
and
are
gradually
carried
on
by
practice
and
experience
to
their
perfection
no
instances
then
whatever
of
mistaken
certitude
are
sufficient
to
constitute
a
proof
that
certitude
itself
is
a
perversion
or
extravagance
of
his
nature
we
do
not
dispense
with
clocks
because
from
time
to
time
they
go
wrong
and
tell
untruly
a
clock
organically
considered
may
be
perfect
yet
it
may
require
regulating
till
that
needful
work
is
done
the
may
mark
the
when
the
is
at
the
and
the
hour
hand
is
just
at
noon
and
the
strikes
the
and
the
strikes
four
while
the
precisely
tells
two
o
clock
the
sense
of
certitude
may
be
called
the
bell
of
the
intellect
and
that
it
strikes
when
it
should
not
is
a
proof
that
the
clock
is
out
of
order
no
proof
that
the
bell
will
be
untrustworthy
and
useless
when
it
comes
to
us
adjusted
and
regulated
from
the
hands
of
the
our
conscience
too
may
be
said
to
strike
the
hours
and
will
strike
them
wrongly
unless
it
be
duly
regulated
for
the
performance
of
its
proper
function
it
is
the
loud
announcement
of
the
principle
of
right
in
the
details
of
conduct
as
the
sense
of
certitude
is
the
clear
witness
to
what
is
true
both
certitude
and
conscience
have
a
place
in
the
normal
condition
of
the
mind
as
a
human
being
i
am
unable
if
i
were
to
try
to
live
without
some
kind
of
conscience
and
i
am
as
little
able
to
live
without
those
landmarks
of
thought
which
certitude
secures
for
me
still
as
the
hammer
of
a
clock
may
tell
untruly
so
may
my
conscience
and
my
sense
of
certitude
be
attached
to
mental
acts
whether
of
consent
or
of
assent
which
have
no
claim
to
be
thus
sanctioned
both
the
moral
and
the
intellectual
sanction
are
liable
to
be
biassed
by
personal
inclinations
and
motives
both
require
and
admit
of
discipline
and
as
it
is
no
disproof
of
the
authority
of
conscience
that
false
consciences
abound
neither
does
it
destroy
the
importance
and
the
uses
of
certitude
because
even
educated
minds
who
are
earnest
in
their
inquiries
after
the
truth
in
many
cases
remain
under
the
power
of
prejudice
or
delusion
to
this
deficiency
in
mental
training
a
wider
error
is
to
be
attributed
mistaking
for
conviction
and
certitude
states
and
frames
of
mind
which
make
no
pretence
to
the
fundamental
condition
on
which
conviction
rests
as
distinct
from
assent
the
multitude
of
men
confuse
together
the
probable
the
possible
and
the
certain
and
apply
these
terms
to
doctrines
and
statements
almost
at
random
they
have
no
clear
view
what
it
is
they
know
what
they
presume
what
they
suppose
and
what
they
only
assert
they
make
little
distinction
between
credence
opinion
and
profession
at
various
times
they
give
them
all
perhaps
the
name
of
certitude
and
accordingly
when
they
change
their
minds
they
fancy
they
have
given
up
points
of
which
they
had
a
true
conviction
or
at
least
bystanders
thus
speak
of
them
and
the
very
idea
of
certitude
falls
into
disrepute
in
this
day
the
of
thought
and
belief
has
so
increased
upon
us
that
a
far
higher
mental
formation
is
required
than
was
necessary
in
times
past
and
higher
than
we
have
actually
reached
the
whole
world
is
brought
to
our
doors
every
morning
and
our
judgment
is
required
upon
social
concerns
books
persons
parties
creeds
national
acts
political
principles
and
measures
we
have
to
form
our
opinion
make
our
profession
take
our
side
on
a
hundred
matters
on
which
we
have
but
little
right
to
speak
at
all
but
we
do
speak
and
must
speak
upon
them
though
neither
we
nor
those
who
hear
us
are
well
able
to
determine
what
is
the
real
position
of
our
intellect
relatively
to
those
many
questions
one
by
one
on
which
we
commit
ourselves
and
then
since
many
of
these
questions
change
their
complexion
with
the
passing
hour
and
many
require
elaborate
consideration
and
many
are
simply
beyond
us
it
is
not
wonderful
if
at
the
end
of
a
few
years
we
have
to
revise
or
to
repudiate
our
conclusions
and
then
we
shall
be
unfairly
said
to
have
changed
our
certitudes
and
shall
confirm
the
doctrine
that
except
in
abstract
truth
no
judgment
rises
higher
than
probability
such
are
the
mistakes
about
certitude
among
educated
men
and
after
referring
to
them
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
to
dwell
upon
the
absurdities
and
excesses
of
the
rude
intellect
as
seen
in
the
world
at
large
as
if
any
one
could
dream
of
treating
as
deliberate
assents
as
assents
upon
assents
as
convictions
or
certitudes
the
prejudices
credulities
infatuations
superstitions
fanaticisms
the
whims
and
fancies
the
sudden
irrevocable
plunges
into
the
unknown
the
obstinate
determinations
offspring
as
they
are
of
ignorance
wilfulness
cupidity
and
pride
go
so
far
to
make
up
the
history
of
mankind
yet
these
are
often
set
down
as
instances
of
certitude
and
of
its
failure
i
have
spoken
of
certitude
as
being
assigned
a
definite
and
fixed
place
among
our
mental
acts
follows
upon
examination
and
proof
as
the
bell
sounds
the
hour
when
the
hands
reach
it
that
no
act
or
state
of
the
intellect
is
certitude
however
it
may
resemble
it
which
does
not
observe
this
appointed
law
this
proviso
greatly
diminishes
the
catalogue
of
genuine
certitudes
another
restriction
is
this
occasions
or
of
certitude
are
under
law
also
putting
aside
the
daily
exercise
of
the
senses
the
principal
subjects
in
secular
knowledge
about
which
we
can
be
certain
are
the
truths
or
facts
which
are
its
basis
as
to
this
world
we
are
certain
of
the
elements
of
knowledge
whether
general
scientific
historical
or
such
as
bear
on
our
daily
needs
and
habits
and
relate
to
ourselves
our
homes
and
families
our
friends
neighbourhood
country
and
civil
state
beyond
these
elementary
points
of
knowledge
lies
a
vast
of
opinion
credence
and
belief
viz
the
field
of
public
affairs
of
social
and
professional
life
of
business
of
duty
of
literature
of
taste
nay
of
the
experimental
sciences
on
subjects
such
as
these
the
reasonings
and
conclusions
of
mankind
vary
mundum

prudent
men
in
consequence
seldom
speak
confidently
unless
they
are
warranted
to
do
so
by
genius
great
experience
or
some
special
qualification
they
determine
their
judgments
by
what
is
probable
what
is
safe
what
promises
best
what
has
verisimilitude
what
impresses
and
sways
them
they
neither
can
possess
nor
need
certitude
nor
do
they
look
out
for
it
hence
it
is
province
of
certitude
being
so
contracted
and
that
of
opinion
so
is
common
to
call
probability
the
guide
of
life
this
saying
when
properly
explained
is
true
however
we
must
not
suffer
ourselves
to
carry
a
true
maxim
to
an
extreme
it
is
far
from
true
if
we
so
hold
it
as
to
forget
that
without
first
principles
there
can
be
no
conclusions
at
all
and
that
thus
probability
does
in
some
sense
presuppose
and
require
the
existence
of
truths
which
are
certain
especially
is
the
maxim
untrue
in
respect
to
the
other
great
department
of
knowledge
if
taken
to
support
the
doctrine
that
the
first
principles
and
elements
of
religion
which
are
universally
received
are
mere
matter
of
opinion
though
in
this
day
it
is
too
often
taken
for
granted
that
religion
is
one
of
those
subjects
on
which
truth
can
not
be
discovered
and
on
which
one
conclusion
is
pretty
much
on
a
level
with
another
but
on
the
contrary
the
initial
truths
of
divine
knowledge
ought
to
be
viewed
as
parallel
to
the
initial
truths
of
secular
as
the
latter
are
certain
so
too
are
the
former
i
can
not
indeed
deny
that
a
decent
reverence
for
the
supreme
being
an
acquiescence
in
the
claims
of
revelation
a
general
profession
of
christian
doctrine
and
some
sort
of
attendance
on
sacred
ordinances
is
in
fact
all
the
religion
that
is
usual
with
even
the
better
sort
of
men
and
that
for
all
this
a
sufficient
basis
may
certainly
be
found
in
probabilities
but
if
religion
is
to
be
devotion
and
not
a
mere
matter
of
sentiment
if
it
is
to
be
made
the
ruling
principle
of
our
lives
if
our
actions
one
by
one
and
our
daily
conduct
are
to
be
consistently
directed
towards
an
invisible
being
we
need
something
higher
than
a
mere
balance
of
arguments
to
fix
and
to
control
our
minds
sacrifice
of
wealth
name
or
position
faith
and
hope
communion
with
the
spiritual
world
presuppose
a
real
hold
and
habitual
intuition
of
the
objects
of
revelation
which
is
certitude
under
another
name
to
this
issue
indeed
we
may
bring
the
main
difference
viewed
philosophically
between
nominal
christianity
on
the
one
hand
and
vital
christianity
on
the
other
rational
sensible
men
as
they
consider
themselves
men
who
do
not
comprehend
the
very
notion
of
loving
god
above
all
things
are
content
with
such
a
measure
of
probability
for
the
truths
of
religion
as
serves
them
in
their
secular
transactions
but
those
who
are
deliberately
staking
their
all
upon
the
hopes
of
the
next
world
think
it
reasonable
and
find
it
necessary
before
starting
on
their
new
course
to
have
some
points
clear
and
immutable
to
start
from
otherwise
they
will
not
start
at
all
they
ask
as
a
preliminary
condition
to
have
the
ground
sure
under
their
feet
they
look
for
more
than
human
reasonings
and
inferences
for
nothing
less
than
the
strong
consolation
as
the
apostle
speaks
of
those
immutable
things
in
which
it
is
impossible
for
god
to
lie
his
counsel
and
his
oath
christian
earnestness
may
be
ruled
by
the
world
to
be
a
perverseness
or
a
delusion
but
as
long
as
it
exists
it
will
presuppose
certitude
as
the
very
life
which
is
to
animate
it
this
is
the
true
parallel
between
human
and
divine
knowledge
each
of
them
opens
into
a
large
field
of
mere
opinion
but
in
both
the
one
and
the
other
the
primary
principles
the
general
fundamental
cardinal
truths
are
immutable
in
human
matters
we
are
guided
by
probabilities
but
i
repeat
they
are
probabilities
founded
on
certainties
it
is
on
no
probability
that
we
are
constantly
receiving
the
informations
and
dictates
of
sense
and
memory
of
our
intellectual
instincts
of
the
moral
sense
and
of
the
logical
faculty
it
is
on
no
probability
that
we
receive
the
generalizations
of
science
and
the
great
outlines
of
history
these
are
certain
truths
and
from
them
each
of
us
forms
his
own
judgments
and
directs
his
own
course
according
to
the
probabilities
which
they
suggest
to
him
as
the
navigator
applies
his
observations
and
his
charts
for
the
determination
of
his
course
such
is
the
main
view
to
be
taken
of
the
separate
provinces
of
probability
and
certainty
in
matters
of
this
world
and
so
as
regards
the
world
invisible
and
future
we
have
a
direct
and
conscious
knowledge
of
our
maker
his
attributes
his
providences
acts
works
and
will
and
beyond
this
knowledge
lies
the
large
domain
of
theology
metaphysics
and
ethics
on
which
it
is
not
allowed
to
us
to
advance
beyond
probabilities
or
to
attain
to
more
than
an
opinion
such
on
the
whole
is
the
analogy
between
our
knowledge
of
matters
of
this
world
and
matters
of
the
world
unseen
certitude
in
primary
truths
manifold
variations
of
opinion
in
their
application
and
disposition
i
have
said
that
certitude
whether
in
human
or
divine
knowledge
is
attainable
as
regards
general
and
cardinal
truths
and
that
in
neither
department
of
knowledge
on
the
whole
is
certitude
discredited
lost
or
reversed
for
in
matter
of
fact
whether
in
human
or
divine
those
primary
truths
have
ever
kept
their
place
from
the
time
when
they
first
took
possession
of
it
however
there
is
one
obvious
objection
which
may
be
made
to
this
representation
and
i
proceed
to
take
notice
of
it
it
may
be
urged
then
that
time
was
when
the
primary
truths
of
science
were
unknown
and
when
in
consequence
various
theories
were
held
contrary
to
each
other
the
first
element
of
all
things
was
said
to
be
water
to
be
air
to
be
fire
the
framework
of
the
universe
was
eternal
or
it
was
the
combination
of
innumerable
atoms
the
planets
were
fixed
in
solid
crystal
revolving
spheres
or
they
moved
round
the
earth
in
epicycles
mounted
upon
circular
orbits
or
they
were
carried
whirling
round
about
the
sun
while
the
sun
was
whirling
round
the
earth
about
such
doctrines
there
was
no
certitude
no
more
than
there
is
now
certitude
about
the
origin
of
languages
the
age
of
man
or
the
evolution
of
species
considered
as
philosophical
questions
now
theology
is
at
present
in
the
very
same
state
in
which
natural
science
was
five
hundred
years
ago
and
this
is
the
proof
of
it
instead
of
there
being
one
received
theological
science
in
the
world
there
are
a
multitude
of
hypotheses
we
have
a
professed
science
of
atheism
another
of
deism
a
pantheistic
ever
so
many
christian
theologies
to
say
nothing
of
judaism
islamism
and
the
oriental
religions
each
of
these
creeds
has
its
own
upholders
and
these
upholders
all
certain
that
it
is
the
very
and
the
only
truth
and
these
same
upholders
it
may
happen
presently
giving
it
up
and
then
taking
up
some
other
creed
and
being
certain
again
as
they
profess
that
it
and
it
only
is
the
truth
these
various
truths
being
incompatible
with
each
other
are
not
jews
certain
about
their
interpretation
of
their
law
yet
they
become
christians
are
not
catholics
certain
about
the
new
law
yet
they
become
protestants
at
present
then
and
as
yet
there
is
no
clear
certainty
anywhere
about
religious
truth
at
all
it
has
still
to
be
discovered
and
therefore
for
catholics
to
claim
the
right
to
lay
down
the
first
principles
of
theological
science
in
their
own
way
is
to
assume
the
very
matter
in
dispute
first
let
their
doctrines
be
universally
received
and
then
they
will
have
a
right
to
place
them
on
a
level
with
the
certainty
which
belongs
to
the
laws
of
motion
or
of
refraction
this
is
the
objection
which
i
propose
to
consider
now
first
as
to
the
want
of
universal
reception
which
is
urged
against
the
catholic
dogmas
this
part
of
the
objection
will
not
require
many
words
surely
a
truth
or
a
fact
may
be
certain
though
it
is
not
generally
received
are
each
of
us
ever
gaining
through
our
senses
various
certainties
which
no
one
shares
with
us
again
the
certainties
of
the
sciences
are
in
the
possession
of
a
few
countries
only
and
for
the
most
part
only
of
the
educated
classes
in
those
countries
yet
the
philosophers
of
europe
and
america
would
feel
certain
that
the
earth
rolled
round
the
sun
in
spite
of
the
indian
belief
of
its
being
supported
by
an
elephant
with
a
tortoise
under
it
the
catholic
church
then
though
not
universally
acknowledged
may
without
inconsistency
claim
to
teach
the
primary
truths
of
religion
just
as
modern
science
though
but
partially
received
claims
to
teach
the
great
principles
and
laws
which
are
the
foundation
of
secular
knowledge
and
that
with
a
significance
to
which
no
other
religious
system
can
pretend
because
it
is
its
very
profession
to
speak
to
all
mankind
and
its
very
badge
to
be
ever
making
converts
all
over
the
earth
whereas
other
religions
are
more
or
less
variable
in
their
teaching
tolerant
of
each
other
and
local
and
professedly
local
in
their
and
character
this
however
is
not
the
main
point
of
the
objection
the
real
difficulty
lies
not
in
the
variety
of
religions
but
in
the
contradiction
conflict
and
change
of
religious
certitudes
truth
need
not
be
universal
but
it
must
of
necessity
be
certain
and
certainty
in
order
to
be
certainty
must
endure
yet
how
is
this
reasonable
expectation
fulfilled
in
the
case
of
religion
on
the
contrary
those
who
have
been
the
most
certain
in
their
beliefs
are
sometimes
found
to
lose
them
catholics
as
well
as
others
and
then
to
take
up
new
beliefs
perhaps
contrary
ones
of
which
they
become
as
certain
as
if
they
had
never
been
certain
of
the
old
in
answering
this
representation
i
begin
with
recurring
to
the
remark
which
i
have
already
made
that
assent
and
certitude
have
reference
to
propositions
one
by
one
we
may
of
course
assent
to
a
number
of
propositions
all
together
that
is
we
may
make
a
number
of
assents
all
at
once
but
in
doing
so
we
run
the
risk
of
putting
upon
one
level
and
treating
as
if
of
the
same
value
acts
of
the
mind
which
are
very
different
from
each
other
in
character
and
circumstance
an
assent
indeed
is
ever
an
assent
but
given
assents
may
be
strong
or
weak
deliberate
or
impulsive
lasting
or
ephemeral
now
a
religion
is
not
a
proposition
but
a
system
it
is
a
rite
a
creed
a
philosophy
a
rule
of
duty
all
at
once
and
to
accept
a
religion
is
neither
a
simple
assent
to
it
nor
a
complex
neither
a
conviction
nor
a
prejudice
neither
a
notional
assent
nor
a
real
not
a
mere
act
of
profession
nor
of
credence
nor
of
opinion
nor
of
speculation
but
it
is
a
collection
of
all
these
various
kinds
of
assents
some
of
one
description
some
of
another
but
out
of
all
these
different
assents
how
many
are
of
that
kind
which
i
have
called
certitude
certitudes
indeed
do
not
change
but
who
shall
pretend
that
assents
are
indefectible
for
instance
the
fundamental
dogma
of
protestantism
is
the
exclusive
authority
of
holy
scripture
but
in
holding
this
a
protestant
holds
a
host
of
propositions
explicitly
or
implicitly
and
holds
them
with
assents
of
various
character
among
these
propositions
he
holds
that
scripture
is
the
divine
revelation
itself
that
it
is
inspired
that
nothing
is
known
in
doctrine
but
what
is
there
that
the
church
has
no
authority
in
matters
of
doctrine
that
as
claiming
it
it
condemned
long
ago
in
the
apocalypse
that
john
wrote
the
apocalypse
that
justification
is
by
faith
only
that
our
lord
is
god
that
there
are
generations
between
adam
and
our
lord
now
of
which
out
of
all
these
propositions
is
he
certain
and
to
how
many
of
them
is
his
assent
of
one
and
the
same
description
his
belief
that
scripture
is
commensurate
with
the
divine
revelation
is
perhaps
implicit
not
conscious
as
to
inspiration
he
does
not
well
know
what
the
word
means
and
his
assent
is
scarcely
more
than
a
profession
that
no
doctrine
is
true
but
what
can
be
proved
from
scripture
he
understands
and
his
assent
to
it
is
what
i
have
called
speculative
that
the
church
has
no
authority
he
holds
with
a
real
assent
or
belief
that
the
church
is
condemned
in
the
apocalypse
is
a
standing
prejudice
that
john
wrote
the
apocalypse
is
his
opinion
that
justification
is
by
faith
only
he
accepts
but
scarcely
can
be
said
to
apprehend
that
our
lord
is
god
perhaps
he
is
certain
that
there
are
generations
between
adam
and
christ
he
accepts
on
credence
yet
if
he
were
asked
the
question
he
would
most
probably
answer
that
he
was
certain
of
the
truth
of
protestantism
though
protestantism
means
these
things
and
a
hundred
more
all
at
once
and
though
he
believes
with
actual
certitude
only
one
of
them
all
indeed
a
dogma
of
most
sacred
importance
but
not
the
discovery
of
luther
or
calvin
he
would
think
it
enough
to
say
that
he
was
a
foe
to
romanism
and
socinianism
and
to
avow
that
he
gloried
in
the
reformation
he
looks
upon
each
of
these
religious
professions
protestantism
romanism
socinianism
and
theism
merely
as
units
as
if
they
were
not
each
made
up
of
many
elements
as
if
they
had
nothing
in
common
as
if
a
transition
from
the
one
to
the
other
involved
a
simple
obliteration
of
all
that
had
been
as
yet
written
on
his
mind
and
would
be
the
reception
of
a
new
faith
when
then
we
are
told
that
a
man
has
changed
from
one
religion
to
another
the
first
question
which
we
have
to
ask
is
have
the
first
and
the
second
religions
nothing
in
common
if
they
have
common
doctrines
he
has
changed
only
a
portion
of
his
creed
not
the
whole
and
the
next
question
is
has
he
ever
made
much
of
those
doctrines
which
are
common
to
his
new
creed
and
his
old
and
then
again
what
doctrines
was
he
certain
of
among
the
old
and
what
among
the
new
thus
of
three
protestants
one
becomes
a
catholic
a
second
a
unitarian
and
a
third
an
unbeliever
how
is
this
the
first
becomes
a
catholic
because
he
assented
as
a
protestant
to
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
s
divinity
with
a
real
assent
and
a
genuine
conviction
and
because
this
certitude
taking
possession
of
his
mind
led
him
on
to
welcome
the
catholic
doctrines
of
the
real
presence
and
of
the
theotocos
till
his
protestantism
fell
off
from
him
and
he
submitted
himself
to
the
church
the
second
became
a
unitarian
because
proceeding
on
the
principle
that
scripture
was
the
rule
of
faith
and
that
a
man
s
private
judgment
was
its
rule
of
interpretation
and
finding
that
the
doctrine
of
the
nicene
and
athanasian
creeds
did
not
follow
by
logical
necessity
from
the
text
of
scripture
he
said
to
himself
the
word
of
god
has
been
made
of
none
effect
by
the
traditions
of
men
and
therefore
nothing
was
left
for
him
but
to
profess
what
he
considered
primitive
christianity
and
to
become
a
humanitarian
the
third
gradually
subsided
into
infidelity
because
he
started
with
the
protestant
dogma
cherished
in
the
depths
of
his
nature
that
a
priesthood
was
a
corruption
of
the
simplicity
of
the
gospel
first
then
he
would
protest
against
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
next
he
gave
up
baptismal
regeneration
and
the
sacramental
principle
then
he
asked
himself
whether
dogmas
were
not
a
restraint
on
christian
liberty
as
well
as
sacraments
then
came
the
question
what
after
all
was
the
use
of
teachers
of
religion
why
should
any
one
stand
between
him
and
his
maker
after
a
time
it
struck
him
that
this
obvious
question
had
to
be
answered
by
the
apostles
as
well
as
by
the
anglican
clergy
so
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
true
and
only
revelation
of
god
to
man
is
that
which
is
written
on
the
heart
this
did
for
a
time
and
he
remained
a
deist
but
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
inward
moral
law
was
there
within
the
breast
whether
there
was
a
god
or
not
and
that
it
was
a
roundabout
way
of
enforcing
that
law
to
say
that
it
came
from
god
and
simply
unnecessary
considering
it
carried
with
it
its
own
sacred
and
sovereign
authority
as
our
feelings
instinctively
testified
and
when
he
turned
to
look
at
the
physical
world
around
him
he
really
did
not
see
what
scientific
proof
there
was
there
of
the
being
of
god
at
all
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
all
things
would
go
on
quite
as
well
as
at
present
without
that
hypothesis
as
with
it
so
he
dropped
it
and
became
a
atheist
now
the
world
will
say
that
in
these
three
cases
old
certitudes
were
lost
and
new
were
gained
but
it
is
not
so
each
of
the
three
men
started
with
just
one
certitude
as
he
would
have
himself
professed
had
he
examined
himself
narrowly
and
he
carried
it
out
and
carried
it
with
him
into
a
new
system
of
belief
he
was
true
to
that
one
conviction
from
first
to
last
and
on
looking
back
on
the
past
would
perhaps
insist
upon
this
and
say
he
had
really
been
consistent
all
through
when
others
made
much
of
his
great
changes
in
religious
opinion
he
has
indeed
made
serious
additions
to
his
initial
ruling
principle
but
he
has
lost
no
conviction
of
which
he
was
originally
possessed
i
will
take
one
more
instance
a
man
is
converted
to
the
catholic
church
from
his
admiration
of
its
religious
system
and
his
disgust
with
protestantism
that
admiration
remains
but
after
a
time
he
leaves
his
new
faith
perhaps
returns
to
his
old
the
reason
if
we
may
conjecture
may
sometimes
be
this
he
has
never
believed
in
the
church
s
infallibility
in
her
doctrinal
truth
he
has
believed
but
in
her
infallibility
no
he
was
asked
before
he
was
received
whether
he
held
all
that
the
church
taught
he
replied
he
did
but
he
understood
the
question
to
mean
whether
he
held
those
particular
doctrines
which
at
that
time
the
church
in
matter
of
fact
formally
taught
whereas
it
really
meant
whatever
the
church
then
or
at
any
future
time
should
thus
he
never
had
the
indispensable
and
elementary
faith
of
a
catholic
and
was
simply
no
subject
for
reception
into
the
fold
of
the
church
this
being
the
case
when
the
immaculate
conception
is
defined
he
feels
that
it
is
something
more
than
he
bargained
for
when
he
became
a
catholic
and
accordingly
he
gives
up
his
religious
profession
the
world
will
say
that
he
has
lost
his
certitude
of
the
divinity
of
the
catholic
faith
but
he
never
had
it
the
first
point
to
be
ascertained
then
when
we
hear
of
a
change
of
religious
certitude
in
another
is
what
the
doctrines
are
on
which
his
certitude
before
now
and
at
present
has
respectively
fallen
all
doctrines
besides
these
were
the
accidents
of
his
profession
and
the
indefectibility
of
certitude
would
not
be
disproved
though
he
changed
them
every
year
there
are
few
religions
which
have
no
points
in
common
and
these
whether
true
or
false
when
embraced
with
an
absolute
conviction
are
the
pivots
on
which
changes
take
place
in
that
collection
of
credences
opinions
prejudices
and
other
assents
which
make
up
what
is
called
a
man
s
selection
and
adoption
of
a
form
of
religion
a
denomination
or
a
church
there
have
been
protestants
whose
idea
of
enlightened
christianity
has
been
a
strenuous
antagonism
to
what
they
consider
the
unmanliness
and
unreasonableness
of
catholic
morality
an
antipathy
to
the
precepts
of
patience
meekness
forgiveness
of
injuries
and
chastity
all
this
they
have
considered
a
woman
s
religion
the
ornament
of
monks
of
the
sick
the
feeble
and
the
old
lust
revenge
ambition
courage
pride
these
they
have
fancied
made
the
man
and
want
of
them
the
slave
no
one
could
fairly
accuse
such
men
of
any
great
change
of
their
convictions
or
refer
to
them
in
proof
of
the
defectibility
of
certitude
if
they
were
one
day
found
to
have
taken
up
the
profession
of
islam
and
if
this
intercommunion
of
religions
holds
good
even
when
the
common
points
between
them
are
but
errors
held
in
common
much
more
natural
will
be
the
transition
from
one
religion
to
another
without
injury
to
existing
certitudes
when
the
common
points
the
objects
of
those
certitudes
are
truths
and
still
stronger
in
that
case
and
more
constraining
will
be
the
sympathy
with
which
minds
that
love
truth
even
when
they
have
surrounded
it
with
error
will
yearn
towards
the
catholic
faith
which
contains
within
itself
and
claims
as
its
own
all
truth
that
is
elsewhere
to
be
found
and
more
than
all
and
nothing
but
truth
this
is
the
secret
of
the
influence
by
which
the
church
draws
to
herself
converts
from
such
various
and
conflicting
religions
they
come
not
to
lose
what
they
have
but
to
gain
what
they
have
not
and
in
order
that
by
means
of
what
they
have
more
may
be
given
to
them
augustine
tells
us
that
there
is
no
false
teaching
without
an
intermixture
of
truth
and
it
is
by
the
light
of
those
particular
truths
contained
respectively
in
the
various
religions
of
men
and
by
our
certitudes
about
them
which
are
possible
wherever
those
truths
are
found
that
we
pick
our
way
slowly
perhaps
but
surely
into
the
one
religion
which
god
has
given
taking
our
certitudes
with
us
not
to
lose
but
to
keep
them
more
securely
and
to
understand
and
love
their
objects
more
perfectly
not
even
are
idolaters
and
heathen
out
of
the
range
of
some
of
these
religious
truths
and
their
correlative
certitudes
the
old
greek
and
roman
polytheists
had
as
they
show
in
their
literature
clear
and
strong
notions
nay
vivid
mental
images
of
a
particular
providence
of
the
power
of
prayer
of
the
rule
of
divine
governance
of
the
law
of
conscience
of
sin
and
guilt
of
expiation
by
means
of
sacrifices
and
of
future
retribution
i
will
even
add
of
the
unity
and
personality
of
the
supreme
being
this
it
is
that
throws
such
a
magnificent
light
over
the
homeric
poems
the
tragic
choruses
and
the
odes
of
pindar
and
it
has
its
counterpart
in
the
philosophy
of
socrates
and
of
the
stoics
and
in
such
historians
as
herodotus
it
would
be
out
of
place
to
speak
confidently
of
a
state
of
society
which
has
passed
away
but
at
first
sight
it
does
not
appear
why
the
truths
which
i
have
enumerated
should
not
have
received
as
genuine
and
deliberate
an
assent
on
the
part
of
socrates
or
cleanthes
of
course
with
divine
aids
but
they
do
not
enter
into
this
discussion
as
was
given
to
them
by
john
or
paul
nay
an
assent
which
rose
to
certitude
much
more
safely
may
it
be
pronounced
of
a
mahometan
that
he
may
have
a
certitude
of
the
divine
unity
as
well
as
a
christian
and
of
a
jew
that
he
may
believe
as
truly
as
a
christian
in
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
of
a
unitarian
that
he
can
give
a
deliberate
and
real
assent
to
the
fact
of
a
supernatural
revelation
to
the
christian
miracles
to
the
eternal
moral
law
and
to
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
so
again
a
protestant
may
not
only
in
words
but
in
mind
and
heart
hold
as
if
he
were
a
catholic
with
simple
certitude
the
doctrines
of
the
holy
trinity
of
the
fall
of
man
of
the
need
of
regeneration
of
the
efficacy
of
divine
grace
and
of
the
possibility
and
danger
of
falling
away
and
thus
it
is
conceivable
that
a
man
might
travel
in
his
religious
profession
all
the
way
from
heathenism
to
catholicity
through
mahometanism
judaism
unitarianism
protestantism
and
anglicanism
without
any
one
certitude
lost
but
with
a
continual
accumulation
of
truths
which
claimed
from
him
and
elicited
in
his
intellect
fresh
and
fresh
certitudes
in
saying
all
this
i
do
not
forget
that
the
same
doctrines
as
held
in
different
religions
may
be
and
often
are
held
very
differently
as
belonging
to
distinct
wholes
or
as
they
are
called
and
exposed
to
the
influence
and
the
bias
of
the
teaching
perhaps
false
with
which
they
are
associated
thus
for
instance
whatever
be
the
resemblance
between
augustine
s
doctrine
of
predestination
and
the
tenet
of
calvin
upon
it
the
two
really
differ
from
each
other
in
significance
and
effect
in
consequence
of
the
place
they
hold
in
the
systems
in
which
they
are
respectively
incorporated
just
as
shades
and
tints
show
so
differently
in
a
painting
according
to
the
masses
of
colour
to
which
they
are
attached
but
in
spite
of
this
a
man
may
so
hold
the
doctrine
of
personal
election
as
a
calvinist
as
to
be
able
still
to
hold
it
as
a
catholic
however
i
have
been
speaking
of
certitudes
which
remain
unimpaired
or
rather
confirmed
by
a
change
of
religion
on
the
contrary
there
are
others
whether
we
call
them
certitudes
or
convictions
which
perish
in
the
change
as
paul
s
conviction
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
jewish
law
came
to
an
end
on
his
becoming
a
christian
now
how
is
such
a
series
of
facts
to
be
reconciled
with
the
doctrine
which
i
have
been
enforcing
what
conviction
could
be
stronger
than
the
faith
of
the
jews
in
the
perpetuity
of
the
mosaic
system
those
then
it
may
be
said
who
abandoned
judaism
for
the
gospel
surely
in
so
doing
bore
the
most
emphatic
of
testimonies
to
the
defectibility
of
certitude
and
in
like
manner
a
mahometan
may
be
so
deeply
convinced
that
mahomet
is
the
prophet
of
god
that
it
would
be
only
by
a
quibble
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
certitude
that
we
could
maintain
that
on
his
becoming
a
catholic
he
did
not
unequivocally
prove
that
certitude
is
defectible
and
it
may
be
argued
perhaps
in
the
case
of
some
members
of
the
church
of
england
that
their
faith
in
the
validity
of
anglican
orders
and
the
invisibility
of
the
church
s
unity
is
so
absolute
so
deliberate
that
their
abandonment
of
it
did
they
become
catholics
or
sceptics
would
be
tantamount
to
the
abandonment
of
a
certitude
now
in
meeting
this
difficulty
i
will
not
urge
lest
i
should
be
accused
of
quibbling
that
certitude
is
a
conviction
of
what
is
true
and
that
these
certitudes
have
come
to
nought
because
their
objects
being
errors
not
truths
they
really
were
not
certitudes
at
all
nor
will
i
insist
as
i
might
that
they
ought
to
be
proved
first
to
be
something
more
than
mere
prejudices
assents
without
reason
and
judgment
before
they
can
fairly
be
taken
as
instances
of
the
defectibility
of
certitude
but
i
simply
ask
as
regards
the
zeal
of
the
jews
for
the
sufficiency
of
their
law
even
though
it
implied
genuine
certitude
not
a
prejudice
not
a
mere
conviction
still
was
such
zeal
such
professed
certitude
found
in
those
who
were
eventually
converted
or
in
those
who
were
not
for
if
those
who
had
not
that
certitude
became
christians
and
those
who
had
it
remained
jews
then
loss
of
certitude
in
the
latter
is
not
instanced
in
the
fact
of
the
conversion
of
the
former
paul
certainly
is
an
exception
but
his
conversion
as
also
his
was
miraculous
ordinarily
speaking
it
was
not
the
zealots
who
supplied
members
to
the
catholic
church
but
those
men
of
good
will
who
instead
of
considering
the
law
as
perfect
and
eternal
looked
for
the
redemption
of
israel
and
for
the
knowledge
of
salvation
in
the
remission
of
and
in
like
manner
as
to
those
learned
and
devout
men
among
the
anglicans
at
the
present
day
who
come
so
near
the
church
without
acknowledging
her
claims
i
ask
whether
there
are
not
two
classes
among
them
also
who
are
looking
out
beyond
their
own
body
for
the
perfect
way
and
those
on
the
other
hand
who
teach
that
the
anglican
communion
is
the
golden
mean
between
men
who
believe
too
much
and
men
who
believe
too
little
the
centre
of
unity
to
which
east
and
west
are
destined
to
gravitate
the
instrument
and
the
mould
as
the
jews
might
think
of
their
own
moribund
institutions
through
which
the
kingdom
of
christ
is
to
be
established
all
over
the
earth
and
next
i
would
ask
which
of
these
two
classes
supplies
converts
to
the
church
for
if
they
come
from
among
those
who
never
professed
to
be
quite
certain
of
the
special
strength
of
the
anglican
position
such
men
can
not
be
quoted
as
instances
of
the
defectibility
of
certitude
there
is
indeed
another
class
of
beliefs
of
which
i
must
take
notice
the
failure
of
which
may
be
taken
at
first
sight
as
a
proof
that
certitude
may
be
lost
yet
they
clearly
deserve
no
other
name
than
prejudices
as
being
founded
upon
reports
of
facts
or
on
arguments
which
will
not
bear
careful
examination
such
was
the
disgust
felt
towards
our
predecessors
in
primitive
times
the
christians
of
the
first
centuries
as
a
secret
society
as
a
conspiracy
against
the
civil
power
as
a
set
of
mean
sordid
despicable
fanatics
as
monsters
revelling
in
blood
and
impurity
such
also
is
the
deep
prejudice
now
existing
against
the
church
among
protestants
who
dress
her
up
in
the
most
hideous
and
loathsome
images
which
rightly
attach
in
the
prophetic
descriptions
to
the
evil
spirit
his
agents
and
instruments
and
so
of
the
numberless
calumnies
directed
against
individual
catholics
against
our
religious
bodies
and
men
in
authority
which
serve
to
feed
and
sustain
the
suspicion
and
dislike
with
which
everything
catholic
is
regarded
in
this
country
but
as
a
persistence
in
such
prejudices
is
no
evidence
of
their
truth
so
an
abandonment
of
them
is
no
evidence
that
certitude
can
fail
there
is
yet
another
class
of
prejudices
against
the
catholic
religion
which
is
far
more
tolerable
and
intelligible
than
those
on
which
i
have
been
dwelling
but
still
in
no
sense
certitudes
indeed
i
doubt
whether
they
would
be
considered
more
than
presumptive
opinions
by
the
persons
who
entertain
them
such
is
the
idea
which
has
possessed
certain
philosophers
ancient
and
modern
that
miracles
are
an
infringement
and
disfigurement
of
the
beautiful
order
of
nature
such
too
is
the
persuasion
common
among
political
and
literary
men
that
the
catholic
church
is
inconsistent
with
the
true
interests
of
the
human
race
with
social
progress
with
rational
freedom
with
good
government
a
renunciation
of
these
imaginations
is
not
a
change
in
certitudes
so
much
on
this
subject
all
concrete
laws
are
general
and
persons
as
such
do
not
fall
under
laws
still
i
have
gone
a
good
way
as
i
think
to
remove
the
objections
to
the
doctrine
of
the
indefectibility
of
certitude
in
matters
of
religion
one
further
remark
may
be
made
certitude
does
not
admit
of
an
interior
immediate
test
sufficient
to
discriminate
it
from
false
certitude
such
a
test
is
rendered
impossible
from
the
circumstance
that
when
we
make
the
mental
act
expressed
by
i
know
we
sum
up
the
whole
series
of
reflex
judgments
which
might
each
in
turn
successively
exercise
a
critical
function
towards
those
of
the
series
which
precede
it
but
still
if
it
is
the
general
rule
that
certitude
is
indefectible
will
not
that
indefectibility
itself
become
at
least
in
the
event
a
criterion
of
the
genuineness
of
the
certitude
or
is
there
any
rival
state
or
habit
of
the
intellect
which
claims
to
be
indefectible
also
a
few
words
will
suffice
to
answer
these
questions
premising
that
all
rules
are
but
general
especially
those
which
relate
to
the
mind
i
observe
that
indefectibility
may
at
least
serve
as
a
negative
test
of
certitude
or
quâ
condition
so
that
whoever
loses
his
conviction
on
a
given
point
is
thereby
proved
not
to
have
been
certain
of
it
certitude
ought
to
stand
all
trials
or
it
is
not
certitude
its
very
office
is
to
cherish
and
maintain
its
object
and
its
very
lot
and
duty
is
to
sustain
rude
shocks
in
maintenance
of
it
without
being
damaged
by
them
i
will
take
an
example
let
us
suppose
we
are
told
on
an
unimpeachable
authority
that
a
man
whom
we
saw
die
is
now
alive
again
and
at
his
work
as
it
was
his
wont
to
be
let
us
suppose
we
actually
see
him
and
converse
with
him
what
will
become
of
our
certitude
of
his
death
i
do
not
think
we
should
give
it
up
how
could
we
when
we
actually
saw
him
die
at
first
indeed
we
should
be
thrown
into
an
astonishment
and
confusion
so
great
that
the
world
would
seem
to
reel
round
us
and
we
should
be
ready
to
give
up
the
use
of
our
senses
and
of
our
memory
of
our
reflective
powers
and
of
our
reason
and
even
to
deny
our
power
of
thinking
and
our
existence
itself
such
confidence
have
we
in
the
doctrine
that
when
life
goes
it
never
returns
nor
would
our
bewilderment
be
less
when
the
first
blow
was
over
but
our
reason
would
rally
and
with
our
reason
our
certitude
would
come
back
to
us
whatever
came
of
it
we
should
never
cease
to
know
and
to
confess
to
ourselves
both
of
the
contrary
facts
that
we
saw
him
die
and
that
after
dying
we
saw
him
alive
again
the
overpowering
strangeness
of
our
experience
would
have
no
power
to
shake
our
certitude
in
the
facts
which
created
it
again
let
us
suppose
for
argument
s
sake
that
ethnologists
philologists
anatomists
and
antiquarians
agreed
together
in
separate
demonstrations
that
there
were
half
a
dozen
races
of
men
and
that
they
were
all
descended
from
gorillas
or
chimpanzees
or
or
baboons
moreover
that
adam
was
an
historical
personage
with
a
surroundings
and
date
in
a
comparatively
modern
world
on
the
other
hand
let
me
believe
that
the
word
of
god
himself
distinctly
declares
that
there
were
no
men
before
adam
that
he
was
immediately
made
out
of
the
slime
of
the
earth
and
that
he
is
the
first
father
of
all
men
that
are
or
ever
have
been
here
is
a
contradiction
of
statements
more
direct
than
in
the
former
instance
the
two
can
not
stand
together
one
or
other
of
them
is
untrue
but
whatever
means
i
might
be
led
to
take
for
making
if
possible
the
antagonism
tolerable
i
conceive
i
should
never
give
up
my
certitude
in
that
truth
which
on
sufficient
grounds
i
determined
to
come
from
heaven
if
i
so
believed
i
should
not
pretend
to
argue
or
to
defend
myself
to
others
i
should
be
patient
i
should
look
for
better
days
but
i
should
still
believe
if
indeed
i
had
hitherto
only
half
believed
if
i
believed
with
an
assent
short
of
certitude
or
with
an
acquiescence
short
of
assent
or
hastily
or
on
light
grounds
then
the
case
would
be
altered
but
if
after
full
consideration
and
availing
myself
of
my
best
lights
i
did
think
that
beyond
all
question
god
spoke
as
i
thought
he
did
philosophers
and
experimentalists
might
take
their
course
for
me
should
consider
that
they
and
i
thought
and
reasoned
in
different
mediums
and
that
my
certitude
was
as
little
in
collision
with
them
or
damaged
by
them
as
if
they
attempted
to
counteract
in
some
great
matter
chemical
action
by
the
force
of
gravity
or
to
weigh
magnetic
influence
against
capillary
attraction
of
course
i
am
putting
an
impossible
case
for
philosophical
discoveries
can
not
really
contradict
divine
revelation
so
much
on
the
indefectibility
of
certitude
as
to
the
question
whether
any
other
assent
is
indefectible
besides
it
i
think
prejudice
may
be
such
but
it
can
not
be
confused
with
certitude
for
the
one
is
an
assent
previous
to
rational
grounds
and
the
other
an
assent
given
expressly
after
careful
examination
it
seems
then
that
on
the
whole
there
are
three
conditions
of
certitude
that
it
follows
on
investigation
and
proof
that
it
is
accompanied
by
a
specific
sense
of
intellectual
satisfaction
and
repose
and
that
it
is
irreversible
if
the
assent
is
made
without
rational
grounds
it
is
a
rash
judgment
a
fancy
or
a
prejudice
if
without
the
sense
of
finality
it
is
scarcely
more
than
an
inference
if
without
permanence
it
is
a
mere
conviction
chapter
viii
inference
formal
inference
inference
is
the
conditional
acceptance
of
a
proposition
assent
is
the
unconditional
the
object
of
assent
is
a
truth
the
object
of
inference
is
the
or
a
verisimilitude
the
problem
which
i
have
undertaken
is
that
of
ascertaining
how
it
comes
to
pass
that
a
conditional
act
leads
to
an
unconditional
and
having
now
shown
that
assent
really
is
unconditional
i
proceed
to
show
how
inferential
exercises
as
such
always
must
be
conditional
we
reason
when
we
hold
this
by
virtue
of
that
whether
we
hold
it
as
evident
or
as
approximating
or
tending
to
be
evident
in
either
case
we
so
hold
it
because
of
holding
something
else
to
be
evident
or
tending
to
be
evident
in
the
next
place
our
reasoning
ordinarily
presents
itself
to
our
mind
as
a
simple
act
not
a
process
or
series
of
acts
we
apprehend
the
antecedent
and
then
apprehend
the
consequent
without
explicit
recognition
of
the
medium
connecting
the
two
as
if
by
a
sort
of
direct
association
of
the
first
thought
with
the
second
we
proceed
by
a
sort
of
instinctive
perception
from
premiss
to
conclusion
i
call
it
instinctive
not
as
if
the
faculty
were
one
and
the
same
to
all
men
in
strength
and
quality
as
we
generally
conceive
of
instinct
but
because
ordinarily
or
at
least
often
it
acts
by
a
spontaneous
impulse
as
prompt
and
inevitable
as
the
exercise
of
sense
and
memory
we
perceive
external
objects
and
we
remember
past
events
without
knowing
how
we
do
so
and
in
like
manner
we
reason
without
effort
and
intention
or
any
necessary
consciousness
of
the
path
which
the
mind
takes
in
passing
from
antecedent
to
conclusion
such
is
ratiocination
in
what
may
be
called
a
state
of
nature
as
it
is
found
in
the
uneducated
in
all
men
in
its
ordinary
exercise
nor
is
there
any
antecedent
ground
for
determining
that
it
will
not
be
as
correct
in
its
informations
as
it
is
instinctive
as
trustworthy
as
are
sensible
perception
and
memory
though
its
informations
are
not
so
immediate
and
have
a
wider
range
by
means
of
sense
we
gain
knowledge
directly
by
means
of
reasoning
we
gain
it
indirectly
that
is
by
virtue
of
a
previous
knowledge
and
if
we
may
justly
regard
the
universe
according
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
one
whole
we
may
also
believe
justly
that
to
know
one
part
of
it
is
necessarily
to
know
much
more
than
that
one
part
this
thought
leads
us
to
a
further
view
of
ratiocination
the
proverb
says
ex
pede
herculem
and
we
have
actual
experience
how
the
practised
zoologist
can
build
up
some
intricate
organization
from
the
sight
of
its
smallest
bone
evoking
the
whole
as
if
it
were
a
remembrance
how
again
a
philosophical
antiquarian
by
means
of
an
inscription
interprets
the
mythical
traditions
of
former
ages
and
makes
the
past
live
and
how
a
columbus
is
led
from
considerations
which
are
common
property
and
fortuitous
phenomena
which
are
successively
brought
to
his
notice
to
have
such
faith
in
a
western
world
as
willingly
to
commit
himself
to
the
terrors
of
a
mysterious
ocean
in
order
to
arrive
at
it
that
which
the
mind
is
able
thus
variously
to
bring
together
into
unity
must
have
some
real
intrinsic
connexion
of
part
with
part
but
if
this
is
thus
one
whole
it
must
be
constructed
on
definite
principles
and
laws
the
knowledge
of
which
will
enlarge
our
capacity
of
reasoning
about
it
in
particulars
we
are
led
on
to
aim
at
determining
on
a
large
scale
and
on
system
what
even
gifted
or
practised
intellects
are
only
able
by
their
own
personal
vigour
to
reach
and
fitfully
that
is
at
substituting
scientific
methods
such
as
all
may
use
for
the
action
of
individual
genius
there
is
another
reason
for
attempting
to
discover
an
instrument
of
reasoning
that
is
of
gaining
new
truths
by
means
of
old
which
may
be
less
vague
and
arbitrary
than
the
talent
and
experience
of
the
few
or
the
of
the
many
as
memory
is
not
always
accurate
and
has
on
that
account
led
to
the
adoption
of
writing
as
being
a
unaffected
by
the
failure
of
mental
impressions
our
senses
at
times
deceive
us
and
have
to
be
corrected
by
each
other
so
is
it
also
with
our
reasoning
faculty
the
conclusions
of
one
man
are
not
the
conclusions
of
another
those
of
the
same
man
do
not
always
agree
together
those
of
ever
so
many
who
agree
together
may
differ
from
the
facts
themselves
which
those
conclusions
are
intended
to
ascertain
in
consequence
it
becomes
a
necessity
if
it
be
possible
to
analyze
the
process
of
reasoning
and
to
invent
a
method
which
may
act
as
a
common
measure
between
mind
and
mind
as
a
means
of
joint
investigation
and
as
a
recognized
intellectual
standard
standard
such
as
to
secure
us
against
hopeless
mistakes
and
to
emancipate
us
from
the
capricious
of
authority
as
the
index
on
the
dial
notes
down
the
sun
s
course
in
the
heavens
as
a
key
revolving
through
the
intricate
wards
of
the
lock
opens
for
us
a
so
let
us
if
we
can
provide
ourselves
with
some
ready
expedient
to
serve
as
a
true
record
of
the
system
of
objective
truth
and
an
available
rule
for
interpreting
its
phenomena
or
at
least
let
us
go
as
far
as
we
can
in
providing
it
one
such
experimental
key
is
the
science
of
geometry
which
in
a
certain
department
of
nature
substitutes
a
collection
of
true
principles
fruitful
and
interminable
in
consequences
for
the
guesses
re
of
our
intellect
and
saves
it
both
the
labour
and
the
risk
of
guessing
another
far
more
subtle
and
effective
instrument
is
algebraical
science
which
acts
as
a
spell
in
unlocking
for
us
without
merit
or
effort
of
our
own
individually
the
of
the
concrete
physical
universe
a
more
ambitious
because
a
more
comprehensive
contrivance
still
for
interpreting
the
concrete
world
is
the
method
of
logical
inference
what
we
desiderate
is
something
which
may
supersede
the
need
of
personal
gifts
by
a
and
infallible
rule
now
without
external
symbols
to
mark
out
and
to
steady
its
course
the
intellect
runs
wild
but
with
the
aid
of
symbols
as
in
algebra
it
advances
with
precision
and
effect
let
then
our
symbols
be
words
let
all
thought
be
arrested
and
embodied
in
words
let
language
have
a
monopoly
of
thought
and
thought
go
for
only
so
much
as
it
can
show
itself
to
be
worth
in
language
let
every
prompting
of
the
intellect
be
ignored
every
of
argument
be
disowned
which
is
unprovided
with
an
equivalent
wording
as
its
ticket
for
sharing
in
the
common
search
after
truth
let
the
authority
of
nature
experience
genius
go
for
nothing
ratiocination
thus
restricted
and
put
into
grooves
is
what
i
have
called
inference
and
the
science
which
is
its
regulating
principle
is
logic
the
first
step
in
the
inferential
method
is
to
throw
the
question
to
be
decided
into
the
form
of
a
proposition
then
to
throw
the
proof
itself
into
propositions
the
force
of
the
proof
lying
in
the
comparison
of
these
propositions
with
each
other
when
the
analysis
is
carried
out
fully
and
put
into
form
it
becomes
the
aristotelic
syllogism
however
an
inference
need
not
be
expressed
thus
technically
an
enthymeme
fulfils
the
requirements
of
what
i
have
called
inference
so
does
any
other
form
of
words
with
the
mere
grammatical
expressions
for
therefore
supposing
so
that
similarly
and
the
like
verbal
reasoning
of
whatever
kind
as
opposed
to
mental
is
what
i
mean
by
inference
which
differs
from
logic
only
inasmuch
as
logic
is
its
scientific
form
and
it
will
be
more
convenient
here
to
use
the
two
words
indiscriminately
for
i
snail
say
nothing
about
logic
which
does
not
in
its
substance
also
apply
to
inference
logical
inference
then
being
such
and
its
office
such
as
i
have
described
the
question
follows
how
far
it
answers
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
used
it
proposes
to
provide
both
a
test
and
a
common
measure
of
reasoning
and
i
think
it
will
be
found
partly
to
succeed
and
partly
to
fail
succeeding
so
far
as
words
can
in
fact
be
found
for
representing
the
countless
varieties
and
subtleties
of
human
thought
failing
on
account
of
the
fallacy
of
the
original
assumption
that
whatever
can
be
thought
can
be
adequately
expressed
in
words
in
the
first
place
inference
being
conditional
is
hampered
with
other
propositions
besides
that
which
is
especially
its
own
that
is
with
the
premisses
as
well
as
the
conclusion
and
with
the
rules
connecting
the
latter
with
the
former
it
views
its
own
proper
proposition
in
the
medium
of
prior
propositions
and
measures
it
by
them
it
does
not
hold
a
proposition
for
its
own
sake
but
as
dependent
upon
others
and
those
others
it
entertains
for
the
sake
of
the
conclusion
thus
it
is
practically
far
more
concerned
with
the
comparison
of
propositions
than
with
the
propositions
themselves
it
is
obliged
to
regard
all
the
propositions
with
which
it
has
to
do
not
so
much
for
their
own
sake
as
for
the
sake
of
each
other
as
regards
the
identity
or
likeness
independence
or
dissimilarity
which
has
to
be
mutually
predicated
of
them
it
follows
from
this
that
the
more
simple
and
definite
are
the
words
of
a
proposition
and
the
narrower
their
meaning
and
the
more
that
meaning
in
each
proposition
is
restricted
to
the
relation
which
it
has
to
the
words
of
the
other
propositions
compared
with
it
other
words
the
nearer
the
propositions
concerned
in
the
inference
approach
to
being
mental
abstractions
and
the
less
they
have
to
do
with
the
concrete
reality
and
the
more
closely
they
are
made
to
express
exact
intelligible
comprehensible
communicable
notions
and
the
less
they
stand
for
objective
things
that
is
the
more
they
are
the
subjects
not
of
real
but
of
notional
apprehension
much
the
more
suitable
do
they
become
for
the
purposes
of
inference
hence
it
is
that
no
process
of
argument
is
so
perfect
as
that
which
is
conducted
by
means
of
symbols
in
arithmetic
is
and
just
and
never
anything
else
but
it
never
is
it
has
no
tendency
to
change
its
meaning
and
to
become
it
has
no
portion
quality
admixture
of
in
its
meaning
and
under
all
circumstances
is
times
and
the
sum
of
and
nor
can
the
whole
world
supply
anything
to
throw
doubt
upon
these
elementary
positions
it
is
not
so
with
language
take
by
contrast
the
word
inference
which
i
have
been
using
it
may
stand
for
the
act
of
inferring
as
i
have
used
it
or
for
the
connecting
principle
or
between
premisses
and
conclusions
or
for
the
conclusion
itself
and
sometimes
it
will
be
difficult
in
a
particular
sentence
to
say
which
it
bears
of
these
three
senses
and
so
again
in
algebra
is
never
or
anything
but
wherever
it
is
found
and
and
are
always
standard
quantities
to
which
and
are
always
to
be
referred
and
by
which
they
are
always
to
be
measured
in
geometry
again
the
subjects
of
argument
points
lines
and
surfaces
are
precise
creations
of
the
mind
suggested
indeed
by
external
objects
but
meaning
nothing
but
what
they
are
defined
to
mean
they
have
no
colour
no
motion
no
heat
no
qualities
which
address
themselves
to
the
ear
or
to
the
palate
so
that
in
whatever
combinations
or
relations
the
words
denoting
them
occur
and
to
whomsoever
they
come
those
words
never
vary
in
their
meaning
but
are
just
of
the
same
measure
and
weight
at
one
time
and
at
another
what
is
true
of
arithmetic
algebra
and
geometry
is
true
also
of
aristotelic
argumentation
in
its
typical
modes
and
figures
it
compares
two
given
words
separately
with
a
third
and
then
determines
how
they
stand
towards
each
other
in
a
identity
of
sense
in
consequence
its
formal
process
is
best
conducted
by
means
of
symbols
a
b
and
while
it
keeps
to
these
it
is
safe
it
has
the
cogency
of
mathematical
reasoning
and
draws
its
conclusions
by
a
rule
as
unerring
as
it
is
blind
symbolical
notation
then
being
the
perfection
of
the
syllogistic
method
it
follows
that
when
words
are
substituted
for
symbols
it
will
be
its
aim
to
circumscribe
and
stint
their
import
as
much
as
possible
lest
perchance
a
should
not
always
exactly
mean
a
and
b
mean
b
and
to
make
them
as
much
as
possible
the
of
notions
which
are
in
our
absolute
power
as
meaning
just
what
we
choose
them
to
mean
and
as
little
as
possible
the
tokens
of
real
things
which
are
outside
of
us
and
which
mean
we
do
not
know
how
much
but
so
much
certainly
as
may
run
away
with
us
in
proportion
as
we
enter
into
them
beyond
the
range
of
scientific
management
the
concrete
matter
of
propositions
is
a
constant
source
of
trouble
to
syllogistic
reasoning
as
marring
the
simplicity
and
perfection
of
its
process
words
which
denote
things
have
innumerable
implications
but
in
inferential
exercises
it
is
the
very
triumph
of
that
clearness
and
hardness
of
head
which
is
the
characteristic
talent
for
the
art
to
have
stripped
them
of
all
these
connatural
senses
to
have
drained
them
of
that
depth
and
breadth
of
associations
which
constitute
their
poetry
their
rhetoric
and
their
historical
life
to
have
starved
each
term
down
till
it
has
become
the
ghost
of
itself
and
everywhere
one
and
the
same
ghost
omnibus
umbra
locis
so
that
it
may
stand
for
just
one
unreal
aspect
of
the
concrete
thing
to
which
it
properly
belongs
for
a
relation
a
generalization
or
other
abstraction
for
a
notion
neatly
turned
out
of
the
laboratory
of
the
mind
and
sufficiently
tame
and
subdued
because
existing
only
in
a
definition
thus
it
is
that
the
logician
for
his
own
purposes
and
most
usefully
as
far
as
those
purposes
are
concerned
turns
rivers
full
winding
and
beautiful
into
navigable
canals
to
him
dog
or
horse
is
not
a
thing
which
he
sees
but
a
mere
name
suggesting
ideas
and
by
dog
or
horse
universal
he
means
not
the
aggregate
of
all
individual
dogs
or
horses
brought
together
but
a
common
aspect
meagre
but
precise
of
all
existing
or
possible
dogs
or
horses
which
all
the
while
does
not
really
correspond
to
any
one
single
dog
or
horse
out
of
the
whole
aggregate
such
minute
fidelity
in
the
representation
of
individuals
is
neither
necessary
nor
possible
to
his
art
his
business
is
not
to
ascertain
facts
in
the
concrete
but
to
find
and
dress
up
middle
terms
and
provided
they
and
the
extremes
which
they
go
between
are
not
equivocal
either
in
themselves
or
in
their
use
and
he
can
enable
his
pupils
to
show
well
in
a
disputation
or
in
a
popular
harangue
or
in
a
written
dissertation
he
has
achieved
the
main
purpose
of
his
profession
such
are
the
characteristics
of
reasoning
viewed
as
a
science
or
scientific
art
or
inferential
process
and
we
might
anticipate
that
narrow
as
by
necessity
is
its
field
of
view
for
that
reason
its
pretensions
to
be
demonstrative
were
incontrovertible
in
a
certain
sense
they
really
are
so
while
we
talk
logic
we
are
unanswerable
but
then
on
the
other
hand
this
universal
living
scene
of
things
is
after
all
as
little
a
logical
world
as
it
is
a
poetical
and
as
it
can
not
without
violence
be
exalted
into
poetical
perfection
neither
can
it
be
attenuated
into
a
logical
formula
abstract
can
only
conduct
to
abstract
but
we
have
need
to
attain
by
our
reasonings
to
what
is
concrete
and
the
margin
between
the
abstract
conclusions
of
the
science
and
the
concrete
facts
which
we
wish
to
ascertain
will
be
found
to
reduce
the
force
of
the
inferential
method
from
demonstration
to
the
mere
determination
of
the
probable
thus
whereas
as
i
have
already
said
inference
starts
with
conditions
as
starting
with
premisses
here
are
two
reasons
why
when
employed
upon
matters
of
fact
it
can
only
conclude
probabilities
first
because
its
premisses
are
assumed
not
proved
and
secondly
because
its
conclusions
are
abstract
and
not
concrete
i
will
now
consider
these
two
points
separately
inference
comes
short
of
proof
in
concrete
matters
because
it
has
not
a
full
command
over
the
objects
to
which
it
relates
but
merely
assumes
its
premisses
in
order
to
complete
the
proof
we
are
thrown
upon
some
previous
syllogism
or
syllogisms
in
which
the
assumptions
may
be
proved
and
then
still
farther
back
we
are
thrown
upon
others
again
to
prove
the
new
assumptions
of
that
second
order
of
syllogisms
where
is
this
process
to
stop
especially
since
it
must
run
upon
separated
divergent
and
multiplied
lines
of
argument
the
farther
the
investigation
is
carried
back
at
length
a
score
of
propositions
present
themselves
all
to
be
proved
by
propositions
more
evident
than
themselves
in
order
to
enable
them
respectively
to
become
premisses
to
that
series
of
inferences
which
terminates
in
the
conclusion
which
we
originally
drew
but
even
now
the
difficulty
is
not
at
an
end
it
would
be
something
to
arrive
at
length
at
premisses
which
are
undeniable
however
long
we
might
be
in
arriving
at
them
but
in
this
case
the
long
retrospection
lodges
us
at
length
at
what
are
called
first
principles
the
recondite
sources
of
all
knowledge
as
to
which
logic
provides
no
common
measure
of
minds
are
accepted
by
some
rejected
by
others
which
and
not
in
the
syllogistic
exhibitions
lies
the
whole
problem
of
attaining
to
truth
which
are
called
by
their
respective
advocates
because
they
are
evident
in
no
other
way
one
of
the
two
uses
contemplated
in
reasoning
by
rule
or
in
verbal
argumentation
was
as
i
have
said
to
establish
a
standard
of
truth
and
to
supersede
the
of
authority
how
does
it
fulfil
this
end
if
it
only
leads
us
back
to
first
principles
about
which
there
is
interminable
controversy
we
are
not
able
to
prove
by
syllogism
that
there
are
any
propositions
at
all
but
supposing
there
are
as
of
course
i
hold
there
are
still
who
can
determine
these
by
logic
syllogism
then
though
of
course
it
has
its
use
still
does
only
the
minutest
and
easiest
part
of
the
work
in
the
investigation
of
truth
for
when
there
is
any
difficulty
that
difficulty
commonly
lies
in
determining
first
principles
not
in
the
arrangement
of
proofs
even
when
argument
is
the
most
direct
and
severe
of
its
kind
there
must
be
those
assumptions
in
the
process
which
resolve
themselves
into
the
conditions
of
human
nature
but
how
many
more
assumptions
does
that
process
in
ordinary
concrete
matters
involve
subtle
assumptions
not
directly
arising
out
of
these
primary
conditions
but
accompanying
the
course
of
reasoning
step
by
step
and
traceable
to
the
sentiments
of
the
age
country
religion
social
habits
and
ideas
of
the
particular
inquirers
or
disputants
and
passing
current
without
detection
because
admitted
equally
on
all
hands
and
to
these
must
be
added
the
assumptions
which
are
made
from
the
necessity
of
the
case
in
consequence
of
the
prolixity
and
elaborateness
of
any
argument
which
should
faithfully
note
down
all
the
propositions
which
go
to
make
it
up
we
recognize
this
tediousness
even
in
the
case
of
the
theorems
of
euclid
though
mathematical
proof
is
comparatively
simple
logic
then
does
not
really
prove
it
enables
us
to
join
issue
with
others
it
suggests
ideas
it
opens
views
it
maps
out
for
us
the
lines
of
thought
it
verifies
negatively
it
determines
when
differences
of
opinion
are
hopeless
and
when
and
how
far
conclusions
are
probable
but
for
genuine
proof
in
concrete
matter
we
require
an
more
delicate
versatile
and
elastic
than
verbal
argumentation
i
ought
to
give
an
illustration
of
what
i
have
been
stating
in
general
terms
but
it
is
difficult
to
do
so
without
a
digression
however
if
it
must
be
i
look
round
the
room
in
which
i
happen
to
be
writing
and
take
down
the
first
book
which
catches
my
eye
it
is
an
old
volume
of
a
magazine
of
great
name
i
open
it
at
random
and
fall
upon
a
discussion
about
the
then
lately
discovered
emendations
of
the
text
of
shakespeare
it
will
do
for
my
purpose
in
the
account
of
falstaff
s
death
in
henry
act
ii
scene
we
read
according
to
the
received
text
the
words
his
nose
was
as
sharp
as
a
pen
and
a
babbled
of
green
in
the
first
authentic
edition
published
in
some
years
after
shakespeare
s
death
the
words
i
believe
ran
and
a
table
of
green
fields
which
has
no
sense
accordingly
an
anonymous
critic
reported
by
theobald
in
the
last
century
corrected
them
to
and
a
talked
of
green
fields
theobald
himself
improved
the
reading
into
and
a
babbled
of
green
fields
which
since
his
time
has
been
the
received
text
but
just
twenty
years
ago
an
annotated
copy
of
the
edition
of
was
found
annotated
perhaps
by
a
contemporary
which
among
as
many
as
corrections
of
the
text
substituted
for
the
corrupt
reading
of
the
words
on
a
table
of
green
frieze
which
has
a
sufficient
sense
though
far
less
acceptable
to
an
admirer
of
shakespeare
than
theobald
s
the
genuineness
of
this
copy
with
its
annotations
as
it
is
presented
to
us
i
shall
here
take
for
granted
now
i
understand
or
at
least
will
suppose
the
argument
maintained
in
the
article
of
the
magazine
in
question
to
run
thus
theobald
s
reading
as
at
present
received
is
to
be
retained
to
the
exclusion
of
the
text
of
and
of
the
emendation
made
on
the
copy
of
the
edition
of
the
exclusion
of
the
text
of
because
that
text
is
corrupt
to
the
exclusion
of
the
annotation
of
because
it
is
i
wish
it
then
observed
how
many
large
questions
are
opened
in
the
discussion
which
ensues
how
many
recondite
and
untractable
principles
have
to
be
settled
and
how
impotent
is
logic
or
any
reasonings
which
can
be
thrown
into
language
to
deal
with
these
indispensable
first
principles
the
first
position
is
the
authoritative
reading
of
is
not
to
be
restored
to
the
received
text
because
it
is
now
are
we
to
take
it
for
granted
as
a
first
principle
which
needs
no
proof
that
a
text
may
be
tampered
with
because
it
is
corrupt
however
the
corrupt
reading
arose
it
is
authoritative
it
is
found
in
an
edition
published
by
known
persons
only
six
years
after
shakespeare
s
death
from
his
own
manuscript
as
it
appears
and
with
his
corrections
of
earlier
faulty
impressions
authority
can
not
sanction
nonsense
but
it
can
forbid
critics
from
experimentalizing
upon
it
if
the
text
of
shakespeare
is
corrupt
it
should
be
published
as
corrupt
i
believe
the
best
editors
of
the
greek
tragedians
have
given
up
the
impertinence
of
introducing
their
conjectures
into
the
text
and
a
classic
like
shakespeare
has
a
right
to
be
treated
with
the
same
respect
as
æschylus
to
this
it
will
be
replied
that
shakespeare
is
for
the
general
public
and
æschylus
for
students
of
a
dead
language
that
the
run
of
men
read
for
amusement
or
as
a
recreation
and
that
if
the
editions
of
shakespeare
were
made
on
critical
principles
they
would
remain
unsold
here
then
we
are
brought
to
the
question
whether
it
is
any
advantage
to
read
shakespeare
except
with
the
care
and
pains
which
a
classic
demands
and
whether
he
is
in
fact
read
at
all
by
those
whom
such
critical
exactness
would
offend
and
thus
we
are
led
on
to
further
questions
about
cultivation
of
mind
and
the
education
of
the
masses
further
the
question
presents
itself
whether
the
general
admiration
of
shakespeare
is
genuine
whether
it
is
not
a
mere
fashion
whether
the
multitude
of
men
understand
him
at
all
whether
it
is
not
true
that
every
one
makes
much
of
him
because
every
one
else
makes
much
of
him
can
we
possibly
make
shakespeare
light
reading
especially
in
this
day
of
cheap
novels
by
ever
so
much
correction
of
his
text
now
supposing
this
point
settled
and
the
text
of
put
out
of
court
then
comes
the
claim
of
the
annotator
to
introduce
into
shakespeare
s
text
the
emendation
made
upon
his
copy
of
the
edition
of
why
is
he
not
of
greater
authority
than
theobald
the
inventor
of
the
received
reading
and
his
emendation
of
more
authority
than
theobald
s
if
the
corrupt
reading
must
any
how
be
got
out
of
the
way
why
should
not
the
annotator
rather
than
theobald
determine
its
substitute
for
what
we
know
the
authority
of
the
anonymous
annotator
may
be
very
great
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
he
was
not
a
contemporary
of
the
poet
and
if
so
the
question
arises
what
is
the
character
of
his
emendations
are
they
his
own
private
and
arbitrary
conjectures
or
are
they
informations
from
those
who
knew
shakespeare
traditions
of
the
theatre
of
the
actors
or
spectators
of
his
plays
here
then
we
are
involved
in
intricate
questions
which
can
only
be
decided
by
a
minute
examination
of
the
emendations
so
industriously
brought
together
by
this
anonymous
critic
but
it
is
obvious
that
a
verbal
argumentation
upon
corrections
is
impossible
there
must
be
first
careful
processes
of
perusal
classification
discrimination
selection
which
mainly
are
acts
of
the
mind
without
the
intervention
of
language
there
must
be
a
cumulation
of
arguments
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
of
which
only
the
heads
or
the
results
can
be
put
upon
paper
next
come
in
questions
of
criticism
and
taste
with
their
recondite
and
disputable
premisses
and
the
usual
deductions
from
them
so
subtle
and
difficult
to
follow
all
this
being
considered
am
i
wrong
in
saying
that
though
controversy
is
both
possible
and
useful
at
all
times
yet
it
is
not
adequate
to
this
occasion
rather
that
that
of
argument
whether
for
or
against
the
annotator
which
is
furnished
by
his
numerous
emendations
what
may
be
called
the
multiform
evidential
fact
in
which
the
examination
of
these
emendations
results
rather
to
be
photographed
on
the
individual
mind
as
by
one
impression
than
admits
of
delineation
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
many
in
any
known
or
possible
language
however
rich
in
vocabulary
and
flexible
in
structure
and
now
as
to
the
third
point
which
presents
itself
for
consideration
the
claim
of
theobald
s
emendation
to
retain
its
place
in
the
it
strikes
me
with
wonder
that
an
argument
in
its
defence
could
have
been
put
forward
to
the
following
effect
viz
that
true
though
it
be
that
the
editors
of
are
of
much
more
authority
than
theobald
and
that
the
annotator
s
reading
in
the
passage
in
question
is
more
likely
to
be
correct
than
theobald
s
nevertheless
theobald
s
has
by
this
time
acquired
a
prescriptive
right
to
its
place
there
the
prescription
of
more
than
a
hundred
years
usurpation
has
become
legitimacy
that
theobald
s
words
have
sunk
into
the
hearts
of
thousands
that
in
fact
they
have
become
shakespeare
s
that
it
would
be
a
dangerous
innovation
and
an
evil
precedent
to
touch
them
if
we
begin
an
unsettlement
of
the
popular
mind
where
is
it
to
stop
thus
it
appears
in
order
to
do
justice
to
the
question
before
us
we
have
to
betake
ourselves
to
the
consideration
of
myths
pious
frauds
and
other
grave
matters
which
introduce
us
into
a
dense
and
intricate
of
first
principles
and
elementary
phenomena
belonging
to
the
domains
of
archeology
and
theology
nor
is
this
all
when
such
views
of
the
duty
of
garbling
a
classic
are
propounded
they
open
upon
us
a
long
vista
of
sceptical
interrogations
which
go
far
to
disparage
the
claims
upon
us
the
genius
the
very
existence
of
the
great
poet
to
whose
honour
these
views
are
intended
to
minister
for
perhaps
after
all
shakespeare
is
really
but
a
collection
of
many
theobalds
who
have
each
of
them
a
right
to
his
own
share
of
him
there
was
a
great
dramatic
school
in
his
day
he
was
one
of
a
number
of
artists
they
wrote
in
common
how
are
we
to
know
what
is
his
or
how
much
are
the
best
parts
his
or
the
worst
it
is
said
that
the
players
put
in
what
is
vulgar
and
offensive
in
his
writings
perhaps
they
inserted
the
beauties
i
have
heard
it
urged
years
ago
as
an
objection
to
sheridan
s
claim
of
authorship
to
the
plays
which
bear
his
name
that
they
were
so
unlike
each
other
is
not
this
the
very
peculiarity
of
those
imputed
to
shakespeare
were
ever
the
writings
of
one
man
so
various
so
impersonal
can
we
form
any
one
true
idea
of
what
he
was
in
history
or
character
by
means
of
them
is
he
not
in
short
et
præterea
then
again
in
corroboration
is
there
any
author
s
life
so
deficient
in
biographical
notices
as
his
we
know
about
hooker
spenser
spelman
raleigh
harvey
his
contemporaries
what
do
we
know
of
shakespeare
is
he
much
more
than
a
name
is
not
the
traditional
object
of
an
englishman
s
idolatry
after
all
a
nebula
of
genius
destined
like
homer
to
be
resolved
into
its
separate
and
independent
luminaries
as
soon
as
we
have
a
criticism
powerful
enough
for
the
purpose
i
must
not
be
supposed
for
a
moment
to
countenance
such
scepticism
myself
it
is
a
subject
worthy
the
attention
of
a
sceptical
age
here
i
have
introduced
it
simply
to
suggest
how
many
words
go
to
make
up
a
thoroughly
valid
argument
how
short
and
easy
a
way
to
a
true
conclusion
is
the
logic
of
good
sense
how
little
syllogisms
have
to
do
with
the
formation
of
opinion
how
little
depends
upon
the
inferential
proofs
and
how
much
upon
those
beliefs
and
views
in
which
men
either
already
agree
with
each
other
or
hopelessly
differ
before
they
begin
to
dispute
and
which
are
hidden
deep
in
our
nature
or
it
may
be
in
our
personal
peculiarities
so
much
on
the
multiplicity
of
assumptions
which
in
spite
of
formal
exactness
logical
reasoning
in
concrete
matters
is
forced
to
admit
and
on
the
consequent
uncertainty
which
attends
its
conclusions
now
i
come
to
the
second
reason
why
its
conclusions
are
thus
wanting
in
precision
in
this
world
of
sense
we
have
to
do
with
things
far
more
than
with
notions
we
are
not
solitary
left
to
the
contemplation
of
our
own
thoughts
and
their
legitimate
developments
we
are
surrounded
by
external
beings
and
our
enunciations
are
directed
to
the
concrete
we
reason
in
order
to
enlarge
our
knowledge
of
matters
which
do
not
depend
on
us
for
being
what
they
are
but
how
is
an
exercise
of
mind
which
is
for
the
most
part
occupied
with
notions
not
things
competent
to
deal
with
things
except
partially
and
indirectly
this
is
the
main
reason
why
an
inference
however
fully
worded
except
perhaps
in
some
peculiar
cases
which
are
out
of
place
here
never
can
reach
so
far
as
to
ascertain
a
fact
as
i
have
already
said
arguments
about
the
abstract
can
not
handle
and
determine
the
concrete
they
may
approximate
to
a
proof
but
they
only
reach
the
probable
because
they
can
not
reach
the
particular
even
in
mathematical
physics
a
margin
is
left
for
possible
imperfection
in
the
investigation
when
the
planet
neptune
was
discovered
it
was
deservedly
considered
a
triumph
of
science
that
abstract
reasonings
had
done
so
much
towards
determining
the
planet
and
its
orbit
there
would
have
been
no
triumph
in
success
had
there
been
no
hazard
of
failure
it
is
no
triumph
to
euclid
in
pure
mathematics
that
the
geometrical
conclusions
of
his
second
book
can
be
worked
out
and
verified
by
algebra
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
are
almost
mathematical
in
their
precision
but
there
is
a
multitude
of
matters
to
which
mathematical
science
is
applied
which
are
in
their
nature
intricate
and
obscure
and
require
that
reasoning
by
rule
should
be
completed
by
the
living
mind
who
would
be
satisfied
with
a
navigator
or
engineer
who
had
no
practice
or
experience
whereby
to
carry
on
his
scientific
conclusions
out
of
their
native
abstract
into
the
concrete
and
the
real
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
distrust
which
is
ordinarily
felt
of
speculators
and
theorists
but
this
that
they
are
dead
to
the
necessity
of
personal
prudence
and
judgment
to
qualify
and
complete
their
logic
science
working
by
itself
reaches
truth
in
the
abstract
and
probability
in
the
concrete
but
what
we
aim
at
is
truth
in
the
concrete
this
is
true
of
other
inferences
besides
mathematical
they
come
to
no
definite
conclusions
about
matters
of
fact
except
as
they
are
made
effectual
for
their
purpose
by
the
living
intelligence
which
uses
them
all
men
have
their
price
fabricius
is
a
man
he
has
his
price
but
he
had
not
his
price
how
is
this
because
he
is
more
than
a
universal
because
he
falls
under
other
universals
because
universals
are
ever
at
war
with
each
other
because
what
is
called
a
universal
is
only
a
general
because
what
is
only
general
does
not
lead
to
a
necessary
conclusion
let
us
judge
him
by
another
universal
men
have
a
conscience
fabricius
is
a
man
he
has
a
until
we
have
actual
experience
of
fabricius
we
can
only
say
that
since
he
is
a
man
perhaps
he
will
take
a
bribe
and
perhaps
he
will
not
latet
dolus
in
generalibus
they
are
arbitrary
and
fallacious
if
we
take
them
for
more
than
broad
views
and
aspects
of
things
serving
as
our
notes
and
indications
for
judging
of
the
particular
but
not
absolutely
touching
and
determining
facts
let
units
come
first
and
universals
second
let
universals
minister
to
units
not
units
be
sacrificed
to
universals
john
richard
and
robert
are
individual
things
independent
incommunicable
we
may
find
some
kind
of
common
measure
between
them
and
we
may
give
it
the
name
of
man
man
as
such
the
typical
man
the
we
are
justified
in
so
doing
and
in
investing
it
with
general
attributes
and
bestowing
on
it
what
we
consider
a
definition
but
we
think
we
may
go
on
to
impose
our
definition
on
the
whole
race
and
to
every
member
of
it
to
the
thousand
johns
richards
and
roberts
who
are
found
in
it
no
each
of
them
is
what
he
is
in
spite
of
it
not
any
one
of
them
is
man
as
such
or
coincides
with
the
another
john
is
not
necessarily
rational
because
all
men
are
rational
for
he
may
be
an
idiot
because
man
is
a
being
of
progress
does
the
second
richard
progress
for
he
may
be
a
dunce
because
man
is
made
for
society
must
we
therefore
go
on
to
deny
that
the
second
robert
is
a
gipsy
or
a
bandit
as
he
is
found
to
be
there
is
no
such
thing
as
stereotyped
humanity
it
must
ever
be
a
vague
bodiless
idea
because
the
concrete
units
from
which
it
is
formed
are
independent
realities
general
laws
are
not
inviolable
truths
much
less
are
they
necessary
causes
since
as
a
rule
men
are
rational
progressive
and
social
there
is
a
high
probability
of
this
rule
being
true
in
the
case
of
a
particular
person
but
we
must
know
him
to
be
sure
of
it
each
thing
has
its
own
nature
and
its
own
history
when
the
nature
and
the
history
of
many
things
are
similar
we
say
that
they
have
the
same
nature
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
one
and
the
same
nature
they
are
each
of
them
itself
not
identical
but
like
a
law
is
not
a
fact
but
a
notion
all
men
die
therefore
elias
has
died
but
he
has
not
died
and
did
not
die
he
was
an
exception
to
the
general
law
of
humanity
so
far
he
did
not
come
under
that
law
but
under
the
law
so
to
say
of
elias
it
was
the
peculiarity
of
his
individuality
that
he
left
the
world
without
dying
what
right
have
we
to
subject
the
person
of
elias
to
the
scientific
notion
of
an
abstract
humanity
which
we
have
formed
without
asking
his
leave
why
must
the
tyrant
majority
find
a
rule
for
his
history
but
all
men
are
mortal
not
so
what
is
really
meant
is
that
man
as
such
is
mortal
or
the
abstract
typical
therefore
the
minor
premiss
ought
to
be
elias
was
the
or
abstract
man
but
he
was
not
and
could
not
be
the
abstract
man
nor
could
any
one
else
any
more
than
the
average
man
of
an
insurance
company
is
every
individual
man
who
insures
his
life
with
it
such
a
syllogism
proves
nothing
about
the
veritable
elias
except
in
the
way
of
antecedent
probability
if
it
be
said
that
elias
was
exempted
from
death
not
by
nature
but
by
miracle
what
is
this
to
the
purpose
undeniable
as
it
is
still
to
have
this
miraculous
exemption
was
the
personal
prerogative
of
elias
we
call
it
miracle
because
god
ordinarily
acts
otherwise
he
who
causes
men
in
general
to
die
gave
to
elias
not
to
die
this
miraculous
gift
comes
into
the
individuality
of
elias
on
this
individuality
we
must
fix
our
thoughts
and
not
begin
our
notion
of
him
by
ignoring
it
he
was
a
man
and
something
more
than
man
and
if
we
do
not
take
this
into
account
we
fall
into
an
initial
error
in
our
thoughts
of
him
what
is
true
of
elias
is
true
of
every
one
in
his
own
place
and
degree
we
call
rationality
the
distinction
of
man
when
compared
with
other
animals
this
is
true
in
logic
but
in
fact
a
man
differs
from
a
brute
not
in
rationality
only
but
in
all
that
he
is
even
in
those
respects
in
which
he
is
most
like
a
brute
so
that
his
whole
self
his
bones
limbs
make
life
reason
moral
feeling
immortality
and
all
that
he
is
besides
is
his
real
in
contrast
to
a
horse
or
a
dog
and
in
like
manner
as
regards
john
and
richard
when
compared
with
one
another
each
is
himself
and
nothing
else
and
though
regarded
abstractedly
the
two
may
fairly
be
said
to
have
something
in
common
viz
that
abstract
sameness
which
does
not
exist
at
all
yet
strictly
speaking
they
have
nothing
in
common
for
each
of
them
has
a
vested
interest
in
all
that
he
himself
is
and
moreover
what
seems
to
be
common
in
the
two
becomes
in
fact
so
uncommon
so
in
their
respective
bodily
frame
of
each
is
so
singled
out
from
all
other
bodies
by
its
special
constitution
sound
or
weak
by
its
vitality
activity
pathological
history
and
changes
and
again
the
mind
of
each
is
so
distinct
from
all
other
minds
in
disposition
powers
and
habits
instead
of
saying
as
logicians
say
that
the
two
men
differ
only
in
number
we
ought
i
repeat
rather
to
say
that
they
differ
from
each
other
in
all
that
they
are
in
identity
in
incommunicability
in
personality
nor
does
any
real
thing
admit
by
any
calculus
of
logic
of
being
dissected
into
all
the
possible
general
notions
which
it
admits
nor
in
consequence
of
being
recomposed
out
of
them
though
the
attempt
thus
to
treat
it
is
more
unpromising
in
proportion
to
the
intricacy
and
completeness
of
its
make
we
can
not
see
through
any
one
of
the
myriad
beings
which
make
up
the
universe
or
give
the
full
catalogue
of
its
belongings
we
are
accustomed
indeed
and
rightly
to
speak
of
the
creator
himself
as
incomprehensible
and
indeed
he
is
so
by
an
incommunicable
attribute
but
in
a
certain
sense
each
of
his
creatures
is
incomprehensible
to
us
also
in
the
sense
that
no
one
has
a
perfect
understanding
of
it
but
he
we
recognize
and
appropriate
aspects
of
them
and
logic
is
useful
to
us
in
registering
these
aspects
and
what
they
imply
but
it
does
not
give
us
to
know
even
one
individual
being
so
much
on
logical
argumentation
and
in
speaking
of
the
syllogism
i
have
spoken
of
all
inferential
processes
whatever
as
expressed
in
language
if
they
are
such
as
to
be
reducible
to
science
for
they
all
require
general
notions
as
conditions
of
their
coming
to
a
conclusion
thus
in
the
deductive
argument
europe
has
no
security
for
peace
till
its
large
standing
armies
in
its
separate
states
are
reduced
for
a
large
standing
army
is
in
its
very
idea
provocative
of
war
the
conclusion
is
only
probable
for
it
may
so
be
that
in
no
country
is
that
pure
idea
realized
but
in
every
country
in
concrete
fact
there
may
be
circumstances
political
or
social
which
destroy
the
abstract
dangerousness
so
too
as
regards
induction
and
analogy
as
modes
of
inference
for
whether
i
argue
this
place
will
have
the
cholera
unless
it
is
drained
for
there
are
a
number
of
cases
which
point
to
this
conclusion
or
the
sun
will
rise
for
it
rose
in
either
method
of
reasoning
i
appeal
in
order
to
prove
a
particular
case
to
a
general
principle
or
law
which
has
not
force
enough
to
warrant
more
than
a
probable
conclusion
as
to
the
cholera
the
place
in
question
may
have
certain
antagonist
advantages
which
anticipate
or
neutralize
the
miasma
which
is
the
principle
of
the
poison
and
as
to
the
sun
s
rising
there
was
a
first
day
of
the
sun
s
rising
and
therefore
there
may
be
a
last
this
is
what
i
have
to
say
on
formal
inference
when
taken
to
represent
ratiocination
science
in
all
its
departments
has
too
much
simplicity
and
exactness
from
the
nature
of
the
case
to
be
the
measure
of
fact
in
its
very
perfection
lies
its
incompetency
to
settle
particulars
and
details
as
to
logic
its
chain
of
conclusions
hangs
loose
at
both
ends
both
the
point
from
which
the
proof
should
start
and
the
points
at
which
it
should
arrive
are
beyond
its
reach
it
comes
short
both
of
first
principles
and
of
concrete
issues
even
its
most
elaborate
exhibitions
fail
to
represent
adequately
the
sum
total
of
considerations
by
which
an
individual
mind
is
determined
in
its
judgment
of
things
even
its
most
careful
combinations
made
to
bear
on
a
conclusion
want
that
steadiness
of
aim
which
is
necessary
for
hitting
it
as
i
said
when
i
began
thought
is
too
keen
and
manifold
its
sources
are
too
remote
and
hidden
its
path
too
personal
delicate
and
circuitous
its
too
various
and
intricate
to
admit
of
the
trammels
of
any
language
of
whatever
subtlety
and
of
whatever
compass
nor
is
it
any
disparagement
of
the
proper
value
of
formal
reasonings
thus
to
speak
of
them
that
they
can
not
proceed
beyond
probabilities
is
most
readily
allowed
by
those
who
use
them
most
philosophers
experimentalists
lawyers
in
their
several
ways
have
commonly
the
reputation
of
being
at
least
on
moral
and
religious
subjects
hard
of
belief
because
proceeding
in
the
necessary
investigation
by
the
analytical
method
of
verbal
inference
they
find
within
its
limits
no
sufficient
resources
for
attaining
a
conclusion
nay
they
do
not
always
find
it
possible
in
their
own
special
province
severally
for
even
when
in
their
hearts
they
have
no
doubt
about
a
conclusion
still
often
from
the
habit
of
their
minds
they
are
reluctant
to
own
it
and
dwell
upon
the
deficiencies
of
the
evidence
or
the
possibility
of
error
because
they
speak
by
rule
and
by
book
though
they
judge
and
determine
by
every
exercise
of
nature
or
of
art
is
good
in
its
place
and
the
uses
of
this
logical
inference
are
manifold
it
is
the
great
principle
of
order
in
our
thinking
it
reduces
a
chaos
into
harmony
it
catalogues
the
accumulations
of
knowledge
it
maps
out
for
us
the
relations
of
its
separate
departments
it
puts
us
in
the
way
to
correct
its
own
mistakes
it
enables
the
independent
intellects
of
many
acting
and
on
each
other
to
bring
their
collective
force
to
bear
upon
one
and
the
same
or
the
same
question
if
language
is
an
inestimable
gift
to
man
the
logical
faculty
prepares
it
for
our
use
though
it
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
ascertain
truth
still
it
teaches
us
the
direction
in
which
truth
lies
and
how
propositions
lie
towards
each
other
nor
is
it
a
slight
benefit
to
know
what
is
probable
and
what
is
not
so
what
is
needed
for
the
proof
of
a
point
what
is
wanting
in
a
theory
how
a
theory
hangs
together
and
what
will
follow
if
it
be
admitted
though
it
does
not
itself
discover
the
unknown
it
is
one
principal
way
by
which
discoveries
are
made
moreover
a
course
of
argument
which
is
simply
conditional
will
point
out
when
and
where
experiment
and
observation
should
be
applied
or
testimony
sought
for
as
often
happens
both
in
physical
and
legal
questions
a
logical
hypothesis
is
the
means
of
holding
facts
together
explaining
difficulties
and
reconciling
the
imagination
to
what
is
strange
and
again
processes
of
logic
are
useful
as
enabling
us
to
get
over
particular
stages
of
an
investigation
speedily
and
surely
as
on
a
journey
we
now
and
then
gain
time
by
travelling
by
night
make
short
cuts
when
the
winds
or
adopt
to
avoid
fatigue
but
reasoning
by
rule
and
in
words
is
too
natural
to
us
to
admit
of
being
regarded
merely
in
the
light
of
utility
our
inquiries
spontaneously
fall
into
scientific
sequence
and
we
think
in
logic
as
we
talk
in
prose
without
aiming
at
doing
so
however
sure
we
are
of
the
accuracy
of
our
instinctive
conclusions
we
as
instinctively
put
them
into
words
as
far
as
we
can
as
preferring
if
possible
to
have
them
in
an
objective
shape
which
we
can
fall
back
upon
for
our
own
satisfaction
then
for
our
justification
with
others
such
a
tangible
defence
of
what
we
hold
inadequate
as
it
necessarily
is
considered
as
an
analysis
of
our
ratiocination
in
its
length
and
breadth
nevertheless
is
in
such
sense
associated
with
our
holdings
and
so
fortifies
and
illustrates
them
that
it
acts
as
a
vivid
apprehension
acts
giving
them
luminousness
and
force
thus
inference
becomes
a
sort
of
symbol
of
assent
and
even
bears
upon
action
i
have
enlarged
on
these
obvious
considerations
lest
i
should
seem
paradoxical
but
they
do
not
impair
the
main
position
of
this
section
that
inference
considered
in
the
shape
of
verbal
argumentation
determines
neither
our
principles
nor
our
ultimate
judgments
it
is
neither
the
test
of
truth
nor
the
adequate
basis
of
assent
informal
inference
it
is
plain
that
formal
logical
sequence
is
not
in
fact
the
method
by
which
we
are
enabled
to
become
certain
of
what
is
concrete
and
it
is
equally
plain
from
what
has
been
already
suggested
what
the
real
and
necessary
method
is
it
is
the
cumulation
of
probabilities
independent
of
each
other
arising
out
of
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
particular
case
which
is
under
review
probabilities
too
fine
to
avail
separately
too
subtle
and
circuitous
to
be
convertible
into
syllogisms
too
numerous
and
various
for
such
conversion
even
were
they
convertible
as
a
man
s
portrait
differs
from
a
sketch
of
him
in
having
not
merely
a
continuous
outline
but
all
its
details
filled
in
and
shades
and
colours
laid
on
and
harmonized
together
such
is
the
multiform
and
intricate
process
of
ratiocination
necessary
for
our
reaching
him
as
a
concrete
fact
compared
with
the
rude
operation
of
syllogistic
treatment
let
us
suppose
i
wish
to
convert
an
educated
thoughtful
protestant
and
accordingly
present
for
his
acceptance
a
syllogism
of
the
following
kind
all
protestants
are
bound
to
join
the
church
you
are
a
protestant
he
answers
we
will
say
by
denying
both
premisses
and
he
does
so
by
means
of
arguments
which
branch
out
into
other
arguments
and
those
into
others
and
all
of
them
severally
requiring
to
be
considered
by
him
on
their
own
merits
before
the
syllogism
reaches
him
and
in
consequence
mounting
up
taken
all
together
into
an
array
of
inferential
exercises
large
and
various
beyond
calculation
moreover
he
is
bound
to
submit
himself
to
this
complicated
process
from
the
nature
of
the
case
he
would
act
rashly
if
he
did
not
for
he
is
a
concrete
individual
unit
and
being
so
is
under
so
many
laws
and
is
the
subject
of
so
many
predications
all
at
once
that
he
can
not
determine
offhand
his
position
and
his
duty
by
the
law
and
the
predication
of
one
syllogism
in
particular
i
mean
he
may
fairly
say
distinguo
to
each
of
its
premisses
he
says
protestants
are
bound
to
join
the
church
circumstances
and
i
am
a
a
certain
sense
and
therefore
the
syllogism
at
first
sight
does
not
touch
him
at
all
before
then
he
grants
the
major
he
asks
whether
all
protestants
really
are
bound
to
join
the
they
bound
in
case
they
do
not
feel
themselves
bound
if
they
are
satisfied
that
their
present
religion
is
a
safe
one
if
they
are
sure
it
is
true
if
on
the
other
hand
they
have
grave
doubts
as
to
the
doctrinal
fidelity
and
purity
of
the
church
if
they
are
convinced
that
the
church
is
corrupt
if
their
conscience
instinctively
rejects
certain
of
its
doctrines
if
history
convinces
them
that
the
pope
s
power
is
not
but
merely
in
the
order
of
providence
if
again
they
are
in
a
heathen
country
where
priests
are
not
or
where
the
only
priest
who
is
to
be
found
exacts
of
them
as
a
condition
of
their
reception
a
profession
which
the
creed
of
pope
pius
iv
says
nothing
about
for
instance
that
the
holy
see
is
fallible
even
when
it
teaches
or
that
the
temporal
power
is
an
corruption
on
one
or
other
of
such
grounds
he
thinks
he
need
not
change
his
religion
but
presently
he
asks
himself
can
a
protestant
be
in
such
a
state
as
to
be
really
satisfied
with
his
religion
as
he
has
just
now
been
professing
can
he
possibly
believe
protestantism
came
from
above
as
a
whole
how
much
of
it
can
he
believe
came
from
above
and
as
to
that
portion
which
he
feels
did
come
from
above
has
it
not
all
been
derived
to
him
from
the
church
when
traced
to
its
source
is
not
protestantism
in
itself
a
negation
did
not
the
church
exist
before
it
and
can
he
be
sure
on
the
other
hand
that
any
one
of
the
church
s
doctrines
is
not
from
above
further
he
finds
he
has
to
make
up
his
mind
what
is
a
corruption
and
what
are
the
tests
of
it
what
he
means
by
a
religion
whether
it
is
obligatory
to
profess
any
religion
in
particular
what
are
the
standards
of
truth
and
falsehood
in
religion
and
what
are
the
special
claims
of
the
church
and
so
again
as
to
the
minor
premiss
perhaps
he
will
answer
that
he
is
not
a
protestant
that
he
is
a
catholic
of
the
early
undivided
church
that
he
is
a
catholic
but
not
a
papist
then
he
has
to
determine
questions
about
division
schism
visible
unity
what
is
essential
what
is
desirable
about
provisional
states
as
to
the
adjustment
of
the
church
s
claims
with
those
of
personal
judgment
and
responsibility
as
to
the
soul
of
the
church
contrasted
with
the
body
as
to
degrees
of
proof
and
the
degree
necessary
for
his
conversion
as
to
what
is
called
his
providential
position
and
the
responsibility
of
change
as
to
the
sincerity
of
his
purpose
to
follow
the
divine
will
whithersoever
it
may
lead
him
as
to
his
intellectual
capacity
of
investigating
such
questions
at
all
none
of
these
questions
as
they
come
before
him
admit
of
simple
demonstration
but
each
carries
with
it
a
number
of
independent
probable
arguments
sufficient
when
united
for
a
reasonable
conclusion
about
itself
and
first
he
determines
that
the
questions
are
such
as
he
personally
with
such
talents
or
attainments
as
he
has
may
fairly
entertain
and
then
he
goes
on
after
deliberation
to
form
a
definite
judgment
upon
them
and
determines
them
one
way
or
another
in
their
bearing
on
the
bald
syllogism
which
was
originally
offered
to
his
acceptance
and
we
will
say
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
he
ought
to
accept
it
as
true
in
his
case
that
he
is
a
protestant
in
such
a
sense
of
such
a
complexion
of
such
knowledge
under
such
circumstances
as
to
be
called
upon
by
duty
to
join
the
church
that
this
is
a
conclusion
of
which
he
can
be
certain
and
ought
to
be
certain
and
that
he
will
be
incurring
grave
responsibility
if
he
does
not
accept
it
as
certain
and
act
upon
the
certainty
of
it
and
to
this
conclusion
he
comes
as
is
plain
not
by
any
possible
verbal
enumeration
of
all
the
considerations
minute
but
abundant
delicate
but
effective
which
unite
to
bring
him
to
it
but
by
a
mental
comprehension
of
the
whole
case
and
a
discernment
of
its
upshot
sometimes
after
much
deliberation
but
it
may
be
by
a
clear
and
rapid
act
of
the
intellect
always
however
by
an
unwritten
something
like
the
summation
of
the
terms
and
of
an
algebraical
series
this
i
conceive
to
be
the
real
method
of
reasoning
in
concrete
matters
and
it
has
these
characteristics
it
does
not
supersede
the
logical
form
of
inference
but
is
one
and
the
same
with
it
only
it
is
no
longer
an
abstraction
but
carried
out
into
the
realities
of
life
its
premisses
being
instinct
with
the
substance
and
the
momentum
of
that
mass
of
probabilities
which
acting
upon
each
other
in
correction
and
confirmation
carry
it
home
definitely
to
the
individual
case
which
is
its
original
scope
next
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
plain
that
such
a
process
of
reasoning
is
more
or
less
implicit
and
without
the
direct
and
full
advertence
of
the
mind
exercising
it
as
by
the
use
of
our
eyesight
we
recognize
two
brothers
yet
without
being
able
to
express
what
it
is
by
which
we
distinguish
them
as
at
first
sight
we
perhaps
confuse
them
together
but
on
better
knowledge
we
see
no
likeness
between
them
at
all
as
it
requires
an
artist
s
eye
to
determine
what
lines
and
shades
make
a
countenance
look
young
or
old
amiable
thoughtful
angry
or
conceited
the
principle
of
discrimination
being
in
each
case
real
but
implicit
is
the
mind
unequal
to
a
complete
analysis
of
the
motives
which
carry
it
on
to
a
particular
conclusion
and
is
swayed
and
determined
by
a
body
of
proof
which
it
recognizes
only
as
a
body
and
not
in
its
constituent
parts
and
thirdly
it
is
plain
that
in
this
investigation
of
the
method
of
concrete
inference
we
have
not
advanced
one
step
towards
depriving
inference
of
its
conditional
character
for
it
is
still
as
dependent
on
premisses
as
it
is
in
its
elementary
idea
on
the
contrary
we
have
rather
added
to
the
obscurity
of
the
problem
for
a
syllogism
is
at
least
a
demonstration
when
the
premisses
are
granted
but
a
cumulation
of
probabilities
over
and
above
their
implicit
character
will
vary
both
in
their
number
and
their
separate
estimated
value
according
to
the
particular
intellect
which
is
employed
upon
it
it
follows
that
what
to
one
intellect
is
a
proof
is
not
so
to
another
and
that
the
certainty
of
a
proposition
does
properly
consist
in
the
certitude
of
the
mind
which
contemplates
it
and
this
of
course
may
be
said
without
prejudice
to
the
objective
truth
or
falsehood
of
propositions
since
it
does
not
follow
that
these
propositions
on
the
one
hand
are
not
true
and
based
on
right
reason
and
those
on
the
other
not
false
and
based
on
false
reason
because
not
all
men
discriminate
them
in
the
same
way
having
thus
explained
the
view
which
i
would
take
of
reasoning
in
the
concrete
viz
that
from
the
nature
of
the
case
and
from
the
constitution
of
the
human
mind
certitude
is
the
result
of
arguments
which
taken
in
the
letter
and
not
in
their
full
implicit
sense
are
but
probabilities
i
proceed
to
dwell
on
some
instances
and
circumstances
of
a
phenomenon
which
seems
to
me
as
undeniable
as
to
many
it
may
be
perplexing
let
us
take
three
instances
belonging
respectively
to
the
present
the
past
and
the
future
we
are
all
absolutely
certain
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
great
britain
is
an
island
we
give
to
that
proposition
our
deliberate
and
unconditional
adhesion
there
is
no
security
on
which
we
should
be
better
content
to
stake
our
interests
our
property
our
welfare
than
on
the
fact
that
we
are
living
in
an
island
we
have
no
fear
of
any
geographical
discovery
which
may
reverse
our
belief
we
should
be
amused
or
angry
at
the
assertion
as
a
bad
jest
did
any
one
say
that
we
were
at
this
time
joined
to
the
in
norway
or
in
france
though
a
canal
was
cut
across
the
isthmus
we
are
as
little
exposed
to
the
misgiving
perhaps
we
are
not
on
an
island
after
all
as
to
the
question
is
it
quite
certain
that
the
angle
in
a
is
a
it
is
a
simple
and
primary
truth
with
us
if
any
truth
is
such
to
believe
it
is
as
legitimate
an
exercise
of
assent
as
there
are
legitimate
exercises
of
doubt
or
of
opinion
this
is
the
position
of
our
minds
towards
our
insularity
yet
are
the
arguments
producible
for
it
to
use
the
common
expression
in
black
and
white
commensurate
with
this
overpowering
certitude
about
it
our
reasons
for
believing
that
we
are
circumnavigable
are
such
as
these
we
have
been
so
taught
in
our
childhood
and
it
is
so
in
all
the
maps
next
we
have
never
heard
it
contradicted
or
questioned
on
the
contrary
every
one
whom
we
have
heard
speak
on
the
subject
of
great
britain
every
book
we
have
read
invariably
took
it
for
granted
our
whole
national
history
the
routine
transactions
and
current
events
of
the
country
our
social
and
commercial
system
our
political
relations
with
foreigners
imply
it
in
one
way
or
another
numberless
facts
or
what
we
consider
facts
rest
on
the
truth
of
it
no
received
fact
rests
on
its
being
otherwise
if
there
is
anywhere
a
junction
between
us
and
the
continent
where
is
it
and
how
do
we
know
it
is
it
in
the
north
or
in
the
south
there
is
a
manifest
ad
attached
to
the
notion
that
we
can
be
deceived
on
such
a
point
as
this
however
negative
arguments
and
circumstantial
evidence
are
not
all
in
such
a
matter
which
we
have
a
right
to
require
they
are
not
the
highest
kind
of
proof
possible
those
who
have
circumnavigated
the
island
have
a
right
to
be
certain
have
we
ever
ourselves
even
fallen
in
with
any
one
who
has
and
as
to
the
common
belief
what
is
the
proof
that
we
are
not
all
of
us
believing
it
on
the
credit
of
each
other
and
then
when
it
is
said
that
every
one
believes
it
and
everything
implies
it
how
much
comes
home
to
me
personally
of
this
every
one
and
everything
the
question
is
why
do
i
believe
it
myself
a
living
statesman
is
said
to
have
fancied
demerara
an
island
his
belief
was
an
impression
have
we
personally
more
than
an
impression
if
we
view
the
matter
argumentatively
a
lifelong
impression
about
great
britain
like
the
belief
so
long
and
so
widely
entertained
that
the
earth
was
immovable
and
the
sun
careered
round
it
i
am
not
at
all
insinuating
that
we
are
not
rational
in
our
certitude
i
only
mean
that
we
can
not
analyze
a
proof
satisfactorily
the
result
of
which
good
sense
actually
guarantees
to
us
father
hardouin
maintained
that
terence
s
plays
virgil
s
æneid
horace
s
odes
and
the
histories
of
livy
and
tacitus
were
the
forgeries
of
the
monks
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
he
should
be
able
to
argue
in
behalf
of
such
a
position
shows
of
course
that
the
proof
in
behalf
of
the
received
opinion
is
not
overwhelming
that
is
we
have
no
means
of
inferring
absolutely
that
virgil
s
episode
of
dido
or
of
the
sibyl
and
horace
s
te
quoque
mensorem
and
quem
tu
melpomene
belong
to
that
augustan
age
which
owes
its
celebrity
mainly
to
those
poets
our
however
believes
in
their
genuineness
without
any
hesitation
or
reserve
as
if
it
had
been
demonstrated
and
not
in
proportion
to
the
available
evidence
in
its
favour
or
the
balance
of
arguments
so
much
at
first
sight
what
are
our
grounds
for
dismissing
thus
summarily
as
we
are
likely
to
do
a
theory
such
as
hardouin
s
for
let
it
be
observed
first
that
all
knowledge
of
the
latin
classics
comes
to
us
from
the
medieval
transcriptions
of
them
and
they
who
transcribed
them
had
the
opportunity
of
forging
or
garbling
them
we
are
simply
at
their
mercy
for
neither
by
oral
transmission
nor
by
monumental
inscriptions
nor
by
contemporaneous
manuscripts
are
the
works
of
virgil
horace
and
terence
of
livy
and
tacitus
brought
to
our
knowledge
the
existing
copies
whenever
made
are
to
us
the
autographic
originals
next
it
must
be
considered
that
the
numerous
religious
bodies
then
existing
over
the
face
of
europe
had
leisure
enough
in
the
course
of
a
century
to
compose
not
only
all
the
classics
but
all
the
fathers
too
the
question
is
whether
they
had
the
ability
this
is
the
main
point
on
which
the
inquiry
turns
or
at
least
the
most
obvious
and
it
forms
one
of
those
arguments
which
from
the
nature
of
the
case
are
felt
rather
than
are
convertible
into
syllogisms
hardouin
allows
that
the
georgics
horace
s
satires
and
epistles
and
the
whole
of
cicero
are
genuine
we
have
a
standard
then
in
these
undisputed
compositions
of
the
augustan
age
we
have
a
standard
also
in
the
extant
medieval
works
of
what
the
thirteenth
century
could
do
and
we
see
at
once
how
widely
the
disputed
works
differ
from
the
medieval
now
could
the
thirteenth
century
simulate
augustan
writers
better
than
the
augustan
could
simulate
such
writers
as
those
of
the
thirteenth
no
perhaps
when
the
subject
is
critically
examined
the
question
may
be
brought
to
a
more
simple
issue
but
as
to
our
personal
reasons
for
receiving
as
genuine
the
whole
of
virgil
horace
livy
tacitus
and
terence
they
are
summed
up
in
our
conviction
that
the
monks
had
not
the
ability
to
write
them
that
is
we
take
for
granted
that
we
are
sufficiently
informed
about
the
capabilities
of
the
human
mind
and
the
conditions
of
genius
to
be
quite
sure
that
an
age
which
was
fertile
in
great
ideas
and
in
momentous
elements
of
the
future
robust
in
thought
hopeful
in
its
anticipations
of
singular
intellectual
curiosity
and
acumen
and
of
high
genius
in
at
least
one
of
the
fine
arts
could
not
for
the
very
reason
of
its
in
its
own
line
have
an
equal
in
a
contrary
one
we
do
not
pretend
to
be
able
to
draw
the
line
between
what
the
medieval
intellect
could
or
could
not
do
but
we
feel
sure
that
at
least
it
could
not
write
the
classics
an
instinctive
sense
of
this
and
a
faith
in
testimony
are
the
sufficient
but
the
undeveloped
argument
on
which
to
ground
our
certitude
i
will
add
that
if
we
deal
with
arguments
in
the
mere
letter
the
question
of
the
authorship
of
works
in
any
case
has
much
difficulty
i
have
noticed
it
in
the
instance
of
shakespeare
and
of
newton
we
are
all
certain
that
johnson
wrote
the
prose
of
johnson
and
pope
the
poetry
of
pope
but
what
is
there
but
prescription
at
least
after
contemporaries
are
dead
to
connect
together
the
author
of
the
work
and
the
owner
of
the
name
our
lawyers
prefer
the
examination
of
present
witnesses
to
affidavits
on
paper
but
the
tradition
of
testimonia
such
as
are
prefixed
to
the
classics
and
the
fathers
together
with
the
absence
of
dissentient
voices
is
the
adequate
groundwork
of
our
belief
in
the
history
of
literature
once
more
what
are
my
grounds
for
thinking
that
i
in
my
own
particular
case
shall
die
i
am
as
certain
of
it
in
my
own
innermost
mind
as
i
am
that
i
now
live
but
what
is
the
distinct
evidence
on
which
i
allow
myself
to
be
certain
how
would
it
tell
in
a
court
of
justice
how
should
i
fare
under
a
upon
the
grounds
of
my
certitude
demonstration
of
course
i
can
not
have
of
a
future
event
unless
by
means
of
a
divine
voice
but
what
logical
defence
can
i
make
for
that
undoubting
obstinate
anticipation
of
it
of
which
i
could
not
rid
myself
if
i
tried
first
the
future
can
not
be
proved
therefore
we
are
compelled
by
the
nature
of
the
case
to
put
up
with
arguments
that
is
with
antecedent
probability
which
is
by
itself
no
logical
proof
men
tell
me
that
there
is
a
law
of
death
meaning
by
law
a
necessity
and
i
answer
that
they
are
throwing
dust
into
my
eyes
giving
me
words
instead
of
things
what
is
a
law
but
a
generalized
fact
and
what
power
has
the
past
over
the
future
and
what
power
has
the
case
of
others
over
my
own
case
and
how
many
deaths
have
i
seen
how
many
ocular
witnesses
have
imparted
to
me
their
experience
of
deaths
sufficient
to
establish
what
is
called
a
law
but
let
there
be
a
law
of
death
so
there
is
a
law
we
are
told
that
the
planets
if
let
alone
would
severally
fall
into
the
is
the
centrifugal
law
which
hinders
it
and
so
the
centripetal
law
is
never
carried
out
in
like
manner
i
am
not
under
the
law
of
death
alone
i
am
under
a
thousand
laws
if
i
am
under
one
and
they
thwart
and
counteract
each
other
and
jointly
determine
the
irregular
line
along
which
my
actual
history
runs
divergent
from
the
special
direction
of
any
one
of
them
no
law
is
carried
out
except
in
cases
where
it
acts
freely
how
do
i
know
that
the
law
of
death
will
be
allowed
its
free
action
in
my
particular
case
we
often
are
able
to
avert
death
by
medical
treatment
why
should
death
have
its
effect
sooner
or
later
in
every
case
conceivable
it
is
true
that
the
human
frame
in
all
instances
which
come
before
me
first
grows
and
then
declines
wastes
and
decays
in
visible
preparation
for
dissolution
we
see
death
seldom
but
of
this
decline
we
are
witnesses
daily
still
it
is
a
plain
fact
that
most
men
who
die
die
not
by
any
law
of
death
but
by
the
law
of
disease
and
some
writers
have
questioned
whether
death
is
ever
strictly
speaking
natural
now
are
diseases
necessary
is
there
any
law
that
every
one
sooner
or
later
must
fall
under
the
power
of
disease
and
what
would
happen
on
a
large
scale
were
there
no
diseases
is
what
we
call
the
law
of
death
anything
more
than
the
chance
of
disease
is
the
prospect
of
my
death
in
its
logical
evidence
that
evidence
is
brought
home
to
more
than
a
high
probability
the
strongest
proof
i
have
for
my
inevitable
mortality
is
the
ad
can
i
point
to
the
man
in
historic
times
who
has
lived
his
two
hundred
years
what
has
become
of
past
generations
of
men
unless
it
is
true
that
they
suffered
dissolution
but
this
is
a
circuitous
argument
to
warrant
a
conclusion
to
which
in
matter
of
fact
i
adhere
so
relentlessly
anyhow
there
is
a
considerable
surplusage
as
locke
calls
it
of
belief
over
proof
when
i
determine
that
i
individually
must
die
but
what
logic
can
not
do
my
own
living
personal
reasoning
my
good
sense
which
is
the
healthy
condition
of
such
personal
reasoning
but
which
can
not
adequately
express
itself
in
words
does
for
me
and
i
am
possessed
with
the
most
precise
absolute
masterful
certitude
of
my
dying
some
day
or
other
i
am
led
on
by
these
reflections
to
make
another
remark
if
it
is
difficult
to
explain
how
a
man
knows
that
he
shall
die
is
it
not
more
difficult
for
him
to
satisfy
himself
how
he
knows
that
he
was
born
his
knowledge
about
himself
does
not
rest
on
memory
nor
on
distinct
testimony
nor
on
circumstantial
evidence
can
he
bring
into
one
focus
of
proof
the
reasons
which
make
him
so
sure
i
am
not
speaking
of
scientific
men
who
have
diverse
channels
of
knowledge
but
of
an
ordinary
individual
as
one
of
ourselves
answers
doubtless
may
be
given
to
some
of
these
questions
but
on
the
whole
i
think
it
is
the
fact
that
many
of
our
most
obstinate
and
most
reasonable
certitudes
depend
on
proofs
which
are
informal
and
personal
which
baffle
our
powers
of
analysis
and
can
not
be
brought
under
logical
rule
because
they
can
not
be
submitted
to
logical
statistics
if
we
must
speak
of
law
this
recognition
of
a
correlation
between
certitude
and
implicit
proof
seems
to
me
a
law
of
our
minds
i
said
just
now
that
an
object
of
sense
presents
itself
to
our
view
as
one
whole
and
not
in
its
separate
details
we
take
it
in
recognize
it
and
discriminate
it
from
other
objects
all
at
once
such
too
is
the
intellectual
view
we
take
of
the
of
proof
for
a
concrete
truth
we
grasp
the
full
tale
of
premisses
and
the
conclusion
modum
a
sort
of
instinctive
perception
of
the
legitimate
conclusion
in
and
through
the
premisses
not
by
a
formal
of
propositions
though
of
course
such
a
is
useful
and
natural
both
to
direct
and
to
verify
just
as
in
objects
of
sight
our
notice
of
bodily
peculiarities
or
the
remarks
of
others
may
aid
us
in
establishing
a
case
of
disputed
identity
and
as
this
man
or
that
will
receive
his
own
impression
of
one
and
the
same
person
and
judge
differently
from
others
about
his
countenance
its
expression
its
moral
significance
its
physical
contour
and
complexion
so
an
intellectual
question
may
strike
two
minds
very
differently
may
awaken
in
them
distinct
associations
may
be
invested
by
them
in
contrary
characteristics
and
lead
them
to
opposite
conclusions
so
again
a
body
of
proof
or
a
line
of
argument
may
produce
a
distinct
nay
a
dissimilar
effect
as
addressed
to
one
or
to
the
other
thus
in
concrete
reasonings
we
are
in
great
measure
thrown
back
into
that
condition
from
which
logic
proposed
to
rescue
us
we
judge
for
ourselves
by
our
own
lights
and
on
our
own
principles
and
our
criterion
of
truth
is
not
so
much
the
manipulation
of
propositions
as
the
intellectual
and
moral
character
of
the
person
maintaining
them
and
the
ultimate
silent
effect
of
his
arguments
or
conclusions
upon
our
minds
it
is
this
distinction
between
ratiocination
as
the
exercise
of
a
living
faculty
in
the
individual
intellect
and
mere
skill
in
argumentative
science
which
is
the
true
interpretation
of
the
prejudice
which
exists
against
logic
in
the
popular
mind
and
of
the
animadversions
which
are
levelled
against
it
as
that
its
formulas
make
a
pedant
and
a
that
it
never
makes
converts
that
it
leads
to
rationalism
that
englishmen
are
too
practical
to
be
logical
that
an
ounce
of
goes
farther
than
many
cartloads
of
logic
that
laputa
is
the
land
of
logicians
and
the
like
such
maxims
mean
when
analyzed
that
the
processes
of
reasoning
which
legitimately
lead
to
assent
to
action
to
certitude
are
in
fact
too
multiform
subtle
omnigenous
too
implicit
to
allow
of
being
measured
by
rule
that
they
are
after
all
personal
argumentation
being
useful
only
in
subordination
to
a
higher
logic
it
is
this
which
was
meant
by
the
judge
who
when
asked
for
his
advice
by
a
friend
on
his
being
called
to
important
duties
which
were
new
to
him
bade
him
always
lay
down
the
law
boldly
but
never
give
his
reasons
for
his
decision
was
likely
to
be
right
but
his
reasons
sure
to
be
unsatisfactory
this
is
the
point
which
i
proceed
to
illustrate
i
will
take
a
question
of
the
present
moment
we
shall
have
a
european
war
greece
is
audaciously
defying
how
are
we
to
test
the
validity
of
the
reason
implied
not
expressed
in
the
word
for
only
the
judgment
of
diplomatists
statesmen
capitalists
and
the
like
founded
on
experience
strengthened
by
practical
and
historical
knowledge
controlled
by
can
decide
the
worth
of
that
for
in
relation
to
accepting
or
not
accepting
the
conclusion
which
depends
on
it
the
argument
is
from
concrete
fact
to
concrete
fact
how
will
mere
logical
inferences
which
can
not
proceed
without
general
and
abstract
propositions
help
us
on
to
the
determination
of
this
particular
case
it
is
not
the
case
of
switzerland
attacking
austria
or
of
portugal
attacking
spain
or
of
belgium
attacking
prussia
but
a
case
without
parallels
to
draw
a
scientific
conclusion
the
argument
must
run
somewhat
in
this
way
all
audacious
defiances
of
turkey
on
the
part
of
greece
must
end
in
a
european
war
these
present
acts
of
greece
are
such
ergo
the
major
premiss
is
more
difficult
to
accept
than
the
conclusion
and
the
proof
becomes
an
obscurum
per
but
in
truth
i
should
not
betake
myself
to
some
one
universal
proposition
to
defend
my
view
of
the
matter
i
should
determine
the
particular
case
by
its
particular
circumstances
by
the
combination
of
many
uncatalogued
experiences
floating
in
my
memory
of
many
reflections
variously
produced
felt
rather
than
capable
of
statement
and
if
i
had
them
not
i
should
go
to
those
who
had
i
assent
in
consequence
of
some
such
complex
act
of
judgment
or
from
faith
in
those
who
are
capable
of
making
it
and
practically
syllogism
has
no
part
even
verificatory
in
the
action
of
my
mind
i
take
this
instance
at
random
in
illustration
now
let
me
follow
it
up
by
more
serious
cases
leighton
says
what
a
full
confession
do
we
make
of
our
dissatisfaction
with
the
objects
of
our
bodily
senses
that
in
our
attempts
to
express
what
we
conceive
of
the
best
of
beings
and
the
greatest
of
felicities
to
be
we
describe
by
the
exact
contraries
of
all
that
we
experience
here
one
as
infinite
incomprehensible
immutable
the
other
as
incorruptible
undefiled
and
that
passeth
not
away
at
all
events
this
coincidence
say
rather
identity
of
attributes
is
sufficient
to
apprise
us
that
to
be
inheritors
of
bliss
we
must
become
the
children
of
coleridge
quotes
this
passage
and
adds
another
and
more
fruitful
perhaps
more
solid
inference
from
the
facts
would
be
that
there
is
something
in
the
human
mind
which
makes
it
know
that
in
all
finite
quantity
there
is
an
infinite
in
all
measures
of
time
an
eternal
that
the
latter
are
the
basis
the
substance
of
the
former
and
that
as
we
truly
are
only
as
far
as
god
is
with
us
so
neither
can
we
truly
possess
that
is
enjoy
our
being
or
any
other
real
good
but
by
living
in
the
sense
of
his
holy
presence
what
is
this
an
argument
for
how
few
readers
will
enter
into
either
premiss
or
conclusion
and
of
those
who
understand
what
it
means
will
not
at
least
some
confess
that
they
understand
it
by
fits
and
starts
not
at
all
times
can
we
ascertain
its
force
by
mood
and
figure
is
there
any
royal
road
by
which
we
may
indolently
be
carried
along
into
the
acceptance
of
it
does
not
the
author
rightly
number
it
among
his
aids
for
our
reflection
not
instruments
for
our
compulsion
it
is
plain
that
if
the
passage
is
worth
anything
we
must
secure
that
worth
for
our
own
use
by
the
personal
action
of
our
own
minds
or
else
we
shall
be
only
professing
and
asserting
its
doctrine
without
having
any
ground
or
right
to
assert
it
and
our
preparation
for
understanding
and
making
use
of
it
will
be
the
general
state
of
our
mental
discipline
and
cultivation
our
own
experiences
our
appreciation
of
religious
ideas
the
perspicacity
and
steadiness
of
our
intellectual
vision
it
is
argued
by
hume
against
the
actual
occurrence
of
the
jewish
and
christian
miracles
that
whereas
it
is
experience
only
which
gives
authority
to
human
testimony
and
it
is
the
same
experience
which
assures
us
of
the
laws
of
nature
therefore
when
these
two
kinds
of
experience
are
contrary
to
each
other
we
are
bound
to
subtract
the
one
from
the
other
and
in
consequence
since
we
have
no
experience
of
a
violation
of
natural
laws
and
much
experience
of
the
violation
of
truth
we
may
establish
it
as
a
maxim
that
no
human
testimony
can
have
such
force
as
to
prove
a
miracle
and
make
it
a
just
foundation
for
any
such
system
of
i
will
accept
the
general
proposition
but
i
resist
its
application
doubtless
it
is
abstractedly
more
likely
that
men
should
lie
than
that
the
order
of
nature
should
be
infringed
but
what
is
abstract
reasoning
to
a
question
of
concrete
fact
to
arrive
at
the
fact
of
any
matter
we
must
eschew
generalities
and
take
things
as
they
stand
with
all
their
circumstances
of
course
the
acts
of
men
are
not
so
trustworthy
as
the
order
of
nature
and
the
pretence
of
miracles
is
in
fact
more
common
than
the
occurrence
but
the
question
is
not
about
miracles
in
general
or
men
in
general
but
definitely
whether
these
particular
miracles
ascribed
to
the
particular
peter
james
and
john
are
more
likely
to
have
been
or
not
whether
they
are
unlikely
supposing
that
there
is
a
power
external
to
the
world
who
can
bring
them
about
supposing
they
are
the
only
means
by
which
he
can
reveal
himself
to
those
who
need
a
revelation
supposing
he
is
likely
to
reveal
himself
that
he
has
a
great
end
in
doing
so
that
the
professed
miracles
in
question
are
like
his
natural
works
and
such
as
he
is
likely
to
work
in
case
he
wrought
miracles
that
great
effects
otherwise
unaccountable
in
the
event
followed
upon
the
acts
said
to
be
miraculous
that
they
were
from
the
first
accepted
as
true
by
large
numbers
of
men
against
their
natural
interests
that
the
reception
of
them
as
true
has
left
its
mark
upon
the
world
as
no
other
event
ever
did
that
viewed
in
their
effects
they
is
the
belief
of
them
to
raise
human
nature
to
a
high
moral
standard
otherwise
unattainable
these
and
the
like
considerations
are
parts
of
a
great
complex
argument
which
so
far
can
be
put
into
propositions
but
which
even
between
and
around
and
behind
these
still
is
implicit
and
secret
and
can
not
by
any
ingenuity
be
imprisoned
in
a
formula
and
packed
into
a
these
various
conditions
may
be
decided
in
the
affirmative
or
in
the
negative
that
is
a
further
point
here
i
only
insist
upon
the
nature
of
the
argument
if
it
is
to
be
philosophical
it
must
be
no
smart
antithesis
which
may
look
well
on
paper
but
the
living
action
of
the
mind
on
a
great
problem
of
fact
and
we
must
summon
to
our
aid
all
our
powers
and
resources
if
we
would
encounter
it
worthily
and
not
as
if
it
were
a
literary
essay
consider
the
establishment
of
the
christian
religion
says
pascal
in
his
here
is
a
religion
contrary
to
our
nature
which
establishes
itself
in
men
s
minds
with
so
much
mildness
as
to
use
no
external
force
with
so
much
energy
that
no
tortures
could
silence
its
martyrs
and
confessors
and
consider
the
holiness
devotion
humility
of
its
true
disciples
its
sacred
books
their
superhuman
grandeur
their
admirable
simplicity
consider
the
character
of
its
founder
his
associates
and
disciples
unlettered
men
yet
possessed
of
wisdom
sufficient
to
confound
the
ablest
philosopher
the
astonishing
succession
of
prophets
who
heralded
him
the
state
at
this
day
of
the
jewish
people
who
rejected
him
and
his
religion
its
perpetuity
and
its
holiness
the
light
which
its
doctrines
shed
upon
the
contrarieties
of
our
nature
considering
these
things
let
any
man
judge
if
it
be
possible
to
doubt
about
its
being
the
only
true
one
this
is
an
argument
parallel
in
its
character
to
that
by
which
we
ascribe
the
classics
to
the
augustan
age
we
urge
that
though
we
can
not
draw
the
line
definitely
between
what
the
monks
could
do
in
literature
and
what
they
could
not
anyhow
virgil
s
æneid
and
the
odes
of
horace
are
far
beyond
the
highest
capacity
of
the
medieval
mind
which
however
great
was
different
in
the
character
of
its
endowments
and
in
like
manner
we
maintain
that
granting
that
we
can
not
decide
how
far
the
human
mind
can
advance
by
its
own
unaided
powers
in
religious
ideas
and
sentiments
and
in
religious
practice
still
the
facts
of
christianity
as
they
stand
are
beyond
what
is
possible
to
man
and
betoken
the
presence
of
a
higher
intelligence
purpose
and
might
many
have
been
converted
and
sustained
in
their
faith
by
this
argument
which
admits
of
being
powerfully
stated
but
still
such
statement
is
after
all
only
intended
to
be
a
vehicle
of
thought
and
to
open
the
mind
to
the
apprehension
of
the
facts
of
the
case
and
to
trace
them
and
their
implications
in
outline
not
to
convince
by
the
logic
of
its
mere
wording
do
we
not
think
and
muse
as
we
read
it
try
to
master
it
as
we
proceed
put
down
the
book
in
which
we
find
it
fill
out
its
details
from
our
own
resources
and
then
resume
the
study
of
it
and
when
we
have
to
give
an
account
of
it
to
others
should
we
make
use
of
its
language
or
even
of
its
thoughts
and
not
rather
of
its
drift
and
spirit
has
it
never
struck
us
what
different
lights
different
minds
throw
upon
the
same
theory
and
argument
nay
how
they
seem
to
be
differing
in
detail
when
they
are
professing
and
in
reality
showing
a
concurrence
in
it
have
we
never
found
that
when
a
friend
takes
up
the
defence
of
what
we
have
written
or
said
that
at
first
we
are
unable
to
recognize
in
his
statement
of
it
what
we
meant
it
to
convey
it
will
be
our
wisdom
to
avail
ourselves
of
language
as
far
as
it
will
go
but
to
aim
mainly
by
means
of
it
to
stimulate
in
those
to
whom
we
address
ourselves
a
mode
of
thinking
and
trains
of
thought
similar
to
our
own
leading
them
on
by
their
own
independent
action
not
by
any
syllogistic
compulsion
hence
it
is
that
an
intellectual
school
will
always
have
something
of
an
esoteric
character
for
it
is
an
assemblage
of
minds
that
think
their
bond
is
unity
of
thought
and
their
words
become
a
sort
of
not
expressing
thought
but
symbolizing
it
recurring
to
pascal
s
argument
i
observe
that
its
force
depending
upon
the
assumption
that
the
facts
of
christianity
are
beyond
human
nature
therefore
according
as
the
powers
of
nature
are
placed
at
a
high
or
low
standard
that
force
will
be
greater
or
less
and
that
standard
will
vary
according
to
the
respective
dispositions
opinions
and
experiences
of
those
to
whom
the
argument
is
addressed
thus
its
value
is
a
personal
question
not
as
if
there
were
not
an
objective
truth
and
christianity
as
a
whole
not
supernatural
but
that
when
we
come
to
consider
where
it
is
that
the
supernatural
presence
is
found
there
may
be
fair
differences
of
opinion
both
as
to
the
fact
and
the
proof
of
what
is
supernatural
there
is
a
multitude
of
facts
which
taken
separately
may
perhaps
be
natural
but
found
together
must
come
from
a
source
above
nature
and
what
these
are
and
how
many
are
necessary
will
be
variously
determined
and
while
every
inquirer
has
a
right
to
determine
the
question
according
to
the
best
exercise
of
his
judgment
still
whether
he
so
determine
it
for
himself
or
trust
in
part
or
altogether
to
the
judgment
of
those
who
have
the
best
claim
to
judge
in
either
case
he
is
guided
by
the
implicit
processes
of
the
reasoning
faculty
not
by
any
manufacture
of
arguments
forcing
their
way
to
an
irrefragable
conclusion
pascal
writes
in
another
place
he
who
doubts
but
seeks
not
to
have
his
doubts
removed
is
at
once
the
most
criminal
and
the
most
unhappy
of
mortals
if
together
with
this
he
is
tranquil
and
if
he
be
vain
of
his
tranquillity
or
makes
his
state
a
topic
of
mirth
and
i
have
not
words
to
describe
so
insane
a
creature
truly
it
is
to
the
honour
of
religion
to
have
for
its
adversaries
men
so
bereft
of
reason
their
opposition
far
from
being
formidable
bears
testimony
to
its
most
distinguishing
truths
for
the
great
object
of
the
christian
religion
is
to
establish
the
corruption
of
our
nature

the
redemption
by
jesus
christ

he
says
of
montaigne
he
involves
everything
in
such
universal
unmingled
scepticism
as
to
doubt
of
his
very
doubts

pure
pyrrhonist

here
are
two
celebrated
writers
in
direct
opposition
to

in
their
fundamental
view
of
truth
and
duty
shall
we
say
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
truth
and
error
but
that
anything
is
truth
to
a
man
which
he
troweth
and
not
rather
as
the
solution
of
a
great
mystery
that
truth
there
is
and
attainable
it
is
but
that
its
rays
stream
in
upon
us
through
the
medium
of
our
moral
as
well
as
our
intellectual
being
and
that
in
consequence
that
perception
of
its
first
principles
which
is
natural
to
us
is
enfeebled
obstructed
perverted
by
allurements
of

supremacy

aspirations
after

that
at
length
two
characters

into
shape

two
standards
and
systems
of
thought
logical
when

contradictory
of

not
antagonistic

thus
to

and

into

us
let
us
take
a
case
in
contrast
i

poor
dying
in

if

should
be
the
end
of

and
if

my

and
life
away

to
sicken
in
this
dree
place
with
those
in

ears
for
ever
until
i
could
scream
out
for
them
to
stop
and
let
me
have
a
little
piece
of
quiet
and
with
the
fluff
filling
my
lungs
until
i
thirst
to
death
for
one
long
deep
breath
of
the
clear
air
and
my
mother
gone
and
i
never
able
to
tell
her
again
how
i
loved
her

all
my
troubles
think
if

is
the
end
and
that
there
is
no
god
to
wipe
away
all
tears
from
all
eyes

here
is
an
argument
for
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
to
its
force
be
it
great
or
small
will
it
make
a
figure
in
a
logical
disputation
carried
on
can
any
scientific
common
measure
compel
the
intellects
of
dives
and
lazarus
to
take
the
same
estimate
of
it
is
there
any
test
of
the
validity
of
it
better
than
the
of
private
judgment
that
is
the
judgment
of
those
who
have
a
right
to
judge
and
next
the
agreement
of
many
private
judgments
in
one
and
the
same
view
of
it
in
order
to
prove
plainly
and
intelligibly
says
samuel
clarke
that
god
is
a
being
which
must
of
necessity
be
endued
with
perfect
knowledge
tis
to
be
observed
that
knowledge
is
a
perfection
without
which
the
foregoing
attributes
are
no
perfections
at
all
and
without
which
those
which
follow
can
have
no
foundation
where
there
is
no
knowledge
eternity
and
immensity
are
as
nothing
and
justice
goodness
mercy
and
wisdom
can
have
no
place
the
idea
of
eternity
and
omnipresence
devoid
of
knowledge
is
as
the
notion
of
darkness
compared
with
that
of
light
tis
as
a
notion
of
the
world
without
the
sun
to
illuminate
it
tis
as
the
notion
of
inanimate
matter
which
is
the
atheist
s
supreme
cause
compared
with
that
of
light
and
spirit
and
as
for
the
following
attributes
of
justice
goodness
mercy
and
wisdom
tis
evident
that
without
knowledge
there
could
not
possibly
be
any
such
things
as
these
at
all
the
argument
here
used
in
behalf
of
the
divine
attribute
of
knowledge
comes
under
the
general
proposition
that
the
attributes
imply
each
other
for
the
denial
of
one
is
the
denial
of
the
rest
to
some
minds
this
thesis
is
others
are
utterly
insensible
to
its
force
will
it
bear
bringing
out
into
words
throughout
the
whole
series
of
its
argumentative
links
for
if
it
does
then
either
those
who
maintain
it
or
those
who
reject
it
the
one
or
the
other
will
be
compelled
by
logical
necessity
to
confess
that
they
are
in
error
god
is
wise
if
he
is
eternal
he
is
good
if
he
is
wise
he
is
just
if
he
is
what
skill
can
so
arrange
these
propositions
so
add
to
them
so
combine
them
that
they
may
be
able
by
the
force
of
their
to
follow
one
from
the
other
and
become
one
and
the
same
by
an
inevitable
correlation
that
is
not
the
method
by
which
the
argument
becomes
a
demonstration
such
a
method
used
by
a
theist
in
controversy
against
men
who
are
unprepared
personally
for
the
question
will
but
issue
in
his
retreat
along
a
series
of
major
propositions
farther
and
farther
back
till
he
and
they
find
themselves
in
a
land
of
shadows
where
the
light
is
as
to
feel
the
true
force
of
an
argument
like
this
we
must
not
confine
ourselves
to
abstractions
and
merely
compare
notion
with
notion
but
we
must
contemplate
the
god
of
our
conscience
as
a
living
being
as
one
object
and
reality
the
aspect
of
this
or
that
attribute
we
must
patiently
rest
in
the
thought
of
the
eternal
omnipresent
and
rather
than
of
eternity
omnipresence
and
omniscience
and
we
must
not
hurry
on
and
force
a
series
of
deductions
which
if
they
are
to
be
realized
must
distil
like
dew
into
our
minds
and
form
themselves
spontaneously
there
by
a
calm
contemplation
and
gradual
understanding
of
their
premisses
ordinarily
speaking
such
deductions
do
not
flow
forth
except
according
as
the
image
presented
to
us
through
conscience
on
which
they
depend
is
cherished
within
us
with
the
sentiments
which
supposing
it
be
as
we
know
it
is
the
truth
it
necessarily
claims
of
us
and
is
seen
reflected
by
the
habit
of
our
intellect
in
the
appointments
and
the
events
of
the
external
world
and
in
their
manifestation
to
our
inward
sense
they
are
analogous
to
the
knowledge
which
we
at
length
attain
of
the
details
of
a
landscape
after
we
have
selected
the
right
and
have
learned
to
accommodate
the
pupil
of
our
eye
to
the
varying
focus
necessary
for
seeing
them
have
accustomed
it
to
the
glare
of
light
have
mentally
grouped
or
discriminated
lines
and
shadows
and
given
them
their
due
meaning
and
have
mastered
the
perspective
of
the
whole
or
they
may
be
compared
to
a
landscape
as
drawn
by
the
pencil
unless
the
illustration
seem
forced
in
which
by
the
skill
of
the
artist
amid
the
bold
outlines
of
trees
and
rocks
when
the
eye
has
learned
to
take
in
their
reverse
aspects
the
forms
or
faces
of
historical
personages
are
discernible
which
we
catch
and
lose
again
and
then
recover
and
which
some
who
look
on
with
us
are
never
able
to
catch
at
all
analogous
to
such
an
exercise
of
sight
must
be
our
mode
of
dealing
with
the
verbal
expositions
of
an
argument
such
as
clarke
s
his
words
speak
to
those
who
understand
the
speech
to
the
mere
barren
intellect
they
are
but
the
pale
ghosts
of
notions
but
the
trained
imagination
sees
in
them
the
representations
of
things
he
who
has
once
detected
in
his
conscience
the
outline
of
a
lawgiver
and
judge
needs
no
definition
of
him
whom
he
dimly
but
surely
contemplates
there
and
he
rejects
the
mechanism
of
logic
which
can
not
contain
in
its
grasp
matters
so
real
and
so
recondite
such
a
one
according
to
the
strength
and
perspicacity
of
his
mind
the
force
of
his
presentiments
and
his
power
of
sustained
attention
is
able
to
pronounce
about
the
great
sight
which
encompasses
him
as
about
some
visible
object
and
in
his
investigation
of
the
divine
attributes
is
not
inferring
abstraction
from
abstraction
but
noting
down
the
aspects
and
phases
of
that
one
thing
on
which
he
ever
is
gazing
nor
is
it
possible
to
limit
the
depth
of
meaning
which
at
length
he
will
attach
to
words
which
to
the
many
are
but
definitions
and
ideas
here
then
again
as
in
the
other
instances
it
seems
clear
that
methodical
processes
of
inference
useful
as
they
are
as
far
as
they
go
are
only
instruments
of
the
mind
and
need
in
order
to
their
due
exercise
that
real
ratiocination
and
present
imagination
which
gives
them
a
sense
beyond
their
letter
and
which
while
acting
through
them
reaches
to
conclusions
beyond
and
above
them
such
a
living
is
a
personal
gift
and
not
a
mere
method
or
calculus
that
there
are
cases
in
which
evidence
not
sufficient
for
a
scientific
proof
is
nevertheless
sufficient
for
assent
and
certitude
is
the
doctrine
of
locke
as
of
most
men
he
tells
us
that
belief
grounded
on
sufficient
probabilities
rises
to
assurance
and
as
to
the
question
of
sufficiency
that
where
propositions
border
near
on
certainty
then
we
assent
to
them
as
firmly
as
if
they
were
infallibly
the
only
question
is
what
these
propositions
are
this
he
does
not
tell
us
but
he
seems
to
think
that
they
are
few
in
number
and
will
be
without
any
trouble
recognized
at
once
by
whereas
unless
i
am
mistaken
they
are
to
be
found
throughout
the
range
of
concrete
matter
and
that
judgment
which
is
the
warrant
for
our
certitude
about
them
is
not
mere
but
the
true
healthy
action
of
our
ratiocinative
powers
an
action
more
subtle
and
more
comprehensive
than
the
mere
appreciation
of
a
syllogistic
argument
it
is
often
called
the
judicium
prudentis
viri
a
standard
of
certitude
which
holds
good
in
all
concrete
matter
not
only
in
those
cases
of
practice
and
duty
in
which
we
are
more
familiar
with
it
but
in
questions
of
truth
and
falsehood
generally
or
in
what
are
called
speculative
questions
and
that
not
indeed
to
the
exclusion
but
as
the
supplement
of
logic
thus
a
proof
except
in
abstract
demonstration
has
always
in
it
more
or
less
an
element
of
the
personal
because
prudence
is
not
a
constituent
part
of
our
nature
but
a
personal
endowment
and
the
language
in
common
use
when
concrete
conclusions
are
in
question
implies
the
presence
of
this
personal
element
in
the
proof
of
them
we
are
considered
to
feel
rather
than
to
see
its
cogency
and
we
decide
not
that
the
conclusion
must
be
but
that
it
can
not
be
otherwise
we
say
that
we
do
not
see
our
way
to
doubt
it
that
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
that
we
are
bound
to
believe
it
that
we
should
be
idiots
if
we
did
not
believe
we
never
should
say
in
abstract
science
that
we
could
not
escape
the
conclusion
that
was
a
mean
proportional
between
and
or
that
a
man
had
no
right
to
say
that
a
tangent
to
a
circle
at
the
extremity
of
the
radius
makes
an
acute
angle
with
it
yet
though
our
certitude
of
the
fact
is
quite
as
clear
we
should
not
think
it
unnatural
to
say
that
the
insularity
of
great
britain
is
as
good
as
demonstrated
or
that
none
but
a
fool
expects
never
to
die
phrases
indeed
such
as
these
are
sometimes
used
to
express
a
shade
of
doubt
but
it
is
enough
for
my
purpose
if
they
are
also
used
when
doubt
is
altogether
absent
what
then
they
signify
is
what
i
have
so
much
insisted
on
that
we
have
arrived
at
these
opere
by
a
scientific
necessity
independent
of
ourselves
by
the
action
of
our
own
minds
by
our
own
individual
perception
of
the
truth
in
question
under
a
sense
of
duty
to
those
conclusions
and
with
an
intellectual
conscientiousness
this
certitude
and
this
evidence
are
often
called
moral
a
word
which
i
avoid
as
having
a
very
vague
meaning
but
using
it
here
for
once
i
observe
that
moral
evidence
and
moral
certitude
are
all
that
we
can
attain
not
only
in
the
case
of
ethical
and
spiritual
subjects
such
as
religion
but
of
terrestrial
and
cosmical
questions
also
so
far
physical
astronomy
and
revelation
stand
on
the
same
footing
vince
in
his
treatise
on
astronomy
does
but
use
the
language
of
philosophical
sobriety
when
after
speaking
of
the
proofs
of
the
earth
s
rotatory
motion
he
says
when
these
reasons
all
upon
different
principles
are
considered
they
amount
to
a
proof
of
the
earth
s
rotation
about
its
axis
which
is
as
satisfactory
to
the
mind
as
the
most
direct
demonstration
could
be
or
as
he
had
said
just
before
the
mind
rests
equally
satisfied
as
if
the
matter
was
strictly
proved
that
is
first
there
is
no
demonstration
that
the
earth
rotates
next
there
is
a
cluster
of
reasons
on
principles
that
is
independent
probabilities
in
cumulation
thirdly
these
to
a
proof
and
the
mind
feels
the
matter
was
strictly
proved
that
is
there
is
the
equivalent
of
proof
lastly
the
mind
rests
that
is
it
is
certain
on
the
point
and
though
evidence
of
the
fact
is
now
obtained
which
was
not
known
fifty
years
ago
that
evidence
on
the
whole
has
not
changed
its
character
compare
with
this
avowal
the
language
of
butler
when
discussing
the
proof
of
revelation
probable
proofs
he
says
by
being
added
not
only
increase
the
evidence
but
multiply
it
the
truth
of
our
religion
like
the
truth
of
common
matters
is
to
be
judged
by
the
whole
evidence
taken
together
in
like
manner
as
if
in
any
common
case
numerous
events
acknowledged
were
to
be
alleged
in
proof
of
any
other
event
disputed
the
truth
of
the
disputed
event
would
be
proved
not
only
if
any
one
of
the
acknowledged
ones
did
of
itself
clearly
imply
it
but
though
no
one
of
them
singly
did
so
if
the
whole
of
the
acknowledged
events
taken
together
could
not
in
reason
be
supposed
to
have
happened
unless
the
disputed
one
were
true
here
as
in
astronomy
is
the
same
absence
of
demonstration
of
the
thesis
the
same
cumulating
and
converging
indications
of
it
the
same
indirectness
in
the
proof
as
being
the
same
recognition
nevertheless
that
the
conclusion
is
not
only
probable
but
true
one
other
characteristic
of
the
argumentative
process
is
given
which
is
unnecessary
in
a
so
clear
and
simple
as
astronomical
science
viz
the
moral
state
of
the
parties
inquiring
or
disputing
they
must
be
as
much
in
earnest
about
religion
as
about
their
temporal
affairs
capable
of
being
convinced
on
real
evidence
that
there
is
a
god
who
governs
the
world
and
feel
themselves
to
be
of
a
moral
nature
and
accountable
creatures
this
being
the
state
of
the
case
the
question
arises
whether
granting
that
the
personality
so
to
speak
of
the
parties
reasoning
is
an
important
element
in
proving
propositions
in
concrete
matter
any
account
can
be
given
of
the
ratiocinative
method
in
such
proofs
over
and
above
that
analysis
into
syllogism
which
is
possible
in
each
of
its
steps
in
detail
i
think
there
can
though
i
fear
lest
to
some
minds
it
may
appear
or
fanciful
however
i
will
hazard
this
imputation
i
consider
then
that
the
principle
of
concrete
reasoning
is
parallel
to
the
method
of
proof
which
is
the
foundation
of
modern
mathematical
science
as
contained
in
the
celebrated
lemma
with
which
newton
opens
his
we
know
that
a
regular
polygon
inscribed
in
a
circle
its
sides
being
continually
diminished
tends
to
become
that
circle
as
its
limit
but
it
vanishes
before
it
has
coincided
with
the
circle
so
that
its
tendency
to
be
the
circle
though
ever
nearer
fulfilment
never
in
fact
gets
beyond
a
tendency
in
like
manner
the
conclusion
in
a
real
or
concrete
question
is
foreseen
and
predicted
rather
than
actually
attained
foreseen
in
the
number
and
direction
of
accumulated
premisses
which
all
converge
to
it
and
approach
it
as
the
result
of
their
combination
more
nearly
than
any
assignable
difference
yet
do
not
touch
it
logically
though
only
not
touching
it
on
account
of
the
nature
of
its
and
the
delicate
and
implicit
character
of
at
least
part
of
the
reasonings
on
which
it
depends
it
is
by
the
strength
variety
or
multiplicity
of
premisses
which
are
only
probable
not
by
invincible
syllogisms
objections
overcome
by
adverse
theories
neutralized
by
difficulties
gradually
clearing
up
by
exceptions
proving
the
rule
by
correlations
found
with
received
truths
by
suspense
and
delay
in
the
process
issuing
in
triumphant
reactions
all
these
ways
and
many
others
the
practised
and
experienced
mind
is
able
to
make
a
sure
divination
that
a
conclusion
is
inevitable
of
which
his
lines
of
reasoning
do
not
actually
put
him
in
possession
this
is
what
is
meant
by
a
proposition
being
as
good
as
proved
a
conclusion
as
undeniable
as
if
it
were
proved
and
by
the
reasons
for
it
amounting
to
a
proof
for
a
proof
is
the
limit
of
converging
probabilities
it
may
be
added
that
whereas
the
logical
form
of
this
argument
is
as
i
have
already
observed
indirect
viz
that
the
conclusion
can
not
be
otherwise
and
butler
says
that
an
event
is
proved
if
its
antecedents
could
not
in
reason
be
supposed
to
have
happened
it
were
true
and
tell
us
that
the
principle
of
circumstantial
evidence
is
the
ad
so
newton
is
forced
to
the
same
mode
of
proof
for
the
establishment
of
his
lemma
about
prime
and
ultimate
ratios
if
you
deny
that
they
become
ultimately
equal
he
says
let
them
be
ultimately
unequal
and
the
consequence
follows
which
is
against
the
such
being
the
character
of
the
mental
process
in
concrete
reasoning
i
should
wish
to
adduce
some
good
instances
of
it
in
illustration
instances
in
which
the
person
reasoning
confesses
that
he
is
reasoning
on
this
very
process
as
i
have
been
stating
it
but
these
are
difficult
to
find
from
the
very
circumstance
that
the
process
from
first
to
last
is
carried
on
as
much
without
words
as
with
them
however
i
will
set
down
three
such
first
an
instance
in
physics
wood
treating
of
the
laws
of
motion
thus
describes
the
line
of
reasoning
by
which
the
mind
is
certified
of
them
they
are
not
indeed
nor
do
they
admit
of
accurate
proof
by
experiment
on
account
of
the
effects
of
friction
and
the
air
s
resistance
which
can
not
entirely
be
removed
they
are
however
constantly
and
invariably
suggested
to
our
senses
and
they
agree
with
experiment
as
far
as
experiment
can
go
and
the
more
accurately
the
experiments
are
made
and
the
greater
care
we
take
to
remove
all
those
impediments
which
tend
to
render
the
conclusions
erroneous
the
more
nearly
do
the
experiments
coincide
with
these
laws
their
truth
is
also
established
upon
a
different
ground
from
these
general
principles
innumerable
particular
conclusions
have
been
deducted
sometimes
the
deductions
are
simple
and
immediate
sometimes
they
are
made
by
tedious
and
intricate
operations
yet
they
are
all
without
exception
consistent
with
each
other
and
with
experiment
it
follows
thereby
that
the
principles
upon
which
the
calculations
are
founded
are
true
the
reasoning
of
this
passage
in
which
the
uniformity
of
the
laws
of
nature
is
assumed
seems
to
me
a
good
illustration
of
what
must
be
considered
the
principle
or
form
of
an
induction
the
conclusion
which
is
its
scope
is
by
its
own
confession
not
proved
but
it
ought
to
be
proved
or
is
as
good
as
proved
and
a
man
would
be
irrational
who
did
not
take
it
to
be
virtually
proved
first
because
the
imperfections
in
the
proof
arise
out
of
its
and
the
nature
of
the
case
so
that
it
proved
and
next
because
in
the
same
degree
in
which
these
faults
in
the
are
overcome
here
or
there
are
the
involved
imperfections
here
or
there
of
the
proof
remedied
and
further
because
when
the
conclusion
is
assumed
as
an
hypothesis
it
throws
light
upon
a
multitude
of
collateral
facts
accounting
for
them
and
uniting
them
together
in
one
whole
consistency
is
not
always
the
guarantee
of
truth
but
there
may
be
a
consistency
in
a
theory
so
variously
tried
and
exemplified
as
to
lead
to
belief
in
it
as
reasonably
as
a
witness
in
a
court
of
law
may
after
a
severe
satisfy
and
assure
judge
jury
and
the
whole
court
of
his
simple
veracity
and
from
the
courts
of
law
shall
my
second
illustration
be
taken
a
learned
writer
says
in
criminal
prosecutions
the
circumstantial
evidence
should
be
such
as
to
produce
nearly
the
same
degree
of
certainty
as
that
which
arises
from
direct
testimony
and
to
exclude
a
rational
probability
of
innocence
by
degrees
of
certainty
he
seems
to
mean
together
with
many
other
writers
degrees
of
proof
or
approximations
towards
proof
and
not
certitude
as
a
state
of
mind
and
he
says
that
no
one
should
be
pronounced
guilty
on
evidence
which
is
not
equivalent
in
weight
to
direct
testimony
so
far
is
clear
but
what
is
meant
by
the
expression
probability
for
there
can
be
no
probability
but
what
is
rational
i
consider
that
the
exclusion
of
a
rational
probability
means
the
exclusion
of
any
argument
in
the
man
s
favour
which
has
a
rational
claim
to
be
called
probable
or
rather
the
rational
exclusion
of
any
supposition
that
he
is
innocent
and
rational
is
used
in
contradistinction
to
argumentative
and
means
resting
on
implicit
reasons
such
as
we
feel
indeed
but
which
for
some
cause
or
other
because
they
are
too
subtle
or
too
circuitous
we
can
not
put
into
words
so
as
to
satisfy
logic
if
this
is
a
correct
account
of
his
meaning
he
says
that
the
evidence
against
a
criminal
in
order
to
be
decisive
of
his
guilt
to
the
satisfaction
of
our
conscience
must
bear
with
it
along
with
the
palpable
arguments
for
that
guilt
such
a
reasonableness
or
body
of
implicit
reasons
for
it
in
addition
as
may
exclude
any
probability
really
such
that
he
is
not
guilty
is
it
must
be
an
evidence
free
from
anything
obscure
suspicious
unnatural
or
defective
such
as
in
the
judgment
of
a
prudent
man
to
hinder
that
summation
or
coalescence
of
the
evidence
into
a
proof
which
i
have
compared
to
the
running
into
a
limit
in
the
case
of
mathematical
ratios
just
as
an
algebraical
series
may
be
of
a
nature
never
to
terminate
or
admit
of
valuation
as
being
the
equivalent
of
an
irrational
quantity
or
surd
so
there
may
be
some
grave
imperfections
in
a
body
of
reasons
explicit
or
implicit
which
is
directed
to
a
proof
sufficient
to
interfere
with
its
successful
issue
or
resolution
and
to
balk
us
with
an
irrational
that
is
an
indeterminate
conclusion
so
much
as
to
the
principle
of
conclusions
made
upon
evidence
in
criminal
cases
now
let
us
turn
to
an
instance
of
its
application
in
a
particular
instance
some
years
ago
there
was
a
murder
committed
which
unusually
agitated
the
popular
mind
and
the
evidence
against
the
culprit
was
necessarily
circumstantial
at
the
trial
the
judge
in
addressing
the
jury
instructed
them
on
the
kind
of
evidence
necessary
for
a
verdict
of
of
course
he
could
not
mean
to
say
that
they
must
convict
a
man
of
whose
guilt
they
were
not
certain
especially
in
a
case
in
which
two
foreign
countries
germany
and
the
american
states
were
attentively
looking
on
if
the
jury
had
any
doubt
that
is
reasonable
doubt
about
the
man
s
guilt
of
course
they
would
give
him
the
benefit
of
that
doubt
nor
could
the
certitude
which
would
be
necessary
for
an
adverse
verdict
be
merely
that
which
is
sometimes
called
a
practical
certitude
that
is
a
certitude
indeed
but
a
certitude
that
it
was
a
duty
expedient
safe
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
course
the
judge
spoke
of
what
is
called
a
speculative
certitude
that
is
a
certitude
of
the
fact
that
the
man
was
guilty
the
only
question
being
what
evidence
was
sufficient
for
the
proof
for
the
certitude
of
that
fact
this
is
what
the
judge
meant
and
these
are
among
the
remarks
which
with
this
drift
he
made
upon
the
occasion
after
observing
that
by
circumstantial
evidence
he
meant
a
case
in
which
the
facts
do
not
directly
prove
the
actual
crime
but
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
prisoner
committed
that
crime
he
went
on
to
disclaim
the
suggestion
made
by
counsel
in
the
case
that
the
jury
could
not
pronounce
a
verdict
of
unless
they
were
as
much
satisfied
that
the
prisoner
did
the
deed
as
if
they
had
seen
him
commit
it
that
is
not
the
certainty
he
said
which
is
required
of
you
to
discharge
your
duty
to
the
prisoner
whose
safety
is
in
your
then
he
stated
what
was
the
degree
of
certainty
that
is
of
certainty
or
perfection
of
proof
which
was
necessary
to
the
question
involving
as
it
did
the
life
of
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
was
such
as
that
with
which
he
said
you
decide
upon
and
conclude
your
own
most
important
transactions
in
life
take
the
facts
which
are
proved
before
you
separate
those
you
believe
from
those
which
you
do
not
believe
and
all
the
conclusions
that
naturally
and
almost
necessarily
result
from
those
facts
you
may
confide
in
as
much
as
in
the
facts
themselves
the
case
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
is
the
of
the
murder
told
by
the
witnesses
who
the
circumstances
one
after
according
to
their
occurrence
together
with
the
discovery
of
some
apparent
connexion
between
the
property
that
was
lost
and
the
possession
of
it
by
the
now
here
i
observe
that
whereas
the
conclusion
which
is
contemplated
by
the
judge
is
what
may
be
pronounced
on
the
whole
and
considering
all
things
and
judging
reasonably
a
proved
or
certain
conclusion
that
is
a
conclusion
of
the
truth
of
the
allegation
against
the
prisoner
or
of
the
fact
of
his
guilt
on
the
other
hand
the
constituting
this
reasonable
rational
proof
and
this
satisfactory
certitude
needed
not
according
to
him
to
be
stronger
than
those
on
which
we
prudently
act
on
matters
of
important
interest
to
ourselves
that
is
probable
reasons
viewed
in
their
convergence
and
combination
and
whereas
the
certitude
is
viewed
by
the
judge
as
following
on
converging
probabilities
which
constitute
a
real
though
only
a
reasonable
not
an
argumentative
proof
so
it
will
be
observed
in
this
particular
instance
that
in
illustration
of
the
general
doctrine
which
i
have
laid
down
the
process
is
one
of
line
upon
line
and
letter
upon
letter
of
various
details
accumulating
and
of
deductions
fitting
in
to
each
other
for
in
the
judge
s
words
there
was
a
that
not
told
right
out
and
by
one
witness
but
taken
up
and
handed
on
from
witness
to
unfolded
and
tending
to
a
proof
which
of
course
might
have
been
ten
times
stronger
than
it
was
but
was
still
a
proof
for
all
that
and
sufficient
for
its
conclusion
as
we
see
that
two
straight
lines
are
meeting
and
are
certain
they
will
meet
at
a
given
distance
though
we
do
not
actually
see
the
junction
the
third
instance
i
will
take
is
one
of
a
literary
character
the
divination
of
the
authorship
of
a
certain
anonymous
publication
as
suggested
mainly
by
internal
evidence
as
i
find
it
in
a
critique
written
some
twenty
years
ago
in
the
extract
which
i
make
from
it
we
may
observe
the
same
steady
march
of
a
proof
towards
a
conclusion
which
is
as
it
were
out
of
sight
reckoning
or
a
reasonable
judgment
that
the
conclusion
really
is
proved
and
a
personal
certitude
upon
that
judgment
joined
with
a
confession
that
a
logical
argument
could
not
well
be
made
out
for
it
and
that
the
various
details
in
which
the
proof
consisted
were
in
no
small
measure
implicit
and
impalpable
rumour
speaks
uniformly
and
clearly
enough
in
attributing
it
to
the
pen
of
a
particular
individual
nor
although
a
cursory
reader
might
well
skim
the
book
without
finding
in
it
anything
to
suggest
will
it
appear
improbable
to
the
more
attentive
student
of
its
internal
evidence
and
the
improbability
will
decrease
more
and
more
in
proportion
as
the
is
of
judging
and
appreciating
the
and
at
first
invisible
which
limit
to
who
understand
the
individuals
who
can
have
written
it
to
a
very
small
number
indeed
the
utmost
scepticism
as
to
its
authorship
we
do
not
feel
can
not
remove
it
farther
from
him
than
to
that
of
some
one
among
his
most
intimate
friends
so
that
leaving
others
to
discuss
antecedent
probabilities
here
is
a
writer
who
professes
to
have
no
doubt
at
all
about
the
authorship
of
a
book
at
the
same
time
he
can
not
prove
by
mere
argumentation
set
down
in
words
the
reasons
of
his
conviction
are
too
delicate
too
intricate
nay
they
are
in
part
invisible
invisible
except
to
those
who
from
circumstances
have
an
intellectual
perception
of
what
does
not
appear
to
the
many
they
are
personal
to
the
individual
this
again
is
an
instance
distinctly
set
before
us
of
the
particular
mode
in
which
the
mind
progresses
in
concrete
matter
viz
from
merely
probable
antecedents
to
the
sufficient
proof
of
a
fact
or
a
truth
and
after
the
proof
to
an
act
of
certitude
about
it
i
trust
the
foregoing
remarks
may
not
deserve
the
blame
of
a
needless
refinement
i
have
thought
it
incumbent
on
me
to
illustrate
the
intellectual
process
by
which
we
pass
from
conditional
inference
to
unconditional
assent
and
i
have
had
only
the
alternative
of
lying
under
the
imputation
of
a
paradox
or
of
a
subtlety
natural
inference
i
commenced
my
remarks
upon
inference
by
saying
that
reasoning
ordinarily
shows
as
a
simple
act
not
as
a
process
as
if
there
were
no
medium
interposed
between
antecedent
and
consequent
and
the
transition
from
one
to
the
other
were
of
the
nature
of
an
instinct
is
the
process
is
altogether
unconscious
and
implicit
it
is
necessary
then
to
take
some
notice
of
this
natural
or
material
inference
as
an
existing
phenomenon
of
mind
and
that
the
more
because
i
shall
thereby
be
illustrating
and
supporting
what
i
have
been
saying
of
the
characteristics
of
inferential
processes
as
carried
on
in
concrete
matter
and
especially
of
their
being
the
action
of
the
mind
itself
that
is
by
its
ratiocinative
or
illative
faculty
not
a
mere
operation
as
in
the
rules
of
arithmetic
i
say
then
that
our
most
natural
mode
of
reasoning
is
not
from
propositions
to
propositions
but
from
things
to
things
from
concrete
to
concrete
from
wholes
to
wholes
whether
the
consequents
at
which
we
arrive
from
the
antecedents
with
which
we
start
lead
us
to
assent
or
only
towards
assent
those
antecedents
commonly
are
not
recognized
by
us
as
subjects
for
analysis
nay
often
are
only
indirectly
recognized
as
antecedents
at
all
not
only
is
the
inference
with
its
process
ignored
but
the
antecedent
also
to
the
mind
itself
the
reasoning
is
a
simple
divination
or
prediction
as
it
literally
is
in
the
instance
of
enthusiasts
who
mistake
their
own
thoughts
for
inspirations
this
is
the
mode
in
which
we
ordinarily
reason
dealing
with
things
directly
and
as
they
stand
one
by
one
in
the
concrete
with
an
intrinsic
and
personal
power
not
a
conscious
adoption
of
an
artificial
instrument
or
expedient
and
it
is
especially
exemplified
both
in
uneducated
men
and
in
men
of
genius
those
who
know
nothing
of
intellectual
aids
and
rules
and
in
those
who
care
nothing
for
them
those
who
are
either
without
or
above
mental
discipline
as
true
poetry
is
a
spontaneous
outpouring
of
thought
and
therefore
belongs
to
rude
as
well
as
to
gifted
minds
whereas
no
one
becomes
a
poet
merely
by
the
canons
of
criticism
so
this
unscientific
reasoning
being
sometimes
a
natural
uncultivated
faculty
sometimes
approaching
to
a
gift
sometimes
an
acquired
habit
and
second
nature
has
a
higher
source
than
logical
rule
nascitur
non
when
it
is
characterized
by
precision
subtlety
promptitude
and
truth
it
is
of
course
a
gift
and
a
rarity
in
ordinary
minds
it
is
biassed
and
degraded
by
prejudice
passion
and
but
still
after
all
this
divination
comes
by
nature
and
belongs
to
all
of
us
in
a
measure
to
women
more
than
to
men
hitting
or
missing
as
the
case
may
be
but
with
a
success
on
the
whole
sufficient
to
show
that
there
is
a
method
in
it
though
it
be
implicit
a
peasant
who
is
may
be
simply
unable
to
assign
intelligible
reasons
why
he
thinks
it
will
be
fine
and
if
he
attempts
to
do
so
he
may
give
reasons
wide
of
the
mark
but
that
will
not
weaken
his
own
confidence
in
his
prediction
his
mind
does
not
proceed
step
by
step
but
he
feels
all
at
once
the
force
of
various
combined
phenomena
though
he
is
not
conscious
of
them
again
there
are
physicians
who
excel
in
the
of
complaints
though
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
they
could
defend
their
decision
in
a
particular
case
against
a
brother
physician
who
disputed
it
they
are
guided
by
natural
acuteness
and
varied
experience
they
have
their
own
idiosyncratic
modes
of
observing
generalizing
and
concluding
when
questioned
they
can
but
rest
on
their
own
authority
or
appeal
to
the
future
event
in
a
popular
novel
a
lawyer
is
introduced
who
would
know
almost
by
instinct
whether
an
accused
person
was
or
was
not
guilty
and
he
had
already
perceived
by
instinct
that
the
heroine
was
guilty
i
ve
no
doubt
she
s
a
clever
woman
he
said
and
at
once
named
an
attorney
practising
at
the
old
bailey
so
again
experts
and
detectives
when
employed
to
investigate
mysteries
in
cases
whether
of
the
civil
or
criminal
law
discern
and
follow
out
indications
which
promise
solution
with
a
sagacity
incomprehensible
to
ordinary
men
a
parallel
gift
is
the
intuitive
perception
of
character
possessed
by
certain
men
while
others
are
as
destitute
of
it
as
others
again
are
of
an
ear
for
music
what
common
measure
is
there
between
the
judgments
of
those
who
have
this
intuition
and
those
who
have
not
what
but
the
event
can
settle
any
difference
of
opinion
which
occurs
in
their
estimation
of
a
third
person
these
are
instances
of
a
natural
capacity
or
of
nature
improved
by
practice
and
habit
enabling
the
mind
to
pass
promptly
from
one
set
of
facts
to
another
not
only
i
say
without
conscious
media
but
without
conscious
antecedents
sometimes
i
say
this
illative
faculty
is
nothing
short
of
genius
such
seems
to
have
been
newton
s
perception
of
truths
mathematical
and
physical
though
proof
was
absent
at
least
that
is
the
impression
left
on
my
own
mind
by
various
stories
which
are
told
of
him
one
of
which
was
stated
in
the
public
papers
a
few
years
ago
professor
sylvester
it
was
said
has
just
discovered
the
proof
of
sir
isaac
newton
s
rule
for
ascertaining
the
imaginary
roots
of
equations
this
rule
has
been
a
among
algebraists
for
the
last
century
and
a
half
the
proof
being
wanting
authors
became
ashamed
at
length
of
advancing
a
proposition
the
evidence
for
which
rested
on
no
other
foundation
than
belief
in
newton
s
sagacity
such
is
the
gift
of
the
calculating
boys
who
now
and
then
make
their
appearance
who
seem
to
have
certain
to
conclusions
which
they
can
not
explain
to
themselves
some
are
said
to
have
been
able
to
determine
what
numbers
are
prime
i
think
up
to
seven
places
in
a
very
different
napoleon
supplies
us
with
an
instance
of
a
parallel
genius
in
reasoning
by
which
he
was
enabled
to
look
at
things
in
his
own
province
and
to
interpret
them
truly
apparently
without
any
ratiocinative
media
by
long
experience
says
alison
joined
to
great
natural
quickness
and
precision
of
eye
he
had
acquired
the
power
of
judging
with
extraordinary
accuracy
both
of
the
amount
of
the
enemy
s
force
opposed
to
him
in
the
field
and
of
the
probable
result
of
the
movements
even
the
most
complicated
going
forward
in
the
opposite
armies
he
looked
around
him
for
a
little
while
with
his
telescope
and
immediately
formed
a
clear
conception
of
the
position
forces
and
intention
of
the
whole
hostile
array
in
this
way
he
could
with
surprising
accuracy
calculate
in
a
few
minutes
according
to
what
he
could
see
of
their
formation
and
the
extent
of
the
ground
which
they
occupied
the
numerical
force
of
armies
of
or
men
and
if
their
troops
were
at
all
scattered
he
knew
at
once
how
long
it
would
require
for
them
to
concentrate
and
how
many
hours
must
elapse
before
they
could
make
their
attack
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
calling
such
clear
presentiments
by
the
name
of
instinct
and
i
think
they
may
so
be
called
if
by
instinct
be
understood
not
a
natural
sense
one
and
the
same
in
all
and
incapable
of
cultivation
but
a
perception
of
facts
without
assignable
media
of
perceiving
there
are
those
who
can
tell
at
once
what
is
conducive
or
injurious
to
their
welfare
who
are
their
friends
who
their
enemies
what
is
to
happen
to
them
and
how
they
are
to
meet
it
presence
of
mind
fathoming
of
motives
talent
for
repartee
are
instances
of
this
gift
as
to
that
divination
of
personal
danger
which
is
found
in
the
young
and
innocent
we
find
a
description
of
it
in
one
of
scott
s
romances
in
which
the
heroine
without
being
able
to
discover
what
was
wrong
either
in
the
scenes
of
unusual
luxury
with
which
she
was
surrounded
or
in
the
manner
of
her
hostess
is
said
nevertheless
to
have
felt
an
instinctive
apprehension
that
all
was
not
right
feeling
in
the
human
mind
the
author
proceeds
to
say
allied
perhaps
to
that
sense
of
danger
which
animals
exhibit
when
placed
in
the
vicinity
of
the
natural
enemies
of
their
race
and
which
makes
birds
cower
when
the
hawk
is
in
the
air
and
beasts
tremble
when
the
tiger
is
abroad
in
the
desert
a
religious
biography
lately
published
affords
us
an
instance
of
this
spontaneous
perception
of
truth
in
the
province
of
revealed
doctrine
her
firm
faith
says
the
author
of
the
preface
was
so
vivid
in
its
character
that
it
was
almost
like
an
intuition
of
the
entire
prospect
of
revealed
truth
let
an
error
against
faith
be
concealed
under
expressions
however
abstruse
and
her
sure
instinct
found
it
out
i
have
tried
this
experiment
repeatedly
she
might
not
be
able
to
separate
the
heresy
by
analysis
but
she
saw
and
felt
and
suffered
from
its
presence
and
so
of
the
great
fundamental
truths
of
religion
natural
and
revealed
and
as
regards
the
mass
of
religious
men
these
truths
doubtless
may
be
proved
and
defended
by
an
array
of
invincible
logical
arguments
but
such
is
not
commonly
the
method
in
which
those
same
logical
arguments
make
their
way
into
our
minds
the
grounds
on
which
we
hold
the
divine
origin
of
the
church
and
the
previous
truths
which
are
taught
us
by
being
of
a
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
felt
by
most
men
to
be
recondite
and
impalpable
in
proportion
to
their
depth
and
reality
as
we
can
not
see
ourselves
so
we
can
not
well
see
intellectual
motives
which
are
so
intimately
ours
and
which
spring
up
from
the
very
constitution
of
our
minds
and
while
we
refuse
to
admit
the
notion
that
religion
has
not
irrefragable
arguments
in
its
behalf
still
the
attempts
to
argue
on
the
part
of
an
individual
et
will
sometimes
only
confuse
his
apprehension
of
sacred
objects
and
subtracts
from
his
devotion
quite
as
much
as
it
adds
to
his
knowledge
this
is
found
in
the
case
of
other
perceptions
besides
that
of
faith
it
is
the
case
of
nature
against
art
of
course
if
possible
nature
and
art
should
be
combined
but
sometimes
they
are
incompatible
thus
in
the
case
of
calculating
boys
it
is
said
i
know
not
with
what
truth
that
to
teach
them
the
ordinary
rules
of
arithmetic
is
to
endanger
or
to
destroy
the
extraordinary
endowment
and
men
who
have
the
gift
of
playing
on
an
instrument
by
ear
are
sometimes
afraid
to
learn
by
rule
lest
they
should
lose
it
there
is
an
analogy
in
this
respect
between
ratiocination
and
memory
though
the
latter
may
be
exercised
without
antecedents
or
media
whereas
the
former
requires
them
in
its
very
idea
at
the
same
time
association
has
so
much
to
do
with
memory
that
we
may
not
unfairly
consider
that
memory
as
well
as
reasoning
depends
on
certain
previous
conditions
writing
as
i
have
already
observed
is
a
or
logic
of
memory
now
it
will
be
found
i
think
that
indispensable
as
is
the
use
of
letters
still
in
fact
we
weaken
our
memory
in
proportion
as
we
habituate
ourselves
to
commit
all
that
we
wish
to
remember
to
memorandums
of
course
in
proportion
as
our
memory
is
weak
or
and
thereby
treacherous
we
can
not
help
ourselves
but
in
the
case
of
men
of
strong
memory
in
any
particular
as
in
that
of
dates
all
artificial
expedients
from
the
thirty
days
has
september
to
the
more
formidable
formulas
which
are
offered
for
their
use
are
as
difficult
and
repulsive
as
the
natural
exercise
of
memory
is
healthy
and
easy
to
them
just
as
the
and
practical
reasoner
who
sees
conclusions
at
a
glance
is
uncomfortable
under
the
drill
of
a
logician
being
oppressed
and
hampered
as
david
in
saul
s
armour
by
what
is
intended
to
be
a
benefit
i
need
not
say
more
on
this
part
of
the
subject
what
is
called
reasoning
is
often
only
a
peculiar
and
personal
mode
of
abstraction
and
so
far
like
memory
may
be
said
to
exist
without
antecedents
it
is
a
power
of
looking
at
things
in
some
particular
aspect
and
of
determining
their
internal
and
external
relations
thereby
and
according
to
the
subtlety
and
versatility
of
their
gift
are
men
able
to
read
what
comes
before
them
justly
variously
and
fruitfully
hence
too
it
is
that
in
our
intercourse
with
others
in
business
and
family
matters
in
social
and
political
transactions
a
word
or
an
act
on
the
part
of
another
is
sometimes
a
sudden
revelation
light
breaks
in
upon
us
and
our
whole
judgment
of
a
course
of
events
or
of
an
undertaking
is
changed
we
determine
correctly
or
otherwise
as
it
may
be
but
in
either
case
by
a
sense
proper
to
ourselves
for
another
may
see
the
objects
which
we
are
thus
using
and
give
them
quite
a
different
interpretation
inasmuch
as
he
abstracts
another
set
of
general
notions
from
those
same
phenomena
which
present
themselves
to
us
what
i
have
been
saying
of
ratiocination
may
be
said
of
taste
and
is
confirmed
by
the
obvious
analogy
between
the
two
taste
skill
invention
in
the
fine
so
again
discretion
or
judgment
in
exerted
spontaneously
when
once
acquired
and
could
not
give
a
clear
account
of
themselves
or
of
their
mode
of
proceeding
they
do
not
go
by
rule
though
to
a
certain
point
their
exercise
may
be
analyzed
and
may
take
the
shape
of
an
art
or
method
but
these
parallels
will
come
before
us
presently
and
now
i
come
to
a
further
peculiarity
of
this
natural
and
spontaneous
ratiocination
this
faculty
as
it
is
actually
found
in
us
proceeding
from
concrete
to
concrete
belongs
to
a
definite
according
to
the
individual
in
spite
of
aristotle
i
will
not
allow
that
genuine
reasoning
is
an
instrumental
art
and
in
spite
of
johnson
i
will
assert
that
genius
as
far
as
it
is
manifested
in
ratiocination
is
not
equal
to
all
undertakings
but
has
its
own
peculiar
and
is
circumscribed
in
its
range
no
one
would
for
a
moment
expect
that
because
newton
and
napoleon
both
had
a
genius
for
ratiocination
that
in
consequence
napoleon
could
have
generalized
the
principle
of
gravitation
or
newton
have
seen
how
to
concentrate
a
hundred
thousand
men
at
austerlitz
the
ratiocinative
faculty
then
as
found
in
individuals
is
not
a
general
instrument
of
knowledge
but
has
its
province
or
is
what
may
be
called
departmental
it
is
not
so
much
one
faculty
as
a
collection
of
similar
or
analogous
faculties
under
one
name
there
being
really
as
many
faculties
as
there
are
distinct
though
in
the
same
person
some
of
them
may
if
it
so
happen
be
united
though
some
men
have
a
sort
of
literary
power
in
arguing
in
all
omni
a
power
extensive
but
not
deep
or
real
this
surely
is
the
conclusion
to
which
we
are
brought
by
our
ordinary
experience
of
men
it
is
almost
proverbial
that
a
mathematician
may
have
no
head
at
all
for
what
is
called
historical
evidence
successful
experimentalists
need
not
have
talent
for
legal
research
or
pleading
a
shrewd
man
of
business
may
be
a
bad
arguer
in
philosophical
questions
able
statesmen
and
politicians
have
been
before
now
eccentric
or
superstitious
in
their
religious
views
it
is
notorious
how
ridiculous
a
clever
man
may
make
himself
who
ventures
to
argue
with
professed
theologians
critics
or
geologists
though
without
positive
defects
in
knowledge
of
his
subject
priestley
great
in
electricity
and
chemistry
was
but
a
poor
ecclesiastical
historian
the
author
of
the
minute
philosopher
is
also
the
author
of
the
analyst
newton
wrote
not
only
his
principia
but
his
comments
on
the
apocalypse
cromwell
whose
actions
savoured
of
the
boldest
logic
was
a
confused
speaker
in
these
and
various
similar
instances
the
defect
lay
not
so
much
in
an
ignorance
of
facts
as
in
an
inability
to
handle
those
facts
suitably
in
feeble
or
perverse
modes
of
abstraction
observation
comparison
analysis
inference
which
nothing
could
have
obviated
but
that
which
was
wanting
specific
talent
and
a
ready
exercise
of
it
i
have
already
referred
to
the
faculty
of
memory
in
illustration
it
will
serve
me
also
here
we
can
form
an
abstract
idea
of
memory
and
call
it
one
faculty
which
has
for
its
all
past
facts
of
our
personal
experience
but
this
is
really
only
an
illusion
for
there
is
no
such
gift
of
universal
memory
of
course
we
all
remember
in
a
way
as
we
reason
in
all
but
i
am
speaking
of
remembering
rightly
as
i
spoke
of
reasoning
rightly
in
real
fact
memory
as
a
talent
is
not
one
indivisible
faculty
but
a
power
of
retaining
and
recalling
the
past
in
this
or
that
department
of
our
experience
not
in
any
whatever
two
memories
which
are
both
specially
retentive
may
also
be
incommensurate
some
men
can
recite
the
canto
of
a
poem
or
good
part
of
a
speech
after
once
reading
it
but
have
no
head
for
dates
others
have
great
capacity
for
the
vocabulary
of
languages
but
recollect
nothing
of
the
small
occurrences
of
the
day
or
year
others
never
forget
any
statement
which
they
have
read
and
can
give
volume
and
page
but
have
no
memory
for
faces
i
have
known
those
who
could
without
effort
run
through
the
succession
of
days
on
which
easter
fell
for
years
back
or
could
say
where
they
were
or
what
they
were
doing
on
a
given
day
in
a
given
year
or
could
recollect
accurately
the
christian
names
of
friends
and
strangers
or
could
enumerate
in
exact
order
the
names
on
all
the
shops
from
hyde
park
corner
to
the
bank
or
had
so
mastered
the
university
calendar
as
to
be
able
to
bear
an
examination
in
the
academical
history
of
any
taken
at
random
and
i
believe
in
most
of
these
cases
the
talent
in
its
exceptional
character
did
not
extend
beyond
several
classes
of
subjects
there
are
a
hundred
memories
as
there
are
a
hundred
virtues
virtue
is
one
indeed
in
the
abstract
but
in
fact
gentle
and
kind
natures
are
not
therefore
heroic
and
prudent
and
minds
need
not
be
at
the
utmost
such
virtue
is
one
only
as
developed
in
the
concrete
it
takes
the
shape
of
species
which
in
no
sense
imply
each
other
so
is
it
with
ratiocination
and
as
we
should
betake
ourselves
to
newton
for
physical
not
for
theological
conclusions
and
to
wellington
for
his
military
experience
not
for
statesmanship
so
the
maxim
holds
good
generally
cuique
in
arte
suâ
credendum
est
or
to
use
the
grand
words
of
aristotle
we
are
bound
to
give
heed
to
the
undemonstrated
sayings
and
opinions
of
the
experienced
and
aged
not
less
than
to
demonstrations
because
from
their
having
the
eye
of
experience
they
behold
the
principles
of
things
instead
of
trusting
logical
science
we
must
trust
persons
namely
those
who
by
long
acquaintance
with
their
subject
have
a
right
to
judge
and
if
we
wish
ourselves
to
share
in
their
convictions
and
the
grounds
of
them
we
must
follow
their
history
and
learn
as
they
have
learned
we
must
take
up
their
particular
subject
as
they
took
it
up
beginning
at
the
beginning
give
ourselves
to
it
depend
on
practice
and
experience
more
than
on
reasoning
and
thus
gain
that
mental
insight
into
truth
whatever
its
may
be
which
our
masters
have
gained
before
us
by
following
this
course
we
may
make
ourselves
of
their
number
and
then
we
rightly
lean
upon
ourselves
we
follow
our
own
moral
or
intellectual
judgment
but
not
our
skill
in
argumentation
this
doctrine
stated
in
substance
as
above
by
the
great
philosopher
of
antiquity
is
more
fully
expounded
in
a
passage
which
he
elsewhere
quotes
from
hesiod
best
of
all
is
he
says
that
poet
who
is
wise
by
his
own
wit
next
best
he
who
is
wise
by
the
wit
of
others
but
whoso
is
neither
able
to
see
nor
willing
to
hear
he
is
a
judgment
then
in
all
concrete
matter
is
the
architectonic
faculty
and
what
may
be
called
the
illative
sense
or
right
judgment
in
ratiocination
is
one
branch
of
it
chapter
ix
the
illative
sense
my
object
in
the
foregoing
pages
has
been
not
to
form
a
theory
which
may
account
for
those
phenomena
of
the
intellect
of
which
they
treat
viz
those
which
characterize
inference
and
assent
but
to
ascertain
what
is
the
matter
of
fact
as
regards
them
that
is
when
it
is
that
assent
is
given
to
propositions
which
are
inferred
and
under
what
circumstances
i
have
never
had
the
thought
of
an
attempt
which
would
be
ambitious
in
me
and
which
has
failed
in
the
hands
of
others
if
that
attempt
may
not
unfairly
be
called
unsuccessful
which
though
made
by
the
acutest
minds
has
not
succeeded
in
convincing
opponents
especially
have
i
found
myself
unequal
to
antecedent
reasonings
in
the
instance
of
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
those
who
arguing
maintain
that
since
experience
leads
by
syllogism
only
to
probabilities
certitude
is
ever
a
mistake
there
are
others
who
while
they
deny
this
conclusion
grant
the
principle
assumed
in
the
argument
and
in
consequence
are
obliged
in
order
to
vindicate
the
certainty
of
our
knowledge
to
have
recourse
to
the
hypothesis
of
intuitions
intellectual
forms
and
the
like
which
belong
to
us
by
nature
and
may
be
considered
to
elevate
our
experience
into
something
more
than
it
is
in
itself
earnestly
maintaining
as
i
would
with
this
latter
school
of
philosophers
the
certainty
of
knowledge
i
think
it
enough
to
appeal
to
the
common
voice
of
mankind
in
proof
of
it
that
is
to
be
accounted
a
normal
operation
of
our
nature
which
men
in
general
do
actually
instance
that
is
a
law
of
our
minds
which
is
exemplified
in
action
on
a
large
scale
whether
it
ought
to
be
a
law
or
no
our
hoping
is
a
proof
that
hope
as
such
is
not
an
extravagance
and
our
possession
of
certitude
is
a
proof
that
it
is
not
a
weakness
or
an
absurdity
to
be
certain
how
it
comes
about
that
we
can
be
certain
is
not
my
business
to
determine
for
me
it
is
sufficient
that
certitude
is
felt
this
is
what
the
schoolmen
i
believe
call
treating
a
subject
facto
in
contrast
with
had
i
attempted
the
latter
i
should
have
been
falling
into
metaphysics
but
my
aim
is
of
a
practical
character
such
as
that
of
butler
in
his
with
this
difference
that
he
treats
of
probability
doubt
expedience
and
duty
whereas
in
these
pages
without
excluding
far
from
it
the
question
of
duty
i
would
confine
myself
to
the
truth
of
things
and
to
the
mind
s
certitude
of
that
truth
certitude
is
a
mental
state
certainty
is
a
quality
of
propositions
those
propositions
i
call
certain
which
are
such
that
i
am
certain
of
them
certitude
is
not
a
passive
impression
made
upon
the
mind
from
without
by
argumentative
compulsion
but
in
all
concrete
questions
nay
even
in
abstract
for
though
the
reasoning
is
abstract
the
mind
which
judges
of
it
is
concrete
it
is
an
active
recognition
of
propositions
as
true
such
as
it
is
the
duty
of
each
individual
himself
to
exercise
at
the
bidding
of
reason
and
when
reason
forbids
to
withhold
and
reason
never
bids
us
be
certain
except
on
an
absolute
proof
and
such
a
proof
can
never
be
furnished
to
us
by
the
logic
of
words
for
as
certitude
is
of
the
mind
so
is
the
act
of
inference
which
leads
to
it
every
one
who
reasons
is
his
own
centre
and
no
expedient
for
attaining
a
common
measure
of
minds
can
reverse
this
truth
then
the
question
follows
is
there
any
of
the
accuracy
of
an
inference
such
as
may
be
our
warrant
that
certitude
is
rightly
elicited
in
favour
of
the
proposition
inferred
since
our
warrant
can
not
as
i
have
said
be
scientific
i
have
already
said
that
the
sole
and
final
judgment
on
the
validity
of
an
inference
in
concrete
matter
is
committed
to
the
personal
action
of
the
ratiocinative
faculty
the
perfection
or
virtue
of
which
i
have
called
the
illative
sense
a
use
of
the
word
sense
parallel
to
our
use
of
it
in
good
sense
common
sense
a
sense
of
beauty
i
own
i
do
not
see
any
way
to
go
farther
than
this
in
answer
to
the
question
however
i
can
at
least
explain
my
meaning
more
fully
and
therefore
i
will
now
speak
first
of
the
sanction
of
the
illative
sense
next
of
its
nature
and
then
of
its
range
the
sanction
of
the
illative
sense
we
are
in
a
world
of
facts
and
we
use
them
for
there
is
nothing
else
to
use
we
do
not
quarrel
with
them
but
we
take
them
as
they
are
and
avail
ourselves
of
what
they
can
do
for
us
it
would
be
out
of
place
to
demand
of
fire
water
earth
and
air
their
credentials
so
to
say
for
acting
upon
us
or
ministering
to
us
we
call
them
elements
and
turn
them
to
account
and
make
the
most
of
them
we
speculate
on
them
at
our
leisure
but
what
we
are
still
less
able
to
doubt
about
or
annul
at
our
leisure
or
not
is
that
which
is
at
once
their
counterpart
and
their
witness
i
mean
ourselves
we
are
conscious
of
the
objects
of
external
nature
and
we
reflect
and
act
upon
them
and
this
consciousness
reflection
and
action
we
call
our
rationality
and
as
we
use
the
so
called
elements
without
first
criticizing
what
we
have
no
command
over
so
is
it
much
more
unmeaning
in
us
to
criticize
or
find
fault
with
our
own
nature
which
is
nothing
else
than
we
ourselves
instead
of
using
it
according
to
the
use
of
which
it
ordinarily
admits
our
being
with
its
faculties
mind
and
body
is
a
fact
not
admitting
of
question
all
things
being
of
necessity
referred
to
it
not
it
to
other
things
if
i
may
not
assume
that
i
exist
and
in
a
particular
way
that
is
with
a
particular
mental
constitution
i
have
nothing
to
speculate
about
and
had
better
let
speculation
alone
such
as
i
am
it
is
my
all
this
is
my
essential
and
must
be
taken
for
granted
otherwise
thought
is
but
an
idle
amusement
not
worth
the
trouble
there
is
no
medium
between
using
my
faculties
as
i
have
them
and
flinging
myself
upon
the
external
world
according
to
the
random
impulse
of
the
moment
as
spray
upon
the
surface
of
the
waves
and
simply
forgetting
that
i
am
i
am
what
i
am
or
i
am
nothing
i
can
not
think
reflect
or
judge
about
my
being
without
starting
from
the
very
point
which
i
aim
at
concluding
my
ideas
are
all
assumptions
and
i
am
ever
moving
in
a
circle
i
can
not
avoid
being
sufficient
for
myself
for
i
can
not
make
myself
anything
else
and
to
change
me
is
to
destroy
me
if
i
do
not
use
myself
i
have
no
other
self
to
use
my
only
business
is
to
ascertain
what
i
am
in
order
to
put
it
to
use
it
is
enough
for
the
proof
of
the
value
and
authority
of
any
function
which
i
possess
to
be
able
to
pronounce
that
it
is
natural
what
i
have
to
ascertain
is
the
laws
under
which
i
live
my
first
elementary
lesson
of
duty
is
that
of
resignation
to
the
laws
of
my
nature
whatever
they
are
my
first
disobedience
is
to
be
impatient
at
what
i
am
and
to
indulge
an
ambitious
aspiration
after
what
i
can
not
be
to
cherish
a
distrust
of
my
powers
and
to
desire
to
change
laws
which
are
identical
with
myself
truths
such
as
these
which
are
too
obvious
to
be
called
irresistible
are
illustrated
by
what
we
see
in
universal
nature
every
being
is
in
a
true
sense
sufficient
for
itself
so
as
to
be
able
to
fulfil
its
particular
needs
it
is
a
general
law
that
whatever
is
found
as
a
function
or
an
attribute
of
any
class
of
beings
or
is
natural
to
it
is
in
its
substance
suitable
to
it
and
subserves
its
existence
and
can
not
be
rightly
regarded
as
a
fault
or
enormity
no
being
could
endure
of
which
the
constituent
parts
were
at
war
with
each
other
and
more
than
this
there
is
that
principle
of
vitality
in
every
being
which
is
of
a
sanative
and
restorative
character
and
which
brings
all
its
parts
and
functions
together
into
one
whole
and
is
ever
repelling
and
correcting
the
mischiefs
which
befall
it
whether
from
within
or
without
while
showing
no
tendency
to
cast
off
its
belongings
as
if
foreign
to
its
nature
the
brute
animals
are
found
severally
with
limbs
and
organs
habits
instincts
appetites
surroundings
which
play
together
for
the
safety
and
welfare
of
the
whole
and
after
all
exceptions
may
be
said
each
of
them
to
have
after
its
own
kind
a
perfection
of
nature
man
is
the
highest
of
the
animals
and
more
indeed
than
an
animal
as
having
a
mind
that
is
he
has
a
complex
nature
different
from
theirs
with
a
higher
aim
and
a
specific
perfection
but
still
the
fact
that
other
beings
find
their
good
in
the
use
of
their
particular
nature
is
a
reason
for
anticipating
that
to
use
duly
our
own
is
our
interest
as
well
as
our
necessity
what
is
the
peculiarity
of
our
nature
in
contrast
with
the
inferior
animals
around
us
it
is
that
though
man
can
not
change
what
he
is
born
with
he
is
a
being
of
progress
with
relation
to
his
perfection
and
characteristic
good
other
beings
are
complete
from
their
first
existence
in
that
line
of
excellence
which
is
allotted
to
them
but
man
begins
with
nothing
realized
to
use
the
word
and
he
has
to
make
capital
for
himself
by
the
exercise
of
those
faculties
which
are
his
natural
inheritance
thus
he
gradually
advances
to
the
fulness
of
his
original
destiny
nor
is
this
progress
mechanical
nor
is
it
of
necessity
it
is
committed
to
the
personal
efforts
of
each
individual
of
the
species
each
of
us
has
the
prerogative
of
completing
his
inchoate
and
rudimental
nature
and
of
developing
his
own
perfection
out
of
the
living
elements
with
which
his
mind
began
to
be
it
is
his
gift
to
be
the
creator
of
his
own
sufficiency
and
to
be
emphatically
this
is
the
law
of
his
being
which
he
can
not
escape
and
whatever
is
involved
in
that
law
he
is
bound
or
rather
he
is
carried
on
to
fulfil
and
here
i
am
brought
to
the
bearing
of
these
remarks
upon
my
subject
for
this
law
of
progress
is
carried
out
by
means
of
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
of
which
inference
and
assent
are
the
immediate
instruments
supposing
then
the
advancement
of
our
nature
both
in
ourselves
individually
and
as
regards
the
human
family
is
to
every
one
of
us
in
his
place
a
sacred
duty
it
follows
that
that
duty
is
intimately
bound
up
with
the
right
use
of
these
two
main
instruments
of
fulfilling
it
and
as
we
do
not
gain
the
knowledge
of
the
law
of
progress
by
any
view
of
man
but
by
looking
at
it
as
the
interpretation
which
is
provided
by
himself
on
a
large
scale
in
the
ordinary
action
of
his
intellectual
nature
so
too
we
must
appeal
to
himself
as
a
fact
and
not
to
any
antecedent
theory
in
order
to
find
what
is
the
law
of
his
mind
as
regards
the
two
faculties
in
question
if
then
such
an
appeal
does
bear
me
out
in
deciding
as
i
have
done
that
the
course
of
inference
is
ever
more
or
less
obscure
while
assent
is
ever
distinct
and
definite
and
yet
that
what
is
in
its
nature
thus
absolute
does
in
fact
follow
upon
what
in
outward
manifestation
is
thus
complex
indirect
and
recondite
what
is
left
to
us
but
to
take
things
as
they
are
and
to
resign
ourselves
to
what
we
find
that
is
instead
of
devising
what
can
not
be
some
sufficient
science
of
reasoning
which
may
compel
certitude
in
concrete
conclusions
to
confess
that
there
is
no
ultimate
test
of
truth
besides
the
testimony
born
to
truth
by
the
mind
itself
and
that
this
phenomenon
perplexing
as
we
may
find
it
is
a
normal
and
inevitable
characteristic
of
the
mental
constitution
of
a
being
like
man
on
a
stage
such
as
the
world
his
progress
is
a
living
growth
not
a
mechanism
and
its
instruments
are
mental
acts
not
the
formulas
and
contrivances
of
language
we
are
accustomed
in
this
day
to
lay
great
stress
upon
the
harmony
of
the
universe
and
we
have
well
learned
the
maxim
so
powerfully
inculcated
by
our
own
english
philosopher
that
in
our
inquiries
into
its
laws
we
must
sternly
destroy
all
idols
of
the
intellect
and
subdue
nature
by
with
her
knowledge
is
power
for
it
enables
us
to
use
eternal
principles
which
we
can
not
alter
so
also
is
it
in
that
microcosm
the
human
mind
let
us
follow
bacon
more
closely
than
to
distort
its
faculties
according
to
the
demands
of
an
ideal
optimism
instead
of
looking
out
for
modes
of
thought
proper
to
our
nature
and
faithfully
observing
them
in
our
intellectual
exercises
of
course
i
do
not
stop
here
as
the
structure
of
the
universe
speaks
to
us
of
him
who
made
it
so
the
laws
of
the
mind
are
the
expression
not
of
mere
constituted
order
but
of
his
will
i
should
be
bound
by
them
even
were
they
not
his
laws
but
since
one
of
their
very
functions
is
to
tell
me
of
him
they
throw
a
reflex
light
upon
themselves
and
for
resignation
to
my
destiny
i
substitute
a
cheerful
concurrence
in
an
overruling
providence
we
may
gladly
welcome
such
difficulties
as
there
are
in
our
mental
constitution
and
in
the
interaction
of
our
faculties
if
we
are
able
to
feel
that
he
gave
them
to
us
and
he
can
overrule
them
for
us
we
may
securely
take
them
as
they
are
and
use
them
as
we
find
them
it
is
he
who
teaches
us
all
knowledge
and
the
way
by
which
we
acquire
it
is
his
way
he
varies
that
way
according
to
the
but
whether
he
has
set
before
us
in
our
particular
pursuit
the
way
of
observation
or
of
experiment
of
speculation
or
of
research
of
demonstration
or
of
probability
whether
we
are
inquiring
into
the
system
of
the
universe
or
into
the
elements
of
matter
and
of
life
or
into
the
history
of
human
society
and
past
times
if
we
take
the
way
proper
to
our
we
have
his
blessing
upon
us
and
shall
find
besides
abundant
matter
for
mere
opinion
the
materials
in
due
measure
of
proof
and
assent
and
especially
by
this
disposition
of
things
shall
we
learn
as
regards
religious
and
ethical
inquiries
how
little
we
can
effect
however
much
we
exert
ourselves
without
that
blessing
for
as
if
on
set
purpose
he
has
made
this
path
of
thought
rugged
and
circuitous
above
other
investigations
that
the
very
discipline
inflicted
on
our
minds
in
finding
him
may
mould
them
into
due
devotion
to
him
when
he
is
found
verily
thou
art
a
hidden
god
the
god
of
israel
the
saviour
is
the
very
law
of
his
dealings
with
us
certainly
we
need
a
clue
into
the
labyrinth
which
is
to
lead
us
to
him
and
who
among
us
can
hope
to
seize
upon
the
true
of
thought
for
that
enterprise
and
upon
all
of
them
who
is
to
understand
their
right
direction
to
follow
them
out
to
their
just
limits
and
duly
to
estimate
adjust
and
combine
the
various
reasonings
in
which
they
issue
so
as
safely
to
arrive
at
what
it
is
worth
any
labour
to
secure
without
a
special
illumination
from
himself
such
are
the
dealings
of
wisdom
with
the
elect
soul
she
will
bring
upon
him
fear
and
dread
and
trial
and
she
will
torture
him
with
the
tribulation
of
her
discipline
till
she
try
him
by
her
laws
and
trust
his
soul
then
she
will
strengthen
him
and
make
her
way
straight
to
him
and
give
him
the
nature
of
the
illative
sense
it
is
the
mind
that
reasons
and
that
controls
its
own
reasonings
not
any
technical
apparatus
of
words
and
propositions
this
power
of
judging
and
concluding
when
in
its
perfection
i
call
the
illative
sense
and
i
shall
best
illustrate
it
by
referring
to
parallel
faculties
which
we
commonly
recognize
without
difficulty
for
instance
how
does
the
mind
fulfil
its
function
of
supreme
direction
and
control
in
matters
of
duty
social
intercourse
and
taste
in
all
of
these
separate
actions
of
the
intellect
the
individual
is
supreme
and
responsible
to
himself
nay
under
circumstances
may
be
justified
in
opposing
himself
to
the
judgment
of
the
whole
world
though
he
uses
rules
to
his
great
advantage
as
far
as
they
go
and
is
in
consequence
bound
to
use
them
as
regards
moral
duty
the
subject
is
fully
considered
in
the
ethical
treatises
of
aristotle
he
calls
the
faculty
which
guides
the
mind
in
matters
of
conduct
by
the
name
of
or
judgment
this
is
the
directing
controlling
and
determining
principle
in
such
matters
personal
and
social
what
it
is
to
be
virtuous
how
we
are
to
gain
the
just
idea
and
standard
of
virtue
how
we
are
to
approximate
in
practice
to
our
own
standard
what
is
right
and
wrong
in
a
particular
case
for
the
answers
in
fulness
and
accuracy
to
these
and
similar
questions
the
philosopher
refers
us
to
no
code
of
laws
to
no
moral
treatise
because
no
science
of
life
applicable
to
the
case
of
an
individual
has
been
or
can
be
written
such
is
aristotle
s
doctrine
and
it
is
undoubtedly
true
an
ethical
system
may
supply
laws
general
rules
guiding
principles
a
number
of
examples
suggestions
landmarks
limitations
cautions
distinctions
solutions
of
critical
or
anxious
difficulties
but
who
is
to
apply
them
to
a
particular
case
whither
can
we
go
except
to
the
living
intellect
our
own
or
another
s
what
is
written
is
too
vague
too
negative
for
our
need
it
bids
us
avoid
extremes
but
it
can
not
ascertain
for
us
according
to
our
personal
need
the
golden
mean
the
authoritative
oracle
which
is
to
decide
our
path
is
something
more
searching
and
manifold
than
such
jejune
generalizations
as
treatises
can
give
which
are
most
distinct
and
clear
when
we
least
need
them
it
is
seated
in
the
mind
of
the
individual
who
is
thus
his
own
law
his
own
teacher
and
his
own
judge
in
those
special
cases
of
duty
which
are
personal
to
him
it
comes
of
an
acquired
habit
though
it
has
its
first
origin
in
nature
itself
and
it
is
formed
and
matured
by
practice
and
experience
and
it
manifests
itself
not
in
any
breadth
of
view
any
philosophical
comprehension
of
the
mutual
relations
of
duty
towards
duty
or
any
consistency
in
its
teachings
but
it
is
a
capacity
sufficient
for
the
occasion
deciding
what
ought
to
be
done
here
and
now
by
this
given
person
under
these
given
circumstances
it
decides
nothing
hypothetical
it
does
not
determine
what
a
man
should
do
ten
years
hence
or
what
another
should
do
at
this
time
it
may
indeed
happen
to
decide
ten
years
hence
as
it
does
now
and
to
decide
a
second
case
now
as
it
now
decides
a
first
still
its
present
act
is
for
the
present
not
for
the
distant
or
the
future
state
or
public
law
is
inflexible
but
this
mental
rule
is
not
only
minute
and
particular
but
has
an
elasticity
which
in
its
application
to
individual
cases
is
as
i
have
said
not
studious
to
maintain
the
appearance
of
consistency
in
old
times
the
mason
s
rule
which
was
in
use
at
lesbos
was
according
to
aristotle
not
of
wood
or
iron
but
of
lead
so
as
to
allow
of
its
adjustment
to
the
uneven
surface
of
the
stones
brought
together
for
the
work
by
such
the
philosopher
illustrates
the
nature
of
equity
in
contrast
with
law
and
such
is
that
from
which
the
science
of
morals
forms
its
rules
and
receives
its
complement
in
this
respect
of
course
the
law
of
truth
differs
from
the
law
of
duty
that
duties
change
but
truths
never
but
though
truth
is
ever
one
and
the
same
and
the
assent
of
certitude
is
immutable
still
the
reasonings
which
carry
us
on
to
truth
and
certitude
are
many
and
distinct
and
vary
with
the
inquirer
and
it
is
not
with
assent
but
with
the
controlling
principle
in
inferences
that
i
am
comparing
it
is
with
this
drift
that
i
observe
that
the
rule
of
conduct
for
one
man
is
not
always
the
rule
for
another
though
the
rule
is
always
one
and
the
same
in
the
abstract
and
in
its
principle
and
scope
to
learn
his
own
duty
in
his
own
case
each
individual
must
have
recourse
to
his
own
rule
and
if
his
rule
is
not
sufficiently
developed
in
his
intellect
for
his
need
then
he
goes
to
some
other
living
present
authority
to
supply
it
for
him
not
to
the
dead
letter
of
a
treatise
or
a
code
a
living
present
authority
himself
or
another
is
his
immediate
guide
in
matters
of
a
personal
social
or
political
character
in
buying
and
selling
in
contracts
in
his
treatment
of
others
in
giving
and
receiving
in
thinking
speaking
doing
and
working
in
toil
in
danger
in
his
recreations
and
pleasures
every
one
of
his
acts
to
be
praiseworthy
must
be
in
accordance
with
this
practical
sense
thus
it
is
and
not
by
science
that
he
perfects
the
virtues
of
justice
magnanimity
generosity
gentleness
and
all
others
is
the
regulating
principle
of
every
one
of
them
these
last
words
lead
me
to
a
further
remark
i
doubt
whether
it
is
correct
strictly
speaking
to
consider
this
as
a
general
faculty
directing
and
perfecting
all
the
virtues
at
once
so
understood
it
is
little
better
than
an
abstract
term
including
under
it
a
circle
of
analogous
faculties
severally
proper
to
the
separate
virtues
properly
speaking
there
are
as
many
kinds
of
as
there
are
virtues
for
the
judgment
good
sense
or
tact
which
is
conspicuous
in
a
man
s
conduct
in
one
is
not
necessarily
traceable
in
another
as
in
the
parallel
cases
of
memory
and
reasoning
he
may
be
great
in
one
aspect
of
his
character
and
in
another
he
may
be
exemplary
in
his
family
yet
commit
a
fraud
on
the
revenue
he
may
be
just
and
cruel
brave
and
sensual
imprudent
and
patient
and
if
this
be
true
of
the
moral
virtues
it
holds
good
still
more
fully
when
we
compare
what
is
called
his
private
character
with
his
public
a
good
man
may
make
a
bad
king
profligates
have
been
great
statesmen
or
magnanimous
political
leaders
so
too
i
may
go
on
to
speak
of
the
various
callings
and
professions
which
give
scope
to
the
exercise
of
great
talents
for
these
talents
also
are
matured
not
by
mere
rule
but
by
personal
skill
and
sagacity
they
are
as
diverse
as
pleading
and
conducting
a
debate
in
parliament
swaying
a
public
meeting
and
commanding
an
army
and
here
too
i
observe
that
though
the
directing
principle
in
each
case
is
called
by
the
same
name
skill
tact
or
prudence
there
is
no
one
ruling
faculty
leading
to
eminence
in
all
these
various
lines
of
action
in
common
but
men
will
excel
in
one
of
them
without
any
talent
for
the
rest
the
parallel
may
be
continued
in
the
case
of
the
fine
arts
in
which
though
true
and
scientific
rules
may
be
given
no
one
would
therefore
deny
that
phidias
or
rafael
had
a
far
more
subtle
standard
of
taste
and
a
more
versatile
power
of
embodying
it
in
his
works
than
any
which
he
could
communicate
to
others
in
even
a
series
of
treatises
and
here
again
genius
is
indissolubly
united
to
one
definite
a
poet
is
not
therefore
a
painter
or
an
architect
a
musical
composer
and
so
again
as
regards
the
useful
arts
and
personal
accomplishments
we
use
the
same
word
skill
but
proficiency
in
engineering
or
in
or
again
in
engraving
or
again
in
singing
in
playing
instruments
in
acting
or
in
gymnastic
exercises
is
as
simply
one
with
its
particular
as
the
human
soul
with
its
particular
body
and
is
in
its
own
department
a
sort
of
instinct
or
inspiration
not
an
obedience
to
external
rules
of
criticism
or
of
science
it
is
natural
then
to
ask
the
question
why
ratiocination
should
be
an
exception
to
a
general
law
which
attaches
to
the
intellectual
exercises
of
the
mind
why
it
is
held
to
be
commensurate
with
logical
science
and
why
logic
is
made
an
instrumental
art
sufficient
for
determining
every
sort
of
truth
while
no
one
would
dream
of
making
any
one
formula
however
generalized
a
working
rule
at
once
for
poetry
the
art
of
medicine
and
political
warfare
this
is
what
i
have
to
remark
concerning
the
illative
sense
and
in
explanation
of
its
nature
and
claims
and
on
the
whole
i
have
spoken
of
it
in
four
respects
viewed
in
itself
in
its
in
the
process
it
uses
and
in
its
function
and
scope
first
viewed
in
its
exercise
it
is
one
and
the
same
in
all
concrete
matters
though
employed
in
them
in
different
measures
we
do
not
reason
in
one
way
in
chemistry
or
law
in
another
in
morals
or
religion
but
in
reasoning
on
any
subject
whatever
which
is
concrete
we
proceed
as
far
indeed
as
we
can
by
the
logic
of
language
but
we
are
obliged
to
supplement
it
by
the
more
subtle
and
elastic
logic
of
thought
for
forms
by
themselves
prove
nothing
secondly
it
is
in
fact
attached
to
definite
so
that
a
given
individual
may
possess
it
in
one
department
of
thought
for
instance
history
and
not
in
another
for
instance
philosophy
thirdly
in
coming
to
its
conclusion
it
proceeds
always
in
the
same
way
by
a
method
of
reasoning
which
is
the
elementary
principle
of
that
mathematical
calculus
of
modern
times
which
has
so
wonderfully
extended
the
limits
of
abstract
science
fourthly
in
no
class
of
concrete
reasonings
whether
in
experimental
science
historical
research
or
theology
is
there
any
ultimate
test
of
truth
and
error
in
our
inferences
besides
the
trustworthiness
of
the
illative
sense
that
gives
them
its
sanction
just
as
there
is
no
sufficient
test
of
poetical
excellence
heroic
action
or
conduct
other
than
the
particular
mental
sense
be
it
genius
taste
sense
of
propriety
or
the
moral
sense
to
which
those
are
severally
committed
our
duty
in
each
of
these
is
to
strengthen
and
perfect
the
special
faculty
which
is
its
living
rule
and
in
every
case
as
it
comes
to
do
our
best
and
such
also
is
our
duty
and
our
necessity
as
regards
the
illative
sense
the
range
of
the
illative
sense
great
as
are
the
services
of
language
in
enabling
us
to
extend
the
compass
of
our
inferences
to
test
their
validity
and
to
communicate
them
to
others
still
the
mind
itself
is
more
versatile
and
vigorous
than
any
of
its
works
of
which
language
is
one
and
it
is
only
under
its
penetrating
and
subtle
action
that
the
margin
disappears
which
i
have
described
as
intervening
between
verbal
argumentation
and
conclusions
in
the
concrete
it
determines
what
science
can
not
determine
the
limit
of
converging
probabilities
and
the
reasons
sufficient
for
a
proof
it
is
the
ratiocinative
mind
itself
and
no
trick
of
art
however
simple
in
its
form
and
sure
in
operation
by
which
we
are
able
to
determine
that
a
moving
body
left
to
itself
will
never
stop
and
that
no
man
can
live
without
eating
nor
again
is
it
by
any
diagram
that
we
are
able
to
scrutinize
sort
and
combine
the
many
premisses
which
must
be
first
run
together
before
we
answer
duly
a
given
question
it
is
to
the
living
mind
that
we
must
look
for
the
means
of
using
correctly
principles
of
whatever
kind
facts
or
doctrines
experiences
or
testimonies
true
or
probable
and
of
discerning
what
conclusion
from
these
is
necessary
suitable
or
expedient
when
they
are
taken
for
granted
and
this
either
by
means
of
a
natural
gift
or
from
mental
formation
and
practice
and
a
long
familiarity
with
those
various
thus
when
laud
said
that
he
did
not
see
his
way
to
come
to
terms
with
the
holy
see
till
rome
was
other
than
she
was
no
catholic
would
admit
the
sentiment
but
any
catholic
may
understand
that
this
is
just
the
judgment
consistent
with
laud
s
actual
condition
of
thought
and
cast
of
opinions
his
ecclesiastical
position
and
the
existing
state
of
england
nor
lastly
is
an
action
of
the
mind
itself
less
necessary
in
relation
to
those
first
elements
of
thought
which
in
all
reasoning
are
assumptions
the
principles
tastes
and
opinions
very
often
of
a
personal
character
which
are
half
the
battle
in
the
inference
with
which
the
reasoning
is
to
terminate
it
is
the
mind
itself
that
detects
them
in
their
obscure
recesses
illustrates
them
establishes
them
eliminates
them
resolves
them
into
simpler
ideas
as
the
case
may
be
the
mind
contemplates
them
without
the
use
of
words
by
a
process
which
can
not
be
analyzed
thus
it
was
that
bacon
separated
the
physical
system
of
the
world
from
the
theological
thus
that
butler
connected
together
the
moral
system
with
the
religious
logical
formulas
could
never
have
sustained
the
reasonings
involved
in
such
investigations
thus
the
illative
sense
that
is
the
reasoning
faculty
as
exercised
by
gifted
or
by
educated
or
otherwise
minds
has
its
function
in
the
beginning
middle
and
end
of
all
discussion
and
inquiry
and
in
every
step
of
the
process
it
is
a
rule
to
itself
and
appeals
to
no
judgment
beyond
its
own
and
attends
upon
the
whole
course
of
thought
from
antecedents
to
consequents
with
a
minute
diligence
and
unwearied
presence
which
is
impossible
to
a
cumbrous
apparatus
of
verbal
reasoning
though
in
communicating
with
others
words
are
the
only
instrument
we
possess
and
a
serviceable
though
imperfect
instrument
one
function
indeed
there
is
of
logic
to
which
i
have
referred
in
the
preceding
sentence
which
the
illative
sense
does
not
and
can
not
perform
it
supplies
no
common
measure
between
mind
and
mind
as
being
nothing
else
than
a
personal
gift
or
acquisition
few
there
are
as
i
said
above
who
are
good
reasoners
on
all
two
men
who
reason
well
each
in
his
own
province
of
thought
may
one
or
both
of
them
fail
and
pronounce
opposite
judgments
on
a
question
belonging
to
some
third
province
moreover
all
reasoning
being
from
premisses
and
those
premisses
arising
if
it
so
happen
in
their
first
elements
from
personal
characteristics
in
which
men
are
in
fact
in
essential
and
irremediable
variance
one
with
another
the
ratiocinative
talent
can
do
no
more
than
point
out
where
the
difference
between
them
lies
how
far
it
is
immaterial
when
it
is
worth
while
continuing
an
argument
between
them
and
when
not
now
of
the
three
main
occasions
of
the
exercise
of
the
illative
sense
which
i
have
been
insisting
on
and
which
are
the
measure
of
its
range
the
start
the
course
and
the
issue
of
an
inquiry
i
have
already
in
treating
of
informal
inference
shown
the
place
it
holds
in
the
final
resolution
of
concrete
questions
here
then
it
is
left
to
me
to
illustrate
its
presence
and
action
in
relation
to
the
elementary
premisses
and
again
to
the
conduct
of
an
argument
and
first
of
the
latter
there
has
been
a
great
deal
written
of
late
years
on
the
subject
of
the
state
of
greece
and
rome
during
the
period
let
us
say
before
the
olympiads
in
greece
and
the
war
with
pyrrhus
in
the
annals
of
rome
now
in
a
question
like
this
it
is
plain
that
the
inquirer
has
first
of
all
to
decide
on
the
point
from
which
he
is
to
start
in
the
presence
of
the
received
accounts
on
what
side
from
what
quarter
he
is
to
approach
them
on
what
principles
his
discussion
is
to
be
conducted
what
he
is
to
assume
what
opinions
or
objections
he
is
summarily
to
put
aside
as
nugatory
what
arguments
and
when
he
is
to
consider
as
apposite
what
false
issues
are
to
be
avoided
when
the
state
of
his
arguments
is
ripe
for
a
conclusion
is
he
to
commence
with
absolutely
discarding
all
that
has
hitherto
been
received
or
to
retain
it
in
outline
or
to
make
selections
from
it
or
to
consider
and
interpret
it
as
mythical
or
as
allegorical
or
to
hold
so
much
to
be
trustworthy
or
at
least
of
authority
as
he
can
not
actually
disprove
or
never
to
destroy
except
in
proportion
as
he
can
construct
then
as
to
the
kind
of
arguments
suitable
or
admissible
how
far
are
tradition
analogy
isolated
monuments
and
records
ruins
vague
reports
legends
the
facts
or
sayings
of
later
times
language
popular
proverbs
to
tell
in
the
inquiry
what
are
marks
of
truth
what
of
falsehood
what
is
probable
what
suspicious
what
promises
well
for
discriminating
facts
from
fictions
then
arguments
have
to
be
balanced
against
each
other
and
then
lastly
the
decision
is
to
be
made
whether
any
conclusion
at
all
can
be
drawn
or
whether
any
before
certain
issues
are
tried
and
settled
or
whether
a
probable
conclusion
or
a
certain
it
is
plain
how
incessant
will
be
the
call
here
or
there
for
the
exercise
of
a
definitive
judgment
how
little
that
judgment
will
be
helped
on
by
logic
and
how
intimately
it
will
be
dependent
upon
the
intellectual
complexion
of
the
writer
this
might
be
illustrated
at
great
length
were
it
necessary
from
the
writings
of
any
of
those
able
men
whose
names
are
so
well
known
in
connexion
with
the
subject
i
have
instanced
such
as
niebuhr
clinton
sir
george
lewis
grote
and
colonel
mure
these
authors
have
severally
views
of
their
own
on
the
period
of
history
which
they
have
selected
for
investigation
and
they
are
too
learned
and
logical
not
to
know
and
to
use
to
the
utmost
the
testimonies
by
which
the
facts
which
they
investigate
are
to
be
ascertained
why
then
do
they
differ
so
much
from
each
other
whether
in
their
estimate
of
those
testimonies
or
of
those
facts
because
that
estimate
is
simply
their
own
coming
of
their
own
judgment
and
that
judgment
coming
of
assumptions
of
their
own
explicit
or
implicit
and
those
assumptions
spontaneously
issuing
out
of
the
state
of
thought
respectively
belonging
to
each
of
them
and
all
these
successive
processes
of
minute
reasoning
superintended
and
directed
by
an
intellectual
instrument
far
too
subtle
and
spiritual
to
be
scientific
what
was
niebuhr
s
idea
of
the
office
he
had
undertaken
i
suppose
it
was
to
accept
what
he
found
in
the
historians
of
rome
to
interrogate
it
to
take
it
to
pieces
to
put
it
together
again
to
and
interpret
it
prescription
together
with
internal
consistency
was
to
him
the
evidence
of
fact
and
if
he
pulled
down
he
felt
he
was
bound
to
build
up
very
different
is
the
spirit
of
another
school
of
writers
with
whom
prescription
is
nothing
and
who
will
admit
no
evidence
which
has
not
first
proved
its
right
to
be
admitted
we
are
able
says
niebuhr
to
trace
the
history
of
the
roman
constitution
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
commonwealth
as
accurately
as
we
wish
and
even
more
perfectly
than
the
history
of
many
portions
of
the
middle
but
we
may
rejoice
says
sir
george
lewis
that
the
ingenuity
or
learning
of
niebuhr
should
have
enabled
him
to
advance
many
noble
hypotheses
and
conjectures
respecting
the
form
of
the
early
constitution
of
rome
but
unless
he
can
support
those
hypotheses
by
sufficient
evidence
they
are
not
entitled
to
our
niebuhr
says
a
writer
nearly
related
to
myself
often
expresses
much
contempt
for
mere
incredulous
criticism
and
negative
conclusions
yet
wisely
to
disbelieve
is
our
first
grand
requisite
in
dealing
with
materials
of
mixed
and
sir
george
lewis
again
it
may
be
said
that
there
is
scarcely
any
of
the
leading
conclusions
of
niebuhr
s
work
which
has
not
been
impugned
by
some
subsequent
again
it
is
true
says
niebuhr
that
the
trojan
war
belongs
to
the
region
of
fable
yet
undeniably
it
has
an
historical
but
grote
writes
if
we
are
asked
whether
the
trojan
war
is
not
a
legend
raised
upon
a
basis
of
truth
our
answer
must
be
that
as
the
possibility
of
it
can
not
be
denied
so
neither
can
the
reality
of
it
be
on
the
other
hand
clinton
lays
down
the
general
rule
we
may
acknowledge
as
real
persons
all
those
whom
there
is
no
reason
for
rejecting
the
presumption
is
in
favour
of
the
early
tradition
if
no
argument
can
be
brought
to
overthrow
thus
he
lodges
the
with
those
who
impugn
the
received
accounts
but
grote
and
sir
george
lewis
throw
it
upon
those
who
defend
them
historical
evidence
says
the
latter
is
founded
on
the
testimony
of
credible
and
again
it
is
perpetually
assumed
in
practice
that
historical
evidence
is
different
in
its
nature
from
other
sorts
of
evidence
this
laxity
seems
to
be
justified
by
the
doctrine
of
taking
the
best
evidence
which
can
be
obtained
the
object
of
my
inquiry
will
be
to
apply
to
the
early
roman
history
the
same
rules
of
evidence
which
are
applied
by
common
consent
to
modern
far
less
severe
is
the
judgment
of
colonel
mure
where
no
positive
historical
proof
is
affirmable
the
balance
of
historical
probability
must
reduce
itself
very
much
to
a
reasonable
indulgence
to
the
weight
of
national
conviction
and
a
deference
to
the
testimony
of
the
earliest
native
reasonable
indulgence
to
popular
belief
deference
to
ancient
tradition
are
principles
of
writing
history
abhorrent
to
the
judicial
temper
of
sir
george
lewis
he
considers
the
words
reasonable
indulgence
to
be
ambiguous
and
observes
that
the
very
point
which
can
not
be
taken
for
granted
and
in
which
writers
differ
is
as
to
the
extent
to
which
contemporary
attestation
may
be
presumed
without
direct
and
positive
proof
the
extent
to
which
the
existence
of
a
popular
belief
concerning
a
supposed
matter
of
fact
authorizes
the
inference
that
it
grew
out
of
authentic
and
grote
observes
to
the
same
effect
the
word
is
an
equivocal
word
and
begs
the
whole
question
it
is
tacitly
understood
to
imply
a
tale
descriptive
of
some
real
matter
of
fact
taking
rise
at
the
time
when
the
fact
happened
originally
accurate
but
corrupted
by
oral
and
lewis
who
quotes
the
passage
adds
this
is
the
of
the
whole
i
am
not
contrasting
these
various
opinions
of
able
men
who
have
given
themselves
to
historical
research
as
if
it
were
any
reflection
on
them
that
they
differ
from
each
other
it
is
the
cause
of
their
differing
on
which
i
wish
to
insist
taking
the
facts
by
themselves
probably
these
authors
would
come
to
no
conclusion
at
all
it
is
the
tacit
understandings
which
grote
speaks
of
the
vague
and
impalpable
notions
of
reasonableness
on
his
own
side
as
well
as
on
that
of
others
which
both
make
conclusions
possible
and
are
the
pledge
of
their
being
contradictory
the
conclusions
vary
with
the
particular
writer
for
each
writes
from
his
own
point
of
view
and
with
his
own
principles
and
these
admit
of
no
common
measure
this
in
fact
is
their
own
account
of
the
matter
the
results
of
speculative
historical
inquiry
says
colonel
mure
can
rarely
amount
to
more
than
fair
presumption
of
the
reality
of
the
events
in
question
as
limited
to
their
general
substance
not
as
extending
to
their
details
nor
can
there
consequently
be
expected
in
the
minds
of
different
inquirers
any
such
unity
regarding
the
precise
degree
of
reality
as
may
frequently
exist
in
respect
to
events
attested
by
documentary
grote
corroborates
this
decision
by
the
striking
instance
of
the
diversity
of
existing
opinions
concerning
the
homeric
poems
our
means
of
knowledge
he
says
are
so
limited
that
no
one
can
produce
arguments
sufficiently
cogent
to
contend
against
opposing
preconceptions
and
it
creates
a
painful
sensation
of
diffidence
when
we
read
the
expressions
of
equal
and
absolute
persuasion
with
which
the
two
opposite
conclusions
have
both
been
and
again
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
best
critics
which
is
probably
not
destined
to
be
adjusted
since
so
much
depends
partly
upon
critical
feeling
partly
upon
the
general
reasonings
in
respect
to
ancient
epical
unity
with
which
a
man
sits
down
to
the
exactly
so
every
one
has
his
own
critical
feeling
his
antecedent
reasonings
and
in
consequence
his
own
absolute
persuasion
coming
in
fresh
and
fresh
at
every
turn
of
the
discussion
and
who
whether
stranger
or
friend
is
to
reach
and
affect
what
is
so
intimately
bound
up
with
the
mental
constitution
of
each
hence
the
categorical
contradictions
between
one
writer
and
another
which
abound
colonel
mure
appeals
in
defence
of
an
historical
thesis
to
the
fact
of
the
hellenic
confederacy
combining
for
the
adoption
of
a
common
national
system
of
chronology
in
grote
replies
nothing
is
more
at
variance
with
my
conception
just
now
spoke
of
the
preconceptions
of
others
of
the
state
of
the
hellenic
world
in
than
the
idea
of
a
combination
among
all
the
members
of
the
race
for
any
purpose
much
more
for
the
purpose
of
adopting
a
common
national
system
of
colonel
mure
speaks
of
the
bigoted
athenian
public
grote
replies
that
no
public
ever
less
deserved
the
epithet
of
bigoted
than
the
athenian
colonel
mure
also
speaks
of
grote
s
arbitrary
hypothesis
and
again
in
grote
s
words
of
his
unreasonable
he
can
not
disprove
by
mere
argument
the
conclusions
of
grote
he
can
but
have
recourse
to
a
personal
criticism
he
virtually
says
we
differ
in
our
personal
view
of
men
become
personal
when
logic
fails
it
is
their
mode
of
appealing
to
their
own
primary
elements
of
thought
and
their
own
illative
sense
against
the
principles
and
the
judgment
of
another
i
have
already
touched
upon
niebuhr
s
method
of
investigation
and
sir
george
lewis
s
dislike
of
it
it
supplies
us
with
as
apposite
an
instance
of
a
difference
in
first
principles
as
is
afforded
by
grote
and
colonel
mure
the
main
characteristic
of
his
history
says
lewis
is
the
extent
to
which
he
relies
upon
internal
evidence
and
upon
the
indications
afforded
by
the
narrative
itself
independently
of
the
testimony
of
its
and
ingenuity
and
labour
can
produce
nothing
but
hypotheses
and
conjectures
which
may
be
supported
by
analogies
but
can
never
rest
upon
the
solid
foundation
of
and
it
is
undeniable
that
rightly
or
wrongly
disdaining
the
scepticism
of
the
mere
critic
niebuhr
does
consciously
proceed
by
the
high
path
of
divination
for
my
own
part
he
says
i
that
since
the
censorship
of
fabius
and
decius
falls
in
the
same
year
that
cn
flavius
became
mediator
between
his
own
class
and
the
higher
lewis
considers
this
to
be
a
process
of
guessing
and
says
instead
of
employing
those
tests
of
credibility
which
are
consistently
applied
to
modern
history
niebuhr
and
his
followers
and
most
of
his
opponents
attempt
to
guide
their
judgment
by
the
indication
of
internal
evidence
and
assume
that
the
truth
is
discovered
by
an
occult
faculty
of
historical
niebuhr
defends
himself
thus
the
real
geographer
has
a
tact
which
determines
his
judgment
and
choice
among
different
statements
he
is
able
from
isolated
statements
to
draw
inferences
respecting
things
that
are
unknown
which
are
closely
approximate
to
results
obtained
from
observation
of
facts
and
may
supply
their
place
he
is
able
with
limited
data
to
form
an
image
of
things
which
no
eyewitness
has
he
applies
this
to
himself
the
principle
set
forth
in
this
passage
is
obviously
the
same
as
i
should
put
forward
myself
but
sir
george
lewis
though
not
simply
denying
it
as
a
principle
makes
little
account
of
it
when
applied
to
historical
research
it
is
not
enough
he
says
for
an
historian
to
claim
the
possession
of
a
retrospective
which
is
denied
to
the
rest
of
the
a
mysterious
doctrine
revealed
only
to
the
and
he
pronounces
that
the
history
of
niebuhr
has
opened
more
questions
than
it
has
closed
and
it
has
set
in
motion
a
large
body
of
combatants
whose
mutual
variances
are
not
at
present
likely
to
be
settled
by
deference
to
a
common
principle
we
see
from
the
above
extracts
how
a
controversy
such
as
that
to
which
they
belong
is
carried
on
from
and
with
collateral
aids
not
formally
proved
but
more
or
less
assumed
the
process
of
assumption
lying
in
the
action
of
the
illative
sense
as
applied
to
primary
elements
of
thought
respectively
congenial
to
the
disputants
not
that
explicit
argumentation
on
these
minute
or
minor
though
important
points
is
not
sometimes
possible
to
a
certain
extent
but
as
i
had
said
it
is
too
unwieldy
an
expedient
for
a
constantly
recurring
need
even
when
it
is
tolerably
exact
and
now
secondly
as
to
the
first
principles
themselves
in
illustration
i
will
mention
under
separate
heads
some
of
those
elementary
contrarieties
of
opinion
on
which
the
illative
sense
has
to
act
discovering
them
following
them
out
defending
or
resisting
them
as
the
case
may
be
as
to
the
statement
of
the
case
this
depends
on
the
particular
aspect
under
which
we
view
a
subject
that
is
on
the
abstraction
which
forms
our
representative
notion
of
what
it
is
sciences
are
only
so
many
distinct
aspects
of
nature
sometimes
suggested
by
nature
itself
sometimes
created
by
the
mind
one
of
the
simplest
and
broadest
aspects
under
which
to
view
the
physical
world
is
that
of
a
system
of
final
causes
or
on
the
other
hand
of
initial
or
effective
causes
bacon
having
it
in
view
to
extend
our
power
over
nature
adopted
the
latter
he
took
firm
hold
of
the
idea
of
causation
in
the
common
sense
of
the
word
as
contrasted
with
that
of
design
refusing
to
mix
up
the
two
ideas
in
one
inquiry
and
denouncing
such
traditional
interpretations
of
facts
as
did
but
obscure
the
simplicity
of
the
aspect
necessary
for
his
purpose
he
saw
what
others
before
him
might
have
seen
in
what
they
saw
but
who
did
not
see
as
he
saw
it
in
this
achievement
of
intellect
which
has
been
so
fruitful
in
results
lie
his
genius
and
his
fame
so
again
to
refer
to
a
very
different
we
often
hear
of
the
exploits
of
some
great
lawyer
judge
or
advocate
who
is
able
in
perplexed
cases
when
common
minds
see
nothing
but
a
hopeless
heap
of
facts
foreign
or
contrary
to
each
other
to
detect
the
principle
which
rightly
interprets
the
riddle
and
to
the
admiration
of
all
hearers
converts
a
chaos
into
an
orderly
and
luminous
whole
this
is
what
is
meant
by
originality
in
thinking
it
is
the
discovery
of
an
aspect
of
a
simpler
perhaps
and
more
intelligible
than
any
hitherto
taken
on
the
other
hand
such
aspects
are
often
unreal
as
being
mere
exhibitions
of
ingenuity
not
of
true
originality
of
mind
this
is
especially
the
case
in
what
are
called
philosophical
views
of
history
such
seems
to
me
the
theory
advocated
in
a
work
of
great
learning
vigour
and
acuteness
warburton
s
divine
legation
of
i
do
not
call
gibbon
merely
ingenious
still
his
account
of
the
rise
of
christianity
is
the
mere
subjective
view
of
one
who
could
not
enter
into
its
depth
and
power
the
aspect
under
which
we
view
things
is
often
intensely
personal
nay
even
awfully
so
considering
that
from
the
nature
of
the
case
it
does
not
bring
home
its
idiosyncrasy
either
to
ourselves
or
to
others
each
of
us
looks
at
the
world
in
his
own
way
and
does
not
know
that
perhaps
it
is
characteristically
his
own
this
is
the
case
even
as
regards
the
senses
some
men
have
little
perception
of
colours
some
recognize
one
or
two
to
some
men
two
contrary
colours
as
red
and
green
are
one
and
the
same
how
poorly
can
we
appreciate
the
beauties
of
nature
if
our
eyes
discern
on
the
face
of
things
only
an
or
a
drab
creation
so
again
as
regards
form
each
of
us
abstracts
the
relation
of
line
to
line
in
his
own
personal
way
one
man
might
apprehend
a
curve
as
convex
another
as
concave
of
course
as
in
the
case
of
a
curve
there
may
be
a
limit
to
possible
aspects
but
still
even
when
we
agree
together
it
is
not
perhaps
that
we
learn
one
from
another
or
fall
under
any
law
of
agreement
but
that
our
separate
idiosyncrasies
happen
to
concur
i
fear
i
may
seem
trifling
if
i
allude
to
an
illustration
which
has
ever
had
a
great
force
with
me
and
that
for
the
very
reason
it
is
so
trivial
and
minute
children
learning
to
read
are
sometimes
presented
with
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
turned
into
the
figures
of
men
in
various
attitudes
it
is
curious
to
observe
from
such
representations
how
differently
the
shape
of
the
letters
strikes
different
minds
in
consequence
i
have
continually
asked
the
question
in
a
chance
company
which
way
certain
of
the
great
letters
look
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
and
whereas
nearly
every
one
present
had
his
own
clear
view
so
clear
that
he
could
not
endure
the
opposite
view
still
i
have
generally
found
that
one
half
of
the
party
considered
the
letters
in
question
to
look
to
the
left
while
the
other
half
thought
they
looked
to
the
right
this
variety
of
interpretation
in
the
very
elements
of
outlines
seems
to
throw
light
upon
other
cognate
differences
between
one
man
and
another
if
they
look
at
the
mere
letters
of
the
alphabet
so
differently
we
may
understand
how
it
is
they
form
such
distinct
judgments
upon
handwriting
nay
how
some
men
may
have
a
talent
for
decyphering
from
it
the
intellectual
and
moral
character
of
the
writer
which
others
have
not
another
thought
that
occurs
is
that
perhaps
here
lies
the
explanation
why
it
is
that
family
likenesses
are
so
variously
recognized
and
how
mistakes
in
identity
may
be
dangerously
frequent
if
we
so
variously
apprehend
the
familiar
objects
of
sense
still
more
various
we
may
suppose
are
the
aspects
and
associations
attached
by
us
one
with
another
to
intellectual
objects
i
do
not
say
we
differ
in
the
objects
themselves
but
that
we
may
have
interminable
differences
as
to
their
relations
and
circumstances
i
have
heard
say
again
to
take
a
trifling
matter
that
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
it
was
a
subject
of
serious
nay
of
angry
controversy
whether
it
began
with
january
or
january
argument
which
ought
if
in
any
case
to
have
easily
brought
the
question
to
a
decision
was
but
sprinkling
water
upon
a
flame
i
am
not
clear
that
if
it
could
be
fairly
started
now
it
would
not
lead
to
similar
results
certainly
i
know
those
who
studiously
withdraw
from
giving
an
opinion
on
the
subject
when
it
is
accidentally
mooted
from
their
experience
of
the
eager
feeling
which
it
is
sure
to
excite
in
some
one
or
other
who
is
present
this
eagerness
can
only
arise
from
an
overpowering
sense
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
lies
in
the
one
alternative
and
not
in
the
other
these
instances
because
they
are
so
casual
suggest
how
it
comes
to
pass
that
men
differ
so
widely
from
each
other
in
religious
and
moral
perceptions
here
i
say
again
it
does
not
prove
that
there
is
no
objective
truth
because
not
all
men
are
in
possession
of
it
or
that
we
are
not
responsible
for
the
associations
which
we
attach
and
the
relations
which
we
assign
to
the
objects
of
the
intellect
but
this
it
does
suggest
to
us
that
there
is
something
deeper
in
our
differences
than
the
accident
of
external
circumstances
and
that
we
need
the
interposition
of
a
power
greater
than
human
teaching
and
human
argument
to
make
our
beliefs
true
and
our
minds
one
next
i
come
to
the
implicit
assumption
of
definite
propositions
in
the
first
start
of
a
course
of
reasoning
and
the
arbitrary
exclusion
of
others
of
whatever
kind
unless
we
had
the
right
when
we
pleased
of
ruling
that
propositions
were
irrelevant
or
absurd
i
do
not
see
how
we
could
conduct
an
argument
at
all
our
way
would
be
simply
blocked
up
by
extravagant
principles
and
theories
gratuitous
hypotheses
false
issues
unsupported
statements
and
incredible
facts
there
are
those
who
have
treated
the
history
of
abraham
as
an
astronomical
record
and
have
spoken
of
our
adorable
saviour
as
the
sun
in
arabian
mythology
has
changed
solomon
into
a
mighty
wizard
noah
has
been
considered
the
patriarch
of
the
chinese
people
the
ten
tribes
have
been
pronounced
still
to
live
in
their
descendants
the
red
indians
or
to
be
the
ancestors
of
the
goths
and
vandals
and
thereby
of
the
present
european
races
some
have
conjectured
that
the
apollos
of
the
acts
of
the
apostles
was
apollonius
tyaneus
able
men
have
reasoned
out
almost
against
their
will
that
adam
was
a
negro
these
propositions
and
many
others
of
various
kinds
we
should
think
ourselves
justified
in
passing
over
if
we
were
engaged
in
a
work
on
sacred
history
and
there
are
others
on
the
contrary
which
we
should
assume
as
true
by
our
own
right
and
without
notice
and
without
which
we
could
not
set
about
or
carry
on
our
work
however
the
right
of
making
assumptions
has
been
disputed
but
when
the
objections
are
examined
i
think
they
only
go
to
show
that
we
have
no
right
in
argument
to
make
any
assumption
we
please
thus
in
the
historical
researches
which
just
now
came
before
us
it
seems
fair
to
say
that
no
testimony
should
be
received
except
such
as
comes
from
competent
witnesses
while
it
is
not
unfair
to
urge
on
the
other
side
that
tradition
though
unauthenticated
being
what
is
called
in
possession
has
a
prescription
in
its
favour
and
may
or
provisionally
be
received
here
are
the
materials
of
a
fair
dispute
but
there
are
writers
who
seem
to
have
gone
far
beyond
this
reasonable
scepticism
laying
down
as
a
general
proposition
that
we
have
no
right
in
philosophy
to
make
any
assumption
whatever
and
that
we
ought
to
begin
with
a
universal
doubt
this
however
is
of
all
assumptions
the
greatest
and
to
forbid
assumptions
universally
is
to
forbid
this
one
in
particular
doubt
itself
is
a
positive
state
and
implies
a
definite
habit
of
mind
and
thereby
necessarily
involves
a
system
of
principles
and
doctrines
all
its
own
again
if
nothing
is
to
be
assumed
what
is
our
very
method
of
reasoning
but
an
assumption
and
what
our
nature
itself
the
very
sense
of
pleasure
and
pain
which
is
one
of
the
most
intimate
portions
of
ourselves
inevitably
translates
itself
into
intellectual
assumptions
of
the
two
i
would
rather
have
to
maintain
that
we
ought
to
begin
with
believing
everything
that
is
offered
to
our
acceptance
than
that
it
is
our
duty
to
doubt
of
everything
the
former
indeed
seems
the
true
way
of
learning
in
that
case
we
soon
discover
and
discard
what
is
contradictory
to
itself
and
error
having
always
some
portion
of
truth
in
it
and
the
truth
having
a
reality
which
error
has
not
we
may
expect
that
when
there
is
an
honest
purpose
and
fair
talents
we
shall
somehow
make
our
way
forward
the
error
falling
off
from
the
mind
and
the
truth
developing
and
occupying
it
thus
it
is
that
the
catholic
religion
is
reached
as
we
see
by
inquirers
from
all
points
of
the
compass
as
if
it
mattered
not
where
a
man
began
so
that
he
had
an
eye
and
a
heart
for
the
truth
an
argument
has
been
often
put
forward
by
unbelievers
i
think
by
paine
to
this
effect
that
a
revelation
which
is
to
be
received
as
true
ought
to
be
written
on
the
this
appeals
to
the
of
the
many
with
great
force
and
implies
the
assumption
of
a
principle
which
butler
indeed
would
not
grant
and
would
consider
unphilosophical
and
yet
i
think
something
may
be
said
in
its
favour
whether
abstractedly
defensible
or
not
catholic
populations
would
not
be
averse
to
admitting
it
till
these
last
centuries
the
visible
church
was
at
least
to
her
children
the
light
of
the
world
as
conspicuous
as
the
sun
in
the
heavens
and
the
creed
was
written
on
her
forehead
and
proclaimed
through
her
voice
by
a
teaching
as
precise
as
it
was
emphatical
in
accordance
with
the
text
who
is
she
that
looketh
forth
at
the
dawn
fair
as
the
moon
bright
as
the
sun
terrible
as
an
army
set
in
array
it
was
not
strictly
speaking
a
miracle
doubtless
but
in
its
effect
nay
in
its
circumstances
it
was
little
less
of
course
i
would
not
allow
that
the
church
fails
in
this
manifestation
of
the
truth
now
any
more
than
in
former
times
though
the
clouds
have
come
over
the
sun
for
what
she
has
lost
in
her
appeal
to
the
imagination
she
has
gained
in
philosophical
cogency
by
the
evidence
of
her
persistent
vitality
so
far
is
clear
that
if
paine
s
aphorism
has
a
force
against
christianity
it
owes
this
advantage
to
the
miserable
deeds
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
another
conflict
of
first
principles
or
assumptions
which
have
often
been
implicit
on
either
side
has
been
carried
through
in
our
day
and
relates
to
the
end
and
scope
of
civil
society
that
is
whether
government
and
legislation
ought
to
be
of
a
religious
character
or
not
whether
the
state
has
a
conscience
whether
christianity
is
the
law
of
the
land
whether
the
magistrate
in
punishing
offenders
exercises
a
retributive
office
or
a
corrective
or
whether
the
whole
structure
of
society
is
raised
upon
the
basis
of
secular
expediency
the
relation
of
philosophy
and
the
sciences
to
theology
comes
into
the
question
the
old
theory
has
during
the
last
forty
years
been
vigorously
contending
with
the
new
and
the
new
is
in
the
ascendant
there
is
another
great
conflict
of
first
principles
and
that
among
christians
which
has
occupied
a
large
space
in
our
domestic
history
during
the
last
thirty
or
forty
years
and
that
is
the
controversy
about
the
rule
of
faith
i
notice
it
as
affording
an
instance
of
an
assumption
so
deeply
sunk
into
the
popular
mind
that
it
is
a
work
of
great
difficulty
to
obtain
from
its
maintainers
an
acknowledgment
that
it
is
an
assumption
that
scripture
is
the
rule
of
faith
is
in
fact
an
assumption
so
congenial
to
the
state
of
mind
and
course
of
thought
usual
among
protestants
that
it
seems
to
them
rather
a
truism
than
a
truth
if
they
are
in
controversy
with
catholics
on
any
point
of
faith
they
at
once
ask
where
do
you
find
it
in
scripture
and
if
catholics
reply
as
they
must
do
that
it
is
not
necessarily
in
scripture
in
order
to
be
true
nothing
can
persuade
them
that
such
an
answer
is
not
an
evasion
and
a
triumph
to
themselves
yet
it
is
by
no
means
that
all
religious
truth
is
to
be
found
in
a
number
of
works
however
sacred
which
were
written
at
different
times
and
did
not
always
form
one
book
and
in
fact
it
is
a
doctrine
very
hard
to
prove
so
much
so
that
years
ago
when
i
was
considering
it
from
a
protestant
point
of
view
and
wished
to
defend
it
to
the
best
of
my
power
i
was
unable
to
give
any
better
account
of
it
than
the
following
which
i
here
quote
from
its
appositeness
to
my
present
subject
it
matters
not
i
said
speaking
of
the
first
protestants
whether
or
not
they
only
happened
to
come
right
on
what
in
a
logical
point
of
view
are
faulty
premisses
they
had
no
time
for
theories
of
any
kind
and
to
require
theories
at
their
hand
argues
an
ignorance
of
human
nature
and
of
the
ways
in
which
truth
is
struck
out
in
the
course
of
life
common
sense
chance
moral
perception
genius
the
great
discoverers
of
principles
do
not
reason
they
have
no
arguments
no
grounds
they
see
the
truth
but
they
do
not
know
how
they
see
it
and
if
at
any
time
they
attempt
to
prove
it
it
is
as
much
a
matter
of
experiment
with
them
as
if
they
had
to
find
a
road
to
a
distant
mountain
which
they
see
with
the
eye
and
they
get
entangled
embarrassed
and
perchance
overthrown
in
the
superfluous
endeavour
it
is
the
men
though
most
useful
in
their
place
who
prove
reconcile
finish
and
explain
probably
the
popular
feeling
of
the
sixteenth
century
saw
the
bible
to
be
the
word
of
god
so
as
nothing
else
is
his
word
by
the
power
of
a
strong
sense
by
a
sort
of
moral
instinct
or
by
a
happy
augury
that
is
i
considered
the
assumption
an
act
of
the
illative
sense
should
now
add
the
illative
sense
acting
on
mistaken
elements
of
thought
after
the
aspects
in
which
a
question
is
to
be
viewed
and
the
principles
on
which
it
is
to
be
considered
come
the
arguments
by
which
it
is
decided
among
these
are
antecedent
reasons
which
are
especially
in
point
here
because
they
are
in
great
measure
made
by
ourselves
and
belong
to
our
personal
character
and
to
them
i
shall
confine
myself
antecedent
reasoning
when
negative
is
safe
thus
no
one
would
say
that
because
alexander
s
rash
heroism
is
one
of
the
leading
characteristics
of
his
history
therefore
we
are
justified
except
in
writing
a
romance
in
asserting
that
at
a
particular
time
and
place
he
distinguished
himself
by
a
certain
exploit
about
which
history
is
altogether
silent
but
on
the
other
hand
his
notorious
bravery
would
be
almost
decisive
against
any
charge
against
him
of
having
on
a
particular
occasion
acted
as
a
coward
in
like
manner
good
character
goes
far
in
destroying
the
force
of
even
plausible
charges
there
is
indeed
a
degree
of
evidence
in
support
of
an
allegation
against
which
reputation
is
no
defence
but
it
must
be
singularly
strong
to
overcome
an
established
antecedent
probability
which
stands
opposed
to
it
thus
historical
personages
or
great
authors
men
of
high
and
pure
character
have
had
imputations
cast
upon
them
easy
to
make
difficult
or
impossible
to
meet
which
are
indignantly
trodden
under
foot
by
all
just
and
sensible
men
as
being
as
as
they
are
inhuman
i
need
not
add
what
a
cruel
and
despicable
part
a
husband
or
a
son
would
play
who
readily
listened
to
a
charge
against
his
wife
or
his
father
yet
all
this
being
admitted
a
great
number
of
cases
remain
which
are
perplexing
and
on
which
we
can
not
adjust
the
claims
of
conflicting
and
heterogeneous
arguments
except
by
the
keen
and
subtle
operation
of
the
illative
sense
butler
s
argument
in
his
is
such
a
presumption
used
negatively
objection
being
brought
against
certain
characteristics
of
christianity
he
meets
it
by
the
presumption
in
their
favour
derived
from
their
parallels
as
discoverable
in
the
order
of
nature
arguing
that
they
do
not
tell
against
the
divine
origin
of
christianity
unless
they
tell
against
the
divine
origin
of
the
natural
system
also
but
he
could
not
adduce
it
as
a
positive
and
direct
proof
of
the
divine
origin
of
the
christian
doctrines
that
they
had
their
parallels
in
nature
or
at
the
utmost
as
more
than
a
recommendation
of
them
to
the
religious
inquirer
unbelievers
use
the
antecedent
argument
from
the
order
of
nature
against
our
belief
in
miracles
here
if
they
only
mean
that
the
fact
of
that
system
of
laws
by
which
physical
nature
is
governed
makes
it
antecedently
improbable
that
an
exception
should
occur
in
it
there
is
no
objection
to
the
argument
but
if
as
is
not
uncommon
they
mean
that
the
fact
of
an
established
order
is
absolutely
fatal
to
the
very
notion
of
an
exception
they
are
using
a
presumption
as
if
it
were
a
proof
they
are
saying
has
happened
times
one
way
can
not
possibly
happen
on
the
time
another
way
what
has
happened
times
one
way
is
likely
to
happen
in
the
same
way
on
the
if
however
they
mean
that
the
order
of
nature
constitutes
a
physical
necessity
and
that
a
law
is
an
unalterable
fate
this
is
to
assume
the
very
point
in
debate
and
is
much
more
than
its
antecedent
probability
facts
can
not
be
proved
by
presumptions
yet
it
is
remarkable
that
in
cases
where
nothing
stronger
than
presumption
was
even
professed
scientific
men
have
sometimes
acted
as
if
they
thought
this
kind
of
argument
taken
by
itself
decisive
of
a
fact
which
was
in
debate
in
the
controversy
about
the
plurality
of
worlds
it
has
been
considered
on
purely
antecedent
grounds
as
far
as
i
see
to
be
so
necessary
that
the
creator
should
have
filled
with
living
beings
the
luminaries
which
we
see
in
the
sky
and
the
other
cosmical
bodies
which
we
imagine
there
that
it
almost
amounts
to
a
blasphemy
to
doubt
it
theological
conclusions
it
is
true
have
often
been
made
on
antecedent
reasoning
but
then
it
must
be
recollected
that
theological
reasoning
professes
to
be
sustained
by
a
more
than
human
power
and
to
be
guaranteed
by
a
more
than
human
authority
it
may
be
true
also
that
conversions
to
christianity
have
often
been
made
on
antecedent
reasons
yet
even
admitting
the
fact
which
is
not
quite
clear
a
number
of
antecedent
probabilities
confirming
each
other
may
make
it
a
duty
in
the
judgment
of
a
prudent
man
not
only
to
act
as
if
a
statement
were
true
but
actually
to
accept
and
believe
it
this
is
not
unfrequently
instanced
in
our
dealings
with
others
when
we
feel
it
right
in
spite
of
our
misgivings
to
oblige
ourselves
to
believe
their
honesty
and
in
all
these
delicate
questions
there
is
constant
call
for
the
exercise
of
the
illative
sense
chapter
x
inference
and
assent
in
the
matter
of
religion
and
now
i
have
completed
my
review
of
the
second
subject
to
which
i
have
given
my
attention
in
this
essay
the
connexion
existing
between
the
intellectual
acts
of
assent
and
inference
my
first
being
the
connexion
of
assent
with
apprehension
and
as
i
closed
my
remarks
upon
assent
and
apprehension
by
applying
the
conclusions
at
which
i
had
arrived
to
our
belief
in
the
truths
of
religion
so
now
i
ought
to
speak
of
its
evidences
before
quitting
the
consideration
of
the
dependence
of
assent
upon
inference
i
shall
attempt
to
do
so
in
this
chapter
not
without
much
anxiety
lest
i
should
injure
so
large
momentous
and
sacred
a
subject
by
a
necessarily
cursory
treatment
i
begin
with
expressing
a
sentiment
which
is
habitually
in
my
thoughts
whenever
they
are
turned
to
the
subject
of
mental
or
moral
science
and
which
i
am
as
willing
to
apply
here
to
the
evidences
of
religion
as
it
properly
applies
to
metaphysics
or
ethics
viz
that
in
these
provinces
of
inquiry
egotism
is
true
modesty
in
religious
inquiry
each
of
us
can
speak
only
for
himself
and
for
himself
he
has
a
right
to
speak
his
own
experiences
are
enough
for
himself
but
he
can
not
speak
for
others
he
can
not
lay
down
the
law
he
can
only
bring
his
own
experiences
to
the
common
stock
of
psychological
facts
he
knows
what
has
satisfied
and
satisfies
himself
if
it
satisfies
him
it
is
likely
to
satisfy
others
if
as
he
believes
and
is
sure
it
is
true
it
will
approve
itself
to
others
also
for
there
is
but
one
truth
and
doubtless
he
does
find
in
fact
that
allowing
for
the
difference
of
minds
and
of
modes
of
speech
what
convinces
him
does
convince
others
also
there
will
be
very
many
exceptions
but
these
will
admit
of
explanation
great
numbers
of
men
refuse
to
inquire
at
all
they
put
the
subject
of
religion
aside
altogether
others
are
not
serious
enough
to
care
about
questions
of
truth
and
duty
and
to
entertain
them
and
to
numbers
from
their
temper
of
mind
or
the
absence
of
doubt
or
a
dormant
intellect
it
does
not
occur
to
inquire
why
or
what
they
believe
many
though
they
tried
could
not
do
so
in
any
satisfactory
way
this
being
the
case
it
causes
no
uneasiness
to
any
one
who
honestly
attempts
to
set
down
his
own
view
of
the
evidences
of
religion
that
at
first
sight
he
seems
to
be
but
one
among
many
who
are
all
in
opposition
to
each
other
but
however
that
may
be
he
brings
together
his
reasons
and
relies
on
them
because
they
are
his
own
and
this
is
his
primary
evidence
and
he
has
a
second
ground
of
evidence
in
the
testimony
of
those
who
agree
with
him
but
his
best
evidence
is
the
former
which
is
derived
from
his
own
thoughts
and
it
is
that
which
the
world
has
a
right
to
demand
of
him
and
therefore
his
true
sobriety
and
modesty
consists
not
in
claiming
for
his
conclusions
an
acceptance
or
a
scientific
approval
which
is
not
to
be
found
anywhere
but
in
stating
what
are
personally
his
own
grounds
for
his
belief
in
natural
and
revealed
religion
which
he
holds
to
be
so
sufficient
that
he
thinks
that
others
do
hold
them
implicitly
or
in
substance
or
would
hold
them
if
they
inquired
fairly
or
will
hold
if
they
listen
to
him
or
do
not
hold
from
impediments
invincible
or
not
as
it
may
be
into
which
he
has
no
call
to
inquire
however
his
own
business
is
to
speak
for
himself
he
uses
the
words
of
the
samaritans
to
their
countrywoman
when
our
lord
had
remained
with
them
for
two
days
now
we
believe
not
for
thy
saying
for
we
have
heard
him
ourselves
and
know
that
this
is
indeed
the
saviour
of
the
in
these
words
it
is
declared
both
that
the
gospel
revelation
is
divine
and
that
it
carries
with
it
the
evidence
of
its
divinity
and
this
is
of
course
the
matter
of
fact
however
these
two
attributes
need
not
have
been
united
a
revelation
might
have
been
really
given
yet
given
without
credentials
our
supreme
master
might
have
imparted
to
us
truths
which
nature
can
not
teach
us
without
telling
us
that
he
had
imparted
them
as
is
actually
the
case
now
as
regards
heathen
countries
into
which
portions
of
revealed
truth
overflow
and
penetrate
without
their
populations
knowing
whence
those
truths
came
but
the
very
idea
of
christianity
in
its
profession
and
history
is
something
more
than
this
it
is
a
revelatio
revelata
it
is
a
definite
message
from
god
to
man
distinctly
conveyed
by
his
chosen
instruments
and
to
be
received
as
such
a
message
and
therefore
to
be
positively
acknowledged
embraced
and
maintained
as
true
on
the
ground
of
its
being
divine
not
as
true
on
intrinsic
grounds
not
as
probably
true
or
partially
true
but
as
absolutely
certain
knowledge
certain
in
a
sense
in
which
nothing
else
can
be
certain
because
it
comes
from
him
who
neither
can
deceive
nor
be
deceived
and
the
whole
tenor
of
scripture
from
beginning
to
end
is
to
this
effect
the
matter
of
revelation
is
not
a
mere
collection
of
truths
not
a
philosophical
view
not
a
religious
sentiment
or
spirit
not
a
special
morality
out
upon
mankind
as
a
stream
might
pour
itself
into
the
sea
mixing
with
the
world
s
thought
modifying
purifying
invigorating
it
an
authoritative
teaching
which
bears
witness
to
itself
and
keeps
itself
together
as
one
in
contrast
to
the
assemblage
of
opinions
on
all
sides
of
it
and
speaks
to
all
men
as
being
ever
and
everywhere
one
and
the
same
and
claiming
to
be
received
intelligently
by
all
whom
it
addresses
as
one
doctrine
discipline
and
devotion
directly
given
from
above
in
consequence
the
exhibition
of
credentials
that
is
of
evidence
that
it
is
what
it
professes
to
be
is
essential
to
christianity
as
it
comes
to
us
for
we
are
not
left
at
liberty
to
pick
and
choose
out
of
its
contents
according
to
our
judgment
but
must
receive
it
all
as
we
find
it
if
we
accept
it
at
all
it
is
a
religion
in
addition
to
the
religion
of
nature
and
as
nature
has
an
intrinsic
claim
upon
us
to
be
obeyed
and
used
so
what
is
over
and
above
nature
or
supernatural
must
also
bring
with
it
valid
testimonials
of
its
right
to
demand
our
homage
next
as
to
its
relation
to
nature
as
i
have
said
christianity
is
simply
an
addition
to
it
it
does
not
supersede
or
contradict
it
it
recognizes
and
depends
on
it
and
that
of
necessity
for
how
possibly
can
it
prove
its
claims
except
by
an
appeal
to
what
men
have
already
be
it
ever
so
miraculous
it
can
not
dispense
with
nature
this
would
be
to
cut
the
ground
from
under
it
for
what
would
be
the
worth
of
evidences
in
favour
of
a
revelation
which
denied
the
authority
of
that
system
of
thought
and
those
courses
of
reasoning
out
of
which
those
evidences
necessarily
grew
and
in
agreement
with
this
obvious
conclusion
we
find
in
scripture
our
lord
and
his
apostles
always
treating
christianity
as
the
completion
and
supplement
of
natural
religion
and
of
previous
revelations
as
when
he
says
that
the
father
testified
of
him
that
not
to
know
him
was
not
to
know
the
father
and
as
paul
at
athens
appeals
to
the
unknown
god
and
says
that
he
that
made
the
world
now
declareth
to
all
men
to
do
penance
because
he
hath
appointed
a
day
to
judge
the
world
by
the
man
whom
he
hath
as
then
our
lord
and
his
apostles
appeal
to
the
god
of
nature
we
must
follow
them
in
that
appeal
and
to
do
this
with
the
better
effect
we
must
first
inquire
into
the
chief
doctrines
and
the
grounds
of
natural
religion
natural
religion
by
religion
i
mean
the
knowledge
of
god
of
his
will
and
of
our
duties
towards
him
and
there
are
three
main
channels
which
nature
furnishes
for
our
acquiring
this
knowledge
viz
our
own
minds
the
voice
of
mankind
and
the
course
of
the
world
that
is
of
human
life
and
human
affairs
the
informations
which
these
three
convey
to
us
teach
us
the
being
and
attributes
of
god
our
responsibility
to
him
our
dependence
on
him
our
prospect
of
reward
or
punishment
to
be
somehow
brought
about
according
as
we
obey
or
disobey
him
and
the
most
authoritative
of
these
three
means
of
knowledge
as
being
specially
our
own
is
our
own
mind
whose
informations
give
us
the
rule
by
which
we
test
interpret
and
correct
what
is
presented
to
us
for
belief
whether
by
the
universal
testimony
of
mankind
or
by
the
history
of
society
and
of
the
world
our
great
internal
teacher
of
religion
is
as
i
have
said
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
essay
our
conscience
conscience
is
a
personal
guide
and
i
use
it
because
i
must
use
myself
i
am
as
little
able
to
think
by
any
mind
but
my
own
as
to
breathe
with
another
s
lungs
conscience
is
nearer
to
me
than
any
other
means
of
knowledge
and
as
it
is
given
to
me
so
also
is
it
given
to
others
and
being
carried
about
by
every
individual
in
his
own
breast
and
requiring
nothing
besides
itself
it
is
thus
adapted
for
the
communication
to
each
separately
of
that
knowledge
which
is
most
momentous
to
him
individually
for
the
use
of
all
classes
and
conditions
of
men
for
high
and
low
young
and
old
men
and
women
independently
of
books
of
educated
reasoning
of
physical
knowledge
or
of
philosophy
conscience
too
teaches
us
not
only
that
god
is
but
what
he
is
it
provides
for
the
mind
a
real
image
of
him
as
a
medium
of
worship
it
gives
us
a
rule
of
right
and
wrong
as
being
his
rule
and
a
code
of
moral
duties
moreover
it
is
so
constituted
that
if
obeyed
it
becomes
clearer
in
its
injunctions
and
wider
in
their
range
and
corrects
and
completes
the
accidental
feebleness
of
its
initial
teachings
conscience
then
considered
as
our
guide
is
fully
furnished
for
its
office
i
say
all
this
without
entering
into
the
question
how
far
external
assistances
are
in
all
cases
necessary
to
the
action
of
the
mind
because
in
fact
man
does
not
live
in
isolation
but
is
everywhere
found
as
a
member
of
society
i
am
not
concerned
here
with
abstract
questions
now
conscience
suggests
to
us
many
things
about
that
master
whom
by
means
of
it
we
perceive
but
its
most
prominent
teaching
and
its
cardinal
and
distinguishing
truth
is
that
he
is
our
judge
in
consequence
the
special
attribute
under
which
it
brings
him
before
us
to
which
it
subordinates
all
other
attributes
is
that
of
justice
we
learn
from
its
informations
to
conceive
of
the
almighty
primarily
not
as
a
god
of
wisdom
of
knowledge
of
power
of
benevolence
but
as
a
god
of
judgment
and
justice
as
one
who
not
simply
for
the
good
of
the
offender
but
as
an
end
good
in
itself
and
as
a
principle
of
government
ordains
that
the
offender
should
suffer
for
his
offence
if
it
tells
us
anything
at
all
of
the
characteristics
of
the
divine
mind
it
certainly
tells
us
this
and
considering
that
our
shortcomings
are
far
more
frequent
and
important
than
our
fulfilment
of
the
duties
enjoined
upon
us
and
that
of
this
point
we
are
fully
aware
ourselves
it
follows
that
the
aspect
under
which
almighty
god
is
presented
to
us
by
nature
is
to
use
a
figure
of
one
who
is
angry
with
us
and
threatens
evil
hence
its
effect
is
to
burden
and
sadden
the
religious
mind
and
is
in
contrast
with
the
enjoyment
derivable
from
the
exercise
of
the
affections
and
from
the
perception
of
beauty
whether
in
the
material
universe
or
in
the
creations
of
the
intellect
this
is
that
fearful
antagonism
brought
out
with
such
reality
by
lucretius
when
he
speaks
so
dishonourably
of
what
he
considers
the
heavy
yoke
of
religion
and
the
æternas
pœnas
in
morte
timendum
and
on
the
other
hand
rejoices
in
his
alma
venus
quæ
rerum
naturam
sola
and
we
may
appeal
to
him
for
the
fact
while
we
repudiate
his
view
of
it
such
being
the
aspect
of
religion
which
the
teachings
of
conscience
bring
before
us
individually
in
the
next
place
let
us
consider
what
are
the
doctrines
and
what
the
influences
of
religion
as
we
find
it
embodied
in
those
various
rites
and
devotions
which
have
taken
root
in
the
many
races
of
mankind
since
the
beginning
of
history
and
before
history
all
over
the
earth
of
these
also
lucretius
gives
us
a
specimen
and
they
accord
in
form
and
complexion
with
that
doctrine
about
duty
and
responsibility
which
he
so
bitterly
hates
and
loathes
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
insist
that
wherever
religion
exists
in
a
popular
shape
it
has
almost
invariably
worn
its
dark
side
outwards
it
is
founded
in
one
way
or
other
on
the
sense
of
sin
and
without
that
vivid
sense
it
would
hardly
have
any
precepts
or
any
observances
its
many
varieties
all
proclaim
or
imply
that
man
is
in
a
degraded
servile
condition
and
requires
expiation
reconciliation
and
some
great
change
of
nature
this
is
suggested
to
us
in
the
many
ways
in
which
we
are
told
of
a
realm
of
light
and
a
realm
of
darkness
of
an
elect
fold
and
a
regenerate
state
it
is
suggested
in
the
almost
ubiquitous
and
institution
of
a
priesthood
for
wherever
there
is
a
priest
there
is
the
notion
of
sin
pollution
and
retribution
as
on
the
other
hand
of
intercession
and
mediation
also
still
more
directly
is
the
notion
of
our
guilt
impressed
upon
us
by
the
doctrine
of
future
punishment
and
that
eternal
which
is
found
in
mythologies
and
creeds
of
such
various
parentage
of
these
distinct
rites
and
doctrines
embodying
the
severe
side
of
natural
religion
the
most
remarkable
is
that
of
atonement
that
is
a
substitution
of
something
offered
or
some
personal
suffering
for
a
penalty
which
would
otherwise
be
exacted
most
remarkable
i
say
both
from
its
close
connexion
with
the
notion
of
vicarious
satisfaction
and
on
the
other
hand
from
its
universality
the
practice
of
atonement
says
the
author
whose
definition
of
the
word
i
have
just
given
is
remarkable
for
its
antiquity
and
universality
proved
by
the
earliest
records
that
have
come
down
to
us
of
all
nations
and
by
the
testimony
of
ancient
and
modern
travellers
in
the
oldest
books
of
the
hebrew
scriptures
we
have
numerous
instances
of
expiatory
rites
where
atonement
is
the
prominent
feature
at
the
earliest
date
to
which
we
can
carry
our
inquiries
by
means
of
the
heathen
records
we
meet
with
the
same
notion
of
atonement
if
we
pursue
our
inquiries
through
the
accounts
left
us
by
the
greek
and
roman
writers
of
the
barbarous
nations
with
which
they
were
acquainted
from
india
to
britain
we
shall
find
the
same
notions
and
similar
practices
of
atonement
from
the
most
popular
portion
of
our
own
literature
our
narratives
of
voyages
and
travels
every
one
probably
who
reads
at
all
will
be
able
to
find
for
himself
abundant
proof
that
the
notion
has
been
as
permanent
as
it
is
universal
it
shows
itself
among
the
various
tribes
of
africa
the
islanders
of
the
south
seas
and
even
that
most
peculiar
race
the
natives
of
australia
either
in
the
shape
of
some
offering
or
some
mutilation
of
the
person
these
ceremonial
acknowledgments
in
so
many
distinct
forms
of
worship
of
the
existing
degradation
of
the
human
race
of
course
imply
a
brighter
as
well
as
a
threatening
aspect
of
natural
religion
for
why
should
men
adopt
any
rites
of
deprecation
or
of
purification
at
all
unless
they
had
some
hope
of
attaining
to
a
better
condition
than
their
present
of
this
happier
side
of
religion
i
will
speak
presently
here
however
a
question
of
another
kind
occurs
viz
whether
the
notion
of
atonement
can
be
admitted
among
the
doctrines
of
natural
religion
mean
on
the
ground
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
those
teachings
of
conscience
which
i
have
recognized
above
as
the
rule
and
corrective
of
every
other
information
on
the
subject
if
there
is
any
truth
brought
home
to
us
by
conscience
it
is
this
that
we
are
personally
responsible
for
what
we
do
that
we
have
no
means
of
shifting
our
responsibility
and
that
dereliction
of
duty
involves
punishment
how
it
may
be
asked
can
acts
of
ours
of
any
can
even
amendment
of
the
past
and
if
even
our
own
subsequent
acts
of
obedience
bring
with
them
no
promise
of
reversing
what
has
once
been
committed
how
can
external
rites
or
the
actions
of
another
as
of
a
priest
be
substitutes
for
that
punishment
which
is
the
connatural
fruit
and
intrinsic
development
of
violation
of
the
sense
of
duty
i
think
this
objection
avails
as
far
as
this
that
amendment
is
no
reparation
and
that
no
ceremonies
or
penances
can
in
themselves
exercise
any
vicarious
virtue
in
our
behalf
and
that
if
they
avail
they
only
avail
in
the
intermediate
season
of
probation
that
in
some
way
we
must
make
them
our
own
and
that
when
the
time
comes
which
conscience
forebodes
of
our
being
called
to
judgment
then
at
least
we
shall
have
to
stand
in
and
by
ourselves
whatever
we
shall
have
by
that
time
become
and
must
bear
our
own
burden
but
it
is
plain
that
in
this
final
account
as
it
lies
between
us
and
our
master
he
alone
can
decide
how
the
past
and
the
present
will
stand
together
who
is
our
creator
and
our
judge
in
thus
making
it
a
necessary
point
to
adjust
the
religions
of
the
world
with
the
intimations
of
our
conscience
i
am
suggesting
the
reason
why
i
confine
myself
to
such
religions
as
have
had
their
rise
in
barbarous
times
and
do
not
recognize
the
religion
of
what
is
called
civilization
as
having
legitimately
a
part
in
the
delineation
of
natural
religion
it
may
at
first
sight
seem
strange
that
considering
i
have
laid
such
stress
upon
the
progressive
nature
of
man
i
should
take
my
ideas
of
his
religion
from
his
initial
and
not
his
final
testimony
about
its
doctrines
and
it
may
be
urged
that
the
religion
of
civilized
times
is
quite
opposite
in
character
to
the
rites
and
traditions
of
barbarians
and
has
nothing
of
that
gloom
and
sternness
on
which
i
have
insisted
as
their
characteristic
thus
the
greek
mythology
was
for
the
most
part
cheerful
and
graceful
and
the
new
gods
certainly
more
genial
and
indulgent
than
the
old
ones
and
in
like
manner
the
religion
of
philosophy
is
more
noble
and
more
humane
than
those
primitive
conceptions
which
were
sufficient
for
early
kings
and
warriors
but
my
answer
to
this
objection
is
obvious
the
progress
of
which
man
s
nature
is
capable
is
a
development
not
a
destruction
of
its
original
state
it
must
subserve
the
elements
from
which
it
proceeds
in
order
to
be
a
true
development
and
not
a
perversion
and
it
does
in
fact
subserve
and
complete
that
nature
with
which
man
is
born
it
is
otherwise
with
the
religion
of
civilization
such
religion
does
but
contradict
the
religion
of
barbarism
and
since
this
civilization
itself
is
not
a
development
of
man
s
whole
nature
but
mainly
of
the
intellect
recognizing
indeed
the
moral
sense
but
ignoring
the
conscience
no
wonder
that
the
religion
in
which
it
issues
has
no
sympathy
either
with
the
hopes
and
fears
of
the
awakened
soul
or
with
those
frightful
presentiments
which
are
expressed
in
the
worship
and
traditions
of
the
heathen
this
artificial
religion
then
has
no
place
in
the
inquiry
first
because
it
comes
of
a
progress
of
mind
and
next
for
the
very
reason
that
it
contradicts
informants
which
speak
with
greater
authority
than
itself
now
we
come
to
the
third
natural
informant
on
the
subject
of
religion
i
mean
the
system
and
the
course
of
the
world
this
established
order
of
things
in
which
we
find
ourselves
if
it
has
a
creator
must
surely
speak
of
his
will
in
its
broad
outlines
and
its
main
issues
this
principle
being
laid
down
as
certain
when
we
come
to
apply
it
to
things
as
they
are
our
first
feeling
is
one
of
surprise
and
i
may
say
of
dismay
that
his
control
of
the
world
is
so
indirect
and
his
action
so
obscure
this
is
the
first
lesson
that
we
gain
from
the
course
of
human
affairs
what
strikes
the
mind
so
forcibly
and
so
painfully
is
his
absence
if
i
may
so
speak
from
his
own
world
it
is
a
silence
that
speaks
it
is
as
if
others
had
got
possession
of
his
work
why
does
not
he
our
maker
and
ruler
give
us
some
immediate
knowledge
of
himself
why
does
he
not
write
his
moral
nature
in
large
letters
upon
the
face
of
history
and
bring
the
blind
tumultuous
rush
of
its
events
into
a
celestial
hierarchical
order
why
does
he
not
grant
us
in
the
structure
of
society
at
least
so
much
of
a
revelation
of
himself
as
the
religions
of
the
heathen
attempt
to
supply
why
from
the
beginning
of
time
has
no
one
uniform
steady
light
guided
all
families
of
the
earth
and
all
individual
men
how
to
please
him
why
is
it
possible
without
absurdity
to
deny
his
will
his
attributes
his
existence
why
does
he
not
walk
with
us
one
by
one
as
he
is
said
to
have
walked
with
his
chosen
men
of
old
time
we
both
see
and
know
each
other
why
if
we
can
not
have
the
sight
of
him
have
we
not
at
least
the
knowledge
on
the
contrary
he
is
specially
a
hidden
god
and
with
our
best
efforts
we
can
only
glean
from
the
surface
of
the
world
some
faint
and
fragmentary
views
of
him
i
see
only
a
choice
of
alternatives
in
explanation
of
so
critical
a
fact
there
is
no
creator
or
he
has
disowned
his
creatures
are
then
the
dim
shadows
of
his
presence
in
the
affairs
of
men
but
a
fancy
of
our
own
or
on
the
other
hand
has
he
hid
his
face
and
the
light
of
his
countenance
because
we
have
in
some
special
way
dishonoured
him
my
true
informant
my
burdened
conscience
gives
me
at
once
the
true
answer
to
each
of
these
antagonist
questions
pronounces
without
any
misgiving
that
god
exists
it
pronounces
quite
as
surely
that
i
am
alienated
from
him
that
his
hand
is
not
shortened
but
that
our
iniquities
have
divided
between
us
and
our
thus
it
solves
the
world
s
mystery
and
sees
in
that
mystery
only
a
confirmation
of
its
own
original
teaching
let
us
pass
on
to
another
great
fact
of
experience
bearing
on
religion
which
confirms
this
testimony
both
of
conscience
and
of
the
forms
of
worship
which
prevail
among
mankind
mean
the
amount
of
suffering
bodily
and
mental
which
is
our
portion
in
this
life
not
only
is
the
creator
far
off
but
some
being
of
malignant
nature
seems
as
i
have
said
to
have
got
hold
of
us
and
to
be
making
us
his
sport
let
us
say
there
are
a
thousand
millions
of
men
on
the
earth
at
this
time
who
can
weigh
and
measure
the
aggregate
of
pain
which
this
one
generation
has
endured
and
will
endure
from
birth
to
death
then
add
to
this
all
the
pain
which
has
fallen
and
will
fall
upon
our
race
through
centuries
past
and
to
come
is
there
not
then
some
great
gulf
fixed
between
us
and
the
good
god
here
again
the
testimony
of
the
system
of
nature
is
more
than
corroborated
by
those
popular
traditions
about
the
unseen
state
which
are
found
in
mythologies
and
superstitions
ancient
and
modern
for
those
traditions
speak
not
only
of
present
misery
but
of
pain
and
evil
hereafter
and
even
without
end
but
this
dreadful
addition
is
not
necessary
for
the
conclusion
which
i
am
here
wishing
to
draw
the
real
mystery
is
not
that
evil
should
never
have
an
end
but
that
it
should
ever
have
had
a
beginning
even
a
universal
restitution
could
not
undo
what
had
been
or
account
for
evil
being
the
necessary
condition
of
good
how
are
we
to
explain
it
the
existence
of
god
being
taken
for
granted
except
by
saying
that
another
will
besides
his
has
had
a
part
in
the
disposition
of
his
work
that
there
is
an
intractable
quarrel
a
chronic
alienation
between
god
and
man
i
have
implied
that
the
laws
on
which
this
world
is
governed
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
prove
that
evil
will
never
die
out
of
the
creation
nevertheless
they
look
in
that
direction
no
experience
indeed
of
life
can
assure
us
about
the
future
but
it
can
and
does
give
us
means
of
conjecturing
what
is
likely
to
be
and
those
conjectures
coincide
with
our
natural
forebodings
experience
enables
us
to
ascertain
the
moral
constitution
of
man
and
thereby
to
presage
his
future
from
his
present
it
teaches
us
first
that
he
is
not
sufficient
for
his
own
happiness
but
is
dependent
upon
the
sensible
objects
which
surround
him
and
that
these
he
can
not
take
with
him
when
he
leaves
the
world
secondly
that
disobedience
to
his
sense
of
right
is
even
by
itself
misery
and
that
he
carries
that
misery
about
him
wherever
he
is
though
no
divine
retribution
followed
upon
it
and
thirdly
that
he
can
not
change
his
nature
and
his
habits
by
wishing
but
is
simply
himself
and
will
ever
be
himself
and
what
he
now
is
wherever
he
is
as
long
as
he
continues
to
be
at
least
that
pain
has
no
natural
tendency
to
make
him
other
than
he
is
and
that
the
longer
he
lives
the
more
difficult
he
is
to
change
how
can
we
meet
these
not
irrational
anticipations
except
by
shutting
our
eyes
turning
away
from
them
and
saying
that
we
have
no
call
no
right
to
think
of
them
at
present
or
to
make
ourselves
miserable
about
what
is
not
certain
and
may
be
not
true
such
is
the
severe
aspect
of
natural
religion
also
it
is
the
most
prominent
aspect
because
the
multitude
of
men
follow
their
own
likings
and
wills
and
not
the
decisions
of
their
sense
of
right
and
wrong
to
them
religion
is
a
mere
yoke
as
lucretius
describes
it
not
a
satisfaction
or
refuge
but
a
terror
and
a
superstition
however
i
must
not
for
an
instant
be
supposed
to
mean
that
this
is
its
only
its
chief
or
its
legitimate
aspect
all
religion
so
far
as
it
is
genuine
is
a
blessing
natural
as
well
as
revealed
i
have
insisted
on
its
severe
aspect
in
the
first
place
because
from
the
circumstances
of
human
nature
though
not
by
the
fault
of
religion
such
is
the
shape
in
which
we
first
encounter
it
its
large
and
deep
foundation
is
the
sense
of
sin
and
guilt
and
without
this
sense
there
is
for
man
as
he
is
no
genuine
religion
otherwise
it
is
but
counterfeit
and
hollow
and
that
is
the
reason
why
this
religion
of
civilization
and
philosophy
is
so
great
a
mockery
however
true
as
this
judgment
is
which
i
pass
on
philosophical
religion
and
troubled
as
are
the
existing
relations
between
god
and
man
as
both
the
voice
of
mankind
and
the
facts
of
divine
government
testify
equally
true
are
other
general
laws
which
govern
those
relations
and
they
speak
another
language
and
compensate
for
what
is
stern
in
the
teaching
of
nature
without
tending
to
deny
that
sternness
the
first
of
these
laws
relieving
the
aspect
of
natural
religion
is
the
very
fact
that
religious
beliefs
and
institutions
of
some
kind
or
other
are
of
such
general
acceptance
in
all
times
and
places
why
should
men
subject
themselves
to
the
tyranny
which
lucretius
denounces
unless
they
had
either
experience
or
hope
of
benefits
to
themselves
by
so
doing
though
it
be
mere
hope
of
benefits
that
alone
is
a
great
alleviation
of
the
gloom
and
misery
which
their
religious
rites
presuppose
or
occasion
for
thereby
they
have
a
prospect
more
or
less
clear
of
some
happier
state
in
reserve
for
them
or
at
least
the
chances
of
it
if
they
simply
despaired
of
their
fortunes
they
would
not
care
about
religion
and
hope
of
future
good
as
we
know
sweetens
all
suffering
moreover
they
have
an
earnest
of
that
future
in
the
real
and
recurring
blessings
of
life
the
enjoyment
of
the
gifts
of
the
earth
and
of
domestic
affection
and
social
intercourse
which
is
sufficient
to
touch
and
to
subdue
even
the
most
guilty
of
men
in
his
better
moments
reminding
him
that
he
is
not
utterly
cast
off
by
him
whom
nevertheless
he
is
not
given
to
know
or
in
the
apostle
s
words
though
the
creator
once
suffered
all
nations
to
walk
in
their
own
ways
still
he
left
not
himself
without
testimony
doing
good
from
heaven
giving
rains
and
fruitful
seasons
filling
our
hearts
with
food
and
nor
are
these
blessings
of
physical
nature
the
only
tokens
in
the
divine
system
which
in
that
heathen
time
and
indeed
in
every
age
bring
home
to
our
experience
the
fact
of
a
good
god
in
spite
of
the
tumult
and
confusion
of
the
world
it
is
possible
to
give
an
interpretation
to
the
course
of
things
by
which
every
event
or
occurrence
in
its
order
becomes
providential
and
though
that
interpretation
does
not
hold
good
unless
the
world
is
contemplated
from
a
particular
point
of
view
in
one
given
aspect
and
with
certain
inward
experiences
and
personal
first
principles
and
judgments
yet
these
may
be
fairly
pronounced
to
be
common
conditions
of
human
thought
that
is
till
they
are
wilfully
or
accidentally
lost
and
they
issue
in
fact
in
leading
the
great
majority
of
men
to
recognize
the
hand
of
unseen
power
directing
in
mercy
or
in
judgment
the
physical
and
moral
system
in
the
prominent
events
of
the
world
past
and
contemporary
the
fate
evil
or
happy
of
great
men
the
rise
and
fall
of
states
popular
revolutions
decisive
battles
the
migration
of
races
the
replenishing
of
the
earth
earthquakes
and
pestilences
critical
discoveries
and
inventions
the
history
of
philosophy
the
advancement
of
knowledge
in
these
the
spontaneous
piety
of
the
human
mind
discerns
a
divine
supervision
nay
there
is
a
general
feeling
originating
directly
in
the
workings
of
conscience
that
a
similar
governance
is
extended
over
the
persons
of
individuals
who
thereby
both
fulfil
the
purposes
and
receive
the
just
recompenses
of
an
omnipotent
providence
good
to
the
good
and
evil
to
the
evil
is
instinctively
felt
to
be
even
from
what
we
see
amid
whatever
obscurity
and
confusion
the
universal
rule
of
god
s
dealings
with
us
hence
come
the
great
proverbs
indigenous
in
both
christian
and
heathen
nations
that
punishment
is
sure
though
slow
that
murder
will
out
that
treason
never
prospers
that
pride
will
have
a
fall
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
and
that
curses
fall
on
the
heads
of
those
who
utter
them
to
the
unsophisticated
apprehension
of
the
many
the
successive
passages
of
life
social
or
political
are
so
many
miracles
if
that
is
to
be
accounted
miraculous
which
brings
before
them
the
immediate
divine
presence
and
should
it
be
objected
that
this
is
an
illogical
exercise
of
reason
i
answer
that
since
it
actually
brings
them
to
a
right
conclusion
and
was
intended
to
bring
them
to
it
if
logic
finds
fault
with
it
so
much
the
worse
for
logic
again
prayer
is
essential
to
religion
and
where
prayer
is
there
is
a
natural
relief
and
solace
in
all
trouble
great
or
ordinary
now
prayer
is
not
less
general
in
mankind
at
large
than
is
faith
in
providence
it
has
ever
been
in
use
both
as
a
personal
and
as
a
social
practice
here
again
if
in
order
to
determine
what
the
religion
of
nature
is
we
may
justly
have
recourse
to
the
spontaneous
acts
and
proceedings
of
our
race
as
viewed
on
a
large
field
we
may
safely
say
that
prayer
as
well
as
hope
is
a
constituent
of
man
s
religion
nor
is
it
a
fair
objection
to
this
argument
to
say
that
such
prayers
and
rites
as
have
obtained
in
various
places
and
times
are
in
their
character
object
and
scope
inconsistent
with
each
other
because
their
contrarieties
do
not
come
into
the
idea
of
religion
as
such
at
all
and
the
very
fact
of
their
discordance
destroys
their
right
to
be
taken
into
account
so
far
as
they
are
discordant
for
what
is
not
universal
has
no
claim
to
be
considered
natural
right
or
of
divine
origin
thus
we
may
determine
prayer
to
be
part
of
natural
religion
from
such
instances
of
the
usage
as
are
supplied
by
the
priests
of
baal
and
by
dancing
dervishes
without
therefore
including
in
our
notions
of
prayer
the
frantic
excesses
of
the
one
or
the
artistic
spinning
of
the
other
or
sanctioning
their
respective
objects
of
belief
baal
or
mahomet
as
prayer
is
the
voice
of
man
to
god
so
revelation
is
the
voice
of
god
to
man
accordingly
it
is
another
alleviation
of
the
darkness
and
distress
which
weigh
upon
the
religions
of
the
world
that
in
one
way
or
other
such
religions
are
founded
on
some
idea
of
express
revelation
coming
from
the
unseen
agents
whose
anger
they
deprecate
nay
that
the
very
rites
and
observances
by
which
they
hope
to
gain
the
favour
of
these
beings
are
by
these
beings
themselves
communicated
and
appointed
the
religion
of
nature
is
not
a
deduction
of
reason
or
the
joint
voluntary
manifesto
of
a
multitude
meeting
together
and
pledging
themselves
to
each
other
as
men
move
resolutions
now
for
some
political
or
social
purpose
but
it
is
a
tradition
or
an
interposition
vouchsafed
to
a
people
from
above
to
such
an
interposition
men
even
ascribed
their
civil
polity
or
citizenship
which
did
not
originate
in
any
plebiscite
but
in
or
heroes
was
inaugurated
with
portents
or
palladia
and
protected
and
prospered
by
oracles
and
auguries
here
is
an
evidence
too
how
congenial
the
notion
of
a
revelation
is
to
the
human
mind
so
that
the
expectation
of
it
may
truly
be
considered
an
integral
part
of
natural
religion
among
the
observances
imposed
by
these
professed
revelations
none
is
more
remarkable
or
more
general
than
the
rite
of
sacrifice
in
which
guilt
was
removed
or
blessing
gained
by
an
offering
which
availed
instead
of
the
merits
of
the
offerer
this
too
as
well
as
the
notion
of
divine
interpositions
may
be
considered
almost
an
integral
part
of
the
religion
of
nature
and
an
alleviation
of
its
gloom
but
it
does
not
stand
by
itself
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
doctrine
of
atonement
under
which
it
falls
and
which
if
what
is
universal
is
natural
enters
into
the
idea
of
religious
service
and
what
the
nature
of
man
suggests
the
providential
system
of
the
world
sanctions
by
enforcing
it
is
the
law
or
the
permission
given
to
our
whole
race
to
use
the
apostle
s
words
to
bear
one
another
s
burdens
and
this
as
i
said
when
on
the
subject
of
atonement
is
quite
consistent
with
his
antithesis
that
every
one
must
bear
his
own
the
final
burden
of
responsibility
when
we
are
called
to
judgment
is
our
own
but
among
the
media
by
which
we
are
prepared
for
that
judgment
are
the
exertions
and
pains
taken
in
our
behalf
by
others
on
this
vicarious
principle
by
which
we
appropriate
to
ourselves
what
others
do
for
us
the
whole
structure
of
society
is
raised
parents
work
and
endure
pain
that
their
children
may
prosper
children
suffer
for
the
sin
of
their
parents
who
have
died
before
it
bore
fruit
delirant
reges
plectuntur
sometimes
it
is
a
compulsory
sometimes
a
willing
mediation
the
punishment
which
is
earned
by
the
husband
falls
upon
the
wife
the
benefits
in
which
all
classes
partake
are
wrought
out
by
the
unhealthy
or
dangerous
toil
of
the
few
soldiers
endure
wounds
and
death
for
those
who
sit
at
home
and
ministers
of
state
fall
victims
to
their
zeal
for
their
countrymen
who
do
little
else
than
criticize
their
actions
and
so
in
some
measure
or
way
this
law
embraces
all
of
us
we
all
suffer
for
each
other
and
gain
by
each
other
s
sufferings
for
man
never
stands
alone
here
though
he
will
stand
by
himself
one
day
hereafter
but
here
he
is
a
social
being
and
goes
forward
to
his
long
home
as
one
of
a
large
company
butler
it
need
scarcely
be
said
is
the
great
master
of
this
doctrine
as
it
is
brought
out
in
the
system
of
nature
in
answer
to
the
objection
to
the
christian
doctrine
of
satisfaction
that
it
represents
god
as
indifferent
whether
he
punishes
the
innocent
or
the
guilty
he
observes
that
the
world
is
a
constitution
or
system
whose
parts
have
a
mutual
reference
to
each
other
and
that
there
is
a
scheme
of
things
gradually
carrying
on
called
the
course
of
nature
to
the
carrying
on
of
which
god
has
appointed
us
in
various
ways
to
contribute
and
in
the
daily
course
of
natural
providence
it
is
appointed
that
innocent
people
should
suffer
for
the
faults
of
the
guilty
finally
indeed
and
upon
the
whole
every
one
shall
receive
according
to
his
personal
deserts
but
during
the
progress
and
for
aught
we
know
even
in
order
to
the
completion
of
this
moral
scheme
vicarious
punishments
may
be
fit
and
absolutely
necessary
we
see
in
what
variety
of
ways
one
person
s
sufferings
contribute
to
the
relief
of
another
and
being
familiarized
to
it
men
are
not
shocked
with
it
so
the
reason
of
their
insisting
on
objections
against
the
doctrine
of
satisfaction
is
either
that
they
do
not
consider
god
s
settled
and
uniform
appointments
as
his
appointments
at
all
or
else
they
forget
that
vicarious
punishment
is
a
providential
appointment
of
every
day
s
experience
i
will
but
add
that
since
all
human
suffering
is
in
its
last
resolution
the
punishment
of
sin
and
punishment
implies
a
judge
and
a
rule
of
justice
he
who
undergoes
the
punishment
of
another
in
his
stead
may
be
said
in
a
certain
sense
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
justice
towards
that
other
in
his
own
person
one
concluding
remark
has
to
be
made
here
in
all
sacrifices
it
was
specially
required
that
the
thing
offered
should
be
something
rare
and
unblemished
and
in
like
manner
in
all
atonements
and
all
satisfactions
not
only
was
the
innocent
taken
for
the
guilty
but
it
was
a
point
of
special
importance
that
the
victim
should
be
spotless
and
the
more
manifest
that
spotlessness
the
more
efficacious
was
the
sacrifice
this
leads
me
to
a
last
principle
which
i
shall
notice
as
proper
to
natural
religion
and
as
lightening
the
prophecies
of
evil
in
which
it
is
founded
i
mean
the
doctrine
of
meritorious
intercession
the
man
in
the
gospel
did
but
speak
for
the
human
race
everywhere
when
he
said
god
heareth
not
sinners
but
if
a
man
be
a
worshipper
of
god
and
doth
his
will
him
he
hence
every
religion
has
had
its
eminent
devotees
exalted
above
the
body
of
the
people
mortified
men
brought
nearer
to
the
source
of
good
by
austerities
and
prayer
who
have
influence
with
him
and
extend
a
shelter
and
gain
blessings
for
those
who
become
their
clients
a
belief
like
this
has
been
of
course
attended
by
numberless
superstitions
but
those
superstitions
vary
with
times
and
places
and
the
belief
itself
in
the
mediatorial
power
of
the
good
and
holy
has
been
one
and
the
same
everywhere
nor
is
this
belief
an
idea
of
past
times
only
or
of
heathen
countries
it
is
one
of
the
most
natural
visions
of
the
young
and
innocent
and
all
of
us
the
more
keenly
we
feel
our
own
distance
from
holy
persons
the
more
are
we
drawn
near
to
them
as
if
forgetting
that
distance
and
proud
of
them
because
they
are
so
unlike
ourselves
as
being
specimens
of
what
our
nature
may
be
and
with
some
vague
hope
that
we
their
relations
by
blood
may
profit
in
our
own
persons
by
their
holiness
such
then
in
outline
is
that
system
of
natural
beliefs
and
sentiments
which
though
true
and
divine
is
still
possible
to
us
independently
of
revelation
and
is
the
preparation
for
it
though
in
christians
themselves
it
can
not
really
be
separated
from
their
christianity
and
never
is
possessed
in
its
higher
forms
in
any
people
without
some
portion
of
those
inward
aids
which
christianity
imparts
to
us
and
those
endemic
traditions
which
have
their
first
origin
in
a
paradisiacal
illumination
revealed
religion
in
determining
as
above
the
main
features
of
natural
religion
and
distinguishing
it
from
the
religion
of
philosophy
or
civilization
i
may
be
accused
of
having
taken
a
course
of
my
own
for
which
i
have
no
sufficient
warrant
such
an
accusation
does
not
give
me
much
concern
every
one
who
thinks
on
these
subjects
takes
a
course
of
his
own
though
it
will
also
happen
to
be
the
course
which
others
take
besides
himself
the
minds
of
many
separately
bear
them
forward
in
the
same
direction
and
they
are
confirmed
in
it
by
each
other
this
i
consider
to
be
my
own
case
if
i
have
or
omitted
notorious
facts
in
my
account
of
natural
religion
if
i
have
contradicted
or
disregarded
anything
which
he
who
speaks
through
my
conscience
has
told
us
all
directly
from
heaven
then
indeed
i
have
acted
unjustifiably
and
have
something
to
unsay
but
if
i
have
done
no
more
than
view
the
notorious
facts
of
the
case
in
the
medium
of
my
primary
mental
experiences
under
the
aspects
which
they
spontaneously
present
to
me
and
with
the
aid
of
my
best
illative
sense
i
only
do
on
one
side
of
the
question
what
those
who
think
differently
do
on
the
other
as
they
start
with
one
set
of
first
principles
i
start
with
another
i
gave
notice
just
now
that
i
should
offer
my
own
witness
in
the
matter
in
question
though
of
course
it
would
not
be
worth
while
my
offering
it
unless
what
i
felt
myself
agreed
with
what
is
felt
by
hundreds
and
thousands
besides
me
as
i
am
sure
it
does
whatever
be
the
measure
more
or
less
of
their
explicit
recognition
of
it
in
thus
speaking
of
natural
religion
as
in
one
sense
a
matter
of
private
judgment
and
that
with
a
view
of
proceeding
from
it
to
the
proof
of
christianity
i
seem
to
give
up
the
intention
of
demonstrating
either
certainly
i
do
not
that
i
deny
that
demonstration
is
possible
truth
certainly
as
such
rests
upon
grounds
intrinsically
and
objectively
and
abstractedly
demonstrative
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
the
arguments
producible
in
its
favour
are
unanswerable
and
irresistible
these
latter
epithets
are
relative
and
bear
upon
matters
of
fact
arguments
in
themselves
ought
to
do
what
perhaps
in
the
particular
case
they
can
not
do
the
fact
of
revelation
is
in
itself
demonstrably
true
but
it
is
not
therefore
true
irresistibly
else
how
comes
it
to
be
resisted
there
is
a
vast
distance
between
what
it
is
in
itself
and
what
it
is
to
us
light
is
a
quality
of
matter
as
truth
is
of
christianity
but
light
is
not
recognized
by
the
blind
and
there
are
those
who
do
not
recognize
truth
from
the
fault
not
of
truth
but
of
themselves
i
can
not
convert
men
when
i
ask
for
assumptions
which
they
refuse
to
grant
to
me
and
without
assumptions
no
one
can
prove
anything
about
anything
i
am
suspicious
then
of
scientific
demonstrations
in
a
question
of
concrete
fact
in
a
discussion
between
fallible
men
however
let
those
demonstrate
who
have
the
gift
unusquisque
in
suo
sensu
for
me
it
is
more
congenial
to
my
own
judgment
to
attempt
to
prove
christianity
in
the
same
informal
way
in
which
i
can
prove
for
certain
that
i
have
been
born
into
this
world
and
that
i
shall
die
out
of
it
it
is
pleasant
to
my
own
feelings
to
follow
a
theological
writer
such
as
amort
who
has
dedicated
to
the
great
pope
benedict
what
he
calls
a
new
modest
and
easy
way
of
demonstrating
the
catholic
in
this
work
he
adopts
the
argument
merely
of
the
probability
i
prefer
to
rely
on
that
of
an
of
various
probabilities
but
we
both
hold
that
is
i
hold
with
him
that
from
probabilities
we
may
construct
legitimate
proof
sufficient
for
certitude
i
follow
him
in
holding
that
since
a
good
providence
watches
over
us
he
blesses
such
means
of
argument
as
it
has
pleased
him
to
give
us
in
the
nature
of
man
and
of
the
world
if
we
use
them
duly
for
those
ends
for
which
he
has
given
them
and
that
as
in
mathematics
we
are
justified
by
the
dictate
of
nature
in
withholding
our
assent
from
a
conclusion
of
which
we
have
not
yet
a
strict
logical
demonstration
so
by
a
like
dictate
we
are
not
justified
in
the
case
of
concrete
reasoning
and
especially
of
religious
inquiry
in
waiting
till
such
logical
demonstration
is
ours
but
on
the
contrary
are
bound
in
conscience
to
seek
truth
and
to
look
for
certainty
by
modes
of
proof
which
when
reduced
to
the
shape
of
formal
propositions
fail
to
satisfy
the
severe
requisitions
of
science
here
then
at
once
is
one
momentous
doctrine
or
principle
which
enters
into
my
own
reasoning
and
which
another
ignores
viz
the
providence
and
intention
of
god
and
of
course
there
are
other
principles
explicit
or
implicit
which
are
in
like
circumstances
it
is
not
wonderful
then
that
while
i
can
prove
christianity
divine
to
my
own
satisfaction
i
shall
not
be
able
to
force
it
upon
any
one
else
multitudes
indeed
i
ought
to
succeed
in
persuading
of
its
truth
without
any
force
at
all
because
they
and
i
start
from
the
same
principles
and
what
is
a
proof
to
me
is
a
proof
to
them
but
if
any
one
starts
from
any
other
principles
but
ours
i
have
not
the
power
to
change
his
principles
or
the
conclusion
which
he
draws
from
them
any
more
than
i
can
make
a
crooked
man
straight
whether
his
mind
will
ever
grow
straight
whether
i
can
do
anything
towards
its
becoming
straight
whether
he
is
not
responsible
responsible
to
his
maker
for
being
mentally
crooked
is
another
matter
still
the
fact
remains
that
in
any
inquiry
about
things
in
the
concrete
men
differ
from
each
other
not
so
much
in
the
soundness
of
their
reasoning
as
in
the
principles
which
govern
its
exercise
that
those
principles
are
of
a
personal
character
that
where
there
is
no
common
measure
of
minds
there
is
no
common
measure
of
arguments
and
that
the
validity
of
proof
is
determined
not
by
any
scientific
test
but
by
the
illative
sense
accordingly
instead
of
saying
that
the
truths
of
revelation
depend
on
those
of
natural
religion
it
is
more
pertinent
to
say
that
belief
in
revealed
truths
depends
on
belief
in
natural
belief
is
a
state
of
mind
belief
generates
belief
states
of
mind
correspond
to
each
other
the
habits
of
thought
and
the
reasonings
which
lead
us
on
to
a
higher
state
of
belief
than
our
present
are
the
very
same
which
we
already
possess
in
connexion
with
the
lower
state
those
jews
became
christians
in
apostolic
times
who
were
already
what
may
be
called
and
those
christians
in
this
day
remain
christian
only
in
name
and
if
it
so
happen
at
length
fall
away
who
are
nothing
deeper
or
better
than
men
of
the
world
literary
men
or
politicians
that
a
special
preparation
of
mind
is
required
for
each
separate
department
of
inquiry
and
discussion
excepting
of
course
that
of
abstract
science
is
strongly
insisted
upon
in
passages
of
the
nicomachean
ethics
speaking
of
the
variations
which
are
found
in
the
logical
perfection
of
proof
in
various
aristotle
says
a
man
will
expect
exactness
in
every
class
of
subjects
according
as
the
nature
of
the
thing
admits
for
it
is
much
the
same
mistake
to
put
up
with
a
mathematician
using
probabilities
and
to
require
demonstration
of
an
orator
each
man
judges
skilfully
in
those
things
about
which
he
is
it
is
of
these
that
he
is
a
good
judge
viz
he
in
each
is
a
judge
who
is
in
that
and
he
is
in
an
absolute
sense
a
judge
who
is
in
all
of
them
again
young
men
come
to
be
mathematicians
and
the
like
but
they
can
not
possess
practical
judgment
for
this
talent
is
employed
upon
individual
facts
and
these
are
learned
only
by
experience
and
a
youth
has
not
experience
for
experience
is
only
gained
by
a
course
of
years
and
so
again
it
would
appear
that
a
boy
may
be
a
mathematician
but
not
a
philosopher
or
learned
in
physics
and
for
this
reason
the
one
study
deals
with
abstractions
while
the
other
studies
gain
their
principles
from
experience
and
in
the
latter
subjects
youths
do
not
give
assent
but
make
assertions
but
in
the
former
they
know
what
it
is
that
they
are
these
words
of
a
heathen
philosopher
laying
down
broad
principles
about
all
knowledge
express
a
general
rule
which
in
scripture
is
applied
authoritatively
to
the
case
of
revealed
knowledge
in
particular
that
not
once
or
twice
only
but
continually
as
is
notorious
for
instance
i
have
understood
says
the
psalmist
more
than
all
my
teachers
because
thy
testimonies
are
my
and
so
our
lord
he
that
hath
ears
let
him
if
any
man
will
do
his
will
he
shall
know
of
the
and
he
that
is
of
god
heareth
the
words
of
thus
too
the
angels
at
the
nativity
announce
peace
to
men
of
good
and
we
read
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
of
lydia
whose
heart
the
lord
opened
to
attend
to
those
things
which
were
said
by
and
we
are
told
on
another
occasion
that
as
many
as
were
ordained
or
disposed
by
god
to
life
everlasting
and
john
tells
us
he
that
knoweth
god
heareth
us
he
that
is
not
of
god
heareth
us
not
by
this
we
know
the
spirit
of
truth
and
the
spirit
of
relying
then
on
these
authorities
human
and
divine
i
have
no
scruple
in
beginning
the
review
i
shall
take
of
christianity
by
professing
to
consult
for
those
only
whose
minds
are
properly
prepared
for
it
and
by
being
prepared
i
mean
to
denote
those
who
are
imbued
with
the
religious
opinions
and
sentiments
which
i
have
identified
with
natural
religion
i
do
not
address
myself
to
those
who
in
moral
evil
and
physical
see
nothing
more
than
imperfections
of
a
parallel
nature
who
consider
that
the
difference
in
gravity
between
the
two
is
one
of
degree
only
not
of
kind
that
moral
evil
is
merely
the
offspring
of
physical
and
that
as
we
remove
the
latter
so
we
inevitably
remove
the
former
that
there
is
a
progress
of
the
human
race
which
tends
to
the
annihilation
of
moral
evil
that
knowledge
is
virtue
and
vice
is
ignorance
that
sin
is
a
bugbear
not
a
reality
that
the
creator
does
not
punish
except
in
the
sense
of
correcting
that
vengeance
in
him
would
of
necessity
be
vindictiveness
that
all
that
we
know
of
him
be
it
much
or
little
is
through
the
laws
of
nature
that
miracles
are
impossible
that
prayer
to
him
is
a
superstition
that
the
fear
of
him
is
unmanly
that
sorrow
for
sin
is
slavish
and
abject
that
the
only
intelligible
worship
of
him
is
to
act
well
our
part
in
the
world
and
the
only
sensible
repentance
to
do
better
in
future
that
if
we
do
our
duties
in
this
life
we
may
take
our
chance
for
the
next
and
that
it
is
of
no
use
perplexing
our
minds
about
the
future
state
for
it
is
all
a
matter
of
guess
these
opinions
characterize
a
civilized
age
and
if
i
say
that
i
will
not
argue
about
christianity
with
men
who
hold
them
i
do
so
not
as
claiming
any
right
to
be
impatient
or
peremptory
with
any
one
but
because
it
is
plainly
absurd
to
attempt
to
prove
a
second
proposition
to
those
who
do
not
admit
the
first
i
assume
then
that
the
above
system
of
opinion
is
simply
false
inasmuch
as
it
contradicts
the
primary
teachings
of
nature
in
the
human
race
wherever
a
religion
is
found
and
its
workings
can
be
ascertained
i
assume
the
presence
of
god
in
our
conscience
and
the
universal
experience
as
keen
as
our
experience
of
bodily
pain
of
what
we
call
a
sense
of
sin
or
guilt
this
sense
of
sin
as
of
something
not
only
evil
in
itself
but
an
affront
to
the
good
god
is
chiefly
felt
as
regards
one
or
other
of
three
violations
of
his
law
he
himself
is
sanctity
truth
and
love
and
the
three
offences
against
his
majesty
are
impurity
inveracity
and
cruelty
all
men
are
not
distressed
at
these
offences
alike
but
the
piercing
pain
and
sharp
remorse
which
one
or
other
inflicts
upon
the
mind
till
habituated
to
them
brings
home
to
it
the
notion
of
what
sin
is
and
is
the
vivid
type
and
representative
of
its
intrinsic
hatefulness
starting
from
these
elements
we
may
determine
without
difficulty
the
class
of
sentiments
intellectual
and
moral
which
constitute
the
formal
preparation
for
entering
upon
what
are
called
the
evidences
of
christianity
these
evidences
then
presuppose
a
belief
and
perception
of
the
divine
presence
a
recognition
of
his
attributes
and
an
admiration
of
his
person
viewed
under
them
a
conviction
of
the
worth
of
the
soul
and
of
the
reality
and
momentousness
of
the
unseen
world
an
understanding
that
in
proportion
as
we
partake
in
our
own
persons
of
the
attributes
which
we
admire
in
him
we
are
dear
to
him
a
consciousness
on
the
contrary
that
we
are
far
from
partaking
them
a
consequent
insight
into
our
guilt
and
misery
an
eager
hope
of
reconciliation
to
him
a
desire
to
know
and
to
love
him
and
a
sensitive
in
all
that
happens
whether
in
the
course
of
nature
or
of
human
life
for
tokens
if
such
there
be
of
his
bestowing
on
us
what
we
so
greatly
need
these
are
specimens
of
the
state
of
mind
for
which
i
stipulate
in
those
who
would
inquire
into
the
truth
of
christianity
and
my
warrant
for
so
definite
a
stipulation
lies
in
the
teaching
as
i
have
described
it
of
conscience
and
the
moral
sense
in
the
testimony
of
those
religious
rites
which
have
ever
prevailed
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
in
the
character
and
conduct
of
those
who
have
commonly
been
selected
by
the
popular
instinct
as
the
special
favourites
of
heaven
i
have
appealed
to
the
popular
ideas
on
the
subject
of
religion
and
to
the
objects
of
popular
admiration
and
praise
as
illustrating
my
account
of
the
preparation
of
mind
which
is
necessary
for
the
inquirer
into
christianity
here
an
obvious
objection
occurs
in
noticing
which
i
shall
be
advanced
one
step
farther
in
the
work
which
i
have
undertaken
it
may
be
urged
then
that
no
appeal
will
avail
me
which
is
made
to
religions
so
notoriously
immoral
as
those
of
paganism
nor
indeed
can
it
be
made
without
an
explanation
certainly
as
regards
ethical
teaching
various
religions
which
have
been
popular
in
the
world
have
not
supplied
any
and
in
the
corrupt
state
in
which
they
appear
in
history
they
are
little
better
than
schools
of
imposture
cruelty
and
impurity
their
objects
of
worship
were
immoral
as
well
as
false
and
their
founders
and
heroes
have
been
in
keeping
with
their
gods
this
is
undeniable
but
it
does
not
destroy
the
use
that
may
be
made
of
their
testimony
there
is
a
better
side
of
their
teaching
purity
has
often
been
held
in
reverence
if
not
practised
ascetics
have
been
in
honour
hospitality
has
been
a
sacred
duty
and
dishonesty
and
injustice
have
been
under
a
ban
here
then
as
before
i
take
our
natural
perception
of
right
and
wrong
as
the
standard
for
determining
the
characteristics
of
natural
religion
and
i
use
the
religious
rites
and
traditions
which
are
actually
found
in
the
world
only
so
far
as
they
agree
with
our
moral
sense
this
leads
me
to
lay
down
the
general
principle
which
i
have
all
along
implied
no
religion
is
from
god
which
contradicts
our
sense
of
right
and
wrong
doubtless
but
at
the
same
time
we
ought
to
be
quite
sure
that
in
a
particular
case
which
is
before
us
we
have
satisfactorily
ascertained
what
the
dictates
of
our
moral
nature
are
and
that
we
apply
them
rightly
and
whether
the
applying
them
or
not
comes
into
question
at
all
the
precepts
of
a
religion
certainly
may
be
absolutely
immoral
a
religion
which
simply
commanded
us
to
lie
or
to
have
a
community
of
wives
would
forfeit
all
claim
to
a
divine
origin
jupiter
and
neptune
as
represented
in
the
classical
mythology
are
evil
spirits
and
nothing
can
make
them
otherwise
and
i
should
in
like
manner
repudiate
a
theology
which
taught
that
men
were
created
in
order
to
be
wicked
and
wretched
i
alluded
just
now
to
those
who
consider
the
doctrine
of
retributive
punishment
or
of
divine
vengeance
to
be
incompatible
with
the
true
religion
but
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
maintain
their
ground
in
order
to
do
so
they
have
first
to
prove
that
an
act
of
vengeance
must
as
such
be
a
sin
in
our
own
instance
but
even
this
is
far
from
clear
anger
and
indignation
against
cruelty
and
injustice
resentment
of
injuries
desire
that
the
false
the
ungrateful
and
the
depraved
should
meet
with
punishment
these
if
not
in
themselves
virtuous
feelings
are
at
least
not
vicious
but
first
from
the
certainty
that
if
habitual
it
will
run
into
excess
and
become
sin
and
next
because
the
office
of
punishment
has
not
been
committed
to
us
and
further
because
it
is
a
feeling
unsuitable
to
those
who
are
themselves
so
laden
with
imperfection
and
guilt
therefore
vengeance
in
itself
allowable
is
forbidden
to
us
these
exceptions
do
not
hold
in
the
case
of
a
perfect
being
and
certainly
not
in
the
instance
of
the
supreme
judge
moreover
we
see
that
even
men
on
earth
have
different
duties
according
to
their
personal
qualifications
and
their
positions
in
the
community
the
rule
of
morals
is
the
same
for
all
and
yet
notwithstanding
what
is
right
in
one
is
not
necessarily
right
in
another
what
would
be
a
crime
in
a
private
man
to
do
is
a
crime
in
a
magistrate
not
to
have
done
still
wider
is
the
difference
between
man
and
his
maker
nor
must
it
be
forgotten
that
as
i
have
observed
above
retributive
justice
is
the
very
attribute
under
which
god
is
primarily
brought
before
us
in
the
teachings
of
our
natural
conscience
and
further
we
can
not
determine
the
character
of
particular
actions
till
we
have
the
whole
case
before
us
out
of
which
they
arise
unless
indeed
they
are
in
themselves
distinctively
vicious
we
all
feel
the
force
of
the
maxim
audi
alteram
it
is
difficult
to
trace
the
path
and
to
determine
the
scope
of
divine
providence
we
read
of
a
day
when
the
almighty
will
condescend
to
place
his
actions
in
their
completeness
before
his
creatures
and
will
overcome
when
he
is
if
till
then
we
feel
it
to
be
a
duty
to
suspend
our
judgment
concerning
certain
of
his
actions
or
precepts
we
do
no
more
than
what
we
do
every
day
in
the
case
of
an
earthly
friend
or
enemy
whose
conduct
in
some
point
requires
explanation
it
surely
is
not
too
much
to
expect
of
us
that
we
should
act
with
parallel
caution
and
be
memores
conditionis
nostræ
as
regards
the
acts
of
our
creator
there
is
a
poem
of
parnell
s
which
strikingly
brings
home
to
us
how
differently
the
divine
appointments
will
look
in
the
light
of
day
from
what
they
appear
to
be
in
our
present
twilight
an
angel
in
disguise
of
a
man
steals
a
golden
cup
strangles
an
infant
and
throws
a
guide
into
the
stream
and
then
explains
to
his
horrified
companion
that
acts
which
would
be
enormities
in
man
are
in
him
as
god
s
minister
deeds
of
merciful
correction
or
of
retribution
moreover
when
we
are
about
to
pass
judgment
on
the
dealings
of
providence
with
other
men
we
shall
do
well
to
consider
first
his
dealings
with
ourselves
we
can
not
know
about
others
about
ourselves
we
do
know
something
and
we
know
that
he
has
ever
been
good
to
us
and
not
severe
is
it
not
wise
to
argue
from
what
we
actually
know
to
what
we
do
not
know
it
may
turn
out
in
the
day
of
account
that
unforgiven
souls
while
charging
his
laws
with
injustice
in
the
case
of
others
may
be
unable
to
find
fault
with
his
dealings
severally
towards
themselves
as
to
those
various
religions
which
together
with
christianity
teach
the
doctrine
of
eternal
punishment
here
again
we
ought
before
we
judge
to
understand
not
only
the
whole
state
of
the
case
but
what
is
meant
by
the
doctrine
itself
eternity
or
endlessness
is
in
itself
only
a
negative
idea
though
punishment
is
positive
its
fearful
force
as
added
to
punishment
lies
in
what
it
is
not
it
means
no
change
of
state
no
annihilation
no
restoration
but
it
can
not
become
a
quality
of
punishment
any
more
than
a
man
s
living
seventy
years
is
a
quality
of
his
mind
or
enters
into
the
idea
of
his
virtues
or
talents
if
punishment
be
attended
by
continuity
by
a
sense
of
duration
and
succession
by
the
mental
presence
of
its
past
and
its
future
by
a
sustained
power
of
realizing
it
this
must
be
because
it
is
endless
and
something
more
such
inflictions
are
an
addition
to
its
endlessness
and
do
not
necessarily
belong
to
it
because
it
is
endless
as
i
have
already
said
the
great
mystery
is
not
that
evil
has
no
end
but
that
it
had
a
beginning
but
i
submit
the
whole
subject
to
the
theological
school
one
of
the
most
important
effects
of
natural
religion
on
the
mind
in
preparation
for
revealed
is
the
anticipation
which
it
creates
that
a
revelation
will
be
given
that
earnest
desire
of
it
which
religious
minds
cherish
leads
the
way
to
the
expectation
of
it
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
wounds
of
the
soul
are
not
led
to
deal
with
the
question
or
to
consider
its
circumstances
but
when
our
attention
is
roused
then
the
more
steadily
we
dwell
upon
it
the
more
probable
does
it
seem
that
a
revelation
has
been
or
will
be
given
to
us
this
presentiment
is
founded
on
our
sense
on
the
one
hand
of
the
infinite
goodness
of
god
and
on
the
other
of
our
own
extreme
misery
and
doctrines
which
are
the
primary
constituents
of
natural
religion
it
is
difficult
to
put
a
limit
to
the
legitimate
force
of
this
antecedent
probability
some
minds
will
feel
it
so
powerfully
as
to
recognize
in
it
almost
a
proof
without
direct
evidence
of
the
divinity
of
a
religion
claiming
to
be
the
true
supposing
its
history
and
doctrine
are
free
from
positive
objection
and
there
be
no
rival
religion
with
plausible
claims
of
its
own
nor
ought
this
trust
in
a
presumption
to
seem
preposterous
to
those
who
are
so
confident
on
grounds
that
the
moon
is
inhabited
by
rational
beings
and
that
the
course
of
nature
is
never
crossed
by
miraculous
agency
any
how
very
little
positive
evidence
seems
to
be
necessary
when
the
mind
is
penetrated
by
the
strong
anticipation
which
i
am
supposing
it
was
this
instinctive
apprehension
as
we
may
conjecture
which
carried
on
dionysius
and
damaris
at
athens
to
a
belief
in
christianity
though
paul
did
no
miracle
there
and
only
asserted
the
doctrines
of
the
divine
unity
the
resurrection
and
the
universal
judgment
while
on
the
other
hand
it
had
had
no
tendency
to
attach
them
to
any
of
the
mythological
rites
in
which
the
place
abounded
here
my
method
of
argument
differs
from
that
adopted
by
paley
in
his
evidences
of
christianity
this
and
almost
mathematical
reasoner
postulates
for
his
proof
of
its
miracles
only
thus
much
that
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
a
revelation
is
not
improbable
he
says
we
do
not
assume
the
attributes
of
the
deity
or
the
existence
of
a
future
it
is
not
necessary
for
our
purpose
that
these
propositions
viz
that
a
future
existence
should
be
destined
by
god
for
his
human
creation
and
that
being
so
destined
he
should
have
acquainted
them
with
it
be
capable
of
proof
or
even
that
by
arguments
drawn
from
the
light
of
nature
they
can
be
made
out
as
probable
it
is
enough
that
we
are
able
to
say
of
them
that
they
are
not
so
violently
improbable
so
contradictory
to
what
we
already
believe
of
the
divine
power
and
character
that
they
ought
to
be
rejected
at
first
sight
and
to
be
rejected
by
whatever
strength
or
complication
of
evidence
they
be
he
has
such
confidence
in
the
strength
of
the
testimony
which
he
can
produce
in
favour
of
the
christian
miracles
that
he
only
asks
to
be
allowed
to
bring
it
into
court
i
confess
to
much
suspicion
of
legal
proceedings
and
legal
arguments
when
used
in
questions
whether
of
history
or
of
philosophy
rules
of
court
are
dictated
by
what
is
expedient
on
the
whole
and
in
the
long
run
but
they
incur
the
risk
of
being
unjust
to
the
claims
of
particular
cases
why
am
i
to
begin
with
taking
up
a
position
not
my
own
and
unclothing
my
mind
of
that
large
outfit
of
existing
thoughts
principles
likings
desires
and
hopes
which
make
me
what
i
am
if
i
am
asked
to
use
paley
s
argument
for
my
own
conversion
i
say
plainly
i
do
not
want
to
be
converted
by
a
smart
syllogism
if
i
am
asked
to
convert
others
by
it
i
say
plainly
i
do
not
care
to
overcome
their
reason
without
touching
their
hearts
i
wish
to
deal
not
with
controversialists
but
with
inquirers
i
think
paley
s
argument
clear
clever
and
powerful
and
there
is
something
which
looks
like
charity
in
going
out
into
the
highways
and
hedges
and
compelling
men
to
come
in
but
in
this
matter
some
exertion
on
the
part
of
the
persons
whom
i
am
to
convert
is
a
condition
of
a
true
conversion
they
who
have
no
religious
earnestness
are
at
the
mercy
day
by
day
of
some
new
argument
or
fact
which
may
overtake
them
in
favour
of
one
conclusion
or
the
other
and
how
after
all
is
a
man
better
for
christianity
who
has
never
felt
the
need
of
it
or
the
desire
on
the
other
hand
if
he
has
longed
for
a
revelation
to
enlighten
him
and
to
cleanse
his
heart
why
may
he
not
use
in
his
inquiries
after
it
that
just
and
reasonable
anticipation
of
its
probability
which
such
longing
has
opened
the
way
to
his
entertaining
men
are
too
well
inclined
to
sit
at
home
instead
of
stirring
themselves
to
inquire
whether
a
revelation
has
been
given
they
expect
its
evidences
to
come
to
them
without
their
trouble
they
act
not
as
suppliants
but
as
judges
modes
of
argument
such
as
paley
s
encourage
this
state
of
mind
they
allow
men
to
forget
that
revelation
is
a
boon
not
a
debt
on
the
part
of
the
giver
they
treat
it
as
a
mere
historical
phenomenon
if
i
was
told
that
some
great
man
a
foreigner
whom
i
did
not
know
had
come
into
town
and
was
on
his
way
to
call
on
me
and
to
go
over
my
house
i
should
send
to
ascertain
the
fact
and
meanwhile
should
do
my
best
to
put
my
house
into
a
condition
to
receive
him
he
would
not
be
pleased
if
i
left
the
matter
to
take
its
chance
and
went
on
the
maxim
that
seeing
was
believing
like
this
is
the
conduct
of
those
who
resolve
to
treat
the
almighty
with
dispassionateness
a
judicial
temper
clearheadedness
and
candour
it
is
the
way
with
some
men
surely
not
a
good
way
to
say
that
without
these
lawyerlike
qualifications
conversion
is
immoral
it
is
their
way
a
miserable
way
to
pronounce
that
there
is
no
religious
love
of
truth
where
there
is
fear
of
error
on
the
contrary
i
would
maintain
that
the
fear
of
error
is
simply
necessary
to
the
genuine
love
of
truth
no
inquiry
comes
to
good
which
is
not
conducted
under
a
deep
sense
of
responsibility
and
of
the
issues
depending
upon
its
determination
even
the
ordinary
matters
of
life
are
an
exercise
of
conscientiousness
and
where
conscience
is
fear
must
be
so
much
is
this
acknowledged
just
now
that
there
is
almost
an
affectation
in
popular
literature
in
the
case
of
criticisms
on
the
fine
arts
on
poetry
and
music
of
speaking
about
conscientiousness
in
writing
painting
or
singing
and
that
earnestness
and
simplicity
of
mind
which
makes
men
fear
to
go
wrong
in
these
minor
matters
has
surely
a
place
in
the
most
serious
of
all
undertakings
it
is
on
these
grounds
that
in
considering
christianity
i
start
with
conditions
different
from
paley
s
not
however
as
undervaluing
the
force
and
the
serviceableness
of
his
argument
but
as
preferring
inquiry
to
disputation
in
a
question
about
truth
there
is
another
point
on
which
my
basis
of
argument
differs
from
paley
s
he
argues
on
the
principle
that
the
credentials
which
ascertain
for
us
a
message
from
above
are
necessarily
in
their
nature
miraculous
nor
have
i
any
thought
of
venturing
to
say
otherwise
in
fact
all
professed
revelations
have
been
attended
in
one
shape
or
another
with
the
profession
of
miracles
and
we
know
how
direct
and
unequivocal
are
the
miracles
of
both
the
jewish
covenant
and
of
our
own
however
my
object
here
is
to
assume
as
little
as
possible
as
regards
facts
and
to
dwell
only
on
what
is
patent
and
notorious
and
therefore
i
will
only
insist
on
those
coincidences
and
their
cumulations
which
though
not
in
themselves
miraculous
do
irresistibly
force
upon
us
almost
by
the
law
of
our
nature
the
presence
of
the
extraordinary
agency
of
him
whose
being
we
already
acknowledge
though
coincidences
rise
out
of
a
combination
of
general
laws
there
is
no
law
of
those
coincidences
they
have
a
character
of
their
own
and
seem
left
by
providence
in
his
own
hands
as
the
channel
by
which
inscrutable
to
us
he
may
make
known
to
us
his
will
for
instance
if
i
am
a
believer
in
a
god
of
truth
and
avenger
of
dishonesty
and
know
for
certain
that
a
after
calling
on
him
to
strike
her
dead
if
she
had
in
her
possession
a
piece
of
money
not
hers
did
fall
down
dead
on
the
spot
and
that
the
money
was
found
in
her
hand
how
can
i
call
this
a
blind
coincidence
and
not
discern
in
it
an
act
of
providence
over
and
above
its
general
laws
so
certainly
thought
the
inhabitants
of
an
english
town
when
they
erected
a
pillar
as
a
record
of
such
an
event
at
the
place
where
it
occurred
and
if
a
pope
excommunicates
a
great
conqueror
and
he
on
hearing
the
threat
says
to
one
of
his
friends
does
he
think
the
world
has
gone
back
a
thousand
years
does
he
suppose
the
arms
will
fall
from
the
hands
of
my
soldiers
and
within
two
years
on
the
retreat
over
the
snows
of
russia
as
two
contemporary
historians
relate
famine
and
cold
tore
their
arms
from
the
grasp
of
the
soldiers
they
fell
from
the
hands
of
the
bravest
and
most
robust
and
destitute
of
the
power
of
raising
them
from
the
ground
the
soldiers
left
them
in
the
snow
is
not
this
too
though
no
miracle
a
coincidence
so
special
as
rightly
to
be
called
a
divine
judgment
so
thinks
alison
who
avows
with
religious
honesty
that
there
is
something
in
these
marvellous
coincidences
beyond
the
operation
of
chance
and
which
even
a
protestant
historian
feels
himself
bound
to
mark
for
the
observation
of
future
years
and
so
too
of
a
cumulation
of
coincidences
separately
less
striking
when
spelman
sets
about
establishing
the
fact
of
the
which
in
a
multitude
of
instances
has
followed
upon
acts
of
sacrilege
then
even
though
in
many
instances
it
has
not
followed
and
in
many
instances
he
exaggerates
still
there
may
be
a
large
residuum
of
cases
which
can
not
be
properly
resolved
into
the
mere
accident
of
concurrent
causes
but
must
in
reason
be
considered
the
warning
voice
of
god
so
at
least
thought
gibson
bishop
of
london
when
he
wrote
many
of
the
instances
and
those
too
are
so
terrible
in
the
event
and
in
the
circumstances
so
surprising
that
no
considering
person
can
well
pass
them
i
think
then
that
the
circumstances
under
which
a
professed
revelation
comes
to
us
may
be
such
as
to
impress
both
our
reason
and
our
imagination
with
a
sense
of
its
truth
even
though
no
appeal
be
made
to
strictly
miraculous
saying
which
i
do
not
mean
of
course
to
imply
that
those
circumstances
when
traced
back
to
their
first
origins
are
not
the
outcome
of
such
intervention
but
that
the
miraculous
intervention
addresses
us
at
this
day
in
the
guise
of
those
circumstances
that
is
of
coincidences
which
are
indications
to
the
illative
sense
of
those
who
believe
in
a
moral
governor
of
his
immediate
presence
especially
to
those
who
in
addition
hold
with
me
the
strong
antecedent
probability
that
in
his
mercy
he
will
thus
supernaturally
present
himself
to
our
apprehension
now
as
to
the
fact
has
what
is
so
probable
in
anticipation
actually
been
granted
to
us
or
have
we
still
to
look
out
for
it
it
is
very
plain
supposing
it
has
been
granted
which
among
all
the
religions
of
the
world
comes
from
god
and
if
it
is
not
that
a
revelation
is
not
yet
given
and
we
must
look
forward
to
the
future
there
is
only
one
religion
in
the
world
which
tends
to
fulfil
the
aspirations
needs
and
foreshadowings
of
natural
faith
and
devotion
it
may
be
said
perhaps
that
educated
in
christianity
i
merely
judge
of
it
by
its
own
principles
but
this
is
not
the
fact
for
in
the
first
place
i
have
taken
my
idea
of
what
a
revelation
must
be
in
good
measure
from
the
actual
religions
of
the
world
and
as
to
its
ethics
the
ideas
with
which
i
come
to
it
are
derived
not
simply
from
the
gospel
but
prior
to
it
from
heathen
moralists
whom
fathers
of
the
church
and
ecclesiastical
writers
have
imitated
or
sanctioned
and
as
to
the
intellectual
position
from
which
i
have
contemplated
the
subject
aristotle
has
been
my
master
besides
i
do
not
here
single
out
christianity
with
reference
simply
to
its
particular
doctrines
or
precepts
but
for
a
reason
which
is
on
the
surface
of
its
history
it
alone
has
a
definite
message
addressed
to
all
mankind
as
far
as
i
know
the
religion
of
mahomet
has
brought
into
the
world
no
new
doctrine
whatever
except
indeed
that
of
its
own
divine
origin
and
the
character
of
its
teaching
is
too
exact
a
reflection
of
the
race
time
place
and
climate
in
which
it
arose
to
admit
of
its
becoming
universal
the
same
dependence
on
external
circumstances
is
characteristic
so
far
as
i
know
of
the
religions
of
the
far
east
nor
am
i
sure
of
any
definite
message
from
god
to
man
which
they
convey
and
protect
though
they
may
have
sacred
books
christianity
on
the
other
hand
is
in
its
idea
an
announcement
a
preaching
it
is
the
depositary
of
truths
beyond
human
discovery
momentous
practical
maintained
one
and
the
same
in
substance
in
every
age
from
its
first
and
addressed
to
all
mankind
and
it
has
actually
been
embraced
and
is
found
in
all
parts
of
the
world
in
all
climates
among
all
races
in
all
ranks
of
society
under
every
degree
of
civilization
from
barbarism
to
the
highest
cultivation
of
mind
coming
to
set
right
and
to
govern
the
world
it
has
ever
been
as
it
ought
to
be
in
conflict
with
large
masses
of
men
with
the
civil
power
with
physical
force
with
adverse
philosophies
it
has
had
successes
it
has
had
reverses
but
it
has
had
a
grand
history
and
has
effected
great
things
and
is
as
vigorous
in
its
age
as
in
its
youth
in
all
these
respects
it
has
a
distinction
in
the
world
and
a
of
its
own
it
has
upon
it
signs
of
divinity
i
do
not
know
what
can
be
advanced
by
rival
religions
to
match
prerogatives
so
special
so
that
i
feel
myself
justified
in
saying
either
christianity
is
from
god
or
a
revelation
has
not
yet
been
given
to
us
it
will
not
surely
be
objected
as
a
point
in
favour
of
some
of
the
oriental
religions
that
they
are
older
than
christianity
by
some
centuries
yet
should
it
be
so
said
it
must
be
recollected
that
christianity
is
only
the
continuation
and
conclusion
of
what
professes
to
be
an
earlier
revelation
which
may
be
traced
back
into
prehistoric
times
till
it
is
lost
in
the
darkness
that
hangs
over
them
as
far
as
we
know
there
never
was
a
time
when
that
revelation
was
not
revelation
continuous
and
systematic
with
distinct
representatives
and
an
orderly
succession
and
this
i
suppose
is
far
more
than
can
be
said
for
the
religions
of
the
east
here
then
i
am
brought
to
the
consideration
of
the
hebrew
nation
and
the
mosaic
religion
as
the
first
step
in
the
direct
evidence
for
christianity
the
jews
are
one
of
the
few
oriental
nations
who
are
known
in
history
as
a
people
of
progress
and
their
line
of
progress
is
the
development
of
religious
truth
in
that
their
own
line
they
stand
by
themselves
among
all
the
populations
not
only
of
the
east
but
of
the
west
their
country
may
be
called
the
classical
home
of
the
religious
principle
as
greece
is
the
home
of
intellectual
power
and
rome
that
of
political
and
practical
wisdom
theism
is
their
life
it
is
emphatically
their
national
religion
for
they
never
were
without
it
and
were
made
a
people
by
means
of
it
this
is
a
phenomenon
singular
and
solitary
in
history
and
must
have
a
meaning
if
there
be
a
god
and
providence
it
must
come
from
him
whether
immediately
or
indirectly
and
the
people
themselves
have
ever
maintained
that
it
has
been
his
direct
work
and
has
been
recognized
by
him
as
such
we
are
apt
to
treat
pretences
to
a
divine
mission
or
to
supernatural
powers
as
of
frequent
occurrence
and
on
that
score
to
dismiss
them
from
our
thoughts
but
we
can
not
so
deal
with
judaism
when
mankind
had
universally
denied
the
first
lesson
of
their
conscience
by
lapsing
into
polytheism
is
it
a
thing
of
slight
moment
that
there
was
just
one
exception
to
the
rule
that
there
was
just
one
people
who
first
by
their
rulers
and
priests
and
afterwards
by
their
own
unanimous
zeal
professed
as
their
distinguishing
doctrine
the
divine
unity
and
government
of
the
world
and
that
moreover
not
only
as
a
natural
truth
but
as
revealed
to
them
by
that
god
himself
of
whom
they
spoke
so
embodied
it
in
their
national
polity
that
a
theocracy
was
the
only
name
by
which
it
could
be
called
it
was
a
people
founded
and
set
up
in
theism
kept
together
by
theism
and
maintaining
theism
for
a
period
from
first
to
last
of
years
till
the
dissolution
of
their
body
politic
and
they
have
maintained
it
since
in
their
state
of
exile
and
wandering
for
years
more
they
begin
with
the
beginning
of
history
and
the
preaching
of
this
august
dogma
begins
with
them
they
are
its
witnesses
and
confessors
even
to
torture
and
death
on
it
and
its
revelation
are
moulded
their
laws
and
government
on
this
their
politics
philosophy
and
literature
are
founded
of
this
truth
their
poetry
is
the
voice
pouring
itself
out
in
devotional
compositions
which
christianity
through
all
its
many
countries
and
ages
has
been
unable
to
rival
on
this
aboriginal
truth
as
time
goes
on
prophet
after
prophet
bases
his
further
revelations
with
a
sustained
reference
to
a
time
when
according
to
the
secret
counsels
of
its
divine
object
and
author
it
is
to
receive
completion
and
perfection
at
length
that
time
comes
the
last
age
of
their
history
is
as
strange
as
their
first
when
that
time
of
destined
blessing
came
which
they
had
so
accurately
marked
out
and
were
so
carefully
waiting
time
which
found
them
in
fact
more
zealous
for
their
law
and
for
the
dogma
it
enshrined
than
they
ever
had
been
instead
of
any
final
favour
coming
on
them
from
above
they
fell
under
the
power
of
their
enemies
and
were
overthrown
their
holy
city
razed
to
the
ground
their
polity
destroyed
and
the
remnant
of
their
people
cast
off
to
wander
far
and
away
through
every
land
except
their
own
as
we
find
them
at
this
day
lasting
on
century
after
century
not
absorbed
in
other
populations
not
annihilated
as
likely
to
last
on
as
unlikely
to
be
restored
as
far
as
outward
appearances
go
now
as
a
thousand
years
ago
what
nation
has
so
grand
so
romantic
so
terrible
a
history
does
it
not
fulfil
the
idea
of
what
the
nation
calls
itself
a
chosen
people
chosen
for
good
and
evil
is
it
not
an
exhibition
in
a
course
of
history
of
that
primary
declaration
of
conscience
as
i
have
been
determining
it
with
the
upright
thou
shalt
be
upright
and
with
the
froward
thou
shalt
be
froward
it
must
have
a
meaning
if
there
is
a
god
we
know
what
was
their
witness
of
old
time
what
is
their
witness
now
why
i
say
was
it
that
after
so
memorable
a
career
when
their
sins
and
sufferings
were
now
to
come
to
an
end
when
they
were
looking
out
for
a
deliverance
and
a
deliverer
suddenly
all
was
reversed
for
once
and
for
all
they
were
the
favoured
servants
of
god
and
yet
a
peculiar
reproach
and
note
of
infamy
is
affixed
to
their
name
it
was
their
belief
that
his
protection
was
unchangeable
and
that
their
law
would
last
for
ever
was
their
consolation
to
be
taught
by
an
uninterrupted
tradition
that
it
could
not
die
except
by
changing
into
a
new
self
more
wonderful
than
it
was
before
was
their
faithful
expectation
that
a
promised
king
was
coming
the
messiah
who
would
extend
the
sway
of
israel
over
all
people
was
a
condition
of
their
covenant
that
as
a
reward
to
abraham
their
first
father
the
day
at
length
should
dawn
when
the
gates
of
their
narrow
land
should
open
and
they
should
pour
out
for
the
conquest
and
occupation
of
the
whole
earth
i
repeat
when
the
day
came
they
did
go
forth
and
they
did
spread
into
all
lands
but
as
hopeless
exiles
as
eternal
wanderers
are
we
to
say
that
this
failure
is
a
proof
that
after
all
there
was
nothing
providential
in
their
history
for
myself
i
do
not
see
how
a
second
portent
obliterates
a
first
and
in
truth
their
own
testimony
and
their
own
sacred
books
carry
us
on
towards
a
better
solution
of
the
difficulty
i
have
said
they
were
in
god
s
favour
under
a
covenant
they
did
not
fulfil
the
conditions
of
it
this
indeed
seems
to
be
their
own
account
of
the
matter
though
it
is
not
clear
what
their
breach
of
engagement
was
and
that
in
some
way
they
did
sin
whatever
their
sin
was
is
corroborated
by
the
chapter
in
the
book
of
deuteronomy
which
so
strikingly
anticipates
the
nature
of
their
punishment
that
passage
translated
into
greek
as
many
as
years
before
the
siege
of
jerusalem
by
titus
has
on
it
the
marks
of
a
wonderful
prophecy
but
i
am
not
now
referring
to
it
as
such
but
merely
as
an
indication
that
the
disappointment
which
actually
overtook
them
at
the
christian
era
was
not
necessarily
out
of
keeping
with
the
original
divine
purpose
or
again
with
the
old
promise
made
to
them
and
their
confident
expectation
of
its
fulfilment
their
national
ruin
which
came
instead
of
aggrandizement
is
described
in
that
book
in
spite
of
all
promises
with
an
emphasis
and
minuteness
which
prove
that
it
was
contemplated
long
before
at
least
as
a
possible
issue
of
the
fortunes
of
israel
among
other
inflictions
which
should
befall
the
guilty
people
it
was
told
them
that
they
should
fall
down
before
their
enemies
and
should
be
scattered
throughout
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
that
they
never
should
have
quiet
in
those
nations
or
have
rest
for
the
sole
of
their
foot
that
they
were
to
have
a
fearful
heart
and
languishing
eyes
and
a
soul
consumed
with
heaviness
that
they
were
to
suffer
wrong
and
to
be
crushed
at
all
times
and
to
be
astonished
at
the
terror
of
their
lot
that
their
sons
and
daughters
were
to
be
given
to
another
people
and
they
were
to
look
and
to
sicken
all
the
day
and
their
life
was
ever
to
hang
in
doubt
before
them
and
fear
to
haunt
them
day
and
night
that
they
should
be
a
proverb
and
a
of
all
people
among
whom
they
were
brought
and
that
curses
were
to
come
on
them
and
to
be
signs
and
wonders
on
them
and
their
seed
for
ever
such
are
some
portions
and
not
the
most
terrible
of
this
extended
anathema
and
its
partial
accomplishment
at
an
earlier
date
of
their
history
was
a
warning
to
them
when
the
destined
time
drew
near
that
however
great
the
promises
made
to
them
might
be
those
promises
were
dependent
on
the
terms
of
the
covenant
which
stood
between
them
and
their
maker
and
that
as
they
had
turned
to
curses
at
that
former
time
so
they
might
turn
to
curses
again
this
grand
drama
so
impressed
with
the
characters
of
supernatural
agency
concerns
us
here
only
in
its
bearing
upon
the
evidence
for
the
divine
origin
of
christianity
and
it
is
at
this
point
that
christianity
comes
upon
the
historical
scene
it
is
a
notorious
fact
that
it
issued
from
the
jewish
land
and
people
and
had
it
no
other
than
this
historical
connexion
with
judaism
it
would
have
some
share
in
the
prestige
of
its
original
home
but
it
claims
to
be
far
more
than
this
it
professes
to
be
the
actual
completion
of
the
mosaic
law
the
promised
means
of
deliverance
and
triumph
to
the
nation
which
that
nation
itself
as
i
have
said
has
since
considered
to
be
on
account
of
some
sin
or
other
withheld
or
forfeited
it
professes
to
be
not
the
casual
but
the
legitimate
offspring
heir
and
successor
of
the
mosaic
covenant
or
rather
to
be
judaism
itself
developed
and
transformed
of
course
it
has
to
prove
its
claim
as
well
as
to
prefer
it
but
if
it
succeeds
in
doing
so
then
all
those
tokens
of
the
divine
presence
which
distinguish
the
jewish
history
at
once
belong
to
it
and
are
a
portion
of
its
credentials
and
at
least
the
view
of
its
relations
towards
judaism
is
in
favour
of
these
pretensions
it
is
an
historical
fact
that
at
the
very
time
that
the
jews
committed
their
unpardonable
sin
whatever
it
was
and
were
driven
out
from
their
home
to
wander
over
the
earth
their
christian
brethren
born
of
the
same
stock
and
equally
citizens
of
jerusalem
did
also
issue
forth
from
the
same
home
but
in
order
to
subdue
that
same
earth
and
make
it
their
own
that
is
they
undertook
the
very
work
which
according
to
the
promise
their
nation
actually
was
ordained
to
execute
and
with
a
method
of
their
own
indeed
and
with
a
new
end
and
only
slowly
and
painfully
but
still
really
and
thoroughly
they
did
it
and
since
that
time
the
two
children
of
the
promise
have
ever
been
found
the
promise
forfeited
and
the
promise
fulfilled
and
whereas
the
christian
has
been
in
high
place
so
the
jew
has
been
degraded
and
one
has
been
the
head
and
the
other
the
tail
so
that
to
go
no
farther
the
fact
that
christianity
actually
has
done
what
judaism
was
to
have
done
decides
the
controversy
by
the
logic
of
facts
in
favour
of
christianity
the
prophecies
announced
that
the
messiah
was
to
come
at
a
definite
time
and
place
christians
point
to
him
as
coming
then
and
there
as
announced
they
are
not
met
by
any
counter
claim
or
rival
claimant
on
the
part
of
the
jews
only
by
their
assertion
that
he
did
not
come
at
all
though
up
to
the
event
they
had
said
he
was
then
and
there
coming
further
christianity
clears
up
the
mystery
which
hangs
over
judaism
accounting
fully
for
the
punishment
of
the
people
by
specifying
their
sin
their
heinous
sin
if
instead
of
hailing
their
own
messiah
they
crucified
him
then
the
strange
scourge
which
has
pursued
them
after
the
deed
and
the
energetic
wording
of
the
curse
before
it
are
explained
by
the
very
strangeness
of
their
guilt
rather
their
sin
is
their
punishment
for
in
rejecting
their
divine
king
they
lost
the
living
principle
and
tie
of
their
nationality
moreover
we
see
what
led
them
into
error
they
thought
a
triumph
and
an
empire
were
to
be
given
to
them
at
once
which
were
given
indeed
eventually
but
by
the
slow
and
gradual
growth
of
many
centuries
and
a
long
warfare
on
the
whole
then
i
observe
on
the
one
hand
that
judaism
having
been
the
channel
of
religious
traditions
which
are
lost
in
the
depth
of
their
antiquity
of
course
it
is
a
great
point
for
christianity
to
succeed
in
proving
that
it
is
the
legitimate
heir
to
that
former
religion
nor
is
it
on
the
other
of
less
importance
to
the
significance
of
those
early
traditions
to
be
able
to
determine
that
they
were
not
lost
together
with
their
original
but
were
transferred
on
the
failure
of
judaism
to
the
custody
of
the
christian
church
and
this
apparent
correspondence
between
the
two
is
in
itself
a
presumption
for
such
correspondence
being
real
next
i
observe
that
if
the
history
of
judaism
is
so
wonderful
as
to
suggest
the
presence
of
some
special
divine
agency
in
its
appointments
and
fortunes
still
more
wonderful
and
divine
is
the
history
of
christianity
and
again
it
is
more
wonderful
still
that
two
such
wonderful
creations
should
span
almost
the
whole
course
of
ages
during
which
nations
and
states
have
been
in
existence
and
should
constitute
a
professed
system
of
continued
intercourse
between
earth
and
heaven
from
first
to
last
amid
all
the
vicissitudes
of
human
affairs
this
phenomenon
again
carries
on
its
face
to
those
who
believe
in
a
god
the
probability
that
it
has
that
divine
origin
which
it
professes
to
have
and
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
strong
presumption
which
i
have
insisted
on
that
in
god
s
mercy
a
revelation
from
him
will
be
granted
to
us
and
of
the
contrast
presented
by
other
religions
no
one
of
which
professes
to
be
a
revelation
direct
definite
and
integral
as
this
is
phenomenon
i
say
of
cumulative
marvels
raises
that
probability
both
for
judaism
and
christianity
in
religious
minds
almost
to
a
certainty
if
christianity
is
connected
with
judaism
as
closely
as
i
have
been
supposing
then
there
have
been
by
means
of
the
two
direct
communications
between
man
and
his
maker
from
time
immemorial
down
to
this
great
prerogative
such
that
it
is
nowhere
else
even
claimed
no
other
religion
but
these
two
professes
to
be
the
organ
of
a
formal
revelation
certainly
not
of
a
revelation
which
is
directed
to
the
benefit
of
the
whole
human
race
here
it
is
that
mahometanism
fails
though
it
claims
to
carry
on
the
line
of
revelation
after
christianity
for
it
is
the
mere
creed
and
rite
of
certain
races
bringing
with
it
as
such
no
gifts
to
our
nature
and
is
rather
a
reformation
of
local
corruptions
and
a
return
to
the
ceremonial
worship
of
earlier
times
than
a
new
and
larger
revelation
and
while
christianity
was
the
heir
to
a
dead
religion
mahometanism
was
little
more
than
a
rebellion
against
a
living
one
moreover
though
mahomet
professed
to
be
the
paraclete
no
one
pretends
that
he
occupies
a
place
in
the
christian
scriptures
as
prominent
as
that
which
the
messiah
fills
in
the
jewish
to
this
especial
prominence
of
the
messianic
idea
i
shall
now
advert
that
is
to
the
prophecies
of
the
old
scriptures
and
to
the
argument
which
they
furnish
in
favour
of
christianity
and
though
i
know
that
argument
might
be
clearer
and
more
exact
than
it
is
and
i
do
not
pretend
here
to
do
much
more
than
refer
to
the
fact
of
its
existence
still
so
far
forth
as
we
enter
into
it
will
it
strengthen
our
conviction
of
the
claim
to
divinity
both
of
the
religion
which
is
the
organ
of
those
prophecies
and
of
the
religion
which
is
their
object
now
that
the
jewish
scriptures
were
in
existence
long
before
the
christian
era
and
were
in
the
sole
custody
of
the
jews
is
undeniable
whatever
then
their
scriptures
distinctly
say
of
christianity
if
not
attributable
to
chance
or
to
happy
conjecture
is
prophetic
it
is
undeniable
too
that
the
jews
gathered
from
those
books
that
a
great
personage
was
to
be
born
of
their
stock
and
to
conquer
the
whole
world
and
to
become
the
instrument
of
extraordinary
blessings
to
it
moreover
that
he
would
make
his
appearance
at
a
fixed
date
and
that
the
very
date
when
as
it
turned
out
our
lord
did
actually
come
this
is
the
great
outline
of
the
prediction
and
if
nothing
more
could
be
said
about
them
than
this
to
prove
as
much
as
this
is
far
from
unimportant
and
it
is
undeniable
i
say
both
that
the
jewish
scriptures
contain
thus
much
and
that
the
jews
actually
understood
them
as
containing
it
first
then
as
to
what
scripture
declares
from
the
book
of
genesis
we
learn
that
the
chosen
people
was
set
up
in
this
one
idea
viz
to
be
a
blessing
to
the
whole
earth
and
that
by
means
of
one
of
their
own
race
a
greater
than
their
father
abraham
this
was
the
meaning
and
drift
of
their
being
chosen
there
is
no
room
for
mistake
here
the
divine
purpose
is
stated
from
the
first
with
the
utmost
precision
at
the
very
time
of
abraham
s
call
he
is
told
of
it
i
will
make
of
thee
a
great
nation
and
in
thee
shall
all
tribes
of
the
earth
be
thrice
is
this
promise
and
purpose
announced
in
abraham
s
history
and
after
abraham
s
time
it
is
repeated
to
isaac
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
be
blessed
and
after
isaac
to
jacob
when
a
wanderer
from
his
home
in
thee
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
be
and
from
jacob
the
promise
passes
on
to
his
son
judah
and
that
with
an
addition
viz
with
a
reference
to
the
great
person
who
was
to
be
the
blessing
and
to
the
date
when
he
should
come
judah
was
the
chosen
son
of
jacob
and
his
staff
or
sceptre
that
is
his
patriarchal
authority
was
to
endure
till
a
greater
than
judah
came
so
that
the
loss
of
the
sceptre
when
it
took
place
was
the
sign
of
his
near
approach
the
sceptre
says
jacob
on
his
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
judah
until
he
come
for
whom
it
is
reserved
or
who
is
to
be
sent
and
he
shall
be
the
expectation
of
the
nations
such
was
the
categorical
prophecy
literal
and
unequivocal
in
its
wording
direct
and
simple
in
its
scope
one
man
born
of
the
chosen
tribe
was
the
destined
minister
of
blessing
to
the
whole
world
and
the
race
as
represented
by
that
tribe
was
to
lose
its
old
self
in
gaining
a
new
self
in
him
its
destiny
was
sealed
upon
it
in
its
beginning
an
expectation
was
the
measure
of
its
life
it
was
created
for
a
great
end
and
in
that
end
it
had
its
ending
such
were
the
initial
communications
made
to
the
chosen
people
and
there
they
stopped
if
the
outline
of
promise
so
sharply
cut
had
to
be
effectually
imprinted
on
their
minds
before
more
knowledge
was
given
to
them
as
if
by
the
long
interval
of
years
which
passed
before
the
more
varied
prophecies
in
type
and
figure
after
the
manner
of
the
east
were
added
the
original
notices
might
stand
out
in
the
sight
of
all
in
their
severe
explicitness
as
archetypal
truths
and
guides
in
interpreting
whatever
else
was
obscure
in
its
wording
or
complex
in
its
direction
and
in
the
second
place
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
jews
did
thus
understand
their
prophecies
and
did
expect
their
great
ruler
in
the
very
age
in
which
our
lord
came
and
in
which
they
on
the
other
hand
were
destroyed
losing
their
old
self
without
gaining
their
new
heathen
historians
shall
speak
for
the
fact
a
persuasion
had
possession
of
most
of
them
says
tacitus
speaking
of
their
resistance
to
the
romans
that
it
was
contained
in
the
ancient
books
of
the
priests
that
at
that
very
time
the
east
should
prevail
and
that
men
who
issued
from
judea
should
obtain
the
empire
the
common
people
as
is
the
way
with
human
cupidity
having
once
interpreted
in
their
own
favour
this
grand
destiny
were
not
even
by
their
reverses
brought
round
to
the
truth
of
and
suetonius
extends
the
belief
the
whole
east
was
rife
with
an
old
and
persistent
belief
that
at
that
time
persons
who
issued
from
judea
should
possess
the
after
the
event
of
course
the
jews
drew
back
and
denied
the
correctness
of
their
expectation
still
they
could
not
deny
that
the
expectation
had
existed
thus
the
jew
josephus
who
was
of
the
roman
party
says
that
what
encouraged
them
in
the
stand
they
made
against
the
romans
was
an
ambiguous
oracle
found
in
their
sacred
writings
that
at
that
date
some
one
of
them
from
that
country
should
rule
the
he
can
but
pronounce
that
the
oracle
was
ambiguous
he
can
not
state
that
they
thought
it
so
now
considering
that
at
that
very
time
our
lord
did
appear
as
a
teacher
and
founded
not
merely
a
religion
but
what
was
then
quite
a
new
idea
in
the
world
a
system
of
religious
warfare
an
aggressive
and
militant
body
a
dominant
catholic
church
which
aimed
at
the
benefit
of
all
nations
by
the
spiritual
conquest
of
all
and
that
this
warfare
then
begun
by
it
has
gone
on
without
cessation
down
to
this
day
and
now
is
as
living
and
real
as
ever
it
was
that
that
militant
body
has
from
the
first
filled
the
world
that
it
has
had
wonderful
successes
that
its
successes
have
on
the
whole
been
of
extreme
benefit
to
the
human
race
that
it
has
imparted
an
intelligent
notion
about
the
supreme
god
to
millions
who
would
have
lived
and
died
in
irreligion
that
it
has
raised
the
tone
of
morality
wherever
it
has
come
has
abolished
great
social
anomalies
and
miseries
has
elevated
the
female
sex
to
its
proper
dignity
has
protected
the
poorer
classes
has
destroyed
slavery
encouraged
literature
and
philosophy
and
had
a
principal
part
in
that
civilization
of
human
kind
which
with
some
evils
still
has
on
the
whole
been
productive
of
far
greater
good
i
say
that
all
this
began
at
the
destined
expected
recognized
season
when
the
old
prophecy
said
that
in
one
man
born
of
the
tribe
of
judah
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
were
to
be
blessed
i
feel
i
have
a
right
to
say
and
my
line
of
argument
does
not
lead
me
to
say
more
that
it
is
at
the
very
least
a
remarkable
coincidence
is
one
of
those
coincidences
which
when
they
are
accumulated
come
close
upon
the
idea
of
miracle
as
being
impossible
without
the
hand
of
god
directly
and
immediately
in
them
when
we
have
got
as
far
as
this
we
may
go
on
a
great
deal
farther
announcements
which
could
not
be
put
forward
in
the
front
of
the
argument
as
being
figurative
vague
or
ambiguous
may
be
used
validly
and
with
great
effect
when
they
have
been
interpreted
for
us
first
by
the
prophetic
outline
and
still
more
by
the
historical
object
it
is
a
principle
which
applies
to
all
matters
on
which
we
reason
that
what
is
only
a
maze
of
facts
without
order
or
drift
prior
to
the
explanation
may
when
we
once
have
that
explanation
be
located
and
adjusted
with
great
facility
in
all
its
separate
parts
as
we
know
is
the
case
as
regards
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
since
the
hypothesis
of
newton
in
like
manner
the
event
is
the
true
key
to
prophecy
and
reconciles
conflicting
and
divergent
descriptions
by
embodying
them
in
one
common
representative
thus
it
is
that
we
learn
how
as
the
prophecies
said
the
messiah
could
both
suffer
yet
be
victorious
his
kingdom
be
judaic
in
structure
yet
evangelic
in
spirit
and
his
people
the
children
of
abraham
yet
sinners
of
the
these
seeming
paradoxes
are
only
parallel
and
akin
to
those
others
which
form
so
prominent
a
feature
in
the
teaching
of
our
lord
and
his
apostles
as
to
the
jews
since
they
lived
before
the
event
it
is
not
wonderful
that
though
they
were
right
in
their
general
interpretation
of
scripture
as
far
as
it
went
they
stopped
short
of
the
whole
truth
nay
that
even
when
their
messiah
came
they
could
not
recognize
him
as
the
promised
king
as
we
recognize
him
now
we
have
the
experience
of
his
history
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
by
which
to
interpret
their
scriptures
we
may
partly
understand
their
position
towards
those
prophecies
by
our
own
at
present
towards
the
apocalypse
who
can
deny
the
superhuman
grandeur
and
impressiveness
of
that
sacred
book
yet
as
a
prophecy
though
some
outlines
of
the
future
are
discernible
how
differently
it
affects
us
from
the
predictions
of
isaiah
either
because
it
relates
to
events
still
to
come
or
because
it
has
been
fulfilled
long
ago
in
events
which
in
their
detail
and
circumstance
have
never
become
history
and
the
same
remark
applies
doubtless
to
portions
of
the
messianic
prophecies
still
but
if
their
fulfilment
has
been
thus
gradual
in
time
past
we
must
not
be
surprised
though
portions
of
them
still
await
their
slow
but
true
accomplishment
in
the
future
when
i
implied
that
in
some
points
of
view
christianity
has
not
answered
the
expectations
of
the
old
prophecies
of
which
it
claims
to
be
the
fulfilment
i
had
in
mind
principally
the
contrast
which
is
presented
to
us
between
the
picture
which
they
draw
of
the
universality
of
the
kingdom
of
the
messiah
and
that
partial
development
of
it
through
the
world
which
is
all
the
christian
church
can
show
and
again
the
contrast
between
the
rest
and
peace
which
they
said
he
was
to
introduce
and
the
church
s
actual
history
conflicts
of
opinion
which
have
raged
within
its
pale
the
violent
acts
and
unworthy
lives
of
many
of
its
rulers
and
the
moral
degradation
of
great
masses
of
its
people
i
do
not
profess
to
meet
these
difficulties
here
except
by
saying
that
the
failure
of
christianity
in
one
respect
in
corresponding
to
those
prophecies
can
not
destroy
the
force
of
its
correspondence
to
them
in
others
just
as
we
may
allow
that
the
portrait
of
a
friend
is
a
faulty
likeness
to
him
and
yet
be
quite
sure
that
it
is
his
portrait
what
i
shall
actually
attempt
to
show
here
is
this
christianity
was
quite
aware
from
the
first
of
its
own
prospective
future
so
unlike
the
expectations
which
the
prophets
would
excite
concerning
it
and
that
it
meets
the
difficulty
thence
arising
by
anticipation
by
giving
us
its
own
predictions
of
what
it
was
to
be
in
historical
fact
predictions
which
are
at
once
explanatory
comments
upon
the
jewish
scriptures
and
direct
evidences
of
its
own
prescience
i
think
it
observable
then
that
though
our
lord
claims
to
be
the
messiah
he
shows
so
little
of
conscious
dependence
on
the
old
scriptures
or
of
anxiety
to
fulfil
them
as
if
it
became
him
who
was
the
lord
of
the
prophets
to
take
his
own
course
and
to
leave
their
utterances
to
adjust
themselves
to
him
as
they
could
and
not
to
be
careful
to
accommodate
himself
to
them
the
evangelists
do
indeed
show
some
such
natural
zeal
in
his
behalf
and
thereby
illustrate
what
i
notice
in
him
by
the
contrast
they
betray
an
earnestness
to
trace
in
his
person
and
history
the
accomplishment
of
prophecy
as
when
they
discern
it
in
his
return
from
egypt
in
his
life
at
nazareth
in
the
gentleness
and
tenderness
of
his
mode
of
teaching
and
in
the
various
minute
occurrences
of
his
passion
but
he
himself
goes
straight
forward
on
his
way
of
course
claiming
to
be
the
messiah
of
the
prophets
still
not
so
much
recurring
to
past
prophecies
as
uttering
new
ones
with
an
antithesis
not
unlike
that
which
is
so
impressive
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
when
he
first
says
it
has
been
said
by
them
of
old
time
and
then
adds
but
i
say
unto
another
striking
instance
of
this
is
seen
in
the
names
under
which
he
spoke
of
himself
which
have
little
or
no
foundation
in
any
thing
which
was
said
of
him
beforehand
in
the
jewish
scriptures
they
speak
of
him
as
ruler
prophet
king
hope
of
israel
offspring
of
judah
and
messiah
and
his
evangelists
and
disciples
call
him
master
lord
prophet
son
of
david
king
of
israel
king
of
the
jews
and
messiah
or
christ
but
he
himself
though
i
repeat
he
acknowledges
these
titles
as
his
own
especially
that
of
the
christ
chooses
as
his
special
designations
these
two
son
of
god
and
son
of
man
the
latter
of
which
is
only
once
given
him
in
the
old
scriptures
and
by
which
he
corrects
any
narrow
judaic
interpretation
of
them
while
the
former
was
never
distinctly
used
of
him
before
he
came
and
seems
first
to
have
been
announced
to
the
world
by
the
angel
gabriel
and
john
the
baptist
in
those
two
names
son
of
god
and
son
of
man
declaratory
of
the
two
natures
of
emmanuel
he
separates
himself
from
the
jewish
dispensation
in
which
he
was
born
and
inaugurates
the
new
covenant
this
is
not
an
accident
and
i
shall
now
give
some
instances
of
it
that
is
of
what
i
may
call
the
independent
autocratic
view
which
he
takes
of
his
own
religion
into
which
the
old
judaism
was
melting
and
of
the
prophetic
insight
into
its
spirit
and
its
future
which
that
view
involves
in
quoting
his
own
sayings
from
the
evangelists
for
this
purpose
i
assume
of
which
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
that
they
wrote
before
any
historical
events
had
happened
of
a
nature
to
cause
them
unconsciously
to
modify
or
to
colour
the
language
which
their
master
used
first
then
the
fact
has
been
often
insisted
on
as
a
bold
conception
unheard
of
before
and
worthy
of
divine
origin
that
he
should
even
project
a
universal
religion
and
that
to
be
effected
by
what
may
be
called
a
propagandist
movement
from
one
centre
hitherto
it
had
been
the
received
notion
in
the
world
that
each
nation
had
its
own
gods
the
romans
legislated
upon
that
basis
and
the
jews
had
held
it
from
the
first
holding
of
course
also
that
all
gods
but
their
own
god
were
idols
and
demons
it
is
true
that
the
jews
ought
to
have
been
taught
by
their
prophecies
what
was
in
store
for
the
world
and
for
them
and
that
their
first
dispersion
through
the
empire
centuries
before
christ
came
and
the
proselytes
which
they
collected
around
them
in
every
place
were
a
kind
of
comment
on
the
prophecies
larger
than
their
own
but
we
see
what
was
in
fact
when
our
lord
came
their
expectation
from
those
prophecies
in
the
passages
which
i
have
quoted
above
from
the
roman
historians
of
his
day
but
he
from
the
first
resisted
those
plausible
but
mistaken
interpretations
of
scripture
in
his
cradle
indeed
he
had
been
recognized
by
the
eastern
sages
as
their
king
the
angel
announced
that
he
was
to
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
nathanael
too
owned
him
as
the
messiah
with
a
regal
title
but
he
on
entering
upon
his
work
interpreted
these
anticipations
in
his
own
way
and
that
not
the
way
of
theudas
and
judas
of
galilee
who
took
the
sword
and
collected
soldiers
about
them
the
way
of
the
tempter
who
offered
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
in
the
words
of
the
evangelists
he
began
not
to
fight
but
to
preach
and
further
to
preach
the
kingdom
of
heaven
saying
the
time
is
accomplished
and
the
kingdom
of
god
is
at
hand
repent
and
believe
the
this
is
the
significant
title
the
kingdom
of
heaven
more
significant
when
explained
by
the
attendant
precept
of
repentance
and
faith
which
he
founds
the
polity
which
he
was
establishing
from
first
to
last
one
of
his
last
sayings
before
he
suffered
was
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
and
his
last
words
before
he
left
the
earth
when
his
disciples
asked
him
about
his
kingdom
were
that
they
preachers
as
they
were
and
not
soldiers
should
be
his
witnesses
to
the
end
of
the
earth
should
preach
to
all
nations
beginning
with
jerusalem
should
go
into
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
should
go
and
make
disciples
of
all
nations
till
the
consummation
of
all
the
last
evangelist
of
the
four
is
equally
precise
in
recording
the
initial
purpose
with
which
our
lord
began
his
ministry
viz
to
create
an
empire
not
by
force
but
by
persuasion
light
is
come
into
the
world
every
one
that
doth
evil
hateth
the
light
but
he
that
doth
truth
cometh
to
the
lift
up
your
eyes
and
see
the
countries
for
they
are
white
already
to
no
man
can
come
to
me
except
the
father
who
hath
sent
me
draw
and
i
if
i
be
lifted
up
from
the
earth
will
draw
all
things
to
thus
while
the
jews
relying
on
their
scriptures
with
great
appearance
of
reason
looked
for
a
deliverer
who
should
conquer
with
the
sword
we
find
that
christianity
from
the
first
not
by
an
upon
trial
and
experience
but
as
a
fundamental
truth
magisterially
set
right
that
mistake
transfiguring
the
old
prophecies
and
bringing
to
light
as
paul
might
say
the
mystery
which
had
been
hidden
from
ages
and
generations
but
now
was
made
manifest
in
his
saints
the
glory
of
this
mystery
among
the
gentiles
which
is
christ
in
you
not
simply
over
you
but
in
you
by
faith
and
love
the
hope
of
i
have
partly
anticipated
my
next
remark
which
relates
to
the
means
by
which
the
christian
enterprise
was
to
be
carried
into
effect
that
preaching
was
to
have
a
share
in
the
victories
of
the
messiah
was
plain
from
prophet
and
psalmist
but
then
charlemagne
preached
and
mahomet
preached
with
an
army
to
back
them
the
same
psalm
which
speaks
of
those
who
preach
good
tidings
speaks
also
of
their
king
s
foot
being
dipped
in
the
blood
of
his
enemies
but
what
is
so
grandly
original
in
christianity
is
that
on
its
broad
field
of
conflict
its
preachers
were
to
be
simply
unarmed
and
to
suffer
but
to
prevail
if
we
were
not
so
familiar
with
our
lord
s
words
i
think
they
would
astonish
us
behold
i
send
you
as
sheep
in
the
midst
of
this
was
to
be
their
normal
state
and
so
it
was
and
all
the
promises
and
directions
given
to
them
imply
it
blessed
are
they
that
suffer
persecution
blessed
are
ye
when
they
revile
you
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth
resist
not
evil
you
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name
s
sake
a
man
s
enemies
shall
be
they
of
his
own
household
he
that
shall
persevere
to
the
end
he
shall
be
what
sort
of
encouragement
was
this
for
men
who
were
to
go
about
an
immense
work
do
men
in
this
way
send
out
their
soldiers
to
battle
or
their
sons
to
india
or
australia
the
king
of
israel
hated
micaiah
because
he
always
prophesied
of
him
so
persecuted
they
the
prophets
that
were
before
you
says
our
lord
yes
and
the
prophets
failed
they
were
persecuted
and
they
lost
the
battle
take
my
brethren
says
james
for
an
example
of
suffering
evil
of
labour
and
patience
the
prophets
who
spake
in
the
name
of
the
they
were
racked
mocked
stoned
cut
asunder
they
wandered
about
whom
the
world
was
not
worthy
says
paul
what
an
argument
to
encourage
them
to
aim
at
success
by
suffering
to
put
before
them
the
precedent
of
those
who
suffered
and
who
failed
yet
the
first
preachers
our
lord
s
immediate
disciples
saw
no
difficulty
in
a
prospect
to
human
eyes
so
appalling
so
hopeless
how
connatural
this
strange
unreasoning
reckless
courage
was
with
their
regenerate
state
is
shown
most
signally
in
paul
as
having
been
a
convert
of
later
vocation
he
was
no
personal
associate
of
our
lord
s
yet
how
faithfully
he
echoes
back
our
lord
s
language
his
instrument
of
conversion
is
the
foolishness
of
preaching
the
weak
things
of
the
earth
confound
the
strong
we
hunger
and
thirst
and
are
naked
and
are
buffeted
and
have
no
home
we
are
reviled
and
bless
we
are
persecuted
and
blasphemed
and
are
made
the
refuse
of
this
world
and
the
offscouring
of
all
such
is
the
intimate
comprehension
on
the
part
of
one
who
had
never
seen
our
lord
on
earth
and
knew
little
from
his
original
disciples
of
the
genius
of
his
teaching
considering
that
the
prophecies
upon
which
he
had
lived
from
his
birth
for
the
most
part
bear
on
their
surface
a
contrary
doctrine
and
that
the
jews
of
that
day
did
commonly
understand
them
in
that
contrary
sense
we
can
not
deny
that
christianity
in
tracing
out
the
method
by
which
it
was
to
prevail
in
the
future
took
its
own
independent
line
and
in
assigning
from
the
first
a
rule
and
a
history
to
its
propagation
a
rule
and
a
history
which
have
been
carried
out
to
this
day
rescues
itself
from
the
charge
of
but
partially
fulfilling
those
jewish
prophecies
by
the
assumption
of
a
prophetical
character
of
its
own
now
we
come
to
a
third
point
in
which
the
divine
master
explains
and
in
a
certain
sense
corrects
the
prophecies
of
the
old
covenant
by
a
more
exact
interpretation
of
them
from
himself
i
have
granted
that
they
seemed
to
say
that
his
coming
would
issue
in
a
period
of
peace
and
religiousness
behold
says
the
prophet
a
king
shall
reign
in
justice
and
princes
shall
rule
in
judgment
the
fool
shall
no
more
be
called
prince
neither
shall
the
deceitful
be
called
great
the
wolf
shall
dwell
with
the

and
the
leopard
lie
down
with
the
kid
they
shall
not
hurt
nor
kill
in
all
my
holy
mountain
for
the
earth
is
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
as
the
covering
waters
of
the
these
words
seem
to
predict
a
reversal
of
the
consequences
of
the
fall
and
that
reversal
has
not
been
granted
to
us
it
is
true
but
let
us
consider
how
distinctly
christianity
warns
us
against
any
such
anticipation
while
it
is
so
forcibly
laid
down
in
the
gospels
that
the
history
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
begins
in
suffering
and
sanctity
it
is
as
plainly
said
that
it
results
in
unfaithfulness
and
sin
that
is
to
say
that
though
there
are
at
all
times
many
holy
many
religious
men
in
it
and
though
sanctity
as
at
the
beginning
is
ever
the
life
and
the
substance
and
the
germinal
seed
of
the
divine
kingdom
yet
there
will
be
many
too
there
will
be
more
who
by
their
lives
are
a
scandal
and
injury
to
it
not
a
defence
this
again
is
an
astonishing
announcement
and
the
more
so
when
viewed
in
contrast
with
the
precepts
delivered
by
our
lord
in
his
sermon
on
the
mount
and
his
description
to
the
apostles
of
their
weapons
and
their
warfare
so
perplexing
to
christians
was
the
fact
when
fulfilled
as
it
was
in
no
long
time
on
a
large
scale
that
three
of
the
early
heresies
more
or
less
originated
in
obstinate
unchristian
refusal
to
readmit
to
the
privileges
of
the
gospel
those
who
had
fallen
into
sin
yet
our
lord
s
words
are
express
he
tells
us
that
many
are
called
few
are
chosen
in
the
parable
of
the
marriage
feast
the
servants
who
are
sent
out
gather
together
all
that
they
found
both
bad
and
good
the
foolish
virgins
had
no
oil
in
their
vessels
amid
the
good
seed
an
enemy
sows
seed
that
is
noxious
or
worthless
and
the
kingdom
is
like
to
a
net
which
gathered
together
all
kind
of
fishes
and
at
the
end
of
the
world
the
angels
shall
go
forth
and
shall
separate
the
wicked
from
among
the
moreover
he
not
only
speaks
of
his
religion
as
destined
to
possess
a
wide
temporal
power
such
that
as
in
the
case
of
the
babylonian
the
birds
of
the
air
should
dwell
in
its
branches
but
he
opens
on
us
the
prospect
of
ambition
and
rivalry
in
its
leading
members
when
he
warns
his
disciples
against
desiring
the
first
places
in
his
kingdom
nay
of
grosser
sins
in
his
description
of
the
ruler
who
began
to
strike
his
and
to
eat
and
drink
and
be
drunken
which
have
an
awful
significance
considering
what
kind
of
men
have
before
now
been
his
chosen
representatives
and
have
sat
in
the
chair
of
his
apostles
if
then
it
be
objected
that
christianity
does
not
as
the
old
prophets
seem
to
promise
abolish
sin
and
irreligion
within
its
pale
we
may
answer
not
only
that
it
did
not
engage
to
do
so
but
that
actually
in
a
prophetical
spirit
it
warned
its
followers
against
the
expectation
of
its
so
doing
according
to
our
lord
s
announcements
before
the
event
christianity
was
to
prevail
and
to
become
a
great
empire
and
to
fill
the
earth
but
it
was
to
accomplish
this
destiny
not
as
other
victorious
powers
had
done
and
as
the
jews
expected
by
force
of
arms
or
by
other
means
of
this
world
but
by
the
novel
expedient
of
sanctity
and
suffering
if
some
aspiring
party
of
this
day
the
great
orleans
family
or
a
branch
of
the
hohenzollern
wishing
to
found
a
kingdom
were
to
profess
as
their
only
weapon
the
practice
of
virtue
they
would
not
startle
us
more
than
it
startled
a
jew
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
to
be
told
that
his
glorious
messiah
was
not
to
fight
like
joshua
or
david
but
simply
to
preach
it
is
indeed
a
thought
so
strange
both
in
its
prediction
and
in
its
fulfilment
as
urgently
to
suggest
to
us
that
some
divine
power
went
with
him
who
conceived
and
proclaimed
it
this
is
what
i
have
been
saying
i
wish
to
consider
the
fact
which
was
predicted
in
itself
without
reference
to
its
being
the
subject
whether
of
a
prediction
or
of
a
fulfilment
that
is
the
history
of
the
rise
and
establishment
of
christianity
and
to
inquire
whether
it
is
a
history
that
admits
of
being
resolved
by
any
philosophical
ingenuity
into
the
ordinary
operation
of
moral
social
or
political
causes
as
is
well
known
various
writers
have
attempted
to
assign
human
causes
in
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
gibbon
especially
has
mentioned
five
viz
the
zeal
of
christians
inherited
from
the
jews
their
doctrine
of
a
future
state
their
claim
to
miraculous
power
their
virtues
and
their
ecclesiastical
organization
let
us
briefly
consider
them
he
thinks
these
five
causes
when
combined
will
fairly
account
for
the
event
but
he
has
not
thought
of
accounting
for
their
combination
if
they
are
ever
so
available
for
his
purpose
still
that
availableness
arises
out
of
their
coincidence
and
out
of
what
does
that
coincidence
arise
until
this
is
explained
nothing
is
explained
and
the
question
had
better
have
been
let
alone
these
presumed
causes
are
quite
distinct
from
each
other
and
i
say
the
wonder
is
what
made
them
come
together
how
came
a
multitude
of
gentiles
to
be
influenced
with
jewish
zeal
how
came
zealots
to
submit
to
a
strict
ecclesiastical
what
connexion
has
a
secular
with
the
immortality
of
the
soul
why
should
immortality
a
philosophical
doctrine
lead
to
belief
in
miracles
which
is
a
superstition
of
the
vulgar
what
tendency
had
miracles
and
magic
to
make
men
austerely
virtuous
lastly
what
power
was
there
in
a
code
of
virtue
as
calm
and
enlightened
as
that
of
antoninus
to
generate
a
zeal
as
fierce
as
that
of
maccabæus
wonderful
events
before
now
have
apparently
been
nothing
but
coincidences
certainly
but
they
do
not
become
less
wonderful
by
cataloguing
their
constituent
causes
unless
we
also
show
how
these
came
to
be
constituent
however
this
by
the
way
the
real
question
is
this
these
historical
characteristics
of
christianity
also
in
matter
of
fact
historical
causes
of
christianity
has
gibbon
given
proof
that
they
are
has
he
brought
evidence
of
their
operation
or
does
he
simply
conjecture
in
his
private
judgment
that
they
operated
whether
they
were
adapted
to
accomplish
a
certain
work
is
a
matter
of
opinion
whether
they
did
accomplish
it
is
a
question
of
fact
he
ought
to
adduce
instances
of
their
efficiency
before
he
has
a
right
to
say
that
they
are
efficient
and
the
second
question
is
what
is
this
effect
of
which
they
are
to
be
considered
as
causes
it
is
no
other
than
this
the
conversion
of
bodies
of
men
to
the
christian
faith
let
us
keep
this
in
view
we
have
to
determine
whether
these
five
characteristics
of
christianity
were
efficient
causes
of
bodies
of
men
becoming
christians
i
think
they
neither
did
effect
such
conversions
nor
were
adapted
to
do
so
and
for
these
reasons
for
first
as
to
zeal
by
which
gibbon
means
party
spirit
or
de
this
doubtless
is
a
motive
principle
when
men
are
already
members
of
a
body
but
does
it
operate
in
bringing
them
into
it
the
jews
were
born
in
judaism
they
had
a
long
and
glorious
history
and
would
naturally
feel
and
show
de
but
how
did
party
spirit
tend
to
transplant
jew
or
gentile
out
of
his
own
place
into
a
new
society
and
that
a
society
which
as
yet
scarcely
was
formed
in
a
society
zeal
certainly
may
be
felt
for
a
cause
or
for
a
person
on
this
point
i
shall
speak
presently
but
gibbon
s
idea
of
christian
zeal
is
nothing
better
than
the
old
wine
of
judaism
decanted
into
new
christian
bottles
and
would
be
too
flat
a
stimulant
even
if
it
admitted
of
such
a
transference
to
be
taken
as
a
cause
of
conversion
to
christianity
without
definite
evidence
in
proof
of
the
fact
christians
had
zeal
for
christianity
after
they
were
converted
not
before
next
as
to
the
doctrine
of
a
future
state
gibbon
seems
to
mean
by
this
doctrine
the
fear
of
hell
now
certainly
in
this
day
there
are
persons
converted
from
sin
to
a
religious
life
by
vivid
descriptions
of
the
future
punishment
of
the
wicked
but
then
it
must
be
recollected
that
such
persons
already
believe
in
the
doctrine
thus
urged
upon
them
on
the
contrary
give
some
tract
upon
to
one
of
the
wild
boys
in
a
large
town
who
has
had
no
education
who
has
no
faith
and
instead
of
being
startled
by
it
he
will
laugh
at
it
as
something
frightfully
ridiculous
the
belief
in
styx
and
tartarus
was
dying
out
of
the
world
at
the
time
that
christianity
came
in
as
the
parallel
belief
now
seems
to
be
dying
out
in
all
classes
of
our
own
society
the
doctrine
of
eternal
punishment
does
only
anger
the
multitude
of
men
in
our
large
towns
now
and
make
them
blaspheme
why
should
it
have
had
any
other
effect
on
the
heathen
populations
in
the
age
when
our
lord
came
yet
it
was
among
those
populations
that
he
and
his
made
their
way
from
the
first
as
to
the
hope
of
eternal
life
that
doubtless
as
well
as
the
fear
of
hell
was
a
most
operative
doctrine
in
the
case
of
men
who
had
been
actually
converted
of
christians
brought
before
the
magistrate
or
writhing
under
torture
but
the
thought
of
eternal
glory
does
not
keep
bad
men
from
a
bad
life
now
and
why
should
it
convert
them
then
from
their
pleasant
sins
to
a
heavy
mortified
joyless
existence
to
a
life
of
fright
contempt
and
desolation
that
the
claim
to
miracles
should
have
any
wide
influence
in
favour
of
christianity
among
heathen
populations
who
had
plenty
of
portents
of
their
own
is
an
opinion
in
curious
contrast
with
the
objection
against
christianity
which
has
provoked
an
answer
from
paley
viz
that
christian
miracles
are
not
recited
or
appealed
to
by
early
christian
writers
themselves
so
fully
or
so
frequently
as
might
have
been
paley
solves
the
difficulty
as
far
as
it
is
a
fact
by
observing
as
i
have
suggested
that
it
was
their
lot
to
contend
with
magical
agency
against
which
the
mere
production
of
these
facts
was
not
sufficient
for
the
convincing
of
their
adversaries
i
do
not
know
he
continues
whether
they
themselves
thought
it
quite
decisive
of
the
a
claim
to
miraculous
power
on
the
part
of
christians
which
was
so
unfrequent
as
to
become
now
an
objection
to
the
fact
of
their
possessing
it
can
hardly
have
been
a
principal
cause
of
their
success
and
how
is
it
possible
to
imagine
with
gibbon
that
what
he
calls
the
sober
and
domestic
virtues
of
christians
their
aversion
to
the
luxury
of
the
age
their
chastity
temperance
and
economy
that
these
dull
qualities
were
persuasives
of
a
nature
to
win
and
melt
the
hard
heathen
heart
in
spite
too
of
the
dreary
prospect
of
the
the
amphitheatre
and
the
stake
did
the
christian
morality
by
its
severe
beauty
make
a
convert
of
gibbon
himself
on
the
contrary
he
bitterly
says
it
was
not
in
this
world
that
the
primitive
christians
were
desirous
of
making
themselves
either
agreeable
or
the
virtue
of
the
primitive
christians
like
that
of
the
first
romans
was
very
frequently
guarded
by
poverty
and
their
gloomy
and
austere
aspect
their
abhorrence
of
the
common
business
and
pleasures
of
life
and
their
frequent
predictions
of
impending
calamities
inspired
the
pagans
with
the
apprehension
of
some
danger
which
would
arise
from
the
new
here
we
have
not
only
gibbon
hating
their
moral
and
social
bearing
but
his
heathen
also
how
then
were
those
heathen
overcome
by
the
amiableness
of
that
which
they
viewed
with
such
disgust
we
have
here
plain
proof
that
the
christian
character
repelled
the
heathen
where
is
the
evidence
that
it
converted
them
lastly
as
to
the
ecclesiastical
organization
this
doubtless
as
time
went
on
was
a
special
characteristic
of
the
new
religion
but
how
could
it
directly
contribute
to
its
extension
of
course
it
gave
it
strength
but
it
did
not
give
it
life
we
are
not
born
of
bones
and
muscles
it
is
one
thing
to
make
conquests
another
to
consolidate
an
empire
it
was
before
constantine
that
christians
made
their
great
conquests
rules
are
for
settled
times
not
for
time
of
war
so
much
is
this
contrast
felt
in
the
catholic
church
now
that
as
is
well
known
in
heathen
countries
and
in
countries
which
have
thrown
off
her
yoke
she
suspends
her
diocesan
administration
and
her
canon
law
and
puts
her
children
under
the
extraordinary
jurisdiction
of
propaganda
this
is
what
i
am
led
to
say
on
gibbon
s
five
causes
i
do
not
deny
that
they
might
have
operated
now
and
then
simon
magus
came
to
christianity
in
order
to
learn
the
craft
of
miracles
and
peregrinus
from
love
of
influence
and
power
but
christianity
made
its
way
not
by
individual
but
by
broad
wholesale
conversions
and
the
question
is
how
they
originated
it
is
very
remarkable
that
it
should
not
have
occurred
to
a
man
of
gibbon
s
sagacity
to
inquire
what
account
the
christians
themselves
gave
of
the
matter
would
it
not
have
been
worth
while
for
him
to
have
let
conjecture
alone
and
to
have
looked
for
facts
instead
why
did
he
not
try
the
hypothesis
of
faith
hope
and
charity
did
he
never
hear
of
repentance
towards
god
and
faith
in
christ
did
he
not
recollect
the
many
words
of
apostles
bishops
apologists
martyrs
all
forming
one
testimony
no
such
thoughts
are
close
upon
him
and
close
upon
the
truth
but
he
can
not
sympathize
with
them
he
can
not
believe
in
them
he
can
not
even
enter
into
them
he
needs
the
due
formation
of
mind
let
us
see
whether
the
facts
of
the
case
do
not
come
out
clear
and
unequivocal
if
we
will
but
have
the
patience
to
endure
them
a
deliverer
of
the
human
race
through
the
jewish
nation
had
been
promised
from
time
immemorial
the
day
came
when
he
was
to
appear
and
he
was
eagerly
expected
moreover
one
actually
did
make
his
appearance
at
that
date
in
palestine
and
claimed
to
be
he
he
left
the
earth
without
apparently
doing
much
for
the
object
of
his
coming
but
when
he
was
gone
his
disciples
took
upon
themselves
to
go
forth
to
preach
to
all
parts
of
the
earth
with
the
object
of
preaching
and
collecting
converts
his
after
a
little
while
they
are
found
wonderfully
to
have
succeeded
large
bodies
of
men
in
various
places
are
to
be
seen
professing
to
be
his
disciples
owning
him
as
their
king
and
continually
swelling
in
number
and
penetrating
into
the
populations
of
the
roman
empire
at
length
they
convert
the
empire
itself
all
this
is
historical
fact
now
we
want
to
know
the
farther
historical
fact
viz
the
cause
of
their
conversion
in
other
words
what
were
the
topics
of
that
preaching
which
was
so
effective
if
we
believe
what
is
told
us
by
the
preachers
and
their
converts
the
answer
is
plain
they
preached
christ
they
called
on
men
to
believe
hope
and
place
their
affections
in
that
deliverer
who
had
come
and
gone
and
the
moral
instrument
by
which
they
persuaded
them
to
do
so
was
a
description
of
the
life
character
mission
and
power
of
that
deliverer
a
promise
of
his
invisible
presence
and
protection
here
and
of
the
vision
and
fruition
of
him
hereafter
from
first
to
last
to
christians
as
to
abraham
he
himself
is
the
centre
and
fulness
of
the
dispensation
they
as
abraham
see
his
day
and
are
a
temporal
sovereign
makes
himself
felt
by
means
of
his
subordinate
administrators
who
bring
his
power
and
will
to
bear
upon
every
individual
of
his
subjects
who
personally
know
him
not
the
universal
deliverer
long
expected
when
he
came
he
too
instead
of
making
and
securing
subjects
by
a
visible
graciousness
or
majesty
departs
is
found
through
his
preachers
to
have
imprinted
the
image
or
idea
of
himself
in
the
minds
of
his
subjects
individually
and
that
image
apprehended
and
worshipped
in
individual
minds
becomes
a
principle
of
association
and
a
real
bond
of
those
subjects
one
with
another
who
are
thus
united
to
the
body
by
being
united
to
that
image
and
moreover
that
image
which
is
their
moral
life
when
they
have
been
already
converted
is
also
the
original
instrument
of
their
conversion
it
is
the
image
of
him
who
fulfils
the
one
great
need
of
human
nature
the
healer
of
its
wounds
the
physician
of
the
soul
this
image
it
is
which
both
creates
faith
and
then
rewards
it
when
we
recognize
this
central
image
as
the
vivifying
idea
both
of
the
christian
body
and
of
individuals
in
it
then
certainly
we
are
able
to
take
into
account
at
least
two
of
gibbon
s
causes
as
having
in
connexion
with
that
idea
some
influence
both
in
making
converts
and
in
strengthening
them
to
persevere
it
was
the
thought
of
christ
not
a
corporate
body
or
a
doctrine
which
inspired
that
zeal
which
the
historian
so
poorly
comprehends
and
it
was
the
thought
of
christ
which
gave
a
life
to
the
promise
of
that
eternity
which
without
him
would
be
in
any
soul
nothing
short
of
an
intolerable
burden
now
a
mental
vision
such
as
this
perhaps
will
be
called
cloudy
fanciful
unintelligible
that
is
in
other
words
miraculous
i
think
it
is
so
how
without
the
hand
of
god
could
a
new
idea
one
and
the
same
enter
at
once
into
myriads
of
men
women
and
children
of
all
ranks
especially
the
lower
and
have
power
to
wean
them
from
their
indulgences
and
sins
and
to
nerve
them
against
the
most
cruel
tortures
and
to
last
in
vigour
as
a
sustaining
influence
for
seven
or
eight
generations
till
it
founded
an
extended
polity
broke
the
obstinacy
of
the
strongest
and
wisest
government
which
the
world
has
ever
seen
and
forced
its
way
from
its
first
caves
and
catacombs
to
the
fulness
of
imperial
power
in
considering
this
subject
i
shall
confine
myself
to
the
proof
as
far
as
my
limits
allow
of
two
points
that
this
thought
or
image
of
christ
was
the
principle
of
conversion
and
of
fellowship
and
next
that
among
the
lower
classes
who
had
no
power
influence
reputation
or
education
lay
its
principal
success
as
to
the
vivifying
idea
this
is
paul
s
account
of
it
i
make
known
to
you
the
gospel
which
i
preached
to
you
which
also
you
have
received
and
wherein
you
stand
by
which
also
you
are
saved
for
i
delivered
to
you
first
of
all
that
which
i
also
received
how
that
christ
died
for
our
sins
according
to
the
scriptures
i
am
the
least
of
the
apostles
but
whether
i
or
they
so
we
preached
and
so
you
it
has
pleased
god
by
the
foolishness
of
preaching
to
save
them
that
we
preach
christ
i
determined
to
know
nothing
among
you
but
jesus
christ
and
him
your
life
is
hid
with
christ
in
god
when
christ
who
is
your
life
shall
appear
then
you
also
shall
appear
with
him
in
i
live
but
now
not
i
but
christ
liveth
in
peter
who
has
been
accounted
the
master
of
a
separate
school
says
the
same
jesus
christ
whom
you
have
not
seen
yet
love
in
whom
you
now
believe
and
shall
and
john
who
is
sometimes
accounted
a
third
master
in
christianity
it
hath
not
yet
appeared
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
to
him
because
we
shall
see
him
as
he
that
their
disciples
followed
them
in
this
sovereign
devotion
to
an
invisible
lord
will
appear
as
i
proceed
and
next
as
to
the
worldly
position
and
character
of
his
disciples
our
lord
in
the
passage
returns
thanks
to
his
heavenly
father
because
he
says
thou
hast
hid
these
things
mysteries
of
his
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
hast
revealed
them
to
little
and
in
accordance
with
this
announcement
paul
says
that
not
many
wise
men
according
to
the
flesh
not
many
mighty
not
many
noble
became
christians
he
indeed
is
one
of
those
few
so
were
others
his
contemporaries
and
as
time
went
on
the
number
of
these
exceptions
increased
so
that
converts
were
found
not
a
few
in
the
high
places
of
the
empire
and
in
the
schools
of
philosophy
and
learning
but
still
the
rule
held
that
the
great
mass
of
christians
were
to
be
found
in
those
classes
which
were
of
no
account
in
the
world
whether
on
the
score
of
rank
or
of
education
we
all
know
this
was
the
case
with
our
lord
and
his
apostles
it
seems
almost
irreverent
to
speak
of
their
temporal
employments
when
we
are
so
simply
accustomed
to
consider
them
in
their
spiritual
associations
but
it
is
profitable
to
remind
ourselves
that
our
lord
himself
was
a
sort
of
smith
and
made
ploughs
and
four
apostles
were
fishermen
one
a
petty
tax
collector
two
husbandmen
and
another
is
said
to
have
been
a
market
gardener
when
peter
and
john
were
brought
before
the
council
they
are
spoken
of
as
being
in
a
secular
point
of
view
illiterate
men
and
of
the
lower
sort
and
thus
they
are
spoken
of
in
a
later
age
by
the
fathers
that
their
converts
were
of
the
same
rank
as
themselves
is
reported
in
their
favour
or
to
their
discredit
by
friends
and
enemies
for
four
centuries
if
a
man
be
educated
says
celsus
in
mockery
let
him
keep
clear
of
us
christians
we
want
no
men
of
wisdom
no
men
of
sense
we
account
all
such
as
evil
no
but
if
there
be
one
who
is
inexperienced
or
stupid
or
untaught
or
a
fool
let
him
come
with
good
they
are
weavers
he
says
elsewhere
shoemakers
fullers
illiterate
fools
fellows
says
trypho
the
greater
part
of
you
says
cæcilius
are
worn
with
want
cold
toil
and
famine
men
collected
from
the
lowest
dregs
of
the
people
ignorant
credulous
women
unpolished
boors
illiterate
ignorant
even
of
the
sordid
arts
of
life
they
do
not
understand
even
civil
matters
how
can
they
understand
divine
they
have
left
their
tongs
mallets
and
anvils
to
preach
about
the
things
of
heaven
says
libanius
they
deceive
women
servants
and
slaves
says
julian
the
author
of
philopatris
speaks
of
them
as
poor
creatures
blocks
withered
old
fellows
men
of
downcast
and
pale
as
to
their
religion
it
had
the
reputation
popularly
according
to
various
fathers
of
being
an
anile
superstition
the
discovery
of
old
women
a
joke
a
madness
an
infatuation
an
absurdity
a
fanaticism
the
fathers
themselves
confirm
these
statements
so
far
as
they
relate
to
the
insignificance
and
ignorance
of
their
brethren
athenagoras
speaks
of
the
virtue
of
their
ignorant
men
mechanics
and
old
they
are
gathered
says
jerome
not
from
the
academy
or
lyceum
but
from
the
low
they
are
whitesmiths
servants
woodmen
men
of
sordid
trades
beggars
says
theodoret
we
are
engaged
in
the
farm
in
the
market
at
the
baths
stables
and
fairs
as
seamen
as
soldiers
as
peasants
as
dealers
says
tertullian
how
came
such
men
to
be
converted
and
being
converted
how
came
such
men
to
overturn
the
world
yet
they
went
forth
from
the
first
conquering
and
to
the
first
manifestation
of
their
formidable
numbers
is
made
just
about
the
time
when
peter
and
paul
suffered
martyrdom
and
was
the
cause
of
a
terrible
persecution
we
have
the
account
of
it
in
tacitus
nero
he
says
to
put
an
end
to
the
common
talk
that
rome
had
been
set
on
fire
by
his
order
imputed
it
to
others
visiting
with
a
refinement
of
punishment
those
detestable
criminals
who
went
by
the
name
of
christians
the
author
of
that
denomination
was
christus
who
had
been
executed
in
tiberius
s
time
by
the
procurator
pontius
pilate
the
pestilent
superstition
checked
for
a
while
burst
out
again
not
only
throughout
judea
the
first
seat
of
the
evil
but
even
throughout
rome
the
centre
both
of
confluence
and
outbreak
of
all
that
is
atrocious
and
disgraceful
from
every
quarter
first
were
arrested
those
who
made
no
secret
of
their
sect
and
by
this
clue
a
vast
multitude
of
others
convicted
not
so
much
of
firing
the
city
as
of
hatred
to
the
human
race
mockery
was
added
to
death
clad
in
skins
of
beasts
they
were
torn
to
pieces
by
dogs
they
were
nailed
up
to
crosses
they
were
made
inflammable
so
that
when
day
failed
they
might
serve
as
lights
hence
guilty
as
they
were
and
deserving
of
exemplary
punishment
they
excited
compassion
as
being
destroyed
not
for
the
public
welfare
but
from
the
cruelty
of
one
the
two
apostles
suffered
and
a
silence
follows
of
a
whole
generation
at
the
end
of
thirty
or
forty
years
pliny
the
friend
of
trajan
as
well
as
of
tacitus
is
sent
as
that
emperor
s
proprætor
into
bithynia
and
is
startled
and
perplexed
by
the
number
influence
and
pertinacity
of
the
christians
whom
he
finds
there
and
in
the
neighbouring
province
of
pontus
he
has
the
opportunity
of
being
far
more
fair
to
them
than
his
friend
the
historian
he
writes
to
trajan
to
know
how
he
ought
to
deal
with
them
and
i
will
quote
some
portions
of
his
letter
he
says
he
does
not
know
how
to
proceed
with
them
as
their
religion
has
not
received
toleration
from
the
state
he
never
was
present
at
any
trial
of
them
he
doubted
whether
the
children
among
them
as
well
as
grown
people
ought
to
be
accounted
as
culprits
whether
recantation
would
set
matters
right
or
whether
they
incurred
punishment
all
the
same
whether
they
were
to
be
punished
merely
because
christians
even
though
no
definite
crime
was
proved
against
them
his
way
had
been
to
examine
them
and
put
questions
to
them
if
they
confessed
the
charge
he
gave
them
one
or
two
chances
threatening
them
with
punishment
then
if
they
persisted
he
gave
orders
for
their
execution
for
he
argues
i
felt
no
doubt
that
whatever
might
be
the
character
of
their
opinions
stubborn
and
inflexible
obstinacy
deserved
punishment
others
there
were
of
a
like
infatuation
whom
being
citizens
i
sent
to
some
satisfied
him
they
repeated
after
him
an
invocation
to
the
gods
and
offered
wine
and
incense
to
the
emperor
s
image
and
in
addition
cursed
the
name
of
christ
accordingly
he
says
i
let
them
go
for
i
am
told
nothing
can
compel
a
real
christian
to
do
any
of
these
there
were
others
too
who
sacrificed
who
had
been
christians
some
of
them
for
as
many
as
twenty
years
then
he
is
curious
to
know
something
more
definite
about
them
this
the
informers
told
me
was
the
whole
of
their
crime
or
mistake
that
they
were
accustomed
to
assemble
on
a
stated
day
before
dawn
and
to
say
together
a
hymn
to
christ
as
a
god
and
to
bind
themselves
by
an
oath
sacramento
not
to
any
crime
but
on
the
contrary
to
keep
from
theft
robbery
adultery
breach
of
promise
and
making
free
with
deposits
after
this
they
used
to
separate
and
then
to
meet
again
for
a
meal
which
was
social
and
harmless
however
they
left
even
that
off
after
my
edict
against
their
this
information
led
him
to
put
to
the
torture
two
who
were
called
ministers
in
order
to
find
out
what
was
true
what
was
false
in
it
but
he
says
he
could
make
out
nothing
except
a
depraved
and
excessive
superstition
this
is
what
led
him
to
consult
the
emperor
especially
because
of
the
number
who
were
implicated
in
it
for
these
are
or
are
likely
to
be
many
of
all
ages
nay
of
both
sexes
for
the
contagion
of
this
superstition
has
spread
not
only
in
the
cities
but
about
the
villages
and
the
open
he
adds
that
already
there
was
some
improvement
the
almost
forsaken
temples
begin
to
be
filled
again
and
the
sacred
solemnities
after
a
long
intermission
are
revived
victims
too
are
again
on
sale
purchasers
having
been
most
rare
to
the
salient
points
in
this
account
are
these
that
at
the
end
of
one
generation
from
the
apostles
nay
almost
in
the
lifetime
of
john
christians
had
so
widely
spread
in
a
large
district
of
asia
as
nearly
to
suppress
the
pagan
religions
there
that
they
were
people
of
exemplary
lives
that
they
had
a
name
for
invincible
fidelity
to
their
religion
that
no
threats
or
sufferings
could
make
them
deny
it
and
that
their
only
tangible
characteristic
was
the
worship
of
our
lord
this
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
century
not
a
great
many
years
after
we
have
another
account
of
the
christian
body
from
an
anonymous
greek
christian
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
whom
he
was
anxious
to
convert
it
is
far
too
long
to
quote
and
difficult
to
compress
but
a
few
sentences
will
show
how
strikingly
it
agrees
with
the
account
of
the
heathen
pliny
especially
in
two
points
in
the
numbers
of
the
christians
secondly
on
devotion
to
our
lord
as
the
vivifying
principle
of
their
association
christians
says
the
writer
differ
not
from
other
men
in
country
or
speech
or
customs
they
do
not
live
in
cities
of
their
own
or
speak
in
any
peculiar
dialect
or
adopt
any
strange
modes
of
living
they
inhabit
their
native
countries
but
as
sojourners
they
take
their
part
in
all
burdens
as
if
citizens
and
in
all
sufferings
as
if
they
were
strangers
in
foreign
countries
they
recognize
a
home
and
in
every
home
they
see
a
foreign
country
they
marry
like
other
men
but
do
not
disown
their
children
they
obey
the
established
laws
but
they
go
beyond
them
in
the
tenor
of
their
lives
they
love
all
men
and
are
persecuted
by
all
they
are
not
known
and
they
are
condemned
they
are
poor
and
make
many
rich
they
are
dishonoured
yet
in
dishonour
they
are
glorified
they
are
slandered
and
they
are
cleared
they
are
called
names
and
they
bless
by
the
jews
they
are
assailed
as
aliens
by
the
greeks
they
are
persecuted
nor
can
they
who
hate
them
say
why
christians
are
in
the
world
as
the
soul
in
the
body
the
soul
pervades
the
limbs
of
the
body
and
christians
the
cities
of
the
world
the
flesh
hates
the
soul
and
wars
against
it
though
suffering
no
wrong
from
it
and
the
world
hates
christians
the
soul
loves
the
flesh
that
hates
it
and
christians
love
their
enemies
their
tradition
is
not
an
earthly
invention
nor
is
it
a
mortal
thought
which
they
so
carefully
guard
nor
a
dispensation
of
human
mysteries
which
is
committed
to
their
charge
but
god
himself
the
omnipotent
and
invisible
creator
has
from
heaven
established
among
men
his
truth
and
his
word
the
holy
and
incomprehensible
and
has
deeply
fixed
the
same
in
their
hearts
not
as
might
be
expected
sending
any
servant
angel
or
prince
or
administrator
of
things
earthly
or
heavenly
but
the
very
artificer
and
demiurge
of
the
universe
him
god
hath
sent
to
man
not
to
inflict
terror
but
in
clemency
and
gentleness
as
a
king
sending
a
king
who
was
his
son
he
sent
him
as
god
to
men
to
save
them
he
hated
not
nor
rejected
us
nor
remembered
our
guilt
but
showed
himself
and
in
his
own
words
bore
our
sins
he
gave
his
own
son
as
a
ransom
for
us
the
just
for
the
unjust
for
what
other
thing
except
his
righteousness
could
cover
our
guilt
in
whom
was
it
possible
for
us
lawless
sinners
to
find
justification
save
in
the
son
of
god
alone
o
sweet
interchange
o
heavenly

the
writing
from

have

quoting
is
of
the
early
part
of
the
second
century
twenty
or
thirty
years
after
it
justin
martyr
speaks
as
strongly
of
the
spread
of
the
new
religion
there
is
not
any
one
race
of
men
he
says
barbarian
or
greek
nay
of
those
who
live
in
waggons
or
who
are
nomads
or
shepherds
in
tents
among
whom
prayers
and
eucharists
are
not
offered
to
the
father
and
maker
of
the
universe
through
the
name
of
the
crucified
towards
the
end
of
the
century
clement
the
word
of
our
master
did
not
remain
in
judea
as
philosophy
remained
in
greece
but
has
been
poured
out
over
the
whole
world
persuading
greeks
and
barbarians
alike
race
by
race
village
by
village
every
city
whole
houses
and
hearers
one
by
one
nay
not
a
few
of
the
philosophers
and
tertullian
at
the
very
close
of
it
could
in
his
even
proceed
to
threaten
the
roman
government
we
are
a
people
of
yesterday
he
says
and
yet
we
have
filled
every
place
belonging
to
you
cities
islands
castles
towns
assemblies
your
very
camp
your
tribes
companies
palaces
senate
forum
we
leave
you
your
temples
only
we
can
count
your
armies
and
our
numbers
in
a
single
province
will
be
greater
in
what
war
with
you
should
we
not
be
sufficient
and
ready
even
though
unequal
in
numbers
who
so
willingly
are
put
to
death
if
it
were
not
in
this
religion
of
ours
more
lawful
to
be
slain
than
to
slay
once
more
let
us
hear
the
great
origen
in
the
early
part
of
the
next
century
in
all
greece
and
in
all
barbarous
races
within
our
world
there
are
tens
of
thousands
who
have
left
their
national
laws
and
customary
gods
for
the
law
of
moses
and
the
word
of
jesus
christ
though
to
adhere
to
that
law
is
to
incur
the
hatred
of
idolaters
and
the
risk
of
death
besides
to
have
embraced
that
word
and
considering
how
in
so
few
years
in
spite
of
the
attacks
made
on
us
to
the
loss
of
life
or
property
and
with
no
great
store
of
teachers
the
preaching
of
that
word
has
found
its
way
into
every
part
of
the
world
so
that
greek
and
barbarians
wise
and
unwise
adhere
to
the
religion
of
jesus
doubtless
it
is
a
work
greater
than
any
work
of
we
need
no
proof
to
assure
us
that
this
steady
and
rapid
growth
of
christianity
was
a
phenomenon
which
startled
its
contemporaries
as
much
as
it
excites
the
curiosity
of
philosophic
historians
now
and
they
too
then
had
their
own
ways
of
accounting
for
it
different
indeed
from
gibbon
s
but
quite
as
pertinent
though
less
elaborate
these
were
principally
two
both
leading
them
to
persecute
it
obstinacy
of
the
christians
and
their
magical
powers
of
which
the
former
was
the
explanation
adopted
by
educated
minds
and
the
latter
chiefly
by
the
populace
as
to
the
former
from
first
to
last
men
in
power
magisterially
reprobate
the
senseless
obstinacy
of
the
members
of
the
new
sect
as
their
characteristic
offence
pliny
as
we
have
seen
found
it
to
be
their
only
fault
but
one
sufficient
to
merit
capital
punishment
the
emperor
marcus
seems
to
consider
obstinacy
the
ultimate
to
which
their
unnatural
conduct
was
traceable
after
speaking
of
the
soul
as
ready
if
it
must
now
be
separated
from
the
body
to
be
extinguished
or
dissolved
or
to
remain
with
it
he
adds
but
the
readiness
must
come
of
its
own
judgment
not
from
simple
perverseness
as
in
the
case
of
christians
but
with
considerateness
with
gravity
and
without
theatrical
effect
so
as
to
be
and
diocletian
in
his
edict
of
persecution
professes
it
to
be
his
earnest
aim
to
punish
the
depraved
persistence
of
those
most
wicked
as
to
the
latter
charge
their
founder
it
was
said
had
gained
a
knowledge
of
magic
in
egypt
and
had
left
behind
him
in
his
sacred
books
the
secrets
of
the
art
suetonius
himself
speaks
of
them
as
men
of
a
magical
superstition
and
celsus
accuses
them
of
incantations
in
the
name
of
the
officer
who
had
custody
of
perpetua
feared
her
escape
from
prison
by
magical
when
tiburtius
had
walked
barefoot
on
hot
coals
his
judge
cried
out
that
christ
had
taught
him
magic
anastasia
was
thrown
into
prison
as
dealing
in
poisons
the
populace
called
out
against
agnes
away
with
the
witch
away
with
the
sorceress
when
bonosus
and
maximilian
bore
the
burning
pitch
without
shrinking
jews
and
heathen
cried
out
those
wizards
and
sorcerers
what
new
delusion
says
the
magistrate
concerning
romanus
in
the
hymn
of
prudentius
has
brought
in
these
sophists
who
deny
the
worship
of
the
gods
how
doth
this
chief
sorcerer
mock
us
stilled
by
his
thessalian
charm
to
laugh
at
punishment
it
is
indeed
difficult
to
enter
into
the
feelings
of
irritation
and
fear
of
contempt
and
amazement
which
were
excited
whether
in
the
town
populace
or
in
the
magistrates
in
the
presence
of
conduct
so
novel
so
unvarying
so
absolutely
beyond
their
comprehension
the
very
young
and
the
very
old
the
child
the
youth
in
the
heyday
of
his
passions
the
sober
man
of
middle
age
maidens
and
mothers
of
families
boors
and
slaves
as
well
as
philosophers
and
nobles
solitary
confessors
and
companies
of
men
and
women
these
were
seen
equally
to
defy
the
powers
of
darkness
to
do
their
worst
in
this
strange
encounter
it
became
a
point
of
honour
with
the
roman
to
break
the
determination
of
his
victim
and
it
was
the
triumph
of
faith
when
his
most
savage
expedients
for
that
purpose
were
found
to
be
in
vain
the
martyrs
shrank
from
suffering
like
other
men
but
such
natural
shrinking
was
incommensurable
with
apostasy
no
intensity
of
torture
had
any
means
of
affecting
what
was
a
mental
conviction
and
the
sovereign
thought
in
which
they
had
lived
was
their
adequate
support
and
consolation
in
their
death
to
them
the
prospect
of
wounds
and
loss
of
limbs
was
not
more
terrible
than
it
is
to
the
combatant
of
this
world
they
faced
the
implements
of
torture
as
the
soldier
takes
his
post
before
the
enemy
s
battery
they
cheered
and
ran
forward
to
meet
his
attack
and
as
it
were
dared
him
if
he
would
to
destroy
the
numbers
who
kept
closing
up
the
foremost
rank
as
their
comrades
who
had
filled
it
fell
and
when
rome
at
last
found
she
had
to
deal
with
a
host
of
scævolas
then
the
proudest
of
earthly
sovereignties
arrayed
in
the
completeness
of
her
material
resources
humbled
herself
before
a
power
which
was
founded
on
a
mere
sense
of
the
unseen
in
the
colloquy
of
the
aged
ignatius
the
disciple
of
the
apostles
with
the
emperor
trajan
we
have
a
sort
of
type
of
what
went
on
for
three
or
rather
four
centuries
he
was
sent
all
the
way
from
antioch
to
rome
to
be
devoured
by
the
beasts
in
the
amphitheatre
as
he
travelled
he
wrote
letters
to
various
christian
churches
and
among
others
to
his
roman
brethren
among
whom
he
was
to
suffer
let
us
see
whether
as
i
have
said
the
image
of
that
divine
king
who
had
been
promised
from
the
beginning
was
not
the
living
principle
of
his
obstinate
resolve
the
old
man
is
almost
fierce
in
his
determination
to
be
martyred
may
those
beasts
he
says
to
his
brethren
be
my
gain
which
are
in
readiness
for
me
i
will
provoke
and
coax
them
to
devour
me
quickly
and
not
to
be
afraid
of
me
as
they
are
of
some
whom
they
will
not
touch
should
they
be
unwilling
i
will
compel
them
bear
with
me
i
know
what
is
my
gain
now
i
begin
to
be
a
disciple
of
nothing
of
things
visible
or
invisible
am
i
ambitious
save
to
gain
christ
whether
it
is
fire
or
the
cross
the
assault
of
wild
beasts
the
wrenching
of
my
bones
the
crunching
of
my
limbs
the
crushing
of
my
whole
body
let
the
tortures
of
the
devil
all
assail
me
if
i
do
but
gain
christ
elsewhere
in
the
same
epistle
he
says
i
write
to
you
still
alive
but
longing
to
die
my
love
is
crucified
i
have
no
taste
for
perishable
food
i
long
for
god
s
bread
heavenly
bread
bread
of
life
which
is
flesh
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
i
long
for
god
s
draught
his
blood
which
is
love
without
corruption
and
life
for
it
is
said
that
when
he
came
into
the
presence
of
trajan
the
latter
cried
out
who
are
you
poor
devil
who
are
so
eager
to
transgress
our
rules
that
is
no
name
he
answered
for
who
is
theophorus
asked
the
emperor
he
who
bears
christ
in
his
in
the
apostle
s
words
already
cited
he
had
christ
in
him
the
hope
of
all
this
may
be
called
enthusiasm
but
enthusiasm
affords
a
much
more
adequate
explanation
of
the
confessorship
of
an
old
man
than
do
gibbon
s
five
reasons
instances
of
the
same
ardent
spirit
and
of
the
living
faith
on
which
it
was
founded
are
to
be
found
wherever
we
open
the
in
the
outbreak
at
smyrna
in
the
middle
of
the
second
century
amid
tortures
which
even
moved
the
heathen
bystanders
to
compassion
the
sufferers
were
conspicuous
for
their
serene
calmness
they
made
it
evident
to
us
all
says
the
epistle
of
the
church
that
in
the
midst
of
those
sufferings
they
were
absent
from
the
body
or
rather
that
the
lord
stood
by
them
and
walked
in
the
midst
of
at
that
time
polycarp
the
familiar
friend
of
john
and
a
contemporary
of
ignatius
suffered
in
his
extreme
old
age
when
before
his
sentence
the
proconsul
bade
him
swear
by
the
fortunes
of
cæsar
and
have
done
with
christ
his
answer
betrayed
that
intimate
devotion
to
the
idea
which
had
been
the
inward
life
of
ignatius
eighty
and
six
years
he
answered
have
i
been
his
servant
and
he
has
never
wronged
me
but
ever
has
preserved
me
and
how
can
i
blaspheme
my
king
and
my
saviour
when
they
would
have
fastened
him
to
the
stake
he
said
let
alone
he
who
gives
me
to
bear
the
fire
will
give
me
also
to
stand
firm
upon
the
pyre
without
your
christians
felt
it
as
an
acceptable
service
to
him
who
loved
them
to
confess
with
courage
and
to
suffer
with
dignity
in
this
chivalrous
spirit
as
it
may
be
called
they
met
the
words
and
deeds
of
their
persecutors
as
the
children
of
men
return
bitterness
for
bitterness
and
blow
for
blow
what
soldier
says
minucius
with
a
reference
to
the
invisible
presence
of
our
lord
does
not
challenge
danger
more
daringly
under
the
eye
of
his
commander
in
that
same
outbreak
at
smyrna
when
the
proconsul
urged
the
young
germanicus
to
have
mercy
on
himself
and
on
his
youth
to
the
astonishment
of
the
populace
he
provoked
a
wild
beast
to
fall
upon
him
in
like
manner
justin
tells
us
of
lucius
who
when
he
saw
a
christian
sent
off
to
suffer
at
once
remonstrated
sharply
with
the
judge
and
was
sent
off
to
execution
with
him
and
then
another
presented
himself
and
was
sent
off
also
when
the
christians
were
thrown
into
prison
in
the
fierce
persecution
at
lyons
vettius
epagathus
a
youth
of
distinction
who
had
given
himself
to
an
ascetic
life
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
the
sufferings
of
his
brethren
and
asked
leave
to
plead
their
cause
the
only
answer
he
got
was
to
be
sent
off
the
first
to
die
what
the
contemporary
account
sees
in
his
conduct
is
not
that
he
was
zealous
for
his
brethren
though
zealous
he
was
nor
that
he
believed
in
miracles
though
he
doubtless
did
believe
but
that
he
was
a
gracious
disciple
of
christ
following
the
lamb
whithersoever
he
in
that
memorable
persecution
when
blandina
a
slave
was
seized
for
confessorship
her
mistress
and
her
dreaded
lest
from
her
delicate
make
she
should
give
way
under
the
torments
but
she
even
tired
out
her
tormentors
it
was
a
refreshment
and
relief
to
her
to
cry
out
amid
her
pains
i
am
a
they
remanded
her
to
prison
and
then
brought
her
out
for
fresh
suffering
a
second
day
and
a
third
on
the
last
day
she
saw
a
boy
of
fifteen
brought
into
the
amphitheatre
for
death
she
feared
for
him
as
others
had
feared
for
her
but
he
too
went
through
his
trial
generously
and
went
to
god
before
her
her
last
sufferings
were
to
be
placed
in
the
notorious
chair
and
then
to
be
exposed
in
a
net
to
a
wild
bull
they
finished
by
cutting
her
throat
sanctus
too
when
the
burning
plates
of
brass
were
placed
on
his
limbs
all
through
his
torments
did
but
say
i
am
a
christian
and
stood
erect
and
firm
bathed
and
strengthened
say
his
brethren
who
write
the
account
in
the
heavenly
well
of
living
water
which
flows
from
the
breast
of
christ
or
as
they
say
elsewhere
of
all
the
martyrs
refreshed
with
the
joy
of
martyrdom
the
hope
of
blessedness
love
towards
christ
and
the
spirit
of
god
the
how
clearly
do
we
see
all
through
this
narrative
what
it
was
which
nerved
them
for
the
combat
if
they
love
their
brethren
it
is
in
the
fellowship
of
their
lord
if
they
look
for
heaven
it
is
because
he
is
the
light
of
it
epipodius
a
youth
of
gentle
nurture
when
struck
by
the
prefect
on
the
mouth
while
blood
flowed
from
it
cried
out
i
confess
that
jesus
christ
is
god
together
with
the
father
and
the
holy
symphorian
of
autun
also
a
youth
and
of
noble
birth
when
told
to
adore
an
idol
answered
give
me
leave
and
i
will
hammer
it
to
when
leonidas
the
father
of
the
young
origen
was
in
prison
for
his
faith
the
boy
then
seventeen
burned
to
share
his
martyrdom
and
his
mother
had
to
hide
his
clothes
to
prevent
him
from
executing
his
purpose
afterwards
he
attended
the
confessors
in
prison
stood
by
them
at
the
tribunal
and
gave
them
the
kiss
of
peace
when
they
were
led
out
to
suffer
and
this
in
spite
of
being
several
times
apprehended
and
put
upon
the
rack
also
in
alexandria
the
beautiful
slave
potamiæna
when
about
to
be
stripped
in
order
to
be
thrown
into
the
cauldron
of
hot
pitch
said
to
the
prefect
i
pray
you
rather
let
me
be
dipped
down
slowly
into
it
with
my
clothes
on
and
you
shall
see
with
what
patience
i
am
gifted
by
him
of
whom
you
are
ignorant
jesus
when
the
populace
in
the
same
city
had
beaten
out
the
aged
apollonia
s
teeth
and
lit
a
fire
to
burn
her
unless
she
would
blaspheme
she
leaped
into
the
fire
herself
and
so
gained
her
crown
when
sixtus
bishop
of
rome
was
led
to
martyrdom
his
deacon
laurence
followed
him
weeping
and
complaining
o
my
father
whither
goest
thou
without
thy
son
and
when
his
own
turn
came
three
days
afterwards
and
he
was
put
upon
the
gridiron
after
a
while
he
said
to
the
prefect
turn
me
this
side
is
whence
came
this
tremendous
spirit
scaring
nay
offending
the
fastidious
criticism
of
our
delicate
days
does
gibbon
think
to
sound
the
depths
of
the
eternal
ocean
with
the
tape
and
of
his
merely
literary
philosophy
when
barulas
a
child
of
seven
years
old
was
scourged
to
blood
for
repeating
his
catechism
before
the
heathen
there
is
but
one
god
and
jesus
christ
is
true
god
mother
encouraged
him
to
persevere
chiding
him
for
asking
for
some
drink
at
merida
a
girl
of
noble
family
of
the
age
of
twelve
presented
herself
before
the
tribunal
and
overturned
the
idols
she
was
scourged
and
burned
with
torches
she
neither
shed
a
tear
nor
showed
other
signs
of
suffering
when
the
fire
reached
her
face
she
opened
her
mouth
to
receive
it
and
was
suffocated
at
cæsarea
a
girl
under
eighteen
went
boldly
to
ask
the
prayers
of
some
christians
who
were
in
chains
before
the
prætorium
she
was
seized
at
once
and
her
sides
torn

and
joyous

peter
dorotheus
gorgonius
were
boys
of
the
imperial
bedchamber
they
were
highly
in
favour
with
their
masters
and
were
christians
they
too
suffered
dreadful
torments
dying
under
them
without
a
shadow
of
wavering
call
such
conduct
madness
if
you
will
or
magic
but
do
not
mock
us
by
ascribing
it
in
such
mere
children
to
simple
desire
of
immortality
or
to
any
ecclesiastical
organization
when
the
persecution
raged
in
asia
a
vast
multitude
of
christians
presented
themselves
before
the
proconsul
challenging
him
to
proceed
against
them
poor
wretches
half
in
contempt
and
half
in
affright
he
answered
if
you
must
die
can
not
you
find
ropes
or
precipices
for
the
purpose
at
utica
a
hundred
and
fifty
christians
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
were
martyrs
in
one
company
they
are
said
to
have
been
told
to
burn
incense
to
an
idol
or
they
should
be
thrown
into
a
pit
of
burning
lime
they
without
hesitation
leapt
into
it
in
egypt
a
hundred
and
twenty
confessors
after
having
sustained
the
loss
of
eyes
or
of
feet
endured
to
linger
out
their
lives
in
the
mines
of
palestine
and
cilicia
in
the
last
persecution
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
grave
eusebius
a
contemporary
the
slaughter
of
men
women
and
children
went
on
by
twenties
sixties
hundreds
till
the
instruments
of
execution
were
worn
out
and
the
executioners
could
kill
no
more
yet
he
tells
us
as
an
that
as
soon
as
any
christians
were
condemned
others
ran
from
all
parts
and
surrounded
the
tribunals
confessing
the
faith
and
joyfully
receiving
their
condemnation
and
singing
songs
of
thanksgiving
and
triumph
to
the
last
thus
was
the
roman
power
overcome
thus
did
the
seed
of
abraham
and
the
expectation
of
the
gentiles
the
meek
son
of
man
take
to
himself
his
great
power
and
reign
in
the
hearts
of
his
people
in
the
public
theatre
of
the
world
the
mode
in
which
the
primeval
prophecy
was
fulfilled
is
as
marvellous
as
the
prophecy
itself
is
clear
and
bold
so
may
all
thy
enemies
perish
o
lord
but
let
them
that
love
thee
shine
as
the
sun
shineth
in
his
rising
i
will
add
the
memorable
words
of
the
two
great
apologists
of
the
period
your
cruelty
says
tertullian
though
each
act
be
more
refined
than
the
last
doth
profit
you
nothing
to
our
sect
it
is
rather
an
inducement
we
grow
up
in
greater
numbers
as
often
as
you
cut
us
down
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
is
their
seed
for
the
origen
even
uses
the
language
of
prophecy
to
the
objection
of
celsus
that
christianity
from
its
principles
would
if
let
alone
open
the
whole
empire
to
the
irruption
of
the
barbarians
and
the
utter
ruin
of
civilization
he
replies
if
all
romans
are
such
as
we
then
too
the
barbarians
will
draw
near
to
the
word
of
god
and
will
become
the
most
observant
of
the
law
and
every
worship
shall
come
to
nought
and
that
of
the
christians
alone
obtain
the
mastery
for
the
word
is
continually
gaining
possession
of
more
and
more
one
additional
remark
was
fitting
that
those
mixed
unlettered
multitudes
who
for
three
centuries
had
suffered
and
triumphed
by
virtue
of
the
inward
vision
of
their
divine
lord
should
be
selected
as
we
know
they
were
in
the
fourth
to
be
the
special
champions
of
his
divinity
and
the
victorious
foes
of
its
impugners
at
a
time
when
the
civil
power
which
had
found
them
too
strong
for
its
arms
attempted
by
means
of
a
portentous
heresy
in
the
high
places
of
the
church
to
rob
them
of
that
truth
which
had
all
along
been
the
principle
of
their
strength
i
have
been
forestalling
all
along
the
thought
with
which
i
shall
close
these
considerations
on
the
subject
of
christianity
and
necessarily
forestalling
it
because
it
properly
comes
first
though
the
course
which
my
argument
has
taken
has
not
allowed
me
to
introduce
it
in
its
natural
place
revelation
begins
where
natural
religion
fails
the
religion
of
nature
is
a
mere
inchoation
and
needs
a
complement
can
have
but
one
complement
and
that
very
complement
is
christianity
natural
religion
is
based
upon
the
sense
of
sin
it
recognizes
the
disease
but
it
can
not
find
it
does
but
look
out
for
the
remedy
that
remedy
both
for
guilt
and
for
moral
impotence
is
found
in
the
central
doctrine
of
revelation
the
mediation
of
christ
i
need
not
go
into
a
subject
so
familiar
to
all
men
in
a
christian
country
thus
it
is
that
christianity
is
the
fulfilment
of
the
promise
made
to
abraham
and
of
the
mosaic
revelations
this
is
how
it
has
been
able
from
the
first
to
occupy
the
world
and
gain
a
hold
on
every
class
of
human
society
to
which
its
preachers
reached
this
is
why
the
roman
power
and
the
multitude
of
religions
which
it
embraced
could
not
stand
against
it
this
is
the
secret
of
its
sustained
energy
and
its
martyrdoms
this
is
how
at
present
it
is
so
mysteriously
potent
in
spite
of
the
new
and
fearful
adversaries
which
beset
its
path
it
has
with
it
that
gift
of
staunching
and
healing
the
one
deep
wound
of
human
nature
which
avails
more
for
its
success
than
a
full
encyclopedia
of
scientific
knowledge
and
a
whole
library
of
controversy
and
therefore
it
must
last
while
human
nature
lasts
it
is
a
living
truth
which
never
can
grow
old
some
persons
speak
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
thing
of
history
with
only
indirect
bearings
upon
modern
times
i
can
not
allow
that
it
is
a
mere
historical
religion
certainly
it
has
its
foundations
in
past
and
glorious
memories
but
its
power
is
in
the
present
it
is
no
dreary
matter
of
antiquarianism
we
do
not
contemplate
it
in
conclusions
drawn
from
dumb
documents
and
dead
events
but
by
faith
exercised
in
objects
and
by
the
appropriation
and
use
of
gifts
our
communion
with
it
is
in
the
unseen
not
in
the
obsolete
at
this
very
day
its
rites
and
ordinances
are
continually
eliciting
the
active
interposition
of
that
omnipotence
in
which
the
religion
long
ago
began
first
and
above
all
is
the
holy
mass
in
which
he
who
once
died
for
us
upon
the
cross
brings
back
and
perpetuates
by
his
literal
presence
in
it
that
one
and
the
same
sacrifice
which
can
not
be
repeated
next
there
is
the
actual
entrance
of
himself
soul
and
body
and
divinity
into
the
soul
and
body
of
every
worshipper
who
comes
to
him
for
the
gift
a
privilege
more
intimate
than
if
we
lived
with
him
during
his
sojourn
upon
earth
and
then
moreover
there
is
his
personal
abidance
in
our
churches
raising
earthly
service
into
a
foretaste
of
heaven
such
is
the
profession
of
christianity
and
i
repeat
its
very
divination
of
our
needs
is
in
itself
a
proof
that
it
is
really
the
supply
of
them
upon
the
doctrines
which
i
have
mentioned
as
central
truths
others
as
we
all
know
follow
which
rule
our
personal
conduct
and
course
of
life
and
our
social
and
civil
relations
the
promised
deliverer
the
expectation
of
the
nations
has
not
done
his
work
by
halves
he
has
given
us
saints
and
angels
for
our
protection
he
has
taught
us
how
by
our
prayers
and
services
to
benefit
our
departed
friends
and
to
keep
up
a
memorial
of
ourselves
when
we
are
gone
he
has
created
a
visible
hierarchy
and
a
succession
of
sacraments
to
be
the
channels
of
his
mercies
and
the
crucifix
secures
the
thought
of
him
in
every
house
and
chamber
in
all
these
ways
he
brings
himself
before
us
i
am
not
here
speaking
of
his
gifts
as
gifts
but
as
memorials
not
as
what
christians
know
they
convey
but
in
their
visible
character
and
i
say
that
as
human
nature
itself
is
still
in
life
and
action
as
much
as
ever
it
was
so
he
too
lives
to
our
imaginations
by
his
visible
symbols
as
if
he
were
on
earth
with
a
practical
efficacy
which
even
unbelievers
can
not
deny
to
be
the
corrective
of
that
nature
and
its
strength
day
by
day
and
that
this
power
of
perpetuating
his
image
being
altogether
singular
and
special
and
the
prerogative
of
him
and
him
alone
is
a
grand
evidence
how
well
he
fulfils
to
this
day
that
sovereign
mission
which
from
the
first
beginning
of
the
world
s
history
has
been
in
prophecy
assigned
to
him
i
can
not
better
illustrate
this
argument
than
by
recurring
to
a
deep
thought
on
the
subject
of
christianity
which
has
before
now
attracted
the
notice
of
philosophers
and
preachers
as
coming
from
the
wonderful
man
who
swayed
the
destinies
of
europe
in
the
first
years
of
this
century
it
was
an
argument
not
unnatural
in
one
who
had
that
special
passion
for
human
glory
which
has
been
the
incentive
of
so
many
heroic
careers
and
of
so
many
mighty
revolutions
in
the
history
of
the
world
in
the
solitude
of
his
imprisonment
and
in
the
view
of
death
he
is
said
to
have
expressed
himself
to
the
following
effect
i
have
been
accustomed
to
put
before
me
the
examples
of
alexander
and
cæsar
with
the
hope
of
rivalling
their
exploits
and
living
in
the
minds
of
men
for
ever
yet
after
all
in
what
sense
does
cæsar
in
what
sense
does
alexander
live
who
knows
or
cares
anything
about
them
at
best
nothing
but
their
names
is
known
for
who
among
the
multitude
of
men
who
hear
or
who
utter
their
names
really
knows
anything
about
their
lives
or
their
deeds
or
attaches
to
those
names
any
definite
idea
nay
even
their
names
do
but
flit
up
and
down
the
world
like
ghosts
mentioned
only
on
particular
occasions
or
from
accidental
associations
their
chief
home
is
the
schoolroom
they
have
a
foremost
place
in
boys
grammars
and
they
are
splendid
examples
for
themes
they
form
so
low
is
heroic
alexander
fallen
so
low
is
imperial
cæsar
ut
pueris
placeant
et
declamatio
but
on
the
contrary
he
is
reported
to
have
continued
there
is
just
one
name
in
the
whole
world
that
lives
it
is
the
name
of
one
who
passed
his
years
in
obscurity
and
who
died
a
malefactor
s
death
eighteen
hundred
years
have
gone
since
that
time
but
still
it
has
its
hold
upon
the
human
mind
it
has
possessed
the
world
and
it
maintains
possession
amid
the
most
varied
nations
under
the
most
diversified
circumstances
in
the
most
cultivated
in
the
rudest
races
and
intellects
in
all
classes
of
society
the
owner
of
that
great
name
reigns
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
acknowledge
him
millions
of
souls
are
conversing
with
him
are
venturing
on
his
word
are
looking
for
his
presence
palaces
sumptuous
innumerable
are
raised
to
his
honour
his
image
as
in
the
hour
of
his
deepest
humiliation
is
triumphantly
displayed
in
the
proud
city
in
the
open
country
in
the
corners
of
streets
on
the
tops
of
mountains
it
sanctifies
the
ancestral
hall
the
closet
and
the
bedchamber
it
is
the
subject
for
the
exercise
of
the
highest
genius
in
the
imitative
arts
it
is
worn
next
the
heart
in
life
it
is
held
before
the
failing
eyes
in
death
here
then
is
one
who
is
a
mere
name
who
is
not
a
mere
fiction
who
is
a
reality
he
is
dead
and
gone
but
still
he
lives
as
the
living
energetic
thought
of
successive
generations
as
the
awful
of
a
thousand
great
events
he
has
done
without
effort
what
others
with
struggles
have
not
done
can
he
be
less
than
divine
who
is
he
but
the
creator
himself
who
is
sovereign
over
his
own
works
towards
whom
our
eyes
and
hearts
turn
instinctively
because
he
is
our
father
and
our
god
here
i
end
my
specimens
among
the
many
which
might
be
given
of
the
arguments
adducible
for
christianity
i
have
dwelt
upon
them
in
order
to
show
how
i
would
apply
the
principles
of
this
essay
to
the
proof
of
its
divine
origin
christianity
is
addressed
both
as
regards
its
evidences
and
its
contents
to
minds
which
are
in
the
normal
condition
of
human
nature
as
believing
in
god
and
in
a
future
judgment
such
minds
it
addresses
both
through
the
intellect
and
through
the
imagination
creating
a
certitude
of
its
truth
by
arguments
too
various
for
enumeration
too
personal
and
deep
for
words
too
powerful
and
concurrent
for
refutation
nor
need
reason
come
first
and
faith
second
though
this
is
the
logical
order
but
one
and
the
same
teaching
is
in
different
aspects
both
object
and
proof
and
elicits
one
complex
act
both
of
inference
and
of
assent
it
speaks
to
us
one
by
one
and
it
is
received
by
us
one
by
one
as
the
counterpart
so
to
say
of
ourselves
and
is
real
as
we
are
real
in
the
sacred
words
of
its
divine
author
and
object
concerning
himself
i
am
the
good
shepherd
and
i
know
mine
and
mine
know
me
my
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
i
know
them
and
they
follow
me
and
i
give
them
everlasting
life
and
they
shall
never
perish
and
no
man
shall
pluck
them
out
of
my
note
on
the
first
publication
of
this
volume
a
correspondent
did
me
the
favour
of
marking
for
me
a
list
of
passages
in
chillingworth
s
celebrated
work
besides
that
which
i
had
myself
quoted
in
which
the
argument
was
more
or
less
brought
forward
on
which
i
have
animadverted
in
ch
vii
he
did
this
with
the
purpose
of
showing
that
chillingworth
s
meaning
when
carefully
inquired
into
would
be
found
to
be
in
substantial
agreement
with
the
distinction
i
had
myself
made
between
infallibility
and
certitude
those
inaccuracies
of
language
into
which
he
fell
being
necessarily
involved
in
the
ad
which
he
was
urging
upon
his
opponent
or
being
the
accidental
result
of
the
peculiar
character
of
his
intellect
which
while
full
of
ideas
was
wanting
in
the
calmness
and
caution
which
are
conspicuous
in
bishop
butler
others
more
familiar
with
chillingworth
than
i
am
must
decide
on
this
point
but
i
can
have
no
indisposition
to
accept
an
explanation
which
deprives
controversialists
of
this
day
of
the
authority
of
a
vigorous
and
acute
mind
in
their
use
of
an
argument
which
is
certainly
founded
on
a
great
confusion
of
thought
i
subjoin
the
references
with
which
my
correspondent
has
supplied
me
passages
tending
to
show
an
agreement
of
chillingworth
s
opinion
on
the
distinction
between
certitude
and
infallibility
with
that
laid
down
in
the
foregoing
essay

not

principles
also
i
have
to
express
my
obligation
to
another
correspondent
who
called
my
attention
to
a
passage
of
hooker
eccles
ii
beginning
an
earnest
desire
which
seemed
to
anticipate
the
doctrine
of
locke
about
certitude
it
is
so
difficult
to
be
sure
of
the
meaning
of
a
writer
whose
style
is
so
foreign
to
that
of
our
own
times
that
i
am
shy
of
attempting
to

this
passage

statements
else
i
should
ask
does
not
hooker
here
assume
the
absolute
certainty
of
the
inspiration
and
divine
authority
of
scripture
and
believe
its
teaching
as
the
very
truth
unconditionally
and
without
any
admixture
of
doubt
yet
what
had
he
but
probable
evidence
as
a
warrant
for
such
a
view
of
it
again
did
he
receive
the
athanasian
creed
on
any
logical
demonstration
that
its
articles
were
in
scripture
yet
he
felt
himself
able
without
any
misgiving
to
say
aloud
in
the
congregation
which
faith
except
every
one
do
keep
whole
and
undefiled
he
shall
perish
in
truth
it
is
the
happy
inconsistency
of
his
school
to
be
more
orthodox
in
their
conclusions
than
in
their
premisses
to
be
sceptics
in
their
paper
theories
and
believers
in
their
own
persons
also
a
friend
sends
me
word
as
regards
the
controversy
on
the
various
readings
of
shakespeare
to
which
i
have
referred
ch
viii
in
illustration
of
the
shortcomings
of
formal
inference
that
since
the
date
of
the
article
in
the
magazine
of
which
i
have
there
availed
myself
the
verdict
of
critics
has
been
unfavourable
to
the
authority
and
value
of
the

i
may
add
that
since

of

note
at
the
end
of
the
volume
i
have
assumed
throughout
this
section
that
all
verbal
argumentation
is
ultimately
syllogistic
and
in
consequence
that
it
ever
requires
universal
propositions
and
comes
short
of
concrete
fact
a
friend
refers
me
to
the
dispute
between
des
cartes
and
gassendi
the
latter
maintaining
against
the
former
that
cogito
ergo
sum
implies
the
universal
all
who
think
i
should
deny
this
with
des
cartes
but
i
should
say
as
indeed
he
said
that
his
dictum
was
not
an
argument
but
was
the
expression
of
a
ratiocinative
instinct
as
i
explain
below
under
the
head
of
natural
as
to
the
instance
brutes
are
not
men
therefore
men
are
not
brutes
there
seems
to
me
no
consequence
here
neither
a
nor
a
but
a
tautology
and
as
to
it
was
either
tom
or
dick
that
did
it
it
was
not
dick
ergo
this
may
be
referred
to
the
one
great
principle
on
which
all
logical
reasoning
is
founded
but
really
it
ought
not
to
be
accounted
an
inference
any
more
than
if
i
broke
a
biscuit
flung
half
away
and
then
said
of
the
other
half
this
is
what
it
does
but
state
a
fact
so
when
the
or
proposition
of
euclid
ii
is
put
before
the
eyes
in
a
diagram
a
boy
before
he
yet
has
learned
to
reason
sees
with
his
eyes
the
fact
of
the
thesis
and
this
it
even
makes
it
difficult
for
him
to
master
the
mathematical
proof
