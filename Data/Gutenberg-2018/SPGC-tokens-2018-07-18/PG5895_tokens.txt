listen
john
i
hear
music
the
words
came
in
a
gentle
whisper
from
the
woman
lips
one
white
thin
hand
lifted
itself
weakly
to
the
rough
face
of
the
man
who
was
kneeling
beside
her
bed
and
the
great
dark
eyes
from
which
he
had
hidden
his
own
grew
luminously
bright
for
a
moment
as
she
whispered
again
john
i
hear
music
a
sigh
fluttered
from
her
lips
the
man
head
drooped
until
it
rested
very
near
to
her
bosom
he
felt
the
quiver
of
her
hand
against
his
cheek
and
in
its
touch
there
was
something
which
told
john
cummins
that
the
end
of
all
life
had
come
for
him
and
for
her
his
heart
beat
fiercely
and
his
great
shoulders
shook
with
the
agony
that
was
eating
at
his
soul
yes
it
is
the
pretty
music
my
mélisse
he
murmured
softly
choking
back
his
sobs
it
is
the
pretty
music
in
the
skies
the
hand
pressed
more
tightly
against
his
face
it
not
the
music
in
the
skies
john
it
is
real
real
music
that
i
hear
it
the
sky
music
my
sweet
mélisse
shall
i
open
the
door
so
that
we
can
hear
it
better
the
hand
slipped
from
his
cheek
cummins
lifted
his
head
slowly
straightening
his
great
shoulders
as
he
looked
down
upon
the
white
face
from
which
even
the
flush
of
fever
was
disappearing
as
he
had
seen
the
pale
glow
of
the
northern
sun
fade
before
a
thickening
snow
he
stretched
his
long
gaunt
arms
straight
up
to
the
low
roof
of
the
cabin
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
prayed
prayed
to
the
god
who
had
made
for
him
this
world
of
snow
and
ice
and
endless
forest
very
near
to
the
dome
of
the
earth
who
had
given
him
this
woman
and
who
was
now
taking
her
from
him
when
he
looked
again
at
the
woman
her
eyes
were
open
and
there
glowed
in
them
still
the
feeble
fire
of
a
great
love
her
lips
too
pleaded
with
him
in
their
old
sweet
way
which
always
meant
that
he
was
to
kiss
them
and
stroke
her
hair
and
tell
her
again
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
whole
world
my
mélisse
he
crushed
his
face
to
her
his
sobbing
breath
smothering
itself
in
the
soft
masses
of
her
hair
while
her
arms
rose
weakly
and
fell
around
his
neck
he
heard
the
quick
gasping
struggle
for
breath
within
her
bosom
and
faintly
again
the
words
it
is
the
music
of
my
people
it
is
the
music
of
the
angels
in
the
skies
my
sweet
mélisse
it
is
our
music
i
will
open
the
door
the
arms
had
slipped
from
his
shoulders
gently
he
ran
his
rough
fingers
through
the
loose
glory
of
the
woman
hair
and
stroked
her
face
as
softly
as
he
might
have
caressed
the
cheek
of
a
sleeping
child
i
will
open
the
door
mélisse
his
moccasined
feet
made
no
sound
as
he
moved
across
the
little
room
which
was
their
home
at
the
door
he
paused
and
listened
then
he
opened
it
and
the
floods
of
the
white
night
poured
in
upon
him
as
he
stood
with
his
eyes
turned
to
where
the
cold
pale
flashes
of
the
aurora
were
playing
over
the
pole
there
came
to
him
the
hissing
saddening
song
of
the
northern
lights
a
song
of
vast
unending
loneliness
which
they
two
had
come
to
know
as
the
music
of
the
skies
beyond
that
there
was
no
sound
to
the
eyes
of
john
cummins
there
was
no
visible
movement
of
life
and
yet
he
saw
signs
of
it
signs
which
drew
his
breath
from
him
in
choking
gulps
and
which
sent
him
out
into
the
night
so
that
the
woman
might
not
hear
it
was
an
hour
past
midnight
at
the
post
which
had
the
barren
lands
at
its
back
door
it
was
the
hour
of
deep
slumber
for
its
people
but
there
was
no
sleep
for
any
of
them
lights
burned
dimly
in
the
few
rough
log
homes
the
company
store
was
aglow
and
the
office
a
haven
for
the
men
of
the
wilderness
shot
one
gleaming
yellow
eye
out
into
the
white
gloom
the
post
was
awake
it
was
waiting
it
was
listening
it
was
watching
as
the
woman
door
opened
wide
and
brimful
of
light
a
door
of
one
of
the
log
houses
opened
and
then
another
and
out
into
the
night
like
dim
shadows
trod
the
moccasined
men
from
the
factor
office
and
stood
there
waiting
for
the
word
of
life
or
death
from
john
cummins
in
their
own
fashion
these
men
who
without
knowing
it
lived
very
near
to
the
ways
of
god
sent
mute
prayers
into
the
starry
heavens
that
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
might
yet
be
spared
to
them
it
was
just
two
summers
before
that
this
beautiful
thing
had
come
into
cummins
life
and
into
the
life
of
the
post
cummins
lithe
as
a
cat
as
the
eternal
mountain
of
the
crees
and
the
best
of
the
company
hunters
had
brought
mélisse
thither
as
his
bride
seventeen
rough
hearts
had
welcomed
her
they
had
assembled
about
that
little
cabin
in
which
the
light
was
shining
now
speechless
in
their
adoration
of
this
woman
who
had
come
among
them
their
caps
in
their
hands
their
faces
shining
their
eyes
shifting
before
the
glorious
ones
that
looked
at
them
and
smiled
at
them
as
the
woman
shook
their
hands
one
by
one
perhaps
she
was
not
strictly
beautiful
as
most
people
judge
but
she
was
beautiful
here
four
hundred
miles
beyond
civilization
mukee
the
had
never
seen
a
white
woman
for
even
the
factor
wife
was
part
chippewayan
and
no
one
of
the
others
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
southern
wilderness
more
than
once
each
twelvemonth
or
so
melisse
hair
was
brown
and
soft
and
it
shone
with
a
sunny
glory
that
reached
far
back
into
their
conception
of
things
dreamed
of
but
never
seen
her
eyes
were
as
blue
as
the
early
wild
flowers
that
came
after
the
spring
floods
and
her
voice
was
the
sweetest
sound
that
had
ever
fallen
upon
their
ears
so
these
men
thought
when
cummins
first
brought
home
his
wife
and
the
masterpiece
which
each
had
painted
in
his
soul
and
brain
was
never
changed
each
week
and
month
added
to
the
value
of
that
picture
as
the
passing
of
a
century
might
add
to
a
raphael
or
a
vandyke
the
woman
became
more
human
and
less
an
angel
of
course
but
that
only
made
her
more
real
and
allowed
them
to
become
acquainted
with
her
to
talk
with
her
and
to
love
her
more
there
was
no
thought
of
wrong
for
the
devotion
of
these
men
was
a
great
passionless
love
unhinting
of
sin
cummins
and
his
wife
accepted
it
and
added
to
it
when
they
could
and
were
the
happiest
pair
in
all
that
vast
northland
the
girl
she
was
scarce
more
than
budding
into
womanhood
fell
happily
into
the
ways
of
her
new
life
she
did
nothing
that
was
elementally
unusual
nothing
more
than
any
pure
woman
reared
in
the
love
of
god
and
of
a
home
would
have
done
in
her
spare
hours
she
began
to
teach
the
wild
little
children
about
the
post
and
every
sunday
she
told
them
wonderful
stories
out
of
the
bible
she
ministered
to
the
sick
for
that
was
a
part
of
her
code
of
life
everywhere
she
carried
her
glad
smile
her
cheery
greeting
her
wistful
earnestness
to
brighten
what
seemed
to
her
the
sad
and
lonely
lives
of
these
silent
men
of
the
north
and
she
succeeded
not
because
she
was
unlike
other
millions
of
her
kind
but
because
of
the
difference
between
the
fortieth
degree
and
the
sixtieth
the
difference
in
the
viewpoint
of
men
who
fought
themselves
into
moral
shreds
in
the
big
game
of
life
and
those
who
lived
a
thousand
miles
nearer
to
the
dome
of
the
earth
a
few
days
before
there
had
come
a
wonderful
event
in
the
history
of
the
company
post
a
new
life
was
born
into
the
little
cabin
of
cummins
and
his
wife
after
this
the
silent
wordless
worship
of
their
people
was
filled
with
something
very
near
to
pathos
cummins
wife
was
a
mother
she
was
one
of
them
now
an
indissoluble
part
of
their
existence
a
part
of
it
as
truly
as
the
strange
lights
for
ever
hovering
over
the
pole
as
surely
as
the
countless
stars
that
never
left
the
night
skies
as
surely
as
the
endless
forests
and
the
deep
snows
then
had
come
the
sudden
change
and
the
gloom
that
brought
with
it
the
shadow
of
death
fell
like
a
pall
upon
the
post
stifling
its
life
and
bringing
with
it
a
grief
that
those
who
lived
there
had
never
known
before
there
came
to
them
no
word
from
cummins
now
he
stood
for
a
moment
before
his
lighted
door
and
then
went
back
and
the
word
passed
softly
from
one
to
another
that
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
was
still
living
her
sweet
life
in
that
little
cabin
at
the
end
of
the
clearing
you
hear
the
music
in
the
skies
now
my
mélisse
whispered
the
man
kneeling
beside
her
again
it
is
very
pretty
it
was
not
that
repeated
the
woman
she
attempted
to
stroke
his
face
but
cummins
saw
nothing
of
the
effort
for
the
hand
lay
all
but
motionless
he
saw
nothing
of
the
fading
softness
that
glowed
in
the
big
loving
eyes
for
his
own
eyes
were
blinded
by
a
hot
film
and
the
woman
saw
nothing
of
the
hot
film
so
torture
was
saved
them
both
but
suddenly
the
woman
quivered
and
cummins
heard
a
thrilling
sound
it
is
the
music
she
panted
john
john
it
is
the
music
of
my
people
the
man
straightened
himself
his
face
turned
to
the
open
door
he
heard
it
now
was
it
the
blessed
angels
coming
for
his
mélisse
he
rose
a
sobbing
note
in
his
throat
and
went
his
arms
stretched
out
to
meet
them
he
had
never
heard
a
sound
like
that
never
in
all
his
life
in
this
endless
wilderness
he
went
from
the
door
out
into
the
night
and
step
by
step
through
the
snow
toward
the
black
edge
of
the
spruce
forest
the
sobs
fell
chokingly
from
his
lips
and
his
arms
were
still
reaching
out
to
greet
this
messenger
of
the
god
of
his
beloved
for
cummins
was
a
man
of
the
wild
and
mannerless
ways
of
a
savage
world
and
he
knew
not
what
to
make
of
this
sweetness
that
came
to
them
from
out
of
the
depths
of
the
black
forest
my
mélisse
my
mélisse
he
sobbed
a
figure
came
from
the
shadows
and
with
the
figure
came
the
music
sweet
and
soft
and
low
john
cummins
stopped
and
turned
his
face
straight
up
to
the
sky
his
heart
died
within
him
the
music
ceased
and
when
he
looked
again
the
figure
was
close
to
him
staggering
as
it
walked
and
a
face
white
and
thin
and
starved
came
with
it
it
was
a
boy
face
for
the
museek
of
the
violon
to
eat
he
heard
and
the
thin
figure
swayed
and
fell
almost
into
his
arms
the
voice
came
weak
again
thees
is
jan
jan
thoreau
and
his
violon
the
woman
bloodless
face
and
her
great
staring
dark
eyes
greeted
them
as
they
entered
the
cabin
as
the
man
knelt
beside
her
again
and
lifted
her
head
against
his
breast
she
whispered
once
more
it
is
the
music
of
my
people
the
violin
john
cummins
turned
his
head
play
he
breathed
ah
the
white
angel
is
seek
ver
seek
murmured
jan
and
he
drew
his
bow
gently
across
the
strings
of
his
violin
from
the
instrument
there
came
something
so
soft
and
sweet
that
john
cummins
closed
his
eyes
as
he
held
the
woman
against
his
breast
and
listened
not
until
he
opened
them
again
and
felt
a
strange
chill
against
his
cheek
did
he
know
that
his
beloved
soul
had
gone
from
him
on
the
gentle
music
of
jan
thoreau
violin
chapter
ii
mukee
story
for
many
minutes
after
the
last
gentle
breath
had
passed
from
the
woman
lips
jan
thoreau
played
softly
upon
his
violin
it
was
the
great
sob
of
john
cummins
that
stopped
him
as
tenderly
as
if
she
had
fallen
into
a
sweet
sleep
from
which
he
feared
to
awaken
her
the
man
unclasped
his
arms
and
lowered
his
wife
head
to
the
pillow
and
with
staring
black
eyes
jan
crushed
his
violin
against
his
ragged
breast
and
watched
him
as
he
smoothed
back
the
shimmering
hair
and
looked
long
and
hungrily
into
the
still
white
face
cummins
turned
to
him
and
in
the
dim
light
of
the
cabin
their
eyes
met
it
was
then
that
jan
thoreau
knew
what
had
happened
he
forgot
his
starvation
he
crushed
his
violin
closer
and
whispered
to
himself
the
white
angel
ees
gone
cummins
rose
from
the
bedside
slowly
like
a
man
who
had
suddenly
grown
old
his
moccasined
feet
dragged
as
he
went
to
the
door
they
stumbled
when
he
went
out
into
the
pale
of
the
night
jan
followed
swaying
weakly
for
the
last
of
his
strength
had
gone
in
the
playing
of
the
violin
midway
in
the
cabin
he
paused
and
his
eyes
glowed
with
a
wild
strange
grief
as
he
gazed
down
upon
the
still
face
of
cummins
wife
beautiful
in
death
as
it
had
been
in
life
and
with
the
sweet
softness
of
life
still
lingering
there
some
time
ages
and
ages
ago
he
had
known
such
a
face
and
had
felt
the
great
clutching
love
of
it
something
drew
him
to
where
john
cummins
had
knelt
and
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
gazed
hungrily
and
longingly
where
john
cummins
had
gazed
his
pulse
was
beating
feebly
the
weakness
of
seven
starvation
blurred
his
eyes
and
unconsciously
he
sank
over
the
bed
and
one
of
his
thin
hands
touched
the
soft
sweep
of
the
woman
hair
a
stifled
cry
fell
from
him
as
he
jerked
himself
rigidly
erect
and
as
if
for
the
desecration
of
that
touch
there
was
but
one
way
of
forgiveness
he
drew
his
violin
half
to
his
shoulder
and
for
a
few
moments
played
so
softly
that
none
but
the
spirit
of
the
woman
and
himself
could
hear
cummins
had
partly
closed
the
door
after
him
but
watchers
had
seen
the
opening
of
it
a
door
opened
here
and
another
there
and
paths
of
yellow
light
flashed
over
the
snow
as
shadowy
life
came
forth
to
greet
what
message
he
brought
from
the
little
cabin
beyond
those
flashes
of
light
there
was
no
other
movement
and
no
sound
dark
figures
stood
motionless
the
lonely
howl
of
a
ended
in
a
wail
of
pain
as
some
one
kicked
it
into
terrified
silence
the
hollow
cough
of
mukee
father
was
smothered
in
the
thick
fur
of
his
cap
as
he
thrust
his
head
from
his
little
shack
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
a
score
of
eyes
watched
cummins
as
he
came
out
into
the
snow
and
the
rough
loyal
hearts
of
those
who
looked
throbbed
in
fearful
anticipation
of
the
word
he
might
be
bringing
to
them
sometimes
a
nation
ceases
to
breathe
in
the
last
moments
of
its
dying
chief
and
the
black
wings
of
calamity
gather
over
its
people
enshrouding
them
in
a
strange
gloom
and
a
stranger
fear
and
so
because
the
greatest
of
all
tragedies
had
come
into
their
little
world
cummins
people
were
speechless
in
their
grief
and
their
waiting
for
the
final
word
and
when
the
word
came
to
them
at
last
and
passed
from
lip
to
lip
and
from
one
grim
tense
face
to
another
the
doors
closed
again
and
the
lights
went
out
one
by
one
until
there
remained
only
the
yellow
eye
of
the
factor
office
and
the
faint
glow
from
the
little
cabin
in
which
john
cummins
knelt
with
his
sobbing
face
crushed
close
to
that
of
his
dead
there
was
no
one
who
noticed
jan
thoreau
when
he
came
through
the
door
of
the
factor
office
his
coat
of
was
in
tatters
his
feet
thrust
themselves
from
the
toes
of
his
moccasins
his
face
was
so
thin
and
white
that
it
shone
with
the
pallor
of
death
from
its
frame
of
straight
dark
hair
his
eyes
gleamed
like
black
diamonds
the
madness
of
hunger
was
in
him
an
hour
before
death
had
been
gripping
at
his
throat
when
he
stumbled
upon
the
lights
of
the
post
that
night
he
would
have
died
in
the
deep
snows
wrapped
in
its
thick
coat
of
bearskin
he
clutched
his
violin
to
his
breast
and
sank
down
in
a
ragged
heap
beside
the
hot
stove
his
eyes
traveled
about
him
in
fierce
demand
there
is
no
beggary
among
these
men
of
the
far
north
and
jan
lips
did
not
beg
he
unwrapped
the
bearskin
and
whispered
for
the
museek
of
the
violon
to
eat
he
played
even
as
the
words
fell
from
him
but
only
for
a
moment
for
the
bow
slipped
from
his
nerveless
grip
and
his
head
sank
forward
upon
his
breast
in
the
eyes
there
was
something
of
the
wild
beauty
that
gleamed
in
jan
for
an
instant
those
eyes
had
met
in
the
savage
recognition
of
blood
and
when
jan
head
fell
weakly
and
his
violin
slipped
to
the
floor
mukee
lifted
him
in
his
strong
arms
and
carried
him
to
the
shack
in
the
edge
of
the
spruce
and
balsam
and
there
was
no
one
who
noticed
jan
the
next
day
except
mukee
he
was
fed
his
frozen
blood
grew
warm
as
life
returned
he
felt
more
and
more
the
pall
of
gloom
that
had
settled
over
this
spark
of
life
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
he
had
seen
the
woman
in
life
and
in
death
and
he
too
loved
her
and
grieved
that
she
was
no
more
he
said
nothing
he
asked
nothing
but
he
saw
the
spirit
of
adoration
in
the
sad
tense
faces
of
the
men
he
saw
it
in
the
eyes
of
the
wild
little
children
who
had
grown
to
worship
cummins
wife
he
read
it
in
the
slinking
stillness
of
the
dogs
in
the
terrible
pulseless
quiet
that
had
settled
about
him
it
was
not
hard
for
jan
to
understand
for
he
too
worshiped
the
memory
of
a
white
sweet
face
like
the
one
that
he
had
seen
in
the
cabin
he
knew
that
this
worship
at
lac
bain
was
a
pure
worship
for
the
honor
of
the
big
snows
was
a
part
of
his
soul
it
was
his
religion
and
the
religion
of
these
others
who
lived
four
hundred
miles
or
more
from
a
southern
settlement
it
meant
what
civilization
could
not
understand
freezing
and
slow
starvation
rather
than
theft
and
respect
for
the
tenth
commandment
above
all
other
things
it
meant
that
up
here
under
the
cold
chill
of
the
northern
skies
things
were
as
god
meant
them
to
be
and
that
a
few
of
his
creatures
could
live
in
a
love
that
was
neither
possession
nor
sin
a
year
after
cummins
brought
his
wife
into
the
north
a
man
came
to
the
post
from
fort
churchill
on
hudson
bay
he
was
an
englishman
belonging
to
the
home
office
of
the
hudson
bay
company
in
london
he
brought
with
him
something
new
as
the
woman
had
brought
something
new
only
in
this
instance
it
was
an
element
of
life
which
cummins
people
could
not
understand
it
breathed
of
tragedy
from
the
first
to
the
men
of
the
post
to
the
englishman
on
the
other
hand
it
promised
to
be
but
an
incident
a
passing
adventure
in
pleasure
here
again
was
that
difference
of
viewpoint
the
eternity
of
difference
between
the
middle
and
the
end
of
the
earth
cummins
was
away
for
a
month
on
a
that
went
into
the
barren
lands
at
these
times
the
woman
fell
as
a
heritage
to
those
who
remained
and
they
watched
over
her
as
a
parent
might
guard
its
child
yet
the
keenest
eyes
would
not
have
perceived
that
this
was
so
with
cummins
gone
the
tragedy
progressed
swiftly
toward
finality
the
englishman
came
from
among
women
for
months
he
had
been
in
a
torment
of
desolation
cummins
wife
was
to
him
like
a
flower
suddenly
come
to
relieve
the
tantalizing
barrenness
of
a
desert
and
with
the
wiles
and
ways
of
civilization
he
sought
to
breathe
its
fragrance
in
the
days
and
weeks
that
followed
he
talked
a
great
deal
when
heated
by
the
warmth
of
the
box
stove
and
by
his
own
thoughts
and
this
was
because
he
had
not
yet
measured
the
hearts
of
cummins
people
and
because
the
woman
knew
nothing
of
what
was
said
about
the
box
stove
she
continued
in
the
even
course
of
her
pure
life
neither
resisting
nor
encouraging
the
yet
ever
tempting
him
with
that
sweetness
which
she
gave
to
all
alike
as
yet
there
was
no
suspicion
in
her
soul
she
accepted
the
englishman
friendship
for
he
was
a
stranger
among
her
people
she
did
not
hear
the
false
note
she
saw
no
step
that
promised
evil
only
the
men
at
the
post
heard
and
saw
and
understood
like
so
many
faithful
beasts
they
were
ready
to
spring
to
rend
flesh
to
tear
life
out
of
him
who
threatened
the
desecration
of
all
that
was
good
and
pure
and
beautiful
to
them
and
yet
dumb
in
their
devotion
and
faith
they
waited
and
watched
for
a
sign
from
the
woman
the
blue
eyes
of
cummins
wife
the
words
of
her
gentle
lips
the
touch
of
her
hands
had
made
law
at
the
post
if
she
smiled
upon
the
stranger
and
talked
with
him
and
was
pleased
with
him
that
was
only
one
other
law
that
she
had
made
for
them
to
respect
so
they
were
quiet
evaded
the
englishman
as
much
as
possible
and
watched
always
watched
one
day
something
happened
cummins
wife
came
into
the
store
and
a
quick
flush
shot
into
her
cheeks
and
the
glitter
of
blue
diamonds
into
her
eyes
when
she
saw
the
stranger
standing
there
the
man
red
face
grew
redder
and
he
shifted
his
gaze
when
cummins
wife
passed
him
she
drew
her
skirt
close
to
her
and
there
was
the
poise
of
a
queen
in
her
head
the
glory
of
wife
and
womanhood
the
living
breathing
essence
of
all
that
was
beautiful
in
her
people
honor
of
the
big
snows
that
night
mukee
the
slunk
around
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
to
see
that
all
was
well
in
cummins
little
home
once
mukee
had
suffered
a
that
went
clear
to
the
bone
and
the
woman
had
saved
his
hand
after
that
the
savage
in
him
was
enslaved
to
her
like
an
invisible
spirit
he
crouched
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
snow
looking
at
the
pale
filter
of
light
that
came
through
a
hole
in
the
curtain
of
the
woman
window
and
as
he
looked
something
came
between
him
and
the
light
against
the
cabin
he
saw
the
shadow
of
a
sneaking
human
form
and
as
silently
as
the
steely
flash
of
the
aurora
over
his
head
as
swiftly
as
a
lean
deer
he
sped
through
the
gloom
of
the
forest
edge
and
came
up
behind
the
woman
home
with
the
caution
of
a
lynx
his
head
close
to
the
snow
he
peered
around
the
logs
it
was
the
englishman
who
stood
looking
through
the
tear
in
that
curtained
window
mukee
moccasined
feet
made
no
sound
his
hand
fell
as
gently
as
a
child
upon
the
stranger
arm
thees
is
not
the
honor
of
the
beeg
snows
he
whispered
come
a
sickly
pallor
filled
the
other
man
face
but
mukee
voice
was
soft
and
dispassionate
his
touch
was
velvety
in
its
hint
and
he
went
with
the
guiding
hand
away
from
the
curtained
window
smiling
in
a
companionable
way
mukee
teeth
gleamed
back
the
englishman
chuckled
then
mukee
hands
changed
they
flew
to
the
thick
reddening
throat
of
the
man
from
civilization
and
without
a
sound
the
two
sank
together
upon
the
snow
the
next
day
a
messenger
behind
six
dogs
set
out
for
fort
churchill
with
word
for
the
company
home
office
that
the
englishman
had
died
in
the
big
snow
which
was
true
mukee
told
this
to
jan
for
there
was
the
bond
of
blood
between
them
it
was
a
painting
of
life
and
love
and
purity
deep
down
in
the
loneliness
of
his
heart
jan
thoreau
in
his
own
simple
way
thanked
the
great
god
that
it
had
been
given
to
him
to
play
his
violin
as
the
woman
died
chapter
iii
little
melisse
the
passing
of
cummins
wife
was
as
quiet
as
had
been
her
coming
with
bare
heads
their
shaggy
hair
falling
wildly
about
their
faces
their
lips
set
tight
to
choke
back
their
grief
the
few
at
the
post
went
one
by
one
into
the
little
cabin
and
gazed
for
the
last
time
upon
her
face
there
was
but
one
sound
other
than
the
gentle
tread
of
their
moccasined
feet
and
that
was
a
catching
sobbing
moan
that
fell
from
the
thick
gray
beard
of
williams
the
old
factor
after
that
they
carried
her
to
where
a
clearing
had
been
cut
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
at
the
foot
of
a
giant
spruce
towering
to
the
sky
they
lowered
her
into
the
frozen
earth
gaspingly
williams
stumbled
over
the
words
on
a
ragged
page
that
had
been
torn
from
a
bible
the
rough
men
who
stood
about
him
bowed
their
wild
heads
upon
their
breasts
and
sobs
broke
from
them
at
last
williams
stopped
his
reading
stretched
his
long
arms
above
his
head
and
cried
chokingly
the
great
god
keep
mees
cummins
as
the
earth
fell
there
came
from
the
edge
of
the
forest
the
low
sweet
music
of
jan
thoreau
violin
no
man
in
all
the
world
could
have
told
what
he
played
for
it
was
the
music
of
jan
soul
wild
and
whispering
of
the
winds
sweetened
by
some
strange
inheritance
that
had
come
to
him
with
the
picture
which
he
carried
in
his
throbbing
heart
he
played
until
only
the
tall
spruce
and
john
cummins
stood
over
the
lone
grave
when
he
stopped
the
man
turned
to
him
and
they
went
together
to
the
little
cabin
where
the
woman
had
lived
there
was
something
new
in
the
cabin
now
a
tiny
white
breathing
thing
over
which
an
indian
woman
watched
the
boy
stood
beside
john
cummins
looking
down
upon
it
and
trembling
ah
he
whispered
his
great
eyes
glowing
it
ees
the
leetle
white
angel
it
is
the
little
mélisse
replied
the
man
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
with
his
sad
face
close
to
the
new
life
that
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
one
that
had
just
gone
out
jan
felt
something
tugging
in
a
strange
way
at
his
heart
and
he
too
fell
upon
his
knees
beside
john
cummins
in
this
first
worship
of
the
child
from
this
hour
of
their
first
kneeling
before
the
little
life
in
the
cabin
something
sprang
up
between
jan
thoreau
and
john
cummins
which
it
would
have
been
hard
for
man
to
break
looking
up
after
many
moments
contemplation
of
the
little
mélisse
jan
gazed
straight
into
cummins
face
and
whispered
softly
the
word
which
in
cree
means
father
this
was
jan
first
word
for
mélisse
when
he
looked
back
the
baby
was
wriggling
and
kicking
as
he
had
seen
tiny
wriggle
and
kick
before
their
eyes
were
open
his
beautiful
eyes
laughed
as
cautiously
as
if
he
were
playing
with
hot
iron
he
reached
out
a
thin
hand
and
when
one
of
his
fingers
suddenly
fell
upon
something
very
soft
and
warm
he
jerked
it
back
as
quickly
as
if
he
had
been
burned
that
night
when
jan
picked
up
his
violin
to
go
back
to
mukee
cabin
cummins
put
his
two
big
hands
on
the
boy
shoulders
and
said
jan
who
are
you
and
where
did
you
come
from
jan
stretched
his
arm
vaguely
to
the
north
jan
thoreau
he
replied
simply
thees
is
my
violon
we
come
alone
through
the
beeg
snow
cummins
stared
as
if
he
saw
a
wonderful
picture
in
the
boy
eyes
he
dropped
his
hands
and
walked
to
the
door
when
they
stood
alone
outside
he
pointed
up
to
the
stars
and
to
the
veil
of
silver
light
that
the
awakening
aurora
was
spreading
over
the
northern
skies
get
your
bearings
and
tell
me
again
where
you
came
from
jan
unhesitatingly
the
boy
pointed
into
the
north

my
violon
keep
the
wolf
off
at
night
look
again
jan
did
you
come
from
there
or
there
or
there
cummins
turned
slowly
facing
first
to
the
east
and
hudson
bay
then
to
the
south
and
lastly
to
the
west
there
was
something
more
than
curiosity
in
the
tense
face
that
came
back
in
staring
inquiry
to
jan
thoreau
the
boy
hunched
his
shoulders
and
his
eyes
flashed
it
ees
not
lie
that
jan
thoreau
and
hees
violon
come
through
the
beeg
snow
he
replied
softly
it
ees
not
lie
there
was
more
than
gentleness
in
john
cummins
touch
now
jan
could
not
understand
it
but
he
yielded
to
it
and
went
back
into
the
cabin
there
was
more
than
friendship
in
cummins
eyes
when
he
placed
his
hands
again
upon
the
boy
shoulders
and
jan
could
not
understand
that
there
is
plenty
of
room
here
now
said
cummins
huskily
will
you
stay
with
the
little
mélisse
and
me
with
the
leetle
mélisse
gasped
the
boy
softly
he
sped
to
the
tiny
cot
and
knelt
beside
it
his
thin
shoulders
hunched
over
his
long
black
hair
shining
lustrously
in
the
his
breath
coming
in
quick
sobbing
happiness
i
i
stay
with
the
leetle
white
angel
for
ever
and
ever
he
whispered
his
words
meant
only
for
the
unhearing
ears
of
the
child
jan
thoreau
will
stay
yes
and
hees
violon
i
give
it
to
you
and
ze
museek
he
laid
his
precious
violin
across
the
foot
of
the
cot
chapter
iv
the
problem
in
the
days
that
followed
there
came
other
things
which
jan
could
not
understand
and
which
he
made
no
great
effort
to
understand
he
talked
little
even
to
cummins
he
listened
and
his
eyes
would
answer
or
he
would
reply
with
strange
eery
little
hunches
of
his
shoulders
which
ruffled
up
his
hair
to
the
few
simple
souls
at
the
post
he
brought
with
him
more
than
his
starved
body
from
out
of
the
unknown
wilderness
this
was
the
chief
cause
of
those
things
which
he
could
not
understand
no
man
learned
more
of
him
than
had
cummins
even
to
mukee
his
history
was
equally
simple
and
short
always
he
said
that
he
came
from
out
of
the
north
which
meant
the
barren
lands
and
the
barren
lands
meant
death
no
man
had
ever
come
across
them
as
jan
had
come
and
at
another
time
and
under
other
circumstances
cummins
and
his
people
would
have
believed
him
mad
but
others
had
listened
to
that
strange
sweet
music
that
came
to
them
from
out
of
the
forest
on
the
night
when
the
woman
died
and
they
like
cummins
had
been
stirred
by
thrilling
thoughts
they
knew
little
of
god
as
god
is
preached
but
they
knew
a
great
deal
about
him
in
other
ways
they
knew
that
jan
thoreau
had
come
like
a
messenger
from
the
angels
that
the
woman
soul
had
gone
out
to
meet
him
and
that
she
had
died
sweetly
on
john
cummins
breast
while
he
played
so
the
boy
with
his
thin
sensitive
face
and
his
great
beautiful
eyes
became
a
part
of
what
the
woman
had
left
behind
for
them
to
love
as
a
part
of
her
they
accepted
him
without
further
questioning
as
to
who
he
was
or
whence
he
came
in
a
way
he
made
up
for
her
loss
the
woman
had
brought
something
new
and
sweet
into
their
barren
lives
and
he
brought
something
new
and
sweet
the
music
of
his
violin
he
played
for
them
in
the
evening
in
the
factor
office
and
at
these
times
they
knew
that
cummins
wife
was
very
near
to
them
and
that
she
was
speaking
to
them
through
the
things
which
jan
thoreau
played
music
had
long
passed
out
of
their
lives
into
some
indeed
it
had
never
come
years
ago
williams
had
been
at
a
post
where
there
was
an
accordion
cummins
had
heard
music
when
he
went
down
to
civilization
for
his
wife
more
than
two
years
ago
to
the
others
it
was
mystery
which
stirred
them
to
the
depths
of
their
souls
and
which
revealed
to
them
many
things
that
had
long
been
hidden
in
the
dust
of
the
past
these
were
hours
of
triumph
for
jan
in
the
factor
office
perched
on
a
box
with
his
back
to
the
wall
his
head
thrown
back
his
black
eyes
shining
his
long
hair
giving
to
his
face
a
half
savage
beauty
he
was
more
than
king
to
the
men
about
him
they
listened
movelessly
soundlessly
and
when
he
stopped
there
was
still
neither
move
nor
sound
until
he
had
wrapped
his
violin
in
its
and
had
returned
to
john
cummins
and
the
little
mélisse
jan
understood
the
silence
and
took
it
for
what
it
meant
but
it
was
the
audience
in
the
little
cabin
that
jan
liked
best
and
most
of
all
he
loved
to
have
the
little
mélisse
alone
as
the
days
of
early
spring
trapping
approached
and
the
wilderness
for
a
hundred
miles
around
the
post
was
crisscrossed
with
the
trails
of
the
cree
and
chippewayan
cummins
was
absent
for
days
at
a
time
strengthening
the
company
friendships
and
bargaining
for
the
catch
that
would
be
coming
to
market
about
eight
weeks
later
this
was
a
year
of
intense
rivalry
for
the
révillons
french
competitors
of
the
company
had
established
a
post
two
hundred
miles
to
the
west
and
rumor
spread
that
they
were
to
give
sixty
pounds
of
flour
to
the
company
forty
and
four
feet
of
cloth
to
the
yard
this
meant
action
among
williams
and
his
people
and
the
factor
himself
plunged
into
the
wilderness
mukee
the
went
among
his
scattered
tribesmen
along
the
edge
of
the
barrens
stirring
them
by
the
eloquence
of
new
promises
and
by
fierce
condemnation
of
the
interlopers
to
the
west
old
with
a
strain
of
eskimo
in
him
went
boldly
behind
his
dogs
to
meet
the
little
black
people
from
farther
north
who
came
down
after
foxes
and
polar
bears
that
had
been
carried
beyond
their
own
world
on
the
of
the
preceding
spring
young
williams
the
factor
son
followed
after
cummins
and
the
rest
of
the
company
men
went
into
the
south
and
east
the
exodus
left
desolate
lifelessness
at
the
post
the
windows
of
the
fireless
cabins
were
thick
with
clinging
frost
there
was
no
movement
in
the
factor
office
the
dogs
were
gone
and
wolves
and
lynx
sniffed
closer
each
night
in
the
oppression
of
this
desertion
the
few
indian
and
children
kept
indoors
and
williams
chippewayan
wife
fat
and
lazy
left
the
company
store
securely
locked
in
this
silence
and
lifelessness
jan
thoreau
felt
a
new
and
happiness
to
him
the
sound
of
life
was
a
thing
vibrant
with
harshness
quiet
the
dead
pulseless
quiet
of
lifelessness
was
beautiful
he
dreamed
in
it
and
it
was
then
that
his
fingers
discovered
new
things
in
his
violin
he
often
sent
maballa
the
indian
woman
who
cared
for
mélisse
to
gossip
with
williams
wife
so
that
he
was
alone
a
great
deal
with
the
baby
at
these
times
when
the
door
was
safely
barred
against
the
outside
world
it
was
a
different
jan
thoreau
who
crouched
upon
his
knees
beside
the
cot
his
face
was
aflame
with
a
great
absorbing
passion
which
at
other
times
he
concealed
his
beautiful
eyes
glowed
with
hidden
fires
and
he
whispered
soothing
singsong
things
to
the
child
and
played
softly
upon
his
violin
leaning
his
black
head
far
down
so
that
the
baby
mélisse
could
clutch
her
appreciative
fingers
in
his
hair
ah
ze
sweet
leetle
white
angel
he
would
cry
as
she
tugged
and
kicked
i
luf
you
so
i
luf
you
an
will
stay
always
ah
play
ze
violon
ah
mon
dieu
you
will
be
ze
white
angel
lak
her
he
would
laugh
and
coo
like
a
mother
and
talk
for
at
these
times
jan
thoreau
tongue
was
as
voluble
as
his
violin
sometimes
mélisse
listened
as
if
she
understood
the
wonderful
things
he
was
telling
her
she
would
lie
upon
her
back
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
her
little
red
fists
doubled
over
his
bow
or
a
thumb
thrust
into
her
mouth
and
the
longer
she
lay
like
this
gazing
at
him
blankly
the
more
convinced
jan
became
that
she
was
understanding
him
and
his
voice
grew
soft
and
low
and
his
eyes
shone
with
a
soft
mist
as
he
told
her
those
things
which
john
cummins
would
have
given
much
to
know
some
day
you
shall
understand
why
it
happened
sweet
mélisse
he
whispered
bringing
his
eyes
so
near
that
she
reached
up
an
inquiring
finger
to
them
then
you
will
luf
jan
thoreau
there
were
other
times
when
jan
did
not
talk
but
when
the
baby
mélisse
talked
to
him
and
these
were
moments
of
even
greater
joy
with
the
baby
wriggling
and
kicking
and
making
queer
noises
in
her
tiny
cot
he
would
sit
silently
upon
his
heels
watching
her
with
the
pride
and
happiness
of
a
mother
lynx
in
the
first
tumbling
frolics
of
her
kittens
once
when
mélisse
straightened
herself
for
an
instant
and
half
reached
up
her
tiny
arms
to
him
laughing
and
cooing
into
his
face
he
gave
a
glad
cry
crushed
his
face
down
to
hers
and
did
what
he
had
not
dared
to
do
before
kissed
her
there
was
something
about
it
that
frightened
the
little
mélisse
and
she
set
up
a
wailing
that
sent
jan
in
a
panic
of
dismay
for
maballa
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
ventured
to
kiss
her
again
it
was
during
this
fortnight
of
desolation
at
the
post
that
jan
discovered
the
big
problem
for
himself
and
john
cummins
in
the
last
days
of
the
second
week
he
spent
much
of
his
time
skirting
the
edge
of
the
barrens
in
search
of
caribou
that
there
might
be
meat
in
plenty
when
the
dogs
and
men
returned
a
little
later
one
afternoon
he
returned
early
while
the
pale
sun
was
still
in
the
sky
laden
with
the
meat
of
a
as
he
came
from
the
edge
of
the
forest
his
slender
body
doubled
over
under
the
weight
of
his
pack
a
terrifying
sight
greeted
him
in
the
little
clearing
at
the
post
upon
her
knees
in
front
of
their
cabin
was
maballa
industriously
rolling
the
little
mélisse
about
in
a
soft
pile
of
snow
and
doing
her
work
as
she
firmly
believed
in
a
most
faithful
and
thorough
manner
with
a
shriek
jan
threw
off
his
pack
and
darted
toward
her
like
a
wild
thing
sacre
bleu
you
keel
keel
ze
leetle
mélisse
he
cried
shrilly
snatching
up
the
child
mon
dieu
she
ees
not
papoose
she
ees
ceevilize
ceevilize
and
he
ran
swiftly
with
her
into
the
cabin
flinging
back
a
torrent
of
cree
anathema
at
the
dumbly
bewildered
maballa
jan
left
the
rest
of
his
to
the
wolves
and
foxes
he
went
out
into
the
snow
and
found
half
a
dozen
other
in
which
the
helpless
mélisse
had
taken
her
chilling
baths
he
watched
maballa
with
a
new
growing
terror
and
fifty
times
a
day
he
said
to
her
mélisse
ees
not
papoose
she
ees
ceevilize
lak
her
and
he
would
point
to
the
lonely
grave
under
the
guardian
spruce
at
last
maballa
went
into
an
ecstasy
of
understanding
mélisse
was
not
to
be
taken
out
and
rolled
in
the
snow
so
she
brought
in
the
snow
and
rolled
it
over
mélisse
when
jan
discovered
this
his
tongue
twisted
itself
into
sounds
so
terrible
and
his
face
writhed
so
fiercely
that
maballa
began
to
comprehend
that
thereafter
no
snow
at
all
either
out
doors
or
in
was
to
be
used
in
the
physical
development
of
the
little
mélisse
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
problem
and
it
grew
and
burst
forth
in
all
its
significance
on
the
day
before
cummins
came
in
from
the
wilderness
for
a
week
maballa
had
been
dropping
sly
hints
of
a
wonderful
thing
which
she
and
the
factor
wife
were
making
for
the
baby
jan
had
visions
of
a
gorgeous
garment
covered
with
beads
and
gaudy
braid
which
would
give
the
little
mélisse
unending
delight
on
the
day
before
cummins
arrival
jan
came
in
from
chopping
wood
and
went
to
the
cot
it
was
empty
maballa
was
gone
a
sudden
fear
thrilled
him
to
the
marrow
and
he
sprang
back
to
the
cabin
door
ready
to
shriek
out
the
indian
woman
name
a
sound
stopped
him
the
softest
sweetest
sound
in
all
the
world
to
jan
thoreau
and
he
whirled
around
like
a
cat
mélisse
was
smiling
and
making
queer
friendly
little
signals
to
him
from
the
table
she
was
standing
upright
wedged
in
a
thing
from
which
only
her
tiny
white
face
peered
out
at
him
and
jan
knew
that
this
was
surprise
mélisse
was
in
a
mélisse
i
say
you
shall
be
no
papoose
he
cried
running
to
the
table
you
ees
ceevilize
you
shall
be
no
papoose
not
if
devil
come
tak
jan
thoreau
and
he
snatched
her
from
her
prison
flung
maballa
handiwork
out
into
the
snow
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
return
of
john
cummins
chapter
v
love
patches
cummins
returned
the
next
day
not
that
his
work
among
the
wild
trappers
to
the
south
was
finished
but
because
he
had
suffered
a
hurt
in
falling
from
a
slippery
ledge
when
jan
from
his
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
saw
the
team
race
up
to
the
little
cabin
and
a
strange
cree
half
carry
the
wounded
man
through
the
door
he
sped
swiftly
across
the
open
with
visions
of
new
misfortune
before
him
what
he
saw
when
he
reached
the
door
was
reassuring
cummins
was
upon
his
knees
beside
the
cot
his
big
shoulders
hunched
over
and
mélisse
was
welcoming
him
with
her
whole
vocabulary
of
sound
the
injury
to
cummins
leg
was
not
serious
and
not
being
serious
it
was
accepted
as
a
special
incident
of
providence
by
jan
for
the
new
thoughts
that
had
come
into
his
head
were
causing
him
great
uneasiness
he
lost
no
time
in
revealing
his
fears
after
maballa
had
been
sent
to
the
factor
wife
with
graphic
gesture
he
told
of
what
had
happened
cummins
hobbled
to
the
door
to
look
upon
the
wallows
in
the
snow
and
hobbled
back
to
the
table
when
jan
ran
there
in
excited
imitation
of
the
way
in
which
he
had
found
the
little
mélisse
in
maballa
sling
she
ees
ceevilize
finished
jan
hotly
she
ees
not
papoose
she
be
lak
her
his
great
eyes
shone
and
cummins
felt
a
thickening
in
his
throat
as
he
looked
into
them
and
saw
what
the
boy
meant
maballa
mak
papoose
out
of
mélisse
she
grow
know
lak
papoose
talk
lak
papoose
jan
feelings
overwhelmed
his
tongue
his
shining
hair
rumpled
thickly
about
his
face
as
he
leaned
anxiously
toward
cummins
and
cummins
in
turn
stared
down
in
dumb
perplexity
upon
the
joyful
kickings
and
wrigglings
of
the
growing
problem
ees
she
not
ceevilize
demanded
jan
ecstatically
bending
his
black
head
over
her
ah
ze
sweet
mélisse
yes
she
must
be
like
her
jan
just
as
good
and
just
as
sweet
and
just
as
beautiful
interrupted
cummins
gently
there
was
a
quick
intaking
of
his
breath
as
he
hobbled
back
to
his
own
cot
leaving
jan
at
play
with
the
baby
that
night
in
the
dim
sputtering
glow
of
an
john
cummins
and
jan
thoreau
solemnly
set
to
work
to
thrash
out
the
great
problem
that
had
suddenly
entered
into
their
existence
to
these
two
there
was
no
element
of
humor
in
what
they
were
doing
for
into
their
keeping
had
been
given
a
thing
for
which
god
had
not
schemed
them
the
woman
had
she
been
there
would
have
laughed
at
them
and
in
a
dozen
gentle
breaths
might
have
told
them
all
that
the
world
held
in
secret
between
mother
and
child
but
leaving
them
she
had
passed
on
to
them
something
that
was
life
like
herself
and
yet
mystery
had
fate
given
maballa
to
mélisse
for
a
mother
there
would
have
been
no
mystery
she
would
have
developed
as
naturally
as
a
or
a
a
savage
breath
of
life
in
a
savage
world
waxing
fat
in
in
a
moving
natural
thing
in
a
desolation
to
which
generations
and
centuries
of
forebears
had
given
it
birthright
but
mélisse
was
like
her
mother
in
the
dreams
of
the
two
who
were
planning
out
her
fate
she
was
to
be
a
reincarnation
of
her
mother
that
dream
left
a
ray
of
comfort
in
cummins
breast
when
his
wife
died
it
stirred
happy
visions
within
and
it
ended
with
a
serious
shock
when
maballa
brought
into
their
mental
perspective
of
things
the
possibilities
of
environment
so
far
as
cummins
knew
there
was
not
a
white
woman
nearer
than
fort
churchill
two
hundred
miles
away
in
all
that
region
he
knew
of
only
two
men
and
they
were
williams
and
himself
the
baby
mélisse
was
hopelessly
lost
in
a
world
of
savagery
honest
loyal
savagery
but
savagery
for
all
that
and
the
thought
of
it
brought
the
shadows
of
fear
and
foreboding
to
the
two
into
whose
lives
the
problem
had
just
come
long
into
the
night
they
talked
seriously
of
the
matter
while
mélisse
slept
and
the
longer
they
talked
the
greater
loomed
the
problem
before
them
cummins
fancied
that
he
already
began
to
see
signs
of
the
transformation
in
mélisse
she
was
passionately
fond
of
the
gaudy
things
maballa
gave
her
which
was
a
sign
of
savagery
she
was
charmed
by
confinement
in
the
which
was
another
sign
of
it
and
she
had
not
died
in
the
which
was
still
another
so
far
back
as
he
could
remember
cummins
had
never
come
into
of
a
white
baby
jan
was
as
blissfully
ignorant
so
they
determined
upon
immediate
and
strenuous
action
maballa
would
be
ceaselessly
watched
and
checked
at
every
turn
the
indian
children
would
not
be
allowed
to
come
near
mélisse
they
two
john
cummins
and
jan
thoreau
would
make
her
like
the
woman
who
slept
under
the
sentinel
spruce
she
ees
ceevilize
said
jan
with
finality
an
we
mus
keep
her
ceevilize
cummins
counted
back
gravely
upon
his
fingers
the
little
mélisse
was
four
months
and
eighteen
days
old
we
will
make
her
one
of
those
things
with
wheels
like
the
they
have
in
the
south
he
said
she
must
not
go
in
the
an
i
will
teach
her
ze
museek
whispered
jan
his
eyes
glowing
that
ees
ceevilize
suddenly
an
eager
light
came
into
cummins
face
and
he
pointed
to
a
box
standing
upon
end
in
a
corner
of
the
room
there
are
the
books
her
books
jan
he
said
softly
the
trembling
thrill
of
inspiration
in
his
voice
he
limped
across
the
room
dropped
upon
his
knees
before
the
box
and
drew
back
the
curtain
jan
knelt
beside
him
they
were
her
books
he
repeated
there
was
a
sobbing
catch
in
his
throat
and
his
head
fell
a
little
upon
his
breast
now
we
will
give
them
to
mélisse
he
drew
the
books
out
one
by
one
his
fingers
trembling
and
his
breath
coming
quickly
as
he
touched
them
a
dozen
worn
dusty
things
holding
within
them
more
than
john
cummins
would
ever
know
of
the
woman
he
had
lost
these
volumes
of
dead
voices
had
come
with
her
into
the
wilderness
from
that
other
world
she
had
known
they
breathed
the
pathos
of
her
love
from
out
of
their
ragged
pages
mended
in
a
hundred
places
to
keep
them
from
falling
into
utter
ruin
slowly
the
man
gathered
them
against
his
breast
and
held
them
there
silently
as
he
might
have
held
the
woman
fighting
hard
to
keep
back
his
grief
jan
thrust
a
hand
deeper
into
the
box
and
brought
forth
something
else
a
few
magazines
and
papers
as
ragged
and
worn
as
the
books
in
these
other
treasures
there
were
pictures
pictures
of
the
things
in
civilization
which
jan
had
never
seen
and
which
were
too
wonderful
for
him
to
comprehend
at
first
his
eyes
burned
excitedly
as
he
held
up
a
gaudily
covered
fashion
paper
to
john
cummins
theese
are
picture
for
mélisse
he
whispered
tensely
we
teach
her
we
show
her
we
mak
her
know
about
ceevilize
people
cummins
replaced
the
books
one
at
a
time
and
each
he
held
tenderly
for
a
moment
wiping
and
blowing
away
the
dust
gathered
upon
it
at
the
last
one
of
all
which
was
more
ragged
and
worn
than
the
others
he
gazed
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
little
bible
his
wife
bible
patched
pathetic
in
its
poverty
the
man
gulped
hard
she
loved
this
jan
he
said
huskily
she
loved
this
worn
old
book
more
than
anything
else
and
little
mélisse
must
love
it
also
mélisse
must
be
a
christian
ah
yes
ze
leetle
mélisse
mus
love
ze
great
god
said
jan
softly
cummins
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
sleeping
baby
a
missionary
is
coming
over
from
fort
churchill
to
talk
to
our
trappers
when
they
come
in
she
shall
be
baptized
like
a
cat
jan
was
on
his
feet
his
eyes
flashing
his
long
thin
fingers
clenched
his
body
quivering
with
a
terrible
excitement
no
no
not
baptize
by
missioner
he
cried
she
shall
be
good
love
ze
great
god
but
not
baptize
by
missioner
no
no
no
cummins
turned
upon
him
in
astonishment
before
him
jan
thoreau
stood
for
a
minute
like
one
gone
mad
his
whole
being
consumed
in
a
passion
terrible
to
look
upon
lithe
giant
of
muscle
and
fearlessness
that
he
was
cummins
involuntarily
drew
back
a
step
and
the
mainspring
of
instinct
within
him
prompted
him
to
lift
a
hand
as
if
to
ward
off
a
leaping
thing
from
his
breast
jan
noted
the
backward
step
the
guarded
uplift
of
hand
and
with
an
agonized
cry
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
in
another
instant
he
had
turned
and
before
cummins
startled
voice
found
words
had
opened
the
door
and
run
out
into
the
night
the
man
saw
him
darting
swiftly
toward
the
forest
and
called
to
him
but
there
was
no
response
there
was
a
hot
fire
burning
in
jan
brain
a
blazing
writhing
contortion
of
things
that
brought
a
low
moaning
from
his
lips
he
ran
tirelessly
and
swiftly
until
he
sank
down
upon
the
snow
in
a
silent
place
far
from
where
he
had
left
john
cummins
his
eyes
still
blazed
with
their
strange
fire
upon
the
desolation
about
him
his
fingers
clenched
and
unclenched
themselves
digging
their
nails
into
his
flesh
and
he
spoke
softly
to
himself
over
and
over
again
the
name
of
the
little
mélisse
painting
itself
each
instant
more
plainly
through
the
tumult
of
his
emotions
was
what
jan
had
come
to
know
as
the
picture
in
his
brain
shadowy
and
indistinct
at
first
in
pale
elusive
lines
of
mental
fabric
he
saw
the
picture
growing
and
in
its
growth
he
saw
first
the
soft
sweet
outlines
of
a
woman
face
and
then
great
luring
eyes
dark
like
his
own
and
before
these
eyes
which
gazed
upon
him
with
overwhelming
love
all
else
faded
away
from
before
jan
thoreau
the
fire
went
out
of
his
eyes
his
fingers
relaxed
and
after
a
little
while
he
got
up
out
of
the
snow
shivering
and
went
back
to
the
cabin
cummins
asked
no
questions
he
looked
at
jan
from
his
cot
and
watched
the
boy
silently
as
he
undressed
and
went
to
bed
and
in
the
morning
the
whole
incident
passed
from
his
mind
the
intangible
holds
but
little
fascination
for
the
simple
folk
who
live
under
the
arctic
circle
their
struggle
is
with
life
their
joys
are
in
its
achievement
in
their
constant
struggle
to
keep
life
running
strong
and
red
within
them
such
an
existence
of
solitude
and
of
strife
with
nature
leaves
small
room
for
curiosity
so
the
nature
of
john
cummins
led
him
to
forget
what
had
happened
as
he
would
have
forgotten
the
senseless
running
away
of
a
and
its
subsequent
return
he
saw
no
tragedy
and
no
promise
of
tragedy
in
the
thing
that
had
occurred
there
was
no
recurrence
of
the
strange
excitement
in
jan
he
gave
no
hint
of
it
in
word
or
action
and
the
thing
seemed
to
be
forgotten
between
the
two
the
education
of
the
little
mélisse
began
at
once
while
the
post
was
still
deserted
it
began
first
of
all
with
maballa
she
stared
dumbly
and
with
shattered
faith
at
these
two
creatures
who
told
her
of
wonderful
things
in
the
upbringing
of
a
child
things
of
which
she
had
never
so
much
as
heard
rumor
before
her
mother
instincts
were
aroused
but
with
cree
stoicism
she
made
no
betrayal
of
them
the
immobility
of
her
face
underwent
no
whit
of
change
when
cummins
solemnly
declared
that
the
little
mélisse
was
about
to
begin
teething
she
sat
grimly
and
watched
them
in
silence
when
between
them
upon
a
bearskin
stretched
on
the
floor
they
tried
vainly
to
persuade
mélisse
to
use
her
feet
it
was
great
fun
for
mélisse
and
she
enjoyed
it
immensely
so
that
as
the
days
passed
and
the
post
still
remained
deserted
john
cummins
and
jan
thoreau
spent
much
of
their
time
upon
their
knees
in
their
eyes
the
child
progress
was
remarkable
they
saw
in
her
an
unceasing
physical
growth
and
countless
symptoms
of
forthcoming
mental
development
she
delighted
to
pull
the
strings
of
jan
violin
which
was
an
unmistakable
token
of
her
musical
genius
she
went
into
ecstasies
over
the
gaudy
plates
in
the
fashion
paper
she
fingered
them
in
suggestive
and
inquiring
silence
or
with
still
more
suggestive
grunts
and
made
futile
efforts
to
eat
them
which
was
the
greatest
token
of
all
weeks
passed
and
williams
came
in
from
the
southern
forests
mukee
followed
him
from
the
edge
of
the
barrens
returned
from
the
eskimo
people
starved
and
with
half
of
his
dogs
stolen
from
the
north
east
west
and
south
the
post
trailed
back
life
was
resumed
there
was
a
softness
in
the
air
a
growing
warmth
in
the
midday
sun
the
days
of
the
big
change
were
near
and
when
they
came
john
cummins
and
jan
thoreau
of
all
the
people
wore
patches
at
their
knee
chapter
vi
days
of
triumph
one
afternoon
in
the
beginning
of
the
a
long
team
of
rakish
malemutes
driven
by
an
athabasca
raced
wildly
into
the
clearing
about
the
post
a
series
of
yells
and
the
wild
cracking
of
a
whip
announced
that
the
big
change
was
at
hand
that
the
wilderness
was
awakening
and
life
was
drawing
near
the
entire
post
rushed
out
to
meet
the
men
and
dogs
the
little
children
and
even
williams
fat
and
lethargic
wife
for
a
few
moments
there
was
a
scene
of
wild
disorder
of
fighting
malemutes
buried
under
a
rush
of
angry
huskies
while
men
shouted
and
the
yelling
frenchman
leaped
about
and
cut
his
in
vicious
slashes
over
the
wolfish
horde
around
his
heavily
laden
sledge
partial
order
being
restored
mukee
and
took
charge
of
the
snarling
malemutes
and
surrounded
by
williams
men
the
trapper
stalked
to
the
company
office
he
was
jean
de
gravois
the
most
important
man
in
the
fond
du
lac
country
for
whose
the
company
paid
a
small
bonus
that
he
had
made
a
record
catch
even
the
children
knew
by
the
size
of
the
packs
on
his
sledge
and
by
the
swagger
in
his
walk
gravois
was
usually
one
of
the
last
to
appear
at
the
annual
gathering
of
the
wilderness
he
was
a
big
man
in
reputation
as
he
was
small
in
stature
he
was
known
as
far
west
as
the
peace
river
and
eastward
to
fort
churchill
he
loved
to
make
his
appearance
at
the
post
in
a
wild
and
picturesque
rush
when
the
rest
of
the
forest
rovers
were
there
to
look
on
and
to
envy
or
admire
he
was
one
of
the
few
of
his
kind
who
had
developed
personal
vanity
along
with
unerring
cunning
in
the
ways
of
the
wild
everybody
liked
gravois
for
he
had
a
big
soul
in
him
and
was
as
fearless
as
a
lynx
and
he
liked
everybody
including
himself
he
explained
his
early
arrival
by
announcing
in
a
nonchalant
manner
that
after
he
had
given
his
malemutes
a
day
rest
he
was
going
on
to
fort
churchill
to
bring
back
a
wife
he
hinted
with
a
punctuating
crack
of
his
whip
that
he
would
make
a
second
visit
and
a
more
interesting
one
at
just
about
the
time
when
the
trappers
were
there
in
force
jan
thoreau
listened
to
him
hunching
his
shoulders
a
little
at
the
other
manifest
air
of
importance
in
turn
the
scrutinized
jan
neither
of
them
knew
the
part
which
jean
de
gravois
was
to
play
in
jan
life
every
hour
after
the
arrival
quickened
the
pulse
of
expectancy
at
the
post
for
six
months
it
had
been
a
small
and
solitary
unit
of
life
in
the
heart
of
a
big
desolation
the
first
snow
had
smothered
it
in
a
loneliness
that
was
almost
the
loneliness
of
desertion
with
that
first
snow
began
the
harvest
days
of
the
people
of
the
wilderness
far
and
wide
they
were
busy
along
their
their
lonely
shacks
hidden
in
the
shelter
of
thick
swamps
in
deep
chasms
and
dense
forests
for
six
months
the
short
days
and
the
long
nights
had
been
days
and
nights
of
during
those
months
the
post
was
silent
it
lived
and
breathed
but
that
was
all
its
life
for
williams
and
the
few
people
whom
the
company
kept
with
him
was
a
life
of
waiting
now
the
change
was
at
hand
it
was
like
the
breath
of
spring
to
the
awakening
wilderness
the
forest
people
were
moving
were
being
broken
shacks
abandoned
put
to
harness
on
the
day
that
jean
de
gravois
left
for
hudson
bay
the
company
supplies
came
in
from
fort
churchill
seven
toboggans
drawn
by
eskimo
dogs
laden
with
flour
and
cloth
fifty
pounds
of
beads
ammunition
and
a
hundred
other
things
to
be
exchanged
for
the
furs
that
would
soon
be
in
london
and
paris
fearfully
jan
thoreau
ran
out
to
meet
the
sledges
there
were
seven
indians
and
one
white
man
jan
thrust
himself
close
to
look
at
the
white
man
he
wore
two
and
carried
an
automatic
unquestionably
he
was
not
a
missionary
but
an
agent
of
the
company
well
prepared
to
care
for
the
company
treasure
jan
hurried
back
to
the
cabin
his
heart
bubbling
with
a
strange
joy
there
ees
no
missioner
mélisse
he
cried
triumphantly
dropping
beside
her
his
face
glowing
with
the
gladness
of
his
tidings
you
shall
be
good
and
beautiful
lak
her
but
you
shall
not
be
baptize
by
missioner
he
has
not
come
a
few
minutes
later
cummins
came
in
one
of
his
hands
was
torn
and
bleeding
those
eskimo
dogs
are
demons
he
growled
if
they
knew
how
to
stand
on
their
legs
they
eat
our
huskies
alive
will
you
help
me
with
this
jan
was
at
work
in
an
instant
bandaging
the
wounded
hand
it
ees
not
deep
he
said
and
then
without
looking
up
he
added
the
missioner
did
not
come
no
said
cummins
shortly
neither
has
the
mail
he
is
with
that
he
did
not
notice
the
sudden
tremble
of
jan
fingers
nor
did
he
see
the
startled
look
that
shot
into
the
boy
eyes
jan
finished
his
bandaging
without
betraying
his
emotion
and
went
back
with
cummins
to
the
company
store
the
next
morning
two
chippewayans
trailed
in
with
a
team
of
mongrel
curs
from
the
south
thereafter
cummins
found
but
little
time
to
devote
to
mélisse
the
snow
was
softening
rapidly
and
the
daily
increasing
warmth
of
the
sun
hastened
the
movement
of
the
trappers
mukee
people
from
the
western
barren
lands
arrived
first
bringing
with
them
great
loads
of
and
caribou
skins
and
an
army
of
mackenzie
hounds
that
pulled
like
horses
and
wailed
like
whipped
puppies
when
the
huskies
and
eskimo
dogs
set
upon
them
from
east
and
west
and
south
all
trails
now
led
to
the
post
by
the
end
of
the
third
day
after
the
arrival
of
the
company
supplies
a
babel
of
fighting
yelling
ceaselessly
moving
discord
had
driven
forth
the
peace
and
quiet
in
which
cummins
wife
had
died
the
fighting
and
discord
were
among
the
dogs
and
the
yelling
was
a
necessary
human
accompaniment
half
a
hundred
packs
almost
as
wild
and
as
savage
as
the
wolves
from
whom
half
of
them
possessed
a
strong
inheritance
of
blood
were
thrown
suddenly
into
warring
confusion
all
the
dogs
were
fighters
except
the
big
mackenzie
hounds
with
the
slow
strength
of
oxen
in
their
movements
and
the
and
mongrels
from
the
south
and
upon
these
unfortunates
the
others
preyed
packs
of
fierce
labrador
dogs
never
vanquished
except
by
death
came
from
close
to
hudson
bay
team
after
team
of
the
little
yellow
and
gray
eskimo
dogs
as
quick
with
their
fangs
as
were
their
black
and
masters
with
their
hands
and
feet
met
the
much
larger
and
malemutes
from
the
athabasca
enemies
of
all
these
fighting
snapping
and
snarling
with
the
lust
of
killing
deep
born
in
them
from
their
wolf
progenitors
packs
of
fierce
huskies
trailed
in
from
all
sides
there
was
no
cessation
in
the
battle
of
the
fangs
it
began
with
the
first
brute
arrivals
it
continued
from
dawn
through
the
day
and
around
the
campfires
at
night
there
was
never
an
end
to
the
strife
between
the
dogs
and
between
the
men
and
the
dogs
the
snow
was
stained
and
trailed
with
blood
and
the
scent
of
it
added
greater
fierceness
to
the
half
a
dozen
battles
were
fought
to
the
death
each
day
and
night
those
that
died
were
chiefly
the
curs
mixtures
of
mastiff
great
dane
and
and
the
fatally
slow
mackenzie
hounds
from
its
towering
height
the
sentinel
spruce
frowned
down
upon
the
savage
life
that
had
come
to
outrage
the
grave
it
guarded
yet
beyond
all
this
discord
and
bloody
strife
there
was
a
great
throbbing
human
happiness
a
beating
of
honest
hearts
filled
to
overflowing
with
the
joys
of
the
moment
a
welding
of
new
friendships
a
renewal
of
old
ones
a
closer
union
of
the
brotherhood
that
holds
together
all
things
under
the
cold
gray
of
the
northern
skies
there
were
no
bickerings
among
the
hunters
no
anger
of
man
against
man
in
the
fierce
voices
that
emphasized
the
slashing
cuts
of
the
if
the
fangs
of
a
hudson
bay
husky
let
out
the
from
the
soft
throat
of
a
mackenzie
hound
it
was
a
matter
of
the
dogs
and
not
of
their
owners
they
did
not
quarrel
one
day
a
fierce
eskimo
pack
cornered
a
giant
husky
under
the
big
spruce
and
slew
him
when
cummins
came
from
the
company
store
in
the
afternoon
he
saw
a
number
of
men
with
bared
heads
working
about
the
grave
he
drew
near
enough
to
see
that
they
were
building
around
it
a
barricade
of
saplings
and
his
breath
choked
him
as
he
turned
to
the
cabin
and
mélisse
he
noticed
too
that
no
fires
were
built
near
the
spot
consecrated
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
woman
and
to
his
cabin
the
paths
in
the
snow
became
deeper
and
wider
where
trod
the
wild
forest

who
came
to
look
upon
the
little
mélisse
these
were
days
of
unprecedented
prosperity
and
triumph
for
the

as
they
were
for
the

the

was
half
filled
with

things
for
all

came

something

there
were

down
by

this
homage
to

was
more
than
gratifying
it
formed

bond
between

his

went
out

went

the
caribou
carnival
jan
had
not
played
upon
his
violin
since
the
coming
of
jean
de
gravois
but
one
evening
he
tuned
his
strings
and
said
to
mélisse
they
have
been
good
to
you
my
mélisse
i
will
give
them
ze
museek
of
ze
violon
it
was
the
big
night
at
the
post
the
night
that
is
known
from
athabasca
to
hudson
bay
as
the
night
of
the
caribou
roast
a
week
had
passed
and
there
were
no
more
furs
to
be
disposed
of
in
the
ledger
each
man
had
received
his
credit
and
in
the
company
store
the
furs
were
piled
high
and
safe
three
caribou
had
been
killed
by
and
his
hunters
and
on
this
night
when
jan
took
down
his
violin
from
its
peg
on
the
wall
a
huge
fire
blazed
in
the
open
and
on
spits
six
inches
in
diameter
the
caribou
were
roasting
the
air
was
filled
with
the
sound
and
odor
of
the
carnival
above
the
fighting
and
snarling
of
dogs
the
forest
people
lifted
their
voices
in
wild
celebration
forgetting
in
this
one
holiday
of
the
year
the
silence
that
they
would
carry
back
into
the
solitudes
with
them
numbers
gave
them
courage
of
voice
and
in
its
manifestation
there
was
the
savagery
of
the
forests
that
hemmed
them
in
shrill
voices
rose
in
meaningless
cries
above
the
roaring
of
the
fire
caribou
whips
snapped
fiercely
chippewayans
crees
eskimos
and
breeds
crowded
in
the
red
glare
the
factor
men
shouted
and
sang
like
mad
for
this
was
the
company
annual
good
time
the
show
that
would
lure
many
of
these
same
men
back
again
at
the
end
of
another
trapping
season
huge
boxes
of
white
bread
were
placed
near
to
the
fire
a
tub
of
real
butter
brought
five
thousand
miles
from
across
the
sea
for
the
occasion
was
set
on
a
thrown
where
the
heat
played
upon
it
in
yellow
glory
in
a
giant
copper
kettle
over
a
smaller
fire
bubbled
and
steamed
half
a
barrel
of
coffee
the
richness
of
the
odors
that
drifted
in
the
air
set
the
dogs
gathering
upon
their
haunches
beyond
the
waiting
circle
of
masters
their
lips
dripping
their
fangs
snapping
in
an
eagerness
that
was
not
for
the
flesh
of
battle
and
above
it
all
there
gleamed
down
a
billion
stars
from
out
of
the
skies
the
aurora
flung
its
banners
through
the
pale
night
and
softly
the
smoke
rose
straight
up
and
then
floated
into
the
north
carried
there
by
the
gentle
breath
that
spring
was
luring
from
out
of
the
south
jan
picked
his
way
through
the
cordon
of
dogs
and
the
inner
circle
of
men
until
he
stood
with
the
firelight
flashing
in
his
glossy
hair
and
black
eyes
and
there
seated
upon
the
edge
of
one
of
the
he
began
to
play
it
was
not
the
low
sweet
music
of
cummins
and
the
little
mélisse
that
he
played
now
but
a
wild
wailing
song
that
he
had
found
in
the
autumn
winds
it
burst
above
the
crackling
fire
and
the
tumult
of
man
and
dog
in
a
weird
and
savage
beauty
that
hushed
all
sound
and
life
about
him
became
like
life
struck
suddenly
dead
with
his
head
bowed
jan
saw
nothing
saw
nothing
of
the
wonder
in
the
faces
of
the
little
black
men
who
were
squatted
in
a
group
a
dozen
feet
away
nothing
of
the
staring
amazement
in
the
eyes
that
were
looking
upon
this
miracle
he
was
performing
he
knew
only
that
about
him
there
was
a
deep
hush
and
after
a
while
his
violin
sang
a
lower
song
and
sweeter
and
still
softer
it
became
and
more
sweet
until
he
was
playing
that
which
he
loved
most
of
all
the
music
that
had
filled
the
little
cabin
when
cummins
wife
died
as
he
continued
to
play
there
came
an
interruption
to
the
silence
a
low
refrain
that
was
almost
like
that
of
the
moaning
wind
it
grew
beyond
the
tense
circle
of
men
until
a
song
of
infinite
sadness
rose
from
the
throats
of
a
hundred
dogs
in
response
to
jan
thoreau
violin
to
jan
it
was
like
the
song
of
life
the
unending
loneliness
and
grief
of
it
stirred
him
to
the
quick
of
his
soul
and
unconsciously
his
voice
rose
and
fell
softly
with
the
wailing
of
the
brute
chorus
but
to
the
others
it
was
a
thing
that
rose
portentous
above
their
understanding
a
miracle
of
mystery
that
smote
them
with
awe
even
as
they
surrendered
themselves
to
the
wonderful
sweetness
of
the
music
cummins
saw
the
change
in
his
people
and
understood
what
it
meant
he
saw
the
surrounding
cordon
become
thinner
as
man
crushed
closer
to
man
and
he
saw
strained
faces
turned
from
the
player
to
where
the
dogs
sat
upon
their
haunches
with
their
heads
pointed
straight
to
the
stars
in
the
sky
suddenly
he
burst
into
a
volume
of
wild
song
and
made
his
way
through
the
crouching
eskimos
to
for
the
love
of
heaven
play
no
more
of
that
he
cried
in
the
ear
play
something
fast
jan
lifted
his
head
as
if
from
a
dream
in
an
instant
he
perceived
the
strange
effect
of
his
music
and
his
bow
raced
across
the
strings
of
his
violin
in
a
rhythm
swift
and
buoyant
his
voice
rising
shrill
and
clear
in
words
familiar
to
them
all
oh

roas
on

broken
williams
and

and
the
rest
of
the
company
men
burst
forth
in
song
jan
violin
leaped
in
crescendos
of
stirring
sound
and
where
before
there
had
been
a
silent
circle
of
awestruck
men
there
was
now
a
yelling
din
of
voices
the
dogs
lowered
their
heads
again
and
licked
their
chops
at
the
odors
in
the
air
with
a
yell
mukee
and
three
crees
dashed
toward
the
fire
poles
in
their
hands
and
as
the
caribou
carcasses
were
turned
upon
their
huge
spits
and
their
dripping
fat
fell
sizzling
into
the
flames
the
wild
chorus
of
men
and
dogs
and
jan
violin
rose
higher
until
cummins
great
voice
became
only
a
whisper
in
the
tumult
the
third
caribou
had
been
twice
turned
upon
its
spit
and
mukee
and
his
crees
paused
in
waiting
silence
their
hooked
poles
gripping
the
long
bar
that
rested
horizontally
across
the
arms
of
two
stout
posts
driven
into
the
earth
close
to
the
fire
at
this
signal
there
was
a
final
outburst
from
the
waiting
horde
and
then
a
momentary
silence
fell
as
cummins
sprang
upon
one
of
the
and
waved
his
arms
frantically
above
his
head
now
he
shouted
now
with
eyes
flashing
with
excitement
jan
stood
before
cummins
and
his
violin
shrieked
out
the
wild
tune
to
a
still
wilder
response
of
untamed
voices
now
yelled
cummins
again
the
wilderness
song
that
was
known
from
athabasca
to
hudson

burst
forth
in
a
savage
enthusiasm

to

at

upon

turned
away
as

and
passed
beyond
the

of
waiting
dogs
to
restore
his
precious
violin
to
its
peg
on

the

within

and
for

time
since

had
come
to

spoke
no

found

and

returned
to

about

plunged
into

around
the

crowding
and
jostling
with
the

his
voice
rising
in
shrill
cries
as
he
forced
himself
through
to

edge
of

was
there
kneeling
with
sleeves
and
greasy
hands
beside
the
huge

when
he
saw
jan
he
stared
at
him
in
wonder
there
was
neither
laughter
nor
song
in

thoreau
voice
it
was
vibrant
with
a
strange
savageness
which
was
more
savage
than
the
wildest

of

and
his
great
eyes
burned
fiercely
as
they
rested
for
an
instant

him
and

reached

pulled
down

but
the

paid
no

close

chapter
viii
the
fight
at
dawn
for
a
few
moments
jan
stood
with
his
back
to
mélisse
and
his
eyes
upon
the
carnival
about
the
great
fire
as
he
looked
the
third
caribou
was
pulled
down
from
its
spit
and
the
multitude
of
dogs
rushed
in
upon
the
abandoned
carcasses
of
the
other
two
he
caught
his
breath
quickly
as
a
loud
shout
and
the
wailing
yelp
of
a
hurt
dog
rose
for
an
instant
above
all
other
sounds
only
one
thing
was
wanting
to
complete
another
picture
in
his
brain
a
scene
which
had
burned
itself
into
his
life
for
ever
and
which
he
strove
to
fight
back
as
he
stood
staring
from
the
doorway
he
half
expected
it
to
come
the
shrill
scream
of
a
boyish
voice
an
instant
sullen
quiet
then
the
thunder
of
impending
vengeance
and
the
fight
with
marvelous
quickness
his
excited
mind
reconstructed
the
scene
before
him
into
the
scene
that
had
been
he
heard
the
scream
again
which
had
been
his
voice
saw
as
if
in
a
dream
the
frenzied
rush
of
men
and
the
flash
of
knives
and
then
from
where
he
lay
trampled
and
bleeding
in
the
snow
the
long
lean
team
of
swift
huskies
that
had
carried
in
mad
flight
the
one
whose
life
those
knives
sought
williams
had
been
there
he
had
seen
the
fight
his
knife
had
flashed
with
the
others
in
its
demand
for
life
and
yet
he
jan
thoreau
had
not
been
recognized
by
the
factor
out
there
beside
the
caribou
roast
he
hurried
toward
the
fire
across
the
open
he
stopped
from
out
of
the
forest
opposite
cummins
cabin
there
trailed
slowly
a
team
of
dogs
in
the
shadows
of
the
spruce
hidden
from
the
revelers
the
team
halted
jan
heard
the
low
voices
of
men
and
a
figure
detached
itself
from
the
gloom
walking
slowly
and
in
the
manner
of
one
near
to
exhaustion
in
the
direction
of
the
carnival
it
was
a
new
team
it
had
come
from
the
trails
to
the
east
and
heart
gave
a
sudden
jump
as
he
thought
of
the
missionary
who
was
expected
with
the
overdue
mail
at
first
he
had
a
mind
to
intercept
the
figure
laboring
across
the
open
but
without
apparent
reason
he
changed
his
course
and
approached
the
sledge
as
he
came
nearer
he
observed
a
second
figure
which
rose
from
behind
the
dogs
and
advanced
to
meet
him
a
dozen
paces
ahead
of
the
team
it
stopped
and
waited
our
dogs
are
so
near
exhaustion
that
we
afraid
to
take
them
any
nearer
said
a
voice
they
die
like
puppies
under
those
packs
the
voice
thrilled
jan
he
advanced
with
his
back
to
the
fire
so
that
he
could
see
the
stranger
you
come
from
churchill
he
asked
his
words
were
hardly
a
question
they
were
more
of
an
excuse
for
him
to
draw
nearer
and
he
turned
a
little
so
that
for
an
instant
the
glowing
fire
flashed
in
his
eyes
yes
we
started
from
the
etawney
just
a
week
ago
jan
had
come
very
near
the
stranger
interrupted
himself
to
stare
into
the
thin
fierce
face
that
had
grown
like
a
white
cameo
almost
within
reach
of
him
with
a
startled
cry
he
drew
a
step
back
and
violin
dropped
to
the
snow
for
no
longer
than
a
breath
there
was
silence
the
man
wormed
himself
back
into
the
shadows
inch
by
inch
followed
by
the
white
face
of
the
boy
then
there
came
shrilly
from
jan
lips
the
mad
shrieking
of
a
name
and
his
knife
flashed
as
he
leaped
at
the
other
breast
the
stranger
was
quicker
than
he
with
a
sudden
movement
he
cleared
himself
of
the
blow
and
as
jan
arm
went
past
him
the
point
of
the
knife
ripping
his
he
shot
out
a
powerful
fist
and
sent
the
boy
reeling
to
the
ground
stunned
and
bleeding
jan
dragged
himself
to
his
knees
he
saw
the
dogs
turning
heard
a
low
voice
urging
them
to
the
trail
and
saw
the
sledge
disappear
into
the
forest
he
staggered
from
his
knees
to
his
feet
and
stood
swaying
in
his
weakness
then
he
followed
he
forgot
that
he
was
leaving
his
knife
in
the
snow
forgot
that
back
there
about
the
fire
there
were
other
dogs
and
other
men
he
only
knew
that
once
before
he
had
seen
a
sledge
slip
off
into
the
wilderness
that
its
going
had
left
him
a
life
of
hatred
and
bitterness
and
desire
for
vengeance
and
that
this
was
the
same
man
who
was
slipping
away
from
him
in
the
same
way
again
he
followed
sickened
by
the
blow
but
gaining
strength
as
he
pursued
ahead
of
him
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
toboggan
and
the
cautious
lashing
of
a
whip
over
the
backs
of
the
tired
huskies
the
sounds
filled
him
with
fierce
strength
he
wiped
away
the
warm
trickle
of
blood
that
ran
over
his
cheek
and
began
to
run
slowly
at
first
swinging
in
the
easy
of
the
forest
runner
with
his
elbows
close
to
his
sides
at
that
pace
he
could
have
followed
for
hours
losing
when
the
pack
took
a
spurt
gaining
when
they
lagged
an
insistent
nemesis
just
behind
when
the
weighted
dogs
lay
down
in
their
traces
but
there
was
neither
the
coolness
of
mukee
nor
the
cleverness
of
jean
de
gravois
in
the
manner
of
jan
running
when
he
heard
the
cracking
of
the
whip
growing
fainter
he
dropped
his
arms
straight
to
his
sides
and
ran
more
swiftly
his
brain
reeling
with
the
madness
of
his
desire
to
reach
the
sledge
to
drag
from
it
the
man
who
had
struck
him
to
choke
life
from
the
face
that
haunted
that
mental
picture
of
his
grinning
at
him
and
gloating
always
from
the
shadow
world
just
beyond
the
pale
sweet
loveliness
of
the
woman
who
lived
in
it
that
picture
came
to
him
now
as
he
ran
more
and
more
vividly
and
from
out
of
it
the
woman
urged
him
on
to
the
vengeance
which
she
demanded
of
him
her
great
eyes
glowing
like
fire
her
beautiful
face
torn
with
the
agony
which
he
had
last
seen
in
it
in
life
to
jan
thoreau
there
seemed
almost
to
come
from
that
face
a
living
voice
crying
to
him
its
prayer
for
retribution
pleading
with
him
to
fasten
his
lithe
brown
hands
about
the
throat
of
the
monster
upon
the
sledge
ahead
and
choke
from
it
all
life
it
drove
reason
from
him
leaving
him
with
the
one
thought
that
the
monster
was
almost
within
reach
and
he
replied
to
the
prayer
with
the
breath
that
came
in
moaning
exhaustion
from
between
his
lips
he
did
not
feel
the
soft
snow
under
the
beat
of
his
feet
he
received
the
lash
of
bushes
without
experiencing
the
sensation
of
their
sting
only
he
knew
that
he
wanted
air
more
and
more
air
and
to
get
it
he
ran
with
open
mouth
struggling
and
gasping
for
it
and
yet
not
knowing
that
jean
de
gravois
would
have
called
him
a
fool
for
the
manner
in
which
he
sought
it
he
heard
more
and
more
faintly
the
run
of
the
sledge
then
he
heard
it
no
longer
and
even
the
cracking
of
the
whip
died
away
his
heart
swelled
in
a
final
bursting
effort
and
he
plunged
on
until
at
last
his
legs
crumpled
under
him
and
he
pitched
face
downward
in
the
snow
like
a
thing
stung
by
sudden
death
it
was
then
with
his
scratched
and
bleeding
face
lying
in
the
snow
that
reason
began
to
return
to
him
after
a
little
while
he
dragged
himself
weakly
to
his
knees
still
panting
from
the
mad
effort
he
had
made
to
overtake
the
sledge
from
a
great
distance
he
heard
faintly
the
noise
of
shouting
the
whispering
echo
of
half
a
hundred
voices
and
he
knew
that
the
sound
came
from
the
revelers
at
the
post
it
was
proof
to
him
that
there
had
been
no
interruption
to
the
carnival
and
that
the
scene
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
had
been
witnessed
by
none
quickly
his
mental
faculties
readjusted
themselves
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
for
a
few
moments
stood
hesitatingly
he
had
no
weapon
but
as
his
hand
rested
upon
the
empty
at
his
belt
there
came
to
him
a
thought
of
the
way
in
which
mukee
had
avenged
cummins
wife
and
he
turned
again
upon
the
trail
he
no
longer
touched
the
bushes
he
was
no
more
than
a
shadow
appearing
and
disappearing
without
warning
trailing
as
the
white
ermine
follows
its
prey
noiseless
alert
his
body
responding
sinuously
and
without
apparent
effort
to
the
working
commands
of
his
brain
where
the
forest
broke
into
an
open
lighted
by
the
stars
he
found
blood
in
the
footprints
of
the
leading
dog
across
the
open
he
saw
where
the
leader
had
swung
out
from
the
trail
and
the
others
of
the
pack
had
crowded
about
him
to
be
urged
on
by
the
lashings
of
the
man
whip
other
signs
of
the
pack
growing
exhaustion
followed
close
the
man
now
traveled
beside
the
sledge
where
the
trail
was
rough
and
rode
where
it
was
smooth
and
hard
the
deep
imprints
of
his
heeled
boots
in
the
soft
snow
showed
that
he
ran
for
only
a
short
distance
at
a
time
a
hundred
yards
or
less
and
that
after
each
running
spell
he
brought
the
pack
to
a
walk
he
was
heavy
and
lacked
endurance
and
this
discovery
brought
a
low
cry
of
exultation
to
jan
lips
he
fell
into
a
mile
after
mile
dropped
behind
him
other
miles
were
ahead
of
him
an
endless
wilderness
of
miles
and
through
them
the
tired
pack
persisted
keeping
always
beyond
sound
and
vision
the
stars
began
fading
out
of
the
skies
the
shadows
of
the
forest
grew
deeper
and
blacker
and
where
the
aurora
had
lightened
the
heavens
there
crept
the
somber
gray
film
that
preceded
dawn
by
three
hours
jan
followed
more
and
more
slowly
there
was
effort
now
in
his
running
effort
that
caused
him
physical
pain
and
discomfort
his
feet
stumbled
occasionally
in
the
snow
his
legs
from
thigh
to
knee
began
to
ache
with
the
gnawing
torment
that
centers
in
the
marrowbone
and
with
this
beginning
of
the
runner
cramp
he
was
filled
with
a
new
and
poignant
terror
would
the
dogs
beat
him
out
sloughing
in
the
trail
bleeding
at
every
foot
would
they
still
drag
their
burden
beyond
the
reach
of
his
vengeance
the
fear
fastened
itself
upon
him
urging
him
to
greater
effort
and
he
called
upon
the
last
of
his
strength
in
a
spurt
that
carried
him
to
where
the
thick
spruce
gave
place
to
thin
bush
and
the
bush
to
the
barren
and
rocky
side
of
a
huge
ridge
up
which
the
trail
climbed
strong
and
well
defined
for
a
few
paces
he
followed
it
then
slipped
and
rolled
back
as
the
fatal
paralysis
deadened
all
power
of
movement
in
his
limbs
he
lay
where
he
fell
moaning
out
his
grief
with
his
eyes
turned
straight
up
into
the
cold
gray
of
the
starless
sky
for
a
long
time
he
was
motionless
from
the
top
of
the
ridge
where
the
trail
cut
over
the
mountain
he
looked
like
a
bit
of
wood
half
buried
in
the
snow
up
the
ridge
a
wolf
slinking
hungrily
sniffed
first
up
the
trail
and
then
down
and
broke
the
stillness
of
the
gray
with
a
mournful
howl
it
did
not
stir
jan
thoreau
long
after
the
wolf
had
passed
on
he
moved
a
little
twisting
himself
so
that
his
eyes
could
follow
the
tracks
made
by
the
sledge
and
dogs
when
he
came
to
where
the
backbone
of
the
ridge
cut
itself
in
faint
outline
against
the
desolate
coldness
of
the
sky
there
fell
from
him
the
first
sound
of
returning
life
up
there
he
was
sure
that
he
had
seen
something
move
an
object
which
at
first
he
had
taken
for
a
bush
and
which
he
knew
was
not
the
wolf
he
watched
for
its
reappearance
until
all
sorts
of
gray
dawn
shadows
danced
before
his
eyes
then
he
began
slowly
to
crawl
up
the
trail
some
of
the
dull
paralytic
ache
was
gone
from
his
limbs
and
as
he
worked
his
blood
began
to
warm
them
into
new
strength
until
he
stood
up
and
sniffed
like
an
animal
in
the
wind
that
was
coming
over
the
ridge
from
the
south
there
was
something
in
that
wind
that
thrilled
him
it
stung
his
nostrils
to
a
quick
sensing
of
the
nearness
of
something
that
was
human
he
smelled
smoke
in
it
there
was
the
pungent
odor
of
green
balsam
mixed
with
a
faint
perfume
of
pitch
pine
and
because
the
odor
of
pitch
grew
stronger
as
he
ascended
he
knew
that
it
was
a
small
fire
that
was
making
the
smoke
with
none
of
the
fierce
dry
woods
to
burn
up
the
smell
it
was
a
fire
hidden
among
the
rocks
a
tiny
fire
over
which
the
fleeing
missioner
was
cooking
his
breakfast
jan
almost
moaned
aloud
in
his
gladness
and
the
old
mad
strength
returned
to
his
body
near
the
summit
of
the
ridge
he
picked
up
a
club
it
was
a
short
thick
club
with
the
heavy
end
knotted
and
twisted
cautiously
he
lifted
his
face
over
the
rocks
and
looked
out
upon
a
plateau
still
deep
in
snow
swept
bare
by
the
winter
winds
and
covered
with
rocks
and
bushes
his
face
was
so
white
that
at
a
little
distance
it
might
have
been
taken
for
a
snow
hare
it
went
whiter
when
a
few
yards
away
he
saw
the
fire
the
man
and
the
dogs
the
man
was
close
to
the
little
blaze
his
broad
shoulders
hunched
over
steadying
a
small
pot
over
the
flame
beyond
him
were
the
dogs
huddled
about
the
sledge
inanimate
as
death
jan
drew
himself
over
the
rocks
once
he
had
seen
a
lynx
creep
upon
a
fox
and
like
that
lynx
he
crept
upon
the
man
beside
the
fire
one
of
the
tired
dogs
moved
and
his
pointed
nostrils
quivered
in
the
air
jan
lay
flat
in
the
snow
then
the
dog
muzzle
dropped
between
his
paws
and
the
boy
moved
on
inch
by
inch
he
advanced
the
inches
multiplied
themselves
into
a
foot
the
foot
lengthened
into
yards
and
still
the
man
remained
hunched
over
his
simmering
pot
jan
rose
gently
from
his
hands
and
knees
to
his
feet
a
furnace
of
madness
blazing
in
his
eyes
the
restless
dog
raised
his
head
again
he
sniffed
danger
near
menacing
danger
and
sprang
up
with
a
snarling
cry
that
brought
the
man
over
the
fire
to
quick
attention
in
a
flash
jan
took
the
last
leap
and
his
club
crashed
down
upon
the
head
the
man
pitched
over
like
a
log
and
with
a
shrill
cry
the
boy
was
at
his
throat
i
am
jan
thoreau
he
shrieked
i
am
jan
thoreau
jan
thoreau
come
to
keel
you
he
dropped
his
club
and
was
upon
the
man
chest
his
slender
fingers
tightening
like
steel
wire
about
the
thick
throat
of
his
enemy
i

slow
slow
he
cried
as
the
missioner
struggled
weakly
the
great
thick
body
heaved
under
him
and
he
put
all
his
strength
into
his
hands
something
struck
him
in
the
face
something
struck
him
again
and
again
but
he
felt
neither
the
pain
nor
the
force
of
it
and
his
voice
sobbed
out
his
triumph
as
he
choked
the
man
hands
reached
up
and
tore
at
his
hair
but
jan
saw
only
the
missioner
mottled
face
growing
more
mottled
and
his
eyes
staring
in
greater
agony
up
into
his
own
i

he
panted
again
and
again
i

jan
thoreau
an
i

keel

the
blood
poured
from
his
face
it
blinded
him
until
he
could
no
longer
see
the
one
from
which
he
was
choking
life
he
bent
down
his
head
to
escape
the
blows
the
man
body
heaved
more
and
more
it
turned
until
he
was
half
under
it
but
still
he
hung
to
the
thick
throat
as
the
weasel
hangs
in
tenacious
death
to
the
jugular
of
its
prey
the
missioner
weight
was
upon
him
in
crushing
force
now
his
huge
hands
struck
and
tore
at
the
boy
head
and
face
and
then
they
had
fastened
themselves
at
his
neck
jan
was
conscious
of
a
terrible
effort
to
take
in
breath
but
he
was
not
conscious
of
pain
the
clutch
did
not
frighten
him
it
did
not
make
him
loosen
his
grip
his
fingers
dug
deeper
he
strove
to
cry
out
still
his
words
of
triumph
but
he
could
make
no
sound
except
a
gasping
like
that
which
came
from
between
the
gaping
jaws
of
the
man
whose
life
his
body
and
soul
were
fighting
to
smother
there
was
death
in
each
of
the
two
grips
but
the
man
was
the
stronger
and
his
neck
was
larger
and
tougher
so
that
after
a
time
he
staggered
to
his
knees
and
then
to
his
feet
while
jan
lay
upon
his
back
his
face
and
hair
red
with
blood
his
eyes
wide
open
and
with
a
lifeless
glare
in
them
the
missioner
looked
down
upon
his
victim
in
horror
as
the
life
that
had
nearly
ebbed
out
of
him
poured
back
into
his
body
he
staggered
among
the
dogs
fastened
them
to
the
sledge
and
urged
them
down
the
mountain
into
the
plain
there
was
soon
no
sound
of
the
sledge
from
a
bush
a
dozen
yards
away
a
wondering
had
watched
the
terrible
struggle
now
he
hopped
boldly
upon
jan
motionless
body
and
perked
his
head
inquisitively
as
he
examined
the
strange
face
covered
with
blood
and
twisted
in
torture
the
gray
film
of
dawn
dissolved
itself
into
the
white
beginning
of
day
far
to
the
south
a
bit
of
the
red
sunrise
was
creeping
into
the
northern

a

down
the

jean
he
caught
jan
limp
head
and
shoulders
up
in
his
arms
and
called
shrilly
to
iowaka
who
was
disentangling
herself
from
the
thick
furs
in
which
he
had
wrapped
her
it
is
the
fiddler
i
told
you
about
who
lives
with
williams
at
post
lac
bain
he
shouted
excitedly
in
cree
he
has
been
murdered
he
has
been
choked
to
death
and
torn
to
pieces
in
the
face
as
if
by
an
animal
jean
eyes
roved
about
as
iowaka
kneeled
beside
him
what
a
fight
he
gasped
see
the
footprints
a
big
man
and
a
small
boy
and
the
murderer
has
gone
on
a
sledge
he
is
warm
said
iowaka
it
may
be
that
he
is
not
dead
jean
de
gravois
sprang
to
his
feet
his
little
black
eyes
flashing
with
a
dangerous
fire
in
a
single
leap
he
was
at
the
side
of
the
sledge
throwing
off
the
furs
and
bundles
and
all
other
objects
except
his
rifle
he
is
dead
iowaka
look
at
the
purple
and
black
in
his
face
it
is
jean
de
gravois
who
will
catch
the
murderer
and
you
will
stay
here
and
make
yourself
a
camp
he
shouted
to
the
malemutes
the
team
twisted
sinuously
and
swiftly
in
the
trail
as
he
sped
over
the
edge
of
the
mountain
upon
the
plain
below
he
knelt
upon
the
toboggan
with
his
rifle
in
front
of
him
and
at
his
low
hissing
commands
which
reached
no
farther
than
the
dogs
ears
the
team
stretched
their
long
bodies
in
pursuit
of
the
missioner
and
his
huskies
jean
knew
that
whoever
was
ahead
of
him
was
not
far
away
and
he
laughed
and
hunched
his
shoulders
when
he
saw
that
his
magnificent
malemutes
were
making
three
times
the
speed
of
the
huskies
it
was
a
short
chase
it
led
across
the
narrow
plain
and
into
a
dense
tangle
of
swamp
where
the
huskies
had
picked
their
way
in
aimless
wandering
until
they
came
out
in
thick
balsam
and
banksian
pine
half
a
mile
farther
on
and
the
trail
broke
into
an
open
which
led
down
to
the
smooth
surface
of
a
lake
and
across
the
lake
was
the
fleeing
missioner
the
malemute
leader
flung
open
his
jaws
in
a
deep
baying
triumph
and
with
a
savage
yell
jean
cracked
his
caribou
whip
over
his
back
he
saw
the
man
ahead
of
him
lean
over
the
end
of
his
sledge
as
he
urged
his
dogs
but
the
huskies
went
no
faster
and
then
he
caught
the
glitter
of
something
that
flashed
for
a
moment
in
the
sun
ah
said
jean
softly
as
a
bullet
sang
over
his
head
he
fires
at
jean
de
gravois
he
dropped
his
whip
and
there
was
the
warm
glow
of
happiness
in
his
little
dark
face
as
he
leveled
his
rifle
over
the
backs
of
his
malemutes
he
fires
at
jean
de
gravois
and
it
is
jean
who
can
hamstring
a
caribou
at
three
hundred
yards
on
the
run
for
an
instant
at
the
crack
of
his
rifle
there
was
no
movement
ahead
then
something
rolled
from
the
sledge
and
lay
doubled
up
in
the
snow
a
hundred
yards
beyond
it
the
huskies
stopped
in
a
rabble
and
turned
to
look
at
the
approaching
strangers
beside
it
jean
stopped
and
when
he
saw
the
face
that
stared
up
at
him
he
clutched
his
thin
hands
in
his
long
black
hair
and
cried
out
in
shrill
amazement
and
horror
the
saints
in
heaven
it
is
the
missioner
from
churchill
he
turned
the
man
over
and
found
where
his
bullet
had
entered
under
one
arm
and
come
out
from
under
the
other
there
was
no
spark
of
life
left
the
missioner
was
already
dead
the
missioner
from
churchill
he
gasped
again
he
looked
up
at
the
warm
sun
and
kicked
the
melting
snow
under
his
moccasined
feet
it
will
thaw
very
soon
he
said
to
himself
looking
again
at
the
dead
man
and
then
he
will
go
into
the
lake
he
headed
his
malemutes
back
to
the
forest
then
he
ran
out
and
cut
the
traces
of
the
exhausted
huskies
and
with
his
whip
scattered
them
in
freedom
over
the
ice
go
to
the
wolves
he
shouted
in
cree
hide
yourselves
from
the
post
or
jean
de
gravois
will
cut
out
your
tongues
and
take
your
skins
off
alive
when
he
came
back
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
jean
found
iowaka
making
hot
coffee
while
jan
was
bundled
up
in
furs
near
the
fire
it
is
as
i
said
she
called
he
is
alive
thus
it
happened
that
the
return
of
jean
de
gravois
to
the
post
was
even
more
dramatic
than
he
had
schemed
it
to
be
for
he
brought
back
with
him
not
only
a
beautiful
wife
from
churchill
but
also
the
half
dead
jan
thoreau
from
the
scene
of
battle
on
the
mountain
and
in
the
mystery
of
it
all
he
reveled
for
two
days
for
jean
de
gravois
said
not
a
word
about
the
dead
man
on
the
lake
beyond
the
forest
nor
did
the
huskies
come
back
into
their
bondage
to
give
a
hint
of
the
missing
missionary
chapter
x
red
from
the
day
after
the
caribou
roast
the
began
scattering
the
eskimos
left
the
next
morning
on
the
second
day
mukee
people
from
the
west
set
off
along
the
edge
of
the
barrens
most
of
the
others
left
by
ones
and
twos
into
the
wildernesses
to
the
south
and
east
less
than
a
dozen
still
put
off
their
return
to
the
late
spring
trapping
and
among
these
were
jean
de
gravois
and
his
wife
jean
waited
until
the
third
day
then
he
went
to
see
jan
the
boy
was
bolstered
up
in
his
cot
with
cummins
balancing
the
little
mélisse
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
when
he
came
in
for
a
time
jean
sat
and
watched
them
in
silence
then
he
made
a
sign
to
cummins
who
joined
him
at
the
door
i
am
going
the
athabasca
way
he
said
i
wish
to
talk
with
the
boy
before
i
go
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
him
which
no
ears
should
hear
but
his
own
will
it
be
right
talk
to
him
as
long
as
you
like
said
cummins
but
do
worry
him
about
the
missionary
you
not
get
a
word
from
him
jan
eyes
spoke
with
a
devotion
greater
than
words
as
jean
de
gravois
came
and
sat
close
beside
him
he
knew
that
it
was
jean
who
had
brought
him
alive
into
the
post
and
now
there
was
something
in
the
suggestive
grimacing
of
the
frenchman
face
and
in
the
eagerness
with
which
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
if
he
was
not
quite
sure
but
that
the
walls
held
ears
that
caused
the
boy
heart
to
beat
a
little
faster
as
he
speculated
upon
what
jean
was
going
to
say
for
a
few
moments
jean
looked
at
the
other
steadily
with
his
thin
black
face
propped
in
his
hands
and
a
curious
smile
on
his
lips
he
twisted
his
face
into
a
dozen
expressions
of
a
language
as
voluble
as
that
of
his
tongue
hunched
his
shoulders
up
to
his
ears
as
he
grinned
at
jan
and
chuckled
between
his
grimaces
ah
it
was
wan
fight
he
said
softly
you
are
a
brave
boy
jan
thoreau
you
did
not
see
it
asked
unconsciously
the
words
came
from
him
in
french
jean
caught
one
of
his
thin
hands
and
laughed
joyfully
for
the
spirit
of
him
was
french
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
i
see
it
no
neither
i
nor
iowaka
but
there
it
was
in
the
snow
as
plain
as
the
eyes
in
your
face
and
did
i
not
follow
the
trail
that
staggered
down
the
mountain
while
iowaka
brought
you
back
to
life
and
when
i
came
to
the
lake
did
i
not
see
something
black
out
upon
it
like
a
charred
log
and
when
i
came
to
it
was
it
not
the
dead
body
of
the
missioner
from
churchill
eh
jan
thoreau
jan
sat
up
in
his
bed
with
a
sharp
cry
admonished
jean
pressing
him
back
gently
there
is
no
need
of
telling
what
is
out
there
on
the
lake
only
the
blessed
virgin
made
me
dream
last
night
that
you
would
like
to
see
with
your
own
eyes
that
the
missioner
is
dead
the
thaw
will
open
up
the
lake
in
a
few
days
then
he
will
go
down
in
the
first
slush
and
jean
looked
about
him
cautiously
again
and
whispered
low
if
you
see
anything
about
the
dead
missioner
that
you
do
not
understand
think
of
jean
de
gravois
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
bent
over
jan
white
face
i
am
going
the
athabasca
way
he
finished
perhaps
jan
thoreau
you
will
hear
after
a
time
that
it
would
be
best
for
jean
de
gravois
never
to
return
again
to
this
post
lac
bain
if
so
you
will
find
him
between
fond
du
lac
and
the
beaver
river
and
you
can
make
it
in
four
days
by
driving
your
dogs
close
to
the
of
the
barrens
keeping
always
where
you
can
see
the
to
the
north
he
turned
to
the
door
and
hesitated
there
for
a
moment
smiling
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
jean
de
gravois
wonders
if
jan
thoreau
understands
he
said
and
passed
out
when
cummins
returned
he
found
jan
cheeks
flushed
and
the
boy
in
a
fever
devil
take
that
gravois
he
growled
he
has
been
a
brother
to
me
said
jan
simply
i
love
him
on
the
second
day
after
the
frenchman
departure
jan
rose
free
of
the
fever
which
had
threatened
him
for
a
time
and
in
the
afternoon
he
harnessed
cummins
dogs
the
last
of
the
trappers
had
started
from
the
post
that
morning
their
sledges
and
dogs
sinking
heavily
in
the
deepening
slush
and
jan
set
off
over
the
smooth
toboggan
trail
made
by
the
company
agent
in
his
return
to
fort
churchill
this
trail
followed
close
along
the
base
of
the
ridge
upon
which
he
had
fought
the
missionary
joining
that
of
jean
de
gravois
miles
beyond
jan
climbed
the
ridge
from
where
he
had
made
his
attack
he
followed
the
almost
obliterated
trail
of
the
frenchman
and
his
malemutes
until
he
came
to
the
lake
and
then
he
knew
that
jean
de
gravois
had
spoken
the
truth
for
he
found
the
missionary
with
his
face
half
buried
in
the
slush
stark
dead
he
no
longer
had
to
guess
at
the
meaning
of
jean
words
the
under
the
dead
man
arms
was
too
large
to
escape
eyes
like
jan
into
the
little
hidden
world
which
he
treasured
in
his
heart
there
came
another
face
to
remain
always
with
him
the
face
of
the
courageous
little
forest
dandy
who
was
hurrying
with
his
bride
back
into
the
country
of
the
athabasca
jan
allowed
his
dogs
to
walk
all
the
way
back
to
the
post
and
it
was
dusk
before
they
arrived
maballa
had
prepared
supper
and
cummins
was
waiting
for
him
he
glanced
sharply
at
the
boy
there
was
a
smile
on
jan
lips
and
there
was
something
in
his
eyes
which
cummins
had
never
seen
there
before
from
that
night
they
were
no
longer
filled
with
the
nervous
glittering
flashes
which
at
times
had
given
him
an
appearance
almost
of
madness
in
place
of
their
searching
suspicions
there
was
a
warmer
and
more
companionable
glow
and
cummins
felt
the
effect
of
the
change
as
he
ate
his
caribou
steak
and
talked
once
more
entirely
of
mélisse
a
cree
trapper
had
found
jan
violin
in
the
snow
and
had
brought
it
to
maballa
before
cummins
finished
his
supper
the
boy
began
to
play
and
he
continued
to
play
until
the
lights
at
the
post
went
out
and
both
the
man
and
the
child
were
deep
in
sleep
then
jan
stopped
there
was
the
fire
of
a
keen
wakefulness
in
his
eyes
as
he
carefully
unfastened
the
strings
of
his
instrument
and
held
it
close
to
the
oil
lamp
so
that
he
could
peer
down
through
the
narrow
aperture
in
the
box
he
looked
again
at
cummins
the
man
was
sleeping
with
his
face
to
the
wall
with
the
hooked
wire
which
he
used
for
cleaning
his
revolver
jan
fished
gently
at
the
very
end
of
the
box
and
after
three
or
four
efforts
the
wire
caught
in
something
soft
which
he
pulled
toward
him
through
the
bulge
in
the
he
dragged
forth
a
small
tightly
rolled
cylinder
of
faded
red
cloth
for
a
few
moments
he
sat
watching
the
deep
breathing
of
cummins
unrolling
the
cloth
as
he
watched
until
he
had
spread
out
upon
the
table
before
him
a
number
of
closely
written
pages
of
paper
he
weighted
them
at
one
end
with
his
violin
and
held
them
down
at
the
other
with
his
hands
the
writing
was
in
french
several
of
the
pages
were
in
a
heavy
masculine
hand
the
words
running
one
upon
another
so
closely
that
in
places
they
seemed
to
be
connected
and
from
them
jan
took
his
fingers
so
that
they
rolled
up
like
a
spring
over
the
others
he
bent
his
head
and
there
came
from
him
a
low
sobbing
breath
on
these
pages
the
writing
was
that
of
a
woman
and
from
the
paper
there
still
rose
a
faint
sweet
scent
of
heliotrope
for
half
an
hour
jan
gazed
upon
them
reading
the
words
slowly
until
he
came
to
the
last
page
when
there
came
a
movement
from
over
against
the
wall
he
lifted
for
an
instant
a
pair
of
startled
eyes
cummins
was
turning
in
his
sleep
soundlessly
jan
tiptoed
across
the
floor
opened
the
door
without
disturbing
the
slumbering
man
and
went
out
into
the
night
in
the
south
and
east
there
glowed
a
soft
blaze
of
fire
where
the
big
spring
moon
was
coming
up
over
the
forest
as
jan
turned
his
face
toward
it
a
new
and
strange
longing
crept
into
his
heart
he
stretched
out
his
arms
with
the
papers
and
his
violin
clutched
in
his
hands
as
if
from
out
of
that
growing
glory
a
wonderful
spirit
was
calling
to
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
lonely
life
it
came
to
him
this
call
of
the
great
world
beyond
the
wilderness
and
suddenly
he
crushed
the
letter
to
his
lips
and
his
voice
burst
from
him
in
whispering
thrilling
eagerness
i
will
come
to
you
some
day
ze
leetle
mélisse
come
too
he
rolled
the
written
pages
together
wrapped
them
in
the
faded
red
cloth
and
concealed
them
again
in
the
box
of
his
violin
before
he
reentered
the
cabin
the
next
morning
cummins
stood
in
the
door
and
said
how
warm
the
sun
is
the
snow
and
ice
are
going
jan
it
spring
we
house
the
sledges
and
begin
feeding
the
dogs
on
fish
each
day
thereafter
the
sun
rose
earlier
the
day
was
longer
and
the
air
was
warmer
and
with
the
warmth
there
now
came
the
sweet
scents
of
the
budding
earth
and
the
myriad
sounds
of
the
deep
unseen
life
of
the
forest
awakening
from
its
long
slumber
in
its
bed
of
snow
chirped
their
mating
songs
and
flirted
from
morning
until
night
in
bough
and
air
ravens
fluffed
themselves
in
the
sun
and
snowbirds
little
beauties
that
were
wont
to
whisk
about
like
so
many
flashing
gems
changed
their
color
from
day
to
day
until
they
became
new
creatures
in
a
new
world
the
poplar
buds
swelled
in
their
joy
until
they
split
like
over
fat
peas
the
mother
bears
come
out
of
their
winter
dens
accompanied
by
little
ones
born
weeks
before
and
taught
them
how
to
pull
down
the
slender
saplings
for
these
same
buds
the
moose
returned
from
the
blizzardy
tops
of
the
great
ridges
where
for
good
reasons
they
had
passed
the
winter
followed
by
the
wolves
who
fed
upon
their
weak
and
sick
everywhere
were
the
rushing
torrents
of
melting
snow
the
crackle
of
crumbling
ice
the
dying
of
rock
and
earth
and
tree
and
each
night
the
pale
glow
of
the
aurora
borealis
crept
farther
and
farther
toward
the
pole
in
its
fading
glory
the
post
fell
back
into
its
old
ways
now
and
then
a
visitor
came
in
from
out
of
the
forest
but
he
remained
for
only
a
day
or
two
taking
back
into
the
solitude
with
him
a
few
of
the
necessaries
of
life
williams
was
busy
preparing
his
books
for
the
coming
of
the
chief
agent
from
london
and
cummins
who
was
helping
the
factor
had
a
good
deal
of
extra
time
on
his
hands
before
the
last
of
the
snow
was
gone
he
and
jan
began
dragging
in
logs
for
an
addition
which
they
planned
for
the
little
cabin
basking
out
in
the
sun
with
a
huge
bearskin
for
a
floor
mélisse
looked
upon
the
new
with
wonderful
demonstrations
of
interest
cummins
face
glowed
with
pleasure
as
she
kicked
and
scrambled
on
the
bearskin
and
gave
approval
of
their
efforts
jan
was
the
happiest
youth
in
the
world
it
was
certain
that
the
little
mélisse
understood
what
they
were
doing
and
the
word
passed
from
cummins
and
jan
to
the
others
at
the
post
so
that
it
happened
frequently
during
the
building
operations
that
mukee
and
and
even
williams
himself
would
squat
for
an
hour
at
a
time
in
the
snow
near
mélisse
marveling
at
the
early
knowledge
which
the
great
god
saw
fit
to
put
into
a
white
baby
brain
this
miracle
came
to
be
a
matter
of
deep
discussion
in
which
there
were
the
few
words
but
much
thought
of
men
born
to
silence
one
day
mukee
brought
two
little
indian
babies
and
set
them
on
the
bearskin
where
they
continued
to
sit
in
stoic
indifference
a
clear
proof
of
the
superior
development
of
mélisse
i
would
be
surprised
to
hear
her
begin
talking
at
any
time
confided
cummins
to
jan
one
evening
when
the
boy
was
tuning
his
violin
she
is
nearly
six
months
old
do
you
suppose
she
would
begin
in
french
asked
jan
suddenly
stopping
the
tightening
of
his
strings
cummins
stared
why
jan
dropped
his
voice
to
an
impressive
whisper
because
i
have
heard
her
many
times
say
bonbon
bonbon
which
means
candee
and
always
i
have
given
her
candee
an
now
ze
leetle
mélisse
say
all
of
ze
time
well
said
cummins
eying
him
in
half
belief
could
it
happen
like
a
shot
jan
replied
i
began
in
engleesh
an
jan
thoreau
is
french
he
began
playing
but
cummins
did
not
hear
much
of
the
music
he
went
to
the
door
and
stared
in
lonely
grief
at
the
top
of
the
tall
spruce
over
the
grave
later
he
said
to
jan
it
would
be
bad
if
that
were
so
give
her
no
more
sweet
stuff
when
she
says
she
must
forget
the
next
day
jan
tore
down
the
sapling
barricade
around
the
grave
and
from
noon
until
almost
sunset
he
skirted
the
sunny
side
of
a
great
ridge
to
the
south
when
he
came
back
he
brought
with
him
a
basket
of
the
early
red
with
earth
clinging
to
their
roots
these
he
planted
thickly
over
the
mound
under
the
spruce
and
around
its
edge
he
put
rows
of
the
young
shoots
of
labrador
tea
and
backneesh
as
the
weather
grew
warmer
and
spring
changed
into
summer
he
took
mélisse
upon
short
excursions
with
him
into
the
forests
and
together
they
picked
great
armfuls
of
flowers
and
arctic
ferns
the
grave
was
never
without
fresh
offerings
and
the
cabin
with
its
new
addition
complete
was
always
filled
with
the
beautiful
things
that
spring
up
out
of
the
earth
jan
and
mélisse
were
happy
and
in
the
joys
of
these
two
there
was
pleasure
for
the
others
of
the
post
as
there
had
been
happiness
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
only
upon
cummins
had
there
settled
a
deep
grief
the
changes
of
spring
and
summer
bringing
with
them
all
that
this
desolate
world
held
of
warmth
and
beauty
filled
him
with
the
excruciating
pain
of
his
great
grief
as
if
the
woman
had
died
but
yesterday
when
he
first
saw
the
red
flowers
glowing
upon
her
grave
he
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
and
sobbed
like
a
child
the
woman
had
loved
them
she
had
always
watched
for
the
first
red
blooms
to
shoot
up
out
of
the
wet
earth
a
hundred
times
he
had
gone
with
her
to
search
for
them
and
had
fastened
the
first
flower
in
the
soft
beauty
of
her
hair
those
were
the
days
when
like
happy
children
they
had
romped
and
laughed
together
out
there
beyond
the
black
spruce
often
he
had
caught
her
up
in
his
strong
arms
and
carried
her
tired
and
hungry
but
gloriously
happy
back
to
their
little
home
in
the
clearing
where
she
would
sit
and
laugh
at
him
as
he
clumsily
prepared
their
supper
thoughts
and
pictures
like
these
choked
him
and
drove
him
off
alone
into
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
when
this
spirit
impelled
him
his
moccasined
feet
would
softly
tread
the
paths
they
had
taken
in
their
wanderings
and
at
every
turn
a
new
memory
would
spring
up
before
him
and
he
longed
to
fling
himself
down
there
with
the
sweet
spirit
of
the
woman
and
die
little
did
he
dream
at
these
times
that
jan
and
mélisse
were
to
cherish
these
same
paths
that
out
of
the
old
dead
joys
there
were
to
spring
new
joys
and
that
the
new
joys
were
to
wither
and
die
even
as
his
own
for
a
time
beyond
his
own
great
sorrow
he
saw
nothing
in
the
future
he
gave
up
mélisse
to
at
last
his
gaunt
frame
thinned
by
sleepless
nights
and
days
of
mental
torture
he
said
that
the
company
business
was
calling
him
to
churchill
and
early
in
august
he
left
for
the
bay
chapter
xi
for
her
upon
jan
now
fell
a
great
responsibility
mélisse
was
his
own
days
passed
before
he
could
realize
the
fullness
of
his
possession
he
had
meant
to
go
by
the
athabasca
water
route
to
see
jean
de
gravois
leaving
mélisse
to
cummins
for
a
fortnight
or
so
now
he
gave
this
up
day
and
night
he
guarded
the
child
and
to
jan
great
joy
it
soon
came
to
pass
that
whenever
he
was
compelled
to
leave
her
for
a
short
time
mélisse
would
cry
for
him
at
least
maballa
assured
him
that
this
was
so
and
mélisse
gave
evidence
of
it
by
her
ecstatic
joy
when
he
returned
when
cummins
came
back
from
fort
churchill
in
the
autumn
he
brought
with
him
a
pack
full
of
things
for
mélisse
including
new
books
and
papers
for
which
he
had
spent
a
share
of
his
season
earnings
as
he
was
freeing
these
treasures
from
their
wrapping
of
soft
caribou
skin
with
jan
and
mélisse
both
looking
on
he
stopped
suddenly
and
glanced
from
his
knees
up
at
the
boy
they
wondering
over
at
churchill
what
became
of
the
missionary
who
left
with
the
mail
jan
they
say
he
was
last
seen
at
the
etawney
and
not
here
replied
jan
quickly
not
that
they
know
of
said
cummins
still
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
boy
the
man
who
drove
him
never
got
back
to
churchill
wondering
where
the
driver
went
too
a
company
officer
has
gone
up
to
the
etawney
and
it
is
possible
he
may
come
over
to
lac
bain
i
believe
he
find
the
missionary
neither
do
i
said
jan
quite
coolly
he
is
probably
dead
and
the
wolves
and
foxes
have
eaten
him
before
this
or
mebby
ze
feesh
cummins
resumed
his
task
of
unpacking
and
among
the
books
which
he
brought
forth
there
were
two
which
he
gave
to
the
supply
ship
from
london
came
in
while
i
was
at
churchill
and
those
came
with
it
he
explained
they
there
going
to
be
a
school
at
churchill
next
winter
and
the
winter
after
that
it
will
be
at
york
factory
down
on
the
hayes
he
settled
back
on
his
heels
and
looked
at
it
the
first
school
that
has
ever
come
nearer
than
four
hundred
miles
of
us
that
at
prince
albert
for
many
succeeding
days
jan
took
long
walks
alone
in
the
forest
trails
and
silently
thrashed
out
the
two
problems
which
cummins
had
brought
back
from
churchill
for
him
should
he
warn
jean
de
gravois
that
a
company
officer
was
investigating
the
disappearance
of
the
missionary
at
first
his
impulse
was
to
go
at
once
into
jean
haunts
beyond
the
fond
du
lac
and
give
him
the
news
but
even
if
the
officer
did
come
to
post
lac
bain
how
would
he
know
that
the
missionary
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
and
that
jean
de
gravois
was
accountable
for
it
so
in
the
end
jan
decided
that
it
would
be
folly
to
stir
up
the
little
fears
and
he
thought
no
more
of
the
company
investigator
who
had
gone
up
to
the
etawney
but
the
second
problem
was
one
whose
perplexities
troubled
him
cummins
word
of
the
school
at
churchill
had
put
a
new
and
thrilling
thought
into
his
head
and
always
with
that
thought
he
coupled
visions
of
the
growing
mélisse
this
year
the
school
would
be
at
churchill
and
the
next
at
york
factory
and
after
that
it
might
be
gone
for
ever
so
that
when
mélisse
grew
up
there
would
be
none
nearer
than
what
jan
looked
upon
as
the
other
end
of
the
world
why
could
not
he
go
to
school
for
mélisse
and
store
up
treasures
which
in
time
he
might
turn
over
to
her
the
scheme
was
a
colossal
one
by
all
odds
the
largest
that
had
ever
entered
into
his
dreams
of
what
life
held
for
him
that
he
jan
thoreau
should
learn
to
read
and
write
and
do
other
things
like
the
people
of
the
far
south
so
that
he
might
help
to
make
the
little
creature
in
the
cabin
like
her
who
slept
under
the
watchful
spruce
he
was
stirred
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
now
with
fear
again
with
hope
and
desire
and
ambition
and
it
was
not
until
the
first
cold
chills
of
approaching
winter
crept
down
from
the
north
and
east
that
the
ultimate
test
came
and
he
told
cummins
of
his
intention
once
his
mind
was
settled
jan
lost
no
time
in
putting
his
plans
into
action
mukee
knew
the
trail
to
churchill
and
agreed
to
leave
with
him
on
the
third
day
which
gave
williams
wife
time
to
make
him
a
new
coat
of
caribou
skin
on
the
second
evening
he
played
for
the
last
time
in
the
little
cabin
and
after
mélisse
had
fallen
asleep
he
took
her
up
gently
in
his
arms
and
held
her
there
for
a
long
time
while
cummins
looked
on
in
silence
when
he
replaced
her
in
the
little
bed
against
the
wall
cummins
put
one
of
his
long
arms
about
the
boy
shoulders
and
led
him
to
the
door
where
they
stood
looking
out
upon
the
grim
desolation
of
the
forest
that
rose
black
and
silent
against
the
starlit
background
of
the
sky
high
above
the
thick
tops
of
the
spruce
rose
the
lone
tree
over
the
grave
like
a
dark
finger
pointing
up
into
the
night
and
cummins
eyes
rested
there
she
heard
you
first
that
night
jan
he
spoke
softly
she
knew
that
you
were
coming
long
before
i
could
hear
anything
but
the
crackling
in
the
skies
i
believe
she
knows
now
the
arm
about
jan
shoulder
tightened
and
cummins
head
dropped
until
his
rough
cheek
rested
upon
the
boy
hair
there
was
something
of
the
gentleness
of
love
in
what
he
did
and
in
response
to
it
jan
caught
the
hand
that
was
hanging
over
his
shoulder
in
both
his
own
boy
wo
you
tell
me
who
you
are
and
why
you
came
that
night
i
will
tell
you
now
that
i
come
from
ze
great
bear
whispered
i
am
only
jan
thoreau
an
ze
great
god
made
me
come
that
night
because
his
heart
throbbed
with
sudden
inspiration
as
he
looked
up
into
his
companion
face
because
ze
leetle
mélisse
was
here
he
finished
for
a
time
cummins
made
no
move
or
sound
then
he
drew
the
boy
back
into
the
cabin
and
from
the
little
box
in
the
corner
he
took
a
buckskin
bag
you
are
going
to
churchill
for
mélisse
and
for
her
he
said
in
a
voice
pitched
low
that
it
might
not
awaken
the
baby
take
this
jan
drew
a
step
back
no
i
fin
work
with
ze
at
churchill
that
is
ze
gold
for
mélisse
when
she
grow
up
jan
thoreau
is
no
what
you
call
heem
his
teeth
gleamed
in
a
smile
but
it
lasted
only
for
an
instant
cummins
face
darkened
and
he
caught
him
firmly
almost
roughly
by
the
arm
then
jan
thoreau
will
never
come
back
to
mélisse
he
exclaimed
with
finality
you
are
going
to
churchill
to
be
at
school
and
not
to
work
with
your
hands
they
are
sending
you
do
you
understand
boy
they
there
was
a
fierce
tremor
in
his
voice
which
will
it
be
will
you
take
the
bag
or
will
you
never
again
come
back
to
lac
bain
dumbly
jan
reached
out
and
took
the
buckskin
pouch
a
dull
flush
burned
in
his
cheeks
cummins
looked
in
wonder
upon
the
strange
look
that
came
into
his
eyes
i
pay
back
this
gold
to
you
and
mélisse
a
hundred
times
he
cried
tensely
i
swear
it
an
i
swear
that
jan
thoreau
mak
no
lie
unconsciously
with
the
buckskin
bag
clutched
in
one
hand
he
had
stretched
out
his
other
arm
to
the
violin
hanging
against
the
wall
cummins
turned
to
look
when
he
faced
him
again
the
boy
arm
had
fallen
to
his
side
and
his
cheeks
were
white
the
next
day
he
left
no
one
heard
his
last
words
to
mélisse
or
witnessed
his
final
of
her
for
cummins
sympathized
with
the
boy
grief
and
went
out
of
the
cabin
an
hour
before
mukee
was
ready
with
his
pack
the
last
that
he
heard
was
jan
violin
playing
low
sweet
music
to
the
child
three
weeks
later
when
mukee
returned
to
lac
bain
he
said
that
jan
had
traveled
to
churchill
like
one
who
had
lost
his
tongue
and
that
far
into
the
nights
he
had
played
lonely
dirges
upon
his
violin
chapter
xii
a
rumor
from
the
south
it
was
a
long
winter
for
cummins
and
mélisse
it
was
a
longer
one
for
jan
he
had
taken
with
him
a
letter
from
the
factor
at
lac
bain
to
the
factor
at
churchill
and
he
found
quarters
with
the
chief
assistant
at
the
post
a
young
man
who
had
come
over
on
the
ship
from
england
he
was
a
cheerful
young
fellow
and
when
he
learned
that
his
new
associate
had
tramped
all
the
way
from
the
barren
lands
to
attend
the
new
public
school
he
at
once
invested
himself
with
the
responsibilities
of
a
private
tutor
he
taught
jan
first
of
all
to
say
is
in
place
of
ees
it
was
a
tremendous
lesson
for
jan
but
he
struggled
with
it
manfully
and
a
week
after
his
arrival
when
one
evening
he
was
tuning
his
violin
to
play
for
young
macdonald
he
said
with
eager
gravity
ah
i
have
it
now
macdonald
it
ees
not
it
ees
macdonald
roared
but
persisted
and
in
time
jan
began
to
get
the
twist
out
of
his
tongue
the
school
opened
in
november
and
jan
found
himself
one
of
twenty
or
so
gathered
there
from
forty
thousand
square
miles
of
wilderness
two
white
youths
and
a
had
come
from
the
etawney
the
factor
at
nelson
house
sent
up
his
son
and
from
the
upper
waters
of
the
little
churchill
there
came
three
others
from
the
first
jan
music
found
him
a
premier
place
in
the
interest
of
the
tutor
sent
over
by
the
company
he
studied
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
and
by
the
end
of
the
second
month
his
only
competitor
was
the
youth
from
nelson
house
his
greatest
source
of
knowledge
was
not
the
teacher
but
macdonald
there
was
in
him
no
inherent
desire
for
the
learning
of
the
people
to
the
south
that
he
was
storing
away
like
a
faithful
machine
for
the
use
of
mélisse
but
macdonald
gave
him
that
for
which
his
soul
longed
a
picture
of
life
as
it
existed
in
the
wonderful
world
beyond
the
wilderness
to
which
some
strange
spirit
within
him
growing
stronger
as
the
weeks
and
months
passed
seemed
projecting
his
hopes
and
his
ambitions
between
his
thoughts
of
mélisse
and
lac
bain
he
dreamed
of
that
other
world
and
several
times
during
the
winter
he
took
the
little
roll
from
the
box
of
his
violin
and
read
again
and
again
the
written
pages
that
it
contained
some
time
i
will
go
he
assured
himself
always
some
time
when
mélisse
is
a
little
older
and
can
go
too
to
young
macdonald
the
boy
from
lac
bain
was
a
find
the
scottish
youth
was
filled
with
an
immense
longing
for
home
and
as
his
homesickness
grew
he
poured
more
and
more
into
jan
attentive
ears
his
knowledge
of
the
world
from
which
he
had
come
he
told
him
the
history
of
the
old
brass
cannon
that
lay
abandoned
among
the
vines
and
bushes
where
a
fort
had
stood
at
churchill
many
years
before
he
described
the
coming
of
the
first
ship
into
the
great
bay
told
of
hudson
and
his
men
of
great
wars
that
his
listener
had
never
dreamed
of
of
kings
and
queens
and
strange
nations
at
night
he
read
a
great
deal
to
jan
out
of
books
that
he
had
brought
over
with
him
as
the
weeks
and
months
passed
the
strange
spirit
that
was
calling
to
the
forest
boy
out
of
that
other
world
stirred
more
restlessly
within
him
at
times
it
urged
him
to
confide
in
macdonald
what
was
hidden
away
in
the
box
of
his
violin
the
secret
nearly
burst
from
him
one
sunday
when
macdonald
said
i
going
home
on
the
ship
that
comes
over
next
summer
what
do
you
say
to
going
back
with
me
jan
the
spirit
surged
through
jan
in
a
hot
flood
and
it
was
only
an
accident
that
kept
him
from
saying
what
was
in
his
heart
they
were
standing
with
the
icy
bay
stretching
off
in
interminable
miles
toward
the
pole
a
little
way
from
them
the
restless
tide
was
beating
up
through
the
broken
ice
and
eating
deeper
into
the
frozen
shore
from
out
of
the
bank
there
projected
here
and
there
the
ends
of
dark
objects
which
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
company
had
been
in
them
were
the
bones
of
men
who
had
lived
and
died
an
age
ago
and
as
jan
looked
at
the
silent
coffins
now
falling
into
the
sea
another
spirit
the
spirit
that
bound
him
to
mélisse
entered
into
him
and
he
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
what
might
happen
in
the
passing
of
a
year
it
was
this
spirit
that
won
in
the
spring
jan
went
back
to
lac
bain
with
the
company
supplies
the
next
autumn
he
followed
the
school
to
york
factory
and
the
third
year
he
joined
it
at
nelson
house
then
the
company
teacher
died
and
no
one
came
to
fill
his
place
in
midwinter
of
this
third
year
jan
returned
to
lac
bain
and
hugging
the
delighted
mélisse
close
in
his
arms
he
told
her
that
never
again
would
he
go
away
without
her
mélisse
tightening
her
arms
around
his
neck
made
his
promise
sacred
by
offering
her
little
rosebud
of
a
mouth
for
him
to
kiss
later
the
restless
spirit
slumbering
within
his
breast
urged
him
to
speak
to
cummins
when
mélisse
is
a
little
older
should
we
not
go
with
her
into
the
south
he
said
she
must
not
live
for
ever
in
a
place
like
this
cummins
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
as
if
he
did
not
understand
when
jan
meaning
struck
home
his
eyes
hardened
and
there
was
the
vibrant
ring
of
steel
in
his
quiet
voice
her
mother
will
be
out
there
under
the
old
spruce
until
the
end
of
time
he
said
slowly
and
we
will
never
leave
her
unless
some
day
mélisse
goes
alone
from
that
hour
jan
no
longer
looked
into
the
box
of
his
violin
he
struggled
against
the
desire
that
had
grown
with
his
years
until
he
believed
that
he
had
crushed
it
and
stamped
it
out
of
his
existence
in
his
life
there
came
to
be
but
one
rising
and
one
setting
of
the
sun
mélisse
was
his
universe
she
crowded
his
heart
until
beyond
her
he
began
to
lose
visions
of
any
other
world
each
day
added
to
his
joy
he
called
her
my
little
sister
and
with
sweet
gravity
mélisse
called
him
brother
jan
and
returned
in
full
measure
his
boundless
love
he
marked
the
slow
turning
of
her
flaxen
hair
into
sunny
gold
and
month
by
month
watched
joyfully
the
deepening
of
that
gold
into
warm
shades
of
brown
she
was
to
be
like
her
mother
jan
soul
rejoiced
and
in
his
silent
way
cummins
offered
up
wordless
prayers
of
thankfulness
so
matters
stood
at
post
lac
bain
in
the
beginning
of
mélisse
ninth
year
when
up
from
the
south
there
came
a
rumor
as
civil
war
spreads
its
deepest
gloom
as
the
struggle
of
father
against
son
and
brother
against
brother
stifles
the
breathing
of
nations
so
this
rumor
set
creeping
a
deep
pall
over
the
forest
people
rumor
grew
into
rumor
from
the
east
the
south
and
the
west
they
multiplied
until
on
all
sides
the
paul
reveres
of
the
wilderness
carried
news
that
the
red
terror
was
at
their
heels
and
the
chill
of
a
great
fear
swept
like
a
shivering
wind
from
the
edge
of
civilization
to
the
bay
chapter
xiii
the
red
terror
nineteen
years
before
these
same
rumors
had
come
up
from
the
south
and
the
red
terror
had
followed
the
horror
of
it
still
remained
with
the
forest
people
for
a
thousand
unmarked
graves
shunned
like
a
pestilence
and
scattered
from
the
lower
waters
of
james
bay
to
the
lake
country
of
the
athabasca
gave
evidence
of
the
toll
it
demanded
from
dubrochet
on
reindeer
lake
authentic
word
first
came
to
lac
bain
early
in
the
winter
henderson
was
factor
there
and
he
passed
up
the
warning
that
had
come
to
him
from
nelson
house
and
the
country
to
the
southeast
there
smallpox
on
the
nelson
his
messenger
informed
williams
and
it
has
struck
the
crees
on
wollaston
lake
god
only
knows
what
it
is
doing
to
the
bay
indians
but
we
hear
that
it
is
wiping
out
the
chippewayans
between
the
albany
and
the
churchill
he
left
the
same
day
with
his
winded
dogs
i
off
for
the
révillon
people
to
the
west
with
the
compliments
of
our
company
he
explained
three
days
later
word
came
from
churchill
that
all
of
the
servants
and
her
majesty
subjects
west
of
the
bay
should
prepare
themselves
for
the
coming
of
the
red
terror
williams
thick
face
went
as
white
as
the
paper
he
held
as
he
read
the
words
of
the
churchill
factor
it
means
dig
graves
he
said
that
the
only
preparation
we
can
make
he
read
the
paper
aloud
to
the
men
at
lac
bain
and
every
available
man
was
detailed
to
spread
the
warning
throughout
the
post
territory
there
was
a
quick
harnessing
of
dogs
and
on
each
sledge
that
went
out
was
a
roll
of
red
cotton
cloth
williams
face
was
still
white
as
he
passed
these
rolls
out
from
the
company
store
they
were
ominous
of
death
lurid
signals
of
pestilence
and
horror
and
the
touch
of
them
sent
shuddering
chills
through
the
men
who
were
about
to
scatter
them
among
the
forest
people
jan
went
over
the
churchill
trail
and
then
swung
southward
along
the
hasabala
where
the
country
was
crisscrossed
with
of
the
and
the
french
first
he
struck
the
cabin
of
croisset
and
his
wife
and
left
part
of
his
cloth
then
he
turned
westward
while
croisset
harnessed
his
dogs
and
hurried
with
a
quarter
of
the
roll
to
the
south
between
the
hasabala
and
klokol
lake
jan
found
three
other
cabins
and
at
each
he
left
a
bit
of
the
red
cotton
forty
miles
to
the
south
somewhere
on
the
porcupine
were
the
lines
of
henry
langlois
the
post
greatest
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
jan
set
off
in
search
of
langlois
and
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
he
came
upon
a
trail
on
this
he
camped
until
morning
when
dawn
came
he
began
following
it
he
passed
half
a
dozen
of
langlois
in
none
of
them
was
there
bait
in
three
the
traps
were
sprung
in
the
seventh
he
found
the
remains
of
a
red
fox
that
had
been
eaten
until
there
was
little
but
the
bones
left
two
houses
beyond
there
was
an
ermine
in
a
trap
with
its
head
eaten
off
with
growing
perplexity
jan
examined
the
trails
in
the
snow
the
most
recent
of
them
were
days
old
he
urged
on
his
dogs
stopping
no
more
at
the
until
with
a
shrieking
command
he
brought
them
to
a
halt
at
the
edge
of
a
clearing
cut
in
the
forest
a
dozen
rods
ahead
of
him
was
the
trapper
cabin
over
it
hanging
limply
to
a
sapling
pole
was
the
red
signal
of
horror
with
a
terrified
cry
to
the
dogs
jan
ran
back
and
the
team
turned
about
and
followed
him
in
a
tangled
mass
then
he
stopped
there
was
no
smoke
rising
from
the
clay
chimney
on
the
little
cabin
its
one
window
was
white
with
frost
again
and
again
he
shouted
but
no
sign
of
life
responded
to
his
cries
he
fired
his
rifle
twice
and
waited
with
his
mittened
hand
over
his
mouth
and
nostrils
there
was
no
reply
then
abandoning
hope
he
turned
back
into
the
north
and
gave
his
dogs
no
rest
until
he
had
reached
lac
bain
his
team
came
in
half
dead
both
cummins
and
williams
rushed
out
to
meet
him
as
he
drove
up
before
the
company
store
the
red
flag
is
over
langlois
cabin
he
cried
i
fired
my
rifle
and
shouted
there
is
no
life
langlois
is
dead
great
god
groaned
williams
his
red
face
changed
to
a
sickly
pallor
and
he
stood
with
his
thick
hands
clenched
while
cummins
took
charge
of
the
dogs
and
jan
went
into
the
store
for
something
to
eat
mukee
and
returned
to
the
post
the
next
day
young
williams
followed
close
after
them
filled
with
terror
he
had
found
the
plague
among
the
crees
of
the
waterfound
each
day
added
to
the
gloom
at
lac
bain
for
a
time
jan
could
not
fully
understand
and
he
still
played
his
violin
and
romped
joyfully
with
mélisse
in
the
little
cabin
he
had
not
lived
through
the
plague
of
nineteen
years
before
most
of
the
others
had
even
to
mukee
the
youngest
of
them
all
jan
did
not
know
that
it
was
this
red
terror
that
came
like
a
nemesis
of
the
gods
to
cut
down
the
people
of
the
great
northland
until
they
were
fewer
in
number
than
those
of
the
sahara
desert
but
he
learned
quickly
in
february
the
crees
along
wollaston
lake
were
practically
wiped
out
red
flags
marked
the
trail
of
the
nelson
death
leaped
from
cabin
to
cabin
in
the
wilderness
to
the
west
by
the
middle
of
the
month
lac
bain
was
hemmed
in
by
the
plague
on
all
sides
but
the
north
the
post
had
been
shortened
now
they
were
abandoned
entirely
and
the
great
fight
began
williams
assembled
his
men
and
told
them
how
that
same
battle
had
been
fought
nearly
two
decades
before
for
sixty
miles
about
the
post
every
cabin
and
wigwam
that
floated
a
red
flag
must
be
visited
and
burned
if
the
occupants
were
dead
in
learning
whether
life
or
death
existed
in
these
places
lay
the
peril
for
those
who
undertook
the
task
it
was
a
dangerous
mission
it
meant
facing
a
death
from
which
those
who
listened
to
the
old
factor
shrank
with
dread
yet
when
the
call
came
they
responded
to
a
man
cummins
and
jan
ate
their
last
supper
together
with
mélisse
sitting
between
them
and
wondering
at
their
silence
when
it
was
over
the
two
went
outside
mukee
was
at
the
store
said
cummins
in
a
thick
strained
voice
halting
jan
in
the
gloom
behind
the
cabin
williams
thought
he
was
off
to
the
south
with
his
dogs
but
he
is
i
saw
him
drag
himself
into
his
shack
like
a
sick
dog
an
hour
before
dusk
there
be
a
red
flag
over
lac
bain
in
the
morning
jan
stifled
the
sharp
cry
on
his
lips
ah
there
a
light
cried
cummins
it
a
pitch
torch
burning
in
front
of
his
door
a
shrill
quavering
cry
came
from
the
direction
of
mukee
cabin
and
the
two
recognized
it
as
the
voice
of
the
father
a
wordless
cry
rising
and
dying
away
again
and
again
like
the
wailing
of
a
dog
sudden
lights
flashed
into
the
night
as
they
had
flashed
years
ago
when
cummins
staggered
forth
from
his
home
with
word
of
the
woman
death
he
gripped
jan
arm
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
horror
the
flag
is
up
now
he
whispered
huskily
go
back
to
mélisse
there
is
food
in
the
house
for
a
month
and
you
can
bring
the
wood
in
bar
the
door
open
only
the
back
window
for
air
stay
inside
with
her
until
it
is
all
over
go
to
the
red
flags
that
is
where
i
will
go
cried
jan
fiercely
wrenching
his
arm
free
it
is
your
place
to
stay
with
mélisse
my
place
is
with
the
men
and
mine
jan
drew
himself
up
rigid
one
of
us
must
shut
himself
up
with
her
pleaded
cummins
it
must
be
you
his
face
gleamed
white
in
the
darkness
you
came
that
night
because
mélisse
was
here
something
sent
you
something
you
understand
and
since
then
she
has
never
been
near
to
death
until
now
you
must
stay
with
mélisse
with
your
violin
mélisse
herself
shall
choose
replied
we
will
go
into
the
cabin
and
the
one
to
whom
she
comes
first
goes
among
the
red
flags
the
other
shuts
himself
in
the
cabin
until
the
plague
is
gone
he
turned
swiftly
back
to
the
door
as
he
opened
it
he
stepped
aside
to
let
cummins
enter
first
and
behind
the
other
broad
back
he
leaped
quickly
to
one
side
his
eyes
glowing
his
white
teeth
gleaming
in
a
smile
unseen
by
cummins
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
mélisse
who
was
playing
with
the
strings
of
his
violin
on
the
table
he
had
done
this
a
thousand
times
and
mélisse
knew
what
it
meant
a
kiss
and
a
joyous
toss
halfway
to
the
ceiling
she
jumped
from
her
stool
and
ran
to
him
but
this
time
instead
of
hoisting
her
above
his
head
he
hugged
her
up
close
to
his
breast
and
buried
his
face
in
her
soft
hair
his
eyes
looked
over
her
in
triumph
to
cummins
up
jan
up
up
cried
mélisse
he
tossed
her
until
she
half
turned
in
midair
kissed
her
again
as
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
set
her
laughing
and
happy
on
the
edge
of
the
table
i
am
going
down
among
the
sick
crees
in
cummins
place
said
jan
to
williams
half
an
hour
later
now
that
the
plague
has
come
to
lac
bain
he
must
stay
with
mélisse
chapter
xiv
a
long
waiting
the
next
morning
jan
struck
out
over
his
old
trail
to
the
hasabala
the
crees
were
gone
he
spent
a
day
swinging
east
and
west
and
found
old
trails
leading
into

that
the
leading
dog
dropped
upon
his
haunches
with

menacing
growl

a
lone
figure
staggered
across
the
snow
toward
them
it
was

a
groan

up
in
a
bloody
rag

pointed
to
his
neck
from
which
the
skin
was
peeling
i
was
gone
ten
days
with
that
red
cloth
you
gave
me
and
when
i
came
back

was
the
horror

grinning
at
me
from
the
top
of
my
own
shanty
i
tried
to
get
in
but
my
wife
barred
the
door
and
said
that
she
would
shoot
me
if
i
did
get
back
into
the
woods
i
tried
to
steal
in
at
night
through
a
window
and
she
drenched
me
in
hot
water
i
built
a
wigwam
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
stayed
there
for
five
days
blessed

had
no

no
grub
and
when
i
got
close
enough
to
yell
these
things
to
her
she
kept
her
word
and
plunked
me
through
a
crack
in
the
door
so
that
i
lost
a
pint
of
blood
from
this
arm

jan
thoreau
though
i
do
believe
she
meant
to
hit
me
it
was
a
woman
bad
aim
jan
left
him
beside
a
good
fire
and
turned
into
the
southwest
to
burn
langlois
and
his
cabin
the
red
flag
still
floated
where
he
had
seen
it
weeks
before
the
windows
were
thicker
with
frost
he
shouted
beat
upon
the
door
with
the
butt
of
his
rifle
and
broke
in
the
windows
the
silence
of
death
quickened
the
beating
of
his
heart
when
he
stopped
to
listen
there
was
no
doubt
that
langlois
lay
dead
in
his
little
home
jan
brought
dry
brushwood
from
the
forest
and
piled
it
high
against
the
logs
upon
his
sledge
he
sat
and
watched
the
fire
until
the
cabin
was
a
furnace
of
leaping
flame
he
continued
westward
at
the
head
of
the
porcupine
he
found
the
remains
of
three
burned
wigwams
and
from
one
of
them
he
dug
out
charred
bones
down
the
porcupine
he
went
slowly
doubling
to
the
east
and
west
until
at
its
junction
with
gray
otter
creek
he
met
a
cree
who
told
him
that
twenty
miles
farther
on
there
was
an
abandoned
village
of
six
teepees
toward
these
he
boldly
set
forth
praying
as
he
went
that
the
angels
were
guarding
mélisse
at
post
lac
bain
croisset
reached
the
post
hours
after
he
had
encountered
the
red
flag
is
everywhere
he
cried
catching
sight
of
the
signal
over
mukee
cabin
it
is
to
the
east
and
west
of
the
hasabala
as
thick
as
jays
in
springtime
the
cree
from
the
gray
otter
drove
in
on
his
way
north
six
wigwams
with
dead
in
them
he
reported
in
his
own
language
to
williams
a
company
man
with
a
leader
and
four
trailers
left
the
gray
otter
to
burn
them
williams
took
down
his
and
bellowed
a
weird
signal
to
cummins
who
opened
a
crack
of
his
door
to
listen
with
mélisse
close
beside
him
thoreau
is
in
the
thick
of
it
to
the
south
he
called
there
too
much
of
it
for
him
and
i
going
down
with
the
dogs
croisset
will
stay
in
the
store
for
a
few
days
mélisse
heard
the
words
and
her
eyes
were
big
with
fear
when
her
father
turned
from
closing
and
bolting
the
door
in
more
than
a
childish
way
she
knew
that
jan
had
gone
forth
to
face
a
great
danger
the
grim
laws
of
the
savage
world
in
which
she
lived
had
already
begun
to
fix
their
influence
upon
her
quickening
her
instinct
and
reason
just
as
they
hastened
the
lives
of
indian
children
into
the
responsibilities
of
men
and
women
before
they
had
reached
fifteen
she
knew
what
the
red
flag
over
mukee
cabin
meant
she
knew
that
the
air
of
this
world
of
hers
had
become
filled
with
peril
to
those
who
breathed
it
and
that
people
were
dying
out
in
the
forests
that
all
about
them
there
was
a
terrible
unseen
thing
which
her
father
called
the
plague
and
that
jan
had
gone
forth
to
fight
it
to
breathe
it
and
perhaps
to
die
in
it
their
own
door
was
locked
and
bolted
against
it
she
dared
not
even
thrust
her
head
from
the
window
which
was
opened
for
a
short
time
each
day
and
until
cummins
assured
her
that
there
was
no
danger
in
the
sunshine
she
shunned
the
few
pale
rays
that
shot
through
the
at
midday
unconsciously
cummins
added
to
her
fears
in
more
ways
than
one
and
as
he
answered
her
questions
truthfully
her
knowledge
increased
day
by
day
she
thought
more
and
more
of
she
watched
for
him
through
the
two
windows
of
her
home
every
sound
from
outside
brought
her
to
them
with
eager
hope
and
always
her
heart
sank
with
disappointment
and
the
tears
would
come
very
near
to
her
eyes
when
she
saw
nothing
but
the
terrible
red
flag
clinging
to
the
pole
over
mukee
cabin
in
the
little
bible
which
her
mother
had
left
there
was
written
on
the
ragged
a
simple
prayer
each
night
as
she
knelt
beside
her
cot
and
repeated
this
prayer
she
paused
at
the
end
and
added
dear
father
in
heaven
please
take
care
of
jan
the
days
brought
quick
changes
now
one
morning
the
called
cummins
to
the
door
it
was
the
fifth
day
after
williams
had
gone
south
there
was
no
smoke
this
morning
and
i
looked
through
the
window
shouted
croisset
mukee
and
the
old
man
are
both
dead
i
going
to
burn
the
cabin
a
stifled
groan
of
anguish
fell
from
cummins
lips
as
he
went
like
a
dazed
man
to
his
cot
and
flung
himself
face
downward
upon
it
mélisse
could
see
his
strong
frame
shaking
as
if
he
were
crying
like
a
child
and
twining
her
arms
tightly
about
his
neck
she
sobbed
out
her
passionate
grief
against
his
rough
cheek
she
did
not
know
the
part
that
mukee
had
played
in
the
life
of
the
sweet
woman
who
had
once
lived
in
this
same
little
cabin
she
knew
only
that
he
was
dead
that
the
terrible
thing
had
killed
him
and
that
next
to
her
father
and
jan
she
had
loved
him
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
soon
she
heard
a
strange
sound
and
ran
to
the
window
mukee
cabin
was
in
flames
and
tearless
with
horror
she
watched
the
fire
as
it
burst
through
the
broken
windows
and
leaped
high
up
among
the
black
spruce
in
those
flames
was
mukee
she
screamed
and
her
father
sprang
to
her
with
a
strange
cry
running
with
her
from
the
window
into
the
little
room
where
she
slept
the
next
morning
when
cummins
went
to
awaken
her
his
face
went
as
white
as
death
mélisse
was
not
asleep
her
eyes
were
wide
open
and
staring
at
him
and
her
soft
cheeks
burned
with
the
hot
glow
of
fire
you
are
sick
mélisse
he
whispered
hoarsely
you
are
sick
he
fell
upon
his
knees
beside
her
and
lifted
her
face
in
his
hands
the
touch
of
it
sent
a
chill
to
his
heart
such
as
he
had
not
felt
since
many
years
ago
in
that
other
room
a
few
steps
away
i
want
jan
she
pleaded
i
want
jan
to
come
back
to
me
i
will
send
for
him
dear
he
will
come
back
soon
i
will
go
out
and
send
croisset
he
hid
his
face
from
her
as
he
dragged
himself
away
croisset
saw
him
coming
and
came
out
of
the
store
to
meet
him
a
hundred
yards
away
cummins
stopped
croisset
for
the
love
of
god
take
a
team
and
go
after
jan
thoreau
he
called
tell
him
that
mélisse
is
dying
of
the
plague
hurry
hurry
night
and
day
shouted
croisset
twenty
minutes
later
from
the
cabin
window
cummins
saw
him
start
jan
will
be
here
very
soon
mélisse
he
said
running
his
fingers
gently
through
her
hair
it
fell
out
upon
the
pillow
in
thick
brown
waves
and
the
sight
of
it
choked
him
with
the
memory
of
another
vision
which
would
remain
with
him
until
the
end
of
time
it
was
her
mother
hair
shining
softly
in
the
dim
light
her
mother
eyes
looked
up
at
him
as
he
sat
beside
her
through
all
this
long
day
toward
evening
there
came
a
change
the
fever
left
the
child
cheeks
her
eyes
closed
and
she
fell
asleep
through
the
night
cummins
sat
near
the
door
but
in
the
gray
dawn
overcome
by
his
long
vigil
his
head
dropped
upon
his
breast
and
he
slumbered
when
he
awoke
the
cabin
was
filled
with
light
he
heard
a
sound
and
startled
sprang
to
his
feet
mélisse
was
at
the
stove
building
a
fire
i
better
this
morning
father
why
did
you
sleep
until
breakfast
was
ready
cummins
stared
then
he
gave
a
shout
made
a
rush
for
her
and
catching
her
up
in
his
arms
danced
about
the
cabin
like
a
great
bear
overturning
the
chairs
and
allowing
the
room
to
fill
with
smoke
in
his
wild
joy
it
what
you
saw
through
the
window
that
made
you
sick
mélisse
he
cried
putting
her
down
at
last
i
thought
he
paused
and
added
his
voice
trembling
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
sick
for
more
than
one
day
my
sweet
little
woman
he
opened
one
of
the
windows
to
let
in
the
fresh
air
of
the
morning
when
croisset
returned
he
did
not
find
a
red
flag
over
cummins
cabin
nor
did
he
bring
word
of
for
three
days
he
had
followed
the
trails
to
the
south
without
finding
the
boy
but
he
brought
back
other
news
williams
was
sick
with
the
plague
in
a
cree
wigwam
on
the
lower
porcupine
it
was
the
last
they
ever
heard
of
the
factor
except
that
he
died
some
time
in
march
and
was
burned
by
the
crees
croisset
went
back
over
the
churchill
trail
and
found
his
wife
ready
to
greet
him
with
open
arms
after
that
he
joined
who
came
in
from
the
north
in
another
search
for
jan
they
found
neither
trace
nor
word
of
him
after
passing
the
gray
otter
and
cummins
gave
up
hope
it
was
not
for
long
that
their
fears
could
be
kept
from
mélisse
this
first
bitter
grief
that
had
come
into
her
life
fell
upon
her
with
a
force
which
alarmed
cummins
and
cast
him
into
deep
gloom
she
no
longer
loved
to
play
with
her
things
in
the
cabin
for
days
at
a
time
she
would
not
touch
the
books
which
jan
had
brought
from
churchill
and
which
he
had
taught
her
to
read
she
found
little
to
interest
her
in
the
things
which
had
been
her
life
a
few
weeks
before
with
growing
despair
cummins
saw
his
own
efforts
fail
as
the
days
passed
mélisse
mingled
more
and
more
with
the
indian
and
children
and
spent
much
of
her
time
at
the
company
store
listening
to
the
talk
of
the
men
silent
attentive
unresponsive
to
any
efforts
they
might
make
to
engage
her
smiles
from
her
own
heart
she
looked
out
upon
a
world
that
had
become
a
void
for
her
jan
had
been
mother
brother
and
everything
that
was
tender
and
sweet
to
her
and
he
was
gone
mukee
whom
she
had
loved
was
gone
williams
was
gone
the
world
was
changed
terribly
and
suddenly
and
it
added
years
to
her
perspective
of
things
each
day
as
the
weeks
went
on
and
the
spring
sun
began
to
soften
the
snow
she
became
a
little
more
like
the
wild
children
at
lac
bain
and
in
the
forest
for
jan
she
had
kept
her
hair
soft
and
bright
because
he
praised
her
for
it
and
told
her
it
was
pretty
now
it
hung
in
tangles
down
her
back
there
came
a
night
when
she
forgot
her
prayer
and
cummins
did
not
notice
it
he
failed
to
notice
it
the
next
night
and
the
next
plunged
deep
in
his
own
gloom
he
was
unobservant
of
many
other
things
so
that
in
place
of
laughter
and
joy
and
merry
rompings
only
gloomy
and
oppressive
shadows
of
things
that
had
come
and
gone
filled
the
life
of
the
little
cabin
they
were
eating
dinner
one
day
in
the
early
spring
with
the
sunshine
flooding
in
upon
them
when
a
quick
low
footfall
caused
mélisse
to
lift
her
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
open
door
a
strange
figure
stood
there
with
bloodless
face
staring
eyes
and
garments
hanging
in
tatters
but
its
arms
were
stretched
out
as
those
same
arms
had
been
held
out
to
her
a
thousand
times
before
and
with
the
old
glad
cry
mélisse
darted
with
the
swiftness
of
a
beyond
cummins
crying
jan
jan
my
jan
words
choked
in
cummins
throat
when
he
saw
the
figure
clutching
mélisse
to
its
breast
at
last
he
gasped
jan
and
threw
out
his
arms
so
that
both
were
caught
in
their
embrace
for
an
instant
jan
turned
his
face
up
to
the
light
the
other
stared
and
understood
you
have
been
sick
he
said
but
it
has
left
no
marks
thank
god
breathed
mélisse
raised
her
head
and
stroked
his
cheeks
with
her
two
hands
that
night
she
remembered
her
prayer
and
at
its
end
she
added
dear
father
in
heaven
thank
you
for
sending
back
jan
chapter
xv
almost
a
woman
peace
followed
in
the
blighted
trails
of
the
red
terror
again
the
forest
world
breathed
without
fear
but
from
hudson
bay
to
athabasca
and
as
far
south
as
the
thousand
waters
of
the
reindeer
country
the
winds
whispered
of
a
terrible
grief
that
would
remain
until
babes
were
men
and
men
went
to
their
graves
life
had
been
torn
and
broken
in
a
cataclysm
more
fearful
than
that
which
levels
cities
and
disrupts
the
earth
slowly
it
began
its
readjustment
there
was
no
other
life
to
give
aid
or
sympathy
and
just
as
they
had
suffered
alone
so
now
the
forest
people
struggled
back
into
life
alone
building
up
from
the
wreck
of
what
had
been
the
things
that
were
to
be
for
months
the
crees
wailed
their
death
dirges
as
they
sought
out
the
bones
of
their
dead
men
dragged
themselves
into
the
posts
wifeless
and
childless
leaving
deep
in
the
wilderness
all
that
they
had
known
to
love
and
give
them
comfort
now
and
then
came
a
woman
and
around
the
black
scars
of
burned
cabins
and
teepees
dogs
howled
mournfully
for
masters
that
were
gone
the
plague
had
taken
a
thousand
souls
and
yet
the
laughing
dancing
millions
in
that
other
big
world
beyond
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
caught
only
a
passing
rumor
of
what
had
happened
lac
bain
suffered
least
of
the
far
northern
posts
with
the
exception
of
churchill
where
the
icy
winds
from
the
arctic
had
sent
the
red
terror
shivering
to
the
westward
in
the
late
snows
word
came
that
cummins
was
to
take
williams
place
as
factor
and
at
once
set
off
for
the
fond
du
lac
to
bring
back
jean
de
gravois
as
chief
man
croisset
gave
up
his
to
fill
mukee
place
the
changes
brought
new
happiness
to
mélisse
croisset
wife
was
a
good
woman
who
had
spent
her
girlhood
in
montreal
and
iowaka
now
the
mother
of
a
little
jean
and
a
handsome
daughter
was
a
young
venus
who
had
grown
sweeter
and
prettier
with
her
years
which
is
not
usually
the
case
with
women
but
it
good
blood
in
her
beautiful
blood
vaunted
jean
proudly
whenever
the
opportunity
came
her
mother
was
a
princess
and
her
father
a
pure
frenchman
whose
father
father
was
a
chef
de
bataillon
what
better
than
that
eh
i
say
what
better
could
there
be
than
that
so
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
mélisse
discovered
the
joys
of
companionship
with
those
of
her
own
kind
this
new
companionship
pleasant
as
it
was
did
not
come
between
her
and
jan
if
anything
they
were
more
to
each
other
than
ever
the
terrible
months
through
which
they
had
passed
had
changed
them
both
and
had
given
them
according
to
their
years
the
fruits
which
are
often
ripened
in
the
black
gloom
of
disaster
rather
than
in
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
to
mélisse
they
had
opened
up
a
new
world
of
thought
a
new
vision
of
the
things
that
existed
about
her
the
sternest
teacher
of
all
had
brought
to
her
the
knowledge
that
comes
of
grief
of
terror
and
of
death
and
she
had
passed
beyond
her
years
just
as
the
cumulative
processes
of
generations
made
the
indian
children
pass
beyond
theirs
she
no
longer
looked
upon
jan
as
a
mere
playmate
a
being
whose
diversion
was
to
amuse
and
to
love
her
he
had
become
a
man
in
her
eyes
he
was
a
hero
who
had
gone
forth
to
fight
the
death
of
which
she
still
heard
word
and
whisper
all
about
her
croisset
wife
and
iowaka
told
her
that
he
had
done
the
bravest
thing
that
a
man
might
do
on
earth
she
spoke
proudly
of
him
to
the
indian
children
who
called
him
the
she
noticed
that
he
was
as
tall
as
croisset
and
taller
by
half
a
head
than
jean
and
that
he
lifted
her
now
with
one
arm
as
easily
as
if
she
were
no
heavier
than
a
stick
of
wood
together
they
resumed
their
studies
devoting
hours
to
them
each
day
and
through
all
that
summer
he
taught
her
to
play
upon
his
violin
the
warm
months
were
a
time
of
idleness
at
lac
bain
and
jan
made
the
most
of
them
in
his
teaching
of
mélisse
she
learned
to
read
the
books
which
he
had
used
at
fort
churchill
and
by
midsummer
she
could
read
those
which
he
had
used
at
york
factory
at
night
they
wrote
letters
to
each
other
and
delivered
them
across
the
table
in
the
cabin
while
cummins
looked
on
and
smoked
laughing
happily
at
what
they
read
aloud
to
him
one
night
late
enough
in
the
season
for
a
fire
to
be
crackling
merrily
in
the
stove
jan
was
reading
one
of
these
letters
when
mélisse
cried
stop
jan
stop
there
jan
caught
himself
and
he
blushed
mightily
when
he
read
the
next
lines
think
you
have
beautiful
eyes
i
love
them
what
is
it
cried
cummins
interestedly
read
on
do
commanded
mélisse
springing
to
her
feet
and
running
around
the
table
i
did
mean
you
to
read
that
she
snatched
the
paper
from
jan
hand
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
jan
blood
filled
with
pleasure
and
at
the
bottom
of
his
next
letter
he
wrote
back
i
think
you
have
beautiful
hair
i
love
it
that
winter
jan
was
appointed
post
hunter
and
this
gave
him
much
time
at
home
for
meat
was
plentiful
along
the
edge
of
the
barrens
the
two
continued
at
their
books
until
they
came
to
the
end
of
what
jan
knew
in
them
after
that
like
searchers
in
strange
places
they
felt
their
way
onward
slowly
and
with
caution
during
the
next
summer
they
labored
through
all
the
books
which
were
in
the
little
box
in
the
corner
of
the
cabin
it
was
mélisse
who
now
played
most
on
the
violin
and
jan
listened
his
eyes
glowing
proudly
as
he
saw
how
cleverly
her
little
fingers
danced
over
the
strings
his
face
flushed
with
a
joy
that
was
growing
stronger
in
him
every
day
one
day
she
looked
curiously
into
the
of
the
instrument
and
her
pretty
mouth
puckered
itself
into
a
round
red
o
of
astonishment
when
jan
quickly
snatched
the
violin
from
her
hands
ma
belle
mélisse
he
laughed
at
her
in
french
i
am
going
to
play
you
something
new
that
same
day
he
took
the
little
roll
from
the
violin
and
gave
it
another
it
recalled
to
him
the
strange
spirit
which
had
once
moved
him
at
fort
churchill
and
which
had
remained
with
him
for
a
time
at
lac
bain
that
spirit
was
now
gone
luring
him
no
longer
time
had
drawn
a
softening
veil
over
things
that
had
passed
he
was
happy
the
wilderness
became
more
beautiful
to
him
as
mélisse
grew
older
each
summer
increased
his
happiness
each
succeeding
winter
made
it
larger
and
more
complete
every
fiber
of
his
being
sang
in
joyful
response
as
he
watched
mélisse
pass
from
childhood
into
young
girlhood
he
marked
every
turn
in
her
development
the
slightest
change
in
her
transformation
as
if
she
had
been
a
beautiful
flower
he
possessed
none
of
the
quick
impetuosity
of
jean
de
gravois
years
gave
the
silence
of
the
north
to
his
tongue
and
his
exultation
was
quiet
and
deep
in
his
own
heart
with
an
eagerness
which
no
one
guessed
he
watched
the
growing
beauty
of
her
hair
marked
its
brightening
luster
when
he
saw
it
falling
in
thick
waves
over
her
shoulders
and
he
knew
that
at
last
it
had
come
to
be
like
the
woman
the
changing
lights
in
her
eyes
fascinated
him
and
he
rejoiced
again
when
he
saw
that
they
were
deepening
into
the
violet
blue
of
the
bakneesh
flowers
that
bloomed
on
the
tops
of
the
ridges
to
him
mélisse
was
growing
into
everything
that
was
beautiful
she
was
his
world
his
life
and
at
post
lac
bain
there
was
nothing
to
come
between
the
two
jan
noticed
that
in
her
thirteenth
year
she
could
barely
stand
under
his
outstretched
arm
the
next
year
she
had
grown
so
tall
that
she
could
not
stand
there
at
all
very
soon
she
would
be
a
woman
the
thought
leaped
from
his
heart
and
he
spoke
it
aloud
it
was
on
the
girl
fifteenth
birthday
they
had
come
up
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
on
which
he
had
fought
the
missionary
to
gather
red
sprigs
of
the
bakneesh
for
the
festival
that
they
were
to
have
in
the
cabin
that
night
high
up
on
the
face
of
a
jagged
rock
jan
saw
a
bit
of
the
crimson
vine
thrusting
itself
out
into
the
sun
and
with
mélisse
laughing
and
encouraging
him
from
below
he
climbed
up
until
he
had
secured
it
he
tossed
it
down
to
her
it
the
last
one
she
cried
seeing
his
disadvantage
and
i
going
home
you
ca
catch
me
she
darted
away
swiftly
along
the
ridge
taunting
him
with
merry
laughter
as
she
left
him
clambering
in
cautious
descent
down
the
rock
jan
followed
in
pursuit
shouting
to
her
in
french
in
cree
and
in
english
and
their
two
voices
echoed
happily
in
their
wild
frolic
jan
slackened
his
steps
it
was
a
joy
to
see
mélisse
springing
from
rock
to
rock
and
darting
across
the
thin
openings
close
ahead
of
him
her
hair
loosening
and
sweeping
out
in
the
sun
her
slender
figure
fleeing
with
the
lightness
of
the
pale
that
ran
up
and
down
the
mountain
he
would
not
have
overtaken
her
of
his
own
choosing
but
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
mélisse
gave
up
she
returned
toward
him
panting
and
laughing
shimmering
like
a
under
the
glistening
veil
of
her
disheveled
hair
her
face
glowed
with
excitement
her
eyes
filled
with
the
light
of
the
sun
dazzled
jan
in
their
laughing
defiance
before
her
he
stopped
and
made
no
effort
to
catch
her
never
had
he
seen
her
so
beautiful
still
daring
him
with
her
laugh
quivering
and
panting
flinging
back
her
hair
half
reaching
out
his
arms
he
cried
mélisse
you
are
beautiful
you
are
almost
a
woman
the
flush
deepened
in
her
cheeks
and
there
was
no
longer
the
sweet
taunting
mischief
in
her
eyes
she
made
no
effort
to
run
from
him
when
he
came
to
her
do
you
think
so
brother
jan
if
you
did
your
hair
up
like
the
pictures
we
have
in
the
books
you
would
be
a
woman
he
answered
softly
you
are
more
beautiful
than
the
pictures
he
drew
a
step
back
and
her
eyes
flashed
at
him
again
with
the
sparkle
of
the
old
fun
in
them
you
say
that
i
am
pretty
and
that
i
am
almost
a
woman
she
pouted
and
yet
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
at
him
in
mock
disdain
jan
thoreau
this
is
the
third
time
in
the
last
week
that
you
have
not
played
the
game
right
i
wo
play
with
you
any
more
in
a
flash
he
was
at
her
side
her
face
between
his
two
hands
and
bending
down
he
kissed
her
upon
the
mouth
there
she
said
as
he
released
her
is
that
the
way
we
have
played
it
ever
since
i
can
remember
whenever
you
catch
me
you
may
have
that
i
am
afraid
mélisse
he
said
seriously
you
are
growing
so
tall
and
so
pretty
that
i
am
afraid
afraid
my
brother
afraid
to
kiss
me
and
what
will
you
do
when
i
get
to
be
a
woman
jan
which
will
be
very
soon
you
say
i
do
know
mélisse
she
turned
her
back
to
him
and
flung
out
her
hair
and
jan
who
had
done
this
same
thing
for
her
a
hundred
times
before
divided
the
silken
mass
into
three
strands
and
plaited
them
into
a
braid
i
do
believe
that
you
care
for
me
as
much
as
you
used
to
jan
i
wish
i
were
a
woman
so
that
i
might
know
if
you
are
going
to
forget
me
entirely
her
shoulders
trembled
and
when
he
had
finished
his
task
he
found
that
she
was
laughing
and
that
her
eyes
were
swimming
with
a
new
mischief
which
she
was
trying
to
hide
from
him
in
that
laugh
there
was
something
which
was
not
like
mélisse
slight
as
the
change
was
he
noticed
it
but
instead
of
displeasing
him
it
set
a
vague
sensation
of
pleasure
trilling
like
a
new
song
within
him
when
they
reached
the
post
mélisse
went
to
the
cabin
with
her
bakneesh
and
jan
to
the
company
store
tossing
the
vines
upon
the
table
mélisse
ran
back
to
the
door
and
watched
him
until
he
disappeared
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
lips
half
parted
in
excitement
and
no
sooner
had
he
gone
from
view
than
she
hurried
to
iowaka
home
across
the
clearing
it
was
fully
three
quarters
of
an
hour
later
when
jan
saw
mélisse
with
iowaka
red
shawl
over
her
head
walking
slowly
and
with
extreme
precision
of
step
back
to
the
cabin
i
wonder
if
she
has
the
earache
he
said
to
himself
watching
her
curiously
that
is
iowaka
shawl
and
she
has
it
all
about
her
head
a
clear
of
the
rarest
wool
from
london
added
the
cheery
voice
of
jean
de
gravois
whose
moccasins
had
made
no
sound
behind
him
he
always
spoke
in
french
to
there
is
but
one
person
in
the
world
who
looks
better
in
it
than
your
mélisse
jan
thoreau

jean
who
not
having
his
caribou
whip
jumped
up
and
down
to
emphasize
his
words

a
woman

hour
ago
for

of
sunshine

but

minute
the
happy
jean
hopped
out
like
a
cricket
with
life
calling
loudly
to
his
wife
who
came
to
meet
him
a
few
minutes
later
jan
thrust
his
head
in
at
their
door
as
he
was
passing
i
knew
i
should
get

beating

in
her
sweet
cree
that

to
find

for
himself
so
so
it
is
exclaimed
the
irrepressible
jean
plunging
himself
to
the
elbows
in
his
pan
of
dough
then
hurry
to
the
cabin
jan
and
see
what
sort
of
a
birthday
gift
mélisse
has
got
for
you
chapter
xvi
birthdays
the
big
room
was
empty
when
jan
came
quietly
through
the
open
door
he
stopped
to
listen
and
caught
a
faint
laugh
from
the
other
room
and
then
another
and
to
give
warning
of
his
presence
he
coughed
loudly
and
scraped
a
chair
along
the
floor
a
moment
silence
followed
the
farther
door
opened
a
little
and
then
it
opened
wide
and
mélisse
came
out
now
what
do
you
think
of
me
brother
jan
she
stood
in
the
light
of
the
window
through
which
came
the
afternoon
sun
her
hair
piled
in
glistening
coils
upon
the
crown
of
her
head
as
they
had
seen
them
in
the
pictures
her
cheeks
flushed
her
eyes
glowing
questioningly
at
do
i
look
as
you
thought
i
would
jan
she
persisted
a
little
doubtful
at
his
silence
she
turned
so
that
he
saw
the
cluster
of
soft
curls
that
fell
upon
her
shoulder
with
sprigs
of
bakneesh
half
smothered
in
them
do
i
you
are
prettier
than
i
have
ever
seen
you
mélisse
he
replied
softly
there
was
a
seriousness
in
his
voice
that
made
her
come
to
him
in
her
old
impulsive
way
she
lifted
her
hands
and
rested
them
on
his
shoulders
as
she
had
always
done
when
inviting
him
to
toss
her
above
his
head
if
i
am
prettier
and
you
like
me
this
way
why
do
you
she
finished
with
a
sweet
upturned
pouting
of
her
mouth
and
with
a
sudden
laughing
cry
jan
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
the
lips
she
held
up
to
him
it
was
but
an
instant
and
he
freed
her
a
hot
blush
burning
in
his
brown
cheeks
my
dear
brother
she
laughed
at
him
gathering
up
the
bakneesh
on
the
table
i
love
to
have
you
kiss
me
and
now
i
have
to
make
you
do
it
father
kisses
me
every
morning
when
he
goes
to
the
store
i
remember
when
you
used
to
kiss
me
every
time
you
came
home
but
now
you
forget
to
do
it
at
all
do
brothers
love
their
sisters
less
as
they
grow
older
sometimes
they
love
the
sister
less
and
the
other
girl
more
ma
belle
mélisse
came
a
quick
voice
from
the
door
and
jean
de
gravois
bounded
in
like
a
playful
cat
scraping
and
bowing
before
mélisse
until
his
head
nearly
touched
the
floor
lovely
saints
jan
thoreau
but
she
is
a
woman
just
as
my
iowaka
told
me
and
the
cakes
the
bread
the
pies
you
must
delay
the
supper
my
lady
for
the
good
lord
deliver
me
if
i
have
spilled
all
the
dough
on
the
floor
such
a
mess
and
my
iowaka
did
nothing
but
laugh
and
call
me
a
clumsy
dear
you
terribly
in
love
jean
cried
mélisse
laughing
until
her
eyes
were
wet
just
like
some
of
the
people
in
the
books
which
jan
and
i
read
and
i
always
shall
be
my
dear
so
long
as
the
daughter
of
a
princess
and
the
of
a
chef
de
bataillon
allows
me
to
mix
her
dough
mélisse
flung
the
red
shawl
over
her
head
still
laughing
i
will
go
and
help
her
jean
mon
dieu
gasped
gravois
looking
searchingly
at
jan
when
she
had
left
shall
i
give
you
my
best
wishes
jan
thoreau
does
it
signify
signify
what
the
little
frenchman
eyes
snapped
why
when
our
pretty
cree
maiden
becomes
engaged
she
puts
up
her
hair
for
the
first
time
that
is
all
my
dear
jan
when
i
asked
my
blessed
iowaka
to
be
my
wife
she
answered
by
running
away
from
me
taunting
me
until
i
thought
my
heart
had
shriveled
into
a
bit
of
salt
blubber
but
she
came
back
to
me
before
i
had
completely
died
with
her
braids
done
up
on
the
top
of
her
head
he
stopped
suddenly
startled
into
silence
by
the
strange
look
that
had
come
into
the
other
face
for
a
full
minute
jan
stood
as
if
the
power
of
movement
had
gone
from
him
he
was
staring
over
the
head
a
ghastly
pallor
growing
in
his
cheeks
no
it
means
nothing
he
said
finally
speaking
as
if
the
words
were
forced
from
him
one
by
one
he
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
like
one
whose
senses
had
been
dulled
by
an
unexpected
blow
with
a
great
sighing
breath
that
was
almost
a
sob
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
arms
jan
thoreau
whispered
jean
softly
have
you
forgotten
that
it
was
i
who
killed
the
missioner
for
you
and
that
through
all
of
these
years
jean
de
gravois
has
never
questioned
you
about
the
fight
on
the
mountain
top
there
was
in
his
voice
as
gentle
as
a
woman
the
vibrant
note
of
a
comradeship
which
is
next
to
love
the
comradeship
of
man
for
man
in
a
world
where
friendship
is
neither
bought
nor
sold
have
you
forgotten
jan
thoreau
if
there
is
anything
jean
de
gravois
can
do
he
sat
down
opposite
jan
his
thin
eager
face
propped
in
his
hands
and
watched
silently
until
the
other
lifted
his
head
their
eyes
met
steady
unflinching
and
in
that
look
there
were
the
oath
and
the
seal
of
all
that
the
honor
of
the
big
snows
held
for
those
two
still
without
words
jan
reached
within
his
breast
and
drew
forth
the
little
roll
which
he
had
taken
from
his
violin
one
by
one
he
handed
the
pages
over
to
jean
de
gravois
mon
dieu
said
jean
when
he
had
finished
reading
he
spoke
no
other
words
the
two
men
stared
jan
throat
twitching
gravois
brown
fingers
crushing
the
rolls
he
held
that
was
why
i
tried
to
kill
the
missioner
said
jan
at
last
he
pointed
to
the
more
coarsely
written
pages
under
jean
hand
and
that
that
is
why
it
could
not
signify
that
mélisse
has
done
up
her
hair
he
rose
to
his
feet
straining
to
keep
his
voice
even
and
gathered
up
the
papers
so
that
they
shot
back
into
the
little
roll
again
now
do
you
understand
i
understand
replied
jean
in
a
low
voice
but
his
eyes
glittered
like
dancing
as
he
raised
his
elbows
slowly
from
the
table
and
stretched
his
arms
above
his
head
i
understand
jan
thoreau
and
i
praise
the
blessed
virgin
that
it
was
jean
de
gravois
who
killed
the
missioner
out
upon
the
ice
of
lac
bain
but
the
other
persisted
jan
the
other
which
says
that
i
stop
cried
jean
sharply
he
came
around
the
table
and
seized
hands
in
the
iron
grip
of
his
lithe
brown
fingers
that
is
something
for
you
to
forget
it
means
nothing
nothing
at
all
jan
thoreau
does
any
one
know
but
you
and
me
no
one
i
intended
that
some
day
mélisse
and
her
father
should
know
but
i
waited
too
long
i
waited
until
i
was
afraid
until
the
horror
of
telling
her
frightened
me
i
made
myself
forget
burying
it
deeper
each
year
until
on
the
mountain
and
in
this
cabin
you
will
forget
again
and
you
will
bury
it
so
deep
that
it
will
never
come
back
i
am
proud
of
you
jan
thoreau
i
love
you
and
it
is
the
first
time
that
jean
de
gravois
has
ever
said
this
to
a
man
ah
i
hear
them
coming
with
an
absurd
bow
in
the
direction
of
the
laughing
voices
which
they
now
heard
the
melodramatic
little
frenchman
pulled
jan
to
the
door
across
the
open
were
mélisse
and
iowaka
carrying
a
large
indian
basket
between
them
and
making
merry
over
the
task
when
they
saw
gravois
and
jan
they
set
down
their
burden
and
waved
an
invitation
for
the
two
men
to
come
to
their
assistance
you
should
be
the
second
happiest
man
in
the
world
jan
thoreau
exclaimed
jean
the
first
is
jean
de
gravois
he
set
off
like
a
bolt
from
a
in
the
direction
of
the
two
who
were
waiting
for
them
he
had
hoisted
the
basket
upon
his
shoulder
by
the
time
jan
arrived
are
you
growing
old
too
jan
bantered
mélisse
as
she
dropped
a
few
steps
behind
jean
and
his
wife
you
come
so
slowly
i
think
i
you
think
her
dancing
eyes
shot
up
to
his
bubbling
over
with
the
mischief
which
she
had
been
unable
to
suppress
that
day
why
jan
he
had
never
spoken
to
mélisse
as
he
did
now
i
was
born
some
time
in
the
winter
mélisse
like
you
perhaps
it
was
yesterday
perhaps
it
is
that
is
all
i
know
he
looked
at
her
steadily
the
grief
which
he
was
fighting
to
keep
back
tightening
the
muscles
about
his
mouth
like
the
quick
passing
of
sunshine
the
fun
swept
from
her
face
leaving
her
blue
eyes
staring
up
at
him
filled
with
a
pain
which
he
had
never
seen
in
them
before
in
a
moment
he
knew
that
she
had
understood
him
and
he
could
have
cut
out
his
tongue
her
hand
reached
his
arm
and
she
stopped
him
her
face
lifted
pleadingly
the
tears
slowly
gathering
in
her
eyes
forgive
me
she
whispered
her
voice
breaking
into
a
sob
dear
dear
jan
forgive
me
she
caught
one
of
his
hands
in
both
her
own
and
for
an
instant
held
it
so
that
he
could
feel
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
is
your
birthday

yours
and
mine

and
yours
and
we
will
always
have
it
that
way

chapter

the
renunciation
jan
was
glad
when
the
evening
came
and
was
gone
not
until
jean
and
iowaka
had
said
good
night
with
croisset
and
his
wife
and
both
cummins
and
mélisse
had
gone
to
their
rooms
did
he
find
himself
relieved
of
the
tension
under
which
he
had
struggled
during
all
of
that
in
the
cabin
from
the
first
he
knew
that
his
nerves
were
strung
by
some
strange
and
indefinable
sensation
that
was
growing
within
him
something
which
he
could
hardly
have
explained
at
first
but
which
swiftly
took
form
and
meaning
and
oppressed
him
more
as
the
hours
flew
by
almost
fiercely
he
strove
to
fight
back
the
signs
of
it
from
his
face
and
voice
never
had
he
played
as
on
this
night
his
violin
leaped
with
life
his
voice
rose
high
in
the
wild
forest
songs
of
jean
de
gravois
and
croisset
he
sprang
aloft
in
the
caribou
dance
until
the
tips
of
his
fingers
touched
the
log
beams
overhead
and
yet
there
was
none
of
the
flush
of
excitement
in
his
face
no
joyous
fire
flashing
from
his
eyes
upon
mélisse
she
saw
this
and
wondered
a
dozen
times
her
eyes
encountered
his
straight
and
questioning
when
the
others
were
not
looking
she
saw
in
response
only
a
dull
lusterless
glow
that
was
not
like
the
jan
who
had
pursued
her
that
day
on
the
jan
was
unaware
of
what
was
lacking
in
him
he
smiled
when
she
gave
him
these
glances
deep
down
in
him
his
heart
trembled
at
the
beauty
of
her
flushed
cheeks
the
luster
of
her
coiled
hair
the
swimming
depths
of
her
clear
eyes
but
the
mask
of
the
thing
at
which
she
wondered
still
remained
after
the
others
had
gone
cummins
sat
up
to
smoke
a
pipe
when
he
had
finished
he
went
to
his
room
jan
was
now
sleeping
in
a
room
at
the
company
store
and
after
a
time
he
rose
silently
to
take
down
his
cap
and
coat
he
opened
the
outer
door
quietly
so
as
not
to
arouse
mélisse
who
had
gone
to
bed
half
an
hour
before
as
he
was
about
to
go
out
there
came
a
sound
a
low
gentle
whispered
word
jan
he
turned
mélisse
stood
in
her
door
she
had
not
undressed
and
her
hair
was
still
done
up
in
its
soft
coils
with
the
crimson
bakneesh
shining
in
it
she
came
to
him
hesitatingly
until
she
stood
with
her
two
hands
upon
his
arm
gazing
into
his
tense
face
with
that
same
question
in
her
eyes
jan
you
were
not
pleased
with
me
she
whispered
tell
me
why
i
was
pleased
with
you
mélisse
he
replied
he
took
one
of
the
hands
that
was
clinging
to
his
arm
and
turned
his
face
to
the
open
night
countless
stars
gleamed
in
the
sky
as
they
had
shone
on
another
night
fifteen
years
ago
from
where
they
stood
they
saw
the
pale
flicker
of
the
aurora
sending
its
shivering
arrows
out
over
the
dome
of
the
earth
with
the
same
lonely
song
that
it
had
played
when
the
woman
died
gaunt
and
solitary
the
tall
spruce
loomed
up
against
the
silver
glow
its
thick
head
sighing
faintly
in
the
night
wind
as
if
in
wailing
answer
to
that
music
in
the
skies
suddenly
there
leaped
up
from
jan
thoreau
breast
a
breath
that
burst
from
his
lips
in
a
low
cry
mélisse
mélisse
it
was
just
fifteen
years
ago
that
i
came
in
through
that
forest
out
there
starved
and
dying
and
played
my
violin
when
your
mother
died
you
were
a
little
baby
then
and
since
that
night
you
have
never
pleased
me
more
than
now
he
dropped
her
hand
and
turned
squarely
to
the
door
to
hide
what
he
knew
had
come
into
his
face
he
heard
a
soft
little
sob
behind
him
and
something
fell
rustling
upon
his
arm
jan
dear
jan
mélisse
crowded
herself
into
his
arms
her
hair
torn
down
and
tumbling
about
her
shoulders
in
her
eyes
there
were
the
old
pride
and
the
old
love
the
love
and
pride
of
what
seemed
to
jan
to
be
years
ago
the
old
childish
pleading
for
his
comradeship
for
the
fun
of
his
strong
arms
the
frolic
of
his
laugh
irresistibly
they
called
to
him
and
in
the
old
glad
way
he
tightened
his
arms
about
her
shoulders
his
eyes
glowing
and
life
leaping
back
flushed
and
full
into
his
face
she
laughed
happy
and
trembling
her
lips
held
up
to
him
i
did
please
you
she
whispered
i
will
never
do
up
my
hair
again
he
kissed
her
and
his
arms
dropped
from
her
shoulders
never
never
again
until
you
have
forgotten
to
love
me
she
repeated
good
night
brother
jan
across
the
open
through
the
thinned
edge
of
the
black
spruce
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
cold
unquivering
lifelessness
of
the
forest
jan
went
from
the
door
that
closed
between
him
and
mélisse
her
last
words
still
whispering
in
his
ears
the
warm
touch
of
her
hair
on
his
cheeks
and
the
knowledge
of
what
this
day
had
meant
for
him
swiftly
surging
upon
him
bringing
with
it
a
torment
which
racked
him
to
the
soul
fifteen
years
ago
he
stopped
and
looked
up
the
starlight
whitening
his
face
there
was
no
change
in
this
night
from
that
other
one
of
ages
and
ages
ago
there
were
the
same
stars
like
fierce
eyes
of
pale
fire
robbed
of
softness
by
the
polar
cold
there
were
the
same
cloudless
blue
space
the
same
hissing
flashes
of
the
aurora
leaping
through
its
infinity
the
same
trees
that
had
listened
to
his
moaning
prayers
on
that
night
when
he
had
staggered
into
lac
bain
he
went
on
until
he
came
to
where
the
beaten
trail
swept
up
and
away
from
a
swamp
as
vividly
as
if
it
had
happened
but
yesterday
he
remembered
how
he
had
dragged
himself
through
this
swamp
bleeding
and
starving
his
violin
clutched
to
his
breast
guided
by
the
barking
of
dogs
which
seemed
to
come
from
a
million
miles
away
he
plunged
into
it
now
picking
his
tangled
way
until
he
stood
upon
a
giant
ridge
from
which
he
looked
out
through
the
white
night
into
the
limitless
barrens
to
the
north
along
the
edge
of
those
barrens
he
had
come
daring
the
hundred
deaths
between
hunter
cabin
and
indian
wigwam
starving
at
times
almost
dying
of
cold
building
fires
to
keep
the
wolves
back
and
playing
always
playing
to
keep
up
his
courage
until
he
found
mélisse
fifteen
years
had
passed
since
then
and
the
cumulative
force
of
the
things
that
had
grown
out
of
those
years
had
fallen
upon
him
this
day
he
had
felt
it
first
when
mélisse
turned
upon
him
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
after
that
in
the
cabin
in
every
breath
he
drew
in
every
look
that
he
gave
her
for
him
she
had
changed
for
all
time
she
was
no
longer
the
little
mélisse
his
sister
and
yet
he
was
almost
saying
her
last
words
aloud
good
night
brother
jan
she
had
come
to
him
that
day
to
let
him
kiss
her
as
she
had
come
to
him
a
thousand
times
before
but
he
had
not
kissed
her
in
the
old
way
it
was
a
different
love
that
his
lips
had
given
and
even
now
the
hot
blood
surged
again
into
his
face
as
he
thought
of
what
he
had
done
his
was
a
different
idea
of
honor
from
that
held
by
men
born
to
the
ways
of
passion
in
that
which
had
stirred
his
blood
thrilling
him
with
strange
joy
as
he
held
her
in
his
arms
he
saw
more
than
the
shadow
of
sin
sacrilege
against
a
thing
which
was
more
precious
to
him
than
life
mélisse
came
to
him
still
as
his
sister
abiding
in
her
glorious
faith
in
him
unaware
of
his
temptation
while
he
jan
thoreau
he
thrust
a
hand
inside
his
coat
and
clutched
at
the
papers
that
jean
de
gravois
had
read
then
he
drew
them
forth
slowly
and
held
them
crumpled
in
his
fingers
while
for
many
minutes
he
stared
straight
out
into
the
gray
gloom
of
the
treeless
plain
his
eyes
shifted
searchingly
they
traveled
up
the
face
of
the
crags
behind
him
they
hunted
where
the
starlight
made
deep
pits
of
gloom
in
the
twisting
edge
of
the
mountains
they
went
from
rock
to
rock
and
from
tree
to
tree
until
at
last
they
rested
upon
a
giant
spruce
which
hung
out
over
the
precipitous
wall
of
the
ridge
its
thick
top
beckoning
and
sighing
to
the
black
rocks
that
shot
up
out
of
the
snow
five
hundred
feet
below
it
was
a
strange
tree
weird
and
black
free
of
stub
or
bough
for
a
hundred
feet
and
from
far
out
on
the
barrens
those
who
traveled
their
solitary
ways
east
and
west
knew
that
it
was
a
monument
shaped
by
men
mukee
had
told
jan
its
story
in
the
first
autumn
of
the
woman
life
at
lac
bain
he
and
had
climbed
the
old
spruce
lopping
off
its
branches
until
only
the
black
cap
remained
and
after
that
it
was
known
far
and
wide
as
the
lobstick
of
cummins
wife
it
was
a
voiceless
cenotaph
which
signified
that
all
the
honor
and
love
known
to
the
wilderness
people
had
been
given
to
her
to
it
went
jan
the
papers
still
held
in
his
hand
he
had
seen
a
pair
of
storing
food
in
the
butt
of
the
tree
two
or
three
summers
before
and
now
his
fingers
groped
for
the
hole
when
he
found
it
he
thrust
in
the
papers
crowded
them
down
and
filled
the
hole
with
chunks
of
bark
always
my
sister
and
never
anything
more
to
jan
thoreau
he
said
gently
in
french
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
a
spirit
in
the
old
tree
that
is
the
honor
of
these
snows
it
is
what
the
great
god
means
us
to
be
the
strife
had
gone
from
his
voice
it
rose
strong
and
clear
as
he
stretched
his
arms
high
up
along
the
shorn
side
of
the
spruce
his
eyes
upon
the
silent
plume
that
heard
his
oath
i
swear
that
jan
thoreau
will
never
do
wrong
to
the
little
mélisse
with
a
face
white
and
set
in
its
determination
he
turned
slowly
away
from
the
tree
far
away
from
the
lonely
depths
of
the
swamp
there
came
the
wailing
howl
of
a
wolf
a
cry
of
hungerful
savageness
that
died
away
in
echoes
of
infinite
sadness
it
was
like
the
howling
of
a
dog
at
the
door
of
a
cabin
in
which
his
master
lay
dead
and
the
sound
of
it
swept
a
flood
of
loneliness
into
jan
heart
it
was
the
of
his
own
last
hope
which
had
gone
out
of
him
for
ever
that
night
he
listened
and
it
came
again
but
in
the
middle
of
it
when
the
long
moaning
grief
of
the
voice
was
rising
to
its
full
despair
there
broke
in
a
sharp
interruption
a
shrieking
yelping
cry
such
as
a
dog
makes
when
it
is
suddenly
struck
in
another
moment
the
forest
thrilled
with
the
of
the
wolf
who
has
started
a
fresh
kill
hardly
had
its
echoes
died
away
when
from
deeper
in
the
swamp
there
came
another
cry
and
still
another
from
the
mountain
and
up
and
out
of
the
desolation
rose
the
calls
of
others
of
the
scattered
pack
in
quick
response
to
the
comrade
who
had
first
found
meat
all
the
cries
were
alike
filled
with
that
first
wailing
grief
except
that
of
the
swelling
throat
which
was
sending
forth
the
call
to
food
a
few
minutes
and
another
of
the
mournful
howls
changed
into
the
fierce
then
a
second
a
third
and
a
fourth
and
the
sound
of
the
chase
swept
swiftly
from
the
swamp
to
the
mountain
up
the
mountain
and
down
into
the
barrens
a
caribou
cried
jan
softly
a
caribou
and
he
is
going
into
the
barrens
there
is
no
water
and
he
is
lost
he
ran
and
leaned
over
beside
the
old
tree
so
that
the
great
plain
stretched
out
below
him
into
the
west
turned
the
pack
the
growing
fainter
until
it
almost
died
away
then
slowly
it
grew
again
in
volume
swinging
into
the
north
then
to
the
east
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
until
jan
saw
a
dark
swiftly
moving
blot
in
the
white
gloom
the
caribou
passed
by
within
half
a
of
him
another
half
behind
followed
the
wolves
flung
out
their
gray
bodies
moving
like
specters
in
a
cordon
and
their
leaders
almost
abreast
the
caribou
a
dozen
rods
to
each
side
there
was
no
sound
now
below
him
jan
could
see
the
pale
glimmer
of
ice
and
snow
where
in
summer
there
was
a
small
lake
desperately
the
caribou
made
an
effort
to
reach
this
lake
the
wolves
drew
in
the
of
their
bodies
shrunk
until
it
was
nearer
a
circle
from
the
plain
side
the
leading
wolf
closed
until
he
was
running
at
the
caribou
forelegs
the
mountain
wolf
responded
on
the
opposite
side
then
came
the
end
quick
decisive
and
without
sound
after
a
few
moments
there
came
faintly
the
snapping
of
jaws
and
the
crunching
of
bones
torn
and
bleeding
and
yet
quivering
with
life
the
caribou
was
given
up
to
the
feast
jan
turned
away
from
the
scene
torn
and
bleeding
at
his
own
heart
he
went
back
to
lac

chapter

brother
jan
when
he
came
into
the
cabin
for
breakfast
that
morning
jan
face
showed
signs
of
the
struggle
through
which
he
had
gone
cummins
had
already
finished
and
he
found
mélisse
alone
her
hair
was
brushed
back
in
its
old
smooth
way
and
when
she
heard
him
she
flung
her
long
braid
over
her
shoulder
so
that
it
fell
down
in
front
of
her
he
saw
the
movement
and
smiled
his
thanks
without
speaking
you
do
look
well
jan
she
said
anxiously
you
are
pale
and
your
eyes
are
bloodshot
i
am
not
feeling
right
he
admitted
trying
to
appear
cheerful
but
this
coffee
will
make
a
new
man
of
me
you
make
the
best
coffee
in
the
world
mélisse
how
do
you
know
brother
she
asked
have
you
drunk
any
other
than
mine
since
years
ago
at
churchill
and
york
factory
only
iowaka
but
i
know
that
yours
is
best
from
what
i
remember
of
the
coffee
at
the
bay
it
was
a
long
time
ago
was
it
she
asked
gently
looking
at
him
across
the
table
i
dreamed
of
those
days
last
night
jan
though
i
do
remember
anything
about
your
going
to
churchill
i
must
have
been
too
young
but
i
remember
when
you
went
to
nelson
house
and
how
lonely
i
was
last
night
i
dreamed
that
we
both
went
and
that
we
stood
together
looking
out
over
the
bay
where
the
tides
are
washing
away
the
gun
case
coffins
i
saw
the
ship
that
you
described
to
me
too
and
thought
that
we
wanted
to
go
out
to
it
but
could
do
you
suppose
we
ever
go
to
churchill
together
jan
and
ride
on
a
wonderful
ship
like
that
it
may
be
mélisse
and
then
i
dreamed
that
you
were
gone
and
i
was
alone
and
some
one
else
came
to
me
whom
i
did
like
at
all
and
tried
to
make
me
go
to
the
ship
was
that
strange
she
laughed
softly
as
she
rose
to
give
him
another
cup
of
coffee
what
did
you
mean
jan
thoreau
by
running
away
from
me
like
that
to
get
even
with
you
for
running
away
from
me
on
the
mountain
he
replied
quickly
she
paused
the
cup
half
filled
and
jan
looking
up
caught
her
eyes
full
of
mock
astonishment
and
were
you
sorry
i
ran
away
from
you
despite
himself
his
pale
cheeks
flushed
do
you
think
i
was
he
replied
equivocally
i
do
know
she
answered
slowly
filling
his
cup
what
are
you
going
to
do
jan
drive
out
on
the
churchill
trail
ledoq
wants
supplies
and
he
too
busy
with
his
to
come
in
will
you
take
me
i
afraid
not
mélisse
it
a
run
and
a
heavy
load
very
well
i
get
ready
immediately
she
jumped
up
from
the
table
darting
fun
at
him
with
her
eyes
and
ran
to
her
room
it
too
far
mélisse
he
called
after
her
it
too
far
and
i
a
heavy
load
did
i
take
that
run
with
you
over
to
oh
dear
jan
have
you
seen
my
new
cap
it
out
here
hanging
on
the
wall
replied
jan
falling
into
her
humor
despite
himself
but
i
say
mélisse
are
the
dogs
ready
she
called
if
they
not
i
be
dressed
before
you
can
harness
them
they
be
here
within
fifteen
minutes
he
replied
surrendering
to
her
her
merry
face
laughing
triumph
at
him
through
the
partly
open
door
destroyed
the
last
vestige
of
his
opposition
and
he
left
her
with
something
of
his
old
cheeriness
of
manner
whistling
a
gay
forest
tune
as
he
hurried
toward
the
store
when
he
returned
with
the
team
mélisse
was
waiting
for
him
a
gray
thing
of
silvery
lynx
fur
with
her
cheeks
lips
and
eyes
aglow
her
trim
little
feet
clad
in
soft
caribou
boots
that
came
to
her
knees
and
with
a
bunch
of
the
brilliant
bakneesh
fastened
jauntily
in
her
cap
i
made
room
for
you
he
said
in
greeting
pointing
to
the
sledge
which
i
not
going
to
fill
for
five
miles
at
least
declared
mélisse
is
it
a
glorious
morning
jan
i
feel
as
if
i
can
run
from
here
to
ledoq
with
a
crack
of
his
whip
and
a
shout
jan
swung
the
dogs
across
the
open
with
mélisse
running
lightly
at
his
side
from
their
cabin
jean
and
iowaka
called
out
shrill
adieus
the
day
is
not
far
off
when
they
two
will
be
as
you
and
i
my
iowaka
said
jean
in
his
poetic
cree
i
wager
you
that
it
will
be
before
her
next
birthday
and
mélisse
was
saying
i
wonder
if
there
are
many
people
as
happy
as
jean
and
iowaka
she
caught
her
breath
and
jan
cracked
on
the
dogs
in
a
spurt
that
left
her
panting
a
full
dozen
rods
behind
him
with
a
wild
halloo
he
stopped
the
team
and
waited
that
unfair
jan
you
have
to
put
me
on
the
sledge
he
tucked
her
in
among
the
furs
and
the
dogs
strained
at
their
traces
with
jan
whip
curling
and
snapping
over
their
backs
until
they
were
leaping
swiftly
and
with
unbroken
rhythm
of
motion
over
the
smooth
trail
then
jan
gathered
in
his
whip
and
ran
close
to
the
leader
his
moccasined
feet
taking
the
short
quick
light
steps
of
the
trained
forest
runner
his
chest
thrown
a
little
out
his
eyes
upon
the
twisting
trail
ahead
it
was
a
glorious
ride
and
mélisse
eyes
danced
with
joy
her
blood
thrilled
to
the
tireless
effort
of
the
pack
of
magnificent
brutes
ahead
of
her
she
watched
the
muscular
play
of
their
backs
and
legs
the
eager
outreaching
of
their
wolfish
heads
and
their
jaws
and
from
them
she
looked
to
jan
there
was
no
effort
in
his
running
his
pale
cheeks
were
flushed
his
black
hair
swept
back
from
the
gray
of
his
cap
gleaming
in
the
sun
like
the
dogs
there
was
music
in
his
movement
there
was
the
beauty
of
strength
of
endurance
of
manhood
born
to
the
forests
her
eyes
shone
proudly
the
color
deepened
in
her
cheeks
as
she
looked
at
him
wondering
if
there
was
another
man
in
the
world
like
jan
thoreau
mile
after
mile
slipped
behind
and
not
until
they
reached
the
mountain
on
which
he
had
fought
the
missionary
did
jan
bring
his
dogs
to
a
walk
mélisse
jumped
from
the
sledge
and
ran
quickly
to
his
side
i
can
beat
you
to
the
top
now
she
cried
if
you
catch
me
there
was
the
old
witching
challenge
in
her
eyes
she
sped
up
the
side
of
the
ridge
panting
and
breathless
jan
pursued
with
the
dogs
her
advantage
was
too
great
for
him
to
overcome
this
time
and
she
stood
laughing
down
at
him
when
he
came
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
you
as
pretty
as
a
fairy
mélisse
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
shining
with
admiration
prettier
than
the
fairy
in
the
book
thank
you
brother
the
one
with
golden
hair
yes
all
of
them
i
ca
imagine
how
a
girl
would
look
with
golden
hair
can
you
jan
before
he
could
answer
she
added
mischievously
did
you
see
any
fairies
at
churchill
or
york
factory
none
that
could
compare
with
you
mélisse
thank
you
again
brother
mine
i
believe
you
do
still
love
me
a
little
more
than
ever
in
my
life
replied
jan
quickly
though
he
tried
to
hold
his
tongue
as
they
went
on
to
ledoq
he
found
that
the
joyousness
of
the
morning
was
giving
way
again
to
the
old
gloom
and
heartache
brother
jan
brother
jan
brother
jan
the
words
pounded
themselves
incessantly
in
his
brain
until
they
seemed
to
keep
time
with
his
steps
beside
the
sledge
they
drove
him
back
into
his
thoughts
of
the
preceding
night
and
he
felt
a
sense
of
relief
when
they
reached
the
trapper
ledoq
was
stripping
the
from
a
when
the
team
pulled
up
in
front
of
his
cabin
when
he
saw
the
daughter
of
the
factor
at
lac
bain
with
jan
he
jumped
briskly
to
his
feet
flung
his
cap
through
the
door
of
the
shack
and
began
bowing
and
scraping
to
her
with
all
his
might
it
was
well
known
in
the
province
of
lac
bain
that
many
years
before
jean
de
gravois
had
lost
a
little
brother
who
had
disappeared
one
day
in
the
woods
and
there
were
those
who
hinted
that
ledoq
was
that
brother
for
jean
and
he
were
as
like
as
two
peas
in
the
ready
use
of
their
tongues
and
were
of
the
same
build
and
the
same
briskness
mélisse
laughed
merrily
as
ledoq
continued
to
bow
before
her
rattling
away
in
a
delighted
torrent
of
french
ah
thes
ees
wan
compleeman
mélisse
he
finished
at
last
breaking
for
an
instant
into
english
he
straightened
like
a
spring
and
turned
to
did
you
meet
the
strange
team
we
met
no
team
ledoq
looked
puzzled
half
a
mile
away
the
top
of
a
ridge
was
visible
from
the
cabin
he
pointed
to
it
an
hour
ago
i
saw
it
going
westward
along
the
mountain
three
men
and
six
dogs
whom
have
you
out
from
lac
bain
no
one
replied
it
must
have
been
the
new
agent
from
churchill
we
expect
him
early
this
winter
shall
we
hurry
back
mélisse
and
see
if
he
has
brought
our
books
and
you
must
have
dinner
with
me
objected
ledoq
jan
caught
a
quick
signal
from
mélisse
not
ledoq
it
early
and
we
have
a
lunch
for
the
trail
what
do
you
say
mélisse
if
you
not
tired
tired
he
tossed
the
last
package
from
the
sledge
and
cracked
his
long
whip
over
the
dogs
backs
as
they
both
cried
out
their
farewell
to
the
little
frenchman
tired
he
repeated
running
close
beside
her
as
the
team
swung
lightly
back
into
the
trail
and
laughing
down
into
her
face
how
could
i
ever
get
tired
with
you
watching
me
run
mélisse
i
would
mind
if
you
did
just
a
little
jan
is
there
room
for
two
she
gave
a
coquettish
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
jan
leaped
upon
the
moving
sledge
kneeling
close
behind
her
always
always
i
have
to
ask
you
she
pouted
you
need
get
too
near
you
know
if
you
do
want
to
the
old
sweet
challenge
in
her
voice
was
irresistible
and
for
a
moment
jan
felt
himself
surrendering
to
it
he
leaned
forward
until
his
chin
was
buried
in
the
silken
lynx
fur
of
her
coat
and
for
a
single
breath
he
felt
the
soft
touch
of
her
cheek
against
his
own
then
he
gave
a
sudden
shout
to
the
dogs
so
loud
that
it
startled
her
and
his
whip
writhed
and
snapped
twenty
feet
above
their
heads
like
a
thing
filled
with
life
he
sprang
from
the
sledge
and
again
ran
with
the
team
urging
them
on
faster
and
faster
until
they
dropped
into
a
panting
walk
when
they
came
to
the
ridge
along
which
ledoq
two
hours
before
had
seen
the
strangers
hurrying
toward
lac
bain
stop
cried
mélisse
taking
this
first
opportunity
to
scramble
from
the
sledge
you
cruel
to
the
dogs
jan
look
at
their
jaws
see
them
pant
jan
thoreau
i
never
seen
you
drive
like
that
since
the
night
we
were
chased
in
from
the
barrens
by
the
wolves
and
did
you
ever
see
me
run
any
faster
he
struggled
dropping
exhausted
upon
the
sledge
i
remember
only
one
other
time
he
took
a
long
breath
flinging
back
his
arms
to
bring
greater
volume
of
air
into
his
lungs
was
that
the
night
we
heard
the
wolves
howling
behind
us
mélisse
asked
no
it
was
many
years
ago
when
i
heard
far
to
the
south
that
my
little
mélisse
was
dying
of
the
plague
mélisse
sat
down
upon
the
sledge
beside
him
without
speaking
and
nestled
one
of
her
hands
a
little
timidly
in
one
of
his
big
brown
palms
tell
me
about
it
that
was
all
i
ran
you
would
run
as
fast
for
me
now
would
you
he
looked
at
her
boldly
and
saw
that
there
was
not
half
of
the
brilliant
flush
in
her
cheeks
i
ran
for
you
just
now
and
you
did
like
it
he
replied
i
do
mean
that
she
looked
up
at
him
and
her
fingers
tightened
round
his
own
away
back
years
and
years
and
years
ago
jan
you
went
out
to
fight
the
plague
and
nearly
died
in
it
for
me
would
you
do
that
much
again
i
would
do
more
mélisse
she
looked
at
him
doubtfully
her
eyes
searching
him
as
if
in
quest
of
something
in
his
face
which
she
scarce
believed
in
his
words
slowly
he
rose
to
his
feet
lifting
her
with
him
and
when
he
had
done
this
he
took
her
face
between
his
two
hands
and
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
some
day
i
will
do
a
great
deal
more
for
you
than
that
mélisse
and
then
what
she
questioned
as
he
hesitated
then
you
will
know
whether
i
love
you
as
much
now
as
i
did
years
and
years
and
years
ago
he
finished
gently
repeating
her
words
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
held
mélisse
silent
as
he
turned
to
straighten
out
the
dogs
but
when
he
came
back
making
her
comfortable
on
the
sledge
she
whispered
i
wish
you
would
do
it
soon
brother
jan
chapter
xix
the
new
agent
and
his
son
they
did
not
lunch
on
the
trail
but
drove
into
the
post
in
time
for
dinner
jean
de
gravois
and
croisset
came
forth
from
the
store
to
meet
them
you
have
company
my
dear
cried
jean
to
mélisse
two
gentlemen
fresh
from
london
on
the
last
boat
and
one
of
them
younger
and
handsomer
than
your
own
jan
thoreau
they
are
waiting
for
you
in
the
cabin
where
mon
pere
is
getting
them
dinner
and
telling
them
how
beautifully
you
would
have
made
the
coffee
if
you
were
there
two
said
jan
as
mélisse
left
them
who
are
they
the
new
agent
timothy
dixon
as
red
as
the
plague
and
fatter
than
a
spawning
fish
and
his
son
who
has
come
along
for
fun
he
says
and
i
believe
he
will
get
what
he
after
if
he
remains
here
very
long
jan
thoreau
for
he
looked
a
little
too
boldly
at
my
iowaka
when
she
came
into
the
store
just
now
mon
dieu
laughed
jan
as
gravois
took
in
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
with
a
terrible
gesture
can
you
blame
him
jean
i
tell
you
that
i
look
at
iowaka
whenever
i
get
the
chance
is
she
not
worth
it
cried
jean
in
rapture
you
are
welcome
to
every
look
that
you
can
get
jan
thoreau
but
the
foreigner
i
will
skin
him
alive
and
spit
him
with
if
he
so
much
as
peeps
at
her
out
of
the
wrong
way
of
his
eye
croisset
spoke
there
was
once
a
foreigner
who
came
you
remember
i
remember
said
jan
he
looked
to
the
white
cross
which
marked
mukee
grave
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
the
shadow
of
the
big
spruce
fell
across
it
at
the
end
of
summer
evenings
and
he
died
said
jean
de
gravois
his
dark
hands
clenched
god
forgive
me
but
i
hate
these
men
from
across
the
sea
croisset
shrugged
his
shoulders
breeders
of
he
exclaimed
fiercely
la
charogne
there
are
two
at
nelson
house
and
two
on
the
wholdaia
and
one
a
sharp
cry
fell
from
jan
lips
when
croisset
whirled
toward
him
he
stood
among
his
dogs
as
white
as
death
his
black
eyes
blazing
as
if
just
beyond
him
he
saw
something
which
filled
him
with
terror
as
the
man
turned
startled
by
the
look
jean
sprang
to
his
side
saints
preserve
us
but
that
was
an
ugly
twist
of
the
hand
he
cried
shrilly
next
time
turn
your
sledge
by
the
rib
instead
of
the
nose
when
your
dogs
are
still
in
the
traces
under
his
breath
he
whispered
as
he
made
pretense
of
looking
at
jan
hand
le
diable
do
you
want
to
tell
him
jan
tried
to
laugh
as
croisset
came
to
see
what
had
happened
will
you
care
for
the
dogs
henri
asked
jean
it
only
a
trifling
sprain
of
the
wrist
which
iowaka
can
cure
with
one
dose
of
her
liniment
as
they
walked
away
jan
face
still
as
pallid
as
the
gray
snow
under
their
feet
gravois
added
you
a
fool
jan
thoreau
there
a
crowd
at
your
cabin
and
you
have
dinner
with
me
la
charogne
muttered
les
bêtes
de
charogne
jean
gripped
him
by
the
arm
i
tell
you
that
it
means
nothing
nothing
he
said
repeating
his
words
of
the
previous
day
in
the
cabin
you
are
a
man
you
must
fight
it
down
and
forget
no
one
knows
but
you
and
me
you
will
never
tell
what
you
read
in
the
papers
cried
jan
quickly
you
swear
it
by
the
blessed
virgin
i
swear
it
then
said
jan
softly
mélisse
will
never
know
never
said
jean
his
dark
face
flashed
joyously
as
iowaka
sweet
voice
came
to
them
singing
a
cree
lullaby
in
the
little
home
some
day
mélisse
will
be
singing
that
same
way
over
there
and
it
will
be
for
you
jan
thoreau
as
my
iowaka
is
now
singing
for
me
an
hour
later
jan
went
slowly
across
the
open
to
cummins
cabin
as
he
paused
for
an
instant
at
the
door
he
heard
a
laugh
that
was
strange
to
him
and
when
he
opened
it
to
enter
he
stood
perplexed
and
undecided
mélisse
had
risen
from
the
table
at
the
sound
of
his
approach
and
his
eyes
quickly
passed
from
her
flushed
face
to
the
young
man
who
was
sitting
opposite
her
he
caught
a
nervous
tremble
in
her
voice
when
she
said
dixon
this
is
my
brother
the
stranger
jumped
to
his
feet
and
held
out
a
hand
i
glad
to
know
you
cummins
thoreau
corrected
jan
quietly
as
he
took
the
extended
hand
jan
thoreau
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
he
turned
inquiringly
to
mélisse
the
flush
deepened
in
her
cheeks
as
she
began
to
gather
up
the
dishes
we
are
of
no
relation
continued
jan
something
impelling
him
to
speak
the
words
with
cool
precision
only
we
have
lived
under
the
same
roof
since
she
was
a
baby
and
so
we
have
come
to
be
like
brother
and
sister
miss
mélisse
has
been
telling
me
about
your
wonderful
run
this
morning
exclaimed
the
young
englishman
his
face
reddening
slightly
as
he
detected
the
girl
embarrassment
i
wish
i
had
seen
it
there
will
be
plenty
of
it
very
soon
replied
jan
caught
by
the
frankness
of
the
other
manner
our
runners
will
be
going
out
among
the
trappers
within
a
fortnight
and
will
they
take
me
you
may
go
with
me
if
you
can
run
i
leave
the
day
after
thanks
said
dixon
moving
toward
the
door
mélisse
did
not
lift
her
head
as
he
went
out
faintly
she
said
i
kept
your
dinner
for
you
why
did
you
come
sooner
i
had
dinner
with
gravois
he
replied
jean
said
that
you
would
hardly
be
prepared
for
five
mélisse
so
i
accepted
his
invitation
he
took
down
from
the
wall
a
fur
in
which
mélisse
had
mended
a
rent
a
day
or
two
before
and
throwing
it
over
his
arm
turned
to
leave
jan
he
faced
her
slowly
knowing
that
in
spite
of
himself
there
was
a
strangeness
in
his
manner
which
she
would
not
understand
why
are
you
going
away
the
day
after
two
weeks
before
the
others
you
did
tell
me
i
going
a
hundred
miles
into
the
south
he
answered
over
the
nelson
house
trail
yes
oh
her
lips
curled
slightly
as
she
looked
at
him
then
she
laughed
and
a
bright
spot
leaped
into
either
cheek
i
understand
brother
she
said
softly
pardon
me
for
questioning
you
so
i
had
forgotten
that
the
macveigh
girl
lives
on
the
nelson
trail
iowaka
says
that
she
is
as
sweet
as
a
wild
flower
i
wish
you
would
have
her
come
up
and
visit
us
some
time
jan
face
went
red
then
white
but
mélisse
saw
only
the
first
effect
of
her
random
shot
and
was
briskly
gathering
up
the
dishes
i
turn
off
into
the
cree
lake
country
before
i
reach
macveighs
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
but
the
words
hung
upon
his
lips
and
he
remained
silent
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
talking
with
jean
de
gravois
the
little
frenchman
face
was
ominously
dark
and
he
puffed
furiously
upon
his
pipe
when
jan
told
him
why
he
was
leaving
at
once
for
the
south
running
away
he
repeated
for
the
tenth
time
in
french
his
thin
lips
curling
in
a
sneer
i
am
sorry
that
i
gave
you
my
oath
jan
thoreau
else
i
would
go
myself
and
tell
mélisse
what
i
read
in
the
papers
pish
why
ca
you
forget
i
may
some
day
said
that
is
why
i
am
going
into
the
south
two
weeks
early
and
i
shall
be
gone
until
after
the
big
roast
if
i
remain
here
another
week
i
shall
tell
mélisse
and
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
despairingly
and
then
what
i
should
go
away
for
ever
jean
snapped
his
fingers
with
a
low
laugh
then
remain
another
week
jan
thoreau
and
if
it
turns
out
as
you
say
i
swear
i
will
abandon
my
two
iowakas
and
little
jean
to
the
wolves
i
am
going
the
day
after
the
next
morning
iowaka
complained
to
mélisse
that
gravois
was
as
surly
as
a
bear
a
wonderful
change
has
come
over
him
she
said
he
does
nothing
but
shrug
his
shoulders
and
say
diable
and
fool
last
night
i
could
hardly
sleep
because
of
his
growling
i
wonder
what
bad
spirit
has
come
into
my
jean
mélisse
was
wondering
the
same
of
she
saw
little
of
him
during
the
day
at
noon
dixon
told
her
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
accompany
thoreau
on
the
trip
south
the
following
morning
before
she
was
up
jan
had
gone
she
was
deeply
hurt
never
before
had
he
left
on
one
of
his
long
trips
without
spending
his
last
moments
with
her
she
had
purposely
told
her
father
to
entertain
the
agent
and
his
son
at
the
store
that
evening
so
that
jan
might
have
an
opportunity
of
bidding
her
alone
outside
of
her
thoughts
of
jan
the
days
and
evenings
that
followed
were
pleasant
ones
for
her
the
new
agent
was
as
jolly
as
he
was
fat
and
took
an
immense
liking
to
mélisse
young
dixon
was
and
brimming
with
life
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
time
in
her
company
for
hours
at
a
time
she
listened
to
his
stories
of
the
wonderful
world
across
the
sea
as
macdonald
had
described
that
life
to
jan
at
fort
churchill
so
he
told
of
it
to
mélisse
filling
her
with
visions
of
great
cities
painting
picture
after
picture
until
her
imagination
was
riot
with
the
beauty
and
the
marvel
of
it
all
and
she
listened
with
flaming
cheeks
and
glowing
eyes
one
day
a
week
after
jan
had
gone
he
told
her
about
the
women
in
the
world
which
had
come
to
be
a
to
mélisse
they
are
all
beautiful
over
there
she
asked
wonderingly
when
he
had
finished
many
of
them
are
beautiful
but
none
so
beautiful
as
you
mélisse
he
replied
leaning
near
to
her
his
eyes
shining
do
you
know
that
you
are
beautiful
his
words
frightened
her
so
much
that
she
bowed
her
head
to
hide
the
signs
of
it
in
her
face
jan
had
often
spoken
those
same
words
a
thousand
times
he
had
told
her
that
she
was
beautiful
but
there
bad
never
been
this
fluttering
of
her
heart
before
there
were
few
things
which
iowaka
and
she
did
not
hold
in
secret
between
them
and
a
day
or
two
later
mélisse
told
her
friend
what
dixon
had
said
for
the
first
time
iowaka
abused
the
confidence
placed
in
her
and
told
jean
le
diable
gritted
jean
his
face
blackening
he
said
no
more
until
night
when
the
children
were
asleep
then
he
drew
iowaka
close
beside
him
on
a
bench
near
the
stove
and
asked
carelessly
mon
ange
if
one
makes
an
oath
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
breaks
it
what
happens
he
evaded
the
startled
look
in
his
wife
big
black
eyes
it
means
that
one
will
be
for
ever
damned
unless
he
confesses
to
a
priest
soon
after
does
it
ma
chérie
and
if
there
is
no
priest
nearer
than
four
hundred
miles
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
is
it
not
but
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
if
one
might
have
the
oath
broken
and
not
do
it
himself
what
then
i
do
know
said
iowaka
simply
staring
at
him
in
amazed
questioning
nor
do
i
said
jean
lighting
his
pipe
but
there
is
enough
of
the
devil
in
jean
de
gravois
to
make
him
break
a
thousand
oaths
if
it
was
for
you
my
iowaka
her
eyes
glowed
upon
him
softly
a
maiden
soul
leaves
her
body
when
she
becomes
the
wife
of
the
man
she
loves
she
whispered
tenderly
in
cree
resting
her
dark
head
on
jean
shoulder
that
is
what
my
people
believe
jean
and
if
i
have
given
my
soul
to
you
why
should
i
not
break
oath
for
you
for
me
alone
iowaka
for
you
alone
and
not
for
a
friend
for
no
one
else
in
the
world
jean
you
are
the
only
one
to
whom
the
god
of
my
people
bids
me
make
all
sacrifice
but
you
do
not
believe
in
that
god
iowaka
sometimes
it
is
better
to
believe
in
the
god
of
my
people
than
in
yours
she
replied
gently
i
believed
in
him
fifteen
years
ago
at
churchill
do
you
wish
me
to
take
back
what
i
gave
to
you
then
with
a
low
cry
of
happiness
jean
crushed
his
face
against
her
soft
cheek
believe
in
him
always
my
iowaka
and
jean
de
gravois
will
cut
the
throat
of
any
missioner
who
says
you
will
not
go
to
paradise
but
this
other
you
are
sure
that
you
would
break
oath
for
none
but
me
and
the
children
they
are
a
part
of
you
jean
a
fierce
snarling
and
barking
of
dogs
brought
gravois
to
the
door
they
could
hear
croisset
raucous
voice
and
the
loud
cracking
of
his
big
whip
i
be
back
soon
said
jean
closing
the
door
after
him
but
instead
of
approaching
croisset
and
the
fighting
dogs
he
went
in
the
direction

a
kiss
and
the
consequences
during
the
week
that
followed
jean
little
black
eyes
were
never
far
distant
from
cummins
cabin
without
being
observed
he
watched
mélisse
and
dixon
and
not
even
to
iowaka
did
he
give
hint
of
his
growing
suspicions
dixon
was
a
man
whom
most
other
men
liked
there
were
a
fascinating
frankness
in
his
voice
and
manner
strength
in
his
broad
shoulders
and
a
general
air
of
comradeship
about
him
which
won
all
but
jean
the
runners
began
leaving
the
post
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
and
after
this
mélisse
and
the
young
englishman
were
more
together
than
ever
dixon
showed
no
inclination
to
accompany
the
sledges
and
when
they
were
gone
he
and
mélisse
began
taking
walks
in
the
forest
when
the
sun
was
high
and
warm
it
was
on
one
of
these
days
that
jean
had
gone
along
the
edge
of
the
caribou
swamp
that
lay
between
the
barrens
and
the
higher
forest
as
he
stopped
to
examine
a
fresh
lynx
trail
that
cut
across
the
path
beaten
down
by
dog
and
sledge
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
ahead
of
him
and
a
moment
later
he
recognized
them
as
those
of
mélisse
and
dixon
his
face
clouded
and
his
eyes
snapped
fire
ah
if
i
was
only
jan
thoreau
a
jan
thoreau
with
the
heart
of
jean
de
gravois
what
a
surprise
i
give
that
foreigner
he
said
to
himself
leaping
quickly
from
the
trail
into
the
thicket
he
peered
forth
from
the
bushes
his
loyal
heart
beating
a
wrathful
tattoo
when
he
saw
that
dixon
dared
put
his
hand
on
arm
they
were
coming
very
slowly
the
englishman
bending
low
over
the
bowed
head
talking
to
her
with
strange
earnestness
suddenly
he
stopped
and
before
jean
could
comprehend
what
had
happened
he
had
bent
down
and
kissed
her
with
a
low
cry
mélisse
tore
herself
free
for
an
instant
she
faced
dixon
who
stood
laughing
into
her
blazing
eyes
then
she
turned
and
ran
swiftly
down
the
trail
a
second
cry
fell
from
her
startled
lips
when
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
jean
de
gravois
the
little
frenchman
was
smiling
his
eyes
glittered
like
black
diamonds
jean
jean
she
sobbed
running
to
him
he
has
insulted
you
he
said
softly
smiling
into
her
white
face
run
along
to
the
post
ma
belle
mélisse
he
watched
her
half
turned
from
the
astonished
englishman
until
she
disappeared
in
a
twist
of
the
trail
a
hundred
yards
away
then
he
faced
dixon
it
is
the
first
time
that
our
mélisse
has
ever
suffered
insult
he
said
speaking
as
coolly
as
if
to
a
child
if
jan
thoreau
were
here
he
would
kill
you
he
is
gone
and
i
will
kill
you
in
his
place
he
advanced
his
white
teeth
still
gleaming
in
a
smile
and
not
until
he
launched
himself
like
a
cat
at
dixon
throat
was
the
englishman
convinced
that
he
meant
attack
in
a
flash
dixon
stepped
a
little
to
one
side
and
sent
out
a
crashing
blow
that
caught
jean
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
sent
him
flat
upon
his
back
in
the
trail
half
stunned
gravois
came
to
his
feet
he
did
not
hear
the
shrill
cry
of
terror
from
the
twist
in
the
trail
he
did
not
look
back
to
see
mélisse
standing
there
but
dixon
both
saw
and
heard
and
he
laughed
tauntingly
over
jean
head
as
the
little
frenchman
came
toward
him
again
more
cautiously
than
before
it
was
the
first
time
that
jean
had
ever
come
into
contact
with
science
he
darted
in
again
in
his
quick
way
and
received
a
blow
that
dazed
him
this
time
he
held
to
his
feet
bah
this
is
like
striking
a
baby
exclaimed
dixon
what
are
you
fighting
about
gravois
is
it
a
crime
up
here
to
kiss
a
pretty
girl
i
am
going
to
kill
you
said
jean
as
coolly
as
before
there
was
something
terribly
calm
and
decisive
in
his
voice
he
was
not
excited
he
was
not
afraid
his
fingers
did
not
go
near
the
long
knife
in
his
belt
slowly
the
laugh
faded
from
dixon
face
and
tense
lines
gathered
around
his
mouth
as
jean
circled
about
him
come
we
do
want
trouble
like
this
he
urged
i
sorry
if
mélisse
did
like
it
i
am
going
to
kill
you
repeated
jean
there
was
an
appalling
confidence
in
his
eyes
from
those
eyes
dixon
found
himself
retreating
rather
than
from
the
man
they
followed
him
never
taking
themselves
from
his
face
the
fire
in
them
grew
deeper
two
dull
red
spots
began
to
glow
in
jean
cheeks
and
he
laughed
softly
when
he
suddenly
leaped
in
so
that
the
englishman
struck
at
him
and
missed
it
was
the
science
of
the
forest
man
pitted
against
that
of
another
world
for
sport
jean
had
played
with
wounded
lynx
his
was
the
quickness
of
sight
of
instinct
without
the
other
science
the
quickness
of
the
great
loon
that
had
often
played
this
same
game
with
his
of
the
whose
ripping
fangs
carried
death
so
quickly
that
eyes
could
not
follow
a
third
and
a
fourth
time
he
came
within
striking
distance
and
escaped
he
half
drew
his
knife
and
at
the
movement
dixon
sprang
back
until
his
shoulders
touched
the
brush
smilingly
gravois
unsheathed
the
blade
and
tossed
it
behind
him
in
the
trail
his
eyes
were
like
a
serpent
in
their
steadiness
and
the
muscles
of
his
body
were
drawn
as
tight
as
steel
springs
ready
to
loose
themselves
when
the
chance
came
there
were
tricks
in
his
fighting
as
well
as
in
the
other
and
a
dawning
of
it
began
to
grow
upon
dixon
he
dropped
his
arms
to
his
side
inviting
jean
within
reach
suddenly
the
little
frenchman
straightened
his
glittering
eyes
shot
from
the
englishman
face
to
the
brush
behind
him
and
a
piercing
yell
burst
from
his
lips
involuntarily
dixon
started
half
turning
his
face
and
before
he
had
come
to
his
guard
gravois
flung
himself
under
his
arms
striking
with
the
full
force
of
his
body
against
his
antagonist
knees
together
they
went
down
in
the
trail
there
was
only
one
science
now
that
of
the
forest
man
the
lithe
brown
fingers
that
could
have
crushed
the
life
of
a
lynx
fastened
themselves
around
the
man
throat
and
there
came
one
gasping
quickly
throttled
cry
as
they
tightened
in
their
grip
i
will
kill
you
said
jean
again
dixon
arms
fell
limply
to
his
side
his
eyes
bulged
from
their
sockets
his
mouth
was
agape
but
jean
did
not
see
his
face
was
buried
on
the
other
shoulder
the
whole
life
of
him
in
the
grip
he
would
not
have
raised
his
head
for
a
full
minute
longer
had
there
not
come
a
sudden
interruption
the
terrified
voice
of
mélisse
the
frantic
tearing
of
her
hands
at
his
hands
he
is
dead
she
shrieked
you
have
killed
him
jean
he
loosed
his
fingers
and
sat
up
mélisse
staggered
back
clutching
with
her
hands
at
her
breast
her
face
as
white
as
the
snow
you
have
killed
him
jean
looked
into
dixon
eyes
he
is
not
dead
he
said
rising
and
going
to
her
side
come
ma
chère
run
home
to
iowaka
i
will
not
kill
him
her
slender
form
shook
with
agonized
sobs
as
he
led
her
to
the
turn
in
the
trail
run
home
to
iowaka
he
repeated
gently
i
will
not
kill
him
mélisse
he
went
back
to
dixon
and
rubbed
snow
over
the
man
face
mon
dieu
but
it
was
near
to
it
he
exclaimed
as
there
came
a
flicker
of
life
into
the
eyes
a
little
more
and
he
would
have
been
with
the
missioner
he
dragged
the
englishman
to
the
side
of
the
trail
and
set
his
back
to
a
tree
when
he
saw
that
fallen
foeman
breath
was
coming
more
strongly
he
followed
slowly
after
mélisse
unobserved
he
went
into
the
store
and
washed
the
blood
from
his
face
chuckling
with
huge
satisfaction
when
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
little
glass
which
hung
over
the
ah
my
sweet
iowaka
but
would
you
guess
now
that
jean
de
gravois
had
received
two
clouts
on
the
side
of
the
head
that
almost
sent
him
into
the
blessed
hereafter
i
would
not
have
had
you
see
it
for
all
the
gold
in
this
world
a
little
later
he
went
to
the
cabin
iowaka
and
the
children
were
at
croisset
and
he
sat
down
to
smoke
a
pipe
scarce
had
he
begun
sending
up
blue
clouds
of
smoke
when
the
door
opened
and
mélisse
came
in
hello
ma
chère
he
cried
gaily
laughing
at
her
with
a
wave
of
his
pipe
in
an
instant
she
had
flung
the
shawl
from
her
head
and
was
upon
her
knees
at
his
feet
her
white
face
turned
up
to
him
pleadingly
her
breath
falling
upon
him
in
panting
sobbing
excitement
jean
jean
she
whispered
stretching
up
her
hands
to
his
face
please
tell
me
that
you
will
never
tell
jan
please
tell
me
that
you
never
will
jean
never
never
never
i
will
say
nothing
mélisse
never
jean
never
for
a
sobbing
breath
she
dropped
her
head
upon
his
knees
then
suddenly
she
drew
down
his
face
and
kissed
him
thank
you
jean
for
what
you
have
done
mon
dieu
gasped
jean
when
she
had
gone
what
if
iowaka
had
been
here
then
chapter
xxi
a
broken
heart
the
day
following
the
fight
in
the
forest
dixon
found
jean
de
gravois
alone
and
came
up
to
him
gravois
will
you
shake
hands
with
me
he
said
i
want
to
thank
you
for
what
you
did
to
me
yesterday
i
deserved
it
i
have
asked
miss
mélisse
to
forgive
me
and
i
want
to
shake
hands
with
you
jean
was
thunderstruck
he
had
never
met
this
kind
of
man
que
diantre
he
ejaculated
when
he
had
come
to
his
senses
yes
i
will
shake
hands
for
several
days
after
this
jean
could
see
that
mélisse
made
an
effort
to
evade
him
she
did
not
visit
iowaka
when
he
was
in
the
cabin
neither
did
she
and
dixon
go
again
into
the
forest
the
young
englishman
spent
more
of
his
time
at
the
store
and
just
before
the
trappers
began
coming
in
he
went
on
a
with
croisset
the
change
delighted
jean
the
first
time
he
met
mélisse
after
the
fight
his
eyes
flashed
pleasure
jan
will
surely
be
coming
home
soon
he
greeted
her
what
if
the
birds
tell
him
what
happened
out
there
on
the
trail
she
flushed
scarlet
perhaps
the
same
birds
will
tell
us
what
has
happened
down
on
the
nelson
house
trail
jean
she
retorted
pouf
jan
thoreau
does
give
the
snap
of
his
small
finger
for
the
macveigh
girl
jean
replied
warm
in
defense
of
his
friend
she
is
pretty
laughed
mélisse
and
i
have
just
learned
that
is
why
men
like
to
like
them
i
mean
jean
strutted
before
her
like
a
peacock
am
i
pretty
mélisse
then
why
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
suggestively
in
the
cabin
because
you
were
brave
jean
i
love
brave
men
you
were
glad
that
i
pummeled
the
stranger
then
mélisse
did
not
answer
but
he
caught
a
laughing
sparkle
in
the
corner
of
her
eye
as
she
left
him
come
home
jan
thoreau
he
hummed
softly
as
he
went
to
the
store
come
home
come
home
come
home
for
the
little
mélisse
has
grown
into
a
woman
and
is
learning
to
use
her
eyes
among
the
first
of
the
trappers
to
come
in
with
his
furs
was
macveigh
he
brought
word
that
jan
had
gone
south
to
spend
the
annual
holiday
at
nelson
house
and
cummings
told
mélisse
whence
the
message
came
he
did
not
observe
the
slight
change
that
came
into
her
face
and
went
on
i
do
understand
this
in
jan
he
is
needed
here
for
the
carnival
did
you
know
that
he
was
going
to
nelson
house
mélisse
shook
her
head
macveigh
says
they
have
made
him
an
offer
to
go
down
there
as
chief
man
continued
the
factor
it
is
strange
that
he
has
sent
no
explanation
to
me
it
was
a
week
after
the
big
caribou
roast
before
jan
returned
to
lac
bain
mélisse
saw
him
drive
in
from
the
churchill
trail
but
while
her
heart
fluttered
excitedly
she
steeled
herself
to
meet
him
with
at
least
an
equal
show
of
the
calm
indifference
with
which
he
had
left
her
six
weeks
before
the
coolness
of
his
still
rankled
bitterly
in
her
bosom
he
had
not
kissed
her
he
had
not
even
passed
his
last
evening
with
her
but
she
was
not
prepared
for
the
changed
jan
thoreau
who
came
slowly
through
the
cabin
door
his
hair
and
beard
had
grown
covering
the
smooth
cheeks
which
he
had
always
kept
closely
shaven
his
eyes
glowed
with
dull
pleasure
as
she
stood
waiting
for
him
but
there
was
none
of
the
old
flash
and
fire
in
them
there
was
a
strangeness
in
his
manner
an
uneasiness
in
the
shifting
of
his
eyes
which
caused
the
flush
to
fade
slowly
from
her
cheeks
before
either
had
spoken
she
had
never
known
this
jan
before
and
her
fortitude
left
her
as
she
approached
him
wonderingly
silent
her
hands
reaching
out
to
him
jan
she
said
her
voice
trembled
her
lips
quivered
there
was
the
old
glorious
pleading
in
her
eyes
and
before
it
jan
bowed
his
unkempt
head
and
crushed
her
hands
tightly
in
his
own
for
a
there
was
silence
and
in
that
there
came
a
century
between
them
at
last
jan
spoke
i
glad
to
see
you
again
mélisse
it
has
seemed
like
a
very
long
time
he
lifted
his
eyes
before
them
the
girl
involuntarily
shrank
back
and
jan
freed
her
hands
in
them
she
saw
none
of
the
old
nothing
of
their
old
comradeship
inscrutable
reflecting
no
visible
emotion
they
passed
from
her
to
the
violin
hanging
on
the
wall
i
have
not
played
in
so
long
he
said
turning
from
her
that
i
believe
i
have
forgotten
he
took
down
the
instrument
and
his
fingers
traveled
clumsily
over
the
strings
his
teeth
gleamed
at
her
from
out
his
growth
of
beard
as
he
said
ah
you
must
play
for
me
now
mélisse
it
has
surely
gone
from
jan
thoreau
he
held
out
the
violin
to
her
not
now
jan
she
said
tremulously
i
will
play
for
you
she
went
to
the
door
of
her
room
hesitating
for
a
moment
with
her
back
to
him
you
will
come
to
supper
jan
surely
mélisse
if
you
are
prepared
he
hung
up
the
violin
as
she
closed
the
door
and
went
from
the
cabin
jean
de
gravois
and
iowaka
were
watching
for
him
and
jean
hurried
across
the
open
to
meet
him
i
am
coming
to
offer
you
the
loan
of
my
razor
he
cried
gaily
iowaka
says
that
you
will
be
taken
for
a
bear
if
the
trappers
see
you
a
beard
is
good
to
keep
off
the
black
flies
replied
it
is
approaching
summer
and
the
black
flies
love
to
feast
upon
me
let
us
go
down
the
trail
jean
i
want
to
speak
with
you
where
there
had
been
in
the
deep
spruce
they
sat
down
facing
each
other
jan
spoke
in
french
i
have
traveled
far
since
leaving
lac
bain
he
said
i
went
first
to
nelson
house
and
from
here
to
the
wholdaia
i
found
them
at
nelson
house
but
not
on
the
wholdaia
what
asked
jean
though
he
knew
well
what
the
other
meant
my
brothers
jean
de
gravois
answered
jan
drawing
his
lips
until
his
teeth
gleamed
in
a
sneering
smile
my
brothers
les
bêtes
de
charogne
devil
take
croisset
for
telling
you
where
they
were
muttered
jean
under
his
breath
i
saw
the
two
at
nelson
house
continued
one
of
them
is
a
and
the
other
he
hunched
his
shoulders
is
worse
petraud
one
of
the
two
who
were
at
wholdaia
was
killed
by
a
cree
father
last
winter
for
dishonoring
his
daughter
the
other
disappeared
jean
was
silent
his
head
leaning
forward
his
face
resting
in
his
hands
so
you
see
jean
de
gravois
what
sort
of
creature
is
your
friend
jan
thoreau
jean
raised
his
head
until
his
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
those
of
his
companion
i
see
that
you
are
a
bigger
fool
than
ever
he
said
quietly
jan
thoreau
what
if
i
should
break
my
oath
and
tell
mélisse
unflinching
the
men
eyes
met
a
dull
glare
came
into
jan
slowly
he
unsheathed
his
long
knife
and
placed
it
upon
the
snow
between
his
feet
with
the
gleaming
end
of
the
blade
pointing
toward
gravois
with
a
low
cry
jean
sprang
to
his
feet
do
you
mean
that
jan
thoreau
do
you
mean
to
give
the
to
one
who
has
staked
his
life
for
you
and
who
loves
you
as
a
brother
yes
said
jan
deliberately
i
love
you
jean
more
than
any
other
man
in
the
world
and
yet
i
will
kill
you
if
you
betray
me
to
mélisse
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stretched
out
his
hands
to
the
little
frenchman
jean
would
you
do
as
i
am
doing
would
you
have
done
as
much
for
iowaka
for
a
moment
gravois
was
silent
i
would
not
have
taken
her
love
without
telling
her
he
said
then
that
is
not
what
you
and
i
know
as
honor
jan
thoreau
but
i
would
have
gone
to
her
as
you
should
now
go
to
mélisse
and
she
would
have
opened
her
arms
to
me
as
mélisse
would
opens
hers
to
you
that
is
what
i
would
have
done
and
that
is
what
i
shall
never
do
said
jan
decisively
turning
toward
the
post
i
could
kill
myself
more
easily
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
jean
no
one
but
you
and
i
must
ever
know
i
would
like
to
choke
that
fool
of
a
croisset
for
sending
you
to
hunt
up
those
people
at
nelson
house
and
wholdaia
grumbled
jean
it
was
best
for
me
they
saw
mélisse
leaving
iowaka
home
when
they
came
from
the
forest
both
waved
their
hands
to
her
and
jan
cut
across
the
open
to
the
store
jean
went
to
the
cummins
cabin
as
soon
as
he
was
sure
that
he
was
not
observed
there
was
little
of
the
old
vivacity
in
his
manner
as
he
greeted
mélisse
he
noted
too
that
the
girl
was
not
her
natural
self
there
was
a
redness
under
her
eyes
which
told
him
that
she
had
been
crying
mélisse
he
said
at
last
speaking
to
her
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
cap
he
was
twisting
in
his
fingers
there
has
come
a
great
change
over
a
very
great
change
jean
if
i
were
to
guess
i
should
say
that
his
heart
has
been
broken
down
on
the
nelson
trail
gravois
caught
the
sharp
meaning
in
her
voice
which
trembled
a
little
as
she
spoke
he
was
before
her
in
an
instant
his
cap
fallen
to
the
floor
his
eyes
blazing
as
he
caught
her
by
the
arms
yes
the
heart
of
jan
thoreau
is
broken
he
cried
but
it
has
been
broken
by
nothing
that
lives
on
the
nelson
house
trail
it
is
broken
because
of
you
i
mélisse
drew
back
from
him
with
a
breathless
cry
i
i
have
broken
i
did
not
say
that
interrupted
jean
i
say
that
it
is
broken
because
of
you
mon
dieu
if
only
i
might
tell
you
jean
please
tell
me
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
her
eyes
implored
him
tell
me
what
i
have
done
what
i
can
do
jean
i
can
say
that
much
to
you
and
no
more
he
said
quietly
only
know
this
ma
chère
that
there
is
a
great
grief
eating
at
the
soul
of
jan
thoreau
and
that
because
of
this
grief
he
is
changed
i
know
what
this
grief
is
but
i
am
pledged
never
to
reveal
it
it
is
for
you
to
find
out
and
to
do
this
above
all
else
let
him
know
that
you
love
him
the
color
had
faded
from
her
startled
face
but
now
it
came
back
again
in
a
swift
flood
that
i
love
him
yes
not
as
a
sister
any
longer
mélisse
but
as
a
woman
chapter
xxii
her
promise
gravois
did
not
stay
to
see
the
effect
of
his
last
words
only
he
knew
as
he
went
through
the
door
that
her
eyes
were
following
him
and
that
if
he
looked
at
her
she
would
call
him
back
so
he
shut
the
door
quickly
behind
him
fearing
that
he
had
already
said
too
much
cummins
and
jan
came
in
together
at
suppertime
the
factor
was
in
high
humor
an
indian
from
the
porcupine
had
brought
in
two
silver
fox
that
morning
and
he
was
immensely
pleased
at
jan
return
a
combination
of
incidents
which
put
him
in
the
best
of
moods
mélisse
sat
opposite
jan
at
the
table
she
had
twisted
a
sprig
of
red
bakneesh
into
her
glossy
braid
and
a
cluster
of
it
nestled
at
her
throat
but
jan
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
noticed
this
little
favor
which
was
meant
entirely
for
him
he
smiled
at
her
but
there
was
a
clear
coolness
in
the
depths
of
his
dark
eyes
which
checked
any
of
the
old
familiarity
on
her
part
has
macveigh
put
in
his
new
cummins
inquired
after
asking
jan
many
questions
about
his
trip
i
do
know
replied
i
did
go
to
macveighs
purposely
he
held
his
eyes
from
mélisse
she
understood
his
effort
and
a
quick
flush
gathered
in
her
cheeks
it
was
macveigh
who
brought
in
word
of
you
persisted
the
factor
oblivious
of
the
effect
of
his
questions
i
met
him
in
the
cree
lake
country
but
he
said
nothing
of
his
he
rose
from
the
table
with
cummins
and
started
to
follow
him
from
the
cabin
mélisse
came
between
for
a
moment
her
hand
rested
upon
his
arm
you
are
going
to
stay
with
me
jan
she
smiled
i
want
your
help
with
the
dishes
and
then
we
going
to
play
on
the
violin
she
pulled
him
into
a
chair
as
cummins
left
and
tied
an
apron
about
his
shoulders
close
your
eyes
and
do
move
she
commanded
laughing
into
his
surprised
face
as
she
ran
into
her
room
a
moment
later
she
returned
with
one
hand
held
behind
her
back
the
hot
blood
surged
through
jan
veins
when
he
felt
her
fingers
running
gently
through
his
long
hair
there
came
the
snip
of
scissors
a
little
nervous
laugh
close
to
his
head
and
then
again
the
snip
snip
snip
of
the
scissors
it
terribly
long
jan
her
soft
hand
brushed
his
bearded
cheek
ugh
she
shuddered
you
must
take
that
off
your
face
if
you
do
why
he
asked
through
lack
of
anything
else
to
say
she
lowered
her
head
until
her
cheek
pressed
against
his
own
because
it
feels
like
bristles
she
whispered
she
reddened
fiercely
when
he
remained
silent
and
the
scissors
snipped
more
rapidly
between
her
fingers
i
going
to
prospect
the
big
swamp
along
the
edge
of
the
barrens
this
summer
he
explained
soon
laughing
to
relieve
the
tension
a
beard
will
protect
me
from
the
black
flies
you
can
grow
another
she
took
the
apron
from
about
his
shoulders
and
held
it
so
that
he
could
see
the
result
of
her
work
he
looked
up
smiling
thank
you
mélisse
do
you
remember
when
you
last
cut
my
hair
yes
it
was
over
on
the
mountain
we
had
taken
the
scissors
along
for
cutting
bakneesh
and
you
looked
so
like
a
wild
indian
that
i
made
you
sit
on
a
rock
and
let
me
trim
it
and
you
cut
my
ear
he
reminded
for
which
you
made
me
pay
she
retorted
quickly
almost
under
her
breath
she
went
to
the
cupboard
behind
the
stove
and
brought
out
her
and
razor
i
insist
that
you
shall
use
them
she
said
stirring
the
soap
into
a
lather
and
noting
the
indecision
in
his
face
i
am
afraid
of
you
afraid
of
me
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
front
of
the
little
mirror
turning
his
face
from
side
to
side
mélisse
handed
him
the
razor
and
cup
you
do
seem
like
the
jan
that
i
used
to
know
once
upon
a
time
there
has
been
a
great
change
in
you
since
since
she
hesitated
since
when
mélisse
since
the
day
we
came
in
from
the
mountain
and
i
put
up
my
hair
with
timid
sweetness
she
added
i
have
had
it
up
again
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
lathered
face
in
the
glass
staring
at
her
with
big
seeking
eyes
he
turned
them
quickly
away
when
he
saw
that
she
was
looking
and
mélisse
set
to
work
at
the
dishes
she
had
washed
them
before
he
finished
shaving
then
she
took
down
the
old
violin
from
the
wall
and
began
to
play
her
low
sweet
voice
accompanying
the
instrument
in
a
cree
melody
which
iowaka
had
taught
her
during
absence
at
nelson
house
and
the
wholdaia
surprised
he
faced
her
his
eyes
glowing
as
there
fell
from
her
lips
the
gentle
of
a
indian
maiden
filled
with
its
infinite
sadness
and
despair
he
knew
the
song
it
was
a
lyric
of
the
crees
he
had
heard
it
before
but
never
as
it
came
to
him
now
sobbing
its
grief
in
the
low
notes
of
the
violin
speaking
to
him
with
immeasurable
pathos
from
the
trembling
throat
of
mélisse
he
stood
silent
until
she
had
finished
staring
down
upon
her
bowed
head
when
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
he
saw
that
her
long
lashes
were
wet
and
glistening
in
the
it
is
wonderful
mélisse
you
have
made
beautiful
music
for
it
thank
you
she
played
again
her
voice
humming
with
exquisite
sweetness
the
wordless
music
which
he
had
taught
her
at
last
she
gave
him
the
violin
now
you
must
play
for
me
i
have
forgotten
a
great
deal
mélisse
she
was
astonished
to
see
how
clumsily
his
brown
fingers
traveled
over
the
strings
as
she
watched
him
her
heart
thrilled
uneasily
it
was
not
the
old
jan
who
was
playing
for
her
now
but
a
new
jan
whose
eyes
shone
dull
and
passionless
in
whom
there
was
no
stir
of
the
old
spirit
of
the
violin
he
wandered
listlessly
from
one
thing
to
another
and
after
a
few
minutes
gave
her
the
instrument
again
without
speaking
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
hung
the
violin
upon
the
wall
you
must
practise
a
great
deal
she
said
quietly
at
her
movement
he
too
rose
from
his
seat
and
when
she
turned
to
him
again
he
had
his
cap
in
his
hand
a
flash
of
surprise
shot
into
her
eyes
are
you
going
so
soon
jan
i
am
tired
he
said
in
excuse
it
has
been
two
days
since
i
have
slept
mélisse
good
night
he
smiled
at
her
from
the
door
but
the
good
night
which
fell
from
her
lips
was
lifeless
and
unmeaning
jan
shivered
when
he
went
out
under
the
cold
stars
he
clenched
his
hands
knowing
that
he
had
come
from
the
cabin
none
too
soon
choking
back
the
grief
of
this
last
meeting
with
mélisse
he
crossed
to
the
company
store
it
was
late
when
cummins
returned
home
mélisse
was
still
up
he
looked
at
her
sharply
over
his
shoulder
as
he
hung
up
his
coat
and
hat
has
anything
come
between
you
and
jan
he
asked
suddenly
why
have
you
been
crying
sometimes
the
tears
come
when
i
am
playing
the
violin
father
i
know
of
nothing
that
has
come
between
jan
and
me
only
i
i
understand
she
stopped
struggling
hard
to
keep
back
the
sobs
that
were
trembling
in
her
throat
neither
do
i
understand
exclaimed
the
factor
going
to
the
stove
to
light
his
pipe
he
gave
me
his
resignation
as
a
paid
servant
of
the
company
tonight
he
is
not
going
to
leave
the
post
breathed
mélisse
he
is
leaving
the
service
reiterated
her
father
that
means
he
can
not
long
live
at
lac
bain
he
says
he
is
going
into
the
woods
perhaps
into
jean
country
of
the
athabasca
has
he
told
you
more
nothing
said
mélisse
she
was
upon
her
knees
in
front
of
the
little
bookcase
a
blinding
film
burned
in
her
eyes
she
caught
her
breath
struggling
hard
to
master
herself
before
she
faced
her
father
again
for
a
moment
the
factor
went
into
his
room
and
she
took
this
opportunity
of
slipping
into
her
own
calling
good
night
to
him
from
the
partly
closed
door
the
next
day
it
was
croisset
who
went
along
the
edge
of
the
barrens
for
meat
gravois
found
jan
filling
a
new
with
supplies
it
was
their
first
encounter
since
he
had
learned
that
jan
had
given
up
the
service
diable
he
fairly
hissed
standing
over
him
as
he
packed
his
flour
and
salt
in
a
rubber
bag
diable
i
say
jan
thoreau
jan
looked
up
smiling
to
see
the
little
frenchman
fairly
quivering
with
rage
bon
jour
jean
de
gravois
he
laughed
back
you
see
i
am
going
out
among
the
foxes
the
devils
snapped
jean
no
the
foxes
my
dear
jean
i
am
tired
of
the
post
i
can
make
better
wage
for
my
time
in
the
swamps
to
the
west
think
of
it
jean
it
has
been
many
years
since
you
have
trapped
there
and
the
foxes
must
be
eating
up
the
country
jean
thin
lips
were
almost
snarling
blessed
saints
and
it
was
i
who
he
spun
upon
his
heels
without
another
word
and
went
straight
to
mélisse
jan
thoreau
is
going
to
leave
the
post
he
announced
fiercely
throwing
out
his
chest
and
glaring
at
her
accusingly
so
father
has
told
me
said
mélisse
her
cheeks
were
colorless
and
there
were
purplish
lines
under
her
eyes
but
she
spoke
with
exceeding
calmness
mon
dieu
exclaimed
jean
whirling
again
you
take
it
coolly
a
little
later
mélisse
saw
jan
coming
from
the
store
when
he
entered
the
cabin
his
dark
face
betrayed
the
strain
under
which
he
was
laboring
but
his
voice
was
unnaturally
calm
i
have
come
to
say
mélisse
he
said
i
am
going
to
prospect
for
a
good
among
the
barrens
i
hope
you
will
have
good
luck
in
her
voice
too
was
a
firmness
almost
metallic
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
jan
held
out
his
hand
to
her
she
started
and
for
an
instant
the
blood
surged
from
her
heart
to
her
face
then
she
gave
him
her
own
and
looked
him
squarely
and
unflinchingly
in
the
eyes
will
you
wait
a
moment
she
asked
she
hurried
into
her
room
and
scarcely
had
she
gone
before
she
reappeared
again
this
time
with
a
flush
burning
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
shining
brightly
she
had
unbraided
her
hair
and
it
lay
coiled
upon
the
crown
of
her
head
glistening
with
crimson
sprigs
of
bakneesh
she
came
to
him
a
second
time
and
once
more
gave
him
her
hand
i
do
suppose
you
care
now
she
said
coldly
and
yet
laughing
in
his
face
i
have
not
broken
my
promise
it
was
silly
was
it
he
felt
as
if
his
blood
had
been
suddenly
chilled
to
water
and
he
fought
to
choke
back
the
thick
throbbing
in
his
throat
you
promised
he
could
not
go
further
i
promised
that
i
would
not
do
up
my
hair
again
until
you
had
forgotten
to
love
me
she
finished
for
him
i
will
do
it
up
now
he
bowed
his
head
and
she
could
see
his
shoulders
quiver
under
their
thick
caribou
coat
her
tense
lips
parted
and
she
raised
her
arms
as
if
on
the
point
of
stretching
them
out
to
him
but
his
voice
came
evenly
without
a
quiver
yet
filled
with
the
dispassionate
truth
of
what
he
spoke
i
have
not
forgotten
to
love
you
mélisse
i
shall
never
cease
to
love
my
little
sister
but
you
are
older
now
and
it
is
time
for
you
to
do
up
your
hair
he
turned
without
looking
at
her
again
leaving
her
standing
with
her
arms
still
half
stretched
out
to
him
and
went
from
the
cabin
jan
the
words
fell
in
a
sobbing
whisper
from
her
but
he
had
gone
too
far
to
hear
through
the
window
she
saw
him
shake
hands
with
cummins
in
front
of
the
company
store
she
watched
him
as
he
went
to
the
cabin
of
iowaka
and
jean
then
she
saw
him
shoulder
his
pack
and
with
bowed
head
disappear
slowly
into
the
depths
of
the
black
spruce
forest
chapter
xxiii
jan
returns
all
that
spring
and
summer
jan
spent
in
the
thick
caribou
swamps
and
low
along
the
barrens
it
was
two
months
before
he
appeared
at
the
post
again
and
then
he
remained
only
long
enough
to
patch
himself
up
and
secure
fresh
supplies
mélisse
had
suffered
quietly
during
these
two
months
a
grief
and
loneliness
filling
her
heart
which
none
knew
but
herself
even
from
iowaka
she
kept
her
unhappiness
a
secret
and
yet
when
the
gloom
had
settled
heaviest
upon
her
she
was
still
buoyed
up
by
a
persistent
hope
until
jan
last
visit
to
lac
bain
this
hope
never
quite
went
out
the
first
evening
after
his
arrival
from
the
swamps
to
the
west
he
came
to
the
cabin
his
beard
had
grown
again
his
hair
was
long
and
shaggy
and
fell
in
shining
dishevelment
upon
his
shoulders
the
sensitive
beauty
of
his
great
eyes
once
responsive
to
every
passing
humor
in
mélisse
flashing
fun
at
her
laughter
glowing
softly
in
their
devotion
was
gone
his
face
was
filled
with
the
silence
of
the
forest
man
firmly
and
yet
gently
it
repelled
whatever
of
the
old
things
she
might
have
said
and
done
holding
her
away
from
him
as
if
by
power
of
a
strong
hand
this
time
mélisse
knew
that
there
was
left
not
even
the
last
comforting
spark
of
hope
within
her
bosom
jan
had
gone
out
of
her
life
for
ever
leaving
to
her
as
a
haunting
ghost
of
what
they
two
had
once
been
to
each
other
the
old
violin
on
the
cabin
wall
after
he
went
away
again
the
violin
became
more
and
more
to
her
what
it
had
once
been
to
him
she
played
it
as
he
had
played
it
sobbing
her
loneliness
and
her
through
its
strings
in
lone
hours
clasping
it
to
her
breast
and
speaking
to
it
as
jan
had
talked
to
it
in
years
gone
by
if
you
could
only
tell
me
if
you
only
could
she
whispered
to
it
one
day
when
the
autumn
was
drawing
near
if
you
could
tell
me
about
him
and
what
i
might
do
dear
old
violin
once
during
the
autumn
jan
came
in
for
supplies
and
traps
and
his
dogs
and
sledge
he
was
planning
to
spend
the
winter
two
hundred
miles
to
the
west
in
the
country
of
the
athabasca
he
was
at
lac
bain
for
a
week
and
during
this
time
a
came
in
from
fort
churchill
the
runner
brought
a
new
experience
into
the
life
of
mélisse
her
first
letter
it
was
from
young
dixon
twenty
or
more
closely
written
pages
of
it
in
which
he
informed
her
that
he
was
going
to
spend
a
part
of
the
approaching
winter
at
lac
bain
she
was
reading
the
last
page
when
jan
came
into
the
cabin
her
cheeks
were
slightly
flushed
by
this
new
excitement
which
was
reflected
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
a
letter
she
cried
holding
out
her
two
hands
filled
with
the
pages
a
letter
to
me
jan
all
the
way
from
fort
churchill
who
in
the
world
he
began
smiling
at
her
and
stopped
it
from
dixon
she
said
the
flush
deepening
in
her
cheeks
he
going
to
spend
part
of
the
winter
with
us
i
glad
of
that
mélisse
said
jan
quietly
i
like
him
and
would
like
to
know
him
better
i
hope
he
will
bring
you
some
more
books
and
strings
he
glanced
at
the
old
violin
do
you
play
much
a
great
deal
she
replied
wo
you
play
for
me
jan
my
hands
are
too
rough
and
besides
i
forgotten
all
that
i
ever
knew
even
the
things
you
played
when
i
was
a
baby
i
think
i
have
mélisse
but
you
must
never
forget
them
i
shall
remember
them
always
she
answered
softly
some
day
it
may
be
that
i
will
teach
them
to
you
again
he
did
not
see
her
again
until
six
months
later
when
he
came
in
to
the
caribou
roast
with
his
furs
then
he
learned
that
another
letter
had
come
to
mélisse
and
that
dixon
had
gone
to
london
instead
of
coming
to
lac
bain
the
day
after
the
carnival
he
went
back
into
the
country
of
the
athabasca
spring
did
not
see
him
at
lac
bain
early
summer
brought
no
news
of
him
in
the
floods
jean
went
by
the
to
the
athabasca
and
found
thoreau
cabin
abandoned
there
had
not
been
life
in
it
for
a
long
time
the
indians
said
that
since
the
melting
snows
they
had
not
seen
a
whom
jean
met
at
fond
du
lac
said
that
he
had
found
the
bones
of
a
white
man
on
the
beaver
with
a
hudson
bay
gun
and
a
knife
beside
them
jean
came
back
to
lac
bain
heavy
at
heart
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
he
is
dead
he
told
iowaka
i
do
not
believe
that
it
will
hurt
very
much
if
you
tell
mélisse
one
day
early
in
september
a
lone
figure
came
in
to
the
post
at
noon
when
the
company
people
were
at
dinner
he
carried
a
pack
and
six
dogs
trailed
at
his
heels
it
was
jan
thoreau
i
have
been
down
to
civilization
was
his
explanation
i
have
returned
to
spend
this
winter
at
lac
bain
chapter
xxiv
the
rescue
on
the
first
snow
came
young
dixon
from
fort
churchill
jean
de
gravois
met
him
on
the
trail
near
ledoq
when
the
englishman
recognized
the
little
frenchman
he
leaped
from
his
sledge
and
advanced
with
outstretched
hand
his
face
lighting
up
with
pleasure
bless
me
if
it
is
my
old
friend
jean
he
cried
i
was
just
thinking
of
you
gravois
and
how
you
trimmed
me
to
a
finish
two
winters
ago
i
learned
a
lot
about
you
people
up
here
in
the
snows
since
then
and
i
never
do
anything
like
that
again
he
laughed
into
jean
face
as
they
shook
hands
and
his
voice
was
filled
with
unbounded
sincerity
how
is
gravois
and
the
little
gravois
and
mélisse
he
added
before
jean
had
spoken
all
well
dixon
replied
jean
only
the
little
gravois
have
almost
grown
into
a
man
and
woman
an
hour
or
so
later
he
said
to
iowaka
i
ca
help
liking
this
man
dixon
and
yet
i
do
want
to
why
is
it
do
you
suppose
is
it
because
you
are
afraid
that
mélisse
will
like
him
asked
his
wife
smiling
over
her
shoulder
blessed
saints
i
believe
that
it
is
said
jean
frankly
i
hate
foreigners
and
mélisse
belongs
to
she
did
once
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
jean
it
may
be
and
yet
i
doubt
it
ma
bien
aimée
if
jan
would
tell
her
a
woman
will
not
wait
always
interrupted
iowaka
softly
jan
thoreau
has
waited
too
long
a
week
later
as
they
stood
together
in
front
of
their
door
they
saw
dixon
and
mélisse
walking
slowly
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
the
woman
laughed
into
jean
face
did
i
not
say
that
jan
had
waited
too
long
jean
face
was
black
with
disapprobation
then
you
would
have
taken
up
with
some
foreigner
if
i
had
remained
in
the
athabasca
country
another
year
or
two
he
demanded
questioningly
very
likely
retorted
iowaka
mischievously
running
into
the
cabin
the
devil
said
jean
sourly
stalking
in
the
direction
of
the
store
he
was
angered
at
the
coolness
with
which
jan
accepted
the
situation
this
dixon
is
with
mélisse
afternoon
and
evening
and
they
walk
together
every
day
in
the
bush
he
said
to
him
soon
there
will
be
a
wedding
at
lac
bain
mélisse
deserves
a
good
man
replied
jan
unmoved
i
like
dixon
deep
down
in
his
soul
he
knew
that
each
day
was
bringing
the
end
of
it
all
much
nearer
for
him
he
did
not
tell
mélisse
that
he
had
returned
to
lac
bain
to
be
near
her
once
more
nor
did
he
confide
in
jean
he
had
anticipated
that
this
winter
at
the
post
would
be
filled
with
a
certain
painful
pleasure
for
him
but
he
had
not
anticipated
dixon
day
after
day
he
saw
mélisse
and
the
englishman
together
and
while
they
awakened
in
him
none
of
the
fiery
jealousy
which
might
have
rankled
in
the
bosom
of
jean
de
gravois
the
knowledge
that
the
girl
was
at
last
passing
from
him
for
ever
added
a
deeper
grief
to
that
which
was
already
eating
at
his
heart
dixon
made
no
effort
to
conceal
his
feelings
he
loved
mélisse
frankly
he
told
this
to
jean
one
day
when
they
were
on
the
churchill
trail
in
his
honest
way
he
said
things
which
broke
down
the
last
of
hereditary
prejudices
and
compelled
him
to
admit
that
this
was
a
different
sort
of
foreigner
than
he
had
ever
known
before
diable
i
like
him
he
said
to
himself
and
yet
i
would
rather
see
him
in
the
blessed
hereafter
than
have
him
take
mélisse
from
jan
the
big
snow
decided
it
came
early
in
december
dixon
had
set
out
alone
for
ledoq
early
in
the
morning
by
noon
the
sky
was
a
leaden
black
and
a
little
later
one
could
not
see
a
dozen
paces
ahead
of
him
for
the
snow
the
englishman
did
not
return
that
day
the
next
day
he
was
still
gone
and
gravois
drove
along
the
top
of
the
mountain
ridge
until
he
came
to
the
frenchman
where
he
found
that
dixon
had
started
for
lac
bain
the
preceding
afternoon
he
brought
word
back
to
the
post
then
he
went
to
mélisse
it
is
as
good
as
death
to
go
out
in
search
of
him
he
said
we
can
no
longer
use
the
dogs
snowshoes
will
sink
like
leaden
bullets
by
morning
and
to
go
ten
miles
from
the
post
means
that
there
will
be
bones
to
be
picked
by
the
foxes
when
the
crust
comes
it
was
dark
when
jan
came
into
the
cabin
mélisse
started
to
her
feet
with
a
little
cry
when
he
entered
covered
white
with
the
snow
a
light
pack
was
strapped
to
his
back
and
he
carried
his
rifle
in
his
hand
i
am
going
to
hunt
for
him
he
said
softly
if
he
is
alive
i
will
bring
him
back
to
you
she
came
to
him
slowly
and
the
beating
of
jan
heart
sounded
to
him
like
the
distant
thrumming
of
ah
would
he
ever
forget
that
look
the
old
glory
was
in
her
eyes
her
arms
were
reaching
out
her
lips
parted
jan
knew
how
the
great
spirit
had
once
appeared
to
mukee
and
how
a
white
mist
like
a
had
come
between
the
eyes
and
the
wondrous
thing
he
beheld
that
same
veil
drifted
between
jan
and
the
girl
as
in
a
vision
he
saw
her
face
so
near
to
him
that
he
felt
the
touch
of
her
sweet
breath
and
he
knew
that
one
of
his
rough
hands
was
clasped
in
both
of
her
own
and
that
after
a
moment
it
was
crushed
tightly
against
her
bosom
jan
my
hero
he
struggled
back
almost
sobbing
as
he
plunged
out
into
the
night
again
he
heard
her
voice
crying
after
him
but
the
wild
wailing
of
the
spruce
and
the
storm
in
his
brain
drowned
its
words
he
had
seen
the
glorious
light
of
love
in
her
eyes
her
love
for
dixon
and
he
would
find
him
at
last
he
jan
thoreau
would
prove
that
the
old
love
was
not
dead
within
him
he
would
do
for
mélisse
this
night
the
next
day
and
until
he
fell
down
to
die
what
he
had
promised
to
do
on
their
to
ledoq
and
then
he
went
to
ledoq
now
following
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
reached
his
cabin
in
the
late
dawn
the
frenchman
stared
at
him
in
amazement
when
he
learned
that
he
was
about
to
set
out
on
a
search
for
dixon
you
will
not
find
him
he
said
slowly
in
french
but
if
you
are
determined
to
go
i
will
hunt
with
you
it
is
a
big
chance
that
we
will
not
come
back
i
do
want
you
to
go
objected
one
will
do
as
much
as
two
unless
we
search
alone
i
came
your
way
to
find
if
it
had
begun
to
snow
before
dixon
left
an
hour
after
he
had
gone
you
could
not
see
your
hand
before
your
face
replied
ledoq
preparing
his
pack
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
he
circled
out
over
lac
bain
we
will
go
that
far
together
and
then
search
alone
they
went
back
over
the
mountain
and
stopped
when
instinct
told
them
that
they
were
opposite
the
spruce
forests
of
the
lake
there
they
separated
jan
going
as
nearly
as
he
could
guess
into
the
northwest
ledoq
trailing
slowly
and
hopelessly
into
the
south
it
was
no
great
sacrifice
for
jan
this
struggle
with
the
big
snows
for
the
happiness
of
mélisse
what
it
was
to
ledoq
no
man
ever
guessed
or
knew
for
it
was
not
until
the
late
spring
snows
had
gone
that
the
people
at
lac
bain
found
what
the
foxes
and
the
wolves
had
left
of
him
far
to
the
south
fearlessly
jan
plunged
into
the
white
world
of
the
lake
there
was
neither
rock
nor
tree
to
guide
him
for
everywhere
was
the
heavy
of
the
indian
god
the
balsams
were
bending
under
it
the
spruces
were
breaking
into
hunchback
forms
the
whole
world
was
twisted
in
noiseless
torture
under
its
increasing
weight
out
through
the
still
terror
of
it
all
jan
voice
went
in
wild
echoing
shouts
now
and
then
he
fired
his
rifle
and
always
he
listened
long
and
intently
the
echoes
came
back
to
him
laughing
taunting
and
then
each
time
fell
the
mirthless
silence
of
the
storm
day
came
only
a
little
lighter
than
the
night
he
crossed
the
lake
his
sinking
at
every
step
and
once
each
he
fired
a
single
shot
from
his
rifle
he
heard
shots
to
the
south
and
knew
that
it
was
ledoq
each
report
coming
to
him
more
faintly
than
the
last
until
they
had
died
away
entirely
across
the
lake
he
struck
the
forest
again
and
his
shouts
echoed
in
futile
inquiry
in
its
weird
depths
about
him
there
was
no
sign
of
life
no
sound
except
the
faint
fluttering
of
falling
snow
under
five
feet
of
this
snow
the
creatures
of
the
wilderness
were
snugly
buried
close
against
the
trunks
of
the
spruces
sheltered
within
their
coverings
the
birds
waited
like
lifeless
things
for
the
breaking
of
the
storm
at
noon
jan
stopped
and
ate
his
lunch
then
he
went
on
carrying
his
rifle
always
upon
his
right
shoulder
so
that
the
steps
of
his
right
leg
would
be
shortened
and
he
would
travel
in
a
circle
as
he
believed
dixon
had
done
the
storm
thickened
with
the
falling
of
night
and
he
burrowed
himself
a
great
hole
in
the
soft
snow
and
filled
it
with
balsam
boughs
for
a
bed
when
he
awakened
hours
later
he
stood
up
and
thrust
out
his
head
and
found
himself
buried
to
the
with
the
aid
of
his
broad
he
drew
himself
out
until
he
stood
in
the
surface
he
lifted
his
pack
as
he
swung
it
before
him
one
arm
thrust
through
a
strap
he
gave
a
startled
cry
half
of
one
side
of
the
pack
was
eaten
away
he
thrust
his
hands
through
the
breach
and
a
moan
of
despair
sobbed
on
his
lips
when
he
found
that
his
food
was
gone
a
thin
trickle
of
flour
ran
through
his
fingers
upon
the
snow
he
pulled
out
a
gnawed
pound
of
bacon
a
little
tea
and
that
was
all
frantically
he
ripped
the
rent
wider
in
his
search
and
when
he
stood
up
his
wild
face
staring
into
the
chaos
about
him
he
held
only
the
bit
of
bacon
in
his
hand
in
it
were
the
imprints
of
tiny
teeth
sharp
little
teeth
that
told
him
what
had
happened
while
he
had
slept
a
mink
had
robbed
him
of
his
food
with
one
of
his
shoes
he
began
digging
furiously
in
the
snow
he
tore
his
balsam
bed
to
pieces
somewhere
somewhere
not
very
far
away
the
little
animal
must
have
cached
its
theft
he
dug
down
until
he
came
to
the
frozen
earth
for
an
hour
he
worked
and
found
nothing
then
he
stopped
over
a
small
fire
he
melted
snow
for
tea
and
broiled
a
slice
of
the
bacon
which
he
ate
with
the
few
biscuit
crumbs
he
found
in
the
pack
every
particle
of
flour
that
he
could
find
he
scraped
up
with
his
knife
and
put
into
one
of
the
deep
pockets
of
his
caribou
coat
after
that
he
set
cut
in
the
direction
in
which
he
thought
he
would
find
lac
bain
still
he
shouted
for
dixon
and
fired
an
occasional
shot
from
his
rifle
by
noon
he
should
have
struck
the
lake
noon
came
and
passed
the
gloom
of
a
second
night
fell
upon
him
he
built
himself
a
fire
and
ate
of
what
remained
of
the
bacon
the
handful
of
flour
in
his
pocket
he
did
not
disturb
it
was
still
night
when
he
broke
his
rest
and
struggled
on
his
first
fears
were
gone
in
place
of
them
there
filled
him
now
a
grim
sort
of
pleasure
a
second
time
he
was
battling
with
death
for
mélisse
and
this
after
all
was
not
a
very
hard
fight
for
him
he
had
feared
death
in
the
red
plague
but
he
did
not
fear
the
thought
of
this
death
that
threatened
him
in
the
big
snows
it
thrilled
him
instead
with
a
strange
sort
of
exhilaration
if
he
died
it
would
be
for
mélisse
and
for
all
time
she
would
remember
him
for
what
he
had
done
when
he
ate
the
last
bit
of
his
bacon
he
made
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
when
the
end
came
in
the
stock
of
his
rifle
he
would
scratch
a
few
last
words
to
mélisse
he
even
arranged
the
words
in
his
brain
four
of
them
mélisse
i
love
you
he
repeated
them
to
himself
as
he
staggered
on
and
that
night
beside
the
fire
he
built
he
began
by
carving
her
name
he
said
softly
i
will
do
the
rest
he
was
growing
very
hungry
but
he
did
not
touch
the
flour
for
six
hours
he
slept
and
then
drank
his
fill
of
hot
tea
we
will
travel
until
day
jan
thoreau
he
informed
himself
and
then
if
nothing
turns
up
we
will
build
our
last
camp
and
eat
the
flour
it
will
be
the
last
of
us
for
there
will
be
no
meat
above
this
snow
for
days
his
were
an
impediment
now
and
he
left
them
behind
along
with
one
of
his
two
blankets
which
had
grown
to
be
like
lead
upon
his
shoulders
he
counted
his
cartridges
ten
of
them
one
of
these
he
fired
into
the
air
was
that
an
echo
he
heard
a
sudden
thrill
shot
through
him
he
strained
his
ears
to
catch
a
repetition
of
the
sound
in
a
moment
it
came
again
clearly
no
echo
this
time
ledoq
he
cried
aloud
he
fired
again
back
to
him
came
the
distant
splitting
crack
of
a
rifle
he
forced
his
way
toward
it
after
a
little
he
heard
the
signal
again
much
nearer
than
before
and
he
fired
in
response
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
on
he
came
to
a
low
mountain
ridge
and
lifted
his
voice
in
a
loud
shout
a
shot
came
from
just
over
the
mountain
waist
deep
in
the
light
snow
he
began
the
ascent
dragging
himself
up
by
the
tops
of
the
slender
saplings
stopping
every
few
yards
to
himself
out
in
the
soft
mass
through
which
he
was
struggling
panting
with
exhaustion
he
shouted
when
he
gained
the
top
of
the
ridge
up
through
the
white
blur
of
snow
on
the
other
side
there
came
to
him
faintly
a
shout
yet
in
spite
of
its
faintness
jan
knew
that
it
was
very
near
something
has
happened
to
ledoq
he
told
himself
but
he
surely
has
food
and
we
can
live
it
out
until
the
storm
is
over
it
was
easier
going
down
the
ridge
and
he
went
quickly
in
the
direction
from
which
the
voice
had
come
until
a
mass
of
huge
boulders
loomed
up
before
him
there
was
a
faint
odor
of
smoke
in
the
air
and
he
followed
it
in
among
the
rocks
where
it
grew
stronger
ho
ledoq
he
shouted
a
voice
replied
a
dozen
yards
away
slowly
as
he
advanced
he
made
out
the
dim
shadow
of
life
in
the
white
gloom
a
bit
of
smoke
climbing
weakly
in
the
storm
the
black
opening
of
a
brush
shelter
and
then
between
the
opening
and
the
spiral
of
smoke
a
living
thing
that
came
creeping
toward
him
on
all
fours
like
an
animal
he
plunged
toward
it
and
the
shadow
staggered
upward
and
would
have
fallen
had
it
not
been
for
the
support
of
the
deep
snow
another
step
and
a
sharp
cry
fell
from
jan
lips
it
was
not
ledoq
but
dixon
who
stood
there
with
white
starved
face
and
staring
eyes
in
the
snow
gloom
my
god
i
am
starving
and
dying
for
a
drink
of
water
gasped
the
englishman
chokingly
thrusting
out
his
arms
thoreau
god
be
praised
he
staggered
and
fell
in
the
snow
jan
dragged
him
back
to
the
shelter
i
will
have
water
for
you
and
something
to
eat
very
soon
he
said
his
voice
sounded
unreal
there
was
a
mistiness
before
his
eyes
which
was
not
caused
by
the
storm
a
twisting
of
strange
shadows
that
bothered
his
vision
and
made
him
sway
dizzily
when
he
threw
off
his
pack
to
stir
the
fire
he
suspended
his
two
small
pails
over
the
embers
which
he
coaxed
into
a
blaze
both
he
filled
with
snow
into
one
he
emptied
the
handful
of
flour
that
he
had
carried
in
his
pocket
into
the
other
he
put
tea
fifteen
minutes
later
he
carried
them
to
the
englishman
dixon
sat
up
a
glazed
passion
filling
his
eyes
he
drank
the
hot
tea
greedily
and
as
greedily
ate
the
boiled
jan
watched
him
hungrily
until
the
last
crumb
of
it
was
gone
he
refilled
the
pails
with
snow
added
more
tea
and
then
rejoined
the
englishman
new
life
was
already
shining
in
dixon
eyes
not
a
moment
too
soon
thoreau
he
said
thankfully
reaching
over
to
grip
the
other
hand
another
night
and
suddenly
he
stopped
great
heaven
what
is
the
matter
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
pinched
torture
in
his
face
jan
head
dropped
weakly
upon
his
breast
his
hands
were
icy
cold
nothing
he
murmured
drowsily
only
i
starving
too
dixon
he
recovered
himself
with
an
effort
and
smiled
into
dixon
startled
face
there
is
nothing
to
eat
he
continued
as
he
saw
the
other
direct
his
gaze
toward
the
pack
i
gave
you
the
last
of
the
flour
there
is
nothing
but
salt
and
tea
he
rolled
over
upon
the
balsam
boughs
with
a
restful
sigh
let
me
sleep
dixon
went
to
the
pack
one
by
one
in
his
search
for
food
he
took
out
the
few
articles
that
it
contained
after
that
he
drank
more
tea
crawled
back
into
the
balsam
shelter
and
lay
down
beside
jan
it
was
broad
day
when
he
awoke
and
he
called
hoarsely
to
his
companion
when
he
saw
that
the
snow
had
ceased
falling
jan
did
not
stir
for
a
moment
dixon
leaned
over
to
listen
to
his
breathing
and
then
dragged
himself
slowly
and
painfully
out
into
the
day
the
fire
was
out
a
leaden
blackness
still
filled
the
sky
deep
silent
gloom
hung
in
the
wake
of
the
storm
suddenly
there
came
to
dixon
ears
a
sound
it
was
a
sound
that
would
have
been
unheard
in
the
gentle
whispering
of
a
wind
in
the
swaying
of
the
but
in
this
silence
it
fell
upon
the
starving
hearing
with
a
distinctness
that
drew
his
muscles
rigid
and
set
his
eyes
staring
about
him
in
wild
search
just
beyond
the
hanging
pails
a
hopped
out
upon
the
snow
it
chirped
hungrily
its
big
eyes
scrutinizing
dixon
the
man
stared
back
fearing
to
move
slowly
he
forced
his
right
foot
through
the
snow
to
the
rear
of
his
left
and
as
cautiously
brought
his
left
behind
his
right
working
himself
backward
step
by
step
until
he
reached
the
shelter
just
inside
was
his
rifle
he
drew
it
out
and
sank
upon
his
knees
in
the
snow
to
aim
at
the
report
of
the
rifle
jan
stirred
but
did
not
open
his
eyes
he
made
no
movement
when
dixon
called
out
in
shrill
joy
that
he
had
killed
meat
he
heard
he
strove
to
arouse
himself
but
something
more
powerful
than
his
own
will
seemed
pulling
him
down
into
oblivion
it
seemed
an
eternity
before
he
was
conscious
of
a
voice
again
he
felt
himself
lifted
and
opened
his
eyes
with
his
head
resting
against
the
englishman
shoulder
drink
this
thoreau
he
heard
he
drank
and
knew
that
it
was
not
tea
that
ran
down
his
throat
soup
he
heard
again
how
is
it
he
became
dixon
was
offering
him
a
dozen
small
bits
of
meat
on
a
tin
plate
and
he
ate
without
questioning
suddenly
when
there
were
only
two
or
three
of
the
smallest
scraps
left
he
stopped
mon
dieu
it
was
he
cried
i
have
eaten
it
all
the
young
englishman
white
face
grinned
at
him
i
got
the
flour
inside
of
me
thoreau
you
got
the
is
that
fair
the
plate
dropped
between
them
over
it
their
hands
met
in
a
great
clutching
grip
and
up
from
jan
heart
there
welled
words
which
almost
burst
from
his
lips
in
voice
words
which
rang
in
his
brain
and
which
were
an
unspoken
prayer
mélisse
i
thank
the
great
god
that
it
is
this
man
whom
you
love
but
it
was
in
silence
that
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
went
out
into
the
gloom
this
may
be
only
a
lull
in
the
storm
he
said
we
must
lose
no
time
how
long
did
you
travel
before
you
made
this
camp
about
ten
hours
said
dixon
i
made
due
west
by
compass
until
i
knew
that
i
had
passed
lac
bain
and
then
struck
north
ah
you
have
the
compass
cried
jan
his
eyes
lighting
up
dixon
we
are
very
near
to
the
post
if
you
camped
so
soon
tell
me
which
is
north
that
is
north
then
we
go
south
south
and
east
if
you
traveled
ten
hours
first
west
and
then
north
we
are
northwest
of
lac
bain
jan
spoke
no
more
but
got
his
rifle
from
the
shelter
and
put
only
the
tea
and
two
pails
in
his
pack
leaving
the
remaining
blanket
upon
the
snow
the
englishman
followed
close
behind
him
bending
weakly
under
the
weight
of
his
gun
tediously
they
struggled
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
and
as
jan
stopped
to
look
through
the
gray
day
about
him
dixon
sank
down
into
the
snow
when
the
other
turned
toward
him
he
grinned
up
feebly
into
his
face
bushed
he
gasped
do
believe
i
can
make
it
through
this
snow
thoreau
there
was
no
fear
in
his
eyes
there
was
even
a
cheerful
ring
in
his
voice
a
sudden
glow
leaped
into
jan
face
i
know
this
ridge
he
exclaimed
it
runs
within
a
mile
of
lac
bain
you
better
leave
your
rifle
behind
dixon
made
an
effort
to
rise
and
jan
helped
him
they
went
on
slowly
resting
every
few
hundred
yards
and
each
time
that
he
rose
from
these
periods
of
rest
dixon
face
was
twisted
with
pain
it
the
flour
and
water
anchored
amidships
he
smiled
grimly
cramps
ugh
we
make
it
by
assured
jan
cheerfully
dixon
leaned
heavily
on
his
arm
i
wish
you
go
on
alone
he
urged
you
could
send
help
i
promised
mélisse
that
i
would
bring
you
back
if
i
found
you
replied
jan
his
face
turned
away
if
the
storm
broke
again
you
would
be
lost
tell
me
tell
me
he
heard
dixon
pant
eagerly
did
she
send
you
to
hunt
for
me
thoreau
something
in
the
englishman
voice
drew
his
eyes
to
him
there
was
an
excited
flush
in
his
starved
cheeks
his
eyes
shone
did
she
send
you
jan
struggled
hard
to
speak
calmly
not
in
words
dixon
but
i
know
that
if
i
get
you
safely
back
to
lac
bain
she
will
be
very
happy
something
came
in
dixon
sobbing
breath
which
jan
did
not
hear
a
little
later
he
stopped
and
built
a
fire
over
which
he
melted
more
snow
and
boiled
tea
the
drink
stimulated
them
and
they
went
on
a
little
later
still
and
jan
hung
his
rifle
in
the
crotch
of
a
sapling
we
will
return
for
the
guns
in
a
day
or
so
he
said
dixon
leaned
upon
him
more
heavily
now
and
the
distances
they
traveled
between
resting
periods
became
shorter
and
shorter
three
times
they
stopped
to
build
fires
and
cook
tea
it
was
night
when
they
descended
from
the
ridge
to
the
ice
of
lac
bain
it
was
past
midnight
when
jan
dragged
dixon
from
the
spruce
forest
into
the
opening
at
the
post
there
were
no
lights
burning
and
he
went
with
his
burden
to
the
company
store
he
awakened
croisset
who
let
them
in
take
care
of
dixon
said
jan
and
do
arouse
any
of
the
people
it
will
be
time
enough
to
tell
what
has
happened
in
the
morning
over
the
stove
in
his
own
room
he
cooked
meat
and
coffee
and
for
a
long
time
sat
silent
before
the
fire
he
had
brought
back
dixon
in
the
morning
mélisse
would
know
first
she
would
go
to
the
englishman
then
then
she
would
come
to
him
he
rose
and
went
to
the
rude
board
table
in
the
corner
of
his
room
no
mélisse
must
not
come
to
me
in
the
morning
he
whispered
to
himself
she
must
never
again
look
upon
jan
thoreau
he
took
pencil
and
paper
and
wrote
page
after
page
he
crumpled
in
his
hand
and
flung
into
the
fire
at
last
swiftly
and
despairingly
he
ended
with
half
a
dozen
lines
what
he
said
came
from
his
heart
in
french
i
have
brought
him
back
to
you
my
mélisse
and
pray
that
the
good
god
may
give
you
happiness
i
leave
you
the
old
violin
and
always
when
you
play
it
will
tell
you
of
the
love
of
jan
thoreau
he
folded
the
page
and
sealed
it
in
one
of
the
company
envelopes
very
quietly
he
went
from
his
room
down
into
the
deserted
store
without
striking
a
light
he
found
a
new
pack
a
few
articles
of
food
and
ammunition
the
envelope
addressed
to
mélisse
he
left
where
croisset
or
the
factor
would
find
it
in
the
morning
his
dogs
were
housed
in
a
shack
behind
the
store
and
he
called
out
their
names
softly
and
warningly
as
he
went
among
them
as
stealthily
as
their
master
they
trailed
behind
him
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
close
under
the
old
spruce
that
guarded
the
grave
jan
stopped
and
silently
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
the
little
cabin
the
dogs
watched
him
kazan
the
leader
glared
from
him
into
the
dimness
of
the
night
whining
softly
a
low
mourning
wind
swept
through
the
spruce
tops
and
from
jan
throat
there
burst
sobbingly
words
which
he
had
heard
beside
this
same
grave
more
than
seventeen
years
before
when
williams
choking
voice
had
risen
in
a
last
prayer
for
the
woman
may
the
great
god
care
for
mélisse
he
turned
into
the
trail
upon
which
jean
de
gravois
had
fought
the
englishman
led
his
dogs
and
sledge
in
a
twisting
path
through
the
caribou
swamp
and
stood
at
last
beside
the
tree
that
leaned
out
over
the
edge
of
the
white
barrens
with
his
knife
he
dug
out
the
papers
which
he
had
concealed
in
that
hole
it
was
near
dawn
when
he
recovered
the
rifle
which
he
had
abandoned
on
the
mountain
top
a
little
later
it
began
to
snow
he
was
glad
for
it
would
conceal
his
trail
for
thirteen
days
he
forced
his
dogs
through
the
deep
snows
into
the
south
on
the
fourteenth
they
came
to
le
pas
which
is
the
edge
of
civilization
it
was
night
when
he
came
out
of
the
forest
so
that
he
could
see
the
faint
glow
of
lights
beyond
the
saskatchewan
for
a
few
moments
before
crossing
he
stopped
his
tired
dogs
and
turned
his
face
back
into
the
grim
desolation
of
the
north
where
the
aurora
was
playing
feebly
in
the
skies
and
beckoning
to
him
and
telling
him
that
the
old
life
of
centuries
and
centuries
ago
would
wait
for
him
always
at
the
dome
of
the
earth
the
good
god
bless
you
and
keep
you
and
care
for
you
ever
more
my
mélisse
he
whispered
and
he
walked
slowly
ahead
of
his
dogs
across
the
river
and
into
the
other
world
chapter
xxv
jack
thornton
there
was
music
that
night
in
le
pas
jan
heard
it
before
he
came
to
the
first
of
the
scattered
lights
and
the
dogs
pricked
up
their
ears
kazan
the
whined
under
his
breath
and
the
weight
at
heart
grew
heavier
as
the
dog
turned
up
his
head
to
him
in
the
starlight
it
was
strange
music
nothing
like
jan
had
ever
heard
it
was
strange
to
kazan
and
set
him
whining
and
he
thrust
his
muzzle
up
to
his
master
touch
inquiringly
they
passed
on
like
shadows
close
to
a
big
lighted
log
building
from
which
the
music
came
and
with
it
a
tumult
of
laughter
of
shuffling
and
stamping
feet
of
coarse
singing
and
loud
voices
a
door
opened
and
a
man
and
a
woman
came
out
the
man
was
cursing
and
the
woman
was
laughing
at
him
laughing
as
jan
had
never
heard
a
woman
laugh
before
and
he
held
his
breath
as
he
listened
to
the
taunting
mockery
in
it
others
followed
the
first
man
and
the
first
woman
some
passed
quietly
a
woman
escorted
between
two
men
screamed
with
merriment
as
she
flung
toward
his
shadowy
figure
an
object
which
fell
with
a
crash
against
the
sledge
it
was
a
bottle
kazan
snarled
the
slunk
close
to
the
leader
heels
with
a
low
word
jan
led
them
on
close
down
to
the
river
where
the
saskatchewan
swung
in
a
to
the
south
and
west
he
found
a
low
squat
building
with
a
light
hung
over
the
door
illuminating
a
bit
of
humor
in
the
form
of
a
printed
legend
which
said
that
it
was
king
edward
hotel
the
scrub
bush
of
the
forest
grew
within
a
hundred
yards
of
it
and
in
this
bush
jan
tied
his
dogs
and
left
his
sledge
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
now
when
he
had
entered
civilization
he
had
come
also
into
the
land
of
lock
and
bolt
of
robbers
and
thieves
it
was
loneliness
and
not
suspicion
that
sent
him
back
to
unleash
kazan
and
take
him
with
him
they
entered
the
hotel
kazan
with
suspicious
caution
the
door
opened
into
a
big
room
lighted
by
an
oil
lamp
turned
low
the
room
was
empty
except
for
a
solitary
figure
sitting
in
a
chair
facing
a
wide
window
which
looked
into
the
north
making
no
sound
that
he
might
not
disturb
this
other
occupant
jan
also
seated
himself
before
the
window
kazan
laid
his
wolfish
head
across
his
master
knees
his
one
eye
upon
him
steadily
and
questioningly
never
in
all
his
years
of
life
had
jan
felt
the
depth
of
loneliness
that
swept
upon
him
now
as
he
looked
into
the
north
below
him
the
saskatchewan
lay
white
and
silent
beyond
it
he
could
see
the
dark
edge
of
the
forest
and
far
far
beyond
that
hovering
low
in
the
sky
the
polar
star
it
burned
faintly
now
almost
like
a
thousand
other
stars
that
he
saw
and
the
aurora
was
only
a
fading
glow
something
rose
up
in
jan
throat
and
choked
him
and
he
closed
his
eyes
with
his
fingers
clutching
kazan
head
in
spite
of
the
battle
that
he
had
fought
his
mind
swept
back
back
through
the
endless
silent
spaces
over
mountains
and
through
forests
swift
resistless
until
once
more
the
polar
star
flashed
in
all
its
glory
over
his
head
and
he
was
at
lac
bain
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
surrendering
to
hunger
exhaustion
the
cumulative
effects
of
his
thirteen
days
fight
in
the
forests
he
was
with
mélisse
again
with
the
old
violin
with
the
things
that
they
had
loved
he
forgot
in
these
moments
that
there
was
another
in
the
room
he
heard
no
sound
as
the
man
shifted
his
position
so
that
he
looked
steadily
at
him
and
kazan
it
was
the
low
sob
of
grief
that
fell
from
his
own
lips
that
awakened
him
again
to
a
consciousness
of
the
present
he
jerked
himself
erect
and
found
kazan
with
his
fangs
gleaming
the
stranger
had
risen
he
was
standing
close
to
him
leaning
down
staring
at
him
in
the
dim
lamplight
and
as
jan
lifted
his
own
eyes
he
knew
that
in
the
pale
eager
face
of
the
man
above
him
there
was
written
a
grief
which
might
have
been
a
reflection
of
his
own
for
a
full
breath
or
two
they
looked
neither
speaking
and
the
hair
along
kazan
spine
stood
stiff
something
reached
out
to
jan
and
set
his
tired
blood
tingling
he
knew
that
this
man
was
not
a
forest
man
he
was
not
of
his
people
his
face
bore
the
stamp
of
the
people
to
the
south
of
civilization
and
yet
something
passed
between
them
leaped
all
barriers
and
made
them
friends
before
they
had
spoken
the
stranger
reached
down
his
hand
and
jan
reached
up
his
all
of
the
loneliness
the
clinging
to
hope
the
starving
desire
of
two
men
for
companionship
passed
in
the
long
grip
of
their
hands
you
have
just
come
down
said
the
man
half
questioningly
that
was
your
sledge
out
there
yes
said
jan
the
stranger
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
from
the
camps
he
questioned
eagerly
what
camps
the
railroad
camps
where
they
are
putting
the
new
line
through
beyond
wekusko
i
know
of
no
camps
said
jan
simply
i
know
of
no
railroad
except
this
that
comes
to
le
pas
i
come
from
lac
bain
on
the
edge
of
the
barren
lands
you
have
never
been
down
before
asked
the
stranger
softly
jan
wondered
at
the
light
in
his
eyes
a
long
time
ago
he
said
for
a
day
i
have
passed
all
of
my
life
up
there
jan
pointed
to
the
north
and
the
other
eyes
turned
to
where
the
polar
star
was
fading
low
in
the
sky
and
i
have
passed
all
of
my
life
down
there
he
replied
nodding
his
head
to
the
south
a
year
ago
i
came
up
here
for
for
health
and
happiness
he
laughed
nervously
i
found
them
both
but
i
leaving
them
i
going
back
my
name
is
thornton
he
added
holding
out
his
hand
again
i
come
from
chicago
my
name
is
thoreau
jan
thoreau
said
i
have
read
of
chicago
in
a
book
and
have
seen
pictures
of
it
is
it
larger
than
the
city
that
is
called
winnipeg
he
looked
at
thornton
and
thornton
turned
his
head
a
little
so
that
the
light
did
not
shine
in
his
face
the
grip
of
his
fingers
tightened
about
jan
hand
yes
it
is
larger
the
officers
of
the
great
company
are
at
winnipeg
and
le
commissionaire
are
they
not
of
the
hudson
bay
company
yes
and
if
there
was
business
to
do
important
business
would
it
not
be
best
to
go
to
le
commissionaire
questioned
thornton
looked
hard
at
the
tense
eagerness
in
jan
face
there
are
nearer
headquarters
at
prince
albert
he
said
that
is
not
far
exclaimed
jan
rising
and
they
would
do
business
there
important
business
he
dropped
his
hand
to
kazan
head
and
half
turned
toward
the
door
perhaps
better
than
the
commissioner
replied
thornton
it
might
depend
on
what
your
business
is
to
them
as
each
stood
for
a
moment
in
silence
there
came
the
low
wailing
of
a
dog
out
in
the
night
they
are
calling
for
kazan
said
jan
quietly
as
though
he
had
not
read
the
question
in
thornton
last
words
good
night
the
dogs
were
sitting
upon
their
haunches
waiting
when
jan
and
kazan
went
back
to
them
jan
drew
them
farther
back
where
the
thick
spruce
shut
them
out
from
the
clearing
and
built
a
fire
over
this
he
hung
his
and
a
big
chunk
of
frozen
caribou
meat
and
tossed
frozen
fish
to
the
hungry
dogs
then
he
pulled
down
spruce
boughs
and
spread
his
heavy
blankets
out
near
the
fire
and
waited
for
the
coffee
and
meat
to
cook
the
huskies
were
through
when
he
began
eating
and
they
lay
on
their
bellies
close
about
his
feet
ready
to
snap
at
the
scraps
which
he
threw
them
jan
noticed
as
he
ate
that
there
was
left
in
them
none
of
the
old
fierce
fighting
spirit
they
did
not
snap
or
snarl
there
was
no
quarreling
when
he
threw
bits
of
meat
to
them
and
he
found
himself
wondering
if
they
too
were
filled
with
the
sickness
which
was
eating
at
his
own
heart
with
this
sickness
this
deathly
feeling
of
loneliness
and
heartache
there
had
entered
into
jan
now
a
strange
sensation
that
was
almost
excitement
an
eagerness
to
fasten
the
dogs
in
their
traces
to
hurry
on
in
spite
of
his
exhaustion
to
that
place
which
thornton
had
told
him
of
prince
albert
and
to
free
himself
there
for
all
time
of
the
thing
which
had
oppressed
him
since
that
night
many
years
ago
when
he
had
staggered
into
lac
bain
to
play
his
violin
as
cummins
wife
died
he
reached
inside
his
skin
coat
and
there
he
felt
papers
which
he
had
taken
from
the
hole
in
the
tree
they
were
safe
for
twenty
years
he
had
guarded
them
he
would
take
them
to
the
great
company
at
prince
albert
and
after
that
after
he
had
done
this
thing
what
would
there
remain
in
life
for
jan
thoreau
perhaps
the
company
might
take
him
and
he
would
remain
in
civilization
that
would
be
best
for
him
he
would
fight
against
the
call
of
his
forests
as
years
and
years
ago
he
had
fought
against
that
call
of
the
other
world
that
had
filled
him
with
unrest
for
a
time
he
had
killed
that
if
he
did
return
to
his
forests
he
would
go
far
to
the
west
or
far
to
the
east
no
one
that
had
ever
known
him
would
hear
again
of
jan
thoreau
kazan
had
crept
to
his
blanket
daring
to
encroach
upon
it
inch
by
inch
until
his
great
lay
upon
jan
arm
it
was
ten
years
ago
that
jan
had
taken
kazan
a
little
puppy
that
he
and
mélisse
had
chosen
from
a
litter
of
half
a
dozen
stronger
brothers
and
sisters
kazan
was
all
that
was
left
to
him
now
he
loved
the
other
dogs
but
they
were
not
like
kazan
he
tightened
his
arm
about
the
dog
head
exhaustion
and
the
warmth
of
the
fire
made
him
drowsy
and
after
a
time
he
slept
with
his
head
thrown
back
against
the
tree
something
awoke
him
hours
afterward
he
opened
his
eyes
and
found
that
the
fire
was
still
burning
brightly
on
the
far
side
of
it
beyond
the
dogs
sat
thornton
a
look
at
the
sky
where
the
stars
were
dying
and
jan
knew
that
it
was
just
before
the
gray
break
of
dawn
he
sat
upright
thornton
laughed
softly
at
him
and
puffed
out
clouds
of
smoke
from
his
pipe
you
were
freezing
he
said
as
jan
stared
and
sleeping
like
a
dead
man
i
waited
for
you
back
there
and
then
hunted
you
up
you
know
i
thought
he
hesitated
and
knocked
the
ash
from
his
pipe
bowl
then
he
looked
frankly
and
squarely
at
see
here
old
man
if
hard
up
had
trouble
of
any
sort
bad
luck
got
no
money
wo
you
let
me
help
you
out
thank
you
i
have
money
said
i
prefer
to
sleep
outside
with
the
dogs
mon
dieu
i
guess
i
would
have
been
stiff
with
the
frost
if
you
had
not
come
you
have
been
here
all
night
thornton
nodded
and
it
is
morning
exclaimed
jan
rising
and
looking
above
the
spruce
tops
you
are
kind
i
wish
i
might
do
as
much
for
you
you
can
said
thornton
quietly
where
are
you
going
from
here
to
the
company
offices
at
prince
albert
we
will
start
within
an
hour
will
you
take
me
with
you
thornton
asked
with
pleasure
cried
but
it
will
be
a
hard
journey
i
must
hurry
and
you
may
not
be
accustomed
to
running
behind
the
dogs
thornton
rose
and
stretched
out
a
hand
it
ca
be
too
hard
for
me
he
said
i
wish
he
stopped
and
something
in
his
low
voice
made
jan
look
straight
into
his
eyes
for
a
moment
they
gazed
at
each
other
in
silence
and
again
jan
saw
in
thornton
face
the
look
of
loneliness
and
grief
which
he
had
first
seen
in
the
half
gloom
of
the
hotel
it
was
the
suppressed
note
in
thornton
voice
of
despair
almost
that
struck
him
deepest
and
made
him
hold
the
other
hand
a
moment
longer
then
he
turned
to
his
pack
upon
the
sledge
i
got
meat
and
coffee
and
hard
biscuits
he
said
will
you
have
breakfast
with
me
that
day
jan
and
thornton
made
fifty
miles
westward
over
the
level
surface
of
the
saskeram
and
camped
again
on
the
saskatchewan
the
second
day
they
followed
the
river
passed
the
sipanock
and
struck
south
and
west
over
the
ice
for
prince
albert
it
was
early
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
when
at
last
they
came
to
the
town
we
will
go
to
the
offices
of
the
great
company
said
we
will
lose
no
time
it
was
thornton
now
who
guided
him
to
the
building
at
the
west
edge
of
the
town
it
was
thornton
who
led
him
into
an
office
filled
mostly
with
young
women
who
were
laboring
at
clicking
machines
and
it
was
thornton
who
presented
a
square
bit
of
white
card
to
a
man
at
a
desk
who
after
reading
it
rose
from
his
chair
bowed
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
a
few
moments
later
a
door
opened
and
jan
thoreau
alone
passed
through
it
his
heart
quivering
his
breath
choking
him
his
hand
clutching
at
the
papers
in
his
breast
pocket
outside
thornton
waited
an
hour
passed
and
still
the
door
did
not
reopen
the
man
at
the
desk
glanced
curiously
at
thornton
two
girls
at
typewriters
exchanged
whispered
opinions
as
to
who
might
be
this
creature
from
the
north
who
was
taking
up
an
hour
of
the
time
nearly
two
hours
passed
before
jan
appeared
thornton
still
patient
rose
as
the
door
opened
his
eyes
first
encountered
the
staring
face
of
the
then
jan
came
out
he
had
aged
five
years
in
two
hours
there
was
a
tired
stoop
to
his
shoulders
a
strange
pallor
in
his
cheeks
to
thornton
his
thin
face
seemed
to
have
grown
thinner
with
bowed
head
looking
nowhere
but
ahead
of
him
jan
passed
on
and
as
the
last
door
opened
to
let
them
out
into
the
pale
winter
sun
thornton
heard
the
muffled
sobbing
of
his
breath
his
fingers
gripped
jan
arm
his
eyes
were
blazing
if
you
getting
the
wrong
end
of
anything
up
there
he
cried
fiercely
if
you
in
trouble
and
they
taking
the
blood
out
of
you
tell
me
and
i
put
the
clamps
on
so
me
god
buck
the
devil
when
they
buck
jack
thornton
and
if
it
needs
money
to
show
so
i
got
half
a
million
to
teach
the
game
thanks
struggled
jan
striving
to
keep
a
lump
out
of
his
throat
it
nothing
like
that
i
do
need
money
half
a
million
would
just
about
buy
what
i
given
away
up
there
he
clutched
his
hand
for
an
instant
to
the
empty
pocket
where
the
papers
had
been
chapter
xxvi
temptation
that
night
leaving
thornton
still
at
supper
in
the
little
old
windsor
hotel
jan
slipped
away
and
with
kazan
at
his
heels
crossed
the
frozen
saskatchewan
to
the
spruce
forest
on
the
north
shore
he
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
to
fight
with
himself
against
a
desire
which
was
almost
overpowering
him
once
long
ago
he
had
laid
his
soul
bare
to
jean
de
gravois
and
jean
had
given
him
comfort
he
longed
to
go
to
thornton
as
he
had
gone
to
jean
and
to
tell
him
the
same
story
and
what
had
passed
that
day
in
the
office
of
the
in
his
heart
there
had
grown
something
for
thornton
that
was
stronger
than
friendship
something
that
would
have
made
him
fight
for
him
and
die
for
him
as
he
would
have
fought
and
died
for
jean
de
gravois
it
was
a
feeling
cemented
by
a
belief
that
something
was
troubling
thornton
that
he
too
was
filled
with
a
loneliness
and
a
grief
which
he
was
trying
to
conceal
and
yet
he
fought
to
restrain
himself
from
confiding
in
his
new
friend
it
would
do
no
good
he
knew
except
by
relieving
him
of
a
part
of
his
mental
burden
he
walked
along
the
shore
of
the
river
and
recrossed
it
again
near
the
company
offices
all
were
dark
with
the
exception
of
the
room
in
that
there
glowed
a
light
the
was
keeping
his
promise
he
was
working
he
worked
until
late
for
jan
came
back
two
hours
after
and
saw
the
light
still
there
a
week
it
might
be
ten
days
the
had
told
him
and
it
would
be
over
always
something
in
the
north
drew
jan
eyes
and
he
looked
there
now
wondering
what
would
happen
to
him
after
that
week
was
over
lights
were
out
and
people
were
in
bed
when
he
and
kazan
returned
to
the
hotel
but
thornton
was
up
sitting
by
himself
in
the
gloom
as
jan
had
first
seen
him
at
le
pas
jan
sat
down
beside
him
there
was
an
uneasy
tremor
in
thornton
voice
when
he
said
jan
did
you
ever
love
a
woman
love
her
until
you
were
ready
and
willing
to
die
for
her
the
suddenness
of
the
question
wrung
the
truth
from
jan
lips
in
a
low
choking
voice
for
an
instant
he
thought
that
thornton
must
have
guessed
his
secret
yes
thornton
leaned
toward
him
gripping
his
knees
and
the
misery
in
his
face
was
deeper
than
jan
had
ever
seen
it
before
i
love
a
woman
like
that
he
went
on
tensely
a
girl
not
a
woman
and
she
is
one
of
your
people
jan
of
the
north
as
innocent
as
a
flower
more
beautiful
to
me
than
than
all
the
women
i
have
ever
seen
before
she
is
at
oxford
house
i
am
going
home
to
to
save
myself
save
yourself
cried
mon
dieu
does
she
not
love
you
she
would
follow
me
to
the
end
of
the
earth
then
thornton
straightened
himself
and
wiped
his
pale
face
suddenly
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
motioned
for
jan
to
follow
him
he
walked
swiftly
out
into
the
night
and
still
faster
after
that
until
they
passed
beyond
the
town
from
where
he
stopped
they
could
look
over
the
forests
far
into
the
pale
light
of
the
south
that
hell
for
me
said
thornton
pointing
it
what
we
call
civilization
but
it
mostly
hell
and
it
all
hell
for
me
it
a
hell
of
big
cities
of
strife
of
of
wickedness
i
never
knew
how
great
a
hell
it
was
until
i
came
up
here
among
you
i
wish
to
god
i
could
stay
always
you
love
her
breathed
you
can
stay
i
ca
groaned
thornton
i
ca
unless
what
unless
i
lose
everything
but
her
jan
fingers
trembled
as
they
sought
thornton
hand
and
everything
is
is
nothing
when
you
give
it
for
love
and
happiness
he
urged
the
great
god
i
know
everything
cried
thornton
do
you
understand
i
said
everything
he
turned
almost
fiercely
upon
his
companion
i
give
up
my
name
for
her
i
bury
myself
back
there
in
the
forests
and
never
go
out
of
them
for
her
i
give
up
fortune
friends
lose
myself
for
ever
for
her
but
i
ca
good
god
do
you
understand
jan
stared
his
eyes
grew
large
and
dark
i
spent
ten
years
of
worse
than
hell
down
there
with
a
woman
went
on
thornton
it
happens
among
us
frequently
this
sort
of
hell
i
came
up
here
to
get
out
of
it
for
a
time
you
know
now
there
is
a
woman
down
there
who
who
is
my
wife
she
would
be
glad
if
i
never
returned
she
is
happy
now
when
i
am
away
and
i
have
been
happy
for
a
time
i
know
what
love
is
i
have
felt
it
i
have
lived
it
god
forgive
me
but
i
am
almost
tempted
to
go
back
to
her
he
stopped
at
the
change
which
had
come
in
jan
who
stood
as
straight
and
as
still
as
the
blank
spruce
behind
them
with
only
his
eyes
showing
that
there
was
life
in
him
those
eyes
held
thornton
they
burned
upon
him
through
the
gray
gloom
as
he
had
never
seen
human
eyes
burn
before
he
waited
half
startled
and
jan
spoke
in
his
voice
there
was
nothing
of
that
which
thornton
saw
in
his
eyes
it
was
low
and
soft
and
though
it
had
that
which
rung
like
steel
thornton
could
not
have
understood
or
feared
it
more
how
far
have
you
gone
with
her
thornton
understood
and
advanced
with
his
hands
reaching
out
to
only
as
far
as
one
might
go
with
the
purest
thing
on
earth
he
said
i
have
sinned
in
loving
her
and
in
letting
her
love
me
but
that
is
all
jan
thoreau
i
swear
that
is
all
and
you
are
going
back
into
the
south
yes
i
am
going
back
into
the
south
the
next
day
thornton
did
not
go
he
made
no
sign
of
going
on
the
second
day
so
it
was
with
the
third
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
on
each
of
these
days
jan
went
once
in
the
afternoon
to
the
office
of
the
and
thornton
always
accompanied
him
at
times
when
jan
was
not
looking
there
was
a
hungry
light
in
his
eyes
as
he
followed
the
other
movements
and
once
or
twice
jan
caught
what
was
left
of
this
look
when
he
turned
unexpectedly
he
knew
what
was
in
thornton
mind
and
he
pitied
him
grieved
with
him
in
his
own
heart
until
his
own
secret
almost
wrung
itself
from
his
lips
somehow
in
a
way
that
he
could
not
understand
thornton
sacrifice
to
honor
and
his
despair
gave
jan
strength
and
a
hundred
times
he
asked
himself
if
a
confession
of
his
own
misery
would
do
as
much
for
the
other
he
repeated
this
thought
to
himself
again
and
again
on
the
afternoon
of
the
ninth
day
when
he
went
to
the
office
alone
this
time
thornton
had
remained
behind
he
had
left
him
in
a
gloomy
corner
of
the
hotel
room
from
which
he
had
not
looked
up
when
jan
went
out
with
kazan
this
ninth
day
was
the
last
day
for
jan
thoreau
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
he
listened
as
the
told
him
that
the
work
was
ended
they
shook
hands
it
was
dark
when
jan
came
out
from
the
offices
dark
with
a
pale
gloom
through
which
the
stars
were
beginning
to
glow
with
a
ghostly
gloom
lightened
still
more
in
the
north
with
the
rising
fires
of
the
northern
lights
alone
jan
stood
for
a
few
moments
close
down
to
the
river
across
from
him
was
the
forest
silent
black
reaching
to
the
end
of
the
earth
and
over
it
like
a
signal
light
beckoning
him
back
to
his
world
the
aurora
sent
out
its
shafts
of
red
and
gold
and
as
he
listened
there
came
to
him
faintly
a
distant
wailing
sound
that
he
knew
was
the
voice
from
that
world
and
at
the
sound
the
hair
rose
along
kazan
spine
and
he
whined
deep
down
in
his
throat
jan
breath
grew
quicker
his
blood
warmer
over
there
across
the
river
his
world
was
calling
to
him
and
he
jan
thoreau
was
now
free
to
go
this
very
night
he
would
bury
himself
in
the
forest
again
and
when
he
lay
down
to
sleep
it
would
be
with
his
beloved
stars
above
him
and
the
winds
whispering
sympathy
and
brotherhood
to
him
in
the
spruce
tops
he
would
go
now
he
would
say
to
thornton
and
go
he
found
himself
running
and
kazan
ran
beside
him
he
was
breathless
when
he
came
to
the
one
lighted
street
of
the
town
he
hurried
to
the
hotel
and
found
thornton
sitting
where
he
had
left
him
it
is
ended
he
cried
in
a
low
voice
it
is
over
and
i
am
going
i
am
going
thornton
rose
he
repeated
yes
now
i
am
going
to
pick
up
my
things
will
you
come
he
went
ahead
of
thornton
to
the
bare
little
room
in
which
he
had
slept
while
at
the
hotel
he
did
not
notice
the
change
in
thornton
until
he
had
lighted
a
lamp
thornton
was
looking
at
him
doggedly
there
was
an
unpleasant
look
in
his
face
a
flush
about
his
eyes
a
rigid
tenseness
in
the
muscles
of
his
jaws
and
i
i
too
am
going
he
said
into
the
south
no
into
the
north
there
was
a
fierceness
in
thornton
emphasis
he
stood
opposite
jan
leaning
over
the
table
on
which
the
light
was
placed
i
broken
loose
he
went
on
i
not
going
south
back
to
that
hell
of
mine
i
never
going
south
again
i
dead
down
there
dead
for
all
time
they
never
hear
of
me
again
they
can
have
my
fortune
everything
i
going
north
i
going
to
live
with
you
people
and
god
and
her
jan
sank
into
a
chair
thornton
sat
down
in
one
across
from
him
i
am
going
back
to
her
he
repeated
no
one
will
ever
know
he
could
not
account
for
the
look
in
jan
eyes
nor
for
the
nervous
twitching
of
the
lithe
brown
hands
that
reached
half
across
the
table
but
kazan
one
eye
told
him
more
than
thornton
could
guess
and
in
response
to
it
that
ominous
shivering
wave
rose
along
his
spine
thornton
would
never
know
that
jan
fingers
twitched
for
an
instant
in
their
old
mad
desire
to
leap
at
a
human
throat
you
will
not
do
that
he
said
quietly
yes
i
will
replied
thornton
i
have
made
up
my
mind
nothing
can
stop
me
but
death
there
is
one
other
thing
that
can
stop
you
and
will
said
jan
as
quietly
as
before
i
jan
thoreau
will
stop
you
thornton
rose
slowly
staring
down
into
jan
face
the
flush
about
his
eyes
grew
deeper
i
will
stop
you
repeated
jan
rising
also
and
i
am
not
death
he
went
to
thornton
and
placed
his
two
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
in
his
eyes
there
glowed
now
that
gentle
light
which
had
made
thornton
love
him
as
he
had
loved
no
other
man
on
earth
i
will
stop
you
he
said
again
speaking
as
though
to
a
brother
sit
down
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
and
when
i
have
told
you
this
you
will
take
my
hand
and
you
will
say
thoreau
i
thank
the
great
god
that
something
like
this
has
happened
before
and
that
it
has
come
to
my
ears
in
time
to
save
the
one
i
love
sit
down
chapter
xxvii
jan
story
jan
had
aged
five
years
during
those
two
hours
in
the
office
of
the
he
aged
now
as
thornton
looked
at
him
there
came
the
same
tired
hopeless
glow
into
his
eyes
the
same
tense
lines
in
his
face
and
yet
quickly
he
changed
as
he
had
not
changed
on
that
afternoon
two
livid
spots
began
to
burn
in
his
cheeks
as
he
sat
down
opposite
thornton
he
turned
the
light
low
and
his
eyes
glowed
more
darkly
and
with
an
luster
in
the
half
gloom
something
in
him
now
a
quivering
struggling
passion
that
lay
behind
those
eyes
held
thornton
white
and
silent
he
began
in
the
low
voice
which
thornton
was
beginning
to
understand
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
which
i
have
told
to
but
two
other
human
beings
it
is
the
story
of
another
man
a
man
from
civilization
like
you
who
came
up
into
this
country
of
ours
years
and
years
ago
and
who
met
a
woman
as
you
have
met
this
girl
at
oxford
house
and
who
loved
her
as
you
love
this
one
and
perhaps
more
it
is
singular
that
the
case
should
be
so
similar
and
it
is
because
of
this
that
i
believe
our
blessed
lady
gives
me
courage
to
tell
it
to
you
for
this
man
like
you
left
a
wife
and
two
children
when
he
came
into
the
north
i
pray
the
great
god
to
forgive
him
for
he
left
a
third
child
unborn
jan
leaned
upon
his
hand
so
that
it
shaded
his
face
it
is
not
so
much
of
that
as
of
what
followed
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
he
went
on
it
was
a
beautiful
love
on
the
part
and
it
would
have
been
a
beautiful
love
on
the
man
part
if
it
had
been
pure
for
her
he
gave
up
everything
even
his
god
as
you
would
give
up
everything
and
your
god
for
this
girl
at
oxford
house
i
will
speak
mostly
of
the
woman
now
she
was
beautiful
she
was
one
of
the
three
most
beautiful
things
that
god
ever
placed
in
our
world
and
she
loved
this
man
she
married
him
believed
in
him
was
ready
to
die
for
him
to
follow
him
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
as
our
women
will
do
for
the
men
they
love
god
in
heaven
can
you
not
guess
what
happened
a
child
was
born
so
fiercely
did
jan
cry
out
the
words
that
thornton
jerked
back
as
though
a
blow
had
been
struck
at
him
from
out
of
the
gloom
a
child
was
born
repeated
jan
and
thornton
heard
his
nails
digging
in
the
table
that
was
the
first
curse
of
god
a
child
la
charogne
les
bêtes
de
charogne
that
is
what
we
call
them
beasts
of
carrion
and
carrion
eaters
breeders
of
devils
and
sin
mon
dieu
that
is
what
happened
a
child
was
born
with
the
curse
of
god
upon
him
jan
stopped
his
nails
digging
deeper
his
breath
escaping
from
him
as
though
he
had
been
running
down
in
your
world
he
would
have
grown
up
a
man
he
continued
speaking
more
calmly
i
have
heard
that
since
it
is
common
down
there
to
be
a
carrion
a
man
or
a
woman
born
out
of
wedlock
i
have
been
told
so
and
that
it
is
a
curse
not
without
hope
but
here
it
is
different
the
curse
never
dies
it
follows
day
after
day
year
after
year
and
this
child
more
unfortunate
than
the
wild
things
was
born
one
of
them
do
you
understand
if
the
winds
had
whispered
the
secret
nothing
would
have
come
near
him
the
indian
women
would
sooner
have
touched
the
plague
he
would
have
been
an
outcast
despised
as
he
grew
older
pointed
at
and
taunted
called
names
which
are
worse
than
those
called
to
the
lowest
and
meanest
dogs
that
is
what
it
means
to
be
born
under
that
curse
up
here
he
waited
for
thornton
to
speak
but
the
other
sat
silent
and
moveless
across
the
table
the
curse
worked
swiftly
it
came
first
in
remorse
to
the
man
it
gnawed
at
his
soul
ate
him
alive
and
drove
him
from
place
to
place
with
the
woman
and
the
child
the
purity
and
love
of
the
woman
added
to
his
suffering
and
at
last
he
came
to
know
that
the
hand
of
god
had
fallen
upon
his
head
the
woman
saw
his
grief
but
did
not
know
the
reason
for
it
and
so
the
curse
first
came
to
her
they
went
north
far
north
above
the
barren
lands
and
the
curse
followed
there
it
gnawed
at
his
life
until
he
died
that
was
seven
years
after
the
child
was
born
the
oil
lamp
sputtered
and
began
to
smoke
and
with
a
quick
movement
jan
turned
the
wick
down
until
they
were
left
in
darkness
it
was
then
that
the
curse
began
to
fall
upon
the
woman
and
the
child
do
you
not
believe
that
about
the
sins
of
the
fathers
falling
upon
others
mon
dieu
it
is
so
it
is
so
it
came
in
many
small
ways
and
then
the
curse
it
came
suddenly
like
this
voice
came
in
a
hissing
whisper
now
thornton
could
feel
his
hot
breath
as
he
leaned
over
the
table
and
in
the
darkness
jan
eyes
shone
like
two
coals
of
fire
it
came
like
this
panted
there
was
a
new
missioner
at
the
post
a
a
christian
from
the
south
and
he
was
a
great
friend
to
the
woman
and
preached
god
and
she
believed
him
the
boy
was
very
young
and
saw
things
but
did
not
understand
at
first
he
knew
afterward
that
the
missioner
loved
his
mother
beauty
and
that
he
tried
hard
to
win
it
and
failed
for
the
woman
until
death
would
love
only
the
one
to
whom
she
had
given
herself
first
great
god
it
happened
then
one
night
when
every
soul
was
about
the
big
fires
at
the
caribou
roast
and
there
was
no
one
near
the
lonely
little
cabin
where
the
boy
and
his
mother
lived
the
boy
was
at
the
feast
but
he
ran
home
with
a
bit
of
dripping
meat
as
a
gift
for
his
mother
and
he
heard
her
cries
and
ran
in
to
be
struck
down
by
the
missioner
it
happened
then
and
even
the
boy
knew
and
followed
the
man
shrieking
that
he
had
killed
his
mother
there
was
a
terrible
calmness
now
in
jan
voice
it
was
true
she
wasted
away
like
a
flower
after
that
night
she
died
and
left
the
boy
alone
with
the
curse
and
that
boy
was
jan
thoreau
the
woman
was
his
mother
there
was
silence
now
a
dead
pulseless
quiet
broken
after
a
moment
by
a
movement
it
was
thornton
groping
across
the
table
jan
felt
his
hands
touch
his
arm
they
groped
farther
in
the
darkness
until
jan
thoreau
hands
were
clasped
tightly
in
thornton
and
that
is
all
he
questioned
hoarsely
no
it
is
but
the
beginning
said
jan
softly
the
curse
has
followed
me
until
i
am
the
unhappiest
man
in
the
world
i
have
done
all
that
is
to
be
done
when
my
father
died
he
left
papers
which
my
mother
was
to
give
to
me
when
i
had
attained
manhood
when
she
died
they
came
to
me
she
knew
nothing
of
that
which
was
in
them
and
i
am
glad
for
they
told
the
story
that
i
have
told
to
you
and
from
his
grave
my
father
prayed
to
me
to
make
what
restitution
i
could
when
he
came
into
the
north
for
good
he
brought
with
him
most
of
his
fortune
which
was
large
and
placed
it
where
no
one
would
ever
find
it
in
the
stock
of
the
great
company
a
half
of
it
he
said
should
be
mine
the
other
half
he
asked
me
to
return
to
his
children
and
to
his
real
wife
if
she
were
living
i
have
done
more
than
that
i
have
given
up
all
for
none
of
it
is
mine
a
half
will
go
to
the
two
children
whom
he
deserted
the
other
half
will
go
to
the
child
that
was
unborn
the
mother
is
dead
after
a
time
thornton
said
there
is
more
yes
there
is
more
said
so
much
more
that
if
i
were
to
tell
it
to
you
it
would
not
be
hard
for
you
to
understand
why
jan
thoreau
is
the
unhappiest
man
in
the
world
i
have
told
you
that
this
is
but
the
beginning
i
have
not
told
you
of
how
the
curse
has
followed
me
and
robbed
me
of
all
that
is
greatest
in
life
how
it
has
haunted
me
day
and
night
like
a
black
spirit
destroying
my
hopes
turning
me
at
last
into
an
outcast
without
people
without
friends
without
that
which
you
too
will
give
up
in
this
girl
at
oxford
house
am
i
right
you
will
not
go
back
to
her
you
will
go
south
and
some
day
the
great
god
will
reward
you
he
heard
thornton
rising
in
the
dark
shall
i
strike
a
light
no
said
thornton
close
to
him
in
the
gloom
their
hands
met
there
was
a
change
in
the
other
voice
now
something
of
pride
of
triumph
of
a
glory
just
achieved
jan
he
said
softly
i
thank
you
for
bringing
me
face
to
face
with
a
god
like
yours
i
have
never
met
him
before
we
send
missionaries
up
to
save
you
we
look
upon
you
as
wild
and
savage
and
with
only
half
a
soul
and
we
are
blind
you
have
taught
me
more
than
has
ever
been
preached
into
me
and
this
great
glorious
world
of
yours
is
sending
me
back
a
better
man
for
having
come
into
it
i
am
going
south
some
day
i
will
return
and
i
will
be
one
of
this
world
and
one
of
your
people
i
will
come
and
i
will
bring
no
curse
if
i
could
send
this
word
to
her
ask
her
forgiveness
tell
her
what
i
have
almost
been
and
that
i
still
have
hope
faith
i
could
go
easier
down
into
that
other
world
you
can
said
i
will
take
this
word
for
you
and
i
will
take
more
for
i
will
tell
her
what
it
has
been
the
kind
fate
for
jan
thoreau
to
find
in
the
heart
of
thornton
she
is
one
of
my
people
and
she
will
forgive
and
love
you
more
for
what
you
have
done
for
this
is
what
the
cree
god
has
given
to
his
people
as
the
honor
of
the
great
snows
she
will
still
love
you
and
if
there
is
to
be
hope
it
will
burn
in
her
breast
too
something
like
a
sob
broke
through
thornton
lips
as
he
moved
back
through
the
darkness
and
you
i
will
find
you
again
they
will
know
where
i
go
from
oxford
house
i
will
leave
word
with
her
said
said
thornton
huskily
jan
listened
until
his
footsteps
had
died
away
and
for
a
long
time
after
that
he
sat
with
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
upon
the
little
table
and
kazan
whining
softly
seemed
to
know
that
in
the
darkened
room
had
come
to
pass
the
thing
which
broke
at
last
his
overburdened
heart
chapter
xxviii
the
music
again
that
night
jan
thoreau
passed
for
the
last
time
back
into
the
shelter
of
his
forests
and
all
that
night
he
traveled
and
with
each
mile
that
he
left
behind
him
something
larger
and
bolder
grew
in
his
breast
until
he
cracked
his
whip
in
the
old
way
and
shouted
to
the
dogs
in
the
old
way
and
the
blood
in
him
sang
to
the
wild
spirit
of
the
wilderness
once
more
he
was
home
to
him
the
forest
had
always
been
home
filled
with
the
low
voice
of
whispering
winds
and
trees
and
it
was
more
his
home
than
ever
lonely
and
sick
at
heart
with
no
other
desire
than
to
bury
himself
deeper
and
deeper
into
it
he
felt
the
life
and
sympathy
and
love
of
it
creeping
into
his
heart
grieving
with
him
in
his
grief
warming
him
with
its
hope
pledging
him
again
the
eternal
friendship
of
its
trees
its
mountains
and
all
of
the
wild
that
it
held
therein
and
from
above
him
the
stars
looked
down
like
a
billion
tiny
fires
kindled
by
loving
hands
to
light
his
way
the
stars
that
had
given
him
music
peace
since
he
could
remember
and
that
had
taught
him
more
of
the
silent
power
of
god
than
the
lips
of
man
could
ever
tell
from
this
time
forth
jan
thoreau
knew
that
these
things
would
be
his
life
his
god
a
thousand
times
in
fanciful
play
he
had
given
life
and
form
to
the
about
him
to
the
shadows
of
the
tall
spruce
the
twisted
shrub
the
rocks
and
even
the
mountains
and
now
it
was
no
longer
play
with
each
hour
that
passed
this
night
and
with
each
day
and
night
that
followed
they
became
more
real
to
him
and
his
fires
in
the
black
gloom
painted
him
pictures
as
they
had
never
painted
them
before
and
the
trees
and
the
rocks
and
the
twisted
shrub
comforted
him
more
and
more
in
his
loneliness
and
gave
to
him
the
presence
of
life
in
their
movement
in
the
coming
and
going
of
their
everywhere
they
were
the
same
old
friends
unvarying
and
changeless
the
of
nodding
to
him
in
its
silent
way
was
the
same
that
had
nodded
to
him
last
night
a
hundred
nights
ago
the
stars
were
the
same
the
winds
whispering
to
him
in
the
were
the
same
everything
was
as
it
was
yesterday
years
ago
unchanged
never
leaving
him
never
growing
cold
in
their
devotion
he
had
loved
the
forest
now
he
worshipped
it
in
its
vast
silence
he
still
possessed
mélisse
it
whispered
to
him
still
of
her
old
love
of
their
days
and
years
of
happiness
and
with
his
forest
he
lived
these
days
over
and
over
again
and
when
he
slept
with
his
forest
he
dreamed
of
them
nearly
a
month
passed
before
he
reached
oxford
house
and
found
the
girl
whom
thornton
loved
he
did
as
thornton
had
asked
and
went
on
into
the
north
and
east
he
had
no
mission
now
except
to
roam
in
his
forests
he
went
down
the
hayes
getting
his
few
supplies
at
indian
camps
and
stopped
at
last
with
the
beginning
of
spring
far
up
on
the
cutaway
here
he
built
himself
a
camp
and
lived
for
a
time
setting
for
bear
then
he
struck
north
again
and
still
east
keeping
always
away
from
lac
bain
when
the
first
chill
winds
of
the
bay
brought
warning
of
winter
down
to
him
he
was
filled
for
a
time
with
a
longing
to
strike
north
and
west
to
go
once
more
back
to
his
barren
lands
but
instead
he
went
south
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
a
year
after
he
had
left
lac
bain
he
built
himself
a
cabin
deep
in
the
forest
of
god
river
fifty
miles
from
oxford
house
and
trapped
once
more
for
the
company
he
had
not
forgotten
his
promise
to
thornton
and
at
oxford
house
left
word
where
he
could
be
found
if
the
man
from
civilization
should
return
in
late
jan
returned
to
oxford
house
with
his
furs
it
was
on
the
night
of
the
day
that
he
came
into
the
post
that
he
heard
a
frenchman
who
had
come
down
from
the
north
speak
of
lac
bain
none
noticed
the
change
in
jan
face
as
he
hung
back
in
the
shadows
of
the
company
store
a
little
later
he
followed
the
frenchman
outside
and
stopped
him
where
there
were
no
others
near
to
overhear
you
spoke
of
lac
bain
he
said
in
french
you
have
been
there
yes
replied
the
other
i
was
there
for
a
week
waiting
for
the
first
sledge
snow
it
is
my
old
home
said
jan
trying
to
keep
his
voice
natural
i
have
wondered
if
there
are
changes
you
saw
cummins
the
factor
yes
he
was
there
and
and
jean
de
gravois
the
chief
man
he
was
away
mon
dieu
listen
to
that
the
dogs
are
fighting
out
there
a
moment
begged
jan
as
the
frenchman
made
a
movement
as
if
to
run
in
the
direction
of
the
tumult
the
factor
had
a
daughter
mélisse
she
left
lac
bain
a
long
time
ago
interrupted
the
trapper
making
a
tremendous
effort
to
be
polite
as
he
edged
toward
the
sound
of
battle
cummins
told
me
that
he
had
not
seen
her
in
a
long
time
i
believe
it
was
almost
a
year
sacre
listen
to
that
they
are
tearing
one
another
to
bits
and
they
are
my
dogs
for
i
can
tell
their
voices
among
a
thousand
he
sprang
through
the
darkness
and
jan
made
a
movement
to
follow
then
he
stopped
and
turned
instead
to
the
company
store
he
took
his
pack
to
the
sledge
and
dogs
in
the
edge
of
the
spruce
and
kazan
leaped
to
greet
him
at
the
end
of
his
babiche
this
night
as
jan
traveled
through
the
forest
he
did
not
notice
the
stars
or
the
friendly
shadows
a
year
he
repeated
to
himself
again
and
again
and
once
when
kazan
rubbed
against
his
leg
and
looked
up
into
his
face
he
said
ah
kazan
our
mélisse
went
away
with
the
englishman
may
the
great
god
give
them
happiness
the
forest
claimed
him
more
than
ever
after
this
he
did
not
go
back
to
oxford
house
in
the
spring
but
sold
his
furs
to
a
passing
and
wandered
through
all
of
that
spring
and
summer
in
the
country
to
the
west
it
was
january
when
he
returned
to
his
cabin
when
the
snows
were
deepest
and
three
days
later
he
set
out
to
outfit
at
the
bay
post
on
god
lake
instead
of
at
oxford
house
it
was
while
they
were
crossing
a
part
of
the
lake
that
kazan
leaped
aside
for
an
instant
in
his
traces
and
snapped
at
something
in
the
snow
jan
saw
the
movement
but
gave
no
attention
to
it
until
a
little
later
when
kazan
stopped
and
fell
upon
his
belly
biting
at
the
harness
and
whining
in
pain
the
thought
of
kazan
sudden
snap
at
the
snow
came
to
him
then
like
a
and
with
a
low
cry
of
horror
and
fear
he
fell
upon
his
knees
beside
the
dog
kazan
whimpered
and
his
bushy
tail
swept
the
snow
as
jan
lifted
his
great
wolfish
head
between
his
two
hands
no
other
sound
came
from
jan
lips
now
and
slowly
he
drew
the
dog
up
to
him
until
he
held
him
in
his
arms
as
he
might
have
held
a
child
kazan
stilled
the
whimpering
sounds
in
his
throat
his
one
eye
rested
on
his
master
face
faithful
watching
for
some
sign
for
some
language
there
even
as
the
burning
fires
of
a
strange
torture
gnawed
at
his
life
and
in
that
eye
jan
saw
the
deepening
reddish
film
which
he
had
seen
a
hundred
times
before
in
the
eyes
of
foxes
and
wolves
killed
by
poison
bait
a
moan
of
anguish
burst
from
jan
lips
and
he
held
his
face
close
down
against
kazan
head
and
sobbed
now
like
a
child
while
kazan
rubbed
his
hot
muzzle
against
his
cheek
and
his
muscles
hardened
in
a
last
desire
to
give
battle
to
whatever
was
giving
his
master
grief
it
was
a
long
time
before
jan
lifted
his
face
from
the
shaggy
head
and
when
he
did
he
knew
that
the
last
of
all
love
of
all
companionship
of
all
that
bound
him
to
flesh
and
blood
in
his
lonely
world
was
gone
kazan
was
dead
from
the
sledge
he
took
a
blanket
and
wrapped
kazan
in
it
and
carried
him
a
hundred
yards
back
from
the
trail
with
bowed
head
he
came
behind
his
four
dogs
into
god
house
half
an
hour
later
he
turned
back
into
the
wilderness
with
his
supplies
it
was
dark
when
he
returned
to
where
he
had
left
kazan
he
placed
him
upon
the
sledge
and
the
four
huskies
whined
as
they
dragged
on
their
burden
from
which
the
smell
of
death
came
to
them
they
stopped
in
the
deep
forests
beyond
the
lake
and
jan
built
a
fire
this
night
as
on
all
nights
in
his
lonely
life
jan
drew
kazan
close
to
him
and
he
shivered
as
the
other
dogs
slunk
back
from
him
suspiciously
and
the
fire
and
the
spruce
tops
broke
the
stillness
of
the
forest
he
looked
at
the
crackling
flames
at
the
fitful
shadows
which
they
set
dancing
and
grimacing
about
him
and
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
they
were
no
longer
friends
but
were
taunting
him
gloating
in
kazan
death
and
telling
him
that
he
was
alone
alone
alone
he
let
the
fire
die
down
stirring
it
into
life
only
when
the
cold
stiffened
him
and
when
at
last
he
fell
into
an
unquiet
slumber
it
was
still
to
hear
the
spruce
tops
whispering
to
him
that
kazan
was
dead
and
that
in
dying
he
had
broken
the
last
fragile
link
between
jan
thoreau
and
mélisse
he
went
on
at
dawn
with
kazan
wrapped
in
his
blanket
on
the
sledge
he
planned
to
reach
the
cabin
that
night
and
the
next
day
he
would
bury
his
old
comrade
it
was
dark
when
he
came
to
the
narrow
plain
that
lay
between
him
and
the
river
the
sky
was
brilliant
with
stars
when
he
slowly
climbed
the
big
barren
ridge
at
the
foot
of
which
was
his
home
at
the
summit
he
stopped
and
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
rock
with
nothing
but
a
thousand
miles
of
space
between
him
and
the
pale
glow
of
the
northern
lights
at
his
feet
lay
the
forest
black
and
silent
and
he
looked
down
to
where
he
knew
his
cabin
was
waiting
for
him
black
and
silent
too
for
the
first
time
it
came
upon
him
that
this
was
home
that
the
forest
and
the
silence
and
the
little
cabin
hidden
under
the
spruce
tops
below
held
a
deeper
meaning
for
him
than
a
few
hours
before
when
kazan
was
a
leaping
living
comrade
at
his
side
kazan
was
dead
down
there
he
would
bury
him
and
he
had
loved
kazan
he
knew
now
as
he
clutched
his
hands
to
his
aching
breast
that
he
would
have
fought
for
kazan
given
up
his
life
for
him
as
he
would
have
done
for
a
brother
down
there
under
the
silent
spruce
he
would
bury
the
last
that
had
remained
to
him
of
the
old
life
and
there
swelled
up
in
his
heart
a
longing
almost
a
prayer
that
mélisse
might
know
that
he
jan
thoreau
would
have
nothing
left
to
him
but
a
grave
and
that
in
that
grave
was
their
old
chum
their
old
playmate
kazan
hot
tears
blinded
jan
eyes
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
sobbed
as
he
had
sobbed
years
before
when
in
the
southern
wilderness
word
came
to
him
that
mélisse
was
dying
mélisse
mélisse
he
moaned
her
name
aloud
and
stared
through
the
hot
film
in
his
eyes
away
into
the
north
sobbing
to
her
calling
to
her
in
his
grief
and
looking
through
that
thousand
miles
of
starlit
space
as
though
from
out
of
it
her
sweet
face
would
come
to
him
once
more
and
as
he
called
there
seemed
to
come
to
him
from
out
of
that
space
a
sound
so
sweet
and
low
and
tender
that
his
heart
stood
still
and
he
stood
up
straight
and
stretched
his
arms
up
to
heaven
for
jan
thoreau
knew
that
it
was
the
sound
of
a
violin
that
came
to
him
from
out
of
the
north
that
mélisse
an
infinity
away
had
heard
his
call
his
prayer
and
was
playing
for
him
and
kazan
and
suddenly
as
he
listened
his
arms
fell
to
his
sides
and
there
shot
into
his
eyes
all
of
the
concentrated
light
of
the
stars
for
the
music
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
still
nearer
to
him
until
he
caught
kazan
in
his
arms
and
ran
with
him
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
it
died
now
in
the
forest
then
rose
again
softer
and
more
distant
it
seemed
to
him
luring
him
on
into
the
forest
gloom
for
a
few
moments
consciousness
of
all
else
but
that
sound
remained
with
him
only
in
a
dazed
half
real
way
and
as
john
cummins
had
called
upon
the
angels
at
lac
bain
many
years
ago
when
he
too
had
gone
out
into
the
night
to
meet
this
wonderful
music
so
jan
thoreau
soul
cried
to
them
now
as
he
clutched
kazan
to
him
and
stumbled
on
then
suddenly
he
came
upon
the
cabin
and
in
the
cabin
there
was
a
light
gently
he
laid
kazan
down
upon
the
snow
and
for
a
full
minute
he
stood
and
listened
and
heard
lower
and
sweeter
still
the
gentle
music
of
the
violin
some
one
was
in
his
cabin
living
hands
were
playing
after
all
it
was
not
the
spirit
of
mélisse
that
had
come
to
him
in
the
hour
of
his
deepest
grief
and
a
sob
rose
in
his
throat
he
went
on
step
by
step
and
at
the
door
he
stopped
again
wondering
if
he
was
mad
if
the
spirits
of
the
forest
were
taunting
him
still
if
if
one
step
more
the
great
god
he
heard
it
now
the
low
sweet
music
of
the
old
cree
love
song
played
in
the
old
old
way
with
all
of
its
old
sadness
its
whispering
joy
its
weeping
song
of
life
of
death
of
love
with
a
great
cry
he
flung
open
the
door
and
leaped
in
with
his
arms
reaching
out
his
eyes
blinded
for
a
moment
by
the
sudden
light
and
with
a
cry
as
piercing
as
his
own
something
ran
through
that
light
to
meet
him
mélisse
the
old
glorious
mélisse
crushing
her
arms
about
his
neck
sobbing
his
name
pleading
with
him
in
her
old
sweet
voice
to
kiss
her
kiss
her
kiss
her
while
jan
thoreau
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
felt
sweeping
over
him
a
resistless
weakness
and
in
this
vision
he
knew
that
jean
de
gravois
came
to
him
too
and
held
him
in
his
arms
and
that
as
the
light
faded
away
from
about
him
he
still
heard
mélisse
calling
to
him
felt
her
arms
about
him
her
face
crushed
to
his
own
and
as
the
deep
gloom
enveloped
him
more
densely
and
he
felt
himself
slipping
down
through
it
he
whispered
to
the
faces
which
he
could
no
longer
see
kazan
died
for
a
long
time
jan
fought
to
throw
off
the
darkness
and
when
he
succeeded
and
opened
his
eyes
again
he
knew
that
it
was
mélisse
who
was
sitting
beside
him
and
that
it
was
mélisse
who
flung
her
arms
about
him
when
he
awoke
from
his
strange
sleep
and
held
his
wild
head
pressed
against
her
bosom
mélisse
with
her
glorious
hair
flowing
about
her
as
he
had
loved
it
in
their
old
days
and
with
the
old
love
shining
in
her
eyes
only
more
glorious
now
as
he
heard
her
voice
jan
jan
we
have
been
hunting
for
you
so
long
she
cried
softly
we
have
been
searching
ever
since
you
left
lac
bain
jan
dear
jan
i
loved
you
so
and
you
almost
broke
my
heart
dear
dear
jan
she
sobbed
stroking
his
face
now
i
know
why
you
ran
away
i
know
and
i
love
you
so
that
that
i
will
die
if
you
go
away
again
you
know
breathed
jan
he
was
in
his
cot
and
raised
himself
clasping
her
beautiful
face
between
his
two
hands
staring
at
her
with
the
old
horror
in
his
eyes
you
know
and
you
come
to
me
i
love
you
said
mélisse
she
slipped
up
to
him
and
laid
her
face
upon
his
breast
and
with
her
fingers
clutched
in
his
long
hair
she
leaned
over
to
him
and
kissed
him
i
love
you
jan
arms
closed
about
her
and
he
bowed
his
face
so
that
it
was
smothered
in
her
hair
and
he
felt
against
it
the
joyous
tremble
of
her
bosom
i
love
you
she
whispered
again
and
under
her
cloud
of
hair
their
lips
met
and
she
whispered
again
with
her
sweet
breath
still
upon
his
lips
i
love
you
outside
jean
de
gravois
was
dancing
up
and
down
in
the
starlit
edge
of
the
forest
and
iowaka
was
looking
at
him
and
now
what
do
you
think
of
your
jean
de
gravois
cried
jean
for
the
hundredth
time
at
least
now
what
do
you
think
of
him
my
beautiful
one
and
he
caught
iowaka
head
in
his
arms
for
the
hundredth
time
too
and
kissed
her
until
she
pushed
him
away
was
it
not
right
for
me
to
break
my
oath
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
tell
mélisse
why
jan
thoreau
had
gone
mad
was
it
not
right
i
say
and
did
not
mélisse
do
as
i
told
that
fool
of
a
jan
that
she
would
do
and
did
she
hate
the
englishman
all
of
the
time
eh
can
you
not
speak
my
angel
he
hugged
iowaka
again
in
his
arms
and
this
time
he
did
not
let
her
go
but
turned
her
face
so
that
the
starlight
fell
upon
it
and
now
what
if
jan
thoreau
still
feels
that
the
curse
is
upon
him
he
asked
softly
ho
ho
we
have
fixed
that
you
my
sweet
iowaka
and
your
husband
jean
de
gravois
i
have
it
here
in
my
pocket
the
letter
signed
by
the
at
prince
albert
to
whom
i
told
jan
story
when
i
followed
his
trail
down
there
the
letter
which
says
that
the
other
woman
died
before
the
man
who
was
to
be
jan
father
married
the
woman
who
was
to
be
his
mother
and
now
do
you
understand
why
i
did
not
tell
mélisse
of
this
letter
ma
chérie
it
was
to
prove
to
that
fool
of
a
jan
thoreau
that
she
loved
him
whatever
he
was
now
what
do
you
think
of
jean
de
gravois
you
daughter
of
a
princess
you
you
wife
of
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
laughed
iowaka
softly
come

foolish
jean

not
stand
out
for
ever

am
growing
cold
and
besides
do
you
not
suppose
that
jan
would
like
to
see
me
foolish

foolish
murmured
jean
as
they
walked
hand
in
hand
through
the
starlight
she
my
iowaka
my
beloved
says
that
i
am
foolish
and
after
this
mon
dieu
what
can
a
man
do
to
make
himself
great
in
the
eyes
of
his
wife
the
end
