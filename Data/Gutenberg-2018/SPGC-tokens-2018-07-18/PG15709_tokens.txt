i
the
play
box
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
along
the
hall
miss
terry
looked
up
from
the
letter
which
she
was
reading
for
the
sixth
time
of
course
i
would
not
see
him
she
said
pursing
her
lips
into
a
hard
line
certainly
not
a
bump
on
the
library
door
as
from
an
opposing
knee
did
duty
for
a
knock
bring
the
box
in
here
norah
said
miss
terry
holding
open
the
door
for
her
servant
who
was
gasping
under
the
weight
of
a
set
it
down
on
the
rug
by
the
i
am
going
to
look
it
over
and
burn
up
the
rubbish
this
evening
she
glanced
once
more
at
the
letter
in
her
hand
then
with
a
sniff
tossed
it
upon
the
fire
yes
said
norah
as
she
set
down
the
box
with
a
thump
she
stooped
once
more
to
pick
up
something
which
had
fallen
out
when
the
cover
was
jarred
open
it
was
a
pink
angel
such
as
are
often
hung
from
the
top
of
christmas
trees
as
a
crowning
symbol
norah
stood
holding
it
between
thumb
and
finger
staring
amazedly
who
would
think
to
find
such
a
bit
of
frivolity
in
the
house
of
miss
terry
her
mistress
looked
up
from
the
fire
where
the
bit
of
writing
was
writhing
painfully
and
caught
the
expression
of
norah
face
what
have
you
there
she
asked
frowning
as
she
took
the
object
into
her
own
hands
the
christmas
angel
she
exclaimed
under
her
breath
i
had
quite
forgotten
it
then
as
if
it
burned
her
fingers
she
thrust
the
little
image
back
into
the
box
and
turned
to
norah
brusquely
there
that
all
you
can
go
now
norah
she
said
yes
answered
the
maid
she
hesitated
if
you
please
it
christmas
eve
well
i
believe
so
snapped
miss
terry
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
particularly
bad
humor
this
evening
what
do
you
want
norah
flushed
but
she
was
hardened
to
her
mistress
manner
only
to
ask
if
i
may
go
out
for
a
little
while
to
see
the
decorations
and
hear
the
singing
decorations
singing
fiddlestick
retorted
miss
terry
poker
in
hand
what
decorations
what
singing
why
all
the
windows
along
the
street
are
full
of
candles
answered
norah
rows
of
candles
in
every
house
to
light
the
christ
child
on
his
way
when
he
comes
through
the
city
fiddlestick
again
snarled
her
mistress
and
are
going
about
the
streets
they
say
singing
carols
in
front
of
the
lighted
houses
continued
norah
enthusiastically
it
must
sound
so
pretty
they
had
much
better
be
at
home
in
bed
i
believe
people
are
losing
their
minds
please
may
i
go
asked
norah
again
norah
had
no
puritanic
traditions
to
her
account
moreover
she
was
young
and
warm
and
enthusiastic
sometimes
the
spell
of
miss
terry
sombre
house
threatened
her
to
the
point
of
desperation
it
was
so
this
christmas
eve
but
she
made
her
request
with
apparent
calmness
yes
go
along
assented
her
mistress
ungraciously
thank
you
said
the
servant
demurely
but
with
a
brightening
of
her
blue
eyes
and
presently
the
area
door
banged
behind
her
footsteps
h
did
take
her
long
to
get
ready
muttered
miss
terry
giving
the
fire
a
vicious
poke
she
was
alone
in
the
house
on
christmas
eve
and
not
a
man
woman
or
child
in
the
world
cared
well
it
was
what
she
wanted
it
was
of
her
own
doing
if
she
had
wished
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
with
thin
long
hands
lying
along
the
arms
of
it
gazing
into
the
fire
a
bit
of
paper
there
was
crumbling
into
ashes
alone
on
christmas
eve
even
norah
had
some
relation
with
the
world
outside
was
there
not
a
stalwart
officer
waiting
for
her
on
the
nearest
corner
even
norah
could
feel
a
simple
childish
pleasure
in
candles
and
carols
and
merriment
and
the
old
old
superstition
stuff
and
nonsense
mused
miss
terry
scornfully
what
is
our
christmas
anyway
a
time
for
shopkeepers
to
sell
and
for
foolish
folks
to
kill
themselves
in
buying
christmas
spirit
no
it
is
all
humbug
all
selfishness
and
worry
an
unwholesome
season
of
unnatural
activities
i
am
glad
i
am
out
of
it
i
am
glad
no
one
expects
anything
of
me
nor
i
of
any
one
i
am
quite
independent
blessedly
independent
of
the
whole
foolish
business
it
is
a
good
time
to
begin
clearing
up
for
the
new
year
i
glad
i
thought
of
it
i
long
threatened
to
get
rid
of
the
stuff
that
has
been
accumulating
in
that
corner
of
the
attic
now
i
will
begin
she
tugged
the
an
inch
nearer
the
fire
it
was
like
miss
terry
to
insist
upon
that
nearer
inch
then
she
raised
the
cover
it
was
a
box
full
of
children
battered
toys
and
quaint
the
toys
in
vogue
thirty
forty
fifty
years
earlier
when
miss
terry
was
a
child
she
gave
a
reminiscent
sniff
as
she
threw
up
the
cover
and
saw
on
the
under
side
of
it
a
big
label
of
pasteboard
unevenly
lettered
illustration
play
box
of
tom
terry
and
angelina
terry
scrawl
humph
she
snorted
there
was
a
great
deal
in
that
humph
it
meant
yes
tom
name
had
plenty
of
room
while
poor
little
angelina
had
to
squeeze
in
as
well
as
she
could
how
like
tom
this
accounted
for
everything
even
to
his
not
being
in
his
sister
house
this
very
night
how
unreasonable
he
had
been
miss
terry
shrugged
impatiently
why
think
of
tom
years
ago
he
had
deliberately
cut
himself
adrift
from
her
interests
no
need
to
think
of
him
now
it
was
too
late
to
appease
her
but
here
were
all
these
toys
to
be
got
rid
of
the
fire
was
hungry
for
them
why
not
begin
miss
terry
stooped
to
poke
over
the
contents
of
the
box
with
lean
long
fingers
in
one
corner
thrust
up
a
doll
arm
in
another
an
animal
tail
pointed
heavenward
she
caught
glimpses
of
glitter
and
tinsel
wheels
and
fragments
of
unidentifiable
toys
what
rubbish
she
said
yes
i
burn
them
all
they
are
good
for
nothing
else
i
suppose
some
folks
would
try
to
give
them
away
and
bore
a
lot
of
people
to
death
they
seem
to
think
they
are
saving
something
that
way
nonsense
i
know
better
it
is
all
foolishness
this
craze
for
giving
most
things
are
better
destroyed
as
soon
as
you
are
done
with
them
why
nobody
wants
such
truck
as
this
now
could
any
child
ever
have
cared
for
so
silly
a
thing
she
pulled
out
a
faded
and
regarded
it
scornfully
idiotic
such
toys
are
demoralizing
for
children
weaken
their
minds
it
is
a
shame
to
think
how
every
one
seems
bound
to
spoil
children
especially
at
christmas
time
well
no
one
can
say
that
i
have
added
to
the
shameful
waste
miss
terry
tossed
the
poor
on
the
fire
and
eyed
his
last
contortions
with
grim
satisfaction
but
as
she
watched
a
quaint
idea
came
to
her
she
was
famous
for
eccentric
ideas
i
will
try
an
experiment
she
said
i
will
prove
once
for
all
my
point
about
the
spirit
i
will
drop
some
of
these
old
toys
out
on
the
sidewalk
and
see
what
happens
it
may
be
interesting
chapter
ii
miss
terry
rose
and
crossed
two
rooms
to
the
front
window
looking
out
upon
the
street
a
flare
of
light
almost
blinded
her
eyes
every
window
opposite
her
along
the
block
as
far
as
she
could
see
was
illuminated
with
a
row
of
lighted
candles
across
the
sash
the
soft
unusual
glow
threw
into
relief
the
pretty
curtains
and
wreaths
of
green
and
gave
glimpses
of
cosy
interiors
and
flitting
happy
figures
what
a
waste
of
candles
scolded
miss
terry
folks
are
growing
terribly
extravagant
the
street
was
white
with
snow
which
had
fallen
a
few
hours
earlier
piled
in
drifts
along
the
curb
of
the
terrace
but
the
sidewalks
were
neatly
shoveled
and
swept
clean
as
became
the
eminently
respectable
part
of
the
city
where
miss
terry
lived
a
long
flight
of
steps
with
iron
railing
at
the
side
led
down
from
the
front
door
upon
which
a
silver
plate
had
for
generations
in
decorous
flourishes
announced
the
name
of
terry
miss
terry
returned
to
the
play
box
and
drew
out
between
thumb
and
finger
the
topmost
toy
it
happened
to
be
a
wooden
box
with
a
wire
hasp
for
fastening
the
cover
half
unconsciously
she
pressed
the
spring
and
a
hideous
sprang
out
to
confront
her
with
a
squeak
a
leering
smile
and
a
red
nose
miss
terry
eyed
him
with
disfavor
i
always
did
hate
that
thing
she
said
tom
was
continually
frightening
me
with
it
i
remember
as
if
to
be
rid
of
unwelcome
memories
she
shut
her
mouth
tight
even
as
she
shut
jack
back
into
his
box
snapping
the
spring
into
place
this
will
do
to
begin
with
she
thought
she
crossed
to
the
window
which
she
opened
quickly
and
tossed
out
the
box
so
that
it
fell
squarely
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
then
closing
the
window
and
turning
down
the
lights
in
the
room
behind
her
miss
terry
hid
in
the
folds
of
the
curtain
and
watched
to
see
what
would
happen
to
jack
the
street
was
quiet
few
persons
passed
on
either
side
at
last
she
spied
two
little
ragamuffins
approaching
they
seemed
to
be
jewish
lads
of
the
newsboy
class
and
they
eyed
the
display
of
candles
appraisingly
the
smaller
boy
first
caught
sight
of
the
box
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
hello
wot
dis
he
grunted
making
a
dash
upon
it
gee
wot
up
responded
the
other
who
was
instantly
at
his
elbow
gwan
lem
me
look
at
it
the
smaller
boy
drew
away
and
pressed
the
spring
of
the
box
eagerly
out
popped
the
jack
into
his
astonished
face
whereupon
he
set
up
a
guffaw
give
it
here
commanded
the
bigger
boy
naw
you
let
it
alone
it
mine
asserted
the
other
edging
away
along
the
curbstone
i
saw
it
first
you
ca
have
it
give
it
here
i
saw
it
first
myself
hand
it
over
or
i
smash
you
the
bigger
boy
advanced
threateningly
i
wo
the
other
whimpered
clasping
the
box
tightly
under
his
jacket
he
started
to
run
but
the
bigger
fellow
was
too
quick
for
him
he
pounced
across
the
sidewalk
and
soon
the
twain
were
struggling
in
the
snowdrift
pummeling
one
another
with
might
and
main
i
told
you
so
commented
miss
terry
from
behind
the
curtain
here
the
first
show
of
the
beautiful
christmas
spirit
that
is
supposed
to
be
abroad
look
at
the
little
beasts
fighting
over
something
that
neither
of
them
really
wants
just
then
miss
terry
spied
a
figure
leisurely
approaching
at
the
same
moment
an
instinct
seemed
to
warn
the
struggling
urchins
cop
said
a
muffled
voice
from
the
pile
of
arms
and
legs
and
in
an
instant
two
black
shadows
were
flitting
down
the
street
but
not
before
the
bigger
boy
had
wrenched
the
box
from
the
pocket
of
the
little
chap
so
that
is
the
end
of
experiment
number
one
quoth
miss
terry
smiling
grimly
it
happened
just
about
as
i
expected
they
will
be
fighting
again
as
soon
as
they
are
out
of
sight
they
are
jews
but
that
does
make
any
difference
about
the
christmas
spirit
now
let
see
what
becomes
of
the
next
experiment
chapter
iii
the
flanton
dog
she
returned
to
the
play
box
by
the
fire
and
rummaged
for
a
few
minutes
among
the
tangled
toys
then
with
something
like
a
chuckle
she
drew
out
a
soft
pale
creature
with
four
wobbly
legs
the
flanton
dog
she
said
well
i
vow
i
had
forgotten
all
about
him
it
was
tom
who
coined
the
name
for
him
because
he
was
made
of
canton
flannel
she
stood
the
thing
up
on
the
table
as
well
as
his
weak
legs
would
allow
and
inspected
him
critically
he
certainly
was
a
forlorn
specimen
one
of
the
black
beads
which
had
served
him
for
eyes
was
gone
his
ears
which
had
originally
stood
up
saucily
on
his
head
now
drooped
in
limp
dejection
one
of
them
was
a
mere
shapeless
rag
hanging
by
a
thread
he
was
dirty
and
discolored
and
his
tail
was
gone
but
still
he
smiled
with
his
mouth
and
seemed
trying
to
make
the
best
of
things
what
a
nightmare
said
miss
terry
contemptuously
i
know
there
is
a
child
in
the
city
who
wants
such
a
looking
thing
why
even
the
animal
rescue
folks
would
give
the
boys
a
shot
at
that
this
is
going
to
bring
out
any
christmas
spirit
she
sneered
i
will
try
it
and
see
once
more
she
lifted
the
window
and
tossed
the
dog
to
the
sidewalk
he
rolled
upon
his
back
and
lay
pathetically
with
crooked
legs
yearning
upward
still
smiling
hardly
had
miss
terry
time
to
conceal
herself
behind
the
curtain
when
she
saw
a
figure
approaching
airily
waving
a
stick
no
ragamuffin
this
time
she
said
hello
it
is
that
young
cooper
fellow
from
the
next
block
they
say
he
is
a
millionaire
well
he
is
even
going
to
see
the
flanton
dog
the
young
man
came
swinging
along
debonairly
he
was
whistling
under
his
breath
he
was
a
dapper
figure
in
a
long
coat
and
a
silk
hat
under
which
the
candles
lighted
a
rather
silly
face
when
he
reached
the
spot
in
the
sidewalk
where
the
flanton
dog
lay
he
paused
a
moment
looking
down
then
he
poked
the
object
with
his
stick
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
a
mother
and
her
little
boy
were
passing
at
the
time
the
child
eyes
caught
sight
of
the
dog
on
the
sidewalk
and
he
hung
back
watching
to
see
what
the
young
man
would
do
to
it
but
his
mother
drew
him
after
her
just
then
an
automobile
came
panting
through
the
snow
with
a
quick
movement
cooper
picked
up
the
dog
on
the
end
of
his
stick
and
tossed
it
into
the
street
under
the
wheels
of
the
machine
the
baby
across
the
street
uttered
a
howl
of
anguish
at
the
sight
miss
terry
herself
was
surprised
to
feel
a
pang
shoot
through
her
as
the
car
passed
over
the
queer
old
toy
she
retreated
from
the
window
quickly
well
that
the
end
of
flanton
she
said
with
half
a
sigh
i
knew
that
fellow
was
a
brute
i
might
have
expected
something
like
that
but
it
looked
so
so
she
hesitated
for
a
word
and
did
not
finish
her
sentence
but
bit
her
lip
and
sniffed
cynically

comes

miss
terry
rummaged
in
the
box
until
her
fingers
met
something
long
and
with
some
difficulty
she
drew
out
the
object
for
it
was
of
good
size
h
the
old
noah
ark
she
said
i
wonder
if
all
the
animals
are
in
there
she
lifted
the
cover
and
turned
out
into
her
lap
the
animals
and
their
chief
noah
and
her
sons
had
long
since
disappeared
but
the
hatless
and
still
presided
over
a
menagerie
of
sorry
beasts
scarcely
one
could
boast
of
being
a
quadruped
to
few
of
them
the
years
had
spared
a
tail
from
their
close
resemblance
in
their
misery
it
was
not
hard
to
believe
in
the
kinship
of
all
animal
life
she
took
them
up
and
examined
them
curiously
one
by
one
finally
she
selected
a
shapeless
block
from
the
mass
this
was
the
elephant
she
mused
i
remember
when
tom
stepped
on
him
and
smashed
his
trunk
guess
i
going
to
be
an
expressman
when
i
grow
up
he
said
looking
sorry
tom
was
always
full
of
his
jokes
now
i
try
this
and
see
what
happens
to
the
ark
on
its
last
voyage
just
then
there
was
a
noise
outside
an
automobile
honked
past
and
miss
terry
shuddered
recalling
the
pathetic
end
of
the
flanton
dog
which
had
given
her
quite
a
turn
i
hate
those
horrid
machines
she
exclaimed
they
seem
like
juggernaut
i
like
to
forbid
their
going
through
this
street
she
crowded
the
elephant
with
noah
and
the
rest
of
his
charge
back
into
the
ark
and
closed
the
lid
i
ca
throw
this
out
of
the
window
she
reflected
they
would
spill
i
must
take
it
out
on
the
sidewalk
land
the
fire
going
out
that
girl
does
know
how
to
build
fires
so
they
will
keep
she
laid
the
noah
ark
on
the
table
and
going
to
the
closet
tugged
out
several
big
logs
which
she
arranged
geometrically
about
laying
fires
as
about
most
other
things
miss
terry
had
her
own
positive
theories
taking
the
bellows
in
hand
she
blew
furiously
and
was
presently
rewarded
with
a
brisk
blaze
she
smiled
with
satisfaction
and
trotted
upstairs
to
find
her
red
knit
shawl
with
this
about
her
shoulders
she
was
prepared
to
brave
the
december
frost
down
the
steps
she
went
and
deposited
the
ark
discreetly
at
their
foot
then
returned
to
take
up
her
position
behind
the
curtains
there
were
a
good
many
people
passing
but
they
seemed
too
preoccupied
to
glance
down
at
the
sidewalk
they
were
nearly
all
hurrying
in
one
direction
some
were
running
in
the
middle
of
the
street
they
are
in
a
great
hurry
sniffed
miss
terry
disdainfully
one
would
think
they
had
something
really
important
on
hand
i
suppose
they
are
going
to
hear
the
singing
fiddlestick
a
man
hastened
by
under
the
window
a
woman
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
running
and
gesticulating
eagerly
none
of
them
noticed
the
ark
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
miss
terry
began
to
grow
impatient
are
they
all
blind
she
fretted
what
is
the
matter
with
them
i
wish
somebody
would
find
the
thing
i
am
tired
of
seeing
it
lying
there
she
tapped
the
floor
impatiently
with
her
slipper
just
then
a
woman
approached
she
was
dressed
in
the
most
uncompromising
of
mourning
and
she
walked
slowly
with
bent
head
never
glancing
at
the
lighted
windows
on
either
side
she
will
see
it
commented
miss
terry
and
sure
enough
she
did
she
stopped
at
the
doorstep
drew
her
skirts
aside
and
bent
over
to
look
at
the
box
at
her
feet
finally
she
lifted
it
but
immediately
she
shivered
and
acted
so
strangely
that
miss
terry
thought
she
was
about
to
break
the
toy
in
pieces
on
the
steps
or
throw
it
into
the
street
evidently
she
detested
the
sight
of
it
just
then
up
came
a
second
woman
with
two
small
boys
hanging
at
her
skirts
they
were
ragged
and
there
was
something
about
the
expression
of
even
the
tiny
knot
of
hair
at
the
back
of
the
woman
head
which
told
of
anxious
poverty
with
envious
curiosity
she
hurried
up
to
see
what
a
luckier
mortal
had
found
crowding
to
look
over
her
shoulder
the
woman
in
black
drew
haughtily
away
and
clutched
the
noah
ark
with
a
gesture
of
proprietorship
go
away
this
is
my
affair
miss
terry
read
her
expression
and
sniffed
there
is
the
christmas
spirit
coming
out
again
she
said
to
herself
look
at
her
face
the
woman
prepared
to
move
on
with
the
toy
under
her
arm
but
the
second
woman
caught
hold
of
her
skirt
and
began
to
speak
earnestly
she
pointed
to
the
noah
ark
then
to
her
two
children
her
eyes
were
beseeching
the
little
boys
crowded
forward
eagerly
but
some
wicked
spirit
seemed
to
have
seized
the
finder
of
the
ark
angrily
she
shook
off
the
hand
of
the
other
woman
and
clutching
the
box
yet
more
firmly
under
her
arm
she
hurried
away
once
twice
she
turned
and
shook
her
head
at
the
ragged
woman
who
followed
her
then
with
a
savage
gesture
at
the
two
children
she
disappeared
beyond
miss
terry
straining
eyes
the
poor
woman
and
her
boys
followed
forlornly
at
a
distance
they
really
wanted
it
that
old
noah
ark
exclaimed
miss
terry
in
amazement
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
but
why
did
that
other
creature
keep
the
thing
i
see
only
because
she
found
they
cared
for
it
well
that
is
a
happy
spirit
for
christmas
time
i
should
say
humph
i
did
not
expect
to
find
anything
quite
so
mean
as
chapter
v
miranda
miss
terry
returned
to
the
fireside
fumbled
in
the
box
and
drew
out
a
doll
she
was
an
ugly
doll
with
bruised
waxen
face
of
no
particular
color
her
mop
of
flaxen
hair
was
straggling
and
uneven
much
the
worse
for
the
attention
of
generations
of
moths
she
wore
a
faded
green
silk
dress
in
the
style
of
lincoln
day
and
a
primitive
bonnet
evidently
made
by
childish
hands
she
was
a
strange
figure
with
pale
eyelids
closed
as
miss
terry
dragged
her
from
the
box
but
when
she
was
set
upright
the
lids
snapped
open
and
a
pair
of
bright
blue
eyes
looked
straight
into
those
of
miss
terry
it
was
so
sudden
that
the
lady
nearly
gasped
miranda
she
exclaimed
it
is
old
miranda
i
have
not
thought
of
her
for
years
she
held
the
doll
at
arm
length
gazing
fixedly
at
her
for
some
minutes
i
can
not
burn
her
she
muttered
at
last
it
would
seem
almost
like
murder
i
do
like
to
throw
her
away
but
i
have
vowed
to
get
rid
of
these
things
and
i
do
it
anyway
yes
i
make
an
experiment
of
her
i
wonder
what
sort
of
trouble
she
will
cause
not
even
miss
terry
could
think
of
seeing
old
miranda
lying
exposed
to
the
winter
night
she
found
a
piece
of
paper
rolled
up
the
doll
in
a
neat
package
and
tied
it
with
red
string
it
was
to
look
upon
entirely
a
tempting
package
once
more
she
stole
down
the
steps
and
hesitated
where
to
leave
miranda
not
on
the
sidewalk
for
some
reason
that
seemed
impossible
but
near
the
foot
of
the
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
front
door
she
deposited
the
doll
the
white
package
shone
out
plainly
in
the
illuminated
street
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
readily
seen
with
a
quite
unexplainable
interest
miss
terry
watched
to
see
what
would
happen
to
miranda
she
waited
for
some
time
the
street
seemed
deserted
miss
terry
caught
the
faint
sound
of
singing
the
choristers
were
passing
through
a
neighboring
street
and
doubtless
all
wayfarers
within
hearing
of
their
voices
were
following
in
their
wake
she
was
thoroughly
interested
in
her
grim
joke
but
she
was
becoming
impatient
were
there
to
be
no
more
passers
must
the
doll
stay
there
unreclaimed
until
morning
presently
she
became
aware
of
a
child
figure
drawing
near
it
was
a
little
girl
of
about
ten
very
shabbily
dressed
with
tangled
yellow
curls
hanging
over
her
shoulders
there
was
something
familiar
about
her
appearance
miss
terry
could
not
say
what
it
was
she
came
hurrying
along
the
sidewalk
with
a
preoccupied
air
and
seemed
about
to
pass
the
steps
without
seeing
the
package
lying
there
but
just
as
she
was
opposite
the
window
her
eye
caught
the
gleam
of
the
white
paper
she
paused
she
looked
at
it
eagerly
it
was
such
a
tempting
package
both
as
to
its
size
and
shape
she
went
closer
and
bent
down
to
examine
it
she
took
it
into
her
bare
little
hands
and
seemed
to
squeeze
it
gently
there
is
no
mistaking
the
contours
of
a
doll
however
well
it
may
be
enveloped
in
paper
wrappings
the
child
eyes
grew
more
and
more
eager
she
glanced
behind
her
furtively
she
looked
up
and
down
the
street
then
with
a
sudden
intuition
she
looked
straight
ahead
up
the
flight
of
steps
illustration
she
looked
up
and
down
the
street
miss
terry
read
her
mind
accurately
she
was
thinking
that
probably
the
doll
belonged
in
that
house
some
one
must
have
dropped
the
package
while
going
out
or
in
would
she
ring
the
bell
and
return
it
miss
terry
had
not
thought
of
that
possibility
but
she
shook
her
head
and
her
lip
curled
return
it
of
course
not
ragged
children
do
not
usually
return
promising
packages
which
they
have
found
even
on
christmas
eve
look
now
once
more
the
child
glanced
stealthily
behind
her
up
and
down
the
street
once
more
she
looked
up
at
the
dark
house
before
her
the
only
black
spot
in
a
wreath
of
brilliancy
she
did
not
see
the
face
peering
at
her
through
the
curtains
a
face
which
scanned
her
own
half
wistfully
what
was
to
become
of
miranda
the
little
girl
thrust
the
package
under
her
ragged
coat
and
ran
away
down
the
street
as
fast
as
her
legs
could
take
her
a
thief
cried
miss
terry
that
is
the
climax
i
have
detected
a
child
taking
what
she
knew
did
not
belong
to
her
on
christmas
eve
where
are
all
their
sunday
school
lessons
and
their
social
improvement
classes
i
knew
it
this
christmas
spirit
that
one
hears
so
much
about
is
nothing
but
an
empty
sham
i
have
proved
it
to
my
satisfaction
i
will
burn
the
rest
of
these
toys
every
one
of
them
and
then
go
to
bed
it
is
too
disgusting
she
was
a
child
too
poor
old
miranda
with
something
like
a
sigh
miss
terry
strode
back
to
the
fire
where
the
play
box
stood
gaping
she
had
made
but
a
small
inroad
upon
its
treasures
she
threw
herself
listlessly
into
the
chair
and
began
to
pull
over
the
things
broken
games
and
animals
dolls
dresses
painfully
tailored
by
unskilled
fingers
disjointed
members
sorry
relics
of
past
pleasures
one
by
one
miss
terry
seized
them
between
disdainful
thumb
and
finger
and
tossed
them
into
the
fire
her
face
showed
not
a
qualm
at
parting
with
these
childhood
treasures
only
the
stern
sense
of
a
good
housekeeper
duty
fulfilled
with
queer
contortions
the
bits
writhed
on
the
coals
and
finally
flared
into
dissolution
vanishing
up
chimney
in
a
shower
of
sparks
to
the
heaven
of
spent
toys
chapter
vi
the
christmas
angel
almost
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
miss
terry
fingers
closed
about
a
small
object
once
more
she
drew
out
the
angel
which
had
so
excited
the
wonder
of
norah
when
once
before
that
evening
it
had
come
to
light
miss
terry
held
it
up
and
looked
at
it
with
the
same
expression
on
her
face
half
tender
half
contemptuous
the
christmas
angel
she
murmured
involuntarily
as
she
had
done
before
and
again
there
flashed
through
her
mind
a
vivid
picture
it
was
the
day
before
christmas
fifty
years
earlier
she
and
her
brother
tom
were
trimming
the
christmas
tree
in
this
very
library
she
saw
tom
in
a
white
piqué
suit
with
short
socks
that
were
always
slipping
down
his
fat
legs
she
saw
herself
in
a
white
dress
and
blue
ribbons
pouting
in
a
corner
they
had
been
quarreling
about
the
christmas
tree
disputing
as
to
which
of
them
should
light
the
first
candle
when
the
time
arrived
then
their
mother
came
to
them
smiling
a
lady
who
seemed
not
to
notice
the
red
faces
and
the
tears
she
put
something
into
tom
hand
saying
this
is
the
christmas
angel
of
peace
and
hang
it
on
the
tree
children
so
that
it
may
shed
a
blessing
on
all
who
come
here
to
give
and
to
receive
how
lovely
and
pink
it
looked
in
tom
hand
little
angelina
had
thought
it
the
most
beautiful
thing
she
had
ever
seen
and
holy
too
as
if
it
had
some
blessed
charm
fiddlestick
what
queer
fancies
children
have
miss
terry
remembered
how
a
strange
thrill
had
crept
through
angelina
as
she
gazed
at
it
then
she
and
tom
looked
at
each
other
and
were
ashamed
of
their
quarrel
suddenly
tom
held
out
the
angel
to
his
sister
you
hang
it
on
the
tree
angelina
he
said
magnanimously
i
know
you
want
to
but
she
little
fool
she
too
had
a
fit
of
generosity
no
you
hang
it
tom
you
taller
she
said
i
hang
it
at
the
very
top
of
the
tree
he
replied
nothing
loath
eagerly
he
mounted
the
while
angelina
watched
him
enviously
thinking
how
clumsy
he
was
and
how
much
better
she
could
do
it
how
funny
and
fat
tom
had
looked
on
top
of
the
ladder
reaching
as
high
as
he
dared
the
ladder
began
to
wobble
and
he
balanced
precariously
while
angelina
clutched
at
his
fat
ankles
with
a
scream
of
fright
but
tom
said
ow
angelina
let
go
my
ankles
you
hurt
now
do
scream
i
sha
fall
do
you
know
that
this
is
the
christmas
angel
and
he
will
never
let
me
get
hurt
on
christmas
eve
swaying
wildly
on
one
toe
tom
had
clutched
at
the
air
at
the
tree
itself
anywhere
for
support
yet
almost
as
if
by
a
miracle
he
did
not
fall
and
the
christmas
angel
was
looking
down
from
the
very
top
of
the
tree
miss
terry
laid
the
little
pink
figure
in
her
lap
and
mused
mother
was
wise
she
sighed
she
knew
how
to
settle
our
quarrels
in
those
days
perhaps
if
she
had
still
been
here
things
would
have
gone
differently
tom
might
not
have
left
me
for
good
she
emphasized
the
words
with
a
nod
as
if
arguing
against
something
again
she
took
up
the
christmas
angel
and
looked
earnestly
at
it
could
it
be
that
tears
were
glistening
in
her
eyes
certainly
not
with
a
sudden
sniff
and
jerk
of
the
shoulders
she
leaned
forward
holding
the
angel
towards
the
fire
this
should
follow
the
other
useless
toys
but
something
seemed
to
stay
her
hand
she
drew
back
hesitated
then
rose
to
her
feet
i
ca
burn
it
she
said
it
no
use
i
ca
burn
it
but
i
want
to
see
the
thing
around
i
will
put
this
out
on
the
sidewalk
too
possibly
this
may
be
different
and
do
some
good
to
somebody
she
wrapped
the
shawl
about
her
shoulders
and
once
more
ran
down
the
steps
she
left
the
angel
face
upward
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
and
retreated
quickly
to
the
house
as
she
opened
the
door
to
enter
she
caught
the
distant
chorus
of
fresh
young
voices
singing
in
a
neighboring
square
angels
from
the
realms
of
glory
wing
your
flight
all
the
earth
when
she
took
her
place
behind
the
curtain
she
was
trembling
a
little
she
could
not
guess
why
but
now
she
watched
with
renewed
eagerness
what
was
to
be
the
fate
of
the
christmas
angel
would
he
fall
into
the
right
hands
and
be
hung
upon
some
christmas
tree
ere
morning
would
he
miss
terry
held
her
breath
a
man
was
staggering
along
the
street
toward
her
he
whistled
noisily
a
vulgar
song
as
he
reeled
from
curb
to
railing
threatening
to
fall
at
every
step
a
drunken
man
on
christmas
eve
miss
terry
felt
a
great
loathing
for
him
he
was
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
now
he
was
close
upon
the
angel
would
he
see
it
or
would
he
tread
upon
it
in
his
disgusting
blindness
yes
no
he
saw
the
little
pink
image
lying
on
the
bricks
and
with
a
lurch
forward
bent
to
examine
it
miss
terry
flattened
her
nose
against
the
pane
eagerly
she
expected
to
see
him
fall
upon
the
angel
bodily
but
no
he
righted
himself
with
a
whoop
of
drunken
mirth
angel
she
heard
him
croak
with
maudlin
accent
pink
angel
begorrah
what
doin
eh
whoop
go
back
to
sky
angel
and
lifting
a
brutal
foot
he
kicked
the
image
into
the
street
then
with
a
shriek
of
laughter
he
staggered
away
out
of
sight
miss
terry
found
herself
trembling
with
indignation
the
idea
he
had
kicked
the
christmas
angel
the
very
angel
that
tom
had
hung
on
their
tree
it
was
sacrilege
or
at
least
fiddlestick
miss
terry
mind
was
growing
confused
she
had
a
sudden
impulse
to
rescue
the
toy
from
being
trampled
into
filthiness
the
fire
was
better
than
that
she
hurried
down
the
steps
into
the
street
forgetting
her
shawl
she
sought
in
the
snow
and
snatched
the
pink
morsel
to
safety
straight
to
the
fire
she
carried
it
and
once
more
held
it
to
the
flames
but
again
she
found
it
impossible
to
burn
the
thing
once
twice
she
tried
but
each
time
something
seemed
to
clutch
back
her
wrist
at
last
she
shrugged
impatiently
and
laid
the
angel
on
the
mantelpiece
beside
the
square
old
marble
clock
which
marked
the
hour
of
eight
well
i
wo
burn
it
she
reflected
somehow
i
ca
do
it
just
now
i
do
see
what
has
got
into
me
but
i
will
yes
i
will
she
sat
down
in
the
armchair
and
fumbled
in
the
old
play
box
for
the
remaining
scraps
there
were
but
a
few
meaningless
bits
of
ribbon
and
gauze
with
the
end
of
a
christmas
candle
the
survivor
of
some
past
festival
burned
on
some
tree
in
the
past
all
these
but
the
last
she
tossed
into
the
fire
where
they
made
a
final
protesting
blaze
the
fell
to
the
floor
unnoticed
there
that
is
the
last
of
the
stuff
she
exclaimed
with
grim
satisfaction
shaking
the
dust
from
her
black
silk
skirt
it
is
all
gone
now
thank
heaven
and
i
can
go
to
bed
in
peace
no
i
forgot
norah
i
suppose
i
must
sit
up
and
wait
for
her
bother
the
girl
she
ought
to
be
in
by
now
what
can
she
find
to
amuse
her
all
this
time
christmas
eve
fiddlestick
but
i
have
got
rid
of
a
lot
of
rubbish
and
that
is
worth
something
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
clasped
her
hands
over
her
breast
with
a
sigh
she
felt
strangely
weary
her
eyes
sought
the
clock
once
more
and
doing
so
rested
upon
the
christmas
angel
lying
beside
it
she
frowned
and
closed
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
sight
with
its
haunting
memories
and
suggestions
chapter
vii
before
the
fire
suddenly
there
was
a
volume
of
sound
outside
and
a
great
brightness
filled
the
room
miss
terry
opened
her
eyes
the
fire
was
burning
red
but
a
yellow
light
as
from
thousands
of
candles
shone
in
at
the
window
and
there
was
the
sound
of
singing
the
sweetest
singing
that
miss
terry
had
ever
heard
an
angel
of
the
lord
came
down
and
glory
shone
around
the
words
seemed
chanted
by
the
voices
of
young
angels
miss
terry
passed
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
glanced
at
the
clock
but
what
the
hour
was
she
never
noticed
for
her
gaze
was
filled
with
something
else
beside
the
clock
in
the
spot
where
she
had
laid
it
a
few
minutes
before
was
the
christmas
angel
but
now
instead
of
lying
helplessly
on
its
back
it
was
standing
on
rosy
feet
with
arms
outstretched
toward
her
over
its
head
fluttered
gauzy
wings
from
under
the
yellow
hair
which
rippled
over
the
shoulders
two
blue
eyes
beamed
kindly
upon
her
and
the
mouth
widened
into
the
sweetest
smile
peace
on
earth
to
men
of
cried
the
angel
and
the
tone
of
his
speech
was
music
yet
quite
natural
and
thrilling
miss
terry
stared
hard
at
the
angel
and
rubbed
her
eyes
saying
to
herself
fiddlestick
i
am
dreaming
but
she
could
not
rub
away
the
vision
when
she
opened
her
eyes
the
angel
still
stood
tiptoe
on
the
smiling
at
her
and
shaking
his
golden
head
angelina
said
the
angel
softly
and
miss
terry
trembled
to
hear
her
name
thus
spoken
for
the
first
time
in
years
angelina
you
do
not
want
to
believe
your
own
eyes
do
you
but
i
am
real
more
real
than
the
things
you
see
every
day
you
must
believe
in
me
i
am
the
christmas
angel
i
know
it
miss
terry
voice
was
hoarse
and
unmanageable
as
of
one
in
a
nightmare
i
remember
you
remember
repeated
the
angel
yes
you
remember
the
day
when
you
and
tom
hung
me
on
the
christmas
tree
you
were
a
sweet
little
girl
then
with
blue
eyes
and
yellow
curls
you
believed
the
christmas
story
and
loved
santa
claus
then
you
were
simple
and
affectionate
and
generous
and
happy
fiddlestick
miss
terry
tried
to
say
but
the
word
would
not
come
now
you
have
lost
the
old
belief
and
the
old
love
went
on
the
angel
now
you
have
studied
books
and
read
wise
men
sayings
you
understand
the
higher
criticism
and
the
higher
charity
and
the
higher
egoism
you
believe
in
mere
giving
you
do
believe
in
the
christmas
economics
you
know
better
but
are
you
happy
dear
angelina
again
miss
terry
thrilled
at
the
sound
of
her
name
so
sweetly
spoken
but
she
answered
nothing
the
angel
replied
for
her
no
you
are
not
happy
because
you
have
cut
yourself
off
from
the
things
that
bring
folk
together
in
peace
and
at
this
holy
time
where
are
your
friends
where
is
your
brother
you
are
still
hard
and
unforgiving
to
tom
you
refused
to
see
him
though
he
wrote
so
boyishly
so
humbly
and
affectionately
you
have
not
tried
to
make
any
soul
happy
you
do
believe
in
the
christmas
spirit
there
is
such
a
word
as
fiddlestick
whatever
it
may
mean
but
miss
mind
and
tongue
were
unable
to
form
it
the
christmas
spirit
continued
the
angel
what
is
life
worth
if
one
can
not
believe
in
the
christmas
spirit
with
a
powerful
effort
miss
terry
shook
off
her
nightmare
sufficiently
to
say
the
christmas
spirit
is
no
real
thing
i
have
proved
it
it
is
not
real
it
is
a
humbug
not
real
a
humbug
repeated
the
angel
softly
and
you
have
proved
it
angelina
this
very
night
miss
terry
nodded
i
know
what
you
have
done
said
the
angel
i
know
very
well
how
keen
you
were
how
clever
you
made
a
test
of
chance
to
prove
your
point
again
miss
terry
nodded
with
complacency
what
knowledge
of
the
world
what
grasp
of
human
nature
commented
the
angel
smiling
it
is
like
you
mere
mortals
to
say
will
make
my
test
in
my
own
way
if
certain
things
happen
i
shall
foresee
what
the
result
must
be
if
certain
other
things
happen
i
shall
know
that
i
am
right
events
fall
out
as
you
expect
and
you
smile
with
satisfaction
feeling
your
wisdom
justified
it
ought
to
make
you
happy
but
does
it
miss
terry
regarded
the
angel
doubtfully
look
now
he
went
on
holding
up
a
rosy
finger
you
are
so
you
are
so
unimaginative
you
do
not
dream
beyond
the
thing
you
see
you
judge
the
tale
finished
while
the
best
has
yet
to
be
told
and
you
stake
your
faith
your
hope
your
charity
upon
this
blind
human
judgment
which
is
mere
chance
miss
terry
opened
her
lips
to
say
i
saw
but
the
angel
interrupted
her
you
saw
but
the
beginning
he
said
you
saw
but
the
first
page
of
each
history
shall
i
turn
over
the
leaves
and
let
you
read
what
really
happened
shall
i
help
you
to
see
the
whole
truth
instead
of
a
part
on
this
night
holy
truth
which
is
of
heaven
comes
for
all
men
to
see
and
to
believe
look
chapter
viii
jack
again
the
christmas
angel
gently
waved
his
hand
to
and
fro
gradually
as
miss
terry
sat
back
in
her
chair
the
library
grew
dark
or
rather
things
faded
into
an
indistinguishable
blur
then
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
sitting
at
a
theatre
gazing
at
a
great
stage
but
at
this
theatre
there
was
nothing
about
her
nothing
between
her
and
the
place
where
things
were
happening
first
she
saw
two
little
ragamuffins
quarreling
over
something
in
the
snow
she
recognized
them
they
were
the
two
jewish
boys
who
had
picked
up
the
an
officer
appeared
and
they
ran
away
the
bigger
boy
having
possession
of
the
toy
the
smaller
one
with
fists
in
his
eyes
bawling
with
disappointment
miss
terry
lips
curled
with
the
cynical
disgust
which
she
had
felt
when
first
witnessing
this
scene
but
a
sweet
voice
and
she
knew
it
was
the
angel
whispered
in
her
ear
wait
and
see
she
watched
the
two
boys
run
through
the
streets
until
they
came
to
a
dark
corner
there
the
little
fellow
caught
up
with
the
other
and
once
more
the
struggle
began
it
was
a
hard
and
bloody
fight
but
this
time
the
victory
was
with
the
smaller
lad
who
used
his
fists
and
feet
like
an
enraged
animal
until
the
other
howled
for
mercy
and
handed
over
the
disputed
toy
whatcher
want
it
fer
sam
he
blubbered
as
he
saw
it
go
into
the
little
fellow
pocket
mind

own
business

just

it
answered
sam
surlily
betcher
i
know
taunted
the
bigger
boy
betcher
yer
do
do
do
another
fight
seemed
imminent
but
wisdom
prevailed
with
sammy
he
would
not
challenge
fate
a
third
time
come
on
then
and
see
he
grunted
and
ike
followed
off
the
two
trudged
through
the
brilliantly
lighted
streets
until
they
came
to
a
part
of
the
city
where
the
ways
were
narrower
and
dark
huh
knowed
you
was
comin
here
commented
ike
as
they
turned
into
a
grim
dirty
alley
little
sam
growled
did
apparently
as
a
matter
of
habit
did
reasserted
ike
just
where
i
was
comin
myself
sam
turned
to
him
with
a
grin
was
yer
now
by
ai
that
funny
i
thought
of
it
right
off
sure
same
here
they
both
burst
into
a
guffaw
and
executed
an
impromptu
of
delight
they
were
at
the
door
of
a
tenement
house
with
steep
stairs
leading
into
darkness
up
three
flights
pounded
the
two
pairs
of
heavy
boots
till
they
reached
a
door
whence
issued
the
clatter
of
a
and
the
voices
of
children
sam
stood
on
the
threshold
grinning
debonairly
with
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
ike
peered
over
his
shoulder
also
grinning
it
was
a
meagre
room
into
which
they
gazed
a
room
the
chief
furniture
of
which
seemed
to
be
babies
two
little
ones
sprawled
on
the
floor
a
third
tiny
tot
lay
in
a
carriage
beside
the
door
a
pale
woman
was
running
the
machine
on
the
cot
bed
was
crumpled
a
fragile
little
fellow
of
about
five
and
a
small
pair
of
crutches
lay
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
when
the
two
boys
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
woman
stopped
her
machine
and
the
children
set
up
a
howl
of
pleasure
sammy
ikey
cried
the
woman
smiling
a
wan
welcome
as
the
babies
crept
and
toddled
toward
the
newcomers
where
ye
come
from
been
to
see
the
shops
and
the
lights
in
the
swell
houses
answered
sammy
with
a
grimace
gee
ai
they
wastin
candles
to
beat
the
cars
enough
to
last
a
family
a
whole
year
muttered
ike
with
disgust
the
woman
sighed

ai
wasted

said
how

to
finish
this
job

difference

all
but
joe
i
wish

had
something
for
joe

for

said
sammy
unexpectedly
the
face
of
the
pale
little
cripple
lighted
what
is
it
he
asked
eagerly
oh
what
is
it
a
real
christmas
present
for
me
naw
it
ai
a
christmas
present
said
sam

volunteered
ikey
with
a
grin
sam
looked
at
him
with
a
frown
of
rebuke
it
just
a
he
said
and
it
did
cost
a
cent
i
did
buy
it
i
we
found
it

it
in
the
street
joe
eyes
shone
yah
the
boys
nodded
oh

a
christmas
present
cried
joe
santa
claus

knew

had
any
chimney
in
this
house
and
he
sent
you
kind
kind
boys
to
bring
it
to
me
the
two
urchins
looked
sideways
at
each
other
but
said
nothing
presently
sam
drew
out
the
box
from
his
pocket
and
tried
to
thrust
it
into
hand

give
it
to
he
said
you
the
biggest
naw
you
give
it
you
found
it
protested
ike
ah
big
fool
there
was
a
tussle
and
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
past
unpleasantness
was
to
be
repeated
from
an
opposite
cause
but
joe
voice
settled
the
dispute
oh
sammy
please
he
cried
i
ca
wait
another
minute
do
please
give
it
to
me
now
at
these
words
sam
stepped
forward
without
further
argument
and
laid
the
box
on
the
bed
in
front
of
the
little
cripple
the
babies
crowded
about
the
mother
left
her
machine
and
stood
smiling
faintly
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
joe
pressed
the
spring
out
sprang
the
with
the
same
red
nose
the
same
leer
the
same
roguish
eyes
which
had
surprised
the
children
of
fifty
years
ago
illustration
out
sprang
the
jack
was
always
sure
of
his
audience
my
how
they
screamed
and
begged
joe
to
do
it
again
and
as
for
joe
he
lay
back
on
his
pillow
and
laughed
and
laughed
as
though
he
would
never
stop
it
was
the
first
jack
any
of
them
had
seen
tears
stood
in
the
mother
eyes
well
she
said
it
as
good
as
a
play
to
see
him
joe
has
laughed
like
that
for
months
you
boys
have
done
him
lots
of
good
i
would
wonder
if
it
helped
him
get
well
if
you
was
christians
i
say
you
showed
the
real
christmas
spirit
but
lord
perhaps
ye
do
all
the
same
i
dunno
sam
and
ike
were
so
busy
playing
with
the
children
that
they
did
not
hear
gradually
the
tenement
house
faded
and
became
a
blur
before
miss
eyes
once
more
she
saw
the
before
her
and
the
christmas
angel
with
outstretched
arms
waving
to
and
fro
you
see
he
said
you
did
not
guess
all
the
pleasure
that
was
shut
up
in
that
box
with
old
jack
did
you
miss
terry
shook
her
head
and
you
see
how
different
it
all
was
from
what
you
thought
now
let
us
see
what
became
of
the
dog
the
flanton
dog
miss
terry
amended
the
phrase
under
her
breath
it
seemed
so
natural
to
use
tom
word
yes
the
flanton
dog
the
angel
smiled
what
do
you
think
became
of
him
i
saw
what
became
of
him
said
miss
terry
bob
cooper
threw
him
under
an
automobile
and
he
was
crushed
flatter
than
a
pancake
then
you
left
the
window
said
the
angel
in
your
human
way
you
assumed
that
this
was
the
end
but
wait
and
see
once
more
the
room
darkened
and
blurred
and
miss
terry
looked
out
upon
past
events
as
upon
a
busy
stage
chapter
ix
the
dog
again
she
saw
the
snowy
street
into
which
from
the
tip
of
his
stick
bob
cooper
had
just
tossed
the
flanton
dog
she
saw
what
she
had
not
seen
before
the
woman
and
child
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
she
saw
the
baby
stretch
out
wistful
hands
after
the
dog
lying
in
the
snow
then
an
automobile
honked
past
and
she
felt
again
the
thrill
of
horror
as
it
ran
over
the
poor
old
toy
at
the
same
moment
the
child
screamed
and
she
saw
it
point
tearfully
at
the
flanton
tragedy
the
mother
who
had
seen
nothing
of
all
this
stooped
and
spoke
to
him
reprovingly
what
the
matter
johnnie
she
said
sh
do
make
such
a
noise
here
we
are
at
wales
gate
and
you
must
make
a
fuss
now
be
a
good
boy
and
wait
here
till
mother
comes
out
she
rang
the
area
bell
and
stood
basket
in
hand
waiting
to
be
admitted
but
johnnie
gazed
at
one
spot
in
the
street
with
eyes
full
of
tears
and
with
now
and
then
a
sob
gurgling
from
his
throat
he
could
not
forget
what
he
had
seen
the
door
opened
for
the
mother
who
disappeared
inside
the
house
with
one
last
command
to
the
child
now
be
a
good
boy
johnnie
i
be
back
in
half
a
minute
hardly
was
she
out
of
sight
when
johnnie
started
through
the
snowdrift
toward
the
middle
of
the
street
with
difficulty
he
lifted
his
little
legs
out
of
the
deep
snow
now
and
then
he
stumbled
and
fell
into
the
soft
mass
but
he
rose
only
the
more
determined
upon
his
errand
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
wreck
of
the
flanton
dog
bob
cooper
who
was
idly
strolling
up
and
down
the
block
smoking
a
cigarette
as
he
watched
the
flitting
girlish
shadows
in
a
certain
window
opposite
saw
the
child
frantic
struggles
in
the
snow
and
was
intensely
amused
bah
jove
he
chuckled
i
believe
he
after
the
wretched
dawg
that
i
tossed
over
there
with
my
stick
fahncy
it
and
carelessly
he
puffed
a
whiff
of
smoke
at
last
the
baby
reached
the
middle
of
the
street
and
stooped
to
pick
up
the
battered
toy
it
was
flattened
and
shapeless
but
the
child
clasped
it
tenderly
and
began
to
coo
softly
to
it
bah
jove
repeated
cooper
fahncy
caring
so
much
about
anything
poor
kid
perhaps
that
is
all
the
christmas
he
will
have
he
blew
a
thoughtful
puff
through
his
nose
christmas
eve
the
thought
flashed
through
his
mind
with
a
new
appeal
just
then
came
a
sudden
honk
an
automobile
had
turned
the
corner
and
was
coming
up
at
full
speed
it
was
the
same
machine
which
had
passed
a
few
minutes
earlier
in
the
opposite
direction
hi
there
cooper
yelled
to
the
child
but
the
latter
was
sitting
in
the
snow
in
the
middle
of
the
street
rocking
back
and
forth
with
the
flanton
dog
in
his
arms
there
was
scarcely
time
for
action
bob
dropped
his
cigarette
and
his
cane
made
one
leap
into
the
street
and
another
to
the
child
and
by
the
impact
of
his
body
threw
the
baby
into
the
drift
at
the
curb
with
a
horrified
the
automobile
passed
over
the
young
man
who
lay
senseless
in
the
snow
illustration
bob
cooper
saves
the
baby
he
was
not
killed
miss
terry
saw
him
taken
to
his
home
close
by
where
his
broken
leg
was
set
and
his
bruises
attended
to
she
saw
him
lying
bandaged
and
white
on
his
bed
when
the
woman
and
her
child
were
brought
to
see
him
johnnie
was
still
clasping
closely
the
unlucky
flanton
dog
well
kid
said
the
young
man
feebly
so
you
saved
the
dog
after
all
o
sir
cried
the
poor
woman
weeping
only
to
think
that
he
would
not
be
here
now
but
for
you
what
a
christmas
that
would
have
been
for
me
you
were
so
good
so
brave
oh
rot
protested
bob
faintly
had
to
do
it
my
fault
anyway
christmas
eve
could
see
a
kid
hurt
on
christmas
eve
he
called
the
attendant
and
asked
for
the
which
had
been
in
his
coat
at
the
time
of
the
accident
putting
it
into
the
woman
hand
he
said
get
johnnie
something
really
jolly
for
christmas
afraid
the
dog
is
about
all
in
get
him
a
new
one
but
johnnie
refused
to
have
a
new
dog
it
was
the
poor
shapeless
flanton
animal
which
remained
the
darling
of
his
heart
for
many
a
moon
all
this
of
past
and
future
miss
terry
knew
through
the
angel
power
when
once
more
the
library
lightened
and
she
saw
the
pink
figure
smiling
at
her
from
the
mantel
she
spoke
of
her
own
accord
it
was
my
fault
because
i
put
the
dog
in
the
way
i
caused
all
that
trouble
trouble
said
the
angel
puzzled
do
you
call
it
do
you
not
see
what
it
has
done
for
that
heartless
youth
it
brought
his
good
moment
perhaps
he
will
be
a
different
man
after
this
and
as
for
the
child
he
was
made
happy
by
something
that
would
otherwise
have
been
wasted
and
he
has
gained
a
friend
who
will
not
forget
him
trouble
and
do
you
think
did
it
he
laughed
knowingly
i
certainly
did
said
miss
terry
firmly
but
it
was
i
yes
the
christmas
spirit
who
put
it
into
your
head
to
do
what
you
did
you
may
not
believe
it
but
so
it
was
you
too
even
you
angelina
could
not
quite
escape
the
influence
of
the
christmas
spirit
and
so
these
things
have
happened
but
now
let
us
see
what
became
of
the
third
experiment
chapter
x
noah
again
in
the
street
of
candles
a
woman
dressed
all
in
black
had
picked
up
the
poor
old
noah
ark
and
was
looking
at
it
wildly
she
was
a
widow
who
had
just
lost
her
only
child
a
little
son
and
she
was
in
a
state
of
morbid
bitterness
bordering
on
distraction
when
the
second
woman
with
the
two
little
ones
came
up
and
begged
for
the
toy
something
hard
and
sullen
and
cruel
rose
in
the
widow
heart
and
she
refused
angrily
to
give
up
the
thing
she
hated
those
two
boys
who
had
been
spared
when
her
own
was
taken
she
would
not
make
them
happy
no
you
shall
not
have
it
she
cried
clutching
the
noah
ark
fiercely
i
will
destroy
it
the
poor
woman
and
the
children
followed
her
wistfully
the
little
boys
were
crying
they
were
cold
and
hungry
and
disappointed
they
had
come
so
near
to
something
pleasant
they
had
almost
been
lucky
but
the
luck
had
passed
over
their
heads
to
another
the
woman
in
mourning
strode
on
rapidly
the
thoughts
within
her
no
less
black
than
the
garments
which
she
wore
she
hated
the
world
she
hated
the
people
who
lived
in
it
she
hated
christmas
time
when
every
one
seemed
merry
except
herself
and
yes
yes
most
of
all
she
hated
children
she
clenched
her
teeth
wickedly
her
mind
reeled
suddenly
somewhere
a
chorus
of
happy
voices
began
to
sing
the
words
of
an
old
carol
holy
night
peaceful
night
all
is
dark
save
the
light
yonder
where
they
sweet
vigil
keep
the
babe
who
in
silent
sleep
rests
in
heavenly
peace
softly
and
sweetly
the
childish
voices
ascended
from
the
street
the
woman
in
black
stopped
short
breathing
hard
she
saw
the
band
of
choristers
standing
in
a
group
on
the
sidewalk
and
in
the
snow
their
hats
pulled
down
over
their
eyes
their
collars
turned
up
around
their
ears
their
hands
deep
in
pockets
in
their
midst
rose
the
tall
wooden
cross
carried
by
a
little
fellow
with
yellow
hair
they
sang
as
simply
and
as
heartily
as
a
flock
of
birds
out
in
the
snow
the
woman
gave
a
great
sob
her
little
lad
had
been
a
choir
boy
perhaps
these
were
his
comrades
the
second
verse
of
the
carol
rang
out
sweetly
holy
night
peaceful
night
only
for
shepherds
sight
came
blest
visions
of
angel
throngs
with
their
loud
hallelujah
songs
saying
jesus
is
come
suddenly
it
seemed
to
the
distracted
mother
that
her
own
boy
voice
blended
with
those
others
he
too
was
singing
in
honor
of
that
child
happy
and
ever
young
he
was
bidding
her
rejoice
in
the
day
which
made
all
childhood
sacred
and
for
his
sake
she
had
been
hating
children
with
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
she
turned
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
poor
mother
and
her
boys
they
were
not
far
behind
huddling
in
the
shadow
the
black
woman
strode
quickly
up
to
them
they
shrank
pitifully
at
her
approach
and
she
felt
the
shame
of
it
they
were
afraid
of
her
here
she
said
thrusting
the
noah
ark
into
the
hands
of
the
larger
boy
take
it
it
belongs
to
you
the
child
took
it
timidly
the
mother
began
to
protest
thanks
trying
to
control
the
shake
in
her
voice
the
dark
lady
spoke
again
have
you
prepared
a
christmas
for
your
children
the
woman
shook
her
head
i
have
nothing
she
sighed
a
roof
over
our
heads
that
all
your
husband
my
man
died
a
month
ago
so
other
folk
had
raw
sorrows
too
the
mourner
had
forgotten
that
there
is
no
one
expecting
you
at
home
again
the
woman
shook
her
head
dolefully
come
with
me
said
the
dark
lady
impulsively
you
shall
be
my
guests
and
i
will
make
a
christmas
for
the
children
the
house
shall
put
off
its
shadow
i
too
will
light
candles
i
have
toys
her
voice
broke
and
clothing
many
things
which
are
being
wasted
that
is
not
right
something
led
you
to
me
or
me
to
you
something
perhaps
it
was
an
angel
whoever
dropped
that
noah
ark
in
the
street
an
angel
might
do
that
i
believe
come
with
me
the
woman
and
her
sons
followed
her
rejoicing
greatly
in
the
midst
of
their
wonder
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
through
which
miss
terry
saw
once
more
the
christmas
angel
she
wiped
them
hastily
but
still
the
angel
seemed
to
shine
with
a
fairer
radiance
you
see
was
all
he
said
and
miss
terry
bowed
her
head
she
began
to
understand
chapter
xi
miranda
again
once
more
on
the
wings
of
vision
miss
terry
was
out
in
the
snowy
street
she
was
following
the
fleet
steps
of
a
little
girl
who
carried
a
package
under
her
arm
miss
terry
knew
that
she
was
learning
the
fate
of
her
old
doll
miranda
whom
her
own
hands
had
thrust
out
into
a
cold
world
poor
miranda
after
all
these
years
to
become
the
property
of
a
thief
mary
was
the
little
thief
name
hugging
the
tempting
package
close
mary
ran
and
ran
until
she
was
out
of
breath
her
one
thought
was
to
get
as
far
as
possible
from
the
place
where
the
bundle
had
lain
for
she
suspected
that
the
steps
where
she
had
found
it
led
up
to
the
doll
home
that
was
why
in
her
own
eyes
also
she
was
a
little
thief
but
now
she
had
run
so
far
and
had
turned
so
many
corners
that
she
could
not
find
her
way
back
if
she
would
there
was
triumph
in
the
thought
mary
chuckled
to
herself
as
she
stopped
running
and
began
to
walk
leisurely
in
the
neighborhood
with
which
she
was
more
familiar
she
pinched
the
package
gently
yes
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
it
was
a
doll
not
a
very
large
doll
but
mary
reflected
that
she
had
never
thought
she
should
care
for
a
large
doll
undoubtedly
it
was
a
very
nice
one
had
she
not
found
it
in
a
swell
part
of
the
city
on
the
steps
of
a
house
mary
gloated
over
the
doll
as
she
fancied
it
with
real
hair
and
eyes
that
opened
and
shut
with
four
little
white
teeth
and
hands
with
dimples
in
the
knuckles
she
had
seen
such
dolls
in
the
windows
of
the
big
shops
but
she
had
never
hoped
to
have
one
for
her
very
own
maybe
it
will
have
on
a
blue
silk
dress
and
white
kid
shoes
like
that
one
i
saw
this
morning
she
mused
rapturously
she
pinched
the
spot
where
she
fancied
the
doll
feet
ought
to
be
yes
she
got
shoes
sure
enough
i
bet
they
white
too
they
white
oh
what
fun
i
shall
have
with
her
she
hugged
the
doll
fondly
if
uncle
and
aunt
do
take
her
away
the
sudden
thought
made
her
stand
still
in
horror
they
sold
little
clock
for
rum
she
said
bitterly
they
sold
the
ring
with
the
red
stone
that
father
gave
me
on
my
birthday
when
i
was
seven
they
sold
the
presents
that
i
got
at
sunday
school
last
year
oh
would
it
be
dreadful
if
they
should
sell
my
new
doll
and
i
know
they
will
want
to
if
they
see
her
she
squeezed
the
bundle
closer
with
the
prescient
pang
of
parting
maybe
they
be
out
somewhere
with
this
faint
hope
she
reached
the
tenement
and
crept
up
the
dingy
stairs
she
peeped
in
at
the
door
alas
her
uncle
and
aunt
were
in
the
kitchen
through
which
she
had
to
pass
they
had
company
some
men
and
women
and
there
were
a
jug
and
glasses
on
the
table
before
them
mary
heart
sank
but
she
nodded
bravely
to
the
company
and
tried
to
slip
through
the
crowd
to
the
other
room
but
her
aunt
was
quick
to
see
that
she
carried
something
under
her
coat
what
you
got
there
a
christmas
present
she
sneered
mary
flushed
no
she
said
slowly
just
something
i
found
found
hello
what
is
it
a
package
her
uncle
advanced
and
snatched
it
from
her
please
pleaded
mary
please
i
found
it
it
is
mine
i
think
it
is
only
a
doll
a
doll
huh
who
needs
a
doll
hiccoughed
her
uncle
we
want
something
more
to
drink
we
sell
it
a
bellow
of
laughter
resounded
through
the
room
the
paper
being
torn
roughly
away
poor
miranda
stood
revealed
in
all
her
faded
beauty
the
pallid
waxen
face
straggling
hair
and
dress
presented
a
sorry
sight
to
the
greedy
eyes
which
had
expected
to
find
something
exchangeable
for
drink
a
sorry
sight
she
was
to
mary
who
had
hoped
for
something
so
much
lovelier
a
flush
of
disappointment
came
into
her
cheek
and
tears
to
her
eyes
here
take
your
old
doll
said
her
uncle
roughly
thrusting
it
into
her
arms
take
your
old
doll
and
get
away
with
her
if
that
the
best
you
can
find
you
better
something
next
time
steal
something
had
she
not
in
fact
stolen
it
mary
knew
very
well
that
she
had
and
she
flushed
pinker
yet
to
think
what
a
fool
she
had
made
of
herself
for
nothing
she
took
the
despised
doll
and
retreated
into
the
other
room
followed
by
a
chorus
of
jeers
and
comments
she
banged
the
door
behind
her
and
sat
down
with
poor
miranda
on
her
knees
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
she
had
so
longed
for
a
beautiful
doll
it
did
seem
too
cruel
that
when
she
found
one
it
should
turn
out
to
be
so
ugly
she
seized
poor
miranda
and
shook
her
fiercely
you
horrid
old
thing
she
said
ai
you
ashamed
to
fool
me
so
you
ashamed
to
make
me
think
you
was
a
lovely
doll
with
pretty
and
kid
shoes
ai
you
she
shook
miranda
again
until
her
eyeballs
rattled
in
her
head
the
doll
fell
to
the
floor
and
lay
there
with
closed
eyes
her
face
was
pallid
and
ghastly
her
bonnet
had
fallen
off
and
her
hair
stuck
out
wildly
in
every
direction
her
legs
were
doubled
under
her
in
the
most
helpless
fashion
she
was
the
forlornest
figure
of
a
doll
imaginable
presently
mary
drew
her
hands
away
from
her
eyes
and
looked
down
at
miranda
there
was
something
in
the
doll
attitude
as
she
lay
there
which
touched
the
little
girl
heart
once
she
had
seen
a
woman
who
had
been
injured
in
the
street
she
would
never
forget
it
the
poor
creature
eyes
had
been
closed
and
her
face
under
the
fallen
bonnet
was
of
this
same
pasty
color
mary
shuddered
suddenly
she
felt
a
warm
rush
of
pity
for
the
doll
you
poor
old
thing
she
exclaimed
looking
at
miranda
almost
tenderly
i
sorry
i
shook
you
you
look
so
tired
and
sad
and
homesick
i
wonder
if
somebody
is
worrying
about
you
this
minute
it
was
very
wicked
of
me
to
take
you
away
on
christmas
eve
too
i
wish
i
had
left
you
where
i
found
you
maybe
some
little
girl
is
crying
now
because
you
are
lost
mary
stooped
and
lifted
the
doll
gently
upon
her
knees
as
she
took
miranda
up
the
blue
eyes
opened
and
seemed
to
look
full
at
her
miranda
one
beauty
was
her
eyes
mary
felt
her
heart
grow
warmer
and
warmer
toward
the
quaint
stranger
you
have
lovely
eyes
she
murmured
i
think
after
all
you
are
almost
pretty
perhaps
i
should
grow
to
like
you
awfully
you
are
not
a
bit
like
the
doll
i
hoped
to
have
but
that
is
not
your
fault
a
thought
made
her
face
brighten
why
if
you
had
been
a
beautiful
doll
they
would
have
taken
you
away
and
sold
you
for
rum
her
face
expressed
utter
disgust
she
hugged
miranda
close
with
a
sudden
outburst
of
affection
oh
you
dear
old
thing
she
cried
i
am
so
glad
you
are
just
like
this
i
am
so
glad
for
now
i
can
keep
you
always
and
always
and
no
one
will
want
to
take
you
away
from
me
she
rocked
to
and
fro
holding
the
doll
tightly
to
her
heart
mary
was
not
one
to
feel
a
about
anything
i
will
make
you
some
new
dresses
she
said
fingering
the
silk
with
a
puzzled
air
i
wonder
why
your
mother
dressed
you
so
queerly
she
was
not
much
of
a
sewer
if
she
made
this
bonnet
scornfully
she
took
off
the
primitive
bonnet
and
smoothed
out
the
tangled
hair
i
wonder
what
you
have
on
underneath
she
said
with
gentle
fingers
she
began
to
undress
miranda
off
came
the
green
silk
dress
with
its
tight
basque
and
overskirt
off
came
the
ruffled
petticoat
and
little
chemise
edged
with
fine
lace
and
miranda
stood
in
shapeless
ugliness
which
stage
of
evolution
the
doll
of
her
day
had
reached
but
there
was
something
more
around
her
neck
she
wore
a
ribbon
on
the
ribbon
was
a
cardboard
medal
and
on
the
medal
a
childish
hand
had
scratched
the
legend
if
lost
please
return
her
to
her
mother
overlook
terrace
it
was
such
a
card
as
miss
terry
herself
had
worn
in
the
days
when
her
mother
had
first
let
her
and
tom
go
out
on
the
street
without
a
nurse
mary
stared
hard
at
the
bit
of
cardboard
overlook
terrace
yes
that
was
where
she
had
found
the
doll
she
remembered
now
seeing
the
name
on
a
street
corner
what
a
pretty
name
for
a
doll
terry
so
that
was
the
name
of
the
little
girl
who
had
lost
miranda
angelina
must
be
feeling
very
sorry
now
perhaps
she
was
crying
herself
to
sleep
for
it
was
growing
late
her
two
girl
cousins
came
romping
into
the
bedroom
they
had
been
having
a
hilarious
evening
hello
mary
they
cried
we
heard
about
your
great
find
playing
with
your
old
doll
are
you
goin
to
hang
up
her
stockin
and
see
if
santa
claus
will
fill
it
huh
santa
claus
wo
come
to
house
i
guess
mary
had
almost
forgotten
that
it
was
christmas
eve
there
had
been
nothing
in
the
house
to
remind
her
perhaps
angelina
terry
had
hung
up
a
stocking
for
miranda
at
overlook
terrace
but
there
would
be
no
miranda
to
see
it
the
next
morning
her
cousins
teased
her
for
some
time
while
they
undressed
and
mary
grew
sulky
she
sat
in
her
corner
and
answered
them
shortly
but
presently
the
room
was
quiet
for
the
girls
slept
easily
then
mary
crept
into
her
little
cot
with
the
doll
in
her
arms
she
loved
miranda
so
much
that
she
would
never
part
with
her
no
indeed
not
even
though
she
now
knew
where
miranda
belonged
overlook
terrace
the
figures
danced
before
her
eyes
maliciously
she
wished
she
could
forget
them
and
the
thought
of
angelina
terry
kept
coming
to
her
poor
angelina
she
ai
angelina
argued
mary
to
herself
she
angelina
does
she
live
in
a
big
house
in
the
swell
part
of
the
city
i
she
has
hundreds
of
dolls
much
handsomer
than
miranda
and
lots
of
other
toys
i
guess
she
wo
miss
this
one
queer
old
doll
i
guess
let
me
keep
it
if
she
knew
i
had
any
of
my
own
i
guess
it
ought
to
be
my
doll
anyway
i
going
to
keep
her
i
do
believe
angelina
loves
miranda
so
much
as
i
do
she
laid
her
cheek
against
the
doll
cold
waxen
one
and
presently
fell
asleep
but
she
slept
uneasily
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
awoke
and
lay
for
hours
tossing
and
unhappy
in
the
stuffy
little
room
the
clock
struck
one
two
three
at
last
she
gave
a
great
sigh
and
cuddling
miranda
in
her
arms
turned
over
with
peace
in
her
heart
i
will
play
you
are
mine
my
very
own
dollie
for
just
this
one
night
she
whispered
in
miranda
ear
will
be
christmas
day
and
i
will
take
you
back
to
your
little
mother
angelina
terry
i
ca
do
a
mean
thing
at
christmas
time
not
even
for
you
dear
miranda
thereupon
she
fell
into
a
peaceful
sleep
chapter
xii
the
angel
again
will
she
bring
it
back
asked
miss
terry
eagerly
when
once
more
she
found
herself
under
the
gaze
of
the
christmas
angel
he
nodded
brightly
morning
you
will
see
he
said
it
will
prove
that
all
i
have
shown
you
is
really
true
a
pretty
child
said
miss
terry
musingly
a
very
nice
child
indeed
i
believe
she
looks
very
much
as
i
used
to
be
myself
you
see
she
is
not
a
thief
after
all
not
said
the
angel
what
a
pity
that
she
must
live
in
that
sad
home
with
such
terrible
people
a
sensitive
child
like
her
craving
sympathy
and
affection
what
chance
has
she
for
happiness
what
would
you
yourself
have
been
in
surroundings
like
hers
yes
she
is
very
like
what
i
was
of
course
i
shall
let
her
keep
the
doll
miss
terry
hesitated
the
angel
looked
at
her
steadily
and
his
glance
seemed
to
read
her
thoughts
surely
he
said
it
seems
to
belong
to
her
does
it
not
but
is
this
all
i
wonder
if
something
more
does
not
belong
to
her
what
more
asked
miss
terry
shortly
a
home
cried
the
angel
miss
terry
groped
in
her
memory
for
a
scornful
ejaculation
which
she
had
once
been
fond
of
using
but
there
was
no
such
word
to
be
found
instead
there
came
to
her
lips
the
name
mary
the
angel
repeated
it
softly
it
is
a
blessed
name
he
said
blessed
the
roof
that
shelters
a
mary
in
her
need
there
was
a
long
silence
in
which
miss
terry
felt
new
impulses
stirring
within
her
impulses
drawing
her
to
the
child
whose
looks
recalled
her
own
childhood
the
angel
regarded
her
with
beaming
eyes
after
some
time
he
said
quietly
now
let
us
see
what
became
of
your
last
experiment
miss
terry
started
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
been
interrupted
in
pleasant
dreaming
were
the
last
experiment
she
said
i
know
what
became
of
you
here
you
are
yet
more
may
have
happened
than
you
guessed
replied
the
angel
meaningly
i
have
tried
to
show
you
how
often
that
is
the
case
look
again
without
moving
from
her
chair
miss
terry
seemed
to
be
looking
out
on
her
sidewalk
where
so
it
seemed
she
had
just
laid
the
pink
figure
of
the
angel
she
saw
the
drunken
man
approach
she
heard
his
coarse
laugh
saw
his
brutal
movement
as
he
kicked
the
christmas
token
into
the
street
in
sick
disgust
she
saw
him
reel
away
out
of
sight
she
saw
herself
run
down
the
steps
rescue
the
image
and
bring
it
into
the
house
surely
the
story
was
finished
what
more
could
there
be
but
something
bade
her
vision
follow
the
steps
of
the
wretched
man
down
the
street
he
reeled
singing
a
blasphemous
song
with
a
whoop
he
rounded
a
corner
and
ran
into
a
happy
party
which
filled
sidewalk
and
street
as
it
hurried
in
the
direction
from
which
he
came
they
jostled
him
against
the
wall
and
he
grasped
a
railing
to
steady
himself
as
they
swept
by
it
was
the
choir
on
their
way
to
carol
in
the
next
street
before
them
went
the
lifting
high
his
simple
wooden
emblem
illustration
he
grasped
a
railing
to
steady
himself
the
eyes
of
the
drunken
man
caught
sight
of
this
and
wavered
the
presence
of
the
crowd
conveyed
no
meaning
to
his
dazed
brains
but
there
was
something
in
the
familiar
symbol
which
held
his
vision
he
looked
and
crossed
himself
remembering
the
traditions
of
his
childhood
some
of
the
boys
were
humming
as
they
went
the
stirring
strains
of
an
ancient
christmas
march
known
to
all
nations
a
carol
which
began
some
say
as
a
rousing
drinking
chorus
the
familiar
strain
touched
some
chord
in
the
sodden
brain
the
man
gave
a
feeble
whinny
trying
to
follow
the
melody
he
pulled
himself
together
and
lurched
forward
in
a
sudden
impulse
to
join
the
band
of
pilgrims
but
by
the
time
he
had
taken
three
steps
they
had
vanished
miraculously
as
it
seemed
to
him
begorra
they
gone
he
cried
who
were
they
were
they
rale
folks
what
was
it
they
was
singin
he
sank
back
helplessly
on
a
flight
of
steps
he
croaked
in
a
quavering
basso
and
his
tangled
mind
went
through
strange
processes
suddenly
there
came
to
him
in
a
flash
of
exaggerated
memory
the
figure
of
the
christmas
angel
which
not
ten
minutes
earlier
he
had
kicked
into
the
street
a
pious
horror
fell
upon
him
mither
o
mercy
he
cried
again
crossing
himself
what
have
i
been
done
it
was
a
howly
image
an
what
did
i
do
to
ut
lem
me
go
back
an
find
ut
an
take
ut
up
out
av
the
street
greatly
sobered
by
his
fear
he
staggered
down
the
block
and
around
the
corner
to
the
steps
of
miss
terry
house
this
is
the
place
he
mused
i
know
ut
here
where
the
frindly
hild
me
in
its
arrums
i
rimimber
there
was
a
dark
house
forninst

here
where
ut
lay
on
the
sidewalk
all
pink
an
pretty
an
i
kicked
ut
into
the
street
where
is
ut
now
where
gone
howly
mither
here
the
spot
where
ut
fell
look
now
the
shape
of
uts
little
body
and
the
wings
of
ut
in
the
snow
but
is
gone
intirely
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
crossed
himself
again
is
flown
away
he
muttered
is
gone
back
to
hiven
to
tell
mary
mither
o
the
wicked
thing
i
done
this
night
oh
is
a
miracle
that
happened
an
oh
the
wicked
man
i
am
drunk
and
disorderly
on
the
howly
eve
o
come
all
ye
faithful
joyful
and
triumphant
once
more
he
heard
the
familiar
strain
taken
up
lustily
by
many
voices
hear
all
the
world
singin
on
the
way
to
bethlehem
he
said
and
the
stupor
seemed
to
leave
his
brain
he
no
longer
staggered
i
run
an
join
an
i
wo
drink
another
drop
this
night
he
looked
up
at
the
starry
sky
maybe
the
angel
hears
me
maybe
he
help
me
to
keep
straight
it
might
be
my
guardian
angel
himsilf
that
i
treated
so
saints
forgive
me
with
head
bowed
humbly
but
no
longer
reeling
he
moved
away
towards
the
sound
of
music
you
were
his
guardian
angel
said
miss
terry
when
once
more
she
saw
the
figure
on
the
and
she
spoke
with
reverent
gentleness
the
angel
smiled
brightly
the
christmas
spirit
is
a
guardian
angel
to
many
he
said
never
again
despise
me
angelina
never
again
make
light
of
my
influence
never
again
murmured
miss
terry
half
unconsciously
i
wish
it
were
not
too
late
it
is
never
too
late
said
the
christmas
angel
eagerly
as
if
he
read
her
unspoken
thought
oh
never
too
late
angelina
chapter
xiii
the
christmas
candle
suddenly
there
was
a
sound
a
dull
reverberating
sound
it
seemed
to
miss
terry
to
come
from
neither
north
south
east
nor
west
but
from
a
different
world
ah
she
recognized
it
now
it
was
somebody
knocking
on
the
library
door
miss
terry
gave
a
long
sigh
and
drew
herself
up
in
her
chair
it
must
be
norah
just
come
back
she
said
to
herself
i
had
forgotten
norah
completely
it
must
be
shockingly
late
come
in
she
called
as
she
glanced
at
the
clock
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
looked
again
a
few
minutes
after
nine
she
had
thought
it
must
be
midnight
norah
entered
to
find
her
mistress
staring
at
the
mantel
where
the
clock
stood
she
saw
lying
beside
the
clock
the
pink
angel
which
had
fallen
from
the
box
as
she
brought
it
in
the
box
now
empty
by
the
fire
law
miss
she
said
have
you
burned
them
all
up
but
him
i
glad
you
saved
him
he
so
pretty
norah
said
miss
terry
with
an
effort
is
that
clock
right
yes
said
norah
i
set
it
this
morning
i
came
back
as
soon
as
i
could
miss
she
added
apologetically
it
is
that
answered
miss
terry
drawing
her
hand
across
her
forehead
dazedly
i
did
not
mind
your
absence
but
i
thought
it
must
be
later
oh
no
i
would
stay
out
any
later
when
you
was
alone
here
miss
said
norah
penitently
i
felt
ashamed
after
i
had
gone
i
ought
not
to
have
left
you
so
on
christmas
eve
but
oh
miss
the
singing
was
so
beautiful
and
the
houses
looked
so
grand
with
the
candles
in
the
windows
it
is
like
a
holy
night
indeed
miss
terry
stooped
and
picked
up
something
from
the
floor
it
was
the
bit
of
which
had
escaped
the
holocaust
are
the
candles
still
lighted
norah
she
asked
eyeing
the
bit
of
wax
in
her
hand
yes
some
of
them
answered
the
maid
it
is
getting
late
and
a
good
many
have
burned
out
but
some
houses
are
still
as
bright
as
ever
perhaps
it
is
not
too
late
then
murmured
miss
terry
as
if
yielding
a
disputed
point
let
us
hurry
norah
she
rose
and
going
to
the
gently
took
up
the
figure
of
the
angel
while
norah
looked
on
in
amazement
norah
said
miss
terry
with
an
eagerness
which
made
her
voice
tremble
i
want
you
to
hang
the
christmas
angel
in
the
window
there
i
too
have
a
fancy
to
burn
a
candle
if
it
is
not
too
late
i
like
to
have
a
little
share
in
the
christmas
spirit
norah
eyes
lighted
oh
yes
she
said
i
hang
it
right
away
and
i
find
an
empty
spool
to
hold
the
candle
she
bustled
briskly
about
and
presently
in
the
window
appeared
a
little
device
unlike
any
other
in
the
block
against
the
darkness
within
the
figure
of
the
angel
with
arms
outstretched
towards
the
street
shone
in
a
soft
light
from
the
flame
of
a
single
tiny
candle
such
as
blossom
on
christmas
trees
it
caught
the
attention
of
many
who
said
smiling
how
simple
how
pretty
how
quaint
it
is
a
type
of
the
christmas
spirit
which
is
abroad
you
can
feel
it
everywhere
blessing
the
city
for
some
minutes
before
the
candle
was
lighted
a
man
muffled
in
a
heavy
overcoat
had
been
standing
in
a
doorway
opposite
miss
terry
house
he
was
tall
and
grizzled
and
his
face
was
sad
he
stared
up
at
the
gloomy
windows
the
only
oblongs
of
blackness
in
the
illuminated
block
and
he
shivered
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
same
as
ever
he
said
to
himself
i
might
have
known
she
would
never
change
any
one
else
on
christmas
eve
after
the
letter
i
wrote
her
would
have
softened
a
little
but
i
might
have
known
she
is
hard
as
nails
of
course
it
was
my
fault
in
the
first
place
to
leave
her
as
i
did
but
when
i
acknowledged
it
and
when
i
wrote
that
letter
on
christmas
eve
i
thought
angelina
might
feel
differently
he
looked
at
his
watch
nearly
nine
he
muttered
i
may
as
well
go
home
she
said
she
wanted
to
be
let
alone
that
christmas
meant
nothing
to
her
i
do
dare
to
call
on
my
only
sister
i
suppose
she
is
there
all
alone
and
here
i
am
all
alone
too
what
a
pity
if
i
saw
the
least
sign
just
then
there
was
the
spark
of
a
match
against
the
darkness
framed
in
by
the
window
opposite
a
hand
and
arm
shone
in
the
flicker
of
light
across
the
upper
sash
a
tiny
spark
tremulous
at
first
like
a
bird
alighting
on
a
frail
branch
paused
steadied
and
became
fixed
in
the
light
of
a
small
taper
the
man
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
pale
long
face
in
a
frame
of
silver
hair
it
faded
into
the
background
but
above
the
candle
he
now
saw
with
arms
outstretched
as
it
seemed
toward
himself
a
pink
little
angel
with
gauzy
wings
the
man
heart
gave
a
leap
sudden
memories
thronged
his
brain
making
him
almost
dizzy
at
last
they
formulated
into
one
smothered
cry
the
christmas
angel
it
is
the
very
same
pink
angel
that
angelina
and
i
used
to
hang
on
our
christmas
tree
in
three
great
leaps
like
a
schoolboy
he
crossed
the
street
and
ran
up
the
steps
of
number
the
christmas
angel
seemed
to
smile
with
ineffable
sweetness
as
he
gave
the
bell
a
vigorous
pull

tom
miss
terry
was
leaning
on
the
looking
into
the
fire
when
the
bell
pealed
furiously
she
started
and
turned
pale
lord
mercy
ejaculated
norah
who
was
still
admiring
the
effect
of
the
what
that
who
can
be
calling
here
making
such
a
noise
go
to
the
door
norah
said
miss
terry
with
a
strange
note
in
her
voice
it
may
be
some
one
to
see
me
it
is
not
too
late
yes
said
norah
obedient
but
bewildered
presently
the
library
door
opened
and
a
figure
strode
in
a
tall
man
in
a
fur
overcoat
for
a
moment
he
stood
just
inside
the
door
hesitating
miss
terry
took
two
steps
forward
from
the
tom
she
said
faintly
you
came
after
all
after
all
angelina
he
said
yes
because
i
saw
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
window
that
gave
me
courage
to
come
in
it
is
our
christmas
angel
i
remember
all
about
it
does
it
mean
anything
angelina
miss
terry
held
out
a
moment
longer
then
she
faltered
forward
o
tom
she
sobbed
as
she
felt
his
brotherly
strong
arms
about
her
o
tom
and
so
he
has
brought
you
back
to
me
and
me
to
you
he
angelina
girl
who
he
smoothed
her
silver
hair
with
rough
kind
fingers
why
the
christmas
angel
our
guardian
angel
tom
all
these
years
i
kept
him
in
the
play
box
and
i
was
going
to
burn
him
up
but
i
could
do
it
tom
how
wonderful
it
is
they
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
she
began
to
tell
him
the
whole
story
but
she
interrupted
herself
to
send
for
norah
who
came
to
her
mystified
and
half
scandalized
by
the
greeting
which
she
had
seen
those
two
oldsters
exchange
this
is
my
brother
tom
norah
who
has
come
back
she
said
i
believe
it
is
not
too
late
to
make
some
preparation
for
christmas
day
the
stores
will
still
be
open
run
out
and
order
things
for
a
grand
occasion
norah
and
o
norah
a
sudden
remembrance
came
to
her
if
you
have
time
will
you
please
get
some
toys
and
pretty
things
such
as
a
little
girl
would
like
a
little
girl
of
about
ten
with
my
complexion
i
mean
with
yellow
hair
and
blue
eyes
we
may
have
a
little
guest
yes
said
norah
moving
like
one
in
a
dream
a
guest
exclaimed
tom
and
miss
terry
told
him
about
mary
i
love
little
girls
said
tom
especially
little
girls
with
yellow
hair
and
blue
eyes
such
as
you
used
to
have
angelina
you
will
like
mary
then
said
miss
terry
with
a
pretty
pink
flush
of
pleasure
in
her
cheeks
i
shall
like
her
she
comes
amended
tom
who
received
with
reservations
the
account
of
a
vision
vouchsafed
not
unto
him
she
will
come
said
miss
terry
with
her
old
positiveness
glancing
towards
the
window
where
the
christmas
angel
hung
then
arose
the
sound
of
singing
outside
the
house
the
passing
choristers
had
spied
the
quaint
window
now
the
only
one
in
the
street
which
remained
lighted
when
christ
was
born
of
mary
free
in
bethlehem
in
that
fair
citye
angels
sang
with
mirth
and
glee
excelsis
gloria
chapter
xv
christmas
day
and
mary
came
the
brother
and
sister
were
at
breakfast
the
happiest
which
either
of
them
had
known
for
years
when
there
came
a
timid
pull
at
the
bell
miss
angelina
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
and
looked
across
the
table
at
tom
she
has
come
mary
has
come
she
said
norah
if
it
is
a
little
girl
with
a
package
under
her
arm
bring
her
in
here
yes
gasped
norah
who
believed
she
was
living
in
a
dream
where
everything
was
when
had
a
child
entered
miss
norah
disappeared
and
presently
returned
ushering
in
a
little
girl
of
ten
with
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
under
her
arm
she
carried
a
package
very
badly
wrapped
miss
terry
exchanged
with
her
brother
a
glance
which
said
i
told
you
so
the
child
seemed
bashful
and
afraid
to
speak
no
wonder
tom
kind
heart
yearned
to
her
good
morning
wish
you
a
merry
christmas
mary
he
said
smiling
the
child
gave
a
start
why
how
did
you
know
my
name
she
cried
tom
looked
confused
how
indeed
did
he
know
but
miss
angelina
with
a
readiness
that
surprised
herself
came
to
his
rescue
we
were
talking
of
a
little
girl
named
mary
she
said
and
you
look
just
like
her
what
did
you
come
for
dear
the
little
girl
hung
her
head
and
turned
crimson
i
i
came
to
see
angelina
terry
she
whispered
i
i
got
a
doll
that
belongs
to
her
there
was
a
pause
then
miss
terry
said
well
go
on
i
i
found
her
on
the
steps
of
this
house
last
night
and
i
ought
to
have
brought
her
right
here
then
but
i
did
i
took
her
home
i
hope
angelina
was
not
very
unhappy
last
night
miss
terry
smiled
upon
tom
who
gave
a
kind
low
laugh
no
said
miss
terry
angelina
did
not
worry
about
her
lost
doll
she
was
thinking
about
something
else
the
nicest
christmas
present
that
ever
anybody
had
but
you
were
a
good
girl
to
bring
back
the
doll
no
i
not
a
good
girl
said
mary
and
her
voice
trembled
i
was
a
wicked
girl
i
meant
to
keep
miranda
for
myself
because
i
thought
she
would
be
a
lovely
big
doll
and
when
i
found
she
was
old
and
homely
somehow
i
still
wanted
to
keep
her
but
it
was
stealing
and
i
could
please
will
you
give
her
to
angelina
and
tell
her
i
am
so
sorry
she
took
miranda
out
of
the
wrapping
and
held
her
toward
miss
terry
without
looking
at
the
doll
it
was
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
being
tempted
once
more
illustration
mary
returns
the
doll
miss
terry
did
not
take
the
doll
i
am
angelina
she
said
the
doll
was
mine
you
angelina
the
child
face
was
full
of
bewilderment
mechanically
she
drew
miranda
to
her
and
clasped
her
close
yes
i
am
angelina
and
that
was
my
doll
miranda
said
miss
terry
gently
thank
you
for
returning
her
but
mary
your
name
is
mary
the
child
suppose
i
wanted
you
to
keep
her
for
me
what
would
you
say
mary
eyes
still
dwelt
upon
miss
terry
with
a
puzzled
look
this
angelina
was
so
different
from
the
one
she
had
pictured
she
did
not
answer
the
question
miss
terry
drew
the
child
to
a
chair
beside
her
tell
me
all
about
yourself
mary
she
said
after
some
coaxing
and
prompting
from
what
they
already
guessed
mary
told
the
story
of
her
sad
little
life
she
was
an
orphan
recently
left
to
the
care
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
who
had
received
her
grudgingly
they
were
her
sole
relatives
and
the
shame
of
their
degraded
lives
was
plain
through
the
outlines
of
the
vague
picture
which
mary
sketched
of
them
you
do
not
love
them
mary
asked
miss
terry
kindly
no
answered
the
child
they
always
speak
crossly
to
me
when
they
have
been
drinking
they
beat
me
tom
rose
from
the
table
with
a
muttered
word
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
his
blue
eyes
were
full
of
tears
mary
said
miss
terry
will
the
people
at
home
be
worried
if
you
do
not
come
back
to
dinner
mary
shook
her
head
wonderingly
no
she
said
they
will
not
care
i
am
often
away
on
holidays
i
go
to
the
museums
then
i
want
you
to
stay
with
us
said
miss
terry
we
are
going
to
have
a
christmas
celebration
and
we
need
you
for
a
guest
will
you
stay
you
and
miranda
mary
looked
down
at
the
doll
in
her
arms
and
up
at
the
two
kind
faces
bent
toward
her
yes
she
said
impulsively
i
will
stay
how
good
you
are
i
do
want
to
go
home
do
go
home
burst
out
tom
stay
with
us
always
and
be
our
little
girl
mary
looked
from
one
to
the
other
half
frightened
at
the
new
idea
miss
terry
bent
and
pecked
at
her
cheek
with
a
thrill
at
the
new
sensation
yes
we
mean
it
she
said
and
her
voice
was
almost
sweet
we
believe
that
the
christmas
angel
has
brought
you
to
us
mary
you
have
the
christmas
name
but
you
seem
to
us
like
the
little
girl
we
both
knew
best
little
angelina
with
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
who
was
miranda
mother
will
you
stay
with
us
mary
angelina
would
you
like
to
stay
mary
looked
up
with
a
wistful
smile
you
are
so
good
she
said
again
i
wish
i
could
stay
but
uncle
and
aunt
are
so
i
am
afraid
of
what
they
might
do
to
us
all
if
they
thought
you
wanted
me
they
would
not
let
me
go
i
will
fix
uncle
and
aunt
said
tom
going
for
his
coat
leave
them
to
me
i
know
an
argument
that
settles
uncles
and
aunts
of
that
sort
you
need
not
go
back
to
their
house
i
promise
you
mary
my
dear
mary
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
oh
i
am
so
glad
she
said
it
was
such
a
wicked
house
and
here
it
is
so
good
good
miss
terry
echoed
the
word
with
a
sigh
come
with
me
mary
she
said
she
led
her
little
guest
through
the
hall
to
the
library
where
a
great
fire
was
blazing
with
sundry
mysterious
packages
in
white
paper
piled
on
the
table
beside
it
but
miss
terry
did
not
stop
at
the
she
drew
mary
to
the
window
which
looked
out
on
the
sidewalk
above
the
lower
sash
mary
saw
the
remains
of
a
christmas
candle
and
over
it
hung
a
pink
angel
stretching
out
open
arms
towards
her
this
is
the
christmas
angel
mary
said
miss
terry
he
is
as
old
as
miranda
he
is
as
old
as
christmas
interrupted
tom
looking
in
from
the
hall
when
we
were
children
tom
and
i
we
hung
him
on
our
christmas
tree
went
on
miss
terry
we
think
he
brought
you
to
us
we
believe
he
has
changed
the
world
for
us

brought
us
peace
and
happiness
he
is
going
to
be
the
guardian
angel
of
our
house
you
must
love
him
mary
how
beautiful
he
is
said
mary
reverently
his
face
shines
like
the
baby
that
i
saw
once
in
the
church
oh
miss
angelina
he
is
like
the
himself
call
me
aunt
angelina
said
miss
terry
with
a
quick
breath
aunt
angelina
cried
the
child
throwing
her
arms
about
miss
neck
tom
came
and
put
his
great
furry
about
them
both
and
uncle
tom
he
said
dear
uncle
tom
whispered
the
child
shyly
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
all
three
now
we
shall
live
happy
ever
after
said
tom
and
the
christmas
angel
beamed
upon
them
