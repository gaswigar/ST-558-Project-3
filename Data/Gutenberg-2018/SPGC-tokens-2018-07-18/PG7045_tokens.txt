uncle
charlie
wheeler
stamped
on
the
steps
before
nance
on
the
main
street
of
the
town
of
coal
creek
pennsylvania
and
then
went
quickly
inside
something
pleased
him
and
as
he
stood
before
the
counter
in
the
shop
he
laughed
and
whistled
softly
with
a
wink
at
the
reverend
minot
weeks
who
stood
by
the
door
leading
to
the
street
he
tapped
with
his
knuckles
on
the
showcase
it
has
he
said
waving
attention
to
the
boy
who
was
making
a
mess
of
the
effort
to
arrange
uncle
charlie
loaf
into
a
neat
package
a
pretty
name
they
call
it
norman
norman
uncle
charlie
laughed
heartily
and
again
stamped
upon
the
floor
putting
his
finger
to
his
forehead
to
suggest
deep
thought
he
turned
to
the
minister
i
am
going
to
change
all
that
he
said
norman
indeed
i
shall
give
him
a
name
that
will
stick
norman
too
soft
too
soft
and
delicate
for
coal
creek
eh
it
shall
be
rechristened
you
and
i
will
be
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
naming
things
we
will
call
it
beaut
our
beautiful
one
beaut
the
reverend
minot
weeks
also
laughed
he
thrust
four
ringers
of
each
hand
into
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
letting
the
extended
thumbs
lie
along
the
swelling
waist
line
from
the
front
the
thumbs
looked
like
two
tiny
boats
on
the
horizon
of
a
troubled
sea
they
bobbed
and
jumped
about
on
the
rolling
shaking
paunch
appearing
and
disappearing
as
laughter
shook
him
the
reverend
minot
weeks
went
out
at
the
door
ahead
of
uncle
charlie
still
laughing
one
fancied
that
he
would
go
along
the
street
from
store
to
store
telling
the
tale
of
the
christening
and
laughing
again
the
tall
boy
could
imagine
the
details
of
the
story
it
was
an
ill
day
for
births
in
coal
creek
even
for
the
birth
of
one
of
uncle
charlie
inspirations
snow
lay
piled
along
the
sidewalks
and
in
the
gutters
of
main
street
black
snow
sordid
with
the
gathered
grime
of
human
endeavour
that
went
on
day
and
night
in
the
bowels
of
the
hills
through
the
soiled
snow
walked
miners
stumbling
along
silently
and
with
blackened
faces
in
their
bare
hands
they
carried
dinner
pails
the
mcgregor
boy
tall
and
awkward
and
with
a
towering
nose
great
mouth
and
fiery
red
hair
followed
uncle
charlie
republican
politician
postmaster
and
village
wit
to
the
door
and
looked
after
him
as
with
the
loaf
of
bread
under
his
arm
he
hurried
along
the
street
behind
the
politician
went
the
minister
still
enjoying
the
scene
in
the
bakery
he
was
preening
himself
on
his
nearness
to
life
in
the
mining
town
did
not
christ
himself
laugh
eat
and
drink
with
publicans
and
sinners
he
thought
as
he
waddled
through
the
snow
the
eyes
of
the
mcgregor
boy
as
they
followed
the
two
departing
figures
and
later
as
he
stood
in
the
door
of
the
watching
the
struggling
miners
glistened
with
hatred
it
was
the
quality
of
intense
hatred
for
his
fellows
in
the
black
hole
between
the
pennsylvania
hills
that
marked
the
boy
and
made
him
stand
forth
among
his
fellows
in
a
country
of
so
many
varied
climates
and
occupations
as
america
it
is
absurd
to
talk
of
an
american
type
the
country
is
like
a
vast
disorganised
undisciplined
army
leaderless
uninspired
going
in
along
the
road
to
they
know
not
what
end
in
the
prairie
towns
of
the
west
and
the
river
towns
of
the
south
from
which
have
come
so
many
of
our
writing
men
the
citizens
swagger
through
life
drunken
old
reprobates
lie
in
the
shade
by
the
river
edge
or
wander
through
the
streets
of
a
corn
shipping
village
of
a
saturday
evening
with
grins
on
their
faces
some
touch
of
nature
a
sweet
undercurrent
of
life
stays
alive
in
them
and
is
handed
down
to
those
who
write
of
them
and
the
most
worthless
man
that
walks
the
streets
of
an
ohio
or
iowa
town
may
be
the
father
of
an
epigram
that
colours
all
the
life
of
the
men
about
him
in
a
mining
town
or
deep
in
the
entrails
of
one
of
our
cities
life
is
different
there
the
disorder
and
aimlessness
of
our
american
lives
becomes
a
crime
for
which
men
pay
heavily
losing
step
with
one
another
men
lose
also
a
sense
of
their
own
individuality
so
that
a
thousand
of
them
may
be
driven
in
a
disorderly
mass
in
at
the
door
of
a
chicago
factory
morning
after
morning
and
year
after
year
with
never
an
epigram
from
the
lips
of
one
of
them
in
coal
creek
when
men
got
drunk
they
staggered
in
silence
through
the
street
did
one
of
them
in
a
moment
of
stupid
animal
sportiveness
execute
a
clumsy
dance
upon
the
barroom
floor
his
fellow
labourers
looked
at
him
dumbly
or
turning
away
left
him
to
finish
without
witnesses
his
clumsy
hilarity
standing
in
the
doorway
and
looking
up
and
down
the
bleak
village
street
some
dim
realisation
of
the
disorganised
ineffectiveness
of
life
as
he
knew
it
came
into
the
mind
of
the
mcgregor
boy
it
seemed
to
him
right
and
natural
that
he
should
hate
men
with
a
sneer
on
his
lips
he
thought
of
barney
butterlips
the
town
socialist
who
was
forever
talking
of
a
day
coming
when
men
would
march
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
life
in
coal
creek
life
everywhere
should
cease
being
aimless
and
become
definite
and
full
of
meaning
they
will
never
do
that
and
who
wants
them
to
mused
the
mcgregor
boy
a
blast
of
wind
bearing
snow
beat
upon
him
and
he
turned
into
the
shop
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
another
thought
stirred
in
his
head
and
brought
a
flush
to
his
cheeks
he
turned
and
stood
in
the
silence
of
the
empty
shop
shaking
with
emotion
if
i
could
form
the
men
of
this
place
into
an
army
i
would
lead
them
to
the
mouth
of
the
old
shumway
cut
and
push
them
in
he
threatened
shaking
his
fist
toward
the
door
i
would
stand
aside
and
see
the
whole
town
struggle
and
drown
in
the
black
water
as
untouched
as
though
i
watched
the
drowning
of
a
litter
of
dirty
little
the
next
morning
when
beaut
mcgregor
pushed
his
baker
cart
along
the
street
and
began
climbing
the
hill
toward
the
miners
cottages
he
went
not
as
norman
mcgregor
the
town
baker
boy
only
product
of
the
loins
of
cracked
mcgregor
of
coal
creek
but
as
a
personage
a
being
the
object
of
an
art
the
name
given
him
by
uncle
charlie
wheeler
had
made
him
a
marked
man
he
was
as
the
hero
of
a
popular
romance
galvanised
into
life
and
striding
in
the
flesh
before
the
people
men
looked
at
him
with
new
interest
inventorying
anew
the
huge
mouth
and
nose
and
the
flaming
hair
the
bartender
sweeping
the
snow
from
before
the
door
of
the
saloon
shouted
at
him
hey
norman
he
called
sweet
norman
norman
is
too
pretty
a
name
beaut
is
the
name
for
you
oh
you
beaut
the
tall
boy
pushed
the
cart
silently
along
the
street
again
he
hated
coal
creek
he
hated
the
bakery
and
the
bakery
cart
with
a
burning
satisfying
hate
he
hated
uncle
charlie
wheeler
and
the
reverend
minot
weeks
fat
old
fools
he
muttered
as
he
shook
the
snow
off
his
hat
and
paused
to
breathe
in
the
struggle
up
the
hill
he
had
something
new
to
hate
he
hated
his
own
name
it
did
sound
ridiculous
he
had
thought
before
that
there
was
something
fancy
and
pretentious
about
it
it
did
not
fit
a
bakery
cart
boy
he
wished
it
might
have
been
plain
john
or
jim
or
fred
a
quiver
of
irritation
at
his
mother
passed
through
him
she
might
have
used
more
sense
he
muttered
and
then
the
thought
came
to
him
that
his
father
might
have
chosen
the
name
that
checked
his
flight
toward
universal
hatred
and
he
began
pushing
the
cart
forward
again
a
more
genial
current
of
thought
running
through
his
mind
the
tall
boy
loved
the
memory
of
his
father
cracked
they
called
him
until
that
became
his
name
he
thought
now
they
are
at
the
thought
renewed
a
feeling
of
fellowship
between
himself
and
his
dead
father
it
softened
him
when
he
reached
the
first
of
the
bleak
miners
houses
a
smile
played
about
the
corners
of
his
huge
mouth
in
his
day
cracked
mcgregor
had
not
borne
a
good
reputation
in
coal
creek
he
was
a
tall
silent
man
with
something
morose
and
dangerous
about
him
he
inspired
fear
born
of
hatred
in
the
mines
he
worked
silently
and
with
fiery
energy
hating
his
fellow
miners
among
whom
he
was
thought
to
be
a
bit
off
his
they
it
was
who
named
him
cracked
mcgregor
and
they
avoided
him
while
subscribing
to
the
common
opinion
that
he
was
the
best
miner
in
the
district
like
his
fellow
workers
he
occasionally
got
drunk
when
he
went
into
the
saloon
where
other
men
stood
in
groups
buying
drinks
for
each
other
he
bought
only
for
himself
once
a
stranger
a
fat
man
who
sold
liquor
for
a
wholesale
house
approached
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
come
cheer
up
and
have
a
drink
with
me
he
said
cracked
mcgregor
turned
and
knocked
the
stranger
to
the
floor
when
the
fat
man
was
down
he
kicked
him
and
glared
at
the
crowd
in
the
room
then
he
walked
slowly
out
at
the
door
staring
around
and
hoping
some
one
would
interfere
in
his
house
also
cracked
mcgregor
was
silent
when
he
spoke
at
all
he
spoke
kindly
and
looked
into
the
eyes
of
his
wife
with
an
eager
expectant
air
to
his
son
he
seemed
to
be
forever
pouring
forth
a
kind
of
dumb
affection
taking
the
boy
in
his
arms
he
sat
for
hours
rocking
back
and
forth
and
saying
nothing
when
the
boy
was
ill
or
troubled
by
strange
dreams
at
night
the
feel
of
his
father
arms
about
him
quieted
him
in
his
arms
the
boy
went
to
sleep
happily
in
the
mind
of
the
father
there
was
a
single
recurring
thought
we
have
but
the
one
bairn
we
not
put
him
into
the
hole
in
the
ground
he
said
looking
eagerly
to
the
mother
for
approval
twice
had
cracked
mcgregor
walked
with
his
son
on
a
sunday
afternoon
taking
the
lad
by
the
hand
the
miner
went
up
the
face
of
the
hill
past
the
last
of
the
miners
houses
through
the
grove
of
pine
trees
at
the
summit
and
on
over
the
hill
into
sight
of
a
wide
valley
on
the
farther
side
when
he
walked
he
twisted
his
head
far
to
one
side
like
one
listening
a
falling
timber
in
the
mines
had
given
him
a
deformed
shoulder
and
left
a
great
scar
on
his
face
partly
covered
by
a
red
beard
filled
with
coal
dust
the
blow
that
had
deformed
his
shoulder
had
clouded
his
mind
he
muttered
as
he
walked
along
the
road
and
talked
to
himself
like
an
old
man
the
boy
ran
beside
his
father
happily
he
did
not
see
the
smiles
on
the
faces
of
the
miners
who
came
down
the
hill
and
stopped
to
look
at
the
odd
pair
the
miners
went
on
down
the
road
to
sit
in
front
of
the
stores
on
main
street
their
day
brightened
by
the
memory
of
the
hurrying
mcgregors
they
had
a
remark
they
tossed
about
nance
mcgregor
should
not
have
looked
at
her
man
when
she
conceived
they
said
up
the
face
of
the
hill
climbed
the
mcgregors
in
the
mind
of
the
boy
a
thousand
questions
wanted
answering
looking
at
the
silent
gloomy
face
of
his
father
he
choked
back
the
questions
rising
in
his
throat
saving
them
for
the
quiet
hour
with
his
mother
when
cracked
mcgregor
was
gone
to
the
mine
he
wanted
to
know
of
the
boyhood
of
his
father
of
the
life
in
the
mine
of
the
birds
that
flew
overhead
and
why
they
wheeled
and
flew
in
great
ovals
in
the
sky
he
looked
at
the
fallen
trees
in
the
woods
and
wondered
what
made
them
fall
and
whether
the
others
would
presently
fall
in
their
turn
over
the
hill
went
the
silent
pair
and
through
the
pinewood
to
an
eminence
half
way
down
the
farther
side
when
the
boy
saw
the
valley
lying
so
green
and
broad
and
fruitful
at
their
feet
he
thought
it
the
most
wonderful
sight
in
the
world
he
was
not
surprised
that
his
father
had
brought
him
there
sitting
on
the
ground
he
opened
and
closed
his
eyes
his
soul
stirred
by
the
beauty
of
the
scene
that
lay
before
them
on
the
hillside
cracked
mcgregor
went
through
a
kind
of
ceremony
sitting
upon
a
log
he
made
a
telescope
of
his
hands
and
looked
over
the
valley
inch
by
inch
like
one
seeking
something
lost
for
ten
minutes
he
would
look
intently
at
a
clump
of
trees
or
a
spot
in
the
river
running
through
the
valley
where
it
broadened
and
where
the
water
roughened
by
the
wind
glistened
in
the
sun
a
smile
lurked
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
he
muttered
incoherent
words
and
bits
of
sentences
once
he
broke
forth
into
a
low
droning
song
on
the
first
morning
when
the
boy
sat
on
the
hillside
with
his
father
it
was
spring
and
the
land
was
vividly
green
lambs
played
in
the
fields
birds
sang
their
mating
songs
in
the
air
on
the
earth
and
in
the
water
of
the
flowing
river
it
was
a
time
of
new
life
below
the
flat
valley
of
green
fields
was
patched
and
spotted
with
brown
earth
the
cattle
walking
with
bowed
heads
eating
the
sweet
grass
the
farmhouses
with
red
barns
the
pungent
smell
of
the
new
ground
fired
his
mind
and
awoke
the
sleeping
sense
of
beauty
in
the
boy
he
sat
upon
the
log
drunk
with
happiness
that
the
world
in
which
he
lived
could
be
so
beautiful
in
his
bed
at
night
he
dreamed
of
the
valley
confounding
it
with
the
old
bible
tale
of
the
garden
of
eden
told
him
by
his
mother
he
dreamed
that
he
and
his
mother
went
over
the
hill
and
down
toward
the
valley
but
that
his
father
wearing
a
long
white
robe
and
with
his
red
hair
blowing
in
the
wind
stood
upon
the
hillside
swinging
a
long
sword
blazing
with
fire
and
drove
them
back
when
the
boy
went
again
over
the
hill
it
was
october
and
a
cold
wind
blew
down
the
hill
into
his
face
in
the
woods
golden
brown
leaves
ran
about
like
frightened
little
animals
and
were
the
leaves
on
the
trees
about
the
farmhouses
and
the
corn
standing
shocked
in
the
fields
the
scene
saddened
the
boy
a
lump
came
into
his
throat
and
he
wanted
back
the
green
shining
beauty
of
the
spring
he
wished
to
hear
the
birds
singing
in
the
air
and
in
the
grass
on
the
hillside
cracked
mcgregor
was
in
another
mood
he
seemed
more
satisfied
than
on
the
first
visit
and
ran
up
and
down
on
the
little
eminence
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
on
the
legs
of
his
trousers
through
the
long
afternoon
he
sat
on
the
log
muttering
and
smiling
on
the
road
home
through
the
darkened
woods
the
restless
hurrying
leaves
frightened
the
boy
so
that
with
his
weariness
from
walking
against
the
wind
his
hunger
from
being
all
day
without
food
and
with
the
cold
nipping
at
his
body
he
began
to
cry
the
father
took
the
boy
in
his
arms
and
holding
him
across
his
breast
like
a
babe
went
down
the
hill
to
their
home
it
was
on
a
tuesday
morning
that
cracked
mcgregor
died
his
death
fixed
itself
as
something
fine
in
the
mind
of
the
boy
and
the
scene
and
the
circumstance
stayed
with
him
through
life
filling
him
with
secret
pride
like
a

was
past
ten
in
the
morning
when
the
cry
of
fire
in
the
mine
ran
up
the
hill
to
the
houses
of
the
miners
a
panic
seized
the
women
in
their
minds
they
saw
the
men
hurrying
down
old
cuts
crouching
in
hidden
corridors
pursued
by
death

one
of
the

in
his
house
the
boy
mother
threw
a
shawl
about
her
head
took
his
hand
and
ran
down
the
hill
to
the
mouth
of
the
mine
cold
winds
spitting
snow
blew
in
their
faces
they
ran
along
the
tracks
of
the
railroad
stumbling
over
the
ties
and
stood
on
the
railroad
embankment
that
overlooked
the
runway
to
the
mine
about
the
runway
and
along
the
embankment
stood
the
silent
miners
their
hands
in
their
trousers
pockets
staring
stolidly
at
the
closed
door
of
the
mine
among
them
was
no
impulse
toward
concerted
action
like
animals
at
the
door
of
a
they
stood
as
though
waiting
their
turn
to
be
driven
in
at
the
door
an
old
crone
with
bent
back
and
a
huge
stick
in
her
hand
went
from
one
to
another
of
the
miners
gesticulating
and
talking

out
of
there
she
shouted
waving
the
stick
about
the
door
of

and
three
men
came
out
staggering
as
they
pushed
before
them
a
small
car
that
ran
upon
rails
on
the
car
lay
three
other
men
silent
and
motionless
a
woman
thinly
clad
and
with
great
hollows
in
her
face
climbed
the
embankment
and
sat
upon
the
ground
below
the
boy
and
his
mother
the
fire

in
the
old
mccrary

said
her
voice

through
to
close
the
doors
my
man

put
down
her
head
and
sat
weeping
the
boy
knew
the
woman
she
was
a
neighbour
who
lived
in
an
unpainted
house
on
the
hillside
in
the
yard
in
front
of
her
house
a
swarm
of
children
played
among
the
stones
her
husband
a
great
hulking
fellow
got
drunk
and
when
he
came
home
kicked
his
wife
the
boy
had
heard
her
screaming
at
night
suddenly
in
the
growing
crowd
of
miners
below
the
embankment
beaut
mcgregor
saw
his
father
moving
restlessly
about
on
his
head
he
had
his
cap
with
the
miner
lamp
lighted
he
went
from
group
to
group
among
the
people
his
head
hanging
to
one
side
the
boy
looked
at
him
intently
he
was
reminded
of
the
october
day
on
the
eminence
overlooking
the
fruitful
valley
and
again
he
thought
of
his
father
as
a
man
inspired
going
through
a
kind
of
ceremony
the
tall
miner
rubbed
his
hands
up
and
down
his
legs
he
peered
into
the
faces
of
the
silent
men
standing
about
his
lips
moved
and
his
red
beard
danced
up
and
down
as
the
boy
looked
a
change
came
over
the
face
of
cracked
mcgregor
he
ran
to
the
foot
of
the
embankment
and
looked
up
in
his
eyes
was
the
look
of
a
perplexed
animal
the
wife
bent
down
and
began
to
talk
to
the
weeping
woman
on
the
ground
trying
to
comfort
her
she
did
not
see
her
husband
and
the
boy
and
man
stood
in
silence
looking
into
each
eyes
then
the
puzzled
look
went
out
of
the
father
face
he
turned
and
running
along
with
his
head
rolling
about
reached
the
closed
door
of
the
mine
a
man
who
wore
a
white
collar
and
had
a
cigar
stuck
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
put
out
his
hand
stop
wait
he
shouted
pushing
the
man
aside
with
his
powerful
arm
the
runner
pulled
open
the
door
of
the
mine
and
disappeared
down
the
runway
a
hubbub
arose
the
man
in
the
white
collar
took
the
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
began
to
swear
violently
the
boy
stood
on
the
embankment
and
saw
his
mother
running
toward
the
runway
of
the
mine
a
miner
gripped
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
back
up
the
face
of
the
embankment
in
the
crowd
a
woman
voice
shouted
it
cracked
mcgregor
gone
to
close
the
door
to
the
mccrary
the
man
with
the
white
collar
glared
about
as
he
chewed
the
end
of
his
cigar
he
gone
crazy
he
shouted
again
closing
the
door
to
the
mine
cracked
mcgregor
died
in
the
mine
almost
within
reach
of
the
door
to
the
old
cut
where
the
fire
burned
with
him
died
all
but
five
of
the
imprisoned
miners
all
day
parties
of
men
tried
to
get
down
into
the
mine
below
in
the
hidden
passages
under
their
own
homes
the
scurrying
miners
died
like
rats
in
a
burning
barn
while
their
wives
with
shawls
over
their
heads
sat
silently
weeping
on
the
railroad
embankment
in
the
evening
the
boy
and
his
mother
went
up
the
hill
alone
from
the
houses
scattered
over
the
hill
came
the
sound
of
women
weeping
for
several
years
after
the
mine
disaster
the
mcgregors
mother
and
son
lived
in
the
house
on
the
hillside
the
woman
went
each
morning
to
the
offices
of
the
mine
where
she
washed
windows
and
scrubbed
floors
the
position
was
a
sort
of
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
mine
officials
of
the
heroism
of
cracked
mcgregor
nance
mcgregor
was
a
small
woman
with
a
sharp
nose
she
wore
glasses
and
had
the
name
in
coal
creek
of
being
quick
and
sharp
she
did
not
stand
by
the
fence
to
talk
with
the
wives
of
other
miners
but
sat
in
her
house
and
sewed
or
read
aloud
to
her
son
she
subscribed
for
a
magazine
and
had
bound
copies
of
it
standing
upon
shelves
in
the
room
where
she
and
the
boy
ate
breakfast
in
the
early
morning
before
the
death
of
her
husband
she
had
maintained
a
habit
of
silence
in
her
house
but
after
his
death
she
expanded
and
with
her
son
discussed
freely
every
phase
of
their
narrow
lives
as
he
grew
older
the
boy
began
to
believe
that
she
like
the
miners
had
kept
hidden
under
her
silence
a
secret
fear
of
his
father
certain
things
she
said
of
her
life
encouraged
the
thought
norman
mcgregor
grew
into
a
tall
boy
with
strong
arms
flaming
red
hair
and
a
habit
of
sudden
and
violent
fits
of
temper
there
was
something
about
him
that
held
the
attention
as
he
grew
older
and
was
renamed
by
uncle
charlie
wheeler
he
began
going
about
looking
for
trouble
when
the
boys
called
him
beaut
he
knocked
them
down
when
men
shouted
the
name
after
him
on
the
street
he
followed
them
with
black
looks
it
became
a
point
of
honour
with
him
to
resent
the
name
he
connected
it
with
the
town
unfairness
to
cracked
mcgregor
in
the
house
on
the
hillside
the
boy
and
his
mother
lived
together
happily
in
the
early
morning
they
went
down
the
hill
and
across
the
tracks
to
the
offices
of
the
mine
from
the
offices
the
boy
went
up
the
hill
on
the
farther
side
of
the
valley
and
sat
upon
the
schoolhouse
steps
or
wandered
in
the
streets
waiting
for
the
day
in
school
to
begin
in
the
evening
mother
and
son
sat
upon
the
steps
at
the
front
of
their
home
and
watched
the
glare
of
the
coke
ovens
on
the
sky
and
the
lights
of
the
passenger
trains
roaring
whistling
and
disappearing
into
the
night
nance
mcgregor
talked
to
her
son
of
the
big
world
outside
the
valley
and
told
him
of
the
cities
the
seas
and
the
strange
lands
and
peoples
beyond
the
seas
we
have
dug
in
the
ground
like
rats
she
said
i
and
my
people
and
your
father
and
his
people
with
you
it
will
be
different
you
will
get
out
of
here
to
other
places
and
other
she
grew
indignant
thinking
of
the
life
in
the
town
we
are
stuck
down
here
amid
dirt
living
in
it
breathing
it
she
complained
sixty
men
died
in
that
hole
in
the
ground
and
then
the
mine
started
again
with
new
men
we
stay
here
year
after
year
digging
coal
to
burn
in
engines
that
take
other
people
across
the
seas
and
into
the
when
the
son
was
a
tall
strong
boy
of
fourteen
nance
mcgregor
bought
the
bakery
and
to
buy
it
took
the
money
saved
by
cracked
mcgregor
with
it
he
had
planned
to
buy
a
farm
in
the
valley
beyond
the
hill
dollar
by
dollar
it
had
been
put
away
by
the
miner
who
dreamed
of
life
in
his
own
fields
in
the
bakery
the
boy
worked
and
learned
to
make
bread
kneading
the
dough
his
arms
and
hands
grew
as
strong
as
a
bear
he
hated
the
work
he
hated
coal
creek
and
dreamed
of
life
in
the
city
and
of
the
part
he
should
play
there
among
the
young
men
he
began
to
make
here
and
there
a
friend
like
his
father
he
attracted
attention
women
looked
at
him
laughed
at
his
big
frame
and
strong
homely
features
and
looked
again
when
they
spoke
to
him
in
the
bakery
or
on
the
street
he
spoke
back
fearlessly
and
looked
them
in
the
eyes
young
girls
in
the
school
walked
home
down
the
hill
with
other
boys
and
at
night
dreamed
of

when
some
one
spoke
ill
of
him

answered

and
praising
him
like
his
father

was
a
marked
man

creek
chapter
ii
one
sunday
afternoon
three
boys
sat
on
a
log
on
the
side
of
the
hill
that
looked
down
into
coal
creek
from
where
they
sat
they
could
see
the
workers
of
the
night
shift
idling
in
the
sun
on
main
street
from
the
coke
ovens
a
thin
line
of
smoke
rose
into
the
sky
a
freight
train
heavily
loaded
crept
round
the
hill
at
the
end
of
the
valley
it
was
spring
and
over
even
that
hive
of
black
industry
hung
a
faint
promise
of
beauty
the
boys
talked
of
the
life
of
people
in
their
town
and
as
they
talked
thought
each
of
himself
although
he
had
not
been
out
of
the
valley
and
had
grown
strong
and
big
there
beaut
mcgregor
knew
something
of
the
outside
world
it
is
a
time
when
men
are
shut
off
from
their
fellows
newspapers
and
magazines
have
done
their
work
too
well
they
reached
even
into
the
miner
cabin
and
the
merchants
along
main
street
of
coal
creek
stood
before
their
stores
in
the
afternoon
and
talked
of
the
doings
of
the
world
beaut
mcgregor
knew
that
life
in
his
town
was
exceptional
that
not
everywhere
did
men
toil
all
day
black
and
grimy
underground
that
not
all
women
were
pale
bloodless
and
bent
as
he
went
about
delivering
bread
he
whistled
a
song
take
me
back
to
broadway
he
sang
after
the
soubrette
in
a
show
that
had
once
come
to
coal
creek
now
as
he
sat
on
the
hillside
he
talked
earnestly
while
he
gesticulated
with
his
hands
i
hate
this
town
he
said
the
men
here
think
they
are
confoundedly
funny
they
do
care
for
anything
but
making
foolish
jokes
and
getting
drunk
i
want
to
go
his
voice
rose
and
hatred
flamed
up
in
him
you
wait
he
boasted
i
make
men
stop
being
fools
i
make
children
of
them
i
pausing
he
looked
at
his
two
companions
beaut
poked
the
ground
with
a
stick
the
boy
sitting
beside
him
laughed
he
was
a
short
well
dressed
black
haired
boy
with
rings
on
his
fingers
who
worked
in
the
town
poolroom
racking
the
pool
balls
i
like
to
go
where
there
are
women
with
blood
in
them
he
said
three
women
came
up
the
hill
toward
them
a
tall
pale
woman
of
and
two
fairer
young
girls
the
boy
straightened
his
tie
and
began
thinking
of
a
conversation
he
would
start
when
the
women
reached
him
beaut
and
the
other
boy
a
fat
fellow
the
son
of
a
grocer
looked
down
the
hill
to
the
town
over
the
heads
of
the
newcomers
and
continued
in
their
minds
the
thoughts
that
had
made
the
conversation
hello
girls
come
and
sit
here
shouted
the
boy
laughing
and
looking
boldly
into
the
eyes
of
the
tall
pale
woman
they
stopped
and
the
tall
woman
began
stepping
over
the
fallen
logs
coming
to
them
the
two
young
girls
followed
laughing
they
sat
down
on
the
log
beside
the
boys
the
tall
pale
woman
at
the
end
beside
mcgregor
an
embarrassed
silence
fell
over
the
party
both
beaut
and
the
fat
boy
were
disconcerted
by
this
turn
to
their
afternoon
outing
and
wondered
how
it
would
turn
out
the
pale
woman
began
to
talk
in
a
low
tone
i
want
to
get
away
from
here
she
said
i
wish
i
could
hear
birds
sing
and
see
green
things
beaut
mcgregor
had
an
idea
you
come
with
me
he
said
he
got
up
and
climbed
over
the
logs
and
the
pale
woman
followed
the
fat
boy
shouted
at
them
relieving
his
own
embarrassment
by
trying
to
embarrass
them
where
you
going
you
two
he
shouted
beaut
said
nothing
he
stepped
over
the
logs
to
the
road
and
began
climbing
the
hill
the
tall
woman
walked
beside
him
and
held
her
skirts
out
of
the
deep
dust
of
the
road
even
on
this
her
sunday
gown
there
was
a
faint
black
mark
along
the
seams
the
mark
of
coal
creek
as
mcgregor
walked
his
embarrassment
left
him
he
thought
it
fine
that
he
should
be
thus
alone
with
a
woman
when
she
had
tired
from
the
climb
he
sat
with
her
on
a
log
beside
the
road
and
talked
of
the
boy
he
has
your
ring
on
his
finger
he
said
looking
at
her
and
laughing
she
held
her
hand
pressed
tightly
against
her
side
and
closed
her
eyes
the
climbing
hurts
me
she
said
tenderness
took
hold
of
beaut
when
they
went
on
again
he
walked
behind
her
his
hand
upon
her
back
pushing
her
up
the
hill
the
desire
to
tease
her
about
the
boy
had
passed
and
he
wished
he
had
said
nothing
about
the
ring
he
remembered
the
story
the
boy
had
told
him
of
his
conquest
of
the
woman
more
than
likely
a
mess
of
lies
he
thought
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
they
stopped
and
rested
leaning
against
a
worn
rail
fence
by
the
woods
below
them
in
a
wagon
a
party
of
men
went
down
the
hill
the
men
sat
upon
boards
laid
across
the
box
of
a
wagon
and
sang
a
song
one
of
them
stood
in
the
seat
beside
the
driver
and
waved
a
bottle
he
seemed
to
be
making
a
speech
the
others
shouted
and
clapped
their
hands
the
sounds
came
faint
and
sharp
up
the
hill
in
the
woods
beside
the
fence
rank
grass
grew
hawks
floated
in
the
sky
over
the
valley
below
a
squirrel
running
along
the
fence
stopped
and
chattered
at
them
mcgregor
thought
he
had
never
had
so
delightful
a
companion
he
got
a
feeling
of
complete
good
fellowship
and
friendliness
with
this
woman
without
knowing
how
the
thing
had
been
done
he
felt
a
certain
pride
in
it
do
mind
what
i
said
about
the
ring
he
urged
i
was
only
trying
to
tease
the
woman
beside
mcgregor
was
the
daughter
of
an
undertaker
who
lived
upstairs
over
his
shop
near
the
bakery
he
had
seen
her
in
the
evening
standing
in
the
stairway
by
the
shop
door
after
the
story
told
him
by
the
boy
he
had
been
embarrassed
about
her
when
he
passed
her
standing
in
the
stairway
he
went
hurriedly
along
and
looked
into
the
gutter
they
went
down
the
hill
and
sat
on
the
log
upon
the
hillside
a
clump
of
elders
had
grown
about
the
log
since
his
visits
there
with
cracked
mcgregor
so
that
the
place
was
closed
and
shaded
like
a
room
the
woman
took
off
her
hat
and
laid
it
beside
her
on
the
log
a
faint
colour
mounted
to
her
pale
cheeks
and
a
flash
of
anger
gleamed
in
her
eyes
he
probably
lied
to
you
about
me
she
said
i
did
give
him
that
ring
to
wear
i
do
know
why
i
gave
it
to
him
he
wanted
it
he
asked
me
for
it
time
and
again
he
said
he
wanted
to
show
it
to
his
mother
and
now
he
has
shown
it
to
you
and
i
suppose
told
lies
about
beaut
was
annoyed
and
wished
he
had
not
mentioned
the
ring
he
felt
that
an
unnecessary
fuss
was
being
made
about
it
he
did
not
believe
that
the
boy
had
lied
but
he
did
not
think
it
mattered
he
began
talking
of
his
father
boasting
of
him
his
hatred
of
the
town
blazed
up
they
thought
they
knew
him
down
there
he
said
they
laughed
at
him
and
called
him
they
thought
his
running
into
the
mine
just
a
crazy
notion
like
a
horse
that
runs
into
a
burning
stable
he
was
the
best
man
in
town
he
was
braver
than
any
of
them
he
went
in
there
and
died
when
he
had
almost
enough
money
saved
to
buy
a
farm
over
he
pointed
down
the
valley
beaut
began
to
tell
her
of
the
visits
to
the
hillside
with
his
father
and
described
the
effect
of
the
scene
on
himself
when
he
was
a
child
i
thought
it
was
paradise
he
said
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
seemed
to
be
soothing
him
like
a
careful
groom
quieting
an
excitable
horse
do
mind
them
she
said
you
will
go
away
after
a
time
and
make
a
place
for
yourself
out
in
the
he
wondered
how
she
knew
a
profound
respect
for
her
came
over
him
she
is
keen
to
guess
that
he
thought
he
began
to
talk
of
himself
boasting
and
throwing
out
his
chest
like
to
have
the
chance
to
show
what
i
can
do
he
declared
a
thought
that
had
been
in
his
mind
on
the
winter
day
when
uncle
charlie
wheeler
put
the
name
of
beaut
upon
him
came
back
and
he
walked
up
and
down
before
the
woman
making
grotesque
motions
with
his
hands
as
cracked
mcgregor
had
walked
up
and
down
before
him
i
tell
you
what
he
began
and
his
voice
was
harsh
he
had
forgotten
the
presence
of
the
woman
and
half
forgotten
what
had
been
in
his
mind
he
sputtered
and
glared
over
his
shoulder
up
the
hillside
as
he
struggled
for
words
oh
to
hell
with
men
he
burst
forth
they
are
cattle
stupid
a
fire
blazed
up
in
his
eyes
and
a
confident
ring
came
into
his
voice
i
like
to
get
them
together
all
of
them
he
said
i
like
to
make
them
words
failed
him
and
again
he
sat
down
on
the
log
beside
the
woman
well
i
like
to
lead
them
to
an
old
mine
shaft
and
push
them
in
he
concluded
resentfully
on
the
eminence
beaut
and
the
tall
woman
sat
and
looked
down
into
the
valley
i
wonder
why
we
do
go
there
mother
and
i
he
said
when
i
see
it
i
filled
with
the
notion
i
think
i
want
to
be
a
farmer
and
work
in
the
fields
instead
of
that
mother
and
i
sit
and
plan
of
the
city
i
going
to
be
a
lawyer
that
all
we
talk
about
then
i
come
up
here
and
it
seems
as
though
this
is
the
place
for
the
tall
woman
laughed
i
can
see
you
coming
home
at
night
from
the
fields
she
said
it
might
be
to
that
white
house
there
with
the
windmill
you
would
be
a
big
man
and
would
have
dust
in
your
red
hair
and
perhaps
a
red
beard
growing
on
your
chin
and
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
would
come
out
of
the
kitchen
door
to
stand
leaning
on
the
fence
waiting
for
you
when
you
came
up
she
would
put
her
arm
around
your
neck
and
kiss
you
on
the
lips
the
beard
would
tickle
her
cheek
you
should
have
a
beard
when
you
grow
older
your
mouth
is
so
a
strange
new
feeling
shot
through
beaut
he
wondered
why
she
had
said
that
and
wanted
to
take
hold
of
her
hand
and
kiss
her
then
and
there
he
got
up
and
looked
at
the
sun
going
down
behind
the
hill
far
away
at
the
other
end
of
the
valley
we
better
be
getting
along
back
he
said
the
woman
remained
seated
on
the
log
sit
down
she
said
i
tell
you
something
something
it
good
for
you
to
hear
you
so
big
and
red
you
tempt
a
girl
to
bother
you
first
though
you
tell
me
why
you
go
along
the
street
looking
into
the
gutter
when
i
stand
in
the
stairway
in
the
beaut
sat
down
again
upon
the
log
and
thought
of
what
the
boy
had
told
him
of
her
then
it
was
true
what
he
said
about
you
he
asked
no
no
she
cried
jumping
up
in
her
turn
and
beginning
to
pin
on
her
hat
let
be
beaut
sat
stolidly
on
the
log
what
the
use
bothering
each
other
he
said
let
sit
here
until
the
sun
goes
down
we
can
get
home
before
they
sat
down
and
she
began
talking
boasting
of
herself
as
he
had
boasted
of
his
father
i
too
old
for
that
boy
she
said
i
older
than
you
by
a
good
many
years
i
know
what
boys
talk
about
and
what
they
say
about
women
i
do
pretty
well
i
do
have
any
one
to
talk
to
except
father
and
he
sits
all
evening
reading
a
paper
and
going
to
sleep
in
his
chair
if
i
let
boys
come
and
sit
with
me
in
the
evening
or
stand
talking
with
me
in
the
stairway
it
is
because
i
lonesome
there
is
a
man
in
town
marry
not
the
speech
sounded
discordant
and
harsh
to
beaut
he
wished
his
father
were
there
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
muttering
rather
than
this
pale
woman
who
stirred
him
up
and
then
talked
harshly
like
the
women
at
the
back
doors
in
coal
creek
he
thought
again
as
he
had
thought
before
that
he
preferred
the
miners
drunk
and
silent
to
their
pale
talking
wives
on
an
impulse
he
told
her
that
saying
it
crudely
so
that
it
hurt
their
companionship
was
spoiled
they
got
up
and
began
to
climb
the
hill
going
toward
home
again
she
put
her
hand
to
her
side
and
again
he
wished
to
put
his
hand
at
her
back
and
push
her
up
the
hill
instead
he
walked
beside
her
in
silence
again
hating
the
town
halfway
down
the
hill
the
tall
woman
stopped
by
the
darkness
was
coming
on
and
the
glow
of
the
coke
ovens
lighted
the
sky
one
living
up
here
and
never
going
down
there
might
think
it
rather
grand
and
big
he
said
again
the
hatred
came
they
might
think
the
men
who
live
down
there
knew
something
instead
of
being
just
a
lot
of
a
smile
came
into
the
face
of
the
tall
woman
and
a
gentler
look
stole
into
her
eyes
we
get
at
one
another
she
said
we
ca
let
one
another
alone
i
wish
we
had
quarrelled
we
might
be
friends
if
we
tried
you
have
got
something
in
you
you
attract
women
i
heard
others
say
that
your
father
was
that
way
most
of
the
women
here
would
rather
have
been
the
wife
of
cracked
mcgregor
ugly
as
he
was
than
to
have
stayed
with
their
own
husbands
i
heard
my
mother
say
that
to
father
when
they
lay
quarrelling
in
bed
at
night
and
i
lay
the
boy
was
overcome
with
the
thought
of
a
woman
talking
to
him
so
frankly
he
looked
at
her
and
said
what
was
in
his
mind
i
like
the
women
he
said
but
i
liked
you
seeing
you
standing
in
the
stairway
and
thinking
you
had
been
doing
as
you
pleased
i
thought
maybe
you
amounted
to
something
i
do
know
why
you
should
be
bothered
by
what
i
think
i
do
know
why
any
woman
should
be
bothered
by
what
any
man
thinks
i
should
think
you
would
go
right
on
doing
what
you
want
to
do
like
mother
and
me
about
my
being
a
he
sat
on
a
log
beside
the
road
near
where
he
had
met
her
and
watched
her
go
down
the
hill
i
quite
a
fellow
to
have
talked
to
her
all
afternoon
like
that
he
thought
and
pride
in
his
growing
manhood
crept
over
him
chapter
iii
the
town
of
coal
creek
was
hideous
people
from
prosperous
towns
and
cities
of
the
middle
west
from
ohio
illinois
and
iowa
going
east
to
new
york
or
philadelphia
looked
out
of
the
car
windows
and
seeing
the
poor
little
houses
scattered
along
the
hillside
thought
of
books
they
had
read
of
life
in
hovels
in
the
old
world
in
men
and
women
leaned
back
and
closed
their
eyes
they
yawned
and
wished
the
journey
would
come
to
an
end
if
they
thought
of
the
town
at
all
they
regretted
it
mildly
and
passed
it
off
as
a
necessity
of
modern
life
the
houses
on
the
hillside
and
the
stores
along
main
street
belonged
to
the
mining
company
in
its
turn
the
mining
company
belonged
to
the
officials
of
the
railroad
the
manager
of
the
mine
had
a
brother
who
was
division
superintendent
it
was
the
mine
manager
who
had
stood
by
the
door
of
the
mine
when
cracked
mcgregor
went
to
his
death
he
lived
in
a
city
some
thirty
miles
away
and
went
there
in
the
evening
on
the
train
with
him
went
the
clerks
and
even
the
stenographers
from
the
offices
of
the
mine
after
five
in
the
afternoon
no
white
collars
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
streets
of
coal
creek
in
the
town
men
lived
like
brutes
dumb
with
toil
they
drank
greedily
in
the
saloon
on
main
street
and
went
home
to
beat
their
wives
among
them
a
constant
low
muttering
went
on
they
felt
the
injustice
of
their
lot
but
could
not
voice
it
logically
and
when
they
thought
of
the
men
who
owned
the
mine
they
swore
dumbly
using
vile
oaths
even
in
their
thoughts
occasionally
a
strike
broke
out
and
barney
butterlips
a
thin
little
man
with
a
cork
leg
stood
on
a
box
and
made
speeches
regarding
the
coming
brotherhood
of
man
once
a
troop
of
cavalry
was
unloaded
from
the
cars
and
with
a
battery
paraded
the
main
street
the
battery
was
made
up
of
several
men
in
brown
uniforms
they
set
up
a
gatling
gun
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
the
strike
subsided
an
italian
who
lived
in
a
house
on
the
hillside
cultivated
a
garden
his
place
was
the
one
beauty
spot
in
the
valley
with
a
wheelbarrow
he
brought
earth
from
the
woods
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
on
sunday
he
could
be
seen
going
back
and
forth
and
whistling
merrily
in
the
winter
he
sat
in
his
house
making
a
drawing
on
a
bit
of
paper
in
the
spring
he
took
the
drawing
and
by
it
planted
his
garden
utilising
every
inch
of
his
ground
when
a
strike
came
on
he
was
told
by
the
mine
manager
to
go
on
back
to
work
or
move
out
of
his
house
he
thought
of
the
garden
and
the
work
he
had
done
and
went
back
to
his
routine
of
work
in
the
mine
while
he
worked
the
miners
marched
up
the
hill
and
destroyed
the
garden
the
next
day
the
italian
also
joined
the
striking
miners
in
a
little
shack
on
the
hill
lived
an
old
woman
she
lived
alone
and
was
vilely
dirty
in
her
house
she
had
old
broken
chairs
and
tables
picked
up
about
town
and
piled
in
such
profusion
that
she
could
scarcely
move
about
on
warm
days
she
sat
in
the
sun
before
the
shack
chewing
on
a
stick
that
had
been
dipped
in
tobacco
miners
coming
up
the
hill
dumped
bits
of
bread
and
out
of
their
into
a
box
nailed
to
a
tree
by
the
road
these
the
old
woman
collected
and
ate
when
the
soldiers
came
to
town
she
walked
along
the
street
jeering
at
them
pretty
boys
scabs
dudes
clerks
she
called
after
them
as
she
walked
by
the
tails
of
their
horses
a
young
man
with
glasses
on
his
nose
who
was
mounted
on
a
grey
horse
turned
and
called
to
his
comrades
let
her
alone
it
old
mother
misery
when
the
tall
boy
looked
at
the
workers
and
at
the
old
woman
who
followed
the
soldiers
he
did
not
sympathise
with
them
he
hated
them
in
a
way
he
sympathised
with
the
soldiers
his
blood
was
stirred
by
the
sight
of
them
marching
shoulder
to
shoulder
he
thought
there
was
order
and
decency
in
the
rank
of
uniformed
men
moving
silently
and
quickly
along
and
he
half
wished
they
would
destroy
the
town
when
the
strikers
made
a
wreck
of
the
garden
of
the
italian
he
was
deeply
touched
and
walked
up
and
down
in
the
room
before
his
mother
proclaiming
himself
i
would
have
killed
them
had
it
been
my
garden
he
said
i
would
not
have
left
one
of
them
in
his
heart
he
like
cracked
mcgregor
nursed
his
hatred
of
the
miners
and
of
the
town
the
place
is
one
to
get
out
of
he
said
if
a
man
does
like
it
here
let
him
get
up
and
he
remembered
his
father
working
and
saving
for
the
farm
in
the
valley
they
thought
him
cracked
but
he
knew
more
than
they
they
would
not
have
dared
touch
a
garden
he
had
in
the
heart
of
the
miner
son
strange
thoughts
began
to
find
lodgings
remembering
in
his
dreams
at
night
the
moving
columns
of
men
in
their
uniforms
he
read
new
meaning
into
the
scraps
of
history
picked
up
in
the
school
and
the
movements
of
men
in
old
history
began
to
have
significance
for
him
on
a
summer
afternoon
as
he
loitered
before
the
town
hotel
beneath
which
was
the
saloon
and
billiard
room
where
the
boy
worked
he
overheard
two
men
talking
of
the
significance
of
men
one
of
the
men
was
an
itinerant
oculist
who
came
to
the
mining
town
once
a
month
to
fit
and
sell
spectacles
when
the
oculist
had
sold
several
pairs
of
spectacles
he
got
drunk
sometimes
staying
drunk
for
a
week
when
he
was
drunk
he
spoke
french
and
italian
and
sometimes
stood
in
the
barroom
before
the
miners
quoting
the
poems
of
dante
his
clothes
were
greasy
from
long
wear
and
he
had
a
huge
nose
streaked
with
red
and
purple
veins
because
of
his
learning
in
the
languages
and
his
quoting
of
poems
the
miners
thought
the
oculist
infinitely
wise
to
them
it
seemed
that
one
with
such
a
mind
must
have
almost
unearthly
knowledge
concerning
the
eyes
and
the
fitting
of
glasses
and
they
wore
with
pride
the
cheap
things
he
thrust
upon
them
occasionally
as
though
making
a
concession
to
his
patrons
the
oculist
spent
an
evening
among
them
once
after
reciting
one
of
the
sonnets
of
shakespeare
he
put
a
hand
on
the
bar
and
rocking
gently
back
and
forth
sang
in
a
voice
a
ballad
beginning
the
harp
that
once
through
tara
halls
the
soul
of
music
after
the
song
he
put
his
head
down
upon
the
bar
and
wept
while
the
miners
looked
on
touched
with
sympathy
on
the
summer
afternoon
when
beaut
mcgregor
listened
the
oculist
was
engaged
in
a
violent
quarrel
with
another
man
drunk
like
himself
the
second
man
was
a
slender
dandified
fellow
of
middle
age
who
sold
shoes
for
a
philadelphia
he
sat
in
a
chair
tilted
against
the
hotel
and
tried
to
read
aloud
from
a
book
when
he
was
fairly
launched
in
a
long
paragraph
the
oculist
interrupted
staggering
up
and
down
the
narrow
board
walk
before
the
hotel
the
old
drunkard
raved
and
swore
he
seemed
beside
himself
with
wrath
i
am
sick
of
such
slobbering
philosophy
he
declared
even
the
reading
of
it
makes
you
drool
at

do
not
say
the
words
sharply
and
they
ca
be
said
sharply
i
a
strong
man
spreading
his
legs
wide
apart
and
blowing
up
his
cheeks
the
oculist
beat
upon
his
breast
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
dismissed
the
man
in
the
chair
you
but
slobber
and
make
a
foul
noise
he
declared
i
know
your
kind
i
spit
upon
you
the
congress
at
washington
is
full
of
such
fellows
as
is
also
the
house
of
commons
in
england
in
france
they
were
once
in
charge
they
ran
things
in
france
until
the
coming
of
a
man
such
as
myself
they
were
lost
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
the
oculist
as
though
dismissing
the
dandified
man
from
his
mind
turned
to
address
beaut
he
talked
in
french
and
the
man
in
the
chair
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
i
am
like
napoleon
the
drunkard
declared
breaking
again
into
english
tears
began
to
show
in
his
eyes
i
take
the
money
of
these
miners
and
i
give
them
nothing
the
spectacles
i
sell
to
their
wives
for
five
dollars
cost
me
but
fifteen
cents
i
ride
over
these
brutes
as
napoleon
rode
over
europe
there
would
be
order
and
purpose
in
me

i
not
a
fool
i
am
like
napoleon
in
that
i
have
utter
contempt
for

and
again
the
words
of
the
drunkard
came
back
into
the
mind
of
the
mcgregor
boy
influencing
his
thoughts
grasping
nothing
of
the
philosophy
back
of
the
man
words
his
imagination
was
yet
touched
by
the
drunkard
tale
of
the
great
frenchman
babbled
into
his
ears
and
it
in
some
way
seemed
to
give
point
to
his
hatred
of
the
disorganised
ineffectiveness
of
the
life
about
him
after
nance
mcgregor
opened
the
bakery
another
strike
came
to
disturb
the
prosperity
of
the
business
again
the
miners
walked
idly
through
the
streets
into
the
bakery
they
came
to
get
bread
and
told
nance
to
write
the
debt
down
against
them
beaut
mcgregor
was
disturbed
he
saw
his
father
money
being
spent
for
flour
which
when
baked
into
loaves
went
out
of
the
shop
under
the
arms
of
the
miners
who
shuffled
as
they
walked
one
night
a
man
whose
name
appeared
on
their
books
followed
by
a
long
record
of
charged
loaves
came
reeling
past
the
bakery
mcgregor
went
to
his
mother
and
protested
they
have
money
to
get
drunk
he
said
let
them
pay
for
their
nance
mcgregor
went
on
trusting
the
miners
she
thought
of
the
women
and
children
in
the
houses
on
the
hill
and
when
she
heard
of
the
plans
of
the
mining
company
to
evict
the
miners
from
their
houses
she
shuddered
i
was
the
wife
of
a
miner
and
i
will
stick
to
them
she
thought
one
day
the
mine
manager
came
into
the
bakery
he
leaned
over
the
showcase
and
talked
to
nance
the
son
went
and
stood
by
his
side
to

to
be
stopped
the
manager
was
saying

the
building

to
us
they
did
not
appreciate
what
your
husband
did
and
why
should
you
ruin
yourself
for
them
the
woman
looked
at
him
and
answered
in
a
low
tone
full
of
resolution
they
thought
he
was
crazy
and
he
was
she
said
but
what
made
him
so
the
rotten
timbers
in
the
mine
that
broke
and
crushed
him

they
are
responsible
for
my
man
and
what
he
beaut
mcgregor
interrupted
well
i
think
he
is
right
he
declared
leaning
over
the
counter
beside
his
mother
and
looking
into
her
face
the
miners
do
want
better
things
for
their
families
they
want
more
money
to
get
drunk

doors

will
put

go
into
their
gullets
they
hated

and
he
hated
them
and
now

them

around
the
end
of
the
counter
and
went
with
the
mine
manager
to
the
door
he
locked
it
and
put
the
key
into
his
pocket
then
he
walked
to
the
rear
of
the
bake
shop
where
his
mother
sat
on
a
box
weeping
it
is
time
a
man
took
charge
here
he
said
nance
mcgregor
and
her
son

in
the
bakery
and
looked
at
each
other

along
the
street

from

said
the

over

on
the
floors
of
the

up
their
heads
and
howled
their
lives
were
a
succession
of
new
terrors
when
a
day
passed
that
a
new
terror
did
not
shake
them
they
went
to
bed
happy
when
the
miner
and
his
woman
stood
by
the
door
talking
in
low
tones
they
cried
expecting
to
be
put
to
bed
hungry
when
guarded
talk
did
not
go
on
by
the
door
the
miner
came
home
drunk
and
beat
the
mother
and
the
children
lay
in
beds
along
the
wall
trembling
with
fright
late
that
night
a
party
of

beat
upon

shouted

in
her
room
and
trembled
he
went
to
the
door
and
unlocking
it
stepped
out
the
miners

in
groups
on
the
wooden
sidewalk
and
in
the
mud
of
the
road
among
them
stood
the
old
crone
who
had
walked
beside
the
horses
and
shouted
at
the
soldiers
a
miner
with
a
black
beard

and
stood
before

shot
into

eyes
of
the
boy

walked
down
the
steps
and
stood
among
the
miners
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
he
peered
into
their
faces
when
he
spoke
his
voice
resounded
through
the
street

at
my

mcgregor
when

off
up
the
street

within

went
up
the
stairway
to
the
rooms
above
by
the
window
his
mother
sat
her
head
in
her
hands
looking
down
into
the
street
he
sat
in
a
chair
and
thought
of
the
situation
they
will
be
back
here
and
smash
the
place
like
they
tore
up
that
garden
he
said
the
next
evening
beaut
sat
in
the
darkness
on
the
steps
before
the
bakery
in
his
hands
he
held
a
hammer
a
dull
hatred
of
the
town
and
of
the
miners
burned
in
his
brain
i
will
make
it
hot
for
some
of
them
if
they
come
here
he
thought
he
hoped
they
would
come
as
he
looked
at
the
hammer
in
his
hand
a
phrase
from
the
lips
of
the
drunken
old
oculist
babbling
of
napoleon
came
into
his
mind
he
began
to
think
that
he
also
must
be
like
the
figure
of
which
the
drunkard
had
talked
he
remembered
a
story
the
oculist
had
told
of
a
fight
in
the
streets
of
a
european
city
and
muttered
and
waved
the
hammer
about
upstairs
his
mother
sat
by
the
window
with
her
head
in
her
hands
from
the
saloon
down
the
street
a
light
gleamed
out
on
the
wet
sidewalk
the
tall
pale
woman
who
had
gone
with
him
to
the
eminence
overlooking
the
valley
came
down
the
stairway
from
above
the
undertaker
shop
she
ran
along
the
sidewalk
on
her
head
she
wore
a
shawl
and
as
she
ran
she
clutched
it
with
her
hand
the
other
hand
she
held
against
her
side
when
the
women
reached
the
boy
who
sat
in
silence
before
the
bakery
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
plead
with
him
come
away
she
said
get
your
mother
and
come
to
our
place
they
going
to
smash
you
up
here

get
beaut
arose
and
pushed
her
away
her
coming
had
given
him
new
courage
his
heart
jumped
at
the
thought
of
her
interest
in
him
and
he
wished
that
the
miners
might
come
so
that
he
could
fight
them
before
her
i
wish
i
could
live
among
people
as
decent
as
she
he
thought
a
train
stopped
at
the
station
down
the
street
there
came
the
sound
of
tramping
of
men
and
quick
sharp
commands
a
stream
of
men
poured
out
of
the
saloon
onto
the
sidewalk
down
the
street
came
a
file
of
soldiers
with
guns
swung
across
their
shoulders
again
beaut
was
thrilled
by
the
sight
of
trained
orderly
men
moving
along
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
presence
of
these
men
the
disorganized
miners
seemed
pitifully
weak
and
insignificant
the
girl
pulled
the
shawl
about
her
head
and
ran
up
the
street
to
disappear
into
the
stairway
the
boy
unlocked
the
door
and
went
upstairs
and
to
bed
after
the
strike
nance
mcgregor
who
owned
nothing
but
unpaid
accounts
was
unable
to
open
the
bakery
a
small
man
with
a
white
moustache
who
chewed
tobacco
came
from
the
mill
and
took
the
unused
flour
and
shipped
it
away
the
boy
and
his
mother
continued
living
above
the
bakery

room
again
she
went
in
the
morning
to
wash
the
windows
and
scrub
the
floors
in
the
offices
of
the
mine
and
her
son
stood
upon
the
street
or
sat
in
the
pool
room
and
talked
to
the
boy
next
week
i
be
going
to
the
city
and
will
begin
making
something
of
myself
he
said
when
the
time
came
to
go
he
waited
and
idled
in
the
streets
once
when
a
miner
jeered
at
him
for
his
idleness
he
knocked
him
into
the
gutter
the
miners
who
hated
him
for
his
speech
on
the
steps
admired
him
for
his
strength
and
brute
courage

in

and
tried

upon

reading
a
book
as
he
sat
on
a
log
overlooking
the
town
a
shock
ran
through
mcgregor
when
he
looked
over
the
shoulder
of
the
man
and
saw
what
book
he
read
it
is
strange
he
thought
that
this
fellow
should
stick
to
the
same
book
that
fat
old
weeks
makes

living

sat
on
the
log
beside

and
watched

up
and
nodded
nervously
then
slid
along
the
log
to
the
farther
end

laughed
he
looked
down
at
the
town
and
then
at
the
frightened
nervous
man
on
the
log
an
inspiration
came
to
him
if
you
had
the
power

what

he
asked
the
nervous
man

and
tears
came
into
his
eyes

stood
before
the
log
and
spread
out
his
hands

go
among

cried
pitching
his
voice
forward
like
one
addressing
an
audience
poor
and
humble
i
would
go
teaching
them
of
spreading
out
his
hands
like

pronouncing
a
benediction

shouted

creek
i
would
teach
you

and
the
destruction

jumped
up
from
the
log
and
strode
before
the
trembling
figure
he
was
strangely
moved
grasping
the
man
he
thrust
him
back
upon
the
log
his
own
voice
rolled
down
the
hillside
in
a
great
roaring
laugh

shouted
mimicking
the
earnestness
of
hartnet

to
the
voice
of

ceased
speaking
and
jumping
over
the
logs
ran
down
the
road
among
the
first
of
the
miner
houses
he
stopped
and
laughed
awkwardly
i

cracked

he
thought
shouting
at
emptiness
on

went
on
in
a
reflective
mood
wondering

himself
loose
from
the
detaining
hand
and
went
on
down
the
hill
when
he
had
passed
out
of
sight
of
hartnet
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
for
an
hour
he
looked
at
the
town
in
the
valley
and
thought
of
himself
he
was
half
proud
half
ashamed
of
the
thing
that
had
happened
in
the
blue
eyes
of
mcgregor
anger
flashed
quick
and
sudden
upon
the
streets
of
coal
creek
he
walked
swinging
along
his
great
body
inspiring
fear
his
mother
grown
grave
and
silent
worked
in
the
offices
of
the
mines
again
she
had
a
habit
of
silence
in
her
own
home
and
looked
at
her
son
half
fearing
him
all
day
she
worked
in
the
mine
offices
and
in
the
evening
sat
silently
in
a
chair
on
the
porch
before
her
house
and
looked
down
into
main
street
beaut
mcgregor
did
nothing
he
sat
in
the
dingy
little
pool
room
and
talked

over

hills
swinging
a
stick
in
his
hand
and
thinking
of
the
city
to
which
he
would
presently
go
to
start
his
career
as
he
walked
in
the
streets
women
stopped
to
look
at
him
thinking
of
the
beauty
and
strength
of
his
maturing
body
the
miners
passed
him
in
silence
hating
him
and
dreading
his
wrath
walking
among
the
hills
he
thought
much
of
himself
i
am
capable
of
anything
he
thought
lifting
his
head
and
looking
at
the
towering
hills
i
wonder
why
i
stay
on
when
he
was
eighteen
beaut
mother
fell
all
day
she
lay
on
her
back
in
bed
in
the
room
above
the
empty
bakery
beaut
shook
himself
out
of
his
waking
stupor
and
went
about
seeking
work
he
had
not
felt
that
he
was
indolent
he
had
been
waiting
now
he
bestirred
himself
not
go
into
the
mines
he
said
nothing
shall
get
me
down
he
got
work
in
a
livery
stable
cleaning
and
feeding
the
horses
his
mother
got
out
of
bed
and
began
going
again
to
the
mine
offices
having
started
to
work
beaut
stayed
on
thinking
it
but
a
way
station
to
the
position
he
would
one
day
achieve
in
the
city
in
the
stable
worked
two
young
boys
sons
of
coal
miners
they
drove
travelling
men
from
the
trains
to
farming
towns
in
valleys
back
among
the
hills
and
in
the
evening
with
beaut
mcgregor
they
sat
on
a
bench
before
the
barn
and
shouted
at
people
going
past
the
stable
up
the
hill
the
livery
stable
in
coal
creek
was
owned
by
a
hunchback
named
weller
who
lived
in
the
city
and
went
home
at
night
during
the
day
he
sat
about
the
stable
talking
to
mcgregor
you
a
big
beast
he
said
laughing
you
talk
about
going
away
to
the
city
and
making
something
of
yourself
and
still
you
stay
on
here
doing
nothing
you
want
to
quit
this
talking
about
being
a
lawyer
and
become
a
prize
fighter
law
is
a
place
for
brains
not
he
walked
through
the
stables
leaning
his
head
to
one
side
and
looking
up
at
the
big
fellow
who
brushed
the
horses
mcgregor
watched
him
and
grinned
i
show
you
he
said
the
hunchback
was
pleased
when
he
strutted
before
mcgregor
he
had
heard
men
talk
of
the
strength
and
the
evil
temper
of
his
stableman
and
it
pleased
him
to
have
so
fierce
a
fellow
cleaning
the
horses
at
night
in
the
city
he
sat
under
the
lamp
with
his
wife
and
boasted
i
make
him
step
about
he
said
in
the
stable
the
hunchback
kept
at
the
heels
of
mcgregor
and
something
else
he
said
putting
his
hand
in
his
pockets
and
raising
himself
on
his
toes
you
look
out
for
that
undertaker
daughter
she
wants
you
if
she
gets
you
there
will
be
no
law
study
but
a
place
in
the
mines
for
you
you
let
her
alone
and
begin
taking
care
of
your
beaut
went
on
cleaning
the
horses
and
thinking
of
what
the
hunchback
had
said
he
thought
there
was
sense
to
it
he
also
was
afraid
of
the
tall
pale
girl
sometimes
when
he
looked
at
her
a
pain
shot
through
him
and
a
combination
of
fear
and
desire
gripped
him
he
walked
away
from
it
and
went
free
as
he
went
free
from
the
life
in
the
darkness
down
in
the
mine
he
has
a
kind
of
genius
for
keeping
away
from
the
things
he
like
said
the
liveryman
talking
to
uncle
charlie
wheeler
in
the
sun
before
the
door
of
the
post
office
one
afternoon
the
two
boys
who
worked
in
the
livery
stable
with
mcgregor
got
him
drunk
the
affair
was
a
rude
joke
elaborately
planned
the
hunchback
had
stayed
in
the
city
for
the
day
and
no
travelling
men
got
off
the
trains
to
be
driven
over
the
hills
in
the
afternoon
hay
brought
over
the
hill
from
the
fruitful
valley
was
being
put
into
the
loft
of
the
barn
and
between
loads
mcgregor
and
the
two
boys
sat
on
the
bench
by
the
stable
door
the
two
boys
went
to
the
saloon
and
brought
back
beer
paying
for
it
from
a
fund
kept
for
that
purpose
the
fund
was
the
result
of
a
system
worked
out
by
the
two
drivers
when
a
passenger
gave
one
of
them
a
coin
at
the
end
of
a
day
of
driving
he
put
it
into
the
common
fund
when
the
fund
had
grown
to
some
size
the
two
went
to
the
saloon
and
stood
before
the
bar
drinking
until
it
was
spent
and
then
came
back
to
sleep
off
their
stupor
on
the
hay
in
the
barn
after
a
prosperous
week
the
hunchback
occasionally
gave
them
a
dollar
for
the
fund
of
the
beer
mcgregor
drank
but
one
foaming
glass
for
all
his
idling
about
coal
creek
he
had
never
before
tasted
beer
and
it
was
strong
and
bitter
in
his
mouth
he
threw
up
his
head
and
gulped
it
then
turned
and
walked
toward
the
rear
of
the
stable
to
conceal
the
tears
that
the
taste
of
the
stuff
had
forced
into
his
eyes
the
two
drivers
sat
on
the
bench
and
laughed
the
drink
they
had
given
beaut
was
a
horrible
mess
concocted
by
the
laughing
bartender
at
their
suggestion
we
will
get
the
big
fellow
drunk
and
hear
him
roar
the
bartender
had
said
as
he
walked
toward
the
back
of
the
stable
a
convulsive
nausea
seized
beaut
he
stumbled
and
pitched
forward
cutting
his
face
on
the
floor
then
he
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
groaned
and
a
little
stream
of
blood
ran
down
his
cheek
the
two
boys
jumped
up
from
the
bench
and
ran
toward
him
they
stood
looking
at
his
pale
lips
fear
seized
them
they
tried
to
lift
him
but
he
fell
from
their
arms
and
lay
again
on
the
stable
floor
white
and
motionless
filled
with
fright
they
ran
from
the
stable
and
through
main
street
we
must
get
a
doctor
they
said
as
they
hurried
along
he
is
mighty
sick
that
in
the
doorway
leading
to
the
rooms
over
the
undertaker
shop
stood
the
tall
pale
girl
one
of
the
running
boys
stopped
and
addressed
her
your
he
shouted
is
blind
drunk
lying
on
the
stable
floor
he
has
cut
his
head
and
is
the
tall
girl
ran
down
the
street
to
the
offices
of
the
mine
with
nance
mcgregor
she
hurried
to
the
stable
the
store
keepers
along
main
street
looked
out
of
their
doors
and
saw
the
two
women
pale
and
with
set
faces
the
huge
form
of
beaut
mcgregor
along
the
street
and
in
at
the
door
of
the
bakery
at
eight
that
evening
beaut
mcgregor
his
legs
still
unsteady
his
face
white
climbed
aboard
a
passenger
train
and
passed
out
of
the
life
of
coal
creek
on
the
seat
beside
him
a
bag
contained
all
his
clothes
in
his
pocket
lay
a
ticket
to
chicago
and
dollars
the
last
of
cracked
mcgregor
savings
he
looked
out
of
the
car
window
at
the
little
woman
thin
and
worn
standing
alone
on
the
station
platform
and
a
great
wave
of
anger
passed
through
him
i
show
them
he
muttered
the
woman
looked
at
him
and
forced
a
smile
to
her
lips
the
train
began
to
move
into
the
west
beaut
looked
at
his
mother
and
at
the
deserted
streets
of
coal
creek
and
put
his
head
down
upon
his
hands
and
in
the
crowded
car
before
the
gaping
people
wept
with
joy
that
he
had
seen
the
last
of
youth
he
looked
back
at
coal
creek
full
of
hate
like
nero
he
might
have
wished
that
all
of
the
people
of
the
town
had
but
one
head
so
that
he
might
have
cut
it
off
with
a
sweep
of
a
sword
or
knocked
it
into
the
gutter

swinging

that
city
the
big
exposition
of
the

had
brought
multiplied
thousands
of
restless

into

its
leading
citizens

had
clamoured
for

and
had
loudly
talked

that
was
to
come

to
do
with
the
growth
now
that
it
had
come
the
depression
that
followed
on
the
heels
of
the
great
show
and
the
financial
panic
that
ran
over
the
country
in
that
year
had
set
thousands
of
hungry
men
to
wait
dumbly
on
park
benches
poring
over
want
advertisements
in
the
daily
papers
and
looking
vacantly
at
the

forth

knocking

their

looked
into
the
hungry
distorted
faces
of
five
hundred
men
clamouring
for
a

mcgregor

huge
graceless

indolent

untrained

hating
the
world
within
two
days
he
had
snatched
before
the
very
eyes
of
that
hungry
marching
army
three
prizes
three
places
where
a
man
might
by
working
all
day
get
clothes
to
wear
upon
his
back
and
food
to
put
into
his
stomach
in
a
way
mcgregor
had
already
sensed
something
the
realisation
of
which
will
go
far
toward
making
any
man
a
strong
figure
in
the
world
he
was
not
to
be
bullied
with
words
orators
might
have
preached
to
him
all
day
about
the
progress
of
mankind
in
america
flags
might
have
been
flapped
and
newspapers
might
have
dinned
the
wonders
of
his
country
into
his
brain
he
would
only
have
shaken
his
big
head
he
did
not
yet
know
the
whole
story
of
how
men
coming
out
of
europe
and
given
millions
of
square
miles
of
black
fertile
land
mines
and
forests
have
failed
in
the
challenge
given
them
by
fate
and
have
produced
out
of
the
stately
order
of
nature
only
the
sordid
disorder
of
man
mcgregor
did
not
know
the
fullness
of
the
tragic
story
of
his
race
he
only
knew
that
the
men
he
had
seen
were
for
the
most
part
pigmies
on
the
train
coming
to
chicago
a
change
had
come
over
him
the
hatred
of
coal
creek
that
burned
in
him
had
set
fire
to
something
else
he
sat
looking
out
of
the
car
window
at
the
stations
running
past
during
the
night
and
the
following
day
at
the
cornfields
of
indiana
making
his
plans
in
chicago
he
meant
to
do
something
coming
from
a
community
where
no
man
arose
above
a
condition
of
silent
brute
labour
he
meant
to
step
up
into
the
light
of
power
filled
with
hatred
and
contempt
of
mankind
he
meant
that
mankind
should
serve
him
raised
among
men
who
were
but
men
he
meant
to
be
a
master
and
his
equipment
was
better
than
he
knew
in
a
disorderly
haphazard
world
hatred
is
as
effective
an
impulse
to
drive
men
forward
to
success
as
love
and
high
hope
it
is
a
impulse
sleeping
in
the
heart
of
man
since
the
day
of
cain
in
a
way
it
rings
true
and
strong
above
the
hideous
jangle
of
modern
life
inspiring
fear
it
usurps
power
mcgregor
was
without
fear
he
had
not
yet
met
his
master
and
looked
with
contempt
upon
the
men
and
women
he
had
known
without
knowing
it
he
had
besides
a
huge
body
hard
as
adamant
a
clear
and
lucid
brain
the
fact
that
he
hated
coal
creek
and
thought
it
horrible
proved
his
keenness
it
was
horrible
well
might
chicago
have
trembled
and
rich
men
strolling
in
the
evening
along
michigan
boulevard
have
looked
fearfully
about
as
this
huge
red
fellow
carrying
the
cheap
handbag
and
staring
with
his
blue
eyes
at
the
restless
moving
mobs
of
people
walked
for
the
first
time
through
its
streets
in
his
very
frame
there
was
the
possibility
of
something
a
blow
a
shock
a
thrust
out
of
the
lean
soul
of
strength
into
the
fleshiness
of
weakness
in
the
world
of
men
nothing
is
so
rare
as
a
knowledge
of
men
christ
himself
found
the
merchants
hawking
their
wares
even
on
the
floor
of
the
temple
and
in
his
naive
youth
was
stirred
to
wrath
and
drove
them
through
the
door
like
flies
and
history
has
represented
him
in
turn
as
a
man
of
peace
so
that
after
these
centuries
the
temples
are
again
supported
by
the
hawking
of
wares
and
his
fine
boyish
wrath
is
forgotten
in
france
after
the
great
revolution
and
the
babbling
of
many
voices
talking
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
it
wanted
but
a
short
and
very
determined
man
with
an
instinctive
knowledge
of
drums
of
cannons
and
of
stirring
words
to
send
the
same
babblers
screaming
across
open
spaces
stumbling
through
ditches
and
pitching
headlong
into
the
arms
of
death
in
the
interest
of
one
who
believed
not
at
all
in
the
brotherhood
of
man
they
who
had
wept
at
the
mention
of
the
word
brotherhood
died
fighting
brothers
in
the
heart
of
all
men
lies
sleeping
the
love
of
order
how
to
achieve
order
out
of
our
strange
jumble
of
forms
out
of
democracies
and
monarchies
dreams
and
endeavours
is
the
riddle
of
the
universe
and
the
thing
that
in
the
artist
is
called
the
passion
for
form
and
for
which
he
also
will
laugh
in
the
face
of
death
is
in
all
men
by
grasping
that
fact
caesar
alexander
napoleon
and
our
own
grant
have
made
heroes
of
the
dullest
clods
that
walk
and
not
a
man
of
all
the
thousands
who
marched
with
sherman
to
the
sea
but
lived
the
rest
of
his
life
with
a
something
sweeter
braver
and
finer
sleeping
in
his
soul
than
will
ever
be
produced
by
the
reformer
scolding
of
brotherhood
from
a
the
long
march
the
burning
of
the
throat
and
the
stinging
of
the
dust
in
the
nostrils
the
touch
of
shoulder
against
shoulder
the
quick
bond
of
a
common
unquestioned
instinctive
passion
that
bursts
in
the
orgasm
of
battle
the
forgetting
of
words
and
the
doing
of
the
thing
be
it
winning
battles
or
destroying
ugliness
the
passionate
massing
of
men
for
accomplishment
these
are
the
signs
if
they
ever
awake
in
our
land
by
which
you
may
know
you
have
come
to
the
days
of
the
making
of
men
in
chicago
in
and
in
the
men
who
went
aimlessly
seeking
work
in
the
streets
of
chicago
in
that
year
there
were
none
of
these
signs
like
the
coal
mining
town
from
which
beaut
mcgregor
had
come
the
city
lay
sprawling
and
ineffective
before
him
a
tawdry
disorderly
dwelling
for
millions
of
men
built
not
for
the
making
of
men
but
for
the
making
of
millions
by
a
few
odd
and
drygoods
merchants
with
a
slight
lifting
of
his
great
shoulders
mcgregor
sensed
these
things
although
he
could
not
have
expressed
his
sense
of
them
and
the
hatred
and
contempt
of
men
born
of
his
youth
in
the
mining
town
was
rekindled
by
the
sight
of
city
men
wandering
afraid
and
bewildered
through
the
streets
of
their
own
city
knowing
nothing
of
the
customs
of
the
unemployed
mcgregor
did
not
walk
the
streets
looking
for
signs
marked
men
he
did
not
sit
on
park
benches
studying
want
advertisements
the
want
advertisements
that
so
often
proved
but
bait
put
out
by
suave
men
up
dirty
stairways
to
glean
the
last
few
pennies
from
pockets
of
the
needy
going
along
the
street
he
swung
his
great
body
through
the
doorways
leading
to
the
offices
of
factories
when
some
pert
young
man
tried
to
stop
him
he
did
not
say
words
but
drew
back
his
fist
threateningly
and
glowering
walked
in
the
young
men
at
the
doors
of
factories
looked
at
his
blue
eyes
and
let
him
pass
unchallenged
in
the
afternoon
of
his
first
day
of
seeking
beaut
got
a
place
in
an
apple
warehouse
on
the
north
side
the
third
place
offered
him
during
the
day
and
the
one
that
he
accepted
the
chance
came
to
him
through
an
exhibition
of
strength
two
men
old
and
bent
struggled
to
get
a
barrel
of
apples
from
the
sidewalk
up
to
a
platform
that
ran
waist
high
along
the
front
of
the
warehouse
the
barrel
had
rolled
to
the
sidewalk
from
a
truck
standing
in
the
gutter
the
driver
of
the
truck
stood
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
laughing
a
german
with
blond
hair
stood
upon
the
platform
swearing
in
broken
english
mcgregor
stood
upon
the
sidewalk
and
looked
at
the
two
men
who
were
struggling
with
the
barrel
a
feeling
of
immense
contempt
for
their
feebleness
shone
in
his
eyes
pushing
them
aside
he
grasped
the
barrel
and
with
a
great
heave
sent
it
up
onto
the
platform
and
spinning
through
an
open
doorway
into
the
receiving
room
of
the
warehouse
the
two
workmen
stood
on
the
sidewalk
smiling
sheepishly
across
the
street
a
group
of
city
firemen
who
lounged
in
the
sun
before
an
engine
house
clapped
their
hands
the
truck
driver
turned
and
prepared
to
send
another
barrel
along
the
plank
extending
from
the
truck
across
the
sidewalk
to
the
warehouse
platform
at
a
window
in
the
upper
part
of
the
warehouse
a
grey
head
protruded
and
a
sharp
voice
called
down
to
the
tall
german
hey
frank
hire
that
and
let
about
six
of
the
dead
ones
you
got
around
here
go
mcgregor
jumped
upon
the
platform
and
walked
in
at
the
warehouse
door
the
german
followed
inventorying
the
size
of
the
giant
with
something
like
disapproval
his
look
seemed
to
say
i
like
strong
fellows
but
you
too
he
took
the
discomfiture
of
the
two
feeble
workmen
on
the
sidewalk
as
in
some
way
reflecting
upon
himself
the
two
men
stood
in
the
receiving
room
and
looked
at
each
other
a
bystander
might
have
thought
them
preparing
to
fight
and
then
a
freight
elevator
came
slowly
down
from
the
upper
part
of
the
warehouse
and
from
it
jumped
a
small
man
with
a
yard
stick
in
his
hand
he
had
a
sharp
restless
eye
and
a
short
stubby
grey
beard
striking
the
floor
with
a
bound
he
began
to
talk
we
pay
two
dollars
for
nine
hours
work
here
begin
at
seven
quit
at
five
will
you
come
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
turned
to
the
german
tell
those
two
old
to
get
their
time
and
get
out
of
here
he
said
turning
again
and
looking
expectantly
at
mcgregor
mcgregor
liked
the
quick
little
man
and
grinned
with
approval
of
his
decisiveness
he
nodded
his
assent
to
the
proposal
and
looking
at
the
german
laughed
the
little
man
disappeared
through
a
door
leading
to
an
office
and
mcgregor
walked
out
into
the
street
at
a
corner
he
turned
and
saw
the
german
standing
on
the
platform
before
the
warehouse
looking
after
him
he
is
wondering
whether
or
not
he
can
whip
me
thought
mcgregor
in
the
apple
warehouse
mcgregor
worked
for
three
years
rising
during
his
second
year
to
be
foreman
and
replacing
the
tall
german
the
german
expected
trouble
with
mcgregor
and
was
determined
to
make
short
work
of
him
he
had
been
offended
by
the
action
of
the
superintendent
in
hiring
the
man
and
felt
that
a
prerogative
belonging
to
himself
had
been
ignored
all
day
he
followed
mcgregor
with
his
eyes
trying
to
calculate
the
strength
and
courage
in
the
huge
body
he
knew
that
hundreds
of
hungry
men
walked
the
streets
and
in
the
end
decided
that
the
need
of
work
if
not
the
spirit
of
the
man
would
make
him
submissive
during
the
second
week
he
put
the
question
that
burned
in
his
brain
to
the
test
he
followed
mcgregor
into
a
upper
room
where
barrels
of
apples
piled
to
the
ceiling
left
only
narrow
ways
for
passage
standing
in
the
he
shouted
calling
the
man
who
worked
among
the
apple
barrels
a
foul
name
i
wo
have
you
loafing
in
there
you
bastard
he
shouted
mcgregor
said
nothing
he
was
not
offended
by
the
vileness
of
the
name
the
german
had
called
him
and
took
it
merely
as
a
challenge
that
he
had
been
expecting
and
that
he
meant
to
accept
with
a
grim
smile
on
his
lips
he
walked
toward
the
german
and
when
but
one
apple
barrel
lay
between
them
reached
across
and
dragged
the
foreman
sputtering
and
swearing
down
the
passageway
to
a
window
at
the
end
of
the
room
by
the
window
he
stopped
and
putting
his
hand
to
the
throat
of
the
struggling
man
began
to
choke
him
into
submission
blows
fell
on
his
face
and
body
struggling
terribly
the
german
kicked
mcgregor
legs
with
desperate
energy
although
his
ears
rang
with
the
blows
that
fell
about
his
neck
and
cheeks
mcgregor
stool
silent
under
the
storm
his
blue
eyes
gleamed
with
hatred
and
the
muscles
of
his
great
arms
danced
in
the
light
from
the
window
as
he
looked
into
the
protruding
eyes
of
the
writhing
german
he
thought
of
fat
reverend
minot
weeks
of
coal
creek
and
added
an
extra
twitch
to
the
flesh
between
his
fingers
when
a
gesture
of
submission
came
from
the
man
against
the
wall
he
stepped
back
and
let
go
his
grip
the
german
dropped
to
the
floor
standing
over
him
mcgregor
delivered
his
ultimatum
you
report
this
or
try
to
get
me
fired
and
i
kill
you
outright
he
said
i
going
to
stay
here
on
this
job
until
i
get
ready
to
leave
it
you
can
tell
me
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
but
when
you
speak
to
me
again
say
mcgregor
that
my
the
german
got
to
his
feet
and
began
walking
down
the
passageway
between
the
rows
of
piled
barrels
as
he
went
he
helped
himself
along
with
his
hands
mcgregor
went
back
to
work
after
the
retreating
form
of
the
german
he
shouted
get
a
new
place
when
you
can
dutch
i
be
taking
this
job
away
from
you
when
i
ready
for
that
evening
as
mcgregor
walked
to
the
car
he
saw
the
little
superintendent
standing
waiting
for
him
before
a
saloon
the
man
made
a
sign
and
mcgregor
walked
across
and
stood
beside
him
they
went
together
into
the
saloon
and
stood
leaning
against
the
bar
and
looked
at
each
other
a
smile
played
about
the
lips
of
the
little
man
what
have
you
been
doing
to
frank
he
asked
mcgregor
turned
to
the
bartender
who
stood
waiting
before
him
he
thought
that
the
superintendent
intended
to
try
to
patronise
him
by
buying
him
a
drink
and
he
did
not
like
the
thought
what
will
you
have
i
take
a
cigar
for
mine
he
said
quickly
defeating
the
superintendent
plan
by
being
the
first
to
speak
when
the
bartender
brought
the
cigars
mcgregor
paid
for
them
and
walked
out
at
the
door
he
felt
like
one
playing
a
game
if
frank
meant
to
bully
me
into
submission
this
man
also
means
on
the
sidewalk
before
the
saloon
mcgregor
stopped
look
here
he
said
turning
and
facing
the
superintendent
i
after
frank
place
i
going
to
learn
the
business
as
fast
as
i
can
i
wo
put
it
up
to
you
to
fire
him
when
i
get
ready
for
the
place
he
wo
be
a
light
flashed
into
the
eyes
of
the
little
man
he
held
the
cigar
mcgregor
had
paid
for
as
though
about
to
throw
it
into
the
street
how
far
do
you
think
you
can
go
with
your
big
fists
he
asked
his
voice
rising
mcgregor
smiled
he
thought
he
had
earned
another
victory
and
lighting
his
cigar
held
the
burning
match
before
the
little
man
brains
are
intended
to
help
fists
he
said
i
got
the
superintendent
looked
at
the
burning
match
and
at
the
cigar
between
his
fingers
if
i
do
which
will
you
use
on
me
he
asked
mcgregor
threw
the
match
into
the
street
aw
do
bother
asking
he
said
holding
out
another
match
mcgregor
and
the
superintendent
walked
along
the
street
i
would
like
to
fire
you
but
i
wo
some
day
you
run
that
warehouse
like
a
clock
said
the
superintendent
mcgregor
sat
in
the
and
thought
of
his
day
it
had
been
he
felt
a
day
of
two
battles
first
the
direct
brutal
battle
of
fists
in
the
passageway
and
then
this
other
battle
with
the
superintendent
he
thought
he
had
won
both
fights
of
the
fight
with
the
tall
german
he
thought
little
he
had
expected
to
win
that
the
other
was
different
the
superintendent
he
felt
had
wanted
to
patronise
him
patting
him
on
the
back
and
buying
him
drinks
instead
he
had
patronised
the
superintendent
a
battle
had
gone
on
in
the
brains
of
the
two
men
and
he
had
won
he
had
met
a
new
kind
of
man
one
who
did
not
live
by
the
raw
strength
of
his
muscles
and
he
had
given
a
good
account
of
himself
the
conviction
that
he
had
besides
a
good
pair
of
fists
a
good
brain
swept
in
on
him
glorifying
him
he
thought
of
the
sentence
brains
are
intended
to
help
fists
and
wondered
how
he
had
happened
to
think
of
it
chapter
ii
the
street
in
which
mcgregor
lived
in
chicago
was
called
wycliff
place
after
a
family
of
that
name
that
had
once
owned
the
land
thereabout
the
street
was
complete
in
its
hideousness
nothing
more
unlovely
could
be
imagined
given
a
free
hand
an
indiscriminate
lot
of
badly
trained
carpenters
and
bricklayers
had
builded
houses
beside
the
cobblestone
road
that
touched
the
fantastic
in
their
unsightliness
and
inconvenience
the
great
west
side
of
chicago
has
hundreds
of
such
streets
and
the
coal
mining
town
out
of
which
mcgregor
had
come
was
more
inspiring
as
a
place
in
which
to
live
as
an
unemployed
young
man
not
much
given
to
chance
companionships
beaut
had
spent
many
long
evenings
wandering
alone
on
the
hillsides
above
his
home
town
there
was
a
kind
of
dreadful
loveliness
about
the
place
at
night
the
long
black
valley
with
its
dense
shroud
of
smoke
that
rose
and
fell
and
formed
itself
into
fantastic
shapes
in
the
moonlight
the
poor
little
houses
clinging
to
the
hillside
the
occasional
cry
of
a
woman
being
beaten
by
a
drunken
husband
the
glare
of
the
coke
fires
and
the
rumble
of
coal
cars
being
pushed
along
the
railroad
tracks
all
of
these
made
a
grim
and
rather
inspiring
impression
on
the
young
man
mind
so
that
although
he
hated
the
mines
and
the
miners
he
sometimes
paused
in
his
night
wanderings
and
stood
with
his
great
shoulders
lifted
breathing
deeply
and
feeling
things
he
had
no
words
in
him
to
express
in
wycliff
place
mcgregor
got
no
such
reactions
foul
dust
filled
the
air
all
day
the
street
rumbled
and
roared
under
the
wheels
of
trucks
and
light
hurrying
delivery
wagons
soot
from
the
factory
chimneys
was
caught
up
by
the
wind
and
having
been
mixed
with
powdered
horse
manure
from
the
roadway
flew
into
the
eyes
and
the
nostrils
of
pedestrians
always
a
babble
of
voices
went
on
at
a
corner
saloon
teamsters
stopped
to
have
their
drinking
cans
filled
with
beer
and
stood
about
swearing
and
shouting
in
the
evening
women
and
children
went
back
and
forth
from
their
houses
carrying
beer
in
pitchers
from
the
same
saloon
dogs
howled
and
fought
drunken
men
reeled
along
the
sidewalk
and
the
women
of
the
town
appeared
in
their
cheap
finery
and
paraded
before
the
idlers
about
the
saloon
door
the
woman
who
rented
the
room
to
mcgregor
boasted
to
him
of
wycliff
blood
it
was
that
she
told
him
that
had
brought
her
to
chicago
from
her
home
at
cairo
illinois
the
place
was
left
to
me
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
with
it
i
came
here
to
live
she
said
she
explained
to
him
that
the
wycliffs
had
been
people
of
note
in
the
early
history
of
chicago
the
huge
old
house
with
the
cracked
stone
steps
and
the
rooms
to
rent
sign
in
the
window
had
once
been
their
family
seat
the
history
of
this
woman
was
characteristic
of
the
quality
of
much
of
american
life
she
was
at
bottom
a
wholesome
creature
who
should
have
lived
in
a
neat
frame
house
in
a
village
and
tended
a
garden
on
sunday
she
should
have
dressed
herself
with
care
and
gone
off
to
sit
in
a
country
church
with
her
hands
crossed
and
her
soul
at
rest
the
thought
of
owning
a
house
in
the
city
had
however
paralysed
her
brain
the
house
itself
was
worth
a
certain
number
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
her
mind
could
not
rise
above
that
fact
so
her
good
broad
face
had
become
grimy
with
city
dirt
and
her
body
weary
from
the
endless
toil
of
caring
for
roomers
on
summer
evenings
she
sat
on
the
steps
before
her
house
clad
in
some
bit
of
wycliff
finery
taken
from
a
trunk
in
the
attic
and
when
a
lodger
came
out
at
the
door
she
looked
at
him
wistfully
and
said
on
such
a
night
as
this
you
could
hear
the
whistles
on
the
river
steamers
in
mcgregor
lived
in
a
small
room
at
the
end
of
a
tall
on
the
second
floor
of
the
wycliff
house
the
windows
of
the
room
looked
down
into
a
dirty
little
court
almost
surrounded
by
brick
warehouses
the
room
was
furnished
with
a
bed
a
chair
that
was
always
threatening
to
come
to
pieces
and
a
desk
with
weak
carved
legs
in
this
room
sat
mcgregor
night
after
night
striving
to
realise
his
coal
creek
dream
of
training
his
mind
and
making
himself
of
some
account
in
the
world
from
until
he
sat
at
a
desk
in
a
night
school
from
ten
until
midnight
he
read
in
his
room
he
did
not
think
of
his
surroundings
of
the
vast
disorder
of
life
about
him
but
tried
with
all
his
strength
to
bring
something
like
order
and
purpose
into
his
own
mind
and
his
own
life
in
the
little
court
under
the
window
lay
heaps
of
discarded
newspaper
tossed
about
by
the
wind
there
in
the
heart
of
the
city
walled
in
by
the
brick
warehouse
and
half
concealed
under
piles
of
chair
legs
cans
and
broken
bottles
lay
two
logs
in
their
time
no
doubt
a
part
of
the
grove
that
once
lay
about
the
house
the
neighbourhood
had
passed
so
rapidly
from
country
estate
to
homes
and
from
homes
to
rented
lodgings
and
huge
brick
warehouses
that
the
marks
of
the
lumberman
axe
still
showed
in
the
butts
of
the
logs
mcgregor
seldom
saw
the
little
court
except
when
its
ugliness
was
refined
and
glossed
over
by
darkness
or
by
the
moonlight
on
hot
evenings
he
laid
down
his
book
and
leaning
far
out
of
the
window
rubbed
his
eyes
and
watched
the
discarded
newspapers
worried
by
the
whirlpools
of
wind
in
the
court
run
here
and
there
dashing
against
the
warehouse
walls
and
vainly
trying
to
escape
over
the
roof
the
sight
fascinated
him
and
brought
a
thought
into
his
mind
he
began
to
think
that
the
lives
of
most
of
the
people
about
him
were
much
like
the
dirty
newspaper
harried
by
adverse
winds
and
surrounded
by
ugly
walls
of
facts
the
thought
drove
him
from
the
window
to
renewed
effort
among
his
books
i
do
something
here
anyway
i
show
them
he
growled
one
living
in
the
house
with
mcgregor
during
those
first
years
in
the
city
might
have
thought
his
life
stupid
and
commonplace
but
to
him
it
did
not
seem
so
it
was
for
the
miner
son
a
time
of
sudden
and
tremendous
growth
filled
with
confidence
in
the
strength
and
quickness
of
his
body
he
was
beginning
to
have
also
confidence
in
the
vigour
and
clearness
of
his
brain
in
the
warehouse
he
went
about
with
eyes
and
ears
open
devising
in
his
mind
new
methods
of
moving
goods
watching
the
men
at
work
marking
the
shirkers
preparing
to
pounce
upon
the
tall
german
place
as
foreman
the
superintendent
of
the
warehouse
not
understanding
the
turn
of
the
talk
with
mcgregor
on
the
sidewalk
before
the
saloon
decided
to
like
him
and
laughed
when
they
met
in
the
warehouse
the
tall
german
maintained
a
policy
of
sullen
silence
and
went
to
laborious
lengths
to
avoid
addressing
him
in
his
room
at
night
mcgregor
began
to
read
law
reading
each
page
over
and
over
and
thinking
of
what
he
had
read
through
the
next
day
as
he
rolled
and
piled
apple
barrels
in
the
passages
in
the
warehouse
mcgregor
had
an
aptitude
and
an
appetite
for
facts
he
read
law
as
another
and
gentler
nature
might
have
read
poetry
or
old
legends
what
he
read
at
night
he
remembered
and
thought
about
during
the
day
he
had
no
dream
of
the
glories
of
the
law
the
fact
that
these
rules
laid
down
by
men
to
govern
their
social
organisation
were
the
result
of
ages
of
striving
toward
perfection
did
not
greatly
interest
him
and
he
only
thought
of
them
as
weapons
with
which
to
attack
and
defend
in
the
battle
of
brains
he
meant
presently
to
fight
his
mind
gloated
in
anticipation
of
the
battle
chapter
iii
and
then
a
new
element
asserted
itself
in
the
life
of
mcgregor
one
of
the
hundreds
of
disintegrating
forces
that
attack
strong
natures
striving
to
scatter
their
force
in
the
back
currents
of
life
attacked
him
his
big
body
began
to
feel
with
enervating
persistency
the
call
of
sex
in
the
house
in
wycliff
place
mcgregor
passed
as
a
mystery
by
keeping
silence
he
won
a
reputation
for
wisdom
the
clerks
in
the
hall
bedrooms
thought
him
a
scientist
the
woman
from
cairo
thought
him
a
theological
student
down
the
hall
a
pretty
girl
with
large
black
eyes
who
worked
in
a
department
store
down
town
dreamed
of
him
at
night
when
in
the
evening
he
banged
the
door
to
his
room
and
strode
down
the
hallway
going
to
the
night
school
she
sat
in
a
chair
by
the
open
door
of
her
room
as
he
passed
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
boldly
when
he
returned
she
was
again
by
the
door
and
again
she
looked
boldly
at
him
in
his
room
after
the
meetings
with
the
girl
mcgregor
found
difficulty
in
keeping
his
mind
on
the
reading
he
felt
as
he
had
felt
with
the
pale
girl
on
the
hillside
beyond
coal
creek
with
her
as
with
the
pale
girl
he
felt
the
need
of
defending
himself
he
began
to
make
it
a
practice
to
hurry
along
past
her
door
the
girl
in
the
hall
bedroom
thought
constantly
of
mcgregor
when
he
had
gone
to
night
school
another
young
man
of
the
house
who
wore
a
panama
hat
came
from
the
floor
above
and
putting
his
hands
on
the
door
frames
of
her
room
stood
looking
at
her
and
talking
in
his
lips
he
held
a
cigarette
which
when
he
talked
hung
limply
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
this
young
man
and
the
girl
kept
up
a
continuous
stream
of
comments
on
the
doings
of
mcgregor
begun
by
the
young
man
who
hated
him
because
of
his
silence
the
subject
was
kept
alive
by
the
girl
who
wanted
to
talk
of
mcgregor
on
saturday
nights
the
young
man
and
the
girl
sometimes
went
together
to
the
theatre
one
night
in
the
summer
when
they
had
returned
to
the
front
of
the
house
the
girl
stopped
let
see
what
the
big
is
doing
she
said
going
around
the
block
they
stole
in
the
darkness
down
an
alleyway
and
stood
in
the
little
dirty
court
looking
up
at
mcgregor
who
with
his
feet
in
the
window
and
a
lamp
burning
at
his
shoulder
sat
in
his
room
reading
when
they
returned
to
the
front
of
the
house
the
girl
kissed
the
young
man
closing
her
eyes
and
thinking
of
mcgregor
in
her
room
later
she
lay
abed
dreaming
she
imagined
herself
assaulted
by
the
young
man
who
had
crept
into
her
room
and
that
mcgregor
had
come
roaring
down
the
hall
to
snatch
him
away
and
fling
him
outside
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hallway
near
the
stairway
leading
to
the
street
lived
a
barber
he
had
deserted
a
wife
and
four
children
in
a
town
in
ohio
and
to
prevent
recognition
had
grown
a
black
beard
between
this
man
and
mcgregor
a
companionship
had
sprung
up
and
they
went
together
on
sunday
mornings
to
walk
in
the
park
the
black
bearded
man
called
himself
frank
turner
frank
turner
had
a
passion
through
the
evenings
and
on
sunday
afternoons
he
sat
in
his
room
making
violins
he
worked
with
a
knife
glue
pieces
of
glass
and
sand
paper
and
spent
his
earnings
for
ingredients
for
the
making
of
varnishes
when
he
got
hold
of
a
piece
of
wood
that
seemed
an
answer
to
his
prayers
he
took
it
to
room
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
talked
of
what
he
would
do
with
it
sometimes
he
brought
a
violin
and
sitting
in
the
open
window
tested
the
quality
of
its
tone
one
evening
he
took
an
hour
of
mcgregor
time
to
talk
of
the
varnish
of
cremona
and
to
read
to
him
from
a
worn
little
book
concerning
the
old
italian
masters
of
violin
making
on
a
bench
in
the
park
sat
turner
the
maker
of
violins
the
man
who
dreamed
of
the
rediscovery
of
the
varnish
of
cremona
talking
to
mcgregor
son
of
the
pennsylvania
miner
it
was
a
sunday
afternoon
and
the
park
was
vibrant
with
life
all
day
the
street
cars
had
been
unloading
chicagoans
at
the
park
entrance
they
came
in
pairs
and
in
parties
young
men
with
their
sweethearts
and
fathers
with
families
at
their
heels
now
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
continued
to
come
a
steady
stream
of
humanity
flowing
along
the
gravel
walk
past
the
bench
where
the
two
men
sat
in
talk
through
the
stream
and
crossing
it
went
another
stream
homeward
bound
babies
cried
fathers
called
to
the
children
at
play
on
the
grass
cars
coming
to
the
park
filled
went
away
filled
mcgregor
looked
about
him
and
thought
of
himself
and
of
the
restless
moving
people
in
him
there
was
none
of
that
vague
fear
of
the
multitude
common
to
many
solitary
souls
his
contempt
of
men
and
of
the
lives
lived
by
men
reinforced
his
native
boldness
the
odd
little
rounding
of
the
shoulders
of
even
the
athletic
young
men
made
him
straighten
with
pride
his
own
shoulders
and
fat
and
lean
tall
and
short
he
thought
of
all
men
as
counters
in
some
vast
games
at
which
he
was
presently
to
be
a
master
player
the
passion
for
form
that
strange
intuitive
power
that
many
men
have
felt
and
none
but
the
masters
of
human
life
have
understood
had
begun
to
awaken
in
him
already
he
had
begun
to
sense
out
the
fact
that
for
him
law
was
but
an
incident
in
some
vast
design
and
he
was
altogether
untouched
by
the
desire
for
getting
on
in
the
world
by
the
greedy
little
snatching
at
trifles
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
the
lives
of
so
many
of
the
people
about
him
when
somewhere
in
the
park
a
band
began
to
play
he
nodded
his
head
up
and
down
and
ran
his
hand
nervously
up
and
down
the
legs
of
his
trousers
into
his
mind
came
the
desire
to
boast
to
the
barber
telling
of
the
things
he
meant
to
do
in
the
world
but
he
put
the
desire
away
instead
he
sat
silently
blinking
his
eyes
and
wondering
at
the
persistent
air
of
ineffectiveness
in
the
people
who
passed
when
a
band
went
by
playing
march
music
and
followed
by
some
fifty
men
wearing
white
plumes
in
their
hats
and
walking
with
awkwardness
he
was
startled
among
the
people
he
thought
there
was
a
change
something
like
a
running
shadow
passed
over
them
the
babbling
of
voices
ceased
and
like
himself
the
people
began
to
nod
their
heads
a
thought
gigantic
in
its
simplicity
began
to
come
into
his
mind
but
was
wiped
out
immediately
by
his
impatience
with
the
marchers
a
madness
to
spring
up
and
run
among
them
knocking
them
about
and
making
them
march
with
the
power
that
comes
of
abandonment
almost
lifted
him
from
the
bench
his
mouth
twitched
and
his
fingers
ached
for
action
in
and
out
among
the
trees
and
on
the
green
spaces
moved
the
people
along
the
shores
of
a
pond
sat
men
and
women
eating
the
evening
meal
from
baskets
or
from
white
cloths
spread
on
the
grass
they
laughed
and
shouted
at
each
other
and
at
the
children
calling
them
back
from
the
gravel
driveways
filled
with
moving
carriages
beaut
saw
a
girl
throw
an
egg
shell
and
hit
a
young
fellow
between
the
eyes
and
then
run
laughing
away
along
the
shore
of
the
pond
under
a
tree
a
woman
nursed
a
babe
covering
her
breasts
with
a
shawl
so
that
just
the
black
head
of
the
babe
showed
its
tiny
hand
clutched
at
the
mouth
of
the
woman
in
an
open
space
in
the
shadow
of
a
building
young
men
played
baseball
the
shouts
of
the
spectators
rising
above
the
murmur
of
the
voices
of
people
on
the
gravel
walk
a
thought
came
into
mcgregor
mind
that
he
wanted
to
discuss
with
the
older
man
he
was
moved
by
the
sight
of
women
about
and
shook
himself
like
one
awakening
from
a
dream
then
he
began
looking
at
the
ground
and
kicking
up
the
gravel
with
his
foot
look
here
he
said
turning
to
the
barber
what
is
a
man
to
do
about
women
about
getting
what
he
wants
from
the
women
the
barber
seemed
to
understand
it
has
come
to
that
then
he
asked
and
looked
quickly
up
he
lighted
a
pipe
and
sat
looking
at
the
people
it
was
then
he
told
mcgregor
of
the
wife
and
four
children
in
the
ohio
town
describing
the
little
brick
house
and
the
garden
and
the
coop
for
chickens
at
the
back
like
one
who
lingers
over
a
place
dear
to
his
fancy
something
old
and
weary
was
in
his
voice
as
he
finished
it
was
a
matter
for
me
to
decide
he
said
i
came
away
because
i
could
do
anything
else
i
not
excusing
myself
i
just
telling
you
there
was
something
messy
and
disorderly
about
it
all
about
my
life
with
her
and
with
them
i
could
stand
it
i
felt
myself
being
submerged
by
something
i
wanted
to
be
orderly
and
to
work
you
see
i
could
let
violin
making
alone
lord
how
i
tried
tried
bluffing
myself
about
it
calling
it
a
the
barber
looked
nervously
at
mcgregor
to
reassure
himself
of
his
interest
i
owned
a
shop
on
the
main
street
of
our
town
back
of
it
was
a
blacksmith
shop
during
the
day
i
stood
by
the
chair
in
my
shop
talking
to
men
being
shaved
about
the
love
of
women
and
a
man
duty
to
his
family
summer
afternoons
i
went
and
sat
on
a
keg
in
the
blacksmith
shop
and
talked
of
the
same
thing
with
the
smith
but
all
that
did
me
no
good
when
i
let
myself
go
i
dreamed
not
of
my
duty
to
my
family
but
of
working
undisturbed
as
i
do
now
here
in
the
city
in
my
room
in
the
evenings
and
on
a
sharpness
came
into
the
voice
of
the
speaker
he
turned
to
mcgregor
and
talked
vigorously
like
one
making
a
defence
my
woman
was
a
good
enough
sort
he
said
i
suppose
loving
is
an
art
like
writing
a
book
or
drawing
pictures
or
making
violins
people
try
to
do
it
and
succeed
in
the
end
we
threw
the
job
up
and
just
lived
together
like
most
people
do
our
lives
got
mussy
and
meaningless
that
how
it
was
before
she
married
me
my
wife
had
been
a
stenographer
in
a
factory
that
made
tin
cans
she
liked
that
work
she
could
make
her
fingers
dance
along
the
keys
when
she
read
a
book
at
home
she
did
think
the
writer
amounted
to
much
if
he
made
mistakes
about
punctuation
her
boss
was
so
proud
of
her
that
he
would
brag
of
her
work
to
visitors
and
sometimes
would
go
off
fishing
leaving
the
running
of
the
business
in
her
hands
i
do
know
why
she
married
me
she
was
happier
there
and
she
is
happier
back
there
now
we
got
to
walking
together
on
sunday
evenings
and
standing
under
the
trees
on
side
streets
kissing
and
looking
at
each
other
we
talked
about
a
lot
of
things
we
seemed
to
need
each
other
then
we
got
married
and
started
living
together
it
did
work
out
after
we
had
been
married
a
few
years
things
changed
i
do
know
why
i
thought
i
was
the
same
as
i
had
been
and
i
think
she
was
we
used
to
sit
around
quarrelling
about
it
each
blaming
the
other
anyway
we
did
get
along
we
would
sit
on
the
little
front
porch
of
our
house
in
the
evening
she
bragging
of
the
work
she
had
done
in
the
can
factory
and
i
dreaming
of
quietude
and
a
chance
to
work
on
the
violins
i
thought
i
knew
a
way
to
increase
the
quality
and
beauty
of
tone
and
i
had
that
idea
about
varnish
i
have
talked
to
you
about
i
even
dreamed
of
doing
things
those
old
fellows
of
cremona
did
do
when
she
had
been
talking
of
her
work
in
the
office
for
maybe
a
half
hour
she
would
look
up
and
find
that
i
had
been
listening
we
would
quarrel
we
even
quarrelled
before
the
children
after
they
came
once
she
said
that
she
did
see
how
it
would
matter
if
no
violins
had
ever
been
made
and
that
night
i
dreamed
of
choking
her
in
bed
i
woke
up
and
lay
there
beside
her
thinking
of
it
with
something
like
real
satisfaction
in
just
the
thought
that
one
long
hard
grip
of
my
fingers
would
get
her
out
of
my
way
for
good
we
did
always
feel
that
way
every
little
while
a
change
would
come
over
both
of
us
and
we
would
begin
to
take
an
interest
in
each
other
i
would
be
proud
of
the
work
she
had
done
in
the
factory
and
would
brag
of
it
to
men
coming
into
the
shop
in
the
evening
she
would
be
sympathetic
about
the
violins
and
put
the
baby
to
bed
to
let
me
alone
at
my
work
in
the
kitchen
then
we
would
begin
to
sit
in
the
darkness
in
the
house
and
hold
each
other
hands
we
would
forgive
things
that
had
been
said
and
play
a
sort
of
game
chasing
each
other
about
the
room
in
the
darkness
and
knocking
against
the
chairs
and
laughing
then
we
would
begin
to
look
at
each
other
and
kiss
presently
there
would
be
another
the
barber
threw
up
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
his
voice
lost
its
softer
reminiscent
quality
such
times
did
last
he
said
on
the
whole
it
was
no
life
to
live
i
came
away
the
children
are
in
a
state
institution
and
she
has
gone
back
to
her
work
in
the
office
the
town
hates
me
they
have
made
a
heroine
of
her
i
here
talking
to
you
with
these
whiskers
on
my
face
so
that
people
from
my
town
know
me
if
they
came
along
i
a
barber
and
i
would
shave
them
off
fast
enough
if
it
was
for
a
woman
walking
past
looked
back
at
mcgregor
in
her
eyes
lurked
an
invitation
it
reminded
him
of
something
in
the
eyes
of
the
pale
daughter
of
the
undertaker
of
coal
creek
an
uneasy
tremor
ran
through
him
what
do
you
do
about
women
now
he
asked
the
voice
of
the
smaller
man
arose
harsh
and
excited
in
the
evening
air
i
get
the
feeling
taken
out
of
me
as
a
man
would
have
a
tooth
fixed
he
said
i
pay
money
for
the
service
and
keep
my
mind
on
what
i
want
to
do
there
are
plenty
of
women
for
that
women
who
are
good
for
that
only
when
i
first
came
here
i
used
to
wander
about
at
night
wanting
to
go
to
my
room
and
work
but
with
my
mind
and
my
will
paralysed
by
that
feeling
i
do
do
that
now
and
i
wo
again
what
i
do
many
men
do
good
men
men
who
do
good
work
what
the
use
thinking
about
it
when
you
only
run
against
a
stone
wall
and
get
hurt
the
black
bearded
man
arose
thrust
his
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
looked
about
him
then
he
sat
down
again
he
seemed
to
be
filled
with
suppressed
excitement
there
is
a
big
hidden
something
going
on
in
modern
life
he
said
talking
rapidly
and
excitedly
it
used
to
touch
only
the
men
higher
up
now
it
reaches
down
to
men
like
me
barbers
and
workingmen
men
know
about
it
but
do
talk
and
do
dare
think
their
women
have
changed
women
used
to
be
willing
to
do
anything
for
men
just
be
slaves
to
them
the
best
men
do
ask
that
now
and
do
want
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
stood
over
mcgregor
men
do
understand
what
going
on
and
do
care
he
said
they
are
too
busy
getting
things
done
or
going
to
ball
games
or
quarrelling
about
politics
and
what
do
they
know
about
it
if
they
are
fools
enough
to
think
they
get
thrown
into
false
notions
they
see
about
them
a
lot
of
fine
purposeful
women
maybe
caring
for
their
children
and
they
blame
themselves
for
their
vices
and
are
ashamed
then
they
turn
to
the
other
women
anyway
shutting
their
eyes
and
going
ahead
they
pay
for
what
they
want
as
they
would
pay
for
a
dinner
thinking
no
more
of
the
women
who
serve
them
than
they
do
of
the
waitresses
who
serve
them
in
the
restaurants
they
refuse
to
think
of
the
new
kind
of
woman
that
is
growing
up
they
know
that
if
they
get
sentimental
about
her
get
into
trouble
or
get
new
tests
put
to
them
be
disturbed
you
see
and
spoil
their
work
or
their
peace
of
mind
they
do
want
to
get
into
trouble
or
be
disturbed
they
want
to
get
a
better
job
or
enjoy
a
ball
game
or
build
a
bridge
or
write
a
book
they
think
that
a
man
who
gets
sentimental
about
any
woman
is
a
fool
and
of
course
he
do
you
mean
that
all
of
them
do
that
asked
mcgregor
he
was
upset
by
what
had
been
said
it
struck
him
as
being
true
for
himself
he
was
afraid
of
women
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
road
was
being
built
by
his
companion
along
which
he
might
travel
with
safety
he
wanted
the
man
to
go
on
talking
into
his
brain
flashed
the
thought
that
if
he
had
the
thing
to
do
over
there
would
have
been
a
different
ending
to
the
afternoon
spent
with
the
pale
girl
on
the
hillside
the
barber
sat
down
upon
the
bench
the
flush
out
of
his
cheeks
well
i
have
done
pretty
well
myself
he
said
but
then
you
know
i
make
violins
and
do
think
of
women
i
been
in
chicago
two
years
and
i
spent
just
eleven
dollars
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
average
man
spends
i
wish
some
fellow
would
get
the
facts
and
publish
them
it
would
make
people
sit
up
there
must
be
millions
spent
here
every
you
see
i
not
very
strong
and
i
stand
all
day
on
my
feet
in
the
barber
he
looked
at
mcgregor
and
laughed
the
girl
in
the
hall
is
after
you
he
said
you
better
look
out
you
let
her
alone
stick
to
your
law
books
you
are
not
like
me
you
are
big
and
red
and
strong
eleven
dollars
wo
pay
your
way
here
in
chicago
for
no
two
mcgregor
looked
again
at
the
people
moving
toward
the
park
entrance
in
the
gathering
darkness
he
thought
it
wonderful
that
a
brain
could
think
a
thing
out
so
clearly
and
words
express
thoughts
so
lucidly
his
eagerness
to
follow
the
passing
girls
with
his
eyes
was
gone
he
was
interested
in
the
older
man
viewpoint
and
what
about
children
he
asked
the
older
man
sat
sideways
on
the
bench
there
was
a
troubled
look
in
his
eyes
and
a
suppressed
eager
quality
in
his
voice
i
going
to
tell
you
about
that
he
said
i
do
want
to
keep
anything
back
look
here
he
demanded
sliding
along
the
bench
toward
mcgregor
and
emphasising
his
points
by
slapping
one
hand
down
upon
the
other
all
children
my
children
he
paused
trying
to
gather
his
scattered
thoughts
into
words
when
mcgregor
started
to
speak
he
put
his
hand
up
as
though
to
ward
off
a
new
thought
or
another
question
i
not
trying
to
dodge
he
said
i
trying
to
get
thoughts
that
have
been
in
my
head
day
after
day
in
shape
to
tell
i
have
tried
to
express
them
before
i
know
men
and
women
cling
to
their
children
it
the
only
thing
they
have
left
of
the
dream
they
had
before
they
married
i
felt
that
way
it
held
me
for
a
long
time
it
would
be
holding
me
now
only
that
the
violins
pulled
so
hard
at
he
threw
up
his
hand
impatiently
you
see
i
had
to
find
an
answer
i
could
think
of
being
a
skunk
running
away
and
i
could
stay
i
was
intended
to
stay
some
men
are
intended
to
work
and
take
care
of
children
and
serve
women
perhaps
but
others
have
to
keep
trying
for
a
vague
something
all
their
lives
like
me
trying
for
a
tone
on
a
violin
if
they
do
get
it
it
does
matter
they
have
to
keep
trying
my
wife
used
to
say
i
get
tired
of
it
no
woman
ever
really
understands
a
man
caring
for
anything
except
herself
i
knocked
that
out
of
the
little
man
looked
up
at
mcgregor
do
you
think
i
a
skunk
he
asked
mcgregor
looked
at
him
gravely
i
do
know
he
said
go
on
and
tell
me
about
the
i
said
they
were
the
last
things
to
cling
to
they
are
we
used
to
have
religion
but
that
pretty
well
gone
now
the
old
kind
now
men
think
about
children
i
mean
a
certain
kind
of
men
the
ones
that
have
work
they
want
to
get
on
with
children
and
work
are
the
only
things
that
kind
care
about
if
they
have
a
sentiment
about
women
it
only
about
their
own
the
one
they
have
in
the
house
with
them
they
want
to
keep
that
one
finer
than
they
are
themselves
so
they
work
the
other
feeling
out
on
the
paid
women
women
fuss
about
men
loving
children
much
they
care
it
only
a
plan
for
demanding
adulation
for
themselves
that
they
do
earn
once
when
i
first
came
to
the
city
i
took
a
place
as
servant
in
a
wealthy
family
i
wanted
to
stay
under
cover
until
my
beard
grew
women
used
to
come
there
to
receptions
and
to
meetings
in
the
afternoon
to
talk
about
reforms
they
were
interested
in
bah
they
work
and
scheme
trying
to
get
at
men
they
are
at
it
all
their
lives
flattering
diverting
us
giving
us
false
ideas
pretending
to
be
weak
and
uncertain
when
they
are
strong
and
determined
they
have
no
mercy
they
wage
war
on
us
trying
to
make
us
slaves
they
want
to
take
us
captive
home
to
their
houses
as
caesar
took
captives
home
to
rome
you
look
here
he
jumped
to
his
feet
again
and
shook
his
fingers
at
mcgregor
you
just
try
something
you
try
being
open
and
frank
and
square
with
a
woman
any
woman
as
you
would
with
a
man
let
her
live
her
own
life
and
ask
her
to
let
you
live
yours
you
try
it
she
wo
she
will
die
he
sat
down
again
upon
the
bench
and
shook
his
head
back
and
forth
lord
how
i
wish
i
could
talk
he
said
i
making
a
muddle
of
this
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
oh
how
i
wanted
to
tell
you
it
part
of
my
idea
that
a
man
should
tell
a
boy
all
he
knows
we
got
to
quit
lying
to
mcgregor
looked
at
the
ground
he
was
profoundly
and
deeply
moved
and
interested
as
he
had
never
before
been
moved
by
anything
but
hate
two
women
coming
along
the
gravel
walk
stopped
under
a
tree
and
looked
back
the
barber
smiled
and
raised
his
hat
when
they
smiled
back
at
him
he
rose
and
started
toward
them
come
on
boy
he
whispered
behind
his
hand
to
mcgregor
let
get
when
mcgregor
looked
up
the
scene
before
his
eyes
infuriated
him
the
smiling
barber
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
the
two
women
waiting
under
the
tree
the
look
of
innocence
on
the
faces
of
all
of
them
stirred
a
blind
fury
in
his
brain
he
sprang
forward
clutching
the
shoulder
of
turner
with
his
hand
whirling
him
about
he
threw
him
to
his
hands
and
knees
get
out
of
here
you
females
he
roared
at
the
women
who
ran
off
in
terror
down
the
walk
the
barber
sat
again
upon
the
bench
beside
mcgregor
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
to
brush
the
bits
of
gravel
out
of
the
flesh
what
got
wrong
with
you
he
asked
mcgregor
hesitated
he
wondered
how
he
should
tell
what
was
in
his
mind
everything
in
its
place
he
said
finally
i
wanted
to
go
on
with
our
lights
flashed
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
park
the
two
men
sat
on
the
bench
thinking
each
his
own
thoughts
i
want
to
take
some
work
out
of
the
clamps
the
barber
said
looking
at
his
watch
together
the
two
men
walked
along
the
street
look
here
said
mcgregor
i
did
mean
to
hurt
you
those
two
women
that
came
up
and
interfered
with
what
we
were
working
out
made
me
women
always
interfere
said
the
barber
they
raise
hell
with
his
mind
ran
out
and
began
to
play
with
the
problem
of
the
sexes
if
a
lot
of
women
fall
in
the
fight
with
us
men
and
become
our
slaves
serving
us
as
the
paid
women
do
need
they
fuss
about
it
let
them
be
game
and
try
to
help
work
it
out
as
men
have
been
game
and
have
worked
and
thought
through
ages
of
perplexity
and
the
barber
stopped
on
the
street
corner
to
fill
and
light
his
pipe
women
can
change
everything
when
they
want
to
he
said
looking
at
mcgregor
and
letting
the
match
burn
out
in
his
fingers
they
can
have
motherhood
pensions
and
room
to
work
out
their
own
problem
in
the
world
or
anything
else
that
they
really
want
they
can
stand
up
face
to
face
with
men
they
do
want
to
they
want
to
enslave
us
with
their
faces
and
their
bodies
they
want
to
carry
on
the
old
old
weary
he
tapped
mcgregor
on
the
arm
if
a
few
of
us
wanting
with
all
our
might
to
get
something
done
beat
them
at
their
own
game
do
we
deserve
the
victory
he
asked
but
sometimes
i
think
i
would
like
a
woman
to
live
with
you
know
just
to
sit
and
talk
with
me
said
mcgregor
the
barber
laughed
puffing
at
his
pipe
he
walked
down
the
street
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
he
said
i
would
any
man
would
i
like
to
sit
in
the
room
for
a
spell
in
the
evening
talking
to
you
but
i
would
hate
to
give
up
violin
making
and
be
bound
all
my
life
to
serve
you
and
your
purposes
just
the
in
the
hallway
of
their
own
house
the
barber
spoke
to
mcgregor
as
he
looked
down
the
hallway
to
where
the
door
of
the
black
eyed
girl
room
had
just
crept
open
you
let
women
alone
he
said
when
you
feel
you
ca
stay
away
from
them
any
longer
you
come
and
talk
it
over
with
mcgregor
nodded
and
went
along
the
hallway
to
his
own
room
in
the
darkness
he
stood
by
the
window
and
looked
down
into
the
court
the
feeling
of
hidden
power
the
ability
to
rise
above
the
mess
into
which
modern
life
had
sunk
that
had
come
to
him
in
the
park
returned
and
he
walked
nervously
about
when
finally
he
sat
down
upon
a
chair
and
leaning
forward
put
his
head
in
his
hands
he
felt
like
one
who
has
started
on
a
long
journey
through
a
strange
and
dangerous
country
and
who
has
unexpectedly
come
upon
a
friend
going
the
same
way
chapter
iv
the
people
of
chicago
go
home
from
their
work
at
evening
drifting
they
go
in
droves
hurrying
along
it
is
a
startling
thing
to
look
closely
at
them
the
people
have
bad
mouths
their
mouths
are
slack
and
the
jaws
do
not
hang
right
the
mouths
are
like
the
shoes
they
wear
the
shoes
have
become
run
down
at
the
corners
from
too
much
pounding
on
the
hard
pavements
and
the
mouths
have
become
crooked
from
too
much
weariness
of
soul
something
is
wrong
with
modern
american
life
and
we
americans
do
not
want
to
look
at
it
we
much
prefer
to
call
ourselves
a
great
people
and
let
it
go
at
that
it
is
evening
and
the
people
of
chicago
go
home
from
work
clatter
clatter
clatter
go
the
heels
on
the
hard
pavements
jaws
wag
the
wind
blows
and
dirt
drifts
and
sifts
through
the
masses
of
the
people
every
one
has
dirty
ears
the
stench
in
the
street
cars
is
horrible
the
antiquated
bridges
over
the
rivers
are
packed
with
people
the
suburban
trains
going
away
south
and
west
are
cheaply
constructed
and
dangerous
a
people
calling
itself
great
and
living
in
a
city
also
called
great
go
to
their
houses
a
mere
disorderly
mass
of
humans
cheaply
equipped
everything
is
cheap
when
the
people
get
home
to
their
houses
they
sit
on
cheap
chairs
before
cheap
tables
and
eat
cheap
food
they
have
given
their
lives
for
cheap
things
the
poorest
peasant
of
one
of
the
old
countries
is
surrounded
by
more
beauty
his
very
equipment
for
living
has
more
solidity
the
modern
man
is
satisfied
with
what
is
cheap
and
unlovely
because
he
expects
to
rise
in
the
world
he
has
given
his
life
to
that
dreary
dream
and
he
is
teaching
his
children
to
follow
the
same
dream
mcgregor
was
touched
by
it
being
confused
by
the
matter
of
sex
he
had
listened
to
the
advice
of
the
barber
and
meant
to
settle
things
in
the
cheap
way
one
evening
a
month
after
the
talk
in
the
park
he
hurried
along
lake
street
on
the
west
side
with
that
end
in
view
it
was
near
eight
and
growing
dark
and
mcgregor
should
have
been
at
the
night
school
instead
he
walked
along
the
street
looking
at
the
frame
houses
a
fever
burned
in
his
blood
an
impulse
for
the
moment
stronger
than
the
impulse
that
kept
him
at
work
over
books
night
after
night
there
in
the
big
disorderly
city
and
as
yet
stronger
than
any
new
impulse
toward
a
vigorous
compelling
march
through
life
had
hold
of
him
his
eyes
stared
into
the
windows
he
hurried
along
filled
with
a
lust
that
stultified
his
brain
and
will
a
woman
sitting
at
the
window
of
a
little
frame
house
smiled
and
beckoned
to
him
mcgregor
walked
along
the
path
leading
to
the
little
frame
house
the
path
ran
through
a
squalid
yard
it
was
a
foul
place
like
the
court
under
his
window
behind
the
house
in
wycliff
place
here
also
discoloured
papers
worried
by
the
wind
ran
about
in
crazy
circles
mcgregor
heart
pounded
and
his
mouth
felt
dry
and
unpleasant
he
wondered
what
he
should
say
and
how
he
should
say
it
when
he
came
into
the
presence
of
the
woman
he
wished
there
were
some
one
to
be
hit
with
his
fist
he
did
want
to
make
love
he
wanted
relief
he
would
have
much
preferred
a
fight
the
veins
in
mcgregor
neck
began
to
swell
and
as
he
stood
in
the
darkness
before
the
door
of
the
house
he
swore
he
stared
up
and
down
the
street
but
the
sky
the
sight
of
which
might
have
helped
him
was
hidden
from
view
by
the
structure
of
an
elevated
railroad
pushing
open
the
door
of
the
house
he
stepped
in
in
the
dim
light
he
could
see
nothing
but
a
form
sprang
out
of
the
darkness
and
a
pair
of
powerful
arms
pinned
his
hands
to
his
sides
mcgregor
looked
quickly
about
a
man
huge
as
himself
held
him
tightly
against
the
door
he
had
one
glass
eye
and
a
stubby
black
beard
and
in
the
half
light
looked
sinister
and
dangerous
the
hand
of
the
woman
who
had
beckoned
to
him
from
the
window
fumbled
in
mcgregor
pockets
and
came
out
clutching
a
little
roll
of
money
her
face
set
now
and
ugly
like
the
man
looked
up
at
him
from
under
the
arms
of
her
ally
in
a
moment
mcgregor
heart
stopped
pounding
and
the
dry
unpleasant
taste
went
out
of
his
mouth
he
felt
relieved
and
glad
at
this
sudden
turn
to
the
affair
with
a
quick
upward
snap
of
his
knees
into
the
stomach
of
the
man
who
had
held
him
mcgregor
freed
himself
a
swinging
blow
to
the
neck
sent
his
assailant
groaning
to
the
floor
mcgregor
sprang
across
the
room
in
the
corner
by
the
bed
he
caught
the
woman
clutching
her
by
the
hair
he
whirled
her
about
hand
over
that
money
he
said
fiercely
the
woman
put
up
her
hands
and
plead
with
him
the
grip
of
his
hands
in
her
hair
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
she
thrust
the
roll
of
bills
into
his
hands
and
waited
trembling
thinking
he
intended
to
kill
her
a
new
feeling
swept
over
mcgregor
the
thought
of
having
come
into
the
house
at
the
invitation
of
this
woman
was
revolting
to
him
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
such
a
beast
as
he
stood
in
the
dim
light
thinking
of
this
and
looking
at
the
woman
he
became
lost
in
thought
and
wondered
why
the
idea
given
him
by
the
barber
that
had
seemed
so
clear
and
sensible
now
seemed
so
foolish
his
eyes
stared
at
the
woman
as
his
mind
returned
to
the
barber
talking
on
the
park
bench
and
he
was
seized
with
a
blind
fury
a
fury
not
directed
at
the
people
in
the
foul
little
room
but
at
himself
and
his
own
blindness
again
a
great
hatred
of
the
disorder
of
life
took
hold
of
him
and
as
though
all
of
the
disorderly
people
of
the
world
were
personified
in
her
he
swore
and
shook
the
woman
as
a
dog
might
have
shaken
a
foul
rag
sneak
dodger
mussy
fool
he
muttered
thinking
of
himself
as
a
giant
attacked
by
some
nauseous
beast
the
woman
screamed
with
terror
seeing
the
look
on
her
assailant
face
and
mistaking
the
meaning
of
his
words
she
trembled
and
thought
again
of
death
reaching
under
the
pillow
on
the
bed
she
got
another
roll
of
bills
and
thrust
that
also
into
mcgregor
hands
please
go
she
plead
we
were
mistaken
we
thought
you
were
some
one
mcgregor
strode
to
the
door
past
the
man
on
the
floor
who
groaned
and
rolled
about
he
walked
around
the
corner
to
madison
street
and
boarded
a
car
for
the
night
school
sitting
in
the
car
he
counted
the
money
in
the
roll
thrust
into
his
hand
by
the
kneeling
woman
and
laughed
so
that
the
people
in
the
car
looked
at
him
in
amazement
turner
has
spent
eleven
dollars
among
them
in
two
years
and
i
have
got
dollars
in
one
night
he
thought
he
jumped
off
the
car
and
walked
along
under
the
street
lights
striving
to
think
things
out
i
depend
on
any
one
he
muttered
i
have
to
make
my
own
way
the
barber
is
as
confused
as
the
rest
of
them
and
he
does
know
it
there
is
a
way
out
of
the
confusion
and
i
going
to
find
it
but
i
have
to
do
it
alone
i
ca
take
any
one
word
for
chapter
v
the
matter
of
mcgregor
attitude
toward
women
and
the
call
of
sex
was
not
of
course
settled
by
the
fight
in
the
house
in
lake
street
he
was
a
man
who
even
in
the
days
of
his
great
crudeness
appealed
strongly
to
the
mating
instinct
in
women
and
more
than
once
his
purpose
was
to
be
shaken
and
his
mind
disturbed
by
the
forms
the
faces
and
the
eyes
of
women
mcgregor
thought
he
had
settled
the
matter
he
forgot
the
girl
in
the
hallway
and
thought
only
of
advancement
in
the
warehouse
and
of
study
in
his
room
at
night
now
and
then
he
took
an
evening
off
and
went
for
a
walk
through
the
streets
or
in
one
of
the
parks
in
the
streets
of
chicago
under
the
night
lights
among
the
restless
moving
people
he
was
a
figure
to
be
remembered
sometimes
he
did
not
see
the
people
at
all
but
went
swinging
along
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
he
had
walked
in
the
pennsylvania
hills
he
was
striving
to
get
a
hold
of
some
elusive
quality
in
life
that
seemed
to
be
forever
out
of
reach
he
did
not
want
to
be
a
lawyer
or
a
warehouseman
what
did
he
want
along
the
street
he
went
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
and
because
his
was
not
a
gentle
nature
his
perplexity
drove
him
to
anger
and
he
swore
up
and
down
madison
street
he
went
striding
along
his
lips
muttering
words
in
a
corner
saloon
some
one
played
a
piano
groups
of
girls
passed
laughing
and
talking
he
came
to
the
bridge
that
led
over
the
river
into
the
loop
district
and
then
turned
restlessly
back
on
the
sidewalks
along
canal
street
he
saw
men
loitering
before
cheap
lodging
houses
their
clothing
was
filthy
with
long
wear
and
there
was
no
light
of
determination
in
their
faces
in
the
little
fine
interstices
of
the
cloth
of
which
their
clothes
were
made
was
gathered
the
filth
of
the
city
in
which
they
lived
and
in
the
stuff
of
their
natures
the
filth
and
disorder
of
modern
civilisation
had
also
found
lodging
on
walked
mcgregor
looking
at
things
and
the
flame
of
anger
within
burned
stronger
and
stronger
he
saw
the
drifting
clouds
of
people
of
all
nations
that
wander
at
night
in
halstead
street
and
turning
into
a
side
street
saw
also
the
italians
poles
and
russians
that
at
evening
gather
on
the
sidewalks
before
tenements
in
that
district
the
desire
in
mcgregor
for
some
kind
of
activity
became
a
madness
his
body
shook
with
the
strength
of
his
desire
to
end
the
vast
disorder
of
life
with
all
the
ardour
of
youth
he
wanted
to
see
if
with
the
strength
of
his
arm
he
could
shake
mankind
out
of
its
sloth
a
drunken
man
passed
and
following
him
came
a
large
man
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
the
large
man
did
not
walk
with
any
suggestion
of
power
in
his
legs
he
shambled
along
he
was
like
a
huge
child
with
fat
cheeks
and
great
untrained
body
a
child
without
muscles
and
hardness
clinging
to
the
skirts
of
life
mcgregor
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
the
big
ungainly
figure
the
man
seemed
to
personify
all
of
the
things
against
which
his
soul
was
in
revolt
and
he
stopped
and
stood
crouched
a
ferocious
light
burning
in
his
eyes
into
the
gutter
rolled
the
man
stunned
by
the
force
of
the
blow
dealt
him
by
the
miner
son
he
crawled
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
cried
for
help
his
pipe
had
rolled
away
into
the
darkness
mcgregor
stood
on
the
sidewalk
and
waited
a
crowd
of
men
standing
before
a
tenement
house
started
to
run
toward
him
again
he
crouched
he
prayed
that
they
would
come
on
and
let
him
fight
them
also
in
anticipation
of
a
great
struggle
joy
shone
in
his
eyes
and
his
muscles
twitched
and
then
the
man
in
the
gutter
got
to
his
feet
and
ran
away
the
men
who
had
started
to
run
toward
him
stopped
and
turned
back
mcgregor
walked
on
his
heart
heavy
with
the
sense
of
defeat
he
was
a
little
sorry
for
the
man
he
had
struck
and
who
had
made
so
ridiculous
a
figure
crawling
about
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
he
was
more
perplexed
than
ever
mcgregor
tried
again
to
solve
the
problem
of
women
he
had
been
much
pleased
by
the
outcome
of
the
affair
in
the
little
frame
house
and
the
next
day
bought
law
books
with
the
dollars
thrust
into
his
hand
by
the
frightened
woman
later
he
stood
in
his
room
stretching
his
great
body
like
a
lion
returned
from
the
kill
and
thought
of
the
little
barber
in
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
stooping
over
his
violin
his
mind
busy
with
the
attempt
to
justify
himself
because
he
would
not
face
one
of
life
problems
the
feeling
of
resentment
against
the
man
had
gone
he
thought
of
the
course
laid
out
for
himself
by
that
philosopher
and
laughed
there
is
something
about
it
to
avoid
like
giving
yourself
up
to
digging
in
the
dirt
under
the
ground
he
told
himself
mcgregor
second
adventure
began
on
a
saturday
night
and
again
he
let
himself
be
led
into
it
by
the
barber
the
night
was
hot
and
the
younger
man
sat
in
his
room
filled
with
a
desire
to
go
forth
and
explore
the
city
the
quiet
of
the
house
the
distant
rumble
of
street
cars
the
sound
of
a
band
playing
far
down
the
street
disturbed
and
diverted
his
mind
he
wished
that
he
might
take
a
stick
in
his
hands
and
go
forth
to
prowl
among
the
hills
as
he
had
gone
on
such
nights
in
his
youth
in
the
pennsylvania
town
the
door
to
his
room
opened
and
the
barber
came
in
in
his
hand
he
held
two
tickets
he
sat
on
the
window
sill
to
explain
there
is
a
dance
in
a
hall
on
monroe
street
said
the
barber
excitedly
i
have
two
tickets
here
a
politician
sold
them
to
the
boss
in
the
shop
where
i
the
barber
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
to
his
mind
there
was
something
delicious
in
the
thought
of
the
boss
barber
being
forced
by
the
politicians
to
buy
dance
tickets
they
cost
two
dollars
each
he
cried
and
shook
with
laughter
you
should
have
seen
my
boss
squirm
he
did
want
the
tickets
but
was
afraid
not
to
take
them
the
politician
could
make
trouble
for
him
and
he
knew
it
you
see
we
make
a
on
the
races
in
the
shop
and
that
is
against
the
law
the
politician
could
make
trouble
for
us
the
boss
paid
out
the
four
dollars
swearing
under
his
breath
and
when
the
politician
had
gone
out
he
threw
them
at
me
take
them
he
shouted
do
want
the
rotten
things
is
a
man
a
horse
trough
at
which
every
beast
can
stop
to
drink
mcgregor
and
the
barber
sat
in
the
room
laughing
at
the
boss
barber
who
had
smilingly
bought
the
tickets
while
consumed
with
inward
wrath
the
barber
urged
mcgregor
to
go
with
him
to
the
dance
we
will
make
a
night
of
it
he
said
we
will
see
women
there
two
that
i
know
they
live
upstairs
over
a
grocery
store
i
have
been
with
them
they
will
open
your
eyes
they
are
a
kind
of
women
you
have
known
bold
and
clever
and
good
fellows
mcgregor
got
up
and
pulled
his
shirt
over
his
head
a
wave
of
feverish
excitement
ran
over
his
body
we
shall
see
about
this
he
said
we
shall
see
if
this
is
another
wrong
trail
you
are
starting
me
on
you
go
to
your
room
and
get
ready
i
am
going
to
fix
myself
in
the
dance
hall
mcgregor
sat
on
a
seat
by
the
wall
with
one
of
the
two
women
lauded
by
the
barber
and
a
third
one
who
was
frail
and
bloodless
to
him
the
adventure
had
been
a
failure
the
swing
of
the
dance
music
struck
no
answering
chord
in
him
he
saw
the
couples
on
the
floor
clasped
in
each
other
arms
writhing
and
turning
swaying
back
and
forth
looking
into
each
other
eyes
and
turned
aside
wishing
himself
back
in
his
room
among
the
law
books
the
barber
talked
to
two
of
the
women
bantering
them
mcgregor
thought
the
conversation
inane
and
trivial
it
skirted
the
edge
of
things
and
ran
off
into
vague
references
to
other
times
and
adventures
of
which
he
knew
nothing
the
barber
danced
away
with
one
of
the
women
she
was
tall
and
the
head
of
the
barber
barely
passed
her
shoulder
his
black
beard
shone
against
her
white
dress
the
two
women
sat
beside
him
and
talked
mcgregor
gathered
that
the
frail
woman
was
a
maker
of
hats
something
about
her
attracted
him
and
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
looked
at
her
not
hearing
the
talk
a
youth
came
up
and
took
the
other
woman
away
from
across
the
hall
the
barber
beckoned
to
him
a
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
this
woman
beside
him
was
frail
and
thin
and
bloodless
like
the
women
of
coal
creek
a
feeling
of
intimacy
with
her
came
over
him
he
felt
as
he
had
felt
concerning
the
tall
pale
girl
of
coal
creek
when
they
together
gether
had
climbed
the
hill
to
the
eminence
that
looked
down
into
the
valley
of
farms
chapter
vi
edith
carson
the
milliner
whom
fate
had
thrown
into
the
company
of
mcgregor
was
a
frail
woman
of
and
lived
alone
in
two
rooms
at
the
back
of
her
millinery
store
her
life
was
almost
devoid
of
colour
on
sunday
morning
she
wrote
a
long
letter
to
her
family
on
an
indiana
farm
and
then
put
on
a
hat
from
among
the
samples
in
the
show
case
along
the
wall
and
went
to
church
sitting
by
herself
in
the
same
seat
sunday
after
sunday
and
afterward
remembering
nothing
of
the
sermon
on
sunday
afternoon
edith
went
by
to
a
park
and
walked
alone
under
the
trees
if
it
threatened
rain
she
sat
in
the
larger
of
the
two
rooms
back
of
the
shop
sewing
on
new
dresses
for
herself
or
for
a
sister
who
had
married
a
blacksmith
in
the
indiana
town
and
who
had
four
children
edith
had
soft
hair
and
grey
eyes
with
small
brown
spots
on
the
iris
she
was
so
slender
that
she
wore
pads
about
her
body
under
her
dress
to
fill
it
out
in
her
youth
she
had
had
a
sweetheart
a
fat
boy
who
lived
on
the
next
farm
once
they
had
gone
together
to
the
fair
at
the
county
seat
and
coming
home
in
the
buggy
at
night
he
had
put
his
arm
about
her
and
kissed
her
you
ai
very
big
he
had
said
edith
sent
to
a
mail
order
house
in
chicago
and
bought
the
padding
which
she
wore
under
her
dress
with
it
came
an
oil
which
she
rubbed
on
herself
the
label
on
the
bottle
spoke
of
the
contents
with
great
respect
as
a
wonderful
developer
the
heavy
pads
wore
raw
places
on
her
side
against
which
her
clothes
rubbed
but
she
bore
the
pain
with
grim
stoicism
remembering
what
the
fat
boy
had
said
after
edith
came
to
chicago
and
opened
a
shop
of
her
own
she
had
a
letter
from
her
former
admirer
it
pleases
me
to
think
that
the
same
wind
that
blows
over
me
blows
also
over
you
it
said
after
that
one
letter
she
did
not
hear
from
him
again
he
had
the
phrase
out
of
a
book
he
had
read
and
had
written
the
letter
to
edith
that
he
might
use
it
after
the
letter
had
gone
he
thought
of
her
frail
figure
and
repented
of
the
impulse
that
had
tricked
him
into
writing
half
in
alarm
he
began
courting
and
soon
married
another
girl
sometimes
on
her
rare
visits
home
edith
had
seen
her
former
lover
driving
along
the
road
the
sister
who
had
married
the
blacksmith
said
that
he
was
stingy
that
his
wife
had
nothing
to
wear
but
a
cheap
calico
dress
and
that
on
saturday
he
drove
off
to
town
alone
leaving
her
to
milk
the
cows
and
feed
the
pigs
and
horses
once
he
encountered
edith
on
the
road
and
tried
to
get
her
into
the
wagon
to
ride
with
him
although
she
had
walked
along
the
road
ignoring
him
she
took
the
letter
about
the
wind
that
blew
over
them
both
out
of
a
drawer
on
spring
evenings
or
after
a
walk
in
the
park
and
read
it
over
after
she
had
read
it
she
sat
in
the
darkness
at
the
front
of
the
store
looking
through
the
screen
door
at
people
in
the
street
and
wondered
what
life
would
mean
to
her
if
she
had
a
man
on
whom
she
could
bestow
her
love
in
her
heart
she
believed
that
unlike
the
wife
of
the
fat
youth
she
would
have
borne
children
in
chicago
edith
carson
had
made
money
she
had
a
genius
for
economy
in
the
management
of
her
business
in
six
years
she
had
cleared
a
large
debt
from
the
shop
and
had
a
comfortable
balance
in
the
bank
girls
who
worked
in
factories
or
in
stores
came
and
left
most
of
their
meagre
surplus
in
her
shop
and
other
girls
who
did
work
came
in
throwing
dollars
about
and
talking
about
gentlemen
edith
hated
the
bargaining
but
attended
to
it
with
shrewdness
and
with
a
quiet
disarming
little
smile
on
her
face
what
she
liked
was
to
sit
quietly
in
the
room
and
trim
hats
when
the
business
grew
she
had
a
woman
to
tend
the
shop
and
a
girl
to
sit
beside
her
and
help
with
the
hats
she
had
a
friend
the
wife
of
a
motorman
on
the
line
who
sometimes
came
to
see
her
in
the
evening
the
friend
was
a
plump
little
woman
dissatisfied
with
her
marriage
and
she
got
edith
to
make
her
several
new
hats
a
year
for
which
she
paid
nothing
edith
went
to
the
dance
at
which
she
met
mcgregor
with
the
wife
and
a
girl
who
lived
upstairs
over
a
bakery
next
door
to
the
shop
the
dance
was
held
in
a
hall
over
a
saloon
and
was
given
for
the
benefit
of
a
political
organisation
in
which
the
baker
was
a
leader
the
wife
of
the
baker
came
in
and
sold
edith
two
tickets
one
for
herself
and
one
for
the
wife
of
the
motorman
who
happened
to
be
sitting
with
her
at
the
time
that
evening
after
the
motorman
wife
had
gone
home
edith
decided
to
go
to
the
dance
and
the
decision
was
something
like
an
adventure
in
itself
the
night
was
hot
and
sultry
lightning
flashed
in
the
sky
and
clouds
of
dust
swept
down
the
street
edith
sat
in
the
darkness
behind
the
bolted
screen
door
and
looked
at
the
people
who
hurried
homeward
down
the
street
a
wave
of
revolt
at
the
narrowness
and
emptiness
of
her
life
ran
through
her
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
she
closed
the
shop
door
and
going
into
the
room
at
the
back
lighted
the
gas
and
stood
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
i
go
to
the
dance
she
thought
perhaps
i
shall
get
a
man
if
he
wo
marry
me
he
can
have
what
he
wants
of
me
in
the
dance
hall
edith
sat
demurely
by
the
wall
near
a
window
and
watched
the
couples
whirl
about
on
the
floor
through
an
open
door
she
could
see
couples
sitting
in
another
room
around
tables
and
drinking
beer
a
tall
young
man
in
white
trousers
and
white
slippers
went
about
on
the
dance
floor
he
smiled
and
bowed
to
the
women
once
he
started
across
the
floor
toward
edith
and
her
heart
beat
rapidly
but
just
when
she
thought
he
intended
to
speak
to
her
and
to
the
motorman
wife
he
turned
and
went
to
another
part
of
the
room
edith
followed
him
with
her
eyes
admiring
his
white
trousers
and
his
shining
white
teeth
the
wife
of
the
motorman
went
away
with
a
small
straight
man
with
a
grey
moustache
whom
edith
thought
had
unpleasant
eyes
and
two
girls
came
and
sat
beside
her
they
were
customers
of
her
store
and
lived
together
in
a
flat
over
a
grocery
on
monroe
street
edith
had
heard
the
girl
who
sat
in
the
workroom
with
her
speak
slightingly
of
them
the
three
sat
together
along
the
wall
and
talked
of
hats
and
then
across
the
floor
of
the
dance
hall
came
two
men
a
huge
fellow
and
a
little
man
with
a
black
beard
the
two
women
hailed
them
and
the
five
sat
together
making
a
party
by
the
wall
the
little
man
keeping
up
a
running
stream
of
comments
about
the
people
on
the
floor
with
edith
two
companions
a
dance
struck
up
and
taking
one
of
the
women
the
man
danced
away
edith
and
the
other
woman
again
talked
of
hats
the
huge
fellow
beside
her
said
nothing
but
followed
the
women
about
the
dance
hall
with
his
eyes
edith
thought
she
had
never
seen
so
homely
a
fellow
at
the
end
of
the
dance
the
man
went
through
the
door
into
the
room
filled
with
little
tables
and
made
a
sign
to
the
man
to
follow
a
boyish
looking
fellow
appeared
and
went
away
with
the
other
woman
and
edith
sat
alone
on
the
bench
by
the
wall
beside
mcgregor
this
place
does
interest
me
said
mcgregor
quickly
i
do
like
to
sit
watching
people
hop
about
on
their
toes
if
you
want
to
come
with
me
we
get
out
of
here
and
go
to
some
place
where
we
can
talk
and
get
the
little
milliner
walked
across
the
floor
on
the
arm
of
mcgregor
her
heart
jumping
with
excitement
i
got
a
man
she
thought
exulting
that
the
man
had
deliberately
chosen
her
she
knew
she
had
heard
the
introductions
and
the
bantering
talk
of
the
man
and
had
noted
the
indifference
of
the
big
man
to
the
other
women
edith
looked
at
her
companion
huge
frame
and
forgot
his
homeliness
into
her
mind
came
a
picture
of
the
fat
boy
grown
into
a
man
driving
down
the
road
in
the
wagon
and
leeringly
asking
her
to
ride
with
him
a
flood
of
anger
at
the
memory
of
the
look
of
greedy
assurance
in
his
eyes
came
over
her
this
one
could
knock
him
over
a
fence
she
thought
where
are
we
going
now
she
asked
mcgregor
looked
down
at
her
to
some
place
where
we
can
talk
he
said
i
was
sick
of
this
place
you
ought
to
know
where
we
going
going
with
you
you
are
going
with
mcgregor
wished
he
were
in
coal
creek
he
felt
he
would
like
to
take
this
woman
over
the
hill
and
sit
on
the
log
to
talk
of
his
father
as
they
walked
along
monroe
street
edith
thought
of
the
resolution
she
had
made
as
she
stood
before
the
mirror
in
her
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
on
the
evening
when
she
had
decided
to
come
to
the
dance
she
wondered
if
the
great
adventure
was
about
to
come
to
her
and
her
hand
trembled
on
mcgregor
arm
a
hot
wave
of
hope
and
fear
shot
through
her
at
the
door
of
the
millinery
shop
she
fumbled
with
uncertain
hands
as
she
unlocked
the
door
a
delicious
feeling
shook
her
she
felt
like
a
bride
glad
and
yet
ashamed
and
afraid
in
the
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
mcgregor
lighted
the
gas
and
pulling
off
his
overcoat
threw
it
on
the
couch
at
the
side
of
the
room
he
was
not
in
the
least
excited
and
with
a
steady
hand
lighted
the
fire
in
the
little
stove
and
then
looking
up
he
asked
edith
if
he
might
smoke
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
come
home
to
his
own
house
and
the
woman
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
to
unpin
her
hat
and
waited
hopefully
to
see
what
course
the
night
adventure
would
take
for
two
hours
mcgregor
sat
in
the
rocking
chair
in
edith
carson
room
and
talked
of
coal
creek
and
of
his
life
in
chicago
he
talked
freely
letting
himself
go
as
a
man
might
in
talking
to
one
of
his
own
people
after
a
long
absence
his
attitude
and
the
quiet
ring
in
his
voice
confused
and
puzzled
edith
she
had
expected
something
quite
different
going
to
the
little
room
at
the
side
she
brought
forth
a
teakettle
and
prepared
to
make
tea
the
big
man
still
sat
in
her
chair
smoking
and
talking
a
delightful
feeling
of
safety
and
coziness
crept
over
her
she
thought
her
room
beautiful
but
mingled
with
her
satisfaction
was
a
faint
grey
streak
of
fear
of
course
he
wo
come
back
again
she
thought
chapter
vii
in
the
year
following
the
beginning
of
his
acquaintanceship
with
edith
carson
mcgregor
continued
to
work
hard
and
steadily
in
the
warehouse
and
with
his
books
at
night
he
was
promoted
to
be
foreman
replacing
the
german
and
he
thought
he
had
made
progress
with
his
studies
when
he
did
not
go
to
the
night
school
he
went
to
edith
carson
place
and
sat
reading
a
book
and
smoking
his
pipe
by
a
little
table
in
the
back
room
about
the
room
and
in
and
out
of
her
shop
moved
edith
going
softly
and
quietly
a
light
began
to
come
into
her
eyes
and
colour
into
her
cheeks
she
did
not
talk
but
new
and
daring
thoughts
visited
her
mind
and
a
thrill
of
reawakened
life
ran
through
her
body
with
gentle
insistence
she
did
not
let
her
dreams
express
themselves
in
words
and
almost
hoped
that
she
might
be
able
to
go
on
forever
thus
having
this
strong
man
come
into
her
presence
and
sit
absorbed
in
his
own
affairs
within
the
walls
of
her
house
sometimes
she
wanted
him
to
talk
and
wished
that
she
had
the
power
to
lead
him
into
the
telling
of
little
facts
of
his
life
she
wanted
to
be
told
of
his
mother
and
father
of
his
boyhood
in
the
pennsylvania
town
of
his
dreams
and
his
desires
but
for
the
most
part
she
was
content
to
wait
and
only
hoped
that
nothing
would
happen
to
bring
an
end
to
her
waiting
mcgregor
began
to
read
books
of
history
and
became
absorbed
in
the
figures
of
certain
men
all
soldiers
and
leaders
of
soldiers
who
stalked
across
the
pages
wherein
was
written
the
story
of
man
life
the
figures
of
sherman
grant
lee
jackson
alexander
caesar
napoleon
and
wellington
seemed
to
him
to
stand
starkly
up
among
the
other
figures
in
the
books
and
going
to
the
public
library
at
the
noon
hour
he
got
books
concerning
these
men
and
for
a
time
lost
interest
in
the
study
of
law
and
devoted
himself
to
contemplation
of
the
breakers
of
laws
there
was
something
beautiful
about
mcgregor
in
those
days
he
was
as
virginal
and
pure
as
a
chunk
of
the
hard
black
coal
out
of
the
hills
of
his
own
state
and
like
the
coal
ready
to
burn
himself
out
into
power
nature
had
been
kind
to
him
he
had
the
gift
of
silence
and
of
isolation
all
about
him
were
other
men
perhaps
as
strong
physically
as
himself
and
with
better
trained
minds
who
were
being
destroyed
and
he
was
not
being
destroyed
for
the
others
life
let
itself
run
out
in
the
endless
doing
of
little
tasks
the
thinking
of
little
thoughts
and
the
saying
of
groups
of
words
over
and
over
endlessly
like
parrots
that
sit
in
cages
and
earn
their
bread
by
screaming
two
or
three
sentences
to
passers
by
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
speculate
on
how
man
has
been
defeated
by
his
ability
to
say
words
the
brown
bear
in
the
forest
has
no
such
power
and
the
lack
of
it
has
enabled
him
to
retain
a
kind
of
nobility
of
bearing
sadly
lacking
in
us
on
and
on
through
life
we
go
socialists
dreamers
makers
of
laws
sellers
of
goods
and
believers
in
suffrage
for
women
and
we
continuously
say
words
words
crooked
words
words
without
power
or
pregnancy
in
them
the
matter
is
one
to
be
thought
of
seriously
by
youths
and
maidens
inclined
to
garrulousness
those
who
have
the
habit
of
it
will
never
change
the
gods
who
lean
over
the
rim
of
the
world
to
laugh
at
us
have
marked
them
for
their
barrenness
and
yet
the
word
must
run
on
mcgregor
the
silent
wanted
his
word
he
wanted
his
true
note
as
an
individual
to
ring
out
above
the
hubbub
of
voices
and
then
he
wanted
to
use
the
strength
and
the
virility
within
himself
to
carry
his
word
far
what
he
did
not
want
was
that
his
mouth
become
foul
and
his
brain
become
numb
with
the
saying
of
the
words
and
the
thinking
of
the
thoughts
of
other
men
and
that
he
in
his
turn
become
a
mere
toiling
chattering
puppet
to
the
gods
for
a
long
time
the
miner
son
wondered
what
power
lay
in
the
men
whose
figures
stood
up
so
boldly
in
the
pages
of
the
books
he
read
he
tried
to
think
the
matter
out
as
he
sat
in
edith
room
or
walked
by
himself
through
the
streets
in
the
warehouse
he
looked
with
new
curiosity
at
the
men
who
worked
in
the
great
rooms
piling
and
unpiling
apple
barrels
and
the
boxes
of
eggs
and
fruit
when
he
came
into
one
of
the
rooms
the
men
who
had
been
standing
in
groups
idly
talking
of
their
own
affairs
began
to
run
busily
about
they
no
longer
chattered
but
as
long
as
he
remained
worked
desperately
furtively
watching
as
he
stood
staring
at
them
mcgregor
wondered
he
tried
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
the
power
that
made
them
willing
to
work
until
their
bodies
were
bent
and
stooped
that
made
them
unashamed
to
be
afraid
and
that
left
them
in
the
end
mere
slaves
to
words
and
formulas
the
perplexed
young
man
who
watched
the
men
in
the
warehouse
began
to
think
that
the
passion
for
reproduction
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
matter
perhaps
his
constant
association
with
edith
awakened
the
thought
his
own
loins
were
heavy
with
the
seeds
of
children
and
only
his
absorption
in
the
thought
of
finding
himself
kept
him
from
devoting
himself
to
the
feeding
of
his
lusts
one
day
he
had
a
talk
concerning
the
matter
with
a
at
the
warehouse
the
talk
came
about
in
this
way
in
the
warehouse
the
men
came
in
at
the
door
in
the
morning
drifting
in
like
flies
that
wander
in
at
the
open
windows
on
a
summer
day
with
downcast
eyes
they
shuffled
across
the
long
floor
white
with
lime
morning
after
morning
they
came
in
at
the
door
and
went
silently
to
their
places
looking
at
the
floor
and
scowling
a
slender
young
man
who
acted
as
shipping
clerk
during
the
day
sat
in
a
little
coop
and
to
him
the
men
as
they
passed
called
out
their
numbers
from
time
to
time
the
shipping
clerk
who
was
an
irishman
tried
to
joke
with
one
of
them
tapping
sharply
upon
his
desk
with
a
pencil
as
though
to
compel
attention
they
are
no
good
he
said
to
himself
when
in
response
to
his
sallies
they
only
smiled
vaguely
although
they
get
but
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
they
are
overpaid
like
mcgregor
he
had
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
men
whose
numbers
he
put
in
the
book
their
stupidity
he
took
as
a
compliment
to
himself
we
are
the
kind
who
get
things
done
he
thought
as
he
put
the
pencil
back
of
his
ear
and
closed
the
book
in
his
mind
the
futile
pride
of
the
middle
class
man
flamed
up
in
his
contempt
for
the
workers
he
forgot
also
to
have
contempt
for
himself
one
morning
mcgregor
and
the
shipping
clerk
stood
upon
a
board
platform
facing
the
street
and
the
shipping
clerk
talked
of
parentage
the
wives
of
the
workers
here
have
children
as
cattle
have
calves
said
the
irishman
moved
by
some
hidden
sentiment
within
himself
he
added
heartily
oh
well
what
a
man
for
it
nice
to
see
kids
around
the
house
i
got
four
kids
myself
you
should
see
them
play
about
in
the
garden
at
my
place
in
oak
park
when
i
come
home
in
the
mcgregor
thought
of
edith
carson
and
a
faint
hunger
began
to
grow
within
him
a
desire
that
was
later
to
come
near
to
upsetting
the
purpose
of
his
life
began
to
make
itself
felt
with
a
growl
he
fought
against
the
desire
and
confused
the
irishman
by
making
an
attack
upon
him
well
how
are
you
any
better
he
asked
bluntly
do
you
think
your
children
any
more
important
than
theirs
you
may
have
a
better
mind
but
their
bodies
are
better
and
your
mind
has
made
you
a
very
striking
figure
as
far
as
i
can
turning
away
from
the
irishman
who
had
begun
to
sputter
with
wrath
mcgregor
went
up
an
elevator
to
a
distant
part
of
the
building
to
think
of
the
irishman
words
from
time
to
time
he
spoke
sharply
to
a
workman
who
loitered
in
one
of
the
passages
between
the
piles
of
boxes
and
barrels
under
his
hand
the
work
in
the
warehouse
had
begun
to
take
on
order
and
the
little
superintendent
who
had
employed
him
rubbed
his
hands
with
delight
in
a
corner
by
a
window
stood
mcgregor
wondering
why
he
also
did
not
want
to
devote
his
life
to
being
the
father
of
children
in
the
dim
light
across
the
face
of
the
window
a
fat
old
spider
crawled
slowly
in
the
hideous
body
of
the
insect
there
was
something
that
suggested
to
the
mind
of
the
struggling
thinker
the
sloth
of
the
world
vaguely
his
mind
groped
about
trying
to
get
hold
of
words
and
ideas
to
express
what
was
in
his
brain
ugly
crawling
things
that
look
at
the
floor
he
muttered
if
they
have
children
it
is
without
order
or
orderly
purpose
it
is
an
accident
like
the
accident
of
the
fly
that
falls
into
the
net
built
by
the
insect
here
the
coming
of
the
children
is
like
the
coming
of
the
flies
it
feeds
a
kind
of
cowardice
in
men
in
the
children
men
hope
vainly
to
see
done
what
they
have
not
the
courage
to
try
to
with
an
oath
mcgregor
smashed
with
his
heavy
leather
glove
the
fat
thing
wandering
aimlessly
across
the
light
i
must
not
be
confused
by
little
things
there
is
still
going
on
the
attempt
to
force
me
into
the
hole
in
the
ground
there
is
a
hole
here
in
which
men
live
and
work
just
as
there
is
in
the
mining
town
from
which
i
hurrying
out
of
his
room
that
evening
mcgregor
went
to
see
edith
he
wanted
to
look
at
her
and
to
think
in
the
little
room
at
the
back
he
sat
for
an
hour
trying
to
read
a
book
and
then
for
the
first
time
shared
his
thoughts
with
her
i
am
trying
to
discover
why
men
are
of
so
little
importance
he
said
suddenly
are
they
mere
tools
for
women
tell
me
that
tell
me
what
women
think
and
what
they
want
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
turned
again
to
the
reading
of
the
book
oh
well
he
added
it
does
need
to
bother
me
i
wo
let
any
women
lead
me
into
being
a
reproductive
tool
for
edith
was
alarmed
she
took
mcgregor
outburst
as
a
declaration
of
war
against
herself
and
her
influence
and
her
hands
began
to
tremble
then
a
new
thought
came
to
her
he
needs
money
to
get
on
in
the
world
she
told
herself
and
a
little
thrill
of
joy
ran
through
her
as
she
thought
of
her
own
carefully
guarded
hoard
she
wondered
how
she
could
offer
it
to
him
so
that
there
would
be
no
danger
of
a
refusal
you
all
right
said
mcgregor
preparing
to
depart
you
do
not
interfere
with
a
man
edith
blushed
and
like
the
workmen
in
the
warehouse
looked
at
the
floor
something
in
his
words
startled
her
and
when
he
was
gone
she
went
to
her
desk
and
taking
out
her
bankbook
turned
its
pages
with
new
pleasure
without
hesitation
she
who
indulged
herself
in
nothing
would
have
given
all
to
mcgregor
and
out
into
the
street
went
the
man
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
he
dismissed
from
his
mind
the
thoughts
of
women
and
children
and
began
again
to
think
of
the
stirring
figures
of
history
that
had
made
so
strong
an
appeal
to
him
as
he
passed
over
one
of
the
bridges
he
stopped
and
stood
leaning
over
the
rail
to
look
at
the
black
water
below
why
has
thought
never
succeeded
in
replacing
action
he
asked
himself
why
are
the
men
who
write
books
in
some
way
less
full
of
meaning
than
the
men
who
do
things
mcgregor
was
staggered
by
the
thought
that
had
come
to
him
and
wondered
if
he
had
started
on
a
wrong
trail
by
coming
to
the
city
and
trying
to
educate
himself
for
an
hour
he
stood
in
the
darkness
and
tried
to
think
things
out
it
began
to
rain
but
he
did
not
mind
into
his
brain
began
to
creep
a
dream
of
a
vast
order
coming
out
of
disorder
he
was
like
one
standing
in
the
presence
of
some
gigantic
machine
with
many
intricate
parts
that
had
begun
to
run
crazily
each
part
without
regard
to
the
purpose
of
the
whole
there
is
danger
in
thinking
too
he
muttered
vaguely
everywhere
there
is
danger
in
labour
in
love
and
in
thinking
what
shall
i
do
with
myself
mcgregor
turned
about
and
threw
up
his
hands
a
new
thought
swept
like
a
broad
path
of
light
across
the
darkness
of
his
mind
he
began
to
see
that
the
soldiers
who
had
led
thousands
of
men
into
battle
had
appealed
to
him
because
in
the
working
out
of
their
purposes
they
had
used
human
lives
with
the
recklessness
of
gods
they
had
found
the
courage
to
do
that
and
their
courage
was
magnificent
away
down
deep
in
the
hearts
of
men
lay
sleeping
a
love
of
order
and
they
had
taken
hold
of
that
love
if
they
had
used
it
badly
did
that
matter
had
they
not
pointed
the
way
back
into
mcgregor
mind
came
a
night
scene
in
his
home
town
vividly
he
saw
in
fancy
the
poor
unkempt
little
street
facing
the
railroad
tracks
and
the
groups
of
striking
miners
huddled
in
the
light
before
the
door
of
a
saloon
while
in
the
road
a
body
of
soldiers
marched
past
their
uniforms
looking
grey
and
their
faces
grim
in
the
uncertain
light
they
marched
whispered
mcgregor
that
what
made
them
seem
so
powerful
they
were
just
ordinary
men
but
they
went
swinging
along
all
as
one
man
something
in
that
fact
ennobled
them
that
what
grant
knew
and
what
caesar
knew
that
what
made
grant
and
caesar
seem
so
big
they
knew
and
they
were
not
afraid
to
use
their
knowledge
perhaps
they
did
not
bother
to
think
how
it
would
all
come
out
they
hoped
for
another
kind
of
man
to
do
the
thinking
perhaps
they
did
not
think
of
anything
at
all
but
just
went
ahead
and
tried
to
do
each
his
own
part
i
will
do
my
part
here
shouted
mcgregor
i
will
find
the
his
body
shook
and
his
voice
roared
along
the
footpath
of
the
bridge
men
stopped
to
look
back
at
the
big
shouting
figure
two
women
walking
past
screamed
and
ran
into
the
roadway
mcgregor
walked
rapidly
away
toward
his
own
room
and
his
books
he
did
not
know
how
he
would
be
able
to
use
the
new
impulse
that
had
come
to
him
but
as
he
swung
along
through
dark
streets
and
past
rows
of
dark
buildings
he
thought
again
of
the
great
machine
running
crazily
and
without
purpose
and
was
glad
he
was
not
a
part
of
it
i
will
keep
myself
to
myself
and
be
ready
for
what
happens
he
said
burning
with
new
courage

chapter
i
when
mcgregor
had
secured
the
place
in
the
and
went
home
to
the
house
in
wycliff
place
with
his
first
week
pay
twelve
dollars
in
his
pocket
he
thought
of
his
mother
nance
mcgregor
working
in
the
mine
offices
in
the
pennsylvania
town
and
folding
a
five
dollar
bill
sent
it
to
her
in
a
letter
i
will
begin
to
take
care
of
her
now
he
thought
and
with
the
rough
sense
of
equity
in
such
matters
common
to
labouring
people
had
no
intention
of
giving
himself
airs
she
has
fed
me
and
now
i
will
begin
to
feed
her
he
told
himself
the
five
dollars
came
back
keep
it
i
do
want
your
money
the
mother
wrote
if
you
have
money
left
after
your
expenses
are
paid
begin
to
fix
yourself
up
better
get
a
new
pair
of
shoes
or
a
hat
try
to
take
care
of
me
i
wo
have
it
i
want
you
to
look
out
for
yourself
dress
well
and
hold
up
your
head
that
all
i
ask
in
the
city
clothes
mean
a
good
deal
in
the
long
run
it
will
mean
more
to
me
to
see
you
be
a
real
man
than
to
be
a
good
sitting
in
her
rooms
over
the
vacant
in
coal
creek
nance
began
to
get
new
satisfaction
out
of
the
contemplation
of
herself
as
a
woman
with
a
son
in
the
city
in
the
evening
she
thought
of
him
moving
along
the
crowded
thoroughfares
among
men
and
women
and
her
bent
little
old
figure
straightened
with
pride
when
a
letter
came
telling
of
his
work
in
the
night
school
her
heart
jumped
and
she
wrote
a
long
letter
filled
with
talk
of
garfield
and
grant
and
of
lincoln
lying
by
the
burning
pine
knot
reading
his
books
it
seemed
to
her
unbelievably
romantic
that
her
son
should
some
day
be
a
lawyer
and
stand
up
in
a
crowded
court
room
speaking
thoughts
out
of
his
brain
to
other
men
she
thought
that
if
this
great
boy
who
at
home
had
been
so
unmanageable
and
so
quick
with
his
fists
was
to
end
by
being
a
man
of
books
and
of
brains
then
she
and
her
man
cracked
mcgregor
had
not
lived
in
vain
a
sweet
new
sense
of
peace
came
to
her
she
forgot
her
own
years
of
toil
and
gradually
her
mind
went
back
to
the
silent
boy
sitting
on
the
steps
with
her
before
her
house
in
the
year
after
her
husband
death
while
she
talked
to
him
of
the
world
and
thus
she
thought
of
him
a
quiet
eager
boy
going
about
bravely
there
in
the
distant
city
death
caught
nance
mcgregor
off
her
guard
after
one
of
her
long
days
of
toil
in
the
mine
office
she
awoke
to
find
him
sitting
grim
and
expectant
beside
her
bed
for
years
she
in
common
with
most
of
the
women
of
the
coal
town
had
been
afflicted
with
what
is
called
trouble
with
the
now
and
then
she
had
bad
on
this
spring
evening
she
got
into
bed
and
sitting
propped
among
the
pillows
fought
out
her
fight
alone
like
a
animal
that
has
crept
into
a
hole
in
the
woods
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
conviction
came
to
her
that
she
would
die
death
seemed
moving
about
in
the
room
and
waiting
for
her
in
the
street
two
drunken
men
stood
talking
their
voices
concerned
with
their
own
human
affairs
coming
in
through
the
window
and
making
life
seem
very
near
and
dear
to
the
dying
woman
i
been
everywhere
said
one
of
the
men
i
been
in
towns
and
cities
i
do
even
remember
the
names
of
you
ask
alex
fielder
who
keeps
a
saloon
in
denver
ask
him
if
gus
lamont
has
been
the
other
man
laughed
you
been
in
jake
drinking
too
much
beer
he
jeered
nance
heard
the
two
men
stumble
off
down
the
street
the
traveller
protesting
against
the
unbelief
of
his
friend
it
seemed
to
her
that
life
with
all
of
its
colour
sound
and
meaning
was
running
away
from
her
presence
the
exhaust
of
the
engine
over
at
the
mine
rang
in
her
ears
she
thought
of
the
mine
as
a
great
monster
lying
asleep
below
the
ground
its
huge
nose
stuck
into
the
air
its
mouth
open
to
eat
men
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
her
coat
flung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
took
the
shape
and
outline
of
a
face
huge
and
grotesque
staring
silently
past
her
into
the
sky
nance
mcgregor
gasped
and
struggled
for
breath
she
clutched
the
bedclothes
with
her
hands
and
fought
grimly
and
silently
she
did
not
think
of
the
place
to
which
she
might
go
after
death
she
was
trying
hard
not
to
go
there
it
had
been
her
habit
of
life
to
fight
not
to
dream
dreams
nance
thought
of
her
father
drunk
and
throwing
his
money
about
in
the
old
days
before
her
marriage
of
the
walks
she
as
a
young
girl
had
taken
with
her
lover
on
sunday
afternoons
and
of
the
times
when
they
had
gone
together
to
sit
on
the
hillside
overlooking
the
farming
country
as
in
a
vision
the
dying
woman
saw
the
broad
fertile
land
spread
out
before
her
and
blamed
herself
that
she
had
not
done
more
toward
helping
her
man
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
plans
she
and
he
had
made
to
go
there
and
live
then
she
thought
of
the
night
when
her
boy
came
and
of
how
when
they
went
to
bring
her
man
from
the
mine
they
found
him
apparently
dead
under
the
fallen
timbers
so
that
she
thought
life
and
death
had
visited
her
hand
in
hand
in
one
night
nance
sat
stiffly
up
in
bed
she
thought
she
heard
the
sound
of
heavy
feet
on
the
stairs
that
will
be
beaut
coming
up
from
the
shop
she
muttered
and
fell
back
upon
the
pillow

afternoon
walked
again
on
the
streets
of
his
native
town
from
the
station
he
went
at
once
to
the
empty
above
which
he
had
lived
with
his
mother
but
he
did
not
stay
there
for
a
moment
he
stood
bag
in
hand
listening
to
the
voices
of
the
miners
wives
in
the
room
above
and
then
put
the
bag
behind
an
empty
box
and
hurried
away
the
voices
of
women
broke
the
stillness
of
the
room
in
which
he
stood
their
thin
sharpness
hurt
something
within
him
and
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
the
equally
thin
sharp
silence
he
knew
would
fall
upon
the
women
who
were
attending
his
mother
body
in
the
room
above
when
he
came
into
the
presence
of
the
dead
along
main
street
he
went
to
a
hardware
store
and
from
there
went
to
the
mine
office
then
with
a
pick
and
shovel
on
his
shoulder
he
began
to
climb
the
hill
up
which
he
had
walked
with
his
father
when
he
was
a
lad
on
the
train
homeward
bound
an
idea
had
come
to
him
i
will
her
among
the
bushes
on
the
hillside
that
looks
down
into
the
fruitful
valley
he
told
himself
the
details
of
a
religious
discussion
between
two
labourers
that
had
gone
on
one
day
during
the
noon
hour
at
the
warehouse
had
come
into
his
mind
and
as
the
train
ran
eastward
he
for
the
first
time
found
himself
speculating
on
the
possibility
of
a
life
after
death
then
he
brushed
the
thoughts
aside
anyway
if
cracked
mcgregor
does
come
back
it
is
there
you
will
find
him
sitting
on
the
log
on
the
hillside
he
thought
with
the
tools
on
his
shoulder
mcgregor
climbed
the
long
hillside
road
now
deep
with
black
dust
he
was
going
to
dig
the
grave
for
the
burial
of
nance
mcgregor
he
did
not
glare
at
the
miners
who
passed
swinging
their
as
they
had
done
in
the
old
days
but
looked
at
the
ground
and
thought
of
the
dead
woman
and
a
little
wondered
what
place
a
woman
would
yet
come
to
occupy
in
his
own
life
on
the
hillside
the
wind
blew
sharply
and
the
great
boy
just
emerging
into
manhood
worked
vigorously
making
the
dirt
fly
when
the
hole
had
grown
deep
he
stopped
and
looked
to
where
in
the
valley
below
a
man
who
was
hoeing
corn
shouted
to
a
woman
who
stood
on
the
porch
of
a
farm
house
two
cows
that
stood
by
a
fence
in
a
field
lifted
up
their
heads
and
bawled
lustily
it
is
the
place
for
the
dead
to
lie
whispered
mcgregor
when
my
own
time
comes
i
shall
be
brought
up
an
idea
came
to
him
i
will
have
father
body
moved
he
told
himself
when
i
have
made
some
money
i
will
have
that
done
here
we
shall
all
lie
in
the
end
all
of
us
the
thought
that
had
come
to
mcgregor
pleased
him
and
he
was
pleased
also
with
himself
for
thinking
the
thought
the
male
in
him
made
him
throw
back
his
shoulders
we
are
two
of
a
feather
father
and
me
he
muttered
two
of
a
feather
and
mother
has
not
understood
either
of
us
perhaps
no
woman
was
ever
intended
to
understand
jumping
out
of
the
hole
he
strode
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
began
the
descent
toward
the
town
it
was
late
afternoon
and
the
sun
had
gone
down
behind
clouds
i
wonder
if
i
understand
myself
if
any
one
understands
he
thought
as
he
went
swiftly
along
with
the
tools
clanking
on
his
shoulder
mcgregor
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
the
town
and
to
the
dead
woman
in
the
little
room
he
thought
of
the
miners
wives
attendants
to
the
dead
who
would
sit
with
crossed
hands
looking
at
him
and
turned
out
of
the
road
to
sit
on
the
fallen
log
where
once
on
a
sunday
afternoon
he
had
sat
with
the
boy
who
worked
in
the
poolroom
and
where
the
daughter
of
the
undertaker
had
come
to
sit
beside
him
and
then
up
the
long
hill
came
the
woman
herself
as
she
drew
near
he
recognised
her
tall
figure
and
for
some
reason
a
lump
came
into
his
throat
she
had
seen
him
depart
from
the
town
with
the
pick
and
shovel
on
his
shoulder
and
after
waiting
what
she
thought
an
interval
long
enough
to
still
the
tongues
of
gossip
had
followed
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
she
said
climbing
over
logs
and
coming
to
sit
beside
him
for
a
long
time
the
man
and
woman
sat
in
silence
and
stared
at
the
town
in
the
valley
below
mcgregor
thought
she
had
grown
more
pale
than
ever
and
looked
at
her
sharply
his
mind
more
accustomed
to
look
critically
at
women
than
had
been
the
mind
of
the
boy
who
had
once
sat
talking
to
her
on
the
same
log
began
to
inventory
her
body
she
is
already
becoming
stooped
he
thought
i
would
not
want
to
make
love
to
her
along
the
log
toward
him
moved
the
undertaker
daughter
and
with
a
swift
impulse
toward
boldness
slipped
a
thin
hand
into
his
she
began
to
talk
of
the
dead
woman
lying
in
the
upstairs
room
in
the
town
we
have
been
friends
since
you
went
away
she
explained
she
liked
to
talk
of
you
and
i
liked
that
made
bold
by
her
own
boldness
the
woman
hurried
on
i
do
not
want
you
to
misunderstand
me
she
said
i
know
i
ca
get
you
i
not
thinking
of
she
began
to
talk
of
her
own
affairs
and
of
the
dreariness
of
life
with
her
father
but
mcgregor
mind
could
not
centre
itself
on
her
talk
when
they
started
down
the
hill
he
had
the
impulse
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
carry
her
as
cracked
mcgregor
had
once
carried
him
but
was
so
embarrassed
that
he
did
not
offer
to
help
her
he
thought
that
for
the
first
time
some
one
from
his
native
town
had
come
close
to
him
and
he
watched
her
stooped
figure
with
an
odd
new
feeling
of
tenderness
i
wo
be
alive
long
maybe
not
a
year
i
got
the
consumption
she
whispered
softly
as
he
left
her
at
the
entrance
to
the
hallway
leading
up
to
her
home
and
mcgregor
was
so
stirred
by
her
words
that
he
turned
back
and
spent
another
hour
wandering
alone
on
the
hillside
before
he
went
to
see
the
body
of
his
mother
in
the
room
above
the
bakery
mcgregor
sat
at
an
open
window
and
looked
down
into
the
dimly
lighted
street
in
a
corner
of
the
room
lay
his
mother
in
a
coffin
and
two
miners
wives
sat
in
the
darkness
behind
him
all
were
silent
and
embarrassed
mcgregor
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
watched
a
group
of
miners
who
gathered
at
a
corner
he
thought
of
the
undertaker
daughter
now
nearing
death
and
wondered
why
she
had
suddenly
come
so
close
to
him
it
is
not
because
she
is
a
woman
i
know
that
he
told
himself
and
tried
to
dismiss
the
matter
from
his
mind
by
watching
the
people
in
the
street
below
in
the
mining
town
a
meeting
was
being
held
a
box
lay
at
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
and
upon
it
climbed
that
same
young
hartnet
who
had
once
talked
to
mcgregor
and
who
made
his
living
by
gathering
birds
eggs
and
trapping
squirrels
in
the
hills
he
was
frightened
and
talked
rapidly
presently
he
introduced
a
large
man
with
a
flat
nose
who
when
he
had
in
turn
climbed
upon
the
box
began
to
tell
stories
and
anecdotes
designed
to
make
the
miners
laugh
mcgregor
listened
he
wished
the
undertaker
daughter
were
there
to
sit
in
the
darkened
room
beside
him
he
thought
he
would
like
to
tell
her
of
his
life
in
the
city
and
of
how
disorganised
and
ineffective
all
modern
life
seemed
to
him
sadness
invaded
his
mind
and
he
thought
of
his
dead
mother
and
of
how
this
other
woman
would
presently
die
it
just
as
well
perhaps
there
is
no
other
way
no
orderly
march
toward
an
orderly
end
perhaps
one
has
to
die
and
return
to
nature
to
achieve
that
he
whispered
to
himself
in
the
street
below
the
man
upon
the
box
who
was
a
travelling
socialist
orator
began
to
talk
of
the
coming
social
revolution
as
he
talked
it
seemed
to
mcgregor
that
his
jaw
had
become
loose
from
much
wagging
and
that
his
whole
body
was
loosely
put
together
and
without
force
the
speaker
danced
up
and
down
on
the
box
and
his
arms
flapped
about
and
these
also
seemed
loose
not
a
part
of
the
body
vote
with
us
and
the
thing
is
done
he
shouted
are
you
going
to
let
a
few
men
run
things
forever
here
you
live
like
beasts
paying
tribute
to
your
masters
arouse
yourselves
join
us
in
the
struggle
you
yourselves
can
be
masters
if
you
will
only
think
you
will
have
to
do
something
more
than
think
roared
mcgregor
as
he
leaned
far
out
at
the
window
again
as
always
when
he
had
heard
men
saying
words
he
was
blind
with
anger
sharply
he
remembered
the
walks
he
had
sometimes
taken
at
night
in
the
city
streets
and
the
air
of
disorderly
ineffectiveness
all
about
him
and
here
in
the
mining
town
it
was
the
same
on
every
side
of
him
appeared
blank
empty
faces
and
loose
badly
knit
bodies
mankind
should
be
like
a
great
fist
ready
to
smash
and
to
strike
it
should
be
ready
to
knock
down
what
stands
in
its
way
he
cried
astonishing
the
crowd
in
the
street
and
frightening
into
something
like
hysterics
the
two
women
who
sat
with
him
beside
the
dead
woman
in
the
darkened
room
chapter
iii
the
funeral
of
nance
mcgregor
was
an
event
in
coal
creek
in
the
minds
of
the
miners
she
stood
for
something
fearing
and
hating
the
husband
and
the
tall
son
they
had
yet
a
tenderness
for
the
mother
and
wife
she
lost
her
money
handing
us
out
bread
they
said
as
they
pounded
on
the
bar
in
the
saloon
word
ran
about
among
them
and
they
returned
again
and
again
to
the
subject
the
fact
that
she
had
lost
her
man
twice
once
in
the
mine
when
the
timber
fell
and
clouded
his
brain
and
then
later
when
his
body
lay
black
and
distorted
near
the
door
to
the
mccrary
cut
after
the
dreadful
time
of
the
fire
in
the
mine
was
perhaps
forgotten
but
the
fact
that
she
had
once
kept
a
store
and
that
she
had
lost
her
money
serving
them
was
not
forgotten
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
the
miners
came
up
out
of
the
mine
and
stood
in
groups
in
the
open
street
and
in
the
vacant
bake
shop
the
men
of
the
night
shift
had
their
faces
washed
and
had
put
white
paper
collars
about
their
necks
the
man
who
owned
the
saloon
locked
the
front
door
and
putting
the
keys
into
his
pocket
stood
on
the
looking
silently
at
the
windows
of
nance
mcgregor
rooms
out
along
the
runway
from
the
mines
came
other
miners
men
of
the
day
shift
setting
their
dinner
pails
on
the
stone
along
the
front
of
the
saloon
and
crossing
the
railroad
they
kneeled
and
washed
their
blackened
faces
in
the
red
stream
that
flowed
at
the
foot
of
the
embankment
the
voice
of
the
preacher
a
slender
young
man
with
black
hair
and
dark
shadows
under
his
eyes
floated
out
to
the
listening
men
a
train
of
loaded
coke
cars
rumbled
past
along
the
back
of
the
stores
mcgregor
sat
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
dressed
in
a
new
black
suit
he
stared
at
the
wall
back
of
the
head
of
the
preacher
not
hearing
thinking
his
own
thoughts
back
of
mcgregor
sat
the
undertaker
pale
daughter
she
leaned
forward
until
she
touched
the
back
of
the
chair
in
front
and
sat
with
her
face
buried
in
a
white
handkerchief
her
weeping
cut
across
the
voice
of
the
preacher
in
the
closely
crowded
little
room
filled
with
miners
wives
and
in
the
midst
of
his
prayer
for
the
dead
she
was
taken
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
and
had
to
get
up
and
hurry
out
of
the
room
after
the
services
in
the
rooms
above
the
bake
shop
a
procession
formed
on
main
street
like
awkward
boys
the
miners
fell
into
groups
and
walked
along
behind
the
black
hearse
and
the
carriage
in
which
sat
the
dead
woman
son
with
the
minister
the
men
kept
looking
at
each
other
and
smiling
sheepishly
there
had
been
no
arrangement
to
follow
the
body
to
its
grave
and
when
they
thought
of
the
son
and
the
attitude
he
had
always
maintained
toward
them
they
wondered
whether
or
not
he
wanted
them
to
follow
and
mcgregor
was
unconscious
of
all
this
he
sat
in
the
carriage
beside
the
minister
and
with
unseeing
eyes
stared
over
the
heads
of
the
horses
he
was
thinking
of
his
life
in
the
city
and
of
what
he
should
do
there
in
the
future
of
edith
carson
sitting
in
the
cheap
dance
hall
and
of
the
evenings
he
had
spent
with
her
of
the
barber
on
the
park
bench
talking
of
women
and
of
his
life
with
his
mother
when
he
was
a
boy
in
the
mining
town
as
the
carriage
climbed
slowly
up
the
hill
followed
by
the
miners
mcgregor
began
to
love
his
mother
for
the
first
time
he
realised
that
her
life
was
full
of
meaning
and
that
in
her
woman
way
she
had
been
quite
as
heroic
in
her
years
of
patient
toil
as
had
been
her
man
cracked
mcgregor
when
he
ran
to
his
death
in
the
burning
mine
mcgregor
hands
began
to
tremble
and
his
shoulders
straightened
he
became
conscious
of
the
men
the
dumb
blackened
children
of
toil
dragging
their
weary
legs
up
the
hill
for
what
mcgregor
stood
up
in
the
carriage
and
turning
about
looked
at
the
men
then
he
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
carriage
seat
and
watched
them
eagerly
his
soul
crying
out
to
something
he
thought
must
be
hidden
away
among
the
black
mass
of
them
something
that
was
the
keynote
of
their
lives
something
for
which
he
had
not
looked
and
in
which
he
had
not
believed
mcgregor
kneeling
in
the
open
carriage
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
watching
the
marching
men
slowly
toiling
upward
had
of
a
sudden
one
of
those
strange
awakenings
that
are
the
reward
of
stoutness
in
stout
souls
a
strong
wind
lifted
the
smoke
from
the
coke
ovens
and
blew
it
up
the
face
of
the
hill
on
the
farther
side
of
the
valley
and
the
wind
seemed
to
have
lifted
also
some
of
the
haze
that
had
covered
his
eyes
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
along
the
railroad
he
could
see
the
little
stream
one
of
the
blood
red
streams
of
the
mine
country
and
the
dull
red
houses
of
the
miners
the
red
of
the
coke
ovens
the
red
sun
setting
behind
the
hills
to
the
west
and
last
of
all
the
red
stream
flowing
like
a
river
of
blood
down
through
the
valley
made
a
scene
that
burned
itself
into
the
brain
of
the
miner
son
a
lump
came
into
his
throat
and
for
a
moment
he
tried
vainly
to
get
back
his
old
satisfying
hate
of
the
town
and
the
miners
but
it
would
not
come
long
he
looked
down
the
hill
to
where
the
miners
of
the
night
shift
marched
up
the
hill
after
the
carriage
and
the
slowly
moving
hearse
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
like
himself
were
marching
up
out
of
the
smoke
and
the
little
squalid
houses
away
from
the
shores
of
the
blood
red
river
into
something
new
what
mcgregor
shook
his
head
slowly
like
an
animal
in
pain
he
wanted
something
for
himself
for
all
these
men
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
gladly
lie
dead
like
nance
mcgregor
to
know
the
secret
of
that
want
and
then
as
though
in
answer
to
the
cry
out
of
his
heart
the
file
of
marching
men
fell
into
step
an
instantaneous
impulse
seemed
to
run
through
the
ranks
of
stooped
toiling
figures
perhaps
they
also
looking
backward
had
caught
the
magnificence
of
the
picture
scrawled
across
the
landscape
in
black
and
red
and
had
been
moved
by
it
so
that
their
shoulders
straightened
and
the
long
subdued
song
of
life
began
to
sing
in
their
bodies
with
a
swing
the
marching
men
fell
into
step
into
the
mind
of
mcgregor
flashed
a
thought
of
another
day
when
he
had
stood
upon
this
same
hill
with
the
half
crazed
man
who
stuffed
birds
and
sat
upon
a
log
by
the
roadside
reading
the
bible
and
how
he
had
hated
these
men
because
they
did
not
march
with
orderly
precision
like
the
soldiers
who
came
to
subdue
them
in
a
flash
he
knew
that
he
who
had
hated
the
miners
hated
them
no
more
with
napoleonic
insight
he
read
a
lesson
into
the
accident
of
the
men
falling
into
step
behind
his
carriage
a
big
grim
thought
flashed
into
his
brain
some
day
a
man
will
come
who
will
swing
all
of
the
workers
of
the
world
into
step
like
that
he
thought
he
will
make
them
conquer
not
one
another
but
the
terrifying
disorder
of
life
if
their
lives
have
been
wrecked
by
disorder
it
is
not
their
fault
they
have
been
betrayed
by
the
ambitions
of
their
leaders
all
men
have
betrayed
mcgregor
thought
that
his
mind
swept
down
over
the
men
that
the
impulses
of
his
mind
like
living
things
ran
among
them
crying
to
them
touching
them
caressing
them
love
invaded
his
spirit
and
made
his
body
tingle
he
thought
of
the
workers
in
the
chicago
warehouse
and
of
the
millions
of
others
workers
who
in
that
great
city
in
all
cities
everywhere
went
at
the
end
of
the
day
shuffling
off
along
the
streets
to
their
houses
carrying
with
them
no
song
no
hope
nothing
but
a
few
paltry
dollars
with
which
to
buy
food
and
keep
the
endless
hurtful
scheme
of
things
alive
there
is
a
curse
on
my
country
he
cried
everyone
has
come
here
for
gain
to
grow
rich
to
achieve
suppose
they
should
begin
to
want
to
live
here
suppose
they
should
quit
thinking
of
gain
leaders
and
followers
of
leaders
they
are
children
suppose
like
children
they
should
begin
to
play
a
bigger
game
suppose
they
could
just
learn
to
march
nothing
else
suppose
they
should
begin
to
do
with
their
bodies
what
their
minds
are
not
strong
enough
to
do
to
just
learn
the
one
simple
thing
to
march
whenever
two
or
four
or
a
thousand
of
them
get
together
to
mcgregor
thoughts
moved
him
so
that
he
wanted
to
yell
instead
his
face
grew
stern
and
he
tried
to
command
himself
no
wait
he
whispered
train
yourself
here
is
something
to
give
point
to
your
life
be
patient
and
again
his
thoughts
swept
away
running
down
to
the
advancing
men
tears
came
into
his
eyes
men
have
taught
them
that
big
lesson
only
when
they
wanted
to
kill
this
must
be
different
some
one
must
teach
them
the
big
lesson
just
for
their
own
sakes
that
they
also
may
know
they
must
march
fear
and
disorder
and
purposelessness
away
that
must
come
mcgregor
turned
and
compelled
himself
to
sit
quietly
beside
the
minister
in
the
carriage
he
became
bitter
against
the
leaders
of
men
the
figures
in
old
history
that
had
once
loomed
so
big
in
his
mind
they
have
half
taught
them
the
secret
only
to
betray
them
he
muttered
the
men
of
books
and
of
brains
have
done
the
same
that
fellow
in
the
street
last
night
there
must
be
thousands
of
such
talking
until
their
jaws
hang
loose
like
gates
words
mean
nothing
but
when
a
man
marches
with
a
thousand
other
men
and
is
not
doing
it
for
the
glory
of
some
king
then
it
will
mean
something
he
will
know
then
that
he
is
a
part
of
something
real
and
he
will
catch
the
rhythm
of
the
mass
and
glory
in
the
fact
that
he
is
a
part
of
the
mass
and
that
the
mass
has
meaning
he
will
begin
to
feel
great
and
mcgregor
smiled
grimly
that
is
what
the
great
leaders
of
armies
have
known
he
whispered
and
they
have
sold
men
out
they
have
used
that
knowledge
to
subdue
men
to
make
them
serve
their
own
little
mcgregor
continued
to
look
back
at
the
men
and
in
an
odd
sort
of
way
to
wonder
at
himself
and
the
thought
that
had
come
to
him
it
can
be
done
he
presently
said
aloud
it
will
be
done
by
some
one
sometime
why
not
by
me
they
buried
nance
mcgregor
in
the
deep
hole
dug
by
her
son
before
the
log
on
the
hillside
on
the
morning
of
his
arrival
he
had
secured
permission
of
the
mining
company
who
owned
the
land
to
make
this
the
burial
place
of
the
mcgregors
when
the
service
over
the
grave
was
finished
he
looked
about
him
at
the
miners
standing
uncovered
along
the
hill
and
in
the
road
leading
down
into
the
valley
and
felt
that
he
should
like
to
tell
them
what
was
in
his
mind
he
had
an
impulse
to
jump
upon
the
log
beside
the
grave
and
in
the
presence
of
the
green
fields
his
father
loved
and
across
the
grave
of
nance
mcgregor
shout
to
them
saying
your
cause
shall
be
my
cause
my
brain
and
strength
shall
be
yours
your
enemies
i
shall
smite
with
my
naked
instead
he
walked
rapidly
past
them
and
topping
the
hill
went
down
toward
the
town
into
the
gathering
night
mcgregor
could
not
sleep
on
that
last
night
he
was
ever
to
spend
in
coal
creek
when
darkness
came
he
went
along
the
street
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
leading
to
the
home
of
the
undertaker
daughter
the
emotions
that
had
swept
over
him
during
the
afternoon
had
subdued
his
spirit
and
he
wanted
to
be
with
some
one
who
would
also
be
subdued
and
quiet
when
the
woman
did
not
come
down
the
stairs
to
stand
in
the
hallway
as
she
had
done
in
his
boyhood
he
went
up
and
knocked
at
her
door
together
they
went
along
main
street
and
climbed
the
hill
the
undertaker
daughter
walked
with
difficulty
and
was
compelled
to
stop
and
sit
upon
a
stone
by
the
roadside
when
she
attempted
to
rise
mcgregor
gathered
her
into
his
arms
and
when
she
protested
patted
her
thin
shoulder
with
his
big
hand
and
whispered
to
her
be
quiet
he
said
do
not
talk
about
anything
just
be
the
nights
in
the
hills
above
mining
towns
are
magnificent
the
long
valleys
cut
and
slashed
by
the
railroads
and
made
ugly
by
the
squalid
little
houses
of
the
miners
are
half
lost
in
the
soft
blackness
out
of
the
darkness
sounds
emerge
coal
cars
creak
and
protest
as
they
are
pushed
along
rails
voices
cry
out
with
a
long
reverberating
rattle
one
of
the
mine
cars
dumps
its
load
down
a
metal
chute
into
a
car
standing
on
the
railroad
tracks
in
the
winter
little
fires
are
started
along
the
tracks
by
the
workmen
who
are
employed
about
the
tipple
and
on
summer
nights
the
moon
comes
out
and
touches
with
wild
beauty
the
banks
of
black
smoke
that
drift
upward
from
the
long
rows
of
coke
ovens
with
the
sick
woman
in
his
arms
mcgregor
sat
in
silence
on
the
hillside
above
coal
creek
and
let
new
thoughts
and
new
impulses
play
with
his
spirit
the
love
for
the
figure
of
his
mother
that
had
come
to
him
during
the
afternoon
returned
and
he
took
the
woman
of
the
mine
country
into
his
arms
and
held
her
closely
against
his
breast
the
struggling
man
in
the
hills
of
his
own
country
who
was
trying
to
clear
his
soul
of
the
hatred
of
men
bred
in
him
by
the
disorder
of
life
lifted
his
head
and
pressed
the
body
of
the
undertaker
daughter
hard
against
his
own
body
the
woman
understanding
his
mood
picked
with
her
thin
fingers
at
his
coat
and
wished
she
might
die
there
in
the
darkness
in
the
arms
of
the
man
she
loved
when
he
became
conscious
of
her
presence
and
relaxed
the
grip
of
his
arms
about
her
shoulders
she
lay
still
and
waited
for
him
to
forget
again
and
again
to
press
her
tightly
and
let
her
feel
in
her
body
his
massive
strength
and
virility
it
is
a
job
it
is
something
big
i
can
try
to
do
he
whispered
to
himself
and
in
fancy
saw
the
great
disorderly
city
on
the
western
plains
rocked
by
the
swing
and
rhythm
of
men
aroused
and
awakening
with
their
bodies
a
song
of
new
life
book
iv
chapter
i
chicago
is
a
vast
city
and
millions
of
people
live
within
the
limits
of
its
influence
it
stands
at
the
heart
of
america
almost
within
sound
of
the
creaking
green
leaves
of
the
corn
in
the
vast
corn
fields
of
the
mississippi
valley
it
is
inhabited
by
hordes
of
men
of
all
nations
who
have
come
across
the
seas
or
out
of
western
corn
shipping
towns
to
make
their
fortunes
on
all
sides
men
are
busy
making
fortunes
in
little
polish
villages
the
word
has
been
whispered
about
in
america
one
gets
much
money
and
adventurous
souls
have
set
forth
only
to
land
at
last
a
little
perplexed
and
disconcerted
in
narrow
ill
smelling
rooms
in
halstead
street
in
chicago
in
american
villages
the
tale
has
been
told
here
it
has
not
been
whispered
but
shouted
magazines
and
newspapers
have
done
the
job
the
word
regarding
the
making
of
money
runs
over
the
land
like
a
wind
among
the
corn
the
young
men
listen
and
run
away
to
chicago
they
have
vigour
and
youth
but
in
them
has
been
builded
no
dream
no
tradition
of
devotion
to
anything
but
gain
chicago
is
one
vast
gulf
of
disorder
here
is
the
passion
for
gain
the
very
spirit
of
the
bourgeoise
gone
drunk
with
desire
the
result
is
something
terrible
chicago
is
leaderless
purposeless
slovenly
down
at
the
heels
and
back
of
chicago
lie
the
long
corn
fields
that
are
not
disorderly
there
is
hope
in
the
corn
spring
comes
and
the
corn
is
green
it
shoots
up
out
of
the
black
land
and
stands
up
in
orderly
rows
the
corn
grows
and
thinks
of
nothing
but
growth
fruition
comes
to
the
corn
and
it
is
cut
down
and
disappears
barns
are
filled
to
bursting
with
the
yellow
fruit
of
the
corn
and
chicago
has
forgotten
the
lesson
of
the
corn
all
men
have
forgotten
it
has
never
been
told
to
the
young
men
who
come
out
of
the
corn
fields
to
live
in
the
city
once
and
once
only
in
modern
times
the
soul
of
america
was
stirred
the
civil
war
swept
like
a
purifying
fire
through
the
land
men
marched
together
and
knew
the
feel
of
shoulder
to
shoulder
action
brown
stout
bearded
figures
returned
after
the
war
to
the
villages
the
beginning
of
a
literature
of
strength
and
virility
arose
and
then
the
time
of
sorrow
and
of
stirring
effort
passed
and
prosperity
returned
only
the
aged
are
now
cemented
together
by
the
sorrow
of
that
time
and
there
has
been
no
new
national
sorrow
it
is
a
summer
evening
in
america
and
the
citizens
sit
in
their
houses
after
the
effort
of
the
day
they
talk
of
the
children
in
school
or
of
the
new
difficulty
of
meeting
the
high
prices
of
food
stuff
in
cities
the
bands
play
in
the
parks
in
villages
the
lights
go
out
and
one
hears
the
sound
of
hurrying
horses
on
distant
roads
a
thoughtful
man
walking
in
the
streets
of
chicago
on
such
an
evening
sees
women
in
white
shirt
waists
and
men
with
cigars
in
their
mouths
who
sit
on
the
porches
of
the
houses
the
man
is
from
ohio
he
owns
a
factory
in
one
of
the
large
industrial
towns
there
and
has
come
to
the
city
to
sell
his
product
he
is
a
man
of
the
better
sort
quiet
efficient
kindly
in
his
own
community
every
one
respects
him
and
he
respects
himself
now
he
walks
and
gives
himself
over
to
thoughts
he
passes
a
house
set
among
trees
where
a
man
cuts
grass
by
the
streaming
light
from
a
window
the
song
of
the
lawn
mower
stirs
the
walker
he
idles
along
the
street
and
looks
in
through
the
windows
at
prints
upon
the
walls
a
white
clad
woman
sits
playing
on
a
piano
life
is
good
he
says
lighting
a
cigar
it
climbs
on
and
up
toward
a
kind
of
universal
and
then
in
the
light
from
a
street
lamp
the
walker
sees
a
man
staggering
along
the
sidewalk
muttering
and
helping
himself
with
his
hands
upon
a
wall
the
sight
does
not
greatly
disturb
the
pleasant
satisfying
thoughts
that
stir
in
his
mind
he
has
eaten
a
good
dinner
at
the
hotel
he
knows
that
drunken
men
are
often
but
gay
dogs
who
morning
will
settle
down
to
their
work
feeling
secretly
better
for
the
night
of
wine
and
song
my
thoughtful
man
is
an
american
with
the
disease
of
comfort
and
prosperity
in
his
blood
he
strolls
along
and
turns
a
corner
he
is
satisfied
with
the
cigar
he
smokes
and
he
decides
satisfied
with
the
age
in
which
he
lives
agitators
may
howl
he
says
but
on
the
whole
life
is
good
and
as
for
me
i
am
going
to
spend
my
life
attending
to
the
business
in
the
walker
has
turned
a
corner
into
a
side
street
two
men
emerge
from
the
door
of
a
saloon
and
stand
upon
the
sidewalk
under
a
light
they
wave
their
arms
up
and
down
suddenly
one
of
them
springs
forward
and
with
a
quick
forward
thrust
of
his
body
and
the
flash
of
a
clenched
fist
in
the
lamp
light
knocks
his
companion
into
the
gutter
down
the
street
he
sees
rows
of
tall
brick
buildings
hanging
black
and
ominous
against
the
sky
at
the
end
of
a
street
a
huge
mechanical
apparatus
lifts
cars
of
coal
and
dumps
them
roaring
and
rattling
into
the
bowels
of
a
ship
that
lies
tied
in
the
river
the
walker
throws
his
cigar
away
and
looks
about
a
man
walks
before
him
in
the
silent
street
he
sees
the
man
raise
his
fist
to
the
sky
and
notes
with
a
shock
the
movement
of
the
lips
and
the
hugeness
and
ugliness
of
the
face
in
the
lamplight
again
he
goes
on
hurrying
now
around
another
corner
into
a
street
filled
with
pawn
shops
clothing
stores
and
the
clamour
of
voices
in
his
mind
floats
a
picture
he
sees
two
boys
clad
in
white
rompers
feeding
clover
to
a
tame
rabbit
in
a
suburban
back
lawn
and
wishes
he
were
at
home
in
his
own
place
in
his
fancy
the
two
sons
are
walking
under
apple
trees
and
laughing
and
tusseling
for
a
great
bundle
of
newly
pulled
sweet
smelling
clover
the
strange
looking
red
man
with
the
huge
face
he
has
seen
in
the
street
is
looking
at
the
two
children
over
a
garden
wall
there
is
a
threat
in
the
look
and
the
threat
alarms
him
into
his
mind
comes
the
notion
that
the
man
who
looks
over
the
wall
wants
to
destroy
the
future
of
his
children
the
night
advances
down
a
stairway
beside
a
clothing
store
comes
a
woman
with
gleaming
white
teeth
who
is
clad
in
a
black
dress
she
makes
a
peculiar
little
jerking
movement
with
her
head
to
the
walker
a
patrol
wagon
with
clanging
bells
rushes
through
the
street
two
blue
clad
policemen
sitting
stiffly
in
the
seat
a
boy
he
ca
be
above
six
runs
along
the
street
pushing
soiled
newspapers
under
the
noses
of
idlers
on
the
corners
his
shrill
childish
voice
rises
above
the
din
of
the
trolley
cars
and
the
clanging
notes
of
the
patrol
wagon
the
walker
throws
his
cigar
into
the
gutter
and
climbing
the
steps
of
a
street
car
goes
back
to
his
hotel
his
fine
reflective
mood
is
gone
he
half
wishes
that
something
lovely
might
come
into
american
life
but
the
wish
does
not
persist
he
is
only
irritated
and
feels
that
a
pleasant
evening
has
been
in
some
way
spoiled
he
is
wondering
if
he
will
be
successful
in
the
business
that
brought
him
to
the
city
as
he
turns
out
the
light
in
his
room
and
putting
his
head
upon
the
pillow
listens
to
the
noises
of
the
city
merged
now
into
a
quiet
droning
roar
he
thinks
of
the
brick
factory
on
the
banks
of
the
river
in
ohio
and
as
he
falls
into
sleep
the
face
of
the
man
lowers
at
him
from
the
factory
door
when
mcgregor
returned
to
the
city
after
the
burial
of
his
mother
he
began
at
once
to
try
to
put
his
idea
of
the
marching
men
into
form
for
a
long
time
he
did
not
know
how
to
begin
the
idea
was
vague
and
shadowy
it
belonged
to
the
nights
in
the
hills
of
his
own
country
and
seemed
a
little
absurd
when
he
tried
to
think
of
it
in
the
daylight
of
north
state
street
in
chicago
mcgregor
felt
that
he
had
to
prepare
himself
he
believed
that
he
could
study
books
and
learn
much
from
men
ideas
expressed
in
books
without
being
overwhelmed
by
their
thoughts
he
became
a
student
and
quit
the
place
in
the
to
the
secret
relief
of
the
little
superintendent
who
had
never
been
able
to
get
himself
up
to
the
point
of
raging
at
this
big
red
fellow
as
he
had
raged
at
the
german
before
mcgregor
time
the
warehouse
man
felt
that
during
the
meeting
on
the
corner
before
the
saloon
on
the
day
mcgregor
began
to
work
for
him
something
had
happened
the
miner
son
had
unmanned
him
a
man
ought
to
be
boss
in
his
own
place
he
sometimes
muttered
to
himself
as
he
walked
in
the
passageways
among
rows
of
piled
apple
barrels
in
the
upper
part
of
the
warehouse
wondering
why
the
presence
of
mcgregor
irritated
him
from
six
in
the
evening
until
two
in
the
morning
mcgregor
now
worked
as
in
a
restaurant
on
south
state
street
below
van
buren
and
from
two
until
seven
in
the
morning
he
slept
in
a
room
whose
windows
looked
down
into
michigan
boulevard
on
thursday
he
was
free
his
place
being
taken
for
the
evening
by
the
man
who
owned
the
restaurant
a
small
excitable
irishman
by
the
name
of
tom
mcgregor
got
his
chance
to
become
a
student
through
the
bank
account
belonging
to
edith
carson
the
opportunity
arose
in
this
way
on
a
summer
evening
after
his
return
from
pennsylvania
he
sat
with
her
in
the
darkened
store
back
of
the
closed
screen
door
mcgregor
was
morose
and
silent
on
the
evening
before
he
had
tried
to
talk
to
several
men
at
the
warehouse
about
the
marching
men
and
they
had
not
understood
he
blamed
his
inability
with
words
and
sat
in
the
half
darkness
with
his
face
in
his
hands
and
looked
up
the
street
saying
nothing
and
thinking
bitter
thoughts
the
idea
that
had
come
to
him
made
him
half
drunk
with
its
possibilities
and
he
knew
that
he
must
not
let
it
make
him
drunk
he
wanted
to
begin
forcing
men
to
do
the
simple
thing
full
of
meaning
rather
than
the
disorganised
ineffective
things
and
he
had
an
inclination
to
arise
to
stretch
himself
to
run
into
the
streets
and
with
his
great
arms
see
if
he
could
not
sweep
the
people
before
him
starting
them
on
the
long
purposeful
march
that
was
to
be
the
beginning
of
the
rebirth
of
the
world
and
that
was
to
fill
with
meaning
the
lives
of
men
then
when
he
had
walked
the
fever
out
of
his
blood
and
had
frightened
the
people
in
the
streets
by
the
grim
look
in
his
face
he
tried
to
school
himself
to
sit
quietly
waiting
the
woman
sitting
beside
him
in
a
low
rocking
chair
began
trying
to
tell
him
of
something
that
had
been
in
her
mind
her
heart
jumped
and
she
talked
slowly
pausing
between
sentences
to
conceal
the
trembling
of
her
voice
would
it
help
you
in
what
you
want
to
do
if
you
could
quit
at
the
warehouse
and
spend
your
days
in
study
she
asked
mcgregor
looked
at
her
and
nodded
his
head
he
thought
of
the
nights
in
his
room
when
the
hard
heavy
work
of
the
day
in
the
warehouse
seemed
to
have
benumbed
his
brain
besides
the
business
here
i
have
seventeen
hundred
dollars
in
the
savings
bank
said
edith
turning
aside
to
conceal
the
eager
hopeful
look
in
her
eyes
i
want
to
invest
it
i
do
not
want
it
lying
there
doing
nothing
i
want
you
to
take
it
and
make
a
lawyer
of
edith
sat
rigid
in
her
chair
waiting
for
his
answer
she
felt
that
she
had
put
him
to
a
test
in
her
mind
was
a
new
hope
if
he
takes
it
he
will
not
be
walking
out
at
the
door
some
night
and
never
coming
mcgregor
tried
to
think
he
had
not
tried
to
explain
to
her
his
new
notion
of
life
and
did
not
know
how
to
begin
after
all
why
not
stick
to
my
plan
and
be
a
lawyer
he
asked
himself
that
might
open
the
door
i
do
that
he
said
aloud
to
the
woman
both
you
and
mother
have
talked
of
it
so
i
give
it
a
trial
yes
i
take
the
again
he
looked
at
her
as
she
sat
before
him
flushed
and
eager
and
was
touched
by
her
devotion
as
he
had
been
touched
by
the
devotion
of
the
undertaker
daughter
in
coal
creek
i
do
mind
being
under
obligations
to
you
he
said
i
do
know
any
one
else
i
would
take
it
in
the
street
later
the
troubled
man
walked
about
trying
to
make
new
plans
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
he
was
annoyed
by
what
he
thought
to
be
the
dulness
of
his
own
brain
and
he
thrust
his
fist
up
into
the
air
to
look
at
it
in
the
lamplight
i
get
ready
to
use
that
intelligently
he
thought
a
man
wants
trained
brains
backed
up
by
a
big
fist
in
the
struggle
i
going
it
was
then
that
the
man
from
ohio
walked
past
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
attracted
his
attention
to
mcgregor
nostrils
came
the
odour
of
rich
fragrant
tobacco
he
turned
and
stood
staring
at
the
intruder
on
his
thoughts
that
what
i
am
going
to
fight
he
growled
the
comfortable
acceptance
of
a
disorderly
world
the
smug
men
who
see
nothing
wrong
with
a
world
like
this
i
would
like
to
frighten
them
so
that
they
throw
their
cigars
away
and
run
about
like
ants
when
you
kick
over
ant
hills
in
the
chapter
ii
mcgregor
began
to
attend
some
classes
at
chicago
university
and
walked
about
among
the
massive
buildings
erected
for
the
most
part
through
the
bounty
of
one
of
his
country
leading
business
men
wondering
why
the
great
centre
of
learning
seemed
so
little
a
part
of
the
city
to
him
the
university
seemed
something
entirely
apart
not
in
tune
with
its
surrounding
it
was
like
an
expensive
ornament
worn
on
the
soiled
hand
of
a
street
urchin
he
did
not
stay
there
long
one
day
he
got
into
disfavour
with
the
professor
in
one
of
the
classes
he
sat
in
a
room
among
other
students
his
mind
busy
with
thoughts
of
the
future
and
of
how
he
might
get
his
movement
of
the
marching
men
under
way
in
a
chair
beside
him
sat
a
large
girl
with
blue
eyes
and
hair
like
yellow
wheat
she
like
mcgregor
was
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
about
her
and
sat
with
eyes
watching
him
in
the
corners
of
her
eyes
lurked
a
gleam
of
amusement
she
drew
sketches
of
his
huge
mouth
and
nose
on
a
pad
of
paper
at
mcgregor
left
with
his
legs
sprawled
into
the
aisle
sat
a
youth
who
was
thinking
of
the
girl
and
planning
a
campaign
against
her
his
father
was
a
manufacturer
of
berry
boxes
in
a
brick
building
on
the
west
side
and
he
wished
he
were
in
school
in
another
city
so
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
live
at
home
all
day
he
thought
of
the
evening
meal
and
of
the
coming
of
his
father
nervous
and
tired
to
quarrel
with
his
mother
about
the
management
of
the
servants
now
he
was
trying
to
evolve
a
plan
for
getting
money
from
his
mother
with
which
to
enjoy
a
dinner
at
a
downtown
restaurant
with
delight
he
contemplated
such
an
evening
with
a
box
of
cigarettes
on
the
table
and
the
girl
sitting
opposite
him
under
red
lights
he
was
a
typical
american
youth
of
the
upper
middle
class
and
was
in
the
university
only
because
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
begin
his
life
in
the
commercial
world
in
front
of
mcgregor
sat
another
typical
student
a
pale
nervous
young
man
who
drummed
with
his
fingers
on
the
back
of
a
book
he
was
very
serious
about
acquiring
learning
and
when
the
professor
paused
in
his
talk
he
threw
up
his
hands
and
asked
a
question
when
the
professor
smiled
he
laughed
loudly
he
was
like
an
instrument
on
which
the
professor
struck
chords
the
professor
a
short
man
with
a
bushy
black
beard
heavy
shoulders
and
large
powerful
spoke
in
a
shrill
voice
surcharged
with
excitement
the
world
is
full
of
unrest
he
said
men
are
struggling
like
chicks
in
the
shell
in
the
hinterland
of
every
man
mind
uneasy
thoughts
stir
i
call
your
attention
to
what
is
going
on
in
the
universities
of
the
professor
paused
and
glared
about
mcgregor
was
so
irritated
by
what
he
took
to
be
the
wordiness
of
the
man
that
he
could
not
restrain
himself
he
felt
as
he
had
felt
when
the
socialist
orator
talked
on
the
streets
of
coal
creek
with
an
oath
he
arose
and
kicked
out
his
foot
to
push
his
chair
away
the
pad
of
paper
fell
out
of
the
large
girl
lap
and
scattered
its
leaves
about
the
floor
a
light
burned
in
blue
eyes
as
he
stood
in
the
classroom
before
the
startled
class
his
head
big
and
red
had
something
of
nobility
about
it
like
the
head
of
a
fine
beast
his
voice
rumbled
out
of
his
throat
and
the
girl
looked
at
him
her
mouth
standing
open
we
go
from
room
to
room
hearing
talk
began
mcgregor
on
the
street
corners
downtown
in
the
evenings
and
in
towns
and
villages
men
talk
and
talk
books
are
written
jaws
wag
the
jaws
of
men
are
loose
they
wabble
about
saying
mcgregor
excitement
grew
if
there
is
all
this
unrest
why
does
it
not
come
to
something
he
demanded
why
do
not
you
who
have
trained
brains
strive
to
find
the
secret
of
order
in
the
midst
of
this
disorder
why
is
something
not
done
the
professor
ran
up
and
down
on
the
platform
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
he
cried
nervously
mcgregor
turned
slowly
and
stared
at
the
class
he
tried
to
explain
why
do
not
men
lead
their
lives
like
men
he
asked
they
must
be
taught
to
march
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
do
you
not
think
so
mcgregor
voice
rose
and
his
great
fist
was
raised
the
world
should
become
a
great
camp
he
cried
the
brains
of
the
world
should
be
at
the
organisation
of
mankind
everywhere
there
is
disorder
and
men
chatter
like
monkeys
in
a
cage
why
should
some
man
not
begin
the
organisation
of
a
new
army
if
there
are
men
who
do
not
understand
what
is
meant
let
them
be
knocked
the
professor
leaned
forward
and
peered
through
his
spectacles
at
mcgregor
i
understand
your
kind
he
said
and
his
voice
trembled
the
class
is
dismissed
we
deprecate
violence
the
professor
hurried
through
a
door
and
down
a
long
hallway
with
the
class
chattering
at
his
heels
mcgregor
sat
in
his
chair
in
the
empty
class
room
and
stared
at
the
wall
as
the
professor
hurried
away
he
muttered
to
himself
what
getting
in
here
what
getting
into
our
schools
late
on
the
following
afternoon
mcgregor
sat
in
his
room
thinking
of
what
had
happened
in
the
class
he
had
decided
that
he
would
not
spend
any
more
time
at
the
university
but
would
devote
himself
entirely
to
the
study
of
law
several
young
men
came
in
among
the
students
at
the
university
mcgregor
had
seemed
very
old
secretly
he
was
much
admired
and
had
often
been
the
subject
of
talk
those
who
had
now
come
to
see
him
wanted
him
to
join
a
greek
letter
fraternity
they
sat
about
his
room
on
the
window
sill
and
on
a
trunk
by
the
wall
they
smoked
pipes
and
were
boyishly
eager
and
enthusiastic
a
glow
shone
in
the
cheeks
of
the
spokesman
a
youth
with
black
curly
hair
and
round
pink
and
white
cheeks
the
son
of
a
presbyterian
minister
from
iowa
you
have
been
picked
by
our
fellows
to
be
one
of
us
said
the
spokesman
we
want
you
to
become
an
alpha
beta
pi
it
is
a
grand
fraternity
with
chapters
in
the
best
schools
in
the
country
let
me
tell
he
began
reeling
off
a
list
of
names
of
statesmen
college
professors
business
men
and
well
known
athletes
who
belonged
to
the
order
mcgregor
sat
by
the
wall
looking
at
his
guests
and
wondering
what
he
would
say
he
was
a
little
amused
and
half
hurt
and
felt
like
a
man
who
has
had
a
sunday
school
scholar
stop
him
on
the
street
to
ask
him
about
the
welfare
of
his
soul
he
thought
of
edith
carson
waiting
for
him
in
her
store
on
monroe
street
of
the
angry
miners
standing
in
the
saloon
in
coal
creek
plotting
to
break
into
the
restaurant
while
he
sat
with
the
hammer
in
his
hands
waiting
for
battle
of
old
mother
misery
walking
at
the
heels
of
the
soldiers
horses
through
the
streets
of
the
mining
village
and
last
of
all
of
the
terrible
certainty
that
these
boys
would
be
destroyed
swallowed
up
by
the
huge
commercial
city
in
which
they
were
to
live
it
means
a
lot
to
be
one
of
us
when
a
chap
gets
out
into
the
world
the
youth
said
it
helps
you
get
on
get
in
with
the
right
people
you
ca
go
on
without
men
you
know
you
ought
to
get
in
with
the
best
he
hesitated
and
looked
at
the
floor
i
do
mind
telling
you
he
said
with
an
outburst
of
frankness
that
one
of
our
stronger
men
whiteside
the
mathematician
wanted
us
to
have
you
he
said
you
were
worth
while
he
thought
you
ought
to
see
us
and
get
to
know
us
and
that
we
ought
to
see
and
get
to
know
mcgregor
got
up
and
took
his
hat
from
a
nail
on
the
wall
he
felt
the
utter
futility
of
trying
to
express
what
was
in
his
mind
and
walked
down
the
stairs
to
the
street
with
the
file
of
boys
following
in
embarrassed
silence
and
stumbling
in
the
darkness
of
the
hallway
at
his
heels
at
the
street
door
he
stopped
and
faced
them
struggling
to
put
his
thoughts
into
words
i
ca
do
what
you
ask
he
said
i
like
you
and
like
your
asking
me
to
come
in
with
you
but
i
going
to
quit
the
his
voice
softened
i
would
like
to
have
you
for
friends
he
added
you
say
a
man
needs
to
know
people
after
awhile
well
i
would
like
to
know
you
while
you
are
what
you
are
now
i
do
want
to
know
you
after
you
become
what
you
will
mcgregor
turned
and
ran
down
the
remaining
steps
to
the
stone
sidewalk
and
went
rapidly
up
the
street
a
stern
hard
look
was
in
his
face
and
he
knew
he
would
spend
a
silent
night
thinking
of
what
had
happened
i
hate
hitting
boys
he
thought
as
he
hurried
away
to
his
evening
work
at
the
restaurant
chapter
iii
when
mcgregor
was
admitted
to
the
bar
and
ready
to
take
his
place
among
the
thousands
of
young
lawyers
scattered
over
the
chicago
loop
district
he
half
drew
back
from
beginning
the
practice
of
his
profession
to
spend
his
life
quibbling
over
trifles
with
other
lawyers
was
not
what
he
wanted
to
have
his
place
in
life
fixed
by
his
ability
in
quibbling
seemed
to
him
hideous
night
after
night
he
walked
alone
in
the
streets
thinking
of
the
matter
he
grew
angry
and
swore
sometimes
he
was
so
stirred
by
the
meaninglessness
of
whatever
way
of
life
offered
itself
that
he
was
tempted
to
leave
the
city
and
become
a
tramp
one
of
the
hordes
of
adventurous
dissatisfied
souls
who
spend
their
lives
drifting
back
and
forth
along
the
american
railroads
he
continued
to
work
in
the
south
state
street
restaurant
that
got
its
patronage
from
the
underworld
in
the
evenings
from
six
until
twelve
trade
was
quiet
and
he
sat
reading
books
and
watching
the
restless
thrashing
crowds
that
passed
the
window
sometimes
he
became
so
absorbed
that
one
of
the
guests
sidled
past
and
escaped
through
the
door
without
paying
his
bill
in
state
street
the
people
moved
up
and
down
nervously
wandering
here
and
there
going
without
purpose
like
cattle
confined
in
a
corral
women
in
cheap
imitations
of
the
gowns
worn
by
their
sisters
two
blocks
away
in
michigan
avenue
and
with
painted
faces
leered
at
the
men
in
gaudily
lighted
that
housed
cheap
suggestive
shows
pianos
kept
up
a
constant
din
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
who
idled
away
the
evenings
in
south
state
street
was
the
vacant
purposeless
stare
of
modern
life
accentuated
and
made
horrible
with
the
stare
went
the
shuffling
walk
the
wagging
jaw
the
saying
of
words
meaning
nothing
on
the
wall
of
a
building
opposite
the
door
of
the
restaurant
hung
a
banner
marked
socialist
there
where
modern
life
had
found
perfect
expression
where
there
was
no
discipline
and
no
order
where
men
did
not
move
but
drifted
like
sticks
on
a
beach
hung
the
socialist
banner
with
its
promise
of
the
commonwealth
mcgregor
looked
at
the
banner
and
at
the
moving
people
and
was
lost
in
meditation
walking
from
behind
the
cashier
desk
he
stood
in
the
street
by
the
door
and
stared
about
a
fire
began
to
burn
in
his
eyes
and
the
fists
that
were
thrust
into
his
coat
pockets
were
clenched
again
as
when
he
was
a
boy
in
coal
creek
he
hated
the
people
the
fine
love
of
mankind
that
had
its
basis
in
a
dream
of
mankind
galvanised
by
some
great
passion
into
order
and
meaning
was
lost
in
the
restaurant
after
midnight
trade
briskened
waiters
and
bartenders
from
fashionable
restaurants
of
the
loop
district
began
to
drop
in
to
meet
friends
from
among
the
women
of
the
town
when
a
woman
came
in
she
walked
up
to
one
of
these
young
men
what
kind
of
a
night
have
you
had
they
asked
each
other
the
visiting
waiters
stood
about
and
talked
in
low
tones
as
they
talked
they
absentmindedly
practised
the
art
of
withholding
money
from
customers
a
source
of
income
to
them
they
played
with
coins
pitched
them
into
the
air
palmed
them
made
them
appear
and
disappear
with
marvellous
rapidity
some
of
them
sat
on
stools
along
the
counter
eating
pie
and
drinking
cups
of
hot
coffee
a
cook
clad
in
a
long
dirty
apron
came
into
the
room
from
the
kitchen
and
putting
a
dish
on
the
counter
stood
eating
its
contents
he
tried
to
win
the
admiration
of
the
idlers
by
boasting
in
a
blustering
voice
he
called
familiarly
to
women
seated
at
tables
along
the
wall
at
some
time
in
his
life
the
cook
had
worked
for
a
travelling
circus
and
he
talked
continually
of
his
adventures
on
the
road
striving
to
make
himself
a
hero
in
the
eyes
of
his
audience
mcgregor
read
the
book
that
lay
before
him
on
the
counter
and
tried
to
forget
the
squalid
disorder
of
his
surroundings
again
he
read
of
the
great
figures
of
history
the
soldiers
and
statesmen
who
have
been
leaders
of
men
when
the
cook
asked
him
a
question
or
made
some
remark
intended
for
his
ears
he
looked
up
nodded
and
read
again
when
a
disturbance
started
in
the
room
he
growled
out
a
command
and
the
disturbance
subsided
from
time
to
time
well
dressed
men
half
gone
in
drink
came
and
leaned
over
the
counter
to
whisper
to
him
he
made
a
motion
with
his
hand
to
one
of
the
women
sitting
at
the
tables
along
the
wall
and
idly
playing
with
toothpicks
when
she
came
to
him
he
pointed
to
the
man
and
said
he
wants
to
buy
you
a
the
women
of
the
underworld
sat
at
the
tables
and
talked
of
mcgregor
each
secretly
wishing
he
might
become
her
lover
they
gossiped
like
suburban
wives
filling
their
talk
with
vague
reference
to
things
he
had
said
they
commented
upon
his
clothes
and
his
reading
when
he
looked
at
them
they
smiled
and
stirred
uneasily
about
like
timid
children
one
of
the
women
of
the
underworld
a
thin
woman
with
hollow
red
cheeks
sat
at
a
table
talking
with
the
other
women
of
the
raising
of
white
leghorn
chickens
she
and
her
husband
a
fat
old
roan
a
waiter
in
a
loop
restaurant
had
bought
a
farm
in
the
country
and
she
was
helping
to
pay
for
it
with
the
money
made
in
the
streets
in
the
evening
a
small
woman
who
sat
beside
the
chicken
raiser
reached
up
to
a
raincoat
hanging
on
the
wall
and
taking
a
piece
of
white
cloth
from
the
pocket
began
to
work
out
a
design
in
pale
blue
flowers
for
the
front
of
a
shirtwaist
a
youth
with
unhealthy
looking
skin
sat
on
a
stool
by
the
counter
talking
to
a
waiter
the
reformers
have
raised
hell
with
business
the
youth
boasted
as
he
looked
about
to
be
sure
of
listeners
i
used
to
have
four
women
working
for
me
here
in
state
street
in
world
fair
year
and
now
i
have
only
one
and
she
crying
and
sick
half
the
mcgregor
stopped
reading
the
book
in
every
city
there
is
a
vice
spot
a
place
from
which
diseases
go
out
to
poison
the
people
the
best
legislative
brains
in
the
world
have
made
no
progress
against
this
evil
it
said
he
closed
the
book
threw
it
away
from
him
and
looked
at
his
big
fist
lying
on
the
counter
and
at
the
youth
talking
boastfully
to
the
waiter
a
smile
played
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
opened
and
closed
his
fist
reflectively
then
taking
a
law
book
from
a
shelf
below
the
counter
he
began
reading
again
moving
his
lips
and
resting
his
head
upon
his
hands
mcgregor
law
office
was
upstairs
over
a
secondhand
clothing
store
in
van
buren
street
there
he
sat
at
his
desk
reading
and
waiting
and
at
night
he
returned
to
the
state
street
restaurant
now
and
then
he
went
to
the
harrison
street
police
station
to
hear
a
police
court
trial
and
through
the
influence
of
was
occasionally
given
a
case
that
netted
him
a
few
dollars
he
tried
to
think
that
the
years
spent
in
chicago
were
years
of
training
in
his
own
mind
he
knew
what
he
wanted
to
do
but
did
not
know
how
to
begin
instinctively
he
waited
he
saw
the
march
and
countermarch
of
events
in
the
lives
of
the
people
tramping
on
the
sidewalks
below
his
office
window
saw
in
his
mind
the
miners
of
the
pennsylvania
village
coming
down
from
the
hills
to
disappear
below
the
ground
looked
at
the
girls
hurrying
through
the
swinging
doors
of
department
stores
in
the
early
morning
wondering
which
of
them
would
presently
sit
idling
with
toothpicks
in
and
waited
for
the
word
or
the
stir
on
the
surface
of
that
sea
of
humanity
that
would
be
a
sign
to
him
to
an
onlooker
he
might
have
seemed
but
another
of
the
wasted
men
of
modern
life
a
drifter
on
the
sea
of
things
but
it
was
not
so
the
people
plunging
through
the
streets
afire
with
earnestness
concerning
nothing
had
not
succeeded
in
sucking
him
into
the
whirlpool
of
commercialism
in
which
they
struggled
and
into
which
year
after
year
the
best
of
america
youth
was
drawn
the
idea
that
had
come
into
his
mind
as
he
sat
on
the
hill
above
the
mining
town
grew
and
grew
day
and
night
he
dreamed
of
the
actual
physical
phenomena
of
the
men
of
labour
marching
their
way
into
power
and
of
the
thunder
of
a
million
feet
rocking
the
world
and
driving
the
great
song
of
order
purpose
and
discipline
into
the
soul
of
americans
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
dream
would
never
be
more
than
a
dream
in
the
dusty
little
office
he
sat
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
at
such
times
he
was
convinced
that
mankind
would
go
on
forever
along
the
old
road
that
youth
would
continue
always
to
grow
into
manhood
become
fat
decay
and
die
with
the
great
swing
and
rhythm
of
life
a
meaningless
mystery
to
them
they
will
see
the
seasons
and
the
planets
marching
through
space
but
they
will
not
march
he
muttered
and
went
to
stand
by
the
window
and
stare
down
into
the
dirt
and
disorder
of
the
street
below
chapter
iv
in
the
office
mcgregor
occupied
in
van
buren
street
there
was
another
desk
besides
his
own
the
desk
was
owned
by
a
small
man
with
an
extraordinary
long
moustache
and
with
grease
spots
on
the
lapel
of
his
coat
in
the
morning
he
came
in
and
sat
in
his
chair
with
his
feet
on
his
desk
he
smoked
long
black
stogies
and
read
the
morning
papers
on
the
glass
panel
of
the
door
was
the
inscription
henry
hunt
real
estate
when
he
had
finished
with
the
morning
papers
he
disappeared
returning
tired
and
dejected
late
in
the
afternoon
the
real
estate
business
of
henry
hunt
was
a
myth
although
he
bought
and
sold
no
property
he
insisted
on
the
title
and
had
in
his
desk
a
pile
of
letterheads
setting
forth
the
kind
of
property
in
which
he
specialised
he
had
a
picture
of
his
daughter
a
graduate
of
the
hyde
park
high
school
in
a
glass
frame
on
the
wall
when
he
went
out
at
the
door
in
the
morning
he
paused
to
look
at
mcgregor
and
said
if
any
one
comes
in
about
property
tend
to
them
for
me
i
be
gone

henry
hunt
was
a
collector
of
tithes
for
the
political
bosses
of
the
first
ward
all
day
he
went
from
place
to
place
through
the
ward
interviewing
women
checking
their
names
off
a
little
red
book
he
carried
in
his
pocket
promising
demanding
making
veiled
threats
in
the
evening
he
sat
in
his
flat
overlooking
jackson
park
and
listened
to
his
daughter
play
on
the
piano
with
all
his
heart
he
hated
his
place
in
life
and
as
he
rode
back
and
forth
to
town
on
the
illinois
central
trains
he
stared
at
the
lake
and
dreamed
of
owning
a
farm
and
living
a
free
life
in
the
country
in
his
mind
he
could
see
the
merchants
standing
gossiping
on
the
sidewalk
before
the
stores
in
an
ohio
village
where
he
had
lived
as
a
boy
and
in
fancy
saw
himself
again
a
boy
driving
cows
through
the
village
street
in
the
evening
and
making
a
delightful
little
slap
slap
with
his
bare
feet
in
the
deep
dust
it
was
henry
hunt
in
his
secret
office
as
collector
and
lieutenant
to
the
boss
of
the
first
ward
who
shifted
the
scenes
for
appearance
as
a
public
character
in
chicago
one
night
a
young
man
son
of
one
of
the
city
plunging
millionaire
wheat
speculators
was
found
dead
in
a
little
blind
alley
back
of
a
resort
known
as
polk
street
mary
place
he
lay
crumpled
up
against
a
board
fence
quite
dead
and
with
a
bruise
on
the
side
of
his
head
a
policeman
found
him
and
dragged
him
to
the
street
light
at
the
corner
of
the
alley
for
twenty
minutes
the
policeman
had
been
standing
under
the
light
swinging
his
stick
he
had
heard
nothing
a
young
man
came
up
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
whispered
to
him
when
he
turned
to
go
down
the
alley
the
young
man
ran
away
up
the
street
the
powers
that
rule
the
first
ward
in
chicago
were
furious
when
the
identity
of
the
dead
man
became
known
the
boss
a
little
man
in
a
neat
grey
suit
and
with
a
silky
moustache
stood
in
his
office
opening
and
closing
his
fists
convulsively
then
he
called
a
young
man
and
sent
for
henry
hunt
and
a
well
known
police
official
for
some
weeks
the
newspapers
of
chicago
had
been
conducting
a
campaign
against
vice
swarms
of
reporters
had
the
ward
daily
they
issued
word
pictures
of
life
in
the
underworld
on
the
front
pages
of
the
papers
with
senators
and
governors
and
millionaires
who
had
divorced
their
wives
appeared
also
the
names
of
ugly
brown
chophouse
sam
and
carolina
kate
with
descriptions
of
their
places
their
hours
of
closing
and
the
class
and
quantity
of
their
patronage
a
drunken
man
rolled
on
the
floor
at
the
back
of
a
street
saloon
and
robbed
of
his
pocketbook
had
his
picture
on
the
front
page
of
the
morning
papers
henry
hunt
sat
in
his
office
on
van
buren
street
trembling
with
fright
he
expected
to
see
his
name
in
the
paper
and
his
occupation
disclosed
the
powers
that
ruled
the
first
quiet
shrewd
men
who
knew
how
to
make
and
to
take
profits
the
very
flower
of
commercialism
were
frightened
they
saw
in
the
prominence
of
the
dead
man
a
real
opportunity
for
their
momentary
enemies
the
press
for
weeks
they
had
been
sitting
quietly
weathering
the
storm
of
public
disapproval
in
their
minds
they
thought
of
the
ward
as
a
kingdom
in
itself
something
foreign
and
apart
from
the
city
among
their
followers
were
men
who
had
not
been
across
the
van
buren
street
line
into
foreign
territory
for
years
suddenly
through
the
minds
of
these
men
floated
a
menace
like
the
small
boss
the
ward
gripped
its
fist
conclusively
through
the
streets
and
alleys
ran
a
cry
a
warning
like
birds
of
prey
disturbed
in
their
nesting
places
they
fluttered
uttering
cries
throwing
his
stogie
into
the
gutter
henry
hunt
ran
through
the
ward
from
house
to
house
he
uttered
his
cry
lay
low
pull
off
the
little
boss
in
his
office
at
the
front
of
his
saloon
looked
from
henry
hunt
to
the
police
official
it
is
no
time
for
hesitation
he
said
it
will
prove
a
boon
if
we
act
quickly
we
have
got
to
arrest
and
try
that
murderer
and
do
it
now
who
is
our
man
quick
let
have
henry
hunt
lighted
a
fresh
stogie
he
played
nervously
with
the
ends
of
his
fingers
and
wished
he
were
out
of
the
ward
and
safely
out
of
range
of
the
prying
eyes
of
the
press
in
fancy
he
could
hear
his
daughter
screaming
with
horror
at
the
sight
of
his
name
spread
in
glaring
letters
before
the
world
and
thought
of
her
with
a
flush
of
abhorrence
on
her
young
face
turning
from
him
forever
in
his
terror
his
mind
darted
here
and
there
a
name
sprang
to
his
lips
it
might
have
been
andy
brown
he
said
puffing
at
the
stogie
the
little
boss
whirled
his
chair
about
he
began
picking
up
the
papers
scattered
about
his
desk
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
again
soft
and
mild
it
was
andy
brown
he
said
whisper
the
word
about
let
a
man
locate
brown
for
you
handle
this
right
and
you
will
save
your
own
scalp
and
get
the
fool
papers
off
the
back
of
the
the
arrest
of
brown
brought
respite
to
the
ward
the
prediction
of
the
shrewd
little
boss
made
good
the
newspapers
dropped
the
clamorous
cry
for
reform
and
began
demanding
instead
the
life
of
andrew
brown
newspaper
artists
rushed
into
police
headquarters
and
made
hurried
sketches
to
appear
an
hour
later
blazoned
across
the
face
of
extras
on
the
streets
grave
scientific
men
got
their
pictures
printed
at
the
heads
of
articles
on
criminal
characteristics
of
the
head
and
an
adept
and
imaginative
writer
for
an
afternoon
paper
spoke
of
brown
as
a
jekyll
and
hyde
of
the
tenderloin
and
hinted
at
other
murders
by
the
same
hand
from
the
comparatively
quiet
life
of
a
not
markedly
industrious
yeggman
brown
came
out
of
the
upper
floor
of
a
state
street
lodging
house
to
stand
stoically
before
the
world
of
men
a
storm
centre
about
which
swirled
and
eddied
the
wrath
of
an
aroused
city
the
thought
that
had
flashed
into
the
mind
of
henry
hunt
as
he
sat
in
the
office
of
the
boss
was
the
making
of
an
opportunity
for
mcgregor
for
months
he
and
andrew
brown
had
been
friends
the
yeggman
a
strongly
built
slow
talking
man
looked
like
a
skilled
mechanic
of
a
locomotive
engineer
coming
into
in
the
quiet
hours
between
eight
and
twelve
he
sat
eating
his
evening
meal
and
talking
in
a
half
bantering
humorous
vein
to
the
young
lawyer
in
his
eyes
lurked
a
kind
of
hard
cruelty
tempered
by
indolence
it
was
he
who
gave
mcgregor
the
name
that
still
clings
to
him
in
that
strange
savage
land
judge
mac
the
big
when
he
was
arrested
brown
sent
for
mcgregor
and
offered
to
give
him
charge
of
his
case
when
the
young
lawyer
refused
he
was
insistent
in
a
cell
at
the
county
jail
they
talked
it
over
by
the
door
stood
a
guard
watching
them
mcgregor
peered
into
the
half
darkness
and
said
what
he
thought
should
be
said
you
are
in
a
hole
he
began
you
do
want
me
you
want
a
big
name
they
all
set
to
hang
you
over
he
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
first
they
going
to
hand
you
over
as
an
answer
to
a
stirred
up
city
it
a
job
for
the
biggest
and
best
criminal
lawyer
in
town
name
the
man
and
i
get
him
for
you
and
help
raise
the
money
to
pay
andrew
brown
got
up
and
walked
to
mcgregor
looking
down
at
him
he
spoke
quickly
and
determinedly
you
do
what
i
say
he
growled
you
take
this
case
i
did
do
the
job
i
was
asleep
in
my
room
when
it
was
pulled
off
now
you
take
the
case
you
wo
clear
me
it
ai
in
the
cards
but
you
get
the
job
just
the
he
sat
down
again
upon
the
iron
cot
at
the
corner
of
the
cell
his
voice
became
slow
and
had
in
it
a
touch
of
cynical
humour
look
here
big
he
said
the
gang
picked
my
number
out
of
the
hat
i
going
across
but
there
good
advertising
in
the
job
for
some
one
and
you
get
chapter
v
the
trial
of
andrew
brown
was
both
an
opportunity
and
a
test
for
mcgregor
for
a
number
of
years
he
had
lived
a
lonely
life
in
chicago
he
had
made
no
friends
and
his
mind
had
not
been
confused
by
the
endless
babble
of
small
talk
on
which
most
of
us
subsist
evening
after
evening
he
had
walked
alone
through
the
streets
and
had
stood
at
the
door
of
the
state
street
restaurant
a
solitary
figure
aloof
from
life
now
he
was
to
be
drawn
into
the
maelstrom
in
the
past
he
had
been
let
alone
by
life
the
great
blessing
of
isolation
had
been
his
and
in
his
isolation
he
had
dreamed
a
big
dream
now
the
quality
of
the
dream
and
the
strength
of
its
hold
upon
him
was
to
be
tested
mcgregor
was
not
to
escape
the
influence
of
the
life
of
his
day
deep
human
passion
lay
asleep
in
his
big
body
before
the
time
of
his
marching
men
he
had
yet
to
stand
the
most
confusing
of
all
the
modern
tests
of
men
the
beauty
of
meaningless
women
and
the
noisy
clamour
of
success
that
is
equally
meaningless
on
the
day
of
his
conversation
with
andrew
brown
in
the
old
cook
county
jail
on
chicago
north
side
we
are
therefore
to
think
of
mcgregor
as
facing
these
tests
after
the
talk
with
brown
he
walked
along
the
street
and
came
to
the
bridge
that
led
over
the
river
into
the
loop
district
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
was
facing
a
fight
and
the
thought
thrilled
him
with
a
new
lift
to
his
shoulders
he
walked
over
the
bridge
he
looked
at
the
people
and
again
let
his
heart
be
filled
with
contempt
for
them
he
wished
that
the
fight
for
brown
were
a
fight
with
fists
boarding
a
west
side
car
he
sat
looking
out
through
the
car
window
at
the
passing
crowd
and
imagined
himself
among
them
striking
right
and
left
gripping
throats
demanding
the
truth
that
would
save
brown
and
set
himself
up
before
the
eyes
of
men
when
mcgregor
got
to
the
monroe
street
millinery
store
it
was
evening
and
edith
was
preparing
to
go
out
to
the
evening
meal
he
stood
looking
at
her
in
his
voice
rang
a
note
of
triumph
out
of
his
contempt
for
the
men
and
women
of
the
underworld
came
boastfulness
they
have
given
me
a
job
they
think
i
ca
do
he
said
i
to
be
brown
counsel
in
the
big
murder
he
put
his
hands
on
her
frail
shoulders
and
pulled
her
to
the
light
i
going
to
knock
them
over
and
show
them
he
boasted
they
think
they
going
to
hang
brown
the
oily
snakes
well
they
did
count
on
me
brown
does
count
on
me
i
going
to
show
he
laughed
noisily
in
the
empty
shop
at
a
little
restaurant
mcgregor
and
edith
talked
of
the
test
he
was
to
go
through
as
he
talked
she
sat
in
silence
and
looked
at
his
red
hair
find
out
if
your
man
brown
has
a
sweetheart
she
said
thinking
of
herself
america
is
the
land
of
murders
day
after
day
in
cities
and
towns
and
on
lonely
country
roads
violent
death
creeps
upon
men
undisciplined
and
disorderly
in
their
way
of
life
the
citizens
can
do
nothing
after
each
murder
they
cry
out
for
new
laws
which
when
they
are
written
into
the
books
of
laws
the
very
lawmaker
himself
breaks
harried
through
life
by
clamouring
demands
their
days
leave
them
no
time
for
the
quietude
in
which
thoughts
grow
after
days
of
meaningless
hurry
in
the
city
they
jump
upon
trains
or
street
cars
and
hurry
through
their
favourite
paper
to
the
ball
game
the
comic
pictures
and
the
market
reports
and
then
something
happens
the
moment
arrives
a
murder
that
might
have
got
a
single
column
on
an
inner
page
of
yesterday
paper
today
spreads
its
terrible
details
over
everything
through
the
streets
hurry
the
restless
scurrying
newsboys
stirring
the
crowds
with
their
cries
the
men
who
have
passed
impatiently
the
tales
of
a
city
shame
snatch
the
papers
and
read
eagerly
and
exhaustively
the
story
of
a
crime
and
into
the
midst
of
such
a
maelstrom
of
rumours
hideous
impossible
stories
and
plans
to
defeat
the
truth
mcgregor
hurled
himself
day
after
day
he
wandered
through
the
vice
district
south
of
van
buren
street
prostitutes
pimps
thieves
and
saloon
looked
at
him
and
smiled
knowingly
as
the
days
passed
and
he
made
no
progress
he
became
desperate
one
day
an
idea
came
to
him
i
go
to
the
good
looking
woman
at
the
settlement
house
he
told
himself
she
wo
know
who
killed
the
boy
but
she
can
find
out
i
make
her
find
in
margaret
ormsby
mcgregor
was
to
know
what
was
to
him
a
new
kind
of
womanhood
something
sure
reliant
hedged
about
and
prepared
as
a
good
soldier
is
prepared
to
have
the
best
of
it
in
the
struggle
for
existence
something
he
had
not
known
was
yet
to
make
its
cry
to
the
man
margaret
ormsby
like
mcgregor
himself
had
not
been
defeated
by
life
she
was
the
daughter
of
david
ormsby
head
of
the
great
plough
trust
with
headquarters
in
chicago
a
man
who
because
of
a
certain
fine
assurance
in
his
attitude
toward
life
had
been
called
ormsby
the
prince
by
his
associates
her
mother
laura
ormsby
was
small
nervous
and
intense
with
a
abandonment
lacking
just
a
shade
of
utter
security
margaret
ormsby
beautiful
in
body
and
beautifully
clad
went
here
and
there
among
the
outcasts
of
the
first
ward
she
like
all
women
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
of
which
she
did
not
talk
even
to
herself
she
was
something
for
the
and
primitive
mcgregor
to
approach
with
caution
hurrying
along
a
narrow
street
lined
with
cheap
saloons
mcgregor
went
in
at
the
door
of
the
settlement
house
and
sat
in
a
chair
at
a
desk
facing
margaret
ormsby
he
knew
something
of
her
work
in
the
first
ward
and
that
she
was
beautiful
and
he
was
determined
that
she
should
help
him
sitting
in
the
chair
and
looking
at
her
across
the
desk
he
choked
back
into
her
throat
the
terse
sentences
with
which
she
was
wont
to
greet
visitors
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
sit
there
dressed
up
and
telling
me
what
women
in
your
position
can
do
and
ca
do
he
said
but
i
come
here
to
tell
you
what
you
will
do
if
you
are
of
the
kind
that
want
to
be
the
speech
of
mcgregor
was
a
challenge
which
margaret
the
modern
daughter
of
one
of
our
modern
great
men
could
not
well
let
pass
had
she
not
brazened
out
her
timidity
to
go
calmly
among
prostitutes
and
sordid
muttering
drunkards
serene
in
her
consciousness
of
purpose
what
is
it
you
want
she
asked
sharply
you
have
just
two
things
that
will
help
me
said
mcgregor
your
beauty
and
your
virginity
these
things
are
a
kind
of
magnet
drawing
the
women
of
the
street
to
you
i
know
i
heard
them
talk
there
are
women
who
come
in
here
who
know
who
it
was
killed
that
boy
in
the
passageway
and
why
it
was
done
mcgregor
went
on
you
a
fetish
with
these
women
they
are
children
and
they
come
in
here
to
look
at
you
as
children
peep
around
curtains
at
guests
sitting
in
the
parlour
of
their
houses
well
i
want
you
to
call
these
children
into
the
room
and
let
them
tell
you
family
secrets
the
whole
ward
here
knows
the
story
of
that
killing
the
air
is
filled
with
it
the
men
and
women
keep
trying
to
tell
me
but
they
afraid
the
police
have
them
scared
and
they
me
and
then
run
away
like
frightened
animals
i
want
them
to
tell
you
you
do
count
with
the
police
down
here
they
think
you
too
beautiful
and
too
good
to
touch
the
real
life
of
these
people
none
of
them
the
bosses
or
the
police
are
watching
you
i
keep
kicking
up
dust
and
you
get
the
information
i
want
you
can
do
the
job
if
you
any
after
mcgregor
speech
the
woman
sat
in
silence
and
looked
at
him
for
the
first
time
she
had
met
a
man
who
overwhelmed
her
and
was
in
no
way
diverted
by
her
beauty
nor
her
self
possession
a
hot
wave
half
anger
half
admiration
swept
over
her
mcgregor
stared
at
the
woman
and
waited
i
got
to
have
facts
he
said
give
me
the
story
and
the
names
of
those
who
know
the
story
and
i
make
them
tell
i
have
some
facts
now
got
them
by
bullying
a
girl
and
by
choking
a
bartender
in
an
alley
now
i
want
you
in
your
way
to
put
me
in
the
way
of
getting
more
facts
you
make
the
women
talk
and
tell
you
and
then
you
tell
when
mcgregor
had
gone
margaret
ormsby
got
up
from
her
desk
in
the
settlement
house
and
walked
across
the
city
toward
her
father
office
she
was
startled
and
frightened
in
a
moment
and
by
the
speech
and
manner
of
this
brutal
young
lawyer
she
had
been
made
to
realise
that
she
was
but
a
child
in
the
hands
of
the
forces
that
played
about
her
in
the
first
ward
her
self
possession
was
shaken
if
they
are
children
these
women
of
the
town
then
i
am
a
child
a
child
swimming
with
them
in
a
sea
of
hate
and
a
new
thought
came
into
her
mind
but
he
is
no
child
that
mcgregor
he
is
a
child
of
nothing
he
stands
on
a
rock
she
tried
to
become
indignant
because
of
the
blunt
frankness
of
the
man
speech
he
talked
to
me
as
he
would
have
talked
to
a
woman
of
the
streets
she
thought
he
was
not
afraid
to
assume
that
at
bottom
we
are
alike
just
playthings
in
the
hands
of
the
man
who
in
the
street
she
stopped
and
looked
about
her
body
trembled
and
she
realised
that
the
forces
about
her
had
become
living
things
ready
to
pounce
upon
her
anyway
i
will
do
what
i
can
i
will
help
him
i
will
have
to
do
that
she
whispered
to
herself
chapter
vi
the
clearing
of
andrew
brown
made
a
sensation
in
chicago
at
the
trial
mcgregor
was
able
to
introduce
one
of
those
dramatic
climaxes
that
catch
the
attention
of
the
mob
at
the
tense
dramatic
moment
of
the
trial
a
frightened
hush
fell
upon
the
court
room
and
that
evening
in
their
houses
men
turned
instinctively
from
the
reading
of
the
papers
to
look
at
their
beloved
sitting
about
them
a
chill
of
fear
ran
over
the
bodies
of
women
for
a
moment
beaut
mcgregor
had
given
them
a
peep
under
the
crust
of
civilisation
that
awoke
an
trembling
in
their
hearts
in
his
fervour
and
impatience
mcgregor
had
cried
out
not
against
the
incidental
enemies
of
brown
but
against
all
modern
society
and
its
formlessness
to
the
listeners
it
seemed
that
he
shook
mankind
by
the
throat
and
that
by
the
power
and
purposefulness
of
his
own
solitary
figure
he
revealed
the
pitiful
weakness
of
his
fellows
in
the
court
room
mcgregor
had
sat
grim
and
silent
letting
the
state
build
up
its
case
in
his
face
was
a
challenge
his
eyes
looked
out
from
beneath
swollen
eyelids
for
weeks
he
had
been
as
tireless
as
a
bloodhound
running
through
the
first
ward
and
building
his
case
policemen
had
seen
him
emerge
from
alleyways
at
three
in
the
morning
the
soft
spoken
boss
hearing
of
his
activities
had
eagerly
questioned
henry
hunt
a
bartender
in
a
dive
on
polk
street
had
felt
the
grip
of
a
hand
at
his
throat
and
a
trembling
girl
of
the
town
had
knelt
before
him
in
a
little
dark
room
begging
protection
from
his
wrath
in
the
court
room
he
sat
waiting
and
watching
when
the
special
counsel
for
the
state
a
man
of
great
name
in
the
courts
had
finished
his
insistent
persistent
cry
for
the
blood
of
the
silent
unemotional
brown
mcgregor
acted
springing
to
his
feet
he
shouted
hoarsely
across
the
silent
court
room
to
a
large
woman
sitting
among
the
witnesses
they
have
tricked
you
mary
he
roared
the
tale
about
the
pardon
after
the
excitement
dies
is
a
lie
they
stringing
you
they
going
to
hang
andy
brown

up
there
and
tell
the
naked
truth
or
his
blood
be
on
your
a
furor
arose
in
the
crowded
court
room
lawyers
sprang
to
their
feet
objecting
protesting
above
the
noise
arose
a
hoarse
accusing
voice
keep
polk
street
mary
and
every
woman
from
her
place
in
here
he
shouted
they
know
who
killed
your
man

them
back
there
on
the
stand
they
tell
look
at
them
the
truth

coming
out
of
the
clamour
in
the
room
subsided
the
silent
attorney
the
joke
of
the
case
had
scored
walking
in
the
streets
at
night
the
words
of
edith
carson
had
come
back
into
his
brain
and
with
the
help
of
margaret

he
had
been
able
to
follow
a
clue
given
by

suggestion
find
out

mary
was
the
sweetheart
of
andy
brown
now
in
the
silent
court
room
the
voice
of
a
woman
arose
broken
with
sobs
to
the
listening
crowd
in
the
packed
little
room
came
the
story
of
the
tragedy
in
the
darkened
house
before
which
stood
the
policeman
idly
swinging
his
night
stick
the
story
of
a
girl
from
an
illinois
village
procured
and
sold
to
the
broker
son
of
the
desperate
struggle
in
the
little
room
between
the
eager
lustful
man
and
the
frightened
girl
of
the
blow
with
the
chair
in
the
hands
of
the
girl
that
brought
death
to
the
man
of
the
women
of
the
house
trembling
on
the
stairs
and
the
body
hastily
pitched
into
the
passageway
they
told
me
they
would
get
andy
off
when
this
blew
over
wailed
the
woman
mcgregor
went
out
of
the
court
room
into
the
street
the
glow
of
victory
was
on
him
and
he
strode
along
with
his
heart
beating
high
his
way
led
over
a
bridge
into
the
north
side
and
in
his
wanderings
he
passed
the
apple
warehouse
where
he
had
made
his
start
in
the
city
and
where
he
had
fought
with
the
german
when
night
came
he
walked
in
north
clark
street
and
heard
the
newsboys
shouting
of
his
victory
before
him
danced
a
new
vision
a
vision
of
himself
as
a
big
figure
in
the
city
within
himself
he
felt
the
power
to
stand
forth
among
men
to
outwit
them
and
outfight
them
to
get
for
himself
power
and
place
in
the
world
the
miner
son
was
half
drunk
with
the
new
sense
of
achievement
that
swept
in
on
him
out
of
clark
street
he
went
and
walked
east
along
a
residence
street
to
the
lake
by
the
lake
he
saw
a
street
of
great
houses
surrounded
by
gardens
and
the
thought
came
that
at
some
time
he
might
have
such
a
house
of
his
own
the
disorderly
clatter
of
modern
life
seemed
very
far
away
when
he
came
to
the
lake
he
stood
in
the
darkness
thinking
of
the
useless
rowdy
of
the
mining
town
suddenly
become
a
great
lawyer
in
the
city
and
the
blood
ran
swiftly
through
his
body
i
am
to
be
one
of
the
victors
one
of
the
few
who
emerge
he
whispered
to
himself
and
with
a
jump
of
the
heart
thought
also
of
margaret
ormsby
looking
at
him
with
her
fine
questioning
eyes
as
he
stood
before
the
men
in
the
court
room
and
by
the
force
of
his
personality
pushed
his
way
through
a
fog
of
lies
to
victory
and
truth
book
v
chapter
i
margaret
ormsby
was
a
natural
product
of
her
age
and
of
american
social
life
in
our
times
as
an
individual
she
was
lovely
although
her
father
david
ormsby
the
plough
king
had
come
up
to
his
position
and
his
wealth
out
of
obscurity
and
poverty
and
had
known
during
his
early
life
what
it
was
to
stand
face
to
face
with
defeat
he
had
made
it
his
business
to
see
that
his
daughter
had
no
such
experience
the
girl
had
been
sent
to
vassar
she
had
been
taught
to
catch
the
fine
distinction
between
clothes
that
are
quietly
and
beautifully
expensive
and
clothes
that
merely
look
expensive
she
knew
how
to
enter
a
room
and
how
to
leave
a
room
and
had
also
a
strong
well
trained
body
and
an
active
mind
added
to
these
things
she
had
without
the
least
knowledge
of
life
a
vigorous
and
rather
high
handed
confidence
in
her
ability
to
meet
life
during
the
years
spent
in
the
eastern
college
margaret
had
made
up
her
mind
that
whatever
happened
she
was
not
going
to
let
her
life
be
dull
or
uninteresting
once
when
a
girl
friend
from
chicago
came
to
the
college
to
visit
her
the
two
went
for
a
day
out
of
doors
and
sat
down
upon
a
hillside
to
talk
things
over
we
women
have
been
fools
margaret
had
declared
if
father
and
mother
think
that
i
am
going
to
come
home
and
marry
some
stick
of
a
man
they
are
mistaken
i
have
learned
to
smoke
cigarettes
and
have
had
my
share
of
a
bottle
of
wine
that
may
not
mean
anything
to
you
i
do
not
think
it
amounts
to
much
either
but
it
expresses
something
it
fairly
makes
me
ill
when
i
think
of
how
men
have
always
patronised
women
they
want
to
keep
evil
things
away
from
us
bah
i
am
sick
of
that
idea
and
a
lot
of
the
other
girls
here
feel
the
same
way
what
right
have
they
i
suppose
some
day
some
little
whiffit
of
a
business
man
will
set
himself
up
to
take
care
of
me
he
had
better
not
i
tell
you
there
is
a
new
kind
of
women
growing
up
and
i
am
going
to
be
one
of
them
i
am
going
to
adventure
to
taste
life
strongly
and
deeply
father
and
mother
might
as
well
make
up
their
minds
to
the
excited
girl
had
walked
up
and
down
before
her
companion
a
mild
looking
young
woman
with
blue
eyes
and
had
raised
her
hands
above
her
head
as
though
to
strike
a
blow
her
body
was
like
the
body
of
a
fine
young
animal
standing
alert
to
meet
an
enemy
and
her
eyes
reflected
the
intoxication
of
her
mood
i
want
all
of
life
she
cried
i
want
the
lust
and
the
strength
and
the
evil
of
it
i
want
to
be
one
of
the
new
women
the
saviours
of
our
between
david
ormsby
and
his
daughter
there
was
an
unusual
bond
six
foot
three
blue
eyed
broad
shouldered
his
presence
had
a
strength
and
dignity
which
marked
him
out
among
men
and
the
daughter
sensed
his
strength
she
was
right
in
that
in
his
way
the
man
was
inspired
under
his
eye
the
trivialities
of
had
become
the
details
of
a
fine
art
in
the
factory
he
never
lost
the
air
of
command
which
inspires
confidence
foremen
running
into
the
office
filled
with
excitement
because
of
a
break
in
the
machinery
or
an
accident
to
a
workman
returned
to
do
his
bidding
quietly
and
efficiently
salesmen
going
from
village
to
village
to
sell
ploughs
became
under
his
influence
filled
with
the
zeal
of
missionaries
carrying
the
gospel
to
the
unenlightened
stockholders
of
the
plough
company
rushing
to
him
with
rumours
of
coming
business
disaster
stayed
to
write
checks
for
new
assessments
on
their
stock
he
was
a
man
who
gave
men
back
their
faith
in
business
and
their
faith
in
men
to
david
was
an
end
in
life
like
other
men
of
his
type
he
had
other
interests
but
they
were
secondary
in
secret
he
thought
of
himself
as
capable
of
a
broader
culture
than
most
of
his
daily
associates
and
without
letting
it
interfere
with
his
efficiency
tried
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
thoughts
and
movements
of
the
world
by
reading
after
the
longest
and
hardest
day
in
the
office
he
sometimes
spent
half
the
night
over
a
book
in
his
room
as
margaret
ormsby
grew
into
womanhood
she
was
a
constant
source
of
anxiety
to
her
father
to
him
it
seemed
that
she
had
passed
from
an
awkward
and
rather
jolly
girlhood
into
a
peculiarly
determined
new
kind
of
womanhood
over
night
her
adventurous
spirit
worried
him
one
day
he
had
sat
in
his
office
reading
a
letter
announcing
her
homecoming
the
letter
seemed
no
more
than
a
characteristic
outburst
from
an
impulsive
girl
who
had
but
yesterday
fallen
asleep
at
evening
in
his
arms
it
confused
him
to
think
that
an
honest
ploughmaker
should
have
a
letter
from
his
little
girl
talking
of
the
kind
of
living
that
he
believed
could
only
lead
a
woman
to
destruction
and
then
the
next
day
there
sat
beside
him
at
his
table
a
new
and
commanding
figure
demanding
his
attention
david
got
up
from
the
table
and
hurried
away
to
his
room
he
wanted
to
readjust
his
thoughts
on
his
desk
was
a
photograph
brought
home
by
the
daughter
from
school
he
had
the
common
experience
of
being
told
by
the
photograph
what
he
had
been
trying
to
grasp
instead
of
a
wife
and
child
there
were
two
women
in
the
house
with
him
margaret
had
come
out
of
college
a
thing
of
beauty
in
face
and
figure
her
tall
straight
body
her
hair
her
soft
brown
eyes
the
air
she
had
of
being
prepared
for
life
challenge
caught
and
held
the
attention
of
men
there
was
in
the
girl
something
of
her
father
bigness
and
not
a
little
of
the
secret
blind
desires
of
her
mother
to
an
attentive
household
on
the
night
of
her
arrival
she
announced
her
intention
of
living
her
life
fully
and
vividly
i
am
going
to
know
things
i
can
not
get
from
books
she
said
i
am
going
to
touch
life
at
many
corners
getting
the
taste
of
things
in
my
mouth
you
thought
me
a
child
when
i
wrote
home
saying
that
i
would
be
cooped
up
in
the
house
and
married
to
a
tenor
in
the
church
choir
or
to
an
young
business
man
but
now
you
are
going
to
see
i
am
going
to
pay
the
price
if
necessary
but
i
am
going
to
in
chicago
margaret
set
about
the
business
of
living
as
though
nothing
were
needed
but
strength
and
energy
in
a
characteristic
american
way
she
tried
to
hustle
life
when
the
men
in
her
own
set
looked
confused
and
shocked
by
the
opinions
she
expressed
she
got
out
of
her
set
and
made
the
common
mistake
of
supposing
that
those
who
do
not
work
and
who
talk
rather
glibly
of
art
and
of
freedom
are
by
that
token
free
men
and
artists
still
she
loved
and
respected
her
father
the
strength
in
him
made
an
appeal
to
the
native
in
her
to
a
young
socialist
writer
who
lived
in
the
settlement
house
where
she
presently
went
to
live
and
who
sought
her
out
to
sit
by
her
desk
berating
men
of
wealth
and
position
she
showed
the
quality
of
her
ideals
by
pointing
to
david
ormsby
my
father
the
leader
of
an
industrial
trust
is
a
better
man
than
all
of
the
noisy
reformers
that
ever
lived
she
declared
he
makes
ploughs
anyway
makes
them
well
millions
of
them
he
does
not
spend
his
time
talking
and
running
his
ringers
through
his
hair
he
works
and
his
work
has
lightened
the
labours
of
millions
while
the
talkers
sit
thinking
noisy
thoughts
and
getting
in
truth
margaret
ormsby
was
puzzled
had
she
been
allowed
by
a
common
fellowship
in
living
to
be
a
real
sister
to
all
other
women
and
to
know
their
common
heritage
of
defeat
had
she
like
her
father
when
he
was
a
boy
but
known
what
it
was
to
walk
utterly
broken
and
beaten
in
the
face
of
men
and
then
to
rise
again
and
again
to
battle
with
life
she
would
have
been
splendid
she
did
not
know
to
her
mind
any
kind
of
defeat
had
in
it
a
touch
of
something
like
immorality
when
she
saw
all
about
her
only
a
vast
mob
of
defeated
and
confused
human
beings
trying
to
make
headway
in
the
midst
of
a
confused
social
organisation
she
was
beside
herself
with
impatience
the
distraught
girl
turned
to
her
father
and
tried
to
get
hold
of
the
keynote
of
his
life
i
want
you
to
tell
me
things
she
said
but
the
father
not
understanding
only
shook
his
head
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
talk
to
her
as
to
a
fine
man
friend
and
a
kind
of
bantering
half
serious
companionship
sprang
up
between
them
the
ploughmaker
was
happy
in
the
thought
that
the
jolly
girl
he
had
known
before
his
daughter
went
to
college
had
come
back
to
live
with
him
after
margaret
went
to
the
settlement
house
she
lunched
with
her
father
almost
every
day
the
hour
together
in
the
midst
of
the
din
that
filled
their
lives
became
for
them
both
a
treasured
privilege
day
after
day
they
sat
for
an
hour
in
a
fashionable
eating
place
renewing
and
strengthening
their
comradeship
laughing
and
talking
amid
the
crowds
delightful
in
their
intimacy
with
each
other
they
playfully
took
on
the
air
of
the
two
men
of
affairs
each
in
turn
treating
the
work
of
the
other
as
something
to
be
passed
over
lightly
secretly
neither
believed
as
he
talked
in
her
effort
to
get
hold
of
and
move
the
sordid
human
wrecks
floating
in
and
out
of
the
door
of
the
settlement
house
margaret
thought
of
her
father
at
his
desk
directing
the
making
of
ploughs
it
is
clean
and
important
work
she
thought
he
is
a
big
and
effective
at
his
desk
in
the
office
of
the
plough
trust
david
thought
of
his
daughter
in
the
settlement
house
at
the
edge
of
the
first
ward
she
is
a
white
shining
thing
amid
dirt
and
ugliness
he
thought
her
whole
life
is
like
the
life
of
her
mother
during
the
hours
when
she
once
lay
bravely
facing
death
for
the
sake
of
a
new
on
the
day
of
her
meeting
with
mcgregor
father
and
daughter
sat
as
usual
in
the
restaurant
men
and
women
passed
up
and
down
the
long
carpeted
aisles
and
looked
at
them
admiringly
a
waiter
stood
at
ormsby
shoulder
anxious
for
the
generous
tip
into
the
air
that
hung
over
them
the
little
secret
atmosphere
of
comradeship
they
cherished
so
carefully
was
thrust
the
sense
of
a
new
personality
floating
in
margaret
mind
beside
the
quiet
noble
face
of
her
father
with
its
stamp
of
ability
and
kindliness
was
another
face
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
talked
to
her
in
the
settlement
house
not
as
margaret
ormsby
daughter
of
david
ormsby
of
the
plough
trust
but
as
a
woman
who
could
serve
his
ends
and
whom
he
meant
should
serve
the
vision
in
her
mind
haunted
her
and
she
listened
indifferently
to
the
talk
of
her
father
she
felt
that
the
stern
face
of
the
young
lawyer
with
its
strong
mouth
and
its
air
of
command
was
as
something
impending
and
tried
to
get
back
the
feeling
of
dislike
she
had
felt
when
first
he
thrust
himself
in
at
the
settlement
house
door
she
succeeded
only
in
recalling
certain
firm
lines
of
purpose
that
offset
and
tempered
the
brutality
of
his
face
sitting
there
in
the
restaurant
opposite
her
father
where
day
after
day
they
had
tried
so
hard
to
build
a
real
partnership
in
existence
margaret
suddenly
burst
into
tears
i
have
met
a
man
who
has
compelled
me
to
do
what
i
did
not
want
to
do
she
explained
to
the
astonished
man
and
then
smiled
at
him
through
the
tears
that
glistened
in
her
eyes
chapter

in
chicago
the
ormsbys
lived
in
a
large
stone
house
in
drexel
boulevard
the
house
had
a
history
it
was
owned
by
a
banker
who
was
a
large
stockholder
and
one
of
the
directors
of
the
plough
trust
like
all
men
who
knew
him
well
the
banker
admired
and
respected
the
ability
and
integrity
of
david
ormsby
when
the
ploughmaker
came
to
the
city
from
a
town
in
wisconsin
to
be
the
master
of
the
plough
trust
he
offered
him
the
house
to
use
the
house
had
come
to
the
banker
from
his
father
a
grim
determined
old
merchant
of
a
past
generation
who
had
died
hated
by
half
chicago
after
toiling
sixteen
hours
daily
for
sixty
years
in
his
old
age
the
merchant
had
built
the
house
to
express

to
chicago
by
a
firm
in
brussels
in
the
long
drawing
room
at
the
front
of
the
house
hung
a
chandelier
that
had
cost
the
merchant
ten
thousand
dollars
the
stairway
leading
to
the
floor
above
was
from
the
palace
of
a
prince
in
venice
and
had
been
bought
for
the
merchant
and
brought
over
seas
to
the
house
in
chicago
the
banker
who
inherited
the
house
did
not
want
to
live
in
it
even
before
the
death
of
his
father
and
after
his
own
unsuccessful
marriage
he
lived
at
a
down
town
club
in
his
old
age
the
merchant
retired
from
business
lived
in
the
house
with
another
old
man
an
inventor
he
could
not
rest
although
he
had
given
up
business
with
that
end
in
view
digging
a
trench
in
the
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
with
his
friend
spent
his
days
trying
to
reduce
the
refuse
of
one
of
his
factories
to
something
having
commercial
value
fires
burned
in
the
trench
and
at
night
the
grim
old
man
hands
covered
with
tar
sat
in
the
house
under
the
chandelier
after
the
death
of
the
merchant
the
house
stood
empty
staring
at
in
the
street
its
walks
and
paths
overgrown
with
weeds
and
rank
grass
david
ormsby
fitted
into
his
house
walking
through
the
long
halls
or
sitting
smoking
his
cigar
in
an
easy
chair
on
the
wide
lawn
he
looked
arrayed
and
environed
the
house
became
a
part
of
him
like
a
and
intelligently
worn
suit
of
clothes
into
the
drawing
room
under
the
ten
thousand
dollar
chandelier
he
moved
a
billiard
table
and
the
click
of
ivory
balls
banished
the
churchliness
of
the
place
up
and
down
the
stairway
moved
american
girls
friends
of
margaret
their
skirts
rustling
and
their
voices
running
through
the
huge
rooms
in
the
evening
after
dinner
david
played
billiards
the
careful
calculation
of
the
angles
and
the
english
interested
him
playing
in
the
evening
with
margaret
or
with
a
man
friend
the
fatigue
of
the
day
passed
and
his
honest
voice
and
reverberating
laugh
brought
a
smile
to
the
lips
of
people
passing
in
the
street
in
the
evening
david
brought
his
friends
to
sit
in
talk
with
him
on
the
wide
verandas
at
times
he
went
alone
to
his
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
buried
himself
in
books
on
saturday
evenings
he
had
a
debauch
and
with
a
group
of
friends
from
town
sat
at
a
card
table
in
the
long
parlour
playing
poker
and
drinking
highballs
laura
ormsby
margaret
mother
had
never
seemed
a
real
part
of
the
life
about
her
even
as
a
child
the
daughter
had
thought
her
hopelessly
romantic
life
had
treated
her
too
well
and
from
every
one
about
her
she
expected
qualities
and
reactions
which
in
her
own
person
she
would
not
have
tried
to
achieve
david
had
already
begun
to
rise
when
he
married
her
the
slender
daughter
of
a
village
shoemaker
and
even
in
those
days
the
little
plough
company
with
its
ownership
scattered
among
the
merchants
and
farmers
of
the
vicinity
had
started
under
his
hand
to
make
progress
in
the
state
people
already
spoke
of
its
master
as
a
coming
man
and
of
laura
as
the
wife
of
a
coming
man
to
laura
this
was
in
some
way
unsatisfactory
sitting
at
home
and
doing
nothing
she
had
still
a
passionate
wish
to
be
known
as
a
character
an
individual
a
woman
of
action
on
the
street
as
she
walked
beside
her
husband
she
beamed
upon
people
but
when
the
same
people
spoke
calling
them
a
handsome
couple
a
flush
rose
to
her
cheeks
and
a
flash
of
indignation
ran
through
her
brain
laura
ormsby
lay
awake
in
her
bed
at
night
thinking
of
her
life
she
had
a
world
of
fancies
in
which
she
at
such
times
lived
in
her
dream
world
a
thousand
stirring
adventures
came
to
her
she
imagined
a
letter
received
through
the
mail
telling
of
an
intrigue
in
which
david
name
was
coupled
with
that
of
another
woman
and
lay
abed
quietly
hugging
the
thought
she
looked
at
the
face
of
the
sleeping
david
tenderly
poor
boy
she
muttered
i
shall
be
resigned
and
cheerful
and
lead
him
gently
back
to
his
old
place
in
my
in
the
morning
after
a
night
spent
in
this
dream
world
laura
looked
at
david
so
cool
and
efficient
and
was
irritated
by
his
efficiency
when
he
playfully
dropped
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
she
drew
away
and
sitting
opposite
him
at
breakfast
watched
him
reading
the
morning
paper
all
unconscious
of
the
rebel
thoughts
in
her
mind
once
after
she
had
moved
to
chicago
and
after
margaret
return
from
college
laura
had
the
faint
suggestion
of
an
adventure
although
it
turned
out
tamely
it
lingered
in
her
mind
and
in
some
way
sweetened
her
thoughts
she
was
alone
on
a
sleeping
car
coming
from
new
york
a
young
man
sat
in
a
seat
opposite
her
and
the
two
fell
into
talk
as
she
talked
laura
imagined
herself
eloping
with
the
young
man
and
under
her
lashes
looked
sharply
at
his
weak
and
pleasant
face
she
kept
the
talk
alive
as
others
in
the
car
crawled
away
for
the
night
behind
the
green
swaying
curtains
with
the
young
man
laura
discussed
ideas
she
had
got
from
reading
ibsen
and
shaw
she
grew
bold
and
daring
in
the
advancing
of
opinions
and
tried
to
stir
the
young
man
to
some
overt
speech
or
action
that
might
arouse
her
indignation
the
young
man
did
not
understand
the
woman
who
sat
beside
him
and
talked
so
boldly
he
knew
of
but
one
prominent
man
named
shaw
and
that
man
had
been
governor
of
iowa
and
later
a
member
of
the
cabinet
of
president
mckinley
it
startled
him
to
think
that
a
prominent
member
of
the
republican
party
should
have
such
thoughts
or
express
such
opinions
he
talked
of
fishing
in
canada
and
of
a
comic
opera
he
had
seen
in
new
york
and
at
eleven
yawned
and
disappeared
behind
the
green
curtains
as
the
young
man
lay
in
his
berth
he
muttered
to
himself
now
what
did
that
woman
want
a
thought
came
into
his
mind
and
he
reached
up
to
where
his
trousers
swung
in
a
little
hammock
above
the
window
and
looked
to
see
that
his
watch
and
were
still
there
at
home
laura
ormsby
nursed
the
thought
of
the
talk
with
the
strange
man
on
the
train
in
her
mind
he
became
something
romantic
and
daring
a
streak
of
light
across
what
she
was
pleased
to
think
of
as
her
sombre
life
sitting
at
dinner
she
talked
of
him
describing
his
charms
he
had
a
wonderful
mind
and
we
sat
late
into
the
night
talking
she
said
watching
the
face
of
david
when
she
had
spoken
margaret
looked
up
and
said
laughingly
have
a
heart
dad
here
is
romance
do
not
be
blind
to
it
mother
is
trying
to
scare
you
about
an
alleged
love
chapter
iii
one
evening
three
weeks
after
the
great
murder
trial
mcgregor
took
a
long
walk
in
the
streets
of
chicago
and
tried
to
plan
out
his
life
he
was
troubled
and
disconcerted
by
the
event
that
had
crowded
in
upon
the
heels
of
his
dramatic
success
in
the
court
room
and
more
than
troubled
by
the
fact
that
his
mind
constantly
played
with
the
dream
of
having
margaret
ormsby
as
his
wife
in
the
city
he
had
become
a
power
and
instead
of
the
names
and
the
pictures
of
criminals
and
keepers
of
disorderly
houses
his
name
and
his
picture
now
appeared
on
the
front
pages
of
newspapers
andrew
leffingwell
the
political
representative
in
chicago
of
a
rich
and
successful
publisher
of
sensational
newspapers
had
visited
him
in
his
office
and
had
proposed
to
make
him
a
political
figure
in
the
city
finley
a
noted
criminal
lawyer
had
offered
him
a
partnership
the
lawyer
a
small
smiling
man
with
white
teeth
had
not
asked
mcgregor
for
an
immediate
decision
in
a
way
he
had
taken
the
decision
for
granted
smiling
genially
and
rolling
a
cigar
across
mcgregor
desk
he
had
spent
an
hour
telling
stories
of
famous
court
room
triumphs
one
such
triumph
is
enough
to
make
a
man
he
declared
you
have
no
idea
how
far
such
a
success
will
carry
you
the
word
of
it
keeps
running
through
men
minds
a
tradition
is
built
up
the
remembrance
of
it
acts
upon
the
minds
of
jurors
cases
are
won
for
you
by
the
mere
connection
of
your
name
with
the
mcgregor
walked
slowly
and
heavily
through
the
streets
without
seeing
the
people
in
wabash
avenue
near
street
he
stopped
in
a
saloon
and
drank
beer
the
saloon
was
in
a
room
below
the
level
of
the
sidewalk
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
sawdust
two
half
drunken
labourers
stood
by
the
bar
quarrelling
one
of
the
labourers
who
was
a
socialist
continually
cursed
the
army
and
his
words
started
mcgregor
to
thinking
of
the
dream
he
had
so
long
held
and
that
now
seemed
fading
i
was
in
the
army
and
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
declared
the
socialist
there
is
nothing
national
about
the
army
it
is
a
privately
owned
thing
here
it
is
secretly
owned
by
the
capitalists
and
in
europe
by
the
aristocracy
do
tell
me
i
know
the
army
is
made
up
of
bums
if
i
a
bum
i
became
one
then
you
will
see
fast
enough
what
fellows
are
in
the
army
if
the
country
is
ever
caught
and
drawn
into
a
great
becoming
excited
the
socialist
raised
his
voice
and
pounded
on
the
bar
hell
we
do
know
ourselves
at
all
he
cried
we
never
have
been
tested
we
call
ourselves
a
great
nation
because
we
are
rich
we
are
like
a
fat
boy
who
has
had
too
much
pie
yes
sir
that
what
we
are
here
in
america
and
as
far
as
our
army
goes
it
is
a
fat
boy
plaything
keep
away
from
mcgregor
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
saloon
and
looked
about
men
came
in
and
went
out
at
the
door
a
child
carried
a
pail
down
the
short
flight
of
steps
from
the
street
and
ran
across
the
sawdust
floor
her
voice
thin
and
sharp
pierced
through
the
babble
of
men
voices
ten
worth
give
me
plenty
she
pleaded
raising
the
pail
above
her
head
and
putting
it
on
the
bar
the
confident
smiling
face
of
finley
the
lawyer
came
back
into
mcgregor
mind
like
david
ormsby
the
successful
maker
of
ploughs
the
lawyer
looked
upon
men
as
pawns
in
a
great
game
and
like
the
ploughmaker
his
intentions
were
honourable
and
his
purpose
clear
he
was
intent
upon
making
much
of
his
life
being
successful
if
he
played
the
game
on
the
side
of
the
criminal
that
was
but
a
chance
things
had
fallen
out
so
in
his
mind
was
something
else
the
expression
of
his
own
purpose
mcgregor
rose
and
went
out
of
the
saloon
in
the
street
men
stood
about
in
groups
at
street
a
crowd
of
youths
scuffling
on
the
sidewalk
pushed
against
the
tall
muttering
man
who
passed
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
began
to
feel
that
he
was
in
the
midst
of
something
too
vast
to
be
moved
by
the
efforts
of
any
one
man
the
pitiful
insignificance
of
the
individual
was
apparent
as
in
a
long
procession
the
figures
of
the
individuals
who
had
tried
to
rise
out
of
the
ruck
of
american
life
passed
before
him
with
a
shudder
he
realised
that
for
the
most
part
the
men
whose
names
filled
the
pages
of
american
history
meant
nothing
the
children
who
read
of
their
deeds
were
unmoved
perhaps
they
had
only
increased
the
disorder
like
the
men
passing
in
the
street
they
went
across
the
face
of
things
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
perhaps
finley
and
ormsby
are
right
he
whispered
they
get
what
they
can
they
have
the
good
sense
to
know
that
life
runs
quickly
like
a
flying
bird
passing
an
open
window
they
know
that
if
a
man
thinks
of
anything
else
he
is
likely
to
become
another
sentimentalist
and
spend
his
life
being
hypnotised
by
the
wagging
of
his
own
in
his
wanderings
mcgregor
came
to
an
restaurant
and
garden
far
out
on
the
south
side
the
garden
had
been
built
for
the
amusement
of
the
rich
and
successful
upon
a
little
platform
a
band
played
although
the
garden
was
walled
about
it
was
open
to
the
sky
and
above
the
laughing
people
seated
at
the
tables
shone
the
stars
mcgregor
sat
alone
at
a
little
table
on
a
balcony
beneath
a
shaded
light
below
him
along
a
terrace
were
other
tables
occupied
by
men
and
women
on
a
platform
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
dancers
appeared
mcgregor
who
had
ordered
a
dinner
left
it
untouched
a
tall
graceful
girl
strongly
suggestive
of
margaret
ormsby
danced
upon
the
platform
with
infinite
grace
her
body
gave
expression
to
the
movements
of
the
dance
and
like
a
thing
blown
by
the
wind
she
moved
here
and
there
in
the
arms
of
her
partner
a
slender
youth
with
long
black
hair
in
the
figure
of
the
dancing
woman
there
was
expressed
much
of
the
idealism
man
has
sought
to
materialise
in
women
and
mcgregor
was
thrilled
by
it
a
sensualism
so
delicate
that
it
did
not
appear
to
be
sensualism
began
to
invade
him
with
a
new
hunger
he
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
he
would
again
see
margaret
upon
the
platform
in
the
garden
appeared
other
dancers
the
lights
at
the
tables
were
turned
low
from
the
darkness
laughter
arose
mcgregor
stared
about
the
people
seated
at
the
tables
on
the
terrace
caught
and
held
his
attention
and
he
began
looking
sharply
at
the
faces
of
the
men
how
cunning
they
were
these
men
who
had
been
successful
in
life
were
they
not
after
all
the
wise
men
behind
the
flesh
that
had
grown
so
thick
upon
their
bones
what
cunning
eyes
there
was
a
game
of
life
and
they
had
played
it
the
garden
was
a
part
of
the
game
it
was
beautiful
and
did
not
all
that
was
beautiful
in
the
world
end
by
serving
them
the
arts
of
men
the
thoughts
of
men
the
impulses
toward
loveliness
that
came
into
the
minds
of
men
and
women
did
not
all
these
things
work
solely
to
lighten
the
hours
of
the
successful
the
eyes
of
the
men
at
the
tables
as
they
looked
at
the
women
who
danced
were
not
too
greedy
they
were
filled
with
assurance
was
it
not
for
them
that
the
dancers
turned
here
and
there
revealing
their
grace
if
life
was
a
struggle
had
they
not
been
successful
in
the
struggle
mcgregor
arose
from
the
table
and
left
his
food
untouched
near
the
entrance
to
the
gardens
he
stopped
and
leaning
against
a
pillar
looked
again
at
the
scene
before
him
upon
the
platform
appeared
a
whole
troupe
of
they
were
dressed
in
garments
and
danced
a
folk
dance
as
mcgregor
watched
a
light
began
to
creep
back
into
his
eyes
the
women
who
now
danced
were
unlike
her
who
had
reminded
him
of
margaret
ormsby
they
were
short
of
stature
and
there
was
something
rugged
in
their
faces
back
and
forth
across
the
platform
they
moved
in
masses
by
their
dancing
they
were
striving
to
convey
a
message
a
thought
came
to
mcgregor
it
is
the
dance
of
labour
he
muttered
here
in
this
garden
it
is
corrupted
but
the
note
of
labour
is
not
lost
there
is
a
hint
of
it
left
in
these
figures
who
toil
even
as
they
mcgregor
moved
away
from
the
shadows
of
the
pillar
and
stood
hat
in
hand
beneath
the
garden
lights
waiting
as
though
for
a
call
out
of
the
ranks
of
the
dancers
how
furiously
they
worked
how
the
bodies
twisted
and
squirmed
out
of
sympathy
with
their
efforts
sweat
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
man
who
stood
watching
what
a
storm
must
be
going
on
just
below
the
surface
of
labour
he
muttered
everywhere
dumb
brutalised
men
and
women
must
be
waiting
for
something
not
knowing
what
they
want
i
will
stick
to
my
purpose
but
i
will
not
give
up
margaret
he
said
aloud
turning
and
half
running
out
of
the
garden
and
into
the
street
in
his
sleep
that
night
mcgregor
dreamed
of
a
new
world
a
world
of
soft
phrases
and
gentle
hands
that
stilled
the
rising
brute
in
man
it
was
a
dream
the
dream
out
of
which
such
women
as
margaret
ormsby
have
been
created
the
long
slender
hands
he
had
seen
lying
on
the
desk
in
the
settlement
house
now
touched
his
hands
uneasily
he
rolled
about
in
bed
and
desire
came
to
him
so
that
he
awakened
on
the
boulevard
people
still
passed
up
and
down
mcgregor
arose
and
stood
in
the
darkness
by
the
window
of
his
room
watching
a
theatre
had
just
spat
forth
its
portion
of
richly
dressed
men
and
women
and
when
he
had
opened
the
window
the
voices
of
the
women
came
clear
and
sharp
to
his
ears
the
distracted
man
stared
into
the
darkness
and
his
blue
eyes
were
troubled
the
vision
of
the
disordered
and
disorganised
band
of
miners
marching
silently
in
the
wake
of
his
mother
funeral
into
whose
lives
he
by
some
supreme
effort
was
to
bring
order
was
disturbed
and
shattered
by
the
more
definite
and
lovely
vision
that
had
come
to
him
chapter
iv
during
the
days
since
she
had
seen
mcgregor
margaret
had
thought
of
him
almost
constantly
she
weighed
and
balanced
her
own
inclinations
and
decided
that
if
the
opportunity
came
she
would
marry
the
man
whose
force
and
courage
had
so
appealed
to
her
she
was
half
disappointed
that
the
opposition
she
had
seen
in
her
father
face
when
she
had
told
him
of
mcgregor
and
had
betrayed
herself
by
her
tears
did
not
become
more
active
she
wanted
to
fight
to
defend
the
man
she
had
secretly
chosen
when
nothing
was
said
of
the
matter
she
went
to
her
mother
and
tried
to
explain
we
will
have
him
here
the
mother
said
quickly
i
am
giving
a
reception
next
week
i
will
make
him
the
chief
figure
let
me
have
his
name
and
address
and
i
will
attend
to
the
laura
arose
and
went
into
the
house
a
shrewd
gleam
came
into
her
eyes
he
will
act
like
a
fool
before
our
people
she
told
herself
he
is
a
brute
and
will
be
made
to
look
like
a
she
could
not
restrain
her
impatience
and
sought
out
david
he
is
a
man
to
fear
she
said
he
would
stop
at
nothing
you
must
think
of
some
way
to
put
an
end
to
margaret
interest
in
him
do
you
know
of
a
better
plan
than
to
have
him
here
where
he
will
look
the
fool
david
took
the
cigar
from
his
lips
he
felt
annoyed
and
irritated
that
an
affair
concerning
margaret
had
been
brought
forward
for
discussion
in
his
heart
he
also
feared
mcgregor
let
it
alone
he
said
sharply
she
is
a
woman
grown
and
has
more
judgment
and
good
sense
than
any
other
woman
i
he
got
up
and
threw
the
cigar
over
the
veranda
into
the
grass
women
are
not
understandable
he
half
shouted
they
do
inexplicable
things
have
inexplicable
fancies
why
do
they
not
go
forward
along
straight
lines
like
a
sane
man
i
years
ago
gave
up
understanding
you
and
now
i
am
being
compelled
to
give
up
understanding
at
ormsby
reception
mcgregor
appeared
arrayed
in
the
black
suit
he
had
purchased
for
his
mother
funeral
his
flaming
red
hair
and
rude
countenance
arrested
the
attention
of
all
about
him
on
all
sides
crackled
talk
and
laughter
as
margaret
had
been
alarmed
and
ill
at
ease
in
the
crowded
court
room
where
a
fight
for
life
went
on
so
he
among
these
people
who
went
about
uttering
little
broken
sentences
and
laughing
foolishly
at
nothing
felt
depressed
and
uncertain
in
the
midst
of
the
company
he
occupied
much
the
same
position
as
a
new
and
ferocious
animal
safely
caught
and
now
on
caged
exhibition
they
thought
it
clever
of
ormsby
to
have
him
and
he
was
in
not
quite
the
accepted
sense
the
lion
of
the
evening
the
rumour
that
he
would
be
there
had
induced
more
than
one
woman
to
cut
other
engagements
and
come
to
where
she
could
take
the
hand
of
and
talk
with
this
hero
of
the
newspapers
and
the
men
shaking
his
hand
looked
at
him
sharply
and
wondered
what
power
and
what
cunning
lay
in
him
in
the
newspapers
after
the
murder
trial
a
cry
had
sprung
up
about
the
person
of
mcgregor
fearing
to
print
in
full
the
substance
of
his
speech
on
vice
its
ownership
and
its
significance
they
had
filled
their
columns
with
talk
of
the
man
the
huge
scotch
lawyer
of
the
tenderloin
was
proclaimed
as
something
new
and
startling
in
the
grey
mass
of
the
city
population
then
as
in
the
brave
days
that
followed
the
man
caught
irresistibly
the
imagination
of
writing
men
himself
dumb
in
written
or
spoken
words
except
in
the
heat
of
an
inspired
outburst
when
he
expressed
perfectly
that
pure
brute
force
the
lust
for
which
sleeps
in
the
souls
of
artists
unlike
the
men
the
beautifully
gowned
women
at
the
reception
had
no
fear
of
mcgregor
they
saw
in
him
something
to
be
tamed
and
conquered
and
they
gathered
in
groups
to
engage
him
in
talk
and
return
the
inquiring
stare
in
his
eyes
they
thought
that
with
such
an
unconquered
soul
about
life
might
take
on
new
fervour
and
interest
like
the
women
who
sat
playing
with
toothpicks
in
restaurant
more
than
one
of
the
women
at
ormsby
reception
had
a
half
unconscious
wish
that
such
a
man
might
be
her
lover
one
after
another
margaret
brought
forward
the
men
and
women
of
her
world
to
couple
their
names
with
mcgregor
and
try
to
establish
him
in
the
atmosphere
of
assurance
and
ease
that
pervaded
the
house
and
the
people
he
stood
by
the
wall
bowing
and
staring
boldly
about
and
thought
that
the
confusion
and
distraction
of
mind
that
had
followed
his
first
visit
to
margaret
at
the
settlement
house
was
being
increased
immeasurably
with
every
passing
moment
he
looked
at
the
glittering
chandelier
on
the
ceiling
and
at
the
people
moving
about
the
men
at
ease
comfortable
the
women
with
wonderfully
delicate
expressive
hands
and
with
their
round
white
necks
and
shoulders
showing
above
their
gowns
and
a
feeling
of
utter
helplessness
pervaded
him
never
before
had
he
been
in
a
company
so
feminine
he
thought
of
the
beautiful
women
about
him
seeing
them
in
his
direct
crude
and
forceful
way
merely
as
females
at
work
among
males
carrying
forward
some
purpose
with
all
the
softly
suggestive
sensuality
of
their
dress
and
their
persons
they
must
in
some
way
have
sapped
the
strength
and
the
purpose
of
these
men
who
move
among
them
so
indifferently
he
thought
within
himself
he
knew
of
nothing
to
set
up
as
a
defence
against
what
he
believed
such
beauty
must
become
to
the
man
who
lived
with
it
its
power
he
thought
must
be
something
monumental
and
he
looked
with
admiration
at
the
quiet
face
of
father
moving
among
his
guests
mcgregor
went
out
of
the
house
and
stood
in
the
half
darkness
on
the
veranda
when
ormsby
and
margaret
followed
he
looked
at
the
older
woman
and
sensed
her
antagonism
the
old
love
of
battle
swept
in
on
him
and
he
turned
and
stood
in
silence
looking
at
her
the
fine
lady
he
thought
is
no
better
than
the
women
of
the
first
ward
she
has
an
idea
i
will
surrender
without
a
out
of
his
mind
went
the
fear
of
the
assurance
and
stability
of
margaret
people
that
had
almost
overcome
him
in
the
house
the
woman
who
had
all
her
life
thought
of
herself
as
one
waiting
only
the
opportunity
to
appear
as
a
commanding
figure
in
affairs
made
by
her
presence
a
failure
of
the
effort
to
submerge
mcgregor
on
the
veranda
stood
the
three
people
mcgregor
the
silent
became
the
talkative
seized
with
one
of
the
inspirations
that
were
a
part
of
his
nature
he
threw
talk
about
sparring
and
returning
thrust
for
thrust
with
ormsby
when
he
thought
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
get
at
the
thing
that
was
in
his
mind
he
went
into
the
house
and
presently
came
out
carrying
his
hat
the
quality
of
harshness
that
crept
into
his
voice
when
he
was
excited
or
determined
startled
laura
ormsby
looking
down
at
her
he
said
i
am
going
to
take
your
daughter
for
a
walk
in
the
street
i
want
to
talk
with
laura
hesitated
and
smiled
uncertainly
she
determined
to
speak
out
to
be
like
the
man
crude
and
direct
when
she
had
her
mind
fixed
and
ready
margaret
and
mcgregor
were
already
half
way
down
the
gravel
walk
to
the
gate
and
the
opportunity
to
distinguish
herself
had
passed
mcgregor
walked
beside
margaret
absorbed
in
thoughts
of
her
i
am
engaged
in
a
work
here
he
said
waving
his
hand
vaguely
toward
the
city
it
is
a
big
work
and
it
takes
a
lot
out
of
me
i
have
not
come
to
see
you
because
i
been
uncertain
i
been
afraid
you
would
overcome
me
and
drive
thoughts
of
the
work
out
of
my
by
the
iron
gate
at
the
end
of
the
gravel
walk
they
turned
and
faced
each
other
mcgregor
leaned
against
the
brick
wall
and
looked
at
her
i
want
you
to
marry
me
he
said
i
think
of
you
constantly
thinking
of
you
i
can
only
half
do
my
work
i
get
to
thinking
that
another
man
may
come
and
take
you
and
i
waste
hour
after
hour
being
she
put
a
trembling
hand
upon
his
arm
and
he
thinking
to
check
an
attempt
at
an
answer
before
he
had
finished
hurried
on
there
are
things
to
be
said
and
understood
between
us
before
i
can
come
to
you
as
a
suitor
i
did
not
think
i
should
feel
toward
a
woman
as
i
feel
toward
you
and
i
have
certain
adjustments
to
make
i
thought
i
could
get
along
without
your
kind
of
women
i
thought
you
were
not
for
me
with
the
work
i
have
thought
out
to
do
in
the
world
if
you
will
not
marry
me
i
be
glad
to
know
now
so
that
i
can
get
my
mind
straightened
margaret
raised
her
hand
and
laid
it
on
his
shoulder
the
act
was
a
kind
of
acknowledgment
of
his
right
to
talk
to
her
so
directly
she
said
nothing
filled
with
a
thousand
messages
of
love
and
tenderness
she
longed
to
pour
into
his
ear
she
stood
in
silence
on
the
gravel
path
with
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
then
an
absurd
thing
happened
the
fear
that
margaret
might
come
to
some
quick
decision
that
would
affect
all
of
their
future
together
made
mcgregor
frantic
he
did
not
want
her
to
speak
and
wished
his
own
words
unsaid
wait
not
now
he
cried
and
threw
up
his
hand
intending
to
take
her
hand
his
fist
struck
the
arm
that
lay
on
his
shoulder
and
it
in
turn
knocked
his
hat
flying
into
the
road
mcgregor
started
to
run
after
it
and
then
stopped
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
and
appeared
lost
in
thought
when
he
turned
again
to
pursue
the
hat
margaret
unable
longer
to
control
herself
shouted
with
laughter
hatless
mcgregor
walked
up
drexel
boulevard
in
the
soft
stillness
of
the
summer
night
he
was
annoyed
at
the
outcome
of
the
evening
and
in
his
heart
half
wished
that
margaret
had
sent
him
away
defeated
his
arms
ached
to
have
her
against
his
breast
but
his
mind
kept
presenting
one
after
another
the
objections
to
marriage
with
her
men
are
submerged
by
such
women
and
forget
their
work
he
told
himself
they
sit
looking
into
the
soft
brown
eyes
of
their
beloved
thinking
of
happiness
a
man
should
go
about
his
work
thinking
of
that
the
fire
that
runs
through
the
veins
of
his
body
should
light
his
mind
one
wants
to
take
the
love
of
woman
as
an
end
in
life
and
the
woman
accepts
that
and
is
made
happy
by
he
thought
with
gratitude
of
edith
in
her
shop
on
monroe
street
i
do
not
sit
in
my
room
at
night
dreaming
of
taking
her
in
my
arms
and
pouring
kisses
on
her
lips
he
whispered
in
the
door
of
her
house
ormsby
had
stood
watching
mcgregor
and
margaret
she
had
seen
them
stop
at
the
end
of
the
walk
the
figure
of
the
man
was
lost
in
shadows
and
that
of
margaret
stood
alone
outlined
against
a
distant
light
she
saw
margaret
hand
thrust
out
was
she
clutching
his
sleeve
and
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
and
then
the
man
precipitating
himself
into
the
street
his
hat
catapulted
ahead
of
him
and
a
quick
outburst
of
laughter
broke
the
stillness
laura
ormsby
was
furious
although
she
hated
mcgregor
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
laughter
should
break
the
spell
of
romance
she
is
just
like
her
father
she
muttered
at
least
she
might
show
some
spirit
and
not
be
like
a
wooden
thing
ending
her
first
talk
with
a
lover
with
a
laugh
like
as
for
margaret
she
stood
in
the
darkness
trembling
with
happiness
she
imagined
herself
going
up
the
dark
stairway
to
mcgregor
office
in
van
buren
street
where
once
she
had
gone
to
take
him
news
of
the
murder
case
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
saying
take
me
in
your
arms
and
kiss
me
i
am
your
woman
i
want
to
live
with
you
i
am
ready
to
renounce
my
people
and
my
world
and
to
live
your
life
for
your
margaret
standing
in
the
darkness
before
the
huge
old
house
in
drexel
boulevard
imagined
herself
with
beaut
mcgregor
living
with
him
as
his
wife
in
a
small
apartment
over
a
fish
market
on
a
west
side
street
why
a
fish
market
she
could
not
have
said
chapter
v
edith
carson
was
six
years
older
than
mcgregor
and
lived
entirely
within
herself
hers
was
one
of
those
natures
that
do
not
express
themselves
in
words
although
at
his
coming
into
the
shop
her
heart
beat
high
no
colour
came
to
her
cheeks
and
her
pale
eyes
did
not
flash
back
into
his
a
message
day
after
day
she
sat
in
her
shop
at
work
quiet
strong
in
her
own
kind
of
faith
ready
to
give
her
money
her
reputation
and
if
need
be
her
life
to
the
working
out
of
her
own
dream
of
womanhood
she
did
not
see
in
mcgregor
the
making
of
a
man
of
genius
as
did
margaret
and
did
not
hope
to
express
through
him
a
secret
desire
for
power
she
was
a
working
woman
and
to
her
he
represented
all
men
in
her
secret
heart
she
thought
of
him
merely
as
the
man
her
man
and
to
mcgregor
edith
was
companion
and
friend
he
saw
her
sitting
year
after
year
in
her
shop
putting
money
into
the
savings
bank
keeping
a
cheerful
front
before
the
world
never
assertive
kindly
in
her
own
way
sure
of
herself
we
could
go
on
forever
as
we
are
now
and
she
be
none
the
less
pleased
he
told
himself
one
afternoon
after
a
particularly
hard
week
of
work
he
went
out
to
her
place
to
sit
in
her
little
workroom
and
think
out
the
matter
of
marrying
margaret
ormsby
it
was
a
quiet
season
in
edith
trade
and
she
was
alone
in
the
shop
serving
a
customer
mcgregor
lay
down
upon
the
little
couch
in
the
workroom
for
a
week
he
had
been
speaking
to
gatherings
of
workmen
night
after
night
and
later
had
sat
in
his
own
room
thinking
of
margaret
now
on
the
couch
with
the
murmur
of
voices
in
his
ears
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
it
was
late
in
the
night
and
on
the
floor
by
the
side
of
the
couch
sat
edith
with
her
ringers
in
his
hair
mcgregor
opened
his
eyes
quietly
and
looked
at
her
he
could
see
a
tear
running
down
her
cheek
she
was
staring
straight
ahead
at
the
wall
of
the
room
and
by
the
dim
light
that
came
through
a
window
he
could
see
the
drawn
cords
of
her
little
neck
and
the
knot
of
mouse
coloured
hair
on
her
head
mcgregor
closed
his
eyes
quickly
he
felt
like
one
who
has
been
aroused
out
of
sleep
by
a
dash
of
cold
water
across
his
breast
it
came
over
him
with
a
rush
that
edith
carson
had
been
expecting
something
from
him
something
he
was
not
prepared
to
give
she
got
up
after
a
time
and
crept
quietly
away
into
the
shop
and
with
a
great
clatter
and
bustle
he
arose
also
and
began
calling
loudly
he
demanded
the
time
and
complained
about
a
missed
appointment
turning
up
the
gas
edith
walked
with
him
to
the
door
on
her
face
sat
the
old
placid
smile
mcgregor
hurried
away
into
the
darkness
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
walking
in
the
streets
the
next
day
he
went
to
margaret
ormsby
at
the
settlement
house
with
her
he
used
no
art
driving
straight
to
the
point
he
told
her
of
the
undertaker
daughter
sitting
beside
him
on
the
eminence
above
coal
creek
of
the
barber
and
his
talk
of
women
on
the
park
bench
and
how
that
had
led
him
to
that
other
woman
kneeling
on
the
floor
in
the
little
frame
house
his
fists
in
her
hair
and
of
edith
carson
whose
companionship
had
saved
him
from
all
of
these
if
you
ca
hear
all
of
this
and
still
want
life
with
me
he
said
there
is
no
future
for
us
together
i
want
you
i
afraid
of
you
and
afraid
of
my
love
for
you
but
still
i
want
you
i
been
seeing
your
face
floating
above
the
audiences
in
the
halls
where
i
been
at
work
i
looked
at
babies
in
the
arms
of
workingmen
wives
and
wanted
to
see
my
babe
in
your
arms
i
care
more
for
what
i
am
doing
than
i
do
for
you
but
i
love
mcgregor
arose
and
stood
over
her
i
love
you
with
my
arms
aching
to
close
about
you
with
my
brain
planning
the
triumph
of
the
workers
with
all
of
the
old
perplexing
human
love
that
i
had
almost
thought
i
would
never
want
i
ca
bear
this
waiting
i
ca
bear
this
not
knowing
so
that
i
can
tell
edith
i
ca
have
my
mind
filled
with
the
need
of
you
just
as
men
are
beginning
to
catch
the
infection
of
an
idea
and
are
looking
to
me
for
leadership
take
me
or
let
me
go
and
live
my
margaret
ormsby
looked
at
mcgregor
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
as
quiet
as
the
voice
of
her
father
telling
a
workman
in
the
shop
what
to
do
with
a
broken
machine
i
am
going
to
marry
you
she
said
simply
i
am
full
of
the
thought
of
it
i
want
you
want
you
so
blindly
that
i
think
you
ca
she
stood
up
facing
him
and
looked
into
his
eyes
you
must
wait
she
said
i
must
see
edith
i
myself
must
do
that
all
these
years
she
has
served
you
she
has
had
that
mcgregor
looked
across
the
table
into
the
beautiful
eyes
of
the
woman
he
loved
you
belong
to
me
even
if
i
do
belong
to
edith
he
said
i
will
see
edith
margaret
answered
again
chapter
vi
mcgregor
left
the
telling
of
the
story
of
his
love
to
margaret
edith
carson
who
knew
defeat
so
well
and
who
had
in
her
the
courage
of
defeat
was
to
meet
defeat
at
his
hands
through
the
undefeated
woman
and
he
let
himself
forget
the
whole
matter
for
a
month
he
had
been
trying
to
get
workingmen
to
take
up
the
idea
of
the
marching
men
without
success
and
after
the
talk
with
margaret
he
kept
doggedly
at
the
work
and
then
one
evening
something
happened
that
aroused
him
the
marching
men
idea
that
had
become
more
than
half
intellectualised
became
again
a
burning
passion
and
the
matter
of
his
life
with
women
got
itself
cleared
up
swiftly
and
finally
it
was
night
and
mcgregor
stood
upon
the
platform
of
the
elevated
railroad
at
state
and
van
buren
streets
he
had
been
feeling
guilty
concerning
edith
and
had
been
intending
to
go
out
to
her
place
but
the
scene
in
the
street
below
fascinated
him
and
he
remained
standing
looking
along
the
lighted
thoroughfare
for
a
week
there
had
been
a
strike
of
teamsters
in
the
city
and
that
afternoon
there
had
been
a
riot
windows
had
been
smashed
and
several
men
injured
now
the
evening
crowds
gathered
and
speakers
climbed
upon
boxes
to
talk
everywhere
there
was
a
great
wagging
of
jaws
and
waving
of
arms
mcgregor
grew
reminiscent
into
his
mind
came
the
little
mining
town
and
he
saw
himself
again
a
boy
sitting
in
the
darkness
on
the
steps
before
his
mother
bake
shop
and
trying
to
think
again
in
fancy
he
saw
the
disorganised
miners
tumbling
out
of
the
saloon
to
stand
on
the
street
swearing
and
threatening
and
again
he
was
filled
with
contempt
for
them
and
then
in
the
heart
of
the
great
western
city
the
same
thing
happened
that
had
happened
when
he
was
a
boy
in
pennsylvania
the
officials
of
the
city
having
decided
to
startle
the
striking
teamsters
by
a
display
of
force
sent
a
regiment
of
state
troops
marching
through
the
streets
the
soldiers
were
dressed
in
brown
uniforms
they
were
silent
as
mcgregor
looked
down
they
turned
out
of
polk
street
and
came
with
swinging
measured
tread
up
state
street
past
the
disorderly
mobs
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
equally
disorderly
speakers
on
the
curb
mcgregor
heart
beat
so
that
he
nearly
choked
the
men
in
the
uniforms
each
in
himself
meaning
nothing
had
become
by
their
marching
together
all
alive
with
meaning
again
he
wanted
to
shout
to
run
down
into
the
street
and
embrace
them
the
strength
in
them
seemed
to
kiss
as
with
the
kiss
of
a
lover
the
strength
within
himself
and
when
they
had
passed
and
the
disorderly
jangle
of
voices
broke
out
again
he
got
on
a
car
and
went
out
to
edith
with
his
heart
afire
with
resolution
edith
carson
millinery
shop
was
in
the
hands
of
a
new
owner
she
had
sold
out
and
fled
mcgregor
stood
in
the
show
room
looking
about
him
at
the
cases
filled
with
their
feathery
finery
and
at
the
hats
along
the
wall
the
light
from
a
street
lamp
that
came
in
at
the
window
started
millions
of
tiny
motes
dancing
before
his
eyes
out
of
the
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
the
room
where
he
had
seen
the
tears
of
suffering
in
edith
eyes
came
a
woman
who
told
him
of
having
sold
the
business
she
was
excited
by
the
message
she
had
to
deliver
and
walked
past
the
waiting
man
going
to
the
screen
door
to
stand
with
her
back
to
him
and
look
up
the
street
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
the
woman
looked
at
him
she
was
a
small
woman
with
two
gleaming
gold
teeth
and
with
glasses
on
her
nose
there
has
been
a
lovers
quarrel
here
she
told
herself
i
have
bought
the
store
she
said
aloud
she
told
me
to
tell
you
that
she
had
mcgregor
did
not
wait
for
more
but
hurried
past
the
woman
into
the
street
in
his
heart
was
a
feeling
of
dumb
aching
loss
on
an
impulse
he
turned
and
ran
back
standing
in
the
street
by
the
screen
door
he
shouted
hoarsely
where
did
she
go
he
demanded
the
woman
laughed
merrily
she
felt
that
she
was
getting
with
the
shop
a
flavour
of
romance
and
adventure
very
attractive
to
her
then
she
walked
to
the
door
and
smiled
through
the
screen
she
has
only
just
left
she
said
she
went
to
the
burlington
station
i
think
she
has
gone
west
i
heard
her
tell
the
man
about
her
trunk
she
has
been
around
here
for
two
days
since
i
bought
the
shop
i
think
she
has
been
waiting
for
you
to
come
you
did
not
come
and
now
she
has
gone
and
perhaps
you
wo
find
her
she
did
not
look
like
one
who
would
quarrel
with
a
the
woman
in
the
shop
laughed
softly
as
mcgregor
hurried
away
now
who
would
think
that
quiet
little
woman
would
have
such
a
lover
she
asked
herself
down
the
street
ran
mcgregor
and
raising
his
hand
stopped
a
passing
automobile
the
woman
saw
him
seated
in
the
automobile
talking
to
a
man
at
the
wheel
and
then
the
machine
turned
and
disappeared
up
the
street
at
a
pace
mcgregor
had
again
a
new
light
on
the
character
of
edith
carson
i
can
see
her
doing
it
he
told
himself
cheerfully
telling
margaret
that
it
did
matter
and
all
the
time
planning
this
in
the
back
of
her
head
here
all
of
these
years
she
has
been
leading
a
life
of
her
own
the
secret
longings
the
desires
and
the
old
human
hunger
for
love
and
happiness
and
expression
have
been
going
on
under
her
placid
exterior
as
they
have
under
my
mcgregor
thought
of
the
busy
days
behind
him
and
realised
with
shame
how
little
edith
had
seen
of
him
it
was
in
the
days
when
his
big
movement
of
the
marching
men
was
just
coming
into
the
light
and
on
the
night
before
he
had
been
in
a
conference
of
labour
men
who
had
wanted
him
to
make
a
public
demonstration
of
the
power
he
had
secretly
been
building
up
every
day
his
office
was
filled
with
newspaper
men
who
asked
questions
and
demanded
explanations
and
in
the
meantime
edith
had
been
selling
her
shop
to
that
woman
and
getting
ready
to
disappear
in
the
railroad
station
mcgregor
found
edith
sitting
in
a
corner
with
her
face
buried
in
the
crook
of
her
arm
gone
was
the
placid
exterior
her
shoulders
seemed
narrower
her
hand
hanging
over
the
back
of
the
seat
in
front
of
her
was
white
and
lifeless
mcgregor
said
nothing
but
snatched
up
the
brown
leather
bag
that
sat
beside
her
on
the
floor
and
taking
her
by
the
arm
led
her
up
a
flight
of
stone
steps
to
the
street
chapter
vii
in
the
ormsby
household
father
and
daughter
sat
in
the
darkness
on
the
veranda
after
laura
ormsby
encounter
with
mcgregor
there
had
been
another
talk
between
her
and
david
now
she
had
gone
on
a
visit
to
her
in
wisconsin
and
father
and
daughter
sat
together
to
his
wife
david
had
talked
pointedly
of
margaret
affair
it
is
not
a
matter
of
good
sense
he
had
said
one
can
not
pretend
there
is
a
prospect
of
happiness
in
such
an
affair
the
man
is
no
fool
and
may
some
day
be
a
big
man
but
it
will
not
be
the
kind
of
bigness
that
will
bring
either
happiness
or
contentment
to
a
woman
like
margaret
he
may
end
his
life
in
mcgregor
and
edith
walked
up
the
gravel
walk
and
stood
by
the
front
door
of
the
ormsby
house
from
the
darkness
on
the
veranda
came
the
hearty
voice
of
david
come
and
sit
out
here
he
said
mcgregor
stood
silently
waiting
edith
clung
to
his
arm
margaret
got
up
and
coming
forward
stood
looking
at
them
with
a
jump
at
her
heart
she
sensed
the
crisis
suggested
by
the
presence
of
these
two
people
her
voice
trembled
with
alarm
come
in
she
said
turning
and
leading
the
way
into
the
house
the
man
and
woman
followed
margaret
at
the
door
mcgregor
stopped
and
called
to
david
we
want
you
in
here
with
us
he
said
harshly
in
the
drawing
room
the
four
people
waited
the
great
chandelier
threw
its
light
down
upon
them
in
her
chair
edith
sat
and
looked
at
the
floor
i
made
a
mistake
said
mcgregor
i
been
going
on
and
on
making
a
he
turned
to
margaret
we
did
count
on
something
here
there
is
edith
she
is
what
we
edith
said
nothing
the
weary
stoop
stayed
in
her
shoulders
she
felt
that
if
mcgregor
had
brought
her
to
the
house
and
to
this
woman
he
loved
to
seal
their
parting
she
would
sit
quietly
until
that
was
over
and
then
go
on
to
the
loneliness
she
believed
must
be
her
portion
to
margaret
the
coming
of
the
man
and
woman
was
a
portent
of
evil
she
also
was
silent
expecting
a
shock
when
her
lover
spoke
she
also
looked
at
the
floor
to
herself
she
was
saying
he
is
going
to
take
himself
away
and
marry
this
other
woman
i
must
be
prepared
to
hear
him
say
in
the
doorway
stood
david
he
is
going
to
give
me
back
margaret
he
thought
and
his
heart
danced
with
happiness
mcgregor
walked
across
the
room
and
stood
looking
at
the
two
women
his
blue
eyes
were
cold
and
filled
with
intense
curiosity
concerning
them
and
himself
he
wanted
to
test
them
and
to
test
himself
if
i
am
now
i
shall
go
on
with
the
dream
he
thought
if
i
fail
in
this
i
shall
fail
in
turning
he
took
hold
of
the
sleeve
of
david
coat
and
pulled
him
across
the
room
so
that
the
two
men
stood
together
then
he
looked
hard
at
margaret
as
he
talked
to
her
he
continued
to
stand
thus
with
his
hand
on
her
father
arm
the
action
caught
david
fancy
and
a
thrill
of
admiration
ran
through
him
here

a
man
he
told
himself

ready
to

mcgregor

daughter
of

ploughmaker

to
speak

chalky
white
mcgregor
threw
up
his
hands

said

into
his
voice

the
harsh
quality
that
made
men

and
follow
him

beautiful
or
can
bear
more
beautiful
children
she
demanded
what
do
you
mean
by
beauty
anyway
i
deny
your
she
turned
to
mcgregor
look
she
cried
she
does
not
stand
the
pride
swept
over
the
woman
that
had
come
to
life
within
the
body
of
the
little
milliner
with
calm
eyes
she
stared
at
the
people
in
the
room
and
when
she
looked
again
toward
margaret
there
was
a
challenge
in
her
voice
beauty
has
to
endure
she
said
swiftly
it
has
to
be
daring
it
has
to
outlive
long
years
of
life
and
many
a
hard
look
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
challenged
the
daughter
of
wealth
i
had
the
courage
to
be
defeated
and
i
have
the
courage
to
take
what
i
want
she
said
have
you
that
courage
if
you
have
take
this
man
you
want
him
and
so
do
i
take
his
arm
and
walk
away
with
him
do
it
now
here
before
my
margaret
shook
her
head
her
body
trembled
and
her
eyes
looked
wildly
about
she
turned
to
david
ormsby
i
did
not
know
that
life
could
be
like
this
she
said
why
did
you
tell
me
she
is
right
i
am
a
light
came
into
mcgregor
eyes
and
he
turned
quickly
about
i
see
he
said
looking
sharply
at
edith
you
have
also
your
turning
again
he
looked
into
the
eyes
of
david
there
is
something
to
be
decided
here
it
is
perhaps
the
supreme
test
of
a
man
life
one
struggles
to
keep
a
thought
in
mind
to
be
impersonal
to
see
that
life
has
a
purpose
outside
his
own
purpose
you
have
perhaps
made
that
struggle
you
see
i
making
it
now
i
going
to
take
edith
and
go
back
to
at
the
door
mcgregor
stopped
and
put
out
his
hand
to
david
who
took
it
and
looked
at
the
big
lawyer
respectfully
i
glad
to
see
you
go
said
the
ploughmaker
briefly
i
glad
to
be
going
said
mcgregor
understanding
that
there
was
nothing
but
relief
and
honest
antagonism
in
the
voice
and
in
the
mind
of
david
ormsby
book
vi
chapter
i
the
marching
men
movement
was
never
a
thing
to
intellectualise
for
years
mcgregor
tried
to
get
it
under
way
by
talking
he
did
not
succeed
the
rhythm
and
swing
that
was
at
the
heart
of
the
movement
hung
fire
the
man
passed
through
long
periods
of
depression
and
had
to
drive
himself
forward
and
then
after
the
scene
with
margaret
and
edith
in
the
ormsby
house
came
action
there
was
a
man
named
mosby
about
whose
figure
the
action
for
a
time
revolved
he
was
bartender
for
neil
hunt
a
notorious
character
of
south
state
street
and
had
once
been
a
lieutenant
in
the
army
mosby
was
what
in
modern
society
is
called
a
rascal
after
west
point
and
a
few
years
at
some
isolated
army
post
he
began
to
drink
and
one
night
during
a
debauch
and
when
half
crazed
by
the
dullness
of
his
life
he
shot
a
private
through
the
shoulder
he
was
arrested
and
put
on
his
honour
not
to
escape
but
did
escape
for
years
he
drifted
about
the
world
a
haggard
cynical
figure
who
got
drunk
whenever
money
came
his
way
and
who
would
do
anything
to
break
the
monotony
of
existence
mosby
was
enthusiastic
about
the
marching
men
idea
he
saw
in
it
an
opportunity
to
worry
and
alarm
his
fellow
men
he
talked
a
union
of
bartenders
and
waiters
to
which
he
belonged
into
giving
the
idea
a
trial
and
in
the
morning
they
began
to
march
up
and
down
in
the
strip
of
parkland
that
faced
the
lake
at
the
edge
of
the
first
ward
keep
your
mouths
shut
commanded
mosby
we
can
worry
the
officials
of
this
town
like
the
devil
if
we
work
this
right
when
you
are
asked
questions
say
nothing
if
the
police
try
to
arrest
us
we
will
swear
we
are
only
doing
it
for
the
sake
of
mosby
plan
worked
within
a
week
crowds
began
to
gather
in
the
morning
to
watch
the
marching
men
and
the
police
started
to
make
inquiry
mosby
was
delighted
he
threw
up
his
job
as
bartender
and
recruited
a
motley
company
of
young
roughs
whom
he
induced
to
practise
the
march
step
during
the
afternoons
when
he
was
arrested
and
dragged
into
court
mcgregor
acted
as
his
lawyer
and
he
was
discharged
i
want
to
get
these
men
out
into
the
open
mosby
declared
looking
very
innocent
and
guileless
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
waiters
and
bartenders
get
pale
and
at
their
work
and
as
for
these
young
roughs
is
it
better
for
society
to
have
them
out
there
marching
about
than
idling
in
bar
rooms
and
planning
god
knows
what
mischief
a
grin
appeared
over
the
face
of
the
first
ward
mcgregor
and
mosby
organised
another
company
of
marchers
and
a
young
man
who
had
been
a
sergeant
in
a
company
of
regulars
was
induced
to
help
with
the
drilling
to
the
men
themselves
it
was
all
a
joke
a
game
that
appealed
to
the
mischievous
boy
in
them
everybody
was
curious
and
that
gave
the
thing
tang
they
grinned
as
they
marched
up
and
down
for
a
while
they
exchanged
gibes
with
the
spectators
but
mcgregor
put
a
stop
to
that
be
silent
he
said
going
about
among
the
men
during
the
rest
periods
that
the
best
thing
to
do
be
silent
and
attend
to
business
and
your
marching
will
be
ten
times
as
the
marching
men
movement
grew
a
young
jewish
newspaper
man
half
rascal
half
poet
wrote
a
story
for
one
of
the
sunday
papers
announcing
the
birth
of
the
republic
of
labour
the
story
was
illustrated
by
a
drawing
showing
mcgregor
leading
a
vast
horde
of
men
across
an
open
plain
toward
a
city
whose
tall
chimneys
belched
forth
clouds
of
smoke
beside
mcgregor
in
the
picture
and
arrayed
in
a
gaudy
uniform
was
mosby
the
officer
in
the
article
he
was
called
the
war
lord
of
the
secret
republic
growing
up
within
a
great
capitalistic
it
had
begun
to
take
form
the
movement
of
the
marching
men
rumours
began
to
run
here
and
there
there
was
a
question
in
men
eyes
slowly
at
first
it
began
to
rumble
through
their
minds
there
was
the
tap
of
feet
clicking
sharply
on
pavements
groups
formed
men
laughed
the
groups
disappeared
only
to
again
reappear
in
the
sun
before
factory
doors
men
stood
talking
half
understanding
beginning
to
sense
the
fact
that
there
was
something
big
in
the
wind
at
first
the
movement
did
not
get
anywhere
with
the
ranks
of
labour
there
would
be
a
meeting
perhaps
a
series
of
meetings
in
one
of
the
little
halls
where
labourers
gather
to
attend
to
the
affairs
of
their
unions
mcgregor
would
speak
his
voice
harsh
and
commanding
could
be
heard
in
the
streets
below
merchants
came
out
of
the
stores
and
stood
in
the
doorways
listening
young
fellows
who
smoked
cigarettes
stopped
looking
at
passing
girls
and
gathered
in
crowds
below
the
open
windows
the
slow
working
brain
of
labour
was
being
aroused
after
a
time
a
few
young
men
fellows
who
worked
at
the
saws
in
a
box
factory
and
others
who
ran
machines
in
a
factory
where
bicycles
were
made
volunteered
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
men
of
the
first
ward
on
summer
evenings
they
gathered
in
vacant
lots
and
marched
back
and
forth
looking
at
their
feet
and
laughing
mcgregor
insisted
upon
the
training
he
never
had
any
intention
of
letting
his
marching
men
movement
become
merely
a
disorganised
band
of
walkers
such
as
we
have
all
seen
in
many
a
labour
parade
he
meant
that
they
should
learn
to
march
rhythmically
swinging
along
like
veterans
he
was
determined
that
the
thresh
of
feet
should
come
finally
to
sing
a
great
song
carrying
the
message
of
a
powerful
brotherhood
into
the
hearts
and
brains
of
the
marchers
mcgregor
gave
all
of
his
time
to
the
movement
he
made
a
scant
living
by
the
practice
of
his
profession
but
gave
it
no
thought
the
murder
case
had
brought
him
other
cases
and
he
had
taken
a
partner
a
little
man
who
worked
out
the
details
of
what
cases
came
to
the
firm
and
collected
the
fees
half
of
which
he
gave
to
the
partner
who
was
intent
upon
something
else
day
after
day
week
after
week
month
after
month
mcgregor
went
up
and
down
the
city
talking
to
workers
learning
to
talk
striving
to
make
his
idea
understood
one
evening
in
september
he
stood
in
the
shadow
of
a
factory
wall
watching
a
group
of
men
who
marched
in
a
vacant
lot
the
movement
had
become
by
that
time
really
big
a
flame
burned
in
his
heart
at
the
thought
of
what
it
might
become
it
was
growing
dark
and
the
clouds
of
dust
raised
by
the
feet
of
the
men
swept
across
the
face
of
the
departing
sun
in
the
field
before
him
marched
some
two
hundred
men
the
largest
company
he
had
been
able
to
get
together
for
a
week
they
had
stayed
at
the
marching
evening
after
evening
and
were
beginning
a
little
to
understand
the
spirit
of
it
their
leader
on
the
field
a
tall
square
shouldered
man
had
once
been
a
captain
in
the
state
militia
and
now
worked
as
engineer
in
a
factory
where
soap
was
made
his
commands
rang
out
sharp
and
crisp
on
the
evening
air
fours
right
into
line
he
cried
the
words
were
barked
forth
the
men
straightened
their
shoulders
and
swung
out
vigorously
they
had
begun
to
enjoy
the
marching
in
the
shadow
of
the
factory
wall
mcgregor
moved
uneasily
about
he
felt
that
this
was
the
beginning
the
real
birth
of
his
movement
that
these
men
had
really
come
out
of
the
ranks
of
labour
and
that
in
the
breasts
of
the
marching
figures
there
in
the
open
space
understanding
was
growing
he
muttered
and
walked
back
and
forth
a
young
man
a
reporter
on
one
of
the
city
great
daily
papers
leaped
from
a
passing
street
car
and
came
to
stand
near
him
what
up
here
what
this
going
on
what
it
all
about
you
better
tell
me
he
said
in
the
dim
light
mcgregor
raised
his
fists
above
his
head
and
talked
aloud
it
creeping
in
among
them
he
said
the
thing
that
ca
be
put
into
words
is
getting
itself
expressed
something
is
being
done
here
in
this
field
a
new
force
is
coming
into
the
half
beside
himself
mcgregor
ran
up
and
down
swinging
his
arms
again
turning
to
the
reporter
who
stood
by
a
factory
wall
a
rather
dandified
figure
he
was
with
a
tiny
moustache
he
shouted
do
you
see
he
cried
his
voice
was
harsh
see
how
they
march
they
are
finding
out
what
i
mean
they
have
caught
the
spirit
of
it
mcgregor
began
to
explain
he
talked
hurriedly
his
words
coming
forth
in
short
broken
sentences
for
ages
there
has
been
talk
of
brotherhood
always
men
have
babbled
of
brotherhood
the
words
have
meant
nothing
the
words
and
the
talking
have
but
bred
a
race
the
jaws
of
men
wabble
about
but
the
legs
of
these
men
do
not
he
again
walked
up
and
down
dragging
the
man
along
the
deepening
shadow
of
the
factory
wall
you
see
it
begins
now
in
this
field
it
begins
the
legs
and
the
feet
of
men
hundreds
of
legs
and
feet
make
a
kind
of
music
presently
there
will
be
thousands
hundreds
of
thousands
for
a
time
men
will
cease
to
be
individuals
they
will
become
a
mass
a
moving
mass
they
will
not
put
their
thoughts
into
words
but
nevertheless
there
will
be
a
thought
growing
up
in
them
they
will
of
a
sudden
begin
to
realise
that
they
are
a
part
of
something
vast
and
mighty
a
thing
that
moves
that
is
seeking
new
expression
they
have
been
told
of
the
power
of
labour
but
now
you
see
they
will
become
the
power
of
swept
along
by
his
own
words
and
perhaps
by
something
rhythmical
in
the
moving
mass
of
men
mcgregor
became
feverishly
anxious
that
the
dapper
young
man
should
understand
do
you
remember
when
you
were
a
boy
some
man
who
had
been
a
soldier
telling
you
that
the
men
who
marched
had
to
break
step
and
go
in
a
disorderly
mob
across
a
bridge
because
their
orderly
stride
would
have
shaken
the
bridge
to
pieces
a
shiver
ran
over
the
body
of
the
young
man
in
his
off
hours
he
was
a
writer
of
plays
and
stories
and
his
trained
dramatic
sense
caught
quickly
the
import
of
mcgregor
words
into
his
mind
came
a
scene
on
a
village
street
of
his
own
place
in
ohio
in
fancy
he
saw
the
village
fife
and
drum
corps
marching
past
his
mind
recalled
the
swing
and
the
cadence
of
the
tune
and
again
as
when
he
was
a
boy
his
legs
ached
to
run
out
among
the
men
and
go
marching
away
filled
with
excitement
he
began
also
to
talk
i
see
he
cried
you
think
there
is
a
thought
in
that
a
big
thought
that
men
have
not
understood
on
the
field
the
men
becoming
bolder
as
they
became
less
came
sweeping
by
their
bodies
falling
into
a
long
swinging
stride
the
young
man
pondered
i
see
i
see
every
one
who
stood
watching
as
i
did
when
the
fife
and
drum
corps
went
past
felt
what
i
felt
they
were
hiding
behind
a
mask
their
legs
also
tingled
and
the
same
wild
militant
thumping
went
on
in
their
hearts
you
have
found
that
out
eh
you
mean
to
lead
labour
that
way
with
open
mouth
the
young
man
stared
at
the
field
and
at
the
moving
mass
of
men
he
became
oratorical
in
his
thoughts
here
is
a
big
man
he
muttered
here
is
a
napoleon
a
caesar
of
labour
come
to
chicago
he
is
not
like
the
little
leaders
his
mind
is
not
sicklied
over
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
he
does
not
think
that
the
big
natural
impulses
of
men
are
foolish
and
absurd
he
has
got
hold
of
something
here
that
will
work
the
world
had
better
watch
this
half
beside
himself
he
walked
up
and
down
at
the
edge
of
the
field
his
body
trembling
out
of
the
ranks
of
the
marching
men
came
a
workman
in
the
field
words
arose
a
petulant
quality
came
into
the
voice
of
the
captain
who
gave
commands
the
newspaper
man
listened
anxiously
that
what
will
spoil
everything
the
men
will
begin
to
lose
heart
and
will
quit
he
thought
leaning
forward
and
waiting
i
worked
all
day
and
i
ca
march
up
and
down
here
all
night
complained
the
voice
of
the
workman
past
the
shoulder
of
the
young
man
went
a
shadow
before
his
eyes
on
the
field
fronting
the
waiting
ranks
of
men
stood
mcgregor
his
fist
shot
out
and
the
complaining
workman
crumpled
to
the
ground
this
is
no
time
for
words
said
the
harsh
voice
get
back
in
there
this
is
not
a
game
it
the
beginning
of
men
realisation
of
themselves
get
in
there
and
say
nothing
if
you
ca
march
with
us
get
out
the
movement
we
have
started
can
pay
no
attention
to
among
the
ranks
of
men
a
cheer
arose
by
the
factory
wall
the
excited
newspaper
man
danced
up
and
down
at
a
word
of
command
from
the
captain
the
line
of
marching
men
again
swept
down
the
field
and
he
watched
them
with
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
it
going
to
work
he
cried

to
work

john
van
moore
a
young
chicago
advertising
man
went
one
afternoon
to
the
offices
of
the
wheelright
bicycle
company
the
company
had
both
its
factory
and
offices
far
out
on
the
west
side
the
factory
was
a
huge
brick
affair
fronted
by
a
broad
cement
sidewalk
and
a
narrow
green
lawn
spotted
with
flower
beds
the
building
used
for
offices
was
smaller
and
had
a
veranda
facing
the
street
up
the
sides
of
the
office
building
vines
grew
like
the
reporter
who
had
watched
the
marching
men
in
the
field
by
the
factory
wall
john
van
moore
was
a
dapper
young
man
with
a
moustache
in
his
leisure
hours
he
played
a
clarinet
it
gives
a
man
something
to
cling
to
he
explained
to
his
friends
one
sees
life
going
past
and
feels
that
he
is
not
a
mere
drifting
log
in
the
stream
of
things
although
as
a
musician
i
amount
to
nothing
it
at
least
makes
me
among
the
men
in
the
advertising
office
where
he
worked
van
moore
was
known
as
something
of
a
fool
redeemed
by
his
ability
to
string
words
together
he
wore
a
heavy
black
braided
watch
chain
and
carried
a
cane
and
he
had
a
wife
who
after
marriage
had
studied
medicine
and
with
whom
he
did
not
live
sometimes
on
a
saturday
evening
the
two
met
at
some
restaurant
and
sat
for
hours
drinking
and
laughing
when
the
wife
had
gone
to
her
own
place
the
advertising
man
continued
the
fun
going
from
saloon
to
saloon
and
making
long
speeches
setting
forth
his
philosophy
of
life
i
am
an
individualist
he
declared
strutting
up
and
down
and
swinging
the
cane
about
i
am
a
dabbler
an
experimenter
if
you
will
before
i
die
it
is
my
dream
that
i
will
discover
a
new
quality
in
for
the
bicycle
company
the
advertising
man
was
to
write
a
booklet
telling
in
romantic
and
readable
form
the
history
of
the
company
when
finished
the
booklet
would
be
sent
out
to
those
who
had
answered
advertisements
put
into
magazines
and
newspapers
the
company
had
a
process
of
manufacture
peculiar
to
wheelright
bicycles
and
in
the
booklet
this
was
to
be
much
emphasised
the
manufacturing
process
in
regard
to
which
john
van
moore
was
to
wax
eloquent
had
been
conceived
in
the
brain
of
a
workman
and
was
responsible
for
the
company
success
now
the
workman
was
dead
and
the
president
of
the
company
had
decided
that
he
would
take
credit
for
the
idea
he
had
thought
a
good
deal
of
the
matter
and
had
decided
that
in
truth
the
notion
must
have
been
more
than
a
little
his
own
it
must
have
been
so
he
told
himself
otherwise
it
would
not
have
worked
out
so
in
the
offices
of
the
bicycle
company
the
president
a
grey
gross
man
with
tiny
eyes
walked
up
and
down
a
long
room
heavily
carpeted
in
reply
to
questions
asked
by
the
advertising
man
who
sat
at
a
table
with
a
pad
of
paper
before
him
he
raised
himself
on
his
toes
put
a
thumb
in
the
armhole
of
his
vest
and
told
a
long
rambling
tale
of
which
he
was
the
hero
the
tale
concerned
a
purely
imaginary
young
workman
who
spent
all
of
the
earlier
years
of
his
life
labouring
terribly
at
evening
he
ran
quickly
from
the
shop
where
he
was
employed
and
going
without
sleep
toiled
for
long
hours
in
a
little
garret
when
the
workman
had
discovered
the
secret
that
made
successful
the
wheelright
bicycle
he
opened
a
shop
and
began
to
reap
the
reward
of
his
efforts
that
was
me
i
was
that
fellow
cried
the
fat
man
who
in
reality
had
bought
his
interest
in
the
bicycle
company
after
the
age
of
forty
tapping
himself
on
the
breast
he
paused
as
though
overcome
with
feeling
tears
came
into
his
eyes
the
young
workman
had
become
a
reality
to
him
all
day
i
ran
about
the
little
shop
crying
quality
i
do
that
now
it
is
a
fetish
with
me
i
do
not
make
bicycles
for
money
but
because
i
am
a
workman
with
pride
in
my
work
you
may
put
that
in
the
book
you
may
quote
me
as
saying
that
a
big
point
should
be
made
of
my
pride
in
my
the
advertising
man
nodded
his
head
and
scribbled
upon
the
pad
of
paper
almost
he
could
have
written
the
story
without
the
visit
to
the
factory
when
the
fat
man
was
not
looking
he
turned
his
face
to
one
side
and
listened
attentively
with
a
whole
heart
he
wished
the
president
would
go
away
and
leave
him
alone
to
wander
in
the
factory
on
the
evening
before
john
van
moore
had
taken
part
in
an
adventure
with
a
companion
a
fellow
who
drew
cartoons
for
the
daily
papers
he
had
gone
into
a
saloon
and
there
had
met
another
man
of
the
newspapers
in
the
saloon
the
three
men
had
sat
until
late
into
the
night
drinking
and
talking
the
second
newspaper
man
that
same
dapper
fellow
who
had
watched
the
marchers
by
the
factory
wall
had
told
over
and
over
the
story
of
mcgregor
and
his
marchers
i
tell
you
there
is
something
growing
up
here
he
had
said
i
have
seen
this
mcgregor
and
i
know
you
may
believe
me
or
not
but
the
fact
is
that
he
has
found
out
something
there
is
an
element
in
men
that
up
to
now
has
not
been
understood
there
is
a
thought
hidden
away
within
the
breast
of
labour
a
big
unspoken
thought
it
is
a
part
of
men
bodies
as
well
as
their
minds
suppose
this
fellow
has
figured
that
out
and
understands
it
eh
becoming
more
and
more
excited
as
he
continued
to
drink
the
newspaper
man
had
been
half
wild
in
his
conjectures
as
to
what
was
to
happen
in
the
world
thumping
with
his
fist
upon
a
table
wet
with
beer
he
had
addressed
the
writer
of
advertisements
there
are
things
that
animals
know
that
have
not
been
understood
by
men
he
cried
consider
the
bees
have
you
thought
that
man
has
not
tried
to
work
out
a
collective
intellect
why
should
man
not
try
to
work
that
out
the
newspaper
man
voice
became
low
and
tense
when
you
go
into
a
factory
i
want
you
to
keep
your
eyes
and
your
ears
open
he
said
go
into
one
of
the
great
rooms
where
many
men
are
at
work
stand
perfectly
still
do
try
to
think
jumping
out
of
his
seat
the
excited
man
had
walked
up
and
down
before
his
companions
a
group
of
men
standing
before
the
bar
listened
their
glasses
held
half
way
to
their
lips
i
tell
you
there
is
already
a
song
of
labour
it
has
not
got
itself
expressed
and
understood
but
it
is
in
every
shop
in
every
field
where
men
work
in
a
dim
way
the
men
who
work
are
conscious
of
the
song
although
if
you
talk
of
the
matter
they
only
laugh
the
song
is
low
harsh
rhythmical
i
tell
you
it
comes
out
of
the
very
soul
of
labour
it
is
akin
to
the
thing
that
artists
understand
and
that
is
called
form
this
mcgregor
understands
something
of
that
he
is
the
first
leader
of
labour
that
has
understood
the
world
shall
hear
from
him
one
of
these
days
the
world
shall
ring
with
his
in
the
bicycle
factory
john
van
moore
looked
at
the
pad
of
paper
before
him
and
thought
of
the
words
of
the
half
drunken
man
in
the
saloon
in
the
great
shop
at
his
back
there
was
the
steady
grinding
roar
of
many
machines
the
fat
man
hypnotised
by
his
own
words
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
telling
of
the
hardship
that
had
once
confronted
the
imaginary
young
workman
and
above
which
he
had
risen
triumphant
we
hear
much
of
the
power
of
labour
but
there
has
been
a
mistake
made
he
said
such
men
as
myself
we
are
the
power
do
you
see
we
have
come
out
of
the
mass
we
stand
stopping
before
the
advertising
man
and
looking
down
the
fat
man
winked
you
do
not
need
to
say
that
in
the
book
there
is
no
need
of
quoting
me
there
our
bicycles
are
being
bought
by
workingmen
and
it
would
be
foolish
to
offend
them
but
what
i
say
is
nevertheless
true
do
not
such
men
as
i
with
our
cunning
brains
and
our
power
of
patience
build
these
great
modern
organisations
the
fat
man
waved
his
arm
toward
the
shops
from
which
the
roar
of
machinery
came
the
advertising
man
absentmindedly
nodded
his
head
he
was
trying
to
hear
the
song
of
labour
talked
of
by
the
drunken
man
it
was
quitting
time
and
there
was
the
sound
of
many
feet
moving
about
the
floor
of
the
factory
the
roar
of
the
machinery
stopped
again
the
fat
man
walked
up
and
down
talking
of
the
career
of
the
labourer
who
had
come
forth
from
the
ranks
of
labour
from
the
factory
the
men
began
filing
out
into
the
open
there
was
the
sound
of
feet
scuffling
along
the
wide
cement
sidewalk
past
the
flowerbeds
of
a
sudden
the
fat
man
stopped
the
advertising
man
sat
with
pencil
suspended
above
the
paper
from
the
walk
below
sharp
commands
rang
out
again
the
sound
of
men
moving
about
came
in
through
the
windows
the
president
of
the
bicycle
company
and
the
advertising
man
ran
to
the
window
there
on
the
cement
sidewalk
stood
the
men
of
the
company
formed
into
columns
of
fours
and
separated
into
companies
at
the
head
of
each
company
stood
a
captain
the
captains
swung
the
men
about
forward
march
they
shouted
the
fat
man
stood
with
his
mouth
open
and
looked
at
the
men
going
on
down
there
what
do
you
mean
quit
that
he
bawled
a
derisive
laugh
floated
up
through
the
window
attention
forward
guide
right
shouted
a
captain
the
men
went
swinging
down
the
broad
cement
sidewalk
past
the
window
and
the
advertising
man
in
their
faces
was
something
determined
and
grim
a
sickly
smile
flitted
across
the
face
of
the
man
and
then
faded
the
advertising
man
without
knowing
just
what
was
going
on
felt
that
the
older
man
was
afraid
he
sensed
the
terror
in
his
face
in
his
heart
he
was
glad
to
see
it
the
manufacturer
began
to
talk
excitedly
now
what
this
he
demanded
what
going
on
what
kind
of
a
volcano
are
we
men
of
affairs
walking
over
have
we
had
enough
trouble
with
labour
what
are
they
doing
now
again
he
walked
up
and
down
past
the
table
where
the
advertising
man
sat
looking
at
him
we
let
the
book
go
he
said
come
come
any
time
i
want
to
look
into
this
i
want
to
find
out
what
going
leaving
the
office
of
the
bicycle
company
john
van
moore
ran
along
the
street
past
stores
and
houses
he
did
not
try
to
follow
the
marching
men
but
ran
forward
blindly
filled
with
excitement
he
remembered
the
words
of
the
newspaper
man
about
the
song
of
labour
and
was
drunk
with
the
thought
that
he
had
caught
the
swing
of
it
a
hundred
times
he
had
seen
men
pouring
out
of
factory
doors
at
the
end
of
the
day
always
before
they
had
been
just
a
mass
of
individuals
each
had
been
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
and
each
man
had
shuffled
off
into
his
own
street
and
had
been
lost
in
the
dim
alleyways
between
the
tall
grimy
buildings
now
all
of
this
was
changed
the
men
did
not
shuffle
off
alone
but
marched
along
the
street
shoulder
to
shoulder
a
lump
came
also
into
the
throat
of
this
man
and
he
like
that
other
by
the
factory
wall
began
to
say
words
the
song
of
labour
is
here
it
has
begun
to
get
itself
sung
he
cried
john
van
moore
was
beside
himself
the
face
of
the
fat
man
pale
with
terror
came
back
into
his
mind
on
the
sidewalk
before
a
grocery
store
he
stopped
and
shouted
with
delight
then
he
began
dancing
wildly
about
startling
a
group
of
children
who
with
fingers
in
their
mouths
stood
with
staring
eyes
watching
chapter
iii
all
through
the
early
months
of
that
year
in
chicago
rumours
of
a
new
and
not
understandable
movement
among
labourers
ran
about
among
men
of
affairs
in
a
way
the
labourers
understood
the
undercurrent
of
terror
their
marching
together
had
inspired
and
like
the
advertising
man
dancing
on
the
sidewalk
before
the
grocery
were
made
happy
by
it
grim
satisfaction
dwelt
in
their
hearts
remembering
their
boyhoods
and
the
creeping
terror
that
invaded
their
fathers
houses
in
times
of
depression
they
were
glad
to
spread
terror
among
the
homes
of
the
rich
and
the
for
years
they
had
been
going
through
life
blindly
striving
to
forget
age
and
poverty
now
they
felt
that
life
had
a
purpose
that
they
were
marching
toward
some
end
when
in
the
past
they
had
been
told
that
power
dwelt
in
them
they
had
not
believed
he
is
not
to
be
trusted
thought
the
man
at
the
machine
looking
at
the
man
at
work
at
the
next
machine
i
have
heard
him
talk
and
at
bottom
he
is
a
now
the
man
at
the
machine
did
not
think
of
his
brother
at
the
next
machine
in
his
dreams
at
night
he
was
beginning
to
have
a
new
vision
power
had
breathed
its
message
into
his
brain
of
a
sudden
he
saw
himself
as
a
part
of
a
giant
walking
in
the
world
i
am
like
a
drop
of
blood
running
through
the
veins
of
labour
he
whispered
to
himself
in
my
own
way
i
am
adding
strength
to
the
heart
and
the
brain
of
labour
i
have
become
a
part
of
this
thing
that
has
begun
to
move
i
will
not
talk
but
will
wait
if
this
marching
is
the
thing
then
i
will
march
though
i
am
weary
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
shall
not
stop
me
many
times
i
have
been
weary
and
was
alone
now
i
am
a
part
of
something
vast
this
i
know
that
a
consciousness
of
power
has
crept
into
my
brain
and
although
i
be
persecuted
i
shall
not
surrender
what
i
have
in
the
offices
of
the
plough
trust
a
meeting
of
men
of
affairs
was
called
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
was
to
discuss
the
movement
going
on
among
the
workers
at
the
plough
works
it
had
broken
out
no
more
at
evening
did
the
men
shuffle
along
like
a
disorderly
mob
but
marched
in
companies
along
the
street
that
ran
by
the
factory
door
at
the
meeting
david
ormsby
had
been
as
always
quiet
and
a
halo
of
kindly
intent
hung
over
him
and
when
a
banker
one
of
the
directors
of
the
company
had
finished
a
speech
he
arose
and
walked
up
and
down
his
hands
thrust
into
his
trousers
pockets
the
banker
was
a
fat
man
with
thin
brown
hair
and
delicate
hands
as
he
talked
he
held
a
pair
of
yellow
gloves
and
beat
with
them
on
a
long
table
at
the
centre
of
the
room
the
soft
thump
of
the
gloves
upon
the
table
made
a
chorus
to
the
things
he
had
to
say
david
motioned
for
him
to
be
seated
i
will
myself
go
to
see
this
mcgregor
he
said
walking
across
the
room
and
putting
an
arm
about
the
shoulder
of
the
banker
perhaps
there
is
as
you
say
a
new
and
terrible
danger
here
but
i
do
not
think
so
for
thousands
no
doubt
for
millions
of
years
the
world
has
gone
on
its
way
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
to
be
stopped
now
it
has
been
my
fortune
to
see
and
to
know
this
mcgregor
added
david
smiling
at
the
others
in
the
room
he
is
a
man
and
not
a
joshua
to
make
the
sun
stand
in
the
office
in
van
buren
street
david
the
grey
and
confident
stood
before
the
desk
at
which
sat
mcgregor
we
will
get
out
of
here
if
you
do
not
mind
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
you
and
i
would
not
like
being
interrupted
i
have
a
fancy
that
we
talk
out
of
the
two
men
went
in
a
street
car
to
jackson
park
and
forgetting
to
dine
walked
for
an
hour
along
the
paths
under
the
trees
the
wind
from
the
lake
had
chilled
the
air
and
the
park
was
deserted
they
went
to
stand
on
a
pier
that
ran
out
into
the
lake
on
the
pier
david
tried
to
begin
the
talk
that
was
the
object
of
their
being
together
but
felt
that
the
wind
and
the
water
that
beat
against
the
piling
of
the
pier
made
talk
too
difficult
although
he
could
not
have
told
why
he
was
relieved
by
the
necessity
of
delay
into
the
park
they
went
again
and
found
a
seat
upon
a
bench
facing
a
lagoon
in
the
presence
of
the
silent
mcgregor
david
felt
suddenly
embarrassed
and
awkward
by
what
right
do
i
question
him
he
asked
himself
and
in
his
mind
could
find
no
answer
a
half
dozen
times
he
started
to
say
what
he
had
come
to
say
but
stopped
and
his
talk
ran
off
into
trivialities
there
are
men
in
the
world
you
have
not
taken
into
consideration
he
said
finally
forcing
himself
to
begin
with
a
laugh
he
went
on
relieved
that
the
silence
had
been
broken
you
see
the
very
inner
secret
of
strong
men
has
been
missed
by
you
and
david
ormsby
looked
sharply
at
mcgregor
i
do
not
believe
that
you
believe
we
are
after
money
we
men
of
affairs
i
trust
you
see
beyond
that
we
have
our
purpose
and
we
keep
to
our
purpose
quietly
and
again
david
looked
at
the
silent
figure
sitting
in
the
dim
light
and
again
his
mind
ran
out
striving
to
penetrate
the
silence
i
am
not
a
fool
and
perhaps
i
know
that
the
movement
you
have
started
among
the
workers
is
something
new
there
is
power
in
it
as
in
all
great
ideas
perhaps
i
think
there
is
power
in
you
why
else
should
i
be
here
again
david
laughed
uncertainly
in
a
way
i
am
in
sympathy
with
you
he
said
although
all
through
my
life
i
have
served
money
i
have
not
been
owned
by
it
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
men
like
me
have
not
something
beyond
money
in
the
old
plough
maker
looked
away
over
mcgregor
shoulder
to
where
the
leaves
of
the
trees
shook
in
the
wind
from
the
lake
there
have
been
men
and
great
leaders
who
have
understood
the
silent
competent
servants
of
wealth
he
said
half
petulantly
i
want
you
to
understand
these
men
i
should
like
to
see
you
become
such
a
one
yourself
not
for
the
wealth
it
would
bring
but
because
in
the
end
you
would
thus
serve
all
men
you
would
get
at
truth
thus
the
power
that
is
in
you
would
be
conserved
and
used
more
to
be
sure
history
has
taken
little
or
no
account
of
the
men
of
whom
i
speak
they
have
passed
through
life
unnoticed
doing
great
work
the
plough
maker
paused
although
mcgregor
had
said
nothing
the
older
man
felt
that
the
interview
was
not
going
as
it
should
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
have
in
mind
what
in
the
end
you
hope
to
gain
for
yourself
or
for
these
men
he
said
somewhat
sharply
there
is
after
all
no
point
to
our
beating
about
the
mcgregor
said
nothing
arising
from
the
bench
he
began
again
to
walk
along
the
path
with
ormsby
at
his
side
the
really
strong
men
of
the
world
have
had
no
place
in
history
declared
ormsby
bitterly
they
have
not
asked
that
they
were
in
rome
and
in
germany
in
the
time
of
martin
luther
but
nothing
is
said
of
them
although
they
do
not
mind
the
silence
of
history
they
would
like
other
strong
men
to
understand
the
march
of
the
world
is
a
greater
thing
than
the
dust
raised
by
the
heels
of
some
few
workers
walking
through
the
streets
and
these
men
are
responsible
for
the
march
of
the
world
you
are
making
a
mistake
i
invite
you
to
become
one
of
us
if
you
plan
to
upset
things
you
may
get
yourself
into
history
but
you
will
not
really
count
what
you
are
trying
to
do
will
not
work
you
will
come
to
a
bad
when
the
two
men
emerged
from
the
park
the
older
man
had
again
the
feeling
that
the
interview
had
not
been
a
success
he
was
sorry
the
evening
he
felt
had
marked
for
him
a
failure
and
he
was
not
accustomed
to
failures
there
is
a
wall
here
that
i
can
not
penetrate
he
thought
along
the
front
of
the
park
beneath
a
grove
of
trees
they
walked
in
silence
mcgregor
seemed
not
to
have
heard
the
words
addressed
to
him
when
they
came
to
where
a
long
row
of
vacant
lots
faced
the
park
he
stopped
and
stood
leaning
against
a
tree
to
look
away
into
the
park
lost
in
thought
david
ormsby
also
became
silent
he
thought
of
his
youth
in
the
little
village
plough
factory
of
his
efforts
to
get
on
in
the
world
of
the
long
evenings
spent
reading
books
and
trying
to
understand
the
movements
of
men
is
there
an
element
in
nature
and
in
youth
that
we
do
not
understand
or
that
we
lose
sight
of
he
asked
are
the
efforts
of
the
patient
workers
of
the
world
always
to
be
abortive
can
some
new
phase
of
life
arise
suddenly
upsetting
all
of
our
plans
do
you
can
you
think
of
men
like
me
as
but
part
of
a
vast
whole
do
you
deny
to
us
individuality
the
right
to
stand
forth
the
right
to
work
things
out
and
to
control
the
ploughmaker
looked
at
the
huge
figure
standing
beside
the
tree
again
he
was
irritated
and
kept
lighting
cigars
which
after
two
or
three
puffs
he
threw
away
in
the
bushes
at
the
back
of
the
bench
insects
began
to
sing
the
wind
coming
now
in
gentle
gusts
swayed
slowly
the
branches
of
the
trees
overhead
is
there
an
eternal
youth
in
the
world
a
state
out
of
which
men
pass
unknowingly
a
youth
that
forever
destroys
tearing
down
what
has
been
built
he
asked
are
the
mature
lives
of
strong
men
of
so
little
account
have
you
like
the
empty
fields
that
bask
in
the
sun
in
the
summer
the
right
to
remain
silent
in
the
presence
of
men
who
have
had
thoughts
and
have
tried
to
put
their
thoughts
into
deeds
still
saying
nothing
mcgregor
pointed
with
his
finger
along
the
road
that
faced
the
park
from
a
side
street
a
body
of
men
swung
about
a
corner
coming
with
long
strides
toward
the
two
as
they
passed
beneath
a
street
lamp
that
swung
gently
in
the
wind
their
faces
flashing
in
and
out
of
the
light
seemed
to
be
mocking
david
ormsby
for
a
moment
anger
burned
in
him
and
then
something
perhaps
the
rhythm
of
the
moving
mass
of
men
brought
a
gentler
mood
the
men
swinging
past
turned
another
corner
and
disappeared
beneath
the
structure
of
an
elevated
railroad
the
ploughmaker
walked
away
from
mcgregor
something
in
the
interview
terminating
thus
with
the
presence
of
the
marching
figures
had
he
felt
unmanned
him
after
all
there
is
youth
and
the
hope
of
youth
what
he
has
in
mind
may
work
he
thought
as
he
climbed
aboard
a
street
car
in
the
car
david
put
his
head
out
at
the
window
and
looked
at
the
long
line
of
apartment
buildings
that
lined
the
streets
he
thought
again
of
his
own
youth
and
of
the
evenings
in
the
wisconsin
village
when
himself
a
youth
he
went
with
other
young
men
singing
and
marching
in
the
moonlight
in
a
vacant
lot
he
again
saw
a
body
of
the
marching
men
moving
back
and
forth
and
responding
quickly
to
the
commands
given
by
a
slender
young
man
who
stood
on
the
sidewalk
beneath
a
street
lamp
and
held
a
stick
in
his
hand
in
the
car
the
man
of
affairs
put
his
head
down
upon
the
back
of
the
seat
in
front
half
unconscious
of
his
own
thoughts
his
mind
began
to
dwell
upon
the
figure
of
his
daughter
had
i
been
margaret
i
should
not
have
let
him
go
no
matter
what
the
cost
i
should
have
clung
to
the
man
he
muttered
chapter
iv
it
is
difficult
not
to
be
of
two
minds
about
the
manifestation
now
called
and
perhaps
rightly
the
madness
of
the
marching
in
one
mood
it
comes
back
to
the
mind
as
something
unspeakably
big
and
inspiring
we
go
each
of
us
through
the
treadmill
of
our
lives
caught
and
caged
like
little
animals
in
some
vast
menagerie
in
turn
we
love
marry
breed
children
have
our
moments
of
blind
futile
passion
and
then
something
happens
all
unconsciously
a
change
creeps
over
us
youth
passes
we
become
shrewd
careful
submerged
in
little
things
life
art
great
passions
dreams
all
of
these
pass
under
the
night
sky
the
suburbanite
stands
in
the
moonlight
he
is
hoeing
his
radishes
and
worrying
because
the
laundry
has
torn
one
of
his
white
collars
the
railroad
is
to
put
on
an
extra
morning
train
he
remembers
that
fact
heard
at
the
store
for
him
the
night
becomes
more
beautiful
for
ten
minutes
longer
he
can
stay
with
the
radishes
each
morning
there
is
much
of
man
life
in
the
figure
of
the
suburbanite
standing
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
in
the
midst
of
his
radishes
and
so
about
the
business
of
our
lives
we
go
and
then
of
a
sudden
there
comes
again
the
feeling
that
crept
over
us
all
in
the
year
of
the
marching
men
in
a
moment
we
are
again
a
part
of
the
moving
mass
the
old
religious
exaltation
strange
emanation
from
the
man
mcgregor
returns
in
fancy
we
feel
the
earth
tremble
under
the
feet
of
the
men
the
marchers
with
a
conscious
straining
of
the
mind
we
strive
to
grasp
the
processes
of
the
mind
of
the
leader
during
that
year
when
men
sensed
his
meaning
when
they
saw
as
he
saw
the
workers
saw
them
massed
and
moving
through
the
world
my
own
mind
striving
feebly
to
follow
that
greater
and
simpler
mind
gropes
about
i
remember
sharply
the
words
of
a
writer
who
said
that
men
make
their
own
gods
and
realise
that
i
myself
saw
something
of
the
birth
of
such
a
god
for
he
was
near
to
being
a
god
then
our
mcgregor
the
thing
he
did
rumbles
in
the
minds
of
men
yet
his
long
shadow
will
fall
across
men
thoughts
for
ages
the
tantalising
effort
to
understand
his
meaning
will
tempt
us
always
into
endless
speculation
only
last
week
i
met
a
man
he
was
a
steward
in
a
club
and
lingered
talking
to
me
by
a
cigar
case
in
an
empty
who
suddenly
turned
away
to
conceal
from
me
two
large
tears
that
had
jumped
into
his
eyes
because
of
a
kind
of
tenderness
in
my
voice
at
the
mention
of
the
marching
men
another
mood
comes
it
may
be
the
right
mood
i
see
sparrows
jumping
about
in
an
ordinary
roadway
as
i
walk
to
my
office
from
the
maple
trees
the
little
winged
seeds
come
fluttering
down
before
my
eyes
a
boy
goes
past
sitting
in
a
grocery
wagon
and
a
rather
bony
horse
as
i
walk
i
overtake
two
workmen
shuffling
along
they
remind
me
of
those
other
workers
and
i
say
to
myself
that
thus
men
have
always
shuffled
that
never
did
they
swing
forward
into
that
rhythmical
march
of
the
workers
you
were
drunk
with
youth
and
a
kind
of
world
madness
says
my
normal
self
as
i
go
forward
again
striving
to
think
things
out
chicago
is
still
here
chicago
after
mcgregor
and
the
marching
men
the
elevated
trains
still
clatter
over
the
frogs
at
the
turning
into
wabash
avenue
the
surface
cars
clang
their
bells
the
crowds
pour
up
in
the
morning
from
the
runway
leading
to
the
illinois
central
trains
life
goes
on
and
men
in
their
offices
sit
in
their
chairs
and
say
that
the
thing
that
happened
was
abortive
a
brain
storm
a
wild
outbreak
of
the
rebellious
the
disorderly
and
the
hunger
in
the
minds
of
men
what
begging
of
the
question
the
very
soul
of
the
marching
men
was
a
sense
of
order
that
was
the
message
of
it
the
thing
that
the
world
has
not
come
up
to
yet
men
have
not
learned
that
we
must
come
to
understand
the
impulse
toward
order
have
that
burned
into
our
consciousness
before
we
move
on
to
other
things
there
is
in
us
this
madness
for
individual
expression
for
each
of
us
the
little
moment
of
running
forward
and
lifting
our
thin
childish
voices
in
the
midst
of
the
great
silence
we
have
not
learned
that
out
of
us
all
walking
shoulder
to
shoulder
there
might
arise
a
greater
voice
something
to
make
the
waters
of
the
very
seas
to
tremble
mcgregor
knew
he
had
a
mind
not
sick
with
much
thinking
of
trifles
when
he
had
a
great
idea
he
thought
it
would
work
and
he
meant
to
see
that
it
did
work
mightily
was
he
equipped
i
have
seen
the
man
in
halls
talking
his
huge
body
swaying
back
and
forth
his
great
fists
in
the
air
his
voice
harsh
persistent
insistent
with
something
of
the
quality
of
the
drums
in
it
beating
down
into
the
upturned
faces
of
the
men
crowded
into
the
stuffy
little
places
i
remember
that
newspaper
men
used
to
sit
in
their
little
holes
and
write
saying
of
him
that
the
times
made
mcgregor
i
do
not
know
about
that
the
city
caught
fire
from
the
man
at
the
time
of
that
terrible
speech
of
his
in
the
court
room
when
polk
street
mary
grew
afraid
and
told
the
truth
there
he
stood
the
raw
untried
miner
from
the
mines
and
the
tenderloin
facing
an
angry
court
and
a
swarm
of
protesting
lawyers
and
uttering
that
philippic
against
the
old
rotten
first
ward
and
the
creeping
cowardice
in
men
that
lets
vice
and
disease
go
on
and
pervade
all
modern
life
it
was
in
a
way
another
from
the
lips
of
another
zola
men
who
heard
it
have
told
me
that
when
he
had
finished
in
the
whole
court
no
man
spoke
and
no
man
dared
feel
guiltless
for
the
moment
something
a
section
a
cell
a
figment
of
men
brains
opened
and
in
that
terrible
illuminating
instant
they
saw
themselves
as
they
were
and
what
they
had
let
life
they
saw
something
else
or
thought
they
did
saw
mcgregor
a
new
force
for
chicago
to
reckon
with
after
the
trial
one
young
newspaper
man
returned
to
his
office
and
running
from
desk
to
desk
yelled
in
the
faces
of
his
brother
reporters
hell
out
for
noon
we
got
a
big
scotch
lawyer
up
here
on
van
buren
street
that
is
a
kind
of
a
new
scourge
of
the
world
watch
the
first
ward
get
but
mcgregor
never
looked
at
the
first
ward
that
was
bothering
him
from
the
court
room
he
went
to
march
with
men
in
a
new
field
followed
the
time
of
waiting
and
of
patient
quiet
work
in
the
evenings
mcgregor
worked
at
the
law
cases
in
the
bare
room
in
van
buren
street
that
queer
bird
henry
hunt
still
stayed
with
him
collecting
tithes
for
the
gang
and
going
to
his
respectable
home
at
night
a
strange
triumph
of
the
small
that
had
escaped
the
tongue
of
mcgregor
on
that
day
in
court
when
so
many
men
had
their
names
bruited
to
the
world
in
mcgregor
roll
call
the
roll
call
of
the
men
who
were
but
merchants
brothers
of
vice
the
men
who
should
have
been
masters
in
the
city
and
then
the
movement
of
the
marching
men
began
to
come
to
the
surface
it
got
into
the
blood
of
men
that
harsh
drumming
voice
began
to
shake
their
hearts
and
their
legs
everywhere
men
began
to
see
and
hear
of
the
marchers
from
lip
to
lip
ran
the
question
what
going
on
what
going
on
how
that
cry
ran
over
chicago
every
newspaper
man
in
town
got
assignments
on
the
story
the
papers
were
loaded
with
it
every
day
all
over
the
city
they
appeared
everywhere
the
marching
men
there
were
leaders
enough
the
cuban
war
and
the
state
militia
had
taught
too
many
men
the
swing
of
the
march
step
for
there
not
to
be
at
least
two
or
three
competent
drill
masters
in
every
little
company
of
men
and
there
was
the
marching
song
the
russian
wrote
for
mcgregor
who
could
forget
it
its
high
pitched
harsh
feminine
strain
rang
in
the
brain
how
it
went
pitching
and
tumbling
along
in
that
wailing
calling
endless
high
note
it
had
strange
breaks
and
intervals
in
the
rendering
the
men
did
not
sing
it
they
chanted
it
there
was
in
it
just
the
weird
haunting
something
the
russians
know
how
to
put
into
their
songs
and
into
the
books
they
write
it
is
the
quality
of
the
soil
some
of
our
own
music
has
that
but
in
this
russian
song
there
was
something
else
something
and
religious
a
soul
a
spirit
perhaps
it
is
just
the
spirit
that
broods
over
that
strange
land
and
people
there
was
something
of
russia
in
mcgregor
himself
anyway
the
marching
song
was
the
most
persistently
penetrating
thing
americans
had
ever
heard
it
was
in
the
streets
the
shops
the
offices
the
alleys
and
in
the
air
overhead
the
wail
half
shout
no
noise
could
drown
it
it
swung
and
pitched
and
rioted
through
the
air
and
there
was
the
fellow
who
wrote
the
music
down
for
mcgregor
he
was
the
real
thing
and
he
bore
the
marks
of
the
shackles
on
his
legs
he
had
remembered
the
march
from
hearing
the
men
sing
it
as
they
went
over
the
steppes
to
siberia
the
men
who
were
going
up
out
of
misery
to
more
misery
it
would
come
out
of
the
air
he
explained
the
guards
would
run
down
the
line
of
men
to
shout
and
strike
out
with
their
short
whips
it
they
cried
and
still
it
went
on
for
hours
defying
everything
there
on
the
cold
cheerless
and
he
had
brought
it
to
america
and
put
it
to
music
for
marchers
of
course
the
police
tried
to
stop
the
marchers
into
a
street
they
would
run
crying
disperse
the
men
did
disperse
only
to
appear
again
on
some
vacant
lot
working
away
at
the
perfection
of
the
marching
once
an
excited
squad
of
police
captured
a
company
of
them
the
same
men
were
back
in
line
the
next
evening
the
police
could
not
arrest
a
hundred
thousand
men
because
they
marched
shoulder
to
shoulder
along
the
streets
and
chanted
a
weird
march
song
as
they
went
the
whole
thing
was
not
an
outbreak
of
labour
it
was
something
different
from
anything
that
had
come
into
the
world
before
the
unions
were
in
it
but
besides
the
unions
there
were
the
poles
the
russian
jews
the
hunks
from
the
stockyards
and
the
steel
works
in
south
chicago
they
had
their
own
leaders
speaking
their
own
languages
and
how
they
could
throw
their
legs
into
the
march
the
armies
of
the
old
world
had
for
years
been
training
men
for
the
strange
demonstration
that
had
broken
out
in
chicago
the
thing
was
hypnotic
it
was
big
it
is
absurd
to
sit
writing
of
it
now
in
such
majestic
terms
but
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
newspapers
of
that
day
to
realise
how
the
imagination
of
men
was
caught
and
held
every
train
brought
writers
tumbling
into
chicago
in
the
evening
fifty
of
them
would
gather
in
the
back
room
at
weingardner
restaurant
where
such
men
congregate
and
then
the
thing
broke
out
all
over
the
country
in
steel
towns
like
pittsburgh
and
johnstown
and
lorain
and
mckeesport
and
men
working
in
little
independent
factories
in
towns
down
in
indiana
began
drilling
and
chanting
the
march
song
on
summer
evenings
on
the
village
baseball
ground
how
the
people
the
comfortable
middle
class
people
were
afraid
it
swept
over
the
country
like
a
religious
revival
the
creeping
dread
the
writing
men
got
to
mcgregor
the
brain
back
of
it
all
fast
enough
everywhere
his
influence
appeared
in
the
afternoon
there
would
be
a
hundred
newspaper
men
standing
on
the
stairway
leading
up
to
the
big
bare
office
in
van
buren
street
at
his
desk
he
sat
big
and
red
and
silent
he
looked
like
a
man
half
asleep
i
suppose
the
thing
that
was
in
their
minds
had
something
to
do
with
the
way
men
looked
at
him
but
in
any
case
the
crowd
in
weingardner
agreed
that
there
was
in
the
man
something
of
the
same
bigness
there
was
in
the
movement
he
had
started
and
was
guiding
it
seems
absurdly
simple
now
there
he
sat
at
his
desk
the
police
might
have
walked
in
and
arrested
him
but
if
you
begin
figuring
that
way
the
whole
thing
was
absurd
what
differs
it
if
men
march
coming
from
work
swinging
along
shoulder
to
shoulder
or
shuffle
aimlessly
along
and
what
harm
can
come
out
of
the
singing
of
a
song
you
see
mcgregor
understood
something
that
all
of
us
had
not
counted
on
he
knew
that
every
one
has
an
imagination
he
was
at
war
with
minds
he
challenged
something
in
us
that
we
hardly
realised
was
there
he
had
been
sitting
there
for
years
thinking
it
out
he
had
watched
dowie
and
eddy
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
a
crowd
of
newspaper
men
went
one
night
to
hear
mcgregor
at
a
big
outdoor
meeting
up
on
the
north
side
cowell
was
with
them
the
big
english
statesman
and
writer
who
later
was
drowned
on
the
he
was
a
big
man
physically
and
mentally
and
was
in
chicago
to
see
mcgregor
and
try
to
understand
what
he
was
doing
and
mcgregor
got
him
as
he
had
all
men
out
there
under
the
sky
the
men
stood
silent
cowell
head
sticking
up
above
the
sea
of
faces
and
mcgregor
talked
the
newspaper
men
declared
he
could
not
talk
they
were
wrong
about
that
mcgregor
had
a
way
of
throwing
up
his
arms
and
straining
and
shouting
out
his
sentences
that
got
to
the
souls
of
men
he
was
a
kind
of
crude
artist
drawing
pictures
on
the
mind
that
night
he
talked
about
labour
as
always
labour
personified
huge
crude
old
labour
how
he
made
the
men
before
him
see
and
feel
the
blind
giant
who
has
lived
in
the
world
since
time
began
and
who
still
goes
stumbling
blindly
about
rubbing
his
eyes
and
lying
down
to
sleep
away
centuries
in
the
dust
of
the
fields
and
the
factories
a
man
arose
in
the
audience
and
climbed
upon
the
platform
beside
mcgregor
it
was
a
daring
thing
to
do
and
men
knees
trembled
while
the
man
was
crawling
up
to
the
platform
shouts
arose
one
has
in
mind
a
picture
of
a
bustling
little
fellow
going
into
the
house
and
into
the
upper
room
where
jesus
and
his
followers
were
having
the
last
supper
together
going
in
there
to
wrangle
about
the
price
to
be
paid
for
the
wine
the
man
who
got
on
the
platform
with
mcgregor
was
a
socialist
he
wanted
to
argue
but
mcgregor
did
not
argue
with
him
he
sprang
forward
it
was
a
quick
movement
and
spun
the
socialist
about
making
him
stand
small
and
blinking
and
comical
before
the
crowd
then
mcgregor
began
to
talk
he
made
of
the
little
stuttering
arguing
socialist
a
figure
representing
all
labour
made
him
the
personification
of
the
old
weary
struggle
of
the
world
and
the
socialist
who
went
to
argue
stood
with
tears
in
his
eyes
proud
of
his
position
in
men
eyes
all
over
the
city
mcgregor
talked
of
old
labour
and
how
he
was
to
be
built
up
and
put
before
men
eyes
by
the
movement
of
the
marching
men
how
our
legs
tingled
to
fall
in
step
and
go
marching
away
with
him
out
of
the
crowds
there
came
the
note
of
that
wailing
march
some
one
always
started
that
that
night
on
the
north
side
doctor
cowell
got
hold
of
the
shoulder
of
a
newspaper
man
and
led
him
to
a
car
he
who
knew
bismarck
and
who
had
sat
in
council
with
kings
went
walking
and
babbling
half
the
night
through
the
empty
streets
it
is
amusing
now
to
think
of
the
things
men
said
under
the
influence
of
mcgregor
like
old
doctor
johnson
and
his
friend
savage
they
walked
half
drunk
through
the
streets
swearing
that
whatever
happened
they
would
stick
to
the
movement
doctor
cowell
himself
said
things
just
as
absurd
as
that
and
all
over
the
country
men
were
getting
the
idea
the
marching
men
old
labour
in
one
mass
marching
before
the
eyes
of
men
old
labour
that
was
going
to
make
the
world
see
see
and
feel
its
bigness
at
last
men
were
to
come
to
the
end
of
strife
men
united
marching
marching
marching
chapter
v
in
all
of
the
time
of
the
marching
men
there
was
but
one
bit
of
written
matter
from
the
leader
mcgregor
it
had
a
circulation
running
into
the
millions
and
was
printed
in
every
tongue
spoken
in
america
a
copy
of
the
little
circular
lies
before
me
now
the
marchers
they
ask
us
what
we
mean
well
here
is
our
answer
we
mean
to
go
on
marching
we
mean
to
march
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
when
the
sun
goes
down
on
sundays
they
may
sit
on
their
porches
or
shout
at
men
playing
ball
in
a
field
but
we
will
march
on
the
hard
cobblestones
of
the
city
streets
and
through
the
dust
of
country
roads
we
will
march
our
legs
may
be
weary
and
our
throats
hot
and
dry
but
still
we
will
march
shoulder
to
shoulder
we
will
march
until
the
ground
shakes
and
tall
buildings
tremble
shoulder
to
shoulder
we
will
go
all
of
us
on
and
on
forever
we
will
not
talk
nor
listen
to
talk
we
will
march
and
we
will
teach
our
sons
and
our
daughters
to
march
their
minds
are
troubled
our
minds
are
clear
we
do
not
think
and
banter
words
we
march
our
faces
are
coarse
and
there
is
dust
in
our
hair
and
beards
see
the
inner
parts
of
our
hands
are
rough
and
still
we
march
we
the
chapter
vi
who
will
ever
forget
that
labour
day
in
chicago
how
they
marched
thousands
and
thousands
and
more
thousands
they
filled
the
streets
the
cars
stopped
men
trembled
with
the
import
of
the
impending
hour
here
they
come
how
the
ground
trembles
the
chant
chant
chant
of
that
song
it
must
have
been
thus
that
grant
felt
at
the
great
review
of
the
veterans
in
washington
when
all
day
long
they
marched
past
him
the
men
of
the
civil
war
the
whites
of
their
eyes
showing
in
the
tan
of
their
faces
mcgregor
stood
on
the
stone
curbing
above
the
tracks
in
grant
park
as
the
men
marched
they
massed
in
there
about
him
thousands
of
them
steel
workers
and
iron
workers
and
great
butchers
and
teamsters
and
in
the
air
wailed
the
marching
song
of
the
workers
all
of
the
world
that
was
not
marching
jammed
into
the
buildings
facing
michigan
boulevard
and
waited
margaret
ormsby
was
there
she
sat
with
her
father
in
a
carriage
near
where
van
buren
street
ends
at
the
boulevard
as
the
men
kept
crowding
in
about
them
she
clutched
nervously
at
the
sleeve
of
david
ormsby
coat
he
is
going
to
speak
she
whispered
and
pointed
her
tense
air
of
expectancy
expressed
much
of
the
feeling
of
the
crowd
see
listen
he
is
going
to
speak
it
must
have
been
five
in
the
afternoon
when
the
men
got
through
marching
they
were
massed
in
there
clear
down
to
the
twelfth
street
station
of
the
illinois
central
mcgregor
lifted
his
hands
in
the
hush
his
harsh
voice
carried
far
we
are
at
the
beginning
he
shouted
and
silence
fell
upon
the
people
in
the
stillness
one
standing
near
her
might
have
heard
margaret
ormsby
weeping
softly
there
was
the
gentle
murmur
that
always
prevails
where
many
people
stand
at
attention
the
weeping
of
the
woman
was
scarcely
audible
but
it
persisted
like
the
sound
of
little
waves
on
a
beach
at
the
end
of
the
day
book
vii
chapter
i
the
idea
prevalent
among
men
that
the
woman
to
be
beautiful
must
be
hedged
about
and
protected
from
the
facts
of
life
has
done
something
more
than
produce
a
race
of
women
not
physically
vigorous
it
has
made
them
deficient
in
strength
of
soul
also
after
the
evening
when
she
stood
facing
edith
and
when
she
had
been
unable
to
arise
to
the
challenge
flung
at
her
by
the
little
milliner
margaret
ormsby
was
forced
to
stand
facing
her
own
soul
and
there
was
no
strength
in
her
for
the
test
her
mind
insisted
on
justifying
her
failure
a
woman
of
the
people
placed
in
such
a
position
would
have
been
able
to
face
it
calmly
she
would
have
gone
soberly
and
steadily
about
her
work
and
after
a
few
months
of
pulling
weeds
in
a
field
trimming
hats
in
a
shop
or
instructing
children
in
a
schoolroom
would
have
been
ready
to
thrust
out
again
making
another
trial
at
life
having
met
many
defeats
she
would
have
been
armed
and
ready
for
defeat
like
a
little
animal
in
a
forest
inhabited
by
other
and
larger
animals
she
would
have
known
the
effectiveness
of
lying
perfectly
still
for
a
long
period
making
her
patience
a
part
of
her
equipment
for
living
margaret
had
decided
that
she
hated
mcgregor
after
the
scene
in
her
house
she
gave
up
her
work
in
the
settlement
house
and
for
a
long
time
went
about
nursing
her
hatred
in
the
street
as
she
walked
about
her
mind
kept
bringing
accusations
against
him
and
in
her
room
at
night
she
sat
by
the
window
looking
at
the
stars
and
said
strong
words
he
is
a
brute
she
declared
hotly
a
mere
animal
untouched
by
the
culture
that
makes
for
gentleness
there
is
something
and
horrible
in
my
nature
that
has
made
me
care
for
him
i
shall
pluck
it
out
in
the
future
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
forget
the
man
and
all
of
the
dreadful
lower
strata
of
life
that
he
filled
with
this
idea
margaret
went
about
among
her
own
people
and
tried
to
become
interested
in
the
men
and
women
she
met
at
dinners
and
receptions
it
did
not
work
and
when
after
a
few
evenings
spent
in
the
company
of
men
absorbed
in
the
getting
of
money
she
found
them
only
dull
creatures
whose
mouths
were
filled
with
meaningless
words
her
irritation
grew
and
she
blamed
mcgregor
for
that
also
he
had
no
right
to
come
into
my
consciousness
and
then
take
himself
off
she
declared
bitterly
the
man
is
more
of
a
brute
than
i
thought
he
no
doubt
preys
upon
everyone
as
he
has
preyed
upon
me
he
is
without
tenderness
knows
nothing
of
the
meaning
of
tenderness
the
colourless
creature
he
has
married
will
serve
his
body
that
is
what
he
wants
he
does
not
want
beauty
he
is
a
coward
who
dare
not
stand
up
to
beauty
and
is
afraid
of
when
the
marching
men
movement
began
to
make
a
stir
in
chicago
margaret
went
on
a
visit
to
new
york
for
a
month
she
lived
with
two
women
friends
at
a
big
hotel
near
the
sea
and
then
hurried
home
i
will
see
the
man
and
hear
him
talk
she
told
herself
i
can
not
cure
myself
of
the
consciousness
of
him
by
running
away
perhaps
i
am
myself
a
coward
i
shall
go
into
his
presence
when
i
hear
his
brutal
words
and
see
again
the
hard
gleam
that
sometimes
comes
into
his
eyes
i
shall
be
margaret
went
to
hear
mcgregor
talk
to
a
gathering
of
workingmen
in
a
west
side
hall
and
came
away
more
alive
to
him
than
ever
in
the
hall
she
sat
concealed
in
deep
shadows
by
the
door
and
waited
with
trembling
eagerness
on
all
sides
of
her
were
men
crowded
together
their
faces
were
washed
but
the
grime
of
the
shops
was
not
quite
effaced
men
from
the
steel
mills
with
the
cooked
look
that
follows
long
exposure
to
intense
artificial
heat
men
of
the
building
trades
with
their
broad
hands
big
men
and
small
men
misshapen
and
straight
labouring
men
all
sat
at
attention
waiting
margaret
noticed
that
as
mcgregor
talked
the
lips
of
the
working
men
moved
fists
were
clenched
applause
came
quick
and
sharp
like
the
report
of
guns
in
the
shadows
at
the
further
side
of
the
hall
the
black
coats
of
the
workers
made
a
blot
out
of
which
intense
faces
looked
and
across
which
the
flickering
gas
jets
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
threw
dancing
lights
the
words
of
the
speaker
were
shot
forth
the
sentences
seemed
broken
and
disconnected
as
he
talked
giant
pictures
flashed
through
the
minds
of
the
hearers
men
felt
themselves
big
and
exalted
a
little
steel
worker
sitting
near
margaret
who
earlier
in
the
evening
had
been
abused
by
his
wife
because
he
wanted
to
come
to
the
meeting
instead
of
helping
with
the
dishes
at
home
stared
fiercely
about
he
thought
he
would
like
to
fight
hand
in
hand
with
a
wild
animal
in
a
forest
standing
on
the
narrow
stage
mcgregor
seemed
a
giant
seeking
expression
his
mouth
worked
the
sweat
stood
upon
his
forehead
and
he
moved
restlessly
up
and
down
at
times
with
his
hands
advanced
and
with
the
eager
forward
crouch
of
his
body
he
was
like
a
wrestler
waiting
to
grapple
with
an
opponent
margaret
was
deeply
moved
her
years
of
training
and
of
refinement
were
stripped
off
and
she
felt
that
like
the
women
of
the
french
revolution
she
would
like
to
go
out
into
the
streets
and
march
screaming
and
fighting
in
feminine
rage
for
the
things
of
this
man
mind
mcgregor
had
scarcely
begun
to
talk
his
personality
the
big
eager
something
in
him
had
caught
and
held
this
audience
as
it
had
caught
and
held
other
audiences
in
other
halls
and
was
to
hold
them
night
after
night
for
months
mcgregor
was
something
the
men
to
whom
he
talked
understood
he
was
themselves
become
expressive
and
he
moved
them
as
no
other
leader
had
ever
moved
them
before
his
very
lack
of
glibness
the
things
in
him
wanting
expression
and
not
getting
expressed
made
him
seem
like
one
of
them
he
did
not
confuse
their
minds
but
drew
for
them
great
scrawling
pictures
and
to
them
he
cried
march
and
for
marching
he
promised
them
realisation
of
themselves
i
have
heard
men
in
colleges
and
speakers
in
halls
talk
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
he
cried
they
do
not
want
such
a
brotherhood
they
would
flee
before
it
but
we
will
make
by
our
marching
such
a
brotherhood
that
they
will
tremble
and
say
to
one
another
old
labour
is
awake
he
has
found
his
strength
they
will
hide
themselves
and
eat
their
words
of
brotherhood
a
clamour
of
voices
will
arise
many
voices
crying
out
cease
marching
i
am
afraid
this
talk
of
brotherhood
the
words
mean
nothing
man
can
not
love
man
we
do
not
know
what
they
mean
by
such
love
they
hurt
us
and
underpay
us
sometimes
one
of
us
gets
an
arm
torn
off
are
we
to
lie
in
our
beds
loving
the
man
who
gets
rich
from
the
iron
machine
that
ripped
the
arm
from
the
shoulder
on
our
knees
and
in
our
arms
we
have
borne
their
children
on
the
streets
we
see
them
the
petted
children
of
our
madness
see
we
have
let
them
run
about
misbehaving
we
have
given
them
automobiles
and
wives
with
soft
clinging
dresses
when
they
have
cried
we
have
cared
for
them
and
they
being
children
with
the
minds
of
children
are
confused
the
noise
of
affairs
alarms
them
they
run
about
shaking
their
ringers
and
commanding
they
speak
with
pity
of
us
labour
their
father
and
now
we
will
show
them
their
father
in
his
might
the
little
machines
they
have
in
their
factories
are
toys
we
have
given
them
and
that
for
the
time
we
leave
in
their
hands
we
do
not
think
of
the
toys
nor
the
women
we
make
of
ourselves
a
mighty
army
a
marching
army
going
along
shoulder
to
shoulder
we
can
love
that
when
they
see
us
hundreds
of
thousands
of
us
marching
into
their
minds
and
into
their
consciousness
then
will
they
be
afraid
and
at
the
little
meetings
they
have
when
three
or
four
of
them
sit
talking
daring
to
decide
what
things
we
shall
have
from
life
there
will
be
in
their
minds
a
picture
we
will
stamp
it
there
they
have
forgotten
our
power
let
us
reawaken
it
see
i
shake
old
labour
by
the
shoulder
he
arouses
he
sits
up
he
thrusts
his
huge
form
up
from
where
he
was
asleep
in
the
dust
and
the
smoke
of
the
mills
they
look
at
him
and
are
afraid
see
they
tremble
and
run
away
falling
over
each
other
the
did
not
know
old
labour
was
so
big
but
you
workers
are
not
afraid
you
are
the
arms
and
the
legs
and
the
hands
and
the
eyes
of
labour
you
have
thought
yourself
small
you
have
not
got
yourself
into
one
mass
so
that
i
could
shake
and
arouse
you
you
must
get
that
way
you
must
march
shoulder
to
shoulder
you
must
march
so
that
you
yourselves
shall
come
to
know
what
a
giant
you
are
if
one
of
your
number
whines
or
complains
or
stands
upon
a
box
throwing
words
about
knock
him
down
and
keep
marching
when
you
have
marched
until
you
are
one
giant
body
then
will
happen
a
miracle
a
brain
will
grow
in
the
giant
you
have
made
will
you
march
with
me
like
a
volley
from
a
battery
of
guns
came
the
sharp
reply
from
the
eager
upturned
faces
of
the
audience
we
will
let
us
march
they
shouted
margaret
ormsby
went
out
at
the
door
and
into
the
crowds
on
madison
street
as
she
walked
in
the
press
she
lifted
her
head
in
pride
that
a
man
possessed
of
such
a
brain
and
of
the
simple
courage
to
try
to
express
such
magnificent
ideas
through
human
beings
had
ever
shown
favour
toward
her
humbleness
swept
over
her
and
she
blamed
herself
for
the
petty
thoughts
concerning
him
that
had
been
in
her
mind
it
does
not
matter
she
whispered
to
herself
now
i
know
that
nothing
matters
nothing
but
his
success
he
must
do
this
thing
he
has
set
out
to
do
he
must
not
be
denied
i
would
give
the
blood
out
of
my
body
or
expose
my
body
to
shame
if
that
could
bring
him
margaret
became
exalted
in
her
humbleness
when
her
carriage
had
taken
her
to
her
house
she
ran
quickly
upstairs
to
her
own
room
and
knelt
by
her
bed
she
started
to
pray
but
presently
stopped
and
sprang
to
her
feet
running
to
the
window
she
looked
off
across
the
city
he
must
succeed
she
cried
again
i
shall
myself
be
one
of
his
marchers
i
will
do
anything
for
him
he
is
tearing
the
veil
from
my
eyes
from
all
men
eyes
we
are
children
in
the
hands
of
this
giant
and
he
must
not
meet
defeat
at
the
hands
of
chapter
ii
on
the
day
of
the
great
demonstration
when
mcgregor
power
over
the
minds
and
the
bodies
of
the
men
of
labour
sent
hundreds
of
thousands
marching
and
singing
in
the
streets
there
was
one
man
who
was
untouched
by
the
song
of
labour
expressed
in
the
threshing
of
feet
david
ormsby
had
in
his
quiet
way
thought
things
out
he
expected
that
the
new
impetus
given
to
solidity
in
the
ranks
of
labour
would
make
trouble
for
him
and
his
kind
that
it
would
express
itself
finally
in
strikes
and
in
industrial
disturbance
he
was
not
worried
in
the
end
he
thought
that
the
silent
patient
power
of
money
would
bring
his
people
the
victory
on
that
day
he
did
not
go
to
his
office
but
in
the
morning
stayed
in
his
own
room
thinking
of
mcgregor
and
of
his
daughter
laura
ormsby
was
out
of
the
city
but
margaret
was
at
home
david
believed
he
had
measured
accurately
the
power
of
mcgregor
over
her
mind
but
occasional
doubts
came
to
him
well
the
time
has
come
to
have
it
out
with
her
he
decided
i
must
reassert
my
ascendency
over
her
mind
the
thing
that
is
going
on
here
is
really
a
struggle
of
minds
mcgregor
differs
from
other
leaders
of
labour
as
i
differ
from
most
leaders
of
the
forces
of
money
he
has
brains
very
well
i
shall
meet
him
on
that
level
then
when
i
have
made
margaret
think
as
i
think
she
will
return
to
when
he
was
still
a
small
manufacturer
in
the
wisconsin
town
david
had
been
in
the
habit
of
driving
out
in
the
evening
with
his
daughter
during
the
drives
he
had
been
almost
a
lover
in
his
attentions
to
the
child
and
now
when
he
thought
of
the
forces
at
work
within
her
he
was
convinced
that
she
was
still
a
child
early
in
the
afternoon
he
had
a
carriage
brought
to
the
door
and
drove
off
with
her
to
the
city
she
will
want
to
see
the
man
in
the
height
of
his
power
if
i
am
right
in
thinking
that
she
is
still
under
the
influence
of
his
personality
there
will
be
a
romantic
desire
for
that
i
will
give
her
the
chance
he
thought
proudly
in
this
struggle
i
ask
no
quarter
from
him
and
shall
not
make
the
common
mistake
of
parents
in
such
cases
she
is
fascinated
by
the
figure
he
has
made
of
himself
showy
men
who
stand
out
from
the
crowd
have
that
power
she
is
still
under
his
influence
why
else
her
constant
distraction
and
her
want
of
interest
in
other
things
now
i
will
be
with
her
when
the
man
is
most
powerful
when
he
shows
to
the
greatest
advantage
and
then
i
will
make
my
fight
for
her
i
will
point
out
to
her
another
road
the
road
along
which
the
real
victors
in
life
must
learn
to
together
david
the
quiet
efficient
representative
of
wealth
and
his
woman
child
sat
in
the
carriage
on
the
day
of
mcgregor
triumph
for
the
moment
an
impassable
gulf
seemed
to
separate
them
and
with
intense
eyes
each
watched
the
hordes
of
men
who
massed
themselves
about
the
labour
leader
at
the
moment
mcgregor
seemed
to
have
caught
all
men
in
the
sweep
of
his
movement
business
men
had
closed
their
desks
labour
was
exultant
writers
and
men
given
to
speculation
in
thought
walked
about
dreaming
of
the
realisation
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
in
the
long
narrow
treeless
park
the
music
made
by
the
steady
thresh
of
feet
arose
to
something
vast
and
rhythmical
it
was
like
a
mighty
chorus
come
up
out
of
the
hearts
of
men
david
was
unmoved
occasionally
he
spoke
to
the
horses
and
looked
from
the
faces
of
the
men
massed
about
him
to
his
daughter
face
in
the
coarse
faces
of
the
men
he
thought
he
saw
only
a
crude
sort
of
intoxication
the
result
of
a
new
kind
of
emotionalism
it
will
not
outlast
thirty
days
of
ordinary
living
in
their
squalid
surroundings
he
thought
grimly
it
is
not
the
kind
of
exaltation
for
margaret
i
can
sing
her
a
more
wonderful
song
i
must
get
myself
ready
for
when
mcgregor
arose
to
speak
margaret
was
overcome
with
emotions
dropping
to
her
knees
in
the
carriage
she
put
her
head
down
upon
her
father
arm
for
days
she
had
been
telling
herself
that
in
the
future
of
the
man
she
loved
there
was
no
place
for
failure
now
again
she
whispered
to
herself
that
this
great
sturdy
figure
must
not
be
denied
the
fulfilment
of
its
purpose
when
in
the
hush
that
followed
the
massing
of
the
labourers
about
him
the
harsh
booming
voice
floated
over
the
heads
of
the
people
her
body
shook
as
with
a
chill
extravagant
fancies
invaded
her
mind
and
she
wished
it
were
possible
for
her
to
do
something
heroic
something
that
would
make
her
live
again
in
the
mind
of
mcgregor
she
wanted
to
serve
him
to
give
him
something
out
of
herself
and
thought
wildly
that
there
might
yet
come
a
time
and
a
way
by
which
the
beauty
of
her
body
could
be
laid
like
a
gift
before
him
the
half
mythical
figure
of
mary
the
lover
of
jesus
came
into
her
mind
and
she
aspired
to
be
such
another
with
her
body
shaken
with
emotions
she
pulled
at
the
sleeve
of
her
father
coat
listen
it
is
going
to
come
now
she
murmured
the
brain
of
labour
is
going
to
express
the
dream
of
labour
an
impulse
sweet
and
lasting
is
going
to
come
into
the
david
ormsby
said
nothing
when
mcgregor
had
begun
to
speak
he
touched
the
horses
with
the
whip
and
drove
slowly
along
van
buren
street
past
the
silent
attentive
ranks
of
men
when
he
had
got
into
one
of
the
streets
near
the
river
a
vast
cheer
arose
it
seemed
to
shake
the
city
and
the
horses
reared
and
leaped
forward
over
the
rough
cobblestones
with
one
hand
david
quieted
them
while
with
the
other
he
gripped
the
hand
of
his
daughter
they
drove
over
a
bridge
and
into
the
west
side
and
as
they
went
the
marching
song
of
the
workers
rising
up
out
of
thousands
of
throats
rang
in
their
ears
for
a
time
the
air
seemed
to
pulsate
with
it
but
as
they
went
westward
it
grew
continually
less
and
less
distinct
at
last
when
they
had
turned
into
a
street
lined
by
tall
factories
it
died
out
altogether
that
is
the
end
of
him
for
me
and
mine
thought
david
and
again
set
himself
for
the
task
he
had
to
perform
through
street
after
street
david
let
the
horses
wander
while
he
clung
to
his
daughter
hand
and
thought
of
what
he
wanted
to
say
not
all
of
the
streets
were
lined
with
factories
some
and
these
in
the
evening
light
were
the
most
hideous
were
bordered
by
the
homes
of
workers
the
houses
of
the
workers
jammed
closely
together
and
black
with
grime
were
filled
with
noisy
life
women
sat
in
the
doorways
and
children
ran
screaming
and
shouting
in
the
road
dogs
barked
and
howled
everywhere
was
dirt
and
disorder
the
terrible
evidence
of
men
failure
in
the
difficult
and
delicate
art
of
living
in
one
of
the
streets
a
little
girl
child
who
sat
on
the
post
of
a
fence
made
a
ludicrous
figure
as
david
and
margaret
drove
past
she
beat
with
her
heels
against
the
sides
of
the
post
and
screamed
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
and
her
dishevelled
hair
was
black
with
dirt
i
want
a
banana
i
want
a
banana
she
howled
staring
at
the
blank
walls
of
one
of
the
houses
in
spite
of
herself
margaret
was
touched
and
her
mind
left
the
figure
of
mcgregor
by
an
odd
chance
the
child
on
the
post
was
the
daughter
of
that
socialist
orator
who
one
night
on
the
north
side
had
climbed
upon
a
platform
to
confront
mcgregor
with
the
propaganda
of
the
socialist
party
david
turned
the
horses
into
a
wide
boulevard
that
ran
south
through
the
factory
district
of
the
west
as
they
came
out
into
the
boulevard
they
saw
sitting
on
the
sidewalk
before
a
saloon
a
drunkard
with
a
drum
in
his
hand
the
drunkard
beat
upon
the
drum
and
tried
to
sing
the
marching
song
of
the
workers
but
succeeded
only
in
making
a
queer
grunting
noise
like
a
distressed
animal
the
sight
brought
a
smile
to
david
lips
already
it
has
begun
to
disintegrate
he
muttered
i
brought
you
into
this
part
of
town
on
purpose
he
said
to
margaret
i
wanted
you
to
see
with
your
own
eyes
how
much
the
world
needs
the
thing
he
is
trying
to
do
the
man
is
terribly
right
about
the
need
for
discipline
and
order
he
is
a
big
man
doing
a
big
thing
and
i
admire
his
courage
he
would
be
a
really
big
man
had
he
the
greater
on
the
boulevard
into
which
they
had
turned
all
was
quiet
the
summer
sun
was
setting
and
over
the
roofs
of
buildings
the
west
was
ablaze
with
light
they
passed
a
factory
surrounded
by
little
patches
of
garden
some
employer
of
labour
had
tried
thus
feebly
to
bring
beauty
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
place
where
his
men
worked
david
pointed
with
the
whip
life
is
a
husk
he
said
and
we
men
of
affairs
who
take
ourselves
so
seriously
because
the
fates
have
been
good
to
us
have
odd
silly
little
fancies
see
what
this
fellow
has
been
at
patching
away
striving
to
create
beauty
on
the
shell
of
things
he
is
like
mcgregor
you
see
i
wonder
if
the
man
has
made
himself
beautiful
if
either
he
or
mcgregor
has
seen
to
it
that
there
is
something
lovely
inside
the
husk
he
wears
around
and
that
he
calls
his
body
if
he
has
seen
through
life
to
the
spirit
of
life
i
do
not
believe
in
patching
nor
do
i
believe
in
disturbing
the
shell
of
things
as
mcgregor
has
dared
to
do
i
have
my
own
beliefs
and
they
are
the
beliefs
of
my
kind
this
man
here
this
maker
of
little
gardens
is
like
mcgregor
he
might
better
let
men
find
their
own
beauty
that
is
my
way
i
have
i
want
to
think
kept
myself
for
the
sweeter
and
more
daring
david
turned
and
looked
hard
at
margaret
who
had
begun
to
be
influenced
by
his
mood
she
waited
looking
with
averted
face
at
the
sky
over
the
roofs
of
buildings
david
began
to
talk
of
himself
in
relation
to
her
and
her
mother
a
note
of
impatience
came
into
his
voice
how
far
you
have
been
carried
away
have
you
he
said
sharply
listen
i
am
not
talking
to
you
now
as
your
father
nor
as
daughter
let
us
be
clear
about
that
i
love
you
and
am
in
a
contest
to
win
your
love
i
am
mcgregor
rival
i
accept
the
handicap
of
fatherhood
i
love
you
you
see
i
have
let
something
within
myself
alight
upon
you
mcgregor
has
not
done
that
he
refused
what
you
had
to
offer
but
i
do
not
i
have
centred
my
life
upon
you
and
have
done
it
quite
knowingly
and
after
much
thought
the
feeling
i
have
is
something
quite
special
i
am
an
individualist
but
believe
in
the
oneness
of
man
and
woman
i
would
dare
venture
into
but
one
other
life
beyond
my
own
and
that
the
life
of
a
woman
i
have
chosen
to
ask
you
to
let
me
venture
so
into
your
life
we
will
talk
of
margaret
turned
and
looked
at
her
father
later
she
thought
that
some
strange
phenomena
must
have
happened
at
the
moment
something
like
a
film
was
torn
from
her
eyes
and
she
saw
the
man
david
not
as
a
shrewd
and
calculating
man
of
affairs
but
as
something
magnificently
young
not
only
was
he
strong
and
solid
but
in
his
face
there
was
at
the
moment
the
deep
lines
of
thought
and
suffering
she
had
seen
on
the
countenance
of
mcgregor
it
is
strange
she
thought
they
are
so
unlike
and
yet
the
two
men
are
both
i
married
your
mother
when
i
was
a
child
as
you
are
a
child
now
david
went
on
to
be
sure
i
had
a
passion
for
her
and
she
had
one
for
me
it
passed
but
it
was
beautiful
enough
while
it
lasted
it
did
not
have
depth
or
meaning
i
want
to
tell
you
why
then
i
am
going
to
make
you
understand
mcgregor
so
that
you
may
take
your
measure
of
the
man
i
am
coming
to
that
i
have
to
begin
at
the
beginning
my
factory
began
to
grow
and
as
an
employer
of
labour
i
became
concerned
in
the
lives
of
a
good
many
his
voice
again
became
sharp
i
have
been
impatient
with
you
he
said
do
you
think
this
mcgregor
is
the
only
man
who
has
seen
and
thought
of
other
men
in
the
mass
i
have
done
that
and
have
been
tempted
i
also
might
have
become
sentimental
and
destroyed
myself
i
did
not
loving
a
woman
saved
me
laura
did
that
for
me
although
when
it
came
to
the
real
test
of
our
love
understanding
she
failed
i
am
nevertheless
grateful
to
her
that
she
was
once
the
object
of
my
love
i
believe
in
the
beauty
of
again
david
paused
and
began
to
tell
his
story
in
a
new
way
the
figure
of
mcgregor
came
back
into
margaret
mind
and
her
father
began
to
feel
that
to
take
it
entirely
away
would
be
an
accomplishment
full
of
significance
if
i
can
take
her
from
him
i
and
my
kind
can
take
the
world
from
him
also
he
thought
it
will
be
another
victory
for
the
aristocracy
in
the
battle
with
the
i
came
to
a
turning
point
he
said
aloud
all
men
come
to
that
point
to
be
sure
the
great
mass
of
people
drift
quite
stupidly
but
we
are
not
now
talking
of
people
in
general
there
is
you
and
me
and
there
is
the
thing
mcgregor
might
be
we
are
each
in
our
way
something
special
we
come
people
like
us
to
a
place
where
there
are
two
roads
to
take
i
took
one
and
mcgregor
has
taken
another
i
know
why
and
perhaps
he
knows
why
i
concede
to
him
knowledge
of
what
he
has
done
but
now
it
is
time
for
you
to
decide
which
road
you
will
take
you
have
seen
the
crowds
moving
along
the
broad
way
he
has
chosen
and
now
you
will
set
out
on
your
own
way
i
want
you
to
look
down
my
road
with
they
came
to
a
bridge
over
a
canal
and
david
stopped
the
horses
a
body
of
mcgregor
marchers
passed
and
margaret
pulse
began
to
beat
high
again
when
she
looked
at
her
father
however
he
was
unmoved
and
she
was
a
little
ashamed
of
her
emotions
for
a
moment
david
waited
as
though
for
inspiration
and
when
the
horses
started
on
again
he
began
to
talk
a
labour
leader
came
to
my
factory
a
miniature
mcgregor
with
a
crooked
twist
to
him
he
was
a
rascal
but
the
things
he
said
to
my
men
were
all
true
enough
i
was
making
money
for
my
investors
a
lot
of
it
they
might
have
won
in
a
fight
with
me
one
evening
i
went
out
into
the
country
to
walk
alone
under
the
trees
and
think
it
david
voice
became
harsh
and
margaret
thought
it
had
become
strangely
like
the
voice
of
mcgregor
talking
to
workingmen
i
bought
the
man
off
david
said
i
used
the
cruel
weapon
men
like
me
have
to
use
i
gave
him
money
and
told
him
to
get
out
to
let
me
alone
i
did
it
because
i
had
to
win
my
kind
of
men
always
have
to
win
during
the
walk
i
took
alone
i
got
hold
of
my
dream
my
belief
i
have
the
same
dream
now
it
means
more
to
me
than
the
welfare
of
a
million
men
for
it
i
would
crush
whatever
opposed
me
i
am
going
to
tell
you
of
the
dream
it
is
too
bad
one
has
to
talk
talk
kills
dreams
and
talk
will
also
kill
all
such
men
as
mcgregor
now
that
he
has
begun
to
talk
we
will
get
the
best
of
him
i
do
not
worry
about
mcgregor
time
and
talk
will
bring
about
his
david
mind
ran
off
in
a
new
direction
i
do
not
think
a
man
life
is
of
much
importance
he
said
no
man
is
big
enough
to
grasp
all
of
life
that
is
the
foolish
fancy
of
children
the
grown
man
knows
he
can
not
see
life
at
one
great
sweep
it
can
not
be
comprehended
so
one
has
to
realise
that
he
lives
in
a
patchwork
of
many
lives
and
many
impulses
the
man
must
strike
at
beauty
that
is
the
realisation
maturity
brings
and
that
is
where
the
woman
conies
in
that
is
what
mcgregor
was
not
wise
enough
to
understand
he
is
a
child
you
see
in
a
land
of
excitable
the
quality
of
david
voice
changed
putting
his
arm
about
his
daughter
he
drew
her
face
down
beside
his
own
night
descended
upon
them
the
woman
who
was
tired
from
much
thinking
began
to
feel
grateful
for
the
touch
of
the
strong
hand
on
her
shoulder
david
had
accomplished
his
purpose
he
had
for
the
moment
made
his
daughter
forget
that
she
was
his
daughter
there
was
something
hypnotic
in
the
quiet
strength
of
his
mood
i
come
now
to
women
to
your
part
he
said
we
will
talk
of
the
thing
i
want
to
make
you
understand
laura
failed
as
the
woman
she
never
saw
the
point
as
i
grew
she
did
not
grow
with
me
because
i
did
not
talk
of
love
she
did
not
understand
me
as
a
lover
did
not
know
what
i
wanted
what
i
demanded
of
her
i
wanted
to
fit
my
love
down
upon
her
figure
as
one
puts
a
glove
on
his
hand
you
see
i
was
the
adventurer
the
man
mussed
and
moiled
by
life
and
its
problems
the
struggle
to
exist
to
get
money
could
not
be
avoided
i
had
to
make
that
struggle
she
did
not
why
could
she
not
understand
that
i
did
not
want
to
come
into
her
presence
to
rest
or
to
say
empty
words
i
wanted
her
to
help
me
create
beauty
we
should
have
been
partners
in
that
together
we
should
have
undertaken
the
most
delicate
and
difficult
of
all
struggles
the
struggle
for
living
beauty
in
our
everyday
bitterness
swept
over
the
old
ploughmaker
and
he
used
strong
words
the
whole
point
is
in
what
i
am
now
saying
that
was
my
cry
to
the
woman
it
came
out
of
my
soul
it
was
the
only
cry
to
another
i
have
ever
made
laura
was
a
little
fool
her
mind
flitted
away
to
little
things
i
do
not
know
what
she
wanted
me
to
be
and
now
i
do
not
care
perhaps
she
wanted
me
to
be
a
poet
a
stringer
together
of
words
one
to
write
shrill
little
songs
about
her
eyes
and
lips
it
does
not
matter
now
what
she
wanted
but
you
david
voice
cut
through
the
fog
of
new
thoughts
that
were
confusing
his
daughter
mind
and
she
could
feel
his
body
stiffen
a
thrill
ran
through
her
own
body
and
she
forgot
mcgregor
with
all
the
strength
of
her
spirit
she
was
absorbed
in
what
david
was
saying
in
the
challenge
that
was
coming
from
the
lips
of
her
father
she
began
to
feel
there
would
be
born
in
her
own
life
a
definite
purpose
women
want
to
push
out
into
life
to
share
with
men
the
disorder
and
mussiness
of
little
things
what
a
desire
let
them
try
it
if
they
wish
they
will
sicken
of
the
attempt
they
lose
sight
of
something
bigger
they
might
undertake
they
have
forgotten
the
old
things
ruth
in
the
corn
and
mary
with
the
jar
of
precious
ointment
they
have
forgotten
the
beauty
they
were
meant
to
help
men
create
let
them
share
only
in
man
attempt
to
create
beauty
that
is
the
big
the
delicate
task
to
which
they
should
consecrate
themselves
why
attempt
instead
the
cheaper
the
secondary
task
they
are
like
this
the
ploughmaker
became
silent
taking
up
the
whip
he
drove
the
horses
rapidly
along
he
thought
that
his
point
was
made
and
was
satisfied
to
let
the
imagination
of
his
daughter
do
the
rest
they
turned
off
the
boulevard
and
passed
through
a
street
of
small
stores
before
a
saloon
a
troop
of
street
urchins
led
by
a
drunken
man
without
a
hat
gave
a
grotesque
imitation
of
mcgregor
marchers
before
a
crowd
of
laughing
idlers
with
a
sinking
heart
margaret
realised
that
even
at
the
height
of
his
power
the
forces
that
would
eventually
destroy
the
impulses
back
of
mcgregor
marchers
were
at
work
she
crept
closer
to
david
i
love
you
she
said
some
day
i
may
have
a
lover
but
always
i
shall
love
you
i
shall
try
to
be
what
you
want
of
it
was
past
two
that
night
when
david
arose
from
the
chair
where
he
had
been
for
several
hours
quietly
reading
with
a
smile
on
his
face
he
went
to
a
window
facing
north
toward
the
city
all
through
the
evening
groups
of
men
had
been
passing
the
house
some
had
gone
scuffling
along
a
mere
disorderly
mob
some
had
gone
shoulder
to
shoulder
chanting
the
marching
song
of
the
workers
and
a
few
under
the
influence
of
drink
had
stopped
before
the
house
to
roar
out
threats
now
all
was
quiet
david
lighted
a
cigar
and
stood
for
a
long
time
looking
out
over
the
city
he
was
thinking
of
mcgregor
and
wondering
what
excited
dream
of
power
the
day
had
brought
into
the
man
head
then
he
thought
of
his
daughter
and
of
her
escape
a
soft
light
came
into
his
eyes
he
was
happy
but
when
he
had
partially
undressed
a
new
mood
came
and
he
turned
out
the
lights
in
the
room
and
went
again
to
the
window
in
the
room
above
margaret
had
been
unable
to
sleep
and
had
also
crept
to
the
window
she
was
thinking
again
of
mcgregor
and
was
ashamed
of
her
thoughts
by
chance
both
father
and
daughter
began
at
the
same
moment
to
doubt
the
truth
of
what
david
had
said
during
the
drive
along
the
boulevard
margaret
could
not
express
her
doubts
in
words
but
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
for
david
he
put
his
hand
on
the
sill
of
the
window
and
for
just
a
moment
his
body
trembled
as
with
age
and
weariness
i
wonder
he
muttered
if
i
had
youth
perhaps
mcgregor
knew
he
would
fail
and
yet
had
the
courage
of
failure
i
wonder
if
both
margaret
and
myself
lack
the
greater
courage
if
that
evening
long
ago
when
i
walked
under
the
trees
i
made
a
mistake
what
if
after
all
this
mcgregor
and
his
woman
knew
both
roads
what
if
they
after
looking
deliberately
along
the
road
toward
success
in
life
went
without
regret
along
the
road
to
failure
what
if
mcgregor
and
not
myself
knew
the
road
to
beauty
end
