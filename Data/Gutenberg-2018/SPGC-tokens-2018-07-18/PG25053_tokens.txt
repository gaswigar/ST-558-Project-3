chapter
i
a
holy
saint
it
is
in
the
thebaïd
on
the
heights
of
a
mountain
where
a
platform
shaped
like
a
crescent
is
surrounded
by
huge
stones
the
hermit
cell
occupies
the
background
it
is
built
of
mud
and
reeds
and
doorless
inside
are
seen
a
pitcher
and
a
loaf
of
black
bread
in
the
centre
on
a
wooden
support
a
large
book
on
the
ground
here
and
there
bits
of
a
mat
or
two
a
basket
and
a
knife
some
ten
paces
or
so
from
the
cell
a
tall
cross
is
planted
in
the
ground
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
platform
a
gnarled
old
leans
over
the
abyss
for
the
side
of
the
mountain
is
scarped
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
the
nile
swells
as
it
were
into
a
lake
to
right
and
left
the
view
is
bounded
by
the
enclosing
rocks
but
on
the
side
of
the
desert
immense
undulations
of
a
yellowish
rise
one
above
and
one
beyond
the
other
like
the
lines
of
a
while
far
off
beyond
the
sands
the
mountains
of
the
libyan
range
form
a
wall
of
whiteness
faintly
shaded
with
violet
haze
in
front
the
sun
is
going
down
towards
the
north
the
sky
has
a
tint
while
at
the
zenith
purple
clouds
like
the
tufts
of
a
gigantic
mane
stretch
over
the
blue
vault
these
purple
streaks
grow
browner
the
patches
of
blue
assume
the
paleness
of
the
bushes
the
pebbles
the
earth
now
wear
the
hard
colour
of
bronze
and
through
space
floats
a
golden
dust
so
fine
that
it
is
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
vibrations
of
light
saint
antony
who
has
a
long
beard
unshorn
locks
and
a
tunic
of
goatskin
is
seated
engaged
in
making
mats
no
sooner
has
the
sun
disappeared
than
he
heaves
a
deep
sigh
and
gazing
towards
the
horizon
another
day
another
day
gone
i
was
not
so
miserable
in
former
times
as
i
am
now
before
the
night
was
over
i
used
to
begin
my
prayers
then
i
would
go
down
to
the
river
to
fetch
water
and
would
reascend
the
rough
mountain
pathway
singing
a
hymn
with
the
on
my
shoulder
after
that
i
used
to
amuse
myself
by
arranging
everything
in
my
cell
i
used
to
take
up
my
tools
and
examine
the
mats
to
see
whether
they
were
evenly
cut
and
the
baskets
to
see
whether
they
were
light
for
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
even
my
most
trifling
acts
were
duties
which
i
performed
with
ease
at
regulated
hours
i
left
off
my
work
and
prayed
with
my
two
arms
extended
i
felt
as
if
a
fountain
of
mercy
were
flowing
from
heaven
above
into
my
heart
but
now
it
is
dried
up
why
is
this
he
proceeds
slowly
into
the
rocky
enclosure
when
i
left
home
everyone
found
fault
with
me
my
mother
sank
into
a
dying
state
my
sister
from
a
distance
made
signs
to
me
to
come
back
and
the
other
one
wept
ammonaria
that
child
whom
i
used
to
meet
every
evening
beside
the
cistern
as
she
was
leading
away
her
cattle
she
ran
after
me
the
rings
on
her
feet
glittered
in
the
dust
and
her
tunic
open
at
the
hips
fluttered
in
the
wind
the
old
ascetic
who
hurried
me
from
the
spot
addressed
her
as
we
fled
in
loud
and
menacing
tones
then
our
two
camels
kept
galloping
continuously
till
at
length
every
familiar
object
had
vanished
from
my
sight
at
first
i
selected
for
my
abode
the
tomb
of
one
of
the
pharaohs
but
some
enchantment
surrounds
those
subterranean
palaces
amid
whose
gloom
the
air
is
stifled
with
the
decayed
odour
of
aromatics
from
the
depths
of
the
sarcophagi
i
heard
a
mournful
voice
arise
that
called
me
by
name
or
rather
as
it
seemed
to
me
all
the
fearful
pictures
on
the
walls
started
into
hideous
life
then
i
fled
to
the
borders
of
the
red
sea
into
a
citadel
in
ruins
there
i
had
for
companions
the
scorpions
that
crawled
amongst
the
stones
and
overhead
the
eagles
who
were
continually
whirling
across
the
azure
sky
at
night
i
was
torn
by
talons
bitten
by
beaks
or
brushed
with
light
wings
and
horrible
demons
yelling
in
my
ears
hurled
me
to
the
earth
at
last
the
drivers
of
a
caravan
which
was
journeying
towards
alexandria
rescued
me
and
carried
me
along
with
them
after
this
i
became
a
pupil
of
the
venerable
didymus
though
he
was
blind
no
one
equalled
him
in
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
when
our
lesson
was
ended
he
used
to
take
my
arm
and
with
my
aid
ascend
the
panium
from
whose
summit
could
be
seen
the
pharos
and
the
open
sea
then
we
would
return
home
passing
along
the
quays
where
we
brushed
against
men
of
every
nation
including
the
cimmerians
clad
in
bearskin
and
the
gymnosophists
of
the
ganges
who
smear
their
bodies
with
there
were
continual
conflicts
in
the
streets
some
of
which
were
caused
by
the
jews
refusal
to
pay
taxes
and
others
by
the
attempts
of
the
seditious
to
drive
out
the
romans
besides
the
city
is
filled
with
heretics
the
followers
of
manes
of
valentinus
of
basilides
and
of
arius
all
of
them
eagerly
striving
to
discuss
with
you
points
of
doctrine
and
to
convert
you
to
their
views
their
discourses
sometimes
come
back
to
my
memory
and
though
i
try
not
to
dwell
upon
them
they
haunt
my
thoughts
i
next
took
refuge
in
colzin
and
when
i
had
undergone
a
severe
penance
i
no
longer
feared
the
wrath
of
god
many
persons
gathered
around
me
offering
to
become
anchorites
i
imposed
on
them
a
rule
of
life
in
antagonism
to
the
vagaries
of
gnosticism
and
the
sophistries
of
the
philosophers
communications
now
reached
me
from
every
quarter
and
people
came
a
great
distance
to
see
me
meanwhile
the
populace
continued
to
torture
the
confessors
and
i
was
led
back
to
alexandria
by
an
ardent
thirst
for
martyrdom
i
found
on
my
arrival
that
the
persecution
had
ceased
three
days
before
just
as
i
was
returning
my
path
was
blocked
by
a
great
crowd
in
front
of
the
temple
of
serapis
i
was
told
that
the
governor
was
about
to
make
one
final
example
in
the
centre
of
the
portico
in
the
broad
light
of
day
a
naked
woman
was
fastened
to
a
pillar
while
two
soldiers
were
scourging
her
at
each
stroke
her
entire
frame
writhed
suddenly
she
cast
a
wild
look
around
her
trembling
lips
parted
and
above
the
heads
of
the
multitude
her
figure
wrapped
as
it
were
in
her
flowing
hair
methought
i
recognised
ammonaria
yet
this
one
was
taller
and
beautiful
exceedingly
he
draws
his
hand
across
his
brow
no
no
i
must
not
think
upon
it
on
another
occasion
athanasius
asked
me
to
assist
him
against
the
arians
at
that
time
they
had
confined
themselves
to
attacking
him
with
invectives
and
ridicule
since
then
however
he
has
been
calumniated
deprived
of
his
see
and
banished
where
is
he
now
i
know
not
people
concern
themselves
so
little
about
bringing
me
any
news
all
my
disciples
have
abandoned
me
hilarion
like
the
rest
he
was
perhaps
fifteen
years
of
age
when
he
came
to
me
and
his
mind
was
so
much
filled
with
curiosity
that
every
moment
he
was
asking
me
questions
then
he
would
listen
with
a
pensive
air
and
without
a
murmur
he
would
run
to
fetch
whatever
i
wanted
more
nimble
than
a
kid
and
gay
enough
moreover
to
make
even
a
patriarch
laugh
he
was
a
son
to
me
the
sky
is
red
the
earth
completely
dark
agitated
by
the
wind
clouds
of
sand
rise
like
and
then
fall
again
all
at
once
in
a
clear
space
in
the
heavens
a
flock
of
birds
flits
by
forming
a
kind
of
triangular
battalion
resembling
a
piece
of
metal
with
its
edges
alone
vibrating
antony
glances
at
them
ah
how
i
should
like
to
follow
them
how
often
too
have
i
not
wistfully
gazed
at
the
long
boats
with
their
sails
resembling
wings
especially
when
they
bore
away
those
who
had
been
my
guests
what
happy
times
i
used
to
have
with
them
what
outpourings
none
of
them
interested
me
more
than
ammon
he
described
to
me
his
journey
to
rome
the
catacombs
the
coliseum
the
piety
of
illustrious
women
and
a
thousand
other
things
and
yet
i
was
unwilling
to
go
away
with
him
how
came
i
to
be
so
obstinate
in
clinging
to
this
solitary
life
it
might
have
been
better
for
me
had
i
stayed
with
the
monks
of
nitria
when
they
besought
me
to
do
so
they
occupy
separate
cells
and
yet
communicate
with
one
another
on
sunday
the
trumpet
calls
them
to
the
church
where
you
may
see
three
whips
hung
up
which
are
reserved
for
the
punishment
of
thieves
and
intruders
for
they
maintain
very
severe
discipline
nevertheless
they
do
not
stand
in
need
of
gifts
for
the
faithful
bring
them
eggs
fruit
and
even
instruments
for
removing
thorns
from
their
feet
there
are
vineyards
around
pisperi
and
those
of
pabenum
have
a
raft
in
which
they
go
forth
to
seek
provisions
but
i
should
have
served
my
brethren
more
effectually
by
being
a
simple
priest
i
might
succour
the
poor
administer
the
sacraments
and
guard
the
purity
of
domestic
life
besides
all
the
laity
are
not
lost
and
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
me
from
being
for
example
a
grammarian
or
a
philosopher
i
should
have
had
in
my
room
a
sphere
made
of
reeds
tablets
always
in
my
hand
young
people
around
me
and
a
crown
of
laurel
suspended
as
an
emblem
over
my
door
but
there
is
too
much
pride
in
such
triumphs
better
be
a
soldier
i
was
strong
and
courageous
enough
to
manage
engines
of
war
to
traverse
gloomy
forests
or
with
helmet
on
head
to
enter
smoking
cities
more
than
this
there
would
be
nothing
to
hinder
me
from
purchasing
with
my
earnings
the
office
of
of
some
bridge
and
travellers
would
relate
to
me
their
histories
pointing
out
to
me
heaps
of
curious
objects
which
they
had
stowed
away
in
their
baggage
on
festival
days
the
merchants
of
alexandria
sail
along
the
canopic
branch
of
the
nile
and
drink
wine
from
cups
of
lotus
to
the
sound
of
tambourines
which
make
all
the
taverns
near
the
river
shake
beyond
trees
cut
protect
the
peaceful
farmsteads
against
the
south
wind
the
roof
of
each
house
rests
on
slender
columns
running
close
to
one
another
like
the
framework
of
a
lattice
and
through
these
spaces
the
owner
stretched
on
a
long
seat
can
gaze
out
upon
his
grounds
and
watch
his
servants
thrashing
corn
or
gathering
in
the
vintage
and
the
cattle
trampling
on
the
straw
his
children
play
along
the
grass
his
wife
bends
forward
to
kiss
him
through
the
deepening
shadows
of
the
night
pointed
snouts
reveal
themselves
here
and
there
with
ears
erect
and
glittering
eyes
antony
advances
towards
them
scattering
the
wind
in
their
wild
rush
the
animals
take
flight
it
was
a
troop
of
jackals
one
of
them
remains
behind
and
resting
on
two
paws
with
his
body
bent
and
his
head
on
one
side
he
places
himself
in
an
attitude
of
defiance
how
pretty
he
looks
i
should
like
to
pass
my
hand
softly
over
his
back
antony
whistles
to
make
him
come
near
the
jackal
disappears
ah
he
is
gone
to
join
his
fellows
oh
this
solitude
this
weariness
laughing
bitterly
this
is
such
a
delightful
life
to
twist
palm
branches
in
the
fire
to
make
shepherds
crooks
to
turn
out
baskets
and
fasten
mats
together
and
then
to
exchange
all
this
handiwork
with
the
nomads
for
bread
that
breaks
your
teeth
ah
wretched
me
will
there
never
be
an
end
of
this
but
indeed
death
would
be
better
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
enough
enough
he
stamps
his
foot
and
makes
his
way
through
the
rocks
with
rapid
step
then
stops
out
of
breath
bursts
into
sobs
and
flings
himself
upon
the
ground
the
night
is
calm
millions
of
stars
are
trembling
in
the
sky
no
sound
is
heard
save
the
chattering
of
the
tarantula
the
two
arms
of
the
cross
cast
a
shadow
on
the
sand
antony
who
is
weeping
perceives
it
am
i
so
weak
my
god
courage
let
us
arise
he
enters
his
cell
finds
there
the
embers
of
a
fire
lights
a
torch
and
places
it
on
the
wooden
stand
so
as
to
illumine
the
big
book
suppose
i
take
the
of
the
apostles
yes
no
matter
where
saw
the
sky
opened
with
a
great
linen
sheet
which
was
let
down
by
its
four
corners
wherein
were
all
kinds
of
terrestrial
animals
and
wild
beasts
reptiles
and
birds
and
a
voice
said
to
him
arise
peter
kill
and
eat
so
then
the
lord
wished
that
his
apostle
should
eat
every
kind
of
food
whilst
i
antony
lets
his
chin
sink
on
his
breast
the
rustling
of
the
pages
which
the
wind
scatters
causes
him
to
lift
his
head
and
he
reads
jews
slew
all
their
enemies
with
swords
and
made
a
great
carnage
of
them
so
that
they
disposed
at
will
of
those
whom
they
there
follows
the
enumeration
of
the
people
slain
by
them
thousand
they
had
endured
so
much
besides
their
enemies
were
the
enemies
of
the
true
god
and
how
they
must
have
enjoyed
their
vengeance
completely
slaughtering
the
idolaters
no
doubt
the
city
was
gorged
with
the
dead
they
must
have
been
at
the
garden
gates
on
the
staircases
and
packed
so
closely
together
in
the
various
rooms
that
the
doors
could
not
be
closed
but
here
am
i
plunging
into
thoughts
of
murder
and
bloodshed
he
opens
the
book
at
another
passage
prostrated
himself
with
his
face
on
the
ground
and
adored
ah
that
is
good
the
most
high
exalts
his
prophets
above
kings
this
monarch
spent
his
life
in
feasting
always
intoxicated
with
sensuality
and
pride
but
god
to
punish
him
changed
him
into
a
beast
and
he
walked
on
four
paws
antony
begins
to
laugh
and
while
stretching
out
his
arms
disarranges
the
leaves
of
the
book
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
then
his
eyes
fall
on
these
words
felt
great
joy
in
coming
to
them
he
showed
them
his
perfumes
his
gold
and
silver
all
his
aromatics
his
oils
all
his
precious
vases
and
the
things
that
were
in
his
i
can
imagine
how
they
beheld
heaped
up
to
the
very
ceiling
gems
diamonds
darics
a
man
who
possesses
such
an
accumulation
of
these
things
is
not
the
same
as
others
while
handling
them
he
assumes
that
he
holds
the
result
of
innumerable
exertions
and
that
he
has
absorbed
and
can
again
diffuse
the
very
life
of
the
people
this
is
a
useful
precaution
for
kings
the
wisest
of
them
all
was
not
wanting
in
it
his
fleets
brought
him
ivory
and
apes
where
is
this
it
is
he
rapidly
turns
over
the
leaves
ah
this
is
the
place
queen
of
sheba
being
aware
of
the
glory
of
solomon
came
to
tempt
him
propounding
how
did
she
hope
to
tempt
him
the
devil
was
very
desirous
to
tempt
jesus
but
jesus
triumphed
because
he
was
god
and
solomon
owing
perhaps
to
his
magical
science
it
is
sublime
this
science
for
as
a
philosopher
has
explained
to
me
the
world
forms
a
whole
all
whose
parts
have
an
influence
on
one
another
like
the
different
organs
of
a
single
body
it
is
interesting
to
understand
the
affinities
and
antipathies
implanted
in
everything
by
nature
and
then
to
put
them
into
play
in
this
way
one
might
be
able
to
modify
laws
that
appear
to
be
unchangeable
at
this
point
the
two
shadows
traced
behind
him
by
the
arms
of
the
cross
project
themselves
in
front
of
him
they
form
as
it
were
two
great
horns
antony
exclaims
help
my
god
the
shadows
resume
their
former
position
ah
it
was
an
illusion
nothing
more
it
is
useless
for
me
to
torment
my
soul
i
have
no
need
to
do
so
absolutely
no
need
he
sits
down
and
crosses
his
arms
and
yet
methought
i
felt
the
approach
but
why
should
come
besides
do
i
not
know
his
artifices
i
have
repelled
the
monstrous
anchorite
who
with
a
laugh
offered
me
little
hot
loaves
the
centaur
who
tried
to
take
me
on
his
back
and
that
vision
of
a
beautiful
dusky
maid
amid
the
sands
which
revealed
itself
to
me
as
the
spirit
of
voluptuousness
antony
walks
up
and
down
rapidly
it
is
by
my
direction
that
all
these
holy
retreats
have
been
built
full
of
monks
wearing
beneath
their
goatskins
and
numerous
enough
to
furnish
forth
an
army
i
have
healed
diseases
at
a
distance
i
have
banished
demons
i
have
waded
through
the
river
in
the
midst
of
crocodiles
the
emperor
constantine
has
written
me
three
letters
and
balacius
who
treated
with
contempt
the
letter
i
sent
him
has
been
torn
by
his
own
horses
the
people
of
alexandria
whenever
i
reappeared
amongst
them
fought
to
get
a
glimpse
of
me
and
athanasius
was
my
guide
when
i
took
my
departure
but
what
toils
too
i
have
had
to
undergo
here
for
more
than
thirty
years
have
i
been
constantly
groaning
in
the
desert
i
have
carried
on
my
loins
eighty
pounds
of
bronze
like
eusebius
i
have
exposed
my
body
to
the
stings
of
insects
like
macarius
i
have
remained
nights
without
closing
an
eye
like
pachomius
and
those
who
are
decapitated
torn
with
pincers
or
burnt
possess
less
virtue
perhaps
inasmuch
as
my
life
is
a
continual
martyrdom
antony
slackens
his
pace
certainly
there
is
no
one
who
undergoes
so
much
mortification
charitable
hearts
are
growing
fewer
and
people
never
give
me
anything
now
my
cloak
is
worn
out
and
i
have
no
sandals
nor
even
a
porringer
for
i
gave
all
my
goods
and
chattels
to
the
poor
and
my
own
family
without
keeping
a
single
obolus
for
myself
should
i
not
need
a
little
money
to
get
the
tools
that
are
indispensable
for
my
work
oh
not
much
a
little
sum
i
would
husband
it
the
fathers
of
nicæa
were
ranged
in
purple
robes
on
thrones
along
the
wall
like
the
magi
and
they
were
entertained
at
a
banquet
while
honours
were
heaped
upon
them
especially
on
paphnutius
merely
because
he
has
lost
an
eye
and
is
lame
since
dioclesian
persecution
many
a
time
the
emperor
has
kissed
his
injured
eye
what
folly
moreover
the
council
had
such
worthless
members
theophilus
a
bishop
of
scythia
john
another
in
persia
spiridion
a
alexander
was
too
old
athanasius
ought
to
have
made
himself
more
agreeable
to
the
arians
in
order
to
get
concessions
from
them
how
is
it
they
dealt
with
me
they
would
not
even
give
me
a
hearing
he
who
spoke
against
me
a
tall
young
man
with
a
curling
beard
coolly
launched
out
captious
objections
and
while
i
was
trying
to
find
words
to
reply
to
him
they
kept
looking
at
me
with
malignant
glances
barking
at
me
like
hyenas
ah
if
i
could
only
get
them
all
sent
into
exile
by
the
emperor
or
rather
smite
them
crush
them
behold
them
suffering
i
have
much
to
suffer
myself
he
sinks
swooning
against
the
wall
of
his
cell
this
is
what
it
is
to
have
fasted
overmuch
my
strength
is
going
if
i
had
eaten
only
once
a
morsel
of
meat
he
his
eyes
languidly
ah
for
some
red
flesh
a
bunch
of
grapes
to
nibble
some
curds
that
would
quiver
on
a
plate
but
what
ails
me
now
what
ails
me
now
i
feel
my
heart
dilating
like
the
sea
when
it
swells
before
the
storm
an
overwhelming
weakness
bows
me
down
and
the
warm
atmosphere
seems
to
waft
towards
me
the
odour
of
hair
still
there
is
no
trace
of
a
woman
here
he
turns
towards
the
little
pathway
amid
the
rocks
this
is
the
way
they
come
poised
in
their
litters
on
the
black
arms
of
eunuchs
they
descend
and
joining
together
their
hands
laden
with
rings
they
kneel
down
they
tell
me
their
troubles
the
need
of
a
superhuman
voluptuousness
tortures
them
they
would
like
to
die
in
their
dreams
they
have
seen
gods
who
called
them
by
name
and
the
edges
of
their
robes
fall
round
my
feet
i
repel
them
no
they
say
to
me
yet
what
must
i
do
any
penance
will
appear
easy
to
them
they
ask
me
for
the
most
severe
to
share
in
my
own
to
live
with
me
it
is
a
long
time
now
since
i
have
seen
any
of
them
perhaps
though
this
is
what
is
about
to
happen
and
why
not
if
suddenly
i
were
to
hear
the
ringing
in
the
mountains
it
seems
to
me
antony
climbs
upon
a
rock
at
the
entrance
of
the
path
and
bends
forward
darting
his
eyes
into
the
darkness
yes
down
there
at
the
very
end
there
is
a
moving
mass
like
people
who
are
trying
to
pick
their
way
here
it
is
they
are
making
a
mistake
calling
out
on
this
side
come
come
the
echo
repeats
come
come
he
lets
his
arms
fall
down
quite
dazed
what
a
shame
ah
poor
antony
and
immediately
he
hears
a
whisper
poor
antony
is
that
anyone
answer
it
is
the
wind
passing
through
the
spaces
between
the
rocks
that
causes
these
intonations
and
in
their
confused
sonorities
he
distinguishes
voices
as
if
the
air
were
speaking
they
are
low
and
insinuating
a
kind
of
sibilant
utterance
do
you
wish
for
women
nay
rather
great
piles
of
money
a
shining
sword
all
the
people
admire
you
go
to
sleep
you
will
cut
their
throats
yes
you
will
cut
their
throats
at
the
same
time
visible
objects
undergo
a
transformation
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
the
old
with
its
cluster
of
yellow
leaves
becomes
the
torso
of
a
woman
leaning
over
the
abyss
and
poised
by
her
mass
of
hair
antony
his
cell
and
the
stool
which
sustains
the
big
book
with
its
pages
filled
with
black
letters
seems
to
him
a
bush
covered
with
swallows
without
doubt
it
is
the
torch
that
is
making
this
play
of
light
let
us
put
it
out
he
puts
it
out
and
finds
himself
in
profound
darkness
and
suddenly
through
the
midst
of
the
air
passes
first
a
pool
of
water
then
a
prostitute
the
corner
of
a
temple
a
figure
of
a
soldier
and
a
chariot
with
two
white
horses
prancing
these
images
make
their
appearance
abruptly
in
successive
shocks
standing
out
from
the
darkness
like
pictures
of
scarlet
above
a
background
of
ebony
their
motion
becomes
more
rapid
they
pass
in
a
dizzy
fashion
at
other
times
they
stop
and
growing
pale
by
degrees
dissolve
or
rather
they
fly
away
and
instantly
others
arrive
in
their
stead
antony
droops
his
eyelids
they
multiply
surround
besiege
him
an
unspeakable
terror
seizes
hold
of
him
and
he
no
longer
has
any
sensation
but
that
of
a
burning
contraction
in
the
epigastrium
in
spite
of
the
confusion
of
his
brain
he
is
conscious
of
a
tremendous
silence
which
separates
him
from
all
the
world
he
tries
to
speak
impossible
it
is
as
if
the
link
that
bound
him
to
existence
was
snapped
and
making
no
further
resistance
antony
falls
upon
the
mat
chapter
ii
the
temptation
of
love
and
power
then
a
great
shadow
more
subtle
than
an
ordinary
shadow
from
whose
borders
other
shadows
hang
in
festoons
traces
itself
upon
the
ground
it
is
the
devil
resting
against
the
roof
of
the
cell
and
carrying
under
his
wings
like
a
gigantic
bat
that
is
suckling
its
young
the
seven
deadly
sins
whose
grinning
heads
disclose
themselves
confusedly
antony
his
eyes
still
closed
remains
languidly
passive
and
stretches
his
limbs
upon
the
mat
which
seems
to
him
to
grow
softer
every
moment
until
it
swells
out
and
becomes
a
bed
then
the
bed
becomes
a
shallop
with
water
rippling
against
its
sides
to
right
and
left
rise
up
two
necks
of
black
soil
that
tower
above
the
cultivated
plains
with
a
sycamore
here
and
there
a
noise
of
bells
drums
and
singers
resounds
at
a
distance
these
are
caused
by
people
who
are
going
down
from
canopus
to
sleep
at
the
temple
of
serapis
antony
is
aware
of
this
and
he
glides
driven
by
the
wind
between
the
two
banks
of
the
canal
the
leaves
of
the
papyrus
and
the
red
blossoms
of
the
larger
than
a
man
bend
over
him
he
lies
extended
at
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
an
oar
from
behind
drags
through
the
water
from
time
to
time
rises
a
hot
breath
of
air
that
shakes
the
thin
reeds
the
murmur
of
the
tiny
waves
grows
fainter
a
drowsiness
takes
possession
of
him
he
dreams
that
he
is
an
egyptian
solitary
then
he
starts
up
all
of
a
sudden
have
i
been
dreaming
it
was
so
pleasant
that
i
doubted
its
reality
my
tongue
is
burning
i
am
thirsty
he
enters
his
cell
and
searches
about
everywhere
at
random
the
ground
is
wet
has
it
been
raining
stop
scraps
of
food
my
pitcher
broken
but
the
he
finds
it
empty
completely
empty
in
order
to
get
down
to
the
river
i
should
need
three
hours
at
least
and
the
night
is
so
dark
i
could
not
see
well
enough
to
find
my
way
there
my
entrails
are
writhing
where
is
the
bread
after
searching
for
some
time
he
picks
up
a
crust
smaller
than
an
egg
how
is
this
the
jackals
must
have
taken
it
curse
them
and
he
flings
the
bread
furiously
upon
the
ground
this
movement
is
scarcely
completed
when
a
table
presents
itself
to
view
covered
with
all
kinds
of
dainties
the
of
byssus
striated
like
the
fillets
of
sphinxes
seems
to
unfold
itself
in
luminous
undulations
upon
it
there
are
enormous
quarters
of
huge
fishes
birds
with
their
feathers
quadrupeds
with
their
hair
fruits
with
an
almost
natural
colouring
and
pieces
of
white
ice
and
flagons
of
violet
crystal
shed
glowing
reflections
in
the
middle
of
the
table
antony
observes
a
wild
boar
smoking
from
all
its
pores
its
paws
beneath
its
belly
its
eyes
and
the
idea
of
being
able
to
eat
this
formidable
animal
rejoices
his
heart
exceedingly
then
there
are
things
he
had
never
seen
before
black
hashes
jellies
of
the
colour
of
gold
ragoûts
in
which
mushrooms
float
like
on
the
surface
of
a
pool
whipped
creams
so
light
that
they
resemble
clouds
and
the
aroma
of
all
this
brings
to
him
the
odour
of
the
ocean
the
coolness
of
fountains
the
mighty
perfume
of
woods
he
dilates
his
nostrils
as
much
as
possible
he
drivels
saying
to
himself
that
there
is
enough
there
to
last
for
a
year
for
ten
years
for
his
whole
life
in
proportion
as
he
fixes
his
eyes
upon
the
dishes
others
accumulate
forming
a
pyramid
whose
angles
turn
downwards
the
wines
begin
to
flow
the
fishes
to
palpitate
the
blood
in
the
dishes
bubbles
up
the
pulp
of
the
fruits
draws
nearer
like
amorous
lips
and
the
table
rises
to
his
breast
to
his
very
chin
with
only
one
seat
and
one
cover
which
are
exactly
in
front
of
him
he
is
about
to
seize
the
loaf
of
bread
other
loaves
make
their
appearance
for
me
all
but
antony
draws
back
in
the
place
of
the
one
which
was
there
here
are
others
it
is
a
miracle
then
exactly
like
that
the
lord
performed
with
what
object
nay
all
the
rest
of
it
is
not
less
incomprehensible
ah
demon
begone
begone
he
gives
a
kick
to
the
table
it
disappears
nothing
more
no
he
draws
a
long
breath
ah
the
temptation
was
strong
but
what
an
escape
i
have
had
he
raises
up
his
head
and
stumbles
against
an
object
which
emits
a
sound
what
can
this
be
antony
stoops
down
hold
a
cup
someone
must
have
lost
it
while
travelling
nothing
extraordinary
he
wets
his
finger
and
rubs
it
glitters
precious
metal
however
i
can
not
distinguish
he
lights
his
torch
and
examines
the
cup
it
is
made
of
silver
adorned
with
ovolos
at
its
rim
with
a
medal
at
the
bottom
he
makes
the
medal
resound
with
a
touch
of
his
it
is
a
piece
of
money
which
is
worth
from
seven
to
eight
drachmas
not
more
no
matter
i
can
easily
with
that
sum
get
myself
a
sheepskin
the
torch
reflection
lights
up
the
cup
it
is
not
possible
gold
yes
all
gold
he
finds
another
piece
larger
than
the
first
at
the
bottom
and
underneath
that
many
others
why
here
a
sum
large
enough
to
buy
three
cows
a
little
field
the
cup
is
now
filled
with
gold
pieces
come
then
a
hundred
slaves
soldiers
a
heap
wherewith
to
buy
here
the
granulations
of
the
cup
rim
detaching
themselves
form
a
pearl
necklace
with
this
jewel
here
one
might
even
win
the
emperor
wife
with
a
shake
antony
makes
the
necklace
slip
over
his
wrist
he
holds
the
cup
in
his
left
hand
and
with
his
right
arm
raises
the
torch
to
shed
more
light
upon
it
like
water
trickling
down
from
a
basin
it
pours
itself
out
in
continuous
waves
so
as
to
make
a
hillock
on
the
sand
diamonds
carbuncles
and
sapphires
mingled
with
huge
pieces
of
gold
bearing
the
effigies
of
kings
what
what
staters
shekels
darics
aryandics
alexander
demetrius
the
ptolemies
cæsar
but
each
of
them
had
not
as
much
nothing
impossible
in
it
more
to
come
and
those
rays
which
dazzle
me
ah
my
heart
overflows
how
good
this
is
yes
yes
more
never
enough
it
did
not
matter
even
if
i
kept
flinging
it
into
the
sea
more
would
remain
why
lose
any
of
it
i
will
keep
it
all
without
telling
anyone
about
it
i
will
dig
myself
a
chamber
in
the
rock
the
interior
of
which
will
be
lined
with
strips
of
bronze
and
thither
will
i
come
to
feel
the
piles
of
gold
sinking
under
my
heels
i
will
plunge
my
arms
into
it
as
if
into
sacks
of
corn
i
would
like
to
anoint
my
face
with
it
to
sleep
on
top
of
it
he
lets
go
the
torch
in
order
to
embrace
the
heap
and
falls
to
the
ground
on
his
breast
he
gets
up
again
the
place
is
perfectly
empty
what
have
i
done
if
i
died
during
that
brief
space
of
time
the
result
would
have
been
hell
irrevocable
hell
a
shudder
runs
through
his
frame
so
then
i
am
accursed
ah
no
this
is
all
my
own
fault
i
let
myself
be
caught
in
every
trap
there
is
no
one
more
idiotic
or
more
infamous
i
would
like
to
beat
myself
or
rather
to
tear
myself
out
of
my
body
i
have
restrained
myself
too
long
i
need
to
avenge
myself
to
strike
to
kill
it
is
as
if
i
had
a
troop
of
wild
beasts
in
my
soul
i
would
like
with
a
stroke
of
a
hatchet
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
ah
a
dagger
he
flings
himself
upon
his
knife
which
he
has
just
seen
the
knife
slips
from
his
hand
and
antony
remains
propped
against
the
wall
of
his

his

motionless
like

in

trance
all

he
finds
himself
in

on
the
panium
an
artificial
mound
raised
in

with
corkscrew
stairs
on

with

directly
under

an
irregular
succession
of
flat
roofs
traversed
from

from

by
two
streets
which
cross
each

in

a

of

with
corinthian

the

with
a
single
glance
he
takes
in
the
two
ports
the
grand
port
and
the
eunostus
both
round
like
two
circles
and
separated
by
a
mole
joining
alexandria
to
the

a

with

a

may
be
observed
women
stop
in

where

are
at

and
the
grinding
of
frightens
away
some
birds
who
are
picking
up
from

the

over
the

contained
within
the
oval
enclosure
of
the
greyish
walls
under
the
vault
of
the
blue
heavens
hard
by
the
motionless
sea
but
the
crowd
stops
and
looks
towards
the
eastern
side
from
which
enormous
whirlwinds
of
dust
are
advancing
it
is
the
monks
of
the
thebaïd
who
are
coming
clad
in
goats
skins
armed
with
clubs
and
howling
forth
a
canticle
of
war
and
of
religion
with
this
refrain
where
are
they
where
are
they
antony
comprehends
that
they
have
come
to
kill
the
arians
all
at
once
the
streets
are
deserted
and
one
sees
no
longer
anything
but
running
feet
and
now
the
solitaries
are
in
the
city
their
formidable
cudgels
studded
with
nails
whirl
around
like
monstrances
of
steel
one
can
hear
the
crash
of
things
being
broken
in
the
houses
intervals
of
silence
follow
and
then
the
loud
cries
burst
forth
again
from
one
end
of
the
streets
to
the
other
there
is
a
continuous
eddying
of
people
in
a
state
of
terror
several
are
armed
with
pikes
sometimes
two
groups
meet
and
form
into
one
and
this
multitude
after
rushing
along
the
pavements
separates
and
those
composing
it
proceed
to
knock
one
another
down
but
the
men
with
long
hair
always
reappear
thin
wreaths
of
smoke
escape
from
the
corners
of
buildings
the
leaves
of
the

burst
asunder
the
skirts
of
the

fall
in
the
architraves
topple
over
antony
meets
all
his
enemies
one
after
another
he
recognises
people
whom
he
had
forgotten
before
killing
them
he
outrages
them
he
rips
them
open
cuts
their
throats
knocks
them
down
drags
the
old
men
by
their
beards
runs
over

and
beats

themselves
on

those
who

the

the

the

the

a
thousand
dainty
objects
whose
use
they
are
ignorant
of
and
which
for
that
very
reason
exasperate
them
from
time
to
time
they
stop
out
of
breath
and
then
begin
again
the
inhabitants
taking
refuge
in
the
utter
lamentations
the
women
lift
their
eyes
to
heaven
weeping
with
their
arms
bare
in
order
to
move
the
solitaries
they
embrace
their
knees
but
the
latter
only
dash
them
aside
and
the
blood
gushes
up
to
the
ceiling
falls
back
on
the
linen

that
line
the

streams
from
the
trunks
of

fills
the
aqueducts
and
rolls
in
great
red
pools
along
the
ground
antony
is
steeped
in
it
up
to
his
middle
he
steps
into
it
sucks
it
up
with
his
lips
and
quivers
with
joy
at
feeling
it
on
his
limbs
and
under
his
hair
which
is
quite
wet
with
it
the
night
falls
the
terrible
clamour
abates
the
solitaries
have
disappeared
suddenly
on
the
outer
galleries
lining
the
nine
stages
of
the
pharos
antony
perceives
thick
black
lines
as
if
a
flock
of
crows
had
alighted
there
he
hastens
thither
and
soon
finds
himself
on
the
summit
a
huge
copper
mirror
turned
towards
the
sea
reflects
the
ships
in
the
offing
antony
amuses
himself
by
looking
at
them
and
as
he
continues
looking
at
them
their
number
increases
they
are
gathered
in
a
gulf
formed
like
a
crescent
behind
upon
a
promontory
stretches
a
new
city
built
in
the
roman
style
of
architecture
with
cupolas
of
stone
conical
roofs
marble
work
in
red
and
blue
and
a
profusion
of
bronze
attached
to
the
volutes
of
capitals
to
the
tops
of
houses
and
to
the
angles
of
cornices
a
wood
formed
of
overhangs
it
the
colour
of
the
sea
is
greener
the
air
is
colder
on
the
mountains
at
the
horizon
there
is
snow
antony
is
about
to
pursue
his
way
when
a
man
accosts
him
and
says
come
they
are
waiting
for
you
he
traverses
a
forum
enters
a
stoops
under
a
gate
and
he
arrives
before
the
front
of
the
palace
adorned
with
a
group
in
wax
representing
the
emperor
constantine
hurling
the
dragon
to
the
earth
a
porphyry
basin
supports
in
its
centre
a
golden
conch
filled
with
his
guide
informs
him
that
he
may
take
some
of
them
he
does
so
then
he
loses
himself
as
it
were
in
a
succession
of
apartments
along
the
walls
may
be
seen
in
mosaic
generals
offering
conquered
cities
to
the
emperor
on
the
palms
of
their
hands
and
on
every
side
are
columns
of
basalt
gratings
of
silver
filigree
seats
of
ivory
and
tapestries
embroidered
with
pearls
the
light
falls
from
the
vaulted
roof
and
antony
proceeds
on
his
way
tepid
exhalations
spread
around
occasionally
he
hears
the
modest
patter
of
a
sandal
posted
in
the
the
custodians
who
resemble
automatons
bear
on
their
shoulders
truncheons
at
last
he
finds
himself
in
the
lower
part
of
a
hall
with
hyacinth
curtains
at
its
extreme
end
they
divide
and
reveal
the
emperor
seated
upon
a
throne
attired
in
a
violet
tunic
and
red
buskins
with
black
bands
a
diadem
of
pearls
is
wreathed
around
his
hair
which
is
arranged
in
symmetrical
rolls
he
has
drooping
eyelids
a
straight
nose
and
a
heavy
and
cunning
expression
of
countenance
at
the
corners
of
the
daïs
extended
above
his
head
are
placed
four
golden
doves
and
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
two
enamelled
lions
are
squatted
the
doves
begin
to
coo
the
lions
to
roar
the
emperor
rolls
his
eyes
antony
steps
forward
and
directly
without
preamble
they
proceed
with
a
narrative
of
events
illustration
in
the
cities
of
antioch
ephesus
and
alexandria
the
temples
have
been
pillaged
and
the
statues
of
the
gods
converted
into
pots
and
the
emperor
laughs
heartily
at
this
antony
reproaches
him
for
his
tolerance
towards
the
novatians
but
the
emperor
flies
into
a
passion
novatians
arians
meletians
he
is
sick
of
them
all
however
he
admires
the
episcopacy
for
the
christians
create
bishops
who
depend
on
five
or
six
personages
and
it
is
his
interest
to
gain
over
the
latter
in
order
to
have
the
rest
on
his
side
moreover
he
has
not
failed
to
furnish
them
with
considerable
sums
but
he
detests
the
fathers
of
the
council
of
nicæa
come
let
us
have
a
look
at
them
antony
follows
him
and
they
are
found
on
the
same
floor
under
a
terrace
which
commands
a
view
of
a
hippodrome
full
of
people
and
surmounted
by
porticoes
wherein
the
rest
of
the
crowd
are
walking
to
and
fro
in
the
centre
of
the
course
there
is
a
narrow
platform
on
which
stands
a
miniature
temple
of
mercury
a
statue
of
constantine
and
three
bronze
serpents
intertwined
with
each
other
while
at
one
end
there
are
three
huge
wooden
eggs
and
at
the
other
seven
dolphins
with
their
tails
in
the
air
behind
the
imperial
pavilion
the
prefects
of
the
chambers
the
lords
of
the
household
and
the
patricians
are
placed
at
intervals
as
far
as
the
first
story
of
a
church
all
whose
windows
are
lined
with
women
at
the
right
is
the
gallery
of
the
blue
faction
at
the
left
that
of
the
green
while
below
there
is
a
picket
of
soldiers
and
on
a
level
with
the
arena
a
row
of
corinthian
pillars
forming
the
entrance
to
the
stalls
the
races
are
about
to
begin
the
horses
fall
into
line
tall
plumes
fixed
between
their
ears
sway
in
the
wind
like
trees
and
in
their
leaps
they
shake
the
chariots
in
the
form
of
shells
driven
by
coachmen
wearing
a
kind
of
cuirass
with
sleeves
narrow
at
the
wrists
and
wide
in
the
arms
with
legs
uncovered
full
beard
and
hair
shaven
above
the
forehead
after
the
fashion
of
the
huns
antony
is
deafened
by
the
murmuring
of
voices
above
and
below
he
perceives
nothing
but
painted
faces
motley
garments
and
plates
of
worked
gold
and
the
sand
of
the
arena
perfectly
white
shines
like
a
mirror
the
emperor
converses
with
him
confides
to
him
some
important
secrets
informs
him
of
the
assassination
of
his
own
son
crispus
and
goes
so
far
as
to
consult
antony
about
his
health
meanwhile
antony
perceives
slaves
at
the
end
of
the
stalls
they
are
the
fathers
of
the
council
of
nicæa
in
rags
abject
the
martyr
paphnutius
is
brushing
a
horse
mane
theophilus
is
scrubbing
the
legs
of
another
john
is
painting
the
hoofs
of
a
third
while
alexander
is
picking
up
their
droppings
in
a
basket
antony
passes
among
them
they
salaam
to
him
beg
of
him
to
intercede
for
them
and
kiss
his
hands
the
entire
crowd
hoots
at
them
and
he
rejoices
in
their
degradation
immeasurably
and
now
he
has
become
one
of
the
great
ones
of
the
court
the
emperor
confidant
first
minister
constantine
places
the
diadem
on
his
forehead
and
antony
keeps
it
as
if
this
honour
were
quite
natural
to
him
and
presently
is
disclosed
beneath
the
darkness
an
immense
hall
lighted
up
by
candelabra
of
gold
columns
half
lost
in
shadow
so
tall
are
they
run
in
a
row
behind
the
tables
which
stretch
to
the
horizon
where
appear
in
a
luminous
haze
staircases
placed
one
above
another
successions
of
archways
colossi
towers
and
in
the
background
an
unoccupied
wing
of
the
palace
which
cedars
overtop
making
blacker
masses
above
the
darkness
the
guests
crowned
with
violets
lean
upon
their
elbows
on
couches
beside
each
one
are
placed
amphorae
from
which
they
pour
out
wine
and
at
the
very
end
by
himself
adorned
with
the
tiara
and
covered
with
carbuncles
king
nebuchadnezzar
is
eating
and
drinking
to
right
and
left
of
him
two
theories
of
priests
with
peaked
caps
are
swinging
censers
upon
the
ground
are
crawling
captive
kings
without
feet
or
hands
to
whom
he
flings
bones
to
pick
further
down
stand
his
brothers
with
shades
over
their
eyes
for
they
are
perfectly
blind
a
constant
lamentation
ascends
from
the
depths
of
the
ergastula
the
soft
and
monotonous
sounds
of
a
hydraulic
organ
alternate
with
the
chorus
of
voices
and
one
feels
as
if
all
around
the
hall
there
was
an
immense
city
an
ocean
of
humanity
whose
waves
were
beating
against
the
walls
the
slaves
rush
forward
carrying
plates
women
run
about
offering
drink
to
the
guests
the
baskets
groan
under
the
load
of
bread
and
a
dromedary
laden
with
leathern
bottles
passes
to
and
fro
letting
vervain
trickle
over
the
floor
in
order
to
cool
it
belluarii
lead
forth
lions
with
their
hair
in
ringlets
turn
somersaults
while
squirting
fire
through
their
nostrils
perform
tricks
naked
children
fling
snowballs
which
in
falling
crash
against
the
shining
silver
plate
the
clamour
is
so
dreadful
that
it
might
be
described
as
a
tempest
and
the
steam
of
the
viands
as
well
as
the
respirations
of
the
guests
spreads
as
it
were
a
cloud
over
the
feast
now
and
then
flakes
from
the
huge
torches
snatched
away
by
the
wind
traverse
the
night
like
flying
stars
the
king
wipes
off
the
perfumes
from
his
visage
with
his
hand
he
eats
from
the
sacred
vessels
and
then
breaks
them
and
he
enumerates
mentally
his
fleets
his
armies
his
peoples
presently
through
a
whim
he
will
burn
his
palace
along
with
his
guests
he
calculates
on
rebuilding
the
tower
of
babel
and
dethroning
god
antony
reads
at
a
distance
on
his
forehead
all
his
thoughts
they
take
possession
of
himself
and
he
becomes
nebuchadnezzar
immediately
he
is
satiated
with
conquests
and
exterminations
and
a
longing
seizes
him
to
plunge
into
every
kind
of
vileness
moreover
the
degradation
wherewith
men
are
terrified
is
an
outrage
done
to
their
souls
a
means
still
more
of
stupefying
them
and
as
nothing
is
lower
than
a
brute
beast
antony
falls
upon
four
paws
on
the
table
and
bellows
like
a
bull
he
feels
a
pain
in
his
hand
a
pebble
as
it
happened
has
hurt
him
and
he
again
finds
himself
in
his
cell
the
rocky
enclosure
is
empty
the
stars
are
shining
all
is
silence
once
more
i
have
been
deceived
why
these
things
they
arise
from
the
revolts
of
the
flesh
ah
miserable
man
that
i
am
he
dashes
into
his
cell
takes
out
of
it
a
bundle
of
cords
with
iron
nails
at
the
ends
of
them
strips
himself
to
the
waist
and
raising
his
eyes
towards
heaven
accept
my
penance
o
my
god
do
not
despise
it
on
account
of
its
insufficiency
make
it
sharp
prolonged
excessive
it
is
time
to
work
he
proceeds
to
lash
himself
vigorously
ah
no
no
no
pity
he
begins
again
oh
oh
oh
each
stroke
tears
my
skin
cuts
my
limbs
this
smarts
horribly
ah
it
is
not
so
terrible
one
gets
used
to
it
it
seems
to
me
even
antony
stops
come
on
then
coward
come
on
then
good
good
on
the
arms
on
the
back
on
the
breast
against
the
belly
everywhere
hiss
thongs
bite
me
tear
me
i
would
like
the
drops
of
my
blood
to
gush
forth
to
the
stars
to
break
my
back
to
strip
my
nerves

fastened
to
the
pillar
next
to
yours
face

face
with
you
under
your
very
eyes
responding
to
your
shrieks
with
my
sighs

and
our
souls

commingle

are
like
kisses
my
marrow
is
melting
i

dying
and
in

of
him
he
sees
three
cavaliers
mounted
on
wild
asses
clad
in
green
garments
holding
lilies
in
their
hands
and
all
resembling
one
another
in
figure

turns
back
and
sees
three
other
cavaliers
of
the
same
kind
mounted
on
similar
wild
asses
in
the

attitude
he
draws
back
then
the
wild
asses
all
at
the
same
time
step
forward
a
pace
or
two
and
rub
their
snouts
against
him
trying
to
bite
his
garment
voices
exclaim
this
way
this
way
here
is
the
place
and
banners
appear
between
the
clefts
of
the
mountain
with
camels
heads
in
halters
of
red
silk
mules
laden
with
baggage
and
women
covered
with
yellow
veils

astride
on

themselves
on
the
bales
of
goods

out
the
variegated
carpets
and
strew
the
ground
with
glittering
objects
a
white
elephant
caparisoned
with
a
fillet
of
gold
runs
along
shaking
the
bouquet
of
ostrich
feathers
attached
to
his
on
his
back
lying
on
cushions
of
blue
wool
with
eyelids
and

a
woman
so
magnificently
attired
that
she
emits
rays
around
her
the
attendants
prostrate
themselves
the
elephant
bends
his
knees
and
the
queen
of
sheba
gliding
down
by
his
shoulder
steps
lightly
on
the
carpet
and
advances
towards
antony
her
robe
of
gold
brocade
regularly
divided
by
furbelows
of
pearls
jet
and
sapphires
is
drawn
tightly
round
her
waist
by
a
corsage
set
off
with
a
variety
of
colours
representing
the
twelve
signs
of
the
zodiac
she
wears
pattens
one
of
which
is
black
and
strewn
with
silver
stars
and
a
crescent
whilst
the
other
is
white
and
is
covered
with
drops
of
gold
with
a
sun
in

loose
sleeves
garnished
with
emeralds
and
birds

exposes
to

little
rounded
arms
adorned
at
the
wrists
with
bracelets
of
ebony
and
her
hands
covered
with
rings

terminated
by
nails
so
pointed
that
the
ends
of
her
fingers
are
almost
like
needles
a
chain
of
plate
gold
passing
under
her
chin
runs
along
her
cheeks
till
it
twists
itself
in
spiral
fashion
around
her
head
over
which
blue
powder
is
scattered
then
descending
it
slips
over
her
shoulders
and
is
fastened
above
her
bosom
by
a
diamond
scorpion
which
stretches
out
its
tongue
between
her
breasts
from
her
ears
hang
two
great
white
pearls
the
edges
of
her
eyelids
are
painted
black
on
her
left
she
has
a
natural
brown
spot
and
when
she
opens
her
mouth
she
breathes
with
difficulty
as
if
her
bodice
distressed
her
as
she
comes
forward
she
swings
a
green
parasol
with
an
ivory
handle
surrounded
by
vermilion
bells
and
twelve
curly
negro
boys
carry
the
long
train
of
her
robe
the
end
of
which
is
held
by
an
ape
who
raises
it
every
now
and
then
she
says
ah
handsome
hermit
handsome
hermit

heart
is
faint
by
dint
of
stamping
with
impatience
my
heels
have
grown
hard
and

of
my

shepherds
who
posted
themselves
on
the
mountains
with
their
bands
stretched
over
their
eyes
and
searchers
who
cried
out
your
name
in
the
woods
and
scouts
who
ran
along
the
different
roads
saying
to
each
you

him
at
night
i
shed
tears
with
my
face
turned
to
the
wall

little
holes
in

like

asses

motionless
on

ground

great
moons

even
pace

pebbles
in

teeth

tails

gives
a
piercing
whistle
and
a
large
bird
descending
from
the
sky
alights
on
the
top
of
her
from
which
he
scatters
the
blue
powder
his
plumage
of
orange
colour
seems
composed
of
metallic
scales
his
dainty
head
adorned
with
a
silver
tuft
exhibits
a
human
visage
he
has
four
wings
a
vulture

and
an
immense
tail
which
he
displays
in
a
ring
behind
him
he
seizes
in
his
beak
the
queen
parasol
staggers
a
little
before
he
finds
his
equilibrium
then
erects
all
his
feathers
and
remains
motionless
thanks
fair
you
who
have
brought
me
to
the
place
where
the
lover
is
concealed
thanks
thanks
messenger
of
my
heart
he
flies
like
desire
he
travels
all
over
the
world
in
the
evening
he
returns
he
lies
down
at
the
foot
of
my
couch
he
tells
me
what
he
has
seen
the
seas
he
has
flown
over
with
their
fishes
and
their
ships
the
great
empty
deserts
which
he
has
looked
down
upon
from
his
airy
height
in
the
skies
all
the
harvests
bending
in
the
fields
and
the
plants
that
shoot
up
on
the
walls
of
abandoned
cities
she
twists
her
arms
with
a
languishing
air
oh
if
you
were
willing
if
you
were
only
willing
i
have
a
pavilion
on
a
promontory
in
the
midst
of
an
isthmus
between
two
oceans
it
is
wainscotted
with
plates
of
glass
floored
with
and
is
open
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
from
above
i
watch
the
return
of
my
fleets
and
the
people
who
ascend
the
hill
with
loads
on
their
shoulders
we
should
sleep
on
down
softer
than
clouds
we
should
drink
cool
draughts
out
of
the
rinds
of
fruit
and
we
gaze
at
the
sun
through
a
canopy
of
emeralds
come
antony
recoils
she
draws
close
to
him
and
in
a
tone
of
irritation
how
so
rich
coquettish
and
in
love
is
not
that
enough
for
you
eh
but
must
she
be
lascivious
gross
with
a
hoarse
voice
a
head
of
hair
like
fire
and
rebounding
flesh
do
you
prefer
a
body
cold
as
a
serpent
skin
or
perchance
great
black
eyes
more
sombre
than
mysterious
caverns
look
at
these
eyes
of
mine
then
antony
gazes
at
them
in
spite
of
himself
all
the
women
you
ever
have
met
from
the
daughter
of
the
singing
beneath
her
lantern
to
the
fair
patrician
scattering
leaves
from
the
top
of
her
litter
all
the
forms
you
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
all
the
imaginings
of
your
desire
ask
for
them
i
am
not
a
woman
i
am
a
world
my
garments
have
but
to
fall
and
you
shall
discover
upon
my
person
a
succession
of
mysteries
antony
teeth
chattered
if
you
placed
your
finger
on
my
shoulder
it
would
be
like
a
stream
of
fire
in
your
veins
the
possession
of
the
least
part
of
my
body
will
fill
you
with
a
joy
more
vehement
than
the
conquest
of
an
empire
bring
your
lips
near
my
kisses
have
the
taste
of
fruit
which
would
melt
in
your
heart
ah
how
you
will
lose
yourself
in
my
tresses
caress
my
breasts
marvel
at
my
limbs
and
be
scorched
by
my
eyes
between
my
arms
in
a
whirlwind
antony
makes
the
sign
of
the
cross
so
then
you
disdain
me
farewell
she
turns
away
weeping
then
she
returns
are
you
quite
sure
so
lovely
a
woman
she
laughs
and
the
ape
who
holds
the
end
of
her
robe
lifts
it
up
you
will
repent
my
fine
hermit
you
will
groan
you
will
be
sick
of
life
but
i
will
mock
at
you
la
la
la
oh
oh
oh
she
goes
off
with
her
hands
on
her
waist
skipping
on
one
foot
the
slaves
file
off
before
saint
antony
face
together
with
the
horses
the
dromedaries
the
elephant
the
attendants
the
mules
once
more
covered
with
their
loads
the
negro
boys
the
ape
and
the
couriers
holding
their
broken
lilies
in
their
hands
and
the
queen
of
sheba
departs
with
a
spasmodic
utterance
which
might
be
either
a
sob
or
a
chuckle

chapter
iii
the
disciple
hilarion
when
she
has
disappeared
antony
perceives
a
child
on
the
threshold
of
his
cell
it
is
one
of
the
queen
servants
he
thinks
this
child
is
small
like
a
dwarf
and
yet
thickset
like
one
of
the
cabiri
distorted
and
with
a
miserable
aspect
white
hair
covers
his
prodigiously
large
head
and
he
shivers
under
a
sorry
tunic
while
he
grasps
in
his
hand
a
roll
of
papyrus
the
light
of
the
moon
across
which
a
cloud
is
passing
falls
upon
him
antony
observes
him
from
a
distance
and
is
afraid
of
him
who
are
you
the
child
replies
your
former
disciple
hilarion
you
lie
hilarion
has
been
living
for
many
years
in
palestine
i
have
returned
from
it
it
is
i
in
good
sooth
draws
closer
and
inspects
him
why
his
figure
was
bright
as
the
dawn
open
joyous
this
one
is
quite
sombre
and
has
an
aged
look
i
am
worn
out
with
constant
toiling
the
voice
too
is
different
it
has
a
tone
that
chills
you
that
is
because
i
nourish
myself
on
bitter
fare
and
those
white
locks
i
have
had
so
many
griefs
aside
can
it
be
possible
i
was
not
so
far
away
as
you
imagined
the
hermit
paul
paid
you
a
visit
this
year
during
the
month
of
schebar
it
is
just
twenty
days
since
the
nomads
brought
you
bread
you
told
a
sailor
the
day
before
yesterday
to
send
you
three
bodkins
he
knows
everything
learn
too
that
i
have
never
left
you
but
you
spend
long
intervals
without
perceiving
me
how
is
that
no
doubt
my
head
is
troubled
especially
all
the
deadly
sins
have
arrived
but
their
miserable
snares
are
of
no
avail
against
a
saint
like
you
oh
no
no
every
minute
i
give
way
would
that
i
were
one
of
those
whose
souls
are
always
intrepid
and
their
minds
firm
like
the
great
athanasius
for
example
he
was
unlawfully
ordained
by
seven
bishops
what
does
it
matter
if
his
virtue
come
now
a
haughty
cruel
man
always
mixed
up
in
intrigues
and
finally
exiled
for
being
a
monopolist
calumny
you
will
not
deny
that
he
tried
to
corrupt
eustatius
the
treasurer
of
the
bounties
so
it
is
stated
and
i
admit
it
he
burned
for
revenge
the
house
of
arsenius
alas
at
the
council
of
nicæa
he
said
speaking
of
jesus
man
of
the
lord
ah
that
is
a
blasphemy
so
limited
is
he
too
that
he
acknowledges
he
knows
nothing
as
to
the
nature
of
the
word
smiling
with
pleasure
in
fact
he
has
not
a
very
lofty
intellect
if
they
had
put
you
in
his
place
it
would
have
been
a
great
satisfaction
for
your
brethren
as
well
as
yourself
this
life
apart
from
others
is
a
bad
thing
on
the
contrary
man
being
a
spirit
should
withdraw
himself
from
perishable
things
all
action
degrades
him
i
would
like
not
to
cling
to
the
earth
even
with
the
soles
of
my
feet
hypocrite
who
plunges
himself
into
solitude
to
free
himself
the
better
from
the
outbreaks
of
his
lusts
you
deprive
yourself
of
meat
of
wine
of
stoves
of
slaves
and
of
honours
but
how
you
let
your
imagination
offer
you
banquets
perfumes
naked
women
and
applauding
crowds
your
chastity
is
but
a
more
subtle
kind
of
corruption
and
your
contempt
for
the
world
is
but
the
impotence
of
your
hatred
against
it
this
is
the
reason
that
persons
like
you
are
so
lugubrious
or
perhaps
it
is
because
they
lack
faith
the
possession
of
the
truth
gives
joy
was
jesus
sad
he
used
to
go
about
surrounded
by
friends
he
rested
under
the
shade
of
the
olive
entered
the
house
of
the
publican
multiplied
the
cups
pardoned
the
fallen
woman
healing
all
sorrows
as
for
you
you
have
no
pity
save
for
your
own
wretchedness
you
are
so
much
swayed
by
a
kind
of
remorse
and
by
a
ferocious
insanity
that
you
would
repel
the
caress
of
a
dog
or
the
smile
of
a
child
bursts
out
sobbing
enough
enough
you
move
my
heart
too
much
shake
off
the
vermin
from
your
rags
get
rid
of
your
filth
your
god
is
not
a
moloch
who
requires
flesh
as
a
sacrifice
still
suffering
is
blessed
the
cherubim
bend
down
to
receive
the
blood
of
confessors
then
admire
the
montanists
they
surpass
all
the
rest
but
it
is
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
that
makes
the
martyr
how
can
he
prove
its
excellence
seeing
that
he
testifies
equally
on
behalf
of
error
be
silent
viper
it
is
not
perhaps
so
difficult
the
exhortations
of
friends
the
pleasure
of
outraging
popular
feeling
the
oath
they
take
a
certain
giddy
excitement
a
thousand
things
in
fact
go
to
help
them
antony
draws
away
from
hilarion
hilarion
follows
him
besides
this
style
of
dying
introduces
great
disorders
dionysius
cyprian
and
gregory
avoided
it
peter
of
alexandria
has
disapproved
of
it
and
the
council
of
elvira
stops
his
ears
i
will
listen
to
no
more
raising
his
voice
here
you
are
again
falling
into
your
habitual
sin
laziness
ignorance
is
the
froth
of
pride
you
say
conviction
is
formed
why
discuss
the
matter
and
you
despise
the
doctors
the
philosophers
tradition
and
even
the
text
of
the
law
of
which
you
know
nothing
do
you
think
you
hold
wisdom
in
your
hand
i
am
always
hearing
him
his
noisy
words
fill
my
head
the
endeavours
to
comprehend
god
are
better
than
your
mortifications
for
the
purpose
of
moving
him
we
have
no
merit
save
our
thirst
for
truth
religion
alone
does
not
explain
everything
and
the
solution
of
the
problems
which
you
have
ignored
might
render
it
more
unassailable
and
more
sublime
therefore
it
is
essential
for
each
salvation
that
he
should
hold
intercourse
with
his
brethren
otherwise
the
church
the
assembly
of
the
faithful
would
be
only
a
word
and
that
he
should
listen
to
every
argument
and
not
disdain
anything
or
anyone
balaam
the
soothsayer
æschylus
the
poet
and
the
sybil

a
command
to
read
every
book
saint
clement

us
to
study
greek
literature
hermas
was
converted
by
the
illusion
of
a
woman
that
he
loved
what
an
air
of
authority
it
appears
to
me
that
you
are
growing
taller
in
fact
hilarion
height
has
progressively
increased
and
in
order
not
to
see
him
antony
closes
his
eyes
make
your
mind
easy
good
hermit
let
us
sit
down
here
on
this
big
stone
as
of
yore
when
at
the
break
of
day
i
used
to
salute
you
addressing
you
as
morning
star
and
you
at
once
began
to
give
me
instruction
it
is
not
finished
yet
the
moon
affords
us
sufficient
light
i
am
all
attention
he
has
drawn
forth
a
calamus
from
his
girdle
and
on
the
ground
with
his
roll
of
papyrus
in
his
hand
he
raises
his
head
towards
antony
who
seated
beside
him
keeps
his
forehead
bent
is
not
the
word
of
god
confirmed
for
us
by
the
miracles
and
yet
the
sorcerers
of
pharaoh
worked
miracles
other
impostors
could
do
the
same
so
here
we
may
be
deceived
what
then
is
a
miracle
an
occurrence
which
seems
to
us
outside
the
limits
of
nature
but
do
we
know
all
nature
powers
and
from
the
mere
fact
that
a
thing
ordinarily
does
not
astonish
us
does
it
follow
that
we
comprehend
it
it
matters
little
we
must
believe
in
the
scripture
saint
paul
origen
and
some
others
did
not
interpret
it
literally
but
if
we
explain
it
allegorically
it
becomes
the
heritage
of
a
limited
number
of
people
and
the
evidence
of
its
truth
vanishes
what
are
we
to
do
then
leave
it
to
the
church
then
the
scripture
is
useless
not
at
all
although
the
old
testament
i
admit
has
well
obscurities
but
the
new
shines
forth
with
a
pure
light
and
yet
the
angel
of
the
annunciation
in
matthew
appears
to
joseph
whilst
in
luke
it
is
to
mary
the
anointing
of
jesus
by
a
woman
comes
to
pass
according
to
the
first
gospel
at
the
beginning
of
his
public
life
but
according
to
the
three
others
a
few
days
before
his
death
the
drink
which
they
offer
him
on
the
cross
is
in
matthew
vinegar
and
gall
in
mark
wine
and
myrrh
if
we
follow
luke
and
matthew
the
apostles
ought
to
take
neither
money
nor
bag
in
fact
not
even
sandals
or
a
staff
while
in
mark
on
the
contrary
jesus
forbids
them
to
carry
with
them
anything
except
sandals
and
a
staff
here
is
where
i
get
lost
in
amazement
in
fact
in
fact
at
the
contact
of
the
woman
with
the
issue
of
blood
jesus
turned
round
and
said
has
touched
me
so
then
he
did
not
know
who
touched
him
that
is
opposed
to
the
omniscience
of
jesus
if
the
tomb
was
watched
by
guards
the
women
had
not
to
worry
themselves
about
an
assistant
to
lift
up
the
stone
from
the
tomb
therefore
there
were
no
guards
there
or
rather
the
holy
women
were
not
there
at
all
at
emmaüs
he
eats
with
his
disciples
and
makes
them
feel
his
wounds
it
is
a
human
body
a
material
object
which
can
be
weighed
and
which
nevertheless
passes
through
stone
walls
is
this
possible
it
would
take
a
good
deal
of
time
to
answer
you
why
did
he
receive
the
holy
ghost
although
he
was
the
son
what
need
had
he
of
baptism
if
he
were
the
word
how
could
the
devil
tempt
him
god
have
these
thoughts
never
occurred
to
you
yes
often
torpid
or
frantic
they
dwell
in
my
conscience
i
crush
them
out
they
spring
up
again
they
stifle
me
and
sometimes
i
believe
that
i
am
accursed
then
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
serve
god
i
have
always
need
to
adore
him
after
a
prolonged
silence
hilarion
resumes
but
apart
from
dogma
entire
liberty
of
research
is
permitted
us
do
you
wish
to
become
acquainted
with
the
hierarchy
of
angels
the
virtue
of
numbers
the
explanation
of
germs
and
metamorphoses
yes
yes
my
mind
is
struggling
to
escape
from
its
prison
it
seems
to
me
that
by
gathering
my
forces
i
shall
be
able
to
effect
this
sometimes
even
for
an
interval
brief
as
a
i
feel
myself
as
it
were
suspended
in
then
i
fall
back
again
the
secret
which
you
are
anxious
to
possess
is
guarded
by
sages
they
live
in
a
distant
country
sitting
under
gigantic
trees
robed
in
white
and
calm
as
gods
a
warm
atmosphere
nourishes
them
all
around
leopards
stride
through
the
plains
the
murmuring
of
fountains
mingles
with
the
neighing
of
unicorns
you
shall
hear
them
and
the
face
of
the
unknown
shall
be
unveiled
sighing
the
road
is
long
and
i
am
old
oh
oh
men
of
learning
are
not
rare
there
are
some
of
them
even
very
close
to
you
here
let
us
enter
chapter
iv
the
fiery
trial
and
antony
sees
in
front
of
him
an
immense
basilica
the
light
projects
itself
from
the
lower
end
with
the
magical
effect
of
a
sun
it
lights
up
the
innumerable
heads
of
the
multitude
which
fills
the
nave
and
surges
between
the
columns
towards
the
where
one
can
distinguish
in
the
wooden
compartments
altars
beds
chainlets
of
little
blue
stones
and
constellations
painted
on
the
walls
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
groups
are
stationed
here
and
there
men
standing
on
stools
are
discoursing
with
lifted
fingers
others
are
praying
with
arms
crossed
or
lying
down
on
the
ground
or
singing
hymns
or
drinking
wine
around
a
table
the
faithful
are
carrying
on
the
martyrs
are
unswathing
their
limbs
to
show
their
wounds
old
men
leaning
on
their
staffs
are
relating
their
travels
amongst
them
are
people
from
the
country
of
the
germans
from
thrace
gaul
scythia
and
the
indies
with
snow
on
their
beards
feathers
in
their
hair
thorns
in
the
fringes
of
their
garments
sandals
covered
with
dust
and
skins
burnt
by
the
sun
all
costumes
are
mingled
mantles
of
purple
and
robes
of
linen
embroidered
dalmatics
woollen
jackets
sailors
caps
and
bishops
mitres
their
eyes
gleam
strangely
they
have
the
appearance
of
executioners
or
of
eunuchs
hilarion
advances
among
them
antony
pressing
against
his
shoulder
observes
them
he
notices
a
great
many
women
several
of
them
are
dressed
like
men
with
their
hair
cut
short
he
is
afraid
of
them
these
are
the
christian
women
who
have
converted
their
husbands
besides
the
women
are
always
for
jesus
even
the
idolaters
as
witness
procula
the
wife
of
pilate
and
poppæa
the
concubine
of
nero
do
tremble
any
more
come
on
there
are
fresh
arrivals
every
moment
they
multiply
they
separate
swift
as
shadows
all
the
time
making
a
great
uproar
or
intermingling
yells
of
rage
exclamations
of
love
canticles
and
upbraidings
in
a
low
tone
what
do
they
want
the
lord
said
may
still
have
to
speak
to
you
about
many
things
they
possess
those
things
and
he
pushes
him
towards
a
throne
of
gold
five
paces
off
where
surrounded
by
disciples
all
anointed
with
oil
pale
and
emaciated
sits
the
prophet
manes
beautiful
as
an
archangel
motionless
as
a
statue
wearing
an
indian
robe
with
carbuncles
in
his
plaited
hair
a
book
of
coloured
pictures
in
his
left
hand
and
a
globe
under
his
right
the
pictures
represent
the
creatures
who
are
slumbering
in
chaos
antony
bends
forward
to
see
him
then
manes
makes
his
globe
revolve
and
attuning
his
words
to
the
music
of
a
lyre
from
which
bursts
forth
crystalline
sounds
he
says
the
celestial
earth
is
at
the
upper
extremity
the
mortal
earth
at
the
lower
it
is
supported
by
two
angels
the
splenditenens
and
the
omophorus
with
six
faces
at
the
summit
of
heaven
the
impassible
divinity
occupies
the
highest
seat
underneath
face
to
face
are
the
son
of
god
and
the
prince
of
darkness
the
darkness
having
made
its
way
into
his
kingdom
god
extracted
from
his
essence
a
virtue
which
produced
the
first
man
and
he
surrounded
him
with
five
elements
but
the
demons
of
darkness
deprived
him
of
one
part
and
that
part
is
the
soul
there
is
but
one
soul
spread
through
the
universe
like
the
water
of
a
stream
divided
into
many
channels
this
it
is
that
sighs
in
the
wind
grinds
in
the
marble
which
is
sawn
howls
in
the
voice
of
the
sea
and
it
sheds
milky
tears
when
the
leaves
are
torn
off
the
the
souls
that
leave
this
world
emigrate
towards
the
stars
which
are
animated
beings
antony
begins
to
laugh
ah
ah
what
an
absurd
hallucination
beardless
and
of
austere
aspect
why
antony
is
about
to
reply
but
hilarion
tells
him
in
an
undertone
that
this
man
is
the
mighty
origen
and
manes
resumes
at
first
they
stay
in
the
moon
where
they
are
purified
after
that
they
ascend
to
the
sun
slowly
i
know
nothing
to
prevent
us
from
believing
it
the
end
of
every
creature
is
the
liberation
of
the
celestial
ray
shut
up
in
matter
it
makes
its
escape
more
easily
through
perfumes
spices
the
aroma
of
old
wine
the
light
substances
that
resemble
thought
but
the
actions
of
daily
life
withhold
it
the
murderer
will
be
born
again
in
the
body
of
a
eunuch
he
who
slays
an
animal
will
become
that
animal
if
you
plant
a
you
will
be
fastened
in
its
branches
food
absorbs
those
who
use
it
therefore
mortify
yourselves
fast
they
are
temperate
as
you
see
there
is
a
great
deal
of
it
in
less
in
herbs
besides
the
pure
by
the
force
of
their
merits
despoil
vegetables
of
that
luminous
spark
and
it
flies
towards
its
source
the
animals
by
generation
imprison
it
in
the
flesh
therefore
avoid
women
admire
their
countenance
or
rather
act
so
well
that
they
may
not
be
prolific
it
is
better
for
the
soul
to
sink
on
the
earth
than
to
languish
in
carnal
fetters
ah
abomination
what
matters
the
hierarchy
of
iniquities
the
church
has
done
well
to
make
marriage
a
sacrament
in
syrian
costume
he
propagates
a
dismal
order
of
things
the
father
in
order
to
punish
the
rebel
angels
commanded
them
to
create
the

christ
came
in
order
that
the

those

an

to

and
deceive
the

and
did
he
not

the

astray
spreading

and
idolatry
certainly
the

not
the
true
god
clement

the
babylonian
magi
it

the

the

backward
horror
holding
him
up
you
drive
yourself
to
despair
too
quickly
you
do
rightly
comprehend
their
doctrine
here
is
one
who
has
received
his
from
theodas
the
friend
of
saint
paul
hearken
to
him
and
at
a
signal
from
hilarion
valentinus
in
a
tunic
of
silver
cloth
with
a
hissing
voice
and
a
pointed
skull
cries
the
world
is
the
work
of
a
delirious
god
hangs
down
his
head
the
work
of
a
delirious
god
after
a
long
silence
how
is
that
the
most
perfect
of
the
æons
the
abysm
reposed
on
the
bosom
of
profundity
together
with
thought
from
their
union
sprang
intelligence
who
had
for
his
consort
truth
intelligence
and
truth
engendered
the
word
and
life
which
in
their
turn
engendered
man
and
the
church
and
this
makes
eight
æons
he
reckons
on
his
fingers
the

and
truth
produced
ten
other
æons
that
is
to
say
five
couples

and
the
church
produced
twelve
others
amongst
whom
were
the
paraclete
and

hope
and
charity
perfection
and

the
entire
of
those
thirty

of

thus
like
the
echoes
of
a
voice
that
is
dying
away
like
the
exhalations
of
a
perfume
that
is
evaporating
like

the
powers
that

powers
are
always
growing
feeble
but
sophia
desirous
of
knowing
the
father
rushed
out
of
the
pleroma
and
the
word
then
made
another
pair
christ
and
the
holy
ghost
who
bound
together
all
the
æons
and
all
together
they
formed
jesus
the
flower
of

pleroma
meanwhile
the
effort
of
sophia
to
escape
had
left
in

image
of
her

evil
substance
acharamoth
the

took
pity
on
her
and
delivered
her
from

passions

from

being
set

from
acharamoth
sprang
the
demiurge
the
fabricator
of
the
worlds
the
heavens
and
the
devil
he
dwells
much
lower
down
than
the
pleroma
without
even
beholding
it
so
that
he
imagines
he
is
the
true
god
and
repeats
through
the
mouths
of
his
prophets
me
there
is
no
god
then
he
made
man
and
cast
into
his
soul
the
immaterial
seed
which
was
the
church
the
reflection
of
the
other
church
placed
in

acharamoth
one

having
reached
the
highest
region
shall
unite
with
the
saviour
the
fire
hidden
in
the
world
shall
annihilate
all
matter
shall
then
consume
itself
and
men
having
become
pure
spirits
shall
espouse
the
angels
then
the
demon
shall
be
conquered
and
the
reign
of
god
shall
begin

an
exclamation
and
immediately
basilides
catching
him
by
the
elbow
the
supreme
being
with
his
infinite
emanations
is
called
abraxas
and
the
saviour
with
all
his
virtues
kaulakau

the
power
of
kaulakau
is
obtained
by
the
aid
of
certain
words
inscribed
on
this
calcedony
to
facilitate
memory
and
he
shows
on
his
neck
a
little
stone
on
which
fantastic
lines
are
engraved
then
you
shall
be
transported
into
the
invisible
and
unfettered
by
law
you
shall
despise
everything
including
virtue
itself
as
for
us
the
pure
we
must
avoid
sorrow
after
the
example
of
kaulakau
what
and
the

in
hyacinthine
robes
reply
to
him
the
sadness
the
vileness
the
condemnation
and
the
oppression
of
my

are
effaced
thanks
to
the
new

we
may
deny

the

cast
themselves
into

foremost
muttering

passes
close
to
a

where
the

themselves

among

antony
sees
instead
of
tertullian
a
woman
seated
on
a
stone
bench
she
sobs
her
head
resting
against
a
pillar
her
hair
hanging
down
and
her
body
wrapped
in
a
long
brown
simar
then
they
find
themselves
close
to
each
other
far
from
the
crowd
and
a
silence
an
extraordinary
peacefulness
ensues
such
as
one
feels
in
a
wood
when
the
wind
ceases
and
the
leaves
flutter
no
longer
this
woman
is
very
beautiful
though
faded
and
pale
as
death
they
stare
at
each
other
and
their
eyes
mutually
exchange
a
flood
of
thoughts
as
it
were
a
thousand
memories
of
the
past
bewildering
and
profound
at
last
priscilla
begins
to
speak
i
was
in
the
lowest
chamber
of
the
baths
and
i
was
lulled
to
sleep
by
the
confused
murmurs
that
reached
me
from
the
streets
all
at
once
i
heard
loud
exclamations
the
people
cried
is
a
magician
it
is
the
devil
and
the
crowd
stopped
in
front
of
our
house
opposite
to
the
temple
of
æsculapius
i
raised
myself
with
my
wrists
to
the
height
of
the
on
the
peristyle
of
the
temple
was
a
man
with
an
iron
collar
around
his
neck
he
placed
lighted
coals
on
a
and
with
them
made
large
furrows
on
his
breast
calling
out
jesus
the
people
said
is
not
lawful
let
us
stone
him
but
he
did
not
desist
the
things
that
were
occurring
were
unheard
of
astounding
flowers
large
as
the
sun
turned
around
before
my
eyes
and
i
heard
a
harp
of
gold
vibrating
in
the
day
sank
to
its
close
my
arms
let
go
the
iron
bars
my
strength
was
exhausted
and
when
he
bore
me
away
to
his
house
whom
are
you
talking
about
why
of
montanus
but
montanus
is
dead
that
is
not
true
no
montanus
is
not
dead
antony
comes
back
and
near
him
on
the
other
side
upon
a
bench
a
second
woman
is
seated
this
one
being
fair
and
paler
still
with
swellings
under
her
eyelids
as
if
she
had
been
a
long
time
weeping
without
waiting
for
him
to
question
her
she
says
we
were
returning
from
tarsus
by
the
mountains
when
at
a
turn
of
the
road
we
saw
a
man
under
a
he
cried
from
a
distance
and
he
sprang
forward
pouring
out
abuse
on
us
the
slaves
rushed
up
to
protect
us
he
burst
out
laughing
the
horses
pranced
the
mastiffs
all
began
to
howl
he
was
standing
up
the
perspiration
fell
down
his
face
the
wind
made
his
cloak
flap
while
addressing
us
by
name
he
reproached
us
for
the
vanity
of
our
actions
the
impurity
of
our
bodies
and
he
raised
his
fist
towards
the
dromedaries
on
account
of
the
silver
bells
which
they
wore
under
their
jaws
his
fury
filled
my
very
entrails
with
terror
nevertheless
it
was
a
voluptuous
sensation
which
soothed
intoxicated
me
at
first
the
slaves
drew
near
said
they
beasts
are
fatigued
then
there
were
the
women
are
frightened
and
the
slaves
ran
away
after
that
the
children
began
to
cry
are
hungry
and
as
no
answer
was
given
to
the
women
they
disappeared
and
now
he
began
to
speak
i
perceived
that
there
was
some
one
close
beside
me
it
was
my
husband
i
listened
to
the
other
the
first
crawled
between
the
stones
exclaiming
you
abandon
me
and
i
replied
begone
in
order
to
accompany
montanus
a
eunuch
ah
coarse
heart
you
are
astonished
at
this
yet
magdalen
jane
martha
and
susanna
did
not
enter
the
couch
of
the
saviour
souls
can
be
madly
embraced
more
easily
than
bodies
in
order
to
retain
eustolia
with
impunity
the
bishop
leontius
mutilated
himself
cherishing
his
love
more
than
his
virility
and
then
it
is
not
my
own
fault
a
spirit
compels
me
to
do
it
eotas
can
not
cure
me
nevertheless
he
is
cruel
what
does
it
matter
i
am
the
last
of
the
prophetesses
and
after
me
the
end
of
the
world
will
come
he
has
loaded
me
with
his
gifts
none
of
the
others
loved
me
so
much
nor
is
any
of
them
better
loved
you
lie
i
am
the
person
he
loves
no
it
is
i
they
fight
between
their
shoulders
appears
a
negro
head
covered
with
a
black
cloak
fastened
by
two
dead
bones
be
quiet
my
doves
incapable
of
terrestrial
happiness
we
by
this
union
attain
to
spiritual
plenitude
after
the
age
of
the
father
the
age
of
the
son
and
i
inaugurate
the
third
that
of
the
paraclete
his
light
came
to
me
during
the
forty
nights
when
the
heavenly
jerusalem
shone
in
the
firmament
above
my
house
at
pepuza
ah
how
you
cry
out
with
anguish
when
the
thongs
flagellate
you
how
your
aching
limbs
offer
themselves
to
my
burning
caresses
how
you
languish
upon
my
breast
with
an
inconceivable
love
it
is
so
strong
that
it
has
revealed
new
worlds
to
you
and
you
can
now
behold
spirits
with
your
mortal
eyes
antony
makes
a
gesture
of
astonishment
coming
up
close
to
montanus
no
doubt
since
the
soul
has
a
body
that
which
has
no
body
exists
not
in
order
to
render
it
less
material
i
have
introduced
numerous
mortifications
three
lents
every
year
and
for
each
night
prayers
in
saying
which
the
mouth
is
kept
closed
for
fear
the
breath
in
escaping
should
sully
the
mental
act
it
is
necessary
to
abstain
from
second
marriages
or
rather
from
marriage
altogether
the
angels
sinned
with
women
the
archontics
in
the
saviour
said
came
to
destroy
the
work
of
the
woman
the
tatianists
in
of
rushes
she
is
the
tree
of
evil
our
bodies
are
the
garments
of
skin
and
ever
advancing
on
the
same
side
antony
encounters
the
valesians
stretched
on
the
ground
with
red
plates
below
their
stomachs
beneath
their
tunics
they
present
to
him
a
knife
do
like
origen
and
like
us
is
it
the
pain
you
fear
coward
is
it
the
love
of
your
flesh
that
restrains
you
hypocrite
and
while
he
watches
them
struggling
extended
on
their
backs
swimming
in
their
own

the
cainites
with
their
hair
fastened
by

that
god
saved
the

yes
judas
without
him
no
death
and
no

they
pass
out
through
the
band
of
circoncellions
clad
in
crowned
with
thorns
and
carrying
iron
clubs

who
casts
an
envious
glance
at
the

the

the

and
who
is
grieved
at
not
seeing
others
as
miserable
as
himself
as
for
us
the
saints
in
order
to
hasten
the
end
of
the
world
we
poison
burn
massacre
the
only
salvation
is
in
martyrdom
we
give
ourselves
up
to
martyrdom
we
take
off
with
pincers
the
skin
of
our
heads
we
spread
our
limbs
under
the
ploughs
we
cast
ourselves
into
the
mouths
of
furnaces
shame
on

shame
on
the
eucharist
shame
on

universal
damnation
then
throughout
the
basilica
there
is
a
fresh
accession
of
frenzy
the
audians
draw
arrows
against
the
devil
the
collyridians
fling
blue
veils
to
the
ceiling
the

bardesanes

and
the
false
prophetess
of
cappadocia
quite
naked
resting
on
a
lion
and
brandishing
three
torches
yells
forth
the
terrible
invocation
the
pillars
are
poised
like
trunks
of
trees
the
amulets
round
the
necks
of
the
heresiarchs
have
lines
of
flame
crossing
each
other
the
constellations
in
the
chapels
move
to
and
fro
and
the
walls
recede
under
the
alternate
motion
of
the
crowd
in
which
every
head
is
a
wave
which
leaps
and
roars
meanwhile
from
the
very
depths
of
the
uproar
rises
a
song
with
bursts
of
laughter
in
which
the
name
of
jesus
recurs
these
outbursts
come
from
the
common
people
who
all
clap
their
hands
in
order
to
keep
time
with
the
music
in
the
midst
of
them
is
arius
in
the
dress
of
a
deacon
the
fools
who
declaim
against
me
pretend
to
explain
the
absurd
and
in
order
to
destroy
them
entirely
i
have
composed
little
poems
so
comical
that
they
are
known
by
heart
in
the
mills
the
taverns
and
the
ports
a
thousand
times
no
the
son
is
not
with
the
father
nor
of
the
same
substance
otherwise
he
would
not
have
said
remove
from
me
this
chalice
why
do
ye
call
me
good
god
alone
is
good
i
go
to
my
god
to
your
god
and
other
expressions
proving
that
he
was
a
created
being
it
is
demonstrated
to
us
besides
by
all
his
names
lamb
shepherd
fountain
wisdom
son
of
man
prophet
good
way
as
for
me
i
maintain
that
both
are
identical
the
council
of
antioch
has
decided
the
other
way
who
then
is
the
word
who
was
jesus
he
was
the
husband
of
acharamoth
when
she
had
repented
he
was
sem
son
of
noah
he
was
melchisidech
he
was
nothing
but
a
man
he
assumed
the
appearance
of
one
he
simulated
the
passion
of
he
is
a
development
of
the
father
father
and
son
are
the
two
forms
of
a
single
god
he
was
first
in
adam
and
then
in
man
and
he
will
come
back
to
life
again
impossible
his
body
is
celestial
of
he
is
god
only
since
his
baptism
he
dwells
in
the
sun
and
all
the
heresiarchs
form
a
circle
around
antony
who
weeps
with
his
head
in
his
hands
a
jew
with
red
beard
and
his
skin
spotted
with
leprosy
advances
close
to
him
and
chuckling
horribly
his
soul
was
the
soul
of
esau
he
suffered
from
the
disease
of
bellerophon
and
his
mother
the
woman
who
sold
perfumes
surrendered
herself
to
pantherus
a
roman
soldier
under
the
one
harvest
evening
antony
eagerly
lifts
up
his
head
and
gazes
at
them
without
uttering
a
word
then
treading
right
over
them
doctors
magicians
bishops
and
deacons
men
and
phantoms
back
back
ye
are
all
lies
we
have
martyrs
more
martyrs
than
yours
prayers
more
difficult
higher
outbursts
of
love
and
ecstasies
quite
as
protracted
but
no
revelation
no
proofs
then
all
brandish
in
the
air
rolls
of
papyrus
tablets
of
wood
pieces
of
leather
and
strips
of
cloth
and
pushing
them
one
before
the
other
here
is
the
gospel
of
the
hebrews
the
gospel
of
the
lord
the
gospel
of
eve
the
gospel
of
thomas
the
gospel
of
judas
the
treatise
of
the
spirit
that
has
come
the
prophecy
of
barcouf
antony
makes
a
struggle
and
escapes
them
and
he
perceives
in
a
corner
filled
with
shadows
the
old
ebionites
dried
up
like
mummies
their
glances
dull
their
eyebrows
white
they
speak
in
a
quavering
tone
we
have
known
we
ourselves
have
known
the
carpenter
son
we
were
of
his
own
age
we
lived
in
his
street
he
used
to
amuse
himself
by
modelling
little
birds
with
mud
without
being
afraid
of
cutting
the
benches
he
assisted
his
father
in
his
work
or
rolled
up
for
his
mother
balls
of
dyed
wool
then
he
made
a
journey
into
egypt
whence
he
brought
back
wonderful
secrets
we
were
in
jericho
when
he
discovered
the
eater
of
grasshoppers
they
talked
together
in
a
low
tone
without
anyone
being
able
to
hear
them
but
it
was
since
that
occurrence
that
he
made
a
noise
in
galilee
and
that
many
stories
have
been
circulated
concerning
him
they
repeat
tremulously
we
have
known
we
ourselves
we
have
known
him
one
moment
tell
me
pray
tell
me
what
was
his
face
like
fierce
and
repulsive
in
its
aspect
for
he
was
laden
with
all
the
crimes
all
the
sorrows
and
all
the
deformities
of
the
world
oh
no
no
i
imagine
on
the
contrary
that
there
was
about
his
entire
person
a
superhuman
beauty
of
there
is
at
paneadæ
close
to
an
old
ruin
in
the
midst
of
a
rank
growth
of
weeds
a
statue
of
stone
raised
as
it
is
pretended
by
the
woman
with
the
issue
of
blood
but
time
has
gnawed
away
the
face
and
the
rain
has
obliterated
the
inscription
a
woman
comes
forth
from
the
group
of
carpocratians
i
was
formerly
a
deaconess
in
a
little
church
at
rome
where
i
used
to
show
the
faithful
images
in
silver
of
paul
homer
pythagoras
and
jesus
christ
i
have
kept
only
his
she
draws
aside
the
folds
of
her
cloak
do
you
wish
it
he
reappears
himself
when
we
invoke
him
it
is
the
hour
come
and
antony
feels
a
brutal
hand
laid
on
him
which
drags
him
along
he
ascends
a
staircase
in
complete
darkness
and
after
proceeding
for
some
time
arrives
in
front
of
a
door
then
his
guide
is
it
hilarion
he
can
not
tell
says
in
the
ear
of
a
third
person
the
lord
is
about
to
come
and
they
are
introduced
into
an
apartment
with
a
low
ceiling
and
no
furniture
what
strikes
him
at
first
is
opposite
him
a
long
chrysalis
of
the
colour
of
blood
with
a
man
head
from
which
rays
escape
and
the
word
written
in
greek
all
around
it
rises
above
a
shaft
of
a
column
placed
in
the
midst
of
a
pedestal
on
the
other
walls
of
the
apartment
medallions
of
polished
brass
represent
heads
of
animals
that
of
an
ox
of
a
lion
of
an
eagle
of
a
dog
and
again
an
ass
head
the
argil
lamps
suspended
below
these
images
shed
a
flickering
light
antony
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
perceives
the
moon
which
shines
far
away
on
the
waves
and
he
can
even
distinguish
their
monotonous
ripple
with
the
dull
sound
of
a
keel
striking
against
the
stones
of
a
pier
men
squatting
on
the
ground
their
faces
hidden
beneath
their
cloaks
give
vent
at
intervals
to
a
kind
of
stifled
barking
women
are
sleeping
with
their
foreheads
clasped
by
both
arms
which
are
supported
by
their
knees
so
completely
shrouded
by
their
veils
that
one
would
say
they
were
heaps
of
clothes
arranged
along
the
wall
beside
them
children
and
half
devoured
with
vermin
watch
the
lamps
burning
with
an
idiotic
air
and
they
are
doing
nothing
they
are
awaiting
something
they
speak
in
low
voices
about
their
families
or
communicate
to
one
another
remedies
for
their
diseases
many
of
them
are
going
to
embark
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
persecution
having
become
too
severe
the
pagans
however
are
not
hard
to
deceive
they
believe
the
fools
that
we
adore
knouphis
but
one
of
the
brethren
suddenly
inspired
places
himself
in
front
of
the
column
where
they
have
laid
a
loaf
of
bread
which
is
on
the
top
of
a
basket
full
of
fennel
and
hartwort
the
others
have
taken
their
places
forming
as
they
stand
three
parallel
lines
the
inspired
one
unrolls
a
paper
covered
with
cylinders
joined
together
and
then
begins
upon
the
darkness
the
ray
of
the
word
descended
and
a
violent
cry
burst
forth
which
seemed
like
the
voice
of
light
all
responding
while
they
sway
their
bodies
to
and
fro
kyrie
eleison
inspired
man
then
was
created
by
the
infamous
god
of
israel
with
the
assistance
of
those
here
pointing
towards
the
medallions
aristophaios
oraios
sabaoth
adonai
eloi
and
iaô
and
he
lay
on
the
mud
hideous
feeble
shapeless
without
the
power
of
thought
all
in
a
plaintive
tone
kyrie
eleison
inspired
but
sophia
taking
pity
on
him
quickened
him
with
a
portion
of
her
spirit
then
seeing
man
so
beautiful
god
was
seized
with
anger
and
imprisoned
him
in
his
kingdom
interdicting
him
from
the
tree
of
knowledge
still
once
more
the
other
one
came
to
his
aid
she
sent
the
serpent
who
with
its
sinuous
advances
prevailed
on
him
to
disobey
this
law
of
hate
and
man
when
he
had
tasted
knowledge
understood
heavenly
matters
all
with
energy
kyrie
eleison
inspired
but
jaldalaoth
in
order
to
be
revenged
plunged
man
into
matter
and
the
serpent
along
with
him
all
in
very
low
tones
kyrie
eleison
they
close
their
mouths
and
then
become
silent
the
odours
of
the
harbour
mingle
in
the
warm
air
with
the
smoke
of
the
lamps
their
wicks
spluttering
are
on
the
point
of
being
extinguished
and
long
mosquitoes
flutter
around
them
antony
gasps
with
anguish
he
has
the
feeling
that
some
monstrosity
is
floating
around
him
the
horror
of
a
crime
about
to
be
perpetrated
but
the
inspired
one
stamping
with
his
feet
snapping
his
fingers
tossing
his
head
sings
a
psalm
with
a
wild
refrain
to
the
sound
of
cymbals
and
of
a
shrill
flute
come
come
come
come
forth
from
thy
cavern
swift
one
that
runs
without
feet
captor
that
takes
without
hands
sinuous
as
the
waves
round
as
the
sun
darkened
with
spots
of
gold
like
the
firmament
strewn
with
stars
like
the
twistings
of
the
and
the
windings
of
entrails
unbegotten
ever
young
perspicacious
honoured
at
epidaurus
good
for
men
who
cured
king
ptolemy
the
soldiers
of
moses
and
glaucus
son
of
minos
come
come
come
come
forth
from
thy
cavern
all
repeat
come
come
come
come
forth
from
thy
cavern
however
there
is
no
manifestation
why
what
is
the
matter
with
him
they
proceed
to
deliberate
and
to
make
suggestions
one
old
man
offers
a
clump
of
grass
then
there
is
a
rising
in
the
basket
the
green
herbs
are
agitated
the
flowers
fall
and
the
head
of
a
python
appears
he
passes
slowly
over
the
edge
of
the
loaf
like
a
circle
turning
round
a
motionless
disc
then
he
develops
lengthens
he
becomes
of
enormous
weight
to
prevent
him
from
grazing
the
ground
the
men
support
him
with
their
breasts
the
women
with
their
heads
and
the
children
with
the
tips
of
their
fingers
and
his
tail
emerging
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
stretches
out
indefinitely
even
to
the
depths
of
the
sea
his
rings
unfold
themselves
and
fill
the
apartment
they
wind
themselves
round
antony
the
faithful
pressing
their
mouths
against
his
skin
snatch
the
bread
which
he
has
nibbled
it
is
thou
it
is
thou
raised
at
first
by
moses
crushed
by
ezechias
by
the
messiah
he
drank
thee
in
the
waters
of
baptism
but
thou
didst
quit
him
in
the
garden
of
olives
and
then
he
felt
all
his
weakness
writhing
on
the
bar
of
the
cross
and
higher
than
his
head
slavering
above
the
crown
of
thorns
thou
didst
behold
him
dying
for
thou
art
jesus
yes
thou
art
the
word
thou
art
the
christ
antony
swoons
in
horror
and
falls
in
his
cell
upon
the
splinters
of
wood
where
the
torch
which
had
slipped
from
his
hand
is
burning
mildly
this
commotion
causes
him
to
his
eyes
and
he
perceives
the
nile
undulating
and
clear
under
the
light
of
the
moon
like
a
great
serpent
in
the
midst
of
the
sands
so
much
so
that
the
hallucination
again
takes
possession
of
him
he
has
not
quitted
the
ophites
they
surround
him
address
him
by
name
carry
off
baggages
and
descend
towards
the
port
he
embarks
along
with
them
a
brief
period
of
time
flows
by
then
the
vault
of
a
prison
encircles
him
in
front
of
him
iron
bars
make
black
lines
upon
a
background
of
blue
and
at
its
sides
in
the
shade
are
people
weeping
and
praying
surrounded
by
others
who
are
exhorting
and
consoling
them
without
one
is
attracted
by
the
murmuring
of
a
crowd
as
well
as
by
the
splendour
of
a
summer
day
shrill
voices
are
crying
out
watermelons
water
iced
drinks
and
cushions
of
grass
to
sit
down
on
from
time
to
time
shouts
of
applause
burst
forth
he
observes
people
walking
on
their
heads
suddenly
comes
a
continuous
roaring
strong
and
cavernous
like
the
noise
of
water
in
an
aqueduct
and
opposite
him
he
perceives
behind
the
bars
of
another
cage
a
lion
who
is
walking
up
and
down
then
a
row
of
sandals
of
naked
legs
and
of
purple
fringes
overhead
groups
of
people
ranged
symmetrically
widen
out
from
the
lowest
circle
which
encloses
the
arena
to
the
highest
where
masts
have
been
raised
to
support
a
veil
of
hyacinth
hung
in
the
air
on
ropes
staircases
which
radiate
towards
the
centre
intersect
at
equal
distances
those
great
circles
of
stone
their
steps
disappear
from
view
owing
to
the
vast
audience
seated
there
knights
senators
soldiers
common
people
vestals
and
courtesans
in
woollen
hoods
in
silk
maniples
in
tawny
tunics
with
aigrettes
of
precious
stones
tufts
of
feathers
and
lictors
rods
and
all
this
assemblage
muttering
exclaiming
tumultuous
and
frantic
stuns
him
like
an
immense
tub
boiling
over
in
the
midst
of
the
arena
upon
an
altar
smokes
a
vessel
of
incense
the
people
who
surround
him
are
christians
delivered
up
to
the
wild
beasts
the
men
wear
the
red
cloak
of
the
of
saturn
the
women
the
fillets
of
ceres
their
friends
distribute
fragments
of
their
garments
and
rings
in
order
to
gain
admittance
into
the
prison
they
require
they
say
a
great
deal
of
money
but
what
does
it
matter
they
will
remain
till
the
end
amongst
these
consolers
antony
observes
a
bald
man
in
a
black
tunic
a
portion
of
whose
face
is
plainly
visible
he
discourses
with
them
on
the
nothingness
of
the
world
and
the
happiness
of
the
elect
antony
is
filled
with
transports
of
divine
love
he
longs
for
the
opportunity
of
sacrificing
his
life
for
the
saviour
not
knowing
whether
he
is
himself
one
of
these
martyrs
but
save
a
phrygian
with
long
hair
who
keeps
his
arms
raised
they
all
have
a
melancholy
aspect
an
old
man
is
sobbing
on
a
bench
and
a
young
man
who
is
standing
is
musing
with
downcast
eyes
the
old
man
has
refused
to
pay
tribute
at
the
angle
of
a
before
a
statue
of
minerva
and
he
regards
his
companions
with
a
look
which
signifies
you
ought
to
succour
me
communities
sometimes
make
arrangements
by
which
they
might
be
left
in
peace
many
amongst
you
have
even
obtained
letters
falsely
declaring
that
you
have
offered
sacrifice
to
idols
he
asks
is
it
not
peter
of
alexandria
who
has
regulated
what
one
ought
to
do
when
one
is
overcome
by
tortures
then
to
himself
ah
this
is
very
hard
at
my
age
my
infirmities
render
me
so
feeble
perchance
i
might
have
lived
to
another
winter
the
recollection
of
his
little
garden
moves
him
to
tears
and
he
contemplates
the
side
of
the
altar
the
young
man
who
had
disturbed
by
violence
a
feast
of
apollo
murmurs
my
only
chance
was
to
fly
to
the
mountains
the
soldiers
would
have
caught
you
says
one
of
the
brethren
oh
i
could
have
done
like
cyprian
i
should
have
come
back
and
the
second
time
i
should
have
had
more
strength
you
may
be
sure
then
he
thinks
of
the
countless
days
he
should
have
lived
with
all
the
pleasures
which
he
will
not
have
known
and
he
likewise
contemplates
the
side
of
the
altar
but
the
man
in
the
black
tunic
rushes
up
to
him
how
scandalous
what
you
a
victim
of
election
think
of
all
these
women
who
are
looking
at
you
and
then
god
sometimes
performs
a
miracle
pionius
benumbed
the
hands
of
his
executioners
and
the
blood
of
polycarp
extinguished
the
flames
of
his
he
turns
towards
the
old
man
father
father
you
ought
to
edify
us
by
your
death
by
deferring
it
you
will
without
doubt
commit
some
bad
action
which
will
destroy
the
fruit
of
your
good
deeds
besides
the
power
of
god
is
infinite
perhaps
your
example
will
convert
the
entire
people
and
in
the
den
opposite
the
lions
stride
up
and
down
without
stopping
rapidly
with
a
continuous
movement
the
largest
of
them
all
at
once
fixes
his
eyes
on
antony
and
emits
a
roar
and
a
mass
of
vapour
issues
from
his
jaws
the
women
are
jammed
up
against
the
men
the
consoler
goes
from
one
to
another
what
would
ye
say
what
would
any
of
you
say
if
they
burned
you
with
plates
of
iron
if
horses
tore
you
asunder
if
your
body
coated
with
honey
was
devoured
by
insects
you
will
have
only
the
death
of
a
hunter
who
is
surprised
in
a
wood
antony
would
much
prefer
all
this
than
the
horrible
wild
beasts
he
imagines
he
feels
their
teeth
and
their
talons
and
that
he
hears
his
back
cracking
under
their
jaws
a
belluarius
enters
the
dungeon
the
martyrs
tremble
one
alone
amongst
them
is
unmoved
the
phrygian
who
has
gone
into
a
corner
to
pray
he
had
burned
three
temples
he
now
advances
with
lifted
arms
open
mouth
and
his
head
towards
heaven
without
seeing
anything
like
a
somnambulist
the
consoler
exclaims
keep
back
keep
back
the
spirit
of
montanus
will
destroy
ye
all
fall
back
vociferating
damnation
to
the
montanist
they
insult
him
spit
upon
him
would
like
to
strike
him
the
lions
prancing
bite
one
another
manes
the
people
yell
to
the
beasts
to
the
beasts
the
martyrs
bursting
into
sobs
catch
hold
of
one
another
a
cup
of
narcotic
wine
is
offered
to
them
they
quickly
pass
it
from
hand
to
hand
near
the
door
of
the
den
another
belluarius
awaits
the
signal
it
opens
a
lion
comes
out
he
crosses
the
arena
with
great
irregular
strides
behind
him
in
a
row
appear
the
other
lions
then
a
bear
three
panthers
and
leopards
they
scatter
like
a
flock
in
a
prairie
the
cracking
of
a
whip
is
heard
the
christians
stagger
and
in
order
to
make
an
end
of
it
their
brethren
push
them
forward
antony
closes
his
eyes
he
opens
them
again
but
darkness
envelops
him
ere
long
it
grows
bright
once
more
and
he
is
able
to
trace
the
outlines
of
a
plain
arid
and
covered
with
knolls
such
as
may
be
seen
around
a
deserted
quarry
here
and
there
a
clump
of
shrubs
lifts
itself
in
the
midst
of
the
slabs
which
are
on
a
level
with
the
soil
and
above
which
white
forms
are
bending
more
undefined
than
clouds
others
rapidly
make
their
appearance
eyes
shine
through
the
openings
of
long
veils
by
their
indolent
gait
and
the
perfumes
which
exhale
from
them
antony
knows
they
are
ladies
of
patrician
rank
there
are
also
men
but
of
inferior
condition
for
they
have
visages
at
the
same
time
simple
and
coarse
one
of
the
women
with
a
long
breath
ah
how
pleasant
is
the
air
of
the
chilly
night
in
the
midst
of
sepulchres
i
am
so
fatigued
with
the
softness
of
couches
the
noise
of
day
and
the
oppressiveness
of
the
sun
panting
ah
at
last
here
i
am
but
how
irksome
to
have
wedded
an
idolater
the
visits
to
the
prisons
the
conversations
with
our
brethren
all
excite
the
suspicions
of
our
husbands
and
we
must
even
hide
ourselves
from
them
when
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
they
would
take
it
for
a
magical
conjuration
with
mine
there
was
nothing
but
quarrelling
all
day
long
i
did
not
like
to
submit
to
the
abuses
to
which
he
subjected
my
person
and
for
revenge
he
had
me
persecuted
as
a
christian
recall
to
your
memory
that
young
man
of
such
striking
beauty
who
was
dragged
by
the
heels
behind
a
chariot
like
hector
from
the
esquiline
gate
to
the
mountains
of
tibur
and
his
blood
stained
the
bushes
on
both
sides
of
the
road
i
collected
the
drops
here
they
are
she
draws
from
her
bosom
a
sponge
perfectly
black
covers
it
with
kisses
and
then
flings
herself
upon
the
slab
crying
ah
my
friend
my
friend
it
is
just
three
years
since
domitilla
death
she
was
stoned
at
the
bottom
of
the
wood
of
proserpine
i
gathered
her
bones
which
shone
like
in
the
grass
the
earth
now
covers
them
he
flings
himself
upon
a
tombstone
o
my
betrothed
my
betrothed
and
all
the
others
scattered
through
the
plain
o
my
sister
o
my
brother
o
my
daughter
o
my
mother
they
are
on
their
knees
their
foreheads
clasped
with
their
hands
or
their
bodies
lying
flat
with
both
arms
extended
and
the
sobs
which
they
repress
make
their
bosoms
swell
almost
to
bursting
they
gaze
up
at
the
sky
saying
have
pity
on
her
soul
o
my
god
she
is
languishing
in
the
abode
of
shadows
deign
to
admit
her
into
the
resurrection
so
that
she
may
rejoice
in
thy
light
or
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
flagstones
they
murmur
be
at
rest
suffer
no
more
i
have
brought
thee
wine
and
meat
here
is
pudding
made
by
me
according
to
his
taste
with
many
eggs
and
a
double
measure
of
flour
we
are
going
to
eat
together
as
of
yore
is
not
that
so
she
puts
a
little
of
it
on
her
lips
and
suddenly
begins
to
laugh
in
an
extravagant
fashion
frantically
the
others
like
her
nibble
a
morsel
and
drink
a
mouthful
they
tell
one
another
the
history
of
their
martyrs
their
sorrow
becomes
vehement
their
libations
increase
their
eyes
swimming
with
tears
are
fixed
on
one
another
they
stammer
with
inebriety
and
desolation
gradually
their
hands
touch
their
lips
meet
their
veils
are
torn
away
and
they
embrace
one
another
upon
the
tombs
in
the
midst
of
the
cups
and
the
torches
the
sky
begins
to
brighten
the
mist
soaks
their
garments
and
as
if
they
were
strangers
to
one
another
they
take
their
departure
by
different
roads
into
the
country
the
sun
shines
forth
the
grass
has
grown
taller
the
plain
has
become
transformed
across
the
bamboos
antony
sees
a
forest
of
columns
of
a
colour
those
are
trunks
of
trees
springing
from
a
single
trunk
from
each
of
its
branches
descend
other
branches
which
penetrate
into
the
soil
and
the
whole
of
those
horizontal
and
perpendicular
lines
indefinitely
multiplied
might
be
compared
to
a
gigantic
framework
were
it
not
that
here
and
there
appears
a
little
with
a
dark
foliage
like
that
of
a
sycamore
between
the
branches
he
distinguishes
bunches
of
yellow
flowers
and
violets
and
ferns
as
large
as
birds
feathers
under
the
lowest
branches
may
be
seen
at
different
points
the
horns
of
a
buffalo
or
the
glittering
eyes
of
an
antelope
parrots
sit
perched
butterflies
flutter
lizards
crawl
upon
the
ground
flies
buzz
and
one
can
hear
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
the
palpitation
of
an
life
at
the
entrance
of
the
wood
on
a
kind
of
pile
is
a
strange
sight
a
man
coated
over
with
cows
dung
completely
naked
more
than
a
mummy
his
joints
form
knots
at
the
extremities
of
his
bones
which
are
like
sticks
he
has
clusters
of
shells
in
his
ears
his
face
is
very
long
and
his
nose
is
like
a
vulture
beak
his
left
arm
is
held
erect
in
the
air
crooked
and
stiff
as
a
stake
and
he
has
remained
there
so
long
that
birds
have
made
a
nest
in
his
hair
at
the
four
corners
of
his
pile
four
fires
are
blazing
the
sun
is
right
in
his
face
he
gazes
at
it
with
great
open
eyes
and
without
looking
at
antony
brahmin
of
the
banks
of
the
nile
what
sayest
thou
flames
start
out
on
every
side
through
the
partings
of
the
beams
and
the
gymnosophist
resumes
like
a
rhinoceros
i
am
plunged
in
solitude
i
dwelt
in
the
tree
that
was
behind
me
in
fact
the
large
presents
in
its
flutings
a
natural
excavation
of
the
shape
of
a
man
and
i
fed
myself
on
flowers
and
fruits
with
such
an
observance
of
precepts
that
not
even
a
dog
has
seen
me
eat
as
existence
proceeds
from
corruption
corruption
from
desire
desire
from
sensation
and
sensation
from
contact
i
have
avoided
every
kind
of
action
every
kind
of
contact
and
without
stirring
any
more
than
the
pillar
of
a
tombstone
exhaling
my
breath
through
my
two
nostrils
fixing
my
glances
upon
my
nose
and
observing
the
ether
in
my
spirit
the
world
in
my
limbs
the
moon
in
my
heart
i
pondered
on
the
essence
of
the
great
soul
whence
continually
escape
like
sparks
of
fire
the
principles
of
life
i
have
at
last
grasped
the
supreme
soul
in
all
beings
all
beings
in
the
supreme
soul
and
i
have
succeeded
in
making
my
soul
penetrate
the
place
into
which
my
senses
used
to
penetrate
i
receive
knowledge
directly
from
heaven
like
the
bird
tchataka
who
quenches
his
thirst
only
in
the
droppings
of
the
rain
from
the
very
fact
of
my
having
knowledge
of
things
things
no
longer
exist
for
me
now
there
is
no
hope
and
no
anguish
no
goodness
no
virtue
neither
day
nor
night
neither
thou
nor
i
absolutely
nothing
my
frightful
austerities
have
made
me
superior
to
the
powers
a
contraction
of
my
brain
can
kill
a
hundred
kings
sons
dethrone
gods
overrun
the
world
he
utters
all
this
in
a
monotonous
voice
the
leaves
all
around
him
are
withered
the
rats
fly
over
the
ground
he
slowly
lowers
his
eyes
towards
the
flames
which
are
rising
then
adds
i
have
become
disgusted
with
form
disgusted
with
perception
disgusted
even
with
knowledge
itself
for
thought
does
not
outlive
the
transitory
fact
that
gives
rise
to
it
and
the
spirit
like
the
rest
is
but
an
illusion
everything
that
is
born
will
perish
everything
that
is
dead
will
come
to
life
again
the
beings
that
have
actually
disappeared
will
sojourn
in
wombs
not
yet
formed
and
will
come
back
to
earth
to
serve
with
sorrow
other
creatures
but
as
i
have
resolved
through
an
infinite
number
of
existences
under
the
guise
of
gods
men
and
animals
i
give
up
travelling
and
no
longer
wish
for
this
fatigue
i
abandon
the
dirty
inn
of
my
body
walled
in
with
flesh
reddened
with
blood
covered
with
hideous
skin
full
of
uncleanness
and
for
my
reward
i
shall
finally
sleep
in
the
very
depths
of
the
absolute
in
annihilation
the
flames
rise
to
his
breast
then
envelop
him
his
head
stretches
across
as
if
through
the
hole
of
a
wall
his
eyes
are
perpetually
fixed
in
a
vacant
stare
antony
gets
up
again
the
torch
on
the
ground
has
set
fire
to
the
splinters
of
wood
and
the
flames
have
singed
his
beard
bursting
into
an
exclamation
antony
tramples
on
the
fire
and
when
only
a
heap
of
cinders
is
left
where
then
is
hilarion
he
was
here
just
now
i
saw
him
ah
no
it
is
impossible
i
am
mistaken
how
is
this
my
cell
those
stones
the
sand
have
not
perhaps
any
more
reality
i
must
be
going
mad
stay
where
was
i
what
was
happening
here
ah
the
gymnosophist
this
death
is
common
amongst
the
indian
sages
kalanos
burned
himself
before
alexander
another
did
the
same
in
the
time
of
augustus
what
hatred
of
life
they
must
have
had
unless
indeed
pride
drove
them
to
it
no
matter
it
is
the
intrepidity
of
martyrs
as
to
the
others
i
now
believe
all
that
has
been
told
me
of
the
excesses
they
have
occasioned
and
before
this
yes
i
recollect
the
crowd
of
heresiarchs
what
shrieks
what
eyes
but
why
so
many
outbreaks
of
the
flesh
and
wanderings
of
the
spirit
it
is
towards
god
they
pretend
to
direct
their
thoughts
in
all
these
different
ways
what
right
have
i
to
curse
them
i
who
stumble
in
my
own
path
when
they
have
disappeared
i
shall
perhaps
learn
more
this
one
rushed
away
too
quickly
i
had
not
time
to
reply
to
him
just
now
it
is
as
if
i
had
in
my
intellect
more
space
and
more
light
i
am
tranquil
i
feel
myself
capable
but
what
is
this
now
i
thought
i
had
extinguished
the
fire
a
flame
flutters
between
the
rocks
and
speedily
a
jerky
voice
makes
itself
heard
from
the
mountains
in
the
distance
are
those
the
barkings
of
a
hyena
or
the
lamentations
of
some
lost
traveller
antony
listens
the
flame
draws
nearer
and
he
sees
approaching
a
woman
who
is
weeping
resting
on
the
shoulder
of
a
man
with
a
white
beard
she
is
covered
with
a
purple
garment
all
in
rags
he
like
her
is
with
a
tunic
of
the
same
colour
and
carries
a
bronze
vase
whence
arises
a
small
blue
flame
antony
is
filled
with
fear
and
yet
he
would
fain
know
who
this
woman
is
this
is
a
young
girl
a
poor
child
whom
i
take
everywhere
with
me
he
raises
the
bronze
vase
antony
inspects
her
by
the
light
of
this
flickering
flame
she
has
on
her
face
marks
of
bites
and
traces
of
blows
along
her
arms
her
scattered
hair
is
entangled
in
the
rents
of
her
rags
her
eyes
appear
insensible
to
the
light
sometimes
she
remains
thus
a
long
time
without
speaking
or
eating
and
utters
marvellous
things
really
eunoia
eunoia
relate
what
you
have
to
say
she
turns
around
her
eyeballs
as
if
awakening
from
a
dream
passes
her
fingers
slowly
across
her
two
lids
and
in
a
mournful
voice
i
have
a
recollection
of
a
distant
region
of
the
colour
of
emerald
there
is
only
a
single
tree
there
antony
gives
a
start
at
each
step
of
its
huge
branches
a
pair
of
spirits
stand
the
branches
around
them
cross
each
other
like
the
veins
of
a
body
and
they
watch
the
eternal
life
circulating
from
the
roots
where
it
is
lost
in
shadow
up
to
the
summit
which
reaches
beyond
the
sun
i
on
the
second
branch
illumined
with
my
face
the
summer
nights
touching
his
forehead
ah
ah
i
understand
the
head
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
hush
hush
the
vessel
remained
convex
her
keel
clave
the
foam
he
said
to
me
does
it
matter
if
i
disturb
my
country
if
i
lose
my
kingdom
you
will
be
mine
in
my
own
house
how
pleasant
was
the
upper
chamber
of
his
palace
he
would
lie
down
upon
the
ivory
bed
and
smoothing
my
hair
would
sing
in
an
amorous
strain
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
could
see
the
two
camps
and
the
lanterns
which
they
were
lighting
ulysses
at
the
edge
of
his
tent
achilles
armed
from
head
to
foot
driving
a
chariot
along
the
seashore
why
she
is
quite
mad
wherefore
hush
hush
they
rubbed
me
with
unguents
and
sold
me
to
the
people
to
amuse
them
one
evening
standing
with
the
sistrum
in
my
hand
i
was
coaxing
greek
sailors
to
dance
the
rain
like
a
cataract
fell
upon
the
tavern
and
the
cups
of
hot
wine
were
smoking
a
man
entered
without
the
door
having
been
opened
it
was
i
i
found
you
here
she
is
antony
she
who
is
called
sigeh
eunoia
barbelo
prounikos
the
spirits
who
govern
the
world
were
jealous
of
her
and
they
bound
her
in
the
body
of
a
woman
she
was
the
helen
of
the
trojans
whose
memory
the
poet
stesichorus
had
rendered
infamous
she
has
been
lucretia
the
patrician
lady
violated
by
the
kings
she
was
delilah
who
cut
off
the
hair
of
samson
she
was
that
daughter
of
israel
who
surrendered
herself
to
she
has
loved
adultery
idolatry
lying
and
folly
she
was
prostituted
by
every
nation
she
has
sung
in
all
the
she
has
kissed
every
face
at
tyre
she
the
syrian
was
the
mistress
of
thieves
she
drank
with
them
during
the
nights
and
she
concealed
assassins
amid
the
vermin
of
her
tepid
bed
ah
what
is
coming
over
me
with
a
furious
air
i
have
redeemed
her
i
tell
you
and
her
in
all
her
splendour
such
as
caius
cæsar
agricola
became
enamoured
of
when
he
desired
to
sleep
with
the
moon
well
well
but
she
really
is
the
moon
has
not
pope
clement
written
that
she
was
imprisoned
in
a
tower
three
hundred
persons
came
to
surround
the
tower
and
on
each
of
the
murderers
at
the
same
time
the
moon
was
seen
to
appear
though
there
are
not
many
moons
in
the
world
or
many
eunoias
yes
i
think
i
recollect
and
he
falls
into
a
reverie
innocent
as
christ
who
died
for
men
she
has
devoted
herself
to
women
for
the
powerlessness
of
jehovah
is
demonstrated
by
the
transgression
of
adam
and
we
must
shake
off
the
old
law
opposed
as
it
is
to
the
order
of
things
i
have
preached
the
new
gospel
in
ephraim
and
in
issachar
along
the
torrent
of
bizor
behind
the
lake
of
houleh
in
the
valley
of
mageddo
and
beyond
the
mountains
at
bostra
and
at
damas
let
those
who
are
covered
with
those
who
are
covered
with
dirt
those
who
are
covered
with
blood
come
to
me
and
i
will
wash
out
their
defilement
with
the
holy
spirit
called
by
the
greeks
minerva
she
is
minerva
she
is
the
holy
spirit
i
am
jupiter
apollo
the
christ
the
paraclete
the
great
power
of
god
incarnated
in
the
person
of
simon
ah
it
is
you
it
is
you
but
i
know
your
crimes
you
were
born
at
gittha
on
the
borders
of
samaria
dositheus
your
first
master
dismissed
you
you
execrate
saint
paul
for
having
converted
one
of
your
women
and
vanquished
by
saint
peter
in
your
rage
and
terror
you
flung
into
the
waves
the
bag
which
contained
your
magical
instruments
do
you
desire
them
antony
looks
at
him
and
an
inner
voice
murmurs
in

simon
resumes
he
who
understands
the
powers
of
nature
and
the
substance
of
spirits
ought
to
perform
miracles
it
is
the
dream
of
all
sages
and
the
desire
of
which
gnaws
you
confess
it
amongst
the
romans
i
flew
so
high
in
the
circus
that
they
saw
me
no
more
nero
ordered
me
to
be
decapitated
but
it
was
a
sheep
head
that
fell
to
the
ground
instead
of
mine
finally
they
buried
me
alive
but
i
came
back
to
life
on
the
third
day
the
proof
of
it
is
that
i
am
here

the
odour
of
a
corpse

the
appearance
of
a
young
man

of
an
old
man
of
a
tiger

of
an
ant
take
your
face
give
you
mine
and
drive
the
thunderbolt

you

the
thunder

followed
by
flashes
of
lightning
it

the
voice
of
the
most
high
the
eternal
thy
god
is
a
fire
and
all
creations
operate
by
the
emanations
of
this
central
fire
you
are
about
to
receive
the
baptism
of
it
that
second
baptism
announced
by
jesus
which
fell
on
the
apostles
one
stormy
day
when
the
window
was
open
and
all
the
while
stirring
the
flame
with
his
hand
slowly
as
if
to
sprinkle
antony
with
it
mother
of
mercies
thou
who
discoverest
secrets
in
order
that
we
may
have
rest
in
the
eighth
house
antony
exclaims
ah
if
i
had
holy
water
the
flame
goes
out
producing
much
smoke
eunoia
and
simon
have
disappeared
an
extremely
cold
fog
opaque
and
f
oe
tid
fills
the
atmosphere
extending
his
arms
like
a
blind
man
where
am
i
i
am
afraid
of
falling
into
the
abyss
and
the
cross
no
doubt
is
too
far
away
from
me
ah
what
a
night
what
a
night
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
cleaves
the
fog
asunder
and
he
perceives
two
men
covered
with
long
white
tunics
the
first
is
of
tall
stature
with
a
sweet
expression
of
countenance
and
grave
deportment
his
white
hair
parted
like
that
of
christ
descends
regularly
over
his
shoulders
he
has
thrown
down
a
wand
which
he
was
carrying
in
his
hand
and
which
his
companion
has
taken
up
making
a
respectful
bow
after
the
fashion
of
orientals
the
other
is
small
with
a
thick
neck
curly
hair
and
an
air
of
simplicity
both
of
them
are
and
covered
with
dust
like
people
who
have
come
on
a
long
journey
with
a
start
what
do
ye
seek
speak
go
on
he
is
the
little
man
la
la
worthy
hermit
what
do
you
say
i
know
nothing
about
it
here
is
the
master
he
sits
down
the
other
remains
standing
silence
resumes
ye
come
in
this
fashion
oh
a
great
distance
a
very
great
distance
and
ye
are
going
pointing
at
his
companion
wherever
he
wishes
who
then
is
he
look
at
him
he
has
the
appearance
of
a
saint
if
i
dared
the
fog
by
this
time
is
quite
gone
the
atmosphere
has
become
perfectly
clear
the
moon
shines
out
what
are
you
thinking
of
now
that
you
say
nothing
more
i
am
thinking
of
oh
nothing
damis
draws
close
to
apollonius
makes
many
turns
round
him
with
his
figure
bent
and
without
moving
his
head
master
this
is
a
galilean
hermit
who
wishes
to
know
the
sources
of
your
wisdom
let
him
approach
antony
hesitates
approach
in
a
voice
of
thunder
approach
you
would
like
to
know
who
i
am
what
i
have
done
what
i
am
thinking
of
is
that
not
so
child
if
at
the
same
time
those
things
contribute
to
my
salvation
rejoice
i
am
about
to
tell
them
to
you
in
a
low
tone
to
antony
is
it
possible
he
must
have
at
the
first
glance
recognised
your
extraordinary
inclinations
for
philosophy
i
shall
profit
by
it
also
myself
i
will
first
describe
to
you
the
long
road
i
travelled
to
gain
doctrine
and
if
you
find
in
all
my
life
one
bad
action
you
will
stop
me
for
he
must
scandalise
by
his
words
who
has
offended
by
his
actions
to
antony
what
a
just
man
eh
decidedly
i
believe
he
is
sincere
the
night
of
my
birth
my
mother
thought
she
saw
herself
gathering
flowers
on
the
border
of
a
lake
a
flash
of
lightning
appeared
and
she
brought
me
into
the
world
amid
the
cries
of
swans
who
were
singing
in
her
dream
up
to
my
fifteenth
year
they
plunged
me
three
times
a
day
into
the
fountain
asbadeus
whose
waters
render
perjurers
dropsical
and
they
rubbed
my
body
with
leaves
of
cnyza
to
make
me
chaste
a
princess
from
palmyra
sought
me
out
one
evening
and
offered
me
treasures
which
she
knew
were
hidden
in
tombs
a
priest
of
the
temple
of
diana
cut
his
throat
in
despair
with
the
sacrificial
knife
and
the
governor
of
cilicia
after
repeated
promises
declared
before
my
family
that
he
would
put
me
to
death
but
it
was
he
who
died
three
days
after
assassinated
by
the
romans
to
antony
striking
him
on
the
elbow
eh
just
as
i
told
you
what
a
man
i
have
for
four
years
in
succession
observed
the
complete
silence
of
the
pythagoreans
the
most
unforeseen
calamity
did
not
draw
one
sigh
from
me
and
at
the
theatre
when
i
entered
they
turned
aside
from
me
as
from
a
phantom
would
you
have
done
that
you
the
time
of
my
ordeal
ended
i
undertook
to
instruct
the
priests
who
had
lost
the
tradition
what
tradition
let
him
continue
be
silent
i
have
conversed
with
the
samaneans
of
the
ganges
with
the
astrologers
of
chaldea
with
the
magi
of
babylon
with
the
gaulish
druids
with
the
priests
of
the
negroes
i
have
climbed
the
fourteen
olympi
i
have
sounded
the
lakes
of
sythia
i
have
measured
the
vastness
of
the
desert
all
this
is
undoubtedly
true
i
was
there
myself
at
first
i
went
as
far
as
the
hyrcanian
sea
i
have
gone
all
round
it
and
through
the
country
of
the
baraomatæ
where
bucephalus
is
buried
i
have
gone
down
to
nineveh
at
the
gates
of
the
city
a
man
came
up
to
me
i
i
my
good
master
i
loved
you
from
the
very
beginning
you
were
sweeter
than
a
girl
and
more
beautiful
than
a
god
without
listening
to
him
he
wished
to
accompany
me
in
order
to
act
as
an
interpreter
for
me
but
you
replied
that
you
understood
every
language
and
that
you
divined
all
thoughts
then
i
kissed
the
end
of
your
mantle
and
i
walked
behind
you
after
ctesiphon
we
entered
into
the
land
of
babylon
and
the
satrap
uttered
an
exclamation
on
seeing
a
man
so
pale
to
himself
which
signifies
the
king
received
me
standing
near
a
throne
of
silver
in
a
circular
hall
studded
with
stars
and
from
a
cupola
hung
from
unseen
threads
four
great
golden
birds
with
both
wings
extended
musing
are
there
such
things
on
the
earth
that
is
indeed
a
city
babylon
everyone
is
rich
there
the
houses
painted
blue
have
gates
of
bronze
with
staircases
that
lead
down
to
the
river
making
a
sketch
with
his
stick
on
the
ground
like
that
do
you
see
and
then
there
are
temples
squares
baths
aqueducts
the
palaces
are
covered
with
copper
and
then
the
interior
if
you
only
saw
it
on
the
northern
wall
rises
a
tower
which
supports
a
second
a
third
a
fourth
a
fifth
and
there
are
three
others
besides
the
eighth
is
a
chapel
with
a
bed
in
it
nobody
enters
there
but
the
woman
chosen
by
the
priests
for
the
god
belus
the
king
of
babylon
made
me
take
up
my
quarters
in
it
they
scarcely
paid
any
heed
to
me
i
was
left
too
to
walk
about
the
streets
by
myself
i
enquired
into
the
customs
of
the
people
i
visited
the
workshops
i
examined
the
huge
machines
which
bring
water
into
the
gardens
but
it
annoyed
me
to
be
separated
from
the
master
at
last
we
left
babylon
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
we
suddenly
saw
a
wild
mare
yes
indeed
she
sprang
forth
on
her
iron
hoofs
she
neighed
like
an
ass
she
galloped
amongst
the
rocks
he
burst
into
angry
abuse
of
her
and
she
disappeared
aside
where
can
they
have
come
from
at
taxilla
capital
of
five
thousand
fortresses
phraortes
king
of
the
ganges
showed
us
his
guard
of
tall
black
men
five
cubits
high
and
in
the
gardens
of
his
palace
under
a
pavilion
of
green
brocade
an
enormous
elephant
whom
the
queens
used
to
amuse
themselves
in
perfuming
this
was
the
elephant
of
porus
who
fled
after
the
death
of
alexander
and
which
was
found
again
in
a
forest
they
talk
a
great
deal
like
drunken
people
phraortes
made
us
sit
down
at
his
table
what
an
odd
country
the
noblemen
while
drinking
amuse
themselves
by
flinging
arrows
under
the
feet
of
a
child
who
is
dancing
but
i
do
not
approve
when
i
was
ready
to
depart
the
king
gave
me
a
parasol
and
said
to
me
have
on
the
indus
a
stud
of
white
camels
when
you
do
not
want
them
any
longer
blow
into
their
ears
and
they
will
return
we
proceeded
along
the
river
walking
in
the
night
by
the
gleaming
of
the
who
emitted
their
radiance
through
the
bamboos
the
slave
whistled
an
air
to
keep
off
the
serpents
and
our
camels
bent
the
reins
while
passing
under
the
trees
as
if
under
doors
that
were
too
low
one
day
a
black
child
who
held
in
his
hand
a
caduceus
of
gold
conducted
us
to
the
college
of
sages
iarchas
their
chief
spoke
to
me
of
my
ancestors
of
all
my
thoughts
of
all
my
actions
and
all
my
existences
he
had
been
the
river
indus
and
he
recalled
to
my
mind
that
i
had
conducted
the
boats
on
the
nile
in
the
time
of
king
sesostris
as
for
me
they
told
me
nothing
so
that
i
do
not
know
what
i
was
they
have
the
unsubstantial
air
of
shadows
we
met
on
the
seashore
the
cynocephali
glutted
with
milk
who
were
returning
from
their
expedition
in
the
island
of
taprobane
the
tepid
waves
pushed
white
pearls
before
us
the
amber
cracked
under
our
footsteps
whales
skeletons
were
bleaching
in
the
crevices
of
the
cliffs
in
short
the
earth
grew
more
contracted
than
a
sandal
and
after
casting
towards
the
sun
drops
from
the
ocean
we
turned
to
the
right
to
go
back
we
returned
through
the
region
of
the
aromatæ
through
the
country
of
the
gangaridæ
the
promontory
of
comaria
the
land
of
the
sachalitæ
of
the
aramitæ
and
the
homeritæ
then
across
the
cassanian
mountains
the
red
sea
and
the
island
of
topazes
we
penetrated
into
ethiopia
through
the
kingdom
of
the
pygmæi
aside
how
large
the
earth
is
and
when
we
got
home
again
all
those
whom
we
had
known
in
former
days
were
dead
antony
hangs
his
head
silence
goes
on
then
they
began
talking
about
me
in
the
world
the
plague
ravaged
ephesus
i
made
them
stone
an
old
mendicant
and
the
plague
was
gone
what
he
banishes
diseases
at
cnidus
i
cured
the
lover
of
venus
yes
a
madman
who
had
even
promised
to
marry
her
to
love
a
woman
is
bad
enough
but
a
statue
what
idiocy
the
master
placed
his
hand
on
this
man
heart
and
immediately
the
love
was
extinguished
what
he
drives
out
demons
at
tarentum
they
brought
to
the
stake
a
young
girl
who
was
dead
the
master
touched
her
lips
and
she
arose
calling
on
her
mother
can
it
be
he
brings
the
dead
back
to
life
i
foretold
that
vespasian
would
be
emperor
what
he
divines
the
future
there
was
at
corinth
while
i
was
supping
with
him
at
the
waters
of
baia
excuse
me
strangers
it
is
late
a
young
man
named
menippus
no
no
go
away
a
dog
entered
carrying
in
its
mouth
a
hand
that
had
been
cut
off
one
evening
in
one
of
the
suburbs
he
met
a
woman
you
do
not
hear
me
take
yourselves
off
he
prowled
vacantly
around
the
couches
enough
they
wanted
to
drive
him
away
menippus
then
surrendered
himself
to
her
and
they
became
lovers
and
beating
the
mosaic
floor
with
his
tail
he
deposited
this
hand
on
the
knees
of
flavius
but
in
the
morning
at
the
menippus
was
pale
with
a
bound
still
at
it
well
let
them
go
on
since
there
is
not
the
master
said
to
him
beautiful
young
man
you
are
caressing
a
serpent
and
a
serpent
is
caressing
you
for
how
long
are
these
nuptials
every
one
of
us
went
to
the
wedding
i
am
doing
wrong
surely
in
listening
to
this
servants
were
busily
engaged
at
the
vestibule
the
doors
flew
open
nevertheless
one
could
hear
neither
the
noise
of
footsteps
nor
the
sound
of
opening
doors
the
master
seated
himself
beside
menippus
immediately
the
bride
was
seized
with
anger
against
the
philosophers
but
the
vessels
of
gold
the
the
cooks
the
attendants
disappeared
the
roof
flew
away
the
walls
fell
in
and
apollonius
remained
alone
standing
with
this
woman
all
in
tears
at
his
feet
it
was
a
vampire
who
satisfied
the
handsome
young
men
in
order
to
devour
their
flesh
because
nothing
is
better
for
phantoms
of
this
kind
than
the
blood
of
lovers
if
you
wish
to
know
the
art
i
wish
to
know
nothing
on
the
evening
of
our
arrival
at
the
gates
of
rome
oh
yes
tell
me
about
the
city
of
the
popes
a
drunken
man
accosted
us
who
sang
with
a
sweet
voice
it
was
an
epithalamium
of
nero
and
he
had
the
power
of
causing
the
death
of
anyone
who
heard
him
with
indifference
he
carried
on
his
back
in
a
box
a
string
taken
from
the
cithara
of
the
emperor
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
he
threw
mud
in
our
faces
then
i
unfastened
my
girdle
and
placed
it
in
his
hands
in
this
instance
you
were
quite
wrong
the
emperor
during
the
night
made
me
call
at
his
residence
he
played
at
ossicles
with
sporus
leaning
with
his
left
arm
on
a
table
of
agate
he
turned
round
and
knitting
his
fair
brows
are
you
not
afraid
of
me
he
asked
the
god
who
made
you
terrible
has
made
me
intrepid
i
replied
to
himself
something
unaccountable
fills
me
with
fear
silence
resumes
in
a
shrill
voice
all
asia
moreover
could
tell
you
starting
up
i
am
sick
leave
me
listen
now
at
ephesus
he
witnessed
the
death
of
domitian
who
was
at
rome
making
an
effort
to
laugh
is
this
possible
yes
at
the
theatre
in
broad
daylight
on
the
fourteenth
of
the
kalends
of
october
he
suddenly
exclaimed
are
murdering
cæsar
and
he
added
every
now
and
then
rolls
on
the
ground
oh
how
he
struggles
he
gets
up
again
he
attempts
to
fly
the
gates
are
shut
ah
it
is
finished
he
is
dead
and
that
very
day
in
fact
titus
flavius
domitianus
was
assassinated
as
you
are
aware
without
the
aid
of
the
devil
no
doubt
he
wished
to
put
me
to
death
this
domitian
damis
fled
by
my
direction
and
i
remained
alone
in
my
prison
it
was
a
terrible
bit
of
daring
i
must
confess
about
the
fifth
hour
the
soldiers
led
me
to
the
tribunal
i
had
my
speech
quite
ready
which
i
kept
under
my
cloak
the
rest
of
us
were
on
the
bank
of
puzzoli
we
saw
you
die
we
wept

my
virtue
which

raised
me
even
to
the
height
of
the
most
high
tyana
his
native
city
has
erected
a
temple
with
priests
in
his
honour
draws
close
to
antony
and
bending
towards
his
ear

truth

gods

the
rites

the
prayers

the
oracles

have
penetrated
into
the
cavern
of
trophonius

son
of
apollo
i
have
moulded
for
the
syracusans
the
cakes
which
they
use
on
the
mountains
i
have
undergone
the
eighty
tests
of
mithra
i
have
pressed
against
my
heart
the
serpent
of
sabacius
i
have
received
the
scarf
of
the
cabiri
i
have
bathed
cybele
in
the
waves
of
the
campanian
gulf
and
i
have
passed
three
moons
in
the
caverns
of
samothrace
laughing
stupidly
ah
ah
ah
at
the
mysteries
of
the
bona
dea
and
now
we
are
renewing
our
pilgrimage
we
are
going
to
the
north
the
side
of
the
swans
and
the
snows
on
the
white
plain
the
blind
hippopodes
break
with
the
ends
of
their
feet
the
ultramarine
plant
come
it
is
morning
the
cock
has
crowed
the
horse
has
neighed
the
ship
is
ready
the
cock
has
not
crowed
i
hear
the
cricket
in
the
sands
and
i
see
the
moon
which
remains
in
its
place
we
are
going
to
the
south
behind
the
mountains
and
the
huge
waves
to
seek
in
the
perfumes
for
the
cause
of
love
you
shall
inhale
the
odour
of
myrrhodion
which
makes
the
weak
die
you
shall
bathe
your
body
in
the
lake
of
pink
oil
of
the
island
of
juno
you
shall
see
sleeping
under
the
primroses
the
lizard
who
awakens
all
the
centuries
when
at
his
maturity
the
carbuncle
falls
from
his
forehead
the
stars
glitter
like
eyes
the
cascades
sing
like
lyres
an
intoxicating
fragrance
arises
from
the
opening
flowers
your
spirit
shall
expand
in
this
atmosphere
and
it
will
show
itself
in
your
heart
as
well
as
in
your
face

is
time

about
to
rise
the
swallows

us
go

not
i
i
remain
do
you
wish
me
to
show
you
the
plant
balis
which
resuscitates
the
dead
ask
him
rather
for
the
bloodstone
which
attracts
silver
iron
and
bronze
oh
how
sick

feel
how
sick
i
feel
you

understand
the
voices

will
make
you
mount
the
unicorns
the
dragons
and
the
dolphins
weeps
oh
oh
oh
you
shall
know
the
demons
who
dwell
in
the
caverns
those
who
speak
in
the
woods
those
who
move
about
in
the
waves
those
who
drive
the
clouds
fasten
your
girdle
tie
your
sandals
i
will
explain
to
you
the
reasons
for
the
shapes

most
antony
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
murmurs

damis
continues
to
run
around
him
with
wheedling
gestures
see
worthy
hermit
dear
saint
antony
pure
man
illustrious
man
man
who
can
not
be
sufficiently
praised
do
not
be
alarmed
this
is
an
exaggerated
style
of
speaking
borrowed
from
the
orientals
it
in
no
way
prevents
let
him
alone
damis
he
believes
like
a
brute
in
the
reality
of
things
the
fear
which
he
has
of
the
gods
prevents
him
from
comprehending
them
and
he
eats
his
own
words
just
like
a
jealous
king
but
you
my
son
quit
me
not
he
steps
back
to
the
verge
of
the
cliffs
passes
over
it
and
remains
there
hanging
in
above
all
forms
farther
than
the
earth
beyond
the
skies
dwells
the
world
of
ideas
entirely
filled
with
the
word
with
one
bound
we
leap
across
space
and
you
shall
grasp
in
its
infinity
the
eternal
the
absolute
being
come
give
me
your
hand
let
us
go
the
pair
side
by
side
rise
softly
into
the
air
antony
embracing
the
cross
watches
them
ascending
they
disappear
chapter
all
gods
all
religions
antony
walking
slowly
that
was
really
hell
nebuchadnezzar
did
not
dazzle
me
so
much
the
queen
of
sheba
did
not
bewitch
me
so
thoroughly
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
about
the
gods
filled
me
with
a
longing
to
know
them
i
recollect
having
seen
hundreds
of
them
at
a
time
in
the
island
of
elephantinum
in
the
reign
of
dioclesian
the
emperor
had
given
up
to
the
nomads
a
large
territory
on
condition
that
they
should
protect
the
frontiers
and
the
treaty
was
concluded
in
the
name
of
the
invisible
powers
for
the
gods
of
every
people
were
ignorant
about
other
people
the
barbarians
had
brought
forward
theirs
they
occupied
the
hillocks
of
sand
which
line
the
river
one
could
see
them
holding
their
idols
between
their
arms
like
great
paralytic
children
or
else
sailing
amid
cataracts
on
trunks
of
they
pointed
out
from
a
distance
the
amulets
on
their
necks
and
the
tattooings
on
their
breasts
and
that
is
not
more
criminal
than
the
religion
of
the
greeks
the
asiatics
and
the
romans
when
i
dwelt
in
the
temple
of
heliopolis
i
used
often
to
contemplate
all
the
objects
on
the
walls
vultures
carrying
sceptres
crocodiles
playing
on
lyres
men
faces
joined
to
serpents
bodies
women
with
cows
heads
prostrated
before
the
ithyphallic
deities
and
their
supernatural
forms
carried
me
away
into
other
worlds
i
wished
to
know
what
those
calm
eyes
were
gazing
at
in
order
that
matter
should
have
so
much
power
it
should
contain
a
spirit
the
souls
of
the
gods
are
attached
to
their
images
those
who
possess
external
beauty
may
fascinate
us
but
the
others
who
are
abject
or
terrible
how
to
believe
in
them
and
he
sees
moving
past
close
to
the
ground
leaves
stones
shells
branches
of
trees
vague
representations
of
animals
then
a
species
of
dropsical
dwarfs
these
are
gods
he
bursts
out
laughing
behind
him
he
hears
another
outburst
of
laughter
and
hilarion
presents
himself
dressed
like
a
hermit
much
bigger
than
before
in
fact
colossal
antony
is
not
surprised
at
seeing
him
again
what
a
brute
one
must
be
to
adore
a
thing
like
that
oh
yes
very
much
of
a
brute
then
advance
before
them
one
by
one
idols
of
all
nations
and
all
ages
in
wood
in
metal
in
granite
in
feathers
and
in
skins
sewn
together
the
oldest
of
them
anterior
to
the
deluge
are
lost
to
view
beneath
the
seaweed
which
hangs
from
them
like
hair
some
too
long
for
their
lower
portions
crack
in
their
joints
and
break
their
loins
while
walking
others
allow
sand
to
flow
out
through
holes
in
their
bellies
antony
and
hilarion
are
prodigiously
amused
they
hold
their
sides
from
sheer
laughter
after
this
idols
pass
with
faces
like
sheep
they
stagger
on
their
bandy
legs
open
wide
their
eyelids
and
bleat
out
like
dumb
animals
ba
ba
ba
in
proportion
as
they
approach
the
human
type
they
irritate
antony
the
more
he
strikes
them
with
his
fist
kicks
them
rushes
madly
upon
them
they
begin
to
present
a
horrible
aspect
with
high
tufts
eyes
like
bulls
arms
terminated
with
claws
and
the
jaws
of
a
shark
and
before
these
gods
men
are
slaughtered
on
altars
of
stone
while
others
are
pounded
in
vats
crushed
under
or
nailed
to
trees
there
is
one
of
them
all
in
iron
with
the
horns
of
a
bull
who
devours
children
horror
but
the
gods
always
demand
sufferings
your
own
even
has
wished
weeping
say
no
more
hold
your
tongue
the
enclosure
of
rocks
changes
into
a
valley
a
herd
of
oxen
pastures
there
on
the
shorn
grass
the
shepherd
who
has
charge
of
them
perceives
a
cloud
and
in
a
sharp
voice
pierces
the
air
with
words
of
urgent
entreaty
as
he
wants
rain
he
tries
by
his
strains
to
coerce
the
king
of
heaven
to
open
the
fruitful
cloud
laughing
this
is
too
silly
a
form
of
presumption
why
then
do
you
perform
exorcisms
the
valley
becomes
a
sea
of
milk
motionless
and
illimitable
in
the
midst
of
it
floats
a
long
cradle
formed
by
the
coils
of
a
serpent
all
whose
heads
bending
forward
at
the
same
time
overshadow
a
god
who
lies
there
asleep
he
is
young
beardless
more
beautiful
than
a
girl
and
covered
with
diaphanous
veils
the
pearls
of
his
tiara
shine
softly
like
moons
a
chaplet
of
stars
winds
itself
many
times
above
his
breast
and
with
one
hand
under
his
head
and
the
other
arm
extended
he
reposes
with
a
dreamy
and
intoxicated
air
a
woman
squatted
before
his
feet
awaits
his
awakening
this
is
the
primordial
duality
of
the
brahmans
the
absolute
not
expressing
itself
by
any
form
upon
the
navel
of
the
god
a
stalk
of
lotus
has
grown
and
in
its
calyx
appears
another
god
with
three
faces
hold
what
an
invention
father
son
and
holy
ghost
in
the
same
way
make
only
one
person
the
three
heads
are
turned
aside
and
three
immense
gods
appear
the
first
who
is
of
a
rosy
hue
bites
the
end
of
his
toe
the
second
who
is
blue
tosses
four
arms
about
the
third
who
is
green
weaves
a
necklace
of
human
skulls
immediately
in
front
of
them
rise
three
goddesses
one
wrapped
in
a
net
another
offering
a
cup
and
the
third
brandishing
a
bow
and
these
gods
these
goddesses
multiply
become
tenfold
on
their
shoulders
rise
arms
and
at
the
ends
of
their
arms
are
hands
holding
banners
axes
bucklers
swords
parasols
and
drums
fountains
spring
from
their
heads
grass
hangs
from
their
nostrils
riding
on
birds
cradled
on
palanquins
throned
on
seats
of
gold
standing
in
niches
of
ivory
they
dream
travel
command
drink
wine
and
inhale
flowers
whirl
around
giants
pursue
monsters
at
the
entrances
to
the
grottoes
solitaries
meditate
myriads
of
stars
and
clouds
of
streamers
mingle
in
an
indistinguishable
throng
peacocks
drink
from
the
streams
of
golden
dust
the
embroidery
of
the
pavilions
blends
with
the
spots
of
the
leopards
coloured
rays
cross
one
another
in
the
blue
air
amid
the
flying
of
arrows
and
the
swinging
of
censers
and
all
this
unfolds
itself
like
a
lofty
frieze
leaning
with
its
base
on
the
rocks
and
mounting
to
the
very
sky
dazzled
what
a
number
of
them
there
are
what
do
they
wish
the
one
who
is
scratching
his
abdomen
with
his
trunk
is
the
solar
god
the
inspirer
of
wisdom
that
other
whose
six
heads
carry
towers
and
fourteen
handles
of
javelins
is
the
prince
of
armies
the
the
old
man
riding
on
a
crocodile
is
going
to
bathe
the
souls
of
the
dead
on
the
seashore
they
will
be
tormented
by
this
black
woman
with
rotten
teeth
the
governess
of
hell
the
chariot
drawn
by
red
mares
which
a
legless
coachman
is
driving
is
carrying
about
in
broad
daylight
the
master
of
the
sun
the
accompanies
him
in
a
litter
drawn
by
three
gazelles
on
her
knees
on
the
back
of
a
parrot
the
goddess
of
beauty
is
presenting
her
round
breast
to
love
her
son
here
she
is
farther
on
she
leaps
with
joy
in
the
prairies
look
look
with
a
radiant
mitre
on
her
head
she
runs
over
the
cornfields
over
the
waves
mounts
into
the
air
and
exhibits
herself
everywhere
between
these
gods
sit
the
genii
of
the
winds
of
the
planets
of
the
months
of
the
days
and
a
hundred
thousand
others
and
their
aspects
are
multiplied
their
transformations
rapid
here
is
one
who
from
a
fish
has
become
a
tortoise
he
assumes
the
head
of
a
wild
boar
the
stature
of
a
dwarf
for
what
purpose
to
establish
equilibrium
to
combat
evil
life
is
exhausted
its
forms
are
used
up
and
it
is
necessary
to
progress
by
metamorphoses
of
them
suddenly
a
naked
man
appears
seated
in
the
middle
of
the
sand
with
his
legs
crossed
a
large
circle
vibrates
suspended
behind
him
the
little
curls
of
his
black
hair
deepening
into
an
azure
tint
twist
symmetrically
around
a
protuberance
at
the
top
of
his
head
his
arms
of
great
length
fall
straight
down
his
sides
his
two
hands
with
open
palms
rest
evenly
on
his
thighs
the
lower
portions
of
his
feet
present
the
figures
of
two
suns
and
he
remains
completely
motionless
in
front
of
antony
and
hilarion
with
all
the
gods
around
him
placed
at
intervals
upon
the
rocks
as
if
on
the
seats
of
a
circus
his
lips
open
and
in
a
deep
voice
he
says
i
am
the
master
of
the
great
charity
the
help
of
creatures
and
i
expound
the
law
to
believers
and
to
the
profane
alike
to
save
the
world
i
wished
to
be
born
amongst
men
the
gods
wept
when
i
went
away
at
first
i
sought
a
woman
suitable
for
the
purpose
of
warlike
race
the
spouse
of
a
king
exceedingly
virtuous
and
beautiful
with
a
deep
navel
a
body
firm
as
a
diamond
and
at
the
time
of
the
full
moon
without
the
intervention
of
any
male
i
entered
her
womb
i
came
out
through
her
right
side
then
the
stars
stopped
in
their
motions
hilarion
murmurs
between
his
teeth
when
they
saw
the
stars
stop
they
conceived
a
great
joy
antony
looks
more
attentively
at
the
buddha
who
resumes
from
the
bottom
of
the
himalaya
a
religious
centenarian
set
forth
to
see
me
man
called
simeon
who
was
not
to
die
before
he
had
seen
the
christ
they
brought
me
to
the
schools
i
knew
more
than
the
doctors
the
midst
of
the
doctors
and
all
those
who
heard
him
were
ravished
by
his
wisdom
antony
makes
a
sign
to
hilarion
to
keep
silent
i
went
continually
to
meditate
in
the
gardens
the
shadows
of
the
trees
used
to
move
but
the
shadow
of
the
one
that
sheltered
me
did
not
move
no
one
could
equal
me
in
the
knowledge
of
the
sacred
writings
the
enumeration
of
atoms
the
management
of
elephants
waxworks
astronomy
poetry
boxing
all
exercises
and
all
arts
in
compliance
with
custom
i
took
a
wife
and
i
passed
the
days
in
my
royal
palace
arrayed
in
pearls
under
a
shower
of
perfumes
fanned
by
the
of
thousand
women
and
gazing
at
my
people
from
the
tops
of
my
terraces
adorned
with
resounding
bells
but
the
sight
of
the
world
miseries
made
me
turn
aside
from
pleasures
i
fled
i
went
on
covered
with
rags
collected
in
the
sepulchres
and
as
there
was
a
very
learned
hermit
i
offered
myself
as
his
servant
i
guarded
his
door
i
washed
his
feet
all
sensation
all
joy
all
languor
were
annihilated
then
concentrating
my
thoughts
on
a
larger
field
of
meditation
i
came
to
know
the
essence
of
things
the
illusion
of
forms
i
speedily
abandoned
the
science
of
the
brakhmans
they
are
eaten
up
with
lusts
beneath
their
austere
exterior
they
anoint
themselves
with
filth
and
sleep
upon
thorns
believing
that
they
arrive
at
happiness
through
the
path
of
death
pharisees
hypocrites
whited
sepulchres
race
of
vipers
i
too
have
done
astonishing
things
eating
for
a
day
only
a
single
grain
of
rice
and
at
that
time
grains
of
rice
were
not
bigger
than
they
are
now
my
hair
fell
off
my
body
became
black
my
eyes
sunken
in
their
sockets
seemed
like
stars
seen
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
for
six
years
i
never
moved
remaining
exposed
to
flies
to
lions
and
to
serpents
and
i
subjected
myself
to
burning
suns
heavy
showers
snow
lightning
hail
and
tempest
without
even
shielding
myself
with
my
hand
the
travellers
who
passed
assuming
that
i
was
dead
flung
clods
of
earth
at
me
from
a
distance
there
only
remained
for
me
to
be
tempted
by
the
devil
i
invoked
him
his
sons
came
hideous
covered
with
scales
nauseous
as
charcoal
howling
hissing
bellowing
flinging
at
each
other
armour
and
dead
men
bones
some
of
them
spirted
out
flames
through
their
nostrils
others
spread
around
darkness
with
their
wings
others
carried
chaplets
of
fingers
that
had
been
cut
off
others
drank
the
venom
of
serpents
out
of
the
hollows
of
their
hands
they
have
the
heads
of
pigs
rhinoceroses
or
toads
all
kinds
of
figures
calculated
to
inspire
respect
or
terror
aside
i
endured
that
myself
in
former
times
then
he
sent
me
his
daughters
beautiful
with
golden
girdles
teeth
white
as
the
jasmine
and
limbs
round
as
an
elephant
trunk
some
of
them
stretched
up
their
arms
when
they
yawned
to
display
the
dimples
in
their
elbows
others
blinked
their
eyes
others
began
to
laugh
and
others
unfastened
one
another
garments
amongst
them
were
blushing
virgins
matrons
full
of
pride
and
queens
with
great
trains
of
baggage
and
attendants
ah
that
also
having
vanquished
the
demon
i
passed
twelve
years
in
nourishing
myself
exclusively
on
perfumes
and
as
i
had
acquired
the
five
virtues
the
five
faculties
the
ten
forces
the
eighteen
substances
and
penetrated
into
the
four
spheres
of
the
invisible
world
the
intelligence
was
mine
and
i
became
the
buddha
all
the
gods
bow
down
those
who
have
many
heads
lower
them
all
at
the
same
time
he
raises
his
hand
on
high
in
the
air
and
resumes
in
view
of
the
deliverance
of
beings
i
have
made
hundreds
of
thousands
of
sacrifices
i
have
given
to
the
poor
robes
of
silk
beds
chariots
houses
heaps
of
gold
and
diamonds
i
have
given
my
hands
to
the
my
legs
to
the
lame
my
eyes
to
the
blind
i
have
cut
off
my
head
for
the
decapitated
at
the
time
when
i
was
king
i
distributed
the
provinces
at
the
time
when
i
was
brakhman
i
despised
nobody
when
i
was
a
solitary
i
spoke
words
of
tenderness
to
the
thief
who
tried
to
cut
my
throat
when
i
was
a
tiger
i
let
myself
die
of
hunger
and
in
this
final
stage
of
existence
having
preached
the
law
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
the
great
period
is
accomplished
the
men
the
animals
the
gods
the
bamboos
the
oceans
the
mountains
the
grains
of
sand
of
the
ganges
with
the
myriads
of
myriads
of
stars
everything
must
perish
and
until
the
new
births
a
flame
will
dance
on
the
ruins
of
a
overthrow
then
a
vertigo
seizes
the
gods
they
stagger
fall
into
convulsions
and
vomit
forth
their
existences
their
crowns
break
to
pieces
their
standards
fly
away
they
get
rid
of
their
attributes
and
their
sexes
fling
over
their
shoulders
the
cups
from
which
they
drink
immortality
strangle
themselves
with
their
serpents
and
vanish
in
smoke
and
when
they
have
all
disappeared
slowly
you
have
just
seen
the
creed
of
many
hundreds
of
millions
of
men
antony
is
on
the
earth
his
face
in
his
hands
standing
close
to
him
and
turning
his
back
to
the
cross
hilarion
watches
him
a
rather
lengthened
period
elapses
then
a
singular
being
appears
with
the
head
of
a
man
and
the
body
of
a
fish
he
advances
straight
through
the
air
tossing
the
sand
with
his
tail
and
his
patriarchal
face
and
his
little
arms
make
antony
laugh
in
a
plaintive
voice
treat
me
with
respect
i
am
the
contemporary
of
the
beginning
of
things
i
have
dwelt
in
the
shapeless
world
where
slumbered
hermaphrodite
animals
under
the
weight
of
an
opaque
atmosphere
in
the
depths
of
gloomy
waves
when
the
fingers
the
fins
and
the
wings
were
confounded
and
eyes
without
heads
floated
like
molluscs
amongst
bulls
and
serpents
over
the
whole
of
those
beings
omoroca
bent
like
a
hoop
stretched
her
woman
body
but
belus
cut
her
clean
in
two
halves
made
the
earth
with
one
and
the
heavens
with
another
and
the
two
worlds
alike
mutually
contemplate
each
other
i
the
first
consciousness
of
chaos
i
have
arisen
from
the
abyss
to
harden
matter
to
regulate
forms
and
i
have
taught
men
fishing
the
sowing
of
seed
the
scripture
and
the
history
of
the
gods
since
then
i
live
in
the
ponds
that
remained
after
the
deluge
but
the
desert
grows
larger
around
them
the
wind
flings
sand
into
them
the
sun
consumes
them
and
i
expire
on
my
bed
of
lemon
while
gazing
across
the
water
at
the
stars
thither
am
i
returning
he
makes
a
plunge
and
disappears
in
the
nile
this
is
an
ancient
god
of
the
chaldeans
ironically
who
then
were
the
gods
of
babylon
you
can
see
them
and
they
find
themselves
upon
the
platform
of
a
quadrangular
tower
rising
above
other
towers
which
growing
narrower
in
proportion
as
they
rise
form
a
monstrous
pyramid
you
may
distinguish
below
a
great
black
mass
the
city
without
doubt
stretching
along
the
plain
the
air
is
cold
the
sky
is
of
a
sombre
blue
the
multitudinous
stars
palpitate
in
the
middle
of
the
platform
stands
a
column
of
white
stone
priests
in
linen
robes
pass
and
return
all
round
so
as
to
describe
in
their
evolutions
a
moving
circle
and
with
heads
raised
they
contemplate
the
stars
hilarion
points
out
several
of
them
to
saint
antony
there
are
thirty
chief
priests
fifteen
gaze
upon
the
region
above
the
earth
and
fifteen
on
the
region
below
it
at
regular
intervals
one
of
them
rushes
from
the
upper
regions
to
the
lower
whilst
another
abandons
the
lower
to
mount
towards
the
empyrean
of
the
seven
planets
two
are
benevolent
two
malevolent
and
three
ambiguous
everything
in
the
world
depends
on
these
eternal
fires
according
to
their
position
and
their
movements
one
may
draw
prognostications
and
you
are
now
treading
on
the
most
sacred
spot
on
earth
there
pythagoras
and
zoroaster
may
be
met
two
thousand
years
have
these
men
been
observing
the
sky
the
better
to
comprehend
the
gods
the
stars
are
not
gods
yes
say
they
for
while
things
are
continually
passing
around
us
the
sky
like
eternity
remains
unchangeable
nevertheless
it
has
a
master
pointing
at
the
column
that
is
belus
the
first
ray
the
sun
the
male
the
other
which
is
fruitful
is
under
him
antony
observes
a
garden
lighted
up
with
lamps
he
is
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
in
an
avenue
of
to
right
and
left
little
paths
lead
towards
huts
erected
in
a
wood
of
which
protect
lattices
of
reeds
the
men
for
the
most
part
have
pointed
caps
with
laced
robes
like
the
plumage
of
peacocks
there
are
people
from
the
north
clad
in
bearskins
nomads
in
brown
woollen
cloaks
pale
gangarides
with
long
and
the
classes
like
the
nationalities
appear
to
be
confused
for
sailors
and
jostle
against
princes
wearing
tiaras
of
carbuncles
and
carrying
large
with
carved
heads
all
hurry
forward
with
dilated
nostrils
filled
with
the
same
desire
from
time
to
time
they
got
out
of
the
way
in
order
to
allow
a
long
covered
chariot
drawn
by
oxen
to
pass
or
perhaps
it
is
an
ass
jolting
on
his
back
a
woman
closely
veiled
who
also
disappears
in
the
direction
of
the
huts
antony
is
frightened
he
desires
to
turn
back
however
an
inexpressible
curiosity
leads
him
on
beneath
the
women
are
squatted
in
rows
upon
deerskins
each
of
them
having
for
a
diadem
a
plait
of
cords
some
of
them
magnificently
attired
address
the
in
loud
tones
the
more
timid
keep
their
features
hidden
between
their
hands
whilst
from
behind
a
matron
no
doubt
their
mother
encourages
them
others
with
heads
enveloped
in
black
shawls
and
the
rest
of
their
bodies
quite
nude
seem
at
a
distance
like
statues
of
flesh
as
soon
as
a
man
flings
money
on
their
knees
they
rise
and
one
can
hear
kisses
amid
the
foliage
and
sometimes
a
great
bitter
cry
those
are
the
virgins
of
babylon
who
prostitute
themselves
to
the
goddess
what
goddess
there
she
is
and
he
shows
antony
at
the
very
end
of
the
avenue
on
the
threshold
of
an
illuminated
grotto
a
block
of
stone
representing
a
woman
infamy
what
an
abomination
to
give
a
sex
to
god
you
conceive
him
surely
as
a
living
person
once
more
antony
finds
himself
in
darkness
he
perceives
in
the
air
a
luminous
circle
placed
on
horizontal
wings
this
species
of
ring
surrounds
like
a
girdle
that
is
too
loose
the
figure
of
a
small
man
with
a
mitre
on
his
head
and
a
crown
in
his
hand
the
lower
part
of
whose
body
is
shut
out
from
view
by
the
huge
feathers
exhibited
in
his
kilt
this
is
ormuz
the
god
of
the
persians
he
flutters
while
he
exclaims
i
am
terrified
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
mouth
i
have
vanquished
thee
ahriman
but
thou
art
beginning
again
at
first
revolting
against
me
thou
didst
destroy
the
eldest
of
creatures
kaiomortz
the
then
thou
didst
seduce
the
first
human
pair
meschia
and
meschiana
and
didst
fill
their
hearts
with
darkness
and
press
forward
thy
battalions
towards
heaven
i
had
my
own
the
inhabitants
of
the
stars
and
i
gazed
down
from
my
throne
on
all
the
planets
in
their
different
spheres
mithra
my
son
dwelt
in
an
inaccessible
spot
there
he
received
souls
and
sent
them
forth
and
each
morning
he
arose
to
pour
out
his
riches
the
splendour
of
the
firmament
was
reflected
by
the
earth
the
fire
shone
on
the
mountains
image
of
the
other
fire
with
which
i
have
created
all
beings
to
secure
it
from
defilement
they
did
not
burn
the
dead
who
were
transported
to
heaven
on
the
beaks
of
birds
i
have
regulated
pasturages
labours
the
wood
of
sacrifice
the
forms
of
cups
the
words
that
must
be
uttered
in
insomnia
and
my
priests
prayed
continually
in
order
that
their
worship
should
correspond
to
the
eternity
of
god
they
purified
themselves
with
water
they
offered
up
loaves
on
the
altars
they
confessed
their
sins
in
loud
tones
homa
gave
himself
to
men
to
drink
in

to
communicate
his
strength
to
them
while
the
genii
of
heaven
were
fighting
the
demons
the
children
of
iran
chased
the
serpents
the
king
whom
a
countless
train
of
courtiers
served
on
bended
knees
was
attired
so
as
to
resemble
me
in
person
and
wore
my
his
gardens
had
the
magnificence
of
a
celestial
earth
and
his
tomb
represented
him
slaying
a
monster
emblem
of
the
good
which
exterminates
evil
for
one
day
it
came
to
pass
thanks
to
the
endless
course
of
time
that
i
triumphed
over
ahriman
but
the
interval
that
separates
us

disappearing
the

the
master
hilarion
behind
antony
restrains
an
exclamation
of
joy
and
ormuz
plunges
into
the
darkness
then
appears
the
great
diana
of
ephesus
black
with
enamelled
eyes
elbows
at
her
sides
forearms
turned
out
and
hands
open
lions
crouch
upon
her
shoulders
fruits
flowers
and
stars
cross
one
another
upon
her
chest
further
down
three
rows
of
breasts
exhibit
themselves
and
from
the
belly
to
the
feet
she
is
caught
in
a
close
sheath
from
which
sprout
forth
in
the
centre
of
her
body
bulls
stags
griffins
and
bees
she
is
seen
in
the
white
gleaming
caused
by
a
disc
of
silver
round
as
the
full
moon
placed
behind
her
head
where
is
my
temple
where
are
my
amazons
how
is
it
with
me
me
the
incorruptible
that
i
find
myself
so
impotent
her
flowers
wither
her
fruits
hang
loose
the
lions
and
the
bulls
bow
down
their
necks
the
stags
exhausted
begin
to
pant
the
bees
with
a
faint
buzzing
fall
dying
upon
the
ground
she
presses
her
breasts
one
after
the
other
they
are
empty
but
yielding
to
a
desperate
pressure
her
sheath
bursts
open
she
clutches
the
end
of
it
like
the
skirt
of
a
dress
flings
into
it
her
animals
and
her
then
goes
back
into
the
darkness
and
in
the
distance
voices
murmur
grumble
roar
cry
or
bellow
the
density
of
the
night
is
increased
by
the
winds
a
warm
shower
begins
to
fall
in
heavy
drops
how
pleasant
is
this
odour
of
this
rustling
of
green
leaves
this
transparency
of
fountains
i
would
like
to
lie
down
flat
upon
the
ground
in
order
to
feel
it
close
to
my
heart
and
my
life
would
be
renewed
in
eternal
youth
he
hears
the
sound
of
castanets
and
cymbals
and
in
the
midst
of
a
rustic
crowd
men
clad
in
white
tunics
with
red
bands
lead
out
an
ass
richly
harnessed
his
tail
adorned
with
ribands
and
his
hoofs
painted
a
box
covered
with
a
of
yellow
linen
sways
to
and
fro
upon
his
back
between
two
baskets
one
of
which
receives
the
offerings
deposited
there
eggs
grapes
pears
cheeses
poultry
and
small
coins
while
the
second
is
full
of
roses
which
the
drivers
of
the
ass
scatter
before
him
as
they
move
along
the

pendants
in
their
ears
large
cloaks
plaited

and

their
cheeks
painted

of

has
an
olive
crown
fastened
around

by

in

whose

of
which
overshadow
a
little
sheep
the

stops

is
removed

underneath
appears
a
second
covering
of
black
felt
then
one
of
the
men
in
a
white
tunic
begins
to
dance
while
playing
upon
castanets
while
another
on
his
knees
before
the
box
beats
a
tambourine
and
the

of
the
band
commences

mother

she
procures

out
to

in

often
sleep
in

in
the
blue
ether
more
circumambient
than

she
surrounds
the

her
respiration
is
exhaled
through
the
nostrils
of
tigers
her
voice
growls
beneath
the
volcanoes
her
anger
is
the
storm
and
the
pallor
of
her
face

made
the

she
swells
out

her
something
for

avaricious
the
box
flies
open
and
beneath
an
awning
of
blue
silk
is
seen
a
little
image
of
cybele
glittering
with
spangles
crowned
with
towers
and
seated
on
a
chariot
of
red
stone
drawn
by

howling
of
wolves
the
echoing
mountains
and
the
deep
gorges
the
flower
of
the
the
pomegranate
and
the
green
figs
the
whirling
dance
the
flute
the
sweet
sap
the
salt

blood
help
help
mother
of
mountains
they
flagellate
themselves
with
their
whips
and
the
strokes
resound
on
their
breasts
the
skins
of
the
tambourines
vibrate
till
they
almost
burst
they
seize
their
knives
and
inflict
gashes
on
their
arms
she
is
sad
let
us
be
sad
he
who
is
doomed
to
suffer
must
weep
in
that
way
your
sins
will
be
remitted
blood
washes
out
everything
shed
drops
of
it
around
then
like
flowers
she
demands
that
of
another
of
one
who
is
pure
the
raises
his
knife
above
the
sheep
seized
with
horror
do
slaughter
the
lamb
a
purple
flood
gushes
forth
the
priests
sprinkle
the
crowd
with
it
and
all
including
antony
and
hilarion
ranged
around
the
burning
tree
silently
watch
the
last
palpitations
of
the
victim
from
the
midst
of
the
priests
comes
a
woman
exactly
like
the
image
enclosed
in
the
little
box
she
stops
on
seeing
a
young
man
in
a
phrygian
cap
his
thighs
are
covered
with
breeches
opened
here
and
there
by
lozenges
which
are
fastened
with
coloured
bows
he
rests
his
elbows
against
one
of
the
branches
of
the
tree
holding
a
flute
in
his
hand
in
a
languishing
attitude
encircling
his
figure
with
her
arms
to
rejoin
thee
i
have
travelled
through
every
region
and
famine
ravaged
the
fields
thou
hast
deceived
me
no
matter
i
love
thee
warm
my
body
let
us
unite
the
will
return
no
more
o
eternal
mother
despite
my
love
it
is
not
possible
to
penetrate
thy
essence
i
should
like
to
cover
myself
with
a
coloured
robe
like
thine
i
envy
thy
breasts
swollen
with
milk
the
length
of
thy
tresses
thy
mighty
sides
from
which
spring
living
creatures
would
that
i
were
like
thee
would
that
i
were
woman
but
no
that
can
never
be
my
virility
fills
me
with
horror
with
a
sharp
stone
he
mutilates
himself
then
he
begins
to
run
madly
around
the
priests
imitate
the
god
the
faithful
the
priests
men
and
women
exchange
their
garments
and
embrace
one
another
and
this
whirlwind
of
flesh
hurries
away
whilst
the
voices
ever
continuing
become
more
clamorous
and
shrill
like
those
one
hears
at
funerals
a
great
catafalque
hung
with
purple
carries
on
its
summit
a
bed
of
ebony
surrounded
by
torches
and
baskets
of
silver
filigree
in
which
are
contained
green
lettuces
mallows
and
fennel
upon
the
seats
above
and
below
are
seated
women
all
attired
in
black
with
girdles
undone
and
naked
feet
and
holding
with
a
melancholy
air
huge
bouquets
of
flowers
on
the
ground
at
the
corners
of
the
platform
alabaster
urns
filled
with
myrrh
are
sending
up
light
wreaths
of
smoke
on
the
bed
may
be
seen
the
corpse
of
a
man
blood
trickles
from
his
thigh
his
arm
is
hanging
down
and
a
dog
who
is
howling
licks
his
nails
the
line
of
torches
placed
too
close
to
one
another
prevents
his
figure
from
being
completely
visible
antony
is
seized
with
anguish
he
is
afraid
of
seeing
the
face
of
some
one
he
knew
the
women
cease
their
sobbing
and
after
an
interval
of
silence
all
at
the
same
time
burst
into
a
psalm
beautiful
beautiful
he
is
beautiful
enough
of
sleep
raise
his
head
up
inhale
our
bouquets
these
are
narcissi
and
anemones
gathered
in
thy
gardens
to
please
thee
return
to
life
thou
fillest
us
with
fear
speak
what
dost
thou
require
dost
thou
wish
to
drink
wine
dost
thou
wish
to
sleep
in
our
beds
dost
thou
wish
to
eat
the
which
have
the
form
of
little
birds
let
us
press
close
to
his
hips
let
us
kiss
his
breast
hold
hold
feel
thou
our
fingers
covered
with
rings
which
are
stealing
over
thy
body
and
our
lips
which
are
seeking
thy
mouth
and
our
hair
which
is
sweeping
thy
legs
insensible
god
deaf
to
our
prayers
they
burst
into
shrieks
tearing
their
faces
with
their
nails
then
become
silent
and
only
the
howling
of
the
dog
is
heard
alas
alas
the
dark
blood
rushes
over
his
snowy
flesh
see
how
his
knees
writhe
how
his
sides
give
way
the
flowers
upon
his
face
have
soaked
the
gore
he
is
dead
let
us
weep
let
us
lament
they
come
all
in
a
row
to
fling
down
between
the
torches
their
flowing
locks
resembling
at
a
distance
black
or
yellow
serpents
and
the
catafalque
is
softly
lowered
to
the
level
of
a
cave
a
gloomy
sepulchre
which
is
yawning
in
the
background
then
a
woman
bends
over
the
corpse
her
hair
which
never
has
been
cut
covers
her
from
head
to
foot
she
sheds
so
many
tears
that
her
grief
does
not
seem
to
be
like
that
of
others
but
superhuman
infinite
antony
thinks
of
the
mother
of
jesus
she
says
thou
didst
escape
from
the
east
and
thou
didst
press
me
in
thy
arms
all
quivering
with
dew
o
sun
doves
fluttered
above
the
azure
of
thy
mantle
our
kisses
caused
breezes
amid
the
foliage
and
i
abandoned
myself
to
thy
love
delighting
in
the
exquisite
sensation
of
my
own
weakness
alas
alas
why
art
thou
about
to
rush
away
over
the
mountains
at
the
autumnal
equinox
a
wild
boar
wounded
thee
thou
art
dead
and
the
fountains
weep
and
the
trees
droop
and
the
winter
wind
is
whistling
through
the
leafless
branches
my
eyes
are
about
to
close
seeing
that
darkness
is
covering
thee
by
this
time
thou
art
dwelling
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
near
my
more
powerful
rival
o
persephone
all
that
is
beautiful
goes
down
to
thee
and
returns
no
more
while
she
has
been
speaking
her
companions
have
taken
the
dead
body
to
lower
it
into
the
sepulchre
it
remains
in
their
hands
it
was
only
a
corpse
of
wax
antony
experiences
a
kind
of
relief
the
whole
scene
vanishes
and
the
cell
the
rocks
and
the
cross
reappear
and
now
he
distinguishes
on
the
other
side
of
the
nile
a
woman
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
she
holds
with
her
hand
the
end
of
a
long
black
veil
which
conceals
her
figure
while
she
carries
on
her
left
arm
a
little
child
which
she
is
suckling
at
her
side
a
huge
ape
is
squatted
on
the
sand
she
lifts
her
head
towards
the
sky

in

of
the

her

and

heard
the

the
harvests
the
thrashing
of

and
the

in

with

changes

seasons
in

nights

the
great
stars

forth
their
beams
the
days
were
steeped
in
an
unchanging
splendour
the
sun
and
the

were
seen
like
a
royal
pair
on

were
enthroned
in

the
crash
of

did
not
change
our
attitude
egypt
lay
stretched
beneath
us
monumental
and
solemn
long
like
the
corridor
of
a
temple
with
obelisks
at
the
right
pyramids
at
the
left
its
labyrinth
in
the
middle
and
everywhere
avenues
of
monsters
forests
of
columns
massive
archways
flanking
gates
which
have
for
their
summit
the
earth
sphere
between
two
wings
the
animals
of
her
zodiac
found
their
counterparts
in
her
plains
and
with
their
forms
and
colours
filled
her
mysterious
writings
divided
into
twelve
regions
as
the
year
is
into
twelve
months
each
month
each
day
having
its
god
she
reproduced
the
immutable
order
of
the
heavens
and
man
though
he
died
did
not
lose
his
lineaments
but
saturated
with
perfumes
and
becoming
imperishable
he
went
to
sleep
for
three
thousand
years
in
a
silent
egypt
the
latter
greater
than
the
other
spread
out
beneath
the
earth
thither
one
descended
by
means
of
staircases
leading
to
halls
where
were
reproduced
the
joys
of
the
good
the
tortures
of
the
wicked
everything
that
takes
place
in
the
third
invisible
world
ranged
along
the
walls
the
dead
in
painted
coffins
awaited
each
their
turn
and
the
soul
free
from
migrations
continued
its
sleep
till
it
awakened
in
another
life
meanwhile
osiris
sometimes
came
back
to
see
me
his
shade
made
me
the
mother
of
harpocrates
she
gazes
on
the
child
it
is
he
those
are
his
eyes
those
are
his
tresses
curling
like
a
ram
horns
thou
shalt
begin
his
works
over
again
we
shall
bloom
afresh

let
the

obscure
thy
face
the
breath
of
typhon
devours
the

just
now
i
have
seen
the
sphinx
fly
away
he
galloped
off
like
a
jackal
i
am
seeking
for
my
priests
my
priests
in
their
linen
robes
with
great
harps
carrying
along
a
mystic
skiff
ornamented
with
pateræ
of
silver
no
more
feasts
on

no
more
illuminations
in

no

for
a

egypt
egypt
thy
great
immovable
gods
have
their
shoulders
whitened
by
the
dung
of
birds
and
the
wind
as
it
passes
along
the
desert
carries
with
it
the
ashes
of

dead
anubis
protector
of
shadows
do
not
leave
me
the
cynocephalus
vanishes
she
gives
her
child
a
shaking
but
what
aileth
thee
thy
hands
are
cold
thy
head
fallen
back
harpocrates
has
just
died
then
she
utters
a
cry
so
bitter
mournful
and
heartrending
that
antony
replies
to
it
by
another
cry
while
he
opens
his
arms
to
support
her
she
is
no
longer
there
he
hangs
his
head
overwhelmed
with
shame
all
that
he
has
just
seen
becomes
confused
in
his
mind
it
is
like
the
stunning
effect
of
a
voyage
the
uncomfortable
sensation
of
drunkenness
fain
would
he
hate
and
yet
a
vague
pity
softens
his
heart
he
begins
to
weep
abundantly
what
is
it
now
that
makes
you
sad
after
questioning
himself
for
a
long
time
i
am
thinking
of
all
the
souls
lost
through
these
false
gods
do
you
not
find
that
they
have
in
some
respects
resemblances
to
the
true
this
is
a
trick
of
the
devil
the
better
to
seduce
the
faithful
he
attacks
the
strong
through
the
spirit
and
the
others
through
the
flesh
but
lust
in
its
furies
possesses
the
disinterestedness
of
penitence
the
frantic
love
of
the
body
accelerates
its
destruction
and
by
its
weakness
proclaims
the
extent
of
the
impossible
how
is
it
that
this
affects
me
my
heart
revolts
with
disgust
against
those
brutish
gods
always
occupied
with
carnage
and
incest
recall
to
yourself
in
the
scriptures
all
the
things
that
scandalise
you
because
you
can
not
understand
them
in
the
same
way
these
gods
under
the
outward
form
of
criminals
may
contain
the
truth
there
are
some
of
them
left
to
see
turn
aside
no
no
it
is
a
peril
a
moment
ago
you
wished
to
make
their
acquaintance
do
falsehoods
make
your
faith
totter
what
do
you
fear
the
rocks
in
front
of
antony
have
become
a
mountain
a
range
of
clouds
intersects
it
from
the
top
and
overhead
appears
another
mountain
enormous
quite
green

hollows
out
the
valley
unevenly

on
its
summit

around
her
a
halo
of
brilliant
and
all
the
rest
of
olympus
is
bathed
in
a
rosy
dawn
which
by
insensible
degrees
reaches
the
heights
of
the
azure
sky
ah
my
bosom
dilates
a
joy
which
i
can
not
analyse
descends
into
the
depths
of
my
soul
how
beautiful
it
is
how
beautiful
it
is
they
stooped
down
from
the
height
of
the
clouds
to
direct
the
swords
you
might
meet
them
on
the
roadsides
you
kept
them
in
your
home
and
this
familiarity
made
life
divine
her
only
aim
was
to
be
free
and
beautiful
her
ample
robes
rendered
her
movements
more
graceful

quite

the
most
religious
action
was
to
expose
pure
forms
those
men
too
respected

the
aged
and
suppliants
behind
the

an

immolate

troubled

there

all
at

he
repeats
the
creed

as
he
recollects
it
emitting
after
each
phrase
a

sigh
believe
in

in

becomes

it
casts
a
shadow
over

of

olympus
vanishes
antony
distinguishes
near
its
base
half
lost
in
the
caverns

supporting
the
stones
on
their
shoulders
huge
bodies
chained
these
are
the
titans
the
giants
the
hecatonchires
and
the
cyclops
a
voice
rises
indistinct
and
formidable
like
the
murmur
of
the
waves
like
the
sound
heard
in
woods
during
a
storm
like
the
roaring
of
the
wind
down
a
precipice
we
knew
it
we
of
all
others
the
gods
were
doomed
to
die
uranus
was
mutilated
by
saturn
and
saturn
by
jupiter
he
will
be
himself
annihilated
each
in
its
turn
it
is
destiny
and
by
degrees
they
plunge
into
the
mountain
and
disappear
meanwhile
the
roof
of
the
palace
of
gold
flies
away
jupiter
descends
from
his
throne
the
thunder
at
his
feet
smokes
like
a
brand
that
is
almost
extinguished
and
the
eagle
stretching
its
neck
gathers
with
its
beak
its
falling
plumes
so
then
i
am
no
longer
the
master
of
things
god
of
the
phratriæ
and
of
the
greek
peoples
ancestor
of

what
breath
of

has
driven
thee
to
me
or
flying

dost
thou
bring
to
me
the
soul
of
the
last
of
the
emperors
i
no
longer
desire
those
of
men
let
the
earth
guard
them
and
let
them
be
moved
on
a
level
with
its
baseness
they
now
have
hearts
of
slaves
they
forget
injuries
ancestors
oaths
and
everywhere
the
folly
of
mobs
the
mediocrity
of
the
individual
and
the
hideousness
of
races
reign
supreme
his
respiration
makes
his
sides
swell
even
to
bursting
and
he
writhes
with
his
hands
hebe
in
tears
presents
a
cup
to
him
he
seizes
it
no
no
as
long
as
there
will
be
no
matter
where
a
head
enclosing
thought
which
hates
disorder
and
realises
the
idea
of
law
the
spirit
of
jupiter
will
live
but
the
cup
is
empty
he
turns
it
around
slowly
on
his
not
a
drop
when
ambrosia
fails
there
is
an
end
of
the
immortals
it
slips
out
of
his
hand
and
he
leans
against
a
pillar
feeling
that
he
is
dying
there
was
no
need
of
so
many
loves
eagle
bull
swan
golden
shower
cloud
and

thou
hast
assumed
every
form
scattered
thy
light
in
every
element
hidden
thy
head
on
every
couch
this
time
the
divorce
is
irrevocable
and
our
sway
our
very
existence
is
dissolved
she
rushes
away
into
the
air
minerva
no
longer
has
her
spear
and
the
ravens
which
nestled
in
the
sculptures
of
the
frieze
whirl
round
her
and
bite
at
her
helmet
let
me
see
whether
my
vessels
cleaving
the
shining
sea
have
returned
into
my
three
ports
wherefore
the
fields
are
deserted
and
what
the
daughters
of
athens
are
now
doing
in
the
month
of
hecatombæon
all
my
people
came
to
me
led
by
their
magistrates
and
priests
then
in
white
robes
with
chitons
of
gold
the
long
files
of
virgins
advanced
holding
cups
baskets
and
parasols
then
the
three
hundred
oxen
for
the
sacrifice
old
men
shaking
green
boughs
soldiers
clashing
their
armour
against
each
other
youths
singing
hymns
players
on
the
flute
and
on
the
lyre
rhapsodists
and
and
finally
on
the
mast
of
a
trireme
supported
by
coils
of
rope
my
great
veil
embroidered
by
virgins
who
for
the
space
of
a
year
had
been
nourished
in
a
particular
fashion
and
when
it
had
been
shown
in
every
street
in
every
square
and
before
every
temple
in
the
midst
of
a
procession
continually
chanting
it
ascended
to
the
acropolis
brushed
passed
the
propylæum
and
entered
the
parthenon
but
a
difficulty
faces
me
me
the
ingenious
one
what
what
not
a
single
idea
here
am
i
more
terrified
than
a
woman
she
perceives
behind
her
a
ruin
utters
a
cry
and
struck
on
the
forehead
falls
backward
to
the
ground
hercules
has
cast
off
his
lion
skin
and
resting
on
his
feet
bending
his
back
and
biting
his
lips
he
makes
desperate
efforts
to
sustain
olympus
which
is
toppling
down
i
have
vanquished
the
cercopes
the
amazons
and
the
centaurs
i
have
slain
many
kings
i
have
broken
the
horn
of
achelous
a
great
river
i
have
cut
through
mountains
i
have
brought
oceans
together
i
have
liberated
enslaved
nations
i
have
peopled
uninhabited
countries
i
have
travelled
over
gaul
i
have
traversed
the
desert
where
one
feels
thirst
i
have
defended
the
gods
and
i
have
freed
myself
from
omphale
but
olympus
is
too
heavy
my
arms
are
growing
feeble
i
am
dying
he
is
crushed
beneath
the
ruins
it
is
thine
own
fault
amphitrionades
why
didst
thou
descend
into
my
realms
the
vulture
who
devours
the
entrails
of
tityus
has
raised
its
head
tantalus
has
had
his
lips
moistened
and
ixion
wheel
is
stopped
meanwhile
the
keres
stretch
forth
their
nails
to
detain
the
souls
the
furies
in
despair
twist
the
serpents
in
their
locks
and
cerberus
fastened
by
thee
with
a
chain
has
a
rattling
in
the
throat
while
he
slavers
from
his
three
mouths
thou
didst
leave
the
gate
ajar
others
have
come
the
light
of
human
day
has
penetrated
tartarus
he
sinks
into
the
darkness
my
trident
no
longer
raises
tempests
the
monsters
who
caused
terror
have
rotted
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
amphitrite
whose
white
feet
rushed
over
the
foam
the
green
nereids
who
could
be
seen
on
the
horizon
the
scaly
sirens
who
used
to
stop
the
ships
to
tell
stories
and
the
old
tritons
who
used
to
blow
into
shells
all
are
dead
the
gaiety
of
the
sea
has
vanished
i
will
not
survive
it
let
the
vast
ocean
cover
me
he
disappears
into
the
azure
attired
in
black
among
her
dogs
who
have
become
wolves
the
freedom
of
great
woods
intoxicated
me
with
its
odour
of
deer
and
exhalations
of
swamps
the
women
over
whose
pregnancy
i
watched
bring
dead
children
into
the
world
the
moon
trembles
under
the
incantations
of
sorcerers
i
am
filled
with
violent
and
boundless
desires
i
long
to
drink
poisons
to
lose
myself
in
vapours
or
in
dreams
and
a
passing
cloud
bears
her
away
and
at
first
i
fought
provoking
by
insults
an
entire
army
indifferent
to
countries
and
for
the
pleasure
of
carnage
then
i
had
companions
they
marched
to
the
sound
of
flutes
in
good
order
with
even
step
breathing
upon
their
bucklers
with
lofty
plume
and
slanting
spear
we
flung
ourselves
into
the
battle
with
loud
cries
like
those
of
eagles
war
was
as
joyous
as
a
feast
three
hundred
men
withstood
all
asia
but
they
returned
those
barbarians
and
in
tens
of
thousands
nay
in
millions
since
numbers
and
strategy
are
more
powerful
it
is
better
to
make
an
end
of
it
like
a
brave
man
he
kills
himself
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
limbs
with
a
sponge
the
world
is
getting
cold
it
is
necessary
to
heat
the
springs
the
volcanoes
and
the
rivers
which
run
from
metals
under
the
earth
strike
harder
with
vigorous
arm
with
all
your
strength
the
cabiri
hurt
themselves
with
their
hammers
blind
themselves
with
the
sparks
and
groping
their
way
along
are
lost
in
the
shadow
standing
in
her
chariot
which
is
drawn
by
wheels
having
wings
in
their
naves
stop
stop
they
had
good
reason
to
exclude
the
strangers
the
atheists
the
epicureans
and
the
christians
the
mystery
of
the
basket
is
unveiled
the
sanctuary
profaned
all
is
lost
she
descends
with
a
rapid
fall
bursting
into
exclamation
of
despair
and
dragging
back
the
horses
ah
falsehood
daira
is
not
given
up
to
me
the
brazen
bell
calls
me
to
the
dead
it
is
another
kind
of
tartarus
there
is
no
returning
from
it
horror
the
abyss
swallows
her
up
laughing
frantically
what
does
it
matter
the
wife
of
archontes
is
my
spouse
even
the
law
goes
down
before
drunkenness
for
me
the
new
song
and
the
multiplied
forms
the
fire
which
consumed
my
mother
runs
in
my
veins
let
it
burn
the
stronger
even
though
i
perish
male
and
female
good
for
both
i
deliver
myself
to
ye
bacchantes
i
deliver
myself
to
ye
bacchantes
and
the
vine
will
twist
around
the
trunks
of
trees
howl
dance
writhe
unbind
the
tiger
and
the
slave
bite
the
flesh
with
ferocious
teeth
and

bacchus
lashing
his
coursers
whose
glistening
hairs
fly
off
i
have
left
behind
me
delos
the
stony
so
empty
that
everything
there
now
seems
dead
and
i
am
striving
to
reach
the
delphian
oracle
before
its
inspiring
vapour
should
be
completely
lost
the
mules
browse
on
its
laurel
the
pythoness
gone
astray
is
found
there
no
longer
by
a
stronger
concentration
i
will
have
sublime
poems
eternal
monuments
and
all
matter
will
be
penetrated
with
the
vibrations
of
my
cithara
he
fingers
its
chords
they
break
and
snap
against
his
face
he
flings
down
the
instrument
and
driving
his
chariot
furiously
no
enough
of
forms
farther
still
to
the
very
summit
to
the
world
of
pure
thought
but
the
horses
falling
back
begin
to
prance
so
that
the
chariot
is
smashed
and
entangled
in
the
fragments
of
the
pole
and
the
knottings
of
the
horses

falls
into
the
abyss
the
sky

darkened

cold
shivers
i
covered
with
my
girdle
the
entire
horizon

hellas
its
fields
shone
with
the
roses
of
my
cheeks
its
shores
were
cut
according
to
the
form
of
my
lips
and
its
mountains
whiter
than
my
doves
palpitated
under
the
hands
of
the
sculptors
my
spirit
showed
itself
in
the
order
of
festivities
the
arrangements
of
the
dialogues
of
philosophers
and
the
constitution
of
republics
but
i
have
loved
men
too
much
it
is
love
that
has
dishonoured
me
she
falls
back
in

the
world
is
abominable
my

the
lack

me

places
a

upon

topples
over

nothing

of

they
ate
the

they
are
cold
the
snow
wears
down
their

and
their
feet
are
exposed
through
the
rents
in
their
sandals
they
mourn
for
the
meadows
where
upon
hillocks
of
grass
they
used
to
recover
breath
in
the
battle
the
long
ships
whose
prows
cut
through
the
mountains
of
ice
and
the
skates
they
used
in

lowers
his
glance
to
the
opposite
side
and
he
perceives
outlining
themselves
in
black
upon

strange

with
and
gauntlets
who
throw
balls
at

one
on

these

the

now
through

with
a
great
noise
of

pass
all
the

of
the

hiding
their

in

losing
the

suspended
from

janus
master
of
the

flies
away
upon

of
his

while
the

is
benumbed
with

summanus
god
of
the

who
no

has
a

presses
against
his

an

in
the

of

they

me
formerly
they
used
to
be

and
he
points
out
to
antony
in
a
grove
of
a
woman
perfectly
naked
with
four
paws
like
a

bestridden
by
a

a

muttering
to
herself
the
lament
which
she
poured
forth
on
the
death
of
old
men
but
soon
her
voice
is
lost
amid
bitter
cries
which
come
from
the
domestic
lares
squatted
at
the
end
of
the
atrium
clad
in
dogs
skins
with
flowers
around
their
bodies
holding
their
closed
hands
up
to
their
cheeks
and
weeping
as
much
as
they
can
where
is
the
portion
of
food
which
is
given
to
us
at
each
meal
the
good
attentions
of
the
smile
of
the
matron
and
the
gaiety
of
the
little
boys
playing
with
on
the
mosaic
of
the
courtyard
then
when
they
have
grown
big
they
hang
over
our
breasts
their
gold
or
leather
bullæ
what
happiness
when
on
the
evening
of
a
triumph
the
master
returning
home
turned
towards
us
his
humid
eyes
he
told
the
story
of
his
contests
and
the
narrow
house
was
more
stately
than
a
palace
and
more
sacred
than
a
temple
how
pleasant
were
the
repasts
of
the
family
especially
the
day
after
the
feralia
the
feeling
of
tenderness
towards
the
dead
dispelled
all
discords
and
people
embraced
one
another
drinking
to
the
glories
of
the
past
and
to
the
hopes
of
the
future
but
the
ancestors
in
painted
wax
shut
up
behind
us
became
gradually
covered
with
mouldiness
the
new
races
to
punish
us
for
their
own
deceptions
have
broken
our
jaws
and
under
the
rats
teeth
our
bodies
of
wood
have
crumbled
away
and
the
innumerable
gods
watching
at
the
doors
in
the
kitchen
in
the
cellar
and
in
the
stoves
disperse
on
all
sides
under
the
appearance
of
enormous
ants
running
away
or
huge
butterflies
on
the
wing
then
a
thunderclap
i
was
the
god
of
armies
the
lord
the
lord
god
i
have
unfolded
on
the
hills
the
tents
of
jacob
and
nourished
in
the
sands
my
fugitive
people
it
was
i
who
burned
sodom
it
was
i
who
engulfed
the
earth
beneath
the
deluge
it
was
i
who
drowned
pharaoh
with
the
royal
princes
the
and
the
charioteers
a
jealous
god
i
execrated
the
other
gods
i
crushed
the
impure
i
overthrew
the
proud
and
my
desolation
rushed
to
right
and
left
like
a
dromedary
let
loose
in
a
field
of
maize
to
set
israel
free
i
chose
the
simple
angels
with
wings
of
flame
spoke
to
them
in
the
bushes
perfumed
with
spikenard
cinnamon
and
myrrh
with
transparent
robes
and
shoes
women
of
intrepid
heart
went
forth
to
slay
the
captains
the
passing
wind
bore
away
the
prophets
i
engraved
my
law
on
tablets
of
stone
it
shut
in
my
people
as
in
a
citadel
they
were
my
people
i
was
their
god
the
earth
was
mine
and
men
were
mine
with
their
thoughts
their
works
the
implements
with
which
they
tilled
the
soil
and
their
posterity
my
ark
rested
in
a
triple
sanctuary
behind
purple
curtains
and
flaming
lamps
for
my
ministry
i
had
an
entire
tribe
who
swung
the
censers
and
the
in
a
robe
of
hyacinth
and
wearing
precious
stones
upon
his
breast
arranged
in
regular
order
woe
woe
the
holy
of
holies
is
flung
open
the
veil
is
rent
the
odours
of
the
holocaust
are
scattered
to
all
the
winds
the
jackals
whine
in
the
sepulchres
my
temple
is
destroyed
my
people
are
dispersed
they
have
strangled
the
priests
with
the
cords
of
their
vestments
the
women
are
captives
the
sacred
vessels
are
all
melted
down
the
voice
dying
away
i
was
the
god
of
armies
the
lord
the
lord
god
then
comes
an
appalling
silence
a
profound
darkness
they
are
all
gone
i
remain
says
some
one
and
face
to
face
with
him
stands
hilarion
but
transfigured
beautiful
as
an
archangel
luminous
as
a
sun
and
so
tall
that
in
order
to
see
him
antony
lifts
up
his
head
who
then
are
you
my
kingdom
is
as
wide
as
the
universe
and
my
desire
has
no
limits
i
am
always
going
about
enfranchising
the
mind
and
weighing
the
worlds
without
hate
without
fear
without
love
and
without
god
i
am
called
science
recoiling
backwards
you
must
be
rather
the
devil
fixing
his
eyes
upon
him
do
you
wish
to
see
him
antony
no
longer
avoids
his
glance
he
is
seized
with
curiosity
concerning
the
devil
his
terror
increases
his
longing
becomes
measureless
if
i
saw
him
however
if
i
saw
him
then
in
a
spasm
of
rage
the
horror
that
i
have
of
him
will
rid
me
of
him
forever
yes
a
cloven
foot
reveals
itself
antony
is
filled
with
regret
but
the
devil
overshadows
him
with
his
horns
and
carries
him
off
chapter
vi
the
mystery
of
space
he
flies
under
antony
body
extended
like
a
swimmer
his
two
great
wings
outspread
entirely
concealing
him
resemble
a
cloud
where
am
i
going
just
now
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
form
of
the
accursèd
one
no
a
cloud
is
carrying
me
away
perhaps
i
am
dead
and
am
mounting
up
to
god
ah
how
well
i
breathe
the
untainted
air
inflates
my
soul
no
more
heaviness
no
more
suffering
beneath
me
the
thunderbolt
darts
forth
the
horizon
widens
rivers
cross
one
another
that
light
spot
is
the
desert
that
pool
of
water
the
ocean
and
other
oceans
appear
immense
regions
of
which
i
had
no
knowledge
there
are
black
lands
that
smoke
like
live
embers
a
belt
of
snow
ever
obscured
by
the
mists
i
am
trying
to
discover
the
mountains
where
each
evening
the
sun
goes
to
sleep
the
sun
never
goes
to
sleep
antony
is
not
startled
by
this
voice
it
appears
to
him
an
echo
of
his
thought
a
response
of
his
memory
meanwhile
the
earth
takes
the
form
of
a
ball
and
he
perceives
it
in
the
midst
of
the
azure
turning
on
its
poles
while
it
winds
around
the
sun
so
then
it
is
not
the
centre
of
the
world
pride
of
man
humble
thyself
i
can
scarcely
distinguish
it
now
it
is
intermingled
with
the
other
fires
the
firmament
is
but
a
tissue
of
stars
they
continue
to
ascend
no
noise
not
even
the
crying
of
the
eagles
nothing
and
i
bend
down
to
listen
to
the
music
of
the
spheres
you
can
not
hear
them
no
longer
will
you
see
the
antichthon
of
plato
the
focus
of
philolaüs
the
spheres
of
aristotle
or
the
seven
heavens
of
the
jews
with
the
great
waters
above
the
vault
of
crystal
from
below
it
appeared
as
solid
as
a
wall
but
now
on
the
contrary
i
am
penetrating
it
i
am
plunging
into
it
and
he
arrives
in
front
of
the
moon
which
is
like
a
piece
of
ice
quite
round
filled
with
a
motionless
light
this
was
formerly
the
abode
of
souls
the
good
pythagoras
had
even
supplied
it
with
birds
and
magnificent
flowers
i
see
nothing
there
save
desolate
plains
with
extinct
craters
under
a
black
sky
come
towards
those
stars
with
a
softer
radiance
so
that
we
may
gaze
upon
the
angels
who
hold
them
with
the
ends
of
their
arms
like
torches
the
devil
carries
him
into
the
midst
of
the
stars
they
attract
one
another
at
the
same
time
that
they
repel
one
another
the
action
of
each
has
an
effect
on
the
others
and
helps
to
produce
their
movements
and
all
this
without
the
medium
of
an
auxiliary
by
the
force
of
a
law
by
the
virtue
simply
of
order
yes
yes
my
intelligence
grasps
it
it
is
a
joy
greater
than
the
sweetness
of
affection
i
pant
with
stupefaction
before
the
immensity
of
god
like
the
firmament
which
rises
in
proportion
as
you
ascend
he
will
become
greater
according
as
your
imagination
mounts
higher
and
you
will
feel
your
joy
increase
in
proportion
to
the
unfolding
of
the
universe
in
this
enlargement
of
the
infinite
ah
higher
ever
higher
the
stars
multiply
and
shed
around
their
scintillations
the
milky
way
at
the
zenith
spreads
out
like
an
immense
belt
with
gaps
here
and
there
in
these
clefts
amid
its
brightness
dark
tracts
reveal
themselves
there
are
showers
of
stars
trains
of
golden
dust
luminous
vapours
which
float
and
then
dissolve
sometimes
a
comet
sweeps
by
suddenly
then
the
tranquillity
of
the
countless
lights
is
renewed
antony
with
open
arms
leans
on
the
devil
two
horns
thus
occupying
the
entire
space
covered
by
his
wings
he
recalls
with
disdain
the
ignorance
of
former
days
the
limitation
of
his
ideas
here
then
close
beside
him
were
those
luminous
globes
which
he
used
to
gaze
at
from
below
he
traces
the
crossing
of
their
paths
the
complexity
of
their
directions
he
sees
them
coming
from
afar
and
suspended
like
stones
in
a
sling
describing
their
orbits
and
pushing
forward
their
parabolas
he
perceives
with
a
single
glance
the
southern
cross
and
the
great
bear
the
lynx
and
the
centaur
the
nebulæ
of
the
the
six
suns
in
the
constellation
of
orion
jupiter
with
his
four
satellites
and
the
triple
ring
of
the
monstrous
saturn
all
the
planets
all
the
stars
which
men
should
in
future
days
discover
he
fills
his
eyes
with
their
light
he
overloads
his
mind
with
a
calculation
of
their
distances
then
he
lets
his
head
fall
once
more
what
is
the
object
of
all
this
there
is
no
object
how
could
god
have
had
an
object
what
experience
could
have
enlightened
him
what
reflection
enabled
him
to
judge
before
the
beginning
of
things
it
would
not
have
operated
and
now
it
would
be
useless
nevertheless
he
created
the
world
at
one
period
of
time
by
his
mere
word
but
the
beings
who
inhabit
the
earth
came
there
successively
in
the
same
way
in
the
sky
new
stars
arise
different
effects
from
various
causes
the
variety
of
causes
is
the
will
of
god
but
to
admit
in
god
several
acts
of
will
is
to
admit
several
causes
and
thus
to
destroy
his
unity
his
will
is
not
separable
from
his
essence
he
can
not
have
a
second
will
inasmuch
as
he
can
not
have
a
second
essence
and
since
he
exists
eternally
he
acts
eternally
look
at
the
sun
from
its
borders
escape
great
flames
emitting
sparks
which
scatter
themselves
to
become
new
worlds
and
further
than
the
last
beyond
those
depths
where
only
night
is
visible
other
suns
whirl
round
and
behind
these
others
again
and
others
still
to
infinity
enough
enough
i
am
terrified
i
am
about
to
fall
into
the
abyss
stops
and
gently
balancing
himself
there
is
no
such
thing
as
nothingness
there
is
no
vacuum
everywhere
there
are
bodies
moving
over
the
unchangeable
realms
of
space
and
as
if
it
had
any
bounds
it
would
not
be
space
but
a
body
it
consequently
has
no
limits
no
limits
ascend
into
the
sky
forever
and
ever
and
you
will
never
reach
the
top
descend
beneath
the
earth
for
millions
upon
millions
of
centuries
and
you
will
never
get
to
the
bottom
inasmuch
as
there
is
no
bottom
no
top
no
end
above
or
below
and
space
is
in
fact
comprised
in
god
who
is
not
a
part
of
space
of
a
magnitude
that
can
be
measured
but
immensity
slowly
matter
in
that
case
would
be
part
of
god
why
not
can
you
tell
where
he
comes
to
an
end
on
the
contrary
i
prostrate
myself
i
efface
myself
before
his
power
and
you
pretend
to
move
him
you
speak
to
him
you
even
adorn
him
with
virtues
goodness
justice
clemency
in
place
of
recognising
the
fact
that
he
possesses
all
perfections
to
conceive
anything
beyond
is
to
conceive
god
outside
of
god
being
outside
of
being
but
then
he
is
the
only
being
the
only
substance
if
substance
could
be
divided
it
would
lose
its
nature
it
would
not
be
itself
god
would
no
longer
exist
he
is
therefore
indivisible
as
well
as
infinite
and
if
he
had
a
body
he
would
be
made
up
of
parts
he
would
no
longer
be
one
he
would
no
longer
be
infinite
therefore
he
is
not
a
person
what
my
prayers
my
sobs
the
sufferings
of
my
flesh
the
transports
of
my
zeal
all
these
things
would
be
no
better
than
a
lie
in
space
uselessly
like
a
bird
cry
like
a
whirlwind
of
dead
leaves
he
weeps
oh
no
there
is
above
everything
some
one
a
great
spirit
a
lord
a
father
whom
my
heart
adores
and
who
must
love
me
you
desire
that
god
should
not
be
god
for
if
he
experienced
love
anger
or
pity
he
would
pass
from
his
perfection
to
a
greater
or
less
perfection
he
can
not
descend
to
a
sentiment
or
be
contained
under
a
form
one
day
however
i
shall
see
him
with
the
blessèd
is
it
not
when
the
finite
shall
enjoy
the
infinite
enclosing
the
absolute
in
a
limited
space
no
matter
there
must
be
a
paradise
for
the
good
as
well
as
a
hell
for
the
wicked
does
the
exigency
of
your
reason
constitute
the
law
of
things
without
doubt
evil
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
god
seeing
that
the
earth
is
covered
with
it
is
it
from
impotence
that
he
endures
it
or
from
cruelty
that
he
preserves
it
do
you
think
that
he
can
be
continually
putting
the
world
in
order
like
an
imperfect
work
and
that
he
watches
over
all
the
movements
of
all
beings
from
the
flight
of
the
butterfly
to
the
thought
of
man
if
he
created
the
universe
his
providence
is
superfluous
if
providence
exists
creation
is
defective
but
good
and
evil
only
concern
you
like
day
and
night
pleasure
and
pain
death
and
birth
which
have
relationship
merely
to
a
corner
of
space
to
a
special
medium
to
a
particular
interest
inasmuch
as
what
is
infinite
alone
is
permanent
the
infinite
exists
and
that
is
all
the
devil
has
gradually
extended
his
huge
wings
and
now
they
cover
space
antony
can
no
longer
see
he
is
on
the
point
of
fainting
a
horrible
chill
freezes
me
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
this
exceeds
the
utmost
pitch
of
pain
it
is
as
it
were
a
death
more
profound
than
death
i
wheel
through
the
immensity
of
darkness
it
enters
into
me
my
consciousness
is
shivered
to
atoms
under
this
expansion
of
nothingness
but
things
happen
only
through
the
medium
of
your
mind
like
a
concave
mirror
it
distorts
objects
and
you
need
every
resource
in
order
to
verify
facts
never
shall
you
understand
the
universe
in
its
full
extent
consequently
you
can
not
form
an
idea
as
to
its
cause
so
as
to
have
a
just
notion
of
god
or
even
say
that
the
universe
is
infinite
for
you
should
first
comprehend
the
infinite
form
is
perhaps
an
error
of
your
senses
substance
an
illusion
of
your
intellect
unless
it
be
that
the
world
being
a
perpetual
flux
of
things
appearances
by
a
sort
of
contradiction
would
not
be
a
test
of
truth
and
illusion
would
be
the
only
reality
but
are
you
sure
that
you
see
are
you
sure
that
you
live
perhaps
nothing
at
all
exists
the
devil
has
seized
antony
and
holding
him
by
the
extremities
of
his
arms
stares
at
him
with
open
jaws
ready
to
swallow
him
up
come
adore
me
and
curse
the
phantom
that
you
call
god
antony
raises
his
eyes
with
a
last
movement
of
lingering
hope
the
devil
quits
him
chapter
vii
the
chimera
and
the
sphinx
antony
finds
himself
stretched
on
his
back
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
the
sky
is
beginning
to
grow
white
is
this
the
brightness
of
dawn
or
is
it
the
reflection
of
the
moon
he
tries
to
rise
then
sinks
back
and
with
chattering
teeth
i
feel
fatigued
as
if
all
my
bones
were
broken
why
ah
it
is
the
devil
i
remember
and
he
even
repeated
to
me
all
i
had
learned
from
old
didymus
concerning
the
opinions
of
xenophanes
of
heraclitus
of
melissus
and
of
anaxagoras
as
well
as
concerning
the
infinite
the
creation
and
the
impossibility
of
knowing
anything
and
i
imagined
that
i
could
unite
myself
to
god
laughing
bitterly
ah
madness
madness
is
it
my
fault
prayer
is
intolerable
to
me
my
heart
is
drier
than
a
rock
formerly
it
overflowed
with
love
the
sand
in
the
morning
used
to
send
forth
exhalations
on
the
horizon
like
the
fumes
of
a
censer
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
blossoms
of
fire
burst
forth
from
the
cross
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
often
seemed
to
me
that
all
creatures
and
all
things
gathered
in
the
same
silence
were
with
me
adoring
the
lord
oh
charm
of
prayer
bliss
of
ecstasy
gifts
of
heaven
what
has
become
of
you
i
remember
a
journey
i
made
with
ammon
in
search
of
a
solitude
in
which
we
might
establish
monasteries
it
was
the
last
evening
and
we
quickened
our
steps
murmuring
hymns
side
by
side
without
uttering
a
word
in
proportion
as
the
sun
went
down
the
shadows
of
our
bodies
lengthened
like
two
obelisks
always
enlarging
and
marching
on
in
front
of
us
with
the
pieces
of
our
staffs
we
planted
the
cross
here
and
there
to
mark
the
site
of
a
cell
the
night
came
on
slowly
and
black
waves
spread
over
the
earth
while
an
immense
sheet
of
red
still
occupied
the
sky
when
i
was
a
child
i
used
to
amuse
myself
in
constructing
hermitages
with
pebbles
my
mother
close
beside
me
used
to
watch
what
i
was
doing
she
was
going
to
curse
me
for
abandoning
her
tearing
her
white
locks
and
her
corpse
remained
stretched
in
the
middle
of
the
cell
beneath
the
roof
of
reeds
between
the
tottering
walls
through
a
hole
a
hyena
sniffing
thrusts
forward
his
jaws
horror
horror
he
sobs
no
ammonaria
would
not
have
left
her
where
is
ammonaria
now
perhaps
in
a
hot
bath
she
is
drawing
off
her
garments
one
by
one
first
her
cloak
then
her
girdle
then
her
outer
tunic
then
her
inner
one
then
the
wrappings
round
her
neck
and
the
vapour
of
cinnamon
envelops
her
naked
limbs
at
last
she
sinks
to
sleep
on
the
tepid
floor
her
hair
falling
around
her
hips
looks
like
a
black
fleece
and
almost
suffocating
in
the
overheated
atmosphere
she
draws
breath
with
her
body
bent
forward
and
her
breasts
projecting
hold
here
is
my
flesh
breaking
into
revolt
in
the
midst
of
anguish
i
am
tortured
by
voluptuousness
two
punishments
at
the
same
time
it
is
too
much
i
can
no
longer
endure
my
own
body
he
stoops
down
and
gazes
over
the
precipice
the
man
who
falls
over
that
will
be
killed
nothing
easier
by
simply
rolling
over
on
the
left
side
it
is
necessary
to
take
only
one
step
only
one
then
appears
an
old
woman
antony
rises
with
a
start
of
error
he
imagines
that
he
sees
his
mother
risen
from
the
dead
but
this
one
is
much
older
and
excessively
emaciated
a
fastened
round
her
head
hangs
with
her
white
hair
down
to
the
very
extremities
of
her
legs
thin
as
sticks
the
brilliancy
of
her
teeth
which
are
like
ivory
makes
her
clayey
skin
look
darker
the
sockets
of
her
eyes
are
full
of
gloom
and
in
their
depths
flicker
two
flames
like
lamps
in
a
sepulchre
come
forward
she
says
what
keeps
you
back
stammering
i
am
afraid
of
committing
a
sin
she
resumes
but
king
saul
was
slain
razias
a
just
man
was
slain
saint
pelagius
of
antioch
was
slain
dominius
of
aleppo
and
his
two
daughters
three
more
saints
were
slain
and
recall
to
your
mind
all
the
confessors
who
in
their
eagerness
to
die
rushed
to
meet
their
executioners
in
order
to
taste
death
the
more
speedily
the
virgins
of
miletus
strangled
themselves
with
their
cords
the
philosopher
hegesias
at
syracuse
preached
so
well
on
the
subject
that
people
deserted
the
brothels
to
hang
themselves
in
the
fields
the
roman
patricians
sought
for
death
as
if
it
were
a
debauch
yes
it
is
a
powerful
passion
many
an
anchorite
has
yielded
to
it
old
to
do
a
thing
which
makes
you
equal
to
god
think
of
that
he
created
you
you
are
about
to
destroy
his
work
you
by
your
courage
freely
the
enjoyment
of
erostrates
was
not
greater
and
then
your
body
is
thus
mocked
by
your
soul
in
order
that
you
may
avenge
yourself
in
the
end
you
will
have
no
pain
it
will
soon
be
over
what
are
you
afraid
of
a
large
black
hole
it
is
empty
perhaps
antony
listens
without
saying
anything
in
reply
and
on
the
other
side
appears
another
woman
marvellously
young
and
beautiful
at
first
he
takes
her
for
ammonaria
but
she
is
taller
fair
as
honey
rather
plump
with
paint
on
her
cheeks
and
roses
on
her
head
her
long
robe
covered
with
spangles
is
studded
with
metallic
mirrors
her
fleshly
lips
have
a
look
of
blood
and
her
somewhat
heavy
eyelashes
are
so
much
bathed
in
languor
that
one
would
imagine
she
was
blind
she
murmurs
come
then
and
enjoy
yourself
solomon
recommends
pleasure
go
where
your
heart
leads
you
and
according
to
the
desire
of
your
eyes
to
find
what
pleasure
my
heart
is
sick
my
eyes
are
dim
she
replies
hasten
to
the
suburb
of
racotis
push
open
a
door
painted
blue
and
when
you
are
in
the
atrium
where
a
jet
of
water
is
gurgling
a
woman
will
present
herself
in
a
peplum
of
white
silk
edged
with
gold
her
hair
dishevelled
and
her
laugh
like
sounds
made
by
rattlesnakes
she
is
clever
in
her
caress
you
will
taste
the
pride
of
an
initiation
and
the
satisfaction
of
a
want
have
you
pressed
against
your
bosom
a
maiden
who
loved
you
recall
to
your
mind
her
remorse
which
vanished
under
a
flood
of
sweet
tears
you
can
imagine
yourself
can
you
not
walking
through
the
woods
beneath
the
light
of
the
moon
at
the
pressure
of
your
hands
joined
with
hers
a
shudder
runs
through
both
of
you
your
eyes
brought
close
together
overflow
from
one
to
the
other
like
immaterial
waves
and
your
heart
is
full
it
is
bursting
it
is
a
delicious
whirlwind
an
overpowering
intoxication
old
you
need
not
experience
joys
to
feel
their
bitterness
you
need
only
see
them
from
afar
and
disgust
takes
possession
of
you
you
must
needs
be
wearied
with
the
monotony
of
the
same
actions
the
duration
of
the
days
the
ugliness
of
the
world
and
the
stupidity
of
the
sun
oh
yes
all
that
it
shines
upon
is
displeasing
to
me
young
hermit
hermit
you
shall
find
diamonds
among
the
pebbles
fountains
beneath
the
sand
a
delight
in
the
dangers
which
you
despise
and
there
are
even
places
on
the
earth
so
beautiful
that
you
are
filled
with
a
longing
to
embrace
them
old
every
evening
when
you
lie
down
to
sleep
on
the
earth
you
hope
that
it
may
soon
cover
you
young
nevertheless
you
believe
in
the
resurrection
of
the
flesh
which
is
the
transport
of
life
into
eternity
the
old
woman
while
speaking
has
been
growing
more
emaciated
and
above
her
skull
which
has
no
hair
upon
it
a
bat
has
been
making
circles
in
the
air
the
young
woman
has
become
plumper
her
robe
changes
colour
her
nostrils
swell
her
eyes
roll
softly
the
first
says
opening
her
arms
come
i
am
consolation
rest
oblivion
eternal
peace
and
the
second
offering
her
breast
i
am
the
soother
the
joy
the
life
the
happiness
inexhaustible
antony
turns
on
his
heel
to
fly
each
of
them
places
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
the
flies
open
and
reveals
the
skeleton
of
death
the
robe
bursts
open
and
presents
to
view
the
entire
body
of
lust
which
has
a
slender
figure
with
an
enormous
development
behind
and
great
undulating
masses
of
hair
disappearing
towards
the
end
antony
remains
motionless
between
the
pair
contemplating
them
says
to
him
this
moment
or
a
little
later
what
does
it
matter
you
belong
to
me
like
the
suns
the
nations
the
cities
the
kings
the
snow
on
the
mountains
and
the
grass
in
the
fields
i
fly
higher
than
the
i
run
more
quickly
than
the
gazelle
i
keep
pace
even
with
hope
i
have
conquered
god
do
not
resist
i
am
omnipotent
the
forests
echo
with
my
sighs
the
waves
are
stirred
by
my
agitations
virtue
courage
piety
are
dissolved
in
the
perfume
of
my
breath
i
accompany
man
at
every
step
he
takes
and
on
the
threshold
of
the
tomb
he
comes
back
to
me
i
will
reveal
to
you
what
you
tried
to
grasp
by
the
light
of
torches
on
the
features
of
the
dead
or
when
you
rambled
beyond
the
pyramids
in
those
vast
composed
of
human
remains
from
time
to
time
a
piece
of
skull
rolled
under
your
sandal
you
took
it
out
of
the
dust
you
made
it
slip
between
your
fingers
and
your
mind
becoming
absorbed
in
it
was
plunged
into
nothingness
mine
is
a
deeper
gulf
marble
slabs
have
inspired
impure
loves
people
rush
towards
meetings
that
terrify
them
and
rivet
the
very
chains
which
they
curse
whence
comes
the
witchery
of
courtesans
the
extravagance
of
dreams
the
immensity
of
my
sadness
my
irony
surpasses
that
of
all
other
things
there
are
convulsions
of
joy
at
the
funerals
of
kings
and
at
the
extermination
of
peoples
and
they
make
war
with
music
plumes
flags
golden
harnesses
and
a
display
of
ceremony
to
pay
me
the
greater
homage
my
anger
is
as
strong
as
yours
i
howl
i
bite
i
have
sweats
of
agony
and
appearances
it
is
i
who
make
you
serious
let
us
embrace
each
other
death
chuckles
lust
roars
they
seize
each
other
figures
and
sing
together
i
hasten
the
dissolution
of
matter
i
facilitate
the
scattering
of
germs
thou
destroyest
that
i
may
renew
thou
engenderest
that
i
may
destroy
active
my
power
fruitful
my
decay
and
their
voices
whose
echoes
rolling
forth
fill
the
horizon
become
so
powerful
that
antony
falls
backward
a
shock
from
time
to
time
causes
him
to
half
open
his
eyes
and
he
perceives
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
a
kind
of
monster
before
him
it
is
a
with
a
crown
of
roses
it
rises
above
the
torso
of
a
woman
white
as
beneath
a
starred
with
points
of
gold
makes
a
kind
of
train
and
the
entire
body
undulates
like
a
gigantic
worm
holding
itself
erect
the
vision
grows
fainter
and
then
fades
away
rises
again
this
time
once
more
it
was
the
devil
and
under
his
aspect
the
spirit
of
voluptuousness
and
the
spirit
of
destruction
neither
terrifies
me
i
thrust
happiness
aside
and
feel
that
i
am
eternal
thus
death
is
only
an
illusion
a
veil
masking
at
certain
points
the
continuity
of
life
but
substance
being
one
why
is
there
a
variety
of
forms
there
must
be
somewhere
primordial
figures
whose
bodies
are
only
images
if
one
could
see
one
would
know
the
bond
between
mind
and
matter
wherein
being
consists
there
are
those
figures
which
were
painted
at
babylon
on
the
wall
of
the
temple
of
belus
and
they
covered
a
mosaic
in
the
port
of
carthage
i
myself
have
sometimes
seen
in
the
sky
what
seemed
like
forms
of
spirits
those
who
traverse
the
desert
meet
animals
passing
all
conception
and
opposite
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
nile
lo
the
sphinx
appears
it
stretches
out
its
feet
shakes
the
fillets
on
its
forehead
and
lies
down
upon
its
belly
jumping
flying
spirting
fire
through
its
nostrils
and
striking
its
wings
with
its
dragon
tail
the
chimera
with
its
green
eyes
winds
round
and
barks
the
curls
of
its
head
thrown
back
on
one
side
intermingle
with
the
hair
on
its
haunches
and
on
the
other
side
they
hang
over
the
sand
and
move
to
and
fro
with
the
swaying
of
its
entire
body
the
sphinx
is
motionless
and
gazes
at
the
chimera
here
chimera
stop
no
never
do
not
run
so
quickly
do
not
fly
so
high
do
not
bark
so
loud
do
not
address
me
do
not
address
me
any
more
since
you
remain
forever
silent
cease
casting
your
flames
in
my
face
and
flinging
your
yells
in
my
ears
you
shall
not
melt
my
granite
you
will
not
get
hold
of
me
terrible
sphinx
you
are
too
foolish
to
live
with
me
you
are
too
clumsy
to
follow
me
and
where
are
you
going
that
you
run
so
quickly
i
gallop
into
the
corridors
of
the
labyrinth
i
hover
over
the
mountains
i
skim
along
the
waves
i
yelp
at
the
bottoms
of
precipices
i
hang
by
my
jaws
on
the
skirts
of
the
clouds
with
my
trailing
tail
i
scratch
the
coasts
and
the
hills
have
taken
their
curb
according
to
the
form
of
my
shoulders
but
as
for
you
i
find
you
perpetually
motionless
or
rather
with
the
end
of
your
claw
tracing
letters
on
the
sand
that
is
because
i
keep
my
secret
i
reflect
and
i
calculate
the
sea
returns
to
its
bed
the
blades
of
corn
balance
themselves
in
the
wind
the
caravans
pass
the
dust
flies
off
the
cities
crumble
but
my
glance
which
nothing
can
turn
aside
remains
concentrated
on
the
objects
which
cover
an
inaccessible
horizon
as
for
me
i
am
light
and
joyous
i
discover
in
men
dazzling
perspectives
with
paradises
in
the
clouds
and
distant
felicities
i
pour
into
their
souls
the
eternal
insanities
projects
of
happiness
plans
for
the
future
dreams
of
glory
and
oaths
of
love
as
well
as
virtuous
resolutions
i
drive
them
on
perilous
voyages
and
on
mighty
enterprises
i
have
carved
with
my
claws
the
marvels
of
architecture
it
is
i
that
hung
the
little
bells
on
the
tomb
of
porsenna
and
surrounded
with
a
wall
of
corinthian
brass
the
quays
of
the
atlantides
i
seek
fresh
perfumes
larger
flowers
pleasures
hitherto
unknown
if
anywhere
i
find
a
man
whose
soul
reposes
in
wisdom
i
fall
upon
him
and
strangle
him
all
those
whom
the
desire
of
god
torments
i
have
devoured
the
strongest
in
order
to
climb
to
my
royal
forehead
mount
upon
the
stripes
of
my
fillets
as
on
the
steps
of
a
staircase
weariness
takes
possession
of
them
and
they
fall
back
of
their
own
accord
antony
begins
to
tremble
he
is
not
before
his
cell
but
in
the
desert
having
at
either
side
of
him
those
two
monstrous
animals
whose
jaws
graze
his
shoulders
o
fantasy
bear
me
on
thy
wings
to
enliven
thy
sadness
o
unknown
one
i
am
in
love
with
thine
eyes
i
turn
round
thee
soliciting
allayment
of
that
which
devours
me
my
feet
can
not
raise
themselves
the
lichen
like
a
ringworm
has
grown
over
my
mouth
by
dint
of
thinking
i
have
no
longer
anything
to
say
you
lie
hypocritical
sphinx
how
is
it
that
you
are
always
addressing
me
and
abjuring
me
it
is
you
unmanageable
caprice
who
pass
and
whirl
about
is
that
my
fault
come
now
just
let
me
be
it
barks
you
move
away
you
avoid
me
the
sphinx
grumbles
let
us
make
the
attempt
you
crush
me
no
impossible
and
sinking
little
by
little
it
disappears
in
the
sand
while
the
chimera
crawling
with
its
tongue
out
departs
with
a
winding
movement
the
breath
issuing
from
its
mouth
has
produced
a
fog
in
this
fog
antony
traces
masses
of
clouds
and
imperfect
curves
finally
he
distinguishes
what
appear
to
be
human
bodies
and
first
advances
the
group
of
astomi
like
passing
across
the
sun
do
puff
too
strongly
the
drops
of
rain
bruise
us
the
false
sounds
excoriate
us
the
darkness
blinds
us
composed
of
breezes
and
of
perfumes
we
roll
we
float
a
little
more
than
dreams
not
entirely
beings
the
nisnas
have
but
one
eye
one
cheek
one
hand
one
leg
half
a
body
and
half
a
heart
and
they
say
in
a
very
loud
tone
we
live
quite
at
our
ease
in
our
halves
of
houses
with
our
halves
of
wives
and
our
halves
of
children
absolutely
bereft
of
heads
our
shoulders
are
the
largest
and
there
is
not
an
ox
a
rhinoceros
or
an
elephant
that
is
capable
of
carrying
what
we
carry
arrows
and
a
sort
of
vague
outline
are
imprinted
on
our
breasts
that
is
all
we
reduce
digestion
to
thought
we
subtilise
secretions
for
us
god
floats
peacefully
in
the
internal
chyle
we
proceed
straight
on
our
way
passing
through
every
mire
running
along
the
verge
of
every
abyss
and
we
are
the
most
industrious
happy
and
virtuous
people
little
we
swarm
over
the
world
like
vermin
on
the
hump
of
a
dromedary
we
are
burnt
drowned
or
run
over
but
we
always
reappear
more
full
of
life
and
more
numerous
terrible
from
the
multitude
of
us
that
exists
kept
on
the
ground
by
our
flowing
locks
long
as
creeping
plants
we
vegetate
under
the
shelter
of
our
feet
which
are
as
large
as
parasols
and
the
light
reaches
us
through
the
spaces
between
our
wide
heels
no
disorder
and
no
toil
to
keep
the
head
as
low
as
possible
that
is
the
secret
of
happiness
their
lifted
thighs
resembling
trunks
of
trees
increase
in
number
and
now
a
forest
appears
in
which
huge
apes
rush
along
on
four
paws
they
are
men
with
dogs
heads
we
leap
from
branch
to
branch
to
suck
the
eggs
and
we
pluck
the
little
birds
then
we
put
their
nests
upon
our
heads
after
the
fashion
of
caps
we
do
not
fail
to
snatch
away
the
worst
of
the
cows
and
we
destroy
the
lynxes
eyes
tearing
the
flowers
crushing
the
fruits
agitating
the
springs
we
are
the
masters
by
the
strength
of
our
arms
and
the
fierceness
of
our
hearts
be
bold
comrades
and
snap
your
jaws
blood
and
milk
flow
from
their
lips
the
rain
streams
over
their
hairy
backs
antony
inhales
the
freshness
of
green
leaves
which
are
agitated
as
the
branches
of
the
trees
dash
against
each
other
all
at
once
appears
a
large
black
stag
with
a
bull
head
carrying
between
his
two
ears
a
mass
of
white
horns
my
antlers
are
hollow
like
flutes
when
i
turn
myself
towards
the
south
wind
sounds
go
forth
from
them
that
draw
around
me
the
ravished
beasts
the
serpents
come
winding
to
my
feet
the
wasps
stick
in
my
nostrils
and
the
parrots
the
doves
and
the
ibises
alight
upon
my
branches
listen
he
bends
back
his
horns
from
which
issues
an
unutterably
sweet
music
antony
presses
both
his
hands
above
his
heart
it
seems
to
him
as
if
this
melody
were
about
to
carry
off
his
soul
but
when
i
turn
towards
the
north
wind
my
horns
more
bushy
than
a
battalion
of
spears
emit
a
howling
noise
the
forests
thrill
the
rivers
swell
the
husks
of
the
fruit
burst
and
blades
of
grass
stand
erect
like
a
coward
hair
listen
he
bows
down
his
branches
from
which
now
come
forth
discordant
cries
antony
feels
as
if
he
were
torn
asunder
and
his
horror
is
increased
on
seeing
the
mantichor
a
gigantic
red
lion
with
a
human
figure
and
three
rows
of
teeth
the
silky
texture
of
my
scarlet
hair
mingles
with
the
yellowness
of
the
sands
i
breathe
through
my
nostrils
the
terror
of
solitudes
i
spit
forth
the
plague
i
devour
armies
when
they
venture
into
the
desert
my
nails
are
twisted
like
gimlets
my
teeth
are
cut
like
a
saw
and
my
hair
wriggled
out
of
shape
bristles
with
darts
which
i
scatter
right
and
left
behind
me
hold
hold
the
mantichor
casts
thorns
from
his
tail
which
radiate
like
arrows
in
all
directions
drops
of
blood
flow
spattering
over
the
foliage
the
catoblepas
appears
a
black
buffalo
with
a
pig
head
hanging
to
the
earth
and
connected
with
his
shoulders
by
a
slender
neck
long
and
flabby
as
an
empty
gut
he
is
wallowing
on
the
ground
and
his
feet
disappear
under
the
enormous
mane
of
hard
hairs
that
descend
over
his
face
fat
melancholy
savage
i
remain
continually
feeling
the
mire
under
my
stomach
my
skull
is
so
heavy
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
carry
it
i
roll
it
around
slowly
and
opening
my
jaws
i
snatch
with
my
tongue
the
poisonous
herbs
that
are
moistened
with
my
breath
i
once
devoured
my
paws
without
noticing
it
no
one
antony
has
ever
seen
my
eyes
or
those
who
have
seen
them
are
dead
if
i
but
raised
my
eyelids
my
eyelids
red
and
swollen
that
instant
you
would
die
oh
that
thing
well
well
as
if
i
had
any
such
longing
its
stupidity
attracts
me
no
no
i
will
not
he
looks
fixedly
on
the
ground
but
the
grass
lights
up
and
in
the
twistings
of
the
flames
stands
erect
the
basilisk
a
huge
violet
serpent
with
a
trilobate
crest
and
two
teeth
one
above
the
other
below
take
care
you
are
about
to
fall
into
my
jaws
i
drink
fire
i
am
fire
myself
and
from
every
quarter
i
suck
it
in
from
clouds
from
pebbles
from
dead
trees
from
the
hair
of
animals
and
from
the
surface
of
marshes
my
temperature
supports
the
volcanoes
i
cause
the
lustre
of
precious
stones
and
the
colour
of
metals
a
lion
with
a
vulture
beak
white
wings
red
paws
and
blue
neck
i
am
the
master
of
the
profound
splendours
i
know
the
secret
of
the
tombs
where
the
old
kings
sleep
a
chain
which
issues
from
the
wall
keeps
their
heads
erect
near
them
in
basins
of
porphyry
women
whom
they
have
loved
float
upon
black
liquids
their
treasures
are
ranged
in
halls
in
lozenges
in
hillocks
and
in
pyramids
and
lower
far
below
the
tombs
after
long
journeys
in
the
midst
of
suffocating
darkness
are
rivers
of
gold
with
forests
of
diamonds
meadows
of
carbuncles
and
lakes
of
quicksilver
with
my
back
against
the
door
of
the
vault
and
my
claws
in
the
air
i
watch
with
my
flaming
eyes
those
who
may
think
fit
to
come
there
the
immense
plain
even
to
the
furthest
point
of
the
horizon
is
quite
bare
and
whitened
with
travellers
bones
for
you
the
bronze
doors

open
and
you
will
inhale
the
vapour
of
the
mines
you
will
descend

caverns
quick

he

the

with
his
claws
crowing
like
a
cock
a
thousand
voices

to
him
the
forest
trembles
and
all
sorts
of
horrible
beasts

the
tragelaphus
the
myrmecoleo
a
lion
in

an
ant
behind
whose

the
python
aksar
of
sixty
cubits
who
frightened
moses
the

weasel
pastinaca
which

by
its

the

those

the

stirring
about

with

swaying
motion
as

he

the

the
cold

him
flying

the

he
hears
the

utter
human

then
the

who
sob
like

like

a
briny
breath

strikes
his

a

at

distance
rise
waterspouts
lashed
up
by
the

and
at
the
extremity

the

like

flat
like

crawling
over

you

about

with
us
into
our
unfathomable
depths
never
penetrated
by

before
different

dwell
in
the

some
are
in
the

others
swim
openly
in
the
transparency

browse
like
oxen
over

round
like

the

the

which

as
their

the

antony

he

it

over
some

when
up
springs
a

insects
like
petals

garnish
a

the

make
a

next
the

from
the
stones
pebbles
bear
a
resemblance
to
brains
stalactites
to
udders
and
to
tapestries
adorned
with
figures
in
pieces
of
ice
he
can
trace
efflorescences
impressions
of
bushes
and
shells
so
that
one
can
not
tell
whether
they
are
the
impressions
of
those
objects
or
the
objects
themselves
diamonds
glisten
like
eyes
and
minerals
palpitate
and
he
is
no
longer
afraid
he
lies
down
flat
on
his
face
resting
on
his
two
elbows
and
holding
in
his
breath
he
gazes
around
insects
without
stomachs
keep
eating
ferns
begin
to
bloom
afresh
and
limbs
which
were
wanting
sprout
forth
again
finally
he
perceives
little
globular
bodies
as
large
as
pins
heads
and
garnished
all
round
with
eyelashes
a
vibration
agitates
them
in
ecstasy
o
bliss
bliss
i
have
seen
the
birth
of
life
i
have
seen
the
beginning
of
motion
the
blood
beats
so
strongly
in
my
veins
that
it
seems
about
to
burst
them
i
feel
a
longing
to
fly
to
swim
to
bark
to
bellow
to
howl
i
would
like
to
have
wings
a
a
rind
to
blow
out
smoke
to
wear
a
trunk
to
twist
my
body
to
spread
myself
everywhere
to
be
in
everything
to
emanate
with
odours
to
grow
like
plants
to
flow
like
water
to
vibrate
like
sound
to
shine
like
light
to
be
outlined
on
every
form
to
penetrate
every
atom
to
descend
to
the
very
depths
of
matter
to
be
matter
the
dawn
appears
at
last
and
like
the
uplifted
curtains
of
a
tabernacle
golden
clouds
wreathing
themselves
into
large
volutes
reveal
the
sky
in
the
very
middle
of
it
and
in
the
disc
of
the
sun
itself
shines
the
face
of
jesus
christ
antony
makes
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
resumes
his
prayers
