no
natalie
weep
no

quick
dry
your
tears
let
not
my
executioner
see
that
we
can
feel
pain
or
weep
for
sorrow
drying
her
tears
she
attempted
a
smile
but
it
was
an
unnatural
painful
smile
ivan
said
she
we
will
forget
forget
all
excepting
that
we
love
each
other
and
thus
only
can
i
become
cheerful
and
tell
me
ivan
have
i
not
always
been
in
good
spirits
have
not
these
long
eight
years
in
siberia
passed
away
like
a
pleasant
summer
day
have
not
our
hearts
remained
warm
and
has
not
our
love
continued
undisturbed
by
the
inclement
siberian
cold
you
may
therefore
well
see
that
i
have
the
courage
to
bear
all
that
can
be
borne
but
you
my
beloved
you
my
husband
to
see
you
die
without
being
able
to
save
you
without
being
permitted
to
die
with
you
is
a
cruel
and
unnatural
sacrifice
ivan
let
me
weep
let
your
murderer
see
that
i
yet
have
tears
oh
my
god
i
have
no
longer
any
pride
i
am
nothing
but
a
poor
woman
your
widow
i
weep
over
the
yet
living
corpse
of
my
husband
with
convulsive
sobs
the
trembling
young
wife
fell
upon
her
knees
and
with
frantic
grief
clung
to
her
husband
s
feet
count
ivan
dolgorucki
no
long
felt
the
ability
to
stand
aloof
from
her
sorrow
he
bent
down
to
his
wife
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
with
her
he
wept
for
his
youth
his
lost
life
the
vanishing
happiness
of
his
love
and
the
shame
of
his
fatherhood
i
should
joyfully
go
to
my
death
were
it
for
the
benefit
of
my
country
said
he
but
to
fall
a
sacrifice
to
a
cabal
to
the
jealousy
of
an
insidious
knavish
favorite
is
what
makes
the
fearful
ah
i
die
for
naught
i
die
that
munnich
ostermann
and
biron
may
remain
securely
in
power
it
is
horrible
thus
to
die
natalie
s
eyes
flashed
with
a
fanatic
glow
you
die
said
she
and
i
shall
live
will
live
to
see
how
god
will
avenge
you
upon
these
i
will
live
that
i
may
constantly
think
of
you
and
in
every
hour
of
the
day
address
to
god
my
prayers
for
vengeance
and
retribution
live
and
pray
for
our
fatherland
said
ivan
no
she
angrily
cried
rather
let
god
s
curse
rest
upon
this
russia
which
delivers
over
its
noblest
men
to
the
executioner
and
raises
its
ignoblest
women
to
the
throne
no
blessing
for
russia
which
is
cursed
in
all
generations
and
for
all
time
no
blessing
for
russia
whose
bloodthirsty
czarina
permits
the
slaughter
of
the
noble
ivan
and
his
brothers
ah
said
ivan
how
beautiful
you
are
now
how
flash
your
eyes
and
how
radiantly
glow
your
cheeks
would
that
my
executioner
were
now
come
that
he
might
see
in
you
the
heroine
natalie
and
not
the
woman
ah
your
prayer
is
granted
hear
you
not
the
rattling
of
the
bolts
the
roll
of
the
drum
they
are
coming
ivan
they
are
coming
farewell
natalie
farewell
forever
and
mutually
embracing
they
took
one
last
long
kiss
but
wept
not
hear
me
natalie
when
they
bind
me
upon
the
wheel
weep
not
be
resolute
my
wife
and
pray
that
their
torments
may
not
render
me
weak
and
that
no
cry
may
escape
my
lips
i
will
pray
in
half
an
hour
all
was
over
the
noble
and
virtuous
count
ivan
dolgorucki
had
been
broken
upon
the
wheel
and
three
of
his
brothers
beheaded
and
for
what
because
count
munnich
fearing
that
the
noble
and
respected
brothers
dolgorucki
might
dispossess
him
of
his
usurped
power
had
persuaded
the
czarina
anna
that
they
were
plotting
her
overthrow
for
the
purpose
of
raising
katharina
ivanovna
to
the
imperial
throne
no
proof
or
conviction
was
required
munnich
had
said
it
and
that
sufficed
the
dolgoruckis
were
annihilated
but
natalie
dolgorucki
still
lived
and
from
the
bloody
scene
of
her
husband
s
execution
she
repaired
to
kiew
there
would
she
live
in
the
cloister
of
the
penitents
preserving
the
memory
of
the
being
she
loved
and
imploring
the
vengeance
of
heaven
upon
his
murderers
it
was
in
the
twilight
of
a
clear
summer
night
when
natalie
reached
the
cloister
in
which
she
was
on
the
next
day
to
take
the
vows
and
exchange
her
ordinary
dress
for
the
robe
of
and
the
nun
s
veil
foaming
rushed
the
dnieper
within
its
steep
banks
hissing
broke
the
waves
upon
the
gigantic
boulders
and
in
the
air
was
heard
the
sound
as
of
howling
thunder
and
a
roaring
storm
i
will
take
my
leave
of
nature
and
of
the
world
murmured
natalie
motioning
her
attendants
to
remain
at
a
distance
and
with
firm
feet
climbing
the
steep
rocky
bank
of
the
rushing
dnieper
upon
their
knees
her
servants
prayed
below
glancing
up
to
the
rock
upon
which
they
saw
the
tall
form
of
their
mistress
in
the
moonlight
which
surrounded
it
with
a
halo
the
stars
laid
a
radiant
crown
upon
her
pure
brow
and
her
locks
floating
in
the
wind
resembled
wings
to
her
servants
she
seemed
an
angel
borne
upon
air
and
light
and
love
upward
to
her
heavenly
home
natalie
stood
there
tranquil
and
tearless
the
thoughtful
glances
of
her
large
eyes
swept
over
the
whole
surrounding
region
she
took
leave
of
the
world
of
the
trees
and
flowers
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
below
at
her
feet
lay
the
cloister
and
natalie
stretching
forth
her
arms
toward
it
exclaimed
that
is
my
grave
happy
blessed
ivan
thou
diedst
ere
being
coffined
but
i
shall
be
coffined
while
yet
alive
i
stand
here
by
thy
tomb
mine
ivan
they
have
bedded
thy
noble
form
in
the
cold
waves
of
the
dnieper
whose
rushing
and
roaring
was
thy
funeral
knell
mine
ivan
i
shall
dwell
by
thy
grave
and
in
the
deathlike
stillness
of
my
cell
shall
hear
the
tones
of
the
solemn
hymn
with
which
the
impetuous
stream
will
rock
thee
to
thine
eternal
rest
receive
then
ye
sacred
waves
of
the
dnieper
receive
thou
mine
ivan
in
thy
cold
grave
thy
wife
s
vow
of
fidelity
to
thee
again
will
i
espouse
thee
in
life
as
in
death
am
i
thine
and
drawing
from
her
finger
the
which
her
beloved
husband
had
once
placed
upon
it
she
threw
it
into
the
foaming
waves
bending
down
she
saw
the
ring
sinking
in
the
waters
and
murmured
i
greet
thee
ivan
i
greet
thee
take
my
ring
forever
am
i
thine
then
rising
proudly
up
and
stretching
forth
her
arms
toward
heaven
she
exclaimed
aloud
i
now
go
to
pray
that
god
may
send
thee
vengeance
woe
to
russia
woe
and
the
stream
with
its
boisterous
waves
howled
and
thundered
after
her
the
words
woe
to
russia
woe
count
munnich
the
empress
anna
was
dead
and
an
case
in
russian
imperial
history
she
had
even
died
a
natural
death
again
was
the
russian
imperial
throne
vacated
who
is
there
to
mount
it
whom
has
the
empress
named
as
her
successor
no
one
dared
to
speak
of
it
the
question
was
read
in
all
eyes
but
no
lips
ventured
to
open
for
the
utterance
of
an
answer
as
every
conjecture
every
expression
if
unfounded
and
unfulfilled
would
be
construed
into
the
crime
of
as
soon
as
another
than
the
one
thus
indicated
should
be
called
to
the
throne
who
will
obtain
that
throne
so
asked
each
man
in
his
heart
the
courtiers
and
great
men
of
the
realm
asked
it
with
shuddering
and
despair
for
to
whom
should
they
now
go
to
pay
their
homage
and
thus
recommend
themselves
to
favor
in
advance
should
they
go
to
biron
the
duke
of
courland
was
it
not
possible
that
the
dying
empress
had
chosen
him
her
favorite
her
darling
minion
as
her
successor
to
the
throne
of
all
the
russias
but
how
if
she
had
not
done
so
if
instead
she
had
chosen
her
niece
the
wife
of
prince
anton
ulrich
of
brunswick
as
her
successor
or
was
it
not
also
possible
that
she
had
declared
the
princess
elizabeth
the
daughter
of
czar
peter
the
great
as
empress
the
latter
indeed
had
the
greatest
the
most
incontestable
right
to
the
imperial
throne
of
russia
was
she
not
the
sole
lawful
heir
of
her
father
how
if
one
therefore
went
to
her
and
congratulated
her
as
empress
but
if
one
should
make
a
mistake
how
then
the
courtiers
as
before
said
shuddered
and
hesitated
and
in
order
to
avoid
making
a
mistake
did
nothing
at
all
they
remained
in
their
palaces
ostensibly
giving
themselves
up
to
deep
mourning
for
the
decease
of
the
beloved
czarina
whom
every
one
of
them
secretly
hated
so
long
as
she
was
yet
alive
there
were
but
a
few
who
were
not
in
uncertainty
respecting
the
immediate
future
and
conspicuous
among
that
few
was
count
munnich
while
all
hesitated
and
wavered
in
anxious
doubt
munnich
alone
was
calm
he
knew
what
was
coming
because
he
had
had
a
hand
in
shaping
the
event
oh
said
he
while
walking
his
room
with
folded
arms
we
have
at
length
attained
the
object
of
our
wishes
and
this
bright
emblem
for
which
i
have
so
long
striven
will
now
finally
become
mine
i
shall
be
the
ruler
of
this
land
and
in
the
unrestricted
exercise
of
royal
power
i
shall
behold
these
millions
of
venal
slaves
grovelling
at
my
feet
and
whimpering
for
a
glance
or
a
smile
ah
how
sweet
is
this
governing
power
but
he
then
continued
with
a
darkened
brow
what
is
the
good
of
being
the
ruler
if
i
can
not
bear
the
name
of
ruler
what
is
it
to
govern
if
another
is
to
be
publicly
recognized
as
regent
and
receive
homage
as
such
the
kernel
of
this
glory
will
be
mine
but
the
shell
i
also
languish
for
the
shell
but
no
this
is
not
the
time
for
such
thoughts
now
when
the
circumstances
demand
a
cheerful
mien
and
every
outward
indication
of
satisfaction
my
time
will
also
come
and
when
it
comes
the
shell
as
well
as
the
kernel
shall
be
mine
but
this
is
the
hour
for
waiting
upon
the
duke
of
courland
i
shall
be
the
first
to
wish
him
joy
and
shall
at
the
same
time
remind
him
that
he
has
given
me
his
ducal
word
that
he
will
grant
the
first
request
i
shall
make
to
him
as
regent
well
well
i
will
ask
now
that
i
may
hereafter
the
ordered
his
carriage
and
proceeded
to
the
palace
of
the
duke
of
courland
a
deathlike
stillness
prevailed
in
the
streets
through
which
he
rode
on
every
hand
were
to
be
seen
only
curtained
windows
and
closed
palaces
it
seemed
as
if
this
usually
so
brilliant
and
noisy
quarter
of
petersburg
had
suddenly
become
deserted
and
desolate
the
usual
equipages
with
their
gold
and
attendants
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
count
s
carriage
thundered
through
the
deserted
streets
but
wherever
he
passed
curious
faces
were
seen
peeping
from
the
curtained
windows
of
the
palaces
all
doors
were
hastily
opened
behind
him
and
he
was
followed
by
the
runners
of
the
counts
and
princes
charged
with
the
duty
of
espying
his
movements
count
munnich
saw
all
that
and
smiled
i
have
now
given
them
the
signal
said
he
and
this
servile
russian
nobility
will
rush
hither
like
fawning
hounds
to
bow
before
a
new
idol
and
pay
it
their
venal
the
carriage
now
stopped
before
the
palace
of
the
duke
of
courland
and
with
an
humble
and
reverential
mien
munnich
ascended
the
stairs
to
the
brilliant
apartments
of
biron
he
found
the
duke
alone
absorbed
in
thought
he
was
standing
at
the
window
looking
down
into
streets
which
were
henceforth
to
be
subjected
to
his
sway
your
highness
is
surveying
your
realm
said
munnich
with
a
smile
wait
but
a
little
and
you
will
soon
see
all
the
great
nobility
flocking
here
to
pay
you
homage
my
carriage
stops
before
your
door
and
these
hounds
now
know
which
way
to
turn
with
their
abject
ah
sadly
responded
biron
i
dread
the
coming
hour
i
have
a
heart
and
this
night
in
a
dream
i
saw
myself
in
a
miserable
hut
covered
with
beggarly
rags
shivering
with
cold
and
fainting
with
hunger
that
dream
indicated
prosperity
and
happiness
your
highness
laughingly
responded
munnich
for
dreams
are
always
interpreted
by
contraries
you
saw
yourself
as
a
beggar
because
you
were
to
become
our
ruler
because
a
purple
mantle
will
this
day
be
placed
upon
your
blood
also
is
purple
gloomily
remarked
the
duke
and
a
sharp
poniard
may
also
convert
a
beggar
s
blouse
into
a
purple
mantle
oh
my
friend
would
that
i
had
never
become
what
i
am
one
sleeps
ill
when
one
must
constantly
watch
his
happiness
lest
it
escape
him
and
think
of
it
my
fortunes
are
dependent
upon
the
eyes
of
a
child
a
nurseling
that
with
its
mother
s
milk
imbibes
hatred
to
me
and
whose
first
use
of
speech
will
be
perhaps
to
curse
me
then
it
must
be
your
task
to
teach
the
young
emperor
ivan
to
speak
exclaimed
munnich
in
that
case
he
will
learn
to
bless
i
shall
not
be
able
to
snatch
him
from
his
parents
said
biron
but
those
parents
certainly
hate
me
and
indeed
very
naturally
as
they
it
seems
were
next
to
me
designated
as
the
guardians
of
their
son
ivan
the
duchess
anna
leopoldowna
of
brunswick
is
bah
for
the
present
she
is
in
love
exclaimed
munnich
with
a
laugh
and
women
when
in
love
think
of
nothing
but
their
love
but
only
look
your
highness
did
i
not
prophesy
correctly
only
see
the
numerous
equipages
now
stopping
before
your
door
the
street
will
soon
be
too
narrow
to
contain
and
in
the
street
below
was
really
to
be
seen
the
rapid
arrival
of
a
great
number
of
the
most
splendid
equipages
from
which
alighted
beautiful
and
women
whose
male
companions
were
covered
with
orders
and
who
were
all
hastening
into
the
palace
there
was
a
pressing
and
pushing
which
produced
the
greatest
possible
confusion
every
one
wished
to
be
the
first
to
congratulate
the
new
ruler
and
to
assure
him
of
their
unbounded
devotion
the
duke
s
halls
were
soon
filled
with
russian
magnates
and
when
at
length
the
duke
himself
made
his
appearance
among
them
he
everywhere
saw
only
happy
beaming
faces
and
encountered
only
glances
of
love
and
admiration
the
warmest
wishes
of
all
these
hundreds
seemed
to
have
been
fulfilled
and
biron
was
precisely
the
man
whom
all
had
desired
for
their
emperor
and
standing
in
the
centre
of
these
halls
they
read
to
biron
the
testament
of
the
deceased
empress
anna
that
testament
designated
ivan
the
son
of
the
duchess
anna
leopoldowna
and
prince
ulrich
of
brunswick
as
emperor
and
him
duke
biron
of
courland
as
absolute
regent
of
the
empire
during
the
minority
of
the
emperor
who
had
now
just
reached
the
age
of
seven
months
the
joy
of
the
magnates
was
indescribable
they
sank
into
each
other
s
arms
with
tears
of
joy
at
this
moment
old
enemies
were
reconciled
women
who
had
long
nourished
a
mutual
hatred
now
tenderly
pressed
each
other
s
hands
tears
of
joy
were
trembling
in
eyes
which
had
never
before
been
known
to
weep
friendly
smiles
were
seen
on
lips
which
had
usually
been
curled
with
anger
and
every
one
extolled
with
ecstasy
the
happiness
of
russia
and
humbly
bowed
before
the
new
sun
now
rising
over
that
blessed
realm
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
they
all
took
the
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
new
ruler
and
then
hastened
to
the
palace
of
the
prince
of
brunswick
there
with
the
humblest
subjection
to
kiss
the
delicate
little
hand
of
the
ivan
munnich
was
again
alone
with
the
duke
who
forgetting
all
his
dreams
now
gave
himself
up
to
the
proud
feeling
of
his
greatness
and
power
let
them
all
go
said
he
these
magnates
to
kiss
the
hand
of
this
emperor
of
seven
months
and
wallow
in
the
dust
before
the
cradle
of
a
whimpering
nurseling
i
shall
nevertheless
be
the
real
emperor
and
both
sceptre
and
crown
will
remain
in
my
hands
but
in
your
greatness
and
splendor
you
will
not
forget
your
faithful
and
devoted
friends
said
munnich
your
highness
will
remember
that
it
was
i
who
chiefly
induced
the
empress
to
name
you
as
regent
during
the
minority
of
ivan
and
that
you
gave
me
your
word
of
honor
that
you
would
grant
me
the
first
request
i
should
make
to
i
know
i
know
said
biron
with
a
sly
smile
thoughtfully
pacing
the
room
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
but
suddenly
stopping
he
remained
standing
before
munnich
and
looking
him
sharply
in
the
eye
said
shall
i
for
once
interpret
your
thoughts
count
munnich
shall
i
for
once
tell
you
why
you
used
all
your
influence
to
decide
the
empress
anna
to
name
me
for
the
regency
ah
you
had
a
sharp
eye
a
sure
glance
and
consequently
discovered
that
anna
had
long
since
resolved
in
her
heart
to
name
me
for
the
regency
before
you
undertook
to
confirm
her
in
this
resolve
by
your
sage
counsels
but
you
said
to
yourself
this
good
empress
loves
the
duke
of
courland
hence
she
will
undoubtedly
desire
to
render
him
great
and
happy
in
spite
of
all
opposition
and
if
i
aid
in
this
by
my
advice
i
shall
bind
both
parties
to
myself
the
empress
by
appearing
to
be
devoted
to
her
favorite
and
the
favorite
by
aiding
him
in
the
accomplishment
of
his
ambitious
plans
i
shall
therefore
secure
my
own
position
both
for
the
present
and
future
confess
to
me
that
these
were
your
thoughts
and
the
regent
sir
duke
of
courland
has
a
great
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
hence
i
dare
not
contradict
him
said
munnich
with
a
constrained
laugh
your
highness
therefore
recognizes
the
service
that
i
from
whatever
motive
have
rendered
you
and
hence
you
will
not
refuse
to
grant
my
let
me
hear
it
said
the
duke
stretching
himself
out
on
a
divan
and
negligently
playing
with
a
portrait
of
the
empress
anna
splendidly
ornamented
with
brilliants
and
suspended
from
his
neck
by
a
heavy
gold
chain
name
me
generalissimo
of
all
the
troops
said
munnich
with
solemnity
of
all
the
troops
asked
biron
including
those
on
the
water
or
only
those
on
land
the
troops
on
the
water
as
well
as
those
on
ah
that
means
i
am
to
give
you
unlimited
power
and
thus
place
you
at
the
head
of
all
affairs
then
suddenly
rising
from
his
reclining
position
and
striding
directly
to
munnich
the
duke
threateningly
said
in
my
first
observation
i
forgot
to
interpret
a
few
of
your
thoughts
and
plans
i
will
now
tell
you
why
you
wished
for
my
appointment
as
regent
you
desired
it
for
the
advancement
of
your
own
ambitious
plans
you
knew
biron
as
an
effeminate
yielding
favorite
of
the
empress
you
saw
him
devoted
only
to
amusement
and
enjoyment
and
you
said
to
yourself
that
is
the
man
i
need
as
i
can
not
myself
be
made
regent
let
it
be
him
i
will
govern
through
him
and
while
this
voluptuous
devotee
of
pleasure
gives
himself
up
to
the
intoxication
of
enjoyments
i
will
rule
in
his
well
were
not
those
your
thoughts
munnich
had
turned
very
pale
while
the
duke
was
thus
speaking
and
a
sombre
inquietude
was
depicted
on
his
features
i
know
not
he
stammered
with
embarrassment
but
know
thundered
the
duke
and
in
your
face
i
read
the
confirmation
of
what
i
have
said
look
in
the
glass
sir
count
and
you
will
make
no
further
attempt
at
but
the
question
here
is
not
about
what
i
might
have
once
thought
but
of
what
you
promised
me
your
highness
i
have
made
my
first
request
it
is
for
you
to
grant
it
i
implore
your
on
the
strength
of
your
ducal
word
to
name
me
as
the
generalissimo
of
your
troops
no
never
exclaimed
the
duke
you
gave
me
your
word
i
gave
it
as
duke
of
courland
the
regent
is
not
bound
by
the
promise
of
the
i
made
you
regent
and
i
do
make
you
generalissimo
you
forfeit
your
word
of
honor
no
ask
something
else
and
i
will
grant
it
but
this
is
not
feasible
i
must
myself
be
the
generalissimo
of
my
own
troops
or
i
should
no
longer
be
the
ruler
ask
therefore
for
something
munnich
was
silent
his
features
indicated
a
frightful
commotion
and
his
bosom
heaved
violently
i
have
nothing
further
to
ask
said
he
after
a
pause
but
i
will
confer
upon
you
a
favor
without
your
asking
it
proudly
responded
the
duke
count
munnich
i
confirm
you
in
your
offices
and
dignities
and
to
prove
to
you
my
unlimited
confidence
you
shall
continue
to
be
what
you
were
under
the
empress
anna
in
the
russian
army
i
thank
you
sir
duke
calmly
replied
munnich
it
is
very
noble
in
you
that
you
do
not
send
me
into
banishment
for
my
presumptuous
clasping
the
offered
hand
of
the
duke
he
respectfully
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
now
go
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
young
emperor
that
you
may
not
be
accused
of
disrespect
smilingly
added
biron
one
must
always
preserve
munnich
silently
bowed
while
walking
backward
toward
the
door
we
part
as
friends
asked
the
duke
nodding
an
adieu
as
friends
for
life
and
death
said
munnich
with
a
smile
but
no
sooner
had
the
door
closed
behind
him
than
the
smile
vanished
from
his
features
and
was
replaced
by
an
expression
of
furious
rage
he
threateningly
shook
his
fist
toward
the
door
which
separated
him
from
the
duke
and
with
convulsively
compressed
lips
and
grating
teeth
he
said
yes
we
now
part
as
friends
but
we
shall
yet
meet
as
enemies
i
shall
remember
this
hour
sir
duke
and
shall
do
my
best
to
prevent
your
forgetting
it
ah
you
have
not
sent
me
to
siberia
but
i
will
send
you
there
and
now
to
the
emperor
ivan
i
shall
there
meet
his
parents
the
ulrich
of
brunswick
and
his
wife
anna
leopoldowna
i
think
they
will
welcome
with
a
firm
step
rage
and
vengeance
in
his
heart
but
outwardly
smiling
and
submissive
count
munnich
betook
himself
to
the
palace
of
the
duke
of
brunswick
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
cradled
emperor
ivan
count
ostermann
four
weeks
had
passed
since
biron
duke
of
courland
had
commenced
his
rule
over
russia
as
regent
in
the
name
of
the
infant
emperor
ivan
the
russian
people
had
with
indifference
submitted
to
this
new
ruler
and
manifested
the
same
subjection
to
him
as
to
his
predecessor
it
was
all
the
same
to
them
whoever
sat
in
godlike
splendor
upon
the
magnificent
imperial
throne
what
care
that
mass
of
degraded
slaves
who
are
crawling
in
the
dust
for
the
name
by
which
their
tyrants
are
called
they
remain
what
they
are
slaves
and
the
one
upon
the
throne
remains
what
he
is
their
absolute
lord
and
tyrant
who
has
the
right
to
scourge
them
with
whips
to
make
them
barons
and
counts
and
perhaps
the
next
day
to
send
them
to
siberia
or
subject
them
to
the
infliction
of
the
fatal
knout
whoever
proclaims
himself
emperor
or
dictator
is
greeted
by
the
russian
people
that
horde
of
creeping
slaves
as
their
lord
and
master
the
supreme
disposer
of
life
and
death
while
they
crawl
in
the
dust
at
his
feet
they
had
sworn
allegiance
to
the
regent
biron
as
they
had
to
the
empress
anna
they
threw
themselves
upon
the
earth
when
they
met
him
they
humbly
bared
their
heads
when
passing
his
palace
and
when
the
magnates
of
the
realm
the
princes
and
counts
of
russia
in
their
proud
equipages
discovered
the
regent
s
carriage
in
the
distance
they
ordered
a
halt
descended
from
their
vehicles
and
bowed
themselves
to
the
ground
before
their
passing
lord
in
russia
all
distinctions
of
rank
cease
in
the
presence
of
the
ruler
there
is
but
one
lord
and
one
trembling
slave
be
he
prince
or
beggar
and
that
lord
must
be
obeyed
whether
he
commands
a
murder
or
any
other
crime
the
word
and
will
of
the
emperor
purify
and
sanctify
every
act
blessing
it
and
making
it
honorable
biron
was
emperor
although
he
bore
only
the
name
of
regent
he
had
the
power
and
the
dominion
the
infant
nurseling
ivan
the
minor
emperor
was
but
a
shadow
a
phantom
having
the
appearance
but
not
the
reality
of
lordship
he
was
a
thing
unworthy
of
notice
he
could
make
no
one
tremble
with
fear
and
therefore
it
was
unnecessary
to
crawl
in
the
dust
before
him
homage
was
paid
to
the
regent
biron
duke
of
courland
the
palace
of
prince
ulrich
of
brunswick
and
his
son
the
emperor
ivan
stood
empty
and
desolate
no
one
regarded
it
and
yet
perhaps
it
was
worthy
of
regard
yet
many
repaired
to
this
quiet
silent
palace
to
know
whom
biron
would
perhaps
have
given
princedoms
and
millions
but
no
one
was
there
to
betray
them
to
the
regent
they
were
very
silent
and
very
cautious
in
the
palace
of
the
prince
of
brunswick
and
his
wife
the
princess
anna
leopoldowna
it
was
as
we
have
said
about
four
weeks
after
the
commencement
of
the
regency
of
the
duke
of
courland
when
a
was
set
down
before
a
small
back
door
of
the
duchess
anna
leopoldowna
s
palace
it
had
been
borne
and
accompanied
by
four
serfs
over
whose
liveries
as
if
to
protect
them
from
the
weather
had
been
laid
a
tolerably
thick
coat
of
dust
and
sweat
equally
splendid
elegant
and
unclean
was
the
chair
which
the
servants
now
opened
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
their
master
to
emerge
from
it
that
person
who
now
made
his
appearance
was
a
shrunken
trembling
coughing
old
gentleman
his
small
bent
distorted
form
was
wrapped
in
a
fur
cloak
which
somewhat
tattered
permitted
a
soiled
and
faded
to
make
itself
perceptible
giving
to
the
old
man
the
appearance
of
indigence
and
slovenliness
nothing
not
even
the
face
or
the
thin
and
meagre
hands
he
extended
to
his
servants
was
neat
and
cleanly
nothing
about
him
shone
but
his
eyes
those
gray
piercing
eyes
with
their
fiery
and
their
now
kind
and
now
sly
and
subtle
expression
this
ragged
and
untidy
old
man
might
have
been
taken
for
a
beggar
had
not
his
dirty
fingers
and
his
faded
whose
original
color
was
hardly
discoverable
flashed
with
brilliants
of
an
unusual
size
and
had
not
the
arms
emblazoned
upon
the
door
of
his
chair
in
spite
of
the
dust
and
dirt
betrayed
a
noble
rank
the
arms
were
those
of
the
ostermann
family
and
this
dirty
old
man
in
the
ragged
cloak
was
count
ostermann
the
famous
russian
statesman
the
son
of
a
german
preacher
who
had
managed
by
wisdom
cunning
and
intrigue
to
continue
in
place
under
five
successive
russian
emperors
or
regents
most
of
whom
had
usually
been
thrust
from
power
by
some
bloody
means
czar
peter
who
first
appointed
him
as
a
minister
of
state
and
confided
to
him
the
department
of
foreign
affairs
on
his
said
to
his
successor
the
first
catherine
that
ostermann
was
the
only
one
who
had
never
made
a
false
step
and
recommended
him
to
his
wife
as
a
prop
to
the
empire
catherine
appointed
him
imperial
chancellor
and
tutor
of
peter
ii
he
knew
how
to
secure
and
preserve
the
favor
of
both
and
the
successor
of
peter
the
empress
anna
was
glad
to
retain
the
services
of
the
celebrated
statesman
and
diplomatist
who
had
so
faithfully
served
her
predecessors
from
anna
he
came
to
her
favorite
baron
of
courland
who
did
not
venture
to
remove
one
whose
talents
had
gained
for
him
so
distinguished
a
reputation
and
who
in
any
case
might
prove
a
very
dangerous
enemy
but
with
count
ostermann
it
had
gone
as
with
count
munnich
neither
of
them
had
been
able
to
obtain
from
the
regent
any
thing
more
than
a
confirmation
of
their
offices
and
dignities
to
which
biron
jealous
of
power
had
been
unwilling
to
make
any
addition
deceived
in
their
expectations
vexed
at
this
frustration
of
their
plans
they
had
both
come
to
the
determination
to
overthrow
the
man
who
was
unwilling
to
advance
them
they
had
become
biron
s
enemies
because
he
did
not
show
himself
their
friend
and
openly
devoted
to
him
and
bowing
in
the
dust
before
him
they
had
secretly
repaired
to
his
bitterest
enemy
the
duchess
anna
leopoldowna
to
offer
her
their
services
against
the
haughty
regent
who
swayed
the
iron
sceptre
of
his
despotic
power
over
russia
a
decisive
conversation
was
this
day
to
be
held
with
the
duchess
and
her
husband
prince
ulrich
of
brunswick
and
therefore
an
case
had
even
count
ostermann
resolved
to
leave
his
dusty
room
for
some
hours
and
repair
to
the
palace
of
the
duchess
anna
leopoldowna
slowly
slowly
ye
knaves
groaned
ostermann
as
he
ascended
the
narrow
winding
stairs
with
the
aid
of
his
servants
see
you
not
you
hounds
that
every
one
of
your
movements
causes
me
insufferable
pain
ah
a
fearful
illness
is
evidently
coming
it
is
already
attacking
my
limbs
and
pierces
and
agonizes
every
part
of
my
system
let
my
bed
be
prepared
at
home
you
scamps
and
have
a
strengthening
soup
made
ready
for
me
and
now
away
fellows
and
woe
to
you
if
during
my
absence
either
one
of
you
should
dare
to
break
into
the
or
you
know
that
i
have
good
eyes
and
am
cognizant
of
every
article
on
hand
even
to
its
exact
weight
and
measure
take
care
therefore
take
care
for
if
but
an
ounce
of
meat
or
a
glass
of
wine
is
missing
i
will
have
you
whipped
you
hounds
until
the
blood
flows
that
you
may
depend
upon
and
dismissing
his
assistants
with
a
kick
count
ostermann
ascended
the
last
steps
of
the
winding
stairs
alone
and
unaided
but
before
opening
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
took
time
for
reflection
hem
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
to
have
been
already
taken
ill
for
if
this
plan
should
miscarry
and
the
regent
discover
that
i
was
in
the
palace
how
then
ah
i
already
seem
to
feel
a
draught
of
siberian
air
but
no
it
will
succeed
and
how
would
that
ambitious
munnich
triumph
should
it
succeed
without
me
no
for
this
time
i
must
be
present
to
the
vexation
of
munnich
that
he
may
not
put
all
russia
in
his
pocket
the
good
man
has
such
large
pockets
and
such
grasping
hands
nodding
and
smiling
to
himself
ostermann
opened
the
door
of
the
anteroom
a
rapid
searching
glance
satisfied
him
that
he
was
alone
there
but
his
brow
darkened
when
he
observed
count
munnich
s
mantle
lying
upon
a
chair
ah
he
has
preceded
me
peevishly
murmured
ostermann
well
well
we
can
afford
once
more
to
yield
the
precedence
to
him
he
i
my
turn
will
come
quite
forgetting
his
illness
and
his
pretended
pains
he
rapidly
crossed
the
spacious
room
and
throwing
his
ragged
fur
cloak
upon
munnich
s
mantle
said
a
poor
old
cloak
like
this
is
yet
in
condition
to
render
that
resplendent
uniform
invisible
not
a
spangle
of
that
magnificent
gold
embroidery
can
be
seen
it
is
all
overshadowed
by
the
ragged
old
cloak
which
munnich
so
much
despises
oh
the
good
will
rejoice
to
find
his
mantle
in
such
good
company
and
i
hope
my
cloak
may
leave
some
visible
memento
upon
its
embroidered
companion
well
the
is
a
brave
man
and
i
have
given
him
an
opportunity
to
make
a
campaign
against
his
own
mantle
the
fool
why
does
he
dislike
these
good
little
animals
and
would
yet
be
a
russian
as
however
he
opened
the
door
of
the
next
room
his
form
again
took
its
former
shrunken
frail
appearance
and
his
features
again
bore
the
expression
of
suffering
and
exhaustion
ah
it
is
you
said
prince
ulrich
advancing
to
meet
the
count
while
munnich
stood
near
a
in
earnest
conversation
with
anna
leopoldowna
to
whom
he
seemed
to
be
explaining
something
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
we
have
waited
long
for
you
my
dear
count
continued
the
prince
offering
his
hand
to
the
with
a
smile
the
old
and
the
sick
always
have
the
misfortune
to
arrive
too
late
said
count
ostermann
pain
and
suffering
are
such
hinderances
your
grace
and
moreover
i
have
only
come
in
obedience
to
the
wishes
of
your
highness
well
knowing
that
i
am
superfluous
here
what
has
the
feeble
old
man
to
do
in
the
councils
of
the
strong
to
represent
wisdom
in
council
said
the
prince
and
for
that
you
are
precisely
the
man
ah
count
ostermann
at
this
moment
interposed
munnich
it
is
well
you
have
come
you
will
be
best
able
to
tell
their
excellencies
whether
i
am
right
or
munnich
is
always
right
said
ostermann
with
a
pleasant
smile
i
unconditionally
say
yes
to
whatever
you
may
have
proposed
provided
that
it
is
not
a
proposition
of
which
my
judgment
can
not
that
is
a
very
conditional
yes
exclaimed
the
duchess
laughing
a
yes
all
perforated
with
little
back
doors
through
which
a
no
may
conveniently
enter
laughed
the
prince
the
back
doors
are
in
all
cases
of
the
greatest
importance
said
count
ostermann
earnestly
through
back
doors
one
often
attains
to
the
rooms
of
state
and
had
your
palace
here
accidentally
had
no
back
door
for
the
admission
of
us
your
devoted
servants
who
knows
your
highness
anna
whether
you
would
on
this
very
night
become
regent
on
this
night
suddenly
exclaimed
munnich
you
see
your
highness
that
count
ostermann
is
wholly
of
my
opinion
it
must
be
done
this
night
that
would
be
overhaste
cried
the
duchess
we
are
not
yet
prepared
nor
is
the
regent
biron
of
courland
thoughtfully
interposed
ostermann
and
therefore
our
overhaste
would
take
biron
by
decidedly
my
opinion
said
munnich
all
is
lost
if
we
give
the
regent
time
and
leisure
to
make
his
arrangements
if
we
do
not
annihilate
him
he
may
perhaps
send
us
to
siberia
the
duchess
turned
pale
a
trembling
ran
through
her
tall
noble
form
i
so
much
dread
the
shedding
of
blood
said
she
oh
i
am
not
at
all
vain
said
ostermann
i
find
it
much
less
unpleasant
to
see
the
blood
of
others
flowing
than
my
own
it
may
be
egotism
but
i
prefer
keeping
my
blood
in
my
veins
to
exposing
it
to
the
gaping
curiosity
of
an
astonished
crowd
you
think
then
that
he
already
suspects
and
would
murder
us
you
us
and
also
your
son
the
emperor
also
my
son
exclaimed
leopoldowna
her
eyes
flashing
like
those
of
an
enraged
lioness
ah
i
should
know
how
to
defend
my
son
let
biron
fall
this
night
so
be
it
unanimously
exclaimed
the
three
men
he
has
driven
us
to
this
extremity
said
the
princess
not
enough
that
he
has
banished
our
friends
and
faithful
servants
surrounding
us
with
his
miserable
creatures
and
spies
not
enough
that
he
wounds
and
humiliates
us
in
every
way
he
would
rend
the
young
emperor
from
us
his
parents
his
natural
protectors
we
are
attacked
in
our
holiest
rights
and
must
therefore
defend
but
what
shall
we
do
with
this
small
biron
when
he
is
no
longer
the
great
regent
asked
ostermann
we
will
make
him
by
a
head
smaller
said
munnich
laughing
no
vehemently
exclaimed
leopoldowna
no
no
blood
shall
flow
not
with
blood
shall
our
own
and
our
son
s
rights
be
secured
swear
this
gentlemen
or
i
will
never
give
my
consent
to
the
i
well
knew
that
your
highness
would
so
decide
said
munnich
with
a
smile
drawing
a
folded
paper
from
his
bosom
in
proof
of
which
i
hand
this
paper
to
your
ah
what
is
this
said
the
duchess
unfolding
the
paper
it
is
the
ground
plan
of
a
house
of
the
house
we
will
have
built
for
biron
in
siberia
said
munnich
i
have
drawn
the
plan
in
fact
you
are
a
skilful
architect
count
munnich
said
ostermann
laughing
while
casting
an
interrogating
glance
at
the
paper
which
anna
was
still
thoughtfully
examining
how
well
you
have
arranged
it
all
how
delightful
these
snug
little
chambers
will
be
there
will
be
just
space
enough
in
them
to
turn
around
in
but
these
small
chambers
seem
to
be
a
little
too
low
they
are
evidently
not
more
than
five
feet
high
as
biron
however
has
about
your
height
he
will
not
be
able
to
stand
upright
in
bah
for
that
very
reason
said
munnich
with
a
cruel
laugh
he
has
carried
his
head
high
long
enough
now
he
may
learn
to
but
that
will
be
a
continual
torment
exclaimed
the
duke
of
brunswick
on
has
he
not
tormented
us
angrily
responded
munnich
we
need
how
strange
and
horrible
said
anna
leopoldowna
shuddering
this
man
is
now
standing
here
clothed
with
unlimited
power
and
we
are
already
holding
in
our
hands
the
plan
of
his
prison
yes
yes
and
with
this
plan
in
his
pocket
will
count
munnich
now
go
to
dine
with
biron
and
enjoy
his
hospitality
laughingly
exclaimed
ostermann
ah
that
must
make
the
dinner
particularly
piquant
how
agreeable
it
must
be
to
press
the
regent
s
hand
and
at
the
same
time
feel
the
rustling
in
your
pocket
of
the
paper
upon
which
you
have
drawn
the
plan
of
his
siberian
prison
but
you
are
in
the
right
the
regent
has
deeply
offended
you
how
could
he
dare
refuse
to
make
you
his
generalissimo
ah
it
is
not
for
that
said
munnich
with
embarrassment
and
seeking
to
give
the
conversation
a
different
turn
he
continued
ah
see
count
ostermann
what
a
terrible
animal
is
crawling
there
upon
your
dress
policy
nothing
but
policy
tranquilly
responded
ostermann
while
the
princess
turned
away
with
an
expression
of
repugnance
well
cried
the
prince
laughing
explain
to
us
count
ostermann
what
those
disgusting
insects
have
to
do
with
policy
or
politics
we
are
all
four
germans
said
ostermann
and
consequently
are
all
familiar
with
the
common
saying
tell
me
the
company
you
keep
and
i
will
tell
you
what
you
are
i
have
always
kept
that
in
mind
since
i
have
been
in
russia
and
to
make
this
good
people
forget
that
i
am
a
foreigner
i
have
taken
particular
pains
to
furnish
myself
with
a
supply
of
their
dirt
and
of
these
delicate
insects
if
any
one
asks
me
who
i
am
i
show
him
these
creatures
with
whom
i
associate
and
he
immediately
concludes
that
i
am
a
ostermann
joined
in
the
laugh
that
followed
this
explanation
but
suddenly
he
uttered
a
piercing
cry
and
sank
down
upon
a
chair
ah
these
pains
will
be
the
death
of
me
he
moaned
ah
i
already
feel
the
ravages
of
death
in
my
blood
yes
i
have
long
known
that
a
dangerous
malady
was
hovering
over
me
and
my
is
already
prepared
at
home
i
am
a
poor
failing
old
man
and
who
knows
whether
i
shall
outlive
the
evening
of
this
day
while
ostermann
was
thus
lamenting
and
the
prince
with
kindly
sympathy
was
occupied
about
him
munnich
had
returned
the
drawing
to
his
pocket
and
was
speaking
in
a
low
tone
to
the
duchess
of
some
yet
necessary
preparations
for
the
night
count
ostermann
notwithstanding
his
lamentations
and
his
pretended
pains
had
yet
a
sharp
ear
for
every
word
they
spoke
he
very
distinctly
heard
the
duchess
say
well
i
am
satisfied
i
shall
expect
you
at
about
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
if
the
affair
is
successful
you
count
munnich
may
be
sure
of
my
most
fervent
gratitude
you
will
then
have
liberated
russia
the
young
emperor
and
myself
from
a
cruel
and
despotic
tyrant
and
i
shall
be
eternally
beholden
to
count
munnich
s
brow
beamed
with
inward
satisfaction
i
shall
then
attain
my
ends
thought
he
aloud
he
said
your
highness
i
have
but
one
wish
and
one
request
if
you
are
willing
to
fulfil
this
then
will
there
be
nothing
left
on
earth
for
me
to
then
name
your
request
at
once
that
i
may
grant
it
in
advance
said
the
princess
with
a
smile
the
man
is
getting
on
rapidly
and
will
even
now
get
the
appointment
of
generalissimo
thought
ostermann
that
must
never
be
i
must
prevent
it
and
just
as
munnich
was
opening
his
mouth
to
prefer
his
request
ostermann
suddenly
uttered
so
loud
and
piteous
a
cry
of
anguish
that
the
compassionate
and
alarmed
princess
hastened
to
offer
him
her
sympathy
and
aid
at
this
moment
the
clock
upon
the
wall
struck
four
that
was
the
hour
for
which
munnich
was
invited
to
dine
with
the
regent
it
would
not
do
to
fail
of
his
engagement
he
must
be
punctual
to
avoid
exciting
suspicion
he
therefore
had
no
longer
the
time
to
lay
his
request
before
the
princess
consequently
count
ostermann
had
accomplished
his
object
and
secretly
triumphing
he
loudly
groaned
and
complained
of
his
sufferings
count
munnich
took
his
leave
i
go
now
he
smilingly
said
to
take
my
last
dinner
with
the
duke
of
courland
i
shall
return
this
night
at
the
appointed
hour
we
shall
then
convert
the
duke
into
a
siberian
convict
which
at
all
events
will
be
a
very
interesting
thus
he
departed
with
a
horrible
laugh
upon
his
lips
to
keep
his
appointment
with
the
regent
count
ostermann
had
again
attained
his
end
he
remained
alone
with
the
princely
pair
had
munnich
been
the
first
who
came
ostermann
was
the
last
to
go
ah
said
he
rising
with
apparent
difficulty
i
will
now
bear
my
old
diseased
body
to
my
dwelling
to
repose
and
perhaps
to
die
upon
my
bed
of
not
to
die
i
hope
said
anna
you
must
live
that
you
may
see
us
in
our
greatness
said
the
prince
ostermann
feebly
shook
his
head
i
see
i
see
it
all
said
he
you
will
liberate
yourself
from
one
tyrant
your
highness
to
become
the
prey
of
another
the
eyes
of
the
dying
see
clear
and
i
tell
you
duchess
you
were
already
on
the
point
of
giving
away
the
power
you
have
attained
know
you
what
munnich
s
demand
will
be
well
he
will
demand
what
biron
refused
him
and
for
which
refusal
munnich
became
his
enemy
he
will
ask
you
to
appoint
him
generalissimo
of
all
your
forces
by
land
and
then
will
he
demand
what
naturally
belongs
to
me
said
the
prince
excitedly
and
we
shall
of
course
refuse
yes
we
must
refuse
it
repeated
the
princess
and
in
that
you
will
do
well
said
count
ostermann
i
may
venture
to
say
so
as
i
have
no
longer
the
least
ambition
death
will
soon
relieve
me
from
all
participation
in
affairs
of
state
i
am
a
feeble
old
man
and
desire
nothing
more
than
to
be
allowed
occasionally
to
impart
good
counsels
to
my
benefactors
and
this
is
now
my
advice
guard
yourselves
against
the
ambition
of
count
we
shall
bear
your
counsel
in
mind
said
the
prince
we
will
not
appoint
him
generalissimo
exclaimed
the
princess
he
must
never
forget
that
he
is
our
servant
and
we
his
and
now
permit
me
to
go
your
highness
said
ostermann
will
you
have
the
kindness
prince
to
command
your
lackeys
to
bear
me
to
my
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
walk
a
step
yes
yes
while
you
are
this
night
contending
for
a
throne
i
shall
perhaps
be
struggling
with
and
with
a
groan
sinking
back
into
the
arms
of
the
lackeys
whom
the
prince
had
called
ostermann
suffered
himself
to
be
carried
down
to
his
chair
which
awaited
him
at
the
door
he
groaned
and
cried
out
as
they
placed
him
in
it
but
as
soon
as
its
doors
were
closed
and
his
serfs
were
trotting
with
him
toward
his
own
palace
the
suffering
expression
vanished
from
ostermann
s
face
and
a
sly
smile
of
satisfaction
played
upon
his
lips
i
think
i
have
well
employed
my
time
he
muttered
to
himself
the
good
munnich
will
never
become
generalissimo
and
poor
old
failing
ostermann
may
now
unsuspected
go
quietly
to
bed
and
comfortably
await
the
coming
events
such
an
illness
at
the
right
time
is
an
insurance
against
all
accidents
and
miscarriages
i
learned
that
after
the
death
of
peter
ii
who
knows
what
would
then
have
become
of
me
had
i
not
been
careful
to
remain
sick
in
bed
until
anna
had
mounted
the
throne
i
will
therefore
again
be
sick
and
in
the
morning
we
shall
see
should
this
conjuration
succeed
very
well
then
perhaps
old
ostermann
will
gradually
recover
sufficient
health
to
take
yet
a
few
of
the
burdens
of
state
upon
his
own
shoulders
and
thus
relieve
the
good
munnich
of
a
part
of
his
cares
the
night
of
the
conspiracy
it
was
a
splendid
dinner
that
which
the
regent
had
this
day
prepared
for
his
guests
count
munnich
was
very
much
devoted
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
sitting
near
the
regent
he
gave
himself
wholly
up
to
the
cheerful
humour
which
the
excellent
viands
and
delicate
wines
were
calculated
to
stimulate
at
times
he
entirely
forgot
his
plans
for
the
coming
night
and
then
again
he
would
suddenly
recollect
them
in
the
midst
of
his
gayest
conversation
with
his
host
and
while
volunteering
a
toast
in
praise
of
the
noble
regent
and
closing
it
by
crying
a
long
life
and
reign
to
the
great
regent
biron
von
courland
he
secretly
and
with
a
malicious
pleasure
thought
this
is
thy
last
dinner
sir
duke
a
few
hours
and
those
lips
now
smiling
with
happiness
will
be
forever
silenced
by
our
blows
these
thoughts
made
the
unusually
gay
and
talkative
and
the
regent
protested
that
munnich
had
never
been
a
more
agreeable
than
precisely
therefore
when
the
other
guests
retired
he
begged
of
munnich
to
remain
with
him
awhile
and
the
thinking
it
might
possibly
enable
him
to
prevent
any
warning
reaching
the
regent
consented
to
stay
they
spoke
of
past
times
of
the
happy
days
when
the
empress
anna
yet
reigned
and
when
all
breathed
of
pleasure
and
enjoyment
at
that
happy
court
and
perhaps
it
was
these
recollections
that
rendered
biron
sad
and
thoughtful
he
was
absent
and
and
his
large
flashing
eyes
often
rested
with
piercing
glances
upon
the
calm
and
smiling
face
of
munnich
you
all
envy
me
on
account
of
my
power
and
dominion
said
he
to
munnich
of
that
i
am
not
ignorant
but
you
know
not
with
what
secret
pain
and
anguish
these
few
hours
of
splendor
are
purchased
the
sleepless
nights
in
which
one
fears
seeing
the
doors
open
to
give
admission
to
murderers
and
then
the
dreams
in
which
blood
is
seen
flowing
and
nothing
is
heard
but
and
lamentations
ah
i
hate
the
nights
which
are
inimical
to
all
happiness
in
the
night
will
misfortune
at
some
time
overtake
me
in
the
night
the
evil
spirit
reigns
with
a
drooping
head
the
regent
had
spoken
half
to
himself
but
suddenly
raising
his
head
and
looking
munnich
sharply
in
the
eyes
he
said
have
you
during
your
campaigns
never
in
the
night
foreseen
any
important
event
munnich
shuddered
slightly
and
the
color
forsook
his
cheeks
he
knows
all
and
i
am
lost
thought
he
and
his
hand
involuntarily
sought
his
sword
i
will
defend
myself
to
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
was
his
first
idea
but
biron
although
surprised
saw
nothing
of
the
s
strange
commotion
he
was
wholly
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
and
only
awaited
an
answer
to
his
question
well
he
repeated
tell
me
whether
in
the
night
you
have
ever
had
the
presentiment
of
any
important
event
i
was
just
considering
he
calmly
said
at
this
moment
i
do
not
recollect
ever
having
foreseen
any
extraordinary
event
by
night
but
it
has
always
been
a
principle
of
mine
to
take
advantage
of
every
favorable
opportunity
whether
by
day
or
munnich
remained
with
the
regent
until
eleven
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
then
they
separated
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
the
heartiest
assurances
of
mutual
friendship
and
devotion
ah
that
was
a
hard
trial
said
munnich
breathing
easier
and
deeper
as
he
left
the
palace
of
the
duke
behind
him
i
was
already
convinced
that
all
was
lost
but
this
biron
is
unsuspecting
as
a
child
sleep
now
biron
sleep
in
a
few
hours
i
shall
come
to
awaken
you
and
realize
your
bloody
dream
with
winged
steps
he
hastened
to
his
own
palace
arrived
there
he
summoned
his
adjutant
captain
von
mannstein
and
after
having
briefly
given
him
the
necessary
orders
took
him
with
him
into
his
carriage
for
the
purpose
of
repairing
to
the
palace
of
the
prince
of
brunswick
it
was
a
cold
november
night
of
the
year
the
deserted
streets
were
hushed
in
silence
and
no
one
of
the
occupants
of
the
dark
houses
no
one
on
earth
dreamed
that
this
carriage
whose
rumbling
was
only
half
heard
in
sleep
was
in
a
manner
the
thundering
herald
of
new
times
and
new
lords
munnich
had
chosen
his
time
well
for
if
it
was
forbidden
to
admit
any
one
whatever
during
the
night
to
the
palace
occupied
by
the
young
czar
and
if
also
the
regent
had
given
the
guards
strict
orders
to
shoot
any
one
who
might
attempt
in
spite
of
these
commands
to
penetrate
into
the
forbidden
precincts
this
day
made
an
exception
for
munnich
as
a
portion
of
one
of
his
own
regiments
was
on
duty
at
the
imperial
palace
unimpeded
stayed
by
no
one
munnich
penetrated
to
the
apartments
of
anna
leopoldowna
she
was
awaiting
him
and
at
his
side
she
descended
to
receive
the
homage
of
the
officers
and
soldiers
who
had
been
commanded
by
munnich
to
submit
themselves
to
her
with
glowing
words
she
described
to
the
listening
soldiers
all
the
insults
and
injuries
to
which
the
regent
had
subjected
herself
her
husband
and
their
son
the
emperor
who
can
say
that
this
miserable
biron
is
called
to
fill
so
exalted
a
place
and
to
lord
it
over
you
my
beloved
friends
and
brothers
to
me
as
the
niece
of
the
blessed
empress
anna
to
me
as
the
mother
of
ivan
chosen
as
emperor
by
anna
to
me
alone
belongs
the
regency
and
by
heaven
i
will
reconquer
that
of
which
i
have
been
nefariously
robbed
i
will
punish
this
insolent
upstart
whose
shameful
tyranny
we
have
endured
long
enough
and
i
hope
you
my
friends
will
stand
by
me
and
obey
the
commands
of
your
a
loud
followed
this
speech
of
anna
leopoldowna
who
tenderly
embraced
the
enraptured
officers
commanding
them
to
follow
her
accompanied
by
marshal
munnich
and
eighty
soldiers
anna
then
went
out
into
the
streets
in
silence
they
advanced
to
within
a
hundred
steps
of
biron
s
palace
here
making
a
halt
mannstein
alone
approached
the
palace
to
command
the
officers
of
the
guard
in
the
name
of
the
new
regent
anna
leopoldowna
to
submit
and
pay
homage
to
her
no
opposition
was
made
accustomed
always
to
obey
they
had
not
the
courage
to
dispute
the
commands
of
the
new
ruler
and
declared
themselves
ready
to
assist
her
in
the
arrest
of
the
regent
mannstein
returned
to
anna
and
munnich
with
this
joyful
intelligence
and
received
orders
to
penetrate
into
the
palace
with
twenty
men
to
capture
the
duke
and
even
kill
him
if
he
made
resistance
without
opposition
mannstein
again
returned
to
the
palace
with
his
small
band
carefully
avoiding
making
the
least
noise
in
his
approach
all
the
soldiers
in
the
palace
knew
him
and
as
the
watch
below
had
permitted
him
to
pass
they
supposed
he
must
have
an
important
message
for
the
duke
and
no
one
stopped
him
he
had
already
wandered
through
several
rooms
when
an
unforeseen
difficulty
presented
itself
where
is
the
of
the
duke
which
way
must
he
turn
in
order
to
find
him
he
stood
there
undecided
not
daring
to
ask
any
of
the
attendants
in
the
anterooms
lest
perhaps
they
might
suspect
him
and
awaken
the
duke
he
finally
resolved
to
go
forward
and
trust
to
accident
he
passed
two
or
three
chambers
all
were
empty
all
was
still
now
he
stands
before
a
closed
door
what
if
that
should
prove
the
chamber
of
the
duke
he
thinks
he
hears
a
breathing
he
cautiously
tries
the
door
slightly
closed
it
yields
to
his
pressure
and
he
enters
there
stands
a
huge
bed
with
hanging
curtains
which
are
boldly
drawn
aside
by
mannstein
before
him
lies
the
regent
duke
biron
of
courland
with
his
wife
by
his
side
duke
biron
awake
called
mannstein
with
a
loud
voice
the
ducal
pair
started
up
from
their
slumber
with
a
shriek
of
terror
biron
leaps
from
the
bed
but
mannstein
overpowers
him
and
holds
him
fast
until
his
soldiers
come
the
duke
defends
himself
with
his
hands
but
is
beaten
down
with
they
bind
his
hands
with
an
officer
s
scarf
they
wrap
him
in
a
soldier
s
mantle
and
so
convey
him
down
to
munnich
s
carriage
which
is
waiting
below
to
transport
him
to
the
winter
palace
while
mannstein
and
the
soldiers
were
occupied
with
the
duke
his
duchess
had
found
an
opportunity
to
make
her
escape
with
only
her
light
shrieking
and
lamenting
she
had
rushed
into
the
street
she
was
seized
by
a
soldier
who
conducting
her
to
mannstein
asked
what
he
should
do
with
her
take
her
back
into
the
palace
said
mannstein
hastening
past
but
the
soldier
only
anxious
to
rid
himself
of
an
encumbrance
threw
the
now
insensible
duchess
into
the
snow
and
hurried
away
in
this
situation
she
was
found
by
a
captain
of
the
guard
who
lifted
her
up
and
conveyed
her
into
the
palace
to
give
her
over
to
the
care
of
her
women
that
she
might
be
restored
to
consciousness
and
dressed
but
she
no
longer
had
either
women
or
servants
her
reign
is
over
they
have
all
fled
in
terror
as
from
the
house
of
death
that
they
may
not
be
involved
in
the
disaster
of
those
whose
good
fortunes
they
have
shared
the
slaves
had
all
decamped
in
search
of
new
masters
and
the
regent
s
palace
so
often
humbly
and
reverently
sought
is
now
avoided
as
a
with
trembling
hands
the
duchess
enveloped
herself
in
her
clothes
and
then
followed
her
husband
into
the
winter
palace
and
while
all
this
was
taking
place
the
court
and
nation
yet
trembled
at
the
names
of
these
two
persons
who
had
just
been
so
deeply
humbled
the
princess
anna
leopoldowna
accompanied
by
the
shouting
soldiery
made
a
triumphant
progress
through
the
streets
of
the
city
stopping
at
all
the
caserns
to
receive
the
oaths
and
homage
of
the
regiments
this
was
consummated
without
the
shedding
of
blood
and
the
awaking
people
of
petersburg
found
themselves
with
astonishment
under
a
new
regency
and
new
masters
but
a
population
of
slaves
venture
no
opposition
whoever
may
have
the
power
to
declare
and
maintain
himself
their
ruler
he
is
their
master
and
the
slavish
horde
bow
humbly
before
him
as
hardly
four
weeks
previously
the
great
magnates
of
the
realm
had
hurried
to
the
duke
of
courland
to
pay
their
homage
and
prostrate
themselves
in
the
dust
before
him
so
did
they
now
hasten
to
the
palace
of
the
new
regent
humbly
to
pay
their
court
to
her
the
same
lips
that
even
yesterday
swore
eternal
fidelity
to
the
regent
biron
and
sounded
his
praise
to
the
skies
now
condemned
him
and
as
loudly
commended
their
august
new
mistress
anna
leopoldowna
the
same
knees
which
had
yesterday
bent
to
biron
now
bent
before
anna
and
with
tears
of
joy
men
now
again
sank
into
the
arms
of
each
other
loudly
congratulating
their
noble
russia
upon
which
the
sun
of
happiness
had
now
risen
given
her
anna
leopoldowna
as
regent
and
while
all
was
jubilation
in
the
palace
of
the
new
regent
that
of
the
great
man
of
yesterday
stood
silent
and
deserted
no
one
dared
to
raise
a
voice
in
his
favor
those
who
yesterday
revelled
at
his
table
and
sang
his
praises
were
his
bitterest
enemies
cursing
him
the
louder
the
more
they
had
lauded
him
yesterday
magnificent
festivals
were
celebrated
in
petersburg
in
honor
of
the
new
regent
while
they
were
at
the
same
time
trying
the
old
one
and
condemning
him
to
death
but
anna
leopoldowna
mitigated
his
punishment
what
a
mitigation
by
changing
the
sentence
of
death
into
that
of
perpetual
banishment
to
siberia
hopes
deceived
tranquillity
was
again
established
in
russia
once
again
all
faces
were
lighted
up
with
joy
at
this
new
state
of
affairs
and
again
the
people
congratulated
themselves
on
the
good
fortune
of
the
russian
empire
all
this
was
done
four
weeks
previously
when
biron
took
upon
himself
the
regency
and
the
same
will
be
done
again
when
another
comes
to
overthrow
the
regent
anna
it
was
on
the
day
after
this
new
revolution
when
munnich
entering
the
palace
with
a
proud
step
and
elevated
head
requested
an
interview
with
the
regent
your
highness
he
said
not
bending
the
knee
before
his
sovereign
as
custom
demanded
but
only
slightly
pressing
her
hand
to
his
lips
your
highness
i
have
redeemed
my
word
and
fulfilled
my
promise
i
promised
to
liberate
you
from
biron
and
make
you
regent
and
i
have
kept
my
word
now
madame
it
is
for
you
to
fulfil
your
pledge
you
solemnly
promised
that
when
i
should
succeed
in
making
you
regent
you
would
immediately
and
unconditionally
grant
me
whatever
i
might
demand
well
now
you
are
regent
and
i
come
to
proffer
my
request
it
will
make
me
happy
to
discharge
a
small
part
of
my
obligations
toward
you
by
yielding
to
your
demand
ask
quickly
that
i
may
the
sooner
give
said
anna
leopoldowna
with
an
engaging
smile
make
me
the
generalissimo
of
your
forces
responded
munnich
in
an
almost
commanding
tone
a
cloud
gathered
over
the
smiling
features
of
the
regent
why
must
you
ask
precisely
this
this
one
only
favor
which
it
is
no
longer
in
my
power
to
bestow
she
sadly
said
there
are
so
many
offices
so
many
influential
positions
ah
i
could
prove
my
gratitude
to
you
in
so
many
ways
ask
for
money
treasures
landed
estates
all
these
it
is
in
my
power
to
give
why
must
you
demand
precisely
that
which
is
no
longer
mine
munnich
stared
at
her
with
widely
opened
eyes
trembling
lips
and
pallid
cheeks
his
head
swam
and
he
thought
he
could
not
have
rightly
heard
i
hope
this
is
only
a
misunderstanding
he
stammered
i
must
have
heard
wrong
it
can
not
be
your
intention
to
refuse
would
to
god
it
were
yet
in
my
power
to
gratify
you
sighed
the
regent
but
i
can
not
give
what
is
no
longer
mine
why
came
you
not
a
few
hours
earlier
then
it
would
have
been
yet
possible
to
comply
with
your
request
but
now
it
is
too
late
you
have
then
appointed
another
generalissimo
shrieked
munnich
quivering
with
rage
yes
said
anna
smiling
and
see
there
comes
my
generalissimo
it
was
the
regent
s
husband
prince
ulrich
von
brunswick
who
that
moment
entered
the
room
and
calmly
greeted
munnich
you
have
here
a
rival
my
husband
said
the
princess
without
embarrassment
and
had
i
not
already
signed
your
diploma
it
is
very
questionable
whether
i
should
now
do
it
now
that
i
know
count
munich
desires
the
i
hope
proudly
responded
the
prince
count
munnich
will
comprehend
that
this
position
which
places
the
whole
power
of
the
empire
in
the
hands
of
him
who
holds
it
is
suitable
only
for
the
father
of
the
emperor
count
munnich
made
no
answer
already
so
near
the
attainment
of
his
end
he
saw
it
again
elude
his
grasp
again
had
he
labored
struggled
in
vain
this
was
the
second
revolution
which
he
had
brought
about
with
this
his
favorite
plan
in
view
two
regents
were
indebted
to
him
for
their
greatness
and
both
had
refused
him
the
one
thing
for
which
he
had
made
them
regents
neither
had
been
willing
to
create
him
generalissimo
in
this
moment
munnich
felt
unable
to
conceal
his
rage
under
an
assumed
tranquillity
pretending
a
sudden
attack
of
illness
he
begged
permission
to
retire
tottering
scarcely
in
possession
of
his
senses
he
hastened
through
the
hall
thronged
with
petitioners
all
bowed
before
him
all
reverently
saluted
him
but
to
him
it
seemed
that
he
could
read
nothing
but
mockery
and
malicious
joy
upon
all
those
smiling
faces
ah
he
could
have
crushed
them
all
and
trodden
them
under
his
feet
in
his
inextinguishable
rage
when
he
finally
reached
his
carriage
and
his
proud
steeds
were
bearing
him
swiftly
away
when
none
could
any
longer
see
him
then
he
gave
vent
to
furious
execrations
and
tears
of
rage
flowed
from
his
eyes
he
tore
out
his
hair
and
smote
his
breast
he
felt
himself
wandering
frantic
with
rage
and
despair
one
thought
one
wish
had
occupied
him
for
many
long
years
he
had
labored
and
striven
for
it
he
wished
to
be
the
first
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
russian
empire
he
would
control
the
military
force
and
in
his
hands
should
rest
the
means
of
giving
the
country
peace
or
war
that
was
what
he
wanted
that
was
what
he
had
labored
for
and
now
oh
biron
biron
he
faintly
groaned
why
must
i
overthrow
you
you
loved
me
and
perhaps
would
one
day
have
accorded
me
what
you
at
first
refused
biron
i
have
betrayed
you
with
a
kiss
it
is
your
guardian
angel
who
is
now
avenging
you
thus
he
reached
his
palace
and
the
servants
who
opened
the
door
of
his
carriage
started
back
with
alarm
at
the
fearful
expression
of
their
master
s
face
it
had
become
of
an
ashen
gray
his
blue
lips
quivered
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
threaten
those
who
dared
approach
him
alighting
in
silence
he
strode
on
through
the
rows
of
his
trembling
servants
suddenly
two
of
his
lackeys
fell
upon
their
knees
before
him
weeping
and
sobbing
they
stretched
forth
their
hands
to
him
begging
for
mercy
what
have
they
done
asked
he
of
his
feodor
has
had
the
misfortune
to
break
your
excellency
s
and
ivanovitch
bears
the
blame
of
suffering
your
greyhound
artemisia
to
a
strange
joy
suddenly
lighted
up
the
brow
of
the
count
ah
said
he
breathing
more
freely
and
stretching
himself
up
ah
i
thank
god
that
i
now
have
some
one
on
whom
i
can
wreak
my
vengeance
and
kicking
the
unfortunate
weeping
and
writhing
servants
who
were
crawling
in
the
dust
before
him
munnich
cried
no
mercy
you
hounds
no
no
mercy
you
shall
be
scourged
until
you
have
breathed
out
your
miserable
lives
the
knout
here
strike
i
will
look
on
from
my
windows
and
see
that
my
commands
are
executed
ah
i
will
teach
you
to
break
my
cups
and
let
my
hounds
escape
scourge
them
unto
death
i
will
see
their
blood
their
red
smoking
blood
the
stationed
himself
at
his
open
window
the
servants
had
formed
a
close
circle
around
the
unhappy
beings
who
were
receiving
their
punishment
in
the
court
below
the
air
was
filled
with
the
shrieks
of
the
tortured
men
blood
flowed
in
streams
over
their
flayed
backs
and
at
every
new
stroke
of
the
knout
they
howled
and
shrieked
for
mercy
while
at
every
new
shriek
munnich
cried
out
to
his
executioners
no
no
mercy
no
pity
scourge
the
culprits
i
would
i
must
see
blood
scourge
them
to
death
trembling
the
band
of
servants
looked
on
with
folded
hands
with
a
savage
smile
upon
his
face
stood
count
munnich
at
his
window
above
weaker
and
weaker
grew
the
cries
of
the
unhappy
sufferers
they
no
longer
prayed
for
mercy
the
knout
continued
to
flay
their
bodies
but
their
blood
no
longer
flowed
they
were
dead
the
surrounding
servants
folded
their
hands
in
prayer
for
the
souls
of
the
deceased
and
then
loudly
commended
the
mild
justice
of
their
master
retiring
from
the
window
count
munnich
ordered
his
breakfast
to
be
served
such
horribly
cruel
punishments
of
the
serfs
were
at
that
time
no
uncommon
occurrence
in
russia
unhappy
serfs
were
daily
scourged
to
death
at
the
command
of
their
masters
moreover
princes
and
generals
and
even
respectable
ladies
were
scourged
with
the
knout
at
the
command
of
the
emperor
yet
these
punishments
in
russia
had
nothing
dishonoring
in
them
the
empress
catharine
ii
had
three
of
her
court
ladies
stripped
and
scourged
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
court
for
having
drawn
some
offensive
caricatures
of
the
great
empress
one
of
these
scourged
ladies
afterward
married
to
a
russian
magnate
was
sent
by
catharine
as
a
sort
of
ambassadress
to
sweden
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
the
king
of
sweden
to
favor
some
of
her
political
memoires
secrets
sur
la
russie
par
masson
vol
from
that
time
forward
however
munnich
s
life
was
a
continuous
chain
of
vexations
and
mortifications
as
his
inordinate
ambition
was
known
he
was
constantly
suspected
and
was
reprehended
with
inexorable
severity
for
every
fault
it
is
true
the
regent
raised
him
to
the
post
of
first
minister
but
ostermann
who
recovered
his
health
after
the
successful
termination
of
the
revolutionary
enterprise
by
various
intrigues
attained
to
the
position
of
minister
of
foreign
affairs
while
to
golopkin
was
given
the
department
of
the
interior
so
that
only
the
war
department
remained
to
the
first
minister
munnich
he
had
originated
and
accomplished
two
revolutions
that
he
might
become
generalissimo
and
had
obtained
nothing
but
mortifications
and
humiliations
that
embittered
every
moment
of
his
life
the
regent
anna
leopoldowna
anna
had
succeeded
she
was
regent
she
had
shaken
off
the
burden
of
the
bironic
tutelage
and
her
word
was
throughout
the
immeasurable
provinces
of
the
russian
empire
was
she
now
happy
this
proud
and
powerful
anna
leopoldowna
no
one
had
ever
yet
been
happy
and
free
from
care
upon
this
russian
throne
and
how
then
could
anna
leopoldowna
be
so
she
had
read
the
books
of
russian
political
history
and
that
history
was
written
with
blood
anna
was
a
woman
and
she
trembled
when
thinking
of
the
poison
the
dagger
the
throttling
hands
and
flaying
sword
which
had
constantly
beset
the
throne
of
russian
and
in
a
manner
had
been
the
means
in
the
hands
of
providence
of
clearing
it
from
one
tyrant
only
indeed
to
make
room
for
another
anna
as
we
have
said
trembled
before
this
means
of
providence
and
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
munnich
upon
his
dark
angry
brow
and
his
secretly
threatening
glance
she
then
with
inward
terror
asked
herself
may
not
providence
have
chosen
him
for
my
murderer
will
he
not
overthrow
me
as
he
overthrew
his
former
master
and
friend
duke
biron
anna
now
feared
him
whom
she
had
chiefly
to
thank
for
her
greatness
at
the
time
when
he
had
made
her
regent
he
had
satisfactorily
shown
that
his
arm
was
sufficiently
powerful
to
displace
one
regent
and
hurl
him
to
the
dust
what
he
had
once
done
might
not
he
now
be
able
to
accomplish
again
she
surrounded
this
feared
with
spies
and
listeners
she
caused
all
his
actions
to
be
watched
every
one
of
his
words
to
be
repeated
to
her
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
it
had
not
some
concealed
sense
some
threatening
secret
she
doubled
the
guards
of
her
palace
and
always
trembling
with
fear
she
no
longer
dared
to
occupy
any
one
of
her
apartments
continuously
nomadically
wandered
they
about
in
their
own
palace
this
regent
anna
leopoldowna
and
her
husband
prince
ulrich
of
brunswick
remembering
the
of
biron
she
dared
not
select
any
one
distinct
apartment
for
constant
occupation
every
evening
found
her
in
a
new
room
every
night
she
reposed
in
a
different
bed
and
even
her
most
trusted
servant
often
knew
not
in
which
wing
of
the
castle
the
princely
pair
were
to
pass
the
night
she
before
whom
these
millions
of
russian
subjects
humbled
themselves
in
the
dust
trembled
every
night
in
her
bed
at
the
slightest
rustling
at
the
whisperings
of
the
wind
at
every
breath
of
air
that
beat
her
closed
and
bolted
doors
she
might
it
is
true
have
released
herself
from
these
torments
with
the
utterance
of
only
one
word
of
command
it
required
only
a
wave
of
her
hand
to
send
this
haughty
and
dangerous
munnich
to
siberia
nor
was
an
excuse
for
such
a
proceeding
wanting
count
munnich
s
pride
and
presumption
daily
gave
occasion
for
anger
he
daily
gave
offence
by
his
reckless
disregard
and
disrespect
for
his
chief
the
generalissimo
prince
ulrich
daily
was
it
necessary
to
correct
him
and
to
confine
him
within
his
own
proper
official
boundaries
and
such
refractory
conduct
toward
a
russian
master
had
it
not
in
all
times
been
a
terrible
and
execrable
crime
a
crime
for
which
banishment
to
siberia
had
always
been
considered
a
mild
punishment
poor
anna
called
to
rule
over
russia
she
lacked
only
the
first
and
most
necessary
qualification
for
her
position
a
russian
heart
there
was
in
this
german
woman
s
disposition
too
much
gentleness
and
mildness
too
much
confiding
goodness
to
a
less
barbarous
people
she
might
have
been
a
blessing
a
merciful
ruler
and
gracious
benefactor
but
her
arm
was
too
weak
to
wield
the
knout
instead
of
the
sceptre
over
this
people
of
slaves
her
heart
too
soft
to
judge
with
inexorable
severity
according
to
the
barbarous
russian
laws
which
never
pardoning
always
condemn
and
flay
it
was
this
which
gradually
estranged
from
her
the
hearts
of
the
russians
they
felt
that
it
was
no
russian
who
reigned
over
them
and
because
they
had
no
occasion
to
tremble
and
creep
in
the
dust
before
her
they
almost
despised
her
and
derided
the
idyllic
sentiments
of
this
good
german
princess
who
wished
to
realize
her
fantastic
dreams
by
treating
a
horde
of
barbarians
as
a
civilized
people
the
slaves
longed
for
their
former
yoke
they
looked
around
them
with
a
feeling
of
strangeness
and
to
them
it
seemed
unnatural
not
everywhere
to
see
the
brandished
knout
the
avenging
scaffold
and
the
departing
for
siberia
much
as
ostermann
importuned
her
often
as
her
own
husband
warned
her
anna
nevertheless
refused
she
would
not
banish
munnich
to
siberia
but
remained
firm
in
her
determination
to
leave
him
in
possession
of
his
liberty
and
his
dignities
but
when
munnich
himself
excited
and
fatigued
with
these
annoyances
and
moreover
believing
that
anna
could
not
do
without
him
and
therefore
would
not
grant
his
request
finally
demanded
his
dismission
anna
granted
it
with
joy
and
munnich
deceived
in
all
his
ambitious
plans
and
expectations
angrily
left
the
court
to
betake
himself
to
his
palace
beyond
the
neva
anna
now
breathed
easier
she
now
felt
herself
powerful
and
free
for
munnich
was
as
least
removed
farther
from
her
his
residence
was
no
longer
separated
from
hers
only
by
a
wall
she
had
no
longer
to
fear
his
breaking
through
in
the
night
ah
munnich
dwelt
beyond
the
neva
and
a
whole
regiment
guarded
its
banks
and
bridges
by
night
munnich
could
no
longer
fall
upon
her
by
surprise
as
she
could
have
him
always
watched
anna
no
longer
trembled
with
fear
she
could
yield
to
her
natural
indolence
and
if
she
sometimes
from
fear
of
munnich
troubled
herself
about
state
affairs
and
labored
with
her
ministers
she
now
felt
it
to
be
an
oppressive
burden
to
which
she
could
no
longer
consent
to
subject
herself
satiated
and
exhausted
she
in
some
measure
left
the
wielding
of
the
sceptre
to
her
first
and
confidential
minister
count
golopkin
he
ruled
in
her
name
as
count
ostermann
was
generalissimo
in
the
name
of
her
husband
the
prince
of
brunswick
why
trouble
themselves
with
the
pains
and
cares
of
governing
when
it
was
permitted
them
to
only
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
their
position
the
minister
might
flourish
the
knout
and
proclaim
the
siberian
banishment
over
the
trembling
people
the
scourged
might
howl
and
the
banished
might
lament
the
great
and
powerful
might
dispose
of
the
souls
and
bodies
of
their
serfs
rare
honesty
might
be
oppressed
by
consuming
usury
offices
honors
and
titles
might
be
gambled
for
justice
and
punishment
might
be
bought
and
sold
vice
and
immorality
might
universally
prevail
anna
would
not
know
it
she
would
neither
see
nor
hear
any
thing
of
this
outside
world
the
palace
is
her
world
in
which
she
is
happy
in
which
she
revels
ah
that
charming
silent
little
boudoir
with
is
soft
turkish
carpet
with
its
elastic
divans
and
heavily
curtained
windows
and
doors
that
little
boudoir
is
now
her
paradise
the
temple
of
her
happiness
in
it
she
lingers
and
in
it
is
she
blessed
there
she
reposes
dreaming
of
past
delightful
hours
or
smiling
with
the
intoxication
of
the
still
more
delightful
present
in
the
arms
of
the
one
she
loves
the
favorite
see
how
her
eyes
flash
how
her
heart
beats
how
beautiful
she
is
in
the
warm
glow
of
excitement
this
beautiful
anna
leopoldowna
the
door
opens
and
a
smiling
young
maiden
looks
in
with
many
a
nod
of
her
little
head
ah
is
it
you
my
julia
calls
the
princess
opening
her
arms
to
press
the
young
girl
to
her
heart
come
i
will
kiss
you
and
imagine
it
is
he
who
receives
the
kiss
ah
what
would
this
poor
anna
leopoldowna
be
if
deprived
of
her
dear
friend
julia
von
mengden
and
drawing
her
favorite
down
into
her
lap
she
continued
now
relate
to
me
julia
set
your
tongue
in
motion
that
i
may
hear
one
of
your
very
pleasantest
stories
that
will
divert
me
and
cause
the
long
hours
before
his
coming
to
pass
more
julia
von
mengden
roguishly
shook
her
beautifully
curling
locks
with
a
comic
earnestness
and
very
aptly
and
unmistakably
imitating
the
somewhat
hoarse
and
nasal
voice
of
prince
ulrich
said
your
grace
forgets
that
you
are
regent
and
have
to
hold
the
reins
of
government
in
the
name
of
the
illustrious
imperial
squaller
your
son
since
his
imperial
grace
still
remains
in
his
and
has
much
less
to
do
with
state
affairs
than
with
many
other
little
occupations
anna
leopoldowna
breaking
out
in
joyous
laughter
exultingly
clapped
her
little
hands
which
were
sparkling
with
brilliants
this
is
superb
said
she
you
play
the
part
of
my
very
worthy
husband
to
perfection
it
is
as
if
one
saw
and
heard
him
ah
i
would
that
he
resembled
you
a
little
as
he
would
then
be
less
insupportable
and
it
would
be
somewhat
easier
to
endure
julia
von
mengden
making
no
answer
to
this
remark
continued
with
her
nasal
voice
and
comic
pathos
your
grace
this
is
not
the
time
to
analyze
our
diverting
little
domestic
dissensions
and
occupy
ourselves
with
the
quiet
joys
of
our
happy
union
your
grace
is
above
all
things
regent
and
must
give
your
attention
to
state
affairs
without
are
standing
three
most
worthy
corpulent
ambassadors
who
desire
an
audience
your
grace
is
above
all
things
regent
and
must
receive
must
exclaimed
anna
suddenly
contracting
her
brows
we
will
first
hear
what
they
desire
of
the
first
is
the
envoy
of
the
great
persian
conqueror
who
comes
to
lay
at
your
feet
the
magnificent
presents
of
his
bah
they
are
presents
for
the
young
emperor
ivan
he
may
therefore
be
conducted
to
the
cradle
of
my
son
and
there
display
his
presents
it
does
not
interest
the
second
is
a
messenger
from
our
camp
he
brings
news
of
a
great
victory
obtained
by
one
of
your
brave
generals
over
the
swedes
but
what
does
that
concern
me
angrily
cried
the
regent
let
them
conquer
or
be
defeated
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
that
concerns
my
husband
the
generalissimo
let
me
be
spared
the
sight
of
the
warlike
and
messenger
the
third
is
the
ambassador
of
the
wavering
and
shaking
young
austrian
empress
maria
theresa
he
comes
he
says
upon
a
secret
mission
and
pretends
to
have
discovered
a
sort
of
conspiracy
that
is
hatching
against
let
him
go
with
his
discovery
to
golopkin
our
minister
of
the
interior
that
is
his
business
your
grace
is
above
all
things
regent
and
should
remember
nothing
i
will
remember
nothing
exclaimed
anna
leopoldowna
interrupting
her
favorite
i
will
not
be
annoyed
that
is
well
thank
god
now
cried
julia
von
mengden
in
her
natural
tone
thank
god
that
such
is
your
determination
princess
you
are
then
in
earnest
and
i
am
to
send
these
three
amiable
persons
to
the
devil
or
what
is
just
the
same
to
your
husband
that
is
my
and
this
is
beautiful
in
you
continued
julia
cowering
down
before
her
mistress
these
eternal
tiresome
and
intolerable
state
affairs
would
make
your
face
prematurely
old
and
wrinkled
my
dear
princess
ah
there
is
nothing
more
tedious
than
governing
i
am
heartily
sick
of
it
at
first
i
was
amused
when
we
two
sat
together
and
settled
who
should
be
sent
to
prison
and
who
should
be
pardoned
whom
we
should
make
counts
and
princes
or
degrade
to
the
ranks
as
common
soldiers
but
all
that
pleased
only
for
a
short
time
now
it
is
annoying
and
why
should
we
take
upon
ourselves
this
trouble
have
we
not
the
power
to
act
and
live
according
to
our
own
good
pleasure
bah
that
is
the
least
compensation
you
should
receive
for
allowing
these
horrid
russians
the
privilege
of
calling
you
their
regent
and
mistress
but
my
little
chatterer
you
forget
the
three
envoys
who
are
waiting
without
said
anna
with
a
smile
ah
that
is
true
i
must
first
send
those
away
said
anna
tenderly
looking
after
her
departing
favorite
she
is
indeed
my
good
genius
who
drives
away
the
cares
from
my
poor
so
it
is
done
cried
julia
quickly
returning
to
the
room
i
have
sent
the
gentlemen
away
to
the
persian
envoy
i
said
go
to
our
emperor
ivan
he
feeds
upon
brilliants
and
as
he
has
had
no
breakfast
this
morning
his
appetite
will
be
good
go
therefore
and
give
him
your
diamonds
for
breakfast
anna
leopoldowna
wants
them
not
she
is
already
satiated
with
them
to
the
second
i
said
go
and
announce
your
glorious
victory
to
our
sublime
generalissimo
he
is
at
his
toilet
and
as
he
every
morning
touches
his
noble
cheeks
with
rouge
your
new
paint
prepared
from
the
purple
blood
of
the
enemy
will
doubtless
be
very
welcome
to
him
and
as
to
what
concerns
your
secret
mission
and
your
discovered
conspiracy
said
i
to
the
austrian
ambassador
i
am
sorry
that
you
can
not
here
give
birth
to
the
dear
children
of
your
inventive
head
go
with
them
to
our
midwife
minister
golopkin
and
hasten
a
little
for
i
see
in
your
face
that
you
are
already
in
the
pangs
of
parturition
well
asked
anna
leopoldowna
loudly
laughing
what
said
their
worships
to
that
what
did
they
say
they
said
nothing
they
were
dumb
and
looked
astonished
they
made
exactly
such
eyes
as
i
have
seen
made
at
home
upon
my
father
s
estate
in
liefland
by
the
calves
when
the
butcher
knocked
them
upon
the
head
but
now
continued
julia
nestling
again
at
the
feet
of
her
mistress
now
give
me
a
token
of
your
favor
and
forget
for
a
while
that
you
are
regent
let
us
chat
a
little
like
a
couple
of
real
genuine
women
that
is
of
our
husbands
and
lovers
oh
i
have
very
important
news
for
you
well
speak
quickly
said
anna
with
eagerness
what
have
you
to
tell
me
julia
assumed
a
very
serious
and
important
countenance
the
first
and
most
important
piece
of
news
is
that
your
husband
prince
ulrich
of
brunswick
is
very
jealous
of
me
and
yet
of
one
other
bah
said
anna
contemptuously
let
him
be
jealous
i
do
not
trouble
myself
about
it
and
shall
always
do
as
i
no
no
that
will
not
do
seriously
responded
julia
it
is
so
tiresome
to
always
hear
the
wrangling
and
growling
of
a
jealous
husband
i
tell
your
grace
that
i
must
have
quiet
in
his
presence
i
can
no
longer
bear
his
grim
looks
and
his
constant
anger
and
abuse
you
must
soothe
him
princess
anna
or
i
will
run
away
from
this
horrible
court
where
a
poor
maiden
is
not
allowed
to
have
her
friend
and
mistress
the
charming
princess
anna
leopoldowna
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
the
regent
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
my
julia
she
tremulously
said
can
you
seriously
think
of
leaving
me
see
you
not
that
i
should
be
thereby
rendered
very
solitary
and
miserable
and
raising
up
her
favorite
into
her
arms
she
kissed
her
julia
s
bright
eyes
also
filled
with
tears
think
you
then
princess
that
i
could
ever
leave
ever
be
separated
from
you
she
tenderly
asked
no
my
princess
anna
has
such
entire
possession
of
my
heart
that
it
has
no
room
for
any
other
feeling
than
the
most
unbounded
love
and
devotion
to
my
dear
my
adored
princess
but
for
the
very
reason
that
i
love
you
i
can
not
bear
to
have
your
husband
fill
the
palace
with
his
jealous
complaints
and
thus
publishing
to
petersburg
and
all
the
world
your
unfaithfulness
and
criminal
intrigues
oh
i
tell
you
i
see
through
this
generalissimo
i
know
all
his
plans
and
secret
designs
he
would
gladly
be
able
to
convict
you
of
infidelity
to
him
then
with
the
help
of
the
army
he
commands
declare
his
criminal
wife
unfit
for
the
regency
and
then
make
himself
regent
he
has
a
cunningly
devised
plan
but
which
my
superior
cunning
shall
bring
to
naught
i
will
play
him
a
trick
but
no
i
will
tell
you
no
more
now
at
the
right
time
you
shall
know
all
now
princess
anna
now
answer
me
one
question
do
you
then
so
very
much
love
this
count
lynar
the
princess
looked
up
with
a
dreamy
smile
do
i
love
him
she
then
murmured
low
oh
my
god
thou
knowest
how
truly
how
glowingly
my
heart
clings
to
him
thou
knowest
that
of
all
the
world
i
have
never
loved
any
other
man
than
him
alone
and
you
julia
you
who
know
every
emotion
and
palpitation
of
my
heart
you
yet
ask
me
if
i
love
him
when
he
stood
before
me
in
all
his
proud
manly
beauty
with
his
conquering
glance
his
smile
ah
my
whole
heart
already
then
flew
to
meet
him
i
revelled
in
the
sight
of
him
i
thought
only
of
him
i
spoke
to
him
in
my
thoughts
and
my
prayers
i
loved
only
when
i
saw
him
and
that
happy
that
day
when
he
confessed
his
love
when
he
lay
at
my
feet
and
swore
eternal
truth
to
me
ah
why
could
i
not
have
died
on
that
day
i
was
then
happy
poor
princess
anna
said
julia
sympathetically
they
soon
grudged
you
that
happiness
yes
continued
anna
with
a
bitter
smile
yes
the
virtuous
empress
anna
blushed
in
the
arms
of
her
lover
biron
at
this
aberration
of
her
sold
and
coupled
niece
she
found
it
very
revolting
that
the
poor
anna
leopoldowna
dared
to
have
a
heart
of
her
own
and
to
feel
a
real
love
they
must
therefore
rob
her
of
the
only
happiness
heaven
had
vouchsafed
her
consequently
they
wrote
to
warsaw
asking
nay
commanding
the
recall
of
the
ambassador
and
lynar
was
compelled
to
leave
ah
i
well
know
how
unhappy
you
were
at
that
time
said
julia
pressing
the
hand
of
the
princess
to
her
bosom
how
you
wept
how
you
wrung
your
hands
and
how
i
nowhere
found
mercy
or
commiseration
interposed
anna
with
bitterness
neither
on
earth
nor
in
heaven
i
was
and
remained
deserted
and
solitary
and
was
compelled
to
marry
this
prince
ulrich
of
brunswick
for
whom
i
felt
nothing
but
a
chilling
mortal
indifference
but
you
must
know
julia
that
when
i
stood
with
this
man
at
the
altar
and
was
compelled
to
become
his
wife
i
thought
only
of
him
i
loved
i
vowed
eternal
love
only
to
lynar
and
when
the
prince
folded
me
in
his
arms
as
his
wife
then
was
my
god
gracious
to
me
and
in
a
happy
deception
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
my
lover
who
held
me
in
his
arms
i
thought
only
of
him
and
breathed
only
his
name
and
loved
him
kissed
him
and
became
his
wife
although
he
was
far
alas
so
immeasurably
far
from
me
and
when
i
felt
a
second
self
under
my
heart
i
then
loved
with
redoubled
warmth
the
distant
one
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
years
and
when
ivan
was
born
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
eyes
of
my
lover
looked
at
me
through
his
and
blessed
my
son
whose
spiritual
father
he
was
and
my
child
what
think
you
gave
me
the
courage
to
overthrow
biron
and
assume
the
regency
ah
it
was
only
that
i
might
have
the
power
to
recall
lynar
to
my
side
i
would
and
must
be
regent
that
i
might
demand
the
return
of
lynar
as
ambassador
from
warsaw
that
gave
me
courage
and
decision
that
enabled
me
to
overcome
all
timidity
and
anxiety
i
thought
only
of
him
and
when
the
end
was
attained
when
i
was
declared
regent
the
first
exercise
of
my
power
was
to
recall
lynar
to
court
julia
what
a
happy
day
was
that
when
i
saw
him
again
and
the
princess
wholly
absorbed
in
her
delightful
reminiscences
smilingly
and
silently
reclined
upon
the
cushions
of
the
divan
ah
it
must
be
love
that
so
thinks
and
feels
thoughtfully
observed
julia
i
no
longer
ask
you
princess
anna
if
you
love
the
count
i
now
know
you
do
but
answer
me
yet
one
question
have
you
confidence
in
me
full
unlimited
confidence
will
you
never
mistake
never
doubt
me
never
said
anna
leopoldowna
confidently
and
if
all
the
world
should
tell
me
that
julia
von
mengden
is
a
traitress
i
would
nevertheless
firmly
rely
upon
you
and
reply
to
the
whole
world
that
is
false
julia
von
mengden
is
true
and
pure
as
gold
i
shall
always
love
julia
gratefully
glanced
up
to
the
heavens
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
thank
you
princess
she
then
said
with
a
happy
smile
i
now
have
courage
for
all
you
shall
now
be
enabled
to
love
your
lynar
without
fear
or
trembling
and
your
husband
s
clouded
brow
and
reproaching
tongue
shall
molest
us
no
more
confide
in
me
and
ask
no
questions
it
is
all
decided
and
arranged
in
my
mind
but
hark
do
you
hear
nothing
anna
s
face
was
transfused
with
a
purple
glow
and
her
eyes
flashed
it
is
my
beloved
said
she
yes
it
is
he
i
know
his
step
julia
smilingly
opened
the
concealed
door
and
count
lynar
with
a
cry
of
joy
rushed
to
the
feet
of
his
beloved
at
length
he
exclaimed
clasping
her
feet
and
pressing
them
to
his
bosom
yes
at
length
murmured
anna
looking
down
upon
him
with
a
celestial
smile
julia
stood
at
a
distance
contemplating
them
with
thoughtful
glances
they
should
be
happy
she
murmured
low
and
then
asked
aloud
count
lynar
did
you
receive
my
letter
i
did
receive
it
said
the
count
and
may
god
reward
you
for
the
sacrifice
you
are
so
generously
disposed
to
make
for
us
anna
your
friend
julia
is
our
good
angel
to
her
we
shall
owe
it
if
our
happiness
is
henceforth
indestructible
and
indissoluble
do
you
know
the
immense
sacrifice
this
young
maiden
proposes
to
make
for
us
no
princess
anna
knows
nothing
and
shall
know
nothing
of
it
said
julia
with
a
grand
air
princess
anna
shall
only
know
that
i
love
her
and
am
ready
to
give
my
life
for
her
and
now
she
continued
with
her
natural
gayety
forget
me
ye
happy
lovers
lull
yourselves
in
the
sweet
enjoyment
of
nameless
ecstasies
i
go
to
watch
the
spies
and
especially
your
husband
lest
he
break
in
upon
you
without
notice
and
julia
suddenly
left
the
room
shutting
the
door
upon
anna
leopoldowna
and
her
lover
the
polish
count
lynar
no
love
prince
ulrich
of
brunswick
the
husband
of
the
regent
had
assembled
the
officers
of
his
general
staff
for
a
secret
conference
their
dark
threatening
glances
were
prophetic
of
mischief
and
angrily
flashed
the
eyes
of
the
prince
who
standing
in
their
midst
had
spoken
to
them
in
glowing
words
of
his
domestic
unhappiness
and
of
the
idle
dreamy
and
amatory
indolence
into
which
the
regent
had
fallen
she
writes
amorous
complainings
he
now
said
with
a
voice
of
rage
in
closing
his
long
speech
she
writes
sonnets
to
her
lover
instead
of
governing
and
reading
the
petitions
reports
and
other
documents
that
come
to
her
from
the
different
ministries
and
bureaus
which
she
constantly
returns
unread
you
are
men
and
are
you
willing
to
bear
the
humiliation
of
being
governed
by
a
woman
who
dishonors
you
by
disregarding
her
first
and
holiest
duties
and
setting
before
your
wives
and
daughters
the
shameful
example
of
a
criminal
love
thus
disgracing
her
own
son
your
emperor
and
master
no
no
we
will
not
bear
it
cried
the
wildly
excited
men
grasping
the
hilts
of
their
swords
give
us
proof
of
her
unfaithfulness
and
we
shall
know
how
to
act
as
becomes
men
over
whom
an
adulterous
woman
would
reign
it
is
an
unnatural
and
unendurable
law
that
commands
man
to
obey
a
woman
it
is
contrary
to
nature
that
the
mother
should
rule
in
the
name
of
her
son
when
the
father
is
living
the
father
whom
nature
and
universal
custom
acknowledge
as
the
lord
and
head
of
his
wife
and
children
cried
the
prince
give
us
proof
of
her
guilt
cried
the
soldiers
and
we
will
this
very
hour
proclaim
you
regent
in
her
stead
a
confidential
servant
of
the
prince
who
entered
at
this
moment
now
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
the
prince
s
face
flamed
up
well
then
gentleman
said
he
straightening
himself
up
you
demand
proof
in
this
very
hour
will
i
furnish
it
to
you
but
i
do
it
upon
one
condition
no
personal
violence
in
the
person
of
your
present
regent
you
must
respect
the
mother
of
your
emperor
the
wife
of
your
future
regent
anna
will
yield
to
our
just
representations
and
voluntarily
sign
the
act
of
abdication
in
my
favor
that
is
all
we
ought
to
demand
of
her
she
will
retain
her
sacred
and
inviolable
rights
as
the
wife
of
your
regent
as
the
mother
of
your
emperor
forget
not
that
first
of
all
give
us
the
proof
of
her
guilt
impatiently
cried
the
men
i
shall
alas
be
able
to
give
it
you
said
the
prince
with
dignity
far
be
it
from
me
to
desire
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
person
believe
me
nothing
but
her
guilt
could
induce
me
to
take
action
against
her
were
she
innocent
i
would
be
the
first
to
kneel
and
renew
to
her
my
oath
of
fidelity
and
obedience
but
you
can
not
desire
that
i
your
generalissimo
should
be
the
subject
of
a
wife
who
shamefully
treads
under
foot
her
first
and
holiest
duty
the
honor
of
you
all
is
wounded
in
mine
come
follow
me
now
i
will
show
you
count
lynar
in
the
arms
of
his
mistress
the
regent
anna
leopoldowna
the
prince
strode
forth
cautiously
followed
by
his
generals
they
thus
passed
noiselessly
through
the
long
corridor
leading
from
the
wing
of
the
palace
inhabited
by
the
prince
to
that
occupied
by
the
regent
in
the
boudoir
of
the
regent
anna
a
somewhat
singular
scene
was
now
presented
the
tender
caresses
of
the
lovers
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
julia
von
mengden
who
slipped
in
through
the
secret

in
a
white
satin
robe
and
with
a
myrtle
crown
upon
her
head
princess

for
you
to
know

she
hurriedly
said
your
husband

now
coming
here
through
the
corridor
with
his
generals
they
hope
to
surprise
you
in
your
lover
s
arms
that
they
may
have
an
excuse
for
deposing
you
from
the
regency
and
substituting
your
husband
struggle
against
struggle
we
will
outwit
them
and
cure
your
husband
of
his
jealousy
from
this
hour
he
shall
be
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
mistaken
and
that
it
is
for
him
to
implore
your
pardon
anna
leopoldowna

each
other
s
shoulders
upon
this
singular
and
unexpected
spectacle
at
length
a
murmur
arose
they
pressed
farther
forward
toward
the
door
and
overcoming
his
momentary
stupefaction
the
prince
ventured
into
the
room
an
angry
glance
of
the
priest
commanded
silence
with
a
louder
voice
he
continued
his
prayer
anna
leopoldowna
smilingly
beckoned
her
husband
to
her
side
and
slightly
nodded
to
the
generals
they
bowed
to
the
ground
before
their
august
mistress
the
regent
now
came
the
closing
prayer
and
the
dispensation
of
the
blessing
the
priest
pronounced
it
kneeling
the
regent
also
bent
the
knee
and
drew
the
prince
down
beside
her
following
the
example
of
the
generalissimo
the
other
generals
also
sank
upon
their
knees
it
was
a
general
prayer
which
no
one
dared
disturb
the
ceremony
was
ended
the
priest
kissed
and
blessed
the
bridal
pair
and
then
departed
with
his
assistants
he
was
followed
by
the
servants
of
the
favorite
anna
now
turned
with
a
proud
smile
to
the
prince
accident
my
husband
has
made
you
a
witness
of
this
marriage
said
she
may
i
ask
your
highness
what
procures
me
this
unexpected
and
somewhat
intrusive
visit
and
why
my
generals
unannounced
accompany
you
to
their
regent
and
mistress
the
embarrassed
prince
stammered
some
unintelligible
words
to
which
anna
paid
no
attention
stepping
forward
she
motioned
the
generals
to
enter
and
with
her
most
fascinating
smile
said
ah
i
think
i
now
know
the
reason
of
your
coming
gentlemen
your
loyal
and
faithful
hearts
yearn
for
a
sight
of
your
young
emperor
it
is
true
his
faithful
subjects
have
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
even
a
sovereign
is
not
guaranteed
against
the
evil
influences
of
the
weather
which
has
lately
been
very
rough
and
for
that
reason
the
young
czar
has
been
unable
to
show
himself
to
his
people
ah
it
pleases
me
that
you
have
come
and
i
am
obliged
to
my
husband
for
bringing
you
to
me
so
unexpectedly
you
may
now
satisfy
yourselves
that
the
emperor
lives
and
is
growing
fast
julia
bring
us
the
young
emperor
julia
von
mengden
silently
departed
while
count
lynar
respectfully
approaching
the
regent
said
a
few
words
to
her
in
a
low
tone
you
are
quite
right
sir
count
said
the
regent
aloud
and
turning
to
her
husband
and
the
generals
continued
count
lynar
is
in
some
trouble
about
the
unexpected
publicity
given
to
his
marriage
there
are
however
important
reasons
for
keeping
it
still
a
secret
the
family
of
my
maid
of
honor
are
opposed
to
this
alliance
with
the
foreigner
and
insist
that
julia
shall
marry
another
whom
they
have
destined
for
her
on
the
other
hand
certain
family
considerations
render
secrecy
the
duty
of
the
count
julia
oppressed
by
her
inexorable
relations
disclosed
the
state
of
affairs
to
me
and
as
i
love
julia
and
as
i
saw
that
she
was
wasting
away
with
grief
without
the
possession
of
her
lover
i
favored
her
connection
with
count
lynar
they
daily
saw
each
other
in
my
apartments
and
finally
yielding
to
their
united
prayers
i
consented
that
they
should
this
day
be
legally
united
by
the
priest
and
thus
defeat
the
opposition
of
their
respective
families
this
gentlemen
continued
anna
raising
her
voice
is
the
simple
explanation
of
this
mystery
i
owe
this
explanation
to
myself
well
knowing
that
secret
slander
and
malicious
insinuations
might
seek
to
implicate
me
in
this
affair
and
that
a
certain
inimical
and
party
displeased
that
you
should
have
a
woman
for
regent
would
be
glad
to
prove
to
you
that
all
women
are
weak
faulty
and
sinful
creatures
be
careful
how
you
credit
such
miserable
tales
silent
with
downcast
eyes
stood
the
generals
under
the
flashing
glance
of
the
regent
who
now
turned
to
her
husband
with
a
mocking
smile
you
my
prince
and
husband
said
she
you
i
have
to
thank
your
tenderness
of
heart
induced
you
generously
to
furnish
me
with
this
opportunity
to
justify
my
conduct
to
my
most
distinguished
and
subjects
and
servants
and
thus
to
break
the
point
of
the
weapon
with
which
calumny
threatened
my
breast
i
therefore
thank
you
my
husband
but
see
there
comes
the
in
fact
the
were
at
this
moment
thrown
open
and
a
long
train
of
palace
officials
and
servants
approached
at
the
head
of
the
train
was
julia
von
mengden
bearing
a
velvet
cushion
bespangled
with
brilliants
upon
which
reposed
the
child
in
a
dress
of
gold
brocade
on
both
sides
were
seen
the
richly
adorned
nurses
and
attendants
and
near
them
the
bearing
upon
a
golden
cushion
the
imperial
crown
and
other
insignia
of
empire
anna
leopoldowna
took
young
ivan
in
her
arms
the
child
smiled
in
her
face
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
the
sparkling
crown
with
her
son
upon
her
arm
anna
majestically
advanced
to
the
centre
of
the
hall
and
lifting
up
the
child
said
behold
your
emperor
respect
and
reverence
for
your
illustrious
master
upon
your
knees
in
the
presence
of
your
emperor
it
was
as
if
all
servants
attendants
and
generals
had
been
struck
with
a
magic
wand
they
all
fell
upon
their
knees
and
bowed
their
heads
to
the
earth
venal
slaves
one
word
from
their
ruler
sufficed
to
set
them
all
grovelling
in
the
dust
with
a
proud
smile
anna
enjoyed
this
triumph
near
her
stood
the
prince
the
father
of
the
emperor
with
rage
and
shame
in
his
heart
long
live
the
emperor
resounded
from
all
lips
and
the
child
ivan
emperor
of
all
the
russias
screeched
for
joy
at
the
noise
and
at
the
splendor
of
the
assemblage
long
live
our
noble
regent
anna
leopoldowna
now
loudly
cried
julia
von
mengden
like
a
thundering
cry
of
jubilation
it
was
instantly
echoed
through
the
hall
the
generals
were
the
first
to
join
in
this
enthusiastic
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
generals
were
permitted
to
retire
and
the
emperor
was
reconveyed
to
his
apartments
anna
leopoldowna
remained
alone
with
her
husband
and
the
pair
who
had
retreated
to
the
recess
of
a
window
and
were
whispering
together
anna
now
turned
to
her
husband
and
with
cutting
coldness
in
her
tone
said
you
must
understand
my
husband
that
i
am
very
generous
it
was
in
my
power
to
arrest
you
as
a
traitor
but
i
preferred
to
shame
you
because
you
unhappily
are
the
father
of
my
you
think
then
asked
the
prince
with
a
scornful
smile
that
i
shall
take
the
buffoonery
you
have
just
had
played
before
us
for
truth
that
my
prince
must
wholly
depend
upon
your
own
good
pleasure
but
for
the
present
i
must
request
you
to
retire
to
your
own
apartments
i
feel
myself
much
moved
and
exhausted
and
have
also
to
prepare
some
secret
dispatches
for
count
lynar
to
take
with
him
in
his
count
lynar
is
then
to
leave
us
quickly
asked
the
prince
in
an
evidently
more
friendly
tone
yes
said
anna
he
leaves
us
for
some
weeks
to
visit
the
estate
in
liefland
which
i
have
given
to
julia
as
a
bridal
present
and
to
make
there
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
proper
reception
of
his
julia
clasped
the
hands
of
her
mistress
and
bathed
them
with
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
anna
whispered
prince
ulrich
i
did
you
wrong
pardon
anna
coldly
responded
i
will
pardon
you
if
you
will
be
generous
enough
to
allow
me
a
little
the
prince
silently
and
respectfully
withdrew
anna
finally
left
alone
with
her
lover
and
her
favorite
sank
exhausted
upon
a
divan
close
the
doors
julia
that
no
one
may
surprise
us
she
faintly
murmured
i
will
take
leave
oh
i
would
be
left
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
undisturbed
in
my
then
it
is
quite
true
that
you
intend
to
drive
me
away
asked
count
lynar
kneeling
and
clasping
her
hands
you
are
determined
to
send
me
into
banishment
anna
gave
him
a
glance
of
tenderness
no
said
she
i
will
send
myself
into
banishment
for
i
shall
not
see
you
dearest
but
i
felt
that
this
sacrifice
was
necessary
julia
has
sacrificed
herself
for
us
with
another
love
in
her
heart
she
has
magnanimously
thrown
away
her
freedom
and
given
up
her
maiden
love
for
the
promotion
of
our
happiness
we
owe
it
to
her
to
preserve
her
honor
untarnished
that
the
calumnious
crowd
may
not
pry
into
the
motives
of
her
generous
act
for
julia
s
sake
the
world
must
and
shall
believe
that
she
is
in
fact
your
wife
and
that
it
was
love
that
united
you
we
must
therefore
preserve
appearances
and
you
must
conduct
your
wife
to
your
estate
in
triumph
decency
requires
it
and
we
can
not
disregard
its
princess
anna
is
in
the
right
said
julia
you
must
absent
yourself
for
a
few
weeks
not
for
my
sake
who
little
desire
any
such
triumph
but
that
the
world
may
believe
the
tale
and
no
longer
suspect
my
it
was
a
sweetly
painful
hour
a
farewell
so
tearful
and
yet
so
full
of
happiness
on
that
very
night
was
the
count
to
commence
his
journey
to
liefland
and
warsaw
as
they
wished
to
make
no
secret
of
the
marriage
the
count
needed
the
consent
of
his
court
and
his
family
anna
provided
him
with
letters
and
passports
the
best
and
fairest
of
the
estates
of
the
crown
in
liefland
was
assigned
to
julia
as
a
bridal
present
and
the
count
was
furnished
with
the
proper
documents
to
enable
him
to
take
possession
of
it
and
finally
came
the
parting
moment
for
the
last
time
they
lay
in
each
other
s
arms
they
mutually
swore
eternal
love
unconquerable
fidelity
all
that
a
loving
couple
could
swear
tearing
himself
from
her
embrace
he
rushed
to
the
door
anna
stretches
out
her
arms
toward
him
her
brow
is
pallid
her
eyes
fixed
the
door
opens
he
turns
for
one
last
look
and
nods
a
farewell
ah
with
her
last
glance
she
would
forever
enchain
that
noble
and
beautiful
face
with
her
extended
arms
she
would
forever
retain
that
majestic
form
farewell
anna
farewell
the
door
closes
behind
him
he
is
gone
a
cold
shudder
convulsed
anna
s
form
a
bodeful
fear
took
possession
of
her
mind
it
lay
upon
her
heart
like
a
dark
i
shall
never
never
see
him
again
she
shrieked
sinking
unconscious
into
julia
s
arms
princess
elizabeth
while
a
mecklenburg
princess
had
attained
to
the
regency
of
russia
and
while
her
son
was
hailed
as
emperor
the
princess
elizabeth
lived
alone
and
unnoticed
in
her
small
and
throne
and
yet
in
petersburg
was
living
the
only
rightful
heir
to
the
empire
the
daughter
of
czar
peter
the
great
and
as
she
was
young
beautiful
and
amiable
how
came
she
to
be
set
aside
to
make
room
for
a
stranger
upon
the
throne
of
her
father
which
belonged
to
her
alone
princess
elizabeth
had
voluntarily
kept
aloof
from
all
political
intrigues
and
all
revolutions
in
the
interior
of
her
palace
she
passed
happy
days
her
world
her
life
and
her
pleasures
were
there
princess
elizabeth
desired
not
to
reign
her
only
wish
was
to
love
and
be
loved
the
intoxicating
splendor
of
worldly
greatness
was
not
so
inviting
to
her
as
the
more
intoxicating
pleasure
of
blessed
and
happy
love
she
would
above
all
things
be
a
woman
and
enjoy
the
full
possession
of
her
youth
and
happiness
what
cared
she
that
her
own
rightful
throne
was
occupied
by
a
stranger
what
cared
she
for
the
blinding
shimmer
of
a
crown
ah
it
troubled
her
not
that
she
was
poor
and
possessed
not
even
the
means
of
bestowing
presents
upon
her
favorites
and
friends
but
she
felt
happy
in
her
poverty
for
she
was
free
to
love
whom
she
would
to
raise
to
herself
whomsoever
she
might
please
it
was
a
festival
day
that
they
were
celebrating
in
the
humble
palace
of
the
emperor
s
daughter
elizabeth
certainly
a
festival
day
for
it
was
the
of
the
princess
the
rooms
were
adorned
with
festoons
and
garlands
and
all
her
dependants
and
friends
were
gathered
around
her
elizabeth
saw
not
the
limited
number
of
this
band
she
enjoyed
herself
with
those
who
were
there
and
lamented
not
the
much
greater
number
of
those
who
had
forgotten
her
she
was
among
her
friends
in
her
little
evening
had
come
the
household
and
the
less
trusted
and
favored
of
her
adherents
had
withdrawn
and
only
the
most
intimate
most
favored
friends
now
remained
with
the
princess
they
had
conversed
so
long
that
they
now
recurred
to
the
enjoyment
of
that
art
music
a
young
man
sang
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
guitar
elizabeth
listened
listlessly
reclining
upon
her
divan
behind
her
stood
two
gentlemen
who
like
her
were
delightedly
listening
to
the
singing
of
the
youth
elizabeth
was
a
blooming
beautiful
woman
she
was
charming
to
the
eye
in
the
robe
embroidered
with
silver
that
enveloped
her
full
voluptuous
form
leaving
her
neck
and
free
and
displaying
the
delicate
whiteness
of
her
skin
in
beautiful
contrast
with
the
purple
of
her
robe
perhaps
a
severe
judge
might
not
have
pronounced
her
face
handsome
according
to
the
rules
of
the
antique
but
it
was
one
of
those
faces
that
please
and
bewitch
the
other
sex
one
of
those
beauties
whose
charm
consists
not
so
much
in
the
regularity
of
the
lines
as
in
the
expression
there
was
so
much
that
was
winning
enticing
supercilious
and
in
the
face
of
this
woman
the
full
swelling
lips
how
charming
were
they
when
she
smiled
those
dark
sparkling
eyes
how
seducing
were
they
when
shaded
by
a
soft
veil
of
emotional
enthusiasm
those
cheeks
that
heaving
bosom
that
voluptuous
form
yet
resplendent
with
youthful
gayety
for
elizabeth
had
not
yet
reached
her
thirtieth
year
whom
would
she
not
have
animated
excited
transported
elizabeth
knew
she
was
beautiful
and
attractive
and
this
was
her
pride
and
her
joy
she
could
easily
pardon
the
german
princess
anna
leopoldowna
for
occupying
the
throne
that
was
rightfully
her
own
but
she
would
never
have
forgiven
the
regent
had
she
been
handsomer
than
herself
anna
leopoldowna
was
the
most
powerful
woman
in
russia
but
she
elizabeth
was
the
handsomest
woman
in
russia
which
was
all
she
coveted
and
she
had
nothing
more
to
desire
but
at
this
moment
she
thought
neither
of
anna
leopoldowna
nor
of
her
own
beauty
but
only
of
the
singer
who
was
warbling
to
her
those
russian
popular
songs
so
full
of
love
and
sadness
that
they
bring
tears
into
the
eyes
and
fill
the
heart
with
yearning
elizabeth
had
forgotten
all
around
her
she
heard
only
him
saw
only
him
her
whole
soul
lay
in
the
glances
with
which
she
observed
him
and
around
her
mouth
played
one
of
those
bewitching
smiles
peculiar
to
her
in
moments
of
joy
and
satisfaction
and
which
her
courtiers
knew
and
observed
he
was
very
handsome
this
young
singer
and
as
elizabeth
saw
him
in
this
moment
she
congratulated
herself
that
her
had
quickly
remarked
him
when
some
weeks
previously
she
had
first
seen
him
as
the
precentor
of
the
imperial
chapel
surprised
and
excited
by
the
beauty
of
his
form
and
the
sweetness
of
his
voice
elizabeth
had
begged
him
of
the
for
her
private
service
and
since
then
alexis
razumovsky
had
entered
her
house
as
her
private
secretary
and
the
manager
of
her
small
estate
while
alexis
was
singing
with
his
tones
elizabeth
turned
her
swimming
eyes
to
the
two
men
who
were
standing
in
respectful
silence
behind
her
you
must
acknowledge
said
she
in
a
low
tone
and
as
if
oppressed
by
internal
commotion
that
you
never
saw
nor
heard
say
any
thing
finer
than
my
oh
yes
said
one
of
these
men
with
a
low
bow
we
have
seen
and
did
we
not
yesterday
hear
you
sing
this
same
charming
princess
asked
the
other
elizabeth
smiled
it
is
already
well
known
that
woronzow
and
grunstein
must
always
flatter
said
she
no
we
do
not
flatter
responded
woronzow
the
chamberlain
of
the
princess
we
only
love
truth
you
ask
if
we
have
ever
seen
any
thing
more
beautiful
than
your
private
secretary
and
we
answer
that
we
have
seen
well
now
you
have
all
so
often
assured
me
that
i
am
the
handsomest
woman
in
russia
that
at
length
i
am
compelled
to
believe
you
but
alexis
is
fortunately
a
man
and
therefore
not
my
rival
you
may
then
fearlessly
confess
that
alexis
is
the
handsomest
of
all
men
but
how
is
this
exclaimed
the
princess
interrupting
herself
as
the
handsome
young
singer
suddenly
sprang
up
and
threw
his
guitar
aside
with
an
indignant
movement
do
you
sing
no
more
alexis
no
frowardly
responded
the
young
man
i
sing
no
more
when
my
princess
no
longer
listens
there
see
the
ungrateful
man
said
the
princess
with
a
charming
smile
he
was
occupying
all
my
thoughts
and
yet
he
dares
complain
you
are
a
malefactor
deserving
punishment
come
here
to
me
alexis
kneel
kiss
my
hand
and
beg
for
pardon
you
calumniator
that
is
a
punishment
for
which
angels
might
be
grateful
responded
alexis
razumovsky
kneeling
to
the
princess
and
pressing
her
hand
to
his
burning
lips
ah
that
i
might
oftener
incur
such
punishment
do
you
then
prefer
punishment
to
reward
asked
elizabeth
tenderly
bending
down
to
him
and
looking
deep
into
his
eyes
she
loves
him
whispered
grunstein
to
the
chamberlain
woronzow
she
certainly
loves
him
elizabeth
s
fine
ear
caught
these
words
and
slowly
turning
her
head
she
slightly
nodded
yes
said
she
grunstein
is
right
she
loves
him
congratulate
me
therefore
my
friends
that
the
desert
void
in
my
heart
is
at
length
filled
congratulate
me
for
loving
him
ah
nothing
is
sweeter
holier
or
more
precious
than
love
and
i
can
tell
you
that
we
women
are
happy
only
when
we
are
under
the
influence
of
that
divine
passion
congratulate
me
then
my
friends
for
thank
god
i
am
in
love
now
alexis
what
have
you
to
say
there
are
no
words
to
express
such
a
happiness
cried
alexis
pressing
the
feet
of
the
princess
to
his
bosom
happiness
then
strikes
you
dumb
laughed
the
princess
and
will
not
allow
you
to
say
that
you
love
me
such
are
all
you
men
you
envelope
yourselves
with
a
convenient
silence
and
would
make
us
poor
women
believe
the
superabundance
of
feeling
deprives
you
of
at
this
moment
the
door
was
softly
opened
and
a
lackey
who
made
his
appearance
at
the
threshold
beckoned
to
woronzow
what
is
it
woronzow
asked
the
princess
while
wholly
unembarrassed
by
the
presence
of
the
lackey
she
played
with
the
profuse
dark
locks
of
the
kneeling
razumovsky
an
invitation
from
the
regent
anna
to
a
which
is
to
take
place
fourteen
days
hence
said
woronzow
ah
our
good
cousin
is
then
so
gracious
as
to
remember
us
cried
the
princess
with
a
somewhat
clouded
brow
it
will
certainly
be
a
very
magnificent
festival
as
we
are
invited
so
many
days
in
advance
how
sad
that
i
can
not
have
the
pleasure
of
being
present
and
why
not
if
one
may
be
allowed
to
ask
princess
asked
woronzow
why
sighed
elizabeth
ask
my
she
will
tell
you
that
the
princess
elizabeth
daughter
of
the
great
czar
peter
has
not
one
single
robe
splendid
enough
to
render
her
presentable
without
mortification
at
a
of
the
whatever
robe
you
may
wear
passionately
interposed
alexis
you
will
still
be
resplendent
for
your
beauty
will
impart
a
divine
halo
to
any
dress
that
was
precisely
the
kind
of
flattery
pleasing
to
elizabeth
think
you
so
flatterer
asked
elizabeth
well
for
once
i
will
believe
your
words
and
assume
that
the
princess
elizabeth
may
be
fair
without
the
aid
of
splendor
in
dress
we
therefore
accept
the
invitation
woronzow
announce
that
to
the
regent
s
messenger
but
still
it
is
sad
and
humiliating
continued
elizabeth
after
a
pause
a
cloud
passing
over
her
usually
so
cheerful
countenance
yes
it
is
still
a
melancholy
circumstance
for
the
daughter
of
the
great
peter
to
be
so
poor
that
she
is
not
able
to
dress
herself
suitably
to
her
rank
ah
how
humiliating
is
the
elevation
of
my
high
position
when
i
can
not
even
properly
reward
you
my
friends
for
your
fidelity
and
attachment
you
will
one
day
be
able
to
reward
us
significantly
remarked
grunstein
one
day
when
an
imperial
crown
surmounts
your
fair
brows
then
will
your
generous
heart
be
able
to
act
according
to
its
noble
still
the
same
old
dreams
said
elizabeth
shaking
her
head
and
letting
razumovsky
s
long
locks
glide
through
her
fingers
pay
no
attention
to
him
alexis
he
is
an
enthusiast
who
dreams
of
imperial
crowns
while
i
desire
nothing
but
a
that
in
it
i
may
please
you
my
friend
oh
you
always
please
me
whispered
alexis
and
most
pleasing
are
you
when
the
conclusion
of
his
flattering
speech
he
whispered
so
low
that
it
was
heard
by
no
one
but
the
princess
patting
his
cheek
with
her
little
round
hand
she
blushed
but
not
for
shame
as
she
did
not
cast
down
her
eyes
but
answered
with
a
glowing
glance
the
tender
looks
of
her
lover
she
blushed
only
from
an
internal
passionate
excitement
while
her
bosom
stormily
rose
and
fell
you
are
very
saucy
alexis
said
she
but
at
the
same
time
lightly
kissing
him
upon
the
forehead
and
smiling
but
then
her
brow
was
suddenly
clouded
for
the
door
was
again
opened
and
once
more
the
lackey
appeared
upon
the
threshold
the
french
ambassador
said
he
the
marquis
de
la
chetardie
begs
the
favor
of
an
ah
the
good
marquis
cried
the
princess
rising
from
her
reclining
position
conduct
him
in
he
is
very
the
lackey
opened
both
wings
of
the
and
the
marquis
entered
followed
by
several
servants
with
boxes
and
packets
ah
you
come
very
much
like
a
milliner
laughingly
exclaimed
elizabeth
graciously
advancing
to
receive
the
ambassador
dropping
upon
one
knee
the
marquis
kissed
her
offered
hand
i
come
illustrious
princess
elizabeth
to
beg
a
favor
of
you
he
said
you
wish
to
mortify
me
responded
elizabeth
how
can
the
ambassador
of
a
great
and
powerful
nation
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
the
poor
repudiated
and
forgotten
princess
elizabeth
in
the
name
of
the
king
my
master
come
i
to
demand
this
favor
solemnly
answered
the
marquis
well
if
you
really
speak
in
earnest
said
the
princess
then
i
have
only
to
respond
that
it
will
make
me
very
happy
to
comply
with
any
request
which
your
august
king
or
yourself
may
have
to
make
of
then
i
may
be
allowed
on
this
occasion
of
the
celebration
of
your
to
lay
at
your
feet
these
trifling
presents
of
my
royal
master
said
the
ambassador
of
france
rising
to
take
the
boxes
and
packages
from
the
lackeys
and
place
them
before
elizabeth
they
are
only
trifles
continued
he
while
assiduously
occupied
in
opening
the
boxes
trifles
of
little
value
only
interesting
perhaps
because
they
are
novelties
that
have
as
yet
been
worn
in
paris
by
no
lady
except
the
queen
and
madame
this
mantelet
of
valenciennes
lace
continued
the
busy
marquis
unfolding
before
the
princess
a
magically
fine
lace
texture
this
mantelet
is
sent
by
the
queen
of
france
to
the
illustrious
princess
elizabeth
only
two
such
mantelets
have
been
made
and
her
majesty
has
strictly
commanded
that
no
more
of
a
similar
pattern
shall
be
princess
elizabeth
s
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
like
a
curious
child
she
fluttered
from
one
box
to
the
other
and
in
fact
they
were
very
costly
tasteful
and
charming
things
which
their
majesties
of
france
had
sent
to
the
princess
elizabeth
who
prized
nothing
higher
than
splendor
in
dress
and
ornaments
there
were
the
most
beautiful
velvet
robes
light
crape
and
lace
dresses
and
hats
and
topknots
of
charming
elegance
elizabeth
examined
and
admired
all
she
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
when
any
one
of
these
precious
presents
especially
pleased
her
calling
alexis
grunstein
and
woronzow
to
share
her
joy
and
admiration
now
it
will
be
a
triumph
for
me
to
appear
at
this
ball
said
elizabeth
exultingly
ah
how
beautiful
it
is
of
your
king
that
he
has
sent
me
these
magnificent
presents
and
not
eight
days
later
i
shall
excite
the
envy
of
the
regent
and
all
the
court
ladies
with
these
charming
things
which
no
one
besides
myself
will
and
the
princess
was
constantly
renewing
her
examination
of
the
presents
and
breaking
out
into
ecstasies
over
their
beauty
the
marquis
de
la
chetardie
smilingly
listened
to
her
told
her
much
about
paris
and
its
splendors
declaring
that
even
in
paris
there
was
no
lady
who
could
be
compared
to
the
fair
princess
elizabeth
ah
remarked
elizabeth
smilingly
threatening
him
with
her
finger
you
would
speak
differently
if
the
queen
or
some
other
lady
of
your
court
were
standing
by
my
side
no
seriously
replied
the
marquis
i
would
fall
at
the
feet
of
my
queen
and
say
you
are
my
queen
judge
me
condemn
me
my
life
is
in
your
hand
you
are
the
queen
of
france
and
as
such
i
bend
before
you
but
princess
elizabeth
is
the
queen
of
beauty
and
as
such
i
adore
her
princess
elizabeth
smiled
and
with
harmless
unconstraint
chatted
yet
a
long
time
with
the
shrewd
and
versatile
ambassador
of
the
french
king
i
have
yet
one
more
request
to
make
said
the
marquis
when
about
to
take
leave
but
it
is
a
request
that
no
one
but
yourself
must
hear
princess
elizabeth
signed
to
her
friends
to
withdraw
into
the
open
anteroom
well
marquis
she
then
said
with
some
curiosity
let
me
now
hear
what
else
you
have
to
my
king
and
master
has
learned
with
regret
that
the
noble
princess
elizabeth
is
not
surrounded
with
that
wealth
and
splendor
which
is
her
due
as
the
daughter
of
the
great
emperor
and
the
rightful
heir
to
the
russian
throne
my
king
begs
the
favor
of
being
allowed
to
make
good
the
delinquency
toward
you
of
the
present
russian
regency
and
that
he
may
have
the
pleasure
of
providing
you
with
the
means
necessary
to
enable
you
to
establish
a
court
suitable
to
your
birth
and
position
i
am
provided
with
sufficient
funds
for
these
purposes
you
have
only
to
send
me
by
your
physician
in
ordinary
lestocq
a
quittance
signed
by
you
and
any
sum
you
may
require
will
be
immediately
paid
oh
said
the
princess
with
emotion
i
shall
never
be
able
sufficiently
to
testify
my
gratitude
to
the
generous
king
of
france
i
am
a
poor
insignificant
woman
who
can
thankfully
accept
but
never
requite
his
who
knows
said
the
marquis
significantly
you
may
one
day
become
the
most
powerful
woman
in
europe
for
your
birth
and
your
destiny
call
you
to
the
oh
i
know
you
are
lestocq
s
friend
and
share
his
dreams
said
the
princess
but
let
us
not
now
speak
of
impossibilities
nor
idly
jest
while
i
am
deeply
touched
by
the
generous
friendship
of
your
sovereign
that
i
accept
his
offer
may
prove
to
him
and
you
how
much
i
love
and
respect
him
for
we
willingly
incur
obligations
only
to
those
who
are
so
highly
estimated
that
we
gratefully
subordinate
ourselves
to
them
write
this
to
your
and
may
i
also
write
to
him
asked
the
marquis
that
this
conversation
will
remain
a
secret
of
which
above
all
things
the
regent
anna
leopoldowna
is
to
know
nothing
my
imperial
word
of
honor
said
the
princess
that
no
one
except
ourselves
and
lestocq
whom
you
yourself
propose
as
a
medium
shall
know
anything
of
this
great
generosity
of
your
sovereign
god
grant
that
a
time
may
one
day
come
when
i
may
loudly
and
publicly
acknowledge
my
great
obligations
to
him
that
time
will
have
come
when
you
are
empress
of
russia
said
the
ambassador
taking
his
leave
already
one
more
who
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
make
an
empress
of
me
said
the
princess
as
her
three
favorites
again
entered
foolish
people
that
you
are
it
does
not
satisfy
you
to
be
the
friend
of
a
princess
elizabeth
but
i
must
become
an
empress
for
your
how
well
the
diadem
would
become
that
proud
pure
brow
exclaimed
alexis
with
animation
how
happy
would
this
poor
russia
be
under
your
mild
sceptre
said
the
chamberlain
woronzow
yes
you
owe
it
to
all
of
us
to
yourself
and
your
people
to
mount
the
throne
of
your
fathers
said
grunstein
but
if
i
say
to
you
that
i
will
not
cried
the
princess
reclining
again
upon
her
divan
the
duties
of
an
empress
are
very
difficult
and
wearing
i
love
quiet
and
enjoyment
and
moreover
this
throne
of
my
father
of
which
you
speak
so
pathetically
is
already
occupied
and
awaits
me
not
see
you
not
your
sublime
emperor
ivan
whom
the
is
rocking
in
his
cradle
that
is
your
emperor
before
whom
you
can
bow
and
leave
me
unmolested
with
your
imperial
crown
come
alexis
sit
down
by
me
upon
this
tabouret
we
will
take
another
look
at
these
magnificent
presents
ah
truly
they
are
dearer
to
me
than
the
possession
of
the
princess
elizabeth
can
thus
speak
only
in
jest
said
an
earnest
voice
behind
them
ah
lestocq
said
the
princess
with
a
friendly
nod
you
come
very
late
my
and
yet
too
soon
to
bring
you
bad
news
said
lestocq
with
a
profound
and
respectful
bow
to
the
princess
bad
news
repeated
elizabeth
turning
pale
am
i
then
one
too
many
for
them
here
would
they
kill
me
or
send
me
in
exile
to
siberia
yet
worse
laconically
responded
lestocq
but
first
of
all
let
us
be
cautious
and
take
care
that
we
have
no
and
crossing
the
room
lestocq
closed
all
the
doors
and
carefully
looked
behind
the
window
curtains
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
concealed
there
now
princess
he
commenced
in
a
tone
of
solemnity
now
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
to
a
conspiracy
a
momentary
pause
followed
princess
elizabeth
silently
motioned
her
friends
to
be
seated
and
drew
her
favorite
alexis
nearer
to
her
lestocq
her
physician
and
confidant
with
a
solemn
countenance
took
a
place
opposite
her
we
are
ready
to
hear
your
bad
news
said
the
princess
the
regent
anna
leopoldowna
will
have
herself
crowned
as
empress
laconically
responded
lestocq
elizabeth
looked
at
him
interrogatively
and
with
curiosity
for
the
continuation
of
his
bad
news
but
as
lestocq
remained
silent
she
asked
with
astonishment
is
that
all
you
have
to
tell
us
preliminarily
that
is
all
answered
lestocq
princess
elizabeth
broke
out
with
a
joyous
laugh
well
this
is
in
fact
very
comic
with
a
real
job
s
mien
you
announce
to
us
the
worst
news
and
then
inform
us
that
anna
leopoldowna
is
to
be
crowned
empress
let
her
be
crowned
no
one
will
interfere
to
prevent
it
and
she
will
be
none
the
happier
for
it
no
woman
who
has
taken
possession
of
the
russian
throne
as
an
independent
princess
has
ever
yet
been
happy
or
do
you
think
that
catharine
my
lofty
was
so
believe
me
upon
the
throne
she
trembled
with
fear
of
assassins
for
it
is
well
known
that
this
russian
throne
is
surrounded
by
murderers
awaiting
only
the
favorable
moment
ah
whenever
i
have
stood
in
front
of
this
imperial
throne
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
the
points
of
a
thousand
daggers
peeping
forth
from
its
soft
cushions
and
you
would
have
me
seat
myself
upon
such
a
throne
no
no
leave
me
my
peace
and
repose
let
anna
leopoldowna
declare
herself
empress
what
should
i
care
i
should
have
to
bend
before
her
with
my
congratulations
that
is
all
and
the
princess
letting
her
head
glide
upon
razumovsky
s
shoulder
as
if
exhausted
by
this
long
speech
closed
her
fatigued
eyelids
ah
if
czar
peter
your
great
father
could
hear
you
sadly
said
lestocq
he
would
spurn
you
for
such
pusillanimity
it
is
therefore
fortunate
for
me
that
he
is
dead
said
the
princess
with
a
smile
and
now
my
dear
lestocq
if
you
know
nothing
further
let
this
suffice
you
i
tell
you
once
for
all
that
i
have
no
desire
for
this
imperial
throne
i
would
crown
my
head
with
roses
and
myrtles
but
not
with
that
golden
circle
which
would
crush
me
to
the
earth
therefore
trouble
me
no
more
on
this
subject
be
content
with
what
i
am
and
if
you
can
not
well
then
i
must
be
reconciled
to
being
abandoned
by
you
i
will
never
desert
you
even
if
i
must
follow
you
to
suffering
and
death
exclaimed
alexis
razumovsky
casting
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
princess
we
will
remain
true
and
faithful
to
you
unto
death
cried
woronzow
and
grunstein
well
and
you
alone
remain
silent
lestocq
asked
the
princess
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
have
not
yet
come
to
the
end
of
my
bad
news
said
lestocq
with
a
clouded
brow
ah
jestingly
interposed
the
princess
you
would
perhaps
as
further
bad
news
inform
us
that
the
emperor
ivan
has
cut
his
first
tooth
no
said
lestocq
i
would
only
say
to
you
that
the
of
december
the
day
on
which
the
regent
is
to
be
crowned
as
empress
the
of
december
is
the
day
assigned
for
the
marriage
of
princess
elizabeth
with
prince
louis
of
brunswick
the
new
duke
of
courland
the
princess
sprang
up
from
her
seat
as
if
stung
by
an
adder
alexis
razumovsky
who
still
knelt
at
her
feet
uttered
loud
lamentations
in
which
woronzow
and
grunstein
soon
joined
with
calm
triumph
lestocq
observed
the
effect
produced
by
his
words
what
are
you
saying
there
at
length
elizabeth
breathlessly
asked
i
say
that
on
the
of
december
the
princess
elizabeth
is
to
be
married
to
prince
louis
of
brunswick
who
has
already
come
to
petersburg
for
that
purpose
calmly
answered
lestocq
and
i
say
cried
the
princess
that
no
such
marriage
will
ever
take
place
lestocq
shrugged
his
shoulders
princess
elizabeth
is
a
gentle
always
suffering
lamb
he
said
but
princess
elizabeth
can
become
a
tigress
when
it
concerns
the
defence
of
her
holiest
rights
exclaimed
the
princess
pacing
the
room
in
violent
excitement
ah
she
continued
they
are
not
then
satisfied
with
delivering
me
over
to
poverty
and
abandonment
it
does
not
suffice
them
to
see
me
so
deeply
humiliated
as
to
receive
alms
from
this
regent
who
occupies
the
throne
that
belongs
to
me
they
would
rob
me
of
my
last
and
only
remaining
blessing
my
personal
freedom
they
would
make
my
poor
heart
a
prisoner
and
bind
it
with
the
chains
and
fetters
of
a
marriage
which
i
abhor
no
no
i
tell
you
that
shall
they
never
and
the
princess
quite
beside
herself
with
rage
stamped
her
feet
and
doubled
up
her
little
hands
into
fists
now
was
she
her
father
s
real
and
not
unworthy
daughter
czar
peter
s
bold
and
savage
spirit
flashed
from
her
eyes
his
scorn
and
courageous
determination
spoke
from
her
wildly
excited
features
she
saw
not
she
heard
not
what
was
passing
around
her
she
was
wholly
occupied
with
her
own
angry
thoughts
and
with
those
dreadful
images
which
the
mere
idea
of
marriage
had
conjured
up
her
four
favorites
stood
together
at
some
distance
observing
her
with
silent
sympathy
it
is
now
for
you
alexis
razumovsky
to
complete
the
work
we
have
begun
whispered
lestocq
to
him
elizabeth
loves
you
you
must
nourish
in
her
this
abhorrence
of
a
marriage
with
the
prince
you
must
make
yourself
so
loved
that
she
will
dare
all
rather
than
lose
you
we
have
long
enough
remained
in
a
state
of
abjectness
it
is
time
to
labor
for
our
advancement
to
the
work
to
the
work
alexis
razumovsky
we
must
make
an
empress
of
this
elizabeth
that
she
may
raise
us
to
wealth
and
dignities
rely
upon
me
whispered
alexis
she
must
and
shall
join
in
our
he
approached
the
princess
who
was
walking
the
room
in
a
state
of
the
most
violent
agitation
giving
vent
to
her
internal
excitement
and
anger
in
loud
exclamations
and
bitter
curses
i
must
therefore
die
sighed
alexis
pressing
elizabeth
s
trembling
hand
to
his
lips
kill
me
princess
thrust
a
dagger
in
my
heart
that
i
at
least
may
not
live
to
see
you
married
to
another
no
you
shall
not
die
cried
elizabeth
with
fierce
vehemence
throwing
her
arms
around
razumovsky
s
neck
i
will
know
how
to
defend
you
and
myself
alexis
ah
they
would
shackle
me
they
would
force
me
to
marry
because
they
know
i
hate
marriage
yes
i
hate
those
unnatural
fetters
which
could
command
my
heart
force
it
into
obedience
to
an
unnatural
law
and
degrade
divine
free
love
which
would
flutter
from
flower
to
flower
into
a
necessity
and
a
duty
it
is
an
unnatural
law
which
would
compel
us
forever
to
love
a
man
because
he
pleased
us
yesterday
or
may
please
us
and
who
perhaps
may
not
please
us
while
on
the
next
day
he
may
excite
only
repugnance
would
they
forge
these
matrimonial
chains
for
me
ah
regent
anna
you
are
this
time
mistaken
you
may
be
in
this
empire
but
you
can
not
and
shall
not
extend
that
power
over
me
and
how
asked
lestocq
shrugging
his
shoulders
how
will
princess
elizabeth
oppose
the
regent
or
empress
what
weapon
has
she
with
which
to
contend
if
it
must
be
so
i
will
oppose
power
to
power
passionately
exclaimed
the
princess
yes
when
it
comes
to
the
defence
of
my
freedom
and
my
personal
rights
i
will
then
have
the
courage
to
dare
all
defy
all
then
will
i
shake
off
the
lethargy
of
contented
mediocrity
and
upon
the
throne
will
find
that
freedom
which
anna
would
tread
under
foot
long
live
our
future
empress
long
live
elizabeth
cried
the
men
with
wild
excitement
i
have
long
withstood
you
my
friends
said
elizabeth
i
have
not
coveted
this
imperial
russian
crown
but
much
less
have
i
desired
that
crown
of
thorns
a
compulsory
marriage
i
am
now
ready
for
the
struggle
and
if
it
must
be
so
let
a
revolution
let
streams
of
blood
decide
whether
the
regent
anna
leopoldowna
or
the
daughter
of
peter
the
great
has
the
best
right
to
govern
this
land
and
prescribe
its
laws
ah
now
are
you
really
your
great
father
s
great
daughter
cried
lestocq
and
bending
a
knee
before
the
princess
he
continued
let
me
be
the
first
to
pay
you
homage
the
first
to
swear
eternal
fidelity
to
you
our
empress
receive
also
my
oath
empress
elizabeth
said
alexis
falling
upon
his
knees
before
her
receive
the
oaths
of
your
slaves
who
desire
nothing
but
to
devote
their
bodies
and
souls
to
your
service
let
me
also
do
homage
to
you
empress
elizabeth
exclaimed
woronzow
falling
to
the
earth
and
i
too
will
lie
at
your
feet
and
declare
myself
your
slave
empress
elizabeth
said
grunstein
kneeling
with
the
others
but
elizabeth
s
anger
was
already
past
only
a
momentary
had
lashed
her
gently
flowing
blood
into
the
high
foaming
waves
of
rage
now
all
again
was
calm
within
her
and
consequently
this
solemn
homage
scene
of
her
four
kneeling
friends
made
only
a
comic
impression
upon
her
she
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
astonished
and
half
angry
the
kneeling
men
looked
up
to
her
and
that
only
increased
her
hilarity
ah
this
is
infinitely
amusing
said
the
princess
continuing
to
laugh
there
lie
my
vassals
and
what
vassals
herr
lestocq
a
physician
herr
grunstein
a
bankrupt
shopkeeper
and
now
herr
woronzow
chamberlain
and
alexis
razumovsky
my
private
secretary
and
here
i
am
the
empress
of
such
vassals
and
what
sort
of
an
empress
an
empress
of
four
subjects
an
empress
without
a
throne
and
without
a
crown
without
land
and
without
a
people
an
empress
who
never
was
and
never
will
be
an
empress
and
in
this
solemn
buffoonery
you
cut
such
serious
faces
as
might
make
one
die
with
the
princess
threw
herself
upon
the
divan
and
laughed
until
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
princess
said
lestocq
rising
these
four
men
at
whom
you
now
laugh
will
make
you
empress
and
then
it
will
be
in
your
power
to
convert
this
chirurgeon
into
a
privy
councillor
and
court
physician
this
bankrupt
merchant
into
a
rich
banker
this
chamberlain
into
an
imperial
and
your
private
secretary
into
a
count
or
prince
of
the
the
eyes
of
the
princess
shone
yet
brighter
and
with
a
tender
glance
at
alexis
razumovsky
she
said
yes
i
will
make
him
a
prince
and
overload
him
with
presents
and
honors
ah
that
is
an
object
worth
the
pains
of
struggling
for
an
imperial
no
no
interposed
alexis
kissing
her
hand
i
need
neither
wealth
nor
titles
i
need
nothing
desire
nothing
but
to
be
near
you
to
be
able
to
breathe
the
air
that
has
fanned
your
cheek
i
desire
nothing
for
myself
but
everything
for
my
friends
here
with
whose
faithful
aid
we
shall
soon
be
enabled
to
greet
you
a
real
elizabeth
s
brow
beamed
with
the
purest
blessedness
you
are
as
unselfish
as
the
angels
in
heaven
my
alexis
said
she
it
suffices
you
that
i
am
elizabeth
you
languish
not
for
this
imperial
title
which
these
others
would
force
upon
alexis
smilingly
shook
his
fine
head
you
err
princess
said
he
i
would
freely
and
joyfully
give
my
heart
s
blood
could
i
this
day
but
salute
you
as
empress
i
should
then
at
least
have
no
more
to
fear
from
this
strange
prince
whom
they
would
compel
you
to
marry
a
cloud
passed
over
the
brow
of
the
princess
yes
you
are
right
said
she
we
must
avoid
that
at
all
events
and
if
there
are
no
other
means
very
well
i
shall
know
what
to
decide
upon
i
shall
venture
an
attempt
to
dethrone
the
regent
and
make
myself
empress
but
my
friends
let
that
now
suffice
i
need
rest
call
my
women
to
undress
me
woronzow
my
high
and
lofty
vassals
your
great
and
powerful
empress
allows
you
to
kiss
her
hand
with
a
pleasing
graciousness
she
extended
her
fair
hands
to
her
friends
who
respectfully
pressed
them
to
their
lips
and
then
departed
alexis
called
the
princess
as
razumovsky
was
about
to
withdraw
with
the
others
alexis
you
will
remain
awhile
while
my
women
are
undressing
me
you
shall
sing
me
to
sleep
with
that
charming
you
sing
so
splendidly
alexis
smiled
and
remained
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
deep
silence
prevailed
in
the
dark
palace
of
elizabeth
and
through
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
heard
only
the
voice
of
the
handsome
alexis
who
was
singing
his
to
the
princess
from
this
day
forward
her
four
trusted
friends
left
the
princess
no
peace
they
so
stormed
her
with
prayers
and
supplications
alexis
so
well
knew
how
to
represent
his
despair
at
her
approaching
and
unavoidable
marriage
that
the
amiable
princess
to
satisfy
her
friends
and
be
left
herself
at
peace
declared
herself
ready
to
sanction
the
plans
of
her
confidants
and
enter
into
a
conspiracy
against
the
regent
soon
a
small
party
was
formed
for
the
cause
of
the
princess
grunstein
who
as
the
princess
had
said
from
a
bankrupt
merchant
had
attained
the
position
of
subordinate
officer
grunstein
had
succeeded
in
winning
for
the
cause
of
the
princess
some
fifty
grenadiers
of
the
preobrajensky
regiment
to
which
he
belonged
and
these
people
drunkards
and
dissolute
fellows
were
the
principal
props
upon
which
elizabeth
s
throne
was
to
be
established
they
were
neither
particular
about
the
means
resorted
to
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
proposed
revolution
nor
careful
to
envelop
their
movements
in
secrecy
elizabeth
soon
began
to
find
pleasure
and
distraction
in
exciting
the
enthusiasm
of
the
soldiers
she
often
repaired
to
the
caserns
of
the
guards
and
her
mildness
and
affability
won
for
her
the
hearts
of
the
rough
soldiers
accustomed
to
slavish
subjection
when
she
rode
through
the
streets
it
was
not
an
unusual
occurrence
to
see
common
soldiers
approach
her
sledge
and
converse
familiarly
with
her
wherever
she
showed
herself
there
the
soldiers
received
her
with
shouts
and
the
palace
of
the
princess
was
always
open
to
them
in
this
way
elizabeth
made
herself
popular
and
the
regent
anna
who
was
informed
of
it
smiled
at
it
with
indifference
just
as
incautiously
did
elizabeth
s
fanatical
political
manager
lestocq
set
about
his
work
he
made
no
secret
of
his
intercourse
with
the
french
ambassador
and
in
the
public
he
was
often
heard
in
a
loud
voice
to
prophesy
an
approaching
political
change
but
with
regard
to
all
these
imprudences
it
seemed
as
if
the
court
and
the
regent
were
blinded
by
the
most
careless
confidence
as
if
they
could
not
see
what
was
directly
before
their
eyes
it
was
as
if
destiny
covered
those
eyes
with
a
veil
that
they
might
not
see
and
against
destiny
even
the
great
and
the
powerful
of
the
earth
struggle
in
vain
the
warning
the
of
december
the
day
of
the
to
which
elizabeth
had
looked
forward
with
a
longing
heart
because
of
her
anxiety
to
display
at
court
her
new
parisian
dresses
at
length
had
come
a
most
active
movement
prevailed
in
the
palace
of
the
regent
the
and
the
chamberlains
on
service
passed
up
and
down
through
the
rooms
overlooking
with
sharp
eyes
the
various
ornaments
festoons
garlands
and
draperies
to
make
sure
that
all
was
splendid
and
tasteful
and
magnificent
anna
leopoldowna
troubled
herself
very
little
about
these
busy
movements
in
her
palace
she
was
in
her
boudoir
delightedly
reading
a
letter
from
her
distant
lover
which
had
just
been
received
under
julia
s
address
she
had
already
read
this
letter
several
times
but
ever
recommenced
it
and
ever
found
some
new
word
some
new
phrase
that
proved
to
her
the
glowing
love
of
her
absent
friend
ah
he
still
loves
me
murmured
she
pressing
the
letter
to
her
lips
he
really
loves
me
and
this
short
separation
will
not
estrange
his
heart
but
cause
it
to
glow
with
warmer
passion
oh
what
a
happiness
will
it
be
when
he
again
returns
and
he
will
return
yes
he
will
be
with
me
again
on
the
of
december
and
animated
by
his
glances
i
shall
for
the
first
time
appear
in
all
the
splendor
of
an
imperial
crown
ah
they
have
no
presentiment
my
councillors
and
ministers
that
i
have
selected
the
of
december
for
the
ceremony
precisely
because
it
is
the
birthday
of
my
beloved
he
will
know
it
he
will
understand
why
his
anna
has
chosen
this
particular
day
and
he
will
thank
me
with
one
of
those
proud
and
glowing
glances
which
always
made
my
heart
tremulous
with
overpowering
happiness
oh
my
lynar
what
a
blessed
moment
will
be
that
when
i
see
you
again
a
slight
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
the
imaginings
of
the
princess
it
was
julia
von
mengden
who
came
to
announce
the
old
count
ostermann
and
is
it
for
him
that
you
disturb
my
delightful
solitude
asked
the
princess
somewhat
reproachfully
is
this
count
ostermann
is
this
whole
miserable
realm
of
so
much
importance
to
me
as
the
sweet
contemplation
of
a
letter
from
my
friend
when
i
am
reading
his
letter
it
seems
to
me
that
my
beloved
himself
is
at
my
side
and
therefore
you
must
clearly
see
that
i
can
not
receive
count
ostermann
as
lynar
is
with
me
put
your
letter
and
your
lover
in
your
bosom
said
julia
with
a
laugh
he
will
be
very
happy
there
and
then
you
can
receive
the
old
count
without
betraying
your
lover
s
presence
the
count
has
so
pressingly
begged
for
an
audience
that
i
finally
promised
to
intercede
with
you
for
ah
this
eternal
business
angrily
exclaimed
the
princess
they
will
never
let
me
have
any
peace
they
harass
me
the
whole
day
even
now
when
it
is
time
to
be
making
my
toilet
for
the
ball

then
send

count
ostermann
sulkily
asked
julia
that
i
may
consequently
for
the
whole
evening
see

with
a
dissatisfied
face
no
let
him
come
but
forget
not
that
i
submit
to
this
annoyance
only
to
please

a
grateful
smile
julia
kissed
the
regent
s
hand
and
then
hastened
to
bear
to
count
ostermann
the
favorable
answer
in
a
few
minutes
count
ostermann
painfully
supporting
himself
upon
two
crutches
entered
the
regent
s
cabinet
anna
leopoldowna
received
him
sitting
in
an
armchair
and
listlessly
rummaging
in
a
filled
with
various
articles
of
dress
and
embroidery
which
had
just
been
brought
to
her
well
said
she
raising
her
eyes
for
a
moment
to
glance
at
ostermann
you
come
at
a
very
inconvenient
hour
herr
minister
count
ostermann
you
see
that
i
am
already
occupied
with
my
toilet
and
am
endeavoring
to
find
a
suitable
will
you
aid
me
in
the
choice
sir
count
ostermann
had
until
now
painfully
and
with
many
suppressed
groans
sustained
himself
upon
his
feet
at
a
silent
nod
from
the
princess
he
glided
down
into
a
chair
and
staring
at
anna
with
his
piercing
and
eyes
he
said
you
highness
would
select
a
well
as
you
ask
my
advice
in
the
matter
i
will
give
it
choose
a
so
firm
and
solid
as
to
prove
a
fortification
for
the
defence
of
your
head
choose
a
that
will
protect
you
against
conspiracies
and
revolutions
against
false
friends
and
smiling
enemies
choose
a
that
will
keep
your
head
upon
your
shoulders
count
ostermann
speaks
in
riddles
said
anna
smiling
and
at
the
same
time
arranging
a
wreath
of
artificial
roses
or
no
it
was
not
count
ostermann
but
a
toad
singing
his
hoarse
song
drive
away
that
toad
ostermann
it
is
broad
day
why
then
have
we
the
croaking
of
such
listen
to
the
croaking
of
this
toad
anxiously
responded
the
old
man
believe
me
princess
when
the
toads
croak
in
broad
daylight
it
betokens
an
approaching
misfortune
let
it
warn
you
madame
regent
anna
you
have
called
me
a
toad
very
well
toads
always
have
correctly
prophesied
misfortune
and
if
they
can
never
avert
it
it
is
because
otherwise
people
will
not
listen
to
such
oracular
voices
of
nature
let
me
be
your
toad
your
highness
and
listen
to
me
i
foresee
misfortune
for
you
believe
my
prophecy
and
that
misfortune
may
yet
be
averted
mark
the
signs
by
which
fate
would
warn
you
did
you
not
yesterday
see
elizabeth
driving
through
the
streets
chatting
and
jesting
with
the
soldiers
who
crowded
around
her
sledge
have
you
not
heard
how
the
grenadiers
of
the
preobrajensky
regiment
shouted
after
her
has
it
not
been
told
you
that
lestocq
holds
secret
intercourse
with
the
french
ambassador
and
know
you
not
that
lestocq
is
the
confidential
servant
of
the
princess
guard
yourself
against
princess
elizabeth
your
highness
are
you
in
earnest
smilingly
asked
anna
drawing
her
silver
nearer
to
her
person
and
placing
a
bouquet
of
flowers
in
her
hair
to
examine
its
effect
in
the
glass
oh
heavens
cried
count
ostermann
you
adorn
yourself
with
flowers
while
i
am
telling
you
that
you
are
threatened
with
a
conspiracy
a
conspiracy
laughed
the
regent
and
princess
elizabeth
to
be
at
the
head
of
it
believe
me
you
overwise
men
with
all
your
wisdom
never
learn
rightly
to
understand
women
i
however
am
a
woman
and
i
understand
elizabeth
you
think
that
when
she
kindly
chats
with
the
soldiers
and
admits
the
handsome
stately
grenadiers
into
her
house
it
is
done
for
the
purpose
of
conspiring
with
them
go
to
count
ostermann
you
are
very
innocent
princess
elizabeth
has
but
one
passion
but
it
is
not
the
desire
of
ruling
and
when
she
chats
with
handsome
men
she
speaks
not
of
conspiracy
believe
and
laughing
the
regent
essayed
a
new
and
how
do
you
explain
the
secret
meetings
of
lestocq
and
the
marquis
de
la
chetardie
asked
ostermann
with
agitation
explain
why
should
i
seek
an
explanation
for
things
that
do
not
at
all
interest
me
what
is
it
to
me
what
the
surgeon
lestocq
has
to
do
with
the
french
ambassador
or
do
you
think
i
should
trouble
myself
about
the
administered
to
an
ambassador
by
a
surgeon
well
then
your
highness
will
allow
me
to
explain
their
meetings
from
a
less
medical
point
of
view
france
is
your
enemy
france
meditates
your
destruction
and
the
marquis
de
la
chetardie
is
exciting
the
princess
and
lestocq
to
an
and
to
what
end
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
ask
scornfully
inquired
anna
france
struggling
with
internal
and
foreign
enemies
at
war
with
austria
involved
in
disputes
with
holland
and
spain
france
would
wish
at
any
price
to
see
the
russian
government
so
occupied
with
her
own
domestic
difficulties
as
to
have
no
time
to
devote
to
international
affairs
she
would
provide
you
with
plenty
of
occupation
at
home
that
you
may
not
actively
interfere
with
the
affairs
of
the
rest
of
the
world
that
is
the
shrewd
policy
of
france
and
it
would
fill
me
with
admiration
were
it
not
fraught
with
the
most
terrible
danger
to
us
the
marquis
de
la
chetardie
has
it
in
charge
to
bring
about
a
revolution
here
at
any
price
and
as
an
expert
diplomatist
he
very
well
comprehends
that
princess
elizabeth
is
the
best
means
he
can
employ
for
that
purpose
for
she
as
the
daughter
of
czar
peter
has
the
sympathies
of
the
old
russians
in
her
favor
and
they
will
flock
to
her
with
shouts
of
joy
whenever
she
may
announce
to
the
people
that
she
is
ready
to
drive
the
foreign
rulers
from
russia
ah
our
good
russians
laughingly
exclaimed
the
regent
they
shout
only
for
those
who
make
them
drunk
and
for
that
the
poor
princess
lacks
the
means
the
marquis
de
la
chetardie
has
in
the
name
of
his
king
offered
her
an
unlimited
credit
and
she
is
already
provided
with
almost
a
million
of
silver
you
have
a
reason
for
every
thing
laughed
the
regent
the
princess
is
poor
let
the
french
ambassador
quickly
provide
her
with
his
millions
the
good
princess
i
wish
she
had
these
millions
and
then
she
could
indulge
her
love
of
ornaments
and
magnificent
the
marquis
has
brought
her
rich
dresses
and
stuffs
from
paris
said
ostermann
laconically
the
regent
burst
into
a
clear
ringing
laugh
the
marquis
is
a
real
ex
exclaimed
she
wherever
you
need
him
he
appears
and
helps
you
out
of
your
trouble
but
seriously
my
dear
count
let
it
now
suffice
with
these
gloomy
suspicions
they
are
already
commencing
the
and
you
will
put
me
out
of
tune
with
your
croaking
a
ball
my
dear
count
requires
that
one
should
be
in
and
not
out
of
tune
and
you
are
pursuing
the
best
course
to
frighten
the
smiles
from
my
oh
could
i
but
do
that
cried
ostermann
wringing
his
hands
could
i
but
cry
in
your
ear
with
a
voice
of
thunder
princess
awake
from
this
slumber
of
indifference
force
yourself
to
act
save
your
son
your
husband
your
friends
for
we
are
all
all
lost
with
you
oh
speaking
of
my
son
smilingly
interposed
the
regent
you
must
see
a
splendid
present
which
the
emperor
ivan
has
this
day
with
this
she
took
from
a
carton
a
small
child
s
dress
embroidered
with
gold
and
sparkling
with
brilliants
which
she
handed
to
the
count
only
look
at
this
splendor
said
she
the
ladies
of
moscow
have
embroidered
this
for
the
young
emperor
and
it
has
been
presented
by
a
deputation
will
not
the
little
emperor
make
a
magnificent
appearance
in
this
brilliant
dress
count
ostermann
did
not
answer
immediately
his
face
had
assumed
a
very
painful
expression
and
deep
signs
escaped
his
agitated
breast
slowly
rising
from
his
seat
with
a
sad
glance
at
the
princess
he
said
i
see
that
your
destruction
is
inevitable
and
i
can
not
save
you
you
will
be
ruined
and
we
all
with
you
well
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
pardon
your
highness
for
you
act
not
thus
from
an
evil
disposition
but
because
you
have
a
noble
and
confiding
heart
believe
me
generosity
and
confidence
are
the
worst
failings
with
which
a
man
can
be
tainted
in
this
world
failings
which
always
insure
destruction
and
have
only
mockery
and
derision
for
an
epitaph
you
are
no
longer
to
be
helped
duchess
you
are
on
the
borders
of
an
abyss
into
which
you
will
smilingly
plunge
dragging
us
all
after
you
well
peace
be
with
you
my
sufferings
have
lately
been
so
great
that
i
can
only
thank
you
for
furnishing
me
with
the
means
of
quickly
ending
them
madame
we
shall
meet
again
on
the
scaffold
or
in
siberia
until
then
farewell
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
from
the
regent
the
old
man
groaning
tottered
out
of
the
room
thank
heaven
that
he
is
gone
said
anna
drawing
a
long
breath
when
the
door
closed
behind
him
this
old
has
tormented
me
for
months
with
his
strange
vagaries
which
weigh
upon
his
soul
like
the
nightmare
happily
thy
letter
my
beloved
has
filled
my
whole
heart
with
the
ecstasy
of
joy
else
would
his
dark
and
foolish
prophecies
be
sufficient
to
sadden
thus
speaking
the
princess
again
drew
count
lynar
s
letter
from
her
bosom
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
then
she
called
her
women
to
dress
her
for
the
ball
the
court
ball
some
hours
later
the
of
the
higher
russian
nobility
were
assembled
in
the
magnificent
halls
of
the
regent
princes
and
counts
generals
and
diplomatists
beautiful
women
and
blooming
maidens
all
moved
in
a
confused
intermixture
jesting
and
laughing
with
each
other
they
were
all
very
gay
on
this
evening
as
the
regent
had
herself
set
the
example
with
the
most
unconstrained
cheerfulness
radiant
with
joy
did
she
wander
through
the
rooms
dispensing
smiles
and
agreeable
words
among
all
whom
she
approached
she
bore
in
her
bosom
the
glowing
and
cherished
letter
of
her
lover
and
at
its
lightest
rustling
she
seemed
to
feel
the
immediate
presence
of
the
writer
that
was
the
secret
of
her
gayety
and
her
joyous
smiles
people
perhaps
knew
not
this
secret
but
they
saw
its
effects
and
as
the
regent
deigned
this
day
to
be
cheerful
and
smiling
it
was
natural
for
this
host
of
slavish
nobility
who
breathe
nothing
but
the
air
of
the
court
to
adopt
for
this
evening
s
motto
gayety
and
as
we
have
said
only
smiling
lips
and
faces
beaming
with
joy
were
to
be
seen
all
breathed
pleasure
and
enjoyment
all
jested
and
laughed
it
seemed
as
if
all
care
and
sorrow
had
fled
from
this
happy
select
circle
to
give
place
to
the
delights
of
life
they
had
with
submissive
humility
repressed
all
discontent
and
disaffection
all
envyings
and
enmities
they
chatted
and
laughed
while
every
one
knew
or
suspected
that
they
were
standing
on
a
volcano
whose
overwhelming
eruptions
might
be
expected
at
any
moment
and
yet
every
one
feigned
the
most
perfect
innocence
and
unconstraint
the
ladies
scrutinized
each
other
s
magnificent
and
costly
toilets
jesting
and
exchanging
amorous
glances
with
the
gentlemen
displaying
orders
and
diamond
crosses
a
movement
suddenly
arose
in
the
rooms
the
crowd
divided
and
respectfully
withdrew
to
the
sides
and
through
the
rows
of
smiling
humbly
bowing
courtiers
passed
the
princess
elizabeth
followed
by
her
chamberlain
woronzow
her
private
secretary
alexis
razumovsky
and
her
physician
lestocq
in
the
splendor
of
her
beauty
and
grace
all
kindness
all
smiles
she
was
wonderfully
charming
in
her
lace
dress
which
flowed
like
a
breath
over
her
of
heavy
white
satin
her
full
and
luxuriant
shoulders
were
partially
covered
by
a
costly
lace
mantelet
the
present
of
the
french
queen
and
her
long
floating
ringlets
were
surmounted
by
a
wreath
of
white
roses
such
as
only
parisian
artistic
skill
could
offer
in
such
perfect
imitation
of
nature
thus
enveloped
as
it
were
in
a
veil
of
white
mist
and
floating
vapors
elizabeth
s
beauty
appeared
only
the
more
full
and
voluptuous
she
looked
like
a
purple
rose
standing
out
from
a
cloud
of
fluttering
wonderfully
charming
wonderfully
seductive
princess
elizabeth
was
fully
conscious
of
the
impression
she
made
and
this
internal
satisfaction
manifested
itself
in
a
sweet
smile
which
increased
the
charm
of
her
appearance
with
pride
and
pleasure
she
enjoyed
the
triumph
of
being
the
fairest
of
all
the
beauties
present
and
this
triumph
contented
her
heart
the
princess
now
approached
her
cousin
the
regent
anna
who
came
from
the
adjoining
room
to
meet
and
welcome
her
and
for
one
short
moment
the
courtiers
forgot
her
smiles
and
her
inoffensiveness
all
eyes
were
with
the
most
intense
anxiety
directed
toward
those
two
women
all
conversation
jesting
and
laughing
were
at
once
suspended
there
was
a
deep
pause
all
breathing
was
smothered
all
feared
that
the
loud
beating
of
their
hearts
might
betray
them
and
cause
them
to
be
suspected
the
two
princesses
now
approached
each
other
princess
elizabeth
would
have
bent
a
knee
to
the
regent
anna
with
charming
kindness
raising
and
kissing
her
tenderly
reproached
her
for
coming
so
late
i
feared
coming
too
early
said
elizabeth
pressing
the
regent
s
hand
to
her
lips
for
i
doubted
whether
my
fair
cousin
would
find
time
to
bestow
a
friendly
word
upon
her
poor
relation
princess
elizabeth
how
could
elizabeth
fear
that
when
she
knows
i
love
her
like
a
sister
tenderly
asked
the
regent
and
taking
the
arm
of
the
princess
she
made
with
her
a
round
through
the
rooms
now
again
came
life
and
movement
in
this
lately
so
silent
and
anxiously
expectant
assemblage
they
now
knew
how
they
were
to
deport
themselves
princess
elizabeth
was
in
the
good
graces
of
the
regent
and
therefore
they
could
receive
her
polite
greetings
with
the
most
reverential
thankfulness
they
could
approach
her
and
admire
her
beauty
without
incurring
suspicion
the
stereotyped
smile
had
reappeared
upon
all
faces
cheerful
and
lively
conversation
was
again
resumed
and
wherever
the
two
wandering
princesses
appeared
they
were
greeted
with
endless
shouts
of
ecstasy
as
we
have
said
it
was
a
gay
and
very
splendid
festival
only
occasionally
did
something
like
a
dark
shadow
pass
through
the
rooms
only
here
and
there
did
the
chattering
guests
forget
their
wonted
smiles
only
occasionally
did
the
mask
of
cheerfulness
fall
from
many
a
face
discovering
serious
anxious
features
and
suspicious
lurking
glances
every
one
felt
that
a
catastrophe
was
impending
but
as
no
one
could
know
its
result
in
advance
all
wished
to
keep
as
clear
of
it
as
possible
and
seem
perfectly
unconscious
and
unaffected
by
these
things
as
they
could
not
foresee
which
party
would
triumph
they
found
it
advisable
to
join
neither
while
awaiting
coming
events
after
which
they
would
hail
as
lords
and
masters
those
who
might
succeed
in
attaining
to
power
for
the
present
anna
leopoldowna
was
the
ruler
and
as
they
were
her
subjects
they
must
in
humble
submission
pay
homage
to
her
but
elizabeth
might
become
empress
and
therefore
they
must
likewise
pay
homage
to
her
with
a
prudent
avoidance
of
the
too
much
which
might
cause
them
to
be
suspected
in
case
the
regent
should
still
continue
in
power
these
were
the
dangerous
rocks
between
which
this
proud
and
elegant
assemblage
had
to
find
their
winding
way
and
they
did
it
with
smiles
and
outward
ease
with
open
admiration
of
both
princesses
before
whom
they
bowed
to
the
ground
with
slavish
submission
but
suddenly
something
like
a
like
an
unnatural
awe
flew
through
all
these
splendid
halls
the
smiles
were
arrested
on
all
faces
the
harmless
jests
on
all
lips
the
pallor
of
beautiful
women
became
visible
through
their
paint
and
generals
staggered
to
and
fro
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
as
if
touched
by
a
magic
wand
every
one
stood
motionless
like
statues
modelled
in
clay
no
one
daring
to
speak
to
his
neighbor
or
make
a
sign
to
a
friend
they
would
not
see
they
would
not
hear
they
only
wished
to
seem
to
be
indifferent
and
unobserving
as
we
said
a
pervaded
the
halls
and
like
an
passed
over
the
heads
of
the
stiffened
lifeless
crowd
the
dismal
rumor
the
regent
and
the
princess
are
at
variance
the
regent
is
speaking
to
her
with
vehemence
and
the
princess
weeps
this
certainly
was
a
terrible
announcement
but
if
the
regent
was
angry
it
must
be
because
she
knew
of
the
intrigues
and
machinations
of
the
princess
and
knowing
them
she
could
counteract
and
nullify
them
consequently
the
plans
of
the
princess
were
upset
anna
leopoldowna
would
remain
ruler
and
her
son
ivan
the
czar
of
all
the
russias
now
the
touch
the
vicinity
of
elizabeth
s
friends
became
an
pest
a
terror
they
anxiously
avoided
the
vicinity
of
lestocq
they
crowded
back
from
woronzow
and
razumovsky
whom
they
had
before
sought
with
every
demonstration
of
friendliness
they
even
avoided
looking
at
the
french
ambassador
for
if
the
regent
knew
all
she
must
know
of
the
intimate
relations
of
lestocq
with
the
marquis
de
la
chetardie
and
he
was
therefore
doomed
like
the
other
three
and
moreover
this
pernicious
rumor
had
not
lied
the
two
princesses
were
at
this
moment
no
longer
so
tender
and
friendly
disposed
as
shortly
before
they
had
long
wandered
through
the
halls
confidingly
chatting
and
smiling
and
anna
leaning
upon
elizabeth
s
arm
anna
who
this
day
saw
every
thing
de
felt
a
sort
of
disquiet
that
people
should
suspect
her
who
was
walking
by
her
side
with
such
innocent
candor
and
unconstraint
seeming
not
to
have
the
least
presentiment
of
the
dark
cloud
gathering
over
her
head
she
is
inconsiderate
thought
the
regent
she
allows
herself
to
be
carried
away
by
her
temperament
and
behind
her
inclination
and
her
weakness
for
handsome
grenadiers
and
soldiers
her
enemies
seek
to
discover
an
insidious
and
conspiracy
this
is
cruel
and
unjust
this
good
elizabeth
must
be
warned
that
she
may
become
more
cautious
and
give
her
numerous
enemies
no
occasion
for
suspecting
her
poor
innocent
child
so
gay
and
ingenuous
she
plays
with
roses
under
which
serpents
lie
concealed
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
her
and
i
wholly
penetrated
with
this
noble
and
generous
resolution
the
regent
drew
her
cousin
elizabeth
into
the
little
boudoir
which
lay
at
the
end
of
the
hall
offering
a
convenient
for
a
confidential
conversation
but
at
this
moment
anna
s
eyes
fell
upon
the
lace
mantelet
of
the
princess
and
quite
involuntarily
came
to
her
mind
the
warning
words
of
ostermann
who
had
said
to
her
the
french
ambassador
by
command
of
his
government
provides
the
princess
not
only
with
money
but
also
with
the
newest
modes
and
most
costly
this
lace
mantelet
could
surely
only
come
from
paris
nothing
similar
to
it
had
been
seen
in
petersburg
it
certainly
required
especial
sources
and
especial
means
for
the
procurement
of
such
a
rare
and
magnificent
exemplar
a
cloud
drew
over
the
regent
s
brow
and
in
a
rather
sharp
and
cutting
tone
she
said
one
question
princess
how
came
you
by
this
admirable
lace
veil
the
like
of
which
i
have
not
seen
here
in
petersburg
while
putting
this
question
the
regent
s
eyes
were
fixed
with
a
piercing
interrogating
expression
upon
the
face
of
the
princess
she
wished
to
observe
the
slightest
shrinking
the
least
movement
of
her
features
but
elizabeth
was
prepared
for
the
question
she
had
already
considered
her
answer
with
the
marquis
and
lestocq
her
features
therefore
betrayed
not
the
least
disturbance
or
disquiet
raising
her
bright
and
childlike
eyes
she
said
with
an
unconstrained
smile
you
wonder
do
you
not
how
i
came
by
this
costly
ornament
ah
i
have
for
the
last
eight
days
rejoiced
in
the
expectation
of
surprising
you
with
the
sight
of
it
but
you
have
not
yet
told
me
whence
you
have
these
costly
laces
asked
the
regent
in
a
sharper
tone
it
is
a
wager
i
have
won
of
the
good
marquis
de
la
chetardie
said
elizabeth
without
embarrassment
and
your
highness
must
confess
that
this
french
ambassador
has
paid
his
wager
with
much
the
regent
had
constantly
become
more
serious
and
gloomy
a
dark
fatal
suspicion
for
a
moment
overclouded
her
soul
and
in
her
usually
unsuspicious
mind
arose
the
questions
what
if
ostermann
was
right
if
elizabeth
is
really
conspiring
and
the
french
ambassador
is
her
confederate
and
what
if
one
may
ask
was
the
subject
of
the
wager
she
asked
with
the
tone
of
an
inquisitor
ah
this
good
marquis
said
the
princess
laughing
had
never
yet
experienced
the
rigor
of
a
russian
winter
and
he
would
not
believe
that
our
neva
with
its
rushing
streams
and
rapid
current
would
in
winter
be
changed
into
a
very
commodious
highway
i
wagered
that
i
would
convince
him
of
the
fact
and
be
the
first
to
cross
it
on
the
ice
he
would
not
believe
me
and
declared
that
i
should
lack
the
courage
well
of
course
i
did
it
and
won
my
wager
the
regent
had
not
turned
her
eyes
from
the
princess
while
she
was
thus
speaking
this
serene
calmness
this
unembarrassed
childishness
completely
disarmed
her
the
dark
suspicion
vanished
from
her
mind
anna
breathed
freer
and
laid
her
hand
upon
her
heart
as
if
she
would
restrain
its
violent
beating
the
letter
of
lynar
slightly
rustled
under
her
hand
a
ray
of
sunshine
became
visible
in
anna
s
face
she
thought
of
her
beloved
she
felt
his
presence
and
immediately
all
the
vapors
of
mistrust
were
scattered
anna
feared
no
more
she
suspected
no
more
she
again
became
cheerful
and
happy
for
she
thought
of
her
distant
lover
his
affectionate
words
rested
upon
her
bosom
how
therefore
could
she
feel
anger
she
only
now
recollected
that
she
had
intended
to
warn
elizabeth
she
therefore
threw
her
arms
around
the
neck
of
the
princess
and
sitting
with
her
upon
the
divan
said
do
you
know
elizabeth
that
you
have
many
enemies
at
my
court
and
that
they
would
excite
my
suspicions
against
you
ah
i
may
well
believe
they
would
be
glad
to
do
so
but
they
can
not
said
elizabeth
laughing
i
am
a
foolish
trifling
woman
who
unfortunately
for
them
do
nothing
to
my
enemies
that
can
render
me
suspected
as
in
reality
i
do
nothing
at
all
i
am
indolent
anna
very
indolent
you
ought
to
have
raised
me
better
my
dear
lady
regent
and
with
an
amiable
roguishness
elizabeth
kissed
the
tips
of
anna
s
fingers
no
no
be
serious
for
once
said
anna
laugh
not
elizabeth
but
listen
to
me
and
she
related
to
the
listening
princess
how
people
came
from
all
sides
to
warn
her
that
she
was
told
of
secret
meetings
which
lestocq
in
elizabeth
s
name
held
with
the
french
ambassador
and
that
the
object
of
these
meetings
was
the
removal
of
the
regent
and
her
son
and
the
elevation
of
elizabeth
to
the
imperial
throne
elizabeth
remained
perfectly
cheerful
perfectly
unembarrassed
and
even
laughingly
exclaimed
what
a
silly
story
i
believe
nothing
of
it
said
anna
but
at
last
my
ministers
will
compel
me
to
imprison
lestocq
and
bring
him
to
trial
in
order
to
get
the
truth
out
of
ah
they
will
torture
him
and
yet
he
is
innocent
cried
elizabeth
bursting
into
tears
and
clasping
the
regent
s
neck
she
anxiously
exclaimed
ah
anna
dear
anna
save
me
from
my
enemies
let
them
not
steal
away
my
friends
and
ruin
me
they
would
also
torture
me
and
send
me
to
siberia
anna
my
friend
my
sovereign
save
me
you
alone
can
do
it
for
you
know
me
and
know
that
i
am
innocent
the
idea
that
i
should
conspire
against
you
against
you
whom
i
love
and
to
whom
upon
the
sacred
books
of
our
religion
i
have
sworn
eternal
fidelity
and
devotion
anna
anna
i
swear
to
you
by
the
soul
of
my
father
i
am
innocent
as
also
is
my
friend
lestocq
has
never
passed
the
threshold
of
the
french
ambassador
s
hotel
oh
dear
dear
anna
have
mercy
on
me
and
do
not
permit
them
to
torture
me
and
wrench
my
poor
members
with
a
loud
cry
of
anguish
with
streaming
tears
pale
and
trembling
elizabeth
sank
down
at
the
regent
s
feet
it
was
this
cry
of
anguish
that
rang
through
the
hall
and
spread
everywhere
astonishment
and
consternation
and
this
shrieking
and
weeping
and
trembling
was
no
mask
but
truth
elizabeth
was
frightened
she
wept
and
trembled
from
fear
but
she
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
not
to
betray
herself
in
words
it
was
fear
even
that
gave
her
that
presence
of
mind
and
enabled
her
to
play
her
part
in
a
manner
so
masterly
that
the
regent
was
completely
deceived
taking
the
princess
in
her
arms
she
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
at
the
same
time
endeavoring
to
reassure
and
console
her
with
tender
and
affectionate
words
with
reiterated
promises
of
her
protection
and
her
love
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
trembling
and
weeping
princess
could
be
tranquillized
before
she
could
be
made
to
believe
anna
s
asseverations
that
she
had
always
loved
and
never
mistrusted
her
what
most
deeply
saddens
me
said
elizabeth
with
feeling
is
the
idea
that
you
my
anna
could
believe
these
calumnies
and
suppose
me
capable
of
such
black
treason
ah
i
should
be
as
bad
as
judas
iscariot
could
i
betray
my
noble
and
generous
tears
of
emotion
stood
in
anna
s
eyes
she
impressed
a
tender
kiss
upon
elizabeth
s
lips
and
with
her
own
hand
wiped
the
tears
from
the
cheeks
of
the
princess
weep
no
more
elizabeth
she
tenderly
said
nay
i
beg
of
you
weep
no
more
it
is
indeed
all
right
and
good
between
us
and
no
cloud
shall
disturb
our
love
or
our
mutual
confidence
come
let
us
smile
and
be
cheerful
again
that
this
listening
and
curious
court
may
know
nothing
of
your
tears
they
would
make
a
prodigious
affair
of
it
and
we
will
not
give
them
occasion
to
say
we
have
been
at
no
they
shall
all
see
that
i
love
that
i
adore
you
said
elizabeth
covering
anna
s
hand
with
kisses
they
shall
see
that
we
love
each
other
said
anna
taking
the
arm
of
the
princess
be
of
good
cheer
my
friend
and
take
my
imperial
word
for
it
that
i
whatever
people
may
say
of
you
will
believe
no
one
but
yourself
that
i
will
truly
inform
you
of
all
calumnies
and
give
you
an
opportunity
to
disarm
your
enemies
and
defend
yourself
now
come
and
let
us
make
another
tour
through
the
arm
in
arm
the
two
princesses
returned
to
the
nearest
hall
this
was
empty
no
one
daring
to
remain
there
lest
they
might
incur
the
blame
of
having
overheard
and
understood
some
word
of
the
princesses
and
thus
acquired
a
knowledge
of
their
private
conversation
people
had
therefore
withdrawn
to
the
more
distant
rooms
where
they
still
preserved
a
breathless
silence
suddenly
the
two
princesses
arm
in
arm
again
appeared
in
the
halls
pleasantly
conversing
and
instantly
the
scene
was
again
changed
as
if
by
the
stroke
of
a
magic
wand
the
chilling
silence
melted
into
an
agreeable
smile
and
all
recovered
their
breaths
and
former
joviality
all
was
again
sunshine
and
pleasure
for
the
princesses
were
again
there
and
the
princesses
smiled
must
they
not
laugh
and
be
beside
themselves
with
joy
elizabeth
s
tender
glances
sought
her
friend
the
handsome
alexis
razumovsky
suddenly
her
brow
as
darkened
and
her
cheeks
paled
for
she
saw
him
and
saw
that
his
eyes
did
not
seek
hers
he
stood
leaning
against
a
pillar
his
eyes
fixed
upon
a
lady
who
had
just
then
entered
the
hall
and
whose
wonderful
beauty
had
everywhere
called
forth
a
murmur
of
astonishment
and
admiration
this
lady
was
the
countess
lapuschkin
the
wife
of
the
of
marine
from
whose
family
came
the
first
wife
of
czar
peter
the
great
the
beautiful
eudoxia
lapuschkin
eleonore
lapuschkin
was
more
beautiful
than
eudoxia
an
infinite
magic
of
youth
and
loveliness
of
purity
and
energy
was
shed
over
her
regular
features
she
had
the
traits
of
a
hebe
and
the
form
of
a
juno
when
she
smiled
and
displayed
her
dazzlingly
white
teeth
she
was
irresistibly
charming
when
in
a
serious
mood
she
raised
her
large
dark
eyes
full
of
nobleness
and
spirit
then
might
people
fall
at
her
feet
with
adoration
countess
lapuschkin
had
often
been
compared
and
equalled
to
the
princess
elizabeth
and
yet
nothing
could
be
more
dissimilar
or
incomparable
than
these
two
beauties
elizabeth
s
was
wholly
earthly
voluptuous
glowing
with
youth
and
love
but
eleonore
s
was
chaste
and
sublime
pure
and
maidenly
elizabeth
allured
to
love
eleonore
to
adoration
the
princess
had
long
hated
the
young
countess
eleonore
lapuschkin
and
considered
her
as
a
rival
but
that
this
rival
should
now
gain
an
interest
in
the
heart
of
her
favorite
that
filled
elizabeth
s
soul
with
anger
and
agitation
that
caused
her
eyes
to
flash
and
her
blood
to
boil
staringly
as
alexis
razumovsky
s
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
countess
she
unconscious
of
this
double
observation
stood
cheerful
and
unembarrassed
in
the
circle
of
her
admiring
friends
and
adorers
anna
leopoldowna
followed
the
glance
of
the
princess
and
observing
the
beautiful
lapuschkin
said
without
thinking
of
elizabeth
s
very
susceptible
vanity
leonore
lapuschkin
is
an
admirably
beautiful
woman
is
she
not
i
never
saw
a
handsomer
one
to
look
at
her
is
like
a
morning
dream
her
appearance
diffuses
light
and
splendor
do
you
not
find
it
so
elizabeth
oh
yes
i
find
it
so
said
elizabeth
with
a
constrained
smile
she
is
the
handsomest
woman
in
your
yourself
excepted
elizabeth
kindly
subjoined
the
regent
oh
no
she
is
handsomer
than
i
murmured
elizabeth
poor
leonore
in
this
moment
hath
the
princess
pronounced
your
sentence
of
condemnation
and
in
her
heart
subscribed
the
stern
order
for
your
execution
a
longer
view
of
this
triumph
of
the
countess
became
insufferable
alleging
a
sudden
attack
of
illness
she
immediately
took
leave
of
the
regent
and
ordered
her
carriage
tears
of
anger
and
love
stood
in
her
eyes
as
razumovsky
approached
to
aid
her
in
entering
it
hurling
away
his
hand
she
entered
the
carriage
without
assistance
and
may
i
not
accompany
you
in
the
carriage
as
usual
asked
alexis
with
tenderness
in
his
tone
no
she
curtly
said
go
back
into
the
hall
and
again
admire
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
empire
then
jealousy
getting
the
better
of
anger
she
beckoned
to
alexis
who
was
about
departing
in
sadness
and
commanded
him
to
enter
the
carriage
without
delay
as
soon
as
the
carriage
door
was
closed
with
an
angry
movement
she
seized
both
of
razumovsky
s
hands
look
at
me
said
she
look
me
directly
in
the
eye
and
then
tell
me
is
eleonore
lapuschkin
handsomer
than
i
the
it
was
the
day
after
the
court
ball
princess
elizabeth
was
in
her
and
occupied
in
enveloping
herself
in
a
very
charming
and
seductive
she
was
in
very
good
humor
very
happy
and
free
from
care
for
alexis
razumovsky
had
with
the
most
solemn
asserverations
assured
her
of
his
truth
and
devotion
and
elizabeth
had
been
soothed
and
reconciled
by
his
glowing
language
it
was
for
him
that
she
wished
to
appear
especially
attractive
that
alexis
by
the
sight
of
her
might
be
made
utterly
to
forget
the
countess
eleonore
lapuschkin
in
these
coquettish
efforts
of
her
vanity
she
had
utterly
forgotten
all
the
plans
and
projects
of
her
friends
and
adherents
she
thought
no
more
of
becoming
empress
but
she
would
be
the
queen
of
beauty
and
in
that
realm
she
would
reign
alone
with
an
absolute
sway
a
servant
announced
lestocq
a
cloud
of
displeasure
lowered
on
the
brow
of
the
princess
startled
from
her
sweet
dreams
by
this
name
she
now
for
the
first
time
recollected
the
fatal
conversation
she
had
had
on
the
previous
evening
with
the
regent
in
her
love
and
jealousy
she
had
totally
forgotten
the
occurrence
but
now
that
she
was
reminded
of
it
she
felt
her
head
throb
with
anxiety
and
terror
dismissing
her
attendants
with
an
imperious
nod
she
hastened
to
meet
the
entering
physician
lestocq
said
she
it
is
well
you
have
come
at
this
moment
else
perhaps
i
might
have
forgotten
to
say
to
you
that
it
is
all
over
with
the
conjuration
spun
and
woven
by
you
and
the
french
marquis
we
must
give
it
up
for
the
affair
is
more
dangerous
than
you
think
it
and
i
may
say
that
you
have
reason
to
be
thankful
to
me
for
having
by
my
foresight
and
intrepidity
saved
you
from
the
torture
and
a
possible
transportation
to
siberia
ah
it
is
very
cold
in
siberia
my
dear
lestocq
and
you
will
do
well
silently
and
discreetly
to
build
a
warm
nest
here
instead
of
inventing
ambitious
projects
dangerous
to
all
of
and
whence
do
you
foresee
danger
princess
asked
lestocq
the
regent
knows
all
she
knows
our
plans
and
combinations
in
a
word
she
knows
that
we
conspire
and
that
you
are
the
principal
agent
in
the
then
i
am
lost
sighed
lestocq
gliding
down
upon
a
chair
no
not
quite
said
elizabeth
with
a
smile
for
i
have
saved
you
ah
i
should
never
have
believed
that
the
playing
of
comedy
was
so
easy
but
i
tell
you
i
have
played
one
in
a
masterly
manner
fear
was
my
teacher
it
taught
me
to
appear
so
innocent
to
implore
so
affectingly
that
anna
herself
was
touched
ah
and
i
wept
whole
streams
of
tears
i
tell
you
that
quite
disarmed
the
regent
but
you
must
bear
the
blame
if
my
eyes
are
yet
red
with
weeping
and
not
so
brilliant
as
and
princess
elizabeth
ran
to
the
to
examine
critically
her
face
in
the
glass
yes
indeed
she
cried
with
a
sort
of
terror
it
is
as
i
feared
my
eyes
are
quite
dull
lestocq
you
must
give
me
a
means
a
quick
and
sure
means
to
restore
their
thus
speaking
elizabeth
looked
constantly
in
the
glass
full
of
care
and
anxiety
about
her
eyes
i
shall
appear
less
beautiful
to
him
she
murmured
he
will
in
thought
compare
me
with
eleonore
lapuschkin
and
find
her
handsomer
than
lestocq
lestocq
she
then
called
aloud
impatiently
stamping
with
her
little
foot
i
tell
you
that
you
must
immediately
prescribe
a
remedy
that
will
restore
the
brilliancy
of
my
princess
said
lestocq
with
solemnity
i
beseech
you
for
a
moment
to
forget
your
incomparable
beauty
and
the
unequalled
brilliancy
of
your
eyes
be
not
only
a
woman
but
be
as
you
can
the
great
czar
s
great
daughter
princess
the
question
here
is
not
only
of
the
diminished
brilliancy
of
your
eyes
but
of
a
real
danger
with
which
you
are
threatened
be
merciful
be
gracious
and
relate
to
me
the
exact
words
of
your
yesterday
s
conversation
with
the
the
princess
looked
up
from
her
mirror
and
turned
her
head
toward
lestocq
ah
i
forgot
she
carelessly
said
you
are
not
merely
my
physician
but
also
a
revolutionist
and
that
is
of
much
greater
importance
to
the
question
is
of
your
head
princess
and
as
a
true
physician
i
would
help
you
to
preserve
it
therefore
dearest
princess
i
beseech
you
repeat
to
me
that
conversation
with
the
will
you
then
immediately
give
me
a
recipe
for
my
eyes
yes
i
well
listen
and
the
princess
repeated
word
for
word
to
the
breathless
lestocq
her
conversation
with
anna
leopoldowna
lestocq
listened
to
her
with
most
intense
interest
taking
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
table
and
mechanically
writing
some
unmeaning
lines
upon
it
with
an
appearance
of
heedlessness
perhaps
it
was
this
mechanical
occupation
that
enabled
him
to
remain
so
calm
and
circumspect
during
the
narration
of
the
princess
his
features
again
assumed
their
expression
of
firmness
and
determination
his
eyes
again
flashed
and
around
his
mouth
played
a
saucy
scornful
smile
such
as
was
usually
seen
there
when
conscious
of
his
superiority
he
had
formed
a
bold
resolution
this
good
regent
has
executed
a
stroke
of
policy
for
which
ostermann
will
never
forgive
her
said
he
after
the
princess
had
finished
her
narration
she
should
have
kept
silence
and
appeared
unconstrained
then
should
have
been
lost
but
now
it
is
no
exclaimed
the
princess
with
generous
emotion
the
regent
has
chosen
precisely
the
best
means
for
disarming
us
she
has
manifested
a
noble
confidence
in
me
she
has
discredited
the
whisperings
of
her
minister
and
counsellors
and
instead
of
destroying
me
as
she
should
have
done
she
has
warned
me
with
the
kindness
and
affection
of
a
sister
i
shall
never
forget
that
lestocq
i
shall
ever
be
grateful
for
that
henceforth
the
regent
or
empress
anna
leopoldowna
shall
have
no
truer
or
more
obedient
subject
than
i
the
princess
elizabeth
by
this
you
would
not
say
princess
by
this
i
mean
to
say
interposed
elizabeth
that
this
conspiracy
is
brought
to
a
bloodless
conclusion
and
that
from
this
hour
there
is
but
one
woman
in
this
great
russian
realm
who
has
any
claim
to
the
title
of
empress
and
that
woman
is
the
regent
anna
leopoldowna
you
will
therefore
renounce
your
sacred
and
claims
to
the
imperial
throne
asked
lestocq
continuing
his
scribbling
yes
that
will
i
responded
elizabeth
i
will
no
longer
be
plagued
with
your
plans
and
machinations
i
will
have
repose
in
the
interior
of
my
palace
i
will
be
empress
there
will
i
establish
a
realm
a
realm
of
peace
and
enjoyable
happiness
there
will
i
erect
the
temple
of
love
and
consecrate
myself
as
its
priestess
no
speak
no
more
of
revolutions
and
conspiracies
i
am
not
made
to
sit
upon
a
throne
as
the
feared
and
thundering
goddess
of
cowardly
slaves
causing
millions
to
tremble
at
every
word
and
glance
i
will
not
be
empress
not
the
bugbear
of
a
quaking
kneeling
people
i
will
be
a
woman
who
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
and
drudgery
of
men
i
will
not
be
plagued
with
labor
and
care
but
will
enjoy
and
rejoice
in
my
existence
for
that
you
will
be
allowed
no
time
said
lestocq
with
solemnity
when
you
give
up
your
plans
and
renounce
your
rights
then
princess
it
will
be
all
over
with
the
days
of
enjoyment
and
happiness
it
will
then
no
longer
be
permitted
you
to
convert
your
palace
into
a
temple
of
pleasure
and
thenceforth
you
will
be
known
only
as
the
priestess
of
misfortune
and
misery
you
have
again
your
said
elizabeth
smiling
come
i
will
awaken
you
i
have
told
you
my
story
it
is
now
for
you
to
give
me
a
recipe
for
my
inflamed
here
it
is
earnestly
answered
lestocq
handing
to
the
princess
the
paper
upon
which
he
had
been
scribbling
elizabeth
took
it
and
at
first
regarded
it
with
smiling
curiosity
but
her
features
gradually
assumed
a
more
serious
and
even
terrified
expression
and
the
roses
faded
from
her
cheeks
you
call
this
a
recipe
for
eyes
reddened
with
weeping
said
she
with
a
shudder
and
yet
it
presents
two
pictures
which
make
my
hair
bristle
with
terror
and
might
cause
one
to
weep
himself
blind
they
represent
our
future
said
lestocq
with
decision
you
see
that
man
bound
upon
the
wheel
that
is
myself
now
look
at
the
second
this
young
woman
who
is
wringing
her
hands
and
whose
head
one
of
these
nuns
is
shearing
while
the
other
is
endeavoring
in
spite
of
her
struggling
resistance
to
envelope
her
in
that
black
veil
that
is
you
princess
for
you
the
cloister
for
me
the
wheel
that
will
be
our
future
princess
elizabeth
if
you
now
hesitate
in
your
forward
march
in
the
path
upon
which
you
have
once
entered
and
to
persevere
in
this
conspiracy
is
to
give
ourselves
up
to
certain
destruction
for
doubt
not
they
will
be
able
to
convict
us
among
grunstein
s
enlisted
friends
there
are
drunkards
enough
who
would
betray
you
for
a
flask
of
brandy
princess
elizabeth
would
you
be
a
nun
or
an
empress
choose
between
these
two
destinations
there
is
no
middle
then
i
would
be
an
empress
said
elizabeth
with
flashing
eyes
trembling
with
anxiety
and
excitement
and
still
examining
the
two
drawings
ah
you
are
an
accomplished
artist
lestocq
you
have
designed
this
picture
with
a
horrible
truth
of
resemblance
how
i
stand
there
how
i
wring
my
hands
the
pale
lips
opened
for
a
cry
of
terror
and
yet
silenced
by
a
view
of
those
dreadful
shears
before
whose
deadly
operations
my
hair
falls
to
the
earth
and
that
veil
entombs
me
while
yet
living
and
casting
away
the
drawings
the
princess
trod
them
under
foot
declaring
in
a
loud
and
imperious
tone
these
drawings
are
false
lestocq
and
that
will
i
prove
to
you
i
the
empress
elizabeth
all
hail
my
empress
cried
lestocq
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
and
kissing
the
hem
of
her
robe
blessings
upon
you
for
you
have
now
rescued
me
from
the
hands
of
the
executioner
you
have
saved
my
life
in
return
for
which
i
will
this
day
place
an
imperial
crown
upon
your
heavenly
this
day
asked
elizabeth
with
a
shudder
yes
it
must
be
done
this
very
night
we
must
improve
the
moment
for
only
the
moment
is
ours
every
hour
of
delay
but
brings
us
nearer
to
our
destruction
yet
one
night
of
hesitation
and
they
will
already
have
rendered
our
success
impossible
ah
the
regent
anna
has
sworn
to
believe
only
you
and
never
to
doubt
you
and
yet
she
has
ordered
three
battalions
of
the
guards
to
march
early
in
the
morning
to
join
the
army
in
viborg
our
friends
and
confidants
are
in
these
three
battalions
judge
then
how
very
much
anna
leopoldowna
confides
in
you
ah
if
it
be
really
so
said
elizabeth
then
can
i
no
longer
have
any
regard
for
her
anna
will
remove
my
friends
from
here
and
that
is
a
betrayal
of
the
friendship
she
has
sworn
for
me
i
have
therefore
no
further
obligations
toward
her
i
am
free
to
act
as
i
think
best
lestocq
i
will
be
no
nun
but
an
empress
you
now
have
my
word
and
are
at
liberty
to
make
all
necessary
arrangements
if
it
must
be
done
let
it
be
done
quickly
and
unhesitatingly
i
have
yet
the
courage
to
dare
any
enormity
therefore
let
us
utilize
this
day
expect
me
at
twelve
o
clock
said
lestocq
rising
i
will
then
be
here
to
bring
you
the
imperial
this
firm
confidence
made
elizabeth
tremble
again
until
now
all
had
seemed
like
a
dream
a
play
of
the
imagination
but
when
she
read
in
lestocq
s
bold
and
resolved
features
that
it
was
a
reality
she
shook
with
terror
and
an
anxious
fear
overpowered
her
soul
and
if
it
miscarry
said
she
thoughtfully
it
will
not
and
can
not
miscarry
responded
lestocq
the
right
is
on
your
side
and
god
will
watch
over
the
daughter
of
the
great
and
then
when
i
am
really
empress
said
elizabeth
thoughtfully
to
herself
what
then
there
is
no
happiness
in
it
they
will
give
me
another
title
they
will
place
a
crown
upon
my
head
and
bind
me
to
a
throne
i
shall
no
longer
be
free
to
act
according
to
my
will
to
live
as
i
would
thousands
of
spies
will
lurk
around
me
thousands
of
eyes
will
follow
my
steps
thousands
of
ears
will
listen
for
my
every
word
in
order
to
interpret
and
attach
a
secret
meaning
to
it
they
will
call
me
an
empress
but
i
shall
be
a
slave
bound
with
golden
fetters
upon
whose
head
sits
a
golden
crown
of
thorns
and
this
toil
and
weariness
these
tiresome
sittings
of
the
ministers
this
and
the
signing
of
orders
and
commands
how
horrible
lestocq
suddenly
cried
the
princess
aloud
if
i
must
always
labor
and
make
laws
and
subscribe
my
name
and
command
and
govern
then
i
will
be
no
empress
no
never
you
shall
be
empress
only
to
enjoy
life
in
its
highest
splendor
we
your
servants
and
slaves
we
will
work
and
govern
for
you
said
lestocq
swear
that
to
me
swear
to
me
that
i
shall
not
be
constrained
to
labor
swear
that
you
will
govern
for
me
that
i
may
devote
my
time
to
the
enjoyment
of
life
i
swear
it
to
you
by
all
that
is
most
sacred
to
well
then
i
will
be
your
empress
said
elizabeth
satisfied
at
this
moment
a
secret
door
opened
and
gave
admission
to
alexis
razumovsky
by
his
entrance
elizabeth
was
reminded
of
her
inflamed
eyes
and
of
the
fair
countess
eleanore
lapuschkin
she
gave
alexis
a
searching
scrutinizing
glance
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
appeared
less
tender
and
ardent
than
usual
oh
she
proudly
said
motioning
her
favorite
to
approach
her
and
lightly
kissing
him
upon
the
forehead
oh
i
will
yet
compel
you
to
adore
me
when
an
imperial
crown
encircles
my
brow
then
will
you
be
obliged
to
confess
that
i
am
the
fairest
of
women
alexis
on
this
night
shall
i
become
an
empress
with
a
cry
of
joy
alexis
sank
to
her
feet
hail
to
my
adored
empress
he
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
hail
elizabeth
the
fairest
of
all
women
with
the
exception
of
the
beautiful
countess
lapuschkin
said
elizabeth
with
a
bitter
smile
ah
when
i
am
empress
i
shall
at
least
have
the
power
to
render
that
woman
harmless
and
to
annihilate
her
you
turn
pale
alexis
she
continued
with
more
vehemence
your
hand
trembles
in
mine
you
must
therefore
love
her
very
much
this
exalted
queen
of
godlike
beauty
ah
i
shall
know
how
to
punish
her
for
it
princess
reproachfully
exclaimed
alexis
elizabeth
you
my
august
and
gentle
empress
you
will
not
sacrifice
an
innocent
woman
to
a
momentary
jealous
vagary
ah
he
ventures
to
intercede
for
her
cried
elizabeth
with
a
hoarse
laugh
and
turning
to
lestocq
she
continued
with
eyes
lestocq
i
have
yet
a
condition
to
make
before
consenting
to
become
an
name
your
condition
princess
and
if
it
be
within
the
compass
of
human
power
it
shall
be
casting
an
angry
glance
at
razumovsky
elizabeth
said
with
a
sinister
smile
swear
to
me
by
all
you
hold
most
sacred
to
find
some
fault
in
this
countess
lapuschkin
which
shall
give
me
the
right
to
condemn
her
to
death
i
swear
it
by
all
i
hold
most
sacred
solemnly
responded
lestocq
and
you
will
do
well
in
that
exclaimed
alexis
for
when
a
crime
rests
upon
her
and
she
only
with
a
word
or
look
offends
against
my
fair
and
noble
empress
she
will
deserve
such
you
will
then
defend
her
no
longer
asked
the
somewhat
appeased
princess
bending
down
to
her
kneeling
lover
what
is
countess
lapuschkin
to
me
tenderly
responded
alexis
for
me
there
is
but
one
woman
one
empress
and
one
beauty
and
that
is
elizabeth
the
princess
smiled
with
satisfaction
lestocq
said
she
this
time
i
keep
my
word
i
am
ready
to
dare
all
in
order
to
place
the
imperial
crown
upon
my
head
i
must
and
will
be
empress
that
i
may
have
the
power
to
reward
you
all
and
to
raise
you
my
alexis
to
me
and
drawing
the
handsome
alexis
up
to
herself
she
gave
him
her
hand
to
kiss
i
now
go
to
make
all
necessary
preparations
said
lestocq
at
midnight
i
will
come
for
you
be
ready
at
that
time
elizabeth
i
will
then
be
ready
said
princess
elizabeth
nodding
a
farewell
to
lestocq
at
midnight
she
then
thoughtfully
continued
well
we
have
twelve
hours
until
then
which
will
suffice
for
the
invention
of
a
suitable
toilet
alexis
tell
me
what
sort
of
dress
i
shall
wear
what
color
best
becomes
me
and
in
what
shall
i
please
the
soldiers
the
toilet
my
alexis
is
often
decisive
in
such
cases
an
unsuitable
costume
might
cause
me
to
displease
the
conspirators
and
lead
them
to
give
up
the
enterprise
you
must
aid
me
alexis
in
choosing
a
costume
come
let
us
repair
to
the
wardrobe
and
call
my
women
i
will
try
on
all
my
dresses
one
after
the
other
then
you
shall
decide
which
is
most
becoming
and
that
will
we
the
princess
and
her
lover
betook
themselves
to
the
wardrobe
and
called
her
women
to
assist
in
selecting
a
suitable
the
revolution
night
had
come
the
lights
in
palaces
and
houses
were
gradually
extinguished
petersburg
began
to
sleep
or
at
least
to
give
itself
the
appearance
of
sleeping
the
regent
anna
leopoldowna
also
had
already
dismissed
her
household
and
withdrawn
into
her
private
apartments
it
was
a
fine
starlight
night
anna
leaned
upon
the
thoughtfully
and
dreamily
glancing
up
at
the
heavens
her
eyes
gradually
filled
with
tears
which
slowly
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
fell
upon
her
hands
she
was
startled
by
the
falling
of
these
warm
glowing
drops
she
was
thinking
of
lynar
of
the
distant
one
to
whom
she
would
gladly
have
devoted
her
whole
existence
but
to
whom
she
could
belong
only
through
falsehood
she
thought
it
would
be
nobler
and
greater
to
renounce
him
that
her
love
might
be
consecrated
by
her
abnegation
while
actually
devoting
her
life
to
the
duties
enjoined
by
the
laws
and
the
church
but
these
thoughts
filled
her
bosom
with
a
nameless
sorrow
and
it
was
involuntarily
that
she
wept
no
she
murmured
low
i
can
not
make
this
sacrifice
i
can
not
make
an
offering
of
my
love
to
my
virtue
for
this
bugbear
of
a
compulsory
marriage
i
can
not
give
up
a
love
which
god
himself
has
inspired
in
my
heart
then
let
it
be
so
let
the
world
judge
and
the
priests
condemn
me
i
will
not
sacrifice
my
love
to
a
prejudice
i
know
that
this
is
sinful
but
god
will
have
compassion
on
the
sinner
who
has
no
other
happiness
on
earth
than
this
only
one
a
love
that
controls
her
whole
being
and
if
this
sin
must
be
punished
oh
my
maker
i
pray
you
to
pardon
him
and
let
the
punishment
fall
on
me
alone
thus
speaking
she
raised
her
arms
and
directed
her
eyes
toward
the
heavens
in
fervent
prayer
suddenly
a
brilliant
light
flashed
through
the
air
a
star
had
shot
from
its
sphere
and
after
a
short
course
had
become
extinguished
that
bodes
misfortune
said
anna
with
a
shudder
her
head
sinking
upon
her
breast
at
this
moment
there
was
a
loud
knocking
at
her
door
and
prince
ulrich
anna
s
husband
earnestly
demanded
admission
anna
hastened
to
open
asking
with
surprise
the
cause
of
his
unusual
visit
anna
said
the
prince
hastily
entering
i
come
to
warn
you
once
more
again
has
a
warning
letter
been
mysteriously
conveyed
to
me
i
have
just
found
it
upon
my
see
for
yourself
it
implores
us
to
be
on
our
guard
it
informs
us
that
we
are
threatened
with
a
frightful
danger
that
elizabeth
conspires
and
that
we
are
lost
if
we
do
not
instantly
take
preventive
anna
read
the
warning
letter
and
then
smilingly
gave
it
back
to
her
husband
always
the
same
old
song
the
same
croaking
of
the
toad
said
she
count
ostermann
has
taken
it
into
his
head
that
elizabeth
is
conspiring
and
doubtless
all
these
warning
letters
come
from
him
read
them
no
more
in
future
my
husband
and
now
let
us
retire
to
and
what
if
it
were
nevertheless
true
said
the
prince
pressingly
if
we
are
really
threatened
with
a
great
danger
a
word
from
you
can
turn
it
away
let
us
therefore
be
careful
remember
your
son
anna
life
is
also
threatened
protect
him
mother
of
the
emperor
allow
me
the
generalissimo
of
your
forces
to
take
measures
of
precaution
let
me
establish
patrols
and
cause
a
regiment
for
whose
fidelity
i
can
be
answerable
to
guard
the
entrances
of
the
palace
anna
smilingly
shook
her
head
no
said
she
nothing
of
all
that
shall
be
done
such
precautions
manifest
suspicion
and
would
wound
the
feelings
of
this
good
elizabeth
she
is
innocent
believe
me
i
yesterday
sharply
observed
her
and
she
came
out
from
the
trial
pure
it
would
be
ignoble
to
distrust
her
now
moreover
she
has
my
princely
word
that
i
will
always
listen
only
to
herself
and
believe
no
one
but
her
in
the
morning
i
will
go
to
her
and
show
her
this
letter
that
she
may
have
an
opportunity
to
justify
you
therefore
consider
her
wholly
innocent
asked
the
prince
with
a
sigh
yes
perfectly
innocent
her
firm
demeanor
her
asseverations
her
tears
have
convinced
me
that
it
was
unjust
in
us
to
believe
the
hateful
rumors
that
had
spread
concerning
her
let
us
therefore
retire
in
peace
and
quiet
no
danger
threatens
us
from
elizabeth
there
was
something
convincing
and
tranquillizing
in
anna
s
immovable
conviction
the
prince
felt
his
inability
to
oppose
her
and
was
ashamed
of
his
feminine
fears
in
the
face
of
her
masculine
intrepidity
with
a
sigh
he
took
his
leave
and
returned
to
his
own
room
at
the
door
he
turned
once
again
anna
said
he
with
solemnity
you
have
decided
upon
our
destiny
and
god
grant
that
it
may
eventuate
happily
but
should
it
be
otherwise
should
the
monstrous
and
terrible
break
in
upon
you
then
at
least
remember
this
hour
in
which
i
warned
you
and
confess
that
i
am
free
from
all
blame
without
awaiting
an
answer
with
a
drooping
head
and
deep
sigh
the
prince
left
the
room
anna
looked
after
him
with
a
compassionate
smile
poor
prince
she
murmured
low
he
is
always
so
timid
and
trembling
that
indicates
unhappiness
he
loves
me
and
i
can
not
force
my
heart
to
return
the
feeling
poor
prince
it
must
be
very
sad
to
love
and
be
unloved
with
a
sigh
she
closed
the
door
through
which
her
husband
had
passed
i
will
now
sleep
said
she
yes
sleep
possibly
heaven
may
send
me
a
pleasant
dream
and
i
may
see
my
lynar
but
no
i
must
first
go
to
ivan
to
ascertain
whether
his
slumber
is
with
hasty
steps
she
repaired
to
the
adjacent
chamber
which
was
that
of
the
young
emperor
there
all
was
still
before
the
door
opening
upon
the
corridor
she
heard
the
regular
step
of
the
soldier
on
guard
the
waiters
upon
the
emperor
were
slumbering
upon
mattresses
around
him
it
was
a
picture
of
profound
tranquillity
with
light
steps
anna
approached
the
cradle
of
her
son
and
bending
down
over
him
regarded
him
with
tender
maternal
glances
while
his
still
and
peaceful
slumber
seemed
to
touch
her
heart
with
a
sweet
emotion
sleep
my
dear
child
my
charming
little
emperor
she
murmured
sleep
and
in
your
dreams
may
you
play
with
angels
as
beautiful
as
yourself
bending
again
over
the
cradle
she
breathed
a
light
kiss
upon
the
rosy
lips
of
her
child
and
then
noiselessly
returned
to
her
own
chamber
and
now
said
she
drawing
a
long
breath
now
will
i
also
sleep
and
dream
my
beloved
lynar
with
a
happy
smile
she
reclined
upon
her
couch
and
soon
slumbered
at
this
moment
the
clock
in
the
next
chamber
struck
the
twelfth
hour
slowly
and
solemnly
resounded
the
tones
of
the
striking
clocks
that
announced
the
midnight
at
this
same
hour
a
lively
movement
commenced
in
the
palace
of
the
princess
elizabeth
lights
were
seen
glancing
from
window
to
window
hurrying
shadows
were
seen
coming
and
going
in
the
rooms
every
thing
there
announced
an
activity
unusual
for
the
hour
and
certainly
it
was
a
signal
good
fortune
for
elizabeth
that
anna
had
forbidden
her
husband
s
sending
a
patrol
through
the
streets
one
single
patrol
passing
the
palace
might
have
frustrated
the
whole
conspiracy
but
the
streets
were
perfectly
quiet
nowhere
was
a
sentinel
or
watchman
to
be
seen
the
slight
creaking
and
whizzing
of
a
sledge
upon
the
crackling
snow
was
now
heard
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
palace
gate
the
porter
opened
and
two
sledges
drove
into
the
court
the
first
with
a
rich
covering
and
magnificent
ornaments
was
empty
but
lestocq
was
seen
to
spring
out
of
the
second
and
hurriedly
enter
the
palace
elizabeth
splendidly
dressed
sparkling
with
brilliants
was
waiting
in
her
small
no
one
but
alexis
razumovsky
was
with
her
neither
of
them
spoke
and
their
visages
plainly
discovered
that
they
were
in
a
state
of
painfully
uncomfortable
suspense
elizabeth
was
pale
and
had
a
convulsive
twitching
about
her
mouth
her
form
trembled
feverishly
and
she
was
obliged
to
cling
to
razumovsky
to
prevent
falling
did
you
hear
the
opening
of
the
gate
she
breathed
low
lestocq
is
not
yet
here
and
it
is
past
midnight
certainly
he
is
arrested
all
is
discovered
and
we
are
lost
i
am
fearfully
anxious
alexis
i
already
seem
to
feel
the
sword
at
my
throat
ah
hear
you
not
steps
in
the
corridor
they
come
this
way
they
are
my
pursuers
they
come
to
conduct
me
to
the
scaffold
save
me
alexis
save
me
and
with
a
shrill
cry
of
anguish
the
princess
clung
to
the
neck
of
her
favorite
the
door
was
now
hastily
opened
and
upon
the
threshold
appeared
lestocq
and
woronzow
princess
elizabeth
exclaimed
lestocq
with
solemnity
i
have
come
for
you
the
throne
awaits
its
empress
up
princess
elizabeth
said
alexis
take
courage
my
fair
empress
give
us
an
example
of
spirit
and
resolution
the
princess
slowly
raised
her
pale
face
from
razumovsky
s
shoulder
and
looking
around
with
timid
glances
faintly
said
i
suffer
fearfully
this
anguish
will
kill
me
my
destiny
is
so
cruel
i
am
so
tormented
why
must
i
be
an
empress
that
you
may
be
no
nun
laconically
responded
lestocq
and
to
become
the
greatest
and
loftiest
woman
in
the
world
said
woronzow
to
raise
to
your
own
elevation
the
man
you
love
whispered
alexis
with
a
glance
of
tenderness
elizabeth
nodded
to
him
yes
said
she
for
your
sake
my
alexis
i
will
become
an
empress
come
let
us
go
but
where
is
grunstein
with
his
faithful
followers
he
awaits
us
before
the
casern
of
his
regiment
we
go
there
then
let
us
go
said
elizabeth
striding
forward
but
she
stopped
on
seeing
that
alexis
followed
with
the
other
two
no
said
she
you
must
not
go
with
us
alexis
if
i
am
to
have
courage
to
act
and
speak
i
must
know
that
you
are
not
mingled
in
the
strife
i
must
not
have
to
tremble
for
your
life
no
no
only
when
i
know
that
you
are
concealed
and
in
safety
can
i
have
courage
to
struggle
for
an
imperial
crown
promise
me
therefore
alexis
that
you
will
quietly
remain
here
until
i
send
a
messenger
for
you
razumovsky
begged
and
implored
in
vain
in
vain
he
knelt
before
her
and
covered
her
hands
with
tears
and
kisses
elizabeth
remained
inflexible
and
as
alexis
yet
persisted
in
his
prayers
she
earnestly
and
proudly
said
alexis
razumovsky
i
command
you
to
remain
here
you
will
obey
the
first
command
of
your
empress
i
will
remain
sighed
alexis
and
the
world
will
point
the
finger
of
scorn
at
me
calling
me
a
coward
and
i
will
compel
the
world
to
honor
you
as
a
king
said
elizabeth
with
tenderness
beckoning
to
lestocq
and
woronzow
to
follow
her
from
the
room
silently
they
hastened
down
the
stairs
silently
was
elizabeth
handed
into
her
sledge
while
lestocq
and
woronzow
took
their
places
in
the
second
forward
thundered
lestocq
s
powerful
voice
and
the
train
rushed
through
the
dark
and
deserted
streets
petersburg
slept
no
one
appeared
at
the
darkened
windows
of
the
silent
palaces
no
one
boded
that
a
new
empress
was
passing
through
the
streets
an
empress
who
at
this
time
had
but
two
subjects
in
her
train
they
had
now
reached
the
casern
of
the
peobrajensky
regiment
there
they
halted
in
the
open
door
stands
grunstein
with
his
thirty
recruits
they
silently
approached
the
sledge
of
the
princess
and
prostrated
themselves
before
her
hail
to
our
empress
whispered
grunstein
low
and
as
low
was
it
repeated
by
the
soldiers
let
us
enter
the
casern
call
the
soldiers
and
awaken
the
officers
i
myself
will
address
them
said
elizabeth
alighting
from
her
sledge
she
was
now
full
of
courage
and
resolution
in
the
face
of
danger
now
no
longer
to
be
avoided
she
had
suddenly
steeled
her
heart
her
father
s
spirit
was
awakened
in
her
with
a
firm
step
she
entered
the
casern
the
conspirators
had
already
raised
an
alarm
there
and
the
suddenly
aroused
soldiers
rushed
from
all
the
corridors
with
wonder
and
admiration
staring
at
this
noble
and
beautiful
woman
who
radiant
in
the
splendor
of
her
beauty
and
sparkling
with
jewels
stood
in
their
midst
soldiers
cried
elizabeth
with
a
firm
voice
i
come
to
implore
your
support
in
my
attempt
to
obtain
justice
in
the
realm
of
my
father
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
great
emperor
peter
the
rightful
heir
to
the
throne
of
russia
and
i
claim
what
is
mine
i
will
no
longer
suffer
a
german
princess
to
give
laws
to
you
my
beloved
brethren
and
countrymen
follow
me
therefore
and
let
us
drive
away
these
foreign
intruders
who
have
usurped
the
throne
of
your
lawful
sovereign
all
hail
elizabeth
our
empress
cried
the
conspirators
prostrating
themselves
surprised
benumbed
and
overpowered
the
others
made
no
opposition
miserable
slaves
they
were
accustomed
to
obey
whoever
dared
assume
the
command
over
them
and
they
therefore
submitted
falling
upon
their
knees
they
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
new
empress
elizabeth
was
now
the
empress
of
three
hundred
soldiers
up
now
my
friends
to
the
palace
of
the
czar
where
these
usurpers
dwell
and
inflict
upon
you
the
shame
of
calling
a
cradled
infant
your
emperor
come
and
let
us
punish
them
for
this
insult
by
thrusting
them
from
their
usurped
power
we
will
follow
our
empress
in
life
and
death
cried
the
soldiers
they
therefore
started
again
and
once
more
hastened
through
the
silent
streets
until
at
length
they
reached
the
imperial
palace
where
dwelt
the
emperor
ivan
with
his
parents
elizabeth
with
her
confidential
partisans
in
four
sledges
had
hastened
on
in
advance
of
the
others
with
renewed
courage
they
approached
the
principal
entrance
of
the
palace
the
guard
took
to
their
arms
and
the
drummer
was
preparing
to
beat
an
alarm
when
a
single
blow
of
lestocq
s
fist
broke
through
the
skin
of
the
drum
the
terrified
drummer
fell
and
over
his
body
passed
the
band
of
conspirators
elizabeth
at
their
head
no
one
ventured
to
oppose
them
the
slaves
fell
upon
their
knees
in
homage
to
her
who
announced
herself
as
their
mistress
and
empress
thus
meeting
with
universal
submission
and
obedience
they
approached
the
wing
of
the
palace
occupied
by
the
emperor
ivan
and
his
mother
the
regent
here
is
stationed
an
officer
of
the
guard
he
alone
ventures
defiance
to
the
intruders
he
meets
them
with
his
sword
drawn
and
swears
to
strike
down
the
first
person
who
attempts
to
enter
the
corridor
unhappy
man
what
is
it
you
dare
said
lestocq
boldly
advancing
you
are
guilty
of
fall
upon
your
knees
and
implore
pardon
of
your
empress
elizabeth
the
officer
shrank
bank
in
terror
it
was
an
empress
who
stood
before
him
and
he
had
dared
to
defy
her
begging
forgiveness
and
mercy
he
dropped
his
sword
and
fell
upon
his
knees
the
russian
slave
was
awakened
in
him
and
he
bent
before
the
one
who
had
the
power
to
command
unobstructed
retained
by
no
one
elizabeth
and
her
followers
now
strode
through
the
corridor
leading
to
the
private
apartments
of
the
regent
sentinels
were
placed
at
every
door
with
strict
commands
to
strike
down
any
one
who
should
dare
to
oppose
them
in
this
manner
they
reached
the
anteroom
of
the
regent
s
chamber
elizabeth
had
not
the
courage
to
go
any
farther
she
hesitatingly
stopped
a
deep
shame
and
repentance
came
over
her
when
she
thought
of
the
noble
confidence
anna
had
shown
and
which
she
was
now
on
the
point
of
repaying
with
the
blackest
treason
lestocq
whose
sharp
observing
glances
constantly
rested
upon
her
divined
her
thoughts
and
the
cause
of
her
irresolution
he
privately
whispered
some
words
to
grunstein
who
with
thirty
grenadiers
immediately
approached
the
door
of
anna
s
with
a
single
push
the
door
was
forced
and
with
a
wild
cry
the
soldiers
rushed
to
the
couch
upon
which
anna
leopoldowna
was
reposing
with
a
cry
of
anguish
anna
springs
up
from
her
slumber
and
shudderingly
stares
at
the
soldiers
by
whom
she
is
encompassed
who
with
rough
voices
command
her
to
rise
and
follow
them
they
scarcely
give
her
time
to
put
on
a
robe
and
encase
her
little
feet
in
shoes
but
anna
has
become
perfectly
calm
and
she
knows
she
is
lost
and
too
proud
to
weep
or
complain
she
finds
in
herself
courage
to
be
tranquil
i
beg
only
to
be
allowed
to
speak
to
elizabeth
said
she
aloud
i
will
do
all
you
command
me
i
will
follow
you
wherever
you
wish
only
let
me
first
see
your
empress
elizabeth
leaning
against
the
had
heard
these
words
yielding
to
an
involuntary
impulse
of
her
heart
she
pushed
open
the
door
and
appeared
upon
the
threshold
of
anna
leopoldowna
s
chamber
on
perceiving
her
a
faint
smile
passed
over
anna
s
features
ah
come
you
thus
to
me
elizabeth
she
said
reproachfully
with
a
proud
glance
at
the
princess
elizabeth
could
not
support
that
glance
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
again
anna
leopoldowna
smiled
she
was
conquered
but
before
her
blushing
with
shame
stood
her
momentarily
subdued
conqueror
but
anna
now
remembered
her
son
and
folding
her
hands
she
said
in
an
imploring
tone
elizabeth
kill
not
my
son
have
compassion
upon
him
elizabeth
turned
away
with
a
shudder
she
felt
her
heart
rent
she
had
not
strength
for
an
answer
lestocq
beckoned
the
soldiers
and
commanded
them
to
remove
the
traitress
anna
leopoldowna
thirty
warriors
took
possession
of
the
regent
who
calmly
and
proudly
submitted
herself
to
them
and
suffered
herself
to
be
led
away
in
the
corridor
they
encountered
another
troop
of
soldiers
who
were
escorting
the
regent
s
husband
prince
ulrich
of
brunswick
and
anna
s
favorite
julia
von
mengden
anna
sorrowfully
exclaimed
the
prince
oh
had
you
but
listened
to
my
warning
why
did
i
not
in
spite
of
your
commands
what
i
ought
to
have
done
i
alone
am
to
blame
for
this
sad
it
is
no
one
s
fault
but
mine
calmly
responded
anna
pardon
me
my
husband
pardon
me
and
so
they
descended
to
the
sledges
in
waiting
below
they
placed
the
prince
in
one
and
the
regent
with
julia
in
the
other
ah
said
julia
throwing
her
arms
around
anna
s
neck
we
shall
at
least
suffer
anna
reclined
her
head
upon
her
friend
s
shoulder
god
is
just
and
good
said
she
he
punishes
me
for
my
criminal
love
and
mercifully
spares
the
object
of
my
affections
i
thank
god
for
my
sufferings
julia
should
you
one
day
be
liberated
and
allowed
to
see
him
again
then
bear
to
him
my
warmest
greetings
then
tell
him
that
i
shall
love
him
eternally
and
that
my
last
sigh
shall
be
a
prayer
for
his
happiness
i
shall
never
see
him
again
bear
to
him
my
blessing
julia
julia
dissolved
in
tears
and
clinging
to
her
friend
she
sobbed
no
no
they
will
not
dare
to
kill
then
they
will
condemn
me
to
a
imprisonment
calmly
responded
anna
no
no
your
head
is
sacred
and
so
is
your
freedom
they
dare
not
attack
nothing
is
sacred
in
russia
laconically
responded
anna
the
sledges
stopped
at
the
palace
of
the
princess
elizabeth
hardly
two
hours
had
passed
since
elizabeth
in
those
same
sledges
had
left
her
palace
as
a
poor
trembling
princess
and
now
as
reigning
empress
she
sent
them
back
to
the
dethroned
regent
the
latter
entered
the
palace
of
the
princess
as
a
prisoner
while
elizabeth
as
empress
took
possession
of
the
palace
of
the
czars
the
sleep
of
innocence
anna
leopoldowna
had
hardly
left
the
room
in
which
she
had
been
surprised
and
captured
when
lestocq
turned
to
grunstein
with
a
new
order
now
said
he
in
an
undertone
to
him
now
hasten
to
seize
the
emperor
this
little
ivan
must
be
elizabeth
had
overheard
these
words
and
remembering
anna
s
last
prayer
she
exclaimed
with
vehemence
no
no
i
say
he
shall
not
be
annihilated
woe
to
him
who
injures
a
hair
of
his
head
i
will
not
be
the
murderer
of
an
innocent
child
take
him
prisoner
get
him
in
your
power
but
in
him
respect
the
child
and
the
emperor
tear
him
not
forcibly
from
his
slumber
but
protect
his
sleep
poor
child
destined
to
suffer
so
early
no
weakness
now
princess
whispered
lestocq
show
yourself
great
and
firm
else
all
is
lost
come
away
from
here
that
the
sight
of
this
child
may
not
yet
more
enfeeble
your
heart
come
much
more
remains
to
be
and
reverently
taking
elizabeth
s
hand
he
led
her
to
the
door
now
do
your
duty
said
he
to
grunstein
seize
young
but
remember
my
command
and
spare
him
said
elizabeth
slowly
and
hesitatingly
leaving
the
chamber
now
to
ivan
grunstein
commanded
his
soldiers
and
with
them
he
hastened
to
the
of
the
young
emperor
there
deep
stillness
and
undisturbed
peace
yet
prevailed
only
the
were
awakened
and
had
hastily
fled
in
search
of
concealment
and
safety
they
had
left
the
young
emperor
entirely
alone
and
he
had
not
been
awakened
by
the
disturbance
all
around
him
he
lay
quietly
in
his
splendid
cradle
which
was
placed
upon
a
sort
of
estrade
in
the
centre
of
the
room
dimly
lighted
by
a
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
by
golden
chains
this
slumbering
smiling
childish
face
peeping
forth
from
the
green
silk
coverings
of
the
pillows
resembled
a
fresh
bursting
rosebud
it
was
a
sight
that
inspired
respect
even
in
those
rough
soldiers
devoutly
staring
they
at
first
remained
at
the
door
of
the
room
then
slowly
and
stepping
on
the
points
of
their
toes
they
approached
nearer
and
surrounded
the
cradle
but
remembering
the
words
of
their
new
empress
spare
his
sleep
no
one
dared
to
touch
the
child
or
awaken
him
from
his
slumber
in
close
order
the
bearded
warriors
pressed
around
the
cradle
of
the
imperial
child
leaning
upon
their
halberds
watching
for
his
awaking
it
was
a
rare
and
admirable
picture
in
the
centre
upon
its
estrade
was
the
splendid
cradle
of
the
slumbering
child
and
all
around
upon
the
steps
of
this
these
soldiers
with
their
wild
and
threatening
faces
all
eyes
expectantly
resting
upon
the
smiling
infantile
brow
the
door
now
opened
and
her
face
pallid
with
terror
ivan
s
nurse
rushed
into
the
room
and
to
the
cradle
of
her
imperial
nursling
the
soldiers
with
imperious
glances
beckoned
her
to
await
in
silence
like
themselves
the
awakening
of
the
emperor
the
poor
woman
spoke
not
but
her
tears
indicated
the
depth
of
her
grief
time
passes
as
if
under
enchantment
earnest
immovable
silent
stand
the
soldiers
behind
the
cradle
her
eyes
and
arms
raised
imploringly
toward
heaven
stands
the
nurse
while
the
child
continues
to
slumber
smiling
in
its
sleep
at
the
expiration
of
an
hour
thus
passed
the
imperial
infant
moves
throws
up
its
little
rosy
arms
opens
its
eyes
it
is
awake
a
cry
of
triumph
escapes
the
lips
of
all
the
soldiers
all
arms
were
stretched
forth
to
seize
him
who
an
hour
before
had
been
their
lord
and
emperor
the
child
frightened
by
the
aspect
of
these
rough
soldiers
bursts
out
into
a
cry
of
alarm
and
stretches
out
its
little
arms
toward
its
nurse
she
takes
him
in
her
arms
and
weeps
over
him
the
frightened
child
buries
its
little
face
in
the
bosom
of
his
nurse
and
the
soldiers
now
convey
them
both
to
the
waiting
sledges
the
dethroned
emperor
is
quickly
transported
to
the
dethroned
regent
at
elizabeth
s
palace
who
with
hot
tears
clasps
her
son
to
her
heart
the
recompensing
meanwhile
elizabeth
had
made
herself
absolute
mistress
of
the
imperial
palace
hastening
to
the
she
had
taken
possession
of
the
throne
of
her
father
and
administered
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
guards
surrounding
her
they
lay
upon
their
knees
before
her
these
cowardly
instruments
of
despotism
they
bowed
their
heads
in
the
dust
and
these
four
or
five
thousand
slaves
to
which
number
the
followers
of
the
empress
already
amounted
swore
fealty
to
elizabeth
ready
to
strangle
the
regent
and
the
young
emperor
at
her
command
or
to
serve
her
the
same
if
peradventure
the
regent
should
regain
a
momentary
power
while
the
guards
were
doing
homage
in
the
palace
grunstein
and
woronzow
by
lestocq
s
command
led
their
men
to
munnich
s
and
ostermann
s
and
both
were
imprisoned
with
them
a
great
number
of
leading
and
suspected
persons
who
perhaps
might
have
been
disposed
to
draw
the
sword
for
anna
leopoldowna
lestocq
had
thought
of
every
thing
had
considered
every
thing
at
the
same
time
that
he
entered
the
regent
s
palace
with
elizabeth
he
sent
to
the
printer
the
manifesto
which
proclaimed
elizabeth
as
empress
with
the
appearance
of
the
sun
in
the
horizon
elizabeth
was
recognized
as
empress
in
the
capital
and
soon
after
throughout
the
whole
empire
who
were
they
who
recognized
her
it
was
not
the
people
for
in
russia
there
are
no
people
there
are
only
masters
and
slaves
elizabeth
had
become
empress
because
fortune
and
anna
leopoldowna
s
generous
confidence
had
favored
her
not
the
exigencies
of
the
people
nor
the
tyranny
of
her
predecessor
had
called
her
to
the
throne
but
she
had
attained
to
it
by
the
cunning
and
intrigues
of
some
few
confederates
she
had
become
empress
because
lestocq
was
tired
of
being
only
physician
to
a
poor
princess
because
grunstein
thought
the
position
of
was
far
too
humble
for
him
and
because
alexis
razumovsky
the
former
precentor
in
the
imperial
chapel
found
it
desirable
to
add
to
his
name
the
title
of
count
or
prince
when
petersburg
awoke
it
heard
with
astonishment
the
news
of
a
new
revolution
from
mouth
to
mouth
flew
this
astounding
announcement
we
have
changed
our
rulers
we
are
no
longer
the
servants
of
the
emperor
ivan
but
of
the
empress
elizabeth
a
new
dynasty
has
arisen
and
we
have
a
new
oath
of
allegiance
to
take
at
first
only
a
few
ventured
to
spread
this
extraordinary
intelligence
and
these
few
were
tremblingly
and
anxiously
avoided
it
was
dangerous
to
listen
to
them
people
fled
from
them
without
answering
but
as
the
rumors
became
constantly
louder
and
more
significant
as
at
length
their
truth
could
no
longer
be
doubted
as
it
became
certain
that
the
regent
and
her
son
were
dethroned
and
elizabeth
was
established
in
power
all
the
doubting
and
anxious
faces
were
as
by
an
electric
spark
lighted
up
with
joy
then
nothing
was
heard
but
the
cry
of
triumph
and
jubilation
then
was
anna
leopoldowna
loudly
cursed
by
those
who
had
blessed
her
on
the
preceding
day
then
was
the
new
empress
elizabeth
loudly
lauded
by
those
who
yesterday
had
smiled
with
contempt
at
her
powerlessness
all
again
hastened
to
the
imperial
palace
the
great
and
the
noble
again
brought
out
their
state
coaches
for
the
purpose
of
throwing
themselves
at
the
feet
of
the
new
possessor
of
power
and
swearing
a
new
allegiance
again
nothing
was
heard
but
the
sound
of
universal
rejoicing
nothing
seen
but
faces
lighted
up
by
ecstasy
and
eyes
glistening
with
tears
of
joy
and
this
was
in
fourteen
months
the
third
time
that
they
had
done
homage
to
a
new
ruler
who
had
as
regularly
dethroned
his
predecessor
and
they
had
each
time
gone
through
the
same
ceremony
with
the
same
evidences
of
joy
the
same
ecstasies
the
same
slavish
humility
not
commiserating
the
defeated
party
but
professing
love
and
devotion
to
the
victor
and
as
the
day
dawned
on
petersburg
as
it
gloriously
beamed
upon
the
young
empress
as
she
saw
these
thousands
of
worshipping
slaves
at
her
feet
elizabeth
s
heart
swelled
with
a
proud
joy
and
looking
down
upon
the
masses
of
humble
and
devoted
subjects
whose
mistress
she
was
she
felt
herself
momentarily
overcome
by
a
deep
and
holy
emotion
i
will
be
a
mother
to
this
people
thought
she
i
will
love
and
spare
them
i
will
govern
them
with
mildness
they
shall
not
curse
but
adore
me
yielding
to
this
first
generous
impulse
of
her
heart
elizabeth
rose
from
the
throne
and
with
uplifted
hands
loudly
and
solemnly
swore
that
she
would
be
a
mother
to
her
subjects
a
mother
who
when
compelled
to
punish
would
never
forget
love
and
forbearance
no
one
however
great
his
crime
said
she
with
flashing
eyes
no
one
shall
be
punished
with
death
so
long
as
i
sit
upon
this
throne
from
this
day
the
punishment
of
death
is
abolished
in
my
realm
i
will
punish
crime
but
i
will
spare
the
life
of
the
criminal
when
elizabeth
had
thus
spoken
the
large
hall
again
resounded
with
the
rejoicing
shouts
of
the
great
and
noble
men
breathed
freer
and
deeper
they
raised
their
heads
more
proudly
for
centuries
the
word
of
the
czars
had
swept
over
the
heads
of
russians
like
the
sword
of
damocles
it
now
seemed
to
be
removed
and
to
promise
to
each
one
a
longer
life
a
longer
unendangered
existence
for
where
was
there
a
subject
of
the
czars
who
might
not
at
any
time
be
convicted
of
a
crime
where
an
innocent
person
who
might
not
at
any
moment
be
condemned
to
death
a
glance
a
smile
an
inconsiderate
word
had
often
sufficed
to
cause
a
head
to
fall
and
now
this
eternally
present
danger
seemed
to
be
removed
what
wonder
then
that
they
raised
shouts
of
joy
that
they
embraced
each
other
that
they
loudly
and
solemnly
called
down
the
blessings
of
heaven
upon
this
noble
and
merciful
empress
during
this
time
of
general
rejoicing
among
the
great
and
noble
of
the
realm
in
the
brilliant
imperial
halls
above
the
palace
was
surrounded
by
dense
masses
of
people
looking
up
with
curiosity
at
the
bright
windows
and
listening
with
astonishment
to
the
joyful
shouts
that
reached
their
ears
below
and
when
they
heard
the
cause
of
the
rejoicing
above
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
murmured
low
the
empress
will
henceforth
punish
no
one
with
death
what
is
that
to
us
that
the
great
shall
no
more
be
put
to
death
by
the
empress
is
no
concern
of
ours
the
serfs
of
the
great
the
empress
is
powerful
but
our
lords
and
masters
have
yet
more
power
over
us
they
will
still
scourge
us
to
death
and
the
empress
can
not
hinder
them
that
a
word
of
authority
from
the
czarina
had
abolished
the
punishment
of
death
did
not
stir
them
up
from
their
dull
expectant
silence
but
when
a
messenger
from
the
empress
came
and
announced
that
elizabeth
had
ordered
a
flask
of
brandy
to
be
given
to
each
one
of
the
crowd
assembled
below
that
they
might
drink
her
health
then
came
life
and
movement
to
these
stupid
masses
then
their
dull
faces
were
distorted
into
a
friendly
grin
then
they
screamed
and
howled
with
a
brutish
ecstasy
and
they
all
rushed
to
the
opened
door
to
avail
themselves
of
the
promised
benevolence
of
the
empress
and
receive
the
divine
liquor
for
the
great
the
abolition
of
capital
punishment
for
the
people
a
flask
of
brandy
these
were
the
first
rays
that
announced
the
appearance
of
the
sun
elizabeth
in
the
horizon
of
her
realm
no
elizabeth
did
yet
more
in
this
hour
she
remembered
with
a
grateful
heart
the
faithful
friends
who
had
assisted
her
to
the
throne
to
reward
these
was
her
next
and
most
sacred
duty
a
nod
from
her
called
to
her
presence
the
thirty
grenadiers
of
the
preobrajensky
regiment
whom
grunstein
had
won
over
and
the
empress
with
a
gracious
smile
gave
them
her
hand
to
kiss
then
rising
from
her
throne
and
glancing
at
the
assembled
magnates
and
princes
she
said
in
a
clear
and
flattering
tone
it
is
service
that
ennobles
it
is
fidelity
that
lends
fame
and
splendor
and
service
and
fidelity
have
you
rendered
and
shown
to
me
my
faithful
grenadiers
i
will
reward
you
as
you
deserve
from
this
hour
you
are
free
nay
more
you
are
magnates
of
my
realm
you
belong
with
the
best
of
right
to
their
circle
for
in
virtue
of
my
imperial
power
i
raise
you
to
the
nobility
by
creating
you
barons
all
of
you
my
thirty
faithful
grenadiers
and
you
grunstein
the
leader
of
this
faithful
band
receive
them
into
your
ranks
my
counts
and
barons
they
are
worthy
of
you
hesitating
not
daring
to
mingle
with
those
proud
magnates
stood
the
new
barons
but
the
princes
and
counts
advanced
to
them
with
open
arms
with
exclamations
of
tenderness
and
assurances
of
friendship
the
empress
had
spoken
the
slaves
must
obey
and
these
princes
and
counts
these
generals
and
who
yesterday
would
hardly
have
thrown
away
a
contemptuous
glance
upon
these
grenadiers
now
called
them
friends
and
brothers
and
were
most
happy
to
admit
them
into
their
circle
elizabeth
gave
a
satisfied
glance
at
these
hearty
greetings
she
found
it
infinitely
sweet
and
agreeable
to
make
so
many
men
happy
in
so
easy
a
manner
and
with
pleasure
she
recollected
that
she
had
yet
to
reward
her
coachman
who
had
guided
her
sledge
in
the
great
and
decisive
hour
she
ordered
him
to
be
called
a
considerable
time
elapsed
and
all
were
looking
expectantly
toward
the
door
which
finally
opened
and
led
by
four
lackeys
the
coachman
stumbled
into
the
hall
they
had
had
some
trouble
in
finding
him
until
at
length
he
was
discovered
among
the
people
in
the
enjoying
the
brandy
distributed
by
order
of
the
empress
from
this
crowd
they
had
withdrawn
him
in
spite
of
his
resistance
in
order
to
bring
him
to
his
sovereign
she
received
the
staggering
petrovitch
with
a
gracious
smile
she
praised
the
dauntlessness
with
which
he
had
guided
her
sledge
in
that
eventful
night
and
in
gratitude
for
his
good
conduct
she
raised
him
as
she
had
the
grenadiers
to
the
rank
of
a
nobleman
by
naming
him
a
baron
of
the
russian
empire
petrovitch
listened
to
her
with
a
stupid
laugh
and
when
the
magnates
crowded
around
him
offering
their
hands
and
assuring
him
of
their
friendship
he
tremblingly
and
with
effort
stammered
some
unmeaning
words
and
falling
upon
his
knees
he
bowed
his
head
in
the
dust
before
these
great
and
powerful
magnates
humbly
kissing
the
hems
of
their
garments
not
suspecting
that
he
was
their
equal
in
rank
and
constantly
more
brilliant
and
beautiful
beamed
the
imperial
grace
none
of
elizabeth
s
faithful
friends
and
servants
were
forgotten
for
she
possessed
a
virtue
rare
among
princes
she
was
grateful
she
named
lestocq
her
first
physician
president
of
the
medical
college
and
member
of
her
privy
council
she
made
grunstein
an
imperial
with
the
rank
of
and
woronzow
a
count
and
her
first
chamberlain
then
at
last
she
repeated
the
name
of
her
friend
alexis
razumovsky
her
fair
brow
lighted
up
as
with
a
reflected
sunbeam
on
his
approaching
her
throne
and
holding
out
to
him
both
hands
she
said
aloud
alexis
razumovsky
i
have
you
most
to
thank
for
my
success
in
dispossessing
the
usurpers
who
have
robbed
me
of
my
father
s
throne
for
your
wise
counsels
gave
me
courage
and
force
be
then
henceforth
next
to
my
throne
my
chamberlain
count
razumovsky
bending
a
knee
before
her
alexis
gratefully
kissed
her
beloved
hand
and
the
counts
and
gentlemen
surrounded
him
loudly
praising
the
great
wisdom
of
the
empress
whose
divine
penetration
enabled
her
everywhere
to
discover
and
reward
true
service
ah
sighed
elizabeth
when
on
the
evening
of
this
glorious
day
she
was
again
alone
with
her
confidential
friends
ah
my
friends
i
have
now
complied
with
your
wishes
and
allowed
you
to
make
an
empress
of
me
but
forget
not
lestocq
that
i
have
become
empress
only
on
condition
that
i
am
not
to
be
troubled
with
business
and
state
affairs
this
has
been
a
day
of
great
exertion
and
fatigue
and
i
hope
you
will
henceforth
leave
me
in
repose
i
have
done
what
you
wished
i
am
empress
and
have
rewarded
you
for
your
aid
but
now
i
also
demand
my
reward
and
that
is
undisturbed
peace
once
for
all
in
my
private
apartments
no
one
is
to
speak
of
state
affairs
here
i
will
have
repose
you
can
carry
on
the
government
through
your
bureaux
and
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
here
we
will
be
gay
and
enjoy
life
come
here
my
alexis
come
here
and
tell
me
if
this
imperial
crown
is
becoming
and
whether
you
found
me
fair
in
my
purple
mantle
my
lofty
empress
is
always
the
fairest
of
women
tenderly
responded
alexis
call
me
not
empress
said
she
drawing
him
closer
to
her
that
brings
again
to
mind
all
the
hardships
and
wearinesses
i
have
this
day
only
yet
a
moment
your
majesty
let
me
remind
you
that
you
are
now
empress
and
as
such
have
duties
to
perform
pressingly
exclaimed
lestocq
you
have
this
day
exercised
the
pleasantest
right
of
your
imperial
power
the
right
of
rewarding
and
making
happy
but
there
remains
another
and
not
less
important
duty
your
majesty
must
now
think
of
punishing
the
regent
and
her
husband
and
son
are
prisoners
as
also
are
munnich
ostermann
count
lowenwald
and
julia
von
mengden
you
must
think
of
judging
and
punishing
elizabeth
had
paid
no
attention
to
him
she
was
whispering
and
laughing
with
alexis
who
had
let
down
her
long
dark
hair
and
was
now
playfully
twining
it
around
her
white
neck
ah
you
have
not
listened
to
me
your
majesty
impatiently
cried
lestocq
you
must
however
for
a
few
moments
remember
your
dignity
and
direct
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
imprisoned
only
see
alexis
how
this
new
lord
privy
counsellor
teases
me
sighed
the
princess
and
turning
to
lestocq
she
continued
i
think
you
should
understand
the
laws
better
than
i
and
should
know
how
traitors
are
in
all
countries
is
punished
with
death
said
lestocq
gloomily
well
let
these
traitors
fare
according
to
the
common
usage
and
kill
them
responded
elizabeth
comfortably
extending
herself
upon
the
divan
but
your
majesty
has
this
day
abolished
the
punishment
of
have
i
so
ah
yes
i
now
remember
well
as
i
have
said
it
i
must
keep
my
and
the
regent
prince
ulrich
the
emperor
ivan
counts
ostermann
munnich
lowenwald
as
well
as
julia
von
mengden
and
the
other
prisoners
are
all
to
remain
unpunished
can
they
be
punished
in
no
other
way
than
by
death
impatiently
asked
elizabeth
have
we
not
prisons
and
the
knout
have
we
not
siberia
and
the
rack
punish
these
traitors
then
as
you
think
best
i
give
you
full
powers
and
if
it
must
be
so
will
even
take
the
trouble
to
affix
my
signature
to
your
but
we
can
not
scourge
the
regent
or
her
son
no
said
elizabeth
with
vehemence
these
you
must
permit
to
go
free
and
without
hindrance
to
germany
your
judicial
powers
will
not
extend
to
them
it
shall
not
be
said
that
elizabeth
has
delivered
up
her
aunt
and
cousin
to
torture
for
the
purpose
of
securing
her
own
advantage
let
them
go
hence
free
and
unobstructed
i
tell
you
this
is
my
express
imperial
will
and
elizabeth
exhausted
by
so
great
an
effort
leaned
her
head
upon
the
shoulder
of
alexis
mechanically
playing
with
his
locks
and
munnich
and
ostermann
asked
lestocq
dieu
will
then
this
annoyance
never
cease
impatiently
exclaimed
the
empress
what
are
munnich
and
ostermann
to
me
i
know
them
not
they
have
never
injured
and
are
wholly
indifferent
to
me
do
with
them
as
you
and
your
colleagues
think
best
i
shall
not
trouble
myself
about
it
judge
condemn
punish
them
it
is
all
one
to
me
only
their
lives
must
be
spared
as
i
have
promised
that
no
one
shall
be
punished
with
i
may
then
announce
to
the
council
that
you
will
confirm
their
sentence
yes
yes
certainly
cried
elizabeth
springing
up
scourge
banish
them
do
what
you
please
but
leave
me
in
peace
come
my
alexis
this
good
lestocq
is
insufferable
he
will
annoy
us
to
death
if
we
remain
any
longer
here
come
we
will
escape
from
him
and
his
serious
face
oh
we
have
much
more
serious
subjects
of
conversation
is
my
grand
gala
dinner
and
we
have
my
toilet
to
examine
to
be
certain
that
every
thing
is
in
the
proper
order
and
then
the
ball
toilet
for
the
evening
which
is
far
more
important
i
shall
open
the
ball
with
a
you
promised
me
alexis
to
practice
with
me
the
new
tour
which
the
marquis
de
la
chetardie
describes
as
the
latest
parisian
mode
come
let
us
essay
this
tour
for
a
new
empress
at
her
first
court
ball
there
is
nothing
more
important
than
that
she
should
perform
her
duty
as
leader
of
the
dance
with
propriety
and
grace
quick
therefore
to
the
work
give
me
your
hand
and
now
alexis
let
us
commence
sing
a
melody
to
it
and
then
it
will
go
alexis
began
to
sing
a
and
taking
the
hand
of
the
empress
they
commenced
the
practice
of
the
new
tour
so
that
is
right
said
he
interrupting
his
singing
that
is
very
fine
now
let
go
my
hand
and
turn
proudly
and
majestically
around
beautifully
done
now
a
half
turn
sideward
one
two
three
la
la
la
tra
la
yet
one
more
question
interposed
lestocq
may
the
council
of
state
sit
in
judgment
upon
lowenwald
and
de
mengden
and
will
you
confirm
their
decision
one
two
three
tra
la
la
sang
alexis
and
the
empress
whirled
and
made
her
graceful
turn
as
he
had
taught
her
lestocq
repeated
his
question
to
the
empress
elizabeth
was
precisely
in
the
most
difficult
tour
yes
yes
she
breathlessly
cried
i
deliver
them
all
over
to
you
scourge
them
punish
them
send
them
to
siberia
whatever
you
think
best
halt
alexis
we
must
try
this
tour
over
again
but
indeed
i
think
i
shall
acquit
myself
very
well
in
heavenly
cried
alexis
once
more
then
one
two
three
la
la
la
tra
la
punishment
punish
them
all
all
had
elizabeth
said
but
the
regent
her
husband
and
her
son
them
you
will
permit
to
return
to
germany
we
must
accomplish
the
will
of
the
empress
and
therefore
let
them
go
we
will
obey
her
commands
said
lestocq
to
alexis
razumovsky
we
must
let
them
go
free
but
it
would
be
dangerous
to
let
them
ever
reach
germany
with
their
persons
they
would
preserve
their
rights
and
their
claims
and
elizabeth
would
always
stand
in
fear
of
this
regent
and
this
young
growing
emperor
whose
claims
to
the
imperial
russian
crown
are
incontestable
you
alone
razumovsky
can
turn
away
this
danger
from
the
head
of
the
empress
by
convincing
her
of
its
reality
and
inducing
her
to
change
her
mind
reflect
that
the
safety
of
the
empress
is
our
own
reflect
that
as
we
have
risen
with
her
so
shall
we
fall
with
her
rely
upon
me
said
alexis
with
a
confident
smile
this
regent
and
her
young
emperor
ivan
shall
never
pass
the
russian
boundary
let
them
now
go
but
send
a
strong
guard
with
them
and
travel
by
slow
marches
that
our
couriers
may
be
able
to
overtake
them
at
a
later
period
that
is
all
you
have
to
do
in
the
and
humming
a
sentimental
song
alexis
repaired
to
the
apartments
of
the
empress
before
the
back
door
of
the
palace
elizabeth
had
occupied
as
princess
a
was
waiting
gayly
sounded
and
clattered
the
bells
on
the
six
small
horses
attached
to
the
sledge
gayly
did
the
postilions
blow
their
horns
and
with
enticing
calls
resounded
the
thundering
through
the
cold
winter
air
to
those
for
whom
this
sledge
was
destined
this
call
sounded
like
a
greeting
from
heaven
it
was
to
them
the
dove
with
the
announcing
to
them
the
end
of
their
torments
it
was
the
messenger
of
peace
which
gave
them
back
their
freedom
their
lives
and
perhaps
even
happiness
they
were
to
return
to
germany
their
home
hastening
through
the
russian
they
would
soon
reach
a
softer
climate
where
they
would
be
surrounded
by
milder
manners
and
customs
what
was
it
to
anna
that
she
was
to
be
deprived
of
earthly
elevation
and
power
what
cared
she
that
she
henceforth
would
no
more
have
the
pleasure
of
commanding
others
she
was
free
free
from
the
task
of
ruling
slaves
and
humanizing
barbarians
free
from
the
constraint
of
greatness
and
finally
free
to
live
in
conformity
with
her
own
inclinations
and
perhaps
ah
perhaps
to
found
a
happiness
the
bare
dreaming
of
which
already
caused
her
heart
to
tremble
with
unspeakable
ecstasy
again
and
again
the
resounded
without
anna
weeping
tore
herself
from
the
arms
of
julia
she
had
in
vain
implored
the
favor
of
taking
julia
von
mengden
with
her
elizabeth
had
refused
it
and
in
this
refusal
she
had
pronounced
the
sentence
of
the
favorite
this
was
understood
by
both
julia
and
anna
they
held
each
other
in
a
last
embrace
anna
wept
hot
tears
but
julia
remained
calm
and
even
smiled
they
may
send
me
to
siberia
if
they
please
my
heart
will
remain
warm
under
the
coldness
of
the
siberian
climate
and
this
great
happiness
of
knowing
that
you
and
yours
are
saved
they
can
not
rend
from
me
that
will
be
for
me
a
talisman
against
all
misfortunes
but
i
sadly
responded
anna
shall
i
not
always
be
tortured
by
the
reflection
that
it
is
i
who
have
been
the
cause
of
your
misfortunes
are
you
not
condemned
because
you
loved
and
were
true
to
me
ah
does
love
then
deserve
so
hard
a
punishment
the
punishment
passes
but
love
remains
calmly
responded
julia
that
will
always
be
my
and
mine
also
sighed
anna
you
will
not
need
it
said
julia
with
a
smile
you
at
least
will
be
anna
sighed
again
and
her
cheek
paled
a
dark
and
terrible
image
arose
in
her
soul
and
she
shudderingly
whispered
ah
would
that
we
were
once
beyond
the
russian
boundary
for
then
first
shall
we
be
then
let
us
hasten
our
journey
said
prince
ulrich
once
in
the
sledge
and
every
minute
brings
us
nearer
to
freedom
and
happiness
only
hear
how
the
horns
are
calling
us
anna
they
call
us
to
germany
come
take
your
son
wrap
him
close
in
your
furred
mantle
and
let
us
hasten
away
away
from
here
the
prince
laid
little
ivan
in
the
arms
of
his
wife
and
drew
her
away
with
him
farewell
farewell
my
julia
cried
anna
as
she
took
he
seat
in
the
sledge
farewell
was
echoed
as
a
low
from
the
palace
shuddering
anna
pressed
her
child
to
her
bosom
and
cast
an
anxiously
interrogating
glance
at
her
husband
who
was
sitting
by
her
be
calm
tranquillize
yourself
it
will
all
be
well
said
the
latter
with
a
smile
the
postilion
blew
his
horn
the
horses
started
gayly
resounded
the
tones
of
the
silver
bells
with
a
light
whizzing
away
flew
the
sledge
over
the
snow
it
bore
thence
a
dethroned
emperor
and
his
overthrown
family
rapidly
did
this
sledge
pass
through
the
streets
but
following
it
was
a
troop
of
armed
soldiers
like
unwholesome
ravens
following
their
certain
booty
at
about
the
same
hour
another
armed
troop
passed
through
the
streets
of
petersburg
with
drawn
swords
they
surrounded
two
sledges
the
mysterious
occupants
of
which
no
one
was
allowed
to
descry
the
train
made
a
halt
at
the
same
gate
through
which
the
overthrown
imperial
family
had
just
passed
the
soldiers
surrounded
the
sledges
in
close
ranks
no
one
was
allowed
a
glimpse
at
those
who
alighted
from
them
but
these
extra
precautions
of
the
soldiery
were
unnecessary
as
nobody
wished
to
see
the
unfortunate
objects
every
one
timidly
glanced
aside
that
they
might
not
by
looking
at
the
poor
creatures
bring
themselves
into
suspicion
of
favoring
men
suffering
under
the
displeasure
of
the
government
but
though
they
looked
not
at
them
every
one
knew
who
they
were
though
they
dared
not
speak
to
each
other
every
one
tremblingly
said
to
himself
there
go
munnich
and
ostermann
to
their
trials
munnich
and
ostermann
the
faithful
servants
of
peter
the
great
munnich
whom
prince
eugene
called
his
beloved
pupil
ostermann
of
whom
the
dying
czar
peter
said
he
had
never
caught
him
in
a
fault
that
he
was
the
only
honest
statesman
in
russia
munnich
and
ostermann
those
two
great
statesmen
to
whom
russia
was
chiefly
indebted
for
what
civilization
and
cultivation
she
had
acquired
were
now
accused
of
and
sent
for
trial
before
a
commission
commanded
to
find
them
guilty
and
to
punish
them
they
were
to
be
put
out
of
the
way
because
they
were
feared
and
to
be
feared
was
held
as
a
crime
deserving
death
firm
and
outrageous
stood
they
before
their
judges
in
this
hour
old
ostermann
had
shaken
off
his
illness
and
thrown
away
the
shield
of
his
physical
sufferings
he
would
not
intrench
himself
behind
his
age
and
his
sickness
he
would
be
a
man
and
boldly
offer
his
unprotected
breast
to
the
murderous
weapons
of
his
enemies
for
that
he
was
lost
he
knew
a
single
glance
at
his
judges
made
him
certain
of
it
and
from
this
moment
his
features
wore
a
calm
and
contemptuous
smile
an
unchangeable
expression
of
scorn
with
an
ironic
curiosity
he
followed
his
judges
through
the
labyrinth
of
artfully
contrived
captious
questions
by
which
they
hoped
to
entangle
him
occasionally
he
gave
himself
as
it
were
for
his
own
amusement
the
appearance
of
voluntarily
being
caught
in
their
nets
until
he
finally
by
a
side
spring
tore
their
whole
web
to
pieces
and
laughingly
derided
his
judges
for
not
being
able
to
convict
him
he
was
accused
of
having
by
his
cabals
alone
after
the
death
of
catharine
effected
the
elevation
to
the
throne
of
anna
duchess
of
courland
and
yet
they
very
well
knew
that
precisely
at
that
time
ostermann
had
for
weeks
pretended
to
be
suffering
from
illness
for
the
very
purpose
of
avoiding
any
intermingling
with
state
affairs
they
accused
him
of
having
suppressed
the
testament
of
catharine
and
yet
that
testament
had
been
published
in
all
the
official
journals
of
the
time
ostermann
laughed
loud
at
all
of
these
childish
accusations
ah
said
he
should
i
be
sitting
in
your
places
and
you
all
though
innocent
should
be
standing
accused
before
me
my
word
for
it
i
would
so
involve
you
in
questions
and
answers
that
you
would
be
compelled
to
confess
your
guilt
but
you
do
not
understand
questioning
and
old
ostermann
is
a
sly
fox
that
does
not
allow
himself
to
be
easily
caught
the
best
way
will
be
for
you
to
declare
me
guilty
though
i
am
no
criminal
for
as
your
empress
has
commanded
that
i
should
be
found
guilty
it
would
certainly
be
in
me
a
crime
worthy
of
death
not
to
be
you
dare
to
deride
our
empress
cried
one
of
the
judges
aha
said
ostermann
laughing
i
have
there
thrown
you
a
bait
and
you
good
judicial
fishes
bite
directly
that
is
very
well
you
are
now
in
a
good
way
only
go
on
and
i
will
help
you
to
find
me
guilty
if
it
be
only
of
simple
it
will
then
be
left
to
the
mercy
of
your
empress
to
declare
me
convicted
of
threefold
go
on
go
on
but
munnich
showed
himself
less
unruffled
and
sarcastic
in
the
face
of
his
judges
these
questions
this
ceaseless
teasing
about
trifles
exhausted
his
patience
at
last
he
wearied
of
continually
turning
aside
these
laughably
trivial
accusations
of
convincing
his
judges
of
his
innocence
and
making
them
ashamed
of
the
nature
of
the
proofs
adduced
let
it
suffice
said
he
at
length
to
his
judges
after
hours
of
vain
labor
you
see
that
in
this
way
you
will
never
attain
your
end
i
will
propose
to
you
a
better
and
safer
course
write
down
your
questions
and
append
to
each
the
answer
you
desire
me
to
give
i
will
then
sign
the
whole
protocol
and
declare
it
are
you
in
earnest
joyfully
asked
the
judges
quite
in
earnest
proudly
answered
munnich
they
were
shameless
enough
to
accept
his
offer
they
troubled
him
with
no
more
questions
but
wrote
in
the
protocol
such
answers
as
would
best
suit
the
purpose
of
his
judges
in
these
answers
munnich
declared
himself
guilty
of
all
the
crimes
laid
to
his
charge
acknowledged
himself
to
be
a
traitor
and
deserving
death
when
they
had
finished
their
artistic
labor
they
handed
to
munnich
the
pen
for
his
signature
he
calmly
took
the
pen
and
while
affixing
his
signature
said
with
a
contemptuous
smile
was
i
not
right
in
this
way
it
is
rendered
much
easier
for
you
to
make
of
me
a
very
respectable
criminal
and
i
have
only
the
trouble
of
writing
my
name
i
thank
you
gentlemen
for
this
quick
and
decisive
as
were
the
hearings
now
followed
the
sentences
ostermann
was
condemned
to
be
broken
on
the
wheel
munnich
to
be
quartered
and
the
two
ministers
lowenwald
and
golopkin
to
the
axe
but
elizabeth
had
promised
her
people
that
no
one
should
be
punished
with
death
she
must
abide
by
that
promise
and
she
did
she
commuted
the
punishment
of
the
condemned
as
also
of
julia
von
mengden
into
banishment
to
siberia
for
life
what
a
grace
and
even
this
grace
was
first
communicated
to
ostermann
after
his
old
limbs
had
been
bound
to
the
wheel
and
his
executioners
were
on
the
point
of
crushing
him
but
even
in
this
extreme
moment
count
ostermann
s
calm
heroism
did
not
forsake
him
i
was
convinced
that
such
would
be
the
result
he
calmly
said
quietly
stretching
his
released
limbs
this
empress
elizabeth
has
not
the
courage
to
break
her
oath
by
chopping
off
a
few
heads
it
is
a
pity
on
the
wheel
it
might
have
become
a
little
warm
for
me
but
in
siberia
it
will
be
fearfully
from
the
windows
of
her
palace
elizabeth
had
witnessed
the
preparations
for
this
pretended
execution
and
as
she
knew
that
at
last
their
punishment
would
be
commuted
she
was
amused
to
see
the
solemn
earnestness
and
the
of
the
condemned
it
was
a
very
entertaining
hour
that
she
and
her
friends
passed
at
that
window
and
the
comical
face
of
old
ostermann
the
proud
gravity
of
count
munnich
the
folded
hands
and
glances
of
golopkin
and
lowenwald
had
often
made
her
laugh
until
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
that
was
a
magnificent
comedy
said
she
retreating
from
the
window
when
the
condemned
were
released
from
their
bands
and
raised
into
the
vehicles
that
were
immediately
to
start
with
them
for
siberia
yes
it
was
indeed
very
amusing
but
tell
me
lestocq
where
are
they
about
to
take
old
count
ostermann
to
the
most
northerly
part
of
siberia
calmly
replied
lestocq
poor
old
man
signed
elizabeth
it
must
be
very
sad
for
him
thus
to
pass
his
last
years
in
suffering
and
lestocq
seemed
not
to
have
heard
her
remark
and
laughingly
continued
to
munnich
i
have
thought
to
apply
a
jest
of
his
ah
a
jest
cried
elizabeth
suddenly
brightening
up
let
me
hear
it
you
know
i
love
a
jest
it
is
so
amusing
quick
therefore
let
us
hear
it
perhaps
your
majesty
may
remember
biron
duke
of
courland
said
lestocq
count
munnich
as
you
know
overthrew
him
and
placed
anna
leopoldowna
in
the
regency
biron
has
ever
since
lived
at
pelym
in
siberia
and
indeed
in
a
house
of
which
munnich
himself
drew
the
plan
the
rooms
of
which
are
so
low
that
poor
biron
who
is
as
tall
as
munnich
could
never
stand
erect
in
them
the
good
munnich
he
was
very
devoted
to
the
duke
and
hence
in
pure
friendship
invented
this
means
of
reminding
him
every
hour
in
the
day
of
the
architect
of
his
house
his
friend
munnich
ah
you
promised
us
a
jest
and
you
are
there
repeating
an
old
and
story
interposed
the
empress
yawning
now
comes
the
joke
continued
lestocq
we
have
transferred
biron
to
another
colony
and
herr
munnich
will
occupy
the
poetical
of
his
friend
biron
at
ah
that
is
delightful
in
fact
cried
elizabeth
clapping
her
little
hands
how
will
munnich
curse
himself
for
cruelty
which
now
comes
home
to
himself
that
is
very
witty
in
you
herr
lestocq
very
laughable
is
it
not
alexis
but
alexis
you
do
not
laugh
at
all
you
look
sad
what
is
the
matter
with
you
who
has
disobliged
who
has
wounded
you
alexis
sighed
you
yourself
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
exclaimed
the
astonished
empress
i
could
not
be
so
inhuman
no
only
to
wound
me
by
refusing
the
first
request
i
addressed
to
you
name
your
request
once
more
i
have
forgotten
it
said
elizabeth
with
vehemence
alexis
razumovsky
fell
upon
his
knees
before
her
and
imploringly
raising
his
hands
said
elizabeth
my
empress
have
compassion
for
my
care
and
anxiety
on
your
account
leave
me
not
to
tremble
for
your
safety
grant
me
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
unthreatened
and
free
from
danger
in
your
greatness
and
splendor
oh
elizabeth
listen
to
the
prayer
of
your
faithful
servant
let
not
this
anna
leopoldowna
pass
the
boundary
of
your
realm
let
not
your
most
deadly
enemy
escape
oh
grant
his
prayer
cried
lestocq
kneeling
beside
alexis
there
is
wisdom
in
his
words
listen
to
him
rather
than
to
the
too
great
generosity
of
your
own
heart
let
not
your
enemies
escape
but
seize
them
while
they
are
yet
in
your
power
elizabeth
greatest
and
fairest
woman
on
earth
implored
alexis
have
compassion
for
my
anxiety
i
shall
never
laugh
again
never
be
cheerful
if
you
allow
these
your
most
dangerous
enemies
to
withdraw
themselves
from
your
power
elizabeth
bent
down
to
him
with
a
smile
of
tenderness
and
laid
her
left
hand
upon
his
locks
while
with
her
right
she
gently
raised
his
head
to
herself
love
you
me
then
so
very
much
my
alexis
she
asked
that
you
suffer
with
anxiety
for
my
safety
ah
that
makes
me
happy
that
fills
my
whole
heart
with
joy
only
look
at
him
lestocq
see
how
beautiful
he
is
and
then
say
whether
one
can
refuse
the
prayer
of
those
heavenly
eyes
those
pleading
lips
you
will
then
grant
my
prayer
exultingly
asked
alexis
well
yes
tenderly
responded
she
since
there
is
no
other
means
of
rendering
you
again
cheerful
and
happy
i
must
indeed
consent
to
the
fulfilment
of
your
wishes
and
not
let
my
enemies
quit
the
country
if
it
be
yet
possible
to
retain
they
have
proceeded
by
slow
marches
and
can
hardly
now
have
arrived
in
riga
where
they
are
to
rest
several
days
said
lestocq
there
will
consequently
be
time
for
a
courier
yet
to
reach
them
with
your
and
he
must
be
dispatched
immediately
said
alexis
pressing
the
hand
of
the
empress
to
his
lips
in
this
hour
will
my
kind
and
gracious
empress
sign
the
command
for
the
arrest
of
anna
leopoldowna
her
husband
and
her
son
already
another
signature
sighed
elizabeth
how
you
annoy
me
with
this
eternal
signing
and
countersigning
will
it
then
never
have
an
end
i
already
begin
to
hate
my
name
because
of
being
compelled
so
often
to
write
it
under
your
musty
old
documents
why
did
the
emperor
my
dear
deceased
father
give
me
so
long
a
name
a
shorter
one
would
now
relieve
me
of
half
my
labor
but
in
spite
of
her
lamentings
elizabeth
nevertheless
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
subscribed
the
order
to
arrest
the
regent
her
husband
and
son
and
shut
them
up
preliminarily
in
the
citadel
of
riga
so
now
i
hope
you
will
again
be
happy
and
cheerful
said
she
throwing
away
the
pen
and
with
a
tender
glance
at
razumovsky
come
look
at
me
i
have
done
all
you
wished
let
us
now
be
gay
and
take
our
and
while
elizabeth
was
jesting
and
laughing
with
alexis
lestocq
taking
the
order
hurried
away
to
dispatch
his
courier
at
length
they
had
reached
the
borders
of
this
feared
pernicious
russian
empire
they
now
needed
no
longer
to
tremble
no
longer
to
fear
at
the
slightest
sound
only
a
short
quarter
of
an
hour
and
the
boundary
will
be
passed
and
liberty
secured
they
had
made
a
halt
at
a
small
public
house
near
the
boundary
the
horses
were
to
be
changed
there
and
there
the
soldiers
of
the
escort
were
to
get
their
last
taste
of
russian
brandy
before
crossing
the
border
anna
and
her
husband
have
remained
in
the
sledge
she
holds
her
son
in
her
arms
she
presses
him
to
her
bosom
full
of
exulting
maternal
joy
for
he
is
now
saved
this
poor
little
emperor
anna
has
now
no
longer
to
fear
that
her
son
will
be
torn
from
her
he
is
saved
he
belongs
to
her
she
can
rejoice
in
his
childish
beauty
in
the
happy
consciousness
of
safety
she
has
thrown
back
the
curtains
of
the
sledge
she
felt
no
cold
with
eyes
she
looked
forward
to
that
blessed
land
beyond
the
boundary
there
where
upon
its
tall
staff
the
russian
flag
floated
high
in
the
air
there
freedom
and
happiness
were
to
begin
for
her
there
will
she
find
again
her
youth
and
her
maiden
dreams
her
cheerfulness
and
her
pleasure
there
is
freedom
golden
heavenly
freedom
she
is
so
happy
at
this
moment
that
she
loves
all
and
every
one
for
the
first
time
she
feels
a
sort
of
tenderness
for
her
husband
who
patiently
bearing
all
in
silence
had
complained
and
wept
only
for
her
gently
she
reclined
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
with
a
cry
of
ecstasy
the
prince
encircled
her
neck
with
his
arms
oh
my
husband
she
whispered
with
overflowing
eyes
look
there
over
there
there
is
our
future
there
will
we
seek
for
happiness
perhaps
we
may
unitedly
find
it
in
the
same
path
for
we
have
here
a
sweet
bond
to
hold
our
hands
together
look
at
him
your
son
ulrich
you
are
the
father
of
my
child
grant
my
heart
only
a
little
repose
and
perhaps
we
may
yet
be
happy
with
each
prince
ulrich
s
eyes
were
suffused
with
tears
he
experienced
a
moment
of
the
purest
happiness
he
impressed
a
kiss
upon
the
brow
of
his
wife
and
in
a
low
tone
called
her
by
the
tenderest
names
the
child
awoke
and
smilingly
looked
up
from
anna
s
bosom
to
both
of
his
parents
anna
lifted
up
the
little
ivan
look
there
my
son
said
she
there
you
will
no
longer
be
an
emperor
but
you
will
have
the
right
to
be
a
free
and
happy
man
no
crown
awaits
you
there
but
freedom
worth
more
than
all
the
crowns
in
the
little
ivan
exultingly
stretched
forth
his
tiny
arms
as
if
he
would
draw
down
to
his
childish
heart
this
future
and
this
freedom
so
highly
lauded
by
his
mother
and
like
the
child
the
parents
looked
smilingly
out
upon
the
broad
expanse

these

the

already
bears
detached
sounds
to
anna

she
trembles
it
is
as
if
her
boding
soul
scented
the
approaching
evil
pressing
her
child
closer
to

she
gives
her

the

all
is
ready
for

to
go
on
over

draw
the

a
wild
cry
of

prince
ulrich
in
mortal
anguish
halt
in
the
name
of
the
empress
cried
an
officer
who
came
rushing
past
upon
a
foaming
steed
and
he
handed
to
the
commander
of
the
escort
an
open
writing
furnished
with
the
imperial
seal
the
commander
turned
to
the
postilions
to
the
right
about
toward
riga
ordered
he
and
then
turning
to
the
trembling
princely
pair
he
said
in
the
name
of
the
empress
you
are
my
prisoners
i
am
directed
to
conduct
you
to
the
citadel
of
riga
with
a
loud
groan
anna
sinks
into
the
arms
of
her
husband
he
consoles
her
with
the
most
soothing
and
affectionate
words
he
has
thought
sorrow
only
for
her
he
feels
not
for
himself
but
only
for
her
for
a
moment
anna
was
overpowered
by
this
unexpected
horror
then
she
calmly
rose
erect
and
pressed
her
son
more
closely
to
her
bosom
we
are
all
lost
whispered
she
prisoners
forever
poor
child
poor
unhappy

prince
ulrich
all
may

turn
out
well
who
knows
how
soon
aid
may
reach
us
anna
lightly
shook
her
head
and
thinking
of
the
last
words
of
her
friend
she
murmured
low
punishment
passes
but
love
remains
the
palace
of
the
empress
the
new
empress
elizabeth
had
rewarded
and
punished
and
with
that
thought
she
had
finished
her
imperial
labors
and
forever
dismissed
all
her
difficulties
i
have
shaken
off
my
imperial
burdens
said
she
to
her
friends
let
us
now
begin
to
enjoy
the
imperial
pleasures
ah
we
shall
lead
a
pleasant
life
in
this
splendid
palace
my
first
law
is
this
no
one
shall
speak
to
me
of
government
business
or
state
affairs
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
things
do
you
hear
for
what
purpose
do
i
have
my
ministers
and
my
council
go
you
with
such
wearisome
questions
to
my
grand
chancellor
tscherkaskoy
and
my
minister
bestuscheff
they
shall
govern
for
me
i
can
demand
that
of
them
as
i
pay
them
for
it
if
you
seek
an
office
if
you
have
invented
any
thing
for
promoting
the
welfare
of
the
country
if
you
have
found
any
official
abuse
or
discovered
any
conspiracy
then
go
to
bestuscheff
or
to
woronzow
or
also
to
lestocq
spare
me
but
when
you
have
a
grace
to
demand
when
you
need
money
when
you
desire
a
title
or
orders
then
come
to
me
and
i
will
satisfy
your
wishes
we
have
much
money
many
ribbons
for
orders
and
as
for
titles
they
are
the
cheapest
and
most
convenient
of
all
as
they
cost
absolutely
nothing
ah
a
jest
just
now
occurs
to
me
we
will
amuse
ourselves
a
little
we
will
have
a
call
our
courtiers
attendants
and
servants
we
shall
have
a
gay
time
of
it
we
will
have
a
game
at
dice
bring
the
dice
i
will
at
each
throw
announce
the
prize
and
the
dice
shall
then
decide
who
is
the
winner
they
all
gathered
around
her
the
noble
gentlemen
of
her
consisting
of
the
grenadiers
who
had
been
raised
to
nobility
and
created
officers
at
the
commencement
of
her
reign
they
came
noisily
with
singing
and
laughing
and
saluting
their
empress
elizabeth
with
a
thundering
first
of
all
let
us
drink
your
health
sir
captain
said
she
ordering
wine
to
be
brought
as
well
as
brandy
of
the
costly
sort
she
had
lately
received
as
a
present
from
the
greatest
distiller
of
her
capital
to
which
she
herself
was
very
partial
loudly
clinked
their
glasses
loudly
was
shouted
a
to
the
empress
which
elizabeth
laughingly
accepted
by
offering
them
her
hands
to
kiss
and
was
delighted
when
they
fell
into
ecstasies
over
the
beauty
and
freshness
of
those
hands
now
silence
gentlemen
of
the
she
cried
i
your
captain
command
attention
and
when
silence
was
established
she
continued
we
will
have
a
game
at
dice
and
titles
and
orders
gold
and
brandy
shall
be
the
prizes
for
which
you
shall
contend
ah
that
is
magnificent
that
is
a
glorious
game
exclaimed
they
all
the
first
prize
said
elizabeth
is
the
position
of
privy
councillor
now
take
the
dice
gentlemen
they
began
to
throw
the
dice
with
laughter
and
shouting
when
they
had
thrown
a
high
number
with
lamentations
and
stamping
of
the
feet
when
it
was
a
low
one
in
the
meanwhile
elizabeth
listlessly
stretched
herself
upon
a
divan
and
laughingly
said
to
alexis
who
sat
by
her
side
oh
it
is
very
pleasant
to
be
an
empress
only
see
how
happy
they
all
are
and
it
is
i
alone
who
make
them
so
for
out
of
these
common
soldiers
i
have
created
respectable
officers
and
have
converted
serfs
into
barons
and
gentlemen
i
thank
you
alexis
for
impelling
me
to
become
an
empress
it
is
a
noble
pleasure
and
i
should
now
be
unwilling
to
return
to
that
still
and
uneventful
life
that
formerly
pleased
me
so
well
i
will
so
manage
that
the
empress
elizabeth
shall
be
as
little
troubled
with
labor
and
business
as
the
princess
and
the
empress
can
doubtlessly
procure
for
herself
more
pleasures
than
could
the
princess
yes
certainly
i
will
now
remain
what
i
am
am
empress
by
the
grace
of
god
a
thundering
shout
and
loud
laughter
here
interrupted
elizabeth
the
dice
had
decided
the
cook
of
the
empress
had
won
and
become
a
councillor
of
state
elizabeth
laughed
these
dice
are
very
witty
said
she
for
certainly
the
cook
must
be
a
privy
councillor
i
establish
you
in
your
dignity
feodor
your
title
is
recognized
now
for
a
new
trial
two
thousand
rubles
is
the
prize
which
i
think
of
more
value
than
a
title
there
was
a
zealous
pressing
and
shoving
a
pushing
and
puffing
every
one
desired
to
be
the
first
to
get
hold
of
the
dice
and
struggle
for
the
rich
prize
there
were
many
ungentle
encounters
many
a
thrust
in
the
ribs
many
invectives
many
a
gross
unseemly
word
the
empress
saw
all
heard
all
laughed
at
all
and
said
to
alexis
these
gentlemen
are
very
practical
two
thousand
rubles
are
estimated
by
them
at
a
higher
rate
than
the
proudest
title
i
comprehend
that
a
title
is
a
nonsensical
thing
of
which
no
real
use
can
be
made
but
what
beautiful
dresses
can
be
bought
with
two
thousand
rubles
and
that
reminds
me
that
you
have
not
yet
told
me
how
you
like
this
dress
of
mine
you
take
so
little
notice
of
my
toilet
dearest
and
yet
it
is
only
for
you
that
i
change
my
dress
seven
or
eight
times
a
day
i
would
every
hour
please
you
better
and
oh
no
dressing
is
necessary
for
that
tenderly
responded
alexis
and
stooping
he
whispered
some
words
in
her
ear
which
pleased
her
well
and
made
her
laugh
heartily
meanwhile
the
dicing
continued
blind
luck
scattered
her
gifts
in
the
strangest
manner
of
the
palace
attained
to
high
titles
and
high
officers
with
laughing
faces
won
pipes
of
brandy
barons
of
the
made
of
men
who
but
a
few
days
before
had
been
serfs
were
seen
approaching
the
mirrors
with
vain
coxcombry
to
see
the
effect
of
orders
just
won
by
a
cast
of
the
dice
or
with
greedy
avidity
pocketing
the
rubles
which
fortune
had
thrown
to
them
it
was
a
jovial
and
brilliant
evening
and
in
dismissing
her
friends
elizabeth
promised
them
many
repetitions
of
it
and
she
kept
her
word
frenzied
pleasures
and
festivals
of
the
roughest
sorts
were
now
the
principal
occupation
of
the
new
empress
the
amusement
of
her
court
the
providing
it
with
new
festivals
and
pleasures
she
considered
as
the
first
and
most
important
of
her
imperial
duties
and
these
alone
she
endeavored
to
fulfil
but
who
composed
her
court
and
of
what
elements
did
it
consist
elizabeth
found
the
presence
of
her
serious
official
councillors
very
tiresome
as
they
knew
not
how
to
make
themselves
agreeable
she
found
the
surrounding
of
herself
with
the
respectable
ladies
of
her
court
to
be
very
incommodious
as
there
might
some
day
be
found
among
them
one
with
a
handsomer
or
more
tasteful
toilet
than
herself
or
indeed
one
who
might
dare
to
be
of
a
finer
type
of
beauty
than
she
she
therefore
gladly
avoided
inviting
the
distinguished
men
of
her
court
with
their
wives
or
the
higher
class
of
state
officials
it
was
far
more
convenient
far
more
agreeable
to
surround
herself
with
frivolous
and
handsome
young
men
they
knew
how
to
laugh
and
be
cheerful
and
she
was
thus
sure
that
no
other
lady
would
be
there
to
dispute
with
her
the
palm
of
beauty
elizabeth
was
not
proud
she
cared
not
whether
noble
blood
flowed
in
the
veins
of
those
who
were
invited
to
her
festivals
the
youth
beauty
and
agreeable
qualities
which
the
empress
found
in
any
person
alone
decided
the
question
of
their
admittance
to
the
court
peasants
grooms
soldiers
servants
abandoned
reprobates
who
by
their
beauty
had
won
the
favor
of
the
empress
were
seen
to
attain
to
the
highest
stations
on
them
were
lavished
the
treasures
of
the
state
they
were
adorned
with
orders
and
titles
and
the
magnates
bowed
to
the
ground
before
these
potent
favorites
of
the
empress
and
the
people
shouted
with
transport
when
their
beloved
czarina
with
her
magnificent
train
of
noblemen
made
her
appearance
in
the
streets
and
with
gracious
smiles
returned
the
humble
salutations
of
her
kneeling
slaves
that
was
the
ruler
in
perfect
accordance
with
russian
ideas
they
sympathized
with
her
inclinations
and
pleasures
she
was
blood
of
their
blood
and
flesh
of
their
flesh
the
strangers
were
at
length
banished
and
a
real
russian
sat
upon
the
throne
of
the
czars
and
yet
elizabeth
trembled
upon
her
imperial
throne
surrounded
by
the
band
of
magnates
and
nobles
of
whom
she
could
truly
say
i
am
their
creator
they
are
my
work
she
trembled
before
those
secret
daggers
those
lingering
poisons
which
always
surround
the
imperial
russian
throne
as
its
truest
satellites
and
lay
low
many
a
head
she
trembled
before
anna
leopoldowna
who
was
sighing
away
her
days
in
the
closed
citadel
of
riga
and
before
anna
s
son
the
infant
ivan
whom
the
empress
anna
in
her
testament
had
named
as
emperor
of
all
the
russias
she
indeed
would
not
work
and
trouble
herself
for
her
country
and
her
people
this
good
empress
by
the
grace
of
god
but
yet
she
would
be
empress
that
she
might
be
enabled
to
enjoy
life
and
no
cloud
must
obscure
the
heaven
of
her
earthly
glory
she
therefore
tore
herself
for
some
short
hours
from
the
pleasures
in
which
she
was
usually
immersed
from
the
arms
of
her
lover
the
object
of
her
deepest
interest
her
own
safety
and
her
own
peace
were
concerned
that
was
well
worth
the
effort
to
take
the
pen
once
more
in
hand
and
affix
the
troublesomely
long
name
of
elizabeth
to
some
few
official
documents
she
consequently
signed
the
command
to
bring
back
anna
leopoldowna
and
her
husband
from
the
citadel
of
riga
to
the
interior
of
russia
and
place
them
in
strict
confinement
in
raninburg
she
also
signed
another
order
and
that
was
to
rend
the
young
ivan
from
the
arms
of
his
mother
to
take
him
to
the
castle
of
schlusselburg
and
there
to
hold
him
in
strict
imprisonment
to
grow
up
without
teachers
or
any
kind
of
instruction
and
without
the
least
occupation
or
amusement
i
well
know
said
she
with
a
sigh
as
she
signed
the
document
i
well
know
that
it
would
be
better
for
this
ivan
to
be
executed
for
than
to
remain
in
this
condition
but
i
lack
the
courage
for
it
it
is
so
horrible
to
kill
a
poor
innocent
child
and
in
this
way
we
attain
our
end
more
safely
said
lestocq
with
a
smile
your
majesty
has
sworn
to
take
the
life
of
no
one
very
well
you
keep
your
word
as
to
physical
life
we
do
not
destroy
the
body
but
the
spirit
of
this
boy
ivan
we
raise
him
as
an
idiot
which
is
the
surest
means
of
rendering
him
innoxious
elizabeth
had
signed
the
order
and
her
command
was
executed
they
took
from
anna
leopoldowna
her
last
joy
her
only
consolation
they
took
away
her
son
whose
smiling
face
had
lighted
her
prison
as
with
sunbeams
whose
childishly
stammered
words
had
sounded
to
her
as
the
voice
of
an
angel
from
heaven
they
took
the
poor
weeping
child
to
schlusselburg
and
his
crushed
and
parents
first
to
raninburg
and
finally
to
the
fortress
kolmogory
situated
upon
an
island
in
the
dwina
near
to
that
gulf
which
on
account
of
its
ice
has
obtained
the
name
of
the
no
one
could
rescue
poor
anna
leopoldowna
from
that
fortress
no
one
could
release
her
son
the
poor
little
emperor
ivan
from
schlusselburg
they
were
rendered
perfectly
inoffensive
elizabeth
had
not
killed
them
she
had
only
buried
them
alive
this
good
russian
empress
and
nevertheless
she
still
trembled
upon
her
throne
she
still
felt
unsafe
in
her
imperial
magnificence
she
yet
trembled
on
account
of
another
pretender
the
duke
karl
peter
ulrich
of
holstein
who
as
the
son
of
an
elder
daughter
of
peter
the
great
had
a
more
direct
claim
to
the
throne
than
elizabeth
herself
that
no
party
might
declare
for
him
and
invite
him
to
russia
her
ministers
advised
the
empress
herself
to
send
for
him
and
declare
him
her
successor
elizabeth
followed
this
advice
and
the
young
duke
peter
ulrich
of
holstein
accepted
her
call
declining
the
crown
of
sweden
he
professed
the
greek
religion
in
petersburg
was
clothed
with
the
title
of
grand
prince
by
elizabeth
and
declared
her
successor
to
the
throne
of
the
czars
elizabeth
could
now
undisturbedly
enjoy
her
imperial
splendor
the
successor
to
the
throne
was
assured
anna
leopoldowna
languished
in
the
fortress
of
kolmogory
and
in
schlusselburg
the
little
emperor
ivan
was
passing
his
childish
who
was
there
now
to
contest
her
rights
who
would
dare
an
attempt
to
shake
a
throne
which
rested
upon
such
safe
pillars
of
public
favor
and
which
so
many
counts
and
barons
protected
with
their
broad
shoulders
and
nervous
arms
elizabeth
had
no
more
need
to
govern
no
more
occasion
to
tremble
she
let
sink
the
hand
which
with
a
single
stroke
of
the
pen
could
give
laws
to
millions
of
men
which
could
give
them
interminable
sorrow
and
endless
torments
she
again
took
the
heavy
imperial
crown
from
her
head
replacing
it
with
wreaths
of
myrtles
and
roses
she
permitted
tscherkaskoy
to
govern
and
bestuscheff
to
sell
to
england
the
dearest
interests
of
russia
she
permitted
her
ministers
to
govern
with
unrestricted
power
and
was
rejoiced
when
no
one
came
to
trouble
her
about
affairs
of
state
or
the
interests
of
her
people
eleonore
lapuschkin
two
years
had

elizabeth

accession

two
years
of
pleasure
and
enjoyment
only
troubled
here
and
there
with
occasional
small
clouds
of
but
those
clouds
overshadowed
only
her
domestic
peace
it
was
not
the
affairs
of
state
not
the
interests
of
her
people
that
troubled
and
saddened
elizabeth
she
asked
not
how
many
of
her
subjects
the
war
with
sweden
had
swept
away
how
many
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
hunger
in
the
southern
provinces
of
her
realm
she
had
quite
other
cares
and
anxieties
than
those
which
concerned
only
her
ministers
not
herself
what
have
princes
to
do
with
the
happiness
of
their
people
elizabeth
was
a
consummate
princess
she
thought
only
of
her
own
happiness
only
of
herself
and
her
own
sorrows
and
it
was
a
very
severe
very
incurable
sorrow
that
visited
her
a
sorrow
that
often
brought
tears
of
anger
into
her
eyes
and
curses
upon
her
lips
elizabeth
was
jealous
jealous
not
of
this
or
that
woman
but
of
the
whole
sex
she
glowingly
desired
to
be
the
fairest
of
all
women
and
constantly
trembled
lest
some
one
should
come
to
rob
her
of
the
prize
of
beauty
and
were
there
not
in
her
own
court
women
who
might
venture
to
enter
the
lists
with
her
was
there
not
before
all
one
woman
whose
aspect
filled
the
heart
of
the
empress
with
a
thirst
for
vengeance
of
whom
she
was
compelled
to
say
that
she
was
younger
handsomer
and
more
attractive
than
herself
and
this
one
was
it
not
eleonore
lapuschkin
for
two
long
years
had
elizabeth
borne
about
with
her
this
hatred
and
jealousy
for
two
long
years
had
she
in
vain
sought
to
discover
some
punishable
fault
in
her
rival
for
two
long
years
had
she
in
vain
reminded
lestocq
of
his
promise
to
find
eleonore
lapuschkin
guilty
of
some
crime
she
had
come
out
pure
from
all
these
persecuting
pursuits
and
even
the
eyes
of
the
most
zealous
spy
could
find
no
blot
upon
her
escutcheon
like
a
royal
lily
she
proudly
bloomed
with
undisputed
splendor
in
the
midst
of
this
court
whose
petty
cabals
and
intrigues
could
not
soil
her
fair
fame
her
presence
spread
around
her
a
sort
of
magic
the
most
audacious
courtier
the
most
presumptuous
cavalier
approached
her
with
only
reverence
they
ventured
not
in
her
presence
to
use
such
words
and
jests
as
but
too
well
pleased
the
empress
there
was
something
in
eleonore
s
glance
that
commanded
involuntary
respect
and
awe
an
elevation
a
mildness
a
soft
feminine
majesty
was
shed
over
her
whole
being
that
enchanted
even
those
who
were
inimical
to
her
elizabeth
had
perceived
that
with
her
eyes
sharpened
by
jealousy
her
envy
was
yet
more
mighty
than
her
vanity
and
her
envy
told
her
eleonore
lapuschkin
is
handsomer
than
the
empress
elizabeth
wherever
eleonore
appears
there
all
hearts
fly
to
meet
her
all
glances
incline
to
her
every
one
feels
a
sort
of
ecstasy
of
adoration
whom
she
greets
with
a
word
or
a
smile
for
that
word
or
that
smile
sanctifies
him
as
it
were
and
enrolls
him
among
the
noblest
and
best
and
even
alexis
had
been
unable
to
withstand
this
magic
oh
elizabeth
narrowly
watched
him
she
had
analyzed
his
every
word
and
every
glance
she
had
seen
how
he
always
pressed
near
her
how
he
blushed
with
joy
when
she
remarked
his
presence
and
returned
his
salutation
yea
she
and
perhaps
only
she
had
seen
alexis
covertly
possess
himself
of
the
glove
which
eleonore
had
lost
the
previous
evening
at
the
grand
court
ball
had
seen
him
press
that
glove
to
his
lips
and
afterward
conceal
it
in
his
bosom
as
elizabeth
thought
of
these
things
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
her
whole
form
shook
with
rage
she
felt
unable
to
be
angry
with
or
to
punish
him
but
she
was
resolved
that
eleonore
lapuschkin
should
feel
the
whole
weight
of
her
vengeance
oh
said
she
while
pacing
her
boudoir
in
a
state
of
violent
excitement
i
shall
know
how
to
punish
this
presumptuous
woman
ha
does
she
not
give
herself
the
appearance
of
not
remarking
that
i
constantly
have
for
her
a
clouded
brow
and
an
unfriendly
greeting
how
will
she
not
take
the
pains
to
see
that
her
empress
looks
upon
her
with
disfavor
but
she
shall
see
and
feel
that
i
hate
that
i
abhor
her
oh
what
a
powerless
creature
is
yet
an
empress
i
hate
this
woman
and
she
has
the
impudence
to
think
i
can
not
punish
her
unless
she
is
and
weeping
aloud
elizabeth
threw
herself
upon
the
divan
a
low
knock
at
the
door
recalled
her
attention
from
her
angry
grief
rising
she
bade
the
person
at
the
door
to
enter
it
was
lestocq
the
privy
councillor
and
president
lestocq
the
confidant
of
the
empress
who
came
with
a
joyful
face
and
cheerful
smile
elizabeth
felt
annoyed
by
this
cheerfulness
of
her
physician
with
an
angry
frown
she
turned
her
back
upon
him
why
were
you
not
at
the
court
ball
last
evening
she
then
roughly
said
i
was
there
answered
lestocq
ah
that
is
not
true
cried
the
empress
with
vehemence
glad
at
least
to
have
some
one
on
whom
she
could
discharge
her
anger
it
is
false
i
say
no
one
saw
you
there
ah
you
dare
then
to
impose
a
falsehood
upon
your
empress
you
would
i
was
at
the
court
ball
interposed
lestocq
i
saw
and
noted
all
that
occurred
there
i
saw
that
my
empress
beamed
in
all
the
splendor
of
beauty
and
yet
with
her
amiable
modesty
she
thought
eleonore
lapuschkin
handsomer
than
herself
i
read
in
elizabeth
s
noble
brow
that
she
was
pained
by
this
and
that
she
promised
to
punish
the
presumption
of
the
insolent
and
to
what
end
have
you
read
all
that
responded
elizabeth
with
vehemence
to
what
end
since
you
are
so
sluggish
a
servant
that
you
make
no
effort
to
fulfil
any
wish
of
your
mistress
to
what
end
since
you
are
so
disregardful
of
your
word
as
not
to
hold
even
your
oath
sacred
i
was
at
the
ball
precisely
because
i
remembered
my
oath
said
lestocq
because
i
was
intent
upon
redeeming
my
word
and
delivering
over
to
you
this
countess
lapuschkin
as
a
criminal
but
you
could
not
recognize
me
as
i
was
in
the
disguise
of
a
lackey
of
the
countess
eleonore
elizabeth
springing
up
from
her
seat
stared
with
breathless
curiosity
into
lestocq
s
face
well
she
anxiously
asked
as
lestocq
remained
silent
speak
on
then
what
further
illustrious
empress
said
lestocq
i
am
now
here
to
redeem
my
word
this
countess
eleonore
lapuschkin
is
a
criminal
ah
thank
god
cried
elizabeth
breathing
more
freely
by
various
intrigues
and
stratagems
by
bribery
of
her
servants
i
have
finally
succeeded
in
spying
out
her
secrets
and
last
evening
when
as
her
lackey
i
conducted
her
from
the
ball
and
afterward
waited
at
table
at
an
entertainment
given
by
her
husband
to
some
confidential
friends
last
evening
her
whole
plan
was
made
clear
to
me
it
is
a
great
and
very
important
conspiracy
that
i
have
detected
this
countess
eleonore
lapuschkin
is
guilty
of
she
conspires
against
her
legitimate
empress
ah
she
conspires
exclaimed
elizabeth
with
a
fierce
laugh
for
whom
then
does
she
conspire
for
one
whose
name
i
dare
not
utter
without
the
express
permission
of
my
empress
speak
speak
quickly
lestocq
bent
down
close
to
the
ear
of
the
empress
she
conspires
for
the
schlusselburg
prisoner
ivan
said
he
i
shall
therefore
be
able
to
punish
her
said
elizabeth
smilingly
i
shall
no
longer
be
obliged
to
suffer
this
hated
woman
within
the
walls
of
my
capital
siberia
has
room
for
her
and
her
replied
lestocq
for
this
fair
countess
is
not
alone
guilty
although
she
is
the
soul
of
the
conjuration
as
it
is
love
that
animates
her
eleonore
lapuschkin
conspires
for
her
lover
oh
this
adored
saint
has
then
a
lover
exclaimed
the
empress
and
i
believed
her
spotless
as
a
lily
so
pure
that
i
felt
abashed
in
her
presence
you
have
banished
her
lover
to
siberia
the
lover
of
eleonore
count
lowenwald
you
may
believe
that
that
has
caused
her
a
mortal
ah
joyfully
exclaimed
elizabeth
i
have
therefore
unknowingly
caused
her
tears
to
flow
but
i
will
yet
do
it
with
a
perfect
consciousness
relate
to
me
in
detail
exactly
what
you
know
of
this
conspiracy
and
lestocq
related
that
eleonore
lapuschkin
in
connection
with
her
husband
the
chamberlain
lilienfeld
and
madame
bestuscheff
who
was
the
sister
of
the
condemned
golopkin
had
entered
into
a
conspiracy
for
the
overthrow
of
elizabeth
and
the
placing
of
ivan
upon
the
throne
and
thus
releasing
the
prisoners
banished
to
siberia
oh
they
were
very
gay
at
the
yesterday
s
dinner
of
the
conspirators
said
lestocq
the
husband
of
countess
lapuschkin
even
ventured
to
drink
the
health
of
the
emperor
ivan
and
to
his
speedy
liberation
but
that
is
exclaimed
elizabeth
ah
i
had
cause
to
tremble
and
eternally
to
stand
in
fear
of
my
murderers
i
already
see
them
lurking
around
me
encircling
me
on
all
sides
to
destroy
me
lestocq
save
me
from
my
murderers
and
with
a
cry
of
anguish
the
empress
clung
convulsively
to
the
arm
of
her
physician
the
incautiousness
of
these
conspirators
has
already
saved
you
empress
said
lestocq
they
have
delivered
themselves
into
our
hand
they
have
made
us
masters
of
the
situation
what
would
you
more
you
will
punish
the
traitors
that
is
all
and
i
can
not
kill
them
shrieked
elizabeth
with
closed
fists
i
have
tied
my
own
hands
in
my
unwise
generosity
ah
they
call
me
an
empress
and
yet
i
can
not
destroy
those
i
hate
and
who
denies
you
that
right
asked
lestocq
destroy
their
bodies
but
kill
them
not
wherefore
have
we
the
knout
if
it
can
not
flay
the
back
of
a
beauty
yes
wherefore
have
we
the
knout
exclaimed
elizabeth
with
a
joyous
laugh
ah
lestocq
you
are
an
exquisite
man
you
always
give
good
advice
ah
this
beautiful
countess
eleonore
shall
be
made
acquainted
with
the
knout
you
have
a
double
right
for
it
said
lestocq
for
she
has
dared
to
speak
of
your
majesty
in
unseemly
language
has
she
done
that
cried
elizabeth
ah
i
almost
love
her
for
it
as
that
gives
me
the
right
to
chastise
her
lestocq
what
punishment
is
prescribed
for
a
subject
who
dares
revile
his
empress
you
must
know
it
you
are
familiar
with
the
laws
therefore
tell
me
quickly
what
punishment
it
is
written
said
lestocq
after
a
moment
s
reflection
that
any
one
who
dares
so
misuse
his
tongue
as
to
revile
the
sublime
majesty
of
his
emperor
or
empress
with
irreverent
language
such
criminal
shall
have
the
instrument
of
his
crime
his
tongue
torn
out
by
the
roots
and
this
time
i
will
exercise
no
mercy
triumphantly
exclaimed
elizabeth
she
kept
her
word
she
exercised
no
mercy
count
lapuschkin
with
his
fair
wife
the
wife
of
bestuscheff
the
chamberlain
lilienfeld
and
some
others
were
accused
of
and
brought
before
the
tribunal
it
was
not
difficult
to
convict
the
countess
of
the
crime
charged
incautiously
enough
had
she
often
expressed
her
attachment
to
the
cause
of
the
imprisoned
emperor
ivan
and
her
contempt
for
the
empress
elizabeth
and
in
what
country
is
it
not
a
crime
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
the
prince
though
he
be
a
criminal
and
one
of
the
lowest
of
men
she
was
therefore
declared
guilty
she
was
sentenced
to
be
scourged
with
the
knout
to
have
her
tongue
torn
out
and
to
be
transported
to
siberia
elizabeth
did
not
pardon
her
she
was
a
princess
how
then
could
she
pardon
one
who
had
dared
to
revile
her
every
crime
is
easier
to
pardon
than
that
of
for
every
other
there
may
be
extenuating
circumstances
for
that
never
it
is
a
capital
crime
which
a
prince
never
pardons
how
then
could
elizabeth
have
done
so
elizabeth
empress
by
the
grace
of
god
as
all
are
princes
and
kings
by
the
grace
of
god
the
people
were
running
to
and
fro
in
the
wildest
confusion
in
the
streets
of
petersburg
they
cried
and
shouted
to
their
empress
who
accorded
to
them
the
splendid
spectacle
of
the
knouting
of
some
respectable
ladies
and
gentlemen
ah
that
was
a
very
gracious
and
condescending
empress
to
provide
once
more
a
delightful
spectacle
for
her
serfs
at
the
expense
of
the
nobility
that
was
an
empress
after
their
own
hearts
real
russian
blood
shrieking
and
shouting
they
rushed
to
the
place
of
execution
pressing
against
the
barriers
that
separated
the
central
point
from
the
spectators
there
stood
the
bearded
assistants
of
the
executioner
there
lay
the
knouts
and
other
instruments
and
with
eager
glances
the
people
devoured
all
they
found
all
these
preparations
admirable
they
rejoiced
with
unrestrained
delight
in
the
prospect
of
seeing
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
realm
flayed
with
the
knout
and
not
the
common
people
alone
the
must
also
be
present
the
great
magnates
of
the
court
must
also
come
if
they
would
avoid
exciting
a
suspicion
that
they
commiserated
the
condemned
and
revolted
at
their
punishment
they
all
came
these
slavish
magnates
perhaps
with
tears
in
their
hearts
but
with
smiles
upon
their
lips
perhaps
murmuring
secret
curses
but
aloud
applauding
the
just
sentence
of
the
empress
now
the
closed
carriages
of
the
condemned
were
seen
approaching
in
a
long
lingering
train
the
train
halted
the
doors
were
opened
and
in
the
centre
of
the
place
of
execution
appeared
eleonore
lapuschkin
radiant
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
purest
beauty
her
noble
form
enveloped
in
a
full
draping
robe
which
lent
to
her
loveliness
an
additional
charm
she
looked
around
with
an
astonished
and
interrogating
glance
as
if
awaking
from
a
confused
dream
young
amiable
the
first
and
most
celebrated
lady
of
the
court
of
which
she
was
the
most
brilliant
ornament
she
now
sees
herself
instead
of
the
admirers
who
humbly
paid
their
court
to
her
surrounded
by
these
rough
executioners
who
regard
her
with
bold
and
insolent
glances
eagerly
stretching
forth
their
hands
for
their
prey
one
of
them
approaching
her
ventures
to
rend
from
her
bosom
the
kerchief
that
covers
it
eleonore
shuddering
shrinks
back
her
cheeks
are
pale
as
marble
a
stream
of
tears
gushes
from
her
eyes
in
vain
she
implores
in
vain
her
lamentations
in
vain
her
trembling
innocence
in
vain
her
efforts
to
cover
herself
anew
her
clothes
are
torn
off
and
in
a
few
moments
she
stands
there
naked
to
the
girdle
with
all
the
upper
portion
of
her
person
exposed
to
the
eager
glances
of
the
masses
who
in
silence
stare
at
this
specimen
of
the
purest
feminine
beauty
the
proud
lily
is
broken
shattered
she
bows
her
head
the
storm
has
crushed
her
incapable
of
resistance
she
is
seized
by
one
of
the
executioners
who
by
a
sudden
movement
throws
her
upon
her
back
another
then
approaches
and
places
her
in
the
most
convenient
position
for
receiving
the
punishment
soon
with
rough
brutality
he
lays
his
broad
hand
upon
her
head
and
places
it
so
that
it
may
not
be
hit
by
the
knout
and
then
like
a
butcher
who
is
about
to
throttle
a
lamb
he
caresses
that
back
as
if
taking
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
the
wonderful
fairness
of
his
victim
now
is
she
in
the
right
position
he
steps
back
and
raising
the
knout
brings
it
down
upon
eleonore
s
back
with
such
accuracy
that
it
takes
off
a
strip
of
skin
from
her
neck
to
her
girdle
then
he
swings
the
knout
anew
with
the
same
accuracy
and
the
same
result
in
a
few
moments
her
skin
hangs
in
shreds
over
her
girdle
her
whole
form
is
dripping
with
blood
and
the
shuddering
spectators
venture
not
a
single
bravo
for
this
dexterous
executioner
the
work
is
finished
with
a
flayed
back
eleonore
is
raised
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
executioner
she
has
not
screamed
she
has
not
moaned
she
has
remained
dumb
and
without
complaint
but
she
has
prayed
to
god
for
vengeance
and
expiation
for
the
shame
inflicted
upon
her
and
again
advances
the
executioner
with
a
pair
of
pincers
in
his
hand
eleonore
looks
at
him
through
eyes
flaming
with
anger
what
would
you
she
coldly
asks
tear
out
your
tongue
answers
he
with
a
rude
laugh
two
of
the
executioner
s
assistants
then
seizing
her
grasp
her
head
this
time
eleonore
defends
herself
despair
lends
her
strength
freeing
herself
from
the
grasp
of
these
barbarous
executioners
she
falls
upon
her
knees
and
raising
her
bloody
arms
toward
heaven
implores
the
mercy
of
god
glancing
at
the
spectators
she
implores
their
pity
and
their
aid
turning
her
eyes
toward
the
proud
imperial
palace
where
elizabeth
sits
enthroned
she
begs
there
for
grace
and
mercy
but
as
all
remained
silent
and
as
neither
god
nor
man
nor
yet
the
empress
had
mercy
upon
her
a
wild
rage
took
possession
of
eleonore
s
soul
raising
her
eyes
toward
heaven
with
flaming
glances
she
exclaimed
woe
to
this
merciless
elizabeth
woe
to
this
woman
who
has
no
compassion
for
another
woman
what
she
now
does
to
me
do
thou
also
to
her
my
god
and
lord
grant
that
she
be
flayed
as
she
has
now
flayed
me
grant
her
a
daughter
and
let
that
daughter
before
her
mother
s
eyes
suffer
what
i
now
suffer
o
my
god
woe
to
elizabeth
and
woe
to
you
ye
cowardly
slaves
who
can
look
on
and
see
a
woman
flayed
and
tortured
shame
and
perdition
to
russia
and
its
empress
elizabeth
these
were
eleonore
s
last
words
with
a
wild
rage
her
executioners
seized
her
for
the
purpose
of
tearing
out
her
tongue
and
when
that
was
accomplished
and
her
husband
and
son
had
suffered
a
similar
martyrdom
all
three
were
placed
upon
a
to
be
conveyed
to
siberia
eleonore
could
no
longer
speak
with
her
tongue
but
her
eyes
spoke
and
those
eyes
continued
to
repeat
the
prayer
for
vengeance
she
had
addressed
to
heaven
grant
to
this
empress
elizabeth
a
daughter
and
let
that
daughter
s
sufferings
be
like
a
wedding
the
people
dispersed
the
great
returned
to
their
palaces
and
also
alexis
razumovsky
who
that
he
might
not
excite
the
anger
of
the
empress
had
likewise
attended
the
execution
returned
to
the
imperial
palace
elizabeth
was
standing
before
a
large
venetian
mirror
scrutinizing
a
toilet
which
she
had
changed
for
the
fourth
time
well
she
asked
of
alexis
as
he
entered
was
it
an
interesting
spectacle
was
the
handsome
countess
soundly
whipped
and
while
so
asking
she
was
smilingly
occupied
in
attaching
a
purple
flower
to
her
hair
she
was
flayed
laconically
replied
alexis
her
blood
streamed
down
a
back
that
was
as
red
as
your
beautiful
lips
elizabeth
offered
him
her
lips
to
kiss
now
she
jestingly
asked
who
is
now
the
handsomest
woman
in
my
realm
you
are
and
always
were
responded
alexis
embracing
her
and
now
tell
me
said
she
with
curiosity
what
did
this
proud
countess
do
how
did
she
behave
what
did
she
say
alexis
seating
himself
upon
a
tabouret
at
her
feet
related
to
her
all
about
the
fair
eleonore
and
what
a
terrible
curse
she
uttered
ah
nonsense
replied
elizabeth
shrugging
her
shoulders
how
can
one
make
such
a
stupid
prayer
to
god
i
shall
never
marry
and
therefore
never
have
a
daughter
to
be
scourged
with
the
but
while
thus
speaking
her
eyes
suddenly
became
fixed
and
her
cheek
pale
she
laid
her
trembling
hand
upon
her
heart
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
under
her
heart
she
had
felt
a
movement
of
a
new
and
mysterious
life
heaven
itself
seemed
to
contradict
her
words
elizabeth
felt
that
she
was
a
mother
and
eleonore
s
words
now
filled
her
with
awe
and
terror
fainting
she
sank
into
razumovsky
s
arms
a
few
weeks
later
a
great
and
magnificent
court
festival
was
celebrated
at
the
imperial
palace
at
petersburg
it
was
not
enough
that
elizabeth
had
chosen
a
successor
in
the
person
of
peter
duke
of
holstein
she
must
also
give
this
successor
a
wife
that
the
throne
might
be
fortified
and
assured
by
a
numerous
progeny
she
chose
for
him
the
princess
of
the
young
and
beautiful
sophia
augusta
who
embracing
the
greek
religion
received
the
name
of
catharine
it
was
the
marriage
festival
of
this
young
german
princess
with
the
heir
to
the
russian
throne
which
was
celebrated
in
the
imperial
palace
at
petersburg
a
festival
of
splendor
and
enthusiasm
as
it
was
attended
by
two
women
of
the
most
exciting
beauty
elizabeth
the
present
and
catharine
the
future
empress
the
one
gorgeous
with
the
splendor
of
the
present
the
other
irradiated
with
the
glory
of
the
future
people
looked
at
the
fair
youthful
face
of
catharine
and
sought
to
read
in
her
majestic
high
forehead
the
hopes
that
russia
might
cherish
of
her
it
was
therefore
a
festival
of
the
present
and
future
that
was
there
and
then
celebrated
and
the
magnates
humbly
prostrated
themselves
before
this
new
star
and
threw
themselves
upon
the
earth
before
the
sun
of
imperial
majesty
which
shone
upon
them
in
the
person
of
elizabeth
catharine
with
a
joyful
spirit
and
a
proud
smile
laid
her
hand
in
that
of
peter
and
as
she
stepped
with
him
to
the
altar
she
thought
i
do
this
that
i
may
one
day
be
empress
and
as
i
can
reach
that
position
in
no
other
way
well
then
let
them
call
me
the
wife
of
this
boy
i
will
suffer
it
until
the
time
when
i
shall
no
longer
suffer
but
with
such
thoughts
did
catharine
become
the
wife
of
the
peter
who
as
he
with
a
loud
and
solemn
yes
vowed
eternal
truth
to
his
young
wife
looked
at
the
countess
woronzow
and
both
exchanged
a
stolen
smile
and
a
glowing
glance
of
love
they
may
henceforth
call
this
proud
catharine
my
wife
thought
peter
but
i
shall
never
love
her
as
my
heart
will
ever
belong
to
my
dear
woronzow
but
elizabeth
has
decided
that
catharine
shall
be
my
wife
i
accommodate
myself
to
her
command
and
obey
now
that
i
may
one
day
command
but
then
woe
to
the
wife
this
day
forced
upon
me
and
when
the
ceremony
was
ended
the
pair
received
with
smiling
faces
and
radiant
glances
the
congratulations
of
the
court
which
in
loud
and
ecstatic
exclamations
commended
the
love
and
happiness
of
this
young
princely
pair
on
the
same
day
a
second
marriage
was
celebrated
in
this
same
imperial
palace
perhaps
not
so
splendid
but
certainly
a
happier
one
for
it
was
love
that
united
the
two
love
had
overcome
elizabeth
s
aversion
to
marriage
and
decided
her
to
raise
her
dear
alexis
razumovsky
to
the
position
of
her
husband
love
and
also
a
little
superstition
as
the
son
born
to
elizabeth
some
months
previously
had
died
soon
after
its
birth
and
in
this
dispensation
elizabeth
recognized
the
punishment
of
heaven
in
disapproval
of
her
connection
with
alexis
she
shudderingly
remembered
the
words
spoken
by
eleonore
lapuschkin
and
her
heart
was
filled
with
fear
for
the
children
which
the
future
might
bring
her
i
will
destroy
the
curse
which
this
countess
lapuschkin
has
pronounced
against
my
children
thought
elizabeth
as
she
now
for
the
second
time
felt
herself
to
be
a
mother
if
god
blesses
my
children
the
curse
of
no
human
being
can
affect
them
and
this
revengeful
prayer
of
the
countess
will
have
no
more
power
when
the
priest
of
god
has
consented
and
blessed
the
child
now
quietly
reposing
under
my
heart
this
was
the
reason
why
elizabeth
resolved
to
marry
alexis
razumovsky
this
was
the
reason
why
she
in
a
solitary
chapel
accompanied
only
by
lestocq
and
the
priest
stood
before
the
with
alexis
and
became
his
wife
she
breathed
freer
when
the
priest
had
pronounced
his
blessing
upon
her
an
oppressive
weight
was
lifted
from
her
heart
the
child
she
was
about
to
bear
was
saved
and
sheltered
and
eleonore
s
curse
had
no
longer
any
power
over
it
on
the
next
day
elizabeth
appointed
alexis
and
raised
him
in
the
ranks
of
the
nobility
we
must
at
any
rate
give
our
son
a
respectable
father
said
she
i
hope
we
shall
have
a
son
who
will
be
as
beautiful
as
his
father
whom
i
will
overload
with
honors
and
place
high
above
all
the
magnates
of
my
court
ah
a
son
no
daughter
alexis
and
why
no
daughter
smilingly
asked
razumovsky
elizabeth
shuddered
and
clinging
to
her
beloved
whispered
has
not
eleonore
lapuschkin
said
give
her
a
daughter
and
let
her
before
the
eyes
of
her
mother
experience
what
i
now
suffer
oh
alexis
wish
me
therefore
no
daughter
i
shall
always
tremble
for
her
and
god
seemed
to
have
listened
to
the
anxious
prayer
of
the
empress
again
she
bore
a
son
but
again
the
son
died
shortly
after
his
birth
it
is
very
sad
to
lose
a
child
and
especially
a
son
sighed
elizabeth
and
involuntarily
she
thought
of
anna
that
poor
mother
whom
she
had
robbed
of
her
son
that
he
might
grow
up
in
eternal
joyless
imprisonment
that
he
might
be
morally
murdered
and
from
a
man
be
converted
into
an
idiot
this
is
god
s
vengeance
whispered
something
in
her
breast
but
elizabeth
shrank
from
these
low
whisperings
of
her
conscience
and
she
tremulously
said
i
will
not
listen
to
it
away
ye
intrusive
thoughts
i
am
an
empress
for
me
there
are
no
crimes
no
laws
an
empress
is
exalted
above
all
law
and
whatever
she
does
is
right
away
away
therefore
ye
troublesome
thoughts
this
boy
ivan
must
remain
in
prison
i
can
not
restore
him
to
his
mother
may
she
bear
other
children
and
then
new
joys
will
bloom
for
her
but
these
thoughts
would
not
be
thus
be
banished
they
constantly
haunted
her
they
left
not
her
nightly
couch
they
constantly
renewed
their
dismal
awful
whisperings
and
this
empress
would
loudly
shriek
with
mortal
anguish
and
she
was
dismayed
at
being
left
alone
with
her
thoughts
i
will
have
society
around
me
said
she
and
will
never
be
alone
the
people
about
me
shall
always
laugh
and
jest
to
cheer
me
and
distract
my
thoughts
hasten
hasten
call
my
court
the
most
jovial
men
shall
be
most
welcome
and
do
you
hear
above
all
things
bring
me
wine
the
best
and
strongest
wine
when
i
drink
plenty
of
it
i
shall
again
become
gay
and
happy
it
drives
away
all
cares
and
renders
the
heart
light
and
free
and
they
came
the
merriest
gentlemen
of
the
court
it
also
came
the
strong
fiery
wine
and
after
an
hour
elizabeth
s
brow
beamed
with
renewed
pleasure
while
her
heavy
tongue
with
difficulty
stammered
how
beautiful
it
yet
is
to
be
an
empress
for
an
empress
there
is
only
joy
and
delight
and
endless
pleasures
scenes
and
portraits
years
passed
famous
and
glorious
years
for
russia
peace
within
her
borders
and
splendid
victories
gained
over
foreign
enemies
particularly
over
the
prussians
in
songs
of
jubilee
the
people
praised
and
blessed
their
empress
whose
wisdom
had
brought
all
to
such
a
glorious
conclusion
and
had
made
her
country
great
triumphant
and
happy
the
good
elizabeth
what
had
she
to
do
with
the
victories
of
her
soldiers
with
the
happiness
of
her
realm
she
knew
nothing
of
it
and
if
peace
prevailed
throughout
the
russian
empire
it
was
absolutely
unknown
in
the
imperial
palace
where
there
was
eternal
war
a
feud
there
the
young
catharine
contended
with
her
husband
whom
she
hated
and
abhorred
with
elizabeth
who
saw
in
her
a
dangerous
rival
but
it
was
an
unequal
struggle
in
which
these
two
women
were
engaged
for
elizabeth
had
on
her
side
the
power
and
dominion
while
catharine
had
only
her
youth
her
beauty
and
her
tears
elizabeth
hated
catharine
because
she
dared
to
remain
young
and
handsome
while
she
the
empress
saw
that
she
was
growing
old
and
her
charms
were
withering
and
catharine
hated
elizabeth
because
the
latter
denied
her
a
right
which
the
empress
daily
claimed
for
herself
the
right
to
choose
a
lover
and
to
love
him
as
long
as
he
pleased
her
she
hated
elizabeth
because
the
latter
surrounded
her
with
spies
and
watchers
and
required
of
her
a
strict
virtue
a
matrimonial
fidelity
fidelity
to
the
husband
who
so
far
derided
and
insulted
his
wife
as
to
demand
that
she
should
receive
into
her
circle
and
treat
with
respect
and
kindness
his
own
mistress
the
countess
woronzow
fidelity
to
this
husband
who
had
never
shown
her
any
thing
but
contempt
and
neglect
and
who
had
no
other
way
of
entertaining
her
than
teaching
her
to
march
in
military
fashion
and
stand
as
a
sentinel
at
his
door
wounded
in
her
inmost
being
and
her
feminine
honor
tired
of
the
eternal
with
which
elizabeth
tormented
her
catharine
retreated
into
her
most
retired
apartment
there
in
quiet
to
reflect
upon
her
dishonorable
greatness
and
yearningly
to
dream
of
a
splendid
future
for
the
future
said
she
with
sparkling
eyes
to
her
confidante
princess
daschkow
the
future
is
mine
they
can
not
deprive
me
of
it
for
that
i
labor
and
think
and
study
ah
when
future
shall
have
become
the
present
then
will
i
encircle
my
brows
with
a
splendid
imperial
diadem
and
astonish
you
with
all
my
greatness
and
but
you
forget
your
husband
smilingly
interposed
princess
daschkow
he
will
a
little
obscure
the
splendor
of
your
imperial
crown
as
he
will
always
be
the
first
in
the
realm
he
is
the
emperor
and
you
will
be
powerless
although
an
empress
catharine
proudly
tossed
her
head
and
her
eyes
flashed
i
shall
one
day
remember
all
the
mortifications
he
has
inflicted
upon
me
said
she
and
an
hour
will
come
when
i
shall
have
a
reckoning
with
him
and
full
retribution
ah
talk
not
to
me
of
my
husband
russian
emperors
have
never
been
immortal
and
why
should
he
be
so
catharine
exclaimed
the
princess
daschkow
turning
pale
you
can
not
think
i
think
interposed
catharine
with
an
unnatural
smile
i
think
the
russian
emperors
are
not
immortal
and
that
this
good
empress
elizabeth
is
very
fortunate
in
having
no
emperor
who
presumes
to
stand
over
her
and
have
a
will
more
potent
than
her
own
ah
elizabeth
has
no
will
at
all
laughingly
responded
the
princess
but
i
shall
have
a
will
said
catharine
proudly
the
princess
daschkow
had
spoken
the
truth
elizabeth
had
no
longer
any
will
she
let
bestuscheff
govern
and
was
herself
ruled
by
alexis
razumovsky
the
her
husband
she
did
whatever
these
two
required
willingly
yielding
to
them
in
all
cases
demanding
no
personal
effort
on
her
part
on
this
point
only
had
she
a
will
of
her
own
which
she
carried
through
with
an
iron
hand
i
have
not
become
empress
that
i
might
labor
but
that
i
might
amuse
myself
said
she
i
have
not
set
the
crown
upon
my
head
for
the
purpose
of
governing
but
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
life
spare
me
therefore
the
labor
of
signing
your
documents
i
will
sign
nothing
more
for
my
hand
is
not
accustomed
to
holding
the
pen
and
the
ink
soils
my
fingers
which
is
unworthy
of
an
empress
it
is
only
one
signature
that
i
implore
of
you
said
bestuscheff
handing
her
a
letter
have
the
great
kindness
to
make
an
exception
of
this
one
single
case
by
signing
this
letter
to
king
louis
xv
of
what
have
i
to
write
to
this
king
of
france
fretfully
asked
elizabeth
why
should
i
do
it
it
is
a
long
time
since
he
has
sent
me
any
new
dresses
although
he
might
well
know
that
nothing
is
more
important
for
an
empress
than
a
splendid
and
varied
wardrobe
why
then
should
i
write
to
this
king
of
france
you
majesty
it
is
here
question
of
a
simple
act
of
courtesy
said
bestuscheff
pressingly
an
act
the
omission
of
which
may
be
attended
with
the
most
disagreeable
consequences
perhaps
indeed
involve
us
in
a
war
think
of
the
peace
of
your
realm
the
welfare
of
your
people
and
sign
this
letter
but
what
does
it
contain
that
is
so
important
asked
the
empress
with
astonishment
i
now
remember
that
for
a
year
past
you
have
been
importuning
me
about
this
yes
your
majesty
i
have
been
for
the
last
three
years
daily
imploring
of
you
this
signature
and
you
have
refused
it
to
me
and
yet
the
letter
is
so
necessary
it
is
against
all
propriety
not
to
send
it
for
it
is
a
letter
of
congratulation
to
the
king
of
france
who
in
an
autograph
letter
announced
to
you
the
birth
of
his
grandson
reflect
your
majesty
that
he
wrote
you
with
his
own
hand
and
for
three
years
you
have
refused
to
give
yourself
the
small
trouble
to
sign
the
answer
i
have
prepared
this
prince
for
whose
birth
you
are
to
congratulate
the
king
is
now
old
enough
to
express
his
own
thanks
for
the
sympathy
you
manifest
for
elizabeth
laughed
well
said
she
i
shall
finally
be
obliged
to
comply
with
your
wishes
that
you
may
leave
me
in
peace
for
three
years
i
have
patiently
borne
your
importunities
for
this
signature
my
patience
is
now
at
an
end
and
i
will
sign
the
letter
that
i
may
be
freed
from
your
solicitations
give
me
therefore
that
intolerable
pen
but
first
pour
out
a
glass
of
malvoisie
and
hold
it
ready
that
i
may
strengthen
myself
with
it
after
the
labor
is
elizabeth
sighing
took
the
pen
and
slowly
and
anxiously
subscribed
her
name
to
this
letter
of
congratulation
to
the
king
of
france
so
said
she
throwing
down
her
pen
after
the
completion
of
her
task
so
but
you
must
not
for
a
long
time
again
trouble
me
with
any
such
work
and
i
have
well
earned
the
right
to
a
very
pleasant
evening
nothing
more
of
business
no
no
not
a
word
more
of
it
i
will
not
have
these
delightful
hours
embittered
by
your
absurdities
away
with
you
bestuscheff
and
let
my
count
razumovsky
be
called
and
when
alexis
came
elizabeth
smilingly
said
to
him
alexis
the
air
is
so
fine
and
fresh
that
we
will
take
a
ride
quick
quick
and
know
you
where
razumovsky
nodded
to
the
villa
said
he
with
a
smile
yes
to
the
villa
cried
elizabeth
to
see
my
daughter
at
the
villa
she
therefore
now
had
a
daughter
and
this
daughter
had
not
died
like
her
two
sons
she
lived
she
throve
in
the
freshness
of
childhood
and
elizabeth
loved
her
with
idolatrous
tenderness
but
precisely
on
account
of
this
tenderness
did
she
carefully
conceal
the
existence
of
this
daughter
keeping
her
far
from
the
world
ignorant
of
her
high
birth
unsuspicious
of
her
mother
s
greatness
the
fatal
words
of
the
countess
lapuschkin
still
resounded
in
the
ears
of
the
empress
give
this
elizabeth
a
daughter
and
let
that
daughter
experience
what
i
now
suffer
such
had
been
the
prayer
of
the
bleeding
countess
flayed
by
the
executioners
of
the
empress
and
the
words
were
continually
echoing
in
elizabeth
s
heart
ah
she
was
indeed
a
lofty
empress
she
had
the
power
to
banish
thousands
to
siberia
and
was
yet
so
powerless
that
she
could
not
banish
those
words
from
her
mind
which
eleonore
lapuschkin
had
planted
there
eleonore
was
therefore
avenged
and
while
the
countess
bore
the
torments
of
her
banishment
with
smiling
fortitude
elizabeth
trembled
on
her
throne
at
the
words
of
her
banished
rival
words
that
seemed
to
hang
like
the
sword
of
damocles
over
the
head
of
her
daughter
perhaps
it
was
precisely
for
the
reason
that
she
so
much
feared
for
her
daughter
that
she
loved
her
so
very
warmly
it
was
a
passionate
an
adoring
tenderness
that
she
felt
for
the
child
and
nevertheless
she
had
the
courage
to
keep
her
at
a
distance
from
herself
to
see
her
but
seldom
that
no
one
might
suspect
the
secret
of
her
birth
eleonore
s
words
had
brought
reflection
to
elizabeth
she
comprehended
that
her
legitimate
daughter
would
certainly
be
threatened
with
great
dangers
after
her
death
she
had
shudderingly
thought
of
poor
ivan
in
schlusselburg
and
she
said
to
herself
as
i
have
held
him
imprisoned
as
a
pretender
so
may
it
happen
to
my
daughter
one
day
when
i
am
no
more
ivan
had
but
a
doubtful
right
to
my
throne
but
natalie
is
indisputably
the
of
peter
the
great
the
blood
of
the
great
russian
czar
flows
in
her
veins
and
therefore
peter
will
fear
natalie
as
i
feared
ivan
therefore
will
he
imprison
and
torment
her
as
i
have
imprisoned
and
tormented
ivan
by
this
affectionate
anxiety
was
elizabeth
induced
to
make
a
secret
of
the
existence
of
her
daughter
which
was
imparted
to
but
a
few
confidential
friends
the
little
natalie
was
raised
in
a
solitary
not
far
from
the
city
and
her
few
servants
and
people
were
forbidden
under
pain
of
death
to
admit
any
stranger
into
this
and
house
no
one
was
to
enter
it
without
a
written
order
of
the
empress
and
but
few
such
written
orders
were
given
elizabeth
then
as
it
were
to
recompense
herself
for
the
trouble
of
signing
the
letter
to
the
king
of
france
resolved
to
visit
her
daughter
with
her
husband
rasczinsky
may
precede
and
announce
us
said
she
we
will
take
our
dinner
there
and
he
may
say
to
our
that
we
are
going
to
peterhoff
then
no
one
will
be
surprised
that
we
make
a
short
halt
at
my
little
villa
in
passing
or
rather
they
will
know
nothing
of
it
call
rasczinsky
count
rasczinsky
was
one
of
the
few
who
were
acquainted
with
the
secret
and
might
accompany
the
empress
in
these
visits
elizabeth
had
unlimited
confidence
in
him
she
knew
him
to
be
a
silent
nobleman
and
she
estimated
him
the
more
highly
from
the
fact
that
he
seemed
much
attached
to
the
charming
beautiful
and
delicate
child
her
daughter
she
remarked
that
he
appeared
to
love
her
as
a
brother
that
he
constantly
and
fondly
watched
over
her
and
that
he
was
never
better
pleased
than
when
as
a
child
he
could
jest
and
play
with
her
rasczinsky
we
are
about
to
ride
out
to
the
villa
on
a
visit
to
natalie
she
said
when
the
count
entered
the
count
s
eyes
beamed
with
pleasure
and
i
may
be
permitted
to
accompany
your
majesty
he
hastily
asked
the
empress
smiled
how
impetuous
you
are
said
she
would
not
one
think
you
were
a
dying
lover
a
sighing
shepherd
and
it
was
a
question
of
seeking
your
tender
shepherdess
instead
of
announcing
to
a
child
of
eleven
years
the
speedy
arrival
of
her
mother
your
majesty
said
count
rasczinsky
laughing
i
am
not
in
love
but
i
adore
this
child
as
my
good
angel
i
can
never
do
or
think
any
thing
bad
in
natalie
s
presence
she
is
so
pure
and
innocent
that
one
casts
down
his
eyes
with
shame
before
her
and
when
she
glances
at
me
with
her
large
deep
and
yet
so
childish
eyes
i
could
directly
fall
upon
my
knees
and
confess
to
her
all
my
sins
you
would
not
have
many
to
confess
said
elizabeth
for
your
sins
are
few
you
are
the
pride
of
my
court
and
as
i
am
told
a
true
pattern
of
all
knightly
virtues
remain
so
and
who
knows
my
fair
young
count
what
the
future
may
bring
you
love
my
natalie
now
only
as
an
angel
of
innocence
let
her
grow
up
as
such
and
then
and
then
asked
the
count
as
the
empress
stopped
then
we
shall
see
smilingly
responded
elizabeth
but
now
hasten
forward
to
announce
your
majesty
forgets
that
to
enable
one
to
penetrate
into
this
enchanted
castle
your
written
command
is
required
ah
that
is
true
said
elizabeth
stepping
to
her
this
time
she
was
not
too
indolent
to
write
no
representations
nor
prayers
were
needed
it
concerned
the
seeing
of
her
daughter
how
then
could
she
have
thought
writing
painful
or
troublesome
with
the
same
pen
with
which
a
short
time
before
she
had
so
unwillingly
signed
the
congratulatory
letter
she
now
wrote
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
provided
with
her
seal
these
words
the
count
rasczinsky
may
be
admitted
she
handed
the
paper
to
the
count
who
pressed
it
to
his
lips
you
can
retain
this
paper
for
all
time
said
the
empress
as
she
dismissed
him
i
know
that
i
can
wholly
confide
in
you
you
will
never
sell
or
betray
my
natalie
never
protested
the
count
taking
his
leave
hastily
mounting
his
horse
he
galloped
through
the
streets
and
when
having
left
the
city
behind
him
he
found
himself
in
the
open
country
where
no
one
could
observe
him
he
drew
the
paper
elizabeth
had
given
him
from
his
bosom
and
waving
it
high
in
the
air
shouted
good
fortune
good
fortune
this
paper
is
my
talisman
and
my
future
with
this
paper
i
will
give
russia
an
empress
and
make
myself
her
emperor
princes
also
must
die
yes
even
princes
must
die
glorious
and
lofty
as
they
are
proudly
as
they
stand
over
their
trembling
subjects
even
to
them
comes
the
dark
hour
in
which
all
the
borrowed
and
tinsel
of
their
lives
falls
from
them
a
dark
hour
in
which
they
tremble
and
repent
and
pray
to
god
for
what
they
seldom
granted
to
their
mercy
mercy
for
those
false
tales
which
they
have
imposed
upon
the
people
for
those
false
tales
of
the
higher
endowments
of
princes
of
inherited
wisdom
which
raises
them
above
the
rest
of
mankind
mercy
for
their
arbitrariness
their
pride
and
their
insolence
mercy
for
a
poor
beggar
who
until
then
had
called
himself
a
rich
and
powerful
prince
and
this
hour
came
for
elizabeth
after
twenty
years
of
splendor
of
absolute
unlimited
power
of
infallibility
of
likeness
to
the
gods
came
the
depressing
hour
in
which
elizabeth
ceased
to
be
an
empress
and
became
only
a
trembling
imploring
mercy
aid
amelioration
of
her
sufferings
from
her
creator
she
suffered
much
this
poor
empress
dethroned
by
death
she
suffered
although
reposing
upon
silken
cushions
with
a
covering
for
her
shaking
limbs
and
she
was
yet
so
young
hardly
fifty
and
she
loved
life
so
intensely
oh
she
would
have
given
half
of
her
empire
for
a
few
more
years
of
life
and
enjoyment
but
what
cares
death
for
the
wishes
of
an
empress
here
ends
her
earthly
supremacy
groaning
and
writhing
the
tremblingly
submits
where
now
were
all
her
favorites
those
high
lords
of
the
court
those
grand
noblemen
created
from
soldiers
grooms
lackeys
and
serfs
where
were
they
now
why
stood
they
not
around
the
of
their
empress
why
were
they
not
there
that
the
remembrance
of
the
benefits
conferred
upon
them
might
drive
away
those
terrible
reminiscences
of
the
torments
she
had
inflicted
upon
others
where
were
they
her
counts
barons
and
privy
councillors
whom
she
had
raised
from
nothing
to
the
first
positions
in
the
realm
none
were
with
her
they
had
all
hastened
thence
for
the
preservation
of
their
wealth
to
crawl
in
the
dust
before
peter
to
be
the
first
to
pay
him
homage
that
he
might
pardon
their
greatness
and
their
possessions
from
the
they
had
fled
to
peter
and
kneeling
before
him
they
praised
god
for
at
length
bestowing
upon
the
happy
realm
the
noblest
and
best
ruler
peter
but
where
were
elizabeth
s
more
particular
friends
who
had
made
her
an
empress
where
was
lestocq
him
the
empress
had
banished
to
siberia
yielding
to
the
prayers
and
calumnies
of
his
enemies
which
she
was
too
weak
to
withstand
she
had
given
him
up
she
had
sacrificed
him
to
procure
peace
and
quiet
for
herself
and
in
the
same
hour
in
which
she
had
tenderly
pressed
his
hand
and
called
him
her
friend
had
she
signed
his
sentence
of
banishment
lestocq
had
for
nine
years
languished
in
siberia
where
was
grunstein
banished
cast
off
like
lestocq
where
was
alexis
razumovsky
ah
well
for
her
he
stood
at
her
bedside
he
pressed
her
cold
hand
in
his
he
yet
in
the
face
of
death
thanked
her
for
all
the
benefits
she
had
heaped
upon
him
but
alas
she
was
also
surrounded
by
others
by
wild
pale
terrible
forms
which
were
unseen
by
all
except
the
dying
empress
she
there
saw
the
tortured
face
of
anna
leopoldowna
whom
she
had
let
die
in
prison
there
grinned
at
her
the
idiotic
face
of
ivan
whose
mind
she
had
destroyed
there
saw
she
the
eyes
and
bloody
form
of
eleonore
lapuschkin
and
springing
up
from
her
bed
the
empress
screeched
with
terror
and
folded
her
trembling
hands
in
prayer
to
god
for
grace
and
mercy
for
her
daughter
for
natalie
that
he
would
turn
away
the
horrible
curse
that
eleonore
had
hurled
at
her
child
alexis
razumovsky
stood
by
her
bedside
weeping
overcome
as
it
seemed
by
his
sorrow
another
left
the
of
the
empress
and
rushed
to
his
horse
standing
ready
in
the
court
below
this
other
was
count
rasczinsky
the
confidant
of
the
empress
the
bells
rang
in
petersburg
the
cannon
roared
there
were
both
joy
and
sorrow
in
what
the
bells
and
cannon
announced
the
empress
elizabeth
was
dead
the
emperor
peter
iii
ascended
the
throne
of
the
czars
as
absolute
ruler
of
the
russian
realm
the
first
to
bow
before
him
was
his
wife
with
her
son
of
five
years
old
in
her
arms
she
had
thrown
herself
upon
her
knees
and
touching
the
floor
with
her
forehead
she
had
implored
grace
and
love
for
herself
and
her
son
and
peter
raising
her
up
had
presented
her
to
the
people
as
his
empress
in
petersburg
the
bells
rang
the
cannon
thundered
the
empress
is
dead
long
live
the
emperor
before
the
villa
stopped
a
steed
from
which
dismounted
a
horseman
who
knocked
at
the
closed
door
to
the
porter
who
looked
out
from
a
sliding
window
he
showed
the
written
order
of
elizabeth
for
his
admission
the
porter
opened
the
door
and
with
the
loud
cry
natalie
natalie
the
count
rasczinsky
rushed
into
the
hall
of
the
house
the
bells
continued
to
ring
the
cannon
to
thunder
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
petersburg
issuing
from
the
villa
count
rasczinsky
again
mounted
his
foaming
steed
like
a
swept
he
over
the
plain
but
not
toward
petersburg
not
toward
the
city
where
the
people
were
saluting
their
new
emperor
away
away
far
and
wide
in
the
distance
his
horse
bounded
and
panted
bleeding
with
the
spurs
of
his
rider
excited
constantly
to
new
speed
he
as
constantly
bounds
onward
like
a
nocturnal
spectre
flies
he
through
the
desert
waste
the
drives
him
forward
it
lifts
the
mantle
that
enwraps
him
like
a
cloud
and
under
that
mantle
is
seen
an
the
smile
of
a
delicate
little
girl
two
tender
childish
arms
clasping
the
form
of
the
count
a
slight
elfish
form
tremblingly
reposing
upon
the
count
s
breast
you
weep
not
my
angel
whispered
the
count
while
rushing
forward
with
restless
haste
no
no
i
neither
weep
nor
tremble
for
i
am
with
you
breathed
a
sweet
childish
voice
cling
closer
to
me
my
sweet
blossom
recline
your
head
against
my
breast
see
evening
approaches
night
will
spread
its
protecting
veil
over
us
and
god
will
be
our
conductor
and
safeguard
i
shall
save
you
my
angel
my
charming
child
the
steed
continues
his
onward
course
the
child
smilingly
reclines
upon
the
bosom
of
the
rider
over
whom
the
descending
sun
sheds
its
red
parting
beams
like
a
phantom
flies
he
onward
like
a
phantom
he
disappears
there
on
the
border
of
the
forest
was
it
only
a
delusive
appearance
a
of
the
desert
no
again
and
again
the
evening
breeze
raises
the
mantle
of
the
rider
and
the
charming
angelic
brow
is
still
seen
resting
upon
the
bosom
of
the
count
no
it
is
no
dream
it
is
truth
and
reality
like
a
flies
the
count
over
hill
and
heath
and
on
his
bosom
reposes
natalie
daughter
of
the
the
charmed
garden
one
must
be
very
happy
or
very
unhappy
to
love
solitude
to
lean
upon
her
silent
breast
and
fleeing
mankind
to
seek
in
its
arms
what
is
so
seldom
found
among
men
repose
for
happiness
or
consolation
for
sorrow
for
the
happy
solitude
provides
the
most
delightful
festival
as
it
allows
one
in
the
most
enjoyable
resignation
to
repose
in
himself
to
breathe
out
himself
to
participate
in
himself
but
it
also
provides
a
festival
for
the
unhappy
a
festival
of
the
memory
of
living
in
the
past
of
reflection
upon
those
vanished
joys
the
loss
of
which
has
caused
the
sorrow
for
the
children
of
the
world
for
the
striving
for
the
seeker
of
inordinate
enjoyments
for
the
ambitious
for
the
sensual
solitude
is
but
only
for
the
happy
for
the
and
also
for
the
innocent
who
yet
know
nothing
of
the
world
of
neither
its
pleasures
nor
torments
of
neither
its
loves
nor
hatreds
so
thought
and
spoke
the
curious
romans
when
passing
the
high
walls
surrounding
the
beautiful
garden
formerly
belonging
to
the
count
appiani
at
an
earlier
period
this
garden
had
been
well
known
to
all
of
them
as
it
had
been
a
sort
of
public
promenade
and
under
its
shady
walks
had
many
a
tender
couple
exchanged
their
first
vows
and
experienced
the
rapture
of
the
first
kiss
of
love
but
for
the
four
last
years
all
this
had
been
changed
a
rich
stranger
had
come
and
offered
to
the
impoverished
old
count
appiani
a
large
sum
for
this
garden
with
its
decaying
villa
and
the
count
had
notwithstanding
the
murmurs
of
the
romans
sold
his
last
possession
to
the
stranger
he
had
said
to
the
grumbling
romans
you
are
dissatisfied
that
i
part
with
my
garden
for
money
you
were
pleased
to
linger
in
the
shady
avenues
to
listen
to
these
murmuring
fountains
and
rustling
cypresses
you
have
walked
here
you
have
here
laughed
and
enjoyed
yourselves
while
i
sitting
in
my
dilapidated
villa
have
suffered
deprivation
and
hunger
i
will
make
you
a
proposition
collect
this
sum
you
romans
which
this
stranger
offers
me
ye
who
love
to
promenade
in
my
garden
unite
yourselves
in
a
common
work
let
each
one
give
what
he
can
until
the
necessary
amount
is
collected
then
the
garden
will
be
your
common
property
where
you
can
walk
as
much
as
you
please
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
be
relieved
from
poverty
by
my
own
countrymen
and
not
compelled
to
sell
to
a
stranger
the
garden
so
agreeable
to
the
romans
but
the
good
romans
had
no
answer
to
make
to
count
appiani
they
indeed
would
have
the
enjoyment
but
it
must
cost
them
nothing
in
vain
had
they
very
much
loved
this
garden
had
taken
great
pleasure
under
its
shady
trees
but
when
it
became
necessary
to
pay
for
these
pleasures
they
found
that
they
were
not
worth
the
cost
that
they
could
very
well
dispense
with
them
the
good
romans
therefore
turned
away
from
this
garden
which
threatened
them
with
a
tax
and
sought
other
places
of
recreation
while
old
count
appiani
sold
his
garden
and
the
ruins
of
his
villa
to
the
rich
stranger
who
had
offered
him
so
considerable
a
sum
for
them
from
that
day
forward
every
thing
in
the
garden
had
assumed
a
different
appearance
masons
carpenters
and
upholsterers
had
come
and
so
improved
the
villa
within
and
without
that
it
now
made
a
stately
and
beautiful
appearance
amid
the
dense
foliage
of
the
trees
it
had
been
expensively
and
splendidly
furnished
with
every
thing
desirable
for
a
rich
man
s
dwelling
and
the
upholsterers
had
enough
to
relate
to
the
listening
romans
of
the
elegant
magnificence
now
displayed
in
this
formerly
pitiable
villa
how
gladly
would
the
former
promenaders
now
have
returned
to
this
garden
how
gladly
would
they
now
have
revisited
this
villa
which
with
its
deserted
halls
and
its
ragged
and
dirty
tapestry
had
formerly
seemed
to
them
not
worth
looking
at
but
their
return
to
it
was
now
rendered
impossible
for
on
the
same
day
in
which
the
new
owner
took
possession
of
the
garden
he
had
brought
with
him
more
than
fifty
workmen
who
had
immediately
commenced
surrounding
it
with
a
high
wall
higher
and
higher
rose
the
wall
nobody
could
see
over
it
as
no
giant
was
sufficiently
tall
no
one
could
climb
over
it
as
the
stones
of
which
it
was
built
offered
not
the
least
supporting
point
the
garden
with
its
villa
had
become
a
secret
mystery
to
the
romans
they
yet
heard
the
rustling
of
the
trees
they
saw
the
green
branches
waving
in
the
wind
but
of
what
occurred
under
those
branches
and
in
those
shaded
walks
they
could
know
nothing
at
first
some
curious
individuals
had
ventured
to
knock
at
the
low
narrow
door
that
formed
the
only
entrance
into
this
walled
garden
they
had
knocked
at
that
door
and
demanded
entrance
then
would
a
small
sliding
window
be
opened
and
a
gruff
bearded
man
with
angry
voice
would
ask
what
was
wanted
and
at
the
same
time
inform
the
knocker
that
no
one
could
be
admitted
that
he
and
his
two
bulldogs
would
be
able
to
keep
the
garden
clear
of
all
intruders
and
the
two
great
hounds
as
if
they
understood
the
threats
of
their
master
would
show
their
teeth
and
their
threatening
growl
would
rise
to
a
loud
and
angry
bark
they
soon
ceased
to
knock
at
that
door
and
as
they
could
not
gain
admission
they
took
the
next
best
course
of
assuming
the
appearance
of
not
wishing
it
four
years
had
since
passed
they
had
overcome
the
desire
to
enter
the
premises
or
to
look
over
the
wall
but
they
told
wondrous
tales
of
the
garden
and
of
a
beautiful
fairy
who
dwelt
in
it
and
whose
soft
melodious
voice
was
sometimes
heard
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
singing
sweet
transporting
songs
no
one
had
seen
her
this
fairy
but
she
was
certainly
beautiful
and
of
course
young
there
were
also
some
bold
individuals
who
asserted
that
when
the
moon
shone
brightly
and
goldenly
the
young
fairy
was
then
to
be
seen
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
or
upon
the
edge
of
the
wall
light
as
an
elf
transparent
as
a
moonbeam
she
there
swung
to
and
fro
executing
the
singular
dances
and
singing
songs
that
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
and
compassion
to
the
hearts
of
those
who
heard
them
on
hearing
these
tales
the
romans
would
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
pass
more
quickly
by
the
walls
of
this
garden
which
thenceforth
they
called
charmed
it
was
indeed
a
charmed
garden
it
was
an
island
of
happiness
behind
these
walls
concealed
from
the
knavery
of
the
world
like
an
eternal
smile
of
the
divinity
rested
the
heavens
over
this
garden
in
whose
the
nightingales
sang
and
in
whose
basins
the
goldfishes
splashed
yes
it
was
indeed
a
charmed
garden
and
also
had
its
fairy
who
if
she
did
not
compete
with
the
moonbeams
in
rocking
herself
on
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
the
edges
of
the
wall
was
nevertheless
as
delicate
as
an
elf
and
who
tripped
from
flower
to
brook
and
from
brook
to
hill
as
lightly
and
gracefully
as
the
gazelle
the
whole
spring
the
whole
youth
of
nature
flashed
and
beamed
from
this
beautiful
so
full
of
childlike
innocence
purity
and
peace
no
storm
had
as
yet
passed
over
these
smiling
features
not
the
smallest
leaf
of
this
rose
had
been
touched
by
an
ungentle
hand
freely
and
freshly
had
she
blossomed
in
luxuriant
natural
beauty
she
had
drunk
the
dews
of
heaven
but
not
the
dew
of
tears
for
those
beaming
eyes
had
wept
only
such
tears
as
where
called
forth
by
emotions
of
joy
and
happiness
she
sat
under
a
myrtle
whose
blossoming
branches
bent
down
to
her
as
if
they
would
entwine
that
pure
and
tender
brow
with
a
bridal
wreath
with
her
head
thrown
back
upon
these
branches
she
reposed
with
an
inimitable
grace
her
reclining
form
a
white
transparent
robe
held
by
a
golden
clasp
fell
in
waves
to
her
feet
which
were
encased
in
slippers
of
leather
a
blushing
rose
was
fastened
by
a
diamond
pin
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
upon
her
budding
bosom
finely
contrasting
with
the
delicate
flush
upon
her
cheeks
a
guitar
rested
upon
her
full
round
arm
she
had
been
singing
this
beautiful
fairy
child
but
her
song
was
now
silenced
and
she
was
glancing
up
to
the
clouds
following
their
movements
with
her
dreamy
thoughtful
eyes
a
smile
hovered
about
her
fresh
youthful
lips
the
smile
peculiar
to
innocence
and
happiness
she
dreamed
precious
ecstatic
images
passed
before
her
mental
eyes
she
dreamed
of
a
distant
land
in
which
she
had
once
been
of
a
distant
house
in
which
she
had
once
dwelt
it
was
even
more
beautiful
and
splendid
than
this
which
she
now
occupied
but
it
had
lacked
this
blue
sky
and
fragrant
atmosphere
it
lacked
these
trees
and
flowers
these
myrtle
bushes
and
these
songs
of
the
nightingale
and
upon
a
few
summer
days
had
followed
long
dull
winter
months
with
their
cold
of
snow
with
their
benumbing
masses
of
ice
and
the
fantastic
flowers
painted
on
the
windows
by
the
frost
and
yet
and
yet
there
had
been
a
sun
which
shone
into
her
heart
warmer
than
this
bright
sun
of
italy
and
the
thought
of
which
spread
a
purple
glow
upon
her
cheeks
this
sun
had
shone
upon
her
from
the
tender
glances
of
a
lady
whom
she
had
loved
as
a
tutelar
genius
as
a
divinity
as
the
bright
star
of
her
existence
whenever
that
lady
had
come
to
her
in
the
solitary
house
in
which
she
then
dwelt
then
had
all
appeared
to
her
as
in
a
transfiguration
then
had
even
her
peevish
old
servant
learned
to
smile
and
become
humble
and
friendly
then
all
was
joy
and
happiness
and
whoever
saw
that
beautiful
and
brilliant
lady
had
thought
himself
blessed
and
had
fallen
down
to
adore
her
of
that
lady
was
the
young
maiden
now
thinking
of
that
memorable
woman
with
the
flashing
eyes
whose
tender
glance
had
always
penetrated
the
heart
of
the
child
with
delight
whose
tender
words
yet
resounded
like
music
in
her
ears
where
was
she
now
this
lady
of
her
love
her
longings
why
had
she
been
brought
away
from
that
house
with
its
snowy
and
the
ice
drapery
upon
its
windows
where
lay
that
house
and
where
had
she
to
seek
it
with
her
thoughts
what
was
the
language
she
had
there
spoken
and
which
she
now
secretly
spoke
in
her
heart
although
nobody
else
addressed
her
in
it
no
one
about
her
understood
it
and
wherefore
had
her
friend
and
protector
he
who
had
brought
her
here
who
had
always
been
with
her
wherefore
had
he
suddenly
given
himself
the
appearance
of
no
longer
understanding
it
and
even
as
she
was
thinking
of
him
of
this
dear
friend
and
protector
he
came
along
down
the
alley
his
tall
form
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
walk
she
recognized
his
noble
features
with
the
proud
eagle
glance
and
the
bold
arched
brow
the
young
maiden
arose
from
her
seat
and
hastened
to
meet
him
how
charming
that
you
have
come
paulo
she
gayly
said
stretching
forth
her
little
hands
toward
him
i
must
ask
you
something
and
that
directly
paulo
tell
me
quickly
what
is
that
language
called
in
which
we
formerly
conversed
together
and
why
have
we
ceased
to
speak
it
since
we
came
here
to
rome
paulo
s
brow
became
slightly
clouded
but
when
he
looked
into
her
beautiful
face
animated
by
expectant
curiosity
this
expression
of
displeasure
quickly
vanished
from
his
features
and
threatening
her
with
his
finger
he
said
always
this
same
question
natalie
and
yet
i
have
so
often
begged
of
you
to
forget
the
past
and
live
only
in
the
present
my
dear
sweet
child
the
past
is
sunken
in
an
immeasurable
gulf
behind
you
which
you
can
never
pass
and
if
it
stretches
out
its
arms
to
you
it
will
only
be
for
the
purpose
of
dragging
you
down
into
the
abyss
with
it
forget
it
therefore
my
natalie
and
yield
thyself
to
this
beautiful
and
delightful
present
to
increase
for
you
the
attractions
of
which
will
ever
be
the
dearest
task
of
my
it
is
true
said
the
young
maiden
sighing
i
am
wrong
to
be
always
recurring
to
those
times
you
must
pardon
me
paulo
but
you
will
also
acknowledge
that
my
enigmatical
past
justifies
me
in
feeling
some
curiosity
only
think
how
it
began
you
one
day
came
rushing
to
my
room
you
pressed
me
all
trembling
to
your
heart
and
silently
bore
me
away
natalie
said
you
danger
threatens
you
i
will
save
or
perish
with
you
you
mounted
your
horse
with
me
in
your
arms
behind
us
screamed
and
moaned
the
servants
of
my
house
but
you
regarded
them
not
and
i
trustingly
clung
to
your
heart
for
i
knew
that
if
danger
threatened
me
you
would
surely
save
me
oh
do
you
yet
remember
that
fabulous
ride
how
we
rested
in
houses
or
with
poor
peasant
people
and
then
proceeded
on
farther
and
farther
and
how
the
sun
constantly
grew
warmer
melting
the
snow
and
you
constantly
became
more
cheerful
and
happy
until
one
day
you
impetuously
pressed
me
to
your
bosom
and
said
natalie
we
are
saved
life
and
the
future
are
now
yours
look
around
you
we
are
in
italy
here
you
can
be
free
and
happy
and
was
not
that
a
good
prophecy
asked
paulo
has
it
not
been
fulfilled
are
you
not
happy
i
should
be
so
sighed
natalie
could
i
avoid
thinking
so
often
of
that
past
those
words
which
you
then
spoke
to
me
were
the
last
i
ever
heard
in
that
language
which
i
had
always
spoken
until
then
but
of
which
i
know
not
the
name
from
that
hour
you
spoke
to
me
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
i
felt
like
a
poor
deserted
orphan
from
whom
was
taken
her
last
possession
her
language
and
yet
whole
peoples
have
been
robbed
of
that
last
and
dearest
possession
said
paulo
his
brow
suddenly
darkening
and
not
as
in
your
case
to
save
life
and
liberty
but
for
the
purpose
of
enslaving
and
oppressing
natalie
perceiving
the
sudden
sadness
of
her
friend
attempted
to
smile
and
grasping
his
hand
she
said
come
paulo
we
are
naughty
children
and
vex
ourselves
with
vagaries
while
all
nature
is
so
cheerful
and
so
replete
with
divine
beauty
only
see
with
what
glowing
splendor
the
departing
sun
rests
upon
the
tops
of
the
cypresses
ah
it
is
nowhere
so
beautiful
as
here
in
my
dear
garden
this
is
my
world
and
my
happiness
sometimes
paulo
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
that
the
walls
surrounding
us
might
suddenly
tumble
down
and
all
the
tall
houses
standing
behind
them
and
all
the
curious
people
lounging
in
the
streets
could
then
look
in
upon
my
paradise
that
must
be
terrible
and
yet
marianne
tells
me
that
other
people
live
differently
from
us
that
their
houses
are
not
surrounded
by
walls
and
that
no
watchman
with
dogs
drives
away
troublesome
visitors
from
them
and
yet
she
says
they
smilingly
welcome
such
inconvenient
people
receiving
them
with
friendly
words
while
they
only
thank
god
when
they
finally
go
and
leave
the
occupants
in
peace
is
it
then
true
paulo
that
people
can
be
so
false
to
each
other
and
that
those
who
live
in
the
world
never
dare
to
speak
as
they
think
it
is
alas
but
too
true
natalie
said
paulo
with
a
sad
smile
then
never
let
me
become
acquainted
with
such
a
world
said
the
young
maiden
clinging
to
paulo
s
arm
let
me
always
remain
here
in
our
solitude
which
none
but
good
people
can
share
with
us
for
marianne
is
good
as
also
cecil
your
servant
and
carlo
oh
carlo
would
give
his
life
for
me
he
is
not
false
like
other
people
i
can
confide
in
think
you
so
asked
paulo
looking
deep
into
her
eyes
with
a
scrutinizing
glance
she
bore
his
glances
with
a
cheerful
and
unembarrassed
smile
and
a
roguish
nod
of
her
little
head
you
must
certainly
wish
to
paint
me
again
that
you
look
at
me
so
earnestly
no
paulo
i
will
not
sit
to
you
again
you
paint
me
much
too
handsome
you
make
an
angel
of
me
while
i
am
yet
only
a
poor
little
thing
who
lives
but
by
your
mercy
and
does
not
even
know
her
own
name
angels
never
have
a
name
they
are
only
known
as
angels
and
need
no
further
designation
as
there
is
an
angel
gabriel
so
there
is
an
angel
natalie
mocker
said
she
laughing
there
are
no
feminine
angels
but
now
come
be
seated
here
is
my
guitar
and
i
will
sing
you
a
song
for
which
carlo
yesterday
brought
me
the
and
the
words
asked
paulo
well
as
to
the
words
they
must
come
in
the
singing
one
set
of
words
another
who
can
know
what
glows
in
your
heart
at
any
given
hour
and
what
you
may
feel
in
the
next
and
which
will
escape
you
in
words
unknown
to
yourself
and
which
unconsciously
and
involuntarily
stream
from
your
you
are
my
charming
poetess
my
sappho
exclaimed
paulo
kissing
her
hand
ah
would
that
you
spoke
true
said
she
with
sparkling
eyes
and
a
deeper
flush
upon
her
cheeks
let
me
be
a
poetess
like
sappho
and
i
would
like
her
joyfully
leap
from
the
rocks
into
the
sea
oh
there
are
yet
poetesses
carlo
has
told
me
of
them
all
rome
now
worships
the
great
improvisatrice
corilla
i
should
like
to
know
her
paulo
only
to
adore
her
only
to
see
her
in
her
splendor
and
her
beauty
if
you
wish
it
you
shall
see
her
said
paulo
ah
i
shall
see
her
then
shouted
natalie
and
as
if
to
give
expression
to
her
inward
joy
she
touched
the
strings
of
her
guitar
and
in
clear
tones
resounded
a
jubilant
melody
then
she
began
to
sing
at
first
in
single
isolated
words
and
exclamations
which
constantly
swelled
into
more
powerful
animated
and
blissful
tones
and
finally
flowed
into
a
regular
dithyramb
it
was
a
song
of
jubilee
a
sigh
of
innocence
and
happiness
she
sang
of
god
and
the
stars
of
happy
love
and
of
reuniting
of
blossom
fragrance
and
fanning
zephyrs
and
in
unconscious
foreboding
pain
she
sang
of
the
sorrows
of
love
and
the
pangs
of
renunciation
all
nature
seemed
listening
to
her
charming
song
no
leaflet
stirred
in
low
murmurs
splashed
the
waves
of
the
fountain
by
which
she
sat
and
occasionally
a
nightingale
wailed
in
unison
with
her
hymn
of
rejoicing
the
sun
had
descended
to
a
point
nearer
the
horizon
and
bordered
it
with
moving
purple
clouds
natalie
suddenly
interrupting
her
song
pointed
with
her
rosy
fingers
to
the
heavens
how
beautiful
it
is
paulo
said
she
he
however
saw
nothing
but
her
face
illuminated
by
the
evening
glow
how
beautiful
art
thou
he
whispered
low
pressing
her
head
to
his
bosom
then
both
were
silent
looking
lost
in
sweetest
dreams
upon
the
surrounding
landscape
which
as
if
in
a
silence
of
adoration
seemed
to
listen
for
the
parting
salutation
of
the
god
of
day
a
nightingale
suddenly
came
and
perched
upon
the
under
which
natalie
and
her
friend
were
reposing
soon
she
began
to
sing
now
in
complaining
now
in
exulting
tones
now
tenderly
soft
now
in
joyful
and
the
that
now
arose
rustled
in
among
the
cypress
and
olive
trees
natalie
clung
closer
to
her
friend
s
side
i
would
now
gladly
die
said
she
already
die
whispered
he
die
before
you
have
lived
natalie
then
they
were
again
silent
the
wind
rustled
in
the
trees
the
fountains
murmured
the
birds
sang
and
in
golden
light
lay
the
moon
over
this
paradise
of
two
happy
beings
but
what
is
that
which
is
rustling
in
the
pines
close
to
the
wall
what
is
that
looking
out
with
flashing
eyes
and
a
poisonous
glance
is
it
the
serpent
already
come
to
expel
these
happy
beings
from
their
paradise
they
see
nothing
they
hear
nothing
they
are
both
dreaming
so
sure
do
they
feel
of
their
happiness
but
there
is
a
continued
rustling
it
is
unnatural
it
resembles
not
the
rustling
of
the
evening
wind
it
is
not
the
rustling
of
a
bird
balancing
itself
upon
the
branch
of
the
tree
what
then
is
it
an
opening
is
made
in
the
foliage
and
it
is
the
arm
of
a
man
that
makes
it
upon
the
wall
is
to
be
seen
the
form
of
a
man
and
near
him
slowly
rises
a
second
form
cautiously
he
glances
around
and
then
makes
a
scornful
grimace
while
his
eyes
shine
like
those
of
a
hyena
he
has
discovered
the
two
sitting
together
in
happy
security
and
enjoying
the
tranquil
beauty
of
the
evening
in
silent
beatitude
he
has
seen
them
and
points
toward
them
with
his
finger
while
at
the
same
time
he
lightly
touches
the
arm
of
the
other
man
who
has
boldly
swung
himself
up
on
the
wall
the
glance
of
the
latter
follows
the
direction
in
which
the
other
points
he
also
now
sees
the
reposing
pair
and
over
his
features
also
flits
an
unnatural
smile
he
suddenly
fumbles
in
his
bosom
and
when
his
hand
is
withdrawn
a
small
dagger
glistens
in
it
with
a
bold
leap
the
man
is
already
on
the
point
of
springing
from
the
wall
into
the
garden
the
other
holds
him
back
and
makes
a
threatening
he
it
seems
is
the
commander
and
uses
his
power
with
an
indignant
negative
shake
of
the
head
his
commanding
glance
seems
to
say
be
silent
and
observe
staring
and
immovably
their
eyes
were
now
fixed
upon
the
silent
pair
sitting
in
the
bright
moonlight
which
surrounded
them
as
with
a
glory
one
of
the
men
still
holds
the
dagger
in
his
hand
and
with
a
powerful
arm
the
other
holds
him
in
check
then
they
whisper
low
together
they
seem
to
be
consulting
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
the
man
with
the
dagger
seems
to
yield
to
the
arguments
or
persuasions
of
the
other
he
nods
his
consent
the
first
disappears
behind
the
wall
and
the
armed
one
slowly
follows
him
yet
once
again
he
glances
over
the
wall
raising
his
arm
and
shaking
his
dagger
toward
natalie
and
her
friend
then
he
disappeared
and
all
was
again
peaceful
and
still
in
this
smiling
paradise
was
it
perhaps
only
an
illusive
dream
that
bantered
us
only
a
formed
by
the
moonbeams
or
does
the
serpent
of
evil
really
lurk
about
this
paradise
will
destruction
find
its
way
into
this
charmed
garden
ah
no
solitude
and
no
wall
can
afford
protection
against
misfortune
it
creeps
through
the
strongest
lock
and
over
the
highest
wall
and
while
we
think
ourselves
safe
it
is
already
there
close
to
us
and
nearly
ready
to
swallow
us
up
the
letters
it
was
suddenly
lively
in
the
garden
cecil
paulo
s
old
servant
approached
from
the
house
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
he
comes
down
the
alley
with
hasty
steps
and
with
an
anxious
countenance
approaches
his
master
what
is
it
cecil
two
letters
sir
that
have
just
arrived
one
comes
from
the
hotel
of
the
russian
legation
and
the
other
from
that
of
the
paulo
shuddered
slightly
and
his
hand
involuntarily
grasped
after
the
first
letter
but
he
suddenly
constrained
himself
and
his
glance
fell
upon
natalie
whose
eyes
were
fixed
with
curiosity
upon
the
two
letters
we
will
first
see
what
the
good
cardinal
bernis
writes
us
said
count
paulo
placing
the
russian
letter
in
his
pocket
with
apparent
indifference
bernis
asked
natalie
is
not
that
the
french
cardinal
who
is
at
the
same
time
a
poet
and
whom
the
pope
the
great
ganganelli
so
dearly
loves
the
same
said
paulo
and
besides
the
same
cardinal
bernis
whom
i
had
months
ago
promised
to
allow
the
pleasure
of
making
your
acquaintance
he
already
knows
you
natalie
although
he
has
never
yet
seen
your
fair
face
he
knows
you
from
what
i
have
told
oh
let
us
quickly
see
what
the
good
cardinal
writes
exclaimed
natalie
clapping
her
hands
with
the
impatience
of
a
child
count
paulo
smilingly
broke
the
seal
and
read
the
letter
you
are
in
truth
a
witch
said
he
you
must
have
some
genius
in
your
service
who
listens
to
every
wish
you
express
in
order
to
fulfil
it
without
delay
this
letter
contains
an
invitation
from
the
cardinal
he
gives
a
great
entertainment
and
begs
of
me
that
i
will
bring
you
to
it
the
improvisatrice
corilla
will
also
be
there
oh
then
i
shall
see
her
exclaimed
the
delighted
young
maiden
at
length
i
shall
see
a
poetess
for
we
shall
go
to
this
entertainment
shall
we
not
paulo
the
count
thoughtfully
cast
down
his
eyes
and
his
hand
involuntarily
sought
the
letter
in
his
pocket
an
expression
of
deep
care
and
anxiety
was
visible
on
his
features
and
cecil
seemed
to
divine
the
thoughts
of
his
master
for
he
also
looked
anxious
and
a
deep
sigh
escaped
from
his
natalie
perceived
nothing
of
all
this
she
was
wholly
occupied
by
the
thought
of
seeing
corilla
the
great
improvisatrice
of
whom
carlo
natalie
s
had
told
her
so
much
and
whose
fame
was
sounded
by
children
and
adults
in
all
the
streets
of
rome
we
go
to
this
festival
do
we
not
paulo
repeated
she
as
the
count
still
continued
silent
recovering
from
his
abstraction
he
said
yes
we
will
go
it
is
time
that
my
natalie
was
introduced
into
this
circle
of
influential
romans
that
she
may
gain
friends
among
people
of
importance
who
may
watch
over
and
protect
her
when
i
no
longer
can
you
will
then
leave
me
cried
the
young
maiden
turning
pale
and
anxiously
grasping
the
count
s
arm
no
paulo
you
can
not
do
that
would
you
leave
me
because
i
a
foolish
child
desired
to
go
to
this
festival
and
was
no
longer
contented
with
our
dear
and
beautiful
solitude
that
was
wrong
in
me
paulo
as
i
now
plainly
see
and
i
desire
it
no
longer
oh
we
will
prepare
other
pleasures
for
ourselves
here
in
our
delightful
paradise
you
have
often
called
me
a
poetess
and
i
will
now
believe
i
am
and
no
longer
wish
to
see
another
i
will
suffice
for
myself
come
i
will
immediately
sing
you
a
song
a
festival
song
my
friend
and
taking
her
guitar
natalie
struck
some
joyous
accords
but
count
paulo
lightly
laid
his
hands
upon
the
strings
so
as
to
silence
them
and
drawing
the
tips
of
her
fingers
to
his
lips
with
a
slight
shaking
of
his
head
he
said
not
now
my
charming
poetess
i
am
not
worthy
of
hearing
and
it
is
late
added
cecil
coming
as
it
were
to
the
aid
of
his
master
the
count
rose
yes
you
are
right
it
is
late
said
he
and
i
must
not
longer
keep
natalie
from
her
slumber
come
my
sweet
child
you
must
retire
you
must
sleep
that
your
brow
may
beam
with
blooming
freshness
natalie
made
no
answer
with
a
light
sigh
she
mechanically
took
the
count
s
offered
arm
cecil
preceded
them
with
the
lantern
in
his
hand
thus
they
proceeded
up
the
alley
leading
to
the
villa
all
three
silent
and
thoughtful
the
sky
had
become
obscured
a
black
cloud
intercepted
the
light
of
the
moon
and
natalie
s
charmed
garden
was
suddenly
wrapped
in
gloom
a
cold
shudder
ran
through
her
delicate
frame
a
feeling
of
anxiety
has
come
over
me
she
whispered
clinging
close
to
the
count
s
side
poor
child
said
the
count
are
you
already
oppressed
with
fear
what
if
the
wall
should
give
way
and
bad
people
should
intrude
into
our
garden
ah
marianne
says
that
misfortune
lurks
everywhere
in
the
world
lying
in
ambush
for
those
who
think
themselves
safe
destroying
their
happiness
and
making
them
wholly
miserable
and
people
only
laugh
and
rejoice
that
another
man
s
hopes
have
been
wrecked
ah
and
i
have
felt
so
secure
in
my
happiness
if
misfortune
should
now
actually
come
if
these
walls
should
prove
not
high
enough
to
keep
it
off
ah
paulo
protect
me
from
lurking
misfortune
they
had
now
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
villa
paulo
pressed
the
trembling
young
maiden
with
paternal
tenderness
to
his
breast
and
lightly
touching
her
forehead
with
his
lips
he
said
my
love
sleep
gently
and
be
not
anxious
so
long
as
i
live
misfortune
shall
never
approach
you
rest
assured
of
that
thus
speaking
he
led
her
into
the
house
where
marianne
was
waiting
to
accompany
her
to
her
chamber
natalie
silently
followed
her
but
before
entering
her
room
she
once
more
turned
and
pressing
her
fingers
to
her
lips
wafted
kisses
in
the
air
toward
her
friend
paulo
natalie
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
the
smile
instantly
vanished
from
paulo
s
lips
with
impetuous
haste
beckoning
cecil
to
follow
him
he
strode
through
the
corridor
leading
to
his
own
apartments
when
he
had
arrived
there
and
cecil
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
count
with
a
deep
sigh
threw
himself
upon
a
chair
whilst
cecil
silently
busied
himself
in
lighting
the
and
placing
them
upon
the
table
beside
his
master
will
not
your
grace
now
read
the
other
letter
he
timidly
asked
as
count
paulo
still
remained
buried
in
his
silent
reflections
oh
this
unblessed
letter
exclaimed
the
count
with
a
shudder
i
tell
you
cecil
i
feel
that
it
contains
misfortune
it
has
lain
with
a
heavy
weight
like
a
nightmare
upon
my
breast
and
i
yet
felt
not
the
strength
in
me
to
draw
it
forth
and
read
it
in
natalie
s
presence
that
was
well
said
cecil
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
told
you
in
advance
that
the
letter
was
from
russia
that
you
might
be
on
your
guard
but
now
sir
count
we
are
alone
and
now
you
can
read
it
yes
away
with
this
childish
fear
cried
the
count
with
resolution
i
will
be
a
man
cecil
and
whatever
this
letter
may
contain
i
will
bear
it
like
a
man
drawing
forth
the
letter
he
broke
the
seal
with
a
trembling
hand
and
threw
the
cover
across
the
room
then
unfolding
the
letter
he
read
behind
him
stood
cecil
involuntarily
trembling
with
anxious
expectation
the
letter
fell
from
the
count
s
hands
and
a
deadly
paleness
spread
over
his
face
which
bore
the
expression
of
utter
despair
oh
my
prophetic
soul
he
sighed
your
presentiment
is
then
fulfilled
anxiously
asked
cecil
yes
it
is
fulfilled
my
property
is
sequestrated
they
refuse
to
send
me
the
money
i
required
they
command
my
immediate
return
to
russia
as
my
has
expired
and
my
respite
is
at
an
end
and
you
are
lost
my
lord
if
you
do
not
obey
this
command
said
cecil
and
natalie
reproachfully
asked
the
count
can
i
dare
i
leave
her
she
is
much
safer
without
than
with
you
they
may
not
yet
suspect
who
she
is
it
is
very
possible
that
it
in
reality
only
is
because
your
leave
of
absence
has
expired
as
the
laws
of
russia
require
that
every
absentee
should
return
to
his
country
once
in
every
four
years
fulfil
therefore
this
hard
duty
pretend
to
suppose
that
your
recall
is
for
no
other
reason
than
the
renewal
of
your
passport
and
the
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
pay
your
homage
to
the
empress
appear
innocent
and
unconcerned
and
all
may
yet
go
well
no
gloomily
replied
the
count
nothing
will
go
well
any
more
the
whole
future
stands
before
me
in
clear
and
distinct
traits
a
future
full
of
shame
and
horror
oh
would
it
not
be
better
to
flee
from
that
future
and
seek
in
some
remote
and
hidden
valley
a
place
where
perhaps
misfortune
can
not
reach
nor
destruction
overtake
us
how
reproachfully
asked
cecil
is
it
count
paulo
who
speaks
thus
is
it
the
pupil
whom
i
taught
to
defy
misfortune
and
rise
superior
to
disaster
with
courageous
is
it
the
son
of
my
heart
for
whom
i
have
left
all
sacrificed
all
for
whom
i
have
offered
up
my
fatherland
my
freedom
and
my
independence
whom
i
shall
love
until
my
last
breath
paulo
pluck
up
a
good
heart
my
son
you
have
proposed
to
yourself
a
great
end
which
was
only
to
be
reached
by
thorny
and
dangerous
paths
will
you
now
stop
at
the
first
and
return
upon
your
steps
instead
of
pressing
forward
sword
in
hand
no
no
i
know
you
better
my
son
this
momentary
hesitation
will
pass
away
and
you
will
again
be
great
and
strong
for
the
struggle
and
the
victory
with
a
faint
smile
count
paulo
gave
him
his
hand
you
know
not
my
friend
how
great
is
the
sacrifice
you
demand
of
me
said
he
in
a
subdued
tone
i
must
leave
natalie
i
must
never
see
her
more
never
more
draw
consolation
from
her
glance
nor
hope
from
her
charming
smile
oh
cecil
you
have
not
idea
of
what
natalie
is
to
me
you
know
not
that
i
i
know
interposed
cecil
solemnly
i
know
that
you
have
sworn
upon
the
holy
book
to
protect
her
with
your
life
from
every
injury
i
know
that
you
have
sworn
never
to
give
rest
to
yourself
until
you
have
reinstated
her
in
her
inherited
rights
and
that
until
then
she
shall
be
sacred
to
you
sacred
as
a
sister
sacred
as
a
daughter
whose
honor
you
will
protect
and
defend
against
every
outrage
against
even
every
sinful
thought
that
have
you
sworn
and
i
know
you
will
hold
your
word
sacred
and
keep
your
oath
count
paulo
dropped
his
head
upon
his
breast
and
sighed
deeply
i
must
therefore
leave
her
said
he
your
own
welfare
demands
but
how
is
she
to
live
during
our
absence
our
money
will
not
suffice
to
the
end
alas
we
had
so
surely
calculated
on
this
remittance
from
my
estates
and
now
it
fails
us
we
will
sell
that
costly
ornament
of
brilliants
which
you
had
destined
as
a
present
for
natalie
on
her
seventeenth
ah
sighed
the
count
you
have
a
means
for
the
removal
of
every
obstacle
i
must
therefore
go
and
i
go
with
you
said
cecil
i
would
if
it
must
be
so
be
able
to
die
for
you
they
will
destroy
all
three
of
us
said
the
count
believe
me
the
knife
is
already
sharpened
for
our
throats
believe
also
cecil
that
i
tremble
not
from
fear
of
death
but
i
fear
for
natalie
ah
i
already
seem
to
see
the
approach
of
her
murderers
to
see
them
seize
her
with
their
bloody
hands
and
i
shall
not
be
there
to
protect
her
while
count
paulo
thus
spoke
with
a
sad
foreboding
soul
those
two
mysterious
men
who
had
so
threateningly
watched
and
listened
to
natalie
and
her
friend
still
remained
under
the
wall
the
one
still
held
the
dagger
in
his
hand
and
was
unquietly
walking
back
and
forth
near
his
companion
who
had
calmly
thrown
himself
upon
the
ground
you
did
wrong
to
hinder
me
beppo
he
angrily
said
it
would
have
been
best
to
have
finished
them
at
once
the
occasion
could
not
have
been
more
favorable
the
solitary
garden
the
nightly
stillness
and
obscurity
ah
one
blow
would
have
done
the
business
well
and
what
if
the
gentleman
who
sat
near
her
had
seized
you
before
the
blow
was
struck
how
then
asked
the
other
you
are
yet
but
a
novice
and
a
bungler
friend
giuseppo
you
yet
lack
discretion
the
tranquil
glance
the
sure
hand
you
always
suffer
yourself
to
become
excited
which
is
unartistic
and
even
dangerous
we
went
out
today
only
to
obtain
information
we
were
only
to
discover
and
observe
the
signora
and
perhaps
to
watch
for
an
opportunity
but
to
fall
upon
her
in
this
garden
would
have
been
the
extreme
of
stupidity
for
we
had
all
the
servants
and
the
hounds
against
us
and
it
is
one
of
the
first
principles
of
our
profession
to
put
others
in
danger
but
never
to
incur
it
wherefore
then
have
we
come
here
cried
giuseppo
with
vehemence
to
see
her
and
know
her
that
we
may
surely
recognize
her
again
when
the
right
hour
comes
and
that
hour
will
come
i
will
answer
for
it
did
not
the
signora
tell
us
that
this
lady
would
probably
attend
the
festival
of
cardinal
bernis
she
said
well
and
we
have
come
here
that
we
might
see
and
know
her
in
advance
she
is
very
beautiful
and
a
truly
respectable
person
giuseppo
i
am
pleased
with
the
idea
of
this
festival
of
the
french
cardinal
i
think
it
will
afford
much
business
in
our
diplomatic
quarrels
in
the
palace
of
the
french
ambassador
at
rome
cardinal
bernis
there
was
an
unusually
busy
movement
from
the
to
the
all
were
in
a
most
lively
motion
in
the
most
passionate
activity
for
this
morning
while
taking
his
chocolate
the
cardinal
had
sent
for
his
and
quite
contrary
to
the
usual
joviality
of
his
manner
had
very
seriously
and
solemnly
said
to
him
signor
brunelli
i
intrust
you
with
a
very
important
and
responsible
duty
that
of
making
as
splendid
as
possible
the
grand
festival
we
are
three
days
hence
to
give
in
honor
of
the
archduke
ferdinand
no
pains
must
be
spared
nothing
must
be
wanting
the
most
luxurious
richness
the
most
tasteful
decoration
the
most
extravagant
splendor
must
be
exhibited
for
this
entertainment
must
excite
the
attention
not
only
of
rome
but
of
all
europe
it
must
become
the
subject
of
conversation
at
all
the
courts
and
above
all
it
must
cause
the
despair
of
all
present
ambassadorial
housekeeping
i
have
very
important
diplomatic
reasons
for
this
all
europe
shall
see
how
devoted
france
is
to
the
empire
of
austria
and
what
a
good
understanding
subsists
between
the
two
courts
therefore
signor
brunelli
strain
your
inventive
head
that
it
may
on
this
occasion
hit
upon
whatever
is
most
distinguished
and
for
this
must
be
an
entertainment
never
before
equalled
that
is
what
i
expect
what
i
demand
of
you
and
if
you
satisfy
my
demands
it
will
give
me
pleasure
to
reward
your
zeal
by
a
present
of
a
hundred
thus
with
solemn
dignity
spoke
the
cardinal
while
sipping
his
chocolate
and
signor
brunelli
had
pledged
himself
by
a
solemn
oath
punctually
to
fulfil
his
master
s
commands
and
to
astonish
rome
with
an
entertainment
such
as
had
never
been
recorded
in
the
annals
of
diplomatic
history
with
a
proud
step
had
brunelli
gone
to
his
own
private
cabinet
where
having
shut
himself
up
he
had
devoted
several
hours
to
serious
meditation
upon
the
deep
plans
presenting
themselves
to
his
mind
but
signor
brunelli
had
in
fact
a
very
experienced
and
inventive
head
and
the
cardinal
acted
wisely
in
confiding
in
his
and
leaving
to
him
the
ordering
of
the
entertainment
he
had
now
with
the
sharp
glance
of
a
military
commander
arranged
his
plan
of
battle
and
felt
perfectly
sure
of
victory
he
therefore
rang
for
a
servant
and
commanded
the
attendance
of
the
chief
cook
in
the
cabinet
of
the
then
with
a
gentlemanlike
listlessness
he
threw
himself
upon
the
divan
and
began
to
sip
his
coffee
with
the
exact
dignified
deportment
that
had
been
displayed
by
his
excellency
the
cardinal
signor
gianettino
said
he
to
the
entering
cook
i
propose
honoring
you
with
a
very
important
and
significant
affair
i
wish
on
the
day
after
to
prepare
an
entertainment
which
in
splendor
and
magnificence
shall
surpass
anything
hitherto
seen
you
know
that
the
of
the
other
diplomatists
have
become
my
irreconcilable
enemies
through
envy
they
can
not
forgive
me
for
having
more
inventive
faculties
and
better
taste
than
any
of
them
we
must
bring
these
to
despair
and
with
a
gnashing
of
teeth
they
shall
acknowledge
that
in
all
things
i
am
their
master
you
however
must
aid
me
in
this
great
work
in
your
hands
signor
gianettino
lies
a
considerable
part
of
my
triumph
and
my
laurels
for
what
does
it
help
me
if
the
arrangements
and
decorations
if
the
whole
establishment
are
excellent
should
there
be
a
failure
in
the
highest
and
most
sublime
part
of
the
entertainment
in
the
food
the
food
my
dear
sir
and
a
table
is
the
gist
of
a
festival
and
should
there
be
the
least
failure
in
that
the
whole
is
profaned
and
desecrated
and
must
be
covered
with
a
take
my
words
to
heart
signor
let
us
have
a
table
covered
with
food
the
mere
odor
of
which
shall
set
our
first
gourmets
in
ecstatic
astonishment
while
its
judicious
arrangement
will
give
pleasure
to
the
poetic
mind
this
is
what
i
expect
of
you
and
if
you
succeed
in
satisfying
my
requirements
i
am
ready
to
reward
your
exertions
with
fifty
bottles
of
our
best
french
signor
gianettino
returned
his
thanks
with
a
pleasant
thoughtful
smile
and
with
a
majestic
step
repaired
to
his
boudoir
where
he
was
seen
for
a
long
time
walking
back
and
forth
in
deep
thought
and
with
a
wrinkled
brow
then
stepping
to
his
he
sketched
the
plan
of
this
inordinately
great
dinner
at
first
slowly
and
thoughtfully
and
then
with
constantly
more
and
more
fire
and
enthusiasm
carried
away
by
the
greatness
of
the
occasion
and
animated
by
the
importance
of
his
mission
and
his
calling
then
throwing
aside
the
pen
and
exhausted
by
so
great
an
effort
he
gently
glided
down
upon
the
divan
at
the
same
time
ringing
for
a
servant
whom
he
directed
to
bring
his
breakfast
and
afterward
to
summon
all
the
cooks
and
scullions
to
his
cabinet
he
then
stretched
himself
with
eminent
grace
upon
the
divan
as
he
had
seen
the
do
with
a
serious
thoughtfulness
he
sipped
the
glass
of
malvoisie
the
servant
had
brought
him
with
sundry
and
rare
and
they
came
the
cooks
and
scullions
they
came
in
their
white
jackets
with
their
white
aprons
and
caps
they
came
in
solemn
silence
fully
impressed
with
the
importance
of
the
moment
signors
said
the
chief
cook
it
is
on
a
beautiful
and
sublime
affair
that
i
have
assembled
you
here
it
concerns
an
increase
of
the
fame
and
triumphs
we
have
so
many
times
gained
over
our
diplomatic
rivals
and
an
increase
of
the
laurels
we
have
won
in
the
sacred
realms
of
our
art
i
propose
to
prepare
a
banquet
for
and
for
that
i
require
your
support
and
aid
gentlemen
for
what
is
the
use
of
ever
so
good
a
plan
of
battle
of
a
if
his
troops
fail
in
courage
and
skill
to
carry
out
the
plan
of
their
general
gentlemen
i
doubt
not
your
courage
or
skill
you
will
contend
for
the
sake
of
the
fame
we
have
acquired
and
hitherto
enjoyed
without
dispute
for
the
sake
of
the
fame
which
the
french
has
enjoyed
for
centuries
and
which
must
be
preserved
until
the
end
of
all
things
you
will
stand
by
me
gentlemen
in
the
praiseworthy
effort
to
acquire
new
glory
for
france
by
showing
these
little
austrian
princes
and
these
gentlemen
diplomatists
what
wonderful
things
the
french
art
of
cookery
can
bring
to
pass
the
plan
is
devised
and
sketched
and
all
that
is
now
required
is
its
execution
if
this
great
work
succeeds
then
gentlemen
you
may
feel
assured
of
my
eternal
gratitude
a
gratitude
which
i
will
prove
to
you
by
leaving
all
the
remains
of
the
dinner
to
your
free
use
and
sole
benefit
here
is
the
plan
hasten
to
the
work
i
have
assigned
to
each
one
the
part
he
is
to
take
in
its
accomplishment
hasten
therefore
i
however
by
way
of
exception
will
myself
go
to
the
market
and
make
the
necessary
purchases
on
such
an
important
occasion
no
one
however
highly
placed
must
decline
labor
and
the
faithful
performance
of
duty
i
go
therefore
and
six
of
the
may
follow
me
with
their
thus
speaking
the
chief
cook
signor
gianettino
took
his
hat
and
cane
to
go
to
the
market
six
armed
with
large
baskets
followed
him
at
a
respectful
distance
at
the
great
vegetable
and
of
rome
there
was
a
very
unusual
and
extraordinary
life
and
movement
there
was
a
crowd
and
tumult
a
roaring
and
screaming
a
shouting
and
laughing
such
as
had
not
been
heard
for
a
long
time
it
was
partly
in
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
whole
diplomatic
corps
had
been
for
some
days
agitated
with
preparations
for
entertainments
in
honor
of
the
archduke
ferdinand
who
had
come
to
rome
to
see
the
wonders
of
the
holy
city
and
who
could
hardly
find
time
and
leisure
for
the
festivities
offered
him
but
for
the
tradesmen
and
dealers
for
the
country
people
in
the
vicinity
of
rome
this
presence
of
the
austrian
prince
was
a
happy
circumstance
for
these
banquets
and
festivals
scattered
money
among
the
people
and
the
dealers
and
honest
country
people
could
fearlessly
raise
their
prices
as
they
were
sure
of
a
sale
for
their
commodities
the
cooks
and
servants
of
the
diplomatists
and
cardinals
were
seen
running
hither
and
thither
in
busy
haste
everywhere
selecting
the
best
everywhere
buying
and
cheapening
but
in
one
place
in
the
market
there
was
an
especial
liveliness
and
activity
among
the
crowd
and
to
that
spot
signor
gianettino
bent
his
steps
he
had
seen
the
cook
of
the
spanish
ambassador
the
duke
of
grimaldi
among
those
collected
there
and
as
this
cook
was
one
of
his
bitterest
enemies
and
opponents
signor
gianettino
resolved
to
watch
him
and
if
possible
to
play
him
a
trick
he
therefore
cautiously
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
made
a
sign
to
his
followers
to
keep
at
a
distance
from
him
it
was
certainly
a
very
important
affair
with
which
the
spanish
cook
don
bempo
was
occupied
as
it
concerned
the
purchase
of
a
fish
that
a
countryman
had
brought
to
the
city
of
such
a
monstrous
size
and
weight
that
the
like
had
never
been
seen
there
it
was
the
most
remarkable
specimen
with
which
the
roman
had
ever
been
honored
but
the
lucky
fisherman
was
fully
aware
of
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
his
fish
and
in
his
arrogant
pride
demanded
twenty
ducats
for
it
that
was
what
troubled
don
bempo
twenty
ducats
for
one
single
fish
and
the
of
the
spanish
ambassador
had
urged
upon
him
the
most
stringent
economy
but
he
had
indeed
at
the
same
time
urged
upon
him
to
provide
everything
as
splendid
as
possible
for
the
banquet
which
the
duke
of
grimaldi
was
to
give
in
honor
of
the
archduke
ferdinand
indeed
he
had
with
an
anxious
sigh
commanded
him
to
outdo
if
possible
the
next
day
s
feast
of
cardinal
bernis
and
to
provide
yet
rarer
and
more
costly
viands
than
the
french
cook
that
was
what
don
bempo
was
now
considering
and
what
made
him
waver
in
his
first
determination
not
to
buy
the
fish
there
was
only
this
one
gigantic
fish
in
the
market
and
if
he
bought
it
signor
gianettino
his
enemy
of
course
could
not
possess
it
the
triumph
of
the
day
would
then
inure
to
the
spanish
embassy
and
don
bempo
would
come
off
conqueror
that
was
indeed
a
very
desirable
object
but
twenty
ducats
was
still
an
enormous
price
and
was
not
at
all
reconcilable
with
the
recommended
economy
at
any
rate
he
dared
not
buy
the
fish
without
first
consulting
the
of
the
duke
you
will
not
then
sell
this
fish
for
twelve
ducats
asked
don
bempo
just
as
gianettino
had
unnoticedly
approached
reflect
man
twelve
ducats
are
a
fortune
it
is
a
princely
payment
the
fisherman
contemptuously
shook
his
head
rather
than
sell
it
for
twelve
ducats
i
would
eat
it
myself
said
he
and
invite
my
friends
these
good
romans
as
guests
go
go
sublime
spanish
don
and
buy
gudgeons
for
your
pair
of
miserable
ducats
such
a
fish
as
this
is
too
dear
for
you
you
spanish
gentlemen
should
buy
gudgeons
bravo
bravo
cried
the
laughing
spectators
gudgeons
for
the
spanish
gentlemen
with
faces
and
empty
pockets
don
bempo
blushed
with
anger
and
wounded
pride
i
shall
unquestionably
buy
this
fish
said
he
for
nothing
is
too
dear
for
my
master
when
the
honor
of
our
nation
is
to
be
upheld
but
you
must
allow
me
time
to
go
home
and
get
the
money
from
the
keep
the
fish
therefore
so
long
and
i
will
return
with
the
twenty
ducats
for
and
majestically
don
bempo
made
himself
a
path
through
the
crowd
which
laughingly
stepped
aside
for
him
shouting
gudgeons
for
the
spanish
gentleman
don
bempo
who
pays
twenty
ducats
for
a
fish
he
will
certainly
not
come
back
said
the
fisherman
shaking
his
head
he
goes
to
buy
gudgeons
cried
another
what
will
you
bet
that
he
returns
to
buy
the
fish
said
a
third
he
will
not
buy
it
interposed
a
fourth
these
spaniards
have
no
money
they
are
poor
devils
who
dares
say
that
shrieked
another
and
now
suddenly
followed
one
of
those
quarrels
which
are
so
quickly
excited
on
the
least
occasion
among
the
passionate
people
of
the
south
there
was
much
rage
abuse
and
noise
how
flashed
the
eyes
how
shook
the
fists
what
threats
resounded
there
peace
my
dear
friends
be
quiet
i
tell
you
cried
the
fisherman
with
his
stentorian
voice
see
there
comes
a
new
purchaser
for
my
fish
be
quiet
and
let
us
see
how
much
france
is
disposed
to
offer
the
disturbance
subsided
as
suddenly
as
it
had
arisen
and
all
pressed
nearer
all
directed
interrogating
curious
expectant
glances
at
signor
gianettino
who
just
at
that
moment
approached
with
a
proud
and
grave
step
followed
by
the
solemn
train
of
six
scullions
with
their
baskets
no
one
had
before
remarked
him
in
the
crowd
for
they
had
been
all
eyes
and
ears
for
don
bempo
and
hence
every
one
supposed
that
he
had
only
just
then
arrived
the
shrewd
chief
cook
also
assumed
the
appearance
of
having
only
accidentally
passed
that
way
without
the
intention
of
buying
any
thing
but
he
suddenly
stopped
before
the
great
fish
as
if
astonished
at
its
enormous
size
and
seemed
to
view
it
with
admiration
and
delight
what
a
rare
and
splendid
animal
is
this
he
finally
exclaimed
with
animation
really
one
must
come
to
rome
to
see
such
a
wonder
that
is
understood
exultingly
cried
the
bystanders
who
had
a
reverence
for
the
fishes
of
rome
this
is
no
niggard
will
not
be
so
mean
as
to
offer
twelve
ducats
for
such
a
miracle
as
this
twelve
ducats
cried
gianettino
folding
his
hands
how
can
you
think
me
so
pitiful
as
to
offer
such
a
miserable
sum
for
so
noble
a
fish
no
truly
he
must
have
a
bold
forehead
who
would
offer
so
little
money
for
this
splendid
animal
hear
him
hear
cried
the
people
this
is
a
learned
man
he
knows
something
of
the
value
of
rarities
long
life
to
the
french
cook
grande
ministre
della
cucina
gianettino
bowed
politely
in
response
to
the
compliment
and
then
civilly
asked
the
price
of
the
fish
the
fisherman
stood
there
with
an
expression
of
regretful
sadness
upon
his
face
i
fear
it
will
be
of
little
use
to
name
the
price
said
he
the
fish
is
as
good
as
sold
nevertheless
name
the
price
twenty
ducats
twenty
ducats
exclaimed
gianettino
with
an
expression
of
the
liveliest
astonishment
you
jest
my
friend
how
can
such
a
splendid
animal
be
possibly
sold
for
twenty
ducats
here
hear
shouted
the
crowd
he
finds
the
price
too
low
he
is
a
real
gentleman
he
will
not
buy
gudgeons
like
the
spaniard
in
earnest
friend
tell
me
the
price
of
this
fish
said
gianettino
i
have
demanded
twenty
ducats
for
it
sadly
responded
the
fisherman
and
it
is
sold
for
that
impossible
in
that
case
it
would
not
be
lying
here
replied
gianettino
or
had
the
man
paid
you
the
money
and
now
gone
for
a
cart
for
the
conveyance
of
the
giant
i
have
not
yet
been
the
purchaser
then
has
given
you
earnest
money
no
not
even
that
i
have
yet
received
nothing
upon
and
you
can
pretend
that
you
have
sold
this
fish
cried
gianettino
and
that
too
for
the
ridiculously
small
sum
of
twenty
ducats
ah
you
are
a
joker
my
good
man
you
wish
to
excite
in
me
a
desire
for
this
rare
specimen
and
therefore
you
say
it
is
sold
but
how
can
a
fish
that
yet
lies
exposed
for
sale
and
for
which
no
one
had
made
you
a
suitable
offer
be
already
sold
and
gravely
approaching
the
giant
of
the
waters
gianettino
laid
his
hand
upon
his
head
and
solemnly
said
the
fish
is
mine
i
purchase
it
you
demand
twenty
ducats
but
i
shall
give
you
what
you
ought
to
have
and
what
the
creature
is
worth
i
shall
pay
you
ducats
for
him
the
crowd
which
had
maintained
an
anxious
and
breathless
silence
during
this
negotiation
now
broke
out
with
a
loud
and
exulting
shout
that
is
a
real
nobleman
il
ministro
della
cucina
il
grande
gianettino
that
is
no
parsimonious
spaniard
he
is
a
french
cavalier
he
will
buy
no
gudgeons
but
will
have
the
right
roman
gentlemen
said
gianettino
modestly
casting
down
his
eyes
i
do
not
understand
your
praises
and
it
seems
to
me
i
only
deal
like
a
man
of
honor
as
every
one
of
you
would
do
this
honest
man
taxes
his
wares
too
low
i
give
him
what
they
are
worth
that
is
all
if
i
acted
otherwise
i
should
not
long
remain
in
the
service
of
the
lofty
and
generous
cardinal
bernis
justice
and
generosity
that
is
the
first
command
of
his
excellency
the
french
ambassador
praise
and
honor
to
cardinal
bernis
and
while
the
people
were
thus
shouting
gianettino
from
his
purse
paid
down
the
ducats
upon
the
fisherman
s
board
he
then
commanded
his
six
attendant
scullions
to
bear
off
the
fish
it
was
indeed
a
heavy
work
to
place
the
enormous
animal
upon
their
baskets
but
the
active
romans
cheerfully
lent
a
hand
and
when
they
had
succeeded
in
the
difficult
task
and
the
six
youngsters
bent
under
their
heavy
load
signor
gianettino
gravely
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
train
and
proudly
gave
the
order
forward
to
the
kitchen
of
his
excellency
cardinal
bernis
at
this
moment
a
man
was
seen
making
his
way
through
the
crowd
thrusting
right
and
left
with
his
elbows
he
incessantly
pushed
on
and
just
as
signor
gianettino
had
fairly
got
his
troop
in
motion
the
man
who
was
no
other
than
don
bempo
succeeded
in
reaching
the
fisherman
s
table
here
i
bring
you
the
twenty
ducats
he
proudly
called
out
they
will
no
longer
say
that
the
spaniards
buy
gudgeons
the
fish
is
mine
there
are
your
twenty
ducats
and
with
a
supercilious
air
don
bempo
threw
the
money
upon
the
table
but
just
as
proudly
did
the
fisherman
push
back
the
money
the
fish
is
sold
said
he
forward
march
repeated
signor
gianettino
his
word
of
command
forward
to
the
kitchen
of
his
excellency
cardinal
bernis
and
with
solemn
dignity
the
train
began
to
move
don
bempo
with
a
cry
of
rage
rushed
upon
the
fish
this
fish
is
mine
he
wildly
cried
i
was
the
first
to
offer
its
price
i
offered
twenty
ducats
and
only
went
home
to
get
the
money
and
i
exclaimed
signor
gianettino
i
offered
ducats
and
immediately
paid
the
cash
as
i
always
have
money
by
it
is
signor
gianettino
the
cook
of
the
french
ambassador
and
i
am
ruined
groaned
don
bempo
staggering
back
yes
it
is
the
cook
of
his
excellency
the
cardinal
cried
the
crowd
and
the
cardinal
is
an
honorable
man
he
is
no
spanish
niggard
he
does
not
haggle
for
a
giant
fish
he
pays
more
than
is
demanded
i
hope
said
signor
gianettino
to
don
bempo
who
still
convulsively
grasped
the
fish
that
you
will
now
take
your
hands
from
my
property
and
leave
me
to
go
my
way
without
further
hindrance
it
is
not
noble
to
lay
hands
on
the
goods
of
another
don
bempo
and
this
fish
is
mine
but
this
is
contrary
to
all
international
law
exclaimed
the
enraged
don
bempo
you
forget
signor
that
you
insult
my
master
that
you
insult
spain
by
withholding
from
me
by
main
force
what
i
have
purchased
in
the
name
of
france
will
never
stand
second
to
spain
proudly
responded
gianettino
and
where
spain
twenty
ducats
france
forward
my
youngsters
to
the
kitchen
of
the
french
ambassador
and
urgently
pushing
back
don
bempo
gianettino
solemnly
marched
through
the
crowd
with
his
retinue
the
people
readily
making
a
path
for
him
and
cheering
him
as
he
went
it
was
a
brilliant
triumph
in
the
person
of
the
chief
cook
of
their
ambassador
which
the
french
celebrated
it
was
a
shameful
defeat
which
spain
suffered
in
the
person
of
her
ambassador
s
chief
cook
proud
and
happy
marched
signor
gianettino
through
the
streets
accompanied
by
his
gigantic
fish
and
followed
by
the
shouts
of
a
roman
mob
humiliated
with
eyes
cast
down
with
rage
in
his
heart
sneaked
don
bempo
toward
the
spanish
ambassador
s
hotel
and
long
heard
behind
him
the
whistling
laughter
and
catcalls
of
the
roman
people
the
fish
feud
cardinal
bernis
was
in
his
boudoir
before
him
lay
the
list
of
those
persons
whom
he
had
invited
to
his
entertainment
of
the
next
day
and
he
saw
with
proud
satisfaction
that
all
had
accepted
his
invitation
i
shall
then
have
a
brilliant
and
stately
society
to
meet
this
austrian
archduke
said
the
cardinal
to
himself
the
of
the
nobility
all
the
cardinals
and
ambassadors
will
make
their
appearance
and
austria
will
be
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
france
maintains
the
best
understanding
with
all
the
european
powers
and
that
she
is
not
the
less
respected
because
the
marquise
de
pompadour
is
in
fact
king
of
ah
this
good
marquise
continued
the
cardinal
stretching
himself
comfortably
upon
his
lounge
and
taking
an
open
letter
from
the
table
this
good
marquise
gives
me
in
fact
some
cause
for
anxiety
she
writes
me
here
that
france
is
in
favor
of
the
project
of
portugal
for
the
suppression
of
the
order
of
the
jesuits
and
i
am
so
to
inform
the
pope
this
is
a
dangerous
thing
marquise
and
may
possibly
burn
your
tender
fingers
the
suppression
of
the
jesuits
is
not
that
to
explode
a
in
the
midst
of
europe
that
may
shatter
all
the
states
no
no
it
is
foolhardiness
and
i
have
not
the
courage
to
apply
the
match
to
this
i
fear
it
may
blow
us
all
into
the
and
the
cardinal
began
to
read
anew
the
letter
of
madame
de
pompadour
which
a
french
courier
had
brought
him
a
few
hours
before
ahem
that
will
be
dangerous
for
the
good
father
said
he
shaking
his
head
austria
also
agrees
to
this
magnificent
plan
of
the
portuguese
minister
pombal
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
austrian
archduke
has
come
to
rome
only
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
to
the
pope
the
consent
of
the
empress
maria
theresa
ha
ha
how
singular
their
chaste
and
virtuous
maria
theresa
and
our
good
pompadour
are
both
agreed
in
the
matter
and
in
taking
this
course
are
both
acting
against
their
own
will
the
women
love
the
jesuits
these
good
fathers
who
furnish
them
with
an
excuse
for
every
weakness
and
hold
a
little
back
door
open
for
every
sin
that
is
very
convenient
for
these
good
women
yes
yes
the
women
i
think
i
know
and
smiling
the
cardinal
sank
deeper
into
himself
dreaming
of
past
of
charming
times
when
he
had
not
yet
counted
years
he
dreamed
of
venice
and
of
a
beautiful
nun
he
had
loved
there
and
who
for
him
had
often
left
her
cloister
in
the
and
warm
and
glowing
with
passion
had
come
to
him
he
dreamed
of
these
heavenly
hours
where
all
pleasure
and
all
happiness
had
been
compressed
into
one
blessed
intoxication
of
bliss
where
the
chaste
priestess
of
the
church
had
for
him
changed
to
a
sparkling
priestess
of
joy
yes
that
was
long
ago
murmured
the
cardinal
as
at
length
he
awoke
from
his
blissful
dreams
of
the
past
those
were
beautiful
times
i
was
then
young
and
happy
i
was
then
a
man
and
now
now
am
old
love
has
withered
and
with
it
poesy
i
am
now
nothing
but
a
there
was
a
low
knock
at
the
door
the
cardinal
hastily
but
carefully
returned
the
portrait
of
his
beautiful
nun
to
the
secret
drawer
in
his
whence
it
had
been
taken
and
bade
the
knocker
to
enter
it
was
brunelli
the
of
the
cardinal
who
came
with
a
proud
step
and
face
beaming
with
joy
to
make
a
report
of
his
plans
and
preparations
for
the
morrow
s
entertainment
in
the
evening
the
park
will
be
illuminated
with
many
thousand
lamps
which
will
outshine
the
sun
so
that
the
guests
will
there
wander
in
a
sea
of
light
said
he
in
closing
his
report
the
cardinal
smiled
and
with
a
stolen
glance
at
the
small
box
that
contained
the
portrait
of
this
beautiful
nun
he
said
spare
some
of
the
walks
in
the
alleys
from
your
sea
of
light
and
leave
them
in
partial
obscurity
a
little
duskiness
is
sometimes
necessary
for
joy
and
happiness
but
how
is
it
with
your
du
what
has
signor
gianettino
to
offer
us
i
hope
he
has
something
very
choice
for
you
know
the
cardinals
like
a
good
table
and
my
friend
duke
grimaldi
has
a
high
opinion
of
our
ah
the
spanish
ambassador
your
excellency
exclaimed
brunelli
contemptuously
the
spanish
ambassador
knows
nothing
of
the
art
of
cookery
or
he
would
not
possibly
be
satisfied
with
his
cook
he
is
a
niggard
a
poor
fellow
of
whom
all
rome
is
speaking
and
laughing
at
him
and
his
master
while
they
are
praising
you
to
the
skies
and
signor
brunelli
related
to
his
listening
master
the
whole
story
of
the
gigantic
fish
and
of
the
humiliation
of
the
spanish
cook
the
cardinal
listened
with
attention
and
a
dark
cloud
gradually
gathered
upon
his
thoughtful
brow
that
is
a
very
unfortunate
occurrence
said
he
shaking
his
head
as
brunelli
ended
but
at
least
it
was
an
occurrence
in
which
france
triumphed
your
excellency
responded
brunelli
i
much
fear
the
duke
of
grimaldi
will
do
as
you
have
done
said
the
cardinal
he
will
confound
my
cook
with
france
and
in
his
cook
see
all
spain
then
your
excellency
is
not
satisfied
asked
brunelli
with
consternation
the
whole
palace
is
full
of
jubilation
all
the
servants
and
lackeys
and
even
the
secretary
of
the
legation
are
delighted
with
this
divine
affair
the
cardinal
paid
no
attention
to
these
panegyrics
of
his
but
thoughtfully
paced
the
room
with
long
strides
and
you
think
gianettino
had
the
right
of
it
at
length
he
asked
he
was
entirely
in
the
right
your
excellency
nothing
had
been
paid
for
the
fish
and
gianettino
s
right
to
purchase
was
perfect
and
nobody
could
dispute
it
well
when
we
are
in
the
right
we
must
maintain
our
right
said
the
cardinal
after
a
pause
and
as
the
affair
is
known
to
all
rome
it
must
be
fought
through
with
the
fish
in
all
its
pride
of
greatness
shall
grace
our
table
we
have
no
dish
of
sufficient
size
in
which
to
serve
then
let
a
new
one
be
made
laughed
the
cardinal
take
the
measure
of
this
goliath
and
hasten
to
the
silversmith
that
he
may
make
a
silver
dish
of
the
proper
size
but
see
that
it
is
completed
by
morning
and
that
it
is
richly
ornamented
if
rome
has
heard
of
the
fish
so
also
must
it
hear
of
the
dish
hasten
therefore
signor
brunelli
and
see
that
all
is
done
as
i
have
ordered
this
is
in
fact
a
very
diverting
story
said
the
cardinal
laughing
when
he
was
again
alone
we
have
here
a
monster
fish
which
will
probably
swallow
my
friendship
with
the
duke
of
grimaldi
well
we
shall
see
the
cardinal
then
rang
for
his
whom
he
ordered
to
dress
him
court
toilet
asked
the
servant
astonished
at
being
called
to
this
service
at
so
unusual
an
hour
no
house
toilet
said
the
cardinal
i
shall
soon
receive
the
shrewd
cardinal
had
not
deceived
himself
in
a
few
minutes
an
equipage
rolled
into
the
court
and
the
footman
announced
his
highness
the
spanish
ambassador
the
duke
of
grimaldi
he
is
a
thousand
times
welcome
cried
the
cardinal
and
as
the
door
now
opened
and
the
spanish
duke
entered
the
cardinal
advanced
to
receive
him
with
open
arms
and
a
friendly
smile
my
dear
friend
what
a
delightful
surprise
is
this
said
the
cardinal
but
the
duke
observed
neither
the
open
arms
nor
the
pleasant
smile
nor
yet
the
friendly
welcome
of
the
cardinal
he
strode
forward
with
a
serious
majestic
and
placing
himself
directly
before
the
cardinal
he
solemnly
asked
know
you
of
the
outrage
which
a
servant
of
your
house
has
inflicted
on
mine
of
an
outrage
asked
the
cardinal
without
embarrassment
i
have
been
told
that
your
cook
had
a
dispute
with
mine
because
mine
had
bought
a
fish
that
was
too
dear
for
yours
that
is
all
i
then
they
have
not
told
you
thundered
the
duke
that
your
servant
like
an
impudent
street
robber
has
wrongfully
seized
my
property
for
that
fish
was
mine
it
belonged
to
the
spanish
embassy
and
therefore
to
spain
and
your
servant
has
with
outrageous
insolence
committed
a
trespass
upon
the
property
of
a
foreign
power
did
this
fish
then
actually
belong
to
the
spanish
crown
asked
bernis
was
it
already
paid
for
and
legally
yours
it
was
not
paid
for
but
was
ordered
and
my
servant
had
gone
home
for
the
as
long
as
it
was
not
paid
for
no
one
could
have
any
claim
upon
you
are
then
disposed
to
dispute
the
fish
with
me
cried
the
duke
should
i
dispute
it
smilingly
responded
the
cardinal
that
would
be
the
equivalent
to
a
recognition
of
your
right
to
it
which
i
have
no
idea
of
making
besides
my
friend
what
does
this
quarrel
of
our
cooks
concern
us
and
what
has
spain
and
france
to
do
with
these
disputes
of
our
servants
they
may
fight
out
their
own
quarrels
with
each
other
let
us
give
them
leave
to
do
so
and
if
they
give
each
other
bloody
heads
very
well
we
will
bind
them
up
that
is
all
you
take
the
affair
with
your
usual
practical
indifference
said
the
duke
with
bitterness
and
i
can
only
regret
being
compelled
to
look
at
it
in
a
different
light
the
question
here
is
not
of
a
difficulty
between
our
servants
but
of
an
insult
which
spain
has
received
from
france
in
the
face
of
all
rome
yes
all
rome
has
witnessed
this
insult
and
these
miserable
romans
have
even
dared
to
dishonor
us
with
irony
and
satire
and
to
mock
and
deride
spain
while
they
overload
you
with
their
praises
the
good
romans
as
you
know
are
like
children
this
contest
of
our
cooks
has
delighted
them
and
they
shouted
a
to
the
conqueror
but
i
beg
you
not
to
forget
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
victories
of
my
but
i
have
something
to
do
with
the
defeats
of
mine
whoever
insults
my
servants
insults
me
and
whoever
insults
me
insults
the
kingdom
i
represent
insults
spain
it
is
therefore
in
the
name
of
spain
that
i
demand
satisfaction
spain
has
a
right
to
this
fish
i
demand
my
right
i
demand
the
surrender
of
the
fish
if
you
take
this
matter
in
earnest
said
the
cardinal
then
am
i
sorry
to
be
compelled
also
to
be
serious
if
spain
can
find
offence
in
the
fact
that
france
has
bought
a
fish
which
is
too
dear
for
the
spanish
cook
i
can
not
see
how
i
can
here
make
satisfaction
as
we
can
not
be
taxed
with
any
you
refuse
me
the
fish
then
exclaimed
the
duke
bursting
with
rage
as
you
say
that
all
rome
knows
of
this
affair
and
takes
an
interest
in
it
i
can
not
act
otherwise
it
must
not
have
the
appearance
that
france
feels
herself
less
great
and
powerful
than
spain
that
france
pusillanimously
yields
when
spain
makes
an
unjust
demand
that
is
to
say
you
wish
to
break
off
all
friendly
relations
with
us
and
can
those
relations
be
seriously
endangered
by
this
affair
asked
the
cardinal
with
vivacity
is
it
possible
that
this
trifling
misunderstanding
between
two
servants
can
exercise
an
influence
upon
a
friendship
and
harmony
of
two
powers
whose
relations
whether
friendly
or
otherwise
may
uphold
or
destroy
the
peace
of
europe
honor
is
the
first
law
of
the
spaniard
proudly
responded
the
duke
and
whoever
wounds
that
can
no
longer
be
my
friend
france
has
attached
the
honor
of
spain
and
all
rome
has
chimed
in
with
the
insulting
acclamations
of
france
all
rome
knows
the
story
of
this
fish
then
let
us
show
these
silly
romans
that
we
both
look
upon
the
whole
affair
merely
as
a
jest
when
you
laughingly
eat
of
this
fish
the
good
romans
will
feel
ashamed
of
themselves
and
their
childish
you
propose
then
when
the
nobility
of
rome
when
all
the
diplomatists
are
assembled
to
parade
before
them
this
fish
which
sets
all
tongues
in
motion
asked
the
duke
turning
pale
the
fish
was
bought
for
this
dinner
and
must
be
eaten
said
the
cardinal
laughing
then
i
regret
that
i
can
not
be
present
at
this
festival
cried
the
duke
rising
you
can
not
desire
that
i
should
be
a
witness
to
my
own
shame
and
your
triumph
you
are
no
roman
emperor
and
i
am
no
conquered
hero
compelled
to
appear
in
your
triumphal
train
i
recall
my
consent
and
shall
not
appear
at
your
s
festival
reflect
and
consider
this
well
said
the
cardinal
almost
sadly
if
you
fail
to
appear
when
the
whole
diplomacy
are
assembled
at
my
house
for
an
official
dinner
that
will
signify
not
only
that
the
duke
breaks
with
his
old
friend
the
cardinal
but
also
that
spain
wishes
to
dissolve
her
friendly
relations
with
let
it
be
so
considered
said
the
duke
better
an
open
war
than
a
clandestine
defeat
adieu
sir
cardinal
and
the
duke
made
for
the
door
but
the
cardinal
held
him
back
have
you
reflected
upon
the
consequences
he
asked
you
know
what
important
negotiations
at
this
moment
occupy
the
catholic
courts
of
the
abolition
of
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
of
orders
of
the
extirpation
of
the
jesuits
is
the
question
the
pope
is
favorable
to
this
idea
of
the
portuguese
minister
pombal
but
he
desires
the
of
the
other
catholic
courts
austria
gives
her
consent
as
do
sardinia
and
all
the
other
italian
states
only
the
court
of
spain
has
declared
itself
the
friend
and
defender
of
the
jesuits
and
for
your
sake
has
france
hitherto
remained
passive
on
this
most
important
question
and
has
affected
not
to
hear
the
demands
of
her
subjects
for
your
sake
has
france
stifled
her
own
convictions
and
joined
in
your
support
therefore
think
well
of
what
you
are
about
to
do
to
break
off
your
friendly
relations
with
france
is
to
compel
france
to
take
sides
against
spain
and
if
the
powerful
voice
of
france
is
heard
against
the
jesuits
the
single
voice
of
spain
will
be
powerless
to
uphold
well
then
let
them
go
cried
the
duke
what
care
i
for
the
jesuits
when
the
defence
of
our
honor
is
concerned
sir
cardinal
farewell
however
france
may
decide
spain
will
never
submit
to
her
arrogance
the
duke
abruptly
left
the
room
slamming
the
door
after
him
cardinal
bernis
saw
his
departure
with
an
expression
of
sadness
and
such
are
the
friendships
of
man
he
murmured
to
himself
the
slightest
offence
is
sufficient
to
destroy
a
friendship
of
many
years
well
we
must
reconcile
ourselves
to
it
he
continued
after
a
pause
and
at
all
events
it
has
its
very
diverting
side
for
many
months
i
have
taken
pains
to
support
grimaldi
with
the
pope
in
his
defence
of
the
jesuits
and
now
that
celebrated
order
will
be
abolished
because
a
french
cook
has
bought
a
fish
that
was
too
dear
for
the
spanish
cook
by
what
small
influences
are
the
destinies
of
mankind
decided
but
now
i
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
continued
the
cardinal
rousing
himself
from
his
troubled
thoughts
grimaldi
has
rendered
it
impossible
for
me
longer
to
oppose
the
views
of
the
marquise
de
pompadour
i
must
now
give
effect
to
the
commands
of
my
feminine
sovereign
and
announce
to
the
pope
the
assent
of
france
to
his
policy
to
the
pope
then
the
letter
of
the
marquise
may
make
known
the
will
of
the
cardinal
hastily
donned
his
official
costume
and
ordered
his
carriage
for
a
visit
to
the
vatican
pope
ganganelli
clement
xiv
two
men
were
walking
up
and
down
in
the
garden
of
the
quirinal
engaged
in
a
lively
discourse
one
of
them
was
an
old
man
of
more
than
sixty
years
long
white
locks
waved
about
his
forehead
falling
like
a
halo
on
both
sides
of
his
cheeks
an
infinite
mildness
and
clearness
looked
out
from
his
dreamy
eyes
and
a
smile
of
infinite
kindness
played
about
his
mouth
but
so
full
of
sorrow
and
resignation
that
it
filled
one
s
heart
with
sadness
and
his
eyes
with
tears
his
tall
herculean
form
was
bent
and
shrunken
age
had
broken
it
but
could
not
take
away
that
noble
and
dignified
expression
which
distinguished
that
old
man
and
involuntarily
impelled
every
one
to
reverence
and
a
sort
of
adoration
to
his
friends
and
admirers
this
old
man
seemed
a
being
and
often
in
their
enthusiasm
they
called
him
their
saviour
the
son
of
god
the
old
man
would
smile
at
this
and
say
you
are
right
in
one
respect
i
am
indeed
a
son
of
god
as
you
all
are
but
when
you
compare
me
with
our
saviour
it
can
only
be
to
the
crucified
i
am
indeed
a
crucified
person
like
him
and
have
suffered
many
torments
but
i
have
also
overcome
and
when
so
speaking
there
lay
in
his
face
an
almost
celestial
clearness
and
joyfulness
which
would
impel
one
involuntarily
to
bow
down
before
him
had
he
not
been
as
he
was
the
vicegerent
of
god
upon
earth
the
pope
ganganelli
the
man
who
was
now
walking
with
him
formed
a
singular
contrast
with
the
mild
appearance
of
the
pope
he
was
a
man
of
forty
with
a
wild
face
whose
eyes
flashed
with
malice
and
rage
whose
mouth
gave
evidence
of
sensuality
and
barbarity
and
whose
form
was
more
appropriate
for
a
vulcan
than
a
prince
of
the
church
and
yet
he
was
such
as
was
manifested
by
his
dress
by
the
great
cardinal
s
hat
over
his
shoulder
and
by
the
flashing
cross
of
brilliants
upon
his
breast
this
cardinal
was
very
well
known
and
whenever
his
name
was
mentioned
it
was
with
secret
curses
with
a
sign
of
the
cross
and
a
prayer
to
god
for
aid
in
avoiding
him
the
terror
of
rome
the
cardinal
albani
sighing
and
reluctantly
had
the
pope
finally
resolved
to
have
the
cardinal
near
his
person
that
he
might
attempt
by
mild
and
gentle
persuasion
to
soften
his
stubborn
disposition
but
the
cardinal
had
replied
to
all
his
gentle
words
only
with
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
the
shoulders
with
low
murmured
words
with
a
darkly
clouded
brow
it
is
in
no
one
s
power
to
change
and
make
a
new
being
of
himself
he
finally
said
in
a
harsh
tone
as
the
pope
continued
his
exhortations
and
representations
you
my
blessed
father
can
not
convert
yourself
into
a
monster
such
as
you
describe
me
and
i
cardinal
albani
can
not
attain
to
the
sublime
godliness
which
we
all
admire
in
your
holiness
every
one
must
walk
in
his
own
path
taking
especial
care
not
to
disturb
others
in
but
that
is
exactly
what
you
do
gently
replied
ganganelli
all
the
streets
of
rome
bear
witness
to
it
did
you
not
yesterday
in
one
of
those
streets
with
force
and
arms
rescue
a
bandit
from
the
hands
of
justice
and
with
your
murderous
dagger
take
the
life
of
the
servant
of
the
law
they
wanted
to
lead
one
of
my
servants
to
death
who
had
done
nothing
more
than
obey
my
commands
vehemently
responded
the
cardinal
i
liberated
him
from
their
hands
as
was
natural
and
if
some
of
the
were
killed
in
the
encounter
that
was
their
fault
why
did
they
not
voluntarily
give
up
their
prisoner
and
then
run
away
and
was
it
really
your
command
that
this
bandit
fulfilled
asked
the
pope
shuddering
you
know
he
killed
a
young
nobleman
the
pride
and
hope
of
his
family
and
was
caught
in
the
act
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
deny
that
young
nobleman
had
mocked
and
made
a
of
me
in
a
public
company
calmly
replied
the
cardinal
hence
it
was
natural
that
he
must
die
revenge
is
the
first
duty
of
man
and
whoever
neglects
to
take
it
is
dishonored
and
such
men
dare
to
call
themselves
christians
exclaimed
ganganelli
with
uplifted
arms
and
such
men
call
themselves
priests
of
the
religion
of
love
i
am
a
priest
of
love
said
albani
but
of
what
love
responded
the
pope
with
an
appearance
of
agitation
the
priest
of
a
wild
beastly
passion
of
a
rough
animal
inclination
you
know
nothing
of
the
soft
and
silent
love
that
ennobles
the
heart
and
strengthens
it
for
holy
resolutions
which
inculcates
virtue
and
decency
and
lifts
up
the
eyes
to
heaven
of
that
love
which
is
full
of
consolation
and
blessed
hope
and
desires
nothing
for
god
save
me
from
such
a
love
said
the
cardinal
crossing
himself
when
i
love
i
desire
much
and
of
virtue
and
perfection
there
is
thank
god
no
repent
amend
francesco
said
the
pope
i
promised
your
uncle
the
very
worthy
cardinal
alessandro
albani
once
more
to
attempt
the
course
of
mildness
and
exhort
you
to
return
to
the
path
of
virtue
ah
could
you
have
seen
the
poor
old
man
with
tears
streaming
from
his
blind
eyes
tears
of
sorrow
for
you
whom
he
called
his
lost
son
my
uncle
did
very
wrong
so
to
weep
said
the
cardinal
blind
as
he
was
he
yet
kept
a
mistress
how
then
can
he
wonder
that
i
who
can
see
kept
several
two
eyes
see
more
than
none
that
is
natural
but
do
you
then
so
wholly
forget
your
solemn
oath
of
chastity
and
virtue
excitedly
exclaimed
the
pope
look
upon
the
cross
that
covers
your
breast
and
fall
upon
your
knees
to
implore
the
pardon
of
this
cross
was
laid
upon
my
breast
when
i
was
yet
a
boy
gloomily
responded
the
cardinal
the
fetters
were
attached
to
me
before
i
had
the
strength
to
rend
them
my
will
was
not
asked
when
this
stone
was
laid
upon
my
breast
now
i
ask
not
about
your
will
when
i
seek
under
this
weight
to
breathe
freely
as
a
man
and
thank
god
this
weight
has
not
crushed
my
heart
my
heart
that
yet
glows
with
youthful
freshness
and
in
which
love
has
found
a
which
your
cross
can
not
fill
up
and
in
this
now
dwells
a
charming
a
wonderful
woman
whom
rome
calls
the
queen
of
song
and
whom
i
call
the
queen
of
beauty
and
love
all
the
world
adjudges
her
the
crown
of
poesy
and
only
you
refuse
it
to
again
this
old
complaint
said
the
pope
with
a
slight
contraction
of
his
brow
you
again
speak
of
her
of
corilla
interposed
the
cardinal
yes
of
corilla
i
speak
of
that
heavenly
woman
whom
all
the
world
admires
to
whose
beautiful
verses
philosophers
and
poets
listen
with
breathless
delight
and
who
well
deserves
that
you
should
reward
her
as
a
queen
by
bestowing
upon
her
the
poetic
crown
i
crown
a
corilla
mockingly
exclaimed
the
pope
shall
a
corilla
desecrate
the
spot
hallowed
by
the
feet
of
tasso
and
petrarch
no
i
say
no
when
art
becomes
the
plaything
of
a
courtesan
then
may
the
sacred
muses
veil
their
heads
and
mourn
in
silence
but
they
must
not
degrade
themselves
by
throwing
away
the
crown
which
the
best
and
noblest
would
give
their
heart
s
blood
to
obtain
this
corilla
may
bribe
you
poor
earthly
fools
with
her
smiles
and
amorous
verses
but
she
will
not
be
able
to
deceive
the
muses
you
refuse
me
then
the
crowning
of
the
renowned
improvisatrice
corilla
asked
the
cardinal
with
painfully
suppressed
rage
i
refuse
it
and
why
then
did
you
send
for
me
exclaimed
the
cardinal
with
vehemence
was
it
merely
to
mock
me
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
warning
you
my
son
mildly
responded
the
pope
for
even
the
greatest
forbearance
must
at
length
come
to
an
end
and
when
i
am
compelled
to
forget
that
you
are
alessandro
albani
s
nephew
i
shall
then
only
have
to
remember
that
you
are
the
criminal
francesco
albani
whom
all
the
world
condemns
and
whom
i
must
judge
repent
and
reform
my
son
while
there
is
yet
time
and
above
all
things
renounce
this
love
which
heaps
new
disgrace
upon
your
family
and
overwhelms
your
relatives
with
sorrow
and
anxiety
renounce
corilla
cried
the
cardinal
i
tell
you
i
love
her
i
adore
her
this
heavenly
beautiful
woman
how
can
you
ask
me
to
renounce
her
nevertheless
i
do
demand
it
said
the
pope
with
solemnity
demand
it
in
the
name
of
your
father
in
the
name
of
god
against
whose
holy
laws
you
have
sinned
you
his
consecrated
but
that
is
an
impossibility
passionately
exclaimed
francesco
one
must
bear
a
heart
of
stone
in
his
bosom
to
require
it
and
that
you
can
do
so
only
proves
that
you
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
love
and
that
i
can
do
so
should
prove
to
you
that
i
have
indeed
known
it
my
son
sadly
responded
the
pope
whoever
has
known
love
knows
that
there
can
be
no
renunciation
and
whoever
has
known
love
can
renounce
exclaimed
the
pope
with
animation
listen
to
me
my
son
and
may
the
sad
story
of
a
short
happiness
and
long
expiation
serve
you
as
a
warning
example
you
think
i
can
not
have
known
love
ah
i
tell
you
i
have
experienced
all
its
joys
and
all
its
sorrows
that
in
the
intoxication
of
rapture
i
once
forgot
my
vows
my
duties
my
holy
resolutions
and
doubly
criminal
i
also
taught
her
whom
i
loved
to
forget
her
own
sacred
duties
and
to
sin
ah
you
call
me
a
saint
and
yet
i
have
been
the
most
abject
of
sinners
under
this
franciscan
vesture
beat
a
tempestuous
fiery
heart
that
derided
god
and
his
laws
a
heart
that
would
have
given
my
soul
to
the
evil
one
had
he
promised
to
give
me
in
exchange
the
possession
of
my
beloved
she
was
beautiful
and
of
a
heavenly
disposition
and
hence
when
she
passed
through
the
aisles
of
the
church
with
her
slight
fairy
form
her
angelic
face
veiled
by
her
long
dark
locks
her
eyes
beaming
with
love
and
pleasure
a
heavenly
smile
playing
about
her
lips
ah
when
she
thus
passed
through
the
church
her
feet
scarcely
touching
the
floor
then
i
who
awaited
her
in
the
confessional
felt
myself
nearly
frantic
with
ecstasy
my
brain
turned
my
eyes
darkened
there
was
a
buzzing
in
my
ears
and
i
attempted
to
implore
the
aid
and
support
of
you
should
have
appealed
to
cupid
said
the
cardinal
laughing
in
such
a
case
aid
could
come
only
from
the
god
of
ancient
rome
not
of
the
modern
the
old
man
noticed
not
his
words
wholly
absorbed
in
his
reminiscences
he
listened
only
to
the
voice
of
his
own
breast
saw
only
the
form
of
the
beautiful
woman
he
had
once
so
dearly
loved
god
listened
not
to
my
fervent
prayers
he
continued
with
a
sigh
or
perhaps
my
stormily
beating
heart
heard
not
the
voice
of
god
because
i
listened
only
to
her
because
with
intoxicated
senses
i
was
listening
to
the
modest
childishly
pure
confession
which
she
kneeling
in
the
confessional
was
whispering
in
my
ears
because
i
felt
her
breath
upon
my
cheeks
and
in
every
trembling
nerve
of
my
being
and
one
day
overcome
by
his
glowing
passion
the
monk
so
far
forgot
his
sworn
duty
as
to
confess
his
immodest
and
insane
love
for
the
wife
of
another
man
ah
she
was
then
married
remarked
the
cardinal
yes
she
was
married
sold
by
her
own
parents
sacrificed
at
the
shrine
of
mammon
married
to
a
man
whom
she
did
not
and
could
not
love
and
who
pursued
her
with
an
insane
jealousy
ah
she
suffered
and
suffered
with
the
uncomplaining
calmness
of
an
angel
and
i
did
i
not
also
suffer
we
wept
together
we
complained
together
until
our
hearts
at
length
forgot
complaining
and
an
unspeakable
a
terrible
happiness
made
us
forget
our
troubles
i
had
forgotten
all
my
god
my
clerical
vows
she
also
had
forgotten
all
her
husband
her
vow
of
fidelity
and
if
a
thought
of
these
things
sometimes
intruded
upon
our
moments
of
happiness
it
only
caused
us
to
plunge
into
new
delights
and
to
lull
ourselves
anew
into
a
blessed
forgetfulness
and
the
good
jealous
husband
remarked
nothing
asked
the
cardinal
he
remarked
nothing
he
loved
me
he
confided
in
me
he
called
me
his
friend
and
when
he
was
compelled
to
take
a
long
journey
he
confided
to
me
his
house
and
his
wife
establishing
me
as
the
guard
of
her
virtue
the
cardinal
broke
out
into
loud
laughter
these
good
husbands
said
he
they
are
all
alike
to
a
hair
every
one
has
a
friend
in
whom
he
confides
and
it
is
that
very
friend
who
betrays
him
they
must
all
fulfil
their
destinies
these
good
husbands
relate
further
holy
father
your
story
is
very
entertaining
i
am
curious
to
hear
the
end
the
end
was
terrible
replete
with
horror
and
shame
said
the
pope
we
lived
blessed
days
heavenly
nights
oh
we
were
so
happy
that
we
hardly
had
a
thought
for
our
criminality
but
only
for
our
love
one
night
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
closed
door
of
the
house
and
we
shudderingly
recognized
the
voice
of
the
husband
demanding
and
you
were
not
at
all
in
a
situation
to
grant
it
to
him
laughingly
interposed
the
cardinal
he
might
perhaps
have
been
not
a
little
astonished
this
good
husband
that
you
watched
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
the
temple
of
his
wedded
with
tears
of
anguish
and
terror
she
conjured
me
to
fly
to
save
her
from
the
derision
of
the
world
and
the
anger
of
her
husband
she
led
me
to
a
secret
stairway
and
i
like
a
madman
pursued
by
the
furies
was
hastening
to
descend
when
my
foot
slipped
and
i
fell
down
the
stairs
with
a
loud
clattering
noise
i
felt
the
blood
oozing
from
my
breast
and
pouring
from
my
mouth
in
a
warm
stream
my
limbs
pained
me
frightfully
but
i
picked
myself
up
and
with
extremest
suffering
fled
to
my
cloister
when
having
reached
my
cell
i
fell
senseless
a
long
illness
now
confined
me
to
my
bed
and
tortured
my
body
with
frightful
pains
but
far
more
frightful
were
the
tortures
of
my
soul
more
frightful
the
voices
that
day
and
night
whispered
to
me
of
my
crime
and
guiltiness
my
conscience
was
fully
awakened
it
spoke
to
me
in
a
voice
of
thunder
and
like
a
worm
i
turned
upon
my
bed
of
pain
imploring
of
god
a
little
mercy
for
the
torments
that
burned
my
brain
this
time
god
permitted
himself
to
be
found
by
me
i
heard
his
voice
saying
go
and
repent
and
thy
sins
shall
be
forgiven
thee
shake
off
the
sinfulness
that
weighs
upon
thy
head
and
peace
will
return
to
thy
i
heard
this
voice
of
god
and
wept
with
repentant
sorrow
i
vowed
to
obey
and
reconcile
myself
to
god
by
renouncing
my
love
and
never
again
seeing
its
object
it
was
a
great
sacrifice
but
god
demanded
it
and
i
obeyed
that
is
this
sickness
had
restored
you
from
intoxication
to
sobriety
you
were
tired
of
your
mistress
i
had
perhaps
never
loved
her
more
warmly
more
intensely
than
in
those
dreadful
hours
when
i
was
struggling
with
my
poor
tortured
heart
and
imploring
god
for
strength
to
renounce
her
and
separate
myself
from
her
forever
but
god
was
merciful
and
aided
my
weakness
with
his
own
strength
letters
came
from
her
and
i
had
the
cruel
courage
to
read
them
i
had
condemned
myself
to
do
it
as
an
expiation
and
while
i
read
her
soft
complainings
her
i
felt
in
my
heart
the
same
sorrows
the
same
disconsolate
wretchedness
tears
streamed
from
my
eyes
and
i
flayed
my
breast
with
my
nails
in
utter
despair
ah
at
such
moments
how
often
did
i
forget
god
and
my
repentance
how
often
did
i
press
those
letters
to
my
lips
and
call
my
beloved
by
the
tenderest
names
my
whole
soul
my
whole
being
flew
to
her
and
forgetting
all
all
i
wanted
to
rush
to
her
presence
fall
down
at
her
feet
and
be
blessed
only
through
her
even
if
my
eternal
salvation
was
thereby
lost
but
what
was
it
what
then
restrained
my
feet
what
suddenly
arrested
those
words
of
insane
passion
upon
my
lips
and
irresistibly
drew
me
down
upon
my
knees
to
pray
it
was
god
who
then
announced
himself
to
me
god
who
called
me
to
himself
god
who
finally
gave
me
strength
to
understand
my
love
and
always
leave
her
letters
unanswered
until
they
finally
ceased
to
come
until
her
complaints
which
however
had
consoled
me
were
no
longer
heard
the
sacrifice
was
made
god
accepted
it
my
sin
was
expiated
and
i
was
glad
for
my
heart
was
forever
broken
and
never
since
then
has
a
smile
of
happiness
played
upon
my
lips
but
in
my
soul
has
it
become
tranquil
and
serene
god
dwells
there
and
within
me
is
a
peace
known
only
to
those
who
have
struggled
and
overcome
who
have
expiated
their
sins
with
a
free
will
and
flayed
and
your
beloved
what
became
of
her
asked
the
cardinal
did
she
pardon
your
treason
and
console
herself
in
the
arms
of
another
in
the
arms
of
death
said
ganganelli
with
a
low
voice
my
silence
and
my
apparent
forgetfulness
of
her
broke
her
heart
she
died
of
grief
but
she
died
like
a
saint
and
her
last
words
were
may
god
forgive
him
as
i
do
i
curse
him
not
but
bless
him
rather
for
through
him
am
i
released
from
the
burden
of
this
life
and
all
sorrow
is
overcome
she
therefore
died
in
the
belief
of
my
unfaithfulness
she
did
indeed
pardon
me
but
yet
she
believed
me
a
faithless
betrayer
and
the
consciousness
of
this
was
to
me
a
new
torment
and
a
penance
which
i
shall
suffer
forever
and
ever
this
is
the
story
of
my
love
continued
ganganelli
after
a
short
silence
i
have
truly
related
it
to
you
as
it
is
may
you
my
son
learn
from
it
that
when
we
wish
to
do
right
we
can
always
succeed
in
spite
of
our
own
hearts
and
sinful
natures
and
that
with
god
s
help
we
can
overcome
all
and
suffer
all
you
see
that
i
have
loved
and
nevertheless
had
strength
to
renounce
but
it
was
god
who
gave
me
this
strength
god
alone
turn
you
also
to
god
pray
to
him
to
destroy
in
you
your
sinful
love
and
if
you
implore
him
with
the
right
words
and
with
the
right
fervor
then
will
god
be
near
you
with
his
strength
and
in
the
pains
of
renunciation
will
he
purify
your
soul
preparing
it
for
virtue
and
all
that
is
good
and
do
you
call
that
virtue
asked
the
cardinal
may
heaven
preserve
me
from
so
cruel
a
virtue
do
you
call
it
serving
god
when
this
virtue
makes
you
the
murderer
of
your
beloved
and
more
savage
than
a
wild
beast
deaf
to
the
amorous
complaints
of
a
woman
whom
you
had
led
into
love
and
sin
whose
virtue
you
sacrificed
to
your
lust
and
whom
you
afterward
deserted
because
as
you
say
god
called
to
yourself
but
really
only
because
satiated
you
no
longer
desired
her
your
faithfulness
cunningly
clothes
itself
in
the
mantle
of
godliness
nothing
further
no
no
holy
father
of
christendom
i
envy
you
not
this
virtue
which
has
made
you
the
murderer
of
god
s
noblest
work
that
is
a
sacrilege
committed
in
the
holy
temple
of
nature
go
your
way
and
think
yourself
great
in
your
bloodthirsty
murderous
virtue
you
will
not
convert
me
to
it
let
me
still
remain
a
sinner
it
at
least
will
not
lead
me
to
murder
the
woman
i
love
and
provide
for
her
torment
and
suffering
instead
of
the
promised
pleasure
believe
me
corilla
has
never
yet
cursed
me
nor
have
her
fine
eyes
ever
shed
a
tear
of
sorrow
on
my
account
you
have
made
your
beloved
an
unwilling
saint
and
martyr
possibly
that
may
have
been
very
sublime
and
the
angels
may
have
wept
or
rejoiced
over
it
i
have
lavished
upon
my
beloved
ones
nothing
but
earthly
happiness
i
have
not
made
them
saints
but
only
happy
children
of
this
world
and
even
when
they
have
ceased
to
love
me
they
have
always
continued
to
call
me
their
friend
and
blessed
me
for
making
them
rich
and
happy
you
have
set
of
crown
of
thorns
upon
the
head
of
your
beloved
i
would
bind
a
upon
the
beautiful
brow
of
my
corilla
which
will
not
wound
her
head
and
will
not
cause
her
to
die
of
grief
you
are
not
willing
to
aid
me
in
this
my
work
you
refuse
me
this
because
you
have
only
to
dispose
of
very
well
holy
father
of
christendom
i
will
nevertheless
compel
you
to
comply
with
my
wishes
and
you
shall
have
no
peace
in
your
holy
city
from
my
mad
tricks
until
you
promise
me
to
crown
the
great
improvisatrice
in
the
capitol
until
then
holy
father
of
christendom
you
will
not
see
me
again
in
the
vatican
or
quirinal
but
all
rome
shall
ring
with
news
of
me
with
a
slight
salutation
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
from
the
pope
the
cardinal
departed
with
hasty
steps
and
soon
his
herculean
form
disappeared
in
the
shadow
of
the
pine
and
olive
trees
but
his
loud
and
scornful
laugh
long
resounded
in
the
distance
the
pope
s
recreation
hour
the
pope
followed
his
retreating
form
with
a
glance
of
sadness
and
a
shake
of
the
head
he
is
past
help
murmured
he
he
runs
to
his
ruin
and
the
voice
of
warning
is
unheeded
but
how
if
he
should
happen
to
be
right
how
if
he
with
his
worldly
wisdom
and
his
theory
of
earthly
happiness
should
be
more
conformable
to
the
will
of
god
than
we
with
our
virtue
and
our
doctrine
of
renunciation
ah
yes
the
world
is
so
beautiful
it
seems
made
entirely
for
pleasure
and
enjoyment
and
yet
men
wander
through
it
with
tearful
eyes
disregarding
its
beauty
and
refusing
to
share
its
pleasures
all
except
man
is
free
on
earth
he
alone
lies
in
constraining
bands
and
his
heart
bleeds
while
all
creation
rejoices
no
no
that
can
not
be
every
individual
does
what
he
can
to
render
mankind
free
and
happy
and
i
also
will
do
my
part
god
has
laid
great
power
in
my
hand
and
i
will
use
it
so
long
as
it
is
thus
speaking
the
pope
left
the
garden
and
hastened
up
to
his
study
signor
galiandro
said
he
to
his
private
secretary
did
you
not
speak
to
me
of
several
petitions
received
in
which
people
begged
for
dispensations
from
monk
and
cloister
vows
signor
galiandro
smilingly
rummaged
among
a
mass
of
papers
that
covered
the
pope
s
in
the
last
four
weeks
some
fifty
such
petitions
have
been
received
since
your
holiness
has
released
several
monks
and
nuns
from
their
vows
all
these
pious
brides
of
christ
and
these
consecrated
priests
seem
to
have
tired
of
their
cloister
life
and
long
to
be
out
in
the
world
whoever
does
not
freely
and
willingly
remain
in
the
house
of
the
lord
we
will
not
retain
them
said
ganganelli
compelled
service
of
the
lord
is
no
service
and
the
prayer
of
the
lips
without
the
concurrence
of
the
heart
is
null
give
me
all
these
petitions
that
i
may
grant
them
the
love
of
the
world
is
awakened
in
these
monks
and
nuns
and
we
will
give
back
to
the
world
what
belongs
to
the
world
with
their
resisting
and
struggling
hearts
they
will
make
but
bad
priests
and
nuns
perhaps
it
will
be
better
for
them
to
become
founders
of
families
and
they
who
honestly
do
their
duty
equally
serve
god
whether
they
are
in
a
cloister
or
in
the
bosoms
of
their
the
pope
seated
himself
at
his
and
after
having
carefully
examined
all
the
petitions
for
dispensations
signed
his
consent
and
smilingly
handed
them
back
to
his
secretary
i
hope
we
have
here
made
some
people
happy
said
he
rising
and
therefore
it
may
perhaps
be
allowed
us
also
to
be
happy
in
our
own
way
for
a
quarter
of
an
he
lightly
touched
the
silver
bell
suspended
over
his
and
at
the
immediately
opened
door
appeared
the
pleasant
and
face
of
brother
lorenzo
the
franciscan
monk
who
performed
the
whole
service
of
the
pope
lorenzo
said
ganganelli
with
a
smile
let
us
go
down
into
the
you
must
show
me
the
young
chickens
of
which
you
told
me
yesterday
and
hear
would
it
be
asking
too
much
to
beg
of
you
to
bring
my
dinner
into
the
garden
i
would
that
you
could
ask
too
much
said
brother
lorenzo
waddling
after
his
master
who
was
descending
the
stairs
leading
to
the
i
really
wish
your
holiness
that
it
were
asking
too
much
for
then
your
dinner
would
be
at
least
a
little
more
desirable
and
heavier
to
transport
was
such
a
thing
ever
heard
of
the
father
of
christianity
keeps
a
table
like
that
of
the
poorest
begging
monk
and
is
satisfied
with
milk
fruit
bread
and
vegetables
while
the
fattest
of
capons
and
ducks
are
crammed
in
vain
for
him
and
his
cellar
is
replete
with
the
most
generous
well
well
scold
not
said
ganganelli
smiling
have
we
not
for
years
felt
ourselves
well
in
the
franciscan
cloister
it
never
once
occurring
to
us
to
wish
ourselves
better
off
why
should
i
now
quit
the
habits
of
years
and
accustom
myself
to
other
usages
when
i
was
yet
a
franciscan
monk
i
always
had
thanks
to
our
simple
manner
of
living
a
very
healthy
stomach
and
would
you
have
me
spoil
it
now
merely
because
i
have
become
pope
it
has
always
remained
the
same
human
body
lorenzo
and
all
the
rest
is
only
falsehood
and
fraud
how
few
years
is
it
since
you
and
i
were
in
the
cloister
and
you
served
the
poor
franciscan
monk
as
a
lay
brother
you
then
called
me
brother
clement
and
they
all
did
the
same
and
now
you
no
longer
call
me
brother
but
holy
father
how
can
your
brother
of
yesterday
be
your
father
of
we
are
here
alone
lorenzo
nobody
sees
or
hears
us
we
would
for
once
cease
to
be
holy
father
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
become
again
brother
ahem
it
was
not
so
bad
there
simpered
lorenzo
it
was
yet
very
pleasant
in
our
dear
cloister
and
i
often
think
brother
that
you
were
far
happier
then
than
now
when
every
one
falls
upon
his
knees
to
kiss
your
slipper
it
must
be
very
dull
to
be
always
holy
always
so
great
and
sublime
and
always
revered
and
adored
therefore
let
us
go
to
our
ducks
and
hens
said
the
pope
the
people
have
made
a
bugbear
of
me
before
which
they
fall
upon
the
earth
but
the
good
animals
who
understand
nothing
of
these
things
they
cackle
and
grunt
and
gabble
at
me
as
if
i
were
nothing
but
a
common
and
by
no
means
the
sainted
father
of
christendom
come
come
to
my
dear
brutes
who
are
so
frank
and
sincere
that
they
cackle
and
gabble
directly
in
my
face
as
soon
as
their
beaks
and
snouts
are
grown
they
are
not
so
humble
and
devoted
so
adoring
and
cringing
as
these
men
who
prostrate
themselves
before
me
with
humble
and
hypocritical
devotion
but
who
secretly
curse
me
and
wish
my
death
that
there
may
be
a
change
in
the
papacy
come
come
to
our
honest
geese
brother
lorenzo
handed
to
the
pope
the
willow
basket
filled
with
corn
and
green
leaves
and
both
with
hasty
steps
and
laughing
faces
betook
themselves
to
the
the
ducks
and
geese
fluttered
to
them
with
a
noisy
gabbling
as
soon
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
and
ganganelli
laughingly
said
it
seems
as
if
i
were
here
in
the
conclave
and
listening
to
the
contention
of
the
cardinals
as
they
quarrel
about
the
choice
of
a
new
pope
lorenzo
i
should
well
like
to
know
who
will
succeed
me
in
the
sacred
chair
and
hold
the
keys
of
peter
that
will
be
a
stormy
conclave
be
quiet
my
dear
ducks
and
geese
indeed
you
are
in
the
right
i
forgot
my
duty
well
well
i
will
give
you
your
food
now
here
it
is
and
the
pope
with
full
hands
strewed
the
corn
among
the
impatiently
gabbling
geese
and
heartily
laughed
at
the
eagerness
with
which
they
threw
themselves
upon
it
and
is
it
not
with
men
as
with
these
dear
animals
said
he
laughing
when
one
satisfies
them
with
food
they
become
silent
mild
and
gentle
princes
should
always
remember
that
and
before
all
things
satiate
their
subjects
with
food
if
they
would
have
a
tranquil
and
unopposed
government
ah
that
reminds
me
of
our
own
poor
lorenzo
many
petitions
have
been
received
much
misery
has
been
described
and
many
complaints
have
been
made
to
me
that
is
because
they
know
you
are
always
giving
and
would
rather
suffer
want
yourself
than
refuse
gifts
to
others
growled
lorenzo
hardly
half
the
month
is
past
and
we
are
already
near
the
end
of
our
means
already
exclaimed
the
pope
with
alarm
and
i
believe
i
yet
need
much
money
there
is
a
father
of
fourteen
children
who
has
fallen
from
a
scaffolding
and
broken
both
legs
we
must
care
for
him
lorenzo
the
children
must
not
want
for
bread
that
is
understood
that
is
christian
duty
said
lorenzo
eagerly
give
me
the
address
i
will
go
to
him
yet
and
how
much
money
shall
i
take
with
me
well
i
thought
timidly
responded
ganganelli
that
five
scudi
would
not
be
too
much
lorenzo
compassionately
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
can
never
learn
the
value
of
money
said
he
i
am
now
to
take
scudi
to
these
is
it
not
enough
joyfully
asked
ganganelli
well
i
thank
god
that
you
are
so
disposed
i
only
feared
you
would
refuse
me
so
much
because
my
treasury
as
you
say
is
already
empty
but
if
we
have
something
left
give
much
much
more
at
least
a
hundred
scudi
lorenzo
that
is
always
the
way
with
you
from
extreme
to
extreme
grumbled
lorenzo
first
too
little
then
too
much
i
shall
take
to
them
twenty
scudi
and
that
will
be
sufficient
give
them
thirty
begged
ganganelli
do
you
hear
thirty
brother
lorenzo
thirty
scudi
is
yet
a
very
small
sum
ah
what
do
you
know
about
money
answered
lorenzo
laughing
these
geese
here
understand
the
matter
better
than
you
brother
well
it
is
for
that
reason
i
have
made
you
my
cashier
laughed
ganganelli
a
prince
will
always
be
well
advised
when
he
chooses
a
sensible
and
servant
for
that
which
he
does
not
understand
himself
to
acknowledge
his
ignorance
on
the
proper
occasion
does
honor
to
a
prince
and
procures
him
more
respect
than
if
he
sought
to
give
himself
the
appearance
of
knowing
and
understanding
everything
come
lorenzo
let
us
go
into
the
garden
you
see
that
these
fowls
care
nothing
for
us
now
as
they
are
satiated
they
despise
our
provender
come
let
us
go
farther
yes
into
the
garden
exclaimed
lorenzo
with
a
mysterious
smile
come
brother
clement
i
have
prepared
a
little
surprise
for
you
there
come
and
see
it
and
the
two
old
men
turned
their
steps
toward
the
garden
follow
me
said
lorenzo
preceding
the
pope
and
leading
him
to
a
more
solitary
and
better
screened
part
of
the
garden
now
stoop
a
little
and
creep
through
here
and
then
we
are
at
the
the
pope
carefully
followed
the
directions
of
his
leader
and
worked
his
way
through
the
obstruction
of
the
until
he
arrived
at
a
small
circular
place
in
the
centre
of
which
shaded
by
tall
was
a
surrounded
by
tendrils
of
ivy
and
before
which
was
a
small
table
of
wood
yet
retaining
its
natural
covering
of
bark
see
this
is
my
surprise
said
lorenzo
ganganelli
stood
silent
and
motionless
with
folded
hands
a
deep
emotion
was
visible
in
his
gentle
mien
and
tears
rolled
slowly
down
over
his
cheeks
well
is
it
not
well
copied
and
true
to
nature
asked
lorenzo
whose
eyes
beamed
with
satisfaction
my
favorite
spot
in
the
garden
of
the
franciscan
convent
said
ganganelli
in
a
tone
trembling
with
emotion
yes
yes
lorenzo
you
have
represented
it
exactly
you
know
well
enough
what
gives
me
pleasure
accept
my
thanks
my
dear
good
and
while
giving
his
hand
to
the
monk
his
eye
wandered
with
gentle
delight
over
the
place
with
its
beautiful
trees
and
green
reposing
bank
and
thoughtfully
rested
upon
each
individual
object
so
was
it
he
murmured
low
precisely
so
yes
yes
in
this
place
have
i
passed
my
fairest
and
most
precious
hours
what
have
i
not
thought
and
dreamed
as
a
youth
and
as
a
man
how
many
wishes
how
many
hopes
have
there
thrilled
my
bosom
and
how
few
of
them
have
been
realized
but
one
thing
has
been
realized
said
lorenzo
greater
than
all
you
could
have
dreamed
or
hoped
who
would
ever
have
thought
it
possible
that
the
poor
unknown
franciscan
monk
would
become
the
greatest
and
most
sublime
prince
in
the
whole
world
the
father
of
all
christendom
that
is
indeed
a
happiness
that
brother
clement
upon
his
in
the
franciscan
convent
could
never
have
expected
you
then
consider
it
a
happiness
said
ganganelli
slowly
letting
himself
down
upon
the
yes
yes
such
are
you
good
human
beings
wherever
there
is
a
little
bit
of
show
a
little
bit
of
outward
splendor
you
immediately
conclude
that
there
is
great
happiness
this
proves
that
you
see
only
the
outward
form
paying
no
regard
to
what
is
concealed
under
that
form
and
which
is
often
very
bitter
believe
me
lorenzo
in
these
times
there
is
no
very
great
happiness
in
being
pope
and
the
father
of
christendom
the
princes
have
become
very
troublesome
and
disobedient
children
they
are
no
longer
willing
to
recognize
our
paternal
authority
and
if
the
holy
father
does
not
manifest
a
complaisant
friendliness
toward
these
refractory
princely
children
and
wink
at
their
independence
they
will
renounce
the
whole
connection
and
quit
the
paternal
mansion
we
should
then
indeed
be
the
holy
father
of
christendom
but
no
longer
have
any
children
under
the
paternal
authority
for
having
so
expressed
myself
i
shall
never
be
pardoned
by
the
cardinals
and
princes
of
the
church
it
has
made
them
my
deadly
enemies
and
yet
it
is
with
these
principles
alone
that
i
have
succeeded
in
bringing
the
refractory
portuguese
court
again
under
my
parental
control
but
here
in
this
pleasant
place
let
us
dismiss
such
unpleasant
thoughts
the
pope
more
cheerfully
continued
after
a
pause
here
i
will
forget
that
i
am
pope
here
i
will
never
be
anything
more
than
brother
clement
of
the
franciscan
convent
nor
shall
the
cares
and
troubles
of
the
pope
nor
his
holiness
or
infallibility
accompany
him
to
this
dear
quiet
place
here
i
will
only
be
a
man
and
forgetting
my
cramping
highness
and
my
forced
splendor
will
here
right
humanly
enjoy
the
sun
and
this
soft
green
grass
and
in
deep
draughts
inhale
this
sweet
balsamic
air
ah
how
happy
one
may
yet
be
if
he
can
for
a
moment
escape
from
the
envelope
of
dignity
by
which
he
is
kept
a
chrysalis
and
freely
exercise
the
butterfly
wings
of
manhood
and
hear
me
for
once
brother
lorenzo
so
very
human
has
your
pope
here
become
that
he
feels
a
right
fresh
human
appetite
if
all
here
is
as
it
used
to
be
at
the
convent
then
must
you
have
something
to
appease
my
brother
lorenzo
nodded
with
a
sly
smile
stepping
to
the
side
of
the
grassy
bank
and
slipping
aside
a
small
door
concealed
by
the
grass
he
disclosed
a
walled
excavation
filled
with
fruits
and
pastry
i
see
you
have
forgotten
nothing
joyfully
exclaimed
ganganelli
taking
some
of
the
fragrant
fruit
which
lorenzo
tendered
him
ah
you
make
me
very
happy
saying
this
he
threw
his
arm
around
lorenzo
s
neck
and
silently
pressed
him
to
his
bosom
brother
lorenzo
was
equally
silent
but
he
no
longer
laughed
his
usually
cheerful
face
assumed
a
wonderfully
clear
and
pleased
expression
and
two
large
tears
rolled
down
over
his
cheek
but
they
were
tears
of
joy
a
an
approaching
bustling
a
vehement
calling
and
screaming
disturbed
the
two
old
men
it
was
lorenzo
who
was
called
and
he
quickly
glided
through
the
bushes
to
look
after
the
cause
of
this
disturbance
but
soon
he
returned
with
a
melancholy
face
and
depressed
mien
brother
clement
said
he
it
is
already
all
over
with
our
enjoyment
which
has
been
so
great
for
me
that
i
forgot
to
remind
you
that
the
pope
can
not
neglect
the
hour
in
which
he
gives
audience
that
hour
has
now
come
and
your
anteroom
is
already
filled
with
princes
and
and
yet
you
speak
of
the
great
happiness
of
being
pope
said
ganganelli
rising
with
a
sigh
from
the
grassy
bank
i
am
not
allowed
an
hour
for
recreation
and
yet
people
think
but
no
said
ganganelli
interrupting
himself
and
laughing
we
should
not
be
ungrateful
and
it
would
be
ungrateful
for
me
now
to
complain
if
i
have
not
had
an
hour
for
recreation
well
i
have
had
half
an
hour
and
even
that
is
much
and
beckoning
to
brother
lorenzo
to
follow
him
the
pope
crept
through
the
bushes
that
separated
the
place
from
the
more
frequented
part
of
the
garden
as
he
then
walked
up
the
grand
alley
his
face
and
his
whole
form
assumed
a
very
different
appearance
the
mild
friendliness
had
vanished
from
his
features
pride
and
dignity
were
now
expressed
by
them
and
his
tall
erect
form
had
in
it
something
noble
and
imposing
it
was
no
longer
the
stooping
form
of
age
but
only
that
of
a
somewhat
elderly
hero
the
brother
clement
had
been
transformed
into
the
prince
of
the
church
who
was
about
to
receive
his
vassals
they
now
saw
a
tall
manly
form
hastening
down
the
alley
directly
toward
the
pope
who
is
it
asked
ganganelli
half
turning
toward
lorenzo
who
was
following
him
it
is
juan
angelo
braschi
the
former
treasurer
to
whom
you
yesterday
sent
the
cardinal
s
ah
the
beautiful
braschi
sadly
murmured
ganganelli
the
beloved
of
the
favorite
of
my
nephew
of
the
cardinal
rezzonico
ah
how
bad
the
world
is
in
fact
he
whom
ganganelli
called
the
beautiful
braschi
well
deserved
that
epithet
no
nobler
or
more
plastic
beauty
was
to
be
seen
no
face
that
more
reminded
one
of
the
divine
beauty
of
ancient
sculpture
no
form
that
could
be
called
a
better
counterfeit
of
the
belvedere
apollo
and
it
was
this
beauty
which
liberal
nature
had
imparted
to
him
as
its
noblest
gift
which
helped
juan
angelo
braschi
the
son
of
a
poor
nobleman
of
cesara
to
his
good
fortune
his
highest
offices
and
dignities
not
for
his
merits
but
solely
for
his
beauty
did
the
women
bestow
upon
him
their
love
and
as
among
these
women
there
were
some
who
exercised
an
important
influence
upon
powerful
cardinals
braschi
had
quickly
mounted
from
step
to
step
crowding
aside
those
who
had
nothing
but
their
merits
and
services
to
speak
for
them
with
a
free
and
noble
demeanor
braschi
now
approached
the
pope
who
remained
standing
at
some
distance
awaiting
him
with
a
calm
and
proud
braschi
dropped
upon
one
knee
and
pressing
the
hem
of
the
pope
s
garment
in
his
lips
said
pardon
me
most
holy
father
that
i
have
ventured
to
seek
you
here
but
my
lively
gratitude
would
not
be
longer
restrained
it
impelled
me
toward
you
with
the
wings
of
the
wind
i
must
be
the
first
to
fall
at
your
feet
to
stammer
out
to
you
my
inexpressible
proudly
nodding
his
head
the
pope
motioned
him
to
rise
it
is
well
said
he
and
you
have
lent
your
gratitude
an
abundance
of
words
it
is
true
you
were
only
treasurer
and
i
have
permitted
you
to
take
a
great
step
in
making
you
a
cardinal
but
remember
my
lord
cardinal
that
i
have
promoted
you
only
because
i
wished
to
take
from
you
the
office
of
treasurer
as
i
need
a
man
for
that
post
whose
honesty
no
one
could
call
in
question
thus
speaking
he
passed
on
with
a
ceremonious
salutation
leaving
the
new
cardinal
rooted
to
the
earth
with
terror
his
beautiful
brow
distorted
with
rage
he
shall
expiate
that
muttered
braschi
gnashing
his
teeth
as
the
pope
slowly
pursued
his
way
by
the
eternal
the
proud
franciscan
shall
expiate
that
ah
the
day
will
come
when
he
will
fully
remember
these
words
meantime
ganganelli
wandered
calmly
on
followed
by
his
faithful
lorenzo
with
a
smile
of
joy
at
this
dismissal
and
humiliation
of
the
proud
and
handsome
cardinal
braschi
the
pope
suddenly
stopped
and
turning
to
lorenzo
said
what
a
strange
thought
has
passed
through
my
head
i
have
made
this
miserable
coxcomb
braschi
a
cardinal
because
he
was
not
honest
enough
for
a
treasurer
but
in
doing
so
i
have
paved
the
way
for
him
to
the
papal
throne
would
it
not
be
strange
lorenzo
if
i
have
thus
myself
provided
my
successor
his
dishonesty
and
intriguing
disposition
has
made
him
a
cardinal
why
can
it
not
also
make
him
a
pope
the
world
is
indeed
so
strange
juan
angelo
braschi
whom
pope
clement
xiv
made
a
cardinal
was
in
fact
ganganelli
s
successor
and
took
possession
of
the
papal
chair
as
pius
vi
he
was
chosen
after
a
very
stormy
conclave
and
indeed
the
different
parties
voted
for
him
on
the
ground
that
he
belonged
to
no
party
and
because
they
thought
he
was
so
very
much
occupied
with
his
own
beauty
that
he
would
think
of
nothing
else
and
while
occupied
with
the
care
of
his
face
would
leave
the
cares
of
state
to
others
what
dreams
those
are
murmured
lorenzo
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
idea
that
a
braschi
could
be
the
successor
of
the
noble
ganganelli
many
cardinals
and
princes
of
the
church
many
noblemen
and
foreign
ambassadors
were
assembled
in
the
pope
s
and
as
ganganelli
entered
they
all
received
him
with
joyful
acclamations
and
humbly
fell
upon
their
knees
before
the
head
of
the
church
the
vicegerent
of
god
who
with
solemn
majesty
bestowed
upon
them
his
blessing
and
then
condescendingly
conversed
with
them
that
was
a
ceremony
to
which
the
pope
was
obliged
to
subject
himself
once
a
week
and
which
he
reckoned
as
not
one
of
the
least
of
the
troubles
attendant
upon
his
exalted
position
hence
he
was
well
pleased
when
this
hour
was
over
and
he
at
length
was
relieved
of
the
presence
of
all
these
eulogistic
and
flattering
gentlemen
only
cardinal
bernis
had
remained
behind
and
to
him
ganganelli
giving
him
his
hand
and
drawing
a
deep
breath
said
what
a
mass
of
false
and
hypocritical
phrases
we
have
again
been
obliged
to
swallow
these
cardinals
have
the
impudence
to
speak
to
me
of
their
love
and
veneration
they
do
not
hesitate
so
to
lie
with
the
same
lips
which
have
already
pronounced
blessings
and
pious
words
of
edification
but
let
us
forget
these
hypocrites
business
is
over
and
it
is
kind
of
you
to
come
and
chat
with
me
for
one
little
hour
you
know
i
love
you
very
much
my
good
friend
bernis
although
you
do
pay
homage
to
the
heathen
divinities
and
as
a
real
renegade
have
constituted
yourself
a
priest
of
the
ah
you
speak
of
my
youthful
sins
said
the
cardinal
smiling
they
are
long
since
past
and
sleep
with
my
youthful
that
must
be
a
wide
bed
which
enables
them
all
to
find
place
side
by
side
responded
ganganelli
laughing
and
holding
up
his
forefinger
threateningly
to
the
cardinal
but
what
is
that
you
are
drawing
from
your
with
such
an
important
air
a
letter
from
the
marquise
de
pompadour
holy
father
seriously
replied
the
cardinal
a
letter
in
which
i
am
commanded
to
communicate
to
you
the
father
of
christendom
the
acquiescence
of
france
in
your
proposed
abolition
of
the
order
of
the
jesuits
here
is
a
private
letter
addressed
to
me
by
the
marquise
and
here
the
official
letter
signed
by
king
louis
which
is
destined
for
your
the
pope
took
the
papers
and
while
he
was
reading
them
his
face
turned
deadly
pale
and
a
dark
cloud
gathered
upon
his
brow
france
also
acquiesces
said
he
when
he
had
finished
the
reading
how
is
it
then
were
you
not
yourself
against
the
abolition
of
the
order
and
were
you
not
in
accordance
with
the
spanish
ambassador
your
friend
of
many
years
this
friendship
of
many
years
is
destroyed
by
a
fish
and
drives
us
a
helpless
wreck
upon
the
waves
said
the
cardinal
shrugging
his
shoulders
ganganelli
paid
no
attention
to
him
serious
and
thoughtful
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
while
his
eye
seemed
to
address
a
great
and
question
to
the
being
there
above
which
received
no
answer
i
clearly
see
how
it
will
be
finally
murmured
the
pope
as
if
talking
to
himself
i
shall
complete
the
work
i
have
begun
it
is
god
himself
who
has
opened
the
way
for
it
but
this
way
will
at
the
same
time
lead
me
to
my
what
dark
thoughts
are
these
said
bernis
approaching
him
this
bold
and
resolution
will
not
bring
you
death
but
fame
and
it
will
at
least
lead
me
to
immortality
said
the
pope
with
a
faint
smile
the
dead
are
all
immortal
but
think
not
so
little
of
me
as
to
suppose
i
would
now
timidly
shrink
from
doing
that
which
i
have
once
recognized
as
right
and
necessary
only
there
are
necessities
of
a
very
painful
and
dreadful
kind
such
a
necessity
is
war
and
is
it
not
a
war
that
i
commence
and
does
it
not
involve
the
destruction
of
all
those
thousands
who
call
themselves
the
followers
of
loyola
and
belong
to
the
society
of
jesus
ah
believe
me
this
society
of
jesus
is
a
hydra
and
we
shall
never
succeed
in
entirely
extirpating
it
i
may
now
separate
my
own
head
from
my
body
but
a
day
will
come
when
the
head
of
this
hydra
will
have
grown
again
and
when
it
will
rise
from
the
dead
with
renewed
vitality
while
i
shall
be
mouldering
in
my
grave
say
not
therefore
that
i
know
not
how
to
destroy
them
and
if
you
do
say
it
at
least
add
that
i
lacked
not
the
will
but
that
i
gave
for
it
my
own
thus
speaking
the
pope
slightly
nodded
an
adieu
to
the
cardinal
and
withdrew
into
his
study
the
door
of
which
he
carefully
closed
after
him
there
was
he
long
heard
to
walk
the
room
with
measured
steps
then
all
was
still
no
one
ventured
to
disturb
him
hours
passed
lorenzo
with
a
fearful
presentiment
knelt
before
the
door
he
laid
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
tried
to
listen
all
was
still
within
nothing
stirred
at
length
he
ventured
to
call
the
pope
s
name
at
first
low
and
tremulously
then
louder
and
more
anxiously
and
as
no
answer
was
received
he
at
last
ventured
to
open
the
door
at
his
sat
the
pope
his
face
deadly
pale
with
staring
eyes
and
great
drops
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
immovable
sat
he
there
his
right
hand
which
held
a
pen
resting
on
a
parchment
lying
upon
the
table
before
him
like
an
image
of
wax
so
stiff
so
motionless
was
he
that
lorenzo
shuddering
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
his
brow
then
noiselessly
advancing
he
timidly
and
anxiously
touched
the
pope
s
shoulder
ganganelli
shuddered
and
a
slight
trembling
pervaded
his
members
he
then
drew
a
long
breath
and
casting
a
dull
glance
at
his
faithful
friend
said
lorenzo
let
my
coffin
be
ordered
and
pray
for
my
soul
i
have
just
now
signed
my
own
see
there
it
lies
i
have
signed
the
decree
abolishing
the
order
of
the
jesuits
i
must
therefore
die
lorenzo
it
is
all
over
and
past
with
our
shady
place
and
our
recreations
my
murderers
are
already
prowling
around
me
for
i
tell
you
i
have
myself
signed
my
the
festival
of
cardinal
bernis
and
this
day
of
the
festival
had
finally
come
with
what
joyful
impatience
with
what
anxious
desire
had
natalie
looked
forward
to
it
how
had
she
importuned
her
friend
count
paulo
with
questions
about
cardinal
bernis
about
the
people
she
would
meet
there
about
the
manners
and
usages
with
which
she
would
have
to
conform
i
am
anxious
and
fearful
said
she
with
amiable
modesty
they
will
find
occasion
to
laugh
at
me
and
you
will
be
compelled
to
blush
for
me
paulo
but
you
must
tell
these
wise
men
and
great
ladies
that
it
is
my
very
first
appearance
in
society
and
that
they
must
have
consideration
for
the
awkwardness
and
ineptitude
of
a
poor
child
who
knows
nothing
of
the
world
its
forms
or
its
for
you
no
excuse
will
be
necessary
responded
paulo
pressing
the
delicate
tips
of
her
fingers
to
his
lips
only
be
quite
yourself
perfectly
true
and
open
inoffensive
and
cheerful
forget
that
you
are
in
an
assemblage
imagine
yourself
to
be
in
our
garden
under
the
trees
and
among
the
flowers
and
speak
to
people
as
you
speak
to
your
trees
and
but
will
the
people
give
me
as
true
and
cordial
answers
as
my
trees
and
flowers
asked
natalie
thoughtfully
they
will
say
to
you
more
beautiful
and
more
flattering
things
said
paulo
smiling
but
now
natalie
it
is
time
to
be
thinking
of
your
toilet
see
the
sun
is
already
sinking
behind
the
pines
and
the
sky
begins
to
redden
the
time
to
go
will
soon
arrive
and
your
first
triumph
awaits
you
oh
it
will
not
have
long
to
wait
said
natalie
laughing
and
light
and
graceful
as
a
gazelle
she
tripped
to
the
house
count
paulo
gazed
after
her
with
a
melancholy
rapture
and
i
am
to
leave
this
angel
thought
he
to
lose
the
brightest
and
noblest
jewel
of
my
life
and
drive
myself
out
of
paradise
and
wherefore
all
this
perhaps
to
chase
a
phantom
that
will
never
become
a
reality
to
follow
a
chimera
which
may
be
only
a
meteor
that
dances
before
me
and
dissolves
into
mist
when
i
think
to
reach
it
no
no
the
world
is
not
worth
so
much
that
one
should
sell
himself
and
his
soul
s
happiness
for
its
splendor
and
its
greatness
natalie
herself
shall
decide
loves
she
me
and
is
she
satisfied
with
the
quiet
circumscribed
existence
that
i
can
henceforth
only
offer
her
then
away
ye
vain
dreams
and
ye
proud
desires
for
greatness
then
shall
i
be
if
not
the
greatest
certainly
the
happiest
of
human
beings
it
was
a
wonderfully
brilliant
festival
that
cardinal
bernis
had
prepared
for
his
guests
a
festival
hitherto
unequalled
in
rome
the
walls
were
decorated
with
garlands
and
festoons
of
flowers
the
flaming
candelabras
among
which
found
their
reflection
in
the
tall
venetian
mirrors
that
rose
in
their
golden
frames
from
the
floor
to
the
ceilings
and
in
the
corners
of
the
rooms
were
niches
here
furnished
with
and
there
with
heavy
silk
curtains
behind
which
were
grottoes
adorned
with
shells
in
the
midst
of
which
were
fountains
where
splashed
waters
rendered
fragrant
by
oil
of
roses
and
other
essences
and
surprises
new
grottoes
and
groves
in
those
rich
halls
offered
themselves
to
the
eyes
of
the
beholders
now
one
suddenly
found
himself
in
a
quiet
boudoir
lighted
only
by
a
solitary
lamp
where
the
most
artistic
engravings
and
the
rarest
drawings
were
spread
out
upon
a
table
then
again
one
entered
a
hall
sparkling
with
a
thousand
lights
and
resounding
with
music
where
the
crowd
undulated
in
mazy
waves
then
again
grottoes
opened
here
and
there
or
one
stepped
out
through
the
open
doors
into
the
garden
where
one
could
enjoy
the
balsamic
coolness
of
the
evening
in
walks
brilliantly
lighted
with
colored
lamps
or
listen
to
the
music
of
performers
concealed
in
the
shrubbery
or
again
fleeing
from
the
throng
and
the
lights
seek
a
upon
some
grassy
bank
or
under
some
whether
for
solitary
musing
or
for
encircling
in
sweet
and
silent
familiarity
the
waist
of
some
chosen
fair
one
who
understanding
the
stolen
glance
had
strayed
here
unnoticed
but
the
central
point
of
the
festival
was
the
monstrous
gigantic
hall
which
the
cardinal
had
caused
to
be
erected
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
expressly
for
this
occasion
the
walls
of
muslin
and
flowers
were
held
together
by
more
than
a
hundred
gilded
pillars
the
girandoles
attached
to
each
of
which
diffused
a
sea
of
light
silken
carpets
covered
the
floor
and
the
of
this
gigantic
hall
was
formed
by
the
arch
of
heaven
here
also
niches
and
grottoes
were
everywhere
to
be
found
in
them
one
could
in
the
midst
of
the
constantly
moving
and
noisy
crowd
enjoy
quiet
and
repose
only
one
of
these
niches
was
inaccessible
as
it
appears
to
the
company
and
yet
it
was
precisely
this
which
excited
the
curiosity
of
all
and
which
all
whispering
approached
anxious
to
get
a
peep
behind
the
closed
thick
silken
curtains
before
which
two
richly
gallooned
servants
of
the
cardinal
walked
back
and
forth
with
solemn
earnestness
but
respectfully
requesting
every
one
to
comply
with
the
cardinal
s
wishes
and
not
approach
the
mysterious
drapery
but
await
his
own
time
for
the
solution
of
the
enigma
a
few
steps
led
up
to
this
closed
and
covered
niche
these
steps
were
strewed
with
roses
that
was
plainly
seen
but
to
what
did
these
steps
lead
and
what
was
thus
carefully
concealed
a
precious
surprise
certainly
for
it
was
the
forte
of
the
cardinal
to
prepare
surprises
for
the
agreeable
entertainment
of
his
guests
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
cardinals
and
princes
of
the
church
crowded
around
him
begging
for
an
explanation
of
the
mystery
a
disclosure
of
the
secret
i
am
myself
uninitiated
said
cardinal
bernis
laughing
some
divinity
may
have
taken
a
seat
there
or
perhaps
it
is
a
sphinx
which
will
from
thence
give
us
the
solution
of
her
enigma
but
let
us
see
what
belated
guests
are
now
coming
to
and
the
cardinal
with
zealous
precipitation
approached
the
principal
entrance
to
the
hall
the
of
which
had
just
been
drawn
aside
and
behind
was
seen
natalie
at
the
hand
of
paulo
as
if
blinded
by
the
sudden
flood
of
light
she
stood
for
a
moment
still
a
purple
glow
flushing
her
delicate
cheeks
and
clinging
to
paulo
s
arms
she
whispered
protect
me
paulo
i
am
so
frightened
by
this
crowd
just
at
that
moment
the
doorkeeper
cried
with
a
loud
voice
princess
natalie
tartaroff
and
count
paulo
at
the
sound
of
these
strange
names
all
glanced
toward
the
door
and
all
flaming
curious
prying
eyes
were
fixed
with
astonishment
and
admiration
upon
the
young
maiden
but
natalie
did
not
remark
it
she
glanced
at
paulo
with
a
glad
smile
and
a
proud
happiness
beamed
from
her
features
she
had
then
a
name
she
was
no
longer
an
abandoned
nameless
orphan
at
length
the
enigma
of
her
birth
was
solved
and
what
she
had
so
often
prayed
for
count
paulo
had
vouchsafed
her
as
a
surprise
he
had
at
the
same
time
announced
her
name
to
herself
and
the
world
and
she
not
only
had
a
name
but
she
was
a
princess
she
took
a
rank
in
the
company
and
count
paulo
and
carlo
had
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
her
but
where
was
carlo
at
the
thought
of
him
this
feeling
of
effervescing
pride
vanished
from
the
young
maiden
s
heart
she
even
forgot
that
she
was
a
princess
to
remember
only
that
carlo
her
had
promised
her
to
be
present
at
this
festival
and
to
wonder
that
she
could
not
discover
him
in
this
gay
and
confused
assemblage
she
did
not
remark
that
since
her
appearance
a
deep
stillness
had
supervened
in
the
hall
that
all
eyes
were
upon
her
that
people
secretly
whispered
to
each
other
and
gave
utterance
to
murmured
expressions
of
astonishment
and
delight
she
saw
not
how
the
beauties
here
and
there
turned
pale
and
indignantly
bit
their
proud
lips
she
saw
not
how
the
eyes
of
the
men
glowed
and
flashed
and
what
eagerly
lusting
glances
the
cardinals
and
princes
of
the
church
cast
upon
her
she
was
so
unconstrained
this
charming
child
she
knew
not
how
handsome
she
was
but
she
was
of
a
wonderfully
touching
beauty
like
a
white
and
delicate
lily
stood
she
there
in
the
heavy
white
satin
robe
that
enveloped
her
graceful
form
and
the
brilliants
that
adorned
her
hair
neck
and
arms
shone
and
sparkled
like
in
the
calyx
of
the
flower
so
beautiful
was
she
that
even
cardinal
bernis
stood
speechless
and
as
if
blinded
before
her
finding
no
expression
for
his
joyful
surprise
and
astonishment
oh
at
length
he
smilingly
said
with
a
low
bow
i
shall
have
to
quarrel
with
count
paulo
he
promised
us
the
presence
of
a
mortal
woman
and
now
he
leads
into
our
circle
a
divinity
who
must
look
down
upon
us
poor
human
beings
with
a
smile
of
natalie
smiled
i
know
said
she
with
her
clear
sweet
childish
voice
i
know
that
cardinal
bernis
is
a
poet
and
therefore
it
will
not
be
very
difficult
for
him
to
change
a
young
maiden
into
a
divinity
nor
is
this
the
first
time
he
has
done
so
i
remember
a
lovely
poem
of
his
the
complaint
of
a
shepherd
who
considers
the
object
of
his
love
a
divinity
because
she
is
so
beautiful
and
at
last
she
proves
to
be
no
divinity
but
on
the
contrary
a
regular
little
quarrelsome
wrangler
who
has
nothing
beautiful
about
her
but
her
hands
and
face
take
care
cardinal
that
it
does
not
prove
with
you
and
me
as
with
the
shepherd
in
your
charming
poem
she
said
that
with
such
childish
ingenuousness
and
in
so
cheerful
and
jesting
a
tone
that
the
cardinal
listened
to
her
as
if
intoxicated
and
with
unconcealed
admiration
he
looked
into
that
delicate
childishly
pure
face
over
which
no
trace
of
sorrow
nor
any
sign
of
care
had
ever
yet
passed
without
answering
he
took
her
arm
and
beckoning
count
paulo
to
his
side
led
the
princess
to
the
circle
of
ladies
behind
those
closed
curtains
that
still
concealed
the
mysterious
niche
it
had
meanwhile
become
stirring
busy
servants
hastened
hither
and
thither
lighting
the
lamps
and
arranging
the
festoons
and
draperies
it
seems
they
had
here
erected
a
little
stage
and
the
large
that
formed
the
background
of
this
stage
bore
the
appearance
of
a
decoration
a
side
curtain
serving
as
a
partition
formed
a
second
room
which
seemed
destined
for
a
sort
of
greenroom
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
large
and
mirror
and
before
it
stood
a
young
woman
regarding
herself
with
the
greatest
attention
here
plucking
at
her
dress
and
there
arranging
her
train
or
an
ornament
she
was
evidently
the
one
who
was
to
appear
upon
the
stage
her
costume
betrayed
it
it
was
not
the
fashionable
costume
of
the
day
such
as
was
worn
by
the
distinguished
ladies
of
roman
society
it
was
an
ideal
greek
dress
that
seemed
to
have
been
made
for
the
purpose
of
displaying
and
rendering
yet
more
voluptuous
and
enticing
the
great
beauty
of
the
wearer
she
was
very
beautiful
this
woman
with
her
sparkling
black
eyes
and
dark
shining
hair
which
had
been
gathered
into
a
grecian
knot
behind
beautiful
with
the
resting
upon
her
high
forehead
beautiful
in
the
transparent
grecian
robe
which
only
so
far
concealed
the
luxuriant
forms
of
her
full
figure
as
to
allow
them
to
be
divined
beautiful
with
those
full
round
and
entirely
uncovered
arms
with
their
jewelled
bracelets
beautiful
with
her
graceful
neck
her
fully
exposed
naked
shoulders
and
her
voluptuously
swelling
bosom
she
was
in
her
appearance
a
greek
only
her
face
was
not
grecian
it
was
wanting
in
the
noble
forms
the
still
cheerfulness
and
repose
of
grecian
beauty
modest
even
in
its
voluptuousness
it
was
only
the
face
of
a
sensual
and
passionate
roman
woman
and
no
lais
would
have
ventured
such
a
smile
as
played
upon
the
lips
of
this
roman
woman
or
such
glowing
glances
as
she
shot
like
arrows
from
her
dark
eyes
standing
before
the
glass
she
viewed
herself
her
lips
murmuring
low
words
occasionally
turning
her
eyes
from
the
mirror
to
the
little
table
standing
near
it
upon
which
lay
several
open
books
what
murmured
she
and
what
read
she
in
those
books
singular
she
was
uttering
single
isolated
unconnected
words
which
had
nothing
in
common
with
each
other
but
the
sound
of
melody
they
were
rhymes
but
without
connection
or
sense
without
inward
mental
correlation
so
she
now
said
to
herself
with
a
satisfied
smile
i
am
now
perfectly
armed
and
prepared
all
these
rhymes
ready
for
use
and
i
have
not
to
fear
embarrassment
in
repeating
any
of
them
ah
they
shall
admire
me
these
good
romans
i
will
animate
and
inflame
them
and
excite
all
my
enamored
cardinals
to
such
an
ecstasy
that
they
must
finally
prevail
upon
the
silly
obstinate
old
pope
against
his
own
will
to
fulfil
my
only
desire
i
will
attain
my
end
even
if
i
am
compelled
to
pawn
my
honor
and
my
salvation
for
it
bah
honor
what
can
honor
be
to
a
woman
beauty
is
our
honor
further
nothing
and
fair
it
seems
to
me
i
yet
am
and
if
i
am
fair
she
more
glowingly
continued
after
a
pause
how
comes
it
that
carlo
has
ceased
to
love
me
ah
the
false
one
to
betray
and
desert
me
when
i
love
him
most
a
dark
flush
of
anger
now
overspread
her
cheeks
and
threateningly
raising
her
hands
with
compressed
lips
she
continued
and
to
desert
me
for
another
woman
me
the
pride
and
delight
of
all
rome
me
whom
all
the
princes
and
cardinals
worship
ah
while
thousands
lie
at
my
feet
imploring
for
a
glance
or
a
smile
this
little
unknown
singer
dares
to
scorn
me
and
deride
my
love
and
why
should
he
not
dare
it
asked
a
voice
behind
her
and
the
face
of
a
young
man
became
visible
carlo
she
cried
hastening
to
meet
him
with
outspread
arms
he
almost
ungently
checked
her
you
forget
said
he
that
this
little
insignificant
and
unknown
singer
loves
you
no
longer
corilla
grant
then
henceforth
to
the
thousands
who
languish
at
your
feet
a
few
of
your
enticing
smiles
and
glowing
glances
i
have
nothing
against
it
and
am
not
at
all
jealous
but
you
should
be
cried
she
stamping
her
feet
with
rage
i
tell
you
i
will
not
suffer
you
to
leave
me
i
will
be
loved
by
you
and
no
one
shall
you
dare
to
look
at
and
no
one
shall
you
dare
to
love
but
me
carlo
broke
out
into
a
scornful
laugh
and
then
seriously
and
proudly
said
i
am
a
neapolitan
and
with
us
men
do
not
allow
themselves
to
be
constrained
to
love
and
no
woman
there
dares
utter
the
command
thou
shalt
love
me
i
will
not
signora
corilla
you
will
not
screamed
she
gnashing
her
teeth
then
woe
to
you
and
to
her
i
fear
no
serpents
said
carlo
laughing
and
if
an
adder
attempts
to
sting
me
i
tread
it
under
foot
but
fear
at
least
for
her
you
love
she
threateningly
said
oh
you
think
i
shall
not
be
able
to
discover
this
secret
love
of
yours
and
not
spy
out
this
new
divinity
to
whom
you
have
consecrated
your
heart
tremble
therefore
now
for
i
know
her
i
know
the
garden
in
which
she
lives
and
there
is
a
place
in
the
wall
just
opposite
her
favorite
seat
whoever
knows
that
place
and
possesses
a
steady
hand
and
a
sharp
dagger
will
know
how
to
hurl
it
so
as
to
pierce
her
carlo
felt
a
deadly
terror
he
felt
his
heart
stand
still
but
he
collected
himself
and
said
with
a
contemptuous
smile
cardinal
francesco
albani
indeed
possesses
among
his
many
such
skilful
hands
and
surely
it
will
not
require
many
of
your
glances
to
induce
him
to
favor
you
with
the
loan
of
one
of
the
signora
slightly
bit
her
lips
you
mock
me
she
almost
sadly
said
and
yet
you
should
remember
that
it
is
only
love
that
makes
me
so
savage
and
fills
my
heart
with
a
thirst
for
vengeance
carlo
i
so
warmly
love
you
and
the
beautiful
glowing
woman
humbly
and
imploringly
bent
before
her
beloved
the
latter
laughingly
said
how
well
you
know
how
to
say
that
with
what
variations
and
modulations
i
yesterday
heard
you
say
the
same
to
cardinal
albani
to
be
sure
it
sounded
a
little
different
but
not
less
warm
and
glowing
you
know
why
i
do
that
said
she
he
is
an
enamored
fool
whom
i
would
win
with
tender
words
that
i
may
make
him
my
instrument
you
know
the
object
for
which
i
strive
and
which
i
must
attain
at
any
price
ah
carlo
when
once
they
have
crowned
me
in
the
capitol
then
i
am
sure
you
will
be
compelled
to
love
me
again
never
again
he
harshly
and
roughly
said
is
that
your
last
word
shrieked
she
with
flashing
eyes
and
the
wild
rage
of
a
tigress
it
is
my
last
word
she
flew
to
him
like
a
mad
person
seized
his
hands
and
fixedly
stared
him
in
the
face
ungrateful
said
she
gnashing
her
teeth
is
it
thus
you
reward
my
love
is
this
your
return
for
all
i
have
done
for
you
can
you
forget
that
it
was
i
who
withdrew
you
from
poverty
and
baseness
what
were
you
but
a
poor
unnoticed
singer
in
the
streets
on
whom
people
bestowed
scanty
alms
was
it
not
i
who
rescued
you
from
that
shame
and
clothed
you
and
gave
you
a
home
was
it
not
i
who
gave
you
a
name
and
procured
you
consideration
and
respect
by
making
you
my
singer
and
companion
and
allowing
you
to
play
upon
the
harp
at
my
improvisations
how
has
not
all
rome
admired
you
when
you
sang
the
canzones
i
wrote
for
you
thereby
procuring
you
honor
and
respectability
and
making
you
a
popular
man
from
a
low
beggar
go
you
can
not
leave
me
for
you
are
my
creature
my
property
he
wildly
thrust
her
aside
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
indignation
signora
said
he
his
lips
tremulous
with
rage
you
have
rent
the
last
band
that
bound
me
to
you
and
in
twitting
me
of
your
benefits
you
have
annihilated
them
we
now
have
nothing
in
common
with
each
other
except
perhaps
mutual
hatred
and
that
i
hope
will
have
a
longer
duration
than
our
love
and
carlo
turned
toward
the
door
corilla
rushed
after
him
with
an
exclamation
of
terror
you
will
leave
me
now
cried
she
with
anguish
now
in
this
hour
when
you
are
so
indispensable
to
me
now
when
i
am
to
celebrate
a
new
triumph
before
this
notable
assembly
when
all
eyes
are
expectantly
turned
to
the
curtain
behind
which
i
am
to
appear
no
no
carlo
from
compassion
remain
with
me
only
one
hour
only
this
evening
carlo
smiled
contemptuously
i
will
remain
said
he
for
i
have
promised
that
she
shall
hear
you
she
has
therefore
come
cried
corilla
with
an
outburst
of
joy
she
is
now
here
he
laconically
said
corilla
no
longer
listened
to
him
she
walked
back
and
forth
with
a
triumphant
mien
a
cruel
malicious
smile
playing
upon
her
lips
at
this
moment
there
was
a
slight
knock
at
the
door
which
was
opened
and
a
man
who
appeared
upon
the
threshold
glanced
into
the
room
with
a
grinning
laugh
corilla
gave
him
a
sign
and
at
the
same
time
pointed
at
carlo
who
having
his
back
toward
her
seemed
to
have
no
suspicion
of
what
was
occurring
behind
him
but
he
saw
it
nevertheless
in
the
tall
mirror
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
saw
corilla
make
signs
of
intelligence
with
that
man
who
was
in
the
livery
of
cardinal
francesco
albani
he
saw
the
man
make
answer
with
his
fingers
and
then
draw
forth
a
dagger
which
he
threateningly
swung
over
his
head
oh
carlo
had
very
well
understood
what
that
man
said
as
he
also
did
that
language
of
the
fingers
this
language
of
the
romans
and
neapolitans
the
man
had
said
she
is
here
that
beautiful
lady
she
can
no
longer
escape
us
you
will
strike
her
had
corilla
asked
the
man
had
swung
the
dagger
over
his
head
and
held
up
two
fingers
of
his
right
hand
that
signified
in
two
hours
she
will
be
good
you
shall
be
satisfied
with
me
had
been
corilla
s
answer
the
door
was
again
closed
corilla
turned
smiling
to
carlo
her
former
rancor
seemed
to
have
vanished
she
was
in
high
spirits
carlo
said
she
how
good
you
are
not
to
leave
me
let
us
now
begin
i
feel
myself
glowing
with
inspiration
ah
i
shall
enrapture
these
good
romans
i
think
how
long
will
this
improvisation
last
carlo
gruffly
asked
well
one
or
two
hours
according
to
the
delight
we
give
our
if
this
farce
continues
longer
than
an
hour
and
a
half
i
shall
throw
down
my
harp
and
go
away
said
carlo
in
a
tone
of
severity
i
swear
it
to
you
by
the
spirit
of
my
mother
remember
it
i
shall
show
you
the
time
every
quarter
of
an
you
are
a
tyrant
said
she
laughing
but
i
suppose
i
must
submit
give
therefore
the
signal
that
we
are
the
improvisatrice
all
the
guests
of
the
cardinal
were
assembled
in
the
gigantic
hall
and
all
eyes
were
anxiously
bent
upon
the
mysterious
curtain
which
still
remained
closed
now
resounded
a
little
bell
and
cardinal
bernis
smilingly
turned
to
natalie
who
sat
by
his
side
i
think
this
mystery
is
about
to
be
unveiled
said
he
and
i
am
quite
anxious
about
it
said
the
young
maiden
gracefully
laying
her
hand
upon
her
heart
my
heart
beats
as
violently
as
if
a
mystery
were
about
to
be
unveiled
in
my
own
breast
do
you
believe
in
presentiments
sir
cardinal
bernis
had
not
time
to
answer
her
just
at
that
moment
the
curtain
drew
up
a
general
ah
of
admiration
was
heard
and
suddenly
carried
away
by
their
feelings
the
whole
audience
broke
into
extravagant
and
applause
crying
and
shouting
corilla
l
improvisatrice
corilla
and
in
fact
it
was
an
admirable
picture
which
was
there
presented
to
the
audience
those
steps
led
up
to
an
altar
upon
the
centre
of
which
between
wreaths
of
flowers
shot
up
two
flames
against
that
altar
leaned
exalted
and
august
as
a
grecian
priestess
the
improvisatrice
corilla
her
eyes
raised
to
the
heavens
her
features
lighted
up
with
a
rosy
glow
by
the
red
flames
her
right
arm
resting
upon
an
urn
while
her
left
arm
was
stretched
upward
toward
heaven
she
thus
resembled
an
inspired
priestess
just
receiving
a
message
from
on
high
listening
with
ecstasy
with
suppressed
breath
and
parted
lips
to
the
voice
of
the
deity
and
forgetting
the
world
in
a
blissful
intoxication
she
seemed
about
to
take
her
flight
to
the
empyrean
and
while
corilla
as
if
absorbed
in
spiritual
contemplation
continued
to
stand
immovable
there
began
the
low
notes
of
a
harp
which
gradually
becoming
fuller
and
stronger
at
length
resounded
in
powerfully
rushing
and
exultant
tones
from
corilla
all
eyes
were
now
turned
upon
carlo
who
in
the
light
dress
of
a
greek
youth
his
harp
upon
his
arm
was
leaning
against
a
pomegranate
tree
placed
in
the
background
of
the
stage
and
with
his
pale
serious
face
with
his
noble
manly
features
formed
a
beautiful
contrast
to
the
inspired
and
priestess
corilla
natalie
feeling
something
like
a
slight
puncture
in
her
heart
involuntarily
carried
her
hand
to
her
bosom
it
was
a
strange
a
wonderful
feeling
which
stirred
within
her
partly
partaking
of
joy
at
seeing
and
hearing
her
friend
carlo
as
people
were
murmuring
praises
of
his
beauty
and
of
his
great
skill
upon
the
harp
and
partly
a
feeling
of
painful
emotion
she
knew
not
why
but
as
her
glance
met
his
it
quickly
turned
toward
corilla
and
quite
sadly
she
said
to
herself
she
is
much
handsomer
than
i
carlo
now
opened
his
lips
and
to
a
beautifully
simple
melody
he
sweetly
sang
an
introductory
song
as
it
were
to
prepare
the
audience
for
the
coming
solemnity
having
finished
this
two
lovely
came
forward
with
silver
vases
in
their
hands
and
hastened
down
the
steps
to
the
audience
politely
requesting
them
to
furnish
themes
for
the
great
improvisatrice
corilla
then
returning
to
the
altar
they
threw
into
the
urn
the
small
scraps
of
paper
on
which
the
guests
has
proposed
themes
the
harp
again
resounded
and
with
a
solemn
earnestness
her
face
and
glance
still
directed
upward
corilla
drew
one
of
the
little
strips
of
paper
from
the
urn
accident
or
perhaps
her
own
dexterity
had
favored
her
sappho
s
lament
before
throwing
herself
from
the
rocks
that
was
the
theme
proposed
corilla
s
face
immediately
took
an
expression
of
sadness
her
eyes
flashed
with
an
unnatural
fire
her
previously
raised
arm
fell
powerless
by
her
side
her
head
like
a
broken
rose
sank
upon
her
breast
her
other
hand
convulsively
grasped
the
urn
and
in
this
position
she
in
fact
resembled
an
abandoned
mourner
weeping
over
the
ashes
of
her
lost
happiness
she
was
now
the
repudiated
and
forsaken
one
who
ready
to
resign
her
life
was
brooding
upon
thoughts
of
death
and
while
her
face
took
this
expression
and
she
staring
upon
the
earth
before
her
seemed
to
be
meditating
upon
irremediable
fate
thought
corilla
this
is
a
charming
theme
which
the
good
cardinal
albani
has
thrown
into
the
urn
for
me
i
found
it
directly
by
the
small
pin
which
according
to
his
promise
he
inserted
in
the
paper
this
cardinal
is
an
agreeable
imp
and
i
must
give
him
a
kiss
for
his
complaisance
besides
the
tasso
rhyme
will
here
be
the
most
appropriate
again
she
directed
her
gaze
with
a
gloomy
expression
toward
the
heavens
and
with
a
violently
heaving
bosom
with
feverishly
flitting
breath
she
began
the
lament
of
sappho
now
like
rattling
thunder
now
like
the
gentle
breathings
of
the
flute
rolled
this
sweet
and
picturesque
language
of
italy
from
her
lips
like
music
sounded
those
full
artistic
rhymes
of
which
but
few
of
the
hearers
had
the
least
suspicion
that
they
came
from
tasso
to
improvise
in
the
italian
language
is
an
easy
and
a
grateful
task
what
wonder
then
that
corilla
acquitted
herself
so
charmingly
the
audience
paid
no
attention
to
the
thoughts
expressed
they
asked
not
after
the
quintessence
they
were
satisfied
with
the
agreeable
sound
without
inquiring
into
the
sense
of
her
words
it
was
their
melody
which
was
admired
they
listened
not
for
the
thought
but
only
for
the
rhyme
and
with
ecstatic
smiles
and
admiring
glances
they
nodded
to
each
other
when
thanks
to
the
studies
which
corilla
had
made
in
tasso
marino
and
ariosto
she
seemed
of
herself
to
find
rhymes
for
the
most
difficult
words
an
immense
storm
of
applause
resounded
when
she
ended
and
as
if
awakening
from
an
intoxicating
ecstasy
corilla
glanced
around
with
an
expression
of
astonishment
on
her
features
she
looked
around
as
if
she
knew
not
whence
she
came
and
in
what
strange
surroundings
she
now
found
herself
after
a
short
pause
which
carlo
filled
out
with
his
harp
she
again
put
her
hand
into
the
urn
and
drew
out
a
new
theme
again
the
inspiration
seemed
to
pass
over
her
and
the
holy
whitsuntide
of
her
muse
to
be
renewed
constantly
more
and
more
stormily
resounded
the
plaudits
of
her
hearers
it
was
like
a
continued
thunder
of
enthusiasm
a
real
salvo
of
joy
it
animated
corilla
to
new
improvisations
she
again
and
again
recurred
to
the
urn
drawing
forth
new
themes
and
seemed
to
be
absolutely
inexhaustible
it
is
now
enough
whispered
carlo
just
as
she
had
drawn
forth
a
new
theme
you
have
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
left
only
this
theme
yet
she
begged
in
a
low
tone
it
is
a
very
happy
one
it
will
win
for
me
the
hearts
of
all
these
cardinals
and
gentlemen
yet
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
your
time
is
up
said
he
remember
my
oath
i
shall
keep
my
word
an
inexplicable
anxiety
a
tormenting
uneasiness
came
over
him
he
had
hardly
strength
and
recollection
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
accompany
corilla
who
was
discussing
in
verse
the
question
which
rome
was
the
happiest
ancient
or
modern
carlo
s
eyes
fixed
and
motionless
rested
upon
natalie
it
fearfully
alarmed
him
not
to
be
near
her
not
to
be
able
to
watch
every
one
of
her
steps
every
one
of
her
motions
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
saw
that
savage
man
with
his
naked
dagger
lurking
near
her
and
she
was
she
not
pale
as
a
lily
seemed
she
not
in
that
white
robe
to
be
already
the
bride
of
death
i
must
hasten
to
her
i
must
protect
her
or
die
thought
he
and
with
a
threatening
glance
at
corilla
he
showed
her
the
hour
corilla
read
in
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
was
in
earnest
with
his
threat
and
as
if
her
inspiration
lent
wings
to
her
words
she
spoke
on
as
in
a
storm
of
inward
agitation
and
with
words
of
fire
she
decided
that
modern
rome
was
the
happiest
as
she
had
the
holy
father
of
christendom
her
pope
and
his
cardinals
the
applause
the
general
delight
was
now
unbounded
cardinals
were
to
be
seen
weeping
with
enthusiasm
and
joy
others
with
heartfelt
emotion
were
showering
words
of
blessing
upon
the
improvisatrice
and
all
pressed
toward
the
tribune
in
order
to
accompany
her
down
the
steps
and
in
among
the
company
a
sudden
thought
of
rescue
had
like
a
flash
of
lightning
arisen
in
carlo
s
soul
natalie
must
first
be
completely
separated
from
this
society
and
then
i
will
seek
this
man
and
render
him
incapable
of
mischief
thought
he
by
main
strength
he
made
himself
a
path
through
the
crowd
surrounding
corilla
and
now
stood
near
cardinal
bernis
at
whose
side
still
remained
natalie
and
count
paulo
you
have
struck
the
lyre
like
an
apollo
exclaimed
the
cardinal
to
the
singer
carlo
bowed
with
a
smile
and
hastily
said
and
are
you
ignorant
your
eminence
that
a
much
greater
poetess
and
improvisatrice
than
our
corilla
is
in
your
society
the
cardinal
smilingly
threatened
him
with
his
finger
poor
carlo
has
it
already
come
to
this
said
he
you
are
jealous
of
our
delight
in
corilla
and
would
lessen
her
fame
that
you
may
make
her
more
your
own
i
speak
the
truth
said
carlo
a
poetess
is
among
us
whom
the
muses
themselves
have
consecrated
an
improvisatrice
not
of
human
composition
but
by
the
grace
of
god
to
whom
the
angels
whisper
the
rhymes
and
the
muses
the
ideas
and
who
then
is
this
artist
this
consecrated
daughter
of
the
muses
wonderingly
asked
the
cardinal
carlo
indicated
natalie
and
bowed
to
the
ground
before
her
princess
tartaroff
asked
the
cardinal
with
astonishment
that
she
is
a
princess
i
know
not
said
carlo
but
i
am
quite
certain
she
is
a
poetess
what
was
it
that
at
this
moment
stirred
the
soul
of
the
young
maiden
she
now
felt
a
pride
a
blessed
joy
and
yet
she
had
previously
felt
so
sad
at
corilla
s
triumph
it
seemed
as
if
enthusiasm
raised
its
wings
in
her
as
if
the
word
the
right
word
pressed
to
her
lips
as
if
she
must
utter
in
song
her
rejoicings
and
lamentings
for
her
simultaneously
felt
pleasures
and
pains
a
pure
and
genuine
child
of
nature
she
felt
herself
the
natural
impulse
to
pour
out
in
words
tones
and
even
in
tears
what
agitated
her
soul
and
to
which
she
was
unable
to
give
a
name
cardinal
bernis
had
first
turned
imploringly
to
count
paulo
praying
for
his
permission
to
invite
the
young
princess
to
surprise
and
delight
the
company
with
some
of
her
improvisations
others
overhearing
this
mingled
in
the
conversation
and
added
their
requests
to
those
of
the
cardinal
and
the
feeling
becoming
general
the
requests
for
an
improvisation
became
universal
and
pressing
people
momentarily
forgetting
the
great
and
celebrated
improvisatrice
corilla
with
a
feverish
curiosity
turned
to
the
new
and
unknown
star
corilla
stood
almost
alone
only
cardinal
albani
remaining
by
her
side
but
his
tender
words
were
not
competent
to
appease
the
violent
storm
of
jealousy
that
raged
in
her
soul
the
solicitations
of
the
curious
romans
became
constantly
more
urgent
and
count
paulo
unable
longer
to
resist
them
finally
consented
to
leave
the
decision
to
his
ward
the
young
princess
herself
and
natalie
she
was
so
real
and
ingenuous
a
child
of
nature
that
she
felt
no
timidity
in
the
presence
of
this
crowd
she
was
so
full
of
faith
and
confidence
so
full
of
trust
and
human
love
she
thought
why
should
i
not
give
a
little
pleasure
to
these
good
people
who
approach
me
with
such
warm
sympathies
and
why
should
i
tremble
before
them
did
not
paulo
tell
me
that
i
should
feel
as
if
i
were
in
my
garden
and
it
was
only
my
trees
and
flowers
that
were
looking
at
me
with
human
faces
well
then
i
will
so
think
and
feel
and
speak
only
to
my
dear
trees
and
flowers
beckoning
carlo
with
a
charming
smile
guided
by
his
hand
she
hastily
ascended
the
steps
and
as
they
saw
her
there
upon
the
stage
this
delicate
lovely
maiden
as
they
looked
upon
her
spiritual
maiden
beauty
with
the
childlike
expression
of
her
noble
features
with
eyes
that
beamed
with
pleasure
and
inspiration
there
arose
such
a
storm
of
applause
that
natalie
slightly
trembled
and
with
a
sweet
smile
she
said
to
carlo
the
people
here
are
much
more
boisterous
than
the
zephyrs
in
our
garden
but
they
are
not
so
melodious
and
it
almost
saddens
the
heart
cardinal
bernis
now
approached
with
the
silver
vase
on
this
occasion
he
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
collect
the
themes
and
with
a
respectful
bow
he
handed
them
to
the
princess
with
a
gracious
smile
she
took
one
of
the
papers
and
unfolded
it
the
subject
was
longing
for
that
was
a
theme
well
calculated
to
inspire
natalie
and
to
reawaken
in
her
all
her
longings
sorrows
loves
and
remembrances
she
suddenly
felt
something
like
a
cold
shudder
in
her
heart
and
glancing
around
with
a
feeling
of
solitude
and
desertion
she
saw
nothing
but
curious
faces
and
strange
staring
eyes
she
also
was
repudiated
and
homeless
and
an
excessive
longing
for
the
distant
unknown
home
of
her
childhood
now
took
possession
of
her
perhaps
carlo
had
read
her
thoughts
upon
her
brow
low
and
plaintive
melodies
poured
from
his
harp
as
it
were
the
rustling
murmurs
of
remembrances
the
sighing
and
sobbing
of
a
yearning
heart
and
natalie
carried
away
by
these
tones
forgetful
of
all
around
her
mindful
only
of
the
happiness
of
her
childhood
and
of
the
lady
she
had
so
dearly
loved
began
to
sing
of
what
she
said
and
what
she
sang
she
was
unconscious
she
stood
there
as
if
elevated
by
inward
inspiration
her
eyes
flashed
as
she
stared
into
the
far
distance
and
the
images
she
saw
there
caused
her
to
smile
and
weep
at
the
same
time
all
the
glow
all
the
childlike
purity
of
her
soul
came
in
words
from
her
lips
in
a
stream
of
inspiration
of
painful
ecstasy
she
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
she
saw
not
the
ladies
weeping
with
emotion
not
the
rapturous
glances
of
the
men
she
had
entirely
forgotten
all
those
strange
unknown
people
and
when
the
constantly
increasing
storm
of
applause
finally
reminded
her
of
them
it
was
all
over
with
her
inspiration
the
words
died
upon
her
lips
and
with
a
sad
smile
she
hastened
to
the
conclusion
and
now
arose
a
shout
and
an
outbreak
of
rapture
which
caused
natalie
to
tremble
with
anxious
timidity
she
cast
a
searching
glance
around
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
paulo
must
come
to
her
relief
that
he
must
rescue
and
redeem
her
from
the
enthusiastic
and
flattering
men
who
surrounded
her
she
saw
him
not
where
was
paulo
where
was
carlo
these
inquisitive
lord
cardinals
had
formed
a
circle
around
her
she
seemed
to
herself
a
prisoner
it
alarmed
her
to
thus
find
herself
the
central
point
of
all
these
attractions
not
far
from
her
stood
corilla
with
glowing
cheeks
and
eyes
i
will
avenge
this
affront
or
die
thought
she
as
grasping
albani
s
hand
with
convulsive
violence
she
whispered
to
him
free
me
from
this
woman
and
i
will
realize
all
your
francesco
albani
smiled
then
you
are
mine
corilla
and
no
power
on
earth
shall
take
you
from
me
that
child
is
dead
see
see
how
she
makes
herself
a
path
through
the
crowd
ah
it
is
too
sultry
for
her
here
in
the
hall
she
approaches
the
garden
door
she
slips
out
ah
give
me
your
hand
corilla
yet
a
few
moments
and
the
fairest
woman
on
earth
is
mine
light
as
a
gazelle
timid
and
trembling
natalie
had
fled
the
crowd
and
now
stepping
out
into
the
garden
she
breathed
easier
it
seeming
to
her
that
she
had
escaped
a
danger
this
night
air
will
cool
and
refresh
me
and
i
shall
soon
succeed
in
finding
paulo
thought
she
constantly
wandering
farther
and
farther
into
the
garden
but
the
brightness
of
the
illuminated
alleys
annoyed
her
a
more
obscure
and
secluded
path
opening
natalie
entered
it
ah
she
needed
solitude
and
stillness
and
what
knew
she
this
simple
harmless
child
of
nature
what
knew
she
whether
it
was
proper
and
seemly
for
a
young
woman
thus
alone
to
venture
into
these
dark
walks
she
knew
not
that
she
incurred
any
risk
or
that
one
needed
protection
among
people
even
farther
resounded
the
noise
of
the
festival
the
clang
of
the
music
sounded
fainter
and
fainter
natalie
wandered
farther
and
farther
happy
because
alone
alone
what
then
was
it
that
noiselessly
and
cautiously
haunted
her
steps
following
every
movement
she
made
constantly
nearing
her
the
farther
she
found
herself
as
she
supposed
from
all
other
living
beings
what
was
it
inaudibly
creeping
through
the
bushes
even
its
dark
shadow
imperceptible
that
followed
her
like
a
ghost
it
became
stiller
and
stiller
and
nearer
crept
the
gloomy
form
that
lurked
in
her
steps
now
with
a
sudden
spring
he
rushes
upon
the
maiden
what
gleams
in
his
hand
it
is
a
dagger
he
swings
it
high
that
he
may
sink
it
deep
then
some
one
rushes
from
the
bushes
seizes
the
murderer
s
arm
wrests
the
dagger
from
his
hand
hurls
him
to
the
earth
and
a
dear
voice
cries
fly
natalie
fly
quickly
to
count
paulo
this
serpent
will
no
longer
follow
you
i
have
him
fast
the
assassin
and
carlo
broke
out
into
a
happy
and
triumphant
laugh
natalie
made
no
answer
she
was
paralyzed
with
terror
there
was
a
roaring
in
her
ears
it
darkened
before
her
eyes
and
she
fell
senseless
to
the
earth
but
her
disarmed
murderer
sought
to
free
himself
from
carlo
s
grasp
struggling
with
his
captor
he
finally
succeeded
in
half
rising
carlo
thought
not
of
his
own
danger
but
only
of
natalie
s
and
it
was
only
on
her
account
that
he
now
loudly
called
for
help
at
the
same
time
exerting
a
superhuman
strength
to
hold
on
upon
his
prisoner
voices
were
heard
lights
approached
and
paulo
s
cry
of
anguish
resounded
here
here
anxiously
cried
carlo
his
strength
already
beginning
to
fail
him
and
his
call
being
recognized
people
soon
came
with
lights
count
paulo
was
already
distinguishable
already
cardinal
bernis
with
a
light
in
his
hand
was
hastening
on
in
advance
of
the
rest
with
a
last
powerful
effort
the
prisoner
succeeded
in
freeing
himself
she
is
saved
for
this
time
but
my
dagger
will
yet
make
her
acquaintance
said
he
with
a
scornful
laugh
and
like
a
serpent
he
glided
away
among
the
bushes
she
is
saved
cried
carlo
sinking
back
toward
count
paulo
and
pointing
with
a
happy
smile
to
natalie
who
awaking
from
her
momentary
stupefaction
stretched
forth
her
arms
toward
the
count
paulo
she
whispered
low
let
us
hasten
from
here
i
dread
these
people
i
fear
them
let
us
go
but
take
him
with
us
that
they
may
not
kill
him
my
saviour
my
friend
carlo
the
departure
the
morning
dawned
count
paulo
rose
from
the
in
which
he
had
passed
the
night
he
had
occupied
the
whole
fearfully
anxious
night
in
writing
he
now
laid
the
pen
aside
and
stood
up
his
face
had
an
expression
of
firmness
and
decision
he
had
formed
a
firm
resolution
had
come
to
an
irrevocable
determination
with
a
firm
step
advancing
to
the
door
opening
into
the
adjoining
chamber
he
called
to
his
friend
cecil
the
latter
immediately
made
his
appearance
and
entering
the
count
s
chamber
laconically
said
all
is
count
paulo
smiled
sadly
you
are
then
sure
there
are
no
other
means
of
saving
her
and
ourselves
he
asked
none
whatever
said
cecil
every
moment
s
delay
increases
her
and
your
danger
the
occurrence
of
last
night
is
a
proof
of
it
they
sought
the
death
of
natalie
without
carlo
s
help
she
would
have
been
murdered
and
all
our
plans
would
have
come
to
an
her
life
is
threatened
and
yet
you
can
urge
me
to
go
and
leave
her
alone
and
unprotected
was
it
you
who
saved
her
from
the
danger
of
last
night
asked
cecil
believe
me
it
is
your
presence
that
threatens
her
with
the
most
danger
precisely
because
you
are
at
her
side
they
suspect
her
and
watch
her
every
step
the
circumstance
that
she
is
with
you
creates
distrust
and
in
natalie
they
will
think
they
see
her
whose
mysterious
flight
has
long
been
known
in
russia
and
catharine
will
have
her
tracked
in
all
countries
and
upon
all
routes
therefore
save
natalie
by
seeming
to
give
her
up
return
home
and
relate
to
them
a
fable
of
a
false
princess
by
whom
you
had
been
deceived
and
whom
you
abandoned
as
soon
as
you
discovered
the
deception
they
will
everywhere
lend
you
a
believing
ear
as
people
gladly
believe
what
they
wish
and
by
this
means
only
can
you
assure
the
future
of
natalie
and
that
is
all
just
and
true
i
myself
have
so
seen
and
recognized
it
said
the
count
and
yet
my
friend
i
nevertheless
still
waver
and
it
seems
to
me
that
an
internal
voice
warns
me
against
that
which
i
am
about
to
do
cecil
smilingly
shook
his
head
trust
not
such
voices
said
he
it
is
the
whispering
of
demons
who
envelop
themselves
in
our
own
wishes
who
entice
us
to
what
we
would
by
seeming
to
warn
us
against
what
we
fear
nothing
but
your
departure
can
give
you
safety
leave
natalie
here
in
quiet
solitude
and
without
you
she
will
be
well
concealed
in
the
solitude
of
this
garden
and
you
in
the
mean
time
will
pursue
your
affairs
in
russia
and
deceive
the
enemy
while
you
yourself
seem
to
be
the
deceived
party
they
threaten
you
with
the
confiscation
of
your
property
and
they
will
fulfil
those
threats
if
you
do
not
obey
the
call
of
the
government
go
therefore
go
we
will
secretly
sell
your
property
and
when
this
is
accomplished
then
laden
with
treasure
let
us
return
to
natalie
no
longer
fearing
their
and
when
all
this
is
done
exclaimed
count
paulo
glowing
it
shall
be
our
task
to
conduct
natalie
back
in
triumph
to
the
country
to
which
she
belongs
there
to
place
the
diadem
upon
her
fair
brows
and
to
raise
her
above
all
other
mortal
beings
god
grant
us
the
attainment
of
our
ends
sighed
cecil
we
must
and
shall
attain
them
responded
paulo
with
enthusiasm
i
must
fulfil
this
great
task
of
my
life
or
die
away
now
with
all
wavering
or
hesitation
what
must
be
shall
be
they
shall
not
say
of
the
man
who
took
compassion
upon
the
deserted
and
threatened
orphan
and
raised
her
for
his
own
egotistical
wishes
and
pusillanimously
failed
to
finish
the
work
he
began
no
no
history
shall
not
so
speak
of
me
it
shall
at
least
represent
me
as
a
brave
man
capable
of
sacrificing
his
heart
and
his
life
for
the
attainment
of
his
higher
ends
seal
these
letters
cecil
they
contain
my
last
will
and
my
bequest
to
natalie
which
i
wish
to
place
in
her
own
hands
ah
cecil
i
have
been
an
enthusiastic
fool
until
this
hour
i
thought
alas
what
did
i
not
think
and
dream
i
thought
that
all
these
plans
and
objects
were
not
worth
so
much
as
one
sole
smile
of
her
lips
and
that
if
she
would
say
to
me
i
love
thee
this
sweet
word
would
not
be
too
dearly
purchased
with
an
imperial
crown
perhaps
ah
perhaps
i
think
so
yet
but
i
will
never
more
suffer
myself
to
be
swayed
by
such
thoughts
we
must
go
natalie
s
happiness
demands
it
and
besides
she
will
not
lack
friends
and
protectors
it
was
not
without
an
object
that
i
last
evening
presented
her
to
the
most
notable
people
of
rome
not
without
an
object
that
i
consented
to
her
allowing
herself
as
a
poetess
they
now
know
her
name
which
is
repeated
with
highest
praise
in
every
quarter
of
the
city
all
rome
is
enthusiastic
in
her
praise
and
all
rome
will
protect
and
defend
her
add
to
which
i
shall
yet
recommend
her
to
the
special
protection
of
cardinal
bernis
and
it
was
exactly
in
his
house
where
she
was
almost
murdered
said
cecil
without
that
singer
carlo
she
would
have
been
forever
lost
if
then
you
would
choose
a
protector
for
her
let
it
be
count
paulo
s
brow
darkened
this
singer
loves
her
said
he
precisely
for
that
reason
smilingly
responded
cecil
one
who
loves
will
best
know
how
to
protect
count
paulo
made
no
answer
he
continued
thoughtfully
walking
back
and
forth
then
he
said
with
decision
seal
these
letters
cecil
i
will
take
them
to
natalie
you
will
then
see
her
again
asked
cecil
while
folding
the
letters
you
will
render
the
parting
more
painful
i
will
it
said
paulo
with
decision
and
taking
the
letters
he
left
the
room
with
a
firm
and
resolute
step
he
found
natalie
in
her
room
she
did
not
hear
him
coming
and
thus
did
not
turn
to
receive
him
she
was
sitting
motionless
at
the
window
and
dejectedly
looking
out
into
the
garden
her
head
supported
by
her
hand
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
had
made
a
great
change
in
her
she
now
felt
older
more
experienced
more
earnest
a
dark
shadow
had
passed
over
her
happiness
a
dark
power
had
threateningly
approached
her
the
seriousness
of
life
had
been
suddenly
unfolded
to
her
and
had
brushed
off
the
of
harmless
and
joyful
peace
from
her
childish
soul
the
happy
child
had
become
a
conscious
maiden
and
new
thoughts
new
feelings
had
sprung
up
within
her
the
first
tears
of
sorrow
had
with
a
mighty
creative
power
called
all
these
slumbering
blossoms
of
her
heart
into
existence
and
activity
and
her
unconscious
feelings
had
become
conscious
thoughts
but
what
had
not
happened
what
had
she
not
experienced
and
felt
since
last
evening
first
had
not
a
new
happiness
broken
in
upon
her
had
she
not
now
a
name
was
she
not
a
princess
then
had
she
not
achieved
a
triumph
a
triumph
in
the
presence
of
corilla
but
then
also
how
many
had
she
not
experienced
in
a
few
hours
how
had
her
heart
been
cooled
by
the
rich
flow
of
words
in
corilla
s
poesy
her
whole
soul
had
languished
for
the
acquaintance
of
a
poetess
and
she
had
heard
only
a
rhymed
work
of
art
and
then
the
last
terrible
event
why
had
they
wished
to
murder
her
who
were
her
unknown
enemies
and
why
had
she
enemies
i
should
have
been
dead
had
he
not
rescued
me
murmured
she
and
her
lovely
face
was
illuminated
by
a
sunny
smile
yes
without
carlo
i
should
have
been
lost
i
have
to
thank
him
for
my
life
oh
said
she
then
aloud
to
him
therefore
belongs
my
existence
and
for
every
joy
i
am
yet
capable
of
feeling
i
am
indebted
to
him
my
friend
carlo
ah
how
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
reward
him
for
all
this
happiness
and
while
she
was
thus
speaking
count
paulo
pale
and
silent
stood
behind
her
she
saw
him
not
and
after
a
pause
she
continued
how
strange
it
is
when
i
think
of
him
my
heart
beats
as
never
before
and
i
feel
in
it
something
like
heavenly
bliss
and
yet
at
the
same
time
like
profound
sorrow
ah
what
can
it
be
and
why
do
i
think
only
of
him
i
could
weep
because
he
does
not
yet
come
how
strange
it
all
is
and
at
the
same
time
how
sad
seems
it
not
that
i
love
carlo
more
than
any
one
else
more
even
than
paulo
who
formerly
was
the
dearest
to
me
how
is
it
now
and
am
i
then
truly
so
ungrateful
to
paulo
count
paulo
still
stood
behind
her
pale
and
silent
a
painfully
ironic
smile
flitted
over
his
face
and
he
thought
i
came
to
ask
a
question
and
natalie
has
already
given
me
the
answer
before
i
had
time
to
ask
it
perhaps
it
is
better
thus
i
have
now
nothing
to
ask
the
young
maiden
became
more
and
more
deeply
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
count
paulo
laid
his
hand
lightly
upon
her
shoulder
she
was
startled
and
involuntarily
cried
carlo
no
paulo
said
he
with
a
melancholy
smile
but
at
all
events
a
friend
natalie
though
a
friend
who
is
about
to
leave
you
you
leave
me
she
anxiously
exclaimed
that
means
only
outwardly
only
with
my
body
never
with
my
soul
said
he
deeply
moved
that
natalie
will
remain
with
you
eternally
that
will
never
leave
you
do
you
hear
never
always
remember
this
my
charming
child
my
sweet
blossom
never
entertain
a
doubt
of
me
and
if
my
voice
does
not
reach
you
if
you
receive
no
news
of
me
then
think
not
paulo
has
abandoned
me
no
then
think
only
paulo
is
dead
but
my
name
was
the
last
to
linger
upon
his
lips
and
his
last
sigh
was
for
me
you
desert
me
said
she
wringing
her
hands
what
am
i
what
shall
i
do
without
you
you
have
been
my
protector
and
my
reliance
my
teacher
and
my
friend
alas
you
were
all
to
me
and
i
have
ever
looked
up
to
you
as
my
lord
and
count
paulo
sadly
smiled
love
me
always
as
your
father
said
he
while
i
live
you
shall
never
be
an
orphan
that
i
swear
to
you
and
must
you
go
cried
she
clinging
to
him
well
then
let
me
go
with
you
you
will
be
my
father
well
i
demand
my
right
as
your
daughter
to
accompany
her
father
is
a
daughter
s
no
he
firmly
said
you
must
remain
while
i
go
but
i
go
for
you
to
assure
your
future
power
and
splendor
remember
this
princess
natalie
forget
it
not
and
when
one
day
they
brand
me
as
a
traitor
then
say
no
he
was
no
traitor
for
he
loved
me
and
now
hear
what
i
have
yet
to
say
continued
the
count
after
a
pause
while
the
still
weeping
natalie
looked
up
to
him
through
her
tears
but
look
at
me
natalie
no
not
that
sad
glance
i
can
not
bear
it
leave
me
my
and
my
courage
for
i
need
them
weep
not
and
natalie
drying
her
eyes
with
her
long
locks
sought
to
smile
i
no
longer
weep
said
she
i
listen
to
paulo
placed
two
sealed
letters
in
her
hand
swear
to
me
said
he
to
hold
these
letters
sacred
as
your
most
precious
i
swear
it
said
she
swear
to
me
to
discover
them
to
no
human
eye
to
betray
their
possession
to
no
human
ear
swear
it
to
me
by
the
memory
of
your
mother
who
now
looks
down
from
heaven
upon
you
and
receives
your
oath
then
she
is
dead
said
the
young
maiden
sadly
drooping
her
head
upon
her
breast
you
have
not
yet
sworn
said
he
the
young
maiden
raised
her
head
and
turning
her
eyes
toward
heaven
as
if
in
the
hope
of
encountering
the
tender
maternal
glance
she
solemnly
said
by
the
sacred
memory
of
my
mother
i
swear
to
discover
these
papers
to
no
human
eye
to
betray
their
existence
to
no
human
ear
but
to
hold
them
sacred
as
my
most
precious
and
mysterious
treasure
swear
further
said
count
paulo
that
whenever
a
danger
may
threaten
you
you
will
sooner
forget
all
other
things
than
these
papers
that
they
should
be
the
first
which
you
will
endeavor
to
save
yes
swear
to
me
that
you
will
ever
bear
them
upon
your
heart
and
never
permit
them
to
be
separated
from
you
i
swear
it
said
natalie
i
will
defend
the
possession
of
these
papers
if
necessary
with
my
life
and
thereby
will
you
defend
your
honor
said
paulo
for
your
honor
rests
in
these
papers
yet
ask
me
not
what
they
contain
you
must
not
yet
know
there
is
danger
in
knowing
their
contents
but
when
a
whole
year
has
passed
without
my
return
or
your
hearing
from
me
and
if
in
this
whole
year
no
messenger
comes
to
you
from
me
then
natalie
then
open
these
letters
you
will
then
possess
my
testament
and
you
will
consider
it
a
sacred
duty
to
execute
it
natalie
sobbing
said
ah
why
did
not
that
dagger
pierce
my
heart
yesterday
i
should
then
have
died
while
i
was
yet
happy
you
will
yet
do
so
said
count
paulo
with
a
slight
tincture
of
bitterness
carlo
and
your
future
yet
remain
to
you
she
looked
at
him
with
a
clear
bright
glance
but
without
answering
she
had
again
become
an
enigma
to
herself
now
when
her
friend
when
paulo
was
about
to
leave
her
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
done
wrong
to
love
another
even
for
a
moment
better
than
him
her
benefactor
and
protector
indeed
as
if
she
in
fact
loved
no
one
so
well
as
him
as
if
she
could
resign
and
leave
all
others
to
insure
paulo
s
permanent
presence
but
she
was
suddenly
startled
and
a
glowing
flush
overspread
her
cheeks
she
had
quite
accidentally
glanced
through
the
window
into
the
garden
and
had
there
discovered
carlo
as
with
slow
and
hesitating
steps
he
descended
the
alley
leading
to
the
villa
count
paulo
had
followed
her
glance
and
as
he
now
observed
the
singer
he
said
he
shall
henceforth
be
your
protector
promise
me
to
love
him
as
a
brother
will
you
he
looked
at
her
with
a
fixed
and
searching
gaze
and
she
cast
not
down
her
eyes
before
that
penetrating
and
interrogating
glance
but
met
it
directly
with
clear
and
innocent
eyes
yes
i
will
love
him
as
a
brother
she
said
one
more
thing
and
then
let
us
part
said
paulo
marianne
is
honest
and
true
let
her
never
leave
you
i
have
amply
provided
her
with
funds
for
the
necessary
expenses
for
the
next
six
months
and
i
hope
long
before
the
expiration
of
that
time
to
send
a
further
supply
if
i
do
not
then
conclude
that
i
am
dead
for
only
with
my
life
can
i
be
robbed
of
the
sweet
duty
of
caring
for
you
and
now
let
me
go
to
carlo
slightly
nodding
to
her
he
hastily
left
the
room
at
that
moment
carlo
mounted
the
steps
leading
to
the
door
of
the
villa
paulo
met
him
with
a
hearty
greeting
let
us
go
down
into
the
garden
said
he
i
have
many
things
to
say
to
the
two
men
remained
a
long
time
in
the
garden
natalie
standing
at
the
window
occasionally
saw
them
arm
in
arm
at
some
turning
of
the
walks
and
then
they
would
again
disappear
as
they
pursued
their
way
in
earnest
conversation
strange
thoughts
flitted
through
the
soul
of
the
young
maiden
and
when
she
saw
the
two
thus
wandering
arm
in
arm
she
thoughtfully
asked
herself
which
is
it
then
that
i
most
love
is
it
carlo
is
it
paulo
i
now
understand
you
perfectly
said
count
paulo
as
they
again
approached
the
house
after
a
long
and
earnest
conversation
yes
it
seems
to
me
i
know
you
as
myself
and
know
i
can
confide
in
you
you
have
perfectly
tranquillized
me
and
i
thank
you
for
your
confidence
it
was
then
corilla
that
vain
improvisatrice
who
would
have
destroyed
her
that
is
consoling
and
i
can
now
depart
with
a
lighter
heart
against
such
attacks
you
will
be
able
to
protect
i
will
protect
her
against
every
attack
responded
carlo
you
have
my
oath
that
the
secret
you
have
confided
to
me
shall
be
held
sacred
and
you
have
thereby
secured
her
from
every
outbreak
of
my
passion
she
stands
so
high
above
me
that
i
can
only
adore
her
as
my
saint
can
love
her
only
as
one
loves
the
unattainable
stars
an
honest
betrayer
at
about
the
same
time
cecil
was
hastening
through
the
streets
of
rome
often
looking
back
to
see
if
any
one
was
following
him
and
viewing
with
suspicious
eyes
every
one
he
met
he
finally
stopped
before
the
backdoor
of
a
palace
and
after
having
satisfied
himself
that
he
had
not
been
followed
he
lightly
knocked
three
times
at
the
door
upon
its
being
opened
a
grim
bearded
russian
face
presented
itself
cecil
drew
a
ring
from
his
bosom
and
showed
it
to
the
porter
quick
conduct
me
to
his
excellency
said
he
the
russian
nodded
his
recognition
of
the
token
and
beckoned
cecil
to
follow
him
after
a
short
reflection
cecil
entered
and
the
door
was
closed
guided
by
his
conductor
through
a
labyrinth
of
rooms
and
corridors
cecil
finally
succeeded
in
reaching
a
little
boudoir
whose
windows
hardly
admitted
a
ray
of
dim
twilight
the
conductor
bidding
cecil
to
wait
here
left
him
alone
in
a
few
moments
a
concealed
door
was
opened
and
a
man
of
a
tall
proud
form
entered
at
length
he
said
on
perceiving
cecil
i
had
begun
to
doubt
your
i
waited
until
i
could
bring
you
decisive
intelligence
your
excellency
said
cecil
and
you
bring
it
today
quickly
asked
the
unknown
in
an
hour
we
leave
rome
for
petersburg
uttering
a
loud
cry
of
joy
the
stranger
walked
the
room
in
visible
commotion
cecil
followed
him
with
timid
anxious
glances
and
as
he
still
kept
silence
cecil
said
your
excellency
i
have
truly
performed
what
you
required
of
me
i
have
persuaded
the
count
to
make
the
journey
notwithstanding
his
opposition
to
it
and
as
you
commanded
his
ward
remains
behind
in
rome
alone
and
ah
you
praise
your
acts
because
you
desire
your
reward
said
his
excellency
contemptuously
opening
his
and
drawing
forth
a
purse
you
there
have
your
pay
good
man
cecil
indignantly
rejected
the
money
i
am
no
judas
who
betrays
his
master
for
money
said
he
please
remember
your
excellency
for
what
i
promised
to
fulfil
your
excellency
s
commands
and
what
reward
you
promised
me
ah
i
now
remember
you
required
my
promise
that
no
harm
should
befall
the
count
only
on
that
condition
did
i
promise
my
assistance
said
cecil
when
your
emissary
sought
me
and
called
me
to
you
i
only
followed
him
as
you
well
know
most
noble
count
because
you
gave
me
to
understand
that
my
master
s
life
and
safety
were
concerned
i
came
to
you
allow
me
your
excellency
to
repeat
your
own
words
you
said
cecil
you
have
been
represented
to
me
as
a
true
friend
of
your
master
fidelity
is
so
rare
a
virtue
that
it
deserves
reward
i
will
reward
you
by
saving
your
life
quickly
leave
this
traitorous
count
and
break
off
all
connection
with
him
else
you
are
lost
i
am
secretly
sent
here
in
order
to
capture
the
count
and
his
criminal
ward
and
take
them
to
petersburg
what
there
awaits
the
count
may
easily
be
thus
speaking
your
excellency
then
showed
me
the
command
for
the
count
s
arrest
signed
by
the
empress
upon
which
i
asked
is
there
no
means
of
saving
the
count
there
is
one
said
you
persuade
the
count
to
return
immediately
to
petersburg
leaving
his
ward
behind
him
here
and
i
swear
to
you
in
the
name
of
the
empress
that
no
harm
shall
come
to
well
impatiently
cried
the
count
what
is
the
use
of
repeating
all
that
as
i
know
it
already
only
because
your
excellency
seems
to
forget
that
what
i
did
was
not
done
for
your
miserable
gold
but
for
a
totally
different
reward
the
safety
of
a
man
whom
i
love
as
my
own
you
have
my
word
no
harm
shall
come
to
i
doubt
not
your
excellency
s
word
firmly
and
decidedly
responded
cecil
your
word
is
and
when
you
let
your
commanding
voice
be
heard
all
russia
trembles
and
bows
before
you
but
here
your
voice
resounds
only
between
these
walls
and
nobody
hears
it
but
i
alone
give
me
an
evidence
of
your
word
a
signed
by
your
own
hand
for
my
master
and
then
destroy
the
order
for
his
arrest
which
you
now
hold
ah
it
seems
you
would
prescribe
conditions
said
the
count
proudly
certainly
i
will
said
cecil
i
have
complied
with
your
conditions
and
now
it
is
your
turn
sir
count
to
comply
with
mine
for
you
knew
them
before
a
dark
glow
of
anger
showed
itself
in
the
count
s
face
and
passionately
starting
up
he
approached
cecil
raising
his
arm
threateningly
against
him
sir
count
said
cecil
stepping
back
you
mistake
i
am
no
russian
serf
i
am
a
free
man
and
no
one
has
a
right
so
to
threaten
me
the
count
had
already
let
his
arm
fall
seeming
suddenly
to
have
changed
his
mind
and
in
a
more
friendly
manner
he
said
you
are
right
cecil
and
what
you
desire
shall
be
taking
a
large
sealed
paper
from
a
drawer
in
his
he
handed
it
to
cecil
that
is
the
order
for
the
arrest
destroy
it
yourself
said
he
taking
the
paper
cecil
read
it
with
attention
it
is
as
you
say
the
order
for
the
arrest
it
is
destroyed
with
a
satisfied
smile
he
tore
the
paper
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
placed
these
in
his
bosom
the
count
had
stepped
to
the
table
and
hastily
written
a
few
lines
upon
another
piece
of
paper
this
he
handed
to
cecil
i
hope
you
are
now
satisfied
said
he
cecil
took
the
paper
and
read
it
this
is
a
in
due
form
said
he
a
valid
instruction
to
all
boundary
guards
and
officials
to
let
us
pass
without
molestation
your
excellency
we
are
quits
i
complied
with
your
wish
as
you
now
have
with
mine
and
my
dear
master
is
saved
it
being
understood
that
you
start
immediately
said
the
count
the
are
already
ordered
and
we
shall
set
out
as
soon
as
i
return
home
farewell
therefore
sir
count
i
thank
you
for
enabling
me
to
save
the
man
whom
i
most
loved
i
thank
you
cecil
was
approaching
the
door
when
he
suddenly
stopped
and
his
face
took
a
sad
expression
i
have
deceived
my
dear
master
in
order
to
save
him
said
he
and
in
order
to
redeem
the
promise
i
made
to
his
father
on
his
swearing
that
i
would
watch
over
and
protect
the
son
at
the
risk
of
my
heart
s
blood
but
if
the
son
knew
what
i
have
done
he
would
call
me
a
betrayer
and
curse
me
for
he
holds
his
ward
dearer
than
his
own
life
he
leaves
the
princess
in
the
belief
that
it
is
necessary
for
her
safety
and
repairs
to
russia
to
return
with
increased
wealth
sir
count
what
is
to
become
of
natalie
that
low
and
mysteriously
replied
the
count
that
can
be
decided
only
by
the
will
of
her
who
has
sent
me
until
that
decision
no
hair
of
her
head
can
be
touched
and
the
princess
will
follow
me
to
russia
only
with
her
own
free
will
but
you
must
know
that
the
empress
hates
no
one
more
than
her
own
son
how
then
if
she
should
be
disposed
to
pass
him
over
and
select
another
as
her
successor
oh
would
to
god
that
i
rightly
understand
you
exclaimed
cecil
we
shall
one
day
perfectly
understand
each
other
said
the
count
with
a
significant
smile
now
hasten
to
redeem
your
word
and
leave
rome
with
your
master
as
soon
as
cecil
left
the
room
the
count
s
face
assumed
a
knavishly
malicious
expression
with
a
loud
laugh
he
threw
himself
upon
the
silken
divan
thus
are
all
these
good
men
real
blockheads
stupid
fools
who
believe
every
word
spoken
to
them
with
a
friendly
mien
this
honest
man
really
believes
that
his
master
is
now
saved
because
he
bears
in
his
bosom
the
fragments
of
the
order
for
his
arrest
worthy
dunce
as
if
there
were
no
duplicate
and
as
if
every
promise
were
countersigned
by
the
divinity
himself
go
home
with
your
count
my
word
shall
be
fulfilled
no
hair
of
his
head
shall
be
touched
but
his
proud
back
shall
be
curled
and
in
the
mines
of
siberia
he
may
learn
to
bow
before
a
higher
power
thus
speaking
the
count
pulled
a
bell
whose
silken
cord
hung
over
the
divan
and
as
no
one
instantly
appeared
he
pulled
it
again
this
time
more
violently
but
yet
some
minutes
passed
and
still
the
bell
was
unanswered
the
count
gnashed
his
teeth
with
rage
and
muttered
vehement
curses
at
length
the
door
opened
and
with
an
imploring
face
a
servant
appeared
upon
the
threshold
miserable
hound
where
were
you
cried
the
count
to
him
the
servant
fell
upon
his
knees
and
crept
like
a
dog
to
his
master
s
feet
excellency
we
had
as
your
grace
commanded
so
long
as
the
gentleman
was
with
you
withdrawn
from
the
anteroom
and
waited
in
the
corridor
where
the
bell
could
not
be
heard
stammered
the
servant
i
will
teach
you
wretches
to
keep
me
waiting
exclaimed
the
count
and
seizing
the
knout
that
lay
upon
the
table
before
him
he
laid
it
with
merciless
rage
upon
the
poor
servant
until
his
own
arm
sank
powerless
and
he
felt
himself
exhausted
with
fatigue
now
go
you
hound
said
he
replacing
the
knout
upon
the
table
and
the
flagellated
serf
rising
respectfully
with
his
hand
wiped
away
the
blood
which
ran
in
streams
from
his
wounds
now
go
and
send
my
officers
to
me
cried
the
count
the
servant
staggered
out
to
obey
the
command
and
soon
the
persons
thus
ordered
made
their
appearance
and
remained
standing
in
silence
at
the
door
the
count
lay
stretched
out
upon
the
divan
playing
with
the
knout
whose
leathern
thongs
were
still
dripping
with
his
servant
s
blood
let
a
courier
take
horse
immediately
and
give
him
the
order
countersigned
by
her
imperial
majesty
for
the
arrest
of
count
paulo
rasczinsky
the
courier
will
follow
him
with
it
to
the
russian
frontier
and
then
by
virtue
of
this
order
arrest
him
at
the
next
station
and
send
him
to
petersburg
in
chains
this
is
the
command
for
the
courier
he
will
answer
with
his
head
for
its
execution
one
of
the
officers
bowed
and
went
to
dispatch
the
courier
is
our
reconnoitrer
returned
asked
the
count
of
the
two
who
remained
he
what
news
brings
he
does
he
know
the
cause
of
the
murderous
attack
at
the
festival
of
the
french
cardinal
yet
why
do
i
ask
you
make
yourselves
scarce
and
let
him
come
to
speak
for
himself
the
officers
were
no
sooner
gone
than
a
bearded
churl
made
his
appearance
upon
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
greeted
the
count
with
a
grinning
laugh
what
know
you
of
the
murderous
attack
asked
the
count
in
italian
a
friend
of
mine
was
charged
with
the
affair
said
the
bravo
he
is
in
the
pay
of
the
most
holy
cardinal
albani
we
served
long
together
under
the
same
chief
and
i
know
him
intimately
he
carries
the
most
skilful
dagger
in
all
rome
and
it
is
the
greatest
wonder
that
he
missed
on
this
was
it
done
by
order
of
the
cardinal
no
the
lord
cardinal
had
lent
this
bravo
to
the
celebrated
improvisatrice
corilla
the
order
came
from
it
is
well
said
the
count

all
the

by
secret
protectors

my
arm

words

words

excellency
are
worth
four
thousand
sequins
and
these
one

easily

said
the
bandit
leaving
the
room
again
the
count
rang
and
ordered
his
private
secretary
stephano
to
be
called
stephano
said
the
count
to
him
the
first
step
is
taken
toward
the
accomplishment
of
our
object
the
work
must
succeed
i
have
pledged
my
word
for
it
to

that
alexis
orloff

failed
to
redeem
his
word
this
princess

has
no
one
to
protect
her
but
it
is
not
yet
to
be
said
that
she
is
already
yours
said
stephano
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
you
will
not
employ
force
your
excellency
you
must
have
recourse
to
stratagem
i
have
hit
upon
a
plan
of
which
i
think
you
will
approve
they
describe
this
little
princess
as
exceedingly
innocent
and
confiding
let
us
take
advantage
of
her
confiding
innocence
that
will
be
best
now
hear
my
stephano
inclined
himself
closer
to
the
ear
of
the
count
and
whispered
long
and
earnestly
it
seemed
as
if
he
feared
that
even
the
walls
might
listen
to
him
and
betray
his
plans
he
whispered
so
low
that
even
the
count
had
some
trouble
in
understanding
him
you
are
right
said
the
count
when
stephano
had
ended
your
plan
must
and
will
succeed
first
of
all
we
must
find
some
one
who
will
incline
her
in
our
favor
and
render
her
oh
for
that
we
have
our
good
russian
gold
said
stephano
laughing
and
besides
continued
the
count
our
incognito
is
at
an
end
all
rome
may
now
learn
that
i
am
here
ah
stephano
what
a
happy
time
awaits
me
this
natalie
is
beautiful
as
an
angel
god
grant
that
you
may
not
fall
in
love
with
her
sighed
stephano
you
are
always
very
generous
when
you
are
in
alexis
orloff
two
things
principally
occupied
the
romans
during
the
next
weeks
and
months
offering
them
rich
material
for
conversation
in
talking
of
these
they
had
forgotten
all
other
events
they
spoke
no
more
of
the
giant
fish
which
had
destroyed
the
friendship
of
france
and
spain
they
no
longer
entertained
each
other
with
anecdotes
in
connection
with
the
festival
of
cardinal
bernis
at
which
the
of
that
fish
upon
his
long
silver
platter
was
hailed
with
shouts
and
yes
even
that
russian
princess
who
had
momentarily
shown
herself
on
the
horizon
of
society
all
these
were
quickly
forgotten
and
people
now
interested
themselves
only
about
the
extirpation
of
the
order
of
the
jesuits
which
pope
clement
had
now
really
effected
and
of
the
arrival
of
the
russian
the
famous
alexis
orloff
whose
visit
to
rome
seemed
the
more
important
and
significant
as
they
well
knew
in
what
near
and
confidential
relations
his
brother
count
gregory
orloff
stood
with
the
empress
catharine
and
what
participation
alexis
orloff
had
in
the
sudden
death
of
the
emperor
peter
iii
the
order
of
the
jesuits
then
no
longer
existed
the
pious
fathers
of
the
order
of
jesus
were
stricken
out
of
the
book
of
history
a
word
of
power
had
annihilated
them
with
loud
complaints
and
lamentations
they
filled
the
streets
of
the
holy
city
and
if
the
prayer
of
humility
and
resignation
resounded
from
their
lips
yet
there
were
very
different
prayers
in
their
hearts
prayers
of
anger
and
rage
of
hatred
and
revenge
they
were
seen
wringing
their
hands
and
loudly
lamenting
as
they
hastened
to
their
friends
and
protectors
and
besieged
the
doors
of
the
foreign
embassies
with
them
wept
the
poor
and
suffering
people
to
whom
the
pious
fathers
had
proved
themselves
benefactors
for
since
they
knew
that
their
existence
was
threatened
they
had
assiduously
devoted
themselves
to
works
of
charity
and
mercy
and
to
strengthening
especially
in
rome
their
reputation
for
piety
benevolence
and
generosity
prodigious
sums
were
by
them
distributed
among
the
poor
more
than
five
hundred
respectable
impoverished
romans
who
had
been
accused
of
political
offences
were
secretly
supported
by
them
in
this
way
the
jesuits
against
whom
the
cry
of
denunciation
had
been
raised
for
years
in
all
europe
had
nevertheless
succeeded
at
least
in
the
holy
city
in
gaining
for
themselves
a
very
considerable
party
and
thus
securing
protection
and
support
in
the
time
of
misfortune
and
persecution
but
while
the
people
wept
with
them
and
many
cardinals
and
princes
of
the
church
secretly
pitied
them
the
ambassadors
of
the
great
european
powers
alone
remained
insensible
to
their
lamentations
no
one
of
them
opened
the
doors
of
their
palaces
to
them
no
one
afforded
them
protection
or
consolation
and
although
it
was
known
that
cardinal
bernis
in
spite
of
the
horror
which
had
for
years
been
felt
of
this
order
in
france
was
personally
favorable
to
them
and
had
long
delayed
the
consent
of
the
court
of
france
to
their
abolition
yet
even
bernis
now
avoided
any
manifestation
of
kindness
for
them
lest
his
former
friend
the
spanish
ambassador
might
think
he
so
far
humiliated
himself
as
to
favor
the
jesuits
for
the
sake
of
recovering
the
friendship
and
good
opinion
of
the
duke
of
grimaldi
but
grimaldi
himself
now
no
longer
dared
to
protect
the
jesuits
however
friendly
he
might
be
to
them
and
however
much
they
were
favored
by
elizabeth
farnese
the
spanish
king
charles
her
son
had
finally
ventured
to
defy
her
authority
and
in
an
autograph
letter
had
commanded
the
duke
of
grimaldi
to
receive
no
more
jesuits
in
his
palace
and
while
as
we
have
said
the
whole
diplomacy
had
declared
against
the
order
of
the
holy
fathers
of
jesus
it
must
have
been
the
more
striking
that
this
russian
count
orloff
had
compassion
upon
them
and
lent
a
willing
ear
to
the
complaints
of
the
unfortunate
members
of
the
order
this
russian
count
gave
the
good
romans
much
material
for
reflection
and
the
women
were
occupied
with
his
herculean
beauty
and
the
men
with
his
wild
daring
and
reckless
conduct
they
called
him
a
barbarian
a
russian
bear
but
could
not
help
being
interested
in
him
and
eagerly
repeating
the
little
anecdotes
freely
circulated
respecting
him
they
smilingly
told
that
he
had
been
the
first
who
had
had
the
courage
to
defy
the
powerful
republic
of
venice
which
for
recruiting
sailors
for
his
fleet
in
their
territories
for
the
war
against
the
turks
wished
to
banish
him
from
proud
and
beautiful
venice
but
alexis
orloff
had
laughed
at
the
senate
of
the
republic
when
they
sent
him
the
order
to
leave
he
had
ordered
the
two
hundred
soldiers
who
formed
his
retinue
to
arm
themselves
and
if
necessary
to
repel
force
with
force
but
to
the
senate
he
had
answered
that
he
would
leave
the
city
as
soon
as
he
pleased
not
before
but
as
it
seemed
that
he
was
not
pleased
to
leave
the
city
he
remained
there
and
now
the
angry
and
indignant
senate
sent
him
the
peremptory
command
to
leave
venice
with
his
soldiers
in
hours
a
deputation
of
the
senate
came
in
solemn
procession
to
communicate
to
the
russian
count
this
command
of
the
council
of
three
alexis
orloff
received
them
lying
upon
his
divan
and
to
their
solemn
address
he
laughingly
answered
i
receive
commands
from
no
one
but
my
empress
it
remains
as
before
that
i
shall
go
when
i
please
and
not
earlier
the
senators
departed
with
bitter
murmurs
and
severe
threats
count
alexis
orloff
remained
and
the
cowardly
senate
trembling
with
fear
of
this
young
russian
empire
had
silently
pocketed
the
humiliation
of
seeing
this
russian
within
their
walls
for
several
weeks
longer
this
evidence
of
the
haughty
insolence
of
count
orloff
was
related
among
the
romans
with
undisguised
pleasure
and
they
thanked
him
for
having
thus
humiliated
and
insulted
the
proud
and
imperious
republic
but
they
suspiciously
shook
their
heads
when
they
learned
that
he
seemed
disposed
to
display
his
pride
and
arrogance
in
rome
they
told
of
a
of
the
marchesa
di
paduli
which
alexis
orloff
had
attended
as
they
there
begged
of
him
to
give
some
proof
of
the
very
superior
strength
which
had
acquired
for
him
the
name
of
the
russian
hercules
he
had
taken
one
of
the
hardest
apples
from
a
silver
plateau
that
stood
upon
the
table
and
playfully
crushed
it
with
two
fingers
of
his
left
hand
but
a
fragment
of
this
hard
apple
had
hit
the
eye
of
the
duke
of
gloucester
who
was
standing
near
and
seriously
injured
it
the
sympathies
of
the
whole
company
were
excited
for
the
english
prince
and
he
was
immediately
surrounded
by
a
pitying
and
lamenting
crowd
count
orloff
alone
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
and
not
the
slightest
excuse
to
make
he
smilingly
rocked
himself
upon
his
chair
and
hummed
a
russian
popular
song
in
praise
of
his
empress
and
was
it
not
also
an
insult
for
alexis
orloff
now
to
show
himself
a
friend
to
the
jesuits
whom
the
decree
of
god
s
vicegerent
had
outlawed
and
proscribed
was
it
not
an
insult
that
he
loudly
and
publicly
promised
to
these
persecuted
jesuits
a
kind
reception
and
efficient
protection
in
russia
and
invited
them
to
found
new
communities
and
new
cloisters
there
but
alexis
orloff
cared
little
for
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
romans
he
said
to
his
confidant
stephano
there
is
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
set
at
defiance
all
the
world
and
to
oppose
all
these
things
which
the
stupid
people
would
impose
upon
us
as
laws
the
friend
and
favorite
of
the
empress
catharine
has
no
occasion
for
complying
with
such
miserable
laws
wherever
i
set
my
foot
there
the
earth
belongs
to
me
and
i
will
forcibly
maintain
my
pretensions
whenever
they
are
disputed
in
russia
i
am
the
serf
of
the
empress
in
revenge
for
which
i
will
at
least
abroad
treat
all
the
world
as
my
serfs
this
gives
me
pleasure
and
wherefore
is
the
world
here
but
to
be
enjoyed
a
little
also
for
labor
said
stephano
with
a
sly
smile
for
that
i
have
my
slaves
for
that
i
have
also
you
responded
orloff
laughing
there
is
only
one
labor
for
me
here
in
rome
and
that
is
to
create
as
much
disturbance
as
possible
in
the
city
to
set
the
people
at
odds
with
the
government
so
that
they
may
have
their
hands
full
and
find
no
time
for
observing
our
nice
game
with
our
little
princess
or
to
interfere
with
it
we
must
have
freedom
of
action
that
is
the
most
important
hence
we
must
protect
these
pious
jesuits
and
offer
support
to
the
enemies
of
this
pope
by
which
means
we
shall
ultimately
attain
our
own
ends
and
that
is
enough
for
us
we
have
not
yet
advanced
a
step
with
our
princess
natalie
said
stephano
shrugging
his
shoulders
that
it
seems
is
an
impregnable
fortress
it
must
however
yield
to
us
laughingly
responded
alexis
orloff
and
she
shall
yet
acknowledge
us
as
conquerors
we
are
undermining
stephano
and
when
the
building
crushes
her
in
its
crashing
fall
will
she
first
discover
that
she
has
long
been
in
danger
and
what
said
you
that
we
have
not
yet
advanced
a
step
and
yet
rasczinsky
is
gone
and
we
have
known
how
to
keep
cardinal
bernis
who
would
have
interested
himself
for
the
little
one
so
very
much
occupied
with
the
affair
of
the
jesuits
that
he
has
yet
had
no
time
to
think
of
the
princess
ah
these
jesuits
are
very
useful
people
we
strew
them
like
snuff
in
the
faces
of
these
diplomatists
and
while
they
are
yet
rubbing
their
weak
eyes
and
crying
out
with
pain
we
shall
quietly
draw
our
little
fish
into
our
net
and
take
her
home
without
opposition
and
if
the
fish
will
not
go
into
the
net
it
must
go
in
impatiently
cried
orloff
bah
have
i
at
the
right
time
succeeded
in
towing
our
emperor
god
bless
him
into
eternity
and
shall
i
doubt
in
the
fulness
of
time
of
enclosing
this
beautiful
child
in
my
arms
look
at
me
stephano
what
is
wanting
for
it
in
me
are
not
all
these
beautiful
women
of
rome
enraptured
with
the
russian
hercules
how
then
can
it
be
that
a
woman
of
my
own
country
can
withstand
me
the
preliminaries
are
the
main
thing
and
if
we
only
had
some
one
to
prepare
her
for
my
appearance
all
would
then
go
well
and
such
a
one
we
will
find
thanks
to
our
rubles
but
enough
of
politics
for
the
present
stephano
call
my
valet
it
is
time
for
my
toilet
and
that
is
a
very
important
corilla
corilla
was
alone
uneasy
full
of
stormy
thoughts
she
impetuously
walked
back
and
forth
occasionally
uttering
single
passionate
exclamations
then
again
thoughtfully
staring
at
vacancy
before
her
she
was
a
warm
italian
woman
that
will
neither
love
nor
hate
with
the
whole
soul
and
nourishes
both
feelings
in
her
bosom
with
equal
strength
and
with
equal
warmth
but
in
her
hatred
exhaled
as
quickly
as
love
it
was
to
her
only
the
of
life
which
she
sipped
for
the
purpose
of
a
slight
intoxication
as
in
her
intoxication
only
did
she
feel
herself
a
poetess
and
in
a
condition
for
improvisation
i
must
at
any
rate
be
in
love
said
she
else
i
should
lose
my
poetic
fame
with
cool
blood
and
a
tranquil
mind
there
is
no
improvising
and
poetizing
with
me
all
must
be
stirring
and
flaming
every
nerve
of
my
being
must
glow
and
tremble
the
blood
must
flash
like
fire
through
my
veins
and
the
most
glowing
wishes
and
ardent
longings
be
it
love
or
be
it
hate
must
be
stirring
within
me
in
order
to
poetize
successfully
and
this
can
not
be
comprehended
by
delicate
and
discreet
people
this
low
roman
populace
even
venture
to
call
me
a
coquette
only
because
i
constantly
need
a
new
glow
and
because
i
constantly
seek
new
emotions
and
new
inspirations
for
my
love
then
for
the
improvisatrice
corilla
was
nothing
more
than
a
strong
wine
with
which
she
refreshed
and
strengthened
her
fatigued
poetic
powers
for
renewed
exertions
it
was
in
a
manner
the
tow
which
she
threw
upon
the
expiring
fire
of
her
fantasy
to
make
it
flash
up
in
clear
and
bright
flames
it
was
only
in
this
way
that
she
loved
carlo
and
wept
for
him
except
that
in
this
case
her
love
had
been
of
a
longer
duration
because
it
was
who
gave
up
and
left
that
was
what
made
her
hatred
so
glowing
that
was
what
made
her
seek
the
life
of
the
woman
for
whom
carlo
had
deserted
her
this
is
a
new
situation
said
she
which
i
am
called
to
live
through
and
to
feel
but
a
poetess
must
have
experienced
all
feelings
or
she
could
not
describe
them
for
my
part
i
do
not
believe
in
the
revelations
of
genius
i
believe
only
in
experiences
one
can
describe
only
what
one
has
felt
and
experienced
whoever
may
attempt
to
describe
the
flavor
of
an
orange
must
first
have
tasted
it
that
this
attempt
to
murder
natalie
had
failed
was
to
her
a
matter
of
little
moment
she
had
experienced
the
emotion
of
it
and
just
the
same
would
it
have
been
a
matter
of
indifference
to
her
had
the
dagger
pierced
natalie
s
breast
she
was
sufficiently
a
child
of
the
south
to
consider
a
murder
as
only
a
venial
sin
for
which
the
priest
could
grant
absolution
there
was
only
one
thing
which
exclusively
occupied
corilla
following
and
tormenting
her
day
and
night
and
that
was
her
poetic
fame
she
desired
that
her
name
should
stand
high
in
the
world
glorified
by
all
europe
and
for
this
purpose
she
desired
above
all
things
to
be
crowned
as
a
poetess
in
the
capitol
of
the
holy
city
for
this
fame
she
would
willingly
have
given
many
years
of
her
life
that
was
the
aim
of
all
her
efforts
and
how
much
would
she
not
have
borne
ventured
and
suffered
for
its
attainment
how
many
intrigues
were
planned
how
much
cunning
and
dissimulation
flattery
and
hypocrisy
had
been
employed
for
that
purpose
and
all
all
as
yet
in
vain
therefore
it
was
that
corilla
now
wept
and
with
occasional
outbreaks
of
passionate
exclamations
violently
paced
her
room
her
cheeks
glowed
her
eyes
flashed
she
was
very
beautiful
in
this
state
of
excitement
that
she
must
have
acknowledged
to
herself
as
her
glance
accidentally
encountered
her
own
face
in
the
glass
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
she
remained
standing
before
the
mirror
and
almost
angrily
she
said
ah
why
am
i
now
alone
why
does
no
one
see
me
in
my
beautiful
glow
my
face
might
now
produce
some
effect
and
gain
me
friends
why
then
am
i
now
alone
but
it
seems
that
corilla
had
only
to
express
a
wish
in
order
to
see
it
suddenly
fulfilled
for
the
door
was
at
that
moment
opened
and
a
servant
announced
count
alexis
orloff
corilla
smiled
with
delight
and
let
that
smile
remain
upon
her
lips
as
she
very
well
knew
it
was
becoming
to
her
and
that
she
had
conquered
many
hearts
with
it
but
secretly
her
heart
throbbed
with
fear
and
timidly
she
asked
herself
what
can
that
russian
count
want
of
me
but
with
a
cheerful
face
she
advanced
to
receive
him
she
seemed
not
to
remark
that
a
dark
cloud
lay
upon
his
brow
and
that
his
features
bore
an
almost
threatening
expression
he
is
a
barbarian
thought
she
and
barbarians
must
be
treated
differently
from
other
men
i
must
flatter
this
lion
in
order
to
fetter
him
it
is
a
serious
matter
that
brings
me
to
you
signora
said
alexis
gloomily
a
serious
matter
she
cheerfully
asked
ah
then
i
pity
you
count
it
is
difficult
to
speak
with
me
of
serious
matters
you
rather
do
them
said
alexis
carelessly
throwing
himself
upon
a
divan
you
would
not
play
with
such
serious
things
as
for
instance
a
dagger
and
therefore
you
hurl
it
from
you
altogether
indifferent
whether
you
thereby
quite
accidentally
pierce
the
heart
of
i
do
not
understand
you
count
said
corilla
without
embarrassment
but
at
the
same
time
she
looked
at
him
with
such
a
charming
and
enticing
expression
that
alexis
involuntarily
smiled
i
will
make
myself
intelligible
to
you
said
he
in
a
milder
tone
you
must
understand
that
i
know
you
corilla
that
assassin
who
followed
the
princess
tartaroff
at
the
festival
of
cardinal
bernis
was
employed
by
you
signora
maddalena
morelli
fernandez
called
corilla
and
what
if
it
were
true
signor
alexis
orloff
called
the
handsome
northern
hercules
asked
she
roguishly
imitating
his
grave
seriousness
if
it
were
really
true
what
further
alexis
looked
in
her
face
with
an
expression
of
astonishment
you
are
wonderfully
bold
said
he
none
but
slaves
are
without
courage
responded
she
freedom
is
the
mother
of
boldness
you
do
not
then
deny
the
hiring
of
that
bravo
i
only
deny
your
right
to
inquire
said
she
i
have
a
right
to
it
he
responded
with
vehemence
this
princess
tartaroff
is
a
subject
of
the
empress
of
russia
my
mistress
who
watches
over
and
protects
all
her
subjects
with
maternal
that
good
tender
empress
exclaimed
corilla
with
an
ambiguous
smile
but
in
order
properly
to
watch
and
preserve
all
her
children
and
subjects
she
should
keep
them
in
her
own
country
take
this
princess
tartaroff
with
you
to
russia
and
then
she
will
be
safe
from
our
italian
daggers
take
her
with
you
that
will
be
the
best
way
you
then
very
heartily
hate
this
poor
little
princess
asked
alexis
laughing
yes
said
she
after
a
short
reflection
i
hate
her
and
would
you
know
why
signor
not
for
her
beauty
not
for
her
youth
but
for
her
talents
and
she
has
great
talents
ah
there
was
a
time
when
i
hated
her
although
i
knew
her
not
but
now
now
it
is
different
i
now
not
only
hate
but
fear
her
for
she
can
rival
me
not
only
in
love
but
in
fame
ah
you
should
have
seen
her
on
that
evening
she
was
like
a
swan
to
look
at
and
her
song
was
like
the
dying
strains
of
the
swan
and
all
shouted
applause
and
all
the
women
wept
indeed
i
myself
wept
not
from
emotion
but
with
rage
with
bitterness
for
they
had
forgotten
me
forgotten
for
this
new
poetess
they
overwhelmed
her
with
flatteries
leaving
me
alone
and
unnoticed
and
yet
you
ask
me
if
i
hate
her
quite
involuntarily
had
she
suffered
herself
to
be
carried
away
by
her
own
vehemence
her
inward
glowing
rage
with
secret
pleasure
count
orloff
read
in
her
features
that
this
was
no
comedy
which
she
thus
improvised
but
was
truth
and
reality
if
you
so
think
and
feel
said
he
then
we
may
soon
understand
each
other
signora
a
real
hatred
is
of
as
much
value
as
a
real
love
indeed
often
of
much
greater
one
can
more
safely
confide
in
hatred
as
it
is
more
enduring
i
will
therefore
confide
in
you
signora
if
you
will
swear
to
me
to
betray
no
word
of
what
i
shall
tell
i
swear
it
was
corilla
s
response
listen
then
this
princess
tartaroff
is
an
imposter
no
princely
blood
flows
in
her
veins
and
if
she
gives
herself
out
to
be
a
princess
it
is
because
she
therewith
connects
plans
of
more
i
need
not
say
to
you
except
that
my
illustrious
empress
has
charged
me
to
bring
this
fraudulent
princess
to
her
at
petersburg
that
she
may
there
receive
her
punishment
this
i
have
sworn
to
do
and
must
redeem
my
promise
to
transport
her
from
here
without
exciting
attention
and
without
subjecting
her
to
any
personal
injury
do
you
now
comprehend
why
i
come
i
comprehend
said
corilla
an
empress
would
avenge
herself
and
therefore
a
poor
poetess
must
forego
her
own
little
private
revenge
but
how
if
i
should
not
believe
a
word
of
this
long
story
if
i
should
consider
it
a
fable
invented
by
you
to
assure
the
safety
of
your
princess
that
you
may
be
compelled
to
believe
it
listen
further
to
and
alexis
orloff
spoke
long
and
zealously
to
her
affording
her
a
glance
into
his
most
secret
intrigues
into
his
plans
while
corilla
followed
him
with
intense
expectation
and
cheeks
i
comprehend
it
all
all
said
she
when
alexis
had
finally
ended
it
is
a
deep
and
at
the
same
time
an
infernal
plan
a
plan
which
must
excite
the
envy
and
respect
of
satan
himself
and
yourself
laughingly
asked
alexis
oh
i
said
she
i
belong
perhaps
to
the
family
of
devils
and
therefore
take
pleasure
in
aiding
you
you
need
a
negotiator
who
has
a
wide
conscience
and
an
eloquent
tongue
i
can
furnish
you
with
such
a
one
ah
that
will
make
a
droll
story
said
you
not
that
the
singer
carlo
watched
this
golden
treasure
like
a
dragon
well
it
shall
be
his
brother
who
shall
contend
with
this
dragon
his
own
brother
will
not
that
be
pleasant
count
and
are
you
sure
of
him
asked
count
orloff
how
if
his
brother
should
win
him
from
us
have
no
anxiety
this
carlo
ribas
is
so
virtuous
that
he
hates
no
one
so
much
as
his
brother
joseph
merely
because
he
passed
some
years
in
the
galleys
for
forgery
he
is
now
free
and
has
secretly
come
here
as
he
was
aware
that
i
knew
his
brother
he
came
to
beg
me
for
my
countenance
and
support
i
will
send
him
to
and
you
will
also
not
forget
my
request
that
you
will
in
all
societies
speak
of
the
great
love
which
the
empress
catharine
cherishes
for
her
near
relation
the
princess
tartaroff
i
will
not
forget
it
in
your
hands
count
i
lay
my
revenge
you
will
free
me
from
this
rival
that
will
i
said
he
with
an
inhuman
laugh
and
when
the
work
is
completed
and
you
have
faithfully
stood
by
me
then
signora
you
may
be
sure
of
the
gratitude
of
the
empress
catharine
is
the
exalted
protectress
of
the
muses
and
in
the
fulness
of
her
grace
she
will
not
forget
the
poetess
corilla
you
may
expect
an
imperial
and
i
shall
gratefully
receive
it
said
corilla
with
a
smile
a
poetess
is
always
poor
and
in
want
of
assistance
the
muses
lavish
upon
their
votaries
all
joys
but
those
of
ah
exclaimed
corilla
when
the
count
had
left
her
i
shall
in
the
end
obtain
all
i
desire
i
shall
not
only
be
crowned
with
fame
but
blessed
with
wealth
which
is
a
blessing
almost
equal
to
that
of
fame
money
has
already
founded
many
a
reputation
but
not
always
has
fame
attracted
money
to
itself
i
shall
be
rich
as
well
as
famous
that
you
already
are
exclaimed
the
cardinal
francesco
albani
who
unremarked
had
just
entered
the
room
i
am
not
said
she
with
vehemence
for
they
refuse
me
the
prize
of
fame
have
you
been
with
the
pope
your
eminence
and
what
did
he
say
i
come
directly
from
well
and
what
says
he
what
he
always
says
to
me
no
corilla
stamped
her
feet
violently
and
her
eyes
flashed
lightnings
how
beautiful
you
are
now
tenderly
remarked
the
cardinal
throwing
an
arm
around
her
she
rudely
thrust
him
back
touch
me
not
said
she
you
do
not
deserve
my
love
you
are
a
weakling
as
all
men
are
you
can
only
coo
like
a
pigeon
but
when
it
comes
to
action
then
sinks
your
arm
and
you
are
powerless
ah
the
woman
whom
you
profess
to
love
begs
of
you
a
trifling
service
the
performance
of
which
is
of
the
highest
importance
to
her
the
greatest
favor
and
you
will
not
fulfil
her
request
while
yet
swearing
you
love
her
go
you
are
a
man
and
wholly
undeserving
of
corilla
s
love
but
despairingly
exclaimed
the
cardinal
you
require
of
me
a
service
that
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
perform
ask
something
else
corilla
ask
a
human
life
and
you
shall
have
it
but
i
can
not
give
what
is
not
mine
you
demand
a
which
only
the
pope
has
the
power
to
bestow
and
he
has
sworn
that
you
shall
not
have
it
so
long
as
he
lives
will
he
then
live
eternally
cried
corilla
beside
herself
with
rage
the
cardinal
gave
her
an
astonished
and
interrogating
glance
but
his
features
suddenly
assumed
a
wild
and
malicious
expression
and
violently
grasping
corilla
s
hand
he
murmured
you
are
right
will
he
then
live
forever
bah
even
popes
are
mortal
men
and
if
we
should
choose
for
his
successor
a
man
better
disposed
toward
you
then
corilla
said
the
cardinal
interrupting
himself
and
in
spite
of
her
resistance
pressing
her
to
his
bosom
corilla
swear
once
more
to
me
that
you
will
be
mine
and
only
mine
as
soon
as
i
procure
your
coronation
in
the
capitol
swear
it
once
more
she
gave
him
such
a
sweet
enticing
and
voluptuous
smile
that
the
cardinal
trembled
with
desire
and
joy
when
you
in
the
capitol
adorn
corilla
with
the
then
will
she
willingly
lay
her
myrtle
crown
at
your
feet
said
she
with
a
charming
expression
of
maiden
modesty
the
cardinal
again
pressed
her
passionately
to
his
bosom
you
shall
have
the
and
your
myrtle
crown
is
mine
he
excitedly
exclaimed
you
will
soon
see
whether
francesco
is
a
man
farewell
corilla
and
with
a
hasty
salute
he
left
the
room
the
astonished
corilla
dismissed
him
with
a
smile
if
it
is
to
succeed
at
all
it
can
be
only
through
him
said
she
poor
francesco
he
will
bring
me
a
full
and
what
can
i
give
him
in
return
an
exfoliated
myrtle
crown
that
is
all
no
heart
with
it
the
holy
chafferers
cardinal
francesco
albani
meantime
hastened
through
the
streets
with
the
sprightliness
of
youth
he
noticed
neither
the
respectful
salutations
and
of
those
he
passed
nor
their
visible
shuddering
and
alarm
when
under
the
cardinal
s
hat
they
recognized
the
fierce
and
inhuman
francesco
albani
he
stopped
before
the
palace
of
cardinal
juan
angelo
braschi
the
equipage
of
the
new
cardinal
was
drawn
up
before
his
door
ah
gleefully
remarked
albani
he
is
therefore
yet
at
home
and
i
shall
meet
with
him
hastily
entering
the
palace
and
pushing
past
the
servant
who
would
have
preceded
him
he
entered
the
cardinal
s
cabinet
unannounced
be
not
troubled
your
eminence
said
albani
with
a
smile
i
will
not
detain
you
long
i
know
your
habits
and
know
that
signora
malveda
usually
expects
you
at
this
hour
because
cardinal
rezzonico
is
not
then
with
her
but
i
have
something
important
to
say
to
you
you
know
i
am
a
man
who
without
forms
and
circumlocutions
always
comes
directly
to
the
point
i
do
so
now
you
desire
to
be
the
successor
of
ganganelli
braschi
turned
pale
and
timidly
cast
down
his
eyes
why
are
you
shocked
cried
albani
every
cardinal
hopes
and
wishes
to
become
the
father
of
christendom
that
is
natural
i
should
also
wish
it
for
myself
but
i
know
that
that
can
not
be
i
have
permitted
these
lord
cardinals
who
in
the
conclave
invoke
the
holy
spirit
to
look
too
much
into
my
cards
i
was
not
so
prudent
as
you
braschi
and
therefore
you
are
much
the
more
likely
to
become
god
s
vicegerent
would
you
not
like
to
be
pope
if
ganganelli
should
happen
to
die
and
how
high
would
you
hold
my
voice
how
much
would
it
be
worth
to
you
more
than
all
i
possess
infinitely
more
said
the
shrewd
braschi
were
i
sure
of
your
voice
i
might
then
have
a
definite
hope
of
becoming
pope
for
your
voice
carries
many
others
with
it
how
then
can
you
expect
me
to
estimate
what
is
inestimable
would
you
give
me
twenty
thousand
asked
albani
threefold
that
sum
if
i
possessed
it
but
i
have
nothing
i
am
a
very
poor
cardinal
as
you
well
know
my
whole
property
consists
of
six
thousand
scudi
and
that
trifling
sum
i
dare
not
offer
borrow
then
of
signora
malveda
said
albani
cardinal
rezzonico
is
rich
and
liberal
let
us
speak
directly
to
the
point
you
would
be
pope
and
i
am
willing
to
forward
your
views
how
much
will
you
pay
if
signora
malveda
will
lend
me
four
thousand
scudi
i
should
then
have
ten
thousand
to
offer
you
well
so
be
it
ten
thousand
scudi
will
do
if
you
will
add
to
it
a
trifling
name
it
said
braschi
you
know
that
ganganelli
opposes
the
crowning
of
our
famous
improvisatrice
corilla
in
the
capitol
this
is
an
injustice
which
ganganelli
s
successor
will
have
to
repair
will
you
do
it
braschi
gave
the
cardinal
a
sly
glance
ah
said
he
signora
corilla
seems
to
be
less
liberal
than
signora
malveda
she
will
allow
you
no
discount
of
her
future
is
it
not
so
i
know
nothing
worse
than
an
ambitious
woman
listen
albani
it
seems
that
we
must
be
mutually
useful
to
each
other
i
need
your
voice
to
become
pope
and
you
need
mine
to
become
a
favored
lover
very
well
give
me
your
voice
and
in
return
i
promise
you
a
for
signora
corilla
and
eight
thousand
scudi
for
yourself
ah
you
would
haggle
contemptuously
exclaimed
albani
you
would
be
a
very
niggardly
vicegerent
of
god
but
as
corilla
is
well
worth
two
thousand
scudi
i
am
content
give
me
eight
thousand
scudi
and
the
promise
to
crown
corilla
as
soon
as
i
am
pope
i
will
do
both
my
sacred
word
for
it
shall
i
strengthen
my
promise
by
swearing
upon
the
bible
cardinal
albani
gave
the
questioner
a
glance
of
astonishment
and
then
broke
out
with
a
loud
and
scornful
laugh
you
forget
that
you
are
speaking
to
one
of
your
kind
of
what
use
would
such
a
holy
farce
be
to
us
who
have
no
faith
in
its
binding
power
no
no
we
priests
know
each
other
such
buffoonery
amounts
to
nothing
one
written
word
is
worth
a
thousand
sworn
oaths
let
us
have
a
contract
prepared
that
is
better
we
will
both
sign
it
just
as
you
please
said
braschi
with
a
smile
stepping
to
his
writing
desk
and
rapidly
throwing
some
lines
upon
paper
which
he
signed
after
it
had
been
carefully
read
by
albani
at
length
the
business
is
finished
said
albani
now
cardinal
braschi
go
to
your
signora
and
surprise
her
with
the
news
that
she
holds
in
her
arms
a
pope
pope
clement
will
soon
need
a
successor
he
must
be
very
ill
the
poor
pope
so
speaking
he
took
leave
of
the
future
pope
with
a
friendly
nod
and
departed
with
as
much
haste
as
he
had
come
and
now
to
these
pious
jesuit
fathers
said
he
stepping
out
upon
the
grass
it
was
very
prudent
in
me
that
i
went
on
foot
to
corilla
our
cursed
equipages
betray
every
thing
they
are
the
greatest
chatterboxes
how
astonished
these
good
romans
would
be
to
see
a
cardinal
s
carriage
before
these
houses
of
the
condemned
no
no
strengthen
yourselves
for
another
effort
my
reverend
legs
only
yet
this
walk
and
then
you
will
have
and
the
cardinal
trudged
stoutly
on
until
he
reached
the
jesuit
college
there
he
stopped
and
looked
cautiously
around
him
this
unfortunate
saintly
dress
is
also
a
hindrance
murmured
he
like
the
sign
over
the
it
proclaims
to
all
the
world
i
am
a
cardinal
here
indulgences
dispensations
and
god
s
blessings
are
to
be
sold
who
will
buy
who
will
buy
i
dare
not
now
enter
this
scouted
and
repudiated
sacred
house
i
might
be
remarked
suspected
and
betrayed
corilla
dear
beautiful
woman
it
costs
me
much
pains
and
many
efforts
to
conquer
you
will
your
possession
repay
me
the
cardinal
patiently
waited
in
the
shadow
of
a
until
the
street
become
for
a
moment
empty
and
solitary
then
he
hastened
to
a
of
the
building
and
sure
of
being
unobserved
entered
a
deep
and
quiet
silence
pervaded
these
long
and
deserted
it
seemed
as
if
a
lay
upon
the
whole
building
as
if
it
were
depopulated
desolated
nowhere
the
least
trace
of
that
busy
stirring
life
usually
prevailing
in
these
corridors
no
longer
those
bands
of
scholars
that
formerly
peopled
these
passages
the
doors
of
the
great
open
the
benches
unoccupied
the
lecturer
s
chair
from
which
the
pious
fathers
formerly
with
such
subtle
wisdom
explained
and
defended
their
dangerous
doctrines
these
also
are
desolate
the
reign
of
the
jesuits
was
over
ganganelli
had
thrust
them
from
the
throne
and
they
cursed
him
as
their
murderer
he
had
suppressed
their
sacred
order
he
had
commanded
them
to
lay
aside
their
peculiar
costume
and
adopt
that
of
other
monkish
orders
or
the
usual
dress
of
abbes
but
from
their
property
he
had
not
been
able
to
expel
them
in
this
college
within
their
cloisters
his
power
had
not
been
able
to
penetrate
there
they
remained
what
they
had
been
the
holy
fathers
of
jesus
the
pious
defenders
of
craft
and
christian
deception
the
cunning
advocates
of
regicide
the
proud
servants
of
the
only
church
there
with
rage
in
their
hearts
they
meditated
plans
of
vengeance
against
this
criminal
pope
who
had
condemned
them
to
a
living
death
who
like
a
wicked
magician
had
changed
their
sacred
college
into
an
open
grave
he
had
killed
them
and
he
should
he
nevertheless
live
with
these
fatal
questions
did
the
holy
fathers
occupy
themselves
reflecting
upon
them
in
their
gloomy
leisure
and
in
low
whisperings
consulting
with
their
prior
and
in
such
secret
consultation
did
cardinal
francesco
albani
find
the
prior
with
his
confidant
in
the
refectorium
do
not
let
me
disturb
you
he
said
laughing
i
see
by
your
faces
you
are
engaged
in
conversation
upon
the
subject
in
which
i
yesterday
took
a
part
that
is
very
well
we
can
resume
it
where
we
yesterday
broke
off
and
again
knot
the
threads
which
i
yesterday
so
violently
rent
with
which
knot
shall
we
begin
the
eyes
of
the
pious
jesuit
father
flashed
with
joy
francesco
albani
was
inclined
to
favor
their
plans
and
wishes
they
saw
that
in
his
cunning
smile
in
his
return
to
them
we
were
speaking
of
the
sacred
and
important
duty
you
will
have
to
perform
your
eminence
said
the
prior
with
a
winning
smile
ah
yes
i
remember
said
the
cardinal
with
apparent
indifference
we
spoke
of
the
s
communion
of
his
holiness
the
and
of
the
fact
that
you
your
eminence
would
have
to
discharge
the
important
duty
of
pouring
the
sacred
wine
into
the
golden
chalice
of
the
vicegerent
of
god
said
the
prior
yes
yes
i
now
remember
it
all
said
albani
with
a
smile
you
spoke
to
me
of
a
wonderful
flask
of
wine
which
by
means
of
the
golden
tube
you
would
gladly
help
to
the
honor
of
being
drunk
by
his
holiness
from
the
communion
it
is
so
precious
a
wine
that
only
the
vicegerent
of
god
is
worthy
of
wetting
his
lips
with
it
it
must
touch
the
lips
of
no
other
mortal
i
know
such
a
wine
said
albani
it
thrives
best
in
the
region
of
naples
and
whoever
drinks
of
it
becomes
a
partaker
of
eternal
the
celebrated
poison
is
prepared
only
in
naples
yes
you
are
right
it
is
a
wonderfully
strengthening
wine
said
the
prior
folding
his
hands
and
directing
his
eyes
toward
the
heavens
we
thank
god
that
he
has
left
us
in
possession
of
so
precious
an
essence
the
pope
they
say
is
suffering
and
needs
strengthening
see
how
closely
we
follow
the
teaching
of
him
whose
name
we
bear
and
who
has
commanded
love
your
enemies
bless
those
who
curse
you
instead
of
avenging
ourselves
we
would
be
his
benefactors
and
refresh
him
with
the
most
precious
of
what
we
possess
and
you
would
be
so
unselfish
as
to
keep
from
him
all
knowledge
of
your
benevolence
you
would
bless
him
quite
secretly
but
how
if
i
should
betray
you
and
communicate
your
precious
secret
to
his
holiness
the
pope
yes
yes
i
shall
open
my
mouth
and
speak
unless
i
am
prevented
by
a
golden
lock
put
upon
my
we
shall
willingly
apply
such
a
lock
said
the
pleased
prior
but
that
it
may
entirely
close
my
mouth
the
lock
will
need
to
be
very
heavy
responded
albani
with
a
laugh
it
is
so
it
weighs
six
thousand
scudi
said
the
prior
that
is
much
too
light
exclaimed
albani
laughing
it
will
hardly
cover
my
mouth
it
still
remains
that
i
am
to
undertake
a
very
hazardous
affair
reflect
if
any
one
should
discover
my
possession
of
this
strange
wine
if
ganganelli
should
perceive
that
it
is
not
wine
from
his
own
cellar
that
i
have
poured
into
the
cup
for
him
it
is
dangerous
work
that
you
would
assign
to
me
a
work
for
which
i
might
lose
my
head
and
you
venture
to
offer
me
a
poor
six
thousand
scudi
for
it
adieu
then
pious
fathers
keep
you
your
golden
lock
and
i
my
unclosed
lips
i
shall
know
when
and
where
to
speak
and
the
cardinal
moved
toward
the
door
hastening
after
him
the
prior
handed
him
a
small
flask
the
contents
of
which
were
clear
and
pure
as
crystal
water
timidly
and
anxiously
whispering
ten
drops
of
this
in
ganganelli
s
communion
wine
and
ten
thousand
scudi
are
yours
give
the
ten
thousand
scudi
at
once
said
albani
with
decision
and
the
drops
the
pope
s
wine
is
too
strong
i
will
reduce
it
a
little
with
this
pure
the
poison
is
pure
and
clear
as
water
without
taste
or
smell
it
is
prepared
from
opium
and
spanish
flies
combined
with
some
other
ingredients
which
however
are
only
known
to
the
makers
of
it
that
the
is
made
from
the
foam
sometimes
found
upon
the
lips
of
the
dying
is
an
idle
tale
allessandro
borgia
was
the
first
to
bring
it
into
use
sic
transit
gloria
mundi
on
the
following
day
there
was
a
solemn
high
office
in
peter
s
all
rome
flocked
there
to
see
this
great
and
touching
spectacle
a
dense
crowd
thronged
the
streets
and
all
shouted
and
cried
when
the
pope
surrounded
by
his
swiss
guard
appeared
in
their
midst
in
his
gilded
armchair
and
received
the
greetings
of
the
people
with
a
bland
smile
toward
peter
s
waved
the
human
throng
and
to
peter
s
the
pope
was
borne
the
features
of
ganganelli
had
an
expression
of
sadness
and
as
he
now
glanced
down
upon
the
thousands
of
his
subjects
who
shouting
followed
him
he
asked
in
his
heart
who
among
you
will
be
my
murderers
and
how
long
will
you
yet
allow
me
to
live
ah
were
i
yet
the
poor
franciscan
monk
i
was
then
no
one
would
take
the
pains
to
assassinate
me
why
then
does
the
world
precisely
now
seem
so
fair
to
me
now
when
i
know
that
i
must
leave
it
so
soon
and
the
pope
shed
a
secret
tear
while
surrounded
by
royal
splendor
he
imparted
his
blessing
to
the
thousands
who
reverently
knelt
at
his
feet
the
bells
rang
the
organ
resounded
the
wide
halls
of
peter
s
were
penetrated
by
the
marvellous
singing
of
the
sistine
chapel
thousands
and
thousands
of
wax
tapers
lighted
the
noble
space
of
the
church
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
pressed
into
the
sacred
halls
under
his
canopy
opposite
the
high
altar
sat
the
vicegerent
of
god
upon
his
golden
throne
surrounded
by
the
consecrated
cardinals
and
bishops
protected
by
the
swiss
guard
who
could
have
ventured
to
attack
the
holy
father
who
would
have
been
so
foolhardy
as
to
attempt
to
penetrate
that
thick
wall
of
swiss
guards
and
princes
of
the
church
who
could
have
been
successful
in
such
an
attempt
no
human
being
but
where
the
people
could
not
penetrate
where
there
was
no
room
for
the
swinging
of
a
dagger
there
the
malignant
poison
lurked
unseen
ganganelli
sat
upon
his
golden
throne
intoxicated
by
the
clang
of
the
organ
and
charmed
by
the
singing
of
the
high
choir
and
the
pope
looking
down
upon
the
human
crowd
again
asked
himself
who
among
you
are
my
murderers
the
singing
ceased
the
organ
was
silent
and
only
the
solemn
tones
of
all
the
bells
of
peter
s
resounded
through
the
church
a
stillness
else
the
people
lay
upon
their
knees
and
crossed
themselves
before
the
altar
kneeling
priests
murmured
prayers
it
was
a
solemn
a
sublime
moment
for
the
pope
must
now
receive
the
communion
the
vicegerent
of
god
must
drink
the
blood
of
the
lamb
but
still
the
pope
remains
sacred
he
can
not
like
other
mortals
make
use
of
his
earthly
feet
he
must
not
like
them
approach
the
altar
sitting
upon
his
throne
he
has
partaken
of
the
holy
wafer
and
as
it
was
unbecoming
his
dignity
to
descend
to
the
altar
in
order
to
come
to
christ
the
latter
must
decide
to
come
to
him
the
golden
chalice
at
the
high
altar
contains
the
blood
of
the
lamb
the
cardinal
francesco
albani
performs
the
holy
office
he
has
the
blessed
host
and
under
his
consecrated
hand
will
now
be
effected
the
miracle
of
turning
the
wine
into
the
blood
of
christ
and
cardinal
albani
lays
the
golden
tube
in
the
cup
and
another
cardinal
passes
the
other
end
of
the
tube
to
the
pope
through
this
sacred
tube
will
he
sip
the
consecrated
wine
the
blood
of
the
redeemer
rushing
and
thundering
recommences
the
high
office
the
trumpets
renew
their
blasts
the
drums
roll
the
bells
ring
the
organ
rattles
its
song
of
jubilee
the
trombones
crash
in
unison
it
is
the
greatest
most
sublime
moment
of
the
whole
ceremony
the
pope
having
put
the
golden
tube
to
his
lips
sips
the
wine
changed
into
blood
while
the
pope
drinks
the
two
cardinals
who
are
on
service
approach
the
sacred
throne
they
hold
a
torch
in
the
right
hand
and
a
small
bundle
of
tow
in
the
left
and
according
to
the
custom
set
the
tow
on
fire
it
flashes
up
in
a
bright
flame
is
soon
extinguished
and
a
small
almost
imperceptible
quantity
of
ashes
floats
from
it
to
the
feet
of
the
pope
transit
gloria
mundi
so
passes
the
glory
of
the
world
exclaimed
francesco
albani
with
proud
presumptuousness
and
with
maliciously
scornful
glances
while
with
an
expression
of
savage
triumph
he
stares
in
the
paling
face
of
the
pope
transit
gloria
mundi
repeated
albani
in
a
yet
louder
and
more
thundering
voice
the
bells
ring
the
hymn
resounds
the
trombone
and
organ
clang
the
audience
are
on
their
knees
in
prayer
a
bustle
arises
a
suppressed
murmur
the
holy
father
of
christendom
has
fainted
upon
his
throne
like
any
common
mortal
man
the
vapo
since
paulo
had
left
her
and
she
found
herself
alone
natalie
felt
sad
solitary
in
the
paradise
that
surrounded
her
no
longer
did
she
sing
in
emulation
of
the
birds
no
longer
did
she
hop
with
youthful
delight
and
the
impetuosity
of
a
young
roe
through
the
charming
alleys
sadly
and
with
downcast
eyes
sat
she
under
the
myrtle
bush
by
the
murmuring
fountains
and
frequent
heavy
sighs
heaved
her
laboring
breast
all
is
changed
all
she
often
thoughtfully
said
to
herself
a
great
and
terrible
secret
has
been
unveiled
within
me
the
secret
of
my
utter
abandonment
i
have
no
one
on
earth
to
whom
i
belong
once
i
never
thought
of
that
paulo
was
all
to
me
my
friend
my
father
my
brother
but
paulo
has
abandoned
me
i
belong
not
to
him
and
hence
i
could
not
go
with
him
and
who
is
left
to
me
carlo
she
answered
herself
in
a
low
tone
and
with
a
melancholy
smile
but
carlo
has
not
filled
the
void
that
paulo
s
absence
has
left
in
my
heart
at
first
i
thought
he
could
but
that
was
only
a
short
deception
carlo
is
good
and
kind
always
devoted
always
ready
to
serve
me
he
always
conforms
himself
to
my
will
is
all
subjection
all
obedience
but
that
is
terrible
unbearable
exclaimed
the
almost
weeping
young
maiden
who
then
shall
i
obey
before
whom
shall
i
tremble
when
all
obey
me
and
tremble
before
me
and
yet
carlo
is
a
man
no
said
she
quite
low
were
he
so
i
should
then
obey
him
and
not
he
me
then
would
he
give
me
commands
and
not
i
him
no
carlo
is
no
man
paulo
was
so
where
art
thou
my
friend
my
father
and
the
young
maiden
yearningly
spread
her
arms
in
the
air
calling
upon
her
distant
friend
with
tender
words
and
heartfelt
longings
but
the
days
slowly
passed
and
still
no
news
came
from
him
natalie
dreamily
and
sadly
sank
deeper
into
herself
her
cheeks
paled
her
step
became
less
light
and
elastic
in
vain
did
her
true
friends
marianne
and
carlo
exhaust
themselves
in
projects
and
propositions
for
her
distraction
and
amusement
you
should
go
into
the
world
and
amuse
yourself
in
society
princess
said
carlo
i
hate
the
world
and
society
said
natalie
people
are
all
bad
and
i
abominate
them
what
had
i
done
to
these
people
how
had
i
offended
them
even
in
thought
and
yet
they
would
have
murdered
me
the
very
first
time
i
appeared
among
them
no
no
leave
me
here
in
my
solitude
where
i
at
least
have
not
to
tremble
for
my
life
where
i
have
carlo
to
guard
and
protect
the
singer
pressed
the
proffered
hand
to
his
lips
then
let
us
at
least
make
some
excursions
in
the
environs
of
rome
said
he
no
said
she
i
should
everywhere
long
to
be
back
in
my
garden
nowhere
is
it
so
beautiful
as
here
leave
me
my
paradise
why
would
you
drive
me
from
it
alas
despairingly
exclaimed
carlo
you
call
yourself
happy
and
satisfied
why
then
are
you
so
sad
am
i
sad
she
asked
with
surprise
no
carlo
i
am
not
sad
i
sometimes
dream
nothing
more
let
me
yet
dream
you
will
die
thought
carlo
and
with
an
effort
he
forced
back
the
cry
of
despair
that
pressed
to
his
lips
but
his
cheeks
paled
and
his
whole
form
trembled
seeing
it
natalie
shook
off
her
apathy
and
with
a
lively
sympathy
and
tender
friendship
she
inquired
the
cause
of
his
disquiet
she
was
so
near
him
that
her
breath
fanned
his
cheek
and
her
locks
touched
his
brow
ah
you
would
kill
me
you
would
craze
me
murmured
he
sorrowfully
sinking
down
powerless
at
her
feet
she
looked
wonderingly
at
him
why
are
you
angry
with
me
she
innocently
said
and
what
have
i
done
that
you
so
wrongfully
accuse
me
what
have
you
done
cried
he
beside
himself
the
moment
had
overcome
him
this
moment
had
burst
the
bands
with
which
he
had
bound
his
heart
and
in
unfettered
freedom
in
glowing
passion
his
secret
forced
its
way
to
his
lips
he
must
at
length
for
once
speak
of
his
sorrows
even
if
death
should
follow
he
must
give
expression
to
his
torment
and
his
love
even
should
natalie
banish
him
forever
from
her
presence
what
have
you
done
repeated
he
ah
she
does
not
even
know
that
she
is
slowly
murdering
me
she
does
not
even
know
that
i
love
her
am
i
not
to
know
she
reproachfully
asked
would
you
indeed
have
saved
my
life
had
you
not
loved
me
carlo
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
my
life
and
you
say
i
murder
you
yes
he
frowardly
exclaimed
you
murder
me
slowly
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
am
i
consumed
by
this
frightful
internal
fire
that
is
destroying
me
ah
you
know
not
that
you
are
killing
me
and
have
you
not
destroyed
my
youthful
strength
and
from
a
man
converted
me
into
an
old
trembling
and
complaining
woman
is
it
not
for
your
sake
that
i
have
fled
the
world
leaving
behind
me
all
it
offered
of
fame
and
wealth
and
honor
is
it
not
your
fault
that
i
have
ceased
to
be
a
free
man
to
have
a
will
of
my
own
and
have
become
a
slave
crawling
at
your
feet
ah
woe
is
me
that
i
ever
came
to
know
you
you
are
an
enchantress
you
have
made
me
your
hound
and
whining
i
lie
in
the
dust
before
you
satisfied
when
you
touch
me
with
your
at
first
natalie
had
listened
to
him
with
terror
and
astonishment
then
an
expression
of
noble
pride
was
to
be
read
upon
her
features
a
glowing
flush
flitted
over
her
delicate
cheeks
and
with
flashing
eyes
and
a
heaving
bosom
she
sprang
up
from
her
seat
proud
as
a
queen
she
rose
erect
the
blood
of
her
ancestors
awoke
in
her
she
at
this
moment
felt
herself
free
as
an
empress
as
proud
as
secure
and
stretching
her
arm
toward
the
outlet
of
the
garden
she
said
in
a
determined
tone
go
signor
carlo
leave
me
i
tell
you
we
have
no
longer
any
thing
in
common
with
each
other
carlo
seemed
as
if
awakened
from
a
delirium
breathless
with
eyes
trembling
and
anxious
he
stared
at
the
angry
maiden
he
knew
nothing
of
what
he
had
said
he
comprehended
not
her
anger
only
his
infinite
suffering
he
was
conscious
only
of
his
secret
love
and
grasping
natalie
s
hands
with
an
imploring
expression
he
constrained
the
young
maiden
almost
against
her
will
to
remain
and
reseat
herself
upon
the
grassy
bank
before
which
he
knelt
as
he
looked
up
to
her
with
those
glowing
passionate
glances
a
maiden
fear
and
trembling
for
the
first
time
came
over
her
an
anxiety
and
timidity
inexplicable
to
herself
her
delicate
transparent
cheeks
paled
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
folding
her
hands
with
a
childishly
supplicating
expression
she
said
in
a
low
tremulous
tone
my
god
my
god
have
mercy
upon
me
i
am
a
wholly
abandoned
solitary
orphan
rescue
me
yet
from
this
trouble
and
distress
from
this
terrible
loneliness
fear
nothing
my
charming
angel
whispered
carlo
i
will
be
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
patient
very
patient
in
my
sorrow
i
have
sworn
it
and
will
keep
my
oath
but
you
must
hear
me
you
must
only
this
one
time
allow
me
to
express
in
words
my
love
and
my
sorrow
my
misery
and
my
ecstasy
will
you
allow
me
this
my
lily
my
beautiful
swan
he
would
have
again
grasped
her
hand
but
she
withdrew
it
with
a
proud
angry
glance
speak
on
said
she
wearily
leaning
her
hand
against
the
speak
on
i
will
listen
to
you
and
he
spoke
to
her
of
his
love
he
informed
her
of
his
former
life
his
poverty
his
want
his
connection
with
corilla
whom
he
had
quitted
in
order
to
devote
himself
wholly
to
her
to
obey
serve
and
worship
her
all
his
life
and
if
necessary
to
die
for
her
but
you
he
despairingly
said
you
know
not
love
your
heart
is
cold
for
earthly
love
like
the
angels
in
heaven
you
love
only
the
good
and
the
sublime
you
love
mankind
collectively
but
not
the
individual
ah
natalie
you
have
the
heart
of
an
angel
but
not
the
heart
of
a
woman
the
young
maiden
had
half
dreamingly
listened
to
him
her
hand
leaned
back
and
her
glance
directed
toward
the
heavens
she
now
smiled
and
with
an
inimitable
grace
laying
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
said
in
a
very
low
tone
and
yet
i
feel
that
a
woman
s
heart
is
beating
there
but
it
sleeps
who
will
one
day
come
to
awaken
it
carlo
did
not
understand
these
low
whispered
words
he
understood
only
his
own
passion
his
own
consuming
glow
and
anew
he
commenced
his
described
to
her
the
torments
and
fierce
joys
of
an
unreturned
love
which
is
yet
too
strong
and
overpowering
to
be
suppressed
and
natalie
listened
to
him
with
a
dreamy
thoughtfulness
his
words
sounded
in
her
ears
like
a
wonderful
song
from
a
strange
distant
world
which
she
knew
not
but
the
description
of
which
filled
her
heart
with
a
sweet
longing
and
she
could
have
wept
without
knowing
whether
it
was
for
sorrow
or
joy
thus
natalie
at
length
said
carlo
entirely
exhausted
and
pale
with
emotion
thus
i
love
you
you
must
sometime
have
learned
it
and
have
known
that
even
angels
can
not
mingle
with
mortals
unloved
and
unpunished
i
should
finally
have
been
compelled
to
tell
you
that
you
might
torture
no
longer
in
cruel
ignorance
that
you
learning
to
understand
your
own
heart
might
tell
me
whether
i
have
to
hope
or
only
to
fear
poor
carlo
murmured
natalie
you
love
me
but
i
do
not
love
you
this
has
even
now
become
clear
to
me
and
while
you
have
so
glowingly
described
the
passion
i
have
for
the
first
time
comprehended
that
i
yet
know
nothing
of
that
love
and
that
i
can
never
learn
it
of
you
this
is
a
misfortune
carlo
but
as
we
can
not
change
we
must
submit
to
carlo
drooped
his
head
and
sighed
he
had
no
answer
to
make
and
only
murmuringly
repeated
her
words
yes
we
must
submit
to
it
and
why
can
we
not
she
almost
cheerfully
asked
with
that
childlike
innocence
which
never
once
comprehended
the
sorrow
she
was
preparing
for
carlo
why
can
we
not
joyfully
submit
we
both
love
only
in
a
different
manner
let
each
preserve
and
persevere
in
his
own
manner
and
then
all
may
yet
be
well
and
it
shall
be
well
exclaimed
carlo
with
animation
you
can
not
love
me
as
i
love
you
but
i
can
devote
my
whole
life
to
you
and
that
will
i
do
at
home
in
my
charming
naples
a
beautiful
custom
is
prevalent
when
one
loves
he
is
adopted
as
a
a
protector
who
follows
the
steps
of
the
one
he
loves
who
watches
before
her
door
when
she
sleeps
who
secretly
lurks
at
a
distance
behind
her
when
she
leaves
her
house
who
observes
every
in
order
to
preserve
her
from
every
murderous
or
other
inimical
attack
or
in
case
of
need
to
hasten
to
her
assistance
such
a
protects
her
against
the
jealousy
of
her
husband
or
the
vengeance
of
a
dismissed
lover
natalie
as
i
can
not
be
your
lover
i
will
be
your
will
you
accept
my
services
giving
him
her
hand
she
smilingly
said
i
carlo
pressed
that
hand
to
his
lips
and
bedewed
it
with
a
warm
tear
well
then
i
swear
myself
your
said
he
with
deep
emotion
wherever
you
may
be
i
shall
be
near
you
i
shall
always
follow
to
warn
and
to
protect
you
should
you
be
in
danger
call
me
and
you
will
find
me
at
your
side
whether
by
night
or
by
day
i
shall
always
watch
over
you
and
sleep
at
the
threshold
of
your
door
and
should
a
dream
alarm
you
i
shall
be
there
to
tranquillize
you
so
long
as
i
live
natalie
so
long
as
your
has
a
dagger
and
a
sure
hand
so
long
shall
misfortune
fail
to
penetrate
into
your
dwelling
you
can
not
be
mine
or
return
my
love
but
i
can
care
for
you
and
watch
over
you
in
accepting
me
for
your
you
have
given
me
the
right
to
die
for
you
if
necessary
and
that
of
itself
is
a
happiness
thus
speaking
carlo
rose
and
no
longer
able
to
conceal
his
deep
emotion
and
suppress
his
tears
he
left
natalie
and
hastened
into
the
obscurest
alleys
of
the
garden
the
young
maiden
watched
his
retreat
with
a
sad
smile
poor
carlo
murmured
she
and
ah
yet
much
poorer
natalie
he
loves
at
least
but
i
am
i
not
much
more
to
be
pitied
i
have
no
one
whom
i
love
i
am
entirely
isolated
and
of
what
use
is
a
solitary
paradise
the
invasion
corilla
had
kept
her
word
she
had
sent
to
alexis
orloff
carlo
s
brother
joseph
ribas
the
and
with
a
malicious
smile
she
had
said
to
the
latter
you
will
avenge
me
on
your
treacherous
brother
count
orloff
warmly
welcomed
corilla
s
if
you
give
me
satisfaction
said
he
you
may
expect
a
royal
recompense
and
the
favor
of
the
exalted
empress
of
russia
first
of
all
tell
me
what
you
can
do
not
much
said
joseph
ribas
laughing
and
the
little
i
can
will
yet
be
condemned
as
too
much
i
can
very
dexterously
wield
the
dagger
and
reach
the
heart
through
the
back
because
i
did
that
to
a
successful
rival
at
palermo
i
was
compelled
by
the
police
to
flee
to
naples
there
a
good
friend
taught
me
how
to
make
counterfeit
money
an
art
which
i
brought
to
some
perfection
and
which
i
successfully
practised
for
some
years
but
the
police
thinking
my
skill
too
great
finally
relieved
me
from
my
employment
and
gave
me
free
board
and
lodging
for
ten
years
in
the
galley
ah
that
was
a
happy
time
your
excellency
i
learned
much
in
the
galleys
and
something
which
i
can
now
turn
to
account
in
your
service
i
learned
to
speak
the
russian
language
like
a
native
of
moscow
such
a
one
was
for
seven
years
my
inseparable
friend
and
and
as
he
was
too
stupid
or
too
lazy
to
learn
my
language
i
was
forced
to
learn
his
that
i
might
be
able
to
converse
with
him
a
little
that
your
excellency
is
about
all
i
know
to
wield
the
dagger
make
counterfeit
money
speak
the
russian
language
and
some
other
trifling
tricks
which
however
may
be
of
service
to
your
who
knows
said
orloff
laughing
do
you
understand
for
example
how
to
break
into
a
house
and
steal
gold
and
diamonds
without
being
caught
in
the
act
that
said
joseph
thoughtfully
i
should
hope
to
be
able
to
accomplish
i
have
indeed
as
yet
had
no
experience
in
that
line
but
in
the
galleys
i
have
listened
to
the
soundest
instructions
and
heard
the
experiences
of
the
greatest
master
of
that
art
with
the
curiosity
of
an
emulous
student
orloff
laughed
you
are
a
sly
fellow
said
he
and
please
me
much
if
you
act
as
well
as
you
talk
we
shall
soon
be
good
friends
well
night
you
make
your
first
essay
the
business
is
an
and
that
shall
be
my
masterpiece
responded
joseph
ribas
if
you
succeed
i
will
in
the
name
of
my
illustrious
empress
immediately
take
you
into
her
service
and
you
become
an
officer
of
the
russian
joseph
ribas
stared
at
him
with
astonishment
that
is
certainly
an
immense
honor
and
a
great
good
fortune
said
he
only
i
should
like
to
know
if
the
russian
marine
engages
in
and
if
the
officers
are
obliged
to
stand
under
fire
yes
indeed
cried
orloff
laughing
but
in
such
cases
you
can
conceal
yourself
behind
the
cannon
until
the
fight
is
over
i
shall
remember
your
wise
suggestion
in
time
of
need
seriously
responded
joseph
ribas
bowing
to
the
count
and
where
your
excellency
is
to
be
the
scene
of
my
present
activity
where
am
i
to
gain
my
epaulets
and
in
fact
ribas
did
remember
it
at
a
later
period
having
become
a
russian
admiral
he
was
intrusted
with
the
command
of
the
flotilla
which
was
to
descend
the
danube
to
aid
in
the
capture
of
kilia
and
ismail
but
during
the
investment
of
ismail
december
ribas
concealed
himself
among
the
reeds
on
the
bank
of
the
danube
and
did
not
reappear
until
the
danger
was
over
and
he
could
in
safety
share
in
the
booty
taken
by
his
sailors
but
this
cowardice
and
avarice
of
their
admiral
very
nearly
caused
a
mutiny
among
the
sailors
it
was
not
suppressed
without
the
greatest
efforts
i
will
myself
conduct
you
to
the
spot
and
show
you
the
house
where
a
rich
set
of
diamonds
and
some
thousands
of
scudi
are
lying
in
company
with
your
epaulets
and
as
i
have
rather
long
fingers
i
shall
be
able
to
grasp
both
the
epaulets
and
the
treasure
laughingly
responded
ribas
it
was
in
the
evening
after
this
conversation
of
orloff
with
joseph
ribas
a
wonderfully
brilliant
evening
such
as
is
known
only
under
italian
skies
natalie
inhaled
the
soft
air
with
delight
and
drank
in
the
intoxicating
odor
of
the
flowers
which
poured
out
their
sweetest
fragrance
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
she
was
on
this
evening
unusually
cheerful
with
the
smiling
brow
and
childish
gayety
as
in
happier
days
she
skipped
down
the
alleys
or
with
her
guitar
upon
her
arm
reposed
upon
her
favorite
seat
under
the
near
the
murmuring
fountains
i
am
so
happy
ah
so
happy
said
she
in
consequence
of
having
dreamed
of
paulo
in
my
dream
he
was
near
me
spoke
to
me
and
that
is
a
sure
sign
of
his
speedy
return
oh
certainly
certainly
in
my
dream
he
announced
it
to
me
and
i
distinctly
heard
him
say
we
shall
meet
again
natalie
i
shall
soon
be
with
you
ah
may
this
dream
but
prove
true
sighed
marianne
natalie
s
faithful
companion
she
was
standing
not
far
from
her
mistress
with
carlo
and
both
were
tenderly
observing
the
young
maiden
who
now
smilingly
grasped
her
guitar
and
commenced
a
song
of
joy
for
paulo
s
expected
return
i
have
no
faith
in
our
count
s
return
whispered
marianne
while
natalie
was
singing
it
is
a
bad
sign
that
no
news
not
a
line
nor
even
the
shortest
message
had
yet
come
from
him
something
unusual
some
great
and
uncontrollable
misfortune
must
have
prevented
his
writing
you
do
not
think
they
have
imprisoned
him
asked
carlo
i
fear
it
sighed
marianne
and
if
so
what
fate
then
awaits
our
poor
princess
helpless
alone
without
means
for
if
the
count
is
imprisoned
he
will
no
longer
be
in
a
condition
to
send
money
as
he
promised
and
we
now
possess
only
a
thousand
scudi
with
double
that
amount
in
diamonds
then
we
are
still
rich
enough
to
keep
off
deprivations
for
a
time
said
carlo
but
when
at
length
these
last
resources
are
exhausted
asked
marianne
when
we
no
longer
have
either
money
or
diamonds
how
then
oh
then
exclaimed
carlo
with
a
beaming
face
then
will
we
labor
for
her
that
also
will
be
a
pleasure
marianne
while
the
two
were
thus
conversing
natalie
with
a
happy
smile
and
cheerful
face
was
still
singing
her
hymn
of
joy
for
paulo
s
approaching
return
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
rustling
trees
the
murmuring
fountains
and
the
chirping
birds
in
the
it
was
a
beautiful
night
and
as
the
bright
full
moon
now
advanced
between
the
pines
illuminating
natalie
s
face
and
form
the
partially
intoxicated
and
perfectly
happy
carlo
whispered
only
look
marianne
does
she
not
resemble
a
blessed
angel
ready
to
spread
her
wings
and
with
the
moonlight
to
mount
up
to
the
stars
only
look
seems
it
not
as
if
the
moonbeams
tenderly
embraced
her
for
the
purpose
of
leading
an
angel
back
to
its
home
may
she
at
least
one
day
with
such
a
happy
smile
take
her
departure
for
the
skies
sighed
marianne
piously
folding
her
hands
at
this
moment
a
shrill
cutting
wail
interrupted
natalie
s
song
a
string
of
her
guitar
had
suddenly
snapped
asunder
frightened
almost
angry
natalie
let
the
instrument
fall
to
the
earth
and
again
the
strings
resounded
like
lamentations
and
sighs
that
is
a
bad
omen
sighed
natalie
how
if
that
should
be
true
and
not
my
dream
and
trembling
with
anxiety
the
young
maiden
stretched
forth
her
hands
toward
her
friends
carlo
marianne
she
anxiously
said
come
here
to
me
protect
me
with
your
love
from
this
mortal
fear
and
anguish
which
has
suddenly
come
over
me
see
the
moon
is
hiding
behind
the
clouds
ah
the
whole
world
grows
dark
and
casts
a
mourning
veil
over
its
bright
face
and
the
timid
child
clinging
to
marianne
s
arm
concealed
her
face
in
the
bosom
of
her
motherly
friend
and
you
call
that
an
omen
said
carlo
with
forced
cheerfulness
this
time
princess
i
am
the
which
has
alarmed
you
it
is
my
own
fault
that
this
string
broke
it
was
already
injured
and
half
broken
this
evening
when
i
tuned
the
guitar
but
i
hoped
it
would
suffice
for
the
low
sad
melodies
you
now
always
play
yes
could
i
have
known
that
you
would
have
so
exulted
and
shouted
i
should
have
replaced
it
with
another
string
and
this
great
misfortune
would
not
have
while
speaking
he
had
again
attached
the
string
and
drawn
it
tight
the
defective
string
is
quickly
repaired
and
you
can
recommence
your
hymn
of
joy
he
said
handing
back
the
guitar
to
natalie
she
sadly
shook
her
head
it
is
passed
said
she
i
can
exult
and
sing
no
more
and
have
an
aversion
to
this
garden
see
how
black
and
threatening
these
pines
rise
up
and
do
not
these
resemble
large
dark
graves
no
no
it
frightens
me
here
i
can
no
longer
remain
among
these
graves
and
these
watchers
of
the
dead
come
let
us
go
to
our
rooms
it
is
night
we
will
sleep
and
dream
come
let
us
immediately
go
into
the
and
like
a
frightened
roe
she
fled
toward
the
house
the
others
following
her
in
an
hour
all
was
silent
in
the
villa
the
lights
were
successively
extinguished
in
natalie
s
and
marianne
s
chambers
only
in
carlo
s
little
chamber
yet
burned
a
dull
solitary
lamp
and
occasionally
the
shadow
of
the
uneasy
singer
passed
the
window
as
he
restlessly
walked
his
room
at
length
however
this
lamp
also
was
distinguished
and
all
was
dark
and
still
about
this
time
a
dark
shadow
was
seen
creeping
slowly
and
cautiously
through
the
garden
soon
it
stood
still
and
then
one
might
have
supposed
it
to
be
a
deception
and
that
only
the
wind
shaking
the
pines
had
caused
that
moving
shadow
but
suddenly
it
again
appeared
in
a
moonlighted
place
where
no
bush
or
tree
threw
its
shade
and
as
if
alarmed
by
the
brightness
it
then
again
moved
aside
into
the
bushes
this
shadow
came
constantly
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
house
and
as
the
walks
were
here
broader
and
lighter
one
might
distinctly
discern
that
it
was
a
human
being
the
form
of
a
tall
stately
man
that
so
cautiously
and
stealthily
approached
the
house
and
what
is
that
sparkling
and
flashing
in
his
girdle
is
it
not
a
dagger
together
with
a
pistol
and
a
long
knife
ah
a
threatening
armed
man
is
approaching
this
silent
solitary
house
and
no
one
sees
no
one
hears
him
even
the
two
large
hounds
which
with
remarkable
watchfulness
patrol
the
garden
during
the
night
even
they
are
silent
ah
where
then
are
they
carlo
had
himself
unchained
them
that
they
might
wander
freely
where
then
can
they
be
they
lie
in
the
bushes
far
from
the
house
cold
stiff
and
lifeless
before
them
lies
a
piece
of
seductively
smelling
meat
that
was
what
had
enticed
them
to
forget
their
duty
and
instead
of
growling
and
barking
they
had
with
snuffling
noses
been
licking
this
tempting
flesh
their
instinct
had
not
told
them
it
was
poisoned
and
therefore
they
now
lay
stiff
and
cold
near
the
food
that
had
destroyed
them
no
from
those
hounds
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
this
bold
audacious
man
the
hounds
will
no
more
betray
him
nor
warningly
announce
that
joseph
ribas
the
venturesome
thief
and
is
lurking
about
the
house
to
steal
or
murder
as
the
case
may
be
he
has
now
reached
the
house
he
listens
for
a
moment
and
as
all
remains
still
no
suspicious
noise
making
itself
heard
with
paper
brought
with
him
for
the
purpose
he
presses
in
one
of
the
window
panes
then
passing
his
hand
through
the
vacancy
caused
by
the
absent
pane
of
glass
he
opens
one
wing
of
the
french
window
and
by
a
bold
leap
springing
upon
the
parapet
he
lets
himself
glide
slowly
down
into
the
room
again
all
is
still
and
silent
lies
the
solitary
peaceful
villa
suddenly
appears
a
small
but
bright
light
behind
one
of
these
dark
windows
that
is
the
thief
s
lantern
which
joseph
ribas
has
lighted
to
illuminate
his
dark
criminal
way
he
cautiously
ascends
the
stairs
leading
to
the
second
story
and
not
a
step
jars
under
his
feet
not
one
nor
does
the
slightest
noise
betray
him
he
is
now
above
in
the
long
corridor
approaching
the
first
door
he
listens
long
he
hears
a
loud
breathing
some
one
sleeps
within
with
one
sole
quick
movement
he
turns
the
key
remaining
in
the
lock
the
door
is
now
locked
and
the
sleeper
within
remains
undisturbed
joseph
creeps
along
to
the
next
door
and
again
he
listens
to
ascertain
if
there
be
anything
stirring
within
but
no
he
hears
nothing
all
is
still
behind
the
door
he
draws
a
pistol
from
his
girdle
cocks
it
and
thus
prepared
to
resist
every
attack
he
suddenly
opens
the
door
no
one
is
in
the
room
no
one
but
joseph
ribas
the
thief
who
with
flashing
eyes
suspiciously
and
carefully
examines
every
hole
and
corner
but
no
no
one
is
there
calm
and
sure
joseph
ribas
steps
into
the
room
drawing
and
bolting
the
door
behind
him
no
one
can
now
surprise
him
no
one
can
fall
upon
him
from
behind
but
yes
there
is
also
a
door
on
each
side
right
and
left
he
listens
at
the
first
he
thinks
he
hears
a
light
breathing
here
also
he
quickly
shoves
a
bolt
and
passes
over
to
the
other
door
which
stands
ajar
cautiously
he
pushes
it
open
and
looks
in
a
small
dull
lamp
is
burning
there
lighting
the
lovely
face
of
the
sleeping
princess
natalie
that
is
she
low
murmured
ribas
as
with
eager
glances
he
observes
the
young
and
charming
maiden
he
is
drawn
forward
as
if
with
invisible
bands
he
penetrates
into
this
sacred
asylum
of
the
slumbering
maiden
but
he
forcibly
checks
his
advance
i
have
sworn
not
to
touch
her
and
i
will
keep
my
word
that
i
may
secure
my
epaulets
he
muttered
to
himself
and
retreating
into
the
first
chamber
he
bolts
the
door
to
make
all
sure
that
leads
into
natalie
s
chamber
now
to
the
work
said
he
with
decision
here
stands
the
bureau
the
treasure
must
be
and
placing
his
dark
lantern
upon
a
table
he
draws
forth
his
picklock
and
chisels
and
commences
breaking
open
the
bureau
right
this
thievish
instinct
has
not
deceived
him
he
has
found
all
all
here
is
the
little
box
of
sparkling
diamonds
and
here
the
full
purses
of
money
with
a
knavish
smile
joseph
ribas
conceals
the
brilliants
in
his
bosom
and
deposits
the
money
in
his
capacious
pockets
it
is
a
pity
that
this
is
not
mine
he
muttered
with
a
grin
but
toward
this
count
i
must
act
as
an
honorable
thief
and
i
have
promised
to
bring
it
all
truly
to
the
work
is
completed
the
malicious
criminal
act
is
performed
he
can
now
go
can
again
creep
away
from
the
house
his
feet
have
soiled
why
does
he
not
why
does
he
linger
in
these
rooms
why
directs
he
such
wild
and
eager
glances
to
the
door
behind
which
natalie
sleeps
he
can
not
withstand
the
temptation
and
even
at
the
risk
of
awaking
natalie
he
must
see
her
once
more
and
moreover
what
had
he
to
fear
from
an
isolated
young
girl
he
will
only
have
one
more
look
at
her
nothing
more
he
noiselessly
pushes
back
the
bolt
noiselessly
upon
tiptoe
with
closed
lantern
he
creeps
into
the
room
and
to
natalie
s
bedside
she
is
wonderfully
beautiful
and
she
smiles
in
her
slumber
how
charming
is
that
placid
face
that
shoulder
that
arm
thrown
up
over
her
head
where
it
is
half
concealed
under
her
luxuriant
locks
wonderfully
beautiful
is
she
dares
he
to
touch
that
arm
and
breathe
a
kiss
a
very
light
kiss
upon
those
fragrant
lips
why
not
no
one
sees
him
nor
will
count
alexis
orloff
ever
know
that
his
commands
have
been
disobeyed
but
as
he
bent
down
as
his
breath
comes
only
in
light
contact
with
her
cheek
she
stirs
maiden
modesty
never
slumbers
it
watches
over
the
sleeping
girl
it
protects
her
it
is
her
good
genius
who
never
deserts
her
drawing
herself
up
natalie
opens
her
eyes
and
starts
up
from
her
couch
then
she
sees
a
large
threatening
masculine
form
close
before
her
close
before
her
that
face
a
shriek
of
terror
and
anguish
bursts
from
her
lips
and
in
a
tone
of
alarm
she
calls
carlo
carlo
help
help
carlo
save
more
she
did
not
say
with
a
wild
rage
angry
and
ashamed
of
his
own
folly
joseph
ribas
rushes
upon
her
one
more
cry
he
threateningly
said
one
more
call
for
help
and
i
will
murder
you
but
at
this
moment
a
small
curtained
door
which
ribas
had
not
remarked
and
hence
not
fastened
was
suddenly
opened
and
carlo
rushed
in
i
am
here
natalie
i
am
here
rushing
upon
the
stranger
and
grasping
him
with
gigantic
strength
he
thrust
him
down
from
the
bed
joseph
ribas
turned
toward
his
new
and
unexpected
enemy
the
lamp
lighted
his
face
and
falling
back
carlo
shrieked
my
brother
joseph
ribas
broke
out
into
a
loud
savage
laugh
at
length
we
meet
my
brother
said
he
but
this
time
you
shall
not
hinder
me
in
my
work
this
time
i
am
the
conqueror
no
no
that
you
are
not
cried
carlo
beside
himself
with
pain
and
rage
confess
what
you
want
in
this
house
confess
or
you
are
a
dead
man
and
with
a
drawn
dagger
he
rushed
upon
his
opponent
a
frightful
struggle
ensued
natalie
in
her
pale
as
a
lily
knelt
upon
her
bed
and
prayed
she
had
folded
her
hands
over
her
breast
directly
over
the
place
where
the
papers
confided
to
her
by
paulo
in
a
little
silken
bag
always
hung
suspended
by
a
golden
chain
grant
o
my
god
prayed
she
grant
that
i
may
keep
my
promise
to
paulo
and
that
i
may
defend
these
papers
with
my
life
and
the
two
brothers
were
still
struggling
and
contending
like
two
serpents
they
had
coiled
around
each
other
and
held
each
other
in
their
toils
flee
flee
natalie
groaned
carlo
with
a
weakened
voice
flee
away
from
here
i
yet
hold
him
you
are
yet
safe
flee
but
in
this
moment
the
maiden
thought
not
of
her
own
danger
she
thought
only
of
carlo
springing
from
her
bed
with
flashing
eyes
she
boldly
threw
herself
between
the
contending
men
no
no
said
she
courageously
i
will
not
flee
i
shall
at
least
know
how
to
die
a
shriek
resounded
from
carlo
s
lips
his
arms
relaxed
and
fell
from
his
enemy
leaving
his
brother
free
ah
finally
finally
gasped
the
panting
joseph
that
was
an
amusing
carnival
farce
my
virtuous
brother
farewell
i
am
this
time
triumphant
with
a
wild
leap
he
sprang
to
the
door
brandishing
his
bloody
dagger
in
his
right
hand
he
ran
through
the
corridor
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
garden
saved
said
he
breathing
more
freely
i
think
this
russian
will
be
satisfied
with
me
i
bring
the
money
and
the
diamonds
and
at
the
same
time
have
effectually
opened
a
vein
for
this
troublesome
protector
ah
it
seems
to
me
i
have
very
successfully
put
in
practice
my
studies
in
the
of
the
galleys
and
humming
a
jovial
song
joseph
ribas
swung
himself
into
a
tree
close
to
the
wall
and
let
himself
down
on
the
other
side
above
in
natalie
s
chamber
carlo
long
lay
stretched
on
the
floor
pale
with
the
in
his
throat
in
a
bright
stream
flowed
the
blood
from
the
wound
made
by
his
brother
s
dagger
natalie
knelt
by
him
no
tear
was
in
her
eye
no
lamentation
escaped
her
lips
she
seemed
perfectly
calm
and
collected
in
her
excess
of
sorrow
she
only
sought
with
her
robe
and
her
hair
to
cover
carlo
s
wound
and
stop
the
flow
of
blood
a
happy
smile
played
upon
carlo
s
blue
lips
i
die
he
murmured
but
i
die
for
thee
thy
has
kept
his
word
he
has
defended
thee
until
his
last
breath
how
good
is
god
he
lets
me
die
in
thy
service
no
no
you
must
not
die
cried
natalie
her
calmness
giving
way
to
the
wildest
sorrow
no
carlo
you
must
live
oh
say
not
that
you
die
ah
you
love
me
and
yet
you
would
leave
me
alone
only
live
and
i
also
will
love
you
carlo
as
warmly
and
as
glowingly
as
you
love
me
do
but
remain
with
me
and
my
heart
my
life
shall
be
yours
too
late
too
late
murmured
carlo
with
dying
lips
remember
me
natalie
i
have
dearly
loved
you
i
die
happy
for
i
die
in
your
arms
no
no
you
shall
live
in
my
arms
sobbed
she
i
will
be
yours
your
bride
kiss
me
my
bride
he
falteringly
stammered
she
bent
over
him
and
with
hers
she
touched
his
lips
already
stiffening
in
death
she
laid
her
warm
glowing
cheek
to
his
cold
and
face
that
full
fresh
life
pressed
that
which
was
cold
and
expiring
to
her
bosom
in
an
ardent
struggle
with
death
in
vain
death
is
inexorable
what
he
has
once
touched
with
his
hand
that
is
past
recovery
it
is
his
the
blood
no
longer
flowed
from
carlo
s
wound
the
breath
no
longer
rattled
in
his
throat
it
was
silent
but
a
blessed
smile
still
lay
upon
his
lips
with
this
smile
had
he
died
happy
blessed
in
the
embrace
of
her
he
had
so
truly
loved
when
marianne
after
long
and
vain
efforts
to
open
the
door
had
finally
managed
by
tying
her
together
to
let
herself
down
into
the
garden
and
had
thence
hastened
into
the
house
and
up
into
natalie
s
chamber
she
found
there
all
silent
and
still
nothing
stirred
natalie
lay
in
a
deathlike
swoon
he
carlo
already
stiffened
in
death
and
she
the
senseless
natalie
with
her
head
reclining
against
the
marble
face
of
her
friend
poor
natalie
why
must
marianne
succeed
in
awakening
thee
from
thy
swoon
why
did
you
not
let
her
continue
in
her
insensibility
marianne
in
sleep
she
at
least
would
not
have
realized
that
she
was
now
left
entirely
alone
entirely
abandoned
with
no
one
to
defend
her
against
her
cruel
and
artful
enemies
of
whose
existence
she
never
once
dreamed
intrigues
count
orloff
lay
in
a
comfortable
careless
position
upon
his
divan
leisurely
smoking
his
long
turkish
pipe
before
him
stood
joseph
ribas
laughingly
relating
in
his
own
comic
manner
the
occurrences
of
the
preceding
night
you
are
a
wonderful
man
said
orloff
when
joseph
had
finished
you
have
honestly
earned
your
epaulets
and
you
will
for
the
first
time
appear
at
my
as
a
russian
officer
ah
i
prophesy
a
great
future
for
you
you
have
the
requisite
skill
and
address
to
make
your
fortune
you
are
shrewd
daring
and
you
recoil
from
no
means
finding
them
all
good
and
useful
when
they
forward
your
aims
with
such
principles
one
may
go
far
in
this
world
and
russia
in
fact
offers
you
the
best
opportunity
for
bringing
all
these
fine
talents
into
and
moreover
i
commenced
my
russian
career
with
a
good
omen
said
joseph
i
have
placed
a
murder
at
the
head
of
my
russian
deeds
that
is
a
promising
commencement
is
it
not
sir
count
you
must
know
that
better
than
any
indeed
yes
i
must
best
know
that
said
the
count
laughing
and
continually
stroking
his
long
black
beard
by
a
fair
and
murder
one
can
always
make
his
fortune
in
russia
a
and
murder
is
with
us
often
rewarded
with
a
barony
and
the
title
of
count
indeed
sometimes
with
the
highest
and
tenderest
imperial
favor
and
grace
ah
a
murder
at
the
right
moment
is
an
excellent
thing
only
one
must
be
quite
sure
of
himself
and
not
fail
of
hitting
the
right
man
an
unsuccessful
murder
is
a
very
bad
and
indeed
a
very
dangerous
thing
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
one
and
never
have
had
any
thing
to
do
with
one
whatever
i
have
undertaken
i
have
always
boldly
and
successfully
accomplished
the
good
emperor
peter
iii
knew
that
and
consequently
trembled
when
i
with
passeb
and
bariatinsky
entered
his
chamber
the
good
emperor
he
did
not
tremble
long
it
was
soon
finished
yes
yes
that
was
a
deed
done
at
the
right
time
and
therefore
has
the
great
catharine
been
so
grateful
to
us
and
honoured
us
above
all
the
illustrious
grandees
of
her
of
the
tragic
and
horrible
events
connected
with
catharine
s
accession
to
the
throne
and
of
the
strangulation
of
peter
in
which
he
took
so
active
a
part
orloff
spoke
in
rome
with
the
greatest
freedom
and
evident
pleasure
my
little
opening
murder
has
indeed
less
significance
sighed
joseph
ribas
what
was
it
but
to
help
a
humble
musician
to
the
blessedness
and
harmony
of
the
spheres
but
that
musician
was
your
brother
ribas
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
is
he
was
so
considered
but
in
reality
i
believe
he
was
only
a
my
mother
of
blessed
memory
had
many
little
adventures
and
i
think
carlo
s
birth
was
somewhat
connected
with
them
nor
am
i
sure
that
it
was
not
a
necessary
work
to
kill
him
as
it
was
surely
my
duty
to
avenge
my
father
s
injured
honor
which
is
all
i
have
done
upon
these
grounds
has
a
good
honest
priest
this
day
given
me
absolution
and
i
now
stand
before
you
pure
and
sinless
as
a
maiden
we
can
therefore
begin
anew
your
excellency
have
you
still
any
commands
for
me
you
now
have
a
very
noble
and
sublime
part
to
play
said
orloff
laughing
you
must
now
appear
as
the
benefactor
of
our
russian
princess
and
as
the
mediating
forerunner
of
my
own
person
that
will
be
indeed
a
charming
role
said
ribas
rubbing
his
hands
with
delight
i
shall
admirably
acquit
myself
as
benefactor
and
mediator
but
give
me
some
details
sir
count
you
shall
have
them
said
orloff
from
the
mouth
of
stephano
the
person
called
immediately
appeared
at
the
door
of
a
stephano
said
orloff
now
to
work
friend
the
courier
who
arrived
has
brought
us
good
news
and
full
powers
count
paul
rasczinsky
is
sent
to
siberia
for
his
property
is
confiscated
and
falls
to
the
state
i
have
an
unlimited
power
signed
by
the
empress
herself
to
seize
and
sell
his
possessions
here
in
the
name
of
the
empress
take
with
you
some
attorney
and
officers
and
go
to
his
villa
but
first
of
all
help
our
little
joseph
ribas
to
his
uniform
and
epaulets
that
he
may
be
properly
costumed
for
a
rescuer
and
benefactor
and
now
away
with
you
instruct
him
well
stephano
ah
i
should
like
to
be
present
at
this
delightful
comedy
and
count
orloff
broke
out
into
a
hearty
laugh
this
whole
affair
is
very
entertaining
and
romantic
he
said
to
himself
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
i
am
truly
very
thankful
to
catharine
for
intrusting
it
to
me
i
love
the
adventurous
and
romantic
indeed
whom
else
could
she
have
chosen
for
this
business
i
should
like
to
know
who
would
dare
to
enter
the
lists
with
me
the
russian
hercules
and
who
would
be
so
bold
as
to
contend
with
me
for
this
prize
thus
speaking
he
rose
from
the
divan
and
stepped
to
the
great
venetian
mirror
before
which
he
long
remained
attentively
viewing
himself
ahem
this
tender
empress
catharine
knows
how
to
judge
of
manly
beauty
murmured
he
with
a
smile
and
i
can
not
blame
her
for
so
often
giving
me
the
preference
over
my
brother
gregory
besides
i
shall
first
appear
before
this
little
princess
natalie
in
my
antique
dress
catharine
has
often
told
me
i
was
enchanting
in
my
antique
costume
well
we
will
also
let
this
enchantment
work
a
little
here
but
first
we
must
think
of
what
is
nearest
to
us
this
corilla
has
rendered
us
a
service
and
we
must
be
grateful
they
say
she
loves
diamonds
i
shall
therefore
send
her
these
diamonds
which
her
joseph
ribas
last
night
made
the
property
of
the
russian
crown
and
with
them
i
will
send
a
little
billet
written
with
my
own
hand
who
knows
but
that
this
will
give
her
more
pleasure
than
the
sparkling
brilliants
in
that
however
the
handsome
count
orloff
was
mistaken
the
poetess
corilla
therein
resembled
to
a
hair
the
and
heroines
of
the
stage
of
the
present
day
she
attached
a
great
value
to
diamonds
and
knowing
that
russia
was
very
rich
in
gold
and
diamonds
she
always
had
an
especially
bewitching
smile
for
russian
grandees
had
count
orloff
come
in
person
to
bring
the
diamonds
she
would
undoubtedly
have
more
admired
him
apparently
been
more
pleased
with
his
presence
than
with
his
costly
gift
but
as
he
was
not
there
there
was
no
necessity
for
dissimulation
she
read
count
orloff
s
billet
with
a
satisfied
smile
but
soon
laid
it
aside
for
the
delight
of
examining
the
jewels
how
that
shines
and
how
that
sparkles
said
the
exhilarated
poetess
not
even
a
lover
s
eyes
flash
so
brightly
nor
is
his
smile
so
proud
so
full
of
rich
certainty
as
the
sparkling
of
these
gems
they
are
enchanters
and
a
word
from
me
can
change
these
and
rosettes
into
a
beautiful
villa
or
into
a
fragrant
park
with
silent
arbors
intoxicating
odors
and
birds
all
that
is
promised
me
by
these
stones
a
lover
s
promises
do
not
express
half
so
much
and
only
to
think
that
it
is
carlo
my
former
lover
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
these
diamonds
from
love
to
him
i
wished
to
destroy
natalie
and
that
wish
procured
me
the
favor
of
the
russian
count
and
consequently
these
brilliants
poor
carlo
these
diamonds
outlast
you
how
bright
and
beautiful
were
your
glances
that
are
now
extinguished
by
death
but
this
cruel
inexorable
death
has
no
power
over
diamonds
it
can
not
strangle
these
as
thou
wert
strangled
poor
carlo
i
shall
remember
thee
this
evening
carlo
and
hope
the
thought
of
thee
may
inspire
me
for
a
right
beautiful
improvisation
on
death
i
shall
take
pains
to
bring
to
mind
thy
beautiful
form
overflowed
with
blood
yes
it
will
inspire
in
me
a
very
effective
improvisation
and
i
will
at
the
same
time
make
a
selection
from
my
dear
poets
of
some
striking
rhymes
upon
death
and
the
grave
and
when
i
have
the
rhymes
the
thoughts
and
words
will
come
of
themselves
rhymes
rhymes
these
are
the
main
things
with
poets
and
while
the
improvisatrice
was
thus
speaking
to
herself
she
had
mechanically
adorned
her
person
with
the
brilliants
attaching
the
beautiful
collar
to
her
neck
the
long
pendants
to
her
ears
and
placing
the
splendid
diadem
upon
her
brow
she
looked
exceedingly
beautiful
in
these
ornaments
and
consequently
rejoiced
that
her
friend
cardinal
francesco
albani
came
at
this
precise
moment
he
will
be
ravished
said
she
with
a
smile
advancing
to
meet
him
with
the
proud
and
imposing
dignity
of
a
queen
you
are
beautiful
as
a
goddess
exclaimed
the
cardinal
and
whoever
sees
you
thus
has
seen
the
protecting
divinity
of
ancient
rome
the
sublime
juno
queen
of
heaven
were
i
juno
would
you
consent
to
be
my
vulcan
roguishly
asked
corilla
no
said
albani
laughing
the
noble
juno
was
not
exactly
true
to
her
vulcan
and
i
require
a
faithful
love
would
you
be
that
corilla
we
shall
see
said
she
changing
the
arrangement
of
the
diadem
before
the
glass
we
shall
see
my
worthy
friend
but
forget
not
the
conditions
first
the
you
shall
have
it
triumphantly
responded
the
cardinal
are
you
certain
of
that
asked
corilla
with
flashing
eyes
and
glowing
cheeks
cardinal
francesco
albani
smiled
mysteriously
pope
ganganelli
is
ill
said
he
and
it
is
thought
he
will
die
the
dooming
letter
groaning
supported
by
his
faithful
lorenzo
s
arm
pope
ganganelli
slowly
moved
through
the
walks
of
his
garden
some
months
had
passed
since
the
suppression
of
the
order
of
the
jesuits
how
had
these
few
months
changed
poor
clement
where
was
the
peace
and
cheerfulness
of
his
face
where
was
the
sublime
expression
of
his
features
the
firm
and
noble
carriage
of
his
body
where
was
it
all
trembling
shattered
with
distorted
features
and
with
dull
eyes
crawled
he
about
with
groans
his
brow
wrinkled
his
lips
compressed
by
pain
and
inward
sorrow
no
one
dared
to
remain
with
him
he
spoke
to
no
one
but
lorenzo
was
yet
sometimes
able
to
drive
away
the
clouds
from
his
brow
and
to
recall
a
faint
smile
to
his
thin
pale
lips
he
had
also
succeeded
in
this
and
for
the
first
time
in
several
weeks
had
ganganelli
yielding
to
his
prayers
consented
to
a
walk
in
the
garden
of
the
quirinal
this
air
refreshes
me
said
the
pope
breathing
more
freely
it
seems
as
if
it
communicated
to
my
lungs
a
renewed
vital
power
and
caused
the
blood
to
flow
more
rapidly
in
my
veins
lorenzo
this
is
a
singularly
fortunate
day
for
me
and
i
will
make
the
most
of
it
come
we
will
repair
to
our
franciscan
place
that
is
an
admirable
idea
said
lorenzo
delighted
if
your
holiness
can
reach
it
you
will
recover
your
health
and
all
will
again
be
ganganelli
sighed
and
glanced
toward
heaven
with
a
sad
smile
health
said
he
ah
lorenzo
that
word
reminds
me
of
a
lost
paradise
the
avenging
angel
has
driven
me
from
it
and
i
shall
never
see
it
say
not
so
begged
lorenzo
secretly
wiping
a
tear
from
his
cheek
no
say
not
so
you
will
certainly
recover
yes
recover
replied
the
pope
for
death
is
a
recovery
and
in
the
end
perhaps
the
most
they
silently
walked
on
and
making
a
path
through
the
bushes
they
at
length
arrived
at
the
place
with
the
construction
of
which
lorenzo
had
some
months
before
surprised
the
pope
and
which
ganganelli
had
since
named
the
franciscan
so
joyfully
exclaimed
lorenzo
while
the
exhausted
pope
glided
down
upon
the
so
brother
clement
now
let
us
be
cheerful
you
know
that
here
we
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
pope
you
have
yourself
declared
that
here
you
would
be
brother
clement
and
nothing
more
now
brother
clement
was
always
a
healthy
man
full
of
juvenile
spirits
and
ah
my
friend
responded
ganganelli
i
fear
the
pope
has
secretly
followed
brother
clement
even
to
this
place
and
even
here
no
longer
leaves
him
free
no
no
it
is
no
longer
brother
clement
who
sits
groaning
here
it
is
the
vicegerent
of
god
the
father
of
christendom
the
holy
and
blessed
pope
and
if
you
knew
lorenzo
what
this
vicegerent
of
god
has
to
suffer
and
bear
how
his
blood
like
streams
of
fire
runs
through
his
veins
carbonizing
his
entrails
and
parching
the
roof
of
his
mouth
so
that
the
tongue
fast
cleaves
to
it
and
he
has
no
longer
the
power
to
complain
of
his
misery
and
such
a
crushed
this
miserable
infatuated
people
call
the
vicegerent
of
god
before
whom
they
bow
in
the
dust
ah
foolish
children
are
you
not
yourselves
disgusted
with
your
masquerade
and
do
you
not
blush
for
this
jest
see
you
not
said
lorenzo
with
forced
cheerfulness
that
since
you
are
here
you
have
against
your
will
again
become
brother
clement
and
inveigh
against
god
s
vicegerent
who
holds
his
splendid
court
in
the
vatican
and
quirinal
yes
yes
that
was
what
brother
clement
used
to
do
in
the
franciscan
convent
he
was
always
scolding
about
the
and
yet
he
let
men
befool
him
and
make
a
pope
of
him
said
ganganelli
ah
lorenzo
they
were
indeed
good
purposes
that
decided
me
and
good
and
holy
resolutions
were
in
me
when
i
bore
this
crown
of
peter
for
the
first
time
ah
i
was
then
so
young
not
in
years
but
in
hopes
and
illusions
i
was
so
enthusiastic
for
the
good
and
noble
and
i
wished
to
serve
it
to
honor
and
glorify
it
in
the
name
of
god
and
in
the
end
you
have
done
so
solemnly
responded
lorenzo
i
have
wished
to
do
so
sighed
ganganelli
but
there
it
has
ended
i
have
been
hemmed
in
everywhere
wherever
i
wished
to
press
through
i
have
always
found
a
wall
before
me
a
wall
of
prejudices
of
ancient
customs
once
received
as
indifferent
and
at
this
wall
my
cardinals
and
officials
held
watch
taking
care
that
my
will
should
be
broken
against
it
and
not
be
able
to
speak
through
in
order
to
let
in
a
little
freedom
a
little
fresh
air
into
our
walled
realm
they
have
curbed
and
weakened
my
will
until
nothing
more
of
it
subsists
and
of
my
holiest
resolutions
they
have
made
a
scarecrow
before
which
foreign
kings
and
princes
cry
murder
and
prophesy
the
downfall
of
their
kingdoms
if
i
adhere
to
my
innovations
ah
the
princes
the
princes
i
tell
you
lorenzo
it
is
the
princes
who
have
undermined
the
happiness
of
the
world
with
their
ideas
of
absolute
power
they
are
the
robbers
of
all
mankind
for
freedom
which
is
the
common
property
of
all
men
that
have
they
like
regular
lawless
highwaymen
appropriated
for
themselves
alone
they
plundered
the
of
all
mankind
and
coined
them
into
money
adorned
with
their
likenesses
and
now
all
mankind
run
after
this
money
thinking
if
i
gain
that
then
shall
i
have
recovered
my
part
of
human
happiness
which
once
belonged
to
all
in
common
it
has
come
to
this
lorenzo
through
the
rapacity
of
princes
and
yet
they
still
tremble
upon
their
thrones
and
fear
that
the
people
may
one
day
awake
from
their
stupid
slumber
all
rising
as
one
man
and
cry
in
the
paling
faces
of
their
robbers
give
back
what
you
have
taken
from
us
we
will
have
what
is
ours
we
require
freedom
and
human
right
we
will
no
longer
remain
slaves
to
tremble
before
a
bugbear
we
will
be
free
children
of
god
and
have
no
one
to
fear
but
the
god
above
us
and
the
consciences
within
our
own
breasts
come
down
therefore
from
your
usurped
thrones
become
once
more
human
labor
enjoy
complain
and
rejoice
as
other
men
do
live
not
upon
the
sweat
of
your
subjects
but
nourish
yourselves
by
your
own
efforts
that
justice
may
prevail
in
the
world
and
humanity
regain
its
rights
and
ganganelli
s
eyes
flashed
his
sunken
cheeks
were
feverishly
flushed
while
he
was
thus
speaking
lorenzo
observed
it
with
anxious
eyes
and
when
the
pope
made
a
momentary
pause
he
said
you
are
again
altogether
the
good
and
brave
brother
clement
but
even
he
should
think
about
sparing
himself
and
to
what
end
should
he
spare
himself
excitedly
exclaimed
ganganelli
death
sits
within
me
and
laughs
to
scorn
all
my
efforts
burying
himself
deeper
and
deeper
in
my
inward
life
you
must
know
lorenzo
that
my
cause
of
sorrow
is
precisely
this
that
i
now
live
in
vain
and
that
i
can
not
finish
what
i
began
i
wished
to
make
my
people
happy
and
free
that
was
what
alarmed
all
these
princes
that
was
an
innovation
and
they
have
all
put
their
heads
together
and
whispered
to
each
other
he
will
betray
to
mankind
that
they
have
rights
of
which
we
have
robbed
them
he
wishes
to
give
back
to
mankind
his
inherited
portion
of
the
booty
but
what
will
then
become
of
us
will
not
our
slaves
rise
up
against
us
demanding
their
human
rights
we
can
not
suffer
such
innovations
for
they
involve
our
destruction
thus
have
they
cried
and
in
their
anxiety
they
have
decided
upon
my
death
then
they
threw
me
in
a
crumb
exactly
suited
to
my
dreams
of
improving
the
happiness
of
the
people
they
all
consented
that
i
should
relieve
mankind
from
that
dangerous
tapeworm
jesuitism
and
with
secret
laughter
thought
it
will
be
the
death
of
him
and
they
were
right
these
sly
princes
it
will
be
the
death
of
me
i
have
abolished
the
order
of
jesuits
in
consequence
of
which
i
shall
die
but
the
jesuits
will
live
and
live
forever
the
echo
of
approaching
footsteps
was
now
heard
and
sinking
with
fatigue
he
directed
lorenzo
to
go
and
meet
the
intruder
and
by
no
means
to
let
any
one
penetrate
to
him
returning
alone
lorenzo
handed
the
pope
a
letter
the
courier
whom
you
sent
out
some
days
since
has
returned
said
he
this
is
his
taking
the
letter
with
a
sad
smile
the
pope
weighed
it
in
his
hand
how
light
is
this
little
sheet
said
he
and
yet
how
heavy
are
its
contents
do
you
know
what
this
letter
contains
lorenzo
how
can
i
a
poor
cloister
brother
is
not
this
letter
said
the
pope
with
solemnity
brings
me
life
or
death
it
is
the
answer
of
the
learned
physician
professor
brunelli
of
bologna
you
have
written
to
him
asked
lorenzo
turning
pale
i
wrote
him
particularly
describing
my
condition
and
sufferings
in
god
s
name
i
conjured
him
to
tell
me
the
truth
and
brunelli
is
a
man
of
honor
he
will
do
it
am
i
right
therefore
in
saying
that
the
contents
of
this
letter
are
very
heavy
lorenzo
trembled
and
grasping
the
pope
s
hand
he
hastily
and
anxiously
said
no
read
it
not
of
what
use
will
it
be
to
learn
its
contents
it
is
tempting
god
to
endeavor
to
learn
the
future
in
advance
let
me
destroy
this
fatal
letter
and
while
his
faithful
servant
respectfully
stood
back
ganganelli
broke
the
seal
a
pause
ensued
a
long
excruciating
pause
lorenzo
kneeling
prayed
pope
ganganelli
read
the
letter
of
the
physician
of
bologna
his
face
had
assumed
a
mortal
pallor
while
reading
his
lips
trembled
and
rolled
slowly
down
over
his
sunken
cheeks
falling
from
his
hand
the
letter
rustled
to
the
earth
with
hanging
head
and
folded
hands
sat
the
pope
lorenzo
was
still
upon
his
knees
praying
ganganelli
suddenly
raised
his
head
his
eyes
were
turned
heavenward
a
cheerful
peace
beamed
from
his
eyes
and
with
a
clear
exulting
voice
he
said
lord
thy
will
be
done
i
resign
myself
to
thy
holy
the
letter
then
brings
good
news
asked
lorenzo
misled
by
the
joyfulness
of
the
pope
there
is
then
no
ground
for
the
presentiments
of
death
and
the
learned
doctor
says
you
will
live
the
life
eternal
lorenzo
said
ganganelli
this
letter
confirms
my
suppositions
brunelli
is
a
man
of
honor
and
he
has
told
me
the
truth
lorenzo
would
you
know
what
signifies
this
consuming
fire
this
weariness
and
relaxation
of
my
limbs
it
is
the
effect
of
oh
my
god
shrieked
lorenzo
you
are
poisoned
irretrievably
calmly
responded
the
pope
brunelli
says
it
and
i
feel
in
my
burning
entrails
that
he
speaks
the
and
are
there
no
remedies
lamented
lorenzo
wringing
his
hands
no
means
at
least
of
prolonging
your
life
there
is
such
a
means
and
brunelli
recommends
it
the
application
of
the
greatest
possible
heat
the
production
of
a
continual
perspiration
which
may
a
little
retard
the
progress
of
the
evil
and
perhaps
prolong
my
life
for
a
few
weeks
lorenzo
it
is
my
duty
to
struggle
every
day
with
death
i
have
yet
much
to
complete
before
i
die
yet
much
labor
before
i
go
to
my
eternal
rest
and
as
far
as
i
can
i
must
bring
to
an
end
what
i
have
commenced
for
the
welfare
of
my
people
come
lorenzo
let
us
return
to
the
vatican
set
pans
of
coals
in
my
room
procure
me
furs
and
a
glowing
hot
sun
i
would
yet
live
some
weeks
with
feverish
impetuosity
ganganelli
grasped
lorenzo
s
arm
and
drew
him
away
then
suddenly
stopping
he
turned
toward
his
favorite
place
lorenzo
he
said
in
a
low
tone
and
with
deep
sadness
it
was
yet
very
pleasant
in
the
franciscan
cloister
why
did
we
not
remain
there
only
see
my
friend
how
beautifully
the
sun
glitters
there
among
the
pines
and
how
delightfully
this
air
fans
us
ah
lorenzo
this
world
is
so
beautiful
so
very
beautiful
why
must
i
leave
it
so
soon
lorenzo
made
no
answer
he
could
not
speak
for
tears
ganganelli
cast
a
long
and
silent
glance
around
him
greeting
with
his
eyes
the
trees
and
flowers
the
green
earth
and
the
blue
sky
farewell
farewell
thou
beautiful
nature
he
whispered
low
we
take
our
leave
of
each
other
i
shall
never
again
see
these
trees
or
this
grassy
seat
but
you
lorenzo
will
i
establish
as
the
guardian
of
this
place
and
when
you
sometimes
sit
here
in
the
still
evening
hour
then
will
you
think
of
me
now
come
we
must
away
feel
you
not
this
cool
and
gentle
air
oh
how
refreshingly
it
fans
and
cools
but
i
dare
not
enjoy
it
not
i
this
cooling
cuts
off
a
day
from
my
life
and
with
the
haste
of
a
youth
ganganelli
ran
down
the
alley
bathed
with
perspiration
breathless
with
heat
he
arrived
at
the
palace
now
give
me
furs
bring
pans
of
coals
lorenzo
shut
all
the
doors
and
windows
procure
me
a
heat
that
will
shut
out
death
but
death
nevertheless
came
the
furs
and
coverings
the
steaming
with
which
the
pope
surrounded
himself
the
glowing
atmosphere
he
day
and
night
inhaled
and
which
quite
prostrated
his
friends
and
servants
all
that
could
only
keep
off
death
for
some
few
weeks
not
drive
it
away
more
dreadful
yet
than
this
blasting
heat
with
which
ganganelli
surrounded
himself
yet
more
horrible
was
the
fire
that
consumed
his
entrails
and
burned
in
his
blood
finally
withered
and
consumed
by
these
external
and
internal
fires
the
pope
greeted
death
as
a
deliverer
and
sank
into
his
arms
with
a
smile
but
no
sooner
had
he
respired
his
last
breath
no
sooner
had
the
ceased
in
this
throat
and
no
sooner
had
death
extinguished
the
light
in
his
eyes
than
the
cold
corpse
exhibited
a
most
horrible
change
the
thin
white
hair
fell
off
as
if
blown
away
by
a
breath
of
air
the
loosened
teeth
fell
from
their
sockets
the
formerly
quietly
smiling
visage
became
horribly
distorted
the
nose
sank
in
and
the
eyes
fell
out
the
muscles
of
all
his
limbs
became
relaxed
as
if
by
a
magic
stroke
and
the
rapidly
putrefying
members
fell
from
each
other
the
pope
s
two
physicians
standing
near
the
bed
looked
with
terror
upon
the
frightful
spectacle
he
was
then
right
murmured
the
physician
barbi
folding
his
hands
he
was
poisoned
these
are
the
effects
of
the
salicetti
the
second
physician
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
contemptuous
smile
think
as
you
will
said
he
for
my
part
i
shall
prove
to
the
world
that
pope
clement
xiv
died
a
natural
thus
saying
salicetti
left
the
chamber
of
death
with
a
proud
step
betaking
himself
to
his
own
room
to
commence
his
history
of
ganganelli
s
last
illness
in
which
despite
the
arsenic
found
in
the
stomach
of
the
corpse
and
despite
the
fact
that
all
rome
was
convinced
of
the
poisoning
of
the
pope
and
named
his
murderer
with
loud
curses
he
endeavored
to
prove
that
ganganelli
died
of
a
scrofula
and
while
ganganelli
breathed
out
his
last
sigh
resounded
the
bells
of
peter
s
thundered
the
cannon
of
castle
angelo
and
the
curious
people
thronged
around
the
vatican
where
the
conclave
was
in
solemn
session
for
the
choice
of
a
new
pope
thousands
stared
up
to
the
palace
thousands
prayed
upon
their
knees
until
at
length
the
doors
of
the
balcony
behind
which
the
conclave
was
in
session
were
opened
and
the
papal
master
of
ceremonies
made
his
appearance
upon
it
at
a
given
signal
the
bells
became
silent
the
cannon
ceased
to
thunder
and
breathlessly
listened
the
crowd
the
master
of
ceremonies
advanced
to
the
front
of
the
balcony
a
pause
a
silent
dreadful
pause
his
voice
then
resounded
over
the
great
square
and
the
listeners
heard
these
words
pontificem
maximum
pium
vi
we
have
pope
pius
vi
and
the
bells
rang
anew
the
cannon
thundered
drums
beat
and
trumpets
sounded
upon
the
balcony
appeared
the
new
pope
juan
angelo
braschi
pius
bestowing
his
blessing
upon
the
kneeling
people
as
they
now
had
a
new
pope
nothing
remained
to
be
done
for
the
deceased
pope
but
to
bury
him
and
they
buried
him
in
solemn
procession
followed
by
all
the
cardinals
and
high
church
officials
surrounded
by
the
swiss
guards
the
tolling
of
the
bells
and
the
dull
rolling
of
the
muffled
drums
the
solemn
hymns
of
the
priests
moved
the
funeral
from
the
vatican
to
peter
s
church
in
the
usual
open
coffin
lay
the
corpse
of
the
deceased
pope
that
the
people
might
see
him
for
the
last
time
as
they
passed
the
bridge
of
angelo
when
the
coffin
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
bridge
arose
a
shriek
of
terror
from
thousands
of
throats
a
leg
had
become
severed
from
the
body
and
hung
out
of
the
coffin
swinging
in
a
fold
of
the
cardinal
albani
who
walked
near
the
coffin
was
touched
on
the
shoulder
by
the
loosely
swinging
limb
and
turned
pale
but
he
yet
had
the
courage
to
push
it
back
into
the
coffin
the
people
loudly
murmured
and
shudderingly
whispered
to
each
other
the
dead
man
has
touched
his
murderer
they
have
poisoned
him
our
good
pope
his
members
fall
apart
that
is
the
effect
of
archenholz
relates
yet
another
case
where
the
acqua
tofana
had
a
similar
violent
and
sudden
effect
a
respectable
roman
lady
who
was
young
and
beautiful
and
had
many
admirers
made
in
the
year
a
similar
experiment
to
rid
herself
of
an
old
husband
as
the
dose
was
rather
strong
death
was
followed
by
the
rapid
and
violent
separation
of
the
members
they
employed
all
possible
means
to
retain
the
body
in
a
human
form
until
the
funeral
was
over
the
face
was
covered
with
a
waxen
mask
and
by
this
means
was
the
condition
of
the
corpse
concealed
this
separation
of
the
members
seems
to
be
the
usual
effect
of
this
poison
and
is
said
to
occur
as
soon
as
the
body
is
the
infernal
work
had
therefore
proved
successful
the
vengeance
was
complete
ganganelli
was
no
more
and
upon
the
papal
throne
sat
braschi
the
friend
of
the
jesuits
and
of
cardinal
albani
to
whom
he
had
promised
the
crowning
of
the
improvisatrice
corilla
and
as
this
cost
nothing
to
the
miserly
pope
pius
he
this
time
found
no
inconvenience
in
keeping
his
sacred
promise
though
not
so
promptly
as
corilla
and
the
passionate
cardinal
desired
not
until
almost
two
years
after
braschi
had
mounted
the
papal
throne
took
place
the
crowning
of
the
improvisatrice
in
the
capitol
at
rome
she
had
therefore
attained
the
object
of
her
wishes
she
had
finally
reached
it
by
bribery
and
intrigue
by
hypocritical
tenderness
by
the
resignation
of
her
maiden
modesty
and
womanly
honor
and
by
all
the
arts
of
coquetry
but
this
triumph
of
hers
was
not
to
be
untroubled
the
shouted
for
her
and
the
cardinals
and
princes
of
the
church
but
the
people
accompanied
her
to
the
capitol
with
hissing
and
howling
poems
came
fluttering
down
on
all
sides
the
first
that
fell
upon
corilla
s
head
cardinal
albani
eagerly
seized
and
unfolded
for
the
purpose
of
reading
it
aloud
but
after
the
first
few
lines
his
voice
was
silenced
it
was
an
abusive
poem
full
of
mockery
and
scorn
but
nevertheless
she
was
crowned
she
still
stood
upon
the
capitol
with
the
upon
her
brow
cheered
by
her
respectable
protectors
and
friends
but
the
people
joined
not
in
those
cheers
and
as
the
exulting
shouts
ceased
there
swelled
up
to
the
poetess
from
thousands
of
voices
a
thundering
laugh
of
scorn
and
this
scornful
laugh
this
hissing
and
howling
of
the
people
accompanied
her
upon
her
return
from
the
capitol
following
her
through
the
streets
to
her
own
door
the
people
had
judged
her
corilla
was
no
poetess
by
the
grace
of
god
and
only
by
the
grace
of
man
had
she
been
crowned
as
queen
of
poesy
mortified
crushed
and
enraged
she
fled
from
rome
to
florence
she
knew
how
to
flatter
the
great
and
win
princes
she
was
a
and
the
people
rejected
her
but
the
laurel
was
hers
she
was
sought
and
esteemed
the
princes
admired
her
and
catharine
of
russia
fulfilled
the
promise
orloff
had
made
the
improvisatrice
in
the
name
of
the
empress
corilla
received
a
pension
from
russia
russia
has
always
promptly
and
liberally
paid
those
who
have
sold
themselves
and
rendered
services
to
her
russia
is
very
rich
and
can
always
send
so
many
thousands
of
her
best
and
noblest
to
work
in
the
mines
of
siberia
that
she
can
never
lack
means
for
paying
her
spies
and
agents
the
russian
officer
with
carlo
s
death
natalie
had
lost
her
last
friend
with
the
stolen
money
and
diamonds
marianne
was
robbed
of
her
last
pecuniary
means
but
natalie
paid
no
attention
to
marianne
s
lamentations
what
cared
she
for
poverty
and
destitution
what
knew
she
of
these
outward
treasures
of
this
wealth
consisting
in
gold
and
jewels
natalie
knew
only
that
she
had
been
robbed
of
a
noble
spiritual
possession
that
they
had
murdered
the
friend
who
had
consecrated
himself
to
her
with
such
true
and
devoted
love
and
weeping
over
his
body
she
dedicated
to
him
the
tribute
of
a
tear
of
the
purest
gratitude
of
saddest
lamentation
but
so
imperfect
is
the
world
that
it
often
leaves
no
time
for
mourning
that
in
the
midst
of
our
sorrow
it
causes
us
to
hear
the
prosaic
voices
of
reality
and
necessity
compelling
us
to
dry
our
eyes
and
turning
our
thoughts
from
remembrances
of
a
lost
happiness
to
the
realities
of
practical
life
natalie
s
soul
was
to
experience
this
rough
contact
of
reality
and
with
an
internal
shudder
must
she
bend
under
the
rough
hand
of
the
present
pale
breathless
trembling
rushed
marianne
into
the
room
where
natalie
in
solitary
mourning
was
weeping
for
her
lost
friend
we
are
ruined
hopelessly
ruined
screamed
marianne
they
will
drive
us
from
our
last
possession
they
will
turn
us
out
of
our
house
all
the
misfortunes
of
the
whole
world
break
over
and
crush
us
the
young
maiden
looked
at
her
with
a
calm
clear
glance
then
let
them
crush
us
she
quietly
said
it
is
better
to
be
crushed
at
once
than
to
be
slowly
and
lingeringly
wasted
but
you
hear
me
not
princess
shrieked
marianne
wringing
her
hands
they
will
drive
us
from
here
i
tell
you
they
will
expel
you
from
your
house
and
who
will
do
that
asked
the
young
maiden
proudly
rising
with
flashing
eyes
who
dares
threaten
me
in
my
own
house
without
are
soldiers
and
bailiffs
and
the
officers
of
the
russian
embassy
they
have
made
a
forcible
entrance
and
with
force
they
will
expel
you
from
the
house
they
are
already
sealing
the
doors
and
seizing
everything
in
the
a
dark
purple
glow
for
a
moment
overspread
natalie
s
cheeks
and
her
glance
was
flame
i
will
see
said
she
who
has
the
boldness
to
dispute
my
possession
of
my
own
property
with
proud
steps
and
elevated
head
she
strode
through
the
room
to
the
door
opening
upon
the
corridor
the
bailiffs
and
soldiers
who
had
been
placed
there
respectfully
stood
aside
natalie
paid
no
attention
to
them
but
immediately
advanced
to
the
officer
who
with
a
loud
voice
was
just
then
commanding
them
to
seal
all
the
doors
and
see
that
nothing
was
taken
from
the
rooms
i
wish
to
know
said
natalie
with
her
clear
voice
i
wish
to
know
by
what
right
people
here
force
their
way
into
my
house
and
what
excuse
you
have
for
this
shameless
conduct
the
officer
who
was
no
other
than
stephano
bowed
to
her
with
a
slightly
ironical
smile
justice
needs
no
excuse
said
he
on
the
part
and
by
command
of
her
illustrious
majesty
the
great
empress
catharine
i
lay
an
attachment
upon
this
house
and
all
it
contains
it
is
from
this
hour
the
sacred
possession
of
her
russian
it
is
the
exclusive
property
of
the
count
paulo
proudly
responded
natalie
it
was
the
property
of
count
paul
rasczinsky
said
stephano
but
convicted
traitors
have
no
property
this
criminal
count
has
been
convicted
of
the
mercy
of
the
empress
has
indeed
changed
the
sentence
of
death
into
one
of
eternal
banishment
to
siberia
but
she
has
been
pleased
to
approve
the
confiscation
of
all
he
possessed
in
virtue
of
this
approval
and
by
permission
of
the
holy
roman
government
i
attach
this
house
and
its
contents
natalie
no
longer
heard
him
almost
unconscious
lay
she
in
marianne
s
arms
paulo
was
lost
sentenced
to
death
imprisoned
and
banished
for
life
that
was
all
she
had
heard
and
comprehended
this
terrible
news
had
confused
and
benumbed
her
senses
sir
implored
marianne
pressing
natalie
to
her
bosom
you
will
at
least
have
some
mercy
upon
this
young
maiden
you
will
not
thrust
us
out
upon
the
streets
you
will
grant
us
a
quiet
residence
in
this
house
until
we
can
collect
our
effects
and
secure
what
is
indisputably
ours
every
thing
in
this
house
is
the
indisputable
property
of
the
empress
roughly
responded
stephano
but
not
ourselves
i
hope
excitedly
exclaimed
marianne
this
imperial
power
does
not
extend
over
our
persons
stephano
roughly
replied
the
door
stands
open
go
but
go
directly
or
i
shall
be
compelled
to
arrest
you
for
opposing
the
execution
of
the
laws
and
stirring
up
sedition
yes
let
us
go
cried
natalie
who
had
recovered
her
consciousness
let
us
go
marianne
let
us
not
remain
a
moment
longer
in
a
house
belonging
to
that
barbarous
russian
empress
who
has
condemned
the
noble
count
paulo
as
a
criminal
and
taken
forcible
possession
of
his
property
and
following
the
first
impulse
of
her
noble
pride
the
young
maiden
took
marianne
by
the
hand
and
drew
her
away
they
at
least
shall
not
forcibly
eject
us
said
she
no
no
we
will
go
of
our
own
free
will
but
where
shall
we
go
cried
marianne
wringing
her
hands
where
god
wills
solemnly
responded
the
young
maiden
and
upon
what
shall
we
live
wailed
marianne
we
are
now
totally
destitute
and
helpless
how
shall
we
live
we
will
work
said
natalie
firmly
a
peculiar
calm
had
come
over
her
misfortune
had
awakened
a
new
quality
in
her
nature
sorrow
had
struck
a
new
string
in
her
being
she
was
no
longer
the
delicate
gentle
suffering
unresisting
child
she
felt
in
herself
a
firm
resolution
a
bold
courage
an
almost
joyful
daring
and
an
invincible
calmness
work
will
work
princess
whispered
marianne
i
will
learn
it
said
she
and
with
a
constantly
quickened
step
they
approached
the
outlet
of
the
garden
the
gate
which
led
out
into
the
street
was
wide
open
soldiers
in
russian
uniform
had
been
stationed
before
it
keeping
back
with
their
carbines
the
curious
romans
who
crowded
around
in
great
numbers
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
get
a
peep
into
the
charmed
garden
see
there
she
comes
the
garden
fairy
cried
they
all
as
natalie
neared
the
gate
how
beautiful
she
is
how
beautiful
they
loudly
exclaimed
that
is
a
real
fairy
a
divinity
natalie
heard
none
of
these
expressions
of
admiration
she
had
but
one
object
one
thought
she
wished
to
leave
the
garden
she
wished
to
go
forth
she
had
no
regrets
no
complaints
for
this
lost
paradise
she
only
wished
to
get
out
of
it
even
if
it
was
to
go
to
her
death
but
the
soldiers
stationed
at
the
gate
opposed
her
progress
natalie
regarded
them
with
terror
and
amazement
they
can
not
at
least
oppose
my
voluntary
resignation
of
my
property
said
she
away
with
these
muskets
and
sabres
i
would
pass
out
and
the
young
maiden
boldly
advanced
a
step
but
those
weapons
stretched
before
her
like
a
wall
and
natalie
was
now
overcome
by
anguish
and
despair
the
inconsolable
feeling
of
her
total
abandonment
of
her
miserable
isolation
tears
burst
from
her
eyes
her
pride
was
broken
she
was
again
the
trembling
young
girl
no
longer
the
heroic
woman
she
wept
and
in
tremulous
tone
with
folded
hands
she
implored
of
these
rough
soldiers
a
little
mercy
a
little
compassion
they
understood
not
her
language
they
had
no
sympathy
but
the
crowd
were
touched
by
the
tears
of
the
beautiful
girl
and
by
the
sad
lamentations
of
her
companion
they
screamed
they
howled
they
insulted
the
soldiers
they
swore
to
liberate
the
two
women
by
force
if
the
soldiers
any
longer
refused
them
a
passage
dumb
unshaken
immovable
like
a
wall
stood
the
soldiers
with
their
weapons
stretched
forth
through
the
hissing
and
tumult
a
loud
and
commanding
voice
was
suddenly
heard
to
ask
what
is
going
on
here
what
means
this
disturbance
an
officer
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
approached
the
garden
gate
the
soldiers
respectfully
gave
way
and
he
stepped
into
the
garden
oh
sir
said
natalie
turning
to
him
her
tearful
face
if
you
are
an
honorable
man
have
compassion
for
an
abandoned
and
unprotected
maiden
and
command
these
soldiers
who
seem
to
obey
you
to
let
me
and
my
companion
go
forth
the
russian
officer
joseph
ribas
bowed
low
and
respectfully
to
her
if
it
is
the
princess
tartaroff
whom
i
have
the
honor
of
addressing
said
he
i
must
in
the
name
of
my
illustrious
lord
beg
your
pardon
for
what
has
improperly
occurred
here
at
his
command
i
come
to
set
it
all
right
thus
speaking
he
returned
to
the
soldiers
and
in
a
low
tone
exchanged
some
words
with
their
leader
the
latter
bowed
respectfully
and
at
his
signal
the
soldiers
shut
the
gate
and
retired
into
the
street
am
i
to
be
detained
here
as
a
prisoner
exclaimed
natalie
am
i
not
allowed
to
leave
this
garden
your
grace
preliminarily
can
still
consider
this
garden
as
your
own
property
he
respectfully
responded
i
am
commanded
to
watch
that
no
one
dare
to
disturb
you
here
and
for
this
purpose
my
lord
respectfully
requests
that
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
permit
me
to
remain
in
your
house
as
the
guardian
of
your
and
who
is
this
generous
man
asked
natalie
he
is
a
man
who
has
made
a
solemn
vow
to
protect
innocence
everywhere
when
he
finds
it
threatened
solemnly
responded
joseph
ribas
he
is
a
man
who
is
ready
to
shed
his
blood
for
the
princess
tartaroff
who
is
surrounded
by
enemies
and
dangers
a
man
he
continued
in
a
lower
tone
who
knows
and
loves
your
friend
and
guardian
count
paulo
and
will
soon
bring
you
secret
and
sure
news
from
him
he
knows
count
paulo
joyfully
exclaimed
natalie
oh
then
all
is
well
i
may
safely
confide
in
whoever
knows
and
loves
count
paulo
for
he
must
bear
in
his
bosom
a
noble
heart
and
turning
to
joseph
ribas
with
a
charming
smile
she
said
sir
lead
me
now
where
you
will
we
will
both
gladly
follow
you
let
us
first
of
all
go
into
the
villa
and
send
away
those
troublesome
people
said
the
russian
officer
preceding
the
two
women
to
the
house
the
bailiffs
and
soldiers
were
still
there
occupied
with
sealing
the
doors
and
closets
joseph
ribas
approached
them
with
angry
glances
and
turning
to
stephano
said
sir
i
shall
call
you
to
account
for
this
and
illegal
proceeding
i
am
in
my
right
morosely
answered
stephano
here
is
the
command
to
attach
this
villa
it
has
fallen
to
the
russian
crown
as
the
property
of
the
traitor
there
is
only
the
one
error
to
be
corrected
said
joseph
ribas
that
this
villa
was
not
the
property
of
count
rasczinsky
as
he
some
months
ago
sold
it
to
his
friend
my
master
and
as
so
far
as
i
know
the
illustrious
count
my
master
never
was
a
traitor
you
will
please
to
respect
his
property
you
will
have
first
to
authenticate
your
assertions
responded
stephano
with
a
rude
laugh
here
is
the
documental
authentication
said
joseph
ribas
handing
a
paper
to
stephano
the
latter
after
attentively
reading
the
documents
bowed
reverentially
and
said
sir
it
appears
that
i
was
certainly
mistaken
this
deed
of
gift
is
and
is
undersigned
by
his
grace
the
russian
ambassador
you
will
pardon
me
as
i
only
acted
according
to
my
joseph
ribas
answered
stephano
s
reverential
bow
with
a
haughty
nod
go
said
he
take
off
the
seals
in
the
quickest
possible
time
and
then
away
with
you
but
as
stephano
was
about
retiring
with
his
people
joseph
ribas
beckoned
him
back
again
you
have
therefore
recognized
this
deed
of
gift
asked
he
and
as
stephano
assented
he
continued
you
therefore
can
not
deny
that
my
master
is
the
undisputed
possessor
of
this
villa
and
can
do
with
it
according
to
his
pleasure
i
do
not
deny
it
at
all
growled
stephano
joseph
ribas
then
drew
forth
another
paper
which
he
also
handed
stephano
you
will
also
recognize
this
deed
of
gift
to
be
regular
and
legal
it
is
likewise
undersigned
and
authenticated
by
our
stephano
having
attentively
read
it
almost
indignantly
said
it
is
all
right
but
the
count
is
crazy
to
give
away
so
fine
a
property
and
still
grumbling
he
departed
with
his
people
clinging
to
marianne
s
side
natalie
had
observed
the
whole
proceeding
with
silent
wonder
and
with
the
astonishment
of
innocence
and
inexperience
she
comprehended
nothing
of
the
whole
scene
nor
was
a
suspicion
awakened
in
her
childishly
pure
soul
he
is
then
really
going
she
asked
as
stephano
was
slowly
moving
off
yes
he
is
going
said
joseph
ribas
and
will
never
venture
to
disturb
you
again
henceforth
you
will
be
in
undisputed
possession
of
your
property
my
lord
has
made
this
villa
and
garden
forever
yours
by
a
regular
legal
deed
of
and
who
is
your
lord
asked
natalie
tell
me
his
name
tell
me
where
i
may
find
him
that
i
may
return
him
my
thanks
yes
conduct
us
to
him
said
the
weeping
marianne
let
me
clasp
his
feet
and
implore
his
further
protection
for
my
poor
helpless
my
lord
desires
no
thanks
proudly
responded
ribas
he
does
good
for
his
own
sake
and
protects
innocence
because
that
is
the
duty
of
every
knight
and
at
least
tell
me
his
name
that
i
may
pray
for
him
sobbed
marianne
yes
his
name
said
natalie
with
a
charming
smile
ah
how
i
shall
love
that
name
his
name
is
his
own
secret
said
ribas
the
world
indeed
knows
and
blesses
him
calling
him
the
bravest
of
the
brave
but
it
is
his
command
that
you
shall
never
be
informed
of
it
he
desires
nothing
no
thanks
no
acknowledgments
he
wishes
only
to
secure
your
peace
and
happiness
and
thus
redeem
the
solemn
vow
he
made
to
his
friend
count
paulo
rasczinsky
to
guard
and
preserve
you
as
a
father
and
to
watch
over
you
as
your
tutelar
genius
thanks
thanks
my
god
cried
marianne
with
her
arms
raised
toward
heaven
thou
sendest
us
help
in
our
need
thou
hast
mercy
on
suffering
innocence
and
sendest
her
a
saviour
in
her
greatest
distress
the
young
maiden
said
nothing
her
radiant
glance
was
directed
heavenward
and
folding
her
hands
over
her
bosom
with
a
happy
grateful
smile
she
murmured
i
am
therefore
no
longer
alone
i
have
a
friend
who
watches
over
and
protects
me
whoever
he
may
be
he
is
sent
by
count
paulo
whatever
may
be
his
name
i
shall
be
forever
grateful
to
him
anticipation
from
that
day
had
a
new
and
marvellous
life
commenced
for
natalie
she
felt
herself
surrounded
by
a
dreamy
magic
fantastic
supernatural
life
it
seemed
as
if
some
invisible
genius
hovered
over
her
listening
to
all
her
thoughts
realizing
all
her
wishes
and
joseph
ribas
was
the
merry
kobold
of
this
invisible
deity
my
lord
is
not
satisfied
with
the
modest
furnishing
of
your
villa
said
he
to
natalie
on
the
first
day
he
begs
to
be
allowed
to
adorn
your
chamber
with
a
splendor
suited
to
your
rank
and
your
future
greatness
and
in
what
is
my
future
greatness
to
consist
asked
the
young
maiden
with
curiosity
that
will
be
made
known
to
you
at
the
proper
time
mysteriously
replied
joseph
ribas
who
will
tell
me
he
the
i
shall
therefore
see
him
she
joyfully
exclaimed
perhaps
will
you
however
first
allow
me
to
have
your
room
properly
furnished
this
villa
belongs
to
your
lord
said
natalie
it
is
for
him
as
lord
and
master
to
do
as
he
pleases
in
and
satisfied
ribas
hastened
away
to
return
in
a
few
hours
with
more
than
fifty
workmen
and
artists
in
order
to
commence
the
improvements
until
now
the
villa
had
been
finished
and
furnished
with
simple
elegance
one
missed
nothing
necessary
for
comfort
or
convenience
for
pleasantness
or
taste
but
it
was
still
only
the
elegant
and
fashionable
residence
of
a
private
person
now
as
by
the
stroke
of
a
magic
wand
this
villa
in
a
few
days
was
converted
into
the
splendid
palace
of
some
sultan
or
caliph
there
were
heavy
turkish
carpets
on
the
floors
velvet
curtains
with
gold
embroidery
at
the
windows
and
on
the
walls
the
richest
and
most
comfortable
divans
and
covered
with
stuffs
vases
ornamented
with
the
most
costly
precious
stones
noble
bronze
statues
beautiful
paintings
and
between
them
the
rarest
ornaments
glistening
with
jewels
which
modern
times
have
designated
by
the
name
of
ribs
there
were
delicate
little
trifles
of
inestimable
value
and
with
refined
taste
and
judgment
every
thing
was
sought
out
which
luxury
and
convenience
could
demand
with
childish
astonishment
and
ecstasy
natalie
wandered
through
these
rooms
which
she
hardly
recognized
in
their
splendid
ornamentation
and
stood
before
these
treasures
of
trifles
which
she
hardly
dared
to
touch
this
lord
must
be
either
a
magician
or
a
nabob
thoughtfully
remarked
marianne
it
must
have
required
millions
to
effect
all
natalie
asked
neither
whether
he
was
a
magician
a
millionaire
or
a
nabob
she
only
thought
she
was
to
see
him
and
be
allowed
to
thank
him
nothing
further
will
he
come
now
she
constantly
asked
of
the
humble
and
slavishly
devoted
joseph
ribas
will
he
come
now
that
his
house
is
prepared
for
his
reception
it
is
adorned
only
for
you
princess
humbly
replied
ribas
the
count
my
master
wishes
for
nothing
but
to
see
you
in
a
habitation
worthy
of
you
but
what
was
this
luxury
what
cared
she
for
these
treasures
the
value
of
which
she
was
incapable
of
estimating
and
which
were
indifferent
to
her
she
who
had
no
conception
of
wealth
or
of
money
she
who
knew
not
that
there
was
poverty
in
the
world
and
who
raised
in
an
eden
separated
from
the
world
had
no
idea
that
hunger
had
ever
made
its
appearance
within
it
she
knew
only
the
sorrows
of
the
happy
the
deprivations
of
the
rich
she
had
never
had
either
to
struggle
against
real
misfortune
or
to
experience
real
want
and
deprivation
now
indeed
a
deeper
sorrow
had
entered
into
her
life
she
had
lost
her
beloved
paternal
friend
count
paulo
and
carlo
also
had
been
torn
from
her
that
was
certainly
a
more
profound
sorrow
and
she
had
wept
much
for
both
of
them
but
yet
that
was
no
real
misfortune
she
had
never
yet
lost
the
whole
substance
of
her
life
for
those
two
however
much
she
might
always
have
loved
them
had
nevertheless
not
entirely
filled
out
her
life
they
had
been
a
part
of
her
happiness
but
not
that
happiness
itself
and
she
awaited
happiness
she
awaited
it
with
ecstasy
and
devotion
with
feverish
hope
and
glowing
desire
she
knew
not
and
asked
not
in
what
this
happiness
was
to
consist
and
yet
her
heart
yearned
for
it
she
called
for
this
unknown
and
nameless
happiness
with
a
throbbing
bosom
and
tremulously
whispering
lips
she
was
so
much
alone
she
had
so
much
time
for
dreaming
and
intoxicating
herself
with
fantastic
imaginations
she
was
surrounded
by
a
fabulous
world
and
she
was
the
fairy
of
that
world
but
out
of
that
fabulous
world
she
sometimes
longed
to
be
out
of
the
ideal
into
the
real
she
yearned
for
truth
and
actuality
then
she
would
call
joseph
ribas
to
her
side
and
bid
him
relate
to
her
of
that
unknown
lord
his
master
he
told
her
of
his
battles
and
his
heroic
deeds
of
his
wonderful
acts
of
bravery
and
the
young
maiden
tremblingly
and
shudderingly
listened
to
him
she
feared
this
man
who
had
shed
streams
of
blood
and
whose
enemies
with
their
dying
lips
had
lauded
as
the
greatest
of
heroes
and
joseph
ribas
smiled
when
he
saw
her
turn
pale
and
tremble
and
he
would
speak
to
her
of
his
generosity
and
humanity
of
his
knighthood
and
virtue
he
related
to
her
how
on
one
occasion
at
the
risk
of
his
life
he
had
protected
and
saved
a
persecuted
young
maiden
how
on
another
he
had
taken
pity
on
a
helpless
old
man
and
singly
had
defended
him
against
a
host
of
bloodthirsty
enemies
he
also
spoke
to
her
of
the
sorrow
of
his
master
on
account
of
the
ingratitude
and
deceptions
he
had
experienced
and
natalie
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
with
reproachful
glances
she
asked
of
heaven
how
it
could
have
permitted
the
virtue
of
this
noble
unknown
hero
to
be
so
severely
tried
and
the
baseness
of
mankind
to
trouble
him
that
is
it
then
ribas
would
often
say
he
diffuses
happiness
everywhere
around
him
while
he
himself
has
it
not
he
makes
glad
and
cheerful
faces
wherever
he
appears
and
his
own
is
the
only
serious
and
sad
brow
mankind
have
made
him
hopeless
and
for
himself
he
no
longer
believes
in
happiness
ah
how
then
did
the
heart
of
this
innocent
child
tremble
and
how
she
longed
to
find
some
means
for
restoring
his
belief
in
happiness
but
why
does
he
not
come
to
those
who
love
him
asked
she
why
does
he
decline
the
thanks
of
those
whose
hearts
are
truly
devoted
to
him
ah
in
our
humid
eyes
and
faces
he
would
recognize
the
truthfulness
of
our
feelings
why
then
comes
he
not
i
will
tell
you
said
ribas
with
a
smile
he
hates
women
because
the
only
one
he
ever
loved
was
false
to
him
and
now
his
love
is
changed
to
ardent
hatred
of
all
women
i
shall
therefore
never
see
him
sighed
the
girl
hanging
her
head
with
the
sadness
of
disappointment
this
expectation
this
constantly
increasing
impatience
rendered
her
inaccessible
to
any
other
feeling
any
other
thought
he
of
whom
she
did
not
know
even
the
name
was
sent
by
paulo
and
therefore
had
she
believed
and
confided
in
him
from
the
first
now
had
she
already
forgotten
that
she
had
confided
in
him
on
paulo
s
account
she
believed
in
him
on
his
own
account
and
paulo
had
retreated
into
the
background
occasionally
also
the
bloody
image
of
poor
carlo
presented
itself
to
her
mind
and
she
secretly
reproached
herself
for
having
mourned
him
for
so
short
a
time
for
having
so
soon
forgotten
that
faithful
friend
but
even
these
reproaches
were
soon
silenced
when
with
a
throbbing
bosom
she
thought
of
this
new
friend
who
like
a
divinity
hovered
over
her
at
an
infinite
and
unattainable
distance
and
whose
mysteriously
active
nearness
replaced
both
of
those
friends
she
had
lost
and
for
whom
she
could
no
longer
mourn
he
it
is
now
high
time
said
joseph
ribas
one
day
as
coming
from
natalie
he
entered
the
boudoir
of
count
alexis
orloff
now
your
excellency
the
right
moment
has
come
you
must
show
yourself
or
this
curious
child
will
consume
herself
with
a
longing
that
has
changed
her
blood
to
fire
she
thinks
of
nothing
but
you
with
open
eyes
she
dreams
of
you
and
without
the
least
suspicion
that
any
one
is
listening
to
her
she
speaks
to
you
ah
with
what
modest
tenderness
and
with
what
humble
devotion
i
tell
you
your
excellency
you
are
highly
blessed
there
is
no
child
more
innocent
no
woman
more
glowing
with
love
and
she
knows
it
not
no
she
has
not
the
least
suspicion
that
she
already
loves
you
with
enthusiasm
and
thirsts
for
your
kisses
as
the
rose
for
the
morning
dew
she
knows
nothing
of
her
love
she
shall
learn
something
of
it
said
orloff
laughing
it
will
be
a
pleasant
task
to
enlighten
this
little
unknowing
one
as
to
her
own
feelings
and
i
flatter
myself
i
understand
how
to
do
endeavor
above
all
things
your
excellency
to
realize
the
ideal
she
bears
in
her
heart
she
expects
to
see
nothing
less
than
an
apollo
whose
radiant
beauty
will
annihilate
her
as
jupiter
did
semele
well
in
that
i
hope
she
has
not
deceived
herself
responded
orloff
with
a
glance
into
the
mirror
if
i
am
not
jupiter
yet
they
call
me
hercules
and
he
you
know
was
the
son
of
jupiter
and
indeed
his
handsomest
son
and
be
you
not
only
a
hercules
but
a
zephyr
and
apollo
at
the
same
time
make
her
tremble
before
your
heroic
character
and
at
the
same
time
win
her
confidence
in
your
humble
modest
love
then
is
she
yours
you
must
cautiously
and
noiselessly
spread
your
nets
you
must
not
wound
her
delicate
sensitiveness
by
a
word
or
look
or
she
will
flee
from
you
like
a
frightened
gazelle
oh
should
she
wish
to
flee
my
arms
are
strong
enough
to
hold
her
yet
is
it
better
to
hold
her
so
fast
by
her
own
enthusiasm
that
she
shall
not
wish
to
flee
said
ribas
you
must
entirely
intoxicate
her
with
your
humble
and
respectful
love
then
is
she
yours
does
she
know
i
am
coming
thoughtfully
asked
orloff
no
she
knows
nothing
of
it
she
sits
in
the
garden
and
sighs
occasionally
grasping
the
golden
guitar
that
lies
on
her
arm
and
asks
of
the
flowers
what
is
the
name
of
my
unknown
friend
in
what
star
does
he
dwell
and
how
shall
i
invoke
him
i
will
then
surprise
her
said
orloff
let
her
anticipate
my
coming
but
do
not
promise
it
it
begins
to
grow
dark
where
is
she
evenings
always
in
the
garden
there
she
sighs
and
dreams
of
you
persuade
her
to
go
into
the
house
and
let
it
be
well
lighted
up
i
would
appear
to
her
in
the
full
splendor
of
the
lights
ha
you
ragamuffins
you
hounds
bring
me
my
oriental
costume
the
richest
handsomest
hasten
or
i
will
throttle
you
and
count
orloff
hurried
into
his
to
the
trembling
slaves
who
there
awaited
him
with
a
sly
smile
joseph
ribas
returned
to
the
villa
as
he
had
previously
said
he
found
natalie
dreaming
in
the
garden
the
guitar
upon
her
arm
you
ought
to
go
into
the
house
this
evening
said
he
the
air
is
damp
and
cold
and
may
injure
of
what
consequence
would
that
be
she
sadly
responded
who
would
ask
whether
i
was
ill
nor
not
who
would
weep
for
my
death
he
oh
he
sighed
she
he
hates
all
women
excepting
you
whispered
ribas
princess
go
into
the
house
take
care
of
your
precious
life
it
is
not
i
who
beg
it
of
you
who
is
it
then
she
hastily
interposed
it
is
he
he
begs
it
of
you
natalie
springing
up
hurried
into
the
house
i
will
never
again
go
into
the
garden
in
the
evening
said
she
it
is
his
command
thank
god
there
is
yet
something
in
which
i
can
obey
and
he
commands
it
of
me
but
why
these
lights
asked
she
almost
blinded
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
girandoles
and
chandeliers
the
mirrors
and
jewels
the
count
has
so
commanded
said
ribas
he
loves
a
bright
light
but
princess
can
not
you
remain
in
this
boudoir
for
one
evening
only
see
how
beautiful
it
is
how
enticingly
cool
with
these
fountains
that
refresh
the
air
and
diffuse
fragrance
how
delightfully
still
and
snug
it
is
reposing
upon
these
velvet
cushions
you
can
look
through
the
whole
suite
of
rooms
which
in
fact
tonight
flash
and
sparkle
like
the
heavens
and
yet
in
this
boudoir
there
is
a
sweet
twilight
refreshing
to
eye
and
heart
no
no
said
she
with
a
charming
smile
i
also
like
brightness
and
light
it
is
too
dusky
here
nevertheless
remain
here
and
why
he
wishes
it
said
ribas
mysteriously
he
wishes
it
cried
natalie
turning
pale
and
trembling
then
suddenly
a
purple
flush
spread
over
her
brow
and
reeling
she
was
obliged
to
hold
by
a
chair
to
prevent
falling
ah
she
stammered
can
it
be
possible
can
this
happiness
be
intended
is
it
true
what
i
read
in
your
eyes
is
it
comes
he
here
hope
always
said
ribas
suddenly
disappearing
through
a
natalie
benumbed
by
surprise
sank
down
upon
the
divan
a
feeling
of
boundless
anxiety
of
immeasurable
ecstasy
suddenly
overcame
her
she
could
have
fled
but
she
felt
as
if
she
could
have
concealed
herself
from
him
and
yet
was
joyfully
ready
to
purchase
with
her
life
the
happiness
of
seeing
him
it
was
a
strange
mixture
of
delight
and
terror
of
happiness
and
despair
she
spread
her
arms
toward
heaven
she
sought
to
pray
but
she
had
no
words
no
thoughts
not
even
tears
a
slight
rustle
made
her
rise
almost
with
terror
flew
her
glance
through
the
suite
of
rooms
there
below
she
saw
the
approach
of
something
strange
singular
magical
it
was
a
form
but
surrounded
by
a
wonderfully
bright
halo
enveloped
in
rich
glittering
garments
such
as
she
had
never
before
seen
it
was
a
strange
unknown
face
but
of
a
sublime
heroic
beauty
proud
and
noble
bold
and
mild
that
is
he
she
breathlessly
and
sadly
murmured
yes
that
is
he
that
is
a
man
and
a
hero
ah
i
shall
die
under
his
glance
he
still
continued
to
approach
and
with
every
forward
step
he
made
she
felt
her
heart
contract
with
anxiety
admiration
and
a
feverish
sadness
now
he
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
boudoir
his
glance
fell
upon
her
and
she
she
lay
or
rather
half
knelt
upon
the
divan
motionless
pale
as
a
marble
statue
with
that
divine
smile
which
we
admire
in
ancient
sculpture
touching
was
she
to
behold
white
and
delicate
as
a
lily
so
humble
and
devoted
so
and
but
count
orloff
felt
neither
sympathy
nor
compassion
he
saw
only
that
she
was
beautiful
as
an
angel
an
admirable
woman
whom
he
desired
to
possess
proud
as
a
king
and
at
the
same
time
very
reverential
and
submissive
he
approached
and
sank
upon
his
knee
before
the
divan
upon
which
she
reclined
in
trembling
yet
blissful
sadness
princess
natalie
he
murmured
low
will
you
be
angry
with
your
slave
for
daring
to
intrude
upon
you
without
knowing
whether
he
would
be
welcome
she
breathed
freer
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
hear
his
voice
it
made
her
feel
easier
he
was
no
magician
no
demon
he
was
a
man
and
spoke
to
her
with
human
words
that
gave
her
courage
and
strength
it
gave
her
back
the
consciousness
of
her
own
dignity
she
was
ashamed
of
her
anxiety
her
trembling
her
childish
helplessness
yet
she
could
say
nothing
answer
nothing
she
only
gave
him
her
hand
and
with
a
charming
smile
an
inimitable
grace
and
welcomed
him
with
a
silent
inclination
of
the
head
taking
her
hand
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
his
touch
seemed
to
kindle
in
her
an
electric
glow
and
with
something
like
alarm
she
withdrew
her
hand
are
you
then
angry
with
me
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
sadness
no
said
she
i
am
not
angry
but
i
fear
you
you
are
so
great
a
hero
and
your
sword
has
done
so
many
brave
deeds
i
looked
at
your
sword
and
it
alarmed
count
orloff
gave
her
a
surprised
and
interrogating
glance
why
said
she
that
had
she
some
suspicion
some
mistrust
or
was
it
only
a
presentiment
an
inexplicable
instinct
that
made
her
tremble
at
his
sword
no
she
suspects
nothing
thought
he
as
he
gazed
upon
that
pure
innocent
childish
brow
which
was
turned
toward
him
in
pious
confidence
and
yet
with
timid
hesitation
he
loosened
his
sword
from
his
girdle
sparkling
with
diamonds
and
humbly
laid
both
at
natalie
s
feet
princess
said
he
the
empress
herself
girded
me
with
this
sword
and
i
swore
it
should
never
leave
my
side
but
with
my
life
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
my
life
or
my
honor
and
i
therefore
break
my
sacred
oath
take
my
sword
i
am
now
without
arms
and
you
will
no
longer
have
occasion
to
tremble
before
she
smilingly
shook
her
head
you
still
remain
a
hero
though
without
arms
it
lies
in
your
eyes
i
would
close
my
eyes
said
he
but
then
i
should
not
see
you
princess
and
i
have
already
so
long
languished
for
a
sight
of
you
why
then
came
you
not
sooner
she
asked
now
feeling
herself
entirely
cheerful
and
unembarrassed
oh
did
you
but
know
how
impatiently
i
have
awaited
you
and
with
childish
innocence
she
began
to
relate
how
much
she
had
thought
of
him
how
often
she
had
dreamed
of
him
how
she
had
sometimes
spoken
aloud
to
him
and
almost
thought
she
heard
his
answers
count
orloff
listened
to
her
with
surprise
and
delight
thus
had
he
not
expected
to
find
her
so
childishly
cheerful
so
charmingly
innocent
and
yet
at
the
same
time
with
so
much
maidenly
reserve
so
much
natural
dignity
now
she
laughed
like
a
child
now
was
her
face
serious
and
proud
now
again
tender
and
timid
she
was
at
once
a
timid
child
and
a
glowing
woman
she
was
innocent
as
an
angel
and
yet
so
full
of
sweet
unconscious
maiden
coquetry
she
enchanted
while
inspiring
devotion
she
excited
passions
and
desires
while
with
a
natural
maiden
dignity
she
kept
one
within
the
bounds
of
respect
she
was
entirely
different
from
what
orloff
had
expected
perhaps
less
beautiful
less
dazzling
but
infinitely
more
lovely
she
enchanted
him
with
her
smile
and
her
innocent
childish
face
touched
him
speak
on
speak
on
said
he
when
she
became
silent
it
is
delightful
to
listen
to
you
why
do
you
call
me
so
asked
she
with
a
slight
contraction
of
her
brow
it
is
such
a
strange
cold
word
it
does
not
at
all
belong
to
me
and
it
is
only
within
the
last
few
months
that
i
have
been
thus
addressed
with
wise
and
tender
forbearance
paulo
long
delayed
informing
me
that
i
was
a
princess
and
that
was
beautiful
in
him
to
be
a
princess
and
yet
an
orphan
a
poor
deserted
helpless
child
living
upon
the
charity
of
a
friend
and
tremulously
clinging
to
his
protecting
hand
see
that
is
what
i
am
a
poor
orphan
why
then
do
you
call
me
princess
because
you
are
so
in
reality
responded
orloff
pressing
the
hem
of
her
garment
to
his
lips
because
i
am
come
to
lead
you
to
your
splendid
and
powerful
future
because
i
will
glorify
you
above
all
women
on
earth
and
make
you
mistress
of
this
great
she
regarded
him
with
a
dreamy
smile
you
speak
as
paulo
often
spoke
to
me
said
she
he
also
swore
to
me
that
he
would
one
day
place
an
imperial
crown
upon
my
head
and
elevate
me
to
great
power
i
understood
him
as
little
as
i
understand
you
a
slight
scornful
smile
momentarily
passed
over
orloff
s
features
catharine
has
therefore
rightly
divined
thought
he
and
her
wise
mind
rightly
understood
this
rasczinsky
there
was
indeed
question
of
an
imperial
crown
and
this
was
to
have
been
the
new
little
empress
aloud
he
said
you
will
soon
understand
me
princess
and
it
is
time
you
knew
of
what
crown
paulo
i
know
it
not
said
she
nor
do
i
desire
to
know
it
perhaps
it
was
a
jest
with
which
he
sought
to
console
me
when
i
complained
of
being
a
homeless
orphan
a
poor
child
who
knew
not
even
the
name
of
her
mother
do
you
not
know
that
exclaimed
orloff
with
astonishment
she
sadly
shook
her
head
they
would
never
tell
it
me
said
she
but
i
have
her
image
in
my
heart
and
that
at
least
i
shall
never
lose
or
forget
i
knew
your
mother
said
orloff
she
was
beautiful
as
you
are
and
mild
and
you
knew
her
exclaimed
the
young
maiden
grasping
his
hand
and
looking
at
him
with
a
confiding
friendliness
oh
you
knew
her
you
will
now
be
doubly
dear
to
me
for
those
bright
eyes
have
seen
my
mother
and
perhaps
this
hand
which
now
rests
in
mine
has
also
touched
hers
that
said
count
orloff
with
a
smile
i
should
not
have
dared
to
do
it
would
have
been
was
she
then
so
great
a
sublime
a
princess
asked
natalie
she
was
an
empress
an
empress
and
the
young
maiden
sprang
up
with
beaming
eyes
and
glowing
cheeks
my
mother
was
an
empress
said
she
breathing
hard
empress
elizabeth
of
overcome
by
the
feelings
suddenly
excited
by
this
news
natalie
sank
again
upon
her
seat
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
tears
gushed
out
between
her
delicate
slender
fingers
her
whole
being
was
in
violent
feverish
commotion
then
raising
her
arms
toward
heaven
with
a
celestial
smile
while
the
tears
overflowed
her
face
she
said
i
am
then
no
longer
a
homeless
orphan
i
have
a
fatherland
and
my
mother
was
an
empress
count
orloff
respectfully
kissed
the
hem
of
her
garment
you
are
the
daughter
of
an
empress
said
he
and
will
yourself
be
an
empress
that
was
what
paulo
wished
and
therefore
have
they
condemned
him
as
a
criminal
what
he
was
unable
to
accomplish
must
be
done
by
me
and
for
that
purpose
have
i
come
princess
natalie
your
fatherland
calls
you
your
throne
awaits
you
follow
me
to
your
crowning
in
the
city
of
your
fathers
follow
me
that
i
may
place
the
crown
of
your
grandfather
peter
the
great
upon
your
noble
and
beautiful
head
the
warning
from
this
time
forward
alexis
orloff
was
the
inseparable
companion
of
natalie
with
the
most
reverential
submission
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
tenderest
affection
seemed
he
to
be
devoted
to
her
and
equally
to
adore
her
as
his
empress
and
his
beloved
he
took
pains
to
represent
to
her
that
she
was
necessarily
and
inevitably
destined
to
become
an
empress
and
she
had
comprehended
him
but
too
well
ambition
was
awakened
in
this
young
maiden
of
eighteen
years
it
was
an
imperial
crown
that
called
her
why
should
she
not
listen
to
this
call
coming
from
the
lips
of
one
in
whom
she
had
unlimited
confidence
and
toward
whom
she
felt
infinitely
grateful
he
had
unfolded
and
explained
all
to
her
he
had
told
her
of
her
mother
the
good
empress
elizabeth
who
had
made
russia
so
great
and
happy
he
had
explained
to
her
how
count
paulo
rasczinsky
had
flown
with
her
on
the
day
of
her
mother
s
death
in
order
to
preserve
her
from
the
pursuits
of
her
mother
s
successor
the
cunning
and
cruel
peter
and
to
insure
to
her
the
realm
at
a
later
period
he
had
then
spoken
to
her
of
catharine
who
had
forcibly
possessed
herself
of
the
throne
of
her
unworthy
husband
and
taken
the
reins
of
government
into
her
own
hands
he
had
spoken
to
her
of
catharine
s
cruelty
and
despotic
tyranny
he
had
told
her
that
all
russia
groaned
under
the
oppression
of
this
foreigner
and
that
a
universal
cry
was
heard
through
the
whole
realm
of
lamentation
and
longing
a
cry
for
her
the
russian
princess
the
of
peter
the
great
the
daughter
of
the
beloved
elizabeth
you
are
called
for
by
all
these
millions
of
your
oppressed
subjects
now
trodden
in
the
dust
said
he
toward
you
they
stretch
forth
their
trembling
hands
from
you
they
expect
relief
and
consolation
from
you
they
expect
happiness
and
i
will
bring
them
happiness
exclaimed
natalie
with
emotion
i
will
dry
the
tears
of
misery
and
console
the
suffering
oh
my
people
shall
love
me
as
my
mother
once
did
the
noblest
of
the
land
have
pledged
their
property
and
their
lives
to
give
you
back
to
your
people
said
orloff
we
have
solemnly
sworn
it
upon
the
altar
of
god
and
for
the
attainment
of
this
end
no
one
of
us
will
shun
want
or
death
treason
or
revolt
look
at
me
natalie
i
stand
before
you
a
traitor
to
this
empress
to
whom
i
have
sworn
faith
and
obedience
she
has
heaped
favors
upon
me
and
at
one
time
i
was
even
passionately
devoted
to
her
but
count
paulo
awoke
me
from
that
intoxication
he
roused
me
from
the
condition
of
a
favorite
of
the
empress
he
taught
me
to
see
the
cruel
bloodthirsty
empress
in
her
true
form
he
spoke
to
me
of
your
sacred
rights
and
when
i
recognized
and
comprehended
them
i
collected
myself
vowed
myself
your
knight
devoting
myself
to
the
defence
of
your
rights
and
swore
to
leave
no
artifices
no
dissimulation
nor
even
treason
itself
unessayed
for
the
promotion
of
this
great
this
sublime
object
princess
natalie
for
your
sake
i
have
become
a
traitor
the
admiral
of
the
russian
fleet
he
whom
the
world
calls
the
favorite
of
the
empress
count
alexis
orloff
lies
at
your
feet
and
swears
to
you
eternal
faith
devotion
and
adoration
alexis
orloff
she
joyfully
exclaimed
at
length
then
i
have
a
name
by
which
i
can
call
you
alexis
was
not
that
the
name
of
my
father
oh
that
is
a
good
omen
you
bear
the
name
of
my
father
whom
my
mother
so
dearly
loved
and
whom
the
empress
impelled
by
love
raised
to
the
position
of
her
husband
whispered
orloff
bending
nearer
to
her
and
pressing
her
hand
to
his
bosom
could
you
indeed
love
as
warmly
and
devotedly
as
your
mother
loved
her
alexis
the
young
maiden
blushed
and
trembled
but
a
sweet
smile
played
upon
her
lips
and
although
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
did
not
look
at
him
yet
count
orloff
saw
that
he
had
given
no
offence
and
might
venture
still
further
he
gently
encircled
her
delicate
form
with
his
arm
and
inclining
his
mouth
so
close
to
her
ear
that
she
felt
his
hot
breath
upon
her
cheek
whispered
will
natalie
love
her
alexis
as
elizabeth
loved
alexis
razumovsky
ah
you
know
not
how
boundlessly
how
immeasurably
i
love
you
yes
immeasurably
natalie
you
are
my
happiness
my
life
my
future
command
me
rule
me
make
of
me
a
traitor
a
murderer
i
will
do
whatever
you
command
at
your
desire
i
could
even
murder
my
own
father
only
tell
me
natalie
that
you
do
not
hate
me
tell
me
that
my
love
will
not
be
rejected
by
you
that
this
passion
under
which
i
almost
succumb
has
found
an
echo
in
your
heart
and
that
you
will
one
day
say
to
me
as
elizabeth
said
to
your
father
alexis
i
love
you
and
will
therefore
make
you
my
husband
you
are
silent
natalie
have
you
no
word
of
sympathy
of
compassion
for
me
ah
i
offer
up
all
to
you
and
you
he
could
proceed
no
further
he
saw
her
turn
toward
him
he
suddenly
felt
a
glowing
kiss
upon
his
lips
and
then
springing
up
from
her
seat
she
fled
through
the
rooms
like
a
frightened
roe
and
took
refuge
in
her
boudoir
which
she
locked
behind
her
orloff
glanced
after
her
with
a
triumphant
smile
she
is
mine
thought
he
i
am
here
living
through
a
charming
romance
and
catharine
will
be
satisfied
with
me
yes
she
was
his
she
now
knew
that
she
loved
him
and
with
joyful
ecstasy
she
took
this
new
and
delightful
feeling
to
her
heart
she
welcomed
it
as
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
a
precious
new
life
she
permitted
this
feeling
to
stream
through
her
whole
being
her
whole
soul
she
made
it
a
worship
for
her
whole
existence
you
see
she
said
to
marianne
so
had
i
dreamed
the
man
whom
i
should
one
day
love
so
brave
so
proud
so
beautiful
ah
it
is
so
charming
to
be
obliged
to
tremble
before
the
man
one
loves
it
is
so
sweet
to
cling
to
him
and
think
i
am
nothing
of
myself
but
all
through
thee
i
am
the
ivy
and
thou
the
oak
thou
wilt
hold
and
sustain
me
and
if
a
comes
thou
wilt
not
waver
but
stand
firm
and
great
in
thy
heroic
strength
and
protect
me
and
impart
courage
and
confidence
even
to
me
she
loved
him
and
clung
to
him
with
boundless
confidence
but
she
was
yet
so
full
of
tender
maiden
timidity
that
she
could
confess
to
him
nothing
of
this
love
and
since
that
kiss
she
shyly
avoided
him
and
constantly
left
his
unanswered
at
this
alexis
secretly
laughed
she
will
come
round
said
he
she
will
finally
be
compelled
to
it
by
her
own
feelings
i
will
give
her
time
and
leisure
to
come
to
a
knowledge
of
herself
and
for
some
days
he
kept
away
from
the
villa
pretending
pressing
business
and
left
the
poor
isolated
princess
to
her
languishing
it
was
precisely
in
these
days
that
on
one
forenoon
a
carriage
of
indifferent
appearance
adorned
with
no
heraldic
arms
stopped
before
the
villa
a
man
closely
enveloped
in
a
mantle
his
hat
pressed
deeply
down
over
his
forehead
issued
from
the
carriage
and
rang
the
bell
of
the
servant
who
answered
the
bell
he
hastily
inquired
if
the
princess
was
at
home
and
alone
these
questions
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
the
servant
having
asked
his
name
in
order
to
announce
him
the
stranger
said
almost
in
a
commanding
tone
the
princess
knows
my
name
and
will
gladly
welcome
me
therefore
lead
me
directly
to
her
the
princess
receives
no
one
said
the
servant
placing
himself
in
a
position
to
prevent
the
stranger
s
entrance
she
will
receive
me
said
the
unknown
dropping
some
into
the
servant
s
hand
i
will
conduct
you
to
her
said
the
suddenly
mollified
servant
but
i
do
it
on
your
own
princess
natalie
was
in
her
boudoir
she
was
alone
and
thinking
in
a
languishing
reverie
of
her
friend
who
had
now
been
two
days
absent
on
hearing
a
light
knock
at
the
door
she
sprang
up
from
her
seat
it
is
he
she
murmured
and
with
glowing
cheeks
she
hastened
to
the
door
but
on
finding
there
a
strange
and
form
natalie
timidly
drew
back
the
stranger
entered
closing
the
door
behind
him
threw
back
his
mantle
and
took
off
the
hat
that
shaded
his
face
cardinal
bernis
cried
natalie
with
surprise
ah
then
you
yet
recognize
me
princess
said
bernis
that
is
beautiful
in
you
and
therefore
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
for
calling
upon
you
unannounced
i
knew
that
i
should
find
you
alone
and
this
was
a
too
fortunate
circumstance
for
me
to
let
it
pass
unimproved
i
must
speak
to
you
princess
even
at
the
hazard
of
proving
natalie
said
with
a
soft
smile
you
were
the
friend
of
count
paulo
and
therefore
can
never
prove
tiresome
to
me
i
bid
you
welcome
cardinal
it
is
precisely
because
i
was
count
paulo
s
friend
that
i
have
come
said
bernis
seriously
the
count
loved
you
princess
and
what
i
did
not
know
at
the
time
is
known
to
me
now
because
he
loved
and
was
devoted
to
you
he
hazarded
his
life
and
more
than
his
life
his
and
they
have
robbed
him
of
that
precious
liberty
sighed
natalie
for
his
fidelity
to
me
they
have
condemned
him
to
a
shameful
imprisonment
you
know
that
exclaimed
bernis
with
astonishment
you
know
that
and
nevertheless
then
interrupting
himself
he
broke
off
and
after
a
pause
continued
pardon
me
one
question
and
if
you
deem
it
indiscreet
please
remember
that
it
is
put
to
you
by
an
old
man
and
a
priest
and
that
his
only
object
is
if
possible
to
be
useful
to
you
do
you
love
count
paulo
rasczinksy
i
love
him
said
she
as
one
loves
a
father
i
shall
always
be
grateful
to
him
and
shall
never
esteem
myself
happy
until
i
have
liberated
him
and
restored
him
to
his
country
you
liberate
him
sadly
exclaimed
bernis
ah
then
you
know
not
you
do
not
once
dream
that
you
are
yourself
surrounded
by
dangers
that
your
own
liberty
indeed
your
life
itself
is
i
know
it
calmly
responded
the
young
maiden
but
i
also
know
that
strong
and
powerful
friends
stand
by
my
side
who
will
protect
and
defend
me
with
their
but
how
if
these
friends
are
deceiving
you
if
precisely
they
are
your
bitterest
enemies
and
destroyers
sir
cardinal
exclaimed
natalie
reddening
with
indignation
oh
i
may
not
anger
you
he
continued
but
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
princess
they
have
undoubtedly
deceived
you
with
false
pretensions
and
in
some
deceitful
way
obtained
your
confidence
tell
me
princess
do
you
know
the
name
of
this
count
whom
you
daily
receive
here
it
is
count
alexis
orloff
said
the
young
maiden
blushing
you
know
him
know
his
name
and
yet
you
confide
in
him
exclaimed
the
cardinal
but
it
can
not
be
that
you
know
his
history
have
you
any
idea
to
whom
he
is
indebted
for
his
prosperity
and
greatness
the
empress
catharine
his
mistress
said
natalie
without
embarrassment
the
cardinal
looked
with
increasing
astonishment
into
her
calm
smiling
face
i
now
comprehend
it
all
he
then
said
they
have
laid
a
very
shrewd
and
cunning
plan
they
have
deceived
you
while
telling
you
a
part
of
the
truth
no
one
has
deceived
me
indignantly
responded
natalie
i
tell
you
sir
cardinal
that
i
am
neither
deceived
nor
overreached
easy
as
you
seem
to
think
it
to
deceive
me
oh
it
is
always
easy
to
deceive
innocence
and
nobleness
sadly
remarked
the
cardinal
listen
to
me
princess
and
think
i
conjure
you
that
this
time
a
true
and
sincere
friend
is
speaking
to
and
how
shall
i
recognize
that
asked
the
young
maiden
with
a
slight
touch
of
irony
how
shall
i
recognize
a
friend
when
as
you
say
it
is
precisely
my
pretended
friends
who
are
my
enemies
recognize
me
by
this
said
the
cardinal
drawing
a
folded
paper
from
his
bosom
and
handing
it
to
the
princess
that
is
count
paulo
s
handwriting
she
joyfully
exclaimed
ah
you
recognize
the
handwriting
said
the
cardinal
and
you
see
that
this
letter
is
addressed
to
me
count
paulo
therefore
considers
me
his
friend
may
i
read
this
letter
i
beg
you
to
do
natalie
unfolded
the
letter
and
read
warn
the
princess
tartaroff
danger
threatens
her
that
is
all
she
asked
with
a
smile
that
is
all
said
the
cardinal
but
when
paulo
considered
these
few
words
of
sufficient
importance
to
send
them
to
me
you
may
well
suppose
they
are
of
the
utmost
count
paulo
is
in
siberia
said
natalie
shaking
her
head
how
could
he
have
written
you
from
thence
how
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
i
know
not
but
the
firm
determined
will
of
man
often
conquers
supposed
impossibilities
enough
in
a
mysterious
enigmatical
manner
was
this
letter
put
into
the
hands
of
our
ambassador
at
petersburg
with
the
most
urgent
prayer
that
he
would
immediately
send
it
to
me
by
a
special
courier
with
all
the
necessary
and
was
that
done
asked
natalie
it
was
done
i
know
why
your
life
is
threatened
princess
tartaroff
you
are
the
daughter
of
the
empress
elizabeth
and
therefore
it
is
that
this
empress
catharine
upon
her
usurped
throne
trembles
with
fear
of
you
therefore
was
it
that
she
said
to
her
favorite
go
and
deliver
me
from
this
troublesome
pretender
but
do
it
in
a
sly
cautious
and
noiseless
manner
avoid
attracting
attention
murder
her
not
threaten
her
not
i
wish
not
to
give
people
new
reasons
for
calling
me
a
bloodthirsty
woman
entice
her
with
flatteries
into
our
net
induce
her
to
follow
you
voluntarily
that
the
people
of
no
country
in
which
she
may
be
may
have
an
occasion
to
accuse
us
of
using
thus
did
catharine
speak
to
her
favorite
he
understood
her
and
swore
to
execute
her
commands
as
he
did
when
catharine
ordered
him
to
throttle
her
husband
the
emperor
peter
as
he
also
did
when
she
ordered
him
to
shoot
poor
ivan
the
son
of
anna
leopoldowna
for
the
criminal
reason
that
he
had
a
greater
right
to
the
imperial
crown
of
russia
than
this
little
german
princess
of
zerbst
and
he
shot
that
poor
innocent
ivan
shudderingly
asked
natalie
ah
this
catharine
is
bloodthirsty
as
a
hyena
and
her
friends
and
favorites
are
hangmen
s
servants
ah
history
will
brand
this
murderer
of
ivan
it
will
solemnly
responded
cardinal
bernis
and
people
will
shudder
when
they
hear
the
name
of
the
man
who
strangled
the
emperor
peter
who
shot
ivan
and
who
at
the
command
of
catharine
has
come
to
italy
to
ensnare
the
noble
and
innocent
princess
tartaroff
with
cunning
and
flatteries
and
convey
her
to
petersburg
shall
i
tell
you
this
man
s
name
he
is
called
alexis
orloff
the
young
maiden
sprang
up
from
her
seat
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
cheeks
glowed
that
is
false
said
she
a
shameful
malicious
falsehood
would
to
god
it
were
so
cried
the
cardinal
but
it
is
too
true
princess
oh
listen
to
me
and
close
not
your
ears
to
the
truth
remember
that
i
am
an
old
man
who
has
long
observed
men
and
long
studied
life
i
know
this
russian
diplomacy
and
this
russian
craft
they
have
in
them
something
devilish
and
these
russian
diplomatists
they
poison
and
confound
the
shrewdest
with
their
deceitful
smiles
and
infernal
cunning
guard
yourself
princess
against
this
russian
diplomacy
and
above
all
things
be
on
your
guard
against
this
ambassador
of
the
russian
empress
alexis
orloff
ah
you
dare
to
defame
him
cried
the
young
maiden
trembling
with
anger
you
have
therefore
never
seen
him
you
have
never
read
in
his
noble
face
that
count
alexis
orloff
can
never
betray
he
is
a
hero
and
a
hero
never
descends
to
a
murder
ah
if
the
whole
world
should
rise
up
against
him
if
it
should
point
the
finger
at
him
and
say
that
is
a
murderer
i
would
cry
in
the
face
of
the
whole
world
thou
liest
alexis
orloff
can
never
be
a
murderer
i
know
him
better
and
know
that
he
is
pure
and
clear
of
every
crime
you
may
continue
to
call
him
a
betrayer
i
know
why
he
suffers
himself
to
be
so
called
i
know
the
secret
of
his
conduct
and
a
day
will
come
when
you
will
all
learn
it
when
you
will
all
feel
compelled
to
fall
down
at
his
feet
and
confess
alexis
orloff
is
no
false
betrayer
for
the
sake
of
her
to
whom
he
has
vowed
fidelity
has
he
borne
this
shame
for
her
whom
he
loved
has
he
staked
his
blood
and
his
life
alexis
orloff
is
a
hero
she
was
strangely
beautiful
while
speaking
with
such
spirit
and
animation
the
cardinal
observed
her
noble
and
excited
features
with
an
admiration
mingled
with
the
most
painful
emotions
poor
child
he
murmured
dropping
his
head
poor
child
she
loves
him
and
is
therefore
lost
you
then
do
not
believe
me
he
asked
aloud
no
said
she
with
a
glad
smile
no
all
the
happiness
i
ever
expect
all
the
good
that
may
hereafter
come
to
me
i
shall
receive
only
from
the
hands
of
alexis
orloff
poor
child
sighed
the
cardinal
in
many
a
case
even
death
may
prove
a
blessing
then
will
i
also
joyfully
receive
even
that
from
his
hands
cried
the
young
maiden
with
enthusiasm
it
is
in
vain
she
is
not
to
be
helped
murmured
the
cardinal
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
and
grasping
the
hand
of
the
young
maiden
with
a
compassionate
glance
at
her
fair
face
he
continued
i
would
gladly
aid
you
and
thereby
expiate
the
evil
you
once
suffered
at
my
festival
but
you
will
not
consent
to
be
aided
you
rush
to
your
destruction
and
it
is
your
noblest
qualities
your
innocence
and
your
generous
confidence
which
are
preparing
your
ruin
may
god
bless
you
and
preserve
you
how
glad
i
should
be
to
find
myself
a
liar
and
false
prophet
and
you
will
so
find
yourself
exclaimed
natalie
you
believe
it
because
you
are
in
love
and
when
a
woman
loves
she
believes
in
the
object
of
her
love
and
smilingly
offers
up
her
life
for
him
like
all
women
you
will
do
so
you
will
sacrifice
your
life
to
your
love
and
when
this
barbarian
thrusts
the
dagger
in
your
heart
you
will
say
with
a
smile
i
did
it
i
myself
and
bowing
to
her
with
a
sad
smile
slowly
and
sighing
the
cardinal
left
the
room
some
hours
later
came
alexis
orloff
natalie
received
him
with
an
expression
of
the
purest
pleasure
and
extending
both
hands
to
him
smilingly
said
know
you
yet
what
my
mother
said
to
her
lover
looking
at
her
he
read
his
happiness
in
her
face
with
an
exclamation
of
ecstasy
he
fell
at
her
feet
i
know
it
well
but
you
natalie
do
you
also
know
it
he
passionately
asked
natalie
smiled
alexis
said
she
i
love
you
and
therefore
will
i
raise
you
to
my
side
as
my
husband
and
with
a
charming
modest
blush
she
drew
the
count
up
to
her
arms
you
do
not
deceive
me
and
this
is
no
dream
he
cried
while
glowingly
embracing
her
no
said
she
it
is
the
truth
and
i
owe
you
this
satisfaction
you
have
been
slandered
to
me
ah
they
shall
see
how
little
i
believe
them
alexis
call
a
priest
to
bless
our
union
and
make
me
your
wife
whatever
then
may
come
we
will
share
it
with
each
other
if
i
am
one
day
empress
you
will
be
the
emperor
and
i
will
always
honor
and
obey
you
as
my
lord
and
on
the
evening
of
this
day
a
very
serious
and
solemn
ceremony
took
place
in
the
boudoir
of
princess
natalie
an
altar
wreathed
with
flowers
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
before
the
altar
stood
natalie
in
a
white
satin
robe
the
upon
her
head
the
long
bridal
veil
waving
around
her
delicate
form
she
was
very
beautiful
in
her
joyful
modest
emotion
and
count
alexis
orloff
who
in
a
rich
russian
costume
stood
by
her
side
viewed
her
with
ecstatic
and
warm
desiring
glances
the
inhuman
executioner
led
the
lamb
to
the
slaughter
without
pity
or
compunction
at
the
other
side
of
the
altar
stood
the
priest
a
reverend
old
man
with
long
flowing
silver
hair
and
beard
near
him
the
sacristan
not
less
reverend
in
appearance
no
one
else
was
present
except
marianne
who
in
tears
knelt
behind
her
mistress
and
with
folded
hands
prayed
for
her
beloved
princess
who
was
now
marrying
count
alexis
orloff
the
solemn
ceremony
was
at
an
end
and
the
young
wife
sank
weeping
into
the
arms
of
her
husband
who
with
tenderest
whisperings
led
her
into
the
next
room
marianne
overcome
by
her
tears
and
emotions
hastened
to
her
own
room
and
the
reverend
priest
remained
alone
with
his
sacristan
they
silently
looked
at
each
other
and
their
faces
were
distorted
by
a
knavish
grinning
laugh
it
was
a
wonderful
scene
said
the
priest
who
was
no
other
than
joseph
ribas
in
earnest
i
was
quite
affected
by
it
myself
and
i
came
near
weeping
at
my
own
sublime
homily
confess
stephano
that
a
consecrated
priest
could
not
have
better
gone
through
the
we
have
both
performed
our
parts
simpered
stephano
the
sacristan
and
i
think
the
count
must
be
satisfied
with
at
that
moment
the
count
returned
to
the
room
natalie
had
begged
to
be
left
alone
she
needed
solitude
and
prayer
the
priest
joseph
ribas
and
the
sacristan
stephano
gave
him
sly
interrogating
glances
i
am
satisfied
with
you
said
orloff
with
a
smile
you
are
both
excellent
actors
this
new
little
countess
was
pleased
and
touched
by
your
discourse
joseph
my
very
worthy
priest
where
did
you
learn
this
new
villainy
in
the
high
school
of
the
galleys
your
excellency
said
ribas
only
there
is
one
taught
such
precious
things
we
had
a
priest
there
a
real
consecrated
priest
who
was
sentenced
for
life
from
he
gave
lessons
to
the
smartest
among
us
in
his
art
and
taught
us
how
to
fold
the
hands
roll
the
eyes
and
render
the
voice
tremulous
but
now
your
excellency
one
thing
you
desired
to
know
who
it
was
that
warned
your
princess
i
can
now
give
you
information
on
that
point
it
was
the
french
cardinal
bernis
they
are
therefore
beginning
to
observe
our
movements
thoughtfully
remarked
orloff
and
these
gentlemen
diplomatists
wish
to
take
a
hand
in
the
game
ah
we
understand
the
french
policy
it
is
the
same
now
that
it
was
when
they
helped
to
make
the
princess
elizabeth
empress
at
that
time
they
interposed
that
russia
might
be
so
occupied
with
her
own
affairs
as
to
have
no
time
for
looking
into
those
of
france
precisely
so
is
it
they
would
compassionate
the
daughter
as
they
did
the
mother
with
the
help
of
natalie
they
would
again
bless
russia
with
a
revolution
that
we
might
not
have
time
to
observe
the
events
now
fermenting
in
france
but
this
time
we
shall
be
more
cautious
my
shrewd
french
cardinal
stephano
let
every
preparation
be
made
for
our
immediate
departure
we
are
no
longer
safe
and
unobserved
here
therefore
we
will
go
to
we
alone
or
with
the
princess
asked
stephano
my
wife
will
naturally
accompany
me
said
orloff
with
a
derisive
smile
will
she
consent
to
leave
rome
asked
joseph
ribas
i
shall
request
her
to
do
so
proudly
replied
orloff
and
i
think
my
request
will
be
a
command
to
and
the
proud
count
was
not
mistaken
his
request
was
a
command
for
her
he
told
her
she
must
leave
rome
because
she
was
no
longer
in
safety
there
and
princess
natalie
believed
him
we
will
go
to
leghorn
and
there
await
the
arrival
of
the
russian
fleet
said
he
when
that
fleet
shall
have
safely
arrived
then
our
ends
will
be
attained
then
we
shall
have
conquered
for
then
it
will
be
evident
that
the
empress
has
conceived
no
suspicion
and
i
am
the
commander
of
that
fleet
which
is
wholly
manned
with
conspirators
who
all
await
you
as
their
empress
will
you
follow
me
to
leghorn
natalie
she
clung
with
tender
submissiveness
to
his
bosom
i
will
follow
you
everywhere
murmured
she
and
any
place
to
which
you
conduct
me
will
be
a
paradise
for
me
the
russian
fleet
unsuspectingly
had
she
followed
orloff
to
leghorn
full
of
devoted
tenderness
full
of
glowing
love
she
was
only
anxious
to
fulfil
all
his
wishes
and
to
constantly
afford
him
new
proofs
of
her
affection
and
how
did
he
not
deserve
that
love
was
he
not
constantly
paying
her
the
most
delicate
attentions
was
he
not
always
as
humbly
submissive
as
he
was
tender
did
it
not
seem
as
if
the
lion
was
subdued
that
the
hercules
was
tamed
by
his
tender
omphale
whom
he
adored
at
whose
feet
he
lay
for
the
purpose
of
looking
into
her
eyes
to
read
in
them
her
most
secret
thoughts
and
wishes
she
was
not
only
his
wife
she
was
also
his
empress
such
he
called
her
as
such
he
respected
her
and
surrounded
her
with
more
than
imperial
splendor
the
house
of
the
english
consul
dyke
was
changed
into
an
imperial
palace
for
natalie
and
the
young
and
beautiful
wife
of
the
consul
was
her
first
lady
of
honor
she
established
a
court
for
the
young
imperial
princess
she
surrounded
her
with
numerous
servants
and
a
splendid
train
of
attendants
whose
duty
it
was
to
follow
the
illustrious
young
empress
everywhere
and
never
to
leave
her
and
natalie
suspected
not
that
this
english
consul
received
from
the
empress
of
russia
a
million
of
silver
rubles
and
that
his
wife
was
rewarded
with
a
costly
set
of
brilliants
for
the
hospitality
shown
to
this
russian
princess
which
was
so
well
calculated
to
deceive
not
only
natalie
herself
but
also
the
european
courts
whose
attention
had
been
aroused
natalie
suspected
not
that
her
splendid
train
her
numerous
servants
that
all
these
who
apparently
viewed
her
as
their
sublime
mistress
were
really
nothing
more
than
spies
and
jailors
who
watched
her
every
step
her
every
word
her
every
glance
poor
child
she
suspected
nothing
they
honored
and
treated
her
as
an
empress
and
she
believed
them
smiling
with
delight
when
the
people
of
leghorn
whenever
she
with
her
splendid
retinue
appeared
at
her
husband
s
side
shouted
with
every
demonstration
of
respect
for
her
as
an
empress
and
finally
one
day
the
russian
fleet
arrived
radiant
with
joy
alexis
orloff
rushed
into
natalie
s
apartment
we
have
now
attained
our
end
said
he
dropping
upon
one
knee
before
his
wife
i
can
now
in
truth
greet
you
as
my
empress
and
mistress
natalie
the
russian
fleet
is
here
and
only
waits
to
convey
you
in
triumph
to
your
empire
to
the
throne
that
is
ready
for
you
to
your
people
who
are
languishing
for
your
presence
ah
you
are
now
really
an
empress
and
marvellous
will
you
be
when
the
imperial
crown
encircles
your
noble
head
i
shall
be
an
empress
said
natalie
but
you
alexis
will
always
be
my
lord
and
emperor
natalie
continued
the
count
your
people
call
for
you
your
soldiers
languish
for
you
the
sailors
of
all
these
ships
direct
their
eyes
to
the
shore
where
their
empress
lingers
the
admiral
s
ship
will
be
splendidly
adorned
for
your
reception
and
admiral
gluck
will
be
the
first
to
pay
homage
to
you
therefore
adorn
yourself

charming
beautiful
empress

all
the
magnificence
of
your

wonderful
and
intoxicating
festival
when

celebrate
the
first
day
of
your
greatness
and
count
orloff
called
her
attendants
smiling
perfectly
happy
at
seeing
the
pleasure
and
satisfaction
of
her
husband
natalie
suffered
herself
to
be
adorned
to
be
enveloped
in
that
costly
robe
those
pearls
and
diamonds
that
sparkling
diadem
those
chains
and
bracelets
she
was
dressed
she
was
ready
with
a
charming
smile
she
gave
her
hand
to
her
husband
who
viewed
her
with
joyous
glances
and
loudly
praised
the
beauty
of
her
celestial
countenance
they
will
be
enchanted
with
the
sight
of
you
said
he
natalie
smilingly
said
let
them
be
so
i
am
only
happy
when
i
please
you
in
an
open
carriage
attended
by
her
retinue
she
proceeded
to
the
haven
and
all
the
people
who
thronged
the
streets
shouted
in
honor
of
the
beautiful
princess
astonished
at
the
splendor
by
which
she
was
surrounded
and
estimating
count
orloff
a
very
happy
man
to
be
the
husband
of
such
an
empress
and
when
she
appeared
upon
the
shore
when
the
carriages
stopped
and
princess
natalie
rose
from
her
seat
there
arose
from
all
the
ships
the
cheers
of
their
crews
russian
flags
waved
from
every
spar
cannon
thundered
and
drums
rolled
and
all
shouted
hail
to
the
imperial
princess
hail
natalie
the
daughter
of
elizabeth
it
was
a
proud
an
intoxicating
moment
and
natalie
s
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
trembling
with
proud
ecstasy
she
was
compelled
to
lean
upon
orloff
s
arm
to
preserve
herself
from
falling
no
weakness
now
said
he
and
for
the
first
time
his
voice
sounded
harsh
and
rough
surprised
she
glanced
at
him
there
was
something
in
his
face
that
she
did
not
understand
there
was
something
wild
and
disagreeable
in
the
expression
of
his
features
and
he
avoided
meeting
her
glance
he
looked
over
to
the
ships
see
said
he
they
are
letting
down
the
great
boat
admiral
gluck
himself
is
coming
for
you
and
see
that
host
of
gondolas
that
follow
the
admiral
s
boat
all
his
officers
are
coming
to
do
homage
to
you
and
when
you
in
their
company
reach
the
admiral
s
ship
they
will
let
down
the
golden
to
take
you
on
board
that
is
an
honor
they
pay
only
to
persons
of
imperial
rank
her
glance
passed
by
all
these
unimportant
things
she
saw
only
his
face
she
thoughtfully
and
sadly
asked
herself
what
change
had
come
over
alexis
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
his
appearance
the
boats
came
to
the
shore
and
now
came
the
admiral
with
his
officers
prostrating
themselves
before
her
they
paid
homage
to
this
beautiful
princess
whom
they
hailed
as
their
mistress
natalie
thanked
them
with
a
fascinating
smile
and
graciously
giving
her
hand
to
the
admiral
suffered
herself
to
be
assisted
by
him
into
the
great
boat
as
soon
as
her
foot
touched
it
the
cannon
thundered
flags
were
waved
on
all
the
ships
and
their
crews
shouted
viva
natalie
of
russia
her
eyes
sought
orloff
who
with
a
scowling
brow
and
gloomy
features
was
still
standing
on
the
shore
count
alexis
orloff
cried
she
with
her
silvery
voice
we
await
you
but
alexis
came
not
at
her
call
he
hastily
sprang
into
an
officer
s
boat
without
giving
her
even
a
look
alexis
she
anxiously
cried
he
follows
us
your
highness
whispered
the
wife
of
consul
dyke
while
taking
her
place
near
the
princess
it
would
be
contrary
to
etiquette
for
him
to
appear
at
the
side
of
the
empress
at
this
moment
see
he
is
close
behind
us
in
the
second
gondola
shove
off
cried
admiral
gluck
he
himself
taking
the
rudder
in
honor
of
the
empress
the
boats
moved
from
the
land
first
the
admiral
s
boat
with
the
princess
the
admiral
and
the
englishwoman
and
then
in
brilliant
array
the
innumerable
crowd
of
adorned
gondolas
containing
the
officers
of
the
fleet
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
the
people
who
crowded
the
shore
could
not
sufficiently
admire
the
splendid
spectacle
when
they
reached
the
admiral
s
ship
the
was
let
down
for
natalie
s
reception
she
tremblingly
rose
from
her
seat
a
strange
inexplicable
fear
came
over
her
and
she
anxiously
glanced
around
for
orloff
he
sat
in
the
second
boat
not
far
from
her
but
he
looked
not
toward
her
not
even
for
a
moment
and
upon
his
lips
there
was
a
wild
triumphant
smile
princess
they
wait
for
you
seat
yourself
in
the
said
madame
dyke
in
a
tone
which
to
natalie
seemed
to
have
nothing
of
the
former
humility
and
devotion
all
seemed
to
her
to
be
suddenly
changed
all
shudderingly
she
took
her
seat
in
the
swinging
chair
but
nevertheless
she
took
it
the
chair
was
drawn
up
the
cannon
thundered
anew
the
flags
were
waved
and
again
shouted
the
masses
of
people
on
the
shore
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
amid
the
shouts
of
joy
and
the
thundering
of
the
cannon
a
shriek
of
terror
was
heard
loud
penetrating
and
heartrending
what
was
that
what
means
the
tumult
upon
the
deck
of
the
admiral
s
ship
seems
it
not
as
if
they
had
roughly
seized
this
princess
whose
feet
had
just
now
touched
the
ship
as
if
they
had
grasped
her
as
if
she
resisted
stretching
her
arms
toward
heaven
and
hark
now
this
frightful
cry
this
scream
shuddering
and
silent
stand
the
people
upon
the
shore
staring
at
the
ships
and
the
cannon
are
silenced
the
flags
are
no
longer
waved
all
is
suddenly
still
once
more
it
seems
as
if
that
voice
was
heard
loudly
shrieking
the
one
name
alexis
trembling
and
quivering
alexis
orloff
orders
his
boat
to
return
to
the
shore
in
the
admiral
s
ship
all
is
now
still
the
princess
is
no
longer
on
the
deck
she
has
disappeared
the
people
on
shore
maintained
that
they
had
seen
her
loaded
with
chains
and
then
taken
away
where
all
was
still
the
boats
returned
to
the
shore
count
orloff
gave
his
hand
to
the
handsome
madame
dyke
to
assist
her
in
landing
madame
he
whispered
i
will
wait
upon
you
with
the
thanks
of
my
empress
you
have
rendered
us
an
essential
the
people
at
the
landing
received
them
with
howls
hisses
and
curses
but
count
orloff
with
a
contemptuous
smile
strewed
gold
among
them
and
their
clamors
ceased
tranquil
and
still
lay
the
russian
fleet
in
the
haven
but
the
ports
of
the
admiral
s
ship
were
opened
and
the
yawning
cannon
peeped
threateningly
forth
no
boats
were
allowed
to
approach
the
ship
but
some
impelled
by
curiosity
nevertheless
ventured
it
and
at
the
cabin
window
they
thought
they
saw
the
pale
princess
wringing
her
hands
her
arms
loaded
with
chains
others
also
asserted
that
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
they
had
heard
loud
lamentations
coming
from
the
admiral
s
ship
on
the
next
day
the
russian
fleet
weighed
anchor
for
petersburg
proudly
sailed
the
admiral
s
ship
in
advance
of
the
others
and
soon
became
invisible
in
the
horizon
on
the
shore
stood
count
alexis
orloff
and
as
he
saw
the
ships
sailing
past
with
a
savage
smile
he
muttered
it
is
accomplished
my
beautiful
empress
will
be
satisfied
with
me
conclusion
she
was
satisfied
the
great
the
sublime
empress
satisfied
with
the
work
alexis
orloff
had
accomplished
and
with
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
in
the
presence
of
her
confidential
friends
she
permitted
orloff
s
messenger
joseph
ribas
to
relate
to
her
all
the
particulars
of
the
affair
from
the
commencement
to
the
end
and
to
the
narrator
she
nodded
her
approval
with
a
fell
smile
yes
said
she
to
gregory
orloff
we
understand
women
s
hearts
and
therefore
sent
alexis
to
entrap
her
a
handsome
man
is
the
best
jailer
for
a
woman
from
whom
she
never
runs
and
bending
nearer
to
gregory
s
ear
she
whispered
i
myself
your
empress
am
almost
your
prisoner
you
wicked
handsome
man
and
ravished
by
the
beauty
of
gregory
orloff
the
third
in
the
ranks
of
her
recognized
favorites
the
empress
leaned
upon
his
arm
whispering
words
of
tenderness
in
his
ear
and
what
does
your
sublime
majesty
decide
upon
respecting
the
prisoner
humbly
asked
joseph
ribas
oh
i
had
almost
forgotten
her
said
the
empress
with
indifference
she
is
then
yet
living
this
daughter
of
elizabeth
she
is
yet
the
empress
for
some
time
thoughtfully
walked
back
and
forth
occasionally
turning
her
bold
eagle
eye
upon
her
two
favorite
pictures
hanging
upon
the
wall
they
were
full
of
terrible
truth
they
displayed
the
running
blood
the
trembling
flesh
the
rage
of
opponents
and
the
of
the
defeated
such
were
the
pictures
loved
by
catharine
and
the
sight
of
which
always
inspired
her
with
bold
thoughts
as
she
now
glanced
at
these
sanguinary
pictures
a
pleasant
smile
drew
over
the
face
of
this
northern
semiramis
she
had
just
come
to
a
decision
and
being
content
with
it
expressed
her
satisfaction
by
a
smile
that
bleeding
feminine
torso
said
she
pointing
to
one
of
the
pictures
look
at
it
gregory
that
wonderful
feminine
back
reminds
me
of
the
vengeance
elizabeth
took
for
the
beauty
of
eleonore
lapuschkin
well
elizabeth
s
pretended
daughter
shall
find
me
teachable
i
will
learn
from
her
mother
how
to
punish
let
this
criminal
be
conducted
to
the
same
place
where
the
fair
lapuschkin
suffered
and
as
she
was
served
so
serve
elizabeth
s
daughter
we
have
no
desire
to
tear
out
the
tongue
of
this
child
whip
her
that
is
all
but
whip
her
well
and
effectually
you
understand
me
and
while
she
said
this
that
animated
smile
deserted
not
catharine
s
lips
for
a
moment
and
her
features
constantly
displayed
the
utmost
cheerfulness
i
think
said
she
turning
to
gregory
that
is
bringing
an
expiatory
offering
to
the
fair
eleonore
lapuschkin
and
we
here
exercise
justice
in
the
name
of
god
as
to
you
she
then
said
to
joseph
ribas
we
have
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
you
and
you
shall
not
go
without
your
reward
moreover
our
beloved
alexis
orloff
has
especially
recommended
you
to
us
and
spoken
very
highly
of
your
information
and
talents
you
shall
be
joseph
ribas
was
rewarded
by
the
empress
with
the
place
of
an
officer
and
teacher
in
the
corps
of
cadets
afterward
upon
the
recommendation
of
betzkoi
he
was
made
the
tutor
of
bobrinsky
one
of
the
sons
of
the
empress
by
gregory
orloff
he
accompanied
bobrinsky
in
all
his
travels
says
massen
and
inoculated
the
prince
with
all
the
terrible
vices
he
himself
at
a
later
period
as
we
have
already
said
he
became
an
admiral
and
a
favorite
of
potemkin
the
fourth
of
catharine
s
lovers
it
was
a
dark
and
dreadfully
cold
night
petersburg
slept
the
streets
were
deserted
and
silent
but
there
upon
the
place
where
elizabeth
once
caused
the
beautiful
lapuschkin
to
be
tortured
there
torches
glanced
there
dark
forms
were
moving
to
and
fro
there
a
mysterious
life
was
stirring
what
was
being
done
there
no
spectators
are
assembled
around
these
barriers
catharine
had
commanded
all
petersburg
to
sleep
at
this
hour
and
accordingly
it
slept
nobody
is
upon
the
place
nobody
but
the
cold
unfeeling
executioners
and
their
assistants
nobody
but
that
pale
feeble
and
shrunken
woman
who
in
her
slight
white
dress
kneels
at
the
feet
of
her
executioners
she
yet
lives
it
is
true
but
her
soul
has
long
since
fled
her
heart
has
long
been
broken
the
chains
and
tortures
of
her
imprisonment
have
done
that
for
her
it
was
alexis
orloff
who
murdered
natalie
s
heart
and
soul
for
him
had
she
wept
until
her
tears
had
been
exhausted
for
him
had
she
lamented
until
her
voice
had
become
extinct
she
now
no
longer
weeps
no
longer
complains
glancing
at
her
executioners
she
smiles
and
raising
her
hands
to
god
she
thanks
him
that
at
last
she
is
about
to
die
she
is
yet
praying
when
her
executioners
approach
and
roughly
raise
her
up
when
they
tear
off
her
light
robe
and
devour
with
their
brutal
eyes
her
noble
naked
form
her
soul
is
with
god
to
whom
she
yet
prays
but
when
they
would
rend
from
her
bosom
the
chain
to
which
paulo
s
papers
are
attached
she
shudders
her
eyes
flash
and
she
holds
the
papers
in
her
convulsively
clinched
hands
i
have
sworn
to
defend
them
with
my
life
she
exclaims
aloud
paulo
paulo
i
will
keep
my
word
and
with
the
boldness
of
a
lioness
she
defends
herself
against
her
executioners
leave
her
those
papers
commanded
joseph
ribas
who
was
present
by
order
of
the
empress
she
may
keep
them
now
they
will
directly
be
ours
oh
paulo
i
have
kept
the
promise
i
made
thee
murmured
natalie
she
then
implores
to
be
allowed
to
read
them
and
joseph
ribas
grants
her
the
desired
permission
with
trembling
hands
she
breaks
the
seal
and
reads
by
the
light
of
a
torch
held
up
for
her
a
melancholy
smile
flits
over
her
features
and
her
arms
fall
powerless
ah
they
are
the
proofs
of
my
imperial
descent
nothing
further
how
little
is
that
paulo
and
now
lifting
her
up
they
raise
her
high
upon
the
backs
of
the
executioners
the
knout
whistles
as
it
whirls
through
the
air
the
noble
blood
flows
in
streams
she
makes
no
complaint
she
prays
only
once
overcome
by
pain
only
once
she
loudly
screams
mercy
for
the
daughter
of
an
empress
