this
story
was
originally
written
for
a
military
periodical
it
has
been
fortunate
enough
to
receive
much
commendation
from
military
men
and
for
them
it
is
now
specially
issued
in
its
present
form
for
the
general
public
it
may
be
as
well
to
add
that
where
translations
are
appended
to
the
french
phrases
those
translations
usually
follow
the
idiomatic
and
particular
meaning
attached
to
these

in

of

undeserved
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
that
was
circling
round

out
of

showed

brilliancy
as
a
woman
handsome
thoroughbred
languid
nonchalant
with
a
certain
latent
recklessness
under
the
impressive
calm
of

a
singular
softness
given

very
beautifully
shaped
on
the

with
a
certain
gentle
mournful
look
that
his

had
with
them
it
was
no
wonder
that
great

alike
gave
him
the

as

in

not

yet
ca
you
get
that
tawny
color
in
the
tiger
skin
there
you
go
so
much
to

shook
his
head
in
turn
as
he
set
down
the
incorrigible
tops
beside
six
pairs
of
their
fellows

six

six
of

but
the

walked
in

out
just
as
if
the

gave

gruel
and
chilled
water
after
the
shaking

the

between

rake
considered
that
he
knew
more
about
horses
than
any
other
man
living
and
the
other
functionary
proportionately
resented
back
his
knowledge
and
his
interference
as
utterly
out

of

to
catch

he
could
in
the
softest
and
sleepiest
of
tones
bertie
cecil
drank
a
glass
of
curacoa
put
his
tall
lithe
limbs
indolently
off
his
sofa
and
surrendered
himself
to
the
martyrdom
of
cuirass
and
gorget
standing
six
feet
one
without
his
spurred
jacks
but
and
full
of
grace
as
a
deer
or
his
weight
would
not
have
been
what
it
was
in
races
from
the
hunt
at
la
marche
to
the
grand
national
in
the
shires
as
if
parliament
could
meet
without
dragging
us
through
the
dust
the
idiots
write
about
swells
in
the
guards
as
if
we
had
all
fun
and
no
work
and
knew
nothing
of
the
rough
of
the
service
i
should
like
to
learn
what
they
call
sitting
motionless
in
your
saddle
through
half
a
day
while
a
london
mob
goes
mad
round
you
and
lost
dogs
snap
at
your
charger
nose
and
dirty
little
beggars
squeeze
against
your
legs
and
the
sun
broils
you
or
the
fog
soaks
you
and
you
sit
sentinel
over
a
gingerbread
coach
till
you
deaf
with
the
noise
and
blind
with
the
dust
and
sick
with
the
crowd
and
half
dead
for
want
of
sodas
and
brandies
and
from
going
a
whole
morning
without
one
cigarette
not
to
mention
the
inevitable
who
invariably
entangles
herself
between
your
horse
legs
and
the
certainty
of
your
riding
down
somebody
and
having
a
summons
about
it
the
next
day
if
all
that
the
rough
of
the
service
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
why
the
hottest
day
in
the
batteries
or
the
sharpest
rush
into
ghoorkhas
or
bhoteahs
would
be
light
work
compared
murmured
cecil
with
the
most
plaintive
pity
for
the
hardships
of
life
in
the
household
while
rake
with
the
rapid
proficiency
of
long
habit
braced
and
buckled
and
buttoned
knotted
the
sash
with
the
knack
of
professional
genius
girt
on
the
brightest
of
all
glittering
polished
silver
steel
with
its
rich
gild
mountings
and
contemplated
with
flattering
leathers
white
as
snow
jacks
brilliant
as
black
varnish
could
make
them
and
silver
spurs
of
glittering
radiance
until
his
master
stood
full
harnessed
at
length
as
gallant
a
life
guardsman
as
ever
did
duty
at
the
palace
by
making
love
to
the
handsomest
to
sit
wedged
in
with
one
troop
for
five
hours
and
in
a
drizzle
too
houses
ought
to
meet
until
the
day
fine
i
sure
they
are
in
no
hurry
said
cecil
to
himself
as
he
pocketed
a
dainty
filmy
handkerchief
all
perfume
point
and
embroidery
with
the
interlaced
and
the
crest
on
the
corner
while
he
looked
hopelessly
out
of
the
window
he
was
perfectly
happy
drenched
to
the
skin
on
the
moors
after
a
royal
or
in
a
fast
thing
with
the
melton
men
from
thorpe
trussels
to
ranksborough
but
three
drops
of
rain
when
on
duty
were
a
totally
different
matter
to
be
resented
with
any
amount
of
dandy
lamentations
and
epicurean
diatribes
ah
young
one
how
are
you
is
the
day
very
bad
he
asked
with
languid
wistfulness
as
the
door
opened
but
indifferent
and
weary
on
account
of
the
weather
as
the
tone
was
his
eyes
rested
with
a
kindly
cordial
light
on
the
newcomer
a
young
fellow
of
scarcely
twenty
like
himself
in
feature
though
much
smaller
and
slighter
in
build
a
graceful
boy
enough
with
no
fault
in
his
face
except
a
certain
weakness
in
the
mouth
just
shadowed
only
as
yet
with
down
a
celebrity
the
the
last
coryphee
whom
bertie
had
translated
from
a
sphere
of
garret
to
a
sphere
of
villa
champagne
and
chicken
and
who
of
course
in
proportion
to
the
previous
scarcity
of
her
grew
immediately
intolerant
of
any
wine
less
than
the
dozen
said
the
cecil
cared
for
nothing
longer
than
a
fortnight
unless
it
was
his
horse
forest
king
it
was
very
ungrateful
in
the
since
he
cared
for
her
at
the
least
a
whole
quarter
paying
for
his
fidelity
at
the
tune
of
a
hundred
a
month
and
also
it
was
not
true
for
besides
forest
king
he
loved
his
young
brother
berkeley
which
however
she
neither
knew
nor
guessed
beastly
replied
the
young
gentleman
in
reference
to
the
weather
which
was
indeed
pretty
tolerable
for
an
english
morning
in
february
i
say
bertie
are
you
in
a
hurry
the
very
deuce
of
a
hurry
little
one
why
bertie
never
was
in
a
hurry
however
and
he
said
this
as
lazily
as
possible
shaking
the
white
horsehair
over
his
helmet
and
drawing
in
deep
draughts
of
turkish
latakia
previous
to
parting
with
his
pipe
for
the
whole
of
four
or
five
hours
because
i
am
in
a
hole
no
end
of
a
hole
and
i
thought
you
help
me
murmured
the
boy
half
penitently
half
caressingly
he
was
very
girlish
in
his
face
and
his
ways
on
which
confession
rake
retired
into
the
bathroom
he
could
hear
just
as
well
there
and
a
sense
of
decorum
made
him
withdraw
though
his
presence
would
have
been
wholly
forgotten
by
them
in
something
the
same
spirit
as
the
french
countess
accounted
for
her
employing
her
valet
to
bring
her
her
chocolate
in
bed
est
ce
que
vous
appelez
cette
un
homme
bertie
had
on
occasion
so
wholly
regarded
servants
as
necessary
furniture
that
he
had
gone
through
a
love
scene
with
that
handsome
coquette
lady
regalia
totally
oblivious
of
the
presence
of
the
groom
of
the
chambers
and
the
possibility
of
that
person
appearance
in
the
of
the
divorce
court
it
was
in
no
way
his
passion
that
blinded
him
he
did
not
put
the
steam
on
like
that
and
never
went
in
for
any
disturbing
emotion
it
was
simply
habit
and
forgetfulness
that
those
functionaries
were
not
born
mute
deaf
and
sightless
he
tossed
some
essence
over
his
hands
and
drew
on
his
gauntlets
what
up
berk
the
boy
hung
his
head
and
played
a
little
uneasily
with
an
ormolu
upsetting
half
the
tobacco
in
it
he
was
trained
to
his
brother
nonchalant
impenetrable
school
and
used
to
his
set
a
cool
listless
reckless
thoroughbred
and
impassive
set
whose
first
canon
was
that
you
must
lose
your
last
thousand
in
the
world
without
giving
a
sign
that
you
winced
and
must
win
half
a
million
without
showing
that
you
were
gratified
but
he
had
something
of
girlish
weakness
in
his
nature
and
a
reserve
in
his
temperament
that
was
with
difficulty
conquered
bertie
looked
at
him
and
laid
his
hand
gently
on
the
young
shoulder
come
my
boy
out
with
it
it
nothing
very
bad
i
be
bound
i
want
some
more
money
a
couple
of
ponies
said
the
boy
a
little
huskily
he
did
not
meet
his
brother
eyes
that
were
looking
straight
down
on
him
cecil
gave
a
long
low
whistle
and
drew
a
meditative
whiff
from
his
meerschaum
tres
cher
you
always
wanting
money
so
am
i
so
is
everybody
the
normal
state
of
man
is
to
want
money
two
ponies
what
it
for
i
lost
it
at
last
night
poulteney
lent
it
me
and
i
told
him
i
would
send
it
him
in
the
morning
the
ponies
were
gone
before
i
thought
of
it
bertie
and
i
have
a
notion
where
to
get
them
to
pay
him
heavy
stakes
young
one
for
you
murmured
cecil
while
his
hand
dropped
from
the
boy
shoulder
and
a
shadow
of
gravity
passed
over
his
face
money
was
very
scarce
with
himself
berkeley
gave
him
a
hurried
appealing
glance
he
was
used
to
shift
all
his
anxieties
on
to
his
elder
brother
and
to
be
helped
by
him
under
any
difficulty
cecil
never
allotted
two
seconds
thought
to
his
own
embarrassments
but
he
would
multiply
them
tenfold
by
taking
other
people
on
him
as
well
with
an
unremitting
and
thoughtless
good
nature
i
could
help
it
pleaded
the
lad
with
coaxing
and
almost
piteous
apology
i
backed
grosvenor
play
and
you
know
he
always
the
most
wonderful
luck
in
the
world
i
could
tell
he
go
a
crowner
and
have
such
cards
as
he
had
how
shall
i
get
the
money
bertie
i
ask
the
governor
and
besides
i
told
poulteney
he
should
have
it
this
morning
what
do
you
think
if
i
sold
the
mare
but
then
i
could
sell
her
in
a
minute
cecil
laughed
a
little
but
his
eyes
as
they
rested
on
the
lad
young
fair
womanish
face
were
very
gentle
under
the
long
shade
of
their
lashes
sell
the
mare
nonsense
how
should
anybody
live
without
a
hack
i
can
pull
you
through
i
dare
say
ah
by
george
there
the
quarters
chiming
i
shall
be
too
late
as
i
not
hurried
still
however
even
by
that
near
prospect
he
sauntered
to
his
took
up
one
of
the
pretty
velvet
and
absurdities
and
shook
out
all
the
banknotes
there
were
in
it
there
were
fives
and
tens
enough
to
count
up
pounds
he
reached
over
and
caught
up
a
five
from
a
little
heap
lying
loose
on
a
novel
of
du
terrail
and
tossed
the
whole
across
the
room
to
the
boy
there
you
are
young
one
but
do
borrow
of
any
but
your
own
people
again
berk
we
do
do
that
no
no
no
thanks
shut
up
all
that
if
ever
you
get
in
a
hole
i
take
you
out
if
i
can
will
you
go
to
the
lords
better
not
nothing
to
see
and
still
less
to
hear
all
stale
that
the
only
comfort
for
us
we
are
outside
he
said
with
something
that
almost
approached
hurry
in
the
utterance
so
great
was
his
terror
of
anything
approaching
a
scene
and
so
eager
was
he
to
escape
his
brother
gratitude
the
boy
had
taken
the
notes
with
delighted
thanks
indeed
but
with
that
tranquil
and
unprotesting
readiness
with
which
spoiled
childishness
or
unhesitating
selfishness
accepts
gifts
and
sacrifices
from
another
generosity
which
have
been
so
general
that
they
have
ceased
to
have
magnitude
as
his
brother
passed
him
however
he
caught
his
hand
a
second
and
looked
up
with
a
mist
before
his
eyes
and
a
flush
half
of
shame
half
of
gratitude
on
his
face
what
a
trump
you
are
how
good
you
are
bertie
cecil
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
first
time
i
ever
heard
it
my
dear
boy
he
answered
as
he
lounged
down
the
staircase
his
chains
clashing
and
jingling
while
pressing
his
helmet
on
to
his
forehead
and
pulling
the
chin
scale
over
his
mustaches
he
sauntered
out
into
the
street
where
his
charger
was
waiting
the
deuce
he
thought
as
he
settled
himself
in
his
stirrups
while
the
raw
morning
wind
tossed
his
white
plume
hither
and
thither
i
never
remembered
i
do
believe
i
left
myself
money
enough
to
take
willon
and
rake
and
the
cattle
down
to
the
shires
if
i
should
have
kept
enough
to
take
my
own
ticket
with
that
would
be
no
end
of
a
sell
on
my
word
i
do
know
how
much
there
left
on
the
well
i

to
be
paid

that
looks
the
pounds
had
been
the
last
remnant
of
a
bill
done
under
great
difficulties
with
a
sagacious
jew
and
cecil
had
no
more
certainty
of
possessing
any
more
money
until
next
should
come
round
than
he
had
of
possessing
the
moon
lack
of
ready
money
moreover
is
a
serious
inconvenience
when
you
belong
to
clubs
where
pounds
and
fives
are
the
lowest
points
and
live
with
men
who
take
the
odds
on
most
events
in
thousands
but
the
thing
was
done
he
would
not
have
undone
it
at
the
boy
loss
if
he
could
and
cecil
who
never
was
worried
by
the
loss
of
the
most
stupendous
crusher
and
who
made
it
a
rule
never
to
think
of
disagreeable
inevitabilities
two
minutes
together
shook
his
bridle
and
cantered
down
piccadilly
toward
the
barracks
while
black
douglas
reared
curveted
made
as
if
he
would
kick
and
finally
ended
by
passaging
down
half
the
length
of
the
road
to
the
imminent
peril
of
all
and
looking
eminently
glossy

and
while
he
thus
expressed
his
disapprobation
of
forming

home
secretary
should
see
about
it

on

continuously
with
and

hour
before

i
get
some

to
speak
about

for
the

of
the
unwashed
and
prevention
of
their
suffocating

brigades
murmured
cecil
to
the
earl
of
broceliande
next
him
as
they
sat
down
in
their
saddles
with
the
rest
of
the
first
life
in
front
of
stephen
with
a
hazy
fog
steaming
round
them
and
a
london
mob
crushing
against
their
chargers
flanks
while
black
douglas
stood
like
a
rock
though
a
butcher
tray
was
pressed
against
his
withers
a
mongrel
was
snapping
at
his
hocks
and
the
inevitable
of
cecil
prophetic
horror
was
wildly
plunging
between
his
legs
as
the
rushed
down
in
insane
headlong
haste
to
stare
at
and
crush
on
to
that
superb
body
of
guards
i
would
give
a
kingdom
for
a
soda
and
brandy
bah
ye
gods
what
a
smell
of
fish
and
fustian
signed
bertie
with
a
yawn
of
utter
famine
for
want
of
something
to
drink
and
something
to
smoke
were
it
only
a
glass
of
brown
sherry
and
a
little
papelito
while
he
glanced
down
at
the
and
masterpieces
of
rake
genius
all
smirched
and
splashed
and
smeared
he
had
given
fifty
pounds
away
and
scarcely
knew
whether
he
should
have
enough
to
take
his
ticket
next
day
into
the
shires
and
he
owed
fifty
hundred
without
having
the
slightest
grounds
for
supposing
he
should
ever
be
able
to
pay
it
and
he
cared
no
more
about
either
of
these
things
than
he
cared
about
the
throwing
the
peaches
into
the
river
after
a
richmond
dinner
in
the
effort
to
hit
with
them
but
to
be
half
a
day
without
a
cigarette
and
to
have
a
disagreeable
odor
of
apples
and
corduroys
wafted
up
to
him
was
a
calamity
that
made
him
insupportably
depressed
and
unhappy
well
why
not
it
is
the
trifles
of
life
that
are
its
bores
after
all
most
men
can
meet
ruin
calmly
for
instance
or
laugh
when
they
lie
in
a
ditch
with
their
own
and
their
hunter
spine
broken
over
the
double
post
and
rails
it
is
the
mud
that
has
choked
up
your
horn
just
when
you
wanted
to
rally
the
pack
it
the
whip
who
carries
you
off
to
a
division
just
when
you
sat
down
to
your
turbot
it
the
ten
seconds
by
which
you
miss
the
train
it
the
dust
that
gets
in
your
eyes
as
you
go
down
to
epsom
it
the
pretty
little
rose
note
that
went
by
accident
to
your
house
instead
of
your
club
and
raised
a
storm
from
madame
it
the
dog
that
always
will
run
wild
into
the
birds
it
the
cook
who
always
will
season
the
white
soup

it
is
these
that
are
the
bores
of
life
and
that
try
the
temper
of
your
philosophy
an
acquaintance
of
mine
told
me
the
other
day
of
having
lost
heavy
sums
through
a
swindler
with
as
placid
an
indifference
as
if
he
had
lost
a
toothpick
but
he
swore
like
a
trooper
because
a
thief
had
stolen
the
hoof
of
a
dead
pet
hunter
insufferable
murmured
cecil
hiding
another
yawn
behind
his
gauntlet
the
line
nothing
half
so
bad
as
this
one
day
in
a
london
mob
beats
a
year
campaigning
what
charging
a
pah
to
charging
an
or
a
parapet
of
fascines
to
a
bristling
row
of
umbrellas
which
question
as
to
the
relative
hardships
of
the
two
arms
was
a
question
of
military
interest
never
answered
as
cecil
scattered
the
umbrellas
right
and
left
and
dashed
from
the
houses
of
parliament
full
trot
with
the
rest
of
the
escort
on
the
return
to
the
palace
the
afternoon
sun
breaking
out
with
a
brightened
gleam
from
the
clouds
and
flashing
off
the
drawn
swords
the
streaming
plumes
the
glittering
breastplates
the
gold
embroideries
and
the
fretting
chargers
but
a
mere
just
when
the
thing
was
over
and
the
escort
was
pacing
back
to
hyde
park
barracks
could
not
console
cecil
for
fog
wind
mud
bad
odors
and
the
uproar
and
of
the
streets
specially
when
his
throat
was
as
dry
as
a
and
his
longing
for
the
sight
of
a
cheroot
approaching
desperation
unlimited
sodas
three
pipes
smoked
silently
over
delphine
last
novel
a
bath
well
dashed
with
eau
de
cologne
and
some
glasses
of
anisette
after
the
of
unharnessing
restored
him
a
little
but
he
was
still
weary
and
depressed
into
gentler
languor
than
ever
through
all
the
courses
at
a
dinner
party
at
the
austrian
embassy
and
did
not
recover
his
dejection
at
a
reception
of
the
duchess
of
where
the
prettiest
french
countess
of
her
time
asked
him
if
anything
was
the
matter
yes
said
bertie
with
a
sigh
and
a
profound
melancholy
in
what
the
woman
called
his
handsome
spanish
eyes
i
have
had
a
great
misfortune
we
have
been
on
duty
all
day
he
did
not
thoroughly
recover
tone
light
and
careless
though
his
temper
was
till
the
in
her
of
a
villa
prescribed
crème
de
bouzy
and
parfait
amour
in
succession
with
a
considerable
amount
of
ice
at
three
in
the
morning
which
restorative
prescription
succeeded
indeed
it
took
something
as
tremendous
as
divorce
from
all
forms
of
smoking
for
five
hours
to
make
an
impression
on
bertie
he
had
the
most
serene
insouciance
that
ever
a
man
was
blessed
with
in
worry
he
did
not
believe
he
never
let
it
come
near
him
and
beyond
a
little
difficulty
sometimes
in
separating
too
many
entangled
caught
round
him
at
the
same
time
and
the
annoyance
of
a
miscalculation
on
the
flat
or
the
when
a
maldon
or
danebury
favorite
came
nowhere
or
his
book
was
wrong
for
the
grand
national
cecil
had
no
cares
of
any
sort
or
description
true
the
royallieu
peerage
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
almost
one
of
the
most
impoverished
in
the
kingdom
could
ill
afford
to
maintain
its
sons
in
the
expensive
career
on
which
it
had
launched
them
and
the
chief
there
was
to
spare
usually
went
between
the
eldest
son
a
secretary
of
legation
in
that
costly
and
charming
city
of
vienna
and
the
young
one
berkeley
through
the
old
viscount
partiality
so
that
had
bertie
ever
gone
so
far
as
to
study
his
actual
position
he
would
have
probably
confessed
that
it
was
to
say
the
least
awkward
but
then
he
never
did
this
certainly
never
did
it
thoroughly
sometimes
he
felt
himself
near
the
wind
when
came
or
the
jews
appeared
utterly
impracticable
but
as
a
rule
things
had
always
trimmed
somehow
and
though
his
debts
were
considerable
and
he
was
literally
as
penniless
as
a
man
can
be
to
stay
in
the
guards
at
all
he
had
never
in
any
shape
realized
the
want
of
money
he
might
not
be
able
to
raise
a
guinea
to
go
toward
that
account
his
army
tailor
bill
and
post
obits
had
long
ago
forestalled
the
few
hundred
a
year
that
under
his
mother
settlements
would
come
to
him
at
the
death
but
cecil
had
never
known
in
his
life
what
it
was
not
to
have
a
stud
not
to
live
as
luxuriously
as
a
duke
not
to
order
the
costliest
dinners
at
the
clubs
and
be
among
the
first
to
lead
all
the
splendid
entertainments
and
extravagances
of
the
household
he
had
never
been
without
his
highland
shooting
his
baden
gaming
his
schooner
among
the
squadron
his
september
battues
his
pytchley
hunting
his
pretty
expensive
and
other
toys
his
drag
for
epsom
and
his
trap
and
hack
for
the
park
his
crowd
of
engagements
through
the
season
and
his
bevy
of
fair
leaders
of
the
fashion
to
smile
on
him
and
shower
their
on
him
like
a
rain
of
as
one
of
the
best
best
that
is
in
the
sense
of
fashion
flirting
waltzing
and
general
social
distinction
in
no
other
sense
for
the
newest
of
debutantes
knew
well
that
beauty
though
the
most
perfect
of
flirts
would
never
be
serious
and
had
nothing
to
be
serious
with
on
which
understanding
he
was
allowed
by
the
sex
to
have
the
run
of
their
boudoirs
and
much
as
if
he
were
a
little
they
counted
him
quite
he
made
love
to
the
married
women
to
be
sure
but
he
was
quite
certain
not
to
run
away
with
the
marriageable
daughters
hence
bertie
had
never
felt
the
want
of
all
that
is
bought
by
and
represents
money
and
imbibed
a
vague
indistinct
impression
that
all
these
things
that
made
life
pleasant
came
by
nature
and
were
the
natural
inheritance
and
concomitants
of
anybody
born
in
a
decent
station
and
endowed
with
a
tolerable
tact
such
a
difficulty
as
not
having
gold
enough
to
pay
for
his
own
and
his
transit
to
the
shires
had
very
rarely
stared
him
in
the
face
and
when
it
did
he
trusted
to
chance
to
lift
him
safely
over
such
a
social
yawner
and
rarely
trusted
in
vain
according
to
all
the
canons
of
his
order
he
was
never
excited
never
disappointed
never
exhilarated
never
disturbed
and
also
of
course
never
by
any
chance
embarrassed
votre
imperturbabilite
as
the
prince
de
ligne
used
to
designate
la
grande
catherine
would
have
been
an
admirable
designation
for
cecil
he
was
imperturbable
under
everything
even
when
an
heiress
with
feet
as
colossal
as
her
fortune
made
him
a
proposal
of
marriage
and
he
had
to
retreat
from
all
the
offered
honors
and
threatened
horrors
he
courteously
but
steadily
declined
them
nor
in
more
interesting
adventures
was
he
less
happy
in
his
coolness
when
my
lord
regalia
who
never
knew
when
he
was
not
wanted
came
in
inopportunely
in
a
very
tender
scene
of
the
young
guardsman
then
but
a
cornet
with
his
handsome
countess
cecil
lifted
his
long
lashes
lazily
turning
to
him
a
face
of
the
most
and
innocent
demureness
or
consummate
impudence
whichever
you
like

solitaire
interesting
game

fix
though
the
ball
in
left
all
alone
in
the
middle
do
you
think
lord
regalia
felt
his
own
similarity
to
the
ball
in
a
fix
too
keenly
to
appreciate
the
interesting
character
of
the
amusement
or
the
coolness
of
the
chief
performer
in
it
but
beauty
solitaire
became
a
synonym
thenceforth
among
the
household
to
typify
any
very
tender
passages
sotto
this
made
his
reputation
on
the
town
the
ladies
called
it
very
wicked
but
were
charmed
by
the
impudence
all
the
same
and
petted
the
sinner
and
from
then
till
now
he
had
held
his
own
with
them
dashing
through
life
very
fast
as
became
the
first
riding
man
in
the
brigades
but
enjoying
it
very
fully
smoothly
and
softly
liking
the
world
and
being
liked
by
it
to
be
sure
in
the
background
there
was
always
that
ogre
of
money
and
the
beast
had
a
knack
of
growing
bigger
and
darker
every
year
but
then
on
the
other
hand
cecil
never
looked
at
him
never
thought
about
him
knew
too
that
he
stood
just
as
much
behind
the
chairs
of
men
whom
the
world
accredited
as
millionaires
and
whenever
the
ogre
gave
him
a
cold
grip
that
there
was
for
the

no
escaping
washed
away

touch
of
it

on
in

doubtless
of
days

ringing
notes

over

dozing
and
dreaming
pleasantly

alert
for
all
that
for

suddenly
shook
himself

a
hilarious
roll
in

stood
at
awake
only
could
you
tell
the
generous
and
gallant
promise
of
his
perfect
temper

there
are
no
eyes
that
speak
more
truly
none
on
earth
that
are
so
beautiful
as
the
eyes
of
a
horse
forest
king
were
dark
as
a
gazelle
soft
as
a
woman
brilliant
as
stars
a
little
dreamy
and
mournful
and
as
infinitely
caressing
when
he
looked
at
what
he
loved
as
they
could
blaze
full
of
light
and
fire
when
danger
was
near
and
rivalry
against
him
how
loyally
such
eyes
have
looked
at
me
over
the
paddock
fence
as
a
wild
happy
gallop
was
suddenly
broken
for
a
gentle
head
to
be
softly
pushed
against
my
hand
with
the
gentlest
of
welcomes
they
sadly
put
to
shame
the
million
human
eyes
that
so
fast
learn
the
lie
of
the
world
and
utter
it
as
falsely
as
the
lips
the
stood
alert
every
fiber
of
his
body
strung
to
pleasurable
excitation
the
door
opened

devoured
the

with

his

into

loosened
one
of

bandages
passed
his

from

to

glanced
round

sure

been

a

on

side
of

standing
a
little
in
advance
of
a

took
a

of

out
of

smiled

sir
i
should
be
glad
to
know

when

you

cecil
laughed
a

languidly

we
take
a

there

his
palm
over

withers

there
are
some
crushers
in
the
lot
you
have
to
do

forest
king
caught
the
manger
with
his
teeth
and
kicked
in
a
bit
of
play
and
ate
some
more
sugar
with
much
licking
of
his
lips
to
express
the
nonchalance
with
which
he
viewed
his
share
in
the
contest
and
his
tranquil
certainty
of
being
first
past
the
flags
his
master
looked
at
him
once
more
and
sauntered
out
of
the
box
he
in
form
rake
and
right
as
a
course
he
is
sir
nobody
ever
laid
leg
over
such
cattle
as
all
that
white
cockade
blood
and
he
the
very
best
of
the
strain
said
rake
as
he
held
up
his
lantern
across
the
that
looked
doubly
dark
in
the
february
night
after
the
bright
gas
glare
of
the
box
so
he
need
be
thought
cecil
as
a
bull
terrier
three
or
four
gordon
setters
an
alpine
mastiff
and
two
wiry
skyes
dashed
at
their
chains
giving
tongue
in
frantic
delight
at
the
sound
of
his
step
while
the
hounds
echoed
the
welcome
from
their
more
distant
kennels
and
he
went
slowly
across
the
great
stone
yard
with
the
end
of
a
huge
cheroot
glimmering
through
the
gloom
so
he
need
be
to
pull
me
through
the
ducal
and
the
october
let
me
in
for
it
enough
i
never
was
closer
in
my
life
the
deuce
if
i
do
do
the
distance
i
sha
have
sovereigns
enough
to
play
at
night
i
do
know
what
a
man
to
do
if
he
put
into
this
life
he
must
go
the
pace
of
it
why
did
royal
send
me
into
the
guards
if
he
meant
to
keep
the
screw
on
in
this
way
he
better
have
drafted
me
into
a
marching
regiment
at
once
if
he
wanted
me
to
live
upon
nothing
meant
anything
under
pounds
a
year
with
cecil
as
the
minimum
of
monetary
necessities
in
this
world
and
a
look
of
genuine
annoyance
and
trouble
most
unusual
there
was
on
his
face
the
picture
of
carelessness
and
gentle
indifference
habitually
though
shadowed
now
as
he
crossed
the
courtyard
after
his
visit
to
his
he
had
backed
forest
king
heavily
and
stood
to
win
or
lose
a
cracker
on
his
own
riding
on
the
morrow
and
though
he
had
found
sufficient
to
bring
him
into
the
shires
he
had
barely
enough
lying
on
his
up
in
the
bachelor
suite
within
to
pay
his
book
or
a
notion
where
to
get
more
if
the
king
should
find
his
match
over
the
ridge
and
furrow
in
the
morning
it
was
not
pleasant
a
cynical
savage
timon
derives
on
the
whole
a
good
amount
of
satisfaction
from
his
in
the
fine
philippics
against
his
contemporaries
that
it
is
certain
to
afford
and
the
magnificent
grievances
with
which
it
furnishes
him
but
when
life
is
very
pleasant
to
a
man
and
the
world
very
fond
of
him
when
existence
is
perfectly
smooth

single
pressure
of

for

may

is
abominably
bitter
and
requires

to

than

ever

it

a
bore
an

bore
a

martyrdom
that

that

not

forest

never
failed
me
yet
he
is
as
full
of
running
as
a
derby
winner
and
he
go
over
the
yawners
like
a
bird
thought
cecil
who
never
confronted
his
troubles
with
more
than
sixty
seconds
thought
and
who
was
of
that
light
impassible
of
temperament
that
both
throws
off
worry
easily
and
shirks
it
persistently
sufficient
for
the
day
was
the
essence
of
his
creed
and
if
he
had
enough
to
lay
a
fiver
at
night
on
the
rubber
he
was
quite
able
to
forget
for
the
time
that
he
wanted
five
hundred
for
in
the
morning
and
had
not
an
idea
how
to
get
it
there
was
not
a
trace
of
anxiety
on
him
when
he
opened
a
low
arched
door
passed
down
a
corridor
and
entered
the
warm
full
light
of
that
chamber
of
liberty
that
sanctuary
of
the
persecuted
that
temple
of
refuge
thrice
blessed
in
all
its
forms
throughout
the
land
that
consecrated
mecca
of
every
true
believer
in
the
divinity
of
the
meerschaum
and
the
paradise
of
the
nargile
the
a
spacious
easy
chamber
too
lined
with
the
laziest
of
divans
seen
just
now
through
a
fog
of
smoke
and
tenanted
by
nearly
a
score
of
men
in
every
imaginable
loose
velvet
costume
and
with
faces
as
well
known
in
the
park
at
six
in
may
and
on
the
heath
in
october
in
paris
in
january
and
on
the
solent
in
august
in
pratt
of
a
summer
night
and
on
the
moors
in
an
autumn
morning
as
though
they
were
features
that
came
round
as
regularly
as
the
july
or
the
waterloo
cup
some
were
puffing
away
in
calm
meditative
comfort
in
silence
that
they
would
not
have
broken
for
any
earthly
consideration
others
were
talking
hard
and
fast
and
through
the
air
heavily
weighted
with
the
varieties
of
tobacco
from
tiny
cigarettes
to
giant
cheroots
from
rough
bowls
full
of
cavendish
to
sybaritic
hookahs
a
babel
of
sentences
rose
together
gave
him
too
much
riding

take

bar
nothing
so
good
for
the

as

were
rushing
in
among

tossed
across
the
eddies
of

in
the
conflicting
tongues
loosened
in

made

slightly
inarticulate

full

of
a
story
of
whist
played
under
difficulties
in

doncaster
express
i
wanted

i
wanted

awfully

bertie
as

threw

down

laughed
the
seraph
known
to
the
rest
of
the
world
as
the
marquis
of

son
of
the
duke
of
lyonnesse
i
wished
monkeys
but
the
others
wished
ponies
and
hundreds
so
i
gave
in
vandebur
and
i
won
two
rubbers
and
we
just
begun
the
third
when
the
train
stopped
with
a
crash
none
of
us
dropped
the
cards
though
but
the
tricks
and
the
scores
all
went
down
with
the
shaking
play
in
that
row
said
charlie
for
the
women
were
shrieking
like
mad
and
the
engine
was
roaring
like
my
mare
philippa
i
afraid
she
never
be
cured
poor
thing
so
i
put
my
head
out
and
asked
what
was
up
we
run
into
a
cattle
train
anybody
hurt
no
nobody
hurt
but
we
were
to
get
out
be
shot
if

out
i
told

must
get
out
said
the

said
van
he
drank

waters
soon
threw
up
the
sponge
we
were
all
dying
with
laughter
and
i
tossed
him
a
tenner
my
good
fellow
said
i
the
carriage
and
let
us
finish
the
game
if
another
train
comes
up
give
it
lord
rockingham
compliments
and
say
he
thank
it
to

his
trumps
together
man
thought
us
mad
took
tenner
though
shunted
us
to
one
side
out
of
the
noise
and
we
played
two
rubbers
more
before
they
repaired
the
damage
and
sent
us
on
to
and
the
seraph
took
a
whiff
from
his
silver
meerschaum
and
then
a

of

out

despite
the
angelic
character
of
his

that
looked

as
innocent
as
those
of

too
much
of

up

he
carries
the
honor
of

are
some

there
no
denying
that
said
chesterfield
of
the
blues
who
was
called
tom
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
was
entirely
unlike
his
real
name
of
adolphus
where
he
was
curled
up
almost
invisible
except
for
the
movement
of
the
jasmine
stick
of
his
chibouque
that
brute
day
star

a
splendid

for
a

it

he
never

cecil
with
the
coils
of
his
hookah
bubbling
among
the
the
man
i
afraid
of
is
that
fellow
from
the
tenth
he
as
light
as
a
feather
and
as
hard
as
steel
i
watched
him
yesterday
going
over
the
water
and
the
horse
he
ride
for
trelawney
is
good
enough
to
beat
even
the
king
if
he
properly
you
have
kept
yourself
in
condition
beauty
growled
tom
with
the
chibouque
in
his
mouth
else
nothing
could
give
you
the
tempting
providence
to
go
in
for
the
gilt
vase
after
such
a
december
and
january
as
you
spent
in
paris
even
the
week
you
been
in
the
shires
you
have
trained
a
bit
you
been
waltzing
or
playing
baccarat
till
five
in
the
morning
and
taking
no
end
of
sodas
after
to
bring
you
right
for
the
meet
at
nine
if
a
man
will
drink
champagnes
and
burgundies
as
you
do
and
spend
his
time
after
women
i
should
like
to
know
how
to
be
in
hard
riding
condition
unless
he
expects
a
with
which
chesterfield

weighed
fourteen
stone
himself
and
was
therefore
out
of
all
but
and
wanted
a
of
tremendous
power
even
for
them
subsided
under
a
heap
of
velvet
and
cashmere
and
cecil
laughed
lying
on
a
divan
just
under
one
of
the
gas
branches
the
light
fell
full
on
his
handsome
face
with
its
fair
hue
and
its
gentle
languor
on
which
there
was
not
a
single
trace
of
the
outrecuidance
attributed
to
him
both
he
and
the
seraph
could
lead
the
wildest
life
of
any
men
in
europe
without
looking
one
shadow
more
worn
than
the
brightest
beauty
of
the
season
and
could
hold
wassail
in
riotous
rivalry
till
the
sun
rose
and
then
throw
themselves
into

as
fresh
as
if
they
had
been
sound
asleep
all
night
to
keep
up
with
the
pack
the
whole
day
in
a
fast
burst

on
a
cold
scent
or
in
whatever
sport

never

the
seraph
now
pulling
the
long
blond
mustaches
that
were
not
altogether
in

with
his
seraphic
cognomen
if
a
man
can

let
him
if

to
the
pigskin
he
be
in

enough
whether
he

all
as
if
you

changing
yourself
into

of
bones
it
utter
bosh
you
might
as
well
be

it
no

awful

plenty
himself
though
coxswain
said
i
must
begin
to
train
do
as
all
his
crew
did
i
threw
up
my
sleeve
and
showed
him
my
arm
and
the
seraph
stretched
out
an
arm
magnificent
enough
for
a
statue
of

said

should
have
seen
his
face
fatten
the
eight
he
did
let
me
do
that
of
course
but
he
was
very
glad
of
my
oar
in
his
rowlocks
and
i
helped
him
beat
cambridge
without
training
an
hour
myself
except
so
far
as
rowing
hard
and
the
marquis
of
rockingham
made
thirsty
by
the

dipped
his
fair
mustaches
into
a
foaming
seltzer
quite
right
seraph
said
cecil
when
a
man
comes
up
to
the
weights
looking
like
a
homunculus
after
he
been
getting
every
atom
of
flesh
off
him
like
a
jockey
he
ought
to
be
struck
out
for
the
stakes
to
my
mind
is
a
question
of
riding
then
nor
yet
of
pluck
or
of
management
it
nothing
but
a
question
of
pounds
and
of
who
can
stand
the
tamest
life

well
beneficial

been
in

for
years
troop
been
such
a
while
at
calcutta
the
fancy
take
to
him
rather
offering
very
freely
on
him
this
morning
in
the
village
and
he
got
a
rare
good
thing
in
the
not
a
doubt
of
it
the
white
lily

out
of
that
irish
mare

never

the
household
will
win
safe
enough
unless
forest
king
goes
and
breaks
his
back
over
brixworth
eh
beauty
said
the
seraph
who
believed
devoutly
in
his
comrade
with
all
the
loving
loyalty
characteristic
of
the
house
of
lyonnesse
that
to
monarchs
and
to
friends
had
often
cost
it
very
dear
you
put
your
faith
in
the
wrong
quarter
rock
i
may
fail
you
he
never
will
said
cecil
with
ever
so
slight
a
dash
of
sadness
in
his
words
the
thought
crossed
him
of
how
boldly
how
straightly
how
gallantly
the
horse
always
breasted
and
conquered
his
difficulties
did
he
himself
deal
half
so
well
with
his
own
well
you
both
of
you
carry
all
our
money
and
all
our
credit
so
for
the
fair
fame
of
the
household
do
you
know
i
have
hedged
a
shilling
not
laid
off
a
farthing
bertie
i
stand
on
you
and
the
king
and
nothing
else
see
what
a
sublime
faith
i
have
in
i
do
think
you
wise
then
seraph
the
field
will
be
very
strong
said
cecil
languidly
the
answer
was
indifferent
and
certainly
thankless
but
under
his
drooped
lids
a
glance
frank
and
warm
rested
for
the
moment
on
the
seraph
leonine
strength
and
raphaelesque
head
it
was
not
his
way
to
say
it
or
to
show
it
or
even
much
to
think
it
but
in
his
heart
he
loved
his
old
friend
wonderfully
well
and
they
talked
on
of
little
else
than
of
the
great
of
the
service
for
the
next
hour
in
the
while
the
great
clouds
of
scented
smoke
circled
heavily
round
making
a
halo
of
turkish
above
the
gold
locks
of
the
titanic
seraph
steeping
velvets
in
strong
odors
of
cavendish
and
drifting
a
light
mist
over
bertie
long
lithe
limbs
light
enough
and
skilled
enough
to
disdain
all
training
for
the
that
not
the
way
to
be
in
condition
growled
tom
getting
up
with
a
great
shake
as
the
clock
clanged
the
strokes
of
five
they
had
only
returned
from
a
ball
three
miles
off
when
cecil
had
paid
his
visit
to
the
loose
box
bertie
laughed
his
laugh
was
like
himself
rather
languid
but
very
very
silvery
very
engaging
sit
and
smoke
till
breakfast
time
if
you
like
tom
it
wo
make
any
difference
to
but
the
smoke
parliament
would
hear
of
the
champion
of
the
household
over
the
ridge
and
furrow
risking
the
steadiness
of
his
wrist
and
the
keenness
of
his
eye
by
any
such
additional
tempting
of
providence
and
went
off
itself
in
various
directions
with
iced
drinks
yawning
considerably
like
most
other
parliaments
after
a
sitting
it
was
the
old
family
place
of
the
royallieu
house
in
which
he
had
congregated
half
the
guardsmen
in
the
service
for
the
great
event
and
consequently
the
bachelor
chambers
in
it
were
of
the
utmost
comfort
and
spaciousness
and
when
cecil
sauntered
into
his
old
quarters
familiar
from
boyhood
he
could
not
have
been
better
off
in
his
own
luxurious
haunts
in
piccadilly
moreover
the
first
thing
that
caught
his
eye
was
a
dainty
scarlet
silk
riding
jacket
broidered
in
gold
and
silver
with
the
motto
of
his
house
coeur
vaillant
se
fait
royaume
all
circled
with
oak
and
laurel
leaves
on
the
collar
it
was
the
work
of
very
fair
hands
of
very
aristocratic
hands
and
he
looked
at
it
with
a
smile
ah
my
lady
my
lady
he
thought
half
aloud
do
you
really
love
me
do
i
really
love
you
there
was
a
laugh
in
his
eyes
as
he
asked
himself
what
might
be
termed
an
interesting
question
then
something
more
earnest
came
over
his
face
and
he
stood
a
second
with
the
pretty
costly
embroideries
in
his
hand
with
a
smile
that
was
almost
tender
though
it
was
still
much
more
amused
i
suppose
we
do
he
concluded
at
last
at
least
quite
as
much
as
is
ever
worth
while
passions
do
do
for
the
as
somebody
says
in
besides
i
would
not
feel
a
strong
emotion
for
the
universe
bad
style
always
and
more
detrimental
to
as
tom
would
say
than
three
bottles
of
brandy
he
was
so
little
near
what
he
dreaded
at
present
at
least
that
the
scarlet
jacket
was
tossed
down
again
and
gave
him
no
dreams
of
his
fair
and
titled
embroideress
he
looked
out
the
last
thing
at
some
ominous
clouds
drifting
heavily
up
before
the
dawn
and
the
state
of
the
weather
and
the
chance
of
its
being
rainy
filled
his
thoughts
to
the
utter
exclusion
of
the
donor
of
that
bright
dainty
gift
i
hope
to
goodness
there
wo
be
any
drenching
shower
forest
king
can
stand
ground
as
hard
as
a
slate
but
if
there
one
thing
he
weak
in
it
slush
was
bertie
last
conscious
thought
as
he
stretched
his
limbs
out
and
fell
sound
asleep

from

the

were
there
with

and
their

entry
of
thousands
and
the
din
and
the
turmoil
at

were
more

than
the

throngs
that
usually
mark

even
when

there
were
keen

and
heavy
stakes
on

the

had
never
stood
still
a

in

or
the

and
even
the
knowing
ones
the
worshipers
of
the
flat
alone
the
professionals
who
ran
down
gentlemen
races
and
the
hypercritics
who
affirmed
that
there
is
not
such
a
thing
as
a
to
be
found
on

since
to
be
a

a

a

were
to
attain
an
equine
perfection
impossible
on

whatever
it
may
be
in
happy
hunting
ground
of
immortality
even
these
one
and
all
of
them
came
eager
to
see
the
running
for
the
gilt
vase
for
it
was
known
very
well
that
the
guards
had
backed
their
horse
tremendously
and
the
county
laid
most
of
its
money
on
him
and
the
bookmakers
were
shy
of
laying
off
much
against
one
of
the
first
riders
of
the
service
who
had
landed
his
mount
at
the
grand
national
handicap
the
billesdon
coplow
the
ealing
the
curragh
the
prix
du

the

and
almost
every

for
which
he
had
entered
yet
despite
this
the
fancy
took
most
to
bay
regent
they
thought
he
would
cut
the
work
out
his
sire
had
won
the
champion
stakes
at
doncaster
and
the
at
glorious
goodwood
and
that
racing
strain
through
the
white
lily
blood
coupled
with
a
magnificent
reputation
which
he
brought
from
leicestershire
as
a
fencer
found
him
chief
favor
among
the
fraternity
his
jockey
jimmy
delmar
too
with
his
bronzed
muscular
sinewy
frame
his
low
stature
his
light
weight
his
sunburnt
acute
face
and
a
way
of
carrying
his
hands
as
he
rode
that
was
precisely
like
aldcroft
looked
a
hundred
times
more
professional
than
the
brilliance
of
beauty
and
the
reckless
dash
of
his
way
of
sending
the
horse
along
with
all
he
had
in
him
which
was
undeniably
much
more
like
a
fast
kill
over
the
melton
country
than
like
a
race
anywhere
you
see
the
service
in
his
stirrups
said
an
old
nobbler
who
had
watched
many
a
trial
spin
lying
hidden
in
a
ditch
or
a
drain
and
indisputably
you
did
bertie
riding
was
superb
but
it
was
still
the
riding
of
a
cavalryman
not
of
a
jockey
the
mere
turn
of
the
foot
in
the
stirrups
told
it
as
the
old
man
had
the
shrewdness
to
know
so
the
king
went
down
at
one
time
two
points
in
the
morning
betting
know
them
flash
cracks
of
the
household
said
tim
varnet
as
sharp
a
little
leg
as
ever
got
on
a
dark
thing
and
went
halves
with
a
jock
who
consented
to
rope
a
favorite
at
the
ducal
them
swells
ye
see
they
give
any
money
for
blood
they
just
go
by
godolphin
heads
and
little
feet
and
winners
strains
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
so
long
as
they
get
pedigree
never
look
at
substance
and
their
bone
comes
no
bigger
than
a
deer
now
it
force
as
well
as
pace
that
tells
over
a
bit
of
plow
a
critter
that
would
win
the
derby
on
the
flat
would
knock
up
over
the
first
spin
over
the
clods
and
that
king
legs
are
too
light
for
my
fancy
as
is
ondeniable
he
looks
for
a
little
as
one
may
and
tim
varnet
exactly
expressed
the
dominant
mistrust
of
the
talent
despite
all
his
race
and
all
his
exploits
the
king
was
not
popular
in
the
ring
because
he
was
like
his
backers
a
they
thought
him
showy
very
showy
a
picture
to
frame
a
luster
to
look
at
but
they
disbelieved
in
him
almost
to
a
man
as
a
stayer
and
they
trusted
him
scarcely
at
all
with
their
money
it
plain
that
he
though
thought
little
tim
who
was
so
used
to
the
shady
in
stable
matters
that
he
could
hardly
persuade
himself
that
even
the
grand
military
could
be
run
fair
and
would
have
thought
a
guardsman
or
a
hussar
only
exercised
his
just
privilege
as
a
jockey
in
roping
after
selling
the
race
if
so
it
suited
his
book
he
that
clear
the
swells
have
put
all
their
pots
on
him
but
if
the
pots
do
bile
over
strike
me
a
loser
a
contingency
he
knew
he
might
very
well
invoke
his
investments
being
invariably
so
matchlessly
arranged
that
let
what
would
be
bowled
over
tim
varnet
never
could
be
whatever
the
king
might
prove
however
the
guards
the
flower
of
the
service
must
stand
or
fall
by
him
they
had
not
seraph
they
put
in
beauty
and
his
gray
but
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
tremendousness
of
the
struggle
lying
before
him
the
running
ground
covered
four
miles
and
a
half
and
had
jumps
in
it
exclusive
of
the
famous
brixworth
half
was
grassland
and
half
ridge
and
furrow
a
lane
with
very
awkward
double
fences
laced
in
and
in
with
the
memorable
blackthorn
a
laid
hedge
with
thick
growers
in
it
and
many
another
teaser
coupled
with
the
yawning
water
made
the
course
a
severe
one
while
starters
of
unusual
excellence
gave
a
good
field
and
promised
a
close
race
every
fine
bit
of
blood
that
was
to
be
found
in
their
studs
the
service
had
brought
together
for
the
great
event
and
if
the
question
could
ever
be
solved
whether
it
is
possible
to
find
a
strain
that
shall
combine
pace
over
the
flat
with
the
heart
to
stay
over
an
inclosed
country
the
speed
to
race
with
the
bottom
to
fence
and
the
force
to
clear
water
it
seemed
likely
to
be
settled
now
the
service
and
the
stable
had
done
their
uttermost
to
reach
its
solution
the
clock
of
the
course
pointed
to
one
the
saddling
bell
would
ring
at
a
quarter
to
two
for
the
days
were
short
and
darkened
early
the
stewards
were
all
arrived
except
the
marquis
of
rockingham
and
the
ring
was
in
the
full
rush
of
excitement
some
getting
on
hurriedly
to
make
up
for
lost
time
some
peppering
one
or
other
of
the
favorites
hotly
some
laying
off
their
moneys
in
a
cold
fit
of
caution
some
putting
capfuls
on
the
king
or
bay
regent
or
pas
de
charge
from
the
great
commission
stables
the
local
betting
man
the
shrewd
wiseacres
from
the
ridings
all
the
rest
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
turf
were
crowding
together
with
the
deafening
shouting
common
to
them
which
sounds
so
tumultuous
so
insane
and
so
unintelligible
to
outsiders
amid
them
half
the
titled
heads
of
england
all
the
great
names
known
on
the

men
in

all
the

that
had
sent
their
first
riders
to
try
for
the
blue
ribbon
were
backing
their
horses
with
crackers
and
jotting
down
figure
after
figure
with
jeweled
pencils
in
dainty
books
taking
long
odds
with
the
fields
carriages
were
standing
in
long
lines
along
the
course
the
stands
were
filled
with
almost
as
bright
a
bevy
of
fashionable
loveliness
as
the
ducal
brings
together
under
the
park
trees
of
goodwood
the
horses
were
being
led
into
the
inclosure
for
saddling
a
brilliant
sun
shone
for
the
nonce
on
the
freshest
of
february
noons
beautiful
women
were
fluttering
out
of
their
barouches
in
furs
and
velvets
wearing
the
colors
of
the
jockey
they
favored
and
more
predominant
than
any
were
cecil
scarlet
and
white
only
rivaled
in
prominence
by
the
azure
of
the
heavy
cavalry
champion
sir

montacute
a
drag
with
four
bays
with
fine
hunting
points
about
them
had
dashed
up
late
of
course
the
seraph
had
swung
himself
from
the
into
the
saddle
of
his
hack
one
of
these
few
rare
hacks
that
are
perfect
and
combine
every
excellence
of
pace
bone
and
action
under
their
modest
appellative
and
had
cantered
off
to
join
the
stewards
while
cecil
had
gone
up
to
a
group
of
ladies
in
the
grand
stand
as
if
he
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
morning
business
than
they
right
in
front
of
that
stand
was
an
artificial
bullfinch
that
promised
to
treat
most
of
the
field
to
a
purler
a
deep
ditch
dug
and
filled
with
water
with
two
towering
blackthorn
fences
on
either
side
of
it
as
awkward
a
leap
as
the
most
cramped
country
ever
showed
some
were
complaining
of
it
it
was
too
severe
it
was
unfair
it
would
break
the
back
of
every
horse
sent
at
it
the
other
stewards
were
not
unwilling
to
have
it
tamed
down
a
little
but
he
seraph
generally
the
easiest
of
all
creatures
refused
resolutely
to
let
it
be
touched
look
here
said
he
confidentially
as
he
wheeled
his
hack
round
to
the
stand
and
beckoned
cecil
down
look
here
beauty
they
wanting
to
alter
that
teaser
make
it
less
awkward
you
know
but
i
because
i
thought
it
would
look
as
if
i
lessened
it
for
you
you
know
still
it
is
a
cracker
and
no
mistake
brixworth
itself
is
nothing
to
it
and
if
you
like
it
toned
down
i
let
them
do
it
my
dear
seraph
not
for
worlds
you
were
quite
right
not
to
have
a
thorn
taken
down
why
that
where
i
shall
thrash
bay
regent
said
bertie
serenely
as
if
the
winning
of
the
stakes
had
been
forecast
in
his
horoscope
the
seraph
whistled
stroking
his
mustaches
between
ourselves
cecil
that
fellow
is
going
up
no
end
the
talent
fancy
him
so
let
them
said
cecil
placidly
with
a
great
cheroot
in
his
mouth
lounging
into
the
center
of
the
ring
to
hear
how
the
betting
went
on
his
own
mount
perfectly
regardless
that
he
would
keep
them
waiting
at
the
weights
while
he
dressed
everybody
there
knew
him
by
name
and
sight
and
eager
glances
followed
the
tall
form
of
the
guards
champion
as
he
moved
through
the
press
in
a
loose
brown
sealskin
coat
with
a
little
strip
of
scarlet
ribbon
round
his
throat
nodding
to
this
peer
taking
evens
with
that
exchanging
a
whisper
with
a
duke
and
squaring
his
book
with
a
jew
murmurs
followed
about
him
as
if
he
were
the
horse
himself
looks
in
racing
form
looks
used
up
to
me
too
little
hands
surely
to
hold
in
long
in
a
spin
too
much
length
in
the
limbs
for
a
light
weight
bone
always
awfully
heavy
dark
under
the
eye
been
going
too
fast
for
training
a
swell
all
over
but
rides
no
end
with
other
innumerable
contradictory
phrases
according
as
the
speaker
was
on
him
or
against
him
buzzed
about
him
from
the
of
the
ring
in
no
way
disturbing
his
serene
equanimity
one
man
a
big
fellow
all
over
with
the
genuine
sporting
coat
and
a
superabundance
of
showy
necktie
and
bad
jewelry
eyed
him
curiously
and
slightly
turned
so
that
his
back
was
toward
bertie
as
the
latter
was
entering
a
bet
with
another
guardsman
well
known
on
the
turf
and
he
himself
was
taking
long
odds
with
little
berk
cecil
the
boy
having
betted
on
his
brother
riding
as
though
he
had
the
bank
of
england
at
his
back
indeed
save
that
the
lad
had
the
hereditary
royallieu
instinct
of
extravagance
and
with
a
half
thoughtless
half
willful
improvidence
piled
debts
and
difficulties
on
this
rather
brainless
and
boyish
head
he
had
much
more
to
depend
on
than
his
elder
old
lord
royallieu
doted
on
him
spoilt
him
and
denied
him
nothing
though
himself
a
stern
austere
passionate
man
made
irascible
by
ill
health
and
in
his
fits
of
anger
a
very
terrible
personage
indeed
no
more
to
be
conciliated
by
persuasion
than
iron
is
to
be
bent
by
the
hand
so
terrible
that
even
his
pet
dreaded
him
mortally
and
came
to
bertie
to
get
his
imprudences
and
peccadilloes
covered
from
the
viscount
sight
glancing
round
at
this
moment
as
he
stood
in
the
ring
cecil
saw
the
betting
man
with
whom
berkeley
was
taking
long
odds
on
the
race
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
his
face
darkened
for
a
second
though
resuming
its
habitual
listless
serenity
almost
immediately
you
remember
that
case
of
welshing
after
the
ebor
leger
con
he
said
in
a
low
tone
to
the
earl
of
constantia
with
whom
he
was
talking
the
earl
nodded
assent
everyone
had
heard
of
it
and
a
very
flagrant
case
it
was
there
the
fellow
said
cecil
laconically
and
strode
toward
him
with
his
long
lounging
cavalry
swing
the
man
turned
pallid
under
his
florid
skin
and
tried
to
edge
imperceptibly
away
but
the
density
of
the
throng
prevented
his
moving
quickly
enough
to
evade
cecil
who
stooped
his
head
and
said
a
word
in
his
ear
it
was
briefly
leave
the
the
rascal
half
bully
half
coward
rallied
from
the
startled
fear
into
which
his
first
recognition
by
the
guardsman
who
had
been
the
chief
witness
against
him
in
a
very
scandalous
matter
at
york
and
who
had
warned
him
that
if
he
ever
saw
him
again
in
the
ring
he
would
have
him
turned
out
of
it
had
thrown
him
and
relying
on
insolence
and
the
numbers
of
his
fraternity
to
back
him
out
of
it
stood
his
ground
i
as
much
right
here
as
you
swells
he
said
with
a
hoarse
laugh
are
you
the
whole
jockey
club
that
you
come
it
to
a
honest
gentleman
like
that
cecil
looked
down
on
him
slightly
amused
immeasurably
disgusted
of
all
earth
terrors
there
was
not
one
so
great
for
him
as
a
scene
and
the
eager
bloodshot
eyes
of
the
ring
were
turning
on
them
by
the
thousand
and
the
loud
shouting
of
the
bookmakers
was
thundering
out
what
up
my
gentleman
he
said
wearily
leave
this
i
tell
you
do
you
hear
make
me
retorted
the
welsher
defiant
in
his
square
strength
and
ready
to
brazen
the
matter
out
make
me
my
cock
o
fine
feathers
put
me
out
of
the
ring
if
you
can
dainty
limbs
i
as
much
business
here
as
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
light
as
a
deer
and
close
as
steel
cecil
hand
was
on
his
collar
and
without
any
seeming
effort
without
the
slightest
passion
he
calmly
lifted
him
off
the
ground
as
though
he
were
a
terrier
and
thrust
him
through
the
throng
ben
davis
as
the
welsher
was
named
meantime
being
so
amazed
at
such
might
in
the
grasp
of
the
gentlest
idlest
most
gracefully
made
and
indolently
tempered
of
his
born
foes
and
prey
the
swells
that
he
let
himself
be
forced
along
backward
in
sheer
passive
paralysis
of
astonishment
while
bertie
profoundly
insensible
to
the
tumult
that
began
to
rise
and
roar
about
him
from
those
who
were
not
too
absorbed
in
the
business
of
the
morning
to
note
what
took
place
thrust
him
along
in
the
single
clasp
of
his
right
hand
outward
to
where
the
running
ground
swept
past
the
stand
and
threw
him
lightly
easily
just
as
one
may
throw
a
to
take
his
bath
into
the
artificial
ditch
filled
with
water
that
the
seraph
had
pointed
out
as
a
the
man
fell
unhurt
unbruised
so
gently
was
he
dropped
on
his
back
among
the
muddy
chilly
water
and
the
overhanging
brambles
and
as
he
rose
from
the
ducking
a
shudder
of
ferocious
and
filthy
oaths
poured
from
his
lips
increased
tenfold
by
the
uproarious
laughter
of
the
crowd
who
knew
him
as
a
welsher
and
thought
him
only
too
well
served
policemen
rushed
in
at
all
points
rural
and
metropolitan
breathless
austere
and
of
course
too
late
bertie
turned
to
them
with
a
slight
wave
of
his
hand
to
sign
them
away
do
trouble
yourselves
it
nothing
you
could
interfere
in
take
care
that
person
does
come
into
the
betting
ring
again
that
the
seraph
lord
constantia
wentworth
and
may
others
of
his
set
catching
sight
of
the
turmoil
and
of
beauty
with
the
great
figure
of
ben
davis
pressed
before
him
through
the
mob
forced
their
way
up
as
quickly
as
they
could
but
before
they
reached
the
spot
cecil
was
sauntering
back
to
meet
them
cool
and
listless
and
a
little
bored
with
so
much
exertion
his
cheroot
in
his
mouth
and
his
ear
serenely
deaf
to
the
clamor
about
the
ditch
he
looked
apologetically
at
the
seraph
and
the
others
he
felt
some
apology
was
required
for
having
so
far
wandered
from
all
the
canons
of
his
order
as
to
have
approached
a
row
and
run
the
risk
of
a
scene
turf
must
be
cleared
of
these
scamps
you
see
he
said
with
a
half
sigh
law
ca
do
anything
fellow
was
trying
to
on
with
the
young
one
too
do
bet
with
those
berk
the
great
bookmakers
will
make
you
dead
money
and
the
little
legs
will
do
worse
to
the
boy
hung
his
head
but
looked
sulky
rather
than
thankful
for
his
brother
interference
with
himself
and
the
welsher
you
have
done
the
turf
a
service
beauty
a
very
great
service
no
doubt
about
that
said
the
seraph
law
ca
do
anything
as
you
say
opinion
must
clear
the
ring
of
such
rascals
a
welsher
ought
not
to
dare
to
show
his
face
here
but
at
the
same
time
you
ought
to
have
gone
unsteadying
your
muscle
and
risking
the
firmness
of
your
hand
at
such
a
minute
as
this
with
pitching
that
fellow
over
why
could
you
wait
till
afterward
or
have
let
me
do
it
my
dear
seraph
murmured
bertie
languidly
i
gone
in
for
exertion
a
little
more
or
less
is
nothing
besides
welshers
are
slippery
dogs
you
he
did
not
add
that
it
was
having
seen
ben
davis
taking
odds
with
his
young
brother
which
had
spurred
him
to
such
instantaneous
action
with
that
disreputable
personage
who
beyond
doubt
only
received
a
tithe
part
of
his
deserts
and
merited
to
be
off
every
course
in
the
kingdom
rake
at
that
instant
darted
panting
like
a
hot
retriever
out
of
the
throng
mr
cecil
sir
will
you
please
come
to
the
weights
the
saddling
bell
to
ring
and
tell
them
to
wait
for
me
i
shall
only
be
twenty
minutes
dressing
said
cecil
quietly
regardless
that
the
time
at
which
the
horses
should
have
been
at
the
was
then
clanging
from
the
clock
within
the
grand
stand
did
you
ever
go
to
a
race
where
the
jocks
were
not
at
least
an
hour
behind
time
and
considered
themselves
on
the
whole
very
tolerably
punctual
at
last
however
he
sauntered
into
the
and
was
aided
by
rake
into
tops
that
had
at
length
achieved
a
spotless
triumph
and
the
scarlet
jacket
of
his
fair
friend
art
with
white
hoops
and
the
coeur
vaillant
se
fait
royaume
on
the
collar
and
the
white
gleaming
sash
to
be
worn
across
it
fringed
by
the
same
fair
hands
with
silver
meanwhile
the
welsher
driven
off
the
course
by
a
hooting
and
indignant
crowd
shaking
the
water
from
his
clothes
with
bitter
oaths
and
livid
with
a
deadly
passion
at
his
exile
from
the
of
his
lawless
gleanings
went
his
way
with
a
savage
vow
of
vengeance
against
the
d
d
dandy
the
guards
swell
who
had
shown
him
up
before
the
world
as
the
scoundrel
he
was
the
bell
was
clanging
and
clashing
passionately
as

down
to
the

all
his

of
the

about
him

all
standing
crushers
on
their
champion
for
their
stringent
esprit

was
involved
and
the

are
never
backward
in
putting
their
gold
down
as
all
the
world
knows
in
the
inclosure
the
cynosure
of
devouring
eyes
stood
the
king
with
the
sangfroid
of
a
superb
gentleman
amid
the
clamor
raging
round
him
one
delicate
ear
laid
back
now
and
them
but
otherwise
indifferent
to
the
din
with
his
coat
glistening
like
satin
the
beautiful
tracery
of
vein
and
muscle
like
the
veins
of
standing
out
on
the
glossy
neck
that
had
the
arch
of
circassia
and
his
dark
antelope
eyes
gazing
with
a
gentle
pensive
earnestness
on
the
shouting
crowd
his
rivals
too
were
beyond
par
in
fitness
and
in
condition
and
there
were
magnificent
animals
among
them
bay

was
a
huge
raking
chestnut
upward
of
sixteen
hands
and
enormously
powerful
with
very
fine
shoulders
and
an
head
he
belonged
to
a
colonel
in
the
rifles
but
was
to
be
ridden
by
jimmy

colors
were

which
carried
all
the
money
of
the
heavy

montacute
himself
being
in
the
dragoon
guards
was
of
much
the
same
order
a
black
hunter
with
in
his
loins
and
withers
that
assured
any
amount
of
force
and
no
fault
but
that
of
a
rather
coarse
head
traceable
to
a
slur
on
his
on
the
distaff
side
from
a
plebeian
who
had
been
a
cart
mare
the
only
stain
on
his
otherwise
faultless
pedigree
however
she
had
given
him
her
massive
shoulders
so
that
he
was
in
some
sense
a
gainer
by
her
after
all
wild
geranium
was
a
beautiful
creature
enough
a
bright
bay
irish
mare
with
that
rich
red
gloss
that
is
like
the
glow
of
a
horse
chestnut
very
perfect
in
shape
though
a
trifle
light
perhaps
and
with
not
quite
strength
enough
in
neck
or
barrel
she
would
jump
the
fences
of
her
own
paddock
half
a
dozen
times
a
day
for
sheer
amusement
and
was
game
for
anything
she
was
entered
by
cartouche
of
the
enniskillens
to
be
ridden
by
baby
grafton
of
the
same
corps
a
and
quite
a
boy
but
with
plenty
of
science
in
him
these
were
the
three
favorites

close
the

and
to
be

by

a
handsome

with
ragged

and

looked
a
trifle
but
noble
shoulders
and
great
force
in

loins
and
withers
the
rest
of
the
field
though
unusually
excellent
did
not
find
so
many
sweet
voices
for
them
and
were
not
so
much
to
be
feared
each
starter
was
of
course
much
backed
by
his
party
but
the
betting
was
tolerably
even
on
these
four
all
famous

at
another
slightly
leading
in
the
ring
the
portrait
of
this
lady
is
that
of
a
very
esteemed
young
irish
beauty
of
my
acquaintance
she
this
season
did
miles
on
a
warm
june
day
and
ate
her
corn
and
tares
afterward
as
if
nothing
had
happened
she
is
six
years
old
starters
were
hoisted
up
on
the
telegraph
board
and
as
the
field
got
at
last
underway
uncommonly
handsome
they
looked
while
the
silk
jackets
of
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
glittered
in
the
bright
as
forest
king
closed
in
perfectly
tranquil
still
but
beginning
to
glow
and
quiver
all
over
with
excitement
knowing
as
well
as
his
rider
the
work
that
was
before
him
and
longing
for
it
in
every
muscle
and
every
limb
while
his
eyes
flashed
fire
as
he
pulled
at
the
curb
and
tossed
his
head
aloft
there
went
up
a
general
shout

beauty

on

and
even
somewhat
on
the
professionals
though
his
legs
kept
a
strong
business
prejudice
against
the
working
powers
of
the
guards
the
ladies
began
to
lay
dozens
in
gloves
on
him
not
altogether
for
his
points
which
perhaps
they
hardly
appreciated
but
for
his
owner
and
rider
who
in
the
scarlet
and
gold
with
the
white
sash
across
his
chest
and
a
look
of
serene
indifference
on
his
face

lengthening

gathering
up
all
its

and
its
impetus
for

a

and
with
miraculous
gameness
landed
safely
but
her
hind

slipped
on

with
a
savage
blow
over

the
madness
was
its
own
punishment
the
poor
brute
rose
blindly
to
the
jump
and
missed
the
bank
with
a
reel
and
a
crash
sir

was
hurled
out
into
the
brook
and
the
hope
of
the
heavies
lay
there
with
his
breast
and

resting
on
the

his
hindquarters
in

they

most

out
of

by
the
shock
he
scarcely

a

to
ease
the

and
to
recover
his

then
he
took
the

up
again
as

and
his
comrades
of
the

when
they
saw
this
through

through
their
serenity
and
burst
into
a
cheer
that
echoed
over
the
grasslands
and
the
coppices
like
a

the
grand
rich
voice
of
the
seraph
leading
foremost
and
loudest
a
cheer
that
rolled
mellow
and
triumphant
down
the
cold
bright
air
like
the
blast
of
trumpets
and
thrilled
on

ear
where
he
came
down
the

a
mile
away
it
made
his
heart
beat
quicker
with
a
victorious
headlong
delight
as
his
knees
pressed
close
into
forest
king
flanks
and
half
stirrupless
like
the
arabs
he
thundered
forward
to
the
greatest
riding
feat
of
his
life
his
face
was
very
calm
still
but
his
blood
was
in
tumult
the
delirium
of
pace
had
got
on
him
a
minute
of
life
like
this
was
worth
a
year
and
he
knew
that
he
would
win
or
die
for
it
as
the
land
seemed
to
fly
like
a
black
sheet
under
him
and
in
that
killing
speed
fence
and
hedge
and
double
and
water
all
went
by
him
like
a
dream
whirling
underneath
him
as
the
gray
stretched
stomach
to
earth
over
the
level
and
rose
to
leap
after
leap
for
that
instant
pause
when
the
stirrup
broke
threatened
to
lose
him
the
race
he
was
more
than
a
length
behind
the
regent
whose
hoofs
as
they
dashed
the
ground
up
sounded
like
thunder
and
for
whose
herculean
strength
the
plow
had
no
terrors
it
was
more
than
the
lead
to
keep
now
there
was
ground
to
cover
and
the
king
was
losing
like
wild
geranium
cecil
felt
drunk
with
that
strong
keen

that
blew
so
strongly
in

a
passionate
excitation
was
in
him
every
breath
of
winter
air
that
rushed
in
its
bracing
currents
round
him
seemed
to
lash
him
like
a
stripe
the
household
to
look
on
and
see
him
beaten
certain
wild
blood
that
lay
latent
in
cecil
under
the
tranquil
gentleness
of
temper
and
of
custom
woke
and
had
the
mastery
he
set
his
teeth
hard
and
his
hands
clinched
like
steel
on
the
bridle
oh
my
beauty
my
beauty
he
cried
all
unconsciously
half
aloud
as
they
cleared
the
fence

me
if
you
like
but
do
fail
me
as
though
forest

the

the
splendid

faster
out
the

stretched
farther
yet
with
lightning
spontaneity
every

a
race
once
more
across
the
three
meadows
with
the
last
and
lower
fences
that
were
between
them
and
the
final
leap
of
all
that
ditch
of
artificial
water
with
the
towering
double
hedge
of
oak
rails
and
of
blackthorn
that
was
reared
black
and
grim
and
hopeless
just
in
front
of
the
grand
stand
a
roar
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
broke
up
from
the
thronged
course
as
the
crowd
hung
breathless
on
the
even
race
ten
thousand
shouts
rang
as
thrice
ten
thousand
eyes
watched
the
closing
contest
as
superb
a
sight
as
the
shires

saw
while
the
two
ran
together
the
gigantic
chestnut
with
every
massive
sinew
swelled
and
strained
to
tension

the
marvelous
grace
the
shining

along
at

that
epsom

never
eclipsed
sweeping
by
the
grand
stand
like
the
flash
of
electric
flame
they
ran
side
to
side
one
moment
more
their
foam
flung
on
each
other
withers
their
breath
hot
in
each
other
nostrils
while
the
dark
earth
flew
beneath
their
stride
the
blackthorn
was
in

behind
five
bars
of
solid
oak
the
water
yawning
on
its
farther
side
black
and
deep
and
fenced
twelve
feet
wide
if
it
were
an

pressed
his

closer
and
closer
and
worked
the
gallant

for
the
test
the
surging
roar
of
the
throng
though
so
close
was
dull
on
his
ear
he
heard
nothing
knew
nothing
saw
nothing
but
that
lean
chestnut
head
beside
him
the
dull
thud
on
the
turf
of
the
flying
gallop
and
the
black
wall
that
reared
in
his
face
forest
king
had
done
so
much
could
he
have
stay
and
strength
for
this
cecil
hands
clinched
unconsciously
on
the
bridle
and
his
face
was
very
pale
pale
with
excitation
as
his
foot
where
the
stirrup
was
broken
crushed
closer
and
harder
against
the
gray
flanks
oh
my
darling
my
beauty
now
one
touch
of
the
spur
the
first
and
forest
king
rose
at
the
leap
all
the
life
and
power
there
were
in
him
gathered
for
one
superhuman
and
crowning
effort
a
flash
of
time
not
half
a
second
in
duration
and
he
was
lifted
in
the
air
higher
and
higher
and
higher
in
the
cold
fresh
wild
winter
wind
stakes
and
rails
and
thorn
and
water
lay
beneath
him
black
and
gaunt
and
shapeless
yawning
like
a
grave
one
bound
even
in
one
last
convulsive
impulse
of
the
gathered
limbs
and
forest
king
was
over
and
as
he
galloped
up
the
straight
he
was
alone
bay
regent
had
refused
the
leap
as
the
gray
swept
to
the
judge
chair
the
air
was
rent
with
deafening
cheers
that
seemed
to
reel
like
drunken
shouts
from
the
multitude
the
guards
win
the
guards
win
and
when
his
rider
pulled
up
at
the
distance
with
the
full
sun
shining
on
the
scarlet
and
white
with
the
gold
glisten
of
the
embroidered

forest
king
stood
in
all
his
glory
winner
of
the
soldiers
blue
ribbon
by
a
feat
without
its
parallel
in
all
the
annals
of
the
gold
vase
but
as
the
crowd
surged
about
him
and
the
mad
cheering
crowned
his
victory
and
the
household
in
the
splendor
of
their
triumph
and
the
fullness
of
their
gratitude
rushed
from
the
drags
and
the
stands
to
cluster
to
his
saddle
bertie
looked
as
serenely
and
listlessly
nonchalant
as
of
old
while
he
nodded
to
the
seraph
with
a
gentle
smile
rather
a
close
finish
eh
have
you
any
moselle
cup
going
there
i
a
little
outsiders
would
much
sooner
have
thought
him
defeated
than
triumphant
no
one
who
had
not
known
him
could
possibly
have
imagined
that
he
had
been
successful
an
ordinary
spectator
would
have
concluded
that
judging
by
the
resigned
weariness
of
his
features
he
had
won
the
race
greatly
against
his
own
will
and
to
his
own
infinite
ennui
no
one
could
have
dreamt
that
he
was
thinking
in
his
heart
of
hearts
how
passionately
he
loved
the
gallant
beast
that
had
been
victor
with
him
and
that
if
he
had
followed
out
the
momentary
impulse
in
him
he
could
have
put
his
arms
round
the
noble
bowed
neck
and
kissed
the
horse
like
a
woman
the
moselle
cup
was
brought
to
refresh
the
tired
champion
and
before
he
drank
it
bertie
glanced
at
a
certain
place
in
the
grand
stand
and
bent
his
head
as
the
cup
touched
his
lips
it
was
a
dedication
of
his
victory
to
the
queen
of
beauty
then
he
threw
himself
lightly
out
of
saddle
and
as
forest
king
was
led
away
for
the
of
bottling
rubbing
and
clothing
his
rider
regardless
of
the
roar
and
hubbub
of
the
course
and
of
the
tumultuous
cheers
that
welcomed
both
him
and
his
horse
from
the
men
who
pressed
round
him
into
whose
pockets
he
had
put
thousands
upon
thousands
and
whose
ringing
hurrahs
greeted
the
crack
passed
straight
up
toward
jimmy
delmar
and
held
out
his
hand
you
gave
me
a
close
thing
major
delmar
the
vase
is
as
much
yours
as
mine
if
your
chestnut
had
been
as
good
a
water
jumper
as
he
is
a
fencer
we
should
have
been
neck
to
neck
at
the
the
browned
face
of
the
lancer
broke
up
into
a
cordial
smile
and
he
shook
the
hand
held
out
to
him
warmly
defeat
and
disappointment
had
cut
him
to
the
core
for
jimmy
was
the
first
riding
man
of
the
light
cavalry
but
he
would
not
have
been
the
frank
campaigner
that
he
was
if
he
had
not
responded
to
the
graceful
and
generous
overture
of
his
rival
and
conqueror
oh
i
can
take
a
beating
he
said
at
any
rate
i
am
beat
by
the
guards
and
it
is
very
little
humiliation
to
lose
against
such
riding
as
yours
and
such
a
magnificent
brute
as
your
king
i
congratulate
you
most
heartily
most
and
he
meant
it
too
jimmy
never
canted
nor
did
he
ever
throw
the
blame
with
paltry
savage
vindictiveness
on
the
horse
he
had
ridden
some
men
there
are
their
name
is
legion
who
never
allow
that
it
is
their
fault
when
they
are
nowhere
oh
no
it
is
the
cursed
screw
always
according
to
them
but
a
very
good
rider
will
not
tell
you
that
cecil
while
he
talked
was
glancing
up
at
the
grand
stand
and
when
the
others
dispersed
to
look
over
the
horses
and
he
had
put
himself
out
of
his
shell
into
his
sealskin
in
the
he
went
up
thither
without
a
moment
loss
of
time
he
knew
them
all
those
dainty
beauties
with
their
delicate
cheeks
just
brightened
by
the
western
winterly
wind
and
their
rich
furs
and
laces
glowing
among
the
colors
of
their
respective
heroes
he
was
the
pet
of
them
all
beauty
had
the
suffrages
of
the
sex
without
exception
he
was
received
with
bright
smiles
and
graceful
congratulations
even
from
those
who
had
espoused
eyre
montacute
cause
and
still
fluttered
their
losing
azure
though
the
poor
hunter
lay
dead
with
his
back
broken
and
a
mercifully
sent
through
his
brains
the
martyr
to
a
hot
haste
as
the
dumb
things
have
ever
been
since
creation
began
cecil
passed
them
as
rapidly
as
he
could
for
one
so
well
received
by
them
and
made
his
way
to
the
center
of
the
stand
to
the
same
spot
at
which
he
had
glanced
when
he
had
drunk
the
moselle
a
lady
turned
to
him
she
looked
like
a
rose
camellia
in
her
floating
scarlet
and
white
just
toned
down
and
made
perfect
by
a
shower
of
spanish
lace
a
beautiful
brunette
dashing
yet
delicate
a
little
fast
yet
intensely
thoroughbred
a
coquette
who
would
smoke
a
cigarette
yet
a
peeress
who
would
never
lose
her
dignity
au
coeur
vaillant
rien
she
said
with
an
envoi
of
her
lorgnon
and
a
smile
that
should
have
intoxicated
him
a
smile
that
might
have
rewarded
a
richepanse
for
a
hohenlinden
superbly
ridden
i
absolutely
trembled
for
you
as
you
lifted
the
king
to
that
last
leap
it
was
terrible
it
was
terrible
and
a
woman
to
say
nothing
of
a
woman
who
was
in
love
with
him
might
well
have
felt
a
fear
at
sight
of
that
yawning
water
and
those
towering
walls
of
blackthorn
where
one
touch
of
the
hoofs
on
the
topmost
bough
one
spring
too
short
of
the
gathered
limbs
must
have
been
death
to
both
horse
and
rider
but
as
she
said
it
she
was
smiling
radiant
full
of
easy
calm
and
racing
interest
as
became
her
ladyship
who
had
had
bets
at
even
before
now
on
goodwood
fillies
and
could
lead
the
first
flight
over
the
belvoir
and
the
quorn
countries
it
was
possible
that
her
ladyship
was
too
thoroughbred
not
to
see
a
man
killed
over
the
without
deviating
into
unseemly
emotion
or
being
capable
of
such
bad
style
as
to
be
agitated
bertie
however
in
answer
threw
the
tenderest
eloquence
into
his
eyes
very
learned
in
such
eloquence
if
i
could
not
have
been
victorious
while
you
looked
on
i
would
at
least
not
have
lived
to
meet
you
here
she
laughed
a
little
so
did
he
they
were
used
to
exchange
these
passages
in
an
admirably
artistic
masquerade
but
it
was
always
a
little
droll
to
each
of
them
to
see
the
other
wear
the
domino
of
sentiment
and
neither
had
much
credence
in
the
other
what
a
preux
chevalier
cried
his
queen
of
beauty
you
would
have
died
in
a
ditch
out
of
homage
to
me
who
shall
say
that
chivalry
is
past
tell
me
bertie
is
it
very
delightful
that
desperate
effort
to
break
your
neck
it
looks
pleasant
to
judge
by
its
effects
it
is
the
only
thing
in
the
world
that
amuses
you
well
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
it
replied
bertie
musingly
you
see
until
one
has
broken
one
neck
the
excitement
of
the
thing
is
totally
worn
out
ca
be
naturally
because
the
consummation
is
attained
till
then
the
worst
of
it
is
it
getting
commonplace
getting
vulgar
such
a
number
break
their
necks
doing
alps
and
that
sort
of
thing
that
we
shall
have
nothing
at
all
left
to
ourselves
not
even
the

languid
laugh
in
the

that
it
had
a

murmured
cecil
with
the
softest
tenderness
but
just
enough
laziness
in
the
tone
and
laughter
in
the
eye
to
make
it
highly
doubtful
whether
he
was
not
laughing
both
at
her
and
at
himself
and
was
wondering
why
the
deuce
a
fellow
had
to
talk
such
nonsense
yet
she
was
lady

with
whom
he
had
been
in

ever
since
they
stayed
together
at
belvoir
for
the

the
autumn
previous
and
who
was
beautiful
enough
to
make
their
friendship
as
enchanting
as

fashion
that

looking
down
into

can
no
more
arrest
themselves
than
the
can
pull
in
the
lightning
stride
of
the
who
defies
all
check
and
takes
the
flat
as
he
chooses
they
are
brought
up
like
young
dauphins
and
tossed
into
the
costly
whirl
to
float
as
best
they
can
on
nothing
then
on
the
lives
and
deaths
that
follow
on
the
graves
where
a
dishonored
alien
lies
forgotten
by
the
dark
austrian
lakeside
or
under
the
monastic
shadow
of
some
crumbling
spanish
crypt
where
a
red
cross
chills
the
lonely
traveler
in
the
virgin
solitudes
of
amazonian
forest
aisles
or
the
wild
scarlet
creepers
of
australia
trail
over
a
nameless
mound
above
the
trackless
stretch
of
waters
then
at
them
the
world
shoots
out
its
lips
with
not
on
them
lies
the
blame
a
wintry
watery
sun
was
shining
on
the
terraces
as
lord
royallieu
paced
up
and
down
the
morning
after
the
grand
military
his
step
and
limbs
excessively
enfeebled
but
the
carriage
of
his
head
and
the
flash
of
his
dark
hawk
eyes
as
proud
and
untamable
as
in
his
earliest
years
he
never
left
his
own
apartments
and
no
one
save
his
favorite
little
berk
ever
went
to
him
without
his
desire
he
was
too
sensitive
a
man
to
thrust
his
age
and
ailing
health
in
among
the
young
leaders
of
fashion
the
wild
men
of
pleasure
the
good
wits
and
the
good
shots
of
his
son
set
he
knew
very
well
that
his
own
day
was
past
that
they
would
have
listened
to
him
out
of
the
patience
of
courtesy
but
that
they
would
have
wished
him
away
as
no
end
of
a
he
was
too
shrewd
not
to
know
this
but
he
was
too
quickly
galled
ever
to
bear
to
have
it
recalled
to
him
he
looked
up
suddenly
and
sharply
coming
toward
him
he
saw
the
figure
of
the
guardsman
for
beauty
the
viscount
had
no
love
indeed
a
hatred
for
a
reason
never
guessed
by
others
and
never
betrayed
by
him
bertie
was
not
like
the
royallieu
race
he
resembled
his
family
she
a
beautiful
and
fragile
creature
whom
her
second
son
had
loved
for
the
first
years
of
his
life
as
he
would
have
thought
it
now
impossible
that
he
could
love
anyone
had
married
the
viscount
with
no
affection
toward
him
while
he
had
adored
her
with
a
fierce
and
jealous
passion
that
her
indifference
only
inflamed
throughout
her
married
life
however
she
had
striven
to
render
loyalty
and
tenderness
toward
a
lord
into
whose
arms
she
had
been
thrown
trembling
and
reluctant
of
his
wife
fidelity
he
could
not
entertain
a
doubt
though
that
he
had
never
won
her
heart
he
could
not
choose
but
know
he
knew
more
too
for
she
had
told
it
him
with
a
noble
candor
before
he
wedded
her
knew
that
the
man
she
did
love
was
a
penniless
cousin
a
cavalry
officer
who
had
made
a
famous
name
among
the
wild
mountain
tribes
of
northern
india
this
cousin
alan
bertie
a
fearless
and
chivalrous
soldier
fitter
for
the
days
of
knighthood
than
for
these
had
seen
lady
royallieu
at
nice
some
three
years
after
her
marriage
accident
had
thrown
them
across
each
other
path
the
old
love
stronger
perhaps
now
than
it
had
ever
been
had
made
him
linger
in
her
presence
had
made
her
shrink
from
sending
him
to
exile
evil
tongues
at
last
had
united
their
names
together
alan
bertie
had
left
the
woman
he
idolized
lest
slander
should
touch
her
through
him
and
fallen
two
years
later
under
the
dark
dank
forests
on
the
desolate
of
the
hills
of
hindostan
where
long
before
he
had
rendered
bertie
horse
the
most
famous
of
all
the
wild
irregulars
of
the
east
after
her
death
lord
royallieu
found
alan
miniature
among
her
papers
and
recalled
those
winter
months
by
the
mediterranean
till
he
cherished
with
the
fierce
eager
of
a
jealous
nature
doubts
and
suspicions
that
during
her
life
one
glance
from
her
eyes
would
have
disarmed
and
abashed
her
second
and
favorite
child
bore
her
family
name
her
late
lover
name
and
in
resembling
her
race
resembled
the
dead
soldier
it
was
sufficient
to
make
him
hate
bertie
with
a
cruel
and
savage
detestation
which
he
strove
indeed
to
temper
for
he
was
by
nature
a
just
man
and
in
his
better
moments
knew
that
his
doubts
wronged
both
the
living
and
the
dead
but
which
colored
too
strongly
to
be
dissembled
all
his
feelings
and
his
actions
toward
his
son
and
might
both
have
soured
and
wounded
any
temperament
less
nonchalantly
gentle
and
supremely
careless
than
cecil
as
it
was
bertie
was
sometimes
surprised
at
his
father
dislike
to
him
but
never
thought
much
about
it
and
attributed
it
when
he
did
think
of
it
to
the
caprices
of
a
tyrannous
old
man
to
be
jealous
of
the
favor
shown
to
his
boyish
brother
could
never
for
a
moment
have
come
into
his
imagination
lady
royallieu
with
her
last
words
had
left
the
little
fellow
a
child
of
three
years
old
in
the
affection
and
the
care
of
bertie
himself
then
a
boy
of
twelve
or
fourteen
and
little
as
he
thought
of
such
things
now
the
trust
of
his
dying
mother
had
never
been
wholly
forgotten
a
heavy
gloom
came
now
over
the
viscount
still
handsome
aquiline
saturnine
face
as
his
second
son
approached
up
the
terrace
bertie
was
too
like
the
cavalry
soldier
whose
form
he
had
last
seen
standing
against
the
rose
light
of
a
mediterranean
sunset
the
soldier
had
been
dead
years
but
the
jealous
hate
was
not
dead
yet
cecile
took
off
his
with
a
courtesy
that
sat
very
well
on
his
habitual
languid
nonchalance
he
never
called
his
father
anything
but
royal
rarely
saw
still
less
rarely
consulted
him
and
cared
not
a
straw
for
his
censure
or
opinion
but
he
was
too
thoroughbred
by
nature
to
be
able
to
follow
the
underbred
indecorum
of
the
day
which
makes
disrespect
to
old
age
the
fashion
you
sent
for
me
he
asked
taking
the
cigarette
out
of
his
mouth
no
sir
answered
the
old
lord
curtly
i
sent
for
your
brother
the
fools
ca
take
even
a
message
right
now
it
should
have
named
us
so
near
alike
it
often
a
bore
said
bertie
i
did
name
you
sir
your
mother
named
you
answered
his
father
sharply
the
subject
irritated
him
it
of
no
consequence
which
murmured
cecil
with
an
expostulatory
wave
of
his
cigar
we
not
even
asked
whether
we
like
to
come
into
the
world
we
ca
expect
to
be
asked
what
we
like
to
be
called
in
it
to
you
he
turned
to
move
away
to
the
house
but
his
father
stopped
him
he
knew
that
he
had
been
discourteous
a
far
worse
crime
in
lord
eyes
than
to
be
heartless
so
you
won
the
vase
yesterday
he
asked
pausing
in
his
walk
with
his
back
bowed
but
his
stern
head
erect
i
did
the
king
that
absurd
sir
said
the
viscount
in
his
resonant
and
yet
melodious
voice
the
finest
horse
in
the
world
may
have
his
back
broke
by
bad
riding
and
a
screw
has
won
before
now
when
it
been
finely
handled
the
finish
was
tight
was
it
well
rather
i
have
ridden
closer
spins
though
the
fallows
were
lord
royallieu
smiled
grimly
i
know
what
the
shire
is
like
he
said
with
a
flash
of
his
falcon
eyes
over
the
landscape
where
in
the
days
of
his
youth
he
had
led
the
first
flight
so
often
george
rex
and
waterford
and
the
berkeleys
and
the
rest
following
the
rally
of
his
you
won
much
in
bets
very
fair
and
wo
be
a
shilling
richer
for
it
this
day
next
week
retorted
the
viscount
with
a
rasping
grating
irony
he
could
not
help
darting
savage
thrusts
at
this
man
who
looked
at
him
with
eyes
so
cruelly
like
alan
bertie
you
play
pound
points
and
lay
pounds
on
the
odd
trick
i
heard
at
your
whist
in
the
clubs
pretty
prices
for
a
younger
son
never
bet
on
the
odd
trick
spoils
the
game
makes
you
sacrifice
play
to
the
trick
we
always
bet
on
the
game
said
cecil
with
gentle
weariness
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
was
proof
against
his
attacks
upon
his
patience
no
matter
what
you
bet
sir
you
live
as
if
you
were
a
rothschild
while
you
are
a
beggar
wish
i
were
a
beggar
fellows
always
have
no
end
in
stock
they
say
and
your
tailor
ca
worry
you
very
much
when
all
you
have
to
think
about
is
an
artistic
arrangement
of
tatters
murmured
bertie
whose
impenetrable
serenity
was
never
to
be
ruffled
by
his
bitterness
you
will
soon
have
your
wish
then
retorted
the
viscount
with
the
unprovoked
and
reasonless
passion
which
he
vented
on
everyone
but
on
none
so
much
as
the
son
he
hated
you
are
on
a
royal
road
to
it
i
live
out
of
the
world
but
i
hear
from
it
sir
i
hear
that
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
guards
not
even
lord
rockingham
who
lives
at
the
rate
of
imprudence
you
do
that
there
is
not
a
man
who
drives
such
costly
horses
keeps
such
costly
mistresses
games
to
such
desperation
fools
gold
away
with
such
idiocy
as
you
do
you
conduct
yourself
as
if
you
were
a
millionaire
sir
and
what
are
you
a
pauper
on
my
bounty
and
on
your
brother
montagu
after
me
a
pauper
with
a
tinsel
fashion
a
gilded
beggary
a
queen
commission
to
cover
a
poverty
a
dandy
reputation
to
stave
off
a
defaulter
future
a
pauper
sir
and
a
guardsman
the
coarse
and
cruel
irony
flushed
out
with
wicked
scorching
malignity
lashing
and
upbraiding
the
man
who
was
the
victim
of
his
own
unwisdom
and
extravagance
a
slight
tinge
of
color
came
on
his
son
face
as
he
heard
but
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
was
moved
no
sign
of
impatience
or
anger
he
lifted
his
cap
again
not
in
irony
but
with
a
grave
respect
in
his
action
that
was
totally
contrary
to
his
whole
temperament
this
sort
of
talk
is
very
exhausting
very
bad
style
he
said
with
his
accustomed
gentle
murmur
i
will
bid
you
my
and
he
went
without
another
word
crossing
the
length
of
the
elizabethan
terrace
little
berk
passed
him
he
motioned
the
lad
toward
the
viscount
royal
wants
to
see
you
young
the
boy
nodded
and
went
onward
and
as
bertie
turned
to
enter
the
low
door
that
led
out
to
the
stables
he
saw
his
father
meet
the
lad
meet
him
with
a
smile
that
changed
the
whole
character
of
his
face
and
pleasant
kindly
words
of
affectionate
welcome
drawing
his
arm
about
berkeley
shoulder
and
looking
with
pride
upon
his
bright
and
gracious
youth
more
than
an
old
man
preference
would
be
thus
won
by
the
young
one
a
considerable
portion
of
their
mother
fortune
so
left
that
it
could
not
be
dissipated
yet
could
be
willed
to
which
son
the
viscount
chose
would
go
to
his
brother
by
this
passionate
partiality
but
there
was
not
a
tinge
of
jealousy
in
cecil
whatever
else
his
faults
he
had
no
mean
ones
and
the
boy
was
dear
to
him
by
a
quite
unconscious
yet
unvarying
obedience
to
his
dead
mothers
wish
royal
hates
me
as
hate
a
red
dog
why
the
deuce
i
wonder
he
thought
with
a
certain
slight
touch
of
pain
despite
his
idle
philosophies
and
indifference
well
i
am
good
for
nothing
i
suppose
certainly
i
am
not
good
for
much
unless
it
riding
and
making
with
which
summary
of
his
merits
beauty
who
felt
himself
to
be
a
master
in
those
two
arts
but
thought
himself
a
bad
fellow
out
of
them
sauntered
away
to
join
the
seraph
and
the
rest
of
his
guests
his
father
words
pursuing
him
a
little
despite
his
carelessness
for
they
had
borne
an
unwelcome
measure
of
truth
royal
can
hit
hard
his
thoughts
continued
pauper
and
a
guardsman
by
jove
it
true
enough
but
he
made
me
so
they
brought
me
up
as
if
i
had
a
million
coming
to
me
and
turned
me
out
among
the
cracks
to
take
my
running
with
the
best
of
them
and
they
give
me
just
about
what
pays
my
groom
book
then
they
wonder
that
a
fellow
goes
to
the
jews
where
the
deuce
else
can
he
go
and
bertie
whom
his
gains
the
day
before
had
not
much
benefited
since
his
his
young
brother
needs
and
the
insatiate
little
hands
were
all
stretched
ready
to
devour
them
without
leaving
a
sovereign
for
more
serious
liabilities
went
for
it
was
quite
early
morning
to
act
the
in
his
fathers
stead
at
the
meet
on
the
great
lawns
before
the
house
for
the
royallieu
were
very
famous
in
the
shires
and
hunted
over
the
same
country
alternate
days
with
the
quorn
they
moved
off
ere
long
to
draw
the
holt
wood
in
as
open
a
morning
and
as
strong
a
scenting
wind
as
ever
favored
melton
pink
a
whimper
and
gone
away
soon
echoed
from
beebyside
and
the
pack
not
letting
the
fox
hang
a
second
dashed
after
him
making
straight
for
scraptoft
one
of
the
fastest
things
that
hounds
ever
ran
took
them
straight
through
the
spinnies
past
hamilton
farm
away
beyond
burkby
village
and
down
into
the
valley
of
the
wreake
without
a
check
where
he
broke
away
was
headed
tried
earths
and
was
pulled
down
scarce
forty
minutes
from
the
find
the
pack
then
drew
hungerton
foxhole
blank
drew
carver
spinnies
without
a
whimper
and
lastly
drawing
the
old
familiar
billesden
coplow
had
a
short
quick
burst
with
a
brace
of
cubs
and
returning
settled
themselves
to
a
fine
dog
fox
that
was
raced
an
hunted
slowly
for
fifty
minutes
raced
again
another
sending
all
the
field
to
their
second
horses
and
after
a
clipping
chase
through
the
cream
of
the
grass
country
nearly
saved
his
brush
in
the
twilight
when
the
scent
was
lost
in
a
rushing
hailstorm
but
had
the
little
ladies
laid
on
again
like
wildfire
and
was
killed
with
the
ringing
far
and
away
over
glenn
gorse
after
a
glorious
run
thirty
miles
in
and
out
with
pace
that
tired
the
best
of
them
a
better
day
sport
even
the
quorn
had
never
had
in
all
its
brilliant
annals
and
faster
things
the
melton
men
themselves
had
never
wanted
both
those
who
love
the
quickest
thing
you
ever
knew
thirty
minutes
without
a
check
such
a
pace
and
care
little
whether
the
finale
be
killed
or
broke
away
and
those
of
the
old
fashion
who
prefer
long
day
you
know
steady
as
old
time
the
beauties
stuck
like
wax
through
fourteen
parishes
as
i
live
six
hours
if
it
were
a
minute
horses
positively
walked
you
know
no
end
of
a
day
but
must
have
the
fatal
as
conclusion
both
of
these
the
new
style
and
the
old
could
not
but
be
content
with
the
doings
of
the
demoiselles
from
start
to
finish
was
it
likely
that
cecil
remembered
the
caustic
lash
of
his
ironies
while
he
was
lifting
mother
of
pearl
over
the
posts
and
rails
and
sweeping
on
with
the
halloo
ringing
down
the
wintry
wind
as
the
grasslands
flew
beneath
him
was
it
likely
that
he
recollected
the
difficulties
that
hung
above
him
while
he
was
dashing
down
the
gorse
happy
as
a
king
with
the
wild
hail
driving
in
his
face
and
a
break
of
stormy
sunshine
just
welcoming
the
gallant
few
who
were
landed
at
the
death
as
twilight
fell
was
it
likely
that
he
could
unlearn
all
the
lessons
of
his
life
and
realize
in
how
near
a
neighborhood
he
stood
to
ruin
when
he
was
drinking
regency
sherry
out
of
his
gold
flask
as
he
crossed
the
saddle
of
his
second
horse
or
smoking
rode
slowly
homeward
chatting
with
the
seraph
through
the
leafless
muddy
lanes
in
the
gloaming
scarcely
it
is
very
easy
to
remember
our
difficulties
when
we
are
eating
and
drinking
them
so
to
speak
in
bad
soups
and
worse
wines
in
continental
impecuniosity
sleeping
on
them
as
rough
australian
or
wearing
them
perpetually
in
californian
rags
and
tatters
it
were
impossible
very
well
to
escape
from
them
then
but
it
is
very
hard
to
remember
them
when
every
touch
and
shape
of
life
is
pleasant
to
us
when
everything
about
us
is
symbolical
and
redolent
of
wealth
and
ease
when
the
art
of
enjoyment
is
the
only
one
we
are
called
on
to
study
and
the
science
of
pleasure
all
we
are
asked
to
explore
it
is
impossible
to
believe
yourself
a
beggar
while
you
never
want
sovereigns
for
whist
and
it
would
be
beyond
the
powers
of
human
nature
to
conceive
your
ruin
irrevocable
while
you
still
eat
turbot
and
terrapin
with
a
powdered
giant
behind
your
chair
daily
up
in
his
garret
a
poor
wretch
knows
very
well
what
he
is
and
realizes
in
stern
fact
the
extremities
of
the
last
sou
the
last
shirt
and
the
last
hope
but
in
these
pleasures
in
this
pleasant
reckless
rush
in
this
with
every
luxury
that
the
heart
of
man
can
devise
and
desire
yours
to
command
at
your
will
it
is
hard
work
then
to
grasp
the
truth
that
the
crossing
sweeper
yonder
in
the
dust
of
pall
mall
is
really
not
more
utterly
in
the
toils
of
poverty
than
you
are
beauty
was
never
in
the
whole
course
of
his
days
virtually
or
physically
or
even
metaphorically
reminded
that
he
was
not
a
millionaire
much
less
still
was
he
ever
reminded
so
painfully
life
petted
him
pampered
him
caressed
him
gifted
him
though
of
half
his
gifts
he
never
made
use
lodged
him
like
a
prince
dined
him
like
a
king
and
never
recalled
to
him
by
a
single
privation
or
a
single
sensation
that
he
was
not
as
rich
a
man
as
his
the
seraph
future
duke
of
lyonnesse
how
could
he
then
bring
himself
to
understand
as
nothing
less
than
truth
the
grim
and
cruel
insult
his
father
had
flung
at
him
in
that
brutally
bitter
phrase
a
pauper
and
a
guardsman
if
he
had
ever
been
near
a
comprehension
of
it
which
he
never
was
he
must
have
ceased
to
realize
it
when
pressed
to
dine
with
lord
guenevere
near
whose
house
the
last
fox
had
been
killed
while
a
groom
dashed
over
to
royallieu
for
his
change
of
clothes
he
caught
a
glimpse
as
they
passed
through
the
hall
of
the
ladies
taking
their
preprandial
cups
of
tea
in
the
library
an
enchanting
group
of
lace
and
silks
of
delicate
hue
and
scented
hair
of
blond
cheeks
and
brunette
tresses
of
dark
velvets
and
gossamer
tissue
and
when
he
had
changed
the
scarlet
for
went
down
among
them
to
be
the
darling
of
that
charmed
circle
to
be
smiled
on
and
coquetted
with
by
those
soft
languid
aristocrats
to
be
challenged
by
the
lustrous
eyes
of
his
chatelaine
and
chere
amie
to
be
spoiled
as
women
will
spoil
the
privileged
pet
of
their
drawing
rooms
whom
they
had
made
free
of
the
guild
and
endowed
with
a
flirting
commission
and
acquitted
of
anything
he
was
the
recognized
darling
and
permitted
property
of
the
young
married
beauties
the
unwedded
knew
he
was
hopeless
for
them
and
tacitly
left
him
to
the
more
attractive
conquerors
who
hardly
prized
the
seraph
so
much
as
they
did
bertie
to
sit
in
their
barouches
and
opera
boxes
ride
and
drive
and
yacht
with
them
conduct
a
boccaccio
intrigue
through
the
height
of
the
season
and
make
them
really
believe
themselves
actually
in
love
while
they
were
at
the
moors
or
down
the
nile
and
would
have
given
their
diamonds
to
get
a
new
distraction
lady
guenevere
was
the
last
of
these
his
titled
and
wedded
captors
and
perhaps
the
most
resistless
of
all
of
them
neither
of
them
believed
very
much
in
their
attachment
but
both
of
them
wore
the
masquerade
dress
to
perfection
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
as
much
as
he
ever
fell
in
love
which
was
just
sufficient
to
amuse
him
and
never
enough
to
disturb
him
he
let
himself
be
fascinated
not
exerting
himself
either
to
resist
or
advance
the
affair
till
he
was
perhaps
a
little
more
entangled
with
her
than
it
was
according
to
his
canons
expedient
to
be
and
they
had
the
most
enchanting
friendship
nobody
was
ever
so
indiscreet
as
to
call
it
anything
else
and
my
lord
was
too
deeply
absorbed
in
the
alderney
beauties
that
stood
in
the
yellow
straw
of
his
farmyard
and
the
triumphant
conquests
that
he
gained
over
his
brother
peers
shorthorns
and
suffolks
to
trouble
his
head
about
cecil
attendance
on
his
beautiful
countess
they
corresponded
in
spanish
they
had
a
thousand
charming
ciphers
they
made
the
columns
of
the
times
and
the
post
play
the
unconscious
role
of
medium
to
appointments
they
eclipsed
all
the
pages
of
calderon
or
congreve
comedies
in
the
ingenuities
with
which
they
met
wrote
got
invitations
together
to
the
same
houses
and
arranged
signals
for
mute
communication
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
occasion
for
it
all
it
passed
the
time
however
and
went
far
to
persuade
them
that
they
really
were
in
love
and
had
a
mountain
of
difficulties
and
dangers
to
contend
with
it
added
the
spice
to
the
sauce
and
gave
them
the
relish
of
being
besides
an
open
scandal
would
have
been
very
shocking
to
her
brilliant
ladyship
and
there
was
nothing
on
earth
perhaps
of
which
he
would
have
had
a
more
lively
dread
than
a
scene
but
his
present
friendship
was
delightful
and
presented
no
such
dangers
while
his
fair
friend
was
one
of
the
greatest
beauties
and
the
greatest
coquettes
of
her
time
her
smile
was
honor
her
fan
was
a
scepter
her
face
was
perfect
and
her
heart
never
troubled
herself
or
her
lovers
if
she
had
a
fault
she
was
a
trifle
exacting
but
that
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
in
one
so
omnipotent
and
her
chains
after
all
were
made
of
roses
as
she
sat
in
the
deep
ruddy
glow
of
the
library
fire
with
the
light
flickering
on
her
white
brow
and
her
violet
velvets
as
she
floated
to
the
head
of
her
table
with
opals
shining
among
her
priceless
point
laces
and
some
tropical
flower
with
leaves
of
glistening
gold
crowning
her
bronze
hair
as
she
glided
down
in
a
waltz
along
the
polished
floor
or
bent
her
proud
head
over
ecarte
in
a
musing
grace
that
made
her
opponent
utterly
forget
to
mark
the
king
or
even
play
his
cards
at
all
as
she
talked
in
the
low
music
of
her
voice
of
european
imbrogli
and
consols
and
coupons
for
she
was
a
politician
and
a
speculator
or
lapsed
into
a
beautifully
tinted
study
of
la
femme
incomprise
when
time
and
scene
suited
when
the
stars
were
very
clear
above
the
terraces
without
and
the
conservatory
very
solitary
and
a
touch
of
musset
or
owen
meredith
chimed
in
well
with
the
light
and
shade
of
the
oleanders
and
the
brown
luster
of
her
own
eloquent
glance
in
all
these
how
superb
she
was
and
if
in
truth
her
bosom
only
fell
with
the
falling
of
shares
and
rose
with
the
rising
of
bonds
if
her
soft
shadows
were
only
taken
up
like
the
purple
tinting
under
her
lashes
to
embellish
her
beauty
if
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
thought
musset
a
fool
and
wondered
why
lucille
was
not
written
in
prose
in
her
soul
far
preferring
le
follet
why
it
did
not
matter
that
i
can
see
all
great
ladies
gamble
in
stocks
nowadays
under
the
rose
and
women
are
for
the
most
part
as
cold
clear
hard
and
practical
as
their
adorers
believe
them
the
contrary
and
a
femme
incomprise
is
so
charming
when
she
avows
herself
comprehended
by
you
that
you
would
never
risk
spoiling
the
confidence
by
hinting
a
doubt
of
its
truth
if
she
and
bertie
only
played
at
love
if
neither
believed
much
in
the
other
if
each
trifled
with
a
pretty
gossamer
soufflet
of
passion
much
as
they
trifled
with
the
soufflets
at
dinner
if
both
tried
it
to
trifle
away
ennui
much
as
they
tried
staking
a
friedrich
at
baden
this
light
surface
fashionable
philosophic
form
of
a
passion
they
both
laughed
at
in
its
hot
and
serious
follies
suited
them
admirably
had
it
ever
mingled
a
grain
of
bitterness
in
her
ladyship
souchong
before
dinner
or
given
an
aroma
of
bitterness
to
her
lover
naples
punch
in
the
smoking
room
it
would
have
been
out
of
all
keeping
with
themselves
and
their
world
nothing
on
earth
is
so
pleasant
as
being
a
little
in
love
nothing
on
earth
so
destructive
as
being
too
much
so
and
as
cecil
in
the
idle
enjoyment
of
the
former
gentle
luxury
flirted
with
his
liege
lady
that
night
lying
back
in
the
softest
of
with
his
dark
dreamy
handsome
eyes
looking
all
the
eloquence
in
the
world
and
his
head
drooped
till
his
mustaches
were
almost
touching
her
laces
his
queen
of
beauty
listened
with
charmed
interest
and
to
look
at
him
he
might
have
been
praying
after
the
poet
how
is
it
under
our
control
to
love
or
not
to
love
in
real
truth
he
was
gently
murmuring
such
a
pity
that
you
missed
hounds
found
directly
three
of
the
fastest
things
i
ever
knew
one
after
another
you
should
have
seen
the
ladies
head
him
just
above
the
gorse
three
hares
crossed
us
and
a
fresh
fox
some
of
the
pack
broke
away
after
the
new
scent
but
old
bluebell
your
pet
held
on
like
death
and
most
of
them
kept
after
her
you
had
your
doubts
about
silver
trumpet
shoulders
they
not
the
thing
perhaps
but
she
ran
beautifully
all
day
and
did
show
a
symptom
of
cecil
could
when
needed
do
the
musset
and
meredith
style
of
thing
to
perfection
but
on
the
whole
he
preferred
love
a
la
mode
it
is
so
much
easier
and
less
exhausting
to
tell
your
mistress
of
a
ringing
run
or
a
close
finish
than
to
turn
perpetual
periods
on
the
luster
of
her
eyes
and
the
eternity
of
your
devotion
nor
did
it
at
all
interfere
with
the
sincerity
of
his
worship
that
the
was
at
the
prettiest
little
box
in
the
world
in
the
neighborhood
of
market
harborough
which
he
had
taken
for
her
and
had
been
at
the
meet
that
day
in
her
little
toy
trap
with
its
pair
of
snowy
ponies
and
its
bright
blue
liveries
that
drove
so
desperately
through
his
finances
and
had
ridden
his
hunter
maraschino
with
immense
dash
and
spirit
for
a
young
lady
who
had
never
done
anything
but
pirouette
till
the
last
six
months
and
a
total
and
headlong
disregard
of
purlers
very
reckless
in
a
illiterate
avaricious
little
beauty
whose
face
was
her
fortune
and
who
most
assuredly
would
have
been
adored
no
single
moment
longer
had
she
scarred
her
fair
tinted
cheek
with
the
blackthorn
or
started
as
a
heroine
with
a
broken
nose
like
fielding
cherished
amelia
the
might
rage
might
sulk
might
even
swear
all
sorts
of
naughty
mabille
oaths
most
villainously
pronounced
at
the
ascendancy
of
her
haughty
unapproachable
patrician
rival
she
did
do
all
these
things
but
bertie
would
not
have
been
the
consummate
tactician
the
perfect
flirt
the
skilled
and
steeled
campaigner
in
the
boudoirs
that
he
was
if
he
had
not
been
equal
to
the
delicate
task
of
managing
both
the
peeress
and
the
with
inimitable
ability
even
when
they
placed
him
in
the
seemingly
difficult
dilemma
of
meeting
them
both
with
twenty
yards
between
them
on
the
neutral
ground
of
the
gathering
to
see
the
pytchley
or
the
tailby
throw
off
a
task
he
had
achieved
with
victorious
brilliance
more
than
once
already
this

with

as
that
celebrity
without

swollen
from

after

why

rake
gazed
with
worship
at
the
symmetrical
limbs
of
the
champion
of

first
life
and
plunged
into
speculation
on
the
democratic
tendencies
of

age
as
clearly
contradicted
by
all

and

away
throughout

rendered

melancholy
by

out
of

get
into

off
on

errand
of
his
master
to
the
at
her
tiny
where
the
ponies
made
her
stud
and
where
she
gave
enchanting
little
at
which
she
sang
equally
enchanting
little
and
arrayed
herself
in
the
fontainebleau
hunting
costume
knife
and
all
and
spent
cecil
winnings
for
him
with
a
rapidity
that
threatened
to
leave
very
few
of
them
for
the
london
season
she
was
very
pretty
sweetly
pretty
with
hair
that
wanted
no
gold
powder
the
clearest
sauciest
eyes
and
the
handsomest
mouth
in
the
world
but
of
grammar
she
had
not
a
notion
of
her
aspirates
she
had
never
a
recollection
of
conversation
she
had
not
an
idea
of
slang
she
had
to
be
sure
a
repertoire
but
to
this
was
her
command
of
language
limited
she
dressed
perfectly
but
she
was
a
vulgar
little

everything
from
bass
ale
to

from
to

it
the
height
of

the
climax
of

thoroughly

thoroughly

then
never
had

had
a

was

as
a

to
her
phraseology
so
long
as

could

the
was
perfectly
happy
and
as
for
the
pathetic
pictures
that
novelists
and
moralists
draw
of
vice
sighing
amid
turtle
and
truffles
for
childish
innocence
in
the
cottage
at
home
where
honeysuckles
blossomed
and
brown
brooks
made
melody
and
passionately
grieving
on
the
purple
cushions
of
a
barouche
for
the
time
of
straw
pallets
and
untroubled
sleep
why
the
would
have
vaulted
herself
on
the
of
a
drag
and
told
you
to
stow
all
that
trash
her
childish
recollections
were
of
a
stifling
with
the
odor
of
pigsty
and
pork
for
a
feast
once
a
week
starvation
all
the
other
six
days
kicks
slaps
wrangling
and
a
general
atmosphere
of
beer
and
she
hated
her
past
and
loved
her
cigar
on
the
drag
the
is
fact
the
moralists
pictures
are
moonshine
the
is
an
openly
acknowledged
fact
moreover
daily
becoming
more
prominent
in
the
world
more
brilliant
more
frankly
recognized
and
more
omnipotent
whether
this
will
ultimately
prove
for
the
better
or
the
worse
it
would
be
a
bold
man
who
should
dare
say
there
is
at
least
one
thing
left
to
desire
in
it
that
the
synonym
of
aspasia
which
serves
so
often
to
designate
in
journalistic
literature
these
free
lances
of
life
were
more
suitable
in
artistic
and
intellectual
similarity
and
that
when
the
and
her
sisterhood
plunge
their
white
arms
into
so
many
fortunes
and
rule
the
world
right
and
left
as
they
do
they
could
also
sound
their
h
properly
and
knew
a
little
orthography
if
they
could
not
be
changed
into
such
queens
of
grace
of
intellect
of
sovereign
mind
and
splendid
wit
as
were
their
prototypes
when
she
whose
name
they
debase
held
her
rule
in
the
city
of
the
violet
crown
and
gathered
about
her
phidias
the
divine
haughty
and
eloquent
antipho
the
gay
crates
the
subtle
protagorus
cratinus
so
acrid
and
yet
so
jovial
damon
of
the
silver
lyre
and
the
great
poets
who
are
poets
for
all
time
author
and
artist
noble
and
soldier
court
the
order
now
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
hellenic
idols
were
of
a
more
exalted
type
than
are
the
hyde
park
goddesses
however
the
was
the
rage
and
spent
bertie
money
when
he
got
any
just
as
her
willful
sovereignty
fancied
and
rake
rode
on
now
with
his
master
note
bearing
no
very
good
will
to
her
for
rake
had
very
strong
prejudices
and
none
stronger
than
against
these
fair
pillagers
who
went
about
seeking
whom
they
should
devour
and
laughing
at
the
wholesale
ruin
they
wrought
while
the
sentimentalists
babbled
in
social
science
of
pearls
lost
and
innocence
a
girl
that
used
to
eat
tripe
and
red
herring
in
a
pack
and
dance
for
a
shilling
a
night
in
gauze
coming
it
so
grand
that
only
eat
asparagus
in
march
and
drink
the
best
brands
with
her
truffles
why
she
ai
worth
sixpence
thrown
away
on
her
unless
worth
while
to
hear
how
hard
she
can
swear
at
you
averred
rake
in
his
eloquence
and
he
was
undoubtedly
right
for
that
matter
but
then
the
was
the
rage
and
if
ever
she
should
be
sold
up
great
ladies
would
crowd
to
her
sale
and
buy
with
eager
curiosity
at
high
prices
her
most
trumpery
pots
of
pomatum
her
most
flimsy
of
marqueterie
rake
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
men
and
manners
and
in
his
own
opinion
at
least
was
up
to
every
dodge
on
the
cross
that
this
iniquitous
world
could
unfold
a
bright
lithe
animated
vigorous
and
sturdy
fellow
seemingly
with
a
dash
of
the
celt
in
him
that
made
him
vivacious
and
peppery
rake
polished
his
wits
quite
as
much
as
he
polished
the
tops
and
considered
himself
a
philosopher
of
whose
son
he
was
he
had
not
the
remotest
idea
his
earliest
recollections
were
of
the
tender
mercies
of
the
workhouse
but
even
that
chill
the
parish
had
not
damaged
the
liveliness
of
his
temper
or
the
independence
of
his
opinions
and
as
soon
as
he
was
fifteen
rake
had
run
away
and
joined
a
circus
distinguishing
himself
there
by
his
genius
for
standing
on
his
head
and
tying
his
limbs
into
a
porter
knot
from
the
circus
he
migrated
successively
into
the
shape
of
a
comic
singer
a
tapster
a
navvy
a
a
guacho
in
mexico
working
his
passage
out
a
fireman
in
new
york
a
ventriloquist
in
maryland
a
vaquero
in
spanish
california
a
lemonade
seller
in
san
francisco
a
revolutionist
in
the
argentine
without
the
most
distant
idea
what
he
fought
for
a
boatman
on
the
bay
of
mapiri
a
blacksmith
in
santarem
a
trapper
in
the
wilderness
and
finally
working
his
passage
home
again
took
the
queen
shilling
in
dublin
and
was
drafted
into
a
regiment
with
the
th
he
served
half
a
dozen
years
in
india
a
a
splendid
fellow
in
a
charge
or
a
pursuit
with
an
astonishing
power
over
horses
and
the
clearest
sweep
of
a
saber
that
ever
cut
down
a
knot
of
natives
but
insubordinate
do
his
duty
whenever
fighting
was
in
question
he
did
most
zealously
but
to
kick
over
the
traces
at
other
times
was
a
temptation
that
at
last
became
too
strong
for
that
lawless
lover
of
liberty
from
the
moment
that
he
joined
the
regiment
a
certain
corporal
warne
and
he
had
conceived
an
antipathy
to
one
another
which
rake
had
to
control
as
he
might
and
which
the
corporal
was
not
above
indulging
in
every
petty
piece
of
tyranny
that
his
rank
allowed
him
to
exercise
on
active
service
rake
was
by
instinct
too
good
a
soldier
not
to
manage
to
keep
the
curb
on
himself
tolerably
well
though
he
was
always
regarded
in
his
troop
rather
as
a
hound
that
will
riot
is
regarded
in
the
pack
but
when
the
th
came
back
to
brighton
and
to
barracks
the
evil
spirit
of
rebellion
began
to
get
a
little
hotter
in
him
under
th
corporal
idees
napoliennes
of
justifiable
persecution
warne
indisputably
provoked
his
man
in
a
cold
iron
strictly
lawful
sort
of
manner
moreover
all
the
more
irritating
to
a
temper
like
rake
hanged
if
i
care
how
the
officers
come
it
over
me
they
gentlemen
and
it
do
try
a
fellow
would
rake
say
in
confidential
moments
over
purl
and
a
of
his
experience
in
the
argentine
republic
having
left
him
with
strongly
aristocratic
prejudices
but
when
it
comes
to
a
duffer
like
that
that
knows
no
better
than
me
what
ai
a
bit
better
than
me
and
what
is
as
clumsy
a
duffer
about
a
horse
plates
as
ever
i
knew
and
would
almost
let
a
young
buck
him
out
of
his
saddle
why
then
i
do
cut
up
rough
i
ai
denying
it
and
i
do
see
what
there
is
in
his
stripes
to
give
him
such
a
license
to
be
with
which
rake
would
blow
the
froth
off
his
pewter
with
a
puff
of
concentrated
wrath
and
an
oath
against
his
officers
that
might
have
let
some
light
in
upon
the
advocates
for
promotion
from
the
ranks
had
they
been
there
to
take
the
lesson
at
last
in
the
leisure
of
brighton
the
storm
broke
rake
had
a
scotch
hound
that
was
the
pride
of
his
life
his
often
going
instead
to
buy
dainties
for
the
dog
who
became
one
of
the
channels
through
which
warne
could
annoy
and
thwart
him
the
dog
did
no
harm
being
a
fine
deerhound
but
it
pleased
the
corporal
to
consider
that
it
did
simply
because
it
belonged
to
rake
whose
popularity
in
the
corps
owing
to
his
good
nature
his
good
spirits
and
his
innumerable
tales
of
american
experience
and
amorous
adventures
increased
the
jealous
dislike
which
his
knack
with
an
unbroken
colt
and
his
abundant
stable
science
had
first
raised
in
his
superior
one
day
in
the
chargers
stables
the
hound
ran
out
of
a
loose
box
with
a
rush
to
get
at
rake
and
upset
a
pailful
of
warm
mash
the
corporal
who
was
standing
by
in
harness
hit
him
over
the
head
with
a
heavy
whip
he
had
in
his
hand
infuriated
by
the
pain
the
dog
flew
at
him
tearing
his
overalls
with
a
fierce
crunch
of
his
teeth
take
the
brute
off
and
string
him
up
with
a
halter
i
put
up
with
him
too
long
cried
warne
to
a
couple
of
privates
working
near
in
their
stable
dress
before
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
rake
threw
himself
on
him
with
a
bound
like
lightning
and
wrenching
the
whip
out
of
his
hands
struck
him
a
slashing
stinging
blow
across
his
face
hang
my
hound
you
cur
if
you
touch
a
hair
of
him
i
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
and
assuredly
he
would
have
kept
his
word
had
he
not
been
made
a
prisoner
and
marched
off
to
the
guardroom
rake
learned
the
stern
necessity
of
the
law
which
for
the
sake
of
morale
must
make
the
soldiers
whose
blood
is
wanted
to
be
like
fire
on
the
field
patient
pulseless
and
enduring
of
every
provocation
cruelty
and
insolence
in
the
camp
and
barrack
as
though
they
were
statues
of
stone
a
needful
law
a
wise
law
an
indispensable
law
doubtless
but
a
very
hard
law
to
be
obeyed
by
a
man
full
of
life
and
all
life
passions
at
the
on
his
mutinous
conduct
which
followed
many
witnesses
brought
evidence
on
being
pressed
to
the
unpopularity
of
warne
in
the
regiment
and
to
his
harshness
and
his
tyranny
to
rake
many
men
spoke
out
what
had
been
chained
down
in
their
thoughts
for
years
and
in
consideration
of
the
provocation
received
the
prisoner
who
was
much
liked
by
the
officers
was
condemned
to
six
months
imprisonment
for
his
insubordination
and
blow
to
his
superior
officer
without
being
tied
up
to
the
triangles
at
the
cecil
who
chanced
to
be
in
brighton
after
goodwood
was
present
one
day
with
some
other
guardsmen
and
the
look
of
rake
with
his
cheerfulness
under
difficulties
his
love
for
the
hound
and
his
bright
sunburnt
shrewd
humorous
countenance
took
his
fancy
beauty
was
the
essence
of
good
nature
indolent
himself
he
hated
to
see
anything
or
anybody
worried
lazy
gentle
wayward
and
spoilt
by
his
own
world
he
was
still
never
so
selfish
and
philosophic
as
he
pretended
but
what
he
would
do
a
kindness
if
one
came
in
his
way
it
is
not
a
very
great
virtue
perhaps
but
it
is
a
rare
one
poor
devil
struck
the
other
because
he
would
have
his
dog
hanged
well
on
my
word
i
should
have
done
the
same
in
his
place
if
i
could
have
got
up
the
pace
for
so
much
exertion
murmured
cecil
to
his
cheroot
careless
of
the
demoralizing
tendency
of
his
remarks
for
the
army
in
general
had
it
occurred
in
the
guards
and
he
had
sat
on
the
case
rake
would
have
had
one
very
lenient
judge
as
it
was
bertie
actually
went
the
lengths
of
thinking
seriously
about
the
matter
he
liked
rake
devotion
to
his
dumb
friend
and
he
heard
of
his
intense
popularity
in
his
troop
he
wished
to
save
if
he
could
so
fine
a
fellow
from
the
risks
of
his
turbulent
passion
and
from
the
stern
fetters
of
a
trying
discipline
hence
when
rake
found
himself
condemned
to
his
cell
he
had
a
message
sent
him
by
bertie
groom
that
when
his
term
of
punishment
should
be
over
cecil
would
buy
his
discharge
from
the
service
and
engage
him
as
extra
having
had
a
good
account
of
his
capabilities
he
had
taken
the
hound
to
his
own
kennels
now
the
fellow
had
been
thoroughly
throughout
the
whole
course
of
the
proceedings
had
heard
his
sentence
with
sublime
impudence
and
had
chaffed
his
sentinels
with
an
utterly
reckless
nonchalance
but
somehow
or
other
when
that
message
reached
him
a
vivid
sense
that
he
was
a
condemned
and
disgraced
man
suddenly
flooded
in
on
him
a
passionate
gratitude
seized
him
to
the
young
aristocrat
who
had
thought
of
him
in
his
destitution
and
condemnation
who
had
even
thought
of
his
dog
and
rake
the
philosophic
and
undauntable
could
have
found
it
in
his
heart
to
kneel
down
in
the
dust
and
kiss
the
when
he
held
it
for
his
new
master
so
strong
was
the
loyalty
he
bore
from
that
moment
to
bertie
martinets
were
scandalized
at
a
taking
as
his
private
valet
a
man
who
had
been
guilty
of
such
conduct
in
the
light
cavalry
but
cecil
never
troubled
his
head
about
what
people
said
and
so
invaluable
did
rake
speedily
become
to
him
that
he
had
kept
him
about
his
person
wherever
he
went
from
then
until
now
two
years
after
rake
loved
his
master
with
a
fidelity
very
rare
in
these
days
he
loved
his
horses
his
dogs
everything
that
was
his
down
to
his
very
rifle
and
boots
slaved
for
him
cheerfully
and
was
as
proud
of
the
deer
he
stalked
of
the
brace
he
bagged
of
his
winnings
when
the
household
played
the
zingari
or
his
victory
when
his
yacht
won
the
cherbourg
cup
as
though
those
successes
had
been
rake
own
my
dear
seraph
said
cecil
himself
once
on
this
point
to
the
marquis
if
you
want
generosity
fidelity
and
all
the
rest
of
the
cardinal
d
sins
ai
it
go
to
a
scamp
he
stick
to
you
till
he
kills
himself
if
you
want
to
be
cheated
get
a
respectable
immaculate
he
swindle
you
piously
and
decamp
with
your
doncaster
and
rake
who
assuredly
had
been
an
scamp
made
good
bertie
creed
he
stuck
to
him
devoutly
and
no
terrier
was
ever
more
alive
to
an
otter
than
he
was
to
the
guardsman
interests
it
was
that
very
vigilance
which
made
him
as
he
rode
back
from
the
in
the
twilight
notice
what
would
have
escaped
any
save
one
who
had
been
practiced
as
a
trapper
in
the
red
canadian
woods
namely
the
head
of
a
man
almost
hidden
among
the
heavy
though
leafless
brushwood
and
the
yellow
gorse
of
a
spinney
which
lay
on
his
left
in
royallieu
park
rake
eyes
were
telescopic
and
microscopic
moreover
they
had
been
trained
to
know
such
little
signs
as
a
marsh
from
a
hen
harrier
in
full
flight
by
the
length
of
wing
and
tail
and
a
widgeon
or
a
coot
from
a
mallard
or
a
teal
by
the
depth
each
swam
out
of
the
water
gray
and
foggy
as
it
was
and
high
as
was
the
gorse
rake
recognized
his
willon
what
he
up
to
there
thought
rake
surveying
the
place
which
was
wild
solitary
and
an
unlikely
place
enough
for
a
head
groom
to
be
found
in
if
he
ai
a
rascal
i
never
seen
one
it
my
belief
he
cheats
the
stable
thick
and
thin
and
gets
on
cecil
mounts
to
a
good
tune
aye
and
would
nobble
as
soon
as
not
if
it
just
suited
his
book
that
blessed
king
hates
the
man
how
he
lashes
his
heels
at
him
it
was
certainly
possible
that
willon
might
be
passing
an
idle
hour
in
potting
rabbits
or
be
otherwise
innocently
engaged
enough
but
the
sight
of
him
there
among
the
gorse
was
a
sight
of
suspicion
to
rake
instantaneous
thoughts
darted
through
his

the

his

to

overruling

with
a
gallop
that
was
muffled
on

he
dashed
straight
at
the
covert

he
was
within
ten
paces

and
looked
up
hastily
he
was
talking
to
a
man
very
quietly
dressed
in
shepherd
plaid
chiefly
remarkable
by
a
beard
and
whiskers
the
groom
turned
pale
and
laughed
nervously

took

asked

with

the

to

you

sighed
the
victim
raising
himself
with
reluctance
while
the
seraph
disappeared
in
a
cloud
of
turkish
neither
bertie
indolence
nor
his
insouciance
was
assumed
utter
carelessness
was
his
nature
utter
impassability
was
his
habit
and
he
was
truly
for
the
moment
loath
to
leave
his
bed
his
coffee
and
his
novel
he
must
have
his
leg
over
the
saddle
and
feel
the
strain
on
his
arms
of
that
pulling
pace
with
which
the
king
always
went
when
once
he
settled
into
his
stride
before
he
would
really
think
about
winning
the
hunting
breakfasts
of
our
forefathers
and
of
our
present
squires
found
no
favor
with
bertie
a
slice
of
game
and
a
glass
of
curacoa
were
all
he
kept
the
drag
waiting
to
swallow
and
the
four
bays
going
at
a
pelting
pace
he
and
the
rest
of
the
household
who
were
gathered
at
royallieu
were
by
good
luck
in
time
for
the
of
the
quorn
where
the
hero
o
the
blue
ribbon
was
dancing
impatiently
under
hand
scenting
the
fresh
keen
sunny
air
and
knowing
as
well
what
all
those
bits
of
scarlet
straying
in
through
field
and
lane
gate
and
gap
meant
as
well
as
though
the
merry
notes
of
the
master
horn
were
winding
over
the
gorse
the
meet
was
brilliant
and
very
large
showing
such
a
gathering
as
only
the
melton
country
can
and
foremost
among
the
crowd
of
carriages
hacks
and
hunters
were
the
beautiful
roan
mare
vivandiere
of
the
lady
guenevere
mounted
by
that
exquisite
peeress
in
her
violet
habit
and
her
tiny
velvet
hat
and
the
pony
equipage
of
the
all
glittering
with
azure
and
silver
leopard
rugs
and
snowy
reins
the
breadth
of
half
an
acre
of
grassland
was
between
them
but
the
groups
of
men
about
them
were
tolerably
equal
for
number
and
for
rank
take
off
my
hands
for
this
morning
seraph
there
a
good
fellow
murmured
cecil
as
he
swung
himself
into
saddle
the
seraph
gave
a
leonine
growl
sighed
and
acquiesced
he
detested
women
in
the
but
that
sweetest
tempered
giant
of
the
brigades
never
refused
anything
to
anybody
much
less
to
to
an
uninitiated
mind
it
would
have
seemed
marvelous
and
beautiful
in
its
combination
of
simplicity
and
intricacy
to
have
noted
the
delicate
tactics
with
which
bertie
conducted
himself
between
his
two
claimants
bending
to
his
countess
with
a
reverent
devotion
that
assuaged
whatever
of
incensed
perception
of
her
unacknowledged
rival
might
be
silently
lurking
in
her
proud
heart
wheeling
up
to
the
under
cover
of
speaking
to
the
men
from
egerton
lodge
and
restoring
the

sulkiness
by
a
propitiatory
offer
of
a
little
gold
studded
with
turquoises
just
ordered
for
her
from
regent
street
which
however
she
ungraciously
contemned
because
she
thought
it
had
only
cost
twenty
guineas
anchoring
the
victimized
seraph
beside
her
by
an
adroit
ah
by
the

rock
give
one
of
your
papelitos
she
been
wild
to
smoke
them
and
leaving
the
content
at
securing
a
future
duke
was
free
to
canter
back
and
flirt
on
the
offside
of
vivandiere
till
the
signal
the
cast
made
with
consummate
craft
the
waving
of
the
white
sterns
among
the
brushwood
the
tightening
of
girths
the
throwing
away
of
cigars
the
challenge
the
whimper
and
the
stole
away
sent
the
field
headlong
down
the
course
after
as
fine
a
greyhound
fox
as
ever
carried
a
brush
away
he
went
in
a
rattling
spin
breaking
straight
at
once
for
the
open
the
hounds
on
the
scent
like
mad
with
a
that
thundered
through
the
cloudless
crisp
cold
glittering
noon
the
field
dashed
off
the
violet
habit
of
her
ladyship
and
the
azure
skirts
of
the
foremost
of
all
in
the
rush
through
the
spinneys
while
cecil
on
the
king
and
the
seraph
on
a
magnificent
white
as
thoroughbred
and
colossal
as
himself
led
the
way
with
them
the
scent
was
hot
as
death
in
the
spinneys
and
the
pack
raced
till
nothing
but
a
good
one
could
live
with
them
few
but
good
ones
however
were
to
be
found
with
the
quorn
and
the
field
held
together
superbly
over
the
first
fence
and
on
across
the
grassland
the
game
old
fox
giving
no
sign
of
going
to
covert
but
running
straight
as
a
crow
flies
while
the
pace
grew
terrific
beats
cried
the
while
her
blue
skirts
fluttered
in
the
wind
as
she
lifted
cecil
brown
mare
very
cleverly
over
a
bilberry
hedge
and
set
her
little
white
teeth
with
a
will
on
the
seraph
cigarette
lady
guenevere
heard
the
words
as
vivandiere
rose
in
the
air
with
the
light
bound
of
a
roe
and
a
slight
superb
dash
of
scorn
came
into
her
haughty
eyes
for
the
moment
she
never
seemed
to
know
that
that
person
in
the
azure
habit
even
existed
but
the
contempt
awoke
in
her
and
shone
in
her
glance
while
she
rode
on
as
that
fair
leader
of
the
belvoir
and
pytchley
alone
could
ride
over
the
fallows
the
steam
was
on
at
full
pressure
the
hounds
held
close
to
his
brush
heads
up
sterns
down
running
still
straight
as
an
arrow
over
the
open
past
coppice
and
covert
through
gorse
and
spinney
without
a
sign
of
the
fox
making
for
shelter
fence
and
double
hedge
and
brook
soon
scattered
the
field
straying
off
far
and
wide
and
coming
to
grief
with
lots
of
downers
it
grew
select
and
few
but
the
crack
men
could
keep
the
hounds
in
view
catch
who
can
was
the
one
mot
for
they
were
literally
racing
the
never
losing
the
scent
a
second
as
the
fox
taking
to
dodging
made
all
the
trouble
he
could
for
them
through
the
rides
of
the
woods
their
working
was
magnificent
and
heading
him
they
ran
him
round
and
round
in
a
ring
viewed
him
for
a
second
and
drove
him
out
of
covert
once
more
into
the
pastures
while
they
laid
on
at
a
hotter
scent
and
flew
after
him
like
staghounds
only
half
a
dozen
were
up
with
them
now
the
pace
was
tremendous
though
all
over
grass
here
a
flight
of
posts
and
rails
tried
the
muscle
of
the
boldest
there
a
bullfinch
yawned
behind
the
blackthorn
here
a
big
fence
towered
there
a
brook
rushed
angrily
among
its
rushes
while
the
keen
easterly
wind
blew
over
the
meadows
and
the
pack
streamed
along
like
the
white
trail
of
a
plume
cecil
showed
the
way
with
the
stride
and
the
fencing
as
had
won
him
the
vase
lady
guenevere
and
the
seraph
were
running
almost
even
with
him
three
of
the
household
farther
down
the
and
some
melton
men
two
meadows
off
the
rest
of
the
field
nowhere
minutes
had
gone
by
in
that
splendid
running
without
a
single
check
while
the
fox
raced
as
gamely
and
as
fast
as
at
the
find
the
speed
was
like
lightning
past
the
brown
woods
the
pine
plantations
the
hedges
bright
with
scarlet
berries
through
the
green
grasslands
and
the
winding
drives
of
coverts
and
the
boles
of
beech
trunks
whose
roots
the
violets
were
just
purpling
with
their
blossom
while
far
away
stretched
the
blue
haze
of
the
distance
and
a
flight
of
rooks
cawed
merrily
in
the
bright
air
soon
left
far
off
as
the
pack
swept
onward
in
the
most
brilliant
thing
of
the
hunting
year
water
take
care
cried
cecil
with
a
warning
wave
of
his
hand
as
the
hounds
with
a
splash
like
a
torrent
dashed
up
to
their
necks
in
a
broad
brawling
brook
that
reynard
had
swam
in
style
and
struggled
as
best
they
could
after
him
it
was
an
awkward
bit
with
bad
and
a
villainous
for
landing
and
the
water
thickened
and
swollen
with
recent
rains
had
made
all
the
land
that
sloped
to
it
miry
and
soft
as
sponge
it
was
the
risk
of
life
and
limb
to
try
it
but
all
who
still
viewed
the
hounds
catching
bertie
shout
of
warning
worked
their
horses
up
for
it
and
charged
toward
it
as
hotly
as
troops
charge
a
square
forest
king
was
over
like
a
bird
the
winner
of
the
grand
military
was
not
to
be
daunted
by
all
the
puny
streams
of
the
shires
the
artistic
riding
of
the
countess
landed
vivandiere
with
a
beautiful
clear
spring
after
him
by
a
couple
of
lengths
the
seraph
handsome
white
hunter
brought
up
at
a
headlong
gallop
with
characteristic
careless
dash
and
fine
science
mingled
cleared
it
but
falling
with
a
mighty
crash
gave
him
a
purler
on
the
opposite
side
and
was
within
an
inch
of
striking
him
dead
with
his
hoof
in
frantic
struggles
to
recover
the
seraph
however
was
on
his
legs
with
a
rapidity
marvelous
in
a
son
of
anak
picked
up
the
horse
threw
himself
into
saddle
and
dashed
off
again
quick
as
lightning
with
his
scarlet
stained
all
over
and
his
long
fair
mustaches
floating
in
the
wind
the
turned
mother
of
pearl
back
with
a
fiery
french
oath
she
hated
to
be
cut
down
but
she
liked
still
less
to
risk
her
neck
and
two
of
the
household
were
already
treated
to
crackers
that
disabled
them
for
the
day
while
one
melton
man
was
pitched
head
foremost
into
the
brook
and
another
was
sitting
dolorously
on
the
bank
with
his
horse
head
in
his
lap
and
the
poor
brute
spine
broken
there
were
only
three
of
the
first
riders
in
england
now
alone
with
the
hounds
who
with
a
cold
scent
as
the
fox
led
them
through
the
angular
corner
of
a
thick
pheasant
covert
stuck
like
wax
to
the
line
and
working
him
out
viewed
him
once
more
for
one
wild
breathless
tantalizing
second
and
through
the
straggling
street
of
a
little
hamlet
and
got
him
out
again
on
the
level
pasture
and
across
a
fine
line
of
hunting
country
with
the
leafless
woods
and
the
low
gates
of
a
park
far
away
to
their
westward
a
guinea
to
a
shilling
that
we
kill
him
cried
the
of
her
brilliant
ladyship
as
she
ran
a
moment
side
by
side
with
forest
king
and
flashed
her
rich
eyes
on
his
rider
she
had
scorned
the
but
on
occasion
she
would
use
betting
slang
and
racing
slang
with
the
daintiest
grace
in
the
world
herself
without
their
polluting
her
lips
as
though
the
old
fox
heard
the
wager
he
swept
in
a
bend
round
toward
the
woods
on
the
right
making
with
all
the
craft
and
speed
there
were
in
him
for
the
deep
shelter
of
the
boxwood
and
laurel
after
him
my
beauties
my
beauties
if
he
run
there
he
go
to
ground
and
save
his
brush
thundered
the
seraph
as
though
he
were
hunting
his
own
hounds
at
lyonnesse
who
knew
every
tone
of
his
rich
clarion
notes
as
well
as
they
knew
every
wind
of
his
horn
but
the
young
ones
of
the
pack
saw
reynard
move
and
his
meaning
as
quickly
as
he
did
having
run
fast
before
they
flew
now
the
pace
was
terrific
two
fences
were
crossed
as
though
they
were
paper
the
meadows
raced
with
lightning
speed
a
leaped
a
gate
cleared
with
a
crashing
jump
and
in
all
the
furious
excitement
of
view
they
tore
down
the
length
of
an
avenue
dashed
into
a
flower
garden
and
smashing
through
a
gay
of
scarlet
creeper
plunged
into
the
and
killed
with
as
loud
a
shout
ringing
over
the
country
in
the
bright
sunny
day
as
ever
was
echoed
by
the
ringing
cheers
of
the
shire
cecil
the
seraph
and
her
victorious
ladyship
alone
coming
in
for
the
glories
of
the
never
had
a
faster
seventy
minutes
said
lady
guenevere
looking
at
the
tiny
jeweled
watch
the
size
of
a
sixpence
that
was
set
in
the
handle
of
her
whip
as
the

with
all
the
compliments
customary
was
handed
to
her

won

unceremoniously
entered
belonged
to
a
baronet
who
though
he
hunted
little
himself
honored
the
sport
and
scorned
a
vulpecide
he
came
out
naturally
and
begged
them
to
lunch
lady
guenevere
refused
to
dismount
but
consented
to
take
a
biscuit
and
a
little
lafitte
while
clarets
liqueurs
and
ales
with
anything
else
they
wanted
were
brought
to
her
companions
the
stragglers
strayed
in
the
came
up
just
too
late
the
men
getting
down
gathered
about
the
countess
or
lounged
on
the
gray
stone
steps
of
the
elizabethan
house
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
the
oriole
casements
the
antique
gables
the
twisted
chimneys
all
covered
with
crimson
parasites
and
trailing
ivy
the
horses
the
scarlet
the
pack
in
the
paddock
adjacent
the
shrubberies
of
laurel
and
araucaria
the
terraces
made
a
bright
and
picturesque
grouping
bertie
with
his
hand
on
vivandiere
pommel
after
taking
a
deep
draught
of
sparkling
rhenish
looked
on
at
it
all
with
a
pleasant
sigh
of
amusement
by
jove
he
murmured
softly
with
a
contented
smile
about
his
lips
that
was
a
ringing
run
at
that
very
moment
as
the
words
were
spoken
a
groom
approached
him
hastily
his
young
brother
whom
he
had
scarcely
seen
since
the
find
had
been
thrown
and
taken
home
on
a
hurdle
the
injuries
were
rumored
to
be
serious
bertie
smile
faded
he
looked
very
grave
as
he
was
reckless
in
everything
and
egotist
though
he
had
long
been
by
profession
he
loved
the
lad
when
he
entered
the
darkened
room
with
its
faint
chloroform
odor
the
boy
lay
like
one
dead
his
bright
hair
scattered
on
the
pillow
his
chest
bare
and
his
right
arm
broken
and
splintered
the
deathlike
coma
was
but
the
result
of
the
chloroform
but
cecil
never
stayed
to
ask
or
remember
that
he
was
by
the
couch
in
a
single
stride
and
dropped
down
by
it
his
head
bent
on
his
arms
it
was
my
fault
i
should
have
looked
to
the
words
were
very
low
he
hated
that
any
should
see
he
could
still
be
such
a
fool
as
to
feel
a
minute
and
he
conquered
himself
he
rose
and
with
his
hand
on
the
boy
fair
tumbled
curls
turned
calmly
to
the
medical
men
who
attached
to
the
household
had
been
on
the
spot
at
once
what
is
the
matter
fractured
arm
contusion
nothing
serious
nothing
at
all
at
his
age
replied
the
surgeon
when
he
wakes
out
of
the
lethargy
he
will
tell
you
so
himself
you
are
certain
do
what
he
would
his
voice
shook
a
little
his
hand
had
not
shaken
two
days
before
when
nothing
less
than
ruin
or
ransom
had
hung
on
his
losing
or
winning
the
race
perfectly
certain
answered
the
surgeon
cheerfully
he
is
not
overstrong
to
be
sure
but
the
contusions
are
slight
he
will
be
out
of
that
bed
in
a
how
did
he
fall
but
while
they
told
him
he
scarcely
heard
he
was
looking
at
the
handsome
form
of
the
lad
as
it
lay
stretched
helpless
and
stricken
before
him
and
he
was
remembering
the
of
their
mother
when
the
only
voice
he
had
ever
reverenced
had
whispered
as
she
pointed
to
the
little
child
of
three
summers
when
you
are
a
man
take
care
of
him
how
had
he
fulfilled
the
injunction
into
how
much
brilliantly
tinted
evil
had
he
not
led
him
by
example
at
least
the
surgeon
touched
his
arm
apologetically
after
a
lengthened
silence
your
brother
will
be
best
unexcited
when
he
comes
to
himself
sir
look
his
eyes
are
unclosing
now
could
you
do
me
the
favor
to
go
to
his
lordship
his
grief
made
him
perfectly
wild
so
dangerous
to
his
life
at
his
age
we
could
only
persuade
him
to
retire
a
few
minutes
ago
on
the
plea
of
berkeley
safety
if
you
could
see
him
cecil
went
mechanically
almost
and
with
a
grave
weary
depression
on
him
he
was
so
unaccustomed
to
think
at
all
so
utterly
unaccustomed
to
think
painfully
that
he
scarcely
knew
what
ailed
him
had
he
had
his
old
tact
about
him
he
would
have
known
how
worse
than
useless
it
would
be
for
him
to
seek
his
father
in
such
a
moment
lord
royallieu
was
lying
back
exhausted
as
cecil
opened
the
door
of
his
private
apartments
heavily
darkened
and
heavily
perfumed
at
the
turn
of
the
lock
he
started
up
eagerly
what
news
of
him
good
news
i
hope
said
cecil
gently
as
he
came
forward
the
injuries
are
not
grave
they
tell
me
i
am
so
sorry
that
i
never
watched
his
fencing
but
the
old
man
had
not
recognized
him
till
he
heard
his
voice
and
he
waved
him
off
with
a
fierce
contemptuous
gesture
the
grief
for
his
favorite
danger
the
wild
terrors
that
his
fears
had
conjured
up
his
almost
frantic
agony
at
the
sight
of
the
accident
had
lashed
him
into
passion
delirious
out
of
my
sight
sir
he
said
fiercely
his
mellow
tones
quivering
with
rage
i
wish
to
god
you
had
been
dead
in
a
ditch
before
a
hair
of
my
boy
had
been
touched
you
live
and
he
lies
dying
there
cecil
bowed
in
silence
the
brutality
of
the
words
wounded
but
they
did
not
offend
him
for
he
knew
his
father
was
in
that
moment
scarce
better
than
a
maniac
and
he
was
touched
with
the
haggard
misery
upon
the
old
peer
face
out
of
my
sight
sir
lord
royallieu
as
he
strode
forward
passion
lending
vigor
to
his
emaciated
frame
while
the
dignity
of
his
grand
carriage
blent
with
the
furious
force
of
his
infuriated
blindness
if
you
had
had
the
heart
of
a
man
you
would
have
saved
such
a
child
as
that
from
his
peril
warned
him
watched
him
succored
him
at
least
when
he
fell
instead
of
that
you
ride
on
and
leave
him
to
die
if
death
comes
to
him
you
are
safe
you
are
always
safe
you
try
to
kill
yourself
with
every
vice
under
heaven
and
only
get
more
strength
more
grace
more
pleasure
from
it
you
are
always
safe
because
i
hate
you
yes
i
hate
you
sir
no
words
can
give
the
force
the
malignity
the
concentrated
meaning
with
which
the
words
were
hurled
out
as
the
majestic
form
of
the
old
lord
towered
in
the
shadow
with
his
hands
outstretched
as
if
in
imprecation
cecil
heard
him
in
silence
doubting
if
he
could
hear
aright
while
the
bitter
phrases
scathed
and
cut
like
scourges
but
he
bowed
once
more
with
the
manner
that
was
as
inseparable
from
him
as
his
nature
hate
is
so
exhausting
i
regret
i
give
you
the
trouble
of
it
may
i
ask
why
you
favor
me
with
it
you
may
thundered
his
father
while
his
hawk
eyes
flashed
their
glittering
fire
you
are
like
the
man
i
cursed
living
and
curse
dead
you
look
at
me
with
alan
bertie
eyes
you
speak
to
me
with
alan
bertie
voice
i
loved
your
mother
i
worshiped
her
but
you
are
his
son
not
mine
the
secret
doubt
treasured
so
long
was
told
at
last
the
blood
flushed
bertie
face
a
deep
and
burning
scarlet
he
started
with
an
irrepressible
tremor
like
a
man
struck
with
a
shot
he
felt
like
one
suddenly
stabbed
in
the
dark
by
a
sure
and
a
cruel
hand
the
insult
and
the
amazement
of
the
words
seemed
to
paralyze
him
for
the
moment
the
next
he
recovered
himself
and
lifted
his
head
with
as
haughty
a
gesture
as
his
father
his
features
perfectly
composed
again
and
sterner
than
in
all
his
careless
easy
life
they
ever
yet
had
looked
you
lie
and
you
know
you
lie
my
mother
was
pure
as
the
angels
henceforth
you
can
be
only
to
me
a
slanderer
who
has
dared
to
taint
the
one
name
holy
in
my
and
without
another
word
he
turned
and
went
out
of
the
chamber
yet
as
the
door
closed
old
habit
was
so
strong
on
him
that
even
in
his
hot
and
bitter
pain
and
his
bewildered
sense
of
sudden
outrage
he
almost
smiled
at
himself
it
is
a
mania
he
does
not
know
what
he
says
he
thought
how
could
i
be
so
melodramatic
we
were
like
two
men
at
the
porte
martin
inflated
language
is
such
bad
form
but
the
cruel
stroke
had
not
struck
the
less
closely
home
and
gentle
though
his
nature
was
beyond
all
forgiveness
from
him
was
the
dishonor
of
his
mother

that
gives
a
more

crown
than

blood

ever
bestow

was

without

no

private
concert
or

without
being
visited
by
him
how
he
in
especial
had
got
his
reputation
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
unless
it
were
that
he
dressed
a
shade
more
perfectly
than
anyone
and
with
such
inimitable
carelessness
in
the
perfection
too
and
had
an
almost
unattainable
matchlessness
in
the
sangfroid
of

languid
insolence

incredible

bertie
knew
very
well
that
he
was
ruined
the
breach
between

was
irrevocable
he
had
left
royallieu
as
soon
as
his

had
quitted
it

was
out
of

danger
he
had

no
help
from
the
old
lord
or
from
his
elder
brother
the
heir
and
now
every
chance
of
it
was
hopelessly
closed
nothing
but
the
whim
or
the
will
of
those
who
held
his
floating
paper
and
the
tradesmen
who
had
his
name
on
their
books
at
compound
interest
of
the
heaviest
stood
between
him
and
the
fatal
hour
when
he
must
send
in
his
papers
to
sell
and
be
nowhere
in
the
great
race
of
life
he
knew
that
a
season
a
month
a
day
might
be
the
only
respite
left
him
the
only
pause
for
him
his
glittering
luxurious
world
and
the
fiat
of
outlawry
and
exile
he
knew
that
the
jews
might
be
down
on
him
any
night
that
he
sat
at
the
guards
mess
flirted
with
foreign
princesses
or
laughed
at
the
gossamer
gossip
of
the
town
over
iced
drinks
in
the
clubs
his
liabilities
were
tremendous
his
resources
totally
exhausted
but
such
was
the
latent
recklessness
of
the
careless
royallieu
blood
and
such
the
languid
of
his
training
and
his
temper
that
the
knowledge
scarcely
ever
seriously
disturbed
his
enjoyment
of
the
moment
somehow
he
never
realized
it
if
any
weatherwise
had
told
the
lisbon
people
of
the
coming
of
the
great
earthquake
do
you
think
they
could
have
brought
themselves
to
realize
that
midnight
darkness
that
yawning
desolation
which
were
nigh
while
the
sun
was
still
so
bright
and
the
sea
so
tranquil
and
the
bloom
so
sweet
on
purple
pomegranate
and
amber
grape
and
the
scarlet
of
odorous
flowers
and
the
blush
of
a
girl
cheek
a
sentimental
metaphor
with
which
to
compare
the
difficulties
of
a
dandy
of
the
household
because
his
stiff
was
floating
about
in
too
many
directions
at
too
many
high
figures
and
he
had
hardly
enough
till
next
came
round
to
purchase
the
bouquets
he
sent
and
meet
the
that
were
due
but
after
all
may
it
not
well
be
doubted
if
a
sharp
shock
and
a
second
blindness
and
a
sudden
sweep
down
under
the
walls
of
the
cathedral
or
the
waters
of
the
tagus
were
not
on
the
whole
a
quicker
and
pleasanter
mode
of
extinction
than
that
social
earthquake
gone
to
the
bad
with
a
crash
and
the
lisbonites
did
not
more
disbelieve
in
and
dream
less
of
their
coming
ruin
than
cecil
did
his
while
he
was
doing
the
season
with
engagements
enough
in
a
night
to
spread
over
a
month
the
best
known
horses
in
the
town
a
dozen
sent
to
his
clubs
or
his
lodgings
in
a
day
and
the
newest
thing
in
soups
colts
beauties
neckties
perfumes
tobaccos
or
square
dances
waiting
his
dictum
to
become
the
fashion
how
you
do
go
on
with
those
women
beauty
growled
the
seraph
one
day
after
a
morning
of
fearful
hard
work
consequent
on
having
played
the
foot
guards
at
lord
and
in
an
unwary
moment
having
allowed
himself
to
be
decoyed
afterward
to
a
private
concert
and
very
nearly
proposed
to
in
consequence
during
a
symphony
in
a
an
impending
terror
from
which
he
could
hardly
restore
himself
of
his
jeopardized
safety
horribly
imprudent
not
a
bit
of
it
rejoined
beauty
serenely
that
is
the
superior
wisdom
and
beautiful
simplicity
of
making
love
to
your
wife
she
ca
marry
you
but
she
may
get
you
into
the
mused
the
seraph
who
had
gloomy
personal
recollection
of
having
been
twice
through
that
phase
of
law
and
life
and
of
having
been
enormously
mulcted
in
damages
because
he
was
a
duke
in
future
and
because
as
he
piteously
observed
on
the
occasion
you
could
make
that
fellow
cresswell
see
that
it
was
they
ran
away
with
me
each
time
oh
everybody
goes
through
the
somehow
or
other
answered
cecil
with
philosophy
it
like
the
church
the
commons
and
the
gallows
you
know
one
of
the
popular
and
it
the
only
law
court
where
the
robber
cuts
a
better
figure
than
the
robbed
laughed
the
seraph
consoling
himself
that
he
had
escaped
the
future
chance
of
showing
in
the
latter
class
of
marital
defrauded
by
shying
that
proposal
during
the
symphony
in
a
on
which
his
thoughts
ran
as
the
thoughts
of
one
who
has
just
escaped
from
an
alpine
crevasse
run
on
the
past
abyss
in
which
he
had
been
so
nearly
lost
forever
i
say
beauty
were
you
ever
near
doing
anything
serious
asking
anybody
to
marry
you
eh
i
suppose
you
have
been
they
do
make
such
awful
hard
running
on
one
and
the
poor
hunted
seraph
stretched
his
magnificent
limbs
with
the
sigh
of
a
martyred
innocent
i
was
once
only
once
ah
by
jove
and
what
saved
you
the
seraph
lifted
himself
a
little
with
a
sort
of
pitying
sympathizing
curiosity
toward
a
well
i
tell
you
said
bertie
with
a
sigh
as
of
a
man
who
hated
long
sentences
and
who
was
about
to
plunge
into
a
painful
past
ages
ago
day
i
was
at
a
drawing
room
year
blue
ruin
won
the
clearwell
for
royal
i
think
wedged
up
there
in
that
poking
place
i
saw
such
a
face
the
deuce
it
almost
makes
me
feel
enthusiastic
now
she
was
just
out
an
angel
with
a
train
she
had
delicious
eyes
like
a
spaniel
you
know
a
cheek
like
this
peach
and
lips
like
that
strawberry
there
on
the
top
of
your
ice
she
looked
at
me
and
i
was
in
love
i
knew
who
she
was
irish
lord
daughter
girl
i
could
have
had
for
the
asking
and
i
vow
that
i
thought
i
would
ask
her
i
actually
was
as
far
gone
as
that
i
actually
said
to
myself
i
hang
about
her
a
week
or
two
and
then
propose
you
hardly
believe
it
but
i
did
watched
her
presented
such
grace
such
a
smile
such
a
divine
lift
of
the
lashes
i
was
really
in
love
and
with
a
girl
who
would
marry
me
i
was
never
so
near
a
fatal
thing
in
my
life
well
asked
the
seraph
pausing
to
listen
till
he
let
the
ice
in
his
melt
away
when
you
have
been
so
near
breaking
your
neck
down
the
matrimonial
matterhorn
it
is
painfully
interesting
to
hear
how
your
friend
escaped
the
same
risks
of
descent
well
resumed
bertie
i
was
very
near
it
i
did
nothing
but
watch
her
she
saw
me
and
i
felt
she
was
as
flattered
and
as
touched
as
she
ought
to
be
she
blushed
most
enchantingly
just
enough
you
know
she
was
conscious
i
followed
her
i
contrived
to
get
close
to
her
as
she
passed
out
so
close
that
i
could
see
those
exquisite
eyes
lighten
and
gleam
those
exquisite
lips
part
with
a
sigh
that
beautiful
face
beam
with
the
sunshine
of
a
radiant
smile
it
was
the
dawn
of
love
i
had
taught
her
i
pressed
nearer
and
nearer
and
i
caught
her
soft
whisper
as
she
leaned
to
her
mother
i
so
hungry
i
could
eat
a
whole
chicken
the
sigh
the
smile
the
blush
the
light
were
for
her
dinner
not
for
me
the
spell
was
broken
forever
a
girl
whom
i
had
looked
at
could
think
of
wings
and
and
white
sauce
i
have
never
been
near
a
proposal
the
seraph
with
the
clarion
roll
of
his
gay
laughter
flung
a
hautboy
at
him
hang
you
beauty
if
i
did
think
you
were
going
to
tell
one
how
you
really
got
out
of
a
serious
thing
it
is
so
awfully
difficult
to
keep
clear
of
them
nowadays
those
teas
are
only
just
so
many
new
traps
what
became
of
her
eh
she
married
a
scotch
laird
and
became
socially
extinct
somewhere
among
the
hebrides
served
her
right
murmured
cecil
sententiously
only
think
what
she
lost
just
through
hungering
for
a
chicken
if
i
had
proposed
for
her
for
one
hardly
keeps
the
screw
up
to
such
as
that
when
one
is
cool
the
next
morning
i
would
have
made
her
the
fashion
with
which
masterly
description
in
one
phrase
of
all
he
could
have
done
for
the
debutante
who
had
been
hungry
in
the
wrong
place
cecil
lounged
out
of
the
club
to
drive
with
half
a
dozen
of
his
set
to
a
a
bacchanalian
with
the
and
her
sisters
for
the
naiads
and
the
household
for
their
tritons
a
whose
water
element
apparently
consisted
in
driving
down
to
richmond
dining
at
nine
being
three
hours
over
the
courses
contributing
seven
guineas
apiece
for
the
repast
listening
to
the
songs
of
the
café
alcazar
reproduced
with
matchless
elan
by
a
pretty
french
actress
being
pelted
with
brandy
cherries
by
the
seeing
their
best
cigars
thrown
away
by
pretty
pillagers
and
driving
back
again
to
town
in
the
soft
starry
night
with
the
gay
rhythms
ringing
from
the
as
the
leaders
dashed
along
in
a
stretching
gallop
down
the
kew
road
it
certainly
had
no
other
more
aquatic
feature
in
it
save
a
little
drifting
about
for
twenty
minutes
before
dining
in
toy
boats
and
punts
as
the
sun
was
setting
while
laura
lelas
the
brunette
actress
sang
a
barcarolle
venice
and
her
people
only
born
to
bloom
and
where
be
all
those
dear
dead
women
with
such
hair
too
what
become
of
all
the
gold
used
to
hang
and
brush
their
bosoms
i
feel
chilly
and
grown
old
it
did
not
set
cecil
thinking
however
after
browning
fashion
because
in
the
first
place
it
was
a
canon
with
him
never
to
think
at
all
in
the
second
if
put
to
it
he
would
have
averred
that
he
knew
nothing
of
venice
except
that
it
was
a
musty
old
bore
of
a
place
where
they
worried
you
about
visas
and
luggage
and
all
that
chloride
of
you
if
you
came
from
the
east
and
could
give
you
a
mount
if
it
were
ever
so
and
in
the
third
instead
of
longing
for
the
dear
dead
women
he
was
entirely
contented
with
the
lovely
living
ones
who
were
at
that
moment
puffing
the
smoke
of
his
scented
cigarettes
into
his
eyes
making
him
eat
lobster
drowned
in
chablis
or
pelting
him
with
bonbons
as
they
left
the
star
and
garter
laura
lelas
mounted
on
remembered
she
had
dropped
her
cashmere
in
the
dining
room
a
cashmere
is
a
parisian
soul
idol
and
fetich
servants
could
not
find
it
cecil
who
to
do
him
this
justice
was
always
as
courteous
to
a
comedienne
as
to
a
countess
went
himself
passing
the
open
window
of
another
room
he
recognized
the
face
of
his
little
brother
among
a
set
of
young
civil
service
fellows
attaches
and
cornets
they
had
no
women
with
them
but
they
had
brought
what
was
perhaps
worse
dice
for
hazard
and
were
turning
the
unconscious
star
and
garter
unto
an
impromptu
crockford
over
their
wine
little
berk
pretty
face
was
very
flushed
his
lips
were
set
tight
his
eyes
were
glittering
the
boy
had
the
gambler
passion
of
the
royallieu
blood
in
its
hottest
intensity
he
was
playing
with
a
terrible
eagerness
that
went
to
bertie
heart
with
the
same
sort
of
pang
of
remorse
with
which
he
had
looked
on
him
when
he
had
been
thrown
like
dead
on
his
bed
at
home
cecil
stopped
and
leaned
over
the
open
window
ah
young
one
i
did
not
know
you
were
here
we
are
going
home
will
you
come
he
asked
with
a
careless
nod
to
the
rest
of
the
young
fellows
berkeley
looked
up
with
a
wayward
irritated
annoyance
no
i
ca
he
said
irritably
do
you
see
we
are
playing
bertie
i
see
answered
cecil
with
a
dash
of
gravity
almost
of
sadness
in
him
as
he
leaned
farther
over
the
windowsill
with
his
cigar
in
his
teeth
come
away
he
whispered
kindly
as
he
almost
touched
the
boy
who
chanced
to
be
close
to
the
casement
hazard
is
the
very
deuce
for
anybody
and
you
know
royal
hates
it
come
with
us
berk
there
a
capital
set
here
and
i
going
to
half
a
dozen
good
houses
when
we
get
back
i
take
you
with
me
come
you
like
waltzing
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
the
lad
shook
himself
peevishly
a
sullen
cloud
over
his
fair
picturesque
boyish
face
let
me
alone
before
the
fellows
he
muttered
impatiently
i
come
i
tell
soit
cecil
shrugged
his
shoulders
left
the
window
found
the
cashmere
and
sauntered
back
to
the
drags
without
any
more
expostulation
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
could
never
be
annoyed
but
also
he
never
troubled
himself
to
utter
useless
words
moreover
he
had
never
been
in
is
life
much
in
earnest
about
anything
it
was
not
worth
while
a
pretty
fellow
i
am
to
turn
preacher
when
i
have
sins
enough
on
my
own
shoulders
for
twenty
he
thought
as
he
shook
the
ribbons
and
started
the
leaders
off
to
the
gay
music
of
laura
lelas
laughter
the
thoughts
that
had
crossed
his
mind
when
he
had
looked
on
his
brother
inanimate
form
had
not
been
wholly
forgotten
since
he
felt
something
like
whenever
he
saw
in
some
gray
summer
dawn
as
he
had
seen
now
the
boy
bright
face
haggard
and
pale
with
the
premature
miseries
of
the
gamester
or
heard
his
lamentations
over
his
losses
and
he
would
essay
with
all
the
consummate
tact
the
world
had
taught
him
to
persuade
him
from
his
recklessness
and
warn
him
of
the
consequences
but
little
berk
though
he
loved
his
elder
after
a
fashion
was
wayward
selfish
and
unstable
as
water
he
would
be
very
sorry
sometimes
very
repentant
and
would
promise
anything
under
the
sun
but
five
minutes
afterward
he
would
go
his
own
way
just
the
same
and
be
as
irritably
resentful
of
interference
as
a
proud
spoiled
temper
can
be
and
cecil
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
turn
mentor
would
light
a
cheroot
as
he
did
and
forget
all
about
it
the
boy
would
be
right
enough
when
he
had
had
his
swing
he
thought
bertie
philosophy
was
the
essence
of
he
would
have
defied
a
manfred
or
an
aylmer
of
aylmer
field
to
be
long
pursued
by
remorse
or
care
if
he
drank
the
right
cru
and
lived
in
the
right
set
if
it
be
very
severe
he
would
say
it
may
give
him
a
pang
once
a
twelvemonth
say
the
morning
after
a
whitebait
dinner
repentance
is
generally
the
fruit
of
indigestion
and
contrition
may
generally
be
traced
to
too
many
truffles
or
cecil
had
no
time
or
space
for
thought
he
never
thought
would
not
have
thought
seriously
for
a
kingdom
a
novel
idly
skimmed
over
in
bed
was
the
extent
of
his
literature
he
never
bored
himself
by
reading
the
papers
he
heard
the
news
earlier
than
they
told
it
and
as
he
lived
he
was
too
constantly
supplied
from
the
world
about
him
with
amusement
and
variety
to
have
to
do
anything
beyond
letting
himself
be
amused
quietly
fanned
as
it
were
with
the
lulling
punka
of
social
pleasure
without
even
the
trouble
of
pulling
the
strings
he
had
naturally
considerable
talents
and
an
almost
dangerous
facility
in
them
but
he
might
have
been
as
brainless
as
a
mollusk
for
any
exertion
he
gave
his
brain
if
i
were
a
professional
you
know
i
use
such
wits
as
i
have
but
why
should
i
now
he
said
on
one
occasion
when
a
fair
lady
reproached
him
with
this
inertia
the
best
style
is
only
just
to
say
yes
or
no
and
be
bored
even
in
saying
that
and
a
very
comfortable
style
it
is
too
you
get
amused
without
the
trouble
of
opening
your
but
if
everybody
were
equally
monosyllabic
how
then
you
would
not
get
amused
suggested
his
interrogator
a
brilliant
parisienne
well
everybody
is
pretty
nearly
said
bertie
but
there
are
always
a
lot
of
fellows
who
give
their
wits
to
get
their
dinners
social
rockets
you
know
who
will
always
fire
themselves
off
to
sparkle
instead
of
you
if
you
give
them
a
white
ball
at
the
clubs

get
them
a
card
for
good
houses
it
saves
you
so
much
trouble
it
is
such
a
bore
to
have
to
he
went
that
night
as
he
had
said
to
half
a
dozen
good
houses
midnight
receptions
and
waltzes
making
his
bow
in
a
cabinet
minister
vestibule
and
taking
up
the
thread
of
the
same
flirtation
at
three
different
balls
showing
himself
for
a
moment
at
a
premier
and
looking
eminently
graceful
and
weary
in
an
ambassadress
drawing
room
and
winding
up
the
series
by
a
dainty
little
supper
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
with
a
sparkling
party
of
french
actresses
as
bright
as
the
bubbles
of
their
own
clicquot
when
he
went
upstairs
to
his
own
bedroom
in
piccadilly
about
five
therefore
he
was
both
sleepy
and
tired
and
lamented
to
that
cherished
and
confidant
a
cheroot
the
brutal
demands
of
the
service
which
would
drag
him
off
in
five
hours
time
without
the
slightest
regard
to
his
feelings
to
take
share
in
the
hot
heavy
dusty
searching
work
of
a
up
at
the
scrubs
here
get
me
to
perch
as
quick
as
you
can
rake
he
murmured
dropping
into
an
armchair
astonished
that
rake
did
not
answer
he
saw
standing
by
him
instead
the
boy
berkeley
surprise
was
a
weakness
of
raw
inexperience
that
cecil
never
felt
his
gazette
as
or
the
presence
of
the
wandering
jew
in
his
lodgings
would
never
have
excited
it
in
him
in
the
first
place
he
would
have
merely
lifted
his
eyebrows
and
said
be
a
fearful
bore
in
the
second
he
would
have
done
the
same
and
murmured
queer
old
cad
surprised
therefore
he
was
not
at
the
boy
untimely
apparition
but
his
eyes
dwelt
on
him
with
a
mild
wonder
while
his
lips
dropped
but
one
word
was
a
colt
of
the
most
marvelous
promise
at
the
royallieu
establishment
looked
on
to
win
the
next
clearwell
guineas
and
derby
as
a
certainty
an
accident
to
the
young
chestnut
was
the
only
thing
that
suggested
itself
as
of
possibly
sufficient
importance
to
make
his
brother
wait
for
him
at
five
on
a
june
morning
berkeley
looked
up
confusedly
impatiently
you
are
never
thinking
but
of
horses
or
women
he
said
peevishly
there
may
be
others
things
in
the
world
indisputably
there
are
other
things
in
the
world
dear
boy
but
none
so
much
to
my
taste
said
cecil
composedly
stretching
himself
with
a
yawn
with
every
regard
to
hospitality
and
the
charms
of
your
society
might
i
hint
that
five
in
the
morning
is
not
precisely
the
most
suitable
hour
for
social
visits
and
ethical
questions
for
god
sake
be
serious
bertie
i
am
the
most
miserable
wretch
in
cecil
opened
his
closed
eyes
with
the
sleepy
indifference
vanished
from
them
and
a
look
of
genuine
and
affectionate
concern
on
the
serene
insouciance
of
his
face
ah
you
would
stay
and
play
that
chicken
hazard
he
thought
but
he
was
not
one
who
would
have
reminded
the
boy
of
his
own
advice
and
its
rejection
he
looked
at
him
in
silence
a
moment
then
raised
himself
with
a
sigh
dear
boy
why
did
you
sleep
upon
it
i
never
think
of
disagreeable
things
till
they
wake
me
with
my
coffee
then
i
take
them
up
with
the
cup
and
put
them
down
with
it
you
do
know
how
well
it
answers
it
disposes
of
them
the
boy
lifted
his
head
with
a
quick
reproachful
anger
and
in
the
gaslight
his
cheeks
were
flushed
his
eyes
full
of
tears
how
brutal
you
are
bertie
i
tell
you
i
am
ruined
and
you
care
no
more
than
if
you
were
a
stone
you
only
think
of
yourself
you
only
live
for
yourself
he
had
forgotten
the
money
that
had
been
tossed
to
him
off
that
very
table
the
day
before
the
grand
military
he
had
forgotten
the
debts
that
had
been
paid
for
him
out
of
the
winnings
of
that
very
race
there
is
a
childish
wayward
wailing
temper
which
never
counts
benefits
received
save
as
by
which
to
demand
others
cecil
looked
at
him
with
just
a
shadow
of
regret
not
reproachful
enough
to
be
rebuke
in
his
glance
but
did
not
defend
himself
in
any
way
against
the
boyish
passionate
accusation
nor
recall
his
own
past
gifts
into
remembrance
what
a
word
little
one
nobody
brutal
now
you
never
see
that
form
nowadays
come
what
is
the
worst
this
time
berkeley
looked
sullenly
down
on
the
table
where
his
elbows
leaned
scattering
the
the
french
novels
the
cigarettes
and
the
gold
with
which
it
was
strewn
there
was
something
dogged
yet
agitated
yet
irresolute
upon
him
that
was
new
there
the
worst
is
soon
told
he
said
huskily
and
his
teeth
chattered
together
slightly
as
though
with
cold
as
he
spoke
i
lost
two
hundred
i
must
pay
it
or
be
disgraced
forever
i
have
not
a
farthing
i
can
not
get
the
money
for
my
life
no
jews
will
lend
to
me
i
am
under
age
and
and
his
voice
sank
lower
and
grew
more
defiant
for
he
knew
that
the
sole
thing
forbidden
him
peremptorily
by
both
his
father
and
his
brothers
was
the
thing
he
had
now
to
tell
and
i
borrowed
three
ponies
of
granville
lee
yesterday
as
he
came
from
the
corner
with
a
lot
of
banknotes
after
i
told
him
i
would
pay
them
i
made
sure
i
should
have
won
the
piteous
unreason
of
the
born
gamester
who
clings
so
madly
to
the
belief
that
luck
must
come
to
him
and
sets
on
that
belief
as
though
a
bank
were
his
to
lose
his
gold
from
was
never
more
utterly
spoken
in
all
its
folly
in
all
its
pitiable
optimism
than
now
in
the
confession
bertie
started
from
his
chair
his
sleepy
languor
dissipated
on
his
face
the
look
that
had
come
there
when
lord
royallieu
had
dishonored
his
mother
name
in
his
code
there
was
one
shameless
piece
of
utter
and
unmentionable
degradation
it
was
to
borrow
of
a
friend
you
will
bring
some
disgrace
on
us
before
you
die
berkeley
he
said
with
a
keener
inflection
of
pain
and
contempt
than
had
ever
been
in
his
voice
have
you
no
common
knowledge
of
honor
the
lad
flushed
under
the
lash
of
the
words
but
it
was
a
flush
of
anger
rather
than
of
shame
he
did
not
lift
his
eyes
but
gazed
sullenly
down
on
the
yellow
paper
of
a
paris
romance
he
was
irritably
you
are
severe
enough
he
said
gloomily
and
yet
insolently
are
you
such
a
mirror
of
honor
yourself
i
suppose
my
debts
at
the
worst
are
about
of
for
a
moment
even
the
sweetness
of
cecil
temper
almost
gave
way
be
his
debts
what
they
would
there
was
not
one
among
them
to
his
friends
or
one
for
which
the
law
could
not
seize
him
he
was
silent
he
did
not
wish
to
have
a
scene
of
discussion
with
one
who
was
but
a
child
to
him
moreover
it
was
his
nature
to
abhor
scenes
of
any
sort
and
to
avert
even
a
dispute
at
any
cost
he
came
back
and
sat
down
without
any
change
of
expression
putting
his
cheroot
in
his
mouth
tres
cher
you
are
not
courteous
he
said
wearily
but
it
may
be
that
you
are
right
i
am
not
a
good
one
for
you
to
copy
from
in
anything
except
the
fit
of
my
coats
i
do
think
i
ever
told
you
i
was
i
am
not
altogether
so
satisfied
with
myself
as
to
suggest
myself
as
a
model
for
anything
unless
it
were
to
stand
in
a
tailor
window
in
bond
street
to
show
the
muffs
how
to
dress
that
is
the
point
though
you
say
you
want
near
pounds
by
rather
i
can
suggest
nothing
except
to
take
the
morning
mail
to
the
shires
and
ask
royal
straight
out
he
never
refuses
berkeley
looked
at
him
with
a
bewildered
terror
that
banished
at
a
stroke
his
sullen
defiance
he
was
irresolute
as
a
girl
and
keenly
moved
by
fear
i
would
rather
cut
my
throat
he
said
with
a
wild
exaggeration
that
was
but
the
literal
reflection
of
the
trepidation
on
him
as
i
live
i
would
i
have
had
so
much
from
him
lately
you
do
know
how
much
and
now
of
all
times
when
they
threaten
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
on
royallieu
what
foreclose
what
the
mortgage
answered
berkeley
impatiently
to
his
childish
egotism
it
seemed
cruel
and
intolerable
that
any
extremities
should
be
considered
save
his
own
you
know
the
lands
are
mortgaged
as
deeply
as
monti
and
the
entail
would
allow
them
they
threatened
to
foreclose
i
think
that
the
word
and
royal
has
had
god
knows
what
work
to
stave
them
off
i
no
more
dare
face
him
and
ask
him
for
a
sovereign
now
than
i
dare
ask
him
to
give
me
the
gold
plate
off
the
cecil
listened
gravely
it
cut
him
more
keenly
than
he
showed
to
learn
the
evils
and
the
ruin
that
so
closely
menaced
his
house
and
to
find
how
entirely
his
father
morbid
mania
against
him
severed
him
from
all
the
interests
and
all
the
confidence
of
his
family
and
left
him
ignorant
of
matters
even
so
nearly
touching
him
as
these
your
intelligence
is
not
cheerful
little
one
he
said
with
a
languid
stretch
of
his
limbs
it
was
his
nature
to
glide
off
painful
subjects
and
i
really
am
sleepy
you
think
there
is
no
hope
royal
would
help
you
i
tell
you
i
will
shoot
myself
through
the
brain
rather
than
ask
bertie
moved
restlessly
in
the
soft
depths
of
his
he
shunned
worry
loathed
it
escaped
it
at
every
portal
and
here
it
came
to
him
just
when
he
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
he
could
not
divest
himself
of
the
feeling
that
had
his
own
career
been
different
less
extravagant
less
dissipated
less
indolently
spendthrift
he
might
have
exercised
a
better
influence
and
his
brother
young
life
might
have
been
more
prudently
launched
upon
the
world
he
felt
too
with
a
sharper
pang
than
he
had
ever
felt
it
for
himself
the
brilliant
beggary
in
which
he
lived
the
utter
inability
he
had
to
raise
even
the
sum
that
the
boy
now
needed
a
sum
so
trifling
in
his
set
and
with
his
habits
that
he
had
betted
it
over
and
over
again
in
a
clubroom
on
a
single
game
of
whist
it
cut
him
with
a
bitter
impatient
pain
he
was
as
generous
as
the
winds
and
there
is
no
trial
keener
to
such
a
temper
than
the
poverty
that
paralyzes
its
power
to
give
it
is
no
use
to
give
you
false
hopes
young
one
he
said
gently
i
can
do
nothing
you
ought
to
know
me
by
this
time
and
if
you
do
you
know
too
that
if
the
money
was
mine
it
would
be
yours
at
a
word
if
you
do
no
matter
frankly
berk
i
am
all
my
bills
may
be
called
in
any
moment
when
they
are
i
must
send
in
my
papers
to
sell
and
cut
the
country
if
my
duns
do
catch
me
before
which
they
probably
will
in
which
event
i
shall
be
to
all
intents
and
purposes
dead
this
is
not
lively
conversation
but
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
say
that
it
was
not
i
who
introduced
it
only
one
word
for
all
my
boy
understand
this
if
i
could
help
you
i
would
cost
what
it
might
but
as
matters
stand
i
can
not
and
with
that
cecil
puffed
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
to
envelope
him
the
subject
was
painful
the
denial
wounded
him
by
whom
it
had
to
be
given
full
as
much
as
it
could
wound
him
whom
it
refused
berkeley
heard
it
in
silence
his
head
still
hung
down
his
color
changing
his
hands
nervously
playing
with
the
shutting
and
opening
their
gold
tops
no
yes
i
know
he
said
hurriedly
i
have
no
right
to
expect
it
and
have
been
behaving
like
a
cur
and
and
all
that
i
know
but
there
is
one
way
you
could
save
me
bertie
if
it
is
too
much
for
a
fellow
to
i
ca
say
i
see
the
way
little
one
said
cecil
with
a
sigh
what
is
it
why
look
here
you
see
i
not
of
age
my
signature
is
of
no
use
they
wo
take
it
else
i
could
get
money
in
no
time
on
what
must
come
to
me
when
royal
dies
though
is
enough
to
make
the
jews
at
a
risk
now
now
look
here
i
ca
see
that
there
could
be
any
harm
in
it
you
are
such
chums
with
lord
rockingham
and
he
as
rich
as
all
the
jews
put
together
what
could
there
be
in
it
if
you
just
asked
him
to
lend
you
a
monkey
for
me
he
do
it
in
a
minute
because
he
give
his
head
away
to
you
they
all
say
so
and
he
never
miss
it
now
bertie
will
you
in
his
boyish
incoherence
and
its
disjointed
inelegance
the
appeal
was
panted
out
rather
than
spoken
and
while
his
head
drooped
and
the
hot
color
burned
in
his
face
he
darted
a
swift
look
at
his
brother
so
full
of
dread
and
misery
that
it
pierced
cecil
to
the
quick
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
paced
the
room
flinging
his
cheroot
aside
the
look
disarmed
the
reply
that
was
on
his
lips
but
his
face
grew
dark
what
you
ask
is
impossible
he
said
briefly
if
i
did
such
a
thing
as
that
i
should
deserve
to
be
hounded
out
of
the
guards
the
boy
face
grew
more
sullen
more
haggard
more
evil
as
he
still
bent
his
eyes
on
the
table
his
glance
not
meeting
his
brother
you
speak
as
if
it
would
be
a
crime
he
muttered
savagely
with
a
plaintive
moan
of
pain
in
the
tone
he
thought
himself
cruelly
dealt
with
and
unjustly
punished
it
would
be
the
trick
of
a
swindler
and
it
would
be
the
shame
of
a
gentleman
said
cecil
as
briefly
still
that
is
answer
then
you
will
not
do
it
i
have
replied
there
was
that
in
the
tone
and
in
the
look
with
which
he
paused
before
the
table
that
berkeley
had
never
heard
or
seen
in
him
before
something
that
made
the
supple
childish
petulant
cowardly
nature
of
the
boy
shrink
and
be
silenced
something
for
a
single
instant
of
the
haughty
and
untamable
temper
of
the
royallieu
blood
that
awoke
in
the
too
feminine
softness
and
sweetness
of
cecil
disposition
you
said
that
you
would
aid
me
at
any
cost
and
now
that
i
ask
you
so
wretched
a
trifle
you
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
scoundrel
he
moaned
passionately
the
seraph
would
give
you
the
money
at
a
word
it
is
your
pride
nothing
but
pride
much
pride
is
worth
to
us
who
are
penniless
beggars
if
we
are
penniless
beggars
by
what
right
should
we
borrow
of
other
men
you
are
wonderfully
scrupulous
all
of
a
sudden
cecil
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
and
began
to
smoke
again
he
did
not
attempt
to
push
the
argument
his
character
was
too
indolent
to
defend
itself
against
aspersion
and
horror
of
a
quarrelsome
scene
far
greater
than
his
heed
of
misconstruction
you
are
a
brute
to
me
went
on
the
lad
with
his
querulous
and
bitter
passion
rising
almost
to
tears
like
a
woman
you
pretend
you
can
refuse
me
nothing
and
the
moment
i
ask
you
the
smallest
thing
you
turn
on
me
and
speak
as
if
i
were
the
greatest
blackguard
on
earth
let
me
go
to
the
bad
rather
than
bend
your
pride
to
save
me
you
live
like
a
duke
and
do
care
if
i
should
die
in
a
prison
you
only
brag
about
when
you
want
to
get
out
of
helping
a
fellow
and
if
i
were
to
cut
my
throat
you
would
only
shrug
your
shoulders
and
sneer
at
my
death
in
the
clubroom
with
a
jest
picked
out
of
your
cursed
french
novels
melodramatic
and
scarcely
correct
murmured
bertie
the
ingratitude
to
himself
touched
him
indeed
but
little
he
was
not
given
to
making
much
of
anything
that
was
due
to
himself
partly
through
carelessness
partly
through
generosity
but
the
absence
in
his
brother
of
that
delicate
intangible
indescribable
which
men
call
honor
an
absence
that
had
never
struck
on
him
so
vividly
as
it
did
troubled
him
surprised
him
oppressed
him
there
is
no
science
that
can
supply
this
defect
to
the
temperament
created
without
it
it
may
be
taught
a
counterfeit
but
it
will
never
own
a
reality
little
one
you
are
heated
and
do
know
what
you
say
he
began
very
gently
a
few
moments
later
as
he
leaned
forward
and
looked
straight
in
the
boy
eyes
do
be
down
about
this
you
will
pull
through
never
fear
listen
to
me
go
down
to
royal
and
tell
him
all
frankly
i
know
him
better
than
you
he
will
be
savage
for
a
second
but
he
would
sell
every
stick
and
stone
on
the
land
for
your
sake
he
will
see
you
safe
through
this
only
bear
one
thing
in
mind
tell
him
all
no
half
measures
no
half
confidences
tell
him
the
worst
and
ask
his
help
you
will
not
come
back
without
berkeley
listened
his
eyes
shunning
his
brother
the
red
color
darker
on
his
face
do
as
i
say
said
cecil
very
gently
still
tell
him
if
you
like
that
it
is
through
following
my
follies
that
you
have
come
to
grief
he
will
be
sure
to
pity
you
there
was
a
smile
a
little
sad
on
his
lips
as
he
said
the
last
words
but
it
passed
at
once
as
he
added
do
your
hear
me
will
you
go
if
you
want
me
on
your
word
now
on
my
there
was
an
impatience
in
the
answer
a
feverish
eagerness
in
the
way
he
assented
that
might
have
made
the
consent
rather
a
means
to
evade
the
pressure
than
a
genuine
pledge
to
follow
the
advice
that
darker
more
evil
more
defiant
look
was
still
upon
his
face
sweeping
its
youth
away
and
leaving
in
its
stead
a
wavering
shadow
he
rose
with
a
sudden
movement
his
tumbled
hair
his
disordered
attire
his
bloodshot
eyes
his
haggard
look
of
sleeplessness
and
excitement
in
strange
contrast
with
the
easy
perfection
of
cecil
dress
and
the
calm
languor
of
his
attitude
the
boy
was
very
young
and
was
not
seasoned
to
his
life
and
acclimatized
to
his
ruin
like
his
elder
brother
he
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
petulant
envy
the
envy
of
every
young
fellow
for
a
man
of
the
world
i
beg
your
pardon
for
keeping
you
up
bertie
he
said
huskily
cecil
gave
a
little
yawn
dear
boy
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
could
have
come
in
with
the
coffee
never
be
impulsive
do
do
a
bit
of
good
and
is
such
bad
form
he
spoke
lightly
serenely
both
because
such
was
as
much
his
nature
as
it
was
to
breathe
and
because
his
heart
was
heavy
that
he
had
to
send
away
the
young
one
without
help
though
he
knew
that
the
course
he
had
made
him
adopt
would
serve
him
more
permanently
in
the
end
but
he
leaned
his
hand
a
second
on
berk
shoulder
while
for
one
single
moment
in
his
life
he
grew
serious
you
must
know
i
could
not
do
what
you
asked
i
could
not
meet
any
man
in
the
guards
face
to
face
if
i
sunk
myself
and
sunk
them
so
low
you
see
that
little
one
there
was
a
wistfulness
in
the
last
words
he
would
gladly
have
believed
that
his
brother
had
at
length
some
perception
of
his
meaning
you
say
so
and
that
is
enough
said
the
boy
pettishly
i
can
not
understand
that
i
asked
anything
so
dreadful
but
i
suppose
you
have
too
many
needs
of
your
own
to
have
any
resources
left
for
cecil
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
again
and
let
him
go
but
he
could
not
altogether
banish
a
pang
of
pain
at
his
heart
less
even
for
his
brother
ingratitude
than
at
his
callousness
to
all
those
finer
better
instincts
of
which
honor
is
the
concrete
name
for
the
moment
thought
grave
weary
and
darkened
fell
on
him
he
had
passed
through
what
he
would
have
suffered
any
amount
of
misconstruction
to
escape
a
disagreeable
scene
he
had
been
as
unable
as
though
he
were
a
commissionaire
in
the
streets
to
advance
a
step
to
succor
the
necessities
for
which
his
help
had
been
asked
and
he
was
forced
despite
all
his
will
to
look
for
the
first
time
blankly
in
the
face
the
ruin
that
awaited
him
there
was
no
other
name
for
it
it
would
be
ruin
complete
and
wholly
inevitable
his
signature
would
have
been
accepted
no
more
by
any
in
london
he
had
forestalled
all
to
the
uttermost
farthing
his
debts
pressed
heavier
every
day
he
could
have
no
power
to
avert
the
crash
that
must
in
a
few
weeks
or
at
most
a
few
months
fall
upon
him
and
to
him
an
utter
blankness
and
darkness
lay
beyond
barred
out
from
the
only
life
he
knew
the
only
life
that
seemed
to
him
endurable
or
worth
the
living
severed
from
all
the
pleasures
pursuits
habits
and
luxuries
of
long
custom
deprived
of
all
that
had
become
to
him
as
second
nature
from
childhood
sold
up
penniless
driven
out
from
all
that
he
had
known
as
the
very
necessities
of
existence
his
very
name
forgotten
in
the
world
of
which
he
was
now
the
darling
a
man
without
a
career
without
a
hope
without
a
refuge
he
could
not
realize
that
this
was
what
awaited
him
then
this
was
the
fate
that
must
within
so
short
a
space
be
his
life
had
gone
so
smoothly
with
him
and
his
world
was
a
world
from
whose
surface
every
distasteful
thought
was
so
habitually
excluded
that
he
could
no
more
understand
this
desolation
lying
in
wait
for
him
than
one
in
the
fullness
and
elasticity
of
health
can
believe
the
doom
that
tells
him
he
will
be
a
dead
man
before
the
sun
has
set
as
he
sat
there
with
the
gas
of
the
mirror
branches
glancing
on
the
gold
and
silver
hilts
of
the
crossed
swords
above
the
fireplace
and
the
smoke
of
his
cheroot
curling
among
the
pile
of
invitation
cards
to
all
the
best
houses
in
town
cecil
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
things
were
really
come
to
this
pass
with
him
it
is
so
hard
for
a
man
who
has
the
magnificence
of
the
fashionable
clubs
open
to
him
day
and
night
to
beat
into
his
brain
the
truth
that
in
six
months
hence
he
may
be
lying
in
the
debtors
prison
at
baden
it
is
so
difficult
for
a
man
who
has
had
no
greater
care
on
his
mind
than
to
plan
the
courtesies
of
a
guards
ball
or
of
a
yacht
banquet
to
absolutely
conceive
the
fact
that
in
a
year
time
he
will
thank
god
if
he
have
a
few
francs
left
to
pay
for
a
wretched
dinner
in
a
miserable
estaminet
in
a
foreign
it
may
come
to
that
he
thought
something
may
happen
if
i
could
get
my
troop
now
that
would
stave
off
the
jews
or
if
i
should
win
some
heavy
pots
on
the
prix
de
dames
things
would
swim
on
again
i
must
win
the
king
will
be
as
fit
as
in
the
shires
and
there
will
only
be
the
french
horses
between
us
and
an
absolute
over
things
come
to
the
worst
after
and
so
careless
and
quickly
oblivious
happily
or
unhappily
was
his
temperament
that
he
read
himself
to
sleep
with
terrail
club
des
valets
de
coeur
and
slept
in
ten
minutes
time
as
composedly
as
though
he
had
inherited
fifty
thousand
a
year
that
evening
in
the
down
at
royallieu
forest
king
stood
without
any
for
the
night
was
close
and
sultry
a
lock
of
the
sweetest
hay
unnoticed
in
his
rack
and
his
favorite
standing
under
his
very
nose
the
king
was
in
the
height
of
excitation
alarm
and
haughty
wrath
his
ears
were
laid
flat
to
his
head
his
nostrils
were
distended
his
eyes
were
glancing
uneasily
with
a
nervous
angry
fire
rare
in
him
and
ever
and
anon
he
lashed
out
his
heels
with
a
tremendous
thundering
thud
against
the
opposite
wall
with
a
force
that
reverberated
through
the
stables
and
made
his
companions
start
and
edge
away
it
was
precisely
these
companions
that
the
aristocratic
hero
of
the
soldiers
blue
ribbon
scornfully
abhorred
they
had
just
been
looking
him
over
to
their
own
imminent
peril
and
the
patrician
winner
of
the
vase
the
brilliant
of
paris
and
shire
and
spa
fame
the
knightly
descendant
of
the
white
cockade
blood
and
of
the
coursers
of
circassia
had
resented
the
familiarity
proportionately
to
his
own
renown
and
dignity
the
king
was
a
very
horse
a
perfect
temper
indeed
and
ductile
to
a
touch
from
those
he
loved
but
he
liked
very
few
and
would
suffer
liberties
from
none
and
of
a
truth
his
prejudices
were
very
just
and
if
his
clever
heels
had
caught
and
it
was
not
his
fault
that
they
did
not
the
heads
of
his
two
companions
instead
of
coming
with
that
ponderous
crash
into
the
panels
of
his
box
society
would
certainly
have
been
no
loser
and
his
owner
would
have
gained
more
than
had
ever
before
hung
in
the
careless
balance
of
his
life
but
the
iron
heels
with
their
shining
plates
only
caught
the
oak
of
his
and
the
in
the
sultry
oppressive
night
went
on
as
the
speakers
moved
to
a
prudent
distance
one
of
them
thoughtfully
chewing
a
bit
of
straw
after
the
immemorial
habit
of
grooms
who
ever
seem
as
if
they
had
been
born
into
this
world
with
a
cornstalk
ready
in
their
mouths
it
almost
a
pity
he
in
such
perfect
condition
cool
as
a
cucumber
after
the
longest
licks
his
oats
up
to
the
last
grain
leads
the
whole
string
such
a
rattling
spin
as
never
was
spun
but
by
a
derby
cracker
before
him
it
almost
a
pity

meditatively
eyeing
his
charge

king
with
remorseful
glances

his
companion
with
a
whistle
in
his
teeth

ended
with
a
damnation

musingly
as
they
paced
homeward
together
from
the

with
the
long
line
of
the

before
and
behind
their
chargers
and
the

in

cecil
laughed
a
little
very
languidly
to
have
been
in
the
sun
for
four
hours
in
full
harness
had
almost
taken
out
of
him
any
power
to

at

he
went
on

pulling
down
his
what
a
fellow
to
do
when
he
smashed
eh
the
seraph
could
offer
a
suggestion
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
men
who
were
smashed
never
did
do
anything
except
accept
the
smashing
unless
indeed
they
turned
up
afterward
as
touts
of
which
he
had
an
equally
vague
suspicion

do

to
the

finally
suggested
the
seraph
lighting
a
great
cigar
without
heeding
the
presence
of

and
a
serene
highness
far
on
in

cecil
shook
his
head
ca
go
where
they
are
already
i

thinking
what
a
fellow
might
do
that
was
up
a
tree
and
on
my
honor
there
are
lots
of
things
one
might
turn
to

i
suppose
there
are
assented
the
seraph
with
a
shake
of
his
superb
limbs
in
his
saddle
till
his
cuirass
and
chains
and
scabbard
rang
again
i
should
try
the
only
they
will
have
you
one
might
do
better
than
the
getting
yourself
into
prime
condition
only
to
be
pounded
out
of
condition
and
into
a
jelly
seems
hardly
logical
or
satisfactory
specially
to
your
though
of
course
it
a
matter
of
taste
but
now
if
i
had
a
cropper
and
got

puffed
a

from

to
their

possible
returned
bertie
serenely
with

to
his
mustaches
anything
possible
if
i
do
now
it
strikes
me
there
are
vast
fields
gold

the

wholly

to
put
on
a
glove
it
an
art
and
an
art
that
requires
long
study
if
a
few
of
us
were
to
turn
when
we
are
fairly
crushed
we
might
civilize
the
whole
world
and
prevent
the
deformity
of
an
glove
ever
blotting
creation
and
prostituting
houbigant

do
you
say
do
be
such
a

the
seraph
while
his
charger
threatened
to

cart
you
do
appreciate
the
majesty
of
great
plans
rejoined
beauty
reprovingly
there
an
immense
deal
in
what
i
saying
think
what
we
might
do
for
society
think
how
we
might
extinguish
snobbery
if
we
just
dedicated
our
smash
to
mankind
we
might
open
a
college
where
the
traders
might
go
through
a
course
of
polite
training
before
they
blossomed
out
as
millionaires
the
world
would
be
spared
an
agony
of
dropped
h
and
bad
bows
we
might
have
a
bureau
where
we
registered
all
our
social
experiences
and
gave
the
plutocracy
a
map
of
belgravia
with
all
the
pitfalls
marked
all
the
inaccessible
heights
colored
red
and
all
the
great
people
dotted
with
gold
to
show
the
amount
be
bought
for
with
directions
to
the
ignoramuses
whom
to
know
court
and
avoid
we
might
form
a
courier
company
and
take
brummagem
abroad
under
our
guidance
so
that
the
continent
should
think
englishwomen
always
wear
blue
veils
and
gray
shawls
and
hear
every
englishman
shout
for
porter
and
beefsteak
in
tortoni
we
might
teach
them
to
take
their
hats
off
to
women
and
not
to
prod
pictures
with
sticks
and
to
look
at
statutes
without
poking
them
with
an
umbrella
and
to
be
persuaded
that
all
foreigners
do
want
to
be
bawled
at
and
wo
understand
bad
french
any
the
better
for
its
being
shouted
or
we
might
have
a
toilette
association
for
the
purposes
of
national
art
and
receive
brummagem
to
show
it
how
to
dress
we
might
even
succeed
in
making
the
feminine
british
public
drape
itself
properly
and
the
masculine
wear
boots
that
wo
creak
and
coats
that
do
wrinkle
and
take
off
its
hat
without
a
jerk
as
though
it
were
a
wooden
puppet
hung
on
very
stiff
strings
or
one
might
talk
the
greatest
nonsense
under
the

that
might

you
never

solemnly
those

chains
round
their

and
their
ineffable
supremacy
over
every
other
mortal
one
would
feel
in

superior

still
and
when
a
snob
came
to
poison
the
air
how
exquisitely
one
could
annihilate
him
with
showing
him
his
ignorance
of
claret
and
when
an
epicure
dined
how
delightfully
as
one
carried
in
a
turbot
one
could
test
him
with
the
eprouvette
positive
or
crush
him
by
the
eprouvette
negative
we
have
been
equerries
at
the
palace
both
of
us
but
i
do
think
we
know
what
true
dignity
is
till
we
shall
have
risen
to
headwaiters
at
a
grand
with
which
bertie
let
his
charger
pace
onward
while
he
reflected
thoughtfully
on
his
future
state
the
seraph
laughed
till
he
almost
swayed
out
of
saddle
but
he
shook
himself
into
his
balance
again
with
another
clash
of
his
brilliant
harness
while
his
eyes
lightened
and
glanced
with
a
fiery
gleam
down
the
line
of
the
household
cavalry
well
if
i
went
to
the
dogs
i
would
go
to
grand
hotels
but
tell
you
where
i
would
go
where
that
into
hot
service
somewhere
by
jove
i
see
some
good
fighting
under
another
flag
out
in
algeria
there
or
with
the
poles
or
after
garibaldi
i
would
in
a
day
i
not

i
wo
now
and
i
bet
you
ten
to
one
the
life
would
be
better
than
which
was
ungrateful
in
the
seraph
for
his
happy
temper
made
him
the
sunniest
and
most
contented
of
men
with
no
cross
in
his
life
save
the
dread
that
somebody
would
manage
to
marry
him
some
day
but
rock
had
the
true
dash
and
true
steel
of
the
soldier
in
him
and
his
blue
eyes
flashed
over
his
guards
as
he
spoke
with
a
longing
wish
that
he
were
leading
them
on
to
a
charge
instead
of
pacing
with
them
toward
hyde
park
cecil
turned
in
his
saddle
and
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
wonder
and
pleasure
in
his
glance
and
did
not
answer
aloud
the
deuce
that
not
a
bad
idea
he
thought
to
himself
and
the
idea
took
root
and
grew
with
him
far
down
very
far
down
so
far
that
nobody
had
ever
seen
it
nor
himself
ever
expected
it
there
was
a
lurking
instinct
in
beauty
the
instinct
that
had
prompted
him
when
he
sent
the
king
at
the
grand
military
cracker
with
that
prayer
kill
me
if
you
like
but
fail
me
which
out
of
the
languor
and
temper
of
his
unruffled
life
had
a
vague
restless
impulse
toward
the
fiery
perils
and
nervous
excitement
of
a
sterner
and
more
stirring
career
it
was
only
vague
for
he
was
naturally
very
indolent
very
gentle
very
addicted
to
taking
all
things
passively
and
very
strongly
of
persuasion
that
to
rouse
yourself
for
anything
was
a
niaiserie
of
the
strongest
possible
folly
but
it
was
there
it
always
is
there
with
men
of
bertie
order
and
only
comes
to
light
when
the
match
of
danger
is
applied
to
the
touchhole
then
though
the
tenth
do
dance
perhaps
with
graceful
indolent
dandy
insolence
they
can
fight
as
no
others
fight
when
boot
and
saddle
rings
through
the
morning
air
and
the
slashing
charge
sweeps
down
with
lightning
speed
and
falcon
swoop
in
the
case
of
a
countess
sir
the
imagination
is
more
excited
says
johnson
who
had
i
suppose
little
opportunity
of
putting
that
doctrine
for
amatory
intrigues
to
the
test
in
actual
practice
bertie
who
had
many
opportunities
differed
with
him
he
found
in
his
own
polished
tranquil
circles
apt
to
become
a
little
dull
and
was
more
amused
by
laura
lelas
however
he
was
sworn
to
the
service
of
the
guenevere
and
he
drove
his
down
that
day
to
another
sort
of
richmond
dinner
of
which
the
lady
was
the
object
instead
of
the
she
enjoyed
thinking
herself
the
wife
of
a
jealous
and
inexorable
lord
and
arranged
her
flirtations
to
evade
him
with
a
degree
of
skill
so
great
that
it
was
lamentable
it
should
be
thrown
away
on
an
agricultural
husband
who
never
dreamt
that
the
which
met
his
eyes
in
the
innocent
face
of
his
times
referred
to
an
appointment
at
a
regent
street
modiste
or
that
the
advertisement
white
wins
twelve
meant
that
if
she
wore
white
camellias
in
her
hair
at
the
opera
she
would
give
beauty
a
meeting
after
it
lady
guenevere
was
very
scrupulous
never
to
violate
conventionalities
and
yet
she
was
a
little
fast
very
fast
indeed
and
was
a
queen
of
one
of
the
fastest
sets
but
then
o
sacred
shield
of
a
wife
virtue
she
could
not
have
borne
to
lose
her
very
admirable
position
her
very
magnificent
jointure
and
above
all
the
superb
guenevere
diamonds
so
for
the
sake
of
the
diamonds
she
and
bertie
had
their
rendezvous
under
the
rose
this
day
she
went
down
to
see
a
dowager
baroness
aunt
out
at
hampton
court
really
went
she
was
never
so
imprudent
as
to
falsify
her
word
and
with
the
dowager
who
was
very
deaf
and
purblind
dined
at
richmond
while
the
world
thought
her
dining
at
hampton
court
it
was
nothing
to
anyone
since
none
knew
it
to
gossip
about
that
cecil
joined
her
there
that
over
the
star
and
garter
repast
they
arranged
their
meeting
at
baden
next
month
that
while
the
baroness
dozed
over
the
grapes
and
peaches
she
had
been
a
beauty
herself
in
her
own
day
and
still
had
her
sympathies
they
went
on
the
river
in
the
little
toy
that
he
kept
there
for
his
fair
friends
use
floating
slowly
along
in
the
coolness
of
evening
while
the
stars
loomed
out
in
the
golden
trail
of
the
sunset
and
doing
a
graceful
scene
a
la
musset
and
meredith
with
a
certain
languid
amusement
in
the
assumption
of
those
poetic
guises
for
they
were
of
the
world
worldly
and
neither
believed
very
much
in
the
other
when
you
have
just
dined
well
and
there
has
been
no
fault
in
the
clarets
and
the
scene
is
pretty
if
it
be
not
the
nile
in
the
afterglow
the
arno
in
the
moonlight
or
the
loire
in
but
only
the
thames
above
richmond
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
feel
a
touch
of
sentiment
when
you
have
a
beautiful
woman
beside
you
who
expects
you
to
feel
it
the
evening
was
very
hot
and
soft
there
was
a
low
south
wind
the
water
made
a
pleasant
murmur
wending
among
its
sedges
she
was
very
lovely
moreover
lying
back
there
among
her
laces
and
indian
shawls
with
the
sunset
in
the
brown
depths
of
her
eyes
and
on
her
delicate
cheek
and
bertie
as
he
looked
on
his
liege
lady
really
had
a
glow
of
the
old
real
foolish
forgotten
feeling
stir
at
his
heart
as
he
gazed
on
her
in
the
and
thought
almost
wistfully
if
the
jews
were
down
on
me
would
she
really
care
i
wonder
really
care
bertie
knew
his
world
and
its
women
too
well
to
deceive
himself
in
his
heart
about
the
answer
nevertheless
he
asked
the
question
would
you
care
much
chere
belle
care
what
if
i
came
to
grief
went
to
the
bad
you
know
dropped
out
of
the
world
altogether
she
raised
her
splendid
eyes
in
amaze
with
a
delicate
shudder
through
all
her
laces
bertie
you
would
break
my
heart
what
can
you
dream
of
oh
lots
of
us
end
so
how
is
a
man
to
end
answered
bertie
philosophically
while
his
thoughts
still
ran
off
in
a
speculative
skepticism
is
there
a
heart
to
break
her
ladyship
looked
at
him
an
laughed
a
werther
in
the
guards
i
do
think
the
role
will
suit
either
you
or
your
corps
bertie
but
if
you
do
it
pray
do
it
artistically
i
remember
last
year
driving
through
asnieres
when
they
had
found
a
young
man
in
the
seine
he
was
very
handsome
beautifully
dressed
and
he
held
fast
in
his
clinched
hand
a
lock
of
gold
hair
now
there
was
a
man
who
knew
how
to
die
gracefully
and
make
his
death
an
idyl
died
for
a
woman
ah
murmured
bertie
with
the
brummel
nonchalance
of
his
order
i
do
think
i
should
do
that
even
for
you
not
at
least
while
i
had
a
cigar
and
then
the
boat
drifted
backward
while
the
stars
grew
brighter
and
the
last
reflection
of
the
sun
died
out
and
they
planned
to
meet
and
talked
of
baden
and
sketched
projects
for
the
winter
in
paris
and
went
in
and
sat
by
the
window
taking
their
coffee
and
feeling
in
a
pleasure
the
air
blowing
softly
in
from
the
garden
below
and
the
quiet
of
the
starlit
river
in
the
summer
evening
with
a
white
sail
gleaming
here
and
there
or
the
gentle
splash
of
an
oar
following
on
the
swift
trail
of
a
steamer
the
quiet
so
still
and
so
strange
after
the
crowded
rush
of
the
london
season
would
she
really
care
thought
cecil
once
more
in
that
moment
he
could
have
wished
to
think
she
would
but
heliotrope
stars
and
a
river
even
though
it
had
been
tawny
and
classical
tiber
instead
of
and
inodorous
thames
were
not
things
sufficiently
in
the
way
of
either
of
them
to
detain
them
long
they
had
both
seen
the
babylonian
sun
set
over
the
ruins
of
the
birs
nimrud
and
had
talked
of
paris
fashions
while
they
did
so
they
had
both
leaned
over
the
terraces
of
bellosguardo
while
the
moon
was
full
on
giotto
tower
and
had
discussed
their
dresses
for
the
veglione
masquerade
it
was
not
their
style
to
care
for
these
matters
they
were
pretty
to
be
sure
but
they
had
seen
so
many
of
them
the
dowager
went
home
in
her
brougham
the
countess
drove
in
his
objectionable
as
she
might
be
seen
but
less
objectionable
than
letting
her
servants
know
he
had
met
her
at
richmond
besides
she
obviated
danger
by
bidding
him
set
her
down
at
a
little
villa
across
the
park
where
dwelt
a
confidential
protegee
of
hers
whom
she
patronized
a
former
french
governess
married
tolerably
well
who
had
the
countess
confidences
and
kept
them
religiously
for
sake
of
so
aristocratic
a
patron
and
of
innumerable
reversions
of
spanish
point
and
shawls
that
had
never
been
worn
and
rings
of
which
her
lavish
ladyship
had
got
tired
from
here
she
would
take
her
little
brougham
and
get
quietly
back
to
her
own
home
in
eaton
square
in
due
time
for
all
the
drums
and
crushes
at
which
she
must
make
her
appearance
this
was
the
sort
of
little
device
which
really
made
them
think
themselves
in
love
and
gave
the
salt
to
the
whole
affair
moreover
there
was
this
ground
for
it
that
had
her
lord
once
roused
from
the
of
his
prize
cattle
there
was
a
certain
stubborn
irrational
prejudice
of
pride
and
temper
in
him
that
would
have
made
him
throw
expediency
to
the
winds
then
and
there
with
a
blind
and
brutal
disregard
to
slander
and
to
the
fact
that
none
would
ever
adorn
his
diamonds
as
she
did
so
that
cecil
had
not
only
her
fair
fame
but
her
still
more
valuable
jewels
in
his
keeping
when
he
started
from
the
star
and
garter
in
the
warmth
of
the
bright
summer
evening
it
was
a
lovely
night
a
night
for
lonely
highland
tarns
and
southern
shores
by
baiae
without
a
cloud
to
veil
the
brightness
of
the
stars
a
heavy
dew
pressed
the
odors
from
the
grasses
and
the
deep
glades
of
the
avenue
were
pierced
here
and
there
with
a
broad
beam
of
silvery
moonlight
slanting
through
the
massive
boles
of
the
trees
and
falling
white
and
serene
across
the
turf
through
the
park
with
the
gleam
of
the
water
ever
and
again
shining
through
the
branches
of
the
foliage
cecil
started
his
horses
his
groom
he
had
sent
away
on
reaching
richmond
for
the
same
reason
as
the
countess
had
dismissed
her
barouche
and
he
wanted
no
servant
since
as
soon
as
he
had
set
down
his
liege
lady
at
her
protegee
he
would
drive
straight
back
to
piccadilly
but
he
had
not
noticed
what
he
noted
now
that
instead
of
one
of
his
who
had
fallen
slightly
lame
they
had
put
into
harness
the
young
one
maraschino
who
matched
admirably
for
size
and
color
but
who
being
really
a
hunter
though
he
had
been
broken
to
shafts
as
well
was
not
the
horse
with
which
to
risk
driving
a
lady
however
beauty
was
a
perfect
whip
and
had
the
pair
perfectly
in
hand
so
that
he
thought
no
more
of
the
change
as
the
grays
dashed
at
a
liberal
through
the
park
with
their
harness
flashing
in
the
moonlight
and
their
scarlet
rosettes
fluttering
in
the
pleasant
air
the
eyes
beside
him
the
mouth
the
rich
delicate
cheek
these
were
to
be
sure
rather
against
the
coolness
and
science
that
such
a
as
maraschino
required
they
were
distracting
even
to
cecil
and
he
had
not
prudence
enough
to
deny
his
sovereign
lady
when
she
put
her
hands
on
the
ribbons
the
beauties
give
them
to
me
bertie
dangerous
how
absurd
you
are
as
if
i
could
not
drive
anything
do
you
remember
my
four
roans
at
longchamps
she
could
indeed
with
justice
pique
herself
on
her
skill
she
drove
matchlessly
but
as
he
resigned
them
to
her
maraschino
and
his
companion
quickened
their
trot
and
tossed
their
pretty
thoroughbred
heads
conscious
of
a
less
powerful
hand
on
the
reins
i
shall
let
their
pace
out
there
is
nobody
to
run
over
here
said
her
ladyship
maraschino
as
though
hearing
the
flattering
conjuration
swung
off
into
a
light
quick
canter
and
tossed
his
head
again
he
knew
that
good
whip
though
she
was
he
could
jerk
his
mouth
free
in
a
second
if
he
wanted
cecil
laughed
prudence
was
at
no
time
his
virtue
and
leaned
back
contentedly
to
be
driven
at
a
slashing
pace
through
the
balmy
summer
night
while
the
ring
of
the
hoofs
rang
merrily
on
the
turf
and
the
boughs
were
tossed
aside
with
a
dewy
fragrance
as
they
went
the
moonlight
was
shed
about
their
path
in
the
full
of
the
young
night
and
at
the
end
of
a
vista
of
boughs
on
a
grassy
knoll
were
some
phantom
forms
the
same
graceful
shapes
that
stand
out
against
the
purple
heather
and
the
tawny
gorse
of
scottish
moorlands
while
the
lean
creeps
up
by
stealth
in
the
clear
starlight
there
stood
the
deer
a
dozen
of
them
a
clan
of
stags
alone
with
their
antlers
clashing
like
a
clash
of
swords
and
waving
like
swaying
banners
as
they
tossed
their
heads
and
listened
let
me
here
take
leave
to
beg
pardon
of
the
gallant
highland
stags
for
comparing
them
one
instant
with
the
shabby
wretches
that
travesty
them
in
richmond
park
after
seeing
these
latter
scrubby
meager
apologies
for
deer
one
wonders
why
something
better
can
not
be
turned
loose
there
a
i
know
well
nevertheless
flattered
them
thus
by
racing
them
through
the
park
when
in
harness
herself
to
her
own
great
disgust
in
an
instant
the
hunter
pricked
his
ears
snuffed
the
air
and
twitched
with
passionate
impatience
at
his
bit
another
instant
and
he
had
got
his
head
and
launching
into
a
sweeping
gallop
rushed
down
the
glade
cecil
sprang
forward
from
his
lazy
rest
and
seized
the
ribbons
that
in
one
instant
had
cut
his
companion
gloves
to
stripes
sit
still
he
said
calmly
but
under
his
breath
he
had
been
always
ridden
with
the
buckhounds
he
will
race
the
deer
as
sure
as
we
live
race
the
deer
he
did
startled
and
fresh
for
their
favorite
nightly
wandering
the
stags
were
off
like
the
wind
at
the
noise
of
alarm
and
the
horses
tore
after
them
no
skill
no
strength
no
science
could
avail
to
pull
them
in
they
had
taken
their
bits
between
their
teeth
and
the
devil
that
was
in
maraschino
lent
the
contagion
of
sympathy
to
the
young
carriage
mare
who
had
never
gone
at
such
a
pace
since
she
had
been
first
put
in
her
break
neither
cecil
hands
nor
any
other
force
could
stop
them
now
on
they
went
hunting
as
straight
in
line
as
though
staghounds
streamed
in
front
of
them
and
no
phaeton
rocked
and
swayed
in
a
dead
and
dragging
weight
behind
them
in
a
moment
he
gauged
the
closeness
and
the
vastness
of
the
peril
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
trust
to
chance
to
keep
his
grasp
on
the
reins
to
the
last
and
to
watch
for
the
first
sign
of
exhaustion
long
ere
that
should
be
given
death
might
have
come
to
them
both
but
there
was
a
gay
excitation
in
that
headlong
rush
through
the
summer
night
there
was
a
of
mirth
and
mischief
in
that
dash
through
the
starlit
woodland
there
was
a
reckless
breathless
pleasure
in
that
moonlight
chase
yet
danger
was
so
near
with
every
oscillation
the
deer
were
trooping
in
fast
flight
now
clear
in
the
moonlight
now
lost
in
the
shadow
bounding
with
their
lightning
grace
over
sward
and
hillock
over
briar
and
brushwood
at
that
speed
which
kills
most
living
things
that
dare
to
race
the
monarch
of
the
and
the
grays
were
in
full
pursuit
the
hunting
fire
was
in
the
fresh
young
horse
he
saw
the
shadowy
branches
of
the
antlers
toss
before
him
and
he
knew
no
better
than
to
hunt
down
in
their
scenting
line
as
hotly
as
though
the
field
of
the
queen
or
the
baron
was
after
them
what
cared
he
for
the
phaeton
that
rocked
and
reeled
on
his
traces
he
felt
its
weight
no
more
than
if
it
were
a
toy
and
extended
like
a
greyhound
he
swerved
from
the
road
swept
through
the
trees
and
tore
down
across
the
grassland
in
the
track
of
the
herd
through
the
great
boles
of
the
trunks
bronze
and
black
in
the
shadows
across
the
hilly
rises
of
the
turf
through
the
brushwood
and
crash
across
the
level
stretches
of
the
sward
they
raced
as
though
the
hounds
were
streaming
in
front
swerved
here
tossed
there
carried
in
a
whirlwind
over
the
mounds
wheeled
through
the
gloom
of
the
woven
branches
splashed
with
a
hiss
through
the
shallow
shot
swift
as
an
arrow
across
the
silver
radiance
of
the
broad
moonlight
borne
against
the
sweet
south
wind
and
down
the
odors
of
the
trampled
grass
the
carriage
was
hurled
across
the
park
in
the
wild
starlight
chase
it
rocked
it
swayed
it
shook
at
every
yard
while
it
was
carried
on
like
a
paper
toy
as
yet
the
marvelous
chances
of
accident
had
borne
it
clear
of
the
destruction
that
threatened
it
at
every
step
as
the
grays
in
the
height
of
their
pace
now
and
powerless
even
to
have
arrested
themselves
flew
through
the
woodland
neither
knowing
what
they
did
nor
heeding
where
they
went
but
racing
down
on
the
scent
not
feeling
the
strain
of
the
traces
and
only
maddened
the
more
by
the
noise
of
the
whirling
wheels
behind
them
as
cecil
leaned
back
his
hands
clinched
on
the
reins
his
sinews
stretched
almost
to
bursting
in
their
vain
struggle
to
recover
power
over
the
loosened
beasts
the
hunting
zest
awoke
in
him
too
even
while
his
eyes
glanced
on
his
companion
in
fear
and
anxiety
for
her
hark
forward
as
i
live
it
is
glorious
he
cried
half
unconsciously
for
god
sake
sit
still
beatrice
i
will
save
inconsistent
as
the
words
were
they
were
true
to
what
he
felt
alone
he
would
have
flung
himself
delightedly
into
the
madness
of
the
chase
for
her
he
dreaded
with
horror
the
eminence
of
their
peril
on
fled
the
deer
on
swept
the
horses
faster
in
the
gleam
of
the
moonlight
the
antlered
troop
darted
on
through
the
gloaming
faster
tore
the
grays
in
the
ecstasy
of
their
freedom
headlong
and
heedless
they
dashed
through
the
thickness
of
leaves
and
the
weaving
of
branches
neck
to
neck
straining
to
distance
each
other
and
held
together
by
the
gall
of
the
harness
the
broken
boughs
snapped
the
earth
flew
up
beneath
their
hoofs
their
feet
struck
scarlet
sparks
of
fire
from
the
stones
the
carriage
was
whirled
rocking
and
tottering
through
the
maze
of
towering
like
pillars
of
black
stone
up
against
the
clearness
of
the
sky
the
strain
was
intense
the
danger
deadly
suddenly
straight
ahead
beyond
the
darkness
of
the
foliage
gleamed
a
line
of
light
shimmering
liquid
and
glassy
here
brown
as
gloom
where
the
shadows
fell
on
it
here
light
as
life
where
the
stars
mirrored
on
it
that
trembling
line
stretched
right
in
their
path
for
the
first
time
from
the
blanched
lips
beside
him
a
cry
of
terror
rang
the
river
oh
heaven
the
river
there
it
lay
in
the
distance
the
deep
and
yellow
water
cold
in
the
moon
rays
with
its
further
bank
but
a
dull
gray
line
in
the
mists
that
rose
from
it
and
its
swamp
a
yawning
grave
as
the
horses
blind
in
their
delirium
and
racing
against
each
other
bore
down
through
all
obstacles
toward
its
brink
death
was
rarely
ever
closer
one
score
yards
more
one
plunge
one
crash
down
the
declivity
and
against
the
rails
one
swell
of
the
noisome
tide
above
their
heads
and
life
would
be
closed
and
passed
for
both
of
them
for
one
breathless
moment
his
eyes
met
hers
in
that
moment
he
loved
her
in
that
moment
their
hearts
beat
with
a
truer
fonder
impulse
to
each
other
than
they
had
ever
done
before
the
presence
of
a
threatening
death
life
grows
real
love
grows
precious
to
the
coldest
and
most
careless
no
aid
could
come
not
a
living
soul
was
nigh
the
solitude
was
as
complete
as
though
a
western
prairie
stretched
round
them
there
were
only
the
still
and
shadowy
night
the
chilly
silence
on
which
the
beat
of
the
plunging
hoofs
shattered
like
thunder
and
the
glisten
of
the
flowing
water
growing
nearer
and
nearer
every
yard
the
tranquillity
around
only
jarred
more
horribly
on
ear
and
brain
the
vanishing
forms
of
the
antlered
deer
only
gave
a
weirder
grace
to
the
moonlight
chase
whose
goal
was
the
grave
it
was
like
the
midnight
hunt
after
herne
the
hunter
but
here
behind
them
hunted
death
the
animals
neither
saw
nor
knew
what
waited
them
as
they
rushed
down
on
to
the
broad
gray
stream
veiled
from
them
by
the
slope
and
the
screen
of
flickering
leaves
to
save
them
there
was
but
one
chance
and
that
so
desperate
that
it
looked
like
madness
it
was
but
a
thought
he
gave
it
but
a
second
resolve
the
next
instant
he
stood
on
his
feet
as
the
carriage
swayed
to
and
fro
over
the
turf
balanced
himself
marvelously
as
it
staggered
in
that
furious
gallop
from
side
to
side
clinched
the
reins
hard
in
the
grip
of
his
teeth
measured
the
distance
with
an
unerring
eye
and
crouching
his
body
for
the
spring
with
all
the
science
of
the
old
of
his
eton
days
cleared
the
dashboard
and
lighted
astride
on
the
back
of
the
hunting
old
how
he
could
never
have
remembered
or
have
told
the
tremendous
pace
at
which
they
went
swayed
him
with
a
lurch
and
a
reel
over
the
a
woman
cry
rang
again
clear
and
shrill
and
agonized
on
the
night
a
moment
more
and
he
would
have
fallen
head
downward
beneath
the
horses
feet
but
he
had
ridden
stirrupless
and
saddleless
ere
now
he
recovered
himself
with
the
suppleness
of
an
arab
and
behind
the
collar
with
one
leg
crushed
between
the
pole
and
maraschino
flanks
gathering
in
the
ribbons
till
they
were
as
a
bridle
he
strained
with
all
the
might
and
sinew
that
were
in
him
to
get
the
grays
in
hand
before
they
could
plunge
down
into
the
water
his
wrists
were
wrenched
like
pulleys
the
resistance
against
him
was
hard
as
iron
but
as
he
had
risked
life
and
limb
in
the
leap
which
had
seated
him
across
the
harnessed
loins
of
the
now
terrified
beast
so
he
risked
them
afresh
to
get
the
mastery
now
to
slacken
them
turn
them
ever
so
slightly
and
save
the
woman
he
loved
loved
at
least
in
this
hour
as
he
had
not
loved
her
before
one
moment
more
while
the
beast
rushed
through
the
shadows
one
moment
more
till
the
river
stretched
full
before
them
in
all
its
length
and
breadth
without
a
living
thing
upon
its
surface
to
break
the
still
and
awful
calm
one
moment
and
the
force
of
cool
command
conquered
and
broke
their
wills
despite
themselves
the
hunter
knew
his
master
voice
his
touch
his
pressure
and
slackened
speed
by
an
irresistible
almost
unconscious
habit
of
obedience
the
carriage
mare
checked
and
galled
in
the
full
height
of
her
speed
stood
erect
pawing
the
air
with
her
forelegs
and
flinging
the
white
froth
over
her
withers
while
she
plunged
blindly
in
her
nervous
terror
then
with
a
crash
her
feet
came
down
upon
the
ground
the
broken
harness
shivered
together
with
a
sharp
metallic
clash
snorting
panting
quivering
trembling
the
pair
stood
passive
and
vanquished
the
carriage
was
overthrown
but
the
high
and
fearless
courage
of
the
peeress
bore
her
unharmed
even
as
she
was
flung
out
on
to
the
yielding
turf
fair
as
she
was
in
every
hour
she
had
never
looked
fairer
than
as
he
swung
himself
from
the
now
powerless
horses
and
threw
himself
beside
her
my
love
my
love
you
are
saved
the
beautiful
eyes
looked
up
half
unconscious
the
danger
told
on
her
now
that
it
was
passed
as
it
does
most
commonly
with
women
saved
lost
all
the
world
must
know
now
that
you
are
with
me
this
evening
she
murmured
with
a
shudder
she
lived
for
the
world
and
her
first
thought
was
of
self
he
soothed
her
tenderly
hush
be
at
rest
there
is
no
injury
but
what
i
can
repair
nor
is
there
a
creature
in
sight
to
have
witnessed
the
accident
trust
in
me
no
one
shall
ever
know
of
this
you
shall
reach
town
safely
and
and
while
he
promised
he
forgot
that
he
thus
pledged
his
honor
to
leave
four
hours
of
his
life
so
buried
that
however
much
he
needed
he
neither
should
nor
could
account

heavily
bit
there
could
be
no
medium
he
never
hedged
in
his
life
and
as
it
was
almost
a
practical
impossibility
that
anything
the
foreign
stables
could
get
together
would
even
be
able
to
land
within
half
a
dozen
lengths
of

come
to
baden
and
was
amusing
himself
there
dropping
a
friedrich
on
the
rouge
flirting
in
the
shady
alleys
of
the
lichtenthal
waltzing
lady
guenevere
down
the
ballroom
playing
ecarte
with
some
serene
highness
supping
with
the
and
her
set
and
occupying
rooms
that
a
russian
prince
had
had
before
him
with
all
the
serenity
of
a
millionaire
as
far
as
memory
of
money
went
with
much
more
than
the
serenity
in
other
matters
of
most
millionaires
who
finding
themselves
uncommonly
ill
at
ease
in
the
of
monarchs
and
ministers
of

would
have
given
half
their
newly
turned
thousands
to
get
rid
of
the
odor
of
capel
court
and
the
bourse
and
to
attain
the
calm
negligent
assurance
the
easy
tranquil
insolence
the
nonchalance
with
princes
and
the
supremacy
among
the
free
lances
which
they
saw
and
coveted
in
the
indolent
guardsman
bertie
amused
himself
he
might
be
within
a
day
of
his
ruin
but
that
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
sip
his
iced
sherbet
and
laugh
with
a
pretty
french
actress
his
epicurean
formulary
was
the
same
as
old
herrick
and
he
would
have
paraphrased
this
poet
famous
quatrain
into
drink
a
pure
claret
while
you
may
your
stiff
is
still
and
he
who
dines
so
well
may
be
lying
pounced
down
upon
by
jews
or
outlawed
in
a
french
bertie
was
a
great
believer
if
the
words
are
not
too
sonorous
and
too
earnest
to
be
applied
to
his
very
inconsequent
views
upon
any
and
everything
in
the
philosophy
of
happy
accident
far
as
it
was
in
him
to
have
a
conviction
at
all
which
was
a
serious
sort
of
thing
not
by
any
means
his
form
he
had
a
conviction
that
the
doctrine
of
eat
drink
and
enjoy
for
we
die
was
a
universal
panacea
he
was
reckless
to
the
uttermost
stretch
of
recklessness
all
serene
and
quiet
though
his
pococurantism
and
his
daily
manner
were
and
while
subdued
to
the
undeviating
monotone
and
languor
of
his
peculiar
set
in
all
his
temper
and
habits
the
natural
in
him
took
out
its
inborn
instincts
in
a
wildly
careless
and
imprudence
with
that
most
touchy
tempered
and
inconsistent
of
all
coquettes
fortune
things
he
thought
could
not
well
be
worse
with
him
than
they
were
now
so
he
piled
all
on
one
coup
and
stood
to
be
sunk
or
saved
by
the
prix
de
dames
meanwhile
all
the

a

charmed
a
monarch
by
unfolding
the
secret
of
the
aroma
of
a
guards
punch
sacred
to
the

bertie
who
believed
in
bivalves
but
not
in
heroics
thought
it
best
to
take
the
oysters
first
and
eschew
the
despair
entirely
he
had
one
unchangeable
quality
insouciance
and
he
had
moreover
one
unchangeable
faith
the
king
lady
guenevere
had
reached
home
unnoticed
after
the
accident
of
their
moonlight
his
brother
meeting
him
a
day
or
two
after
their
interview
had
nodded
affirmatively
though
sulkily
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
and
had
murmured
that
it
was
all
square
the
jews
and
the
tradesmen
had
let
him
leave
for
baden
without
more
serious
measures
than
a
menace
more
or
less
insolently
worded
in
the
same
fashion
he
trusted
that
the
king
running
at
the
bad
with
the
moneys
he
had
on
it
would
set
all
things
right
for
a
little
while
when
if
his
family
interest
which
was
great
would
get
him
his
step
in
the
first
life
he
thought
desperate
as
things
were
they
might
come
round
again
smoothly
without
a
notorious
crash
you
are
sure
the
king
will

asked
lady
guenevere
who
had
some
hundreds
in

and
even
under
the
rose
sported
a

so
more
seriously
on
the

pretty
a

for
your

as
picturesque
as
possible
would
it
be
well
to
give
me
a
lock

in

laughed
and
shook
her
head
if
a
man
killed
himself
she
did
not
desire
that
her
gracious
name
should
be
entangled
with
the
folly
no
i
do
do
those
things
she
said
with
captivating
waywardness
besides
though
the

looks
cool
and
pleasant
i
greatly
doubt
that
under
any
pressure
you
would
trouble
it
suicides

too
pronounced
for
your

at

a
little

would
be
quieter
and

said
cecil
while
he
caught
himself
listlessly
wondering
as
he
had
wondered
at
richmond
if
this
badinage
were
to
turn
into
serious
fact
how
much

your

be
forgiven

chesterfield

and

up

cecil

chesterfield
the

you
said
scores
of

what
a

can
you
tell
us
yourself
that
you
in

hard

as
you
were
when
you
won
the
military
eh
cecil
shook
his
head
with
a
sigh
i
do
think
i
am
i
had
things
to
try
me
you
see
there
was
that
verschoyle
proposal
i
did
absolutely
think
at
one
time
she
marry
me
before
i
could
protest
against
it
then
there
was
that
shock
to
whole
nervous
system
when
that
indigo
man
who
took
lady
laura
house
asked
us
to
dinner
and
actually
thought
we
should
go
and
there
was
a
scene
you
know
of
all
earthly
horrors
when
gervase
was
so
near
eloping
with
me
and
gervase
cut
up
rough
instead
of
pitying
me
and
then
the
were
so
many
and
so
late
into
the
season
and
i
exhausted
myself
so
at
the
belvoir
theatricals
at
easter
and
i
toiled
so
atrociously
playing
at
your
place
seraph
a
private
opera
galley
slave
work
and
altogether
i
had
a
good
many
things
to
pull
me
down
since
the
winter
concluded
bertie
with
a
plaintive
over
his
truffles
the
rest
of
his
condemning
judges
laughed
and
passed
the
plea
of
sympathy
the
coldstreamer
alone
remained
censorious
and
untouched
pull
you
down
you
never
pull
off
the
race
if
you
sit
drinking
liqueurs
all
the
morning
growled
that

cecil
shrugged
his

and
raised
his
eyebrows
a
little
all
the
better
for
us
take
all
they
lay
against
me
it
as
good
as
our

if
any

get

against

it

mean
mischief
as
it

are
you

shook
his

repudiatingly
never

i
a

a

chameleon
are
you
so
sure
of
the

then
my
dear
fellow
no
i
ask
you
in
reason
how
can
i
be
sure
of
what
is
proved
i
like
that
country
fellow
the
old
story
tells
of
he
believed
in
fifteen
shillings
because
he
once
had
it
in
his
hand
others
he
heard
believed
in
a
pound
but
for
his
part
he
did
because
he
never
seen
it
now
that
was
a
man
who
never
commit
himself
he
might
had
had
the
exchequer
i
the
same
i
believe
the
king
can
win
at
a
good
many
things
because
i
seen
him
do
but
i
ca
possibly
tell
whether
he
can
get
this
because
i
never
ridden
him
for
it
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
at
three
but
that
you
do
care
for
and
bertie
exhausted
with
making
such
a
lengthened
exposition
the
speeches
he
preferred
were
monosyllabic
completed
his
sins
against
training
with
a
long
draught
of
then
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
telling
us
to
pile
our
pots
on
you
asked
the
outraged

with
natural
wrath

a
beautiful
sight

bertie
with
solemnity
offered
on

you
and
you

good
enough
to

them
for
me
let
have
a
look
at
the
king
they
are
just
going
to
walk
him
cecil
complied
while
he
lounged
away
with
the
others
to
the
stables
with
a
face
of
the
most
calm
gentle
weary
indifference
in
the
world
the
thought
crossed
him
for
a
second
of
how
very
near
he
was
to
the
wind
the
figures
in
his
were
to
the
tune
of
several
thousands
one
way
or
another
if
he
won
this
morning
it
would
be
all
right
of
course
if
he
lost
even
beauty
odd
mixture
of
and
languor
though
he
was
felt
his
lips
grow
for
the
moment
hot
and
cold
by
turns
as
he
thought
of
that
possible
contingency
the
king
looked
in
splendid
condition
he
knew
well
enough
what
was
up
again
knew
what
was
meant
by
that
extra
sedulous
that
setting
muzzle
that
had
been
buckled
on
him
some
nights
previous
the
limitation
put
to
his
drink
the
careful
trial
spins
in
the
gray
of
the
mornings
the
conclusive
examination
of
his
plates
by
a
skillful
hand
he
knew
what
was
required
of
him
and
a
horse
in
nobler
condition
never
stepped
out
in
body
clothing
as
he
was
ridden
slowly
down
on
to
the
plains
of
iffesheim
the
austrian
dragoon
a
count
and
a
chamberlain
likewise
who
was
to
ride
his
only
possible
rival
the
french
horse
pulled
his
tawny
silken
mustaches
as
he
saw
the
great
english
hero
come
up
the
course
and
muttered
to
himself
est
was
a
brilliant
enough
bay
in
his
fashion
but
count
ruteroth
knew
the
measure
of
his
pace
and

too
thoroughly
to
expect
him
to
live
against
the

of

gray
my

wo
you

down

the

in

no

indeed
why
you

we

and
when

we
loses
as
if
we
liked
it
all
that
braying

show
what
he
can
do
over

lucky
for
him
then
that
he
has
got
you
across
the

him
i
believe
as
soon
as
look
at
him
if
it
was
made
worth
your
while
retorted
rake
in
caustic
wrath
his
science
of
repartee
chiefly
lay
in
a
successful
plant
and
he
was
here
uncomfortably
conscious
that
his
opponent
was
in
the
right
of
the
argument
as
he
started
through
the
throng
to
put
his
master
into
the
shell
of
the
scarlet
and
white
condition
my
boy
and
no
mistake
murmured
willon
for
the
edification
of
those
around
them
as
the
were
buckled
on
and
the
guards
crack
stood
the
cynosure
of
every
eye
at
iffesheim
then
in
his
capacity
as
head
attendant
on
the
hero
he
directed
the
exercise
bridle
to
be
taken
off
and
with
his
own
hands
adjusted
a
new
and
handsome
one
slung
across
his
arm
is
a
pity
is
a
pity
thought
the
worthy
as
he
put
the
curb
on
the
king
but
i
should
have
been
haggravated
with
that
hinsolent
soldiering
chap
there
my
boy
if
you
win
with
a
painted
quid
i
a
forest
king
champed
his
bit
between
his
teeth
a
little
it
tasted
bitter
he
tossed
his
head
and
licked
it
with
his
tongue
impatiently
the
taste
had
got
down
his
throat
and
he
did
not
like
its
flavor
he
turned
his
deep
lustrous
eyes
with
a
gentle
patience
on
the
crowd
about
him
as
though
asking
them
what
was
the
matter
with
him
no
one
moved
his
bit
the
only
person
who
could
have
had
such
authority
was
busily
giving
the
last
polish
to
his
coat
with
a
fine
handkerchief
that
glossy
neck
which
had
been
so
dusted
many
a
time
with
the
cobweb
handkerchiefs
of
great
ladies
and
his
instincts
glorious
as
they
were
were
not
wise
enough
to
tell
him
to
kick
his
head
groom
down
then
and
there
with
one
mortal
blow
as
his
poisoner
and
betrayer
the
king
chafed
under
the
taste
of
that
painted
quid
he
felt
a
nausea
as
he
swallowed
and
he
turned
his
handsome
head
with
a
strange
pathetic
astonishment
in
his
glance
at
that
moment
a
familiar
hand
stroked
his
mane
a
familiar
foot
was
put
into
his
stirrup
bertie
threw
himself
into
saddle
the
lightest
weight
that
ever
rode
despite
his
length
of
limb
the
king
at
the
touch
the
voice
pricked
his
delicate
ears
quivered
in
all
his
frame
with
eager
excitation
snuffed
the
air
restlessly
through
his
distended
nostrils
and
felt
every
vein
under
his
satin
skin
thrill
and
swell
with
pleasure
he
was
all
impatience
all
power
all
longing
vivid
intensity
of
life
if
only
that
nausea
would
go
he
felt
a
restless
sickliness
stealing
on
him
that
his
young
and
gallant
strength
had
never
known
since
he
was
foaled
but
it
was
not
in
the
king
to
yield
to
a
little
he
flung
his
head
up
champing
angrily
at
the
bit
then
walked
down
to
the
with
his
old
calm
collected
grace
and
cecil
looking
at
the
glossy
bow
of
the
neck
and
feeling
the
width
of
the
magnificent
ribs
beneath
him
stooped
from
his
saddle
a
second
as
he
rode
out
of
the
inclosure
and
bent
to
the
seraph
look
at
him
rock
the
thing
as
good
as
the
day
was
very
warm
and
brilliant
all
baden
had
come
down
to
the
continuous
strings
of
carriages
with
their
four
or
six
horses
and
postilions
held
the
line
far
down
over
the
plains
mob
there
was
none
save
of
women
in
matchless
toilets
and
men
with
the
highest
names
in
the
almanac
de
gotha
the
sun
shone
cloudlessly
on
the
broad
green
plateau
of
iffesheim
on
the
white
amphitheater
of
chalk
hills
and
on
the
glittering
silken
folds
of
the
flags
of
england
france
prussia
and
of
the
grand
duchy
itself
that
floated
from
the
summits
of
the
grand
stand
pavilion
and
jockey
club
the
ladies
descending
from
the
carriages
swept
up
and
down
on
the
green
course
that
was
so
free
from
cads
and
legs
their
magnificent
skirts
trailing
along
without
the
risk
of
a
grain
of
dust
their
costly
laces
side
by
side
with
the
austrian
uniforms
of
the
military
men
from
rastadt
the
betting
was
but
slight
in
odd
contrast
with
the
hubbub
and
striking
clamor
of
english
betting
rings
the
only
approach
to
anything
like
real
business
being
transacted
between
the
members
of
the
household
and
those
of
the
jockey
clubs
iffesheim
was
pure
pleasure
like
every
other
item
of
baden
existence
and
all
aristocratic
sparkling
rich
europe
seemed
gathered
there
under
the
sunny
skies
and
on
everyone
lips
in
the
titled
throng
was
but
one
name
forest
king
even
the
coquettish
who
remembered
the
dresses
of
his
own
colors
which
cecil
had
given
them
last
year
when
he
had
won
the
rastadt
would
sell
nothing
except
little
twin
scarlet
and
white
moss
rosebuds
of
which
thousands
were
gathered
and
died
that
morning
in
honor
of
the
english
guards
champion
a
slender
event
usually
the
presence
of
the
renowned
crack
of
the
household
cavalry
made
the
prix
de
dames
the
most
eagerly
entry
on
the
card
and
the
rest
of
the
field
were
scarcely
noticed
as
the
jacket
came
up
at
the
the
king
saw
that
blaze
of
light
and
color
over
course
and
stands
that
he
knew
so
well
by
this
time
he
felt
the
pressure
round
him
of
his
foreign
rivals
as
they
reared
and
pulled
and
fretted
and
passaged
the
old
longing
quivered
in
all
his
eager
limbs
the
old
fire
wakened
in
all
his
dauntless
blood
like
the
charger
at
sound
of
the
he
lived
in
his
past
victories
and
was
athirst
for
more
but
yet
between
him
and
the
sunny
morning
there
seemed
a
dim
hazy
screen
on
his
delicate
ear
the
familiar
clangor
smote
with
something
dulled
and
strange
there
seemed
a
numbness
stealing
down
his
frame
he
shook
his
head
in
an
unusual
and
irritated
impatience
he
did
not
know
what
ailed
him
the
hand
he
loved
so
loyally
told
him
the
work
that
was
wanted
of
him
but
he
felt
its
guidance
dully
too
and
the
dry
hard
hot
earth
as
he
struck
it
with
his
hoof
seemed
to
sway
and
heave
beneath
him
the
opiate
had
stolen
into
his
veins
and
was
creeping
stealthily
and
surely
to
the
sagacious
brain
and
over
the
clear
bright
senses
the
signal
for
the
start
was
given
the
first
mad
headlong
rush
broke
away
with
the
force
of
a
torrent
suddenly
loosened
every
instinct
of
race
and
custom
and
of
that
obedience
which
rendered
him
flexible
as
silk
to
his
rider
will
sent
him
forward
with
that
stride
which
made
the
guards
crack
a
household
word
in
all
the
shires
for
a
moment
he
shook
himself
clear
of
all
the
horses
and
led
off
in
the
old
grand
sweeping
canter
before
the
french
bay
three
lengths
in
the
one
single
effort
then
into
his
eyes
a
terrible
look
of
anguish
came
the
numb
and
sickly
nausea
was
upon
him
his
legs
trembled
before
his
sight
was
a
blurred
whirling
mist
all
the
strength
and
force
and
mighty
life
within
him
felt
ebbing
out
yet
he
struggled
bravely
he
strained
he
panted
he
heard
the
thundering
thud
of
the
first
flight
gaining
nearer
and
nearer
upon
him
he
felt
his
rivals
closing
hotter
and
harder
in
on
him
he
felt
the
steam
of
his
opponent
smoking
withers
burn
on
his
own
flanks
and
shoulders
he
felt
the
maddening
pressure
of
a
struggle
he
felt
what
in
all
his
victorious
life
he
had
never
known
the
paralysis
of
defeat
the
glittering
throngs
spreading
over
the
plains
gazed
at
him
in
the
sheer
stupor
of
amazement
they
saw
that
the
famous
english
hero
was
as
any
knacker
one
second
more
he
strove
to
wrench
himself
through
the
throng
of
the
horses
through
the
headlong
crushing
press
through
worst
foe
of
all
the
misty
darkness
curtaining
his
sight
one
second
more
he
tried
to
wrestle
back
the
old
life
into
his
limbs
the
unworn
power
and
freshness
into
nerve
and
sinew
then
the
darkness
fell
utterly
the
mighty
heart
failed
he
could
do
no
more
and
his
rider
hand
slackened
and
turned
him
gently
backward
his
rider
voice
sounded
very
low
and
quiet
to
those
who
seeing
that
every
effort
was
hopeless
surged
and
clustered
round
his
saddle
something
ails
the
king
said
cecil
calmly
he
is
fairly
knocked
off
his
legs
some
vet
must
look
to
him
ridden
a
yard
farther
he
will
words
so
gently
spoken
yet
in
the
single
minute
that
alone
had
passed
since
they
had
left
the
starter
chair
a
lifetime
seemed
to
have
been
centered
alike
to
forest
king
and
to
his
owner
the
field
swept
on
with
a
rush
without
the
favorite
and
the
prix
de
dames
was
won
by
the
french
bay
chapter
x
petite
when
a
young
prussian
had
shot
himself
the
night
before
for
roulette
losses
the
event
had
not
thrilled
startled
and
impressed
the
gay
baden
gathering
one
tithe
so
gravely
and
so
enduringly
as
did
now
the
unaccountable
failure
of
the
great
guards
crack
men
could
make
nothing
of
it
save
the
fact
that
there
was
something
dark
somewhere
the
painted
quid
had
done
its
work
more
thoroughly
than
willon
and
the
welsher
had
intended
they
had
meant
that
the
opiate
should
be
just
sufficient
to
make
the
favorite
off
his
speed
but
not
to
make
effects
so
palpable
as
these
it
was
however
so
deftly
prepared
that
under
examination
no
trace
could
be
found
of
it
and
the
result
of
veterinary
investigation
while
it
left
unremoved
the
conviction
that
the
horse
had
been
doctored
could
not
explain
when
or
how
or
by
what
medicines
forest
king
had
simply
broken
down
favorites
do
this
on
the
flat
and
over
the
furrow
from
an
overstrain
from
a
railway
journey
from
a
touch
of
cold
from
a
sudden
decay
of
power
from
spasm
or
from
vertigo
those
who
lose
by
them
may
think
what
they
will
of
roping
or
painting
or
nobbling
but
what
can
they
prove
even
in
the
great
scandals
that
come
before
the
autocrats
of
the
jockey
club
where
the
tampering
is
clearly
known
can
the
matter
ever
be
really
proved
and
sifted
very
rarely
the
trainer
affects
stolid
unconsciousness
or
unimpeachable
respectability
the
hapless
is
to
protest
innocence
and
ignorance
and
most
likely
protest
them
rightly
he
is
accused
dismissed
and
ruined
or
some
young
jock
has
a
caution
out
everywhere
against
him
and
never
again
can
get
a
mount
even
for
the
commonest
handicap
but
as
a
rule
the
real
criminals
are
never
unearthed
and
by
consequence
are
never
reached
and
punished
the
household
present
and
absent
were
heavily
hit
they
cared
little
for
the
crushers
they
incurred
but
their
champion
failure
when
he
was
in
the
face
of
europe
cut
them
more
terribly
the
fame
of
the
english
had
been
trusted
to
forest
king
and
his
owner
and
they
who
had
never
before
betrayed
the
trust
placed
in
them
had
broken
down
like
any
screw
out
of
a
livery
stable
like
any
jockey
bribed
to
pull
at
a
suburban
it
was
fearfully
bitter
work
and
unanimous
to
a
voice
the
indignant
murmur
of
doctored
ran
through
the
titled
fashionable
crowds
on
the
baden
course
in
deep
and
ominous
anger
the
seraph
grand
wrath
poured
out
fulminations
against
the
whosoever
he
was
or
wheresoever
he
lurked
and
threatened
with
a
vengeance
that
would
be
no
empty
words
the
direst
chastisement
of
the
club
of
which
both
his
father
and
himself
were
stewards
upon
the
unknown
criminal
the
austrian
and
french
nobles
while
winners
by
the
event
were
scarce
in
less
angered
excitement
it
seemed
to
cast
the
foulest
slur
upon
their
honor
that
upon
foreign
ground
the
renowned
english
should
have
been
tampered
with
thus
and
the
fair
ladies
of
either
world
added
the
influence
of
their
silver
tongues
and
were
eloquent
in
the
vivacity
of
their
sympathy
and
resentment
with
a
unanimity
women
rarely
show
in
savoring
defeat
but
usually
reserve
for
the
fairer
opportunity
of
swaying
the
censer
before
success
cecil
alone
amid
it
all
was
very
quiet
he
said
scarcely
a
word
nor
could
the
sharpest
watcher
have
detected
an
alteration
in
his
countenance
only
once
when
they
talked
around
him
of
the
investigations
of
the
club
and
of
the
institution
of
inquiries
to
discover
the
guilty
traitor
he
looked
up
with
a
sudden
dangerous
lighting
of
his
soft
dark
hazel
eyes
under
the
womanish
length
of
their
lashes
when
you
find
him
leave
him
to
the
light
was
gone
again
in
an
instant
but
those
who
knew
the
wild
strain
that
ran
in
the
royallieu
blood
knew
by
it
that
despite
his
gentle
temper
a
terrible
reckoning
for
the
evil
done
his
horse
might
come
some
day
from
the
quietist
he
said
little
or
nothing
else
and
to
the
sympathy
and
indignation
expressed
for
him
on
all
sides
he
answered
with
his
old
listless
calm
but
in
truth
he
barely
knew
what
was
saying
or
doing
about
him
he
felt
like
a
man
stunned
and
crushed
with
the
violence
of
some
tremendous
fall
the
excitation
the
agitation
the
angry
amazement
around
him
growing
as
near
clamor
as
was
possible
in
those
fashionable
so
free
from
roughs
and
almost
free
from
bookmakers
the
conflicting
opinions
clashing
here
and
there
even
indeed
the
graceful
condolence
of
the
brilliant
women
were
insupportable
to
him
he
longed
to
be
out
of
this
world
which
had
so
well
amused
him
he
longed
passionately
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
be
alone
for
he
knew
that
with
the
failure
of
forest
king
had
gone
the
last
plank
that
saved
him
from
ruin
perhaps
the
last
chance
that
stood
between
him
and
dishonor
he
had
never
looked
on
it
as
within
the
possibilities
of
hazard
that
the
horse
could
be
defeated
now
little
as
those
about
him
knew
it
an
absolute
and
irremediable
disgrace
fronted
him
for
secure
in
the
issue
of
the
prix
de
dames
and
compelled
to
weight
his
chances
in
it
very
heavily
that
his
winnings
might
be
wide
enough
to
relieve
some
of
the
upon
him
his
losses
now
were
great
and
he
knew
no
more
how
to
raise
the
moneys
to
meet
them
than
he
would
have
known
how
to
raise
the
dead
the
blow
fell
with
crushing
force
the
fiercer
because
his
indolence
had
persisted
in
ignoring
his
danger
and
because
his
whole
character
was
so
naturally
careless
and
so
habituated
to
ease
and
to
enjoyment
a
bitter
heartsick
misery
fell
on
him
the
tone
of
honor
was
high
with
him
he
might
be
reckless
of
everything
else
but
he
could
never
be
reckless
in
what
infringed
or
went
nigh
to
infringe
a
very
stringent
code
bertie
never
reasoned
in
that
way
he
simply
followed
the
instincts
of
his
breeding
without
analyzing
them
but
these
led
him
safely
and
surely
right
in
all
his
dealings
with
his
however
open
to
censure
his
life
might
be
in
other
matters
careless
as
he
was
and
indifferent
to
levity
in
many
things
his
ideas
of
honor
were
really
very
pure
and
elevated
he
suffered
proportionately
now
that
through
the
follies
of
his
own
imprudence
and
the
baseness
of
some
treachery
he
could
neither
sift
nor
avenge
he
saw
himself
driven
down
into
as
close
a
jeopardy
of
disgrace
as
ever
befell
a
man
who
did
not
willfully
and
out
of
guilty
coveting
of
its
fruits
seek
it
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
society
of
his
troops
of
acquaintance
became
intolerably
oppressive
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
sought
refuge
from
thought
in
the
stimulus
of
drink
and
dashed
down
neat
cognac
as
though
it
were
iced
badminton
as
he
drove
with
his
set
off
the
disastrous
plains
of
iffesheim
he
shook
himself
free
of
them
as
soon
as
he
could
he
felt
the
chatter
round
him
insupportable
the
men
were
thoroughly
and
though
they
were
sharply
hit
by
the
day
issue
never
even
by
implication
hinted
at
owing
the
disaster
to
their
faith
in
him
but
the
very
cordiality
and
sympathy
they
showed
cut
him
the
keenest
the
very
knowledge
of
their
forbearance
made
his
own
thoughts
darkest
far
worse
to
cecil
than
the
personal
destruction
the
day
calamity
brought
him
was
the
knowledge
of
the
entire
faith
these
men
had
placed
in
him
and
the
losses
which
his
own
mistaken
security
had
caused
them
granted
he
could
neither
guess
nor
avert
the
trickery
which
had
brought
about
his
failure
but
none
the
less
did
he
feel
that
he
had
failed
them
none
the
less
did
the
very
generosity
and
magnanimity
they
showed
him
sting
him
like
a
scourge
he
got
away
from
them
at
last
and
wandered
out
alone
into
the
gardens
of
the
stephanien
till
the
green
trees
of
an
alley
shut
him
in
in
solitude
and
the
only
echo
of
the
gay
world
of
baden
was
the
strain
of
a
band
the
light
mirth
of
a
laugh
or
the
roll
of
a
carriage
sounding
down
the
summer
air
it
was
eight
the
sun
was
slanting
in
the
west
in
a
cloudless
splendor
bathing
the
bright
scene
in
a
rich
golden
glow
and
tinging
to
bronze
the
dark
masses
of
the
black
forest
in
another
hour
he
was
the
expected
guest
of
a
russian
prince
at
a
dinner
party
where
all
that
was
highest
fairest
greatest
most
powerful
and
most
bewitching
of
every
nationality
represented
there
would
meet
and
in
the
midst
of
this
radiant
whirlpool
of
extravagance
and
pleasure
where
every
man
worth
owning
as
such
was
his
friend
and
every
woman
whose
smile
he
cared
for
welcomed
him
he
knew
himself
as
utterly
alone
as
utterly
doomed
as
the
lifeless
prussian
lying
in
the
no
aid
could
serve
him
for
it
would
have
been
but
to
sink
lower
yet
to
ask
or
to
take
it
no
power
could
save
him
from
the
ruin
which
in
a
few
days
later
at
the
farthest
would
mark
him
out
forever
an
exiled
beggared
perhaps
dishonored
man
a
debtor
and
an
alien
where
he
had
thrown
himself
on
a
bench
beneath
a
trying
vainly
to
realize
this
thing
which
had
come
upon
him
and
to
meet
which
not
training
nor
habit
nor
a
moment
grave
reflection
had
ever
done
the
slightest
to
prepare
him
gazing
blankly
and
unconsciously
at
the
dense
pine
woods
and
rugged
glens
of
the
forest
that
sloped
upward
and
around
above
the
green
and
leafy
nest
of
baden
he
watched
mechanically
the
toiling
passage
of
a
going
up
the
hillside
in
distance
through
the
firs
those
poor
devils
envy
us
he
thought
better
be
one
of
them
ten
thousand
times
than
be
trained
for
the
great
race
and
started
with
the
cracks
dead
weighted
with
the
of
poverty
a
soft
touch
came
on
his
arm
as
he
sat
there
he
looked
up
surprised
before
him
stood
a
dainty
delicate
little
form
all
gay
with
white
lace
and
broideries
and
rose
ribbons
and
floating
hair
fastened
backward
with
a
golden
fillet
it
was
that
of
the
little
lady
venetia
the
only
daughter
of
the
house
of
lyonnesse
by
a
late
marriage
of
his
grace
the
sister
of
the
colossal
seraph
the
plaything
of
a
young
and
lovely
mother
who
had
flirted
in
belgravia
with
her
future
stepson
before
she
fell
sincerely
and
veritably
in
love
with
the
gallant
and
still
handsome
duke
cecil
roused
himself
and
smiled
at
her
he
had
been
by
months
together
at
lyonnesse
most
years
of
the
child
life
and
had
been
gentle
to
her
as
he
was
to
every
living
thing
though
he
had
noticed
her
seldom
well
petite
reine
he
said
kindly
bitter
as
his
thoughts
were
calling
her
by
the
name
she
generally
bore
all
alone
where
are
your
playmates
petite
reine
who
to
justify
her
sobriquet
was
a
grand
imperial
little
lady
bent
her
delicate
head
a
very
delicate
head
indeed
carrying
itself
royally
young
though
it
was
ah
you
know
i
never
care
for
children
it
was
said
so
disdainfully
yet
so
sincerely
without
a
touch
of
affectation
and
so
genuinely
as
the
expression
of
a
matured
and
contemptuous
opinion
that
even
in
that
moment
it
amused
him
she
did
not
wait
an
answer
but
bent
nearer
with
an
infinite
pity
and
anxiety
in
her
pretty
eyes
i
want
to
know
you
are
so
vexed
are
you
not
they
say
you
have
lost
all
your
money
do
they
they
are
not
far
wrong
then
who
are
petite
reine
oh
prince
alexis
and
the
duc
de
lorance
and
mamma
and
everybody
is
it
true
very
true
my
little
ah
she
gave
a
long
sigh
looking
pathetically
at
him
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
her
lips
parted
i
heard
the
russian
gentleman
saying
that
you
were
ruined
is
that
true
too
yes
dear
he
answered
wearily
thinking
little
of
the
child
in
the
desperate
pass
to
which
his
life
had
come
petite
reine
stood
by
him
silent
her
proud
imperial
young
ladyship
had
a
very
tender
heart
and
she
was
very
sorry
she
had
understood
what
had
been
said
before
her
of
him
vaguely
indeed
and
with
no
sense
of
its
true
meaning
yet
still
with
the
quick
perception
of
a
brilliant
and
petted
child
looking
at
her
he
saw
with
astonishment
that
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
he
put
out
his
hand
and
drew
her
to
him
why
little
one
what
do
you
know
of
these
things
how
did
you
find
me
out
here
she
bent
nearer
to
him
swaying
her
slender
figure
with
its
bright
gossamer
muslins
like
a
dainty
and
lifting
her
face
to
his
earnest
beseeching
and
very
eager
i
came
i
came
please
do
be
angry
because
i
heard
them
say
you
had
no
money
and
i
want
you
to
take
mine
do
take
it
look
it
is
all
bright
gold
and
it
is
my
own

very
own
papa
gives
it
to
me
to
do
just
what
i
like
with
do
take
it
pray
do
coloring
deeply
for
the
petite
reine
had
that
true
instinct
of
generous
natures
a
most
sensitive
delicacy
for
others
but
growing
ardent
in
her
eloquence
and
imploring
in
her
entreaty
she
shook
on
to
knee
out
of
a
little
enamel
sweetmeat
box
twenty
bright
napoleons
that
fell
in
a
glittering
shower
on
the
grass
he
started
and
looked
at
her
in
a
silence
that
she
mistook
for
offense
she
leaned
nearer
pale
now
with
her
excitement
and
with
her
large
eyes
gleaming
and
melting
with
passionate
entreaty
do
be
angry
pray
take
it
it
is
all
my
own
and
you
know
i
have
bonbons
and
books
and
playthings
and
ponies
and
dogs
till
i
am
tired
of
them
i
never
want
the
money
indeed
i
do
take
it
please
take
it
and
if
you
will
only
let
me
ask
papa
or
rock
they
will
give
you
thousands
and
thousands
of
pounds
if
that
is
enough
do
let
me
cecil
in
silence
still
stooped
and
drew
her
to
him
when
he
spoke
his
voice
shook
ever
so
slightly
and
he
felt
his
eyes
dim
with
an
emotion
that
he
had
not
known
in
all
his
careless
life
the
child
words
and
action
touched
him
deeply
the
caressing
generous
innocence
of
the
offered
gift
beside
the
enormous
extravagance
and
hopeless
bankruptcy
of
his
career
smote
him
with
a
keen
pang
yet
moved
him
with
a
strange
pleasure
petite
reine
he
murmured
gently
striving
vainly
for
his
old
lightness
petite
reine
how
some
man
will
love
you
one
day
thank
you
from
my
heart
my
little
innocent
her
face
flushed
with
gladness
she
smiled
with
all
a
child
unshadowed
joy
ah
then
you
will
take
it
and
if
you
want
more
only
let
me
ask
them
for
it
papa
and
philip
never
refuse
me
anything
his
hand
wandered
gently
over
the
shower
of
her
hair
as
he
put
back
the
napoleons
that
he
had
gathered
up
into
her
azure
bonbonniere
petite
reine
you
are
a
little
angel
but
i
can
not
take
your
money
my
child
and
you
must
ask
for
none
for
my
sake
from
your
father
or
from
rock
do
not
look
so
grieved
little
one
i
love
you
none
the
less
because
i
refuse
petite
reine
face
was
very
pale
and
grave
a
delicate
face
in
its
miniature
feminine
childhood
almost
absurdly
like
the
seraph
her
eyes
were
full
of
plaintive
wonder
and
of
pathetic
reproach
ah
she
said
drooping
her
head
with
a
sigh
it
is
no
good
to
you
because
it
is
such
a
little
do
let
me
ask
for
more
he
smiled
but
the
smile
was
very
weary
no
dear
you
must
not
ask
for
more
i
have
been
very
foolish
my
little
friend
and
i
must
take
the
fruits
of
my
folly
all
men
must
i
can
accept
no
one
money
not
even
yours
when
you
are
older
and
remember
this
you
will
know
why
but
i
do
not
thank
you
the
less
from
my
she
looked
at
him
pained
and
wistful
you
will
not
take
anything
cecil
she
asked
with
a
sigh
glancing
at
her
rejected
napoleons
he
drew
the
enamel
bonbonniere
away
i
will
take
that
if
you
will
give
it
me
petite
reine
and
keep
it
in
memory
of
as
he
spoke
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
very
gently
the
act
had
moved
him
more
deeply
than
he
thought
he
had
it
in
him
to
be
moved
by
anything
and
the
child
face
turned
upward
to
him
was
of
a
very
perfect
and
aristocratic
loveliness
far
beyond
her
years
she
colored
as
his
lips
touched
hers
and
swayed
slightly
from
him
she
was
an
extremely
proud
young
sovereign
and
never
allowed
caresses
yet
she
lingered
by
him
troubled
grave
with
something
intensely
tender
and
pitiful
in
the
musing
look
of
her
eyes
she
had
a
perception
that
this
calamity
which
smote
him
was
one
far
beyond
the
ministering
of
her
knowledge
he
took
the
pretty
palais
royal
sweetmeat
box
and
slipped
it
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
it
was
only
a
child
gift
a
tiny
paris
toy
but
it
had
been
brought
to
him
in
a
tender
compassion
and
he
did
keep
it
kept
it
through
dark
days
and
wild
nights
through
the
scorch
of
the
desert
and
the
shadows
of
death
till
the
young
eyes
that
questioned
him
now
with
such
innocent
wonder
had
gained
the
grander
luster
of
their
womanhood
and
had
brought
him
a
grief
wider
than
he
knew
now
at
that
moment
as
the
child
stood
beside
him
under
the
drooping
acacia
boughs
with
the
green
sloping
lower
valley
seen
at
glimpses
through
the
wall
of
leaves
one
of
the
men
of
the
stephanien
approached
him
with
an
english
letter
which
as
it
was
marked
instant
they
had
laid
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
visitors
pile
of
correspondence
cecil
took
it
wearily
nothing
but
fresh
embarrassments
could
come
to
him
from
england
and
looked
at
the
little
lady
venetia
will
you
allow
me
she
bowed
her
graceful
head
with
all
the
naif
unconsciousness
of
a
child
she
had
all
the
manner
of
the
veille
cour
together
they
made
her
enchanting
he
broke
the
envelope
and
read
a
blurred
scrawled
miserable
letter
the
words
erased
with
passionate
strokes
and
blotted
with
hot
tears
and
scored
out
in
impulsive
misery
it
was
long
yet
at
a
glance
he
scanned
its
message
and
its
meaning
at
the
first
few
words
he
knew
its
whole
as
well
as
though
he
had
studied
every
line
a
strong
tremor
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
a
tremor
at
once
of
passionate
rage
and
of
as
passionate
pain
his
face
blanched
to
a
deadly
whiteness
his
teeth
clinched
as
though
he
were
restraining
some
bodily
suffering
and
he
tore
the
letter
in
two
and
stamped
it
down
into
the
turf
under
his
heel
with
a
gesture
as
unlike
his
common
serenity
of
manner
as
the
fiery
passion
that
darkened
in
his
eyes
was
unlike
the
habitual
softness
of
his
too
pliant
and
too
unresentful
temper
he
crushed
the
senseless
paper
again
and
again
down
into
the
grass
beneath
his
heel
his
lips
shook
under
the
silky
abundance
of
his
beard
the
natural
habit
of
long
usage
kept
him
from
all
utterance
and
even
in
the
violence
of
its
shock
he
remembered
the
young
venetia
presence
but
in
that
one
fierce
unrestrained
gesture
the
shame
and
suffering
upon
him
broke
out
despite
himself
the
child
watched
him
startled
and
awed
she
touched
his
hand
softly
what
is
it
is
it
anything
worse
he
turned
his
eyes
on
her
with
a
dry
hot
weary
anguish
in
them
he
was
scarcely
conscious
what
he
said
or
what
he
answered
worse
worse
he
repeated
mechanically
while
his
heel
still
ground
down
in
loathing
the
shattered
paper
into
the
grass
there
can
be
nothing
worse
it
is
the
vilest
blackest
he
spoke
to
his
thoughts
not
to
her
the
words
died
in
his
throat
a
bitter
agony
was
on
him
all
the
golden
summer
evening
all
the
fair
green
world
about
him
were
indistinct
and
unreal
to
his
senses
he
felt
as
if
the
whole
earth
were
of
a
sudden
changed
he
could
not
realize
that
this
thing
could
come
to
him
and
his
that
this
foul
dishonor
could
creep
up
and
stain
them
that
this
infamy
could
ever
be
of
them
and
upon
them
all
the
ruin
that
before
had
fallen
on
him
was
dwarfed
and
banished
it
looked
nothing
beside
the
unendurable
horror
that
reached
him
now
the
gay
laughter
of
children
sounded
down
the
air
at
that
moment
they
were
the
children
of
a
french
princess
seeking
their
playmate
venetia
who
had
escaped
from
them
and
from
their
games
to
find
her
way
to
cecil
he
motioned
her
to
them
he
could
not
bear
even
the
clear
and
pitying
eyes
of
the
petite
reine
to
be
upon
him
now
she
lingered
wistfully
she
did
not
like
to
leave
him
let
me
stay
with
you
she
pleaded
caressingly
you
are
vexed
at
something
i
can
not
help
you
but
rock
will
the
duke
will
do
let
me
ask
them
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
his
voice
as
he
answered
was
hoarse
and
unsteady
no
go
dear
you
will
please
me
best
by
leaving
me
ask
none
tell
none
i
can
trust
you
to
be
silent
petite
she
gave
him
a
long
earnest
look
yes
she
answered
simply
and
gravely
as
one
who
accepts
and
not
lightly
a
trust
then
she
went
slowly
and
lingeringly
with
the
sun
on
the
gold
fillet
binding
her
hair
but
the
tears
heavy
on
the
shadow
of
her
silken
lashes
when
next
they
met
again
the
luster
of
a
warmer
sun
that
once
burned
on
the
white
walls
of
the
palace
of
phoenicia
and
the
leaping
flame
of
the
temple
of
the
god
of
healing
shone
upon
them
and
through
the
veil
of
those
sweeping
lashes
there
gazed
the
resistless
sovereignty
of
a
proud
and
patrician
womanhood
alone
his
head
sank
down
upon
his
hands
he
gave
reins
to
the
fiery
scorn
the
acute
suffering
which
turn
by
turn
seized
him
with
every
moment
that
seared
the
words
of
the
letter
deeper
and
deeper
down
into
his
brain
until
this
he
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
suffer
until
this
his
languid
creeds
had
held
that
no
wise
man
feels
strongly
and
that
to
glide
through
life
untroubled
and
unmoved
is
as
possible
as
it
is
politic
now
he
suffered
he
suffered
dumbly
as
a
dog
passionately
as
a
barbarian
now
he
was
met
by
that
which
in
the
moment
of
its
dealing
pierced
his
panoplies
of
indifference
and
escaped
his
light
philosophies
oh
god
he
thought
if
it
were
anything
anything
except
disgrace
in
a
miserable
den
an
hour
or
so
before
there
are
miserable
dens
even
in
baden
that
rendezvous
of
princes
where
crowned
heads
are
numberless
as
couriers
and
great
ministers
must
sometimes
be
content
with
a
shakedown
two
men
sat
in
consultation
though
the
chamber
was
poor
and
dark
their
table
was
loaded
with
various
expensive
wines
and
liqueurs
of
a
truth
they
were
flush
of
money
and
selected
this
poor
place
from
motives
of
concealment
rather
than
of
necessity
one

heated
eager

with
triumph
and
glowing
with
a
gloating
malignity
excitement
and
the
fire
of
very
strong
wines
of
whose
vintage
brandy
formed
a
large
part
had
made
him
voluble
in
exultation
the
monosyllabic
sententiousness

had

him
in

been
dissipated

with

growled
afresh
draining
down
a
great
draught
of
roussillon
to
drown
the
impatient
conviction
which
possessed
him
that
let

triumph

would
ever
remain
in
that
fine
intangible
sense
which
his
coarse
nature
could

my
belief
they
let
it
off
on

there
ai
a
bit
of
evidence
to
show
the

doctored

the
way

off

against

if

you

you

respectable

laughed
softly
the

grimly
at
the
compliment
they
paid
the
church
baroni
put
up
his
papers
into
a
neat
russia
letter
book
excellently
dressed
without
a
touch
of
flashiness
he
did
look
eminently
respectable
and
lingered
a
moment
i

his

ben

took
his
legs
off
the
table
with
a
crash
and
stood
up
flushed
thirstily
eager
almost
aggressive
in
his
peremptory
excitement
without
wringing
my
dainty
bird
neck
not
for
a
million
paid
out
hand
without
crushing
my
fine
gentleman
down
into
powder
not
for
all
the
blunt
of
every
one
o
the
rothschilds
curse
his
woman
face
got
to
keep
dark
now
but
when
he
crushed
and
smashed
and
ruined
and
pilloried
and
drove
out
of
this
fine
world
and
warned
off
of
all
his
aristocratic
then
i
come
in
and
take
a
look
at
him
then
i
see
my
brilliant
gentleman
a
swindler
a
dying
in
the
bargain
the
intense
malignity
the
brutal
hungry
lust
for
vengeance
that
inspired
the
words
lent
their
coarse
vulgarity
something
that
was
for
the
moment
almost
tragical
in
its
strength
almost
horrible
in
its
passion
ezra
baroni
looked
at
him
quietly
then
without
another
word
went
out
to
a
congenial
task
dat
big
child
is
a
fool
mused
the
subtler
and
gentler
jew
vengeance
is
but
de
breath
of
de
vind
it
blow
for
you
one
day
it
blow
against
you
de
next
de
only
real
good
is
the
seraph
had
ridden
back
from
iffesheim
to
the
bad
in
company
with
some
austrian
officers
and
one
or
two
of
his
own
comrades
he
had
left
the
course
late
staying
to
exhaust
every
possible
means
of
inquiry
as
to
the
failure
of
forest
king
and
to
discuss
with
other
members
of
the
newmarket
and
foreign
jockey
clubs
the
best
methods
if
method
there
were
of
discovering
what
foul
play
had
been
on
foot
with
the
horse
that
there
was
some
and
very
foul
too
the
testimony
of
men
and
angels
would
not
have
dissuaded
the
seraph
and
the
event
had
left
him
most
unusually
grave
and
regretful
the
amount
he
had
lost
himself
in
consequence
was
of
not
the
slightest
moment
to
him
although
he
was
extravagant
enough
to
run
almost
to
the
end
even
of
his
own
princely
tether
in
money
matters
but
that
beauty
should
be
cut
down
was
more
vexatious
to
him
than
any
evil
accident
that
could
have
befallen
himself
and
he
guessed
pretty
nearly
the
terrible
influence
the
dead
failure
would
have
on
his
friend
position
true
he
had
never
heard
cecil
breathe
a
syllable
that
hinted
at
embarrassment
but
these
things
get
known
with
tolerable
accuracy
about
town
and
those
who
were
acquainted
as
most
people
in
their
set
were
with
the
impoverished
condition
of
the
royallieu
exchequer
however
hidden
it
might
be
under
an
unabated
magnificence
of
living
were
well
aware
also
that
none
of
the
old
viscount
sons
could
have
any
safe
resources
to
guarantee
them
from
as
rapid
a
ruin
as
they
liked
to
consummate
indeed
it
had
of
late
been
whispered
that
it
was
probable
despite
the
provisions
of
the
entail
that
all
the
green
wealth
and
norman
beauty
of
royallieu
itself
would
come
into
the
market
hence
the
seraph
the
and
most
of
men
was
worried
by
an
anxiety
and
a
despondency
which
he
would
never
have
indulged
most
assuredly
on
his
own
account
as
he
rode
away
from
iffesheim
after
the
defeat
of
his
corps
champion
he
was
expected
to
dinner
with
one
of
the
most
lovely
of
foreign
ambassadresses
and
was
to
go
with
her
afterward
to
the
vaudeville
at
the
pretty
golden
theater
where
a
troupe
from
the
bouffes
were
playing
but
he
felt
anything
but
in
the
mood
for
even
her
bewitching
and
in
an
marriageable
sense
safe
society
as
he
stopped
his
horse
at
his
own
hotel
the
badischer
hof
as
he
swung
himself
out
of
saddle
a
quiet
rather
handsome
little
man
drew
near
respectfully
lifting
his
hat
it
was
baroni
the
seraph
had
never
seen
the
man
in
his
life
that
he
knew
of
but
he
was
himself
naturally
frank
affable
courteous
and
never
given
to
hedging
himself
behind
the
pale
of
his
high
rank
provided
you
did
not
bore
him
you
might
always
get
access
to
him
easily
enough
the
duke
used
to
tell
him
too
easily
therefore
when
ezra
baroni
deferentially
approached
with
the
most
noble
the
marquis
of
rockingham
i
think
the
seraph
instead
of
leaving
the
stranger
there
discomfited
nodded
and
paused
with
his
inconsequent
good
nature
thinking
how
much
less
bosh
it
would
be
if
everybody
could
call
him
like
his
family
and
his
comrades
that
is
my
name
he
answered
i
do
not
know
you
do
you
want
anything
of
me
the
seraph
had
a
vivid
terror
of
people
who
wanted
him
in
the
subscription
not
the
police
sense
of
the
word
and
had
been
the
victim
of
frauds
innumerable
i
wished
returned
baroni
respectfully
but
with
sufficient
independence
to
conciliate
his
auditor
whom
he
saw
at
a
glance
cringing
subservience
would
disgust
to
have
the
opportunity
of
asking
your
lordship
a
very
simple
the
seraph
looked
a
little
bored
a
little
amused
well
ask
it
my
good
fellow
you
have
your
opportunity
he
said
impatiently
yet
still
then
would
you
my
lord
continued
the
jew
with
his
strong
accent
be
so
good
as
to
favor
me
by
saying
whether
this
signature
be
your
own
the
jew
held
before
him
a
folded
paper
so
folded
that
one
line
only
was
visible
across
which
was
dashed
in
bold
characters
the
seraph
put
up
his
stopped
and
took
a
steadfast
look
then
shook
his
head
no
that
is
not
mine
at
least
i
think
not
never
made
my
r
half
a
quarter
so
well
in
my
many
thanks
my
lord
said
baroni
quietly
one
question
more
and
we
can
substantiate
the
fact
did
your
lordship
indorse
any
bill
on
the
of
last
month
the
seraph
looked
surprised
and
reflected
a
moment
no
i
did
he
said
after
a
pause
i
have
done
it
for
men
but
not
on
that
day
i
was
shooting
at
hornsey
wood
most
of
it
if
i
remember
right
why
do
you
ask
i
will
tell
you
my
lord
if
you
grant
me
a
private
the
seraph
moved
away
never
do
that
he
said
briefly
private
interviews
thought
he
acting
on
past
experience
with
women
always
mean
proposals
and
with
men
always
mean
baroni
made
a
quick
movement
toward
him
an
instant
my
lord
this
intimately
concerns
yourself
the
steps
of
an
hotel
are
surely
not
the
place
in
which
to
speak
of
it
i
wish
to
hear
nothing
about
it
replied
rock
putting
him
aside
while
he
thought
to
himself
regretfully
that
is
that
bit
of
paper
perhaps
some
poor
wretch
is
in
a
scrape
i
wish
i
had
so
wholly
denied
my
signature
if
the
mischief
done
there
no
good
in
bothering
the
the
seraph
good
nature
was
apt
to
overlook
such
trifles
as
the
law
baroni
kept
pace
with
him
as
he
approached
the
hotel
door
and
spoke
very
low
my
lord
if
you
do
not
listen
worse
may
befall
the
reputation
both
of
your
regiment
and
your
the
seraph
swung
round
his
careless
handsome
face
set
stern
in
an
instant
his
blue
eyes
grave
and
gathering
an
ominous
fire
step
yonder
he
said
curtly
signing
the
hebrew
toward
the
grand
staircase
show
that
person
to
my
rooms
but
for
the
publicity
of
the
entrance
of
the
badischer
hof
the
mighty
right
arm
of
the
guardsman
might
have
terminated
the
interview
then
and
there
in
different
fashion
baroni
had
gained
his
point
and
was
ushered
into
the
fine
chambers
set
apart
for
the
future
duke
of
lyonnesse
the
seraph
strode
after
him
and
as
the
attendant
closed
the
door
and
left
them
alone
in
the
first
of
the
great
lofty
suite
all
glittering
with
gilding
and
ormolu
and
malachite
and
rose
velvet
and
parisian
taste
stood
like
a
tower
above
the
jew
small
slight
form
while
his
words
came
curtly
and
only
by
a
fierce
effort
through
his
lips
substantiate
what
you
dare
to
say
or
my
grooms
shall
throw
you
out
of
that
window
now
baroni
looked
up
unmoved
the
calm
steady
undisturbed
glance
sent
a
chill
over
the
seraph
he
thought
if
this
man
came
but
for
purposes
of
extortion
and
were
not
fully
sure
that
he
could
make
good
what
he
said
this
was
not
the
look
he
would
give
i
desire
nothing
better
my
lord
said
baroni
quietly
though
i
greatly
regret
to
be
the
messenger
of
such
an
errand
this
bill
which
in
a
moment
i
will
have
the
honor
of
showing
you
was
transacted
by
my
house
i
am
one
of
the
partners
of
a
london
discounting
firm
indorsed
thus
by
your
celebrated
name
moneys
were
lent
on
it
the
bill
was
made
payable
at
two
months
date
it
was
understood
that
you
accepted
it
there
could
be
no
risk
with
such
a
signature
as
yours
the
bill
was
negotiated
i
was
in
leyden
lubeck
and
other
places
at
the
period
i
heard
nothing
of
the
matter
when
i
returned
to
london
a
little
less
than
a
week
ago
i
saw
the
signature
for
the
first
time
i
was
at
once
aware
that
it
was
not
yours
for
i
had
some
paid
bills
signed
by
you
at
hand
with
which
i
compared
it
of
course
my
only
remedy
was
to
seek
you
out
although
i
was
nearly
certain
before
your
present
denial
that
the
bill
was
a
he
spoke
quite
tranquilly
still
with
a
perfectly
respectful
regret
but
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
his
title
to
be
heard
and
is
acting
simply
in
hie
own
clear
right
the
seraph
listened
restless
impatient
sorely
tried
to
keep
in
the
passion
which
had
been
awakened
by
the
hint
that
this
wretched
matter
could
concern
or
attaint
the
honor
of
his
corps
well
speak
out
he
said
impatiently
details
are
nothing
who
drew
it
who
forged
my
name
if
it
be
forged
quick
give
me
the
with
every
trust
and
every
deference
my
lord
i
can
not
let
the
bill
pass
out
of
my
own
hands
until
this
unfortunate
matter
be
cleared
up
if
cleared
up
it
can
be
your
lordship
shall
see
the
bill
however
of
course
spread
here
upon
the
table
but
first
let
me
warn
you
my
lord
marquis
that
the
sight
will
be
intensely
painful
to
you
very
painful
my
lord
added
baroni
impressively
prepare
yourself
for
rock
dashed
his
hand
down
on
the
marble
table
with
a
force
that
made
the
lusters
and
statuettes
on
it
ring
and
tremble
no
more
words
lay
the
bill
baroni
bowed
and
smoothed
out
upon
the
console
the
crumpled
document
holding
it
with
one
hand
yet
leaving
visible
with
the
counterfeited
signature
one
other
the
name
of
the
forger
in
whose
favor
the
bill
was
drawn
that
other
signature
was
bertie
i
deeply
regret
to
deal
you
such
a
blow
from
such
a
friend
my
lord
said
the
jew
softly
the
seraph
stooped
and
gazed
one
instant
of
horrified
amazement
kept
him
dumb
there
staring
at
the
written
paper
as
at
some
ghastly
thing
then
all
the
hot
blood
rushed
over
his
fair
bold
face
he
flung
himself
on
the
hebrew
and
ere
the
other
could
have
breath
or
warning
tossed
him
upward
to
the
painted
ceiling
and
hurled
him
down
again
upon
the
velvet
carpet
as
lightly
as
a
retriever
will
catch
up
and
let
fall
a
wild
duck
or
a
grouse
and
stood
over
baroni
where
he
lay
you
hound
baroni
lying
passive
and
breathless
with
the
violence
of
the
shock
and
the
surprise
yet
kept
even
amid
the
hurricane
of
wrath
that
had
tossed
him
upward
and
downward
as
the
winds
toss
leaves
his
hold
upon
the
document
and
his
clear
cool
ready
my
lord
he
said
faintly
i
do
not
wonder
at
your
excitement
aggressive
as
it
renders
you
but
i
can
not
admit
that
false
which
i
know
to
be
a
for
silence
say
that
word
once
more
and
i
shall
forget
myself
and
hurl
you
out
into
the
street
like
the
dog
of
a
jew
you
are
have
patience
an
instant
my
lord
will
it
profit
your
friend
and
if
it
be
afterward
said
that
when
this
charge
was
brought
against
him
you
my
lord
rockingham
had
so
little
faith
in
his
power
to
refute
it
that
you
bore
down
with
all
your
mighty
strength
in
a
personal
assault
upon
one
so
weakly
as
myself
and
sought
to
put
an
end
to
the
evidence
against
him
by
bodily
threats
against
my
safety
and
by
what
will
look
legally
my
lord
like
an
attempt
to
coerce
me
into
silence
and
to
obtain
the
paper
from
my
hands
by
violence
faint
and
hoarse
the
words
were
but
they
were
spoken
with
quiet
confidence
with
admirable
acumen
they
were
the
very
words
to
lash
the
passions
of
his
listener
into
unendurable
fire
yet
to
chain
them
powerless
down
the
guardsman
stood
above
him
his
features
flushed
and
dark
with
rage
his
eyes
literally
blazing
with
fury
his
lips
working
under
his
tawny
leonine
beard
at
every
syllable
he
could
have
thrown
himself
afresh
upon
the
jew
and
flung
him
out
of
his
presence
as
so
much
carrion
yet
the
impotence
that
truth
so
often
feels
caught
and
meshed
in
the
coils
of
subtlety
the
desperate
disadvantage
at
which
right
is
so
often
placed
when
met
by
the
cunning
science
and
sophistry
of
wrong
held
the
seraph
in
their
net
now
he
saw
his
own
rashness
he
saw
how
his
actions
could
be
construed
till
they
cast
a
slur
even
on
the
man
he
defended
he
saw
how
legally
he
was
in
error
how
legally
the
gallant
vengeance
of
an
indignant
friendship
might
be
construed
into
consciousness
of
guilt
in
the
accused
for
whose
sake
the
vengeance
fell
he
stood
silent
overwhelmed
with
the
intensity
of
his
own
passion
baffled
by
the
ingenuity
of
a
he
could
not
refute
ezra
baroni
saw
his
advantage
he
ventured
to
raise
himself
slightly
my
lord
since
your
faith
in
your
friend
is
so
perfect
send
for
him
if
he
be
innocent
and
i
a
liar
with
a
look
i
shall
be
the
tone
was
perfectly
impassive
but
the
words
expressed
a
world
for
a
moment
the
seraph
eyes
flashed
on
him
with
a
look
that
made
him
feel
nearer
his
death
than
he
had
been
near
to
it
in
all
his
days
but
rockingham
restrained
himself
from
force
i
will
send
for
him
he
said
briefly
in
that
answer
there
was
more
of
menace
and
of
meaning
than
in
any
physical
action
he
moved
and
let
baroni
rise
shaken
and
bruised
but
otherwise
little
seriously
hurt
and
still
holding
in
a
tenacious
grasp
the
crumpled
paper
he
rang
his
own
servant
answered
the
summons
go
to
the
stephanien
and
inquire
for
cecil
be
quick
and
request
him
wherever
he
be
to
be
so
good
as
to
come
to
me
instantly
the
servant
bowed
and
withdrew
a
perfect
silence
followed
between
these
two
so
strangely
assorted
companions
the
seraph
stood
with
his
back
against
the
mantelpiece
with
every
sense
on
the
watch
to
catch
every
movement
of
the
jew
and
to
hear
the
first
sound
of
cecil
approach
the
minutes
dragged
on
the
seraph
was
in
an
agony
of
probation
and
impatience
once
the
attendants
entered
to
light
the
chandeliers
and
candelabra
the
full
light
fell
on
the
dark
slight
form
of
the
hebrew
and
on
the
superb
attitude
and
the
fair
frank
proud
face
of
the
standing
guardsman
neither
moved
once
more
they
were
left
alone
the
moments
ticked
slowly
away
one
by
one
audible
in
the
silence
now
and
then
the
quarter
chimed
from
the
clock
it
was
the
only
sound
in
the
chamber
chapter
xi
for
a
woman
sake
the
door
opened
cecil
entered
the
seraph
crossed
the
room
with
his
hand
held
out
not
for
his
life
in
that
moment
would
he
have
omitted
that
gesture
of
friendship
involuntarily
he
started
and
stood
still
one
instant
in
amaze
the
next
he
flung
thought
away
and
dashed
into
swift
inconsequent
words
cecil
my
dear
fellow
i
ashamed
to
send
for
you
on
such
a
blackguard
errand
never
heard
of
such
a
swindler
trick
in
all
my
life
pitch
the
fellow
into
the
street
because
of
the
look
of
the
thing
and
ca
take
any
other
measure
without
you
you
know
i
only
sent
for
you
to
expose
the
whole
abominable
business
never
because
i
believe
hang
it
beauty
i
ca
bring
myself
to
say
it
even
if
a
sound
thrashing
would
have
settled
the
matter
i
would
have
bothered
you
about
it
nor
told
you
a
syllable
only
you
are
sure
bertie
are
you
that
i
never
listened
to
this
miserable
outrage
on
us
both
with
a
thought
there
could
be
truth
in
it
you
know
me
you
trust
me
too
well
not
to
be
certain
of
that
the
incoherent
address
poured
out
from
his
lips
in
a
breathless
torrent
he
had
never
been
so
excited
in
his
life
and
he
pleaded
with
as
imploring
an
earnestness
as
though
he
had
been
the
suspected
criminal
not
to
be
accused
with
having
one
shadow
of
shameful
doubt
against
his
friend
his
words
would
have
told
nothing
except
bewilderment
to
one
who
should
have
been
a
stranger
to
the
subject
on
which
he
spoke
yet
cecil
never
asked
even
what
he
meant
there
was
no
surprise
upon
his
face
no
flush
of
anger
no
expression
of
amaze
or
indignation
only
the
look
which
had
paralyzed
rock
on
his
entrance
he
stood
still
and
mute
the
seraph
looked
at
him
a
great
dread
seizing
him
lest
he
should
have
seemed
himself
to
cast
this
foul
thing
on
his
and
in
that
dread
all
the
fierce
fire
of
his
passion
broke
its
bounds
damnation
cecil
ca
you
hear
me
a
hound
has
brought
against
you
the
vilest
charge
that
ever
swindlers
framed
an
infamy
that
he
deserves
to
be
shot
for
as
if
he
were
a
dog
he
makes
me
stand
before
you
as
if
i
were
your
accuser
as
if
i
doubted
you
as
if
i
lent
an
ear
one
second
to
this
loathsome
lie
i
sent
for
you
to
confront
him
and
to
give
him
up
to
the
law
stand
out
you
scoundrel
and
let
us
see
how
you
dare
look
at
us
now
he
swung
round
at
the
last
words
and
signed
to
baroni
to
rise
from
the
couch
were
he
sat
the
jew
advanced
slowly
softly
if
your
lordship
will
pardon
me
you
have
scarcely
made
it
apparent
what
the
matter
is
for
which
the
gentleman
is
wanted
you
have
scarcely
explained
to
him
that
it
is
on
a
charge
of
the
seraph
eyes
flashed
on
him
with
a
light
like
a
lion
and
his
right
hand
clinched
hard
by
my
life
if
you
say
that
word
again
you
shall
be
flung
in
the
street
like
the
cur
you
are
let
me
pay
what
i
will
for
it
cecil
why
you
speak
bertie
had
not
moved
not
a
breath
escaped
his
lips
he
stood
like
a
statue
deadly
pale
in
the
gaslight
when
the
figure
of
baroni
rose
up
and
came
before
him
a
great
darkness
stole
on
his
face
it
was
a
terrible
bitterness
a
great
horror
a
loathing
disgust
but
it
was
scarcely
criminality
and
it
was
not
fear
still
he
stood
perfectly
silent
a
guilty
man
any
other
than
his
loyal
friend
would
have
said
guilty
and
confronted
with
a
just
accuser
the
seraph
saw
that
look
and
a
deadly
chill
passed
over
him
as
it
had
done
at
the
jew
first
charge
not
doubt
such
heresy
to
his
creeds
such
shame
to
his
comrade
and
his
corps
could
not
be
in
him
but
a
vague
dread
hushed
his
impetuous
vehemence
the
dignity
of
the
old
lyonnesse
blood
asserted
its
ascendency
m
baroni
make
your
statement
later
on
cecil
can
avenge
cecil
never
moved
once
his
eyes
went
to
rockingham
with
a
look
of
yearning
grateful
unendurable
pain
but
it
was
repressed
instantly
a
perfect
passiveness
was
on
him
the
jew
smiled
my
statement
is
easily
made
and
will
not
be
so
new
to
this
gentleman
as
it
was
to
your
lordship
i
simply
charge
the
honorable
bertie
cecil
with
having
negotiated
a
bill
with
my
firm
for
pounds
on
the
of
last
month
drawn
in
his
own
favor
and
accepted
at
two
months
date
by
your
lordship
your
signature
you
my
lord
marquis
admit
to
be
a
forgery
with
that
forgery
i
charge
your
friend
the
the
echo
of
those
words
alone
escaped
the
dry
white
lips
of
cecil
he
showed
no
amaze
no
indignation
once
only
as
the
charge
was
made
he
gave
in
sudden
gesture
with
a
sudden
gleam
so
dark
so
dangerous
in
his
eyes
that
his
comrade
thought
and
hoped
that
with
one
moment
more
the
jew
would
be
dashed
down
at
his
feet
with
the
lie
branded
on
his
mouth
by
the
fiery
blow
of
a
slandered
and
outraged
honor
the
action
was
repressed
the
extraordinary
quiescence
more
hopeless
because
more
resigned
than
any
sign
of
pain
or
of
passion
returned
either
by
force
of
or
by
the
stupor
of
despair
the
seraph
gazed
at
him
with
a
fixed
astounded
horror
he
could
not
believe
his
senses
he
could
not
realize
what
he
saw
his
dearest
friend
stood
mute
beneath
the
charge
of
lowest
villainy
stood
powerless
before
the
falsehoods
of
a
jew
extortioner
bertie
great
heaven
he
cried
beside
himself
how
can
you
stand
silent
there
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
aright
do
you
know
the
accursed
thing
this
conspiracy
has
tried
to
charge
you
with
say
something
for
the
love
of
god
i
will
have
vengeance
on
your
slanderer
if
you
take
he
had
looked
for
the
rise
of
the
same
passion
that
rang
in
his
own
imperious
words
for
the
fearless
wrath
of
an
insulted
gentleman
the
instantaneous
outburst
of
a
contemptuous
denial
the
fire
of
scorn
the
lightning
flash
of
fury
all
that
he
gave
himself
all
that
must
be
so
naturally
given
by
a
slandered
man
under
the
libel
that
brands
him
with
disgrace
he
had
looked
for
these
as
surely
as
he
looked
for
the
setting
of
one
sun
and
the
rise
of
another
he
would
have
staked
his
life
on
the
course
of
his
friend
conduct
as
he
would
upon
his
own
and
a
ghastly
terror
sent
a
pang
to
his
heart
still
cecil
stood
silent
there
was
a
strange
set
repressed
anguish
on
his
face
that
made
it
chill
as
stone
there
was
an
unnatural
calm
upon
him
yet
he
lifted
his
head
with
a
gesture
haughty
for
the
moment
as
any
action
that
his
defender
could
have
wished
i
am
not
guilty
he
said
simply
the
seraph
hands
were
on
his
own
in
a
close
eager
grasp
almost
ere
the
words
were
spoken
beauty
beauty
never
say
that
to
me
do
you
think
i
can
ever
doubt
you
for
a
moment
cecil
head
sank
the
dignity
with
which
he
had
spoken
remained
on
him
but
the
scorn
of
his
defiance
and
his
denial
faded
no
you
can
not
you
never
the
words
were
spoken
almost
mechanically
like
a
man
in
a
dream
ezra
baroni
standing
calmly
there
with
the
tranquility
that
an
assured
power
alone
confers
smiled
slightly
once
more
you
are
not
guilty
cecil
i
shall
be
charmed
if
we
can
find
it
so
your
proofs
proof
i
give
you
my
baroni
bowed
with
a
sneer
at
once
insolent
but
subdued
we
men
of
business
sir
are
perhaps
inconveniently
for
gentlemen
given
to
a
preference
in
favor
of
something
more
substantial
your
word
doubtless
is
your
bond
among
your
acquaintance
it
is
a
pity
for
you
that
your
friend
name
should
have
been
added
to
the
bond
you
placed
with
us
business
men
pertinacity
is
a
little
wearisome
no
doubt
to
officers
and
members
of
the
aristocracy
like
yourself
but
all
the
same
i
must
persist
how
can
you
disprove
this
charge
the
seraph
turned
on
him
with
a
fierceness
of
a
bloodhound
you
dog
if
you
use
that
tone
again
in
my
presence
i
will
you
till
you
can
not
breathe
baroni
laughed
a
little
he
felt
secure
now
and
could
not
resist
the
pleasure
of
braving
and
of
torturing
the
i
do
doubt
your
will
or
your
strength
my
lord
but
neither
do
i
doubt
the
force
of
the
law
to
make
you
account
for
any
brutality
of
the
your
lordship
may
please
to
exert
on
the
seraph
ground
his
heel
into
the
carpet
we
waste
words
on
that
wretch
he
said
abruptly
to
cecil
prove
his
insolence
the
lie
it
is
and
we
will
deal
with
him
later
precisely
what
i
said
my
lord
murmured
baroni
let
cecil
prove
his
into
bertie
eyes
came
a
hunted
driven
desperation
he
turned
them
on
rockingham
with
a
look
that
cut
him
to
the
heart
yet
the
abhorrent
thought
crossed
him
was
it
thus
that
men
guiltless
looked
mr
cecil
was
with
my
partner
at
on
the
evening
of
the
it
was
long
over
business
hours
but
my
partner
to
oblige
him
stretched
a
point
pursued
the
soft
bland
malicious
voice
of
the
german
jew
if
he
was
not
at
our
office
where
was
he
that
is
simple
answered
in
a
moment
said
the
seraph
with
impetuous
certainty
cecil
to
prove
this
man
what
he
is
not
for
an
instant
to
satisfy
me
where
were
you
at
that
time
on
the
the
where
were
you
pursued
his
friend
were
you
at
mess
at
the
clubs
dressing
for
dinner
where
where
there
must
be
thousands
of
ways
of
remembering
thousands
of
people
who
prove
it
for
you
cecil
stood
mute
still
his
teeth
clinched
on
his
under
lip
he
could
not
speak
a
woman
reputation
lay
in
his
silence
ca
you
remember
implored
the
seraph
you
will
think
you
must
think
there
was
a
feverish
entreaty
in
his
voice
that
hunted
helplessness
with
which
a
question
so
slight
yet
so
momentous
was
received
was
forcing
in
on
him
a
thought
that
he
flung
away
like
an
asp
cecil
looked
both
of
them
full
in
the
eyes
both
his
accuser
and
his
friend
he
was
held
as
speechless
as
though
his
tongue
were
paralyzed
he
was
bound
by
his
word
of
honor
he
was
weighted
with
a
secret
do
look
at
me
so
bertie
for
mercy
sake
speak
where
were
you
i
can
not
tell
you
but
i
was
not
the
words
were
calm
there
was
a
great
resolve
in
them
moreover
but
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
his
lips
shook
he
paid
a
bitter
price
for
the
butterfly
pleasure
of
a
love
can
not
tell
me
can
not
you
mean
you
have
forgotten
i
can
not
tell
you
it
is
there
was
an
almost
fierce
and
sullen
desperation
in
the
answer
its
firmness
was
not
shaken
but
the
ordeal
was
terrible
a
reputation
a
thing
so
lightly
thrown
away
with
an
idler
word
a
lovelace
smile
that
was
all
he
had
to
sacrifice
to
clear
himself
from
the
toils
gathering
around
him
that
was
all
and
his
word
of
honor
baroni
bent
his
head
with
an
ironic
mockery
of
sympathy
i
feared
so
my
lord
cecil
can
not
tell
as
it
happens
my
partner
can
tell
cecil
was
with
him
at
the
hour
and
on
the
day
i
specify
and
cecil
transacted
with
him
the
bill
that
i
have
had
the
honor
of
showing
you
let
me
see
the
request
was
peremptory
to
imperiousness
yet
cecil
would
have
faced
his
death
far
sooner
than
he
would
have
looked
upon
that
piece
of
paper
baroni
smiled
it
is
not
often
that
we
treat
gentlemen
under
misfortune
in
the
manner
we
treat
you
sir
they
are
usually
dealt
with
more
summarily
less
mercifully
you
must
excuse
altogether
my
showing
you
the
document
both
you
and
his
lordship
are
officers
skilled
i
believe
in
the
patrician
science
of
he
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
and
the
rarity
of
insolence
to
the
men
before
him
so
far
above
him
in
social
rank
yet
at
that
juncture
so
utterly
at
his
mercy
you
mean
that
we
should
fall
foul
of
you
and
seize
it
thundered
rockingham
in
the
magnificence
of
his
wrath
do
you
judge
the
world
by
your
own
wretched
villainies
let
him
see
the
paper
lay
it
there
or
as
there
is
truth
on
earth
i
will
kill
you
where
you
the
jew
quailed
under
the
fierce
flashing
of
those
leonine
eyes
he
bowed
with
that
tact
which
never
forsook
him
i
confide
it
to
your
honor
my
lord
marquis
he
said
as
he
spread
out
the
bill
on
the
console
he
was
an
able
diplomatist
cecil
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
the
signatures
dashed
across
the
paper
both
who
saw
him
saw
also
the
shiver
like
a
shiver
of
intense
cold
that
ran
through
him
as
he
did
so
and
saw
his
teeth
clinch
tight
in
the
extremity
of
rage
in
the
excess
of
pain
or
to
hold
in
all
utterance
that
might
be
on
his
lips
well
asked
the
seraph
in
a
breathless
anxiety
he
knew
not
what
to
believe
what
to
do
whom
to
accuse
of
or
how
to
unravel
this
mystery
of
villainy
and
darkness
but
he
felt
with
a
sickening
reluctance
which
drove
him
wild
that
his
friend
did
not
act
in
this
thing
as
he
should
have
acted
not
as
men
of
assured
innocence
and
secure
honor
act
beneath
such
a
charge
cecil
was
unlike
himself
unlike
every
deed
and
word
of
his
life
unlike
every
thought
of
the
seraph
fearless
expectance
when
he
had
looked
for
the
coming
of
the
accused
as
the
signal
for
the
sure
and
instant
unmasking
condemnation
and
chastisement
of
the
false
accuser
do
you
still
persist
in
denying
your
criminality
in
the
face
of
that
bill
cecil
asked
the
bland
sneering
courteous
voice
of
ezra
baroni
i
do
i
never
wrote
either
of
these
signatures
i
never
saw
that
document
until
the
answer
was
firmly
given
the
old
blaze
of
scorn
came
again
in
his
weary
eyes
and
his
regard
met
calmly
and
unflinchingly
the
looks
fastened
on
him
but
the
nerves
of
his
lips
twitched
his
face
was
haggard
as
by
a
night
deep
gambling
there
was
a
heavy
dew
on
his
forehead
it
was
not
the
face
of
a
wholly
guiltless
of
a
wholly
unconscious
man
often
even
as
innocence
may
be
unwittingly
betrayed
into
what
wears
the
semblance
of
and
yet
you
equally
persist
in
refusing
to
account
for
your
occupation
of
the
early
evening
hours
of
the
unfortunate
i
do
but
in
your
account
of
them
you
lie
there
was
a
sternness
inflexible
as
steel
in
the
brief
sentence
under
it
for
an
instant
though
not
visibly
baroni
flinched
and
a
fear
of
the
man
he
accused
smote
him
more
deep
more
keen
than
that
with
which
the
sweeping
might
of
the
seraph
fury
had
moved
him
he
knew
now
why
ben
davis
had
hated
with
so
deadly
a
hatred
the
latent
strength
that
slept
under
the
quietist
languor
and
nonchalance
of
the
d
d
what
he
felt
however
did
not
escape
him
by
the
slightest
sign
as
a
matter
of
course
you
deny
it
he
said
with
a
polite
wave
of
his
hand
quite
right
you
are
not
required
to
criminate
yourself
i
wish
sincerely
we
were
not
compelled
to
criminate
the
seraph
grand
rolling
voice
broke
in
he
had
stood
chafing
chained
panting
in
agonies
of
passion
and
of
misery
m
baroni
he
said
hotly
the
furious
vehemence
of
his
anger
and
his
bewilderment
obscuring
in
him
all
memory
of
either
law
or
fact
you
have
heard
his
signature
and
your
statements
alike
denied
once
for
all
by
cecil
your
document
is
a
libel
and
a
conspiracy
like
your
charge
it
is
false
and
you
are
swindling
it
is
an
outrage
and
you
are
a
scoundrel
you
have
schemed
this
infamy
for
the
sake
of
extortion
not
a
sovereign
will
you
obtain
through
it
were
the
accusation
you
dare
to
make
true
i
am
the
only
one
whom
it
can
concern
since
it
is
my
name
which
is
involved
were
it
true
could
it
possibly
be
true
i
should
forbid
any
steps
to
be
taken
in
it
i
should
desire
it
ended
once
and
forever
it
shall
be
so
now
by
god
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
yet
what
he
did
say
utterly
as
it
defied
all
checks
of
law
or
circumstance
had
so
gallant
a
ring
had
so
kingly
a
wrath
that
it
awed
and
impressed
even
baroni
in
the
instant
of
its
utterance
they
say
that
those
fine
gentlemen
fight
like
a
thousand
lions
when
they
are
once
roused
he
thought
i
can
believe
my
lord
he
said
softly
you
have
called
me
by
many
epithets
and
menaced
me
with
many
threats
since
i
have
entered
this
chamber
it
is
not
a
wise
thing
to
do
with
a
man
who
knows
the
law
however
i
can
allow
for
the
heat
of
your
excitement
as
regards
the
rest
of
your
speech
you
will
permit
me
to
say
that
its
wildness
of
language
is
only
equaled
by
the
utter
irrationality
of
your
deductions
and
your
absolute
ignorance
of
all
legalities
were
you
alone
concerned
and
alone
the
discoverer
of
this
fraud
you
could
prosecute
or
not
as
you
please
but
we
are
subjects
of
its
imposition
ours
is
the
money
that
he
has
obtained
by
that
forgery
and
we
shall
in
consequence
open
the
prosecution
the
echo
rang
in
an
absolute
agony
from
his
hearer
he
had
thought
of
it
as
at
its
worst
only
a
question
between
himself
and
cecil
the
accused
gave
no
sigh
the
rigidity
and
composure
he
had
sustained
throughout
did
not
change
but
at
the
seraph
accent
the
hunted
and
pathetic
misery
which
had
once
before
gleamed
in
his
eyes
came
there
again
he
held
his
comrade
in
a
loyal
and
exceeding
love
he
would
have
let
all
the
world
stone
him
but
he
could
not
have
borne
that
his
friend
should
cast
even
a
look
of
contempt
prosecution
replied
baroni
it
is
a
matter
of
course
my
lord
that
cecil
denies
the
accusation
it
is
very
wise
the
law
specially
cautions
the
accused
to
say
nothing
to
criminate
themselves
but
we
waste
time
in
words
and
pardon
me
if
you
have
your
friend
interest
at
heart
you
will
withdraw
this
very
stormy
championship
this
utterly
useless
opposition
to
an
inevitable
line
of
action
i
must
attest
cecil
but
i
am
willing
for
i
know
to
high
families
these
misfortunes
are
terribly
distressing
to
conduct
everything
with
the
strictest
privacy
and
delicacy
in
a
word
if
you
and
he
consult
his
interests
he
will
accompany
me
unresistingly
otherwise
i
must
summon
legal
force
any
opposition
will
only
compel
a
very
unseemly
encounter
of
physical
force
and
with
it
the
publicity
i
am
desirous
for
the
sake
of
his
relatives
and
position
to
spare
a
dead
silence
followed
his
words
the
silence
that
follows
on
an
insult
that
can
not
be
averted
or
avenged
on
a
thing
too
hideously
shameful
for
the
thoughts
to
grasp
it
as
reality
in
the
first
moment
of
baroni
words
cecil
eyes
had
gleamed
again
with
that
dark
and
desperate
flash
of
a
passion
that
would
have
been
worse
to
face
even
than
his
comrade
wrath
it
died
however
instantly
repressed
by
a
marvelous
strength
of
control
whatever
its
motive
he
was
simply
as
he
had
been
throughout
passive
so
passive
that
even
ezra
baroni
who
knew
what
the
seraph
never
dreamed
looked
at
him
in
wonder
and
felt
a
faint
sickly
fear
of
that
singular
unbroken
calm
it
perplexed
him
the
first
thing
which
had
ever
done
so
in
his
own
peculiar
paths
of
finesse
and
of
intrigue
the
one
placed
in
ignorance
between
them
at
once
as
it
were
the
judge
and
champion
of
his
felt
wild
and
blind
under
this
unutterable
shame
which
seemed
to
net
them
both
in
such
close
and
hopeless
meshes
he
heir
to
one
of
the
greatest
coronets
in
the
world
must
see
his
friend
branded
as
a
common
felon
and
could
do
no
more
to
aid
or
to
avenge
him
than
if
he
were
a
toiling
yonder
in
the
pine
woods
his
words
were
hoarse
and
broken
as
he
spoke
cecil
tell
me
what
is
to
be
done
this
infamous
outrage
can
not
pass
can
not
go
on
i
will
send
for
the
duke
for
send
for
no
bertie
voice
was
slightly
weaker
like
that
of
a
man
exhausted
by
a
long
struggle
but
it
was
firm
and
very
quiet
its
composure
fell
on
rockingham
tempestuous
grief
and
rage
with
a
sickly
silencing
awe
with
a
terrible
sense
of
some
evil
here
beyond
his
knowledge
and
ministering
and
of
an
impotence
alike
to
act
and
to
serve
to
defend
and
to
avenge
the
deadliest
thing
his
fearless
life
had
ever
known
pardon
me
my
lord
interposed
baroni
i
can
waste
time
no
more
you
must
be
now
convinced
yourself
of
your
friend
implication
in
this
very
distressing
i
the
seraph
majesty
of
haughtiest
amaze
and
scorn
blazed
from
his
azure
eyes
on
the
man
who
dared
say
this
thing
to
him
i
if
you
dare
hint
such
a
damnable
shame
to
my
face
again
i
will
wring
your
neck
with
as
little
remorse
as
i
would
a
kite
i
believe
in
his
guilt
forgive
me
cecil
that
i
can
even
repeat
the
word
i
believe
in
it
i
would
as
soon
believe
in
my
own
disgrace
in
my
father
dishonor
how
will
your
lordship
account
then
for
cecil
total
inability
to
tell
us
know
he
spent
the
hours
between
six
and
nine
on
the
unable
he
is
not
unable
he
declines
bertie
tell
me
what
you
did
that
one
cursed
evening
whatever
it
was
wherever
it
was
say
it
for
my
sake
and
shame
this
cecil
would
more
willingly
have
stood
a
line
of
leveled
aimed
at
his
heart
than
that
passionate
entreaty
from
the
man
he
loved
best
on
earth
he
staggered
slightly
as
if
he
were
about
to
fall
and
a
faint
white
foam
came
on
his
lips
but
he
recovered
himself
almost
instantly
it
was
so
natural
to
him
to
repress
every
emotion
that
it
was
simply
old
habit
to
do
so
now
i
have
answered
he
said
very
low
each
word
a
pang
i
can
not
baroni
waved
his
hand
again
with
the
same
polite
significant
gesture
in
that
case
then
there
is
but
one
alternative
will
you
follow
me
quietly
sir
or
must
force
be
employed
i
will
go
with
the
reply
was
very
tranquil
but
in
the
look
that
met
his
own
as
it
was
given
baroni
saw
that
some
other
motive
than
that
of
any
fear
was
its
spring
that
some
cause
beyond
the
mere
abhorrence
of
a
scene
was
at
the
root
of
the
quiescence
it
must
be
so
said
cecil
huskily
to
his
friend
this
man
is
right
so
far
as
he
knows
he
is
only
acting
on
his
own
convictions
we
can
not
blame
him
the
whole
is
a
mystery
an
error
but
as
it
stands
there
is
no
resistance
by
god
i
would
resist
if
i
shot
him
dead
or
shot
myself
stay
wait
one
moment
if
it
be
an
error
in
the
sense
you
mean
it
must
be
a
forgery
of
your
name
as
of
mine
you
think
that
i
did
not
say
the
seraph
gave
him
a
rapid
shuddering
glance
for
once
the
suspicion
crept
in
on
him
was
this
guilt
yet
even
now
the
doubt
would
not
be
harbored
by
him
say
so
you
must
mean
so
you
deny
them
as
yours
what
can
they
be
but
forgeries
there
is
no
other
explanation
i
think
the
whole
matter
a
conspiracy
to
extort
money
but
i
may
be
wrong
let
that
pass
if
it
be
on
the
contrary
an
imitation
of
both
our
signatures
that
has
been
palmed
off
upon
these
usurers
it
is
open
to
other
treatment
compensated
for
their
pecuniary
loss
they
can
have
no
need
to
press
the
matter
further
unless
they
find
out
the
delinquent
see
here
he
went
to
a
at
the
end
of
the
room
flung
the
lid
back
swept
out
a
heap
of
papers
and
wrenching
a
blank
check
from
the
book
threw
it
down
before
baroni
here
fill
it
up
as
you
like
and
i
will
sign
it
in
exchange
for
the
forged
baroni
paused
a
moment
money
he
loved
with
an
adoration
that
excluded
every
other
passion
that
blank
check
that
limitless
carte
blanche
that
vast
exchequer
from
which
to
draw
it
was
a
sore
temptation
he
thought
wistfully
of
the
welsher
peremptory
forbiddance
of
all
compromise
of
the
welsher
inexorable
command
to
wring
the
bird
lose
whatever
might
be
lost
by
it
cecil
ere
the
hebrew
could
speak
leaned
forward
took
the
check
and
tore
it
in
two
god
bless
you
rock
he
said
so
low
that
it
only
reached
the
ear
but
you
must
not
do
beauty
you
are
mad
cried
the
marquis
passionately
if
this
villainous
thing
be
a
forgery
you
are
its
victim
as
much
as
i
tenfold
more
than
i
if
this
jew
chooses
to
sell
the
paper
to
me
naming
his
own
compensation
whose
affair
is
it
except
his
and
mine
they
have
been
losers
we
indemnify
them
it
rests
with
us
to
find
out
the
criminal
baroni
there
are
a
hundred
more
checks
in
that
book
name
your
price
and
you
shall
have
it
or
if
you
prefer
my
father
i
will
send
to
him
for
it
his
grace
will
sign
one
without
a
question
of
its
errand
if
i
ask
him
come
your
price
baroni
had
recovered
the
momentary
temptation
and
was
strong
in
the
austerity
of
virtue
in
the
unassailability
of
social
duty
you
behave
most
nobly
most
generously
by
your
friend
my
lord
he
said
politely
i
am
glad
such
friendship
exists
on
earth
but
you
really
ask
me
what
is
not
in
my
power
in
the
first
place
i
am
but
one
of
the
firm
and
have
no
authority
to
act
alone
in
the
second
i
most
certainly
were
i
alone
should
decline
totally
any
pecuniary
compromise
a
great
criminal
action
is
not
to
be
hushed
up
by
any
monetary
arrangement
you
my
lord
marquis
may
be
ignorant
in
the
guards
of
a
very
coarse
term
used
in
law
called
a
felony
that
is
what
you
tempt
me
to
the
seraph
with
one
of
those
oaths
that
made
the
hebrew
blood
run
cold
though
he
was
no
coward
opened
his
lips
to
speak
cecil
arrested
him
with
that
singular
impassiveness
that
apathy
of
resignation
which
had
characterized
his
whole
conduct
throughout
save
at
a
few
brief
moments
make
no
opposition
the
man
is
acting
but
in
his
own
justification
i
will
wait
for
mine
to
resist
would
be
to
degrade
us
with
a
brawl
they
have
the
law
with
them
let
it
take
its
the
seraph
dashed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
he
felt
blind
the
room
seemed
to
reel
with
him
oh
god
that
you
he
could
not
finish
the
words
that
his
comrade
his
friend
one
of
his
own
corps
of
his
own
world
should
be
arrested
like
the
blackest
thief
in
whitechapel
or
in
the
rue
du
temple
cecil
glanced
at
him
and
his
eyes
grew
infinitely
yearning
infinitely
gentle
a
shudder
shook
him
all
through
his
limbs
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
stretched
out
his
hand
will
you
take
it
still
almost
before
the
words
were
spoken
his
hand
was
held
in
both
of
the
seraph
take
it
before
all
the
world
always
come
what
his
eyes
were
dim
as
he
spoke
and
his
rich
voice
rang
clear
as
the
ring
of
silver
though
there
was
the
tremor
of
emotion
in
it
he
had
forgotten
the
hebrew
presence
he
had
forgotten
all
save
his
friend
and
his
friend
extremity
cecil
did
not
answer
if
he
had
done
so
all
the
courage
all
the
calm
all
the
control
that
pride
and
breeding
alike
sustained
in
him
would
have
been
shattered
down
to
weakness
his
hand
closed
fast
in
his
companion
his
eyes
met
his
once
in
a
look
of
gratitude
that
pierced
the
heart
of
the
other
like
a
knife
then
he
turned
to
the
jew
with
a
haughty
serenity
m
baroni
i
am
wait
cried
rockingham
where
you
go
i
the
hebrew
interposed
demurely
forgive
me
my
lord
not
now
you
can
take
what
steps
you
will
as
regards
your
friend
later
on
and
you
may
rest
assured
he
will
be
treated
with
all
delicacy
compatible
with
the
case
but
you
can
not
accompany
him
now
i
rely
on
his
word
to
go
with
me
quietly
but
i
now
regard
him
and
you
must
remember
this
as
not
the
son
of
viscount
royallieu
not
the
honorable
bertie
cecil
of
the
life
guards
not
the
friend
of
one
so
distinguished
as
yourself
but
as
simply
an
arrested
baroni
could
not
deny
himself
that
last
sting
of
his
vengeance
yet
as
he
saw
the
faces
of
the
men
on
whom
he
flung
the
insult
he
felt
for
the
moment
that
he
might
pay
for
his
temerity
with
his
life
he
put
his
hand
above
his
eyes
with
a
quick
involuntary
movement
like
a
man
who
wards
off
a
blow
gentlemen
and
his
teeth
chattered
as
he
spoke
one
sign
of
violence
and
i
shall
summon
legal
cecil
caught
the
seraph
lifted
arm
and
stayed
it
in
its
vengeance
his
own
teeth
were
clinched
tight
as
a
vise
and
over
the
haggard
whiteness
of
his
face
a
deep
red
blush
had
come
we
degrade
ourselves
by
resistance
let
me
go
they
must
do
what
they
will
my
reckoning
must
wait
and
my
justification
one
word
only
take
the
king
and
keep
him
for
my
another
moment
and
the
door
had
closed
he
was
gone
out
to
his
fate
and
the
seraph
with
no
eyes
on
him
bowed
down
his
head
upon
his
arms
where
he
leaned
against
the
marble
table
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
life
felt
the
hot
tears
roll
down
his
face
like
rain
as
the
passion
of
a
woman
mastered
and
unmanned
him
he
would
sooner
a
thousand
times
have
laid
his
friend
down
in
his
grave
than
have
seen
him
live
for
this
cecil
went
slowly
out
beside
his
accuser
the
keen
bright
eyes
of
the
jew
kept
vigilant
watch
and
ward
on
him
a
single
sign
of
any
effort
to
evade
him
would
have
been
arrested
by
him
in
an
instant
with
preconcerted
skill
he
looked
and
saw
that
no
thought
of
escape
was
in
his
prisoner
mind
cecil
had
surrendered
himself
and
he
went
to
his
doom
he
laid
no
blame
on
baroni
and
he
scarce
gave
him
a
remembrance
the
hebrew
did
not
stand
to
him
in
the
colors
he
wore
to
rockingham
who
beheld
this
thing
but
on
its
surface
baroni
was
to
him
only
the
agent
of
an
inevitable
shame
of
a
hapless
fate
that
closed
him
in
netting
him
tight
with
the
web
of
his
own
past
actions
no
more
than
the
irresponsible
executioner
of
what
was
in
the
jew
sight
and
knowledge
a
just
sentence
he
condemned
his
accuser
in
nothing
no
more
than
the
conscience
of
a
guilty
man
can
condemn
the
discoverers
and
the
instruments
of
his
chastisement
was
he
guilty
any
judge
might
have
said
that
he
knew
himself
to
be
so
as
he
passed
down
the
staircase
and
outward
to
the
entrance
with
that
dead
resignation
on
his
face
that
brooding
rigid
look
set
on
his
features
and
gazing
almost
in
stupefaction
out
from
the
dark
hazel
depths
of
eyes
that
women
had
loved
for
their
luster
their
languor
and
the
softness
of
their
smile
they
walked
out
into
the
evening
air
unnoticed
he
had
given
his
consent
to
follow
the
without
resistance
and
he
had
no
thought
to
break
his
word
he
had
submitted
himself
to
the
inevitable
course
of
this
fate
that
had
fallen
on
him
and
the
whole
tone
of
his
temper
and
his
breeding
lent
him
the
quiescence
though
he
had
none
of
the
doctrine
of
a
supreme
fatalist
there
were
carriages
standing
before
the
hotel
waiting
for
those
who
were
going
to
the
ballroom
to
the
theater
to
an
archduke
dinner
to
a
princess
entertainment
he
looked
at
them
with
a
vague
strange
sense
of
unreality
these
things
of
the
life
from
which
he
was
now
barred
forever
the
sparkling
tide
of
existence
in
baden
was
flowing
on
its
way
and
he
went
out
an
accused
felon
branded
and
outlawed
and
dishonored
from
all
place
in
the
world
that
he
had
led
and
been
caressed
by
and
beguiled
with
for
so
long
at
this
hour
he
should
have
been
among
all
that
was
highest
and
gayest
and
fairest
in
europe
at
the
banquet
of
a
prince
and
he
went
by
his
captor
side
a
convicted
criminal
once
out
in
the
air
the
hebrew
laid
his
hand
on
his
arm
he
started
it
was
the
first
sign
that
his
liberty
was
gone
he
restrained
himself
from
all
resistance
still
and
passed
onward
down
where
baroni
motioned
him
out
of
the
noise
of
the
carriages
out
of
the
glare
of
the
light
into
the
narrow
darkened
turning
of
a
side
street
he
went
passively
for
this
man
trusted
to
his
honor
in
the
gloom
stood
three
figures
looming
indistinctly
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
one
was
a
huissier
of
the
beside
whom
stood
the
commissary
of
police
of
the
district
the
third
was
an
english
detective
ere
he
saw
them
their
hands
were
on
his
shoulders
and
the
cold
chill
of
steel
touched
his
wrists
the
hebrew
had
betrayed
him
and
arrested
him
in
the
open
street
in
an
instant
as
the
ring
of
the
rifle
rouses
the
slumbering
tiger
all
the
life
and
the
soul
that
were
in
him
rose
in
revolt
as
the
icy
glide
of
the
handcuffs
sought
their
hold
on
his
arms
in
an
instant
all
the
wild
blood
of
his
race
all
the
pride
of
his
breeding
all
the
honor
of
his
service
flashed
into
fire
and
leaped
into
action
trusted
he
would
have
been
true
to
his
accuser
deceived
the
chains
of
his
promise
were
loosened
and
all
he
thought
all
he
felt
all
he
knew
were
the
lion
impulses
the
knightly
instincts
the
resolute
choice
to
lose
life
rather
than
to
lose
freedom
of
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
all
he
remembered
was
that
he
would
fight
to
the
death
rather
than
be
taken
alive
that
they
should
kill
him
where
he
stood
in
the
starlight
rather
than
lead
him
in
the
sight
of
men
as
a
felon
with
the
strength
that
lay
beneath
all
the
gentle
languor
of
his
habits
and
with
the
science
of
the
eton
playing
fields
of
his
boyhood
he
wrenched
his
wrists
free
ere
the
steel
had
closed
and
with
the
single
straightening
of
his
left
arm
felled
the
detective
to
earth
like
a
bullock
with
a
crashing
blow
that
sounded
through
the
stillness
like
some
heavy
timber
stove
in
flinging
himself
like
lightning
on
the
huissier
he
twisted
out
of
his
grasp
the
metal
weight
of
the
handcuffs
and
wrestling
with
him
was
woven
for
a
second
in
that
struggle
which
is
only
seen
when
the
wrestlers
wrestle
for
life
and
death
the
german
was
a
powerful
and
firmly
built
man
but
science
was
the
finer
and
the
most
masterly
his
long
slender
delicate
limbs
seemed
to
twine
and
writhe
around
the
massive
form
of
his
antagonist
like
the
coils
of
a
cobra
they
rocked
and
swayed
to
and
fro
on
the
stones
while
the
shrill
shrieking
voice
of
baroni
filled
the
night
with
its
clamor
the
viselike
pressure
of
the
stalwart
arms
of
his
opponent
crushed
him
in
till
his
ribs
seemed
to
bend
and
break
under
the
breathless
oppression
the
iron
force
but
desperation
nerved
him
the
royallieu
blood
that
never
took
defeat
was
roused
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
careless
life
his
skill
and
his
nerve
were
unrivaled
and
with
a
last
effort
he
dashed
the
huissier
off
him
and
lifting
him
up
he
never
knew
how
as
he
would
have
lifted
a
log
of
wood
hurled
him
down
in
the
white
streak
of
moonlight
that
alone
slanted
through
the
peaked
roofs
of
the
crooked
the
cries
of
baroni
had
already
been
heard
a
crowd
drawn
by
their
shrieking
appeals
were
bearing
toward
the
place
in
tumult
the
jew
had
the
quick
wit
to
give
them
as
that
it
was
a
croupier
who
had
been
found
cheating
and
fled
it
sufficed
to
inflame
the
whole
mob
against
the
fugitive
cecil
looked
round
him
once
such
a
glance
as
a
royal
gives
when
the
are
panting
about
him
and
the
fangs
are
in
his
throat
then
with
the
swiftness
of
the
deer
itself
he
dashed
downward
into
the
gloom
of
the
winding
passage
at
the
speed
which
had
carried
him
in
many
a
victor
in
the
old
green
eton
meadows
there
was
scarce
a
man
in
the
queen
service
who
could
rival
him
for
lightness
of
limb
for
power
of
endurance
in
every
sport
of
field
and
fell
of
the
moor
and
the
gymnasium
and
the
athletic
pleasures
of
many
a
happy
hour
stood
him
in
good
stead
now
in
the
emergence
of
his
terrible
extremity
flight
for
the
instant
the
word
thrilled
through
him
with
a
loathing
sense
flight
the
craven
refuge
the
criminal
resource
he
wished
in
the
moment
agony
that
they
would
send
a
bullet
through
his
brain
as
he
ran
rather
than
drive
him
out
to
this
flight
he
felt
a
coward
and
a
felon
as
he
fled
fled
from
every
fairer
thing
from
every
peaceful
hour
from
the
friendship
and
good
will
of
men
from
the
fame
of
his
ancient
race
from
the
smile
of
the
women
that
loved
him
from
all
that
makes
life
rich
and
fair
from
all
that
men
call
honor
fled
to
leave
his
name
disgraced
in
the
service
he
adored
fled
to
leave
the
world
to
think
him
a
guilty
dastard
who
dared
not
face
his
trial
fled
to
bid
his
closest
friend
believe
him
low
sunk
in
the
depths
of
foulest
felony
branded
forever
with
a
criminal
shame
by
his
own
act
by
his
own
hand
flight
it
has
bitter
pangs
that
make
brave
men
feel
cowards
when
they
fly
from
tyranny
and
danger
and
death
to
a
land
of
peace
and
promise
but
in
his
flight
he
left
behind
him
all
that
made
life
worth
the
living
and
went
out
to
meet
eternal
misery
renouncing
every
hope
yielding
up
all
his
future
it
is
for
her
sake
and
his
he
thought
and
without
a
moment
pause
without
a
backward
look
he
ran
as
the
stag
runs
with
the
bay
of
the
pack
behind
it
down
into
the
shadows
of
the
night
the
hue
and
cry
was
after
him
the
tumult
of
a
crowd
excitement
raised
it
knows
not
why
or
wherefore
was
on
his
steps
joined
with
the
steadier
and
keener
pursuit
of
men
organized
for
the
hunter
work
and
trained
to
follow
the
faintest
track
the
slightest
clew
the
moon
was
out
and
they
saw
him
clearly
though
the
marvelous
fleetness
of
his
stride
had
borne
him
far
ahead
in
the
few
moments
start
he
had
gained
he
heard
the
beat
of
their
many
feet
on
the
stones
the
dull
thud
of
their
running
the
loud
clamor
of
the
mob
the
shrill
cries
of
the
hebrew
offering
gold
with
frantic
lavishness
to
whoever
should
stop
his
prey
all
the
breathless
excitation
all
the
keen
and
desperate
straining
all
the
tension
of
the
struggle
that
he
had
known
so
often
over
the
brown
autumn
country
of
the
shires
at
home
he
knew
now
intensified
to
horror
made
deadly
with
despair
changed
into
a
race
for
life
and
death
yet
with
it
the
wild
blood
in
him
woke
the
recklessness
of
peril
the
daring
and
defiant
courage
that
lay
beneath
his
levity
and
languor
heated
his
veins
and
spurred
his
strength
he
was
ready
to
die
if
they
chose
to
slaughter
him
but
for
his
freedom
he
strove
as
men
will
strive
for
life
to
distance
them
to
escape
them
he
would
have
breathed
his
last
at
the
goal
they
might
fire
him
down
if
they
would
but
he
swore
in
his
teeth
to
die
free
some
germans
in
his
path
hearing
the
shouts
that
thundered
after
him
in
the
night
drew
their
across
the
down
which
he
turned
and
blocked
the
narrow
road
he
saw
it
in
time
a
second
later
and
it
would
have
been
instant
death
to
him
at
the
pace
he
went
he
saw
it
and
gathered
all
the
force
and
nervous
impetus
in
his
frame
to
the
trial
as
he
came
rushing
downward
along
the
slope
of
the
lane
with
his
elbows
back
and
his
body
straight
as
run
the
wagon
sideways
stretched
across
a
solid
barrier
heaped
up
with
fir
boughs
brought
for
firing
from
the
forests
the
mules
stood
abreast
yoked
together
the
mob
following
saw
too
and
gave
a
hoot
and
yell
of
brutal
triumph
their
prey
was
in
their
clutches
the
cart
barred
his
progress
and
he
must
double
like
a
fox
faced
with
a
stone
wall
scarcely
they
did
not
know
the
man
with
whom
they
had
to
deal
the
daring
and
the
coolness
that
the
languid
surface
of
indolent
fashion
had
covered
even
in
the
imminence
of
supreme
peril
of
breathless
jeopardy
he
measured
with
unerring
eye
the
distance
and
the
need
rose
as
lightly
in
the
air
as
forest
king
had
risen
with
him
over
fence
and
hedge
and
with
a
single
running
leap
cleared
the
width
of
the
mules
backs
and
landing
safely
on
the
farther
side
dashed
on
scarcely
pausing
for
breath
the
yell
that
hissed
in
his
wake
as
the
throng
saw
him
escape
by
what
to
their
slow
teutonic
instincts
seemed
a
devil
miracle
was
on
his
ear
like
the
bay
of
the
to
the
deer
they
might
kill
him
if
they
could
but
they
should
never
take
him
captive
and
the
moon
was
so
brightly
so
pitilessly
clear
shining
down
in
the
summer
light
as
though
in
love
with
the
beauty
of
earth
he
looked
up
once
the
stars
seemed
reeling
round
him
in
disordered
riot
the
chill
face
of
the
moon
looked
unpitying
as
death
all
this
loveliness
was
round
him
this
glory
of
sailing
cloud
and
shadowy
forest
and
tranquil
planet
and
there
was
no
help
for
him
a
gay
burst
of
music
broke
on
the
stillness
from
the
distance
he
had
left
the
brilliance
of
the
town
behind
him
and
was
now
in
its
and
outskirts
the
sound
seemed
to
thrill
him
to
the
bone
it
was
like
the
echo
of
the
lost
life
he
was
leaving
forever
he
saw
he
felt
he
heard
he
thought
feeling
and
sense
were
quickened
in
him
as
they
had
never
been
before
yet
he
never
slackened
his
pace
save
once
or
twice
when
he
paused
for
breath
he
ran
as
swiftly
he
ran
as
keenly
as
ever
stag
or
fox
had
run
before
him
doubling
with
their
skill
taking
the
shadow
as
they
took
the
covert
noting
with
their
rapid
eye
the
safest
track
outracing
with
their
rapid
speed
the
pursuit
that
thundered
in
his
wake
the
he
took
were
deserted
and
he
was
now
out
of
the
town
with
the
open
country
and
forest
lying
before
him
the
people
whom
he
met
rushed
out
of
his
path
happily
for
him
they
were
few
and
were
terrified
because
they
thought
him
a
madman
broken
loose
from
his
keepers
he
never
looked
back
but
he
could
tell
that
the
pursuit
was
falling
farther
and
farther
behind
him
that
the
speed
at
which
he
went
was
breaking
the
powers
of
his
hunters
fresh
throngs
added
indeed
to
the
first
pursuers
as
they
tore
down
through
the
starlight
night
but
none
had
the
science
with
which
he
went
the
trained
matchless
skill
of
the
university
he
left
them
more
and
more
behind
him
each
second
of
the
breathless
chase
that
endless
as
it
seemed
had
lasted
bare
three
minutes
if
the
night
were
but
dark
he
felt
that
pitiless
luminance
glistening
bright
about
him
everywhere
shining
over
all
the
summer
world
and
leaving
scarce
a
shadow
to
fall
athwart
his
way
the
silver
glory
of
the
radiance
was
shed
on
every
rood
of
ground
one
hour
of
a
winter
night
one
hour
of
the
sweeping
rain
of
an
autumn
storm
and
he
could
have
made
for
shelter
as
the
stag
makes
for
it
across
the
broad
brown
highland
water
before
him
stretched
indeed
the
gloom
of
the
masses
of
pine
the
upward
slopes
of
hills
the
vastness
of
the
black
forest
but
they
were
like
the
mirage
to
a
man
who
dies
in
a
desert
he
knew
at
the
pace
he
went
he
could
not
live
to
reach
them
the
blood
was
beating
in
his
brain
and
pumping
from
his
heart
a
tightness
like
an
iron
band
seemed
girt
about
his
loins
his
lips
began
to
draw
his
breath
in
with
loud
gasping
spasms
he
knew
that
in
a
little
space
his
speed
must
slacken
he
knew
it
by
the
roar
like
the
noise
of
water
that
was
rushing
on
his
ear
and
the
oppression
like
a
hand
hard
grip
that
seemed
above
his
heart
but
he
would
go
till
he
died
go
till
they
fired
on
him
go
though
the
skies
felt
swirling
round
like
a
sea
of
fire
and
the
hard
hot
earth
beneath
his
feet
jarred
his
whole
frame
as
his
feet
struck
it
flying
the
angle
of
an
old
wood
house
with
towering
roof
and
gables
threw
a
depth
of
shadow
at
last
across
his
road
a
shadow
black
and
rayless
darker
for
the
white
glisten
of
the
moon
around
built
more
in
the
swiss
than
the
german
style
a
massive
balcony
of
wood
ran
round
it
upon
and
beneath
which
in
its
heavy
shade
was
an
impenetrable
gloom
while
the
twisted
wooden
pillars
ran
upward
to
the
gallery
with
rapid
perception
and
intuition
he
divined
rather
than
saw
these
things
and
swinging
himself
up
with
noiseless
lightness
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
rough
flooring
of
the
balcony
if
they
passed
he
was
safe
for
a
brief
time
more
at
least
if
they
found
him
his
teeth
clinched
like
a
mastiff
where
he
lay
he
had
the
strength
in
him
still
to
sell
his
life
dearly
the
pursuers
came
closer
and
closer
and
by
the
clamors
that
floated
up
in
indistinct
and
broken
fragments
he
knew
that
they
had
tracked
him
he
heard
the
tramp
of
their
feet
as
they
came
under
the
loggia
he
heard
the
click
of
the
pistols
they
were
close
upon
him
at
last
in
the
blackness
of
night
chapter
xii
the
king
last
service
is
he
up
there
asked
a
voice
in
the
darkness
not
likely
a
cat
could
scramble
up
that
woodwork
answered
a
second
send
a
shot
and
try
suggested
a
third
there
he
lay
stretched
motionless
on
the
flat
roof
of
the
veranda
he
heard
the
words
as
the
thronging
mob
surged
and
trampled
and
swore
and
quarreled
beneath
him
in
the
blackness
of
the
gloom
balked
of
their
prey
and
savage
for
some
amends
there
was
a
moment
pause
a
hurried
eager
consultation
then
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
charge
being
rammed
down
and
the
sharp
drawing
out
of
a
ramrod
there
was
a
flash
a
report
a
line
of
light
flamed
a
second
in
his
sight
a
ball
hissed
past
him
with
a
loud
singing
rush
and
bedded
itself
in
the
timber
a
few
inches
above
his
uncovered
hair
a
dead
silence
followed
then
the
muttering
of
many
voices
broke
out
afresh
he
not
there
at
any
rate
said
one
who
seemed
the
chief
he
could
have
kept
as
still
as
that
with
a
shot
so
near
him
he
made
for
the
open
country
and
the
forest
i
take
my
then
the
trending
of
many
feet
trampled
their
way
out
from
beneath
the
loggia
their
voices
and
their
rapid
steps
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
they
hurried
away
through
the
night
for
a
while
at
least
he
was
safe
for
some
moments
he
lay
prostrated
there
the
rushing
of
the
blood
on
his
brain
the
beating
of
his
heart
the
panting
of
his
breath
the
quivering
of
his
limbs
after
the
intense
muscular
effort
he
had
gone
through
mastered
him
and
flung
him
down
there
beaten
and
powerless
he
felt
the
foam
on
his
lips
and
he
thought
with
every
instant
that
the
surcharged
veins
would
burst
hands
of
steel
seemed
to
crush
in
upon
his
chest
knotted
cords
to
tighten
in
excruciating
pain
about
his
loins
he
breathed
in
short
convulsive
gasps
his
eyes
were
blind
and
his
head
swam
a
dreaming
fancy
that
this
was
death
vaguely
came
on
him
and
he
was
glad
it
should
be
so
his
eyelids
closed
unconsciously
weighed
down
as
by
the
weight
of
lead
he
saw
the
starry
skies
above
him
no
more
and
the
distant
noise
of
the
pursuit
waxed
duller
and
duller
on
his
ear
then
he
lost
all
sense
and
memory
he
ceased
even
to
feel
the
night
air
on
his
face
how
long
he
lay
there
he
never
knew
when
consciousness
returned
to
him
all
was
still
the
moon
was
shining
down
clear
as
the
day
the
west
wind
was
blowing
softly
among
his
hair
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
leaned
against
the
timber
of
the
upper
wall
the
shelving
impenetrable
darkness
sloped
below
above
were
the
glories
of
a
summer
sky
at
midnight
around
him
the
hills
and
woods
were
bathed
in
the
silver
light
he
looked
and
he
remembered
all
he
had
escaped
his
captors
but
for
how
long
while
yet
there
were
some
hours
of
the
night
left
he
must
find
some
surer
refuge
or
fall
into
their
hands
again
yet
it
was
strange
that
in
this
moment
his
own
misery
and
his
own
peril
were
less
upon
him
than
a
longing
to
see
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
the
woman
for
whose
sake
he
suffered
this
their
love
had
had
the
lightness
and
the
languor
of
their
world
and
had
had
but
little
depth
in
it
yet
in
that
hour
of
his
supreme
sacrifice
to
her
he
loved
her
as
he
had
not
loved
in
his
life
recklessness
had
always
been
latent
in
him
with
all
his
serenity
and
impassiveness
a
reckless
resolve
entered
him
now
reckless
to
madness
lightly
and
cautiously
though
his
sinews
still
ached
and
his
nerves
still
throbbed
with
the
past
strain
he
let
himself
fall
hand
over
hand
as
men
go
down
a
rope
along
the
woodwork
to
the
ground
once
touching
earth
off
he
glided
swiftly
and
noiselessly
keeping
in
the
shadow
of
the
walls
all
the
length
of
the
streets
he
took
and
shunning
every
place
where
any
sort
of
tumult
could
suggest
the
neighborhood
of
those
who
were
out
and
hunting
him
down
as
it
chanced
they
had
taken
to
the
open
country
he
passed
on
unquestioned
and
wound
his
way
to
the
kursaal
he
remembered
that
there
was
a
masked
ball
at
which
all
the
princely
and
titled
world
of
baden
were
present
to
which
he
would
himself
have
gone
after
the
russian
dinner
by
the
look
of
the
stars
he
saw
that
it
must
be
midnight
or
past
the
ball
would
be
now
at
its
height
the
wildness
and
the
cool
quietude
that
were
so
intimately
and
intricately
mingled
in
his
nature
could
alone
have
prompted
and
projected
such
a
thought
and
such
an
action
as
suggested
themselves
to
him
now
in
the
moment
of
his
direst
extremity
of
his
utter
hopelessness
of
his
most
imminent
peril
he
went
to
take
a
last
look
at
his
mistress
baden
for
aught
he
knew
might
be
but
one
vast
network
to
mesh
in
and
to
capture
him
yet
he
ran
the
risk
with
the
dauntless
temerity
that
had
ever
lain
underneath
the
indifferentism
and
the
indolence
of
his
habits
keeping
always
in
the
shadow
and
moving
slowly
so
as
to
attract
no
notice
from
those
he
passed
he
made
his
way
deliberately
straight
toward
the
blaze
of
light
where
all
the
gayety
of
the
town
was
centered
he
reckoned
and
rightly
as
it
proved
that
the
rumor
of
his
story
the
noise
of
his
pursuit
would
not
have
penetrated
here
as
yet
his
own
world
would
be
still
in
ignorance
a
moment
that
was
all
he
wanted
just
to
look
upon
a
woman
beauty
he
went
forward
daringly
and
tranquilly
to
the
venture
if
any
had
told
him
that
a
vein
of
romance
was
in
him
he
would
have
stared
and
thought
them
madmen
yet
something
almost
as
wild
was
in
his
instinct
now
he
had
lost
so
much
to
keep
her
honor
from
attainder
he
wished
to
meet
the
gaze
of
her
fair
eyes
once
more
before
he
went
out
to
exile
in
one
of
the
string
of
waiting
carriages
he
saw
a
loose
domino
lying
on
the
seat
he
knew
the
liveries
and
the
footmen
and
he
signed
them
to
open
the
door
tell
count
carl
i
have
borrowed
these
he
said
to
the
servant
as
he
sprang
into
the
vehicle
slipped
the
domino
on
took
the
mask
and
left
the
carriage
the
man
touched
his
hat
and
said
nothing
he
knew
cecil
well
as
an
intimate
friend
of
his
young
austrian
master
in
that
masquerade
guise
he
was
safe
for
the
few
minutes
at
least
which
were
all
he
dared
take
he
went
on
mingled
among
the
glittering
throng
and
pierced
his
way
to
the
ballroom
the
venetian
mask
covering
his
features
many
spoke
to
him
by
the
colors
they
took
him
for
the
austrian
he
answered
none
and
treaded
his
way
among
the
blaze
of
hues
the
joyous
echoes
of
the
music
the
flutter
of
the
silk
and
satin
dominoes
the
mischievous
challenge
of
whispers
his
eyes
sought
only
one
he
soon
saw
her
in
the
white
and
silver
with
the
spray
of
eastern
flowers
by
which
he
had
been
told
days
ago
to
recognize
her
a
crowd
of
dominoes
were
about
her
some
masked
some
not
her
eyes
glanced
through
the
envious
disguise
and
her
lips
were
laughing
he
approached
her
with
all
his
old
tact
in
the
art
le
cotillon
not
hurriedly
so
as
to
attract
notice
but
carefully
so
as
to
glide
into
a
place
near
her
you
promised
me
this
waltz
he
said
very
gently
in
her
ear
i
have
come
in
time
for
she
recognized
him
by
his
voice
and
turned
from
a
french
prince
to
rebuke
him
for
his
truancy
with
gay
raillery
and
much
anger
forgive
me
and
let
me
have
this
one
waltz
please
do
she
glanced
at
him
a
moment
and
let
him
lead
her
out
no
one
has
my
step
as
you
have
it
bertie
she
murmured
as
they
glided
into
the
measure
of
the
dance
she
thought
his
glance
fell
sadly
on
her
as
he
smiled
no
but
others
will
soon
learn
yet
he
had
never
treaded
more
deftly
the
maze
of
the
waltzers
never
trodden
more
softly
more
swiftly
or
with
more
science
the
polished
floor
the
waltz
was
perfect
she
did
not
know
it
was
also
a
farewell
the
delicate
perfume
of
her
floating
dress
the
gleam
of
the
scarlet
the
flash
of
the
diamonds
studding
her
domino
the
fragrance
of
her
lips
as
they
breathed
so
near
his
own
they
haunted
him
many
a
long
year
afterward
his
voice
was
very
calm
his
smile
was
very
gentle
his
step
as
he
swung
easily
through
the
intricacies
of
the
circle
was
none
the
less
smooth
and
sure
for
the
race
that
had
so
late
strained
his
sinews
to
bursting
the
woman
he
loved
saw
no
change
in
him
but
as
the
waltz
drew
to
its
end
she
felt
his
heart
beat
louder
and
quicker
on
her
own
she
felt
his
hand
hold
her
own
more
closely
she
felt
his
head
drooped
over
her
till
his
lips
almost
touched
her
brow
it
was
his
last
embrace
no
other
could
be
given
here
in
the
multitude
of
these
courtly
crowds
then
with
a
few
words
that
thrilled
her
in
their
utterance
and
echoed
in
her
memory
for
years
to
come
he
resigned
her
to
the
austrian
grand
duke
who
was
her
next
claimant
and
left
her
silently
forever
less
heroism
has
often
proclaimed
itself
with
blatant
trumpet
to
the
world
a
martyrdom
he
looked
back
once
as
he
passed
from
the
ballroom
back
to
the
sea
of
colors
to
the
glitter
of
light
to
the
moving
hues
amid
which
the
sound
of
the
laughing
intoxicating
music
seemed
to
float
to
the
glisten
of
the
jewels
and
the
gold
and
the
silver
to
the
scene
in
a
word
of
the
life
that
would
be
his
no
more
he
looked
back
in
a
long
lingering
look
such
as
a
man
may
give
the
gladness
of
the
earth
before
the
gates
of
a
prison
close
on
him
then
he
went
out
once
more
into
the
night
threw
the
domino
and
the
mask
back
again
into
the
carriage
and
took
his
way
alone
he
passed
along
till
he
had
gained
the
shadow
of
a
by
a
sheer
unconscious
instinct
then
he
paused
and
looked
round
him
what
could
he
do
he
wondered
vaguely
if
he
were
not
dreaming
the
air
seemed
to
reel
about
him
and
the
earth
to
rock
the
very
force
of
control
he
had
sustained
made
the
reaction
stronger
he
began
to
feel
blind
and
stupefied
how
could
he
escape
the
railway
station
would
be
guarded
by
those
on
the
watch
for
him
he
had
but
a
few
pounds
in
his
pocket
hastily
slipped
in
as
he
had
won
them
at
ecarte
that
day
all
avenues
of
escape
were
closed
to
him
and
he
knew
that
his
limbs
would
refuse
to
carry
him
with
any
kind
of
speed
farther
he
had
only
the
short
precious
hours
remaining
of
the
night
in
which
to
make
good
his
flight
and
flight
he
must
take
to
save
those
for
whom
he
had
elected
to
sacrifice
his
life
yet
how
and
where
a
hurried
noiseless
footfall
came
after
him
rake
voice
came
breathless
on
his
ear
while
the
man
hand
went
up
in
the
unforgotten
soldier
salute
sir
no
words
follow
me
and
i
save
the
one
voice
was
to
him
like
water
in
a
desert
land
he
would
have
trusted
the
speaker
fidelity
with
his
life
he
asked
nothing
said
nothing
but
followed
rapidly
and
in
silence
turning
and
doubling
down
a
score
of
crooked
passages
and
burrowing
at
the
last
like
a
mole
in
a
still
deserted
place
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
some
trees
grew
at
the
back
of
stables
and
in
a
streak
of
the
white
moonlight
stood
two
hunters
saddled
one
was
forest
king
with
a
cry
cecil
threw
his
arms
round
the
animal
neck
he
had
no
thought
then
except
that
he
and
the
horse
must
part
into
saddle
sir
quick
as
your
life
whispered
rake
we
be
far
away
from
this
d
d
den
by
cecil
looked
at
him
like
a
man
in
stupor
his
arm
still
over
the
neck
he
can
have
no
stay
in
him
he
was
on
the
i
know
he
was
sir
but
he
ai
now
he
was
pisined
but
i
a
trick
with
a
that
set
that
sort
o
thing
if
it
ai
gone
too
far
that
is
to
say
right
in
a
brace
of
shakes
i
doctored
him
he
hisself
agen
he
take
you
till
he
the
king
thrust
his
noble
head
closer
in
his
master
bosom
and
made
a
little
murmuring
noise
as
though
he
said
try
me
god
bless
you
rake
cecil
said
huskily
but
i
can
not
take
him
he
will
starve
with
me
and
how
did
you
know
of
this
begging
your
pardon
your
honor
he
eat
chopped
furze
with
you
better
than
he
eat
oats
and
hay
along
of
a
new
master
retorted
rake
rapidly
tightening
the
girths
i
do
know
nothing
sir
save
that
i
heard
you
was
in
a
strait
i
do
want
to
know
nothing
but
i
sees
them
cursed
cads
of
you
to
earth
and
thinks
i
to
myself
what
will
the
king
will
be
the
ticket
for
him
so
i
ran
to
your
room
unbeknown
packed
a
little
valise
and
got
out
the
passports
then
back
again
to
the
stables
and
saddled
him
like
lightning
and
got
off
nobody
knowing
but
bill
there
i
seed
you
go
by
into
the
kursaal
and
laid
in
wait
for
you
sir
i
made
bold
to
bring
mother
o
pearl
for
and
rake
stopped
breathless
and
hoarse
with
passion
and
grief
that
he
would
not
utter
he
had
heard
more
than
he
said
for
yourself
echoed
cecil
what
do
you
mean
my
good
fellow
i
am
ruined
i
shall
be
beggared
from
utterly
i
can
not
even
help
you
or
keep
you
but
lord
rockingham
will
do
both
for
my
the
soldier
struck
his

fidelity

him

when

clover

eyes
looked
up
wistfully
and
eager
as
a
dog
when
he
prays
to
be
let
out
of
kennel
to
follow
the
gun
his
voice
was
husky
and
agitated
with
a
strong
excitement
cecil
stood
a
moment
irresolute
touched
and
pained
at
the
man

not
yielding
to
it

and
cry

the

assent
and
sloped
off
rake
threw
himself
across
the
brown
mare
now

for
our
lives

leagues
away
by
the
and
i
got
their
feed

bait
in
the
forests
off
sir
for
god
sake
or
the
blackguards
will
be
down
on
you
again
as
he
spoke
the
clamor
and
tread
of
men
of
the
town
racing
to
the
chase
were
wafted
to
them
on
the
night
wind
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
rake
drew
the
reins
tight
in
his
hand
in
fury
there
they
come
the
d
d
beaks
for
the
love
of
mercy
sir
check
now
ten
seconds
more
and
they
be
on
you
off
off
or
by
the
lord
harry
sir
you
make
a
murderer
of
me
and
i
kill
the
first
man
that
lays
his
hand
on
you
the
blaze
of
bitter
blood
was
in
the
fiery
face
as
the
moon
shone
on
it
and
he
drew
out
one
of
his
holster
pistols
and
swung
round
in
his
saddle
facing
the
narrow
entrance
of
the
lane
ready
to
shoot
down
the
first
of
the
pursuit
whose
shadow
should
darken
the
broad
stream
of
white
light
that
fell
through
the
archway
cecil
looked
at
him
and
paused
no
more
but
vaulted
into
the
old
familiar
seat
and
forest
king
bore
him
away
through
the
starry
night
with
the
brown
mare
racing
her
best
by
his
side
away
through
the
sleeping
shadows
through
the
broad
beams
of
the
moon
through
the
odorous
scent
of
the
crowded
pines
through
the
soft
breaking
gray
of
the
dawn
away
to
mountain
solitudes
and
forest
silence
and
the
shelter
of
lonely
untracked
ravines
and
the
woodland
lairs
they
must
share
with
wolf
and
boar
away
to
flee
with
the
flight
of
the
hunted
fox
to
race
with
the
wakeful
dread
of
the
deer
away
to
what
fate
who
could
tell
far
and
fast
they
rode
through
the
night
never
drawing
rein
the
horses
laid
well
to
their
work
their
youth
and
their
mettle
were
roused
and
they
needed
no
touch
of
spur
but
dashed
down
through
the
sullen
gray
of
the
dawn
and
the
breaking
flush
of
the
first
sunrise
on
the
hard
parched
earth
on
the
moss
on
the
stretches
of
wayside
sward
on
the
dry
white
dust
of
the
ducal
roads
their
hoofs
thundered
unfollowed
unechoed
the
challenge
of
no
pursuit
stayed
them
and
they
obeyed
the
call
that
was
made
on
their
strength
with
good
and
gallant
willingness
far
and
fast
they
rode
happily
knowing
the
country
well
now
through
the
darkness
of
night
now
through
the
glimmering
daybreak
tall
walls
of
rocks
passed
by
their
eyes
all
fused
and
dim
gray
piles
of
monastic
buildings
with
the
dull
chimes
tolling
the
hour
flashed
on
their
sight
to
be
lost
in
a
moment
yellowing
for
the
sickle
fields
with
the
sheaves
orchards
ruddy
with
fruit
and
black
lost
in
leafy
nests
villages
lying
among
their
hills
like
german
toys
caught
in
the
hollow
of
a
guarding
hand
masses
of
forests
stretching
wide
somber
and
silent
and
dark
as
a
tomb
the
shine
of
water
silvery
line
where
it
flowed
in
a
rocky
channel
they
passed
them
all
in
the
soft
gray
of
the
waning
night
in
the
white
veil
of
the
fragrant
mists
in
the
stillness
of
sleep
and
of
peace
passed
them
racing
for
more
than
life
flying
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
i
failed
him
through
my
foes
and
his
forest
king
thought
as
he
laid
his
length
out
in
his
mighty
stride
but
i
love
him
well
i
will
save
him
and
save
him
the
brave
brute
did
the
grass
was
so
sweet
and
so
short
he
longed
to
stop
for
a
mouthful
the
brooks
looked
so
clear
he
longed
to
pause
for
a
drink
renewed
force
and
reviving
youth
filled
his
loyal
veins
with
their
fire
he
could
have
thrown
himself
down
on
that
mossy
turf
and
had
a
roll
in
its
thyme
and
its
lichens
for
sheer
joy
that
his
strength
had
come
back
but
he
would
yield
to
none
of
these
longings
he
held
on
for
his
master
sake
and
tried
to
think
as
he
ran
that
this
was
only
a
piece
of
play
only
a
for
a
silver
vase
and
a
lady
smile
such
as
he
and
his
rider
had
so
often
run
for
and
so
often
won
in
those
glad
hours
of
the
crisp
winter
noons
of
english
shires
far
away
he
turned
his
eyes
on
the
brown
mare
and
she
turned
hers
on
his
they
were
good
friends
in
the
stables
at
home
and
they
understood
one
another
now
if
i
were
what
i
was
yesterday
she
would
run
even
with
me
thought
the
king
but
they
were
doing
good
work
together
and
he
was
too
true
a
knight
and
too
true
a
gentleman
to
be
jealous
of
mother
o
pearl
so
they
raced
through
the
dawn
with
the
noisy
clatter
of
wheels
or
the
distant
sound
of
a
woodman
ax
or
the
tolling
bell
of
a
convent
clock
the
only
sound
on
the
air
save
the
beat
of
the
flying
hoofs
away
they
went
mile
on
mile
league
on
league
till
the
stars
faded
out
in
the
blaze
of
the
sun
and
the
tall
pines
rose
out
of
the
gloom
either
his
pursuers
were
baffled
and
distanced
or
no
hue
and
cry
was
yet
after
him
nothing
arrested
them
as
they
swept
on
and
the
silent
land
lay
in
the
stillness
of
morning
ere
toil
and
activity
awakened
it
was
strangely
still
strangely
lonely
and
the
echo
of
the
gallop
seemed
to
beat
on
the
stirless
breathless
solitude
as
the
light
broke
and
grew
clearer
and
clearer
cecil
face
in
it
was
white
as
death
as
he
galloped
through
the
mists
a
hunted
man
on
whose
head
a
price
was
set
but
it
was
quite
calm
still
and
very
resolute
there
was
no
harking
back
in
it
they
had
raced
nigh
twenty
english
miles
by
the
time
the
chimes
of
a
village
were
striking
six
it
was
the
only
group
of
dwellings
they
had
ventured
near
in
their
flight
the
leaded
lattices
were
thrust
open
with
a
hasty
clang
and
women
heads
looked
out
as
the
iron
tramp
of
the
hunters
feet
struck
fire
from
the
stones
a
few
cries
were
raised
one
burgher
called
them
to
know
their
errand
they
answered
nothing
but
traversed
the
street
with
lightning
speed
gone
from
sight
almost
ere
they
were
seen
a
league
farther
on
was
a
wooded
bottom
all
dark
and
silent
with
a
brook
murmuring
through
it
under
the
leafy
shade
of
lilies
and
the
tangle
of
there
cecil
checked
the
king
and
threw
himself
out
of
saddle
he
is
not
quite
himself
yet
he
murmured
as
he
loosened
the
girths
and
held
back
the
delicate
head
from
the
perilous
cold
of
the
water
to
which
the
horse
stretched
so
eagerly
he
thought
more
of
forest
king
than
he
thought
even
in
that
hour
of
himself
he
did
all
that
was
needed
with
his
own
hands
fed
him
with
the
corn
from
the
cooled
him
gently
led
him
to
drink
a
cautious
draught
from
the
bubbling
little
stream
then
let
him
graze
and
rest
under
the
shade
of
the
aromatic
pines
and
the
deep
bronze
leaves
of
the
copper
beeches
it
was
almost
dark
so
heavy
and
thickly
laced
were
the
branches
and
exquisitely
tranquil
in
the
heart
of
the
hilly
country
in
the
peace
of
the
early
day
with
the
rushing
of
the
forest
brook
the
sole
sound
that
was
heard
and
the
everlasting
sighing
of
the
overhead
cecil
leaned
a
while
silently
against
one
of
the
great
gnarled
trunks
and
rake
affected
to
busy
himself
with
the
mare
in
his
heart
was
a
tumult
of
rage
a
volcano
of
curiosity
a
storm
of
anxious
amaze
but
he
would
have
let
mother
o
pearl
brain
him
with
a
kick
of
her
iron
plates
rather
than
press
a
single
look
that
should
seem
like
doubt
or
seem
like
insult
in
adversity
to
his
fallen
master
cecil
eyes
drooped
and
brooding
gazed
a
long
down
in
silence
into
the
brook
bubbling
at
his
feet
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
spoke
with
a
certain
formality
and
command
in
his
voice
as
though
he
gave
an
order
on
parade
rake
listen
and
do
precisely
what
i
bid
you
neither
more
nor
less
the
horses
can
not
accompany
me
nor
you
either
i
must
go
henceforth
where
they
would
starve
and
you
would
do
worse
i
do
not
take
the
king
into
suffering
nor
you
into
rake
who
at
the
tone
had
fallen
unconsciously
in
to
the
attitude
of
attention
giving
the
salute
with
his
old
military
instinct
opened
his
lips
to
speak
in
eager
protestation
cecil
put
up
his
hand
i
have
decided
nothing
you
can
say
will
alter
me
we
are
near
a
now
if
i
find
none
there
to
prevent
me
i
shall
get
away
by
the
first
train
to
hide
in
these
woods
is
out
of
the
question
you
will
return
by
easy
stages
to
baden
and
take
the
horses
at
once
to
lord
rockingham
they
are
his
now
tell
him
my
last
wish
was
that
he
should
take
you
into
his
service
and
he
will
be
a
better
master
to
you
than
i
have
ever
been
as
for
the
king
his
lips
quivered
and
his
voice
shook
a
little
despite
himself
he
will
be
safe
with
him
i
shall
go
into
some
foreign
service
austrian
russian
mexican
whichever
be
open
to
me
i
would
not
risk
such
a
horse
as
mine
to
be
sold
tossed
from
owner
to
owner
sent
in
his
old
age
to
a
knacker
yard
or
killed
in
a
skirmish
by
a
take
both
him
and
the
mare
back
and
go
back
yourself
believe
me
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
your
noble
offer
of
fidelity
but
accept
it
i
never
a
dead
pause
came
after
his
words
rake
stood
mute
a
curious
look
but
very
resolute
had
come
on
his
face
cecil
thought
him
pained
and
spoke
with
an
infinite
gentleness
my
good
fellow
do
not
regret
it
or
fancy
i
have
no
gratitude
to
you
i
feel
your
loyalty
deeply
and
i
know
all
you
would
willingly
suffer
for
me
but
it
must
not
be
the
mere
offer
of
what
you
would
do
had
been
quite
testimony
enough
of
your
truth
and
your
worth
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
what
has
so
suddenly
changed
my
fortunes
it
is
sufficient
that
for
the
future
i
shall
be
if
i
live
what
you
were
a
private
soldier
in
an
army
that
needs
a
sword
but
let
my
fate
be
what
it
will
i
go
to
it
alone
spare
me
more
speech
and
simply
obey
my
last
quiet
as
the
words
were
there
was
a
resolve
in
them
not
to
be
disputed
an
authority
not
to
be
rebelled
against
rake
stared
and
looked
at
him
blankly
in
this
man
who
spoke
to
him
with
so
subdued
but
so
irresistible
a
power
of
command
he
could
scarcely
recognize
the
gay
indolent
indulgent
pococurante
guardsman
whose
most
serious
anxiety
had
been
the
set
of
a
lace
tie
the
fashion
of
his
hunting
dress
or
the
choice
of
the
gold
arabesques
for
his
rake
was
silent
a
moment
then
his
hand
touched
his
cap
again
very
well
sir
and
without
opposition
or
entreaty
he
turned
to
resaddle
the
mare
our
natures
are
oddly
inconsistent
cecil
would
not
have
taken
the
man
in
to
exile
and
danger
and
temptation
and
away
from
comfort
and
an
honest
life
for
any
consideration
yet
it
gave
him
something
of
a
pang
that
rake
was
so
soon
dissuaded
from
following
him
and
so
easily
convinced
of
the
folly
of
his
fidelity
but
he
had
dealt
himself
a
far
deadlier
one
when
he
had
resolved
to
part
forever
from
the
king
he
loved
the
horse
better
than
he
loved
anything
fed
from
his
hand
in
foalhood
reared
broken
and
trained
under
his
own
eye
and
his
own
care
he
had
had
a
truer
welcome
from
those
loving
lustrous
eyes
than
all
his
mistresses
ever
gave
him
he
had
had
so
many
victories
so
many
so
many
pleasant
days
of
winter
and
of
autumn
with
forest
king
for
his
comrade
and
companion
he
could
better
bear
to
sever
from
all
other
things
than
from
the
whose
brave
heart
never
failed
him
and
whose
honest
love
was
always
his
he
stretched
his
hand
out
with
his
accustomed
signal
the
king
lifted
his
head
where
he
grazed
and
came
to
him
with
the
murmuring
noise
of
pleasure
he
always
gave
at
his
master
caress
and
pressed
his
forehead
against
cecil
breast
and
took
such
tender
heed
such
earnest
solicitude
not
to
harm
him
with
a
touch
of
the
mighty
fore
hoofs
as
those
only
who
care
for
and
know
horses
well
will
understand
in
its
relation
cecil
threw
his
arm
over
his
neck
and
leaned
his
own
head
down
on
it
so
that
his
face
was
hidden
he
stood
motionless
so
many
moments
and
the
king
never
stirred
but
only
pressed
closer
and
closer
against
his
bosom
as
though
he
knew
that
this
was
his
eternal
farewell
to
his
master
but
little
light
came
there
the
boughs
grew
so
thickly
and
it
was
still
and
solitary
as
a
desert
in
the
gloom
of
the
meeting
trees
there
have
been
many
idols
idols
of
gold
idols
of
clay
less
pure
less
true
than
the
brave
and
beast
from
whom
he
parted
now
he
stood
motionless
a
while
longer
and
where
his
face
was
hidden
the
gray
silken
mane
of
the
horse
was
wet
with
great
slow
tears
that
forced
themselves
through
his
closed
eyes
then
he
laid
his
lips
on
the
forehead
as
he
might
have
touched
the
brow
of
the
woman
he
loved
and
with
a
backward
gesture
of
his
hand
to
his
servant
plunged
down
into
the
deep
slope
of
netted
boughs
and
scarce
penetrable
leafage
that
swung
back
into
their
places
and
shrouded
him
from
sight
with
their
thick
unbroken
screen
he
forgot
me
right
and
away
in
the
king
murmured
rake
as
he
led
forest
king
away
slowly
and
sorrowfully
while
the
hunter
pulled
and
fretted
to
force
his
way
to
his
master
well
it
only
natural
like
i
cause
to
care
for
him
and
plenty
on
it
but
he
ai
no
sort
of
reason
to
think
about
that
was
the
way
the
philosopher
took
his
wound
alone
cecil
flung
himself
down
on
the
turf
beneath
the
beech
woods
his
arms
thrown
forward
his
face
buried
in
the
grass
all
gay
with
late
summer
forest
blossoms
for
the
first
time
the
whole
might
of
the
rain
that
had
fallen
on
him
was
understood
by
him
for
the
first
time
it
beat
him
down
beneath
it
as
the
overstrained
tension
of
nerve
and
of
had
their
inevitable
reaction
he
knew
what
this
thing
was
which
he
had
done
he
had
given
up
his
whole
future
though
he
had
spoken
lightly
to
his
servant
of
his
intention
to
enter
a
foreign
army
he
knew
himself
how
few
the
chances
were
that
he
could
ever
do
so
it
was
possible
that
rockingham
might
so
exert
his
influence
that
he
would
be
left
unpursued
but
unless
this
chanced
so
and
baroni
had
seemed
resolute
to
forego
no
part
of
his
demands
the
search
for
him
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
law
and
the
wiles
of
secret
police
and
of
detectives
resources
spread
too
far
and
finely
over
the
world
for
him
to
have
a
hope
of
ultimate
escape
if
he
sought
france
the
extradition
treaty
would
deliver
him
up
russia
austria
prussia
were
of
equal
danger
he
would
be
identified
and
given
up
to
trial
into
the
italian
service
he
knew
many
a
scoundrel
was
received
unquestioned
and
he
might
try
the
western
world
though
he
had
no
means
to
pay
the
passage
he
might
work
it
he
was
a
good
sailor
yachts
had
been
twice
sunk
under
him
by
steamers
in
the
solent
and
the
spezzia
and
his
own
schooner
had
once
been
fired
at
by
mistake
for
a
blockade
runner
when
he
had
brought
to
and
given
them
a
broadside
from
his
two
shotted
guns
before
he
would
signal
them
their
error
as
these
things
swept
disordered
and
aimless
through
his
mind
he
wondered
if
a
nightmare
were
upon
him
he
the
darling
of
belgravia
the
guards
champion
the
lover
of
lady
guenevere
to
be
here
outlawed
and
friendless
wearily
racking
his
brains
to
solve
whether
he
had
seamanship
enough
to
be
taken
before
the
mast
or
could
stand
before
the
of
a
french
regiment
with
a
chance
to
serve
the
same
flag
for
a
while
he
lay
like
a
drunken
man
heavy
and
motionless
his
brow
resting
on
his
arm
his
face
buried
in
the
grass
he
had
parted
more
easily
with
the
woman
he
loved
than
he
had
parted
with
forest
king
the
chimes
of
some
monastery
or
swung
lazily
in
the
morning
stillness
the
sound
revived
him
and
recalled
to
him
how
little
time
there
was
if
he
would
seek
the
flight
that
had
begun
on
impulse
and
was
continued
in
a
firm
unshrinking
resolve
he
must
go
on
and
on
and
on
he
must
burrow
like
a
fox
hide
like
a
beaten
cur
he
must
put
leagues
between
him
and
all
who
had
ever
known
him
he
must
sink
his
very
name
and
identity
and
existence
under
some
impenetrable
obscurity
or
the
burden
he
had
taken
up
for
others
sake
would
be
uselessly
borne
there
must
be
action
of
some
sort
or
other
instant
and
unerring
it
do
matter
he
thought
with
the
old
idle
indifference
oddly
becoming
in
that
extreme
moment
the
very
height
of
stoic
philosophy
without
any
thought
or
effort
to
be
such
i
was
going
to
the
bad
of
my
own
accord
i
must
have
cut
and
run
for
the
debts
if
not
for
this
it
would
have
been
the
same
thing
anyway
so
it
just
as
well
to
do
it
for
them
life
over
and
i
a
fool
that
i
do
shoot
but
there
was
too
imperious
a
spirit
in
the
royallieu
blood
to
let
him
give
in
to
disaster
and
do
this
he
rose
slowly
staggering
a
little
and
feeling
blinded
and
dazzled
with
the
blaze
of
the
morning
sun
as
he
went
out
of
the
beech
wood
there
were
the
marks
of
the
hoofs
on
the
damp
dewy
turf
his
lips
trembled
a
little
as
he
saw
them
he
would
never
rid
the
horse
again
some
two
miles
more
or
less
lay
between
him
and
the
railway
he
was
not
certain
of
his
way
and
he
felt
a
sickening
exhaustion
on
him
he
had
been
without
food
since
his
breakfast
before
the
race
a
gamekeeper
hut
stood
near
the
entrance
of
the
wood
he
had
much
recklessness
in
him
and
no
caution
he
entered
through
the
door
and
asked
the
keeper
who
was
eating
his
sausage
and
drinking
his
lager
for
a
meal
i
give
you
one
if
you
bring
me
down
that
growled
the
man
in
south
german
pointing
to
the
bird
that
was
sailing
far
off
a
mere
speck
in
the
sunny
sky
cecil
took
the
rifle
held
out
to
him
and
without
seeming
even
to
pause
to
take
aim
fired
the
bird
dropped
like
a
stone
through
the
air
into
the
distant
woods
there
was
no
tremor
in
his
wrist
no
uncertainty
in
his
measure
the
keeper
stared
the
shot
was
one
he
had
thought
beyond
any
man
range
and
he
set
food
and
drink
before
his
guest
with
a
crestfallen
surprise
oddly
mingled
with
veneration
you
might
have
let
me
buy
my
breakfast
without
making
me
do
murder
said
bertie
quietly
as
he
tried
to
eat
the
meal
was
coarse
he
could
scarcely
touch
it
but
he
drank
the
beer
down
thirstily
and
took
a
crust
of
bread
he
slipped
his
ring
a
great
sapphire
graven
with
his
crest
off
his
finger
and
held
it
out
to
the
man
that
is
worth
fifty
will
you
take
it
in
exchange
for
your
rifle
and
some
powder
and
ball
the
german
stared
again
and
clinched
the
bargain
eagerly
he
did
not
know
anything
about
gems
but
the
splendor
of
this
dazzled
his
eye
while
he
had
guns
more
than
enough
and
could
get
many
others
at
his
lord
cost
cecil
fastened
a
round
him
took
a
and
and
with
a
few
words
of
thanks
went
on
his
way
now
that
he
held
the
rifle
in
his
hand
he
felt
ready
for
the
work
that
was
before
him
if
hunted
to
bay
at
any
rate
he
could
now
have
a
struggle
for
his
liberty
the
keeper
stood
bewildered
gazing
blankly
after
him
down
the
vista
of
pines
hein
hein
he
growled
as
he
looked
at
the
sapphire
sparkling
in
his
broad
brown
palm
i
never
saw
such
a
gentleman
i
wish
i
had
not
let
him
have
the
gun
he
will
take
his
own
life
belikes
ach
gott
he
will
take
his
own
life
but
cecil
had
not
bought
it
for
that
end
though
he
had
called
himself
a
fool
for
not
sending
a
bullet
through
his
brain
to
quench
in
eternal
darkness
this
ruined
and
wretched
life
that
alone
remained
to
him
he
walked
on
through
the
still
summer
dawn
with
the
width
of
the
country
stretching
around
him
the
sleeplessness
the
excitement
the
misery
the
wild
running
of
the
past
night
had
left
him
strengthless
and
racked
with
pain
but
he
knew
that
he
must
press
onward
or
be
caught
sooner
or
later
like
netted
game
in
the
poacher
silken
mesh
where
to
go
what
to
do
he
knew
no
more
than
if
he
were
a
child
everything
had
always
been
ready
to
his
hand
the
only
thought
required
of
him
had
been
how
to
amuse
himself
and
avoid
being
bored
now
thrown
alone
on
a
mighty
calamity
and
brought
face
to
face
with
the
severity
and
emergency
of
exertion
he
was
like
a
beaten
under
high
billows
and
driven
far
out
to
sea
by
the
madness
of
a
raging
he
had
no
conception
what
to
do
he
had
but
one
resolve
to
keep
his
secret
if
to
do
it
he
killed
himself
with
the
rifle
his
sapphire
ring
had
bought
carelessly
daring
always
he
sauntered
now
into
the
station
for
which
he
had
made
without
a
sign
on
him
that
could
attract
observation
he
wore
still
the
violet
velvet
dress
the
hessians
and
the
felt
hat
with
an
eagle
feather
fastened
in
it
that
he
had
worn
at
the
races
and
with
the
gun
in
his
hand
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
him
from
any
tourist
milor
except
that
in
one
hand
he
carried
his
own
valise
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
no
warrant
for
his
apprehension
no
announcement
of
his
personal
appearance
had
preceded
him
here
he
was
safe
safe
in
that
safer
still
in
the
fact
that
the
train
rushed
in
so
immediately
on
his
arrival
there
that
the
few
people
about
had
no
time
to
notice
or
speculate
upon
him
the
coupe
was
empty
by
a
happy
chance
he
took
it
throwing
his
money
down
with
no
heed
that
when
the
little
he
had
left
was
once
expended
he
would
be
penniless
and
the
train
whirled
on
with
him
plunging
into
the
heart
of
forest
and
mountain
and
the
black
gloom
of
tunnels
and
the
golden
seas
of
he
was
alone
and
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
and
thought
and
thought
and
thought
till
the
rocking
and
the
rushing
and
the
whirl
and
the
noise
of
the
steam
on
his
ear
and
the
giddy
gyrations
of
his
brain
in
the
exhaustion
of
overstrung
exertion
conquered
thought
with
the
beating
of
the
engine
seeming
to
throb
like
the
great
swinging
of
a
pendulum
through
his
mind
and
the
whirling
of
the
country
passing
by
him
like
a
confused
phantasmagoria
his
eyes
closed
his
aching
limbs
stretched
themselves
out
to
rest
a
heavy
dreamless
sleep
fell
on
him
the
sleep
of
intense
bodily
fatigue
and
he
knew
no
more
gendarmes
awoke
him
to
see
his
visa
he
showed
it
them
by
sheer
mechanical
instinct
and
slept
again
in
that
dead
weight
of
slumber
the
moment
he
was
alone
when
he
had
taken
his
ticket
and
they
had
asked
him
to
where
it
should
be
he
had
answered
to
their
amaze
to
the
farthest
place
it
goes
and
he
was
borne
on
now
unwitting
where
it
went
through
the
rich
champaign
and
the
barren
plains
through
the
reddening
vintage
and
over
the
dreary
plateaux
through
antique
cities
and
across
broad
flowing
rivers
through
the
cave
of
riven
rocks
and
above
nestling
leafy
valleys
on
and
on
on
and
on
while
he
knew
nothing
as
the
sleep
of
intense
weariness
held
him
in
it
stupor
he
awoke
at
last
with
a
start
it
was
evening
the
stilly
twilight
was
settling
over
all
the
land
and
the
train
was
still
rushing
onward
fleet
as
the
wind
his
eyes
as
they
opened
dreamily
fell
on
a
face
half
obscured
in
the
gleaming
he
leaned
forward
bewildered
and
doubting
his
senses
rake
rake
gave
the
salute
hurriedly
and
in
embarrassment
it
i
sir
yes
cecil
thought
himself
dreaming
still
you
you
had
my
orders
yes
sir
i
had
your
orders
murmured
the
more
confused
than
he
had
ever
been
in
the
whole
course
of
his
audacious
life
and
they
was
the
first
i
ever
disobeyed
they
was
you
see
sir
they
was
just
what
i
could
swallow
nohow
that
the
real
fact
send
me
to
the
devil
cecil
for
you
and
i
go
at
the
first
bidding
but
leave
you
just
when
things
are
on
the
cross
for
you
damn
me
if
i
will
beggin
your
pardon
sir
and
rake
growing
fiery
and
eloquent
dashed
his
cap
down
on
the
floor
of
the
coupe
with
an
emphatic
declaration
of
resistance
cecil
looked
at
him
in
silence
he
was
not
certain
still
whether
this
were
not
a
fantastic
folly
he
was
dreaming
damn
me
if
i
will
cecil
you
wo
keep
me
very
well
but
you
ca
prevent
me
follerin
of
you
and
foller
you
i
will
and
so
no
more
to
be
said
about
it
sir
but
just
to
let
me
have
my
own
lark
as
one
may
say
you
said
you
go
to
the
station
i
went
there
you
took
your
ticket
i
took
my
ticket
i
been
travelling
behind
you
till
about
two
hours
ago
then
i
looked
at
you
you
was
asleep
sir
think
my
master
quite
well
says
i
to
guard
like
to
get
in
there
along
of
him
in
with
you
then
says
he
only
we
was
jabbering
that
willainous
tongue
o
theirs
for
he
sees
the
name
on
my
traps
is
the
same
as
that
on
your
traps
and
in
i
get
now
cecil
let
me
say
one
word
for
all
and
do
think
i
a
insolent
for
having
been
and
gone
and
disobeyed
you
but
you
was
good
to
me
when
i
was
sore
in
want
of
it
you
was
even
good
to
my
dog
rest
his
soul
the
poor
beast
there
never
were
a
braver
and
stick
to
you
i
will
till
you
kick
me
away
like
a
cur
the
truth
is
only
being
near
of
you
sir
that
keeps
me
straight
if
i
was
to
leave
you
i
should
become
a
bad
again
right
and
away
do
send
me
from
you
sir
as
you
took
mercy
on
me
once
rake
voice
shook
a
little
toward
the
close
of
his
harangue
and
in
the
shadows
of
evening
light
as
the
train
plunged
through
the
gathering
gloom
his
ruddy
bright
bronzed
face
looked
very
pale
and
wistful
cecil
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
in
silence
that
spoke
better
than
words
rank
hung
his
head
no
sir
you
a
gentleman
and
i
been
an
awful
scamp
it
enough
honor
for
me
that
you
would
do
it
when
i
more
worth
it
perhaps
but
that
wo
never
you
are
worth
it
now
my
gallant
his
voice
was
very
low
the
man
loyalty
touched
him
keenly
it
was
only
for
yourself
rake
that
i
ever
wished
you
to
leave
god
bless
you
sir
said
rake
passionately
them
words
are
better
nor
ten
tosses
of
brandy
you
see
sir
i
so
spry
and
happy
in
a
wild
life
i
am
and
if
so
be
as
you
go
to
them
american
parts
as
you
spoke
on
why
i
know
just
as
well
as
i
know
newmarket
heath
every
bit
they
terrible
rips
in
them
parts
kill
you
as
soon
as
look
at
you
it
makes
things
uncommon
larky
out
there
uncommon
spicy
you
are
never
sure
but
what
there
a
bowie
knife
for
with
which
view
of
the
delights
of
western
life
rake
feeling
like
a
fool
as
he
thought
himself
for
which
reason
he
had
diverged
into
argentine
memories
applied
himself
to
the
touching
and
examining
of
the
rifle
with
that
tenderness
which
only
gunnery
love
and
lore
produce
cecil
sat
silent
a
while
his
head
drooped
down
on
his
hands
while
the
evening
deepened
to
night
at
last
he
looked
up
the
king
where
is
he
rake
flushed
shamefacedly
under
his
tanned
skin
beggin
your
pardon
sir
behind
behind
me
yes
sir
him
and
the
brown
mare
i
could
do
nothing
else
with
you
see
sir
so
i
shipped
him
along
with
us
they
do
care
for
the
train
a
bit
bless
their
hearts
and
i
got
a
sharp
boy
of
you
can
easily
send
on
to
england
from
paris
if
determined
to
part
with
but
you
know
the
king
always
was
fond
of
drums
and
trumpets
and
that
like
you
remember
sir
when
he
as
a
colt
we
broke
him
into
it
and
taught
him
a
bit
of
maneuvering
till
you
find
what
pace
he
had
in
him
you
thought
of
making
a
charger
of
him
he
loves
the
noise
of
soldiering
he
do
and
if
he
thought
you
was
going
away
without
him
he
break
his
heart
cecil
sir
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
him
from
follerin
of
you
this
morning
he
sawed
my
arms
off
with
which
rake
conscious
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
unpardonable
disobedience
and
outrageous
interference
hung
his
head
over
the
gun
a
little
anxious
and
a
good
deal
ashamed
cecil
smiled
a
little
despite
himself
rake
you
will
do
for
no
service
i
am
afraid
you
are
terribly
insubordinate
he
had
not
the
heart
to
say
more
the
man
fidelity
was
too
true
to
be
returned
with
rebuke
and
stronger
than
all
surprise
and
annoyance
was
a
strange
mingling
of
pain
and
pleasure
in
him
to
think
that
the
horse
he
loved
so
well
was
still
so
near
him
the
comrade
of
his
adversity
as
he
had
been
the
companion
of
his
happiest
hours
these
things
will
keep
him
a
few
days
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
his
and
the
priceless
pearl
in
each
of
his
he
would
have
pawned
every
atom
he
had
about
him
to
have
had
the
king
with
him
a
week
longer
the
night
fell
the
stars
came
out
the
of
a
coming
tempest
drifted
over
the
sky
the
train
rushed
onward
through
the
thickening
darkness
through
the
spectral
country
it
was
like
his
life
rushing
headlong
down
into
impenetrable
gloom
the
best
the
uttermost
that
he
could
look
for
was
a
soldier
grave
far
away
under
some
foreign
soil
a
few
evenings
later
the
countess
guenevere
stood
alone
in
her
own
boudoir
in
her
baden
suite
she
was
going
to
dine
with
an
archduchess
of
russia
and
the
splendid
jewels
of
her
house
glittered
through
the
black
shower
of
her
laces
and
crowned
her
beautiful
glossy
hair
her
delicate
imperial
head
in
her
hands
was
a
letter
oddly
written
in
pencil
on
a
leaf
torn
out
of
a
betting
book
but
without
a
tremor
or
a
change
in
the
writing
itself
and
as
she
stood
a
shiver
shook
her
frame
in
the
solitude
of
her
lighted
and
luxurious
chamber
her
cheek
grew
pale
her
eyes
grew
dim
to
refute
the
charge
ran
the
last
words
of
what
was
at
best
but
a
fragment
i
must
have
broken
my
promise
to
you
and
have
compromised
your
name
keeping
silence
myself
but
letting
the
trial
take
place
so
execrable
and
so
minute
would
soon
have
traced
through
others
that
i
was
with
you
that
evening
to
clear
myself
i
must
have
attainted
your
name
with
public
slander
and
drawn
the
horrible
ordeal
on
you
before
the
world
let
me
be
thought
guilty
it
matters
little
henceforth
i
shall
be
dead
to
all
who
know
me
and
my
ruin
would
have
exiled
me
without
this
do
not
let
an
hour
of
grief
for
me
mar
your
peace
my
dearest
think
of
me
with
no
pain
beatrice
only
with
some
memory
of
our
past
love
i
have
not
strength
yet
to
say
forget
me
and
yet
if
it
be
for
your
happiness
blot
out
from
your
remembrance
all
thought
of
what
we
have
been
to
one
another
all
thought
of
me
and
of
my
life
save
to
remember
now
and
then
that
i
was
dear
to
the
words
grew
indistinct
before
her
sight
they
touched
the
heart
of
the
coquette
of
the
victorious
sovereign
to
the
core
she
trembled
greatly
as
she
read
them
for
in
her
hands
was
his
fate
though
no
hint
of
this
was
breathed
in
his
farewell
letter
she
knew
that
with
a
word
she
could
clear
him
free
him
and
call
him
back
from
exile
and
shame
give
him
once
more
honor
and
guiltlessness
in
the
sight
of
the
world
with
a
word
she
could
do
this
his
life
was
in
the
balance
that
she
held
as
utterly
as
though
it
were
now
hers
to
sign
or
to
destroy
his
it
rested
with
her
to
speak
and
to
say
he
had
no
guilt
but
to
do
this
she
must
sacrifice
herself
she
stood
mute
irresolute
a
shudder
running
through
her
till
her
diamonds
shook
in
the
light
the
heavy
tears
stole
slowly
down
one
by
one
and
fell
upon
the
blurred
and
blackened
paper
her
heart
ached
with
an
exceeding
bitterness
then
shudderingly
still
and
as
though
there
were
a
coward
crime
in
the
action
her
hand
unclosed
and
let
the
letter
fall
into
the
spirit
flame
of
a
silver
lamp
burning
by
the
words
that
were
upon
it
merited
a
better
fate
a
fonder
cherishing
but
they
would
have
compromised
her
she
let
them
fall
and
burn
and
wither
with
them
she
gave
up
his
life
to
its
burden
of
shame
to
its
fate
of
exile
she
would
hear
his
crime
condemned
and
her
lips
would
not
open
she
would
hear
his
name
aspersed
and
her
voice
would
not
be
raised
she
would
know
that
he
dwelt
in
misery
or
died
under
foreign
suns
unhonored
and
unmourned
while
tongues
around
her
would
babble
of
his
disgrace
and
she
would
keep
her
peace
she
loved
him
yes
but
she
loved
better
the
dignity
in
which
the
world
held
her
and
the
diamonds
from
which
the
law
would
divorce
her
if
their
love
were
known
she
sacrificed
him
for
her
reputation
and
her
jewels
the
choice
was
thoroughly
a
woman

its

at

with

a

was
drinking
absinthe

old

in

comparative
silence
that
had
succeeded

sung
by
a
certain
favorite
of
the
spahis
known
as
soucie

from
mlle
habits
of
independence
and
bravado
which
last
had
gone
once
so
far
as
shooting
a
man
through
the
chest
in

and
setting
all
the

and
at
defiance
afterward
half
a
dozen
of
that
famous
regiment
the

were
gathered
together
some
with
their
feet
resting
on
the
little
tables
some
reading
the
french
papers
all
smoking
their
inseparable
companions
the
fine
stalwart
fellows
with
faces
and

that
the
glowing
colors
of

set
off
to

advantage
was
in
fine

said

yes
she
took
plenty
of
cognac
before
she
sang
that
always
clears
her
voice
said
a
second
and
i
think
that
did
her
spirits
good
shooting

said
a

by
the
way
did
he

pas
a
good

a

yes
taught
ah
there
never
was
a
shot
like
when
he
went
out
he
always
asked
his
adversary
will
you
like
it
your
lungs
your
heart
your
brain
it
is
quite
a
matter
of
choice
and
whichever
they
chose
he
shot
there
le
pauvre
he
was
always
and
did
he
never
meet
his
match
asked
a
of
the
line
the
speaker
looked
down
on
the
with
superb
contempt
and
twisted
his
mustaches
monsieur
how
could
he
he
was
a
but
if
he
never
met
his
match
how
did
he
die
pursued
the
irreverent
a
little
wiry
man
black
as
a
berry
agile
as
a
monkey
tough
and
short
as
a
the
magnificent
chasseur
laughed
in
his
splendid
disdain
a
never
killed
him
that
i
promise
you
he
spitted
half
a
dozen
of
you
before
breakfast
to
give
him
a
relish
how
did
die
i
will
tell
he
dipped
his
long
mustaches
into
a
beaker
of
still
champagne
claude
viscomte
de
chanrellon
though
in
the
ranks
could
afford
those
luxuries
he
died
this
way
did
dieu
de
dieu
a
very
good
way
too
send
us
all
the
like
when
our
time
comes
we
were
out
yonder
and
he
nodded
his
handsome
head
outward
to
where
the
brown
seared
plateaux
and
the
kabyl
mountains
lay
we
were
hunting
arabs
of
course
rather
as
we
never
got
nigh
enough
to
their
main
body
to
have
a
clear
charge
at
them
grew
sick
of
it
wo
do
he
said
two
weeks
gone
by
and
i
shot
anything
but
kites
and
jackals
i
shall
get
my
hand
out
for
as
the
army
knows
somehow
or
other
generally
potted
his
man
every
day
and
he
missed
it
terribly
well
what
did
he
do
he
rode
off
one
morning
and
found
out
the
arab
camp
and
he
waved
a
white
flag
for
a
parley
he
did
dismount
but
he
just
faced
the
arabs
and
spoke
to
their
sheik
are
slow
he
said
to
them
have
come
for
a
little
amusement
set
aside
six
of
your
best
warriors
and
fight
them
one
after
another
for
the
honor
of
france
and
a
drink
of
brandy
to
the
conqueror
they
demurred
they
thought
it
unfair
to
him
to
have
six
to
one
he
laughs
have
heard
of
and
you
are
afraid
that
put
their
blood
up
they
said
they
would
fight
him
before
all
his
chasseurs
and
welcome
said
not
a
hair
of
your
beards
shall
be
touched
except
by
me
so
the
bargain
was
made
for
an
hour
before
sunset
that
night
mort
de
dieu
that
was
a
grand
duel
he
dipped
his
long
mustaches
again
into
another
beaker
of
still
talking
was
thirsty
work
the
story
was
well
known
in
all
the
african
army
but
the
having
served
in
china
was
new
to
the
soil
the
general
was
when
he
heard
it
and
half
for
arresting
but
sacre
the
thing
was
done
our
honor
was
involved
he
had
engaged
to
fight
these
men
and
engaged
for
us
to
let
them
go
in
peace
afterward
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
unless
we
had
looked
like
cowards
or
traitors
or
both
there
was
a
wide
level
plateau
in
front
of
our
camp
and
the
hills
were
at
our
backs
a
fine
field
for
the
duello
and
true
to
time
the
arabs
filed
on
to
the
plain
and
fronted
us
in
a
long
line
with
their
standards
and
their
crescents
and
their
cymbals
and
and
all
glittering
and
sounding
sac
a
papier
there
was
a
show
and
we
could
not
fight
one
of
them
we
were
drawn
up
in
line
horse
foot
and
artillery
all
alone
some
way
in
advance
mounted
of
course
the
general
and
the
sheik
had
a
conference
then
the
play
began
there
were
six
arabs
picked
out
the
flower
of
the
army
all
white
and
scarlet
and
in
their
handsomest
bravery
as
if
they
came
to
an
aouda
they
were
fine
men
diable
they
were
fine
men
now
the
duel
was
to
be
with
swords
these
had
been
selected
and
each
arab
was
to
come
against
singly
in
succession
our
drums
rolled
the
pas
de
charge
and
their
cymbals
clashed
they
shouted
and
the
first
arab
rode
at
him
sat
like
a
rock
and
lunge
went
his
steel
through
the
bedouin
lung
before
you
could
cry
hola
a
of
course
always
killed
that
was
his
perfect
science
another
and
another
and
another
came
just
as
fast
as
the
blood
flowed
you
know
what
the
arabs
are
vous
autres
how
they
wheel
and
swerve
and
fight
flying
and
pick
up
their
saber
from
the
ground
while
their
horse
is
galloping
ventre
a
terre
and
pierce
you
here
and
pierce
you
there
and
circle
round
you
like
so
many
hawks
you
know
how
they
fought
then
one
after
another
more
like
devils
than
men
mort
de
dieu
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
he
was
gashed
here
and
gashed
there
but
they
could
never
unseat
him
try
how
they
would
and
one
after
another
he
caught
them
sooner
or
later
and
sent
them
reeling
out
of
their
saddles
till
there
was
a
great
red
lake
of
blood
all
round
him
and
five
of
them
lay
dead
or
dying
down
in
the
sand
he
had
mounted
afresh
twice
three
horses
had
been
killed
underneath
him
and
his
jacket
all
hung
in
strips
where
the
steel
had
slashed
it
it
was
grand
to
see
and
did
one
heart
good
but
ventre
bleu
how
one
longed
to
go
in
too
there
was
only
one
left
now
a
young
arab
the
sheik
son
and
down
he
came
like
the
wind
he
thought
with
the
shock
to
unhorse
and
finish
him
then
at
his
leisure
you
could
hear
the
crash
as
they
met
like
two
huge
cymbals
smashing
together
their
chargers
hit
and
tore
at
each
other
manes
they
were
twined
in
together
there
as
if
they
were
but
one
man
and
one
beast
they
shook
and
they
swayed
and
they
rocked
the
sabers
played
about
their
heads
so
quick
that
it
was
like
lightning
as
they
flashed
and
twirled
in
the
sun
the
hoofs
trampled
up
the
sand
till
a
yellow
cloud
hid
their
struggle
and
out
of
it
all
you
could
see
was
the
head
of
a
horse
tossing
up
and
spouting
with
foam
or
a
lifted
to
strike
then
the
tawny
cloud
settled
down
a
little
the
sand
mist
cleared
away
the
arab
saddle
was
empty
but
sat
like
a
rock
the
old
chief
bowed
his
head
is
over
allah
is
great
and
he
knew
his
son
lay
there
dead
then
we
broke
from
the
ranks
and
we
rushed
to
the
place
where
the
chargers
and
men
were
piled
like
so
many
slaughtered
sheep
laughed
such
a
gay
ringing
laugh
as
the
desert
never
had
heard
la
france
he
cried
now
bring
me
my
toss
of
brandy
then
down
headlong
out
of
his
stirrups
he
reeled
and
fell
under
his
horse
and
when
we
lifted
him
up
there
were
two
broken
buried
in
him
and
the
blood
was
pouring
fast
as
water
out
of
thirty
wounds
and
more
that
was
how
died
laughing
to
the
last
sacre
bleu
it
was
a
splendid
end
i
wish
i
were
sure
of
the
and
claude
de
chanrellon
drank
down
his
third
beaker
for
overmuch
speech
made
him
thirsty
the
men
around
him
emptied
their
glasses
in
honor
of
the
dead
hero
was
a
they
said
solemnly
with
almost
a
sigh
so
tendering
by
their
words
the
highest
funeral
oration
you
have
much
of
such
sharp
service
here
i
suppose
asked
a
voice
in
very
pure
french
the
speaker
was
leaning
against
the
open
door
of
the
cafe
a
tall
lightly
built
man
dressed
in
a
velvet
shooting
tunic
much
the
worse
for
wind
and
weather
a
loose
shirt
and
splashed
and
worn
out
when
we
are
at
it
monsieur
returned
the
chasseur
i
only
wish
we
had
of
course
are
you
in
need
of
recruits
they
all
want
to
come
to
us
and
to
the
zouaves
smiled
chanrellon
surveying
the
figure
of
the
one
who
addressed
him
with
a
keen
sense
of
its
symmetry
and
its
sinew
still
a
good
sword
brings
its
welcome
do
you
ask
seriously
monsieur
the
bearded
arabs
smoking
their
long
pipes
the
little
drowning
his
mortification
in
some
curacoa
the
idlers
reading
the
akbah
or
the
presse
the
chasseurs
lounging
over
their
drink
the
ecarte
players
lost
in
their
game
all
looked
up
at
the
newcomer
they
thought
he
looked
a
likely
wearer
of
the
dead
honors
of
he
did
not
answer
the
question
literally
but
came
over
from
the
doorway
and
seated
himself
at
the
little
marble
table
opposite
claude
leaning
his
elbows
on
it
i
have
a
doubt
he
said
i
am
more
inclined
to
your
dieu
de
dieu
exclaimed
chanrellon
pulling
at
his
tawny
mustaches
a
bold
thing
to
say
before
five
he
smiled
a
little
contemptuously
a
little
amusedly
i
am
not
a
perhaps
but
i
say
what
i
think
with
little
heed
of
my
auditors
chanrellon
bent
his
bright
brown
eyes
curiously
on
him
he
is
a
he
thought
he
is
not
to
be
i
prefer
your
foes
went
on
the
other
quite
quietly
quite
listlessly
as
though
the
glittering
cafe
were
not
full
of
french
soldiers
in
the
first
place
they
are
on
the
losing
side
in
the
second
they
are
the
lords
of
the
soil
in
the
third
they
live
as
free
as
air
and
in
the
fourth
they
have
undoubtedly
the
right
of
the
quarrel
monsieur
cried
the
chasseurs
laying
their
hands
on
their
swords
fiery
as
lions
he
looked
indolently
and
wearily
up
from
under
the
long
lashes
of
his
lids
and
went
on
as
though
they
had
not
spoken
i
will
fight
you
all
if
you
like
as
that
worthy
of
yours
did
but
i
do
think
it
worth
while
he
said
carelessly
where
he
leaned
over
the
marble
table
brawling
bad
style
we
do
do
it
i
was
saying
i
like
your
foes
best
mere
matter
of
taste
no
need
to
quarrel
over
it
that
i
see
i
shall
go
into
their
service
or
into
yours
monsieur
will
you
play
a
game
of
dice
to
decide
decide
but
how
why
this
way
said
the
other
with
the
weary
listlessness
of
one
who
cares
not
two
straws
how
things
turn
if
i
win
i
go
to
the
arabs
if
you
win
i
come
to
your
mort
de
dieu
it
is
a
droll
gambling
murmured
chanrellon
but
if
you
win
do
you
think
we
shall
let
you
go
off
to
our
enemies
pas
si
bete
monsieur
yes
you
will
said
the
other
quietly
men
who
knew
what
honor
meant
enough
to
redeem
pledge
of
safety
to
the
bedouins
will
not
take
advantage
of
an
openly
confessed
and
unarmed
a
murmur
of
ratification
ran
through
his
listeners
chanrellon
swore
a
mighty
oath
pardieu
no
you
are
right
if
you
want
to
go
you
shall
go
hola
there
bring
the
dice
champagne
monsieur
vermouth
cognac
nothing
i
thank
he
leaned
back
with
an
apathetic
indolence
and
indifference
oddly
at
contrast
with
the
injudicious
daring
of
his
words
and
the
rough
campaigning
that
he
sought
the
assembled
chasseurs
eyed
him
curiously
they
liked
his
manner
and
they
resented
his
first
speeches
they
noted
every
particular
about
him
his
delicate
white
hands
his
and
dress
his
fair
aristocratic
features
his
sweeping
abundant
beard
his
careless
cool
tired
reckless
way
and
they
were
uncertain
what
to
make
of
him
the
dice
were
brought
what
stakes
monsieur
asked
chanrellon
ten
napoleons
a
side
and
the
he
set
ten
napoleons
down
on
the
table
they
were
the
only
coins
he
had
in
the
world
it
was
very
characteristic
that
he
risked
them
they
threw
the
main
two
sixes
you
see
he
murmured
with
a
half
smile
the
dice
know
it
is
a
drawn
duel
between
you
and
the
un
drole
un
brave
muttered
chanrellon
and
they
threw
again
the
chasseur
cast
a
five
his
was
a
five
again
the
dice
can
not
make
up
their
minds
said
the
other
listlessly
they
know
you
are
might
and
the
arabs
are
the
frenchmen
laughed
they
could
take
a
jest
and
alone
amid
so
many
of
them
he
was
made
sacred
at
once
by
the
very
length
of
odds
against
him
they
rattled
the
boxes
and
threw
again
chanrellon

ah
he
murmured

and
loses
it

poor
devil
the
chasseur
leaned
across
the
table
with
his
brown
fearless
sunny
eyes
full
of
pleasure
monsieur
never
lament
such
good
fortune
for
france
you
belong
to
us
now
let
me
claim
you
he
bowed
more
gravely
than
he
had
borne
himself
hitherto
you
do
me
much
honor
fortune
has
willed
it
so
one
word
only
in
chanrellon
assented
courteously
as
many
as
you
i
have
a
companion
who
must
be
brigaded
with
me
and
i
must
go
on
active
service
at
with
infinite
pleasure
that
doubtless
can
be
arranged
you
shall
present
yourself
morning
and
for
this
is
not
the
season
here
yet
and
we
are
triste
a
faire
fremir
still
i
can
show
you
a
little
fun
though
it
is
not
paris
but
he
rose
and
bowed
again
i
thank
you
not
you
shall
see
me
at
your
barracks
with
the
ah
ah
monsieur
cried
the
chasseur
eagerly
and
a
little
annoyed
what
warrant
have
we
that
you
will
not
dispute
the
decree
of
the
dice
and
go
off
to
your
favorites
the
arabs
he
turned
back
and
looked
full
in
chanrellon
face
his
own
eyes
a
little
surprised
and
infinitely
weary
what
warrant
my
then
without
another
syllable
he
lounged
slowly
out
through
the
soldiers
and
the
idlers
and
disappeared
in
the
confused
din
and
of
the
street
without
through
the
press
of
troopers
grisettes
merchants
beggars
curacoa
sellers
gaunt
bedouins
negro
boys
shrieking
muleteers
laughing

and

that
is
done
he
murmured
to
his
own
thoughts
now
for
life
under
another
flag
claude
de
chanrellon
sat
mute
and
amazed
a
while
gazing
at
the
open
door
then
he
drank
a
fourth
beaker
of
champagne
and
flung
the
emptied
glass
down
with
a
mighty
crash

before

it
was
in

messroom
of
a
certain
famous
light
cavalry
regiment
who
bear
the
reputation
of
being
the
fastest
corps
in
the
english
service
of
a
truth
they
do
plunge
a
little
too
wildly
and
stories
are
told
of
bets
over
ecarte
in
their
anteroom
that
have
been
prompt
extinction
forever
and
aye
to
the
losers
for
they
rarely
play

down
their
stakes
are
too
high
and
moderate
fortunes
may
go
in
a
night
with
the
other
convenient

fatal
system
but
this
one
indiscretion
apart
they
are
a
model
corps
for
blood
for
dash
for
perfect

accord
for
the
finest
horseflesh
in
the
kingdom
and
the

a
couple
of
hundred
hunters
all
in
all
in
their
stalls
were
showing
the
ridings
that
they
could
go
like
birds
and
were
using
up
their
second
horses
with
every
day
out
in
the
first
of
the
season
a
cracker
over
the
best
of

with

and
ainsty
that
had
given
two
things
quick
as
lightning
and
both
closed
with
a
kill
had
filled
the
day
and
they
were
dining
with
a
fair
quantity
of
county
guests
and
all
the
splendor
of
plate
and
ceremony
and
magnificent
hospitalities
which
characterize
those
beaux
sabreurs
wheresoever
they
go
at
one
part
of
the
table
a
discussion
was
going
on
but
they
drank
singularly
little
it
was
not
their
form
ever
to
indulge
in
that
way
and
the
chief
as
dashing
a
sabreur
as
ever
crossed
a
saddle
though
lenient
to
looseness
in
all
other
matters
and
very
young
for
his
command
would
have
been
down

any

of
the
story
said
one
of
the
guests
a
hunting
baronet
and
it
something
very
dark
is
it
very
dark
assented
a
tall
handsome
man
with
a
habitual
air
of
the
most
utterly
exhausted
apathy
ever
attained
by
the
human
features
but
who
nevertheless
had
been
christened
by
the
fiercest
of
the
warrior

of
the

as

by

my

he
paid
those

so

a

took

yes
nothing
could

conclusive
certainly
assented
the
baronet
resignedly
convinced
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
under
the
unfortunate
circumstances
so
lord
royallieu
thinks
i
suppose
he
allowed
no
one
to
wear
mourning
and
had
his
unhappy
portrait
taken
down
and
how
melodramatic
reflected
leo
charteris
now
what
the
deuce
can
it
hurt
a
dead
man
to
have
his
portrait
made
into
a
bonfire
old
lord
always
did
hate
beauty
though
rock
does
all
the
mourning
he
cut
up
no
end
never
saw
a
fellow
so
knocked
out
of
time
vowed
at
first
sell
out
and
go
into
the
austrian
service
swore
he
could
stay
in
the
household
but
would
get

of
some

be
changed

up
to
what
pulteney
jimmy
or

oh
the

jimmy
would
have
known
better
these
new
men
never
know
anything
purchased
that
famous
of

did
you

just
looks

over
such
a

by
george
received
forest
king
as
my
dead
friend
last
gift
pulteney
never
takes
the
hint
not
he
on
he
blunders
if
you
were
inclined
to
part
with
him
i
want
a
good
new
hunting
strain
with
plenty
of
fencing
power
and
i
take
him
for
the
stud
at
any
figure
you
liked
i
thought
the
seraph
would
have
knocked
him
down
i
did
upon
my
honor
he
was
red
as
this
wine
in
a
second
with
rage
and
then
as
white
as
a
woman
are
quite
right
he
says
quietly
and
i
swear
each
word
cut
like
a
bullet
do
want
a
new
strain
with
something
like
breeding
in
it
but
i
hardly
think
you
get
it
for
the
three
next
generations
you
must
learn
to
know
what
it
means
first
then
away

the
story
poor
beauty
said
the
dauphin
he
have
enjoyed
that
he
always
put
down
pulteney
himself
i
remember
his
telling
me
he
was
on
duty
at
windsor
once
when
pulteney
was
staying
there
pulteney
always
horribly
funked
at
court
frightened
out
of
his
life
when
he
dines
with
any
royalties
makes
an
awful
figure
too
in
a
public
ceremony
ca
walk
backward
for
any
money
and
at
his
first
levee
tumbled
down
right
in
the
queen
face
now
at
the
castle
one
night
he
just
happened
to
come
down
a
corridor
as
beauty
was
smoking
beauty
made
believe
to
take
him
for
a
servant
took
out
a
sovereign
and
tossed
it
to
him
keep
a
still
tongue
about
my
cigar
my
good
fellow
pulteney
turned
hot
and
cold
and
stammered
out
god
knows
what
about
his
mighty
dignity
being
mistaken
for
a
valet
bertie
just
laughed
a
little
ever
so
softly
your
pardon
thought
you
were
one
of
the
people
would
have
done
it
for
worlds
i
know
you
never
at
ease
with
a
sovereign
now
pulteney
was
likely
to
forget
that
if
he
wanted
the
king
i
lay
any
money
it
was
to
give
him
to
some
wretched
mount
who
break
his
back
over
a
fence
in
a
selling
well
he
wo
have
him
seraph
do
intend
to
have
the
horse
ever
ridden
or
hunted
at
nonsense
by
jove
he
means
it
nobody
to
cross
the
king
back
he
wants
himself
you
know
and
precious
strong
ones
too
the
king
put
in
stud
at
lyonnesse
poor
bertie
nobody
ever
managed
a
close
finish
as
he
did
at
the
grand
national
last
but
two
do
you
remember
yes
waited
so
beautifully
on
and
shot
by
him
like
lightning
just
before
the
pity
he
went
to
the
bad
ah
what
a
hand
he
played
at
ecarte
the
very
best
of
the
french
but
reckless
at
whist
a
wild
game
there
uncommonly
wild
drove
cis
delareux
half
mad
one
night
at
royallieu
with
the
way
he
threw
his
trumps
out
old
cis
dashed
his
cards
down
at
last
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
do
you
know
or
do
you
not
know
that
a
is
not
to
be
taken
as
you
take
a
timber
in
a
on
the
principle
of
clear
it
or
smash
it
said
bertie
it
or
smash
it
is
a
very
good
rule
for
anything
but
a
trifle
too
energetic
for
me
the
deuce
he
had
enough
of
at
last
i
wish
he
had
come
to
grief
in
that
style
it
a
shocking
bore
for
the
guards
such
an
ugly
it
was
uncommonly
like
him
to
get
killed
just
when
he
did
best
possible
only
thing
he
could
better
taste
would
have
been
to
do
it
earlier
i
always
wondered
he
stopped
for
the
oh
never
thought
it
would
turn
up
trusted
to
a
he
whom
the
punjaub
knew
as
the
sword
of
the
evil
one
but
who
held
in
polite
society
the
title
of
lord
kergenven
drank
some
hock
slowly
and
murmured
as
his
sole
quota
to
the
conversation
very
lazily
and
languidly
bet
you
he
is
dead
at
the
deuce
you
do
and
why
chorused
the
table
when
a
fellow
found
with
all
his
traps
round
him
i
do
believe
he
dead
murmured
kergenven
with
closed
slumberous
eyes
but
why
have
you
heard
anything
not
a
why
do
you
say
he
alive
then
my
lord
lifted
his
brows
ever
so
little
i
think
so
that
but
you
must
have
a
reason
ker
badgered
into
speech
kergenven
drank
a
little
more
hock
and
dropped
out
slowly
in
the
mellowest
voice
in
the
world
the
following
it
do
follow
one
has
reasons
for
anything
pray
do
get
logical
two
years
ago
i
was
out
in
a
chasse
au
sanglier
central
france
perhaps
you
do
know
their
work
it
uncommonly
queer
break
up
the
alps
into
little
bits
scatter
over
a
great
forest
and
then
set
a
killing
pack
to
hunt
through
and
through
it
delightful
chance
for
coming
to
grief
even
odds
that
if
you
do
pitch
down
a
ravine
get
blinded
for
life
by
a
branch
that
if
you
do
get
flattened
under
a
boulder
you
be
shot
by
a
twig
catching
your
uncommonly
good
exhausted
with
so
lengthened
an
exposition
of
the
charms
of
the
venerie
and
the
hallali
he
stopped
and
dropped
a
walnut
into
some
regency
sherry
hang
it
ker
cried
the
dauphin
what
that
to
do
with
beauty
my
lord
let
fall
a
sleepy
glance
of
surprise
and
of
rebuke
from
under
his
black
lashes
that
said
mutely
do
i
who
hate
talking
ever
talk
wide
of
any
point
why
this
he
murmured
he
was
with
us
down
at
louis
place
you
know
and
we
were
out
after
an
old
boar
not
too
old
to
race
but
still
tough
enough
to
be
likely
to
turn
and
trust
to
his
tusks
if
the
pace
got
very
hot
and
he
was
hard
pressed
at
the
finish
we
had
found
till
rather
late
the
limeurs
were
rather
new
to
the
work
and
the
november
day
was
short
of
course
the
pack
got
on
the
slot
of
a
roebuck
too
and
were
off
the
boar
scent
in
a
little
while
running
wild
altogether
we
got
scattered
and
in
the
forest
it
grew
almost
as
dark
as
pitch
you
followed
just
as
you
could
and
could
only
guide
yourself
by
your
ear
when
the
hounds
gave
cry
or
the
horns
sounded
on
you
blundered
hit
or
miss
headlong
down
the
rocks
and
through
the
branches
horses
warmed
wonderfully
to
the
business
scrambled
like
cats
slid
down
like
otters
kept
their
footing
where
nobody
have
thought
anything
but
a
goat
could
stand
our
hunting
bloods
would
live
an
hour
in
a
french
forest
you
see
we
just
look
for
pace
and
strength
in
the
shoulders
we
do
much
want
anything
else
except
good
jumping
power
what
a
lot
of
fellows
even
in
the
crack
packs
will
always
funk
water
horses
will
fly
but
they
swim
now
to
my
fancy
a
clever
beast
ought
to
take
even
a
swelling
bit
of
water
like
a
duck
how
poor
standard
breasted
rivers
till
that
fool
staked
him
he
dropped
more
walnuts
into
his
wine
wistfully
recalling
a
mighty
hero
of
leicestershire
fame
that
had
given
him
many
a
magnificent
day
out
and
had
been
the
idol
of
his
stables
till
in
his
twelfth
year
the
noble
old
sorrel
had
been
killed
by
a
groom
recklessness
recklessness
that
met
with
such
chastisement
as
told
how
and
why
the
sobriquet
had
been
given
to
the
hand
that
would
lie
so
long
in
indolent
rest
to
strike
with
such
fearful
force
when
once
raised
well
he
went
on
once
more
we
were
all
of
us
scattered
scarcely
two
kept
together
anywhere
where
the
pack
was
where
the
boar
was
where
the
huntsmen
were
nobody
knew
now
and
then
i
heard
the
hounds
giving
tongue
at
the
distance
and
i
rode
after
that
to
the
best
of
my
science
and
uncommonly
bad
was
the
best
that
forest
work
perplexes
one
after
the
you
ca
view
the
beauties
two
minutes
together
and
as
for
sinning
by
overriding
you
very
safe
not
to
do
that
at
last
i
heard
a
crashing
sound
loud
and
furious
i
thought
they
had
got
him
to
bay
at
last
there
was
a
great
oak
thicket
as
hard
as
iron
and
as
close
as
a
net
between
me
and
the
place
the
boughs
were
all
twisted
together
god
knows
how
and
grew
so
low
down
that
the
naked
branches
had
to
be
broken
though
at
every
step
by
the
horse
fore
hoofs
before
he
could
force
a
step
we
did
force
it
somehow
at
last
and
came
into
a
green
open
space
where
there
were
fewer
trees
and
the
moon
was
shining
in
there
without
a
hound
near
true
enough
was
the
boar
rolling
on
the
ground
and
somebody
rolling
under
him
they
were
locked
in
so
close
they
looked
just
like
one
huge
beast
pitching
here
and
there
as
you
seen
the
rhinos
wallow
in
indian
jheels
of
course
i
leveled
my
rifle
but
i
waited
to
get
a
clear
aim
for
which
was
man
and
which
was
boar
the
deuce
a
bit
could
i
tell
just
as
i
had
pointed
beauty
voice
called
out
to
me
your
fire
ker
i
want
to
have
him
myself
it
was
he
that
was
under
the
brute
just
as
he
spoke
they
rolled
toward
me
the
boar
foaming
and
spouting
blood
and
plunging
his
tusks
into
cecil
he
got
his
right
arm
out
from
under
the
beast
and
crushed
under
there
as
he
was
drew
it
free
with
the
knife
well
gripped
then
down
he
dashed
it
three
times
into
the
veteran
hide
just
beneath
the
ribs
it
was
the
coup
de
grace
the
boar
lay
dead
and
beauty
lay
half
dead
too
the
blood
rushing
out
of
him
where
the
tusks
had
dived
two
minutes
though
and
a
draught
of
my
brandy
brought
him
all
round
and
the
first
words
he
spoke
were
ker
you
did
as
you
would
be
done
by
a
shot
would
have
spoilt
it
all
the
brute
had
crossed
his
path
far
away
from
the
pack
and
he
had
flung
himself
out
of
saddle
and
had
a
struggle
and
that
night
we
played
baccarat
by
his
bedside
to
amuse
him
and
he
played
just
as
well
as
ever
now
this
is
why
i
do
think
he
dead
a
fellow
who
served
a
wild
boar
like
that
wo
have
let
a
train
knock
him
over
and
i
believe
he
forged
that
stiff
though
all
the
evidence
says
so
beauty
had
a
touch
of
the
blackguard
in
with
which
declaration
of
his
views
kergenven
lapsed
into
immutable
silence
and
slumberous
apathy
from
whose
shelter
nothing
could
tempt
him
afresh
and
the
colonel
with
all
the
rest
lounged
into
the
anteroom
where
the
tables
were
set
and
began
plunging
in
earnest
at
sums
that
might
sound
fabulous
were
they
written
here
the
players
staked
heavily
but
it
was
the
gallery
who
watched
around
making
their
bets
and
backing
their
favorites
that
lost
on
the
whole
the
most
horse
guards
have
heard
of
the
plunging
think
we
going
too
fast
murmured
the
chief
to
kergenven
his
major
who
lifted
his
brows
and
murmured
back
with
the
demureness
of
a
maiden
tell
it
our
only
vice
we
models
of
which
possibly
would
not
have
been
received
with
the
belief
desirable
by
the
skeptics
of
pall
mall
so
the
de
profundis
was
said
over
bertie
cecil
and
beauty
of
the
brigades
ceased
to
be
named
in
the
service
and
soon
ceased
to
be
even
remembered
in
the
of
life
there
is
no
time
to
look
back
at
the
failures
who
have
gone
down
over
a
double
and
drop
and
fallen

to

circle
of
applauders
was
launched
with
all
the
piquance
of
inimitable
and
from
a
speaker
who
had
perched
astride
on
a
broken
fragment
of
wall
with
her
barrel
of
wine
set
up
on
end
on
the
stones
in
front
of
her
and
her
six
soldiers
her
gros
bebees
as
she
was
given
maternally
to
calling
them
lounging
at
their
ease
on
the
arid
dusty
turf
below
she
was
very
pretty
audaciously
pretty
though
her
skin
was
burned
to
a
bright
sunny
brown
and
her
hair
was
cut
as
short
as
a
boy
and
her
face
had
not
one
regular
feature
in
it
but
then
regularity
who
wanted
it
who
would
have
thought
the
most
pure
classic
type
a
change
for
the
better
with
those
dark
dancing
challenging
eyes
with
that
arch
brilliant
face
so
sunny
so
mignon
and
those
scarlet
lips
like
a
bud
of
camellia
that
were
never
so
handsome
as
when
a
cigarette
was
between
them
or
sooth
to
say
not
seldom
a
short
pipe
itself
she
was
pretty
she
was
insolent
she
was
intolerably
coquettish
she
was
mischievous
as
a
marmoset
she
would
swear
if
need
be
like
a
zouave
she
could
fire
galloping
she
could
toss
off
her
brandy
or
her
vermouth
like
a
trooper
she
would
on
occasion
clinch
her
little
brown
hand
and
deal
a
blow
that
the
recipient
would
not
covet
twice
she
was
an
enfant
de

and
had
all
its
wickedness
at
her
fingers
she
would
sing
you
guinguette
songs
till
you
were
suffocated
with
laughter
and
she
would
dance
the
cancan
at
the
salle
de
mars
with
the
biggest
giant
of
a
cuirassier
there
and
yet
with
all
that
she
was
not
wholly
unsexed
with
all
that
she
had
the
delicious
fragrance
of
youth
and
had
not
left
a
certain
feminine
grace
behind
her
though
she
wore
a
vivandiere
uniform
and
had
been
born
in
a
barrack
and
meant
to
die
in
a
battle
it
was
the
blending
of
the
two
that
made
her
piquante
made
her
a
notoriety
in
her
own
way
known
at
pleasure
and
equally
in

laughed
considering

diable
i
did
a
neat
thing
yesterday
out
on
the
hills
there
was
a
shepherd
he
got
two
live
geese
swinging
by
their
feet
they
were
screeching
screeching
screeching
and
they
looked
so
nice
and
so
plump
that
i
could
smell
them
as
if
they
were
stewing
in
a
casserole
till
i
began
to
get
as
hungry
as
a
gamin
a
lunge
would
just
have
cut
the
question
at
once
but
the
orders
have
got
so
strict
about
petting
the
natives
i
thought
i
would
have
any
violence
if
the
thing
would
go
nice
and
smoothly
so
i
just
walked
behind
him
and
tripped
him
up
before
he
knew
where
he
was
it
was
a
picture
he
was
down
with
his
face
in
the
sand
before
you
could
sing
then
i
just
sat
upon
him
but
gently
very
gently
and
what
with
the
sand
and
the
heat
and
the
surprise
and
in
truth
perhaps
a
little
too
my
own
weight
he
was
half
suffocated
he
had
never
seen
me
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
was
sitting
on
him
and
i
sent
my
voice
out
with
a
roar
am
a
demon
and
the
fiend
hath
bidden
me
take
him
thy
soul
ah
how
he
began
to
tremble
and
to
kick
and
to
quiver
he
thought
it
was
the
devil
of
him
and
he
began
to
moan
as
well
as
the
sand
would
let
him
that
he
was
a
poor
man
and
an
innocent
and
the
geese
were
the
only
things
he
ever
stole
in
all
his
life
then
i
went
through
a
little
pantomime
with
him
and
i
was
very
terrible
in
my
threats
and
he
was
choking
and
choking
with
the
sand
though
he
never
let
go
of
the
geese
at
last
i
relented
a
little
and
told
him
i
would
spare
him
that
once
if
he
gave
up
the
stolen
goods
and
never
lifted
his
head
for
an
hour
sapristi
how
glad
he
was
of
the
terms
i
dare
say
my
weight
was
unpleasant
so
the
geese
made
us
a
divine
stew
that
night
and
the
last
thing
i
saw
of
my
man
was
his
lying
flat
as
i
left
him
with
his
face
still
down
in
the
cigarette
nodded
and
laughed
pretty
fair
tata
but
i
have
heard
better
bah
a
grand
thing
certainly
to
fright
a
peasant
and
scamper
off
with
a
goose
sacre
bleu
grumbled
tata
who
was
himself
of
opinion
that
his
exploit
had
been
worthy
of
the
feats
of
harlequin
thy
heart
is
all
gone
to
the
cigarette
laughed
saucily
and
heartily
tickled
at
the
joke
sentiment
has
an
exquisitely
ludicrous
side
when
one
is
a
perched
astride
on
a
wall
and
dispensing
wine
to
half
a
dozen
spahis
my
heart
is
a
reveil
matin
tata
it
wakes
fresh
every
day
an
englishman
why
dost
thou
think
him
that
because
he
is
a
giant
said
tata
cigarette
snapped
her
fingers
i
have
danced
with
grenadiers
and
cuirassiers
quite
as
tall
and
twice
as
heavy
apres
because
he
bathes
splash
like
any
because
he
is
because
he
rises
in
his
because
he
likes
the
because
he
knows
because
he
is
so
quiet
and
blazes
like
the
devil
under
which
mass
of
overwhelming
proofs
of
nationality
the
amie
du
drapeau
gave
in
yes
like
enough
besides
the
other
one
is
english
one
of
the
chasseurs
tells
me
that
the
other
one
waits
on
him
like
a
slave
when
he
can
cleans
his
harness
litters
his
horse
saves
him
all
the
hard
work
when
he
can
do
it
without
being
found
out
where
did
they
come
from
they
will
never
cigarette
tossed
her
nonchalant
head
with
a
pout
of
her
cherry
lips
and
a
slang
oath
paf
they
will
tell
it
to
me
thou
mayest
make
a
lion
tame
a
vulture
leave
blood
a
drum
beat
its
own
rataplan
a
dead
man
fire
a
musket
but
thou
wilt
never
make
an
englishman
speak
when
he
is
bent
to
be
cigarette
launched
a
choice
missile
of
barrack
slang
and
an
array
of
metaphors
which
their
propounder
thought
stupendous
in
their
brilliancy
when
you
stole
your
geese
you
did
but
take
your
brethren
home
englishmen
are
but
men
put
the
wine
in
their
head
make
them
whirl
in
a
waltz
promise
them
a
kiss
and
one
turns
such
brains
as
they
have
inside
out
as
a
turns
a
dead
soldier
wallet
when
a
woman
is
handsome
she
is
never
denied
he
shall
tell
me
where
he
comes
from
i
doubt
that
it
is
from
england
see
here
why
not
first
he
never
says
second
he
do
eat
his
meat
raw
third
he
speaks
very
soft
fourth
he
waltzes
so
light
so
light
fifth
he
never
grumbles
in
his
throat
like
an
angry
bear
sixth
there
is
no
fog
in
him
how
can
he
be
english
with
all
that
there
are
english
and
english
said
the
philosophic
tata
who
piqued
himself
on
being
serenely
cosmopolitan
cigarette
blew
a
contemptuous
puff
of
smoke
there
was
never
one
yet
that
did
not
growl
pauvres
diables
if
they
do
use
their
tusks
they
sit
and
sulk
an
englishman
is
always
boxing
or
grumbling
the
two
make
up
his
which
view
of
she
had
derived
from
a
profound
study
of
various
vaudevilles
in
which
the
traditional
was
in
his
usual
hues
and
having
delivered
it
she
sprang
down
from
her
wall
strapped
on
her
little
barrel
nodded
to
her
gros
bebees
where
they
lounged
in
the
shadow
of
the
stone
wall
and
left
them
to
resume
their
game
at
boc
while
she
started
on
her
way
as
swift
and
as
light
as
a
chamois
singing
with
gay
ringing
emphasis
that
echoed
all
down
the
hot
and
silent
air
hers
was
a
dashing
dauntless
vivacious
life
just
in
its
youth
loving
plunder
and
mischief
and
mirth
caring
for
nothing
and
always
ready
with
a
laugh
a
song
a
slang
repartee
or
a
shot
from
the
dainty
pistols
thrust
in
her
sash
that
a
general
of
division
had
given
her
whichever
best
suited
the
moment
she
had
never
shed
tears
in
her
life
her
mother
a
her
father
nobody
knew
who
a
spoiled
child
of
the
army
from
her
birth
with
a
heart
as
bronzed
as
her
cheek
yet
with
odd
stray
instincts
here
and
there
of
a
nobility
and
of
a
wild
grace
that
nothing
could
kill
cigarette
was
the
pet
of
the
army
of
africa
and
was
as
lawless
as
most
of
her
patrons
she
would
eat
a
succulent
duck
thinking
it
all
the
spicier
because
it
had
been
a
soldier
loot
she
would
wear
the
gold
plunder
off
dead
arabs
dress
and
never
have
a
pang
of
conscience
with
it
she
would
dance
all
night
long
when
she
had
a
chance
like
a
little
bacchante
she
would
shoot
a
man
if
need
be
with
all
the
nonchalance
in
the
world
she
had
had
a
thousand
lovers
from
handsome
marquises
of
the
guides
to
tawny
scoundrels
in
the
zouaves
and
she
had
never
loved
anything
except
the
roll
of
the
pas
de
charge
and
the
sight
of
her
own
arch
defiant
face
with
its
scarlet
lips
and
its
short
jetty
hair
when
she
saw
it
by
chance
in
some
burnished
cuirass
that
served
her
for
a
mirror
she
was
more
like
a
handsome
saucy
boy
than
anything
else
under
the
sun
and
yet
there
was
that
in
the
pretty
impudent
little
friend
of
the
flag
that
was
feminine
with
it
all
generous
and
graceful
amid
all
her
boldness
and
her
license
her
revelries
and
the
unsettled
life
she
led
in
the
barracks
and
the
camps
under
the
shadow
of
the
eagles
away
she
went
down
the
crooked
windings
and
over
the
ruined
gardens
of
the
old
moorish
quarter
of
the
cashbah
the
hilts
of
the
tiny
pistols
glancing
in
the
sun
and
the
fierce
fire
of
the
burning
sunlight
pouring
down
unheeded
on
the
brave
bright
hawk
eyes
that
had
never
since
they
first
opened
to
the
world
drooped
or
dimmed
for
the
rays
of
the
sun
or
the
gaze
of
a
lover
for
the
menace
of
death
or
the
presence
of
war
of
course
she
was
a
little
amazon
of
course
she
was
a
little
guerrilla
of
course
she
did
not
know
what
a
blush
meant
of
course
her
thoughts
were
as
slang
and
as
riotous
as
her
mutinous
mischief
was
in
its
act
but
she
was
bon
soldat
as
she
was
given
to
say
with
a
toss
of
her
curly
head
and
she
had
some
of
the
virtues
of
soldiers
soldiers
had
been
about
her
ever
since
she
first
remembered
having
a
wooden
casserole
for
a
cradle
and
sucking
down
red
wine
through
a
soldiers
had
been
her
books
her
teachers
her
models
her
guardians
and
later
on
her
lovers
all
the
days
of
her
life
she
had
had
no
except
the
eagles
on
the
standards
she
had
had
no
except
the
rataplan
and
the
reveille
she
had
had
no
sense
of
duty
taught
her
except
to
face
fire
boldly
never
to
betray
a
comrade
and
to
worship
but
two
deities
la
gloire
and
la
yet
there
were
tales
told
in
the
and
under
canvas
of
the
little
amie
du
drapeau
that
had
a
gentler
side
of
how
softly
she
would
touch
the
wounded
of
how
deftly
she
would
cure
them
of
how
carelessly
she
would
dash
through
under
a
raking
fire
to
take
a
draught
of
water
to
a
dying
man
of
how
she
had
sat
by
an
old
grenadier
to
sing
to
him
refusing
to
stir
though
it
was
a
fete
at
chalons
and
she
loved
fetes
as
only
a
french
girl
can
of
how
she
had
ridden
twenty
leagues
on
a
saddleless
arab
horse
to
fetch
the
surgeon
of
the
spahis
to
a
bedouin
perishing
in
the
desert
of
of
how
she
had
sent
every
sou
of
her
money
to
her
mother
so
long
as
that
mother
lived
a
brutal
drunk
old
woman
who
had
beaten
her
oftentimes
as
the
sole
maternal
attention
when
she
was
but
an
infant
these
things
were
told
of
cigarette
and
with
a
perfect
truth
she
was
a
thorough
scamp
but
a
thorough
soldier
as
she
classified
herself
her
own
sex
would
have
seen
no
good
in
her
but
her
could
and
did
of
a
surety
she
missed
virtues
that
women
prize
but
not
less
of
a
surety
had
she
caught
some
that
they
miss
singing
her
refrain
on
she
dashed
now
swift
as
a
greyhound
light
as
a
hare
glancing
here
and
glancing
there
as
she
bounded
over
the
picturesque
desolation
of
the
cashbah
it
was
just
noon
and
there
were
few
could
brave
the
as
she
did
it
was
very
still
there
was
only
from
a
little
distance
the
roll
of
the
french
where
the
drummers
of
the
african
regiments
were
practicing
hola
cried
cigarette
to
herself
as
her
darted
right
and
left
and
like
a
chamois
she
leaped
down
over
the
great
masses
of
turkish
ruins
cleared
the
channel
of
a
dry
and
alighted
just
in
front
of
a
chasseur
who
was
sitting
alone
on
a
broken
fragment
of
white
marble
relic
of
some
moorish
mosque
whose
delicate
columns
crowned
with
grasses
rose
behind
him
against
the
deep
intense
blue
of
the
cloudless
sky
he
was
sitting
thoughtfully
enough
almost
wearily
tracing
figures
in
the
dry
sand
of
the
soil
with
the
point
of
his
scabbard
yet
he
had
all
the
look
about
him
of
a
brilliant
french
soldier
of
one
who
moreover
had
seen
hot
and
stern
service
he
was
bronzed
but
scarcely
looked
so
after
the
red
brown
and
black
of
the
zouaves
and
the
turcos
for
his
skin
was
naturally
very
fair
the
features
delicate
the
eyes
very
soft
for
which
tata
had
growled
contemptuously
a
woman
face
a
long
silken
chestnut
beard
swept
over
his
chest
and
his
figure
as
he
leaned
there
in
the
blue
and
scarlet
and
gold
of
the
chasseurs
uniform
with
his
spurred
heel
thrust
into
the
sand
and
his
arm
resting
on
his
knee
was
as
cigarette
critical
eye
told
her
the
figure
of
a
superb
cavalry
rider
light
supple
long
of
limb
wide
of
chest
with
every
sinew
and
nerve
as
links
of
steel
she
glanced
at
his
hands
which
were
very
white
despite
the
sun
of
algiers
and
the
labors
that
fall
to
a
private
of
chasseurs
beau
lion
she
thought
and
noble
whatever
he
but
the
best
of
blood
was
not
new
to
her
in
the
ranks
of
the
algerian
regiments
she
had
known
so
many
of
them
those
gilded
butterflies
of
the
chaussee
those
lordly
spendthrifts
of
the
vieille
roche
who
had
served
in
the
battalions
of
the
or
the
squadrons
of
the
french
horse
to
be
thrust
nameless
and
unhonored
into
a
hastily
dug
with
bayonets
in
the
hot
hush
of
an
african
night
she
woke
him
unceremoniously
from
his
reverie
with
a
challenge
to
wine
ah
ha
tata
leroux
says
you
are
english
by
the
faith
he
must
be
right
or
you
would
never
sit
musing
there
like
an
owl
in
the
sunlight
take
a
draught
of
my
burgundy
bright
as
rubies
i
never
sell
bad
wines
not
i
i
know
better
than
to
drink
them
he
started
and
rose
and
before
he
took
the
little
wooden
bowed
to
her
raising
his
cap
with
a
grave
courteous
obeisance
a
bow
that
had
used
to
be
noted
in
for
its
perfection
of
grace
ah
ma
belle
is
it
you
he
said
wearily
you
do
me
much
cigarette
gave
a
little
petulant
twist
to
the
tap
of
her
she
was
not
used
to
that
style
of
salutation
she
half
liked
it
half
resented
it
it
made
her
wish
with
an
impatient
scorn
for
the
wish
that
she
knew
how
to
read
and
had
not
her
hair
cut
short
like
a
boy
a
weakness
the
little
vivandiere
had
never
been
visited
with
before
morbleu
she
said
pettishly
you
are
too
fine
for
us
mon
brave
in
what
country
i
should
wonder
does
one
learn
such
dainty
ceremony
as
that
where
should
one
learn
courtesies
if
not
in
france
he
answered
wearily
he
had
danced
with
this
the
night
before
at
a
guinguette
ball
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
for
it
was
almost
the
first
time
he
had
been
in
the
city
since
the
night
when
he
had
thrown
the
dice
and
lost
ten
napoleons
and
the
bedouins
to
claude
de
chanrellon
but
his
thoughts
were
far
from
her
in
this
moment
ouf
you
have
learnt
carte
and
tierce
with
your
tongue
cried
cigarette
provoked
to
receive
no
more
compliment
than
that
from
generals
and
staff
officers
as
from
drummers
and
trumpeters
she
was
accustomed
to
flattery
and
wooing
luscious
as
sugared
chocolate
and
ardent
as
flirtation
with
a
barrack
flavor
about
it
commonly
is
she
would
as
often
as
not
to
be
sure
finish
it
with
the
of
her
pistol
or
the
of
some
bit
of
stinging
sarcasm
but
still
for
all
that
she
liked
it
and
resented
its
omission
they
say
you
are
english
but
i
do
believe
it
you
speak
too
soft
and
you
sound
the
double
l
too
well
a
spaniard
do
you
find
me
so
devout
a
catholic
that
you
think
so
she
laughed
a
greek
then
still
worse
have
you
seen
me
cheat
at
cards
an
austrian
you
waltz
like
a
white
coat
he
shook
his
head
she
stamped
her
little
foot
into
the
ground
a
foot
fit
for
a
model
with
its
shapely
military
boot
spurred
too
for
cigarette
rode
like
a
say
what
you
are
then
at
a
soldier
of
france
can
you
wish
me
more
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
flashed
and
softened
her
one
love
was
the
tricolor
true
she
said
simply
but
you
were
not
always
a
soldier
of
france
you
joined
they
say
twelve
years
ago
what
were
you
before
then
she
here
cast
herself
down
in
front
of
him
and
with
her
elbows
on
the
sand
and
her
chin
on
her
hands
watched
him
with
all
the
frank
curiosity
and
unmoved
nonchalance
imaginable
as
she
launched
the
question
before
he
said
slowly
well
a
you
belonged
in
the
majority
then
said
cigarette
with
a
piquance
made
a
thousand
times
more
piquant
by
the
camp
slang
she
spoke
in
you
should
not
have
had
to
come
into
the
ranks
mon
ami
majorities
specially
that
majority
have
very
smooth
sailing
generally
he
looked
at
her
more
closely
though
she
wearied
him
where
have
you
got
your
ironies
cigarette
you
are
so
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
bah
one
is
never
young
and
always
young
in
camps
young
pardieu
when
i
was
four
i
could
swear
like
a
grenadier
plunder
like
a
prefet
lie
like
a
priest
and
drink
like
a
yet
with
all
that
and
it
was
the
truth
the
brow
was
so
open
under
the
close
rings
of
the
curls
the
skin
so
clear
under
the
the
mouth
so
rich
and
so
arch
in
its
youth
why
did
you
come
into
the
service
she
went
on
before
he
had
a
chance
to
answer
her
you
were
born
in
the
noblesse
bah
i
know
an
aristocrat
at
a
glance
now
many
of
those
aristocrats
come
shoals
of
them
but
it
is
always
for
something
they
all
come
for
something
most
of
them
have
been
ruined
by
the
lionnes
a
hundred
million
of
francs
gone
in
a
quarter
ah
bah
what
blind
bats
the
best
of
you
are
they
have
gambled
or
bet
or
got
into
hot
water
or
fought
too

or
something
all
the
aristocrats
that
come
to
africa
are
ruined
what
ruined
you
aristocrat
i

a
duke
a

what
ruined
you
what
ruins
most
men
i
imagine
folly
sure
enough
retorted
cigarette
with
scornful
acquiescence
she
had
no
patience
with
him
he
danced
so
deliciously
he
looked
so
superb
and
he
would
give
her
nothing
but
these
absent
answers
wisdom
do
bring
men
who
look
as
you
look
into
the
ranks
of
the
volunteers
for
africa
besides
you
are
too
handsome
to
be
a
sage
he
laughed
a
little
i
never
was
one
that
certain
and
you
are
too
pretty
to
be
a
a
what
she
did
not
know
the
word
is
that
a
good
cigar
you
have
give
me
one
do
women
smoke
in
your
old
country
oh
yes
many
of
where
is
it
then
i
have
no
country
but
the
one
you
had
i
have
forgotten
i
ever
had
did
it
treat
you
ill
then
not
at
had
you
anything
you
cared
for
in
it
well
what
was
it
a
woman
no
a
he
stooped
his
head
a
little
as
he
said
it
and
traced
more
figures
slowly
in
the
sand
ah
she
drew
a
short
quick
breath
she
understood
that
she
would
only
have
laughed
at
him
had
it
been
a
woman
cigarette
was
more
veracious
than
complimentary
in
her
estimate
of
her
own
sex
there
was
a
man
in
the
cuirassiers
i
knew
she
went
on
softly
loved
a
horse
like
that
he
would
have
died
for
cossack
but
he
was
a
terrible
gambler
terrible
not
but
what
i
like
to
play
myself
well
one
day
he
played
and
played
till
he
was
mad
and
everything
was
gone
and
then
in
his
rage
he
staked
the
only
thing
he
had
left
staked
and
lost
the
horse
he
never
said
a
word
but
he
just
slipped
a
pistol
in
his
pocket
went
to
the
stable
kissed
cossack
once
twice
thrice
and
shot
himself
through
the
poor
fellow
murmured
the
chasseur
in
his
chestnut
beard
cigarette
was
watching
him
with
all
the
keenness
of
her
falcon
eyes
he
had
gambled
away
a
good
deal
too
she
thought
it
is
always
the
same
old
story
with
your
cigars
are
good
mon
lion
she
said
impatiently
as
she
sprang
up
her
lithe
elastic
figure
in
the
bright
vivandiere
uniform
standing
out
in
full
relief
against
the
pearly
gray
of
the
ruined
pillars
the
vivid
green
of
the
rank
vegetation
and
the
intense
light
of
the
noon
your
cigars
are
good
but
it
is
more
than
your
company
is
if
you
had
been
as
dull
as
this
last
night
i
would
not
have
danced
a
single
turn
with
you
in
the
cancan
and
with
a
bound
to
which
indignation
lent
wings
like
a
swallow
the
friend
of
the
flag
insulted
and
amazed
at
the
apathy
with
which
her
advances
to
friendship
had
been
received
dashed
off
at
her
topmost
speed
singing
all
the
louder
out
of
bravado
to
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
me
after
dancing
with
me
all
night
thought
cigarette
with
fierce
wrath
at
such
contumely
the
first
neglect
the
pet
of
the
spahis
had
ever
experienced
she
was
incensed
too
that
she
had
been
degraded
into
that
momentary
wish
that
she
knew
how
to
read
and
looked
less
like
a
boy
just
because
a
chasseur
with
white
hands
and
silent
ways
had
made
her
a
grave
bow
she
was
more
incensed
still
because
she
could
not
get
at
his
history
and
felt
despite
herself
a
reluctance
to
bribe
him
for
it
with
those
cajoleries
whose
potency
she
had
boasted
to
tata
leroux
let
him
take
care
muttered
the
passionately
in
her
little
white
teeth
so
small
and
so
pearly
though
they
had
gripped
a
bridle
tight
before
then
when
each
hand
was
filled
with
a
pistol
let
him
take
care
if
he
offend
me
there
are
five
hundred
swords
that
will
thrust
civility
into
him
five
hundred
shots
that
will
teach
him
the
cost
of
daring
to
provoke
cigarette
en
route
through
the
town
her
wayward
way
took
the
pretty
brunette
friend
of
the
flag
as
many
devious
meandering
as
a
bird
takes
in
a
summer
day
flight
when
it
stops
here
for
a
berry
there
for
a
grass
seed
here
to
dip
its
beak
into
cherries
there
to
dart
after
a

to
shake
its
wings
in
a
brook
there
to
poise
on
a
she
loitered
in
a
thousand
places
for
cigarette
knew
everybody
she
chatted
with
a
group
of
turcos
she
emptied
her
barrel
for
some
zouaves
she
ate
sweetmeats
with
a
lot
of
negro
boys
she
boxed
a
little
drummer
ear
for
slurring
over
the
tintin
at
his
practice
she
drank
a
with
some
officers
at
a
cafe
she
had
ten
where
she
beat
hollow
a
young
dandy
of
the
guides
who
had
come
to
look
at
algiers
for
a
week
and
made
even
points
with
one
of
the
first
shots
of
the
cavalry
a
pied
as
the
algerian
antithesis
runs
finally
she
paused
before
the
open
french
window
of
a
villa
in
tamarisk
and
orange
and
pomegranate
with
the
flowers
glaring
in
the
sun
and
a
hedge
of
wild
cactus
fencing
it
in
through
the
cactus
she
made
her
way
as
easily
as
a
rabbit
burrows
it
would
have
been
an
impossibility
to
cigarette
to
enter
by
any
ordinary
means
and
balancing
herself
lightly
on
the
sill
for
a
second
stood
looking
in
at
the
chamber
ho
le
marquis
the
zouaves
have
drunk
all
my
wine
up
fill
me
my
keg
with
yours
for
once
the
very
best
burgundy
mind
i
half
afraid
your
cellar
will
hurt
my
the
chamber
was
very
handsome
hung
and
furnished
in
the
very
best
paris
fashion
and
all
glittering
with
amber
and
ormolu
and
velvets
in
it
half
a
dozen
men
officers
of
the
cavalry
were
sitting
over
their
noon
breakfast
and
playing
at
lansquenet
at
the
same
time
the
table
was
crowded
with
dishes
of
every
sort
and
wines
of
every
vintage
and
the
fragrance
of
their
bouquet
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
the
heavy
scent
of
the
orange
blossom
without
mingled
together
in
an
intense
perfume
he
whom
she
addressed
le
marquis
de
chateauroy
laughed
and
looked
up
ah
is
it
thee
my
pretty
brunette
take
what
thou
wantest
out
of
the
ice
the
best
growths
asked
cigarette
with
the
dubious
air
and
caution
of
a
connoisseur
yes
said
le
marquis
amused
with
the
precautions
taken
with
his
cellar
one
of
the
finest
in
algiers
come
in
and
have
some
breakfast
ma
belle
only
pay
the
where
he
sat
between
the
window
and
the
table
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
drew
her
pretty
face
down
cigarette
with
the
laugh
of
a
saucy
child
whisked
her
cigar
out
of
her
mouth
and
blew
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
in
his
eyes
she
had
no
particular
fancy
for
him
though
she
had
for
his
wines
shouts
of
mirth
from
the
other
men
completed
the
discomfiture
as
she
swayed
away
from
him
and
went
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
emptying
some
bottles
unceremoniously
into
her
iced
ruby
perfumy
claret
that
she
could
not
have
bought
anywhere
for
the
barracks
hola
cried
the
marquis
thou
art
not
generally
so
coy
with
thy
kisses
cigarette
tossed
her
head
i
do
like
bad
clarets
after
good
i
just
been
with
your
corporal
you
are
no
beauty
after
him
le
chateauroy
face
darkened
he
was
a
man
whose
bone
was
iron
and
whose
muscles
were
like
he
had
a
dark
keen
head
like
an
eagle
the
brow
narrow
but
very
high
looking
higher
because
the
hair
was
worn
off
the
temples
thin
lips
hidden
by
heavy
curling
mustaches
and
a
skin
burned
black
by
long
african
service
still
he
was
fairly
handsome
enough
not
to
have
muttered
so
heavy
an
oath
as
he
did
at
the
vivandiere
jest
sacre
bleu
i
wish
my
corporal
were
shot
one
can
never
hear
the
last
of
cigarette
darted
a
quick
glance
at
him
oh
ho
jealous
mon
brave
thought
her
quick
wits
and
why
i
wonder
you
have
a
finer
soldier
in
your
chasseurs
mon
cher
do
wish
him
shot
for
the
good
of
the
service
said
the
viscount
de
chanrellon
who
had
now
a
command
of
his
own
in
the
light
cavalry
of
algiers
pardieu
if
i
had
to
choose
whether
i
be
backed
by
or
by
six
other
men
in
a
skirmish
i
choose
him
and
risk
the
chateauroy
tossed
off
his
burgundy
with
a
contemptuous
impatience
diable
that
is
the
exaggerated
nonsense
one
always
hears
about
this
fellow
as
if
he
were
a
second
roland
or
a
revivified
bayard
i
see
nothing
particular
in
him
except
that
he
too
fine
a
gentleman
for
the
fine
ah
laughed
cigarette
he
made
me
bow
this
morning
like
a
chamberlain
and
his
beard
is
like
carded
silk
and
he
has
such
hands
mon
dieu
but
he
is
a
rather
laughed
claude
de
chanrellon
as
magnificent
a
soldier
himself
as
ever
crossed
swords
i
said
he
would
eat
fire
the
very
minute
he
played
that
queer
game
of
dice
with
me
years
ago
i
wish
i
had
him
instead
of
you
chateauroy
like
lightning
in
a
charge
and
yet
the
very
man
for
a
dangerous
bit
of
secret
service
that
wants
the
softness
of
a
panther
we
all
let
our
tongues
go
too
much
but
he
says
so
little
just
a
word
here
a
word
there
when
one
wanted
no
more
and
he
the
devil
own
to
the
marquis
heard
the
praise
of
his
corporal
knitting
his
heavy
brows
it
was
evident
the
private
was
no
favorite
with
him
the
fellow
rides
well
enough
he
said
with
an
affectation
of
carelessness
there
for
what
i
see
is
the
end
of
his
marvels
i
wish
you
had
him
claude
with
all
my
oh
ha
cried
chanrellon
wiping
the
rhenish
off
his
tawny
mustaches
he
should
have
been
a
captain
by
this
if
i
had
morbleu
he
is
a
splendid
sabreur
kills
as
many
men
to
his
own
sword
as
i
could
myself
when
it
comes
to
a
fight
breaks
horses
in
like
magic
rides
them
like
the
wind
has
a
hawk
eye
over
open
country
obeys
like
clockwork
what
more
can
you
want
obeys
yes
said
the
colonel
of
chasseurs
with
a
snarl
he
obey
without
a
word
if
you
ordered
him
to
walk
up
to
a
cannon
mouth
and
be
blown
from
it
but
he
gives
you
such
a
d
d
languid
grand
seigneur
glance
as
he
listens
that
one
would
think
he
commanded
the
but
he
very
popular
with
your
men
too
monsieur
the
worst
quality
a
corporal
can
have
his
idea
of
maintaining
discipline
is
to
treat
them
to
cognac
and
give
them
pardieu
not
a
bad
way
either
with
our
french
he
knows
them
that
he
has
to
deal
with
that
brave
fellow
your
squadrons
would
go
to
the
devil
after
the
colonel
gave
a
grim
laugh
i
dare
say
nobody
knows
the
way
cigarette
flirting
with
the
other
officers
drinking
champagne
by
great
glassfuls
eating
bonbons
from
one
sipping
another
soup
pulling
the
limbs
of
a
succulent
ortolan
to
pieces
with
a
relish
and
devouring
truffles
with
all
the
zest
of
a
did
not
lose
a
word
and
catching
the
inflection
of
chateauroy
voice
settled
with
her
own
thoughts
that
was
not
a
fair
field
or
a
smooth
course
with
his
colonel
the
heart
of
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
veered
round
with
her
sex
common
custom
to
the
side
that
was
the
weakest
dieu
de
dieu
le
colonel
she
cried
while
she
ate
le
foie
gras
with
as
little
ceremony
and
as
much
enjoyment
as
would
be
expected
from
a
young
plunderer
accustomed
to
think
a
meal
all
the
better
spiced
by
being
stolen
by
the
rules
of
war
whatever
else
your
handsome
corporal
is
he
is
an
aristocrat
ah
ha
i
know
the
aristocrats
i
do
their
touch
is
so
gentle
and
their
speech
is
so
soft
and
they
have
no
slang
of
the
camp
and
yet
they
are
such
diablotins
to
fight
and
eat
steel
and
die
laughing
all
so
quiet
and
nonchalant
give
me
the
aristocrats
the
real
thing
you
know
not
the
just
gilt
that
are
ashamed
of
being
honest
bread
but
the
old
blood
like
the
colonel
laughed
but
restlessly
the
little
ingrate
had
aimed
at
a
sore
point
in
him
he
was
of
the
first
empire
nobility
and
he
was
weak
enough
though
a
fierce
dauntless
soldier
to
be
discontented
with
the
great
fact
that
his
father
had
been
a
hero
of
the
army
of
italy
and
scarce
inferior
in
genius
to
massena
because
impatient
of
the
minor
one
that
before
strapping
on
a
knapsack
to
have
his
first
taste
of
war
under
custine
the
marshal
had
been
but
a
postilion
at
a
posting
inn
in
the
heart
of
the
nivernais
ah
my
brunette
he
answered
with
a
rough
laugh
have
you
taken
my
popular
corporal
for
your
lover
you
should
give
your
old
friends
warning
first
or
he
may
chance
to
get
an
ugly
spit
on
a
the
amie
du
drapeau
tossed
off
her
sixth
glass
of
champagne
she
felt
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
a
flush
of
hot
blood
on
her
brown
clear
cheek
well
used
as
she
was
to
such
jests
and
such
lovers
as
these
ma
foi
she
said
coolly
he
would
be
more
likely
to
spit
than
be
spitted
if
it
came
to
a
duel
i
should
like
to
see
him
in
a
duel
there
is
not
a
prettier
sight
in
the
world
when
both
men
have
science
as
for
fighting
for
me
morbleau
i
will
thank
nobody
to
have
the
impudence
to
do
it
unless
i
order
them
out
coqueline
got
shot
for
me
you
remember
he
was
a
pretty
fellow
coqueline
and
they
killed
him
so
clumsily
that
they
disfigured
him
terribly
it
was
quite
a
pity
i
said
then
i
would
have
no
more
handsome
men
fight
about
me
you
may
if
you
like
le
black
which
title
she
gave
with
a
saucy
laugh
hitting
with
a
chocolate
bonbon
the
black
visage
of
the
omnipotent
chief
she
had
the
audacity
to
attack
high
or
low
they
were
all
the
same
to
cigarette
she
would
have
slanged
the
emperor
himself
with
the
coolness
and
the
army
had
given
her
a
passport
of
immunity
so
wide
that
it
would
have
fared
ill
with
anyone
who
had
ever
attempted
to
bring
the
vivandiere
to
book
for
her
uttermost
mischief
by
the
way
she
went
on
quick
as
thought
with
her
reckless
gayety
one
thing
your
corporal
will
demoralize
the
army
of
africa
monsieur
he
shall
have
an
ounce
of
cold
lead
before
he
does
what
in
he
will
demoralize
it
said
cigarette
with
a
sagacious
shake
of
her
head
if
they
follow
his
example
we
sha
have
a
chasseur
or
a
spahi
or
a
or
a
sapeur
worth
anything
sacre
what
does
he
do
the
colonel
strong
teeth
bit
savagely
through
his
cigar
he
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
able
to
find
a
single
thing
of
insubordination
or
laxity
of
duty
in
a
soldier
who
irritated
and
annoyed
him
but
who
obeyed
him
implicitly
and
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
his
regiment
he
wo
only
demoralize
the
army
pursued
the
cigarette
with
vivacious
eloquence
but
if
his
example
is
followed
he
ruin
the
prefets
close
the
bureaux
destroy
the
exchequer
beggar
all
the
officials
make
african
life
as
tame
as
milk
and
water
and
rob
you
le
colonel
of
your
very
highest
and
dearest
privilege
sacre
bleu
cried
her
hearers
as
their
hands
instinctively
sought
their
swords
what
does
he
do
cigarette
looked
at
them
out
of
her
arch
black
lashes
why
he
never
thieves
from
the
arabs
if
the
fashion
comes

cigarette
was

had
gaming
made
very

to
her

it
was
the
creed
of
the
army
that
her
losses
never
counted
but
her
gains
were
paid
to
her
often
double

well

she
play

so
well

her
that
she
might
have

one

was

away

for

in

as
its
song
to
a

its
swiftness
to
a

see

was
like
drinking
light
fiery

she
did
with

beholders
what
she
would
the

fling

the
gleam

never
more
irresistible
more

more
full
of

grace
it
was
a
poem

an
ode

her

was
in
it
that
heart
of

a
soldier
of

a
kitten

a
bohemian

an
epicurean
of
a

beat
so
brightly

so
boldly
under

of
her
little
brigand
soul
seemed
to
have
found
their
utterance
in
those
tiny
slender
spurred

restless
feet
that
never

the

to

himself
back
from
springing
in
to
seize
her
in

whirl
with
her
down
the

it

been

told
them
by

beckoned
one
out
a
blow
of
her
clinched
hand
and
a
cessation
of
her
impromptu

be
the
immediate

her
spectators
were
renowned

whose
names
rang
like

marabout

contempt
for

the

the

with

that
sparkled
like
the
live
coal

a
veteran
of

could
discipline
his

as
a
sheepdog
his
lambs
and
who
had
one
curt
martial
law
for
his
detachment
brief
as

trimmed
to
suit
either
an
attack
on

or
the
chastisement
of

lying
in
one

there
was
a
grisly
veteran
of

who
held
the
highest
repute
of
any
in
his
battalion
for
rushing
on
to
a
foe
with
a

that
could
equal
the

of
an

horse
for
having
stood
alone
once
the

of
thirty
bedouins
attack
and
ended
by
beating
them
back
though
a
dozen
spearheads
were
launched
into
his
body
and
his
pantalons
garances
were
filled
with
his
own
blood
and
for

a
matchless
system
of
night

that
swept
the

as

and
made
the
colons
surrender
every
hidden
treasure
from
a
pot
of
gold
to
a
hen
eggs
from
a
caldron
of
couscoussou
to
a
there
was
alcide
echauffourees
also
a
zephyr
who
had
his
nickname
from
the
marvelous
changes
of
costume
with
which
he
would
pursue
his
erratic
expedition
and
deceive
the
very
arabs
themselves
into
believing
him
a
born
mussulman
a
very
handsome
fellow
the
lauzun
of
his
battalion
the
brummel
of
his
caserne
coquette
with
his
kepi
on
one
side
of
his
graceful
head
and
his
mustaches
soft
as
a
lady
hair
whose
paradise
was
a
score
of
dangerous
intrigues
and
whose
seventh
heaven
was
a
duel
with
an
infuriated
husband
incorrigibly
lazy
but
with
the
italian
laziness
as
of
the
panther
who
sleeps
in
the
sun
and
with
such
episodes
of
romance
mischief
love
and
deviltry
in
his
years
of
existence
as
would
leave
behind
them
all
the
invention
of
dumas
pere
ou
fils
all
these
and
many
more
like
them
were
the
spectators
of
ballet
applauding
with
the
wild
hurrah
of
the
desert
with
the
clashing
of
spurs
with
the
thunder
of
feet
with
the
demoniac
shrieks
of
irrepressible
adoration
and
delight
and
every
now
and
then
her
bright
eyes
would
flash
over
the
ring
of
familiar
faces
and
glance
from
them
with
an
impatient
disappointment
as
she
danced
her
gros
bebees
were
not
enough
for
her
she
wanted
a
chasseur
with
white
hands
and
a
grave
smile
to
be
among
them
and
she
shook
back
her
curls
and
flushed
angrily
as
she
noted
his
absence
and
went
on
with
the
pirouettes
the
circling
flights
the
wild
resistless
abandonment
of
her
inspirations
till
she
was
like
a
little
that
is
intoxicated
with
the
scent
of
prey
borne
down
upon
the
wind
and
wheeling
like
a
mad
thing
in
the
transparent
ether
and
the
hot
de
pique
was
the
especial
estaminet
of
the
he
was
in
the
house
she
knew
it
had
she
not
seen
him
drinking
with
some
others
or
rather
paying
for
all
but
taking
little
himself
just
as
she
entered
he
was
in
the
house
this
mysterious
and
was
not
here
to
see
her
dance
not
here
to
see
the
darling
of
the
douars
the
pride
of
every
chacal
zephyr
and
chasseur
in
africa
the
amie
du
drapeau
who
was
adored
by
everyone
from
chefs
de
bataillons
to
fantassins
and
toasted
by
every
drinker
from
algiers
to
oran
in
the
champagne
of
messieurs
les
generaux
as
in
the
cric
of
the
loustics
round
a
he
was
not
there
he
was
leaning
over
the
little
wooden
ledge
of
a
narrow
window
in
an
inner
room
from
which
one
by
one
some
spahis
and
some
troopers
of
his
own
tribu
with
whom
he
had
just
been
drinking
such
burgundies
and
brandies
as
the
place
could
give
had
sloped
away
one
by
one
under
the
irresistible
attraction
of
the
vivandiere
an
attraction
however
that
had
not
seduced
them
till
all
the
bottles
were
emptied
bottles
more
in
number
and
higher
in
cost
than
was
prudent
in
a
corporal
who
had
but
his
pay
and
that
scant
enough
to
keep
himself
and
who
had
known
what
it
was
to
find
a
roll
of
white
bread
and
a
cup
of
coffee
a
luxury
beyond
all
reach
and
to
have
to
sell
his
whole
effects
up
to
the
last
thing
in
his
haversack
to
buy
a
toss
of
thin
wine
when
he
was
dying
of
thirst
or
a
slice
of
melon
when
he
was
parching
with
african
fever
but
prudence
had
at
no
time
been
his
specialty
and
the
reckless
life
of
algeria
was
not
one
to
teach
it
with
its
frank
brotherly
fellowship
that
bound
the
soldiers
of
each
battalion
or
each
squadron
so
closely
in
a
fraternity
of
which
every
member
took
as
freely
as
he
gave
its
gay
careless
carpe
diem
the
unconscious
philosophy
of
men
who
enjoyed
heart
and
soul
if
they
had
a
chance
because
they
knew
they
might
be
shot
dead
before
another
day
broke
and
its
swift
and
vivid
changes
that
made
tirailleurs
and
troopers
one
hour
rich
as
a
king
in
loot
in
wine
in
captives
at
the
sacking
of
a
tribe
to
be
the
next
day
famished
scorched
dragging
their
weary
limbs
or
urging
their
sinking
horses
through
endless
sand
and
burning
heat
glad
to
sell
a
cartouche
if
they
dared
so
break
regimental
orders
or
to
rifle
a
if
they
came
near
one
to
get
a
mouthful
of
food
changing
everything
in
their
haversack
for
a
sup
of
dirty
water
and
driven
to
pay
with
the
thrust
of
a
saber
for
a
lock
of
wretched
grass
to
keep
their
beasts
alive
through
the
sickliness
of
a
sirocco
all
these
taught
no
caution
to
any
nature
normally
without
it
and
the
chief
thing
that
his
regiment
had
loved
in
him
whom
they
named
from
the
first
day
that
he
had
bound
his
red
about
his
loins
and
the
officers
of
the
bureau
had
looked
over
the
new
volunteer
murmuring
admiringly
in
their
teeth
this
gallant
will
do
great
things
had
been
that
all
he
had
was
given
free
as
the
winds
to
any
who
asked
or
needed
the
all
was
slender
enough
unless
he
live
by
the
ingenuity
of
his
own
manufactures
or
by
thieving
or
intimidating
the
people
of
the
country
a
french
soldier
has
but
barren
fare
and
a
hard
struggle
with
hunger
and
poverty
and
it
was
the
one
murmur
against
him
when
he
was
lowest
in
the
ranks
that
he
would
never
follow
the
fashion
in
wringing
out
by
force
or
threat
the
possessions
of
the
native
population
the
one
reproach
that
made
his
fellow
soldiers
impatient
and
suspicious
of
him
was
that
he
refused
any
share
in
those
rough
arguments
of
blows
and
lunges
with
which
they
were
accustomed
to
persuade
every
victim
they
came
nigh
to
yield
them
up
all
such
treasures
of
food
or
drink
or
riches
from
sheep
liver
and
couscoussou
to
morocco
carpets
and
skins
of
brandy
and
coins
hid
in
the
sand
that
the
arabs
might
be
so
unhappy
as
to
own
in
their
reach
that
the
fattest
pullet
of
the
poorest
bedouin
was
as
sacred
to
him
as
the
banquet
of
his
own
chef
let
him
be
ever
so
famished
after
the
longest
day
march
was
an
eccentricity
and
an
insult
to
the
usages
of
the
corps
for
which
not
even
his
daring
and
his
popularity
could
wholly
procure
him
pardon
but
this
defect
in
him
was
counterbalanced
by
the
lavishness
with
which
his
pay
was
lent
given
or
spent
in
the
very
moment
of
its
receipt
if
a
man
of
his
tribu
wanted
anything
he
knew
that
would
offer
his
last
sous
to
aid
him
or
if
money
were
all
gone
would
sell
the
last
trifle
he
possessed
to
get
enough
to
assist
his
comrade
it
was
a
virtue
which
went
far
to
vouch
for
all
others
in
the
view
of
his
lawless
brethren
of
the
barracks
and
the
camp
and
made
them
forgive
him
many
moments
when
the
mood
of
silence
and
the
habit
of
solitude
not
uncommon
with
him
would
otherwise
have
incensed
a
fraternity
with
whom
to
live
apart
is
the
deadliest
charge
and
the
sentence
of
excommunication
against
any
who
dare
to
provoke
it
one
of
those
moods
was
on
him
now
he
had
had
a
drinking
bout
with
the
men
who
had
left
him
and
had
laughed
as
gayly
and
as
carelessly
if
not
as
riotously
as
any
of
them
at
the
wild
mirth
the
unbridled
license
the
amatory
recitations
and
the
bacchic
odes
in
their
lawless
sapir
that
had
ushered
the
night
in
while
his
wines
unlocked
the
tongues
and
flowed
down
the
throats
of
the
fierce
and
the
french
cavalrymen
but
now
he
leaned
out
of
the
casement
with
his
arms
folded
on
the
sill
and
a
short
pipe
in
his
teeth
thoughtful
and
solitary
after
the
orgy
whose
heavy
fumes
and
clouds
of
smoke
still
hung
heavily
on
the
air
within
the
window
looked
on
a
little
dull
close
courtyard
where
the
yellow
leaves
of
a
withered
gourd
trailed
drearily
over
the
gray
uneven
stones
the
clamor
of
the
applause
and
the
ring
of
the
music
from
the
echoed
with
a
whirling
din
in
his
ear
and
made
in
sharper
stranger
contrast
the
quiet
of
the
narrow
court
with
its
strip
of
starry
sky
above
its
four
high
walls
he
leaned
there
musing
and
grave
hearing
little
of
the
noise
about
him
there
was
always
noise
of
some
sort
in
the
clangor
and
tumult
of
barrack
or
bivouac
life
and
he
had
grown
to
heed
it
no
more
than
he
heeded
the
roar
of
desert
beasts
about
him
when
he
slept
in
the
desert
or
the
hills
but
looked
dreamily
out
at
the
little
shadowy
square
with
the
sear
gourd
leaves
and
the
rough
misshapen
stones
his
present
and
his
future
were
neither
much
brighter
than
the
gloomy
den
on
which
he
gazed
twelve
years
before
when
he
had
been
ordered
into
the
for
the
first
time
to
see
of
what
mettle
he
was
made
the
instructor
had
watched
him
with
amazed
eyes
muttering
to
himself
this
is
no
raw
recruit
this
fellow
what
a
rider
dieu
de
dieu
he
knows
more
than
we
can
teach
he
has
served
before
now
served
in
some
emperor
picked
guard
and
when
he
had
passed
from
the
to
the
campaign
the
army
had
found
him
one
of
the
most
splendid
of
its
many
splendid
soldiers
and
in
the
daily
folios
there
was
no
page
of
achievements
of
exploits
of
services
of
dangers
that
showed
a
more
brilliant
array
of
military
deserts
than
his
yet
for
many
years
he
had
been
passed
by
unnoticed
he
had
now
not
even
the
cross
on
his
chest
and
he
had
only
slowly
and
with
infinite
difficulty
been
promoted
so
far
as
he
stood
now
a
corporal
in
the
chasseurs
a
step
only
just
accorded
him
because
wounds
innumerable
and
distinctions
without
number
in
countless
skirmishes
had
made
it
impossible
to
cast
him
wholly
aside
any
longer
the
cause
lay
in
the
implacable
enmity
of
one
man
his
chief
as
they
were
by
position
and
rarely
as
they
could
come
into
actual
contact
that
merciless
weight
of
animosity
from
the
great
man
to
his
soldier
had
lain
on
the
other
like
iron
and
clogged
him
from
all
advancement
his
thoughts
were
of
it
now
only
at
an
inspection
the
accidentally
broken
of
a
had
furnished
pretext
for
a
furious
reprimand
a
volley
of
insolent
opprobrium
hurled
at
himself
under
which
he
had
had
to
sit
mute
in
his
saddle
with
no
other
sign
that
he
was
human
beneath
the
outrage
than
the
blood
that
would
despite
himself
flush
the
pale
bronze
of
his
forehead
his
thoughts
were
on
it
now
there
are
many
losses
that
are
bitter
enough
he
mused
but
there
is
not
one
so
bitter
as
the
loss
of
the
right
to
resent
a
whirlwind
of
laughter
so
loud
that
it
drowned
the
music
of
the
shrill
violins
and
thundering
drums
echoed
through
the
rooms
and
shook
him
from
his
reverie
they
are
bons
enfants
he
thought
with
a
half
smile
as
he
listened
they
are
more
honest
in
their
mirth
as
in
their
wrath
than
we
ever
were
in
that
old
world
of
amid
the
shouts
the
crash
the
tumult
the
gay
ringing
voice
of
cigarette
rose
distinct
she
had
apparently
paused
in
her
dancing
to
exchange
one
of
those
passes
of
arms
which
were
her
specialty
in
the
sabir
that
she
a
child
of
the
regiments
of
africa
had
known
as
her
mother
tongue
you
call
him
a
misanthrope
she
cried
disdainfully
and
you
have
been
drinking
at
his
expense
you
rascal
the
grumbled
assent
of
the
accused
was
inaudible
ingrate
pursued
the
scornful
triumphant
voice
of
the
vivandiere
you
would
pawn
your
mother
you
would
eat
your
children
en
fricassee
you
would
sell
your
father
bones
for
a
draught
of
brandy
the
screams
of
mirth
redoubled
cigarette
style
of
withering
eloquence
was
suited
to
all
her
auditors
tastes
and
under
the
chorus
of
laughs
at
his
cost
her
infuriated
adversary
plucked
up
courage
and
roared
forth
a
defiance
white
hands
and
a
brunette
face
are
fine
things
for
a
soldier
he
kills
women
he
kills
women
with
his
lady
grace
he
does
not
pull
their
ears
to
make
them
give
him
their
money
and
beat
them
with
a
stick
if
they
do
fry
his
eggs
fast
enough
as
you
do
retorted
the
contemptuous
tones
of
the
champion
of
the
absent
white
hands
morbleu
well
his
hands
are
not
always
in
other
people
pockets
as
yours
are
this
forcible
recrimination
is
in
high
relish
in
the
caserne
the
screams
of
mirth
redoubled
was
a
redoubtable
authority
whom
the
wildest
in
his
brigade
dared
not
contradict
and
he
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
under
the
lash
of
cigarette
tongue
to
the
infinite
glee
of
the
whole
ballroom
dame
his
hands
can
not
work
as
mine
can
growled
her
opponent
oh
ho
cried
the
little
lady
with
supreme
disdain
they
do
twist
cocks
throats
and
skin
rabbits
they
have
thieved
perhaps
like
yours
but
they
would
wring
your
neck
before
breakfast
to
get
an
appetite
if
they
could
touch
such
canaille
thundered
the
insulted
if
you
were
but
a
man
what
would
you
do
to
me
brigand
screamed
cigarette
in
fits
of
laughter
give
me
fifty
blows
of
a
stick
as
your
officers
gave
you
last
week
for
stealing
his
gun
from
a
new
soldier
a
growl
like
a
lion
from
the
badgered
shook
the
walls
she
had
cast
her
mischievous
stroke
at
him
on
a
very
sore
point
the
unhappy
young
conscript
rifle
having
been
first
dexterously
thieved
from
him
and
then
as
dexterously
sold
to
an
arab
sacre
bleu
he
roared
you
are
in
love
with
this
conqueror
of
women
this
soldier
aristocrat
the
only
answer
to
this
unbearable
insult
was
a
louder
tumult
of
laughter
a
crash
a
splash
and
a
volley
of
oaths
from
cigarette
had
launched
a
bottle
of
vin
ordinaire
at
him
blinded
his
eyes
and
drenched
his
beard
with
the
red
torrent
and
the
shower
of
glass
slivers
and
was
back
again
dancing
like
a
little
bacchante
and
singing
at
the
top
of
her
sweet
voice
at
the
sound
of
the
animated
altercation
not
knowing
but
what
one
of
his
own
troopers
might
be
the
delinquent
he
who
leaned
out
of
the
little
casement
moved
forward
to
the
doorway
of
the
dancing
room
he
did
not
guess
that
it
was
himself
whom
she
had
defended
against
the
onslaught
of
the
zephyr
his
height
rose
far
above
the
french
soldiers
and
above
most
even
of
the
spahis
and
her
rapid
glance
flashed
over
him
at
once
did
he
hear
she
wondered
the
scarlet
flush
of
exercise
and
excitement
deepened
on
her
clear
brown
cheek
that
had
never
blushed
at
the
coarsest
jests
or
the
broadest
love
words
of
the
that
had
been
about
her
ever
since
her
eyes
first
opened
in
her
infancy
to
laugh
at
the
on
a
cuirassier
corslet
among
the
that
her
mother
followed
she
thought
he
had
not
heard
his
face
was
grave
a
little
weary
and
his
gaze
as
it
fell
on
her
was
abstracted
oh
thought
cigarette
with
a
flash
of
hot
wrath
superseding
her
momentary
and
most
rare
embarrassment
you
are
looking
at
me
and
not
thinking
of
me
we
will
soon
change
that
such
an
insult
she
had
never
been
subjected
to
from
the
first
day
when
she
had
danced
for
sweetmeats
on
the
top
of
a
great
drum
when
she
was
three
years
old
in
the
middle
of
a
circular
camp
of
tirailleurs
it
sent
fresh
nerve
into
her
little
limbs
it
made
her
eyes
flash
like
so
much
fire
it
gave
her
a
millionfold
more
grace
more
abandon
more
heedlessness
she
stamped
her
tiny
spurred
foot
petulantly

quicker
she
cried
and
as
the
musician
obeyed
her
she
whirled
she
spun
she
bounded
she
seemed
to
live
in
air
while
her
soft
curls
blew
off
her
brow
and
her
white
teeth
glanced
and
her
cheeks
glowed
with
a
carmine
glow
and
the
little
gold
aiglettes
broke
across
her
chest
with
the
beating
of
her
heart
that
throbbed
like
a
bird
heart
when
it
is
wild
with
the
first
breath
of
spring
she
had
pitted
herself
against
him
and
she
won
so
far
the
vivacity
the
impetuosity
the
antelope
elegance
the
voluptuous
repose
that
now
and
then
broke
the
ceaseless
sparkling
movement
of
her
dancing
caught
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
her
it
was
bewitching
and
it
bewitched
him
for
the
moment
he
watched
her
as
in
other
days
he
had
watched
the
fantastic
witcheries
of
eastern
alme
and
the
ballet
charms
of
opera
dancers
this
young
bohemian
of
the
barrack
danced
in
the
dusky
glare
and
the
tavern
fumes
of
the
as
de
pique
to
a
set
of
soldiers
in
their
with
their
short
black
pipes
in
their
mouths
with
as
matchless
a
grace
as
ever
the
first
ballerinas
of
europe
danced
before
sovereigns
and
dukes
on
the
boards
of
paris
vienna
or
london
it
was
the
eastern
bamboula
of
the
harems
to
which
was
added
all
the
elastic
joyance
all
the
gay
brilliancy
of
the
blood
of
france
suddenly
she
lifted
both
her
hands
above
her
head
it
was
the
signal
well
known
the
signal
of
permission
to
join
in
that
wild
vertigo
for
which
every
one
of
her
spectators
was
panting
their
pipes
were
flung
away
their
kepis
tossed
off
their
heads
the
music
clashed
louder
and
faster
and
more
fiery
with
every
sound
the
chorus
of
the
marseillaise
des
bataillons
thundered
from
a
hundred
voices
they
danced
as
only
men
can
dance
who
serve
under
the
french
flag
and
live
under
the
african
sun
two
only
still
looked
on
the

and
a
veteran
of
the
company
lamed
for
life
at
mazagran
are
you
a
stupid
do
you
dance
muttered
the
veteran
zephyr
to
his
silent
companion
the
chasseur
turned
and
smiled
a
little
i
prefer
a
bamboula
whose
music
is

his
thoughts
went
to
a
woman
he
had
loved
well
a
young
arab
with
eyes
like
the
softness
of
dark
waters
who
had
fallen
to
him
once
in
a
razzia
as
his
share
of
spoil
and
for
whom
he
had
denied
himself
cards
or
wine
or
tobacco
or
an
hour
at
the
cafe
or
anything
that
alleviated
the
privation
and
severity
of
his
lot
as
simple
soldat
which
he
had
been
then
that
she
might
have
such
few
and
slender
comforts
as
he
could
give
her
from
his
miserable
pay
she
was
dead
her
death
had
been
the
darkest
passage
in
his
life
in
africa
but
the
music
of
her
voice
seemed
to
come
on
his
ear
now
this
had
little
charm
for
him
after
the
sweet
silent
tender
grace
of
his
lost
zelme
he
turned
and
touched
on
the
shoulder
a
chasseur
who
had
paused
a
moment
to
get
breath
in
the
headlong
whirl
come
we
are
to
be
with
the
djied
by
dawn
the
trooper
obeyed
instantly
they
were
ordered
to
visit
and
remain
with
a
bedouin
camp
some
thirty
miles
away
on
the
naked
plateau
a
camp
professedly
submissive
but
not
so
much
so
but
that
the
bureau
deemed
it
well
to
profit
themselves
by
the
services
of
the
corporal
whose
knowledge
of
arabic
whose
friendship
with
the
tribes
and
whose
superior
intelligence
in
all
such
missions
rendered
him
peculiarly
fitted
for
errands
that
required
diplomacy
and
address
as
well
as
daring
and
fire
he
went
thoughtfully
out
of
the
noisy
reeking
ballroom
into
the
warm
luster
of
the
algerian
night
as
he
went
cigarette
who
had
been
nearer
than
he
knew
flashed
full
in
his
eyes
the
fury
of
her
own
sparkling
ones
while
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
she
struck
him
on
the

with
the

hurled

him

were
spoken
with
the
fierceness
of

she
had
too
much
in
her
of
the
spirit
of
the
zephyrs
and
the
chacals
with
whom
her
youth
had
been
spent
from
her
cradle
up
not
to
be
dangerous
when
roused
she
was
off
at
a
bound
and
in
the
midst
of
the
mad
whirl
again
before
he
could
attempt
to
soften
or
efface
the
words
she
had
overheard
and
the
last
thing
he
saw
of
her
was
in
a
cloud
of
zouaves
and
spahis
with
the
wild
uproar
of
the
music
shaking
riotous
echoes
from
the
rafters
but
when
he
had
passed
out
of
sight
cigarette
shook
herself
free
from
the
dancers
with
petulant
impatience
she
was
not
to
be
allured
by
flattery
or
drawn
by
entreaty
back
amongst
them
she
set
her
delicate
pearly
teeth
tight
and
vowed
with
a
reckless
contemptuous
impetuous
oath
that
she
was
tired
that
she
was
sick
of
them
that
she
was
no
strolling
player
to
caper
for
them
with
a
tambourine
and
with
that
declaration
made
her
way
out
alone
into
the
little
open
court
under
the
stars
so
cool
so
still
after
the
heat
and
riot
and
turbulence
within
there
she
dropped
on
a
broad
stone
step
and
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
unsexed
unsexed

thought
while
for
the
first
time
with
a
vague
sense
of
his
meaning
tears
welled
hot
and
bitter
into
her
sunny
eyes
while
the
pained
color
burned
in
her
face
those
tears
were
the
first
that
she
had
ever
known
and
they
were
cruel
ones
though
they
lasted
but
a
little
time
there
was
too
much
fire
in
the
young
bohemian
of
the
army
not
to
scorch
them
as
they
rose
she
stamped
her
foot
on
the
stones
passionately
and
her
teeth
were
set
like
a
little
terrier
as

the

fell
over

longing
for
its

at

over

was

the

lay
enjoying
the
solemn
silence

they
love
so
little
to

and
smoking
their
long
pipes
while
through

about

with

burning
through

drifting
clouds
in
the
central
tent
tall
and
with
its
mighty
standard
reared
in
front
and
its
opening
free
to
the
night
sat
the
khalifa
the
head
of
the
tribe
with
a
circle
of
arabs
about
him
he
was
thrown
on
his
cushions
rich
enough
for
a
seraglio
while
the
rest
squatted
on
the
morocco
carpet
that
covered
the
bare
ground
and
that
was
strewn
with
round
brass
moorish
trays
and
little
cups
emptied
of
their
coffee
the
sides
of
the
tent
were
hung
with
guns
and
swords
lavishly
adorned
and
in
the
middle
stood
a
tall
turkish
in
fretted
work
whose
light
struggled
with
the
white
flood
of
the
moon
and
the
ruddy
fitful
glare
from
a
wood
fire
without
beneath
its
light
which
fell
full
on
him
flung
down
upon
another
pile
of
cushions
facing
the
open
front
of
the
tent
was
a
guest
whom
the
khalifa
delighted
to
honor
only
a
corporal
of
chasseurs
and
once
a
foe
yet
one
with
whom
the
arab
found
the
brotherhood
of
brave
men
and
on
whom
he
lavished
in
all
he
could
the
hospitalities
and
honors
of
the
desert
the
story
of
their
friendship
ran
thus
the
tribe
was
now
allied
with
france
or
at
least
had
accepted
french
sovereignty
and
pledged
itself
to
neutrality
in
the
hostilities
still
rife
but
a
few
years
before
far
in
the
interior
and
leagued
with
the
kabailes
it
had
been
one
of
the
fiercest
and
most
dangerous
among
the
enemies
of
france
at
that
time
the
khalifa
and
the
chasseur
met
in
many
a
skirmish
hot
desperate
struggles
where
men
fought
horse
to
horse
hand
to
hand
midnight
frays
when
in
the
heart
of
lonely
ravines
arab
ambuscades
fell
on
squadrons
of
french
cavalry
terrible
chases
through
the
heat
of
torrid
suns
when
the
glittering
ranks
of
the
charging
troops
swept
down
after
the
bedouins
flight
fiery
combats
when
the
desert
sand
and
the
smoke
of
musketry
circled
in
clouds
above
the
struggle
and
the
leopard
of
france
and
the
lion
of
sahara
wrestled
in
a
in
these
through
four
or
five
seasons
of
warfare
the
sheik
and
the
chasseur
had
encountered
each
other
till
each
had
grown
to
look
for
the
other
face
as
soon
as
the
standards
of
the
bedouins
flashed
in
the
sunshine
opposite
the
guidons
of
the
imperial
forces
till
each
had
watched
and
noted
the
other
unmatched
prowess
and
borne
away
the
wounds
of
the
other
with
the
admiration
of
a
bold
soldier
for
a
bold
rival
dauntlessness
and
skill
till
each
had
learned
to
long
for
an
hour
hitherto
always
prevented
by
waves
of
battle
that
had
swept
them
too
soon
asunder
when
they
should
meet
in
a
duello
once
for
all
and
try
their
strength
together
till
one
bore
off
victory
and
one
succumbed
to
death
at
last
it
came
to
pass
that
after
a
lengthened
term
of
this
chivalrous
antagonism
the
tribe
were
sorely
pressed
by
the
french
troops
and
could
no
longer
mass
its
fearless
front
to
face
them
but
had
to
flee
southward
to
the
desert
and
encumbered
by
its
flocks
and
its
women
was
hardly
driven
and
greatly
decimated
now
among
those
women
was
one
whom
the
sheik
held
above
all
earthly
things
except
his
honor
in
war
a
beautiful
creature
lithe
and
graceful
as
a
palm
and
the
daughter
of
a
pure
arab
race
on
whom
he
could
not
endure
for
any
other
sight
than
his
to
look
and
whom
he
guarded
in
his
tent
as
the
chief
pearl
of
all
his
treasures
herds
flocks
arms
even
his
horses
all
save
the
honor
of
his
tribe
he
would
have
surrendered
rather
than
surrender
djelma
it
was
a
passion
with
him
a
passion
that
not
even
the
iron
of
his
temper
and
the
dignity
of
his
austere
calm
could
abate
or
conceal
and
the
rumor
of
it
and
of
the
beauty
of
its
object
reached
the
french
camp
till
an
impatient
curiosity
was
roused
about
her
and
a
raid
that
should
bear
her
off
became
the
favorite
speculation
round
the
picket
fires
at
night
and
in
the
scorching
noons
when
the
men
lay
stripped
to
their
waist
panting
like
tired
dogs
under
the
hot
withering
breath
that
stole
to
them
sweeping
over
the
yellow
seas
of
sands
their
heated
fancies
had
pictured
this
treasure
of
the
great
djied
as
something
beyond
all
that
her
sex
had
ever
given
them
and
to
snare
her
in
some
unwary
moment
was
the
chief
thought
of
zephyr
and
spahi
when
they
went
out
on
a
scouting
or
foraging
party
but
it
was
easier
said
than
done
the
eyes
of
no
frank
ever
fell
on
her
and
when
he
was
most
closely
driven
the
khalifa
ilderim
abandoned
his
cattle
and
sheep
but
with
the
females
of
the
tribe
still
safely
guarded
fell
more
and
more
backward
and
southward
drawing
the
french
on
and
on
farther
and
farther
across
the
plains
in
the
sickliest
times
of
hottest
drought
could
swell
the
imperial
ranks
as
swiftly
as
they
were
thinned
but
with
the
arabs
a
man
once
fallen
was
a
man
the
less
to
their
numbers
forever
and
the
pursuit
began
to
tell
terribly
on
them
their
herds
had
fallen
into
their
pursuers
hands
and
famine
menaced
them
nevertheless
they
were
fierce
in
attack
as
tigers
rapid
in
swoop
as
vultures
and
fought
flying
in
such
fashion
that
the
cavalry
lost
more
in
this
fruitless
worthless
work
than
they
would
have
done
in
a
second
hohenlinden
or
austerlitz
moreover
the
heat
was
intense
water
was
bad
and
very
rare
dysentery
came
with
the
scorch
and
the
toil
of
this
endless
charge
the
chief
in
command
le
marquis
de
chateauroy
swore
heavily
as
he
saw
many
of
his
best
men
dropping
off
like
sheep
in
a
murrain
and
he
offered
two
hundred
napoleons
to
whosoever
should
bring
either
the
dead
sheik
head
or
the
living
beauty
of
djelma
one
day
the
chasseurs
had
pitched
their
camp
where
a
few
barren
withered
trees
gave
a
semblance
of
shelter
and
a
little
thread
of
brackish
water
oozed
through
the
yellow
earth
it
was
high
noon
the
african
sun
was
at
its
fiercest
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
there
was
only
one
boundless
burning
unendurable
glitter
of
parching
sand
and
cloudless
sky
brazen
beneath
brazen
above
till
the
desert
and
the
heavens
touched
and
blent
in
one
tawny
fiery
glow
in
the
measureless
distance
the
men
lay
under
canvas
without
the
power
to
do
anything
except
to
fight
like
dogs
for
a
draught
at
the
shallow
stream
that
they
and
their
breathless
horses
soon
drained
dry
even
raoul
de
chateauroy
though
his
frame
was
like
an
arab
and
knit
into
arab
endurance
was
stretched
like
a
great
bloodhound
chained
by
the
sultry
oppression
he
was
ruthless
inflexible
a
tyrant
to
the
core
and
sharp
and
swift
as
steel
in
his
rigor
but
he
was
a
fine
soldier
and
never
spared
himself
any
of
the
hardships
that
his
regiment
had
to
endure
under
him
suddenly
the
noon
lethargy
of
the
camp
was
broken
a
rang
through
the
stillness
against
the
amber
transparency
of
the
horizon
line
the
outlines
of
half
a
dozen
horsemen
were
seen
looming
nearer
and
nearer
with
every
moment
they
were
some
spahis
who
had
been
out
sweeping
the
country
for
food
the
mighty
frame
of
chateauroy
almost
as
unclothed
as
an
athlete
started
from
its
slumberous
panting
rest
his
eyes
lightened
hungrily
he
muttered
a
fiery
oath
mort
de
dieu
they
have
the
woman
they
had
the
woman
she
had
been
netted
near
a
to
which
she
had
wandered
too
loosely
guarded
and
too
far
from
the
bedouin
encampment
the
delight
of
the
haughty
sidi
eyes
was
borne
off
to
the
tents
of
his
foe
and
the
colonel
face
flushed
darkly
with
an
eager
lustful
warmth
as
he
looked
upon
his
captive
rumor
had
not
outboasted
the
arab
girl
beauty
it
was
lustrous
as
ever
was
that
when
far
yonder
to
the
eastward
under
the
curled
palms
of
nile
the
sorceress
of
the
caesars
swept
through
her
palace
chambers
only
djelma
was
as
innocent
as
the
gazelle
whose
grace
she
resembled
and
loved
her
lord
with
a
great
love
of
her
suffering
her
captor
took
no
more
heed
than
if
she
were
a
young
bird
dying
of
but
with
one
triumphant
admiring
glance
at
her
he
wrote
a
message
in
arabic
to
send
to
the
khalifa
ere
her
loss
was
discovered
a
message
more
cruel
than
iron
he
hesitated
a
second
where
he
lay
at
the
opening
of
his
tent
whom
he
should
send
with
it
his
men
were
almost
all
with
the
his
glance
chanced
to
light
in
the
distance
on
a
soldier
to
whom
he
bore
no
love
causelessly
but
bitterly
all
the
same
he
had
him
summoned
and
eyed
him
with
a
curious
amusement
chateauroy
treated
his
squadrons
with
much
the
same
familiarity
and
brutality
that
a
chief
of
filibusters
uses
in
his
so
you
heed
the
heat
so
little
you
give
up
your
turn
of
water
to
a
drummer
they
say
the
chasseur
gave
the
salute
with
a
calm
deference
a
faint
flush
passed
over
the
of
his
forehead
he
had
thought
the
sacrifice
had
been
unobserved
the
drummer
was
but
a
child
mon
be
so
good
as
to
give
us
no
more
of
those
melodramatic
acts
said
le
marquis
contemptuously
you
are
too
fond
of
trafficking
in
those
showy
fooleries
you
bribe
your
comrades
for
their
favoritism
too
openly
ventre
bleu
i
forbid
it
do
you
hear
i
hear
mon
the
assent
was
perfectly
tranquil
and
respectful
he
was
too
good
a
soldier
not
to
render
perfect
obedience
and
keep
perfect
silence
under
any
goad
of
provocation
to
break
both
obey
then
said
chateauroy
savagely
well
since
you
love
heat
so
well
you
shall
take
a
flag
of
truce
and
my
scroll
to
the
sidi
ilderim
but
tell
me
first
what
do
you
think
of
this
capture
it
is
not
my
place
to
give
opinions
le
pardieu
it
is
your
place
when
i
bid
you
speak
or
i
will
have
the
stick
cut
the
words
out
of
you
i
may
speak
frankly
ten
thousand
curses
yes
then
i
think
that
those
who
make
war
on
women
are
no
longer
fit
to
fight
with
for
a
moment
the
long
sinewy
massive
form
of
chateauroy
started
from
the
skins
on
which
he
lay
at
full
length
like
a
lion
started
from
its
lair
his
veins
swelled
like
black
cords
under
the
mighty
muscle
of
his
bare
chest
his
heart
beat
visibly
in
the
fury
of
his
wrath
by
god
i
have
a
mind
to
have
you
shot
like
a
dog
the
chasseur
looked
at
him
carelessly
composedly
but
with
a
serene
deference
still
as
due
from
a
soldier
to
his
chief
you
have
threatened
it
before
le
colonel
it
may
be
as
well
to
do
it
or
the
army
may
think
you
raoul
de
chateauroy
crushed
a
blasphemous
oath
through
his
clinched
teeth
and
laughed
a
certain
short
stern
sardonic
laugh
which
his
men
dreaded
more
than
his
wrath
no
i
will
send
you
instead
to
the
khalifa
he
often
saves
me
the
trouble
of
killing
my
own
curs
take
a
flag
of
truce
and
this
paper
and
never
draw
rein
till
you
reach
him
if
your
beast
drop
dead
at
the
the
chasseur
saluted
took
the
paper
bowed
with
a
certain
languid
easy
grace
that
camp
life
never
cured
him
of
and
went
he
knew
that
the
man
who
should
take
the
news
of
his
treasure
loss
to
the
emir
ilderim
would
a
thousand
to
one
perish
by
every
torture
desert
cruelty
could
frame
despite
the
cover
of
the
white
banner
chateauroy
looked
after
him
as
he
and
his
horse
passed
from
the
french
camp
in
the
full
burning
tide
of
noon
if
the
arabs
kill
him
he
thought
i
will
forgive
ilderim
five
seasons
of
the
chasseur
as
he
had
been
bidden
never
drew
rein
across
the
scorching
plateau
he
rode
to
what
he
knew
was
like
enough
to
be
death
and
death
by
many
a
torment
as
though
he
rode
to
a
midnight
his
horse
was
of
arab
breed
young
fleet
and
able
to
endure
extraordinary
pressure
both
of
spur
and
of
heat
he
swept
on
far
and
fast
through
the
sickly
lurid
glitter
of
the
day
over
the
loose
sand
that
flew
in
puffs
around
him
as
the
hoofs
struck
it
flying
right
and
left
at
last
ere
he
reached
the
bedouin
tents
that
were
still
but
slender
black
points
against
the
horizon
he
saw
the
sheik
and
a
party
of
horsemen
returning
from
a
foraging
quest
and
in
ignorance
as
yet
of
the
abduction
of
djelma
he
galloped
straight
to
them
and
halted
across
their
line
of
march
with
the
folds
of
the
little
white
flag
fluttering
in
the
sun
the
bedouins
drew
bridle
and
ilderim
advanced
alone
he
was
a
magnificent
man
of
middle
age
with
the
noblest
type
of
the
aquiline
desert
beauty
he
was
a
superb
specimen
of
his
race
without
the
lean
withered
rapacious
vulture
look
which
often
mars
it
his
white
haik
floated
round
limbs
fit
for
a
colossus
and
under
the
snowy
folds
of
his
turban
the
of
his
bold
forehead
the
sweep
of
his
beard
and
the
piercing
luminance
of
his
eyes
had
a
grand
and
kingly
majesty
a
glance
of
recognition
from
him
on
the
lascar
who
had
so
often
crossed
swords
with
him
and
he
waved
back
the
scroll
with
dignified
courtesy
read
it
it
was
read
bitterly
blackly
shameful
the
few
brutal
words
were
they
netted
him
as
an
eagle
is
netted
in
a
shepherd
trap
the
moment
that
he
gave
a
sign
of
advancing
against
his
ravishers
the
captive
life
would
pay
the
penalty
if
he
merely
remained
in
arms
without
direct
attack
she
would
be
made
the
marquis
mistress
and
abandoned
later
to
the
army
the
only
terms
on
which
he
could
have
her
restored
were
instant
submission
to
the
imperial
rule
and
personal
homage
of
himself
and
all
his
djouad
to
the
marquis
as
the
representatives
of
france
homage
in
which
they
should
confess
themselves
dogs
and
the
sons
of
dogs
so
ran
the
message
of
peace
the
chasseur
read
on
to
the
end
calmly
then
he
lifted
his
gaze
and
looked
at
the
emir
he
expected
fifty
swords
to
be
buried
in
his
heart
as
he
gazed
he
thought
no
more
of
his
own
doom
he
thought
only
of
the
revelation
before
him
of
what
passion
and
what
agony
could
be
things
unknown
in
the
world
where
the
chief
portion
of
his
life
had
passed
he
was
a
campaigner
trained
in
the
ruthless
school
of
african
hostilities
who
had
seen
every
shape
of
mental
and
physical
suffering
when
men
were
left
to
perish
of
as
the
rush
of
the
charge
swept
on
when
writhing
horses
died
by
the
score
of
famine
and
of
thirst
when
the
firebrand
was
hurled
among
sleeping
encampments
and
defenseless
women
were
torn
from
their
rest
by
the
unsparing
hands
of
pitiless
soldiers
but
the
torture
which
shook
for
a
second
the
frame
of
this
arab
passed
all
that
he
had
dreamed
as
possible
it
was
mute
and
held
in
bonds
of
iron
for
the
sake
of
the
desert
pride
of
a
great
ruler
majesty
but
it
spoke
more
than
any
eloquence
ever
spoke
yet
on
earth
with
a
wild
shrill
yell
the
bedouins
whirled
their
naked
sabers
above
their
heads
and
rushed
down
on
the
bearer
of
this
shame
to
their
chief
and
their
tribe
the
chasseur
did
not
seek
to
defend
himself
he
sat
motionless
he
thought
the
vengeance
just
the
sheik
raised
his
sword
and
signed
them
back
as
he
pointed
to
the
white
folds
of
the
flag
then
his
voice
rolled
out
like
thunder
over
the
stillness
of
the
plains
but
that
you
trust
yourself
to
my
honor
i
would
rend
you
limb
from
limb
go
back
to
the
tiger
who
rules
you
and
tell
him
that
as
allah
liveth
i
will
fall
on
him
and
smite
him
as
he
hath
never
been
smitten
dead
or
living
i
will
have
back
my
own
if
he
take
her
life
i
will
have
ten
thousand
lives
to
answer
it
if
he
deal
her
dishonor
i
will
light
such
a
holy
war
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
that
his
nation
shall
be
driven
backward
like
choked
dogs
into
the
sea
and
perish
from
the
face
of
the
earth
for
evermore
and
this
i
swear
by
the
law
and
the
prophet
the
menace
rolled
out
imperious
as
a
monarch
thrilling
through
the
desert
hush
the
chasseur
bent
his
head
as
the
words
closed
his
own
teeth
were
tightly
clinched
and
his
face
was
dark
emir
listen
to
one
word
he
said
briefly
shame
has
been
done
to
me
as
to
you
had
i
been
told
what
words
i
bore
they
had
never
been
brought
by
my
hand
you
know
me
you
have
had
the
marks
of
my
steel
as
i
have
had
the
marks
of
yours
trust
me
in
this
sidi
i
pledge
you
my
honor
that
before
the
sun
sets
she
shall
be
given
back
to
you
unharmed
or
i
will
return
here
myself
and
your
tribe
shall
slay
me
in
what
fashion
they
will
so
alone
can
she
be
saved
uninjured
answer
will
you
have
faith
in
me
the
desert
chief
looked
at
him
long
sitting
motionless
as
a
statue
on
his
stallion
with
the
fierce
gleam
of
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
so
long
had
been
his
foe
in
contests
whose
chivalry
equaled
their
daring
the
chasseur
never
wavered
once
under
the
set
piercing
ruthless
gaze
then
the
emir
pointed
to
the
sun
that
was
not
at
its
zenith
you
are
a
great
warrior
such
men
do
not
lie
go
and
if
she
be
borne
to
me
before
the
sun
is
sunk
toward
the
west
all
the
branches
of
the
tribes
of
ilderim
shall
be
as
your
brethren
and
bend
as
steel
to
your
bidding
if
not
as
god
is
mighty
not
one
man
in
all
your
host
shall
live
to
tell
the
tale
the
chasseur
bowed
his
head
to
his
horse
mane
then
without
a
word
wheeled
round
and
sped
back
across
the
plain
when
he
reached
his
own
cavalry
camp
he
went
straightway
to
his
chief
what
passed
between
them
none
ever
knew
the
interview
was
brief
it
was
possibly
as
stormy
pregnant
and
decisive
it
assuredly
was
and
the
squadrons
of
africa
marveled
that
the
man
who
dared
beard
raoul
de
chateauroy
in
his
lair
came
forth
with
his
life
whatever
the
spell
he
used
the
result
was
a
marvel
at
the
very
moment
that
the
sun
touched
the
lower
half
of
the
western
heavens
the
sheik
ilderim
where
he
sat
in
his
saddle
with
all
his
tribe
stretching
behind
him
to
sweep
down
like
falcons
on
the
spoilers
if
the
hour
passed
with
the
pledge
unredeemed
saw
the
form
of
the
chasseur
reappear
between
his
sight
and
the
glare
of
the
skies
nor
did
he
ride
alone
that
night
the
pearl
of
the
desert
lay
once
more
in
the
mighty
sinuous
arms
of
the
great
emir
but
with
the
dawn
his
vengeance
fell
in
terrible
fashion
on
the
sleeping
camp
of
the
franks
and
from
that
hour
dated
the
passionate
savage
unconcealed
hate
of
raoul
de
chateauroy
for
the
most
daring
soldier
of
all
his
fiery
horse
known
in
his
troop
as
it
was
in
the
tent
of
ilderim
now
that
he
reclined
looking
outward
at
the
night
where
flames
were
leaping
ruddily
under
a
large
caldron
and
far
beyond
was
the
dark
immensity
of
the
sky
the
light
of
the
moon
strayed
in
and
fell
on
the
chestnut
waves
of
his
beard
out
of
which
the
long
amber
stem
of
an
arab
pipe
glittered
like
a
golden
line
and
on
the
skin
fair
despite
a
warm
hue
of
bronze
and
the
long
slumberous
softness
of
the
hazel
eyes
were
in
so
marked
a
contrast
of
race
with
the
eagle
outlines
of
the
bedouins
around
from
the
hour
of
the
restoration
of
his
treasure
the
sheik
had
been
true
to
his
oath
his
tribe
in
all
its
branches
had
held
the
french
lascar
in
closest
brotherhood
wherever
they
were
he
was
honored
and
welcomed
was
he
in
war
their
swords
were
drawn
for
him
was
he
in
need
their
houses
of
hair
were
spread
for
him
had
he
want
of
flight
the
swiftest
and
most
precious
of
their
horses
was
at
his
service
had
he
thirst
they
would
have
died
themselves
wringing
out
the
last
drop
from
the
for
him
through
him
their
alliance
or
more
justly
to
speak
their
neutrality
was
secured
to
france
and
the
bedouin
chief
loved
him
with
a
great
silent
noble
love
that
was
fast
rooted
in
the
granite
of
his
nature
between
them
there
was
a
brotherhood
that
beat
down
the
antagonism
of
race
and
was
stronger
than
the
instinctive
hate
of
the
oppressed
for
all
who
came
under
the
abhorred
standard
of
the
usurpers
he
liked
the
arabs
and
they
liked
him
a
grave
courtesy
a
preference
for
the
fewest
words
and
least
demonstration
possible
a
marked
opinion
that
silence
was
golden
and
that
speech
was
at
best
only
metal
an
instinctive
dread
of
all
discovery
of
emotion
and
a
limitless
power
of
resisting
and
suppressing
suffering
were
qualities
the
nomads
of
the
desert
and
the
lion
of
the
chasseurs
had
in
common
as
they
had
in
unison
a
wild
passion
for
war
a
dauntless
zest
in
danger
and
a
love
for
the
hottest
heat
of
fiercest
battle
silence
reigned
in
the
tent
beyond
whose
first
division
screened
by
a
heavy
curtain
of
goat
hair
the
beautiful
young
djelma
played
with
her
only
son
a
child
of
three
or
four
summers
the
sheik
lay
mute
the
djouad
and
marabouts
around
never
spoke
in
his
presence
unless
their
lord
bade
them
and
the
chasseur
was
stretched
motionless
his
elbow
resting
on
a
cushion
of
morocco
fabric
and
his
eyes
looking
outward
at
the
restless
changing
movement
of
the
firelit
starlit
camp
after
the
noise
the
mirth
the
riotous
songs
and
the
gay
elastic
good
humor
of
his
french
comrades
the
silence
and
the
calm
of
the
house
of
hair
were
welcome
to
him
he
never
spoke
much
himself
of
a
truth
his
gentle
immutable
laconism
was
the
only
charge
that
his
comrades
ever
brought
against
him
that
a
man
could
be
so
brief
in
words
while
yet
so
soft
in
manner
seemed
a
thing
out
of
all
nature
to
the
vivacious
frenchmen
that
unchanging
stillness
and
serenity
in
one
who
was
such
a
reckless
resistless
swift
as
fire
in
the
field
was
an
enigma
that
the
cavalry
and
the
of
algeria
never
solved
his
corps
would
have
gone
after
him
to
the
devil
as
claude
de
chanrellon
had
averred
but
they
would
sometimes
wax
a
little
impatient
that
he
would
never
grow
communicative
or
thread
many
phrases
together
even
over
the
best
wine
which
ever
warmed
the
hearts
of
its
drinkers
or
loosened
all
rein
from
their
lips
i
wish
i
had
come
straight
to
you
sidi
when
i
first
set
foot
in
africa
he
said
at
last
while
the
fragrant
smoke
uncurled
from
under
the
droop
of
his
long
pendent
mustaches
truly
it
had
been
well
answered
the
khalifa
who
would
have
given
the
best
stallions
in
his
stud
to
have
had
this
frank
with
him
in
warfare
and
in
peace
there
is
no
life
like
our
faith
i
think
not
murmured
the
chasseur
rather
to
himself
than
the
bedouin
the
desert
keeps
you
and
your
horse
and
you
can
let
all
the
rest
of
the
world
but
we
are
murderers
and
pillagers
say
your
nations
resumed
the
emir
with
the
shadow
of
a
sardonic
smile
flickering
an
instant
over
the
sternness
and
composure
of
his
features
to
rifle
a
caravan
is
a
crime
though
to
steal
a
continent
is
laughed
slightly
do
not
tempt
me
to
rebel
against
my
adopted
the
sheik
looked
at
him
in
silence
the
french
soldiers
had
spent
twelve
years
in
the
ceaseless
exertions
of
an
amused
inquisitiveness
to
discover
the
antecedents
of
their
volunteer
the
arabs
with
their
loftier
instincts
of
courtesy
had
never
hinted
to
him
a
question
of
whence
or
why
he
had
come
upon
african
soil
i
never
thought
at
all
in
those
days
else
had
i
thought
twice
i
should
not
have
gone
to
your
enemies
he
answered
as
he
lazily
watched
the
bedouins
without
squat
on
their
heels
round
the
huge
brass
bowls
of
couscoussou
which
they
kneaded
into
round
lumps
and
pitched
between
their
open
bearded
lips
in
their
customary
form
of
supper
not
but
what
our
roumis
are
brave
fellows
enough
better
comrades
no
man
could
the
khalifa
took
the
long
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
spoke
his
slow
sonorous
accents
falling
melodiously
on
the
silence
in
the
lingua
sapir
of
the
tongue
your
comrades
are
gallant
men
they
are
great
warriors
and
fearless
foes
against
such
my
voice
is
never
lifted
however
my
sword
may
cross
with
them
but
the
that
devour
the
land
are
the
the
petty
despots
the
the
men
who
wring
gold
out
of
infamy
who
traffic
in
tyrannies
who
plunder
under
official
seals
who
curse
algiers
with
avarice
with
fraud
with
routine
with
the
of
civilization
it
is
the
as
your
tongue
phrases
it
that
is
the
spoiler
and
the
oppressor
of
the
soil
but
we
endure
only
for
a
while
a
little
and
the
shame
of
the
invader
tread
will
be
washed
out
in
blood
allah
is
great
we
can
and
with
moslem
patience
that
the
fiery
gloom
of
his
burning
eyes
belied
the
djied
stretched
himself
once
more
into
immovable
and
silent
rest
the
chasseur
answered
nothing
his
sympathies
were
heartfelt
with
the
arabs
his
allegiance
and
his
esprit
de
corps
were
with
the
service
in
which
he
was
enrolled
he
could
not
defend
french
usurpation
but
neither
could
he
condemn
the
flag
that
had
now
become
his
flag
and
in
which
he
had
grown
to
feel
much
of
national
honor
to
take
much
of
national
pride
they
will
never
really
win
again
i
am
afraid
he
thought
as
his
eyes
followed
the
flash
of
the
white
burnous
as
the
bedouins
glided
to
and
fro
in
the
of
the
encampment
now
in
the
flicker
of
the
flames
now
in
the
silvered
luster
of
the
moon
it
is
the
conflict
of
the
races
as
the
cant
runs
and
their
day
is
done
it
is
a
bolder
freer
simpler
type
than
anything
we
get
in
the
world
yonder
shall
we
ever
drift
back
to
it
in
the
future
i
wonder
the
speculation
did
not
stay
with
him
long
semitic
latin
or
teuton
race
was
very
much
the
same
to
him
and
intellectual
subtleties
had
not
much
attraction
at
any
time
for
the
most
brilliant
soldier
in
the
french
cavalry
he
preferred
the
ring
of
the
trumpets
the
glitter
of
the
play
along
the
line
of
steel
as
his
regiment
formed
in
line
on
the
eve
of
a
struggle
the
wild
breathless
sweep
of
a
midnight
gallop
over
the
brown
swelling
plateau
under
the
light
of
the
stars
or
in
some
brief
interval
of
indolence
and
wealth
the
gleam
of
fair
eyes
and
the
flush
of
sparkling
sherbet
when
some
passionate
darkling
glance
beamed
on
him
from
some
arab
mistress
whose
scarlet
lips
murmured
to
him
through
the
drowsy
hush
of
an
algerine
night
the
sense
if
not
the
song
of
pelagia
life
is
so
short
at
best
take
while
thou
canst
thy
rest
sleeping
by
me
his
thoughts
drifted
back
over
many
varied
scenes
and
changing
memories
of
his
service
in
algiers
as
he
lay
there
at
the
entrance
of
the
sheik
tent
with
the
night
of
looming
shadow
and
reddened
firelight
and
picturesque
movement
before
him
hours
of
reckless
headlong
delight
when
men
grew
drunk
with
bloodshed
as
with
wine
hours
of
horrible
unsuccored
suffering
when
the
desert
thirst
had
burned
in
his
throat
and
the
jagged
lances
been
broken
off
at
the
hilt
in
his
flesh
while
the
carrion
birds
wheeled
waiting
their
meal
hours
of
unceasing
unsparing
slaughter
when
the
word
was
given
to
slay
and
yield
no
mercy
where
in
the
great
vaulted
cavernous
gloom
of
rent
rocks
the
doomed
were
hemmed
as
close
as
sheep
in
shambles
hours
in
the
warm
flush
of
an
african
dawn
when
the
arbiter
of
the
duel
was
the
sole
judge
allowed
or
comprehended
by
the
tigers
of
the
tricolor
and
to
aim
a
dead
shot
or
to
receive
one
was
the
only
alternative
left
as
the
challenging
eyes
of
zephir
or
flashed
death
across
the
barriere
in
a
combat
where
only
one
might
live
though
the
root
of
the
quarrel
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
toss
too
much
of
brandy
a
puff
of
tobacco
smoke
construed
into
insult
or
a
fille
de
joie
maliciously
cast
of
taunt
or
laugh
hours
of
severe
discipline
of
relentless
routine
of
bitter
deprivation
of
campaigns
hard
as
steel
in
the
endurance
they
needed
in
the
miseries
they
entailed
of
military
subjection
stern
and
unbending
a
yoke
of
iron
that
a
personal
and
pitiless
tyranny
weighted
with
persecution
that
was
scarce
else
than
hatred
of
an
implicit
obedience
that
required
every
instinct
of
liberty
every
habit
of
early
life
every
impulse
of
pride
and
manhood
and
freedom
to
be
choked
down
like
crimes
and
buried
as
though
they
had
never
been
hours
again
that
repaid
these
in
full
when
the
long
line
of
horse
swept
out
to
the
attack
with
the
sun
on
the
points
of
their
weapons
when
the
wheeling
clouds
of
arab
riders
poured
like
the
clouds
of
the
simoon
on
a
thinned
devoted
troop
that
rallied
and
fought
as
hawks
fight
herons
and
saved
the
day
as
the
sky
was
flushed
with
that
day
decline
when
some
captive
with
limbs
of
free
mountain
grace
and
the
warm
veins
flushing
under
the
clear
olive
of
her
cheeks
was
first
wild
as
a
young
fettered
falcon
and
then
like
the
falcon
quickly
learned
to
tremble
at
a
touch
and
grow
tame
under
a
caress
and
love
nothing
so
well
as
the
hand
that
had
captured
her
hours
of
all
the
chanceful
fortunes
of
a
soldier
life
in
and
desert
raids
passed
in
memory
through
his
thoughts
now
where
he
was
stretched
looking
dreamily
through
the
film
of
his
smoke
at
the
city
of
tents
and
the
reclining
forms
of
camels
and
the
tall
white
slowly
moving
shapes
of
the
lawless
marauders
of
the
sand
plains
is
my
life
worth
much
more
under
the
french
flag
than
it
was
under
the
english
thought
the
chasseur
with
a
certain
careless
indifferent
irony
on
himself
natural
to
him
there
i
killed
time
here
i
kill
men
which
is
the
better
pursuit
i
wonder
the
world
would
rather
economize
the
first
commodity
than
the
last
i
believe
perhaps
it
do
make
an
overgood
use
of
the
night
was
someway
spent
when
the
talk
of
mares
and
sorrel
stallions
closed
between
the
djied
and
his
guest
and
the
french
soldier
who
had
been
sent
hither
from
the
bureau
with
another
of
his
comrades
took
his
way
through
the
now
still
camp
where
the
cattle
were
sleeping
and
the
fires
were
burning
out
and
the
hung
motionless
in
the
luster
of
the
stars
to
the
tent
prepared
for
him
a
spacious
one
close
to
the
chief
and
given
such
luxury
in
the
shape
of
ornamented
weapons
thick
carpets
and
soft
cushions
as
the
tribe
resources
could
bring
together
as
he
opened
the
folds
and
entered
his
who
was
lying
on
his
back
with
his
heels
much
higher
than
his
head
and
a
short
pipe
in
his
teeth
tumbled
himself
up
with
a
rapid
somersault
and
stood
bolt
upright
giving
the
salute
a
short
sturdy
little
man
with
a
skin
burnt
like
a
that
was
in
odd
contrast
with
his
light
dancing
blue
eyes
and
his
close
matted
curls
of
yellow
hair
beg
pardon
sir
i
was
half
asleep
the
chasseur
laughed
a
little
do
talk
english
somebody
will
hear
you
one
what
the
odds
if
they
do
sir
responded
the
other
it
relieves
one
feelings
a
little
all
of
know
i
english
but
never
a
one
of
know
what
you
are
the
name
you
was
enrolled
by
wo
really
tell
nothing
they
guess
it
ai
yours
that
cute
little
chap
tata
he
says
to
me
yesterday
always
of
your
galonne
like
as
if
he
was
a
prince
says
i
like
to
see
the
prince
as
would
hold
a
candle
to
him
right
there
says
the
little
ai
his
equal
for
taking
off
a
beggar
head
with
a
back
sweep
the
corporal
laughed
a
little
again
as
he
tossed
himself
down
on
the
carpet
well
it
something
to
have
one
virtue
but
have
a
care
what
those
get
out
of
lord
sir
ai
i
been
care
these
ten
years
it
comes
quite
natural
now
i
could
keep
my
tongue
still
that
would
be
in
anyways
possible
so
i
let
it
run
on
oiled
wheels
on
a
thousand
rum
tracks
and
doublings
i
told
such
a
lot
of
amazing
stories
about
where
we
come
from
that
they
got
half
a
million
different
styles
to
choose
out
of
some
thinks
as
how
you
a
polish
nob
what
got
into
hot
water
with
the
russians
some
as
how
you
a
italian
prince
what
was
cleaned
out
like
parma
and
them
was
some
as
how
you
a
austrian
archduke
that
have
cut
your
country
because
you
was
in
love
with
the
empress
and
had
a
duel
about
her
that
scandalized
the
whole
empire
some
as
how
you
a
exiled
spanish
grandee
to
learn
tactics
and
that
like
that
you
may
go
back
and
pitch
into
the
middle
of
next
week
whenever
you
see
a
chance
to
cut
in
and
try
conclusions
with
him
bless
you
sir
you
may
let
me
alone
for
bamboozling
of
the
corporal
laughed
again
as
he
began
to
unharness
himself
there
was
in
him
a
certain
mingling
of
insouciance
and
melancholy
each
of
which
alternately
predominated
the
former
his
by
nature
the
latter
born
of
circumstances
if
you
can
outwit
our
friends
the
zephyrs
you
have
reached
a
height
of
diplomacy
indeed
i
would
not
engage
to
do
it
myself
take
my
word
for
it
ingenuity
is
always
dangerous
silence
is
always
that
may
be
sir
responded
the
chasseur
in
the
sturdy
english
with
which
his
bright
blue
eyes
danced
a
fitting
nationality
no
doubt
uncommon
good
for
them
as
can
bring
their
minds
to
it
just
like
water
instead
o
wine
but
it
very
trying
like
the
teetotalism
you
might
as
well
tell
a
newfoundland
not
to
love
a
splash
as
me
not
to
love
a
chatter
i
cut
my
tongue
out
sooner
than
say
never
a
word
that
you
do
wish
but
say
something
i
must
or
die
for
with
which
the
speaker
known
to
algerian
fame
by
the
sobriquet
of
from
the
escapes
and
reckless
razzias
from
which
he
had
come
out
without
a
scratch
dropped
on
his
knees
and
began
to
take
off
the
trappings
of
his
with
as
reverential
a
service
as
though
he
were
a
lord
of
the
bedchamber
serving
a
louis
quatorze
the
other
motioned
him
gently
away
no
no
i
have
told
you
a
thousand
times
we
are
comrades
and
equals
and
i
told
you
a
thousand
times
sir
that
we
are
and
never
will
be
and
do
ought
to
be
replied
the
soldier
doggedly
drawing
off
the
spurred
and
boots
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
let
alone
what
straits
he
fall
but
ceases
to
be
one
as
soon
as
he
takes
a
service
he
can
not
requite
or
claims
a
superiority
he
does
not
possess
we
have
been
for
twelve
years
so
we
have
sir
but
we
are
what
we
always
was
and
always
will
be
one
a
gentleman
the
other
a
scamp
if
you
think
so
be
as
i
done
a
good
thing
side
by
side
with
you
now
and
then
in
the
fighting
give
me
my
own
way
and
let
me
wait
on
you
when
i
can
i
ca
do
much
on
it
when
those
other
fellow
eyes
is
on
us
but
here
i
can
and
i
will
begging
your
pardon
so
there
an
end
of
it
one
may
speak
plain
in
this
place
with
nothing
but
them
arabs
about
and
all
the
army
know
well
enough
sir
that
if
it
were
for
that
black
devil
chateauroy
you
have
had
your
officer
commission
and
your
troop
too
long
before
now
oh
no
there
are
scores
of
men
in
the
ranks
merit
promotion
better
far
than
i
do
and
leave
the
colonel
name
alone
he
is
our
chief
whatever
else
he
the
words
were
calm
and
careless
but
they
carried
a
weight
with
them
that
was
not
to
be
disputed
hung
his
head
a
little
and
went
on
unharnessing
his
corporal
in
silence
contenting
himself
with
muttering
in
his
throat
that
it
was
true
for
all
that
and
the
whole
regiment
knew
it
you
are
happy
enough
in
algeria
asked
the
one
he
served
as
he
stretched
himself
on
the
skins
and
carpets
and
drank
down
a
sherbet
that
his
attendant
had
made
with
a
skill
learned
from
a
pretty
cantiniere
who
had
given
him
the

a
slashing
blow
with
which
he
had
struck
down
two
who
as
the
best
paid
men
in
the
army
had
tried
to
cheat

in

i
sir
never
was
so
happy
in
my
life
sir
i
be
discontented
indeed
if
i
was
always
some
spicy
bit
of
fighting
if
there
are
a
fantasia
as
they
call
it
in
the
field
there
always
somebody
to
pot
in
a
small
way
and
if
you
lying
by
in
barracks
there
always
a
scrimmage
hot
as
pepper
to
be
got
up
with
fellows
that
love
the
row
just
as
well
as
you
do
it
life
that
where
it
is
it
ai
then
you
prefer
the
french
service
right
and
away
sir
you
see
this
is
how
it
is
and
the
redoubtable
paused
in
the
vigorous
cleansing
and
brushing
he
was
bestowing
on
his
corporal
uniform
and
stood
at
ease
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
with
his
eloquence
no
way
impeded
by
the
that
was
always
between
his
teeth
over
there
in
england
you
know
sir
is
the
you
always
got
to
have
the
stock
on
and
look
as
stiff
as
a
stake
or
it
all
up
with
you
you
that
tormented
about
little
things
that
you
get
riled
and
kick
the
traces
before
the
great
come
to
try
you
there
a
lot
of
lads
would
be
game
as
game
could
be
in
battle
aye
and
good
lads
to
boot
doing
their
duty
right
as
a
trivet
when
it
came
to
anything
like
war
that
are
clean
drove
out
of
the
service
in
time
o
peace
along
with
all
them
petty
persecutions
that
worry
a
man
skin
like
now
here
they
know
that
and
lord
what
soldiers
they
do
make
through
knowing
of
it
it
tight
enough
and
stern
enough
in
big
things
martial
law
sharp
enough
and
obedience
to
the
letter
all
through
the
campaigning
but
that
do
grate
on
a
fellow
if
he
worth
his
salt
he
sure
to
understand
that
he
must
move
like
clockwork
in
a
fight
and
that
he
to
go
to
hell
at
and
mute
as
a
mouse
if
his
officers
see
fit
to
send
him
there
ai
better
stuff
to
make
soldiers
out
of
nowhere
than
englishmen
god
bless
but
badgered
they
horribly
badgered
and
that
why
the
service
take
over
there
let
alone
the
way
the
country
grudge
every
bit
of
pay
in
england
you
go
in
the
ranks
well
they
all
just
tell
you
a
blackguard
and
there
the
lash
and
you
better
behave
yourself
or
you
get
it
hot
and
hot
they
take
for
granted
you
a
bad
lot
or
you
would
be
there
and
in
course
you
riled
and
go
to
the
bad
according
seeing
that
it
what
expected
of
you
here
contrariwise
you
come
in
the
ranks
and
get
a
welcome
and
feel
that
it
just
rests
with
yourself
whether
you
wo
be
a
fine
fellow
or
not
and
just
along
of
feeling
that
you
pricked
to
show
the
best
metal
you
made
on
and
not
to
let
nobody
else
beat
you
out
of
the
race
like
ah
it
makes
a
wonderful
difference
to
a
fellow
a
wonderful
difference
whether
the
service
he
come
into
look
at
him
as
a
scamp
that
never
will
be
nothing
but
a
scamp
or
as
a
rascal
that
maybe
got
in
him
all
rascal
though
he
is
the
pluck
to
turn
into
a
hero
and
that
just
the
difference
sir
that
france
has
found
out
and
england
has
god
bless
her
all
the
same
with
which
the
soldier
whom
england
had
turned
adrift
and
france
had
won
in
her
stead
concluded
his
long
oration
by
dropping
on
his
knees
to
refill
his
corporal
pipe
an
army
just
a
machine
sir
in
course
he
concluded
as
he
rammed
in
the
turkish
tobacco
but
then
it
a
live
machine
for
all
that
and
each
little
bit
of
it
feels
for
itself
like
the
joints
in
an
body
now
if
only
one
of
them
little
bits
smarts
the
whole
creature
goes
wrong
there
the
listened
thoughtfully
to
his
comrade
where
he
lay
flung
on
the
skins
i
dare
say
you
are
right
enough
i
knew
nothing
of
my
men
when
when
i
was
in
england
we
none
of
us
did
but
i
can
very
well
believe
what
you
say
yet
fine
fellows
though
they
are
here
they
are
terrible
blackguards
in
course
they
are
sir
they
would
be
such
larky
company
unless
they
was
but
what
i
say
is
that
they
scamps
who
told
they
may
be
great
men
if
they
like
not
scamps
who
told
that
because
once
gone
to
the
devil
they
must
always
keep
there
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
yes
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
life
whether
hope
is
left
or
left
out
the
words
were
murmured
with
a
half
smile
that
had
a
dash
of
infinite
sadness
in
it
the
other
looked
at
him
quickly
with
a
shadow
of
keen
pain
passing
over
the
bright
frank
laughing
features
of
his
sunburned
face
he
knew
that
the
brief
words
held
the
whole
history
of
a
life
wo
there
never
be
no
hope
sir
he
whispered
while
his
voice
trembled
a
little
under
the
long
fierce
sweep
of
his
yellow
mustaches
the
chasseur
rallied
himself
with
a
slight
careless
laugh
the
laugh
with
which
he
had
met
before
now
the
onslaught
of
charges
ferocious
as
those
of
the
magnificent
day
of
mazagran
whom
for
both
of
us
oh
yes
very
likely
we
shall
achieve
fame
and
die
a
splendid
no
sir
said
the
other
with
the
hesitation
still
in
the
quiver
of
his
voice
you
know
i
meant
no
hope
of
your
ever
being
again
he
stopped
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
phrase
the
thoughts
he
was
thinking
the
other
moved
with
a
certain
impatience
how
often
must
i
tell
you
to
forget
that
i
was
ever
anything
except
a
soldier
of
france
forget
as
i
have
forgotten
it
the
audacious
irrepressible
whom
nothing
could
daunt
and
nothing
could
awe
looked
penitent
and
ashamed
as
a
chidden
spaniel
i
know
sir
i
have
tried
many
a
year
but
i
thought
perhaps
as
how
his
lordship
death
no
life
and
no
death
can
make
any
difference
to
me
except
the
death
that
some
day
an
arbico
lunge
will
give
me
and
that
is
a
long
time
ah
for
god
sake
cecil
do
talk
like
this
the
chasseur
gave
a
short
sharp
shiver
and
started
at
this
name
as
if
a
bullet
had
struck
him
never
say
that
again
rake
stammered
a
contrite
apology
i
never
have
done
sir
not
for
never
a
year
but
it
wrung
it
out
of
me
like
you
talking
of
wanting
death
in
that
way
oh
i
do
want
death
laughed
the
other
with
a
low
indifferent
laughter
that
had
in
it
a
singular
tone
of
sadness
all
the
while
i
am
of
our
friends
the
spahis
opinion
that
life
is
very
pleasant
with
a
handsome
harem
and
a
good
horse
to
one
saddle
unhappily
harems
are
too
expensive
for
roumis
yet
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
not
better
amused
in
the
chasseurs
than
i
was
in
the
household
specially
when
we
are
at
war
i
suppose
we
must
be
wild
animals
at
the
core
or
we
should
never
find
such
an
infinite
zest
in
the
death
grapple
he
stretched
his
long
slender
symmetrical
limbs
out
on
the
skins
that
made
his
bed
and
closed
his
eyes
with
the
pipe
still
in
his
mouth
and
its
amber
bowl
resting
on
the
carpet
which
the
friendship
and
honor
of
had
strewn
over
the
bare
turf
on
which
the
house
of
hair
was
raised
he
was
accustomed
to
sleep
as
soldiers
sleep
in
all
the
din
of
a
camp
or
with
the
roar
of
savage
brutes
echoing
from
the
hills
around
with
his
saddle
beneath
his
head
under
a
slab
of
rock
or
with
the
knowledge
that
at
every
instant
the
alarm
might
be
given
the
drums
roll
out
over
the
night
and
the
enemy
be
down
like
lightning
on
the
bivouac
but
now
a
name
long
unspoken
to
him
had
recalled
years
he
had
buried
far
and
forever
from
the
first
day
that
he
had
worn
the
kepi
of
the
army
of
algeria
and
been
enrolled
among
its
wild
and
brilliant
soldiers
now
long
after
his
comrade
had
slept
soundly
and
the
light
in
the
single
bronze
turkish
had
flickered
and
died
away
the
chasseur
lay
wakeful
looking
outward
through
the
folds
of
the
tent
at
the
dark
and
silent
camp
of
the
arabs
and
letting
his
memory
drift
backward
to
a
time
that
had
grown
to
be
to
him
as
a
dream
a
time
when
another
world
than
the
world
of
africa
had
known
him
as

on

shining
through

the

a

who
was
the
most
terrible
martinet
in
the
whole
of
the
french
service

who
loved
my
children

as
he
was

to

his

a

in

the

the
colonel
of
tirailleurs
lifted
his

a
slight
pale
effeminate
parisian
who
looked
scarcely
stronger
than
a
flower
yet
who
as
many
an
african
chronicle
could
tell
was
swift
as

keen
as

unerring
as

and
he
drained
his

thoughtfully
musing
on
the

of

and
on
the
patrician
blood
the
wasted
wit
the
beaumarchais

the
mirabeau
power
the
adventures
like
a
page
of
fairy

the
brains
whose
strength
could
have
guided

hidden
under
the
rough
uniform
of
a
zephyr
buried
beneath
the
canvas
shirt
of
a
roumi
lost
forever
in
the
wild
lawless
escapades
of
rebellious
insubordinates
who
closed
their
days
in
the
stifling
darkness
of
the
dungeons
of
beylick
or
in
some
obscure
skirmish
some
midnight
vedette
where
an
arab
flissa
severed
the

of

warped

was
unhonored

chanrellon
regardless
of

if

the
the

as

voices
closed

mischiefs

the

and

sure
enough
but
the
general
named
the
worst
look
at
that
little
cora
the
minister

should
give
her
the
cross
she
sends
us
ten
times
more
than
the

does
five
fine
fellows
of
the
vieille

too
joined
because
she
has
stripped
them
of
everything
and
they
have
nothing
for
it
but
the
service
she
is
invaluable
and
there
is
not
much
to
look
at
in
her
either
objected
a
captain
who
commanded
turcos
i
saw
her
when
our
detachment
went
to
show
in
paris
a
baby
face
innocent
as
a
cherub
a
soft
voice
a
shape
that
looks
as
slight
and
as
breakable
as
the
stem
of
my
glass
there
is
the
end
the
colonel
of
tirailleurs
laughed
scornfully
but
gently
he
had
been
a
great
lion
of
the
fashionable
world
before
he
came
out
to
his
indigenes
the
end
of
cora
the
end
of
her
is
my
good
alcide
that
has
ruined
more
of
us
than
would
make
up
a
battalion
she
is
so
quiet
so
tender
smiles
like
an
angel
glides
like
a
fawn
is
a
little
sad
too
the
innocent
dove
looks
at
you
with
eyes
as
clear
as
water
and
paf
before
you
know
where
you
are
she
has
pillaged
with
both
hands
and
you
wake
one
fine
morning
bankrupt
why
do
you
let
her
do
it
growled
the
vieille
moustache
who
had
served
under
junot
when
a
little
lad
and
had
scant
knowledge
of
the
ways
and
wiles
of
the
sirens
of
the
rue
breda
ah
bah
said
the
colonel
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
it
is
the
thing
to
be
ruined
by
claude
de
chanrellon
sighed
stretching
his
handsome
limbs
with
the
sigh
of
recollection
for
paris
had
been
a
paradise
lost
to
him
for
many
seasons
and
he
had
had
of
late
years
but
one
solitary
glimpse
of
it
it
was
coeur
who
was
the
rage
in
my
time
she
ate
me
up
that
woman
in
three
months
i
had
not
a
hundred
francs
left
she
stripped
me
as
bare
as
a
pigeon
her
passion
was
uncut
emeralds
just
then
well
uncut
emeralds
made
an
end
of
me
and
sent
me
out
here
coeur
was
a
wonderful
woman
and
the
chief
wonder
of
her
was
that
she
was
as
ugly
as
ugly
ugly
as
sin
but
she
had
the
knack
of
making
herself
more
charming
than
venus
how
she
did
it
nobody
knew
but
men
left
the
prettiest
creatures
for
her
and
she
ruined
us
i
think
at
the
rate
of
a
score
a
like
loto
chimed
in
the
tirailleur
loto
has
not
a
shred
of
beauty
she
is
a
big
angular
normande
with
a
rough
voice
and
a
villainous
patois
but
to
be
well
with
loto
is
to
have
achieved
distinction
at
once
she
will
have
nothing
under
the

listening
ah
you
fell
too
among
the
lotos
and
the
coeurs
once
i
will
the
chasseur
who
was
passing
paused
and
smiled
a
little
as
he
saluted
coeurs

to
be
found
in
all
ranks
of
the

monsieur
i
fancy
bah
you
beg
the
question
did
not
a
woman
send
you
out
here
no
monsieur
only
a
fig
for
your
chance
women
are
the
mischief
that
casts
us
adrift
to
monsieur
we
cast
ourselves
dieu
de
dieu
i
doubt
that
we
should
go
straight
enough
if
it
were
not
for
the
chasseur
smiled
again
m
le
viscomte
thinks
we
are
sure
to
be
right
then
if
for
the
key
to
every
black
story
we
ask
was
she
of
course
i
do
well
who
was
she
we
are
all
quoting
our
tempters
give
us
your
story
mon
brave
monsieur
you
have
it
in
the
folios
as
well
as
my
sword
could
write
good
good
muttered
the
listening
general
the
answer
pleased
him
and
he
looked
attentively
at
the
giver
of
it
chanrellon
brown
eyes
flashed
a
bright
response
and
your
sword
writes
in
a
brave
man
fashion
writes
what
france
loves
to
read
but
before
you
wore
your
sword
here
tell
us
of
that
it
was
a
romance
was
it
if
it
were
i
have
folded
down
the
page
open
it
then
come
what
brought
you
out
among
us
out
with
it
monsieur
direct
obedience
is
a
soldier
duty
but
i
never
heard
that
inquisitive
annoyance
was
an
officer
these
words
were
calm
cold
a
little
languid
and
a
little
haughty
the
manner
of
old
habit
the
instinct
of
buried
pride
spoke
in
them
and
disregarded
the
barrier
between
a
private
of
chasseurs
who
was
but
a
and
a
colonel
commandant
who
was
also
a
noble
of
france
involuntarily
all
the
men
sitting
round
the
little
table
outside
the
cafe
turned
and
looked
at
him
the
boldness
of
speech
and
the
quietude
of
tone
drew
all
their
eyes
in
curiosity
upon
him
chanrellon
flushed
scarlet
over
his
frank
brow
and
an
instant
passion
gleamed
out
of
his
eyes
the
next
he
threw
his
three
chairs
down
with
a
crash
as
he
shook
his
mighty
frame
like
an
alpine
dog
and
bowed
with
a
french
grace
with
a
campaigner
frankness
a
right
rebuke
fairly
given
and
well
deserved
i
thank
you
for
the
the
chasseur
looked
surprised
and
moved
in
truth
he
was
more
touched
than
he
showed
under
the
rule
of
chateauroy
consideration
and
courtesy
had
been
things
long
unshown
to
him
involuntarily
forgetful
of
rank
he
stretched
his
hand
out
on
the
impulse
of
soldier
to
soldier
of
gentleman
to
gentleman
then
as
the
bitter
remembrance
of
the
difference
in
rank
and
station
between
them
flashed
on
his
memory
he
was
raising
it
proudly
deferentially
in
the
salute
of
a
subordinate
to
his
superior
when
chanrellon
grasp
closed
on
it
readily
the
victim
of
coeur
was
of
as
gallant
a
temper
as
ever
blent
the
reckless
condottiere
with
the
thoroughbred
noble
the
chasseur
colored
slightly
as
he
remembered
that
he
had
forgotten
alike
his
own
position
and
their
relative
stations
i
beg
your
pardon
le
viscomte
he
said
simply
as
he
gave
the
salute
with
ceremonious
grace
and
passed
onward
rapidly
as
though
he
wished
to
forget
and
to
have
forgotten
the
momentary
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
dieu
muttered
chanrellon
as
he
looked
after
him
and
struck
his
hand
on
the
table
till
the
glasses
shook
i
would
give
a
year
pay
to
know
that
fine
fellow
history
he
is
a
gentleman
every
inch
of
and
a
good
soldier
which
is
better
growled
the
general
of
brigade
who
had
begun
life
in
his
time
driving
an
over
the
heavy
tillage
of
alsace
a
private
of
chateauroy
asked
the
tirailleur
lifting
his
to
watch
the
chasseur
as
he
went
pardieu
yes
more
the
pity
said
chanrellon
who
spoke
his
thoughts
as
hastily
as
a
scatters
its
powder
the
black
hawk
hates
him
god
knows
why
and
he
is
kept
down
in
consequence
as
if
he
were
the
idlest
lout
or
the
most
incorrigible
rebel
in
the
service
look
at
what
he
has
done
all
the
bureaux
will
tell
you
there
is
not
a
finer
roumi
in
africa
not
even
among
our
schaouacks
since
he
joined
there
has
not
been
a
hot
and
heavy
thing
with
the
arabs
that
he
has
not
had
his
share
in
there
has
not
been
a
campaign
in
oran
or
kabaila
that
he
had
not
gone
out
with
his
limbs
are
slashed
all
over
with
bedouin
steel
he
rode
once
twenty
leagues
to
deliver
dispatches
with
a
in
his
side
and
fell
in
a
dead
faint
out
of
his
saddle
just
as
he
gave
them
up
to
the
commandant
own
hands
he
saved
the
day
two
years
ago
at
granaila
we
should
have
been
cut
to
pieces
as
sure
as
destiny
if
he
had
not
collected
a
handful
of
broken
chasseurs
together
and
rallied
them
and
rated
them
and
lashed
them
with
their
shame
till
they
dashed
with
him
to
a
man
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
and
pierced
the
arabs
center
and
gave
us
breathing
room
till
we
all
charged
together
and
beat
the
arbicos
back
like
a
herd
of
jackals
there
are
a
hundred
more
like
stories
of
him
every
one
of
them
true
as
my
saber
and
in
reward
he
has
just
been
made
a
galonne
superb
said
the
general
with
a
grim
significance
twelve
years
in
five
under
napoleon
he
would
have
been
at
the
head
of
a
brigade
but
then
and
the
veteran
drank
his
absinthe
with
a
regretful
melancholy
but
then
napoleon
read
his
men
himself
and
never
read
them
wrong
it
is
a
divine
gift
that
for
the
black
hawk
can
read
too
said
chanrellon
meditatively
but
it
was
the
petit
nom
that
chateauroy
had
gained
long
before
and
by
which
he
was
best
known
through
the
army
no
eyes
are
keener
than
his
to
trace
a
lascar
kebir
but
where
he
hates
he
strikes
beak
and
talons
pong
till
the
thing
drops
dead
even
where
he
strikes
a
bird
of
his
own
that
is
bad
said
the
old
general
sententiously
there
are
four
people
who
should
have
no
personal
likes
or
dislikes
they
are
an
innkeeper
a
schoolmaster
a
ship
skipper
and
a
military
with
which
axiom
he
called
for
some
more
meanwhile
the
chasseur
went
his
way
through
the
cosmopolitan
groups
of
the
great
square
a
little
farther
onward
laughing
smoking
chatting
eating
ices
outside
a
cafe
chantant
were
a
group
of
englishmen
a
yachting
party
whose
schooner
lay
in
the
harbor
he
lingered
a
moment
and
lighted
a
fusee
just
for
the
sake
of
hearing
the
old
familiar
words
as
he
bent
his
head
no
one
saw
the
shadow
of
pain
that
passed
over
his
face
but
one
of
them
looked
at
him
curiously
and
earnestly
the
deuce
he
murmured
to
the
man
nearest
him
who
the
dickens
is
it
that
french
soldier
like
the
french
soldier
heard
and
with
the
cigar
in
his
teeth
moved
away
quickly
he
was
uneasy
in
the
city
uneasy
lest
he
should
be
recognized
by
any
or
tourist
i
need
not
fear
that
though
he
thought
with
a
smile
ten
years
why
in
that
world
we
used
to
forget
the
blackest
ruin
in
ten
days
and
the
best
life
among
us
ten
hours
after
its
grave
was
closed
besides
i
am
safe
enough
i
am
dead
and
he
pursued
his
onward
way
with
the
red
glow
of
the
cigar
under
the
chestnut
splendor
of
his
beard
and
the
black
eyes
of
veiled
women
flashed
lovingly
on
his
tall
lithe
form
with
the
scarlet
undress
fez
set
on
his
forehead
fair
as
a
woman
still
despite
the
tawny
glow
of
the
african
sun
that
had
been
on
it
for
so
long
he
was
dead
therein
had
lain
all
his
security
thereby
had
beauty
of
the
brigades
been
buried
beyond
all
discovery
in
of
the
chasseurs
when
on
the
marseilles
rails
the
maceration
and
slaughter
of
as
terrible
an
accident
as
ever
befell
a
train
rushing
through
the
midnight
darkness
at
headlong
speed
had
left
himself
and
the
one
man
faithful
to
his
fortunes
unharmed
by
little
less
than
a
miracle
he
had
seen
in
the
calamity
the
surest
screen
from
discovery
or
pursuit
leaving
the
baggage
where
it
was
jammed
among
the
debris
he
had
struck
across
the
country
with
rake
for
the
few
leagues
that
still
lay
between
them
and
the
city
and
had
entered
marseilles
as
weary
foot
travelers
before
half
the
ruin
on
the
rails
had
been
seen
by
the
full
noon
sun
as
it
chanced
a
trading
yawl
was
loading
in
the
port
to
run
across
to
algiers
that
very
day
the
skipper
was
short
of
men
and
afraid
of
the
lascars
who
were
the
only
sailors
that
he
seemed
likely
to
find
to
fill
up
the
vacant
places
in
his
small
crew
cecil
offered
himself
and
his
comrade
for
the
passage
he
had
only
a
very
few
gold
pieces
on
his
person
and
he
was
willing
to
work
his
way
across
if
he
could
but
you
a
gentleman
said
the
skipper
doubtfully
eyeing
him
and
his
velvet
dress
and
his
black
sombrero
with
its
eagle
plume
i
want
a
rare
rough
able
seaman
for
there
like
to
be
foul
weather
she
looks
too
fair
to
last
he
concluded
with
a
glance
upward
at
the
sky
he
was
a
liverpool
man
master
and
owner
of
his
own
little
craft
that
rumor
was
wont
to
say
was
not
averse
to
a
bit
of
slaving
if
she
found
herself
in
far
seas
with
a
likely
run
before
her
you
a
swell
that
what
you
are
emphasized
the
skipper
you
bea
no
sort
of
use
to
wait
a
second
answered
cecil
did
you
ever
chance
to
hear
of
a
schooner
called
the
skipper
face
lighted
in
a
moment
her
as
was
in
the
biscay
july
come
two
years
her
as
drove
through
the
storm
like
a
mad
thing
and
flew
like
a
swallow
when
everything
was
splitting
and
foundering
and
shipping
seas
around
her
her
as
was
the
first
to
bear
down
to
the
great
there
hull
over
in
water
and
took
aboard
all
as
ever
she
could
hold
o
the
passengers
out
her
own
beautiful
cabin
fittings
to
have
as
much
room
for
the
poor
wretches
as
ever
she
could
be
you
her
cecil
nodded
assent
she
was
my
yacht
that
all
and
i
was
without
a
captain
through
that
storm
will
you
think
me
a
good
enough
sailor
now
the
skipper
wrung
his
hand
till
he
nearly
wrung
it
off
good
enough
blast
my
timbers
there
are
one
will
beat
you
in
any
waters
come
on
sir
if
so
be
as
you
wishes
it
but
never
a
stroke
of
work
shall
you
do
atween
my
decks
i
never
did
think
as
how
one
of
your
could
ever
be
fit
to
lay
hold
of
a
tiller
but
hang
me
if
the
club
make
such
sailors
as
you
it
a
rare
lord
a
mercy
why
my
wife
was
in
the
i
heard
her
tell
scores
of
times
as
how
she
was
almost
dead
when
that
little
yacht
came
through
a
swaling
sea
that
was
all
heaving
and
roaring
round
the
wreck
and
as
how
the
swell
what
owned
it
gave
his
cabin
up
to
the
womenkind
and
had
his
swivel
guns
and
his
handsome
furniture
pitched
overboard
that
he
might
be
able
to
carry
more
passengers
and
fed
and
gave
champagne
all
around
and
treated
like
a
prince
till
he
ran
straight
into
brest
harbor
but
damn
me
that
ever
a
swell
like
you
should
let
weigh
anchor
said
bertie
quietly
and
so
he
crossed
unnoticed
to
algeria
while
through
europe
the
tidings
went
that
the
mutilated
form
crushed
between
iron
and
wood
on
the
marseilles
line
was
his
and
that
he
had
perished
in
that
awful
sultry
southern
night
when
the
rushing
trains
had
met
as
meet
the
the
world
thought
him
dead
as
such
the
journals
recorded
him
with
the
shameful
outlines
of
imputed
crime
to
make
the
death
the
darker
as
such
his
name
was
forbidden
to
be
uttered
at
royallieu
as
such
the
seraph
mourned
him
with
passionate
loving
force
refusing
to
the
last
to
accredit
his
guilt
and
he
leaving
them
in
their
error
was
drafted
into
the
french
army
under
two
of
his
christian
names
which
happily
had
a
foreign
sound
louis
victor
and
laid
aside
forever
his
identity
as
bertie
cecil
he
went
at
once
on
service
in
the
interior
and
had
scarcely
come
in
any
of
the
larger
towns
since
he
had
joined
his
only
danger
of
recognition
had
been
once
when
a
marshal
of
france
whom
he
had
used
to
know
well
in
paris
and
at
the
court
of
james
held
an
inspection
of
the
african
troops
filing
past
the
brilliant
staff
he
had
ridden
at
only
a
few
distance
from
his
old
acquaintance
and
as
he
saluted
had
glanced
involuntarily
at
the
face
that
he
had
seen
oftentimes
in
the
salles
de
marechaux
and
even
under
the
roof
of
the
regiment
ready
to
note
a
chain
loose
a
belt
awry
a
sword
specked
with
rust
if
such
a
sin
there
were
against
les
ordonnances
in
all
the
glittering
squadrons
and
swept
over
him
seeing
in
him
but
one
among
thousands
a
unit
in
the
mighty
aggregate
of
the
raw
material
of
war
the
marshal
only
muttered
to
a
general
beside
him
why
do
they
all
ride
like
that
man
he
has
the
seat
of
the
english
but
that
it
was
in
truth
an
officer
of
the
english
guards
and
a
friend
of
his
own
who
paced
past
him
as
a
private
of
algerian
horse
the
french
leader
never
dreamed
from
the
extremes
of
luxury
indolence
indulgence
pleasure
and
extravagance
cecil
came
to
the
extremes
of
hardship
poverty
discipline
suffering
and
toil
from
a
life
where
every
sense
was
gratified
he
came
to
a
life
where
every
privation
was
endured
he
had
led
the
fashion
he
came
where
he
had
to
bear
without
a
word
the
curses
oaths
and
insults
of
a
corporal
or
a
he
had
been
used
to
every
delicacy
and
delight
he
came
where
he
had
to
take
the
coarse
black
bread
of
the
army
as
a
rich
repast
he
had
thought
it
too
much
trouble
to
murmur
flatteries
in
great
ladies
ears
he
came
where
morning
noon
and
night
the
inexorable
demands
of
rigid
rules
compelled
his
incessant
obedience
vigilance
activity
and
he
had
known
nothing
from
his
childhood
up
except
an
atmosphere
of
amusement
refinement
brilliancy
and
idleness
he
came
where
gnawing
hunger
brutalized
jest
ceaseless
toil
coarse
obscenity
agonized
pain
and
pandemonaic
mirth
alternately
filled
the
measure
of
the
days
a
sharper
contrast
a
darker
ordeal
rarely
tried
the
steel
of
any
endurance
no
spartan
could
have
borne
the
change
more
mutely
more
staunchly
than
did
the
dandy
of
the
the
first
years
were
it
is
true
years
of
intense
misery
to
him
misery
when
all
the
blood
glowed
in
him
under
some
petty
tyrant
jibe
and
he
had
to
stand
immovable
holding
his
peace
misery
when
hunger
and
thirst
of
long
marches
tortured
him
and
his
soul
sickened
at
the
offal
and
the
water
thick
with
dust
and
stained
with
blood
which
the
men
round
him
seized
so
ravenously
misery
when
the
dreary
dawn
broke
only
to
usher
in
a
day
of
mechanical
maneuvers
of
petty
tyrannies
of
barren
burdensome
hours
in
the
of
convoy
duty
in
the
burning
and
under
the
heat
of
harness
and
the
weary
night
fell
with
the
din
and
uproar
and
the
villainous
blasphemy
and
befouled
merriment
of
the
riotous
barracks
that
denied
even
the
peace
and
oblivion
of
sleep
they
were
years
of
infinite
wretchedness
oftentimes
only
relieved
by
the
loyalty
and
devotion
of
the
man
who
had
followed
him
into
his
exile
but
however
wretched
they
never
wrung
a
single
regret
or
lament
from
cecil
he
had
come
out
to
this
life
he
took
it
as
it
was
as
having
lost
the
title
to
command
the
high
breeding
in
him
made
him
render
implicitly
the
mute
obedience
which
was
the
first
duty
of
his
present
position
so
it
made
him
accept
from
first
to
last
without
a
sign
of
complaint
or
of
impatience
the
altered
fortunes
of
his
career
the
soldier
in
the
zephyr
ranks
did
not
bear
himself
with
more
apparent
content
and
more
absolute
fortitude
than
did
the
man
who
had
used
to
think
it
a
cruelty
to
ride
with
his
troop
from
windsor
to
wormwood
scrubs
and
had
never
taken
the
trouble
to
load
his
own
gun
any
shooting
season
or
to
draw
off
his
own
coat
any
evening
he
suffered
acutely
many
times
suffered
till
he
was
of
his
life
but
he
never
sought
to
escape
the
slightest
penalty
or
hardship
and
not
even
rake
ever
heard
from
him
a
single
syllable
of
irritation
or
of
moreover
the
woke
in
him
in
one
shape
or
another
active
service
was
almost
always
his
lot
and
hot
severe
campaigning
was
his
first
introduction
to
military
life
in
algeria
the
latent
instinct
in
him
the
instinct
that
had
flashed
out
during
his
lazy
fashionable
calm
in
all
moments
of
danger
in
all
days
of
keen
sport
the
instinct
that
had
made
him
fling
himself
into
the
duello
with
the
french
boar
and
made
him
mutter
to
forest
king
kill
me
if
you
like
but
do
fail
me
was
the
instinct
of
the
born
soldier
in
peril
in
battle
in
reckless
bravery
in
the
rush
of
the
charge
and
the
excitement
of
the
surprise
in
the
near
presence
of
death
and
in
the
chase
of
a
foe
through
a
hot
african
night
when
both
were
armed
to
the
teeth
and
one
or
both
must
fall
when
the
grapple
came
in
all
these
that
old
instinct
aroused
and
unloosed
made
him
content
made
him
think
that
the
life
which
brought
them
was
worth
the
living
there
had
always
been
in
him
a
reckless
which
had
slept
under
the
serene
effeminate
insouciance
of
his
careless
temper
and
his
pampered
habits
it
had
full
rein
now
and
made
him
as
the
army
affirmed
one
of
the
most
intrepid
victorious
and
chivalrous
lascars
of
its
fiery
ranks
fate
had
flung
him
off
his
couch
of
down
into
the
tempest
of
war
into
the
sternness
of
life
spent
ever
on
the
border
of
the
grave
ruled
over
by
an
iron
code
requiring
at
every
step
fortitude
submission
courage
patience
the
which
should
take
the
uttermost
provocation
from
those
in
command
without
even
a
look
of
reprisal
and
the
courageous
recklessness
which
should
meet
death
and
deal
death
which
should
be
as
the
eagle
to
swoop
as
the
lion
to
rend
and
he
was
not
found
wanting
in
it
he
was
too
thoroughbred
to
attempt
to
claim
a
superiority
that
fortune
no
longer
conferred
on
him
to
seek
to
obtain
a
deference
that
he
had
no
longer
the
position
to
demand
he
was
too
quiet
too
courteous
too
calmly
listless
he
had
too
easy
a
grace
too
soft
a
voice
and
too
many
gentleman
habits
for
them
but
when
they
found
that
he
could
fight
like
a
zouave
ride
like
an
arab
and
bear
or
as
though
he
were
of
bronze
it
grew
a
delight
to
them
to
see
of
what
granite
and
steel
this
dainty
patrician
was
made
and
they
loved
him
with
a
rough
ardent
love
when
they
found
that
his
last
crust
in
a
long
march
would
always
be
divided
that
the
most
desperate
service
of
danger
was
always
volunteered
for
by
him
that
no
severity
of
personal
chastisement
ever
made
him
clear
himself
of
a
false
charge
at
a
comrade
expense
and
that
all
his
pay
went
in
giving
a
veteran
a
stoup
of
wine
or
a
sick
conscript
a
tempting
meal
or
a
prisoner
of
beylick
some
food
through
the
grating
scaled
too
at
risk
of
life
and
limb
he
had
never
before
been
called
on
to
exert
either
thought
or
action
the
necessity
for
both
called
many
latent
qualities
in
him
into
play
the
same
nature
which
had
made
him
wish
to
be
killed
over
the
grand
military
course
rather
than
live
to
lose
the
race
made
him
now
bear
privation
as
calmly
and
risk
death
as
recklessly
as
the
heartiest
and
most
fiery
loustic
of
the
african
regiments
on
the
surface
it
seemed
as
though
never
was
there
a
life
more
utterly
thrown
away
than
the
life
of
a
guardsman
and
a
gentleman
a
man
of
good
blood
high
rank
and
talented
gifts
had
he
ever
chosen
to
make
anything
of
them
buried
in
the
ranks
of
the
army
risking
a
nameless
grave
in
the
sand
with
almost
every
hour
associated
with
the
roughest
riffraff
of
europe
liable
any
day
to
be
slain
by
the
slash
of
an
arab
flissa
and
rewarded
for
ten
years
splendid
service
by
the
distinctive
badge
of
a
corporal
yet
it
might
be
doubted
if
any
life
would
have
done
for
him
what
this
had
done
it
might
be
questioned
if
judging
a
career
not
by
its
social
position
but
by
its
effect
on
character
any
other
would
have
been
so
well
for
him
or
would
equally
have
given
steel
and
strength
to
the
indolence
and
languor
of
his
nature
as
this
did
in
his
old
world
he
would
have
lounged
listlessly
through
fashionable
seasons
and
in
an
atmosphere
that
encouraged
his
profound
negligence
of
everything
and
his
natural
listlessness
would
have
glided
from
refinement
to
effeminacy
and
from
lazy
grace
to
blase
inertia
the
severity
and
the
dangers
of
the
campaigns
with
the
french
army
had
roused
the
sleeping
lion
in
him
and
made
him
as
fine
a
soldier
as
ever
ranged
under
any
flag
he
had
suffered
braved
resented
fought
loved
hated
endured
and
even
enjoyed
here
in
africa
with
a
force
and
a
vividness
that
he
had
never
dreamed
possible
in
his
calm
passionless
insouciant
world
of
other
days
it
developed
him
into
a
magnificent
soldier
too
true
a
soldier
not
to
make
thoroughly
his
the
service
he
had
adopted
not
to
oftentimes
almost
forget
that
he
had
ever
lived
under
any
other
flag
than
that
tricolor
which
he
followed
and
defended
now
the
quaint
heroic
norman
motto
of
his
ancestors
carved
over
the
gates
of
royallieu
coeur
vaillant
se
fait
royaume
verified
itself
in
his
case
outlawed
beggared
robbed
at
a
stroke
of
every
hope
and
prospect
he
had
taken
his
adversity
boldly
by
the
beard
and
had
made
himself
at
once
a
country
and
a
kingdom
among
the
brave
fierce
reckless
loyal
hearts
of
the
men
who
came
from
north
south
east
and
west
driven
by
every
accident
and
scourged
by
every
fate
to
fill
up
the
battalions
of
north
africa
as
he
went
now
in
the
warmth
of
the
he
turned
up
into
the
rue
babazoum
and
paused
before
the
entrance
of
a
narrow
dark
picturesque
shop
half
like
a
stall
of
a
cairo
bazaar
half
like
a
jew
den
in
a
florentine
alley
a
cunning
wizen
head
peered
out
at
him
from
the
gloom
ah
ha
corporal
victor
cecil
at
the
words
crossed
the
sill
and
entered
have
you
sold
any
he
asked
there
was
a
slight
constraint
and
hesitation
in
the
words
as
of
one
who
can
never
fairly
bend
his
spirit
to
the
yoke
of
barter
the
little
hideous
wrinkled
creature
a
trader
in
curiosities
grinned
with
a
certain
gratification
in
disappointing
this
handsome
chasseur
not
one
the
toys
do
take
daggers
now
or
anything
made
out
of
spent
balls
or
flissas
one
can
tell
an
arab
story
about
go
off
like
but
your
ivory
bagatelles
are
no
sort
of
use
le
very
well
no
matter
said
cecil
simply
as
he
paused
a
moment
before
some
delicate
little
statuettes
and
carvings
miniature
things
carved
out
of
a
piece
of
ivory
or
a
block
of
marble
the
size
of
a
hoof
such
as
could
be
picked
up
in
dry
river
channels
or
broken
off
stray
boulders
slender
crucifixes
wreathes
of
foliage
branches
of
wild
fig
figures
of
arabs
and
moors
dainty
heads
of
and
tiny
chargers
fretting
like
bucephalus
they
were
perfectly
conceived
and
executed
he
had
always
had
a
gift
that
way
though
in
common
with
all
his
gifts
he
had
utterly
neglected
all
culture
of
it
until
cast
adrift
on
the
world
and
forced
to
do
something
to
maintain
himself
he
had
watched
the
skill
of
the
french
soldiers
at
all
such
expedients
to
gain
a
few
coins
and
had
solaced
many
a
dreary
hour
in
barracks
and
under
canvas
with
the
till
he
had
attained
a
singular
art
at
it
he
had
commonly
given
rake
the
office
of
selling
them
and
as
commonly
spent
all
the
proceeds
on
all
other
needs
save
his
own
he
lingered
a
moment
with
regret
in
his
eyes
he
had
scarcely
a
sou
in
his
pocket
and
he
had
wanted
some
money
sorely
that
night
for
a
comrade
dying
of
a
a
noble
fellow
a
french
artist
who
in
an
evil
hour
of
desperation
had
joined
the
army
with
a
poet
temper
that
made
its
hard
colorless
routine
unendurable
and
had
been
shot
in
the
chest
in
a
you
will
not
buy
them
yourself
he
asked
at
length
the
color
flushing
in
his
face
he
would
not
have
pressed
the
question
to
save
his
own
life
from
starving
but
leon
ramon
would
have
no
chance
of
fruit
or
a
lump
of
ice
to
cool
his
parched
lips
and
still
his
agonized
retching
unless
he
himself
could
get
money
to
buy
those
luxuries
that
are
too
splendid
and
too
merciful
to
be
provided
for
a
dying
soldier
who
knows
so
little
of
his
duty
to
his
country
as
to
venture
to
die
in
his
bed
myself
screeched
the
dealer
with
a
derisive
laugh
ask
me
to
give
you
my
whole
stock
next
these
trumperies
will
lie
on
hand
for
a
cecil
went
out
of
the
place
without
a
word
his
thoughts
were
with
leon
ramon
and
the
insolence
scarce
touched
him
how
shall
i
get
him
the
ice
he
wondered
god
if
i
had
only
one
of
the
lumps
that
used
to
float
in
our
claret
cup
as
he
left
the
den
a
military
fairy
all
gay
with
blue
and
crimson
like
the
fuchsia
bell
she
most
resembled
with
a
meerschaum
in
her
scarlet
lips
and
a
world
of
wrath
in
her
bright
black
eyes
dashed
past
him
into
the
darkness
within
and
before
the
dealer
knew
or
dreamed
of
her
tossed
up
the
old
man
little
shriveled
frame
like
a
shuttlecock
shook
him
till
he
shook
like
custards
flung
him
upward
and
caught
him
as
if
he
were
the
hoop
in
a
game
of
la
grace
and
set
him
down
bruised
breathless
and
terrified
out
of
his
wits
ah
cried
cigarette
with
a
volley
of
slang
utterly
untranslatable
that
is
how
you
treat
your
betters
is
it
miser
monster
crocodile
serpent
he
wanted
the
money
and
you
refused
it
ah
son
of
satan
you
live
on
other
men
miseries
run
after
him
quick
and
give
him
this
and
this
and
this
and
this
and
say
you
were
only
in
jest
and
that
the
things
were
worth
a
sheik
ransom
stay
you
must
not
give
him
too
much
or
he
will
know
it
is
not
you
viper
run
quick
and
breath
a
word
about
me
if
you
dare
one
whisper
only
and
my
spahis
shall
cut
your
throat
from
ear
to
ear
off
or
you
shall
have
a
bullet
to
quicken
your
steps
misers
dance
well
when
pistols
play
the
minuet
with
which
exordium
the
little
amie
du
drapeau
shook
her
culprit
at
every
epithet
emptied
out
a
shower
of
gold
and
silver
just
won
at
play
from
the
bosom
of
her
uniform
forced
it
into
the
dealer
hands
hurled
him
out
of
his
own
door
and
drew
her
pretty
weapon
with
a
clash
from
her
sash
run
for
your
life
and
do
just
what
i
bid
you
or
a
shot
shall
crash
your
skull
in
as
sure
as
my
name
is
cigarette
the
little
old
jew
flew
as
fast
as
his
limbs
would
carry
him
clutching
the
coins
in
his
horny
hands
he
was
terrified
to
a
mortal
anguish
and
had
not
a
thought
of
resisting
or
disobeying
her
he
knew
the
fame
of
cigarette
as
who
did
not
knew
that
she
would
fire
at
a
man
as
carelessly
as
at
a
cat
more
carelessly
in
truth
for
she
favored
cats
saving
many
from
going
to
the
zouaves
and
favored
civilians
not
at
all
and
knew
that
at
her
rallying
cry
all
the
sabers
about
the
town
would
be
drawn
without
a
second
deliberation
and
sheathed
in
anything
or
anybody
that
had
offended
her
for
cigarette
was
in
her
fashion
generalissima
of
all
the
regiments
of
africa
the
dealer
ran
with
all
the
speed
of
terror
and
overtook
cecil
who
was
going
slowly
onward
to
the
barracks
are
you
serious
he
asked
in
surprise
at
the
large
amount
as
the
little
jew
panted
out
apologies
entreaties
and
protestations
of
his
only
having
been
in
jest
and
of
his
fervently
desiring
to
buy
the
carvings
at
his
own
price
as
he
knew
of
a
great
collector
in
paris
to
whom
he
needed
to
send
them
serious
indeed
am
i
serious
le
caporal
pleaded
the
turning
his
head
in
agonized
fear
to
see
if
the
vivandiere
pistol
was
behind
him
the
things
will
be
worth
a
great
deal
to
me
where
i
shall
send
them
and
though
they
are
but
bagatelles
what
is
paris
itself
but
one
bagatelle
pouf
they
are
all
children
there
they
will
love
the
toys
take
the
money
i
pray
you
take
the
money
cecil
looked
at
him
a
moment
he
saw
the
man
was
in
earnest
and
thought
but
little
of
his
repentance
and
trepidation
for
the
citizens
were
all
afraid
of
slighting
or
annoying
a
soldier
so
be
it
thank
you
he
said
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
the
coins
not
without
a
keen
pang
of
the
old
pride
that
would
not
be
wholly
stilled
yet
gladly
for
sake
of
the
chasseur
dying
yonder
growing
delirious
and
retching
the
blood
off
his
lungs
in
want
of
one
touch
of
the
ice
that
was
spoiled
by
the
ton
weight
to
keep
cool
the
wines
and
the
fish
of
le
marquis
de
chateauroy
and
he
went
onward
to
spend
the
gold
his
sculpture
had
brought
on
some
yellow
figs
and
some
cool
golden
grapes
and
some
wines
that
should
soothe
a
little
of
the
pangs
of
dissolution
to
his
comrade
you
did
it
that
is
well
now
see
here
one
word
of
me
now
or
ever
after
and
there
is
a
little
present
that
will
come
to
you
from
cigarette
said
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
with
a
sententious
sternness
the
unhappy
jew
shuddered
and
shut
his
eyes
as
she
held
a
bullet
close
to
his
sight
then
dropped
it
with
an
ominous
thud
in
her
pistol
barrel
not
a
syllable
never
a
syllable
he
stammered
and
if
i
had
known
you
were
in
love
with
him
a
box
on
the
ears
sent
him
across
his
own
counter
in
love
parbleu
i
detest
the
fellow
said
cigarette
with
fiery
scorn
and
as
hot
an
oath
truly
then
why
give
your
napoleons
began
the
bruised
and
stammering
israelite
cigarette
tossed
back
her
pretty
head
that
was
curly
and
spirited
and
shapely
as
any
thoroughbred
spaniel
a
superb
glance
flashed
from
her
eyes
a
superb
disdain
sat
on
her
lips
you
are
a
jew
trader
you
know
nothing
of
our
code
under
the
tricolor
we
are
too
proud
not
to
aid
even
an
enemy
when
he
is
in
the
right
and

magnificent
peroration
she
swept
all
the

they
were
rightfully
hers
off
the

they
will
light
my
cooking
fire
she
said
contemptuously
as
she
vaulted
lightly
over
the
counter
into
the
street
and
pirouetted
along
the
slope
of
the
crowded
babazoum
all
made
way
for
her
even
the
mighty
spahis
and
the
trudging
bedouin
mules
for
all
knew
that
if
they
did
not
she
would
make
it
for
herself
over
their
heads
or
above
their
prostrated
bodies
finally
she
whirled
herself
into
a
dark
deserted
moresco
archway
a
little
out
of
the
town
and
dropped
on
a
stone
block
as
a
swallow
tired
of
flight
drops
on

that
the

i

myself
ah
bah

to
be
killed

called
me

unsexed
unsexed
and
with
each
repetition
of
the
infamous
word
so
bitter
because
vaguely
admitted
to
be
true
with
her
cheeks
scarlet
and
her
eyes
aflame
and
her
hands
clinched
she
flung
one
of
the
ivory
wreathes
on
to
the
pavement
and
stamped
on
it
with
her
spurred
heel
until
the
carvings
were
ground
into
powdered
fragments
stamped
as
though
it
were
a
living
foe
and
her
foot
were
treading
out
all
its
life
with
burning
hate
and
pitiless
venom
in
the
act
her
passion
exhausted
itself
as
the
evil
of
such
warm
impetuous
tender
natures
will
she
was
very
still
and
looked
at
the
ruin
she
had
done
with
regret
and
a
touch
of
contrition
it
was
very
pretty
and
cost
him
weeks
of
labor
perhaps
she
thought
then
she
took
all
the
rest
up
one
by
one
and
gazed
at
them
things
of
beauty
had
had
but
little
place
in
her
lawless
young
life
what
she
thought
beautiful
was
a
regiment
sweeping
out
in
full
sunlight
with
its
eagles
and
its
colors
and
its
what
she
held
as
music
was
the
beat
of
the
reveille
and
the
mighty
roll
of
the
great
artillery
what
made
her
pulse
throb
and
her
heart
leap
was
to
see
two
fine
opposing
forces
draw
near
for
the
onslaught
and
thunder
of
battle
of
things
of
grace
she
had
no
heed
though
she
had
so
much
grace
herself
and
her
life
though
full
of
color
pleasure
and
mischief
was
as
rough
a
one
in
most
respects
as
any
of
her
comrades
these
delicate
artistic
carvings
were
a
revelation
to
her
she
touched
them
reverently
one
by
one
all
the
carvings
had
their
beauty
for
her
but
those
of
the
flowers
had
far
the
most
she
had
never
noted
any
flowers
in
her
life
before
save
those
she
strung
together
for
the
zephyrs
her
youth
was
a
military
ballad
rhymed
vivaciously
to
the
rhythm
of
the
pas
de
charge
but
other
or
softer
poetry
had
never
by
any
chance
touched
her
until
now
now
that
in
her
tiny
bronzed
palms
lay
the
while
foliage
the
delicate
of
this
chasseur
who
bartered
his
talent
to
get
a
touch
of
ice
for
the
burning
lips
of
his
doomed
comrade
he
is
an
aristocrat
he
has
such
gifts
as
this
and
yet
he
must
sell
all
this
beauty
to
get
a
slice
of
melon
for

strayed
in

twelve

in
high
popularity
with

and
had
said
but
the
truth
when
he
averred
that
he
had
never
been
so
happy
as
under
the
tricolor
the
officers
pronounced
him
an
incurably
audacious
pratique
he
was
always
in
mischief
and
the
regimental
rules
he
broke
through
like
a
terrier
through
a
gauze
net
but
they
knew
that
when
once
the
trumpets
sounded
boot
and
saddle
this
of
an
english
fellow
would
be
worth
a
score
of
more
orderly
soldiers
and
that
wherever
his
adopted
flag
was
carried
there
would
he
be
first
and
foremost
in
everything
save
retreat
the
english
service
had
failed
to
turn
rake
to
account
the
french
service
made
no
such
mistake
but
knew
that
though
this
british
bulldog
might
set
his
teeth
at
the
leash
and
the
lash
he
would
hold
on
like
grim
death
in
a
fight
and
live
game
to
the
last
if
well
handled
apart
at
the
head
of
the
barracks
sat
cecil
the
banter
the
songs
the
laughter
the
chorus
of
tongues
went
on
unslackened
by
his
presence
he
had
cordial
sympathies
with
the
soldiers
with
those
men
who
had
been
his
followers
in
adversity
and
danger
and
in
whom
he
had
found
despite
all
their
occasional
ferocity
and
habitual
recklessness
traits
and
touches
of
the
noblest
instincts
of
humanity
his
heart
was
with
them
always
as
his
purse
and
his
wine
and
his
bread
were
alike
shared
ever
among
them
he
had
learned
to
love
them
well
these
wild
whose
fangs
were
so
terrible
to
their
foes
but
whose
eyes
would
still
glisten
at
a
kind
word
and
who
would
give
a
staunch
fidelity
unknown
to
tamer
animals
living
with
them
one
of
them
in
all
their
vicissitudes
knowing
all
their
vices
but
knowing
also
all
their
virtues
owing
to
them
many
an
action
of
generous
nobility
and
watching
them
in
many
an
hour
when
their
gallant
and
their
loyal
friendships
went
far
to
redeem
their
lawless
robberies
and
their
ruthless
crimes
he
understood
them
thoroughly
and
he
could
rule
them
more
surely
in
their
tempestuous
evil
because
he
comprehended
them
so
well
in
their
mirth
and
in
their
better
moods
when
the
grade
of
gave
him
authority
over
them
they
obeyed
him
implicitly
because
they
knew
that
his
sympathies
were
with
them
at
all
times
and
that
he
would
be
the
last
to
check
their
gayety
or
to
punish
their
harmless
indiscretions
the
warlike
roumis
had
always
had
a
proud
tenderness
for
their
and
a
certain
wondering
respect
for
him
but
they
would
not
have
adored
him
to
a
man
as
they
did
unless
they
had
known
that
they
might
laugh
without
restraint
before
him
and
confide
any
dilemma
to
him
sure
of
aid
if
aid
were
in
his
power
the
laughter
the
work
and
the
clatter
of
conflicting
tongues
were
at
their
height
cecil
sat
now
listening
now
losing
himself
in
thought
while
he
gave
the
last
touch
to
the
carvings
before
him
they
were
a
set
of
chessmen
which
it
had
taken
him
years
to
find
materials
for
and
to
perfect
the
white
men
were
in
ivory
the
black
in
walnut
and
were
two
opposing
squadrons
of
french
troops
and
of
mounted
arabs
beautifully
carved
with
every
detail
of
costume
rigid
to
truth
they
were
his
masterpiece
though
they
had
only
been
taken
up
at
any
odd
ten
minutes
that
had
happened
to
be
unoccupied
during
the
last
three
or
four
years
the
chessmen
had
been
about
with
him
in
so
many
places
and
under
canvas
so
long
from
the
time
that
he
chipped
out
their
first
zouave
pawn
as
he
lay
in
the
broiling
heat
of
oran
prostrate
by
a
dry
brook
stony
channel
that
he
scarcely
cared
to
part
with
them
and
had
refused
to
let
rake
offer
them
for
sale
with
all
the
rest
of
the
carvings
stooping
over
them
he
did
not
notice
the
doors
open
at
the
end
of
the
barracks
until
a
sudden
silence
that
fell
on
the
babble
and
uproar
round
him
made
him
look
up
then
he
rose
and
gave
the
salute
with
the
rest
of
his
discomfited
and
awestricken
troopers

brilliant

enough
to

commandant
he
spoke
simply
gently
boldly
standing
with
the
ceremony
that
he
never
forgot
to
show
to
their
chief
where
the
glow
of
african
sunlight
through
the
casement
of
the
barracks
fell
full
across
his
face
and
his
eyes
met
the
dark
glance
of
the
black
hawk
unflinchingly
he
never
heeded
that
there
was
a
gay
varied
numerous
group
behind
chateauroy
visitors
who
were
looking
over
the
barrack
he
only
heeded
that
his
soldiers
were
unjustly
attacked
and
menaced
the
marquis
gave
a
grim
significant
smile
that
cut
like
so
much
cord
of
the
scourge
wherever
there
is
insubordination
in
the
regiment
the
blame
is
very
certain
to
be
yours
corporal
victor
if
you
allow
your
chambre
to
be
turned
into
the
riot
of

so
signally

to

far
less
than
the
tone
they
were
spoken
in
that
gave
them
all
the
insolence
of
so
many
blows
as
he
swung
on
his
heel
and
bent
to
the
ladies
of
the
party
he
escorted
cecil
stood
mute
bearing
the
rebuke
as
it
became
a
corporal
to
bear
his
commander
anger
a
very
keen
observer
might
have
seen
that
a
faint
flush
rose
over
the
sun
tan
of
his
face
and
that
his
teeth
clinched
under
his
beard
but
he
let
no
other
sign
escape
him
the
very
irritated
chateauroy
who
would
have
been
the
first
to
chastise
the
presumption
of
a
reply
had
any
been
attempted
back
to
your
place
sir
he
said
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
as
he
might
have
waved
back
a
cur
teach
your
men
the
first
formula
of
obedience
at
any
rate
cecil
fell
back
in
silence
with
a
swift
warning
glance
at
rake
whose
mouth
was
working
and
whose
forehead
was
hot
as
fire
where
he
clinched
his
and
longed
to
be
once
free
to
pull
his
chief
down
as
lions
pull
in
the
death
spring
he
went
to
his
place
at
the
farther
end
of
the
chamber
and
stood
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
chess
carvings
lest
the
control
which
was
so
bitter
to
retain
should
be
broken
if
he
looked
on
at
the
man
who
had
been
the
curse
and
the
antagonist
of
his
whole
life
in
algeria
he
saw
nothing
and
heard
almost
as
little
of
all
that
went
on
around
him
there
had
been
a
flutter
of
color
in
his
sight
a
faint
dreamy
fragrance
on
the
air
a
sound
of
murmuring
voices
and
of
low
laughter
he
had
known
that
some
guests
or
friends
of
the
marquis
had
come
to
view
the
barracks
but
he
never
even
glanced
to
see
who
or
what
they
were
the
passionate
bitterness
of
just
hatred
that
he
had
to
choke
down
as
though
it
were
the
infamous
instinct
of
some
nameless
crime
was
on
him
the
moments
passed
the
hum
of
the
voices
floated
to
his
ear
the
ladies
of
the
party
lingered
by
this
soldier
and
by
that
buying
half
the
things
in
the
chamber
filling
their
hands
with
all
the
quaint
trifles
ordering
the
daggers
and
the
flissas
and
the
ornamented
saddles
and
the
desert
skins
to
adorn
their
chateaux
at
home
and
raining
down
on
the
troopers
a
shower
of
uncounted
napoleons
until
the
chasseurs
who
had
begun
to
think
their
trades
would
take
them
to
beylick
thought
instead
that
they
had
drifted
into
dreams
of
el
dorado
he
never
looked
up
he
heard
nothing
heeded
nothing
he
was
dreamily
wondering
whether
he
should
always
be
able
so
to
hold
his
peace
and
to
withhold
his
arm
that
he
should
never
strike
his
tyrant
down
with
one
blow
in
which
all
the
opprobrium
of
years
should
be
stamped
out
a
voice
woke
him
from
his
reverie
are
those
beautiful
carvings
yours
he
looked
up
and
in
the
gloom
of
the
alcove
where
he
stood
where
the
sun
did
not
stray
and
two
great
rugs
of
various
skins
with
some
conquered
banners
of
bedouins
hung
like
a
black
pall
he
saw
a
eyes
resting
on
him
proud
lustrous
eyes
a
little
haughty
very
thoughtful
yet
soft
withal
as
the
deepest
hue
of
deep
waters
he
bowed
to
her
with
the
old
grace
of
manner
that
had
so
amused
and
amazed
the
little
vivandiere
yes
madame
they
are
ah
what
wonderful
skill
she
took
the

an
arab
sheik
on
his
charger
in
her
hand
and
turned
to
those
about
her
speaking
of
its
beauties
and
its
workmanship
in
a
voice
low
very
melodious
ever
so
slightly
languid
that
fell
on
cecil
ear
like
a
chime
of
music
twelve
years
had
drifted
by
since
he
had
been
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
and
those
lingering
delicate
tones
had
the
note
of
his
dead
past
he
looked
at
her
at
the
gleam
of
the
brilliant
hair
at
the
arch
of
the
proud
brows
at
the
dreaming
imperial
eyes
it
was
a
face
singularly
dazzling
impressive
and
beautiful
at
all
times
most
so
of
all
in
the
dusky
shadows
of
the
waving
desert
banners
and
the
rough
rude
barbaric
life
of
the
caserne
where
a
fille
de
joie
or
a
cantiniere
were
all
of
her
sex
that
was
ever
seen
and
those
poor
wretches
were
hardened
and
bronzed
and
beaten
and
out
of
all
likeness
to
the
fairness
of
women
you
have
an
exquisite
art
they
are
for
sale
she
asked
him
she
spoke
with
the
careless
gracious
courtesy
of
a
grande
dame
to
a
corporal
of
chasseurs
looking
little
at
him
much
at
the
kings
and
their
mimic
hosts
of
zouaves
and
bedouins
they
are
at
your
service
and
their
price
she
had
been
purchasing
largely
of
the
men
on
all
sides
as
she
swept
down
the
length
of
the
chambre
and
she
drew
out
some
french
banknotes
as
she
spoke
never
had
the
bitterness
of
poverty
smitten
him
as
it
smote
him
now
when
this
young
patrician
offered
him
her
gold
old
habits
vanquished
he
forgot
who
and
where
he
now
was
he
bowed
as
in
other
days
he
had
used
to
bow
in
the
circle
of
james
is
the
honor
of
your
acceptance
if
you
will
deign
to
give
he
forgot
that
he
was
not
as
he
once
had
been
he
forgot
that
he
stood
but
as
a
private
of
the
french
army
before
an
aristocrat
whose
name
he
had
never
heard
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
which
she
had
never
done
before
so
absorbed
had
she
been
in
the
chessmen
and
so
little
did
a
chasseur
of
the
ranks
pass
into
her
thoughts
there
was
an
extreme
of
surprise
there
was
something
of
offense
and
there
was
still
more
of
coldness
in
her
glance
a
proud
languid
astonished
coldness
of
regard
though
it
softened
slightly
as
she
saw
that
he
had
spoken
in
all
courtesy
of
intent
she
bent
her
graceful
regal
head
i
thank
you
your
very
clever
work
can
of
course
only
be
mine
by
and
with
that
she
laid
aside
the
white
king
among
his
little
troop
of
ivory
arabs
and
floated
onward
with
her
friends
cecil
face
paled
slightly
under
the
mellow
tint
left
there
by
the
desert
sun
and
the
desert
wind
he
swept
the
chessmen
into
their
walnut
case
and
thrust
them
out
of
sight
under
his
knapsack
then
he
stood
motionless
as
a
sentinel
with
the
great
leopard
skins
and
bedouin
banners
behind
him
casting
a
gloom
that
the
gold
points
on
his
harness
could
scarcely
break
in
its
heavy
shadow
and
never
moved
till
the
echo
of
the
voices
and
the
cloud
of
draperies
and
the
fragrance
of
perfumed
laces
and
the
brilliancy
of
the
staff
officers
uniforms
had
passed
away
and
left
the
soldiers
alone
in
their
chambre
those
careless
cold
words
from
a
woman
lips
had
cut
him
deeper
than
the
stick
could
have
cut
him
though
it
had
bruised
his
loins
and
lashed
his
breast
they
showed
all
he
had
lost
what
a
fool
i
am
still
he
thought
as
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
barrack
room
i
might
have
fairly
forgotten
by
this
time
that
i
ever
had
the
rights
of
a
so
the
carvings
had
won
him
one
warm
heart
and
one
keen
pang
that
day
the
vivandiere
forgave
the
aristocrat
stung
him
by
means
of
those
snowy
fragile
artistic
toys
that
he
had
shaped
in
lonely
nights
under
canvas
by
ruddy
beneath
the
shade
of
wild
fig
trees
and
in
the
stir
and
color
of
bedouin
encampments
i
must
ask
to
be
ordered
out
of
the
city
he
thought
as
he
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowds
of
soldiers
and
civilians
here
i
get
bitter
restless
impatient
here
the
past
is
always
touching
me
on
the
shoulder
here
i
shall
soon
grow
to
regret
and
to
chafe
and
to
look
back
like
any
pining
woman
out
yonder
there
with
no
cares
to
think
of
but
my
horse
and
my
troop
i
am
a
soldier
and
nothing
else
so
best
i
shall
be
nothing
else
as
long
as
i
live
pardieu
though
i
do
know
what
one
wants
better
it
is
a
good
life
as
life
goes
one
must
not
turn
compliments
to
great
ladies
that
is
all
not
much
of
a
deprivation
there
the
chessmen
are
the
better
for
that
her
maltese
dog
would
have
broken
them
all
the
first
time
it
upset
their
table
he
laughed
a
little
as
he
went
on
smoking
the
old
carelessness
mutability
and
indolent
philosophies
were
with
him
still
and
were
still
inclined
to
thrust
away
and
glide
from
all
pain
as
it
arose
though
much
of
gravity
and
of
thoughtfulness
had
stolen
on
him
much
of
insouciance
remained
and
there
were
times
when
there
was
not
a
more
reckless
or
a
more
nonchalant
lion
in
all
the
battalions
than
under
his
gentleness
there
was
wild
blood
in
him
still
and
the
wildness
was
not
tamed
by
the
fiery
of
the
perilous
adventurous
years
he
spent
i
wonder
if
i
shall
never
teach
the
black
hawk
that
he
may
strike
his
beak
in
once
too
far
he
pondered
with
a
sudden
darker
graver
touch
of
musing
and
involuntarily
he
stretched
his
arm
out
and
looked
at
the
wrist
supple
as
damascus
steel
and
at
the
muscles
that
were
traced
beneath
the
skin
as
he
thrust
the
sleeve
up
clear
firm
and
sinewy
as
any
athlete
he
doubted
his
countenance
then
fast
rein
as
he
held
all
rebellion
in
close
shield
as
he
bound
to
him
against
his
own
passions
in
the
breastplate
of
a
soldier
first
duty
obedience
he
shook
the
thought
off
him
as
he
would
have
shaken
a
snake
it
had
a
terrible
temptation
a
temptation
which
he
knew
might
any
day
overmaster
him
and
cecil
who
all
through
his
life
had
certain
inborn
instincts
of
honor
which
served
him
better
than
most
codes
or
creeds
served
their
professors
was
resolute
to
follow
the
military
religion
of
obedience
enjoined
in
the
service
that
had
received
him
at
his
needs
and
to
give
no
precedent
in
his
own
person
that
could
be
fraught
with
dangerous
rebellious
allurement
for
the
untamed
chafing
spirits
of
his
comrades
for
whom
he
knew
insubordination
would
be
ruin
and
death
whose
one
chance
of
reward
of
success
and
of
a
higher
ambition
lay
in
their
implicit
subordination
to
their
chiefs
and
their
continuous
resistance
of
every
rebellious
impulse
cecil
had
always
thought
very
little
of
himself
in
his
most
brilliant
and
pampered
days
he
had
always
considered
in
his
own
heart
that
he
was
a
graceless
fellow
not
worth
his
salt
and
had
occasionally
wondered
in
a
listless
sort
of
way
why
so
useless
a
bagatelle
a
la
mode
as
his
own
life
was
had
ever
been
created
he
thought
much
the
same
now
but
following
his
natural
instincts
which
were
always
the
instincts
of
a
gentleman
and
of
a
generous
temper
he
did
unconsciously
make
his
life
of
much
value
among
its
present
comrades
his
influence
had
done
more
to
humanize
the
men
he
was
associated
with
than
any
preachers
or
teachers
could
have
done
the
most
savage
and
obscene
brute
in
the
ranks
with
him
caught
something
gentler
and
better
from
the
his
refined
habits
his
serene
temper
his
kindly
forbearance
his
high
instinctive
honor
made
themselves
felt
imperceptibly
but
surely
they
knew
that
he
was
as
fearless
in
war
as
eager
for
danger
as
themselves
they
knew
that
he
was
no
saint
but
loved
the
smile
of
women
eyes
the
flush
of
wines
and
the
excitation
of
gaming
hazards
as
well
as
they
did
and
hence
his
influence
had
a
weight
that
probably
a
more
strictly
virtuous
man
would
have
strained
for
and
missed
forever
the
coarsest
ruffian
felt
ashamed
to
make
an
utter
beast
of
himself
before
the
calm
eyes
of
the
patrician
the
most
lawless
pratique
felt
a
lie
halt
on
his
lips
when
the
contemptuous
glance
of
his
taught
him
that
falsehood
was
poltroonery
blasphemous
tongues
learned
to
rein
in
their
filthiness
when
this
beau
lion
sauntered
away
from
the
on
an
icy
night
to
be
out
of
hearing
of
their
witless
obscenities
more
than
once
the
weight
of
his
arm
and
the
slash
of
his
saber
had
called
them
to
account
in
fiery
fashion
for
their
brutality
to
women
or
their
thefts
from
the
country
people
till
they
grew
aware
that
would
risk
having
all
their
swords
buried
in
him
rather
than
stand
by
to
see
injustice
done
and
throughout
his
corps
men
became
unconsciously
gentler
juster
with
a
finer
sense
of
right
and
wrong
and
less
bestial
modes
of
pleasure
of
speech
and
of
habit
because
he
was
among
them
moreover
the
desperadoes
who
made
up
the
chief
sum
of
his
comrades
saw
that
he
gave
unquestioning
respect
to
a
chief
who
made
his
life
a
hell
and
rendered
unquestioning
submission
under
affronts
tyrannies
and
insults
which
as
they
also
saw
stung
him
to
the
quick
and
tortured
him
as
no
physical
torture
would
have
done
and
the
sight
was
not
without
a
strong
effect
for
good
on
them
they
could
tell
that
he
suffered
under
these
as
they
never
suffered
themselves
yet
he
bore
them
and
did
his
duty
with
a
and
patience
they
had
never
attained
almost
insensibly
they
grew
ashamed
to
be
beaten
by
him
and
strove
to
grow
like
him
as
far
as
they
could
they
never
knew
him
drunk
they
never
heard
him
swear
they
never
found
him
unjust
even
to
a
indigene
or
brutal
even
to
a
fille
de

insensibly
his
presence
humanized
them
of

the

of

was
that
of

yet
here

it

if

would
ever
have

half
the
good
among

wakened
cecil
from
his
musing
as
he
went
on
his
way
down
the
crowded
tortuous
stifling
street
he
had
scarcely
time
to
catch
the
sense
of
the
words
and
to
halt
giving
the
salute
before
the

skittish

had
galloped
past
him
scattering
the

right
and
left
knocking
over
a

upsetting
a
string
of
mules
jostling
a
venerable
marabout
on
to
an
impudent
little
grisette
and
laming
an
old
moor
as
he
tottered
to
his
mosque
without
any
apology
for
any
of
the
mischief
in
the
customary
insolence
which
makes

execrated
by

detestation

do
very
little
to

the
fiery

of

cecil
involuntarily
stood
still
his
face
darkened
all
orders
that
touched
on
the

even
where
harshest
and
most
unwelcome

had
taught

cecil
looked
up
in
astonishment
at
the
divination
and
translation
of
his
thoughts
to
encounter
the
bright
falcon
eyes
of
cigarette
looking
down
on
him
from
a
little
oval
casement
above
dark
as
pitch
within
and
whose
embrasure
with
its
rim
of
gray
stone
coping
set
off
like
a
with
a
heavy
background
of
unglazed
rembrandt

the
piquant
head
of
the

of

he
answered
with
a
little
weariness
lifting
his
fez
to
her
with
a
certain
sense
of
annoyance
that
this
young
bohemian
of
the

this

with

and
her
satire
should
always
be
in

to

the

for

he
would
have
responded
with
some
such
florid
compliment
as
those
for
which
she
was
accustomed
to
box
the
ears
of

and
would
have
swung

up

floated

as
though

she
was
very
proud
of

glorified

he
listened
amused
with

boastful

but
the
last
words
touched
him
with
a
certain
pang
just
in

and
wonder
at
him
that
she
had
felt
when
the
ivory
wreaths
and
crucifixes
had
lain
in
her
hands
she
knew
she
had
been
ungenerous
a
crime
dark
as
night
in
the
sight
of
the
little
chivalrous
soldier
ah
she
said
softly
and
waywardly
winding
her
way
aright
with
that
penetration
and
tact
which
however
unsexed
in
other
things
cigarette
had
kept
thoroughly
feminine
that
was
but
an
idle
word
of
mine
forgive
it
and
forget
it
you
are
not
a
slave
when
you
fight
in
the
fantasias
morbleu
they
say
to
see
you
kill
a
man
is
beautiful
so
workmanlike
and
you
would
go
out
and
be
shot
rather
than
sell
your
honor
or
stain
it
bah
while
you
know
they
should
cut
your
heart
out
rather
than
make
you
tell
a
lie
or
betray
a
comrade
you
are
no
slave
you
have
the
best
freedom
of
all
take
a
glass
of
champagne
how
you
look
oh
the
demoiselles
with
the
silver
necks
are
not
barrack
drink
of
course
but
i
drink
champagne
always
myself
this
is
le
prince
he
knows
i
only
take
the
best
with
which
cigarette
leaning
down
from
her
casement
whose
sill
was
about
a
foot
above
his
head
tendered
her
in
a
bottle
three
of
which
packed
in
her
knapsack
she
had
carried
off
from
the
of
a
russian
prince
who
was
touring
through
algiers
and
who
had
half
lost
his
grand
ducal
head
after
the
bewitching
dauntless
capricious
unattachable
unpurchasable
and
coquettish
little
of
the
spahis
who
treated
him
with
infinitely
more
insolence
and
indifference
than
she
would
show
to
some
battered
old
veteran
or
some
old
dog
who
had
passed
through
the
great
kabaila
raids
and
battles
you
will
go
to
your
colonel
she
said
questioningly
as
he
drank
the
champagne
and
thanked
her
for
he
saw
the
spirit
in
which
the
gift
was
tendered
as
he
leaned
against
the
moorish
wall
with
its
striped
awning
spread
over
both
their
heads
in
the
little
street
whose
crowds
chatter
thousand
eyes
and
incessant
traffic
no
way
troubled
cigarette
who
had
talked
argot
to
monarchs
undaunted
and
who
had
been
one
of
the
chief
sights
in
a
hundred
grand
reviews
ever
since
she
had
been
perched
on
a
at
five
years
old
and
paraded
with
a
troop
of
horse
artillery
in
the
champ
de
mars
as
having
gone
through
the
whole
of
bugeaud
campaign
at
which
parade
by
the
way
being
tendered
sweetmeats
by
a
famous
general
wife
cigarette
had
made
the
immortal
reply
madame
my
sweetmeats
are
bullets
she
repeated
her
question
imperiously
as
cecil
kept
silent
you
will
go
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
did
not
care
to
discuss
his
orders
with
this
pretty
little
bacchante
oh
a
chief
command
you
know
ah
a
fig
for
a
chief
retorted
cigarette
impatiently
why
do
you
say
the
truth
you
are
thinking
you
will
disobey
and
risk
the
rest
well
why
not
i
grant
his
right
in
barrack
and
field
but
he
spoke
rather
to
himself
than
her
and
his
thoughts
as
he
spoke
went
back
to
the
scene
of
the
morning
he
felt
with
a
romantic
impulse
that
he
smiled
at
even
as
it
passed
over
him
that
he
would
rather
have
half
a
dozen
muskets
fired
at
him
in
the
of
a
mutineer
than
meet
again
the
glance
of
those
proud
azure
eyes
sweeping
over
him
in
their
calm
indifference
to
a
private
of
chasseurs
their
calm
ignorance
that
he
could
be
wounded
or
be
stung
but
echoed
cigarette
leaning
out
of
her
oval
hole
perched
in
the
quaint
gray
moresco
wall
with
broken
encaustics
of
varied
hues
chut
bon
comrade
that
little
word
has
been
the
undoing
of
the
world
ever
since
the
world
began
is
a
blank
cartridge
and
never
did
anything
but
miss
fire
yet
shoot
dead
or
do
aim
at
all
whichever
you
like
but
never
make
a
false
stroke
with
so
you
wo
obey
chateauroy
in
this
he
was
silent
again
he
would
not
answer
falsely
and
he
did
not
care
to
say
his
thoughts
to
her
pursued
cigarette
translating
his
silence
at
her
fancy
you
say
to
yourself
am
an
aristocrat
i
will
not
be
ordered
in
this
thing
you
say
am
a
good
soldier
i
will
not
be
sent
for
like
a
hawker
you
say
was
noble
once
i
will
show
my
blood
at
last
if
i
die
ah
you
say
that
he
laughed
a
little
as
he
looked
up
at
her
not
exactly
that
but
something
as
foolish
perhaps
are
you
a
witch
my
pretty
one
whoever
doubted
it
except
you
she
looked
one
in
truth
whom
few
men
could
resist
bending
to
him
out
of
her
owls
nest
with
the
flash
of
the
sun
under
the
blue
awning
brightly
catching
the
sunny
brown
of
her
soft
cheek
and
the
cherry
bloom
of
her
lips
arched
pouting
and
coquette
she
set
her
teeth
sharply
and
muttered
a
hot
heavy
sacre
or
even
something
worse
as
she
saw
that
his
eyes
had
not
even
remained
on
her
but
were
thoughtfully
looking
down
the
checkered
light
and
color
of
the
street
she
was
passionate
she
was
vain
she
was
wayward
she
was
fierce
as
a
little
velvet
leopard
as
a
handsome
brilliant
plumaged
hawk
she
had
all
the
faults
as
she
had
all
the
virtues
of
the
thorough
celtic
race
and
for
the
moment
she
had
in
instinct
fiery
ruthless
and
full
of
hate
to
draw
the
pistol
out
of
her
belt
and
teach
him
with
a
shot
crash
through
heart
or
brain
that
girls
who
were
unsexed
could
keep
enough
of
the
woman
in
them
not
to
be
neglected
with
impunity
and
could
lose
enough
of
it
to
be
able
to
avenge
the
negligence
by
a
summary
vendetta
but
she
was
a
haughty
little
condottiere
in
her
fashion
she
would
not
ask
for
what
was
not
offered
her
nor
give
a
rebuke
that
might
be
traced
to
mortification
she
only
set
her
two
in
as
firm
a
line
of
wrath
and
scorn
as
ever
caesar
or
napoleon
molded
themselves
into
and
spoke
in
the
curt
imperious
generalissimo
fashion
with
which
cigarette
before
now
had
rallied
a
demoralized
troop
reeling
drunk
and
mad
away
from
a
razzia
i
am
a
witch
that
is
i
can
put
two
and
two
together
and
read
men
though
i
do
read
the
alphabet
well
one
reading
is
a
good
deal
rarer
than
the
other
so
you
mean
to
disobey
the
hawk
i
like
you
for
that
but
listen
here
did
you
ever
hear
them
talk
of
marquise
no
parbleu
swore
the
vivandiere
in
her
wrath
you
look
on
at
a
bamboula
as
if
it
were
only
a
dancing
and
can
only
give
one
and
as
if
one
were
a
bah
are
those
your
paris
courtesies
forgive
me
ma
belle
i
thought
you
called
yourself
our
comrade
and
would
have
no
manners
there
is
no
knowing
how
to
please
he
might
have
pleased
her
simply
and
easily
enough
if
he
had
only
looked
up
with
a
shade
of
interest
to
that
most
picturesque
picture
bright
as
a
pastel
portrait
that
was
hung
above
him
in
the
old
moorish
stonework
but
his
thoughts
were
with
other
things
and
a
love
scene
with
this
fantastic
little
amazon
did
not
attract
him
the
warm
ripe
mellow
little
wayside
cherry
hung
directly
in
his
path
with
the
sun
on
its
bloom
and
the
free
wind
tossing
it
merrily
but
it
had
no
charm
for
him
he
was
musing
rather
on
that
costly
delicate
hothouse
blossom
that
could
only
be
reached
down
by
some
rich
man
hand
and
grew
afar
on
heights
where
never
winter
chills
nor
summer
tan
could
come
too
rudely
on
it
come
tell
me
what
is
marquise
a
kitten
he
went
on
leaning
his
arm
still
on
the
sill
of
her
embrasure
and
willing
to
coax
her
out
of
her
anger
a
kitten
echoed
cigarette
contemptuously
you
think
me
a
child
i
suppose
surely
you
are
not
far
off
it
mon
dieu
why
i
was
never
a
child
in
my
life
retorted
cigarette
waxing
and
confidential
again
while
she
perched
herself
like
some
mockingbird
on
a
branch
on
the
itself
when
i
was
two
i
used
to
be
beaten
when
i
was
three
i
used
to
scrape
up
the
cigar
ends
the
officers
dropped
about
to
sell
them
again
for
a
bit
of
black
bread
when
i
was
four
i
knew
all
about
philippe
durron
escape
from
beylick
and
bit
my
tongue
through
to
say
nothing
when
my
mother
flogged
me
with
a
because
i
would
not
tell
that
she
might
tell
again
at
the
bureau
and
get
the
reward
a
child
before
i
was
two
feet
high
i
had
winged
my
first
arab
he
stole
a
rabbit
i
was
roasting
presto
how
quick
he
dropped
it
when
my
ball
broke
his
wrist
like
a
twig
and
the
friend
of
the
flag
laughed
gayly
at
the
recollection
as
at
the
best
piece
of
mirth
with
which
memory
could
furnish
her
but
you
asked
about
marquise
well
he
was
what
you
are
a
hawk
among
carrion
crows
a
gentleman
in
the
ranks
dieu
how
handsome
he
was
nobody
ever
knew
his
real
name
but
they
thought
he
was
of
austrian
breed
and
we
called
him
marquise
because
he
was
so
womanish
white
in
his
skin
and
dainty
in
all
his
ways
just
like
you
marquise
could
fight
fight
like
a
hundred
devils
and
pouf
how
proud
he
was
very
much
like
you
altogether
now
one
day
something
went
wrong
in
the
exercise
ground
marquise
was
not
to
blame
but
they
thought
he
was
and
an
adjutant
struck
him
flick
flack
like
that
across
the
face
with
a
riding
switch
marquise
had
his
bayonet
fixed
and
before
we
knew
what
was
up
crash
the
blade
went
through
through
the
and
out
at
the
spine
and
the
adjutant
fell
as
dead
as
a
cat
with
the
blood
spouting
out
like
a
fountain
come
of
a
great
race
that
never
took
insult
without
giving
back
death
was
all
that
marquise
said
when
they
seized
him
and
brought
him
to
judgment
and
he
would
never
say
of
what
race
that
was
they
shot
him
ah
bah
discipline
must
be
kept
and
i
saw
him
with
five
great
wounds
in
his
chest
and
his
beautiful
golden
hair
all
soiled
with
the
sand
and
the
powder
lying
there
by
the
open
grave
that
they
threw
him
into
as
if
he
were
offal
and
we
never
knew
more
of
him
than
cigarette
radiant
laugh
had
died
and
her
careless
voice
had
sunk
over
the
latter
words
as
the
little
vivacious
brunette
told
the
tale
of
a
nameless
life
it
took
its
eloquence
from
her
simple
and
brief
as
her
speech
was
and
it
owned
a
deeper
pathos
because
the
reckless
young
bacchante
of
the
as
de
pique
grew
grave
one
moment
while
she
told
it
then
grave
still
she
leaned
her
brown
bright
face
nearer
down
from
her
oval
hole
in
the
wall
now
she
whispered
very
low
if
you
mutiny
once
they
will
shoot
you
just
like
marquise
and
you
will
die
just
as
silent
like
well
he
answered
her
slowly
why
not
death
is
no
great
terror
i
risk
it
every
day
for
the
sake
of
a
common
soldier
rations
why
should
i
not
chance
it
for
the
sake
and
in
the
defense
of
my
honor
bah
men
sell
their
honor
for
their
daily
bread
all
the
world
over
said
cigarette
with
the
satire
that
had
treble
raciness
from
the
slang
in
which
she
clothed
it
but
it
is
not
you
alone
see
here
one
example
set
on
your
part
and
half
your
regiment
will
mutiny
too
it
is
bitter
work
to
obey
the
black
hawk
and
if
you
give
the
signal
of
revolt
three
parts
of
your
comrades
will
join
you
now
what
will
that
end
in
beau
lion
tell
me
you
are
a
soldier
yourself
you
yes
i
am
a
soldier
said
cigarette
between
her
teeth
while
her
eyes
brightened
and
her
voice
sank
down
into
a
whisper
that
had
a
certain
terrible
meaning
in
it
like
the
first
dropping
of
the
scattered
opening
shots
in
the
distance
before
a
great
battle
commences
and
i
have
seen
war
not
holiday
war
but
war
in
earnest
war
when
men
fall
like
hailstones
and
tear
like
tigers
and
choke
like
mad
dogs
with
their
throats
full
of
blood
and
sand
when
the
wheels
go
crash
over
the
writhing
limbs
and
the
horses
charge
full
gallop
over
the
living
faces
and
the
hoofs
beat
out
the
brains
before
death
has
stunned
them
senseless
oh
yes
i
am
a
soldier
and
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
i
have
seen
i
have
seen
soldiers
mutiny
a
squadron
of
them
because
they
hated
their
chief
and
loved
two
of
their
and
i
have
seen
the
end
of
it
all
a
few
hundred
men
blind
and
drunk
with
despair
at
bay
against
as
many
thousands
and
walled
in
with
four
lines
of
steel
and
artillery
and
fired
on
from
a
score
of
volley
on
volley
like
the
thunder
till
not
one
living
man
was
left
and
there
was
only
a
shapeless
heaving
moaning
mass
with
the
black
smoke
over
all
that
is
what
i
have
seen
you
will
not
make
me
see
it
again
her
face
was
very
earnest
very
eloquent
very
dark
and
tender
with
thought
there
was
a
vein
of
grave
even
of
intense
feeling
that
ran
through
the
significant
words
to
which
tone
and
accent
lent
far
more
meaning
than
lay
in
their
mere
phrases
the
little
bohemian
lost
her
insolence
when
she
pleaded
for
her
children
her
comrades
and
the
mischievous
pet
of
the
camp
never
treated
lightly
what
touched
the
france
that
she
loved
the
france
that
alone
of
all
things
in
her
careless
life
she
held
in
honor
and
reverence
you
will
not
make
me
see
it
again
she
said
once
more
leaning
out
with
her
eyes
that
were
like
a
brown
brook
sparkling
deep
yet
bright
in
the
sun
fixed
on
him
they
would
rise
at
your
bidding
and
they
would
be
mowed
down
like
corn
you
will
not
never
i
give
you
my
the
promise
was
from
his
heart
he
would
have
endured
any
indignity
any
outrage
rather
than
have
drawn
into
ruin
through
him
the
fiery
fearless
untutored
lives
of
the
men
who
marched
and
slept
and
rode
and
fought
and
lay
in
the
light
of
the
and
swept
down
through
the
hot
sandstorms
on
to
the
desert
foe
by
his
side
cigarette
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
that
tiny
brown
hand
which
small
though
it
was
had
looked
so
burned
and
so
hard
beside
the
delicate
fairy
ivory
carvings
of
his
workmanship
stretched
it
out
with
a
frank
winning
childlike
soldierlike
grace
that
right
you
are
a
true
soldier
he
bent
over
the
hand
she
held
to
his
in
the
courtesy
natural
with
him
to
all
her
sex
and
touched
it
lightly
with
his
lips
thank
you
my
little
comrade
he
said
simply
with
the
graver
thought
still
on
him
that
her
relation
and
her
entreaty
had
evoked
you
have
given
me
a
lesson
that
i
shall
not
be
quick
to
cigarette
was
the
wildest
little
baccanal
that
ever
pirouetted
for
the
delight
of
half
a
score
of
soldiers
in
their
and
she
was
the
most
reckless
coquette
that
ever
made
the
of
her
lovers
range
from
to
plowboy
conscripts
she
had
flirted
as
far
and
wide
as
the
butterfly
flirts
with
the
blossoms
it
flutters
on
to
through
the
range
of
a
summer
day
she
took
kisses
if
the
giver
of
them
were
handsome
as
readily
as
a
child
takes
sweetmeats
at
mardi
gras
and
of
feminine
honor
feminine
scruples
feminine
delicacy
knew
nothing
save
by
such
very
dim
fragmentary
instincts
as
nature
still
planted
in
scant
growth
amid
the
rank
soil
and
the
pestilent
atmosphere
of
her
eyes
had
never
sunk
her
face
had
never
flushed
her
heart
had
never
panted
for
the
boldest
or
the
wildest
wooer
of
them
all
from
de
duc
lauzunesque
blandishments
to
or
rough
overtures
she
had
the
coquetry
of
her
nation
with
the
audacity
of
a
boy
now
only
for
the
first
time
cigarette
colored
hotly
at
the
grave
graceful
distant
salute
so
cold
and
so
courteous
which
was
offered
her
in
lieu
of
the
rude
and
boisterous
familiarities
to
which
she
was
accustomed
and
drew
her
hand
away
with
what
was
to
the
shame
of
her
soldierly
hardihood
and
her
barrack
tutelage
very
nearly
akin
to
an
impulse
of
shyness
dame
do
humbug
me
i
am
not
a
court
lady
she
cried
hastily
almost
petulantly
to
cover
the
unwonted
and
unwelcome
weakness
while
to
make
good
the
declaration
and
revindicate
her
military
renown
she
balanced
herself
lightly
on
the
stone
ledge
of
her
oval
hole
and
sprang
with
a
young
wildcat
easy
vaulting
leap
over
his
head
and
over
the
heads
of
the
people
beneath
on
to
the
ledge
of
the
house
opposite
a
whose
upper
story
nearly
touched
the
leaning
walls
of
the
old
moorish
buildings
in
which
she
had
been
perched
the
crowd
in
the
street
below
looked
up
amazed
and
aghast
at
that
bound
from
casement
to
casement
as
she
flew
over
their
heads
like
a
winged
bird
of
oran
but
they
laughed
as
they
saw
who
it
was
it
is
cigarette
ah
ha
the
devil
for
a
certainty
must
have
been
her
father
to
be
sure
cried
the
friend
of
the
flag
looking
from
her
elevation
he
is
a
very
good
father
too
and
i
do
tease
him
like
his
sons
the
priests
but
i
have
told
him
to
take
you
the
next
time
you
are
stripping
a
dead
body
so
look
on
it
he
wo
have
to
wait
the
discomfited
indigene
hustled
his
way
with
many
an
oath
through
the
laughing
crowd
as
best
he
might
and
cigarette
with
an
airy
pirouette
on
the
roof
that
would
have
done
honor
to
any
opera
boards
and
was
executed
as
carelessly
twenty
feet
above
earth
as
if
she
had
been
a
all
her
days
let
herself
down
by
the
awning
hand
over
hand
like
a
little
mouse
from
the
harbor
jumped
on
to
a
forage
wagon
that
was
just
passing
full
trot
down
the
street
and
disappeared
standing
on
the
piles
of
hay
and
singing
cecil
looked
after
her
with
a
certain
touch
of
pity
for
her
in
him
what
a
gallant
boy
is
spoiled
in
that
little
amazon
he
thought
the
quick
flush
of
her
face
the
quick
withdrawal
of
her
hand
he
had
not
noticed
she
had
not
much
interest
for
him
scarcely
any
indeed
save
that
he
saw
she
was
pretty
with
a
mignonne
mischievous
face
that
all
the
of
africa
and
all
the
wild
life
of
the
caserne
would
not
harden
or
debase
but
he
was
sorry
a
child
so
bright
and
so
brave
should
be
turned
into
three
parts
a
trooper
as
she
was
should
have
been
tossed
up
on
the
scum
and
filth
of
the
lowest
barrack
life
and
should
be
doomed
in
a
few
years
time
to
become
the
yellow
battered
that
premature
old
age
would
surely
render
the
darling
of
the
tricolor
the
pythoness
of
the
as
de
pique
cigarette
was
making
scorn
of
her
doom
of
sex
dancing
it
down
drinking
it
down
laughing
it
down
burning
it
out
in
tobacco
fumes
drowning
it
in
trembling
cascades
of
wine
trampling
it
to
dust
under
the
cancan
by
her
little
boots
mocking
it
away
with
her
slang
jests
and
her
theresa
songs
and
her
audacities
till
there
was
scarce
a
trace
of
it
left
in
this
prettiest
and
wildest
little
scamp
of
all
the
army
in
africa
but
strive
to
kill
it
how
she
would
her
sex
would
have
its
revenge
one
day
and
play
nemesis
to
her
she
was
bewitching
now
bewitching
though
she
had
no
witchery
for
him
in
her
youth
but
when
the
bloom
should
leave
her
brown
cheeks
and
the
laughter
die
out
of
her
lightning
glance
the
womanhood
she
had
denied
would
assert
itself
and
avenge
itself
and
be
hideous
in
the
sight
of
the
men
who
now
loved
the
tinkling
of
those
little
spurred
feet
and
shouted
with
applause
to
hear
the
reckless
barrack
blasphemies
ring
their
mirth
from
the
fresh
mouth
which
was
now
like
a
bud
from
a
damask
rose
branch
though
even
now
it
steeped
itself
in
wine
and
sullied
itself
with
oaths
and
seared
itself
with
smoke
and
had
never
been
touched
from
its
infancy
with
any
kiss
that
was
innocent
not
even
with
its
mother
and
there
was
a
deep
tinge
of
pity
for
her
in
cecil
thoughts
as
he
watched
her
out
of
sight
and
then
strolled
across
to
the
cafe
opposite
to
finish
his
cigar
beneath
its
awning
the
child
had
been
flung
upward
a
little
straw
floating
in
the
gutter
of
paris
iniquities
it
was
little
marvel
that
the
bright
bold
insolent
little
friend
of
the
flag
had
nothing
of
her
sex
left
save
a
kitten
mischief
and
a
coquette
archness
it
said
much
rather
for
the
straight
fair
sunlit
instincts
of
the
untaught
nature
that
cigarette
had
gleaned
even
out
of
such
a
life
two
virtues
that
she
would
have
held
by
to
the
death
if
tried
a
truthfulness
that
would
have
scorned
a
lie
as
only
fit
for
cowards
and
a
loyalty
that
cleaved
to
france
as
a
religion
cecil
thought
that
a
gallant
boy
was
spoiled
in
this
brunette
of
a
campaigner
he
might
have
gone
further
and
said
that
a
hero
was
lost
voila
said
cigarette
between
her
little
teeth
she
stood
in
the
glittering
algerine
night
brilliant
with
a
million
stars
and
balmy
with
a
million
flowers
before
the
bronze
trellised
gate
of
the
villa
on
the
sahel
where
chateauroy
when
he
was
not
on
active
service
which
chanced
rarely
for
he
was
one
of
the
finest
soldiers
and
most
daring
chiefs
in
africa
indemnified
himself
with
the
magnificence
that
his
private
fortune
enabled
him
to
enjoy
for
the
unsparing
exertions
and
the
rugged
privations
that
he
always
shared
willingly
with
the
lowest
of
his
soldiers
it
was
the
grandest
trait
in
the
man
character
that
he
utterly
scorned
the
effeminacy
with
which
many
commanders
provided
for
their
table
their
comfort
and
their
gratification
while
campaigning
and
would
commonly
neither
take
himself
nor
allow
to
his
officers
any
more
indulgence
on
the
march
than
his
troopers
themselves
enjoyed
but
his
villa
on
the
sahel
was
a
miniature
palace
it
had
formerly
been
the
harem
of
a
great
rais
and
the
gardens
were
as
enchanting
as
the
interior
was
if
something
florid
still
as
elegant
as
paris
art
and
paris
luxury
could
make
it
for
ferocious
as
the
black
hawk
was
in
war
and
well
as
he
loved
the
chase
and
the
slaughter
he
did
not
disdain
when
he
had
whetted
beak
and
talons
to
satiety
to
smooth
his
ruffled
plumage
in
downy
nests
and
under
caressing
hands
the
windows
of
the
pretty
low
building
were
lighted
and
open
and
through
the
wilderness
of
cactus
myrtle
orange
citron
fuchsia
and
a
thousand
flowers
that
almost
buried
it
under
their
weight
of
leaf
and
blossom
a
myriad
of
lamps
were
gleaming
like
so
many
glowworms
beneath
the
foliage
while
from
a
cedar
grove
some
slight
way
farther
out
the
melodies
and
overtures
of
the
best
military
bands
in
algiers
came
mellowed
though
not
broken
by
the
distance
and
the
fall
of
the
bubbling
fountains
cigarette
looked
and
listened
and
her
gay
brown
face
grew
duskily
warm
with
wrath
ah
bah
she
muttered
as
she
pressed
her
pretty
lips
to
the
the
men
die
like
sheep
in
the
hospital
and
get
sour
bread
tossed
to
them
as
if
they
were
pigs
and
are
thrashed
if
they
pawn
their
muskets
for
a
stoup
of
drink
when
their
throats
are
as
dry
as
the
desert
and
you
live
in
clover
marbleu
cigarette
was
a
resolute
little
democrat
she
had
loaded
the
carbines
behind
the
barricade
in
paris
before
she
was
ten
years
old
and
was
not
seldom
in
the
perplexity
of
conflicting
creeds
when
her
loyalty
to
the
tricolor
smote
with
a
violent
clash
on
her
love
for
the
populace
and
their
liberty
she
looked
a
moment
longer
through
the
gilded
then
as
she
had
done
once
before
thrust
her
pistols
well
within
her
sash
that
they
should
not
catch
upon
the
boughs
and
pushing
herself
through
the
prickly
cactus
hedge
impervious
to
anything
save
herself
or
a
barbary
marmoset
twisted
with
marvelous
ingenuity
through
the
leaves
and
the
close
barriers
of
spines
and
launched
herself
with
inimitable
dexterity
on
to
the
other
side
of
the
cacti
cigarette
had
too
often
played
a
game
at
spying
and
reconnoitering
for
her
regiments
and
played
it
with
a
cleverness
that
distanced
even
the
most
ruse
of
the
zephyrs
not
to
be
able
to
do
just
whatever
she
chose
in
taking
the
way
she
liked
and
lurking
unseen
at
discretion
she
crossed
the
breadth
of
the
grounds
under
the
heavy
shade
of
arbutus
trees
with
a
hare
fleetness
and
stood
a
second
looking
at
the
open
windows
and
the
terraces
that
lay
before
them
brightly
lighted
by
the
summer
moon
and
by
the
lamps
that
sparkled
among
the
shrubs
then
down
she
dropped
as
quickly
as
lightly
as
a
young
setter
down
among
the
ferns
into
a
shower
of
rhododendrons
whose
rose
and
lilac
blossoms
shut
her
wholly
within
them
like
a
fairy
inclosed
in
bloom
the
good
fairy
of
one
life
there
she
was
assuredly
though
she
might
be
but
a
audacious
careless
little
feminine
belphegor
and
military
asmodeus
ah
she
said
quickly
and
sharply
with
a
breath
the
single
exclamation
was
at
once
a
menace
a
tenderness
a
whirlwind
of
rage
a
volume
of
disdain
a
world
of
pity
it
was
intensely
french
and
the
whole
nature
of
cigarette
was
in
it
yet
all
she
saw
was
a
small
and
brilliant
group
sauntering
to
and
fro
before
the
open
windows
after
dinner
listening
to
the
bands
which
through
dinner
had
played
to
them
and
laughing
low
and
softly
and
at
some
distance
from
them
beneath
the
shade
of
a
cedar
the
figure
of
a
corporal
of
chasseurs
calm
erect
motionless
as
though
he
were
the
figure
of
a
soldier
cast
in
bronze
the
scene
was
simple
enough
though
very
picturesque
but
it
told
by
its
vivid
force
of
contrast
a
whole
history
to
cigarette
a
true
soldier
she
muttered
where
she
lay
among
the
rhododendrons
while
her
eyes
grew
very
soft
as
she
gave
the
highest
word
of
praise
that
her
whole
range
of
language
held
a
true
soldier
how
he
keeps
his
promise
but
it
must
be
bitter
she
looked
a
while
very
wistfully
at
the
chasseur
where
he
stood
under
the
lebanon
boughs
then
her
glance
swept
bright
as
a
hawk
over
the
terrace
and
lighted
with
a
prescient
hatred
on
the
central
form
of
all
a
woman
there
were
two
other
great
ladies
there
but
she
passed
them
and
darted
with
unerring
instinct
on
that
proud
fair
patrician
head
with
its
haughty
carriage
and
the
crown
of
its
golden
hair
cigarette
had
seen
grand
dames
by
the
thousand
though
never
very
close
seen
them
in
paris
when
they
came
to
look
on
at
a
grand
review
seen
them
in
their
court
attire
when
the
guides
had
filled
the
carrousel
on
some
palace
and
lined
the
court
des
princes
and
she
had
bewitched
the
officers
of
the
guard
into
letting
her
pass
in
to
see
the
pageantry
but
she
had
never
felt
for
those
grandes
dames
anything
save
a
considerably
contemptuous
indifference
she
had
looked
on
them
pretty
much
as
a
veteran
looks
on
the
curled
dandy
of
some
fashionable
corps
she
had
never
realized
the
difference
betwixt
them
and
herself
save
in
so
far
as
she
thought
them
useless
butterflies
worth
nothing
at
all
and
laughed
as
she
triumphantly
remembered
how
she
could
shoot
a
man
and
break
in
a
colt
now
for
the
first
time
the
sight
of
one
of
those
aristocrats
smote
her
with
a
keen
hot
sting
of
jealousy
now
for
the
fist
time
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
looked
at
all
the
nameless
graces
of
rank
with
an
envy
that
her
sunny
gladsome
generous
nature
had
never
before
been
touched
with
with
a
sudden
perception
quick
as
thought
bitter
as
gall
wounding
and
swift
and
poignant
of
what
this
womanhood
that
he
had
said
she
herself
had
lost
might
be
in
its
highest
and
purest
shape
if
those
are
the
women
that
he
knew
before
he
came
here
i
do
not
wonder
that
he
never
cared
to
watch
even
my
bamboula
was
the
latent
unacknowledged
thought
that
was
so
cruel
to
her
the
consciousness
which
forced
itself
in
on
her
while
her
eyes
jealously
followed
the
perfect
grace
of
the
one
in
whom
instinct
had
found
her
rival
that
while
she
had
been
so
proud
of
her
recklessness
and
her
devilry
and
her
trooper
slang
and
her
deadly
skill
as
a
shot
she
had
only
been
something
very
worthless
something
very
lightly
held
by
those
who
liked
her
for
a
ribald
jest
and
a
dance
and
a
spahis
supper
of
headlong
riot
and
drunken
mirth
the
mood
did
not
last
she
was
too
brave
too
fiery
too
dauntless
too
untamed
the
dusky
angry
flush
upon
her
face
grew
deeper
and
the
passion
gathered
more
stormily
in
her
eyes
while
she
felt
the
pistol
butts
in
her
sash
and
laughed
low
to
herself
where
she
lay
stretched
under
her
flowery
nest
bah
she
would
faint
i
dare
say
at
the
mere
sight
of
these
she
thought
with
her
old
disdain
and
would
stand
fire
no
more
than
a
gazelle
they
are
only
made
for
weather
those
dainty
gorgeous
silver
pheasants
a
breath
of
war
a
touch
of
tempest
would
soon
beat
them
down
crash
with
all
their
proud
crests
drooping
like
many
another
cigarette
underrated
what
she
had
no
knowledge
of
and
depreciated
an
antagonist
the
measure
of
whose
fence
she
had
no
power
to
gauge
crouched
there
among
the
rhododendrons
she
lay
as
still
as
a
mouse
moving
nearer
and
nearer
though
none
would
have
told
that
so
much
as
a
lizard
even
stirred
under
the
blossoms
until
her
ear
quick
and
unerring
as
an
indian
could
detect
the
sense
of
the
words
spoken
by
that
group
which
so
aroused
all
the
hot
ire
of
her
warrior
soul
and
her
democrat
impatience
chateauroy
himself
was
bending
his
fine
dark
head
toward
the
patrician
on
whom
her
instinct
had
fastened
her
hatred
you
expressed
your
wish
to
see
my
corporal
little
sculptures
again
madame
he
was
murmuring
now
as
cigarette
got
close
enough
under
her
flower
shadows
to
catch
the
sense
of
the
words
to
hear
was
to
obey
with
me
he
waits
your
commands
cecil
obeyed
the
lackey
who
crossed
the
lawn
passed
up
the
stairs
and
stood
before
his
colonel
giving
the
salute
the
shade
of
some
acacias
still
fell
across
him
while
the
party
he
fronted
were
in
all
the
glow
of
a
full
algerian
moon
and
of
the
thousand
lamps
among
the
belt
of
flowers
and
trees
cigarette
gave
a
sharp
breath
and
lay
as
mute
and
motionless
as
she
had
done
before
then
among
the
rushes
of
some
dried
brook
bed
scanning
a
hostile
camp
when
the
fate
of
a
handful
of
french
troops
had
rested
on
her
surety
and
her
caution
chateauroy
spoke
with
a
carelessness
as
of
a
man
to
a
dog
turning
to
his
corporal
victor
mme
la
princesse
honors
you
with
the
desire
to
see
your
toys
again
spread
them
the
savage
authority
of
his
general
speech
was
softened
for
sake
of
his
guest
presence
but
there
was
a
covert
tone
in
the
words
that
made
cigarette
murmur
to
herself
if
he
forget
his
promise
i
will
forgive
him

had
not
forgotten
it
neither
had
he
forgotten
the
lesson
that
this
fair
aristocrate
had
read
him
in
the
morning
he
saluted
his
chief
again
set
the
chessbox
down
upon
the
ledge
of
the
marble
balustrade
and
stood
silent
without
once
glancing
at
the
fair
and
haughty
face
that
was
more
brilliant
still
in
the
african
starlight
than
it
had
been
in
the
noon
sun
of
the
chasseurs
chambree
courtesy
was
forbidden
him
as
insult
from
a
corporal
to
a
nobly
born
beauty
he
no
more
quarreled
with
the
decree
than
with
other
inevitable
consequences
inevitable
degradations
that
followed
on
his
entrance
as
a
private
under
the
french
flag
he
had
been
used
to
the
impassable
demarcations
of
caste
he
did
not
dispute
them
more
now
that
he
was
without
than
he
had
done
when
within
their
magic
pale
the
carvings
were
passed
from
hand
to
hand
as
the
marquis
six
or
eight
guests
listless
willing
to
be
amused
in
the
warmth
of
the
evening
after
their
dinner
occupied
themselves
with
the
ivory
chess
armies
cut
with
a
skill
and
a
finish
worthy
a
roman
studio
praise
enough
was
awarded
to
the
art
but
none
of
them
remembered
the
artist
who
stood
apart
grave
calm
with
a
certain
serene
dignity
that
could
not
be
degraded
because
others
chose
to
treat
him
as
the
station
he
filled
gave
them
fit
right
to
do
only
one
glanced
at
him
with
a
touch
of
wondering
pity
softening
her
pride
she
who
had
rejected
the
gift
of
those
mimic
squadrons
you
were
surely
a
sculptor
once
she
asked
him
with
that
graceful
distant
kindness
which
she
might
have
shown
some
arab
outcast
never
indeed
then
who
taught
you
such
exquisite
art
it
can
not
claim
to
be
called
art
she
looked
at
him
with
an
increased
interest
the
accent
of
his
voice
told
her
that
this
man
whatever
he
might
be
now
had
once
been
a
gentleman
oh
yes
it
is
perfect
of
its
kind
who
was
your
master
in
it
a
common
teacher
madame
there
was
a
very
sweet
gleam
of
compassion
in
the
luster
of
her
dark
dreaming
eyes
does
necessity
often
teach
so
well
in
the
ranks
of
our
army
madame
i
think
it
does
often
indeed
much
chateauroy
had
stood
by
and
heard
with
as
much
impatience
as
he
cared
to
show
before
guests
whose
rank
was
precious
to
the
man
who
had
still
weakness
enough
to
be
ashamed
that
his
father
brave
and
famous
life
had
first
been
cradled
under
the
thatch
roof
of
a
little
victor
knows
that
neither
he
nor
his
men
have
any
right
to
waste
their
time
on
such
trash
he
said
carelessly
but
the
truth
is
they
love
the
canteen
so
well
that
they
will
do
anything
to
add
enough
to
their
pay
to
buy
she
whom
he
had
called
mme
la
princesse
looked
with
a
doubting
surprise
at
the
sculptor
of
the
white
arab
king
she
held
that
man
does
not
carve
for
brandy
she
thought
it
must
be
a
solace
to
many
a
weary
hour
in
the
barracks
to
be
able
to
produce
such
beautiful
trifles
as
these
she
said
aloud
surely
you
encourage
such
pursuits
monsieur
not
i
said
chateauroy
with
a
dash
of
his
camp
tone
that
he
could
not
withhold
there
are
but
two
arts
or
virtues
for
a
trooper
to
my
taste
fighting
and
you
should
be
in
the
russian
service
de
chateauroy
said
the
lady
with
a
smile
that
slight
as
it
was
made
the
marquis
eyes
flash
fire
almost
i
wish
i
had
been
he
answered
her
men
are
made
to
keep
their
grades
there
and
privates
who
think
themselves
fine
gentlemen
receive
the
lash
they
how
he
hates
his
corporal
she
thought
while
she
laid
aside
the
white
king
once
more
nay
interposed
chateauroy
recovering
his
momentary
since
you
like
the
bagatelles
do
me
honor
enough
to
keep
oh
no
i
offered
your
soldier
his
own
price
for
them
this
morning
and
he
refused
chateauroy
swung
round
ah
you
dared
refuse
your
bits
of
ivory
when
you
were
honored
by
an
offer
for
them
cecil
stood
silent
his
eyes
met
his
chief
steadily
chateauroy
had
seen
that
look
when
his
chasseur
had
bearded
him
in
the
solitude
of
his
tent
and
demanded
back
the
pearl
of
the
desert
the
princesse
glanced
at
both
then
she
stooped
her
elegant
head
slightly
to
the
marquis
do
not
blame
your
corporal
unjustly
through
me
i
pray
you
he
refused
any
price
but
he
offered
them
to
me
very
gracefully
as
a
gift
though
of
course
it
was
not
possible
that
i
should
accept
them
the
man
is
the
most
insolent
in
the
service
muttered
her
host
as
he
motioned
cecil
back
off
the
terrace
get
you
gone
sir
and
leave
your
toys
here
or
i
will
have
them
broken
up
by
a
the
words
were
low
that
they
should
not
offend
the
ears
of
the
great
ladies
who
were
his
listeners
but
they
were
coarsely
savage
in
their
whispered
command
and
the
princesse
heard
them
he
has
brought
his
chasseur
here
only
to
humiliate
him
she
thought
with
the
same
thought
that
flashed
through
the
mind
of
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
where
she
hid
among
her
rhododendrons
now
the
dainty
aristocrate
was
very
proud
but
she
was
not
so
proud
but
that
justice
was
stronger
in
her
than
pride
and
a
noble
generous
temper
mellowed
the
somewhat
too
cold
and
languid
negligence
of
one
of
the
fairest
and
haughtiest
women
that
ever
adorned
a
court
she
was
too
generous
not
to
rescue
anyone
who
suffered
through
her
the
slightest
injustice
not
to
interfere
when
through
her
any
misconception
lighted
on
another
she
saw
with
her
rapid
perception
and
sympathy
that
the
man
whom
chateauroy
addressed
with
the
brutal
insolence
of
a
bully
to
his
disobedient
dog
had
once
been
a
gentlemen
though
he
now
held
but
the
rank
of
a
in
the
algerian
cavalry
and
she
saw
that
he
suffered
all
the
more
keenly
under
an
outrage
he
had
no
power
to
resist
because
of
that
enforced
serenity
that
dignity
of
silence
and
of
patience
with
which
he
stood
before
his
tyrant
wait
she
said
moving
a
little
toward
them
while
she
let
her
eyes
rest
on
the
carver
of
the
sculptures
with
a
grave
compassion
though
she
addressed
his
chief
you
wholly
mistake
me
i
laid
no
blame
whatever
on
your
corporal
let
him
take
the
chessmen
back
with
him
i
would
on
no
account
rob
him
of
them
i
can
well
understand
that
he
does
not
care
to
part
with
such
masterpieces
of
his
art
and
that
he
would
not
appraise
them
by
their
worth
in
gold
only
shows
that
he
is
a
true
artist
as
doubtless
also
he
is
a
true
the
words
were
spoken
with
a
gracious
courtesy
the
clear
cold
tone
of
her
habitual
manner
just
marking
in
them
still
the
difference
of
caste
between
her
and
the
man
for
whom
she
interceded
as
she
would
equally
have
interceded
for
a
dog
who
should
have
been
threatened
with
the
lash
because
he
had
displeased
her
that
very
tone
struck
a
sharper
blow
to
cecil
than
the
insolence
of
his
commander
had
power
to
deal
him
his
face
flushed
a
little
he
lifted
his
cap
to
her
with
a
grave
reverence
and
moved
away
i
thank
you
madame
keep
them
if
you
will
so
far
honor
the
words
reached
only
her
ear
in
another
instant
he
had
passed
away
down
the
terrace
steps
obedient
to
his
chief
dismissal
ah
have
no
kind
scruples
in
keeping
them
madame
chateauroy
laughed
to
her
as
she
still
held
in
her
hand
doubtfully
the
white
sheik
of
the
chess
arabs
i
will
see
that
as
they
call
him
does
not
suffer
by
losing
these
trumperies
which
i
believe
old
a
veteran
of
ours
and
a
wonderful
carver
had
really
far
more
to
do
with
producing
than
he
you
must
not
let
your
gracious
pity
be
moved
by
such
fellows
as
these
troopers
of
mine
they
are
the
most
ingenious
rascals
in
the
world
and
know
as
well
how
to
produce
a
dramatic
effect
in
your
presence
as
they
do
how
to
drink
and
to
swear
when
they
are
out
of
very
possibly
she
said
with
an
indolent
indifference
but
that
man
was
no
actor
and
i
never
saw
a
gentleman
if
he
have
not
been
like
enough
answered
the
marquis
i
believe
many
come
into
our
ranks
who
have
fled
their
native
countries
and
broken
all
laws
from
the
decalogue
to
the
code
napoleon
so
long
as
they
fight
well
we
do
ask
their
past
criminalities
we
can
not
afford
to
throw
away
a
good
soldier
because
he
has
made
his
own
land
too
hot
to
hold
of
what
country
is
your
corporal
then
i
have
not
an
idea
i
imagine
his
past
must
have
been
something
very
black
indeed
for
the
slightest
trace
of
it
has
never
that
i
know
of
been
allowed
to
let
slip
from
him
he
encourages
the
men
in
every
insubordination
buys
their
favor
with
every
sort
of
stage
trick
thinks
himself
the
finest
gentleman
in
the
whole
brigades
of
africa
and
ought
to
have
been
shot
long
ago
if
he
had
had
his
real
she
let
her
glance
dwell
on
him
with
a
contemplation
that
was
half
contemptuous
amusement
half
unexpressed
dissent
i
wonder
he
has
not
been
since
you
have
the
ruling
of
his
fate
she
said
with
a
slight
smile
lingering
about
the
proud
rich
softness
of
her
lips
so
do
there
was
a
gaunt
grim
stern
significance
in
the
three
monosyllables
that
escaped
him
unconsciously
it
made
her
turn
and
look
at
him
more
closely
how
has
he
offended
you
she
asked
chateauroy
laughed
off
her
question
in
a
thousand
ways
madame
chiefly
because
i
received
my
regimental
training
under
one
who
followed
the
traditions
of
the
armies
of
egypt
and
the
rhine
and
have
i
confess
little
tolerance
in
consequence
of
a
rebel
who
plays
the
martyr
and
a
soldier
who
is
too
effeminate
an
idler
to
do
anything
except
attitudinize
in
interesting
situations
to
awaken
she
listened
with
something
of
distaste
upon
her
face
where
she
still
leaned
against
the
marble
balustrade
toying
with
the
ivory
bedouins
i
am
not
much
interested
in
military
discussion
she
said
coldly
but
i
imagine
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
so
that
you
do
your
corporal
some
little
injustice
here
i
should
not
fancy
he
anything
to
judge
from
the
very
good
tone
of
his
manners
for
the
rest
i
shall
not
keep
the
chessmen
without
making
him
fitting
payment
for
them
since
he
declines
money
you
will
tell
me
what
form
that
had
better
take
to
be
of
real
and
welcome
service
to
a
chasseur
chateauroy
more
incensed
than
he
chose
or
dared
to
show
bowed
courteously
but
with
a
grim
ironic
smile
if
you
really
insist
give
him
a
napoleon
or
two
whenever
you
see
him
he
will
be
very
happy
to
take
it
and
spend
it
au
cabaret
though
he
played
the
aristocrat
but
you
are
too
good
to
him
he
is
one
of
the
very
worst
of
my
pratiques
and
you
are
as
cruel
to
me
in
refusing
to
deign
to
accept
my
trooper
worthless
bagatelles
at
my
she
bent
her
superb
head
silently
whether
in
acquiescence
or
rejection
he
could
not
well
resolve
with
himself
and
turned
to
the
staff
officers
among
them
the
heir
of
a
princely
french
house
who
surrounded
her
and
sorely
begrudged
the
moments
she
had
given
to
those
miniature
carvings
and
the
private
soldier
who
had
wrought
them
she
was
no
coquette
she
was
of
too
imperial
a
nature
had
too
lofty
a
pride
and
was
too
difficult
to
charm
or
to
enchain
but
those
meditative
brilliant
serene
eyes
had
a
terrible
gift
of
awakening
without
ever
seeking
love
and
of
drawing
without
ever
recompensing
homage
crouched
down
among
her
covert
cigarette
had
watched
and
heard
her
teeth
set
tightly
her
breath
coming
and
going
swiftly
her
hand
clinched
close
on
the
butts
of
her
pistols
fiery
curses
with
all
the
infinite
variety
in
cursing
of
a
barrack
repertoire
chasing
one
another
in
hot
fast
mutterings
of
those
bright
lips
that
should
have
known
nothing
except
a
child
careless
and
innocent
song
she
had
never
looked
at
a
beautiful
woman
before
holding
them
in
gay
satirical
disdain
as
mere
butterflies
who
could
not
prime
a
revolver
and
fire
it
off
to
save
their
own
lives
if
ever
such
need
arose
but
now
she
studied
one
through
all
the
fine
quickened
unerring
instincts
of
jealousy
and
there
is
no
instinct
in
the
world
that
gives
such
thorough
appreciation
of
the
very
rival
it
reviles
she
saw
the
courtly
negligence
the
regal
grace
the
fair
brilliant
loveliness
the
delicious
serene
languor
of
a
pure
aristocrate
for
the
very
first
time
to
note
them
and
they
made
her
heart
sick
with
a
new
and
deadly
sense
they
moved
her
much
as
the
white
delicate
carvings
of
the
had
done
they
like
the
carvings
showed
her
all
she
had
missed
she
dropped
her
head
suddenly
like
a
wounded
bird
and
the
racy
vindictive
camp
oaths
died
off
her
lips
she
thought
of
herself
as
she
had
danced
that
mad
bacchic
bamboula
amid
the
crowd
of
shouting
stamping
drunken
soldiery
and
for
the
moment
she
hated
herself
more
even
than
she
hated
that
patrician
yonder
i
know
what
he
meant
now
she
pondered
and
her
spirited
sparkling
brunette
face
was
dark
and
weary
like
a
brown
brook
over
whose
radiance
the
heavy
shadow
of
some
eagle
wings
hovers
hiding
the
sun
she
looked
once
twice
thrice
more
inquiringly
envyingly
thirstily
then
as
the
band
under
the
cedars
rolled
out
their
music
afresh
and
light
laughter
echoed
to
her
from
the
terrace
she
turned
and
wound
herself
back
under
the
cover
of
the
shrubs
not
joyously
and
mischievously
as
she
had
come
but
almost
as
slowly
almost
as
sadly
as
a
hare
that
the
greyhounds
have
coursed
drags
itself
through
the
grasses
and
ferns
once
through
the
cactus
hedge
her
old
spirit
returned
she
shook
herself
angrily
with
petulant
she
swore
a
little
and
felt
that
the
fierce
familiar
words
did
her
good
like
brandy
poured
down
her
throat
she
tossed
her
head
like
a
colt
that
rebels
against
the
gall
of
the
curb
then
fleet
as
a
fawn
she
dashed
down
the
moonlit
road
at
topmost
speed
she
ca
do
what
i
do
she
thought
and
she
ran
the
faster
and
sang
a
of
the
spahis
all
the
louder
because
still
at
her
heart
a
dull
pain
was
aching
chapter

cigarette
always
went
fast
she
had
a
way
of
skimming
her
ground
that
took
her
over
it
with
wonderful
swiftness
all
the
tassels
and
ribbon
knots
and
sashes
with
which
her
uniform
was
rendered
so
gay
and
so
distinctive
fluttering
behind
her
and
her
little
military
boots
with
the
bright
spurs
twinkling
flying
over
the
earth
too
lightly
for
a
speck
of
dust
though
it
lay
thick
as
august
suns
could
parch
it
to
rest
upon
her
thus
she
went
now
along
the
lovely
moonlight
singing
her
drinking
song
so
fast
and
so
loud
that
had
it
been
any
other
than
this
young
of
the
african
squadrons
it
might
have
been
supposed
she
sang
out
of
fear
and
bravado
two
things
however
that
never
touched

for
she
exulted
in
danger
as
friskily
as
a
young
salmon
exults
in
the

crisp
tumbling
crest
of

would
have
backed
up
the
most
vainglorious
word
she
could
have
spoken
with
the
cost
of
her
life
had
need
been
suddenly
as
she
went
she
heard
a
shout
on
the
still
night
air
very
still
now
that
the
lights
and
the
melodies
and
the
laughter
of
chateauroy
villa
lay
far
behind
and
the
town
of
algiers
was
yet
distant
with
its
lamps
glittering
down
by
the
sea
the
shout
was
a
moi
roumis
pour
la
france
and
cigarette
knew
the
voice
ringing
melodiously
and
calm
still
though
it
gave
the
sound
of
alarm
cigarette
au
secour
she
cried
in
answer
she
had
cried
it
many
a
time
over
the
heat
of
battlefields
and
when
the
wounded
men
in
the
dead
of
the
sickly
night
writhed
under
the
knife
of
the
if
she
had
gone
like
the
wind
before
she
went
like
the
lightning
now
a
few
yards
onward
she
saw
a
confused
knot
of
horses
and
of
riders
struggling
one
with
another
in
a
cloud
of
white
dust
silvery
and
hazy
in
the
radiance
of
the
moon
the
center
figure
was
cecil
the
four
others
were
arabs
armed
to
the
teeth
and
mad
with
drink
who
had
spent
the
whole
day
in
drunken
debauchery
pouring
in
raki
down
their
throats
until
they
were
wild
with
its
poisonous
fire
and
had
darted
headlong
all
abreast
down
out
of
the
town
overriding
all
that
came
in
their
way
and
lashing
their
poor
beasts
with
their
sabers
till
the
horses
flanks
ran
blood
just
as
they
neared
cecil
they
had
knocked
aside
and
trampled
over
a
worn
out
old
colon
of
age
too
feeble
for
him
to
totter
in
time
from
their
path
cecil
had
reined
up
and
shouted
to
them
to
pause
they
inflamed
with
the
perilous
drink
and
senseless
with
the
fury
which
seems
to
possess
every
arab
once
started
in
a
race
were
too
blind
to
see
and
too
furious
to
care
that
they
were
faced
by
a
soldier
of
france
but
rode
down
on
him
at
once
with
their
curled
sabers
flashing
round
their
heads
his
horse
stood
the
shock
gallantly
and
he
sought
at
first
only
to
parry
their
thrusts
and
to
cut
through
their
stallions
reins
but
the
latter
were
chain
bridles
and
only
notched
his
sword
as
the
blade
struck
them
and
the
former
became
too
numerous
and
too
savagely
dealt
to
be
easily
played
with
in
carte
and
tierce
the
arabs
were
he
saw
at
a
glance
and
had
got
the
upon
them
roused
and
burning
with
brandy
and
raki
these
men
were
like
tigers
to
deal
with
the
words
he
had
spoken
they
never
heard
and
their
horses
hemmed
him
in
powerless
while
their
steel
flashed
on
every
side
they
were
not
of
the
tribe
of
khalifa
if
he
struck
not
and
struck
not
surely
he
saw
that
a
few
moments
more
of
that
moonlight
night
were
all
that
he
would
live
he
wished
to
avoid
bloodshed
both
because
his
sympathies
were
always
with
the
conquered
tribes
and
because
he
knew
that
every
one
of
these
quarrels
and
combats
between
the
vanquisher
and
the
vanquished
served
further
to
widen
the
breach
already
broad
enough
between
them
but
it
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
choice
with
him
as
his
shoulder
was
grazed
by
a
thrust
which
but
for
a
swerve
of
his
horse
would
have
pierced
to
his
lungs
and
the
four
riders
yelling
like
madmen
forced
the
animal
back
on
his
haunches
and
assaulted
him
with
breathless
violence
he
swept
his
own
arm
back
and
brought
his
saber
down
straight
through
the
of
the
foremost
the
limb
was
cleft
through
as
if
the
stroke
of
an
ax
had
severed
it
and
thrice
infuriated
the
arabs
closed
in
on
him
the
points
of
their
weapons
were
piercing
his
harness
when
sharp
and
swift
one
on
another
three
shots
hissed
past
him
the
nearest
of
his
assailants
fell
stone
dead
and
the
others
wounded
and
startled
loosed
their
hold
shook
their
reins
and
tore
off
down
the
lonely
road
while
the
dead
man
horse
shaking
his
burden
from
him
out
of
the
stirrups
followed
them
at
a
headlong
gallop
through
a
cloud
of
dust
that
was
a
pretty
cut
through
the
arm
better
had
it
been
through
the
throat
never
do
things
by
halves
ami
victor
said
cigarette
carelessly
as
she
thrust
her
pistols
back
into
her
sash
and
looked
with
the
tranquil
appreciation
of
a
connoisseur
on
the
brown
brawny
naked
limb
where
it
lay
severed
on
the
sand
with
the
hilt
of
the
weapon
still
hanging
in
the
sinewy
fingers
cecil
threw
himself
from
his
saddle
and
gazed
at
her
in
bewildered
amazement
he
had
thought
those
sure
cool
shots
had
come
from
some
spahi
or
chasseur
i
owe
you
my
life
he
said
rapidly
but
good
god
you
have
shot
the
fellow
dead
cigarette
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
contemptuous
glance
at
the
bedouin
corpse
to
be
sure
i
am
not
a
happily
for
me
or
i
had
been
where
he
lies
now
but
wait
let
me
look
there
may
be
breath
in
him
cigarette
laughed
offended
and
scornful
as
with
the
offense
and
scorn
of
one
whose
first
science
was
impeached
look
and
welcome
but
if
you
find
any
life
in
that
arab
make
a
laugh
of
it
before
all
the
army
she
was
at
her
fiercest
a
thousand
new
emotions
had
been
roused
in
her
that
night
bringing
pain
with
them
that
she
bitterly
resented
and
moreover
this
child
of
the
army
of
africa
caught
fire
at
the
flame
of
battle
with
instant
contagion
and
had
seen
slaughter
around
her
from
her
first
infancy
cecil
disregarding
her
protest
stooped
and
raised
the
fallen
bedouin
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
was
right
the
lean
dark
lustful
face
was
set
in
the
rigidity
of
death
the
bullet
had
passed
straight
through
the
temples
did
you
never
see
a
dead
man
before
demanded
cigarette
impatiently
as
he
lingered
even
in
this
moment
he
had
more
thought
of
this
arab
than
he
had
of
her
he
laid
the
arab
body
gently
down
and
looked
at
her
with
a
glance
that
rightly
or
wrongly
she
thought
had
a
rebuke
in
it
very
many
but
it
is
never
a
pleasant
sight
and
they
were
in
drink
they
did
not
know
what
they
pardieu
what
divine
pity
good
powder
and
ball
were
sore
wasted
it
seems
you
would
have
preferred
to
lie
there
yourself
it
appears
i
beg
your
pardon
for
interfering
with
the
her
eyes
were
flashing
her
lips
very
scornful
and
wrathful
this
was
his
gratitude
wait
wait
said
cecil
rapidly
laying
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
as
she
flung
herself
away
my
dear
child
do
not
think
me
ungrateful
i
know
well
enough
i
should
be
a
dead
man
myself
had
it
not
been
for
your
gallant
assistance
believe
me
i
thank
you
from
my
but
you
think
me
all
the
same
i
see
beau
lion
the
word
had
rankled
in
her
she
could
launch
it
now
with
telling
reprisal
he
smiled
but
he
saw
that
this
phrase
which
she
had
overheard
had
not
alone
incensed
but
had
wounded
her
well
a
little
perhaps
he
said
gently
how
should
it
be
otherwise
and
for
that
matter
i
have
seen
many
a
great
lady
look
on
and
laugh
her
soft
cruel
laughter
while
the
pheasants
were
falling
by
hundreds
or
the
stags
being
torn
by
the
hounds
they
called
it
but
there
was
not
much
difference
in
the
mercy
of
it
at
least
from
your
war
and
they
had
not
a
tithe
of
your
the
answer
failed
to
conciliate
her
there
was
an
accent
of
compassion
in
it
that
her
pride
and
a
lack
of
admiration
that
was
not
less
new
and
unwelcome
it
was
well
for
you
that
i
was
unsexed
enough
to
be
able
to
send
an
ounce
of
lead
into
a
drunkard
she
pursued
with
immeasurable
disdain
if
i
had
been
like
that
dainty
aristocrate
down
there
pardieu
it
had
been
worse
for
you
i
should
have
screamed
and
fainted
and
left
you
to
be
killed
while
i
made
a
tableau
oh
ha
that
is
to
be
is
it
not
where
did
you
see
that
lady
he
asked
in
some
surprise
oh
i
was
there
answered
cigarette
with
a
toss
of
her
head
southward
to
where
the
villa
lay
i
went
to
see
how
you
would
keep
your
well
you
saw
i
kept
she
gave
her
little
teeth
a
sharp
click
like
the
click
of
a
trigger
yes
and
i
would
have
forgiven
you
if
you
had
broken
would
you
i
should
not
have
forgiven
ah
you
are
just
like
the
marquise
and
you
will
end
like
very
she
knitted
her
pretty
brows
standing
there
in
his
path
with
her
pistols
thrust
in
her
sash
and
her
hands
resting
lightly
on
her
hips
as
a
good
workman
rests
after
a
neatly
finished
job
and
her
dainty
fez
set
half
on
one
side
of
her
brown
tangled
curls
while
upon
them
the
intense
luster
of
the
moonlight
streamed
and
in
the
dust
at
their
feet
lay
the
gaunt
form
of
the
dead
arab
with
the
olive
saturnine
face
turned
upward
to
the
stars
why
did
you
give
the
chessmen
to
that
silver
pheasant
she
asked
him
abruptly
silver
pheasant
yes
see
how
she
sweeps
sweeps
sweeps
so
languid
so
brilliant
so
useless
bah
why
did
you
give
them
she
admired
them
it
was
not
much
to
you
would
not
have
given
them
to
a
daughter
of
the
why
not
why
not
oh
ha
because
her
hands
would
be
hard
and
brown
and
coarse
not
fit
for
those
ivory
puppets
but
hers
are
white
like
the
ivory
and
can
not
soil
it
she
will
handle
them
so
gracefully
for
five
minutes
and
then
buy
a
new
toy
and
let
her
lapdog
break
yours
like
he
said
it
with
his
habitual
gentle
temper
but
there
was
a
shadow
of
pain
in
the
words
the
chessmen
had
become
in
some
sort
like
living
things
to
him
through
long
association
he
had
parted
from
them
not
without
regret
though
for
the
moment
courtesy
and
generosity
of
instinct
had
overcome
it
and
he
knew
that
it
was
but
too
true
how
in
all
likelihood
these
trifles
of
his
art
that
had
brought
him
many
a
solace
and
been
his
companion
through
many
a
lonely
hour
would
be
forgotten
by
the
morrow
where
he
had
bestowed
them
and
at
best
put
aside
in
a
cabinet
to
lie
unnoticed
among
bronzes
or
porcelain
or
be
set
on
some
boudoir
table
to
be
idled
with
in
the
mimic
warfare
that
would
serve
to
cover
some
listless
flirtation
cigarette
quick
to
sting
but
as
quick
to
repent
using
her
sting
saw
the
regret
in
him
with
the
rapid
uncalculating
liberality
of
an
utterly
unselfish
and
intensely
impulsive
nature
she
hastened
to
make
amends
by
saying
what
was
like
gall
on
her
tongue
in
the
utterance
tiens
she
said
quickly
perhaps
she
will
value
them
more
than
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
aristocrats
not
i
when
you
were
gone
she
championed
you
against
the
black
hawk
she
told
him
that
if
you
had
not
been
a
gentleman
before
you
came
into
the
ranks
she
had
never
seen
one
she
spoke
well
if
you
had
but
heard
she
did
she
saw
his
glance
brighten
as
it
turned
on
her
in
a
surprised
gratification
well
what
is
there
so
wonderful
cigarette
asked
it
with
a
certain
petulance
and
doggedness
taking
a
namesake
out
of
her
biting
its
end
off
and
striking
a
fusee
a
word
from
this
aristocrate
was
more
welcome
to
him
than
a
bullet
that
had
saved
his
life
her
generosity
had
gone
very
far
and
like
most
generosity
got
nothing
for
its
pains
he
was
silent
a
few
moments
tracing
lines
in
the
dust
with
the
point
of
his
scabbard
cigarette
with
the
cigar
in
her
mouth
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
corporal
victor
are
you
going
to
dream
there
all
night
what
is
to
be
done
with
this
dog
of
an
arab
she
was
angered
by
him
she
was
in
the
mood
to
make
herself
seem
all
the
rougher
fiercer
naughtier
and
more
callous
she
had
shot
the
man
pouf
what
of
that
she
had
shot
men
before
as
all
africa
knew
she
would
defend
a
bird
a
terrified
sheep
a
old
cur
but
a
man
men
were
the
normal
and
natural
food
for
pistols
and
rifles
she
considered
a
state
of
society
in
which
firearms
had
been
unknown
was
a
thing
cigarette
had
never
heard
of
and
in
which
she
would
have
contumeliously
disbelieved
if
she
had
been
told
of
it
cecil
looked
up
from
his
musing
he
thought
what
a
pity
it
was
this
pretty
graceful
french
kitten
was
such
a
bloodthirsty
young
panther
at
heart
i
scarcely
know
what
to
do
he
answered
her
doubtfully
put
him
across
my
saddle
poor
wretch
i
suppose
the
fray
must
be
leave
that
to
me
said
cigarette
decidedly
and
with
a
certain
haughty
patronage
i
shot
him
i
will
see
the
thing
gets
told
right
it
might
be
awkward
for
you
they
are
growing
so
squeamish
about
the
roumis
killing
the
natives
draw
him
to
one
side
there
and
leave
him
the
crows
will
finish
his
the
coolness
with
which
this
handsome
child
disposed
of
the
fate
of
what
a
moment
or
two
before
had
been
a
sentient
breathing
vigorous
frame
sent
a
chill
through
her
hearer
though
he
had
been
seasoned
by
a
decade
of
slaughter
no
he
said
briefly
suspicion
might
fall
on
some
innocent
besides
he
shall
have
a
decent
burial
for
an
arab
pouf
cried
cigarette
in
derision
parbleu
i
have
seen
hundreds
of
our
best
soldiers
lie
rotting
on
the
plains
with
the
birds
beaks
at
their
eyes
and
the
jackals
fangs
in
their
flesh
what
was
good
enough
for
them
is
surely
good
enough
for
him
you
are
an
eccentric
fellow
you
he
laughed
a
little
time
was
when
i
should
have
begged
you
not
to
call
me
any
such
form
eccentric
i
have
not
genius
enough
for
eh
she
did
not
understand
him
well
you
want
that
carrion
poked
into
the
earth
instead
of
lying
atop
of
it
i
do
see
much
difference
myself
i
would
like
to
be
in
the
sun
as
long
as
i
could
i
think
dead
or
alive
ah
how
odd
it
is
to
think
one
will
be
dead
some
day
never
wake
for
the
reveille
never
hear
the
cannon
or
the
caissons
roll
by
never
stir
when
the
trumpets
sound
the
charge
but
lie
there
dead
dead
dead
while
the
squadrons
thunder
above
one
grave
droll
eh
a
momentary
pathos
softened
her
voice
where
she
stood
in
the
glistening
moonlight
that
the
time
would
ever
come
when
her
glad
laughter
would
be
hushed
when
her
young
heart
would
beat
no
more
when
the
bright
abundant
passionate
blood
would
bound
no
longer
through
her
veins
when
all
the
vivacious
vivid
sensuous
charms
of
living
would
be
ended
for
her
forever
was
a
thing
that
she
could
no
better
bring
home
to
her
than
a
bird
that
sings
in
the
light
of
the
sun
could
be
made
to
know
that
the
time
would
come
when
its
little
melodious
throat
would
be
frozen
in
death
and
give
song
never
more
the
tone
touched
him
made
him
think
less
and
less
of
her
as
a
boy
as
a
reckless
and
more
of
her
as
what
she
was
than
he
had
done
before
he
touched
her
almost
caressingly
pauvre
enfant
i
hope
that
day
will
be
very
distant
from
you
and
yet
how
bravely
you
risked
death
for
me
just
now
cigarette
though
accustomed
to
the
lawless
loves
of
the
camp
flushed
ever
so
slightly
at
the
mere
caress
of
his
hand
i
risked
nothing
she
said
rapidly
as
for
death
when
it
comes
it
comes
every
soldier
carries
it
in
his
wallet
and
it
may
jump
out
on
him
any
minute
i
would
rather
die
young
than
grow
old
age
is
nothing
else
but
death
that
is
where
do
you
get
your
wisdom
little
one
wisdom
bah
living
is
learning
some
people
go
through
life
with
their
eyes
shut
and
then
grumble
there
is
nothing
to
see
in
it
well
you
want
that
arab
buried
what
a
fancy
look
you
then
stay
by
him
since
you
are
so
fond
of
him
and
i
will
go
and
send
some
men
to
you
with
a
stretcher
to
carry
him
down
to
the
town
as
for
reporting
leave
that
to
me
i
shall
tell
them
i
left
you
on
guard
that
will
square
things
if
you
are
late
at
the
but
that
will
give
you
so
much
trouble
trouble
morbleu
do
you
think
i
am
like
that
silver
pheasant
yonder
lend
me
your
horse
and
i
shall
be
in
the
town
in
ten
minutes
she
vaulted
as
she
spoke
into
the
saddle
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
bridle
and
stopped
her
wait
i
have
not
thanked
you
half
enough
my
brave
little
champion
how
am
i
to
show
you
my
gratitude
for
a
moment
the
bright
brown
changeful
face
that
could
look
so
fiercely
scornful
so
sunnily
radiant
so
tempestuously
passionate
and
so
tenderly
childlike
in
almost
the
same
moment
grew
warm
as
the
warm
suns
that
had
given
their
fire
to
her
veins
she
glanced
at
him
almost
shyly
while
the
moonlight
slept
lustrously
in
the
dark
softness
of
her
eyes
there
was
an
intense
allurement
in
her
in
that
moment
the
allurement
of
a
woman
loveliness
bitterly
as
she
disdained
a
charms
it
might
have
told
him
more
plainly
than
words
how
best
he
could
reward
her
for
the
shot
that
had
saved
him
yet
though
a
man
on
whom
such
beguilement
usually
worked
only
too
easily
and
too
often
it
did
not
now
touch
him
he
was
grateful
to
her
but
despite
himself
he
was
cold
to
her
despite
himself
the
life
which
that
little
hand
that
he
held
had
taken
so
lightly
made
it
the
hand
of
a
comrade
to
be
grasped
in
alliance
but
never
the
hand
of
a
mistress
to
steal
to
his
lips
and
to
lie
in
his
breast
her
rapid
and
unerring
instinct
made
her
feel
that
keenly
and
instantly
she
had
seen
too
much
passion
not
to
know
when
it
was
absent
the
warmth
passed
off
her
face
her
teeth
clinched
she
shook
the
bridle
out
of
his
hold
take
gratitude
to
the
silver
pheasant
there
she
will
value
fine
words
i
set
no
count
on
them
i
did
no
more
for
you
than
i
have
done
scores
of
times
for
my
spahis
ask
them
how
many
i
have
shot
with
my
own
hand
in
another
instant
she
was
away
like
a
sirocco
a
whirlwind
of
dust
that
rose
in
the
moonlight
marking
her
flight
as
she
rode
full
gallop
to
algiers
a
kitten
with
the
tigress
in
her
thought
cecil
as
he
seated
himself
on
a
broken
pile
of
stone
to
keep
his
vigil
over
the
dead
arab
it
was
not
that
he
was
callous
to
the
generous
nature
of
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
or
that
he
was
insensible
either
to
the
courage
that
beat
so
dauntlessly
in
her
pulses
or
to
the
piquant
picturesque
grace
that
accompanied
even
her
wildest
actions
but
she
had
nothing
of
her
charm
for
him
he
thought
of
her
rather
as
a
young
soldier
than
as
a
young
girl
she
amused
him
as
a
wayward
bright
mischievous
audacious
boy
might
have
done
but
she
had
no
other
interest
for
him
he
had
given
her
little
attention
a
waltz
a
cigar
a
passing
jest
were
all
he
had
bestowed
on
the
little
lionne
of
the
spahis
corps
and
the
deepest
sentiment
she
had
ever
awakened
in
him
was
an
involuntary
pity
pity
for
this
flower
which
blossomed
on
the
polluted
field
of
war
and
under
the
branches
of
lawless
crime
a
flower
and
glancing
with
the
dews
of
youth
now
when
it
had
just
unclosed
in
all
its
earliest
beauty
but
already
soiled
and
tainted
by
the
bed
from
which
it
sprang
and
doomed
to
be
swept
away
with
time
scentless
and
loveless
down
the
rapid
noxious
current
of
that
broad
black
stream
of
vice
on
which
it
now
floated
so
heedlessly
even
now
his
thoughts
drifted
from
her
almost
before
the
sound
of
the
horse
hoofs
had
died
where
he
sat
on
a
loose
pile
of
stones
with
the
lifeless
limbs
of
the
arab
at
his
feet
who
was
it
in
my
old
life
that
she
is
like
he
was
musing
it
was
the
dreaming
haughty
eyes
of
the
princesse
that
he
was
bringing
back
to
memory
not
the
brown
mignon
face
that
had
been
so
late
close
to
his
in
the
light
of
the
moon
meanwhile
on
his
good
gray
cigarette
rode
like
a
true
chasseur
herself
she
was
used
to
the
saddle
and
would
ride
a
wild
desert
colt
without
stirrup
or
bridle
balancing
her
supple
form
now
on
one
foot
now
on
the
other
on
the
animal
naked
back
while
they
flew
at
full
speed
not
so
fantastically
but
full
as
speedily
she
dashed
down
into
the
city
scattering
all
she
met
with
right
and
left
till
she
rode
straight
up
to
the
barracks
of
the
chasseurs
at
the
entrance
as
she
reined
up
she
saw
the
very
person
she
wanted
and
signed
him
to
her
as
carelessly
as
if
he
were
a
conscript
instead
of
that
powerful
officer
francois
vireflau
captain
and
adjutant
hola
she
cried
as
she
signaled
him
cigarette
was
privileged
all
through
the
army
adjutant
vireflau
i
come
to
tell
you
a
good
story
for
your
folios
there
is
your
corporal
there
le
beau
victor
has
been
attacked
by
four
drunken
dogs
of
arbicos
and
four
against
one
he
fought
them
superbly
but
he
would
only
parry
not
thrust
because
he
knows
how
strict
the
rules
are
about
dealing
with
the
scoundrels
even
when
they
are
murdering
you
parbleu
he
has
behaved
splendidly
i
tell
you
so
and
he
was
so
patient
with
those
dogs
that
he
would
not
have
killed
one
of
them
but
i
did
shot
one
straight
through
the
brain
a
beautiful
thing
and
he
lies
on
the
oran
road
now
victor
would
not
leave
him
for
fear
some
should
be
thought
guilty
of
a
murder
so
i
came
on
to
tell
you
and
ask
you
to
send
some
men
up
for
the
jackal
body
ah
he
is
a
fine
soldier
that
of
yours
why
do
you
give
him
a
step
two
steps
three
steps
diantre
it
is
not
like
france
to
leave
him
a
corporal
vireflau
listened
attentively
a
short
lean
campaigner
who
yet
relaxed
into
a
grim
as
the
vivandiere
addressed
him
with
that
air
as
of
a
generalissimo
addressing
a
subordinate
which
always
characterized
cigarette
the
more
strongly
the
higher
the
grade
of
her
companion
or
opponent
always
eloquent
pretty
one
he
growled
are
you
sure
he
did
not
begin
the
fray
do
i
tell
you
the
four
arabs
were
like
four
devils
they
knocked
down
an
old
colon
and
tried
to
prevent
their
doing
more
mischief
and
they
set
on
him
like
so
many
he
kept
his
temper
wonderfully
he
always
tries
to
preserve
order
you
ca
say
so
much
of
your
captain
vireflau
commonly
here
this
is
his
horse
send
some
men
to
him
and
mind
the
thing
is
reported
fairly
and
to
his
credit
with
which
command
given
as
with
the
air
of
a
in
its
hauteur
and
its
nonchalance
cigarette
vaulted
off
the
charger
flung
the
bridle
to
a
soldier
and
was
away
and
out
of
sight
before
francois
vireflau
had
time
to
consider
whether
he
should
laugh
at
her
caprices
as
all
the
army
did
or
resent
her
insolence
to
his
dignity
but
he
was
a
man
and
what
was
better
a
just
one
and
cigarette
had
judged
rightly
that
the
tale
she
had
told
would
weigh
well
with
him
to
the
credit
side
of
his
corporal
and
would
not
reach
his
colonel
in
any
warped
version
that
could
give
pretext
for
any
fresh
exercise
of
tyranny
over
under
the
title
of
dieu
de
dieu
thought
his
champion
as
she
made
her
way
through
the
streets
i
swore
to
have
my
vengeance
on
him
it
is
a
droll
vengeance
to
save
his
life
and
plead
his
cause
with
vireflau
no
matter
one
could
not
look
on
and
let
a
set
of
arbicos
kill
a
good
lascar
of
france
and
the
thing
that
is
just
must
be
said
let
it
go
as
it
will
against
one
grain
public
welfare
before
private
pique
a
grand
and
misty
generality
which
consoled
cigarette
for
an
abandonment
of
her
sworn
revenge
which
she
felt
was
a
weakness
utterly
unworthy
of
her
and
too
much
like
that
inconsequent
weathercock
that
useless
insignificant
part
of
creation
those
objects
of
her
supreme
derision
and
contempt
those
frivolous
trifles
which
she
wondered
the
good
god
had
ever
troubled
himself
to
make
namely
les
hola

cried
the
zouave

leaning
out
of
a
little
casement
of
the
as

as
she
passed
it
a
la
bonne
heure
ma
belle
come
in

have
the
devil
own
fun
here
no
doubt
retorted
the
friend
of
the
flag
it
would
be
odd
if
the
would
not
fiddle
for
his
own
through
the
window
and
over
the
sturdy
shoulders
in
their
canvas
shirt
of
the
hero
tata
the
room
was
visible
full
of
smoke
through
which
the
lights
glimmered
like
the
sun
in
a
fog
reeking
with
bad
wines
crowded
with
laughing
bearded
faces
and
the
battered
beauty
of
women
revelers
while
on
the
table
singing
with
a
voice
mario
himself
could
not
have
rivaled
for
exquisite
sweetness
was
a
slender
zouave
gesticulating
with
the
most
marvelous
pantomime
while
his
melodious
tones
rolled
out
the
obscenest
and
wittiest
ballad
that
ever
was
caroled
in
a
guinguette
come
in
my
pretty
one
entreated
tata
stretching
out
his
brawn
arms
you
will
die
of
laughing
if
you
hear
such
a
song
a
pretty
song
yes
for
a
pigsty
said
cigarette
with
a
glance
into
the
chamber
and
she
shook
his
hand
off
her
and
went
on
down
the
street
a
night
or
two
before
a
new
song
from
the
best
tenor
in
the
whole
army
would
have
been
paradise
to
her
and
she
would
have
vaulted
through
the
window
at
a
single
bound
into
the
pandemonium
now
she
did
not
know
why
she
found
no
charm
in
it
and
she
went
quietly
home
to
her
little
in
her
garret
and
curled
herself
up
like
a
kitten
to
sleep
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
young
life
sleep
did
not
come
readily
to
her
and
when
it
did
come
for
the
first
time
found
a
restless
sigh
upon
her
laughing
mouth
chapter
xxii
the
mistress
of
the
white
king
fighting
in
the
kabaila
life
was
well
enough
but
here
thought
cecil
as
earlier
awake
than
those
of
his
chambree
he
stood
looking
down
the
lengthy
narrow
room
where
the
men
lay
asleep
along
the
bare
floor
tired
as
overworked
cattle
and
crouched
or
stretched
like
homeless
dogs
they
had
never
wakened
as
he
had
noiselessly
harnessed
himself
and
he
looked
at
them
with
that
interest
in
other
lives
that
had
come
to
him
through
adversity
for
if
misfortune
had
given
him
strength
it
had
also
given
him
sympathy
they
were
of
marvelously
various
types
these
sleepers
brought
under
one
roof
by
fates
the
most
diverse
close
beside
a
huge
and
sinewy
brute
of
an
auvergnat
whose
coarse
bestial
features
and
massive
bull
head
were
fitter
for
a
than
a
soldier
were
the
lithe
exquisite
limbs
and
the
oval
delicate
face
of
a
man
from
the
valley
of
the
rhone
beneath
a
canopy
of
flapping
tawny
skins
the
spoils
of
his
own
hands
was
flung
the
torso
of
one
of
the
splendid
peasants
of
the
sables
one
steeped
so
long
in
blood
and
wine
and
alcohol
that
he
had
forgotten
the
blue
bright
waves
that
broke
on
the
western
shores
of
his
boyhood
home
save
when
he
muttered
thirstily
in
his
dreams
of
the
cool
sea
as
he
was
muttering
now
next
him
curled
with
its
round
black
head
meeting
its
feet
was
a
wiry
frame
on
which
every
muscle
was
traced
like
network
and
the
skin
burned
black
as
jet
under
twenty
years
of
african
sun
the
midnight
streets
of
paris
had
seen
its
birth
the
thieves
quarter
had
been
its
nest
it
had
no
history
it
had
almost
no
humanity
it
was
a
perfect
machine
for
slaughter
no
more
who
had
ever
tried
to
make
it
more
further
on
lay
sleeping
fitfully
a
boy
of
scarcely
more
than
seventeen
with
rounded
cheeks
and
fair
white
brow
like
a
child
whose
uncovered
chest
was
delicate
as
a
girl
and
through
whose
long
brown
lashes
tears
in
his
slumber
were
stealing
as
his
rosy
mouth
murmured
mere
mere
pauvre
mere
he
was
a
young
conscript
taken
from
the
glad
of
the
loire
and
from
the
little
dwelling
up
in
the
rock
beside
the
sunny
brimming
river
and
under
its
grape
leaves
and
coils
that
was
dearer
to
him
than
is
the
palace
to
its
heir
there
were
many
others
beside
these
and
cecil
looked
at
them
with
those
weary
speculative
meditative
fancies
which
very
alien
to
his
temperament
stole
on
him
occasionally
in
the
privations
and
loneliness
of
his
existence
here
loneliness
in
the
midst
of
numbers
the
most
painful
of
all
solitude
life
was
bearable
enough
to
him
in
the
activity
of
campaigning
in
the
excitement
of
warfare
there
were
times
even
when
it
yielded
him
absolute
enjoyment
and
brought
him
interests
more
genuine
and
vivid
than
any
he
had
known
in
his
former
world
but
in
the
monotony
and
the
confinement
of
the
barrack
routine
his
days
were
often
intolerable
to
him
morning
after
morning
he
rose
to
the
same
weary
round
of
duty
the
same
series
of
petty
irritations
of
physical
privations
of
irksome
repetitions
to
take
a
toss
of
black
rough
coffee
and
begin
the
day
knowing
it
would
bring
with
it
endless
annoyances
without
one
gleam
of
hope
rose
to
spend
hours
on
the
in
the
glare
of
a
burning
sun
railed
at
if
a
trooper
accouterments
were
awry
or
an
insubordinate
scoundrel
had
pawned
his
regulation
shirt
to
be
incessantly
witness
of
tyrannies
and
cruelties
he
was
powerless
to
prevent
and
which
he
continually
saw
undo
all
he
had
done
and
render
men
desperate
whom
he
had
spent
months
in
endeavoring
to
make
contented
to
have
as
the
only
diversions
for
his
few
instants
of
leisure
loathsome
pleasures
that
disgusted
the
senses
they
were
meant
to
indulge
and
that
brought
him
to
scenes
of
low
debauchery
from
which
all
the
old
fastidious
instincts
of
his
delicate
luxurious
taste
recoiled
with
such
a
life
as
this
he
often
wondered
regretfully
why
out
of
the
many
arab
swords
that
had
crossed
his
own
none
had
gone
straight
to
his
heart
why
out
of
the
many
wounds
that
had
kept
him
hovering
on
the
confines
of
the
grave
none
had
ever
brought
him
the
end
and
the
oblivion
of
death
had
he
been
subject
to
all
the
miseries
and
personal
hardships
of
his
present
career
but
had
only
owned
the
power
to
command
to
pardon
to
lead
and
to
direct
as
alan
bertie
before
him
had
done
with
his
irregular
cavalry
in
the
indian
plains
such
a
thought
would
never
have
crossed
him
he
was
far
too
thorough
a
soldier
not
then
to
have
been
not
only
satisfied
but
happy
what
made
his
life
in
the
barracks
of
algiers
so
bitter
were
the
impotency
the
subjection
the
compelled
obedience
to
a
bidding
that
he
knew
often
capricious
and
unjust
as
it
was
cruel
which
were
so
unendurable
to
his
natural
pride
yet
to
which
he
had
hitherto
rendered
undeviating
adhesion
and
submission
less
for
his
own
sake
than
for
that
of
the
men
around
him
who
he
knew
would
back
him
in
revolt
to
the
death
and
be
dealt
with
for
such
loyalty
to
him
in
the
fashion
that
the
vivandiere
words
had
pictured
with
such
terrible
force
and
truth
is
it
worth
while
to
go
on
with
it
would
it
not
be
the
wiser
way
to
draw
my
own
saber
across
my
throat
he
thought
as
the
brutalized
companionship
in
which
his
life
was
spent
struck
on
him
all
the
more
darkly
because
the
night
before
a
woman
voice
and
a
woman
face
had
recalled
memories
buried
for
twelve
long
years
but
after
so
long
a
fight
with
fate
so
long
a
victory
over
the
temptation
to
let
himself
drift
out
in
an
from
the
world
that
had
grown
so
dark
to
him
it
was
not
in
him
to
give
under
now
in
his
own
way
he
had
found
a
duty
to
do
here
though
he
would
have
laughed
at
anyone
who
should
have
used
the
word
duty
in
connection
with
him
in
his
own
way
amid
these
wild
spirits
who
would
have
been
blown
from
the
guns
mouths
to
serve
him
he
had
made
good
the
coeur
vaillant
se
fait
royaume
of
his
house
and
he
was
moreover
by
this
time
a
french
soldier
at
heart
and
in
habit
in
almost
all
things
though
the
english
gentleman
was
not
dead
in
him
under
the
harness
of
a
chasseur
this
morning
he
roused
the
men
of
his
chambree
with
that
kindly
gentleness
which
had
gone
so
far
in
its
novelty
to
attach
their
liking
went
through
the
customary
routine
of
his
past
with
that
exactitude
and
punctuality
of
which
he
was
always
careful
to
set
the
example
made
his
breakfast
off
some
wretched
and
a
roll
of
black
bread
rode
fifty
miles
in
the
blazing
heat
of
the
african
day
at
the
head
of
a
score
of
his
on
convoy
duty
bringing
in
escort
a
long
string
of
from
the
region
of
the
kabaila
which
without
such
guard
might
have
been
swooped
down
on
and
borne
off
by
some
predatory
tribe
and
returned
jaded
weary
parched
with
thirst
scorched
through
with
heat
and
covered
with
white
dust
to
be
kept
waiting
in
his
saddle
by
his
colonel
orders
outside
the
barrack
for
of
an
hour
whether
to
receive
a
command
or
a
censure
he
was
left
in
ignorance
when
the
had
passed
he
was
told
le
commandant
had
gone
long
ago
and
did
not
require
him
cecil
said
nothing
yet
he
reeled
slightly
as
he
threw
himself
out
of
saddle
a
nausea
and
a
giddiness
had
come
on
him
to
have
passed
nigh
an
hour
motionless
in
his
stirrups
with
the
skies
like
brass
above
him
while
he
was
already
worn
with
riding
from
sunrise
to
sunset
with
little
to
appease
hunger
and
less
to
slake
thirst
made
him
despite
himself
stagger
dizzily
under
a
certain
sense
of
blindness
and
exhaustion
as
he
dismounted
the
chasseur
who
had
brought
him
the
message
caught
his
arm
eagerly
are
you
hurt
mon
caporal
cecil
shook
his
head
the
speaker
was
one
known
in
the
regiment
as
petit
picpon
who
had
begun
life
as
a
gamin
of
paris
and
now
bade
fair
to
make
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
the
soldiers
of
africa
petit
picpon
had
but
one
drawback
to
this
military
career
he
was
always
in
insubordination
the
old
gamin
was
not
dead
in
him
and
never
would
die
and
petit
picpon
accordingly
was
perpetually
a
hero
in
the
field
and
a
ragamuffin
in
the
times
of
peace
of
course
he
was
always
arrayed
against
authority
and
now
being
fond
of
his
galonne
with
that
curious
doglike
deathless
attachment
that
these
natures
all
reckless
wanton
destructive
and
mischievous
though
they
may
be
so
commonly
bestow
he
muttered
a
terrible
curse
under
his
fiercely
curled
mustaches
if
the
black
hawk
were
nailed
up
in
the
sun
like
a
kite
on
a
i
would
drive
twenty
nails
through
his
throat
cecil
turned
rapidly
on
him
silence
sir
or
i
must
report
you
another
speech
like
that
and
you
shall
have
a
turn
at
it
went
to
his
heart
to
rebuke
the
poor
fellow
for
an
outburst
of
indignation
which
had
its
root
in
regard
for
himself
but
he
knew
that
to
encourage
it
by
so
much
even
as
by
an
expression
of
gratitude
for
the
affection
borne
him
would
be
to
sow
further
and
deeper
the
of
that
inclination
to
mutiny
and
that
rebellious
hatred
against
their
chief
already
only
planted
too
strongly
in
the
squadrons
under
chateauroy
command
petit
picpon
looked
as
crestfallen
as
one
of
his
fraternity
could
he
knew
well
enough
that
what
he
had
said
could
get
him
twenty
blows
of
the
stick
if
his
corporal
chose
to
give
him
up
to
judgment
but
he
had
too
much
of
the
parisian
in
him
still
not
to
have
his
say
though
he
should
be
shot
for
it
send
me
to
beylick
if
you
like
corporal
he
said
sturdily
i
was
in
wrath
for
you
not
for
cecil
was
infinitely
more
touched
than
he
dared
for
the
sake
of
discipline
for
sake
of
the
speaker
himself
to
show
but
his
glance
dwelt
on
petit
picpon
with
a
look
that
the
quick
black
eyes
of
the
rebel
were
swift
to
read
i
know
he
said
gravely
i
do
not
misjudge
you
but
at
the
same
time
my
name
must
never
serve
as
a
pretext
for
insubordination
such
men
as
care
to
pleasure
me
will
best
do
so
in
making
my
duty
light
by
their
own
and
obedience
to
the
rules
of
their
he
led
his
horse
away
and
petit
picpon
went
on
an
errand
he
had
been
sent
to
do
in
the
streets
for
one
of
the
officers
picpon
was
unusually
thoughtful
and
sober
in
deportment
for
him
since
he
was
usually
given
to
making
his
progress
along
a
road
taken
unobserved
by
those
in
command
over
him
with
hands
and
heels
in
the
dexterous
somersaults
of
his
early
days
now
he
went
along
without
any
unprofessional
antics
biting
the
tip
of
a
cigar
which
he
had
picked
up
off
the
pavement
in
sheer
instinct
retained
from
the
old
times
when
he
had
used
to
rush
in
the
foremost
of
la
queue
into
the
forsaken
theaters
of
bouffes
or
of
varietes
in
search
for
those
odds
and
ends
which
the
departed
audience
might
have
left
behind
them
one
of
the
favorite
modes
of
seeking
a
livelihood
with
the
parisian
dame
i
will
give
it
up
then
resolved
picpon
half
aloud
valorously
now
picpon
had
come
forth
on
evil
thoughts
intent
his
officer
a
careless
and
extravagant
man
the
richest
man
in
the
regiment
had
given
him
a
rather
small
velvet
bag
sealed
with
directions
to
take
it
to
a
certain
notorious
beauty
of
algiers
whose
handsome
moresco
eyes
smiled
or
at
least
he
believed
so
exclusively
for
the
time
on
the
sender
picpon
was
very
quick
intelligent
and
much
liked
by
his
superiors
so
that
he
was
often
employed
on
errands
and
the
tricks
he
played
in
the
execution
thereof
were
so
adroitly
done
that
they
were
never
detected
picpon
had
chuckled
to
himself
over
this
mission
it
was
but
the
work
of
an
instant
for
the
lithe
nimble
fingers
of
the
to
undo
the
bag
without
touching
the
seal
to
see
that
it
contained
a
hundred
napoleons
with
a
note
to
slip
the
gold
into
the
folds
of
his
ceinturon
to
fill
up
the
sack
with
to
make
it
assume
its
original
form
so
that
none
could
have
imagined
it
had
been
touched
and
to
proceed
with
it
thus
to
the
moorish
lionne
dwelling
the
negro
who
always
opened
her
door
would
take
it
in
picpon
would
hint
to
him
to
be
careful
as
it
contained
some
rare
and
rich
sweetmeats
negro
nature
he
well
knew
would
impel
him
to
search
for
the
bonbons
and
the
bag
under
his
clumsy
treatment
would
bear
plain
marks
of
having
been
tampered
with
and
as
the
african
had
a
most
thievish
reputation
he
would
never
be
believed
if
he
swore
himself
guiltless
voila
here
was
a
neat
trick
if
it
had
a
drawback
it
was
that
it
was
too
simple
too
little
risque
a
child
might
do
it
still
a
hundred
naps
what
fat
geese
what
flagons
of
brandy
what
dozens
of
wine
what
rich
soups
what
tavern
banquets
they
would
bring
picpon
had
chuckled
again
as
he
arranged
the
little
bag
so
carefully
with
its
and
pictured
the
rage
of
the
beautiful
moor
when
she
should
discover
the
contents
and
order
the
stick
to
her
negro
ah
that
was
what
picpon
called
fun
to
appreciate
the
full
force
of
such
fun
it
is
necessary
to
have
also
appreciated
the
gamin
to
understand
the
legitimate
aspect
such
a
theft
bore
it
is
necessary
to
have
also
understood
the
unrecordable
codes
that
govern
the
genus
pratique
into
which
the
genus
gamin
when
at
maturity
develops
picpon
was
quite
in
love
with
his
joke
it
was
only
a
good
joke
in
his
sight
and
indeed
men
need
to
live
as
hardly
as
an
african
soldier
lives
to
estimate
the
full
temptation
that
gold
can
have
when
you
have
come
to
look
on
a
cat
as
very
good
eating
and
to
have
nothing
to
gnaw
but
a
bit
of
old
through
the
whole
of
the
long
hours
of
a
burning
day
of
and
to
estimate
as
well
the
full
width
and
depth
of
the
renunciation
that
made
him
mutter
now
so
valorously
dame
i
will
give
it
up
then
picpon
did
not
know
himself
as
he
said
it
yet
he
turned
down
into
a
lonely
narrow
lane
under
marble
walls
overtopped
with
fig
and
palm
from
some
fine
gardens
undid
the
bag
for
the
second
time
whisked
out
the
and
threw
them
over
the
wall
so
that
they
should
be
out
of
his
reach
if
he
repented
put
back
the
napoleons
closed
the
little
sack
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
scamper
to
his
destination
delivered
his
charge
into
the
fair
lady
own
hands
and
relieved
his
feelings
by
a
score
of
somersaults
along
the
pavement
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
go
ma
cantche
he
thought
as
he
stood
on
his
head
with
his
legs
at
an
acute
angle
in
the
air
in
position
very
favored
by
him
for
moments
of
reflection
he
said
his
brain
worked
better
upside
down
ma
cantche
what
a
weakness
what
a
weakness
what
remorse
to
have
yielded
to
it
beneath
you
picpon
utterly
beneath
you
just
because
that
says
such
follies
please
him
in
us
picpon
then
in
his
gamin
stage
had
been
enrolled
in
the
chasseurs
at
the
same
time
with
the
as
they
called
bertie
and
following
his
gamin
nature
had
exhausted
all
his
resources
of
impudence
maliciousness
and
power
of
tormenting
on
the
aristocrat
somewhat
disappointed
however
that
the
utmost
ingenuities
of
his
insolence
and
even
his
malignity
never
succeeded
in
breaking
the
aristocrat
silence
and
contemptuous
forbearance
from
all
reprisal
for
the
first
two
years
the
which
life
with
a
regiment
seemed
to
cecil
was
a
hundredfold
embittered
by
the
brutalized
jests
and
torments
of
this
little
odious
chimpanzee
of
paris
one
day
however
it
chanced
that
a
detachment
of
chasseurs
of
which
cecil
was
one
was
cut
to
pieces
by
such
an
overwhelming
mass
of
arabs
that
scarce
a
dozen
of
them
could
force
their
way
through
the
bedouins
with
life
he
was
among
those
few
and
a
flight
at
full
speed
was
the
sole
chance
of
regaining
their
encampment
just
as
he
had
shaken
his
bridle
free
of
the
arab
clutch
and
had
mowed
himself
a
clear
path
through
their
ranks
he
caught
sight
of
his
young
enemy
picpon
on
the
ground
with
a
lance
broken
off
in
his
ribs
guarding
his
head
with
bleeding
hands
as
the
horses
trampled
over
him
to
make
a
dash
at
the
boy
though
to
linger
a
moment
was
to
risk
certain
death
to
send
his
steel
through
an
arab
who
came
in
his
way
to
lean
down
and
catch
hold
of
the
lad
sash
to
swing
him
up
into
his
saddle
and
throw
him
across
it
in
front
of
him
and
to
charge
afresh
through
the
storm
of
and
ride
on
thus
burdened
was
the
work
of
ten
seconds
with
and
he
brought
the
boy
safe
over
a
stretch
of
six
leagues
in
a
flight
for
life
though
the
imp
no
more
deserved
the
compassion
than
a
scorpion
that
has
spent
all
its
noxious
day
stinging
at
every
point
of
uncovered
flesh
would
merit
tenderness
from
the
hand
it
had
poisoned
when
he
was
swung
down
from
the
saddle
and
laid
in
front
of
a
fire
sheltered
from
the
bitter
north
wind
that
was
then
blowing
cruelly
the
bright
black
eyes
of
the
parisian
diablotin
opened
with
a
strange
gleam
in
them
picpon
souviendra
he
murmured
and
picpon
had
kept
his
word
he
had
remembered
often
he
remembered
now
standing
on
his
head
and
thinking
of
his
hundred
napoleons
surrendered
because
thieving
and
lying
in
the
regiment
gave
pain
to
that
oddly
prejudiced
this
was
the
sort
of
loyalty
that
the
rendered
this
was
the
sort
of
influence
that
the
english
guardsman
exercised
among
his
roumis
meantime
while
picpon
made
a
human
cone
of
himself
to
the
admiration
of
the
polyglot
crowd
of
the
algerine
street
cecil
himself
having
watered
fed
and
littered
down
his
tired
horse
made
his
way
to
a
little
cafe
he
commonly
frequented
and
spent
the
few
sous
he
could
afford
on
an
iced
draught
of
drink
eat
he
could
not
overfatigue
had
given
him
a
nausea
for
food
and
the
last
hour
motionless
in
the
intense
glow
of
the
afternoon
sun
had
brought
that
racking
pain
through
his
temples
which
assailed
him
rarely
now
but
which
in
his
first
years
in
africa
had
given
him
many
hours
of
agony
he
could
not
stay
in
the
cafe
it
was
the
hour
of
dinner
for
many
and
the
odors
joined
with
the
noise
were
insupportable
to
him
a
few
doors
farther
in
the
street
which
was
chiefly
of
jewish
and
moslem
shops
there
was
a
quaint
place
kept
by
an
old
moor
who
had
some
of
the
rarest
and
most
beautiful
treasures
of
algerian
workmanship
in
his
long
dark
silent
chambers
with
this
old
man
cecil
had
something
of
a
friendship
he
had
protected
him
one
day
from
the
mockery
and
outrage
of
some
drunken
indigenes
and
the
moor
warmly
grateful
was
ever
ready
to
give
him
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
stillness
of
his
dwelling
its
resort
was
sometimes
welcome
to
him
as
the
one
spot
quiet
and
noiseless
to
which
he
could
escape
out
of
the
continuous
turmoil
of
street
and
of
barrack
and
he
went
thither
now
he
found
the
old
man
sitting
behind
the
counter
a
aged
mussulman
with
a
long
beard
like
white
silk
with
cashmeres
and
broidered
stuffs
of
peerless
texture
hanging
above
his
head
and
all
around
him
things
of
silver
of
gold
of
ivory
of
amber
of
feathers
of
bronze
of
emeralds
of
ruby
of
beryl
whose
rich
colors
glowed
through
the
darkness
no
coffee
no
sherbet
thanks
good
father
said
cecil
in
answer
to
the
moor
hospitable
entreaties
give
me
only
license
to
sit
in
the
quiet
here
i
am
very
sit
and
be
welcome
my
son
said
ben
arsli
whom
should
this
roof
shelter
in
honor
if
not
thee
musjid
shall
bring
thee
the
supreme
the
supreme
solace
was
a
nargile
and
its
great
bowl
of
was
soon
set
down
by
the
little
moorish
lad
at
cecil
side
whether
fatigue
really
weighted
his
eyes
with
slumber
or
whether
the
soothing
sedative
of
the
pipe
had
its
influence
he
had
not
sat
long
in
the
perfect
stillness
of
the
moor
shop
before
the
narrow
view
of
the
street
under
the
awning
without
was
lost
to
him
the
luster
and
confusion
of
shadowy
hues
swam
a
while
before
his
eyes
the
throbbing
pain
in
his
temples
grew
duller
and
he
slept
the
heavy
dreamless
sleep
of
intense
exhaustion
ben
arsli
glanced
at
him
and
bade
musjid
be
very
quiet
half
an
hour
or
more
passed
none
had
entered
the
place
the
grave
old
moslem
was
half
slumbering
himself
when
there
came
a
delicate
odor
of
perfumed
laces
a
delicate
rustle
of
silk
swept
the
floor
a
lady
voice
asked
the
price
of
an
superbly
mounted
in
gold
ben
arsli
opened
his
eyes
the
chasseur
slept
on
the
newcomer
was
one
of
those
great
ladies
who
now
and
then
winter
in
algeria
her
carriage
waited
without
she
was
alone
making
purchase
of
those
innumerable
splendid
trifles
with
which
algiers
is
rife
while
she
drove
through
the
town
in
the
cooler
hour
before
the
sun
sank
into
the
western
sea
the
moor
rose
instantly
with
profound
salaams
before
her
and
began
to
spread
before
her
the
richest
treasures
of
his
stock
under
plea
of
the
light
he
remained
near
the
entrance
with
her
money
was
dear
to
him
and
must
not
be
lost
but
he
would
make
it
if
he
could
without
awakening
the
tired
soldier
marvelous
caskets
of
carpets
soft
as
down
with
every
brilliant
hue
melting
one
within
another
coffee
equipages
of
inimitable
metal
work
silver
statuettes
exquisitely
chased
and
wrought
and
screens
of
every
beauty
of
device
were
spread
before
her
and
many
of
them
were
bought
by
her
with
that
unerring
grace
of
taste
and
lavishness
of
expenditure
which
were
her
characteristics
but
which
are
far
from
always
found
in
unison
and
throughout
her
survey
ben
arsli
kept
her
near
the
entrance
and
cecil
had
slept
on
unaroused
by
the
low
tones
of
their
voices
a
roll
of
notes
had
passed
from
her
hand
to
the
moslem
and
she
was
about
to
glide
out
to
her
carriage
when
a
lamp
which
hung
at
the
farther
end
caught
her
fancy
it
was
very
singular
a
mingling
of
colored
glass
silver
gold
and
ivory
being
wrought
in
much
beauty
in
its
formation
is
that
for
sale
she
inquired
as
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
she
moved
up
the
shop
and
her
eyes
being
lifted
to
the
lamp
had
drawn
close
to
cecil
before
she
saw
him
when
she
did
so
she
paused
near
in
astonishment
is
that
soldier
asleep
he
is
madame
softly
answered
the
old
man
in
his
slow
studied
french
he
comes
here
to
rest
sometimes
out
of
the
noise
he
was
very
tired
and
i
think
ill
would
he
have
confessed
indeed
her
eyes
fell
on
him
with
compassion
he
had
fallen
into
an
attitude
of
much
grace
and
of
utter
exhaustion
his
head
was
uncovered
and
rested
on
one
arm
so
that
the
face
was
turned
upward
with
a
woman
rapid
comprehensive
glance
she
saw
that
dark
shadow
like
a
bruise
under
his
closed
aching
eyes
she
saw
the
weary
pain
upon
his
forehead
she
saw
the
whiteness
of
his
hands
the
slenderness
of
his
wrists
the
softness
of
his
hair
she
saw
as
she
had
seen
before
that
whatever
he
might
be
now
in
some
past
time
he
had
been
a
man
of
gentle
blood
of
courtly
bearing
he
is
a
chasseur
she
asked
the
moslem
yes
madame
i
think
he
must
have
been
something
very
different
some
she
did
not
answer
she
stood
with
her
thoughtful
eyes
gazing
on
the
soldier
he
saved
me
once
madame
at
much
risk
to
himself
from
the
savagery
of
some
turcos
the
old
man
went
on
of
course
he
is
always
welcome
under
my
roof
the
companionship
he
has
must
be
bitter
to
him
i
fancy
they
do
say
he
would
have
had
his
officer
grade
and
the
cross
too
long
before
now
if
it
were
not
for
his
colonel
ah
i
have
seen
him
before
now
he
carves
in
ivory
i
suppose
he
has
a
good
side
for
those
things
with
you
the
moor
looked
up
in
amazement
in
ivory
madame
he
allah
i
never
heard
of
it
it
is
strange
very
strange
doubtless
you
would
have
given
him
a
good
price
for
them
surely
i
would
any
price
he
should
have
wished
do
i
not
owe
him
my
life
at
that
moment
little
musjid
let
fall
a
valuable
inlaid
with
amber
his
master
with
muttered
apology
hastened
to
the
scene
of
the
accident
the
noise
startled
cecil
and
his
eyes
unclosed
to
all
the
dreamy
fantastic
colors
of
the
place
and
met
those
bent
on
him
in
musing
pity
saw
that
lustrous
haughty
delicate
head
bending
slightly
down
through
the
shadows
he
thought
he
was
dreaming
yet
on
instinct
he
rose
staggering
slightly
for
sharp
pain
was
still
darting
through
his
head
and
temples
madame
pardon
me
was
i
sleeping
you
were
and
rest
again
you
look
ill
she
said
gently
and
there
was
for
a
moment
less
of
that
accent
in
her
voice
which
the
night
before
had
marked
so
distinctly
so
pointedly
the
line
of
demarcation
between
a
princess
of
spain
and
a
soldier
of
africa
i
thank
you
i
ail
he
had
no
sense
that
he
did
in
the
presence
of
that
face
which
had
the
beauty
of
his
old
life
under
the
charm
of
that
voice
which
had
the
music
of
his
buried
years
i
fear
that
is
scarcely
true
she
answered
him
you
look
in
pain
though
as
a
soldier
perhaps
you
will
not
own
it
a
headache
from
the
sun
no
more
he
was
careful
not
again
to
forget
the
social
gulf
which
yawned
between
them
that
is
quite
bad
enough
your
service
must
be
severe
in
africa
milady
one
can
not
expect
i
suppose
not
you
have
served
long
twelve
years
and
your
name
louis
she
fancied
there
was
a
slight
abruptness
in
the
reply
as
though
he
were
about
to
add
some
other
name
and
checked
himself
she
entered
it
in
the
little
book
from
which
she
had
taken
her
banknotes
i
may
be
able
to
serve
you
she
said
as
she
wrote
i
will
speak
of
you
to
the
marshal
and
when
i
return
to
paris
i
may
have
an
opportunity
to
bring
your
name
before
the
emperor
he
is
as
rapid
as
his
uncle
to
reward
military
merit
but
he
has
not
his
uncle
opportunities
for
personal
observation
of
his
the
color
flushed
his
forehead
you
do
me
much
honor
he
said
rapidly
but
if
you
would
gratify
me
madame
do
not
seek
to
do
anything
of
the
and
why
do
you
not
even
desire
the
cross
i
desire
nothing
except
to
be
you
seek
what
others
dread
then
it
may
be
so
at
any
rate
if
you
would
serve
me
madame
never
say
what
can
bring
me
into
she
regarded
him
with
much
surprise
with
some
slight
sense
of
annoyance
she
had
bent
far
in
tendering
her
influence
at
the
french
court
to
a
private
soldier
and
his
rejection
of
it
seemed
as
ungracious
as
it
was
inexplicable
at
that
moment
the
moor
joined
them
milady
has
told
me
victor
that
you
are
a
carver
of
ivories
how
is
it
that
you
have
never
let
me
benefit
by
your
art
my
things
are
not
worth
a
sou
muttered
cecil
hurriedly
you
do
them
great
injustice
and
yourself
also
said
the
grande
dame
more
coldly
than
she
had
before
spoken
your
carvings
are
singularly
perfect
and
should
bring
you
considerable
why
have
you
never
shown
them
to
me
at
least
pursued
ben
arsli
why
not
have
given
me
my
option
the
blood
flushed
cecil
face
again
he
turned
to
the
princess
i
withheld
them
madame
not
because
he
would
have
underpriced
but
overpriced
them
he
rates
a
trifling
act
of
mine
of
long
ago
so
she
bent
her
head
in
silence
yet
a
more
graceful
comprehension
of
his
motive
she
could
not
have
given
than
her
glance
alone
gave
ben
arsli
stroked
his
great
beard
more
moved
than
his
moslem
dignity
would
show
always
so
he
muttered
always
so
my
son
in
some
life
before
this
was
not
generosity
your
ruin
milady
was
about
to
purchase
the
lamp
asked
cecil
avoiding
the
question
her
highness
will
not
find
anything
like
it
in
all
the
lamp
was
taken
down
and
the
conversation
turned
from
himself
may
i
bear
it
to
your
carriage
madame
he
asked
as
she
moved
to
leave
having
made
it
her
own
while
her
footman
carried
out
the
smaller
articles
she
had
bought
to
the
equipage
she
bowed
in
silence
she
was
very
exclusive
she
was
not
wholly
satisfied
with
herself
for
having
conversed
thus
with
a
chasseur
in
a
moor
bazaar
still
she
vaguely
felt
pity
for
this
man
she
equally
vaguely
desired
to
serve
him
wait
victor
she
said
as
he
closed
the
door
of
her
carriage
i
accepted
your
chessmen
last
night
but
you
are
very
certain
that
it
is
impossible
i
can
retain
them
on
such
a
shadow
darkened
his
face
let
your
dogs
break
them
then
madame
they
shall
not
come
back
to
you
mistake
i
did
not
mean
that
i
would
send
them
back
i
simply
desire
to
offer
you
some
equivalent
for
them
there
must
be
something
that
you
wish
for
something
which
would
be
acceptable
to
you
in
the
life
you
lead
i
have
already
named
the
only
thing
i
he
had
been
solicitous
to
remember
and
sustain
the
enormous
difference
in
their
social
degrees
but
at
the
offer
of
her
gifts
of
her
patronage
of
her
recompense
the
pride
of
his
old
life
rose
up
to
meet
her
own
to
be
forgotten
a
sad
wish
nay
surely
life
in
a
regiment
of
africa
can
not
be
so
cloudless
that
it
can
create
in
you
no
other
it
is
not
i
have
then
tell
it
to
me
it
shall
be
it
is
to
enjoy
a
luxury
long
ago
lost
forever
it
is
to
be
allowed
to
give
the
slight
courtesy
of
a
gentleman
without
being
tendered
the
wage
of
a
she
understood
him
she
was
moved
too
by
the
inflexion
of
his
voice
she
was
not
so
cold
not
so
negligent
as
the
world
called
her
i
had
passed
my
word
to
grant
it
i
can
not
retract
she
answered
him
after
a
pause
i
will
press
nothing
more
on
you
but
as
an
obligation
to
me
can
you
find
no
way
in
which
a
rouleau
of
gold
would
benefit
your
men
no
way
that
i
can
take
it
for
them
but
if
you
care
indeed
to
do
them
a
charity
a
little
wine
a
little
fruit
a
few
flowers
for
there
are
those
among
them
who
love
flowers
sent
to
the
hospital
will
bring
many
benedictions
on
your
name
madame
they
lie
in
infinite
misery
there
i
will
remember
she
said
simply
while
a
thoughtful
sadness
passed
over
her
brilliant
face
adieu
le
caporal
and
if
you
should
think
better
of
your
choice
and
will
allow
your
name
to
be
mentioned
by
me
to
his
majesty
send
me
word
through
my
people
there
is
my
the
carriage
whirled
away
down
the
crooked
street
he
stood
under
the
tawny
awning
of
the
moorish
house
with
the
thin
glazed
card
in
his
hand
on
it
was
printed
mme
la
princesse
corona
hotel
corona
in
the
corner
was
written
villa
aiaussa
he
thrust
it
in
the
folds
of
his
sash
and
turned
within
do
you
know
her
he
asked
ben
arsli
the
old
man
shook
his
head
she
is
the
most
beautiful
of
thy
many
fair
frankish
women
i
never
saw
her
till
but
listen
here
touching
these
ivory
toys
if
thou
does
not
bring
henceforth
to
me
all
the
work
in
them
that
thou
doest
thou
shalt
never
come
here
more
to
meet
the
light
of
her
cecil
smiled
and
pressed
the
moslem
hand
i
kept
them
away
because
you
would
have
given
me
a
hundred
piasters
for
what
had
not
been
worth
one
as
for
her
eyes
they
are
stars
that
shine
on
another
world
than
an
african
trooper
so
best
yet
they
were
stars
of
which
he
thought
more
as
he
wended
his
way
back
to
the
barracks
than
of
the
splendid
constellations
of
the
algerian
evening
that
shone
with
all
the
luster
of
the
day
but
with
the
soft
enchanted
light
which
transfigured
sea
and
earth
and
sky
as
never
did
the
day
full
glow
as
he
returned
to
the
mechanical
duties
to
the
thankless
services
to
the
distasteful
meal
to
the
riotous
mirth
to
the
coarse
comradeship
which
seemed
to
him
more
bitter
than
they
had
ever
done
since
his
very
identity
his
very
existence
had
been
killed
and
buried
past
recall
past
resurrection
under
the
kepi
of
a
chasseur
meanwhile
the
princess
corona
drove
homeward
homeward
to
where
a
temporary
home
had
been
made
by
her
in
the
most
elegant
of
the
many
villas
that
stud
the
sides
of
the
sahel
and
face
the
bright
bow
of
the
sunlit
bay
a
villa
with
balconies
and
awnings
and
cool
silent
chambers
and
rich
glowing
gardens
and
a
broad
low
roof
half
hidden
in
bay
and
orange
and
myrtle
and
basilica
and
the
liquid
sound
of
waters
bubbling
beneath
a
riotous
luxuriance
of
blossom
mme
la
princesse
passed
from
her
carriage
to
her
own
morning
room
and
sank
down
on
a
couch
a
little
listless
and
weary
with
her
search
among
the
treasures
of
the
algerine
bazaars
it
was
purposeless
work
after
all
had
she
not
bronzes
and
porcelains
and
and
objets
in
profusion
in
her
roman
villa
her
parisian
hotel
her
great
grim
palace
in
estremadura
not
one
of
those
things
do
i
want
not
one
shall
i
look
at
twice
the
money
would
have
been
better
at
the
soldiers
hospital
she
thought
while
her
eyes
dwelt
on
a
near
her
a
table
on
which
the
mimic
hosts
of
chasseurs
and
arabs
were
ranged
in
opposite
squadrons
she
took
the
white
king
in
her
hand
and
gazed
at
it
with
a
certain
interest
that
man
has
been
noble
once
she
thought
what
a
fate
what
a
cruel
fate
it
touched
her
to
great
pity
although
proud
with
too
intense
a
pride
her
nature
was
exceedingly
generous
and
when
once
moved
deeply
compassionate
the
unerring
glance
of
a
woman
habituated
to
the
first
society
of
europe
had
told
her
that
the
accent
the
bearing
the
tone
the
features
of
this
soldier
who
only
asked
of
life
oblivion
were
those
of
one
originally
of
gentle
blood
and
the
dignity
and
patience
of
his
acceptance
of
the
indignities
which
his
present
rank
entailed
on
him
had
not
escaped
her
any
more
than
the
delicate
beauty
of
his
face
as
she
had
seen
it
weary
pale
and
shadowed
with
pain
in
the
unconscious
revelation
of
sleep
how
bitter
his
life
must
be
she
mused
when
philip
comes
perhaps
he
will
show
some
way
to
aid
him
and
yet
who
can
serve
a
man
who
only
desires
to
be
forgotten
then
with
a
certain
impatient
sense
of
some
absurd
discrepancy
of
some
unseemly
occupation
in
her
thus
dwelling
on
the
wishes
and
the
burdens
of
a
of
light
cavalry
she
laughed
a
little
and
put
the
white
chief
back
once
more
in
his
place
yet
even
as
she
set
the
king
among
his
mimic
forces
the
very
carvings
themselves
served
to
retain
their
artist
in
her
memory
there
was
about
them
an
indescribable
elegance
an
exceeding
grace
and
beauty
which
spoke
of
a
knowledge
of
art
and
of
refinement
of
taste
far
beyond
those
of
a
mere
military
amateur
in
the
one
who
had
produced
them
what
could
bring
a
man
of
that
talent
with
that
address
into
the
ranks
she
mused
persons
of
good
family
of
once
fine
position
come
here
they
say
and
live
and
die
unrecognized
under
the
imperial
flag
it
is
usually
some
dishonor
that
drives
them
out
of
their
own
worlds
it
may
be
so
with
him
yet
he
does
not
look
like
one
whom
shame
has
touched
he
is
proud
still
prouder
than
he
knows
more
likely
it
is
the
old
old
story
a
high
name
and
a
narrow
fortune
the
ruin
of
thousands
he
is
french
i
suppose
a
french
aristocrat
who
has
played
au
roi
depouille
most
probably
and
buried
himself
and
his
history
forever
beneath
those
two
names
that
tell
one
nothing
louis
victor
well
it
is
no
matter
of
mine
very
possibly
he
is
a
mere
adventurer
with
a
good
manner
this
army
here
is
a
they
say
of
all
the
varied
scoundrelisms
of
europe
she
left
the
and
went
onward
to
the
dressing
and
bath
and
bed
chambers
which
opened
in
one
suite
from
her
boudoir
and
resigned
herself
to
the
hands
of
her
attendants
for
her
dinner
toilet
the
moslem
had
said
aright
of
her
beauty
and
now
as
her
splendid
hair
was
unloosened
and
gathered
up
afresh
with
a
comb
of
gold
that
was
not
brighter
than
the
tresses
themselves
the
brilliant
haughty
thoughtful
face
was
of
a
truth
as
he
had
said
the
fairest
that
had
ever
come
from
the
frankish
shores
to
the
hot
african
many
beside
the
old
moslem
had
thought
it
the
fairest
that
the
sun
shone
on
and
held
one
grave
lustrous
glance
of
the
blue
imperial
eyes
above
aught
else
on
earth
many
had
loved
her
all
without
return
yet
although
only
twenty
years
had
passed
over
her
proud
head
the
princesse
corona
had
been
wedded
and
been
widowed
wedded
with
no
other
sentiment
than
that
of
a
certain
pity
and
a
certain
honor
for
the
man
whose
noble
spanish
name
she
took
widowed
by
a
death
that
was
the
seal
of
her
marriage
sacrament
and
left
her
his
wife
only
in
name
and
law
the
marriage
had
left
no
chain
upon
her
it
had
only
made
her
mistress
of
wide
wealth
of
that
villa
on
the
sicilian
sea
of
that
light
spacious
in
paris
that
bore
her
name
of
that
vast
majestic
old
castle
throned
on
brown
estremaduran
crags
and
looking
down
on
mighty
woods
of
cork
and
chestnut
and
flashing
streams
of
falling
water
hurling
through
the
gorges
the
death
had
left
no
regret
upon
her
it
only
gave
her
for
a
while
a
graver
shadow
over
the
brilliancy
of
her
youth
and
of
her
beauty
and
gave
her
for
always
or
for
so
long
at
least
as
she
chose
to
use
it
a
plea
for
that
indifference
to
men
worship
of
her
which
their
sex
called
heartlessness
which
her
own
sex
thought
an
coquetry
and
which
was
in
real
truth
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
but
simply
the
negligence
of
a
woman
very
difficult
to
touch
and
as
it
had
seemed
impossible
to
charm
none
knew
quite
aright
the
history
of
that
marriage
some
were
wont
to
whisper
ambition
and
when
that
whisper
came
round
to
her
her
splendid
lips
would
curl
with
as
splendid
a
scorn
do
they
not
know
that
scarce
any
marriage
can
mate
us
equally
she
would
ask
for
she
came
of
a
great
line
that
thought
few
royal
branches
on
equality
with
it
and
she
cherished
as
things
of
strictest
creed
the
legends
that
gave
her
race
with
its
amber
hair
and
its
eyes
of
sapphire
blue
the
blood
of
arthur
in
their
veins
of
a
surety
it
was
not
ambition
that
had
allied
her
on
his
with
beltran
corona
but
what
it
was
the
world
could
never
tell
precisely
the
world
would
not
have
believed
it
if
it
had
heard
the
truth
the
truth
that
it
had
been
in
a
different
fashion
a
gleam
of
something
of
the
same
compassion
that
now
made
her
merciful
to
a
common
trooper
of
africa
which
had
wedded
her
to
the
dead
spanish
prince
compassion
which
with
many
another
rich
and
generous
thing
lay
beneath
her
coldness
and
her
pride
as
the
golden
stamen
lies
folded
within
the
white
virginal
chill
cup
of
the
lily
she
had
never
felt
a
touch
of
even
passing
preference
to
any
one
out
of
the
many
who
had
sought
her
beauty
she
was
too
proud
to
be
easily
moved
to
such
selection
and
she
was
far
too
habituated
to
homage
to
be
wrought
upon
by
it
ever
so
slightly
she
was
of
a
noble
gracious
nature
she
had
been
always
happy
always
obeyed
always
caressed
always
adored
it
had
rendered
her
immeasurably
contemptuous
of
flattery
it
had
rendered
her
a
little
contemptuous
of
pain
she
had
never
had
aught
to
regret
it
was
not
possible
that
she
could
realize
what
regret
was
hence
men
called
and
found
her
very
cold
yet
those
of
her
own
kin
whom
she
loved
knew
that
the
heart
of
a
summer
rose
was
not
warmer
nor
sweeter
nor
richer
than
hers
and
first
among
these
was
her
brother
at
once
her
guardian
and
her
slave
who
thought
her
perfect
and
would
no
more
have
crossed
her
will
than
he
would
have
set
his
foot
on
her
beautiful
imperial
head
corona
had
been
his
friend
the
only
one
for
whom
he
had
ever
sought
to
break
her
unvarying
indifference
to
her
lovers
but
for
whom
even
he
had
pleaded
vainly
until
one
autumn
season
when
they
had
stayed
together
at
a
great
archducal
castle
in
south
austria
in
one
of
the
awaiting
the
fanfare
of
the
hunt
she
rejected
for
the
third
time
the
passionate
supplication
of
the
superb
noble
who
ranked
with
the
and
the
he
rode
from
her
in
great
bitterness
in
grief
that
no
way
moved
her
she
was
importuned
with
these
entreaties
to
weariness
an
hour
after
he
was
brought
past
her
wounded
and
senseless
he
had
saved
her
brother
from
imminent
death
at
his
own
cost
and
the
tusks
of
the
mighty
styrian
boar
had
plunged
through
and
through
his
frame
as
they
had
met
in
the
narrow
woodland
glade
he
will
be
a
cripple
a
paralyzed
cripple
for
life
said
the
one
whose
life
had
been
saved
by
his
devotion
to
her
that
night
and
his
lips
shook
a
little
under
his
golden
beard
as
he
spoke
she
looked
at
him
she
loved
him
well
and
no
homage
to
herself
could
have
moved
her
as
this
sacrifice
for
him
had
done
you
think
he
will
live
she
asked
they
say
it
is
sure
he
may
live
on
to
old
age
but
how
my
god
what
a
death
in
life
and
all
for
my
sake
in
my
stead
she
was
silent
several
moments
then
she
raised
her
face
a
little
paler
than
it
had
been
but
with
a
passionless
resolve
set
on
it
philip
we
do
not
leave
our
debts
unpaid
go
tell
him
i
will
be
his
his
wife
now
venetia
go
she
said
briefly
tell
him
what
i
but
what
a
sacrifice
in
your
beauty
your
youth
he
did
not
count
cost
are
we
less
generous
go
tell
he
was
told
and
was
repaid
such
a
light
of
unutterable
joy
burned
through
the
misty
agony
of
his
eyes
as
never
it
seemed
to
those
who
saw
had
beamed
before
in
mortal
eyes
he
did
not
once
hesitate
at
the
acceptance
of
her
he
only
pleaded
that
the
marriage
ceremony
should
pass
between
them
that
night
there
were
notaries
and
many
priests
in
the
great
ducal
household
all
was
done
as
he
desired
she
consented
without
wavering
she
had
passed
her
word
she
would
not
have
withdrawn
it
if
it
had
been
a
thousand
times
more
bitter
in
its
fulfillment
the
honor
of
her
house
was
dearer
to
her
than
any
individual
happiness
this
man
for
them
had
lost
peace
health
joy
strength
every
hope
of
life
to
dedicate
her
own
life
to
him
as
he
had
vainly
prayed
her
when
in
the
full
glow
and
vigor
of
his
manhood
was
the
only
means
by
which
their
vast
debt
to
him
could
be
paid
to
so
pay
it
was
the
instant
choice
of
her
high
code
of
honor
and
of
her
generosity
that
would
not
be
outrun
moreover
she
pitied
him
unspeakably
though
her
heart
had
no
tenderness
for
him
she
had
dismissed
him
with
cold
disdain
and
he
had
gone
from
her
to
save
the
only
life
she
loved
and
was
stretched
a
stricken
broken
helpless
wreck
with
endless
years
of
pain
and
weariness
before
him
at
midnight
in
the
great
dim
magnificence
of
the
state
chamber
where
he
lay
and
with
the
low
soft
chanting
of
the
chapel
choir
from
afar
echoing
through
the
incensed
air
she
bent
her
haughty
head
down
over
his
couch
and
the
marriage
benediction
was
spoken
over
them
his
voice
was
faint
and
broken
but
it
had
the
thrill
of
a
passionate
triumph
in
it
when
the
last
words
were
uttered
he
lay
a
while
exhausted
silent
only
looking
ever
upward
at
her
with
his
dark
dreamy
eyes
in
which
the
old
love
glanced
so
strangely
through
the
blindness
of
pain
then
he
smiled
as
the
last
echo
of
the
choral
melodies
died
softly
on
the
silence
that
is
joy
enough
ah
have
no
fear
with
the
dawn
you
will
be
free
once
more
did
you
think
that
i
could
have
taken
your
sacrifice
i
knew
well
let
them
say
as
they
would
that
i
should
not
live
the
night
through
but
lest
existence
should
linger
to
curse
me
to
chain
you
i
rent
the
linen
bands
off
my
wounds
an
hour
ago
all
their
science
will
not
put
back
the
life
now
my
limbs
are
dead
and
the
cold
steals
up
ah
love
ah
love
you
never
thought
how
men
can
suffer
but
have
no
grief
for
me
i
am
happy
bend
your
head
down
and
lay
your
lips
on
mine
once
you
are
my
own
death
is
sweeter
than
life
and
before
sunrise
he
died
some
shadow
from
that
fatal
and
tragic
midnight
marriage
rested
on
her
still
though
she
was
blameless
some
vague
remorse
ever
haunted
her
though
she
had
been
so
wholly
guiltless
of
it
this
death
for
her
sake
ever
seemed
in
some
sort
of
her
bringing
men
thought
her
only
colder
only
prouder
but
they
erred
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
beneath
the
courtly
negligence
of
a
chill
manner
are
capable
of
infinite
tenderness
infinite
nobility
and
infinite
a
great
french
painter
once
in
rome
looking
on
her
from
a
distance
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
if
her
beauty
like
the
sun
dazzled
him
exquisite
superb
he
muttered
and
he
was
a
man
whose
own
ideals
were
so
matchless
that
living
women
rarely
could
wring
out
his
praise
she
is
nearly
perfect
your
princesse
corona
nearly
cried
a
roman
sculptor
what
in
heaven
name
can
she
want
only
one
thing
and
that
is
to
have
wherewith
he
turned
into
the
greco
he
had
found
the
one
flaw
and
it
was
still
there
what
he
missed
in
her
was
still
wanting
chapter
xxiii
the
little
leopard
of
france
ce
que
la
gloire
au
grabat
the
contemptuous
sentence
was
crushed
through
cigarette
lips
with
an
irony
sadder
than
tears
she
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
grabat
hard
as
wood
comfortless
as
a
truss
of
straw
and
looking
down
the
long
hospital
room
with
its
endless
rows
of
beds
and
its
hot
sun
shining
blindingly
on
its
glaring
whitewashed
walls
she
was
well
known
and
well
loved
there
when
her
little
figure
fluttered
like
some
scarlet
bird
of
africa
down
the
dreary
length
of
those
chambers
of
misery
bloodless
lips
in
torture
would
stir
with
a
smile
would
move
with
a
word
of
welcome
no
sister
of
orders
of
mercy
gliding
gray
and
soft
and
like
a
living
psalm
of
consolation
beside
those
couches
of
misery
bore
with
them
the
infinite
inexpressible
charm
that
the
friend
of
the
flag
brought
to
the
sufferers
the
sisters
were
good
were
gentle
were
valued
as
they
merited
by
the
greatest
blackguard
prostrate
there
but
they
never
smiled
they
never
took
the
dying
heart
of
a
man
back
with
one
glance
to
the
days
of
his
childhood
they
never
gave
a
sweet
wild
snatch
of
song
like
a
bird
on
a
bough
that
thrilled
through
senses
with
a
thousand
voices
from
a
thousand
buried
hours
but
the
little
one
as
said
a
gaunt
zephyr
once
where
he
lay
with
the
stealing
slowly
up
his
jagged
torn
frame
the
little
one
do
you
see
she
is
youth
she
is
life
she
is
all
we
have
lost
that
is
her
charm
the
sisters
are
good
women
they
are
very
good
but
they
only
pity
us
the
little
one
she
loves
us
that
is
the
difference
do
you
see
it
was
all
the
difference
a
wide
difference
she
loved
them
all
with
the
warmth
and
fire
of
her
young
heart
for
the
sake
of
france
and
of
their
common
flag
and
though
she
was
but
a
wild
wayward
mischievous
gamin
a
gamin
all
over
though
in
a
girl
form
men
would
tell
in
camp
and
hospital
with
great
tears
coursing
down
their
brown
scarred
cheeks
how
her
touch
would
lie
softly
as
a
snowflake
on
their
heated
foreheads
how
her
watch
would
be
kept
by
them
through
long
nights
of
torment
how
her
gifts
of
golden
trinkets
would
be
sold
or
pawned
as
soon
as
received
to
buy
them
ice
or
wine
and
how
in
their
delirium
the
sweet
fresh
voice
of
the
child
of
the
regiment
would
soothe
them
singing
above
their
wretched
beds
some
carol
or
chant
of
their
own
native
province
which
it
always
seemed
she
must
know
by
magic
for
were
it
basque
or
breton
were
it
a
of
vendee
or
a
of
the
orientales
were
it
a
mere
ringing
rhyme
for
the
mules
of
alsace
or
a
wild
bold
romanesque
from
the
country
of
berri
cigarette
knew
each
and
all
and
never
erred
by
any
chance
but
ever
sung
to
every
soldier
the
rhythm
familiar
from
his
infancy
the
melody
of
his
and
of
his
first
love
lips
and
there
had
been
times
when
those
songs
suddenly
breaking
through
the
darkness
of
night
suddenly
lulling
the
fiery
anguish
of
wounds
had
made
the
men
who
one
hour
before
had
been
like
mad
dogs
like
goaded
tigers
men
full
of
the
lusts
of
slaughter
and
the
lust
of
the
senses
and
chained
powerless
and
blaspheming
to
a
bed
of
agony
tremble
and
shudder
at
themselves
and
turn
their
faces
to
the
wall
and
weep
like
children
and
fall
asleep
at
length
with
wondering
dreams
of
god

now
grinding
her
pretty
teeth
she
was
in
her
most
revolutionary
and
reckless
mood
drumming
the
rataplan
with
her
spurred
heels
and
sitting
smoking
on
the
corner
of
old
mattress
who
had
acquired
that
title
among
the
joyeux
for
his
scientific
powers
of
making
a
tomcat
into
a
stew
so
divine
that
you
could
not
tell
it
from

ball
in

between

so
broken

one

just
so

pleasures
to
sweep
off

described
a
circle
with
his
lean
brawny
arm
with
as
infinite
a
relish
as

would
listen
thirstily

a
man
on

not
thirty
years
of
age
with
a
delicate
dark
beautiful
head
that
might
have
passed

the

rightly

the

the

his

up
on

up

the
misery
that

with
bleeding

under
burning

without

that
lies
through
the
long

with
but
one
care
to
keep
the

from

of
a
comrade
trust
that
is
beaten
like
the
mule
and
galled
like
the
horse
and
starved
like
the
camel
and
housed
like
the
dog
and
yet
does
the
thing
which
is
right
and
the
thing
which
is
brave
despite
all
that
suffers
and
endures
and
pours
out
his
blood
like
water
to
the
thirsty
sands
whose
thirst
is
never
stilled
and
goes
up
in
the
morning
sun
to
the
combat
as
though
death
were
paradise
that
the
arbicos
dream
knowing
the
while
that
no
paradise
waits
save
the
crash
of
the
hoof
through
the
throbbing
brain
or
the
roll
of
the
over
the
writhing
limb
that
is
glory
the
misery
that
is
heroism
because
france
needs
it
because
a
soldier
honor
wills
it
that
is
glory
it
is
here
in
the
hospital
as
it
never
is
in
the
cour
des
princes
where
the
glittering
host
of
the
marshals
gather
having
received
ardent
reproaches
from
field
officers
and
commanders
of
divisions
for
the
injustice
done
their
services
by
this
sentence
i
beg
to
assure
them
that
the
sentiment
is
cigarette
not
mine
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
an
instant
to
seem
to
depreciate
that
genius
of
command
without
whose
guidance
an
army
is
but
a
rabble
or
to
underrate
that
noblest
courage
which
accepts
the
burden
of
arduous
responsibilities
and
of
duties
as
bitter
in
anxiety
as
they
are
precious
in
honor
her
voice
rang
clear
as
a
clarion
the
warm
blood
burned
in
her
bright
cheeks
the
swift
fiery
pathetic
eloquence
of
her
nation
moved
her
and
moved
strangely
the
hearts
of
her
hearers
for
though
she
could
neither
read
nor
write
there
was
in
cigarette
the
germ
of
that
power
which
the
world
mistily
calls
genius
there
were
men
lying
in
that
brutalized
ignorant
as
the
bullocks
of
the
plains
and
like
them
reared
and
driven
for
the
slaughter
yet
there
was
not
one
among
them
to
whom
some
ray
of
light
failed
to
come
from
those
words
through
whom
some
thrill
failed
to
pass
as
they
heard
them
out
yonder
in
the
free
air
in
the
barrack
court
or
on
the
plains
the
little
one
would
rate
them
furiously
mock
them
mercilessly
rally
them
with
the
fist
of
a
saber
if
they
were
mutinous
and
lash
them
with
the
most
pitiless
ironies
if
they
were
grumbling
but
here
in
the
hospital
the
little
one
loved
them
and
they
knew
it
and
that
love
gave
a
music
to
the
passion
of
her
voice
then
she
laughed
and
drummed
the
rataplan
again
with
her
brass
heel
all
the
same
one
is
not
in
paradise
au
grabat
eh
pere
matou
she
said
curtly
she
was
half
impatient
of
her
own
momentary
lapse
into
enthusiasm
and
she
knew
the
temper
of
her
children
as
accurately
as
a
bugler
knows
the
notes
of
the
reveille
knew
that
they
loved
to
laugh
even
with
the
in
their
throats
and
with
their
hearts
half
breaking
over
a
comrade
corpse
would
cry
in
burlesque
mirth
ah
the
good
fellow
he
swallowed
his
own
cartouche
paradise
growled

that
if

few
bidons
of

now
brandy
oh
ha
you
are
to
be
much
more
of
aristocrats
now
than
that
cried
cigarette
with
an
immeasurable
satire
curling
on
her
rosy
piquant
lips
the
silver
pheasants
have
taken
to
patronize
you
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
touch
a
glass
nor
eat
a

you
will
not

spirit
of
a
rabbit
you
fed
like
dogs
with
the
leavings
of
her
table
pardieu
that

what

growled
peering
up
under
his
gray
shaggy
brows
only
that
a
grande
dame
has
sent
you
champagne
that
is
all
sapristi
how
easy
it
is
to
play
the
saint
and
samaritan
with
two
words
to
maitre
and
a
rouleau
of
gold
that
one
never
misses
the
rich
they
can
buy
all
things
you
see
even
heaven
so
cheap
with
which
withering
satire
cigarette
left
pere
matou
in
the
conviction
that
he
must
be
already
dead
and
among
the
angels
if
the
people
began
to
talk
of
champagne
to
him
and
flitting
down
between
the
long
rows
of
beds
with
the
old
disabled
veterans
who
tended
them
skimmed
her
way
like
a
bird
as
she
was
into
another
great
chamber
filled
like
the
first
with
suffering
in
all
stages
and
at
all
years
from
the
tossing
in
african
fever
to
the
campaigner
of
a
hundred
wounds
cigarette
was
as
caustic
as
a
voltaire
this
morning
coming
through
the
entrance
of
the
hospital
she
had
casually
heard
that
mme
la
princesse
corona
had
made
a
gift
of
singular
munificence
and
mercy
to
the
invalid
soldiers
a
gift
of
wine
of
fruit
of
flowers
that
would
brighten
their
long
dreary
hours
for
many
weeks
who
mme
la
princesse
might
be
she
knew
nothing
but
the
title
was
enough
she
was
a
silver
pheasant
bah
and
cigarette
hated
the
aristocrats
when
they
were
of
the
sex
feminine
an
aristocrat
in
adversity
is
an
eagle
she
would
say
but
an
aristocrat
in
prosperity
is
a
which
was
the
reason
why
she
flouted
glittering
young
nobles
with
all
the
insolence
imaginable
but
took
the
part
of
marquise
of
and
of
such
wanderers
like
them
who
had
buried
their
sixteen
quarterings
under
the
black
shield
of
the
battalion
of
africa
with
a
word
here
and
a
touch
there
tender
soft
and
bright
since
however
ironic
her
mood
she
never
brought
anything
except
sunshine
to
those
who
lay
in
such
sore
need
of
it
beholding
the
sun
in
the
heavens
only
through
the
narrow
chink
of
a
hospital
window
at
last
she
reached
the
bed
she
came
most
specially
to
visit
a
bed
on
which
was
stretched
the
emaciated
form
of
a
man
once
beautiful
as
a
greek
dream
of
a
god
the
dews
of
a
great
agony
stood
on
his
forehead
his
teeth
were
tight
clinched
on
lips
white
and
parched
and
his
immense
eyes
with
the
heavy
circles
round
them
were
fastened
on
vacancy
with
the
yearning
misery
that
gleams
in
the
eyes
of
a
spanish
bull
when
it
is
struck
again
and
again
by
the
matador
and
yet
can
not
die
she
bent
over
him
softly
tiens
leon
i
have
brought
you
some
his
weary
eyes
turned
on
her
gratefully
he
sought
to
speak
but
the
effort
brought
the
spasm
on
his
lungs
afresh
it
shook
him
with
horrible
violence
from
head
to
foot
and
the
foam
on
his
auburn
beard
was
red
with
blood
there
was
no
one
by
to
watch
him
he
was
sure
to
die
a
week
sooner
or
later
what
mattered
it
he
was
useless
as
a
soldier
good
only
to
be
thrown
into
a
pit
with
some
quicklime
to
hasten
destruction
and
do
the
work
of
the
slower
earthworms
cigarette
said
not
a
word
but
she
took
out
of
some
a
cold
hard
lump
of
ice
and
held
it
to
him
the
delicious
coolness
and
freshness
in
that
parching
noontide
heat
stilled
the
convulsion
his
eyes
thanked
her
though
his
lips
could
not
he
lay
panting
exhausted
but
relieved
and
she
thoughtfully
for
her
slid
herself
down
on
the
floor
and
began
singing
low
and
sweetly
as
a
fairy
might
sing
on
the
raft
of
a
leaf
she
sung
quadriales
to
be
sure
beranger
songs
and
odes
of
the
camp
for
she
knew
of
no
hymn
but
the
marseillaise
and
her
chants
were
all
chants
like
the
laus
but
the
voice
that
gave
them
was
pure
as
the
voice
of
a
thrush
in
the
spring
and
the
cadence
of
its
music
was
so
silvery
sweet
that
it
soothed
like
a
spell
all
the
brains
all
the
spirits
ah
that
is
sweet
murmured
the
dying
man
it
is
like
the
brooks
like
the
birds
like
the
winds
in
the
he
was
but
half
conscious
but
the
lulling
of
that
gliding
voice
brought
him
peace
and
cigarette
sung
on
only
moving
to
reach
him
some
fresh
touch
of
ice
while
time
traveled
on
and
the
first
afternoon
shadows
crept
across
the
bare
floor
every
now
and
then
dimly
through
the
openings
of
the
windows
came
a
distant
roll
of
drums
a
burst
of
military
music
an
echo
of
the
laughter
of
a
crowd
and
then
her
head
went
up
eagerly
an
impatient
shade
swept
across
her
expressive
face
it
was
a
in
algiers
there
were
flags
and
banners
fluttering
from
the
houses
there
were
arab
races
and
arab
maneuvers
there
was
a
review
of
troops
for
some
foreign
general
there
were
all
the
mirth
and
the
mischief
that
she
loved
and
that
never
went
on
without
her
and
she
knew
well
enough
that
from
mouth
to
mouth
there
was
sure
to
be
asking
mais
ou
done
est
cigarette
cigarette
who
was
the
generalissima
of
africa
but
still
she
never
moved
though
all
her
vivacious
life
was
longing
to
be
out
and
in
their
midst
on
the
back
of
a
desert
horse
on
the
head
of
a
huge
drum
perched
on
the
iron
support
of
a
lantern
standing
on
a
cannon
while
the
horse
artillery
swept
full
gallop
firing
down
a
volley
of
argot
on
the
hot
homage
of
a
hundred
lovers
drinking
creamy
liqueurs
and
filling
her
pockets
with
bonbons
from
handsome
subalterns
and
doing
as
she
had
done
ever
since
she
could
remember
her
first
rataplan
but
she
never
moved
she
knew
that
in
the
general
gala
these
would
be
left
more
deserted
and
less
soothed
than
ever
she
knew
too
that
it
was
for
the
sake
of
this
man
lying
dying
here
from
the
lunge
of
a
bedouin
lance
through
his
lungs
that
the
ivory
wreaths
and
crosses
and
statuettes
had
been
sold
and
cigarette
had
done
more
than
this
ere
now
many
a
time
for
her
the
day
stole
on
leon
ramon
lay
very
quiet
the
ice
for
his
chest
and
the
song
for
his
ear
gave
him
that
dreamy
and
comparatively
painless
which
was
the
only
mercy
which
could
come
to
him
all
the
chamber
was
unusually
still
on
three
of
the
beds
the
sheet
had
been
drawn
over
the
face
of
the
sleepers
who
had
sunk
to
a
last
sleep
since
the
morning
rose
the
shadows
lengthened
the
hours
followed
one
another
cigarette
sang
on
to
herself
with
few
pauses
whenever
she
did
so
pause
to
lay
soaked
linen
on
the
soldier
hot
forehead
or
to
tend
him
gently
in
those
paroxysms
that
wrenched
the
clotted
blood
from
off
his
lungs
there
was
a
light
on
her
face
that
did
not
come
from
the
golden
heat
of
the
african
sun
such
a
light
those
who
know
well
the
children
of
france
may
have
seen
in
battle
or
in
insurrection
grow
beautiful
upon
the
young
face
of
a
conscript
or
a
as
he
lifted
a
dying
comrade
or
pushed
to
the
front
to
be
slain
in
another
stead
the
face
that
a
moment
before
had
been
keen
for
the
slaughter
as
the
eyes
of
a
kite
and
recklessly
gay
as
the
saucy
refrain
the
lips
caroled
a
step
sounded
on
the
bare
boards
she
looked
up
and
the
wounded
man
raised
his
weary
lids
with
a
gleam
of
gladness
under
them
cecil
bent
above
his
couch
dear
leon
how
is
it
with
you
his
voice
was
softened
to
infinite
tenderness
leon
ramon
had
been
for
many
a
year
his
comrade
and
his
friend
an
artist
of
paris
a
man
of
marvelous
genius
of
high
idealic
creeds
who
in
a
fatal
moment
of
rash
despair
had
flung
his
talents
his
broken
fortunes
his
pure
and
noble
spirit
into
the
fiery
furnace
of
the
hell
of
military
africa
and
now
lay
dying
here
a
common
soldier
forgotten
as
though
he
were
already
in
his
grave
the
review
is
just
over
i
got
ten
minutes
to
spare
and
came
to
you
the
instant
i
could
pursued
cecil
see
here
what
i
bring
you
you
with
your
artist
soul
will
feel
yourself
all
but
well
when
you
look
on
these
he
spoke
with
a
hopefulness
he
could
never
feel
for
he
knew
that
the
life
of
leon
ramon
was
doomed
and
as
the
other
strove
to
gain
breath
enough
to
answer
him
he
gently
motioned
him
to
silence
and
placed
on
his
bed
some
peaches
bedded
deep
in
moss
and
circled
round
with
stephanotis
with
magnolia
with
roses
with
other
rarer
flowers
still
the
face
of
the
lightened
with
a
longing
joy
his
lips
quivered
ah
god
they
have
the
fragrance
of
my
france
cecil
said
nothing
but
moved
them
nearer
in
to
the
clasp
of
hie
eager
hands
cigarette
he
did
not
see
there
were
some
moments
of
silence
while
the
dark
eyes
of
the
dying
man
thirstily
dwelt
on
the
beauty
of
the
flowers
and
his
dry
ashen
lips
seemed
to
drink
in
their
perfumes
as
those
athirst
drink
in
water
they
are
beautiful
he
said
faintly
at
length
they
have
our
youth
in
them
how
came
you
by
them
dear
friend
they
are
not
due
to
me
answered
cecil
hurriedly
mme
la
princess
corona
sends
them
to
you
she
has
sent
great
gifts
to
the
hospital
wines
fruits
a
profusion
of
flowers
such
as
those
through
her
these
miserable
chambers
will
bloom
for
a
while
like
a
garden
and
the
best
wines
of
europe
will
slake
your
thirst
in
lieu
of
that
miserable
it
is
very
kind
murmured
leon
ramon
languidly
life
was
too
feeble
in
him
to
leave
him
vivid
pleasures
in
aught
but
i
am
ungrateful
la
cigarette
here
she
has
been
so
good
so
tender
so
pitiful
for
once
i
have
almost
not
missed
you
cigarette
thus
alluded
to
sprang
to
her
feet
with
her
head
tossed
back
and
all
her
cynicism
back
again
a
hot
color
was
on
her
cheeks
the
light
had
passed
from
her
face
she
struck
her
white
teeth
together
she
had
thought
chained
to
his
regiment
in
the
field
of
maneuver
or
she
would
never
have
come
thither
to
tend
his
friend
she
had
felt
happy
in
her
she
had
grown
into
a
gentle
pensive
merciful
mood
singing
here
by
the
side
of
the
dying
soldier
and
now
the
first
thing
she
heard
was
of
the
charities
of
mme
la
princesse
that
was
all
her
reward
cigarette
received
the
recompense
that
usually
comes
to
generous
natures
which
have
strung
themselves
to
some
that
costs
them
dear
cecil
looked
at
her
surprised
and
smiled
ma
belle
is
it
you
that
is
indeed
good
you
were
the
good
angel
of
my
life
the
other
night
and
come
to
bring
consolation
to
my
friend
good
angel
chut
victor
one
does
not
know
those
mots
sucres
in
algiers
there
is
nothing
of
the
angel
about
me
i
hope
your
friend
too
do
you
think
i
have
never
been
used
to
taking
care
of
my
comrades
in
hospital
before
you
played
the
here
she
spoke
with
all
her
brusque
petulance
in
arms
again
she
hated
that
he
should
imagine
she
had
sacrificed
her
to
leon
ramon
because
the
was
dear
to
him
she
hated
him
to
suppose
that
she
had
waited
there
all
the
hours
through
on
the
chance
that
he
would
find
her
at
her
post
and
admire
her
for
her
charity
cigarette
was
far
too
proud
and
disdainful
a
young
soldier
to
seek
either
his
presence
or
his
praise
he
smiled
again
he
did
not
understand
the
caprices
of
her
changeful
moods
and
he
did
not
feel
that
interest
in
her
which
would
have
made
him
divine
the
threads
of
their
vagaries
i
did
not
think
to
offend
you
my
little
one
he
said
gently
i
meant
only
to
thank
you
for
your
goodness
to
ramon
in
my
cigarette
shrugged
her
shoulders
there
was
no
goodness
and
there
need
be
no
thanks
ask
pere
matou
how
often
i
have
sat
with
him
hours
but
on
a
and
you
who
love
pleasure
and
grace
it
so
well
ouf
i
have
had
so
much
of

the

one
contemptuously
it
is
so
tame
to
me
clouds
of
dust
scurry
of
horses
fanfare
of
trumpets
thunder
of
drums
and
all
for
nothing
bah
i
have
been
in
a
dozen
battles
i
and
i
am
not
likely
to
care
much
for
a
sham
nay
she
is
unjust
to
herself
murmured
leon
ramon
she
gave
up
the
fete
to
do
this
mercy
it
has
been
a
great
one
she
is
more
generous
than
she
will
ever
allow
here
cigarette
look
at
these
scarlet
rosebuds
they
are
like
your
bright
cheeks
will
you
have
them
i
have
nothing
else
to
rosebuds
echoed
cigarette
with
supreme
scorn
rosebuds
for
me
i
know
no
rose
but
the
red
of
the
tricolor
and
i
could
not
tell
a
weed
from
a
flower
besides
i
told
just
now
if
my
children
do
as
i
tell
them
they
will
not
take
a
leaf
or
a
from
this
grande
dame
how
does
she
call
herself
mme
corona
cecil
looked
up
quickly
why
not
cigarette
flashed
on
him
her
brilliant
brown
eyes
with
a
fire
that
amazed
him
because
we
are
soldiers
not
paupers
surely
but
and
it
is
not
for
the
silver
pheasants
who
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
their
life
but
lain
in
nests
of
cotton
wool
and
eaten
grain
that
others
sow
and
shell
for
them
and
spread
their
shining
plumage
in
a
sun
that
never
clouds
above
their
heads
to
insult
with
the
insolence
of
their
and
their
the
heroes
of
france
who
perish
as
they
have
lived
for
their
country
and
their
flag
it
was
a
superb
peroration
if
the
hapless
flowers
lying
there
had
been
a
cartel
of
outrage
to
the
concrete
majesty
of
the
french
army
the
army
champion
could
not
have
spoken
with
more
impassioned
force
and
scorn
cecil
laughed
slightly
but
he
answered
with
a
certain
annoyance
there
is
no
here
no
question
of
it
mme
la
princesse
desired
to
offer
some
gift
to
the
soldiers
of
algiers
i
suggested
to
her
that
to
increase
the
scant
comforts
of
the
hospital
and
gladden
the
weary
eyes
of
sick
men
with
beauties
that
the
executive
never
dreams
of
bestowing
would
be
the
most
merciful
and
acceptable
mode
of
exercising
her
kindness
if
blame
there
be
in
the
matter
it
is
in
defending
the
generosity
of
what
he
knew
to
be
a
genuine
and
sincere
wish
to
gratify
his
comrades
he
betrayed
what
he
did
not
intend
to
have
revealed
namely
the
conversation
that
had
passed
between
himself
and
the
spanish
princesse
cigarette
caught
at
the
inference
with
the
quickness
of
her
thought
oh
ha
so
it
is
she
there
was
a
whole
world
of
emphasis
scorn
meaning
wrath
comprehension
and
irony
in
the
four
monosyllables
the
dying
man
looked
at
her
with
languid
wonder
she
who
what
story
goes
with
these
roses
none
said
cecil
with
the
same
inflection
of
annoyance
in
his
voice
to
have
his
passing
encounter
with
this
beautiful
patrician
pass
into
a
barrack
canard
through
the
unsparing
jests
of
the
soldiery
around
him
was
a
prospect
very
unwelcome
to
him
none
whatever
a
generous
thoughtfulness
for
our
common
necessities
as
soldiers
ouf
interrupted
cigarette
before
his
phrase
was
finished
the
stalled
mare
will
not
go
with
the
wild
coursers
an
aristocrat
may
live
with
us
but
he
will
always
cling
to
his
old
order
this
is
the
story
that
runs
with
the
roses
milady
was
languidly
insolent
over
some
ivory
chessmen
and
corporal
victor
thought
it
divine
because
languor
and
insolence
are
the
twin
gods
of
the
noblesse
parbleu
milady
knowing
no
gods
but
those
two
worships
them
and
sends
to
the
soldiers
of
france
as
the
sort
of
sacrifice
her
gods
love
fruits
and
wines
that
day
after
day
are
set
on
her
table
to
be
touched
if
tasted
at
all
with
a
butterfly
sip
and
corporal
victor
finds
this
a
charity
sublime
to
give
what
costs
nothing
and
scatter
a
few
crumbs
out
from
the
profusion
of
a
life
of
waste
and
indulgence
and
i
say
that
if
my
children
are
of
my
fashion
of
thinking
they
will
choke
like
dogs
dying
of
thirst
rather
than
slake
their
throats
with
alms
cast
to
them
as
if
they
were
beggars
with
which
fiery
and
bitter
enunciation
of
her
views
on
the
gifts
of
the
princesse
corona
cigarette
struck
light
to
her
and
thrusting
it
between
her
lips
with
her
hands
in
the
folds
of
her
scarlet
went
off
with
the
light
swift
step
natural
to
her
exaggerated
into
the
carriage
she
had
learned
of
the
zouaves
laughing
her
noisily
to
this
and
that
trooper
as
she
passed
their
couches
and
not
dropping
her
voice
even
as
she
passed
the
place
where
the
dead
lay
but
singing
as
loud
as
she
could
the
most
impudent
out
of
the
taverns
of
the
spahis
that
ever
celebrated
wine
women
and
war
in
the
lawlessness
of
the
lingua
sabir
her
wrath
was
hot
and
her
heart
heavy
within
her
she
had
given
up
her
whole
to
wait
on
the
anguish
and
to
soothe
the
solitude
of
his
friend
lying
dying
there
and
her
reward
had
been
to
hear
him
speak
of
this
aristocrat
donations
that
cost
her
nothing
but
the
trouble
of
a
few
words
of
command
to
her
household
as
though
they
were
the
saintly
charities
of
some
angel
from
heaven
diantre
she
muttered
as
her
hand
wandered
to
the
forms
of
the
pistols
within
her
sash
any
of
them
would
throw
a
draught
of
wine
in
his
face
and
lay
him
dead
for
me
with
a
pass
or
two
ten
minutes
after
why
do
i
bid
them
i
have
a
mind
in
that
moment
she
could
have
shot
him
dead
herself
without
a
thought
storm
and
sunlight
swept
one
after
another
with
electrical
rapidity
at
all
times
through
her
vivid
changeful
temper
and
here
she
had
been
wounded
and
been
stung
in
the
very
hour
in
which
she
had
subdued
her
national
love
of
mirth
and
her
childlike
passion
for
show
and
her
impatience
of
all
confinement
and
her
hatred
of
all
things
mournful
in
the
attainment
of
this
moreover
there
mingled
with
it
the
fierce
and
intolerant
heat
of
the
passionate
and
jealousy
of
an
utterly
untamed
nature
and
of
gallic
blood
quick
and
hot
as
the
steaming
springs
of
the
geyser
you
have
vexed
her
victor
said
leon
ramon
as
she
was
lost
to
sight
through
the
doors
of
the
great
desolate
chamber
i
hope
not
i
do
not
know
how
answered
cecil
it
is
impossible
to
follow
the
windings
of
her
wayward
caprices
a
child
a
soldier
a
dancer
a
brigand
a
spoiled
beauty
a
mischievous
gamin
how
is
one
to
treat
such
a
little
fagot
of
opposites
the
others
smiled
ah
you
do
not
know
the
little
one
yet
she
is
worth
a
study
i
painted
her
years
ago
vivandiere
a
sept
ans
there
was
not
a
picture
in
the
salon
that
winter
that
was
sought
like
it
i
had
traveled
in
algeria
then
i
had
not
entered
the
army
the
first
thing
i
saw
of
cigarette
was
this
she
was
seven
years
old
she
had
been
beaten
black
and
blue
she
had
had
two
of
her
tiny
teeth
knocked
out
the
men
were
furious
she
was
a
pet
with
them
and
she
would
not
say
who
had
done
it
though
she
knew
twenty
swords
would
have
beaten
him
flat
as
a
fritter
if
she
had
given
his
name
i
got
her
to
sit
to
me
some
days
after
i
pleased
her
with
her
own
picture
i
asked
her
to
tell
me
why
she
would
not
say
who
had
her
she
put
her
head
on
one
side
like
a
robin
and
told
me
in
a
whisper
was
one
of
my
comrades
because
i
would
not
steal
for
him
i
would
not
have
the
army
know
it
would
demoralize
them
if
a
french
soldier
ever
does
a
cowardly
thing
another
french
soldier
must
not
betray
it
that
was
cigarette
at
seven
years
the
esprit
de
corps
was
stronger
than
her
own
wrongs
what
do
you
say
to
that
nature
that
is
superb
that
it
might
be
molded
to
anything
the
pity
is
ah
said
the
half
wearily
half
laughingly
spare
me
the
old
threadbare
formulas
because
the
flax
and
the
laleza
blossom
for
use
and
the
garden
flowers
grow
trained
and
pruned
must
there
be
no
bud
that
opens
for
mere
love
of
the
sun
and
swings
free
in
the
wind
in
its
fearless
fair
fashion
believe
me
dear
victor
it
is
the
lives
which
follow
no
previous
rule
that
do
the
most
good
and
give
the
most
surely
only
for
this
child
a
woman
in
her
future
her
future
well
she
will
die
i
dare
say
some
bright
day
or
another
at
the
head
of
a
regiment
with
some
desperate
battle
turned
by
the
valor
of
her
charge
and
the
sight
of
the
torn
tricolor
upheld
in
her
little
hands
that
is
what
cigarette
hopes
for
why
not
there
will
always
be
a
million
of
commonplace
women
ready
to
keep
up
the
decorous
traditions
of
their
sex
and
sit
in
safety
over
their
needles
by
the
side
of
their
hearths
one
little
lioness
here
and
there
in
a
generation
can
not
do
overmuch
cecil
was
silent
he
would
not
cross
the
words
of
the
wounded
man
by
saying
what
might
bring
a
train
of
less
pleasant
thoughts
saying
what
in
truth
was
in
his
mind
that
the
future
which
he
had
meant
for
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
was
not
that
of
any
glorious
death
by
combat
but
that
of
a
life
unless
no
bullet
early
cut
its
silver
cord
in
twain
when
youth
should
have
fled
and
have
carried
forever
with
it
her
numberless
graces
and
left
in
its
stead
that
hardened
battered
joyless
cruel
terrible
thing
which
is
unsightly
and
repugnant
to
even
the
lowest
among
men
which
is
as
the
lees
of
the
drunk
wine
as
the
ashes
of
the
fires
as
the
discord
of
the
broken
and
lyre
cigarette
was
charming
now
a
set
into
living
motion
a
fantastic
little
firework
out
of
an
extravaganza
with
the
impudence
of
a
and
the
witching
of
a
girl
beauty
but
when
this
youth
that
made
it
all
fair
should
have
passed
and
youth
passes
soon
when
thus
adrift
on
the
world
when
there
should
be
left
in
its
stead
only
shamelessness
hardihood
vice
weariness
those
who
found
the
prettiest
jest
in
her
now
would
be
the
first
to
cast
aside
with
an
oath
the
charred
wrecked
of
a
life
from
which
no
golden
careless
stream
of
fires
of
coquette
caprices
would
rise
and
enchant
them
then
who
is
it
that
sent
these
asked
leon
ramon
later
on
as
his
hands
still
wandered
among
the
flowers
for
the
moment
he
was
at
peace
the
ice
and
the
hours
of
quietude
had
calmed
him
cecil
told
him
again
what
does
cigarette
know
of
her
he
pursued
nothing
except
i
believe
she
knew
that
mme
corona
accepted
my
ah
i
thought
the
little
one
was
jealous
jealous
pshaw
of
whom
of
anyone
you
admire
especially
of
this
grande
absurd
said
cecil
with
a
sense
of
annoyance
cigarette
is
far
too
bold
a
little
trooper
to
have
any
thoughts
of
those
follies
and
as
for
this
grande
dame
as
you
call
her
i
shall
in
every
likelihood
never
see
her
again
unless
when
the
word
is
given
to
swords
or
at
the
general
salute
where
she
reins
her
horse
beside
le
marechal
at
a
review
as
i
have
done
this
the
keen
ear
of
the
sick
man
caught
the
inflection
of
an
impatience
of
a
mortification
in
the
tone
that
the
speaker
himself
was
unconscious
of
he
guessed
the
truth
that
cecil
had
never
felt
more
restless
under
the
shadow
of
the
eagles
than
he
had
done
when
he
had
carried
his
sword
up
in
the
salute
as
he
passed
with
his
regiment
the
flagstaff
where
the
aristocracy
of
algiers
had
been
gathered
about
the
marshal
and
his
staff
and
the
azure
eyes
of
mme
la
princesse
had
glanced
carelessly
and
critically
over
the
long
line
of
gray
horses
of
those
chasseurs
among
whom
he
rode
a
cigarette
is
right
said
ramon
with
a
slight
smile
your
heart
is
with
your
old
order
you
are
an
indeed
i
am
not
mon
ami
i
am
a
mere
now
well
keep
your
history
as
you
have
always
done
if
you
will
what
my
friend
was
matters
nothing
i
know
well
what
he
is
and
how
true
a
friend
as
for
milady
she
will
be
best
out
of
your
path
victor
women
god
they
are
so
fatal
does
not
our
folly
make
their
fatality
not
always
not
often
the
madness
may
be
ours
but
they
sow
it
ah
do
they
not
know
how
to
rouse
and
enrage
it
how
to
fan
to
burn
to
lull
to
pierce
to
slake
to
inflame
to
entice
to
sting
heavens
so
well
they
know
that
their
beauty
must
come
one
thinks
out
of
hell
itself
his
great
eyes
gleamed
like
fire
his
hollow
chest
panted
for
breath
the
sweat
stood
out
on
his
temples
cecil
sought
to
soothe
him
but
his
words
rushed
on
with
the
impetuous
course
of
the
passionate
memories
that
arose
in
him
do
you
know
what
brought
me
here
no
as
little
as
i
know
what
brought
you
though
we
have
been
close
comrades
all
these
years
well
it
was
she
i
was
an
artist
i
had
no
money
i
had
few
friends
but
i
had
youth
i
had
ambition
i
had
i
think
genius
till
she
killed
it
i
loved
my
art
with
a
great
love
and
i
was
happy
even
in
paris
one
can
be
so
happy
without
wealth
while
one
is
young
the
mirth
of
the
barriere
the
grotesques
of
the
halles
the
wooden
booths
on
new
day
the
bright
midnight
crowds
under
the
gaslights
the
bursts
of
music
from
the
gay
cafes
the
gray
little
nuns
flitting
through
the
snow
the
mardi
gras
and
the
fooleries
the
summer
sundays
under
the
leaves
while
we
laughed
like
children
the
silent
dreams
through
the
length
of
the
louvre
dreams
that
went
home
with
us
and
made
our
garret
bright
with
their
visions
one
was
happy
in
them
happy
happy
his
eyes
were
still
fastened
on
the
blank
white
wall
before
him
while
he
spoke
as
though
the
things
that
his
words
sketched
so
faintly
were
painted
in
all
their
vivid
colors
on
the
dull
blank
surface
and
so
in
truth
they
were
as
remembrance
pictured
all
the
thousand
perished
hours
of
his
youth
happy
until
she
looked
at
me
he
pursued
while
his
voice
flew
in
feverish
haste
over
the
words
why
would
she
not
let
me
be
she
had
them
all
in
her
golden
nets
nobles
and
princes
and
poets
and
soldiers
she
swept
them
in
far
and
wide
she
had
her
empire
why
must
she
seek
out
a
man
who
had
but
his
art
and
his
youth
and
steal
those
women
are
so
insatiate
look
you
though
they
held
all
the
world
they
would
not
rest
if
one
mote
in
the
air
swam
in
sunshine
free
of
them
it
was
the
first
year
i
touched
triumph
that
i
saw
her
they
began
for
the
first
time
to
speak
of
me
it
was
the
little
painting
of
cigarette
as
a
child
of
the
army
that
did
it
ah
god
i
thought
myself
already
so
famous
well
she
sent
for
me
to
take
her
picture
and
i
went
i
went
and
i
painted
her
as
cleopatra
by
her
wish
ah
it
was
a
face
for
cleopatra
the
eyes
that
burn
your
youth
dead
the
lips
that
kiss
your
honor
blind
a
face
my
god
how
beautiful
she
had
set
herself
to
gain
my
soul
and
as
the
picture
grew
and
grew
and
grew
so
my
life
grew
into
hers
till
i
lived
only
by
her
breath
why
did
she
want
my
life
she
had
so
many
she
had
rich
lives
great
lives
grand
lives
at
her
bidding
and
yet
she
knew
no
rest
till
she
had
leaned
down
from
her
cruel
height
and
had
seized
mine
that
had
nothing
on
earth
but
the
joys
of
the
sun
and
the
dew
and
the
falling
of
night
and
the
dawning
of
day
that
are
given
to
the
birds
of
the
his
chest
heaved
with
the
spasms
that
with
each
throe
seemed
to
tear
his
frame
asunder
still
he
conquered
them
and
his
words
went
on
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
burning
white
glare
of
the
wall
as
though
all
the
beauty
of
this
woman
glowed
afresh
there
to
his
sight
she
was
great
no
matter
her
name
she
lives
still
she
was
vile
aye
but
not
in
my
sight
till
too
late
why
is
it
that
the
heart
which
is
pure
never
makes
ours
beat
upon
it
with
the
rapture
sin
gives
through
month
on
month
my
picture
grew
and
my
passion
grew
with
it
fanned
by
her
hand
she
knew
that
never
would
a
man
paint
her
beauty
like
one
who
gave
his
soul
for
the
price
of
success
i
had
my
paradise
i
was
drunk
and
i
painted
as
never
the
colors
of
mortals
painted
a
woman
i
think
even
she
was
content
even
she
who
in
her
superb
arrogance
thought
she
was
matchless
and
deathless
then
came
my
reward
when
the
picture
was
done
her
fancy
had
changed
a
light
scorn
a
careless
laugh
a
touch
of
her
fan
on
my
cheek
could
i
not
understand
was
i
still
such
a
child
must
i
be
broken
more
harshly
in
to
learn
to
give
place
that
was
all
and
at
last
her
lackey
pushed
me
back
with
his
wand
from
her
gates
what
would
you
i
had
not
known
what
a
great
lady
illicit
caprices
meant
i
was
still
but
a
boy
she
had
killed
me
she
had
struck
my
genius
dead
she
had
made
earth
my
hell
what
of
that
she
had
her
beauty
eternal
in
the
picture
she
needed
and
the
whole
city
rang
with
her
loveliness
as
they
looked
on
my
work
i
have
never
painted
again
i
came
here
what
of
that
an
artist
the
less
then
the
world
did
not
care
a
life
the
less
soon
she
will
not
care
either
then
as
the
words
ended
a
great
wave
of
blood
beat
back
his
breath
and
burst
from
the
torture
of
his
striving
lungs
and
stained
red
the
dark
and
silken
masses
of
his
beard
his
comrade
had
seen
the
hemorrhage
many
times
yet
now
he
knew
as
he
had
never
known
before
that
that
was
death
as
he
held
him
upward
in
his
arms
and
shouted
loud
for
help
the
great
luminous
eyes
of
the
french
soldier
looked
up
at
him
through
their
mist
with
the
deep
fond
gratitude
that
beams
in
the
eyes
of
a
dog
as
it
drops
down
to
die
knowing
one
touch
and
one
voice
to
the
last
you
do
not
forsake
he
murmured
brokenly
while
his
voice
ebbed
faintly
away
as
the
stream
of
his
life
flowed
faster
and
faster
out
it
is
over
now
so
best
if
only
i
could
have
seen
france
once
more
france
he
stretched
his
arms
outward
as
he
spoke
with
the
vain
longing
of
a
hopeless
love
then
a
deep
sigh
quivered
through
his
lips
his
hand
strove
to
close
on
the
hand
of
his
comrade
and
his
head
fell
resting
on
the
flushed
blossoms
of
the
of
provence
he
was
dead
an
hour
later
cecil
left
the
hospital
seeing
and
hearing
nothing
of
the
gay
riot
of
the
town
about
him
though
the
folds
of
silk
and
bunting
fluttered
across
the
narrow
moorish
streets
and
the
whole
of
the
populace
was
swarming
through
them
with
the
vivacious
enjoyment
of
paris
mingling
with
the
stately
picturesque
life
of
arab
habit
and
custom
he
was
well
used
to
pain
of
every
sort
his
bread
had
long
been
the
bread
of
bitterness
and
the
waters
of
his
draught
been
of
gall
yet
this
stroke
though
looked
for
fell
heavily
and
cut
far
yonder
in
the
deadroom
there
lay
a
broken
useless
mass
of
flesh
and
bone
that
in
the
sight
of
the
bureau
arabe
was
only
a
machine
that
had
paid
its
due
toll
to
the
wars
of
the
second
empire
and
was
now
valueless
only
fit
to
be
cast
in
to
rot
unmourned
in
the
devouring
african
soil
but
to
him
that
lifeless
useless
mass
was
dear
still
was
the
wreck
of
the
bravest
tenderest
and
friend
that
he
had
found
in
his
adversity
in
leon
ramon
he
had
found
a
man
whom
he
had
loved
and
who
had
loved
him
they
had
suffered
much
and
much
endured
together
their
very
dissimilarities
had
seemed
to
draw
them
nearer
to
each
other
the
gentle
impassiveness
of
the
englishman
had
been
like
rest
to
the
ardent
impetuosity
of
the
french
soldier
the
passionate
and
poetic
temperament
of
the
had
revealed
to
cecil
a
thousand
views
of
thought
and
of
feeling
which
had
never
before
then
dawned
on
him
and
now
that
the
one
lay
dead
a
heavy
weary
sense
of
loneliness
rested
on
the
other
they
died
around
him
every
day
the
fearless
fiery
blood
of
france
watered
in
ceaseless
streams
the
arid
harvestless
fields
of
northern
africa
death
was
so
common
that
the
fall
of
a
comrade
was
no
more
noted
by
them
than
the
fall
of
a
loose
stone
that
their
foot
shook
down
a
precipice
yet
this
death
was
very
bitter
to
him
he
wondered
with
a
dull
sense
of
aching
impatience
why
no
bedouin
bullet
no
arab
saber
had
ever
found
his
own
life
out
and
cut
his
thralls
asunder
the
evening
had
just
followed
on
the
glow
of
the
day
evening
more
lustrous
even
than
ever
for
the
houses
were
all
aglitter
with
endless
lines
of
colored
lamps
and
strings
of
sparkling
illuminations
a
very
sea
of
fire
the
noise
the
mirth
the
sudden
swell
of
music
the
crowds
all
that
were
about
him
served
only
to
make
more
desolate
and
more
oppressive
by
their
contrast
his
memories
of
that
life
once
gracious
and
gifted
and
content
with
the
dower
of
its
youth
ruined
by
a
woman
and
now
slaughtered
here
for
no
avail
and
with
no
honor
by
a
in
a
midnight
skirmish
which
had
been
unrecorded
even
in
the
few
lines
of
the
gazette
that
chronicled
the
war
news
of
algeria
passing
one
of
the
cafes
a
favorite
resort
of
the
officers
of
his
own
regiment
he
saw
cigarette
a
sheaf
of
blue
and
white
and
scarlet
lights
flashed
with
tongues
of
golden
flame
over
her
head
and
a
great
tricolor
flag
with
the
brass
eagle
above
it
was
hanging
in
the
still
hot
air
from
the
balcony
from
which
she
leaned
her
was
full
of
bonbons
and
crackers
that
she
was
flinging
down
among
the
crowd
while
she
sang
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
exchange
some
passage
of
gaulois
wit
with
them
that
made
her
hearers
scream
with
laughter
while
behind
her
was
a
throng
of
young
officers
drinking
champagne
eating
ices
and
smoking
echoing
her
songs
and
her
satires
with
enthusiastic
voices
and
stamps
of
their
spurred
bootheels
as
he
glanced
upward
she
looked
literally
in
a
blaze
of
luminance
and
the
wild
mellow
tones
of
her
voice
ringing
out
sounded
like
a
mockery
of
that
beside
which
they
had
both
so
late
stood
together
she
has
the
playfulness
of
the
young
leopard
and
the
cruelty
he
thought
with
a
sense
of
disgust
forgetting
that
she
did
not
know
what
he
knew
and
that
if
cigarette
had
waited
to
laugh
until
death
had
passed
by
she
would
have
never
laughed
all
her
life
through
in
the
battalions
of
africa
she
saw
him
as
he
went
beneath
her
balcony
and
she
sung
all
the
louder
she
flung
her
sweetmeat
missiles
with
reckless
force
she
launched
bolts
of
tenfold
more
audacious
raillery
at
the
delighted
mob
below
cigarette
was
bon
soldat
when
she
was
wounded
she
wound
her
scarf
round
the
nerve
that
ached
and
only
laughed
the
gayer
and
he
did
her
that
injustice
which
the
best
among
us
are
apt
to
do
to
those
whom
we
do
not
feel
interest
enough
in
to
study
with
that
closeness
which
can
alone
give
comprehension
of
the
intricate
and
complex
rebus
so
faintly
sketched
so
marvelously
involved
of
human
nature
he
thought
her
a
little
leopard
in
her
vivacious
play
and
her
inborn
bloodthirstiness
well
the
little
leopard
of
france
played
recklessly
enough
that
evening
algiers
was
en
fete
and
cigarette
was
sparkling
over
the
whole
of
the
town
like
a
or
a
firefly
here
and
there
and
everywhere
in
a
thousand
places
at
once
as
it
seemed
staying
long
with
none
making
music
and
mirth
with
all
waltzing
like
a
thing
possessed
pelting
her
lovers
with
a
tempest
storm
of
dragees
standing
on
the
head
of
a
gigantic
spahi
en
tableau
amid
a
shower
of
fireworks
improvising
slang
songs
and
chorused
by
a
hundred
lusty
lungs
that
yelled
the
burden
in
riotous
glee
as
furiously
as
they
were
accustomed
to
shout
en
avant
in
assault
and
in
charge
cigarette
made
amends
to
herself
at
night
for
her
vain
of
the
she
had
her
wound
yes
it
throbbed
still
now
and
then
and
stung
like
a
bee
in
the
warm
core
of
a
rose
but
she
was
young
she
was
gay
she
was
a
little
philosopher
above
all
she
was
french
and
in
the
real
french
blood
happiness
runs
so
richly
that
it
will
hardly
be
utterly
chilled
until
the
veins
freeze
in
the
coldness
of
death
she
enjoyed
enjoyed
all
the
more
fiercely
perhaps
because
a
certain
desperate
bitterness
mingled
with
the
abandonment
of
her
queen
revelries
until
now
cigarette
had
been
as
absolutely
heedless
and
without
a
care
as
any
young
bird
taking
its
first
summer
circles
downward
through
the
intoxication
of
the
sunny
air
it
was
not
without
fiery
resistance
and
scornful
revolt
that
the
madcap
would
be
prevailed
on
to
admit
that
any
shadow
could
have
power
to
rest
on
her
she
played
through
more
than
half
the
night
with
the
agile
bounding
graceful
play
of
the
young
leopard
to
which
he
had
likened
her
and
with
a
quick
punishment
from
her
talons
if
any
durst
offend
her
then
when
the
dawn
was
nigh
the
little
one
sought
her
den
she
was
most
commonly
under
canvas
but
when
she
was
in
town
it
was
at
one
with
the
proud
independence
of
her
nature
that
she
rejected
all
offers
made
her
and
would
have
her
own
nook
to
live
in
even
though
she
were
not
there
one
hour
out
of
the
le
chateau
de
cigarette
was
a
standing
jest
of
the
army
for
none
was
ever
allowed
to
follow
her
thither
or
to
behold
the
interior
of
her
fortress
and
one
overventurous
spahi
scaling
the
ramparts
had
been
rewarded
with
so
hot
a
deluge
of
lentil
soup
from
a
boiling
casserole
poured
on
his
head
from
above
that
he
had
beaten
a
hasty
and
ignominious
retreat
which
was
more
than
a
whole
tribe
of
the
most
warlike
of
his
countrymen
could
ever
have
made
him
do
le
chateau
de
cigarette
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
couple
of
garrets
high
in
the
air
in
an
old
moorish
house
in
an
old
moorish
court
decayed
silent
with
the
wild
pumpkin
thrusting
its
leaves
through
the
broken
fretwork
and
the
green
lizard
shooting
over
the
broad
pavements
once
brilliant
in
mosaic
that
the
robe
of
the
princes
of
islam
had
swept
now
carpeted
deep
with
the
dry
white
drifted
dust
and
only
crossed
by
the
tottering
feet
of
aged
jews
or
the
laden
steps
of
algerine
women
up
a
long
winding
rickety
stair
cigarette
approached
her
castle
which
was
very
near
the
sky
indeed
i
like
the
blue
said
the
chatelaine
laconically
and
the
pigeons
fly
close
by
my
and
through
it
too
she
might
have
added
for
though
no
human
thing
might
invade
her
chateau
the
pigeons
circling
in
the
sunrise
light
always
knew
well
there
were
rice
and
crumbs
spread
for
them
in
that
of
a
casement
cigarette
threaded
her
agile
way
up
the
dark
shaft
and
opened
her
door
there
was
a
dim
oil
wick
burning
the
garret
was
large
and
as
clean
as
a
palace
could
be
its
occupants
were
various
and
all
sound
asleep
except
one
who
rough
and
hard
and
small
and
limped
up
to
her
and
rubbed
a
little
bullet
head
against
her
lovingly
bouffarick
petite
bouffarick
returned
cigarette
caressingly
in
a
whisper
and
bouffarick
content
limped
back
to
a
nest
of
hay
being
a
little
wiry
dog
that
had
lost
a
leg
in
one
of
the
most
famous
battles
of
oran
and
lain
in
its
dead
master
breast
through
three
days
and
nights
on
the
field
cigarette
shading
the
lamp
with
one
hand
glanced
round
on
her
family
they
had
all
histories
histories
in
the
french
army
which
was
the
only
history
she
considered
of
any
import
to
the
universe
there
was
a
raven
perched
high
by
name
he
was
a
noted
character
among
the
zouaves
and
had
made
many
a
campaign
riding
on
his
owner
bayonet
he
loved
a
combat
and
was
specially
famed
for
screaming
tue
tue
tue
all
over
a
battlefield
he
was
very
gray
now
and
the
zouave
bones
had
long
bleached
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
there
was
a
tame
rat
who
was
a
vieille
moustache
and
who
had
lived
many
years
in
a
lignard
pocket
and
munched
waifs
and
strays
of
the
military
rations
until
the
enormous
crime
being
discovered
that
it
was
taught
to
sit
up
and
dress
its
whiskers
to
the
heinous
air
of
the
marseillaise
the
lignard
got
the
stick
and
the
rat
was
condemned
to
be
killed
had
not
cigarette
dashed
in
to
the
rescue
and
carried
the
revolutionist
off
in
safety
there
was
a
big
white
cat
curled
in
a
ball
who
had
been
the
darling
of
a
tringlo
and
had
traveled
all
over
north
africa
on
the
top
of
his
mule
back
seven
seasons
through
in
the
eighth
the
tringlo
was
picked
off
by
a
flying
shot
and
an
indigene
was
about
to
skin
the
shrieking
cat
for
the
when
a
bullet
broke
his
wrist
making
him
drop
the
cat
with
a
yell
of
pain
and
the
friend
of
the
flag
catching
it
up
laughed
in
his
face
a
lead
comfit
instead
of
my
friend
there
were
little
bouffarick
and
three
other
of
equal
celebrity
one
in
especial
who
had
been
brought
from
chalons
in
defiance
of
the
regulations
inside
the
drum
of
his
regiment
and
had
been
wounded
a
dozen
times
always
seeking
the
hottest
heat
of
the
skirmish
and
there
was
besides
these
sleeping
serenely
on
straw
a
very
old
man
with
a
snowy
beard
a
very
old
man
one
who
had
been
a
conscript
in
the
bands
of
young
france
and
marched
from
his
pyrenean
village
to
the
battle
tramp
of
the
marseillaise
and
charged
with
the
enfants
de
paris
across
the
plains
who
had
known
the
passage
of
the
alps
and
lifted
the
long
curls
from
the
dead
brow
of
dessaix
at
marengo
and
seen
in
the
sultry
noonday
dust
of
a
glorious
summer
the
guard
march
into
paris
while
the
people
laughed
and
wept
with
joy
surging
like
the
mighty
sea
around
one
pale
frail
form
so
young
by
years
so
absolute
by
genius
a
very
old
man
long
broken
with
poverty
with
pain
with
bereavement
with
extreme
old
age
and
by
a
long
course
of
cruel
accidents
alone
here
in
africa
without
one
left
of
the
friends
of
his
youth
or
of
the
children
of
his
name
and
deprived
even
of
the
charities
due
from
his
country
to
his
services
alone
save
for
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
who
for
four
years
had
kept
him
on
the
proceeds
of
her
wine
trade
in
this
moorish
attic
tending
him
herself
when

curtly
when
she
had
found
him
in
great
misery
and
learned
his
history
from
others
and
she
had
had
the

accordingly
maintaining
him
at
her
own
cost
in
the
moorish

and
paying
a
good

of

tend
him
when
she
was

the

almost
dead
mentally
though
in
bodily
strength
still
well
able
to
know
the
physical
comforts
of
food
and
rest
and
attendance
he
was
in
his
second
childhood
in
his
ninetieth
year
and
was
unconscious
of
the
debt
he
owed
her
even
with
a
curious
caprice
of
decrepitude
he
disliked
her
and
noticed
nothing
except
the
raven
when
it
shrieked
its
tue

but
to

he
was
as
sacred
as
a

he
not
fought
beneath
the

and
gazed
upon
the
face
of
the
first
consul
she
bent
over
him
now
saw
that
he
slept
busied
herself
noiselessly
in
brewing
a
little
tin
pot
full
of
coffee
and
hot
milk
set
it
over
the
lamp
to
keep
it
warm
and
placed
it
beside
him
ready
for
his
morning
meal
with
a
roll
of
white
wheat

then
with
a
glance
round
to
see
that
her
other
dependents
wanted
for
nothing
went
to
her
own
garret
adjoining
and
with
the
lattice
fastened
back
that
the
first
rays
of
sunrise
and
the
first
white
flash
of
her
friends
the
pigeons
gleaming
wings
might
awaken
her
threw
herself
on
her
straw
and
slept
with
all
the
graceful
careless
rest
of
the
childhood
which
though
in
once
sense
she
had
never
known
yet
in
another
had
never
forsaken
her
she
hid
as
her
lawless
courage
would
not
have
stooped
to

a
sin

she
chosen
to
commit

compassion
which
she
the
young

showed
with
so
tender
a
charity
to
the
soldier
of

to
him
moreover
her
fiery
imperious
voice
was
gentle
as
the
dove
her
wayward
dominant
will
was
pliant
as
the
reed
her
contemptuous
skeptic
spirit
was
reverent
as
a
child
before
an
altar
in
her
sight
the
survivor
of
the
army
of

was
sacred
sacred
the
eyes
which
when
full

had
seen
the

glitter
on

the
hussars
of

early
that
morning
when
the
snowy
cloud
of

were
circling
down
to
take
their
daily
alms
from

where
her
bright
brown
face
looked
out
from

with
some
of
the
roughriders
of
his
regiment
was
sent
far
into
the
interior
to
bring
in
a
string
of
colts
bought
of
a
friendly
desert
tribe
and
destined
to
be
shipped
to
france
for
the
imperial
haras
the
mission
took
two
days
early
on
the
third
day
they
returned
with
the
string
of
wild
young
horses
whom
it
had
taken
not
a
little
exertion
and
address
to
conduct
successfully
through
the
country
into
algiers
he
was
usually
kept
in
incessant
activity
because
those
in
command
over
him
had
quickly
discovered
the
immeasurable
value
of
a
who
was
certain
to
enforce
and
obtain
implicit
obedience
and
certain
to
execute
any
command
given
him
with
perfect
address
and
surety
yet
who
at
the
same
time
was
adored
by
his
men
and
had
acquired
a
most
singularly
advantageous
influence
over
them
but
of
this
he
was
always
glad
throughout
his
twelve
years
service
under
the
emperor
flag
he
had
only
found
those
moments
in
which
he
was
unemployed
intolerable
he
would
willingly
have
been
in
the
saddle
from
dawn
till
midnight
chateauroy
was
himself
present
when
the
colts
were
taken
into
the
and
himself
inquired
without
the
medium
of
any
third
person
the
whole
details
of
the
sale
and
of
the
transit
it
was
impossible
with
all
his
inclination
to
find
any
fault
either
with
the
execution
of
the
errand
or
with
the
brief
respectful
answers
by
which
his
corporal
replied
to
his
rapid
and
imperious
there
were
a
great
number
of
men
within
hearing
many
of
them
the
most
daring
and
rebellious
pratiques
of
the
regiment
and
cecil
would
have
let
the
coarsest
upbraidings
scourge
him
rather
than
put
the
temptation
to
mutiny
in
their
way
which
one
insubordinate
or
even
not
strictly
deferential
word
from
him
would
have
given
hence
the
inspection
passed
off
peaceably
as
the
marquis
turned
on
his
heel
however
he
paused
a
moment

are
to

sir

put
out
his
hand
he
expected
to
receive
a
heavy
blow
from
his
commander

that
possibly
might
break
the
wrist
these
little
trifles
were
common
in
africa
instead
a
rouleau
of
napoleons
was
laid
on
his
open
palm
chateauroy
knew
the
gold
would
sting
more
than
the
blow
for
the
moment
cecil
had
but
one
impulse
to
dash
the
pieces
in
the
giver
face
in
time
to
restrain
the
impulse
he
caught
sight
of
the
wild
eager
hatred
gleaming
in
the
eyes
of
rake
of
petit
picpon
of
a
score
of
others
who
loved
him
and
cursed
their
colonel
and
would
at
one
signal
from
him
have
sheathed
their
swords
in
the
mighty
frame
of
the
marquis
though
they
should
have
been
fired
down
the
next
moment
themselves
for
the
murder
the
warning
of
cigarette
came
to
his
memory
his
hand
clasped
on
the
gold
he
gave
the
salute
calmly
as
chateauroy
swung
himself
away
the
troops
looked
at
him
with
longing
questioning
eyes
they
knew
enough
of
him
by
now
to
know
the
bitterness
such
gold
so
given
had
for
him
any
other
even
a
corporal
would
have
been
challenged
with
a
storm
of
raillery
a
volley
of
congratulation
and
would
have
had
shouted
or
hissed
after
him
opprobrious
accusations
of
faisant
suisse
if
he
had
not
forthwith
treated
his
comrades
royally
from
such
largesse
with
they
held
their
peace
they
kept
the
silence
which
they
saw
that
he
wished
to
keep
as
his
hour
of
liberty
being
come
he
went
slowly
out
of
the
great
court
with
the
handful
of
napoleons
thrust
in
the
folds
of
his
sash
rather
unconsciously
than
by
premeditation
his
steps
turned
through
the
streets
that
led
to
his
old
familiar
haunt
the
as
de
pique
and
dropping
down
on
a
bench
under
the
awning
he
asked
for
a
draught
of
water
it
was
brought
him
at
once
the
hostess
a
quick
brown
little
woman
from
paris
whom
the
lovers
of
eugene
sue
called
rogolette
adding
of
her
own
accord
a
lump
of
ice
and
a
slice
or
two
of
lemon
for
which
she
vivaciously
refused
payment
though
generosity
was
by
no
means
her
cardinal
virtue
awakened
general
interest
through
algiers
he
brought
so
fiery
and
so
daring
a
reputation
with
him
from
the
wars
and
raids
of
the
interior
yet
he
was
so
calm
so
grave
so
gentle
so
listless
it
was
known
that
he
had
made
himself
the
terror
of
kabyle
and
bedouin
yet
here
in
the
city
he
thanked
the
negro
boy
who
took
him
a
glass
of
lemonade
at
an
estaminet
and
sharply
rebuked
one
of
his
men
for
knocking
down
an
old
colon
with
a
burden
of
gourds
and
of
melons
such
a
roumi
as
this
the
good
people
of
the
capital
held
as
a
perfect
gift
of
the
gods
and
not
understanding
one
whit
nevertheless
fully
appreciated
he
did
not
look
at
the
newspapers
she
offered
him
but
sat
gazing
out
from
the
tawny
awning
like
the
sail
of
a
neapolitan
felucca
down
the
checkered
shadows
and
the
masses
of
the
little
crooked
rambling
alley
he
was
thinking
of
the
napoleons
in
his
sash
and
of
the
promise
he
had
pledged
to
cigarette
that
he
would
keep
it
he
was
resolved
the
few
impressive
vivid
words
of
the
young
vivandiere
had
painted
before
him
like
a
picture
the
horrors
of
mutiny
and
its
hopelessness
rather
than
that
through
him
these
should
befall
the
men
who
had
become
his
he
felt
ready
to
let
the
black
hawk
do
his
worst
on
his
own
life
yet
a
weariness
a
bitterness
he
had
never
known
in
the
excitement
of
active
service
came
on
him
brought
by
this
sting
of
insult
brought
from
the
fair
hand
of
an
aristocrate
there
was
absolutely
no
hope
possible
in
his
future
the
uttermost
that
could
ever
come
to
him
would
be
a
grade
something
higher
in
the
army
that
now
enrolled
him
the
gift
of
the
cross
or
a
post
in
the
bureau
algerine
warfare
was
not
like
the
campaigns
of
the
armies
of
italy
or
the
rhine
and
there
was
no
napoleon
here
to
discern
with
unerring
omniscience
a
leader
genius
under
the
kepi
of
a
common
trooper
though
he
should
show
the
qualities
of
a
massena
or
a
kleber
the
chances
were
a
million
to
one
that
he
would
never
get
even
as
much
as
a
lieutenancy
and
the
raids
on
the
decimated
tribes
the
obscure
skirmishes
of
the
interior
though
terrible
in
slaughter
and
venturesome
enough
were
not
the
fields
on
which
great
military
successes
were
won
and
great
military
honors
acquired
the
french
fought
for
a
barren
strip
of
brown
plateau
that
gained
would
be
of
little
use
or
profit
to
them
he
thought
that
he
did
much
the
same
that
his
future
was
much
like
those
arid
these
thirsty
verdureless
stretches
of
burned
earth
very
little
worth
the
reaching
the
heavy
folds
of
a
bedouin
haick
brushing
the
papers
off
the
bench
broke
the
thread
of
his
musings
as
he
stooped
for
them
he
saw
that
one
was
an
english
journal
some
weeks
old
his
own
name
caught
his
eye
the
name
buried
so
utterly
whose
utterance
in
the
sheik
tent
had
struck
him
like
a
dagger
thrust
the
flickering
light
and
darkness
as
the
awning
waved
to
and
fro
made
the
lines
move
dizzily
upward
and
downward
as
he
read
read
the
short
paragraph
touching
the
fortunes
of
the
race
that
had
disowned
him
the
royallieu
we
regret
to
learn
that
the
rt
hon
viscount
royallieu
who
so
lately
succeeded
to
the
family
title
on
his
father
death
has
expired
at
mentone
whither
his
health
had
induced
him
to
go
some
months
previous
the
late
lord
was
unmarried
his
next
brother
was
it
will
be
remembered
many
years
ago
killed
on
a
southern
railway
the
title
therefore
now
falls
to
the
third
and
only
remaining
son
the
hon
berkeley
cecil
who
having
lately
inherited
considerable
properties
from
a
distant
relative
will
we
believe
revive
all
the
old
glories
of
this
peerage
which
have
from
a
variety
of
causes
lost
somewhat
of
their
ancient
cecil
sat
quite
still
as
he
had
sat
looking
down
on
the
record
of
his
father
death
when
cigarette
had
rallied
him
with
her
gay
challenge
among
the
moresco
ruins
his
face
flushed
hotly
under
the
warm
golden
hue
of
the
desert
bronze
then
lost
all
its
color
as
suddenly
till
it
was
as
pale
as
any
of
the
ivory
he
carved
the
letters
of
the
paper
reeled
and
wavered
and
grew
misty
before
his
eyes
he
lost
all
sense
of
the
noisy
changing
polyglot
crowd
thronging
past
him
he
a
common
soldier
in
the
algerian
cavalry
knew
that
by
every
law
of
birthright
he
was
now
a
peer
of
england
his
first
thought
was
for
the
dead
man
true
there
had
been
little
amity
little
intimacy
between
them
a
negligent
friendliness
whenever
they
had
met
had
been
all
that
they
had
ever
reached
but
in
their
childhood
they
had
been
carelessly
kind
to
one
another
and
the
memory
of
the
boy
who
had
once
played
beside
him
down
the
old
galleries
and
under
the
old
forests
of
the
man
who
had
now
died
yonder
where
the
southern
lay
across
the
warm
blue
mediterranean
was
alone
on
him
for
the
moment
his
thoughts
had
gone
back
with
a
pang
almost
ere
he
had
read
the
opening
lines
to
autumn
mornings
in
his
youngest
years
when
the
leaves
had
been
flushed
with
their
earliest
red
and
the
brown
still
pools
had
been
alive
with
and
the
dogs
had
dropped
down
charging
among
the
flags
and
rushes
and
his
brother
boyish
face
had
laughed
on
him
from
the
wilderness
of
willows
and
his
boyish
hands
had
taught
him
to
handle
his
first
cartridge
and
to
fire
his
first
shot
the
many
years
of
indifference
and
estrangement
were
forgotten
the
few
years
of
childhood
confidence
and
comradeship
alone
remembered
as
he
saw
the
words
that
brought
him
in
his
exile
the
story
of
his
brethren
fate
and
of
his
race
fortunes
his
head
sank
his
face
was
still
colorless
he
sat
motionless
with
the
printed
sheet
in
his
hand
once
his
eyes
flashed
his
breath
came
fast
and
uneven
he
rose
with
a
sudden
impulse
with
a
proud
bold
instinct
of
birth
and
freedom
let
him
stand
here
in
what
grade
he
would
with
the
badge
of
a
corporal
of
the
army
of
africa
on
his
arm
this
inheritance
that
had
come
to
him
was
his
he
bore
the
name
and
the
title
of
his
house
as
surely
as
any
had
ever
borne
it
since
the
first
of
the
norman
owners
of
royallieu
had
followed
the
bastard
banner
the
vagabond
throngs
moorish
frank
negro
colon
paused
as
they
pushed
their
way
over
the
uneven
road
and
stared
at
him
vacantly
where
he
stood
there
was
something
in
his
attitude
in
his
look
which
swept
over
them
seeing
none
of
them
in
the
eager
lifting
of
his
head
in
the
excited
fire
in
his
eyes
that
arrested
all
from
the
dullest
muleteer
plodding
on
with
his
string
of
patient
beasts
to
the
most
volatile
french
girl
laughing
on
her
way
with
a
group
of
fantassins
he
did
not
note
them
hear
them
think
of
them
the
whole
of
the
algerine
scene
had
faded
out
as
if
it
had
no
place
before
him
he
had
forgot
that
he
was
a
cavalry
soldier
of
the
empire
he
saw
nothing
but
the
green
wealth
of
the
old
home
woods
far
away
in
england
he
remembered
nothing
save
that
he
and
he
alone
was
the
rightful
lord
of
royallieu
the
hand
of
a
veteran
of
chasseurs
fell
on
his
shoulder
and
the
wooden
rim
of
a
little
was
thrust
toward
him
with
the
proffered
drink
it
startled
him
and
recalled
him
to
the
consciousness
of
where
he
was
he
stared
one
moment
absently
in
the
trooper
amazed
face
and
then
shook
him
off
with
a
suddenness
that
tossed
back
the
cup
to
the
ground
and
holding
the
journal
clinched
close
in
his
hand
went
swiftly
through
the
masses
of
the
people
out
and
away
he
little
noted
where
till
he
had
forced
his
road
beyond
the
gates
beyond
the
town
beyond
all
reach
of
its
dust
and
its
babble
and
its
discord
and
was
alone
in
the
farther
outskirts
where
to
the
north
the
calm
sunlit
bay
slept
peacefully
with
a
few
scattered
ships
riding
at
anchor
and
southward
the
luxuriance
of
the
sahel
stretched
to
meet
the
wide
and
cheerless
plateaus
dotted
with
the
conical
houses
of
hair
and
desolate
as
though
the
had
just
alighted
there
to
lay
them
waste
reaching
the
heights
he
stood
still
involuntarily
and
looked
down
once
more
on
the
words
that
told
him
of
his
birthright
in
the
blinding
intense
light
of
the
african
day
they
seemed
to
stand
out
as
though
carved
in
stone
and
as
he
read
them
once
more
a
great
darkness
passed
over
his
face
this
heritage
was
his
and
he
could
never
take
it
up
this
thing
had
come
to
him
and
he
must
never
claim
it
he
was
viscount
royallieu
as
surely
as
any
of
his
fathers
had
been
so
before
him
and
he
was
dead
forever
in
the
world
belief
he
must
live
and
grow
old
and
perish
by
shot
or
steel
by
sickness
or
by
age
with
his
name
and
his
rights
buried
and
his
years
passed
as
a
private
soldier
of
france
the
momentary
glow
which
had
come
to
him
with
the
sudden
resurrection
of
hope
and
of
pride
faded
utterly
as
he
slowly
read
and
the
lines
of
the
journal
on
the
broken
terraces
of
the
where
the
great
fig
trees
spread
their
fantastic
shadows
and
through
a
rocky
channel
a
russet
stream
of
shallow
waters
threaded
its
downward
path
under
the
reeds
and
no
living
thing
was
near
him
save
some
quiet
browsing
herds
far
off
and
their
arab
that
an
artist
might
have
sketched
as
ishmael
what
his
future
might
have
been
rose
before
his
thoughts
what
it
must
be
rose
also
bitterly
blackly
drearily
in
contrast
a
noble
without
even
a
name
a
chief
of
his
race
without
even
the
power
to
claim
kinship
with
that
race
owner
by
law
of
three
thousand
broad
english
acres
yet
an
exile
without
freedom
to
set
foot
on
his
native
land
by
heritage
one
among
the
aristocracy
of
england
by
circumstances
now
and
forever
till
an
arab
bullet
should
cut
in
twain
his
thread
of
life
a
soldier
of
the
african
legions
bound
to
obey
the
commonest
and
coarsest
boor
that
had
risen
to
a
rank
above
him
this
was
what
he
knew
himself
to
be
and
knew
that
he
must
continue
to
be
without
one
appeal
against
it
without
once
stretching
out
his
hand
toward
his
right
of
birth
and
station
there
was
a
passionate
revolt
a
bitter
on
him
all
the
old
freedom
and
peace
and
luxury
and
pleasure
of
the
life
he
had
left
so
long
allured
him
with
a
terrible
temptation
the
honors
of
the
rank
that
he
should
now
have
filled
were
not
what
he
remembered
what
he
longed
for
with
an
agonized
desire
was
to
stand
once
more
stainless
among
his
equals
to
reach
once
more
the
liberty
of
unchallenged
unfettered
life
to
return
once
more
to
those
who
held
him
but
as
a
dishonored
memory
as
one
whom
violent
death
had
well
snatched
from
the
shame
of
a
criminal
career
but
who
would
believe
me
now
he
thought
besides
this
makes
no
difference
if
three
words
spoken
would
reinstate
me
i
could
not
speak
them
at
that
cost
the
beginning
perhaps
was
folly
but
for
sheer
justice
sake
there
is
no
drawing
back
now
let
him
enjoy
it
god
knows
i
do
not
grudge
him
yet
though
it
was
true
to
the
very
core
that
no
envy
and
no
evil
lay
in
his
heart
against
the
younger
brother
to
whose
lot
had
fallen
all
good
gifts
of
men
and
fate
there
was
almost
unbearable
anguish
on
him
in
this
hour
in
which
he
learned
the
inheritance
that
had
come
to
him
and
remembered
that
he
could
never
take
again
even
so
much
of
it
as
lay
in
the
name
of
his
fathers
when
he
had
given
his
memory
up
to
slander
and
oblivion
and
the
shadow
of
a
great
shame
when
he
had
let
his
life
die
out
from
the
world
that
had
known
him
and
buried
it
beneath
the
rough
cloth
of
a
private
soldier
uniform
he
had
not
counted
the
cost
then
nor
foreseen
the
cost
hereafter
it
had
fallen
on
him
very
heavily
now
where
he
stood
under
some
sheltered
columns
of
a
mosque
whose
shafts
were
bound
together
by
a
thousand
withes
and
wreaths
of
the
rich
fantastic
sahel
foliage
an
exceeding
weariness
of
longing
was
upon
him
longing
for
all
that
he
had
forfeited
for
all
that
was
his
own
yet
never
could
be
claimed
as
his
the
day
was
intensely
still
there
was
not
a
sound
except
when
here
and
there
the
movement
of
a
lizard
under
the
dry
grasses
gave
a
low
crackling
rustle
he
wondered
almost
which
was
the
dream
and
which
the
truth
that
old
life
that
he
had
once
led
and
that
looked
now
so
far
away
and
so
unreal
or
this
which
had
been
about
him
for
so
many
years
in
the
camps
and
the
bivouacs
the
barracks
and
the
battlefields
he
wondered
almost
which
he
himself
was
an
english
peer
on
whom
the
title
of
his
line
had
fallen
or
a
corporal
of
chasseurs
who
must
take
his
chief
insults
as
patiently
as
a
cur
takes
the
blows
of
its
master
that
he
was
both
seemed
to
him
as
he
stood
there
with
the
glisten
of
the
sea
before
and
the
swelling
slopes
of
the
hillside
above
a
vague
distorted
nightmare
hours
might
have
passed
or
only
moments
he
could
not
have
told
his
eyes
looked
blankly
out
at
the
his
hand
instinctively
clinched
on
the
journal
whose
stray
lines
had
told
him
in
an
algerine
trattoria
that
he
had
inherited
what
he
never
could
enjoy
are
they
content
i
wonder
he
thought
gazing
down
that
fiery
blaze
of
shadowless
light
do
they
ever
remember
he
thought
of
those
for
whose
sakes
he
had
become
what
he
was
the
distant
mellow
ringing
notes
of
a
floated
to
his
ear
from
the
town
at
his
feet
it
was
sounding
the
rentree
en
caserne
old
instinct
long
habit
made
him
start
and
shake
his
harness
together
and
listen
the
winding
cheerily
from
afar
off
recalled
him
to
the
truth
summoned
him
sharply
back
from
vain
regrets
to
the
facts
of
daily
life
it
waked
him
as
it
wakes
a
sleeping
charger
it
roused
him
as
it
rouses
a
wounded
trooper
he
stood
hearkening
to
the
familiar
music
till
it
had
died
away
spirited
yet
still
lingering
full
of
fire
yet
fading
softly
down
the
wind
he
listened
till
the
last
echo
ceased
then
he
tore
the
paper
that
he
held
in
strips
and
let
it
float
away
drifting
down
the
yellow
current
of
the
reedy
river
channel
and
he
half
drew
from
its
scabbard
the
saber
whose
blade
had
been
notched
and
dented
and
stained
in
many
midnight
skirmishes
and
many
headlong
charges
under
the
desert
suns
and
looked
at
it
as
though
a
friend
eye
gazed
at
him
in
the
gleam
of
the
trusty
steel
and
his
philosophy
his
campaigner
carelessness
his
habitual
easy
negligence
that
had
sometimes
been
weak
as
water
and
sometimes
heroic
as
martyrdom
came
back
to
him
with
a
deeper
shadow
on
it
that
was
grave
with
a
calm
resolute
silent
courage
so
best
after
all
perhaps
he
said
half
aloud
in
the
solitude
of
the
ruined
and
abandoned
mosque
he
can
not
well
come
to
shipwreck
with
such
a
fair
wind
and
such
a
smooth
sea
and
i
i
am
just
as
well
here
to
ride
with
the
chasseurs
is
more
exciting
than
to
ride
with
the
pytchley
and
the
rules
of
the
chambree
are
scarce
more
tedious
than
the
rules
of
a
court
nature
turned
me
out
for
a
soldier
though
fashion
spoiled
me
for
one
i
can
make
a
good
campaigner
i
should
never
make
anything
and
he
let
his
sword
drop
back
again
into
the
scabbard
and
quarreled
no
more
with
fate
his
hand
touched
the
thirty
gold
pieces
in
his
sash
he
started
as
the
recollection
of
the
forgotten
insult
came
back
on
him
he
stood
a
while
in
thought
then
he
took
his
resolve
a
half
hour
of
quick
movement
for
he
had
become
used
to
the
heat
as
an
arab
and
heeded
it
as
little
brought
him
before
the
of
the
villa
aioussa
a
native
of
soudan
in
a
rich
dress
who
had
the
office
of
porter
asked
him
politely
his
errand
every
indigene
learns
by
hard
experience
to
be
courteous
to
a
french
soldier
cecil
simply
asked
in
answer
if
mme
la
princesse
were
visible
the
negro
returned
cautiously
that
she
was
at
home
but
doubted
her
being
accessible
you
come
from
le
marquis
he
inquired
no
on
my
own
you
not
all
the
native
african
awe
of
a
roumi
could
restrain
the
contemptuous
amaze
in
the
word
i
ask
if
corporal
victor
of
the
chasseurs
can
be
permitted
a
moment
interview
with
your
mistress
i
come
by
permission
he
added
as
the
native
hesitated
between
his
fear
of
a
roumi
and
his
sense
of
the
appalling
unfittingness
of
a
private
soldier
seeking
audience
of
a
spanish
princesse
the
message
was
passed
about
between
several
of
the
household
at
last
a
servant
of
higher
authority
appeared
madame
permitted
corporal
victor
to
be
taken
to
her
presence
would
he
follow
he
uncovered
his
head
and
entered
passing
through
several
passages
and
chambers
richly
hung
and
furnished
for
the
villa
had
been
the
campagne
of
an
illustrious
french
personage
who
had
offered
it
to
the
princesse
corona
when
for
some
slight
delicacy
of
health
the
air
of
algeria
was
advocated
a
singular
sensation
came
on
him
half
of
familiarity
half
of
strangeness
as
he
advanced
along
them
for
twelve
years
he
had
seen
nothing
but
the
bare
walls
of
barrack
rooms
the
of
douars
and
the
canvas
of
his
own
to
come
once
more
after
so
long
an
interval
amid
the
old
things
of
luxury
and
grace
that
had
been
so
long
unseen
wrought
curiously
on
him
he
could
not
fairly
disentangle
past
and
present
for
the
moment
as
his
feet
fell
once
more
on
soft
carpets
and
his
eyes
glanced
over
gold
and
silver
malachite
and
bronze
white
silk
and
violet
damasks
he
almost
thought
the
algerian
years
were
a
disordered
dream
of
the
night
his
spur
caught
in
the
yielding
carpet
and
his
saber
clashed
slightly
against
it
as
the
rentree
au
caserne
had
done
an
hour
before
the
sound
recalled
the
actual
present
to
him
he
was
but
a
french
soldier
who
went
on
sufferance
into
the
presence
of
a
great
lady
all
the
rest
was
dead
and
buried
some
half
dozen
apartments
large
and
small
were
crossed
then
into
that
presence
he
was
ushered
the
room
was
deeply
shaded
and
fragrant
with
the
odors
of
the
innumerable
flowers
of
the
sahel
soil
there
was
that
about
it
which
struck
on
him
as
some
air
long
unheard
but
once
intimately
familiar
on
the
ear
will
revive
innumerable
memories
she
was
at
some
distance
from
him
with
the
trailing
draperies
of
eastern
fabrics
falling
about
her
in
a
rich
unbroken
shadowy
cloud
of
melting
color
through
which
here
and
there
broke
threads
of
gold
involuntarily
he
paused
on
the
threshold
looking
at
her
some
faint
remembrance
stirred
in
him
but
deep
down
in
the
closed
grave
of
his
past
some
vague
intangible
association
of
forgotten
days
forgotten
thoughts
drifted
before
him
as
it
had
drifted
before
him
when
first
in
the
chambree
of
his
barracks
he
had
beheld
venetia
corona
she
moved
forward
as
her
servant
announced
him
she
saw
him
pause
there
like
one
and
thought
it
the
hesitation
of
one
who
felt
sensitively
his
own
low
grade
in
life
she
came
toward
him
with
the
silent
sweeping
grace
that
gave
her
the
carriage
of
an
empress
her
voice
fell
on
his
ear
with
the
accent
of
a
woman
immeasurably
proud
but
too
proud
not
to
bend
softly
and
graciously
to
those
who
were
so
far
beneath
her
that
without
such
aid
from
her
they
could
never
have
addressed
or
have
approached
her
you
have
come
i
trust
to
withdraw
your
prohibition
nothing
will
give
me
greater
pleasure
than
to
bring
his
majesty
notice
to
one
of
the
best
soldiers
his
army
there
was
that
in
the
words
gently
as
they
were
spoken
that
recalled
him
suddenly
to
himself
they
had
that
negligent
courteous
pity
she
would
have
shown
to
some
colon
begging
at
her
gates
he
forgot
forgot
utterly
that
he
was
only
an
african
trooper
he
only
remembered
that
he
had
once
been
a
gentleman
that
if
a
life
of
honor
and
of
can
make
any
so
he
was
one
still
he
advanced
and
bowed
with
the
old
serene
elegance
that
his
bow
had
once
been
famed
for
and
she
well
used
to
be
even
overcritical
in
such
trifles
thought
that
man
has
once
lived
in
courts
pardon
me
madame
i
do
not
come
to
trespass
so
far
upon
your
benignity
he
answered
as
he
bent
before
her
i
come
to
express
rather
my
regret
that
you
should
have
made
one
single
error
a
haughty
surprise
glanced
from
her
eyes
as
they
swept
over
him
such
a
word
had
never
been
used
to
her
in
the
whole
course
of
her
brilliant
and
pampered
life
of
sovereignty
and
indulgence
one
common
enough
madame
in
your
order
the
error
to
suppose
that
under
the
rough
cloth
of
a
private
trooper
uniform
there
can
not
possibly
be
such
aristocratic
monopolies
as
nerves
to
i
do
not
comprehend
she
spoke
very
coldly
she
repented
her
profoundly
of
her
concession
in
admitting
a
chasseur
to
her
presence
possibly
not
mine
was
the
folly
to
dream
that
you
would
ever
do
so
i
should
not
have
intruded
on
you
now
but
for
this
reason
the
humiliation
you
were
pleased
to
pass
on
me
i
could
neither
refuse
nor
resent
to
the
dealer
of
it
had
i
done
so
men
who
are
only
too
loyal
to
me
would
have
resented
with
me
and
been
thrashed
or
been
shot
as
payment
i
was
compelled
to
accept
it
and
to
wait
until
i
could
return
your
gift
to
you
i
have
no
right
to
complain
that
you
pained
me
with
it
since
one
who
occupies
my
position
ought
i
presume
to
consider
remembrance
even
by
an
outrage
an
honor
done
to
him
by
the
princesse
as
he
said
the
last
words
he
laid
on
the
table
that
stood
near
him
the
gold
of
chateauroy
insult
she
had
listened
with
a
bewildering
wonder
held
in
check
by
the
haughtier
impulse
of
offense
that
a
man
in
this
grade
could
venture
thus
to
address
thus
to
arraign
her
his
words
were
totally
incomprehensible
to
her
though
by
the
grave
rebuke
of
his
manner
she
saw
that
they
were
fully
meant
and
as
he
considered
fully
authorized
by
some
wrong
done
to
him
as
he
laid
the
gold
pieces
down
upon
her
table
an
idea
of
the
truth
came
to
her
i
know
nothing
of
what
you
complain
of
i
sent
you
no
money
what
is
it
you
would
imply
she
asked
him
looking
up
from
where
she
leaned
back
in
the
low
couch
into
whose
depth
she
had
sunk
as
he
had
spoken
you
did
not
send
me
these
not
as
payment
for
the
chess
service
absolutely
not
after
what
you
said
the
other
day
i
should
have
scarcely
been
so
and
so
heedless
of
inflicting
pain
who
used
my
name
thus
his
face
lightened
with
a
pleasure
and
a
relief
that
changed
it
wonderfully
that
brighter
look
of
gladness
had
been
a
stranger
to
it
for
so
many
years
you
give
me
infinite
happiness
madame
you
little
dream
how
bitter
such
slights
are
where
one
has
lost
the
power
to
resent
them
it
was
de
chateauroy
who
this
morning
dared
to
tell
you
i
sent
you
those
coins
the
serenity
of
a
courtly
woman
of
the
world
was
unbroken
but
her
blue
and
brilliant
eyes
darkened
and
gleamed
beneath
the
sweep
of
their
lashes
perhaps
i
can
scarcely
say
so
much
he
gave
them
and
he
implied
that
he
gave
them
from
you
the
words
he
spoke
were
he
told
her
them
as
they
had
been
uttered
adding
no
more
she
saw
the
construction
they
had
been
intended
to
bear
and
that
which
they
had
borne
naturally
to
his
ear
she
listened
earnestly
to
the
end
then
she
turned
to
him
with
the
exquisite
softness
of
grace
which
when
she
was
moved
to
it
contrasted
so
vividly
with
the
haughty
and
almost
chill
languor
of
her
habitual
manner
believe
me
i
regret
deeply
that
you
should
have
been
wounded
by
this
most
coarse
indignity
i
grieve
sincerely
that
through
myself
in
any
way
it
should
have
been
brought
upon
you
as
for
the
perpetrator
of
it
de
chateauroy
will
be
received
here
no
more
and
it
shall
be
my
care
that
he
learns
not
only
how
i
resent
his
unpardonable
use
of
my
name
but
how
i
esteem
his
cruel
outrage
to
a
defender
of
his
own
flag
you
did
exceedingly
well
and
wisely
to
acquaint
me
in
your
treatment
of
it
as
an
affront
that
i
was
without
warrant
to
offer
you
you
showed
the
just
indignation
of
a
soldier
and
of
what
i
am
very
sure
that
you
are
a
he
bowed
low
before
her
madame
you
have
made
me
the
debtor
of
my
enemy
outrage
those
words
from
you
are
more
than
sufficient
compensation
for
a
poor
one
i
fear
your
colonel
is
your
enemy
then
and
wherefore
he
paused
a
moment
why
at
first
i
scarcely
know
we
are
antagonistic
i
but
is
it
usual
for
officers
of
his
high
grade
to
show
such
malice
to
their
soldiers
most
unusual
in
this
service
especially
so
although
officers
rising
from
the
ranks
themselves
are
more
apt
to
contract
prejudices
and
ill
feeling
against
as
they
are
to
feel
favoritism
to
their
men
than
where
they
enter
the
regiment
in
a
superior
grade
at
once
at
least
that
is
the
opinion
i
myself
have
formed
studying
the
working
of
the
different
you
know
the
english
service
then
i
know
something
of
and
still
though
thinking
this
you
prefer
the
french
i
distinctly
prefer
it
as
one
that
knows
how
to
make
fine
soldiers
and
how
to
reward
them
as
one
in
which
a
brave
man
will
be
valued
and
a
veteran
will
not
be
left
to
die
like
a
horse
at
a
a
brave
man
valued
and
yet
you
are
a
corporal
thought
milady
as
he
pursued
since
i
am
here
madame
let
me
thank
you
in
the
army
name
for
your
infinite
goodness
in
acting
so
munificently
on
my
slight
hint
your
generosity
has
made
many
happy
hearts
in
the
generosity
oh
do
not
call
it
by
any
such
name
what
did
it
cost
me
we
are
terribly
selfish
here
i
am
indebted
to
you
that
for
once
you
made
me
remember
those
who
she
spoke
with
a
certain
impulse
of
candor
and
of
that
broke
with
great
sweetness
the
somewhat
coldness
of
her
general
manner
it
was
like
a
gleam
of
light
that
showed
all
the
depth
and
the
warmth
that
in
truth
lay
beneath
that
imperious
languor
of
habit
it
broke
further
the
ice
of
distance
that
severed
the
grande
dame
from
the
cavalry
soldier
insensibly
to
himself
the
knowledge
that
he
had
in
fact
the
right
to
stand
before
her
as
an
equal
gave
him
the
bearing
of
one
who
exercised
that
right
and
her
rapid
perception
had
felt
before
now
that
this
roumi
of
africa
was
as
true
a
gentleman
as
any
that
had
ever
thronged
about
her
in
palaces
her
own
life
had
been
an
uninterrupted
course
of
luxury
prosperity
serenity
and
power
the
adversity
which
she
could
not
but
perceive
had
weighed
on
his
had
a
strange
interest
to
her
she
had
heard
of
many
calamities
and
aided
many
but
they
had
always
been
far
sundered
from
her
they
had
never
touched
her
in
this
man
presence
they
seemed
to
grow
very
close
terribly
real
she
led
him
on
to
speak
of
his
comrades
of
his
daily
life
of
his
harassing
routine
of
duties
in
peace
and
of
his
various
experiences
in
war
he
told
her
too
of
leon
ramon
history
and
as
she
listened
he
saw
a
mist
arise
and
dim
the
brilliancy
of
those
eyes
that
men
complained
would
never
soften
the
very
fidelity
with
which
he
sketched
to
her
the
bitter
sufferings
and
the
rough
nobility
that
were
momentarily
borne
and
seen
in
that
great
military
family
of
which
he
had
become
a
son
by
adoption
interested
her
by
its
very
unlikeness
to
anything
in
her
own
world
his
voice
had
still
the
old
sweetness
his
manner
still
its
old
grace
and
added
to
these
were
a
grave
earnestness
and
a
natural
eloquence
that
the
darkness
of
his
own
fortunes
and
the
sympathies
with
others
that
pain
had
awakened
had
brought
to
him
he
wholly
forgot
their
respective
stations
he
only
remembered
that
for
the
first
time
for
so
many
years
he
had
the
charm
of
converse
with
a
woman
of
high
breeding
of
inexpressible
beauty
and
of
keen
and
delicate
intuition
he
wholly
forgot
how
time
passed
and
she
did
not
seek
to
remind
him
indeed
she
but
little
noted
it
herself
at
last
the
conversation
turned
back
to
his
chief
you
seem
to
be
aware
of
some
motive
for
your
commandant
dislike
she
asked
him
tell
me
to
what
you
attribute
it
it
is
a
long
tale
no
matter
i
would
hear
i
fear
it
would
only
weary
do
not
fear
that
tell
it
he
obeyed
and
told
to
her
the
story
of
the
emir
and
of
the
pearl
of
the
desert
and
venetia
corona
listened
as
she
had
listened
to
him
throughout
with
an
interest
that
she
rarely
vouchsafed
to
the
recitals
and
the
witticisms
of
her
own
circle
he
gave
to
the
narrative
a
soldierly
simplicity
and
a
picturesque
coloring
that
lent
a
new
interest
to
her
and
she
was
of
that
nature
which
however
it
may
be
led
to
conceal
feeling
from
pride
and
from
hatred
never
fails
to
awaken
to
indignant
sympathy
at
wrong
this
barbarian
is
your
chief
she
said
as
the
tale
closed
his
enmity
is
your
honor
i
can
well
credit
that
he
will
never
pardon
your
having
stood
between
him
and
his
he
has
never
pardoned
it
yet
of
a
i
will
not
tell
you
it
was
a
noble
action
she
said
with
a
smile
sweet
as
the
morning
a
smile
that
few
saw
light
on
them
it
came
too
naturally
to
a
man
of
honor
for
you
to
care
for
the
epithet
yet
it
was
a
great
one
a
most
generous
one
but
i
have
not
heard
one
thing
what
argument
did
you
use
to
obtain
her
release
no
one
has
ever
heard
it
he
answered
her
while
his
voice
sank
low
i
will
trust
you
with
it
it
will
not
pass
elsewhere
i
told
him
enough
of
of
my
own
past
life
to
show
him
that
i
knew
what
his
had
been
and
that
i
knew
moreover
though
they
were
dead
to
me
now
men
in
that
greater
world
of
europe
who
would
believe
my
statement
if
i
wrote
them
this
outrage
on
the
emir
and
would
avenge
it
for
the
reputation
of
the
empire
and
unless
he
released
the
emir
wife
i
swore
to
him
that
i
would
so
write
though
he
had
me
shot
on
the
morrow
and
he
knew
i
should
keep
my
she
was
silent
some
moments
looking
on
him
with
a
musing
gaze
in
which
some
pity
and
more
honor
for
him
were
blended
you
told
him
your
past
will
you
confess
it
to
me
i
can
not
and
why
because
i
am
dead
because
in
your
presence
it
becomes
more
bitter
to
me
to
remember
that
i
ever
you
speak
strangely
can
not
your
life
have
a
resurrection
never
madame
for
a
brief
hour
you
have
given
it
one
in
dreams
it
will
have
no
but
surely
there
may
be
ways
such
a
story
as
you
have
told
me
brought
to
the
emperor
knowledge
you
would
see
your
enemy
disgraced
yourself
honored
possibly
madame
but
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
it
should
ever
be
so
brought
as
i
am
now
so
i
desire
to
live
and
you
voluntarily
condemn
yourself
to
this
i
have
voluntarily
chosen
it
i
am
well
sure
that
the
silence
i
entreat
will
be
kept
by
you
assuredly
unless
by
your
wish
it
be
broken
yet
i
await
my
arrival
here
he
is
a
soldier
himself
i
shall
hope
that
he
will
persuade
you
to
think
differently
of
your
future
at
any
rate
both
his
and
my
own
influence
will
always
be
exerted
for
you
if
you
will
avail
yourself
of
you
do
me
much
honor
madame
all
i
will
ever
ask
of
you
is
to
return
those
coins
to
my
colonel
and
to
forget
that
your
gentleness
has
made
me
forget
for
one
merciful
half
hour
the
sufferance
on
which
alone
a
trooper
can
present
himself
he
swept
the
ground
with
his
kepi
as
though
it
were
the
plumed
hat
of
a
marshal
and
backed
slowly
from
her
presence
as
he
had
many
a
time
long
before
backed
out
of
a
as
he
went
his
eyes
caught
the
armies
of
the
ivory
chessmen
they
stood
under
glass
and
had
not
been
broken
by
her
lapdog
milady
left
alone
there
in
her
luxurious
morning
room
sat
a
while
lost
in
thought
he
attracted
her
he
interested
her
he
aroused
her
sympathy
and
her
wonder
as
the
men
of
her
own
world
failed
to
do
aroused
them
despite
the
pride
which
made
her
impatient
of
lending
so
much
attention
to
a
mere
chasseur
his
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
he
was
in
reality
the
representative
of
his
race
although
the
power
to
declare
himself
so
had
been
forever
abandoned
and
lost
had
given
him
in
her
presence
that
day
a
certain
melancholy
and
a
certain
grave
dignity
that
would
have
shown
a
far
more
superficial
observer
than
she
was
that
he
had
come
of
a
great
race
and
had
memories
that
were
of
a
very
different
hue
to
the
coarse
and
hard
life
which
he
led
now
she
had
seen
much
of
the
world
and
was
naturally
far
more
penetrative
and
more
correct
in
judgment
than
are
most
women
she
discovered
the
ring
of
true
gold
in
his
words
and
the
carriage
of
pure
breeding
in
his
actions
he
interested
her
more
than
it
pleased
her
that
he
should
a
man
so
utterly
beneath
her
doubtless
brought
into
the
grade
to
which
he
had
fallen
by
every
kind
of
error
of
improvidence
of
folly
of
probably
worse
than
folly
it
was
too
absurd
that
she
so
difficult
to
interest
so
inaccessible
so
fastidious
so
satiated
with
all
that
was
brilliant
and
celebrated
should
find
herself
seriously
spending
her
thoughts
her
pity
and
her
speculation
on
an
adventurer
of
the
african
army
she
laughed
a
little
at
herself
as
she
stretched
out
her
hand
for
a
new
volume
of
french
poems
dedicated
to
her
by
their
accomplished
writer
who
was
a
parisian
diplomatist
one
would
imagine
i
was
just
out
of
a
convent
and
weaving
a
marvelous
romance
from
a
mystery
and
a
tristesse
because
the
first
soldier
i
notice
in
algeria
has
a
gentleman
voice
and
is
ill
treated
by
his
officers
she
thought
with
a
smile
while
she
opened
the
poems
which
had
that
day
arrived
radiant
in
the
creamy
vellum
the
white
velvet
and
the
gold
of
a
dedication
copy
with
the
coronet
of
the
corona
on
their
binding
the
poems
were
sparkling
with
grace
and
elegant
silvery
harmonies
but
they
served
ill
to
chain
her
attention
for
while
she
read
her
eyes
wandered
at
intervals
to
the
chess
battalions
such
a
man
as
that
buried
in
the
ranks
of
this
brutalized
army
she
mused
what
fatal
chance
could
bring
him
here
misfortune
not
misconduct
surely
i
wonder
if
lyon
could
learn
he
shall
your
chasseur
has
the
air
of
a
prince
my
love
said
a
voice
behind
her
equivocal
compliment
a
much
better
air
than
most
princes
said
mme
corona
glancing
up
with
a
slight
shrug
of
her
shoulders
as
her
guest
and
traveling
companion
the
marquise
de
renardiere
entered
indeed
i
saw
him
as
he
passed
out
and
he
saluted
me
as
if
he
had
been
a
marshal
why
did
he
come
venetia
corona
pointed
to
the
napoleons
and
told
the
story
rather
listlessly
and
briefly
ah
the
man
has
been
a
gentleman
i
dare
say
so
many
of
them
come
to
our
army
i
remember
general
villefleur
telling
me
he
commanded
here
a
while
that
the
ranks
of
the
zephyrs
and
zouaves
were
full
of
men
utterly
the
handsomest
scoundrels
possible
who
had
every
gift
and
every
grace
and
yet
come
to
no
better
end
than
a
in
a
ditch
or
a
mortal
thrust
from
bedouin
steel
i
dare
say
your
corporal
is
one
of
it
may
be
but
you
doubt
it
i
i
am
not
sure
now
that
i
do
but
this
person
is
certainly
unlike
a
man
to
whom
disgrace
has
ever
you
think
your
protege
then
has
become
what
he
is
through
adversity
i
suppose
very
interesting
i
really
can
tell
you
nothing
of
his
antecedents
through
his
skill
at
sculpture
and
my
notice
of
it
considerable
indignity
has
been
brought
upon
him
and
a
soldier
can
feel
it
seems
though
it
is
very
absurd
that
he
should
that
is
all
my
concern
with
the
matter
except
that
i
have
to
teach
his
commander
not
to
play
with
my
name
in
his
barrack
she
spoke
with
that
negligence
which
always
sounded
very
cold
though
the
words
were
so
gently
spoken
her
best
and
most
familiar
friends
always
knew
when
with
that
courtly
chillness
she
had
signed
them
their
line
of
demarcation
and
the
marquise
de
renardiere
said
no
more
but
talked
of
the
ambassador
poems
chapter
xxv
le
bon
meanwhile
the
subject
of
their
first
discourse
returned
to
the
chambree
he
had
encouraged
the
men
to
pursue
those
various
industries
and
ingenuities
which
though
they
are
affectedly
considered
against
discipline
formed
as
he
knew
well
the
best
preservative
from
real
insubordination
and
the
best
instrument
in
humanizing
and
ameliorating
the
condition
of
his
comrades
the
habit
of
application
alone
was
something
gained
and
if
it
kept
them
only
for
a
while
from
the
haunts
of
those
coarsest
debaucheries
which
are
the
only
possible
form
in
which
the
soldier
can
pursue
the
forbidden
license
of
vice
it
was
better
than
that
leisure
should
be
spent
in
that
joyless
bestiality
which
made
cecil
once
used
to
every
refinement
of
luxury
and
indulgence
sicken
with
a
pitying
wonder
for
those
who
found
in
it
the
only
shape
they
knew
of
he
had
seen
from
the
first
capabilities
that
might
be
turned
to
endless
uses
in
the
conscript
drawn
from
the
populace
of
the
provinces
there
was
almost
always
a
knowledge
of
and
often
of
some
trade
coupled
with
habits
of
diligence
in
the
soldier
made
from
the
street
arab
of
paris
there
were
always
inconceivable
intelligence
rapidity
of
wit
and
plastic
vivacity
in
the
adventurers
come
like
himself
from
higher
grades
of
society
and
burying
a
broken
career
under
the
shelter
of
the
tricolor
there
were
continually
gifts
and
acquirements
and
even
genius
that
had
run
to
seed
and
brought
forth
no
fruit
of
all
these
france
always
avails
herself
in
a
great
degree
but
as
far
as
influence
extended
they
were
developed
much
more
than
usual
as
his
own
character
gradually
changed
under
the
force
of
fate
the
desire
for
some
interest
in
life
grew
on
him
every
man
save
one
absolutely
brainless
and
feels
this
sooner
or
late
and
that
interest
he
found
or
rather
created
in
his
regiment
all
that
he
could
do
to
contribute
to
its
efficiency
in
the
field
he
did
all
that
he
could
do
to
further
its
internal
excellence
he
did
likewise
coarseness
perceptibly
abated
and
violence
became
much
rarer
in
that
portion
of
his
corps
with
which
he
had
immediately
to
do
the
men
gradually
acquired
from
him
a
better
a
higher
tone
they
learned
to
do
duties
inglorious
and
distasteful
as
well
as
they
did
those
which
led
them
to
the
danger
and
the
excitation
that
they
loved
and
having
their
good
faith
and
sympathy
heart
and
soul
with
him
he
met
in
these
lawless
leopards
of
african
france
with
loyalty
courage
generosity
and
far
surpassing
those
which
he
had
ever
met
with
in
the
polished
civilization
of
his
early
experience
for
their
sakes
he
spent
many
of
his
free
hours
in
the
chambree
many
a
man
seeing
him
there
came
and
worked
at
some
ingenious
design
instead
of
going
off
to
burn
his
brains
out
with
brandy
if
he
had
sous
enough
to
buy
any
or
to
do
some
dexterous
bit
of
thieving
on
a
native
if
he
had
not
many
a
time
knowing
him
to
be
there
sufficed
to
restrain
the
talk
around
from
lewdness
and
from
ribaldry
and
turn
it
into
channels
at
once
less
loathsome
and
more
mirthful
because
they
felt
that
obscenity
and
vulgarity
were
alike
jarring
on
his
ear
although
he
had
never
more
than
tacitly
shown
that
they
were
so
a
precisian
would
have
been
covered
with
their
contumely
and
ridicule
a
saint
would
have
been
driven
out
from
their
midst
with
every
missile
merciless
tongues
and
merciless
hands
could
pelt
with
a
martinet
would
have
been
cursed
aloud
and
cheated
flouted
rebelled
against
on
every
possible
occasion
but
the
man
who
was
one
of
them
entirely
while
yet
simply
and
thoroughly
a
gentleman
had
great
influence
an
influence
exclusively
for
good
the
chambree
was
empty
when
he
returned
the
men
were
scattered
over
the
town
in
one
of
their
scant
pauses
of
liberty
there
was
only
the
dog
of
the
regiment
a
poodle
asleep
in
the
heat
on
a
sack
who
without
waking
moved
his
tail
in
a
sign
of
gratification
as
cecil
stroked
him
and
sat
down
near
betaking
himself
to
the
work
he
had
in
hand
it
was
a
stone
for
the
grave
of
leon
ramon
there
was
no
other
to
remember
the
dead
chasseur
no
other
beside
himself
save
an
old
woman
sitting
spinning
at
her
wheel
under
the
shingle
roof
of
a
cottage
by
the
western
biscayan
sea
who
as
she
spun
and
as
the
thread
flew
looked
with
anxious
aged
eyes
over
the
purple
waves
where
she
had
seen
his
father
the
son
of
her
youth
go
down
beneath
the
waters
but
the
thread
of
her
flax
would
be
spun
out
and
the
thread
of
her
waning
life
be
broken
ere
ever
the
soldier
for
whom
she
watched
would
go
back
to
her
and
to
languedoc
for
life
is
brutal
and
to
none
so
brutal
as
to
the
aged
who
remember
so
well
and
yet
are
forgotten
as
though
already
they
were
amid
the
dead
cecil
hand
pressed
the
graver
along
the
letters
but
his
thoughts
wandered
far
from
the
place
where
he
was
alone
there
in
the
great
barrack
room
the
news
that
he
had
read
the
presence
he
had
quitted
seemed
like
a
dream
he
had
never
known
fully
all
that
he
had
lost
until
he
had
stood
before
the
beauty
of
this
woman
in
whose
deep
imperial
eyes
the
light
of
other
years
seemed
to
lie
the
memories
of
other
worlds
seemed
to
slumber
these
blue
proud
fathomless
eyes
why
had
they
looked
on
him
he
had
grown
content
with
his
fate
he
had
been
satisfied
to
live
and
to
fall
a
soldier
of
france
he
had
set
a
seal
on
that
life
of
his
earlier
time
and
had
grown
to
forget
that
it
had
ever
been
why
had
chance
flung
him
in
her
way
that
with
one
careless
haughty
glance
one
smile
of
courteous
pity
she
should
have
undone
in
a
moment
all
the
work
of
a
years
and
shattered
in
a
day
the
serenity
which
it
had
cost
him
such
weary
such
victory
to
attain
she
had
come
to
pain
to
weaken
to
disturb
to
influence
him
to
shadow
his
peace
to
wring
his
pride
to
unman
his
resolve
as
women
do
mostly
with
men
was
life
not
hard
enough
here
already
that
she
must
make
it
more
bitter
yet
to
bear
he
had
been
content
with
a
soldier
contentment
in
danger
and
in
duty
and
she
must
waken
the
old
coiled
serpent
of
restless
stinging
regret
which
he
had
thought
lulled
to
rest
forever
if
i
had
my
heritage
he
thought
and
the
chisel
fell
from
his
hands
as
he
looked
down
the
length
of
the
barrack
room
with
the
blue
glare
of
the
african
sky
through
the
casement
then
he
smiled
at
his
own
folly
in
dreaming
idly
thus
of
things
that
might
have
been
i
will
see
her
no
more
he
said
to
himself
if
i
do
not
take
care
i
shall
end
by
thinking
myself
a
martyr
the
last
refuge
and
consolation
of
emasculate
vanity
of
impotent
egotism
for
though
his
whole
existence
was
a
sacrifice
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
anything
whatever
great
in
its
acceptation
or
unjust
in
its
endurance
he
thought
too
little
of
his
life
value
or
of
its
deserts
even
to
consider
by
any
chance
that
it
had
been
harshly
dealt
with
or
unmeritedly
visited
at
that
instant
petit
picpon
keen
pale
parisian
face
peered
through
the
door
his
great
black
eyes
that
at
times
had
so
pathetic
a
melancholy
and
at
others
such
a
monkeyish
mirth
and
malice
were
sparkling
excitedly
and
gleefully
mon
caporal
you
picpon
what
is
it
mon
caporal
there
is
great
news
there
is
fighting
broken
out
ah
are
you
sure
sure
mon
caporal
the
arbicos
want
a
skirmish
to
the
music
of
musketry
we
are
not
to
know
just
yet
we
are
to
have
the
order
de
route
i
overheard
our
officers
say
so
they
think
we
shall
have
brisk
work
and
for
that
they
will
not
punish
the
vieille
punish
is
there
fresh
disobedience
in
my
squadron
in
my
absence
he
rose
instinctively
buckling
on
the
sword
which
he
had
put
aside
not
in
your
squadron
mon
caporal
said
picpon
quickly
it
is
not
much
either
only
the
bon
zig
rake
what
has
he
been
doing
there
was
infinite
anxiety
and
vexation
in
his
voice
rake
had
recently
been
changed
into
another
squadron
of
the
regiment
to
his
great
loss
and
regret
for
not
only
did
he
miss
the
man
bright
face
and
familiar
voice
from
the
chambree
but
he
had
much
disquietude
on
the
score
of
his
safety
for
rake
was
an
incorrigible
pratique
had
only
been
kept
from
scrapes
and
mischief
by
cecil
influence
and
even
despite
that
had
been
often
in
hot
water
and
once
even
had
been
drafted
for
a
year
or
so
of
chastisement
among
the
zephyrs
a
mode
of
punishment
which
but
for
its
separation
of
him
from
his
idol
would
have
given
unmitigated
delight
to
the
audacious
offender
very
little
mon
caporal
said
picpon
eagerly
a
mere
nothing
a
bagatelle
run
a
spahi
through
the
stomach
that
is
all
i
do
think
the
man
is
so
much
as
dead
even
i
hope
not
indeed
when
will
you
cease
this
brawling
among
yourselves
a
soldier
blade
should
never
be
turned
upon
men
of
his
own
army
how
did
it
happen
a
woman
they
quarreled
about
a
little
the
spahi
was
in
fault
was
there
before
him
and
was
preferred
by
the
girl
and
women
should
be
allowed
something
to
do
with
choosing
their
lovers
that
i
think
though
it
is
true
they
often
take
the
worst
man
they
quarreled
the
spahi
drew
first
and
then
pouf
et
passe
quick
as
thought
rac
lunged
through
him
he
has
always
a
most
beautiful
stroke
le
capitaine
argentier
was
passing
and
made
a
fuss
else
nothing
would
have
been
done
they
have
put
him
under
arrest
but
i
heard
them
say
they
would
let
him
free
because
we
should
march
at
i
will
go
and
see
him
at
wait
mon
caporal
i
have
something
to
tell
you
said
picpon
quickly
the
zig
has
a
motive
in
what
he
does
rac
wanted
to
get
the
prison
he
has
done
more
than
one
bit
of
mischief
only
for
only
for
what
he
can
not
be
in
love
with
the
prison
it
serves
his
turn
said
picpon
mysteriously
did
you
never
guess
why
mon
caporal
well
i
have
is
a
fine
fearless
soldier
the
officers
know
it
the
bureaus
know
it
he
would
have
mounted
mounted
mounted
and
been
a
captain
long
before
now
if
he
had
not
been
a
i
know
that
so
would
many
of
ah
mon
caporal
but
that
is
just
what
rac
does
not
choose
in
the
books
his
page
beats
every
man
except
yours
they
have
talked
of
him
many
times
for
the
cross
and
for
promotion
but
whenever
they
do
he
goes
off
to
a
bit
of
mischief
and
gets
himself
punished
any
term
of
punishment
long
or
short
serves
his
purpose
they
think
him
too
wild
to
take
out
of
the
ranks
you
remember
mon
caporal
that
splendid
thing
that
he
did
five
years
ago
at
sabasasta
well
you
know
they
spoke
of
promoting
him
for
it
and
he
would
have
run
up
all
the
grades
like
a
squirrel
and
died
a
kebir
i
dare
say
what
did
he
do
to
prevent
it
why
went
that
escapade
into
oran
disguised
as
a
dervish
and
go
the
prison
to
prevent
it
not
purposely
purposely
mon
caporal
said
petit
picpon
with
a
sapient
nod
that
spoke
volumes
he
always
does
something
when
he
thinks
promotion
is
coming
something
to
get
himself
out
of
its
way
do
you
see
and
the
reason
is
this
is
a
good
zig
and
loves
you
and
will
not
be
put
over
your
head
rise
afore
him
said
the
zig
to
me
once
have
the
as
de
pique
on
my
collar
fifty
times
over
first
he
a
prince
and
a
mongrel
got
in
a
gutter
i
owe
him
more
than
i
ever
pay
and
kill
the
kebir
himself
afore
i
insult
him
that
way
so
say
little
to
him
about
the
spahi
mon
caporal
he
loves
you
well
does
your
well
indeed
good
god
what
nobility
picpon
glanced
at
him
then
with
the
tact
of
his
nation
glided
away
and
busied
himself
teaching
to
shoulder
and
present
arms
the
weapon
being
a
long
stick
after
all
diderot
was
in
the
right
when
he
told
rousseau
which
side
of
the
question
to
take
mused
cecil
as
he
crossed
the
a
few
minutes
later
to
visit
the
incarcerated
pratique
on
my
life
civilization
develops
comfort
but
i
do
believe
it
kills
nobility
individuality
dies
in
it
and
egotism
grows
strong
and
specious
why
is
it
that
in
a
polished
life
a
man
while
becoming
incapable
of
sinking
to
crime
almost
always
becomes
also
incapable
of
rising
to
greatness
why
is
it
that
misery
tumult
privation
bloodshed
famine
beget
in
such
a
life
as
this
such
countless
things
of
heroism
of
endurance
of
things
worthy
of
demigods
in
men
who
quarrel
with
the
wolves
for
a
carcass
for
a
sheep
offal
a
question
which
perplexes
very
wearily
thinkers
who
have
more
time
more
subtlety
and
more
logic
to
bring
to
its
unravelment
than
bertie
had
either
leisure
or
inclination
to
do
is
this
true
rake
that
you
intentionally
commit
these
freaks
of
misconduct
to
escape
promotion
he
asked
of
the
man
when
he
stood
alone
with
him
in
his
place
of
confinement
rake
flushed
a
little
mischief
bred
in
me
sir
it
must
come
out
it
just
bottled
up
in
me
like
ale
if
i
did
take
the
cork
out
now
and
then
i
should
fly
apieces
but
many
a
time
when
you
have
been
close
on
the
reward
of
your
splendid
gallantry
in
the
field
you
have
frustrated
your
own
fortunes
and
the
wishes
of
your
superiors
by
wantonly
proving
yourself
unfit
for
the
higher
grade
they
were
going
to
raise
you
to
why
do
you
do
that
rake
fidgeted
restlessly
and
to
avoid
the
awkwardness
of
the
question
replied
like
a
parliamentary
orator
by
a
flow
of
rhetoric
sir
there
a
many
chaps
like
me
they
ca
help
nohow
busting
out
when
the
fit
takes
reasonable
to
blame
for
it
just
made
so
like
a
chestnut
made
to
bust
its
pod
and
a
chicken
to
bust
its
shell
well
you
see
sir
france
she
knows
that
and
she
says
to
herself
are
these
madcaps
if
i
keep
tight
in
hand
i
sha
do
nothing
with
they
turn
obstreperous
and
cram
my
now
i
want
soldiers
i
do
want
convicts
i
ca
let
stay
in
the
regulars
they
be
for
making
all
the
army
wildfire
like
i
just
draft
by
theirselves
treat
different
and
let
fire
away
they
got
good
stuff
in
though
too
much
of
the
curb
riles
well
sir
she
do
that
and
are
the
zephyrs
as
fine
a
lot
of
fellows
as
any
in
the
service
of
course
they
are
but
if
they
been
in
england
god
bless
her
the
dear
old
obstinate
soul
they
have
been
drove
crazy
along
o
pipeclay
and
razors
she
never
have
seed
what
was
in
her
eyes
are
so
bunged
up
with
routine
if
a
pup
riot
in
the
pack
she
no
notion
but
to
him
and
in
time
she
finds
herself
obliged
to
go
further
and
hang
him
she
do
ever
remember
that
it
may
be
only
just
along
of
his
breeding
and
that
he
may
make
a
very
good
hound
elseways
let
out
a
bit
though
he
spoil
the
whole
pack
if
she
will
be
a
fool
and
try
to
make
a
steady
of
him
straight
agin
his
rake
stopped
breathless
in
his
rhetoric
which
contained
more
truth
in
it
as
also
more
roughness
than
most
rhetoric
does
you
are
right
but
you
wander
from
my
question
said
cecil
gently
do
you
avoid
promotion
yes
sir
i
do
said
rake
something
sulkily
for
he
felt
he
was
being
driven
up
a
i
do
i
ai
not
one
bit
fitter
for
an
officer
than
that
rioting
pup
i
talk
on
is
fit
to
lead
them
crack
packs
at
home
i
should
be
in
a
if
i
was
promoted
and
as
for
the
cross
lord
sir
that
would
get
me
into
a
world
o
trouble
i
should
pawn
it
for
a
toss
of
wine
the
first
day
out
or
give
it
to
the
first
moukiera
that
winked
her
black
eye
for
it
the
star
put
on
my
buttons
suits
me
a
deal
better
if
you
believe
me
sir
it
the
star
on
the
metal
buttons
of
the
insubordinates
or
zephyrs
cecil
eyes
rested
on
him
with
a
look
that
said
far
more
than
his
answer
rake
i
know
you
better
than
you
would
let
me
do
if
you
had
your
way
my
noble
fellow
you
reject
advancement
and
earn
yourself
an
unjust
reputation
for
mutinous
conduct
because
you
are
too
generous
to
be
given
a
step
above
mine
in
the
who
been
you
that
trash
sir
retorted
rake
with
ferocity
no
matter
who
it
is
no
trash
it
is
a
splendid
loyalty
of
which
i
am
utterly
unworthy
and
it
shall
be
my
care
that
it
is
known
at
the
bureaus
so
that
henceforth
your
great
merits
may
be
stop
that
sir
cried
rake
vehemently
stow
that
if
you
please
promoted
i
wo
be
no
not
if
the
emperor
hisself
was
to
order
it
and
come
across
here
to
see
it
done
a
pretty
thing
surely
me
a
officer
and
you
never
a
one
me
of
you
and
you
of
me
by
the
lord
sir
we
might
as
well
see
the
in
state
and
the
marshals
out
the
not
at
all
this
army
has
not
a
finer
soldier
than
yourself
you
have
a
right
to
the
reward
of
your
services
in
it
and
i
assure
you
you
do
me
a
great
injustice
if
you
think
i
would
not
as
willingly
go
out
under
your
orders
as
under
those
of
all
the
marshals
of
the
the
tears
rushed
into
the
hardy
eyes
of
the
redoubtable
though
he
dashed
them
away
in
a
fury
of
eloquence
sir
if
you
do
understand
as
how
you
given
me
a
power
more
than
all
the
crosses
in
the
world
in
saying
of
them
there
words
why
you
do
know
me
much
either
that
all
you
a
gentleman
a
right
on
rare
thing
that
is
and
being
a
gentleman
you
be
too
generous
and
too
proud
like
not
to
behave
well
to
me
whether
i
was
you
as
i
always
served
you
or
of
you
by
riding
over
your
head
in
that
way
as
we
speaking
on
but
i
know
my
place
sir
and
i
know
yours
if
it
was
for
that
ere
black
hawk
damn
him
i
ca
help
it
sir
i
will
damn
him
if
he
shoot
me
for
it
you
been
a
chef
by
now
there
ai
the
leastest
doubt
of
it
ask
all
the
zigs
what
they
think
well
sir
now
you
know
i
a
man
what
do
as
i
say
if
you
do
let
me
have
my
own
way
and
if
you
do
the
littlest
thing
to
get
me
a
step
why
sir
i
swear
as
i
a
living
being
that
i
draw
on
chateauroy
the
first
time
i
see
him
afterward
and
slit
his
throat
as
i
slit
a
jackal
there
my
oath
took
and
cecil
saw
that
it
would
also
be
kept
the
natural
lawlessness
and
fiery
passion
inborn
in
rake
had
of
course
not
been
cooled
by
the
teaching
of
african
warfare
and
his
hate
was
intense
against
the
chief
of
his
regiment
as
intense
as
the
love
he
bore
to
the
man
whom
he
had
followed
out
into
exile
cecil
tried
vainly
to
argue
with
him
all
his
reasonings
fell
like
hailstones
on
a
cuirass
and
made
no
more
impression
he
was
resolute
but
listen
to
one
thing
he
urged
at
last
can
you
not
see
how
you
pain
me
by
this
if
i
knew
that
you
had
attained
a
higher
grade
and
wore
your
epaulettes
in
this
service
can
you
not
fancy
i
should
feel
pleasure
then
as
i
feel
regret
even
remorse
now
that
i
brought
you
to
africa
through
my
own
follies
and
misfortunes
do
you
sir
there
ai
the
least
cause
for
it
then
returned
rake
sturdily
lord
bless
you
sir
why
this
life
made
for
me
if
ever
a
round
peg
went
trim
and
neat
into
a
round
hole
it
was
when
i
came
into
this
here
army
i
never
was
so
happy
in
all
my
days
before
they
right
on
good
fellows
and
will
back
you
to
the
death
if
so
be
as
you
allays
been
with
as
a
zig
should
as
a
private
sir
i
happy
and
i
safe
as
a
officer
i
should
be
kicking
over
the
traces
and
blundering
everlastingly
however
there
ai
no
need
to
say
a
word
more
about
it
i
sworn
and
you
heerd
me
swear
sir
and
you
know
as
how
i
shall
keep
my
oath
if
ever
provoked
to
it
by
being
took
notice
of
i
stuck
that
spahi
just
now
just
by
way
of
a
lark
and
only
he
come
where
he
no
business
to
poke
his
turbaned
old
pate
likely
as
i
should
stop
at
giving
the
hawk
two
inches
of
steel
if
he
comes
such
a
insult
over
us
both
as
to
offer
a
blackguard
like
me
the
epaulettes
as
you
ought
to
be
and
cecil
knew
that
it
was
hopeless
either
to
persuade
him
to
his
own
advantage
or
to
convince
him
of
his
disobedience
in
speaking
thus
of
his
supreme
before
his
officer
he
was
himself
moreover
deeply
moved
by
the
man
fidelity
he
stretched
his
hand
out
i
wish
there
were
more
blackguards
with
hearts
like
yours
i
can
not
repay
your
love
rake
but
i
can
value
rake
put
his
own
hands
behind
his
back
god
bless
you
sir
you
repaid
it
ten
dozen
times
over
but
you
sha
do
that
sir
i
told
you
long
ago
i
too
much
of
a
scamp
some
day
perhaps
as
i
said
when
i
settled
scores
with
myself
and
wiped
off
all
the
bad
with
a
clear
sweep
tolerably
clean
not
afore
sir
and
rake
was
too
sturdily
obstinate
not
to
always
carry
his
point
the
love
that
he
bore
to
cecil
was
very
much
such
a
wild
chivalric
romantic
fidelity
as
the
cavaliers
or
the
gentlemen
of
the
north
bore
to
their
stuart
idols
that
his
benefactor
had
become
a
soldier
of
africa
in
no
way
lessened
the
reverent
love
of
his
loyalty
any
more
than
theirs
was
lessened
by
the
adversities
of
their
royal
masters
like
theirs
also
it
had
beauty
in
its
blindness
the
beauty
that
lies
in
every
pure
unselfishness
meanwhile
picpon
news
was
correct
the
regiments
were
ordered
out
on
the
march
there
was
fresh
war
in
the
interior
and
wherever
there
was
the
hottest
slaughter
there
the
black
hawk
always
flew
down
with
his
when
cecil
left
his
incorrigible
zig
the
trumpets
were
sounding
an
assembly
there
were
noise
tumult
eagerness
excitement
delighted
zest
on
every
side
a
general
order
was
read
to
the
enraptured
squadrons
they
were
to
leave
the
town
at
the
first
streak
of
dawn
there
were
before
them
death
deprivation
long
days
of
famine
long
days
of
drought
and
thirst
parching
roads
bitter
chilly
nights
fiery
of
sirocco
killing
pitiless
northern
winds
hunger
only
sharpened
by
a
snatch
of
raw
meat
or
a
handful
of
maize
and
the
probabilities
ten
to
one
of
being
thrust
under
the
sand
to
rot
or
left
to
have
their
skeletons
picked
clean
by
the
vultures
but
what
of
that
there
were
also
the
wild
delight
of
combat
the
freedom
of
lawless
warfare
the
joy
of
deep
strokes
thrust
home
the
chance
of
plunder
of
of
cattle
of
women
above
all
that
lust
for
slaughter
which
burns
so
deep
down
in
the
hidden
souls
of
men
and
gives
them
such
brotherhood
with
wolf
and
vulture
and
tiger
when
once
its
flame
bursts
forth
that
evening
at
the
villa
aioussa
there
gathered
a
courtly
assembly
of
much
higher
rank
than
algiers
can
commonly
afford
because
many
of
station
as
lofty
as
her
own
had
been
drawn
thither
to
follow
her
to
what
the
princesse
corona
called
her
banishment
an
endurable
banishment
enough
under
those
azure
skies
in
that
clear
elastic
air
and
with
that
charming
bonbonniere
in
which
to
dwell
yet
still
a
banishment
to
the
reigning
beauty
of
paris
to
one
who
had
the
habits
and
the
commands
of
a
wholly
undisputed
sovereignty
in
the
royal
splendor
of
her
womanhood
there
was
a
variety

the

there
was
wit
as
well
as
homage
whispered
in
her
ear
yet
she
was
not
altogether
amused
she
was
a
little
touched
with
ennui

very
stupid
they
have
not

she
thought
once
turning
from

she
smiled
a
little
furling
her

musing
on
the
horror
that
the
triad
of
fashionable
conquerors
near
her
would
feel
if
they
knew

the
african
day
was
at
its
noon
from
the
first
break
of
dawn
the
battle
had
raged
now
at
midday
it
was
at
its
height
far
in
the
interior
almost
on
the
edge
of
the
great
desert
in
that
terrible
season
when
air
that
is
flame
by
day
is
ice
by
night
and
when
the
scorch
of
a
blazing
sun
may
be
followed
in
an
hour
by
the
blinding
fury
of
a
the
slaughter
had
gone
on
hour
through
hour
under
a
shadowless
sky
blue
as
steel
hard
as
a
sheet
of
brass
the
arabs
had
surprised
the
french
encampment
where
it
lay
in
the
center
of
an
arid
plain
that
was
called
zaraila
hovering
like
a
cloud
of
hawks
on
the
entrance
of
the
sahara
massed
together
for
one
mighty
if
futile
effort
with
all
their
ancient
and
with
a
new
despair
the
tribes
who
refused
the
yoke
of
the
alien
empire
were
once
again
in
arms
were
once
again
combined
in
defense
of
those
limitless
kingdoms
of
drifting
sand
of
that
beloved
belt
of
bare
and
desolate
land
so
useless
to
the
conqueror
so
dear
to
the
nomad
when
they
had
been
as
it
had
been
thought
beaten
back
into
the
desert
wilderness
when
without
water
and
without
cattle
it
had
been
calculated
that
they
would
of
sheer
necessity
bow
themselves
in
submission
or
perish
of
famine
and
of
thirst
they
had
recovered
their
ardor
their
strength
their
resistance
their
power
to
harass
without
ceasing
if
they
could
never
arrest
the
enemy
they
had
cast
the
torch
of
war
afresh
into
the
land
and
here
southward
the
flame
burned
bitterly
and
with
a
merciless
tongue
devoured
the
lives
of
men
licking
them
up
as
a
forest
fire
the
dry
leaves
and
the
touchwood
circling
sweeping
silently
swiftly
with
that
rapid
spring
that
marvelous
whirlwind
of
force
that
is
of

and
of

had
rushed
down
in
the
darkness
of
night
lightly
as
a
kite
rushes
through
the
gloom
of
the
dawn
for
once
the
vigilance
of
the
invader
served
him
naught
for
once
the
frankish
camp
was
surprised
off
its
guard
while
the
air
was
still
chilly
with
the
breath
of
the
night
while
the
first
gleam
of
morning
had
barely
broken
through
the
mists
of
the
east
while
the
burned
through
the
dusky
gloom
and
the
sentinels
and
vedettes
paced
slowly
to
and
fro
and
circled
round
hearing
nothing
worse
than
the
stealthy
tread
of
the
jackal
or
the
muffled
flight
of
a
afar
in
the
south
a
great
dark
cloud
had
risen
darker
than
the
brooding
shadows
of
the
earth
and
sky
the
cloud
swept
onward
like
a
mass
of
cirrhi
in
those
shadows
shrouded
fleet
as
though
dense
as
though
it
moved
over
the
plains
as
it
grew
nearer
and
nearer
it
grew
grayer
a
changing
mass
of
white
and
black
that
fused
in
the
obscurity
into
a
shadow
color
a
dense
array
of
men
and
horses
flitting
noiselessly
like
spirits
and
as
though
guided
alone
by
one
rein
and
moved
alone
by
one
breath
and
one
will
not
a
bit
champed
not
a
loosened
not
a
shiver
of
steel
was
heard
as
silently
as
the
winds
of
the
desert
sweep
up
northward
over
the
plains
so
they
rode
now
host
upon
host
of
the
warriors
of
the
soil
the
outlying
vedettes
the
advancing
sentinels
had
scrutinized
so
long
through
the
night
every
wavering
shade
of
cloud
and
moving
form
of
buffalo
in
the
dim
distance
that
their
sleepless
eyes
strained
and
aching
failed
to
distinguish
this
moving
mass
that
was
so
like
the
brown
plains
and
starless
sky
that
it
could
scarce
be
told
from
them
the
night
too
was
bitter
northern
cold
cut
hardly
chillier
than
this
that
parted
the
blaze
of
one
hot
day
from
the
blaze
of
another
the
were
blowing
cruelly
keen
and
men
who
at
noon
gladly
stripped
to
their
shirts
shivered
now
where
they
lay
under
canvas
awake
while
his
comrades
slept
around
him
cecil
was
stretched
half
unharnessed
the
foraging
duty
of
the
past
hours
had
been
work
harassing
and
heavy
inglorious
and
full
of
fatigue
the
country
round
was
bare
as
a
the
poor
choked
with
dust
and
stones
unfed
as
yet
by
the
rains
or
snows
of
the
approaching
winter
the
horses
suffered
sorely
the
men
scarce
less
the
hay
for
the
former
was
scant
and
bad
the
rations
for
the
latter
often
cut
off
by
flying
skirmishers
of
the
foe
the
campaign
so
far
as
it
had
gone
had
been
fruitless
yet
had
cost
largely
in
human
life
the
men
died
rapidly
of
dysentery
disease
and
the
chills
of
the
nights
and
had
severe
losses
in
countless
obscure
skirmishes
that
served
no
end
except
to
water
the
african
soil
with
blood
true
france
would
fill
the
gaps
up
as
fast
as
they
occurred
and
the
monitor
would
only
allude
to
the
present
operations
when
it
could
give
a
flourishing
line
descriptive
of
the
arabs
being
driven
back
decimated
to
the
borders
of
the
sahara
but
as
the
flourish
of
the
monitor
would
never
reach
a
thousand
little
huts
and
cabins
and
sunny
nests
where
the
memory
of
some
lad
who
had
gone
forth
never
to
return
would
leave
a
deadly
shadow
athwart
the
humble
threshold
so
the
knowledge
that
they
were
only
so
many
automata
in
the
hands
of
government
whose
loss
would
merely
be
noted
that
it
might
be
efficiently
supplied
was
not
that
of
la
gloire
which
poured
the
strength
and
the
daring
of
gods
into
the
limbs
of
the
men
of
jena
and
of
austerlitz
still
there
was
a
in
them
and
there
was
the
fire
of
france
they
fought
not
less
superbly
here
where
to
be
food
for
jackal
and
kite
was
their
likeliest
doom
than
their
sires
had
done
under
the
eagles
of
the
first
empire
when
the
conscript
hero
of
was
the
glittering
marshal
of
cecil
had
awakened
while
the
camp
still
slept
do
what
he
would
force
himself
into
the
fullness
of
this
fierce
and
hard
existence
as
he
might
he
could
not
burn
out
or
banish
a
thing
that
had
many
a
time
haunted
him
but
never
as
it
did
now
the
remembrance
of
a
woman
he
almost
laughed
as
he
lay
there
on
a
pile
of
rotting
straw
and
wrung
the
truth
out
of
his
own
heart
that
he
a
soldier
of
these
exiled
squadrons
was
mad
enough
to
love
that
woman
whose
deep
proud
eyes
had
dwelt
with
such
serene
pity
upon
him
yet
his
hand
clinched
on
the
straw
as
it
had
clinched
once
when
the
operator
knife
had
cut
down
through
the
bones
of
his
breast
to
reach
a
bullet
that
left
in
his
chest
would
have
been
death
if
in
the
sight
of
men
he
had
only
stood
in
the
rank
that
was
his
by
birthright
he
could
have
striven
for
it
might
be
that
he
could
have
roused
some
answering
passion
in
her
but
that
chance
was
lost
to
him
forever
well
it
was
but
one
thing
more
that
was
added
to
all
that
he
had
of
his
own
will
given
up
he
was
dead
he
must
be
content
as
the
dead
must
be
to
leave
the
warmth
of
kisses
the
glow
of
delight
the
possession
of
a
woman
loveliness
the
homage
of
men
honor
the
gladness
of
successful
desires
to
those
who
still
lived
in
the
light
he
had
quitted
he
had
never
allowed
himself
the
emasculating
indulgence
of
regret
he
flung
it
off
him
now
coiled
asleep
in
his
bosom
thrilled
stirred
and
growled
he
rose
and
with
the
little
dog
under
his
arm
looked
out
from
the
canvas
he
knew
that
the
most
vigilant
sentry
in
the
service
had
not
the
instinct
for
a
foe
afar
off
that
possessed
he
gazed
keenly
southward
the
poodle
growling
on
that
cloud
so
dim
so
distant
caught
his
sight
was
it
a
moving
herd
a
shifting
mist
a
between
the
night
and
dawn
for
a
moment
longer
he
watched
it
then
what
it
was
he
knew
or
felt
by
such
strong
instinct
as
makes
knowledge
and
like
the
blast
of
a
clarion
his
alarm
rang
over
the
unarmed
and
slumbering
camp
an
instant
and
the
hive
of
men
so
still
so
motionless
broke
into
violent
movement
and
from
the
tents
the
sleepers
poured
wakened
and
fresh
in
wakening
as
hounds
perfect
discipline
did
the
rest
with
marvelous
with
matchless
swiftness
and
precision
they
harnessed
and
got
under
arms
they
were
but
fifteen
hundred
or
so
in
all
a
single
squadron
of
chasseurs
two
battalions
of
zouaves
half
a
corps
of
tirailleurs
and
some
turcos
only
a
branch
of
the
main
body
and
without
artillery
but
they
were
some
of
the
flower
of
the
army
of
algiers
and
they
roused
in
a
second
with
the
vivacious
ferocity
of
the
bounding
tiger
with
the
glad
eager
impatience
for
the
slaughter
of
the
unloosed
hawk
yet
rapid
in
its
wondrous
celerity
as
their
united
action
was
it
was
not
so
rapid
as
the
downward
sweep
of
the
that
came
so
near
with
the
tossing
of
white
draperies
and
the
shine
of
countless
sabers
now
growing
clearer
and
clearer
out
of
the
darkness
till
with
a
whir
like
the
noise
of
an
eagle
wings
and
a
swoop
like
an
eagle
seizure
the
arabs
whirled
down
upon
them
met
a
few
yards
in
advance
by
the
answering
charge
of
the
light
cavalry
there
was
a
crash
as
if
rock
were
hurled
upon
rock
as
the
chasseurs
scarce
seated
in
saddle
rushed
forward
to
save
the
pickets
to
encounter
the
first
blind
force
of
attack
and
to
give
the
infantry
further
in
more
time
for
harness
and
defense
out
of
the
caverns
of
the
night
an
armed
multitude
seemed
to
have
suddenly
poured
a
moment
ago
they
had
slept
in
security
now
thousands
on
thousands
whom
they
could
not
number
whom
they
could
but
dimly
even
perceive
were
thrown
on
them
in
immeasurable
hosts
which
the
encircling
cloud
of
dust
served
but
to
render
vaster
ghastlier
and
more
majestic
the
arab
line
stretched
out
with
wings
that
seemed
to
extend
on
and
on
without
end
the
line
of
the
chasseurs
was
not
its
length
they
were
but
a
single
squadron
flung
in
their
stirrups
scarcely
clothed
knowing
only
that
the
foe
was
upon
them
caring
only
that
their
were
hard
on
their
weapons
with
all
the
elan
of
france
they
launched
themselves
forward
to
break
the
rush
of
the
desert
horses
they
met
with
a
terrible
sound
like
falling
trees
like
clashing
metal
the
hoofs
of
the
rearing
chargers
struck
each
other
breasts
and
these
bit
and
tore
at
each
other
manes
while
their
riders
reeled
down
dead
frank
and
arab
were
blent
in
one
inextricable
mass
as
the
charging
squadrons
encountered
the
outer
wings
of
the
tribes
were
spared
the
shock
and
swept
on
to
meet
the
bayonets
of
zouaves
and
turcos
as
at
their
swift
the
enfants
perdus
of
france
threw
themselves
forward
from
the
darkness
the
cavalry
was
enveloped
in
the
overwhelming
numbers
of
the
center
and
the
flanks
seemed
to
cover
the
zouaves
and
tirailleurs
as
some
great
settling
mist
may
cover
the
cattle
who
move
beneath
it
it
was
not
a
battle
it
was
a
frightful
tangling
of
men
and
brutes
no
contest
of
modern
warfare
such
as
commences
and
conquers
by
a
duel
of
artillery
and
sometimes
gives
the
victory
to
whosoever
has
the
superiority
of
ordnance
but
a
conflict
hand
to
hand
breast
to
breast
life
for
life
a
homeric
combat
of
spear
and
of
sword
even
while
the
first
volleys
of
the
answering
musketry
pealed
over
the
plain
for
once
the
desert
avenged
in
like
that
terrible
inexhaustibility
of
supply
wherewith
the
empire
so
long
had
crushed
them
beneath
the
overwhelming
difference
of
numbers
it
was
the
day
of
mazagran
once
more
as
the
light
of
the
morning
broke
gray
silvered
beautiful
in
the
far
dim
distance
beyond
the
tawny
seas
of
reeds
smoke
and
sand
soon
densely
rose
above
the
struggle
white
hot
blinding
but
out
from
it
the
lean
dark
bedouin
faces
the
snowy
haicks
the
red
burnous
the
gleam
of
the
tunisian
muskets
the
flash
of
the
yataghans
were
seen
fused
in
a
mass
with
the
brawny
naked
necks
of
the
zouaves
with
the
shine
of
the
french
bayonets
with
the
tossing
manes
and
glowing
nostrils
of
the
chasseurs
horses
with
the
torn
stained
silk
of
the
raised
tricolor
through
which
the
storm
of
balls
flew
thick
and
fast
as
hail
yet
whose
folds
were
never
suffered
to
fall
though
again
and
again
the
hand
that
held
its
staff
was
cut
away
or
was
unloosed
in
death
yet
ever
found
another
to
take
its
charge
before
the
flag
could
once
have
trembled
in
the
enemy
sight
the
chasseurs
could
not
charge
they
were
hemmed
in
packed
between
bodies
of
horsemen
that
pressed
them
together
as
between
iron
plates
now
and
then
they
could
cut
their
way
through
clear
enough
to
reach
their
comrades
of
the
but
as
often
as
they
did
so
so
often
the
overwhelming
numbers
of
the
arabs
urged
in
on
them
afresh
like
a
flood
and
closed
upon
them
and
drove
them
back
every
soldier
in
the
squadron
that
lived
kept
his
life
by
sheer
breathless
ceaseless
hewing
right
and
left
front
and
rear
without
pause
as
in
the
great
tangled
forests
of
the
west
men
hew
aside
branch
and
brushwood
ere
they
can
force
one
step
forward
the
gleam
of
the
dawn
spread
in
one
golden
glow
of
morning
and
the
day
rose
radiant
over
the
world
they
stayed
not
for
its
beauty
or
its
peace
the
carnage
went
on
hour
upon
hour
men
began
to
grow
drunk
with
slaughter
as
with
raki
it
was
sublimely
grand
it
was
hideously
hateful
this
struggle
this
heaving
tumult
of
striving
lives
that
ever
and
anon
stirred
the
vast
of
smoke
and
broke
from
it
as
the
lightning
from
the
night
the
sun
laughed
in
its
warmth
over
a
thousand
hills
and
streams
over
the
blue
seas
lying
northward
and
over
the
yellow
sands
of
the
south
but
the
touch
of
its
heat
only
made
the
flame
in
their
blood
burn
fiercer
the
fullness
of
its
light
only
served
to
show
them
clearer
where
to
strike
and
how
to
slay
it
was
bitter
stifling
cruel
work
with
their
mouths
choked
with
sand
with
their
throats
caked
with
thirst
with
their
eyes
blind
with
smoke
cramped
as
in
a
vise
scorched
with
the
blaze
of
powder
covered
with
blood
and
with
dust
while
the
steel
was
thrust
through
nerve
and
sinew
or
the
shot
plowed
through
bone
and
flesh
the
answering
fire
of
the
zouaves
and
tirailleurs
kept
the
arabs
further
at
bay
and
mowed
them
faster
down
but
in
the
chasseurs
quarter
of
the
field
parted
from
the
rest
of
their
comrades
as
they
had
been
by
the
rush
of
that
broken
charge
with
which
they
had
sought
to
save
the
camp
and
arrest
the
foe
the
worst
pressure
of
the
attack
was
felt
and
the
fiercest
of
the
slaughter
fell
the
chef
had
been
shot
dead
as
they
had
first
swept
out
to
encounter
the
advance
of
the
desert
horsemen
one
by
one
the
officers
had
been
cut
down
singled
out
by
the
keen
eyes
of
their
enemies
and
throwing
themselves
into
the
deadliest
of
the
carnage
with
the
impetuous
characteristic
of
their
service
at
the
last
there
remained
but
a
mere
handful
out
of
all
the
brilliant
squadron
that
had
galloped
down
in
the
gray
of
the
dawn
to
meet
the
whirlwind
of
arab
fury
at
their
head
was
cecil
two
horses
had
been
killed
under
him
and
he
had
thrown
himself
afresh
across
unwounded
chargers
whose
riders
had
fallen
in
the
melee
and
at
whose
bridles
he
had
caught
as
he
shook
himself
free
of
the
dead
animals
stirrups
his
head
was
uncovered
his
uniform
hurriedly
thrown
on
had
been
torn
aside
and
his
chest
was
bare
to
the
red
folds
of
his
sash
he
was
drenched
with
blood
not
his
own
that
had
rained
on
him
as
he
fought
and
his
face
and
his
hands
were
black
with
smoke
and
with
powder
he
could
not
see
a
yard
in
front
of
him
he
could
not
tell
how
the
day
went
anywhere
save
in
that
corner
where
his
own
troop
was
hemmed
in
as
fast
as
they
beat
the
arabs
back
and
forced
themselves
some
clearer
space
so
fast
the
tribes
closed
in
afresh
no
orders
reached
him
from
the
general
of
the
brigade
in
command
except
for
the
of
the
zouaves
that
ever
and
again
rang
above
the
din
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
french
battalions
were
not
cut
utterly
to
pieces
under
the
immense
numerical
superiority
of
their
foes
all
he
could
see
was
that
every
officer
of
chasseurs
was
down
and
that
unless
he
took
the
vacant
place
and
rallied
them
together
the
few
score
troopers
that
were
still
left
would
scatter
confused
and
demoralized
as
the
best
soldiers
will
at
times
when
they
can
see
no
chief
to
follow
he
spurred
the
horse
he
had
just
mounted
against
the
dense
crowd
opposing
him
against
the
hard
black
wall
of
dust
and
smoke
and
steel
and
savage
faces
and
lean
swarthy
arms
which
were
all
that
his
eyes
could
see
and
that
seemed
impenetrable
as
granite
moving
and
changing
though
it
was
he
thrust
the
gray
against
it
while
he
waved
his
sword
above
his
head
en
avant
mes
freres
france
france
france
his
voice
well
known
well
loved
thrilled
the
hearts
of
his
comrades
and
brought
them
together
like
a
they
had
gone
with
him
many
a
time
into
the
hell
of
battle
into
the
jaws
of
death
they
surged
about
him
now
striking
thrusting
forcing
with
blows
of
their
sabers
or
their
lances
and
blows
of
their
beasts
a
passage
one
to
another
until
they
were
reunited
once
more
as
one
troop
while
their
shrill
shouts
like
an
oath
of
vengeance
echoed
after
him
in
the
defiance
that
has
pealed
victorious
over
so
many
fields
from
the
soldiery
of
france
they
loved
him
he
had
called
them
his
brethren
they
were
like
lambs
for
him
to
lead
like
tigers
for
him
to
incite
they
could
scarcely
see
his
face
in
that
great
red
mist
of
combat
in
that
horrible
stifling
pressure
on
every
side
that
jammed
them
as
if
they
were
in
a
press
of
iron
and
gave
them
no
power
to
pause
though
their
animals
hoofs
struck
the
lingering
life
out
of
some
comrade
or
trampled
over
the
writhing
limbs
of
the
they
loved
dearest
and
best
but
his
voice
reached
them
clear
and
ringing
in
its
appeal
for
sake
of
the
country
they
never
once
forgot
or
once
reviled
though
in
her
name
they
were
starved
and
beaten
like
rebellious
hounds
though
in
her
cause
they
were
exiled
all
their
manhood
through
under
the
sun
of
this
cruel
ravenous
burning
africa
they
could
see
him
lift
aloft
the
eagle
he
had
caught
from
the
last
hand
that
had
borne
it
the
golden
gleam
of
the
young
morning
flashing
like
flame
upon
the
brazen
wings
and
they
shouted
as
with
one
throat
mazagran
mazagran
as
the
battalion
of
mazagran
had
died
keeping
the
ground
through
the
whole
of
the
scorching
day
while
the
fresh
hordes
poured
down
on
them
like
ceaseless
torrents
and
exhaustless
so
they
were
ready
to
hold
the
ground
here
until
of
all
their
numbers
there
should
be
left
not
one
living
man
he
glanced
back
on
them
guarding
his
head
the
while
from
the
lances
that
were
rained
on
him
and
he
lifted
the
guidon
higher
and
higher
till
out
of
the
ruck
and
the
throng
the
brazen
bird
caught
afresh
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
then
like
arrows
launched
at
once
from
a
hundred
bows
they
charged
he
still
slightly
in
advance
of
them
the
bridle
flung
upon
his
neck
his
head
and
breast
bare
one
hand
striking
aside
with
his
blade
the
steel
shafts
as
they
poured
on
him
the
other
holding
high
above
the
press
the
eagle
of
the
bonapartes
the
effort
was
superb
dense
bodies
of
arabs
parted
them
in
the
front
from
the
camp
where
the
battle
raged
harassed
them
in
the
rear
with
flying
shots
and
hurled
lances
and
forced
down
on
them
on
either
side
like
the
closing
jaws
of
a
trap
the
impetuosity
of
their
onward
movement
was
for
the
moment
irresistible
it
bore
headlong
all
before
it
the
desert
horses
recoiled
and
the
desert
riders
themselves
yielded
crushed
staggered
trodden
aside
struck
aside
by
the
tremendous
impetus
with
which
the
chasseurs
were
thrown
upon
them
for
the
moment
the
bedouins
gave
way
shaken
and
confused
as
at
the
head
of
the
french
they
saw
this
man
with
his
hair
blowing
in
the
wind
and
the
sun
on
the
fairness
of
his
face
ride
down
on
them
thus
unharmed
though
a
dozen
spears
were
aimed
at
his
naked
breast
dealing
strokes
sure
as
death
right
and
left
as
he
went
with
the
light
from
the
hot
blue
skies
on
the
ensign
of
france
that
he
bore
they
knew
him
they
had
met
him
in
many
conflicts
and
wherever
the
fair
frank
as
they
called
him
came
there
they
knew
of
old
the
battle
was
hard
to
win
bitter
to
the
bitterest
end
whether
that
end
were
defeat
or
victory
costly
as
defeat
in
its
achievement
and
for
the
moment
they
recoiled
under
the
shock
of
that
fiery
onslaught
for
the
moment
they
parted
and
wavered
and
oscillated
beneath
the
impetus
with
which
he
hurled
his
hundred
chasseurs
on
them
with
that
light
swift
indescribable
rapidity
and
resistlessness
of
attack
characteristic
of
the
african
cavalry
though
a
score
or
more
one
on
another
had
singled
him
out
with
special
and
violent
attack
he
had
gone
as
yet
unwounded
save
for
a
in
his
shoulder
of
which
in
the
heat
of
the
conflict
he
was
unconscious
the
fighting
fury
was
upon
him
and
when
once
this
had
been
lit
in
him
the
arabs
knew
of
old
that
the
fiercest
vulture
in
the
frankish
ranks
never
struck
so
surely
home
as
his
hand
as
he
spurred
his
horse
down
on
them
now
twenty
blades
glittered
against
him
the
foremost
would
have
cut
straight
down
through
the
bone
of
his
bared
chest
and
killed
him
at
a
single
lunge
but
as
its
steel
flashed
in
the
sun
one
of
his
troopers
threw
himself
against
it
and
parried
the
stroke
from
him
by
sheathing
it
in
his
own
breast
the
blow
was
mortal
and
the
one
who
had
saved
him
reeled
down
off
his
saddle
under
the
hoofs
of
the
trampling
chargers
picpon
souvient
he
murmured
with
a
smile
and
as
the
charge
swept
onward
cecil
with
a
great
cry
of
horror
saw
the
feet
of
the
maddened
horses
strike
to
pulp
the
writhing
body
and
saw
the
black
wistful
eyes
of
the
enfant
de
paris
look
upward
to
him
once
with
love
and
fealty
and
unspeakable
sweetness
gleaming
through
their
darkened
sight
but
to
pause
was
impossible
though
the
french
horses
were
forced
with
marvelous
dexterity
through
a
bristling
forest
of
steel
though
the
remnant
of
the
squadron
was
cast
against
them
in
as
headlong
a
daring
as
if
it
had
half
the
regiments
of
the
empire
at
its
back
the
charge
availed
little
against
the
hosts
of
the
desert
that
had
rallied
and
swooped
down
afresh
almost
as
soon
as
they
had
been
for
the
instant
of
the
shock
the
hatred
of
the
opposed
races
was
aroused
in
all
its
blind
ravening
passion
the
conquered
had
the
conquering
nation
for
once
at
their
mercy
for
once
at
tremendous
disadvantage
on
neither
side
was
there
aught
except
that
one
instinct
for
slaughter
which
once
awakened
kills
every
other
in
the
breast
in
which
it
burns
the
arabs
had
cruel
years
to
avenge
years
of
a
loathed
tyranny
years
of
starvation
and
oppression
years
of
constant
flight
southward
with
no
choice
but
submission
or
death
they
had
deadly
memories
to
wash
out
memories
of
brethren
who
had
been
killed
like
carrion
by
the
invaders
shot
and
steel
of
nomadic
freedom
begrudged
and
crushed
by
civilization
of
young
children
murdered
in
the
darkness
of
the
caverns
with
the
sulphurous
smoke
choking
the
innocent
throats
that
had
only
breathed
the
golden
air
of
a
few
summers
of
women
well
beloved
torn
from
them
in
the
hot
flames
of
burning
tents
and
outraged
before
their
eyes
with
insult
whose
end
was
a
into
their
breasts
breasts
whose
sin
was
fidelity
to
the
vanquished
they
had
vengeance
to
do
that
made
every
stroke
seem
righteous
and
holy
in
their
sight
that
nerved
each
of
their
bare
and
sinewy
arms
as
with
the
strength
of
a
thousand
limbs
right
so
barren
so
hopeless
so
unavailing
had
long
been
with
them
now
to
it
was
added
at
last
the
power
of
might
and
they
exercised
the
power
with
the
savage
ruthlessness
of
the
desert
they
closed
in
on
every
side
wheeling
their
swift
coursers
hither
and
thither
striking
with
lance
and
blade
hemming
in
beyond
escape
the
doomed
fragment
of
the
frankish
squadron
till
there
remained
of
them
but
one
small
nucleus
driven
close
together
rather
as
infantry
will
form
than
as
cavalry
usually
does
a
ring
of
horsemen
of
which
every
one
had
his
face
to
the
foe
a
solid
circle
curiously
wedged
one
against
the
other
with
the
bodies
of
chargers
and
of
men
deep
around
them
and
with
the
ground
soaked
with
blood
till
the
sand
was
one
red
morass
cecil
held
the
eagle
still
and
looked
round
on
the
few
left
to
him
you
are
sons
of
the
old
guard
die
like
they
answered
with
a
pealing
cry
terrible
as
the
cry
of
the
lion
in
the
hush
of
night
but
a
shout
that
had
in
it
assent
triumph
fealty
victory
even
as
they
obeyed
him
and
drew
up
to
die
while
in
their
front
was
the
young
brow
of
petit
picpon
turned
upward
to
the
glare
of
the
skies
there
was
nothing
for
them
but
to
draw
up
thus
and
await
their
butchery
defending
the
eagle
to
the
last
looking
till
the
last
toward
that
woman
face
of
their
leader
as
they
had
often
termed
it
that
was
to
them
now
as
the
face
of
napoleon
was
to
the
soldiers
who
loved
him
there
was
a
pause
brief
as
is
the
pause
of
the
lungs
to
take
a
fuller
breath
the
arabs
honored
these
men
who
alone
and
in
the
midst
of
the
hostile
force
held
their
ground
and
prepared
thus
to
be
slaughtered
one
by
one
till
of
all
the
squadron
that
had
ridden
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
dawn
there
should
be
only
a
black
huddled
stiffened
heap
of
dead
men
and
of
dead
beasts
the
chief
who
led
them
pressed
them
back
withholding
them
from
the
end
that
was
so
near
to
their
hands
when
they
should
stretch
that
single
ring
of
horsemen
all
lifeless
in
the
dust
you
are
great
warriors

cried
in
the
sabir
tongue

looked
back
once
more
on
the
fragment
of
his
troop
and
raised
the
eagle
higher
aloft
where
the
wings
should
glisten
in
the
fuller
day
half
naked
scorched
blinded
with
an
open
gash
in
his
shoulder
where
the
lance
had
struck
and
with
his
brow
wet
with
the
great
dews
of
the
and
the
breathless
toil
his
eyes
were
clear
as
they
flashed
with
the
light
of
the
sun
in
them
his
mouth
smiled
as
he
answered

we
shown
ourselves
cowards
that
you
think
we
shall
yield

of
wild

in

even
if
they
be
but
legendary
are
too
true
to
the
spirit
of
the
soldiers
of
france
not
to
be
as
truth
in
their
sight
then
with
their
swords
above
their
heads
they
waited
for
the
collision
of
the
terrible
attack
which
would
fall
on
them
upon
every
side
and
strike
all
the
sentient
life
out
of
them
before
the

came
with

with

himself
on

leopard

tribes
pressing
on

the

for
miles
along
the

the

of

with
horses

mademoiselle
you
saved
the
honor
of

in
the

the

and
hot
into

tears
of
pride
she
was
but
a
child
still
in

and

could
be
moved
by
the
name
of
france
as
other
children
by
the
name
of
their
mothers
chut
i
did
nothing
she
said
rapidly
i
only
rode
the
frenzied
hurrahs
of
the
men
who
heard
her
drowned
her
words
they
loved
her
for
what
she
had
done
they
loved
her
better
still
because
she
set
no
count
on
it
the
empire
will
think
otherwise
said
the
major
of
the
zouaves
tell
me
my
little
one
how
did
you
do
this
thing
cigarette
balancing
herself
with
a
foot
on
either
shoulder
of
her
supporters
gave
the
salute
and
answered
simply
mon
commandant
very
simply
i
was
alone
riding
midway
between
you
and
the
main
army
three
leagues
say
from
each
i
was
all
alone
only
flying
with
me
for
fun
i
met
a
colon
i
knew
the
man
for
the
matter
of
that
i
did
him
once
a
service
saved
his
geese
and
his
fowls
from
burning
one
winter
day
in
their
house
while
he
wrung
his
hands
and
looked
on
well
he
was
full
of
terror
and
told
me
there
was
fighting
yonder
here
he
meant
so
i
rode
nearer
to
see
that
was
just
upon
sunrise
i
dismounted
and
ran
up
a
palm
and
cigarette
pointed
to
a
slope
crowned
with
the
remains
of
a
once
mighty
palm
forest
i
got
up
very
high
i
could
see
miles
round
i
saw
how
things
were
with
you
for
the
moment
i
was
coming
straight
to
you
then
i
thought
i
should
do
more
service
if
i
let
the
main
army
know
and
brought
you
a
i
rode
fast
dieu
i
rode
fast
my
horse
dropped
under
me
twice
but
i
reached
them
at
last
and
i
went
at
once
to
the
general
he
guessed
at
a
glance
how
things
were
and
i
told
him
to
give
me
my
spahis
and
let
me
go
so
he
did
i
got
on
the
mare
of
his
own
staff
and
away
we
came
it
was
a
near
thing
if
we
had
been
a
minute
later
it
had
been
all
up
with
true
indeed
muttered
the
zouave
in
his
beard
a
superb
action
my
little
one
but
did
you
meet
no
arab
scouts
to
stop
you
cigarette
laughed
did
i
not
met
them
by
dozens
some
had
a
shot
at
me
some
had
a
shot
from
me
one
fellow
nearly
winged
me
but
i
got
through
them
all
somehow
sapristi
i
galloped
so
fast
i
was
very
hard
to
hit
flying
these
things
only
require
a
little
judgment
but
some
men
pardi
always
are
creeping
when
they
should
fly
and
always
are
scampering
when
they
should
saunter
and
then
they
wonder
when
they
make
fiasco
bah
and
cigarette
laughed
again
men
were
such
bunglers
ouf
mademoiselle
if
all
soldiers
were
like
you
answered
the
major
of
zouaves
curtly
to
command
a
battalion
would
be
paradise
all
soldiers
would
do
anything
i
have
done
retorted
cigarette
who
never
took
a
compliment
at
the
expense
of
her
they
do
not
all
get
the
opportunity
look
you
opportunity
is
a
little
angel
some
catch
him
as
he
goes
some
let
him
pass
by
forever
you
must
be
quick
with
him
for
he

all

down

and
cigarette
uncovered
her
curly
head
reverentially
as
at
the
name
of
a
deity
napoleon
would
have
given
him
his
brigade
ere
this
if
you
had
seen
him

justice
done

and
the
chef
de
bataillon
saluted
her
once
more
and
turned
away
to
view
the
plain
and
number
the
few
who
remained
out
of
those
who
had
been
wakened
by
the
clash
of
the
arab
arms
in
the
gray
of
the
earliest
dawn
cigarette
eyes
flashed
like
sun
playing
on
water
and
her
flushed
cheeks
grew
scarlet
since
her
infancy
it
had
been
her
dream
to
have
the
cross
to
have
the
grande
croix
to
lie
above
her
little
lion
heart
it
had
been
the
one
longing
the
one
ambition
the
only
undying
desire
of
her
soul
and
lo
she
touched
its
realization
the
wild
frantic
tumultuous
cheers
and
caresses
of
her
soldiery
who
could
not
triumph
in
her
and
triumph
with
her
enough
to
satiate
them
recalled
her
to
the
actual
moment
she
sprang
down
from
her
elevation
and
turned
on
them
with
a
rebuke
ah
you
are
making
this
fuss
about
me
while
hundreds
of
better
soldiers
than
i
lie
yonder
let
us
look
to
them
first
we
will
play
the
fool
and
though
she
had
ridden
fifty
miles
that
day
if
she
had
ridden
one
though
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
sunrise
and
had
only
had
one
draught
of
bad
water
though
she
was
tired
and
stiff
and
bruised
and
parched
with
thirst
cigarette
dashed
off
as
lightly
as
a
young
goat
to
look
for
the
wounded
and
the
dying
men
who
strewed
the
plain
far
and
near
she
remembered
one
whom
she
had
not
seen
after
that
first
moment
in
which
she
had
given
the
word
to
the
squadrons
to
charge
it
was
a
terrible
sight
the
arid
plain
lying
in
the
scarlet
glow
of
sunset
covered
with
dead
bodies
with
mutilated
limbs
with
horses
gasping
and
writhing
with
men
raving
like
mad
creatures
in
the
torture
of
their
wounds
it
was
a
sight
which
always
went
to
her
heart
she
was
a
true
soldier
and
though
she
could
deal
death
pitilessly
could
when
the
delirium
of
war
was
over
tend
and
yield
infinite
compassion
to
those
who
were
in
suffering
but
such
scenes
had
been
familiar
to
her
from
the
earliest
years
when
on
an
infant
limbs
she
had
toddled
over
such
battlefields
and
wound
tiny
hands
in
the
hair
of
some
dead
trooper
who
had
given
her
sweetmeats
the
hour
before
vainly
trying
to
awaken
him
and
she
went
through
all
the
intense
misery
and
desolation
of
the
scene
now
without
shrinking
and
with
that
fearless
tender
devotion
to
the
wounded
which
cigarette
showed
in
common
with
other
soldiers
of
her
nation
being
like
them
a
young
lion
in
the
combat
but
a
creature
unspeakably
gentle
and
full
of
sympathy
when
the
fury
of
the
fight
was
over
she
had
seen
great
slaughter
often
enough
but
even
she
had
not
seen
any
struggle
more
close
more
murderous
than
this
had
been
the
dead
lay
by
hundreds
french
and
arab
locked
in
one
another
limbs
as
they
had
fallen
when
the
ordinary
mode
of
warfare
had
failed
to
satiate
their
violence
and
they
had
wrestled
together
like
wolves
fighting
and
rending
each
other
over
a
disputed
carcass
the
bitterness
and
the
hatred
of
the
contest
were
shown
in
the
fact
that
there
were
very
few
merely
wounded
or
disabled
almost
all
the
numbers
that
strewed
the
plain
were
dead
it
had
been
a
and
but
for
her
arrival
with
the
fresh
squadrons
not
one
among
her
countrymen
would
have
lived
to
tell
the
story
of
this
terrible
duello
which
had
been
as
magnificent
in
heroism
as
any
austerlitz
or
gemappes
but
which
would
pass
unhonored
almost
unnamed
among
the
futile
fruitless
heroisms
of
algerian
warfare
is
he
killed
is
he
killed
she
thought
as
she
bent
over
each
knot
of
motionless
bodies
where
here
and
there
some
faint
stifled
breath
or
some
moan
of
agony
told
that
life
still
lingered
beneath
the
huddled
stiffening
heap
and
a
tightness
came
at
her
heart
an
aching
fear
made
her
shrink
as
she
raised
each
hidden
face
that
she
had
never
known
before
what
if
he
be
she
said
fiercely
to
herself
it
is
nothing
to
me
i
hate
him
the
cold
aristocrat
i
ought
to
be
glad
if
i
see
him
lie
but
despite
her
hatred
for
him
she
could
not
banish
that
hot
feverish
hope
that
cold
suffocating
fear
which
turn
by
turn
quickened
and
slackened
the
bright
flow
of
her
warm
young
blood
as
she
searched
among
the
slain
ah
le
pauvre
picpon
she
said
softly
as
she
reached
at
last
the
place
where
the
young
chasseur
lay
and
lifted
the
black
curls
off
his
forehead
the
hoofs
of
the
charging
cavalry
had
cruelly
struck
and
trampled
his
frame
the
back
had
been
broken
and
the
body
had
been
mashed
as
in
a
mortar
under
the
thundering
gallop
of
the
horse
but
the
face
was
still
uninjured
and
had
a
strange
pathetic
beauty
a
calm
and
smiling
courage
on
it
it
was
ashen
pale
but
the
great
black
eyes
that
had
glistened
in
such
malicious
mirth
and
sparkled
in
such
malignant
mischief
during
life
were
open
and
had
a
mournful
pitiful
serenity
in
their
look
as
if
from
their
depths
the
soul
still
gazed
that
soul
which
had
been
neglected
and
cursed
and
left
to
wander
among
evil
ways
yet
which
through
all
its
darkness
all
its
ignorance
had
reached
unguided
to
love
and
to
nobility
cigarette
closed
their
long
black
lashes
down
on
the
white
cheeks
with
soft
and
reverent
touch
she
had
seen
that
look
ere
now
on
the
upturned
faces
of
the
dead
who
had
strewn
the
barricades
of
paris
with
the
words
of
the
marseillaise
the
last
upon
their
lips
to
her
there
could
be
no
fate
fairer
no
glory
more
glorious
than
this
of
his
to
die
for
france
and
she
laid
him
gently
down
and
left
him
and
went
on
with
her
quest
it
was
here
that
she
had
lost
sight
of
cecil
as
they
had
charged
together
and
her
mare
enraged
and
intoxicated
with
noise
and
terror
had
torn
away
at
full
speed
that
had
outstripped
even
the
swiftest
of
her
spahis
a
little
farther
on
a
dog
moan
caught
her
ear
she
turned
and
looked
across
upright
among
a
ghastly
pile
of
men
and
chargers
sat
the
small
snowy
poodle
of
the
chasseurs
beating
the
air
with
its
little
paws
as
it
had
been
taught
to
do
when
it
needed
anything
and
howling
piteously
as
it
begged
what
is
it
she
cried
to
him
while
with
a
bound
she
reached
the
spot
the
dog
leaped
on
her
rejoicing
the
dead
were
thick
there
ten
or
twelve
deep
french
trooper
and
bedouin
rider
flung
across
each
other
horribly
entangled
with
the
limbs
the
manes
the
shattered
bodies
of
their
own
horses
among
them
she
saw
the
face
she
sought
as
the
dog
eagerly
ran
back
caressing
the
hair
of
a
soldier
who
lay
underneath
the
weight
of
his
gray
charger
that
had
been
killed
by
a
cigarette
grew
very
pale
as
she
had
never
grown
when
the
hailstorm
of
shots
had
been
pouring
on
her
in
the
midst
of
a
battle
but
with
the
rapid
skill
and
strength
she
had
acquired
long
before
she
reached
the
place
lifted
aside
first
one
then
another
of
the
lifeless
arabs
that
had
fallen
above
him
and
drew
out
from
beneath
the
suffocating
pressure
of
his
horse
weight
the
head
and
the
frame
of
the
chasseur
whom
had
sought
out
and
guarded
for
a
moment
she
thought
him
dead
then
as
she
drew
him
out
where
the
cooled
breeze
of
the
declining
day
could
reach
him
a
slow
breath
painfully
drawn
moved
his
chest
she
saw
that
he
was
unconscious
from
the
stifling
oppression
under
which
he
had
been
buried
since
the
noon
an
hour
more
without
the
touch
of
fresher
air
and
life
would
have
been
extinct
cigarette
had
with
her
the
flask
of
brandy
that
she
always
brought
on
such
errands
as
these
she
forced
the
end
between
his
lips
and
poured
some
down
his
throat
her
hand
shook
slightly
as
she
did
so
a
weakness
the
gallant
little
campaigner
never
before
then
had
known
it
revived
him
in
a
degree
he
breathed
more
freely
though
heavily
and
with
difficulty
still
but
gradually
the
deadly
leaden
color
of
his
face
was
replaced
by
the
hue
of
life
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
more
loudly
consciousness
did
not
return
to
him
he
lay
motionless
and
senseless
with
his
head
resting
on
her
lap
and
with
in
eager
affection
licking
his
hands
and
his
hair
he
was
as
good
as
dead
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
and
me
said
cigarette
while
she
wetted
his
lips
with
more
brandy
ah
bah
and
he
would
be
more
grateful
for
a
scornful
scoff
from
milady
still
though
she
thought
this
she
let
his
head
lie
on
her
lap
and
as
she
looked
down
on
him
there
was
the
glisten
as
of
tears
in
the
brave
sunny
eyes
of
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
she
was
of
a
vivid
voluptuous
artistic
nature
she
was
thoroughly
in
her
passions
and
her
instincts
though
she
so
fiercely
contemned
womanhood
if
he
had
not
been
beautiful
she
would
never
have
looked
twice
at
him
never
once
have
pitied
his
fate
and
he
was
beautiful
still
though
his
hair
was
heavy
with
dew
and
dust
though
his
face
was
scorched
with
powder
though
his
eyes
were
closed
as
with
the
leaden
weight
of
death
and
his
beard
was
covered
with
the
red
stain
of
blood
that
had
flowed
from
the
on
his
shoulder
he
was
not
dead
he
was
not
even
in
peril
of
death
she
knew
enough
of
medical
lore
to
know
that
it
was
but
the
insensibility
of
exhaustion
and
suffocation
and
she
did
not
care
that
he
should
waken
she
dropped
her
head
over
him
moving
her
hand
softly
among
the
masses
of
his
curls
and
watching
the
quickening
beatings
of
his
heart
under
the
bare
strong
nerves
her
face
grew
tender
and
warm
and
eager
and
melting
with
a
marvelous
change
of
passionate
hues
she
had
all
the
ardor
of
southern
blood
without
a
wish
he
had
wakened
in
her
a
love
that
grew
daily
and
hourly
though
she
would
not
acknowledge
it
she
loved
to
see
him
lie
there
as
though
he
were
asleep
to
cheat
herself
into
the
fancy
that
she
watched
his
rest
to
wake
it
with
a
kiss
on
his
lips
in
that
unconsciousness
in
that
abandonment
he
seemed
wholly
her
own
passion
which
she
could
not
have
analyzed
made
her
bend
above
him
with
a
delight
in
that
solitary
possession
of
his
beauty
of
his
life
the
restless
movements
of
little
detached
a
piece
of
twine
passed
round
his
favorite
throat
the
glitter
of
gold
arrested
cigarette
eyes
she
caught
what
the
poodle
impatient
caress
had
broken
from
the
string
it
was
a
small
medallion
with
a
hole
through
it
by
which
it
had
been
slung
a
tiny
toy
once
costly
now
tarnished
for
it
had
been
carried
through
many
rough
scenes
and
many
years
of
hardship
had
been
bent
by
blows
struck
at
the
breast
against
which
it
rested
and
was
clotted
now
with
blood
inside
it
was
a
woman
ring
of
sapphires
and
opals
she
looked
at
both
close
in
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
then
passed
the
string
through
and
fastened
the
box
afresh
it
was
a
mere
trifle
but
it
sufficed
to
banish
her
dream
to
arouse
her
to
contemptuous
impatient
bitterness
with
that
new
weakness
that
had
for
the
hour
broken
her
down
to
the
level
of
this
feverish
folly
he
was
beautiful
yes
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
hate
him
she
could
not
help
the
brimming
tears
blinding
her
eyes
when
she
looked
at
him
stretched
senseless
thus
but
he
was
wedded
to
his
past
that
toy
in
his
breast
whatever
it
might
be
whatever
tale
might
cling
to
it
was
sweeter
to
him
than
her
lips
would
ever
be
bah
there
were
better
men
than
he
why
had
she
not
let
him
lie
and
die
as
he
might
under
the
pile
of
dead
bah
she
could
have
killed
herself
for
her
folly
she
who
had
scores
of
lovers
from
princes
to
and
never
had
a
heartache
for
one
of
them
to
go
and
care
for
a
silent
who
had
never
even
noticed
that
her
eyes
had
any
brightness
or
her
face
had
any
charm
you
deserve
to
be
shot
you
said
cigarette
fiercely
abusing
herself
as
she
put
his
head
off
her
lap
and
rose
abruptly
and
shouted
to
a
tringlo
who
was
at
some
distance
searching
for
the
wounded
here
is
a
with
some
breath
in
him
she
said
curtly
as
the
man
with
his
and
his
sad
burden
of
moaning
writhing
frames
drew
near
to
her
summons
put
him
in
soldiers
cost
too
much
training
to
waste
them
on
jackals
and
kites
if
one
can
help
it
lift
him
up
quick
he
is
badly
hurt
said
the
tringlo
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
no
i
have
had
worse
scratches
myself
the
horse
fell
on
him
that
was
the
mischief
i
never
saw
a
prettier
thing
every
lascar
has
killed
his
own
little
knot
of
arbicos
look
how
nice
and
neat
they
cigarette
glanced
over
the
field
with
the
satisfied
appreciation
of
a
dilettante
glancing
over
a
collection
unimpeachable
for
accuracy
and
arrangement
and
drank
a
toss
of
her
brandy
and
lighted
her
little
amber
pipe
and
sang
loudly
as
she
did
so
the
gayest
ballad
of
the
langue
verte
she
was
not
going
to
have
him
imagine
she
cared
for
that
chasseur
whom
he
lifted
up
on
his
little
wagon
with
so
kindly
a
care
not
she
cigarette
was
as
proud
in
her
way
as
was
ever
the
princesse
venetia
corona
nevertheless
she
kept
pace
with
the
mules
carrying
little
and
never
paused
on
her
way
though
she
passed
scores
of
dead
arabs
whose
silver
ornaments
and
silk
embroideries
commonly
replenished
the
knapsack
and
adorned
in
profusion
the
uniform
of
the
young
filibuster
being
gleaned
by
her
right
and
left
as
her
lawful
harvest
after
the
fray
leave
him
there
i
will
have
a
look
at
him
she
said
at
the
first
empty
tent
they
reached
the
camp
had
been
the
scene
of
as
fierce
a
struggle
as
the
part
of
the
plain
which
the
cavalry
had
held
and
it
was
strewn
with
the
slaughter
of
zouaves
and
tirailleurs
the
tringlo
obeyed
her
and
went
about
his
errand
of
mercy
cigarette
left
alone
with
the
wounded
man
lying
insensible
still
on
a
heap
of
forage
ceased
her
song
and
grew
very
quiet
she
had
a
certain
surgical
skill
learned
as
her
untutored
genius
learned
most
things
with
marvelous
rapidity
by
observation
and
intuition
and
she
had
saved
many
a
life
by
her
knowledge
and
her
patient
attendance
on
the
sufferers
patience
that
she
had
been
famed
for
when
she
had
been
only
six
years
old
and
a
surgeon
of
the
algerian
regiments
had
affirmed
that
he
could
trust
her
to
be
as
wakeful
as
watchful
and
as
sure
to
obey
his
directions
as
though
she
were
a
soeur
de
charite
now
the
little
fagot
of
opposites
as
cecil
had
called
her
put
this
skill
into
active
use
the
tent
had
been
a
scullion
tent
the
poor
marmiton
had
been
killed
and
lay
outside
with
his
head
clean
severed
by
an
arab
flissa
his
fire
had
gone
out
but
his
brass
pots
and
pans
his
jar
of
fresh
water
and
his
various
preparations
for
the
general
dinner
were
still
there
the
general
was
dead
also
far
yonder
where
he
had
fallen
in
the
van
of
his
zouaves
exposing
himself
with
all
the
splendid
reckless
gallantry
of
france
and
the
soup
stood
unserved
the
wild
plovers
were
taken
by
the
empty
dishes
waited
for
the
viands
which
there
were
no
hands
to
prepare
and
no
mouths
to
eat
cigarette
glanced
round
and
saw
all
with
one
flash
of
her
eyes
then
she
knelt
down
beside
the
heap
of
forage
and
for
the
first
thing
dressed
his
wounds
with
the
cold
clear
water
and
washed
away
the
dust
and
the
blood
that
covered
his
breast
he
is
too
good
a
soldier
to
die
one
must
do
it
for
france
she
said
to
herself
in
a
kind
of
and
as
she
did
it
and
bound
the
close
and
bathed
his
breast
his
forehead
his
hair
his
beard
free
from
the
sand
and
the
powder
and
the
gore
a
thousand
changes
swept
over
her
mobile
face
it
was
one
moment
soft
and
flushed
and
tender
as
passion
it
was
the
next
jealous
fiery
scornful
pale
and
full
of
impatient
he
was
nothing
to
her
morbleu
he
was
an
aristocrat
and
she
was
a
child
of
the
people
she
had
been
besieged
by
dukes
and
had
flouted
princes
she
had
borne
herself
in
such
gay
liberty
such
vivacious
freedom
such
proud
and
careless
sovereignty
bah
what
was
it
to
her
whether
this
man
lived
or
died
if
she
saved
him
he
would
give
her
a
low
bow
as
he
thanked
her
thinking
all
the
while
of
milady
and
yet
she
went
on
with
her
work
cecil
had
been
stunned
by
a
stroke
from
his
horse
hoof
as
the
poor
beast
fell
beneath
and
rolled
over
him
his
wounds
were
light
marvelously
so
for
the
thousand
strokes
that
had
been
aimed
at
him
but
it
was
difficult
to
arouse
him
from
unconsciousness
and
his
face
was
white
as
death
where
he
lay
on
the
heap
of
dry
reeds
and
grasses
she
began
to
feel
fear
of
that
lengthened
syncope
a
chill
tight
despairing
fear
that
she
had
never
known
in
her
life
before
she
knelt
silent
a
moment
drawing
through
her
hand
the
wet
locks
of
his
hair
with
the
bright
threads
of
gold
gleaming
in
it
then
she
started
up
and
leaving
him
found
a
match
and
lighted
the
wood
afresh
the
fire
soon
blazed
up
and
she
warmed
above
it
the
soup
that
had
grown
cold
poured
into
it
some
red
wine
that
was
near
and
forced
some
little
by
little
down
his
throat
it
was
with
difficulty
at
first
that
she
could
pass
any
though
his
tightly
locked
teeth
but
by
degrees
she
succeeded
and
only
still
he
drank
it
faster
the
heat
and
the
strength
reviving
him
as
its
stimulant
warmed
his
veins
his
eyes
did
not
unclose
but
he
stirred
moved
his
limbs
and
with
some
muttered
words
she
could
not
hear
drew
a
deeper
breath
and
turned
he
will
sleep
now
he
is
safe
she
thought
to
herself
while
she
stood
watching
him
with
a
curious
conflict
of
pity
impatience
anger
and
relief
at
war
within
her
bah
why
was
she
always
doing
good
services
to
this
man
who
only
cared
for
the
blue
serene
eyes
of
a
woman
who
would
never
give
him
aught
except
pain
why
should
she
take
such
care
to
keep
the
fire
of
vitality
alight
in
him
when
it
had
been
crushed
out
in
thousands
as
good
as
he
who
would
have
no
notice
save
a
hasty
thrust
into
the
earth
no
funeral
chant
except
the
screech
of
the
cigarette
had
been
too
successful
in
her
rebellion
against
all
weakness
and
was
far
too
fiery
a
young
warrior
to
find
refuge
or
consolation
in
the
poet
plea
how
is
it
under
our
control
to
love
or
not
to
love
to
allow
anything
to
gain
ascendancy
over
her
that
she
resisted
to
succumb
to
any
conqueror
that
was
unbidden
and
unwelcome
was
a
submission
beyond
words
degrading
to
the
fearless
of
the
friend
of
the
flag
and
yet
there
she
stayed
and
watched
him
she
took
some
food
for
she
had
been
fasting
all
day
then
she
dropped
down
before
the
fire
she
had
lighted
and
in
one
of
those
soft
curled
attitudes
that
were
characteristic
of
her
kept
her
vigil
over
him
she
was
bruised
stiff
tired
longing
like
a
tired
child
to
fall
asleep
her
eyes
felt
hot
as
flame
her
rounded
supple
limbs
were
aching
her
throat
was
sore
with
long
thirst
and
the
sand
that
she
seemed
to
have
swallowed
till
no
draught
of
water
or
wine
would
take
the
scorched
dry
pain
out
of
it
but
as
she
had
given
up
her
in
the
hospital
so
she
sat
now
as
patient
in
the
as
she
was
impatient
when
the
vivacious
agility
of
her
young
frame
was
longing
for
the
frenzied
delights
of
the
dance
or
the
battle
yonder
she
knew
where
her
spahis
bivouacked
on
the
field
there
were
riotous
homage
wild
applause
intoxicating
triumph
waiting
for
the
little
one
who
had
saved
the
day
if
she
chose
to
go
out
for
it
and
she
loved
to
be
the
center
of
such
adoration
and
rejoicing
with
all
the
exultant
vanity
of
a
child
and
a
hero
in
one
here
there
were
warmth
of
flames
quietness
of
rest
long
hours
for
slumber
all
that
her
burning
eyes
and
throbbing
nerves
were
longing
for
as
the
sleep
she
would
not
yield
to
stole
on
her
and
the
racking
pain
of
fatigue
cramped
her
bones
but
she
would
not
go
to
the
pleasure
without
and
she
would
not
give
way
to
the
weariness
that
tortured
her
cigarette
could
crucify
self
with
a
generous
courage
all
the
purer
because
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
there
was
anything
of
virtue
or
of
sacrifice
in
it
she
was
acting
en
bon
soldat
that
was
all
pouf
that
wanted
no
thanks
silence
settled
over
the
camp
half
the
slain
could
not
be
buried
and
the
clear
luminous
stars
rose
on
the
ghastly
plateau
all
that
were
heard
were
the
challenge
of
sentinels
the
tramp
of
patrols
the
guard
visited
her
once
she
kept
herself
awake
in
the
little
dark
tent
only
lit
by
the
glow
of
the
fire
dead
men
were
just
without
and
in
the
moonlight
without
as
the
night
came
on
she
could
see
the
severed
throat
of
the
scullion
and
the
head
further
off
like
a
round
gray
stone
but
that
was
nothing
to
cigarette
dead
men
were
no
more
to
her
than
dead
trees
are
to
others
every
now
and
then
four
or
five
times
in
an
hour
she
gave
him
whom
she
tended
the
soup
or
the
wine
that
she
kept
warmed
for
him
over
the
embers
he
took
it
without
knowledge
sunk
half
in
lethargy
half
in
sleep
but
it
kept
the
life
glowing
in
him
which
without
it
might
have
perished
of
cold
and
exhaustion
as
the
chills
and
northerly
wind
of
the
evening
succeeded
to
the
heat
of
the
day
and
pierced
through
the
canvas
walls
of
the
tent
it
was
very
bitter
more
keenly
felt
because
of
the
previous
burning
of
the
sun
there
was
no
cloak
or
covering
to
fling
over
him
she
took
off
her
blue
cloth
tunic
and
threw
it
across
his
chest
and
shivering
despite
herself
curled
closer
to
the
little
fire
she
did
not
know
why
she
did
it
he
was
nothing
to
her
and
yet
she
kept
herself
wide
awake
through
the
dark
autumn
night
lest
he
should
sigh
or
stir
and
she
not
hear
him
i
have
saved
his
life
twice
she
thought
looking
at
him
beware
of
the
third
time
they
say
he
moved
restlessly
and
she
went
to
him
his
face
was
flushed
now
his
breath
came
rapidly
and
shortly
there
was
some
fever
on
him
the
linen
was
displaced
from
his
wounds
she
dipped
it
again
in
water
and
laid
the
cooled
bands
on
them
ah
bah
if
i
were
not
unsexed
enough
for
this
how
would
it
be
with
you
now
she
said
in
her
teeth
he
tossed
wearily
to
and
fro
detached
words
caught
her
ear
as
he
muttered
them
let
it
be
let
it
be
he
is
welcome
how
could
i
prove
it
at
his
cost
i
saved
him
i
could
do
that
it
was
not
much
she
listened
with
intent
anxiety
to
hear
the
other
whispers
ending
the
sentence
but
they
were
stifled
and
broken
tiens
she
murmured
below
her
breath
it
is
for
some
other
he
has
ruined
she
could
not
catch
the
words
that
followed
they
were
in
an
unknown
language
to
her
for
she
knew
nothing
of
english
and
they
poured
fast
and
obscure
from
his
lips
as
he
moved
in
feverish
unrest
the
wine
that
had
saved
him
from
exhaustion
inflaming
his
brain
in
his
sleep
now
and
then
french
phrases
crossed
the
english
ones
she
leaned
down
to
seize
their
meaning
till
her
cheek
was
against
his
forehead
till
her
lips
touched
his
hair
and
at
that
half
caress
her
heart
beat
her
face
flushed
her
mouth
trembled
with
a
too
vivid
joy
with
an
impulse
half
fear
and
half
longing
that
had
never
so
moved
her
before
if
i
had
my
birthright
he
muttered
in
her
own
tongue
if
i
had
it
would
she
look
so
cold
then
she
might
love
me
women
used
once
o
god
if
she
had
not
looked
on
me
i
had
never
known
all
i
had
lost
cigarette
started
as
if
a
knife
had
stabbed
her
and
sprang
up
from
her
rest
beside
him
she
she
always
she
she
muttered
fiercely
while
her
face
grew
duskily
scarlet
in
the
of
the
tent
and
she
went
slowly
away
back
to
the
low
wood
fire
this
was
to
be
ever
her
reward
her
eyes
glistened
and
flashed
with
the
fiery
vengeful
passions
of
her
hot
and
jealous
instincts
cigarette
had
in
her
the
violence
as
she
had
the
nobility
of
a
grand
nature
that
has
gone
wholly
untutored
and
unguided
and
she
had
the
power
of
southern
vengeance
in
her
though
she
had
also
the
swift
temper
it
was
bitter
beyond
any
other
bitterness
that
could
have
wounded
her
for
the
spoilt
victorious
imperious
little
empress
of
the
army
of
algeria
to
feel
that
though
she
had
given
his
life
twice
back
to
the
man
she
was
less
to
him
than
the
tiny
white
dog
that
nestled
in
his
breast
that
she
who
never
before
had
endured
a
slight
or
known
what
neglect
could
mean
gave
care
and
pity
and
aid
and
even
tenderness
to
one
whose
only
thought
was
for
a
woman
who
had
accorded
him
nothing
but
a
few
chill
syllables
of
haughty
condescension
he
lay
there
unconscious
of
her
presence
tossing
wearily
to
and
fro
in
fevered
unrefreshing
sleep
murmuring
incoherent
words
of
french
and
english
strangely
mingled
and
cigarette
crouched
on
the
ground
with
the
firelight
playing
all
over
her
picturesque
childlike
beauty
and
her
large
eyes
strained
and
savage
yet
with
a
strange
wistful
pain
in
them
looking
out
at
the
moonlight
where
the
headless
body
lay
in
a
cold
gray
sea
of
shadow
yet
she
did
not
leave
him
she
was
too
generous
for
that
what
is
right
is
right
he
is
a
soldier
of
france
she
muttered
while
she
kept
her
vigil
she
felt
no
want
of
sleep
a
hard
hateful
wakefulness
seemed
to
have
banished
all
rest
from
her
she
stayed
there
all
the
night
so
with
the
touch
of
water
on
his
forehead
or
of
cooled
wine
to
his
lips
by
the
alteration
of
the
linen
on
his
wounds
or
the
shifting
of
the
rough
forage
that
made
his
bed
but
she
did
it
without
anything
of
that
loving
lingering
attendance
she
had
given
before
she
never
once
drew
out
the
task
longer
than
it
needed
or
let
her
hands
wander
among
his
hair
or
over
his
lips
as
she
had
done
before
and
he
never
once
was
conscious
of
it
he
never
once
knew
that
she
was
near
he
did
not
waken
from
the
painful
delirious
stupefied
slumber
that
had
fallen
on
him
he
only
vaguely
felt
that
he
was
suffering
pain
he
only
vaguely
dreamed
of
what
he
murmured
of
his
past
and
the
beauty
of
the
woman
who
had
brought
all
the
memories
of
that
past
back
on
him
and
this
was
cigarette
reward
to
hear
him
mutter
wearily
of
the
proud
eyes
and
of
the
lost
smile
of
another
the
dawn
came
at
last
her
constant
care
and
the
skill
with
which
she
had
cooled
and
dressed
his
wounds
had
done
him
infinite
service
the
fever
had
subsided
and
toward
morning
his
incoherent
words
ceased
his
breathing
grew
calmer
and
more
tranquil
he
fell
asleep
sleep
that
was
profound
dreamless
and
refreshing
she
looked
at
him
with
a
tempestuous
shadow
darkening
her
face
that
was
soft
with
a
tenderness
that
she
could
not
banish
she
hated
him
she
ought
to
have
stabbed
or
shot
him
rather
than
have
tended
him
thus
he
neglected
her
and
only
thought
of
that
woman
of
his
old
order
as
a
daughter
of
the
people
as
a
child
of
the
army
as
a
soldier
of
france
she
ought
to
have
killed
him
rather
than
have
caressed
his
hair
and
soothed
his
pain
pshaw
she
ground
one
in
another
her
tiny
white
teeth
that
were
like
a
spaniel
then
gently
very
gently
lest
she
should
waken
him
she
took
her
tunic
skirt
with
which
she
had
covered
him
from
the
chills
of
the
night
put
more
broken
wood
on
the
fading
fire
and
with
a
last
lingering
look
at
him
where
he
slept
passed
out
from
the
tent
as
the
sun
rose
in
a
flushed
and
beautiful
dawn
he
would
never
know
that
she
had
saved
him
thus
he
never
should
know
it
she
vowed
in
her
heart
cigarette
was
very
haughty
in
her
own
wayward
careless
fashion
at
a
word
of
love
from
him
at
a
kiss
from
his
lips
at
a
prayer
from
his
voice
she
would
have
given
herself
to
him
in
all
the
abandonment
of
a
first
passion
and
have
gloried
in
being
known
as
his
mistress
but
she
would
have
perished
by
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
have
sought
him
through
his
pity
or
through
his
gratitude
rather
than
have
accepted
the
compassion
of
a
heart
that
gave
its
warmth
to
another
rather
than
have
ever
let
him
learn
that
he
was
any
more
to
her
than
all
their
other
countless
comrades
who
filled
up
the
hosts
of
africa
he
will
never
know
she
said
to
herself
as
she
passed
through
the
disordered
camp
and
in
a
distant
quarter
coiled
herself
among
the
hay
of
a
and
covered
up
in
dry
grass
like
a
bird
in
a
nest
let
her
tired
limbs
lie
and
her
aching
eyes
close
in
repose
she
was
very
tired
and
every
now
and
then
as
she
slept
a
quick
sobbing
breath
shook
her
as
she
slumbered
like
a
fawn
who
has
been
wounded
while
it
played
chapter
xxviii
the
leathern
zackrist
with
the
reveille
and
the
break
of
morning
cigarette
woke
herself
again
she
gave
a
little
petulant
shake
to
her
fairy
form
when
she
thought
of
what
folly
she
had
been
guilty
ah
bah
you
deserve
to
be
shot
she
said
to
herself
afresh
one
would
think
you
were
a
silver
pheasant
you
grow
such
a
little
fool
love
was
all
very
well
so
cigarette
philosophy
had
always
reckoned
a
chocolate
bonbon
a
firework
a
bagatelle
a
draught
of
champagne
to
flavor
an
idle
moment
vin

she
had
always
been
accustomed
to
see
worshiped
together
as
became
their
alliterative
it
was
a
bit
of
fun
that
was
all
a
passion
that
had
pain
in
it
had
never
touched
the
little
one
she
had
disdained
it
with
the
lightest
airiest
contumely
if

a
bitter
almond
in
it
eat
the
sugar
and
throw
the
almond
away
you
goose
that
is
simple
enough
is
it
bah
i
do
pity
the
people
who
eat
the
bitter
almond
not
i
she
had
said
once
when
arguing
with
an
officer
on
the
absurdity
of
a
melancholy
love
that
possessed
him
and
whose
sadness
she
rallied
most
unmercifully
now
for
once
in
her
young
life
the
child
of
france
found
that
it
was
remotely
possible
to
meet
with
almonds
so
bitter
that
the
taste
will
remain
and
taint
all
things
do
what
philosophy
may
to
throw
its
acridity
aside
with
the
reveille
she
awoke
herself
again
though
she
had
not
had
more
than
an
hour
slumber
it
is
true
with
a
dull
ache
at
her
heart
that
was
very
new
and
bitterly
unwelcome
to
her
but
with
the
buoyant
vivacity
and
the
proud
carelessness
of
her
nature
in
arms
against
it
and
with
that
gayety
of
childhood
inherent
to
her
repelling
and
very
nearly
successfully
the
foreign
depression
that
weighted
on
it
her
first
thought
was
to
take
care
that
he
should
never
learn
what
she
had
done
for
him
the
princesse
corona
would
not
have
been
more
utterly
disdained
to
solicit
regard
through
making
a
claim
upon
gratitude
than
the
fiery
little
warrior
of
france
would
have
done
she
went
straight
to
the
tringlo
who
had
known
her
at
her
mission
of
mercy
georges
mon
brave
said
the
little
one
with
that
accent
of
authority
which
was
as
haughty
as
any
general
do
you
know
how
that
chasseur
is
that
we
brought
in
last
night
not
heard
ma
belle
said
the
cheery
little
tringlo
who
was
hard
pressed
for
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
he
was
very
busy
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
wounded
georges
lifted
his
eyebrows
ma
belle
there
are
very
few
there
are
hundreds
of
dead
the
few
there
are
we
shall
take
with
an
escort
of
spahis
to
good
i
will
go
with
you
have
a
heed
georges
never
to
whisper
that
i
had
anything
to
do
with
saving
that
man
i
called
to
you
and
why
my
little
one
because
i
desire
it
said
cigarette
with
her
most
imperious
emphasis
they
say
he
is
english
and
a
ruined
milord
pardieu
now
i
would
not
have
an
englishman
think
i
thought
his
six
feet
of
carcass
worth
saving
for
a
the
tringlo
chuckled
he
was
an
anglophobist
in
the
chinese
expedition
his
share
of
loot
had
been
robbed
from
him
by
a
trick
of
which
two
english
soldiers
had
been
the
concocters
and
a
vehement
animosity
against
the
whole
british
race
had
been
the
fruit
of
it
in
him
non
non
non
he
answered
her
heartily
i
understand
thou
art
very
bright
cigarette
if
we
have
ever
obliged
an
englishman
he
thinks
his
obligation
to
us
opens
him
a
neat
little
door
through
which
to
cheat
us
it
is
very
dangerous
to
oblige
the
english
they
always
hate
you
for
it
that
is
their
way
they
may
have
virtues
they
may
he
added
dubiously
but
with
an
impressive
air
of
strictest
impartiality
but
among
them
is
not
written
gratitude
ask
that
man
rac
how
they
treat
their
soldiers
and
georges
hurried
away
to
this
mules
and
his
duties
thinking
with
loving
regret
of
the
delicious
chinese
plunder
of
which
the
dogs
of
albion
had
deprived
him
he

safe
thought
cigarette
of
the
patrol
who
had
seen
her
she
was
not
afraid
he
had
never
noticed
with
whom
she
was
when
he
had
put
his
head
into
the
scullion
tent
and
she
made
her
way
toward
the
place
where
she
had
left
him
to
see
how
it
went
with
this
man
who
she
as
so
careful
should
never
know
that
which
he
had
owed
to
her
it
went
well
with
him
thanks
to
her
care
and
strengthening
nourishment
and
the
skill
of
her
tendance
had
warded
off
all
danger
from
his
wound
the
bruise
and
pressure
from
the
weight
of
the
horse
had
been
more
ominous
and
he
could
not
raise
himself
or
even
breathe
without
severe
pain
but
his
fever
had
left
him
and
he
had
just
been
lifted
into
a
as
cigarette
reached
the
spot
how
goes
the
day
victor
so
you
got
sharp
scratches
i
hear
ah
that
was
a
splendid
thing
we
had
yesterday
when
did
you
go
down
we
charged
together
she
cried
gayly
to
him
then
her
voice
dropped
suddenly
with
an
indescribable
sweetness
and
change
of
tone
so
you
suffer
still
she
asked
softly
coming
close
up
to
where
he
lay
on
the
straw
she
saw
the
exhausted
languor
of
his
regard
the
heavy
darkness
under
his
eyelids
the
effort
with
which
his
lips
moved
as
the
faint
words
came
broken
through
them
not
very
much
ma
belle
i
thank
you
i
shall
be
fit
for
harness
in
a
day
or
two
do
not
let
them
send
me
into
hospital
i
shall
be
perfectly
well
cigarette
swayed
herself
upon
the
wheel
and
leaned
toward
him
touching
and
changing
his
bandages
with
clever
hands
they
have
dressed
your
wound
ill
whose
doing
is
that
it
is
nothing
i
have
been
half
cut
to
pieces
before
now
this
is
a
mere
bagatelle
it
is
only
that
it
hurts
you
to
breathe
i
know
have
they
given
you
anything
to
eat
this
morning
no
everything
is
in
confusion
we
she
did
not
stay
for
the
conclusion
of
his
sentence
she
had
darted
off
quick
as
a
swallow
she
knew
what
she
had
left
in
her
dead
tent
everything
was
in
confusion
as
he
had
said
of
the
few
hundreds
that
had
been
left
after
the
terrific
onslaught
of
the
past
day
some
were
employed
far
out
thrusting
their
own
dead
into
the
soil
others
were
removing
the
tents
and
all
the
equipage
of
the
camp
others
were
busied
with
the
wounded
of
whom
the
greatest
sufferers
were
to
be
borne
to
the
nearest
hospital
that
nearest
many
leagues
away
over
the
wild
and
barren
country
while
those
who
were
likely
to
be
again
soon
ready
for
service
were
to
be
escorted
to
the
headquarters
of
the
main
army
among
the
latter
cecil
had
passionately
entreated
to
be
numbered
his
prayer
was
granted
to
the
man
who
had
kept
at
the
head
of
his
chasseurs
and
borne
aloft
the
tricolor
through
the
whole
of
the
on
which
the
dawn
had
risen
and
which
had
barely
lulled
and
sunk
by
the
setting
of
the
sun
chateauroy
was
away
with
the
other
five
of
his
squadrons
and
the
zouave
the
only
officer
of
any
rank
who
had
come
alive
through
the
conflict
had
himself
visited
bertie
and
given
him
warm
words
of
eulogy
and
even
of
gratitude
that
had
soldierly
sincerity
and
cordiality
in
them
your
conduct
was
magnificent
he
had
said
as
he
had
turned
away
it
shall
be
my
care
that
it
is
duly
reported
and
cigarette
was
but
a
few
seconds
absent
she
soon
bounded
back
like
the
swift
little
chamois
she
was
bringing
with
her
a
huge
bowlful
of
red
wine
with
bread
broken
in
it
this
is
the
best
i
could
get
she
said
it
is
better
than
nothing
it
will
strengthen
what
have
you
had
yourself
petite
ah
bah
leave
off
thinking
for
others
i
have
breakfasted
long
ago
she
answered
him
she
had
only
eaten
a
biscuit
as
hard
as
a
flint
take
it
here
i
will
hold
it
for
she
perched
herself
on
the
wheel
like
a
bird
on
a
twig
she
had
a
power
of
alighting
and
sustaining
herself
on
the
most
difficult
and
most
airy
elevation
but
cecil
turned
his
eyes
on
the
only
soldier
in
the
cart
besides
himself
one
of
the
worst
men
in
his
regiment
a
murderous
sullen
evil
wretch
fitter
for
the
bench
of
the
than
for
the
ranks
of
the
cavalry
give
half
to
zackrist
he
said
i
know
no
hunger
and
he
has
more
need
of
zackrist
that
is
the
man
who
stole
your
lance
and
accouterments
and
got
you
into
trouble
by
taking
them
to
pawn
in
your
name
a
year
or
more
well
what
of
that
he
is
not
the
less
what
of
that
why
you
were
going
to
be
turned
into
the
first
battalion
disgraced
for
the
affair
because
you
would
not
tell
of
him
if
vireflau
had
not
found
out
the
right
of
the
matter
in
time
the
battalion
of
the
criminal
outcasts
of
all
corps
whether
horse
or
foot
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
this
victor
that
you
are
a
i
dare
say
i
am
but
that
does
not
make
zackrist
less
he
took
the
bowl
from
her
hands
and
emptying
a
little
of
it
into
the
wooden
bidon
that
hung
to
her
belt
kept
that
for
himself
and
stretching
his
arm
across
the
straw
gave
the
bowl
to
zackrist
who
had
watched
it
with
the
longing
ravenous
eyes
of
a
starving
wolf
and
seized
it
with
rabid
avidity
a
smile
passed
over
cecil
face
amused
despite
the
pain
he
suffered
that
is
one
of
my
tricks
as
de
chateauroy
calls
them
poor
zackrist
did
you
see
his
eyes
a
jackal
eyes
yes
said
cigarette
who
between
her
admiration
for
the
action
and
her
impatience
at
the
waste
of
her
good
bread
and
wine
hardly
knew
whether
to
applaud
or
to
deride
him
what
recompense
do
you
think
you
will
get
he
will
steal
your
things
again
first
may
be
i
do
think
he
will
but
he
is
very
hungry
all
the
same
that
is
about
the
only
question
just
now
he
answered
her
as
he
drank
and
ate
his
portion
with
a
need
of
it
that
could
willingly
have
made
him
take
thrice
as
much
though
for
the
sake
of
zackrist
he
had
denied
his
want
of
it
zackrist
himself
who
could
hear
perfectly
what
was
said
uttered
no
word
but
when
he
had
finished
the
contents
of
the
bowl
lay
looking
at
his
corporal
with
an
odd
gleam
in
the
dark
sullen
savage
depths
of
his
hollow
eyes
he
was
not
going
to
say
a
word
of
thanks
no
none
had
ever
heard
a
grateful
or
a
decent
word
from
him
in
his
life
he
was
proud
of
that
he
was
the
most
brute
in
the
army
and
like
snake
in
the
school
for
scandal
thought
a
good
action
would
have
ruined
his
character
forever
nevertheless
there
came
into
his
cunning
and
ferocious
eyes
a
glisten
of
the
same
light
which
had
been
in
the
little
gamin
when
first
by
the
bivouac
fire
he
had
murmured
picpon
when
anybody
stole
from
me
muttered
cigarette
i
shot
you
would
have
fed
him
had
he
been
starving
do
not
belie
yourself
cigarette
you
are
too
generous
ever
to
be
pooh
revenge
is
one
i
doubt
that
we
are
none
of
us
good
enough
to
claim
it
at
any
cigarette
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
silence
then
posing
herself
on
the
wheel
she
sprang
from
thence
on
to
the
back
of
her
little
mare
which
she
had
brought
up
having
the
reins
in
one
of
her
hands
and
the
in
the
other
and
was
fresh
and
bright
after
the
repose
i
will
ride
with
you
with
my
spahis
she
said
as
a
young
queen
might
have
promised
protection
for
her
escort
he
thanked
her
and
sank
back
among
the
straw
exhausted
and
worn
out
with
pain
and
with
languor
the
weight
that
seemed
to
oppress
his
chest
was
almost
as
hard
to
bear
as
when
the
actual
pressure
of
his
dead
charger
body
had
been
on
him
yet
as
he
had
said
it
was
but
a
bagatelle
beside
the
all
but
mortal
wounds
the
agonizing
neuralgia
the
prostrating
fever
the
torture
of
nerves
and
the
scorching
fire
of
inflamed
that
had
in
their
turn
been
borne
by
him
in
his
twelve
years
of
african
service
things
which
to
men
who
have
never
suffered
them
sound
like
the
romanced
horrors
of
an
exaggerated
imagination
yet
things
which
are
daily
and
quietly
borne
by
such
soldiers
of
the
algerian
army
as
the
natural
accompaniments
of
a
military
life
borne
too
in
brave
simple
unconscious
heroism
by
men
who
know
well
that
the
only
reward
for
it
will
be
their
own
at
having
been
true
to
the
traditions
of
their
regiment
four
other
troopers
were
placed
on
the
straw
beside
him
and
the
with
their
mournful
loads
rolled
slowly
out
of
camp
eastward
toward
the
quarters
of
the
main
army
the
spahis
glowing
red
against
the
sun
escorting
them
with
their
darling
in
their
midst
while
from
their
deep
chests
they
shouted
war
songs
in
sabir
with
all
the
wild
and
riotous
delight
that
the
triumph
of
victory
and
the
glow
of
bloodshed
roused
in
those
who
combined
in
them
the
fire
of
france
and
the
fanaticism
of
islamism
an
irresistible
union
though
the
nights
were
now
cold
and
before
long
even
the
advent
of
snow
might
be
looked
for
the
days
were
hot
and
even
scorching
still
cigarette
and
her
spahis
took
no
heed
of
it
they
were
desert
born
and
bred
and
she
was
invulnerable
to
heat
as
any
little
salamander
but
although
they
were
screened
as
well
as
they
could
be
under
an
improvised
awning
the
wounded
men
suffered
terribly
gnats
and
mosquitoes
and
all
the
winged
things
of
the
african
air
tormented
them
and
tossing
on
the
dry
hot
straw
they
grew
delirious
some
falling
asleep
and
murmuring
incoherently
others
lying
with
eyes
of
straining
misery
cigarette
had
known
well
how
it
would
be
with
them
she
had
accompanied
such
escorts
many
a
time
and
ever
and
again
when
they
halted
she
dismounted
and
came
to
them
and
mixed
wine
with
some
water
that
she
had
slung
a
barrel
of
to
her
saddle
and
gave
it
to
them
and
moved
their
bandages
and
spoke
to
them
with
a
soft
caressing
consolation
that
pacified
them
as
if
by
some
magic
she
had
led
them
like
a
young
lion
on
to
the
slaughter
in
the
past
day
she
soothed
them
now
with
a
gentleness
that
the
gentlest
daughter
of
the
church
could
not
have
surpassed
the
way
was
long
the
road
ill
formed
leading
for
the
most
part
across
a
sear
and
desolate
country
with
nothing
to
relieve
its
barrenness
except
long
stretches
of
the
great
reeds
at
noon
the
heat
was
intense
the
little
cavalcade
halted
for
half
an
hour
under
the
shade
of
some
black
towering
rocks
which
broke
the
monotony
of
the
district
and
commenced
a
more
hilly
and
more
picturesque
portion
of
the
country
cigarette
came
to
the
side
of
the
temporary
ambulance
in
which
cecil
was
placed
he
was
asleep
sleeping
for
once
peacefully
with
little
trace
of
pain
upon
his
features
as
he
had
slept
the
previous
night
she
saw
that
his
face
and
chest
had
not
been
touched
by
the
stinging
he
was
doubly
screened
by
a
shirt
hung
above
him
dexterously
on
some
bent
sticks
who
has
done
that
thought
cigarette
as
she
glanced
round
she
saw
without
any
linen
to
cover
him
zackrist
had
reared
himself
up
and
leaned
slightly
forward
over
against
his
comrade
the
shirt
that
protected
cecil
was
his
and
on
his
own
bare
shoulders
and
mighty
chest
the
tiny
armies
of
the
flies
and
gnats
were
fastened
doing
their
will
uninterrupted
as
he
caught
her
glance
a
sullen
ruddy
glow
of
shame
shown
through
the
black
hard
skin
of
his
visage
shame
to
which
he
had
been
never
touched
when
discovered
in
any
one
of
his
guilty
and
barbarous
actions
dame
he
growled
savagely
he
gave
me
his
wine
one
must
do
something
in
return
not
that
i
feel
the
insects
not
i
my
skin
is
leather
see
you
they
ca
get
through
it
but
his
is
white
and
soft
bah
like
i
see
zackrist
you
are
right
a
french
soldier
can
never
take
a
kindness
from
an
english
fellow
without
outrunning
him
in
generosity
look
here
is
some
drink
for
she
knew
too
well
the
strange
nature
with
which
she
had
to
deal
to
say
a
syllable
of
praise
to
him
for
his
or
to
appear
to
see
that
despite
his
boast
of
his
leather
skin
the
stings
of
the
cruel
winged
tribes
were
drawing
his
blood
and
causing
him
alike
pain
and
irritation
which
under
that
sun
and
added
to
the
torment
of
his
were
a
martyrdom
as
great
as
the
noblest
saint
ever
endured
tiens
tiens
i
did
him
wrong
murmured
cigarette
that
is
what
they
are
the
children
of
france
even
when
they
are
at
their
worst
like
that
devil
zackrist
who
dare
say
they
are
not
the
heroes
of
the
world
and
all
through
the
march
she
gave
zackrist
a
double
portion
of
her
water
dashed
with
red
wine
that
was
so
welcome
and
so
precious
to
the
parched
and
aching
throats
and
all
through
the
march
cecil
lay
asleep
and
the
man
who
had
thieved
from
him
the
man
whose
soul
was
stained
with
murder
and
pillage
and
rapine
sat
erect
beside
him
letting
the
insects
suck
his
veins
and
pierce
his
flesh
it
was
only
when
they
drew
near
the
camp
of
the
main
army
that
zackrist
beat
off
the
swarm
and
drew
his
old
shirt
over
his
head
you
do
not
want
to
say
anything
to
him
he
muttered
to
cigarette
i
am
of
leather
you
know
i
have
not
felt
she
nodded
she
understood
him
yet
his
shoulders
and
his
chest
were
flayed
despite
the
tough
and
horny
skin
of
which
he
made
his
boast
dieu
we
are
droll
mused
cigarette
if
we
do
a
good
thing
we
hide
it
as
if
it
were
a
bit
of
stolen
meat
we
are
so
afraid
it
should
be
found
out
but
if
they
do
one
in
the
world
there
they
bray
it
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
from
the
houses
roofs
and
run
all
down
the
streets
screaming
about
it
for
fear
it
should
be
lost
dieu
we
are
droll
and
she
dashed
the
spurs
into
her
mare
and
galloped
off
at
the
height
of
her
speed
into
camp
a
very
city
of
canvas
buzzing
with
the
hum
of
life
regulated
with
the
marvelous
skill
and
precision
of
french
warfare
yet
with
the
carelessness
and
the
picturesqueness
of
the
pervading
it
la
cigarette
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
as
the
bay
mare
with
her
little
amazon
rider
followed
by
the
scarlet
cloud
of
the
spahis
all
ablaze
like
poppies
in
the
sun
rose
in
sight
thrown
out
against
the
azure
of
the
skies
what
she
had
done
had
been
told
long
before
by
an
orderly
riding
hard
in
the
early
night
to
take
the
news
of
the
battle
and
the
whole
host
was
on
watch
for
its
darling
the
savior
of
the
honor
of
france
like
wave
rushing
on
wave
of
some
tempestuous
ocean
the
men
swept
out
to
meet
her
in
one
great
surging
tide
of
life
impetuous
passionate
idolatrous
exultant
with
all
the
vivid
ardor
all
the
uncontrolled
emotion
of
natures
they
broke
away
from
their
midday
rest
as
from
their
military
toil
moved
as
by
one
swift
breath
of
fire
and
flung
themselves
out
to
meet
her
the
chorus
of
a
thousand
voices
ringing
in
deafening
vivas
to
the
skies
she
was
enveloped
in
that
vast
sea
of
eager
furious
lives
in
that
dizzy
tumult
of
vociferous
cries
and
stretching
hands
and
upturned
faces
as
her
soldiers
had
done
the
night
before
so
these
did
now
kissing
her
hands
her
dress
her
feet
sending
her
name
in
thunder
through
the
sunlit
air
lifting
her
from
off
her
horse
and
bearing
her
in
a
score
of
stalwart
arms
triumphant
in
their
midst
she
was
theirs
their
own
the
child
of
the
army
the
little
one
whose
voice
above
their
dying
brethren
had
the
sweetness
of
an
angel
song
and
whose
feet
in
their
hours
of
revelry
flew
like
the
swift
and
dazzling
flight
of
orioles
and
she
had
saved
the
honor
of
their
eagles
she
had
given
to
them
and
to
france
their
god
of
victory
they
loved
her
o
god
how
they
loved
her
with
that
intense
breathless
intoxicating
love
of
a
multitude
which
though
it
may
stone
what
it
adores
has
yet
for
those
on
whom
it
has
once
been
given
thus
a
power
no
other
love
can
know
a
passion
unutterably
sad
deliriously
strong
that
passion
moved
her
strangely
as
she
looked
down
upon
them
she
knew
that
not
one
man
breathed
among
that
tumultuous
mass
but
would
have
died
that
moment
at
her
word
not
one
mouth
moved
among
that
countless
host
but
breathed
her
name
in
pride
and
love
and
honor
she
might
be
a
careless
young
coquette
a
lawless
little
brigand
a
child
of
sunny
caprices
an
elf
of
dauntless
mischief
but
she
was
more
than
these
the
divine
fire
of
genius
had
touched
her
and
cigarette
would
have
perished
for
her
country
not
less
surely
than
jeanne
the
holiness
of
an
impersonal
love
the
glow
of
an
imperishable
patriotism
the
melancholy
of
a
passionate
pity
for
the
concrete
and
unnumbered
sufferings
of
the
people
were
in
her
instinctive
and
inborn
as
fragrance
in
the
heart
of
flowers
and
all
these
together
moved
her
now
and
made
her
young
face
beautiful
as
she
looked
down
upon
the
crowding
soldiery
it
was
nothing
she
answered
them
it
was
nothing
it
was
for
for
france
they
shouted
back
the
beloved
word
with
tenfold
joy
and
the
great
sea
of
life
beneath
her
tossed
to
and
fro
in
stormy
triumph
in
frantic
paradise
of
victory
ringing
her
name
with
that
of
france
upon
the
air
in
like
spears
of
steel
smiting
on
shields
of
bronze
but
she
stretched
her
hand
out
and
swept
it
backward
to
the
of
the
south
with
a
gesture
that
had
awe
for
them
hush
she
said
softly
with
an
accent
in
her
voice
that
hushed
the
riot
of
their
rejoicing
homage
till
it
lulled
like
the
lull
in
a
storm
give
me
no
honor
while
they
sleep
yonder
with
the
dead
lies

cigarette
interrupting
herself
in
her
chant
in
honor
of
the
attributes
of
war
as
the
tringlo
mules
which
she
was
driving
some
three
weeks
after
the
fray
of
zaraila
stopped
by
sheer
force
of
old
habit
in
the
middle
of
a
green
plateau
on
the
outskirts
of
a
camp
pitched
in
its
center
and
overlooked
by
brown
rugged
scarps
of
rock
with
stunted
bushes
on
their
summits
and
here
and
there
a
maritime
pine
clinging
to
their
naked
slopes
at
sight
of
the
little
beasts
and
the
form
behind
them
the
tirailleurs
indigenes
and
the
zouaves
on
whose
side
of
the
encampment
she
had
approached
rushed
toward
her
with
frantic
shouts
and
wild
delight
and
vehement
hurrahs
in
a
tempest
of
vociferous
welcome
that
might
have
stunned
any
ears
less
used
and
startled
any
nerves
less
steeled
to
military
life
than
the
friend
of
the
flag
she
signed
back
the
shouting
disorderly
crowd
with
her
as
superbly
as
though
she
were
a
marshal
of
france
signing
back
a
whole
army

what
children
you
are
you

and
scramble
and

you
shall
none
of
you
have
so
much
as
a
morsel
of
black
bread
do
you
hear
it
was
amusing
to
see
how
they
minded
her
contemptuous
orders
how
these
the
terror
of
the
country
each
one
of
whom
could
have
crushed
her
in
his
grasp
as
a
wolf
crushes
a
lamb
slunk
back
silenced
and
obedient
before
the
imperious
bidding
of
the
little
vivandiere
they
had
heeded
her
and
let
her
rule
over
them
almost
as
much
when
she
had
been
seven
years
old
and
her
curls
now
so
dark
had
been
yellow

if
you

a

might
be

the
humiliated
supplication
of
the
reply
appeased
their
autocratic
sovereign
she
nodded
her
head
in
assent
i
know
i
know
i
have
gone
days
on
a
handful
of
le

his

his
fine

where
he
camps

but
we
soldiers
have
nothing
but
a
hunch
of
baked
chaff
well
we
win
battles
on
it
which
was
one
of
the
impromptu
proverbs
that
cigarette
was
wont
to
manufacture
and
bring
into
her
discourse
with
an
air
of
authority
as
of
one
who
quotes
from
profound
scholastic
lore
it
was
received
with
a
howl
of
applause
and
of
ratification
the
entrails
often
gnaw
with
bitter
pangs
of
famine
in
the
army
of
algiers
and
they
knew
well
how
sharp
an
edge
hunger
gives
to
the
steel
nevertheless
the
sullen
angry
roar
of
famished
men
that
is
so
closely
so
terribly
like
the
roar
of
wild
beasts
did
not
cease
where
is
biribi
they
growled
biribi
never
keeps
us
waiting
those
are
biribi
right
said
cigarette
laconically
with
a
crack
of
her
on
to
the
arm
of
a
zouave
who
was
attempting
to
make
free
with
her
convoy
and
purloin
a
loaf
off
the
load
where
is
biribi
then
they
roared
in
concert
a
crowd
of
eager
wolfish
ravenous
impatient
men
hungry
as
camp
fasting
could
make
them
and
half
inclined
even
to
tear
their
darling
in
pieces
since
she
kept
them
thus
from
the
stores
cigarette
uncovered
her
head
with
a
certain
serious
grace
very
rare
in
her
biribi
had
made
a
good
her
assailants
grew
very
quiet
shot
they
asked
briefly
biribi
was
a
tringlo
well
beloved
in
all
the
battalions
cigarette
nodded
with
a
gesture
outward
to
the
solitary
country
she
was
accustomed
to
these
incidents
of
war
she
thought
of
them
no
more
than
a
girl
of
civilized
life
thinks
of
the
grouse
or
the
partridges
that
are
killed
by
her
lovers
and
brothers
i
was
out
yonder
two
leagues
or
more
away
i
was
riding
i
was
on
my
own
horse
well
i
heard
shots
of
course
i
made
for
the
place
by
my
ear
before
i
got
up
i
saw
what
was
the
mischief
there
were
the
mules
in
a
gorge
and
biribi
in
front
of
them
fighting
mon
dieu
fighting
like
the
devil
with
three
arbis
on
him
they
were
trying
to
stop
the
convoys
and
biribi
was
beating
them
back
with
all
his
might
i
was
too
far
off
to
do
much
good
but
i
shouted
and
dashed
down
to
them
the
arbis
heard
biribi
heard
he
flew
on
to
them
like
a
tiger
that
little
tringlo
it
was
wonderful
two
fell
dead
under
him
the
third
took
fright
and
fled
when
i
got
up
biribi
lay
above
the
dead
brutes
with
a
dozen
wounds
in
him
if
there
were
one
he
looked
up
and
knew
me
it
thee
cigarette
he
asked
and
he
could
hardly
speak
for
the
blood
in
his
throat
not
wait
with
me
i
am
dead
already
drive
the
mules
into
camp
as
quick
as
thou
canst
the
men
will
be
thinking
me
late
biribi
was
always
bon
enfant
muttered
the
listening
throng
they
forgot
their
hunger
as
they
heard
ah
he
thought
more
of
you
than
you
deserve
you
jackals
i
drew
him
aside
into
a
hole
in
the
rocks
out
of
the
heat
he
was
dead
he
was
right
no
man
could
live
slashed
about
like
that
the
arbicos
had
set
on
him
as
he
went
singing
along
if
he
would
have
given
up
the
brutes
and
the
stores
they
would
not
have
harmed
him
but
that
was
not
biribi
i
did
all
i
could
for
him
dame
it
was
no
good
he
lay
very
still
for
some
minutes
with
his
head
on
my
lap
then
he
moved
restlessly
and
tossed
about
will
think
me
so
late
so
late
he
muttered
they
are
famished
by
this
there
is
that
letter
too
from
his
mother
for
there
is
all
that
news
from
france
i
have
so
much
for
them
and
i
shall
be
so
late
so
late
all
he
thought
was
that
he
should
be
so
late
into
camp
well
it
was
all
over
very
soon
i
do
not
think
he
suffered
but
he
was
so
afraid
you
should
not
have
the
food
i
left
him
in
the
cave
and
drove
the
mules
on
as
he
asked
had
galloped
away
have
you
seen
him
home
there
broke
once
more
from
the
hearkening
throng
a
roar
that
shook
the
echoes
from
the
rocks
but
it
was
not
now
the
rage
of
famished
longing
but
the
rage
of
the
lust
for
vengeance
and
the
grief
of
passionate
hearts
blent
together
quick
as
the
lightning
flashes
their
swords
leaped
from
their
scabbards
and
shook
in
the
air
we
will
avenge
him
they
shouted
as
with
one
throat
the
hoarse
cry
rolling
down
the
valley
like
a
swell
of
thunder
if
the
bonds
of
discipline
had
loosed
them
they
would
have
rushed
forth
on
the
search
and
to
the
slaughter
forgetful
of
hunger
of
heat
of
of
of
all
things
save
the
dead
tringlo
whose
only
fear
in
death
had
been
lest
they
should
want
and
suffer
through
him
their
adjutants
alarmed
by
the
tumult
hurried
to
the
spot
fearing
a
bread
riot
for
the
camp
was
far
from
supplies
and
had
been
ill
victualed
for
several
days
they
asked
rapidly
what
was
the
matter
biribi
had
been
killed
some
soldier
answered
ah
and
the
bread
not
yes
mon
adjutant
the
bread
is
there
and
cigarette
there
is
no
need
for
me
then
muttered
the
adjutant
of
zouaves
the
little
one
will
keep
the
little
one
had
before
now
quelled
a
mutiny
with
her
pistol
at
the
ringleader
forehead
and
her
brave
scornful
words
scourging
the
insubordinates
for
their
dishonor
to
their
arms
for
their
treason
to
the
tricolor
and
she
was
equal
to
the
occasion
now
she
lifted
her
right
hand
we
will
avenge
him
that
is
of
course
the
flag
of
france
never
hangs
idly
when
there
is
a
brave
life
loss
to
be
reckoned
for
i
shall
know
again
the
cur
that
fled
trust
to
me
and
now
be
silent
you
bawl
out
your
oath
of
vengeance
oh
yes
but
you
bawled
as
loud
a
minute
ago
for
bread
biribi
loved
you
better
than
you
deserved
you
deserve
nothing
you
are
hounds
ready
to
tear
for
offal
to
eat
as
to
rend
the
foe
of
your
dead
friend
bah
the
roar
of
the
voices
sank
somewhat
cigarette
had
sprung
aloft
on
a
and
as
the
sun
shone
on
her
face
it
was
brilliant
with
the
scorn
that
lashed
them
like
whips
sang
de
dieu
fiercely
swore
a
zouave
hounds
indeed
if
it
were
anyone
but
you
when
one
has
had
nothing
but
a
snatch
of
raw
meat
and
a
taste
of
coffee
black
with
mud
for
a
week
through
is
one
a
hound
because
one
hungers
no
said
the
orator
from
her
elevation
and
her
eyes
softened
wonderfully
in
her
heart
she
loved
them
so
well
these
wild
barbaric
warriors
that
she
censured
no
one
is
not
a
hound
because
one
hungers
but
one
is
not
a
soldier
if
one
complains
well
biribi
loved
you
and
i
am

your

your

your
commissions
biribi
forgot
nothing
as
if
you
deserved
to
be
worked
for
or
thought
of
with
which
reproach
cigarette
relieved
herself
of
the
certain
pain
that
was
left
on
her
by
the
death
of
biribi
she
always
found
that
to
work
yourself
into
a
passion
with
somebody
is
the
very
best
way
in
the
world
to
banish
an
unwelcome
emotion
the
men
summoned
by
their
which
were
so
familiar
that
they
had
many
of
them
fairly
forgotten
their
original
names
rallied
around
her
to
receive
the
various
packets
with
which
a
tringlo
is
commonly
charged
by
friends
in
the
towns
or
relatives
away
in
france
for
the
soldiers
of
african
brigades
and
which
as
well
as
his
convoy
of
food
and
his
budget
of
news
render
him
so
precious
and
so
welcome
an
arrival
at
an
encampment
the
dead
biribi
had
been
one
of
the
lightest
brightest
cheeriest
and
sauciest
of
the
gay
kindly
industrious
wanderers
of
his
branch
of
the
service
always
willing
to
lead
always
ready
to
help
always
smoking
singing
laughing
chattering
treating
his
three
mules
as
an
indulgent
mother
her
children
calling
them
plick
plack
et
plock
and
thinking
of
plick
plack
et
plock
far
beyond
himself
at
all
times
a
merry
busy
smiling
soul
who
was
always
happy
trudging
along
the
sunburned
road
and
caroling
in
his
joyous
voice
chansonnettes
and
gaudrioles
to
the
african
flocks
and
herds
amid
the
african
solitudes
if
there
were
a
man
they
loved
it
was
biribi
biribi
whose
advent
in
camp
had
always
been
the
signal
for
such
laughter
such
abundance
such
showers
of
newspapers
such
quantities
of
intelligence
from
that
france
for
tidings
of
which
the
veteran
among
them
would
ask
with
a
pang
at
the
heart
with
a
thrill
in
the
words
and
they
had
sworn
and
would
keep
what
they
had
sworn
in
bitter
intensity
to
avenge
him
to
the
uttermost
point
of
vengeance
yet
five
minutes
afterward
when
the
provisions
plick
plack
et
plock
had
brought
were
divided
and
given
out
they
were
shouting
eating
singing
devouring
with
as
eager
a
zest
and
as
hearty
an
enjoyment
as
though
biribi
were
among
them
and
did
not
lie
dead
two
leagues
away
with
a
dozen
wounds
slashed
on
his
stiffening
frame
what
heartless
brutes
are
they
always
like
that
muttered
a
gentleman
painter
who
traveling
through
the
interior
to
get
military
sketches
had
obtained
permission
to
take
up
quarters
in
the
camp
if
they
were
not
like
that
they
could
not
live
a
day
a
voice
answered
curtly
behind
him
do
you
know
what
this
service
is
that
you
venture
to
judge
them
men
who
meet
death
in
the
face
every
five
minutes
they
breathe
can
not
afford
the
space
for
sentimentalism
which
those
who
saunter
at
ease
and
in
safety
can
do
they
laugh
when
we
are
dead
perhaps
but
they
are
true
as
steel
to
us
while
we
live
it
is
the
reverse
of
the
practice
of
the
world
the
tourist
started
turned
and
looked
aghast
at
the
man
who
had
reproved
him
it
was
a
chasseur
who
having
spoken
was
already
some
way
onward
moving
through
the
press
and
tumult
of
the
camp
to
his
own
regiment
portion
of
it
cigarette
standing
by
to
see
that
plick
plack
and
plock
were
property
baited
on
the
greenest
forage
to
be
found
heard
and
her
eyes
flashed
with
a
deep
delight
dame
she
thought
i
could
not
have
answered
better
myself
he
is
a
true
soldier
and
she
forgave
cecil
all
his
sins
to
her
with
the
quick
impetuous
generous
pardon
of
her
warm
little
gallic
heart
cigarette
believed
that
she
could
hate
very
bitterly
indeed
her
power
of
resentment
she
rated
high
among
her
grandest
qualities
had
the
little
leopard
been
told
that
she
could
not
resent
to
the
death
what
offended
her
she
would
have
held
herself
most
infamously
insulted
yet
hate
was
in
truth
foreign
to
her
frank
vivacious
nature
its
deadliness
never
belonged
to
her
if
its
passion
might
and
at
a
trait
akin
to
her
at
a
flash
of
sympathetic
spirit
in
the
object
of
her
displeasure
cigarette
changed
from
wrath
to
friendship
with
the
true
instinct
of
her
little
heart
of
gold
a
heart
which
though
it
had
been
tossed
about
on
a
sea
of
blood
and
had
never
been
graven
with
so
much
as
one
tender
word
or
one
moral
principle
from
the
teachings
of
any
creature
was
still
gold
despite
all
no
matter
the
bruises
and
the
stains
and
the
that
had
done
their
best
to
harden
it
into
bronze
to
debase
it
into
brass
the
camp
was
large
and
a
splendid
picture
of
color
movement
picturesque
combination
and
wonderful
light
and
shadow
as
the
died
out
and
the
fires
were
lighted
for
the
nights
were
now
intensely
cold
cold
with
the
cutting
icy
withering
bise
and
clear
above
as
an
antarctic
night
though
the
days
were
still
hot
and
dry
as
flame
on
the
left
were
the
tirailleurs
the
zouaves
the
zephyrs
on
the
right
were
the
cavalry
and
the
artillery
in
the
center
of
all
was
the
tent
of
the
chief
everywhere
as
evening
fell
the
red
warmth
of
fires
rose
the
caldron
of
soup
or
of
coffee
simmered
above
the
men
lounged
around
talking
laughing
cooking
at
their
pleasure
after
the
of
the
last
week
the
abundance
of
stores
that
had
come
in
with
other
tringlos
besides
poor
biribi
caused
a
universal
hilarity
the
glitter
of
accouterments
the
contents
of
open
knapsacks
the
skins
of
animals
just
killed
for
the
marmite
the
boughs
of
pines
broken
for
firewood
strewed
the
ground
tethered
horses
stands
of
arms
great
drums
and
the
looming
darkness
of
huge
cannon
the
blackness
like
dromedaries
couched
of
caissons
and
the
whiteness
of
the
canvas
tents
the
incessant
movement
as
the
crowds
of
soldiery
stirred
and
chattered
and
worked
and
sang
all
these
on
the
green
level
of
the
plain
framed
in
by
the
towering
masses
of
the
rugged
rocks
made
a
picture
of
marvelous
effect
and
beauty
cecil
looking
at
it
thought
so
though
the
harsh
and
bitter
misery
which
he
knew
that
glittering
scene
enfolded
and
which
he
had
suffered
so
many
years
himself
misery
of
hunger
of
cold
of
of
racking
bodily
pains
stole
from
it
in
his
eyes
that
poetry
and
that
picturesque
brilliancy
which
it
bore
to
the
sight
of
the
artist
and
the
amateur
he
knew
the
naked
terrors
of
war
the
agony
the
travail
the
icy
chills
the
sirocco
heats
the
grinding
routine
the
pitiless
chastisements
of
its
reality
to
those
who
do
it
can
no
longer
be
a
spectacle
dressed
in
the
splendid
array
of
romance
it
is
a
fearful
tragedy
and
farce
woven
close
one
in
another
and
its
sole
joy
is
in
that
which
men
so
lustfully
share
with
the
tiger
and
yet
shudder
from
when
they
have
sated
it
it
was
this
knowledge
of
war
in
its
bitter
and
deadly
truth
which
had
made
him
give
the
answer
that
had
charmed
cigarette
to
the
casual
visitor
of
the
encampment
he
sat
now
having
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
day
of
zaraila
within
a
little
distance
of
the
fire
at
which
his
men
were
stewing
some
soup
in
the
great
simmering
copper
bowl
they
had
eaten
nothing
for
nigh
a
week
except
some
moldy
bread
with
the
chance
of
a
stray
cat
or
a
shot
bird
to
flavor
it
hunger
was
a
common
thorn
in
algerian
warfare
since
not
even
the
matchless
intendance
of
france
could
regularly
supply
the
troops
across
those
interminable
breadths
of
arid
land
those
plains
swept
by
arab
foragers
beau
victor
you
took
their
parts
well
said
a
voice
behind
him
as
cigarette
vaulted
over
a
pile
of
knapsacks
and
stood
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
with
a
little
pipe
in
her
pretty
rosebud
mouth
and
her
cap
set
daintily
on
one
side
of
her
curls
he
looked
up
and
smiled
not
so
well
as
your
own
clever
tongue
would
have
done
words
are
not
my
no
you
are
as
silent
as
the
grave
commonly
but
when
you
do
speak
you
speak
well
said
the
vivandiere
condescendingly
i
hate
silence
myself
thoughts
are
very
good
grain
but
if
they
are
not
whirled
round
round
round
and
winnowed
and
ground
in
the
millstones
of
talk
they
keep
little
hard
useless
kernels
that
not
a
soul
can
with
which
metaphor
cigarette
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
night
air
looking
the
prettiest
little
genre
picture
in
the
ruddy
firelight
that
ever
was
painted
on
such
a
background
of
wavering
shadow
and
undulating
flame
will
your
allegory
hold
good
petite
smiled
cecil
thinking
but
little
of
his
answer
or
of
his
companion
of
whose
service
to
him
he
remained
utterly
ignorant
i
fancy
speech
is
the
chaff
most
generally
little
better
so
they
talk
of
you
for
the
cross
no
soldier
ever
of
a
surety
more
greatly
deserved
her
eyes
gleamed
with
a
luster
like
the
african
planets
above
her
her
face
caught
all
the
fire
the
light
the
illumination
of
the
flames
flashing
near
her
i
did
nothing
she
said
curtly
any
man
on
the
field
would
have
done
the
that
is
easy
to
say
not
so
easy
to
prove
in
all
great
events
there
may
be
the
same
strength
courage
and
desire
to
act
greatly
in
those
who
follow
as
in
the
one
that
leads
but
it
is
only
in
that
one
that
there
is
also
the
daring
to
originate
the
genius
to
seize
aright
the
moment
of
action
and
of
cigarette
was
a
little
hero
she
was
moreover
a
little
desperado
but
she
was
a
child
in
years
and
a
woman
at
heart
valiant
and
ruthless
young
soldier
though
she
might
be
she
colored
all
over
her
mignonne
face
at
the
words
of
eulogy
from
this
man
whom
she
had
told
herself
she
hated
her
eyes
filled
her
lips
trembled
it
was
nothing
she
said
softly
under
her
breath
i
would
die
twenty
deaths
for
he
looked
at
her
and
for
the
hour
understood
her
aright
he
saw
that
there
was
the
love
for
her
country
and
the
power
of
sacrifice
in
this
and
capricious
little
hawk
of
the
desert
you
have
a
noble
nature
cigarette
he
said
with
an
earnest
regard
at
her
my
poor
child
if
only
he
paused
he
was
thinking
what
it
was
hard
to
say
to
her
if
only
the
accidents
of
her
life
had
been
different
what
beauty
race
and
genius
might
have
been
developed
out
of
the
untamed
untutored
inconsequent
but
glorious
nature
of
the
as
by
a
fate
unconsciously
his
pity
embittered
all
the
delight
his
praise
had
given
and
this
implied
regret
for
her
stung
her
as
the
rend
of
the
spur
a
young
arab
colt
stung
her
inwardly
into
cruel
wrath
and
pain
outwardly
into
irony
deviltry
and
contemptuous
retort
oh
child
indeed
was
i
a
child
the
other
day
my
good
fellow
when
i
saved
your
squadron
from
being
cut
to
pieces
like
grass
with
a
scythe
as
for
nobility
pouf
not
much
of
that
in
me
i
love
france
yes
a
soldier
always
loves
his
country
she
is
so
brave
too
and
so
fair
and
so
gay
not
like
your
albion
if
it
is
yours
who
is
a
great
gobemouche
stuffed
full
of
cotton
steaming
with
fog
clutching
gold
with
one
hand
and
the
bible
with
the
other
that
she
may
swell
her
and
seem
a
saint
all
the
same
never
laughing
never
learning
always
growling
always
shuffling
who
is
like
this
spider
look
a
tiny
body
and
huge
hairy
legs
pull
her
legs
the
colonies
off
and
leave
her
little
english
body
all
shriveled
and
shrunk
alone
and
i
should
like
to
know
what
size
she
would
be
then
and
how
she
would
manage
to
swell
and
to
strut
wherewith
cigarette
tossed
the
spider
into
the
air
with
all
the
supreme
disdain
she
could
impel
into
that
gesture
cigarette
though
she
knew
not
her
a
b
c
and
could
not
have
written
her
name
to
save
her
own
life
had
a
certain
bright
intelligence
of
her
own
that
caught
up
political
tidings
and
grasped
at
public
subjects
with
a
skill
education
alone
will
not
bestow
one
way
and
another
she
had
heard
most
of
the
floating
opinions
of
the
day
and
stored
them
up
in
her
fertile
brain
as
a
bee
stores
honey
into
his
hive
by
much
as
and
unconscious
an
instinct
as
the
bee
own
cecil
listened
amused
you
little
anglophobist
you
have
the
tongue
of
a
voltaire
voltaire
questioned
cigarette
voltaire
let
me
see
i
know
that
name
he
was
the
man
who
championed
calas
who
had
a
fowl
in
the
pot
for
every
poor
wretch
that
passed
his
house
who
was
taken
to
the
pantheon
by
the
people
in
the
revolution
yes
and
the
man
whom
the
wise
world
pretends
still
to
call
without
a
heart
or
a
god
chut
he
fed
the
poor
and
freed
the
wronged
better
than
pattering
paters
that
said
cigarette
who
thought
a
midnight
mass
at
notre
dame
or
a
salutation
at
the
madeleine
a
pretty
coup
de
theatre
enough
but
who
had
for
all
churches
and
creeds
a
serene
contempt
and
a
fierce
disdain
go
to
the
grandams
and
the
children
she
would
say
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
to
a
priest
whenever
one
in
algiers
or
paris
attempted
to
reclaim
her
and
a
son
of
the
order
of
jesus
famed
for
persuasiveness
and
eloquence
had
been
fairly
beaten
once
when
in
the
ardor
of
an
african
missionary
he
had
sought
to
argue
with
the
little
bohemian
of
the
tricolor
and
had
had
his
logic
rent
in
twain
and
his
rhetoric
scattered
like
dust
under
the
merciless
and
the
sarcastic
artillery
of
cigarette
replies
and
inquiries
hola
she
cried
leaving
voltaire
for
what
took
her
fancy
we
talk
of
albion
there
is
one
of
her
sons
i
detest
your
country
but
i
must
confess
she
breeds
uncommonly
handsome
she
was
a
dilettante
in
handsome
men
she
nodded
her
head
now
to
where
some
yards
off
at
another
of
the
stood
with
some
officers
of
the
regiment
one
of
the
tourists
a
very
tall
very
fair
man
with
a
gallant
bearing
and
a
tawny
beard
that
glittered
to
gold
in
the
light
of
the
flames
cecil
glance
followed
cigarette
with
a
great
cry
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
entranced
gazing
at
the
stranger
she
saw
the
startled
amaze
the
longing
love
the
agony
of
recognition
in
his
eyes
she
saw
the
impulse
in
him
to
spring
forward
and
the
shuddering
effort
with
which
the
impulse
was
controlled
he
turned
to
her
almost
fiercely
he
must
not
see
me
keep
him
away
away
for
god
sake
he
could
not
leave
his
men
he
was
fettered
there
where
his
squadron
was
camped
he
went
as
far
as
he
could
from
the
into
the
shadow
and
thrust
himself
among
the
tethered
horses
cigarette
asked
nothing
comprehended
at
a
glance
with
all
the
tact
of
her
nation
and
sauntered
forward
to
meet
the
officers
of
the
regiment
as
they
came
up
to
the
with
the
english
stranger
she
knew
how
charming
a
picture
there
with
her
hands
lightly
resting
on
her
hips
and
her
bright
face
danced
on
by
the
ruddy
she
made
she
knew
she
could
hold
thus
the
attention
of
a
whole
brigade
the
eyes
of
the
stranger
lighted
on
her
and
his
voice
laughed
in
mellow
music
to
his
companions
and
ciceroni
your
intendance
is
perfect
your
ambulance
is
perfect
your
is
perfect
messieurs
and
here
you
have
even
perfect
beauty
too
truly
campaigning
must
be
pleasant
work
in
algeria
then
he
turned
to
her
with
compliments
frank
and
gay
and
full
of
a
debonair
grace
that
made
her
doubt
he
could
be
of
albion
retort
was
always
ready
to
her
and
she
kept
the
circle
of
officers
in
full
laughter
round
the
fire
with
a
shower
of
repartee
that
would
have
made
her
fortune
on
the
stage
and
every
now
and
then
her
glance
wandered
to
the
shadow
where
the
horses
were
tethered
bah
why
was
she
always
doing
him
service
she
could
not
have
told
still
she
went
on
and
did
it
it
was
a
fantastic
picture
by
the
bright
scarlet
light
of
the
with
the
little
one
in
her
full
glory
of
mirth
and
mischief
and
her
circle
of
officers
laughing
on
her
with
admiring
eyes
nearest
her
the
towering
height
of
the
english
stranger
with
the
gleam
of
the
flame
in
the
waves
of
his
leonine
beard
from
the
darkness
where
the
scores
of
gray
horses
were
tethered
cecil
eyes
were
riveted
on
it
there
were
none
near
to
see
him
had
there
been
they
would
have
seen
an
agony
in
his
eyes
that
no
physical
misery
no
torture
of
the
battlefield
had
brought
there
his
face
was
bloodless
and
his
gaze
strained
through
the
gleam
on
to
the
group
with
a
passionate
intensity
of
yearning
he
was
well
used
to
pain
well
used
to
well
used
to
but
for
the
first
time
in
his
exile
the
bitterness
of
a
struggle
almost
vanquished
him
all
the
old
love
of
his
youth
went
out
to
this
man
so
near
to
him
yet
so
hopelessly
severed
from
him
looking
on
the
face
of
his
friend
a
violence
of
longing
shook
him
o
god
if
i
were
dead
he
thought
they
might
know
then
he
would
have
died
gladly
to
have
had
that
familiar
hand
once
more
touch
his
those
familiar
eyes
once
more
look
on
him
with
the
generous
tender
trust
of
old
his
brain
reeled
his
thoughts
grew
blind
as
he
stood
there
among
his
horses
with
the
stir
and
tumult
of
the
bivouac
about
him
there
was
nothing
simpler
nothing
less
strange
than
that
an
english
soldier
should
visit
the
camp
but
to
him
it
seemed
like
a
resurrection
of
the
dead
whether
it
was
a
brief
moment
or
an
hour
through
that
the
circle
stood
about
the
great
black
caldron
that
was
swinging
above
the
flames
he
could
not
have
told
to
him
it
was
an
eternity
the
echo
of
the
mellow
ringing
tones
that
he
knew
so
well
came
to
him
from
the
distance
till
his
heart
seemed
breaking
with
but
one
forbidden
longing
to
look
once
more
in
those
brave
eyes
that
made
every
coward
and
liar
quail
and
say
only
i
was
it
is
bitter
to
know
those
whom
we
love
dead
but
it
is
more
bitter
to
be
as
dead
to
those
who
once
having
loved
us
have
sunk
our
memory
deep
beneath
oblivion
that
is
not
the
oblivion
of
the
grave
a
while
and
the
group
broke
up
and
was
scattered
the
english
traveler
throwing
gold
pieces
by
the
score
among
the
waiting
troopers
a
bientot
they
called
to
cigarette
who
nodded
farewell
to
them
with
a
cigar
in
her
mouth
and
busied
herself
pouring
some
brandy
into
the
old
copper
caldron
in
which
some
black
coffee
and
muddy
water
three
parts
sand
was
boiling
a
few
moments
later
and
they
were
out
of
sight
among
the
confusion
the
crowds
and
the
flickering
shadows
of
the
camp
when
they
were
quite
gone
she
came
softly
to
him
she
could
not
see
him
well
in
the
gloom
but
she
touched
his
hand
dieu
how
cold
you
are
he
is
he
could
not
answer
her
to
thank
her
but
he
crushed
in
his
the
little
warm
brown
palm
she
felt
a
shiver
shake
his
limbs
is
he
your
enemy
she
asked
what
then
the
man
i
love
best
on
ah
she
had
felt
a
surprise
she
had
not
spoke
that
he
should
flee
thus
from
any
foe
he
thinks
you
dead
then
and
must
always
think
so
he
held
her
hand
still
and
his
own
wrung
it
hard
the
grasp
of
comrade
to
comrade
not
of
man
to
woman
child
you
are
bold
generous
pitiful
for
god
sake
get
me
sent
out
of
this
camp
i
am
there
was
that
in
the
accent
which
struck
his
listener
to
the
heart
he
was
powerless
fettered
hand
and
foot
as
though
he
were
a
prisoner
a
night
absence
and
he
would
be
shot
as
a
deserter
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
this
rendering
up
of
all
his
life
to
the
rules
of
others
but
now
and
then
the
galled
spirit
chafed
the
netted
stag
strained
at
the
bonds
i
will
try
said
cigarette
simply
without
any
of
her
audacity
or
of
her
vanity
in
the
answer
go
you
to
the
fire
you
are
are
you
sure
he
will
not
return
not
he
they
are
gone
to
eat
and
drink
i
go
with
them
what
is
it
you
fear
my
own
she
was
silent
she
could
just
watch
his
features
by
the
dim
light
and
she
saw
his
mouth
quiver
under
the
fullness
of
his
beard
he
felt
that
if
he
looked
again
on
the
face
of
the
man
he
loved
he
might
be
broken
into
and
unloose
his
silence
and
shatter
all
the
work
of
so
many
years
he
had
been
strong
where
men
of
harder
fiber
and
less
ductile
temper
might
have
been
feeble
but
he
never
thought
that
he
had
been
so
he
only
thought
that
he
had
acted
on
impulse
and
had
remained
true
to
his
act
through
the
mere
instinct
of
honor
an
instinct
inborn
in
his
blood
and
his
order
an
instinct
natural
and
unconscious
with
him
as
the
instinct
by
which
he
drove
his
breath
you
are
a
fine
soldier
said
cigarette
musingly
such
men
are
not
why
we
are
only
strong
as
tigers
are
strong
just
the
strength
of
the
talon
and
fang
i
do
not
know
i
was
weak
as
water
once
i
may
be
again
if
if
he
scarcely
knew
that
he
was
speaking
aloud
he
had
forgotten
her
his
whole
heart
seemed
burned
as
with
fire
by
the
memory
of
that
one
face
so
familiar
so
well
loved
yet
from
which
he
must
shrink
as
though
some
cowardly
sin
were
between
them
the
wretchedness
on
him
seemed
more
than
he
could
bear
to
know
that
this
man
was
so
near
that
the
sound
of
his
voice
raised
could
summon
him
yet
that
he
must
remain
as
dead
to
him
remain
as
one
dead
after
a
craven
and
treacherous
guilt
he
turned
suddenly
almost
violently
upon
cigarette
you
have
surprised
my
folly
from
me
you
know
my
secret
so
far
but
you
are
too
brave
to
betray
me
you
are
too
generous
to
tell
of
this
i
can
trust
you
to
be
silent
her
face
flushed
scarlet
with
astonished
anger
her
little
childlike
form
grew
instinct
with
haughty
and
fiery
dignity
monsieur
that
question
from
one
soldier
of
france
to
another
is
insult
we
are
not
dastards
there
was
a
certain
grave
reproach
that
mingled
with
the
indignant
scorn
of
the
answer
and
showed
that
her
own
heart
was
wounded
by
the
doubt
as
well
as
her
military
pride
by
the
aspersion
even
amid
the
conflict
of
pain
at
war
in
him
he
felt
that
and
hastened
to
soothe
it
forgive
me
my
child
i
should
not
have
wronged
you
with
the
question
it
is
needless
i
know
men
can
trust
you
to
the
death
they
to
the
death
the
answer
was
thoughtful
dreamy
almost
sad
for
cigarette
his
thoughts
were
too
far
from
her
in
their
tumult
of
awakened
memories
to
note
the
tone
as
he
went
rapidly
on
you
have
ingenuity
compassion
tact
you
have
power
here
too
in
your
way
for
the
love
of
heaven
get
me
sent
out
on
some
duty
before
dawn
there
is
biribi
murder
to
be
avenged
would
they
give
the
errand
to
me
she
thought
a
moment
we
will
see
she
said
curtly
i
think
i
can
do
it
but
go
back
or
you
will
be
missed
i
will
come
to
you
she
left
him
then
rapidly
drawing
her
hand
quickly
out
of
the
clasp
of
his
cigarette
felt
her
heart
aching
to
its
core
for
the
sorrow
of
this
man
who
was
nothing
to
her
he
did
not
know
what
she
had
done
for
him
in
his
suffering
and
delirium
he
did
not
know
how
she
had
watched
him
all
that
night
through
when
she
was
weary
and
bruised
and
thirsting
for
sleep
he
did
not
know
he
held
her
hand
as
one
comrade
another
and
never
looked
to
see
if
her
eyes
were
blue
or
were
black
were
laughing
or
and
yet
she
felt
pain
in
his
pain
she
was
always
giving
her
life
to
his
service
many
besides
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
beat
back
as
folly
the
noblest
and
purest
thing
in
them
cecil
mechanically
returned
to
the
fire
at
which
the
men
of
his
tribe
were
cooking
their
welcome
supper
and
sat
down
near
them
rejecting
with
a
gesture
the
most
savory
portion
which
with
their
customary
love
and
care
for
him
they
were
careful
to
select
and
bring
to
him
there
had
never
been
a
time
when
they
had
found
him
fail
to
prefer
them
to
himself
or
fail
to
do
them
kindly
service
if
of
such
he
had
a
chance
and
they
returned
it
with
all
that
rough
and
silent
attachment
that
can
be
so
strong
and
so
stanch
in
lives
that
may
be
black
with
crime
or
red
with
slaughter
he
sat
like
a
man
in
a
dream
while
the
loosened
tongues
of
the
men
ran
noisily
on
a
hundred
themes
as
they
chaffed
each
other
exchanged
a
fire
of
bivouac
jokes
more
racy
than
decorous
and
gave
themselves
to
the
enjoyment
of
their
rude
meal
that
had
to
them
that
savor
which
long
hunger
alone
can
give
their
voices
came
dull
on
his
ear
the
ruddy
warmth
of
the
fire
was
obscured
to
his
sight
the
din
the
laughter
the
stir
all
over
the
great
camp
at
the
hour
of
dinner
were
lost
on
him
he
was
insensible
to
everything
except
the
innumerable
memories
that
thronged
upon
him
and
the
aching
longing
that
filled
his
heart
with
the
sight
of
the
friend
of
his
youth
he
said
once
that
he
would
take
my
hand
before
all
the
world
always
come
what
would
he
thought
would
he
take
it
now
i
wonder
yes
he
never
believed
against
and
as
he
thought
the
same
anguish
of
desire
that
had
before
smitten
him
to
stand
once
more
guiltless
in
the
presence
of
men
and
once
more
bear
untarnished
the
name
of
his
race
and
the
honor
of
his
fathers
shook
him
now
as
strong
winds
shake
a
tree
that
yet
is
fast
rooted
at
its
base
though
it
sway
a
while
beneath
the
storm
how
weak
i
am
he
thought
bitterly
what
does
it
matter
life
is
so
short
one
is
a
coward
indeed
to
fret
over
it
i
can
not
undo
what
i
did
i
can
not
if
i
could
to
betray
him
now
god
not
for
a
kingdom
if
i
had
the
chance
besides
she
may
live
still
and
even
were
she
dead
to
tarnish
her
name
to
clear
my
own
would
be
a
baseness
baseness
that
would
fail
as
it
merited
for
who
could
be
brought
to
believe
me
now
the
thoughts
unformed
drifted
through
his
mind
half
dulled
half
sharpened
by
the
deadly
pain
and
the
rush
of
old
brotherly
love
that
had
arisen
in
him
as
he
had
seen
the
face
of
his
friend
beside
the
of
the
french
bivouac
it
was
hard
it
was
cruelly
hard
he
had
after
a
long
and
severe
conflict
brought
himself
into
contentment
with
his
lot
and
taught
himself
oblivion
of
the
past
and
interest
in
the
present
by
active
duties
and
firm
resolve
he
had
vanquished
all
the
habits
controlled
most
of
the
weaknesses
and
banished
nearly
all
the
frailties
and
indulgences
of
his
temperament
in
the
long
ordeal
of
african
warfare
it
was
cruelly
hard
that
now
when
he
had
obtained
serenity
and
more
than
half
attained
forgetfulness
these
two
her
face
and
his
must
come
before
him
one
to
recall
the
past
the
other
to
embitter
the
future
as
he
sat
with
his
head
bent
down
and
his
forehead
leaning
on
his
arm
while
the
hard
biscuit
that
served
for
a
plate
stood
unnoticed
beside
him
with
the
food
that
the
soldiers
had
placed
on
it
he
did
not
hear
cigarette
step
till
she
touched
him
on
the
arm
then
he
looked
up
her
eyes
were
looking
on
him
with
a
tender
earnest
pity
hark
i
have
done
it
she
said
gently
but
it
will
be
an
errand
very
close
to
death
that
you
must
go
on
he
raised
himself
erect
eagerly
no
matter
that
ah
mademoiselle
how
i
thank
you
chut
i
am
no
paris
demoiselle
said
cigarette
with
a
dash
of
her
old
acrimony
ceremony
in
a
camp
pouf
you
must
have
been
a
court
chamberlain
once
were
you
well
i
have
done
it
your
officers
were
talking
yonder
of
a
delicate
business
they
were
uncertain
who
best
to
employ
i
put
in
my
speech
it
was
dead
against
military
etiquette
but
i
did
it
i
said
to
le
general
want
the
best
rider
the
most
silent
tongue
and
the
surest
steel
in
the
squadrons
take
then
is
that
asked
the
general
he
would
have
sent
out
of
camp
anybody
but
cigarette
for
the
interruption
general
said
i
arabs
asked
that
too
the
other
day
at
zaraila
he
cried
man
victor
who
held
the
ground
with
his
chasseurs
i
know
a
fine
soldier
le
colonel
shall
we
send
him
the
black
hawk
had
scowled
thunder
on
you
he
hates
you
more
still
since
that
affair
of
zaraila
especially
because
the
general
has
reported
your
conduct
with
such
praise
that
they
can
not
help
but
promote
you
well
he
had
looked
thunder
but
now
he
laughed
mon
general
he
answered
him
him
if
you
like
it
is
fifty
to
one
whoever
goes
on
that
business
will
not
come
back
alive
and
you
will
rid
me
of
the
most
insolent
fine
gentleman
in
my
squadrons
the
general
hardly
heard
him
he
was
deep
in
thought
but
he
asked
a
good
deal
about
you
from
the
hawk
and
chateauroy
spoke
for
your
fitness
for
the
errand
they
are
going
to
send
you
on
very
truthfully
for
a
wonder
i
know
why
but
he
wants
you
to
be
sent
i
think
most
likely
that
you
may
be
cut
to
pieces
and
so
they
will
send
for
you
in
a
minute
i
have
done
it
as
you
there
was
something
of
her
old
brusquerie
and
recklessness
in
the
closing
sentences
but
it
had
not
her
customary
debonair
lightness
she
knew
too
well
that
the
chances
were
as
a
hundred
to
one
that
he
would
never
return
alive
from
this
service
on
which
he
had
entreated
to
be
dispatched
cecil
grasped
both
her
hands
in
his
with
warm
gratitude
that
was
still
like
the
touch
of
his
hands
the
gratitude
of
comrade
to
comrade
not
of
man
to
woman
god
bless
you
cigarette
you
are
a
true
friend
my
child
you
have
done
me
immeasurable
benefits
oh
i
am
a
true
friend
said
the
little
one
somewhat
pettishly
she
would
have
preferred
another
epithet
if
a
man
wants
to
get
shot
as
a
very
great
favor
i
always
let
him
pleasure
himself
give
a
man
his
own
way
if
you
wish
to
be
kind
to
him
you
are
children
all
of
you
nothing
but
children
and
if
the
toy
that
pleases
you
best
is
death
why
you
must
have
it
nothing
else
would
content
you
i
know
you
you
always
want
what
flies
from
you
and
are
tired
of
what
lies
to
your
hand
that
is
always
a
and
a
woman
too
is
it
not
cigarette
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
i
dare
say
we
love
what
is
new
what
is
strange
we

only

when
we

wound
up
with

string
to

make
an
exception
of
yourself
my
child
you
are
always
ready
to
do
a
good
action
and
never
tire
of
that
from
my
heart
i
thank
you
i
wish
to
heaven
i
could
prove
it
she
drew
her
hands
away
from
him
a
great
thing
i
have
done
certainly
got
you
permission
to
go
and
throw
a
cartel
at
old
king
death
that
is
all
there
that
is
your
the
orderly
approached
and
brought
the
bidding
of
the
general
in
command
of
the
cavalry
for
cecil
to
render
himself
at
once
to
his
presence
these
things
brook
no
second
delay
in
obedience
he
went
with
a
quick
adieu
to
cigarette
and
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
was
left
in
his
vacant
place
beside
the
fire
and
there
was
a
pang
at
her
heart
ten
to
one
he
goes
to
his
death
she
thought
but
cigarette
little
though
she
was
could
reach
very
high
in
one
thing
she
could
reach
a
love
that
was
unselfish
and
one
that
was
heroic
a
few
moments
and
cecil
returned
rake
he
said
rapidly
in
the
french
he
habitually
used
saddle
my
horse
and
your
own
i
am
allowed
to
choose
one
of
you
to
accompany
rake
in
paradise
and
the
envied
of
every
man
in
the
squadron
turned
to
his
work
with
him
a
task
of
scarce
more
than
a
second
and
cecil
approached
his
little
friend
of
the
flag
my
child
i
can
not
attempt
to
thank
you
but
for
you
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
send
my
lance
through
my
own
keep
its
lunge
for
the
arbicos
mon
ami
said
cigarette
brusquely
the
more
brusquely
because
that
new
and
bitter
pang
was
on
her
as
for
me
i
want
no
no
you
are
too
generous
but
not
the
less
do
i
wish
i
could
render
them
more
worthily
than
by
words
if
i
live
i
will
try
if
not
keep
this
in
my
memory
it
is
the
only
thing
i
he
put
into
her
hand
the
ring
she
had
seen
in
the
little
box
a
ring
of
his
mother
that
he
had
saved
when
he
had
parted
with
all
else
and
had
put
off
his
hand
and
into
the
box
of
petite
reine
gift
the
day
he
entered
the
algerian
army
cigarette
flushed
scarlet
with
passions
he
could
not
understand
and
she
could
not
have
disentangled
the
ring
of
your
mistress
not
for
me
if
i
know
it
do
you
think
i
want
to
be
paid
the
ring
was
my
mother
he
answered
her
simply
and
i
offer
it
only
as
she
lost
all
her
color
and
all
her
fiery
wrath
his
grave
and
gentle
courtesy
always
strangely
stilled
and
rebuked
her
but
she
raised
the
ring
off
the
ground
where
she
had
flung
it
and
placed
it
back
in
his
hand
if
so
still
less
should
you
part
with
it
keep
it
it
will
bring
you
happiness
one
day
as
for
me
i
have
done
nothing
you
have
done
what
i
value
the
more
for
that
noble
disclaimer
may
i
thank
you
thus
little
one
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
a
kiss
that
the
lips
of
a
man
will
always
give
to
the
bright
youthful
lips
of
a
women
but
a
kiss
as
she
knew
well
without
passion
even
without
tenderness
in
it
with
a
sudden
impetuous
movement
with
a
shyness
and
a
refusal
that
had
never
been
in
her
before
she
wrested
herself
from
him
her
face
burning
her
heart
panting
and
plunged
away
from
him
into
the
depth
of
the
shadow
and
he
never
sought
to
follow
her
but
threw
himself
into
saddle
as
his
gray
was
brought
up
another
instant
and
armed
to
the
teeth
he
rode
out
of
the
camp
into
the
darkness
of
the
silent
melancholy
lonely
arab
night
chapter
xxx
seul
au
monde
the
errand
on
which
he
went
was
one
as
he
was
well
aware
from
which
it
were
a
thousand
chances
to
one
that
he
ever
issued
alive
it
was
to
reach
a
distant
branch
of
the
army
of
occupation
with
dispatches
for
the
chief
in
command
there
and
to
do
this
he
had
to
pass
through
a
fiercely
hostile
region
occupied
by
arabs
with
whom
no
sort
of
peace
had
ever
been
made
the
most
savage
as
well
as
the
most
predatory
of
the
wandering
tribes
his
knowledge
of
their
tongue
and
his
friendship
with
some
men
of
their
nation
would
avail
him
nothing
here
for
their
fury
against
the
franks
was
intense
and
it
was
said
that
all
prisoners
who
had
fallen
into
their
hands
had
been
put
to
death
with
merciless
barbarities
this
might
be
true
or
not
true
wild
tales
were
common
among
algerian
campaigners
whichever
it
were
he
thought
little
of
it
as
he
rode
out
on
to
the
lonely
plains
every
kind
of
hazardous
adventure
and
every
variety
of
peril
had
been
familiar
with
him
in
the
african
life
and
now
there
were
thoughts
and
memories
on
him
which
deadened
every
recollection
of
merely
physical
risk
we
must
ride
as
hard
and
as
fast
as
we
can
and
as
silently
were
the
only
words
he
exchanged
with
rake
as
he
loosened
his
gray
to
a
gallop
all
right
sir
answered
the
trooper
whose
warm
blood
was
dancing
and
whose
blue
eyes
were
alive
like
fire
with
delight
that
he
had
been
absent
on
a
foraging
raid
on
the
day
of
zaraila
had
been
nothing
short
of
agony
to
rake
and
the
choice
made
of
him
for
this
duty
was
to
him
a
gift
of
paradise
he
loved
fighting
for
fighting
sake
and
to
be
beside
cecil
was
the
greatest
happiness
life
held
for
him
they
had
two
hundred
miles
to
traverse
and
had
received
only
the
command
he
had
passed
to
rake
to
ride
hard
fast
and
to
the
hero
of
zaraila
the
general
had
felt
too
much
soldierly
sympathy
to
add
the
superfluous
injunction
to
do
his
uttermost
to
carry
safely
and
successfully
to
their
destination
the
papers
that
were
placed
in
his
care
he
knew
well
that
the
errand
would
be
done
or
the
chasseur
would
be
dead
it
was
just
nightfall
the
had
faded
only
a
few
moments
before
giving
their
horses
which
they
were
to
change
once
ten
hours
for
the
distance
and
two
for
bait
and
for
rest
he
reckoned
that
they
would
reach
the
camp
before
the
noon
of
the
coming
day
as
the
beasts
fresh
and
fast
in
the
camp
flew
like
greyhounds
beneath
them
another
night
ride
that
they
had
ridden
together
came
to
the
minds
of
both
but
they
spoke
not
a
word
as
they
swept
on
their
sabers
shaken
loose
in
their
sheaths
their
lances
well
gripped
and
the
pistols
with
which
they
had
been
supplied
sprung
in
their
belts
ready
for
instant
action
if
a
call
should
come
for
it
every
rood
of
the
way
was
as
full
of
unseen
danger
as
if
laid
over
mines
they
might
pass
in
safety
they
might
any
moment
be
cut
down
by
ten
score
against
two
from
every
hanging
scarp
of
rugged
rock
a
storm
of
might
pour
from
every
screen
of
foliage
a
shower
of
lances
might
whistle
through
the
air
from
every
darkling
grove
of
fir
trees
an
arab
band
might
spring
and
swoop
on
them
but
the
knowledge
scarcely
recurred
to
the
one
save
to
make
him
shake
his
sword
more
loose
for
quick
disengagement
and
only
made
the
sunny
blue
eyes
of
the
other
sparkle
with
a
vivid
and
longing
zest
the
night
grew
very
chill
as
it
wore
on
the
north
wind
rose
rushing
against
them
with
a
force
and
icy
touch
that
seemed
to
freeze
their
bones
to
the
marrow
after
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
sun
that
had
scorched
them
so
long
there
was
no
regular
road
they
went
across
the
country
their
way
sometimes
leading
over
level
land
over
which
they
swept
like
lightning
great
plains
succeeding
one
another
with
wearisome
monotony
sometimes
on
the
contrary
lying
through
ravines
and
defiles
and
gloomy
woods
and
broken
hilly
spaces
where
rent
bare
rocks
were
thrown
on
one
another
in
gigantic
confusion
and
the
fantastic
shapes
of
the
wild
fig
and
the
dwarf
palm
gathered
a
hideous
grotesqueness
in
the
darkness
for
there
was
no
moon
and
the
stars
were
often
hidden
by
the
of
leaden
clouds
that
drifted
over
the
sky
and
the
only
sound
they
heard
was
the
cry
of
the
jackal
or
the
shriek
of
the
night
bird
and
now
and
then
the
sound
of
shallow
where
the
parched
beds
of
hidden
brooks
had
been
filled
by
the
autumnal
rain
the
first
miles
passed
without
interruption
and
the
horses
lay
well
and
warmly
to
their
work
they
halted
to
rest
and
bait
the
beasts
in
a
rocky
hollow
sheltered
from
the
blasts
of
the
bise
and
green
with
short
sweet
grass
sprung
up
afresh
after
the
summer
drought
do
you
ever
think
of
him
sir
said
rake
softly
with
a
lingering
love
in
his
voice
as
he
stroked
the
grays
and
tethered
them
of
whom
of
the
king
sir
if
he
alive
he
getting
a
rare
old
horse
think
of
him
i
wish
i
did
not
would
you
like
to
see
him
agen
sir
what
folly
to
ask
you
know
yes
sir
i
know
said
rake
slowly
and
i
know
leastways
i
picked
it
out
of
a
old
paper
that
your
elder
brother
died
sir
like
the
old
lord
and
berk
got
the
rake
had
longed
and
pined
for
an
opportunity
to
dare
say
this
thing
which
he
had
learned
and
which
he
could
not
tell
whether
or
no
cecil
knew
likewise
his
eyes
looked
with
straining
eagerness
through
the
gloom
into
his
master
he
was
uncertain
how
his
words
would
be
taken
to
his
bitter
disappointment
cecil
face
showed
no
change
no
wonder
i
have
heard
that
he
said
calmly
as
calmly
as
though
the
news
had
no
bearing
on
his
fortunes
but
was
some
stranger
history
well
sir
but
he
ai
the
lord
pleaded
rake
passionately
he
never
be
while
you
living
sir
oh
yes
he
is
i
am
dead
you
but
he
wo
sir
reiterated
rake
you
lord
royallieu
if
ever
there
was
a
lord
royallieu
and
if
ever
there
will
be
you
mistake
an
outlaw
has
no
civil
rights
and
can
claim
the
man
looked
very
wistfully
at
him
all
these
years
through
he
had
never
learned
why
his
master
was
thus
dead
in
africa
and
he
had
too
loyal
a
love
and
faith
ever
to
ask
or
ever
to
doubt
but
that
cecil
was
the
wronged
and
not
the
you
ai
a
outlaw
sir
he
muttered
you
could
take
the
title
if
you
oh
no
i
left
england
under
a
criminal
charge
i
should
have
to
disprove
that
before
i
could
rake
crushed
bitter
oaths
into
muttered
words
as
he
heard
you
could
disprove
it
sir
of
course
right
and
away
if
you
no
or
i
should
not
have
come
here
let
us
leave
the
subject
it
was
settled
long
ago
my
brother
is
lord
royallieu
i
would
not
disturb
him
if
i
had
the
power
and
i
have
not
it
look
the
horses
are
taking
well
to
their
rake
asked
him
no
more
he
had
never
had
a
harsh
word
from
cecil
in
their
lives
but
he
knew
him
too
well
for
all
that
to
venture
to
press
on
him
a
question
thus
firmly
put
aside
but
his
heart
ached
sorely
for
his
master
he
would
so
gladly
have
seen
the
king
among
his
own
again
and
would
have
striven
for
the
restoration
as
strenuously
as
ever
a
cavalier
strove
for
the
white
rose
and
he
sat
in
silence
perplexed
and
ill
satisfied
under
the
shelter
of
the
rock
with
the
great
dim
desolate
african
landscape
stretching
before
him
with
here
and
there
a
gleam
of
light
upon
it
when
the
wind
swept
the
clouds
apart
his
volatile
speech
was
chilled
and
his
buoyant
spirits
were
checked
that
cecil
was
justly
outlawed
he
would
have
thought
it
the
foulest
treason
to
believe
for
one
instant
yet
he
felt
that
he
might
as
soon
seek
to
wrench
up
the
great
stones
above
him
from
their
base
as
seek
to
change
the
resolution
of
this
man
whom
he
had
once
known
pliant
as
a
reed
and
careless
as
a
child
they
were
before
long
in
saddle
again
and
off
the
country
growing
wilder
at
each
stride
the
horses
took
it
is
all
alive
with
arabs
for
the
next
ten
leagues
said
cecil
as
he
settled
himself
in
his
saddle
they
have
come
northward
and
been
sweeping
the
country
like
a
and
we
shall
blunder
on
some
of
them
sooner
or
later
if
they
cut
me
down
do
wait
but
slash
my
pouch
loose
and
ride
off
with
all
right
sir
said
rake
obediently
but
he
thought
to
himself
leave
you
alone
with
them
demons
damn
me
if
i
will
and
away
they
went
once
more
in
speed
and
in
silence
the
darkness
of
full
night
closing
in
on
them
the
skies
being
black
with
the
heavy
drift
of
rising
meanwhile
cigarette
was
feasting
with
the
officers
of
the
regiment
the
dinner
was
the
best
that
the
could
furnish
in
honor
of
the
two
or
three
illustrious
tourists
who
were
on
a
visit
to
the
headquarters
of
the
algerian
army
and
the
little
one
the
heroine
of
zaraila
and
the
toast
of
every
mess
throughout
algeria
was
as
indispensable
as
the
champagnes
not
that
she
was
altogether
herself
she
was
feverish
she
was
bitter
she
was
full
of
stinging
ironies
but
that
delicious
gayety
like
a
kitten
play
was
gone
from
her
and
its
place
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
was
supplied
by
unreal
and
hectic
excitation
in
truth
while
she
laughed
and
coquetted
and
fenced
with
the
bright
blade
of
her
wit
and
tossed
down
the
wines
into
her
little
throat
like
a
trooper
she
was
thinking
nothing
at
all
of
what
was
around
her
and
very
little
of
what
she
said
or
she
did
she
was
thinking
of
the
starless
night
out
yonder
of
the
bleak
arid
country
of
the
great
dim
measureless
plains
of
one
who
was
passing
through
them
all
and
one
who
might
never
return
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
absent
had
ever
troubled
her
present
it
was
the
first
time
that
ever
this
foolish
senseless
haunting
unconquerable
fear
for
another
had
approached
her
fear
she
had
never
known
it
for
herself
why
should
she
feel
it
now
for
him
a
man
whose
lips
had
touched
her
own
as
lightly
as
indifferently
as
they
might
have
touched
the
leaves
of
a
rose
or
the
curls
of
a
dog
she
felt
her
face
burn
with
the
flash
of
a
keen
unbearable
passionate
shame
men
by
the
score
had
wooed
her
love
to
be
flouted
with
the
insouciant
mischief
of
her
coquetry
and
forgotten
if
they
were
shot
and
now
he
he
whose
careless
calm
caress
would
make
her
heart
vibrate
and
her
limbs
tremble
with
an
emotion
she
had
never
known
he
valued
her
love
so
little
that
he
never
even
knew
that
he
had
roused
it
to
the
proud
young
warrior
of
france
a
greater
degradation
a
deadlier
humiliation
than
this
could
not
have
come
yet
she
was
true
as
steel
to
him
true
with
the
strong
and
loyal
fealty
that
is
inborn
with
such
natures
as
hers
to
have
betrayed
what
he
had
trusted
to
her
because
she
was
neglected
and
wounded
by
him
would
have
been
a
feminine
baseness
of
which
the
soul
of
cigarette
would
have
been
totally
incapable
her
revenge
might
be
fierce
and
rapid
and
sure
like
the
revenge
of
a
soldier
but
it
could
never
be
stealing
and
traitorous
and
never
like
the
revenge
of
a
woman
not
a
word
escaped
her
that
could
have
given
a
clew
to
the
secret
with
which
he
had
involuntarily
weighted
her
she
only
studied
with
interest
and
keenness
the
face
and
the
words
of
this
man
whom
he
had
loved
and
from
whom
he
had
fled
as
criminals
flee
from
their
accusers
what
is
your
name
she
asked
him
curtly
in
one
of
the
pauses
of
the
amorous
and
witty
nonsense
that
circulated
in
the
tent
in
which
the
officers
of
chasseurs
were
entertaining
him
well
some
call
me
ah
you
have
petite
names
then
in
albion
i
should
have
though
she
was
too
somber
and
too
stiff
for
them
besides
what
a
droll
name
what
are
you
a
good
what
grade
a
colonel
of
cigarette
gave
a
little
whistle
to
herself
she
remembered
that
a
marshal
of
france
had
once
said
of
a
certain
chasseur
he
has
the
seat
of
the
english
my
pretty
catechist
le
duc
does
not
tell
you
his
title
cried
one
of
the
officers
cigarette
interrupted
him
with
a
toss
of
her
head
ouf
titles
are
nothing
to
me
i
am
a
child
of
the
people
so
you
are
a
duke
are
you
le
seraph
well
that
is
not
much
to
my
thinking
bah
there
is
fialin
made
a
duke
in
paris
and
there
are
aristocrats
here
wearing
privates
uniforms
and
littering
down
their
own
horses
bah
have
you
that
sort
of
thing
in
albion
attorneys
throned
on
high
and
gentlemen
glad
to
sweep
crossings
oh
yes
laughed
her
interlocutor
but
you
speak
of
aristocrats
in
your
ranks
that
reminds
me
have
you
not
in
this
corps
a
soldier
called
louis
victor
he
had
turned
as
he
spoke
to
one
of
the
officers
who
answered
him
in
the
affirmative
while
cigarette
listened
with
all
her
curiosity
and
all
her
interest
that
needed
a
deeper
name
heightened
and
a
fine
fellow
continued
the
chef
to
whom
he
had
appealed
he
behaved
magnificently
the
other
day
at
zaraila
he
must
be
distinguished
for
it
he
is
just
sent
on
a
perilous
errand
but
though
so
quiet
he
is
a
and
woe
to
the
arabs
who
slay
him
are
you
acquainted
with
him
not
in
the
least
but
i
wished
to
hear
all
i
could
of
him
i
have
been
told
he
seems
above
his
present
position
is
it
so
likely
enough
monsieur
he
seems
a
gentleman
but
then
we
have
many
gentlemen
in
the
ranks
and
we
can
make
no
difference
for
that
cigarette
can
tell
you
more
of
him
she
used
to
complain
that
he
bowed
like
a
court
oh
ha
i
did
cried
cigarette
stung
into
instant
irony
because
pained
and
irritated
by
being
appealed
to
on
the
subject
and
of
course
when
so
many
of
his
officers
have
the
manners
of
pyrenean
bears
it
is
a
little
awkward
for
him
to
bring
us
the
manner
of
a
palace
which
effectually
chastised
the
chef
who
was
one
of
those
who
had
a
ton
of
the
roughest
manners
and
piqued
himself
on
his
powers
of
fence
much
more
than
on
his
habits
of
delicacy
has
this
victor
any
history
asked
the
english
duke
he
has
written
one
with
his
sword
a
fine
one
said
cigarette
curtly
we
are
not
given
here
to
care
much
about
any
quite
right
i
asked
because
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
seen
his
carvings
wished
to
serve
him
if
it
were
possible
and
ho
that
is
milady
is
suppose
cigarette
eyes
flashed
fire
instantly
in
wrath
and
suspicion
what
did
she
tell
you
about
him
i
am
ignorant
of
whom
you
speak
he
answered
with
something
of
surprise
and
annoyance
are
you
said
cigarette
in
derision
i
doubt
that
of
whom
should
i
speak
but
of
her
bah
she
insulted
him
she
offered
him
gold
she
sent
my
men
the
spoils
of
her
table
as
if
they
were
paupers
and
he
thinks
it
all
divine
because
it
is
done
by
mme
la
princesse
corona
bah
when
he
was
delirious
the
other
night
he
could
babble
of
nothing
but
of
her
of
her
of
her
the
jealous
fiery
impatience
in
her
vanquished
every
other
thought
she
was
a
child
in
much
she
was
untutored
in
all
she
had
no
thought
that
by
the
scornful
vituperation
of
milady
she
could
either
harm
cecil
or
betray
herself
but
she
was
amazed
to
see
the
english
guest
change
color
with
a
haughty
anger
that
he
strove
to
subdue
as
he
half
rose
and
answered
her
with
an
accent
in
his
voice
that
reminded
her
she
knew
not
why
of
and
of
marquise
mme
la
princess
corona
is
my
sister
why
do
you
venture
to
couple
the
name
of
this
chasseur
with
hers
cigarette
sprang
to
her
feet
vivacious
imperious
reckless
dared
to
anything
by
the
mere
fact
of
being
publicly
arraigned
pardieu
is
it
insult
to
couple
the
silver
pheasant
with
the
eagles
of
france
a
pretty
idea
truly
so
she
is
your
sister
is
she
milady
well
then
tell
her
from
me
to
think
twice
before
she
outrages
a
soldier
with
and
tell
her
too
that
had
i
been
he
i
would
have
ground
my
ivory
toys
into
powder
before
i
would
have
let
them
become
the
playthings
of
a
grande
dame
who
tendered
me
gold
for
them
the
englishman
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
that
was
mingled
with
a
vivid
sense
of
intense
annoyance
and
irritated
pride
that
the
name
he
cherished
closest
should
be
thus
brought
in
at
a
camp
dinner
on
the
lips
of
a
vivandiere
and
in
connection
with
a
trooper
of
chasseurs
i
do
not
understand
your
indignation
mademoiselle
he
said
with
an
impatient
stroke
to
his
beard
there
is
no
occasion
for
it
mme
corona
my
sister
he
continued
to
the
officers
present
became
accidentally
acquainted
with
the
skill
at
sculpture
of
this
corporal
of
yours
he
appeared
to
her
a
man
of
much
refinement
and
good
breeding
she
chanced
to
name
him
to
me
and
feeling
some
pity
m
le
duc
cried
the
ringing
voice
of
cigarette
loud
and
startling
as
a
while
she
stood
like
a
little
lioness
flushed
with
the
draughts
of
champagne
and
with
the
warmth
of
wrath
at
once
jealous
and
generous
keep
your
compassion
until
it
is
asked
of
you
no
soldier
of
france
needs
it
that
i
promise
you
i
know
this
man
that
you
talk
of
well
i
saw
him
at
zaraila
three
weeks
ago
he
had
drawn
up
his
men
to
die
with
them
rather
than
surrender
and
yield
up
the
guidon
i
dragged
him
half
dead
when
the
field
was
won
from
under
his
horse
and
his
first
conscious
act
was
to
give
the
drink
that
i
brought
him
to
a
wretch
who
had
thieved
from
him
our
life
here
is
hell
upon
earth
to
such
as
he
yet
none
ever
heard
a
lament
wrung
out
of
him
he
is
gone
to
the
chances
of
death
as
most
men
go
to
their
kisses
he
is
a
soldier
napoleon
would
have
honored
such
a
one
is
not
to
have
the
patronage
of
a
milady
corona
nor
the
pity
of
a
stranger
of
england
let
the
first
respect
him
let
the
last
imitate
him
and
cigarette
having
pronounced
her
defense
and
her
eulogy
with
the
vibrating
eloquence
of
some
orator
from
a
tribune
threw
her
champagne
goblet
down
with
a
crash
and
breaking
through
the
arms
outstretched
to
detain
her
forced
her
way
out
despite
them
and
left
her
hosts
alone
in
their
lighted
tent
cigarette
said
the
chef
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
of
one
who
explained
by
that
sentence
a
whole
world
of
irreclaimable
eccentricities
a
strange
little
amazon
said
their
guest
is
she
in
love
with
this
victor
that
i
have
offended
her
so
much
with
his
name
the
major
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
know
that
monsieur
answered
one
she
will
defend
a
man
in
his
absence
and
rate
him
to
his
face
most
soundly
cigarette
whirls
about
like
a
little
paper
windmill
just
as
the
breeze
blows
but
as
the
windmill
never
leaves
its
stick
so
she
is
always
constant
to
the
their
guest
said
little
more
on
the
subject
in
his
own
thoughts
he
was
bitterly
resentful
that
by
the
mention
of
this
chasseur
fortunes
he
should
have
brought
in
the
name
he
loved
so
well
the
purest
fairest
haughtiest
name
in
europe
into
a
discussion
with
a
vivandiere
at
a
camp
dinner
chateauroy
throughout
had
said
nothing
he
had
listened
in
silence
the
darkness
lowering
still
more
heavily
upon
his
swarthy
features
only
now
he
opened
his
lips
for
a
few
brief
words
mon
cher
duc
tell
madame
not
to
waste
the
rare
balm
of
her
pity
the
fellow
you
inquire
for
was
an
outcast
and
an
outlaw
when
he
came
to
us
he
fights
well
it
is
often
a
blackguard
virtue
his
guest
nodded
and
changed
the
subject
his
impatience
and
aversion
at
the
introduction
of
his
sister
name
into
the
discussion
made
him
drop
the
theme
unpursued
and
let
it
die
out
forgotten
venetia
corona
associated
with
an
algerian
trooper
if
cigarette
had
been
of
his
own
sex
he
could
have
dashed
the
white
teeth
down
her
throat
for
having
spoken
of
the
two
in
one
breath
and
as
later
on
he
stretched
his
gallant
limbs
out
on
his
narrow
camp
pallet
tired
with
a
long
day
in
saddle
under
the
hot
african
sun
the
seraph
fell
asleep
with
his
right
arm
under
his
handsome
golden
head
and
thought
no
more
of
this
unknown
french
trooper
but
cigarette
remained
wakeful
she
lay
curled
up
in
the
straw
against
her
pet
horse
etoile
filante
with
her
head
on
the
beast
glossy
flank
and
her
hand
among
his
mane
she
often
slept
thus
in
camp
and
the
horse
would
lie
still
and
cramped
for
hours
rather
than
awaken
her
or
if
he
rose
would
take
the
most
watchful
heed
to
leave
unharmed
the
slender
limbs
the
flushed
cheeks
the
frank
fair
brow
of
the
sleeper
beneath
him
that
one
stroke
of
his
hoof
could
have
stamped
out
into
a
bruised
and
shapeless
mass
etoile
filante
slept
and
his
mistress
was
awake
with
her
eyes
looking
out
into
the
darkness
beyond
with
a
passionate
mist
of
unshed
tears
in
them
and
her
mouth
quivering
with
pain
and
with
wrath
the
vehement
excitation
had
not
died
away
in
her
but
there
had
come
with
it
a
dull
spiritless
aching
depression
it
had
roused
her
to
fury
to
hear
the
reference
to
her
rival
spoken
of
that
aristocrat
whose
name
had
been
on
cecil
lips
when
he
had
been
delirious
she
had
kept
his
secret
loyally
she
had
defended
him
vehemently
there
was
something
that
touched
her
to
the
core
in
the
thought
of
the
love
with
which
he
had
recognized
this
friend
who
in
ignorance
spoke
of
him
as
of
some
unknown
french
soldier
she
could
not
tell
what
the
history
was
but
she
could
divine
nearly
enough
to
feel
its
pathos
and
its
pain
she
had
known
in
her
short
life
more
of
men
and
of
their
passions
and
of
their
fortunes
than
many
lives
of
half
a
century
in
length
can
ever
do
she
could
guess
nearly
enough
to
be
wounded
with
its
sorrow
the
past
which
had
exiled
the
man
who
had
kept
by
him
his
lost
mother
ring
as
the
sole
relic
of
years
to
which
he
was
dead
so
utterly
as
though
he
were
lying
in
his
coffin
no
matter
what
the
precise
reason
was
women
or
debt
or
accident
or
ruin
these
two
who
had
been
familiar
comrades
were
now
as
strangers
to
each
other
the
one
slumbered
in
ignorance
near
her
the
other
had
gone
out
to
the
close
peril
of
death
lest
the
eyes
of
his
friend
recognize
his
face
and
read
his
secret
it
troubled
her
it
weighed
on
her
it
smote
her
with
a
pang
it
might
be
that
now
even
now
this
very
moment
while
her
gaze
watched
the
dusky
shadows
of
the
night
chase
one
another
along
the
dreary
plains
a
shot
might
have
struck
down
this
life
that
had
been
stripped
of
name
and
fame
and
country
even
now
all
might
be
over
and
cigarette
felt
a
cold
sickly
shudder
seize
her
that
never
before
at
death
or
danger
had
chilled
the
warm
swift
current
of
her
bright
french
blood
in
bitter
scorn
at
herself
she
muttered
hot
oaths
between
her
pretty
teeth
mere
de
dieu
he
had
touched
her
lips
as
carelessly
as
her
own
kiss
would
have
touched
the
waxen
petals
of
a
cluster
of
and
she
cared
for
him
still
while
the
seraph
slept
dreamlessly
with
the
tents
of
the
french
camp
around
him
and
the
sleepless
eyes
of
cigarette
watched
afar
off
the
dim
distant
forms
of
the
vedettes
as
they
circled
slowly
round
at
their
outpost
duty
eight
leagues
off
through
a
vast
desert
of
shadow
and
silence
the
two
horsemen
swept
swiftly
on
not
a
word
had
passed
between
them
they
rode
close
together
in
unbroken
stillness
they
were
scarcely
visible
to
each
other
for
there
was
no
moon
and
obscured
the
skies
now
and
then
their
horses
hoofs
struck
fire
from
a
and
the
flash
sparkled
through
the
darkness
often
not
even
the
sound
of
their
gallop
was
audible
on
the
gray
dry
loose
soil
every
rood
of
the
road
was
sown
thick
with
peril
no
frowning
ledge
of
rock
with
in
its
clefts
but
might
serve
as
the
barricade
behind
which
some
foe
lurked
no
knot
of
black
even
on
that
black
sheet
of
shadow
but
might
be
pierced
with
the
steel
tubes
of
leveled
waiting
muskets
pillaging
burning
devastating
wherever
they
could
in
what
was
to
them
a
holy
war
of
resistance
to
the
infidel
and
the
invader
the
predatory
tribes
had
broken
out
into
a
revolt
which
the
rout
of
zaraila
heavy
blow
though
it
had
been
to
them
had
by
no
means
ended
they
were
still
in
arms
infesting
the
country
everywhere
southward
defying
regular
pursuit
impervious
to
regular
attacks
carrying
on
the
harassing
guerilla
warfare
at
which
they
were
such
adepts
and
causing
thus
to
their
frankish
foe
more
irritation
and
more
loss
than
decisive
engagements
would
have
produced
they
feared
nothing
had
nothing
to
lose
and
could
subsist
almost
upon
nothing
they
might
be
driven
into
the
desert
they
might
even
be
exterminated
after
long
pursuit
but
they
would
never
be
vanquished
and
they
were
scattered
now
far
and
wide
over
the
country
every
cave
might
shelter
every
ravine
might
inclose
them
they
appeared
here
they
appeared
there
they
swooped
down
on
a
convoy
they
carried
sword
and
flame
into
a
settlement
they
darted
like
a
flight
of
hawks
upon
a
foraging
party
they
picked
off
any
vedette
as
he
wheeled
his
horse
round
in
the
moonlight
and
every
yard
of
the
sixty
miles
which
the
two
gray
chargers
of
the
chasseurs
must
cover
ere
their
service
was
done
was
as
rife
with
death
as
though
its
course
lay
over
the
volcanic
line
of
an
earthquake
or
a
hollow
mined
and
sprung
they
had
reached
the
center
of
the
plain
when
the
sound
they
had
long
looked
for
rang
on
their
ears
piercing
the
heavy
breathless
stillness
of
the
night
it
was
the
of
their
foes
the
of
the
moslem
out
of
the
gloom
whether
from
long
pursuit
or
some
near
they
could
not
tell
there
broke
suddenly
upon
them
the
fury
of
an
arab
onslaught
in
the
darkness
all
they
could
see
were
the
flash
of
steel
the
flame
of
fierce
eyes
against
their
own
the
white
steam
of
smoking
horses
the
spray
of
froth
flung
off
the
snorting
nostrils
the
rapid
glitter
of
the
curved
flissas
whether
two
or
twenty
or
twice
a
hundred
were
upon
them
they
could
not
know
they
never
did
know
all
of
which
they
were
conscious
was
that
in
an
instant
from
the
tranquil
melancholy
around
them
of
the
great
dim
naked
space
they
were
plunged
into
the
din
the
fury
the
heat
the
close
crushing
horrible
entanglement
of
conflict
without
the
power
to
perceive
or
to
number
their
foes
and
only
able
to
follow
the
sheer
simple
instincts
of
attack
and
of
defense
all
they
were
sensible
of
was
one
of
those
confused
moments
deafening
blinding
filled
with
violence
and
rage
and
din
an
eternity
in
semblance
a
second
in
duration
that
can
never
be
traced
never
be
recalled
yet
in
whose
feverish
excitement
men
do
that
which
in
their
calmer
hours
would
look
to
them
a
fable
of
some
amadis
of
gaul
how
they
were
attacked
how
they
resisted
how
they
struck
how
they
were
encompassed
how
they
thrust
back
those
who
were
hurled
on
them
in
the
black
night
with
the
north
like
ice
upon
their
faces
and
the
loose
african
soil
drifting
up
in
clouds
of
sand
around
them
they
could
never
have
told
nor
how
they
strained
free
from
the
armed
ring
that
circled
them
and
beat
aside
the
shafts
of
lances
and
the
blades
of
swords
and
forced
their
chargers
breast
to
breast
against
the
fence
of
steel
and
through
the
tempest
of
rage
and
blows
and
shouts
and
wind
and
driven
sand
cut
their
way
through
the
foe
whose
very
face
they
scarce
could
see
and
plunged
away
into
the
shadows
across
the
desolation
of
the
plain
pursued
whether
by
one
or
by
the
thousand
they
could
not
guess
for
the
gallop
was
noiseless
on
the
powdered
soil
and
the
arab
yell
of
baffled
passion
and
slaughterous
lust
was
half
drowned
in
the
rising
of
the
had
it
been
day
they
would
have
seen
their
passage
across
the
level
traced
by
a
crimson
stream
upon
the
sand
in
which
the
blood
of
frank
and
arab
blended
equally
as
it
was
they
dashed
headlong
down
through
the
darkness
that
grew
yet
denser
and
blacker
as
the
storm
rose
for
miles
the
ground
was
level
before
them
and
they
had
only
to
let
the
horses
that
had
as
by
a
miracle
escaped
all
injury
rush
on
at
their
own
will
through
the
whirl
of
the
wind
that
drove
the
dust
upward
in
spiral
columns
and
brought
icy
breaths
of
the
north
over
the
sear
sunburned
southern
wastes
for
a
long
space
they
had
no
sense
but
that
of
rapid
ceaseless
motion
through
the
thick
gloom
and
against
the
pressure
of
the
violent
blasts
the
speed
of
their
gallop
and
the
strength
of
the
currents
of
air
were
like
some
narcotic
that
drowned
and
that
dizzied
perception
in
the
intense
darkness
neither
could
see
neither
hear
the
other
the
instinct
of
the
beasts
kept
them
together
but
no
word
could
be
heard
above
the
roar
of
the
storm
and
no
light
broke
the
somber
veil
of
shadow
through
which
they
passed
as
fast
as
leopards
course
through
the
night
the
first
faint
streak
of
dawn
grew
gray
in
the
east
when
cecil
felt
his
charger
stagger
and
sway
beneath
him
and
halt
worn
out
and
quivering
in
every
sinew
with
fatigue
he
threw
himself
off
the
animal
in
time
to
save
himself
from
falling
with
it
as
it
reeled
and
sank
to
the
ground
massena
can
not
stir
another
yard
he
said
do
you
think
they
follow
us
still
there
was
no
reply
he
strained
his
sight
to
pierce
the
darkness
but
he
could
distinguish
nothing
the
gloom
was
still
too
deep
he
spoke
more
loudly
still
there
was
no
reply
then
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
shout
it
rang
through
the
silence
and
when
it
ceased
the
silence
reigned
again
a
deadly
chill
came
on
him
how
had
he
missed
his
comrade
they
must
be
far
apart
he
knew
since
no
response
was
given
to
his
summons
or
the
alternative
rose
before
him
with
a
terrible
foreboding
that
intense
quiet
had
a
repose
as
of
death
in
it
a
ghastly
loneliness
that
seemed
filled
with
desolation
his
horse
was
stretched
before
him
on
the
sand
powerless
to
rise
and
drag
itself
a
rood
onward
and
fast
expiring
from
the
plains
around
him
not
a
sound
came
either
of
friend
or
foe
the
consciousness
that
he
was
alone
that
he
had
lost
forever
the
only
friend
left
to
him
struck
on
him
with
that
conviction
which
so
often
foreruns
the
assurance
of
calamity
without
a
moment
pause
he
plunged
back
in
the
direction
he
had
come
leaving
the
charger
on
the
ground
to
pant
its
life
out
as
it
must
and
sought
to
feel
his
way
along
so
as
to
seek
as
best
he
could
the
companion
he
had
deserted
he
still
could
not
see
a
rood
before
him
but
he
went
on
slowly
with
some
vague
hope
that
he
should
ere
long
reach
the
man
whom
he
knew
death
or
the
fatality
of
accident
alone
would
keep
from
his
side
he
could
not
feel
or
hear
anything
that
gave
him
the
slightest
sign
or
clew
to
aid
his
search
he
only
wandered
farther
from
his
horse
and
risked
falling
afresh
into
the
hands
of
his
pursuers
he
shouted
again
with
all
his
strength
but
his
own
voice
alone
echoed
over
the
plains
while
his
heart
stood
still
with
the
same
frozen
dread
that
a
man
feels
when
wrecked
on
some
barren
shore
his
cry
for
rescue
rings
back
on
his
own
ear
over
the
waste
of
waters
the
flicker
of
the
dawn
was
growing
lighter
in
the
sky
and
he
could
see
dimly
now
as
in
some
winter
day
dark
twilight
though
all
around
him
hung
the
leaden
mist
with
the
wild
winds
driving
furiously
it
was
with
difficulty
also
that
he
kept
his
feet
against
their
force
but
he
was
blown
onward
by
their
current
though
beaten
from
side
to
side
and
he
still
made
his
way
forward
he
had
repassed
the
ground
already
traversed
by
some
hundred
yards
or
more
which
seemed
the
length
of
many
miles
in
the
hurricane
that
was
driving
over
the
earth
and
sky
when
some
outline
still
duskier
than
the
dusky
shadow
caught
his
sight
it
was
the
body
of
a
horse
standing
on
guard
over
the
fallen
body
of
a
man
another
moment
and
he
was
beside
them
my
god
are
you
hurt
he
could
see
nothing
but
an
indistinct
and
shapeless
mass
without
form
or
color
to
mark
it
out
from
the
brooding
gloom
and
from
the
leaden
earth
but
the
voice
he
knew
so
well
answered
him
with
the
old
love
and
fealty
in
it
eager
with
fear
for
him
when
did
you
miss
me
sir
i
did
mean
you
to
know
i
held
on
as
long
as
i
could
and
when
i
could
no
longer
i
thought
you
was
safe
not
to
see
i
knocked
over
so
dark
as
it
great
heavens
you
are
hurt
then
just
finished
sir
lord
it
do
matter
only
you
ride
on
cecil
ride
on
i
say
do
mind
what
is
it
when
were
you
struck
o
heaven
i
never
dreamt
cecil
hung
over
him
striving
in
vain
through
the
shadows
to
read
the
truth
from
the
face
on
which
he
felt
by
instinct
the
seal
of
death
was
set
i
never
meant
you
should
know
sir
i
meant
just
to
drop
behind
and
die
on
the
quiet
you
see
sir
it
was
just
this
way
they
hit
me
as
we
forced
through
them
there
the
in
my
loins
now
i
pressed
it
in
hard
and
kept
the
blood
from
flowing
and
thought
i
should
hold
out
so
till
the
sun
rose
but
i
could
do
it
so
long
i
got
sick
and
faint
after
a
while
and
i
knew
well
enough
it
was
death
so
i
dropped
down
while
i
sense
left
to
check
the
horse
and
get
out
of
saddle
in
silence
i
hoped
you
would
miss
me
in
the
darkness
and
the
noise
the
wind
was
making
and
you
did
hear
me
then
sir
i
was
his
voice
was
checked
in
a
quick
gasping
breath
his
only
thought
had
been
to
lie
down
and
die
in
the
solitude
so
that
his
master
might
be
saved
a
great
sob
shook
cecil
as
he
heard
no
false
hope
came
to
him
he
felt
that
this
man
was
lost
to
him
forever
that
this
was
the
sole
recompense
which
the
cruelty
of
africa
would
give
to
a
fidelity
passing
the
fidelity
of
woman
these
throes
of
dissolution
the
only
payment
with
which
fate
would
ever
requite
a
loyalty
that
had
held
no
travail
weary
no
exile
pain
and
no
danger
worthy
counting
so
long
as
they
were
encountered
and
endured
in
his
own
service
do
take
on
about
it
sir
whispered
rake
striving
to
raise
his
head
that
he
might
strain
his
eyes
better
through
the
gloom
to
see
his
master
face
it
was
sure
to
come
some
time
and
i
ai
in
no
pain
to
speak
of
do
leave
me
cecil
leave
me
for
god
sake
and
save
yourself
did
you
leave
me
the
answer
was
very
low
and
his
voice
shook
as
he
uttered
it
but
through
the
roar
of
the
hurricane
rake
heard
it
that
was
different
sir
he
said
simply
let
me
lie
here
and
go
you
on
it
soon
be
over
and
there
naught
to
be
o
god
is
no
help
possible
do
take
on
sir
it
no
odds
i
always
was
a
scamp
and
scamps
die
game
you
know
my
life
been
a
rare
spree
count
it
all
and
all
and
it
a
great
good
thing
you
see
sir
to
go
off
quick
like
this
i
might
have
been
laid
in
hospital
if
you
only
take
the
beast
and
ride
on
sir
hush
hush
would
you
make
me
coward
or
brute
or
both
the
words
broke
in
an
agony
from
him
the
time
had
been
when
he
had
been
himself
stretched
in
what
he
had
thought
was
death
in
just
such
silence
in
just
such
solitude
upon
the
bare
baked
earth
far
from
men
aid
and
near
only
to
the
hungry
eyes
of
watching
beasts
of
prey
then
he
had
been
very
calm
and
waited
with
indifference
for
the
end
now
his
eyes
swept
over
the
remorseless
wastes
that
were
growing
faintly
visible
under
the
coming
dawn
with
all
the
impatience
the
terror
of
despair
death
had
smitten
down
many
beside
him
buoyant
youth
and
dauntless
manhood
he
had
seen
a
thousand
times
swept
under
the
great
waves
of
war
and
lost
forever
but
it
had
an
anguish
for
him
here
that
he
would
never
have
known
had
he
felt
his
own
well
out
over
the
sand
the
whole
existence
of
this
man
had
been
sacrificed
for
him
and
its
only
reward
was
a
thrust
of
a
lance
in
a
midnight
fray
a
grave
in
an
alien
soil
his
grief
fell
dully
on
ears
half
deafened
already
to
the
sounds
of
the
living
world
the
exhaustion
that
follows
on
great
loss
of
blood
was
upon
the
soldier
who
for
the
last
half
hour
had
lain
there
in
the
darkness
and
the
stillness
quietly
waiting
death
and
not
once
seeking
even
to
raise
his
voice
for
succor
lest
the
cry
should
reach
and
should
imperil
his
master
the
morning
had
broken
now
but
the
storm
had
not
lulled
the
northern
winds
were
sweeping
over
the
plains
in
tenfold
violence
and
the
rains
burst
and
poured
with
the
fury
of
on
the
crust
of
the
parched
cracked
earth
around
them
there
was
nothing
heard
or
seen
except
the
leaden
angry
mists
tossed
to
and
fro
under
the
hurricane
and
the
white
light
of
the
coming
day
breaking
lividly
through
the
clouds
the
world
held
no
place
of
more
utter
desolation
more
unspeakable
loneliness
and
in
its
misery
cecil
flung
down
upon
the
sands
beside
him
could
do
nothing
except
helpless
to
aid
and
powerless
to
save
watch
the
last
breath
grow
feebler
and
feebler
until
it
faded
out
from
the
only
life
that
had
been
faithful
to
him
by
the
fitful
gleams
of
day
he
could
see
the
blood
slowly
ebbing
out
from
the
great
gap
where
the
was
still
bedded
with
its
wooden
shaft
snapped
in
two
he
could
see
the
drooped
head
that
he
had
raised
upon
his
knee
with
the
yellow
northern
curls
that
no
desert
suns
had
darkened
and
rake
eyes
smiling
so
brightly
and
so
bravely
still
looked
up
from
under
their
weary
lids
to
his
i
never
let
you
take
my
hand
before
sir
just
take
it
once
now
will
you
while
i
can
see
you
their
hands
met
as
he
asked
it
and
held
each
other
close
and
long
all
the
loyal
service
of
the
one
life
and
all
the
speechless
gratitude
of
the
other
told
better
than
by
all
words
in
that
one
farewell
a
light
that
was
not
from
the
stormy
dusky
morning
shone
over
the
soldier
face
time
was
sir
he
said
with
a
smile
when
i
need
to
think
as
how
some
day
or
another
when
i
should
have
done
something
great
and
grand
and
you
was
back
among
your
own
again
and
they
here
had
given
me
the
cross
i
have
asked
you
to
have
done
that
before
all
the
army
and
just
to
have
said
to
if
so
you
liked
was
a
scamp
and
he
was
thought
good
for
naught
but
he
kept
true
to
me
and
you
see
it
made
him
go
straight
and
i
are
ashamed
to
call
him
my
friend
i
used
to
think
that
sir
though
was
silly
perhaps
but
it
best
as
it
is
a
deal
best
no
doubt
if
you
was
only
back
safe
in
camp
o
god
cease
i
am
not
worthy
one
thought
of
love
like
yes
you
are
sir
leastways
you
was
to
me
when
you
took
pity
on
me
it
was
just
a
if
i
did
go
right
to
the
gallows
do
grieve
that
way
cecil
if
i
could
just
have
seen
you
home
again
in
your
place
i
should
have
been
glad
that
all
you
go
back
one
day
sir
when
you
do
tell
the
king
i
ai
never
forgot
his
voice
grew
faint
as
the
last
sentence
stole
from
his
lips
he
lay
quite
still
his
head
leaned
back
against
his
master
and
the
day
came
with
the
north
winds
driving
over
the
plains
and
the
gray
mists
tossed
by
them
to
and
fro
like
smoke
there
was
a
long
silence
a
pause
in
which
the
windstorm
ceased
and
the
clouds
of
the
loosed
sands
sunk
alone
with
the
wastes
stretching
around
them
were
the
living
and
the
dying
man
with
the
horse
standing
motionless
beside
them
and
above
the
gloom
of
the
sullen
sky
no
aid
was
possible
they
could
but
wait
in
the
stupefaction
of
despair
for
the
end
of
all
to
come
in
that
awful
stillness
in
that
sudden
lull
in
the
madness
of
the
hurricane
death
had
a
horror
which
it
never
wore
in
the
riot
of
the
battlefield
in
the
intoxication
of
the
slaughter
there
was
no
pity
in
earth
or
heaven
the
hard
hot
ground
sucked
down
its
fill
of
blood
the
icy
air
enwrapped
them
like
a
shroud
the
faithfulness
of
love
the
strength
of
gratitude
were
of
no
avail
the
one
perished
in
agony
the
other
was
powerless
to
save
in
that
momentary
hush
as
the
winds
sank
low
the
heavy
eyes
half
sightless
now
sought
with
their
old
wistful
doglike
loyalty
the
face
to
which
so
soon
they
would
be
blind
forever
would
you
tell
me
once
sir
now
i
never
asked
i
never
would
have
done
but
may
be
i
might
know
in
this
last
minute
you
never
sinned
that
sin
you
bear
the
charge
on
god
is
my
witness
the
light
that
was
like
sunlight
shone
once
more
in
the
aching
wandering
eyes
i
knew
i
knew
it
was
cecil
bowed
his
head
over
him
lower
and
lower
hush
he
was
but
a
child
and
i
with
a
sudden
and
swift
motion
as
though
new
life
were
thrilling
in
him
rake
raised
himself
erect
his
arms
stretched
outward
to
the
east
where
the
young
day
was
breaking
i
knew
i
knew
i
never
doubted
you
will
go
back
to
your
own
some
day
and
men
shall
learn
the
truth
thank
god
thank
god
then
with
that
light
still
on
his
face
his
head
fell
backward
and
with
one
quick
brief
sigh
his
life
fled
out
forever
the
time
passed
on
the
storm
had
risen
afresh
the
violence
of
the
gusts
blew
yellow
sheets
of
sand
whirling
over
the
plains
alone
with
the
dead
one
across
his
knees
cecil
sat
motionless
as
though
turned
to
stone
his
eyes
were
dry
and
fixed
but
ever
and
again
a
great
tearless
sob
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
the
only
life
that
linked
him
with
the
past
the
only
love
that
had
suffered
all
things
for
his
sake
were
gone
crushed
out
as
though
they
never
had
been
like
some
insect
trodden
in
the
soil
he
had
lost
all
consciousness
all
memory
save
of
that
lifeless
thing
which
lay
across
his
knees
like
a
felled
tree
like
a
broken
log
with
the
glimmer
of
the
tempestuous
day
so
chill
and
white
upon
the
upturned
face
he
was
alone
on
earth
and
the
solitudes
around
him
were
not
more
desolate
than
his
own
fate
he
was
like
a
man
numbed
and
stupefied
by
intense
cold
his
veins
seemed
stagnant
and
his
sight
could
only
see
those
features
that
became
so
terribly
serene
so
fearfully
unmoved
with
the
dread
calm
of
death
yet
the
old
mechanical
instincts
of
a
soldier
guided
him
still
he
vaguely
knew
that
his
errand
had
to
be
done
must
be
done
let
his
heart
ache
as
it
would
let
him
long
as
he
might
to
lie
down
by
the
side
of
his
only
friend
and
leave
the
torture
of
life
to
grow
still
in
him
also
for
evermore
instinctively
he
moved
to
carry
out
the
duty
trusted
to
him
he
looked
east
and
west
north
and
south
there
was
nothing
in
sight
that
could
bring
him
aid
there
were
only
the
dust
clouds
hurled
in
billows
hither
and
thither
by
the
bitter
winds
still
blowing
from
the
sea
all
that
could
be
done
had
to
be
done
by
himself
alone
his
own
safety
hung
on
the
swiftness
of
his
flight
for
aught
he
knew
at
every
moment
out
of
the
mist
and
the
driven
sheets
of
sand
there
might
rush
the
desert
horses
of
his
foes
but
this
memory
was
not
with
him
all
he
thought
of
was
that
burden
stretched
across
his
limbs
which
laid
down
one
hour
here
unwatched
would
be
the
prey
of
the
jackal
and
the
vulture
he
raised
it
reverently
in
his
arms
and
with
long
laborious
effort
drew
its
weight
up
across
the
saddle
of
the
charger
which
stood
patiently
waiting
by
turning
its
docile
eyes
with
a
plaintive
wondering
sadness
on
the
body
of
the
rider
it
had
loved
then
he
mounted
himself
and
with
the
head
of
his
lost
comrade
borne
up
upon
his
arm
and
rested
gently
on
his
breast
he
rode
westward
over
the
great
plain
to
where
his
mission
lay
the
horse
paced
slowly
beneath
the
double
load
of
dead
and
living
he
would
not
urge
the
creature
faster
on
every
movement
that
shook
the
drooping
limbs
or
jarred
the
repose
of
that
last
sleep
seemed
desecration
he
passed
the
place
where
his
own
horse
was
stretched
the
vultures
were
already
there
he
shuddered
and
then
pressed
faster
on
as
though
the
beasts
and
birds
of
prey
would
rob
him
of
his
burden
ere
he
could
give
it
sanctuary
and
so
he
rode
mile
after
mile
over
the
barren
land
with
no
companion
save
the
dead
the
winds
blew
fiercely
in
his
teeth
the
sand
was
in
his
eyes
and
hair
the
way
was
long
and
weary
and
sown
thick
with
danger
but
he
knew
of
nothing
felt
and
saw
nothing
save
that
one
familiar
face
so
strangely
changed
and
transfigured
by
that
glory
with
which
death
had
touched
it
chapter
xxxi

thus
burdened
he
made
his
way
for
over
two
leagues
the
hurricane
never
abated
and
the
blinding
dust
rose
around
him
in
great
waves
the
horse
fell
lame
he
had
to
dismount
and
move
slowly
and
painfully
over
the
loose
heavy
soil
on
foot
raising
the
drooping
head
of
the
lifeless
rider
it
was
bitter
weary
cruel
travail
of
an
intolerable
labor
of
an
intolerable
pain
once
or
twice
he
grew
sick
and
giddy
and
lost
for
a
moment
all
consciousness
but
he
pressed
onward
resolute
not
to
yield
and
leave
the
vultures
hovering
aloft
their
prey
he
was
still
somewhat
weakened
by
the
wounds
of
zaraila
he
had
been
bruised
and
exhausted
by
the
skirmish
of
the
past
night
he
was
weary
and
but
he
did
not
yield
to
his
longing
to
sink
down
on
the
sands
and
let
his
life
ebb
out
he
held
patiently
onward
through
the
infinite
misery
of
the
passage
at
last
he
drew
near
the
caravanserai
where
he
had
been
directed
to
obtain
a
change
of
horses
it
stood
midway
in
the
distance
that
he
had
to
traverse
and
almost
alone
when
the
face
of
the
country
changed
and
was
more
full
of
color
and
more
broken
into
rocky
and
irregular
surfaces
as
a
man
walks
in
a
dream
he
led
the
sinking
beast
toward
its
shelter
as
its
irregular
corner
towers
became
dimly
perceptible
to
him
through
the
dizzy
mists
that
had
obscured
his
sight
by
sheer
instinct
he
found
his
route
straight
toward
the
open
arch
of
its
and
into
the
square
courtyard
thronged
with
mules
and
camels
and
horses
for
the
caravanserai
stood
on
the
only
road
that
led
through
that
district
to
the
south
and
was
the
only
house
of
call
for
drovers
or
shelter
for
travelers
and
artists
of
europe
who
might
pass
that
way
the
groups
in
the
court
paused
in
their
converse
and
in
their
occupations
and
looked
in
awe
at
the
gray
charger
with
its
strange
burden
and
the
french
chasseur
who
came
so
blindly
forward
like
a
man
feeling
his
passage
through
the
dark
there
was
something
in
the
sight
that
had
a
vague
terror
for
them
before
they
clearly
saw
what
this
thing
was
which
was
thus
brought
into
their
presence
cecil
moved
slowly
on
into
their
midst
his
hand
on
the
horse
rein
then
a
great
darkness
covered
his
sight
he
swayed
to
and
fro
and
fell
senseless
on
the
gray
stone
of
the
paved
court
while
the
muleteer
and
the
the
kabyls
and
the
french
who
were
mingled
there
crowded
around
him
in
fear
and
in
wonder
when
consciousness
returned
to
him
he
was
lying
on
a
stone
bench
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
and
a
throng
of
lean
bronzed
eager
faces
about
him
in
the
midday
sunlight
which
had
broken
through
the
windstorm
instantly
he
remembered
all
where
is
he
he
asked
they
knew
he
meant
the
dead
man
and
answered
him
in
a
hushed
murmur
of
many
voices
they
had
placed
the
body
gently
down
within
in
a
darkened
chamber
a
shiver
passed
over
him
he
stretched
his
hand
out
for
water
that
they
held
to
him
saddle
me
a
fresh
horse
i
have
my
work
to
he
knew
that
for
no
friendship
or
grief
or
suffering
or
might
a
soldier
pause
by
the
wayside
while
his
errand
was
still
undone
his
duty
unfulfilled
he
drank
the
water
thirstily
then
reeling
slightly
still
from
the
weakness
that
was
still
upon
him
he
rose
rejecting
their
offers
of
aid
take
me
to
him
he
said
simply
they
understood
him
there
were
french
soldiers
among
them
and
they
took
him
without
question
or
comment
across
the
court
to
the
little
square
stone
cell
within
one
of
the
towers
where
they
had
laid
the
corpse
with
nothing
to
break
the
quiet
and
the
solitude
except
the
low
soft
cooing
of
some
doves
that
had
their
homes
in
its
dark
corners
and
flew
in
and
out
at
pleasure
through
the
oval
aperture
that
served
as
window
he
motioned
them
all
back
with
his
hand
and
went
into
the
gloom
of
the
chamber
alone
not
one
among
them
followed
when
he
came
forth
again
the
reckless
and
riotous
soldiers
of
france
turned
silently
and
reverentially
away
so
that
they
should
not
look
upon
his
face
for
it
was
well
known
throughout
the
army
that
no
common
tie
had
bound
together
the
exiles
of
england
and
the
fealty
of
comrade
to
comrade
was
sacred
in
their
sight
the
fresh
animal
saddled
was
held
ready
outside
the
gates
he
crossed
the
court
moving
still
like
a
man
without
sense
of
what
he
did
he
had
the
instinct
to
carry
out
the
mission
trusted
to
him
instantly
and
accurately
but
he
had
no
distinct
perception
or
memory
of
aught
else
save
of
those
features
of
which
ere
he
could
return
the
cruel
sun
of
africa
would
not
have
spared
one
trace
he
passed
under
the
shadow
of
the
gateway
arch
a
shadow
black
and
intense
against
the
golden
light
which
with
the
ceasing
of
the
storm
flooded
the
land
in
the
full
morning
there
were
movement
noise
changes
haste
in
the
entrance
besides
the
arrival
of
the
detachment
of
the
line
and
a
string
of
camels
the
retinue
of
some
travelers
of
rank
was
preparing
for
departure
and
the
resources
of
the
humble
caravanserai
were
taxed
beyond
their
powers
the
name
that
some
of
the
hurrying
grooms
shouted
loudly
in
their
impatience
broke
through
his
stupor
and
reached
him
it
was
that
of
the
woman
whom
however
madly
he
loved
with
all
the
strength
of
a
passion
born
out
of
utter
hopelessness
he
turned
to
the
outrider
nearest
him
you
are

what
does

madame

this

travels
with
le

her
brother
milady
does
not
know
what
fear
but
the
remonstrance
died
on
his
lips
he
stood
gazing
out
from
the
gloom
of
the
arch
at
a
face
close
to
him
on
which
the
sun
shone
full
a
face
unseen
for
twelve
long
years
and
which
a
moment
before
laughing
and
careless
in
the
light
changed
and
grew
set
and
rigid
and
pale
with
the
pallor
of
an
unutterable
horror
his
own
flushed
and
moved
and
altered
with
a
wholly
different
emotion
emotion
that
was
above
all
of
an
intense
and
yearning
tenderness
for
a
moment
both
stood
motionless
and
speechless
then
with
a
marvelous
and
cecil
brought
his
hand
to
his
brow
in
military
salute
passed
with
the
impassiveness
of
a
soldier
who
passed
a
gentleman
reached
his
charger
and
rode
away
upon
his
errand
over
the
brown
and
level
ground
he
had
known
his
brother
in
that
fleeting
glance
but
he
hoped
that
his
brother
would
see
no
more
in
him
than
a
french
trooper
who
bore
resemblance
by
a
strange
hazard
to
one
long
believed
to
be
dead
and
gone
the
instinct
of
generosity
the
instinct
of
moved
him
now
as
long
ago
one
fatal
night
they
had
moved
him
to
bear
the
sin
of
his
mother
darling
as
his
own
full
remembrance
full
consideration
of
what
he
had
done
never
came
to
him
as
he
dashed
on
across
the
many
leagues
that
still
lay
between
him
and
his
goal
his
one
impulse
had
been
to
spare
the
other
from
the
knowledge
that
he
lived
his
one
longing
was
to
have
the
hardness
and
the
bitterness
of
his
own
life
buried
in
the
oblivion
of
a
grave
within
hours
the
instructions
he
bore
were
in
the
tent
of
the
chef
du
bataillon
whom
they
were
to
direct
and
he
himself
returned
to
the
caravanserai
to
fulfill
with
his
own
hand
to
the
dead
those
last
offices
which
he
would
delegate
to
none
it
was
night
when
he
arrived
all
was
still
and
deserted
he
inquired
if
the
party
of
tourists
was
gone
they
answered
him
in
the
affirmative
there
only
remained
the
detachment
of
the
french
infantry
which
were
billeted
there
for
a
while
it
was
in
the
coolness
and
the
hush
of
the
night
with
the
great
stars
shining
clearly
over
the
darkness
of
the
plains
that
they
made
the
single
grave
under
a
leaning
shelf
of
rock
with
the
somber
fans
of
a
pine
spread
above
it
and
nothing
near
but
the
sleeping
herds
of
goats
the
sullen
echo
of
the
soldiers
muskets
gave
its
only
funeral
requiem
and
the
young
lambs
and
kids
in
many
a
future
would
come
and
play
and
browse
and
stretch
their
little
tired
limbs
upon
its
sod
its
sole
watchers
in
the
desolation
of
the
plains
when
all
was
over
and
the
startled
flocks
had
settled
once
again
to
rest
and
slumber
cecil
still
remained
there
alone
thrown
down
upon
the
grave
he
never
moved
as
hour
after
hour
went
by
to
others
that
lonely
and
unnoticed
tomb
would
be
as
nothing
only
one
among
the
thousand
marks
left
on
the
bosom
of
the
violated
earth
by
the
ravenous
and
savage
lusts
of
war
but
to
him
it
held
all
that
had
bound
him
to
his
lost
youth
his
lost
country
his
lost
peace
all
that
had
remained
of
the
years
that
were
gone
and
were
now
as
a
dream
of
the
night
this
man
had
followed
him
cleaved
to
him
endured
misery
and
rejected
honor
for
his
sake
and
all
the
recompense
such
a
life
received
was
to
be
stilled
forever
by
a
of
an
unknown
foe
unthanked
undistinguished
unavenged
it
seemed
to
him
like
murder
murder
with
which
his
own
hand
was
stained
the
slow
night
hours
passed
in
the
stillness
that
had
succeeded
to
the
storm
of
the
past
day
there
was
not
a
sound
except
the
bleating
of
the
young
goats
straying
from
the
herd
he
lay
prostrate
under
the
black
lengths
of
the
pine
the
exhaustion
of
great
fatigue
was
on
him
a
grief
acute
as
remorse
consumed
him
for
the
man
who
following
his
fate
had
only
found
at
the
end
a
nameless
and
lonely
grave
in
the
land
of
his
exile
he
started
with
a
thrill
of
almost
superstitious
fear
as
through
the
silence
he
heard
a
name
whispered
the
name
of
his
childhood
of
his
past
he
sprang
to
this
feet
and
as
he
turned
in
the
moonlight
he
saw
once
more
his
brother
face
pale
as
the
face
of
the
dead
and
strained
with
an
agonizing
dread
concealment
was
no
longer
possible
the
younger
man
knew
that
the
elder
lived
knew
it
by
a
strange
and
irresistible
certainty
that
needed
no
proof
that
left
no
place
for
hope
or
fear
in
its
chill
leaden
merciless
conviction
for
some
moments
neither
spoke
a
flood
of
innumerable
memories
choked
thought
or
word
in
both
they
knew
each
other
all
was
said
in
that
cecil
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
he
moved
nearer
with
a
rapid
movement
and
his
hand
fell
heavily
on
the
other
shoulder
have
you
lived
stainlessly
since
the
question
was
stern
as
the
demand
of
a
judge
his
brother
shuddered
beneath
this
touch
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
god
is
my
witness
yes
but
you
you
they
said
that
you
were
dead
cecil
hand
fell
from
his
shoulder
there
was
that
in
the
words
which
smote
him
more
cruelly
than
any
arab
steel
could
have
done
there
was
the
accent
of
regret
i
am
dead
he
said
simply
dead
to
the
world
and
he
who
bore
the
title
of
royallieu
covered
his
face
how
have
you
lived
he
whispered
hoarsely
honorably
let
that
suffice
and
you
the
other
looked
up
at
him
with
a
piteous
appeal
the
old
timorous
terrified
appeal
that
had
been
so
often
seen
on
the
boy
face
strangely
returning
on
the
gracious
and
mature
beauty
of
the
man
in
honor
too
i
swear
that
was
my
first
disgrace
and
my
last
you
bore
the
weight
of
my
shame
good
god
what
can
i
say
such
nobility
such
sacrifice
he
would
have
said
enough
more
than
enough
to
satisfy
the
one
who
had
lost
all
for
his
sake
had
there
but
been
once
in
his
voice
no
fear
but
only
love
as
it
was
that
which
he
still
thought
of
was
himself
alone
while
crushed
with
the
weight
of
his
brother
surpassing
generosity
he
still
was
filled
with
only
one
thought
that
burned
through
the
darkness
of
his
bewildered
horror
and
that
thought
was
his
own
jeopardy
even
in
the
very
first
hours
of
his
knowledge
that
the
man
whom
he
had
believed
dead
was
living
living
and
bearing
the
burden
of
the
guilt
he
should
have
borne
what
he
was
filled
with
was
the
imminence
of
his
own
peril
cecil
stood
in
silence
looking
at
him
he
saw
the
boyish
loveliness
he
remembered
so
well
altered
into
the
stronger
and
fuller
beauty
of
the
man
he
saw
that
life
had
gone
softly
smoothly
joyously
with
this
weak
and
feminine
nature
and
that
in
the
absence
of
temptation
to
evil
its
career
had
been
fair
and
straight
in
the
sight
of
the
world
he
saw
that
his
brother
had
been
in
one
word
happy
he
saw
that
happiness
had
done
for
this
character
what
adversity
had
done
for
his
own
he
saw
that
by
it
had
been
saved
a
temperament
that
calamity
would
have
wrecked
he
stood
and
looked
at
him
but
he
spoke
not
one
word
whatever
he
felt
he
restrained
from
all
expression
the
younger
man
still
hid
his
face
upon
his
hands
as
if
even
in
those
pale
gray
moonbeams
he
shunned
the
light
that
was
about
him
we
believed
you
were
dead
he
murmured
wildly
they
said
so
there
seemed
every
proof
but
when
i
saw
you
yesterday
i
knew
you
i
knew
you
though
you
passed
me
as
a
stranger
i
stayed
on
here
they
told
me
you
would
return
god
what
agony
this
day
and
night
have
been
cecil
was
silent
still
he
knew
that
this
agony
had
been
the
dread
lest
he
should
be
living
there
were
many
emotions
at
war
in
him
scorn
and
pity
and
wounded
love
and
pride
too
proud
to
sue
for
a
gratitude
denied
or
quote
a
sacrifice
that
was
almost
without
parallel
in
generosity
all
held
him
speechless
to
overwhelm
the
sinner
before
him
with
reproaches
to
count
and
claim
the
immeasurable
debts
due
to
him
to
upbraid
and
to
revile
the
wretched
weakness
that
had
left
the
soil
of
a
guilt
not
his
own
to
rest
upon
him
to
do
aught
of
this
was
not
in
him
long
ago
he
had
accepted
the
weight
of
an
alien
crime
and
borne
it
as
his
own
to
undo
now
all
that
he
had
done
in
the
past
to
fling
out
to
ruin
now
the
one
whom
he
had
saved
at
such
a
cost
to
turn
after
twelve
years
and
forsake
the
man
all
coward
though
he
was
whom
he
had
shielded
for
so
long
this
was
not
possible
to
him
though
it
would
be
but
his
own
birthright
that
he
would
demand
his
own
justification
that
he
would
establish
it
would
have
seemed
to
him
like
a
treacherous
and
craven
thing
no
matter
that
the
one
for
whom
the
sacrifice
had
been
made
was
unworthy
of
it
he
held
that
every
law
of
honor
and
justice
forbade
him
now
to
abandon
his
brother
and
yield
him
up
to
the
retribution
of
his
early
fault
it
might
have
been
a
folly
in
the
first
instance
it
might
even
have
been
a
madness
that
choice
of
standing
in
his
brother
place
to
receive
the
shame
of
his
brother
action
but
it
had
been
done
so
long
before
done
on
the
spur
of
generous
affection
and
actuated
by
the
strange
hazard
that
made
the
keeping
of
a
woman
secret
demand
the
same
reticence
which
also
saved
the
young
lad
name
to
draw
back
from
it
now
would
have
been
a
cowardice
impossible
to
his
nature
all
seemed
uttered
without
words
by
their
gaze
at
one
another
he
could
not
speak
with
tenderness
to
this
craven
who
had
been
false
to
the
fair
repute
of
their
name
and
he
would
not
speak
with
harshness
he
felt
too
sick
at
heart
too
weary
too
filled
with
pain
to
ask
aught
of
his
brother
life
it
had
been
saved
from
temptation
and
therefore
saved
from
evil
that
knowledge
sufficed
to
him
the
younger
man
stood
half
stupefied
half
maddened
in
the
many
years
that
had
passed
by
although
his
character
had
not
changed
his
position
had
altered
greatly
and
in
the
last
few
months
he
had
enjoyed
all
the
power
that
wealth
and
independence
and
the
accession
to
his
title
could
bestow
he
felt
some
dull
hot
angered
sense
of
wrong
done
to
him
by
the
fact
that
the
rightful
heir
of
them
still
lived
some
chafing
ingrate
and
unreasoning
impatience
with
the
savior
of
his
whole
existence
some
bitter
pangs
of
conscience
that
he
would
be
baser
yet
base
beyond
all
baseness
to
remain
in
his
elder
place
and
accept
this
sacrifice
still
while
knowing
now
the
truth
bertie
bertie
he
stammered
in
hurried
appeal
and
the
name
of
his
youth
touched
the
hearer
of
it
strangely
making
him
for
the
moment
forget
all
save
that
he
looked
once
more
upon
one
of
his
own
race
on
my
soul
i
never
doubted
that
the
story
of
your
death
was
true
no
one
did
all
the
world
believed
it
if
i
had
known
you
lived
i
would
have
said
that
you
were
innocent
i
would
i
would
have
told
them
how
i
forged
your
friend
name
and
your
own
when
i
was
so
desperate
that
i
scarce
knew
what
i
did
but
they
said
that
you
were
killed
and
i
thought
then
then
it
was
not
worth
while
it
would
have
broken
my
father
heart
god
help
me
i
was
a
coward
he
spoke
the
truth
he
was
a
coward
he
had
ever
been
one
herein
lay
the
whole
story
of
his
fall
his
weakness
his
sin
and
his
ingratitude
cecil
knew
that
never
will
gratitude
exist
where
craven
selfishness
holds
reign
yet
there
was
an
infinite
pity
mingled
with
the
scorn
that
moved
him
after
the
years
of
bitter
endurance
he
had
passed
the
heroic
endurance
he
had
witnessed
the
hard
and
unending
miseries
that
he
had
learned
to
take
as
his
daily
portion
this
feebleness
and
fear
roused
his
wondering
compassion
almost
as
a
woman
weakness
would
have
done
still
he
never
answered
the
hatred
of
the
stain
that
had
been
brought
upon
their
name
by
his
brother
deed
stain
none
the
less
dark
in
his
sight
because
hidden
from
the
world
his
revulsion
from
this
man
who
was
the
only
creature
of
their
race
who
ever
had
turned
poltroon
the
thousand
remembrances
of
childhood
that
uprose
before
him
the
irresistible
yearning
for
some
word
from
the
other
lips
that
should
tell
of
some
lingering
trace
in
him
of
the
old
love
strong
enough
to
kill
for
the
moment
at
least
the
selfish
horror
of
personal
peril
all
these
kept
him
silent
his
brother
misinterpreted
that
silence
i
am
in
your
power
utterly
in
your
power
he
moaned
in
his
fear
i
stand
in
your
place
i
bear
your
title
you
know
that
our
father
and
our
brother
are
dead
all
i
have
inherited
is
yours
do
you
know
that
since
you
have
never
claimed
it
i
know
and
you
have
never
come
forward
to
take
your
rights
what
i
did
not
do
to
clear
my
own
honor
i
was
not
likely
to
do
merely
to
hold
a
the
meaning
of
his
answer
drifted
beyond
the
ear
on
which
his
words
fell
it
was
too
high
to
be
comprehended
by
the
lower
nature
the
man
who
lived
in
prosperity
and
peace
and
in
the
smile
of
the
world
and
the
purple
of
power
looked
bewildered
at
the
man
who
led
the
simple
necessitous
perilous
existence
of
an
soldier
but
great
heaven
this
life
of
yours
it
must
be
wretchedness
perhaps
it
has
at
least
no
disgrace
in
the
reply
had
the
only
sternness
of
contempt
that
he
had
suffered
himself
to
show
it
stung
down
to
his
listener
soul
no
no
he
murmured
you
are
happier
than
i
you
have
no
remorse
to
bear
and
yet
to
tell
the
world
that
i
am
guilty
you
need
never
tell
it
i
shall
he
spoke
quite
quietly
quite
patiently
yet
he
well
knew
and
had
well
weighed
all
he
surrendered
in
that
promise
the
promise
to
condemn
himself
to
a
barren
and
hopeless
fate
forever
you
will
not
the
question
died
almost
inaudible
on
his
dry
parched
tongue
the
one
passion
of
fear
upon
him
was
for
himself
even
in
that
moment
of
supplication
his
disordered
thoughts
hovered
wildly
over
the
chances
of
whether
if
his
elder
brother
even
now
asserted
his
innocence
and
claimed
his
birthright
the
world
and
its
judges
would
ever
believe
him
cecil
for
a
while
again
was
silent
standing
there
by
the
newly
made
grave
of
the
soldier
who
had
been
faithful
as
those
of
his
own
race
and
of
his
own
order
never
had
been
his
heart
was
full
the
ingratitude
and
the
of
this
life
for
which
his
own
had
been
destroyed
smote
him
with
a
fearful
suffering
and
only
a
few
hours
before
he
had
looked
once
more
on
the
face
of
the
beloved
friend
of
his
youth
a
deadlier
sacrifice
than
to
lay
down
wealth
and
name
and
heritage
and
the
world
love
was
to
live
on
leaving
that
one
comrade
of
his
early
days
to
believe
him
dead
after
a
deed
of
shame
his
brother
sank
down
on
the
mound
of
freshly
flung
earth
sinking
his
head
upon
his
arms
with
a
low
moan
time
had
not
changed
him
greatly
it
had
merely
made
him
more
intensely
desirous
of
the
pleasures
and
the
powers
of
life
more
intensely
abhorrent
of
pain
of
censure
of
the
contempt
of
the
world
as
to
escape
these
in
his
boyhood
he
had
stooped
to
any
degradation
so
to
escape
them
in
his
manhood
he
was
capable
of
descending
to
any
falsehood
or
any
weakness
his
was
one
of
those
natures
which
having
no
love
of
evil
for
evil
sake
still
embrace
any
form
of
evil
which
may
save
them
from
the
penalty
of
their
own
weakness
now
thus
meeting
one
who
for
twelve
years
he
had
believed
must
rise
from
the
tomb
itself
to
reproach
or
to
accuse
him
unstrung
his
every
nerve
and
left
him
with
only
one
consciousness
the
desire
at
all
costs
to
be
saved
cecil
eyes
rested
on
him
with
a
strange
melancholy
pity
he
had
loved
his
brother
as
a
youth
loved
him
well
enough
to
take
and
bear
a
heavy
burden
of
disgrace
in
his
stead
the
old
love
was
not
dead
but
stronger
than
itself
was
his
hatred
of
the
shame
that
had
touched
their
race
by
the
wretched
crime
that
had
driven
him
into
exile
and
his
wondering
scorn
for
the
feeble
and
character
that
had
lived
contentedly
under
false
colors
and
with
a
hidden
blot
screened
by
a
fictitious
semblance
of
honor
he
could
not
linger
with
him
he
did
not
know
how
to
support
the
intolerable
pain
that
oppressed
him
in
the
presence
of
the
only
living
creature
of
his
race
he
could
not
answer
for
himself
what
passionate
and
withering
words
might
not
escape
him
every
instant
of
their
interview
was
a
horrible
temptation
to
him
the
temptation
to
demand
from
this
coward
his
own
justification
before
the
world
the
temptation
to
seize
out
of
those
unworthy
hands
his
birthright
and
his
due
but
the
temptation
sweet
insidious
intense
strengthened
by
the
strength
of
right
and
overwhelming
with
all
its
fair
delicious
promise
for
the
future
did
not
conquer
him
what
resisted
it
was
his
own
simple
instinct
of
justice
an
instinct
too
straight
and
true
either
to
yield
to
or
to
passionate
desire
justice
which
made
him
feel
that
since
he
had
chosen
to
save
this
weakling
once
for
their
lost
mother
sake
he
was
bound
forever
not
to
repent
nor
to
retract
he
gazed
a
while
longer
silently
at
the
younger
man
who
sat
still
rocking
himself
wearily
to
and
fro
on
the
loose
earth
of
the
freshly
filled
grave
then
he
went
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
other
started
and
trembled
he
remembered
that
touch
in
days
of
old
do
not
fear
me
he
said
gently
and
very
gravely
i
have
kept
your
secret
twelve
years
i
will
keep
it
still
be
happy
be
as
happy
as
you
can
all
i
bid
of
you
in
return
is
so
to
live
that
in
your
future
your
past
shall
be
the
words
of
the
saint
to
the
thief
were
not
more
merciful
not
more
noble
than
the
words
with
which
he
purchased
at
the
sacrifice
of
his
own
life
the
redemption
of
his
brother
the
other
looked
at
him
with
a
look
that
was
half
of
terror
terror
at
the
magnitude
of
this
ransom
that
was
given
to
save
him
from
the
bondage
of
evil
my
god
you
can
not
mean
it
and
you
i
shall
lead
the
life
fittest
for
me
i
am
content
in
it
it
is
the
answer
was
very
calm
but
it
choked
him
in
its
utterance
before
his
memory
rose
one
fair
proud
face
content
ah
heaven
it
was
the
only
lie
that
had
ever
passed
his
lips
his
hand
lay
still
upon
his
brother
shoulder
leaning
more
heavily
there
in
the
silence
that
brooded
over
the
hushed
plains
let
us
part
now
and
forever
leave
algeria
at
once
that
is
all
i
then
without
another
word
that
could
add
reproach
or
seek
for
gratitude
he
turned
and
went
away
over
the
great
dim
level
of
the
african
waste
while
the
man
whom
he
had
saved
sat
as
in
stupor
gazing
at
the
brown
shadows
and
the
sleeping
herds
and
the
falling
stars
that
ran
across
the
sky
and
doubting
whether
the
voice
he
had
head
and
the
face
upon
which
he
had
looked
were
not
the
visions
of
a
waking
dream
chapter
xxxii
how
that
night
was
spent
cecil
could
never
recall
in
full
vague
memories
remained
with
him
of
wandering
over
the
shadowy
country
of
seeking
by
bodily
fatigue
to
kill
the
thoughts
rising
in
him
of
drinking
at
a
little
in
the
rocks
as
thirstily
as
some
driven
deer
of
flinging
himself
down
at
length
worn
out
to
sleep
under
the
hanging
brow
of
a
mighty
wall
of
rock
of
waking
when
the
dawn
was
reddening
the
east
with
the
brown
plains
around
him
and
far
away
under
a
knot
of
palms
was
a
goatherd
with
his
flock
like
an
idyl
from
the
old
pastoral
life
of
syria
he
stood
looking
at
the
light
which
heralded
the
sun
with
some
indefinite
sense
of
heavy
loss
of
fresh
calamity
upon
him
it
was
only
slowly
that
he
remembered
all
years
seemed
to
have
been
pressed
into
the
three
nights
and
days
since
he
had
sat
by
the
listening
to
the
fiery
words
of
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
the
full
consciousness
of
all
that
he
had
surrendered
in
yielding
up
afresh
his
heritage
rolled
in
on
his
memory
like
the
wave
of
some
heavy
sea
that
sweeps
down
all
before
it
when
that
and
miserable
letter
had
reached
him
in
the
green
alleys
of
the
stephanien
and
confessed
to
him
that
his
brother
had
relied
on
the
personal
likeness
between
them
and
the
similarity
of
their
handwriting
to
pass
off
as
his
the
bill
in
which
his
own
name
and
that
of
his
friend
was
forged
no
thought
had
crossed
him
to
take
upon
himself
the
lad
sin
it
had
only
been
when
brought
under
the
charge
he
must
to
clear
himself
have
at
once
accused
the
boy
and
have
betrayed
the
woman
whose
reputation
was
in
his
keeping
that
rather
by
generous
impulse
than
by
studied
intention
he
had
taken
up
the
burden
that
he
had
now
carried
for
so
long
whether
or
no
the
had
been
themselves
in
reality
deceived
he
could
never
tell
but
it
had
been
certain
that
having
avowed
themselves
confident
of
his
guilt
they
could
never
shift
the
charge
on
to
his
brother
in
the
face
of
his
own
acceptance
of
it
so
he
had
saved
the
youth
without
premeditation
or
reckoning
of
the
cost
and
now
that
the
full
cost
was
known
to
him
he
had
not
shrunk
back
from
its
payment
yet
that
payment
was
one
that
gave
him
a
greater
anguish
than
if
he
had
laid
down
his
life
in
physical
martyrdom
to
go
back
to
the
old
luxury
and
ease
and
careless
peace
to
go
back
to
the
old
fresh
fair
english
woodlands
to
go
back
to
the
power
of
command
and
the
delight
of
free
gifts
to
go
back
to
men
honor
and
reverence
and
high
esteem
these
would
have
been
sweet
enough
sweet
as
food
after
long
famine
but
far
more
than
these
would
it
have
been
to
go
back
and
take
the
hand
of
his
friend
once
more
in
the
old
unclouded
trust
of
their
youth
to
go
back
and
stand
free
and
blameless
among
his
peers
and
know
that
all
that
man
could
do
to
win
the
heart
and
the
soul
of
a
woman
he
could
at
his
will
do
to
win
hers
whose
mere
glance
of
careless
pity
had
sufficed
to
light
his
life
to
passion
and
he
had
renounced
all
this
this
was
the
cost
and
he
had
paid
it
paid
it
because
the
simple
natural
inflexible
law
of
justice
had
demanded
it
one
whom
he
had
once
chosen
to
save
he
could
not
now
have
deserted
except
by
what
would
have
been
in
his
sight
dishonor
therefore
when
the
day
broke
and
the
memories
of
the
night
came
with
his
awakening
he
knew
that
his
future
was
without
hope
without
it
as
utterly
as
was
ever
that
of
any
captive
shut
in
darkness
and
silence
and
loneliness
in
a
prison
whose
only
issue
was
the
oubliettes
there
is
infinite
misery
in
the
world
but
this
one
misery
is
rare
or
men
would
perish
from
the
face
of
the
earth
as
though
the
sun
withdrew
its
light
alone
in
that
dreary
scene
beautiful
from
its
vastness
and
its
solemnity
but
unutterably
melancholy
unutterably
oppressive
he
also
wondered
whether
he
lived
or
dreamed
from
among
the
reeds
the
plovers
were
rising
over
the
barren
rocks
the
dazzling
lizards
glided
afar
off
strayed
the
goats
that
was
the
only
sign
of
animal
existence
he
had
wandered
a
long
way
from
the
caravanserai
and
he
began
to
retrace
his
steps
for
his
horse
was
there
and
although
he
had
received
license
to
take
leisure
in
returning
he
had
no
home
but
the
camp
no
friends
but
those
throng
around
him
like
a
pack
of
dogs
each
eager
for
the
first
glance
the
first
word
these
companions
of
his
adversity
and
of
his
perils
whom
he
had
learned
to
love
with
all
their
vices
and
all
their
crimes
for
sake
of
the
rough
courageous
love
that
they
could
give
in
answer
he
moved
slowly
back
over
the
desolate
tracks
of
land
stretched
between
him
and
the
algerian
he
had
no
fear
that
he
would
find
his
brother
there
he
knew
too
well
the
nature
with
which
he
had
to
deal
to
hope
that
old
affection
would
so
have
outweighed
present
fear
that
his
debtor
would
have
stayed
to
meet
him
yet
once
more
on
the
impulse
of
the
ungovernable
pain
which
the
other
presence
had
been
he
had
bidden
him
leave
africa
at
once
now
he
almost
wished
he
had
bid
him
stay
there
was
a
weary
unsatisfied
longing
for
some
touch
of
love
or
of
gratitude
from
this
usurper
whom
he
had
raised
in
his
place
he
would
have
been
rewarded
enough
if
one
sign
of
gladness
that
he
lived
had
broken
through
the
egotism
and
the
stricken
fear
of
the
man
whom
he
remembered
as
a
little
child
with
the
hand
of
their
dying
mother
lying
in
benediction
on
the
fair
silken
curls
he
had
asked
no
questions
he
had
gone
back
to
no
recriminations
he
guessed
all
it
needed
him
to
know
and
he
recoiled
from
the
recital
of
the
existence
whose
happiness
was
purchased
by
his
own
misery
and
whose
dignity
was
built
on
sand
his
sacrifice
had
not
been
in
vain
placed
out
of
the
reach
of
temptation
the
plastic
feminine
unstable
character
had
been
without
a
stain
in
the
sight
of
men
but
it
was
little
better
at
the
core
and
he
wondered
in
his
suffering
as
he
went
onward
through
the
beauty
of
the
young
day
whether
it
had
been
worth
the
bitter
price
he
had
paid
to
raise
this
bending
reed
from
out
the
waters
which
would
have
broken
and
swamped
it
at
the
outset
it
grew
fair
and
free
and
now
in
the
midst
of
a
tranquil
and
sunlit
lake
but
was
it
of
more
value
than
a
drifted
weed
bearing
the
hidden
at
its
root
he
had
come
so
far
out
of
the
ordinary
route
across
the
plains
that
it
was
two
hours
or
more
before
he
saw
the
dark
gray
square
of
the
caravanserai
walls
and
to
its
left
that
single
leaning
pine
growing
out
of
a
cleft
within
the
rock
that
overhung
the
spot
where
the
keenest
anguish
of
all
his
life
had
known
had
been
encountered
and
endured
the
spot
which
yet
for
sake
of
the
one
laid
to
rest
there
beneath
the
somber
branches
would
be
forever
dearer
to
him
than
any
other
place
in
the
soil
of
africa
while
yet
the
caravanserai
was
distant
the
piteous
cries
of
a
caught
his
ear
she
was
bleating
beside
a
into
which
her
kid
of
that
spring
had
fallen
and
whose
rapid
swell
filled
by
the
recent
storm
was
too
strong
for
the
young
creature
absorbed
as
he
was
in
his
own
thoughts
the
cry
reached
him
and
drew
him
to
the
spot
it
was
not
in
him
willingly
to
let
any
living
thing
suffer
and
he
was
always
gentle
to
all
animals
he
stooped
and
with
some
little
difficulty
rescued
the
little
goat
for
its
delighted
dam
as
he
bent
over
the
water
he
saw
something
glitter
beneath
it
he
caught
it
in
his
hand
and
brought
it
up
it
was
the
broken
half
of
a
chain
of
gold
with
a
jewel
in
each
link
he
changed
color
as
he
saw
it
he
remembered
it
as
one
that
venetia
corona
had
worn
on
the
morning
that
he
had
been
admitted
to
her
it
was
of
peculiar
workmanship
and
he
recognized
it
at
once
he
stood
with
the
toy
in
his
hand
looking
long
at
the
shining
links
with
their
flashes
of
precious
stones
they
seemed
to
have
voices
that
spoke
to
him
of
her
about
whose
beautiful
white
throat
they
had
been
woven
voices
that
whispered
incessantly
in
his
ear
take
up
your
birthright
and
you
will
be
free
to
sue
to
her
at
least
if
not
to
win
no
golden
and
jeweled
plaything
ever
tempted
a
starving
man
to
theft
as
this
tempted
him
now
to
break
the
pledge
he
had
just
given
his
birthright
he
longed
for
it
for
this
woman
sake
for
the
sake
at
least
of
the
right
to
stand
before
her
as
an
equal
and
to
risk
his
chance
with
others
who
sought
her
smile
as
he
had
never
done
for
any
other
thing
which
with
that
heritage
would
have
become
his
yet
he
knew
that
even
were
he
to
be
false
to
his
word
and
go
forward
and
claim
his
right
he
would
never
be
able
to
prove
his
innocence
he
would
never
hope
to
make
the
would
believe
him
unless
the
real
criminal
made
that
confession
which
he
held
himself
forbidden
by
his
own
past
action
ever
to
extort
he
gazed
long
at
the
broken
costly
toy
while
his
heart
ached
with
a
cruel
pang
then
he
placed
it
in
safety
in
the
little
blue
enamel
box
beside
the
ring
which
cigarette
had
flung
back
to
him
and
went
onward
to
the
caravanserai
she
was
no
longer
there
in
all
probability
but
the
lost
bagatelle
would
give
him
some
time
or
another
a
plea
on
which
to
enter
her
presence
it
was
a
pleasure
to
him
to
know
that
though
he
knew
also
that
every
added
moment
spent
under
the
sweet
sovereignty
of
her
glance
was
so
much
added
pain
so
much
added
folly
to
the
and
baseless
passion
with
which
she
had
inspired
him
the
trifling
incident
of
the
goat
rescue
and
the
chain
trouvaille
slight
as
they
were
still
were
of
service
to
him
they
called
him
back
from
the
past
to
the
present
they
broke
the
stupor
of
suffering
that
had
fastened
on
him
they
recalled
him
to
the
actual
world
about
him
in
which
he
had
to
fulfill
his
duties
as
a
trooper
of
france
it
was
almost
noon
when
under
the
branches
of
the
pine
that
stretched
its
somber
fans
up
against
the
glittering
azure
of
the
morning
skies
he
approached
the
gates
of
the
algerine
a
study
for
the
color
of
gerome
with
the
pearly
gray
of
its
stone
tints
and
the
pigeons
wheeling
above
its
corner
towers
while
under
the
arch
of
its
entrance
a
string
of
mules
were
guided
and
on
its
bench
sat
a
french
soldier
singing
gayly
songs
of
paris
while
he
cut
open
a
yellow
gourd
cecil
went
within
and
bathed
and
dressed
and
drank
some
of
the
thin
cool
wine
that
found
its
way
thither
in
the
wake
of
the
french
army
then
he
sat
down
for
a
while
at
one
of
the
square
holes
which
served
for
casements
in
the
tower
he
occupied
and
looking
out
into
the
court
tried
to
shape
his
thoughts
and
plan
his
course
as
a
soldier
he
had
no
freedom
no
will
of
his
own
save
for
this
extra
twelve
or
hours
which
they
had
allowed
him
for
leisure
in
his
return
journey
he
was
obliged
to
go
back
to
his
camp
and
there
he
knew
he
might
again
encounter
one
whose
tender
memories
would
be
as
quick
to
recognize
him
as
the
craven
dread
of
his
brother
had
been
he
had
always
feared
this
ordeal
although
the
arduous
service
in
which
his
chief
years
in
africa
had
been
spent
and
the
remote
expeditions
on
which
he
had
always
been
employed
had
partially
removed
him
from
the
danger
of
such
recognition
until
now
and
now
he
felt
that
if
once
the
brave
kind
eyes
of
his
old
friend
should
meet
his
own
concealment
would
be
no
longer
possible
yet
for
the
sake
of
that
promise
he
had
sworn
in
the
past
night
it
must
be
maintained
at
every
hazard
every
cost
vacantly
he
sat
and
watched
the
play
of
the
sunshine
in
the
prismatic
water
of
the
courtyard
fountain
and
the
splashing
and
the
pluming
and
the
murmuring
of
the
doves
and
pigeons
on
its
edge
he
felt
meshed
in
a
net
from
which
there
was
no
escape
none
unless
on
his
homeward
passage
a
thrust
of
arab
steel
should
give
him
liberty
the
trampling
of
horses
on
the
pavement
below
roused
his
attention
a
thrill
of
hope
went
through
him
that
his
brother
might
have
lingering
conscience
latent
love
enough
to
have
made
him
refuse
to
obey
the
bidding
to
leave
africa
he
rose
and
leaned
out
amid
the
little
throng
of
grooms
and
attendants
who
made
an
open
way
through
the
polyglot
crowd
of
an
algerian
caravanserai
at
noon
he
saw
the
one
dazzling
face
of
which
he
had
so
lately
dreamed
by
the
in
the
plains
it
was
but
a
moment
glance
for
she
had
already
dismounted
from
her
mare
and
was
passing
within
with
two
other
ladies
of
her
party
but
in
that
one
glance
he
knew
her
his
discovery
of
the
chain
gave
him
a
plea
to
seek
her
should
he
avail
himself
of
it
he
hesitated
a
while
it
would
be
safest
wisest
best
to
deliver
up
the
trinket
to
her
courier
and
pass
on
his
way
without
another
look
at
that
beauty
which
could
never
be
his
which
could
never
lighten
for
him
even
with
the
smile
that
a
woman
may
give
her
equal
or
her
friend
she
could
never
be
aught
to
him
save
one
more
memory
of
pain
save
one
remembrance
the
more
to
embitter
the
career
which
not
even
hope
would
ever
illumine
he
knew
that
it
was
only
madness
to
go
into
her
presence
and
feed
with
the
cadence
of
her
voice
the
gold
light
of
her
hair
the
grace
and
graciousness
of
her
every
movement
the
love
which
she
would
deem
such
intolerable
insult
that
did
he
ever
speak
it
she
would
order
her
people
to
drive
him
from
her
like
a
chidden
hound
he
knew
that
but
he
longed
to
indulge
the
madness
despite
it
and
he
did
so
he
went
down
into
the
court
below
and
found
her
suite
tell
your
mistress
that
i
louis
victor
have
some
jewels
which
belong
to
her
and
ask
her
permission
to
restore
them
to
her
hands
he
said
to
one
of
her
equerries
give
them
to
me
if
you
have
picked
them
up
said
the
man
putting
out
his
hand
for
them
cecil
closed
his
own
upon
them
go
and
do
as
i
bid
the
equerry
paused
doubtful
whether
or
no
to
resist
the
tone
and
the
words
a
frenchman
respect
for
the
military
uniform
prevailed
he
went
within
in
the
best
chamber
of
the
caravanserai
venetia
corona
was
sitting
listless
in
the
heat
when
her
attendant
entered
the
grandes
dames
who
were
her
companions
in
their
tour
through
the
seat
of
war
were
gone
to
their
siesta
she
was
alone
with
a
scarlet
burnous
thrown
about
her
and
upon
her
all
the
languor
and
idleness
common
to
the
noontide
which
was
still
very
warm
though
in
the
autumn
the
nights
were
so
icily
cold
on
the
exposed
level
of
the
plains
she
was
lost
in
thought
moreover
she
had
heard
the
day
before
a
story
that
had
touched
her
of
a
soldier
who
had
been
slain
crossing
the
plains
and
had
been
brought
through
the
hurricane
and
the
sandstorm
at
every
risk
by
his
comrade
who
had
chosen
to
endure
all
peril
and
wretchedness
rather
than
leave
the
dead
body
to
the
vultures
and
the
kites
it
was
a
nameless
story
to
her
the
story
of
two
obscure
troopers
who
for
aught
she
knew
might
have
been
two
of
the
riotous
and
savage
brigands
that
were
common
in
the
army
of
africa
but
the
loyalty
and
the
love
shown
in
it
had
moved
her
and
to
the
woman
whose
life
had
been
cloudless
and
cradled
in
ease
from
her
birth
there
was
that
in
the
suffering
and
the
sacrifice
which
the
anecdote
suggested
that
had
at
once
the
fascination
of
the
unknown
and
the
pathos
of
a
life
so
far
removed
from
her
so
little
dreamed
of
by
her
that
all
its
coarser
cruelty
was
hidden
while
only
its
unutterable
sadness
and
courage
remained
before
her
sight
had
she
could
she
ever
have
seen
it
in
its
realities
watched
and
read
and
understood
it
she
would
have
been
too
intensely
revolted
to
have
perceived
the
actual
latent
nobility
possible
in
such
an
existence
as
it
was
she
heard
but
of
it
in
such
words
as
alone
could
meet
the
ear
of
a
great
lady
she
gazed
at
it
only
in
pity
from
a
height
and
its
terrible
tragedy
had
solemnity
and
beauty
for
her
when
her
servant
approached
her
now
with
cecil
message
she
hesitated
some
few
moments
in
surprise
she
had
not
known
that
he
was
in
her
vicinity
the
story
she
had
heard
had
been
simply
of
two
unnamed
chasseurs
and
he
himself
might
have
fallen
on
the
field
weeks
before
for
aught
that
she
had
heard
of
him
some
stray
rumors
of
his
defense
of
the
encampment
of
zaraila
and
of
the
fine
prowess
shown
in
his
last
charge
alone
had
drifted
to
her
he
was
but
a
trooper
and
he
fought
in
africa
the
world
had
no
concern
with
him
save
the
miniature
world
of
his
own
regiment
she
hesitated
some
moments
then
gave
the
required
permission
he
has
once
been
a
gentleman
it
would
be
cruel
to
wound
him
thought
the
imperial
beauty
who
would
have
refused
a
prince
or
neglected
a
duke
with
chill
indifference
but
who
was
too
generous
to
risk
the
semblance
of
humiliation
to
the
man
who
could
never
approach
her
save
upon
such
sufferance
as
was
in
itself
mortification
to
one
whose
pride
survived
his
fallen
fortunes
moreover
the
interest
he
had
succeeded
in
awakening
in
her
the
mingling
of
pity
and
of
respect
that
his
words
and
his
bearing
had
aroused
was
not
extinct
had
indeed
only
been
strengthened
by
the
vague
stories
that
had
of
late
floated
to
her
of
the
day
of
zaraila
of
the
day
of
smoke
and
steel
and
carnage
of
war
in
its
grandest
yet
its
most
frightful
shape
of
the
darkness
of
death
which
the
courage
of
human
souls
had
power
to
illumine
as
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
something
more
like
quickened
and
pleasured
expectation
than
any
one
among
her
many
lovers
had
ever
had
power
to
rouse
moved
her
as
she
heard
of
the
presence
of
the
man
who
in
that
day
had
saved
the
honor
of
his
flag
she
came
of
a
heroic
race
she
had
heroic
blood
in
her
and
heroism
physical
and
moral
won
her
regard
as
no
other
quality
could
ever
do
a
man
capable
of
daring
greatly
and
of
suffering
silently
was
the
only
man
who
could
ever
hope
to
hold
her
thoughts
the
room
was
darkened
from
the
piercing
light
without
and
in
its
gloom
as
he
was
ushered
in
the
scarlet
of
her
cashmere
and
the
gleam
of
her
fair
hair
was
all
that
for
the
moment
he
could
see
he
bowed
very
low
that
he
might
get
his
calmness
back
before
he
looked
at
her
and
her
voice
in
its
lingering
music
came
on
his
ear
you
have
found
my
chain
i
think
i
lost
it
in
riding
yesterday
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
you
for
taking
care
of
she
felt
that
she
could
only
thank
as
she
would
have
thanked
an
equal
who
should
have
done
her
this
sort
of
slight
service
the
man
who
had
brought
to
her
the
gold
pieces
with
which
his
colonel
had
insulted
him
it
is
i
madame
who
am
the
debtor
of
so
happy
an
his
words
were
very
low
and
his
voice
shook
a
little
over
them
he
was
thinking
not
of
the
jeweled
toy
that
he
came
here
to
restore
but
of
the
inheritance
that
had
passed
away
from
him
forever
and
which
possessed
would
have
given
him
the
title
to
seek
what
his
own
efforts
could
do
to
wake
a
look
of
tenderness
in
those
proud
eyes
which
men
ever
called
so
cold
but
which
he
felt
might
still
soften
and
change
and
grow
dark
with
the
thoughts
and
the
passions
of
love
if
the
soul
that
gazed
through
them
were
but
once
stirred
from
its
repose
your
chain
is
here
madame
though
broken
i
regret
to
see
he
continued
as
he
took
the
little
box
from
his
coat
and
handed
it
to
her
she
took
it
and
thanked
him
without
for
the
moment
opening
the
enamel
case
as
she
motioned
him
to
a
seat
at
a
little
distance
from
her
own
you
have
been
in
terrible
scenes
since
i
saw
you
last
she
continued
the
story
of
zaraila
reached
us
surely
they
can
not
refuse
you
the
reward
of
your
service
now
it
will
make
little
difference
madame
whether
they
do
or
little
difference
how
is
that
to
my
own
fate
i
meant
whether
i
be
captain
or
a
corporal
can
not
alter
he
paused
he
dreaded
lest
the
word
should
escape
him
which
should
reveal
to
her
that
which
she
would
regard
as
such
intolerable
offense
such
insolent
indignity
when
felt
for
her
by
a
soldier
in
the
grade
he
held
no
yet
such
recognition
is
usually
the
ambition
of
every
military
a
very
weary
smile
passed
over
his
face
i
have
no
ambition
madame
or
if
i
have
it
is
not
a
pair
of
epaulettes
that
will
content
she
understood
him
she
comprehended
the
bitter
mockery
that
the
tawdry
meretricious
rewards
of
regimental
decoration
seemed
to
the
man
who
had
waited
to
die
at
zaraila
as
patiently
and
as
grandly
as
the
old
guard
at
waterloo
i
understand
the
rewards
are
pitifully
disproportionate
to
the
services
in
the
army
yet
how
magnificently
you
and
your
men
as
i
have
been
told
held
your
ground
all
through
that
fearful
day
we
did
our
duty
nothing
well
is
not
that
the
rarest
thing
among
men
not
among
soldiers
then
you
think
that
every
trooper
in
a
regiment
is
actuated
by
the
finest
and
most
impersonal
sentiment
that
can
actuate
human
beings
i
will
not
say
that
poor
wretches
they
are
degraded
enough
too
often
but
i
believe
that
more
or
less
in
every
good
soldier
even
when
he
is
utterly
unconscious
of
it
is
an
impersonal
love
for
the
honor
of
his
flag
an
uncalculating
instinct
to
do
his
best
for
the
reputation
of
his
corps
we
are
called
human
machines
we
are
so
since
we
move
by
no
will
of
our
own
but
the
lowest
among
us
will
at
times
be
propelled
by
one
single
impulse
a
desire
to
die
greatly
it
is
all
that
is
left
to
most
of
us
to
she
looked
at
him
with
that
old
look
which
he
had
seen
once
or
twice
before
in
her
of
pity
respect
sympathy
and
wonder
all
in
one
he
spoke
to
her
as
he
had
never
spoken
to
any
living
being
the
grave
quiet
listless
impassiveness
that
still
was
habitual
with
him
relic
of
the
old
habits
of
his
former
life
was
very
rarely
broken
for
his
real
nature
or
his
real
thoughts
to
be
seen
beneath
it
but
she
so
far
removed
from
him
by
position
and
by
circumstance
and
distant
with
him
as
a
great
lady
could
not
but
be
with
a
soldier
of
whose
antecedents
and
whose
character
she
knew
nothing
gave
him
sympathy
a
sympathy
that
was
sweet
and
rather
felt
than
uttered
and
it
was
like
balm
to
a
wound
like
sweet
melodies
on
a
weary
ear
to
the
man
who
had
carried
his
secret
so
silently
and
so
long
without
one
to
know
his
burden
or
to
soothe
his
pain
yes
she
said
thoughtfully
while
over
the
brilliancy
of
her
face
there
passed
a
shadow
there
must
be
infinite
nobility
among
these
men
who
live
without
hope
live
only
to
die
that
soldier
a
day
or
two
ago
who
brought
his
dead
comrade
through
the
hurricane
risking
his
own
death
rather
than
leave
the
body
to
the
you
have
heard
of
him
what
tenderness
what
greatness
there
must
have
been
in
that
poor
fellow
heart
oh
no
that
was
nothing
they
have
told
me
he
came
every
inch
of
the
way
in
danger
of
the
arabs
shot
and
steel
he
had
suffered
so
much
to
bring
the
body
safe
across
the
plains
he
fell
down
insensible
on
his
entrance
you
set
too
much
store
on
it
i
owed
him
a
debt
far
greater
than
any
act
like
that
could
ever
you
was
it
you
yes
madame
he
who
perished
had
a
thousandfold
more
of
such
nobility
as
you
have
praised
than
ah
tell
me
of
him
she
said
simply
but
he
saw
that
the
lustrous
eyes
bent
on
him
had
a
grave
sweet
sadness
in
them
that
was
more
precious
and
more
pitiful
than
a
million
utterances
of
regret
could
ever
have
been
those
belied
her
much
who
said
that
she
was
heartless
though
grief
had
never
touched
her
she
could
feel
keenly
the
grief
of
other
lives
he
obeyed
her
bidding
now
and
told
her
in
brief
words
the
story
which
had
a
profound
pathos
spoken
there
where
without
through
the
oval
unglazed
casement
in
the
distance
there
was
seen
the
tall
dark
leaning
pine
that
overhung
the
grave
of
yesternight
the
story
over
which
his
voice
oftentimes
fell
with
the
hush
of
a
cruel
pain
in
it
and
which
he
could
have
related
to
no
other
save
herself
it
had
an
intense
melancholy
and
a
strange
beauty
in
its
brevity
and
its
simplicity
told
in
that
gaunt
still
darkened
chamber
of
the
caravanserai
with
the
gray
gloom
of
its
stone
walls
around
and
the
rays
of
the
golden
sunlight
from
without
straying
in
to
touch
the
glistening
hair
of
the
proud
head
that
bent
forward
to
listen
to
the
recital
her
face
grew
paler
as
she
heard
and
a
mist
was
over
the
radiance
of
her
azure
eyes
that
death
in
the
loneliness
of
the
plains
moved
her
deeply
with
the
grand
simplicity
of
its
unconscious
heroism
and
though
he
spoke
little
of
himself
she
felt
with
all
the
divination
of
a
woman
sympathies
how
he
who
told
her
this
thing
had
suffered
by
it
suffered
far
more
than
the
comrade
whom
he
had
laid
down
in
the
grave
where
far
off
in
the
noonday
warmth
the
young
goats
were
at
rest
on
the
sod
when
he
ceased
there
was
a
long
silence
he
had
lost
even
the
memory
of
her
in
the
memory
of
the
death
that
he
had
painted
to
her
and
she
was
moved
with
that
wondering
pain
that
emotion
half
dread
and
half
regret
with
which
the
contemplation
of
calamities
that
have
never
touched
and
that
can
never
touch
them
will
move
women
far
more
callous
far
more
than
herself
in
the
silence
her
hands
toyed
listlessly
with
the
enamel
bonbonniere
whose
silver
had
lost
all
its
bright
enameling
and
was
dinted
and
dulled
till
it
looked
no
more
than
lead
the
lid
came
off
at
her
touch
as
she
musingly
moved
it
round
and
round
the
chain
and
the
ring
fell
into
her
lap
the
lid
remained
in
her
hand
its
interior
unspoiled
and
studded
in
its
center
with
a
name
in
turquoise
letters
she
started
as
the
word
caught
her
eye
and
broke
her
reverie
the
color
came
warmer
into
her
cheek
she
looked
closer
and
closer
at
the
box
then
with
a
rapid
movement
turned
her
head
and
gazed
at
her
companion
how
did
you
obtain
this
the
chain
madame
it
had
fallen
in
the
the
chain
no
the
box
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
it
was
given
me
very
long
and
by
whom
by
a
young
child
her
lips
parted
slightly
the
flush
on
her
cheeks
deepened
the
beautiful
face
which
the
roman
sculptor
had
said
only
wanted
tenderness
to
make
it
perfect
changed
moved
was
quickened
with
a
thousand
shadows
of
thought
the
box
is
mine
i
gave
it
and
you
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
entranced
before
her
breathless
and
mute
and
you
she
repeated
he
was
silent
still
gazing
at
her
he
knew
her
now
how
had
he
been
so
blind
as
never
to
guess
the
truth
before
as
never
to
know
that
those
imperial
eyes
and
that
diadem
of
golden
hair
could
belong
alone
but
to
the
women
of
one
race
and
you
she
cried
once
more
while
she
stretched
her
hand
out
to
him
and
you
you
are
philip
friend
you
are
bertie
cecil
silently
he
bowed
his
head
not
even
for
his
brother
sake
or
for
the
sake
of
his
pledged
word
could
he
have
lied
to
her
but
her
outstretched
hands
he
would
not
see
he
would
not
take
the
shadow
of
an
imputed
crime
was
stretched
between
them
petite
reine
he
murmured
ah
god
how
could
i
be
so
blind
she
grew
very
pale
as
she
sank
back
again
upon
the
couch
from
which
she
had
risen
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
a
thousand
years
had
drifted
by
since
she
had
stood
beside
this
man
under
the
summer
leaves
of
the
stephanien
and
he
had
kissed
her
childish
lips
and
thanked
her
for
her
loving
gift
and
now
they
had
met
thus
he
said
nothing
he
stood
paralyzed
gazing
at
her
there
had
been
no
added
bitterness
needed
in
the
cup
which
he
drank
for
his
sake
yet
this
bitterness
surpassed
all
other
it
seemed
beyond
his
strength
to
leave
her
in
the
belief
that
he
was
guilty
she
in
whom
all
fair
and
gracious
things
were
met
she
who
was
linked
by
her
race
to
his
past
and
his
youth
she
whose
clear
eyes
in
her
childhood
had
looked
upon
him
in
that
first
hour
of
the
agony
that
he
had
suffered
then
and
still
suffered
on
in
the
cause
of
a
coward
and
an
ingrate
she
was
pale
still
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
a
gaze
that
recalled
to
him
the
look
with
which
petite
reine
had
promised
that
summer
day
to
keep
his
secret
and
tell
none
of
that
misery
of
which
she
had
been
witness
they
thought
that
you
were
dead
she
said
at
length
while
her
voice
sank
very
low
why
have
you
lived
like
this
he
made
no
answer
it
was
cruel
to
philip
she
went
on
while
her
voice
still
shook
child
though
i
was
i
remember
his
passion
of
grief
when
the
news
came
that
you
had
lost
your
life
he
has
never
forgotten
you
so
often
now
he
will
still
speak
of
you
he
is
in
your
camp
we
are
traveling
together
he
will
be
here
this
evening
what
delight
it
will
give
him
to
know
his
dearest
friend
is
living
but
why
why
have
kept
him
ignorant
if
you
were
lost
to
all
the
world
beside
still
he
answered
her
nothing
the
truth
he
could
not
tell
the
lie
he
would
not
she
paused
waiting
reply
receiving
none
she
spoke
once
more
her
words
full
of
that
exquisite
softness
which
was
far
more
beautiful
in
her
than
in
women
less
tranquil
less
chill
and
less
negligent
in
ordinary
moments
mr
cecil
i
divined
rightly
i
knew
that
you
were
far
higher
than
your
grade
in
africa
i
felt
that
in
all
things
save
in
some
accident
of
position
we
were
equals
but
why
have
you
condemned
yourself
to
this
misery
your
life
is
brave
is
noble
but
it
must
be
a
constant
torture
to
such
as
you
i
remember
well
what
you
were
so
well
that
i
wonder
we
have
never
recognized
each
other
before
now
the
existence
you
lead
in
algeria
must
be
very
terrible
to
you
though
it
is
greater
in
truth
than
your
old
years
of
he
sank
down
beside
her
on
a
low
seat
and
bowed
his
head
on
his
hands
for
some
moments
he
knew
that
he
must
leave
this
woman
whom
he
loved
and
who
knew
him
now
as
one
whom
in
her
childhood
she
had
seen
caressed
and
welcomed
by
all
her
race
to
hold
him
guilty
of
this
wretched
mean
and
fraudulent
thing
under
whose
charge
he
had
quitted
her
country
great
dews
of
intense
pain
gathered
on
his
forehead
his
whole
mind
and
heart
and
soul
revolted
against
this
brand
of
a
guilt
not
his
own
that
was
stamped
on
him
he
could
have
cried
out
to
her
the
truth
in
all
the
eloquence
of
a
breaking
heart
but
he
knew
that
his
lips
had
been
sealed
by
his
own
choice
forever
and
the
old
habits
of
his
early
life
were
strong
upon
him
still
he
lifted
his
head
and
spoke
gently
and
very
quietly
though
she
caught
the
tremor
that
shook
through
the
words
do
not
let
us
speak
of
myself
you
see
what
my
life
is
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
tell
me
rather
of
your
own
story
you
are
no
longer
the
lady
venetia
you
have
been
wedded
and
widowed
they
say
the
wife
of
an
hour
yes
but
it
is
of
yourself
that
i
would
hear
why
have
left
the
world
and
above
all
why
have
left
us
to
think
you
dead
i
was
not
so
young
when
we
last
saw
you
but
that
i
remember
well
how
all
my
people
loved
had
she
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
accusation
beneath
which
his
flight
had
been
made
he
began
to
think
so
it
was
possible
she
had
been
so
young
a
child
when
he
had
left
for
africa
then
the
story
was
probably
withheld
from
reaching
her
and
now
what
memory
had
the
world
to
give
a
man
whose
requiem
it
had
said
twelve
long
years
before
in
all
likelihood
she
had
never
heard
his
name
save
from
her
brother
lips
that
had
been
silent
on
the
shame
of
his
old
comrade
leave
my
life
alone
for
god
sake
he
said
passionately
tell
me
of
your
own
tell
me
above
all
of
his
he
loved
me
you
say
o
heaven
he
did
better
than
any
creature
that
ever
breathed
save
the
man
whose
grave
lies
he
does
so
still
she
answered
eagerly
philip
is
not
a
heart
that
forgets
it
is
a
heart
of
gold
and
the
name
of
his
earliest
friend
is
graven
on
it
as
deeply
now
as
ever
he
thinks
you
dead
will
be
the
happiest
hour
he
had
ever
known
when
he
shall
meet
you
he
rose
hastily
and
moved
thrice
to
and
fro
the
narrow
floor
whose
rugged
earth
had
been
covered
with
furs
and
rugs
lest
it
should
strike
a
chill
to
her
as
she
passed
over
it
the
torture
grew
unsupportable
to
him
and
yet
it
had
so
much
of
sweetness
that
he
was
powerless
to
end
it
sweetness
in
the
knowledge
that
she
knew
him
now
her
equal
at
least
by
birth
in
the
change
that
it
had
made
in
her
voice
and
her
glance
while
the
first
grew
tender
with
olden
memories
and
the
last
had
the
smile
of
friendship
in
the
closeness
of
the
remembrances
that
seemed
to
draw
and
bind
them
together
in
the
swift
sense
that
in
an
instant
by
the
utterance
of
a
name
the
of
caste
which
had
been
between
them
had
fallen
now
and
forever
she
watched
him
with
grave
musing
eyes
she
was
moved
startled
softened
to
a
profound
pity
for
him
and
filled
with
a
wondering
of
regret
yet
a
strong
emotion
of
relief
of
pleasure
rose
above
these
she
had
never
forgotten
the
man
to
whom
in
her
childish
innocence
she
had
brought
the
gifts
of
her
golden
store
she
was
glad
that
he
lived
though
he
lived
thus
glad
with
a
quicker
warmer
more
vivid
emotion
than
any
that
had
ever
occupied
her
for
any
man
living
or
dead
except
her
brother
the
interest
she
had
vaguely
felt
in
a
stranger
fortunes
and
which
she
had
driven
contemptuously
away
as
unworthy
of
her
harboring
was
justified
for
one
whom
her
people
had
known
and
valued
while
she
had
been
in
her
infancy
and
of
whom
she
had
never
heard
from
her
brother
lips
aught
except
constant
regret
and
imperishable
attachment
for
it
was
true
as
cecil
divined
that
the
dark
cloud
under
which
his
memory
had
passed
to
all
in
england
had
never
been
seen
by
her
eyes
from
which
in
childhood
it
had
been
screened
and
in
womanhood
withheld
because
his
name
had
been
absolutely
forgotten
by
all
save
the
seraph
to
whom
it
had
been
fraught
with
too
much
pain
for
its
utterance
to
be
ever
voluntary
what
is
it
you
fear
from
philip
she
asked
him
at
last
when
she
had
waited
vainly
for
him
to
break
the
silence
you
can
remember
him
but
ill
if
you
think
that
there
will
be
anything
in
his
heart
save
joy
when
he
shall
know
that
you
are
living
you
little
dream
how
dear
your
memory
is
to
him
he
paused
before
her
abruptly
hush
hush
or
you
will
kill
me
why
three
nights
ago
i
fled
the
camp
as
men
flee
pestilence
because
i
saw
his
face
in
the
light
of
the
and
dreaded
that
he
should
so
see
mine
she
gazed
at
him
in
troubled
amaze
there
was
that
in
the
passionate
agitation
of
this
man
who
had
been
serene
through
so
much
danger
and
unmoved
beneath
so
much
disaster
that
startled
and
bewildered
her
you
fled
from
philip
ah
how
you
must
wrong
him
what
will
it
matter
to
him
whether
you
be
prince
or
trooper
wear
a
peer
robes
or
a
soldier
uniform
his
friendship
never
yet
was
given
to
externals
but
why
that
reminds
me
of
your
inheritance
do
you
know
that
lord
royallieu
is
dead
that
your
younger
brother
bears
the
title
thinking
you
perished
at
marseilles
he
was
here
with
me
yesterday
he
has
come
to
algeria
for
the
autumn
whatever
your
motive
may
have
been
to
remain
thus
hidden
from
us
all
you
must
claim
your
own
rights
now
you
must
go
back
to
all
that
is
so
justly
yours
whatever
your
reason
be
to
have
borne
with
all
the
suffering
and
the
indignity
that
have
been
your
portion
here
they
will
be
ended
her
beauty
had
never
struck
him
as
intensely
as
at
this
moment
when
in
urging
him
to
the
demand
of
his
rights
she
so
unconsciously
tempted
him
to
betray
his
brother
and
to
forsake
his
word
the
indifference
and
the
careless
coldness
that
had
to
so
many
seemed
impenetrable
and
unalterable
in
her
were
broken
and
had
changed
to
the
warmth
of
sympathy
of
interest
of
excitation
there
was
a
world
of
feeling
in
her
face
of
eloquence
in
her
eyes
as
she
stooped
slightly
forward
with
the
rich
glow
of
the
cashmeres
about
her
and
the
falling
across
her
brow
pure
and
proud
and
noble
in
every
thought
and
pressing
on
him
now
what
was
the
due
of
his
birth
and
his
heritage
she
yet
unwittingly
tempted
him
with
as
deadly
a
power
as
though
she
were
the
vilest
of
her
sex
seducing
him
downward
to
some
infamous
dishonor
to
do
what
she
said
would
be
but
his
actual
right
and
would
open
to
him
a
future
so
fair
that
his
heart
grew
sick
with
longing
for
it
and
yet
to
yield
and
to
claim
justice
for
himself
was
forbidden
him
as
utterly
as
though
it
were
some
murderous
guilt
he
had
promised
never
to
sacrifice
his
brother
the
promise
held
him
like
the
fetters
of
a
galley
slave
why
do
you
not
answer
me
she
pursued
while
she
leaned
nearer
with
wonder
and
doubt
and
a
certain
awakening
dread
shadowing
the
blue
luster
of
her
eyes
that
were
bent
so
thoughtfully
so
searchingly
upon
him
is
it
possible
that
you
have
heard
of
your
inheritance
of
your
title
and
estates
and
that
you
voluntarily
remain
a
soldier
here
lord
royallieu
must
yield
them
in
the
instant
you
prove
your
identity
and
in
that
there
could
be
no
difficulty
i
remember
you
well
now
and
philip
i
am
certain
will
only
need
to
see
you
once
to
hush
for
pity
sake
have
you
never
heard
have
none
ever
told
you
what
her
face
grew
paler
with
a
vague
sense
of
fear
she
knew
that
he
had
been
equable
and
resolute
under
the
severest
tests
that
could
try
the
strength
and
the
patience
of
man
and
she
knew
therefore
that
no
slender
thing
could
agitate
and
could
unman
him
thus
what
is
it
i
should
have
heard
she
asked
him
as
he
kept
his
silence
he
turned
from
her
so
that
she
could
not
see
his
face
that
when
i
became
dead
to
the
world
i
died
with
the
taint
of
crime
on
me
of
crime
an
intense
horror
thrilled
through
the
echo
of
the
word
but
she
rose
and
moved
and
faced
him
with
the
fearless
resolve
of
a
woman
whom
no
would
blind
and
no
shadowy
terror
appall
of
crime
what
crime
then
and
then
only
he
looked
at
her
a
strange
fixed
hopeless
yet
serene
look
that
she
knew
no
criminal
ever
would
or
could
have
given
i
was
accused
of
having
forged
your
brother
a
faint
cry
escaped
her
her
lips
grew
white
and
her
eyes
darkened
and
dilated
accused
but
wrongfully
his
breath
came
and
went
in
quick
sharp
spasms
i
could
not
prove
not
prove
it
why
i
could
but
he
philip
never
believed
you
guilty
i
can
not
tell
he
may
he
but
you
are
not
it
was
not
an
interrogation
but
an
affirmation
that
rang
out
in
the
silver
clearness
of
her
voice
there
was
not
a
single
intonation
of
doubt
in
it
there
was
rather
a
haughty
authority
that
forbade
even
himself
to
say
that
one
of
his
race
and
that
one
of
his
order
could
have
been
capable
of
such
ignoble
and
craven
sin
his
mouth
quivered
a
bitter
sigh
broke
from
him
he
turned
his
eyes
on
her
with
a
look
that
pierced
her
to
the
heart
think
me
guilty
or
guiltless
as
you
will
i
can
not
answer
his
last
words
were
suffocated
with
the
supreme
anguish
of
their
utterance
as
she
heard
it
the
generosity
the
faith
the
inherent
justice
and
the
intrinsic
sweetness
that
were
latent
in
her
beneath
the
negligence
and
the
chillness
of
external
semblance
rose
at
once
to
reject
the
baser
to
accept
the
nobler
belief
offered
to
her
choice
she
had
lived
much
in
the
world
but
it
had
not
corroded
her
she
had
acquired
keen
discernment
from
it
but
she
had
preserved
all
the
courageous
and
the
chivalrous
instincts
of
her
superb
nature
she
looked
at
him
now
and
stretched
her
hands
out
toward
him
with
a
royal
and
gracious
gesture
of
infinite
eloquence
you
are
guiltless
whatever
circumstance
may
have
arrayed
against
you
whatever
shadow
of
evil
may
have
fallen
falsely
on
you
is
it
not
so
he
bowed
his
head
low
over
her
hands
as
he
took
them
in
that
moment
half
the
bitterness
of
his
doom
passed
from
him
he
had
at
least
her
faith
but
his
face
was
bloodless
as
that
of
a
corpse
and
the
loud
beatings
of
his
heart
were
audible
on
the
stillness
this
faith
must
live
on
without
one
thing
to
show
that
he
deserved
it
if
in
time
to
come
it
should
waver
and
fall
and
leave
him
in
the
darkness
of
the
foul
suspicion
under
which
he
dwelt
what
wonder
would
there
be
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
her
full
in
the
eyes
her
own
closed
involuntarily
and
filled
with
tears
she
felt
that
the
despair
and
the
patience
of
that
look
would
haunt
her
until
her
dying
day
i
was
guiltless
but
none
could
credit
it
then
none
would
do
so
now
nor
can
i
seek
to
make
them
ask
me
no
more
give
me
your
belief
if
you
can
god
knows
what
precious
mercy
it
is
to
me
but
leave
me
to
fulfill
my
fate
and
tell
no
living
creature
what
i
have
told
you
the
great
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
and
blinded
her
as
she
heard
even
in
the
amaze
and
the
vagueness
of
this
first
knowledge
of
the
cause
of
his
exile
she
felt
instinctively
as
the
little
one
also
had
done
that
some
great
sacrifice
some
great
fortitude
and
generosity
lay
within
this
sealed
secret
of
his
sufferance
of
wrong
she
knew
too
that
it
would
be
useless
to
seek
to
learn
that
which
he
had
chosen
to
conceal
that
for
no
slender
cause
could
he
have
come
out
to
lead
this
life
of
whose
sufferings
she
could
gauge
the
measure
that
nothing
save
some
absolute
and
imperative
reason
could
have
driven
him
to
accept
such
living
death
as
was
his
doom
in
africa
tell
no
one
she
echoed
what
not
philip
even
not
your
oldest
friend
ah
be
sure
whatever
the
evidence
might
be
against
you
his
heart
never
condemned
you
for
one
i
believe
it
yet
all
you
can
do
for
me
all
i
implore
you
to
do
for
me
is
to
keep
silence
forever
on
my
name
accident
has
made
me
break
a
vow
i
never
thought
but
to
keep
sacred
when
you
recognized
me
i
could
not
deny
myself
i
could
not
lie
to
you
but
for
god
sake
tell
none
of
what
has
passed
between
us
but
why
she
pursued
why
you
lie
under
this
charge
still
you
can
not
disprove
it
you
say
but
why
not
come
out
before
the
world
and
state
to
all
what
you
swear
now
to
me
and
claim
your
right
to
bear
your
father
honors
if
you
were
falsely
accused
there
must
have
been
some
guilty
in
your
stead
and
if
cease
for
pity
sake
forget
i
ever
told
you
i
was
guiltless
blot
my
memory
out
think
of
me
as
dead
as
i
have
been
till
your
eyes
called
me
back
to
life
think
that
i
am
branded
with
the
theft
of
your
brother
name
think
that
i
am
vile
and
shameless
and
fallen
as
the
lowest
wretch
that
pollutes
this
army
think
of
me
as
what
you
will
but
not
as
innocent
the
words
broke
out
in
a
torrent
from
him
bearing
down
with
them
all
his
as
the
rush
of
waters
bears
away
all
barriers
that
have
long
dammed
their
course
they
were
wild
passionate
incoherent
unlike
any
that
had
ever
passed
his
lips
or
been
poured
out
in
her
presence
he
felt
mad
with
the
struggle
that
tore
him
asunder
the
longing
to
tell
the
truth
to
her
though
he
should
never
after
look
upon
her
face
again
and
the
honor
which
bound
silence
on
him
for
sake
of
the
man
whom
he
had
sworn
under
no
temptation
to
dispossess
and
to
betray
she
heard
him
silently
with
her
grand
meditative
eyes
in
which
the
slow
tears
still
floated
fixed
upon
him
most
women
would
have
thought
that
conscious
guilt
spoke
in
the
violence
of
his
she
did
not
her
intuition
was
too
fine
her
sympathies
too
true
she
felt
that
he
feared
not
that
she
should
unjustly
think
him
guilty
but
that
she
should
justly
think
him
guiltless
she
knew
that
this
whatever
its
root
might
be
was
the
fear
of
the
stainless
not
of
the
criminal
life
i
hear
you
she
answered
him
gently
but
i
do
not
believe
you
even
against
yourself
the
man
whom
philip
loved
and
honored
never
sank
to
the
base
fraud
of
a
her
glorious
eyes
were
still
on
him
as
she
spoke
seeming
to
read
his
very
soul
under
that
glance
all
the
manhood
all
the
race
all
the
pride
and
the
love
and
the
courage
within
him
refused
to
bear
in
her
sight
the
shame
of
an
alien
crime
and
rose
in
revolt
to
fling
off
the
bondage
that
forced
him
to
stand
as
a
criminal
before
the
noble
gaze
of
this
woman
his
eyes
met
hers
full
and
rested
on
them
without
wavering
his
head
was
raised
and
his
carriage
had
a
fearless
dignity
no
i
was
innocent
but
in
honor
i
must
bear
the
yoke
that
i
took
on
me
long
ago
in
honor
i
can
never
give
you
or
any
living
soul
the
proof
that
this
crime
was
not
mine
i
thought
that
i
should
go
to
my
grave
without
any
ever
hearing
of
the
years
that
i
have
passed
in
africa
without
any
ever
learning
the
name
i
used
to
bear
as
it
is
all
i
can
ask
is
now
to
be
his
voice
fell
before
the
last
words
and
faltered
over
them
it
was
bitter
to
ask
only
for
oblivion
from
the
woman
whom
he
loved
with
all
the
strength
of
a
sudden
passion
born
in
utter
hopelessness
the
woman
whose
smile
whose
beauty
whose
love
might
even
possibly
have
been
won
as
his
own
in
the
future
if
he
could
have
claimed
his
birthright
so
bitter
that
rather
than
have
spoken
those
words
of
resignation
he
would
have
been
led
out
by
a
platoon
of
his
own
soldiery
and
shot
in
the
autumn
sunlight
beside
rake
grave
you
ask
what
will
not
be
mine
to
give
she
answered
him
while
a
great
weariness
stole
through
her
own
words
for
she
was
bewildered
and
pained
and
oppressed
with
a
new
strange
sense
of
helplessness
before
this
man
nameless
suffering
remember
i
knew
you
so
well
in
my
earliest
years
and
you
are
so
dear
to
the
one
dearest
to
me
it
will
not
be
possible
to
forget
such
a
meeting
as
this
silence
of
course
you
can
command
from
me
if
you
insist
on
it
but
i
command
nothing
from
you
but
i
implore
it
it
is
the
sole
mercy
you
can
show
never
for
god
sake
speak
of
me
to
your
brother
or
to
do
you
so
mistrust
philip
affection
no
it
is
because
i
trust
it
too
too
entirely
to
do
what
to
deal
it
fruitless
pain
as
you
love
him
as
you
pity
me
pray
that
he
and
i
never
meet
but
why
if
all
this
could
be
cleared
it
never
can
the
baffled
sense
of
impotence
against
the
granite
wall
of
some
immovable
calamity
which
she
had
felt
before
came
on
her
she
had
been
always
used
to
be
obeyed
followed
and
caressed
to
see
obstacles
crumble
difficulties
disappear
before
her
wish
she
had
not
been
tried
by
any
sorrow
save
when
a
mere
child
still
she
felt
the
pain
of
her
father
death
she
had
been
lapped
in
softest
luxury
crowned
with
easiest
victory
the
sense
that
here
there
was
a
tragedy
whose
meaning
she
could
not
reach
that
there
was
here
a
fate
that
she
could
not
change
or
soften
brought
a
strange
unfamiliar
feeling
of
weakness
before
a
hopeless
and
cruel
doom
that
was
no
more
to
be
altered
by
her
will
than
the
huge
bare
rocks
of
africa
out
yonder
in
the
glare
of
noon
were
to
be
lifted
by
her
hand
for
she
knew
that
this
man
who
made
so
light
of
perils
that
would
have
chilled
many
to
the
soul
in
terror
and
who
bore
so
quiet
and
serene
a
habit
beneath
the
sharpest
stings
and
hardest
blows
of
his
adversities
would
not
speak
thus
without
full
warrant
would
not
consign
himself
to
this
renunciation
of
every
hope
unless
he
were
compelled
to
it
by
a
destiny
from
which
there
was
no
escape
she
was
silent
some
moments
her
eyes
resting
on
him
with
that
grave
and
luminous
regard
which
no
man
had
ever
changed
to
one
more
tender
or
less
calmly
contemplative
he
had
risen
again
and
paced
to
and
fro
the
narrow
chamber
his
head
bent
down
his
chest
rising
and
falling
with
the
labored
quickened
breath
he
had
thought
that
the
hour
in
which
his
brother
ingratitude
had
pierced
his
heart
had
been
the
greatest
suffering
he
had
ever
known
or
ever
could
know
but
a
greater
had
waited
on
him
here
in
the
fate
to
which
the
jeweled
toy
that
he
had
lifted
from
the
water
had
accidentally
led
him
not
dreaming
to
what
he
came
lord
royallieu
she
said
softly
at
length
while
she
rose
and
moved
toward
him
the
scarlet
of
the
trailing
cashmeres
gathering
dark
ruby
lights
in
them
as
they
caught
sun
and
shadow
and
at
the
old
name
uttered
in
her
voice
he
started
and
turned
and
looked
at
her
as
though
he
saw
some
ghost
of
his
past
life
rise
from
its
grave
why
look
at
me
so
she
pursued
ere
he
could
speak
act
how
you
will
you
can
not
change
the
fact
that
you
are
the
bearer
of
your
father
title
so
long
as
you
live
your
brother
berkeley
can
never
take
it
legally
you
may
be
a
chasseur
of
the
african
army
but
none
the
less
are
you
a
peer
of
what
means
that
he
muttered
why
tell
me
that
i
have
said
i
am
dead
leave
me
buried
here
and
let
him
enjoy
what
he
may
what
he
but
this
is
folly
madness
no
it
is
neither
i
have
told
you
i
should
stand
as
a
felon
in
the
eyes
of
the
english
law
i
should
have
no
civil
rights
the
greatest
mercy
fate
can
show
me
is
to
let
me
remain
forgotten
here
it
will
not
be
long
most
likely
before
i
am
thrust
into
the
african
sand
to
rot
like
that
brave
soul
out
yonder
berkeley
will
be
the
lawful
holder
of
the
title
then
leave
him
in
peace
and
possession
he
spoke
the
words
out
to
the
end
calmly
and
with
unfaltering
resolve
but
she
saw
the
great
dews
gather
on
his
temples
where
silver
threads
were
just
glistening
among
the
bright
richness
of
his
hair
and
she
heard
the
short
low
convulsive
breathing
with
which
his
chest
heaved
as
he
spoke
she
stood
close
beside
him
and
gazed
once
more
full
in
his
eyes
while
the
sweet
imperious
cadence
of
her
voice
answered
him
there
is
more
than
i
know
of
here
either
you
are
the
greatest
madman
or
the
most
generous
man
that
ever
lived
you
choose
to
guard
your
own
secret
i
will
not
seek
to
persuade
it
from
you
but
tell
me
one
thing
why
do
you
thus
abjure
your
rights
permit
a
false
charge
to
rest
on
you
and
consign
yourself
forever
to
this
cruel
agony
his
lips
shook
under
his
beard
as
he
answered
her
because
i
can
do
no
less
in
honor
for
god
sake
do
not
you
tempt
me
forgive
me
she
said
after
a
long
pause
i
will
never
ask
you
that
she
could
honor
honor
too
well
and
too
well
divine
all
that
he
suffered
for
its
sake
ever
to
become
his
temptress
in
bidding
him
forsake
it
yet
with
a
certain
weariness
a
certain
dread
wholly
unfamiliar
to
her
she
realized
that
what
he
had
chosen
was
the
choice
not
of
his
present
or
of
his
future
it
could
have
no
concern
for
her
save
that
long
years
ago
he
had
been
the
friend
of
her
relative
whether
or
no
he
remained
lost
to
all
the
world
under
the
unknown
name
of
a
french
chasseur
and
yet
it
smote
her
with
a
certain
dull
unanalyzed
pain
it
gave
her
a
certain
emotion
of
powerlessness
and
of
hopelessness
to
realize
that
he
would
remain
all
his
years
through
until
an
arab
shot
should
set
him
free
under
this
bondage
of
renunciation
beneath
this
yoke
of
service
she
stood
silent
long
leaning
against
the
oval
of
the
casement
with
the
sun
shed
over
the
glowing
cashmeres
that
swept
round
her
he
stood
apart
in
silence
also
what
could
he
say
to
her
his
whole
heart
longed
with
an
unutterable
longing
to
tell
her
the
truth
and
bid
her
be
his
judge
between
him
and
his
duty
but
his
promise
hung
on
him
like
a
leaden
weight
he
must
remain
speechless
and
leave
her
for
doubt
to
assail
her
and
for
scorn
to
follow
it
in
her
thoughts
of
him
if
so
they
would
heavy
as
had
been
the
curse
to
him
of
that
one
hour
in
which
honor
had
forbade
him
to
compromise
a
woman
reputation
and
old
tenderness
had
forbade
him
to
betray
a
brother
sin
he
had
never
paid
so
heavy
a
price
for
his
act
as
that
which
he
paid
now
through
the
yellow
sunlight
without
over
the
barren
plains
in
the
distance
there
approached
three
riders
accompanied
by
a
small
escort
of
spahis
with
their
crimson
burnous
floating
in
the
autumnal
wind
she
started
and
turned
to
him
it
is
philip
he
is
coming
for
me
from
your
camp
his
eyes
strained
through
the
ah
god
i
can
not
meet
him
i
have
not
strength
you
do
not
know
i
know
how
well
he
loved
not
better
than
i
him
but
i
can
not
i
dare
not
unless
i
could
meet
him
as
we
never
shall
meet
upon
earth
we
must
be
apart
forever
for
heaven
sake
promise
me
never
to
speak
my
name
i
promise
until
you
release
and
you
can
believe
me
innocent
still
in
face
of
all
she
stretched
her
hands
to
him
once
more
i
believe
for
i
know
what
you
once
great
burning
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
upon
her
hands
as
he
bent
over
them
god
bless
you
you
were
an
angel
of
pity
to
me
in
your
childhood
in
your
womanhood
you
give
me
the
only
mercy
i
have
known
since
the
last
day
you
looked
upon
my
face
we
shall
be
far
sundered
forever
may
i
come
to
you
once
more
she
paused
in
hesitation
and
in
thought
a
while
while
for
the
first
time
in
all
her
years
a
tremulous
tenderness
passed
over
her
face
she
felt
an
unutterable
pity
for
this
man
and
for
his
doom
then
she
drew
her
hands
gently
away
from
him
yes
i
will
see
you
so
much
concession
to
such
a
prayer
venetia
corona
had
never
before
given
he
could
not
command
his
voice
to
answer
but
he
bowed
low
before
her
as
before
an
empress
another
moment
and
she
was
alone
she
stood
looking
out
at
the
wide
level
country
beyond
with
the
glare
of
the
white
strong
light
and
the
red
burnous
of
the
glowing
against
the
blue
but
cloudless
sky
she
thought
that
she
must
be
dreaming
some
fantastic
story
born
of
these
desert
solitudes
yet
her
eyes
were
dim
with
tears
and
her
heart
ached
with
woe
doubt
of
him
never
came
to
her
but
there
was
a
vague
terrible
pathos
in
the
mystery
of
his
fate
that
oppressed
her
with
a
weight
of
future
evil
unknown
and
unmeasured
is
he
a
madman
she
mused
if
not
he
is
a
martyr
one
of
the
greatest
that
ever
suffered
unknown
to
other
in
the
coolness
of
the
late
evening
in
the
court
of
the
caravanserai
her
brother
and
his
friends
lounged
with
her
and
the
two
ladies
of
their
touring
and
sketching
party
while
they
drank
their
sherbet
and
talked
of
the
gerome
colors
of
the
place
and
watched
the
flame
of
the
afterglow
burn
out
and
threw
millet
to
the
doves
and
pigeons
straying
at
their
feet
my
dear
venetia
cried
the
seraph
carelessly
tossing
handfuls
of
grain
to
the
eager
birds
i
inquired
for
your
that
fellow
victor
but
i
failed
to
see
him
for
he
had
been
sent
on
an
expedition
shortly
after
i
reached
the
camp
they
tell
me
he
is
a
fine
soldier
but
by
what
the
marquis
said
i
fear
he
is
but
a
handsome
blackguard
and
africa
after
all
may
be
his
fittest
she
gave
a
bend
of
her
head
to
show
she
heard
him
stroking
the
soft
throat
of
a
little
dove
that
had
settled
on
the
bench
beside
her
there
is
a
charming
little
creature
there
a
little
cigarette
they
call
her
who
is
in
love
with
him
i
fancy
such
a
picturesque
child
swears
like
a
trooper
too
continued
he
who
was
now
duke
of
lyonnesse
by
the
way
is
berkeley
gone
left
what
for
where
to
i
was
not
interested
to
ah
you
never
liked
him
odd
enough
to
leave
without
reason
or
apology
he
had
his
reasons
and
made
his
apology
to
you
oh
yes
her
brother
looked
at
her
earnestly
there
was
a
care
upon
her
face
new
to
him
are
you
well
my
darling
he
asked
her
has
the
sun
been
too
hot
or
la
bise
too
cold
for
you
she
rose
and
gathered
her
cashmeres
about
her
and
smiled
somewhat
wearily
her
adieu
to
him

chapter
xxxiii
the
gift
of
the
cross
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
algerian
autumnal
days
shone
over
the
great
camp
in
the
south
the
war
was
almost
at
an
end
for
a
time
the
arabs
were
defeated
and
driven
desertwards
hostilities
irksome
harassing
and
annoying
like
all
guerrilla
warfare
would
long
continue
but
peace
was
virtually
established
and
zaraila
had
been
the
chief
glory
that
had
been
added
by
the
campaign
to
the
flag
of
imperial
france
the
kites
and
the
vultures
had
left
the
bare
bones
by
thousands
to
bleach
upon
the
sands
and
the
hillocks
of
brown
earth
rose
in
crowds
where
those
more
cared
for
in
death
had
been
hastily
thrust
beneath
the
brown
crust
of
the
earth
the
dead
had
received
their
portion
of
reward
in
the
jackal
teeth
in
the
crow
beak
in
the
worm
caress
and
the
living
received
theirs
in
this
glorious
glittering
autumn
morning
when
the
breath
of
winter
made
the
air
crisp
and
cool
but
the
ardent
noon
still
lighted
with
its
furnace
glow
the
hillside
and
the
plain
the
whole
of
the
army
of
the
south
was
drawn
up
on
the
immense
level
of
the
plateau
to
witness
the
presentation
of
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
it
was
full
noon
the
sun
shone
without
a
single
cloud
on
the
deep
sparkling
azure
of
the
skies
the
troops
stretched
east
and
west
north
and
south
formed
up
in
three
sides
of
one
vast
massive
square
the
battalions
of
zouaves
and
of
zephyrs
the
brigade
of
chasseurs
the
squadrons
of
spahis
the
regiments
of
tirailleurs
and
turcos
the
batteries
of
flying
artillery
were
all
massed
there
reassembled
from
the
various
camps
and
stations
of
the
southern
provinces
to
do
honor
to
the
day
to
do
honor
in
especial
to
one
by
whom
the
glory
of
the
tricolor
had
been
saved
unstained
the
red
white
and
blue
of
the
standards
the
brass
of
the
eagle
guidons
the
gray
tossed
manes
of
the
chargers
the
fierce
swarthy
faces
of
the
soldiery
the
scarlet
of
the
spahis
cloaks
and
the
snowy
folds
of
the
turbans
the
shine
of
the
sloped
lances
and
the
glisten
of
the
carbine
barrels
fused
together
in
one
sea
of
blended
color
flashed
into
a
million
prismatic
hues
against
the
somber
shadow
of
the
sunburned
plains
and
the
clear
blue
of
the
skies
it
had
been
a
sanguinary
fruitless
cruel
campaign
it
had
availed
nothing
except
to
drive
the
arabs
away
from
some
hundred
leagues
of
useless
and
profitless
soil
hundreds
of
french
soldiers
had
fallen
by
disease
and
drought
and
dysentery
as
well
as
by
shot
and
saber
and
were
unrecorded
save
on
the
books
of
the
bureaus
unlamented
save
perhaps
in
some
little
nestling
hamlet
among
the
great
green
woods
of
normandy
or
some
wooden
hut
among
the
olives
and
the
vines
of
provence
where
some
woman
toiling
till
sunset
among
the
fields
or
praying
before
some
wayside
saint
stone
niche
would
give
a
thought
to
the
and
devouring
desert
that
had
drawn
down
beneath
its
sands
the
head
that
used
to
lie
upon
her
bosom
cradled
as
a
child
or
caressed
as
a
lover
but
the
drums
rolled
out
their
long
deep
thunder
over
the
water
and
the
standards
fluttered
gayly
in
the
breeze
blowing
from
the
west
and
the
clear
full
music
of
the
french
bands
echoed
away
to
the
dim
distant
terrible
south
where
the
and
the
had
murdered
their
bravest
and
best
and
the
army
was
en
fete
en
fete
for
it
did
honor
to
its
darling
cigarette
received
the
cross
mounted
on
her
own
little
bright
bay
with
tricolor
ribbons
flying
from
his
bridle
and
among
the
glossy
fringes
of
his
mane
the
little
one
rode
among
her
spahis
a
scarlet
kepi
was
set
on
her
thick
silken
curls
a
tricolor
sash
was
knotted
round
her
waist
her
was
slung
on
her
left
hip
her
pistols
thrust
in
her
ceinturon
and
a
light
carbine
held
in
her
hand
with
the
resting
on
her
foot
with
the
sun
on
her
childlike
brunette
face
her
eyes
flashing
like
brown
diamonds
in
the
light
and
her
marvelous
horsemanship
showing
its
skill
in
a
hundred
daring
tricks
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
had
come
hither
among
her
warriors
whose
red
robes
surrounded
her
like
a
sea
of
blood
and
on
a
sea
of
blood
she
the
child
of
war
had
floated
never
sinking
in
that
awful
flood
but
buoyant
ever
above
its
darkest
waves
catching
ever
some
ray
of
sunlight
upon
her
fair
young
head
and
being
oftentimes
like
a
star
of
hope
to
those
over
whom
its
dreaded
waters
closed
therefore
they
loved
her
these
grim
slaughterous
and
lustful
warriors
to
whom
no
other
thing
of
womanhood
was
sacred
by
whom
in
their
wrath
or
their
crime
no
friend
and
no
brother
was
spared
whose
law
was
license
and
whose
mercy
was
murder
they
loved
her
these
brutes
whose
greed
was
like
the
tiger
whose
hate
was
like
the
devouring
flame
and
any
who
should
have
harmed
a
single
lock
of
her
curling
hair
would
have
had
the
spears
of
the
african
mussulmans
buried
by
the
score
in
his
body
they
loved
her
with
the
one
fond
triumphant
love
these
vultures
of
the
army
ever
knew
and
they
gloried
in
her
with
fierce
passionate
delight
she
was
to
her
wild
wolves
of
africa
what
jeanne
of
vaucouleurs
was
to
her
brethren
of
france
and
today
was
the
crown
of
her
young
life
in
the
fair
slight
girlish
body
of
the
there
lived
a
courage
as
daring
as
danton
a
patriotism
as
pure
as
vergniaud
a
soul
as
aspiring
as
napoleon
untaught
untutored
uninspired
by
poet
words
or
patriot
bidding
spontaneous
as
the
rising
and
the
blossoming
of
some
flower
there
was
in
this
child
of
the
battle
the
spirit
of
genius
the
desire
to
live
and
to
die
greatly
to
be
forever
a
beloved
tradition
in
the
army
of
her
country
to
have
her
name
remembered
in
the
to
be
once
shrined
in
the
love
and
honor
of
france
cigarette
full
of
the
boundless
joys
of
life
that
knew
no
weakness
and
no
pain
strong
as
the
young
goat
happy
as
the
young
lamb
careless
as
the
young
flower
tossing
on
the
summer
breeze
cigarette
would
have
died
contentedly
and
now
living
some
measure
of
this
desire
had
been
fulfilled
to
her
some
breath
of
this
imperishable
glory
had
passed
over
her
france
had
heard
the
story
of
zaraila
from
the
throne
a
message
had
been
passed
to
her
what
was
far
beyond
all
else
to
her
her
own
army
of
africa
had
crowned
her
and
thanked
her
and
adored
her
as
with
one
voice
and
wheresoever
she
passed
the
wild
cheers
rang
through
the
roar
of
musketry
as
through
the
silence
of
sunny
air
and
throughout
the
regiments
every
sword
would
have
sprung
from
its
scabbard
in
her
defense
if
she
had
but
lifted
her
hand
and
said
one
word
zaraila
the
army
looked
on
her
with
delight
now
in
all
that
mute
still
immovable
mass
that
stretched
out
so
far
in
such
gorgeous
array
there
was
not
one
man
whose
eyes
did
not
turn
on
her
whose
pride
did
not
center
in
her
their
little
one
who
was
so
wholly
theirs
and
who
had
been
under
the
shadow
of
their
flag
ever
since
the
curls
so
dark
now
had
been
yellow
as
wheat
in
her
infancy
there
was
not
one
in
all
those
hosts
whose
eyes
did
not
turn
on
her
with
gratitude
and
reverence
and
delight
in
her
as
their
own
not
one
except
where
her
own
keen
rapid
glance
as
the
hawk
lighted
on
the
squadrons
of
the
chasseurs
and
found
among
their
ranks
one
face
grave
weary
meditative
with
a
gaze
that
seemed
looking
far
away
from
the
glittering
scene
to
a
grave
that
lay
unseen
leagues
beyond
behind
the
rocky
ridge
he
is
thinking
of
the
dead
man
not
of
me
thought
cigarette
and
the
first
taint
of
bitterness
entered
into
her
cup
of
joy
and
triumph
as
such
bitterness
enters
into
most
cups
that
are
drunk
by
human
lips
a
whole
army
was
thinking
of
her
and
of
her
alone
and
there
was
a
void
in
her
heart
a
thorn
in
her
crown
because
one
among
that
mighty
mass
one
only
gave
her
presence
little
heed
but
thought
rather
of
a
lonely
tomb
among
the
desolation
of
the
plains
but
she
had
scarce
time
even
for
that
flash
of
pain
to
quiver
in
impotent
impatience
through
her
the
trumpets
sounded
the
salvoes
of
artillery
pealed
out
the
lances
and
the
swords
were
carried
up
in
salute
on
the
ground
rode
the
marshal
of
france
who
represented
the
imperial
will
and
presence
surrounded
by
his
staff
by
generals
of
division
and
brigade
by
officers
of
rank
and
by
some
few
civilian
riders
an
aid
galloped
up
to
her
where
she
stood
with
the
corps
of
her
spahis
and
gave
her
his
orders
the
little
one
nodded
carelessly
and
touched
with
the
prick
of
the
spur
like
lightning
the
animal
bounded
forth
from
the
ranks
rearing
and
plunging
and
swerving
from
side
to
side
while
his
rider
with
exquisite
grace
and
address
kept
her
seat
like
the
little
that
she
was
and
with
a
thousand
curves
and
bounds
cantered
down
the
line
of
the
gathered
troops
with
the
west
wind
blowing
from
the
sea
and
fanning
her
bright
cheeks
till
they
wore
the
soft
scarlet
flush
of
the
glowing
japonica
flower
and
all
down
the
ranks
a
low
hoarse
strange
longing
murmur
went
the
buzz
of
the
voices
which
but
that
discipline
suppressed
them
would
have
broken
out
in
worshiping
acclamations
as
carelessly
as
though
she
reined
up
before
the
cafe
door
of
the
as
de
pique
she
arrested
her
horse
before
the
great
marshal
who
was
the
impersonation
of
authority
and
put
her
hand
up
in
salute
with
her
saucy
wayward
laugh
he
was
the
impersonation
of
that
vast
silent
awful
irresponsible
power
which
under
the
name
of
the
second
empire
stretched
its
hand
of
iron
across
the
sea
and
forced
the
soldiers
of
france
down
into
nameless
graves
with
the
desert
sand
choking
their
mouths
but
he
was
no
more
to
cigarette
than
any
that
might
be
present
she
had
all
the
contempt
for
the
laws
of
rank
of
your
thorough
inborn
democrat
all
the
gay
insouciant
indifference
to
station
of
the
really
free
and
untrammeled
nature
and
in
her
sight
a
dying
soldier
lying
quietly
in
a
ditch
to
perish
of
without
a
word
or
a
moan
was
greater
than
all
the
marshals
glittering
in
their
stars
and
orders
as
for
impressing
her
or
hoping
to
impress
her
with
rank
pooh
you
might
as
well
have
bid
the
sailing
clouds
pause
in
their
floating
passage
because
they
came
between
royalty
and
the
sun
all
the
sovereigns
of
europe
would
have
awed
cigarette
not
one
whit
more
than
a
gathering
of
muleteers
allied
sovereigns
bah
she
would
have
said
what
did
that
mean
in
a
chorus
of
magpies
chattering
over
one
stricken
eagle
so
she
reined
up
before
the
marshal
and
his
staff
and
the
few
great
personages
whom
algeria
could
bring
around
them
as
indifferently
as
she
had
many
a
time
reined
up
before
a
knot
of
grim
turcos
smoking
under
a
he
was
nothing
to
her
it
was
her
army
that
crowned
her
nevertheless
despite
her
gay
contempt
for
rank
her
heart
beat
fast
under
its
packet
as
she
reined
up
etoile
and
saluted
in
that
hot
clear
sun
all
the
eyes
of
that
immense
host
were
fastened
on
her
and
the
hour
of
her
longing
desire
was
come
at
last
france
had
recognized
that
she
had
done
greatly
there
was
a
group
before
her
large
and
brilliant
but
at
them
cigarette
never
looked
what
she
saw
were
the
faces
of
her
children
of
men
who
in
the
majority
were
old
enough
to
be
her
grandsires
who
had
been
with
her
through
so
many
darksome
hours
and
whose
black
and
rugged
features
lightened
and
grew
tender
whenever
they
looked
upon
their
little
one
for
the
moment
she
felt
giddy
with
sweet
fiery
joy
they
were
here
to
behold
her
thanked
in
the
name
of
france
the
marshal
in
advance
of
all
his
staff
doffed
his
plumed
hat
and
bowed
to
his
as
he
faced
her
he
knew
her
well
by
sight
this
pretty
child
of
his
army
of
africa
who
had
before
then
suppressed
mutiny
like
a
veteran
and
led
the
charge
like
a
murat
this
kitten
with
a
lion
heart
this
with
an
eagle
swoop
mademoiselle
he
commenced
while
his
voice
well
skilled
to
such
work
echoed
to
the
farthest
end
of
the
long
lines
of
troops
i
have
the
honor
to
discharge
the
happiest
duty
of
my
life
in
conveying
to
you
the
expression
of
the
emperor
approval
of
your
noble
conduct
in
the
present
campaign
i
express
the
sentiments
of
the
whole
army
your
action
on
the
day
of
zaraila
was
as
brilliant
in
conception
as
it
was
great
in
execution
and
the
courage
you
displayed
was
only
equaled
by
your
patriotism
may
the
soldiers
of
many
wars
remember
and
emulate
you
in
the
name
of
france
i
thank
you
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
i
bring
to
you
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
as
the
brief
and
soldierly
words
rolled
down
the
ranks
of
the
listening
regiments
he
stooped
forward
from
the
saddle
and
fastened
the
red
ribbon
on
her
breast
while
from
the
whole
gathered
mass
watching
hearing
waiting
breathlessly
to
give
their
tribute
of
applause
to
their
darling
also
a
great
shout
rose
as
with
one
voice
strong
full
echoing
over
and
over
again
across
the
plains
in
thunder
that
joined
her
name
with
the
name
of
france
and
of
napoleon
and
hurled
it
upward
in
fierce
tumultuous
idolatrous
love
to
those
cruel
cloudless
skies
that
shone
above
the
dead
she
was
their
child
their
treasure
their
idol
their
young
leader
in
war
their
young
angel
in
suffering
she
was
all
their
own
knowing
with
them
one
common
mother
france
honor
to
her
was
honor
to
them
they
gloried
with
heart
and
soul
in
this
bright
young
fearless
life
that
had
been
among
them
ever
since
her
infant
feet
had
waded
through
the
blood
of
and
her
infant
lips
had
laughed
to
see
the
tricolor
float
in
the
sun
above
the
smoke
of
battle
and
as
she
heard
her
face
became
very
pale
her
large
eyes
grew
dim
and
very
soft
her
mirthful
mouth
trembled
with
the
pain
of
a
too
intense
joy
she
lifted
her
head
and
all
the
unutterable
love
she
bore
her
country
and
her
people
thrilled
through
the
music
of
her
voice
francais
that
was
all
she
said
in
that
one
word
of
their
common
nationality
she
spoke
alike
to
the
marshal
of
the
empire
and
to
the
conscript
of
the
ranks
francais
that
one
title
made
them
all
equal
in
her
sight
whoever
claimed
it
was
honored
in
her
eyes
and
was
precious
to
her
heart
and
when
she
answered
them
that
it
was
nothing
this
thing
which
they
glorified
in
her
she
answered
but
what
seemed
the
simple
truth
in
her
code
she
would
have
thought
it
nothing
to
have
perished
by
shot
or
steel
or
flame
in
torture
for
that
one
fair
sake
of
france
vain
in
all
else
and
to
all
else
wayward
here
she
was
docile
and
submissive
as
the
most
patient
child
here
she
deemed
the
greatest
and
the
hardest
thing
that
she
could
ever
do
far
less
than
all
that
she
would
willingly
have
done
and
as
she
looked
upon
the
host
whose
thousand
and
ten
thousand
voices
rang
up
to
the
noonday
sun
in
her
homage
and
in
hers
alone
a
light
like
a
glory
beamed
upon
her
face
that
for
once
was
white
and
still
and
very
grave
none
who
saw
her
face
then
ever
forgot
that
look
in
that
moment
she
touched
the
full
sweetness
of
a
proud
and
pure
ambition
attained
and
possessed
in
all
its
intensity
in
all
its
perfect
splendor
in
that
moment
she
knew
that
divine
hour
which
born
of
a
people
love
and
of
the
impossible
desires
of
genius
in
its
youth
comes
to
so
few
human
lives
knew
that
which
was
known
to
the
young
napoleon
when
in
the
hot
hush
of
the
nights
of
july
france
welcomed
the
conqueror
of
italy
and
in
that
moment
there
was
an
intense
stillness
the
army
crowned
as
its
bravest
and
its
best
a
in
the
springtime
of
her
girlhood
then
cigarette
laid
her
hand
on
the
cross
that
had
been
the
dream
of
her
years
since
she
had
first
seen
the
brazen
glisten
of
the
eagles
above
her
wondering
eyes
of
infancy
and
loosened
it
from
above
her
heart
and
stretched
her
hand
out
with
it
to
the
great
chief
m
le
marshal
this
is
not
for
not
for
you
the
emperor
bestows
it
cigarette
saluted
with
her
left
hand
still
stretching
to
him
the
decoration
with
the
other
it
is
not
for
me
not
while
i
wear
it
unjustly
what
is
your
meaning
my
child
you
talk
strangely
the
gifts
of
the
empire
are
not
given
no
and
they
shall
not
be
given
unfairly
the
color
had
flushed
back
bright
and
radiant
to
her
cheeks
her
eyes
glanced
with
their
old
daring
her
contemptuous
careless
eloquence
returned
and
her
voice
echoed
every
note
distinct
as
the
notes
of
a
down
the
ranks
of
the
listening
soldiery
hark
you
the
emperor
sends
me
this
cross
france
thanks
me
the
army
applauds
me
well
i
thank
them
one
and
all
cigarette
was
never
yet
ungrateful
it
is
the
sin
of
the
coward
but
i
say
i
will
not
take
what
is
unjustly
mine
and
this
preference
to
me
is
unjust
i
saved
the
day
at
zaraila
oh
ha
and
how
by
scampering
fast
on
my
mare
and
asking
for
a
squadron
or
two
of
my
spahis
that
was
all
if
i
had
not
done
so
much
i
a
soldier
of
africa
why
i
should
have
deserved
to
have
been
shot
like
a
cat
bah
should
i
not
it
was
not
i
who
saved
the
battle
who
was
it
it
was
a
chasseur
i
tell
you
what
did
he
do
why
this
when
his
officers
were
all
gone
down
he
rallied
and
gathered
his
handful
of
men
and
held
the
ground
with
them
all
through
the
day
two
four
six
eight
ten
hours
in
the
scorch
of
the
sun
the
arbicos
even
were
forced
to
see
that
was
grand
they
offered
him
life
if
he
would
yield
all
his
answer
was
to
form
his
few
horsemen
into
line
as
well
as
he
could
for
the
slain
and
charge
a
last
charge
in
which
he
knew
not
one
of
his
troop
could
live
through
the
swarms
of
the
arabs
around
them
that
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
i
and
my
spahis
just
reached
him
in
time
then
who
is
it
that
saved
the
day
i
pray
you
i
who
just
ran
a
race
for
fun
and
came
in
at
the
of
the
thing
or
this
man
who
lived
the
whole
day
through
in
the
carnage
and
never
let
go
of
the
guidon
but
only
thought
how
to
die
greatly
i
tell
you
the
cross
is
his
and
not
mine
take
it
back
and
give
it
where
it
is
the
marshal
listened
half
amazed
half
amused
half
prepared
to
resent
the
insult
to
the
empire
and
to
discipline
half
disposed
to
award
that
submission
to
her
caprice
which
all
algeria
gave
to
cigarette
mademoiselle
he
said
with
a
grave
smile
the
honors
of
the
empire
are
not
to
be
treated
thus
but
who
is
this
man
for
whom
you
claim
so
much
who
is
he
echoed
cigarette
with
all
her
fiery
disdain
for
authority
ablaze
once
more
like
brandy
in
a
flame
oh
ha
napoleon
premier
would
not
have
left
his
marshals
to
ask
that
he
is
the
finest
soldier
in
africa
if
it
be
possible
for
one
to
be
finer
than
another
where
all
are
so
great
they
know
that
they
pick
him
out
for
all
the
dangerous
missions
but
the
black
hawk
hates
him
and
so
france
never
hears
the
truth
of
all
that
he
does
i
tell
you
if
the
emperor
had
seen
him
as
i
saw
him
on
the
field
of
zaraila
his
would
have
been
the
cross
and
not
you
are
generous
my
little
no
i
am
her
brave
eyes
glowed
in
the
sun
her
voice
rang
as
clear
as
a
bell
she
raised
her
head
proudly
and
glanced
down
the
line
of
her
army
she
was
just
that
was
the
one
virtue
in
cigarette
creed
without
which
you
were
poltroon
or
liar
or
both
she
alone
knew
what
neglect
what
indifference
what
unintentional
but
none
the
less
piercing
insults
she
had
to
avenge
she
alone
knew
of
that
pain
with
which
she
had
heard
the
name
of
his
patrician
rival
murmured
in
delirious
slumber
after
zaraila
she
alone
knew
of
that
negligent
caress
of
farewell
with
which
her
lips
had
been
touched
as
lightly
as
his
hand
caressed
a
horse
neck
or
a
bird
wing
but
these
did
not
weigh
with
her
one
instant
to
make
her
withhold
the
words
that
she
deemed
deserved
these
did
not
balance
against
him
one
instant
the
pique
and
the
pain
of
her
own
heart
in
opposition
to
the
due
of
his
courage
and
his
fortitude
cigarette
was
rightly
proud
of
her
immunity
from
the
weakness
of
her
sex
she
had
neither
meanness
nor
selfishness
the
marshal
listened
gravely
the
groups
around
him
smilingly
if
it
had
been
any
other
than
the
little
one
it
would
have
been
very
different
as
it
was
all
france
and
all
algeria
knew
cigarette
what
may
be
the
name
of
this
man
whom
you
praise
so
greatly
my
pretty
one
he
asked
her
that
i
can
not
tell
le
marshal
all
i
know
is
he
calls
himself
here
louis
ah
i
have
heard
much
of
him
a
fine
soldier
but
a
fine
soldier
without
a
interrupted
cigarette
with
rebellious
indifference
to
the
rank
of
the
great
man
she
corrected
unless
you
add
never
done
justice
by
his
chief
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
for
the
first
time
glanced
over
the
various
personages
who
were
mingled
among
the
staff
of
the
marshal
his
invited
guests
for
the
review
upon
the
plains
the
color
burned
more
duskily
in
her
cheek
her
eyes
glittered
with
hate
she
could
have
bitten
her
little
frank
witty
tongue
through
and
through
for
having
spoken
the
name
of
that
chasseur
who
was
yonder
out
of
earshot
where
the
of
his
squadrons
glistened
against
the
blue
skies
she
saw
a
face
which
though
seen
but
once
before
she
knew
instantly
again
the
face
of
and
she
saw
it
change
color
and
lose
its
beautiful
hue
and
grow
grave
and
troubled
as
the
last
words
passed
between
herself
and
the
french
marshal
ah
can
she
feel
wondered
cigarette
who
with
a
common
error
of
such
vehement
young
democrats
as
herself
always
thought
that
hearts
never
ached
in
the
patrician
order
and
thought
so
still
when
she
saw
the
listless
proud
tranquility
return
not
again
to
be
altered
over
the
perfect
features
that
she
watched
with
so
much
violent
instinctive
hate
did
she
heed
his
name
or
did
she
not
what
are
their
faces
in
that
order
only
alabaster
masks
mused
the
child
and
her
heart
sank
and
bitterness
mingled
with
her
joy
and
the
soul
that
had
a
moment
before
been
so
full
of
all
pure
and
noble
emotion
all
high
and
patriotic
and
idealic
thought
was
dulled
and
soiled
and
clogged
with
baser
passions
so
ever
do
unworthy
things
drag
the
loftier
nature
earthward
she
scarcely
heard
the
marshal
voice
as
it
addressed
her
with
a
kindly
indulgence
as
to
a
valued
soldier
and
a
spoiled
pet
in
one
have
no
fear
little
one
victor
claims
are
not
forgotten
though
we
may
await
our
own
time
to
investigate
and
reward
them
no
one
ever
served
the
empire
and
remained
unrewarded
for
yourself
wear
your
cross
proudly
it
glitters
above
not
only
the
bravest
but
the
most
generous
heart
in
the
none
had
ever
won
such
warm
words
from
the
redoubted
chief
whose
speech
was
commonly
rapid
and
stern
as
his
conduct
of
war
and
who
usually
recompensed
his
men
for
fine
service
rather
with
a
barrel
of
brandy
to
season
their
rations
than
with
speeches
of
military
eulogium
but
it
failed
to
give
delight
to
cigarette
she
felt
resting
upon
her
the
calm
gaze
of
those
brilliant
azure
eyes
and
she
felt
as
she
had
done
once
in
her
rhododendron
shelter
as
though
she
were
some
very
worthless
rough
rude
untaught
and
coarse
little
barbarian
who
was
at
best
but
fit
for
a
soldier
jest
and
a
soldier
riot
in
the
wild
license
of
the
barrack
room
or
the
campaigning
tent
it
was
only
the
eyes
of
this
woman
whom
he
loved
which
ever
had
the
power
to
awaken
that
humiliation
that
impatience
of
herself
that
consciousness
of
something
lost
and
irrevocable
which
moved
her
now
cigarette
was
proud
with
an
intense
pride
of
all
her
fiery
liberty
from
every
feminine
trammel
of
all
her
complete
immunity
from
every
scruple
and
every
fastidiousness
of
her
sex
but
for
once
within
sight
of
that
noble
and
haughty
beauty
a
poignant
cruel
wounding
sense
of
utter
inferiority
of
utter
debasement
possessed
and
weighed
down
her
lawless
and
indomitable
spirit
some
vague
weary
feeling
that
her
youth
was
fair
enough
in
the
sight
of
men
but
that
her
older
years
would
be
very
dark
very
terrible
came
on
her
even
in
this
hour
of
the
supreme
joy
the
supreme
triumph
of
her
life
even
her
buoyant
and
cloudless
nature
did
not
escape
that
mortal
doom
which
pursues
and
poisons
every
ambition
in
the
very
instant
of
its
full
fruition
the
doubt
the
pain
the
were
still
upon
her
as
she
saluted
once
again
and
paced
down
the
ranks
of
the
assembled
divisions
while
every
lance
was
carried
every
sword
lifted
every
bayonet
presented
to
the
order
as
she
went
greeted
as
though
she
were
an
empress
for
that
cross
which
glittered
on
her
heart
for
that
courage
wherewith
she
had
saved
the
tricolor
the
great
shouts
rent
the
air
the
clash
of
the
lowered
arms
saluted
her
the
drums
rolled
out
upon
the
air
the
bands
of
the
regiments
of
africa
broke
into
the
fiery
rapture
of
a
the
folds
of
the
flags
were
flung
out
wider
and
wider
on
the
breeze
men
gazed
on
her
with
tears
of
delight
upon
their
grizzled
lashes
and
young
boys
looked
at
her
as
the
children
of
france
once
gazed
upon
jeanne
where
cigarette
with
the
red
ribbon
on
her
breast
road
slowly
in
the
noonday
light
along
the
line
of
troops
it
was
the
paradise
of
which
she
had
dreamed
it
was
the
homage
of
the
army
she
adored
it
was
one
of
those
hours
in
which
life
is
transfigured
exalted
sublimated
into
a
divine
glory
by
the
pure
love
of
a
people
and
yet
in
that
instant
so
long
so
passionately
desired
the
doom
of
all
genius
was
hers
there
was
the
stealing
pain
of
a
weary
unrest
amid
the
sunlit
and
intoxicating
joy
of
satisfied
aspiration
the
eyes
of
venetia
corona
followed
her
with
something
of
ineffable
pity
poor
little
unsexed
child
she
thought
how
pretty
and
how
brave
she
is
and
how
true
to
him
the
seraph
beside
her
in
the
group
around
the
flagstaff
smiled
and
turned
to
her
i
said
that
little
amazon
was
in
love
with
this
fellow
victor
how
loyally
she
stood
up
for
him
but
i
dare
say
she
would
be
as
quick
to
send
a
bullet
through
him
if
he
should
ever
displease
why
where
there
is
so
much
courage
there
must
be
much
nobility
even
in
the
abandonment
of
such
a
life
as
ah
you
do
not
know
what
natures
are
she
would
die
for
him
just
now
very
likely
but
if
he
ever
forsake
her
she
will
be
quite
as
likely
to
run
her
dirk
through
forsake
her
what
is
he
to
her
there
was
a
certain
impatience
in
the
tone
and
something
of
contemptuous
disbelief
that
made
her
brother
look
at
her
in
wonder
what
on
earth
can
the
loves
of
a
camp
concern
her
he
thought
as
he
answered
nothing
that
i
know
of
but
this
charming
little
tigress
is
very
fond
of
him
by
the
way
can
you
point
the
man
out
to
me
i
am
curious
to
see
impossible
there
are
ten
thousand
faces
and
the
cavalry
squadrons
are
so
far
she
spoke
with
indifference
but
she
grew
a
little
pale
as
she
did
so
and
the
eyes
that
had
always
met
his
so
frankly
so
proudly
were
turned
from
him
he
saw
it
and
it
troubled
him
with
a
trouble
the
more
perplexed
that
he
could
assign
to
himself
no
reason
for
it
that
it
could
be
caused
by
any
interest
felt
for
a
chasseur
by
the
haughtiest
lady
in
all
europe
would
have
been
too
preposterous
and
too
insulting
a
supposition
for
it
ever
to
occur
to
him
and
he
did
not
dream
the
truth
the
truth
that
it
was
her
withholding
for
the
first
time
in
all
her
life
any
secret
from
him
which
caused
her
pain
that
it
was
the
fear
lest
he
should
learn
that
his
lost
friend
was
living
thus
which
haunted
her
with
that
unspoken
anxiety
they
were
traveling
here
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
seeing
the
military
operations
of
the
south
she
could
not
have
prevented
him
from
accepting
the
marshal
invitation
to
the
review
of
the
african
army
without
exciting
comment
and
interrogation
she
was
forced
to
let
events
take
their
own
course
and
shape
themselves
as
they
would
yet
an
apprehension
a
dread
that
she
could
hardly
form
into
distant
shape
pursued
her
it
weighed
on
her
with
an
infinite
oppression
this
story
which
she
alone
had
had
revealed
to
her
this
life
whose
martyrdom
she
alone
had
seen
and
whose
secret
even
she
could
not
divine
it
affected
her
more
powerfully
it
grieved
her
more
keenly
than
she
herself
knew
it
brought
her
close
for
the
only
time
in
her
experience
to
a
life
absolutely
without
a
hope
and
one
that
accepted
the
despair
of
such
a
destiny
with
silent
resignation
it
moved
her
as
nothing
less
as
nothing
feebler
or
of
more
common
type
could
ever
have
found
power
to
do
there
were
a
simplicity
and
a
greatness
in
the
mute
unpretentious
almost
unconscious
heroism
of
this
man
who
for
the
sheer
sake
of
that
which
he
deemed
the
need
of
honor
accepted
the
desolation
of
his
entire
future
which
attracted
her
as
nothing
else
had
ever
done
which
made
her
heart
ache
when
she
looked
at
the
glitter
of
the
squadrons
where
their
sloped
lances
glistened
in
the
sun
with
a
pang
that
she
had
never
felt
before
moreover
as
the
untutored
impulsive
young
heart
of
cigarette
had
felt
so
felt
the
cultured
mind
of
venetia
corona
that
this
man
exile
was
no
shame
but
some
great
sacrifice
a
sacrifice
whose
bitterness
smote
her
with
its
own
suffering
whose
mystery
wearied
her
with
its
own
perplexity
as
she
gazed
down
the
line
of
the
regiments
to
where
the
eagle
of
zaraila
gleamed
above
the
squadrons
of
the
chasseurs
he
in
his
place
among
those
squadrons
knew
her
though
so
far
distant
and
endured
the
deadliest
trial
of
patience
which
had
come
to
him
while
beneath
the
yoke
of
african
discipline
to
leave
his
place
was
to
incur
the
heaviest
punishment
yet
he
could
almost
have
risked
that
sentence
rather
than
wait
there
only
seven
days
had
gone
by
since
he
had
been
with
her
under
the
roof
of
the
caravanserai
but
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
these
days
had
aged
him
more
than
all
the
twelve
years
that
he
had
passed
upon
the
algerian
soil
he
was
thankful
that
the
enmity
of
his
relentless
chief
had
placed
such
shadow
of
evil
report
between
his
name
and
the
rewards
due
to
his
service
that
even
the
promised
recognition
of
his
brilliant
actions
at
zaraila
and
elsewhere
was
postponed
a
while
on
the
plea
of
investigation
he
was
thankful
that
the
honors
which
the
whole
army
expected
for
him
and
which
the
antagonism
of
chateauroy
would
soon
be
powerless
to
avert
any
longer
from
their
meet
bestowal
did
not
force
him
to
go
up
there
in
the
scorching
light
of
the
noon
and
take
those
honors
as
a
soldier
of
france
under
the
eyes
of
the
man
he
loved
of
the
woman
he
adored
as
it
was
he
sat
motionless
as
a
statue
in
his
saddle
and
never
looked
westward
to
where
the
tricolors
of
the
flagstaff
drooped
above
the
head
of
venetia
corona
thus
he
never
heard
the
gallant
words
spoken
in
his
behalf
by
the
loyal
lips
that
he
had
not
cared
to
caress
as
she
passed
down
the
ranks
indeed
he
saw
and
smiled
on
his
little
champion
but
the
smile
had
only
a
weary
kindness
of
recognition
in
it
and
it
wounded
cigarette
more
than
though
he
had
struck
her
through
the
breast
with
his
lance
the
moment
that
he
had
dreaded
came
the
troops
broke
up
and
marched
past
the
representative
of
their
empire
the
cavalry
at
the
head
of
the
divisions
he
passed
among
the
rest
he
raised
his
lance
so
that
it
hid
his
features
as
much
as
its
slender
shaft
could
do
the
fair
and
noble
face
on
which
his
glance
flashed
was
very
pale
and
very
grave
the
one
beside
her
was
sunny
and
frank
and
unchanged
by
the
years
that
had
drifted
by
and
its
azure
eyes
so
like
her
own
sweeping
over
the
masses
with
all
the
swift
keen
appreciation
of
a
military
glance
were
so
eagerly
noting
carriage
accouterment
harness
horses
that
they
never
once
fell
upon
the
single
soldier
whose
heart
so
unutterably
longed
for
even
while
it
dreaded
his
recognition
venetia
gave
a
low
quick
breath
of
mingled
pain
and
relief
as
the
last
of
the
chasseurs
passed
by
the
seraph
started
and
turned
his
head
my
darling
are
you
not
well
perfectly
you
do
not
look
so
and
you
forgot
now
to
point
me
out
this
special
trooper
i
forgot
him
he
goes
there
the
tenth
from
her
brother
looked
it
was
too
late
he
is
taller
than
the
others
that
is
all
i
can
see
now
that
his
back
is
turned
i
will
seek
him
out
when
do
no
such
thing
and
why
it
was
your
own
request
that
i
inquired
think
me
changeable
as
you
will
do
nothing
to
seek
him
to
inquire
for
him
but
why
a
man
who
at
zaraila
never
mind
do
not
let
it
be
said
you
notice
a
chasseur
at
my
the
color
flushed
her
face
as
she
spoke
it
was
with
the
scorn
the
hatred
of
this
shadow
of
an
untruth
with
which
she
for
the
sole
time
in
life
soiled
her
lips
he
noting
it
shook
himself
restlessly
in
his
saddle
if
he
had
not
known
her
to
be
the
noblest
and
the
haughtiest
of
all
the
imperial
women
who
had
crowned
his
house
with
their
beauty
and
their
honor
he
could
have
believed
that
some
interest
degrading
as
disgrace
moved
her
toward
this
foreign
trooper
and
caused
her
altered
wishes
and
her
silence
as
it
was
so
much
insult
to
her
as
would
have
existed
in
the
mere
thought
was
impossible
to
him
yet
it
left
him
annoyed
and
vaguely
disquieted
the
subject
did
not
wholly
fade
from
his
mind
throughout
the
entertainments
that
succeeded
to
the
military
inspection
in
the
great
white
tent
glistening
with
gilded
bees
and
brightened
with
tricolor
standards
which
the
ingenuity
of
the
soldiers
of
the
administration
had
reared
as
though
by
magic
amid
the
barrenness
of
the
country
and
in
which
the
skill
of
camp
cooks
served
up
a
delicate
banquet
the
scene
was
very
picturesque
and
all
the
more
so
for
the
widespread
changing
panorama
without
the
canvas
city
of
the
camp
it
was
chiefly
designed
to
pleasure
the
great
lady
who
had
come
so
far
southward
all
the
resources
which
could
be
employed
were
exhausted
to
make
the
occasion
memorable
and
worthy
of
the
dignity
of
the
guests
whom
the
viceroy
of
the
empire
delighted
to
honor
yet
she
seated
there
on
his
right
hand
where
the
rich
skins
and
cashmeres
and
carpets
were
strewn
on
a
dais
saw
in
reality
little
save
a
confused
blending
of
hues
and
metals
and
orders
and
weapons
and
snowy
beards
and
olive
faces
and
french
elegance
and
glitter
fused
with
the
grave
majesty
of
arab
pomp
for
her
thoughts
were
not
with
the
scene
around
her
but
with
the
soldier
who
was
without
in
that
teeming
crowd
of
tents
who
lived
in
poverty
and
danger
and
the
hard
slavery
of
unquestioning
obedience
and
asked
only
to
be
as
one
dead
to
all
who
had
known
and
loved
him
in
his
youth
it
was
in
vain
that
she
repelled
the
memory
it

of

democrat

was

years
old
she
had
sat
on
the
topmost
pile
of
a
parisian
barricade
with
the
red
bonnet
on
her
curls
and
had
clapped
her
tiny
hands
for
delight
when
the
bullets
flew
and
the
marseillaise
rose
above
the
cannonading
and
the
spirit
of
the
musketry
and
of

together
passed
into
her
and
made
her
what
she
was
she
was
a
genuine
democrat
and
nothing
short
of
the
pure
isonomy
of
the
greeks
was
tolerated
in
her
political
philosophy
though
she
could
not
have
told
what
such
a
word
had
meant
for
her
life
she
had
all
the
furious
prejudices
and
all
the
instinctive
truths
in
her
of
an
uncompromising
rouge
and
the
sight
alone
of
those
lofty
standards
signalizing
the
place
of
rest
of
the
aristocrats
while
her
children
lowly
tents
wore
in
her
sight
all
the
dignity
and
all
the
distinction
of
the
true
field
would
have
aroused
her
ire
at
any
time
but
now
a
hate
tenfold
keener
moved
her
she
had
a
jealousy
of
the
one
in
whose
honor
those
two
foreign
ensigns
floated
that
was
the
most
bitter
thing
which
had
ever
entered
her
short
and
sunny
life
a
hate
the
hotter
because
tinged
with
that
sickening
sense
of
because
mingled
with
that
wondering
emotion
at
beholding
something
so
utterly
unlike
to
all
that
she
had
known
or
dreamed
she
had
it
in
her
could
she
have
had
the
power
to
mercilessly
and
brutally
destroy
this
woman
beauty
which
was
so
far
above
her
reach
as
she
had
once
destroyed
the
ivory
wreath
yet
as
that
of
the
carving
had
done
so
did
this
fair
and
regal
beauty
touch
her
even
in
the
midst
of
her
fury
with
a
certain
reverent
awe
with
a
certain
dim
sense
of
something
her
own
life
had
missed
she
had
trodden
the
ivory
in
pieces
with
all
the
violence
of
childish
savage
uncalculating
hate
and
she
had
been
chidden
as
by
a
rebuking
voice
by
the
wreck
which
her
action
had
made
at
her
feet
so
could
she
now
had
it
been
possible
have
ruined
and
annihilated
the
loveliness
that
filled
his
heart
and
his
soul
but
so
would
she
also
the
moment
her
instinct
to
avenge
herself
had
been
sated
have
felt
the
remorse
and
the
shame
of
having
struck
down
a
delicate
and
gracious
thing
that
even
in
its
destruction
had
a
glory
that
was
above
her
even
her
very
hate
attracted
her
to
the
sight
to
the
study
to
the
presence
of
this
woman
who
was
as
dissimilar
to
all
of
womanhood
that
had
ever
crossed
her
path
in
camp
and
barrack
as
the
pure
white
gleaming
lily
of
the
hothouse
is
unlike
the
yellow
leaf
in
the
mud
an
irresistible
fascination
drew
her
toward
the
pain
which
had
so
wounded
her
a
few
hours
before
an
impulse
more
intense
than
curiosity
and
more
vital
than
caprice
urged
her
to
the
vicinity
of
the
only
human
being
who
had
ever
awakened
in
her
the
pang
of
humiliation
the
throbs
of
envy
and
she
went
to
that
vicinity
now
that
the
daylight
had
just
changed
to
evening
and
the
ruddy
was
glowing
everywhere
from
great
pine
boughs
thrust
in
the
ground
with
their
resinous
branches
steeped
in
oil
and
flaring
alight
there
was
not
a
man
that
night
in
camp
who
would
have
dared
oppose
the
steps
of
the
young
heroine
of
the
cross
wherever
they
might
choose
in
their
fantastic
flight
to
wander
the
sentinels
passing
up
and
down
the
great
space
before
the
marquees
challenged
her
indeed
but
she
was
quick
to
give
the
answering
password
and
they
let
her
go
by
them
their
eyes
turning
after
the
little
picturesque
form
that
every
soldier
of
the
corps
of
africa
loved
almost
like
the
flag
beneath
which
he
fought
once
in
the
magic
circle
she
paused
a
while
the
desire
that
urged
her
on
and
the
hate
that
impelled
her
backward
keeping
her
rooted
there
in
the
dusky
shadow
which
the
flapping
standards
threw
to
creep
covertly
into
her
rival
presence
to
hide
herself
like
a
spy
to
see
what
she
wished
to
show
fear
or
hesitation
or
deference
were
not
in
the
least
what
she
contemplated
what
she
intended
was
to
confront
this
fair
strange
cold
cruel
thing
and
see
if
she
were
of
flesh
and
blood
like
other
living
beings
and
do
the
best
that
could
be
done
to
outrage
to
scourge
to
challenge
to
deride
her
with
all
the
insolent
artillery
of
camp
ribaldry
and
show
her
how
a
child
of
the
people
could
laugh
at
her
rank
and
affront
her
purity
and
scorn
her
power
definite
idea
there
was
none
to
her
she
had
come
on
impulse
but
a
vague
longing
in
some
way
to
break
down
that
proud
serenity
which
galled
her
so
sharply
and
bring
hot
blood
of
shame
into
that
delicate
face
and
cast
indignity
on
that
imperious
and
unassailable
pride
consumed
her
she
longed
to
do
as
some
girl
of
whom
she
had
once
been
told
by
an
old
invalide
had
done
in
the
a
girl
of
the
people
a
of
the
cannebiere
who
had
loved
one
above
her
rank
a
noble
who
deserted
her
for
a
woman
of
his
own
order
a
beautiful
scornful
aristocrat
with
the
silver
ring
of
merciless
laughter
and
the
languid
luster
of
sweet
contemptuous
eyes
the
marseillaise
bore
her
wrong
in
silence
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
south
and
of
the
populace
with
a
dark
brooding
burning
beauty
strong
and
fierce
and
braced
with
the
salt
lashing
of
the
sea
and
with
the
keen
breath
of
the
stormy
mistral
she
held
her
peace
while
the
great
lady
was
wooed
and
won
while
the
marriage
joys
came
with
the
purple
vintage
time
while
the
people
were
made
drunk
at
the
bridal
of
their
chatelaine
in
those
hot
ruddy
luscious
autumn
days
she
held
her
peace
and
the
terror
came
and
the
streets
of
the
city
by
the
sea
ran
blood
and
the
scorch
of
the
sun
blazed
every
noon
on
the
scaffold
then
she
had
her
vengeance
she
stood
and
saw
the
ax
fall
down
on
the
proud
neck
that
never
had
bent
till
it
bent
there
and
she
drew
the
severed
head
into
her
own
bronzed
hands
and
smote
the
lips
his
lips
had
kissed
a
cruel
blow
that
blurred
their
beauty
out
and
twined
a
in
the
long
and
glistening
hair
and
drew
it
laughing
as
she
went
through
dust
and
mire
and
gore
and
over
the
rough
stones
of
the
town
and
through
the
shouting
crowds
of
the
multitudes
and
tossed
it
out
on
to
the
sea
laughing
still
as
the
waves
flung
it
out
from
billow
to
billow
and
the
fish
sucked
it
down
to
make
their
feast
she
stood
and
laughed
by
the
side
of
the
gray
angry
water
watching
the
tresses
of
the
floating
hair
sink
downward
like
a
heap
of
weed
that
horrible
story
came
to
the
memory
of
cigarette
now
as
it
had
been
told
her
by
the
old
soldier
who
in
his
boyhood
had
seen
the
entry
of
the
marseillais
to
paris
she
knew
what
the
woman
of
the
people
had
felt
when
she
had
bruised
and
mocked
and
thrown
out
to
the
devouring
waters
that
fair
and
fallen
head
i
could
do
it
i
could
do
it
she
thought
with
the
savage
instinct
of
her
nature
dominant
leaving
uppermost
only
its
ferocity
the
same
ferocity
as
had
moved
the
southern
woman
to
wreak
her
hatred
on
the
senseless
head
of
her
rival
the
school
in
which
the
had
been
reared
had
been
one
to
foster
all
those
barbaric
impulses
to
leave
in
their
inborn
uncontrolled
force
all
those
native
desires
which
the
human
shares
with
the
animal
nature
there
had
been
no
more
to
teach
her
that
these
were
criminal
or
forbidden
than
there
is
to
teach
the
young
tigress
that
it
is
cruel
to
tear
the
antelope
for
food
what
cigarette
was
that
nature
had
made
her
she
was
no
more
trained
to
or
to
the
knowledge
of
good
than
is
the
tiger
cub
as
it
wantons
in
its
play
under
the
great
broad
tropic
leaves
now
she
acted
on
her
impulse
her
impulse
of
open
scorn
of
rank
of
reckless
vindication
of
her
right
to
do
just
whatsoever
pleasured
her
and
she
went
boldly
forward
and
dashed
aside
with
no
gentle
hand
the
folds
that
hung
before
the
entrance
of
the
tent
and
stood
there
with
the
gleam
of
the
starry
night
and
the
glow
of
the
torches
behind
her
so
that
her
picturesque
and
brightly
colored
form
looked
painted
on
a
dusky
lurid
background
of
shadow
and
of
flame
the
action
startled
the
occupants
of
the
tent
and
made
them
both
look
up
they
were
venetia
corona
and
a
levantine
woman
who
was
her
favorite
and
most
devoted
attendant
and
had
been
about
her
from
her
birth
the
tent
was
the
first
of
three
set
aside
for
her
occupancy
and
had
been
adorned
with
as
much
luxury
as
was
procurable
and
with
many
of
the
rich
and
curious
things
of
algerian
art
and
workmanship
so
far
as
they
could
be
hastily
collected
by
the
skill
and
quickness
of
the
french
intendance
cigarette
stood
silently
looking
at
the
scene
on
which
she
had
thus
broken
without
leave
or
question
she
saw
nothing
of
it
except
one
head
lifted
in
surprise
at
her
entrance
just
such
a
head
just
so
proudly
carried
just
so
crowned
with
gleaming
hair
as
that
which
the
marseillaise
had
dragged
through
the
dust
of
the
streets
and
cast
out
into
the
lust
of
the
sharks
venetia
hesitated
a
moment
in
astonished
wonder
then
with
the
grace
and
the
courtesy
of
her
race
rose
and
approached
the
entrance
of
her
tent
in
which
that
fierce
half
a
soldier
half
a
child
was
standing
with
the
fitful
reddened
light
behind
she
recognized
whose
it
was
is
it
you
ma
petite
she
said
kindly
come
within
do
not
be
afraid
she
spoke
with
the
gentle
consideration
of
a
great
lady
to
one
whom
she
admired
for
her
heroism
compassionated
for
her
position
and
thought
naturally
in
need
of
such
encouragement
she
had
liked
the
frank
fearless
ardent
brunette
face
of
the
little
friend
of
the
flag
she
had
liked
her
fiery
and
indomitable
defense
of
the
soldier
of
zaraila
she
felt
an
interest
in
her
as
deep
as
her
pity
and
she
was
above
the
scruples
which
many
women
of
her
rank
might
have
had
as
to
the
fitness
of
entering
into
conversation
with
this
child
of
the
army
she
was
gentle
to
her
as
to
a
young
bird
a
young
kitten
a
young
colt
what
her
brother
had
said
of
the
vivandiere
love
for
one
whom
the
girl
only
knew
as
a

them
bite
the
dust
under
my
fire

you
think

would
check
for
a
moment
at
dealing
you
death
you
beautiful
useless
honeyed
poisoned
painted
exotic
that
has
every
wind
tempered
to
you
and
thinks
the
world
only
made
to
bear
the
fall
of
your
foot
the
fury
of
words
was
poured
out
without
pause
and
with
an
intense
passion
vibrating
through
them
the
wine
was
hot
in
her
veins
the
hate
was
hot
in
her
heart
her
eyes
glittered
with
murderous
meaning
and
she
darted
with
one
swift
bound
to
the
side
of
the
rival
she
loathed
with
the
pistol
half
out
of
her
belt
she
expected
to
see
the
one
she
threatened
recoil
quail
hear
the
threat
in
terror
she
mistook
the
nature
with
which
she
dealt
venetia
corona
never
moved
never
gave
a
sign
of
the
amazement
that
awoke
in
her
but
she
put
her
hand
out
and
clasped
the
barrel
of
the
weapon
while
her
eyes
looked
down
into
the
flashing
looming
ferocious
ones
that
menaced
her
with
calm
contemptuous
rebuke
in
which
something
of
infinite
pity
was
mingled
child
are
you
mad
she
said
gravely
brave
natures
do
not
stoop
to
assassination
which
you
seem
to
deify
if
you
have
any
reason
to
feel
evil
against
me
tell
me
what
it
is
i
always
repair
a
wrong
if
i
can
but
as
for
those
threats
they
are
most
absurd
if
you
do
not
mean
them
they
are
most
wicked
if
you
the
tranquil
unmoved
serious
words
stilled
the
vehement
passion
she
rebuked
with
a
strange
and
irresistible
power
under
her
gaze
the
savage
lust
in
cigarette
eyes
died
out
and
their
lids
drooped
over
them
the
dusky
scarlet
color
failed
from
her
cheeks
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
humiliated
vanquished
awed
if
this
aristocrat
had
shown
one
sign
of
fear
one
trace
of
apprehension
all
her
violent
and
reckless
hatred
would
have
reigned
on
and
it
might
have
been
have
rushed
from
threat
to
execution
but
showing
the
only
quality
that
of
courage
for
which
she
had
respect
her
great
rival
confused
and
disarmed
her
she
was
only
sensible
with
a
vivid
agonizing
sense
of
shame
that
her
only
cause
of
hatred
against
this
woman
was
that
he
loved
her
and
this
she
would
have
died
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
have
acknowledged
she
let
the
pistol
pass
into
venetia
grasp
and
stood
irresolute
and
ashamed
her
fluent
tongue
stricken
dumb
her
intent
to
wound
and
sting
and
outrage
with
every
vile
coarse
jest
she
knew
rendered
impossible
to
execute
the
purity
and
the
dignity
of
her
presence
had
their
irresistible
influence
an
influence
too
strong
for
even
her
debonair
and
dangerous
insolence
she
hated
herself
in
that
moment
more
than
she
hated
her
rival
venetia
laid
the
loaded
pistol
down
away
from
both
and
seated
herself
on
the
cushions
from
which
she
had
risen
then
she
looked
once
more
long
and
quietly
at
her
unknown
antagonist
well
she
said
at
length
why
do
you
venture
to
come
here
and
why
do
you
feel
this
malignity
toward
a
stranger
who
never
saw
you
until
this
morning
under
the
challenge
the
fiery
spirit
of
cigarette
rallied
though
a
rare
and
galling
sense
of
intense
inferiority
of
intense
mortification
was
upon
her
though
she
would
almost
have
given
the
cross
which
was
on
her
breast
that
she
had
never
come
into
this
woman
sight
oh
ah
she
answered
recklessly
with
the
red
blood
flushing
her
face
again
at
the
only
evasion
of
truth
of
which
the
little
desperado
with
all
her
sins
had
ever
been
guilty
i
hate
you
milady
because
of
your
order
because
of
your
nation
because
of
your
fine
dainty
ways
because
of
your
aristocrat
insolence
because
you
treat
my
soldiers
like
paupers
because
you
are
one
of
those
who
do
no
more
to
have
the
right
to
live
than
the
purple
butterfly
that
flies
in
the
sun
and
who
oust
the
people
out
of
their
dues
as
the
cuckoo
kicks
the
poor
birds
that
have
reared
it
out
of
the
nest
of
down
to
which
it
never
has
carried
a
twig
or
a
moss
her
listener
heard
with
a
slight
smile
of
amusement
and
of
surprise
that
bitterly
discomfited
the
speaker
to
venetia
corona
the
seemed
mad
but
it
was
a
madness
that
interested
her
and
she
knew
at
a
glance
that
this
child
of
the
army
was
of
no
common
nature
and
no
common
mind
i
do
not
wish
to
discuss
democracy
with
you
she
answered
with
a
tone
that
sounded
strangely
tranquil
to
cigarette
after
the
scathing
acrimony
of
her
own
i
should
probably
convince
you
as
little
as
you
would
convince
me
and
i
never
waste
words
but
i
heard
you
claim
a
certain
virtue
justice
how
do
you
reconcile
with
that
your
very
hasty
condemnation
of
a
stranger
of
whose
motives
actions
and
modes
of
life
it
is
impossible
you
can
have
any
accurate
knowledge

once
again
was
silenced
her
face
burned
her
heart
was
hot
with
rage
she
had
come
prepared
to
upbraid
and
to
outrage
this
patrician
with
every
jibe
and
grossness
camp
usage
could
supply
her
with
and
she
stood
dumb
before
her
she
could
only
feel
an
sense
of
being
ridiculous
and
contemptible
and
puerile
in
her
sight
you
bring
two
charges
against
me

venetia
when
she
had
vainly
awaited
answer
that
i
treat
your
comrades
like
paupers

that
i
rob

putting

but
i

only
see
how
birth
is
an
angel

gives
such

you
eternal
sunlight

how
birth
is
a

had
been
so
far
from

there
was
an

eloquence
in
the
low
deep
words
that
seemed
to
thrill
through
the
stillness
nor
do
you
know
how
many
shadows
checker
that
light
which
you
envy
but
i
have
said
it
is
useless
for
me
to
argue
these
questions
with
you
you
commence
with
a
hatred
of
a
class
all
justice
is
over
wherever
that
element
enters
if
i
were
what
you
think
i
should
bid
you
leave
my
presence
which
you
have
entered
so
rudely
i
do
not
desire
to
do
that
i
am
sure
that
the
heroine
of
zaraila
has
something
nobler
in
her
than
mere
malignity
against
a
person
who
can
never
have
injured
her
and
i
would
endure
her
insolence
for
the
sake
of
awakening
her
justice
a
virtue
that
was
so
great
in
her
at
noon

be
utterly
dead
at

fearless
eyes
drooped
under
the
gaze
of
those
bent
so
searchingly
yet
so
gently
upon
her
but
only
for
a
moment
she
raised
them
afresh
with
their
old
dauntless
frankness
dieu
you
shall
never
say
you
wanted
justice
and
truth
from
a
french
soldier
and
failed
to
get
them
i
hate
you
never
mind
why
i
do
though
you
never
harmed
me
i
came
here
for
two
reasons
one
because
i
wanted
to
look
at
you
close
you
are
not
like
anything
that
i
ever
saw
the
other
because
i
wanted
to
wound
you
to
hurt
you
to
outrage
you
if
i
could
find
a
way
how
and
you
will
not
let
me
do
it
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
in
in
all
her
courted
life
the
great
lady
had
had
no
truer
homage
than
lay
in
that
irate
reluctant
wonder
of
this
fiery
foe
she
smiled
slightly
my
poor
child
it
is
rather
something
in
yourself
a
native
nobility
that
will
not
allow
you
to
be
as
unjust
and
as
insolent
as
your
soul
desires
cigarette
gave
a
movement
of
intolerable
impatience
pardieu
do
not
pity
me
or
i
shall
give
you
a
taste
of
my
in
earnest
you
may
be
a
sovereign
grand
dame
everywhere
else
but
you
can
carry
no
terror
with
you
for
me
i
promise
you
i
do
not
seek
to
do
so
if
i
did
not
feel
interest
in
you
do
you
suppose
i
should
suffer
for
a
moment
the
ignorant
rudeness
of
an
child
you
fail
in
the
tact
as
in
the
courtesy
that
belong
to
your
the
rebuke
was
gentle
but
it
was
all
the
more
severe
for
its
very
serenity
it
cut
cigarette
to
the
quick
it
covered
her
with
an
overwhelming
sense
of
mortification
and
of
failure
she
was
too
keen
and
too
just
despite
all
her
vanity
not
to
feel
that
she
had
deserved
the
condemnation
and
not
to
know
that
her
opponent
had
all
the
advantage
and
all
the
justice
on
her
side
she
had
done
nothing
by
coming
here
nothing
except
to
appear
as
an
insolent
and
wayward
child
before
her
superb
rival
and
to
feel
a
very
anguish
of
inferiority
before
the
grace
the
calm
the
beauty
the
nameless
potent
charm
of
this
woman
whom
she
had
intended
to
humiliate
and
injure
the
inborn
truth
within
her
the
native
generosity
and
candor
that
soon
or
late
always
overruled
every
other
element
in
the
little
one
conquered
her
now
she
dashed
down
her
cross
on
the
ground
and
trod
passionately
on
the
decoration
she
adored
i
disgrace
it
the
first
day
i
wear
it
you
are
right
though
i
hate
you
and
you
are
as
beautiful
as
a
sorceress
there
is
no
wonder
he
loves
you
he
who
there
was
a
colder
and
more
utterly
amazed
hauteur
in
the
interrogation
than
had
come
into
her
voice
throughout
the
interview
yet
on
her
fair
face
a
faint
warmth
rose
the
words
were
out
and
cigarette
was
reckless
what
she
said
almost
unconscious
indeed
in
the
violence
of
the
many
emotions
in
her
the
man
who
carves
the
toys
you
give
your
dog
to
break
she
answered
bitterly
dieu
de
dieu
he
loves
you
when
he
was
down
with
his
wounds
after
zaraila
he
said
so
but
he
never
knew
what
he
said
and
he
never
knew
that
i
heard
him
you
are
like
the
women
of
his
old
world
though
through
you
he
got
treated
like
a
dog
he
loves
you
of
whom
do
you
venture
to
speak
the
cold
calm
dignity
of
the
question
whose
very
tone
was
a
rebuke
came
strangely
after
the
violent
audacity
of
cigarette
speech
sacre
bleu
of
him
i
tell
you
who
was
made
to
bring
his
wares
to
you
like
a
hawker
and
you
think
it
insult
i
will
warrant
insult
for
a
soldier
who
has
nothing
but
his
courage
and
his
endurance
and
his
heroism
under
suffering
to
ennoble
him
to
dare
to
love
mme
la
princesse
corona
i
think
otherwise
i
think
that
mme
la
princesse
corona
never
had
a
love
of
so
much
honor
though
she
has
had
princes
and
nobles
and
all
the
men
of
her
rank
no
doubt
at
her
feet
through
that
beauty
that
is
like
a
spell
hurried
headlong
by
her
own
vehemence
and
her
own
hatred
for
her
rival
which
drove
her
to
magnify
the
worth
of
the
passion
of
which
she
was
so
jealous
that
she
might
lessen
if
she
could
the
pride
of
her
on
whom
it
was
lavished
she
never
paused
to
care
what
she
said
or
heed
what
its
consequences
might
become
she
felt
incensed
amazed
irritated
to
see
no
trace
of
any
emotion
come
on
her
hearer
face
the
hot
impetuous
expansive
untrained
nature
underrated
the
power
for
of
the
order
she
so
blindly
hated
you
speak
idly
and
at
random
like
the
child
you
are
the
grande
dame
answered
her
with
chill
contemptuous
rebuke
i
do
not
imagine
that
the
person
you
allude
to
made
you
his
confidante
in
such
a
matter
he
retorted
cigarette
he
belongs
to
your
class
milady
he
is
as
silent
as
the
grave
you
might
kill
him
and
he
would
never
show
it
hurt
i
only
know
what
he
muttered
in
his
when
you
attended
him
not
i
cried
cigarette
who
saw
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
betraying
herself
he
lay
in
the
scullion
tent
where
i
was
that
was
all
and
he
was
delirious
with
the
men
often
are
wait
hear
me
a
little
while
before
you
rush
on
in
this
headlong
and
foolish
speech
interrupted
her
auditor
who
had
in
a
moment
rapid
thought
decided
on
her
course
with
this
strange
wayward
nature
you
err
in
the
construction
you
have
placed
on
the
words
whatever
they
were
which
you
heard
the
gentleman
he
is
a
gentleman
whom
you
speak
of
bears
me
no
love
we
are
almost
strangers
but
by
a
strange
chain
of
circumstances
he
is
connected
with
my
family
he
once
had
great
friendship
with
my
brother
for
reasons
that
i
do
not
know
but
which
are
imperative
with
him
he
desires
to
keep
his
identity
unsuspected
by
everyone
an
accident
alone
revealed
it
to
me
and
i
have
promised
him
not
to
divulge
it
you
understand
cigarette
gave
an
affirmative
gesture
her
eyes
were
fastened
suddenly
yet
with
a
deep
bright
glow
in
them
upon
her
companion
she
was
beginning
to
see
her
way
through
his
secret
a
secret
she
was
too
intrinsically
loyal
even
now
to
dream
of
betraying
you
spoke
very
nobly
for
him
you
have
the
fealty
of
one
brave
character
to
another
i

with

keep
the
evil

you

nodded
assent
the
sullen
still
burned
in

but
she
succumbed
to
the
resistless
influence
which
the
serenity
the
patience
and
the
dignity
of
this
woman
had
over
her
she
was
studying

all
this
while
with
the
keen
rapid
perceptions
of
envy
and
of
jealousy
studying
her
features
her
form
her
dress
her
attitude
all
the
many
various
and
intangible
marks
of
birth
and
breeding
which
were
so
new
to
her
and
which
made
her
rival
seem
so
strange
so
dazzling
so
marvelous
a
sorceress
to
her
and
all
the
while
the
sense
of
her
own
inferiority
her
own
worthlessness
her
own
boldness
her
own
debasement
was
growing
upon
her
eating
sharply
into
the
metal
of
her
vanity
and
her
pride
humiliating
her
unbearably
yet
making
her
heart
ache
with
a
sad
pathetic
pity
for

is
of
your

then
she
asked
abruptly
he
was
oh
ha
cried
cigarette
with
her
old
irony
then
he
must
be
always
must
he
you
think
too
much
of
your
blue
blood
you
patricians
to
fancy
it
can
lose
its
royalty
whether
it
run
under
a

they

well
perhaps
it
does
some
say
my

was
a
prince
of

maybe
so
he
is
of
your
order
bah
i
knew
that
the
first
day
i
saw
his
hands
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
why
he
lives
among
us
buried
like
this
not
if
you
violate
any
confidence
to
do
pardieu
he
makes
no
confidence
i
promise
you
not
ten
words
will
monsieur
say
if
he
can
help
it
about
anything
he
is
as
silent
as
a
lama
but
we
learn
things
without
being
told
in
camp
and
i
know
well
enough
he
is
here
to
save
someone
else
in
someone
place
it
is
a
sacrifice
look
you
that
nails
him
down
to
this
her
auditor
was
silent
she
thought
as
the
vivandiere
thought
but
the
pride
in
her
the
natural
reticence
and
reserve
of
her
class
made
her
shrink
from
discussing
the
history
of
one
whom
she
knew
shrink
from
having
any
argument
on
his
past
or
future
with
a
saucy
rough
fiery
young
who
had
broken
thus
unceremoniously
on
her
privacy
yet
she
needed
greatly
to
be
able
to
trust
cigarette
the
child
was
the
only
means
through
which
she
could
send
him
a
warning
that
must
be
sent
and
there
were
a
bravery
and
a
truth
in
her
which
attracted
the
aristocrat
to
whom
she
was
so
singular
and
novel
a
rarity
as
though
she
were
some
young
savage
of
desert
western
isles
look
you
milady
said
cigarette
half
sullenly
half
passionately
for
the
words
were
wrenched
out
of
her
generosity
and
choked
her
in
their
utterance
that
man
suffers
his
life
here
is
a
hell
upon
earth
i
do
mean
for
the
danger
he
is
bon
soldat
but
for
the
indignity
the
subordination
the
license
the
brutality
the
tyranny
he
is
as
if
he
were
chained
to
the
galleys
he
never
says
anything
oh
no
he
is
of
your
kind
you
know
but
he
suffers
mort
de

he
suffers
now
if
you
be
his
friend
can
you
do
nothing
for
him
can
you
ransom
him
in
no
way
can
you
go
away
out
of
africa
and
leave
him
in
this
living
death
to
get
killed
and
thrust
into
the
sand
like
his
comrade
the
other
day
her
hearer
did
not
answer
the
words
made
her
heart
ache
they
cut
her
to
the
soul
it
was
not
for
the
first
time
that
the
awful
desolation
of
his
future
had
been
present
before
her
but
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
fate
to
which
she
would
pass
away
and
leave
him
had
been
so
directly
in
words
before
her
cigarette
obeying
the
generous
impulses
of
her
better
nature
and
abandoning
self
with
the
same
reckless
impetuosity
with
which
a
moment
before
she
would
if
she
could
have
sacrificed
her
rival
saw
the
advantage
gained
and
pursued
it
with
rapid
skill
she
was
pleading
against
herself
no
matter
in
that
instant
she
was
capable
of
crucifying
herself
and
only
remembering
mercy
to
the
absent
i
have
heard
she
went
on
vehemently
for
the
utterance
to
which
she
forced
herself
was
very
cruel
to
her
that
you
of
the
noblesse
are
stanch
as
steel
to
your
own
people
it
is
the
best
virtue
that
you
have
well
he
is
of
your
people
will
you
go
away
in
your
negligent
indifference
and
leave
him
to
eat
his
heart
out
in
bitterness
and
misery
he
was
your
brother
friend
he
was
known
to
you
in
his
early
time
you
said
so
and
are
you
cold
enough
and
cruel
enough
milady
not
to
make
one
effort
to
redeem
him
out
of
bondage
to
go
back
to
your
palaces
and
your
pleasures
and
your
luxuries
and
your
flatteries
and
be
happy
while
this
man
is
left
on
bearing
his
yoke
here
and
it
is
a
yoke
that
galls
that
kills
bearing
it
until
in
some
day
of
desperation
a
naked
blade
cuts
its
way
to
his
heart
and
makes
its
pulse
cease
forever
if
you
do
you
patricians
are
worse
still
than
i
thought
you
venetia
heard
her
without
interruption
a
great
sadness
came
over
her
face
as
the
vivid
phrases
followed
each
other
she
was
too
absorbed
in
the
subject
of
them
to
heed
the
challenge
and
the
insolence
of
their
manner
she
knew
that
the
little
one
who
spoke
them
loved
him
though
so
tenacious
to
conceal
her
love
and
she
was
touched
not
less
by
the
magnanimity
which
for
his
sake
sought
to
release
him
from
the
african
service
than
by
the
hopelessness
of
his
coming
years
as
thus
prefigured
before
her
your
reproaches
are
unneeded
she
replied
slowly
and
wearily
i
could
not
abandon
one
who
was
once
the
friend
of
my
family
to
such
a
fate
as
you
picture
without
very
great
pain
but
i
do
not
see
how
to
alter
this
fate
as
you
think
i
could
do
with
so
much
ease
i
am
not
in
its
secret
i
do
not
know
the
reason
of
its
seeming
suicide
i
have
no
more
connection
with
its
intricacies
than
you
have
this
gentleman
has
chosen
his
own
path
it
is
not
for
me
to
change
his
choice
or
spy
into
his
cigarette

searching

their
brown
light
on
her

you
are
courageous
to
those
who
are
so
all
things
are
a
great
fallacy
you
must
have
seen
many
courageous
men
vanquished
but
what
would
you
imply
by
it
that
you
can
help
this
man
if
you
would
that
i
could
but
i
can
discern
no
means
make
even
in
that
moment
her
listener
smiled
involuntarily
at
the
curt
imperious
tones
decisive
as
napoleon
partons
before
the
passage
of
the
alps
be
certain
if
i
can
i
will
meantime
there
is
one
pressing
danger
of
which
you
must
be
my
medium
to
warn
him
he
and
my
brother
must
not
meet
tell
him
that
the
latter
knowing
him
only
as
louis
victor
and
interested
in
the
incidents
of
his
military
career
will
seek
him
out
early
morning
before
we
quit
the
camp
i
must
leave
it
to
him
to
avoid
the
meeting
as
best
he
may
be

grimly
you
do
not
know
much
of
the

victor
is
only
a
if
his
officers
call
him
up

must
come
or
be

no

an
irrepressible
gesture
of
pain

i
forgot
well
go
and
send
him
to
me
my
brother
must
be
taken
into
his
confidence
whatever
that
confidence
reveals
i
will
tell
him
so
go
and
send
him
to
me
it
is
the
last
cigarette
gave
no
movement
of
assent
all
the
jealous
rage
in
her
flared
up
afresh
to
stifle
the
noble
and
unselfish
instincts
under
which
she
had
been
led
during
the
later
moments
a
coarse
and
impudent
scoff
rose
to
her
tongue
but
it
remained
unuttered
she
could
not
speak
it
under
that
glance
which
held
the
evil
in
her
in
subjection
and
compelled
her
reluctant
reverence
against
her

tell
him
to
come
here
to
me
repeated
venetia
with
the
calm
decision
of
one
to
whom
any
possibility
of
false
interpretation
of
her
motives
never
occurred
and
who
was
habituated
to
the
free
action
that
accompanied
an
unassailable
rank
my
brother
must
know
what
i
know
i
shall
be
alone
and
he
can
make
his
way
hither
without
doubt
unobserved
go
and
say
this
to
him
you
are
his
loyal
little
friend

at
her
steadfastly
with
a
certain
contempt
in
the
look
then
your
pleading
for
him
was
all
insincere
let
the
matter
drop
and
be
good
enough
to
leave
my
presence
which
you
will
remember
you
entered
unsummoned
and
the
undeviating
gentleness
of
the
tone
made
the
rebuke
cut
deeper
as
her
first
rebuke
had
cut
than
any
sterner
censure
or
more
peremptory
dismissal
could
have
done
cigarette
stood
irresolute
ashamed
filled
with
rage
torn
by
contrition
impatient
wounded
swayed
by
jealous
rage
and
by
the
purer
impulses
she
strove
to
stifle
the
cross
she
had
tossed
down
caught
her
sight
as
it
glittered
on
the
carpet
strewn
over
the
hard
earth
she
stooped
and
raised
it
the
action
sufficed
to
turn
the
tide
with
her
impressionable
ardent
capricious
nature
she
would
not
disgrace
that
i

go

muttered
in
her
throat
and
you
you
o
god
no
wonder
men
love
you
when
even
i
can
not
hate
you
almost
ere
the
words
were

she
had
dashed
aside
the
hangings
before
the
tent
entrance
and
had
darted
out
into
the
night
air
venetia
corona
gazed
after
the
swiftly
flying
figure
as
it
passed
over
the
starlit
ground
lost
in
amazement
in
pity
and
in
regret
wondering
afresh
if
she
had
only
dreamed
of
this
strange
interview
in
the
algerian
camp
which
seemed
to
have
come
and
gone
with
the
blinding
rapidity
of
lightning
a
little
tigress
she
thought
and
yet
with
infinite
nobility
with
wonderful
germs
of
good
in
her
of
such
a
nature
what
a
rare
life
might
have
been
made
as
it
is
her
childhood
we
smile
at
and
forgive
but
great
heaven
what
will
be
her
maturity
her
old
age
yet
how
she
loves
him
and
she
is
so
brave
she
will
not
show
with
the
recollection
came
the
remembrance
of
cigarette
words
as
to
his
own
passion
for
herself
and
she
grew
paler
as
it
did
so
god
forbid
he
should
have
that
pain
too
she
murmured
what
could
it
be
save
misery
for
us
both
yet
she
did
not
thrust
the
fancy
from
her
with
contemptuous
nonchalance
as
she
had
done
every
other
of
the
many
passions
she
had
excited
and
disdained
it
had
a
great
sadness
and
a
greater
terror
for
her
she
dreaded
it
slightly
for
herself
she
wished
now
that
she
had
not
sent
for
him
but
it
was
done
it
was
for
sake
of
their
old
friendship
and
she
was
not
one
to
vainly
regret
what
was
unalterable
or
to
desert
what
she
deemed
generous
and
right
for
the
considerations
of
prudence
or
of
egotism

ordeal
by
fire
amid
the
mirth
the
noise
the
festivity
which
reigned
throughout
the
camp
as
the
men
surrendered
themselves
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
largesses
of
food
and
of
wine
allotted
to
them
by
their
marshal
command
in
commemoration
of
zaraila
one
alone
remained
apart
silent
and
powerless
to
rouse
himself
even
to
the
forced
semblance
the
forced
endurance
of
their
mischief
and
their
pleasure
they
knew
him
well
and
they
also
loved
him
too
well
to
press
such
participation
on
him
they
knew
that
it
was
no
lack
of
sympathy
with
them
that
made
him
so
grave
amid
their
mirth
so
mute
amid
their
volubility
some
thought
that
he
was
sorely
wounded
by
the
delay
of
the
honors
promised
him
others
who
knew
him
better
thought
that
it
was
the
loss
of
his
which
weighed
on
him
and
made
all
the
scene
around
him
full
of
pain
none
approached
him
but
while
they
feasted
in
their
tents
making
the
celebration
of
zaraila
equal
to
the
jour
de
mazagran
he
sat
alone
over
a
on
the
far
outskirts
of
the
camp
his
heart
was
sick
within
him
to
remain
here
was
to
risk
with
every
moment
that
ordeal
of
recognition
which
he
so
utterly
dreaded
and
to
flee
was
to
leave
his
name
to
the
men
with
whom
he
had
served
so
long
covered
with
obloquy
and
odium
buried
under
all
the
burning
shame
and
degradation
of
a
traitor
and
deserter
memory
the
latter
course
was
impossible
to
him
the
only
alternative
was
to
trust
that
the
vastness
of
that
great
concrete
body
of
which
he
was
one
unit
would
suffice
to
hide
him
from
the
discovery
of
the
friend
whose
love
he
feared
as
he
feared
the
hatred
of
no
foe
he
had
not
been
seen
as
he
had
passed
the
there
was
little
fear
that
in
the
few
remaining
hours
any
chance
could
bring
the
illustrious
guest
of
a
marshal
to
the
outpost
of
the
scattered
camp
yet
he
shuddered
as
he
sat
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
of
pinewood
she
was
so
near
and
he
could
not
behold
her
though
he
might
never
see
her
face
again
though
they
must
pass
out
of
africa
home
to
the
land
that
he
desired
as
only
exiles
can
desire
while
he
still
remained
silent
knowing
that
until
death
should
release
him
there
could
be
no
other
fate
for
him
save
only
this
one
hard
bitter
desolate
uncompanioned
unpitied
unrewarded
life
but
to
break
his
word
as
the
price
of
his
freedom
was
not
possible
to
his
nature
or
in
his
creed
this
fate
was
in
chief
of
his
own
making
he
accepted
it
without
rebellion
because
rebellion
would
have
been
in
this
case
both
cowardice
and
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
heroism
in
this
it
seemed
to
him
the
only
course
left
to
a
man
who
in
losing
the
position
had
not
abandoned
the
instincts
of
a
gentleman
the
evening
wore
away
unmeasured
by
him
the
echoes
of
the
mirth
came
dimly
on
his
ear
the
laughter
and
the
songs
and
the
music
were
subdued
into
one
confused
murmur
by
distance
there
was
nothing
near
him
except
a
few
tethered
horses
and
far
way
the
mounted
figure
of
the
guard
who
kept
watch
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
encampment
the
fire
burned
on
for
it
had
been
piled
high
before
it
was
abandoned
the
little
white
dog
of
his
regiment
was
curled
at
his
feet
he
sat
motionless
sunk
in
thought
with
his
head
drooped
upon
his
breast
the
voice
of
cigarette
broke
on
his
musing
beau
sire
you
are
wanted
he
looked
up
wearily
could
he
never
be
at
peace
he
did
not
notice
that
the
tone
of
the
greeting
was
rough
and
curt
he
did
not
notice
that
there
was
a
stormy
darkness
a
repressed
bitterness
stern
and
scornful
on
the
little
one
face
he
only
thought
that
the
very
dogs
were
left
sometimes
at
rest
and
unchained
but
a
soldier
never
you
are
wanted
repeated
cigarette
with
imperious
contempt
he
rose
on
the
old
instinct
of
obedience
for
what
she
stood
looking
at
him
without
replying
her
mouth
was
tightly
shut
in
a
hard
line
that
pressed
inward
all
its
soft
and
rosy
prettiness
she
was
seeing
how
haggard
his
face
was
how
heavy
his
eyes
how
full
of
fatigue
his
movements
her
silence
recalled
him
to
the
memory
of
the
past
day
forgive
me
my
dear
child
if
i
have
seemed
without
sympathy
in
all
your
honors
he
said
gently
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
believe
me
it
was
unintentional
no
one
knows
better
than
i
how
richly
you
deserved
them
no
one
rejoices
more
that
you
should
have
received
the
very
gentleness
of
the
apology
stung
her
like
a
scorpion
she
shook
herself
roughly
out
of
his
hold
point
de
phrases
all
the
army
is
at
my
back
do
you
think
i
can
not
do
without
you
sympathy
too
bah
we
do
know
those
fine
words
in
camp
you
are
wanted
i
tell
you
go
but
where
to
your
silver
pheasant
yonder
go
who
i
do
not
dame
can
you
not
understand
milady
wants
to
see
you
i
told
her
i
would
send
you
to
her
you
can
use
your
dainty
sentences
with
her
she
is
of
your
order
what
she
wishes
go
reiterated
the
little
one
with
a
stamp
of
her
boot
you
know
the
great
tent
where
she
is
throned
in
honor
morbleu
as
if
the
oldest
and
ugliest
hag
that
washes
out
my
soldiers
linen
were
not
of
more
use
and
more
deserved
such
lodgment
than
mme
la
princesse
who
has
never
done
aught
in
her
life
not
even
brushed
out
her
own
hair
of
gold
she
waits
for
you
where
are
your
palace
manners
go
to
her
i
tell
you
she
is
of
your
own
people
we
are
not
the
vehement
imperious
phrases
coursed
in
disorder
one
after
another
rapid
and
harsh
and
vibrating
with
a
hundred
repressed
emotions
he
paused
one
moment
doubting
whether
she
did
not
play
some
trick
upon
him
then
without
a
word
left
her
and
went
rapidly
through
the
evening
shadows
cigarette
stood
looking
after
him
with
a
gaze
that
was
very
evil
almost
savage
in
its
wrath
in
its
pain
in
its
fiery
jealousy
that
ached
so
hotly
in
her
and
was
chained
down
by
that
pride
which
was
as
intense
in
the
vivandiere
of
algeria
as
ever
it
could
be
in
any
duchess
of
a
court
reckless
unfeminine
hardened
vitiated
in
much
as
all
her
sex
would
have
deemed
and
capable
of
the
utmost
abandonment
to
her
passion
had
it
been
returned
the
haughty
young
soul
of
the
child
of
the
people
was
as
sensitively
delicate
in
this
one
thing
as
the
purest
and
chastest
among
women
could
have
been
she
dreaded
above
every
other
thing
that
he
should
ever
suspect
that
she
loved
him
or
that
she
desired
his
love
her
honor
her
generosity
her
pity
for
him
her
natural
instinct
to
do
the
thing
that
was
right
even
to
her
foes
any
one
of
the
unstudied
and
unanalyzed
qualities
in
her
had
made
her
serve
him
even
at
her
bidding
but
it
had
cost
her
none
the
less
hardly
because
so
manfully
done
none
the
less
did
all
the
violent
ruthless
hate
the
vivid
childlike
fury
the
burning
intolerable
jealousy
of
her
nature
combat
in
her
with
the
cruel
sense
of
her
own
unlikeness
with
that
beauty
which
had
subdued
even
herself
and
with
that
nobler
impulse
of
which
grew
side
by
side
with
the
baser
impulses
of
passion
as
she
crouched
down
by
the
side
of
the
fire
all
the
gracious
spiritual
light
that
had
been
upon
her
face
was
gone
there
was
something
of
the
goaded
dangerous
sullen
ferocity
of
a
brave
animal
and
her
native
generosity
the
loyal
disinterestedness
of
her
love
for
him
had
overborne
the
jealousy
the
wounded
vanity
and
the
desire
of
vengeance
that
reigned
in
her
carried
away
by
the
first
she
had
for
the
hour
risen
above
the
last
and
allowed
the
nobler
wish
to
serve
and
rescue
him
to
prevail
over
the
baser
egotism
nothing
with
her
was
ever
premeditated
all
was
the
offspring
of
the
caprices
of
the
impulse
of
the
immediate
moment
and
now
the
reaction
followed
she
was
only
sensible
of
the
burning
envy
that
consumed
her
of
this
woman
who
seemed
to
her
more
than
mortal
in
her
wonderful
fair
loveliness
in
her
marvelous
difference
from
everything
of
their
sex
that
the
camp
and
the
barrack
ever
showed
and
i
have
sent
him
to
her
when
i
should
have
fired
my
pistol
into
her
breast
she
thought
as
she
sat
by
the
dying
embers
and
she
remembered
once
more
the
story
of
the
marseilles
fisherwoman
she
understood
that
terrible
vengeance
under
the
hot
southern
sun
beside
the
ruthless
southern
seas
meanwhile
he
who
so
little
knew
or
heeded
how
he
occupied
her
heart
passed
unnoticed
through
the
movements
of
the
military
crowds
crossed
the
breadth
that
parted
the
encampment
from
the
marquees
of
the
generals
and
their
guests
gave
the
countersign
and
approached
unarrested
and
so
far
unseen
save
by
the
sentinels
the
tents
of
the
corona
suite
the
marshal
and
his
male
visitors
were
still
over
their
banquet
wines
she
had
withdrawn
early
on
the
plea
of
fatigue
there
was
no
one
to
notice
his
visit
except
the
men
on
guard
who
concluded
that
he
went
by
command
in
the
dusky
light
for
the
moon
was
very
young
and
the
flare
of
the
torches
made
the
shadows
black
and
uncertain
no
one
recognized
him
the
few
soldiers
stationed
about
saw
one
of
their
own
troopers
and
offered
him
no
opposition
made
him
no
question
he
knew
the
password
that
was
sufficient
the
levantine
waiting
near
the
entrance
drew
the
aside
and
signed
to
him
to
enter
another
moment
and
he
was
in
the
presence
of
her
mistress
in
that
dim
amber
light
from
the
standing
candelabra
in
that
heavy
air
perfumed
from
the
burning
in
a
brazier
through
which
he
saw
half
blinded
at
first
coming
from
the
darkness
without
that
face
which
subdued
and
dazzled
even
the
antagonism
and
the
lawlessness
of
cigarette
he
bowed
low
before
her
preserving
that
distant
ceremonial
due
from
the
rank
he
ostensibly
held
to
hers
madame
this
is
very
merciful
i
know
not
how
to
thank
she
motioned
to
him
to
take
a
seat
near
to
her
while
the
levantine
who
knew
nothing
of
the
english
tongue
retired
to
the
farther
end
of
the
tent
i
only
kept
my
word
she
answered
for
we
leave
the
camp
africa
next
so
soon
she
saw
the
blood
forsake
the
bronzed
fairness
of
his
face
and
leave
the
dusky
pallor
there
it
wounded
her
as
if
she
suffered
herself
for
the
first
time
she
believed
what
the
little
one
had
said
that
this
man
loved
her
i
sent
for
you
she
continued
hurriedly
her
graceful
languor
and
tranquillity
for
the
first
time
stirred
and
quickened
by
emotion
almost
by
embarrassment
it
was
very
strange
it
was
very
painful
for
me
to
trust
that
child
with
such
a
message
but
you
know
us
of
old
you
know
we
do
not
forsake
our
friends
for
considerations
of
or
outward
semblance
we
act
as
we
deem
right
we
do
not
heed
untrue
constructions
there
are
many
things
i
desire
to
say
to
you
she
paused
he
merely
bent
his
head
he
could
not
trust
the
calmness
of
his
voice
in
answer
first
she
continued
i
must
entreat
you
to
allow
me
to
tell
philip
what
i
know
you
can
not
conceive
how
intensely
oppressive
it
becomes
to
me
to
have
any
secret
from
him
i
never
concealed
so
much
as
a
thought
from
my
brother
in
all
my
life
and
to
evade
even
a
mute
question
from
his
brave
frank
eyes
makes
me
feel
a
traitress
to
anything
else
he
muttered
ask
me
anything
else
for
god
sake
do
not
let
him
dream
that
i
live
but
why
you
still
speak
to
me
in
enigmas
moreover
before
we
leave
he
intends
to
seek
you
out
as
what
he
thinks
you
a
soldier
of
france
he
is
interested
by
all
he
hears
of
your
career
he
was
first
interested
by
what
i
told
him
of
you
when
he
saw
the
ivory
carvings
at
my
villa
i
asked
the
little
vivandiere
to
tell
you
this
but
on
second
thoughts
it
seemed
best
to
see
you
myself
once
more
as
i
had
there
was
a
slow
weariness
in
the
utterance
of
the
words
she
had
said
that
she
could
not
reflect
on
leaving
him
to
such
a
fate
as
this
of
his
in
africa
without
personal
suffering
or
without
an
effort
to
induce
him
to
reconsider
his
decision
to
condemn
himself
to
it
for
evermore
that
french
child
she
went
on
rapidly
to
cover
both
the
pain
that
she
felt
and
that
she
dealt
forced
her
entrance
here
in
a
strange
fashion
she
wished
to
see
me
i
suppose
and
to
try
my
courage
too
she
is
a
little
brigand
but
she
had
a
true
and
generous
nature
and
she
loves
you
very
cigarette
he
asked
wearily
his
thoughts
could
not
stay
for
either
the
pity
or
interest
for
her
in
this
moment
oh
no
i
trust
not
i
have
done
nothing
to
win
her
love
and
she
is
a
fierce
little
condottiera
who
disdains
all
such
weakness
she
forced
her
way
in
here
that
was
unpardonable
but
she
seems
to
bear
a
singular
dislike
to
singular
indeed
i
never
saw
her
until
he
answered
nothing
the
conviction
stole
on
him
that
cigarette
hated
her
because
he
loved
her
and
yet
she
brought
you
my
message
pursued
his
companion
that
seems
her
nature
violent
passions
yet
thorough
loyalty
but
time
is
precious
i
must
urge
on
you
what
i
bade
you
come
to
hear
it
is
to
implore
you
to
put
your
trust
your
confidence
in
philip
you
have
acknowledged
to
me
that
you
are
guiltless
no
one
who
knows
what
you
once
were
could
ever
doubt
it
for
an
instant
then
let
him
hear
this
let
him
be
your
judge
as
to
what
course
is
right
and
what
wrong
for
you
to
pursue
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
return
to
europe
knowing
you
are
living
thus
and
leaving
you
to
such
a
fate
what
motive
you
have
to
sentence
yourself
to
such
eternal
banishment
i
am
ignorant
but
all
i
ask
of
you
is
confide
in
him
let
him
learn
that
you
live
let
him
decide
whether
or
not
this
sacrifice
of
yourself
be
needed
his
honor
is
an
punctilious
as
that
of
any
man
on
earth
his
friendship
you
can
never
doubt
why
conceal
anything
from
him
his
eyes
turned
on
her
with
that
dumb
agony
which
once
before
had
chilled
her
to
the
soul
do
you
think
if
i
could
speak
in
honor
i
should
not
tell
you
all
a
flush
passed
over
her
face
the
first
that
the
gaze
of
any
man
had
ever
brought
there
she
understood
him
but
she
said
gently
and
hurriedly
may
it
not
be
that
you
overrate
the
obligations
of
honor
i
know
that
many
a
man
has
inexorably
condemned
himself
to
a
severity
of
rule
that
a
dispassionate
judge
of
his
life
might
deem
very
exaggerated
very
unnecessary
it
is
so
natural
for
an
honorable
man
to
so
dread
that
he
should
do
a
dishonorable
thing
through
or
that
he
may
very
well
overestimate
the
sacrifice
required
of
him
through
what
he
deems
justice
or
generosity
may
it
not
be
so
with
you
i
can
conceive
no
reason
that
can
be
strong
enough
to
require
of
you
such
fearful
surrender
of
every
hope
such
utter
abandonment
of
your
own
her
voice
failed
slightly
over
the
last
words
she
could
not
think
with
calmness
of
the
destiny
that
he
accepted
involuntarily
some
prescience
of
pain
that
would
forever
pursue
her
own
life
unless
his
were
rescued
lent
an
intense
earnestness
almost
entreaty
to
her
argument
she
did
not
bear
him
love
as
yet
she
had
seen
too
little
of
him
too
lately
only
known
him
as
her
equal
but
there
were
in
her
stranger
than
she
knew
a
pity
a
tenderness
a
regret
an
honor
for
him
that
drew
her
toward
him
with
an
indefinable
attraction
and
would
sooner
or
later
warm
and
deepen
into
love
already
it
was
sufficient
though
she
deemed
it
but
compassion
and
friendship
to
make
her
feel
that
an
intolerable
weight
would
be
heavy
on
her
future
if
his
should
remain
condemned
to
this
awful
isolation
and
oblivion
while
she
alone
of
all
the
world
should
know
and
hold
his
secret
he
started
from
her
side
as
he
heard
and
paced
to
and
fro
the
narrow
limits
of
the
tent
like
a
caged
animal
for
the
first
time
it
grew
a
belief
to
him
in
his
thoughts
that
were
he
free
were
he
owner
of
his
heritage
he
could
rouse
her
heart
from
its
long
repose
and
make
her
love
him
with
the
soft
and
passionate
warmth
of
his
dead
arab
mistress
a
thing
that
had
been
so
distant
from
her
negligence
and
her
pride
as
warmth
from
the
diamond
or
the
crystal
he
felt
as
if
the
struggle
would
kill
him
he
had
but
to
betray
his
brother
and
he
would
be
unchained
from
his
torture
he
had
but
to
break
his
word
and
he
would
be
at
liberty
all
the
temptation
that
had
before
beset
him
paled
and
grew
as
naught
beside
this
possibility
of
the
possession
of
her
love
which
dawned
upon
him
now
she
knowing
nothing
of
this
which
moved
him
believed
only
that
he
weighed
her
words
in
hesitation
and
strove
to
turn
the
balance
hear
me
she
said
softly
i
do
not
bid
you
decide
i
only
bid
you
confide
in
philip
in
one
who
as
you
must
well
remember
would
sooner
cut
off
his
own
hand
than
counsel
a
base
thing
or
do
an
unfaithful
act
you
are
guiltless
of
this
charge
under
which
you
left
england
you
endure
it
rather
than
do
what
you
deem
dishonorable
to
clear
yourself
that
is
noble
that
is
great
but
it
is
possible
as
i
say
that
you
may
exaggerate
the
abnegation
required
of
you
whoever
was
the
criminal
should
suffer
yours
is
magnificent
magnanimity
but
it
may
surely
be
also
false
justice
alike
to
yourself
and
the
he
turned
on
her
almost
fiercely
in
the
suffering
she
dealt
him
it
is
it
was
a
madness
a
quixotism
the
wild
unconsidered
act
of
a
fool
what
you
will
but
it
is
done
it
was
done
forever
so
long
ago
when
your
young
eyes
looked
on
me
in
the
pity
of
your
innocent
childhood
i
can
not
redeem
its
folly
now
by
adding
to
it
baseness
i
can
not
change
the
choice
of
a
madman
by
repenting
of
it
with
a
caprice
ah
god
you
do
not
know
what
you
do
how
you
tempt
for
sake
urge
me
no
more
help
me
strengthen
me
to
be
true
to
my
word
do
not
bid
me
do
evil
that
i
may
enter
paradise
through
my
sin
he
threw
himself
down
beside
her
as
the
incoherent
words
poured
out
his
arms
flung
across
the
pile
of
cushions
on
which
he
had
been
seated
his
face
hidden
on
them
his
teeth
clinched
on
his
tongue
till
the
blood
flowed
he
felt
that
if
the
power
of
speech
remained
with
him
he
should
forswear
every
law
that
had
bound
him
to
silence
and
tell
her
all
whatever
the
cost
she
looked
at
him
she
heard
him
moved
to
a
greater
agitation
than
ever
had
had
sway
over
her
for
the
first
time
the
storm
winds
that
swept
by
her
did
not
leave
her
passionless
and
calm
this
man
whole
future
was
in
her
hands
she
could
bid
him
seek
happiness
dishonored
or
cleave
to
honor
and
accept
wretchedness
forever
it
was
a
fearful
choice
to
hold
answer
me
choose
for
me
he
said
vehemently
be
my
law
and
be
my
god
she
gave
a
gesture
almost
of
fear
hush
hush
the
woman
does
not
live
who
should
be
that
to
any
you
shall
be
it
to
me
choose
for
me
i
can
not
you
leave
so
much
in
darkness
and
untold
nothing
that
you
need
know
to
decide
your
choice
for
me
save
one
thing
only
that
i
love
she
shuddered
this
is
madness
what
have
you
seen
of
me
enough
to
love
you
while
my
life
shall
last
and
love
no
other
woman
ah
i
was
but
an
african
trooper
in
your
sight
but
in
my
own
i
was
your
equal
you
only
saw
a
man
to
whom
your
gracious
alms
and
your
gentle
charity
were
to
be
given
as
a
queen
may
stoop
in
mercy
to
a
beggar
but
i
saw
one
who
had
the
light
of
my
old
days
in
her
smile
the
sweetness
of
my
old
joys
in
her
eyes
the
memories
of
my
old
world
in
her
every
grace
and
gesture
you
forget
i
was
nothing
to
you
but
you
were
so
much
to
me
i
loved
you
the
first
moment
that
your
voice
fell
on
my
ear
it
is
madness
oh
yes
i
should
have
said
so
too
in
those
old
years
a
madness
i
would
have
sworn
never
to
feel
but
i
have
lived
a
hard
life
since
then
and
no
men
ever
love
like
those
who
suffer
now
you
know
all
know
the
worst
that
tempts
me
no
famine
no
humiliation
no
obloquy
no
loss
i
have
known
ever
drove
me
so
cruelly
to
buy
back
my
happiness
with
the
price
of
dishonor
as
the
one
desire
to
stand
in
my
rightful
place
before
men
and
be
free
to
strive
with
you
for
what
they
have
not
won
as
she
heard
all
the
warmth
all
the
life
faded
out
of
her
face
it
grew
as
white
as
his
own
and
her
lips
parted
slightly
as
though
to
draw
her
breath
was
oppressive
the
wild
words
overwhelmed
her
with
their
surprise
not
less
than
they
shocked
her
with
their
despair
an
intense
truth
vibrated
through
them
a
truth
that
pierced
her
and
reached
her
heart
as
no
other
such
supplication
ever
had
done
she
had
no
love
for
him
yet
or
she
thought
not
she
was
very
proud
and
resisted
such
passions
but
in
that
moment
the
thought
swept
by
her
that
such
love
might
be
possible
it
was
the
nearest
submission
to
it
she
had
ever
given
she
heard
him
in
unbroken
silence
she
kept
silence
long
after
he
had
spoken
so
far
as
her
courage
and
her
dignity
could
be
touched
with
it
she
felt
something
akin
to
terror
at
the
magnitude
of
the
choice
left
to
her
you
give
me
great
pain
great
surprise
she
murmured
all
i
can
trust
is
that
your
love
is
of
such
sudden
birth
that
it
will
die
as
rapidly
he
interrupted
her
you
mean
that
under
no
circumstances
not
even
were
i
to
possess
my
inheritance
could
you
give
me
any
hope
that
i
might
wake
your
tenderness
she
looked
at
him
full
in
the
eyes
with
the
old
fearless
haughty
instinct
of
refusal
to
all
such
entreaty
which
had
made
her
so
indifferent
and
many
said
so
pitiless
to
all
at
his
gaze
however
her
own
changed
and
softened
grew
shadowed
and
then
wandered
from
him
i
do
not
say
that
i
can
not
tell
the
words
were
very
low
she
was
too
truthful
to
conceal
from
him
what
half
dawned
on
herself
the
possibility
that
more
in
his
presence
and
under
different
circumstances
she
might
feel
her
heart
go
to
him
with
a
warmer
and
a
softer
impulse
than
that
of
friendship
the
heroism
of
his
life
had
moved
her
greatly
his
head
dropped
down
again
upon
his
arms
o
god
it
is
possible
at
least
i
am
blind
mad
make
my
choice
for
me
i
know
not
what
to
the
tears
that
had
gathered
in
her
eyes
fell
slowly
down
over
her
colorless
cheeks
she
looked
at
him
with
a
pity
that
made
her
heart
ache
with
a
sorrow
only
less
than
his
own
the
grief
was
for
him
chiefly
yet
something
of
it
for
herself
some
sense
of
present
bitterness
that
fell
on
her
from
his
fate
some
foreboding
of
future
regret
that
would
inevitably
and
forever
follow
her
when
she
left
him
to
his
loneliness
and
his
misery
smote
on
her
with
a
weightier
pang
than
any
her
caressed
and
cloudless
existence
had
encountered
love
was
dimly
before
her
as
the
possibility
he
called
it
remote
unrealized
still
unacknowledged
but
possible
under
certain
conditions
only
known
as
such
when
it
was
also
impossible
through
circumstances
he
had
suffered
silently
endured
strongly
fought
greatly
these
were
the
only
means
through
which
any
man
could
have
ever
reached
her
sympathy
her
respect
her
tenderness
yet
though
a
very
noble
and
a
very
generous
woman
she
was
also
a
woman
of
the
world
she
knew
that
it
was
not
for
her
to
say
even
thus
much
to
a
man
who
was
in
one
sense
a
stranger
and
who
stood
under
the
accusation
of
a
crime
whose
shadow
he
allowed
to
rest
on
him
unmoved
she
felt
sick
at
heart
she
longed
unutterably
with
a
warmer
longing
than
had
moved
her
previously
to
bid
him
at
all
cost
lay
bare
his
past
and
throw
off
the
imputed
shame
that
lay
on
him
yet
all
the
grand
traditions
of
her
race
forbade
her
to
counsel
the
acceptance
of
an
escape
whose
way
led
through
a
forfeiture
of
honor
choose
for
me
venetia
he
muttered
at
last
once
more
she
rose
with
what
was
almost
a
gesture
of
despair
and
thrust
the
gold
hair
off
her
temples
heaven
help
me
i
can
not
i
dare
not
and
i
am
no
longer
capable
of
being
just
there
was
an
accent
almost
of
passion
in
her
voice
she
felt
that
so
greatly
did
she
desire
his
deliverance
his
justification
his
return
to
all
which
was
his
own
desired
even
his
presence
among
them
in
her
own
world
that
she
could
no
longer
give
him
calm
and
unbiased
judgment
he
heard
and
the
burning
tide
of
a
new
joy
rushed
on
him
checked
almost
ere
it
was
known
by
the
dread
lest
for
her
sake
she
should
ever
give
him
so
much
pity
that
such
pity
became
love
he
started
to
his
feet
and
looked
down
imploringly
into
her
eyes
a
look
under
which
her
own
never
quailed
or
drooped
but
which
they
answered
with
that
same
regard
which
she
had
given
him
when
she
had
declared
her
faith
in
his
innocence
if
i
thought
it
possible
you
could
ever
care
she
moved
slightly
from
him
her
face
was
very
white
still
and
her
voice
though
serenely
sustained
shook
as
it
answered
him
if
i
could
believe
me
i
am
not
a
woman
who
would
bid
you
forsake
your
honor
to
spare
yourself
or
me
let
us
speak
no
more
of
this
what
can
it
avail
except
to
make
you
suffer
greater
things
follow
the
counsels
of
your
own
conscience
you
have
been
true
to
them
hitherto
it
is
not
for
me
or
through
me
that
you
shall
ever
be
turned
aside
from
a
bitter
sigh
broke
from
him
as
he
heard
they
are
noble
words
and
yet
it
is
so
easy
to
utter
so
hard
to
follow
them
if
you
had
one
thought
of
tenderness
for
me
you
could
not
speak
a
flush
passed
over
her
face
do
not
think
me
without
feeling
without
sympathy
pity
these
are
not
she
was
silent
they
were
in
a
sense
nearer
to
love
than
any
emotion
she
had
ever
known
if
you
loved
me
he
pursued
passionately
ah
god
the
very
word
from
me
to
you
sounds
insult
and
yet
there
is
not
one
thought
in
me
that
does
not
honor
you
if
you
loved
me
could
you
stand
there
and
bid
me
drag
on
this
life
forever
nameless
friendless
hopeless
having
all
the
bitterness
but
none
of
the
torpor
of
death
wearing
out
the
doom
of
a
galley
slave
though
guiltless
of
all
crime
why
speak
so
you
are
unreasoning
a
moment
ago
you
implored
me
not
to
tempt
you
to
the
violation
of
what
you
hold
your
honor
because
i
bid
you
be
faithful
to
it
you
deem
me
cruel
heaven
help
me
i
scarce
know
what
i
say
i
ask
you
if
you
were
a
woman
who
loved
me
could
you
decide
thus
these
are
wild
questions
she
murmured
what
can
they
serve
i
believe
that
i
should
i
am
sure
that
i
should
as
it
is
as
your
friend
ah
hush
friendship
is
crueler
than
cruel
yes
the
worst
cruelty
when
we
seek
love
a
stone
proffered
us
when
we
ask
for
bread
in
famine
there
was
desperation
almost
ferocity
in
the
answer
she
was
moved
and
shaken
by
it
not
to
fear
for
fear
was
not
in
her
nature
but
to
something
of
awe
and
something
of
the
despairing
hopelessness
that
was
in
him
lord
royallieu
she
said
slowly
as
if
the
familiar
name
were
some
tie
between
them
some
cause
of
excuse
for
these
the
only
love
words
she
had
ever
heard
without
disdain
and
rejection
lord
royallieu
it
is
unworthy
of
you
to
take
this
advantage
of
an
interview
which
i
sought
and
sought
for
your
own
sake
you
pain
me
you
wound
me
i
can
not
tell
how
to
answer
you
you
speak
strangely
and
without
he
stood
mute
and
motionless
before
her
his
head
sunk
on
his
chest
he
knew
that
she
rebuked
him
justly
he
knew
that
he
had
broken
through
every
law
he
had
prescribed
himself
and
that
he
had
sinned
against
the
code
of
chivalry
which
should
have
made
her
sacred
from
such
words
while
they
were
those
he
could
not
utter
nor
she
hear
except
in
secrecy
and
shame
unless
he
could
stand
justified
in
her
sight
and
in
that
of
all
men
he
had
no
right
to
seek
to
wring
out
tenderness
from
her
regret
and
from
her
pity
yet
all
his
heart
went
out
to
her
in
one
irrepressible
entreaty
forgive
me
for
pity
sake
after
i
shall
never
look
upon
your
face
i
do
forgive
she
said
gently
while
her
voice
grew
very
sweet
you
endure
too
much
already
for
one
needless
pang
to
be
added
by
me
all
i
wish
is
that
you
had
never
met
me
so
that
this
last
worst
thing
had
not
come
unto
you
a
long
silence
fell
between
them
where
she
leaned
back
among
her
cushions
her
face
was
turned
from
him
he
stood
motionless
in
the
shadow
his
head
still
dropped
upon
his
breast
his
breathing
loud
and
slow
and
hard
to
speak
of
love
to
her
was
forbidden
to
him
yet
the
insidious
temptation
wound
close
and
closer
round
his
strength
he
had
only
to
betray
the
man
he
had
sworn
to
protect
and
she
would
know
his
innocence
she
would
hear
his
passion
he
would
be
free
and
she
he
grew
giddy
as
the
thought
rose
before
him
she
might
with
time
be
brought
to
give
him
other
tenderness
than
that
of
friendship
he
seemed
to
touch
the
very
supremacy
of
joy
to
reach
it
almost
with
his
hand
to
have
honors
and
peace
and
all
the
glory
of
her
haughty
loveliness
and
all
the
sweetness
of
her
subjugation
and
all
the
soft
delights
of
passions
before
him
in
their
golden
promise
and
he
was
held
back
in
bands
of
iron
he
was
driven
out
from
them
desolate
and
accursed
unlike
cain
he
had
suffered
in
his
brother
stead
yet
like
cain
he
was
branded
and
could
only
wander
out
into
the
darkness
and
the
wilderness
she
watched
him
many
minutes
he
unconscious
of
her
gaze
and
while
she
did
so
many
conflicting
emotions
passed
over
the
colorless
delicacy
of
her
features
her
eyes
were
filled
and
shadowed
with
many
altering
thoughts
her
heart
was
waking
from
its
rest
and
the
high
generous
unselfish
nature
in
her
strove
with
her
pride
of
birth
her
dignity
of
habit
wait
she
said
softly
with
the
old
imperial
command
of
her
voice
subdued
though
not
wholly
banished
i
think
you
have
mistaken
me
somewhat
you
wrong
me
if
you
think
that
i
could
be
so
callous
so
indifferent
as
to
leave
you
here
without
heed
as
to
your
fate
believe
in
your
innocence
you
know
that
i
do
as
firmly
as
though
you
substantiated
it
with
a
thousand
proofs
reverence
your
devotion
to
your
honor
you
are
certain
that
i
must
or
all
better
things
were
dead
in
her
voice
sank
inaudible
for
the
instant
she
recovered
her
with
an
effort
you
reject
my
friendship
you
term
it
cruel
but
at
least
it
will
be
faithful
to
you
too
faithful
for
me
to
pass
out
of
africa
and
never
give
you
one
thought
again
i
believe
in
you
do
you
not
know
that
that
is
the
highest
trust
to
my
thinking
that
one
human
life
can
show
in
another
you
decide
that
it
is
your
duty
not
to
free
yourself
from
this
bondage
not
to
expose
the
actual
criminal
not
to
take
up
your
rights
of
birth
i
dare
not
seek
to
alter
that
decision
but
i
can
not
leave
you
to
such
a
future
without
infinite
pain
and
there
must
there
shall
be
means
through
which
you
will
let
me
hear
of
you
through
which
at
least
i
can
know
that
you
are
she
stretched
her
hands
toward
him
with
that
same
gesture
with
which
she
had
first
declared
her
faith
in
his
guiltlessness
the
tears
trembled
in
her
voice
and
swam
in
her
eyes
as
she
had
said
she
suffered
for
him
exceedingly
he
hearing
those
words
which
breathed
the
only
pity
that
had
ever
humiliated
him
and
the
loyal
trust
which
was
but
the
truer
because
the
sincerity
of
faith
in
lieu
of
the
insanity
of
love
dictated
it
made
a
blind
staggering
unconscious
movement
of
passionate
dumb
agony
he
seized
her
hands
in
his
and
held
them
close
against
his
breast
one
instant
against
the
loud
hard
panting
of
his
aching
heart
god
reward
you
god
keep
you
if
i
stay
i
shall
tell
you
all
let
me
go
and
forget
that
we
ever
met
i
am
dead
let
me
be
dead
to
you
with
another
instant
he
had
left
the
tent
and
passed
out
into
the
red
glow
of
the
torchlit
evening
and
venetia
corona
dropped
her
proud
head
down
upon
the
silken
cushions
where
his
own
had
rested
and
wept
as
women
weep
over
their
dead
in
such
a
passion
as
had
never
come
to
her
in
all
the
course
of
her
radiant
victorious
and
imperious
life
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
seen
him
slain
in
cold
blood
and
had
never
lifted
her
hand
or
her
voice
against
his
murder
his
voice
rang
in
her
ear
his
face
was
before
her
with
its
white
still
rigid
anguish
the
burning
accents
of
his
avowal
of
love
seemed
to
search
her
very
heart
if
this
man
perished
in
any
of
the
thousand
perils
of
war
she
would
forever
feel
herself
his
assassin
she
had
his
secret
she
had
his
soul
she
had
his
honor
in
her
hands
and
she
could
do
nothing
better
for
them
both
than
to
send
him
from
her
to
eternal
silence
to
eternal
solitude
her
thoughts
grew
unbearable
she
rose
impetuously
from
her
couch
and
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
narrow
confines
of
her
tent
her
tranquillity
was
broken
down
her
pride
was
abandoned
her
heart
at
length
was
reached
and
sorely
wounded
the
only
man
she
had
ever
found
whom
it
would
have
been
possible
to
her
to
have
loved
was
one
already
severed
from
her
by
a
fate
almost
more
hideous
than
death
and
yet
in
her
loneliness
the
color
flushed
back
into
her
face
her
eyes
gathered
some
of
their
old
light
one
dreaming
shapeless
fancy
floated
vaguely
through
her
mind
if
in
the
years
to
come
she
knew
him
in
all
ways
worthy
and
learned
to
give
him
back
this
love
he
bore
her
it
was
in
her
to
prove
that
love
no
matter
what
cost
to
her
pride
and
her
lineage
if
his
perfect
innocence
were
made
clear
in
her
own
sight
there
was
greatness
and
there
was
unselfishness
enough
in
her
nature
to
make
her
capable
of
regarding
alone
his
martyrdom
and
his
heroism
and
disregarding
the
opinion
of
the
world
if
hereafter
she
grew
to
find
his
presence
the
necessity
of
her
life
and
his
sacrifice
of
that
nobility
and
of
that
purity
she
now
believed
it
she
proud
as
she
was
with
the
twin
pride
of
lineage
and
of
nature
would
be
capable
of
incurring
the
odium
and
the
marvel
of
all
who
knew
her
by
uniting
her
fate
to
his
own
by
making
manifest
her
honor
and
her
tenderness
for
him
though
men
saw
in
him
only
a
soldier
of
the
empire
only
a
trooper
beneath
her
as
riom
beneath
the
daughter
of
she
was
of
a
brave
nature
of
a
great
nature
of
a
daring
courage
and
of
a
superb
generosity
abhorring
dishonor
full
of
glory
in
the
stainless
history
of
her
race
and
tenacious
of
the
dignity
and
of
the
magnitude
of
her
house
she
yet
was
too
courageous
and
too
haughty
a
woman
not
to
be
capable
of
braving
calumny
if
conscious
of
her
own
pure
rectitude
beneath
it
not
to
be
capable
of
incurring
false
censure
if
encountered
in
the
path
of
justice
and
of
magnanimity
it
was
possible
even
on
herself
it
dawned
as
possible
that
so
great
might
become
her
compassion
and
her
tenderness
for
this
man
that
she
would
in
some
distant
future
when
the
might
of
his
love
and
the
severity
of
his
suffering
should
prevail
with
her
say
to
him
keep
your
secret
from
the
world
as
you
will
prove
your
innocence
only
to
me
let
me
and
the
friend
of
your
youth
alone
know
your
name
and
your
rights
and
knowing
all
knowing
you
myself
to
be
hero
and
martyr
in
one
i
shall
not
care
what
the
world
thinks
of
you
what
the
world
says
of
me
i
will
be
your
wife
i
have
lands
and
riches
and
honors
and
greatness
enough
to
suffice
for
us
if
ever
she
loved
him
exceedingly
she
would
become
capable
of
this
sacrifice
from
the
strength
and
the
graciousness
and
the
fearlessness
of
her
nature
and
such
love
was
not
so
distant
from
her
as
she
thought
outside
her
tent
there
was
a
peculiar
mingling
of
light
and
shadow
of
darkness
from
the
moonless
and
now
sky
of
reddened
warmth
from
the
tall
burning
thrust
into
the
soil
in
lieu
of
other
illumination
the
atmosphere
was
hot
from
the
flames
and
chilly
with
the
breath
of
the
night
winds
it
was
oppressively
still
though
from
afar
off
the
sounds
of
laughter
in
the
camp
still
echoed
and
near
at
hand
the
dull
and
steady
tramp
of
the
sentinels
fell
on
the
hard
parched
soil
into
that
blended
heat
and
cold
dead
blackness
and
burning
glare
he
reeled
out
from
her
presence
drunk
with
pain
as
deliriously
as
men
grow
drunk
with
raki
the
challenge
rang
on
the
air
who
goes
there
he
never
heard
it
even
the
old
habits
of
a
obedience
were
killed
in
him
who
goes
there
the
challenge
rang
again
still
he
never
heard
but
went
on
blindly
from
where
the
tents
stood
there
was
a
stronger
breadth
of
light
through
which
he
had
passed
and
was
passing
still
a
light
strong
enough
for
it
to
be
seen
whence
he
came
but
not
strong
enough
to
show
his
features
halt
or
i
fire
the
sentinel
brought
the
weapon
to
his
shoulder
and
took
a
calm
close
sure
aim
he
did
not
speak
the
password
he
had
forgotten
as
though
he
had
never
heard
or
never
given
it
another
figure
than
that
of
the
soldier
on
guard
came
out
of
the
shadow
and
stood
between
him
and
the
sentinel
it
was
that
of
chateauroy
he
was
mounted
on
his
gray
horse
and
wrapped
in
his
military
cloak
about
to
go
the
round
of
the
cavalry
camp
their
eyes
met
in
the
wavering
light
like
the
glow
from
a
in
a
glance
they
knew
each
other
it
is
one
of
my
men
said
the
chief
carelessly
to
the
sentinel
leave
me
to
deal
with
the
guard
saluted
and
resumed
his
beat
why
did
you
refuse
the
word
sir
i
did
not
there
was
no
reply
why
are
you
absent
from
your
squadron
there
was
no
reply
still
have
you
no
tongue
sir
the
stick
shall
soon
make
you
speak
why
are
you
here
there
was
again
no
answer
chateauroy
teeth
ground
out
a
furious
oath
yet
a
flash
of
brutal
delight
glittered
in
his
eyes
at
last
he
had
hounded
down
this
man
so
long
out
of
his
reach
into
disobedience
and
contumacy
why
are
you
here
and
where
have
you
been
he
demanded
once
more
i
will
not
the
answer
given
at
length
was
tranquil
low
slowly
and
distinctly
uttered
in
a
deliberate
refusal
in
a
deliberate
defiance
the
dark
and
evil
countenance
above
him
grew
livid
with
fury
i
can
have
you
thrashed
like
a
dog
for
that
answer
and
i
will
but
first
listen
here
beau
sire
i
know
as
well
as
though
you
had
confessed
to
me
your
silence
can
not
shelter
your
great
mistress
shame
ah
ha
so
mme
la
princesse
is
so
cold
to
her
equals
only
to
choose
her
lovers
out
of
my
blackguards
and
take
her
midnight
intrigues
like
a
camp
courtesan
cecil
face
changed
terribly
as
the
vile
words
were
spoken
with
the
light
and
rapid
spring
of
a
leopard
he
reached
the
side
of
his
commander
one
hand
on
the
horse
mane
the
other
on
the
wrists
of
his
chief
that
it
gripped
like
an
iron
vise
you
lie
and
you
know
that
you
lie
breathe
her
name
once
more
and
by
god
as
we
are
both
living
men
i
will
have
your
life
for
your
outrage
and
as
he
spoke
with
his
left
hand
he
smote
the
lips
that
had
blasphemed
against
her
it
was
broken
asunder
at
last
all
the
long
and
bitter
patience
all
the
calm
and
resolute
endurance
all
the
undeviating
serenity
beneath
provocation
which
had
never
yielded
through
twelve
long
years
but
which
had
borne
with
infamy
and
with
tyranny
with
such
absolute
submission
for
sake
of
those
around
him
who
would
revolt
at
his
sign
and
be
slaughtered
for
his
cause
the
promise
he
had
given
to
endure
all
things
for
their
sakes
the
sakes
of
his
soldiery
of
his
comrades
was
at
last
forgotten
all
he
remembered
was
the
vileness
that
dared
touch
her
name
the
shame
that
through
him
was
breathed
on
her
rank
duty
bondage
consequence
all
were
forgotten
in
that
one
instant
of
insult
that
mocked
in
its
odious
lie
at
her
purity
he
was
no
longer
the
soldier
bound
in
obedience
to
submit
to
the
indignities
that
his
chief
chose
to
heap
on
him
he
was
a
gentleman
who
defended
a
woman
honor
a
man
who
avenged
a
slur
on
the
life
that
he
loved
chateauroy
wrenched
his
wrist
out
of
the
hold
that
crushed
it
and
drew
his
pistol
cecil
knew
that
the
laws
of
active
service
would
hold
him
but
justly
dealt
with
if
the
shot
laid
him
dead
in
that
instant
for
his
act
and
his
words
you
can
kill
me
i
know
it
well
use
your
prerogative
it
will
be
the
sole
good
you
have
ever
done
to
and
he
stood
erect
patient
motionless
looking
into
his
chief
eyes
with
a
calm
disdain
with
an
unuttered
challenge
that
for
the
first
moment
wrung
something
of
savage
respect
and
of
sullen
admiration
out
from
the
soul
of
his
great
foe
he
did
not
fire
it
was
the
only
time
in
which
any
trait
of
abstinence
from
cruelty
had
been
ever
seen
in
him
he
signed
to
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
still
covered
with
his
pistol
the
man
whom
martial
law
would
have
allowed
him
to
have
shot
down
or
have
cut
down
at
his
horse
feet
arrest
him
he
said
simply
cecil
offered
no
resistance
he
let
them
seize
and
disarm
him
without
an
effort
at
the
opposition
which
could
have
been
but
a
futile
unavailing
trial
of
brute
force
he
dreaded
lest
there
should
be
one
sound
that
should
reach
her
in
that
tent
where
the
triad
of
standards
drooped
in
the
dusky
distance
he
had
been
moreover
too
long
beneath
the
yoke
of
that
despotic
and
irresponsible
authority
to
waste
breath
or
to
waste
dignity
in
vain
contest
with
the
absolute
and
the
immutable
he
was
content
with
what
he
had
done
content
to
have
met
once
not
as
soldier
to
chief
but
as
man
to
man
the
tyrant
who
held
his
fate
for
once
beneath
the
spur
of
that
foul
outrage
to
the
dignity
and
the
innocence
of
the
woman
he
had
quitted
he
had
allowed
a
passionate
truth
to
force
its
way
through
the
barriers
of
rank
and
the
bonds
of
subservience
insult
to
himself
he
had
borne
as
the
base
prerogative
of
his
superior
but
insult
to
her
he
had
avenged
with
the
vengeance
of
equal
to
equal
of
the
man
who
loved
on
the
man
who
calumniated
her
and
as
he
sat
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
with
the
heavy
tramp
of
his
guards
forever
on
his
ear
there
was
peace
rather
than
rebellion
in
his
heart
the
peace
of
one
heartsick
with
strife
and
with
temptation
who
beholds
in
death
a
merciful
ending
to
the
ordeal
of
existence
i
shall
die
in
her
cause
at
least
he
thought
i
could
be
content
if
i
were
only
sure
that
she
would
never
for
this
was
the
chief
dread
which
hung
on
him
that
she
should
ever
know
and
in
knowing
suffer
for
his
sake
the
night
rolled
on
the
army
around
him
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
chateauroy
conscious
of
his
own
coarse
guilt
against
the
guest
of
his
marshal
kept
the
matter
untold
and
undiscovered
under
the
plea
that
he
desired
not
to
destroy
the
harmony
of
the
general
rejoicing
the
one
or
two
with
whom
he
took
counsel
agreed
to
the
wisdom
of
letting
the
night
pass
away
undisturbed
the
accused
was
the
idol
of
his
own
squadron
there
was
no
gauge
what
might
not
be
done
by
troops
heated
with
excitement
and
drunk
with
wine
if
they
knew
that
their
favorite
comrade
had
set
the
example
of
insubordination
and
would
be
sentenced
to
suffer
for
it
beyond
these
and
the
men
employed
in
his
arrest
and
guard
none
knew
what
had
chanced
not
the
soldiery
beneath
that
vast
sea
of
canvas
many
of
whom
would
have
rushed
headlong
to
mutiny
and
to
destruction
at
his
word
not
the
woman
who
in
the
solitude
of
her
wakeful
hours
was
haunted
by
the
memory
of
his
and
felt
steal
on
her
the
unacknowledged
sense
that
if
his
future
were
left
to
misery
happiness
could
never
more
touch
her
own
not
the
friend
of
his
early
days
laughing
and
drinking
with
the
officers
of
the
staff
none
knew
not
even
cigarette
she
sat
alone
so
far
away
that
none
sought
her
out
beside
the
that
had
long
died
out
with
the
little
white
dog
of
zaraila
curled
on
the
scarlet
folds
of
her
skirt
her
arms
rested
on
her
knees
and
her
temples
leaned
on
her
hands
tightly
twisted
among
the
dark
silken
curls
of
her
boyish
hair
her
face
had
the
same
dusky
savage
intensity
upon
it
and
she
never
once
moved
from
that
rigid
attitude
she
had
the
cross
on
her
heart
the
idol
of
her
long
desire
the
star
to
which
her
longing
eyes
had
looked
up
ever
since
her
childhood
through
the
reek
of
carnage
and
the
smoke
of
battle
and
she
would
have
flung
it
away
like
dross
to
have
had
his
lips
touch
hers
once
with
love
and
she
knew
herself
mad
for
the
desires
and
the
delights
of
love
die
swiftly
but
the
knowledge
of
honor
abides
always
love
would
have
made
her
youth
sweet
with
an
unutterable
gladness
to
glide
from
her
and
leave
her
weary
dissatisfied
forsaken
but
that
cross
the
gift
of
her
country
the
symbol
of
her
heroism
would
be
with
her
always
and
light
her
forever
with
the
honor
of
which
it
was
the
emblem
and
if
her
life
should
last
until
youth
passed
away
and
age
came
and
with
age
death
her
hand
would
wander
to
it
on
her
dying
bed
and
she
would
smile
as
she
died
to
hear
the
living
watchers
murmur
that
life
had
glory
that
life
was
lived
for
she
knew
this
but
she
was
young
she
was
a
she
had
the
ardor
of
passionate
youth
in
her
veins
she
had
the
desolation
of
abandoned
youth
in
her
heart
and
honor
looked
so
cold
beside
love
she
rose
impetuously
the
night
was
far
spent
the
camp
was
very
still
the
torches
had
long
died
out
and
a
streak
of
dawn
was
visible
in
the
east
she
stood
a
while
looking
very
earnestly
across
the
wide
black
city
of
tents
i
shall
be
best
away
for
a
time
i
grow
mad
treacherous
wicked
here
she
thought
i
will
go
and
see
was
the
soldier
of
the
army
of
italy
in
a
brief
while
she
had
saddled
and
bridled
and
ridden
out
of
the
camp
without
warning
or
farewell
to
any
she
was
as
free
to
come
and
to
go
as
though
she
were
a
bird
on
the
wing
thus
she
went
knowing
nothing
of
his
fate
and
with
the
sunrise
went
also
the

loved

ignorance
chapter

the
vengeance
of
the
little
one
the
warm
transparent
light
of
an
african
autumnal
noon
shone
down
through
the
white
canvas
roof
of
a
great
tent
in
the
heart
of
the
encamped
divisions
at
the
headquarters
of
the
army
of
the
south
in
the
tent
there
was
a
densely
packed
throng
an
immense
close
hushed
listening
crowd
of
which
every
man
wore
the
uniform
of
france
of
which
the
mute
undeviating
attention
forbidden
by
discipline
alike
to
be
broken
by
sound
of
approval
or
dissent
had
in
it
something
that
was
almost
terrible
contrasted
with
the
vivid
eagerness
in
their
eyes
and
the
strained
absorption
of
their
countenances
for
they
were
in
court
and
that
court
was
the
council
of
war
of
their
own
southern
camp
the
prisoner
was
arraigned
on
the
heaviest
charge
that
can
be
laid
against
the
soldier
of
any
army
and
yet
as
the
many
eyes
of
the
military
crowd
turned
on
him
where
he
stood
surrounded
by
his
guard
his
crime
against
his
chief
was
forgotten
and
they
only
remembered
zaraila
many
of
those
present
had
seen
him
throughout
that
day
of
blood
at
the
head
of
his
decimated
squadron
with
the
guidon
held
aloft
above
every
foe
to
them
that
tall
slender
form
standing
there
with
a
calm
weary
dignity
that
had
nothing
of
the
passion
of
the
mutinous
or
the
consciousness
of
the
criminal
in
its
serene
repose
had
shed
upon
it
the
luster
of
a
heroism
that
made
them
ready
almost
to
weep
like
women
that
the
death
of
a
mutineer
should
be
the
sole
answer
given
by
france
to
the
savior
of
her
honor
he
preserved
entire
reticence
in
court
the
instant
the
accusation
had
been
read
to
him
he
had
seen
that
his
chief
would
not
dare
to
couple
with
it
the
proud
pure
name
he
had
dared
to
outrage
his
most
bitter
anxiety
was
thus
at
an
end
for
all
the
rest
he
was
tranquil
no
case
could
be
clearer
briefer
less
complex
more
entirely
incapable
of
defense
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
gave
evidence
as
to
the
violence
and
fury
of
the
assault
the
sentinel
bore
witness
to
having
heard
the
refusal
to
reply
a
moment
after
he
had
seen
the
attack
made
and
the
blow
given
the
accuser
merely
stated
that
meeting
his
out
of
the
bounds
of
the
cavalry
camp
he
had
asked
him
where
he
had
been
and
why
he
was
there
and
on
his
commanding
an
answer
had
been
assaulted
in
the
manner
described
with
violence
sufficient
to
have
cost
his
life
had
not
the
guard
been
so
near
at
hand
when
questioned
as
to
what
motive
he
could
assign
for
the
act
he
replied
that
he
considered
his
corporal
had
always
incited
evil
feeling
and
mutinous
conduct
in
the
squadrons
and
had
he
believed
that
day
attributed
to
himself
his
failure
to
receive
the
cross
the
statement
passed
without
contradiction
by
the
prisoner
who
to
the
interrogations
and
entreaties
of
his
legal
defender
only
replied
that
the
facts
were
stated
accurately
as
they
occurred
and
that
his
reasons
for
the
deed
he
declined
to
assert
when
once
more
questioned
as
to
his
country
and
his
past
by
the
president
he
briefly
declined
to
give
answer
when
asked
if
the
names
by
which
he
was
enrolled
were
his
own
he
replied
that
they
were
two
of
his
baptismal
names
which
had
served
his
purpose
on
entering
the
army
when
asked
if
he
accepted
as
true
the
charge
of
exciting
sedition
among
the
troops
he
replied
that
it
was
so
little
true
that
over
and
over
again
the
men
would
have
mutinied
if
he
had
given
them
a
sign
and
that
he
had
continually
induced
them
to
submit
to
discipline
sheerly
by
force
of
his
own
example
when
interrogated
as
to
the
cause
of
the
language
he
had
used
to
his
commanding
officer
he
said
briefly
that
the
language
deserved
the
strongest
censure
as
for
a
soldier
to
his
colonel
but
that
it
was
justified
as
he
had
used
it
which
was
as
man
to
man
though
he
was
aware
the
plea
availed
nothing
in
military
law
and
was
impermissible
for
the
safety
of
the
service
when
it
was
inquired
of
him
if
he
had
not
repeatedly
inveighed
against
his
commanding
officer
for
severity
he
briefly
denied
it
no
man
had
ever
heard
him
say
a
syllable
that
could
have
been
construed
into
complaint
at
the
same
time
he
observed
that
all
the
squadrons
knew
perfectly
well
personal
enmity
and
oppression
had
been
shown
him
by
his
chief
throughout
the
whole
time
of
his
association
with
the
regiment
when
pressed
as
to
the
cause
that
he
assigned
for
this
he
gave
in
a
few
comprehensive
outlines
the
story
of
the
capture
and
the
deliverance
of
the
emir
bride
this
was
all
that
could
be
elicited
from
him
and
even
this
was
answered
only
out
of
deference
to
the
authority
of
the
court
and
from
his
unwillingness
even
now
to
set
a
bad
example
before
the
men
with
whom
he
had
served
so
long
when
it
was
finally
demanded
of
him
if
he
had
aught
to
urge
in
his
own
extenuation
he
paused
a
moment
with
a
gaze
under
which
even
the
hard
eagle
eyes
grew
restless
looked
across
to
chateauroy
and
addressed
his
antagonist
rather
than
the
president
only
this
that
a
tyrant
a
liar
and
a
traducer
can
not
wonder
if
men
prefer
death
to
submission
beneath
insult
but
i
am
well
aware
this
is
no
vindication
of
my
act
as
a
soldier
and
i
have
no
desire
to
say
words
which
whatever
their
truth
might
become
hereafter
dangerous
legacies
and
dangerous
precedents
to
the
that
was
all
which
he
answered
and
neither
his
counsel
nor
his
accusers
could
extort
another
syllable
from
him
he
knew
that
what
he
had
done
was
justified
to
his
own
conscience
but
he
did
not
seek
to
dispute
that
it
was
unjustifiable
in
military
law
true
had
all
been
told
it
was
possible
enough
that
his
judges
would
exonerate
him
morally
even
if
they
condemned
him
legally
his
act
would
be
seen
blameless
as
a
man
even
while
still
punishable
as
a
soldier
but
to
purchase
immunity
for
himself
at
the
cost
of
bringing
the
fairness
of
her
fame
into
the
coarse
babble
of
men
tongues
was
an
alternative
craven
and
shameful
which
never
even
once
glanced
across
his
thoughts
he
had
kept
faith
to
a
woman
whom
he
had
known
heartless
and
worthless
it
was
not
to
the
woman
whom
he
loved
with
all
the
might
of
an
intense
passion
and
whom
he
knew
pure
and
glorious
as
the
morning
sun
that
he
would
break
his
faith
now
all
through
the
three
days
that
the
council
sat
his
look
and
his
manner
never
changed
the
first
was
quite
calm
though
very
weary
the
latter
courteous
but
resolute
with
the
unchanged
firmness
of
one
who
knew
his
own
past
action
justified
for
the
rest
many
noticed
that
during
the
chief
of
the
long
exhausting
hours
of
his
examination
and
his
trial
his
thoughts
seemed
far
away
and
he
appeared
to
recall
them
to
the
present
with
difficulty
and
with
nothing
of
the
vivid
suspense
of
an
accused
whose
life
and
death
swung
in
the
in
truth
he
had
no
dread
as
he
had
no
hope
left
he
knew
well
enough
that
by
the
blow
which
had
vindicated
her
honor
he
had
forfeited
his
own
existence
all
he
wished
was
that
his
sentence
had
been
dealt
without
this
formula
of
debate
and
of
delay
which
could
have
issue
but
in
one
end
there
was
not
one
man
in
court
who
was
not
more
moved
than
he
more
quick
to
terror
and
regret
for
his
doom
to
many
among
his
comrades
who
had
learned
to
love
the
gentle
silent
aristocrat
who
bore
every
hardship
so
patiently
and
humanized
them
so
imperceptibly
by
the
simple
force
of
an
unvaunted
example
those
three
days
were
torture
wild
brutal
brigands
whose
year
was
one
long
razzia
of
plunder
rapine
and
slaughter
felt
their
lips
tremble
like
young
girls
when
they
asked
how
the
issue
went
for
him
and
the
marauders
who
thought
as
little
of
assassination
for
a
hidden
pot
of
gold
as
butchers
of
drawing
a
knife
across
a
sheep
throat
grew
still
and
with
a
great
awe
when
the
muttering
passed
through
the
camp
that
they
would
see
no
more
among
their
ranks
that
woman
face
which
they
had
beheld
so
often
foremost
in
the
fight
with
a
look
on
it
that
thrilled
their
hearts
like
their
forbidden
chant
of
the
marseillaise
for
when
the
third
day
closed
they
knew
that
he
must
die
there
were
men
hard
as
steel
ravenous
of
blood
as
vultures
who
when
they
heard
that
sentence
given
choked
great
deep
sobs
down
into
the
cavernous
depths
of
their
broad
seared
sinewy
breasts
but
he
never
gave
sigh
or
sign
he
never
moved
once
while
the
decree
of
death
was
read
to
him
and
there
was
no
change
in
the
weary
calmness
of
his
eyes
he
bent
his
head
in
acquiescence
bien
he
said
simply
it
seemed
well
to
him
dead
his
secret
would
lie
in
the
grave
with
him
and
the
long
martyrdom
of
his
life
be
ended
in
the
brightness
of
the
noon
cigarette
leaned
out
of
her
little
oval
casement
that
framed
her
head
like
an
old
black
oak
carving
a
head
with
the
mellow
bloom
on
its
cheeks
and
the
flash
of
scarlet
above
its
dark
curls
and
the
grace
of
poise
and
balance
as
it
hung
out
there
in
the
sun
cigarette
had
been
there
a
whole
hour
in
thought
she
who
never
had
wasted
a
moment
in
meditation
or
reverie
and
who
found
the
long
african
day
all
too
short
for
her
busy
abundant
joyous
life
that
was
always
full
of
haste
and
work
just
as
a
bird
will
seem
so
though
the
bird
have
no
more
to
do
than
to
fly
at
its
will
through
summer
air
and
feed
at
its
will
from
brook
and
from
berry
from
a
ripe
ear
of
the
corn
or
from
a
deep
cup
of
the
lily
for
the
first
time
she
was
letting
time
drift
away
in
the
fruitless
labor
of
vain
purposeless
thought
because
for
the
first
time
also
happiness
was
not
with
her
they
were
gone
forever
all
the
elastic
joyance
all
the
free
fair
hours
all
the
dauntless
gayety
of
childhood
all
the
sweet
harmonious
laughter
of
a
heart
without
a
care
they
were
gone
forever
for
the
touch
of
love
and
of
pain
had
been
laid
on
her
and
never
again
would
her
radiant
eyes
smile
cloudlessly
like
the
young
eagle
at
a
sun
that
rose
but
to
be
greeted
as
only
youth
can
great
another
dawn
of
life
that
is
without
a
shadow
and
she
leaned
wearily
there
with
her
cheek
lying
on
the
cold
gray
moorish
stone
the
color
and
the
brightness
were
in
the
rays
of
the
light
in
the
rich
hues
of
her
hair
and
her
mouth
in
the
scarlet
glow
of
her
dress
there
was
no
brightness
in
her
face
the
eyes
were
vacant
as
they
watched
the
green
lizard
glide
over
the
wall
beyond
and
the
lips
were
parted
with
a
look
of
unspeakable
fatigue
the
tire
not
of
the
limbs
but
of
the
heart
she
had
come
thither
hoping
to
leave
behind
her
on
the
desert
wind
that
alien
care
that
new
strange
passion
which
sapped
her
strength
and
stung
her
pride
and
made
her
evil
with
such
murderous
lust
of
vengeance
and
they
were
with
her
still
only
something
of
the
deadly
biting
ferocity
of
jealousy
had
changed
into
a
passionate
longing
to
be
as
that
woman
was
who
had
his
love
into
a
certain
hopeless
sickening
sense
of
having
forever
lost
that
which
alone
could
have
given
her
such
beauty
and
such
honor
in
the
sight
of
men
as
those
this
woman
had
to
her
it
seemed
impossible
that
this
patrician
who
had
his
passion
should
not
return
it
to
the
child
of
the
camp
though
she
often
mocked
at
caste
all
the
inexorable
rules
all
the
reticent
instincts
of
caste
were
things
unknown
she
would
have
failed
to
comprehend
all
the
thousand
reasons
which
would
have
forbidden
any
bond
between
the
great
aristocrat
and
a
man
of
low
grade
and
of
dubious
name
she
only
thought
of
love
as
she
had
always
seen
it
quickly
born
hotly
cherished
wildly
indulged
and
without
tie
or
restraint
and
i
came
without
my
vengeance
she
mused
to
the
nature
that
felt
the
ferocity
of
the
vendetta
a
right
and
a
due
there
was
wounding
humiliation
in
her
knowledge
that
she
had
left
her
rival
unharmed
and
had
come
hither
out
from
his
sight
and
his
presence
lest
he
should
see
in
her
one
glimpse
of
that
folly
which
she
would
have
killed
herself
under
her
own
steel
rather
than
have
been
betrayed
either
for
his
contempt
or
his
compassion
and
i
came
without
my
vengeance
she
mused
in
that
oppressive
noon
in
that
gray
and
lonely
place
in
that
lofty
where
there
was
nothing
between
her
and
the
hot
hard
cruel
blue
of
the
heavens
vengeance
looked
the
only
thing
that
was
left
her
the
only
means
whereby
that
void
in
her
heart
could
be
filled
that
shame
in
her
life
be
washed
out
to
love
and
to
love
a
man
who
had
no
love
for
her
whose
eyes
only
beheld
another
face
whose
ears
only
thirsted
for
another
voice
its
degradation
stamped
her
a
traitress
in
her
own
sight
traitress
to
her
code
to
her
pride
to
her
country
to
her
flag
and
yet
at
the
core
of
her
heart
so
tired
a
pang
was
aching
she
who
had
gloried
in
being
the
child
of
the
whole
people
the
daughter
of
the
whole
army
felt
lonely
and
abandoned
as
though
she
were
some
bird
which
an
hour
ago
had
been
flying
in
all
its
joy
among
its
brethren
and
now
maimed
with
one
shot
had
fallen
with
broken
pinion
and
torn
plumage
to
lie
alone
upon
the
sand
and
die
the
touch
of
a
bird
wing
brushing
her
hair
brought
the
dreamy
comparison
to
her
wandering
thoughts
she
started
and
lifted
her
head
it
was
a
blue
one
of
the
many
she
fed
at
that
casement
and
the
swiftest
and
surest
of
several
she
sent
with
messages
for
the
soldiers
between
the
various
stations
and
corps
she
had
forgotten
she
had
left
the
bird
at
the
encampment
she
caressed
it
absently
while
the
tired
creature
sank
down
on
her
bosom
then
only
she
saw
that
there
was
a
letter
beneath
one
wing
she
unloosed
it
and
looked
at
it
without
being
able
to
tell
its
meaning
she
could
not
read
a
word
printed
or
written
military
habits
were
too
strong
with
her
for
the
arrival
not
to
change
her
reverie
into
action
whoever
it
was
for
it
must
be
seen
she
gave
the
pigeon
water
and
grain
then
wound
her
way
down
the
dark
narrow
stairs
through
the
height
of
the
tower
out
into
the
passage
below
she
found
an
old
french
cobbler
sitting
at
a
stall
in
a
casement
stitching
leather
he
was
her
customary
reader
and
scribe
in
this
quarter
she
touched
him
with
the
paper
bon
mathieu
wilt
thou
read
this
to
me
it
is
for
thee
little
one
and
signed
cigarette
nodded
listlessly
is
a
good
lad
and
a
scholar
she
answered
absently
read
on
and
he
read
aloud
is
ill
news
i
send
the
bird
on
a
chance
to
find
thee
struck
the
black
hawk
a
slight
blow
but
with
threat
to
kill
following
it
he
has
been
tried
and
is
to
be
shot
there
is
no
appeal
the
case
is
clear
the
colonel
could
have
cut
him
down
were
that
all
i
thought
you
should
know
we
are
all
sorry
it
was
done
on
the
night
of
the
great
fete
i
am
thy
humble
lover
and
slave
so
the
scrawl
crushed
and
blotted
and
written
with
great
difficulty
ran
in
its
brief
phrases
that
the
slow
muttering
of
the
old
shoemaker
drew
out
in
tedious
length
cigarette
heard
she
never
made
a
movement
or
gave
a
sound
but
all
the
blood
fled
out
of
her
brilliant
face
leaving
it
horribly
blanched
beneath
its
brown
and
her
eyes
distended
senseless
sightless
were
fastened
on
the
old
man
slowly
moving
mouth
read
it
again
she
said
simply
when
all
was
ended
he
started
and
looked
up
at
her
face
the
voice
had
not
one
accent
of
its
own
tone
left
he
obeyed
and
read
it
once
more
to
the
end
then
a
loud
shuddering
sigh
escaped
her
like
the
breath
of
one
stifling
under
flames
shot
she
said
vacantly
shot
her
vengeance
had
come
without
her
once
lifting
her
hand
to
summon
it
the
old
man
rose
hurriedly
child
art
thou
ill
the
blow
was
struck
for
her
she
muttered
it
was
that
night
you
hear
that
night
what
night
thou
lookest
so
strangely
dost
thou
love
this
doomed
soldier
cigarette
laughed
a
laugh
whose
echo
thrilled
horribly
through
the
lonely
moresco
courtway
love
love
i
hated
him
look
you
so
i
said
and
i
longed
for
my
vengeance
it
is
come
she
was
still
a
moment
her
white
parched
mouth
quivering
as
though
she
were
under
physical
torture
her
strained
eyes
fastened
on
the
empty
air
the
veins
in
her
throat
swelling
and
throbbing
till
they
glowed
to
purple
then
she
crushed
the
letter
in
one
hand
and
flew
fleet
as
any
antelope
through
the
streets
of
the
moorish
quarter
and
across
the
city
to
the
quay
the
people
ever
gave
way
before
her
but
now
they
scattered
like
frightened
sheep
from
her
path
there
was
something
that
terrified
them
in
that
bloodless
horror
set
upon
her
face
and
in
that
fury
of
resistless
speed
with
which
she
rushed
upon
her
way
once
only
in
her
headlong
career
through
the
throngs
she
paused
it
was
as
one
face
on
which
the
strong
light
of
the
noontide
poured
came
before
her
the
senseless
look
changed
in
her
eyes
she
wheeled
out
of
her
route
and
stopped
before
the
man
who
had
thus
arrested
her
he
was
leaning
idly
over
the
stall
of
a
turkish
bazaar
and
her
hand
grasped
his
arm
before
he
saw
her
you
have
his
face
she
muttered
what
are
you
to
him
he
made
no
answer
he
was
too
amazed
you
are
of
his
race
she
persisted
you
are
brethren
by
your
look
what
are
you
to
him
to
whom
to
the
man
who
calls
himself
louis
victor
a
chasseur
of
my
army
her
eyes
were
fastened
entirely
on
him
keen
ruthless
fierce
in
this
moment
as
a
hawk
he
grew
pale
and
murmured
an
incoherent
denial
he
sought
to
shake
her
off
first
gently
then
more
rudely
he
called
her
mad
and
tried
to
fling
her
from
him
but
the
lithe
fingers
only
wound
themselves
closer
on
his
arm
be
still
fool
she
muttered
and
there
was
that
in
the
accent
that
lent
a
strange
force
and
dignity
in
that
moment
to
the
careless
and
mischievous
plaything
of
the
soldiery
force
that
overcame
him
dignity
that
overawed
him
you
are
of
his
people
you
have
his
eyes
and
his
look
and
his
features
he
disowns
you
or
you
him
no
matter
which
he
is
of
your
blood
and
he
lies
under
sentence
of
death
do
you
know
that
with
a
stifled
cry
the
other
recoiled
from
her
he
never
doubted
that
she
spoke
the
truth
nor
could
any
who
had
looked
upon
her
face
do
not
lie
to
me
she
said
curtly
it
avails
you
nothing
read
she
thrust
before
him
the
paper
the
pigeon
had
brought
his
hand
trembled
sorely
as
he
held
it
he
believed
in
that
moment
that
this
strange
creature
half
soldier
half
woman
half
brigand
half
child
knew
all
his
story
and
all
his
shame
from
his
brother
shot
he
echoed
hoarsely
as
she
had
done
when
he
had
read
on
to
the
end
shot
oh
my
god
and
i
she
drew
him
out
of
the
thoroughfare
into
a
dark
recess
within
the
bazaar
he
submitting
unresistingly
he
was
filled
with
the
horror
the
remorse
the
overwhelming
shock
of
his
brother
doom
he
will
be
shot
she
said
with
a
strange
calmness
we
shoot
down
many
men
in
our
army
i
knew
him
well
he
was
justified
in
his
act
i
do
not
doubt
but
discipline
will
not
stay
for
that
silence
for
mercy
sake
is
there
no
hope
no
possibility
her
lips
were
parched
like
the
desert
sand
as
her
dry
hard
words
came
through
them
none
his
chief
could
have
cut
him
down
in
the
instant
it
took
place
in
camp
you
feel
this
thing
you
are
of
his
race
then
i
am
his
brother
she
was
silent
looking
at
him
fixedly
it
did
not
seem
to
her
strange
that
she
should
thus
have
met
one
of
his
blood
in
the
crowds
of
algiers
she
was
absorbed
in
the
one
catastrophe
whose
hideousness
seemed
to
eat
her
very
life
away
even
while
her
nerve
and
her
brain
and
her
courage
remained
at
their
keenest
and
strongest
you
are
his
brother
she
said
slowly
so
much
as
an
affirmation
that
his
belief
was
confirmed
that
she
had
learned
both
their
relationship
and
their
history
from
cecil
you
must
go
to
him
he
shook
from
head
to
foot
yes
yes
but
it
will
be
too
late
she
did
not
know
that
the
words
were
cried
out
in
all
the
contrition
of
an
unavailing
remorse
she
gave
them
only
their
literal
significance
and
shuddered
as
she
answered
him
that
you
must
risk
you
must
go
to
him
but
first
i
must
know
more
tell
me
his
name
his
he
was
silent
coward
and
egotist
though
he
was
both
cowardice
and
egotism
were
killed
in
him
under
the
overwhelming
horror
with
which
he
felt
himself
as
truly
by
moral
guilt
a
fratricide
as
though
he
had
stabbed
his
elder
through
the
heart
speak
hissed
cigarette
through
her
clenched
teeth
if
you
have
any
kindness
any
pity
any
love
for
the
man
of
your
blood
who
will
be
shot
there
like
a
dog
do
not
waste
a
second
answer
me
tell
me
he
turned
his
wild
terrified
glance
upon
her
he
had
in
that
moment
no
sense
but
to
seize
some
means
of
reparation
to
declare
his
rights
to
cry
out
to
the
very
stones
of
the
streets
his
own
wrong
and
his
victim
sacrifice
he
is
the
head
of
my
house
he
answered
her
scarce
knowing
what
he
answered
he
should
bear
the
title
that
i
bear
now
he
is
here
in
this
misery
because
he
is
the
most
merciful
the
most
generous
the
most
of
living
souls
if
he
dies
it
is
not
they
who
have
killed
him
it
is
i
she
listened
with
her
face
set
in
that
stern
fixed
resolute
command
which
never
varied
she
neglected
all
that
wonder
or
curiosity
or
interest
would
have
made
her
as
at
any
other
time
she
only
heeded
the
few
great
facts
that
bore
upon
the
fate
of
the
condemned
settle
with
yourself
for
that
sin
she
said
bitterly
your
remorse
will
not
save
him
but
do
the
thing
that
i
bid
you
if
that
remorse
be
sincere
write
me
out
here
that
title
you
say
he
should
bear
and
your
statement
that
he
is
your
brother
and
should
be
the
chief
of
your
house
then
sign
it
and
give
it
to
he
seized
her
hands
and
gazed
with
imploring
eyes
into
her
face
who
are
you
what
are
you
if
you
have
the
power
to
do
it
for
the
love
of
god
rescue
him
it
is
i
who
have
murdered
him
i
who
have
let
him
live
on
in
this
hell
for
my
sake
for
your
sake
she
flung
his
hands
off
her
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
that
glance
of
the
speechless
scorn
the
unutterable
rebuke
of
the
who
would
herself
have
died
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
have
purchased
a
whole
existence
by
a
single
falsehood
or
a
single
cowardice
smote
him
like
a
blow
and
avenged
his
sin
more
absolutely
than
any
public
chastisement
the
courage
and
the
truth
of
a
girl
scorned
his
timorous
fear
and
his
living
lie
his
head
sank
he
seemed
to
shrink
under
her
gaze
his
act
had
never
looked
so
vile
to
him
as
it
looked
now
she
gazed
a
moment
longer
at
him
with
her
mute
and
wondering
disdain
that
there
should
be
on
earth
a
male
life
capable
of
such
fear
and
of
such
ignominy
as
this
then
the
strong
and
rapid
power
in
her
took
its
instant
ascendancy
over
the
weaker
nature
monsieur
i
do
not
know
your
story
i
do
not
want
i
am
not
used
to
men
who
let
others
suffer
for
them
what
i
want
is
your
written
statement
of
your
brother
name
and
station
give
it
he
made
a
gesture
of
consent
he
would
have
signed
away
his
soul
if
he
could
in
the
stupor
of
remorse
which
had
seized
him
she
brought
him
pens
and
paper
from
the
turk
store
and
dictated
what
he
wrote
i
hereby
affirm
that
the
person
serving
in
the
chasseurs
under
the
name
of
louis
victor
is
my
older
brother
bertie
cecil
lawfully
by
inheritance
the
viscount
royallieu
peer
of
england
i
hereby
also
acknowledge
that
i
have
succeeded
to
and
borne
the
title
illegally
under
the
supposition
of
his
death
berkeley
signed
he
wrote
it
mechanically
the
force
of
her
will
and
the
torture
of
his
own
conscience
driving
him
on
an
impulse
to
undo
in
an
instant
the
whole
web
of
falsehood
that
he
had
let
circumstance
weave
on
and
on
to
shelter
him
through
twelve
long
years
he
let
her
draw
the
paper
from
him
and
fold
it
away
in
her
belt
he
watched
her
with
a
curious
dreamy
sense
of
his
own
impotence
against
the
fierce
and
fiery
torrent
of
her
bidding
what
is
it
you
will
do
he
asked
her
the
best
that
shall
lie
in
my
power
do
you
the
can
his
life
yet
be
saved
his
honor
may
his
honor
her
face
had
an
exceeding
beauty
as
she
spoke
though
it
was
stern
and
rigid
still
a
look
that
was
sublime
gleamed
over
it
she
the
waif
and
stray
of
a
dissolute
camp
knew
better
than
the
scion
of
his
own
race
how
the
doomed
man
would
choose
the
vindication
of
his
honor
before
the
rescue
of
his
life
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
as
she
moved
stay
stay
one
word
she
flung
him
off
her
again
this
is
no
time
for
words
go
to
him
coward
and
let
the
balls
that
kill
him
reach
you
too
if
you
have
one
trait
of
manhood
left
in
you
then
swiftly
as
a
swallow
darts
she
quitted
him
and
flew
on
her
headlong
way
down
through
the
pressure
of
the
people
and
the
throngs
of
the
marts
and
the
noise
and
the
color
and
the
movement
of
the
streets
the
sun
was
scarce
declined
from
its
noon
before
she
rode
out
of
the
city
on
a
horse
of
the
spahis
swift
as
the
antelope
and
as
wild
with
her
only
equipment
some
pistols
in
her
holsters
and
a
bag
of
rice
and
a
skin
of
water
slung
at
her
they
asked
her
where
she
went
she
never
answered
the
hoofs
struck
sharp
echoes
out
of
the
rugged
stones
and
the
people
were
scattered
like
chaff
as
she
went
at
full
gallop
down
through
algiers
her
comrades
used
to
see
her
ever
with
some
song
in
the
air
and
some
laugh
on
the
lips
as
she
went
looked
after
her
with
wonder
as
she
passed
them
silent
and
with
her
face
white
and
stern
as
though
the
bright
brown
loveliness
of
it
had
been
changed
to
alabaster
what
is
it
with
the
cigarette
they
asked
each
other
none
could
tell
the
desert
horse
and
his
rider
flew
by
them
as
a
swallow
flies
the
gleam
of
her
cross
and
the
colorless
calm
of
the
childlike
face
that
wore
the
resolve
of
a
napoleon
on
it
were
the
last
they
ever
saw
of
cigarette
all
her
fluent
untiring
speech
was
gone
gone
with
the
rose
hue
from
her
cheek
with
the
laugh
from
her
mouth
with
the
child
joyance
from
her
heart
but
the
brave
stanch
dauntless
spirit
lived
with
a
soldier
courage
with
a
martyr
patience
and
she
rode
straight
through
the
scorch
of
the
midday
sun
along
the
westward
the
dizzy
swiftness
would
have
blinded
most
who
should
have
been
carried
through
the
dry
air
and
under
the
burning
skies
at
that
breathless
and
pauseless
speed
but
she
had
ridden
colts
with
the
skill
of
arabs
themselves
she
had
been
tossed
on
a
holster
from
her
earliest
years
and
had
clung
with
an
infant
hands
in
fearless
glee
to
the
mane
of
roughriders
chargers
she
never
swerved
she
never
sickened
she
was
borne
on
and
on
against
the
hard
hot
currents
of
the
cleft
air
with
only
one
sense
that
she
went
so
slowly
so
slowly
when
with
every
beat
of
the
ringing
hoofs
one
of
the
few
moments
of
a
charmed
life
fled
away
she
had
a
long
route
before
her
she
had
many
leagues
to
travel
and
there
were
but
hours
she
knew
well
left
to
the
man
who
was
condemned
to
death
hours
left
open
for
appeal
no
more
betwixt
the
delivery
and
execution
of
the
sentence
that
delay
was
always
interpreted
by
the
french
code
as
a
delay
extending
from
the
evening
of
the
day
to
the
dawn
of
the
second
day
following
and
some
slight
interval
might
then
ensue
according
as
the
general
in
command
ordained
but
the
hours
was
all
of
which
she
could
be
certain
and
even
of
them
some
must
have
flown
by
since
the
had
been
loosed
to
her
she
could
not
tell
how
long
he
had
to
live
there
were
fifty
miles
between
her
and
her
goal
horse
had
once
covered
that
space
in
three
hours
so
men
of
the
army
of
had
told
her
she
knew
what
they
had
done
she
could
do
once
only
she
paused
to
let
her
horse
lie
a
brief
while
and
cool
his
sides
and
crop
some
short
sweet
grass
that
grew
where
a
cleft
of
water
ran
and
made
the
bare
earth
green
she
sat
quite
motionless
while
he
rested
she
was
keenly
alive
to
all
that
could
best
save
his
strength
and
further
her
travel
but
she
watched
him
during
those
few
minutes
of
rest
and
inaction
with
a
fearful
look
of
hunger
in
her
eyes
the
worst
hunger
that
which
craves
time
and
can
not
seize
it
fast
enough
then
she
mounted
again
and
again
went
on
on
her
flight
she
swept
by
cantonments
villages
soldiers
on
the
march
douairs
of
peaceful
arabs
strings
of
mules
and
camels
caravans
of
merchandise
nothing
arrested
her
she
saw
nothing
that
she
passed
as
she
rode
over
the
hard
shadowless
roads
over
the
weary
monotonous
country
over
the
land
without
verdure
and
without
foliage
the
land
that
yet
has
so
weird
a
beauty
so
irresistible
a
fascination
the
land
to
which
men
knowing
that
death
waits
for
them
in
it
yet
return
with
as
mad
an
infatuation
as
her
lovers
went
back
across
the
waters
to
circe
the
horse
was
reeking
with
smoke
and
foam
and
the
blood
was
coursing
from
his
flanks
as
she
reached
her
destination
at
last
and
threw
herself
off
his
saddle
as
he
sank
faint
and
quivering
to
the
ground
whither
she
had
come
was
to
a
fortress
where
the
marshal
of
france
who
was
the
viceroy
of
africa
had
arrived
that
day
in
his
progress
of
inspection
throughout
the
provinces
soldiers
clustered
round
her
eagerly
beneath
the
gates
and
over
the
fallen
beast
a
thousand
questions
pouring
from
their
curious
tongues
she
pointed
to
the
animal
with
one
hand
to
the
gaunt
pile
of
stone
that
bristled
with
cannon
with
the
other
have
a
care
of
him
and
lead
me
to
the
she
spoke
quietly
but
a
certain
sensation
of
awe
and
fear
moved
those
who
heard
she
was
not
the
child
of
the
army
whom
they
knew
so
well
she
was
a
creature
desperate
mute
as
death
strong
as
steel
above
all
hunted
by
despair
they
hesitated
to
take
her
message
to
do
her
bidding
the
one
whom
she
sought
was
great
and
supreme
here
as
a
king
they
dreaded
to
approach
his
staff
to
ask
his
audience
cigarette
looked
at
them
a
moment
then
loosened
her
cross
and
held
it
out
to
an
adjutant
standing
beneath
the
gates
take
that
to
the
man
who
gave
it
me
tell
him
cigarette
waits
and
with
each
moment
that
she
waits
a
soldier
life
is
lost
go
the
adjutant
took
it
and
went
over
and
over
again
she
had
brought
intelligence
of
an
arab
movement
news
of
a
contemplated
razzia
warning
of
an
internal
revolt
or
tidings
of
an
encounter
on
the
plains
that
had
been
of
priceless
value
to
the
army
which
she
served
it
was
not
lightly
that
cigarette
words
were
ever
received
when
she
spoke
as
she
spoke
now
nor
was
it
impossible
that
she
now
brought
to
them
that
which
would
brook
neither
delay
nor
trifling
she
waited
patiently
all
the
iron
discipline
of
military
life
had
never
bound
her
gay
and
lawless
spirit
down
but
now
she
was
singularly
still
and
mute
only
there
gleamed
thirstily
in
her
eyes
that
fearful
avarice
which
begrudges
every
moment
in
its
flight
as
never
the
miser
grudged
his
hoarded
gold
into
the
robber
grasp
a
few
minutes
and
the
decoration
was
brought
back
to
her
and
her
demand
granted
she
was
summoned
to
the
marshal
presence
it
was
the
ordnance
room
a
long
vast
silent
chamber
filled
with
stands
of
arms
with
all
the
arts
and
appliances
of
war
brought
to
their
uttermost
perfection
and
massed
in
all
the
resource
of
a
great
empire
against
the
sons
of
the
desert
who
had
nothing
to
oppose
to
them
save
the
despair
of
a
perishing
nationality
and
a
stifled
freedom
the
marshal
leaning
against
a
brass
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
in
his
keen
stern
eyes
you
my
young
one
what
brings
you
here
she
came
up
to
him
with
her
rapid
grace
and
he
started
as
he
saw
the
change
upon
her
features
she
was
covered
with
sand
and
dust
and
with
the
animal
foam
the
beating
of
her
heart
from
the
fury
of
the
gallop
had
drained
every
hue
from
her
face
her
voice
was
scarcely
articulate
in
its
breathless
haste
as
she
saluted
him
monsieur
i
have
come
from
algiers
since
noon
from
algiers
he
and
his
officers
echoed
the
name
of
the
city
in
incredulous
amaze
they
knew
how
far
from
them
down
along
the
the
white
town
lay
since
noon
to
rescue
a
life
the
life
of
a
great
soldier
of
a
guiltless
man
he
who
saved
the
honor
of
france
at
zaraila
is
to
die
the
death
of
a
mutineer
at
dawn
what
your
chasseur
a
dusky
scarlet
fire
burned
through
the
pallor
of
her
face
but
her
eyes
never
quailed
and
the
torrent
of
her
eloquence
returned
under
the
pangs
of
shame
that
were
beaten
back
under
the
noble
instincts
of
her
love
mine
since
he
is
a
soldier
of
france
yours
too
by
that
title
i
am
come
here
from
algiers
to
speak
the
truth
in
his
name
and
to
save
him
for
his
own
honor
and
the
honor
of
my
empire
see
here
at
noon
i
have
this
paper
sent
by
a
swift
pigeon
read
it
you
see
how
he
is
to
die
and
why
well
by
my
cross
by
my
flag
by
my
france
i
swear
that
not
a
hair
of
his
head
shall
be
touched
and
not
a
drop
of
blood
in
his
veins
shall
be
shed
he
looked
at
her
astonished
at
the
grandeur
and
the
courage
which
could
come
on
this
child
of
razzias
and
revelries
and
give
to
her
all
the
splendor
of
a
fearless
command
of
some
young
empress
but
his
face
darkened
and
set
sternly
as
he
read
the
paper
it
was
the
greatest
crime
in
the
sight
of
a
proud
soldier
this
crime
against
discipline
of
the
man
for
whom
she
pleaded
you
speak
madly
he
said
with
cold
brevity
the
offense
merits
the
chastisement
i
shall
not
attempt
to
wait
you
will
hear
at
least
monsieur
i
will
hear
you
yes
but
i
tell
you
once
for
all
i
never
change
sentences
that
are
pronounced
by
councils
of
war
and
this
crime
is
the
last
for
which
you
should
attempt
to
plead
for
mercy
with
hear
me
at
least
she
cried
with
passionate
ferocity
the
ferocity
of
a
dumb
animal
wounded
by
a
shot
you
do
not
know
what
this
man
is
how
he
has
had
to
endure
i
do
i
have
watched
him
i
have
seen
the
brutal
tyranny
of
his
chief
who
hated
him
because
the
soldiers
loved
him
i
have
seen
his
patience
his
obedience
his
beneath
insults
that
would
have
driven
any
other
to
revolt
and
murder
i
have
seen
him
i
have
told
you
how
at
zaraila
thinking
never
of
death
or
life
only
of
our
flag
that
he
has
made
his
own
and
under
which
he
has
been
forced
to
lead
the
life
of
a
galley
slave
the
finer
soldier
he
be
the
less
pardonable
his
that
i
deny
if
he
were
a
dolt
a
brute
a
thing
of
wood
as
many
are
he
would
have
no
right
to
vengeance
as
it
is
he
is
a
gentleman
a
hero
a
martyr
may
he
not
forget
for
one
hour
that
he
is
a
slave
look
you
i
have
seen
him
so
tried
that
i
told
him
i
who
love
my
army
better
than
any
living
thing
under
the
sun
that
i
would
forgive
him
if
he
forgot
duty
and
dealt
with
his
tyrant
as
man
to
man
and
he
always
held
his
soul
in
patience
why
not
because
he
feared
death
he
desired
it
but
because
he
loved
his
comrades
and
suffered
in
peace
and
in
silence
lest
through
him
they
should
be
led
into
evil
his
eyes
softened
as
he
heard
her
but
the
inflexibility
of
his
voice
never
altered
it
is
useless
to
argue
with
me
he
said
briefly
i
never
change
a
but
i
say
that
you
shall
as
the
audacious
words
were
flung
forth
she
looked
him
full
in
the
eyes
while
her
voice
rang
with
its
old
imperious
oratory
you
are
a
great
chief
you
are
as
a
monarch
here
you
hold
the
gifts
and
the
grandeur
of
the
empire
but
because
of
that
because
you
are
as
france
in
my
eyes
i
swear
by
the
name
of
france
that
you
shall
see
justice
done
to
him
after
death
if
you
can
not
in
life
do
you
know
who
he
is
this
man
whom
his
comrades
will
shoot
down
at
sunrise
as
they
shoot
down
the
murderer
and
the
ravisher
in
their
crimes
he
is
a
rebellious
soldier
it
is
he
is
not
he
is
a
man
who
vindicated
a
woman
honor
he
is
a
man
who
suffers
in
a
brother
place
he
is
an
aristocrat
exiled
to
a
martyrdom
he
is
a
hero
who
has
never
been
greater
than
he
will
be
great
in
his
last
hour
read
that
what
you
refuse
to
justice
and
mercy
and
courage
and
guiltlessness
you
will
grant
maybe
to
your
she
forced
into
his
hand
the
written
statement
of
cecil
name
and
station
all
the
hot
blood
was
back
in
her
cheek
all
the
fiery
passion
back
in
her
eyes
she
lashed
this
potent
ruler
with
the
scourge
of
her
scorn
as
she
had
lashed
a
drunken
horde
of
plunderers
with
her
whip
she
was
reckless
of
what
she
said
she
was
conscious
only
of
one
thing
the
despair
that
consumed
her
the
french
marshal
glanced
his
eye
on
the
fragment
carelessly
and
coldly
as
he
saw
the
words
he
started
and
read
on
with
wondering
eagerness
royallieu
he
muttered
royallieu
the
name
was
familiar
to
him
he
it
was
who
when
he
had
murmured
that
man
has
the
seat
of
the
english
guards
as
a
chasseur
had
passed
him
had
been
ignorant
that
in
that
chasseur
he
saw
one
whom
he
had
known
in
many
a
scene
of
court
splendor
and
parisian
pleasure
the
years
had
been
many
since
cecil
and
he
had
met
but
not
so
many
but
that
the
name
brought
memories
of
friendship
with
it
and
moved
him
with
a
strange
emotion
he
turned
with
grave
anxiety
to
cigarette
you
speak
strangely
how
came
this
in
your
hands
thus
the
day
that
you
gave
me
the
cross
i
saw
mme
la
princesse
corona
i
hated
her
and
i
went
no
matter
from
her
i
learned
that
he
whom
we
call
louis
victor
was
of
her
rank
was
of
old
friendship
with
her
house
was
exiled
and
nameless
but
for
some
reason
unknown
to
her
she
needed
to
see
him
to
bid
him
farewell
so
she
said
i
took
the
message
for
her
i
sent
him
to
her
voice
grew
husky
and
savage
but
she
forced
her
words
on
with
the
reckless
sacrifice
of
self
that
moved
her
he
went
to
her
tent
alone
at
night
that
was
of
course
whence
he
came
when
chateauroy
met
him
i
doubt
not
the
black
hawk
had
some
foul
thing
to
hint
of
his
visit
and
that
blow
was
struck
for
her
for
her
well
in
the
streets
of
algiers
i
saw
a
man
with
a
face
like
his
own
different
but
the
same
race
look
you
i
spoke
to
him
i
taxed
him
when
he
found
that
the
one
whom
i
spoke
of
was
under
sentence
of
death
he
grew
mad
he
cried
out
that
he
was
his
brother
and
had
murdered
him
that
it
was
for
his
sake
that
the
cruelty
of
this
exile
had
been
borne
that
if
his
brother
perished
he
would
be
his
destroyer
then
i
bade
him
write
down
that
paper
since
these
english
names
were
unknown
to
me
and
i
brought
it
hither
to
you
that
you
might
see
under
his
hand
and
with
your
own
eyes
that
i
have
uttered
the
truth
and
now
is
that
man
to
be
killed
like
a
mad
beast
whom
you
fear
is
that
death
the
reward
france
will
give
for
zaraila
her
eyes
were
fixed
with
a
fearful
intensity
of
appeal
upon
the
stern
face
bent
over
her
her
last
arrow
was
sped
if
this
failed
all
was
over
as
he
heard
he
was
visibly
moved
he
remembered
the
felon
shame
that
in
years
gone
by
had
fallen
across
the
banished
name
of
bertie
cecil
the
history
seemed
clear
as
crystal
to
him
seen
beneath
the
light
shed
on
it
from
other
days
his
hand
fell
heavily
on
the
mort
de
dieu
it
was
his
brother
sin
not
his
there
was
a
long
silence
those
present
who
knew
nothing
of
all
that
was
in
his
memory
felt
instinctively
that
some
dead
weight
of
alien
guilt
was
lifted
off
a
blameless
life
forever
she
drew
a
deep
long
sighing
breath
she
knew
that
he
was
safe
her
hands
unconsciously
locked
on
the
great
chief
arms
her
eyes
looked
up
senselessly
in
their
rapture
and
their
dread
to
his
quick
quick
she
gasped
the
hours
go
so
fast
while
we
speak
here
he
the
words
died
in
her
throat
the
marshal
swung
around
with
a
rapid
sign
to
a
staff
officer
pens
and
ink
instantly
my
brave
child
what
can
we
say
to
you
i
will
send
an
aid
to
arrest
the
execution
of
the
sentence
it
must
be
deferred
till
we
know
the
whole
truth
of
this
if
it
be
as
it
looks
now
he
shall
be
saved
if
the
empire
can
save
him
she
looked
up
in
his
eyes
with
a
look
that
froze
his
very
heart
his
honor
she
muttered
his
honor
if
not
his
life
he
understood
her
he
bowed
his
haughty
head
low
down
to
hers
true
we
will
cleanse
that
if
all
other
justice
be
too
the
answer
was
infinitely
gentle
infinitely
solemn
then
he
turned
and
wrote
his
hurried
order
and
bade
his
aid
go
with
it
without
a
loss
but
cigarette
caught
it
from
his
hand
to
me
to
me
no
other
will
go
so
fast
but
my
child
you
are
worn
out
she
turned
on
him
her
beautiful
wild
eyes
in
which
the
blinding
passionate
tears
were
floating
do
you
think
i
would
tarry
for
that
ah
i
wish
that
i
had
let
them
tell
me
of
god
that
i
might
ask
him
now
to
bless
you
quick
quick
lend
me
your
swiftest
horse
one
that
will
not
tire
and
send
a
second
order
by
your
the
arabs
may
kill
me
as
i
go
and
then
they
will
not
know
he
stooped
and
touched
her
little
brown
scorched
feverish
hand
with
reverence
my
child
africa
has
shown
me
much
heroism
but
none
like
yours
if
you
fall
he
shall
be
safe
and
france
will
know
how
to
avenge
its
she
turned
and
gave
him
one
look
infinitely
sweet
infinitely
eloquent
ah
france
she
said
so
softly
that
the
last
word
was
but
a
sign
of
unutterable
tenderness
the
old
imperishable
early
love
was
not
dethroned
it
was
there
still
before
all
else
france
was
without
rival
with
her
then
without
another
second
pause
she
flew
from
them
and
vaulting
into
the
saddle
of
a
young
horse
which
stood
without
in
the
rode
once
more
at
full
speed
out
into
the
pitiless
blaze
of
the
sun
out
to
the
wasted
desolation
of
the
plains
the
order
of
release
indeed
was
in
her
bosom
but
the
chances
were
as
a
million
to
one
that
she
would
reach
him
with
it
in
time
ere
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
his
life
would
have
set
forever
all
the
horror
of
remorse
was
on
her
to
her
nature
the
bitter
jealousy
in
which
she
had
desired
vengeance
on
him
seemed
to
have
rendered
her
a
murderess
she
loved
him
loved
him
with
an
exceeding
passion
and
only
in
this
extremity
when
it
was
confronted
with
the
imminence
of
death
did
the
fullness
and
the
greatness
of
that
love
make
their
way
out
of
the
petulant
pride
and
the
wounded
vanity
which
had
obscured
them
she
had
been
ere
now
a
child
and
a
hero
beneath
this
blow
which
struck
at
him
she
changed
she
became
a
woman
and
a
martyr
and
she
rode
at
full
speed
through
the
night
as
she
had
done
through
the
daylight
her
eyes
glancing
all
around
in
the
keen
instinct
of
a
trooper
her
hand
always
on
the
butt
of
her
belt
pistol
for
she
knew
well
what
the
danger
was
of
these
lonely
unguarded
untraveled
leagues
that
yawned
in
so
vast
a
distance
between
her
and
her
goal
the
arabs
beaten
but
only
rendered
furious
by
defeat
swept
down
on
to
those
plains
with
the
old
guerrilla
skill
the
old
marvelous
rapidity
she
knew
that
with
every
second
shot
or
steel
might
send
her
reeling
from
her
saddle
that
with
every
moment
she
might
be
surrounded
by
some
desperate
band
who
would
spare
neither
her
sex
nor
her
youth
but
that
intoxication
of
peril
the
she
had
drunk
from
her
infancy
was
all
which
sustained
her
in
that
race
with
death
it
filled
her
veins
with
their
old
heat
her
heart
with
its
old
daring
her
nerves
with
their
old
matchless
courage
but
for
it
she
would
have
dropped
with
terror
and
despair
ere
her
errand
could
be
done
under
it
she
had
the
coolness
the
keenness
the
sagacity
the
sustained
force
and
the
supernatural
strength
of
some
young
hunted
animal
they
might
slay
her
so
that
she
left
perforce
her
mission
unaccomplished
but
no
dread
of
such
a
fate
had
even
an
instant
power
to
appall
her
or
arrest
her
while
there
should
be
breath
in
her
she
would
go
on
to
the
end
there
were
eight
hours
hard
riding
before
her
at
the
swiftest
pace
her
horse
could
make
and
she
was
already
worn
by
the
leagues
already
traversed
although
this
was
nothing
new
that
she
did
now
yet
as
time
flew
on
and
she
flew
with
it
ceaselessly
through
the
dim
solitary
barren
moonlit
land
her
brain
now
and
then
grew
giddy
her
heart
now
and
then
stood
still
with
a
sudden
numbing
faintness
she
shook
the
weakness
off
her
with
the
resolute
scorn
for
it
of
her
nature
and
succeeded
in
its
banishment
they
had
put
in
her
hand
as
she
had
passed
through
the
fortress
gates
a
lance
with
a
lantern
muffled
in
arab
fashion
so
that
the
light
was
unseen
from
before
while
it
streamed
over
herself
to
enable
her
to
guide
her
way
if
the
moon
should
be
veiled
by
clouds
with
that
single
starry
gleam
aslant
on
a
level
with
her
eyes
she
rode
through
the
ghastly
twilight
of
the
plains
now
flooded
with
luster
as
the
moon
emerged
now
engulfed
in
darkness
as
the
stormy
western
winds
drove
the
cirrhi
over
it
but
neither
darkness
nor
light
differed
to
her
she
noted
neither
she
was
like
one
drunk
with
strong
wine
and
she
had
but
one
dread
that
the
power
of
her
horse
would
give
way
under
the
unnatural
strain
made
on
it
and
that
she
would
reach
too
late
when
the
life
she
went
to
save
would
have
fallen
forever
silent
unto
death
as
she
had
seen
the
life
of
marquise
fall
hour
on
hour
league
on
league
passed
away
she
felt
the
animal
quiver
under
the
spur
and
she
heard
the
catch
in
his
panting
breath
as
he
strained
to
give
his
fleetest
and
best
that
told
her
how
ere
long
the
racing
speed
the
extended
gallop
at
which
she
kept
him
would
tell
and
beat
him
down
despite
his
desert
strain
she
had
no
pity
she
would
have
killed
twenty
horses
under
her
to
reach
her
goal
she
was
giving
her
own
life
she
was
willing
to
lose
it
if
by
its
loss
she
did
this
thing
to
save
even
the
man
condemned
to
die
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
she
did
not
spare
herself
and
she
would
have
spared
no
living
thing
to
fulfill
the
mission
that
she
undertook
she
loved
with
the
passionate
blindness
of
her
sex
with
the
absolute
abandonment
of
the
southern
blood
if
to
spare
him
she
must
have
bidden
thousands
fall
she
would
have
given
the
word
for
their
destruction
without
a
moment
pause
once
from
some
screen
of
gaunt
and
barren
rock
a
shot
was
fired
at
her
and
flew
within
a
hair
breadth
of
her
brain
she
never
even
looked
around
to
see
whence
it
had
come
she
knew
it
was
from
some
arab
prowler
of
the
plains
her
single
spark
of
light
through
the
lantern
passed
as
swiftly
as
a
across
the
plateau
and
as
she
felt
the
hours
steal
on
so
fast
so
hideously
fast
with
that
horrible
relentlessness
which
tarries
for
no
despair
as
it
hastens
for
no
desire
her
lips
grew
dry
as
dust
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
the
blood
beat
like
a
thousand
hammers
on
her
brain
what
she
dreaded
came
midway
in
her
course
when
by
the
stars
she
knew
midnight
was
passed
the
animal
strained
with
panting
gasps
to
answer
the
demand
made
on
him
by
the
spur
and
by
the
with
which
he
was
goaded
onward
in
the
lantern
light
she
saw
his
head
stretched
out
in
the
racing
agony
his
distended
eyeballs
his
neck
covered
with
foam
and
blood
his
heaving
flanks
that
seemed
bursting
with
every
throb
that
his
heart
gave
she
knew
that
half
a
league
more
forced
from
him
he
would
drop
like
a
dead
thing
never
to
rise
again
she
let
the
bridle
drop
upon
the
poor
beast
neck
and
threw
her
arms
above
her
head
with
a
shrill
wailing
cry
whose
despair
echoed
over
the
noiseless
plains
like
the
cry
of
a
animal
she
saw
it
all
the
breaking
of
the
rosy
golden
day
the
stillness
of
the
hushed
camp
the
tread
of
the
few
picked
men
the
open
coffin
by
the
open
grave
the
leveled
carbines
gleaming
in
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
she
had
seen
it
so
many
times
seen
it
to
the
awful
end
when
the
living
man
fell
down
in
the
morning
light
a
shattered
senseless
soulless
mass
that
single
moment
was
all
the
soldier
nature
in
her
gave
to
the
abandonment
of
despair
to
the
paralysis
that
seized
her
with
that
one
cry
from
the
depths
of
her
breaking
heart
the
weakness
spent
itself
she
knew
that
action
alone
could
aid
him
she
looked
across
southward
and
northward
east
and
west
to
see
if
there
were
aught
near
from
which
she
could
get
aid
if
there
were
none
the
horse
must
drop
down
to
die
and
with
his
life
the
other
life
would
perish
as
surely
as
the
sun
would
rise
her
gaze
straining
through
the
darkness
broken
here
and
there
by
fitful
gleams
of
moonlight
caught
sight
in
the
distance
of
some
yet
darker
thing
moving
rapidly
a
large
cloud
skimming
the
earth
she
let
the
horse
which
had
paused
the
instant
the
bridle
had
touched
his
neck
stand
still
a
while
and
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
advancing
cloud
till
with
the
marvelous
surety
of
her
vision
she
disentangled
it
from
the
floating
mists
and
wavering
shadows
and
recognized
it
as
it
was
a
band
of
arabs
if
she
turned
eastward
out
of
her
route
the
failing
strength
of
her
horse
would
be
fully
enough
to
take
her
into
safety
from
their
pursuit
or
even
from
their
perception
for
they
were
coming
straightly
and
swiftly
across
the
plain
if
she
were
seen
by
them
she
was
certain
of
her
fate
they
could
only
be
the
desperate
remnant
of
the
decimated
tribes
the
foraging
raiders
of
starving
and
desperate
men
hunted
from
refuge
to
refuge
and
carrying
fire
and
sword
in
their
vengeance
wherever
an
unprotected
caravan
or
a
defenseless
settlement
gave
them
the
power
of
plunder
and
of
slaughter
that
spared
neither
age
nor
sex
she
was
known
throughout
the
length
and
the
breadth
of
the
land
to
the
arabs
she
was
neither
child
nor
woman
to
them
she
was
but
the
soldier
who
had
brought
up
the
french
reserve
at
zaraila
she
was
but
the
foe
who
had
seen
them
defeated
and
ridden
down
with
her
comrades
in
their
pursuit
in
twice
a
score
of
vanquished
bitter
intolerably
shameful
days
some
among
them
had
sworn
by
their
god
to
put
her
to
a
fearful
death
if
ever
they
made
her
captive
for
they
held
her
in
superstitious
awe
and
thought
the
spell
of
the
frankish
successes
would
be
broken
if
she
were
slain
she
knew
that
yet
knowing
it
she
looked
at
their
advancing
band
one
moment
then
turned
her
horse
head
and
rode
straight
toward
them
they
will
kill
me
but
that
may
save
him
she
thought
any
other
way
he
is
so
she
rode
directly
toward
them
rode
so
that
she
crossed
their
front
and
placed
herself
in
their
path
standing
quite
still
with
the
cloth
torn
from
the
lantern
so
that
its
light
fell
full
about
her
as
she
held
it
above
her
head
in
an
instant
they
knew
her
they
were
the
remnant
who
had
escaped
from
the
carnage
of
zaraila
they
knew
her
with
all
the
rapid
unerring
surety
of
hate
they
gave
the
shrill
wild
of
their
tribe
and
the
whole
mass
of
gaunt
dark
mounted
figures
with
their
weapons
whirling
round
their
heads
inclosed
her
a
cloud
of
kites
settled
down
with
their
black
wings
and
cruel
beaks
upon
one
young
falcon
she
sat
unmoved
and
looked
up
at
the
naked
blades
that
flashed
above
her
there
was
no
fear
upon
her
face
only
a
calm
resolute
proud
beauty
very
pale
very
still
in
the
light
that
gleamed
on
it
from
the
lantern
rays
i
surrender
she
said
briefly
she
had
never
thought
to
say
these
words
of
submission
to
her
scorned
foes
she
would
not
have
been
brought
to
utter
them
to
spare
her
own
existence
their
answer
was
a
yell
of
furious
delight
and
their
bare
blades
smote
each
other
with
a
clash
of
brutal
joy
they
had
her
the
frankish
child
who
had
brought
shame
and
destruction
on
them
at
zaraila
and
they
longed
to
draw
their
steel
across
the
fair
young
throat
to
plunge
their
lances
into
the
bright
bare
bosom
to
twine
her
hair
round
their
spear
handles
to
rend
her
delicate
limbs
apart
as
a
tiger
rends
the
antelope
to
torture
to
outrage
to
wreak
their
vengeance
on
her
their
chief
only
motioned
their
violence
back
from
her
and
bade
them
leave
her
untouched
at
him
she
looked
still
with
the
same
fixed
serene
scornful
resolve
she
had
encountered
these
men
so
often
in
battle
she
knew
so
well
how
rich
a
prize
she
was
to
him
but
she
had
one
thought
alone
with
her
and
for
it
she
subdued
contempt
and
hate
and
pride
and
every
passion
in
her
i
surrender
she
said
with
the
same
tranquillity
i
have
heard
that
you
have
sworn
by
your
god
and
your
prophet
to
tear
me
limb
from
limb
because
that
i
a
child
and
a
brought
you
to
shame
and
to
grief
on
the
day
of
zaraila
well
i
am
here
do
it
you
can
slake
your
will
on
me
but
that
you
are
brave
men
and
that
i
have
ever
met
you
in
fair
fight
let
me
speak
one
word
with
you
through
the
menaces
and
the
rage
around
her
fierce
as
the
yelling
of
starving
wolves
around
a
frozen
corpse
her
clear
brave
tones
reached
the
ear
of
the
chief
in
the
lingua
sabir
that
she
used
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
ear
was
caught
by
that
tuneful
voice
his
eyes
by
that
youthful
face
he
signed
upward
the
swords
of
his
followers
and
motioned
them
back
as
their
arms
were
stretched
to
seize
her
and
their
shouts
clamored
for
her
slaughter
speak
on
he
said
briefly
to
her
you
have
sworn
to
take
my
body
sawn
in
two
to
she
pursued
naming
the
arab
leader
whom
her
spahis
had
driven
off
the
field
of
zaraila
well
here
it
is
you
can
take
it
to
him
and
you
will
receive
the
piasters
and
the
horses
and
the
arms
that
he
has
promised
to
whoever
shall
slay
me
i
have
surrendered
i
am
yours
but
you
are
bold
men
and
the
bold
are
never
mean
therefore
i
will
ask
one
thing
of
you
there
is
a
man
yonder
in
my
camp
condemned
to
death
with
the
dawn
he
is
innocent
i
have
ridden
from
algiers
with
the
order
of
his
release
if
it
is
not
there
by
sunrise
he
will
be
shot
and
he
is
guiltless
as
a
child
unborn
my
horse
is
worn
out
he
could
not
go
another
half
league
i
knew
that
since
he
had
failed
my
comrade
would
perish
unless
i
found
a
fresh
beast
or
a
messenger
to
go
in
my
stead
i
saw
your
band
come
across
the
plain
i
knew
that
you
would
kill
me
because
of
your
oath
and
of
your
emir
bride
but
i
thought
that
you
would
have
greatness
enough
in
you
to
save
this
man
who
is
condemned
without
crime
and
who
must
perish
unless
you
his
foes
have
pity
on
him
therefore
i
came
take
the
paper
that
frees
him
send
your
fleetest
and
surest
with
it
under
a
flag
of
truce
into
our
camp
by
the
dawn
let
him
tell
them
there
that
i
cigarette
gave
it
him
he
must
say
no
word
of
what
you
have
done
to
me
or
his
white
flag
will
not
protect
him
from
the
vengeance
of
my
army
and
then
receive
your
reward
from
your
chief
when
you
lay
my
head
down
for
his
horse
hoofs
to
trample
into
the
dust
answer
me
is
the
compact
fair
ride
on
with
this
paper
northward
and
then
kill
me
with
what
torments
you
she
spoke
with
calm
unwavering
resolve
meaning
that
which
she
uttered
to
its
very
uttermost
letter
she
knew
that
these
men
had
thirsted
for
her
blood
she
offered
it
to
be
shed
to
gain
for
him
that
messenger
on
whose
speed
his
life
was
hanging
she
knew
that
a
price
was
set
upon
her
head
but
she
delivered
herself
over
to
the
hands
of
her
enemies
so
that
thereby
she
might
purchase
his
redemption
as
they
heard
silence
fell
upon
the
brutal
clamorous
herd
around
the
silence
of
amaze
and
of
respect
the
young
chief
listened
gravely
by
the
glistening
of
his
keen
black
eyes
he
was
surprised
and
moved
though
true
to
his
teaching
he
showed
neither
emotion
as
he
answered
her
who
is
this
frank
for
whom
you
do
this
thing
he
is
the
warrior
to
whom
you
offered
life
on
the
field
of
zaraila
because
his
courage
was
as
the
courage
of
she
knew
the
qualities
of
the
desert
character
knew
how
to
appeal
to
its
reverence
and
to
its
chivalry
and
for
what
does
he
perish
he
asked
because
he
forgot
for
once
that
he
was
a
slave
and
because
he
has
borne
the
burden
of
guilt
that
was
not
his
they
were
quite
still
now
closed
around
her
these
ferocious
plunderers
who
had
been
thirsty
a
moment
before
to
sheathe
their
weapons
in
her
body
were
spellbound
by
the
sympathy
of
courageous
souls
by
some
vague
perception
that
there
was
a
greatness
in
this
little
tigress
of
france
whom
they
had
sworn
to
hunt
down
and
slaughter
which
surpassed
all
they
had
known
or
dreamed
and
you
have
given
yourself
up
to
us
that
by
your
death
you
may
purchase
a
messenger
from
us
for
this
errand
pursued
their
leader
he
had
been
reared
as
a
boy
in
the
high
tenets
and
the
pure
chivalries
of
the
school
of
and
they
were
not
lost
in
him
despite
the
crimes
and
the
desperation
of
his
life
she
held
the
paper
out
to
him
with
a
passionate
entreaty
breaking
through
the
enforced
calm
of
despair
with
which
she
had
hitherto
spoken
cut
me
in
ten
thousand
pieces
with
your
swords
but
save
him
as
you
are
brave
men
as
you
are
generous
foes
with
a
single
sign
of
his
hand
their
leader
waved
them
back
where
they
crowded
around
her
and
leaped
down
from
his
saddle
and
led
the
horse
he
had
dismounted
to
her
maiden
he
said
gently
we
are
arabs
but
we
are
not
brutes
we
swore
to
avenge
ourselves
on
an
enemy
we
are
not
vile
enough
to
accept
a
martyrdom
take
my
horse
he
is
the
swiftest
of
my
troop
and
go
you
on
your
errand
you
are
safe
from
she
looked
at
him
in
stupor
the
sense
of
his
words
was
not
tangible
to
her
she
had
had
no
hope
no
thought
that
they
would
ever
deal
thus
with
her
all
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
was
so
to
touch
their
hearts
and
their
generosity
that
they
would
spare
one
from
among
their
troop
to
do
the
errand
of
mercy
she
had
begged
of
them
you
play
with
me
she
murmured
while
her
lips
grew
whiter
and
her
great
eyes
larger
in
the
intensity
of
her
emotion
ah
for
pity
sake
make
haste
and
kill
me
so
that
this
only
may
reach
him
the
chief
standing
by
her
lifted
her
up
in
his
sinewy
arms
up
on
to
the
saddle
of
his
charger
his
voice
was
very
solemn
his
glance
was
very
gentle
all
the
nobility
of
the
highest
arab
nature
was
aroused
in
him
at
the
heroism
of
a
child
a
girl
an
infidel
one
in
his
sight
abandoned
and
shameful
among
her
sex
go
in
peace
he
said
simply
it
is
not
with
such
as
thee
that
we
then
and
then
only
as
she
felt
the
fresh
reins
placed
in
her
hand
and
saw
the
ruthless
horde
around
her
fall
back
and
leave
her
free
did
she
understand
his
meaning
did
she
comprehend
that
he
gave
her
back
both
liberty
and
life
and
with
the
surrender
of
the
horse
he
loved
the
noblest
and
most
precious
gift
that
the
arab
ever
bestows
or
ever
receives
the
unutterable
joy
seemed
to
blind
her
and
gleam
upon
her
face
like
the
blazing
light
of
noon
as
she
turned
her
burning
eyes
full
on
him
ah
now
i
believe
that
thine
allah
rules
thee
equally
with
christians
if
i
live
thou
shalt
see
me
back
ere
another
night
if
i
die
france
will
know
how
to
thank
thee
we
do
not
do
the
thing
that
is
right
for
the
sake
that
men
may
recompense
us
he
answered
her
gently
fly
to
thy
friend
and
hereafter
do
not
judge
that
those
who
are
in
arms
against
thee
must
needs
be
as
the
brutes
that
seek
out
whom
they
shall
then
with
one
word
in
his
own
tongue
he
bade
the
horse
bear
her
southward
and
as
swiftly
as
a
spear
launched
from
his
hand
the
animal
obeyed
him
and
flew
across
the
plains
he
looked
after
a
while
through
the
dim
tremulous
darkness
that
seemed
cleft
by
the
rush
of
the
gallop
as
the
clouds
are
cleft
by
lightning
while
his
tribe
sat
silent
on
their
horses
in
moody
unwilling
consent
savage
in
that
they
had
been
deprived
of
prey
moved
in
that
they
were
sensible
of
this
martyrdom
which
had
been
offered
to
them
verily
the
courage
of
a
woman
has
put
the
best
among
us
unto
shame
he
said
rather
to
himself
than
them
as
he
mounted
the
stallion
brought
him
from
the
rear
and
rode
slowly
northward
unconscious
that
the
thing
he
had
done
was
great
because
conscious
only
that
it
was
just
and
borne
by
the
fleetness
of
the
beast
she
went
away
through
the
heavy
dullness
of
the
night
her
brain
had
no
sense
her
hands
had
no
feeling
her
eyes
had
no
sight
the
rushing
of
waters
was
loud
on
her
ears
the
giddiness
of
fasting
and
of
fatigue
sent
the
gloom
eddying
round
and
round
like
a
whirlpool
of
shadow
yet
she
had
remembrance
enough
left
to
ride
on
and
on
and
on
without
once
flinching
from
the
agonies
that
racked
her
cramped
limbs
and
throbbed
in
her
beating
temples
she
had
remembrance
enough
to
strain
her
blind
eyes
toward
the
east
and
murmur
in
her
terror
of
that
white
dawn
that
must
soon
break
the
only
prayer
that
had
been
ever
uttered
by
the
lips
no
mother
kiss
had
ever
touched
o
god
keep
the
day
back
chapter
xxxvii
in
the
midst
of
her
army
there
was
a
line
of
light
in
the
eastern
sky
the
camp
was
very
still
it
was
the
hour
for
the
mounting
of
the
guard
and
as
the
light
spread
higher
and
higher
whiter
and
whiter
as
the
morning
came
a
score
of
men
advanced
slowly
and
in
silence
to
a
broad
strip
of
land
screened
from
the
great
encampment
by
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
ground
and
stretching
far
and
even
with
only
here
and
there
a
single
palm
to
break
its
surface
over
which
the
immense
arc
of
the
sky
bent
gray
and
serene
with
only
the
one
colorless
gleam
eastward
that
was
changing
imperceptibly
into
the
warm
red
flush
of
opening
day
sunrise
and
solitude
they
were
alike
chosen
lest
the
army
that
honored
the
comrades
that
loved
him
should
rise
to
his
rescue
casting
off
the
yoke
of
discipline
and
remembering
only
that
tyranny
and
that
wretchedness
under
which
they
had
seen
him
patient
and
unmoved
throughout
so
many
years
of
servitude
he
stood
tranquil
beside
the
coffin
within
which
his
broken
limbs
and
corpse
would
so
soon
be
laid
forever
there
was
a
deep
sadness
on
his
face
but
it
was
perfectly
serene
to
the
words
of
the
priest
who
approached
him
he
listened
with
respect
though
he
gently
declined
the
services
of
the
church
he
had
spoken
but
very
little
since
his
arrest
he
was
led
out
of
the
camp
in
silence
and
waited
in
silence
now
looking
across
the
plains
to
where
the
dawn
was
growing
richer
and
brighter
with
every
moment
that
the
numbered
seconds
of
his
life
drifted
slowly
and
surely
away
when
they
came
near
to
bind
the
covering
over
his
eyes
he
motioned
them
away
taking
the
bandage
from
their
hands
and
casting
it
far
from
him
did
i
ever
fear
to
look
down
the
depths
of
my
enemies
muskets
it
was
the
single
outbreak
the
single
reproach
that
escaped
from
him
the
single
utterance
by
which
he
ever
quoted
his
services
to
france
not
one
who
heard
him
dared
again
force
on
him
that
indignity
which
would
have
blinded
his
sight
as
though
he
had
ever
dreaded
to
meet
death
that
one
protest
having
escaped
from
him
he
was
once
more
still
and
calm
as
though
the
vacant
grave
yawning
at
his
feet
had
been
but
a
couch
of
down
to
rest
his
tired
limbs
his
eyes
watched
the
daylight
deepen
and
widen
and
grow
into
one
sheet
of
glowing
roseate
warmth
but
there
was
no
regret
in
the
gaze
there
was
a
fixed
fathomless
resignation
that
moved
with
a
vague
sense
of
awe
those
who
had
come
to
slay
him
and
who
had
been
so
used
to
slaughter
that
they
fired
their
volley
into
their
comrade
breast
as
callously
as
into
the
ranks
of
their
antagonists
it
is
best
thus
he
thought
if
only
she
never
knows
over
the
slope
of
brown
and
barren
earth
that
screened
the
camp
from
view
there
came
at
the
very
moment
that
the
ramrods
were
drawn
out
with
a
shrill
sharp
ring
from
the
a
single
figure
tall
stalwart
lithe
with
the
spring
of
the
deerstalker
in
its
rapid
step
and
the
sinew
of
the
northern
races
in
its
mold
cecil
never
saw
it
he
was
looking
at
the
east
at
the
deepening
of
the
morning
flush
that
was
the
signal
of
his
slaughter
and
his
head
was
turned
away
the
newcomer
went
straight
to
the
adjutant
in
command
and
addressed
him
with
brief
preface
hurriedly
and
low
your
prisoner
is
victor
of
the
chasseurs
he
is
to
be
shot
this
morning
the
officer
assented
he
suffered
the
interruption
recognizing
the
rank
of
the
speaker
i
heard
of
it
yesterday
i
rode
all
night
from
oran
i
feel
great
pity
for
this
man
though
he
is
unknown
to
me
the
stranger
pursued
in
rapid
whispered
words
his
crime
was
a
blow
to
his
colonel
and
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
reprieve
may
i
speak
with
him
an
instant
i
have
heard
it
said
that
he
is
of
my
country
and
of
a
rank
above
his
standing
in
his
regiment
you
may
address
him
le
duc
but
be
brief
time
he
thanked
the
officer
for
the
unusual
permission
and
turned
to
approach
the
prisoner
at
that
moment
cecil
turned
also
and
their
eyes
met
a
great
shuddering
cry
broke
from
them
both
his
head
sank
as
though
the
bullet
had
already
pierced
his
breast
and
the
man
who
believed
him
dead
stood
gazing
at
him
paralyzed
with
horror
for
a
moment
there
was
an
awful
silence
then
the
seraph
voice
rang
out
with
a
terror
in
it
that
thrilled
through
the
careless
callous
hearts
of
the
watching
soldiery
who
is
that
man
he
died
he
died
so
long
ago
and
yet
cecil
head
was
sunk
on
his
chest
he
never
spoke
he
never
moved
he
knew
the
helpless
hopeless
misery
that
waited
for
the
one
who
found
him
living
only
to
find
him
also
standing
before
his
open
grave
he
saw
nothing
he
only
felt
the
crushing
force
of
his
friend
arms
flung
round
him
as
though
seizing
him
to
learn
whether
he
were
a
living
man
or
a
spector
dreamed
of
in
delirium
who
are
you
answer
me
for
pity
sake
as
the
swift
hoarse
incredulous
words
poured
on
his
ear
he
not
seeking
to
unloose
the
other
hold
lifted
his
head
and
looked
full
in
the
eyes
that
had
not
met
his
own
for
twelve
long
years
in
that
one
look
all
was
uttered
the
strained
eager
doubting
eyes
that
read
their
answer
in
it
needed
no
other
you
live
still
oh
thank
god
thank
god
and
as
the
thanksgiving
escaped
him
he
forgot
all
save
the
breathless
joy
of
this
resurrection
forgot
that
at
their
feet
the
yawning
grave
was
open
and
unfilled
then
and
only
then
under
that
recognition
of
the
friendship
that
had
never
failed
and
never
doubted
the
courage
of
the
condemned
gave
way
and
his
limbs
shook
with
a
great
shiver
of
intolerable
torture
and
at
the
look
that
came
upon
his
face
the
look
of
death
anguish
the
man
who
loved
him
remembered
all
remembered
that
he
stood
there
in
the
morning
light
only
to
be
shot
down
like
a
beast
of
prey
holding
him
there
still
with
that
strong
pressure
of
his
sinewy
hands
he
swore
a
great
oath
that
rolled
like
thunder
down
the
hard
keen
air
you
perishing
here
if
they
send
their
shots
through
you
they
shall
reach
me
first
in
their
passage
o
heaven
why
have
you
lived
like
this
why
have
you
been
lost
to
me
if
you
were
dead
to
all
the
world
beside
they
were
the
words
that
his
sister
had
spoken
cecil
white
lips
quivered
as
he
heard
them
his
voice
was
scarcely
audible
as
it
panted
through
them
i
was
accused
aye
but
by
whom
not
by
me
never
by
me
cecil
eyes
filled
with
slow
blinding
tears
tears
sweet
as
a
in
her
joy
bitter
as
a
man
in
his
agony
he
knew
that
in
this
one
heart
at
least
no
base
suspicion
ever
had
harbored
he
knew
that
this
love
at
least
had
cleaved
to
him
through
all
shame
and
against
all
evil
god
reward
you
he
murmured
you
have
never
doubted
doubted
was
your
honor
not
as
my
own
i
can
die
at
peace
then
you
know
me
guiltless
great
god
death
shall
not
touch
you
as
i
stand
here
not
a
hair
of
your
head
shall
be
harmed
hush
justice
must
take
its
course
one
thing
only
has
she
heard
nothing
she
has
left
africa
but
you
can
be
saved
you
shall
be
saved
they
do
not
know
what
they
do
yes
they
but
follow
the
sentence
of
the
law
do
not
regret
it
it
is
best
best
that
you
should
be
slaughtered
in
cold
blood
his
voice
was
hoarse
with
the
horror
which
despite
his
words
possessed
him
he
knew
what
the
demands
of
discipline
exacted
he
knew
what
the
inexorable
tyranny
of
the
army
enforced
he
knew
that
he
had
found
the
life
lost
to
him
for
so
long
only
to
stand
by
and
see
it
struck
down
like
a
shot
stag
cecil
eyes
looked
at
him
with
a
regard
in
which
all
the
sacrifice
all
the
patience
all
the
martyrdom
of
his
life
spoke
best
because
a
lie
i
could
never
speak
to
you
and
the
truth
i
can
never
tell
to
you
do
not
let
her
know
it
might
give
her
pain
i
have
loved
her
that
is
useless
like
all
the
rest
give
me
your
hand
once
more
and
then
let
them
do
their
duty
turn
your
head
away
it
will
soon
be
over
almost
ere
he
asked
it
his
friend
hands
closed
upon
both
is
own
keeping
the
promise
made
so
long
before
in
the
old
years
gone
great
tearless
sobs
heaved
the
depths
of
his
broad
chest
those
gentle
weary
words
had
rent
his
very
soul
and
he
knew
that
he
was
powerless
here
he
knew
that
he
could
no
more
stay
this
doom
of
death
than
he
could
stay
the
rising
of
the
sun
up
over
the
eastern
heavens
the
clear
voice
of
the
officer
in
command
rang
shrilly
through
the
stillness
monsieur
make
your
farewell
i
can
wait
no
the
seraph
started
and
flung
himself
round
with
the
grand
challenge
of
a
lion
struck
by
a
puny
spear
his
face
flushed
crimson
his
words
were
choked
in
his
throbbing
throat
as
i
live
you
shall
not
fire
i
forbid
you
i
swear
by
my
honor
and
the
honor
of
england
that
he
shall
not
die
like
a
dog
he
is
of
my
country
he
is
of
my
order
i
will
appeal
to
your
emperor
he
will
accord
me
his
life
the
instant
i
ask
it
give
me
only
an
reprieve
a
few
moments
space
to
speak
to
your
chiefs
to
seek
out
your
general
it
is
impossible
the
curt
calm
answer
was
inflexible
against
the
sentence
and
its
execution
there
could
be
no
appeal
cecil
laid
his
hand
upon
his
old
friend
shoulders
it
will
be
useless
he
murmured
let
them
act
the
quicker
the
what
you
think
i
would
look
on
and
see
you
die
would
to
heaven
you
had
never
known
i
lived
the
officer
made
a
gesture
to
the
guard
to
separate
them
monsieur
submit
to
the
execution
of
the
law
or
i
must
arrest
lyonnesse
flung
off
the
detaining
hand
of
the
guard
and
swung
round
so
that
his
agonized
eyes
gazed
close
into
the
adjutant
immovable
face
which
before
that
gaze
lost
its
coldness
and
its
rigor
and
changed
to
a
great
pity
for
this
stranger
who
had
found
the
friend
of
his
youth
in
the
man
who
stood
condemned
to
perish
there
an
hour
reprieve
for
mercy
sake
grant
that
i
have
said
it
is
but
you
do
not
dream
who
is
it
matters
he
is
an
english
noble
i
tell
you
he
is
a
soldier
who
has
broken
the
law
that
o
heaven
have
you
no
humanity
we
have
justice
if
you
have
justice
let
your
chiefs
hear
his
story
let
his
name
be
made
known
give
me
an
hour
space
to
plead
for
him
your
emperor
would
grant
me
his
life
were
he
here
yield
me
an
hour
a
half
hour
anything
that
will
give
me
time
to
serve
him
it
is
out
of
the
question
i
must
obey
my
orders
i
regret
you
should
have
this
pain
but
if
you
do
not
cease
to
interfere
my
soldiers
must
make
where
the
guards
held
him
cecil
saw
and
heard
his
voice
rose
with
all
its
old
strength
and
sweetness
my
friend
do
not
plead
for
me
for
the
sake
of
our
common
country
and
our
old
love
let
us
both
meet
this
with
silence
and
with
you
are
a
madman
cried
the
man
whose
heart
felt
breaking
under
this
doom
he
could
neither
avert
nor
share
you
think
that
they
shall
kill
you
before
my
eyes
you
think
i
shall
stand
by
to
see
you
murdered
what
crime
have
you
done
none
i
dare
swear
save
being
moved
under
insult
to
act
as
the
men
of
your
race
ever
acted
ah
god
why
have
lived
as
you
have
done
why
not
have
trusted
my
faith
and
my
love
if
you
had
believed
in
my
faith
as
i
believed
in
your
innocence
this
misery
never
had
come
to
us
hush
hush
or
you
will
make
me
die
like
a
he
dreaded
lest
he
should
do
so
this
ordeal
was
greater
than
his
power
to
bear
it
with
the
mere
sound
of
this
man
voice
a
longing
so
intense
in
its
despairing
desire
came
on
him
for
this
life
which
they
were
about
to
kill
in
him
forever
the
words
stung
his
hearer
to
madness
he
turned
on
the
soldiers
with
all
the
fury
of
his
race
that
slumbered
so
long
but
when
it
awoke
was
like
the
lion
rage
invective
entreaty
conjuration
command
imploring
prayer
and
ungoverned
passion
poured
in
tumultuous
words
in
agonized
eloquence
from
his
lips
all
answer
was
a
quick
sign
of
the
hand
and
ere
he
saw
them
a
dozen
soldiers
were
round
him
his
arms
were
seized
his
splendid
frame
was
held
as
powerless
as
a
lassoed
bull
for
a
moment
there
was
a
horrible
struggle
then
a
score
of
ruthless
hands
locked
him
as
in
iron
gyves
and
forced
his
mouth
to
silence
and
his
eyes
to
blindness
this
was
all
the
mercy
they
could
give
to
spare
him
the
sight
of
his
friend
slaughter
cecil
eyes
strained
in
him
with
one
last
longing
look
then
he
raised
his
hand
and
gave
the
signal
for
his
own
the
leveled
carbines
covered
him
he
stood
erect
with
his
face
full
toward
the
sun
ere
they
could
fire
a
shrill
cry
pierced
the
air
wait
in
the
name
of
dismounted
breathless
staggering
with
her
arms
flung
upward
and
her
face
bloodless
with
fear
cigarette
appeared
upon
the
ridge
of
rising
ground
the
cry
of
command
pealed
out
upon
the
silence
in
the
voice
that
the
army
of
africa
loved
as
the
voice
of
their
little
one
and
the
cry
came
too
late
the
volley
was
fired
the
crash
of
sound
thrilled
across
the
words
that
bade
them
pause
the
heavy
smoke
rolled
out
upon
the
air
the
death
that
was
doomed
was
dealt
but
beyond
the
he
staggered
slightly
and
then
stood
erect
still
almost
unharmed
grazed
only
by
some
few
of
the
balls
the
flash
of
fire
was
not
so
fleet
as
the
swiftness
of
her
love
and
on
his
breast
she
threw
herself
and
flung
her
arms
about
him
and
turned
her
head
backward
with
her
old
dauntless
sunlit
smile
as
the
balls
pierced
her
bosom
and
broke
her
limbs
and
were
turned
away
by
the
shield
of
warm
young
life
from
him
her
arms
were
gliding
from
about
his
neck
and
her
shot
limbs
were
sinking
to
the
earth
as
he
caught
her
up
where
she
dropped
to
his
feet
o
god
my
child
they
have
killed
you
he
suffered
more
as
the
cry
broke
from
him
than
if
the
bullets
had
brought
him
that
death
which
he
saw
at
one
glance
had
stricken
down
forever
all
the
glory
of
her
childhood
all
the
gladness
of
her
youth
she
laughed
all
the
clear
imperious
arch
laughter
of
her
sunniest
hours
unchanged
chut
it
is
the
powder
and
ball
of
france
that
does
not
hurt
if
it
was
an
arbico
bullet
now
but
wait
here
is
the
marshal
order
he
suspends
your
sentence
i
have
told
him
all
you
are
safe
do
you
hear
you
are
safe
how
he
looks
is
he
grieved
to
live
mes
francais
tell
him
clearer
than
i
can
tell
here
is
the
order
the
general
must
have
it
no
not
out
of
my
hand
till
the
general
sees
it
fetch
him
some
of
you
fetch
him
to
great
heavens
you
have
given
your
life
for
mine
the
words
broke
from
him
in
an
agony
as
he
held
her
upward
against
his
heart
himself
so
blind
so
stunned
with
the
sudden
recall
from
death
to
life
and
with
the
sacrifice
whereby
life
was
thus
brought
to
him
that
he
could
scarce
see
her
face
scarce
hear
her
voice
but
only
dimly
incredulously
terribly
knew
in
some
vague
sense
that
she
was
dying
and
dying
thus
for
him
she
smiled
up
in
his
eyes
while
even
in
that
moment
when
her
life
was
broken
down
like
a
wounded
bird
and
the
shots
had
pierced
through
from
her
shoulder
to
her
bosom
a
hot
scarlet
flush
came
over
her
cheeks
as
she
felt
his
touch
and
rested
on
his
heart
a
life
what
is
it
to
give
we
hold
it
in
our
hands
every
hour
we
soldiers
and
toss
it
in
change
for
a
draught
of
wine
lay
me
down
on
the
ground
at
your
feet
so
i
shall
live
longest
that
way
and
i
have
much
to
tell
how
they
crowd
around
me
mes
soldats
do
not
make
that
grief
and
that
rage
over
me
they
are
sorry
they
fired
that
is
foolish
they
were
only
doing
their
duty
and
they
could
not
hear
me
in
but
the
brave
words
could
not
console
those
who
had
killed
the
child
of
the
tricolor
they
flung
their
carbines
away
they
beat
their
breasts
they
cursed
themselves
and
the
mother
who
had
borne
them
the
silent
rigid
motionless
phalanx
that
had
stood
there
in
the
dawn
to
see
death
dealt
in
the
inexorable
penalty
of
the
law
was
broken
up
into
a
tumultuous
breathless
infuriated
throng
maddened
with
remorse
convulsed
with
sorrow
turning
wild
eyes
of
hate
on
him
as
on
the
cause
through
which
their
darling
had
been
stricken
he
laying
her
down
with
unspeakable
gentleness
as
she
had
bidden
him
hung
over
her
leaning
her
head
against
his
arm
and
watching
in
paralyzed
horror
the
helplessness
of
the
quivering
limbs
the
slow
flowing
of
the
blood
beneath
the
cross
that
shone
where
that
young
heroic
heart
so
soon
would
beat
no
more
oh
my
child
my
child
he
moaned
as
the
full
might
and
meaning
of
this
devotion
which
had
saved
him
at
such
cost
rushed
on
him
what
am
i
worth
that
you
should
perish
for
me
better
a
thousand
times
have
left
me
to
my
fate
such
nobility
such
sacrifice
such
love
the
hot
color
flushed
her
face
once
more
she
was
strong
to
the
last
to
conceal
that
passion
for
which
she
was
still
content
to
perish
in
her
youth
chut
we
are
comrades
and
you
are
a
brave
man
i
would
do
the
same
for
any
of
my
spahis
look
you
i
never
heard
of
your
arrest
till
i
heard
too
of
your
sentence
she
paused
a
moment
and
her
features
grew
white
and
quivered
with
pain
and
with
the
oppression
that
seemed
to
lie
like
lead
upon
her
chest
but
she
forced
herself
to
be
stronger
than
the
anguish
which
assailed
her
strength
and
she
motioned
them
all
to
be
silent
as
she
spoke
on
while
her
voice
still
should
serve
her
they
will
tell
you
how
i
did
it
i
have
not
time
the
marshal
gave
his
word
you
shall
be
saved
there
is
no
fear
that
is
your
friend
who
bends
over
me
here
is
it
not
a
fair
face
a
brave
face
you
will
go
back
to
your
land
you
will
live
among
your
own
people
and
she
she
will
love
you
now
now
she
knows
you
are
of
her
order
something
of
the
old
thrill
of
jealous
dread
and
hate
quivered
through
the
words
but
the
purer
nobler
nature
vanquished
it
she
smiled
up
in
his
eyes
heedless
of
the
tumult
round
them
you
will
be
happy
that
is
well
look
you
it
is
nothing
that
i
did
i
would
have
done
it
for
any
one
of
my
soldiers
and
for
this
she
touched
the
blood
flowing
from
her
side
with
the
old
bright
brave
smile
it
was
an
accident
they
must
not
grieve
for
it
my
men
are
good
to
me
they
will
feel
much
regret
and
remorse
but
do
not
let
them
i
am
glad
to
the
words
were
unwavering
and
heroic
but
for
one
moment
a
convulsion
went
over
her
face
the
young
life
was
so
strong
in
her
the
young
spirit
was
so
joyous
in
her
existence
was
so
new
so
fresh
so
bright
so
dauntless
a
thing
to
cigarette
she
loved
life
the
darkness
the
loneliness
the
annihilation
of
death
were
horrible
to
her
as
the
blackness
and
the
solitude
of
night
to
a
young
child
death
like
night
can
be
welcome
only
to
the
weary
and
she
was
weary
of
nothing
on
the
earth
that
bore
her
buoyant
steps
the
suns
the
winds
the
delights
of
the
sights
the
joys
of
the
senses
the
music
of
her
own
laughter
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
air
upon
her
cheeks
or
of
the
blue
sky
above
her
head
were
all
so
sweet
to
her
her
welcome
of
her
was
the
only
untruth
that
had
ever
soiled
her
fearless
lips
death
was
terrible
yet
she
was
content
content
to
have
come
to
it
for
his
sake
there
was
a
ghastly
stricken
silence
round
her
the
order
she
had
brought
had
just
been
glanced
at
but
no
other
thought
was
with
the
most
callous
there
than
the
heroism
of
her
act
than
the
martyrdom
of
her
death
the
color
was
fast
passing
from
her
lips
and
a
mortal
pallor
settling
there
in
the
stead
of
that
rich
bright
hue
once
warm
as
the
scarlet
heart
of
the
pomegranate
her
head
leaned
back
on
cecil
breast
and
she
felt
the
great
burning
tears
fall
one
by
one
upon
her
brow
as
he
hung
speechless
over
her
she
put
her
hand
upward
and
touched
his
eyes
softly
chut
what
is
it
to
die
just
to
die
you
have
lived
your
martyrdom
i
could
not
have
done
that
listen
just
one
moment
you
will
be
rich
take
care
of
the
old
man
he
will
not
trouble
long
and
of
and
etoile
and
boule
blanche
and
the
rat
and
all
the
dogs
will
you
they
will
show
you
the
chateau
de
cigarette
in
algiers
i
should
not
like
to
think
that
they
would
she
felt
his
lips
move
with
the
promise
he
could
not
find
voice
to
utter
and
she
thanked
him
with
that
old
smile
that
had
lost
nothing
of
its
light
that
is
good
they
will
be
happy
with
you
and
see
here
that
arab
must
have
back
his
white
horse
he
alone
saved
you
have
heed
that
they
spare
him
and
make
my
grave
somewhere
where
my
army
passes
where
i
can
hear
the
trumpets
and
the
arms
and
the
passage
of
the
troops
o
god
i
forgot
i
shall
not
wake
when
the
bugles
sound
it
will
all
end
now
will
it
not
that
is
horrible
horrible
a
shudder
shook
her
as
for
the
moment
the
full
sense
that
all
her
glowing
redundant
sunlit
passionate
life
was
crushed
out
forever
from
its
place
upon
the
earth
forced
itself
on
and
overwhelmed
her
but
she
was
of
too
brave
a
mold
to
suffer
any
foe
even
the
foe
that
conquers
kings
to
have
power
to
appall
her
she
raised
herself
and
looked
at
the
soldiery
around
her
among
them
the
men
whose
carbines
had
killed
her
whose
anguish
was
like
the
anguish
of
women
mes
francais
that
was
a
foolish
word
of
mine
how
many
of
my
bravest
have
fallen
in
death
and
shall
i
be
afraid
of
what
they
welcomed
do
not
grieve
like
that
you
could
not
help
it
you
were
doing
your
duty
if
the
shots
had
not
come
to
me
they
would
have
gone
to
him
and
he
has
been
unhappy
so
long
and
borne
wrong
so
patiently
he
has
earned
the
right
to
live
and
enjoy
now
i
i
have
been
happy
all
my
days
like
a
bird
like
a
kitten
like
a
foal
just
from
being
young
and
taking
no
thought
i
should
have
had
to
suffer
if
i
had
lived
it
is
much
best
as
it
is
her
voice
failed
her
when
she
had
spoken
the
heroic
words
loss
of
blood
was
fast
draining
all
strength
from
her
and
she
quivered
in
a
torture
she
could
not
wholly
conceal
he
for
whom
she
perished
hung
over
her
in
an
agony
greater
far
than
hers
it
seemed
a
hideous
dream
to
him
that
this
child
lay
dying
in
his
stead
can
nothing
save
her
he
cried
aloud
o
god
that
you
had
fired
one
moment
sooner
she
heard
and
looked
up
at
him
with
a
look
in
which
all
the
passionate
hopeless
imperishable
love
she
had
resisted
and
concealed
so
long
spoke
with
an
intensity
she
never
dreamed
she
is
content
she
whispered
softly
you
did
not
understand
her
rightly
that
was
all
o
god
how
i
have
wronged
you
the
full
strength
and
nobility
and
devotion
of
this
passion
he
had
disbelieved
in
and
neglected
rushed
on
him
as
he
met
her
eyes
for
the
first
time
he
saw
her
as
she
was
for
the
first
time
he
saw
all
of
which
the
splendid
heroism
of
this
untrained
nature
would
have
been
capable
under
a
different
fate
and
it
struck
him
suddenly
heavily
as
with
a
blow
it
filled
him
with
a
passion
of
remorse
my
darling
my
darling
what
have
i
done
to
be
worthy
of
such
love
he
murmured
while
the
tears
fell
from
his
blinded
eyes
and
his
head
drooped
until
his
lips
met
hers
at
the
first
utterance
of
that
word
between
them
at
the
unconscious
tenderness
of
his
kisses
that
had
the
anguish
of
a
farewell
in
them
the
color
suddenly
flushed
all
over
her
blanched
face
she
trembled
in
his
arms
and
a
great
shivering
sigh
ran
through
her
it
came
too
late
this
warmth
of
love
she
learned
what
its
sweetness
might
have
been
only
when
her
lips
grew
numb
and
her
eyes
sightless
and
her
heart
without
pulse
and
her
senses
without
consciousness
hush
she
answered
with
a
look
that
pierced
his
soul
keep
those
kisses
for
milady
she
will
have
the
right
to
love
you
she
is
of
your
she
is
not
as
for
me
i
am
only
a
little
trooper
who
has
saved
my
comrade
my
soldiers
come
round
me
one
instant
i
shall
not
long
find
her
eyes
closed
as
she
spoke
a
deadly
faintness
and
coldness
passed
over
her
and
she
gasped
for
breath
a
moment
and
the
resolute
courage
in
her
conquered
her
eyes
opened
and
rested
on
the
faces
of
her
children
rested
in
a
long
last
look
of
unspeakable
wistfulness
and
tenderness
i
can
not
speak
as
i
would
she
said
at
length
while
her
voice
grew
very
faint
but
i
have
loved
you
all
is
said
all
was
uttered
in
those
four
brief
words
she
had
loved
the
whole
story
of
her
young
life
was
told
in
the
single
phrase
and
the
gaunt
murderous
ruthless
veterans
of
africa
who
heard
her
could
have
turned
their
weapons
against
their
own
breasts
and
sheathed
them
there
rather
than
have
looked
on
to
see
their
darling
die
i
have
been
too
quick
in
anger
sometimes
forgive
it
she
said
gently
and
do
not
fight
and
curse
among
yourselves
it
is
bad
amid
brethren
bury
my
cross
with
me
if
they
will
let
you
and
let
the
colors
be
over
my
grave
if
you
can
think
of
me
when
you
go
into
battle
and
tell
them
in
france
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
filled
with
great
tears
as
the
name
of
her
beloved
land
paused
upon
her
lips
she
stretched
her
arms
out
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
longing
like
a
lost
child
that
vainly
seeks
its
mother
if
i
could
only
see
france
once
more
france
it
was
the
last
word
upon
her
utterance
her
eyes
met
cecil
in
one
fleeting
upward
glance
of
unutterable
tenderness
then
with
her
hands
still
stretched
out
westward
to
where
her
country
was
and
with
the
dauntless
heroism
of
her
smile
upon
her
face
like
light
she
gave
a
tired
sigh
as
of
a
child
that
sinks
to
sleep
and
in
the
midst
of
her
army
of
africa
the
little
one
lay
dead
in
the
shadow
of
his
tent
at
midnight
he
whom
she
had
rescued
stood
looking
down
at
a
bowed
stricken
form
before
him
with
an
exceeding
yearning
pity
in
his
gaze
the
words
had
at
length
been
spoken
that
had
lifted
from
him
the
burden
of
another
guilt
the
hour
at
last
had
come
in
which
his
eyes
had
met
the
eyes
of
his
friend
without
a
hidden
thought
between
them
the
sacrifice
was
ended
the
martyrdom
was
over
henceforth
this
doom
of
exile
and
of
wretchedness
would
be
but
as
a
hideous
dream
henceforth
his
name
would
be
stainless
among
men
and
the
desire
of
his
heart
would
be
given
him
and
in
this
hour
of
release
the
strongest
feeling
in
him
was
the
sadness
of
an
infinite
compassion
and
where
his
brother
was
stretched
prostrate
in
shame
before
him
cecil
stooped
and
raised
him
tenderly
say
no
more
he
murmured
it
has
been
well
for
me
that
i
have
suffered
these
things
for
yourself
if
you
do
indeed
repent
and
feel
that
you
owe
me
any
debt
atone
for
it
and
pay
it
by
letting
your
own
life
be
strong
in
truth
and
fair
in
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
himself
had
done
no
great
or
righteous
thing
in
that
servitude
for
another
sake
whose
yoke
was
now
lifted
off
him
for
evermore
but
looking
out
over
the
sleeping
camp
where
one
young
child
alone
lay
in
a
slumber
that
never
would
be
broken
his
heart
ached
with
the
sense
of
some
great
priceless
gift
received
and
undeserved
and
cast
aside
even
while
in
the
dreams
of
passion
that
now
knew
its
fruition
possible
and
the
sweetness
of
communion
with
the
friend
whose
faith
had
never
forsaken
him
he
retraced
the
years
of
his
exile
and
thanked
god
that
it
was
thus
with
him
at
the
end
chapter
the
last
at
rest
under
the
green
springtide
leafage
of
english
woodlands
made
musical
with
the
movement
and
the
song
of
innumerable
birds
that
had
their
nests
among
the
hawthorn
boughs
and
deep
cool
foliage
of
elm
and
beech
an
old
horse
stood
at
pasture
sleeping
with
the
sun
on
his
gray
silken
skin
and
the
flies
driven
off
with
a
dreamy
switch
of
his
tail
and
the
grasses
odorous
about
his
hoofs
with
and
cowslips
and
wild
thyme
sleeping
yet
not
so
surely
but
at
one
voice
he
started
and
raised
his
head
with
all
the
eager
grace
of
his
youth
and
gave
a
murmuring
noise
of
welcome
and
delight
he
had
known
that
voice
in
an
instant
though
for
so
many
years
his
ear
had
never
thrilled
to
it
forest
king
had
never
forgotten
now
scarce
a
day
passed
but
what
it
spoke
to
him
some
word
of
greeting
or
of
affection
and
his
black
soft
eyes
would
gleam
with
their
old
fire
because
its
tone
brought
back
a
thousand
memories
of
bygone
victory
only
memories
now
when
forest
king
in
the
years
of
age
dreamed
out
his
happy
life
under
the
fragrant
shade
of
the
forest
wealth
of
royallieu
with
his
arm
over
the
horse
neck
the
exile
who
had
returned
to
his
birthright
stood
silent
a
while
gazing
out
over
the
land
on
which
his
eyes
never
wearied
of
resting
the
glad
cool
green
earth
that
was
so
sweet
and
full
of
peace
after
the
scorched
and
plains
whose
sun
was
as
flame
and
whose
breath
was
as
pestilence
then
his
glance
came
back
and
dwelt
upon
the
face
beside
him
the
proud
and
splendid
woman
face
that
had
learned
its
softness
and
its
passion
from
him
alone
it
was
worth
banishment
to
return
he
murmured
to
her
it
was
worth
the
trials
that
i
bore
to
learn
the
love
that
i
have
known
she
looking
upward
at
him
with
those
deep
lustrous
imperial
eyes
that
had
first
met
his
own
in
the
glare
of
the
african
noon
passed
her
hand
over
his
lips
with
a
gesture
of
tenderness
far
more
eloquent
from
her
than
from
women
less
proud
and
less
prone
to
weakness
ah
hush
when
i
think
of
what
her
love
was
how
worthless
looks
my
own
how
little
worthy
of
the
fate
it
finds
what
have
i
done
that
every
joy
should
become
mine
when
she
her
mouth
trembled
and
the
phrase
died
unfinished
strong
as
her
love
had
grown
it
looked
to
her
unproven
and
without
desert
beside
that
which
had
chose
to
perish
for
his
sake
and
where
they
stood
with
the
future
as
fair
before
them
as
the
light
of
the
day
around
them
he
bowed
his
head
as
before
some
sacred
thing
at
the
whisper
of
the
child
who
had
died
for
him
the
memories
of
both
went
back
to
a
place
in
a
desert
land
where
the
folds
of
the
tricolor
drooped
over
one
little
grave
turned
westward
toward
the
shores
of
france
a
grave
made
where
the
beat
of
drum
and
the
sound
of
moving
squadrons
and
the
ring
of
the
and
the
noise
of
the
assembling
battalions
could
be
heard
by
night
and
day
a
grave
where
the
troops
as
they
passed
it
by
saluted
and
lowered
their
arms
in
tender
reverence
in
faithful
unasked
homage
because
beneath
the
flag
they
honored
there
was
carved
in
the
white
stone
one
name
that
spoke
to
every
heart
within
the
army
she
had
loved
one
name
on
which
the
arab
sun
streamed
as
with
a
martyr
glory
