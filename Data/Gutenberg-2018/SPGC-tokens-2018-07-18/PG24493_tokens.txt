how

there
is
one
thing
that
all
the
birds
are
afraid
of
and
that
is
the
thing
that
will
happen
when
the
bird
that
follows
the
cuckoo
flies
into
the
cuckoo
mouth
and
what
will
happen
then
asks
my
kind
when
the
bird
that
follows
the
cuckoo
flies
into
the
cuckoo
mouth
the
world
will
come
to
an
end
all
the
birds
know
that
but
not
all
the
people
know
it
well
one
day
the
cuckoo
was
sitting
on
a
bush
and
her
mouth
was
open
the
bird
that
follows
the
cuckoo
flew
straight
at
it
and
into
it
he
must
have
flown
only
for
the
boy
the
boy
was
in
the
tree
and
he
flung
his
cap
at
the
cuckoo
and
he
covered
the
cuckoo
and
the
cuckoo
open
mouth
the
bird
that
follows
the
cuckoo
flew
into
the
crow
mouth
instead
and
the
crow
gave
that
bird
a
squeeze
i
can
tell
you
the
cuckoo
pushed
off
the
boy
cap
with
her
wings
and
flew
into
the
forest
all
the
birds
of
the
king
garden
were
there
at
the
time
there
were
the
crow
the
woodpecker
the
wren
and
the
eagle
the
blackbird
and

the
jackdaw
and
starling
and
the

awful
and
the
cock
with
his
hens
and

and
linnet
and
brisk
little
sparrow
the
too
and
my
own
little
goldfinch
all
the
birds
in
the
king
garden
were
overjoyed
that
the
bird
that
follows
the
cuckoo
did
not
get
into
the
cuckoo
mouth
what
shall
we
do
for
the
boy
who
prevented
the
world
from
coming
to
an
end
asked
the
corncrake
she
was
there
too
but
i
forgot
to
mention
her
nothing
said
the
the
boy
who
would
throw
a
cap
would
throw
a
stone
do
nothing
at
all
for
him
i
sing
for
him
said
the
goldfinch
i
teach
him
what
the
birds
say
said
the
crow
if
he
knew
the
language
of
the
birds
he
would
be
like
king
solomon
said
the
raven
let
us
make
him
like
king
solomon
said
the
goldfinch
yes
yes
yes
said
all
the
birds
in
the
king
garden
the
boy
had
not
gone
far
when
the
crow
flew
after
him
and
lighted
on
his
shoulder
the
crow
spoke
to
him
in
the
boy
own
language
the
boy
was
surprised
the
crow
flew
to
a
standing
stone
and
went
on
speaking
plain
words
to
him
o
said
the
boy
i
did
know
you
could
speak
why
should
i
know
how
to
speak
said
the
crow
have
i
for
a
hundred
years
and
more
been
watching
men
and
listening
to
their
words
why
should
i
be
able
to
speak
and
you
can
speak
well
said
the
boy
not
forgetting
his
manners
you
know
one
language
but
i
know
many
languages
said
the
crow
for
i
know
what
people
say
and
i
know
what
all
the
birds
say
the
old
crow
sat
there
looking
so
wise
and
so
friendly
that
the
boy
began
to
talk
to
her
at
his
ease
and
after
a
while
the
boy
said
do
you
think
i
could
ever
learn
what
the
birds
say
you
would
if
you
had
me
to
teach
you
said
the
crow
and
will
you
teach
me
said
the
boy
i
will
said
the
crow
then
every
day
after
that
the
crow
would
sit
upon
the
standing
stone
and
the
boy
would
stand
beside
it
when
the
crow
had
eaten
the
boiled
potato
that
the
boy
always
brought
she
would
tell
him
about
the
languages
of
the
different
birds
the
two
were
teaching
and
learning
from
day
to
day
and
indeed
you
might
say
that
the
boy
went
to
school
to
the
crow
he
learnt
the
language
of
this
bird
and
that
bird
and
as
he
learnt
their
languages

word
of
it
and
by
the
tongue
in
my
mouth
here
is
the
story
he
heard
cloo
cloo
cloo
the
king
of
ireland
stood
outside
the
gate
of
his
castle
and
his
powerful
captains
and
his
guards
were
all
around
him
and
one
of
his
captains
went
to
the
mound
before
him
and
he
gave
a
shout
to
the
east
and
a
shout
to
the
west
and
a
shout
to
the
north
and
a
shout
to
the
south
when
the
king
asked
him
why
he
did
it
the
captain
said
i
want
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
to
know
that
the
king
of
ireland
stands
here
with
his
powerful
captains
and
his
strong
armed
guards
that
no
one
dare
come
from
the
east
or
west
the
north
or
the
south
and
lay
the
weight
of
a
finger
upon
him
and
when
he
said
this
the
other
captains
flashed
their
swords
and
the
guards
clashed
their
shields
and
the
king
of
ireland
said
well
and
faithfully
am
i
guarded
indeed
and
luckier
am
i
than
any
other
king
on
the
earth
for
no
one
can
come
from
the
east
or
the
west
the
north
or
the
south
and
lay
the
weight
of
their
finger
upon
me
but
no
sooner
did
he
say
that
than
they
saw
a
giant
coming
across
the
hill
and
towards
the
place
where
they
were
standing
and
when
the
giant
came
to
them
he
lifted
up
his
hand
and
he
doubled
his
hand
into
a
fist
and
he
struck
the
king
of
ireland
full
in
the
mouth
and
he
knocked
out
three
of
his
teeth
he
picked
the
king
teeth
up
put
them
in
his
pouch
and
without
one
word
walked
past
them
and
went
down
to
the
sea
who
will
avenge
the
insult
put
upon
me
said
the
king
of
ireland
and
which
of
my
captains
will
go
and
win
back
for
me
the
three
best
teeth
i
had
but
not
one
of
his
captains
made
a
step
after
the
giant
i
know
now
said
the
king
how
well
you
serve
and
how
well
you
guard
me
well
if
none
of
you
will
help
me
and
if
none
of
you
will
avenge
me
i
find
those
who
will
and
now
make
a
proclamation
and
i
solemnly
declare
that
whoever
avenges
the
insult
offered
to
me
and
in
addition
brings
back
to
me
the
three
that
were
the
best
teeth
in
my
head
even
though
he
be
a
servant
or
the
son
of
a
servant
give
him
my
daughter
in
marriage
and
a
quarter
of
my
kingdom
and
more
than
that
said
he
i
make
him
full
captain
over
all
my
guards
the
proclamation
was
sent
all
over
the
castle
and
in
the
end
it
came
to
the
ears
of
the
swineherd
son
who
was
called
and
when
he
heard
it
he
rubbed
the
ashes
out
of
his
hair
and
he
said
to
his
grandmother
if
there
is
anything
in
the
world

want

into
the
boat
and
in
it
you
can

over
to
the
green
island
that
the
giant
rules
and

pot
of
balsam

off
now
on
your
journey
and
why
was
the
youth
called
said
the
to
the
he
was
called
because
he
had
sat
in
the
from
the
time
he
could
stand
upon
two
legs
and
everybody
who
called
him
thought
he
was
too
lazy
to
do
anything
else
well
he
left
behind
him
and
he
took
with
him
and
he
started
off
on
his
journey
with
the
cake
the
crutch
and
the
cure
he
followed
the
giant
tracks
until
they
came
down
to
the
sea
into
the
sea
he
flung
his
grandmother
crutch
it
became
a
boat
with
masts
and
sails
he
jumped
into
the
boat
and
the
things
that
had
to
be
done
in
a
boat
were
done
by
him
he
hoisted
the
sails
the
red
sail
the
black
sail
and
the
speckled
sail
he
gave
her
prow
to
the
sea
and
her
stern
to
the
land
the
blue
sea
was
flashing
the
green
sea
was
lashing
but
on
they
went
with
a
breeze
that
he
himself
would
have
chosen
and
the
little
creatures
of
the
sea
sat
up
on
their
tails
to
watch
his
going
and
so
he
went
until
he
came
near
the
green
island
where
the
giant
who
had
carried
off
the
three
teeth
of
the
king
of
ireland
had
his
castle
and
his
stronghold
he
fastened
his
boat
where
a
boat
should
be
fastened
and
he
went
through
the
island
until
he
came
to
a
high
grey
castle
no
one
was
about
it
and
he
went
through
it
gate
court
and
hall
he
found
a
chamber
where
a
fire
burned
on
the
he
went
to
the
fire
gladly
he
looked
around
the
chamber
and
he
saw
three
beds
there
room
to
rest
myself
here
at
all
events
said
night
came
on
and
he
left
the
fire
and
got
into
a
bed
he
pulled
one
of
the
soft
skins
over
him
just
as
he
was
going
to
turn
on
his
side
to
sleep
three
youths
came
into
the
chamber
sat
up
on
the
bed
to
look
at
them
when
they
saw
him
they
began
to
moan
and
groan
and
when
he
looked
them
over
he
saw
they
were
all
covered
with
wounds
with
and
with
the
sight
of
him
in
the
bed
more
than
their
wounds
made
them
moan
and
groan
and
when
he
asked
them
why
this
was
so
the
first
of
the
three
youths
said
we
came
here
the
three
of
us
to
fight
the
giant
and
to
take
from
this
island
the
stone
of
victory
we
came
to
this
castle
yesterday
and
we
made
three
beds
in
this
chamber
so
that
after
the
combat
we
might
rest
ourselves
and
be
healed
so
that
we
might
be
able
to
fight
the
giant
again
or
the
day
after
for
we
know
that
we
can
not
win
victory
over
him
until
many
combats
now
we
come
back
from
our
first
fight
and
we
find
you
in
one
of
the
beds
we
had
made
we
are
not
able
to
put
you
out
of
it
one
of
us
must
stay
out
of
bed
and
the
one
that
stays
out
will
die
then
we
shall
be
only
two
against
the
giant
and
he
will
kill
us
when
we
come
to
combat
again
and
when
the
first
one
had
said
all
this
the
three
youths
began
to
moan
and
groan
again
got
out
of
bed
you
can
have
your
rest
the
three
of
you
said
he
and
as
for
me
i
can
sit
by
the
fire
with
my
feet
in
the
ashes
as
often
as
i
did
before
the
three
youths
got
into
the
three
beds
and
when
they
were
in
them
took
the
pot
of
balsam
that
his
grandmother
had
given
him
and
rubbed
some
of
it
on
each
one
of
them
in
a
while
their
pain
and
their
weariness
left
them
and
their
wounds
closed
up
then
the
three
youths
sat
up
in
their
beds
and
they
told
their
story
illustration
cluck
cluck
said
the
and
what
was
the
story
they
told
cluck
cluck
said
the
wait
until

first
of
these
youths

this
island

is
a
moor
and
on
that
moor
there
is
a
stone
and
that
stone
is
not
known
from
other
stones
but
it
is
the
stone
of
victory
the
giant
has
not
been
able
to
find
it
himself
but
he
fights
with
all
who
come
here
to
find
it
we
went
to
the
moor
as
soon
as
we
got
there
the
giant
came
out
of
the
grey
castle
and
fought
with
us
we
fought
and
we
fought
but
he
wounded
us
so
sorely
that
we
were
like
to
die
of
our
wounds
we
came
back
to
rest
here
thanks
to
your
balsam
we
are
cured
of
our
wounds
we
go
to
fight
the
giant
and
with
the
surprise
he
get
at
seeing
us
before
him

to
overcome
him

the
surprise

and

in

the
four

were
seated
round
the
fire
when
a
little
man
came
into
the
chamber
he
carried
a
harp
in
his
hands
he
bowed
low
to
each
of
the
four
of
them

harper
he
said

the
harper
and
that

for

and
if

whole
world
was
before

when
i

and
if
every
one
in
it
had
the
pains
of
deep
wounds
the
playing
on
my
harp
would
make
each
and
every
one
of
them
fall
into
a
slumber
that
tune
we
must
not
hear
said
the
first
of
the
three
youths
for
if
we
fall
into
a
slumber
the
giant
will
see
to
it
that
we
shall
never
awaken
macdraoi
the
giant
harper
put
his
harp
to
his
chest
and
he
began
to
play
slumber
came
on
the
eyelids
of
the
four
who
were
at
the
fire
three
sprang
up
but
one
stayed
on
his
bench
asleep
one
yawned
and
fell
down
on
the
floor
one
of
the
two
that
remained
went
towards
the
harper
but
on
his
way
he
fell
across
a
bed
and
he
remained
on
it
then
out
of
the
four
only
one
was
left
awake
the
harper
played
on
put
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
and
commenced
to
gnaw
them
he
gnawed
the
first
two
fingers
down
to
their
joints
but
still
his
mouth
kept
open
in
a
yawn
and
still
the
slumber
kept
heavy
on
his
eyelids
he
gnawed
his
third
and
his
little
finger
then
he
put
his
right
hand
in
his
mouth
and
he
bit
at
his
thumb
and
he
bit
so
sharply
that
his
senses
nearly
all
came
back
to
him
with
a
kick
he
knocked
the
harp
out
of
the
harper
hands
he
caught
macdraoi
then
and
turned
him
head
below
heels
and
left
him
hanging
by
his
feet
from
a
beam
across
the
chamber
then
he
went
straight
through
the
hall
and
out
of
the
castle
a
wet
breeze
was
blowing
and
whatever
sleep
was
on
his
eye
it
blew
away
he
walked
on
with
the
dark
clouds
of
the
night
going
behind
him
and
the
bright
light
of
the
day
growing
before
him

he
when

found
himself
on
a
moor
and

walked
on
until

so
piercing
that

one
and
then
another
and

a
third
of
the
three
youths
wakened
up
then
when
they
were
on

the
giant

spread
themselves
out
so
that
they

for
all
his

the
giant
was

them
with
his
spear

him
down
on
his
side

struck
the
other
with
his
hand
and
brought
him
down
on
his
back

the
three
youths
told
they
would
help
him
to
find
what
he
had
come
to
seek
the
three
teeth
out
of
the
head
of
the
king
of
ireland
they
searched
and
they
searched
all
over
the
castle
at
last
one
of
them
opened
an
iron
press
and
there
on
a
shelf
was
a
silver
cup
and
in
the
cup
were
three
teeth

they
were
what
he
had
come
for
he
left
the
cup
beside
him
they
took
provisions
from
the
giant
store
put
them
on
the
table
and
began
to
eat
but
first
one
and
then
another
and
then
the
third
of
the
three
youths
made
an
excuse
and
left
the
table
went
on
with
his
breakfast
then
he
left
the
castle
to
look
for
the
three
youths
that
had
been
his
companions
he
did
not
find
them
he
went
down
to
the
he
saw
his
boat
and
the
sails
were
raised
on
it
in
the
boat
were
the
three
youths
and
they
were
making
ready
to
put
out
to
sea
shouted
to
them
then
one
of
the
youths
came
to
the
side
of
the
deck
and
spoke
back
to
him
you
found
the
stone
of
victory
without
knowing
it
said
he
and
you
let
us
take
it
in
our
hands
now
we
can
not
give
it
back
to
you
for
our
lives
depend
on
our
keeping
it
and
bringing
it
away
and
said
he
we
fear
to
stay
on
the
land
with
you
because
you
have
such
luck
that
you
could
take
the
stone
from
us
the
boat
we
came
in
is
gone
we
take
your
boat
and
we
think
that
you
have
such
luck
that
you
will
find
another
way
of
getting
off
the
island
remember
that
what
you
came
for
was
not
the
stone
of
victory
but
the
king
teeth
and
we
helped
to
find
them
for
you
they
had
hoisted
the
sails
and
now
a
wind
came
and
the
boat
that
was
from
his
grandmother
crutch
was
blown
out
of
the
harbour
and
was
left
without
any
companion
on
the
island
cluck
cluck
cluck
said
the
he
found
the
stone
of
victory
but
what
good
were
his
findings
to
him
when
he
did
know
what
he
had
found
and
he
let
it
be
taken
from
him
illustration
but
if
he
had
to
find
it
he
could
have
slain
the
giant
and
taken
the
cup
out
of
the
iron
cupboard
that
much
good
the
stone
of
victory
did
him
said
the
i
sorry
to

that
that
all

courtyard
of
the
grey
castle
and
he
found
there
a
great
eagle
that
was
chained
to
a
great
rock
the
eagle
came
towards
him
as
far
as
the
chain
would
let
him
feed
me
said
the
eagle
will
you
carry
me
to
ireland

said
he
went
through
courtyard
and
but
not
a
sheep
nor
a
pig
nor
a
bullock
could
he
find
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
not
be
able
to
find
meat
for
the
eagle
after
all
he
went
down
to
the
and
he
came
upon
a
pool
filled
with
thin
bony
fish
called
skates
he
took
a
basket
of
these
and
put
it
on
his
back
he
came
back
to
the
courtyard
and
he
unlocked
the
chain
that
held
the
eagle

the
eagle
and
he
opened
his
mouth

a
score
of
skates
into
his
mouth

said
the
eagle
but
he
gulped
them
down
holding
the
cup
in
his
hands
and
carrying
the
basket
of
skates
on
his
back
put
himself
between
the
wings
of
the
eagle
the
eagle
flew
up
and
over
the
grey
castle
and
faced
for
the
plain
of
the
sea
they
travelled
from
the
morning
light
until
the
full
noontide
the
eagle
opened
his
mouth
again
put
nothing
into
it
the
eagle
finding
nothing
in
his
mouth
dropped
down
to
the
sea
close
you
eyes
said
and
i
fill
your
mouth
the
eagle
closed
his
eyes
and
put
another
score
of
skates
into
his
mouth
the
eagle
gulped
them
all
down
whenever
i
open
my
mouth
you
will
have
to
feed
me
he
said
did
not
like
to
hear
this
for
a
score
more
of
skates
were
all
that
was
left
the
eagle
rose
up
again
and
on
and
on
he
flew
until
the
night
was
coming
over
the
water
he
opened
his
mouth
again
put
in
five
more
skates
the
eagle
kept
his
mouth
open
and
said
feed
me
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
then
but
to
put
in
the
rest
of
the
skates
flung
them
all
in
and
the
eagle
rose
up
and
flew
and
they
travelled
while
there
was
darkness
on
the
water
and
when
the
sun
rose
again
saw
they
were
flying
over
the
land
of
ireland
the
eagle
opened
his
mouth

nothing
to
put
into
it
fly
on
good

said
he
and
leave
me
down
at
the
king

the
eagle
i
will
give
you
what
you
never
had
before
a
whole
bullock
when
we
come
to
the
king
castle
cows
far
off

long
horns
said
the
eagle
mocking
him
with
that
he
flung
off
his
back
sore
would
his
fall
have
been
if
it
had
been
on
any
other
place
but
a
soft
bog
on
the
softest
of
soft
bogs
he
fell
he
made
a
hole
in
the
ground
but
no
bone
in
his
body
was
broken
and
he
still
held
the
cup
in
his
hands
he
rose
up
covered
with
the
mud
of
the
bog
and
he
started
off
for
the
castle
cluck
cluck
said
the
and
did
he
not
go
to
see
his
grandmother
at
all
illustration
if
he
did
it
not
in
the
story
said
the
that
very
day
as
i
would
have
you
know
the
king
was
standing
outside
the
gate
of
his
castle
with
his
powerful
captains
and
his
guards
around
him
year
it
is
said
the
king
the
giant
came
and
struck
me
in
the
mouth
knocking
out
and
taking
away
three
of
my
teeth
and
since
that
day
i
have
had
neither
health
nor
prosperity
and
you
know
said
he
my
daughter
and
a
quarter
of
my
kingdom
is
to
go
to
the
one
who
will
avenge
the
insult
and
bring
back
my
three
teeth
and
such
a
thing
prevented
me
from
going
said
one
of
his
captains
now
that
so
and
so
is
done
i
can
go
and
avenge
the
insult
offered
to
you
and
so
kept
me
from
going
said
another
of
the
captains
now
that
such
and
such
a
thing
is
done
i
can
go
and
bring
you
back
your
three
teeth
am
tired
of
hearing
you
all
talk
said
the
king
it
my
belief
that
my
teeth
will
be
lost
and
my
daughter
unwedded
till
the
day
of
doom
it
was
then
that
appeared
before
them
good
health
to
you
king
said
he
good
health
to
you
good
man
said
the
king
and
what
may
i
ask
have
you
come
here
for
he
was
covered
with
the
feathers
of
the
eagle
and
the
mud
of
the
bog
and
as
you
may
be
sure
the
king
and
the
captains
and
the
guards
looked
sourly
at
him
i
have
come
first
of
all
king
said
he
to
give
you
advice
and
what
is
your
advice
asked
the
king
my
advice
to
you
is
that
you
send
away
all
these
you
have
around
you
your
captains
and
your
guards
and
that
you
turn
them
into
or
or
anything
else
in
which
they
would
give
useful
service
for
as
they
are
here
they
can
neither
serve
nor
guard
you
all
that
may
be
true
said
the
king
but
what
right
have
you
to
say
it
said
nothing
but
he
held
the
cup
up
to
the
king
and
the
king
saw
three
teeth
in
it
and
he
took
them
out
and
placed
them
in
his
mouth
and
the
teeth
went
into
their
places
and
there
firmly
they
stayed
then
told
how
he
had
gone
to
the
green
island
and
how
he
had
avenged
the
insult
offered
to
the
king
and
how
he
had
got
what
he
had
gone
to
search
for
then
he
demanded
the
king
daughter
in
marriage
and
a
quarter
of
the
kingdom
and
both
were
made
over
to
him
on
the
spot
as
for
the
powerful
captains
and
the
guards
some
of
them
were
made
and
some
were
made
and
was
made
captain
over
the
new
guards
when
he
came
to
rule
a
quarter
of
the
kingdom
he
was
given
a
horse
and
made
a
duke
and
he
was
called
by
a
better
name
than
but
what
that
name
was
i
do
remember
now
cluck
cluck
cluck
said
the
and
did
he
go
to
visit
the
grandmother
at
all
if
he
did
said
the
that
another
story
and
if
it
was
ever
told
i
do
remember
it
pray
go

the
thirteen
little
wrens
sat
on
the
wall
in
the
garden
and
their
mother
was
there
to
teach
them
to
fly
one
called
them
the
little
wrens
but
really
each
one
was
as
big
as
their
mother
she
had
a
tail
however
that
was
most
cunningly
cocked
and
they
had
no
tails
and
the
consequence
was
that
when
they
made
their
little
flights
they
always
went
sideways
moreover
their
beaks
were
still
yellow
and
wide
and
open
and
this
is
always
a
sign
of
the
young
bird
all
i
ask
of
you
said
the
mother
is
that
when
you
go
into
the
world
you
remember
that
you
are
the
children
of
the
king
of
the
birds
now
why
does
our
mother
call
us
the
children
of
the
king
of
the
birds
said
one
little
wren
to
the
other
i
think
we
really
very
small
and
i
think
our
mother
is
very
small
and
there
our
father
behind
that
and
he
very
small
too
illustration
and
wherever
you
go
be
sure
to
conduct
yourselves
like
the
children
of
the
king
of
the
birds
said
the
mother
it
because
we
were
reared
in
such
a
fine
nest
said
another
little
wren
no
other
birds
in
the
world
had
ever
a
finer
nest
than
we
have
had
that
the
reason
we
called
the
children
of
the
king
of
the
birds
men
call
the
wren
the
king
of
the
birds
said
the
father
wren
as
he
flew
up
on
a
tree
and
surely
men
ought
to
know
who
is
the
king
of
the
birds
why
do
men
call
the
wren
the
king
of
the
birds
said
the
little
wrens
i
will
tell
you
said
the
mother
as
we
fly
from
the
wall
to
the
tree
and
from
the
tree
back
to
the
wall
i
will
tell
you
why
men
honor
the
wren
as
the
king
of
the
birds
she
spent
a
whole
day
telling
the
little
wrens
the
story
and
the
boy
who
knew
what
the
birds
said
was
there
and
he
heard
the
whole
of
the
king
of
the
of
the
mountain
conquered
the
two
villages
of
and
and
the
very
day
he
conquered
he
ordered
the
two
headmen
to
come
before
him
you
two
headmen
are
to
see
that
your
villages
and
send
me
my
rightful
tribute
said
the
king
to
them
there
is
much
we
can
send
said
the
headman
of
a
string
of
salmon
said
the
headman
of
a
basket
of
plover
eggs
said
the
headman
of
no
said
the
king
the
tribute
that
each
of
your
villages
must
send
me
is
the
king
of
the
birds
the
two
headmen
went
back
to
their
villages
and
that
very
day
each
told
at
the
council
what
tribute
the
king
had
ordered
them
to
send
the
king
of
the
birds
said
the
people
of
that
the
eagle
surely
the
king
of
the
birds
said
the
people
of
what
bird
might
that
be
we
have
to
give
thought
to
this
the
people
of
thought
about
it
and
thought
about
it
but
the
people
of
declared
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
about
it
the
eagle
was
the
king
of
the
birds
and
while
the
people
of
were
thinking
and
pondering
the
people
of
were
sending
their
young
men
off
to
catch
an
eagle
but
an
eagle
is
a
hard
fowl
to
catch
and
the
people
of
found
they
had
to
send
all
of
their
young
men
out
and
to
send
them
out
every
day
and
the
young
men
climbed
high
hills
and
stony
ditches
and
they
searched
the
east
and
they
hunted
the
west
they
went
out
at
sunrise
and
they
came
back
at
sunset
but
never
an
eagle
did
they
bring
with
them
it
may
be
that
the
eagle
is
the
king
of
the
birds
said
the
people
of
but
we
had
better
consider
it
they
thought
about
it
from
sunrise
to
sunset
they
thought
about
it
while
they
plowed
their
fields
and
sowed
them
while
they
spun
their
cloth
and
made
their
coats
while
they
mended
their
nets
and
mended
their
shoes
while
they
thatched
their
roofs
and
planted
their
and
in
there
was
few
left
to
plow
the
fields
and
sow
them
to
spin
cloth
and
to
make
coats
to
mend
nets
and
to
mend
shoes
to
thatch
roofs
and
to
plant
there
was
few
left
to
do
these
things
for
all
the
young
men
were
out
on
the
mountain
hunting
for
an
eagle
the
people
of
will
be
ruined
said
the
people
of
they
have
done
nothing
yet
to
catch
the
eagle
when
the
king
gets
no
tribute
from
them
he
come
down
and
sell
them
and
their
village
call
the
young
men
back
that
have
gone
into
the
fields
to
work
and
send
them
up
the
mountain
again
at
last
the
people
of
caught
their
eagle
a
great
golden
eagle
he
was
they
built
for
him
a
shed
and
they
fed
him
on
what
lambs
they
had
that
year
we
safe
anyway
said
the
people
of
but
the
unfortunate
folk
in
have
lost
their
chance
they
not
have
time
to
catch
an
eagle
now
the
time
was
coming
near
when
the
two
villages
would
have
to
send
their
tribute
to
the
king
we
have
our
eagle
said
the
people
of
but
o
bad
fortune
we
have
hardly
a
crop
growing
this
will
be
a
hard
year
for
us
we
have
lambs
to
grow
into
sheep
even
we
have
our
crops
said
the
people
of
but
bad
cess
to
it
what
are
we
to
do
about
paying
our
tribute
to
the
king
and
still
they
could
decide
whether
it
was
the
eagle
or
the
cuckoo
or
the
woodpecker
that
was
king
of
the
birds
they
were
still
considering
it
when
the
king
messenger
came
to
bid
them
come
with
their
tribute
to
the
king
castle
what
were
the
people
of
to
do
they
searched
round
and
about
but
no
bird
at
all
could
they
find
and
then
as
he
was
being
marched
off
the
headman
put
his
hand
under
the
thatch
of
his
house
and
took
out
a
wren
that
was
sheltering
there
he
put
the
wren
under
his
hat
and
went
off
with
the
king
messenger
and
there
before
him
on
the
way
to
the
king
castle
was
the
headman
of
the
riders
of
the
village
were
with
him
and
they
bore
their
golden
eagle
most
triumphantly
give
to
my
falconer
the
king
of
the
birds
said
the
king
the
headman
of
presented
the
eagle
it
is
well
said
the
king
and
where
have
you
said
he
to
the
headman
of
bestowed
the
king
of
the
birds
the
headman
put
his
hand
under
his
hat
and
handed
over
the
wren
to
the
king
falconer
tush
said
the
king
why
do
you
call
this
the
king
of
the
birds
the
headman
of
was
going
to
say
because
his
family
is
great
but
he
said
instead
because
he
flies
the
highest
my
lord
if
it
be
truth
it
unknown
to
me
said
the
king
but
it
shall
be
tried
out
then
said
he
to
the
royal
falconer
let
the
eagle
and
the
wren
soar
together
and
when
the
eagle
outsoars
the
wren
it
shall
be
proved
that
the
headman
of
is
a
catiff
and
his
village
and
everyone
in
it
will
be
sold
to
the
saracens
but
if
it
so
happens
that
the
wren
outsoars
the
eagle
the
tribute
sent
from
the
village
of
must
be
accepted
the
eagle
and
the
wren
rose
from
the
same
perch
and
soared
up
together
up
and
up
the
eagle
went
so
far
my
father
went
but
i
shall
go
farther
said
the
eagle
higher
and
higher
he
rose
so
far
my
grandfather
went
but
i
shall
go
farther
farther
and
farther
he
soared
so
far
went
my
and
no
eagle
again
will
fly
so
high
his
wings
were
stiff
and
tired
no
bird
will
ever
this
flight
of
mine
said
the
eagle
he
went
to
close
his
wings
so
that
he
might
rest
them
as
he
went
down
but
as
he
did
the
wren
came
from
under
his
wings
up
went
the
wren
down
went
the
eagle
up
and
up
went
the
wren
he
had
been
resting
while
the
eagle
had
been
flying
and
now
he
was
able
to
soar
past
the
point
the
eagle
had
reached
at
his
the
eagle
flew
down
and
lighted
on
the
falconer
perch
has
he
flown
high
falconer
asked
the
king
no
bird
has
flown
so
high
said
the
falconer
by
the
rime
on
his
wings
he
has
gone
into
the
line
of
frost
the
eagle
is
king
of
the
birds
and
no
one
can
deny
it
said
the
king
the
village
of
has
not
sent
me
my
tribute
mercy
said
the
headman
of
the
village
and
all
in
it
shall
be
sold
to
the
saracens
said
the
king
just
then
the
wren
came
down
and
lighted
on
the
perch
beside
the
eagle
where
did
the
wren
fly
to
said
the
king
by
my
glove
said
the
falconer
he
soared
past
the
line
of
frost
and
went
into
the
line
of
snow
for
what
on
his
feathers
is
a
drop
of
snow
the
wren
is
king
of
the
birds
said
the
headman
of
yes
king
of
the
birds
said
the
king
and
therefore
my
lawful
tribute
illustration
no
bird
will
ever
this
flight
of
mine
said
the
eagle
and
so
for
ever
after
the
villages
sent
to
the
king
not
an
eagle
but
a
wren
as
tribute
and
in
no
village
ever
after
were
the
lands
unplowed
and
the
fields
unsown
the
cloth
unspun
and
the
coats
not
made
the
roofs
unthatched
and
the
unplanted
and
in
every
village
in
the
hollow
and
on
the
height
the
people
shouted
for
the
wren
the
wren
the
wren
the
king
of
all
birds

was
a
young

girl
but
young
as
she
was
she
would
have
to
be
married

said
then
married
she
was
while
she
was
still
little
enough
to
walk
through
the
doorway
of
her
hut
without
stooping
her
head
her
husband
was
a
hunter
and
he
took
her
to
live
in
a
hut
at
the
edge
of
a
wood
he
was
out
hunting
the
whole
of
the
day
now
what
did
do
while
she
had
the
house
to
herself
little
enough
indeed
she
swept
the
floor
and
she
washed
the
dishes
and
she
laid
them
back
on
their
shelf
then
she
went
to
the
well
for
pails
of
water
when
she
went
out
she
stayed
long
for
first
she
would
look
into
the
well
at
her
own
image
and
then
she
would
make
a
wreath
of
flowers
and
put
it
on
her
head
and
look
at
herself
again
after
that
maybe
she
would
delay
to
pick
berries
and
eat
them
then
she
would
go
without
hurrying
along
the
path
singing
to
when
he
saw
me
all
in
blue
who
is
the
maid
the
sky
must
woo
when
he
saw
me
all
in

she
would
have
got
back
to
the
hut
the
fire
on
the
hearth
would
have
gone
out
and
she
would
have
to
light
it
again
and
then
sweep
the
floor
clear
of
the
ashes
that
had
blown
upon
it
after
that
she
would
have
little
time
to
do
anything
else
except
prepare
a
meal
against
the
time
when
her
husband
would
be
back
from
his
hunting
one
morning
her
husband
left
his
coat
down
on
the
bench
my
coat
is
torn
sew
it
for
me
he
said

she
would
do
that
but
she
did
no
more
to
the
coat
than
take
it
up
and
leave
it
down
again
on
the
bench
the
next
day
her
husband
said
my
vest
is
torn
too
have
it
and
the
coat
sewn
for
me
he
left
the
vest
beside
the
coat
and
went
out
to
his
hunting
did
nothing
to
the
coat
and
nothing
to
the
vest
and
every
day
for
a
week
her
husband
went
out
without
coat
or
vest
upon
him
one
day
he
put
on
his
torn
coat
and
his
torn
vest
and
went
out
to
his
hunting
when
he
came
home
that
evening
he
had
a
bundle
of
wool
with
him
your
said
he
sends
you
this
bundle
of
wool
and
she
bids
you
spin
it
that
there
may
be
cloth
for
new
clothes
for
me
i
will
spin
it
said
but
the
next
day
when
her
husband
went
away
she
did
what
she
had
always
done
before
she
went
to
the
well
and
she
looked
for
long
at
her
image
she
put
a
wreath
of
flowers
on
her
head
and
she
looked
at

again
she
picked

had
to
light
the
fire
again
when
she
came
in
and
sweep
away
the
ashes
that
had
gathered
on
the
floor
and
after
she
had
done
all
that
it
was
time
to
prepare
the
meal
for
the
evening
but
before
her
husband
came
home
she
took
the
spinning
wheel
out
of
the
corner
and
put
it
near
the
light
of
the
doorway
i
see
said
her
husband
that
you
are
going
to
spin
the
wool
for
my
clothes

the
next
day
she
did
as
she
done
every
day
and
no
wool
was
spun
the
day
after
she
put
wool
on
the
wheel
and
gave
it
a
few
turns
in
a
week
from
that
evening
she
had
one
ball
of
thread
spun
your
bids
me
ask
you
how
much
of
the
wool
have
you
spun
said
her
husband
to
her
one
evening
was
so
much
afraid
that
her
husband
would
send
her
to
her
through
the
dark
dark
wood
that
she
said
i
have
spun
many
balls
your
bade
me
count
the
balls
you
have
spun
said
her
husband
i
will
go
up
to
the
loft
and
throw
them
down
to
you
and
then
you
will
throw
them
back
to
me
and
we
will
count
them
that
way
said
she
went
up
to
the
loft
and
she
flung
down
the
ball

had
spun
one
said
her
husband
and
he
threw
it
back
to
her

flung
him
the
ball
again

her
husband
and
he
flung
it
back
to

son
and
the
princess
bright
brow
the

and
the
princess
bright
brow
illustration
everyone
in
and
around
the
king
castle
despised
mell
the
son
said
the
stonechecker
the
bird
that
built
within
the
stones
of
the
tower
and
it
was
not
because
there
was
anything
mean
about
the
lad
himself
it
was
because
his
mother
the
had
the
lowest
office
about
the
king
castle
this
is
what
a
did
she
had
to
mind
the
fowl
and
keep
count
of
them
she
had
to
gather
the
eggs
and
put
them
into
a
basket
and
send
them
to
the
king
steward
every
day
and
for
doing
this
she
had
as
wages
the
right
to
go
to
the
of
the
steward
house
and
get
from
the
two
meals
a
day
for
herself
and
mell
her
son
and
everybody
as
i
said
despised
this
son
of
hers
and
and
the
grooms
around
the
castle
but
of
course
no
one
despised
mell
more
than
did
the
king
daughter
princess
bright
brow
she
used
to
go
into
a
wood
and
whisper
along
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
one
day
the
son
whom
she
despised
so
much
made
answer
to
her
he
was
lying
along
the
branch
of
the
tree
watching
his
goat
that
grazed
on
the
grass
below
now
this
is
what
princess
bright
brow
said
to
the
tree
and
this
is
what
she
used
to
say
to
it
every
above
the
rest
which
of
the
heroes
loves
me
best
mell
was
lying
along
the
branch
as
i
have
said
and
he
made
answer
back
to
princess
princess
he
at
your
call
and
the
son
loves
you
best
of
all
the
king
daughter
looked
up
and
she
saw
the
son
on
the
branch
and
she
went
into
a
great
rage
she
gave
orders
to
the
grooms
that
the
son
was
to
be
whipped
every
time
he
looked
at
her
many
the
time
after
that
mell
got
the
lash
but
he
loved
bright
brow
so
much
that
he
could
not
forbear
looking
at
her
ii
now
one
very
early
morning
mell
took
his
mother
goat
out
to
graze
on
the
green
and
as
he
went
along
he
saw
on
the
grass
a
beautiful
mantle
he
took
it
up
and
he
thought
to
himself
how
well
it
would
look
upon
princess
bright
brow
and
he
thought
again
if
she
would
take
this
beautiful
green
mantle
from
me
maybe
she
would
let
me
look
upon
her
when
she
is
wearing
it
he
put
the
mantle
across
his
shoulders
and
sat
down
and
thought
and
thought
and
while
he
was
thinking
he
felt
the
mantle
being
pulled
from
behind
he
turned
round
and
he
saw
a
woman
standing
there
she
had
brighter
colors
in
her
dress
and
she
wore
more
ornaments
than
any
one
he
had
ever
seen
in
the
king
castle
he
knew
by
such
signs
that
she
was
a
fairy
woman
out
of
the
green
rath
illustration
mell
said
she
mell
the
son
give
to
me
the
mantle
that
the
king
of
the
fairy
riders
let
fall
from
his
shoulders
last
night
if
it
is
his
and
if
you
have
come
to
bring
it
to
him
why
you
must
have
it
said
mell
and
he
took
the
mantle
off
his
shoulders
and
handed
it
to
her
the
king
would
wish
that
i
should
recompense
you
said
the
fairy
woman
she
took
a
jewel
that
was
on
the
collar
of
the
mantle
and
gave
it
to
mell
if
you
take
this
jewel
in
your
hand
said
she
and
wish
to
be
in
this
place
or
that
place
you
will
be
there
in
an
instant
and
anyone
you
take
by
the
hand
you
can
bring
with
you
and
when
mell
took
the
jewel
from
her
the
fairy
woman
carrying
the
green
mantle
went
into
the
green
rath
then
mell
took
his
goat
by
the
horns
and
turned
towards
his
hut
and
there
outside
the
gate
of
the
castle
he
saw
the
king
daughter
princess
bright
brow
she
was
watching
the
falconer
training
the
young
hawks
and
the
grooms
and
the
riders
of
the
castle
were
behind
her
when
she
saw
mell
with
his
hands
on
the
goat
horns
she
grew
high
in
rage
and
she
turned
to
the
grooms
to
give
an
order
that
he
be
beaten
with
the
whips
they
held
but
mell
ran
to
her
and
he
caught
her
hand
and
holding
the
jewel
he
said
i
wish
that
i
was
in
the
island
of
the
shadow
of
the
stars
and
that
this
young
girl
was
with
me
the
hawk
flew
at
him
and
the
hound
sprang
at
him
and
the
whips
struck
at
him
and
while
he
was
still
expecting
the
feel
of
teeth
and
claws
and
lash
he
was
away
and
was
in
another
country
altogether
there
was
neither
hawk
nor
hound
nor
hut
nor
castle
nor
groom
nor
falconer
two
beings
only
were
there
and
they
were
mell
the
son
and
the
king
daughter
princess
bright
brow
in
what
country
are
we
said
princess
bright
brow
unless
we
are
in
the
island
of
the
shadow
of
the
stars
i
do
know
where
we
are
said
mell
the
son
you
are
the
son
and
you
have
brought
me
here
by
enchantment
said
bright
brow
she
wanted
to
go
from
him
but
where
was
she
to
go
to
all
the
country
was
strange
to
her
and
so
if
she
made
two
steps
away
from
him
she
soon
made
two
steps
back
to
him
and
the
end
of
this
part
of
the
story
is
that
bright
brow
became
friendly
to
the
son
he
gathered
fruits
off
trees
and
he
snared
birds
and
he
took
the
fish
out
of
rivers
and
he
found
sheltered
places
to
sleep
in
and
often
the
princess
bright
brow
was
good
and
kind
to
him
and
mell
the
son
was
now
as
happy
as
anyone
in
the
world
since
we
are
so
friendly
to
each
other
now
said
bright
brow
to
him
one
day
will
you
not
tell
me
how
you
were
able
to
come
here
and
bring
me
with
you
it
was
because
of
the
jewel
i
wear
at
my
breast
said
mell
and
then
he
told
how
he
had
found
the
green
mantle
on
the
ground
and
how
the
fairy
woman
gave
him
the
jewel
and
what
power
the
jewel
had
if
mell
was
content
to
be
on
the
island
bright
brow
was
not
and
so
one
evening
when
he
was
asleep
she
lifted
up
the
mantle
and
took
the
jewel
that
was
on
his
breast
then
holding
it
in
her
hand
she
said
i
wish
i
was
back
in
my
father
castle
in
an
instant
she
was
back
there
now
all
her
maids
were
around
her
and
all
of
them
were
crying
where
have
you
been
king
daughter
where
have
you
been
and
bright
brow
told
them
that
the
king
of
the
fairy
riders
had
taken
her
away
to
show
her
all
the
great
heroes
of
the
world
so
that
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
choose
a
husband
she
could
make
her
choice
of
the
best
amongst
them
as
for
mell
the
son
when
he
wakened
up
and
found
that
bright
brow
had
gone
and
that
the
jewel
was
gone
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
more
sad
and
lonely
than
he
was
he
thought
that
she
might
come
back
to
him
but
the
moon
came
and
the
sun
came
and
bright
brow
came
not
he
longed
to
be
a
bird
that
he

thought

now
the
trees
that

within

walls
seemed
not
much
bigger
than
the
bushes
the

women
put
clothes
to
dry
on
sitting
on
his
black
horse
he
looked
across

was
surprised
to
see
that
they
had
not
learnt
to
straighten
up
their
shoulders
nor
to
walk
as
if
there
was
a
fine
thought
in

and
a
champion
all
in
red
sprang
out
of

and
when
he
had
touched
the
shingles
he
struck

and
he
shouted
if

king
of

land
has
a
champion
equal
to

cave
where

a
bush
being
pulled
towards

then
when

not
able
to
do
anything
more
than
guard
himself
from
the
strokes
of

sword
while

drew
towards

you

have
the
honors
of

into

as

sinking
the

over

sea
now
the

from

going
off

sad
and
she
has
reason
for
being
sad
and
troubled
said
the
damsel
who
was
called
sea
swan
for
she
thinks
she
may
have
to
marry
one
whom
she
thinks
little
of
why
should

be
said
mell
because

has
promised
to

half
his

to
the
one
who
will
defeat
the
red
champion
who

come
from

demands
that
the

give
him
tribute
from

land
and
the
only
one
who
has
gone
forth
against
the

the
son
a
fellow
that

a
would
marry

if

stars
if

had
the
jewel
that

bring
her
there
she
had
it
once
but
a
fairy
woman
came
out
of

green
rath
and
made

give
it
to

went
shaking
and
when

looked
at
him

little
hen
that

the
mother
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
may
do
so
said
the
cock
condescendingly
when
they
were
beside
the
sunny
wall
the
hens
on
the
ground
scattering
dust
over
their
feathers
and
their
lord
standing
on
one
leg
with
his
comb
hanging
over
one
eye
the
cock
said
no
cock
of
our
breed
ever
told
this
story
before
they
would
not
frighten
the
hens
with
it
however
since
you
have
persuaded
me
i
will
tell
you
the
tale
my
grandfather
told
it
to
my
father
who
told
it
to
me
it
is
the
story
of
the
big
man
who
came
to
this
place
and
who
wore
the
ring
of
brass
that
we
uncovered
he
did
not
put
it
over
his
head
as
you
might
think
from
the
size
of
the
ring
no
he
wore
it
on
his
arm
never
was
a
bigger
man
seen
by
anyone
living
the
whole
countryside
stood
outside
their
houses
to
see
him
come
over
the
hills
when
he
came
to
where
the
stones
are
he
stooped
down
to
take
a
drink
and
he
drank
the
well
dry
the
people
came
out
of
the
house
to
meet
him
and
he
spoke
to
them
and
out
of
what
he
said
to
them
they
drew
his
story
as
i
am
to
a
bantam
the
big
man
was
to
the
other
men
of
the
country
and
if
they
were
surprised
at
his
bigness
he
was
astonished
at
their
smallness
for
he
came
from
a
time
when
all
were
as
big
as
he
a
hundred
and
a
hundred
years
before
he
had
hunted
with
his
companions
and
he
was
then
called
not
big
man
but
little
fawn
and
one
day
a
hundred
and
a
hundred
years
ago
it
was
he
had
gone
to
chase
a
deer
the
deer
fled
into
a
cave
he
followed
with
his
hounds
and
his
sword
his
trumpet
and
his
he
went
astray
and
fell
asleep
in
the
cave
and
when
he
wakened
up
his
hounds
were
heaps
of
dust
beside
him
he
went
into
the
world
and
he
found
that
his
companions
were
dead
for
a
hundred
and
a
hundred
years
and
that
the
men
of
the
earth
had
become
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
cave
he
left
his
sword
and
his
trumpet
and
his
the
cock
put
his
two
feet
on
the
ground
and
shook
his
red
comb
from
over
his
left
to
over
his
right
eye
then
said
he
everyone
in
the
house
was
friendly
to
little
fawn
except
one
person
murrish
the
from
the
first
day
he
came
there
were
disputes
between
them
big
men
have
big
appetites
said
she
to
him
the
day
he
came
and
so
i
will
give
you
two
eggs
for
your
supper
but
when
she
handed
him
the
eggs
little
fawn
said
it
was
not
the
eggs
of
the
we
were
wont
to
eat
in
my
time
eggs
of
the
said
murrish
i
have
handed
you
the
biggest
eggs
laid
by
the
best
hens
in
the
country
in
my
time
there
were
bigger
eggs
in
the
nest
of
the
said
little
fawn
illustration
all
flew
from
the
mountain
except
one
bird
and
he
was
the
greatest
amongst
them
all
the
next
day
she
gave
him
a
for
his
breakfast
he
ate
it
and
then
sent
the
boy
ardan
was
his
name
to
ask
what
else
she
was
going
to
give
him
give
him
said
murrish
the
i
have
given
him
a
whole
barley
cake
and
that
is
enough
for
two
men
breakfasts
tell
her
said
little
fawn
that
i
often
saw
an
that
was
as
big
as
her
barley
cake
tell
him
said
murrish
the
that
i
am
not
here
to
listen
to
old
men
romances
now
when
he
heard
that
his
words
were
taken
as
old
men
romances
little
fawn
was
an
angry
man
he
was
hungry
for
the
food
he
got
did
not
stay
his
appetite
but
what
murrish
said
in
doubt
of
his
word
gave
him
more
hurt
than
his
hunger
did
for
in
his
day
and
amongst
his
companions
a
lie
was
never
told
and
nothing
a
man
said
was
ever
doubted
the
next
day
he
sent
back
the
dish
for
more
butter
tell
him
said
murrish
the
that
i
put
a
whole
pat
of
butter
on
his
dish
enough
to
do
two
men
for
two
days
tell
her
said
little
fawn
that
often
i
saw
a
rowan
berry
that
was
bigger
as
her
pat
of
butter
the
child
just
out
of
the
cradle
would
not
believe
that
story
said
murrish
the
she
sent
him
a
quarter
of
mutton
for
his
dinner
little
fawn
told
ardan
to
ask
murrish
for
more
as
the
dinner
she
gave
him
left
him
hungry
still
did
he
not
get
a
whole
quarter
of
mutton
for
his
dinner
said
murrish
a
whole
quarter
of
mutton
did
she
say
said
little
fawn
often
i
saw
a
quarter
of
a
blackbird
that
was
bigger
than
her
quarter
of
mutton
a
quarter
of
a
blackbird
bigger
than
my
quarter
of
mutton
tell
him
that
if
he
never
lied
before
he
lies
now
said
murrish
does
she
say
that
said
little
fawn
then
i
swear
i
shall
never
rest
in
the
house
nor
be
easy
in
my
mind
until
i
bring
her
an
ivy
leaf
that
is
as
big
as
her
barley
loaf
and
a
rowan
berry
that
is
as
big
as
her
pat
of
butter
and
if
i
bring
these
said
he
it
may
not
be
needful
for
me
to
get
her
the
blackbird
that
is
as
big
in
one
quarter
as
the
quarter
of
mutton
that
she
gave
me
for
my
dinner
there
and
then
he
went
from
the
house
and
ardan
the
boy
went
with
him
they
went
east
and
they
went
west
they
went
towards
the
north
and
towards
the
south
but
no
ivy
leaf
did
they
find
that
was
as
big
as
a
barley
loaf
and
no
rowan
berry
did
they
see
that
was
as
big
as
a
pat
of
butter
little
fawn
was
troubled
and
downcast
they
came
back
to
the
house
and
murrish
the
was
pleased
when
she
heard
from
ardan
that
they
found
no
ivy
leaf
and
saw
no
rowan
berry
that
was
as
big
as
her
barley
loaf
or
her
pat
of
butter
there
is
only
one
thing
i
can
do
now
said
little
fawn
and
that
is
to
bring
her
the
blackbird
that
is
as
big
in
one
quarter
as
the
quarter
of
mutton
she
gave
me
for
my
dinner
and
that
said
he
to
ardan
will
take
time
and
trouble
and
the
meeting
of
danger
to
bring
about
time
and
trouble
said
the
hen
time
and
trouble
why
did
he
say
time
and
trouble
o
top
of
wisdom
said
the
blue
hen
hush
now
said
the
little
hen
that
was
the
mother
hush
now
and
let
the
of
my
heart
tell
what
best
in
the
story
little
fawn
was
an
old
man
and
feeble
when
he
came
to
the
house
said
the
cock
and
now
he
was
nearly
blind
his
mind
would
not
be
at
rest
he
told
ardan
until
he
brought
to
murrish
and
showed
her
a
blackbird
that
was
as
big
in
one
quarter
as
the
quarter
of
mutton
she
gave
him
for
his
dinner
but
before
i
can
take
that
blackbird
said
he
i
must
have
a
hound
there
is
a
hound
in
the
yard
but
i
have
tried
her
and
found
she
is
weak
and
fearful
she
will
have
puppies
and
one
of
her
puppies
maybe
will
do
and
he
told
ardan
to
tell
him
when
the
puppies
came
to
the
hound
that
was
in
the
yard
then
one
day
ardan
came
and
told
him
that
there
was
a
litter
of
puppies
with
the
hound
that
is
well
said
little
fawn
and
in
a
while
we
will
try
if
one
has
the
strength
and
courage
enough
to
help
us
to
take
the
blackbird
he
told
ardan
what
to
do
he
was
to
take
the
skin
that
had
been
stripped
off
a
dead
horse
and
he
was
to
nail
this
skin
upon
a
door
in
the
yard
then
he
was
to
do
a
curious
thing
he
was
to
take
up
each
puppy
and
fling
it
against
the
door
ardan
did
all
this
and
little
fawn
stood
by
and
heard
the
puppies
yowling
as
they
fell
on
the
ground
they
scampered
away
then
he
heard
nothing
except
ardan
laugh
why
are
you
laughing
my
boy
said
little
fawn
i
laugh
to
see
what
the
last
puppy
is
doing
said
ardan
and
what
is
he
doing
said
little
fawn
he
has
not
fallen
to
the
ground
like
the
others
he
has
caught
hold
of
the
horseskin
with
his
teeth
and
he
is
holding
on
to
it
that
puppy
will
do
said
little
fawn
he
has
strength
and
courage
take
him
and
rear
him
away
from
the
others
and
when
he
comes
to
his
full
strength
you
and
i
will
take
him
to
hunt
the
blackbird
that
is
as
big
in
one
quarter
as
the
quarter
of
mutton
murrish
the
gave
me
for
my
dinner
we
must
make
our
word
good
this
time
good
lad
ardan
took
away
the
puppy
conbeg
they
called
him
from
the
others
and
reared
him
up
little
fawn
tested
his
strength
and
courage
in
many
ways
at
length
he
was
satisfied
one
day
he
put
a
leash
on
conbeg
and
he
told
the
boy
to
come
with
him
little
fawn
and
ardan
and
conbeg
the
young
hound
went
away
from
the
house
is
the
best
part
of
the
story
said
the
little
hen
that
was
the
cock
mother
it
is
it
is
said
the
hen
and
how
well
he
tells
it
the
top
of
wisdom
said
the
blue
hen
i
tell
it
as
my
father
told
me
and
as
his
father
told
him
said
the
cock
changing
legs
the
first
place
they
went
was
into
the
cave
where
the
big
man
had
lain
for
a
hundred
and
a
hundred
years
they
found
there
the
heap
of
dust
that
was
his
two
hounds
and
they
found
too
the
of
brass
and
the
trumpet
and
the
great
sword
they
left
the
cave
and
they
turned
south
and
they
went
on
and
on
till
they
came
to
the
mountain
that
is
called
the
boy
and
the
man
and
the
hound
rested
themselves
for
a
while
on
the
level
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
then
little
fawn
told
ardan
to
take
the
trumpet
and
put
it
to
his
mouth
he
blew
on
the
trumpet
o
louder
than
ever
i
crowed
was
the
noise
he
made
on
that
trumpet
the
trees
that
were
growing
on
the
mountain
top
shook
at
the
sound
blow
again
said
little
fawn
and
ardan
blew
again
and
he
blew
louder
now
look
into
the
sky
said
little
fawn
and
tell
me
what
you
see
coming
towards
us
ardan
looked
for
a
long
time
and
at
last
he
saw
what
he
thought
was
a
cloud
coming
towards
the
and
then
he
saw
that
the
cloud
was
a
flock
of
birds
they
came
to
the
and
lighted
on
the
ground
peewits
blackbirds
starlings
finches
linnets
and
each
was
bigger
than
any
bird
he
had
ever
seen
the
birds
were
hardly
afraid
of
the
hound
but
conbeg
went
amongst
them
and
drove
them
away
and
then
another
cloud
was
seen
coming
across
the
sky
and
this
cloud
came
to
be
a
flock
of
birds
too
and
they
came
to
the
and
lighted
on
the
ground
linnets
finches
starlings
blackbirds
peewits
and
each
bird
was
bigger
than
the
birds
in
the
first
flock
loose
the
hound
on
them
said
little
fawn
ardan
unslipped
conbeg
and
the
hound
went
amongst
the
birds
but
they
were
not
afraid
and
they
attacked
the
hound
and
only
his
strength
and
courage
was
so
great
they
would
have
driven
him
off
the
they
rose
up
and
they
flew
away
and
as
they
did
another
flock
of
birds
came
towards
the
they
lighted
on
the
ground
peewits
blackbirds
starlings
finches
linnets
tremendous
birds
ardan
loosed
conbeg
on
them
then
with
beaks
open
and
claws
outstretched
they
flew
at
ardan
and
little
fawn
little
fawn
took
his
great
sword
in
hand
and
he
attacked
them
with
such
strength
that
the
great
birds
flew
off
all
flew
from
the
mountain
except
one
bird
he
was
a
blackbird
and
the
greatest
amongst
them
all
when
ardan
told
little
fawn
that
this
bird
was
left
alone
on
a
rock
the
big
man
told
him
to
unloose
conbeg
the
hound
dashed
at
the
blackbird
but
the
blackbird
flew
at
him
and
attacked
him
with
beak
and
claws
with
a
sweep
of
his
wing
he
threw
conbeg
on
the
ground
then
he
rose
up
in
the
air
and
flew
towards
ardan
and
little
fawn
you
will
escape
him
said
ardan
but
me
he
will
kill
as
he
has
killed
conbeg
put
the
into
my
hand
and
guide
my
aim
said
little
fawn
ardan
put
the
of
brass
into
the
big
man
hand
and
guided
his
aim
little
fawn
threw
the
and
the
blackbird
fell
down
on
the
ground
but
the
bird
was
not
killed
a
frightening
tale
a
frightening
tale
said
the

hen
that
was

murrish
the
was
in
the
kitchen
in
dashed
conbeg
the
hound
his
eyes
blazing
with
the
fierceness
of
the
chase
murrish
was
so
frightened
that
she
ran
to
the
door
and
coming
to
the
door
she
saw
little
fawn
with
a
net
on
his
shoulder
he
came
into
the
house
and
he
put
the
net
on
the
floor
and
he
showed
murrish
what
was
in
the
net
a
tremendous
bird
a
blackbird
that
was
as
big
in
one
quarter
as
the
quarter
of
mutton
she
had
on
the
table
and
when
the
net
was
laid
down
on
the
ground
the
blackbird
flew
up
and
he
carried
the
middle
of
the
roof
away
with
him
as
he
flew
through
it
and
he
tumbled
beams
and
rafters
down
upon
murrish
my
grandfather
saw
the
blackbird
flying
towards
the
mountain
that
is
called
and
my
grandfather
told
my
father
who
told
me
you
spoke
the
truth
when
you
said
that
you
saw
a
blackbird
as
big
in
one
quarter
as
the
quarter
of
mutton
i
gave
you
for
your
dinner
said
murrish
the
to
little
fawn
and
i
believe
you
when
you
say
you
saw
an
ivy
leaf
as
big
as
my
barley
loaf
and
a
rowan
berry
as
big
as
my
pat
of
butter
i
would
only
show
you
said
little
fawn
that
the
men
i
lived
amongst
had
truth
on
their
lips
as
they
had
strength
in
their
hands
and
courage
in
their
hearts
and
from
that
day
little
fawn
and
murrish
the
lived
in
peace
and
good
fellowship
and
ardan
and
conbeg
grew
up
together
and
became
famous
one
and
the
other

lived
happy
for
long
but
as
the
books
say
the
end
of
every
ship
is
drowning
the
end
of
every
kiln
is
burning
the
end
of
every
feast
is
wasting
the
end
of
every
laugh
is
sighing
and
if
they
were
here
once
they
are
here
no
more
and
if
they
are
not

are

i
was
known
through
all
the
kingdoms
that
are
for
my
beautiful
hair
my
long
beautiful
green
hair
something
was
in
me
that
made
me
want
to
dance
and
i
used
to
rise
up
through
the
water
and
dance
on
the
shore
of
the
island
that
is
called
hathony
mananaun
as
you
creatures
know
is
lord
of
the
sea
and
what
he
commands
in
the
has
to
be

mananaun
made
a
promise
to
a
king
of
an
and
the
promise
was
that
he
would
give
this
king
whatever
he
asked
for
the
king
died
according
to
the
ways
of
men
and
his
son
whose
name
was
branduv
came
to
rule
him
branduv
called
mananaun
out
of
the
sea
and
he
asked
that
he
renew
the
promise
he
had
made
to
his
father
the
lord
of
the
sea
did
not
want
a
promise
to
lapse
because
of
the
death
of
a
man
and
he
renewed
it
to
the
man
son
then
mananaun
told
him
he
would
take
him
and
show
him
the
kingdoms
of
the
sea
and
whatever
he
saw
that
he
desired
there
would
be
given
to
him
he
took
him
in
his
boat
of
glass
the
ocean
sweeper
to
visit
the
kingdoms
of
the
sea
they
came
to
moy
mell
the
plain
of
pleasure
and
there
mananaun
gave
branduv
a
branch
of
everlasting
blossoms
they
came
to
another
kingdom
and
there
mananaun
gave
him
a
sword
that
was
the
best
wrought
in
the
world
they
came
to
a
third
kingdom
and
there
mananaun
gave
him
a
pair
of
hounds
that
could
run
down
the
stag
but
as
yet
branduv
the
king
had
asked
no
gift
from
mananaun
they
came
to
mananaun
own
kingdom
plain
and
there
branduv
was
left
alone
while
mananaun
drank
the
ale
of
the
ones
the
king
saw
from
the
shores
of
plain
the
ocean
sweeper
and
he
directed
that
the
boat
bring
him
to
the
island
and
the
boat
travelled
as
the
one
in
it
wished
only
one
thing
had
ever
made
me
fearful
of
dancing
on
the
shore
of
the
island
of
hathony
that
was
the
presence
there
of
a
pair
of
ravens
these
ravens
had
once
been
but
they
had
desired
men
for
husbands
and
they
had
gone
to
them
the
men
forsook
them
and
they
had
become
first
witches
and
afterwards
ravens
ever
since
their
change
they
wished
harm
to
the
maidens
of
the
sea
i
had
been
frightened
of
them
but
now
i
had
seen
them
flapping
about
so
often
that
i
was
no
longer
or
i
was
only
a
little
afraid
i
came
up
through
the
sea
and
i
danced
upon
the
shore
of
the
island
and
the
play
of
the
waves
was
in
my
dance
and
my
long
soft
green
hair
fell
over
my
foam
soft
body
i
danced
on
o
my
listeners
and
as
no
one
had
ever
seen
me
looked
upon
i
thought
no
one
looked
upon
me
now
but
this
king
of
the
earthly
kingdom
saw
me
he
saw
me
as
i
danced
by
the
waves
and
i
was
the
fairest
thing
he
had
ever
looked
upon
at
first
he
was
all
wonder
and
no
robber
thoughts
were
in
his
mind
but
the
ravens
came
to
him
one
perched
on
one
shoulder
and
one
perched
on
the
other
and
one
said
if
you
carry
eevil
off
you
will
have
the
fairest
wife
in
all
the
world
and
the
other
said
if
you
leave
her
here
you
will
never
look
on
anything
as
fair
again
the
ravens
flapped
before
him
to
guide
him
to
a
place
in
the
dark
rocks
where
he
might
hide
and
to
which
i
might
come
he
followed
where
they
led
but
i
saw
his
shadow
on
a
rock
i
drew
back
and
the
sea
took
me
and
drew
me
into
its
depths
the
sea
has
taken
her
said
branduv
to
the
ravens
mananaun
is
lord
of
the
sea
said
one
of
the
ravens
and
mananaun
has
promised
you
a
gift
and
he
can
not
refuse
what
you
will
ask
said
the
other
raven
then
the
ravens
flapped
away
and
mananaun
came
to
where
the
king
was
standing
you
have
asked
me
for
a
gift
said
mananaun
think
now
of
what
you
desire
before
i
take
you
back
to
your
own
island
then
said
branduv
what
i
ask
is
that
you
bestow
upon
me
the
who
was
dancing
here
eevil
illustration
mananaun
in
anger
lifted
his
spear
but
then
he
remembered
he
was
bound
by
a
promise
to
branduv
he
lowered
the
spear
he
had
raised
i
will
give
you
any
other
gift
you
ask
said
he
even
my
own
boat
ocean
sweeper
i
hold
you
to
your
promise
said
branduv
and
i
declare
to
you
that
i
shall
take
no
other
gift
unless
it
be
the
maiden
who
was
here
dancing
by
the
sea
it
must
be
then
that
i
give
her
you
said
mananaun
and
his
face
was
dark
illustration
down
he
went
to
the
and
he
came
to
the
black
mansion
where
lived
the
seven
spinning
women
of
the
sea
he
spoke
as
speaks
a
king
who
has
a
hard
thing
to
do
a
law
has
to
be
broken
said
he
what
law
lord
said
the
spinning
women
the
law
that
saves
our
maidens
from
taking
part
in
the
stormy
lives
of
men
we
would
rather
that
anything
else
but
this
should
happen
lord
said
the
seven
spinning
women
this
thing
must
happen
said
mananaun
and
the
maiden
eevil
must
go
to
branduv
the
king
she
must
be
prepared
for
this
said
the
seven
spinning
women
they
came
to
me
and
they
told
me
that
the
man
whose
shadow
i
had
seen
on
the
rock
now
claimed
me
for
his
wife
and
that
mananaun
would
not
gainsay
him
when
i
heard
this
o
my
listeners
the
life
nearly
left
me
this
comfort
the
seven
spinning
women
gave
me
i
was
to
stay
on
his
island
so
that
i
might
become
used
to
the
earthly
kingdom
but
that
i
was
not
to
see
branduv
until
the
green
had
left
my
hair
and
the
brown
that
the
sun
makes
had
come
into
my
cheeks
so
i
came
to
island
i
lived
by
the
and
the
women
of
the
island
attended
me
how
different
was
this
earthly
land
from
the
with
us
there
was
but
the
one
mild
season
the
one
mild
light
here
there
was
glaring
day
and
terrible
darkness
bitter
winds
and
hot
beams
of
the
sun
with
us
there
were
songs
and
tales
but
the
songs
were
about
love
or
about
the
beautiful
things
we
had
seen
here
the
tales
and
songs
were
about
battles
and
forays
and
slaying
with
the
sword
what
they
told
of
their
loves
was
terrible
so
much
violence
and
unfaithfulness
was
in
them
the
soft
green
tints
were
going
out
of
my
hair
and
the
sun
was
putting
brownness
in
my
cheeks
soon
my
hair
would
be
like
the
hair
of
the
women
of
the
islands
and
my
cheeks
would
be
brown
like
theirs
and
then
the
day
would
come
when
i
should
have
to
be
with
the
man
whom
i
looked
upon
as
my
enemy
i
used
to
stay
by
the
shore
and
speak
with
the
birds
that
came
in
from
the
sea
for
i
knew
their
language
never
again
could
i
go
back
to
the
green
shade
after
green
shade
left
my
hair
brown
tint
after
brown
tint
came
into
my
cheeks
and
what
could
i
do
but
envy
the
birds
that
could
make
their
flight
from
the
islands
of
men
and
when
the
green
had
nearly
gone
altogether
from
my
hair
i
thought
of
a
desperate
thing
i
might
do
illustration
i
put
it
to
my
lips
i
drank
it
when
he
took
a
step
towards
me
i
sent
a
message
to
my
sisters
and
i
sent
it
by
many
birds
so
that
if
they
did
not
get
it
by
one
they
might
get
it
by
another
and
i
asked
in
my
message
that
they
send
me
a
draft
from
the
well
under
the
sea
and
that
they
send
it
in
the
cup
that
the
seven
spinning
women
guarded
it
would
be
terrible
for
any
of
my
sisters
to
come
to
branduv
island
with
the
draft
and
the
cup
but
i
begged
that
they
would
do
it
for
me
the
days
went
by
and
the
green
color
was
now
only
a
shade
in
my
hair
and
brownness
was
on
my
cheeks
and
the
women
said
before
this
old
moon
is
gone
our
king
will
come
here
to
wed
you
then
one
day
i
found
on
the
shore
the
cup
that
my
sisters
had
brought
and
the
draft
from
the
secret
well
was
in
it
i
took
the
cup
in
my
hands
and
i
brought
it
where
i
lived
come
to
us
said
the
women
so
that
we
may
undo
your
hair
and
tell
the
king
when
he
may
come
to
wed
you
they
loosened
my
hair
and
then
they
said
there
is
no
shade
of
green
here
at
all
bid
the
king
come
as
early
as
he
likes
i
lay
that
night
with
the
cup
beside
me
when
i
rose
i
knew
that
day
i
should
drink
from
the
cup
my
sisters
had
sent
me
drink
the
draft
that
would
change
me
into
what
i
wished
to
be
a
bird
of
the
sea
and
while
i
sat
with
the
cup
beside
me
and
my
hair
spread
out
branduv
the
king
of
the
island
came
to
the
door
of
the
house
it
may
have
been
that
i
was
becoming
used
to
the
sight
of
people
of
the
earthly
kingdoms
for
as
i
looked
upon
him
he
did
not
seem
terrible
to
me
he
looked
noble
i
thought
and
eager
to
befriend
me
and
love
me
but
the
cup
was
in
my
hands
when
he
came
to
the
door
i
put
it
to
my
lips
when
he
entered
the
house
i
drank
it
when
he
took
a
step
towards
me
and
thereupon
i
became
what
i
had
wished
to
be
a
o
my
listeners
maybe
it
would
have
been
well
for
me
if
i
had
wed
that
king
and
be
now
as
the
women
of
the
islands
for
now
as
i
fly
over
the
sea
the
king
look
comes
before
me
and
i
think
that
he
was
eager
to
befriend
me
and
eager
to
love
me
so
i
am
not
content
when
i
am
flying
over
the
sea
and
i
am
lonely
when
i
am
on
these
islands
for
i
am
now
a
swan
and
what
has
a
swan
to
do
with
the
lives
of
men
such
was
the
story
that
the
told
the
pigeons
of
the
rock
and
the
boy
who
knew
what
the
birds
said
heard
it
all
and
remembered
every
word
of
it
illustration
illustration
what
the
peacock
and
the
crow
told
each
other
what
the
peacock
and
the
crow
told
each
other
when
the
crow
came
to
steal
the
peacock
feathers
illustration
said
the
lapwing
crow
i
never
have
seen
such
a
one
as
you
such
a
one
as
you
for
stealing
eggs
said
the
crow
caw
caw
i
never
have
seen
such
a
one
myself
and
i
am
i
am
sure
longer
in
the
world
then
the
crow
flew
away
and
the
lapwing
went
on
complaining
the
crow
flew
away
and
he
came
to
where
the
peacock
was
walking
in
the
king
garden
he
asked
the
peacock
did
he
ever
listen
to
stories
no
said
the
peacock
as
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
terrace
no
certainly
not
i
do
not
demean
myself
by
listening
to
any
of
the
stories
they
tell
down
below
there
he
spread
out
his
tail
and
that
he
might
view
his
own
magnificence
he
turned
his
blue
shining
neck
hoodie
the
crow
with
the
bright
sharp
eyes
hopped
after
him
jewels
kings
magicians
palaces
dragons
what
do
geese
grouse
and
farmyard
fowl
know
of
such
things
and
yet
they
presume
to
tell
stories
tell
stories
that
have
nothing
in
them
of
jewels
kings
magicians
palaces
or
dragons
nothing
at
all
about
such
things
said
hoodie
the
crow
as
he
plucked
a
feather
out
of
the
peacock
tail
yet
they
will
not
listen
to
me
said
purpurpurati
the
peacock
they
affect
even
to
scorn
my
voice
they
pretend
that
it
is
less
resonant
than
the
cock
in
the
farmyard
and
less
musical
than
the
bird
that
sings
at
night
they
say
anything
said
hoodie
the
crow
keeping
behind
the
peacock
tail
purpurpurati
the
peacock
mounted
higher
on
the
terrace
i
shall
walk
before
the
statue
of
the
beautiful
queen
yonder
he
said
and
i
shall
tell
you
a
story
the
reason
that
i
shall
tell
you
is
that
the
queen
always
listens
to
me
but
i
would
have
her
think
that
it
is
to
you
that
i
am
telling
the
story
i
listen
to
you
said
hoodie
the
crow
and
he
plucked
another
feather
out
of
the
peacock
tail
when
the
queen
has
been
pleased
with
the
sight
of
my
tail
i
shall
begin
said
purpurpurati
and
he
spread
out
his
tail
hoodie
the
crow
plucked
out
three
feathers
how
pleased
she
looks
said
he
yes
she
is
always
pleased
by
my
appearance
the
peacock
said
and
he
turned
round
and
walked
the
other
way
did
i
ever
tell
you

how
the

went
to

crow
to

about
such
things

said

the
crow
illustration
the
crow
is
the
among
the
birds
and
so
it
was
to
the
crow
that
the
pigeon
went
to
learn
the
art
of
we
begin
with
the
sticks
said
the
crow
i
know
said
the
pigeon
first
we
take
one
stick
and
lay
it
lengthwise
i
know
said
the
pigeon
then
we
put
a
stick
across
it
said
the
crow
i
know
said
the
pigeon
and
then
we
put
another
stick
lower
down
said
the
crow
i
know
said
the
pigeon
then
we
put
another
stick
lengthwise
i
know
said
the
pigeon
musha
said
the
crow
if
you
know
so
much
why
do
you
come
here
at
all
away
with
you
fly
home
now
and
build
the
nest
yourself
the
pigeon
flew
home
but
of
course
he
was
not
able
to
build
his
nest
for
he
knew
nothing
about
the
laying
of
sticks
and
the
bringing
of
straws
and
he
was
too
young
and
foolish
to
learn
when
he
got
the
chance
and
that
is
why
the
pigeon
to
this
day
can
not
build
a
nest

why
do
you
tell
such
foolish
stories
said

the

lived
in
a
palace
of
red
marble
that
was
all
surrounded
by
a
forest
of
black
black
trees
i
lived
there
too
and
i
ate
golden
grains
out
of
pails
of
silver
that
was
long
ago
and
it
was
in
far
india
the
magician
had
precious
stones
of
every
kind
and
he
would
have
me
walk
beside
him
to
the
cavern
where
he
kept
his
precious
stones
and
as
he
handled
them
over
he
would
tell
me
of
the
virtues
that
each
stone
possessed
and
one
day
the
magician
looking
upon
me
said
peacock
i
will
slay
for
the
beauty
of
his
neck
makes
dull
my
turquoises
and

said
hoodie
the
crow
hearing
him
say
this
said
the
peacock
i
flew
into
the
branches
of
a
dark
dark
tree
and
as
i
rested
there
the
fair
lady
who
walked
about
the
garden
she
was
called
and
she
was
the
daughter
walked
under
the
dark
dark
trees
and
i
saw
that
she
was
weeping
i
knew
why
she
wept
she
wept
for
the
young
man
whom
her
father
had
imprisoned
in
a
tower
this
young
man
was
the
son
of
a
king
and
the
magician
was
his
father
brother
and
if
the
young
man
died
the
magician
would
become
king
in
his
brother
kingdom
but
the
lady
did
not
want
the
young
man
to
die
a
little
dove
flew
down
from
the
tower
and
spoke
in
words
to
and
asked
her
what
word
she
had
to
send
to
the
young
man
must
tell
him
terrible
news
my
little
snow
white
dove
said
father
will
have
him
go
forth
to
fight
with
a
dragon
and
this
is
a
terrible
dragon
every
young
man
who
has
gone
forth
against
him
has
been
slain
illustration
o
most
beauteous
of
all
the
birds
do
you
know
of
any
arms
by
which
a
hero
can
slay
a
dragon
the
little
snow
white
dove
flew
back
to
the
tower
and
the
princess
stood
under
the
dark
dark
trees
and
wept
again
and
when
she
saw
me
on
my
branch
she
said
most
beauteous
of
all
the
birds
do
you
know
of
any
arms
by
which
a

can
slay
a

then
i
came
down
off
my
branch
and
i
walked
beside
the
princess
and
as
i
walked
beside
her
i
told
her
the
wonderful

the
peacock
but

had
learnt
from
the
magician
when
he
spoke
of
the
virtues
of
his
precious
stones
a
ruby
in
a
helmet
would
make
a
dragon
eyes
go
blind
a
turquoise
on
his
arm
would
make
a
dragon
blood
turn
to
water
a
sapphire
on
his
spear
would
make
a
dragon
heart
burst
within
him
so

heart
burst
within
him
and
the

to
sit
on
the
branch
that
went
furthest
across
the
stream
with
his
head
bent
down
and
looking
as
if
he
were
trying
to
think
his
head
off
only
in
the
most
lonesome
places
far
from
where
the

cackled

that
built
in

lone
tree
he
came
where
sat
upon
the
slenderest
branch
that
went
farthest
across
the
stream
and
when
saw
him
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
he
fixed
his
eye
upon
him
and
he
cried
out
the
one
word
follow
then
he
went
flying
down
the
stream
as
if
he
were
not
a
bird
at
all
but
a
streak
of
blue
fire
went
flying
along
the
stream
and
the
boy
who
knew
what
the
birds
said
was
able
to
follow
him
they
went
on
until
the
stream
they
followed
came
out
on
the
sand
of
the
then
seated
himself
on
a
branch
that
was
just
above
where
the
grains
of
sand
and
the
blades
of
grass
mixed
with
each
other
and
he
fixed
his
eye
on
a
mound
of
sand
and
clay
and
when
the
boy
who
knew
what
the
birds
said
came
beside
him
said
the
one
word
find
then
the
boy
who
knew
what
the
birds
said
began
to
take
the
sand
and
clay
from
the
mound
he
worked
all
day
at
it
and
sat
on
the
branch
above
and
watched
him
and
at
evening
when
all
the
sand
and
clay
had
been
taken
away
by
him
the
boy
who
knew
what
the
birds
said
came
upon
a
stone
that
was
as
big
and
as
round
as
the
wheel
of
a
cart
and
when
he
had
brushed
away
the
grains
of
sand
that
was
on
the
round
stone
he
saw
a
writing
the
writing
was
in
ogham
but
at
that
time
even
boys
could
read
ogham
and
the
ogham
writing
said
you
have
luck
to
have
seen
this
side
of
the
stone
but
you
will
have
more
luck
when
you
see
the
other
side
when
he
read
that
he
looked
up
to
where
the
bird
sat
but
only
said
i
am
done
with
you
now
and
then
he
flew
back
along
the
stream
like
a
streak
of
blue
fire
the
boy
who
knew
what
the
birds
said
stayed
near
the
stone
until
the
dark
was
coming
on
then
he
thought
he
would
go
home
and
in
the
morning
he
would
speak
to
pracaun

ask

to

what
good
luck
there

came
to
the
standing
stone
in
the
morning
and
ate
the
boiled
potato
that
the
boy
who
knew
what
the
birds
said
brought
her
and
then
the
boy
spoke
to
her
about

stone
that

to

asked
what

there
was
at

mananaun
who
is
lord
of
the

had
given
him
the

or
rather
he
had
given
him
the
two
keys
that
had
brought
the
islands
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
two
silver
keys
they
were
o
lad
and
when
they
were
brought
together
they
struck
each
other
and
rang
like
bells
and
lorc
is
king
king
of
the
two
fair
islands
is
what
they
chimed
out
as
long
as
he
held
the
keys
the
islands
would
remain
above
the
water
but
if
he
put
the
keys
away
the
islands
would
sink
back
into
the
sea
once
in
every
month
the
king
had
a
man
killed
this
is
how
it
was
he
would
have
a
man
to
shave
his
beard
and
to
trim
his
hair
this
man
never
came
alive
out
of
the
king
castle
as
soon
as
the
poor
barber
left
the
king
chamber
and
passed
down
the
hall
soldiers
would
fall
upon
him
and
kill
him
with
their
swords
every
time
when
the
beard
was
shaved
and
his
hair
was
trimmed
a
man
was
killed
twelve
men
in
a
year
a
hundred
and
men
in
twelve
years
now
a
warning
came
to
a
woman
that
her
son
would
be
called
upon
to
be
the
next
barber
to
the
king
she
was
a
widow
and
the
young
man
was
her
only
son
she
was
wild
with
grief
when
she
thought
that
he
would
be
killed
by
the
soldiers
swords
as
soon
as
he
had
shaved
the
beard
and
trimmed
the
king
hair
she
went
everywhere
the
king
rode
she
threw
herself
before
him
and
asked
for
the
life
of
her
son
and
at
last
the
king
promised
that
no
harm
would
befall
her
son
life
if
he
swore
he
would
tell
no
person
what
he
saw
when
he
shaved
the
king
beard
and
trimmed
the
hair
after
that
he
would
be
always
the
king
barber
the
widow
son
came
before
the
king
and
he
swore
he
would
tell
no
person
what
he
saw
when
he
shaved
his
beard
and
trimmed
his
hair
then
he
went
into
the
king
chamber
and
when
he
came
out
from
it
the
king
soldiers
did
not
fall
upon
him
and
kill
him
with
their
swords
the
widow
son
went
home
out
of
the
castle
his
mother
cried
over
him
with
joy
at
seeing
him
back
the
next
day
he
went
to
work
at
his
trade
and
his
mother
watched
him
and
was
contented
in
her
mind
but
the
day
after
her
son
only
worked
by
fits
and
starts
and
the
day
after
that
he
did
no
work
at
all
but
sat
over
the
fire
looking
into
the
burning
coals
and
after
that
the
widow
son
became
sick
and
lay
on
his
bed
and
no
one
could
tell
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
became
more
and
more
ill
and
at
last
his
mother
thought
that
he
had
only
escaped
the
soldiers
swords
to
come
home
and
die
in
his
house
and
when
she
thought
of
that
she
said
to
herself
that
she
would
go
see
the
druid
who
lived
at
the
back
of
the
hill
and
beg
him
to
come
to
see
her
son
and
strive
to
cure
him
the
druid
came
and
he
looked
into
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
and
he
said
has
a
secret
upon
his
mind
and
if
he
does
not
tell
it
he
will
die
then
his
mother
told
the
druid
that
he
had
sworn
not
to
tell
any
person
what
he
saw
when
he
shaved
the
king
beard
and
trimmed
the
king
hair
and
that
what
he
saw
was
his
secret
said
the
druid
he
wants
to
live
he
will
have
to
speak
out
his
secret
but
it
need
not
be
to
any
person
let
him
go
to
the
meeting
of
two
roads
turn
with
the
sun
and
tell
his
secret
to
the
first
tree
on
his
right
hand
and
when
he
feels
he
has
told
his
secret
your
son
will
get
the
better
of
his
sickness
illustration
when
this
was
told
to
the
young
man
he
got
up
off
his
bed
and
he
walked
to
where
two
roads
met
he
turned
as
the
sun
turns
and
he
whispered
into
the
branches
of
the
first
tree
on
his
right
hand
and
the
secret
that
he
whispered
was
labraid
lorc
has
the
ears
of
a
horse
then
he
turned
from
the
tree
and
he
went
home
he
slept
and
in
the
morning
when
he
woke
he
was
well
and
he
went
to
his
work
and
he
was
happy
and
cheerful
but
the
tree
that
he
whispered
his
secret
to
was
a
willow
and
as
you
know
out
of
the
branches
of
the
willow
the
harp
is
made
as
the
widow
son
went
away
a
harper
seeking
wood
to
make
a
new
harp
came
that
way
he
saw
the
willow
and
he
knew
that
its
branches
were
just
right
for
the
making
of
his
harp
he
cut
them
and
he
bent
them
and
he
formed
a
harp
from
them
and
when
the
harp
was
firmly
fixed
the
harper
came
with
it
to
the
king
castle
the
king
gave
a
feast
so
that
the
first
music
that
came
from
the
harp
should
be
honored
he
made
the
harper
sit
near
his
own
high
chair
then
when
the
feast
was
at
its
height
he
called
upon
the
harper
to
stand
up
and
strike
the
first
music
from
the
new
harp
first
music
from
the
new
harp
shall
be
praise
of
the
king
said
the
harper
when
he
stood
up
he
drew
his
fingers
across
the
strings
and
all
listened
for
the
first
music
that
would
come
but
the
harp
that
was
made
out
of
the
willow
branches
that

lorc
has
the
ears

the
king
started
up
from
his
high
chair
the
harper
threw
down
the
harp
everyone
was
silent
in
the
hall
then
one
voice
was
heard
saying
is
true
the
king
labraid
lorc
has
the
ears
of
a
horse
the
king
had
the
man
who
said
it
taken
by
his
soldiers
and
flung
from
the
top
of
the
castle
no
one
else
spoke
but
the
next
day
when
he
rode
abroad
the
king
heard
the
people
behind
the
hedges
saying
lorc
has
the
ears
of
a
horse
after
that
whenever
he
came
near
them
people
went
from
him
and
at
last
no
one
was
left
in
his
castle
and
there
was
no
one
to
take
him
over
to
the
fair
islands
that
mananaun
lord
of
the
sea
had
given
him
for
a
possession
and
there
was
no
one
to
bring
over
the
fruits
that
grew
on
the
islands
nor
the
cattle
and
sheep
that
pastured
there
then
the
king
went
to
mananaun
lord
of
the
sea
and
he
offered
him
back
the
keys
mananaun
had
given
him
the
silver
keys
that
struck
each
other
when
they
were
brought
together
and
rang
like
bells
chiming
out
lorc

king
of

but
no
gift
that
mananaun
gives
is
ever
taken
back
and
the
keys
were
still
left
with
labraid
lorc
yet
he
thought
he
would
let
the
keys
go
out
of
his
possession
so
that
the
fair
islands
would
sink
back
into
the
sea
but
that
they
might
not
stay
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
ever
he
took
the
keys
and
he
put
them
in
a
pit
at
the
and
he
covered
the
pit
with
a
round
stone
and
knowing
that
it
would
be
only
a
lucky
person
who
would
come
to
that
stone
he
wrote
in

on
it
you

you
will
have
more
luck
when
you
see
the

as
he
left
the
silver
keys
there
the
fair
islands
began
to
sink
in
the
water
so
slow
were
they
in
sinking
that
the
cattle
and
sheep
that
pastured
on
the
islands
were
taken
off
in
boats
and
the
people
who
lived
in
villages
on
the
islands
came
away
with
all
they
owned
but
at
last
the
islands
sank
altogether
out
of
sight
and
after
they
went
down
into
the
sea
king
labraid
lorc
was
seen
no
more
and
you
o
boy
are
the
lucky
one
that
the
king
hid
the
silver
keys
for
when
you
take
them
into
your
hands
the
islands
will
begin
to
rise
above
the
water
and
when
they
are
altogether
risen
and
are
called
the
fair
islands
again
you
will
be
lord
of
them
and
the
one
we
thought
had
no
care
but
for
himself
brought
you
to
this
good
fortune
day
after
day
the
boy
who
knew
what
the
birds
said
went
down
to
the
and
worked
to
lift
up
the
round
stone
that
was
over
the
pit
in
which
king
labraid
lorc
had
put
his
silver
keys
and
one
day
he
was
able
to
raise
up
the
stone
there
lay
the
great
keys
shining
in
their
silver
brightness
he
took
them
up
and
when
he
brought
them
near
each
other
they
struck
together
and
they
rang
like
bells
mananaun
was
the
the
name
they
chimed
out
and
they
chimed
again

looking

the

ernan
saw
waters
rising
up

though

and
the
next
day
when
he
came
to

he
saw
that

had
risen
and
that
they
were
already
covered
with
green
no

he
listened
to
what
the
birds
said
but
he
watched
the
islands
every
day
and
he
saw
trees
and
grass
come
upon
them
and
when
the
people
came
and
said
who
can
be
lord
of
these
islands
he
held
up
the
silver
keys
and
brought
them
together
so
that
they
struck
each

and
rang
like
bells

what
they
chimed
out
each
