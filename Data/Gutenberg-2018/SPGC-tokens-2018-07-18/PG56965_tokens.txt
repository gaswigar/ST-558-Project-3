he
said
my
lovely
fragrant
flower
good
old
jane
she
said
i
do
enjoy
talking
to
you
you
are
not
much
use
at
answering
questions
darling
are
you
oh
flower
cared
like
this
the
wheels
of
time
the
doctor
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
doorknob
and
gave
a
final
look
back
into
his
wife
boudoir
there
was
nothing
in
that
room
suggestive
of
town
or
of
town
life
and
work
delicate
green
and
white
a
mossy
carpet
masses
of
spring
flowers
cool
soft
noiseless
fragrant
standing
in
the
doorway
the
doctor
could
hear
the
agitated
clang
of
the
bell
stoddart
crossing
the
hall
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
door
and
stoddart
subdued
and
sympathetic
voice
saying
step
this
way
please
a
heavy
depressed
foot
or
an
anxious
hurried
one
according
to
the
mental
condition
of
its
owner
obeyed
and
the
shutting
of
the
library
door
meant
another
patient
added
to
the
number
of
those
who
were
already
listlessly
turning
over
the
pages
of
bound
volumes
of
or
scrutinizing
with
unseeing
eyes
the
landseer
engraving
over
the
mantelpiece
in
former
days
the
used
to
be
the
doctor
but
before
he
married
his
pretty
wife
she
put
her
foot
down
firmly
on
this
question
he
had
been
explaining
the
wimpole
street
house
and
its
arrangements
as
they
stood
together
in
her
sunny
but
deryck
she
had
exclaimed
in
dismay
waving
her
hands
at
him
full
of
a
great
mass
of
freshly
gathered
roses
i
could
not
sit
down
and
dine
with
you
in
a
room
where
your
horrible
patients
have
sat
waiting
for
hours
leaving
behind
them
the
germs
of
all
their
nasty
infectious
diseases
the
doctor
caught
the
little
hands
roses
and
all
and
held
them
against
his
breast
looking
down
into
her
face
with
laughing
eyes
flower
he
said
my
lovely
fragrant
flower
am
i
doing
a
foolish
thing
in
attempting
to
transplant
you
into
the
soil
of
busy
london
life
should
i
not
do
better
if
i
left
you
in
your
ah
well
it
is
too
late
to
ask
that
now
i
ca
leave
wimpole
street
and
his
voice
always
deep
suddenly
thrilled
to
a
deeper
depth
a
tenderness
of
strong
passion
quivered
in
it
i
ca
live
without
you
he
let
go
her
hands
and
framed
her
upturned
face
in
his
strong
brown
fingers
what
have
you
done
to
me
flower
i
was
always
and
and
now
i
find
i
ca
live
without
you
flower
flower
his
eyes
glowed
down
into
her
face
she
looked
up
sweetly
at
him
but
deryck
she
said
they
leave
the
germs
of
all
their
nasty
infectious
the
doctor
hands
fell
suddenly
to
his
sides
my
dear
child
he
said
and
his
voice
instantly
regained
its
usual
evenness
of
tone
have
i
not
told
you
that
i
am
a
mind
specialist
the
people
who
come
to
my
are
not
as
a
rule
suffering
from
measles
scarlet
fever
or
smallpox
oh
well
they
leave
their
dreadful
morbid
thoughts
behind
them
and
that
is
worse
i
could
not
dine
in
a
room
where
diseased
minds
have
sat
for
hours
brooding
it
would
give
me
creeps
and
oh
deryck
you
know
that
stupid
article
you
read
me
the
other
day
about
how
mental
impressions
when
a
mind
was
highly
strung
or
unbalanced
could
leave
an
impress
upon
walls
or
furniture
explaining
ghost
stories
you
know
i
forget
who
wrote
it
you
did
my
dear
boy
how
clever
of
you
oh
no
how
can
you
say
i
called
it
or
if
i
did
i
meant
of
course
see
how
well
i
remembered
it
though
you
thought
i
was
not
listening
because
i
had
to
keep
counting
the
stitches
in
the
heels
of
your
golf
stockings
you
ungrateful
man
and
i
am
certain
you
are
right
about
horrible
thoughts
sticking
to
furniture
and
however
well
stoddart
arranged
the
room
he
could
sweep
them
away
and
we
should
sit
at
dinner
surrounded
by
them
oh
deryck
her
lovely
eyes
looked
widely
at
him
over
the
gathered
roses
the
doctor
laughed
it
is
so
easy
for
a
man
to
laugh
before
marriage
all
right
flower
he
said
there
is
nothing
like
convincing
a
fellow
with
his
own
arguments
we
will
remodel
the
house
i
talk
it
over
with
hunt
you
shall
have
and
boudoir
all
on
the
first
floor
and
i
and
my
freaks
will
have
the
run
of
the
ground
floor
you
will
need
only
to
pass
through
the
hall
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
house
so
if
they
drop
their
poor
minds
about
you
will
not
come
across
them
now
choose
me
that
promised
and
then
let
us
come
down
to
the
stream
i
do
like
a
when
half
of
the
windows
of
the
house
overlook
it
this
was
seven
years
ago
and
it
now
sometimes
seemed
to
dr
brand
as
if
his
tall
wimpole
street
house
represented
in
its
stories
the
various
portions
of
the
human
anatomy
absolutely
distinct
in
themselves
but
held
together
and
kept
going
by
the
brain
the
brain
controlling
all
his
wife
apartments
on
the
first
floor
his
life
with
her
there
into
which
his
professional
interests
were
so
rarely
allowed
to
intrude
certainly
they
represented
the
of
things
the
man
whole
heart
rested
and
centred
there
the
floor
above
was
given
up
to
the
nurseries
and
there
already
two
pairs
of
little
feet
pattered
ceaselessly
and
merry
voices
shouted
clear
and
gleeful
and
a
little
girl
peeped
down
at
him
through
the
balustrade
and
a
small
boy
gazing
earnestly
with
dark
steadfast
eyes
into
the
interior
of
a
jumping
rabbit
which
refused
to
jump
reproduced
absurdly
his
own
intent
professional
manner
in
the
basement
were
the
kitchens
and
he
was
as
ignorant
of
them
as
he
reflected
with
a
smile
every
perfectly
healthy
man
should
be
of
the
digestive
organs
of
his
own
anatomy
then
on
the
ground
floor
between
the
life
and
the
life
above
but
generating
the
needful
supplies
to
keep
the
whole
establishment
going
dwelt
the
brain
brain
his
untiring
capacity
for
hard
work
represented
by
his
where
so
many
strenuous
hours
were
spent
and
the
old
now
called
the
library
where
an
number
of
patients
waited
daily
this
floor
of
his
life
was
practically
unshared
by
any
excepting
the
faithful
and
punctilious
old
butler
whose
monotonous
step
this
way
sir
please
to
step
this
way
served
to
punctuate
the
departure
of
one
case
and
the
arrival
of
the
next
sometimes
the
desire
to
share
the
interest
of
this
daily
work
with
another
gripped
him
in
the
throes
of
its
human
necessity
when
his
deep
penetrating
eyes
had
been
long
bent
upon
the
shifting
shuffling
mind
of
a
patient
at
last
piercing
with
tender
mercilessness
to
the
very
core
of
that
mind
malady
when
his
quick
brain
had
grasped
the
case
in
all
its
bearings
and
his
magnificent
had
compelled
the
shaken
soul
to
see
things
as
he
saw
them
to
believe
things
as
he
believed
them
to
face
the
future
as
the
future
alone
could
rightly
be
faced
when
his
inspiring
enthusiasm
and
belief
in
god
and
life
and
human
nature
had
set
that
mental
cripple
on
his
feet
or
loosed
the
bands
which
had
bound
some
poor
daughter
of
abraham
lo
these
eighteen
years
when
conducted
by
stoddart
mechanical
step
this
way
they
passed
out
from
his
to
tread
with
new
hopes
the
path
of
a
new
life
he
would
stride
to
his
window
squaring
his
shoulders
and
taking
in
a
deep
breath
of
fresh
air
he
would
say
god
what
a
victory
i
must
tell
flower
but
once
in
flower
boudoir
with
a
dainty
china
teacup
in
his
hand
and
a
muffin
on
his
knee
hearing
the
blissful
details
of
new
syllable
or
dicky
latest
development
or
flower
own
triumphal
progress
through
the
park
in
the
new
somehow
the
story
of
the
strenuous
fight
the
hopeful
victory
seemed
out
of
place
this
was
the
home
of
must
not
intrude
this
was
the
domain
of
trivialities
the
great
issues
of
life
must
hide
in
the
background
this
was
the
home
of
the
heart
the
brain
must
abide
below
yet
matrimony
and
motherhood
had
done
much
to
deepen
flower
the
linking
with
his
nature
the
having
perforce
to
awaken
in
order
to
meet
and
satisfy
the
deep
needs
of
his
overmastering
love
the
constant
example
of
his
unselfish
nobility
singleness
of
purpose
and
high
ideal
of
life
and
above
all
the
pangs
and
joys
of
motherhood
all
these
had
made
of
the
wilful
wayward
little
flower
of
the
a
sweet
and
gracious
woman
in
outward
face
and
form
more
exquisite
than
ever
and
in
the
hidden
part
an
awakening
soul
which
needed
only
an
hour
of
deep
agony
a
tearing
away
of
the
flimsy
veil
of
selfishness
and
conventionality
now
stifling
it
to
bring
it
to
the
birth
but
that
time
of
pain
and
stress
came
not
to
flower
because
the
strong
shielding
love
of
a
man
was
always
around
her
and
his
care
warded
off
the
very
thing
which
alone
could
have
brought
about
his
comfort
and
her
completion
and
yet
he
was
dimly
conscious
of
a
gradual
growth
in
her
and
sometimes
half
wistfully
he
called
her
mary
that
name
so
sacred
to
perfect
motherhood
and
which
had
seemed
such
an
incongruous
gift
from
her
sponsors
to
his
flower
of
the
on
this
particular
morning
when
the
doctor
stood
at
the
door
looking
into
the
boudoir
flower
was
bending
over
a
huge
bowl
of
daffodils
arranging
each
golden
trumpet
to
her
liking
the
spring
sunshine
came
glancing
through
the
window
and
touched
her
hair
to
the
gold
of
the
blossoms
the
doctor
noted
this
and
a
sudden
look
of
adoration
softened
the
cool
clearness
of
his
eyes
the
baby
godmother
on
this
last
day
of
her
visit
sitting
by
the
fire
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
opening
and
smoothing
a
copy
of
the
glanced
up
past
the
sunshine
and
the
daffodils
saw
that
look
and
promptly
retired
behind
a
leading
article
the
baby
godmother
was
a
perfectly
beautiful
woman
in
an
absolutely
plain
shell
but
unfortunately
no
man
had
yet
looked
beneath
the
shell
and
seen
the
woman
herself
in
her
perfection
she
would
have
made
earth
heaven
for
a
blind
lover
who
not
having
eyes
for
the
plainness
of
her
face
or
the
massiveness
of
her
figure
might
have
drawn
nearer
and
apprehended
the
wonder
of
her
as
a
woman
experiencing
the
wealth
of
tenderness
of
which
she
was
capable
the
blessed
comfort
of
the
shelter
of
her
love
the
perfect
comprehension
of
her
sympathy
the
marvellous
joy
of
winning
and
wedding
her
but
as
yet
no
blind
man
with
vision
had
come
her
way
and
it
always
seemed
to
be
her
lot
to
take
a
second
place
on
occasions
when
she
would
have
filled
the
first
to
infinite
perfection
she
had
been
bridesmaid
at
the
doctor
wedding
to
whom
she
would
have
made
a
wife
such
as
flower
develop
as
she
might
could
never
be
she
was
godmother
to
the
baby
she
whose
arms
ached
for
motherhood
itself
and
whose
motherliness
would
have
been
a
thing
for
men
to
kneel
down
and
worship
she
found
her
duties
as
godmother
to
various
babies
consisted
chiefly
in
praying
that
the
foolish
mistakes
made
by
their
parents
might
be
overruled
by
an
providence
and
work
out
somehow
to
their
ultimate
good
she
had
a
glorious
voice
but
her
face
not
matching
it
its
existence
was
rarely
suspected
and
as
she
accompanied
to
perfection
she
was
usually
in
requisition
to
play
for
the
singing
of
others
only
once
at
a
concert
where
the
principal
songstress
failed
at
the
last
moment
she
volunteered
to
fill
the
empty
place
and
walked
to
the
piano
when
the
moment
came
in
the
double
capacity
of
singer
and
accompanist
how
she
brought
down
the
house
on
this
occasion
and
how
a
blind
eyes
were
opened
belongs
to
another
story
meanwhile
she
was
a
woman
of
tact
and
when
she
perceived
how
the
doctor
was
momentarily
dazzled
by
the
sunlight
and
the
gold
she
retired
obviously
behind
the
leader
darling
said
the
doctor
i
am
wired
for
to
brighton
in
consultation
over
a
very
important
case
i
must
go
down
by
an
afternoon
train
and
i
doubt
if
i
can
get
back
how
tiresome
deryck
it
is
myra
reception
this
evening
and
i
promised
to
bring
you
with
me
i
shall
hate
going
alone
however
i
suppose
it
can
not
be
helped
did
you
ever
see
such
daffodils
it
makes
one
long
to
be
back
in
the
woods
at
home
the
doctor
hesitated
downstairs
the
bell
rang
again
the
hall
door
opened
and
closed
stoddart
said
step
this
way
sir
flower
said
the
doctor
i
have
a
jolly
little
plan
for
i
want
you
to
come
to
brighton
with
me
we
will
put
up
at
the
metropole
and
have
a
real
good
time
i
ought
to
be
able
to
get
back
to
you
there
soon
after
seven
and
we
can
have
dinner
and
go
on
the
pier
afterwards
and
watch
the
moonlight
on
the
sea
or
if
you
prefer
something
more
lively
there
is
a
good
concert
on
in
the
dome
i
will
telephone
for
seats
it
is
a
long
while
since
we
heard
any
music
together
he
stopped
rather
breathlessly
the
front
doorbell
rang
again
the
doctor
wife
took
out
a
daffodil
and
replaced
it
to
better
advantage
then
she
looked
up
with
an
exquisite
smile
dearest
you
are
so
amusing
with
your
sudden
plans
it
sounds
delightful
of
course
i
love
brighton
in
spring
i
shall
never
forget
driving
along
the
king
road
in
the
sunshine
with
a
huge
bunch
of
violets
on
my
muff
it
was
too
heavenly
early
march
and
the
whole
place
seemed
to
sing
of
how
summer
was
coming
but
we
can
not
always
do
what
we
like
i
look
in
at
myra
party
and
i
should
really
have
thought
you
might
have
got
back
in
time
if
you
appeared
at
eleven
it
would
do
the
doctor
face
against
the
pale
green
woodwork
of
the
door
suddenly
looked
rather
worn
and
thin
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
get
back
flower
he
said
i
may
have
to
put
in
a
second
visit
in
the
morning
and
darling
i
want
you
this
case
will
be
rather
a
strain
it
will
be
just
everything
to
have
you
down
there
to
come
back
to
the
moment
it
is
over
i
shall
remember
you
are
waiting
for
me
the
baby
godmother
looked
up
quietly
over
the
she
had
heard
the
tone
in
his
voice
and
she
saw
on
his
face
just
what
she
expected
to
see
notwithstanding
his
forty
years
despite
his
brilliant
powers
his
ceaseless
energy
he
looked
at
that
minute
like
a
tired
child
just
needing
to
be
gathered
into
a
loving
woman
arms
and
hushed
to
rest
he
was
facing
beforehand
what
he
would
be
feeling
after
the
strain
was
over
he
was
yearning
for
the
love
and
companionship
dreading
the
solitude
and
loneliness
the
baby
godmother
knew
exactly
what
he
needed
she
awaited
flower
reply
who
is
case
deryck
the
doctor
hesitated
an
instant
then
named
a
name
so
widely
known
that
the
baby
godmother
bounded
in
her
chair
my
dear
deryck
she
cried
if
you
are
successful
there
it
means
fame
world
wide
oh
what
can
we
do
to
help
must
you
see
patients
this
morning
the
doctor
smiled
i
must
jeanette
unless
you
will
see
them
for
me
but
work
fits
me
for
work
it
is
only
after
it
is
all
over
one
feels
a
bit
tired
sometimes
he
looked
at
flower
well
sweet
can
you
be
ready
at
two
sharp
dear
she
said
i
am
sorry
but
i
ca
see
my
way
clear
about
going
with
you
if
only
it
had
been
nurse
has
asked
to
go
out
to
tea
and

the
children

longer
than
usual
of
course
there
emma
and
marsdon
could
help
but
i
should
not
feel
easy
about
it
and
i
promised
dicky
and
blossom
we
would
have
all
the
stuffed
animals
out
and
play
menagerie
i
never
feel
it
right
to
disappoint
little
children
and
you
know
you
often
say
to
me
yourself
you
have
promised
them
a
thing
keep
to
it
at
all
costs
besides
there
myra
tiresome
home
to
consider
really
deryck
i
do
see
how
i
can
be
away
today
all
right
flower
the
doctor
said
quietly
i
am
sorry
i
bothered
you
by
proposing
it
do
expect
me
up
to
lunch
every
moment
will
be
full
this
morning
stoddart
will
put
some
sandwiches
in
my
bag
the
door
closed
behind
him
they
heard
his
quick
step
on
the
stairs
and
the
door
shut
sharply
the
baby
godmother
laid
down
the
folded
her
skirt
back
over
her
knees
and
stirred
the
fire
with
her
shoe
flower
sighed
deryck
really
trying
she
said
the
baby
godmother
bit
her
lip
she
had
found
that
she
could
help
the
doctor
wife
best
by
never
contradicting
her
very
clever
people
usually
are
trying
she
remarked
after
a
pause
to
those
who
have
to
live
with
them
flower
wheeled
round
and
looked
at
her
my
good
jane
i
do
know
what
you
mean
deryck
is
perfect
to
live
with
have
you
stayed
here
ten
days
without
finding
that
out
he
is
only
trying
when
he
swoops
down
upon
me
with
a
sudden
plan
and
expects
me
to
be
ready
to
rush
away
with
him
at
a
moment
notice
if
he
had
let
me
know
yesterday
it
might
have
been
managed
i
gathered
he
only
knew
himself
this
morning
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
the
crux
of
the
whole
matter
is
that
had
promised
she
should
have
the
evening
and
i
can
not
leave
the
children
with
nurse
away
the
baby
godmother
bent
over
the
grate
took
up
the
poker
and
carefully
built
a
little
castle
of
molten
coal
in
the
very
heart
of
the
bright
fire
her
hands
looked
strong
and
firm
and
very
capable
her
face
flushed
as
she
bent
over
the
glowing
flame
the
doctor
wife
cool
and
dainty
put
masses
of
early
white
lilac
into
a
tall
crystal
vase
silence
reigned
the
clock
struck
eleven
then
the
baby
godmother
laid
down
the
and
began
to
speak
her
hands
clasped
firmly
around
her
large
knees
flower
when
a
man
such
as
your
husband
wants
you
you
should
leave
everything
to
go
to
him
what
are
social
engagements
and
servants
plans
ay
even
children
compared
with
the
needs
of
such
a
man
as
deryck
oh
my
dear
could
you
hear
the
appeal
in
his
voice
it
was
like
the
cry
of
a
tired
child
in
the
dark
groping
for
its
which
just
wants
lifting
up
into
its
arms
and
hushing
to
sleep
strong
man
though
he
is
and
i
suppose
you
and
i
can
hardly
realize
how
strong
he
is
when
coping
with
the
great
needs
of
others
he
will
always
be
a
boy
where
he
loves
he
is
so
young
in
heart
so
eternally
passionately
young
he
wants
mothering
just
now
he
is
doing
the
work
of
three
men
and
doing
it
at
high
pressure
i
hear
of
it
from
outside
as
perhaps
you
can
not
and
when
the
day
is
over
he
needs
a
place
of
rest
a
tender
understanding
place
of
rest
where
he
can
talk
or
be
silent
sleep
or
wake
as
the
fancy
takes
him
but
where
he
will
never
be
left
alone
to
live
again
through
the
happenings
of
the
day
too
tired
to
escape
them
and
oh
flower
you
and
you
alone
can
do
this
for
him
shall
i
tell
you
i
know
women
at
least
who
would
throw
over
social
engagements
leave
husbands
children
everything
and
go
down
to
stay
at
brighton
or
anywhere
else
on
the
chance
of
five
minutes
conversation
with
deryck
or
of
his
needing
at
the
moment
a
comrade
and
friend
horrid
creatures
cried
flower
mockingly
their
husbands
ought
to
have
something
to
say
to
them
for
running
after
mine
i
wonder
a
proper
person
like
you
jane
is
not
ashamed
to
talk
of
them
and
you
need
not
try
to
make
me
jealous
it
is
one
of
my
theories
that
only
small
minds
are
jealous
i
have
always
stood
far
above
the
feeling
i
know
dear
i
know
said
the
baby
godmother
hastily
i
had
not
the
faintest
hope
of
making
you
jealous
besides
why
should
you
be
deryck
has
never
looked
twice
at
any
woman
but
you
we
all
know
that
flower
laid
down
her
scissors
and
came
and
knelt
on
the
hearthrug
mollified
and
a
little
wistful
she
spread
out
her
damp
hands
to
the
blaze
and
looked
up
into
the
baby
godmother
plain
face
with
a
mischievous
inquisitive
smile
do
you
know
jane
she
said
i
have
sometimes
wondered
you
seem
to
know
each
other
so
intimately
whether
in
the
days
before
he
met
me
deryck
ever
proposed
to
you
the
baby
godmother
laughed
and
again
stirred
the
fire
with
her
toe
well
my
dear
you
may
rest
assured
he
never
did
so
for
the
most
conclusive
of
all
reasons
i
should
not
have
refused
him
flower
laughed
gaily
illustration
good
old
jane
she
said
i
do
enjoy
talking
to
you
good
old
jane
she
said
i
do
enjoy
talking
to
you
you
are
so
deliciously
unconventional
then
more
soberly
it
is
not
fair
that
you
should
think
i
do
not
take
proper
care
of
deryck
and
do
not
suffer
during
his
absences
i
go
through
perfect
agonies
of
mind
during
the
long
hours
of
the
night
when
he
is
tearing
down
from
scotland
by
the
mail
train
i
keep
waking
and
thinking
how
bumpy
it
must
be
to
lie
along
the
seat
of
a
railway
carriage
he
never
will
take
a
sleeper
and
i
lie
and
think
of
all
the
who
hold
his
life
in
their
hands
and
hope
they
do
drink
flower
voice
trembled
with
emotion
after
reading
about
all
those
fearful
railway
smashes
lately
i
wrote
on
one
of
his
visiting
cards
case
of
accident
wire
at
once
to
deryck
brand
wimpole
street
london
i
put
it
into
his
pocketbook
and
it
comforts
me
to
know
it
is
always
upon
him
the
lovely
eyes
of
the
doctor
wife
were
wet
her
lashes
glistened
in
the
firelight
the
baby
godmother
stooped
and
took
up
the
poker
then
laid
it
down
again
unused
well
flower
she
said
at
length
very
deliberately
and
suppose
an
accident
happened
and
they
wired
to
you
what
would
you
do
do
exclaimed
the
doctor
wife
her
lovely
eyes
dilating
why
go
to
him
of
course
but
suppose
nurse
happened
to
be
out
or
you
had
people
coming
to
tea
or
you
had
promised
the
children
jane
jane
how
odious
you
are
none
of
those
things
would
matter
of
course
if
he
were
hurt
or
ill
nothing
could
keep
me
from
his
side
i
should
not
even
stop
to
pack
i
should
fly
what
well
i
might
let
marsdon
pack
a
handbag
but
i
should
certainly
catch
the
first
possible
train
the
baby
godmother
stooped
for
the
poker
once
more
and
this
time
she
assaulted
the
dying
embers
vigorously
remarking
in
a
muffled
voice
yes
i
think
a
handbag
would
be
wise
decidedly
i
would
have
marsdon
and
a
handbag
in
the
programme
then
suddenly
dropping
the
poker
with
a
clatter
she
caught
flower
fluttering
hands
in
hers
and
held
them
firmly
looking
searchingly
into
her
upturned
face
ah
child
child
you
remind
me
of
the
story
of
a
white
sit
down
for
five
minutes
while
i
tell
it
to
you
two
friends
of
mine
have
a
lovely
little
place
in
hertfordshire
she
sybel
takes
a
great
delight
in
her
garden
particularly
in
growing
roses
they
had
one
tiny
girl
of
four
years
old
rightly
named
angela
the
sweetest
little
i
ever
beheld
i
ran
down
to
them
for
one
night
last
june
sybel
and
i
were
having
tea
in
the
garden
close
to
a
magnificent
white
a
mass
of
fragrant
bud
and
blossom
sybel
was
very
proud
of
it
presently
we
heard
little
dancing
feet
down
the
gravel
path
behind
us
and
the
appeared
she
stood
gravely
contemplating
us
at
tea
not
asking
for
anything
sybel
is
a
great
disciplinarian
suddenly
the
baby
eyes
fell
upon
the
and
a
wistful
look
of
longing
passed
into
them
she
drew
close
to
sybel
and
looked
pleadingly
up
into
her
face
mummie
they
are
lubly
may
i
pick
one
of
your
roses
not
said
sybel
often
am
i
to
tell
you
baby
that
you
are
never
to
pick
flowers
in
the
garden
run
along
to
nurse
and
do
be
troublesome
the
baby
said
no
more
but
i
saw
the
little
mouth
droop
and
quiver
the
small
feet
trailed
slowly
away
over
the
grass
all
the
dance
gone
out
of
them
and
sybel
gave
me
a
long
dissertation
on
the
bringing
up
of
children
and
the
importance
of
checking
their
natural
tendency
to
destructiveness
my
only
reply
being
i
am
afraid
on
earth
is
the
good
of
a
garden
full
of
flowers
if
your
own
baby
ca
gather
and
enjoy
them
to
which
sybel
made
answer
is
just
as
well
my
dear
jane
that
you
remain
unmarried
you
would
hopelessly
spoil
your
children
if
you
had
any
with
that
we
laughed
and
ceased
sparring
for
sybel
is
a
good
sort
and
was
a
devoted
mother
provided
her
little
child
pleased
her
in
all
things
the
baby
godmother
paused
a
moment
as
if
mentally
reviewing
a
scene
and
seeking
for
words
in
which
to
describe
it
then
she
leaned
forward
with
her
arms
upon
her
knees
and
her
hands
clasped
in
front
of
her
and
as
she
spoke
slowly
and
quietly
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
those
firmly
folded
hands
three
weeks
later
i
was
wired
for
to
go
back
there
and
comfort
a
despairing
childless
mother
when
poor
sybel
took
me
up
to
see
the
little
body
it
lay
upon
the
bed
smothered
in
white
roses
roses
in
the
little
hands
roses
round
the
tiny
feet
snowy
petals
framing
the
baby
face
now
whiter
than
the
whitest
rose
when
i
saw
them
and
when
poor
sybel
fell
on
her
knees
at
the
foot
of
the
little
bed
and
moaned
in
anguish
of
heart
i
knew
why
she
had
sent
for
me
jane
she
said
you
remember
she
wanted
white
rose
and
i
would
not
let
her
have
it
oh
my
baby
my
baby
dear
i
said
helplessly
has
them
all
now
cried
sybel
in
the
most
fearful
accents
of
despair
good
is
it
ten
thousand
roses
strewn
about
her
now
are
not
worth
the
one
gathered
by
her
own
little
hand
when
she
wanted
it
which
would
have
given
her
pleasure
then
too
late
too
late
oh
god
the
wheels
of
time
will
they
never
move
backward
shall
i
never
hear
again
my
baby
voice
saying
mummie
may
i
pick
one
of
your
roses
oh
baby
speak
to
poor
mummie
and
say
you
know
you
may
have
them
all
but
the
little
was
calmly
unresponsive
and
the
tiny
marble
hands
so
lightly
clasped
the
rose
stems
that
when
the
desperate
weeping
shook
the
bed
the
roses
those
baby
hands
seemed
holding
dropped
from
them
and
fell
unheeded
ah
poor
breaking
heart
love
offering
came
too
late
the
baby
godmother
still
kept
her
eyes
on
her
folded
hands
the
doctor
wife
was
crying
softly
oh
flower
the
deep
sad
voice
went
on
we
are
all
apt
to
make
the
same
terrible
mistake
when
our
dear
ones
have
passed
beyond
all
ken
of
earthly
pleasures
we
send
our
costly
wreaths
of
rarest
flowers
striving
thus
to
atone
for
having
denied
them
the
one
simple
blossom
which
was
all
they
asked
and
needed
let
us
learn
to
give
our
flowers
now
now
while
they
can
hold
them
and
have
them
now
while
they
can
scent
their
perfume
and
enjoy
their
beauty
oh
child
give
deryck
his
white
rose
while
he
asks
it
of
you
a
man
requires
the
instant
fulfillment
of
his
heart
desires
we
women
can
wait
some
of
us
enjoy
the
idea
of
waiting
even
for
the
wreaths
and
crosses
though
we
shall
not
be
there
to
see
them
the
morbid
picturesqueness
of
the
idea
appeals
to
us
but
a
man
wants
nothing
for
his
cold
clay
save
six
feet
of
honest
earth
his
needs
are
stronger
simpler
more
intense
than
ours
and
what
he
needs
he
needs
now
when
the
battle
is
over
and
won
he
will
leave
the
old
suit
of
armor
behind
and
forge
ahead
to
pastures
new
stand
by
him
now
in
the
din
the
dust
and
the
heat
with
the
cup
of
cold
water
he
craves
and
oh
remember
the
wheels
of
time
go
forward
always
backward
never
i
want
you
to
be
spared
the
agony
of
vain
regret
the
baby
godmother
ceased
speaking
and
looked
up
the
lines
were
hard
and
stern
about
her
mouth
and
eyes
but
the
eyes
themselves
were
soft
and
infinitely
tender
flower
rose
and
stooping
kissed
her
gently
i
wish
he
proposed
to
you
she
said
you
would
have
done
better
for
him
but
as
it
was
i
he
wanted
i
must
do
my
best
and
i
will
go
to
brighton
then
slowly
with
bent
head
she
left
the
room
the
baby
godmother
sat
lost
in
thought
for
many
minutes
it
had
cost
her
much
to
say
what
she
had
said
and
she
felt
doubtful
how
long
the
impression
she
had
made
would
endure
each
heart
must
pass
through
the
furnace
for
itself
to
hear
of
the
refining
of
others
has
no
lasting
effect
on
the
heart
own
alloy
she
knew
this
and
her
thoughts
followed
flower
anxiously
at
length
she
rose
and
stood
leaning
her
elbow
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
looking
long
at
an
old
miniature
of
the
doctor
placed
there
among
special
treasures
but
the
doctor
before
flower
knew
him
the
doctor
as
he
was
in
years
gone
by
when
he
and
the
baby
godmother
were
faithful
chums
and
she
was
his
trusted
confidante
and
the
sharer
of
all
his
hopes
and
ambitions
so
she
stood
looking
into
the
bright
dark
eyes
of
a
very
young
man
a
man
with
all
the
best
of
life
before
him
full
of
a
noble
courage
an
unfaltering
faith
in
his
ideals
an
intellect
which
should
carry
him
anywhere
he
willed
to
go
a
smile
of
conscious
power
curved
the
lips
there
was
no
hint
of
weariness
about
the
keen
clear
eyes
the
baby
godmother
took
it
up
and
laid
it
in
the
palm
of
her
large
hand
then
she
spoke
to
it
softly
oh
boy
she
said
oh
boy
i
have
done
my
best
for
you
i
would
always
have
given
you
all
i
had
to
give
but
you
wanted
loveliness
and
i
could
only
give
you
love
you
have
the
loveliness
and
now
you
are
sighing
for
the
love
god
send
you
that
my
dear
my
dear
oh
boy
i
have
done
what
i
could
she
put
the
portrait
down
and
turned
away
as
the
door
opened
suddenly
to
admit
the
doctor
wife
breathless
jane
such
a
nuisance
madame
celestine
has
arrived
i
entirely
forgot
the
appointment
my
gown
for
the
next
the
final
fitting
oh
such
a
dream
come
up
and
see
and
help
and
advise
you
old
darling
what
a
blessing
to
have
you
here
i
never
be
firm
with
celestine
the
luncheon
gong
had
sounded
punctually
as
the
clock
struck
one
the
baby
godmother
had
waited
restlessly
ten
minutes
and
then
received
a
message
not
to
wait
mrs
brand
would
be
down
from
the
workroom
shortly
booted
and
hatted
ready
for
her
journey
into
norfolk
jane
helped
herself
to
cold
chicken
and
salad
and
kept
her
eye
on
the
clock
remembering
two
sharp
if
she
comes
down
quite
ready
she
can
do
it
thought
the
godmother
and
turned
her
healthy
attention
to
and
custard
the
door
opened
and
the
doctor
wife
trailed
in
in
a
teagown
dear
jane
i
apologize
but
i
knew
my
absence
would
not
impair
your
appetite
and
you
should
not
have
left
me
until
that
good
creature
had
gone
the
restraint
of
your
presence
removed
she
launched
out
into
fresh
suggestions
and
wheedled
me
into
having
a
gown
for
the
devonshire
big
squash
though
i
had
meant
to
go
in
my
paquin
how
beautifully
you
carve
my
dear
or
did
old
stoddart
do
it
for
you
this
fowl
looks
as
if
it
had
been
handled
by
a
man
and
an
expert
now
i
fear
i
am
going
to
make
it
look
as
if
it
had
crossed
the
road
in
front
of
a
what
on
earth
are
you
gazing
at
pretty
jane
my
dearest
jane
oh
never
look
so
shy
trilled
the
doctor
wife
is
anything
wrong
with
the
custard
flower
how
are
you
to
be
ready
at
sharp
when
here
it
is
and
you
in
that
flimsy
teagown
my
dear
i
am
not
going
it
is
always
wisest
to
adhere
to
first
plans
i
should
to
go
but
i
could
not
possibly
be
ready
now
and
i
can
not
feel
it
right
to
leave
the
children
when
nurse
the
door
opened
quickly
and
the
doctor
came
in
dearest
cried
flower
lunch
after
all
if
only
i
had
known
you
were
coming
i
would
have
saved
a
wing
no
said
the
doctor
brightly
no
time
for
lunch
and
i
hardly
ought
to
have
come
upstairs
i
have
one
more
patient
to
see
and
my
hansom
is
at
the
door
but
i
wanted
to
say
dear
and
also
to
say
he
dropped
his
voice
slightly
do
worry
about
not
having
been
able
to
come
it
was
selfish
of
me
to
ask
it
of
you
flower
and
then
i
remembered
too
jeanette
was
going
home
so
i
ran
up
to
bid
her
a
longer
farewell
than
ours
he
went
round
the
table
and
held
out
his
hand
to
the
baby
godmother
jeanette
my
love
to
all
at
home
look
us
up
again
when
you
can
and
thank
you
for
all
your
to
me
and
mine
the
baby
godmother
rose
and
her
hand
went
firmly
home
to
his
their
eyes
were
almost
on
a
level
as
they
stood
together
boy
she
said
do
overwork
rest
whenever
possible
and
remember
you
and
yours
are
always
dear
to
me
let
me
do
all
i
can
a
look
leaped
into
his
eyes
at
sound
of
the
old
name
it
was
many
years
since
she
had
used
it
he
held
her
hand
and
looked
at
her
with
steady
scrutiny
for
a
moment
she
met
his
gaze
full
and
clear
she
had
nothing
to
hide
dear
said
the
doctor
then
turned
to
his
wife
and
hesitated
flower
he
said
rather
wistfully
flower
objected
to
any
demonstration
in
public
she
waved
her
napkin
my
lord
she
said
and
while
you
are
gallivanting
about
at
brighton
please
remember
your
poor
little
domesticated
wife
staying
at
home
to
tend
house
and
children
the
door
closed
sharply
behind
the
doctor
the
baby
godmother
bent
over
her
plate
in
silence
the
doctor
wife
laughed
moved
round
the
table
to
cut
a
slice
of
cake
laughed
again
rather
mirthlessly
then
reiterated
all
the
reasons
why
it
was
unreasonable
of
deryck
to
have
asked
her
to
go
to
brighton
and
of
jane
to
have
made
such
a
point
of
her
acquiescing
concluding
with
and
why
do
you
call
him
such
a
silly
inappropriate
name
and
oh
i
wish
i
had
gone
i
hear
his
hansom
what
a
hateful
world
eight
in
the
evening
the
soft
green
curtains
were
drawn
in
flower
boudoir
shutting
out
the
chill
of
the
spring
night
air
the
electric
light
shining
through
gleamed
soft
and
bright
from
walls
and
flower
had
turned
on
every
spray
hoping
to
lighten
with
exterior
brightness
the
heavy
shadow
of
disappointment
and
foreboding
which
had
fallen
upon
her
heart
since
the
doctor
hansom
had
tinkled
rapidly
away
towards
victoria
all
had
gone
wrong
with
the
doctor
wife
the
baby
godmother
who
had
had
so
much
to
say
in
the
morning
became
absolutely
monosyllabic
and
conversation
languished
and
died
it
was
a
relief
to
see
her
depart
with
her
neat
gentlemanly
luggage
for
liverpool
street
station
and
yet
it
seemed
desolate
without
her
and
the
of
her
rapidly
receding
hansom
made
a
second
sound
to
be
added
to
the
series
of
knells
which
should
ring
in
flower
heart
that
day
turning
from
the
she
ran
up
to
the
nursery
to
find
out
at
what
hour
nurse
wished
to
be
free
for
her
outing
and
found
it
was
for
which
nurse
had
asked
not
nurse
was
quite
sure
she
had
said
wednesday
how
could
she
have
said
tuesday
when
the
married
niece
to
whom
she
was
going
always
went
out
to
tea
on
tuesdays
with
her
in
pimlico
but
of
course
master
deryck
hammering
at
the
time
which
may
have
accounted
for
his
mamma
not
rightly
catching
the
day
emma
came
forward
a
ready
witness
to
the
fact
that
nurse
had
most
certainly
said
wednesday
and
stuck
to
her
guns
in
spite
of
dicky
quiet
little
voice
asserting
gravely
from
the
position
he
had
taken
up
at
his
mother
side
had
gone
down
for
the
milk
so
the
doctor
wife
retreated
in
discomfiture
and
trailed
slowly
downstairs
facing
the
fact
that
the
one
reason
which
had
seemed
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
her
falling
in
with
her
husband
wish
and
plan
had
been
a
mistake
a
stupid
careless
mistake
what
would
jane
say
if
she
knew
the
tersely
expressed
remark
with
which
jane
would
most
likely
define
the
situation
came
into
her
mind
and
she
smiled
a
wan
little
smile
for
the
doctor
wife
possessed
the
saving
sense
of
humor
then
she
felt
more
cheerful
rang
and
ordered
the
motor
and
dressed
for
a
spin
in
the
park
but
everything
spoke
of
brighton
and
the
enjoyment
she
might
have
had
with
the
doctor
on
this
lovely
day
the
sun
was
almost
warm
and
there
was
a
pursuing
scent
of
violets
in
the
air
the
crocuses
were
shouting
to
the
sparrows
and
the
hyacinths
pushed
their
bright
heads
up
through
the
brown
earth
obedient
to
the
beckoning
of
the
sunshine
the
whole
park
sang
of
springtime
of
life
and
love
and
joys
to
come
and
she
longed
for
him
beside
her
with
his
keen
enjoyment
with
his
quick
way
of
pointing
out
a
fresh
beauty
which
she
might
otherwise
have
overlooked
with
his
knack
of
making
you
feel
that
you
were
alive
and
living
every
minute
to
the
full
receiving
all
it
had
to
give
and
above
all
with
the
adoration
of
his
love
wrapping
her
round
and
making
her
feel
herself
to
be
good
and
beautiful
and
worthy
this
afternoon
she
sadly
needed
reinstating
in
her
own
esteem
she
knew
she
was
being
unjust
to
herself
but
she
felt
selfish
and
inadequate
and
unworthy
of
him
and
of
his
love
it
was
jane
who
had
given
her
this
uncomfortable
feeling
it
was
odious
of
jane
to
call
him
boy
and
to
pretend
to
understand
his
needs
better
than
she
his
own
wife
did
oh
if
only
she
had
gone
to
brighton
if
only
she
had
gone
but
it
was
not
fault
that
she
had
been
unable
to
fall
in
with
the
plan
at
so
short
notice
deryck
himself
had
admitted
that
it
was
he
who
was
to
blame
and
she
was
not
to
worry
it
was
all
very
well
for
men
to
tell
poor
anxious
women
not
to
worry
he
might
have
known
she
would
be
wondering
all
the
rest
of
the
day
how
he
was
faring
at
brighton
whether
he
was
too
tired
to
eat
and
too
tired
to
sleep
if
only
horrid
old
celebrities
would
die
at
once
when
they
fell
ill
instead
of
causing
all
this
fuss
and
trouble
it
would
be
a
great
pity
to
be
too
tired
to
eat
at
the
metropole
where
the
table
dinner
was
so
perfect
it
was
trying
of
deryck
to
rush
off
with
only
a
packet
of
sandwiches
in
his
bag
when
by
taking
five
minutes
more
from
his
tiresome
patients
he
might
have
had
the
wing
of
a
chicken
and
some
salad
what
a
good
lunch
jane
had
made
if
she
had
been
so
troubled
at
the
thought
of
deryck
going
off
alone
she
would
hardly
have
hurried
into
the
the
moment
the
gong
sounded
and
given
her
mind
so
completely
to
her
food
jane
was
the
sort
of
person
who
enjoyed
putting
other
people
in
the
wrong
so
different
to
deryck
who
saw
at
once
where
the
blame
really
belonged
and
never
laid
it
upon
others
which
was
it
most
right
to
believe
deryck
or
jane
deryck
of
course
then
why
feel
condemned
any
longer
how
lovely
it
would
have
been
at
brighton
a
person
would
have
gone
at
once
and
not
have
been
so
considerate
for
tiresome
old
nurse
with
her
changeable
plans
people
who
change
their
plans
without
any
adequate
reason
do
not
deserve
much
consideration
if
she
had
been
a
less
devoted
mother
how
sweet
it
was
of
dicky
to
point
out
that
emma
had
gone
down
for
the
milk
so
like
deryck
who
never
would
allow
her
to
be
unjustly
put
in
the
wrong
it
was
wonderful
to
be
so
loved
by
two
such
natures
father
and
son
a
woman
who
was
selfish
or
unworthy
could
never
have
drawn
out
such
love
jane
was
not
in
the
least
likely
ever
to
marry
how
disgusting
of
her
to
speak
so
approvingly
of
married
women
who
ran
after
deryck
perhaps
after
all
one
of
those
creatures
would
happen
to
be
at
the
metropole
this
evening
and
would
insist
upon
dining
with
him
at
a
table
for
two
another
wan
little
smile
flitted
across
flower
face
the
dimple
the
doctor
loved
peeped
out
she
knew
so
exactly
how
he
would
feel
and
look
and
how
he
would
describe
the
whole
occurrence
to
her
afterwards
giving
her
unconsciously
the
gratifying
certainty
that
in
her
absence
no
other
woman
could
by
any
possibility
usurp
her
place
the
gliding
motion
of
the
car
made
her
drowsy
she
leaned
back
with
closed
eyes
enjoying
the
sensation
of
speeding
forward
trusting
to
the
deft
vigilance
of
her
chauffeur
not
even
seeing
for
herself
the
possible
collisions
avoided
the
rapid
which
meant
gliding
from
danger
into
safety
the
roar
of
traffic
on
the
distant
thoroughfare
sounded
like
the
breaking
of
the
waves
on
the
beach
at
brighton
she
fancied
herself
driving
along
the
king
road
alighting
at
the
metropole
and
meeting
deryck
to
whom
she
would
say
dearest
i
came
after
all
the
sudden
slowing
of
the
car
aroused
her
they
were
held
up
for
a
moment
in
a
of
carriages
near
the
main
gate
she
opened
her
eyes
and
they
fell
upon
a
man
and
woman
close
by
sitting
side
by
side
in
a
victoria
the
woman
had
a
spray
of
white
roses
on
her
muff
her
companion
bent
towards
her
with
a
whispered
word
she
instantly
detached
a
bud
from
the
rest
and
handed
it
to
him
her
look
of
blissful
submissive
love
as
she
did
this
reached
to
the
motor
as
an
enlightening
beam
the
man
took
the
rose
and
fastened
it
carefully
in
his
without
any
expressed
thanks
but
as
he
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
beside
her
his
look
of
restful
and
masterful
possession
of
herself
and
all
she
possessed
seemed
fully
to
content
the
woman
her
eyes
and
lips
smiled
tenderly
and
lifting
the
white
roses
she
laid
them
for
a
moment
against
her
cheek
home
said
the
doctor
wife
suddenly
and
as
the
car
turned
obediently
and
sped
out
at
the
gate
the
voice
of
the
baby
godmother
seemed
to
pursue
her
relentlessly
deryck
his
white
rose
while
he
asks
it
of
you
a
man
requires
the
instant
fulfillment
of
his
heart
desires
when
he
needs
a
thing
he
needs
now
ah
jeanette
you
were
very
faithful
and
you
did
what
you
could
arrived
at
home
the
doctor
wife
had
tea
in
company
with
one
or
two
choice
spirits
who
dropped
in
to
discuss
the
reception
at
myra
ingleby
and
the
coming
big
affair
at
the
devonshire
and
much
interest
was
aroused
by
the
fact
that
the
doctor
wife
was
going
in
her
paquin
but
was
to
have
an
absolutely
new
creation
by
that
clever
old
dear
celestine
after
all
jane
with
her
attention
fixed
upon
and
her
mind
so
completely
blankly
unsympathetic
was
enough
to
depress
anybody
deryck
would
be
the
first
to
be
indignant
if
he
knew
what
jane
had
said
her
visitors
gone
she
rang
for
the
children
and
the
promised
game
of
menagerie
began
though
their
small
minds
had
leaped
to
something
else
which
they
assured
her
they
would
like
much
better
but
she
insisted
on
the
menagerie
rapidly
pulling
all
the
stuffed
animals
out
of
the
toy
cupboard
and
hurrying
them
into
the
middle
of
the
room
she
felt
unable
to
endure
that
no
part
of
the
programme
she
had
explained
to
deryck
should
take
place
and
for
many
years
to
come
the
children
used
to
speak
between
themselves
of
menageries
as
mother
favorite
game
all
went
well
for
a
time
she
enjoyed
sitting
on
the
soft
carpet
with
blossom
rolling
over
her
a
creamy
billow
of
cashmere
and
lace
and
small
deryck
in
his
black
velvet
suit
with
his
neat
little
black
silk
legs
and
buckled
shoes
gravely
marshalling
the
animals
and
explaining
the
mental
condition
of
each
their
relation
to
one
another
and
their
past
and
present
experiences
but
by
and
by
he
began
asking
awkward
questions
about
noah
ark
and
would
not
be
put
off
with
evasive
answers
the
doctor
wife
felt
helpless
she
knew
little
of
animals
less
of
ships
and
nothing
whatever
of
ancient
preachers
of
righteousness
a
complete
and
comprehensive
knowledge
of
all
three
would
have
been
required
to
have
satisfactorily
answered
dicky
questions
so
harassed
and
worried
she
entrenched
herself
hastily
in
what
appeared
to
be
an
impregnable
position
my
dear
little
boy
how
can
i
possibly
tell
was
not
deryck
the
younger
was
arranging
that
a
bear
who
could
only
sit
who
had
been
born
sitting
and
stiffened
in
that
position
should
ride
in
the
procession
on
the
wide
back
of
an
elephant
but
he
stopped
the
procession
at
this
set
the
bear
down
and
came
and
stood
opposite
his
mother
surveying
her
gravely
with
his
hands
deep
in
the
pockets
of
his
velvet
breeches
she
sat
on
the
floor
beside
the
sofa
her
lovely
head
thrown
back
against
a
cushion
looking
up
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
love
and
almost
wistful
tenderness
his
little
face
at
first
was
rather
hard
and
stern
but
as
he
looked
at
her
it
softened
her
ignorance
of
noah
domestic
arrangements
seemed
to
matter
less
she
was
that
it
seemed
unreasonable
to
expect
her
to
be
other
things
you
are
not
much
use
at
answering
questions
darling
are
you
he
said
gravely
i
must
let
the
point
stand
over
until
father
comes
home
you
see
you
never
seem
to
know
about
anything
you
have
not
done
yourself
illustration
you
are
not
much
use
at
answering
questions
darling
are
you
dicky
you
are
not
kind
to
poor
mummie
protested
flower
piteously
no
one
could
know
what
noah
did
to
the
animals
in
the
ark
when
the
large
ones
trod
upon
the
small
ones
or
how
the
elephant
was
kept
from
stepping
on
the
grasshopper
an
average
person
would
know
dicky
insisted
coldly
dicky
you
are
most
unkind
you
imply
that
i
am
stupid
i
am
afraid
you
are
darling
said
the
quiet
little
voice
and
then
in
a
sudden
burst
of
admiration
but
you
are
too
lovely
for
it
to
matter
and
the
miniature
edition
of
the
doctor
fell
upon
her
and
clasped
her
in
his
arms
we
must
say
our
text
to
you
mother
as
father
is
away
dicky
remarked
a
few
minutes
later
when
bedtime
came
flower
assented
without
enthusiasm
she
did
not
approve
of
nurse
plan
of
teaching
the
children
a
daily
text
and
always
wondered
why
deryck
encouraged
it
but
she
did
not
wish
again
to
present
herself
to
her
little
son
mind
in
a
disappointing
light
dicky
arranged
baby
blossom
in
a
row
with
himself
she
immediately
began
to
say
do
it
do
it
and
had
to
be
sternly
hushed
by
her
brother
then
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
head
erect
dicky
announced
impressively
jesus
said
you
shall
ask
anythink
in
my
name
i
will
now
baby
do
it
chirped
baby
blossom
very
nice
commented
flower
perfunctorily
baby
blossom
her
duty
done
took
a
header
into
the
soft
shrieking
with
delight
and
waving
her
plump
little
legs
in
the
air
deryck
though
deserted
kept
his
place
in
the
row
he
had
not
yet
finished
with
the
text
do
you
consider
it
true
mother
he
questioned
and
his
dark
eyes
searched
her
face
why
well
yes
dear
i
suppose
so
answered
flower
vaguely
baby
take
care
you
will
break
your
neck
what
does
mean
inquired
dicky
you
should
not
say
it
is
it
is
in
nurse
bible
asserted
dicky
and
i
suppose
it
means
all
that
comes
into
your
head
anything
you
can
think
of
i
believe
said
flower
with
a
sudden
inspiration
that
it
merely
refers
to
the
religious
experience
of
the
apostles
goodness
said
dicky
in
nurse
best
manner
when
arguing
with
marsdon
then
why
do
it
say
so
adding
almost
immediately
in
his
own
quiet
rather
sad
little
voice
and
what
good
is
it
to
us
then
mummie
none
whatever
replied
flower
with
decision
rising
from
the
floor
and
hugging
baby
she
felt
she
was
scoring
now
and
reasserting
her
mental
superiority
that
is
why
i
object
to
people
teaching
such
words
to
children
she
remarked
from
among
blossom
curls
the
small
deryck
was
silent
he
stood
very
erect
and
gave
a
sharp
pull
to
the
front
of
his
little
white
swallowing
hard
as
if
something
had
hurt
him
flower
felt
slightly
uncomfortable
at
being
thus
suddenly
left
with
the
last
word
dicky
was
so
very
masculine
and
she
was
not
at
all
sure
of
her
own
theology
the
silence
growing
strained
was
relieved
by
the
advent
of
nurse
who
carried
off
baby
blossom
and
bade
dicky
make
haste
and
say
to
his
mamma
and
come
along
he
turned
to
her
gravely
mother
he
said
flower
embraced
him
effusively
and
suggested
a
visit
to
the
zoo
now
the
warm
weather
was
coming
dicky
allowed
himself
to
be
kissed
but
ignored
the
remark
about
the
zoo
when
he
reached
the
door
he
turned
and
looked
back
bravely
mother
he
said
i
do
know
about
the
but
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
have
made
that
text
my
nurse
says
you
can
always
make
a
text
your
if
it
meets
your
need
i
feel
this
meets
my
need
he
held
his
head
bravely
though
flinching
a
little
as
if
dreading
his
mother
scorn
or
laughter
but
flower
did
not
laugh
she
looked
across
the
room
at
the
brave
little
figure
in
blank
astonishment
the
sincerity
of
his
convictions
reached
and
convinced
her
but
what
an
ignorant
old
puritan
nurse
must
be
at
last
she
smiled
at
dicky
reassuringly
that
may
be
true
darling
but
my
dear
little
boy
you
have
any
oh
have
i
said
dicky
as
one
who
would
say
that
is
all
know
then
taking
hold
of
the
outer
handle
he
drew
the
door
slowly
behind
him
turning
before
it
quite
closed
to
fling
back
over
his
shoulder
i
need
an
entirely
new
inside
to
my
rabbit
left
alone
another
remark
of
dicky
returned
to
flower
mind
and
added
to
her
despondency
you
never
seem
to
know
about
anything
you
have
not
done
yourself
her
little
son
had
said
and
this
assertion
let
in
a
sudden
light
of
revelation
upon
her
whole
mental
standpoint
how
true
it
was
how
sickeningly
horribly
true
what
did
she
know
of
deryck
work
of
all
the
people
who
came
and
went
in
the
rooms
below
of
the
lectures
he
gave
or
the
essays
he
wrote
eagerly
attended
eagerly
read
by
hundreds
what
share
had
she
in
the
great
interests
of
her
husband
life
jane
had
tried
to
speak
of
them
more
than
once
and
she
had
changed
the
subject
and
sitting
there
deeply
convicted
by
the
grave
little
voice
of
her
own
tiny
boy
she
remembered
times
when
deryck
had
tried
to
talk
to
her
of
these
questions
so
near
his
heart
of
the
methods
he
had
thought
out
for
curing
diseased
or
weakened
wills
for
restoring
shattered
nerves
and
unbalanced
brains
for
giving
a
new
lease
of
sane
and
healthy
life
to
those
who
now
walked
fettered
in
the
valley
of
a
shadow
worse
than
death
and
she
had
taken
no
interest
had
not
tried
to
understand
had
listened
without
hearing
and
at
the
first
opportunity
talked
of
her
own
trivial
doings
was
not
an
intelligent
sympathy
with
his
work
one
of
the
white
roses
for
which
deryck
well
might
ask
slowly
she
passed
to
her
bedroom
and
dressed
for
the
function
wishing
all
the
while
that
she
need
not
go
and
partook
of
an
early
dinner
alone
with
her
thoughts
far
away
now
it
was
eight
and
she
sat
in
her
boudoir
waiting
until
it
should
be
time
to
be
whirled
through
the
noisy
lighted
streets
to
join
the
gay
throng
at
myra
crush
oh
how
different
to
have
walked
on
the
pier
with
him
nestling
into
her
furs
enjoying
the
cold
night
air
and
salty
smell
of
brine
and
seaweed
and
then
to
have
returned
to
their
warm
bright
room
deryck
pleased
as
any
schoolboy
to
have
her
away
without
her
maid
amusing
her
by
his
delightful
attempts
to
take
marsdon
place
and
assist
at
her
toilet
the
fire
which
had
received
so
much
unconscious
attention
from
the
baby
godmother
that
morning
fell
together
in
the
grate
signifying
its
need
of
coal
the
doctor
wife
rose
and
ministered
to
it
then
knelt
on
the
hearthrug
and
watched
the
brightening
flame
her
mind
had
gone
forward
in
its
contemplation
of
that
evening
which
might
have
been
her
eyes
were
soft
and
tender
her
sweet
lips
parted
gently
her
hair
gleamed
golden
in
the
firelight
how
wonderful
was
his
love
jane
was
right
when
she
said
he
will
always
be
a
boy
where
he
loves
he
is
so
young
in
heart
so
eternally
passionately
young
how
did
jane
guess
it
only
she
his
wife
could
it
to
be
true
seven
years
of
married
life
had
only
added
to
the
wonder
and
romance
of
deryck
love
each
time
he
took
her
away
with
him
was
like
a
fresh
honeymoon
more
perfect
than
the
last
why
did
she
forget
when
she
came
home
how
sweet
it
was
to
be
away
with
him
why
had
she
defrauded
herself
and
him
of
the
perfect
hours
which
might
have
been
theirs
this
day
why
had
she
failed
him
in
his
time
of
need
oh
selfish
shallow
loving
to
loved
not
rising
to
the
joy
of
loving
taking
his
care
and
thought
and
adoration
as
her
due
giving
no
tender
service
in
return
she
bowed
her
head
upon
her
arms
oh
boy
she
said
not
jane
but
oh
boy
it
shall
be
different
you
will
come
back
to
find
a
wife
who
understands
a
wife
whose
hands
are
filled
with
roses
white
ready
to
give
them
now
the
doorbell
sounded
she
rose
and
wrapped
her
cloak
about
her
she
had
little
inclination
for
myra
party
but
he
would
be
thinking
of
her
there
and
anywhere
would
do
to
pass
the
hours
till
his
return
stoddart
brought
in
a
telegram
retired
softly
and
closed
the
door
she
looked
at
it
with
a
sudden
thrill
of
comprehending
joy
a
message
from
deryck
he
nearly
always
sent
her
one
ah
if
she
had
remembered
to
do
the
same
for
him
she
glanced
at
the
clock
twenty
minutes
past
eight
too
late
to
get
one
through
she
slipped
off
her
cloak
and
sank
into
an
holding
the
unopened
message
in
her
hand
she
wished
to
realize
to
the
full
the
newness
of
what
it
meant
to
receive
words
from
him
then
when
her
heart
was
ready
she
opened
the
orange
envelope
gently
and
drew
out
the
folded
paper
it
seemed
a
long
message
she
read
it
through
once
she
read
it
through
again
then
she
sat
quite
still
and
listened
to
the
ticking
of
the
clock
then
she
looked
at
it
again
and
heard
a
frightened
voice
not
unlike
her
own
reading
it
aloud
the
commissioner
of
police
to
announce
deryck
brand
knocked
down
by
corner
king
road
killed
instantly
wire
she
rose
and
walked
to
the
door
it
opened
as
she
reached
it
and
stoddart
stood
there
saying
the
brougham
waited
she
waved
him
aside
i
shall
not
want
it
thank
you
passing
into
her
room
she
closed
the
door
the
electric
light
over
her
shone
brightly
she
switched
it
off
then
in
the
utter
darkness
she
felt
her
way
to
the
empty
bed
his
bed
and
hers
laid
down
the
telegram
upon
it
and
stood
quite
still
o
god
she
whispered
help
me
to
think
i
am
not
clever
my
little
boy
thinks
me
stupid
and
my
big
boy
thinks
me
lovely
but
thou
knowest
my
loveliness
seems
to
me
but
filthy
rags
but
now
in
my
hour
of
need
oh
merciful
god
let
me
think
there
is
something
i
want
to
remember
ah
she
almost
shrieked
the
wheels
of
time
the
wheels
of
time
never
move
backwards
they
say
always
forwards
always
forwards
and
that
is
why
it
is
too
late
o
god
too
late
too
late
my
roses
ready
ready
for
him
but
too
late
what
did
the
children
say
ye
shall
ask
anything
in
my
name
i
will
do
it
and
dicky
says
anything
means
anything
we
need
god
in
heaven
i
need
the
wheels
of
time
to
move
back
six
hours
that
i
may
go
with
him
she
flung
herself
upon
her
knees
beside
the
bed
o
god
o
god
in
jesus
name
put
back
the
wheels
of
time
that
i
may
go
with
him
she
shrieked
then
crammed
the
quilt
into
her
mouth
lest
they
should
hear
and
find
her
there
o
god
o
god
in
jesus
name
the
wheels
of
time
back
back
that
i
may
go
with
him
she
tore
down
her
lovely
hair
and
wound
it
round
her
hands
the
pain
kept
her
from
swooning
helped
her
to
think
o
god
in
heaven
in
jesus
name
put
back
the
wheels
of
time
that
i
may
go
with
him
if
ye
shall
ask
anything
dicky
not
mere
religious
experiences
but
anything
we
want
o
god
i
want
another
chance
back
back
that
i
may
go
with
him
then
she
knelt
very
still
deathly
still
while
her
heart
thundered
in
her
ears
and
the
room
rocked
to
and
fro
but
she
clung
to
the
bedclothes
and
knelt
on
the
street
door
banged
she
heard
a
step
come
up
the
stairs
she
cried
again
o
god
o
god
the
wheels
of
time
back
back
the
door
opened
and
closed
someone
stood
just
within
breathing
quickly
listening
intently
then
the
doctor
voice
said
in
the
dark
my
darling
why
what
is
the
matter
and
the
room
flashed
into
light
o
god
she
said
o
god
the
wheels
of
time
turned
back
that
i
may
go
with
him
his
arms
were
round
her
he
had
lifted
her
bodily
and
placed
her
on
the
bed
his
face
was
shocked
and
startled
he
unwound
the
lovely
hair
from
the
clenched
hands
and
noted
how
much
of
it
fell
away
in
scattered
wisps
to
the
floor
he
wiped
the
blood
from
those
sweet
lips
bitten
through
then
he
knelt
down
gathered
her
to
his
heart
and
spoke
very
gently
flower
my
flower
something
has
frightened
you
you
have
had
a
shock
but
it
is
all
right
now
my
heart
dearest
i
have
come
back
to
you
listen
beloved
i
was
so
pleased
because
i
got
through
the
consultation
earlier
than
i
thought
and
found
if
i
made
a
dash
for
it
i
could
just
catch
the
fast
train
up
i
dined
on
board
listen
flower
do
keep
on
whispering
child
never
mind
the
wheels
of
time
listen
to
me
i
meant
to
hurry
home
and
dress
and
give
you
a
surprise
by
turning
up
at
myra
but
then
i
felt
too
chilled
and
determined
i
must
stay
at
home
and
have
a
brew
of
gruel
some
other
chap
in
a
hurry
a
doctor
who
left
before
me
went
off
with
my
overcoat
and
i
had
to
turn
out
without
one
no
time
to
make
inquiries
such
a
cold
fellow
has
come
back
to
his
little
girl
wo
she
see
about
warming
him
the
gay
voice
ceased
the
set
face
bent
over
her
the
quick
professional
eye
noted
each
rigid
muscle
of
that
poor
agonized
face
he
laid
his
lips
on
hers
with
one
broken
sob
oh
my
beloved
for
god
sake
then
flower
lifted
up
her
hand
and
pointed
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
looked
and
saw
the
open
telegram
reaching
with
one
long
arm
he
took
it
up
and
read
it
good
heavens
he
said
run
down
and
killed
the
poor
chap
who
took
my
coat
my
pocketbook
was
in
it
and
a
bundle
of
letters
then
he
bent
over
his
wife
once
more
and
whispered
in
a
tone
of
awed
wonder
oh
flower
cared
like
this
and
the
wonder
in
his
voice
the
almost
boyish
surprise
saved
flower
she
turned
her
face
to
his
breast
and
wept
and
wept
wept
herself
to
calmness
and
sobbed
herself
back
into
the
haven
of
his
love
the
earthly
paradise
of
her
heart
peace
illustration
oh
flower
you
cared
like
this
when
at
last
she
found
speech
possible
she
said
if
i
had
gone
hush
my
perfect
one
the
doctor
said
you
were
quite
right
but
she
laid
her
hand
over
his
mouth
with
a
swift
silencing
gesture
then
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
with
infinite
humility
and
tenderness
deryck
she
said
it
is
love
which
has
been
perfect
i
have
been
quite
wrong
but
god
in
his
infinite
mercy
has
heard
my
prayer
and
given
me
another
chance
oh
my
beloved
i
have
but
a
poor
white
rose
to
offer
you
a
crushed
and
faded
thing
but
it
is
all
your
own
give
me
another
chance
oh
deryck
a
chance
to
it
is
all
i
ask
it
is
all
i
want
to
serve
because
now
indeed
i
truly
love
then
the
doctor
knew
that
at
last
life
held
for
him
all
that
his
heart
had
craved
through
hungry
years
mary
he
said
oh
mary
he
dropped
his
head
upon
her
breast
in
sudden
silence
and
her
white
hands
like
roses
clasped
it
softly
and
lay
upon
the
darkness
of
his
hair
