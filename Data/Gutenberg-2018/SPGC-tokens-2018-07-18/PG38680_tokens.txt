of

probably
the
aptest
expression
of

men
immediate

with

such
a
subject
as
the
thirteenth
greatest
of

though
tennyson
was
confessedly
only
remodeling
the
thoughts
of
the
thirteenth
century
we
would
not
be
willing
to
concede
that
nothing
new
was
said
or
else
something
so
said
was
nothing
for
the
loss
of
the
idyls
would
make
a
large
lacuna
in
the
literature
of
the
nineteenth
century
if
it
is
allowed
to
compare
little
things
with
great
a
similar
intent
to
that
of
the
laureate
has
seemed
sufficient
justification
for
the
paradox
the
author
has
tried
to
set
forth
in
this
volume
it
may
prove
nothing
worth
mere
chaff
and
draff
much
better
burnt
but
many
friends
have
insisted
they
found
it
interesting
authors
usually
blame
friends
for
their
inflictions
upon
the
public
and
i
fear
that
i
can
find
no
better
excuse
though
the
book
has
been
patiently
labored
at
with
the
idea
that
it
should
represent
some
of
the
serious
work
that
is
being
done
by
the
catholic
summer
school
on
lake
champlain
viii
now
completing
nearly
a
decade
and
a
half
of
its
existence
this
volume
is
it
is
hoped
but
the
first
of
a
series
that
will
bring
to
a
wider
audience
some
of
the
thoughts
that
have
been
gathered
for
summer
school
friends
by
many
workers
and
will
put
in
more
permanent
form
contributions
that
made
summer
leisure
respond
to
the
greek
term
for
school
the
object
of
the
book
is
to
interpret
in
terms
that
will
be
readily
intelligible
to
this
generation
the
life
and
concerns
of
the
people
of
a
century
who
to
the
author
mind
have
done
more
for
human
progress
than
those
of
any
like
period
in
human
history
there
are
few
whose
eyes
are
now
holden
as
they
used
to
be
as
to
the
surpassing
place
in
the
history
of
culture
of
the
last
three
centuries
of
the
middle
ages
personally
the
author
is
convinced
however
that
only
a
beginning
of
proper
appreciation
has
come
as
yet
and
he
feels
that
the
solution
of
many
problems
that
are
vexing
the
modern
world
especially
in
the
social
order
are
to
be
found
in
these
much
misunderstood
ages
and
above
all
in
that
culmination
of
medieval
progress
the
period
from
to
the
subject
was
originally
taken
up
as
a
series
of
lectures
in
the
extension
course
of
the
catholic
summer
school
as
given
each
year
in
lent
and
advent
at
the
catholic
club
new
york
city
portions
of
the
material
were
subsequently
used
in
lectures
in
many
cities
in
this
country
from
portland
to
portland
paul
to
new
orleans
la
the
subject
was
treated
for
the
brooklyn
institute
of
arts
and
sciences
in
after
which
publication
was
suggested
the
author
does
not
flatter
himself
that
the
book
adequately
represents
the
great
period
which
it
claims
to
present
the
subject
has
been
the
central
idea
of
studies
in
leisure
moments
for
a
dozen
years
and
during
many
wanderings
in
europe
but
there
will
doubtless
prove
to
be
errors
in
detail
for
which
the
author
would
crave
the
indulgence
of
more
serious
students
ix
of
history
the
original
form
in
which
the
material
was
cast
has
influenced
the
style
to
some
extent
and
has
made
the
book
more
wordy
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
and
has
been
the
cause
of
certain
repetitions
that
appear
more
striking
in
print
than
they
seemed
in
manuscript
there
were
what
seemed
good
reasons
for
not
delaying
publication
however
and
leisure
for
further
work
at
it
instead
of
growing
was
becoming
more
scant
it
is
intrusted
to
the
tender
mercies
of
critics
then
and
the
benevolent
reader
if
he
still
may
be
appealed
to
for
the
sake
of
the
ideas
it
contains
in
spite
of
their
inadequate
expression
preface
georgetown
university
edition
this
third
edition
is
published
under
the
patronage
of
georgetown
university
as
a
slight
token
of
appreciation
for
the
degree
of
doctor
of
letters
conferred
on
the
author
for
this
work
at
the
last
commencement
this
issue
has
been
enlarged
by
the
addition
of
many
illustrations
selected
to
bring
out
the
fact
that
all
the
various
parts
of
europe
shared
in
the
achievements
of
the
time
and
by
an
appendix
containing
in
compendium
chapters
that
might
have
been
each
of
these
brief
sketches
could
easily
have
been
extended
to
the
average
length
of
the
original
chapters
it
was
impossible
to
use
all
the
material
that
was
gathered
these
hints
of
further
sources
are
now
appended
so
as
to
afford
suggestions
for
study
to
those
who
may
care
to
follow
up
the
idea
of
the
thirteenth
as
the
greatest
of
centuries
that
is
of
that
period
in
human
existence
when
thoughts
on
all
the
important
human
interests
were
profoundly
valuable
for
future
generations
and
their
accomplishments
models
for
all
the
after
time
x
preface
fourth
edition
many
of
the
now
rather
numerous
readers
and
hearers
of
this
book
for
it
has
been
read
in
the
refectories
of
over
religious
communities
have
said
that
the
title
seemed
almost
deterring
at
first
because
of
the
high
claim
that
is
set
up
for
a
medieval
century
to
mitigate
the
possible
initial
deterrent
effect
of
the
paradox
of
the
thirteenth
as
the
greatest
of
centuries
it
has
seemed
worth
while
in
this
edition
then
to
premise
a
series
of
quotations
from
some
of
the
most
distinguished
historical
writers
in
english
of
our
own
time
which
amply
justify
the
claim
here
set
up
frederic
harrison
macaulay
freeman
and
fiske
are
sufficiently
different
in
themselves
to
make
their
agreement
in
supreme
admiration
for
the
thirteenth
century
very
striking
in
spite
of
their
lack
of
sympathy
with
many
things
in
the
period
all
of
them
emphatically
declare
that
it
is
the
source
of
most
that
is
great
and
good
since
and
that
while
we
have
added
details
we
have
failed
to
surpass
its
artistic
and
intellectual
achievement
in
all
the
years
that
have
elapsed

success

edition
of

of
which
were
issued
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
accede
to
the
request
of
the
supreme
officers
of
the
order
to
permit
them
to
issue
a
correspondingly
large
edition
of
the
present
volume
the
good
work
which
the
knights
of
columbus
have
thus
done
in
diffusing
a
knowledge
of
the
true
relations
of
the
church
to
science
generous
patronage
and
encouragement
instead
of
supposed
opposition
will
i
think
be
greatly
furthered
by
the
wide
distribution
of
the
information
contained
in
this
volume
with
regard
to
the
supremely
helpful
attitude
of
the
church
towards
art
and
architecture
literature
education
and
above
all
the
important
social
problems
which
is
so
well
illustrated
during
the
great
period
of
the
thirteenth
century
i
sincerely
hope
that
brother
knights
of
columbus
will
find
in
the
book
some
of
that
renewal
of
devotion
to
mother
church
that
came
as
the
result
of
my
own
studies
of
this
glorious
period
of
her
history
when
her
action
was
untrammelled
by
political
considerations
and
when
she
was
free
to
express
herself
in
every
great
movement
for
the
benefit
of
humanity

on
the
place
of
the
thirteenth

epochs
of
effort
after
a
new
life
that
of
the
age
of
aquinas
roger
bacon
francis
louis
giotto
and
dante
is
the
most
purely
spiritual
the
most
really
constructive
and
indeed
the
most
truly
philosophic
the
whole
thirteenth
century
is
crowded
with
creative
forces
in
philosophy
art
poetry
and
statesmanship
as
rich
as
those
of
the
humanist
and
if
we
are
accustomed
to
look
on
them
as
so
much
more
limited
and
rude
it
is
because
we
forget
how
very
few
and
poor
were
their
resources
and
their
instruments
in
creative
genius
giotto
is
the
peer
if
not
the
superior
of
raphael
dante
had
all
the
qualities
of
his
three
chief
successors
and
very
much
more
besides
it
is
a
tenable
view
that
in
inventive
fertility
and
in
imaginative
range
those
vast
composite
creations
the
cathedrals
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
all
their
wealth
of
architectural
statuary
painted
glass
enamels
embroideries
and
inexhaustible
decorative
work
may
be
set
beside
the
entire
painting
of
the
sixteenth
century
albert
and
aquinas
in
philosophic
range
had
no
peer
until
we
come
down
to
descartes
nor
was
roger
bacon
surpassed
in
versatile
audacity
of
genius
and
in
true
encyclopaedic
grasp
by
any
thinker
between
him
and
his
namesake
the
chancellor
in
statesmanship
and
all
the
qualities
of
the
born
leader
of
men
we
can
only
match
the
great
chiefs
of
the
thirteenth
century
by
comparing
them
with
the
greatest
names
three
or
even
four
centuries
later
now
this
great
century
the
last
of
the
true
middle
ages
which
as
it
drew
to
its
own
end
gave
birth
to
modern
society
has
a
special
character
of
its
own
a
character
that
gives
it
an
abiding
and
enchanting
interest
we
find
in
it
a
harmony
of
power
a
universality
of
endowment
a
glow
an
aspiring
ambition
and
confidence
such
as
we
never
find
in
later
centuries
at
least
so
generally
and
so
permanently
diffused
the
thirteenth
century
was
an
era
of
no
special
character
it
was
in
nothing
and
in
nothing
discordant
it
had
great
thinkers
great
rulers
great
teachers
great
poets
xii
great
artists
great
moralists
and
great
workmen
it
could
not
be
called
the
material
age
the
devotional
age
the
political
age
or
the
poetic
age
in
any
special
degree
it
was
equally
poetic
political
industrial
artistic
practical
intellectual
and
devotional
and
these
qualities
acted
in
harmony
on
a
uniform
conception
of
life
with
a
real
symmetry
of
purpose
there
was
one
common
creed
one
ritual
one
worship
one
sacred
language
one
church
a
single
code
of
manners
a
uniform
scheme
of
society
a
common
system
of
education
an
accepted
type
of
beauty
a
universal
art
something
like
a
recognized
standard
of
the
good
the
beautiful
and
the
true
of
the
world
was
not
occupied
in
ridiculing
or
combating
what
the
other
half
was
doing
nor
were
men
absorbed
in
ideals
of
their
own
while
treating
the
ideals
of
their
neighbors
as
matters
of
indifference
and
waste
of
power
men
as
utterly
different

as
were
stephen

all
profoundly
accepted

of

to
things
of
the
intellect
of
moral
duty
of
action
and
of
the
soul
to
public
and

life
at
once
and
they
could

sterile
and
obscure
as
is
that
portion
of
our
annals
it
is
there
that
we
must
seek
for
the
origin
of
our
freedom
our
prosperity
and
our
glory
then
it
was
that
the
great
english
people
was
formed
that
the
national
character
began
to
exhibit
those
peculiarities
which
it
has
ever
since
retained
and
that
our
fathers
became
emphatically
islanders
islanders
not
merely
in
geographical
position
but
in
their
politics
their
feelings
and
their
manners
then
first
appeared
with
distinctness
that
constitution
which
has
ever
since
through
all
changes
preserved
its
identity
that
constitution
of
which
all
the
other
free
constitutions
in
the
world
are
copies
and
which
in
spite
of
some
defects
deserves
to
be
regarded
as
the
best
under
which
any
great
xiii
society
has
ever
yet
existed
during
many
ages
then
it
was
that
the
house
of
commons
the
archetype
of
all
the
representative
assemblies
which
now
meet
either
in
the
old
or
in
the
new
world
held
its
first
sittings
then
it
was
that
the
common
law
rose
to
the
dignity
of
a
science
and
rapidly
became
a
not
unworthy
rival
of
the
imperial
jurisprudence
then
it
was
that
the
courage
of
those
sailors
who
manned
the
rude
barks
of
the
cinque
ports
first
made
the
flag
of
england
terrible
on
the
seas
then
it
was
that
the
most
ancient
colleges
which
still
exist
at
both
the
great
national
seats
of
learning
were
founded
then
was
formed
that
language
less
musical
indeed
than
the
languages
of
the
south
but
in
force
in
richness

of

the

inferior
to

alone
then
too
appeared
the
first
faint
dawn
of
that
noble
literature
the
most
splendid
and
the
most
durable
of
the
many
glories
of
macaulay
this
time
of
fusion
during
which
all
direct
traces
of
foreign
conquest
were
got
rid
of
was
naturally
the
time
during
which
the
political
and
social
institutions
of
the
country
gradually
took
on
that
form
which
distinguishes
modern
england
the

of
the

from
the
older
england
of
the

years
of
english
history
by
the
time
of
edward
i
though
the
english
tongue
had
not
yet
finally
displaced
french
it
had
assumed
the
main
characters
which
distinguished
its
modern
from
its
ancient
form
in
architecture
a
great
change
had
taken
place
by
which
the
romanesque
style
gave
way
to
the
gothic
the
subordinate
arts
had
taken
prodigious
strides
the
sculpture
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
parted
from
that
of

a
wider
gap

any
that
parts
these

in
law
or
language
in
the
root
of
the
matter
in

itself
those
changes
have
been
made
which
wrought
the
body
politic
of
england
into
a
shape
which
has
left
future
ages
nothing
to
do
but
to
improve
in
italics

in
short
the
great
destructive
and
creative
age
of
europe
and
civilized
asia
passed
over
england
as
it
passed
over
other
lands
the
age
which
saw
the
eastern
empire
fall
beneath
the
arms
of
the
frank
and
the
eastern
caliphate
before
the
arms
of
the
mogul
the
age
which
saw
the
true
power
and
glory
of
the
western
empire
buried
in
the
grave
of
the
wonder
of
the
world
the
age
which
ruled
that
the
warriors
of
the
cross
should
work
their
will
in
spain
and
in
prussia
xiv
and
should
not
work
their
will
in
the
holy
land
itself
the
age
which
made
venice
mistress
of
the
eastern
seas
and
bade
florence
stand
forth
as
the
new
type
of
democratic
freedom
the
age
which
changed
the
nominal
kingship
of
the
lord
of

into
the
mighty

the
moment
when
this
interaction
might
have
seemed
on
the
point
of
reaching
a
complete
and
harmonious
result
was
the
glorious
thirteenth
century
the
culminating
moment
of
the
holy
roman
empire
then
as
in
the
times
of
caesar
or
trajan
there
might
have
seemed
to
be
a
union
among
civilized
men
in
which
the
separate
life
of
individuals
and
localities
was
not
submerged
in
that
golden
age
alike
of
feudal
system
of
empire
and
of
church
there
were
to
be
seen
the
greatest
monarchs
in
fullest
sympathy
with
their
peoples
that
christendom
has
ever
known

edward

then
when
in
the
pontificates
of
innocent
iii
and
his
successors
the
roman
church
reached
its
apogee
the
religious
yearning
of
men
sought
expressions
in
the
sublimest
architecture
the
world
has
seen
then
aquinas
summed
up
in
his
profound
speculations
the
substance
of
catholic
theology
and
while
the
morning
twilight
of
modern
science
might
be
discerned
in
the
treatises
of
roger
bacon
while
wandering
minstrelsy
revealed
the
treasures
of
modern
speech
soon
to
be
wrought
under
the
hands
of
dante
and
chaucer
into
forms
of
exquisite
beauty
the
sacred
fervor
of
the
apostolic
ages
found
itself
renewed
in
the
tender
and
mystic
piety
of
francis
of
assisi
it
was
a
wonderful
time
but
after
all
less
memorable
as
the
culmination
of
medieval
empire
and
medieval
church
than
as
the
dawning
of
the
new
era
in
which
we
live
while
wave
after
wave
of
germanic
colonization
poured
over
romanized
europe
breaking
down
old
boundary
lines
and
working
sudden
and
astonishing
changes
on
the
map
setting
up
in
every
quarter
baronies
dukedoms
and
kingdoms
fermenting
with
vigorous
political
life
while
for
twenty
generations
this
salutary
but
wild
and
dangerous
work
was
going
on
there
was
never
a
moment
when
the
imperial
sway
of
xv
rome
was
quite
set
aside
and
forgotten
there
was
never
a
time
when
union
of
some
sort
was
not
maintained
through
the
dominion
which
the
church
had
established
over
the
european
mind
when
we
duly
consider
this
great
fact
in
its
relations
to
what
went
before
and
what
came
after
it
is
hard
to
find
words
fit
to
express
the
debt
of
gratitude
which
modern
civilization
owes
to
the
roman
catholic
church
when
we
think
of
all
the
work
big
with
promise
of
the
future
that
went
on
in
those
centuries
which
modern
writers
in
their
ignorance
used
once
to
set
apart
and
stigmatize
as
the
dark
ages
when
we
consider
how
the
seeds
of
what
is
noblest
in
modern
life
were
then
painfully
sown
upon
the
soil
which
imperial
rome
had
prepared
when
we
think
of
the
various
work
of
a
gregory
a
benedict
a
boniface
an
alfred
a
charlemagne
we
feel
that
there
is
a
sense
in
which
the
most
brilliant
achievements
of
pagan
antiquity
are
dwarfed
in
comparison
with
these
until
quite
lately
indeed
the
student
of
history
has
had
his
attention
too
narrowly
confined
to
the
ages
that
have
been
for
literature
and
art
the
classical
ages
and
thus
his
sense
of
historical
perspective
has
been
fiske

introduction
the
thirteenth
the
greatest
of
centuries
it
can
not
but
seem
a
paradox
to
say
that
the
thirteenth
was
the
greatest
of
centuries
to
most
people
the
idea
will
appear
at
once
so
preposterous
that
they
may
not
even
care
to
consider
it
a
certain
number
of
course
will
have
their
curiosity
piqued
by
the
thought
that
anyone
should
evolve
so
curious
a
notion
either
of
these
attitudes
of
mind
will
yield
at
once
to
a
more
properly
receptive
mood
if
it
is
recalled
that
the
thirteenth
is
the
century
of
the
gothic
cathedrals
of
the
foundation
of
the
university
of
the
signing
of
magna
charta
and
of
the
origin
of
representative
government
with
something
like
constitutional
guarantees
throughout
the
west
of
europe
the
cathedrals
represent
a
development
in
the
arts
that
has
probably
never
been
equaled
either
before
or
since
the
university
was
a
definite
creation
of
these
generations
that
has
lived
and
maintained
its
usefulness
practically
in
the
same
form
in
which
it
was
then
cast
for
the
seven
centuries
ever
since
the
foundation
stones
of
modern
liberties
are
to
be
found
in
the
documents
which
for
the
first
time
declared
the
rights
of
man
during
this
precious
period
a
little
consideration
of
the
men
who
at
this
period
lived
lives
of
undying
influence
on
mankind
will
still
further
attract
the
attention
of
those
who
have
not
usually
grouped
these
great
characters
together
just
before
the
century
opened
three
great
rulers
died
at
the
height
of
their
influence
they
are
still
and
will
always
be
the
subject
of
men
thoughts
and
of
literature
they
were
frederick
barbarossa
saladin
and
richard
coeur
de
lion
they
formed
but
a
suggestive
prelude
of
what
was
to
come
in
the
following
century
when
such
great
monarchs
as
louis
of
france
ferdinand
of
spain
alfonso
the
wise
of
castile
frederick
ii
of
germany
edward
i
the
english
justinian
rudolph
of
hapsburg
whose
descendants
still
rule
in
austria
and
robert
bruce
occupied
the
thrones
of
europe
was
it
by
chance
or
providence
that
the
same
century
saw
the
rise
of
and
the
beginning
of
the
fall
of
that
great
eastern
monarchy
which
had
been
created
by
the
genius
for
conquest
of
jenghiz
khan
the
tartar
warrior
who
ruled
over
all
the
eastern
world
from
beyond
what
are
now
the
western
confines
of
russia
poland
and
hungary
into
and
including
what
we
now
call
china
but
the
thrones
of
europe
and
of
asia
did
not
monopolize
the
great
men
of
the
time
the
thirteenth
century
claims
such
wonderful
churchmen
as
francis
and
dominic
and
while
it
has
only
the
influence
of
hugh
of
lincoln
who
died
just
as
it
began
it
can
be
proud
of
edmund
of
canterbury
stephen
langton
and
robert
grosseteste
all
men
whose
place
in
history
is
due
to
what
they
did
for
their
people
and
such
magnificent
women
as
queen
blanche
of
castile
clare
of
assisi
and
elizabeth
of
hungary
the
century
opened
with
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
popes
on
the
throne
innocent
iii
and
it
closed
with
the
most
misunderstood
of
popes
who
is
in
spite
of
this
one
of
the
worthiest
successors
of
peter
boniface
viii
during
the
century
there
had
been
such
men
as
honorius
iv
the
patron
of
learning
gregory
ix
to
whom
canon
law
owes
so
much
and
john
xxi
who
had
been
famous
as
a
scientist
before
becoming
pope
there
are
such
scholars
as
thomas
of
aquin
albertus
magnus
roger
bacon
bonaventure
duns
scotus
raymond
lully
vincent
of
beauvais
and
alexander
of
hales
and
such
patrons
of
learning
as
robert
of
sorbonne
and
the
founders
of
nearly
twenty
universities
there
were
such
artists
as
gaddi
cimabue
and
above
all
giotto
and
such
literary
men
as
the
authors
of
the
arthur
legends
and
the
nibelungen
the
meistersingers
the
minnesingers
the
troubadours
and
trouvères
and
above
all
dante
who
is
universally
considered
now
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
literary
men
of
all
times
but
who
was
not
as
is
so
often
thought
and
said
a
solitary
phenomenon
in
the
period
but
only
the
culmination
of
a
great
literary
movement
that
had
to
have
some
such
supreme
expression
of
itself
as
this
in
order
to
properly
round
out
the
cycle
of
its
existence
if
in
addition
it
be
said
that
this
century
saw
the
birth
of
the
democratic
spirit
in
many
different
ways
in
the
various
countries
of
europe
but
always
in
such
form
that
it
was
never
quite
to
die
out
again
the
reasons
for
talking
of
it
as
possibly
the
greatest
of
centuries
will
be
readily
appreciated
even
by
those
whose
reading
has
not
given
them
any
preliminary
basis
of
information
with
regard
to
this
period
which
has
unfortunately
been
shrouded
from
the
eyes
of
most
people
by
the
fact
that
its
place
in
the
midst
of
the
middle
ages
would
seem
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
the
idea
that
it
could
represent
a
great
phase
of
the
development
of
the
human
intellect
and
its
esthetic
possibilities
there
would
seem
to
be
one
more
or
less
insuperable
objection
to
the
consideration
of
the
thirteenth
as
the
greatest
of
centuries
and
that
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
idea
of
evolution
has
consciously
and
unconsciously
tinged
the
thoughts
of
our
generation
to
such
a
degree
that
it
seems
almost
impossible
to
think
of
a
period
so
far
in
the
distant
past
as
having
produced
results
comparable
with
those
that
naturally
flow
from
the
heightened
development
of
a
long
subsequent
epoch
whatever
of
truth
there
may
be
in
the
great
theory
of
evolution
however
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
no
added
evidence
for
its
acceptance
can
be
obtained
from
the
intellectual
history
of
the
human
race
we
may
be
the
heirs
of
all
the
ages
in
the
foremost
files
of
time
but
one
thing
is
certain
that
we
can
scarcely
hope
to
equal
and
do
not
at
all
think
of
surpassing
some
of
the
great

of
long

apparently
there
is
very
little
if
any
evolution
homer
wrote
nearly
three
thousand
years
ago
as
supreme
an
expression
of
human
life
in
absolute
literary
values
as
the
world
has
ever
known
or
with
all
reverence
for
the
future
be
it
said
is
ever
likely
to
know
the
great
dramatic
poem
job
emanated
from
a
hebrew
poet
in
those
earlier
times
and
yet
if
judged
from
the
standpoint
of
mere
literature
is
as
surpassing
an
expression
of
human
intelligence
in
the
presence
of
the
mystery
of
evil
as
has
ever
come
from
the
mind
of
man
we
are
no
nearer
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
evil
in
life
though
thousands
of
years
have
passed
and
man
has
been
much
occupied
with
the
thoughts
that
disturbed
the
mind
of
the
ruler
of
moab
the
code
of
hammurabi
recently
discovered
has
shown
very
definitely
that
men
could
make
laws
nearly
five
thousand
years
ago
as
well
calculated
to
correct
human
abuses
as
those
our
legislators
spend
so
much
time
over
at
present
and
the
olden
time
laws
were
probably
quite
as
effective
as
ours
can
hope
to
be
for
all
our
well
intentioned
purpose
and
praiseworthy
efforts
at
reform
it
used
to
be
a
favorite
expression
of
virchow
the
great
german
pathologist
who
was
besides
however
the
greatest
of
living
anthropologists
that
from
the
history
of
the
human
race
the
theory
of
evolution
receives
no
confirmation
of
any
kind
his
favorite
subject
the
study
of
skulls
and
their
conformation
in
the
five
thousand
years
through
which
such
remains
could
be
traced
showed
him
absolutely
no
change
for
him
there
had
been
also
no
development
in
the
intellectual
order
in
human
life
during
the
long
period
of
human
history
of
course
this
is
comparatively
brief
if
the
long
aeons
of
geological
times
be
considered
yet
some
development
might
be
expected
to
manifest
itself
in
the
more
than
two
hundred
generations
that
have
come
and
gone
since
the
beginning
of
human
memory
perhaps
then
the
prejudice
with
regard
to
evolution
and
its
supposed
effectiveness
in
making
the
men
of
more
recent
times
superior
to
those
of
the
past
may
be
considered
to
have
very
little
weight
as
an
objection
to
the
consideration
of
the
thirteenth
century
as
representing
the
highest
stage
in
human
accomplishment
so
far
as
scientific
anthropology
goes
there
is
utter
indifference
as
to
the
period
that
may
be
selected
as
representing
man
at
his
best
to
most
people
the
greater
portion
of
surprise
with
regard
to
the
assertion
of
the
thirteenth
as
the
greatest
of
centuries
will
be
the
fact
that
the
period
thus
picked
out
is
almost
in
the
heart
of
the
middle
ages
it
would
be
not
so
amazing
if
the
fifth
century
before
christ
which
produced
such
marvelous
accomplishments
in
letters
and
art
and
philosophy
among
the
greeks
was
chosen
as
the
greatest
of
human
epochs
there
might
not
even
be
so
much
of
unpreparedness
of
mind
if
that
supreme
century
of
roman
history
from
fifty
years
before
christ
to
fifty
years
after
were
picked
out
for
such
signal
notice
illustration
virgin

the
divine
child
mosaic
mark

we
have
grown
accustomed
however
to
think
of
the
middle
ages
as
hopelessly
backward
in
the
opportunities
they
afforded
men
for
the
expression
of
their
intellectual
and
artistic
faculties
and
above
all
for
any
development
of
that
human
liberty
which
means
so
much
for
the
happiness
of
the
race
and
must
constitute
the
basis
of
any
real
advance
worth
while
talking
about
in
human
affairs
it
is
this
that
would
make
the
thirteenth
century
seem
out
of
place
in
any
comparative
study
for
the
purpose
of
determining
proportionate
epochal
greatness
the
spirit
breathes
where
it
will
however
and
there
was
a
mighty
wind
of
the
spirit
of
human
progress
abroad
in
that
thirteenth
century
whose
effects
usually
miss
proper
recognition
in
history
because
people
fail
to
group
together
in
their
minds
all
the
influences
in
our
modern
life
that
come
to
us
from
that
precious
period
all
this
present
volume
pretends
to
do
is
to
gather
these
scattered
details
of
influence
in
order
to
make
the
age
in
which
they
all
coincided
so
wonderfully
be
properly
appreciated
if
we
accept
the
usual
historical
division
which
places
the
middle
ages
during
the
thousand
years
between
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
in
the
fifth
century
and
the
fall
of
the
grecian
empire
of
constantinople
about
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
the
thirteenth
century
must
be
considered
the
culmination
of
that
middle
age
it
is
three
centuries
before
the
renaissance
and
to
most
minds
that
magical
word
represents
the
beginning
of
all
that
is
modern
and
therefore
all
that
is
best
in
the
world
most
people
forget
entirely
how
much
of
progress
had
been
made
before
the
renaissance
and
how
many
great
writers
and
artists
had
been
fostering
the
taste
and
developing
the
intelligence
of
the
people
of
italy
long
before
the
fall
of
constantinople
the
renaissance
after
all
means
only
the
of
greek
ideas
and
ideals
of
greek
letters
and
arts
into
the
modern
world
if
this
new
birth
of
greek
esthetics
had
not
found
the
soil
thoroughly
prepared
by
the
fruitful
labor
of
three
centuries
before
history
would
not
have
seen
any
such
outburst
of
artistic
and
literary
accomplishments
as
actually
came
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
and
during
the
sixteenth
centuries
in
taking
up
the
thesis
the
thirteenth
the
greatest
of
centuries
it
seems
absolutely
necessary
to
define
just
what
is
meant
by
the
term
great
in
its
application
to
a
period
an
historical
epoch
most
people
would
concede
at
once
is
really
great
just
in
proportion
to
the
happiness
which
it
provides
for
the
largest
possible
number
of
humanity
that
period
is
greatest
that
has
done
most
to
make
men
happy
happiness
consists
in
the
opportunity
to
express
whatever
is
best
in
us
and
above
all
to
find
utterance
for
whatever
is
individual
an
essential
element
in
it
is
the
opportunity
to
develop
and
apply
the
intellectual
faculties
whether
this
be
of
purely
artistic
or
of
thoroughly
practical
character
for
such
happiness
the
opportunity
to
rise
above
one
original
station
is
one
of
the
necessary
requisites
out
of
these
opportunities
there
comes
such
contentment
as
is
possible
to
man
in
the
imperfect
existence
that
is
his
under
present
conditions
almost
as
important
a
quality
in
any
epoch
that
is
to
be
considered
supremely
great
is
the
difference
between
the
condition
of
men
at
the
beginning
of
it
and
at
its
conclusion
the
period
that
represents
most
progress
even
though
at
the
end
uplift
should
not
have
reached
a
degree
equal
to
subsequent
periods
must
be
considered
as
having
best
accomplished
its
duty
to
the
race
for
purposes
of
comparison
it
is
the
amount
of
ground
actually
covered
in
a
definite
time
rather
than
the
comparative
position
at
the
end
of
it
that
deserves
to
be
taken
into
account
this
would
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
hedging
as
if
the
terms
of
the
comparison
of
the
thirteenth
with
other
centuries
were
to
be
made
more
favorable
by
the
establishment
of
different
standards
there
is
however
no
need
of
any
such
makeshift
in
order
to
establish
the
actual
supremacy
of
the
thirteenth
century
since
it
can
well
afford
to
be
estimated
on
its
own
merits
alone
and
without
any
allowances
because
of
the
stage
of
cultural
development
at
which
it
occurred
john
ruskin
once
said
that
a
proper
estimation
of
the
accomplishments
of
a
period
in
human
history
can
only
be
obtained
by
careful
study
of
three
books
the
book
of
the
deeds
the
book
of
the
arts
and
the
book
of
the
words
of
the
given
epoch
the
thirteenth
century
may
be
promptly
ready
for
this
judgment
of
what
it
accomplished
for
men
of
what
it
wrote
for
subsequent
generations
and
of
the
artistic
qualities
to
be
found
in
its
art
remains
in
the
book
of
the
deeds
of
the
century
what
is
especially
important
is
what
was
accomplished
for
men
that
is
what
the
period
did
for
the
education
of
the
people
not
alone
the
classes
but
the
masses
and
what
a
precious
heritage
of
liberty
and
of
social
coordination
it
left
behind
to
most
people
it
will
appear
at
once
that
if
the
most
important
chapter
of
thirteenth
century
accomplishment
is
to
be
found
in
the
book
of
its
deeds
and
the
deeds
are
to
be
judged
according
to
the
standard
just
given
of
education
and
liberty
then
there
will
be
no
need
to
seek
further
since
these
are
words
for
which
it
is
supposed
that
there
is
no
actual
equivalent
in
human
life
and
history
for
at
least
several
centuries
after
the
close
of
the
thirteenth
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
it
is
in
this
very
chapter
that
the
thirteenth
century
will
be
found
strongest
in
its
claim
to
true
greatness
the
thirteenth
century
saw
the
foundation
of
the
universities
and
their
gradual
development
into
the
institutions
of
learning
which
we
have
at
the
present
time
those
scholars
of
the
thirteenth
century
recognized
that
for
its
own
development
and
for
practical
purposes
the
human
intellect
can
best
be
trained
along
certain
lines
for
its
preliminary
training
it
seemed
to
them
to
need
what
has
since
come
to
be
called
the
liberal
arts
that
is
a
knowledge
of
certain
languages
and
of
logic
as
well
as
a
thorough
consideration
of
the
great
problems
of
the
relation
of
man
to
his
creator
to
his
and
to
the
universe
around
him
grammar
a
much
wider
subject
than
we
now
include
under
the
term
and
philosophy
constituted
the
undergraduate
studies
of
the
universities
of
the
thirteenth
century
for
the
practical
purposes
of
life
a
division
of
study
had
to
be
made
so
as
to
suit
the
life
design
of
each
individual
and
accordingly
the
faculties
of
theology
for
the
training
of
divines
of
medicine
for
the
training
of
physicians
and
of
law
for
the
training
of
advocates
came
into
existence
we
shall
consider
this
subject
in
more
detail
in
a
subsequent
chapter
but
it
will
be
clear
at
once
that
the
university
as
organized
by
these
wise
generations
of
the
thirteenth
century
has
come
down
unchanged
to
us
in
the
modern
time
we
still
have
practically
the
same
methods
of
preliminary
training
and
the
same
division
of
studies
we
specialize
to
a
greater
degree
than
they
did
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
specialism
was
not
unknown
by
any
means
in
the
thirteenth
century
though
there
were
fewer
opportunities
for
its
practical
application
to
the
things
of
life
if
this
century
had
done
nothing
else
but
create
the
instrument
by
which
the
human
mind
has
ever
since
been
trained
it
must
be
considered
as
deserving
a
place
of
the
very
highest
rank
in
the
periods
of
human
history
it
is
however
much
more
for
what
it
accomplished
for
the
education
of
the
masses
than
for
the
institutions
it
succeeded
in
developing
for
the
training
of
the
classes
that
the
thirteenth
century
merits
a
place
in
the
roll
of
fame
this
declaration
will
doubtless
seem
utterly
paradoxical
to
the
ordinary
reader
of
history
we
are
very
prone
to
consider
that
it
is
only
in
our
time
that
anything
like
popular
education
has
come
into
existence
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
the
education
afforded
to
the
people
in
the
little
towns
of
the
middle
ages
represents
an
ideal
of
educational
uplift
for
the
masses
such
as
has
never
been
even
distantly
approached
in
succeeding
centuries
the
thirteenth
century
developed
the
greatest
set
of
technical
schools
that
the
world
has
ever
known
the
technical
school
is
supposed
to
be
a
creation
of
the
last
half
century
at
the
outside
these
medieval
towns
however
during
the
course
of
the
building
of
their
cathedrals
of
their
public
buildings
and
various
magnificent
edifices
of
royalty
and
for
the
nobility
succeeded
in
accomplishing
such
artistic
results
that
the
world
has
ever
since
held
them
in
admiration
and
that
this
admiration
has
increased
rather
than
diminished
with
the
development
of
taste
in
very
recent
years
nearly
every
one
of
the
most
important
towns
of
england
during
the
thirteenth
century
was
erecting
a
cathedral
altogether
some
twenty
cathedrals
remain
as
the
subject
of
loving
veneration
and
of
frequent
visitation
for
the
modern
generation
there
was
intense
rivalry
between
these
various
towns
each
tried
to
surpass
the
other
in
the
grandeur
of
its
cathedral
and
auxiliary
buildings
instead
of
lending
workmen
to
one
another
there
was
a
civic
pride
in
accomplishing
for
one
native
town
whatever
was
best
illustration
pulpit
pisano
siena
each
of
these
towns
then
none
of
which
had
more
than
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
except
london
and
even
that
scarcely
more
had
to
develop
its
own
for
itself
that
they
succeeded
in
doing
so
demonstrates
a
great
educational
influence
at
work
in
arts
and
crafts
in
each
of
these
towns
we
scarcely
succeed
in
obtaining
such
trained
workmen
in
proportionately
much
fewer
numbers
even
with
the
aid
of
our
technical
schools
and
while
these
thirteenth
century
people
did
not
think
of
such
a
term
it
is
evident
that
they
had
the
reality
and
that
they
were
able
to
develop
artistic
handicraftsmen
the
best
the
world
has
ever
known
with
all
this
of
education
abroad
in
the
lands
it
is
not
surprising
that
great
results
should
have
flowed
from
human
efforts
and
that
these
should
prove
enduring
even
down
to
our
own
time
accomplishments
of
the
highest
significance
were
necessarily
bound
up
with
opportunities
for
so
tempting
and
so
complete
as
those
provided
for
the
generations
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
books
of
the
words
as
well
as
of
the
arts
of
the
thirteenth
century
will
be
found
eminently
interesting
and
no
period
has
ever
furnished
so
many
examples
of
wondrous
initiative
followed
almost
immediately
by
just
as
marvelous
progress
and
eventual
approach
to
as
near
perfection
as
it
is
perhaps
possible
to
come
in
things
human
ordinarily
literary
origins
are
not
known
with
sufficient
certainty
as
to
dates
for
any
but
the
professional
scholar
to
realize
the
scope
of
the
century
literature
only
a
very
little
consideration
however
is
needed
to
demonstrate
how
thoroughly
representative
of
what
is
most
enduring
in
literary
expression
in
modern
times
are
the
works
in
every
country
that
had
origin
in
this
century
there
was
not
a
single
country
in
civilized
europe
which
did
not
contribute
its
quota
and
that
of
great
significance
to
the
literary
movement
of
the
time
in
spain
there
came
the
cid
and
certain
accompanying
products
of
ballad
poetry
which
form
the
basis
of
the
national
literature
and
are
still
read
not
only
by
scholars
and
amateurs
but
even
by
the
people
generally
because
of
the
supreme
human
interest
in
them
in
england
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
saw
the
putting
into
shape
of
the
arthur
legends
in
the
form
in
which
they
were
to
appeal
most
nearly
to
subsequent
generations
walter
map
work
in
these
was
as
we
shall
see
one
of
the
great
literary
accomplishments
of
all
time
subsequent
treatments
of
the
same
subject
are
only
slight
modifications
of
the
theme
which
he
elaborated
and
mallory
and
spenser
and
even
our
own
work
derive
their
interest
from
the
humanly
sympathetic
story
written
so
close
to
the
heart
of
nature
in
the
thirteenth
century
that
it
will
always
prove
attractive
in
germany
just
at
the
same
time
the
was
receiving
the
form
in
which
it
was
to
live
as
the
great
national
epic
the
meistersingers
also
were
accomplishing
their
supreme
work
of
christianizing
and
modernizing
the
old
german
and
christian
legends
which
were
to
prove
such
a
precious
heritage
of
interest
for
posterity
in
the
south
of
germany
the
minnesingers
sang
their
tuneful
strains
and
showed
how
possible
it
was
to
take
the
cruder
language
of
the
north
and
pour
forth
as
melodious
hymns
of
praise
to
nature
and
to
their
beloved
ones
as
in
the
more
fluent
southern
tongues
most
of
this
was
done
in
the
old
suabian
high
german
dialect
and
the
basis
of
the
modern
german
language
was
thus
laid
the
low
german
was
to
prove
the
vehicle
for
the
original
form
of
the
animal
epic
or
stories
with
regard
to
reynard
the
fox
which
were
to
prove
so
popular
throughout
all
of
europe
for
all
time
thereafter
in
north
france
the
trouvères
were
accomplishing
a
similar
work
to
that
of
the
minnesingers
in
south
germany
but
doing
it
with
an
original
genius
a
refinement
of
style
characteristic
of
their
nation
and
a
finish
of
form
that
was
to
impress
itself
upon
french
literature
for
all
subsequent
time
here
also
jean
de
meun
and
guillaume
de
lorris
wrote
the
romance
of
the
rose
which
was
to
remain
the
most
popular
book
in
europe
down
to
the
age
of
printing
and
for
some
time
thereafter
at
the
south
of
france
the
work
of
the
troubadours
similar
to
that
of
the
trouvères
and
yet
with
a
spirit
and
character
all
its
own
was
creating
a
type
of
love
songs
that
the
world
recurs
to
with
pleasure
whenever
the
lyrical
aspect
of
poetry
becomes
fashionable
the
influence
of
the
troubadours
was
to
be
felt
in
italy
and
before
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
there
were
many
writers
of
short
poems
that
deserve
a
place
in
what
is
best
in
literature
men
like
sordello
guido
cavalcanti
cino
da
pistoia
and
dante
da
maiano
deserve
mention
in
any
historical
review
of
literature
quite
apart
from
the
influence
which
they
had
on
their
great
successor
the
prince
of
italian
poets
and
one
of
the
immortal
trio
of
the
world
supreme
creative
singers
dante
alighieri
with
what
must
have
seemed
the
limit
of
conceit
he
placed
himself
among
the
six
greatest
poets
but
posterity
breathes
his
name
only
with
those
of
homer
and
shakespeare
dante
in
spite
of
his
giant
personality
and
sublime
poetic
genius
is
not
an
exception
nor
a
solitary
phenomenon
in
the
course
of
the
century
but
only
a
worthy
culmination
of
the
literary
movement
which
beginning
in
the
distant
west
in
spain
and
england
gradually
worked
eastward
quite
contrary
to
the
usual
trend
of
human
development
and
inspired
its
greatest
work
in
the
musical
tuscan
dialect
after
having
helped
in
the
foundation
of
all
the
other
modern
languages
dante
is
the
supreme
type
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
child
of
his
age
but
the
great
master
whom
medieval
influences
have
made
all
that
he
is
that
he
belongs
to
the
century
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
of
himself
alone
he
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
lift
any
period
out
of
obscurity
and
place
it
among
the
favorite
epochs
in
which
the
human
mind
found
one
of
those
opportune
moments
for
the
expression
of
what
is
sublimest
in
human
thought
it
is
however
the
bock
of
the
arts
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
deserves
most
to
be
thumbed
by
the
modern
reader
intent
on
learning
something
of
this
marvelous
period
of
human
existence
there
is
not
a
single
branch
of
art
in
which
the
men
of
this
generation
did
not
accomplish
excelling
things
that
have
been
favorite
subjects
for
study
and
loving
imitation
ever
since
perhaps
the
most
marvelous
quality
of
the
grand
old
gothic
cathedrals
erected
during
the
thirteenth
century
is
not
their
impressiveness
as
a
whole
so
much
as
their
wonderful
finish
in
detail
it
matters
not
what
element
of
construction
or
decoration
be
taken
into
consideration
always
there
is
an
approach
to
perfection
in
accomplishment
in
some
one
of
the
cathedrals
that
shows
with
what
thoroughness
the
men
of
the
time
comprehended
what
was
best
in
art
and
how
finally
their
strivings
after
perfection
were
rewarded
as
bountifully
as
perhaps
it
has
ever
been
given
to
men
to
realize
of
the
major
arts
architecture
itself
sculpture
and
painting
only
a
word
will
be
said
here
since
they
will
be
treated
more
fully
in
subsequent
chapters
no
more
perfect
effort
at
worthy
worship
of
the
most
high
has
ever
been
accomplished
than
is
to
be
seen
in
the
gothic
cathedrals
in
every
country
in
europe
as
they
exist
to
the
present
day
while
the
movement
began
in
north
france
and
gradually
spread
to
other
countries
there
was
never
any
question
of
mere
slavish
imitation
but
on
the
contrary
in
each
country
gothic
architecture
took
on
a
national
character
and
developed
into
a
charming
expression
of
the
special
characteristics
of
the
people
for
whom
and
by
whom
it
was
made
english
gothic
is
of
course
quite
different
to
that
of
france
spanish
gothic
has
a
character
all
its
own
the
german
gothic
cathedrals
partake
of
the
heavier
characteristics
of
the
northern
people
while
italian
gothic
adds
certain
airy
decorative
qualities
to
the
french
model
that
give
renewed
interest
and
inevitably
indicate
the
origin
of
the
structures
in
painting
cimabue
work
so
wonderfully
appreciated
by
the
people
of
florence
that
spontaneously
they
flocked
in
procession
to
do
honor
to
his
great
picture
was
the
beginning
of
modern
art
how
much
was
accomplished
before
the
end
of
the
century
will
be
best
appreciated
when
the
name
of
giotto
is
mentioned
as
the
culmination
of
the
art
movement
of
the
century
as
we
shall
see
the
work
done
by
him
especially
at
assisi
has
been
a
source
of
inspiration
for
artists
down
even
to
our
own
time
and
there
are
certain
qualities
of
his
art
especially
his
faculty
for
producing
the
feeling
of
solidity
in
his
paintings
in
which
very
probably
he
has
never
been
surpassed
gothic
cathedrals
in
other
countries
did
not
lend
themselves
so
well
as
subjects
of
inspiration
for
decorative
art
but
in
every
country
the
sacred
books
in
use
in
the
cathedral
were
adorned
at
the
command
of
the
artistic
impulse
of
the
period
in
a
way
that
has
made
the
illuminated
missals
and
office
books
of
the
thirteenth
century
perhaps
the
most
precious
that
there
are
in
the
history
of

it
might
be
thought
that
in
sculpture
at
least
these
generations
would
prove
to
be
below
the
level
of
that
perfection
and
artistic
expression
which
came
so
assuredly
in
other
lines
it
is
true
that
most
of
the
sculptures
of
the
period
have
defects
that
make
them
unworthy
of
imitation
though
it
is
in
the
matter
of
technique
that
they
fail
rather
than
in
honest
effort
to
express
feelings
appropriately
within
the
domain
of
chiseled
work
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
supreme
examples
of
what
is
best
in
sculpture
to
be
found
among
the
adornments
of
the
cathedrals
of
the
period
no
more
simply
dignified
rendition
of
the
god
man
has
ever
been
made
in
stone
than
the
statue
of
christ
which
with
such
charming
appropriateness
the
people
of
amiens
have
called
beau
their
beautiful
god
and
that
visitors
to
their
great
cathedral
can
never
admire
sufficiently
admirably
set
off
as
it
is
in
its
beautiful
situation
above
the
main
door
of
the
great
cathedral
other
examples
are
not
lacking
as
for
instance
some
of
the
effigies
of
the
french
kings
and
queens
at
denis
and
some
of
the
wonderful
sculptures
at
rheims
in
its
place
as
a
subsidiary
art
to
architecture
for
decorative
purposes
sculpture
was
even
more
eminently
successful
the
best
example
of
this
is
the
famous
angel
choir
of
lincoln
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
that
ever
came
from
the
hand
of
man
and
whose
designation
indicates
the
belief
of
the
centuries
that
only
the
angels
could
have
made
it
in
the
handicrafts
most
nearly
allied
to
the
arts
the
thirteenth
century
reigns
supreme
with
a
splendor
unapproached
by
what
has
been
accomplished
in
any
other
century
the
iron
work
of
their
gates
and
railings
even
of
their
hinges
and
latches
and
locks
has
been
admired
and
imitated
by
many
generations
since
when
a
piece
of
it
is
no
longer
of
use
or
loosens
from
the
crumbling
woodwork
to
which
it
was
attached
it
is
straightway
transported
to
some
museum
there
to
be
displayed
not
alone
for
its
antiquarian
interest
but
also
as
a
model
and
a
suggestion
to
the
modern
designer
this
same
thing
is
true
of
the
precious
metal
work
of
the
times
also
at
least
as
regards
the
utensils
and
ornaments
employed
in
the
sacred
services
the
chalices
and
other
sacred
vessels
were
made
on
severely
simple
lines
and
according
to
models
which
have
since
become
the
types
of
such
sacred
utensils
for
all
times
the
vestments
used
in
the
sacred
ceremonials
partook
of
this
same
character
of
eminently
appropriate
handiwork
united
to
the
chastest
of
designs
executed
with
supreme
taste
the
famous
cope
of
ascoli
which
the
recent
pierpont
morgan
incident
brought
into
prominence
a
year
or
so
ago
is
a
sample
of
the
needlework
of
the
times
that
illustrates
its
perfection
it
is
said
by
those
who
are
authorities
in
the
matter
that
needlework
represents
what
is
best
in
this
line
it
is
not
the
most
elaborate
nor
the
most
showy
but
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
best
taste
supremely
suitable
to
the
objects
of
which
it
formed
a
part
it
is
after
all
only
an
almost
inevitable
appendix
to
the
beautiful
work
done
in
the
illumination
of
the
sacred
books
that
the
sacred
vestments
should
have
been
quite
as
supremely
artistic
and
just
as
much
triumphs
of
art
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
minutest
detail
of
cathedral
construction
and
ornamentation
shared
in
this
artistic
triumph
even
the
inscriptions
done
in
brass
upon
the
gravestones
that
formed
part
of
the
cathedral
pavements
are
models
of
their
kind
and
rubbings
from
them
are
frequently
taken
because
of
their
marvelous
effectiveness
as
designs
in
gothic
tracery
their
bells
were
made
with
such
care
and
such
perfection
that
down
to
the
present
time
nothing
better
has
been
accomplished
in
this
handicraft
and
their
marvelous
retention
of
tone
shows
how
thorough
was
the
work
of
these
early
the
triumph
of
artistic
decoration
in
the
cathedrals
however
and
the
most
marvelous
page
in
the
book
of
the
arts
of
the
century
remains
to
be
spoken
of
in
their
magnificent
windows
where
they
learned
their
secret
of
we
know
not
artists
of
the
modern
time
who
have
spent
years
in
trying
to
perfect
their
own
work
in
this
line
would
give
anything
to
have
some
of
the
secrets
of
the
of
the
thirteenth
century
such
windows
as
the
five
sisters
at
york
or
the
wonderful
jesse
window
of
chartres
with
some
of
its
companions
are
the
despair
of
the
modern
artists
in
stained
glass
the
fact
that
their
was
not
done
at
one
or
even
a
few
common
centers
but
was
apparently
executed
in
each
of
these
small
medieval
towns
that
were
the
site
of
a
cathedral
only
adds
to
the
marvel
of
how
the
workmen
of
the
time
succeeded
so
well
in
accomplishing
their
purpose
of
solving
the
difficult
problems
of

glasswork

if
to
crown
all
that
has
been
said
about
the
thirteenth
century
we
now
add
a
brief
account
of
what
was
accomplished
for
men
in
the
matter
of
liberty
and
the
establishment
of
legal
rights
we
shall
have
a
reasonably
adequate
introduction
to
this
great
subject
liberty
is
thought
to
be
a
word
whose
true
significance
is
of
much
more
recent
origin
than
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
the
rights
of
men
are
usually
supposed
to
have
received
serious
acknowledgment
only
in
comparatively
recent
centuries
the
recalling
of
a
few
facts
however
will
dispel
this
illusion
and
show
how
these
men
of
the
later
middle
age
laid
the
foundation
of
most
of
the
rights
and
privileges
that
we
are
so
proud
to
consider
our
birthright
in
this
modern
time
the
first
great
fact
in
the
history
of
modern
liberty
is
the
signing
of
magna
charta
which
took
place
only
a
little
after
the
middle
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
movement
that
led
up
to
it
had
arisen
amongst
the
guildsmen
as
well
as
the
churchmen
and
the
nobles
of
the
preceding
century
when
the
document
was
signed
however
these
men
did
not
consider
that
their
work
was
finished
they
kept
themselves
ready
to
take
further
advantage
of
the
necessities
of
their
rulers
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
had
secured
political
as
well
as
legal
rights
shortly
after
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
first
english
parliament
met
and
in
the
latter
part
of
that
half
century
it
became
a
formal
institution
with
regularly
appointed
times
of
meeting
and
definite
duties
and
privileges
then
began
the
era
of
law
in
its
modern
sense
for
the
english
people
the
english
common
law
took
form
and
its
great
principles
were
enunciated
practically
in
the
terms
in
which
they
are
stated
down
to
the
present
day
bracton
made
his
famous
digest
of
the
english
common
law
for
the
use
of
judges
and
lawyers
and
it
became
a
standard
work
of
reference
such
it
has
remained
down
to
our
own
time
at
the
end
of
the
century
during
the
reign
of
edward
i
the
english
justinian
the
laws
of
the
land
were
formulated
lacunae
in
legislation
filled
up
rights
and
privileges
fully
determined
laws
put
on
a
modern
basis
and
the
most
important
portions
of
english
law
became
realities
that
were
to
be
modified
but
not
essentially
changed
in
all
the
after
time
this
history
of
liberty
and
of
so
familiar
with
regard
to
england
must
be
repeated
almost
literally
with
regard
to
the
continental
nations
in
france
the
foundation
of
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
were
laid
during
the
reign
of
louis
ix
and
french
authorities
in
the
history
of
law
point
with
pride
to
how
deeply
and
broadly
the
foundations
of
french
jurisprudence
were
laid
under
louis
cousin
ferdinand
iii
of
castile
who
like
the
french
monarch
has
received
the
title
of
saint
because
of
the
uprightness
of
his
character
and
all
that
he
did
for
his
people
forgetful
of
himself
the
foundations
of
spanish
law
were
laid
and
it
is
to
that
time
that
spanish
jurists
trace
the
origin
of
nearly
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
their
people
in
germany
there
is
a
corresponding
story
in
saxony
there
was
the
issue
of
a
famous
book
of
laws
which
represented
all
the
grants
of
the
sovereigns
and
all
the
claims
of
subjects
that
had
been
admitted
by
monarchs
up
to
that
time
in
a
word
everywhere
there
was
a
codification
of
laws
and
a
laying
of
foundations
in
jurisprudence
upon
which
the
modern
superstructure
of
law
was
to
rise
this
is
probably
the
most
surprising
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
when
it
began
men
below
the
rank
of
nobles
were
practically
slaves
whatever
rights
they
had
were
uncertain
liable
to
frequent
violation
because
of
their
indefinite
character
and
any
generation
might
under
the
tyranny
of
some
consciousless
monarch
have
lost
even
the
few
privileges
they
had
enjoyed
before
at
the
close
of
the
thirteenth
century
this
was
no
longer
possible
the
laws
had
been
written
down
and
monarchs
were
bound
by
them
as
well
as
their
subjects
individual
caprice
might
no
longer
deprive
them
arbitrarily
of
their
rights
and
hard
won
privileges
though
tyranny
might
still
assert
itself
and
a
submissive
generation
might
for
a
time
allow
themselves
to
be
governed
by
measures
beyond
the
domain
of
legal
justification
any
subsequent
generation
might
however
begin
anew
its
assertion
of
its
rights
from
the
laws
rather
than
from
the
position
to
which
their
forbears
had
been
reduced
by
a
tyrant
whim
is
it
any
wonder
then
that
we
should
call
the
generations
that
gave
us
the
cathedrals
the
universities
the
great
technical
schools
that
were
organized
by
the
trades
guilds
the
great
national
literatures
that
lie
at
the
basis
of
all
our
modern
literature
the
beginnings
of
sculpture
and
of
art
carried
to
such
heights
that
artistic
principles
were
revealed
for
all
time
and
finally
the
great
men
and
women
of
this
century
for
more
than
any
other
it
glories
in
names
that
were
born
not
to
die
is
it
at
all
surprising
that
we
should
claim
for
the
period
which
in
addition
to
all
this
saw
the
foundation
of
modern
law
and
liberty
the
right
to
be
hailed

at

how

the

anything

there
is
absolutely
no
period
of
equal
length
in
the
history
of
mankind
in
which
so
much
was
not
only
attempted
but
successfully
accomplished
for
education
in
every
sense
of
the
word
as
during
the
thirteenth
century
this
included
not
only
the
education
of
the
classes
but
also
the
education
of
the
masses
for
the
moment
we
shall
concern
ourselves
only
with
the
education
offered
to
and
taken
advantage
of
by
so
many
in
the
universities
of
the
time
it
was
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
the
great
universities
came
into
being
as
schools
in
which
all
the
ordinary
forms
of
learning
were
taught
during
the
twelfth
century
bologna
had
had
a
famous
school
of
law
which
attracted
students
from
all
over
europe
under
irnerius
canon
and
civil
law
secured
a
popularity
as
subjects
of
study
such
as
they
never
had
before
the
study
of
the
old
roman
law
brought
back
with
it
an
interest
in
the
latin
classics
and
the
beginning
of
the
true
new
birth
the
real
renaissance
of
modern
education
must
be
traced
from
here
at
paris
there
was
a
theological
school
attached
to
the
cathedral
which
gradually
became
noted
for
its
devotion
to
philosophy
as
the
basis
of
theology
and
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
attracted
students
from
every
part
of
the
civilized
world
as
was
the
case
at
bologna
interest
after
a
time
was
not
limited
to
philosophy
and
theology
other
branches
of
study
were
admitted
to
the
curriculum
and
a
university
in
the
modern
sense
came
into
existence
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
both
of
these
schools
developed
faculties
for
the
teaching
of
all
the
known
branches
of
knowledge
at
bologna
faculties
of
arts
of
philosophy
and
theology
and
finally
of
medicine
were
gradually
added
and
students
flocked
in
ever
increasing
numbers
to
take
advantage
of
these
additional
opportunities
at
paris
the
school
of
medicine
was
established
early
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
there
were
graduates
in
medicine
before
the
year
law
came
later
but
was
limited
to
canon
law
to
a
great
extent
orleans
having
a
monopoly
of
civil
law
for
more
than
a
century
these
two
universities
bologna
and
paris
were
in
every
sense
of
the
word
early
in
the
century
real
universities
differing
in
no
essential
from
our
modern
institutions
that
bear
the
same
name
if
the
thirteenth
century
had
done
nothing
else
but
put
into
shape
this
great
instrument
for
the
training
of
the
human
mind
which
has
maintained
its
effectiveness
during
seven
centuries
it
must
be
accorded
a
place
among
the
periods
of
history
with
all
our
advances
in
modern
education
we
have
not
found
it
necessary
or
even
advisable
to
change
in
any
essential
way
this
mold
in
which
the
human
intellect
has
been
cast
for
all
these
years
if
a
man
wants
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
or
for
some
practical
purpose
in
life
then
here
are
the
faculties
which
will
enable
him
to
make
a
good
beginning
on
the
road
he
wishes
to
travel
if
he
wants
knowledge
of
the
liberal
arts
or
the
consideration
of
man
duties
to
himself
to
his
and
to
his
creator
he
will
find
in
the
faculties
of
arts
and
philosophy
and
theology
the
great
sources
of
knowledge
in
these
subjects
if
on
the
other
hand
he
wishes
to
apply
his
mind
either
to
the
disputes
of
men
about
property
or
to
their
injustices
toward
one
another
and
the
correction
of
abuses
then
the
faculty
of
law
will
supply
his
wants
and
finally
the
medical
school
enables
him
if
he
wishes
to
learn
all
that
can
be
known
at
a
given
time
with
regard
to
man
ills
and
their
healing
we
have
admitted
the
subjects
into
university
life
though
not
without
protest
but
architecture
engineering
and
the
like
in
which
the
men
of
the
thirteenth
century
accomplished
such
wonders
were
relegated
to
the
guilds
whose
technical
schools
though
they
did
not
call
them
by
that
name
were
quite
as
effective
practical
educators
as
even
the
most
vaunted
of
our
modern
university
mechanical
departments
it
is
rather
interesting
to
trace
the
course
of
the
development
of
schools
in
our
modern
sense
of
the
term
because
their
evolution
recapitulates
to
some
degree
at
least
the
history
of
the
individual
interest
in
life
the
first
school
which
acquired
a
european
reputation
was
that
of
salernum
a
little
town
not
far
from
naples
which
possessed
a
famous
medical
school
as
early
as
the
ninth
century
perhaps
earlier
this
never
became
a
university
though
its
reputation
as
a
great
medical
school
was
maintained
for
several
centuries
this
first
educational
opportunity
to
attract
a
large
body
of
students
from
all
over
the
world
concerned
mainly
the
needs
of
the
body
the
next
set
of
interests
which
man
in
the
course
of
evolution
develops
has
to
do
with
the
acquisition
and
retention
of
property
and
the
maintenance
of
his
rights
as
an
individual
it
is
not
surprising
then
to
find
that
the
next
school
of
reputation
was
that
of
law
at
bologna
which
became
the
nucleus
of
a
great
university
it
is
only
after
man
has
looked
out
for
his
bodily
needs
and
his
property
rights
that
he
comes
to
think
of
his
duties
toward
himself
his
and
his
creator
and
so
the
third
of
these
great
medieval
schools
in
time
was
that
of
philosophy
and
theology
at
paris
it
is
sometimes
thought
that
the
word
university
applied
to
these
institutions
after
the
aggregation
of
other
faculties
was
due
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
universality
of
studies
that
all
branches
of
knowledge
might
be
followed
in
them
the
word
university
however
was
not
originally
applied
to
the
school
itself
which
if
it
had
all
the
faculties
of
the
modern
university
was
in
the
thirteenth
century
called
a
the
latin
word
universitas
had
quite
a
different
usage
at
that
time
whenever
letters
were
formally
addressed
to
the
combined
faculties
of
a
by
reigning
sovereigns
or
by
the
pope
or
by
other
high
ecclesiastical
authorities
they
always
began
with
the
designation
universitas
vestra
implying
that
the
greeting
was
to
all
of
the
faculty
universally
and
without
exception
gradually
because
of
this
word
constantly
occurring
at
the
beginning
of
letters
to
the
faculty
the
term
universitas
came
to
be
applied
to
the
institution
footnote
footnote
certain
other
terms
that
occur
in
these
letters
of
greeting
to
university
officials
have
a
more
than
passing
interest
the
rector
of
the
university
for
instance
was
always
formally
addressed
as
amplitudo
vestra
that
is
your
ampleness
considering
the
fact
that
not
a
few
of
the
rectors
of
the
old
time
universities
all
of
whom
were
necessarily
ecclesiastics
must
have
had
the
ampleness
of
girth
so
characteristic
of
their
order
under
certain
circumstances
there
is
an
appropriateness
about
this
formal
designation
which
perhaps
appeals
more
to
the
risibilities
of
the
modern
mind
than
to
those
of
medieval
time
while
the
universities
as
is
typically
exemplified
by
the
histories
of
bologna
and
paris
and
even
to
a
noteworthy
degree
of
oxford
grew
up
around
the
cathedrals
they
can
not
be
considered
in
any
sense
the
deliberate
creation
much
less
the
formal
invention
of
any
particular
set
of
men
the
idea
of
a
university
was
not
born
into
the
world
in
full
panoply
as
minerva
from
the
brain
of
jove
no
one
set
about
consciously
organizing
for
the
establishment
of
complete
institutions
of
learning
like
everything
destined
to
mean
much
in
the
world
the
universities
were
a
natural
growth
from
the
favoring
soil
in
which
living
seeds
were
planted
they
sprang
from
the
wonderful
inquiring
spirit
of
the
time
and
the
marvelous
desire
for
knowledge
and
for
the
higher
intellectual
life
that
came
over
the
people
of
europe
during
the
thirteenth
century
the
school
at
paris
became
famous
and
attracted
pupils
during
the
twelfth
century
because
of
the
interest
in
scholastic
philosophy
after
the
pupils
had
gathered
in
large
numbers
their
enthusiasm
led
to
the
establishment
of
further
courses
of
study
the
same
thing
was
true
at
bologna
where
the
study
of
law
first
attracted
a
crowd
of
earnest
students
and
then
the
demand
for
broader
education
led
to
the
establishment
of
other
faculties
above
all
there
was
no
conscious
attempt
on
the
part
of
any
supposed
better
class
to
stoop
down
and
uplift
those
presumably
below
it
as
we
shall
see
the
students
of
the
university
came
mainly
from
the
middle
class
of
the
population
they
became
ardently
devoted
to
their
teachers
as
in
all
really
educational
work
it
was
the
man
and
not
the
institution
that
counted
for
much
in
case
of
disagreement
of
one
of
these
with
the
university
authorities
not
infrequently
there
was
a
sacrifice
of
personal
advantage
for
the
moment
on
the
part
of
the
students
in
order
to
follow
a
favorite
teacher
paris
had
examples
of
this
several
times
before
the
thirteenth
century
and
notably
in
the
case
of
abelard
had
seen
thousands
of
students
follow
him
into
the
distant
desert
where
he
had
retired
later
on
when
abuses
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
of
paris
limited
the
university
privileges
led
to
the
withdrawal
of
students
and
the
foundation
of
oxford
there
was
a
community
of
interest
on
the
part
of
certain
members
of
the
faculty
and
thousands
of
students
this
movement
was
however
distinctly
of
a
popular
character
in
the
sense
that
it
was
not
guided
by
political
or
other
leaders
nearly
all
of
the
features
of
university
life
during
the
thirteenth
century
emphasize
the
democracy
of
feeling
of
the
students
and
make
it
clear
that
the
blowing
of
the
wind
of
the
spirit
of
human
liberty
and
intellectual
enthusiasm
influencing
the
minds
of
the
generation
rather
than
any
formal
attempt
on
the
part
of
any
class
of
men
deliberately
to
provide
educational
opportunities
is
the
underlying
feature
of
university
foundation
and
development
while
the
great
universities
of
paris
bologna
and
oxford
were
by
far
the
most
important
they
must
not
be
considered
as
the
only
educational
institutions
deserving
the
name
of
universities
even
in
our
modern
sense
that
took
definite
form
during
the
thirteenth
century
in
italy
mainly
under
the
fostering
care
of
ecclesiastics
encouraged
by
such
popes
as
innocent
iii
gregory
ix
and
honorius
iv
nearly
a
dozen
other
towns
and
cities
saw
the
rise
of

generalia
eventually
destined
and
that
within
a
few
decades
after
their
foundation
to
have
the
complete
set
of
faculties

behind

in
this
enthusiastic
movement
montpelier
had
for
over
a
century
before
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
rejoiced
in
a
medical
school
which
was
the
most
important
rival
of
that
at

at
the
beginning
this
reflected
largely
the
moorish
element
in
educational
affairs
in
europe
at
this
time
during
the
course
of
the
thirteenth
century
montpelier
developed
into
a
university
though
the
medical
school
still
continued
to
be
the
most
important
faculty
medical
students
from
all
over
the
world
flocked
to
the
salubrious
town
to
which
patients
from
all
over
were
attracted
and
its
teachers
and
writers
of
medicine
have
been
famous
in
medical
history
ever
since
how
thorough
was
the
organization
of
clinical
medical
work
at
montpelier
may
perhaps
best
be
appreciated
from
the
fact
noted
in
the
chapter
on
city
hospitals
organized
charity
that
when
pope
innocent
iii
wished
to
establish
a
model
hospital
at
rome
with
the
idea
that
it
would
form
an
exemplar
for
other
european
cities
he
sent
down
to
montpelier
and
summoned
guy
the
head
of
the
hospital
of
the
holy
ghost
in
that
city
to
the
papal
capital
to
establish
the
roman
hospital
of
the
holy
ghost
and
in
connection
with
it
a
large
number
of
hospitals
all
over
europe
a
corresponding
state
of
affairs
to
that
of
montpelier
is
to
be
noted
at
orleans
only
here
the
central
school
around
which
the
university
gradually
grouped
itself
was
the
faculty
of
civil
law
canon
law
was
taught
at
paris
in
connection
with
the
theological
course
but
there
had
always
been
objection
to
the
admission
of
civil
law
as
a
faculty
on
a
basis
of
equality
with
the
other
faculties
there
was
indeed
at
this
time
some
rivalry
between
the
civil
and
the
canon
law
and
so
the
study
of
civil
law
was
relegated
to
other
universities
even
early
in
the
twelfth
century
orleans
was
famous
for
its
school
of
civil
law
in
which
the
exposition
of
the
principles
of
the
old
roman
law
constituted
the
basis
of
the
university
course
during
the
thirteenth
century
the
remaining
departments
of
the
university
gradually
developed
so
that
by
the
close
of
the
century
there
seem
to
be
conservative
claims
for
over
one
thousand
students
besides
these
three
french
universities
were
also
established
at
angers
at
toulouse
and
the
beginnings
of
institutions
to
become
universities
early
in
the
next
century
are
recorded
at
avignon
and
cahors
spain
felt
the
impetus
of
the
university
movement
early
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
a
university
was
founded
at
palencia
about
the
end
of
the
first
decade
this
was
founded
by
alfonso
xii
and
was
greatly
encouraged
by
him
it
is
sometimes
said
that
this
university
was
transferred
to
salamanca
about
but
this
is
denied
by
denifle
whose
authority
in
matters
of
university
history
is
unquestionable
it
seems
not
unlikely
that
salamanca
drew
a
number
of
students
from
palencia
but
that
the
latter
continued
still
to
attract
many
students
about
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
university
of
valladolid
was
founded
before
the
end
of
the
century
a
fourth
university
that
of
lerida
had
been
established
in
the
spanish
peninsula
spain
was
to
see
the
greatest
development
of
universities
during
the
fourteenth
century
it
was
not
long
after
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
before
coimbra
in
portugal
began
to
assume
importance
as
an
educational
institution
though
it
was
not
to
have
sufficient
faculty
and
students
to
deserve
the
more
ambitious
title
of
university
for
half
a
century
while
most
people
who
know
anything
about
the
history
of
education
realize
the
important
position
occupied
by
the
universities
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
appreciate
the
estimation
in
which
they
were
held
and
the
numbers
that
attended
them
very
few
seem
to
know
anything
of
the
preparatory
schools
of
the
time
and
are
prone
to
think
that
all
the
educational
effort
of
these
generations
was
exhausted
in
connection
with
the
university
it
is
often
said
as
we
shall
see
that
one
reason
for
the
large
number
of
students
reported
as
in
attendance
at
the
universities
during
the
thirteenth
century
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
these
institutions
practically
combined
the
preparatory
school
and
the
academy
of
our
time
with
the
university
the
universities
are
supposed
to
have
been
the
only
centers
of
education
worthy
of
mention
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
number
of
quite
young
students
were
in
attendance
at
the
universities
that
is
boys
from
to
who
would
in
our
time
be
only
in
the
preparatory
school
we
shall
explain
however
in
the
chapter
on
the
numbers
in
attendance
at
the
universities
that
students
went
to
college
much
younger
in
the
past
and
graduated
much
earlier
than
they
do
in
our
day
yet
apparently
without
any
injury
to
the
efficacy
of
their
educational
training
in
the
universities
of
southern
europe
it
is
still
the
custom
for
boys
to
graduate
with
the
degree
of
a
at
the
age
of
to
which
supposes
attendance
at
the
university
or
its
equivalent
in
courses
at
the
age
of
or
even
less
there
is
no
need
however
to
appeal
to
the
precociousness
of
the
southern
nations
in
explanation
of
this
since
there
are
some
good
examples
of
it
in
comparatively
recent
times
here
in
america
most
of
the
colleges
in
this
country
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
graduated
young
men
of
and
and
thought
that
they
were
accomplishing
a
good
purpose
in
allowing
them
to
get
at
their
life
work
in
early
manhood
many
of
the
distinguished
divines
who
made
names
in
educational
work
are
famous
for
their
early
graduations
benjamin
rush
of
philadelphia
whom
the
medical
profession
of
this
country
hails
as
the
father
of
american
medicine
graduated
at
princeton
at
he
must
have
begun
his
college
course
therefore
about
the
age
of
this
may
be
considered
inadvisable
in
our
generation
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
are
many
even
in
our
day
who
think
that
our
college
men
are
allowed
to
get
at
their
somewhat
too
late
for
their
own
good
it
must
be
emphasized
moreover
that
in
many
of
the
university
towns
there
were
also
preparatory
schools
courses
were
not
regularly
organized
until
well
on
in
the
thirteenth
century
but
younger
brothers
and
friends
of
students
as
well
as
of
professors
would
not
infrequently
be
placed
under
their
care
and
thus
be
enabled
to
receive
their
preparation
for
university
work
at
paris
robert
sorbonne
founded
a
preparatory
school
for
that
institution
under
the
name
of
the
college
of
calvi
other
colleges
of
this
kind
also
existed
in
paris
this
custom
of
having
a
preparatory
school
in
association
with
the
university
has
not
been
abandoned
even
in
our
own
day
and
it
has
some
decided
advantages
from
an
educational
standpoint
though
perhaps
these
are
not
enough
to
balance
certain
ethical
disadvantages
almost
sure
to
attach
to
such
a
system
disadvantages
which
ultimately
led
in
the
middle
ages
to
the
prohibition
that
young
students
should
be
taken
at
the
universities
under
any
pretext
the
presence
of
these
young
students
in
university
towns
probably
did
add
considerably
to
the
numbers
reported
as
in
attendance
it
must
not
be
thought
however
that
there
were
no
formal
preparatory
schools
quite
apart
from
university
influence
this
thought
has
been
the
root
of
more
misunderstanding
of
the
medieval
system
of
education
than
almost
any
other
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
preliminary
and
preparatory
schools
what
we
would
now
call
academies
and
colleges
in
connection
with
all
of
the
important
monasteries
and
with
every
cathedral
schools
of
less
importance
were
required
by
a
decree
of
a
council
held
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
to
be
maintained
in
connection
with
every
bishop
church
during
the
thirteenth
century
there
were
some
twenty
cathedrals
in
various
parts
of
england
each
one
had
its
cathedral
school
besides
these
there
were
at
least
as
many
important
abbeys
nearly
a
dozen
of
them
immense
institutions
in
which
there
were
fine
libraries
large
writing
rooms
in
which
copies
of
books
were
being
constantly
made
many
of
the
members
of
the
communities
of
which
were
university
men
and
around
which
therefore
there
clung
an
atmosphere
of
bookishness
and
educational
influence
that
made
them
preparatory
schools
of
a
high
type
the
buildings
themselves
were
of
the
highest
type
of
architecture
the
community
life
was
well
calculated
to
bring
out
what
was
best
in
the
intellectuality
of
members
of
the
community
and
then
there
was
a
rivalry
between
the
various
religious
orders
which
made
them
prepare
their
men
well
in
order
that
they
might
do
honor
to
the
order
when
they
had
the
opportunity
later
as
most
of
those
who
had
the
ability
and
the
taste
actually
did
have
to
go
to
one
or
other
of
the
universities
this
system
of
preparatory
schools
need
not
be
accepted
on
the
mere
assumption
that
the
monasteries
and
churches
must
surely
have
set
about
such
work
because
there
is
abundant
evidence
of
the
actual
establishment
and
maintenance
of
such
schools
with
regard
to
the
monasteries
there
can
be
no
doubt
because
it
was
the
members
of
the
religious
orders
who
particularly
distinguished
themselves
at
the
universities
and
the
histories
of
oxford
cambridge
and
paris
are
full
of
their
accomplishments
they
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
right
to
have
their
own
houses
at
the
universities
and
to
have
their
own
examinations
count
in
university
work
in
order
that
they
might
maintain
their
influence
over
the
members
of
the
orders
during
the
precious
formative
period
of
their
intellectual
life
with
regard
to
the
church
schools
there
is
convincing
evidence
of
another
kind
in
the
chapter
on
the
foundation
of
city
hospitals
we
have
detailed
on
the
authority
of
virchow
all
that
innocent
iii
accomplished
for
the
hospital
system
of
europe
this
chapter
was
published
originally
in
the
form
of
a
lecture
from
the
historical
department
of
the
medical
school
of
fordham
university
and
a
reprint
of
it
was
sent
to
a
distinguished
american
educator
well
known
for
his
condemnation
of
supposed
church
intolerance
in
the
matter
of
education
and
scientific
development
he
said
that
he
was
glad
to
have
it
because
it
confirmed
and
even
broadened
the
idea
that
he
had
long
cherished
that
the
church
had
done
more
for
charity
during
the
despised
middle
ages
than
national
governments
had
ever
been
able
to
accomplish
since
though
it
was
all
the
more
surprising
to
him
that
it
should
not
have
under
the
circumstances
done
more
for
education
since
this
might
have
prevented
some
of
the
ills
that
charity
had
afterward
to
relieve
this
expression
very
probably
represents
the
state
of
mind
of
very
many
scholars
with
regard
to
this
period
the
church
is
supposed
to
have
interested
herself
in
charity
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
educational
influence
charity
is
of
course
admitted
to
be
her
special
work
yet
these
scholars
can
not
help
but
regret
that
more
was
not
done
in
social
prophylaxis
by
the
encouragement
of
education
in
the
light
of
this
almost
universal
expression
it
is
all
the
more
interesting
to
find
that
such
opinions
are
founded
entirely
on
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
what
was
done
in
education
since
the
same
pope
in
practically
the
same
way
and
by
the
exertion
of
the
same
prestige
and
ecclesiastical
authority
did
for
education
just
what
he
did
for
charity
in
the
matter
of
the
hospitals
and
the
ailing
poor
virchow
as
we
shall
see
declared
that
to
innocent
iii
is
due
the
foundation
of
practically
all
the
city
hospitals
in
europe
if
the
effect
of
certain
of
the
decrees
issued
in
his
papacy
be
carefully
followed
it
will
be
found
that
practically
as
many
schools
as
hospitals
owe
their
origin
to
his
beneficent
wisdom
and
his
paternal
desire
to
spread
the
advantages
of
christianity
all
over
the
civilized
world
this
policy
with
regard
to
the
hospitals
led
to
the
foundation
before
the
end
of
the
century
of
at
least
one
hospital
in
every
diocese
of
all
the
countries
which
were
more
closely
allied
with
the
holy
see
there
is
extant
a
decree
issued
by
the
famous
council
of
lateran
in
a
council
in
which
innocent
authority
was
dominant
requiring
the
establishment
of
a
chair
of
grammar
in
connection
with
every
cathedral
in
the
christian
world
this
chair
of
grammar
included
at
least
three
of
the
liberal
arts
and
provided
for
what
would
now
be
called
the
education
of
a
school

a
university

bishops
who
came
to
rome
were
sure
to
hear
inculcated
the
advisability
of
a
taste
for

clergymen
hear
it
said
often
enough
that
such
a
taste
would
surely
increase
the
usefulness
of
all
churchmen
schools
had
been
encouraged
before
the
issuance
of
the
decree
this
only
came
as
a
confirmatory
document
calculated
to
perpetuate
the
policy
that
had
already
been
so
prominently
in
vogue
in
the
church
for
over
fifteen
years
of
the
pope
reign
it
was
meant
too
to
make
clear
to
hesitant
and
tardy
bishops
who
might
have
thought
that
the
papal
interest
in
education
was
merely
personal
that
the
policy
of
the
church
was
concerned
in
it
and
recalled
them
to
a
sense
of
duty
in
the
matter
since
the
ordinary
enthusiasm
for
letters
even
with
the
added
encouragement
of
the
pope
did
not
suffice
to
make
them
realize
the
necessity
for
educational
establishments
the
institution
of
the
schools
of
grammar
in
connection
with
cathedrals
was
well
adapted
to
bring
about
a
definite
increase
in
the
opportunities
for
book
learning
for
those
who
desired
it
in
connection
with
the
cathedrals
there
was
always
a
band
of
canons
whose
duty
it
was
to
take
part
in
the
singing
of
the
daily
office
their
ceremonial
and
ritual
duties
did
not
however
occupy
them
more
than
a
few
hours
each
day
during
the
rest
of
the
time
they
were
free
to
devote
themselves
to
any
subject
in
which
they
might
be
interested
and
had
ample
time
for
teaching
the
requirement
that
there
should
be
at
least
a
school
of
grammar
in
connection
with
every
cathedral
afforded
definite
opportunity
to
such
of
these
ecclesiastics
as
had
intellectual
tastes
to
devote
themselves
to
the
spread
of
knowledge
and
of
culture
and
this
reacted
as
can
be
readily
understood
to
make
the
whole
band
of
canons
more
interested
in
the
things
of
the
mind
and
to
make
the
cathedral
even
more
the
intellectual
center
of
the
district
than
might
otherwise
have
been
the
case
for
the
metropolitan
churches
a
more
regulation
was
made
by
this
same
council
of
lateran
under
the
inspiration
of
the
pope
himself
these
important
archiepiscopal
cathedrals
were
required
to
maintain
professors
of
three
chairs
one
of
these
was
to
teach
grammar
a
second
philosophy
and
a
third
canon
law
under
these
designations
there
was
practically
included
much
of
what
is
now
studied
not
only
in
preparatory
schools
but
also
at
the
beginning
of
university
courses
the
regulation
was
evidently
intended
to
lead
eventually
to
the
formation
of
many
more
universities
than
were
then
in
existence
because
already
it
had
become
clear
that
the
traveling
of
students
to
long
distances
and
their
gathering
in
such
large
numbers
in
towns
away
from
home
influences
led
to
many
abuses
that
might
be
obviated
if
they
could
stay
in
their
native
cities
or
at
least
did
not
have
to
leave
their
native
provinces
this
was
a
regulation
that
like
so
many
other
decrees
of
the
century
manifests
the
very
practical
policy
of
the
pope
in
matters
of
education
as
well
as
charity
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
decree
did
lead
to
the
gradual
development
of
about
twenty
universities
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
to
the
establishment
of
a
number
of
other
schools
so
important
in
scope
and
attendance
that
their
evolution
into
universities
during
the
fourteenth
century
became
comparatively
easy
this
formal
church
law
moreover
imposed
upon
ecclesiastical
authorities
the
necessity
for
providing
for
even
higher
education
in
their
dioceses
and
made
them
realize
that
it
was
entirely
in
sympathy
with
the
church
spirit
and
in
accord
with
the
wish
of
the
father
of
christendom
that
they
should
make
as
ample
provision
for
education
as
they
did
for
charity
though
this
last
was
supposed
to
be
their
special
task
as
pastors
of
the
christian
flock
all
this
important
work
for
the
foundation
of
preparatory
schools
in
every
diocese
and
of
the
preliminary
organization
of
teaching
institutions
that
might
easily
develop
into
universities
as
they
actually
did
in
a
score
of
cases
in
metropolitan
cities

accomplished
under
the
first
pope
of
the
thirteenth
century
innocent
iii
his
successors
kept
up
this
good
work
pope
honorius
his
immediate
successor
went
so
far
in
this
matter
as
to
depose
a
bishop
who
had
not
read
donatus
the
popular
grammarian
of
the
time
the
bishop
evidently
was
considered
unfit
as
far
as
his
mental
training
went
to
occupy
the
important
post
of
head
of
a
diocese
pope
gregory
the
nephew
of
innocent
was
one
of
the
most
important
patrons
of
the
study
of
law
in
this
period
see
legal
origins
in
other
countries
and
encouraged
the
collection
of
the
decrees
of
former
popes
so
as
to
make
them
available
for
purposes
of
study
as
well
as
for
court
use
he
is
famous
for
having
protected
the
university
of
paris
during
some
of
the
serious
trouble
with
the
municipal
authorities
when
the
large
increase
of
the
number
of
students
in
attendance
at
the
university
had
unfortunately
brought
about
strained
relations
between
town
and
gown
pope
innocent
iv
by
several
decrees
encouraged
the
development
of
the
university
of
paris
increased
its
rights
and
conferred
new
privileges
he
also
did
much
to
develop
the
university
of
toulouse
and
especially
to
raise
its
standard
and
make
it
equal
to
that
of
paris
as
far
as
possible
the
patronage
of
toulouse
on
the
part
of
the
pope
is
all
the
more
striking
because
the
study
of
civil
law
was
here
a
special
feature
and
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
were
often
said
to
have
looked
askance
at
the
rising
prominence
of
civil
law
since
it
threatened
to
diminish
the
importance
of
canon
law
and
the
cultivation
of
it
only
too
frequently
seemed
to
give
rise
to
friction
between
civil
and
ecclesiastical
authorities
while
the
pontifical
court
of
innocent
iv
was
maintained
at
lyons
it
seemed
according
to
the
literary
history
of
france
footnote
more
like
an
academy
of
theology
and
of
canon
law
than
the
court
of
a
great
monarch
whose
power
was
acknowledged
throughout
the
world
or
a
great
ecclesiastic
who
might
be
expected
to
be
occupied

succeeding

prominent
in
their
patronage
of
education
pope

supported
the
cause

the
mendicant
friars
against
the
university
of
paris
but
this
was
evidently
with
the
best
of
intentions
the

came
to
claim
the
privilege

bacon
and

scotus
from
the
franciscans
to
show
the
truth
of
this
assertion
to
give
such
a
privilege
seemed
a
derogation
of
the
faculty
rights
and
the
university
refused
then
the
holy
see
interfered
to
insist
that
the
university
must
give
degrees
for
work
done
rather
than
merely
for
regulation

the
best
possible
proof
that
pope
alexander
can
not
be
considered
as
wishing
to
injure
or
even
diminish
the
prestige
of
the
university
in
any
way
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
he
afterwards
sent
two
of
his
nephews
to
paris
to
attend
at
the
university
all
these
popes
so
far
mentioned
were
not
frenchmen
and
therefore
could
have
no
national
feeling
in
the
matter
of
the
university
of
paris
or
of
the
french
universities
in
general
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
pope
urban
who
was
a
frenchman
and
an
alumnus
of
the
university
of
paris
elevated
many
french
scholars
and
especially
his
fellow
alumni
of
paris
to
church
dignitaries
of
various
kinds
after
urban

succeeded
him

founded
chairs
in

also

school

it
was
hoped
would
develop
into
a
university
at
gray
in
franche

in
a
word
looked
at
from
every
point
of
view
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
church
and
ecclesiastical
authorities
were
quite
as
much
interested
in
education
as
in
charity
during
this
century
and
it
is
to
them
that
must
be
traced
the
foundation
of
the
preparatory
schools
as
well
as
the
universities
and
the
origin
and
development
of
the
great
educational
movement
that
stamps
this
century
as
the
greatest
in
human

what
and
how
they
studied
at
the
universities
it
is
usually
the
custom
for
text
books
of
education
to
dismiss
the
teaching
at
the
universities
of
the
middle
ages
with
some
such
expression
as
the
teachers
were
mainly
engaged
in
metaphysical
speculations
and
the
students
were
occupied
with
exercises
in
logic
and
in
dialectics
learning
in
long
drawn
out
disputations
how
to
use
the
intellectual
instruments
they
possessed
but
never
actually
applying
them
all
knowledge
was
supposed
to
be
amenable
to
increase
through
dialectical
discussion
and
all
truth
was
supposed
to
be
obtainable
as
the
conclusion
of
a
regular
syllogism
great
fun
especially
is
made
of
the
disputations
the
public
exercises
in
dialectics
the
fine
distinctions
presumably
with
but
the
scantiest
basis
of
truth
behind
them
and
in
general
the
placing
of
words
for
realities
in
the
investigation
of
truth
and
the
conveyance
of
information
the
sublime
ignorance
of
educators
who
talk
thus
about
the
century
that
saw
the
rise
of
the
universities
in
connection
with
the
erection
of
the
great
cathedrals
is
only
equaled
by
their
assumption
of
knowledge
it
is
very
easy
to
make
fun
of
a
past
generation
and
often
rather
difficult
to
enter
into
and
appreciate
its
spirit
ridicule
comes
natural
to
human
nature
alas
but
sympathy
requires
serious
mental
application
for
understanding
sake
fortunately
there
has
come
in
recent
years
a
very
different
feeling
in
the
minds
of
many
mature
and
faithful
students
of
this
period
as
regards
the
middle
ages
and
its
education
dialectics
may
seem
to
be
a
waste
of
time
to
those
who
consider
the
training
of
the
human
mind
as
of
little
value
in
comparison
with
the
stocking
of
it
with
information
dialectical
training
will
probably
not
often
enable
men
to
earn
more
money
than
might
have
otherwise
been
the
case
this
will
be
eminently
true
if
the
dialectician
is
to
devote
himself
to
commercial
enterprises
in
his
future
life
if
he
is
to
take
up
one
of
the
professions
however
there
may
be
some
doubt
as
to
whether
even
his
practical
effectiveness
will
not
be
increased
by
a
good
course
of
logic
there
is
however
another
point
of
view
from
which
this
matter
of
the
study
of
dialectics
may
be
viewed
and
which
has
been
taken
very
well
by
saintsbury
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
in
a
recent
volume
on
the
thirteenth
century
he
insists
in
a
passage
which
we
quote
at
length
in
the
chapter
on
the
prose
of
the
century
that
if
this
training
in
logic
had
not
been
obtained
at
this
time
in
european
development
the
results
might
have
been
serious
for
our
modern
languages
and
modern
education
he
says
if
at
the
outset
of
the
career
of
the
modern
languages
men
had
thought
with
the
looseness
of
modern
thought
had
indulged
in
the
haphazard
slovenliness
of
modern
logic
had
popularized
theology
and
vulgarized
rhetoric
as
we
have
seen
both
popularized
and
vulgarized
since
we
should
indeed
have
been
in
evil
case
he
maintains
that
the
educative
influence
in
mere
language
in
mere
system
of
arrangement
and
expression
must
be
considered
as
one
of
the
great
benefits
of
scholasticism
this
is
after
all
only
a
similar
opinion
to
that
evidently
entertained
by
john
stuart
mill
who
as
saintsbury
says
was
not
often
a
philosopher
for
he
quotes
in
the
preface
of
his
logic
two
very
striking
opinions
from
very
different
sources
the
scotch
philosopher
hamilton
and
the
french
philosophical
writer
condorcet
hamilton
said
it
is
to
the
schoolmen
that
the
vulgar
languages
are
indebted
for
what
precision
and
analytical
subtlety
they
possess
condorcet
went
even
further
than
this
and
used
expressions
that
doubless
will
be
a
great
source
of
surprise
to
those
who
do
not
realize
how
much
of
admiration
is
always
engendered
in
those
who
really
study
the
schoolmen
seriously
and
do
not
take
opinions
of
them
from
the
chance
reading
of
a
few
scattered
passages
or
depend
for
the
data
of
their
judgment
on
some
authority
who
thought
it
clever
to
abuse
these
thinkers
condorcet
thought
them
far
in
advance
of
the
old
greek
philosophers
for
he
said
logic
ethics
and
metaphysics
itself
owe
to
scholasticism
a
precision
unknown
to
the
ancients
themselves
with
regard
to
the
methods
and
contents
of
the
teaching
in
the
undergraduate
department
of
the
university
that
is
in
what
we
would
now
call
the
arts
department
there
is
naturally
no
little
interest
at
the
present
time
besides
the
standards
set
up
and
the
tests
required
can
scarcely
fail
to
attract
attention
professor
turner
in
his
history
of
philosophy
has
summed
up
much
of
what
we
know
in
this
matter
in
a
paragraph
so
full
of
information
that
we
quote
it
in
order
to
give
our
readers
the
best
possible
idea
in
a
compendious
form
of
these
details
of
the
education
by
statutes
issued
at
various
times
during
the
thirteenth
century
it
was
provided
that
the
professor
should
read
that
is
expound
the
text
of
certain
standard
authors
in
philosophy
and
theology
in
a
document
published
by
denifle
the
distinguished
authority
on
medieval
universities
and
by
him
referred
to
the
year
we
find
the
following
works
among
those
prescribed
for
the
faculty
of
arts
logica

the
old
boethian
text
of
a

which
the
student
of

presented
himself
was
that
of
bachelor
the
candidate
for
this
degree
after
a
preliminary
test
called
responsiones
this
regulation
went
into
effect
not
later
than
presented
himself
for
the
determination
which
was
a
public
defense
of
a
certain
number
of
theses
against
opponents
chosen
from
the
audience
at
the
end
of
the
disputation
the
defender
summed
up
or
determined
his
conclusions
after
determining
the
bachelor
resumed
his
studies
for
the
licentiate
assuming
also
the
task
of
cursorily
explaining
to
junior
students
some
portion
of
the
organon
the
test
for
the
degree
of
licentiate
consisted
in
a
or
exposition
of
several
texts
after
the
manner
of
the
masters
the
student
was
now
a
licensed
teacher
he
did
not
however
become
magister
or
master
of
arts
until
he
had
delivered
what
was
called
the
or
inaugural
lecture
and
was
actually
installed

he
continued
to
teach
he
was
called
actu
if
he
departed
from
the
university
or
took
up
other
work
he
was
called

it
may
be
said
that
as
a
general
rule
the
course
of
reading
was
for
the
bachelor
degree

logic
and
psychology
for
the
licentiate
natural
philosophy
for
the
master
degree
ethics
and
the
completion
of
the
course
of
natural
philosophy
quite
apart
from
the
value
of
its
methods
however
scholasticism
in
certain
of
its
features
had
a
value
in
the
material
which
it
discussed
and
developed
that
modern
generations
only
too
frequently
fail
to
realize
with
regard
to
this
the
same
distinguished
authority
whom
we
quoted
with
regard
to
dialectics
saintsbury
does
not
hesitate
to
use
expressions
which
will
seem
little
short
of
rankly
heretical
to
those
who
swear
by
modern
science
and
yet
may
serve
to
inject
some
eminently
suggestive
ideas
into
a
sadly
misunderstood
subject
yet
there
has
always
in
generous
souls
who
have
some
tincture
of
philosophy
subsisted
a
curious
kind
of
sympathy
and
yearning
over
the
work
of
these
generations
of
mainly
disinterested
scholars
who
whatever
they
were
were
thorough
and
whatever
they
could
not
do
could
think
there
have
even
in
these
latter
days
been
some
graceless
ones
who
have
asked
whether
the
science
of
the
nineteenth
century
after
an
equal
interval
will
be
of
any
more
positive
value
whether
it
will
not
have
even
less
comparative
interest
than
that
which
appertains
to
the
scholasticism
of
the
thirteenth
in
the
light
of
this
it
has
seemed
well
to
try
to
show
in
terms
of
science
some
of
the
important
reflections
with
regard
to
such
problems
of
natural
history
as
magnetism
the
composition
of
matter
and
the
relation
of
things
physical
to
one
another
which
we
now
include
under
the
name
science
some
of
the
thoughts
that
these
scholars
of
the
thirteenth
century
were
thinking
and
were
developing
for
the
benefit
of
the
enthusiastic
students
who
flocked
to
the
universities
we
will
find
in
such
a
review
though
it
must
necessarily
be
brief
many
more
anticipations
of
modern
science
than
would
be
thought
possible
to
take
the
example
for
the
moment
of
magnetism
which
is
usually
considered
to
be
a
subject
entirely
of
modern
attention
a
good
idea
of
the
intense
interest
of
this
century
in
things
scientific
can
be
obtained
from
the
following
short
paragraph
in
which
brother
potamian
in
his
sketch
of
petrus
peregrinus
condenses
the
references
to
magnetic
phenomena
that
are
found
in
the
literature
of
the
time
most
of
the
writers
he
mentions
were
not
scientists
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
but
were
literary
men
and
the
fact
that
these
references
occur
shows
very
clearly
that
there
must
have
been
interest
in
such
scientific
phenomena
since
they
had
attracted
the
attention
of
literary
writers
who
would
not
have
spoken
of
them
doubtless
but
that
they
knew
that
in
this
they
would
be
satisfying
as
well
as
exciting
public
interest

with

note
by
bro
potamian
the
metaphysics
of
the
medieval
universities
have
come
in
for
quite
as
much
animadversion
not
to
say
ridicule
as
the
dialectics
none
of
its
departments
is
spared
in
the
condemnation
though
most
fun
is
made
of
the
gropings
of
the
medieval
mind
after
truth
in
the
physical
sciences
the
cosmology
the
science
of
matter
as
it
appealed
to
the
medieval
mind
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
so
entirely
speculative
as
to
deserve
no
further
attention
we
have
presumably
learned
so
much
by
experimental
demonstration
and
original
observation
in
the
physical
sciences
that
any
thinking
of
the
medieval
mind
along
these
lines
may
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
know
nothing
of
what
they
speak
be
set
aside
as
preposterous
or
at
best
nugatory
it
will
surely
be
a
source
of
surprise
then
to
find
that
in
the
consideration
of
the
composition
of
matter
and
of
the
problem
of
the
forces
connected
with
it
the
minds
of
the
medieval
schoolmen
were
occupied
with
just
the
same
questions
that
have
been
most
interesting
to
the
nineteenth
century
and
that
curiously
enough
the
conclusions
they
reached
though
by
very
different
methods
of
investigation
were
almost
exactly
the
same
as
those
to
which
modern
physical
scientists
have
attained
by
their
refined
methods
of
investigation
one
or
two
examples
will
suffice
i
think
to
show
very
clearly
that
the
students
of
the
thirteenth
century
had
presented
to
them
practically
the
same
problems
with
regard
to
matter
its
origin
and
composition
as
occupy
the
students
of
the
present
generation
for
instance
thomas
aquinas
usually
known
as
thomas
in
a
series
of
lectures
given
at
the
university
of
paris
toward
the
end
of
the
third
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
stated
as
the
most
important
conclusion
with
regard
to
matter
that
nihil
omnino
in
nihilum
nothing
at
all
will
ever
be
reduced
to
nothingness
by
this
it
was
very
evident
from
the
context
that
he
meant
that
matter
would
never
be
annihilated
and
could
never
be
destroyed
it
might
be
changed
in
various
ways
but
it
could
never
go
back
into
the
nothingness
from
which
it
had
been
taken
by
the
creative
act
annihilation
was
pronounced
as
not
being
a
part
of
the
scheme
of
things
as
far
as
the
human
mind
could
hope
to
fathom
its
meaning
in
this
sentence
then
thomas
of
aquin
was
proclaiming
the
doctrine
of
the
indestructibility
of
matter
it
was
not
until
well
on
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
the
chemists
and
physicists
of
modern
times
realized
the
truth
of
this
great
principle
the
chemists
had
seen
matter
change
its
form
in
many
ways
had
seen
it
disappear
apparently
in
the
smoke
of
fire
or
evaporate
under
the
influence
of
heat
but
investigation
proved
that
if
care
were
taken
in
the
collection
of
the
gases
that
came
off
under
these
circumstances
of
the
ashes
of
combustion
and
of
the
residue
of
evaporation
all
the
original
material
that
had
been
contained
in
the
supposedly
disappearing
substance
could
be
recovered
or
at
least
completely
accounted
for
the
physicists
on
their
part
had
realized
this
same
truth
and
finally
there
came
the
definite
enunciation
of
the
absolute
indestructibility
of
matter
thomas
conclusion
nothing
at
all
will
ever
be
reduced
to
nothingness
had
anticipated
this
doctrine
by
nearly
seven
centuries
what
happened
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
that
there
came
an
experimental
demonstration
of
the
truth
of
the
principle
the
principle
itself
however
had
been
reached
long
before
by
the
human
mind
by
speculative
processes
quite
as
inerrable
in
their
way
as
the
more
modern
method
of
investigation
when
thomas
used
the
aphorism
nothing
at
all
will
ever
be
reduced
to
nothingness
there
was
another
signification
that
he
attached
to
the
words
quite
as
clearly
as
that
by
which
they
expressed
the
indestructibility
of
matter
for
him
or
nothing
meant
neither
nor
that
is
neither
the
material
substance
nor
the
energy
which
is
contained
in
it
he
meant
then
that
no
energy
would
ever
be
destroyed
as
well
as
no
matter
would
ever
be
annihilated
he
was
teaching
the
conservation
of
energy
as
well
as
the
indestructibility
of
matter
here
once
more
the
experimental
demonstration
of
the
doctrine
was
delayed
for
over
six
centuries
and
a
half
the
truth
itself
however
had
been
reached
by
this
medieval
and
was
the
subject
of
his
teaching
to
the
university
students
in
paris
in
the
thirteenth
century
these
examples
should
i
think
serve
to
illustrate
that
the
minds
of
medieval
students
were
occupied
with
practically
the
same
questions
as
those
which
are
now
taught
to
the
university
students
of
our
day
there
are
however
some
even
more
striking
anticipations
of
modern
teaching
that
will
serve
to
demonstrate
this
community
of
educational
interests
in
spite
of
seven
centuries
of
time
separation
in
recent
years
we
have
come
to
realize
that
matter
is
not
the
manifold
material
we
were
accustomed
to
think
it
when
we
accepted
the
hypothesis
that
there
were
some
seventy
odd
different
kinds
of
atoms
each
one
absolutely
independent
of
any
other
and
representing
an
ultimate
term
in
science
the
atomic
theory
from
this
standpoint
has
proved
to
be
only
a
working
hypothesis
that
was
useful
for
a
time
but
that
our
physicists
are
now
agreed
must
not
be
considered
as
something
absolute
radium
has
been
observed
changing
into
helium
and
the
relations
of
atoms
to
one
another
as
they
are
now
known
make
it
almost
certain
that
all
of
them
have
an
underlying
the
same
in
all
but
differentiated
by
the
dynamic
energies
with
which
matter
in
its
different
forms
is
gifted
sir
oliver
lodge
has
stated
this
theory
of
the
constitution
of
matter
very
clearly
in
recent
years
and
in
doing
so
has
only
been
voicing
the
practically
universal
sentiment
of
those
who
have
been
following
the
latest
developments
in
the
physical
sciences
strange
as
it
may
appear
this
was
exactly
the
teaching
of
aquinas
and
the
schoolmen
with
regard
to
the
constitution
of
matter
they
said
that
the
two
constituting
principles
of
matter
were
prime
matter
and
form
by
prime
matter
they
meant
the
material
the
same
in
all
material
things
by
form
they
meant
the
special
dynamic
energy
which
entering
into
prime
matter
causes
it
to
act
differently
from
other
kinds
and
gives
it
all
the
particular
qualities
by
which
we
recognize
it
this
theory
was
not
original
with
them
having
been
adopted
from
aristotle
but
it
was
very
clearly
set
forth
profoundly
discussed
and
amply
illustrated
by
the
schoolmen
in
its
development
this
theory
was
made
to
be
of
the
greatest
help
in
the
explanation
of
many
other
difficulties
with
regard
to
living
as
well
as
things
in
their
hands
the
theory
has
its
difficulties
but
they
are
less
than
those
of
any
other
theory
of
the
constitution
of
matter
and
it
has
been
accepted
by
more
philosophic
thinkers
since
the
thirteenth
century
than
any
other
doctrine
of
similar
nature
it
may
be
said
that
it
was
reached
only
by
deduction
and
not
by
experimental
observation
such
an
expression
however
instead
of
being
really
an
objection
is
rather
a
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
great
truths
may
be
reached
by
deduction
yet
only
demonstrated
by
inductive
methods
many
centuries
later
of
course
it
may
well
be
said
even
after
all
these
communities
of
interest
between
the
medieval
and
the
modern
teaching
of
the
general
principles
of
science
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
universities
of
the
middle
ages
did
not
present
the
subjects
under
discussion
in
a
practical
way
and
their
teaching
was
not
likely
to
lead
to
directly
beneficial
results
in
applied
science
it
might
well
he
responded
to
this
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
a
university
to
teach
applications
of
science
but
only
the
great
principles
the
broad
generalizations
that
underlie
scientific
thinking
leaving
details
to
be
filled
in
in
whatever
form
of
practical
work
the
man
may
take
up
very
few
of
those
however
who
talk
about
the
purely
speculative
character
of
medieval
teaching
have
manifestly
ever
made
it
their
business
to
know
anything
about
the
actual
facts
of
university
teaching
by
definite
knowledge
but
have
rather
allowed
themselves
to
be
guided
by
speculation
and
by
inadequate
authorities
whose
dicta
they
have
never
taken
the
trouble
to
substantiate
by
a
glance
at
contemporary
authorities
on
medieval
matters
it
will
be
interesting
to
quote
for
the
information
of
such
men
the
opinion
of
the
greatest
of
medieval
scientists
with
regard
to
the
reason
why
men
do
not
obtain
real
knowledge
more
rapidly
than
would
seem
ought
to
be
the
case
from
the
amount
of
work
which
they
have
devoted
to
obtaining
it
roger
bacon
summing
up
for
pope
clement
the
body
of
doctrine
that
he
was
teaching
at
the
university
of
oxford
in
the
thirteenth
century
starts
out
with
the
principle
that
there
are
four
grounds
of
human
ignorance
these
are
first
trust
in
inadequate
authority
second
the
force
of
custom
which
leads
men
to
accept
too
unquestioningly
what
has
been
accepted
before
their
time
third
the
placing
of
confidence
in
the
opinion
of
the
inexperienced
and
fourth
the
hiding
of
one
own
ignorance
with
the
parade
of
a
superficial
wisdom
surely
no
one
will
ever
be
able
to
improve
on
these
four
grounds
for
human
ignorance
and
they
continue
to
be
as
important
in
the
twentieth
century
as
they
were
in
the
thirteenth
they
could
only
have
emanated
from
an
eminently
practical
mind
accustomed
to
test
by
observation

by
careful
searching

authorities

number
of
things
which
roger
bacon
succeeded
in
discovering
by
the
application
of
the
principle
of
testing
everything
by
personal
observation
is
almost
incredible
to
a
modern
student
of
science
and
of
education
who
has
known
nothing
before
of
the
progress
in
science
made
by
this
wonderful
man
he
has
been
sometimes
declared
to
be
the
discoverer
of
gunpowder
but
this
is
a
mistake
since
it
was
known
many
years
before
by
the
arabs
and
by
them
introduced
into
europe
he
did
study
explosives
very
deeply
however
and
besides
learning
many
things
about
them
realized
how
much
might
be
accomplished
by
their
use
in
the
he
declares
in
his
opus
magnum
that
one
may
cause
to
burst
forth

formidable

explosion
accompanied
by

brilliant
light
one
may
multiply
this
phenomenon
so
far
as
to
destroy
a
city
or
an
army
considering
how
little
was
known
about
gunpowder
at
this
time
this
was
of
itself
a
marvelous
anticipation
of
what
might
be
accomplished
by
it

rathhaus
tangermünde
bacon
prophesied
however
much
more
than
merely
destructive
effects
from
the
use
of
high
explosives
and
indeed
it
is
almost
amusing
to
see
how
closely
he
anticipated
some
of
the
most
modern
usages
of
high
explosives
for
motor
purposes
he
seems
to
have
concluded
that
some
time
the
apparently
uncontrollable
forces
of
explosion
would
come
under
the
control
of
man
and
be
harnessed
by
him
for
his
own
purposes
he
realized
that
one
of
the
great
applications
of
such
a
force
would
be
for
transportation
accordingly
he
said

construct

traverse

it
was
not
with
regard
to
explosives
alone
however
that
roger
bacon
was
to
make
great
advances
and
still
more
marvelous
anticipations
in
physical
science
he
was
not
as
is
sometimes
claimed
for
him
either
the
inventor
of
the
telescope
or
of
the
theory
of
lenses
he
did
more
however
than
perhaps
anyone
else
to
make
the
principles
of
lenses
clear
and
to
establish
them
on
a
mathematical
basis
his
traditional
connection
with
the
telescope
can
probably
be
traced
to
the
fact
that
he
was
very
much
interested
in
astronomy
and
the
relations
of
the
heavens
to
the
earth
he
pointed
out
very
clearly
the
errors
which
had
crept
into
the
julian
calendar
calculated
exactly
how
much
of
a
correction
was
needed
in
order
to
restore
the
year
to
its
proper
place
and
suggested
the
method
by
which
future
errors
of
this
kind
could
be
avoided
his
ideas
were
too
far
beyond
his
century
to
be
applied
in
a
practical
way
but
they
were
not
to
be
without
their
effect
and
it
is
said
that
they
formed
the
basis
of
the
subsequent
correction
of
the
calendar
in
the
time
of
pope
gregory
xiii
three
centuries
later
it
is
rather
surprising
to
find
how
much
besides
the
theory
of
lenses
friar
bacon
had
succeeded
in
finding
out
in
the
department
of
optics
he
taught
for
instance
the
principle
of
the
aberration
of
light
and
still
more
marvelous
to
consider
taught
that
light
did
not
travel
instantaneously
but
had
a
definite
rate
of
motion
though
this
was
extremely
rapid
it
is
rather
difficult
to
understand
how
he
reached
this
conclusion
since
light
travels
so
fast
that
as
far
as
regards
any
observation
that
can
be
made
upon
earth
the
diffusion
is
practically
instantaneous
it
was
not
for
over
three
centuries
later
that
römer
the
german
astronomer
demonstrated
the
motion
of
light
and
its
rate
by
his
observations
upon
the
moons
of
jupiter
at
different
phases
of
the
earth
orbit
which
showed
that
the
light
of
these
moons
took
a
definite
and
quite
appreciable
time
to
reach
the
earth
after
their
eclipse
by
the
planet
was
over
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
that
bacon
should
praise
those
of
his
contemporaries
who
devoted
themselves
to
mathematics
and
to
experimental
observations
in
science
of
one
of
his
correspondents
who
even
from
distant
italy
sent
him
his
observations
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
great
franciscan
precious
comments
on
them
bacon
has
given
quite
a
panegyric
the
reasons
for
his
praise
however
are
so
different
from
those
which
are
ordinarily
proclaimed
to
have
been
the
sources
of
laudation
in
distant
medieval
scientific
circles
that
we
prefer
to
quote
bacon
own
words
from
the
opus
tertium
bacon
is
talking
of
petrus
peregrinus
and
says
i
know
of
only
one
person
who
deserves
praise
for
his
work
in
experimental
philosophy
for
he
does
not
care
for
the
discourses
of
men
and
their
wordy
warfare
but
quietly
and
diligently
pursues
the
works
of
wisdom
therefore
what
others
grope
after
blindly
as
bats
in
the
evening
twilight
this
man
contemplates
in
all
their
brilliancy
because
he
is
a
master
of
experiment
hence
he
knows
all
natural
science
whether
pertaining
to
medicine
and
alchemy
or
to
matters
celestial
and
terrestrial
he
has
worked
diligently
in
the
smelting
of
ores
as
also
in
the
working
of
minerals
he
is
thoroughly
acquainted
with
all
sorts
of
arms
and
implements
used
in
military
service
and
in
hunting
besides
which
he
is
skilled
in
agriculture
and
in
the
measurement
of
lands
it
is
impossible
to
write
a
useful
or
correct
treatise
in
experimental
philosophy
without
mentioning
this
man
name
moreover
he
pursues
knowledge
for
its
own
sake

if
he
wished
to
obtain
royal
favor
he
could
easily
find
sovereigns
who
would
honor
and
enrich

lest
it
should
be
thought
that
these
expressions
of
laudatory
appreciation
of
the
great
thirteenth
century
scientist
are
dictated
more
by
the
desire
to
magnify
his
work
and
to
bring
out
the
influence
in
science
of
the
churchmen
of
the
period
it
seems
well
to
quote
an
expression
of
opinion
from
the
modern
historian
of
the
inductive
sciences
whose
praise
is
scarcely
if
any
less
outspoken
than
that
of
others
whom
we
have
quoted
and
who
might
be
supposed
to
be
somewhat
partial
in
their
judgment
this
opinion
will
fortify
the
doubters
who
must
have
authority
and
at
the
same
time
sums
up
very
excellently
the
position
which
roger
bacon
occupies
in
the
history
of
science
whewell
says
that
roger
bacon
opus
majus
is
the
encyclopedia
and
novam
organon
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
work
equally
wonderful
with
regard
to
its
general
scheme
and
to
the
special
treatises
with
which
the
outlines
of
the
plans
are
filled
up
the
professed
object
of
the
work
is
to
urge
the
necessity
of
a
reform
in
the
mode
of
philosophizing
to
set
forth
the
reasons
why
knowledge
had
not
made
a
greater
progress
to
draw
back
attention
to
the
sources
of
knowledge
which
had
been
unwisely
neglected
to
discover
other
sources
which
were
yet
almost
untouched
and
to
animate
men
in
the
undertaking
by
a
prospect
of
the
vast
advantages
which
it
offered
in
the
development
of
this
plan
all
the
leading
portions
of
science
are
expanded
in
the
most
complete
shape
which
they
had
at
that
time
assumed
and
improvements
of
a
very
wide
and
striking
kind
are
proposed
in
some
of
the
principal
branches
of
study
even
if
the
work
had
no
leading
purposes
it
would
have
been
highly
valuable
as
a
treasure
of
the
most
solid
knowledge
and
soundest
speculations
of
the
time
even
if
it
had
contained
no
such
details
it
would
have
been
a
work
most
remarkable
for
its
general
views
and
scope
it
is
only
what
might
have
been
expected
however
from
roger
bacon
training
that
he
should
have
made
great
progress
in
the
physical
sciences
at
the
university
of
paris
his
favorite
teacher
was
albertus
magnus
who
was
himself
deeply
interested
in
all
the
physical
sciences
though
he
was
more
concerned
with
the
study
of
chemical
problems
than
of
the
practical
questions
which
were
to
occupy
his
greatest
pupil
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
that
albertus
magnus
accomplished
a
great
amount
of
experimental
work
in
chemistry
and
had
made
a
large
series
of
actual
observations
he
was
a
theologian
as
well
as
a
philosopher
and
a
scientist
some
idea
of
the
immense
industry
of
the
man
can
be
obtained
from
the
fact
that
his
complete
works
as
published
consist
of
some
twenty
large
folio
volumes
each
one
of
which
contains
on
the
average
at
least
words
among
these
works
are
many
treatises
relating
to
chemistry
the
titles
of
some
of
them
will
serve
to
show
how
explicit
was
albert
in
his
consideration
of
various
chemical
subjects
he
has
treatises
concerning
metals
and
minerals
concerning
alchemy
a
treatise
on
the
secret
of
chemistry
a
concordance
that
is
a
collection
of
observations
from
many
sources
with
regard
to
the
philosopher
stone
a
brief
compend
on
the
origin
of
the
metals
a
treatise
on
compounds
most
of
these
are
to
be
found
in
his
works
under
the
general
heading
theatrum
chemicum
it
is
not
surprising
for
those
who
know
of
albert
work
to
find
that
his
pupil
roger
bacon
defined
the
limits
of
chemistry
very
accurately
and

the

scientific

in

time

whose
own

serve
to

at

the
extent
of

and
the
presumptuous
ignorance
of
those
who
make
little
of
the
science
of
the
medieval
period

we
have
catalogued
for
instance
the
many
facts
with
regard
to
astronomy

the
physics

light
that
are
supposed
to
have
come
to
human
ken
much
later

may
be
seen
to
have
been
clearly
within
the

evidently
formed
the

various
times

can
scarcely

be
amused
at
the
pretentious

relegated

rightly
looked
upon
as
the

father
of

an
honor
that
history
has
unfortunately
taken
from
him
to
confer
it
undeservedly
on
his
namesake
of
four
centuries
later
but
the
teaching
out
of
which
roger
bacon
was
to
develop
the
principles
of
experimental
science
can
be
found
in
many
places
in
his

he
catalogues
and
describes
all

expression
that
he
found
in
albertus
magnus

some
exceedingly
acute
remarks
on

and

of

will
come
as
a
supreme
surprise
a
few
details
with
regard
to
albert
botanical
knowledge
however
will
serve
to
heighten
that
surprise
and
to
show
that
the
foolish
tirades
of
modern
sciolists
who
have
often
expressed
their
wonder
that
with
all
the
beauties
of
nature
around
them
these
scholars
of
the
middle
ages
did
not
devote
themselves
to
nature
study
are
absurd
because
if
the
critics
but
knew
it
there
was
profound
interest
in
nature
and
all
her
manifestations
and
a
series
of
discoveries
that
anticipated
not
a
little
of
what
we
consider
most
important
in
our
modern
science
the
story
of
albert
botanical
knowledge
has
been
told
in
a
single
very
full
paragraph
by
his
biographer
sighart
also
quotes
an
appreciative
opinion
from
a
modern
german
botanist
which
will
serve
to
dispel
any
doubts
with
regard
to
albert
position
in
botany
that
modern
students
might
perhaps
continue
to
harbor
unless
they
had
good
authority
to
support
their
opinion
though
of
course
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
main
difference
between
the
medieval
and
the
modern
mind
is
only
too
often
said
to
be
that
the
medieval
required
an
authority
while
the
modern
makes
its
opinion
for
itself
even
the
most
skeptical
of
modern
minds
however
will
probably
be
satisfied
by
the
following
paragraph
he
was
acquainted
with
the
sleep
of
plants
with
the
periodical
opening
and
closing
of
blossoms
with
the
diminution
of
sap
through
evaporation
from
the
cuticle
of
the
leaves
and
with
the
influence
of
the
distribution
of
the
bundles
of
vessels
on
the
folial
indentations
his
minute
observations
on
the
forms
and
variety
of
plants
intimate
an
exquisite
sense
of
floral
beauty
he
distinguished
the
star
from
the
tells
us
that
a
red
rose
will
turn
white
when
submitted
to
the
vapor
of
sulphur
and
makes
some
very
sagacious
observations
on
the
subject
of
germination
the
extraordinary
erudition
and
originality
of
this
treatise
his
tenth
book
has
drawn
from
meyer
the
following
comment
botanist
who
lived
before
albert
can
be
compared
to
him
unless
theophrastus
with
whom
he
was
not
acquainted
and
after
him
none
has
painted
nature
in
such
living
colors
or
studied
it
so
profoundly
until
the
time
of
conrad
gesner
and
cesalpino
all
honor
then
to
the
man
who
made
such
astonishing
progress
in
the
science
of
nature
as
to
find
no
one
i
will
not
say
to
surpass
but
even
to
equal
him
for
the
space
of
three
centuries
we
point
out
in
the
chapter
on
geography
and
exploration
how
much
this
wonderful
thirteenth
century
added
to
the
knowledge
of
geographical
science
even
before
the
great
explorers
of
this
time
however
had
accomplished
their
work
this
particular
branch
of
science
had
made
such
great
progress
as
would
bring
it
quite
within
the
domain
of
what
we
call
the
science
of
geography
at
the
present
time
when
we
remember
how
much
has
been
said
about
the
ignorance
of
the
men
of
the
later
middle
ages
as
regards
the
shape
of
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
and
how
many
foolish
notions
they
are
supposed
to
have
accepted
with
regard
to
the
limitation
of
possible
residents
of
the
world
and
the
queer
ideas
as
to
the
antipodes
the
following
passages
taken
from
albert
biographer
will
serve
better
than
anything
else
to
show
how
absurdly
the
traditional
notions
with
regard
to
this
time
and
its
knowledge
have
been
permitted
by
educators
to
tinge
what
are
supposed
to
be
serious
opinions
with
regard
to
the
subject
matters
of
education
in
that
early
university
period
he
treats
as
fabulous
the
idea
in
which
bede
had
acquiesced
that
the
region
of
the
earth
south
of
the
equator
was
uninhabitable
and
considers
that
from
the
equator
to
the
south
pole
the
earth
was
not
only
habitable
but
in
all
probability
actually
inhabited
except
directly
at
the
poles
where
he
imagines
the
cold
to
be
excessive
if
there
be
any
animals
there
he
says
they
must
have
very
thick
skins
to
defend
them
from
the
rigor
of
the
climate
and
they
are
probably
of
a
white
color
the
intensity
of
cold
is
however
tempered
by
the
action
of
the
sea
he
describes
the
antipodes
and
the
countries
they
comprise
and
divides
the
climate
of
the
earth
into
seven
zones
he
smiles
with
a
freedom
at
the
simplicity
of
those
who
suppose
that
persons
living
at
the
opposite
region
of
the
earth
must
fall
off
an
opinion
that
can
only
rise
out
of
the
grossest
ignorance
when
we
speak
of
the
lower
hemisphere
this
must
be
understood
merely
as
relatively
to
ourselves
it
is
as
a
geographer
that
albert
superiority
to
the
writers
of
his
own
time
chiefly
appears
bearing
in
mind
the
astonishing
ignorance
which
then
prevailed
on
this
subject
it
is
truly
admirable
to
find
him
correctly
tracing
the
chief
mountain
chains
of
europe
with
the
rivers
which
take
their
source
in
each
remarking
on
portions
of
coast
which
have
in
later
times
been
submerged
by
the
ocean
and
islands
which
have
been
raised
by
volcanic
action
above
the
level
of
the
sea
noticing
the
modification
of
climate
caused
by
mountains
seas
and
forests
and
the
division
of
the
human
race
whose
differences
he
ascribes
to
the
effect
upon
them
of
the
countries
they
inhabit
in
speaking
of
the
british
isles
he
alludes
to
the
idea
that
another
distant
island
called
tile
or
thule
existed
far
in
the
western
ocean
uninhabitable
by
reason
of
its
frightful
climate
but
which
he
says
has
perhaps
not
yet
been
visited
by
man
nothing
will
so
seriously
disturb
the
complacency
of
modern
minds
as
to
the
wonderful
advances
that
have
been
made
in
the
last
century
in
all
branches
of
physical
science
as
to
read
albertus
magnus
writings
nothing
can
be
more
wholesomely
chastening
of
present
day
conceit
than
to
get
a
proper
appreciation
of
the
extent
of
the
knowledge
of
the
schoolmen
albertus
magnus
other
great
pupil
besides
roger
bacon
was
thomas
aquinas
if
any
suspicion
were
still
left
that
thomas
did
not
appreciate
just
what
the
significance
of
his
teachings
in
physics
was
when
he
announced
that
neither
matter
nor
force
could
ever
be
reduced
to
nothingness
it
would
surely
be
removed
by
the
consideration
that
he
had
been
for
many
years
in
intimate
relations
with
albert
and
that
he
had
probably
also
been
close
to
roger
bacon
after
association
with
such
men
as
these
any
knowledge
he
displays
with
regard
to
physical
science
can
scarcely
be
presumed
to
have
been
stumbled
upon
unawares
thomas
himself
has
left
three
treatises
on
chemical
subjects
and
it
is
said
that
the
first
occurrence
of
the
word
amalgam
can
be
traced
to
one
of
these
treatises
everybody
was
as
much
interested
then
as
we
are
at
the
present
time
in
the
transformation
of
metals
and
mercury
with
its
silvery
sheen
its
facility
to
enter
into
metallic
combinations
of
all
kinds
and
its
elusive
ways
naturally
made
it
the
center
of
scientific
interest
quite
as
radium
is
at
the
present
moment
further
material
with
regard
to
thomas
and
also
to
the
subject
of
education
will
be
found
in
the
chapter
aquinas
the
scholar
after
this
brief
review
of
only
a
few
of
the
things
that
they
taught
in
science
at
the
thirteenth
century
universities
most
people
will
scarcely
fail
to
wonder
how
such
peculiar
erroneous
impressions
with
regard
to
the
uselessness
of
university
teaching
and
training
have
come
to
be
so
generally
accepted
the
fault
lies
of
course
with
those
who
thought
they
knew
something
about
university
teaching
and
who
because
they
found
a
few
things
that
now
look
ridiculous
as
certain
supposed
facts
of
one
generation
always
will
to
succeeding
generations
who
know
more
about
them
thought
they
could
conclude
from
these
as
to
the
character
of
the
whole
content
of
medieval
education
it
is
only
another
example
of
what
artemus
ward
pointed
out
so
effectively
when
he
said
that
there
is
nothing
that
makes
men
so
ridiculous
as
the
knowing
so
many
things
that
aint
so
we
have
been
accepting
without
question
ever
so
many
things
that
simply
are
not
so
with
regard
to
these
wonderful
generations
who
not
only
organized
the
universities
but
organized
the
teaching
in
them
on
lines
not
very
different
from
those
which
occupy
people
seven
centuries
later
what
would
be
the
most
amusing
feature
if
it
were
not
unfortunately
so
serious
an
arraignment
of
the
literature
that
has
grown
up
around
these
peculiar
baseless
notions
with
regard
to
scholastic
philosophy
is
the
number
of
men
of
science
who
have
permitted
themselves
to
make
fun
of
certain
supposed
lucubrations
of
the
great
medieval
philosophers
it
is
not
so
very
long
ago
that
as
pointed
out
by
harper
in
the
metaphysics
of
the
school
professor
tate
in
a
lecture
on
some
recent
advances
in
physical
science
repeated
the
old
slander
that
even
aquinas
occupied
the
attention
of
his
students
with
such
inane
questions
as
how
many
angels
could
dance
on
the
point
of
a
needle
modern
science
very
proudly
insists
that
it
occupies
itself
with
observations
and
concerns
itself
little
with
authority
tate
in
this
unhappy
quotation
shows
not
only
that
he
has
made
no
personal
studies
in
medieval
philosophy
but
that
he
has
accepted
a
very
inadequate
authority
for
the
statements
which
he
makes
with
as
much
confidence
as
if
they
had
been
the
result
of
prolonged
research
in
this
field
many
other
modern
scientists
have
fallen
into
like
blunders
for
huxley
opinion
see
appendix
the
modern
student
as
well
as
the
teacher
is
prone
to
wonder
what
were
the
methods
of
study
and
the
habits
of
life
of
the
students
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
fortunately
we
have
a
short
sketch
written
by
robert
of
sorbonne
the
famous
founder
of
the
sorbonne
in
which
he
gives
advice
to
attendants
at
that
institution
as
to
how
they
should
spend
their
time
so
that
at
least
we
are
able
to
get
a
hint
of
the
ideals
that
were
set
before
the
student
robert
whose
long
experience
of
university
life
made
him
thoroughly
competent
to
advise
said
the
student
who
wishes
to
make
progress
ought
to
observe
six
essential
rules
first
he
ought
to
consecrate
a
certain
hour
every
day
to
the
study
of
a
determined
subject
as
bernard
counselled
his
monks
in
his
letter
to
the
brothers
of
the
mont
dieu
second
he
ought
to
concentrate
his
attention
upon
what
he
reads
and
ought
not
to
let
it
pass
lightly
there
is
between
reading
and
study
as
bernard
says
the
same
difference
as
between
a
host
and
a
guest
between
a
passing
salutation
exchanged
in
the
street
and
an
embrace
prompted
by
an
unalterable
affection
third
he
ought
to
extract
from
the
daily
study
one
thought
some
truth
or
other
and
engrave
it
deeply
upon
his
memory
with
special
care
seneca
said
multa
percurreris
in
die
unum
tibi
elige
quod
illa
die
when
you
have
run
over
many
things
in
a
day
select
one
for
yourself
which
you
should
digest
well
on
that
day
fourth
write
a
resume
of
it
for
words
which
are
not
confided
to
writing
fly
as
does
the
dust
before
the
wind
fifth
talk
the
matter
over
with
your
either
in
the
regular
recitation
or
in
your
familiar
conversation
this
exercise
is
even
more
profitable
than
study
for
it
has
as
its
result
the
clarifying
of
all
doubts
and
the
removing
of
all
the
obscurity
that
study
may
have
left
nothing
is
perfectly
known
unless
it
has
been
tried
by
the
tooth
of
disputation
sixth
pray
for
this
is
indeed
one
of
the
best
ways
of
learning
bernard
teaches
that
study
ought
to
touch
the
heart
and
that
one
should
profit
by
it
always
by
elevating
the
heart
to
god
however
interrupting
the
sorbonne
proceeds
in
a
tone
that
vividly
recalls
the
modern
university
professor
who
has
seen
generation
after
generation
of
students
and
has
learned
to
realize
how
many
of
them
waste
their
time
certain
students
act
like
fools
they
display
great
subtility
over
nonsensical
subjects
and
exhibit
themselves
devoid
of
intelligence
with
regard
to
their
most
important
studies
so
as
not
to
seem
to
have
lost
their
time
they
gather
together
many
sheets
of
parchment
make
thick
volumes
of
note
books
out
of
them
with
many
a
blank
interval
and
cover
them
with
elegant
binding
in
red
letters
then
they
return
to
the
paternal
domicile
with
their
little
sack
filled
up
with
knowledge
which
can
be
stolen
from
them
by
any
thief
that
comes
along
or
may
be
eaten
by
rats
or
by
worms
or
destroyed
by
fire
or
water
in
order
to
acquire
instruction
the
student
must
abstain
from
pleasure
and
not
allow
himself
to
be
hampered
by
material
cares
there
was
at
paris
not
long
since
two
teachers
who
were
great
friends
one
of
them
had
seen
much
had
read
much
and
used
to
remain
night
and
day
bent
over
his
books
he
scarcely
took
the
time
to
say
an
father
nevertheless
he
had
but
four
students
his
colleague
possessed
a
much
less
complete
library
was
less
devoted
to
study
and
heard
mass
every
morning
before
delivering
his
lecture
in
spite
of
this
his
classroom
was
full
do
you
do
it
asked
his
friend
is
very
simple
said
his
friend
smiling
studies
for
me
i
go
to
mass
and
when
i
come
back
i
know
by
heart
all
that
i
have
to
teach
meditation
so
sorbonne
continues
is
suitable
not
only
for
the
master
but
the
good
student
ought
also
to
go
and
take
his
promenade
along
the
banks
of
the
seine
not
to
play
there
but
in
order
to
repeat
his
lesson
and
meditate
upon
it
these
instructions
for
students
are
not
very
different
from
those
that
would
be
issued
by
an
interested
head
of
a
university
department
to
the
freshmen
of
the
present
day
his
insistence
especially
on
the
difference
between
reading
and
study
might
very
well
be
taken
to
heart
at
the
present
time
when
there
seems
to
be
some
idea
that
reading
of
itself
is
sufficient
to
enable
one
to
obtain
an
education
the
lesson
of
learning
one
thing
a
day
and
learning
that
well
might
have
been
selected
as
a
motto
for
students
for
all
succeeding
generations
with
manifest
advantage
to
the
success
of
college
study
in
other
things
sorbonne
departs
further
from
our
modern
ideas
in
the
matter
of
education
but
still
there
are
many
even
at
the
present
time
who
will
read
with
profound
sympathy
his
emphatic
advice
to
the
university
students
that
they
must
educate
their
hearts
as
well
as
their
intellects
and
make
their
education
subserve
the
purpose
of
bringing
them
closer
to
god
a
word
about
certain
customs
that
prevailed
more
or
less
generally
in
the
universities
at
this
time
and
that
after
having
been
much
misunderstood
will
now
be
looked
at
more
sympathetically
in
the
light
of
recent
educational
developments
will
not
be
out
of
place
here
one
of
the
advantages
of
modern
german
university
education
has
often
been
acclaimed
to
be
the
fact
that
students
are
tempted
to
make
portions
of
their
studies
in
various
cities
since
all
the
courses
are
equalized
in
certain
ways
so
that
the
time
spent
at
any
one
of
them
will
be
counted
properly
for
their
degrees
it
has
long
been
recognized
that
travel
makes
the
best
possible
complement
to
a
university
course
and
even
when
the
english
universities
in
the
eighteenth
century
sank
to
be
little
more
than
pleasant
abiding
places
where
young
men
of
the
upper
classes
ate
their
terms
the
fact
that
it
was
the
custom
to
make
the
grand
tour
of
continental
travel
supplied
for
much
that
was
lacking
in
the
serious
side
of
their
education
little
as
this
might
be
anticipated
as
a
feature
of
the
ruder
times
of
the
thirteenth
century
when
travel
was
so
difficult
it
must
be
counted
as
one
of
the
great
advantages
for
the
inquiring
spirits
of
the
time
dante
besides
attending
the
universities
in
italy
and
he
certainly
was
at
several
of
them
was
also
at
paris
at
one
time
and
probably
also
at
oxford
professor
monroe
in
his
text
book
in
the
history
of
education
has
stated
this
custom
very
distinctly
with
the
founding
of
the
universities
and
the
establishment
of
the
nations
in
practically
every
university
it
became
quite
customary
for
students
to
travel
from
university
to
university
finding
in
each
a
home
in
their
appropriate
nation
many
however
willing
to
accept
the
privileges
of
the
clergy
and
the
students
without
undertaking
their
obligations
adopted
this
wandering
life
as
a
permanent
one
being
a
privileged
order
they
readily
found
a
living
or
made
it
by
begging
a
monk
of
the
early
university
period
writes
scholars
are
accustomed
to
wander
throughout
the
whole
world
and
visit
all
the
cities
and
their
many
studies
bring
them
understanding
for
in
paris
they
seek
a
knowledge
of
the
liberal
arts
of
the
ancient
writers
at
orleans
of
medicine
at
salernum
of
the
black
art
at
toledo
and
in
no
place
decent
manners
with
regard
to
the
old
monk
criticism
it
must
be
remembered
that
old
age
is
always
rather
depreciative
in
criticism
of
the
present
and
of
what
happened
in
the
past
abuses
always
seem
to
be
creeping
in
that
are
going
to
ruin
the
force
of
education
yet
somehow
the
next
generation
succeeds
in
obtaining
its
intellectual
development
in
rather
good
shape
besides
as
we
must
always
remember
in
educational
questions
evils
are
ever
exaggerated
and
the
memory
of
them
is
prone
to
live
longer
and
to
loom
up
larger
than
that
of
the
good
with
which
they
were
associated
and
to
which
indeed
as
anyone
of
reasonable
experience
in
educational
circles
knows
they
may
constitute
by
comparison
only
a
very
small
amount
undoubtedly
the
wanderings
of
students
brought
with
it
many
abuses
and
if
we
were
to
listen
to
some
of
the
stories
of
foreign
student
life
in
paris
in
our
own
time
we
might
think
that
much
of
evil
and
nothing
of
good
was
accomplished
by
such
wandering
but
inasmuch
as
we
do
so
we
invite
serious
error
of
judgment
another
striking
feature
of
university
life
which
constituted
a
distinct
anticipation
of
something
very
modern
in
our
educational
system
was
the
lending
of
professors
of
different
nationalities
among
the
universities
it
is
only
at
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
that
we
have
reestablished
this
custom
in
the
thirteenth
century
however
albertus
magnus
taught
for
a
time
at
cologne
and
then
later
at
paris
and
apparently
also
at
rome
thomas
of
aquin
after
having
taught
for
a
time
at
paris
lectured
in
various
italian
universities
and
then
finally
at
the
university

which

alexander

to
have

thing
roger
bacon
after
studying
at
the
university
of
paris
seems
to
have
commenced
teaching
there
though
most
of
his
professional
work
was
accomplished
at
the
university
of
oxford
raymond
lully
probably
had
professional
experiences
at
several
spanish
universities
besides
at
paris
in
a
word
if
a
man
were
a
distinguished
genius
he
was
almost
sure
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
influence
his
generation
at
a
number
of
centers
of
educational
life
and
not
be
confined
as
has
been
the
case
in
the
centuries
since
to
but
one
or
at
most
and
that
more
by
accident
than
intent
to
perhaps
two
in
a
word
there
is
not
a
distinctive
feature
of
modern
university
life

was
not

thirteenth

iv
the
number
of
students
and
discipline
for
most
people
the
surprise
of
finding
that
the
subjects
with
which
the
students
were
occupied
at
the
universities
of
the
thirteenth
century
were
very
much
the
same
as
those
which
claim
the
attention
of
modern
students
will
probably
be
somewhat
mitigated
by
the
thought
that
after
all
there
were
only
few
in
attendance
at
the
universities
and
as
a
consequence
only
a
small
proportion
of
the
population
shared
in
that
illumination
which
has
become
so
universal
in
the
spread
of
opportunities
for
the
higher
education
in
these
later
times
while
such
an
impression
is
cherished
by
many
even
of
those
who
think
that
they
know
the
history
of
education
and
unfortunately
are
considered
to
be
authorities
on
the
subject
it
is
the
falsest
possible
idea
that
could
be
conceived
of
this
medieval
time
with
which
we
are
concerned
we
may
say
at
once
that
it
is
a
matter
of
comparatively
easy
collation
of
statistics
to
show
that
in
proportion
to
the
population
of
the
various
countries
there
were
actually
more
students
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
acquire
university
education
in
the
thirteenth
century
than
there
were
at
any
time
in
the
nineteenth
century
or
even
in
the
midst
of
this
era
of
widespread
educational
opportunities
in
the
twentieth
century
most
people
know
the
traditions
which
declare
that
there
were
between
twenty
and
thirty
thousand
students
at
the
university
of
paris
toward
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
at
the
same
time
there
were
said
to
have
been
between
fifteen
and
twenty
thousand
students
at
the
university
of
bologna
correspondingly
large
numbers
have
been
reported
for
the
university
of
oxford
and
many
thousands
were
supposed
to
be
in
attendance
at
the
university
of
cambridge
it
is
usually
considered
however
that
these
figures
are
gross
exaggerations
it
is
easy
to
assert
this
but
rather
difficult
to
prove
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
nearer
one
comes
to
the
actual
times
in
the
history
of
education
the
more
definitely
do
writers
speak
of
these
large
numbers
of
students
in
attendance
for
instance
gascoigne
who
says
that
there
were
thirty
thousand
students
at
the
university
of
oxford
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
lived
himself
within
a
hundred
years
of
the
events
of
which
he
talks
and
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
declare
that
he
saw
the
rolls
of
the
university
containing
this
many
names
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
about
his
evidence
in
the
matter
and
there
is
no
mistake
possible
with
regard
to
his
figures
they
were
written
out
in
latin
not
expressed
in
arabic
or
roman
numerals
the
copying
of
which
might
so
easily
give
opportunities
for
error
to
creep
in
in
spite
of
such
evidence
it
is
generally
conceded
that
to
accept
these
large
numbers
would
be
almost
surely
a
mistake
there
were
without
any
doubt
many
thousands
of
students
at
the
thirteenth
century
universities
there
were
certainly
more
students
at
the
university
of
paris
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
than
there
were
at
any
time
during
the
nineteenth
century
this
of
itself
is
enough
to
startle
modern
complacency
out
of
most
of
its
ridiculous
there
can
be
scarcely
a
doubt
that
the
university
of
bologna
at
the
time
of
its
largest
attendance
had
more
students
than
any
university
of
modern
times
proud
as
we
may
be
and
deservedly
of
our
immense
institutions
of
learning
with
regard
to
the
english
universities
the
presence
of
very
large
numbers
is
much
more
doubtful
making
every
allowance
however
there
can
be
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
oxford
had
during
the
last
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
larger
number
than
ever
afterwards
within
her
walls
and
that
cambridge
though
never
so
numerous
as
her
rival
had
a
like
good
fortune
professor
laurie
of
edinburgh
a
very
conservative
authority
and
one
not
likely
to
concede
too
much
to
the
middle
ages
in
anything
would
allow
as
we
shall
see
some
ten
thousand
students
to
oxford
others
have
claimed
more
than
half
that
number
for
cambridge
as
the
lowest
possible
estimate
even
if
it
be
conceded
as
has
sometimes
been
urged
that
all
those
in
service
in
the
universities
were
also
counted
as
students
these
numbers
would
not
be
reduced
very
materially
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
in
those
days
of
enthusiastic
striving
after
education
young
men
were
perfectly
willing
to
take
up
even
the
onerous
duties
of
personal
services
to
others
in
order
to
have
the
opportunity
to
be
closely
in
touch
with
a
great
educational
institution
and
to
receive
even
a
moderate
amount
of
benefit
from
its
educational
system
in
our
own
time
there
are
many
students
who
are
working
their
way
through
the
universities
and
in
the
thirteenth
century
when
the
spirit
of
independence
was
much
less
developed
and
when
any
stigma
that
attached
to
personal
service
was
much
less
felt
than
it
is
at
the
present
time
there
were
many
more
examples
of
this
earnest
striving
for
intellectual
development
if
we
discuss
the
situation
in
countries
as
regards
the
comparative
attendance
at
the
universities
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
in
our
own
time
we
shall
be
able
to
get
a
reasonably
good
idea
of
what
must
be
thought
in
this
matter
the
authorities
are
neither
difficult
of
consultation
nor
distant
and
comparatively
much
more
is
known
about
the
population
of
england
at
this
time
than
about
most
of
the
continental
countries
england
was
under
a
single
ruler
while
the
geographical
divisions
that
we
now
know
by
the
name
of
france
spain
italy
and
germany
were
the
seats
of
several
rulers
at
least
and
sometimes
of
many
a
circumstance
which
does
not
favor
our
obtaining
an
adequate
idea
of
the
populations
that
but
two
universities
provided
all
the
opportunities
for
whatever
higher
education
there
was
in
england
at
this
time
would
of
itself
seem
to
stamp
the
era
as
backward
in
educational
matters
a
little
consideration
of
the
comparative
number
of
students
with
reference
to
the
population
of
the
country
who
were
thus
given
the
opportunity
for
higher
education
and
took
advantage
of
it
at
that
time
and
the
present
will
show
the
unreasonableness
of
such
an
opinion
it
is
not
so
easy
as
might
be
imagined
to
determine
just
what
was
the
population
even
of
england
in
the
thirteenth
century
during
elizabeth
reign
there
were
according
to
the
census
an
estimate
made
about
the
time
of
the
great
armada
altogether
some
four
millions
of
people
froude
accepts
this
estimate
as
representing
very
well
the
actual
number
of
the
population
certainly
there
were
not
more
than
five
millions
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
lingard
who
for
this
purpose
must
be
considered
as
a
thoroughly
conservative
authority
estimates
that
there
were
not
much
more
than
two
millions
of
people
in
england
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
this
is
probably
not
an
underestimate
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
there
were
not
many
more
than
two
millions
and
a
half
of
people
in
the
country
at
the
very
outside
there
were
let
us
say
three
millions
out
of
this
meagre
population
ten
thousand
students
were
on
the
most
conservative
estimate
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunities
for
the
higher
education
that
were
provided
for
them
at
the
universities
at
the
present
moment
though
we
pride
ourselves
on
the
numbers
in
attendance
at
our
universities
and
though
the
world
population
is
so
much
more
numerous
and
the
means
of
transportation
so
much
more
easy
we
have
very
few
universities
as
large
as
these
of
the
thirteenth
century
no
american
university
at
the
present
moment
has
as
large
a
number
of
students
as
had
oxford
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
of
course
none
of
them
compares
at
all
with
paris
or
bologna
in
this
respect
even
the
european
universities
as
we
have
suggested
fall
behind
their
former
glory
from
this
standpoint
in
the
attendance
to
the
number
of
population
the
comparison
is
even
more
startling
for
those
who
have
not
thought
at
all
of
the
middle
ages
as
a
time
of
wonderful
educational
facilities
and
opportunities
in
the
greater
city
of
new
york
as
we
begin
the
twentieth
century
there
are
perhaps
fifteen
thousand
students
in
attendance
at
educational
institutions
which
have
university
privileges
i
may
say
that
this
is
a
very
liberal
allowance
at
universities
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
there
are
not
more
than
ten
thousand
students
and
the
remainder
is
added
in
order
surely
to
include
all
those
who
may
be
considered
as
doing
undergraduate
work
in
colleges
and
schools
of
various
kinds
of
these
fifteen
thousand
at
least
come
from
outside
of
the
greater
city
and
there
are
some
who
think
that
even
would
not
be
too
large
a
number
to
calculate
as
not
being
drawn
directly
from
our
own
population
connecticut
and
new
jersey
furnish
large
numbers
of
students
and
then
besides
the
schools
of
the
universities
have
very
large
numbers
in
attendance
even
from
distant
states
and
foreign
countries
it
will
be
within
the
bounds
of
truth
then
to
say
that
there
are
between
ten
and
twelve
thousand
students
out
of
our
population
of
more
than
four
millions
in
greater
new
york
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunities
for
the
higher
education
provided
by
our
universities
and
colleges
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
england
there
were
at
least
ten
thousand
students
out
of
a
population
of
not
more
and
very
probably
less
than
three
millions
who
were
glad
to
avail
themselves
of
similar
opportunities
this
seems
to
be
perfectly
fair
comparison
and
we
have
tried
to
be
as
conservative
as
possible
in
every
way
in
order
to
bring
out
the
truth
in
the
matter
it
can
scarcely
fail
to
be
a
matter
of
supreme
surprise
to
find
that
a
century
so
distant
as
the
thirteenth
should
thus
equal
our
own
vaunted
twentieth
century
in
the
matter
of
opportunities
for
the
higher
education
afforded
and
taken
advantage
of
it
has
always
been
presumed
that
the
middle
ages
while
a
little
better
than
the
dark
ages
were
typical
periods
in
which
there
was
little
if
any
desire
for
higher
education
and
even
fewer
opportunities
it
was
thought
that
there
was
constant
repression
of
the
desire
for
knowledge
which
springs
so
eternally
in
the
human
heart
and
that
the
church
or
at
least
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
of
the
time
set
themselves
firmly
against
widespread
education
because
it
would
set
people
to
thinking
for
themselves
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
every
cathedral
and
every
monastery
became
a
center
of
educational
influence
and
even
the
poorest
who
showed
special
signs
of
talent
obtained
the
opportunity
to
secure
knowledge
to
the
degree
that
they
wished
it
is
beyond
doubt
or
cavil
that
at
no
time
in
the
world
history
have
so
many
opportunities
for
the
higher
education
been
open
to
all
classes
as
during
the
thirteenth
century
in
order
to
show
how
thoroughly
conservative
are
the
numbers
in
attendance
at
the
universities
that
i
have
taken
i
shall
quote
two
good
recent
authorities
one
of
them
professor
laurie
the
professor
of
the
institutes
and
history
of
education
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
the
other
thomas
davidson
a
american
authority
on
educational
subjects
each
of
their
works
from
which
i
shall
quote
has
been
published
or
revised
within
the
last
few
years
professor
laurie
in
the
rise
and
early
constitution
of
the
university
with
a
survey
of
the
medieval
education
which
formed
one
of
the
international
educational
series
edited
by
commissioner
harris
and
published
by
appleton
said
when
one
hears
of
the
large
number
of
students
who
attended
the
earliest
universities
ten
thousand
and
even
twenty
thousand
at
bologna
an
equal
and
at
one
time
a
greater
number
at
paris
and
thirty
thousand
at
oxford
one
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
numbers
have
been
exaggerated
there
is
certainly
evidence
that
the
oxford
attendance
was
never
so
great
as
has
been
alleged
see
anstey
acad
but
when
we
consider
that
attendants
servitors
college
cooks
were
regarded
as
members
of
the
university
community
and
that
the
universities
provided
for
a
time
the
sole
recognized
training
grounds
for
those
wishing
to
enter
the
ecclesiastical
or
legal
or
teaching
professions
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
the
substantial
accuracy
of
the
tradition
as
to
attendance
especially
when
we
remember
that
at
paris
and
oxford
a
large
number
were
mere
boys
of
from
twelve
to
fifteen
years
of
age
as
to
the
inclusion
of
servitors
we
have
already
said
that
many
probably
indeed
most
of
them
were
actual
students
working
their
way
through
the
university
in
these
enthusiastic
days
professor
authority
for
the
assertion
that
a
large
number
of
the
students
at
paris
and
oxford
were
mere
boys
is
a
regulation
known
to
have
existed
at
one
of
these
universities
requiring
that
students
should
not
be
less
than
twelve
years
of
age
anyone
who
has
studied
medieval
university
life
however
will
have
been
impressed
with
the
idea
that
the
students
were
on
the
average
older
at
the
medieval
universities
rather
than
younger
than
they
are
at
the
present
time
the
rough
hazing
methods
employed
almost
equal
to
those
of
our
own
day
would
seem
to
indicate
this
besides
as
professor
laurie
confesses
in
the
next
paragraph
many
of
the
students
were
actually
much
older
than
at
present
our
university
courses
are
arranged
for
young
men
between
and
but
that
is
to
fall
back
on
herbert
spencer
presumably
because
the
period
of
infancy
is
lengthening
with
the
evolution
of
the
race
there
are
many
who
consider
that
at
the
present
time
students
are
too
long
delayed
in
the
opportunity
to
get
at
the
professional
studies
and
that
it
is
partly
the
consequence
of
this
that
the
practical
branches
are
so
much
more
taken
up
under
the
elective
system
as
we
said
in
the
chapter
on
universities
and
preparatory
schools
in
italy
and
in
other
southern
countries
it
is
not
a
surprising
thing
to
have
a
young
man
graduate
at
the
age
of
or
with
his
degree
of
a
after
a
thoroughly
creditable
scholastic
career
this
means
that
he
began
his
university
work
proper
under
years
of
age
so
that
we
must
judge
the
medieval
universities
to
some
extent
at
least
with
this
thought
in
mind
thomas
davidson
in
his
history
of
education
footnote
in
the
chapter
on
the
medieval
university
has
a
paragraph
in
which
he
discusses
the
attendance
especially
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
admits
that
the
numbers
while
perhaps
not
so
large
as
have
been
reported
were
very
large
in
comparison
to
modern
institutions
of
the
same
kind
and
frankly
concedes
that
education
rose
during
these
centuries
which
are
often
supposed
to
have
been
so
unfavorable
to
educational
development
to
an
amazing
height
scarcely
ever
surpassed
he
says
footnote
a
history
of
education
by
thomas
davidson
author
of
aristotle
and
ancient
educational
ideas
new
york
scribners
the
number
of
students
reported
as
having
attended
some
of
the
universities
in
those
early
days
almost
passes
belief
oxford
is
said
to
have
had
thirty
thousand
about
the
year
and
half
that
number
even
as
early
as
the
numbers
attending
the
university
of
paris
were
still
greater
these
numbers
become
less
surprising
when
we
remember
with
what
poor
accommodations
a
bare
room
and
an
armful
of
straw
the
students
of
those
days
were
content
and
what
numbers
of
them
even
a
single
teacher
like
abelard
could
long
before
draw
into
lonely
retreats
that
in
the
twelfth
and
following
centuries
there
was
no
lack
of
enthusiasm
for
study
notwithstanding
the
troubled
condition
of
the
times
is
very
clear
the
instruction
given
at
the
universities
moreover
reacted
upon
the
lower
schools
raising
their
standard
and
supplying
them
with
competent
teachers
thus
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
education
rose
in
many
european
states
to
a
height
which
it
had
not
attained
since

days

a
very
serious
objection
that
would
seem
to
have
so
much
weight
as
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
accepting
as
true
the
large
numbers
mentioned
is
the
fact
that
it
is
very
hard
to
understand
how
such
an
immense
number
of
students
could
have
been
supported
in
any
town
of
the
middle
ages
this
objection
has
carried
so
much
weight
to
some
minds
as
to
make
them
give
up
the
thought
of
large
numbers
at
the
medieval
universities
professor
laurie
has
answered
it
very
effectively
however
and
in
his
plausible
explanation
gives
a
number
of
points
which
emphasize
the
intense
ardor
of
these
students
of
the
middle
ages
in
their
search
for
knowledge
and
shows
how
ready
they
were
to
bear
serious
trials
and
inconveniences
not
to
say
absolute
sufferings
and
hardships
in
order
that
they
might
have
opportunities
for
the
higher
education
the
objection
then
redounds
rather
to
the
glory
of
the
medieval
universities
than
lessens
their
prestige
either
as
regards
numbers
or
the
enthusiasm
of
their
students
the
chief
objection
to
accepting
the
tradition
of
large
numbers
at
the
universities
lies
in
the
difficulty
of
seeing
how
in
those
days
so
large
a
number
of
the
young
men
of
europe
could
afford
the
expense
of
residence
away
from
their
homes
this
difficulty
however
is
partly
removed
when
we
know
that
many
of
the
students
were
well
to
do
that
a
considerable
number
were
matured
men
already
monks
and
canons
and
that
the
endowments
of
cathedral
schools
also
were
frequently
used
to
enable
promising
scholars
to
attend
foreign
universities
monasteries
also
regularly
sent
boys
of
thirteen
and
fourteen
to
university
seats
a
papal
instruction
of
required
every
benedictine
and
augustinian
community
to
send
boys
to
the
universities
in
the
proportion
of
one
in
twenty
of
their
residents
then
state
authorities
ordered
free
passages
for
all
who
were
wending
their
way
through
the
country
to
and
from
the
seat
of
learning
in
the
houses
of
country
priests
not
to
speak
of
the
monastery
hospitals
traveling
scholars
were
always
accommodated
gratuitously
and
even
local
subscriptions
were
frequently
made
to
help
them
on
their
way
poor
traveling
scholars
were
in
fact
a
medieval
institution
and
it
was
considered
no
disgrace
for
a
student
to
beg
and
receive
alms
for
his
support
after
reading
these
authoritative
opinions
it
would
be
rather
difficult
to
understand
the
false
impressions
which
have
obtained
so
commonly
for
the
last
three
centuries
with
regard
to
education
in
the
middle
ages
if
we
did
not
realize
that
history
especially
for
people
has
for
several
centuries
been
written
from
a
very
narrow
standpoint
and
with
a
very
definite
purpose
about
a
century
ago
the
comte
de
maistre
said
in
his
soirées
de
petersburg
that
history
for
the
three
hundred
years
before
his
time
had
been
a
conspiracy
against
the
truth
curiously
enough
the
editors
of
the
cambridge
modern
history
in
their
first
volume
on
the
renaissance
this
sentiment
of
the
french
historical
writer
and
philosopher
they
even
use
the
very
words
history
has
been
a
conspiracy
against
the
truth
and
proclaim
that
if
we
are
to
get
at
truth
in
this
generation
we
must
go
behind
all
the
classical
historians
and
look
up
contemporary
documents
and
evidence
and
authorities
once
more
for
ourselves
it
is
the
maintenance
of
a
tradition
that
nothing
good
could
possibly
have
come
out
of
the
nazareth
of
the
times
before
the
reformation
that
has
led
to
this
serious
misapprehension
of
the
true
position
of
those
extremely
important
centuries
in
modern
education
the
thirteenth
and
the
fourteenth
to
those
who
know
even
a
little
of
what
was
accomplished
in
these
centuries
it
is
supremely
amusing
to
read
the
childish
treatment
accorded
them
and
the
trivial
remarks
that
even
accredited
historians
of
education
make
with
regard
to
them
occasionally
however
the
feeling
of
the
reader
who
knows
something
of
the
subject
is
not
one
of
amusement
but
far
from
it
there
are
times
when
one
can
not
help
but
feel
that
it
is
not
ignorance
but
a
deliberate
purpose
to
minimize
the
importance
of
these
times
in
culture
and
education
that
is
at
the
basis
of
some
of
the
utterly
mistaken
remarks
that
are
made
we
shall
take
occasion
only
to
give
one
example
of
this
but
that
will
afford
ample
evidence
of
the
intolerant
spirit
that
characterizes
the
work
of
some
even
of
the
supposedly
most
enlightened
historians
of
education
the
quotation
will
be
from
compayré
history
of
pedagogy
which
is
i
understand
in
use
in
nearly
every
normal
school
in
this
country
and
is
among
the
books
required
in
many
normal
school
examinations
compayré
in
an
infamous
paragraph
which
bears
the
title
the
intellectual
feebleness
of
the
middle
age
furnishes
an
excellent
example
of
how
utterly
misunderstood
if
not
deliberately
misrepresented
has
been
the
whole
spirit
and
content
and
the
real
progressiveness
of
education
in
this
wonderful
period
after
some
belittling
expressions
as
to
the
influence
of
christianity
on
education
expressions
utterly
unjustified
by
the
facts
he
has
this
to
say
with
regard
to
the
thirteenth
century
which
is
all
the
more
surprising
because
it
is
the
only
place
where
he
calls
any
attention
to
it
he
says
in
of
all
the
monks
in
the
convent
of
gall
there
was
not
one
who
could
read
and
write
it
was
so
difficult
to
find
notaries
public
that
acts
had
to
be
passed
verbally
the
barons
took
pride
in
their
ignorance
even
after
the
efforts
of
the
twelfth
century
instruction
remained
a
luxury
for
the
common
people
it
was
the
privilege
of
the
ecclesiastics
and
even
they
did
not
carry
it
very
far
the
benedictines
confess
that
the
mathematics
were
studied
only
for
the
purpose
of
calculating
the
date
of
easter
this
whole
paragraph
of
compayré
the
rest
must
be
read
to
be
appreciated
whose
history
of
education
was
considered
to
be
of
such
value
that
it
was
deemed
worthy
of
translation
by
the
president
of
a
state
normal
school
and
that
it
has
been
adopted
as
a
work
of
reference
in
some
cases
of
required
study
in
many
of
the
normal
schools
throughout
the
country
is
a
most
wonderful
concoction
of
ingredients
all
of
which
are
meant
to
dissolve
every
possible
idea
that
people
might
have
of
the
existence
of
any
tincture
of
education
during
the
middle
ages
there
is
only
one
fact
which
deeply
concerns
us
because
it
refers
to
the
thirteenth
century
compayré
says
that
in
of
all
the
monks
of
the
convent
of
saint
gall
there
was
not
one
who
could
read
and
write
this
single
fact
is
meant
to
sum
up
the
education
of
the
century
for
the
reader
especially
it
is
meant
to
show
the
student
of
pedagogy
how
deeply
sunk
in
ignorance
were
the
monks
and
all
the
ecclesiastics
of
this
period
before
attempting
to
say
anything
further
it
may
be
as
well
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
original
french
edition
the
writer
did
not
say
that
there
was
not
a
single
monk
he
said
there
was
but
one
monk
who
could
read
and
write
possibly
it
seemed
to
the
translator
to
make
the
story
more
complete
to
leave
out
this
one
poor
monk
and
perhaps
one
monk
more
or
less
especially
a
medieval
monk
may
not
count
for
very
much
to
modern
students
of
education
there
are
those
of
us
however
who
consider
it
too
bad
to
obliterate
even
a
single
monk
in
this
crude
way
and
we
ask
that
he
shall
be
put
back
there
who
could
read
and
write
and
carry
on
the
affairs
of
the
monastery
let
us
have
him
at
least
by
all
means
in
the
year
when
compayré
says
that
there
was
but
a
single
monk
at
the
monastery
of
gall
who
could
read
and
write
he
a
professor
himself
at
a
french
normal
school
must
have
known
very
well
that
there
were
over
twenty
thousand
students
at
the
university
of
paris
almost
as
many
at
the
university
of
bologna
and
over
five
thousand
some
authorities
say
many
more
than
this
professor
laurie
would
admit
more
than
ten
thousand
at
the
university
of
oxford
though
all
christian
europe
at
this
time
did
not
have
a
population
of
more
than
people
he
must
have
known
too
or
be
hopelessly
ignorant
in
educational
matters
that
many
of
the
students
at
these
universities
belonged
to
the
franciscans
and
dominicans
and
that
indeed
many
of
the
greatest
teachers
at
the
universities
were
members
of
these
monastic
orders
of
this
he
says
nothing
however
all
that
he
says
is
education
was
the
privilege
of
the
ecclesiastics
and
they
did
not
carry
it
very
far
this
is
one
way
of
writing
a
history
of
education
it
is
a
very
effective
way
of
poisoning
the
wells
of
information
and
securing
the
persistence
of
the
tradition
that
there
was
no
education
until
after
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
meantime
one
can
scarcely
help
but
admire
the
ingenuity
of
deliberate
purpose
that
uses
the
condition
of
the
monastery
of
gall
to
confirm
his
statement
gall
had
been
founded
by
irish
monks
probably
about
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
century
it
had
been
for
at
least
three
centuries
a
center
of
education
civilization
and
culture
as
well
as
of
religion
for
the
barbarians
who
had
settled
in
the
swiss
country
after
the
of
nations
the
irish
had
originally
obtained
their
culture
from
christian
missionaries
and
now
as
christian
missionaries
they
brought
it
back
to
europe
and
accomplished
their
work
with
wonderful
effectiveness
gall
was
for
centuries
a
lasting
monument
to
their
efforts
after
the
tenth
century
however
the
monastery
began
to
degenerate
it
was
almost
directly
in
the
path
of
armies
which
so
frequently
went
down
to
italy
because
of
the
german
interest
in
the
italian
peninsula
and
the
claims
of
the
german
emperor
after
a
time
according
to
tradition
the
emperor
insisted
that
certain
of
the
veterans
of
his
army
should
be
received
and
cared
for
in
their
old
age
at
gall
gradually
this
feature
of
the
institution
became
more
and
more
prominent
until
in
the
thirteenth
century
it
had
become
little
more
than
a
home
for
old
soldiers
in
order
to
live
on
the
benefices
of
the
monastery
these
men
had
to
submit
to
ecclesiastical
regulations
and
wear
the
habit
they
were
it
is
true
a
sort
of
monk
that
is
they
were
willing
for
the
sake
of
the
peace
and
ease
which
it
brought
to
accept
the
living
thus
provided
for
them
and
obey
to
some
degree
at
least
the
rules
of
the
monastery
it
is
not
surprising
that
among
these
there
should
have
been
only
one
who
could
read
and
write
the
soldiers
of
the
time
despised
the
men
of
letters
and
prided
themselves
on
not
being
able
to
write
that
a
historian
of
pedagogy
however
should
take
this
one
fact
in
order
to
give
students
an
idea
of
the
depth
of
ignorance
of
the
middle
ages
is
an
exhibition
of
some
qualities
in
our
modern
educated
men
that
one
does
not
like
to
think
of
as
compatible
with
the
capacity
to
read
and
write
it
would
indeed
be
better
not
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
than
thus
to
read
and
write
one
own
prejudices
into
history
and
above
all
the
history
of
education
compayré
discussion
of
the
causes
of
the
ignorance
of
the
middle
ages
in
the
next
paragraph
is
one
of
the
most
curious
bits
of
special
pleading
by
a
man
who
holds
a
brief
for
one
side
of
the
question
that
i
think
has
ever
been
seen
in
what
was
to
be
considered
serious
history
he
first
makes
it
clear
how
much
opposed
the
christian
church
was
to
education
then
he
admits
that
she
did
some
things
which
can
not
be
denied
but
minimizes
their
significance
then
he
concludes
that
it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
church
but
in
this
there
is
a
precious
bit
of
damning
by
faint
praise
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
ordinary
person
who
had
only
compayré
for
authority
to
feel
anything
after
reading
the
paragraph
but
that
christianity
was
a
serious
detriment
and
surely
not
a
help
to
the
cause
of
progress
in
education
i
quote
part
of
the
paragraph
what
were
the
permanent
causes
of
that
situation
which
lasted
for
ten
centuries
the
catholic
church
has
sometimes
been
held
responsible
for
this
doubtless
the
christian
doctors
did
not
always
profess
a
very
warm
sympathy
for
intellectual
culture
saint
augustine
has
said
it
is
the
ignorant
who
gain
possession
of
heaven
indocti

saint
gregory
the
great
a
pope
of
the
sixth
century
declared
that
he
would
blush
to
have
the
holy
word
conform
to
the
rules
of
grammar
too
many
christians
in
a
word
confounded
ignorance
with
holiness
doubtless
towards
the
seventh
century
the
darkness
still
hung
thick
over
the
christian
church
barbarians
invaded
the
episcopate
and
carried
with
them
their
rude
manners
doubtless
also
during
the
feudal
period
the
priest
often
became
a
soldier
and
remained
ignorant
it
would
however
be
unjust
to
bring
a
constructive
charge
against
the
church
of
the
middle
age
and
to
represent
it
as
systematically
hostile
to
instruction
directly
to
the
contrary
it
is
the
clergy
who
in
the
midst
of
the
general
barbarism
preserved
some
vestiges
of
the
ancient
culture
the
only
schools
of
that
period
are
the
episcopal
and
claustral
schools
the
first
annexed
to
the
bishops
palaces
the
second
to
the
monasteries
the
religious
orders
voluntarily
associated
manual
labor
with
mental
labor
as
far
back
as
benedict
founded
the
convent
of
monte
cassino
and
drew
up
statutes
which
made
reading
and
intellectual
labor
a
part
of
the
daily
life
of
the
monks
when
this
damning
by
faint
praise
is
taken
in
connection
with
the
paragraph
in
which
only
a
single
monk
at
the
monastery
of
gall
is
declared
to
have
been
able
to
read
and
write
the
utterly
false
impression
that
is
sure
to
result
can
be
readily
understood
even
by
those
who
are
not
sympathetic
students
of
the
middle
ages
this
is
how
our
histories
of
education
have
been
written
as
a
rule
and
as
a
consequence
the
most
precious
period
in
modern
education
its
great
origin
has
been
ignored
even
by
professional
scholars
to
the
great
detriment
not
only
of
historical
knowledge
but
also
of
any
proper
appreciation
of
the
evolution
of
education

it
will
be
said
by
those
who
do
not
appreciate
the
conditions
that
existed
in
the
middle
ages
that
these
numbers
at
the
universities
seeking
the
higher
education
mean
very
little
for
the
culture
of
the
people
since
practically
all
of
those
in
attendance
at
the
universities
belonged
to
the
clerical
order
there
is
no
doubt
that
most
students
were
clerics
in
the
thirteenth
century
this
did
not
mean
however
that
they
had
taken
major
orders
or
had
in
any
way
bound
themselves
irrevocably
to
continue
in
the
clerical
vocation
the
most
surprising
thing
about
the
spread
of
culture
and
the
desire
for
the
higher
education
during
the
thirteenth
century
is
that
they
developed
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
rulers
of
the
time
were
all
during
the
century
embroiled
in
war
either
with
their
neighbors
or
with
the
nobility
anyone
who
wanted
to
live
a
quiet
intellectual
life
turned
naturally
to
the
clerical
state
which
enabled
him
to
escape
military
duties
and
gave
him
opportunities
for
study
as
well
as
protection
from
many
exactions
that
might
otherwise
be
levied
upon
him
the
church
not
only
encouraged
education
but
supplied
the
peaceful
asylums
in
which
it
might
be
cultivated
to
the
content
of
the
student
while
this
clerical
state
was
a
necessity
during
the
whole
time
of
residence
at
the
university
it
was
not
necessarily
maintained
afterward
many
of
the
clerics
did
not
even
have
minor
orders
orders
which
it
is
well
understood
carry
with
them
no
absolute
obligation
of
continuing
in
the
clerical
state
sextons
and
their
assistants
were
clerics
when
the
word
canon
originally
came
into
use
it
meant
nothing
more
than
that
the
man
was
entered
on
the
rolls
of
a
church
and
received
some
form
of
wages
therefrom
students
at
the
universities
were
by
ecclesiastical
courtesy
then
clerics
from
which
comes
the
word
clerk
one
who
can
read
and
write
though
not
in
orders
and
it
was
because
of
this
that
the
university
was
able
to
maintain
the
rights
of
students
it
was
well
understood
that
after
graduation
men
might
take
up
the
secular
life
and
indeed
most
of
them
did
in
succeeding
chapters
we
shall
see
examples
of
this
and
discuss
the
question
further
professors
at
the
universities
had
to
maintain
their
clerical
condition
so
that
even
professors
of
law
and
of
medicine
were
not
allowed
to
marry
this
law
continued
long
beyond
the
thirteenth
century
however
professors
of
medicine
were
the
first
to
be
freed
from
the
obligation
of
celibacy
but
not
until
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
at
paris
while
other
professors
were
bound
thus
for
a
full
century
later
certain
minor
teaching
positions
at
oxford
are
still
under
this
law
which
evidently
has
seemed
to
have
some
advantage
or
it
would
not
have
been
maintained
it
might
perhaps
be
thought
that
only
the
wealthier
class
the
sons
of
the
nobility
and
of
the
wealthy
merchants
of
the
cities
had
opportunities
at
the
universities
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
the
vast
majority
of
the
students
was
drawn
from
the
great
middle
class
the
nobility
were
nearly
always
too
occupied
with
their
pleasures
and
their
martial
duties
to
have
time
for
the
higher
education
the
tradition
that
a
nobleman
should
be
an
educated
gentleman
had
not
yet
come
in
indeed
many
of
the
nobility
during
the
thirteenth
century
rather
prided
themselves
on
the
fact
that
they
not
only
had
no
higher
education
but
that
they
did
not
know
even
how
to
read
and
write
when
we
reflect
then
on
the
large
numbers
who
went
to
the
universities
it
adds
to
our
surprise
to
realize
that
they
were
drawn
from
the
burgher
class
it
is
evident
that
many
of
the
sons
even
of
the
poor
were
afforded
opportunities
in
different
ways
at
the
universities
of
the
time
tradition
shows
that
from
the
earliest
time
there
were
foundations
on
which
poor
students
could
live
and
various
arrangements
were
made
by
which
aside
from
these
they
might
make
their
living
while
continuing
their
studies
working
one
way
through
the
university
was
more
common
in
the
thirteenth
century
than
it
is
at
the
present
day
though
we
are
proud
of
the
large
numbers
who
now
succeed
in
the
double
task
of
supporting
and
educating
themselves
with
excellent
success
in
both
enterprises
there
are
many
stories
of
poor
students
who
found
themselves
about
to
be
obliged
to
give
up
their
studies
encountering
patrons
of
various
kinds
who
enabled
them
to
go
on
with
their
education
there
is
a
very
pretty
set
of
legends
with
regard
to
edmund
of
canterbury
in
this
matter
he
bears
this
name
because
he
was
afterward
the
sainted
primate
of
england
for
many
years
he
taught
at
the
university
of
oxford
the
story
is
told
of
a
clerical
friend
sending
him
up
a
student
to
oxford
and
asking
that
his
bills
be
sent
to
him
edmund
answer
was
that
he
would
not
be
robbed
of
an
opportunity
of
doing
good
like
this
and
he
took
upon
himself
the
burden
of
caring
for
the
student
at
the
time
there
were
many
others
dependent
on
his
bounty
and
his
reputation
was
such
that
he
was
enabled
to
help
a
great
many
through
the
benefactions
of
friends
who
found
no
higher
pleasure
in
life
than
being
able
to
come
generously
to
edmund
assistance
in
his
charities
those
who
know
the
difficulty
of
managing
very
large
bodies
of
students
will
wonder
inevitably
how
the
medieval
universities
with
their
less
formal
and
less
complete
organizations
succeeded
in
maintaining
discipline
for
all
these
thousands
of
students
most
people
will
remember
at
once
all
the
stories
of
roughness
of
horse
play
of
drinking
and
gaming
or
worse
that
they
have
heard
of
the
medieval
students
and
will
be
apt
to
conclude
that
they
are
not
to
be
wondered
at
after
all
since
it
must
have
been
practically
impossible
for
the
faculties
of
universities
to
keep
order
among
such
vast
numbers
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
the
story
of
the
origin
and
maintenance
of
discipline
in
these
universities
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
university
life
the
process
of
discipline
became
in
itself
a
very
precious
part
of
education
as
it
should
be
of
course
in
any
well
regulated
institution
of
learning
the
very
fact
moreover
that
in
spite
of
these
large
numbers
and
other
factors
that
we
shall
call
attention
to
in
a
moment
comparatively
so
few
disgraceful
stories
of
university
life
have
come
down
to
us
and
the
other
and
still
more
important
fact
that
the
universities
could
be
kept
so
constantly
at
the
attainment
of
their
great
purpose
for
such
numbers
is
itself
a
magnificent
tribute
to
those
who
succeeded
in
doing
it
and
to
the
system
which
was
gradually
evolved
not
by
the
faculty
alone
but
by
teachers
and
students
for
university
government
with
regard
to
the
discipline
of
the
medieval
universities
not
much
is
known
and
considerable
of
what
has
been
written
on
this
obscure
subject
wears
an
unfavorable
tinge
because
it
is
unfortunately
true
that
the
good
men
do
is
oft
interred
with
their
bones
while
the
evil
has
an
immortality
all
its
own
the
student
escapades
of
the
universities
the
quarrels
between
town
and
gown
the
stories
of
the
evils
apparently
inevitable
where
many
young
men
are
congregated
the
hazing
the
rough
horse
play
the
carousing
the
immoralities
have
all
come
down
to
us
while
it
is
easy
to
miss
the
supreme
significance
of
the
enthusiasm
for
learning
that
in
these
difficult
times
gathered
so
many
students
together
from
distant
parts
of
the
world
when
traveling
was
so
difficult
and
dangerous
and
kept
them
at
the
universities
for
long
years
in
spite
of
the
hardships
and
inconveniences
of
the
life
with
regard
to
our
modern
universities
the
same
thing
is
true
and
the
outside
world
knows
much
more
of
the
escapades
of
the
few
the
little
scandals
of
college
life
that
scarcely
make
a
ripple
but
are
so
easily
exaggerated
and
so
frequently
repeated
and
lose
nothing
by
repetition
the
waste
of
time
in
athletics
in
gambling
in
social
things
than
of
the
earnest
work
and
the
successful
intellectual
progress
and
interests
of
the
many
this
should
be
quite
enough
to
make
the
modern
university
man
very
slow
to
accept
the
supposed
pictures
of
medieval
student
life
which
are
founded
mainly
on
the
worse
side
of
it
goodness
is
proverbially
uninteresting
a
happy
people
has
no
history
and
the
ordinary
life
of
the
university
student
needs
a
patient
sympathetic
chronicler
and
such
the
medieval
universities
have
not
found
as
yet
but
they
do
not
need
many
allowances
if
it
will
only
be
remembered
under
what
discouragements
they
labored
and
how
much
they
accomplished
the
reputation
of
the
medieval
universities
has
suffered
from
this
very
human
tendency
to
be
interested
in
what
is
evil
and
to
neglect
the
good
even
as
it
is
however
a
good
deal
with
regard
to
the
discipline
of
the
universities
in
the
early
times
is
known
and
does
not
lose
in
interest
from
the
fact
that
the
main
factor
in
it
was
a
committee
of
the
students
themselves
working
in
conjunction
with
the
faculty
and
thus
anticipating
what
is
most
modern
in
the
development
of
the
disciplinary
regime
of
our
universities
at
first
apparently
in
the
schools
from
which
the
universities
originated
there
was
no
thought
of
the
necessity
for
discipline
the
desire
for
education
was
considered
to
be
sufficient
to
keep
men
occupied
in
such
a
way
that
further
discipline
would
not
be
necessary
it
can
readily
be
understood
that
the
crowds
that
flocked
to
hear
abelard
in
paris
and
who
were
sufficiently
interested
to
follow
him
out
to
the
desert
of
the
paraclete
when
he
was
no
longer
allowed
to
continue
his
lectures
in
connection
with
the
school
at
paris
would
have
quite
enough
of
ruling
from
the
internal
forum
of
their
supreme
interest
not
to
need
any
discipline
in
the
external
forum
in
the
course
of
time
however
with
the
coming
of
even
greater
numbers
to
the
university
of
paris
and
especially
when
the
attendance
ran
up
into
many
thousands
some
form
of
school
discipline
became
an
absolute
necessity
this
developed
of
itself
and
in
a
very
practical
way
the
masters
seem
to
have
had
very
little
to
do
with
it
at
the
beginning
since
they
occupied
themselves
entirely
with
their
teaching
and
preparation
for
lectures
what
was
to
become
later
one
of
the
principal
instruments
of
discipline
was
at
first
scarcely
more
than
a
social
organization
among
the
students
those
who
came
from
different
countries
were
naturally
attracted
to
one
another
and
were
more
ready
to
help
each
other
when
students
first
came
they
were
welcomed
by
their
compatriots
who
took
care
to
keep
them
from
being
imposed
upon
enabled
them
to
secure
suitable
quarters
and
introduced
them
to
university
customs
generally
so
that
they
might
be
able
to
take
advantage
as
soon
as
possible
of
the
educational
opportunities
the
friendships
thus
fostered
gradually
grew
into
formal
organizations
the
nations
these
began
to
take
form
just
before
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
they
made
it
their
duty
to
find
lodgings
for
their
student
compatriots
and
evidently
also
to
supply
food
on
some
cooperative
plan
for
at
least
the
poorer
students
whenever
students
of
a
particular
nationality
were
injured
in
any
way
their
nation
as
a
formal
organization
took
up
their
cause
and
maintained
their
rights
even
to
the
extent
of
an
appeal
to
formal
process
of
law
before
the
magistrates
if
necessary
the
nations
were
organized
before
the
faculties
in
the
universities
were
formally
recognized
as
independent
divisions
of
the
institution
and
they
acted
as
intermediaries
between
the
university
head
and
the
students
making
themselves
responsible
for
discipline
to
no
slight
degree
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
paris
all
the
students
belonged
to
one
or
other
of
four
nations
the
picard
the
norman
the
french
which
embraced
italians
spaniards
greeks
and
orientals
and
the
english
which
embraced
the
english
irish
germans
poles

the

elected
its

and
the

was
represented
it
is
true
by
the

but
the
deans
of
the
subdivisions
were
regarded
as
important
officials
and
were
frequently
if
not
always
assessors
of
the
procurators
the
procurators
four
in
number
were
elected
not
by
the
students
as
in
bologna
and
padua
but
by
the
students
and
masters
each
nation
with
its
procurator
and
deans
was
an
independent
body
passing
its
own
statutes
and
rules
and
exercising
supervision
over
the
of
the
students
they
had
each
a
seal
as
distinguished
from
the
university
seal
and
each
procurator
stood
to
his
nation
in
the
same
relation
as
the
rector
did
to
the
whole
university
the
rector
again
was
elected
by
the
procurators
who
sat
as
his
assessors
and
together
they
constituted
the
governing
body
but
this
for
purposes
of
discipline
protection
and
defense
of
privileges
chiefly
the
regulating
the
schools
but
so
independent
were
the
nations
that
the
question
whether
each
had
power
to
make
statutes
that
overrode
those
of
the
was
still
a
question
so
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
is
typical
of
the
times
that
the
governing
system
should
thus
have
grown
up
of
itself
and
from
amongst
the
students
rather
than
that
it
should
have
been
organized
by
the
teachers
and
imposed
upon
the
university
the
nations
represented
the
rise
of
that
democratic
spirit
which
was
to
make
itself
felt
in
the
claims
for
the
recognition
of
rights
for
all
the
people
in
most
of
the
countries
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
undoubtedly
the
character
of
the
government
of
the
student
body
at
the
universities
fostered
this
spirit
and
is
therefore
to
a
noteworthy
degree
responsible
for
the
advances
in
the
direction
of
liberty
which
are
chronicled
during
this
great
century
this
was
a
form
of
unconscious
education
but
none
the
less
significant
for
that
and
eminently
practical
in
its
results
at
this
time
in
europe
there
was
no
place
where
the
members
of
the
community
who
flocked
in
largest
numbers
to
the
universities
the
sons
of
the
middle
classes
could
have
any
opportunities
to
share
in
government
or
learn
the
precious
lessons
of
such
participation
except
at
the
universities
there
gradually
came
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
faculties
to
lessen
many
of
the
rights
of
the
nations
of
the
universities
but
the
very
struggle
to
maintain
these
on
the
part
of
the
student
body
was
of
itself
a
precious
training
against
the
usurpation
of
privileges
that
was
to
be
of
great
service
later
in
the
larger
arena
of
national
politics
and
the
effects
of
which
can
be
noted
in
every
country
in
europe
nowhere
more
than
in
england
where
the
development
of
law
and
liberty
was
to
give
rise
to
a
supreme
heritage
of
democratic
jurisprudence
for
the
english
speaking
peoples
of
all
succeeding
generations
v
work
at
the
universities
in
modern
times
it
has
often
been
said
that
no
university
can
be
considered
to
be
doing
its
proper
work
unless
besides
teaching
it
is
also
adding
to
the
existing
body
of
knowledge
by
original
research
because
of
unfortunate
educational
traditions
probably
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
would
enter
into
the
minds
of
most
people
to
conceive
as
likely
to
be
found
in
the
history
of
the
universities
of
the
thirteenth
century
would
be
original
research
in
any
form
in
spite
of
this
almost
universal
false
impression
original
work
of
the
most
valuable
kind
for
much
of
which
workers
would
be
considered
as
amply
deserving
of
their
doctorates
in
the
various
faculties
of
the
departments
of
the
most
of
modern
universities
was
constantly
being
accomplished
during
this
wonderful
century
it
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
this
phase
of
university
activity
that
the
modern
educator
is
sure
to
have
more
sympathy
than
with
any
other
once
the
significant
details
of
the
work
become
clear
all
surprise
that
surpassing
original
work
was
accomplished
will
cease
when
it
is
recalled
that
besides
creating
the
universities
themselves
this
century
gave
us
the
great
cathedrals
a
of
originality
and
a
literature
in
every
civilized
country
of
europe
that
has
been
an
inspiration
to
many
subsequent
generations
at
last
men
had
the
time
to
devote
to
the
things
of
the
mind
during
what
are
called
the
dark
ages
a
term
that
must
ever
be
used
with
the
realization
that
there
are
many
bright
points
of
light
in
them
men
had
been
occupied
with
wars
and
civic
and
political
dissensions
of
all
kinds
and
had
been
gradually
climbing
back
to
the
heights
of
interest
in
intellectual
matters
which
had
been
theirs
before
the
invasion
of
the
barbarians
and
the
migration
of
nations
with
the
rebirth
of
intellectual
interests
there
came
an
intense
curiosity
to
know
everything
and
to
investigate
every
manifestation
everything
that
men
touched
was
novel
and
the
wonderful
advances
they
made
can
only
be
realized
from
actual
consultation
of
their
works
while
the
reader
puts
himself
as
far
as
possible
at
the
same
mental
point
of
view
from
which
they
surveyed
the
world
and
their
relations
to
it
the
modern
university
prides
itself
on
the
number
of
volumes
written
by
its
professors
and
makes
it
a
special
feature
of
its
announcements
to
call
attention
to
its
at
least
supposed
additions
to
knowledge
in
this
mode
it
must
have
been
immensely
more
difficult
to
preserve
the
writings
of
the
professors
of
the
medieval
universities
for
they
had
to
be
copied
out
laboriously
by
hand
yet
we
have
an
enormous
number
of
large
volumes
of
their
works
on
nearly
every
intellectual
topic
that
have
been
carefully
preserved
there
are
some
twenty
closely
printed
large
folio
volumes
of
the
writings
of
albertus
magnus
that
have
come
down
to
us
for
two
centuries
until
the
time
of
printing
ardent
students
must
have
been
satisfied
to
spend
much
time
in
preserving
these
while
mainly
devoted
to
theology
they
treat
of
nearly
everything
else
and
at
least
one
of
the
folio
volumes
is
taken
up
almost
exclusively
with
physical
science
thomas
aquinas
has
as
many
volumes
to
his
credit
and
his
work
is
even
of
more
importance
duns
scotus
died
at
a
very
early
age
scarcely
more
than
forty
yet
his
writings
are
voluminously
extensive
and
have
been
carefully
preserved
for
few
men
had
as
enthusiastic
students
as
he
alas
that
his
name
should
be
preserved
for
most
people
only
in
the
familiar
satiric
appellation
the
modern
educator
will
most
rejoice
at
the
fact
that
the
students
of
the
time
must
have
indeed
been
devoted
to
their
masters
to
set
themselves
to
the
task
of
copying
out
their
work
so
faithfully
for
as
cardinal
newman
has
pointed
out
it
is
the
personal
influence
of
the
master
rather
than
the
greatness
of
the
institution
that
makes
education
effective
first
with
regard
to
philosophy
the
mistress
of
all
studies
whose
throne
has
been
shaken
but
not
shattered
in
these
ultimate
times
after
all
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
this
was
the
great
century
of
the
development
of
scholastic
philosophy
while
this
scholastic
philosophy
is
supposed
by
many
students
of
modern
philosophy
to
be
a
thing
of
the
past
it
still
continues
to
be
the
basis
of
the
philosophical
teaching
in
the
catholic
seminaries
and
universities
throughout
the
world
catholic
philosophers
are
well
known
as
conservative
thinkers
and
writers
and
yet
are
perfectly
free
to
confess
that
they
consider
themselves
the
nearer
to
truth
the
nearer
they
are
to
the
great
scholastic
thinkers
of
the
thirteenth
century
even
in
the
circle
of
students
of
philosophy
who
are
outside
the
influence
of
scholasticism
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
recent
years
an
opinion
much
more
favorable
to
the
schoolmen
has
gradually
arisen
this
has
been
due
to
a
study
of
scholastic
sources
only
those
despise
and
talk
slightingly
of
scholasticism
who
either
do
not
know
it
at
all
or
know
it
only
at
second
hand
with
regard
to
the
system
of
thought
as
such
ever
is
it
true
that
the
more
close
the
acquaintanceship
the
more
respect
there
is
for
it
with
regard
to
theology
the
case
is
even
stronger
than
with
regard
to
philosophy
practically
all
of
the
great
authorities
in
theology
belong
to
the
thirteenth
century
it
is
true
that
men
like
saint
anselm
lived
before
this
time
and
were
leaders
in
the
great
movement
that
culminated
in
our
century
saint
anselm
book
deus
is
indeed
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
combination
of
scholastic
philosophy
and
theology
that
could
well
be
cited
it
is
a
triumph
of
logical
reasoning
applied
to
religious
belief
besides
it
is
a
great
classic
and
any
one
who
can
read
it
unmoved
by
admiration
for
the
thinker
who
so
many
centuries
ago
could
so
trenchantly
lay
down
his
thesis
and
develop
it
must
be
lacking
in
some
of
the
qualities
of
human
admiration
the
writers
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
theology
are
beyond
even
anselm
in
their
marvelous
powers
of
systematizing
thought
one
need
only
mention
such
names
as
albertus
magnus
thomas
aquinas
bonaventure
duns
scotus
and
raymond
lully
to
make
those
who
are
at
all
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
time
realize
that
this
is
not
an
idle
expression
of
the
enthusiasm
of
a
special
votary
of
the
thirteenth
century
as
we
shall
see
in
discussing
the
career
of
saint
thomas
aquinas
the
catholic
church
still
continues
to
teach
scholastic
theology
on
exactly
the
same
lines
as
were
laid
down
by
this
great
doctor
of
the
church
in
his
teaching
at
the
university
of
paris
amid
the
crumbling
of
many
christian
systems
of
thought
as
upheld
by
the
various
protestant
sects
there
has
been
a
very
general
realization
that
the
catholic
church
has
built
up
the
only
edifice
of
christian
apologetics
which
will
stand
the
storms
of
time
and
the
development
of
human
knowledge
confessedly
this
edifice
is
founded
on
thirteenth
century
scholasticism
pope
leo
than
whom
even
in
the
estimation
of
those
who
are
least
sympathetic
toward
his
high
office
there
was
no
man
of
more
supremely
practical
intelligence
in
our
generation
insisted
that
thomas
aquinas
must
in
general
principle
at
least
be
the
groundwork
of
the
teaching
of
philosophy
and
theology
as
they
are
to
form
the
minds
of
future
catholic
apologists
the
scholastic
theology
and
philosophy
of
the
thirteenth
century
have
come
to
us
in
absolute
purity
the
huge
tomes
which
represent
the
indefatigable
labors
of
these
ardent
scholars
were
well
preserved
by
the
subsequent
generation
which
thought
so
much
of
them
and
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
printing
have
come
down
to
us
in
perfectly
clear
texts
it
is
easy
to
neglect
them
and
to
say
that
a
study
of
them
is
not
worth
while
they
represent
however
the
work
and
the
research
in
the
department
of
philosophy
and
theology
of
these
days
and
any
university
of
modern
time
would
consider
itself
honored
by
having
their
authors
among
its
professors
and
alumni
any
one
who
does
not
think
so
need
only
turn
to
the
volumes
themselves
and
read
them
with
understanding
and
sympathy
and
there
will
be
another
convert
to
the
ranks
of
that
growing
multitude
of
scholars
who
have
learned
to
appreciate
the
marvelous
works
of
our
university
colleagues
of
the
thirteenth
century
with
regard
to
law
not
much
need
be
said
here
since
it
is
well
understood
that
the
foundations
of
our
modern
jurisprudence
see
chapters
on
legal
origins
as
well
as
the
methods
of
teaching
law
were
laid
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
the
universities
were
the
most
active
factors
direct
and
indirect
in
this
work
the
university
of
bologna
developed
from
a
law
school
toward
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
irnerius
revived
the
study
of
the
old
roman
law
and
put
the
curriculum
of
modern
civil
law
on
a
firm
basis
a
little
later
gratian
made
his
famous
collection
of
decretals
which
are
the
basis
of
canon

great
popes
during
the
thirteenth
century
beginning
with
innocent
and
continuing
through
such
worthy
emulators
as
gregory
ix
and
boniface
made
it
the
special
glory
of
their
pontificates
to
collect
the
decrees
of
their
predecessors
and
arrange
and
publish
them
so
that
they
might
be
readily
available
for
consultation
french
law
assumed
its
modern
form
and
the
basis
of
french
jurisprudence
was
laid
under
louis
who
called
to
his
assistance
in
this
matter
the
professors
of
law
at
the
university
of
paris
with
many
of
whom
he
was
on
the
most
intimate
terms
his
cousin
ferdinand
of
castile
laid
the
foundation
of
the
spanish
law
about
the
same
time
under
almost
similar
circumstances
and
with
corresponding
help
the
study
of
law
in
the
english
universities
helped
to
the
formulation
of
the
principles
of
the
english
common
law
in
such
simple
connected
form
as
made
them
readily
accessible
for
consultation
just
before
the
beginning
of
the
last
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
bracton
of
whose
work
much
more
will
be
said
in
a
subsequent
chapter
drew
up
the
digest
of
the
english
common
law
which
has
been
the
basis
of
english
jurisprudence
ever
since
it
took
just
about
a
century
for
these
countries
previously
without
proper
codification
of
the
principles
of
their
laws
to
complete
the
fundamental
work
to
such
a
degree
that
it
is
still
the
firm
substructure
on
which
rests
all
our
modern
laws
legal
origins
in
our
modern
sense
came
not
long
before
the
thirteenth
century
at
its
end
the
work
was
finished
to
all
intents
and
purposes
of
the
influence
of
the
universities
and
of
the
university
law
departments
in
all
this
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
incentive
undoubtedly
came
from
their
teachings
the
men
who
did
so
much
for
legal
origins
of
such
importance
were
mainly
students
of
the
universities
of
the
time
whose
enthusiasm
for
work
had
not
subsided
with
the
obtaining
of
their
degrees
it
is
in
medicine
however
much
more
than
in
law
or
theology
that
the
eminently
practical
character
of
university
teaching
during
the
thirteenth
century
can
be
seen
at
least
in
the
form
in
which
it
will
appeal
to
a
scientific
generation
we
are
so
accustomed
to
think
that
anything
like
real
progress
in
medicine
and
especially
in
surgery
has
only
come
in
very
recent
years
that
it
is
a
source
of
great
surprise
to
find
how
much
these
earnest
students
of
a
long
distant
century
anticipated
the
answers
to
problems
the
solutions
of
which
are
usually
supposed
to
be
among
the
most
modern
advances
professor
allbutt
the
regius
professor
of
physic
in
the
university
of
cambridge
a
position
the
occupant
of
which
is
always
a
leader
in
english
medical
thought
the
present
professor
being
one
of
the
world
best
authorities
in
the
history
of
medicine
recently
pointed
out
some
of
these
marvels
of
medicine
and
surgery
in
an
address
on
the
historical
relations
of
medicine
and
surgery
to
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
delivered
at
the
congress
of
arts
and
sciences
at
the
louis
exposition
in
he
allbutt
spoke
with
regard
to
one
of
the
great
university
medical
teachers
of
the
thirteenth
century
as
follows
both
for
his
own
great
merits
as
an
original
and
independent
observer
and
as
the
master
of
lanfranc
william
salicet
guglielmo
salicetti
of
piacenza
in
latin
placentinus
de
saliceto
now
cadeo
was
eminent
among
the
great
italian
physicians
of
the
latter
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
now
these
great
italians
were
as
distinguished
in
surgery
as
in
medicine
and
william
was
one
of
the
protestants
of
the
period
against
the
division
of
surgery
from
inner
medicine
a
division
which
he
regarded
as
a
separation
of
medicine
from
intimate
touch
with
nature
like
lanfranc
and
the
other
great
surgeons
of
the
italian
tradition
and
unlike
franco
and
ambroise
paré
he
had
the
advantage
of
the
liberal
university
education
of
italy
but
like
paré
and
wurtz
he
had
large
practical
experience
in
hospital
and
on
the
battlefield
he
practised
first
at
bologna
afterward
in
verona
william
fully
recognised
that
surgery
can
not
be
learned
from
books
only
his
surgery
contains
many
case
histories
for
he
rightly
opined
that
good
notes
of
cases
are
the
soundest
foundation
of
good
practice
and
in
this
opinion
and
method
lanfranc
followed
him

discovered
that
dropsy
may
be
due

substituted

danger
of

the

disease
of
the

and
he

and

to
their
real
causes
this
paragraph
sets
forth
some
almost
incredible
anticipations
of
what
are
usually
considered
among
the
most
modern
phases
of
medicine
and
surgery
perhaps
the
most
surprising
thing
is
the
simple
statement
that
salicet
recognized
that
surgery
can
not
be
learned
from
books
alone
his
case
histories
are
instructive
even
to
the
modern
surgeon
who
reads
them
his
insistence
on
his
students
making
careful
notes
of
their
cases
as
the
soundest
foundation
of
progress
in
surgery
is
a
direct
contradiction
of
nearly
everything
that
has
been
said
in
recent
years
about
medieval
medicine
and
especially
the
teaching
of
medicine
see
appendix
william
great
pupil
lanfranc
followed
him
in
this
and
lanfranc
encouraged
the
practise
at
the
university
of
paris
there
is
a
of
a
student
at
the
university
of
paris
made
toward
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
carefully
preserved
in
the
museum
of
the
university
of
berlin
this
notebook
was
kept
during
teaching
and
contains
some
sketches
of
dissections
as
well
as
some
illustrations
of
operative
procedures
as
studied
with
that
celebrated
surgeon
the
tradition
of
case
histories
continued
at
the
university
of
paris
down
to
the
beginning
of
modern
surgery
some
of
the
doctrines
in
medicine
that
william
of
salicet
stated
so
clearly
sound
surprisingly
modern
the
connection
for
instance
between
dropsy
and
hardening
of
the
kidneys
shows
how
wonderfully
observant
the
old
master
was
at
the
present
time
we
know
very
little
more
about
the
dropsical
condition
associated
with
chronic
bright
disease
than
the
fact
that
it
constantly
occurs
where
there
is
a
sclerosis
or
contraction
of
the
kidney
bright
in
his
study
of
albuminuria
and
contracted
kidney
practically
taught
us
no
more
than
this
except
that
he
added
the
further
symptom
of
the
presence
of
albumin
in
the
urine
it
must
have
been
only
as
the
result
of
many
carefully
studied
cases
followed
by
autopsies
that
any
such
doctrine
could
have
come
into
existence
there
is
a
dropsy
that
occurs
with
heart
disease
there
is
also
a
dropsy
in
connection
with
certain
affections
of
the
liver
and
yet
the
most
frequent
cause
is
just
this
hardening
of
the
kidneys
spoken
of
by
this
century
italian
professor
of
medicine
who
if
we
would
believe
so
many
of
the
historians
of
medicine
was
not
supposed
to
occupy
himself
at
all
with
ante
and
studies
of
patients
but
with
the
medical
authorities
almost
more
surprising
than
the
question
of
dropsy
is
the
investigation
as
to
the
causes
of
the
failure
of
healing
by
first
intention
the
modern
surgeon
is
very
apt
to
think
that
he
is
the
only
one
who
ever
occupied
himself
with
the
thought
that
wounds
might
be
made
to
heal
by
first
intention
and
without
the
occurrence
of
suppuration
or
granulation
certainly
no
one
would
suspect
any
interest
in
the
matter
as
far
back
as
the
thirteenth
century
william
of
salicet
however
and
lanfranc
both
of
them
occupied
themselves
much
with
this
question
and
evidently
looked
at
it
from
a
very
practical
standpoint
many
careful
observations
must
have
been
made
and
many
sources
of
observational
error
eliminated
to
enable
these
men
to
realize
the
possibilities
of
primary
union
especially
knowing
as
they
did
nothing
at
all
about
the
external
causes
of
suppuration
and
considering
as
did
surgeons
for
nearly
seven
centuries
afterward
that
it
was
because
of
something
within
the
patient
tissues
that
the
cases
of
suppuration
had
their
rise
unfortunately
the
pioneer
work
done
by
william
and
his
great
disciple
did
not
have
that
effect
upon
succeeding
generations
which
it
should
have
had
there
was
a
question
in
men
minds
as
to
whether
nature
worked
better
by
primary
union
or
by
means
of
the
suppurative
process
in
the
next
century
surgeons
took
the
wrong
horn
of
the
dilemma
and
even
so
distinguished
a
surgeon
as
guy
de
chauliac
who
has
been
called
not
without
good
cause
the
father
of
surgery
came
to
the
conclusion
that
suppuration
was
practically
a
necessary
process
in
the
healing
of
large
wounds
at
least
and
that
it
must
be
encouraged
rather
than
discouraged
this
doctrine
did
not
have
its
first
until
the
famous
incident
in
ambroise
paré
career
when
one
morning
after
a
battle
coming
to
his
patients
expecting
to
find
many
of
them
very
severely
ill
he
found
them
on
the
contrary
in
better
condition
than
the
others
for
whom
he
had
no
forebodings
in
accord
with
old
custom
he
poured
boiling
oil
into
the
wounds
of
all
patients
but
the
great
surgeon
supply
of
oil
had
failed
the
day
before
and
he
used
plain
water
to
cleanse
the
wounds
of
a
number
fearing
the
worst
for
them
however
because
of
the
poison
that
must
necessarily
stay
in
their
wounds
and
then
had
the
agreeable
disappointment
of
finding
these
patients
in
much
better
condition
than
those
whom
he
had
treated
with
all
the
rules
of
his
art
as
they
then
were
even
this
incident
however
did
not
serve
to
correct
entirely
the
old
idea
as
to
the
value
of
suppuration
and
down
to
lister
time
that
is
almost
the
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
there
is
still
question
of
the
value
of
suppuration
in
expediting
the
healing
of
wounds
and
we
hear
of
laudable
pus
and
of
the
proper
inflammatory
reaction
that
is
expected
to
bring
about
wound
repair
the
danger
of
wounds
of
the
neck
is
of
course
not
a
modern
doctrine
and
yet
very
few
people
would
think
for
a
moment
that
it
could
be
traced
back
to
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
to
a
practical
teacher
of
surgery
in
a
medieval
italian
university
here
once
more
there
is
evidence
of
the
work
of
a
careful
observer
who
has
seen
patients
expire
in
a
few
minutes
as
the
result
of
some
serious
incident
during
the
course
of
operations
upon
the
neck
he
did
not
realize
that
the
danger
was
due
in
many
cases
to
the
sucking
in
of
air
into
the
large
veins
but
even
at
the
present
time
this
question
is
not
wholly
settled
and
the
problem
as
to
the
danger
of
the
presence
of
air
is
still
the
subject
of
investigation
as
to
the
suture
of
divided
nerves
it
would
ordinarily
and
as
a
matter
of
course
be
claimed
by
most
modern
historians
of
surgery
and
by
practically
all
surgeons
as
an
affair
entirely
of
the
last
half
century
william
of
salicet
however
neglected
none
of
the
ordinary
surgical
procedures
that
could
be
undertaken
under
the
discouraging
surgical
circumstances
in
which
he
lived
the
limitations
of
anesthesia
though
there
was
much
more
of
this
aid
than
there
has
commonly
been
any
idea
of
and
the
frequent
occurrence
of
suppuration
must
have
been
constant
sources
of
disheartenment
his
insistence
on
the
use
of
the
knife
rather
than
on
the
cautery
shows
how
much
he
appreciated
the
value
of
proper
healing
it
is
from
such
a
man
that
we
might
expect
the
advance
by
careful
investigation
as
to
just
what
tissues
had
been
injured
with
the
idea
of
bringing
them
together
in
such
juxtaposition
as
would
prevent
loss
of
function
and
encourage
rapid
and
perfect
union

perhaps
to
the
ordinary
individual
william
reference
of
certain
known
venereal
affections
to
their
proper
cause
will
be
the
most
astonishing
in
this
marvelous
list
of
anticipations
of
what
is
supposed
to
be
very
modern
the
whole
subject
of
venereal
disease
in
anything
like
a
scientific
treatment
of
it
is
supposed
to
date
from
the
early
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
there
is
even
question
in
certain
minds
as
to
whether
the
venereal
diseases
did
not
come
into
existence
or
at
least
were
not
introduced
from
america
or
from
some
other
distant
country
that
the
europeans
had
been
exploring
about
this
time
william
studies
in
this
subject
however
serve
to
show
that
nothing
escaped
his
watchful
eye
and
that
he
was
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
a
careful
observer
and
must
have
been
an
eminently
suggestive
and
helpful
teacher
what
has
thus
been
learned
about
him
will
serve
of
itself
and
without
more
ado
to
stamp
all
that
has
been
said
about
the
unpractical
character
of
the
medical
teaching
of
the
medieval
universities
as
utterly
unfounded
because
men
have
not
taken
the
trouble
to
look
up
the
teaching
of
these
times
and
because
their
works
were
until
recent
years
buried
in
old
folios
difficult
to
obtain
and
still
more
difficult
to
read
when
obtained
it
has
been
easy
to
ignore
their
merit
and
even
to
impugn
the
value
of
their
teaching
completely
william
of
salicet
was
destined
moreover
to
be
surpassed
in
some
ways
by
his
most
distinguished
pupil
lanfranc
who
taught
at
the
university
of
paris
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
of
lanfranc
in
the
address
already
quoted
from
professor
allbutt
has
one
very
striking
paragraph
that
shows
how
progressive
was
the
work
of
this
great
french
surgeon
and
how
fruitful
had
been
the
suggestive
teaching
of
his
great
master
he
says
lanfranc
magna
was
a
great
work
written
by
a
reverent
but
independent
follower
of
salicet
he
distinguished
between
venous
and
arterial
hemorrhage
and
used
styptics

aloes
and
white

egg
was
a
popular
styptic

hour

his
chapter
on
injuries
of
the
head
is
one
of
the
classics
of
medieval
surgery
clerk
cleric
as
he
was
lanfranc
nevertheless
saw
but
the
more
clearly
the
danger
of
separating
surgery
from
medicine
certain
assertions
in
this
paragraph
deserve
as
in
the
case
of
lanfranc
master
to
be
discussed
because
of
their
anticipations
of
what
is
sometimes
thought
to
be
very
modern
in
surgery
the
older
surgeons
are
supposed
to
have
feared
hemorrhage
very
much
it
is
often
asserted
that
they
knew
little
or
nothing
about
the
ligature
and
that
their
control
of
hemorrhage
was
very
inadequate
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
it
was
not
primary
hemorrhage
that
the
old
surgeons
feared
but
secondary
hemorrhage
suppuration
often
led
to
the
opening
of
an
important
artery
and
this
accident
as
can
well
be
understood
was
very
much
dreaded
surgeons
would
lose
their
patients
before
they
could
come
to
their
relief
how
thoroughly
lanfranc
knew
how
to
control
primary
hemorrhage
can
be
appreciated
from
the
quotation
just
made
from
allbutt
address
the
ligature
is
sometimes
said
to
have
been
an
invention
of
ambroise
paré
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
had
been
in
use
for
at
least
three
centuries
before
his
time
and
perhaps
even
longer
usually
it
is
considered
that
the
difficult
chapter
of
head
injuries
with
all
the
problems
that
it
involves
in
diagnosis
and
treatment
is
a
product
of
the
nineteenth
century
hence
do
we
read
with
all
the
more
interest
allbutt
declaration
that
lanfranc
wrote
what
is
practically
a
classical
monograph
on
the
subject
it
is
not
so
surprising
then
to
find
that
the
great
french
surgeon
was
far
ahead
of
his
generation
in
other
matters
or
that
he
should
even
have
realized
the
danger
of
separating
surgery
from
medicine
both
the
regius
professors
of
medicine
at
the
two
great
english
universities
cambridge
and
oxford
have
since
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
made
public
expression
of
their
opinion
that
the
physician
should
see
more
of
the
work
of
the
surgeon
and
should
not
depend
on
the
autopsy
room
for
his
knowledge
of
the
results
of
internal
disease
professor
osler
particularly
has
emphasized
his
colleague
professor
allbutt
opinion
in
this
matter
that
a
surgical
professor
at
the
university
of
paris
in
the
thirteenth
century
should
have
anticipated
these
two
leaders
of
medical
thought
in
the
twentieth
century
would
not
be
so
surprising
only
that
unfortunately
the
history
of
medieval
teaching
has
because
of
prejudice
and
a
lamentable
tradition
not
been
read
aright
occasionally
one
finds
a
startling
bit
of
anticipation
of
what
is
most
modern
in
medicine
as
well
as
in
surgery
for
instance
toward
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
distinguished
english
professor
of
medicine
known
as
gilbert
the
englishman
was
teaching
at
montpelier
and
among
other
things
was
insisting
that
the
rooms
of
patients
suffering
from
smallpox
should
be
hung
entirely
with
red
curtains
and
that
the
doors
and
the
windows
should
be
covered
with
heavy
red
hangings
he
claimed
that
this
made
the
disease
run
a
lighter
course
with
lessened
mortality
and
with
very
much
less
disfigurement
smallpox
was
an
extremely
common
disease
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
he
probably
had
many
chances
for
observation
it
is
interesting
to
realize
that
one
of
the
most
important
observations
made
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
finsen
the
danish
investigator
whose
studies
in
light
and
its
employment
in
therapeutics
drew
to
him
the
attention
of
the
world
and
eventually
the
nobel
prize
of
for
the
greatest
advance
in
medicine
was
that
the
admission
of
only
red
light
to
the
room
of
smallpox
patients
modified
the
disease
very
materially
shortened
its
course
often
prevented
the
secondary
fever
and
almost
did
away
completely
with
the
subsequent
disfigurement
it
is
evident
that
these
men
were
searching
and
investigating
for
themselves
and
not
following
blindly
in
the
footsteps
of
any
master
it
has
often
been
said
that
during
the
middle
ages
it
was
a
heresy
to
depart
ever
so
little
from
the
teaching
of
galen
usually
it
is
customary
to
add
that
the
first
writer
to
break
away
from
galen
effectually
was
vesalius
in
his
de
fabrica
corporis
humani
published
toward
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
may
be
said
in
passing
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
vesalius
though
he
accomplished
much
by
original
investigation
did
not
break
so
effectually
with
galen
as
would
have
been
for
the
best
in
his
own
work
and
especially
for
its
influence
on
his
successors
he
certainly
did
not
set
an
example
of
independent
research
and
personal
observation
any
more
fully
than
did
the
medical
teachers
of
the
thirteenth
century
already
mentioned
and
some
others
like
mondaville
and
arnold
of
villanova
whose
names
well
deserve
to
be
associated
with
them
one
reason
why
it
is
such
a
surprise
to
find
how
thoroughly
practical
was
the
teaching
of
the
thirteenth
century
university
medical
schools
is
because
it
has
somehow
come
to
be
a
very
general
impression
that
medicine
was
taught
mainly
by
disputations
and
by
the
consultation
of
authorities
and
that
it
was
always
more
important
to
have
a
passage
of
galen
to
support
a
medical
notion
than
to
have
an
original
observation
this
false
impression
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
writers
of
the
history
of
medical
education
have
until
recent
years
drawn
largely
on
their
imaginations
and
have
not
consulted
the
medical
books
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
printing
was
not
discovered
for
more
than
two
centuries
later
there
are
many
treatises
on
medicine
that
have
come
down
to
us
from
this
early
time
and
the
historians
of
medicine
now
have
the
opportunity
and
are
taking
the
trouble
to
read
them
with
a
consequent
alteration
of
views
as
to
the
lack
of
encouragement
for
original
observation
in
the
later
middle
ages
these
old
tomes
are
not
easy
reading
but
nothing
daunts
a
german
investigator
bound
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
his
subject
and
such
men
as
pagel
and
puschmann
have
done
much
to
rediscover
for
us
medieval
medicine
the
french
medical
historians
have
not
been
behind
their
german
colleagues
and
magnificent
work
has
been
accomplished
especially
by
the
republication
of
old
texts
william
of
surgery
was
republished
by
pifteau
at
toulouse
in
surgery
was
republished
under
the
auspices
of
the
society
for
the
publication
of
old
french
texts
in
and
these
republications
have
made
the
works
of
the
surgeons
readily
available
for
study
by
all
interested
in
our
great
predecessors
in
medicine
all
over
the
world
before
this
it
has
always
been
necessary
to
get
to
some
of
the
libraries
in
which
the
old
texts
were
preserved
and
this
of
course
made
it
extremely
difficult
for
the
ordinary
teacher
of
the
history
of
medicine
to
know
anything
about
them
besides
old
texts
are
such
difficult
reading
that
few
except
the
most
earnest
of
students
have
patience
for
them
and
they
are
so
as
to
be
practically
impossible
for
modern
hurried
students
unfortunately
writers
of
the
history
of
medicine
filled
up
this
gap
in
their
knowledge
only
too
frequently
either
out
of
their
imaginations
or
out
of
their
inadequate
authorities
with
the
consequence
of
inveterating
the
false
impression
with
regard
to
the
absence
of
anything
of
medical
or
surgical
interest
even
in
the
later
middle
ages
another
and
much
more
serious
reason
for
the
false
impression
with
regard
to
the
supposed
blankness
of
the
middle
age
in
medical
progress
was
the
notion
quite
generally
accepted
and
even
yet
not
entirely
rejected
by
many
that
the
church
was
opposed
to
scientific
advance
in
the
centuries
before
the
reformation
and
that
even
the
sciences
allied
to
medicine
fell
under
her
ban
for
instance
there
is
not
a
history
of
medicine
so
far
as
i
know
published
in
the
english
language
which
does
not
assert
that
pope
boniface
by
a
bull
promulgated
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
forbade
the
practise
of
dissection
to
most
people
it
will
at
once
seem
a
natural
conclusion
that
if
the
feeling
against
the
study
of
the
human
body
by
dissection
had
reached
such
a
pass
as
to
call
forth
a
papal
decree
in
the
matter
at
the
end
of
the
century
all
during
the
previous
hundred
years
there
must
have
been
enough
ecclesiastical
hampering
of
anatomical
work
to
prevent
anything
like
true
progress
and
to
preclude
the
idea
of
any
genuinely
progressive
teaching
of
anatomy
there
is
not
the
slightest
basis
for
this
bit
of
false
history
except
an
unfortunate
it
is
to
be
hoped
not
intentional
misapprehension
on
the
part
of
historical
writers
as
to
the
meaning
of
a
papal
decree
issued
by
boniface
viii
in
the
year
he
forbade
under
pain
of
excommunication
the
boiling
of
bodies
and
their
dismemberment
in
order
that
thus
piecemeal
they
might
be
transported
to
long
distances
for
burial
purposes
it
is
now
well
known
that
the
bull
was
aimed
at
certain
practises
which
had
crept
in
especially
among
the
crusaders
in
the
east
when
a
member
of
the
nobility
fell
a
victim
to
wounds
or
to
disease
his
companions
not
infrequently
dismembered
the
body
boiled
it
so
as
to
prevent
putrefaction
or
at
least
delay
decay
and
then
transported
it
long
distances
to
his
home
in
order
that
he
might
have
christian
burial
in
some
favorite
graveyard
and
that
his
friends
might
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
where
his
remains
rested
the
body
of
the
emperor
frederick
barbarosa
who
died
in
the
east
is
said
to
have
been
thus
treated
boniface
was
one
of
the
most
broadly
educated
men
of
his
time
who
had
been
a
great
professor
of
canon
and
civil
law
at
paris
when
younger
and
realized
the
dangers
involved
in
such
a
proceeding
from
a
sanitary
standpoint
and
he
forbade
it
requiring
that
the
bodies
should
be
buried
where
the
persons
had
died
he
evidently
considered
that
the
ancient
custom
of
consecrating
a
portion
of
earth
for
the
purpose
of
burial
in
order
that
the
full
christian
rites
might
be
performed
was
quite
sufficient
for
noble
as
for
common
soldier
for
this
very
commendable
sanitary
regulation
boniface
has
been
set
down
by
historians
of
medicine
as
striking
a
death
blow
at
the
development
of
anatomy
for
the
next
two
centuries
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
anatomy
continued
to
be
studied
in
the
universities
after
this
bull
as
it
had
been
before
and
it
is
evident
that
never
by
any
misapprehension
as
to
its
meaning
was
the
practise
of
dissection
lessened
curiously
enough
the
history
of
human
dissection
can
only
be
traced
with
absolute
certainty
from
the
time
immediately
after
this
bull
it
is
during
the
next
years
at
the
university
of
bologna
which
was
always
closely
in
touch
with
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
in
italy
and
especially
with
the
pope
that
the
foundations
of
dissection
as
the
most
important
practical
department
of
medical
teaching
were
laid
by
mondino
whose
book
on
dissection
continued
to
be
the
text
book
used
in
most
of
the
medical
schools
for
the
next
two
centuries
guy
de
chauliac
who
studied
there
during
the
first
half
of
the
fourteenth
century
says
he
saw
many
dissections
made
there
it
was
at
montpellier
about
the
middle
of
the
century
when
the
popes
were
at
avignon
not
far
away
that
guy
de
chauliac
himself
made
attendance
at
dissections
obligatory
for
every
student
and
obtained
permission
to
use
the
bodies
of
criminals
for
dissection
purposes
at
the
time
chauliac
occupied
the
post
of
chamberlain
to
the
popes
all
during
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
constant
progress
was
making
in
anatomy
especially
in
italy
and
some
of
it
was
accomplished
at
rome
by
distinguished
teachers
of
anatomy
who
had
been
summoned
by
the
popes
to
their
capital
in
order
to
add
distinction
to
the
teaching
staff
at
the
famous
papal
school
of
science
the
sapienza
to
which
were
attached
during
the
next
two
centuries
many
of
the
distinguished
scientific
professors
of
the
time
this
story
with
regard
to
the
papal
prohibition
of
dissection
has
no
foundation
in
the
history
of
the
times
it
has
had
not
a
little
to
do
however
with
making
these
times
very
much
misunderstood
and
one
still
continues
to
see
printed
references
to
the
misfortune
which
is
more
usually
called
a
crime
that
prevented
the
development
of
a
great
humanitarian
science
because
of
ecclesiastical
prejudice
this
story
with
regard
to
anatomy
however
is
not
a
whit
worse
than
that
which
is
told
of
chemistry
in
almost
the
same
terms
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
pope
john
xxii
is
said
to
have
issued
a
bull
forbidding
chemistry
under
pain
of
excommunication
which
according
to
some
writers
in
the
matter
is
said
to
have
included
the
death
penalty
it
has
been
felt
in
the
same
way
as
with
regard
to
anatomy
that
this
was
only
the
culmination
of
a
feeling
in
ecclesiastical
circles
against
chemistry
which
must
have
hampered
its
progress
all
during
the
thirteenth
century
an
examination
of
the
bull
with
regard
to
chemistry
it
is
really
only
a
decree
shows
even
less
reason
for
the
slander
of
pope
john
xxii
than
of
boniface
viii
john
had
been
scarcely
a
year
on
the
papal
throne
when
he
issued
this
decree
forbidding
alchemies
and
inflicting
a
punishment
upon
those
who
practised
them
the
first
sentence
of
the
title
of
the
document
is
alchemies
are
here
prohibited
and
those
who
practise
them
or
procure
their
being
done
are
punished
this
is
evidently
all
of
the
decree
that
those
who
quoted
it
as
a
prohibition
of
chemistry
seem
ever
to
have
read
under
the
name
alchemies
pope
john
as
is
clear
from
the
rest
of
the
document
meant
a
particular
kind
of
chemical
manipulations
he
forbade
the
supposed
manufacture
of
gold
and
silver
the
first
sentence
of
his
decree
shows
how
thoroughly
he
recognized
the
falsity
of
the
pretensions
of
the
alchemists
in
this
matter
poor
themselves
he
says
the
alchemists
promise
riches
which
are
not
forthcoming
he
then
forbids
them
further
to
impose
upon
the
poor
people
whose
confidence
they
abuse
and
whose
good
money
they
take
to
return
them
only
or
none
at
all
the
only
punishment
inflicted
for
the
doing
of
these
alchemies
on
those
who
might
transgress
the
decree
was
not
death
or
imprisonment
but
that
the
pretended
makers
of
gold
and
silver
should
be
required
to
turn
into
the
public
treasury
as
much
gold
and
silver
as
had
been
paid
them
for
their
alchemies
the
money
thus
paid
in
to
go
to
the
poor
as
in
the
case
of
the
bull
with
regard
to
anatomy
it
is
very
clear
that
by
no
possible
misunderstanding
at
the
time
was
the
development
of
the
science
of
chemistry
hindered
by
this
papal
document
chemistry
had
to
a
certain
extent
been
cultivated
at
the
university
of
paris
mainly
by
ecclesiastics
both
aquinas
and
his
master
albertus
wrote
treatises
on
chemical
subjects
roger
bacon
devoted
much
time
to
it
as
is
well
known
and
for
the
next
three
centuries
the
history
of
chemistry
has
a
number
of
names
of
men
who
were
not
only
unhampered
by
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
but
who
were
themselves
usually
either
ecclesiastics
or
high
in
favor
with
the
churchmen
of
their
time
and
place
this
is
true
of
hollandus
of
arnold
of
villanova
of
basil
valentine
and
finally
of
the
many
abbots
and
bishops
to
whom
paracelsus
in
his
time
acknowledged
his
obligations
for
aid
in
his
chemical
studies
almost
needless
to
say
it
has
been
impossible
in
a
brief
sketch
of
this
kind
limited
to
a
single
chapter
to
give
anything
like
an
adequate
idea
of
what
the
enthusiastic
graduate
students
and
professors
of
the
thirteenth
century
succeeded
in
accomplishing
it
is
probably
this
department
of
university
life
however
that
has
been
least
understood
or
rather
we
should
say
most
persistently
misunderstood
the
education
of
the
time
is
usually
supposed
to
be
eminently
unpractical
and
great
advances
in
the
departments
of
knowledge
that
had
important
bearings
on
human
life
and
its
relations
were
not
therefore
thought
possible
it
is
just
here
however
that
sympathetic
interpretation
and
the
pointing
out
of
the
coordination
of
intellectual
work
often
considered
to
be
quite
distinct
from
university
influences
were
needed
it
is
hoped
then
that
this
short
sketch
will
prove
sufficient
to
call
the
attention
of
modern
educators
to
a
field
that
has
been
neglected
or
at
least
has
received
very
little
cultivation
compared
to
its
importance
but
which
must
be
sedulously
worked
if
our
generation
is
to
understand
with
any
degree
of
thoroughness
the
spirit
manifested

beyond
all

the
most
significant
chapter
in
the
book

its
arts
is
to
be
found
in
the
great
gothic
cathedrals
so
many
of
which
were
erected
at
this
time
and
whose
greatest
perfection
of
finish
in
design
and
in
detail
came
just
at
the
beginning
of
this
wonderful
period
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
gradual
development
of
gothic
out
of
the
older
romanesque
architectural
forms
nor
with
the
oriental
elements
that
may
have
helped
this
great
evolution
all
that
especially
concerns
us
is
the
fact
that
the
generations
of
the
thirteenth
century
took
the
gothic
ideas
in
architecture
and
applied
them
so
marvelously
that
thereafter
it
could
be
felt
that
no
problem
of
structural
work
had
been
left
unsolved
and
no
feature
of
ornament
or
decoration
left
untried
or
at
least
unsuggested
the
great
center
of
gothic
influence
was
the
north
of
france
but
it
spread
from
here
to
every
country
in
europe
and
owing
to
the
intimate
relations
existing
between
england
and
france
because
of
the
presence
of
the
normans

both
countries

as
rapidly

with
as
much
beauty

in

country
it
is
in

in
england
just
before
the
thirteenth
century
that
the
spirit
which
gave
rise
to
the
cathedrals
can
be
best
observed
at
work
and
its
purposes
most
thoroughly
appreciated
the
great
cathedral
at
lincoln
had
some
of
its
most
important
features
before
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
this
was
doubtless
due
to
the
famous
hugh
of
lincoln
who
was
a
frenchman
by
birth
and
whose
experience
in
normandy
in
early
life
enabled
him
successfully
to
set
about
the
creation
of
a
gothic
cathedral

the

had

lincoln
hugh
himself
was

deeply
interested

to
make
every
sacrifice
for
them
even
to
the
extent
of
incurring
the
enmity
of
his
king

froude
usually
so
unsympathetic
to
medieval
men
and
things
has
included
him
among
his
short
studies
of
great
subjects
that
one
can
not
help
but
think
that
when
he
devoted
himself
to
the
erection
of
the
magnificent
cathedral
he
realized
very
well
that
it
would
become
a
center
of
influence
not
only
religious
but
eminently
educational
in
its
effects
upon
the
people
of
his
diocese
the
work
was
begun
then
with
a
consciousness
of
the
results
to
be
attained
and
the
influence
of
the
cathedral
must
not
be
looked
upon
as
accidental
he
must
have
appreciated
that
the
creating
of
a
work

beauty
in
which
the
people
themselves
shared

they
looked
on
as
their
own
property
to
which
they
came

every
second
day

the
year

religious
services
would
be
a
telling
book
out
of
which
they
would
receive
more
education
than
could
come
to
them
in
any
other
way
of
course
we
can
not
hope
in
a
short
chapter
or
two
to
convey
any
adequate
impression
of
the
work
that
was
done
in

history

dodd

the
subject
of
the
cathedrals
their
architecture
and
decoration
is
in
fact
practicably
inexhaustible
priests
and
laymen
worked
with
masons
painters
and
sculptors
and
all
were
bent
on
producing
the
best
possible
building
and
improving
every
part
and
every
detail
till
the
amount
of
thought
and
contrivance
accumulated
in
any
single
structure
is
almost
incomprehensible
if
any
one
man
were
to
devote
a
lifetime
to
the
study
of
one
of
our
great
cathedrals
assuming
it
to
be
complete
in
all
its
medieval
arrangements
it
is
questionable
whether
he
would
master
all
its
details
and
fathom
all
the
reasonings
and
experiments
which
led
to
the
glorious
result
before
him
and
when
we
consider
that
not
in
the
great
cities
alone
but
in
every
convent
and
in
every
parish
thoughtful
professional
men
were
trying
to
excel
what
had
been
done
and
was
doing
by
their
predecessors
and
their
fellows
we
shall
understand
what
an
amount
of
thought
is
built
into
the
walls
of
our
churches
castles
colleges
and
dwelling
houses
if
any
one
thinks
he
can
master
and
reproduce
all
this
he
can
hardly
fail
to
be
mistaken
my
own
impression
is
that
not
one
tenth
part
of
it
has
been
reproduced
in
all
the
works
written
on
the
subject
up
to
this
day
and
much
of
it
is
probably
lost
and
never
again
to
be
recovered
for
the
instruction
and
delight
of
future
ages
this
profound
significance
and
charming
quality
of
the
cathedrals
is
usually
unrecognized
by
those
who
see
them
only
once
or
twice
and
who
though
they
are
very
much
interested
in
them
for
the
moment
have
no
idea
of
the
wealth
of
artistic
suggestion
and
of
thoughtful
design
so
solicitously
yet
happily
put
into
them
by
their
builders
people
who
have
seen
them
many
times
however
who
have
lived
in
close
touch
with
them
who
have
been
away
from
them
for
a
time
and
have
come
back
to
them
find
the
wondrous
charm
that
is
in
these
buildings
architects
and
workmen
put
their
very
souls
into
them
and
they
will
always
be
of
interest
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
casual
visitor
at
all
times
and
in
all
moods
finds
them
ever
a
source
of
constantly
renewed
pleasure
no
matter
how
many
times
they
may
be
seen
elizabeth
robbins
pennell
has
expressed
this
power
of
cathedrals
to
please
at
all
times
even
after
they
have
been
often
seen
and
are
very
well
known
in
a
recent
number
of
the
in
describing
the
great
cathedral
of
notre
dame
often
as
i
have
seen
notre
dame
she
says
the
marvel
of
it
never
grows
less
i
go
to
paris
with
no
thought
of
time
for
it
busy
about
many
other
things
and
then
on
my
way
over
one
of
the
bridges
across
the
river
perhaps
i
see
it
again
on
its
island
the
beautiful
towers
high
above
the
houses
and
palaces
and
the
view
now
so
familiar
strikes
me
afresh
with
all
the
wonder
of
my
first
impression
this
is
we
think
the
experience
of
everyone
who
has
the
opportunity
to
see
much
of
notre
dame
the
present
writer
during
the
course
of
his
medical
studies
spent
many
months
in
daily
view
of
the
cathedral
and
did
a
good
deal
of
work
at
the
old
morgue
situated
behind
the
cathedral
even
at
the
end
of
his
stay
he
was
constantly
finding
new
beauties
in
the
grand
old
structure
and
learning
to
appreciate
it
more
and
more
as
the
changing
seasons
of
a
paris
fall
and
winter
and
spring
threw
varying
lights
and
shadows
over
it
it
was
like
a
work
of
nature
never
growing
old
but
constantly
displaying
some
new
phase
of
beauty
to
the
pennell
resents
only
the
restorations
that
have
been
made
generations
down
even
to
our
time
have
considered
that
they
could
rebuild
as
beautifully
as
the
thirteenth
century
constructors
some
of
them
even
have
thought
that
they
could
do
better
doubtless
yet
their
work
has
in
the
opinion
of
good
critics
served
only
to
spoil
or
at
least
to
detract
from
the
finer
beauty
of
the
original
plan
no
wonder
that
stevenson
who
knew
and
loved
the
old
cathedral
so
well
said
notre
dame
is
the
only
thing
that
unites
majesty
elegance
and
awfulness
inasmuch
as
it
does
so
it
is
a
typical
product
of
this
wonderful
thirteenth
century
the
only
serious
rival
the
greeks
have
ever
had
but
of
course
it
does
not
stand
alone
there
are
other
cathedrals
built
at
the
same
time
at
least
as
handsome
and
as
full
of
suggestions
indeed
in
the
opinion
of
many
critics
it
is
inferior
in
certain
respects
to
some
three
or
four
of
the
greatest
gothic
cathedrals
it
can
not
be
possible
that
these
generations
builded
so
much
better
than
they
knew
that
it
is
only
by
a
sort
of
happy
accident
that
their
edifices
still
continue
to
be
the
subject
of
such
profound
admiration
and
such
endless
sources
of
pleasure
after
seven
centuries
of
experience
if
so
we
would
certainly
be
glad
to
have
some
such
happy
accident
occur
in
our
generation
for
we
are
building
nothing
at
the
present
time
with
regard
to
which
we
have
any
such
high
hopes
of
course
the
generations
of
cathedral
builders
knew
and
appreciated
their
own
work
the
triumph
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
therefore
all
the
more
marked
and
must
be
considered
as
directly
due
to
the
environment
and
the
education
of
its
people
we
have
then
in
the
study
of
their
cathedrals
the
keynote
for
the
modern
appreciation
of
the
character
and
the
development
of
their
builders
it
will
be
readily
understood
how
inevitably
fragmentary
must
be
our
consideration
of
the
cathedrals
yet
there
is
the
consolation
that
they
are
the
best
known
feature
of
thirteenth
century
achievement
and
that
consequently
all
that
will
be
necessary
will
be
to
point
out
the
significance
of
their
construction
as
the
basis
of
the
great
movement
of
education
and
uplift
in
the
century
perhaps
first
a
word
is
needed
with
regard
to
the
varieties
of
gothic
in
the
different
countries
of
europe
and
what
they
meant
in
the
period
probably
the
most
interesting
feature
of
the
history
of
gothic
architecture
at
this
period
is
to
be
found
in
the
circumstance
that
while
all
of
the
countries
erected
gothic
structures
along
the
general
lines
which
had
been
laid
down
by
its
great
inventors
in
the
north
and
center
of
france
none
of
the
architects
and
builders
of
the
century
in
other
countries
slavishly
followed
the
french
models
english
gothic
is
quite
distinct
from
its
french
ancestor
and
while
it
has
defects
it
has
beauties
that
are
all
its
own
and
a
simplicity
and
grandeur
well
suited
to
the
more
rugged
character
of
the
people
among
whom
it
developed
italian
gothic
has
less
merits
perhaps
than
any
of
the
other
forms
of
the
art
that
developed
in
the
different
nations
in
italy
with
its
bright
sunlight
there
was
less
crying
need
for
the
window
space
for
the
provision
of
which
in
the
darker
northern
countries
gothic
was
invented
but
even
here
the
possibilities
of
decorated
architecture
along
certain
lines
were
exhausted
more
fully
than
anywhere
else
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
esthetic
spirit
of
the
italians
german
gothic
has
less
refinement
than
any
of
the
other
national
forms
yet
it
is
not
lacking
in
a
certain
straightforward
strength
and
simplicity
of
appearance
which
recommends
it
the
germans
often
violated
the
french
canons
of
architecture
yet
did
not
spoil
the
ultimate
effect
stephen
in
vienna
has
many
defects
yet
as
a
good
architectural
authority
has
declared
it
is
the
work
of
a
poet
and
looks
it
a
recent
paragraph
with
regard
to
spanish
gothic
in
an
article
on
spain
by
havelock
ellis
illustrates
the
national
qualities
of
this
style
very
well
as
much
less
is
generally
known
about
the
special
development
of
gothic
architecture
in
the
spanish
peninsula
it
has
seemed
worth
while
to
quote
it
at
some
length
moreover
there
is
no
type
of
architecture
which
so
admirably
embodies
the
romantic
spirit
as
spanish
gothic
such
a
statement
implies
no
heresy
against
the
supremacy
of
french
gothic
but
the
very
qualities
of
harmony
and
balance
of
finely
tempered
reason
which
make
french
gothic
so
exquisitely
satisfying
softened
the
combination
of
mysteriously
grandiose
splendor
with
detailed
realism
in
which
lies
the
essence
of
gothic
as
the
manifestation
of
the
romantic
spirit
spanish
gothic
at
once
by
its
massiveness
and
extravagance
and
by
its
realistic
naturalness
far
more
potently
embodies
the
spirit
of
medieval
life
it
is
less
esthetically
beautiful
but
it
is
more
romantic
in
leon
cathedral
spain
possesses
one
of
the
very
noblest
and
purest
examples
of
french
gothic
a
church
which
may
almost
be
said
to
be
the
supreme
type
of
the
gothic
ideal
of
a
delicate
house
of
glass
finely
poised
between
buttresses
but
there
is
nothing
spanish
about
it
for
the
typical
gothic
of
spain
we
must
go
to
toledo
and
burgos
to
tarragona
and
barcelona
here
we
find
the
elements
of
stupendous
size
of
mysterious
gloom
of
grotesque
and
yet
realistic
energy
which
are
the
dominant
characters
alike
of
spanish
architecture
and
of
medieval
romance
those
who
think
that
the
gothic
architecture
came
to
a
perfection
all
its
own
by
a
sort
of
wonderful
manifestation
of
genius
in
a
single
generation
and
then
stayed
there
are
sadly
mistaken
there
was
a
constant
development
to
be
noted
all
during
the
thirteenth
century
this
development
was
always
in
the
line
of
true
improvement
while
just
after
the
century
closed
degeneration
began
decoration
became
too
important
a
consideration
parts
were
with
ornament
and
the
decadence
of
taste
in
gothic
architecture
can
not
escape
the
eye
even
of
the
most
untutored
all
during
the
thirteenth
century
the
tendency
was
always
to
greater
lightness
and
elegance
one
is
apt
to
think
of
these
immense
structures
as
manifestations
of
the
power
of
man
to
overcome
great
engineering
difficulties
and
to
solve
immense
structural
problems
rather
than
as
representing
opportunities
for
the
expression
of
what
was
most
beautiful
and
poetic
in
the
intellectual
aspirations
of
the
generations
but
this
is
what
they
were
and
their
architects
were
poets
for
in
the
best
sense
of
the
etymology
of
the
word
they
were
creators
that
their
raw
material
was
stone
and
mortar
rather
than
words
was
only
an
accident
of
their
environment
each
of
the
architects
succeeded
in
expressing
himself
with
wonderful
individuality
in
his
own
work
in
each
cathedral
the
improvements
introduced
by
the
thirteenth
century
people
into
the
architecture
that
came
to
them
were
all
of
a
very
practical
kind
and
were
never
suggested
for
the
sake
of
merely
adding
to
opportunities
for
ornamentation
in
this
matter
skillful
combinations
of
line
and
form
were
thought
out
and
executed
with
wonderful
success
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
delicate
shafts
of
marble
highly
polished
were
employed
rather
freely
but
as
these
seldom
carried
weight
and
were
mainly
ornamental
in
character
they
were
gradually
eliminated
yet
without
sacrificing
any
of
the
beauty
of
structure
since
combinations
of
light
and
shade
were
secured
by
the
composition
of
various
forms
and
the
use
of
delicately
rounded
mouldings
alternated
with
hollows
so
as
to
produce
forcible
effects
in
high
light
and
deep
shadow
in
a
word
these
architects
and
builders
of
the
thirteenth
century
set
themselves
the
problem
of
building
effectively
making
every
portion
count
in
the
building
itself
and
yet
securing
ornamental
effects
out
of
actual
structure
such
as
no
other
set
of
architects
have
ever
been
able
to
surpass
and
probably
only
the
greek
architects
of
the
periclean
period
ever
equaled
needless
to
say
this
is
the
very
acme
of
success
in
architectural
work
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
generations
of
the
after
time
have
all
gone
back
so
lovingly
to
study
the
work
of
this
period
it
might
be
thought
that
while
gothic
architecture
was
a
great
invention
in
its
time
and
extremely
suitable
for
ecclesiastical
or
even
educational
edifices
of
various
kinds
its
time
of
usefulness
has
passed
and
that
men
widening
experience
in
structural
work
ever
since
has
carried
him
far
away
from
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
our
ecclesiastical
buildings
are
still
built
on
purely
gothic
lines
and
a
definite
effort
is
made
as
a
rule
to
have
the
completed
religious
edifice
combine
a
number
of
the
best
features
of
thirteenth
century
gothic
with
what
success
this
has
been
accomplished
can
best
be
appreciated
from
the
fact
that
none
of
the
modern
structures
attract
anything
like
the
attention
of
the
old
and
the
cathedrals
of
this
early
time
still
continue
to
be
the
best
asset
of
the
towns
in
which
they
are
situated
because
of
the
number
of
visitors
they
attract
far
from
considering
gothic
architecture
outlived
architects
still
apply
themselves
to
it
with
devotion
because
of
the
practical
suggestions
which
it
contains
and
there
are
those
of
wide
experience
who
still
continue
to
think
it
the
most
wonderful
example
of
architectural
development
that
has
ever
come
and
even
do
not
hesitate
to
foretell
a
great
future
for
it
reinach

story

matter

footnote
scribners

if
the
aim
of
architecture
considered
as
an
art
should
be
to
free
itself
as
much
as
possible
from
subjection
to
its
materials
it
may
be
said
that
no
buildings
have
more
successfully
realized
this
ideal
than
the
gothic
churches
and
there
is
more
to
be
said
in
this
connection
its
light
and
airy
system
of
construction
the
freedom
and
slenderness
of
its
supporting
skeleton
afford
as
it
were
a
presage
of
an
art
that
began
to
develop
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
of
metallic
architecture
with
the
help
of
metal
and
of
cement
reinforced
by
metal
bars
the
moderns
might
equal
the
most
daring
feats
of
the
gothic
architects
it
would
even
be
easy
for
them
to
surpass
them
without
endangering
the
solidity
of
the
structure
as
did
the
audacities
of
gothic
art
in
the
conflicts
that
obtain
between
the
two
elements
of
construction
solidity
and
open
space
everything
seems
to
show
that
the
principle
of
free
spaces
will
prevail
that
the
palaces
and
houses
of
the
future
will
be
flooded
with
air
and
light
that
the
formula
popularized
by
gothic
architecture
has
a
great
future
before
it
and
that
following
the
revival
of
the
style
from
the
sixteenth
century
to
our
own
day
we
shall
see
a
yet
more
enduring
renaissance
of
the
gothic
style
applied
to
novel
materials
it
would
be
a
mistake
however
to
think
that
the
gothic
cathedrals
were
impressive
only
because
of
their
grandeur
and
immense
size
it
would
be
still
more
a
mistake
to
consider
them
only
as
examples
of
a
great
development
in
architecture
they
are
much
more
than
this
they
are
the
compendious
expression
of
the
art
impulses
of
a
glorious
century
every
single
detail
of
the
gothic
cathedrals
is
not
only
worthy
of
study
but
deserving
of
admiration
if
not
for
itself
then
always
for
the
inadequate
means
by
which
it
was
secured
and
most
of
these
details
have
been
found
worthy
of
imitation
by
subsequent
generations
it
is
only
by
considering
the
separate
details
of
the
art
work
of
these
cathedrals
that
the
full
lesson
of
what
these
wonderful
people
accomplished
can
be
learned
there
have
been
many
centuries
since
in
which
they
would
be
entirely
unappreciated
fortunately
our
own
time
has
come
back
to
a
recognition
of
the
greatness
of
the
art
impulse
that
was
at
work
perfecting
even
what
might
be
considered
trivial
portions
of
the
cathedrals
and
the
brightest
hope
for
the
future
of
our
own
accomplishment
is
founded
on
this
belated
appreciation
of
work
it
has
been
said
that
the
medieval
workman
was
a
lively
symbol
of
the
creator
himself
in
the
way
in
which
he
did
his
work
it
mattered
not
how
obscure
the
portion
of
the
cathedral
at
which
he
was
set
he
decorated
it
as
beautifully
as
he
knew
how
without
a
thought
that
his
work
would
be
appreciated
only
by
the
very
few
that
might
see
it
trivial
details
were
finished
with
the
perfection
of
important
parts
microscopic
studies
in
recent
years
have
revealed
beautiful
designs
on

and
diatoms
which
are
far
beneath

high

cathedral
amiens
to
as
great
extent
as
it
is
possible
perhaps
for
man
to
secure
such
a
desideratum
the
thirteenth
century
workman
succeeded
in
this
same
purpose
it
is
for
this
reason
more
than
even
for
the
magnificent
grandeur
of
the
design
and
the
skilful
execution
with
inadequate
means
that
makes
the
gothic
cathedral
such
a
source
of
admiration
and
wonder
to
take
first
the
example
of
sculpture
it
is
usually
considered
that
the
thirteenth
century
represented
a
time
entirely
too
early
in
the
history
of
plastic
art
for
there
to
have
been
any
fine
examples
of
the
sculptor
chisel
left
us
from
it
any
such
impression
however
will
soon
be
corrected
if
one
but
examines
carefully
the
specimens
of
this
form
of
art
in
certain
cathedrals
as
we
have
said
probably
no
more
charmingly
dignified
presentation
of
the
human
form
divine
in
stone
has
ever
been
made
than
the
figure
of
christ
above
the
main
door
of
the
cathedral
of
amiens
which
the
amiennois
so
lovingly
call
their
beautiful
god
there
are
some
other
examples
of
statuary
in
the
same
cathedral
that
are
wonderful
specimens
of
the
sculptor
art
lending
itself
for
decorative
purposes
to
architecture
this
is
true
for
a
number
of
the
cathedrals
the
statues
in
themselves
are
not
so
beautiful
but
as
portions
of
a
definite
piece
of
structural
work
such
as
a
doorway
or
a
facade
they
are
wonderful
models
of
how
all
the
different
arts
became
subservient
to
the
general
effect
to
be
produced
it
was
at
rheims
however
that
sculpture
reached
its
acme
of
accomplishment
and
architects
have
been
always
unstinted
in
their
praise
of
this
feature
of
what
may
be
called
the
capitol
church
of
france
those
who
have
any
doubts
as
to
the
place
of
gothic
art
itself
in
art
history
and
who
need
an
authority
always
to
bolster
up
the
opinion
that
they
may
hold
will
find
ample
support
in
the
enthusiastic
opinion
of
an
authority
whom
we
have
quoted
already
the
most
interesting
and
significant
feature
of
his
ardent
expression
of
enthusiasm
is
his
comparison
of
romanesque
with
gothic
art
in
this
respect
the
amount
of
ground
covered
from
one
artistic
mode
to
the
other
is
greater
than
any
other
advance
in
art
that
has
ever
been
made
after
all
the
real
value
of
the
work
of
the
period
must
be
judged
rather
by
the
amount
of
progress
that
has
been
made
than
by
the
stage
of
advance
actually
reached
since
it
is
development
rather
than
accomplishment
that
counts
in
the
evolution
of
the
race
on
the
other
hand
it
will
be
found
that
reinach
opinion
of
the
actual
attainments
of
gothic
art
are
far
beyond
anything
that
used
to
be
thought
on
the
subject
a
half
century
ago
and
much
higher
than
any
but
a
few
of
the
modern
art
critics
hold
in
the
matter
he
says
in
contrast
to
this
romanesque
art
as
yet
in
bondage
to
convention
ignorant
or
disdainful
of
nature
the
mature
gothic
art
of
the
thirteenth
century
appeared
as
a
brilliant
revival
or
realism
the
great
sculptors
who
adorned
the
cathedrals
of
paris
amiens
rheims
and
chartres
with
their
works
were
realists
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
they
sought
in
nature
not
only
their
knowledge
of
human
forms
and
of
the
draperies
that
cover
them
but
also
that
of
the
principles
of
decoration
save
in
the
gargoyles
of
cathedrals
and
in
certain
minor
sculptures
we
no
longer
find
in
the
thirteenth
century
those
unreal
figures
of
animals
nor
those
ornaments
complicated
as
nightmares
which
load
the
capitals
of
romanesque
churches
the
flora
of
the
country
studied
with
loving
attention
is
the
sole
or
almost
the
sole
source
from
which
decorators
take
their
motives
it
is
in
this
charming
profusion
of
flowers
and
foliage
that
the
genius
of
gothic
architecture
is
most
freely
displayed
one
of
the
most
admirable
of
its
creations
is
the
famous
capital
of
the
vintage
in
notre
dame
at
rheims
carved
about
the
year
since
the
first
century
of
the
roman
empire

never
imitated

so
perfectly
nor
has
it
ever
since
done
so
with
a
like
grace
and
sentiment
reinach
defends
gothic
art
from
another
and
more
serious
objection
which
is
constantly
urged
against
it
by
those
who
know
only
certain
examples
of
it
but
have
not
had
the
advantage
of
the
wide
study
of
the
whole
field
of
artistic
endeavor
in
the
thirteenth
century
which
this
distinguished
member
of
the
institute
of
france
has
succeeded
in
obtaining
it
is
curious
what
unfounded
opinions
have
come
to
be
prevalent
in
art
circles
because
only
too
often
writers
with
regard
to
the
cathedrals
have
spent
their
time
mainly
in
the
large
cities
or
along
the
principal
arteries
of
travel
and
have
not
realized
that
some
of
the
smaller
towns
contained
work
better
fitted
to
illustrate
gothic
art
principles
than
those
on
which
they
depended
for
their
information
if
only
particular
phases
of
the
art
of
any
one
time
no
matter
how
important
were
to
be
considered
in
forming
a
judgment
of
it
that
judgment
would
almost
surely
be
unfavorable
in
many
ways
because
of
the
lack
of
completeness
of
view
this
is
what
has
happened
unfortunately
with
regard
to
gothic
art
but
a
better
spirit
is
coming
in
this
matter
with
the
more
careful
study
of
periods
of
art
and
the
return
of
reverence
for
the
grand
old
middle
ages
illustration
cathedral

reinach
says
there
are
certain
prejudices
against
this
admirable
though
incomplete
art
which
it
is
difficult
to
combat
it
is
often
said
for
instance
that
all
gothic
figures
are
stiff
and
emaciated
to
convince
ourselves
of
the
contrary
we
need
only
study
the
marvelous
sculpture
of
the
meeting
between
abraham
and
melchisedech
in
rheims
cathedral
or
again
in
the
same
cathedral
the
visitation

and
the
standing
angel
or
the
exquisite
magdalen
of
bordeaux
cathedral
what
can
we
see
in
these
that
is
stiff
sickly
and
puny
the
art
that
has
most
affinity
with
perfect
gothic
is
neither
romanesque
nor
byzantine
but
the
greek
art
of
from
to
by
a
strange
coincidence
the
gothic
artists
even
reproduce
the
somewhat
stereotyped
smile
of
their
forerunners
usually
it
is
said
that
the
renaissance
brought
the
supreme
qualities
of
greek
plastic
art
back
to
life
but
here
is
a
thoroughly
competent
critic
who
finds
them
exhibited
long
before
the
fifteenth
century
as
a
manifestation
of
what
the
generations
of
the
renaissance
would
have
called
gothic
meaning
thereby
barbarous
art
what
has
been
said
of
sculpture
however
can
be
repeated
with
even
more
force
perhaps
with
regard
to
every
detail
of
construction
and
decoration
builders
and
architects
did
make
mistakes
at
times
but
even
their
mistakes
always
reveal
an
artist
soul
struggling
for
expression
through
inadequate
media
many
things
had
to
be
done
experimentally
most
things
were
being
done
for
the
first
time
everything
had
an
originality
of
its
own
that
made
its
execution
something
more
than
merely
a
secure
accomplishment
after
previous
careful
tests
in
spite
of
this
state
of
affairs
which
might
be
expected
sadly
to
interfere
with
artistic
execution
the
cathedrals
in
the
main
are
full
of
admirable
details
not
only
worthy
of
imitation
but
that
our
designers
are
actually
imitating
or
at
least
finding
eminently
suggestive
at
the
present
time
to
begin
with
a
well
known
example
of
decorative
effect
which
is
found
in
the
earliest
of
the
english
cathedrals
that
of
lincoln
the
nave
and
choir
of
this
was
finished
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
choir
is
so
beautiful
in
its
conception
so
wonderful
in
its
construction
so
charming
in
its
finish
so
satisfactory
in
all
its
detail
though
there
is
very
little
of
what
would
be
called
striving
after
effect
in
it
that
it
is
still
called
the
angel
choir
the
name
was
originally
given
it
because
it
was
considered
to
be
so
beautiful
even
during
the
thirteenth
century
that
visitors
could
scarcely
believe
that
it
was
constructed
by
human
hands
and
so
the
legend
became
current
that
it
was
the
work
of
angels
if
the
critics
of
the
thirteenth
century
who
had
the
opportunity
to
see
work
of
nearly
the
same
kind
being
constructed
in
many
parts
of
england
judged
thus
highly
of
it
it
is
not
surprising
that
modern
visitors
should
be
unstinted
in
their
praise
it
is
interesting
to
note
as
representative
of
the
feeling
of
a
cultured
modern
scientific
mind
that
osler
said
not
long
ago
in
one
of
his
medical
addresses
that
probably
nothing
more
beautiful
had
ever
come
from
the
hands
of
man
than
this
angel
choir
at
lincoln
as
to
who
were
the
designers
who
conceived
it
or
the
workmen
who
executed
it
we
have
no
records
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
famous
hugh
of
lincoln
the
great
bishop
to
whom
the
cathedral
owes
its
foundation
and
much
of
its
splendor
was
responsible
to
no
little
extent
for
this
beautiful
feature
of
his
cathedral
church
the
workmen
who
made
it
were
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
other
beautiful
architectural
features
should
have
flourished
in
a
country
where
such
workmen
could
be
found
almost
as
impressive
as
the
angel
choir
was
the
stained
glass
work
at
lincoln
the
rose
windows
are
among
the
most
beautiful
ever
made
and
one
of
them
is
indeed
considered
a
gem
of
its
kind
the
beautiful
colors
and
wonderful
effectiveness
of
the
stained
glass
of
these
old
time
cathedrals
can
not
be
appreciated
unless
the
windows
themselves
are
actually
seen
at
lincoln
there
is
a
very
impressive
contrast
that
one
can
scarcely
help
calling
to
attention
and
that
has
been
very
frequently
the
subject
of
comment
by
visitors
during
the
parliamentary
time
unfortunately
the
stained
glass
at
lincoln
fell
under
the
ban
of
the
puritans
the
lower
windows
were
almost
completely
destroyed
by
the
soldiers
of
cromwell
army
only
the
rose
windows
owing
to
their
height
were
preserved
from
the
destroyer
there
was
an
old
sexton
at
the
cathedral
however
for
whom
the
stained
glass
had
become
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
as
boy
and
man
he
had
lived
in
its
beautiful
colors
as
they
broke
the
light
of
the
rising
and
the
setting
sun
and
they
were
too
precious
to
be
neglected
even
when
lying
upon
the
pavement
of
the
cathedral
in
fragments
he
gathered
the
shattered
pieces
into
bags
and
hid
them
away
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
crypt
saving
them
at
least
from
the
desecration
of
being
trampled
to
dust
long
afterwards
indeed
almost
in
our
own
time
they
were
found
here
and
were
seen
to
be
so
beautiful
that
regardless
of
the
fact
that
they
could
not
be
fitted
together
in
anything
like
their
former
places
they
were
pieced
into
windows
and
made
to
serve
their
original
purpose
once
more
it
so
happened
that
new
stained
glass
windows
for
the
cathedral
of
lincoln
were
ordered
during
the
nineteenth
century
these
were
made
at
an
unfortunate
time
in
stained
glass
making
and
are
as
nearly
absolutely
unattractive
to
say
nothing
worse
as
it
is
possible
to
make
stained
glass
the
contrast
with
the
antique
windows
fragmentary
as
they
are
made
up
of
the
broken
pieces
of
thirteenth
century
glass
is
most
striking
the
old
time
colors
are
so
rich
that
when
the
sun
shines
directly
on
them
they
look
like
jewels
no
one
pays
the
slightest
attention
unless
perhaps
the
doubtful
compliment
of
a
smile
be
given
to
the
modern
windows
which
were
however
very
costly
and
the
best
that
could
be
obtained
at
that
time
more
of
the
stained
glass
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
preserved
at
york
where
because
of
the
friendship
of
general
ireton
the
town
and
the
cathedral
were
spared
the
worst
ravages
of
the
parliamentarians
as
a
consequence
york
still
possesses
some
of
the
best
of
its
old
time
windows
it
is
probable
that
there
is
nothing
more
beautiful
or
wonderful
in
its
effectiveness
than
the
glass
in
the
five
sisters
window
at
york
this
is
only
an
ordinary
lancet
window
of
five
compartments
hence
the
name
in
the
west
front
of
the
cathedral
there
are
no
figures
on
the
window
it
is
only
a
mass
of
beautiful
greyish
green
tints
which
marvelously
subdues
the
western
setting
sun
at
the
vesper
hour
and
produces
the
most
beautiful
effects
in
the
interior
of
the
cathedral
here
if
anywhere
one
can
realize
the
meaning
of
the
expression
dim
religious
light
in
recent
years
however
it
has
become
the
custom
for
so
many
people
to
rave
over
the
five
sisters
that
we
are
spared
the
necessity
of
more
than
mentioning
it
its
tints
far
from
being
injured
by
time
have
probably
been
enriched
there
can
be
no
doubt
at
all
however
of
the
artistic
tastes
and
esthetic
genius
of
the
man
who
designed
it
the
other
windows
of
the
cathedral
were
not
unworthy
of
this
triumph
of
art
how
truly
the
cathedral
was
a
technical
school
can
be
appreciated
from
the
fact
that
it
was
able
to
inspire
such
workmen
to
produce
these
wondrous
effects
experts
in
stained
glass
work
have
often
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
windows
constructed
in
the
thirteenth
century
were
not
only
of
greater
artistic
value
but
were
also
more
solidly
put
together
many
of
the
windows
made
in
the
century
still
maintain
their
places
in
spite
of
the
passage
of
time
though
later
windows
are
sometimes
dropping
to
pieces
it
might
be
thought
that
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
later
stained
glass
workers
were
more
delicate
in
the
construction
of
their
windows
in
order
not
to
injure
the
effect
of
the
stained
glass
to
some
extent
this
is
true
but
the
stained
glass
workers
of
the
thirteenth
century
preserve
the
effectiveness
of
their
artistic
pictures
in
glass
though
making
the
frame
work
very
substantial
this
is
only
another
example
of
their
ability
to
combine
the
useful
with
the
beautiful
so
characteristic
of
the
century
stamping
practically
every
phase
of
its
accomplishment
and
making
their
work
more
admirable
because
its
usefulness
does
not
suffer
on
account
of
any
strained
efforts
after
supposed
beauties
though
it
is
somewhat
out
of
place
here
we
can
not
refrain
from
pointing
out
the
educational
value
of
this
stained
glass
work
some
of
the
stories
on
these
windows
gave
details
of
many
passages
from
the
bible
that
must
have
impressed
them
upon
the
people
much
more
than
any
sermon
or
reading
of
the
text
could
possibly
have
accomplished
they
were
literally
sermons
in
glass
that
he
who
walked
by
had
to
read
whether
he
would
or
not
when
we
remember
that
the
common
people
in
the
middle
ages
had
no
papers
to
distract
them
and
no
books
to
turn
to
for
information
such
illustrations
as
were
provided
by
the
stained
glass
windows
by
the
painting
and
the
statuary
decorations
of
the
cathedrals
must
have
been
studied
with
fondest
devotion
even
apart
from
religious
sentiment
and
out
of
mere
inquisitiveness
the
famous
prodigal
window
at
chartres
is
a
good
example
of
this
every
detail
of
the
story
is
here
pictorially
displayed
in
colors
from
the
time
when
the
young
man
demands
his
patrimony
through
all
the
various
temptations
he
met
with
in
being
helped
to
spend
it
there
being
a
naive
richness
of
detail
in
the
matter
of
the
temptations
that
is
quite
medieval
from
the
boon
companions
who
first
led
him
astray
to
the
depths
of
degradation
which
he
finally
reached
before
he
returned
to
his
father
even
the
picture
of
the
fatted
calf
is
not
lacking
on
others
of
these
windows
there
are
the
stories
of
the
patron
saints
of
certain
crafts
the
life
of
crispin
the
shoemaker
is
given
in
rather
full
detail
the
same
is
true
of
romain
the
hunter
who
was
the
patron
of
the
furriers
the
most
ordinary
experiences
of
life
are
pictured
and
the
methods
by
which
these
were
turned
to
account
in
making
the
craftsman
a
saint
must
have
been
in
many
ways
an
ideally
uplifting
example
for
fellow
craftsmen
whenever
they
viewed
the
window
this
sort
of
teaching
could
not
be
without
its
effect
upon
the
poor
it
taught
them
that
there
was
something
else
in
life
besides
money
getting
and
that
happiness
and
contentment
might
be
theirs
in
a
chosen
occupation
and
the
reward
of
heaven
at
the
end
of
it
all
for
at
the
top
of
these
windows
the
hand
of
the
almighty
is
introduced
reaching
down
from
heaven
to
reward
his
faithful
servants
it
is
just
by
such
presentation
of
ideals
even
to
the
poor
that
the
thirteenth
century
differs
from
the
modern
time
in
which
even
the
teaching
in
the
schools
seems
only
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
men
must
get
money
honestly
if
they
can
but
must
get
money
if
they
would
have
what
is
called
success
in
life
another
very
interesting
feature
of
these
windows
is
the
fact
that
they
were
usually
the
gifts
of
the
various
guilds
and
so
represented
much
more
of
interest
for
the
members
it
is
true
that
in
france
particularly
the
monarchs
frequently
presented
stained
glass
windows
and
in
louis
time
this
was
so
common
that
scarcely
a
french
cathedral
was
without
one
or
more
testimonials
of
this
kind
to
his
generosity
but
most
of
the
windows
were
given
by
various
societies
among
the
people
themselves
how
much
the
construction
of
such
a
window
when
it
was
well
done
would
make
for
the
education
in
taste
of
those
who
contributed
to
the
expense
of
its
erection
can
scarcely
be
there
was
besides
a
friendly
rivalry
in
this
matter
in
the
thirteenth
century
which
served
to
bring
out
the
talents
of
local
artists
and
by
the
inevitably
suggested
comparisons
eventually
served
to
educate
the
taste
of
the
people
it
must
not
be
thought
however
that
it
was
only
in
stained
glass
and
painting
and
sculpture
the
major
arts
that
these
workmen
attained
their
triumphs
practically
every
detail
of
cathedral
construction
is
a
monument
to
the
artistic
genius
of
the
century
to
the
wonderful
inspiration
afforded
the
workmen
and
to
the
education
provided
by
the
guilds
which
really
maintained
as
we
shall
see
a
kind
of
technical
school
with
the
approbation
and
the
fostering
care
of
the
ecclesiastics
connected
with
the
cathedrals
an
excellent
example
of
a
very
different
class
of
work
may
be
noted
in
the
hinges
of
the
cloister
door
of
the
cathedral
at
york
personally
i
have
seen
three
art
designers
sketching
these
at
the
same
time
only
one
of
whom
was
an
englishman
another
coming
from
the
continent
and
the
third
from
america
the
hinge
still
swings
the
heavy
oak
door
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
arborization
of
the
metal
as
it
spreads
out
from
the
main
shaft
of
the
hinge
is
beautifully
decorative
in
effect
illustration
cloister
of
paul
without
the
walls
rome
a
little
study
of
the
hinge
seems
to
show
that
these
branching
portions
were
so
arranged
as
to
make
the
mechanical
moment
of
the
swinging
door
less
of
a
dead
weight
than
it
would
have
been
if
the
hinge
were
a
solid
bar
of
iron
besides
the
spreading
of
the
branches
over
a
wide
surface
serves
to
hold
the
woodwork
of
the
door
thoroughly
in
place
while
the
hinge
was
beautiful
then
it
was
eminently
useful
from
a
good
many
standpoints
and
trivial
though
it
might
be
considered
to
be
it
was
in
reality
a
type
of
all
the
work
accomplished
in
connection
with
these
thirteenth
century
cathedrals
according
to
the
old
latin
proverb
tulit
punctum
qui
miscuit
utile
he
scores
every
point
who
mingles
the
useful
with
the
beautiful
and
certainly
the
thirteenth
century
workman
succeeded
in
accomplishing
the
desideratum
to
an
eminent
degree
this
mingling
of
the
useful
and
the
beautiful
is
of
itself
a
supreme
difference
between
the
thirteenth
century
generations
and
our
own
yeats
the
well
known
irish
poet
in
bidding
farewell
to
america
some
years
ago
said
to
a
party
of
friends
that
no
country
could
consider
itself
to
be
making
real
progress
in
culture
until
the
very
utensils
in
the
kitchen
were
beautiful
as
well
as
useful
anything
that
is
merely
useful
is
hideous
and
anyone
who
can
handle
such
things
with
impunity
has
not
true
culture
in
the
thirteenth
century
they
never
by
any
chance
made
anything
that
was
merely
useful
especially
not
if
it
was
to
be
associated
with
their
beloved
cathedral
an
excellent
example
of
this
can
be
found
in
their
chalices
and
other
ceremonial
utensils
which
were
meant
for
divine
service
as
we
have
said
elsewhere
the
craftsman
the
journal
of
the
arts
and
crafts
movement
in
this
country
not
long
since
compared
a
chalice
of
the
thirteenth
century
with
the
prize
cups
which
are
offered
for
yacht
races
and
other
competitions
in
this
country
we
may
say
at
once
that
the
form
which
the
chalice
received
during
the
thirteenth
century
is
that
which
constitutes
to
a
great
extent
the
model
for
this
sacred
vessel
ever
since
and
the
comparison
with
the
modern
design
is
therefore
all
the
more
interesting
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
money
is
no
object
as
a
rule
in
the
construction
of
many
of
the
modern
prize
cups
they
compare
unfavorably
according
to
the
writer
in
the
craftsman
with
the
old
time
chalices
there
is
a
tendency
to
over
ornamentation
which
spoils
the
effectiveness
of
the
lines
of
the
metal
work
in
many
cases
and
there
is
also
only
too
often
an
attempt
to
introduce
forms
of
plastic
art
which
do
not
lend
themselves
well
to
this
class
of
work
it
is
in
design
particularly
that
the
older
workman
excels
his
modern
colleague
though
usually
there
are
suggestions
from
several
sources
for
present
day
work
in
a
word
the
thirteenth
century
chalice
was
much
more
admirable
than
the
modern
piece
of
metal
work
because
the
lines
were
simpler
the
combination
of
beauty
with
utility
more
readily
recognizable
and
the
obtrusiveness
of
the
ornamentation
much
less
marked
this
same
thing
is
true
for
other
even
coarser
forms
of
metal
work
in
connection
with
the
cathedrals
and
anyone
who
has
seen
some
of
the
beautiful
iron
screens
built
for
cathedral
choirs
in
the
olden
times
will
realize
that
even
the
worker
in
iron
must
have
been
an
artist
as
well
as
a
blacksmith
the
effect
produced
especially
in
the
dim
light
of
the
cathedral
is
often
that
of
delicate
lace
work
to
appreciate
the
strength
of
the
screen
one
must
actually
test
it
with
the
hands
this
of
itself
represents
a
very
charming
adaptation
of
what
might
be
expected
to
be
rough
work
meant
for
protective
purposes
into
a
suitable
ornament
some
of
the
gates
of
the
old
churchyards
are
very
beautiful
in
their
designs
and
have
often
been
imitated
in
quite
recent
years
for
the
gates
of
country
places
for
our
modern
millionaires
the
reverend
augustus
jessopp
who
has
written
much
with
regard
to
the
times
before
the
reformation
says
that
he
has
found
in
his
investigations
that
not
infrequently
such
gates
were
made
by
the
village
blacksmiths
most
of
the
old
parish
records
are
lost
because
of
the
suppression
of
the
parishes
as
well
as
the
monasteries
in
henry
the
eighth
time
some
of
the
original
documents
are
however
preserved
and
among
them
are
receipts
from
the
village
blacksmith
for
what
we
now
admire
as
specimens
of
artistic
ironwork
and
corresponding
receipts
from
the
village
carpenter
for
woodwork
that
we
now
consider
of
equally
high
order
there
were
carved
bench
ends
and
choir
stalls
which
seem
to
have
been
produced
in
this
way
just
how
these
generations
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
little
towns
of
less
than
ten
thousand
inhabitants
succeeded
in
raising
up
artisans
in
numbers
capable
of
doing
such
fine
work
and
yet
content
to
make
their
living
at
such
ordinary
occupations
is
indeed
hard
to
understand
it
must
not
be
forgotten
moreover
that
though
there
was
not
much
furniture
during
the
thirteenth
century
what
little
there
was
was
as
a
rule
very
carefully
and
artistically
made
thirteenth
century
benches
and
tables
are
famous
cathedrals
and
castles
worked
together
in
inspiring
and
giving
occupation
to
these
wonderful
workmen
it
was
not
only
the
workmen
engaged
in
the
construction
of
the
edifices
proper
who
made
the
beautiful
things
and
created
marvelously
artistic
treasures
during
this
century
all
the
adornments
of
the
cathedrals
and
especially
everything
associated
in
any
intimate
way
with
the
religious
service
was
sure
to
be
executed
with
the
most
delicate
taste
the
vestments
of
the
time
are
some
of
the
most
beautiful
that
have
ever
been
made
the
historians
of
needlework
tell
us
that
this
period
represents
the
most
flourishing
era
of
artistic
accomplishment
with
the
needle
of
all
modern
history
one
example
of
this
has
secured
a
large
share
of
notoriety
in
quite
recent
years
an
american
millionaire
bought
the
famous
piece
of
needlework
known
as
the
cope
of
ascoli
this
is
an
example
of
the
large
garment
worn
over
the
shoulders
in
religious
processions
and
at
benediction
the
price
paid
for
the
garment
is
said
to
have
been
this
was
not
considered
extortionate
or
enforced
as
the
cope
was
declared
by
experts
to
be
one
of
the
finest
pieces
of
needlework
in
the
world
the
jewels
which
originally
adorned
it
had
been
removed
so
that
the
money
was
paid
for
the
needlework
itself
after
a
time
it
became
clear
that
the
cope
had
been
stolen
before
being
sold
and
accordingly
it
was
returned
to
the
italian
government
who
presented
the
american
millionaire
with
a
medal
for
his
honesty
we
have
spoken
of
the
cathedrals
as
great
stone
books
in
which
he
who
ran
might
read
even
though
he
were
not
able
to
read
in
the
technical
sense
of
the
term
this
has
been
an
expression
with
regard
to
the
cathedrals
but
not
even
its
inventor
perhaps
and
certainly
not
most
of
those
who
have
repeated
it
have
realized
how
literally
true
was
the
saying
i
have
elsewhere
quoted
from
reinach
story
of
art
throughout
the
ages
as
an
authority
on
the
subject
his
of
the
intellectual
significance
for
the
people
of
the
cathedrals
of
their
towns
in
which
it
must
be
remembered
that
they
had
a
personal
interest
because
in
a
sense
they
were
really
theirs
and
they
felt
their
ownership
quite
as
much
as
a
modern
member
of
a
parish
feels
with
regard
to
his
church
emphasizes
and
illuminates
this
subject
to
a
wonderful
degree
the
realization
that
the
information
of
the
time
was
deliberately
woven
into
these
great
stone
structures
mainly
of
course
for
decorative
purposes
but
partly
also
with
the
idea
of
educating
the
people
is
a
startling
confirmation
of
the
idea
that
education
was
the
most
important
and
significant
work
of
this
great
century
the
gothic
cathedral
is
a
perfect
encyclopedia
of
human
knowledge
it
contains
scenes
from
the
scriptures
and
the
legends
of
saints
motives
from
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdom
representations
of
the
seasons
of
agricultural
labor
of
the
arts
and
sciences
and
crafts
and
finally
moral
allegories
as
for
instance
ingenious
personifications
of
the
virtues
and
the
vices
in
the
thirteenth
century
a
learned
dominican
vincent
of
beauvais
was
employed
by
louis
to
write
a
great
work
which
was
to
be
an
epitome
of
all
the
knowledge
of
his
times
this
compilation
called
the
mirror
of
the
world
is
divided
into
four
parts
the
mirror
of
nature
the
mirror
of
science
the
moral
mirror
and
the
historical
mirror
a
contemporary
archaeologist
male
has
shown
that
the
works
of
art
of
our
great
cathedrals
are
a
translation
into
stone
of
the
mirror
of
vincent
of
beauvais
setting
aside
the
episodes
from
greek
and
roman
history
which
would
have
been
out
of
place
it
was
not
that
the
imagers
had
read
vincent
work
but
that
like
him
they
sought
to
epitomise
all
the
knowledge
of
their
contemporaries
the
first
aim
of
their
art
is
not
to
please
but
to
teach
they
offer
an
encyclopedia
for
the
use
of
those
who
can
not
read
translated
by
sculptor
or
into
a
clear
and
precise
language
under
the
lofty
direction
of
the
church
which
left
nothing
to
chance
it
was
present
always
and
everywhere
advising
and
superintending
the
artist
leaving
him
to
his
own
devices
only
when
he
modelled
the
fantastic
animals
of
the
gargoyles
or
borrowed
decorative
motives
from
the
vegetable
kingdom

for
those

in

only
a
careful
study
of

enable

understand
modern

have
lost
most
of
their
appreciation

the
occupation

little

no
room
for
the

the
profounder
thought
an

may
care
to
put
into
his
work
and
so
the
modern
artist
tells
his
story
as
far
as
possible
without
any
of
this
deeper
significance
since
it
would
only
be
lost
in
the
thirteenth
century
however
everything
artistic
had
a
secondary
meaning
literature
was
full
of
allegories
even
the
arthur
legends
were
considered
to
be
the
expression
of
the
battle
of
a
soul
with
worldly
influences
as
well
as
a
poetic
presentation
of
the
story
of
the
old
time
british
king
the
gothic
cathedrals
were
a
mass
of
symbolism
this
will
perhaps
be
best
understood
from
the
following
explanation
of
cathedral
symbolism
which
we
take
from
the
translation
of
work
on
the
meaning
of
the
divine
offices
a
further
account
of
which
will
be
found
in

chapter
on

prose
of
the

away
and
long
ere
we
can
catch
the
first
view
of
the
city
itself
the
three
spires
of
its
cathedral
rising
high
above
its
din
and
turmoil
preach
to
us
of
the
most
high
and
undivided
trinity
as
we
approach
the

striking
out
crosswise
tell
of
the
atonement
the
communion
of

set
forth
by
the
chapels
clustering
around

the

weathercock
bids
us
to
watch
and
pray
and
endure
hardness
the
hideous

that
are
seen
hurrying

the

cast

all
these
overpowering

teach
us
that
vanquishing

also
should
ascend
in

lessons
of
holy
wisdom
are
written
in
the
delicate
tracery
of

the

of

is
shadowed
forth
by
the
multiplex

the

and
the

typify
those

of
the
spirit
by
whom
alone
we
can
tread
in

the

itself
glows
with
gold
and

with

for
they
have
on
their
heads
golden
crowns
with
crimson
for
they
passed
the
red
sea
of
martyrdom
to
obtain
them
and
through
the
delicate
network
and
the
unfolding
holy
doors
we
catch
faint
glimpses
of
the

beyond

in

everlasting

there
are
the

round

there
is
the

they
have
washed
their

made
them
white

there
heart

life

all
the

its
unquenched

golden

even

by
whose

merits
we
find
admission
to

verily
as
we
think
on
the
oneness
of
its
design
we
may
say
jerusalem

ut

cujus
participatio

it
is
because
of
all
this
wealth
of
meaning
embodied
in

that
the
cathedrals
of
this
old

continue
to
be
so
interesting

unfailingly
attractive

to

distant
and
so
differently

those
who
care
to
realize
to
some
degree
all
the
wonderful
symbolic
meaning
of
the

of
some
of
these
cathedrals
should
read
huysman

which
has
we
believe
been
translated
into
english
needless
to
say
it
has
been
often
in
our
hands
in
compiling
this
chapter
and
the
death
of
its
author
as
this
chapter
is
going
through
the
press
poignantly
recalls
all
the
beauty
of
his
work
we
can
not
close
this
chapter
on
the
book
of
the
arts
leaving
the
impression
that
only
the
church
architecture
of
the
time
deserves
to
be
considered
in
the
category
of
great
art
influences
there
were
many
municipal
buildings
some
stately
castles
and
a
large
number
of
impressively
magnificent
abbeys
and
monasteries
besides
educational
and
charitable
institutions
built
at
this
same
time
the
town
halls
of
some
of
the
great
hansa
towns
that
is
the
german
free
cities
that
were
members
of
the
hanseatic
league
present
some
very
striking
examples
of
the
civil
architecture
of
the
period
it
has
the
same
characteristics
that
we
have
discussed
in
treating
of
the
cathedrals
while
wonderfully
impressive
it
was
eminently
suitable
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
and
the
decorations
always
forming
integral
parts
of
the
structure
sounded
the
note
of
the
combination
of
beauty
with
utility
which
is
so
characteristic
of
every
phase
of
the
art
accomplishment
of
the
century
some
of
the
castles
would
deserve
special
description
by
themselves
but
unfortunately
space
forbids
more
than
a
passing
mention
certain
castellated
fortresses
still
standing
in
england
and
ireland
come
from
the
time
of
king
john
and
are
excellent
examples
of
the
stability
and
forceful
character
of
this
form
of
architecture
in
the
thirteenth
century
it
is
interesting
to
find
that
when
we
come
to
build
in
the
twentieth
century
in
america
the
armories
which
are
to
be
used
for
the
training
of
our
militia
and
the
storage
of
arms
and
ammunition
many
of
the
ideas
used
in
their
construction
are
borrowed
from
this
olden
time

king

limerick
there
is
a
famous
castle
in
limerick
ireland
built
in
john
time
which
constituted
an
excellent
example
of
this
and
which
has
doubtlessly
often
been
studied
and
more
or
less
imitated
one
portion
of
kenilworth
castle
in
england
dates
from
the
thirteenth
century
and
has
been
often
the
subject
of
careful
study
by
modern
architects
the
same
thing
might
be
said
of
many
others
with
regard
to
the
english
abbeys
too
much
can
not
be
said
in
praise
of
their
architecture
and
it
has
been
the
model
for
large
educational
and
municipal
buildings
ever
since
mary
abbey
at
york
though
only
a
few
scattered
fragments
of
its
beauties
are
to
be
seen
and
very
little
of
its
walls
still
stand
is
almost
as
interesting
as
yorkminster
the
great
cathedral
itself
there
were
many
such
abbeys
as
this
built
in
england
during
the
thirteenth
century
more
than
a
dozen
of
them
at
least
and
probably
a
full
score
all
of
them
are
as
distinguished
in
the
history
of
architecture
as
the
english
cathedrals
it
will
be
remembered
that
what
is
now
called
westminster
abbey
was
not
a
cathedral
church
but
only
a
monastery
church
attached
to
the
abbey
of
westminster
and
this
the
only
well
preserved
example
of
its
class
furnishes
an
excellent
idea
of
what
these
religious
institutions
signify
in
the
thirteenth
century
they
meant
as
much
for
the
art
impulse
as
the
cathedrals
themselves
one
feature
of
these
monastic
establishments
deserves
special
mention
the
cloisters
were
usually
constructed
so
beautifully
as
to
make
them
veritable
gems
of
the
art
of
the
period
these
cloisters
were
the
porticos
usually
surrounding
a
garden
of
the
monastery
within
which
the
monks
could
walk
shaded
from
the
sun
and
protected
from
the
rain
and
the
snow
they
might
very
easily
have
been
hideously
useful
porches
especially
as
they
were
quite
concealed
from
the
outer
world
as
a
rule
and
those
not
belonging
to
the
order
were
not
admitted
to
them
except
on
very
special
occasions
the
name
cloister
signifies
an
enclosed
place
and
lay
persons
were
not
ordinarily
admitted
to
them
those
who
know
anything
about
them
will
recall
what
beautiful
constructive
work
was
put
into
them
certain
examples
as
that
of
john
lateran
in
rome
and
the
cloister
of
paul
without
the
walls
some
five
miles
from
rome
constructed
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
under
the
influence
of
the
same
great
art
movement
as
gave
the
cathedrals
are
the
most
beautiful
specimens
that
now
remain
the
only
thing
that
they
can
be
compared
with
is
the
famous
angel
choir
at
lincoln
which
indeed
they
recall
in
many
ways
the
pictures
of
these
two
cloisters
which
we
present
will
give
some
idea
of
their
beauty
to
be
thoroughly
appreciated
however
they
must
be
seen
for
there
is
a
delicacy
of
finish
about
every
detail
that
makes
them
an
unending
source
of
admiration
and
brings
people
back
again
and
again
to
see
them
yet
always
to
find
something
new
and
apparently
unnoticed
before
it
might
be
thought
that
the
studied
variety
in
the
columns
so
that
no
two
are
of
exactly
the
same
form
would
produce
a
bizarre
effect
the
lack
of
symmetry
that
might
result
from
this
same
feature
could
be
expected
to
spoil
their
essential
beauty
neither
of
these
effects
has
been
produced
however
the
cloisters
were
moreover
not
purple
patches
on
monasteries
but
ever
worthy
portions
of
very
beautiful
buildings
all
of
these
buildings
were
furnished
as
regards
their
metal
work
their
wood
work
and
the
portions
that
lent
themselves
to
decoration
in
the
same
spirit
as
the
cathedrals
themselves
the
magnificent
tables
and
benches
of
the
thirteenth
century
are
still
considered
to
be
the
best
models
of
simplicity
of
line
with
beauty
of
form
and
eminent
durability
in
the
history
of
furniture
making
the
fashion
for
colonial
furniture
in
our
own
time
has
brought
us
nearer
to
such
thirteenth
century
furniture
making
than
has
been
true
at
any
other
time
in
history
here
once
more
there
was
one
of
these
delightful
combinations
of
beauty
and
utility
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
century
even
the
kitchen
utensils
were
beautiful
as
well
as
useful
and
the
irish
poet
might
have
been
satisfied
to
his
heart
content

certain
other
architectural
forms
were
wonderfully
developed
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
the
opening
years
of
the
fourteenth
century
while
men
trained
during
the
former
period
were
still
at
work
giotto
tower
for
instance
must
be
considered
a
thirteenth
century
product
since
its
architect
was
well
past
years
of
age
before
the
thirteenth
century
closed
and
all
his
artistic
character
had
been
formed
under
its
precious
inspiration
it
is
a
curious
reflection
on
modern
architecture
that
some
of
the
modern
high
business
buildings
are
saved
from
being
hideous
just
in
as
much
as
they
approach
the
character
of
some
of
these
structures
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
first
of
new
york
skyscrapers
which
is
said
to
have
escaped
the
stigma
of
being
utterly
ugly
as
most
of
them
are
because
of
their
appeal
to
mere
utility
was
the
new
york
times
building
which
is
just
giotto
tower
on
a
large
scale
set
down
on
broadway
at
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
seen
from
a
mile
away
the
effect
is
exactly
that
of
the
great
florentine
architect
beautiful
structure
and
this
was
of
course
the
deliberate
intention
of
the
modern
architect
anyone
who
would
think
however
that
our
modern
business
building
with
its
plain
walls
recalls
in
any
adequate
sense
its
great
pattern
should
read
what
ruskin
has
said
with
regard
to
the
wealth
of
meaning
that
is
to
be
found
in
tower
into
such
structures
just
as
into
the
cathedrals
the
architects
and
builders
of
the
time
succeeded
in
putting
a
whole
burden
of
suggestion
which
to
the
generations
of
the
time
in
which
they
were
built
accustomed
to
the
symbolism
of
every
art
feature
in
life
around
them
had
a
precious
wealth
of
significance
that
we
can
only
appreciate
after
deep
study
and
long
contemplation
we
have
felt
that
only
the
quotation
from
ruskin
himself
can
fully
illustrate
what
we
wish
to
convey
in
this
matter
of
these
representations
of
human
art
under
heavenly
guidance
the
series
of
basreliefs
which
stud
the
base
of
this
tower
of
must
be
held
certainly
the
chief
in
europe
at
first
you
may
be
surprised
at
the
smallness
of
their
scale
in
proportion
to
their
masonry
but
this
smallness
of
scale
enabled
the
master
workmen
of
the
tower
to
execute
them
with
their
own
hands
and
for
the
rest
in
the
very
finest
architecture
the
decoration
of
most
precious
kind
is
usually
thought
of
as
a
jewel
and
set
with
space
round
it
as
the
jewels
of
a
crown
or
the
clasp
of
a
girdle
vii
arts
and
crafts
great
technical
schools
the
most
interesting
social
movement
in
our
time
is
undoubtedly
that
of
the
arts
and
crafts
its
central
idea
is
to
lift
the
workmen
up
above
the
mere
machine
that
he
is
likely
to
become
as
the
result
of
the
monotonous
occupation
at
some
trade
that
requires
him
only
to
do
a
constantly
repeated
series
of
acts
or
direct
one
little
portion
of
machinery
and
so
kills
the
soul
in
him
of
course
the
other
idea
that
a
generation
of
workmen
shall
be
created
who
will
be
able
to
make
beautiful
things
for
the
use
of
the
household
as
well
as
the
adornment
of
the
house
is
another
principal
purpose
too
many
people
have
mistaken
this
entirely
secondary
aim
of
the
movement
for
its
primary
end
it
is
because
of
the
effect
upon
the
workman
himself
of
the
effort
to
use
his
intellect
in
the
designing
his
taste
in
the
arrangement
and
his
artisan
skill
for
the
execution
of
beautiful
things
that
the
arts
and
crafts
movement
has
its
appeal
to
the
generality
of
mankind
the
success
of
the
movement
promises
to
do
more
to
solve
social
problems
than
all
the
socialistic
agitation
that
is
at
present
causing
so
much
dismay
in
some
quarters
and
raising
so
many
hopes
that
are
destined
to
be
disappointed
in
the
hearts
of
the
laboring
classes
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
social
unrest
is
to
be
found
not
in
creating
new
wants
for
people
and
giving
them
additional
wages
that
will
still
further
stimulate
their
desire
to
have
many
things
that
will
continue
to
be
in
spite
of
increased
wages
beyond
their
means
but
rather
to
give
them
such
an
interest
in
their
life
work
that
their
principal
source
of
pleasure
is
to
be
found
in
their
occupation
unfortunately
work
has
come
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
drudgery
and
as
men
must
spend
the
greater
portion
of
their
lives
at
least
the
vast
majority
of
them
must
in
doing
something
that
will
enable
them
to
make
a
living
it
is
clear
that
unhappiness
and
discontent
will
still
continue
blessed
is
the
man
who
has
found
his
work
blessed
is
the
man
to
whom
his
work
appeals
with
so
much
interest
that
he
goes
from
it
with
a
longing
to
be
able
to
finish
what
he
has
been
at
and
comes
back
to
it
with
a
prospect
that
now
he
shall
be
able
to
accomplish
what
time
and
perhaps
fatigue
would
not
allow
him
to
proceed
with
the
day
before
this
is
the
best
feature
of
the
promises
held
out
by
the
arts
and
crafts
movement
that
men
shall
be
interested
in
the
work
they
do
this
may
seem
to
some
people
an
unrealizable
idea
and
a
poetic
aspiration
rather
than
a
possible
actuality
a
little
study
of
what
was
accomplished
in
this
line
during
the
thirteenth
century
will
surely
prove
even
to
the
most
skeptical
how
much
of
success
is
capable
of
being
realized
in
this
matter
the
men
who
worked
around
the
cathedrals
were
given
opportunities
to
express
themselves
and
the
best
that
was
in
them
as
no
class
of
workmen
before
or
since
have
ever
had
the
opportunity
every
single
portion
of
the
cathedral
was
to
be
made
as
beautiful
as
the
mind
of
man
could
conceive
his
taste
could
plan
and
his
hands
could
achieve
as
a
consequence
the
carpenter
had
the
chance
to
express
himself
in
the
woodwork
the
village
blacksmith
the
opportunity
to
display
his
skill
in
such
small
ironwork
as
the
hinges
or
the
latch
for
the
door
and
every
workman
felt
called
upon
to
do
the
best
that
was
in
him
it
is
easy
to
understand
under
these
circumstances
with
what
interest
the
men
must
have
applied
themselves
to
their
tasks
they
were
as
a
rule
the
designers
as
well
as
the
executors
of
the
work
assigned
them
they
planned
and
executed
in
the
rough
and
tried
then
modified
and
adapted
until
finally
as
we
know
of
most
of
the
cathedrals
their
finished
product
was
as
nearly
perfect
in
most
particulars
as
it
is
ordinarily
given
to
man
to
achieve
their
aim
above
all
was
to
make
such
a
combination
of
utility
with
beauty
of
line
yet
simplicity
of
finish
as
would
make
their
work
worthy
counterparts
of
all
the
other
portions
of
the
cathedral
the
sense
of
competition
must
have
stirred
men
to
the
very
depths
of
their
souls
and
yet
it
was
not
the
heartless
rivalry
that
crushes
when
it
succeeds
but
the
inspiring
emulation
that
makes
one
do
as
well
as
or
better
than
others
though
not
necessarily
in
such
a
way
as
to
belittle
others
efforts

in

days
england
used
to
be
called

england
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
workmen
would
be
profoundly
merry
at
heart
when
they
had
the
consciousness
of
accomplishing
such
good
work
men
must
have
almost
tardily
quitted
their
labor
in
the
evening
while
they
hoped
and
strove
to
accomplish
something
that
would
be
worthy
of
the
magnificent
building
in
which
so
many
of
their
fellow
workmen
were
achieving
triumphs
of
handicraftsmanship
each
went
home
to
rest
for
the
night
but
also
to
dream
over
what
he
might
be
able
to
do
and
awoke
in
the
morning
with
the
thought
that
possibly
would
see
some
noteworthy
result
this
represents
the
ideal
of
the
workman
life
he
has
an
interest
quite
apart
from
the
mere
making
of
money
the
picture
of
the
modern
workman
by
contrast
looks
vain
and
sordid
the
vast
majority
of
our
workmen
labor
merely
because
they
must
make
enough
money
in
order
that
they
may
be
able
to
buy
food
enough
so
as
to
get
strength
to
work
of
interest
there
is
very
little
day
after
day
there
is
the
task
of
providing
for
self
and
others
only
this
and
nothing
more
is
it
any
wonder
that
there
should
be
social
unrest
and
discontentment
how
can
workmen
be
merry
unless
with
the
artificial
stimulus
of
strong
drink
when
there
is
nothing
for
them
to
look
forward
to
except
days
and
weeks
and
years
of
labor
succeeding
one
another
remorselessly
and
with
no
surcease
until
nature
puts
in
her
effective
demand
for
rest
or
the
inevitable
end
comes
it
would
be
idle
to
say
that
these
men
who
knew
how
to
make
the
beautiful
things
for
these
cathedrals
were
not
conscious
of
the
perfection
of
the
work
that
they
were
accomplishing
the
very
fact
that
each
in
his
own
line
was
achieving
such
beautiful
results
must
have
stamped
him
as
thoroughly
capable
of
appreciating
the
work
of
others
the
source
of
pleasure
that
there
must
have
been
therefore
in
some
twenty
towns
in
england
alone
to
see
their
cathedral
approaching
completion
must
have
been
of
itself
a
joy
far
beyond
anything
we
can
imagine
as
possible
for
the
workmen
of
the
present
day
the
interest
in
it
was
supreme
and
was
only
heightened
by
the
fact
that
it
was
being
done
by
relatives
and
friends
and
brother
workmen
even
though
they
might
be
rivals
and
that
whatever
was
done
was
redounding
first
to
the
glory
of
the
lord
to
whom
they
turned
with
so
much
confidence
in
these
ages
of
faith
and
secondly
and
there
was
scarcely
less
satisfaction
in
the
thought
to
the
reputation
of
their
native
town
and
their
this
is
the
feature
of
the
life
of
the
lower
classes
in
the
thirteenth
century
which
most
deserves
to
be
studied
in
our
time
we
hear
much
of
people
being
kept
in
ignorance
and
in
servitude
men
who
talk
this
way
know
nothing
at
all
of
the
lives
of
the
towns
of
the
middle
ages
and
are
able
to
appreciate
not
even
in
the
slightest
degree
the
wonderful
system
of
education
that
made
life
so
much
fuller
of
possibilities
for
intellectual
development
for
all
classes
and
for
happiness
in
life
than
any
other
period
of
which
we
know
this
phase
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
at
once
the
most
interesting
the
most
significant
for
future
generations
and
the
most
important
in
its
lessons
for
all
time
we
have
been
following
up
thus
far
the
exemplification
in
the
thirteenth
century
of
john
ruskin
saying
that
if
you
wish
to
get
at
the
real
significance
of
the
achievements
of
a
period
in
history
you
must
read
the
book
of
its
deeds
the
book
of
its
arts
and
the
book
of
its
words
we
have
been
turning
over
a
few
of
the
pages
of
the
book
of
the
deeds
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
studying
the
history
of
the
establishment
of
the
universities
and
of
the
method
and
content
of
university
teaching
after
all
the
only
deeds
that
ought
to
count
in
the
history
of
mankind
are
those
that
are
done
for
men
that
have
accomplished
something
for
the
uplift
of
mankind
history
is
unfortunately
occupied
with
deeds
of
many
other
kinds
and
it
is
perhaps
the
saddest
blot
on
our
modern
education
that
it
is
mainly
the
history
of
deeds
that
have
been
destructive
of
man
of
human
happiness
and
in
only
too
many
cases
of
human
rights
and
human
liberties
that
are
supposed
to
be
most
worthy
of
the
study
of
the
rising
generation
history
as
written
for
schools
is
to
a
great
extent
a
satire
on
efforts
for
social
progress
we
shall
continue
the
study
of
the
book
of
the
deeds
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
its
most
interesting
and
important
chapter
that
of
the
education
of
the
masses
we
shall
find
in
what
was
accomplished
in
educating
the
people
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
model
of
the
form
of
education
which
in
spite
of
our
does
not
exist
but
must
come
in
our
time
if
our
education
is
to
fulfill
its
real
purpose
perhaps
the
most
interesting
phase
of
this
question
of
the
education
of
the
masses
will
be
the
fact
that
in
studying
this
book
of
the
deeds
we
shall
have
also
to
study
once
more
the
book
of
the
arts
of
the
thirteenth
century
all
their
best
accomplishment
was
linked
with
achievement
and
progress
in
art
yet
it
was
from
the
masses
that
the
large
number
of
of
workmen
with
the
true
artistic
spirit
came
who
in
this
time
in
nearly
every
part
of
europe
created
masterpieces
of
art
in
every
department
which
have
since
been
the
admiration
of
the
world
we
may
say
at
once
that
the
opportunity
for
the
education
of
the
masses
was
furnished
in
connection
with
the
cathedrals
in
the
light
of
what
we
read
in
these
great
stone
books
it
is
a
constant
source
of
surprise
that
the
church
should
be
said
to
have
been
opposed
to
education
reinach
in
his
story
of
art
throughout
the
ages
says
the
church
was
not
only
rich
and
powerful
in
the
middle
ages
it
dominated
and
directed
all
the
manifestations
of
human
activity
there
was
practically
no
art
but
the
art
it
encouraged
the
art
it
needed
to
construct
and
adorn
its
buildings
carve
its
ivories
and
its
reliquaries
and
paint
its
glass
and
its
missals
foremost
among
the
arts
it
fostered
was
architecture
which
never
played
so
important
a
part
in
any
other
society
even
now
when
we
enter
a
romanesque
or
gothic
church
we
are
impressed
by
the
might
of
that
vast
force
of
which
it
is
the
manifestation
a
force
which
shaped
the
destinies
of
europe
for
a
thousand
years
it
was
as
the
result
of
this
demand
for
art
that
the
technical
schools
naturally
developed
around
the
cathedrals
to
take
the
example
of
england
alone
during
the
thirteenth
century
some
twenty
cathedrals
were
erected
in
various
parts
of
the
country
most
of
these
were
built
in
what
we
would
now
call
small
towns
indeed
some
of
them
would
be
considered
scarcely
more
than
villages
there
were
no
large
cities
in
praise
be
it
spoken
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
whole
population
of
england
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
was
scarcely
more
than
two
millions
of
people
and
did
not
reach
three
millions
even
at
the
end
of
it
every
rood
of
ground
did
not
perhaps
maintain
its
man
but
every
part
of
england
had
its
quota
of
population
so
that
there
could
not
be
many
crowded
centers
even
london
probably
at
no
time
during
the
century
had
more
than
thousand
inhabitants
and
oxford
during
the
palmiest
days
of
the
university
was
perhaps
the
most
populous
place
in
the
land
there
was
a
rivalry
in
the
building
of
cathedrals
and
as
the
main
portion
of
the
buildings
were
erected
in
the
short
space
of
a
single
century
a
feeling
of
intense
competition
was
rife
so
that
there
was
very
little
possibility
of
procuring
workmen
from
other
towns
each
town
had
to
create
not
only
its
cathedral
but
the
workmen
who
would
finish
it
in
all
its
details
when
we
consider
that
a
cathedral
like
salisbury
was
practically
completed
in
the
short
space
of
about
years
it
becomes
extremely
difficult
to
understand
just
how
this
little
town
succeeded
in
apparently
accomplishing
the
impossible
it
has
often
been
said
that
artists
can
not
be
obtained
merely
because
of
a
demand
for
them
and
that
they
are
the
slow
creation
of
rather
capricious
nature
it
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
the
artist
is
born
not
made
nature
then
must
have
been
in
a
particularly
fruitful
mood
and
tense
during
the
thirteenth
century
for
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
of
the
wonderful
artistic
beauty
of
the
details
of
these
gothic
cathedrals
while
nature
beneficence
meant
much
however
the
training
of
the
century
probably
meant
even
more
and
the
special
form
of
popular
education
which
developed
well
deserves
the
attention
of
all
other
generations
it
may
be
said
at
once
that
education
in
our
sense
of
teaching
everybody
to
read
and
write
there
was
none
there
were
more
students
at
the
universities
to
the
number
of
the
population
than
in
the
twentieth
century
as
we
have
seen
but
people
who
were
not
to
devote
themselves
in
after
life
to
book
learning
were
not
burdened
with
acquisitions
of
doubtful
benefit
which
might
provide
stores
of
useless
information
for
them
or
enable
them
to
while
away
hours
of
precious
time
reading
trash
or
make
them
conceited
with
the
thought
that
because
they
had
absorbed
some
of
the
opinions
of
others
on
things
in
general
they
had
a
right
to
judge
of
most
things
under
the
sun
and
a
few
other
things
besides
the
circulation
of
our
newspapers
and
the
records
of
the
books
in
demand
at
our
libraries
show
how
much
a
knowledge
of
reading
means
for
most
of
our
population
popular
education
of
this
kind
may
and
does
benefit
a
few
but
it
works
harm
to
a
great
many
of
education
in
the
sense
of
training
the
faculties
so
that
the
individual
might
express
whatever
was
in
him
and
especially
that
he
might
bring
out
what
was
best
in
him
there
was
much
take
again
the
example
of
england
there
was
considerably
less
in
population
than
there
is
in
greater
new
york
at
the
present
time
yet
there
was
some
twenty
places
altogether
in
which
they
were
building
cathedrals
during
this
century
that
would
be
monuments
of
artistic
impulse
and
accomplishment
for
all
future
time
any
city
in
this
country
would
be
proud
to
have
any
one
of
these
english
cathedrals
of
the
thirteenth
century
as
the
expression
of
its
taste
and
power
to
execute
we
have
tried
to
imitate
them
more
or
less
in
many
places
in
order
to
accomplish
our
purpose
in
this
matter
though
we
deliberately
did
everything
on
a
much
smaller
and
less
ambitious
scale
than
the
people
of
the
small
english
towns
of
seven
centuries
ago
and
our
results
do
not
bear
comparison
for
a
moment
with
theirs
we
had
to
appeal
to
other
parts
of
the
country
and
even
to
europe
for
architects
and
designers
and
even
had
to
secure
the
finished
products
of
art
from
distant
places
this
too
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
are
seven
centuries
later
and
that
our
education
is
supposed
to
be
developed
to
a
high
extent
if
there
were
twenty
places
of
instruction
in
greater
new
york
where
architects
and
artist
workers
in
iron
and
glass
and
metal
of
all
kinds
and
wood
and
stone
were
being
trained
to
become
such
finished
artisans
as
were
to
be
found
in
twenty
different
little
towns
of
england
in
the
thirteenth
century
we
should
be
sure
that
our
manual
training
schools
and
our
architectural
departments
of
universities
and
schools
of
design
were
wonderfully
successful
when
we
find
this
to
be
true
of
the
england
of
the
thirteenth
century
we
can
conclude
that
somehow
better
opportunities
for
art
education
must
have
been
supplied
in
those
times
than
in
our
own
and
though
we
do
not
find
the
mention
or
records
of
formal
schools
we
must
look
patiently
for
the
methods
of
instruction
that
enabled
these
generations
to
accomplish
so
much
needless
to
say
such
attainments
do
not
come
spontaneously
in
a
large
number
of
people
but
must
be
carefully
fostered
and
are
the
result
of
that
greatest
factor
in
education
environment
it
will
not
be
hard
to
find
where
the
ambitious
youth
of
england
even
of
the
workman
class
found
opportunities
for
technical
education
of
the
highest
character
in
these
little
towns
this
was
never
merely
theoretic
though
it
was
sufficiently
grounded
in
principle
to
enable
men
to
solve
problems
in
architecture
and
engineering
in
decoration
and
artistic
arrangement
such
as
are
still
sources
of
anxiety
for
modern
students
of
these
questions
to
take
but
a
single
example
it
will
be
readily
appreciated
that
the
consideration
of
the
guilds
of
builders
of
the
cathedrals
as
constituting
a
great
technical
school
is
marvelously
emphasized
by
certain
recent
observations
with
regard
to
architects
and
methods
in
the
cathedrals
there
is
a
passage
in
evelyn
diary
in
which
he
describes
certain
corrections
that
were
introduced
into
old
paul
cathedral
london
the
gothic
edifice
predecessor
of
the
present
classical
structure
in
order
to
remove
appearances
of
dissymmetry
and
certain
seeming
mistakes
of
construction
this
passage
was
always
so
misunderstood
that
editors
usually
considered
it
to
be
defective
in
some
way
and
as
the
classical
critics
always
fall
back
on
an
imperfect
text
for
insoluble
difficulties
so
somehow
evelyn
was
considered
as
either
not
having
understood
what
he
intended
to
say
or
else
the
printer
failed
to
put
in
all
the
words
that
he
wrote
it
was
the
modern
readers
however
not
evelyn
nor
his
printer
who
were
mistaken
goodyear
of
the
brooklyn
institute
of
arts
and
sciences
has
proved
by
a
series
of
photographs
and
carefully
made
observations
that
many
of
the
old
gothic
cathedrals
have
incorporated
into
them
by
their
builders
optical
corrections
which
correspond
to
those
made
by
the
greeks
in
their
building
in
the
classical
period
which
have
been
the
subject
of
so
much
admiration
to
the
moderns
the
medieval
architects
and
builders
knew
nothing
of
these
classical
architectural
refinements
they
learned
for
themselves
by
actual
experience
the
necessity
for
making
such
optical
corrections
and
then
introduced
them
so
carefully
that
it
is
not
until
the
last
decade
or
so
that
their
presence
has
been
realized
it
is
only
by
an
educational
tradition
of
the
greatest
value
that
the
use
of
such
a
refinement
could
become
as
general
as
professor
goodyear
has
found
it
to
be
besides
the
practical
work
then
and
the
actual
exercise
of
craftsmanship
and
of
design
which
the
apprentices
obtained
from
the
guild
there
was
evidently
a
body
of
very
definite
technical
information
conveyed
to
them
or
at
least
to
certain
chosen
spirits
among
them
which
carried
on
precious
traditions
from
place
to
place
this
same
state
of
affairs
must
of
course
have
existed
with
regard
to
stained
glass
work
the
making
of
bells
and
especially
the
finer
work
in
the
precious
metals
practical
metallurgy
must
have
been
studied
quite
as
faithfully
as
in
any
modern
technical
school
at
least
so
far
as
its
practical
purposes
and
application
were
concerned
here
we
have
the
secret
of
the
technical
schools
revealed
it
is
extremely
interesting
to
study
the
details
of
the
very
practical
organization
by
which
this
great
educational
movement
in
the
arts
and
crafts
was
brought
about
it
was
due
entirely
to
the
trades
and
merchants
guilds
of
the
time
in
the
cathedral
towns
the
guilds
preponderated
in
influence
there
gathered
around
each
of
these
cathedrals
during
the
years
when
work
was
most
active
numbers
of
workmen
engaged
at
various
occupations
requiring
mechanical
skill
and
long
practice
at
their
trade
these
workmen
were
all
affiliated
with
one
another
and
they
were
gradually
organized
into
trades
unions
that
had
a
certain
independent
existence
there
was
the
guild
of
the
stone
workers
the
guild
of
the
metal
workers
in
some
places
divided
into
a
guild
of
iron
workers
and
a
guild
of
gold
workers
or
workers
in
precious
metals
there
was
the
guild
of
the
wood
workers
and
then
of
the
various
other
forms
of
occupation
connected
with
the
supplying
of
finished
or
unfinished
materials
for
the
cathedral
in
association
with
these
were
established
guilds
of
tailors
bakers
butchers
all
affiliated
in
a
merchants
guild
which
maintained
the
rights
of
its
members
as
well
as
the
artisans
guilds
some
idea
of
the
number
and
variety
of
these
can
be
obtained
from
the
list
given
in
the
chapter
on
the
origin
of
the
drama
illustration
reliquary
limoges
museo
florence
illustration
crucifix
duomo
siena
these
were
the
workmen
who
not
only
accomplished
such
brilliant
results
in
art
work
but
also
succeeded
in
training
other
workmen
so
admirably
for
every
line
of
artistic
endeavor
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
understand
just
how
a
village
carpenter
did
of
so
exquisite
a
design
and
such
artistic
finish
of
detail
that
it
has
remained
a
subject
of
admiration
for
centuries
it
is
quite
as
difficult
to
understand
how
one
of
the
village
blacksmiths
of
the
time
made
a
handsome
gate
that
has
been
the
constant
admiration
of
posterity
ever
since
or
designed
huge
hinges
for
doors
that
artists
delight
to
copy
or
locks
and
latches
and
bolts
that
are
transported
to
our
museums
to
be
looked
at
with
interest
not
only
because
they
are
antiques
but
for
the
wonderful
combination
of
the
beautiful
and
the
useful
which
they
illustrate
we
are
assured
however
by
the
rev
augustus
jessopp
that
he
has
seen
in
the
archives
of
the
old
english
parishes
some
of
the
receipts
for
the
bills
of
these
village
workmen
as
we
would
term
them
for
the
making
of
these
beautiful
specimens
of
arts
and
crafts
the
surprise
grows
greater
when
we
realize
that
these
beautiful
objects
were
made
not
alone
in
one
place
or
even
in
a
few
places
but
in
nearly
every
town
of
any
size
in
england
and
france
and
italy
and
germany
and
spain
at
various
times
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
that
at
any
time
a
town
of
considerably
less
than
ten
thousand
inhabitants
seemed
to
be
able
to
obtain
among
its
own
inhabitants
men
who
could
make
such
works
of
art
not
as
copies
nor
in
servile
imitation
of
others
but
with
original
ideas
of
their
own
and
make
them
in
such
perfection
that
in
many
cases
they
have
remained
the
models
for
future
workmen
for
many
centuries
even
the
bells
for
the
cathedrals
seem
to
have
been
cast
in
practically
all
cases
in
the
little
town
in
which
they
were
to
be
used
it
may
be
added
that
these
bells
of
the
thirteenth
century
represent
the
highest
advances
in
bell
making
that
have
ever
been
attained
and
that
their
form
and
composition
have
simply
been
imitated
over
and
over
again
since
that
time
even
the
finer
precious
metal
work
such
as
chalices
and
the
various
sacred
vessels
and
objects
used
in
the
church
services
were
not
obtained
from
a
distance
but
were
made
at
home
an
article
that
appeared
a
few
years
ago
in
the
craftsman
syracuse
n
y
a
magazine
published
in
the
interests
of
the
arts
and
crafts
movement
called
attention
to
how
much
more
beautifully
the
thirteenth
century
workman
in
the
precious
metals
accomplished
his
artistic
purpose
than
does
the
corresponding
workman
of
the
present
day
a
definite
comparison
was
made
between
some
typical
chalices
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
some
prize
cups
which
were
made
without
regard
to
cost
as
rewards
for
yachting
and
other
competitions
in
the
twentieth
century
the
artist
workman
of
the
olden
time
knew
how
to
combine
the
beautiful
with
the
useful
to
use
decoration
just
enough
not
to
offend
good
taste
to
make
the
lines
of
his
work
eminently
artistic
and
in
general
to
turn
out
a
fine
work
of
art
the
modern
prize
cup
is
usually
made
by
one
of
the
large
firms
engaged
in
such
work
who
employ
special
designers
for
the
purpose
such
designs
ordinarily
passing
through
the
trained
hands
of
a
series
of
critics
before
being
accepted
and
only
after
this
are
turned
over
to
the
modern
skilled
workmen
to
be
executed
in
metal
all
this
ought
to
assure
the
more
artistic
results
that
they
do
not
according
to
the
writer
in
the
craftsman
demonstrates
how
much
such
success
is
a
matter
of
men
and
of
individual
taste
rather
than
of
method
we
have
already
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
needlework
and
in
other
arts
connected
with
the
provision
of
church
ornaments
and
garments
the
success
of
the
thirteenth
century
workers
was
quite
as
great
the
cope
of
ascoli
considered
by
experts
to
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
bits
of
needlework
ever
made
is
an
example
of
this
many
other
examples
are
to
be
found
in
the
treasuries
of
churches
and
monasteries
in
spite
of
the
ravages
of
time
and
only
too
often
of
intolerant
and
unfortunate
destruction
by
reformers
who
could
see
no
beauty
in
even
the
most
beautiful
things
if
they
ran
counter
to
certain
of
their
religious
prejudices
the
training
necessary
for
the
production
of
such
beautiful
objects
of
handicraftsmanship
was
obtained
through
the
guilds
themselves
the
boy
in
the
small
town
who
thought
that
he
had
a
liking
for
a
certain
trade
or
craft
was
received
as
an
apprentice
in
it
if
during
the
course
of
a
year
or
more
he
demonstrated
his
aptness
for
his
chosen
craft
he
was
allowed
to
continue
his
labor
of
assisting
the
workmen
in
various
ways
and
indeed
very
early
in
the
history
of
the
guilds
was
bound
over
to
some
particular
workman
who
usually
supplied
him
with
board
and
clothing
though
with
no
other
remuneration
during
his
years
of
apprenticeship
after
four
or
five
years
always
however
with
the
understanding
that
he
had
shown
a
definite
talent
for
his
chosen
trade
he
was
accepted
among
the
workmen
of
the
lowest
grade
the
journeymen
who
usually
went
traveling
in
order
to
perfect
their
knowledge
of
the
various
methods
by
which
their
craft
maintained
itself
and
the
standard
of
its
workmanship
in
the
different
parts
of
the
country
during
these
three
years
of
journeying
a
striking
development
was
likely
to
take
place
in
the
mind
of
the
ambitious
young
workman
his
came
just
at
the
most
susceptible
period
sometime
between
and
they
continued
for
three
years
or
more
and
the
young
workman
if
at
all
ambitious
was
likely
to
see
many
men
and
methods
and
know
much
of
the
cities
and
towns
of
his
country
before
he
returned
to
his
native
place
sometimes
these
took
him
even
into
france
where
he
learned
methods
and
secrets
so
different
to
those
at
home
after
these
years
if
he
wished
to
settle
down
in
his
native
town
or
in
some
other
having
brought
evidence
of
the
accomplishment
of
his
apprenticeship
and
then
of
his
years
as
a
journeyman
he
became
an
applicant
for
full
membership
in
the
guild
to
which
his
years
of
training
had
been
devoted
he
was
not
admitted
however
until
he
had
presented
to
the
officials
of
the
organization
a
piece
of
work
showing
his
skill
this
might
be
only
a
hinge
or
a
lock
for
a
door
but
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
a
design
for
an
important
window
or
a
delicate
piece
of
wood
or
if
it
was
considered
worthy
of
the
standard
of
workmanship
of
the
guild
it
was
declared
to
be
a
masterpiece
this
is
where
the
fine
old
english
word
masterpiece
comes
from
the
workman
was
then
admitted
as
a
master
workman
and
became
a
full
member
of
the
guild
this
membership
carried
with
it
a
number
of
other
rights
besides
that
of
permission
to
work
as
a
at
full
wages
whenever
the
guild
was
employed
guilds
had
certain
privileges
conferred
on
them
by
the
towns
in
which
they
lived
by
the
nobles
for
whom
they
worked
and
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
on
whose
various
church
structures
they
were
employed
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
at
least
feudal
ideas
prevailed
to
such
an
extent
that
no
one
was
supposed
to
enjoy
any
rights
or
privileges
except
those
which
had
been
conferred
on
him
by
some
authority
besides
the
workmen
of
the
same
guild
were
bound
together
by
ties
so
that
any
injury
inflicted
on
one
of
them
was
considered
to
be
done
to
the
whole
body
when
human
rights
were
much
less
recognized
than
has
come
to
be
the
case
since
this
constituted
an
important
source
of
protection
against
many
forms
of
injury
and
infringement
of
rights
besides
the
privileges
however
the
guild
possessed
certain
other
decided
advantages
which
made
membership
desirable
even
though
it
involved
the
fulfilment
of
certain
duties
in
the
various
towns
in
england
after
the
introduction
during
the
thirteenth
century
of
the
practice
of
having
mystery
plays
in
the
various
towns
the
guild
claimed
and
obtained
the
privilege
of
giving
these
at
various
times
during
the
year
the
guild
of
the
goldsmiths
would
give
the
performance
of
one
portion
of
the
old
testament
the
guild
of
the
tailors
another
the
guild
of
the
butchers
and
so
on
for
each
of
the
trades
and
crafts
still
another
so
that
during
the
year
a
whole
cycle
of
the
mysteries
of
the
christian
religion
in
type
and
in
reality
were
exhibited
to
the
people
of
each
region
almost
needless
to
say
on
such
festive
occasions
for
the
plays
were
given
on
important
feast
days
the
people
from
the
countryside
flocked
in
to
see
them
and
the
influence
was
widespread
what
was
most
important
however
was
the
influence
on
those
who
took
part
in
the
plays
of
such
intimate
contact
for
a
prolonged
period
with
the
simplicity
of
style
the
sublimity
of
thought
the
concentration
of
purpose
and
the
effectiveness
of
expression
of
the
scriptures
and
the
scripture
narratives
even
in
their
dramatized
form
the
fact
of
actually
taking
part
in
these
performances
meant
ever
so
much
more
than
merely
viewing
them
as
an
outsider
it
is
doubtless
to
this
intimate
relationship
with
the
great
truths
of
christianity
that
the
profound
devotion
so
characteristic
of
the
accomplishments
of
the
arts
and
crafts
during
the
thirteenth
century
must
be
to
no
little
extent

their
beautiful
work
could
only
have
come
from
men
of
profoundest
faith
but
also
it
could
not
have
come
from
those
who
were
ignorant
of
the
basis
of
what
they
accepted
on
faith
in
other
words
there
was
a
mental
training
with
regard
to
some
of
the
sublimest
truths
of
life
and
its
significance
the
creation
of
a
christian
philosophy
of
life
that
made
the
workman
see
clearly
the
great
truths
of
religion
and
so
be
able
to
illustrate
them
by
his
handiwork
education
of
a
higher
order
than
this
has
never
been
conceived
of
and
the
very
lack
of
tedious
formality
in
it
only
made
it
all
the
more
effectual
in
action
other
duties
were
involved
in
membership
in
the
guild
all
the
members
were
bound
to
attend
church
services
regularly
and
to
perform
what
is
known
as
their
religious
duties
at
periodic
intervals
that
is
the
rule
of
the
guild
required
them
to
go
to
mass
on
sundays
and
holy
days
to
abstain
from
manual
labor
on
such
days
unless
there
was
absolute
necessity
for
it
and
to
go
to
confession
and
communion
several
times
a
year
besides
they
were
bound
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
such
of
their
as
were
sick
and
unable
to
work
or
as
had
been
injured
a
very
interesting
phase
of
this
duty
toward
sick
members
existed
at
least
in
some
parts
of
the
country
a
workman
was
supposed
to
pass
one
night
at
certain
intervals
on
his
turn
in
helping
to
nurse
a
who
was
seriously
hurt
or
who
was
very
ill
it
was
considered
that
the
family
were
quite
worn
out
enough
with
the
care
of
the
sick
man
during
the
day
and
so
one
of
his
brother
guildsmen
came
to
relieve
them
of
this
duty
at
night
it
is
a
custom
that
is
still
maintained
in
certain
country
places
but
which
of
course
has
passed
out
of
use
entirely
in
our
unsympathetic
city
life
in
a
word
there
was
a
thorough
education
not
only
in
the
life
work
that
made
for
wages
and
family
support
but
also
in
those
precious
social
duties
that
make
for
happiness
and
contentment

life

on

point

forcing
the

did
so
much
to
awaken
the
enthusiasm
of
christians
for
all
modes
of
religious
development
and
be
it
said
though
credit
for
this
is
only
too
often
refused
them
also
for
educational
charitable
and
social
betterment
the
two
great
church
institutions
of
the
time
that
were
destined
to
act
upon
the
people
more
than
any
others
were
the
franciscan
and
dominican
orders
the
preachers
and
the
friars
minor
who
were
within
a
short
time
after
their
formation
to
have
such
deep
and
widespread
influence
on
all
strata
of
society
both
of
these
orders
from
their
very
birth
showed
themselves
not
only
ready
but
anxious
to
employ
the
arts
as
a
means
of
religious
education
and
for
the
encouragement
of
piety
their
position
in
this
matter
had
an
enormous
influence
on
art
and
on
the
painters
of
the
time
the
dominicans
as
became
their
more
ambitious
intellectual
training
and
their
purpose
as
preachers
of
the
word
demanded
encyclopedic
and
learned
compositions
the
franciscans
asked
for
loving
familiar
scenes
such
as
would
touch
the
hearts
of
the
common
people
both
aided
greatly
in
helping
the
artist
to
break
away
from
the
old
fashioned
formalism
which
was
no
longer
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
new
ardors
of
men
souls
in
this
way
they
prepared
the
italian
imagination
for
the
double
revolution
which
was
to
come
it
was
the
great
body
of
legends
which
grew
up
about
francis
particularly
all
of
them
bound
up
with
supreme
charity
for
neighbor
with
love
for
all
living
creatures
even
the
lowliest
with
the
tenderest
feelings
for
every
aspect
of
external
nature
which
appealed
to
the
painters
as
a
veritable
light
in
the
darkness
of
the
times
it
was
especially
in
the
churches
founded
by
the
disciples
of
the
poor
little
man
of
assisi
that
the
world
saw
burst
forth
before
the
end
of
the
century
the
first
grand
flowers
of
that
renewal
of
art
which
was
to
prove
the
beginning
of
modern
art
history
it
is
hard
to
understand
what
would
have
happened
to
the
painters
of
the
time
without
the
spirit
that
was
brought
into
the
world
by
beautifully
simple
love
for
all
and
every
phase
of
nature
around
him
this
it
was
above
all
that
encouraged
the
return
to
nature
that
soon
supplanted
oriental
formalism
it
was
but
due
compensation
that
the
greatest
works
of
the
early
modern
painters
should
have
been
done
in
francis
honor
besides
this
the
most
important
factor
in
art
was
the
revival
of
the
thirst
for
knowledge
which
arose
among
the
more
intellectual
portions
of
the
communities
and
developed
an
enthusiasm
for
antiquity
which
was
only
a
little
later
to
become
a
veritable
passion
the
most
important
phase
of
italian
art
during
the
thirteenth
century
is
that
which
developed
at
florence
it
is
with
this
that
the
world
is
most
familiar
it
began
with
cimabue
who
commenced
painter
in
the
quaint
old
english
phrase
not
long
before
the
middle
of
the
century
and
whose
great
work
occupies
the
second
half
of
it
there
are
not
wanting
some
interesting
traditions
of
certain
other
florentine
painters
before
his
time
as
marchisello
of
the
early
part
of
the
century
lapo
who
painted
in
the
facade
of
the
cathedral
at
pistoia
and
fino
di
tibaldi
who
painted
a
vast
picture
on
the
walls
of
the
municipal
palace
about
the
middle
of
the
century
but
they
are
so
much
in
the
shadow
of
the
later
masters
work
as
to
be
scarcely
known
everywhere
nature
began
to
reassert
herself
the
workers
in
mosaic
even
who
were
occupied
in
the
famous
baptistry
at
florence
about
the
middle
of
the
century
though
they
followed
the
byzantine
rules
of
their
art
introduced
certain
innovations
which
brought
the
composition
and
the
subjects
closer
to
nature
these
are
enough
to
show
that
there
was
a
school
of
painting
and
decoration
at
florence
quite
sufficient
to
account
for
cimabue
development
without
the
necessity
of
appealing
to
the
influence
over
him
of
wandering
greek
artists
as
has
sometimes
been
done
though
he
was
not
the
absolute
inventor
of
all
the
new
art
modes
as
he
is
sometimes
supposed
to
be
cimabue
was
undoubtedly
a
great
original
genius
like
so
many
others
who
have
been
acclaimed
as
the
very
first
in
a
particular
line
of
thought
or
effort
his
was
only
the
culminating
intelligence
which
grasped
all
that
had
been
done
before
assimilated
it
and
made
it
his
own
as
a
distinct
exception
to
the
usual
history
of
such
great
initiators
this
father
of
italian
painting
was
rich
born
of
a
noble
family
but
of
a
character
that
was
eager
for
work
and
with
ambition
to
succeed
in
his
chosen
art
as
the
mainspring
of
life
at
his
death
as
the
result
of
his
influence
artists
had
acquired
a
much
better
social
position
than
had
been
theirs
before
and
one
that
it
was
comparatively
easy
for
his
successors
to
maintain
his
famous
madonna
which
was
subsequently
borne
in
triumph
from
his
studio
to
the
church
of
santa
maria
novella
placed
the
seal
of
popular
approval
on
the
new
art
and
the
enthusiasm
it
evoked
raised
the
artist
for
all
time
from
the
plane
of
a
mere
worker
in
colors
to
that
of
a
member
of
a
liberal
profession
even
before
this
triumph
his
great
picture
had
been
deemed
worthy
of
a
visit
by
charles
of
anjou
the
french
king
who
was
on
a
visit
to
florence
and
according
to
tradition
ever
afterwards
the
portion
of
the
city
in
which
it
had
been
painted
and
through
which
it
was
carried
in
procession
bore
by
reason
of
these
happy
events
the
name
borgo
allegri
ward
of
joy
this
picture
is
still
in
its
place
in
the
rucellai
chapel
and
is
of
course
the
subject
of
devoted
attention
on
the
part
of
visitors
lafenestre
says
of
it
that
this
monument
of
florentine
art
quite
justifies
the
enthusiasm
of
contemporaries
if
we
compare
it
with
the
expressionless
madonnas
that
preceded
it
there
is
an
air
of
beneficent
dignity
on
the
features
quite
unlike
the
rigidity
of
preceding
art
and
there
is
besides
an
attractive
suppleness
about
the
attitude
of
the
body
which
is
far
better
proportioned
than
those
of
its
predecessors
above
all
there
is
a
certain
roseate
freshness
about
the
colors
of
the
flesh
which
are
pleasant
substitutes
for
the
pale
and
greenish
tints
of
the
byzantines
it
did
not
require
more
than
this
to
exalt
the
imaginations
of
the
people
delivered
from
their
conventional
painting
it
was
only
a
ray
of
the
dawn
after
a
dark
night
but
it
announced
a
glorious
sunrise
of
art
and
the
confident
anticipations
of
the
wondrous
day
to
come
aroused
the
depths
of
feeling
in
the
peoples
hearts
life
and
nature
went
back
into
art
once
more
no
wonder
their
was
saluted
with
so
much
delight
two
other
madonnas
painted
by
him
one
at
florence
in
the
academy
the
other
in
paris
in
the
louvre
besides
his
great
mosaic
in
the
apse
of
the
cathedral
at
pisa
serve
to
show
with
what
prudence
cimabue
introduced
naturalistic
qualities
into
art
while
always
respecting
the
tradition
of
the
older
art
and
preserving
the
solemn
graces
and
the
majestic
style
of
monumental
painting
the
old
frescoes
of
the
upper
church
at
assisi
which
represent
episodes
in
the
life
of
francis
have
also
been
attributed
to
cimabue
but
evidently
were
done
by
a
number
of
artists
probably
under
his
direction
it
is
easy
to
see
from
them
what
an
important
role
the
florentine
artist
played
in
directing
the
gropings
of
his
assistant
artists
after
cimabue
the
most
important
name
at
florentine
in
the
thirteenth
century
is
that
of
his
friend
gaddo
gaddi
whose
years
of
life
correspond
almost
exactly
with
those
of
his
great
contemporary
his
famous
coronation
of
the
virgin
at
santa
maria
de
fiore
in
florence
shows
that
he
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
new
ideas
that
had
come
into
art
greater
than
either
of
these
predecessors
however
was
giotto
the
friend
of
dante
whose
work
is
still
considered
worthy
of
study
by
artists
because
of
certain
qualities
in
which
it
never
has
been
surpassed
nor
quite
outgrown
from
giotto
however
we
shall
turn
aside
for
a
moment
to
say
something
of
the
development
of
art
in
other
cities
of
italy
for
it
must
not
be
thought
that
florence
was
the
only
one
to
take
up
the
new
art
methods
which
developed
so
marvelously
during
the
thirteenth
century
even
before
the
phenomenal
rise
of
modern
art
in
florence
at
pisa
at
lucca
and
especially
at
siena
the
new
wind
of
the
spirit
was
felt
blowing
and
some
fine
inspirations
were
realized
in
spite
of
hampering
difficulties
of
all
kinds
the
madonna
of
guido
in
the
church
of
dominic
at
siena
is
the
proof
of
his
emancipation
besides
him
ugolino
segna
and
duccio
make
up
the
siena
school
and
enable
this
other
tuscan
city
to
dispute
even
with
florence
the
priority
of
the
new
influence
in
art
at
lucca
bonaventure
berlinghieri
flourished
and
there
is
a
famous
francis
by
him
only
recently
found
which
proves
his
right
to
a
place
among
the
great
founders
of
modern
art
giunta
of
pisa
was
one
of
those
called
to
assisi
to
paint
some
of
the
frescoes
in
the
upper
church
he
is
noted
as
having
striven
to
make
his
figures
more
exact
and
his
colors
more
natural
he
did
much
to
help
his
generation
away
from
the
conventional
expressions
of
the
preceding
time
and
he
must
for
this
reason
be
counted
among
the
great
original
geniuses
in
the
history
of
art
the
greatest
name
in
the
art
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
of
course
that
of
giotto
what
dante
did
for
poetry
and
villani
for
history
their
compatriot
and
friend
did
for
painting
ambrogio
de
bondone
familiarly
called
ambrogiotto
and
with
the
abbreviating
habit
that
the
italians
have
always
had
for
the
names
of
all
those
of
whom
they
thought
much
shortened
to
giotto
as
indeed
dante
name
had
been
shortened
from
durante
was
born
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
according
to
a
legend
he
was
guarding
the
sheep
of
his
father
one
day
and
passing
his
time
sketching
a
lamb
upon
a
smooth
stone
with
a
soft
pebble
when
cimabue
happened
to
be
passing
the
painter
struck
by
the
signs
of
genius
in
the
work
took
the
boy
with
him
to
florence
where
he
made
rapid
progress
in
art
and
soon
surpassed
even
his
master
the
wonderful
precocity
of
his
genius
may
be
best
realized
from
the
fact
that
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
was
given
the
commission
of
finishing
the
decorations
of
the
upper
church
at
assisi
and
in
fulfilling
it
broke
so
completely
with
the
byzantine
formalism
of
the
preceding
millennium
that
he
must
be
considered
the
liberator
of
art
and
its
deliverer
from
the
chains
of
conventionalism
into
the
freedom
of
nature
it
is
no
wonder
that
critics
and
literary
men
have
been
so
unstinted
in
his
praise
here
is
an
example
in
the
decamerone
it
is
said
of
him
he
was
so
great
a
genius
that
there
was
nothing
in
nature
he
had
not
so
reproduced
that
it
was
not
only
like
the
thing
but
seemed
to
be
the
thing
itself
eulogies
of
this
tenor
on
works
of
art
are
it
is
quite
true
common
to
all
periods
alike
to
the
most
accomplished
of
classical
antiquity
as
well
as
to
the
most
primitive
of
the
middle
age
and
they
must
only
be
accepted
relatively
according
to
the
notion
entertained
by
each
period
of
what
constitutes
truth
and
naturalness
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
age
giotto
advance
towards
nature
considered
relatively
to
his
predecessors
was
in
truth
enormous
what
he
sought
was
not
merely
the
external
truth
of
sense
but
also
the
inward
truth
of
the
spirit
instead
of
solemn
images
of
devotion
he
painted
pictures
in
which
the
spectator
beheld
the
likeness
of
human
beings
in
the
exercise
of
activity
and
intelligence
his
merit
lies
as
has
been
well
said
in
entirely
new
conception
of
character
and
facts

already
referred
to
says
that
what
has
survived
of
work
justifies
the
enthusiasm
of
his
contemporaries
none
of
his
predecessors
accomplished
anything
like
the
revolution
that
he
worked
he
fixed
the
destinies
of
art
in
italy
at
the
moment
when
dante
fixed
those
of
literature
the
stiff
confused
figures
of
the
mosaics
and
manuscripts
grew
supple
under
his
fingers
and
the
confusion
disappeared
he
simplified
the
gestures
varied
the
expression
rectified
the
proportions
perhaps
the
best
example
of
his
work
is
that
of
the
upper
church
of
assisi
all
accomplished
before
he
was
thirty
what
he
had
to
represent
were
scenes
of
life
almost
contemporary
yet
already
raised
to
the
realm
of
poetry
by
popular
admiration
he
interpreted
the
beautiful
legend
of
the
life
of
the
saint
preserved
by
bonaventure
and
like
the
subject
of
his
sketches
turned
to
nature
at
every
step
of
his
work
if
his
figures
are
compared
with
those
of
the
artists
of
the
preceding
generations
their
truth
to
life
and
natural
expressions
easily
explain
the
surprise
and
the
rapture
of
his
contemporaries
beautiful
as
are
the
pictures
of
the
upper
church
however
ten
years
after
their
completion
giotto
genius
can
be
seen
to
have
taken
a
still
higher
flight
by
the
study
of
the
pictures
on
the
vast
ceilings
of
the
lower
church
the
four
compartments
contain
the
triumph
of
chastity
the
triumph
of
poverty
the
triumph
of
obedience
and
the
glorification
of
francis
the
ideal
and
the
real
figures
in
these
compositions
are
mingled
and
grouped
with
admirable
clearness
and
inventive
force

be
appreciated
properly
they
must
be
seen
and
studied
many
an
artist
has
made
the
pilgrimage
to
assisi
and
none
has
come
away
disappointed
never
before
had
an
artist
dared
to
introduce
so
many
and
such
numerous
figures
yet
all
were
done
with
a
variety
and
an
ease
of
movement
that
is
eminently
pleasing
and
even
now
are
thoroughly
satisfying
to
the
artistic
mind
after
his
work
at
assisi
some
of
the
best
of
giotto
pictures
are
to
be
found
in
the
chapel
of
the
arena
at
padua
here
there
was
a
magnificent
opportunity
and
giotto
took
full
advantage
of
it
the
whole

is
told
in
the
fourteen
episodes
of
the
life
of

sake
padua

giotto
assisi
no
greater
tribute
to
the
century
in
which
he
lived
could
possibly
be
given
than
to
say
that
his
genius
was
recognized
at
once
and
he
was
sought
from
one
end
of
italy
to
another
by
popes
and
kings
republics
and
princes
convents
and
municipalities
all
of
which
competed
for
the
privilege
of
having
this
genius
work
for
them
with
ever
increasing
enthusiasm
it
is
easy
to
think
and
to
say
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
such
a
transcendent
genius
was
recognized
and
appreciated
and
received
his
due
reward
such
has
not
usually
been
the
case
in
history
however
on
the
contrary
the
more
imposing
the
genius
of
an
artist
or
a
scientist
or
any
other
great
innovator
in
things
human
the
more
surely
has
he
been
the
subject
of
neglect
and
even
of
misunderstanding
and
persecution
the
very
fact
that
giotto
lifted
art
out
of
the
routine
of
formalism
in
which
it
was
sunk
might
seem
to
be
enough
to
assure
failure
of
appreciation
men
do
not
suddenly
turn
round
to
like
even
great
innovations
when
they
have
long
been
satisfied
with

of
criticism
have
been
formed
by
their
experience
with
the

need
not
go
farther
back
than
our
own
supposedly
illuminated
nineteenth
century
to
find
some
striking
examples
of
this
turner
the
great
english
landscapist
failed
of
appreciation
for
long
years
and
had
to
wait
till
the
end
of
his
life
to
obtain
even
a
small
meed
of
reward
the
famous
barbizon
school
of
french
painters
is
a
still
more
striking
example
they
went
back
to
nature
from
the
classic
formalism
of
the
early
nineteenth
century

just
as
giotto
went
back
to
nature
from
byzantine
conventionalism

immediate
rewards
in
the
two
cases
were
very
different
and
the
attitude
of
contemporaries
strikingly
contrasted

of
the
fact
that
his
family
nearly
starved
only
that
madame

was

to
take
more
than
a
fair
share
of
hardships
for
herself
and
the
family
in
order
that
her
husband
might
have
the
opportunity
to
develop
his
genius
after
his
own
way
we
might
not
have
had
the
magnificent
pictures
which
millet
sold
for
a
few
paltry
francs
that
barely
kept
the
wolf
from
the
door
and
for
which
the
next
generation
has
been
paying
almost
fabulous
sums
all
through
the
thirteenth
century
this
characteristic
will
be
found
that
genius
did
not
as
a
rule
lack
appreciation
the
greater

genuinely
progressive

to
accomplish

a

the
greatest
compliment
that
could
be
paid
to
the
enlightenment

see
things
differently
from
what
they
had
been
accustomed
to
before
this
constitutes
after
all
the
best
possible
guarantee
of
progress
it
is
however
very
probably
the
last
thing
that
we
would
think
of
attributing
to
these
generations
of
the
thirteenth
century
who
are
usually
said
very
frankly
to
have
been
wrapped
up
in
their
own
notions
to
have
been
only
too
ready
to
accept
things
on
authority
rather
than
by
their
own
powers
of
observation
and
judgment
and
to
have
been
clingers
to
the
past
rather
than

the
art
of
the
middle
ages
and
especially
at
the
time
of
the
beginnings
of
modern
art
in
the
thirteenth
century
is
commonly
supposed
to
be
inextricably
bound
up
with
certain
influences
which
place
it
beyond
the
pale
of
imitation
for
modern
life
it
has
frequently
been
said
that
this
art
besides
being
too
deeply
mystical
and
pietistic
is
so
remote
from
ordinary
human
feelings
as
to
preclude
a
proper
understanding
of
it
by
the
men
of
our
time
and
certainly
prevent
any
deep
sympathy
the
pagan
element
in
art
which
entered
at
the
time
of
the
renaissance
and
which
emphasized
the
joy
of
life
itself
and
the
pleasure
of
mere
living
for
its
own
sake
is
supposed
to
have
modified
this
sadder
aspect
of
things
in
the
earlier
art
so
that
now
no
one
would
care
to
go
back
to
the
day
there
has
been
so
much
writing
of
this
kind
that
has
carried
weight
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
impression
has
been
deeply
made
it
is
founded
almost
entirely
on
a
misunderstanding
however
reinach
whom
we
have
quoted
before
completely
overturns
this
false
notion
in
some
paragraphs
which
bring
out
better
than
any
others
that
we
know
something
of
the
true
significance
of
the
thirteenth
century
art
in
this
particular
those
who
think
that
gothic
art
was
mainly
gloomy
in
character
or
if
not
absolutely
sad
at
heart
that
it
always
expressed
the
sadder
portion
of
religious
feelings
who
consider
that
the
ascetic
side
of
life
was
always
in
the
ascendant
and
the
brighter
side
of
things
seldom
chosen
for
pictorial
purposes
should
recall
that
the
gothic
cathedrals
themselves
are
the
most
cheery
and
lightsome
buildings
that
indeed
they
owe
their
character
as
creations
of
a
new
idea
in
architecture
to
the
determined
purpose
of
their
builders
to
get
admission
for
all
possible
light
in
the
dreary
northern
climates
the
contradiction
of
the
idea
that
gothic
art
in
its
essence
was
gloomy
will
at
once
be
manifest
from
this
quite
apart
from
this
however
if
gothic
art
be
studied
for
itself
and
in
its
subjects
that
of
the
thirteenth
century
particularly
will
be
found
far
distant
from
anything
that
would
justify
the
criticism
of
over
sadness
reinach
in
his
story
of
art
throughout
the
middle
ages
has
stated
this
so
clearly
that
we
prefer
simply
to
quote
the
passage
which
is
at
once
authoritative
and
informing
it
has
also
been
said
that
gothic
art
bears
the
impress
of
ardent
piety
and
emotional
mysticism
that
it
dwells
on
the
suffering
of
jesus
of
the
virgin
and
of
the
martyrs
with
harrowing
persistency
those
who
believe
this
have
never
studied
gothic
art
it
is
so
far
from
the
truth
that
as
a
fact
the
gothic
art
of
the
best
period
the
thirteenth
century
never
represented
any
sufferings
save
those
of
the
damned
the
virgins
are
smiling
and
gracious
never
grief
stricken
there
is
not
a
single
gothic
rendering
of
the
virgin
weeping
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
the
words
and
music
of
the

are
sometimes
instanced
as

highest
expression
of
the
religion
of
the
middle
ages
date
from
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
at
the
very
earliest
and
did
not
become
popular
till
the
fifteenth
century
jesus
himself
is
not
represented
as
suffering
but
with
a
serene
and
majestic
expression

libraries
and

as
the
thirteenth
century
begins
some
years
before
the
art
of
printing
was
introduced
it
would
seem
idle
to
talk
of
libraries
and
especially
of
circulating
libraries
during
this
period
and
quite
as
futile
to
talk
of
bookmen
and
book
collectors
any
such
false
impression
however
is
founded
entirely
upon
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
during
this
wonderful
period
a
diocesan
council
held
in
paris
in
the
year
with
other
words
of
advice
to
religious
recalled
to
them
the
duty
that
they
had
to
lend
such
books
as
they
might
possess
with
proper
guarantee
for
their
return
of
course
to
those
who
might
make
good
use
of
them
the
council
indeed
formally
declared
that
the
lending
of
books
was
one
of
the
works
of
mercy
the
cathedral
chapter
of
notre
dame
at
paris
was
one
of
the
leaders
in
this
matter
and
there
are
records
of
their
having
lent
many
books
during
the
thirteenth
century
at
most
of
the
abbeys
around
paris
there
were
considerable
libraries
and
in
them
also
the
lending
custom
obtained
this
is
especially
true
of
the
abbey
of
victor
of
which
the
rule
and
records
are
extant
of
course
it
will
be
realized
that
the
number
of
books
was
not
large
but
on
the
other
hand
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
many
of
them
were
works
of
art
in
every
particular
and
some
of
them
that
have
come
down
to
us
continue
to
be
even
to
the
present
day
among
the
most
precious
bibliophilic
treasures
of
great
state
and
city
libraries
their
value
depends
not
alone
on
their
antiquity
but
on
their
perfection
as
works
of
art
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
the
missals
and
office
books
and
the
prayer
books
made
for
royal
personages
and
the
nobility
at
this
time
are
yet
counted
among
the
best
examples
of
bookmaking
the
world
has
ever
seen
it
is
not
surprising
that
such
should
be
the
case
since
these
books
were
mainly
meant
for
use
in
the
cathedrals
and
the
chapels
and
these
edifices
were
so
beautiful
in
every
detail
that
the
generations
that
erected
them
could
not
think
of
making
books
for
use
in
them
that
would
be
unworthy
of
the
artistic
environment
for
which
they
were
intended
with
the
candlesticks
the
vessels
and
implements
used
in
the
ceremonial
surpassing
works
of
art
with
every
form
of
decoration
so
nearly
perfect
as
to
be
a
source
of
unending
admiration
with
the
vestments
and
altar
linens
specimens
of
the
most
exquisite
handiwork
of
their
kind
that
had
ever
been
made
the
books
associated
with
them
had
to
be
excellent
in
execution
expressive
of
the
most
refined
taste
and
finished
with
an
attention
utterly
careless
of
the
time
and
labor
that
might
be
required
since
the
sole
object
was
to
make
everything
as
absolutely
beautiful
as
possible
hence
there
is
no
dearth
of
wonderful
examples
of
the
beautiful
bookmaking
of
this
century
in
all
the
great
libraries
of
the
world
the
libraries
themselves
moreover
are
of
surpassing
interest
because
of
their
rules
and
management
for
little
as
it
might
be
expected
this
wonderful
century
anticipated
in
these
matters
most
of
our
very
modern
library
regulations
the
bookmen
of
the
time
not
only
made
beautiful
books
but
they
made
every
provision
to
secure
their
free
circulation
and
to
make
them
available
to
as
many
people
as
was
consonant
with
proper
care
of
the
books
and
the
true
purposes
of
libraries
this
is
a
chapter
of
thirteenth
century
history
more
ignored
perhaps
than
any
other
but
which
deserves
to
be
known
and
will
appeal
to
our
century
more
perhaps
than
to
any
intervening
period
the
constitutions
of
the
abbey
victor
of
paris
give
us
an
excellent
idea
at
once
of
the
solicitude
with
which
the
books
were
guarded
yet
also
of
the
careful
effort
that
was
made
to
render
them
useful
to
as
many
persons
as
possible
one
of
the
most
important
rules
at
victor
was
that
the
librarian
should
know
the
contents
of
every
volume
in
the
library
in
order
to
be
able
to
direct
those
who
might
wish
to
consult
the
books
in
their
selection
and
while
thus
sparing
the
books
unnecessary
handling
also
save
the
readers
precious
time
we
are
apt
to
think
that
it
is
only
in
very
modern
times
that
this
training
of
librarians
to
know
their
books
so
as
to
be
of
help
to
the
readers
was
insisted
on
here
however
we
find
it
in
full
force
seven
centuries
ago
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
in
the
present
day
to
know
all
the
books
confided
to
his
care
but
some
of
the
librarians
at
victor
were
noted
for
the
perfection
of
their
knowledge
in
this
regard
and
were
often
consulted
by
those
who
were
interested
in
various
subjects
in
his
book
on
the
thirteenth
century
footnote
lecoy
de

says
that
in
france
at
least
circulating
libraries
were
quite
common
as
might
be
expected
of
the
people
of
so
practical
a
century
it
was
they
who
first
established
the
rule
that
a
book
might
be
taken
out
provided
its
value
were
deposited
by
the
borrower
such
lending
libraries
were
to
be
found
at
the
sorbonne
at
germain
des
prés
as
well
as
at
notre
dame
there
was
also
a
famous
library
at
this
time
at
corbie
but
practically
every
one
of
the
large
abbeys
had
a
library
from
which
books
could
be
obtained
certain
of
the
castles
of
the
nobility
as
for
instance
that
of
la
ferte
en
ponthieu
had
libraries
with
regard
to
which
there
is
a
record
that
the
librarian
had
the
custom
of
lending
certain
volumes
provided
the
person
was
known
to
him
and
assumed
responsibility
for
the

some
of
the
regulations
of
the
libraries
of
the
century
have
an
interest
all
their
own
from
the
exact
care
that
was
required
with
regard
to
the
books
the
sorbonne
for
instance
by
rule
inflicted
a
fine
upon
anyone
who
neglected
to
close
large
volumes
after
he
had
been
making
use
of
them
many
a
librarian
of
the
modern
times
would
be
glad
to
put
into
effect
such
a
regulation
as
this
a
severe
fine
was
inflicted
upon
any
library
assistant
who
allowed
a
stranger
to
go
into
the
library
alone
and
another
for
anyone
who
did
not
take
care
to
close
the
doors
it
seems
not
unlikely
that
these
regulations
as
lecoy
de
la
marche
says
were
in
vigor
in
many
of
the
ecclesiastical
and
secular
libraries
of
the
time
some
of
the
regulations
of
victor
are
quite
as
interesting
and
show
the
liberal
spirit
of
the
time
as
well
as
indicate
how
completely
what
is
most
modern
in
library
management
was
anticipated
the
librarian
had
the
charge
of
all
the
books
of
the
community
was
required
to
have
a
detailed
list
of
them
and
each
year
to
have
them
in
his
possession
at
least
three
times
on
him
was
placed
the
obligation
to
see
that
the
books
were
not
destroyed
in
any
way
either
by
parasites
of
any
kind
or
by
dampness
the
librarian
was
required
to
arrange
the
books
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
the
finding
of
them
prompt
and
easy
no
book
was
allowed
to
be
borrowed
unless
some
pledge
for
its
safe
return
were
left
with
the
librarian
this
was
emphasized
particularly
for
strangers
who
must
give
a
pledge
equal
to
the
value
of
the
book
in
all
cases
however
the
name
of
the
borrower
had
to
be
taken
also
the
title
of
the
book
borrowed
and
the
kind
of
pledge
left
the
larger
and
more
precious
books
could
not
be
borrowed
without
the
special
permission
of
the
superior
the
origin
of
the
various
libraries
in
paris
is
very
interesting
as
proof
that
the
mode
of
accumulating
books
was
nearly
the
same
as
that
which
enriches
university
and
other
such
libraries
at
the
present
time
the
library
of
la
chapelle
was
founded
by
louis
ix
and
being
continuously
enriched
by
the
deposit
therein
of
the
archives
of
the
kingdom
soon
became
of
first
importance
many
precious
volumes
that
were
given
as
presents
to
louis
found
their
way
into
this
library
and
made
it
during
his
lifetime
the
most
valuable
collection
of
books
in
paris
louis
moreover
devoted
much
time
and
money
to
adding
to
the
library
he
made
it
a
point
whenever
on
his
journeys
he
stopped
at
abbeys
or
other
ecclesiastical
institutions
to
find
out
what
books
were
in
their
library
that
were
not
at

had

of
these

with
robert

with

with
saint
bonaventure
and
above
all
with
vincent
of
beauvais
the
famous
encyclopedist
of
the
century
widened
his
interest
in
books
and
must
have
made
him
an
excellent
judge
of
what
he
ought
to
procure
to
complete
the
library
it
was
as
we
shall
see
louis
munificent
patronage
that
enabled
vincent
to
accumulate
that
precious
store
of
medieval
knowledge
which
was
to
prove
a
mine
of
information
for
so
many
subsequent
generations
from
the
earliest
times
certain
books
mainly
on
medicine
were
collected
at
the
hotel

the
great
hospital
of
paris
and
this
collection
was
added
to
from
time
to
time
by
the
bequests
of
physicians
in
attendance
there
this
was
doubtless
the
first
regular
hospital
library
though
probably
medical
books
had
also
been
collected
at
salernum
the
principal
colleges
of
the
universities
also
made
collections
of
books
some
of
them
very
valuable
though
as
a
rule
it
would
seem
as
if
no
attempt
was
made
to
procure
any
other
books
than
those
which
were
absolutely
needed
for
consultation
by
the
students
the
best
working
library
at
paris
was
undoubtedly
that
of
the
sorbonne
of
which
indeed
its
books
were
for
a
long
time
its
only
treasures
for
at
first
the
sorbonne
was
nothing
but
a
teaching
institution
which
only
required
rooms
for
its
lectures
and
usually
obtained
these
either
from
the
university
authorities
or
from
the
canons
of
the
cathedral
and
possessed
no
property
except
its
library
from
the
very
beginning
the
professors
bequeathed
whatever
books
they
had
collected
to
its
library
and
this
became
a
custom
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
within
a
very
short
time
the
library
became
one
of
the
very
best
in
europe
while
most
of
the
other
libraries
were
devoted
mainly
to
sacred
literature
the
sorbonne
came
to
possess
a
large
number
of
works
of
profane
literature
interesting
details
with
regard
to
this
library
of
the
sorbonne
and
its
precious
treasures
have
been
given
by
leopold
delisle
in
the
second
volume
of
le
cabinet
des
manuserits
describing
the
mss
of
the
bibliothèque
nationale
at
paris
according
to
lecoy
de
la
marche
this
gives
an
excellent
idea
of
the
persevering
efforts
which
must
have
been
required
to
bring
together
so
many
bibliographic
treasures
at
a
time
when
books
were
such
a
rarity
and
consequently
enables
us
better
almost
than
anything
else
to
appreciate
the
enthusiasm
of
the
scholars
of
these
early
times
and
their
wonderful
efforts
to
make
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
easier
not
only
for
their
own
but
for
succeeding
generations
when
we
recall
that
the
library
of
the
sorbonne
was
during
the
thirteenth
century
open
not
only
to
the
professors
and
students
of
the
sorbonne
itself
but
also
to
those
interested
in
books
and
in
literature
who
might
come
from
elsewhere
provided
they
were
properly
accredited
we
can
realize
to
the
full
the
thorough
liberality
of
spirit
of
these
early
scholars
usually
we
are
prone
to
consider
that
this
liberality
of
spirit
even
in
educational
matters
came
much
later
into
the
world
in
spite
of
the
regulations
demanding
the
greatest
care
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
after
a
time
even
books
written
on
vellum
or
parchment
would
become
disfigured
and
worn
under
the
ardent
fingers
of
enthusiastic
students
when
comparatively
so
few
copies
were
available
for
general
use
in
order
to
replace
these
copies
every
abbey
had
its
own
scriptorium
or
writing
room
where
especially
the
younger
monks
who
were
gifted
with
plain
handwriting
were
required
to
devote
certain
hours
every
day
to
the
copying
of
manuscripts
manuscripts
were
borrowed
from
neighboring
libraries
and
copied
or
as
in
our
modern
day
exchanges
of
duplicate
copies
were
made
so
as
to
avoid
the
risk
that
precious
manuscripts
might
be
subject
to
on
the
journeys
from
one
abbey
to
another
how
much
the
duty
of
transcription
was
valued
may
be
appreciated
from
the
fact
that
in
some
abbeys
every
novice
was
expected
to
bring
on
the
day
of
his
profession
as
a
religious
a
volume
of
considerable
size
which
had
been
carefully
copied
by
his
own
hands
besides
these
methods
of
increasing
the
number
of
books
in
the
library
a
special
sum
of
money
was
set
aside
in
most
of
the
abbeys
for
the
procuring
of
additional
volumes
for
the
library
by
purchase
usually
this
took
the
form
of
an
ecclesiastical
regulation
requiring
that
a
certain
percentage
of
the
revenues
should
be
spent
on
the
libraries
scholars
closely
associated
with
monasteries
frequently
bequeathed
their
books
and
besides
left
money
or
incomes
to
be
especially
devoted
to
the
improvement
of
the
library
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
with
all
these
sources
of
enrichment
many
abbeys
possessed
noteworthy
libraries
to
quote
only
those
of
france
important
collections
of
books
were
to
be
found
at
cluny

where
vincent
de
beauvais
said
that
he
found
the
greatest
collections
of
manuscripts
that
existed
in
his
time
and
then
especially
the
great
parisian
abbeys
already
referred
to
saint
victor
the
precious
treasures
of
which
are
well
known
to
all
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
bibliothèque
nationale
of
paris
of
whose
manuscript
department
their
relics
constitute
the
most
valuable
nucleus
some
of
the
bequests
of
books
that
were
made
to
libraries
at
this
time
are
interesting
because
they
show
the
spirit
of
the
testators
and
at
the
same
time
furnish
valuable
hints
as
to
the
consideration
in
which
books
were
held
and
the
reverent
care
of
their
possessors
for
them
peter
of
nemours
the
bishop
of
paris
when
setting
out
on
the
crusades
with
louis
ix
bequeathed
to
the
famous
abbey
of
victor
his
bible
in
volumes
which
was
considered
one
of
the
finest
copies
of
the
scriptures
at
that
time
in
existence
to
the
abbey
of
olivet
he
gave
his
psalter
with
glosses
besides
the
epistles
of
paul
and
his
book
of
sentences
by
which
is
evidently
intended
the
work
with
that
title
by
the
famous
peter
lombard
finally
he
gave
to
the
cathedral
of
paris
all
the
rest
of
his
books
besides
these
he
had
very
little
to
leave
it
is
typical
of
the
reputation
of
paris
in
that
century
and
the
devotion
of
her
churchmen
to
learning
and
culture
that
practically
all
of
the
revenues
that
he
considered
due
him
for
his
personal
services
had
been
invested
in
books
which
he
then
disposed
of
in
such
a
way
as
would
secure
their
doing
the
greatest
possible
good
to
the
largest
number
of
people
his
bible
was
evidently
given
to
the
abbey
of
victor
because
it
was
the
sort
of
work
that
should
be
kept
for
the
occasional
reference
of
the
learned
rather
than
the
frequent
consultation
of
students
who
might
very
well
find
all
that
they
desired
in
other
and
less
valuable
copies
his
practical
intention
with
regard
to
his
books
can
be
best
judged
from
his
gift
to
notre
dame
which
as
we
have
noted
already
possessed
a
very
valuable
library
that
was
allowed
to
circulate
among
properly
accredited
scholars
in
paris
according
to
the
will
of
peter
ameil
archbishop
of
narbonne
which
is
dated
he
gave
his
books
for
the
use
of
the
scholars
whom
he
had
supported
at
the
university
of
paris
and
they
were
to
be
deposited
in
the
library
at
notre
dame
but
on
condition
that
they
were
not
to
be
scattered
for
any
reason
nor
any
of
them
sold
or
abused
the
effort
of
the
booklover
to
keep
his
books
together
is
characteristic
of
all
the
centuries
since
only
most
people
will
be
surprised
to
find
it
manifesting
itself
so
early
in
bibliophilic
history
the
archbishop
reserved
from
his
books
however
his
bible
for
his
own
church
before
his
death
he
had
given
the
dominicans
in
his
diocese
many
books
from
his
library
this
churchman
of
the
first
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
seems
evidently
to
deserve
a
prominent
place
among
the
bookmen
of
all
times
there
are
records
of
many
others
who
bequeathed
libraries
and
gave
books
during
their
lifetime
to
various
institutions
as
may
be
found
in
the
literary
history
of
france
footnote
already
mentioned
as
well
as
in
the
various
histories
of
the
university
of
paris
many
of
these
gifts
were
made
on
condition
that
they
should
not
be
sold
and
the
constantly
recurring
condition
made
by
these
booklovers
is
that
their
collections
should
be
kept
together
the
libraries
of
paris
were
also
in
the
market
for
books
however
and
there
is
proof
that
the
sorbonne
purchased
a
number
of
volumes
because
the
cost
price
of
them
was
noted
inside
the
cover
quite
as
libraries
do
in
our
own
days
when
we
realize
the
forbidding
cost
of
them
it
is
surprising
that
there
should
be
so
much
to
say
about
them
and
so
many
of
them
constantly
changing
hands
an
ordinary
folio
volume
probably
cost
from
to
francs
in
our
values
that
is
between

while
the
older

of

earlier
religious
orders
possessed
magnificent
collections
of
books
the
newer

of
the
thirteenth
century
the
mendicants
though
as
their
name
indicates
they
were
bound
to
live
by
alms
given
them
by
the
faithful
within
a
short
time
after
their
foundation
began
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
the
library
movement
it
was
in
the
southern
part
of
france
that
the
dominicans
were
strongest
and
so
there
is
record
of
regulations
for
libraries
made
at
toulouse
in
the
early
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
paris
in
considerable
time
and
discussion
was
devoted
in
one
of
the
chapters
of
the
order
to
the
question
of
how
books
should
be
kept
and
how
the
library
should
be
increased
with
regard
to
the
franciscans
though
their
poverty
was
if
possible
stricter
the
same
thing
is
known
before
the
end
of
the
century
in
both
orders
arrangements
were
made
for
the
copying
of
important
works
and
it
is
of
course
to
the
zeal
and
enthusiasm
of
the
younger
members
of
these
orders
for
this
copying
work
that
we
owe
the
preservation
by
means
of
a
large
number
of
manuscript
copies
of
the
voluminous
writings
of
such
men
as
albertus

while
the
existence
of

of

kinds
and
even
circulating

in

thirteenth
century
may
seem
definitely
settled
it
will
appear
to
most
people
that
to
speak
of
book
collecting
at
this
time
must
be
out
of
place
that
fad
is
usually
presumed
to
be
of
much
later
origin
and
indeed
to
be
comparatively
recent
in
its
manifestations
we
have
said
enough
already
however
of
the
various
collections
of
books
in
libraries
especially
in
france
to
show
that
the
book
collector
was
abroad
but
there
is
much
more
direct
evidence
of
this
available
from
an
english
writer
richard
de
philobiblon
is
very
well
known
to
all
who
are
interested
in
books
for
their
own
sake
but
few
people
realize
that
this
book
practically
had
its
origin
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
writer
was
born
about
the
beginning
of
the
last
quarter
of
that
century
had
completed
his
education
before
its
close
and
it
is
only
reasonable
to
attribute
to
the
formative
influences
at
work
in
his
intellectual
development
as
a
young
man
the
germs
of
thought
from
which
were
to
come
in
later
life
the
interesting
book
on
bibliophily
the
first
of
its
kind
which
was
to
be
a
treasure
for
ever
afterwards
philobiblon
tells
us
among
other
things
of
richard
visits
to
the
continent
on
an
embassy
to
the
holy
see
and
on
subsequent
occasions
to
the
court
of
france
and
the
delight
which
he
experienced
in
handling
many
books
which
he
had
never
seen
before
in
buying
such
of
them
as
his
purse
would
allow
or
his
enthusiasm
could
tempt
from
their
owners
and
in
conversing
with
those
who
could
tell
him
about
books
and
their
contents
such
men
were
the
chosen
comrades
of
his
journeys
sat
with
him
at
table
as
henry
morley
tells
us
in
his
english
writers
volume
iv
page
and
were
in
almost
constant
fellowship
with
him
it
was
at
paris
particularly
that
richard
heart
was
satisfied
for
a
time
because
of
the
great
treasures
he
found
in
the
magnificent
libraries
of
that
city
he
was
interested
of
course
in
the
university
and
the
opportunity
for
intellectual
employment
afforded
by
academic
proceedings
but
above
all
he
found
delight
in
books
which
monks
and
monarchs
and
professors
and
churchmen
of
all
kinds
and
scholars
and
students
had
gathered
into
this
great
intellectual
capital
of
europe
at
that
time
anyone
who
thinks
the
books
were
not
valued
quite
as
highly
in
the
thirteenth
century
as
at
the
present
time
should
read
the
philobiblon
he
is
apt
to
rise
from
the
reading
of
it
with
the
thought
that
it
is
the
modern
generations
who
do
not
properly
appreciate
books
one
of
the
early
chapters
of
philobiblon
argues
that
books
ought
always
to
be
bought
whatever
they
cost
provided
there
are
means
to
pay
for
them
except
in
two
cases
when
they
are
knavishly
overcharged
or
when
a
better
time
for
buying
is
expected
that
sun
of
men
solomon
richard
says
bids
us
buy
books
readily
and
sell
them
unwillingly
for
one
of
his
proverbs
runs
the
truth
and
sell
it
not
also
wisdom
and
instruction
and
understanding
richard
in
his
own
quaint
way
thought
that
most
other
interests
in
life
were
only
temptations
men
away
from
books
in
one
famous
paragraph
he
has
naively
personified
books
as
complaining
with
regard
to
the
lack
of
attention
men
now
display
for
them
and
the
unworthy
objects
in
richard
eyes
at
least
upon
which
they
fasten
their
affections
instead
and
which
take
them
away
from
the
only
great
life
interest
that
is
really
worth
while
books
yet
complain
books
in
these
evil
times
we
are
cast
out
of
our
place
in
the
inner
chamber
turned
out

our
place
taken

the

that
beast
has
always

our
rival

when
she
spies
us
in

corner
with
no
better
protection
than
the
web
of
a
dead
spider
she
drags
us
out
with
a
frown
and
violent
speech
laughing
us
to
scorn
as
useless
and
soon
counsels
us
to
be
changed
into
costly
fine
linen
silk
and
scarlet
double
dyed
dresses
and
divers
trimmings
linens
and
woolens

so
complain

ragged

a
dunghill

as
seems
hardly
fit
to
be
said
we
are
hidden
in
abysses
of
the
sewers

are
sold
also
like

unredeemed

we
always
dread

some
of
our

are
known
to
have
been
poisoned
richard
de
bury
must
not
be
thought
to
have
been
some
mere
wandering
scholar
of
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
however
for
he
was
perhaps
the
most
important
historical
personage
not
even
excepting
royalty
or
nobility
of
this
era
and
one
of
the
striking
examples
of
how
high
a
mere
scholar
might
rise
in
this
period
quite
apart
from
any
achievement
in
arms
though
this
is
usually
supposed
to
be
almost
the
only
basis
of
distinguished
reputation
and
the
reason
for
advancement
at
this
time
while
he
was
only
the
son
of
a
norman
knight
aungervyle
by
name
born
at
bury
edmund
he
became
the
steward
of
the
palace
and
treasurer
of
the
royal
wardrobe
then
lord
treasurer
of
england
and
finally
lord
keeper
of
the
privy
seal
while
on
a
mission
to
the
pope
he
so
commended
himself
to
the
holy
see
that
it
was
resolved
to
make
him
the
next
english
bishop
accordingly
he
was
made
bishop
of
durham
shortly
after
and
on
the
occasion
of
his
installation
there
was
a
great
banquet
at
which
the
young
king
and
queen
the
queen
mother
isabelle
the
king
of
scotland
two
archbishops
five
bishops
and
most
of
the
great
english
lords
were
present
at
this
time
the
scots
and
the
english
were
actually
engaged
in
war
with
one
another
and
a
special
truce
was
declared
in
order
to
allow
them
to
join
in
the
celebration
of
the
consecration
of
so
distinguished
an
individual
to
the
see
of
durham
near
the
frontier
before
he
was
consecrated
bishop
richard
de
bury
had
been
for
some
time
the
treasurer
of
the
kingdom
before
the
end
of
the
year
in
which
he
was
consecrated
he
became
lord
chancellor
at
a
time
when
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
needed
a
master
hand
and
when
the
french
and
the
scots
were
seriously
disturbing
english
peace
and
prosperity
he
resigned
his
office
of
chancellor
as
henry
morley
states
only
to
go
abroad
in
the
royal
service
as
ambassador
that
he
might
exercise
his
own
trusted
sagacity
in
carrying
out
the
peaceful
policy
he
had
advised
during
this
diplomatic
mission
to
the
continent
he
visited
the
courts
of
paris
of
flanders
of
hainault
and
of
germany
he
succeeded
in
making
terms
of
peace
between
the
english
king
and
the
counts
of
hainault
and
namur
the
marquis
of
juliers
and
the
dukes
of
brabant
and
guelders
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
he
must
be
considered
as
one
of
the
most
prominent
men
of
europe
at
this
time
his
attitude
toward
books
is
then
all
the
more
noteworthy
many
people
were
surprised
that
a
great
statesman
like
gladstone
in
the
nineteenth
century
should
have
been
interested
in
so
many
phases
of
thought
and
of
literature
and
should
himself
have
been
able
to
find
the
time
to
contribute
important
works
to
english
letters
richard
de
bury
was
at
least
as
important
a
man
in
his
time
as
gladstone
in
ours
and
occupied
himself
as
much
with
books
as
the
great
english
commoner
this
is
what
will
be
the
greatest
source
of
surprise
to
those
who
in
our
time
have
been
accustomed
to
think
that
the
great
scholars
deeply
interested
in
books
who
were
yet
men
of
practical
worth
in
helping
their
generation
in
its
great
problems
are
limited
to
modern
times
and
are
least
of
all
likely
to
be
found
in
the
heart
of
the
middle
ages
in
spite
of
his
occupations
as
a
politician
and
a
bookman
richard
de
bury
was
noted
for
his
faithfulness
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
duties
as
a
churchman
and
a
bishop
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
many
of
the
important
clergymen
of
england
who
were
to
find
the
highest
church
preferment
afterwards
were
among
the
members
of
his
household
at
various
times
and
that
the
post
of
secretary
to
the
bishop
particularly
was
filled
at
various
times
by
some
of
the
best
scholars
of
the
period
men
who
were
devoted
friends
to
the
bishop
who
dedicated
their
works
to
him
and
generally
added
to
the
reputation
that
stamped
him
as
the
greatest
scholar
of
england
and
one
of
the
leading
lights
of
european
culture
of
his
time
this
is
not
so
surprising
when
we
realize
that
to
be
a
member
of
richard
household
was
to
have
access
to
the
best
library
in
england
and
that
many
scholars
were
naturally
ambitious
to
have
such
an
opportunity
and
as
the
results
showed
many
took
advantage
of
it
among
richard
of
durham
chaplains
were
thomas
bradwardine
who
afterwards
became
archbishop
of
canterbury
richard
fitzraufe
subsequently
archbishop
of
armagh
walter
seagrave
afterwards
bishop
of
chichester
and
richard
bentworth
who
afterwards
became
bishop
of
london
among
the
distinguished
scholars
who
occupied
the
post
were
robert
holcot
john
manduit
the
astronomer
of
the
fourteenth
century
richard
kilmington
a
distinguished
english
theologian
and
walter
burley
a
great
commentator
on
aristotle
who
dedicated
to
the
bishop
who
had
provided
him
with
so
many
opportunities
for
study
his
commentaries
upon
the
politics
and
ethics
of
the
ancient
greek
philosopher
that
richard
love
for
books
and
the
time
he
had
necessarily
devoted
to
politics
did
not
dry
up
the
fountains
of
charity
in
his
heart
nor
cause
him
to
neglect
his
important
duties
as
the
pastor
of
the
people
and
especially
of
the
poor
we
know
very
well
from
certain
traditions
with
regard
to
his
charitable
donations
according
to
a
standing
rule
in
his
household
eight
quarters
of
wheat
were
regularly
every
week
made
into
bread
and
given
to
the
poor
in
his
alms
giving
richard
was
as
careful
and
as
discriminating
as
in
his
collection
of
books
and
he
used
a
number
of
the
regularly
organized
channels
in
his
diocese
to
make
sure
that
his
bounty
should
be
really
helpful
and
should
not
encourage
lack
of
thrift
this
is
a
feature
of
charitable
work
that
is
supposed
to
be
modern
but
the
personal
service
of
the
charitably
inclined
in
the
thirteenth
century
far
surpassed
in
securing
this
even
the
elaborate
organization
of
charity
in
modern
times
whenever
the
bishop
traveled
generous
alms
were
distributed
to
the
poor
people
along
the
way
whenever
he
made
the
journey
between
durham
and
new
castle
eight
pounds
sterling
were
set
aside
for
this
purpose
five
pounds
for
each
journey
between
durham
and
stockton
or
middleham
and
five
marks
between
durham
and
auckland
money
had
at
that
time
at
least
ten
times
the
purchasing
power
which
it
has
at
present
so
that
it
will
be
easy
to
appreciate
the
good
bishop
eminent
liberality
that
richard
was
justified
in
his
admiration
of
the
books
of
the
time
we
know
from
those
that
remain
for
it
must
not
be
thought
for
a
moment
that
because
the
making
of
books
was
such
a
task
in
the
thirteenth
century
they
were
not
therefore
made
beautiful
on
the
contrary
as
we
shall
see
shortly
no
more
beautiful
books
have
ever
been
made
than
at
this
time
this
of
itself
would
show
how
precious
in
the
eyes
of
the
collectors
of
the
time
their
books
were
since
they
wanted
to
have
them
so
beautifully
made
and
were
satisfied
to
pay
the
high
prices
that
had
to
be
demanded
for
such
works
of
art
very
few
books
of
any
size
cost
less
than
the
equivalent
of
in
our
time
and
illuminated
books
cost
much
higher
than
this
yet
seem
never
to
have
been
a
drug
on
the
market
indeed
considering
the
number
of
them
that
are
still
in
existence
to
this
day
in
spite
of
the
accidents
of
fire
and
water
and
war
and
neglect
and
carelessness
and
ignorance
there
must
have
been
an
immense
number
of
very
handsome
books
made
by
the
generations
of
the
thirteenth
century
while
illumination
was
not
an
invention
of
the
thirteenth
century
as
indeed
were
very
few
of
the
great
art
features
of
the
century
during
this
time
book
decoration
was
carried
to
great
perfection
and
reached
that
development
which
artists
of
the
next
century
were
to
improve
on
in
certain
extrinsic
features
though
the
intrinsic
qualities
were
to
remain
those
which
had
been
determined
as
the
essential
characteristics
of
this
branch
of
art
in
the
earlier
time
the
thirteenth
century
for
instance
saw
the
introduction
of
the
miniature
as
a
principal
feature
and
also
the
drawing
out
of
initials
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
an
illuminated
border
for
the
whole
side
of
the
page
after
the
development
thus
given
to
the
art
in
the
thirteenth
century
further
evolution
could
only
come
in
certain
less
important
details
in
this
the
thirteenth
century
generations
were
accomplishing
what
they
had
done
in
practically
everything
else
that
they
touched
laying
foundations
broad
and
deep
and
giving
the
superstructure
the
commanding
form
which
future
generations
were
only
able
to
modify

slight
degree
and
not
always
with
absolute
good
grace
humphreys

of

different

widely
different
and
distinct
styles
the
most
showy
and
the
best
known
though
the
least
pure
and
inventive
in
design
being
that
of
the
middle
and
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
whilst
the
period
perhaps
the
least
generally
known
that
of
the
thirteenth
century
may
be
considered
as
the
most
interesting
and
original
many
of
the
best
works
of
that
period
displaying
an
astonishing
variety
and
profusion
of
invention
the
manuscript
of
which
two
pages
form
the
opposite

may
be
ranked
among
the
most
elaborate
and
profusely
ornamented
of
the
fine
books
of
that
era
every
page
being
sufficient
to
make
the
fortune
of
the
modern
decorator
by
the
quaint
and
unexpected
novelties
of
inventions
which
it
displays
at
every
turn
of
its
intricate
design
the
illuminations
of
the
century
then
are
worthy
of
the
time
and
also
typical
of
the
general
work
of
the
century
it
is
known
by
experts
for
its
originality
and
for
the
wealth
of
invention
displayed
in
the
designs
men
did
not
fear
that
they
might
exhaust
their
inventive
faculty
nor
display
their
originality
sparingly
in
order
that
they
might
have
enough
to
complete
other
work
as
the
workmen
of
the
cathedrals
the
artist
illuminators
devoted
their
very
best
efforts
to
each
piece
of
work
that
came
to
their
hands
and
the
results
are
masterpieces
of
art
in
this
as
in
every
other
department
of
the
period
the
details
are
beautifully
wrought
showing
the
power
of
the
artist
to
accomplish
such
a
work
and
yet
his
designs
are
never
overloaded
at
least
in
the
best
examples
of
the
century
with
details
of
ornamentation
that
obscure
and
minimize
the
effect
of
the
original
design
this
fault
was
to
be
the
error
of
his
most
sophisticated
successors
two
centuries
later
nor
must
it
be
thought
the
high
opinion
of
the
century
is
derived
from
the
fact
that
only
a
very
few
examples
of
its
illumination
and
bookmaking
are
now
extant
and
that
these
being
the
chosen
specimens
give
the
illumination
of
the
century
a
higher
place
than
it
might
otherwise
have
many
examples
have
been
preserved
and
some
of
them
are
the
most
beautiful
books
that
were
made
paris
was
particularly
the
home
of
this
form
of
art
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
indeed
the
school
established
there
influenced
all
the
modes
of
illumination
everywhere
so
much
so
that
dante
speaks
of
the
art
with
the
epithet
parisian
as
if
it
were
exclusively
done
there
the
incentive
to
the
development
of
this
form
of
art
came
from
louis
who
as
we
have
said
was
very
much
interested
in
books
his
taste
as
exhibited
in
la
sainte
chapelle
was
such
as
to
demand
artistic
excellence
of
high
grade
in
this
department
of
art
which
has
many
more
relations
with
the
architecture
of
the
period
and
especially
with
the
stained
glass
than
might
possibly
be
thought
at
the
present
time
for
most
of
the
decoration
of
books
partook
of
the
character
of
the
architectural
types
of
the
moment
among
the
most
precious
treasures
from
the
century
are
three
books
which
belonged
to
louis
himself
one
of
these
is
the
hours
or
office
book
a
second
is
his
psalter
which
contains
some
extremely
beautiful
initials
a
third
which
is
in
the
library
of
the
arsenal
at
paris
is
sometimes
known
as
the
prayer
book
of
louis
himself
though
a
better
name
for
it
would
be
the
prayer
book
of
queen
blanche
for
it
was
made
at
louis
orders
for
his
mother
the
famous
blanche
of
castile
and
is
a
worthy
testimonial
of
the
affectionate
relations
which
existed
between
mother
and
son
outside
of
paris
there
are
preserved
many
books
of
great
value
that
come
from
this
century
one
of
them
a
bestiarum
or
book
of
beasts
is
in
the
ashmoleam
museum
at
oxford
this
is
said
to
be
a
very
beautiful
example
of
the
illumination
of
the
thirteenth
century
but
it
is
even
more
interesting
because
it
shows
the
efforts
of
the
artists
of
the
time
to
copy
nature
in
the
pictures
of
animals
as
they
are
presented
there
is
said
to
be
an
acuity
of
observation
and
a
vigor
of
representation
displayed
in
the
book
which
is
highly
complimentary
to
the
powers
of
the
thirteenth
century
artists
even
these
brief
notes
of
the
books
and
libraries
of
the
thirteenth
century
will
serve
to
make
clear
how
enthusiastic
was
the
interest
of
the
generations
of
this
time
in
beautiful
books
and
in
collections
of
them
that
were
meant
for
show
as
well
as
for
practical
usefulness
there
is
perhaps
nothing
more
amusing
in
the
attitude
of
modern
generations
with
regard
to
the
middle
ages
than
the
assumption
that
all
the
methods
of
education
and
of
the
distribution
of
knowledge
worth
while
talking
about
are
the
inventions
of
comparatively
modern
times
the
fact
that
libraries
were
also
a
creation
of
that
time
and
that
most
of
the
regulations
which
are
supposed
to
be
the
first
fruit
of
quite
recent
science
in
the
circulation
of
books
had
been
adopted
by
these
earlier
generations
is
commonly
ignored
utterly
though
it
is
a
precious
bit
of
knowledge
that
can
not
help
but
increase
our
sympathy
with
those
bookmen
of
the
olden
times
who
thought
so
much
of
their
books
yet
wished
to
share
the
privilege
of
their
use
with
all
those
who
would
employ
them
properly
and
who
in
their
great
practical
way
succeeded
in
working
out
the
scheme
by
which
many
people
could
have
the
opportunity
of
consulting
the
treasures
they
thought
so
much
of
without
risk
of
their
loss
or
destruction
even
though
use
might
bring
some
deterioration

provided
for
at

as
large

the
people
as

the
creation

practically
great
technical

out

could
accomplish
supreme
artistic
results
in

and
did
more
and
better
for

than
any
subsequent
generation
can
scarcely
help
but
turn
with
interest
to
read
the
book
of
the
words
of
the
period
and
to
find
out
what
forms
of
literature
interested
this
surprising
people
one
is
almost
sure
to
think
at
the
first
moment
of
consideration
that
the
literature
will
not
be
found
worthy
of
the
other
achievements
of
the
times
in
most
men
minds
the
thirteenth
century
does
not
readily
call
up
the
idea
of
a
series
of
great
works
in
literature
whose
influence
has
been
at
all
as
profound
and
enduring
as
that
of
the
universities
in
the
educational
order
or
of
the
cathedrals
in
the
artistic
order
this
false
impression
however
is
due
only
to
the
fact
that
the
literary
creations
of
the
thirteenth
century
are
so
diverse
in
subject
and
in
origin
that
they
are
very
seldom
associated
with
each
other
unless
there
has
been
actual
recognition
of
their
contemporaneousness
from
deliberate
calling
to
mind
of
the
dates
at
which
certain
basic
works
in
our
modern
literatures
were
composed
it
is
not
the
least
surprise
that
comes
to
the
student
of
the
thirteenth
century
to
find
that
the
great
origins
of
what
well
deserves
the
name
of
classic
modern
literature
comprising
a
series
of
immortal
works
in
prose
and
poetry
were
initiated
by
the
contemporaries
of
the
makers
of
the
universities
and
the
builders
of
the
cathedrals
if
we
stop
to
think
for
a
moment
it
must
be
realized
that
generations
who
succeeded
in
expressing
themselves
so
effectively
in
other
departments
of
esthetics
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
fail
in
literature
alone
and
they
did
not
from
the
cid
in
spain
through
the
arthur
legends
in
england
the
nibelungen
in
germany
the
minnesingers
and
the
meistersingers
in
the
southern
part
of
what
is
now
the
german
empire
the
trouvères
in
north
france
the
troubadours
in
south
france
and
in
italy
down
to
dante
who
was
before
the
century
closed
there
has
never
been
such
a
mass
of
undying
literature
written
within
a
little
more
than
a
single
hundred
years
as
came
during
the
period
from
shortly
before
down
to
great
as
was
the
fifth
century
before
christ
in
this
matter
it
did
not
surpass
the
thirteenth
century
after
christ
in
its
influence
on
subsequent
generations
we
have
already
pointed
out
in
discussing
the
cathedrals
that
one
of
the
most
characteristic
features
of
the
gothic
architecture
was
the
marvelous
ease
with
which
it
lent
itself
to
the
expression
of
national
peculiarities
norman
gothic
is
something
quite
distinct
from
german
gothic
which
arose
in
almost
contiguous
provinces
but
so
it
is
also
from
english
gothic
these
two
were
very
closely
related
in
origin
and
undoubtedly
the
english
cathedrals
owe
much
to
the
norman
influence
so
prevalent
in
england
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
italian
gothic
has
the
principal
characteristic
peculiarities
of
the
architectural
style
which
passes
under
the
name
developed
to
a
remarkable
degree
and
yet
its
finished
product
is
far
distant
from
any
of
the
three
other
national
forms
that
have
been
mentioned
yet
is
not
lacking
in
a
similar
interest
spanish
gothic
has
an
identity
of
its
own
that
has
always
had
a
special
appeal
for
the
traveler
any
one
who
has
ever
visited
the
shores
of
the
baltic
sea
and
has
seen
what
was
accomplished
in
such
places
as
stralsund
greifswald
lübeck
and
others
of
the
old
hansa
towns
will
appreciate
still
more
the
power
of
gothic
to
lend
itself
to
the
feelings
of
the
people
and
to
the
materials
that
they
had
at
hand
here
in
the
distant
north
they
were
far
away
from
any
sources
of
the
stone
that
would
ordinarily
be
deemed
absolutely
necessary
for
gothic
construction
how
effectively
they
used
brick
for
ecclesiastical
edifices
can
only
be
realized
by
those
who
have
seen
the
remains
of
the
gothic
monuments
of
this
portion
of
europe
the
distinguishing
mark
of
all
these
different
styles
is
the
eminent
opportunity
for
the
expression
of
nationality
which
they
afford
it
might
be
expected
that
since
they
were
all
gothic
most
of
them
would
be
little
better
than
servile
copies
or
at
best
scarce
more
than
good
imitations
of
the
great
originals
of
the
north
of
france
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
assertion
of
national
characteristics
far
from
destroying
the
effectiveness
of
gothic
rather
added
new
beauties
to
this
style
of
architecture
this
was
true
even
occasionally
when
mistakes
were
made
by
architects
and
designers
as
ferguson
has
said
in
his
history
of
architecture
stephen
at
vienna
is
full
of
architectural
errors
and
yet
the
attractiveness
of
the
cathedral
remains
it
was
a
poet
who
designed
it
and
something
of
his
poetic
soul
gleams
out
of
the
material
structure
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
in
nearly
this
same
way
the
literatures
of
the
different
countries
during
the
thirteenth
century
are
eminently
national
and
mirror
with
quite
wonderful
appropriateness
the
characteristics
of
the
various
people
this
is
true
even
when
similar
subjects
as
for
instance
the
graal
stories
are
treated
from
nearly
the
same
standpoint
by
the
two
teutonic
nations
the
germans
and
the
english
parsifal
and
galahad
are
national
as
well
as
poetic
heroes
with
a
distinction
of
character
all
their
own
as
we
shall
see
practically
every
nation
finds
in
this
century
some
fundamental
expression
of
its
national
feeling
that
has
been
among
its
most
cherished
classics
ever
since
illustration
santa
maria
sopra
minerva
rome
gothic
cathedral
the
first
of
these
in
time
is
the
cid
which
was
written
in
spain
during
the
latter
half
of
the
twelfth
century
but
probably
took
its
definite
form
just
about
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
it
might
well
be
considered
that
this
spanish
ballad
would
have
very
little
of
interest
for
modern
readers
and
yet
there
are
very
few
scholars
of
the
past
century
who
have
not
been
interested
in
this
literary
treasure
critics
of
all
nations
have
been
unstinted
in
their
praise
of
it
since
the
schlegels
recalled
world
attention
to
spanish
literature
it
has
been
considered
almost
as
unpardonable
for
anyone
who
pretended
to
literary
culture
not
to
have
read
the
cid
as
it
would
be
not
to
have
read
don
quixote
as
is
true
of
all
the
national
epics
founded
upon
a
series
of
ballads
which
had
been
collecting
in
the
mouth
of
the
people
for
several
centuries
before
a
great
poetic
genius
came
to
give
them
their
supreme
expression
there
has
been
some
doubt
expressed
as
to
the
single
authorship
of
cid
we
shall
find
the
same
problem
to
be
considered
when
we
come
to
discuss
the
nibelungen
lied
a
half
a
century
ago
or
more
the
fashion
of
the
critics
for
insisting
on
the
divided
authorship
of
such
poems
was
much
more
prevalent
than
it
is
at
present
at
that
time
a
great
many
scholars
following
the
initiative
of
wolf
and
the
german
separatist
critics
declared
even
that
the
homeric
poems
were
due
to
more
than
one
mind
there
are
still
some
who
cling
to
this
idea
with
regard
to
many
of
these
primal
national
epics
but
at
the
present
time
most
literary
men
are
quite
content
to
accept
the
idea
of
a
single
authorship
with
regard
to
the
cid
in
this
matter
fitzmaurice
kelly
in
his
short
history
of
spanish
literature
in
the
literatures
of
the
world
series
says
very
simply
there
is
a
unity
of
conception
and
of
language
which
forbids
our
accepting
the
poema
del
cid
as
the
work
of
several
hands
and
the
division
of
the
poem
into
several
cantares
is
managed
with
a
discretion
which
argues
a
single
artistic
intelligence
the
first
part
closes
with
the
marriage
of
the
hero
daughters
the
second
with
the
shame
of
the
infantes
de
carrion
and
the
proud
announcement
that
the
kings
of
spain
are
sprung
from
the
loins
in
both
the
singer
rises
to
the
level
of
his
subject
but
his
chiefest
gust
is
in
the
recital
of
some
brilliant
deed
of
arms
the
spanish
ballad
epic
is
a
characteristic
example
of
the
epics
formed
by
the
earliest
poetic
genius
of
a
country
on
the
basis
of
the
patriotic
stories
of
national
origin
that
had
been
accumulating
for
centuries
of
course
the
cid
had
to
be
the
christian
hero
who
did
most
in
his
time
against
the
moslem
in
spain
so
interesting
has
his
story
been
made
and
so
glorious
have
been
his
deeds
as
recorded
by
the
poets
that
there
has
been
even
some
doubt
of
his
existence
expressed
but
that
he
was
a
genuine
historical
character
seems
to
be
clear
many
people
will
recall
the
canons
argument
in
the
chapter
of
don
quixote
in
which
cervantes
evidently
speaking
for
himself
says
that
there
was
a
cid
no
one
will
deny
and
likewise
a
bernardo
del
carpio
but
that
they
performed
all
the
exploits
ascribed
to
them
i
believe
there
is
good
reason
to
doubt
the
cid
derives
his
name
from
the
arabic
seid
which
means
lord
and
owes
his
usual
epithet
el
campeador
champion
to
the
fact
that
he
was
the
actual
champion
of
the
christians
against
the
moors
at
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
how
gloriously
his
warlike
exploits
have
been
described
may
be
best
appreciated
from
the
following
description
of
his
charge
at
alcocer
with
bucklers
braced
before
their
breasts
with
lances
pointing
low
with
stooping
crests
and
heads
bent
down
above
the
all
firm
of
hand
and
high
of
heart
they
roll
upon
the
foe
and
he
that
in
good
hour
was
born
his
clarion
voice
rings
out
and
clear
above
the
clang
of
arms
is
heard
his
them
gentlemen
strike
home
for
the
love
of
charity
the
champion
of
bivar
is
here
ruy
diaz
i
am
he
then
bearing
where
bermuez

maintains

three

their

hundred
moors
to
earth
a
man
to
every
blow
and
when
they
wheel
three
hundred
more
as
charging
back
they
go
it
was
a
sight
to
see
the
lances
rise
and
fall
that
day
the
shivered
shields
and
riven
mail
to
see
how
thick
they
lay
the
pennons
that

gory

the

the
riders

while

muhamed
and
james
the
christians
cry
while
the
martial
interest
of
such
early
poems
would
be
generally
conceded
it
would
usually
be
considered
that
they
would
be
little
likely
to
have
significant
domestic
and
even
what
might
be
called
romantic
interests
the
cid
marriage
is
the
result
of
not
what
would
exactly
be
called
a
romance
nowadays
though
in
ruder
times
there
may
have
been
a
certain
sense
of
sentimental
reparation
in
it
at
least
he
had
killed
in
fair
fight
the
father
of
a
young
woman
who
being
thus
left
without
a
protector
appealed
to
the
king
to
appoint
one
for
her
in
the
troublous
middle
ages
an
heiress
was
as
likely
to
be
snapped
up
by
some
unsuitable
suitor
more
literally
but
with
quite
as
much
haste
as
in
a
more
cultured
epoch
the
king
knew
no
one
whom
he
could
trust
so
well
with
the
guardianship
of
the
rich
and
fair
young
orphan
than
the
cid
of
whose
bravery
and
honor
he
had
had
many
proofs
accordingly
he
suggested
him
as
a
protector
and
the
cid
himself
generously
realizing
how
much
the
fair
jimena
had
lost
by
the
death
of
her
father
consented
and
in
a
famous
passage
of
the
poem
a
little
shocking
to
modern
ideas
it
must
be
confessed
frankly
states
his
feelings
in
the
matter
and
now
before
the
altar
the
bride
and
bridegroom
stand
and
when
to
fair
jimena
the
cid
stretched
forth
his
hand
he
spake
in
great
confusion
father
have
i
slain
not
treacherously
but
face
to
face
my
just
revenge
to
gain
for
cruel
wrong
a
man
i
slew
a
man
i
give
to
thee
in
place
of
thy
dead
father
a
husband
find
in
me
and
all
who
heard
well
liked
the
man
approving
what
he
said
thus
rodrigo
the
castilian
his
stately
bride
did
there
are
tender
domestic
scenes
between
the
cid
and
his
wife
and
his
daughters
which
serve
to
show
how
sincere
was
his
affection
and
with
what
sympathetic
humanity
a
great
poet
knew
how
to
depict
the
tender
natural
relations
which
have
an
interest
for
all
times
some
of
these
domestic
scenes
are
not
unworthy
to
be
placed
beside
homer
picture
of
the
parting
of
hector
and
andromache
though
there
is
more
naive
in
the
work
of
the
spanish
bard
than
in
that
of
his
more
artistic
colleague
of
the
grecian
olden
times
there
is
particularly
a
famous
picture
of
the
duties
of
noble
ladies
in
spain
of
this
time
and
of
the
tender
solicitude
of
a
father
for
his
daughters
innocence
that
is
quite
beyond
expectation
at
the
hands
of
a
poet
whose
forte
was
evidently
war
and
its
alarms
rather
than
the
expression
of
the
ethical
qualities
of
home
life
the
following
passage
descriptive
of
the
cid
parting
from
his
wife
will
give
some
idea
of
these
qualities
better
than
could
be
conveyed
in
any
other
way
thou
knowest
well
señora
he
said
before
he
went
to
parting
from
each
other
our
love
doth
not
consent
but
love
and
joyance
never
may
stand
in
duty
way
and
when
the
king
commandeth
the
noble
must
obey
now
let
discretion
guide
thee
thou
art
of
worthy
name
while
i
am
parted
from
thee
let
none
in
thee
find
blame
employ
thy
hours
full
wisely
and
tend
thy
household
well
be
never
slothful
woe
and
death
with
idleness
do
dwell
lay
by
thy
costly
dresses
until
i
come
again
for
in
the
husband
absence
let
wives
in
dress
be
plain
and
look
well
to
thy
daughters
nor
let
them
be
aware
they
comprehend
the
danger
because
they
see
thy
care
and
lose
unconscious
innocence
at
home
they
must
abide
for
the
safety
of
the
daughter
is
at
the
mother
be
serious
with
thy
servants
with
strangers
on
thy
guard

friends
be
kind
and
friendly
and
well
thy
household

no
one

my
letters
thy
best
friends
may
not

lest
reading
them
they
also
may
guess

thine
to
me
and
if
good
news
they
bring
thee
and

seek
the
sympathy
of

only
speak
farewell
farewell
jimena
the
trumpet
call
i
hear
one
last
embrace
and
then
he
mounts
the
steed
without
a
peer
the
touch
of
paternal
solicitude
and
prudence
in
the
passage
we
have
put
in
italics
is
so
apparently
modern
that
it
can
scarcely
fail
to
be
a
source
of
surprise
coming
as
it
does
from
that
crude
period
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
when
such
minute
psychological
observation
as
to
young
folks
ways
would
be
little
expected
and
least
of
all
in
the
rough
warrior
hero
or
his
poet
creator
whose
notions
of
right
and
wrong
are
to
judge
from
many
passages
of
the
poem
so
much
coarser
than
those
of
our
time
after
the
cid
in
point
of
time
the
next
enduring
poetic
work
that
was
destined
to
have
an
influence
on
all
succeeding
generations
was
the
series
of
the
arthur
legends
as
completed
in
england
as
in
the
case
of
the
cid
these
stories
of
king
arthur
court
his
knights
and
his
round
table
had
been
for
a
long
time
the
favorite
subject
of
ballad
poets
among
the
english
people
just
where
they
originated
is
not
very
clear
though
it
seems
most
likely
that
the
original
inspiration
came
from
celtic
sources
these
old
ballads
however
had
very
little
of
literary
form
and
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
twelfth
and
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
they
were
cast
in
their
present
mold
after
having
passed
through
the
alembic
of
the
mind
of
a
great
poetic
and
literary
genius
which
refined
away
the
dross
and
left
only
the
pure
gold
of
supremely
sympathetic
human
stories
to
whom
we
owe
this
transformation
is
not
known
with
absolute
certainty
though
the
literary
and
historical
criticism
of
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
seems
to
have
made
it
clear
that
the
work
must
be
attributed
to
walter
map
or
mapes
an
english
clergyman
who
died
during
the
first
decade
of
the
thirteenth
century
his
claims
to
the
authorship
of
the
graal
legend
in
its
artistic
completeness
and
to
the
invention
of
the
character
of
lancelot
which
is
one
of
the
great
triumphs
of
the
arthur
legends
as
they
were
told
at
this
time
have
been
much
discussed
by
french
and
english
critics
this
discussion
has
perhaps
been
best
summarized
by
henry
morley
the
late
professor
of
literature
at
the
university
of
london
whose
third
volume
of
english
writers
contains
an
immense
amount
of
valuable
information
with
regard
to
the
literary
history
not
alone
of
england
at
this
time
but
practically
of
all
the
countries
of
europe
morley
plan
was
conceived
with
a
breath
of
view
that
makes
his
work
a
very
interesting
and
authoritative
guide
in
the
literary
matters
of
the
time
his
summation
of
the
position
of
critical
opinion
with
regard
to
the
authorship
of
the
arthur
legends
deserves
to
be
quoted
in
its
entirety
the
arthurian
romances
were
according
to
this
opinion
all
perfectly
detached
tales
till
in
the
twelfth
century
robert
de
borron
let
us
add
at
map
suggestion
translated
the
first
romance
of
the
graal
as
an
introduction
to
the
series
and
shortly
afterwards
walter
map
added
his
quest
of
the
graal
lancelot
and
mort
artus
the
way
for
such
work
had
been
prepared
by
geoffrey
of
monmouth
bold
setting
forward
of
king
arthur
as
a
personage
of
history
in
a
book
that
was
much
sought
and
discussed
and
that
made
the
arthurian
romances
a
fresh
subject
of
interest
to
educated
men
but
paulin
paris
whose
opinions
founded
upon
a
wide
acquaintance
with
the
contents
of
old
mss
i
am
now
sketching
and
in
part
adopting
looked
upon
walter
map
as
the
soul
of
this
work
of
christian
spiritualisation
was
the
romance
of
the
graal
latin
before
it
was
french
he
does
not
doubt
that
it
was
he
sees
in
it
the
mysticism
of
the
subtlest
theologian
it
was
not
a
knight
or
a
jongleur
who
was
so
well
read
in
the
apocryphal
gospels
the
legends
of
the
first
christian
centuries
rabbinical
fancies
and
old
greek
mythology
and
there
is
all
this
in
the
graal
there
is
a
theory
too
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
an
explanation
of
the
saviour
presence
in
the
eucharist
that
is
the
work
he
says
of
the
loftiest
and
the
most
brilliant
imagination
these
were
not
matters
that
a
knight
of
the
twelfth
century
would
dare
to
touch
they
came
from
an
ecclesiastic
and
a
man
of
genius
but
if
so
why
should
we
refuse
credit
to
the
assertion
repeated
in
every
that
they
were
first
written
in
latin
the
earliest
mss
are
of
a
date
not
long
subsequent
to
the
death
of
walter
map
latinist
theologian
wit
and
chaplain
to
king
henry
who
himself
took
the
liveliest
interest
in
breton
legends
king
henry
paris
supposes
wished
them
to
be
collected
but
how
some
would
prefer
one
method
some
another
map
reconciled
all
he
satisfied
the
clergy
pleased
the
scholar
filled
the
chasms
in
the
popular
tales
reconciled
contradictions
or
rejected
inconsistencies
and
by
him
also
the
introductory
tale
of
the
graal
was
first
written
in
latin
for
robert
de
borron
to
translate
into
french
the
best
literary
appreciation
of
map
genius
apart
of
course
from
the
fact
that
all
generations
ever
since
have
acknowledged
the
supreme
human
interest
and
eminently
sympathetic
quality
of
his
work
is
perhaps
to
be
found
in
certain
remarks
of
the
modern
critics
who
have
made
special
studies
in
these
earlier
literary
periods
george
saintsbury
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
for
instance
in
the
second
volume
of
periods
of
english
literature
footnote
has
been
quite
unstinted
in
his
praise
of
this
early
english
writer
he
has
not
hesitated
even
to
say
in
a
striking
passage
that
map
or
at
least
the
original
author
of
the
launcelot
story
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
literary
men
and
deserves
a
place
only
next
to
dante
in
this
century
so
preciously
full
of
artistic
initiative
footnote
the
flourishing
of

it

or

or
neither
to
whom
the
glory
of
at
once
completing
and
exalting
the
story
is
due
i
at
least
have
no
pretension
to
decide
whoever
did
it
if
he
did
it
by
himself
was
a
great
man
indeed
a
man
second
to
dante
among
the
men
of
the
middle
age
even
if
it
was
done
by
an
irregular
company
of
men
each
patching
and
piecing
the
efforts
the
result
shows
a
marvelous
of
the
spirit
abroad
and
blowing
on
that
company
saintsbury
then
proceeds
to
show
how
much
even
readers
of
mallory
miss
of
the
greatness
and
especially
of
the
sympathetic
humanity
of
the
original
poem
and
in
a
further
passage
states
his
firm
conviction
that
the
man
who
created
lancelot
was
one
of
the
greatest
literary
inventors
and
sympathetic
geniuses
of
all
times
and
that
his
work
is
destined
because
the
wellsprings
of
its
action
are
so
deep
down
in
the
human
heart
to
be
of
interest
to
generations
of
men
for
as
long
as
our
present
form
of
civilization
lasts
perhaps
the
great
artistic
stroke
in
the
whole
legend
and
one
of
the
greatest
in
all
literature
is
the
concoction
of
a
hero
who
should
be
not
only
paris
handsome
and
like
hector
brave
but
more
heroic
than
paris
and
more
interesting
than
hector
not
only
a
knight
but
at
once
the
sinful
lover
of
his
queen
and
the
champion
who
should
himself
all
but
achieve
and
in
the
person
of
his
son
actually
achieve
the
sacred
adventure
of
the
holy
graal
if
as
there
seems
no
valid
reason
to
disbelieve
the
hitting
upon
this
idea
and
the
invention
or
adoption
of
lancelot
to
carry
it
out
be
the
work
of
walter
mapes
or
map
then
walter
mapes
is
one
of
the
great
novelists
of
the
world
and
one
of
the
greatest
of
them
if
it
was
some
unknown
person
it
could
hardly
be
chrestien
for
in
chrestien
form
the
graal
interest
belongs
to
percevale
not
to
lancelot
or
galahad
then
the
same
compliment
must
be
paid
to
that
person
unknown
meanwhile
the
conception
and
execution
of
lancelot
to
whomsoever
they
may
be
due
are
things
most
happy
entirely
free
from
the
faultlessness
which
is
the
curse
of
the
classical
hero
his
unequaled
valor
not
seldom
rewarded
only
by
reverses
his
merits
redeemed
from
mawkishness
by
his
one
great
fault
yet
including
all
virtues
that
are
themselves
most
amiable
and
deformed
by
no
vice
that
is
actually
loathsome
the
soul
of
goodness
in
him
always
warring
with
his
human
frailty
sir
lancelot
fully
deserves
the
noble
funeral
eulogy
pronounced
over
his
grave
felt
by
all
the
elect
to
be
in
both
senses
one
of
the
first
of
all
extant
pieces
of
perfect
english
prose
to
appreciate
fully
how
much
walter
map
accomplished
by
his
series
of
stories
with
regard
to
king
arthur
court
it
should
be
remembered
that
poets
and
painters
have
in
many
generations
ever
since
found
subjects
for
their
inspiration
within
the
bounds
of
the
work
which
he
created
after
all
the
main
interest
of
succeeding
poets
who
have
put
the
legends
into
later
forms
has
centered
more
in
the
depth
of
humanity
that
there
is
in
the
stories
than
in
the
poetic
details
for
which
they
themselves
have
been
responsible
in
succeeding
generations
poets
have
often
felt
that
these
stories
were
so
beautiful
that
they
deserved
to
be
retold
in
terms
readily
comprehensible
to
their
own
generation
hence
malory
wrote
his
morte
for
the
fifteenth
century
spenser
used
certain
portions
of
the
old
myths
for
the
sixteenth
and
the
late
set
himself
once
more
to
retell
the
idyls
of
the
king
for
the
nineteenth
century
each
of
these
was
adding
little
but
new
literary
form
to
a
work
that
genius
had
drawn
from
sources
so
close
to
the
heart
of
human
nature
that
the
stories
were
always
to
remain
of
enduring
interest
for
the
treasure
of
poesy
with
which
humanity
was
enriched
when
he
conceived
the
idea
of
setting
the
old
ballads
of
king
arthur
into
literary
form
more
must
be
considered
as
due
to
the
literary
original
writer
than
to
any
of
his
great
successors
this
is
precisely
the
merit
of
walter
map
of
some
of
his
less
ambitious
literary
work
we
have
many
examples
that
show
us
how
thoroughly
interested
he
was
in
all
the
details
of
human
existence
even
the
most
trivial
he
had
his
likes
and
dislikes
he
seems
to
have
had
some
disappointed
ambition
that
made
him
rather
bitter
towards
ecclesiastics
he
seems
to
have
had
some
unfortunate
experiences
especially
with
the
cistercians
though
how
much
of
this
is
assumed
rather
than
genuine
is
hard
to
determine
at
this
modern
day
many
of
the
extremely
bitter
things
he
says
with
regard
to
the
cistercians
might
well
be
considered
as
examples
of
that
exaggeration
which
in
certain
minds
constitutes
one
modality
of
humor
rather
than
as
serious
expressions
of
actual
thought
it
is
hard
for
instance
to
take
such
an
expression
as
the
following
as
more
than
an
example
of
this
form
of
jesting
by
exaggeration
map
heard
that
a
cistercian
had
become
a
jew
his
comment
was
if
he
wanted
to
get
far
from
the
cistercians
why
he
become
a
christian
from
england
the
transition
to
germany
is
easy
exactly
contemporary
with
the
rise
of
the
arthur
legends
in
england
to
that
standard
of
literary
excellence
that
was
to
give
them
their
enduring
poetic
value
there
came
also
the
definite
arrangement
and
literary
transformation
of
the
old
ballads
of
the
german
people
into
that
form
in
which
they
were
to
exert
a
lasting
influence
upon
the
german
language
and
national
feeling
the
date
of
the
nibelungen
lied
has
been
set
down
somewhat
indefinitely
as
between
and
most
of
the
work
was
undoubtedly
accomplished
after
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
in
the
form
in
which
we
have
it
at
present
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
much
was
done
after
the
famous
meeting
of
the
meistersingers
on
the
wartburg
the
subject
of
song
and
story
and
music
drama
ever
since
which
took
place
very
probably
in
the
year
with
regard
to
the
nibelungen
lied
as
in
the
case
of
the
other
great
literary
arrangements
of
there
has
been
question
as
to
the
singleness
of
authorship
here
however
as
with
regard
to
homer
and
the
cid
the
trend
of
modern
criticism
has
all
been
towards
the
attribution
of
the
poem
to
one
writer
and
the
internal
evidence
of
similarity
of
expression
constantly
maintained
a
certain
simplicity
of
feeling
and
naïveté
of
repetition
seems
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
matter
as
regards
the
merits
of
the
nibelungen
lied
as
a
great
work
of
literature
there
has
been
very
little
doubt
in
the
world
at
least
because
of
the
enthusiastic
recognition
accorded
it
by
german
critics
and
the
influence
of
german
criticism
in
all
branches
of
literature
over
the
whole
teutonic
race
during
the
nineteenth
century
english
admiration
for
the
poem
began
after
introduction
of
it
to
the
english
reading
public
in
his
essays
since
this
time
it
has
come
to
be
very
well
known
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
that
has
been
said
about
it
no
english
critic
has
expressed
more
fully
the
place
of
the
great
german
poem
in
world
literature
than
did
this
enthusiastic
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
for
those
for
whom
carlyle
essays
are
a
sealed
book
because
of
loss
of
interest
in
him
with
the
passage
of
time
the
citation
of
some
of
his
appreciative
critical
expressions
may
be
necessary
here
in
the
old
frankish
oberdeutsch
dialect
of
the
nibelungen
we
have
a
clear
decisive
utterance
and
in
a
real
system
of
verse
not
without
essential
regularity
great
liveliness
and
now
and
then
even
harmony
of
rhythm
doubtless
we
must
often
call
it
a
diffuse
diluted
utterance
at
the
same
time
it
is
genuine
with
a
certain
antique
garrulous
heartiness
and
has
a
rhythm
in
the
thoughts
as
well
as
the
words
the
simplicity
is
never
silly
even
in
that
perpetual
recurrence
of
epithets
sometimes
of
rhymes
as
where
two
words
for
instance
lip
body
lif
leib
and
wip
woman
weib
wife
are
indissolubly
wedded
together
and
the
one
never
shows
itself
without
the
other
following
there
is
something
which
reminds
us
not
so
much
of
poverty
as
of
trustfulness
and
childlike
innocence
indeed
a
strange
charm
lies
in
those
old
tones
where
in
gay
dancing
melodies
the
sternest
tidings
are
sung
to
us
and
deep
floods
of
sadness
and
strife
play
lightly
in
little
purling
billows
like
seas
in
summer
it
is
as
a
meek
smile
in
whose
still
thoughtful
depths
a
whole
infinitude
of
patience
and
love
and
heroic
strength
lie
revealed
but
in
other
cases
too
we
have
seen
this
outward
sport
and
inward
earnestness
offer
grateful
contrasts
and
cunning
excitement
for
example
in
tasso
of
whom
though
otherwise
different
enough
this
old
northern
singer
has
more
than
once
reminded
us
there
too
as
here
we
have
a
dark
solemn
meaning
in
light
guise
deeds
of
high
temper
harsh
daring
and
death
stand
embodied
in
that
soft
verse
nay
farther
as
if
the
implement
much
more
than
we
might
fancy
had
influenced
the
work
done
these
two
poems
could
we
trust
our
individual
feeling
have
in
one
respect
the
same
poetical
result
for
us
in
the
nibelungen
as
in
the
gerusalemme
the
persons
and
their
story
are
indeed
brought
vividly
before
us
yet
not
near
and
palpably
present
it
is
rather
as
if
we
looked
on
that
scene
through
an
inverted
telescope
whereby
the
whole
was
carried
far
away
into
the
distance
the
figures
compressed
into
brilliant
miniatures
so
clear
so
real
yet
tiny
and
beautiful
as
well
as
lessened
their
colors
being
now
closer
and
brighter
the
shadows
and
trivial
features
no
longer
visible
this
as
we
partly
apprehend
comes
of
singing
epic
poems
most
part
of
which
only
pretend
to
be
sung
tasso
rich
melody
still
lives
among
the
italian
people
the
nibelungen
also
is
what
it
professes
to
be
a
song
the
story
of
the
nibelungen
would
ordinarily
be
supposed
to
be
so
distant
from
the
interests
of
modern
life
as
scarcely
to
hold
the
attention
of
a
reader
unless
he
were
interested
in
it
from
a
scholarly
or
more
or
less
antiquarian
standpoint
for
those
who
think
thus
however
there
is
only
one
thing
that
will
correct
such
a
false
impression
and
that
is
to
read
the
nibelungen
itself
it
has
a
depth
of
simplicity
and
a
sympathetic
human
interest
all
its
own
but
that
reminds
one
more
of
homer
than
of
anything
else
in
literature
and
homer
has
faults
but
lack
of
interest
is
not
one
of
them
from
the
very
beginning
the
story
of
the
young
man
who
does
not
think
he
will
marry
and
whose
mother
does
not
think
that
any
one
is
good
enough
for
him
and
of
the
young
woman
who
is
sure
that
no
one
will
come
that
will
attract
enough
of
her
attention
so
as
to
compel
her
to
subject
herself
to
the
yoke
of
marriage
are
types
of
what
is
so
permanent
in
humanity
that
the
readers
attention
is
at
once
caught
after
this
the
fighting
parts
of
the
story
become
the
center
of
interest
and
hold
the
attention
in
spite
of
the
refining
influences
that
later
centuries
are
supposed
to
have
brought
to
humanity
hence
it
is
that
saintsbury
in
the
second
volume
of
his
periods
of
european
literature
already
quoted
from
is
able
to
say
much
of
the
modern
interest
in
the
story
there
may
be
as
he
says
too
many
episodic
personages
deitrich
of
bern
for
instance
has
extremely
little
to
do
in
this
galley
but
the
strength
thoroughness
and
in
its
own
savage
way
charm
of
kriemhild
character
and
the
incomparable
series
of
battles
between
the
burgundian
princes
and
etzel
men
in
the
later
cantos
cantos
which
contain
the
very
best
poetical
fighting
in
the
history
of
the
world
far
more
than
redeem
this
the
nibelungen
lied
is
a
very
great
poem
and
with
beowulf
the
oldest
but
the
least
interesting
on
the
whole
roland
the
most
artistically
finished
in
form
and
the
poem
of
the
cid
the
cheerfullest
and
perhaps
the
fullest
of
character
composes
a
quartette
of
epics
with
which
the
literary
story
of
the
great
european
literary
nations
most
appropriately
begins
in
bulk
dramatic
completeness
and
a
certain
furia
the
nibelungen
lied
though
the
youngest
and
probably
the
least
original
is
the
greatest
of
the
four
less
need
be
said
of
the
nibelungen
than
of
the
cid
or
walter
work
because
it
is
much
more
familiar
and
even
ordinary
readers
of
literature
have
been
brought
more
closely
in
touch
with
it
because
of
its
relation
to
the
wagnerian
operas
even
those
who
know
the
fine
old
german
poems
only
passingly
will
yet
realize
the
supreme
genius
of
their
author
and
those
who
need
to
have
the
opinions
of
distinguished
critics
to
back
them
before
they
form
an
estimate
for
themselves
will
not
need
to
seek
far
in
our
modern
literature
to
find
lofty
praises
of
the
old
german
epic
with
even
this
brief
treatment
no
reader
will
doubt
that
there
is
in
these
three
epics
typical
products
of
the
literary
spirit
of
three
great
european
nations
whose
literatures
rising
high
above
these
deep
firm
substructures
were
to
be
of
the
greatest
influence
in
the
development
of
the
human
mind
and
yet
were
to
remain
practically
always
within
the
limits
of
thought
and
feeling
that
had
been
traced
by
these
old
founders
of
literature
of
the
early
thirteenth
century
whose
work
like
that
of
their
contemporaries
in
every
other
form
of
artistic
expression
was
to
be
the
model
and
the
source
of
inspiration

it
would
be
a
supreme
mistake
to
think
because
the
idea
of
literature
in
the
thirteenth
century
is
usually
associated
with
the
arthur
legends
the
nibelungen
and
dante
that
all
of
the
literary
content
of
the
century
was
inevitably
serious
in
character
or
always
epical
in
form
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
soul
of
wit
and
humor
had
entered
into
the
body
social
as
we
shall
see
in
subsequent
chapters
and
the
spirit
of
gaiety
and
the
admiration
for
nature
found
as
frequent
expression
as
at
any
time
in
history
with
these
as
always
in
literary
history
there
came
outbursts
of
love
in
lyric
strains
that
were
not
destined
to
die
while
the
poets
of
south
germany
and
of
italy
sang
of
love
that
was
of
the
loftiest
description
never
mingled
with
anything
of
the
merely
sensual
their
tuneful
trifles
are
quite
as
satisfying
to
the
modern
ear
in
both
sense
and
sound
as
any
of
the
more
elaborate
de
of
the
modern
times
the
german
poets
particularly
did
not
hesitate
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
sensuality
had
no
part
in
minne
their
pretty
term
for
love
and
yet
they
sang
with
all
the
natural
grace
and
fervid
rapture
of
the
grecian
poets
of
the
old
pagan
times
worshiping
at
the
shrines
of
fleshly
goddesses
or
singing
to
the
frail
beauties
of
an
unmoral
period
nothing
in
the
history
of
literature
is
better
proof
that
ideal
love
can
unmixed
with
anything
sensual
inspire
lyric
outbursts
of
supreme
and
enduring
beauty
than
the
poems
of
the
minnesingers
and
of
some
of
the
french
and
italian
troubadours
of
this
period
it
is
easier
to
understand
dante
position
in
this
matter
after
reading
the
poems
of
his
predecessors
in
the
thirteenth
century
for
this
feeling
of
the
lofty
character
of
the
love
they
sang
was
not
in
spite
of
what
is
sometimes
said
confined
only
to
the
germans
though
as
is
well
known
from
time
immemorial
the
teutonic
feeling
towards
woman
was
by
racial
influence
of
higher
character
than
that
of
the
southern
nations
as
chaytor
says
in
the
introduction
to
his
troubadours
of
dante
there
came
a
gradual
change
over
the
mind
of
the
troubadour
about
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
seeing
that
love
was
the
inspiring
force
to
good
deeds
the
later
troubadours
gradually
dissociated
their
love
from
the
object
which
had
aroused
it
among
them
as
among
the
minnesingers
love
is
no
longer
sexual
passion
it
is
rather
the
motive
to
great
works
to
to
the
winning
an
honorable
name
as
courtier
and
poet
chaytor
then
quotes
the
well
known
lines
from
bernart
de
ventadorn
one
of
the
troubadours
to
whom
dante
refers
and
whose
works
dante
seems
to
have
read
with
special
attention
since
their
poems
contain
similar
errors
of
mythology
for
indeed
i
know
of
no
more
subtle
passion
under
heaven
than
is
the
maiden
passion
for
a
maid
not
only
to
keep
down
the
base
in
man
but
teach
high
thought
and
amiable
words
and
courtliness
and
the
desire
of
fame
and
love
of
truth
and
all
that
makes
a
man
a
sentiment
surely
that
will
be
considered
as
true
now
as
it
ever
was
be
the
time
the
thirteenth
century
or
earlier
or
later
and
that
represents
the
best
solution
of
social
problems
that
has
ever
been
put
forward
nature
own
panacea
for
ills
that
other
remedies
at
best
only
palliate
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
carlyle
said
of
this
period
what
we
may
well
repeat
here
we
shall
suppose
that
this
literary
period
is
partially
known
to
all
readers
let
each
recall
whatever
he
has
learned
or
figures
regarding
it
represent
to
himself
that
brave
young
heyday
of
chivalry
and
minstrelsy
when
a
stern
barbarossa
a
stern
sang
sirventes
and
with
the
hand
that
could
wield
the
sword
and
sceptre
twanged
the
melodious
strings
when
tilted
and
ladies
eyes
rained
bright
influences
and
suddenly
as
at
sunrise
the
whole
earth
had
grown
vocal
and
musical
then
truly
was
the
time
of
singing
come
for
princes
and
prelates
emperors
and
squires
the
wise
and
the
simple
men
women
and
children
all
sang
and
rhymed
or
delighted
in
hearing
it
done
it
was
a
universal
noise
of
song
as
if
the
spring
of
manhood
had
arrived
and
warblings
from
every
spray
not
indeed
without
infinite
twitterings
also
which
except
their
gladness
had
no
music
were
bidding
it
welcome
this
is
the
keynote
of
the
century
song
blithesome
and
gay
as
the
birds
solemn
and
harmonious
as
the
organ
tones
that
accord
so
well
with
the
great
latin
hymns
everywhere
song
believers
says
tieck
the
great
collector
of
thirteenth
century
poetry
sang
of
faith
lovers
of
love
knights
described
knightly
actions
and
battles
and
loving
believing
knights
were
their
chief
audience
the
spring
beauty
gaiety
were
objects
that
could
never
tire
great
duels
and
deeds
of
arms
carried
away
every
hearer
the
more
surely
the
stronger
they
were
painted
and
as
the
pillars
and
dome
of
the
church
encircled
the
flock
so
did
religion
as
the
highest
encircle
poetry
and
reality
and
every
heart
in
equal
love
humbled
itself
before
her
the
names
of
the
meistersingers
are
to
musical
lovers
at
least
because
of
the
music
drama
of
that
name
and
the
famous
war
of
the
wartburg
the
most
familiar
of
all
of
them
is
doubtless
walter
von
der
vogelweide
who
when
he
was
asked
where
he
found
the
tuneful
melodies
for
his
songs
said
that
he
learned
them
from
the
birds
those
who
recall
longfellow
pretty
ballad
with
regard
to
walter
and
his
leaving
all
his
substance
to
feed
the
birds
over
his
grave
near
nuremberg
minster
towers
will
not
find
it
surprising
that
this
meistersinger
poetry
breathes
the
deepest
love
of
nature
and
that
there
is
in
it
a
lyric
quality
of
joy
in
the
things
of
nature
that
we
are
apt
to
think
of
as
modern
until
we
find
over
and
over
again
in
these
bards
that
the
spirit
of
the
woods
and
of
the
fields
and
of
the
spring
time
meant
as
much
for
them
as
for
any
follower
of
the
wordsworth
school
of
poetry
in
the
more
conscious
this
from
walter
with
regard
to
the
may
will
serve
to
illustrate
very
well
this
phase
of
his
work
gentle
may
thou
showerest
fairly
gifts
afar
and
near
clothest
all
the
woods
so
rarely
and
the
meadows

the
plain

me
from
my
sadness
love
me
while
is
may
mine
is
but
a
borrowed
gladness
if
thou
frown
alway
look
around
and
smile
anew
all
the
world
is
glad
and
free
let
a
little
joy
from
thee
fall
to
my
lot
too
walter
could
be
on
occasion
however
as
serious
as
any
of
the
meistersingers
and
is
especially
known
for
his
religious
poems
it
is
not
surprising
that
any
one
who
set
woman
on
so
high
a
pedestal
as
did
walter
should
have
written
beautiful
poems
to
the
blessed
virgin
he
was
the
first
so
it
is
said
to
express
the
sentiment
woman
god
bless
her
by
that
name
for
it
is
a
far
nobler
name
than
lady
occasionally
he
can
be
seriously
didactic
and
he
has
not
hesitated
even
to
express
some
sentiments
with
regard
to
methods
of
education
among
other
things
he
discusses
the
question
as
to
whether
children
should
be
whipped
or
not
in
the
process
of
education
and
curiously
enough
takes
the
very
modern
view
that
whipping
is
always
a
mistake
in
this
of
course
he
disagrees
with
all
the
practical
educators
of
his
time
who
considered
the
rod
the
most
effective
instrument
for
the
education
of
children
and
strictly
followed
the
scriptural
injunction
about
sparing
the
rod
and
spoiling
the
child
walter
opinion
is
for
that
reason
all
the
more
interesting
children
with
rod
ruling
is
the
worst
of
schooling
who
is
honor
made
to
know
him
a
word
seems
as
a
blow
the
birds
were
always
a
favorite
subject
for
poetic
inspiration
on
the
part
of
the
minnesingers
bird
music
rapt
poetic
souls
into
ecstasies
in
which
the
passage
of
time
was
utterly
unnoticed
it
is
from
the
thirteenth
century
that
comes
the
beautiful
legend
with
regard
to
the
monk
who
having
wondered
how
time
could
be
kept
from
dragging
in
heaven
was
permitted
to
listen
to
the
song
of
a
bird
one
day
in
the
forest
and
when
he
awoke
from
his
rapture
and
went
back
to
his
convent
found
that
a
hundred
years
had
passed
that
all
of
the
monks
of
his
acquaintance
were
dead
and
while
his
name
was
found
on
the
rolls
of
the
monastery
after
it
there
was
a
note
that
he
had
disappeared
one
day
and
had
never
been
heard
of
afterwards
almost
in
the
same
tenor
as
this
is
a
pretty
song
from
dietmar
von
eist
written
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
which
was
a
type
of
the
charming
songs
that
were
to
be
so
characteristic
of
the
times
there
sat
upon
the
a
bird
and
sung
its
strain
so
sweet
it
sung
that
as
i
heard
my
heart
went
back
again
it
went
to
one
remember
spot
it
saw
the
grow
and
thought
again
the
thoughts
of
love
there
cherished
long
ago
a
thousand
years
to
me
it
seems
since
by
my
fair
i
sate
yet
thus
to
be
a
stranger
long
is
not
my
choice
but
fate
since
then
i
have
not
seen
the
flowers
nor
heard
the
birds
sweet
song
my
joys
have
all
too
briefly
past
my
griefs
been
all
too
long
hartman
von
aue
was
a
contemporary
of
walter
and
is
best
known
for
his
romantic
stories
it
is
rather
curiously
interesting
to
find
that
one
of
the
old
chroniclers
considers
it
a
great
mark
of
distinction
that
though
hartman
was
a
knight
he
was
able
to
read
and
write
whatever
he
found
written
in
books
it
must
not
be
forgotten
however
that
not
all
of
these
poets
could
read
and
write
and
that
indeed
so
distinguished
a
literary
man
as
wolfram
von
eschenbach
the
author
of
percival
the
story
on
which
wagner
founded
his
opera
of
parsifal
could
neither
read
nor
write
he
had
developed
a
very
wonderful
memory
and
was
able
to
store
faithfully
his
poems
in
the
course
of
their
composition
so
that
he
was
above
the
need
of
pen
and
paper
hartman
is
most
famous
for
having
written
the
story
of
poor
henry
which
longfellow
has
chosen
so
effectively
for
his
golden
legend
hartman
appreciation
of
women
can
be
judged
from
the
following
lines
which
accord
her
an
equal
share
in
her
lord
glory
because
of
her
sufferings
in
prayer
at
home
glory
be
unto
her
whose
word
sends
her
dear
lord
to
bitter
fight
although
he
conquer
by
his
sword
she
to
the
praise
has
equal
right
he
with
the
sword
in
battle
she
at
home
with
prayer
both
win
the
victory
and
both
the
glory
share
occasionally
one
finds
as
we
have
said
among
the
little
songs
of
the
minnesingers
of
the
time
such
tuneful
trifles
as
could
be
included
very
appropriately
in
a
modern
collection
of
de
or
as
might
even
serve
as
a
love
message
on
a
modern
valentine
or
a
christmas
card
the
surprise
of
finding
such
things
at
such
a
time
will
justify
the
quotation
of
one
of
them
from
brother
wernher
who
owes
his
title
of
brother
not
to
his
membership
in
any
religious
order
very
probably
but
to
the
fact
that
he
belonged
to
the
brotherhood
of
the
poets
of
the
time
since
creation
i
was
thine
now
forever
thou
art
mine
i
have
shut
thee
fast

unknown

wolfram
von
eschenbach
was
the
chief
of
a
group
of
poets
who
at
the
close
of
the
twelfth
and
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
centuries
gathered
about
the
landgraf
hermann
of
thuringen
in
his
court
on
the
wartburg
at
the
foot
of
which
lies
eisenach
in
the
present
grand
duchy
of
they
shaped
tales
of
knightly
adventure
blended
with
reflection
spiritual
suggestion
and
a
grace
of
verse
that
represented
the
best
culture
of
the
court
and
did
not
address
itself
immediately
to
the
people
wolfram
was
a
younger
son
of
one
of
the
lower
noble
bavarian
families
settled
at
eschenbach
nine
miles
from
ausbach
in
middle
franconia
he
had
a
poor
little
home
of
his
own
wildenberg
but
went
abroad
to
seek
adventures
as
a
knight
and
tell
adventures
as
a
poet
welcome
to
great
lords
and
most
welcome
to
the
lavish
friend
of
poets
hermann
of
thuringen
at
whose
court
on
the
wartburg
he
remained
twenty
years
from
to
in
which
latter
year
his
parzival
was
finished
from
some
passages
in
his
poem
it
may
safely
be
inferred
that
he
was
happily
married
and
had
children
the
landgraf
hermann
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
ludwig
husband
of
elizabeth
we
can
not
ascribe
to
english
writers
alone
the
spiritualizing
of
the
grail
legends
when
there
is
wolfram
parzival
drawing
from
the
same
cycle
of
myths
a
noble
poem
of
the
striving
to
bind
earthly
knighthood
to
the
god
while
gawain
type
of
the
earthly
knight
wins
great
praise
in
love
and
chivalry
parzival
percival
finds
his
way
on
from
childhood
up
through
humble
searchings
of
the
spirit
till
he
is
ruler
in
the
kingdom
of
the
soul
where
he
designs
that
lohengrin
his
eldest
son
shall
be
his
successor
while
kardeiss
his
younger
son
has
rule
over
his
earthly
possessions
how
beautifully
the
minnesingers
could
enter
into
the
spirit
of
nature
and
at
the
same
time
how
much
the
spirit
of
spring
has
always
been
prone
to
appeal
to
poetic
sensibilities
may
be
judged
from
the
following
song
of
conrad
of
kirchberg
which
is
translated
very
closely
and
in
the
same
meter
as
the
original
old
high
german
poem
it
is
very
evident
that
none
of
the
spirit
of
spring
was
lost
on
this
poet
of
the
olden
time
nor
on
the
other
hand
that
any
possibility
of
poetic
expression
was
missed
by
him
there
is
a
music
in
the
lilt
of
the
verselets
eminently
suggestive
of
the
lyric
effect
that
the
new
birth
of
things
had
on
the
poet
himself
and
that
he
wished
to
convey
to
his
readers
of
this
however
every
one
must
judge
for
himself
and
so
we
give
the
poem

it

be

were
the
troubadours
whose
tuneful
trifles
sometimes
deserving
of
much
more
serious
consideration
than
the
application
of
such
a
term
to
them
would
seem
to
demand
have
come
down
to
us
though
the
centuries
one
of
the
best
known
of
these
is
arnaud
de
marveil
who
was
born
in
very
humble
circumstances
but
who
succeeded
in
raising
himself
by
his
poetic
genius
to
be
the
companion
of
ruling
princes
and
the
friend
of
the
high
nobility
among
the
provencals
he
has
been
called
the
great
master
of
love
though
this
is
a
name
which
petrarch
reserves
especially
for
arnaud
daniel
while
he
calls
marveil
the
less
famous
of
the
arnauds
an
example
of
his
work
as
the
poet
of
love
that
is
typical
of
what
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
favorite
mode
of
the
troubadour
poets

the

justly

thus

been
to
speak
thy
name
and
waken
thy
cheek
the
blush
of
modest
shame
an
example
of
the
love
of
nature
which
characterizes
some
of
arnaud
de
marveil
work
will
serve
to
show
how
thoroughly
he
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
and
how
much
all
the
sights
and
sounds
of
nature
found
an
echo
in
his
poetic
spirit
the
translation
of
this
as
of
the
preceding
specimen
from
arnaud
is
taken
from
the
english
edition
of
the
historical
view
of
the
literature
of
the
south
of
europe
by
sismondi
and
this
translation
we
owe
to
thomas
roscoe
the
well
known
author
of
the
life
of
lorenzo
the
magnificent
who
considering
that
sismondi
does
not
furnish
enough
of
specimens
of
this
troubadour
poet
inserts
the
following
verses
for
the
translation
of
which
he
acknowledges
himself
indebted
to
the
kindness
of
friends
a
modest
concealment
doubtless
of
his
own
work
oh
how
sweet
the
breeze
of
april
breathing
soft
as
may
draws
near
while
through
nights
of
tranquil
beauty
songs
of
gladness
meet
the
ear
every
bird
his
language
uttering
in
the
morning
pride
revelling
in
joy
and
gladness
by
his
happy
partner
side
when
around
me
all
is
smiling
when
to
life
the
young
birds
spring
thoughts
of
love
i
can
not
hinder
come
my

inspiriting

in
such
joy
to
bear
my
part
with
such
sounds
of
bliss
around
me
could
i
wear
a
sadden
heart
his
description
of
his
lady
love
is
another
example
of
his
worship
of
nature
in
a
different
strain
which
serves
to
show
that
a
exaggeration
of
the
qualities
of
his
lady
is
not
a
modern
development
of
belle
fairer
than
the
helen
lovelier
than
the
gay
teeth
and
lips

as
open
as
the

a
thing
so
fair

that
never
yet
another
lived
who
can
with
thee
compare
a
single
stanza
from
a
by
bertrand
de
born
will
show
better
than
any
amount
of
critical
appreciation
how
beautifully
he
can
treat
the
more
serious
side
of
love
while
the
troubadours
are
usually
said
to
have
sung
their
love
strains
in
less
serious
vein
than
their
german
brother
poets
of
the
north
this
has
the
ring
of
tenderness
and
truth
about
it
and
yet
is
not
in
these
qualities
very
different
from
others
of
his
songs
that
are
well
known
the
translation
we
have
chosen
is
that
made
by
roscoe
who
has
rendered
a
number
of
the
songs
of
the
troubadours
into
english
verse
that
presents
an
excellent
equivalent
of
the
original
bertrand
is
insisting
with
his
that
she
must
not
listen
to
the
rumors
she
may
hear
from
others
with
regard
to
his
faithfulness
i
can
not
hide
from
thee
how
much
i
fear
the
whispers
breathed
by
flatterers
in
thine
ear
against
my
faith
but
turn
not
oh
i
pray
that
heart
so
true
so
faithful
so
sincere
so
humble
and
so
frank
to
me
so
dear
oh
lady
turn
it
not
from
me
away
at
times
one
is
surprised
to
find
pretty
tributes
to
nature
even
in
the
midst
of
songs
that
are
devoted
to
war
the
two
things
that
were
nearest
the
hearts
of
these
troubadour
poets
were
war
and
their
but
the
beauties
of
nature
became
mixed
up
not
only
with
their
love
songs
but
also
with
their
battle
hymns
or
at
least
with
their
ardent
descriptions
of
military
preparations
and
the
glories
of
war
an
excellent
example
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
following
stanza
written
by
william
of
saint
gregory
a
troubadour
who
is
best
known
for
his
songs
of
war
rather
than
of
tenderness
the
beautiful
spring
delights
me
well
when
flowers
and
leaves
are
growing
and
it
pleases
my
heart
to
hear
the
swell
of
the
birds
sweet
chorus
flowing
in
the
echoing
wood
and
i
love
to
see
all
scattered
around
pavilions

and
my
spirit
finds
it
good
to
see
on
the
level

beyond
gay
knights
and
steeds
caparison
occasionally
the
troubadours
indulge
in
religious
poetry
though
usually
not
of
a
mystical
or
profoundly
devotional
character
even
the
famous
peyrols
who
is
so
well
known
for
his
love
songs
sometimes
wandered
into
religious
poetry
that
was
not
unworthy
to
be
placed
beside
his
lyric
effusions
on
other
topics
peyrols
is
best
known
perhaps
for
his
lamentations
over
king
richard
the
lion
heart
fate
for
he
had
been
with
that
monarch
on
the
crusade
and
like
most
of
the
troubadours
who
went
with
the
army
drank
in
deep
admiration
for
the
poetic
king
after
his
visit
to
the
holy
land
on
this
occasion
one
stanza
of
his
song
in

one
of
the
most
precious
bequests
of
the
thirteenth
century
to
all
the
succeeding
centuries
is
undoubtedly
the
great
latin
hymns
these
sublime
religious
poems
comparable
only
to
the
hebrew
psalms
for
their
wondrous
expression
of
the
awe
and
devotion
of
religious
feeling
present
the
beginnings
of
rhymed
poetry
yet
they
have
been
acclaimed
by
competent
modern
critics
as
among
the
greatest
poems
that
ever
came
from
the
mind
of
man
they
come
to
us
from
this
period
and
were
composed
most
of
them
at
least
during
the
thirteenth
century
itself
a
few
shortly
before
it
though
all
of
them
received
during
this
century
the
stamp
of
ecclesiastical
and
popular
approval
which
made
them
for
many
centuries
afterward
the
principal
medium
of
the
expression
of
congregational
devotion
and
the
exemplar
and
incentive
for
vernacular
poetry
it
is
from
these
latter
standpoints
that
they
deserve
the
attention
of
all
students
of
literature
quite
apart
from
their
significance
as
great
expressions
of
the
mind
of
these
wondrous
generations
these
latin
hymns
have
sometimes
been
spoken
of
with
perhaps
a
certain
degree
of
contempt
as
rhymed
latin
poetry
as
if
the
use
of
rhyme
in
conjunction
with
latin
somehow
lowered
the
dignity
of
the
grand
old
tongue
in
which
cicero
wrote
his
graceful
periods
and
horace
sang
his
tuneful
odes
as
a
matter
of
fact
far
from
detracting
from
the
beauties
of
latin
expression
these
hymns
have
added
new
laurels
to
the
glory
of
the
language
and
have
shown
the
wonderful
possibilities
of
the
roman
speech
in
the
hands
of
generations
long
after
the
classical
period
if
they
served
no
other
purpose
than
to
demonstrate
beyond
cavil
how
profoundly
the
scholars
of
this
generation
succeeded
in
possessing
themselves
of
the
genius
of
the
latin
language
they
would
serve
to
contradict
the
foolish
critics
who
talk
of
the
education
of
the
period
as
superficial
or
as
negligent
of
everything
but
scholastic
philosophy
and
theology
at
least
one
distinguished
philologist
professor
a
march
who
has
now
for
the
better
part
of
half
a
century
occupied
the
chair
of
comparative
philology
at
lafayette
college
does
not
hesitate
to
say
that
the
latin
hymns
represent
an
expression
of
the
genius
of
the
latin
people
and
language
more
characteristic
than
the
classical
poetry
even
of
the
golden
or
silver
ages
these
hymns
he
says
were
the
first
original
poetry
of
the
people
in
the
latin
language
unless
perhaps
those
latin
critics
may
be
right
who
think
they
find
in
livy
a
prose
rendering
of
earlier
ballads
the
classic
poetry
was
an
echo
of
greece
both
in
substance
and
in
form
the
matter
and
meters
were
both
imitated
and
the
poems
were
composed
for
the
lovers
of
grecian
art
in
the
roman
court
it
did
not
spring
from
the
people
but
the
christian
hymns
were
proper
folk
poetry
the
bible
of
the
people
their
homeric
poems
their
making
was
not
so
much
speech
as
action
they
were
in
substance
festive
prayers
the
simplest
rhythmic
offering
of
thanks
and
praise
to
the
giver
of
light
and
of
rest
both
natural
and
spiritual
at
morning
and
evening
and
at
other
seasons
suited
to
the
remembrance
and
rhythmical
rehearsal
of
the
truths
of
the
bible
march
opinion
has
been
echoed
by
many
another
enthusiastic
student
of
these
wonderful
hymns
it
is
only
those
who
do
not
know
them
who
fail
to
grow
enthusiastic
about
them
this
of
itself
would
stamp
these
great
poems
as
worthy
of
careful
study
there
is
however
an
additional
reason
for
modern
interest
in
them
these
hymns
were
sung
by
the
whole
congregation
at
the
many
services
that
they
attended
in
the
medieval
period
in
this
regard
it
seems
well
to
recall
that
it
was
the
custom
to
go
to
church
much
oftener
then
than
at
present
besides
the
sundays
there
were
many
holy
days
of
obligation
that
is
religious
festivals
on
which
attendance
at
church
was
obligatory
and
in
addition
a
certain
number
of
days
of
devotion
on
which
because
of
special
reverence
for
some
particular
saint
or
in
celebration
of
some
event
in
the
life
of
the
lord
or
his
saints
the
people
of
special
parts
of
the
country
found
themselves
drawn
to
attendance
on
church
services
it
seems
probable
that
instead
of
the
sixty
or
so
times
a
year
that
is
now
obligatory
people
went
to
church
during
the
thirteenth
century
more
than
a
hundred
times
in
the
year
twice
a
week
then
at
least
there
was
the
uplifting
cultural
influence
of
this
congregational
singing
of
wonderful
hymns
that
are
among
the
greatest
poems
ever
written
and
that
belong
to
literature
of
the
very
highest
order
the
educational
value
of
such
intimate
contact
with
what
is
best
in
literary
expression
could
scarcely
fail
to
have
a
distinct
effect
upon
the
people
it
is
idle
to
say
that
the
hymns
being
in
latin
they
were
not
understood
since
the
language
of
them
was
close
akin
to
the
spoken
tongues
the
subjects
were
eminently
familiar
mysteries
of
religion
and
constant
repetition
and
frequent
explanation
must
have
led
to
a
very
general
comprehension
even
by
the
least
educated
classes
for
anyone
with
any
pretension
to
education
they
must
have
been
easy
to
understand
since
latin
was
practically
a
universal
language
it
is
not
always
realized
by
the
students
whose
interests
have
been
mainly
confined
to
modern
literature
in
what
estimation
these
latin
hymns
have
been
held
by
those
who
are
in
the
best
position
to
be
able
to
judge
critically
of
their
value
as
poetry
take
for
example
the
dies
irae
confessedly
the
greatest
of
them
and
it
will
be
found
that
many
of
the
great
poets
and
literary
men
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
counted
it
among
their
favorite
poems
such
men
as
goethe
friedrich
and
august
schlegel
scott
milman
and
archbishop
trench
were
enthusiastic
in
its
praise
while
such
geniuses
as
dryden
johnson
and
jeremy
taylor
and
the
musicians
mozart
and
hayden
avowed
supreme
admiration
for
it
herder
fichte
and
august
schlegel
besides
crashaw
drummond
roscommon
trench
and
macaulay
gave
the
proof
of
their
appreciation
of
the
great
thirteenth
century
hymn
by
devoting
themselves
to
making
translations
of
it
and
goethe
use
of
it
in
faust
and
scott
in
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
show
how
much
poets
whose
sympathies
were
not
involved
in
its
religious
aspects
were
caught
by
its
literary
and
esthetic
merit
in
very
recent
times
the
latin
hymns
have
been
coming
more
to
their
own
again
and
such
distinguished
critics
as
henry
morley
and
george
saintsbury
have
not
hesitated
to
express
their
critical
appreciation
of
these
hymns
as
great
literature

the

have
been

more

no

wonderful
thing
after

are
perhaps
the
extreme
examples

that
cheap
and
despicable
paradox
which
thinks
to
escape
the
charge
of

docility
by
the
affectation
of
heterodox
independence
the
judgment
of
the
greatest
and
not
always
of
the
most
pious
men
of
letters
of
modern
times
may
confirm
those
who
are
uncomfortable
without
authority
in
a
different
opinion
fortunately
there
is
not
likely
ever
to
be
lack
of
those

wonderful

or
another
as
nearly
or
quite
the
most
perfect
wedding
of
sound
to
sense
that
they
know
this
seems
almost
the
limit
of
praise
but
saintsbury
can
say
even
more
than
this
it
would
be
possible
indeed
to
illustrate
a
complete
dissertation
on
the
methods
of
expression
in
serious
poetry
from
the
lines
of
the
dies
irae
rhyme
alliteration
cadence
and
adjustment
of
vowel
and
consonant
values
all
these
things
receive
perfect
expression
in
it
or
at
least
in
the
first
thirteen
stanzas
for
the
last
four
are
a
little
inferior
it
is
quite
astonishing
to
reflect
upon
the
careful
art
or
the
felicitous
accident
of
such
a
line
as
tuba
mirum
spargens
sonum
with
the
thud
of
the
trochee
falling
in
each
instance
in
a
different
vowel
and
still
more
on
the
continuous
sequence
of
five
stanzas

no
poet
could
say
that
any
effect
of
poetry
was
as
far
as
sound
goes
unattainable
though
few
could
have
hoped
to
equal
it
and
perhaps
no
one
except
dante
and
shakespeare
has
fully
done
so
higher
praise
than
this
could
scarcely
be
given
and
it
comes
from
an
acknowledged
authority
whose
interests
are
moreover
in
secular
rather
than
religious
literature
and
whose
enthusiastic
praise
is
therefore
all
the
more
striking
here
in
america
schaff
whose
critical
judgment
in
religious
literature
is
unquestionable
and
whose
sympathies
with
the
old
church
and
her
hymns
were
not
as
deep
as
if
he
had
been
a
roman
catholic
has
been
quite
as
unstinted
in
laudation
this
marvelous
hymn
is
the
acknowledged
masterpiece
of
latin
poetry
and
the
most
sublime
of
all
uninspired
hymns
the
secret
of
its
irresistible
power
lies
in
the
awful
grandeur
of
the
theme
the
intense
earnestness
and
pathos
of
the
poet
the
simple
majesty
and
solemn
music
of
its
language
the
stately
meter
the
triple
rhyme
and
the
vowel
assonances
chosen
in
striking
adaptation
to
the
sense
all
combining
to
produce
an
overwhelming
effect
as
if
we
heard
the
final
crash
of
the
universe
the
commotion
of
the
opening
graves
the
trumpet
of
the
archangel
summoning
the
quick
and
the
dead
and
saw
the
of
tremendous
majesty
seated
on
the
throne
of
justice
and
of
mercy
and
ready
to
dispense
everlasting
life
and
everlasting
woe
neale
says
of
thomas
aquinas
great
hymn
the
pange
lingua
this
hymn
contests
the
second
place
among
those
of
the
western
church
with
the
regis
the
mater
the
dulcis
memoria
the
regias
agni
dapes
the
supernam
and
one
or
two
others
leaving
the
irae
in
its
unapproachable
glory
thus
furnishing
another
supreme
testimony
to
the
hymn
we
have
been
discussing
which
indeed
only
needs
to
be
read
to
be
appreciated
since
it
will
inevitably
tempt
to
successive
readings
and
these
bring
with
them
ever
and
ever
increasing
admiration
showing
in
this
more
than
in
any
other
way
that
it
is
a
work
of
sublime
genius
with
regard
to
rhyme
particularly
the
triumph
of
art
and
the
influence
of
the
latin
hymns
is
undoubted
this
latest
beauty
of
poetry
reached
its
perfection
of
expression
in
the
latin
hymns
it
is
rather
curious
to
trace
its
gradual
development
it
constitutes
the
only
feature
of
literature
which
apparently
did
not
come
to
us
from
the
east
the
earlier
specimens
of
poetry
of
which
we
know
anything
among
the
oriental
nations
other
than
the
hebrews
are
beautiful
examples
of
the
possibilities
of
rhythm
and
the
beginnings
of
meter
as
poetry
goes
westward
meter
becomes
as
important
as
rhythm
in
poetry
and
these
two
qualities
differentiated
it
from
prose
both
of
these
literary
modes
however
are
eastern
in
origin
rhyme
comes
from
the
distant
west
and
seems
to
have
originated
in
the
alliteration
invented
by
the
celtic
bards
the
vowel
assonance
was
after
a
time
completed
by
the
addition
of
consonantal
assonance
and
then
the
invention
of
rhyme
was
completed
the
first
fully
rhymed
hymns
seem
to
have
been
written
by
the
irish
monks
and
carried
over
to
the
continent
by
them
on
their
christianizing
expeditions
after
the
irruption
of
the
barbarians
had
obliterated
the
civilization
of
europe
during
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
rhyme
developed
mainly
in
connection
with
ecclesiastical
poetry
during
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
it
reached
an
acme
of
evolution
which
has
never
been
surpassed
during
all
the
succeeding
generations
it
must
not
be
thought
that
because
so
much
attention
is
given
to
the
dies
irae
this
constitutes
the
only
supremely
great
hymn
of
the
thirteenth
century
there
are
at
least
five
or
six
others
that
well
deserve
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
one
of
them
the
famous
stabat
mater
of
jacopone
da
todi
has
been
considered
by
some
critics
as
quite
as
beautiful
as
the
dies
irae
in
poetic
expression
though
below
it
as
poetry
because
of
the
lesser
sublimity
of
its
subject
certainly
no
more
marvelously
poetic
expression
of
all
that
is
saddest
in
human
sorrow
has
ever
been
put
into
words
than
that
which
is
to
be
found
in
these
stanzas
of
the
franciscan
monk
who
had
himself
known
all
the
depths
of
human
sorrow
and
trial
most
people
know
the
opening
stanzas
of
it
well
enough
to
scarce
need
their
presentation
and
yet
it
is
from
the
poem
itself
and
not
from
any
critical
appreciation
of
it
that
its
greatness
must
be
judged

have
been
many
translations
of

most
of

done
by
poets
whose

work

who
were
accomplishing

labors

one
of
the
most
beautiful
translations
is
undoubtedly
that
by
denis
florence
maccarthy
who
has
been
hailed
as
probably
the
best
translator
into
english
of
foreign
poetry
that
our
generation
has
known
and
whose
translations
of

present
the
greatest
of
spanish

in
a
dress
as
worthy
of
the
original
as
it
is
possible
for
a

to
have
in
a
foreign
tongue
maccarthy
has
succeeded
in
following
the
intricate
rhyme
plan
of
the
stabat
with
a
perfection
that
would
be
deemed
almost
impossible
in
our
harsher
english
which
does
not
readily
yield
itself
to
double
rhymes
and
which
permits
frequency
of
rhyme
as
a
rule
only
at
the
sacrifice
of
vigor
of
expression
the
first
three
stanzas
however
of
the
stabat

will
serve
to
show
how
well
maccarthy
accomplished
his
difficult
task
by
the
cross
on
which
suspended
with
his
bleeding
hands
extended
hung
that

so
adored

the

made
by
the
distinguished

the

the

even
distinguished
professors
of
philosophy
and
theology
occasionally
indulged
themselves
in
the
privilege
of
writing
these
latin
hymns
and
what
is
more
surprising
succeeded
in
making
poetry
of
a
very
high
order
at
least
two
of
the
most
distinguished
professors
in
these
branches
at
the
university
of
paris
in
the
latter
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
must
be
acknowledged
as
having
written
hymns
that
are
confessedly
immortal
not
because
of
any
canonical
usage
that
keeps
them
alive
but
because
they
express
in
very
different
ways
in
wondrously
beautiful
language
some
of
the
sublimest
religious
thoughts
of
their
time
these
two
are
bonaventure
the
franciscan
and
thomas
of
aquin
the
dominican
bonaventure
hymns
on
the
passion
and
cross
of
christ
represent
what
has
been
most
beautifully
sung
on
these
subjects
in
all
the
ages
thomas
poetic
work
centers
around
the
blessed
sacrament
in
whose
honor
he
was
so
ardent
and
so
devoted
that
the
composition
of
the
office
for
its
feast
was
confided
to
him
by
the
pope
the
hymns
he
wrote
far
from
being
the
series
of
prosy
theological
formulas
that
might
have
been
expected
perhaps
under
such
circumstances
are
great
contributions
to
a
form
of
literature
which
contains
more
gems
of
purest
ray
in
its
collection
than
almost
any
other
thomas
poetic
jewels
shine
with
no
borrowed
radiance
and
their
effulgence
is
not
cast
into
shadow
even
by
the
greatest
of
their
companion
pieces
among
the
latin
hymns
of
a
wonderfully
productive
century
neale
tribute
to
one
of
them
has
already
been
quoted
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
chapter
it
has
indeed
been
considered
almost
miraculous
that
this
profoundest
of
thinkers
should
have
been
able
to
attain
within
the
bounds
of
rhyme
and
rhythm
the
accurate
expression
of
some
of
the
most
intricate
theological
thoughts
that
have
ever
been
expressed
and
yet
should
have
accomplished
his
purpose
with
a
clarity
of
language
a
simplicity
and
directness
of
words
a
poetic
sympathy
of
feeling
and
an
utter
devotion
that
make
his
hymns
great
literature
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
one
of
them
at
least
the
pange
lingua
gloriosi
has
been
in
constant
use
in
the
church
ever
since
his
time
and
its
two
last
stanzas
beginning
with
tantum
ergo
sacramentum
are
perhaps
the
most
familiar
of
all
the
latin
hymns
few
of
those
most
familiar
with
it
realize
its
place
in
literature
the
greatness
of
its
author
or
its
own
marvelous
poetic
merits
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
at
the
very
time
when
these
hymns
were
most
popular
the
modern
languages
were
just
assuming
shape
even
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
none
of
them
had
reached
anything
like
the
form
that
it
was
to
continue
to
hold
except
perhaps
the
italian
and
to
some
extent
the
spanish
when
dante
wrote
his
divine
comedy
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
he
was
tempted
to
use
the
latin
language
the
common
language
of
all
the
scholars
of
his
day
and
the
language
ordinarily
used
for
any
ambitious
literary
project
for
nearly
a
century
later
it
will
not
be
forgotten
that
when
petrarch
in
the
fourteenth
century
wrote
his
epic
africa
on
which
he
expected
his
fame
as
a
poet
to
rest
he
preferred
to
use
the
latin
language
fortunately
dante
was
large
enough
of
mind
to
realize
that
the
vulgar
tongue
of
the
italians
would
prove
the
best
instrument
for
the
expression
of
the
thoughts
he
wished
to
communicate
and
so
he
cast
the
italian
language
into
the
mold
in
which
it
has
practically
ever
since
remained
his
very
hesitation
however
shows
how
incomplete
as
yet
were
these
modern
languages
considered
by
the
scholars
who
used
them
it
was
at
this
very
formative
period
however
that
the
people
on
whose
use
of
the
nascent
modern
languages
their
future
character
depended
were
having
dinned
into
their
ears
in
the
numerous
church
services
the
great
latin
hymns
with
their
wonderful
finish
of
expression
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
effective
factors
of
whatever
of
sweetness
there
is
in
the
modern
tongues
must
be
attributed
to
this
influence
exerted
all
unconsciously
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
the
rhythm
and
the
expressiveness
of
these
magnificent
poems
could
scarcely
fail
to
stamp
itself
to
some
degree
upon
the
language
crude
though
it
might
be
of
the
people
who
had
become
so
familiar
with
them
it
is
then
to
no
small
extent
because
of
the
influence
of
these
latin
hymns
that
our
modern
languages
possess
a
rhythmic
melodiousness
that
in
time
enabled
them
to
become
the
instruments
for
poetic
diction
in
such
a
way
as
to
satisfy
all
the
requirements
of
the
modern
ear
in
rhyme
and
rhythm
and
meter
a
striking
corresponding
effect
upon
the
exactness
of
expression
in
the
modern
languages
it
will
be
noticed
is
pointed
out
in
the
chapter
on
the
prose
of
the
century
as
representing
according
to
professor
saintsbury
the
greatest
benefit
that
was
derived
from
the
exaggerated
practise
of
dialectic
disputation
in
the
curriculum
of
the
medieval
universities
those
who
would
think
that
the
thirteenth
century
was
happy
in
creative
genius
but
lacking
in
the
critical
faculty
that
would
enable
it
to
select
the
best
not
only
of
the
hymns
presented
by
its
own
generations
but
also
of
those
which
came
from
the
preceding
centuries
should
make
themselves
acquainted
with
the
history
of
these
latin
hymns
just
before
the
thirteenth
century
the
monks
of
the
famous
abbey
of
victor
took
up
the
writing
of
hymns
with
wonderful
success
and
two
of
them
adam
and
hugh
became
not
only
the
favorites
of
their
own
but
of
succeeding
generations
the
thirteenth
century
received
the
work
of
these
men
and
gave
them
a
vogue
which
has
continued
down
to
our
own
time
some
of
the
hymns
that
were
thus
acclaimed
and
made
popular
are
among
the
greatest
contributions
to
this
form
of
literature
and
while
they
have
had
periods
of
eclipse
owing
to
bad
taste
in
the
times
that
followed
the
reputation
secured
during
the
thirteenth
century
has
always
been
sufficient
to
recall
them
to
memory
and
bring
men
again
to
a
realization
of
their
beauty
when
a
more
esthetic
generation
came
into
existence
one
of
the
hymns
of
the
immediately
preceding
time
which
attained
great
popularity
during
the
thirteenth
century
a
popularity
that
reflects
credit
on
those
among
whom
it
is
noted
as
well
as
upon
the
great
hymn
itself
was
bernard
of
cluny
or
bernard

concerning
the
contempt
of
the
world

of
the
ideas

were
to
be
used
freely
in
the
book
bearing
this
title
written
by
the
first
pope
of
the
century
innocent
iii
whose
name
is
usually
though
gratuitously
associated
with
quite
other
ideas
than
those
of
contempt
for
worldly
grandeur
the
description
of
the
new
jerusalem
to
come
which
is
found
at
the
beginning
of
this
great
poem
is
the
basis
of
all
the
modern
religious
poems
on
this
subject
few
hymns
have
been
more
praised
schaff
in
his
christ
in
song
says
this
glowing
description
is
the
sweetest
of
all
the
new
jerusalem
hymns
of
heavenly
homesickness
which
have
taken
their
inspiration
from
the
last
two
chapters
of
revelation
the
extreme
difficulty
of
the
meter
which
its
author
selected
and
which
would
seem
almost
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
expressing
great
connected
thought
especially
in
so
long
a
poem
became
under
the
master
hand
of
this
poetic
genius
whose
command
of
the
latin
language
is
unrivaled
the
source
of
new
beauties
for
his
poem
besides
maintaining
the
meter
of
the
old
latin
hexameters
he
added
double
rhymes
in
each
line
and
yet
had
every
alternate
line
also
end
in
a
rhyme

appreciate

itself

that
doctor
neale
is
justified
in
his
enthusiastic
opinion
that
it
is
the
most
lovely
in
the
same
way
that
the
dies

is
the
most
sublime

the

the
most
pathetic
of
medieval
poems
while
it
scarcely
has
a
place
here
properly
a
word
must
be
said
with
regard
to
the
music
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
might
possibly
be
thought
that
these
wondrous
rhymes
had
been
spoiled
in
their
effectiveness
by
the
crude
music
to
which
they
were
set
to
harbor
any
such
notion
however
would
only
be
another
exhibition
of
that
intellectual
snobbery
which
concludes
that
generations
so
distant
could
not
have
anything
worth
the
consideration
of
our
more
developed
time
the
music
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
as
great
a
triumph
as
any
other
feature
of
its
accomplishment
it
would
be
clearly
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
people
who
created
the
cathedrals
and
made
every
element
associated
with
the
church
ceremonial
so
beautiful
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
all
generations
since
could
have
failed
to
develop
a
music
suitable
to
these
magnificent
fanes
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
more
suitable
music
for
congregational
singing
than
the
gregorian
chant
which
reached
the
acme
of
its
development
in
the
thirteenth
century
has
been
invented
and
the
fact
that
the
catholic
church
after
having
tried
modern
music
is
now
going
back
to
this
medieval
musical
mode
for
devotional
expression
is
only
a
further
noteworthy
tribute
to
the
enduring
character
of
another
phase
of
thirteenth
century
accomplishment
rockstro
who
wrote
the
article
on
plain
chant
for
grove
dictionary
of
music
and
for
the
encyclopedia
britannica
declared
that
no
more
wonderful
succession
of
single
notes
had
even
been
strung
into
melodies
so
harmoniously
adapted
to
the
expression
of
the
words
with
which
they
were
to
be
sung
than
some
of
these
plain
chants
of
the
middle
ages
and
especially
of
the
thirteenth
century
no
more
sublimely
beautiful
musical
expression
of
all
the
depths
there
are
in
sadness
has
ever
found
its
way
into
music
than
what
is
so
simply
expressed
in
the
lamentations
as
they
are
sung
in
the
office
called
tenebrae
during
holy
week
even
more
beautiful
in
its
joyousness
is
the
marvelous
melody
of
the
exultet
which
is
sung
in
the
office
of
holy
saturday
this
latter
is
said
to
be
the
sublimest
expression
of
joyful
sound
that
has
ever
come
from
the
human
heart
and
mind
in
a
word
in
music
as
in
every
other
artistic
department
the
men
of
the
thirteenth
century
reached
a
standard
that
has
never
been
excelled
and
that
remains
to
the
present
day
as
a
source
of
pleasure
and
admiration
for
intellectual
men
and
will
continue
to
be
so
for
numberless
generations
yet
unborn
nor
must
it
be
thought
that
the
thirteenth
century
men
and
women
were
satisfied
with
church
music
alone
about
the
middle
of
the
century
part
singing
came
into
use
in
the
churches
at
the
less
formal
ceremonials
and
soon
spread
to
secular
uses
as
the
mystery
plays
gave
rise
to
the
modern
drama
so
church
music
gave
birth
to
the
popular
music
of
the
time
in
england
particularly
about
the
middle
of
the
century
various
glee
songs
were
sung
portions
of
which
have
come
down
to
us
and
a
great
movement
of
folk
music
was
begun
before
the
end
of
the
century
the
interaction
of
church
and
secular
music
had
given
rise
to
many
of
the
modes
of
modern
musical
development
and
the
musical
movement
was
as
substantially
begun
as
were
any
of
the
other
great
artistic
and
intellectual
movements
which
this
century
so
marvelously
initiated
this
subject
of
course
is
of
the
kind
that
needs
to
be
studied
in
special
works
if
any
satisfactory
amount
of
information
is
to
be
obtained
but
even
the
passing
hint
of
it
which
we
have
been
able
to
give
will
enable
the
reader
to
realize

books
were

than

thirteenth

from

which
contrary
to

in

were
frequently
the
subject
of
study
and
of
almost
daily
contact
in
one
way
or
another
by
all
classes
of
people
these
three
books
were
reynard
the
fox
that
is
the
series
of
stories
of
the
animals
in
which
they
are
used
as
a
cloak
for
a
satire
upon
man
and
his
ways
called
often
the
animal
epic
the
golden
legend
which
impressed
longfellow
so
much
that
he
spent
many
years
making
what
he
hoped
might
prove
for
the
modern
world
a
bit
of
the
that
this
wonderful
old
medieval
book
has
been
for
its
own
and
subsequent
generations
and
finally
the
romance
of
the
rose
probably
the
most
read
book
during
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
and
most
of
the
fifteenth
centuries
in
all
the
countries
of
europe
its
popularity
can
be
well
appreciated
from
the
fact
that
though
chaucer
was
much
read
there
are
more
than
three
times
as
many
manuscript
copies
of
the
romance
of
the
rose
in
existence
as
of

it
was
one
of
the

it
was
a
favorite
occupation
some
few
years
ago
to
pick
out
what
were
considered
the
ten
best
books
sir
john
lubbock
first
suggested
that
it
would
be
an
interesting
thing
to
pick
out
the
ten
books
which
if
one
were
to
be
confined
for
life
should
be
thought
the
most
likely
to
be
of
enduring
interest
if
this
favorite
game
were
to
be
played
with
the
selection
limited
to
the
authors
of
a
single
century
it
is
reasonably
sure
that
most
educated
people
would
pick
out
the
thirteenth
century
group
of
ten
for
their
exclusive
reading
for
the
rest
of
life
rather
than
any
other
an
experimental
list
of
ten
books
selected
from
the
thirteenth
century
writers
would
include
the
cid
the
legends
of
king
arthur
the
nibelungen
lied
the
romance
of
the
rose
reynard
the
fox
the
golden

the

perceval
by
wolfram
von
eschenbach
durandus
symbolism
and
dante
as
will
readily
be
appreciated
by
anyone
who
knows
literature
well
these
are
eminently
books
of
enduring
interest
when
it
is
considered
that
in
making
this
list
no
call
is
made
upon
icelandic
literature
nor
provençal
literature
both
of
which
are
of
supreme
interest
and
both
reached
their
maturity
at
this
time
the
abounding
literary
wealth
of
the
century
will
be
understood
it
has
become
the
fashion
in
recent
years
to
take
the
pains
from
time
to
time
to
find
out
which
are
the
most
read
books
the
criterion
of
worth
thus
set
up
is
not
very
valuable
for
unfortunately
for
the
increase
in
readers
there
has
not
come
a
corresponding
demand
for
the
best
books
nor
for
solid
literature
the
fact
that
a
book
has
been
the
best
seller
or
the
most
read
for
a
time
usually
stamps
it
at
once
as
trivial
or
at
most
as
being
of
quite
momentary
interest
and
not
at
all
likely
to
endure
it
is
all
the
more
interesting
to
find
then
that
these
three
most
read
books
of
the
thirteenth
century
have
not
only
more
than
merely
academic
interest
at
the
present
time
but
that
they
are
literature
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
they
have
always
been
not
only
a
means
of
helping
people
to
pass
the
time
the
sad
office
to
which
the
generality
of
books
has
been
reduced
in
our
time
but
a
source
of
inspiration
for
literary
men
in
many
generations
since
they
first
became
popular
the
story
of
reynard
the
fox
is
one
of
the
most
profoundly
humorous
books
that
was
ever
written
its
satire
was
aimed
at
its
own
time
yet
it
is
never
for
a
moment
antiquated
for
the
modern
reader
at
a
time
when
owing
to
the
imperfect
development
of
personal
rights
it
would
have
been
extremely
dangerous
to
satirize
as
the
author
does
very
freely
the
rulers
the
judges
the
nobility
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
and
churchmen
and
practically
all
classes
of
society
the
writer
whose
name
has
unfortunately
for
the
completeness
of
literary
history
not
come
down
to
us
succeeded
in
painting
all
the
foibles
of
men
and
pointing
out
all
the
differences
there
are
between
men
pretensions
and
their
actual
accomplishments
all
the
methods
by
which
the
cunning
scoundrel
could
escape
justice
are
exploited
the
various
modes
of
escaping
punishment
by
direct
and
indirect
bribery
by
pretended
repentance
and
reformation
by
cunning
appeal
to
the
selfishness
of
judges
are
revealed
with
the
fidelity
to
detail
of
a
modern
muckraker
yet
all
of
it
with
a
humanly
humorous
quality
which
while
it
takes
away
nothing
from
the
completeness
of
the
exposure
removes
most
of
the
bitterness
that
probably
would
have
made
the
satire
fail
of
its
purpose
while
every
class
in
the
community
of
the
time
comes
in
for
satirical
allusions
that
give
us
a
better
idea
of
how
closely
the
men
and
the
women
of
the
time
resembled
those
of
our
own
than
is
to
be
found
in
any
other
single
literary
work
that
has
been
preserved
for
us
from
this
century
or
indeed
any
other
the
series
of
stories
seemed
to
be
scarcely
more
than
a
collection
of
fables
for
children
and
probably
was
read
quite
unsuspectingly
by
those
who
are
so
unmercifully
satirized
in
it
though
doubtless
as
is
usually
noted
in
such
cases
each
one
may
have
applied
the
satire
of
the
story
as
he
saw
it
to
his
neighbor
and
not
to
himself
a
recent
editor
has
said
very
well
of
reynard
the
fox
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
universal
of
books
in
its
interest
for
all
classes
critics
have
at
all
times
been
ready
to
praise
and
few
if
any
have
found
fault
it
is
one
of
the
books
that
answers
well
to
what
cardinal
newman
declared
to
be
at
least
the
accidental
definition
of
a
classic
it
pleases
in
childhood
in
youth
in
middle
age
and
even
in
declining
years
it
is
because
of
the
eternal
verity
of
the
humanity
in
the
book
that
with
so
much
truth
froude
writing
of
reynard
can
say
it
is
not
addressed
to
a
passing
mode
of
folly
or
of
profligacy
but
it
touches
the
perennial
nature
of
mankind
laying
bare
our
own
sympathies
and
tastes
and
weaknesses
with
as
keen
and
true
an
edge
as
when
the
living
world
of
the
old
suabian
poet
winced
under
its
earliest
utterance
the
writer
who
traced
the
portraits
must
be
counted
one
of
the
great
observers
of
all
time
as
is
the
case
with
so
many
creative
artists
of
the
thirteenth
century
though
this
is
truer
elsewhere
than
in
literature
the
author
is
not
known
perhaps
he
thought
it
safer
to
shroud
his
identity
in
friendly
obscurity
rather
than
expose
himself
to
the
risks
the
finding
of
supposed
keys
to
his
satire
might
occasion
too
much
credit
must
not
be
given
to
this
explanation
however
though
some
writers
have
made
material
out
of
it
to
exploit
church
intolerance
which
the
conditions
do
not
justify
we
are
not
sure
who
wrote
the
arthur
legends
we
do
not
know
the
author
of
the
cid
even
german
scholarship
has
not
settled
the
problem
of
the
writer
of
the
nibelungen
and
the
authorship
of
the
dies
irae
is
in
doubt
though
all
of
these
would
be
sources
of
honor
and
praise
rather
than
danger
authors
had
evidently
not
as
yet
become
sophisticated
to
the
extent
of
seeking
immortality
for
their
works
they
even
seem
to
have
been
indifferent
as
to
whether
their
names
were
associated
with
them
or
not
enough
for
them
apparently
to
have
had
the
satisfaction
of
doing
all
else
seemed
futile
the
original
of
reynard
the
fox
was
probably
written
in
the
netherlands
though
it
may
be
somewhat
difficult
for
the
modern
mind
to
associate
so
much
of
wit
and
humor
with
the
dutchmen
of
the
middle
ages
it
arose
there
about
the
time
that
the
cid
came
into
vogue
in
spain
the
arthur
legends
were
being
put
into
shape
in
england
and
the
nibelungen
reaching
its
ultimate
form
in
germany
reynard
thus
fills
up
the
geographical
chart
of
contemporary
literary
effort
for
the
thirteenth
century
since
france
and
italy
come
in
for
their
share
in
other
forms
of
literature
and
no
country
is
missing
from
the
story
of
successful
enduring
accomplishment
in
letters
it
was
written
from
so
close
to
the
heart
of
nature
that
it
makes
a
most
interesting
gift
book
even
for
the
twentieth
century
child
and
yet
will
be
read
with
probably
even
more
pleasure
by
the
parents
with
good
reason
another
recent
editor
has
thus
summed
up
the
catholicity
of
its
appeal
to
all
generations
this
book
belongs
to
the
rare
class
which
is
equally
delightful
to
children
and
to
their
elders
in
this
regard
it
may
be
compared
to
travels
quixote
and
progress
for
wit
and
shrewd
satire
and
for
pure
drollery
both
in
situations
and
descriptions
it
is
unsurpassed
the
animals
are
not
men
dressed
up
in
the
skin
of
beasts
but
are
throughout
true
to
their
characters
and
are
not
only
strongly
realized
but
consistently
drawn
albeit
in
so
simple
and
captivating
a
way
that
the
subtle
art
of
the
narrator
is
quite
hidden
and
one
is
aware
only
of
reading
an
absorbingly
interesting
and
witty
tale
to
have
a
place
beside
gulliver
the
old
spanish
knight
and
christian
shows
the
estimation
in
which
the
book
is
held
by
those
who
are
best
acquainted
with
it
the
work
is
probably
best
known
through
the
version
of
it
which
has
come
to
us
from
the
greatest
of
german
poets
goethe
whose
reineke
fuchs
has
perhaps
had
more
sympathetic
readers
and
a
wider
audience
than
any
other
of
goethe
works
the
very
fact
that
so
deeply
intellectual
a
literary
man
should
have
considered
it
worth
his
while
to
devote
his
time
to
making
a
modern
version
of
it
shows
not
only
the
estimation
in
which
he
held
it
but
also
affords
excellent
testimony
to
its
worth
as
literature
for
goethe
unlike
most
poets
was
a
fine
literary
critic
and
one
who
above
all
knew
the
reasons
for
the
esthetic
faith
that
was
in
him
animal
stories
in
every
age
however
have
been
imitations
of
it
much
more
than
is
usually
imagined
while
the
author
probably
obtained
the
hint
for
his
work
from
some
of
the
fables
as
they
came
to
him
by
tradition
though
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
aesop
was
familiar
to
him
and
many
for
thinking
the
greek
fabulist
was
not
he
added
so
much
to
this
simple
literary
mode
transformed
it
so
thoroughly
from
literature
to
world
literature
that
the
main
merit
of
modern
animal
stories
must
be
attributed
to
him
uncle
remus
and
the
many
compilations
of
this
kind
that
have
been
popular
in
our
own
generation
owe
much
more
to
the
animal
epic
than
might
be
thought
possible
by
one
not
familiar
with

work
every
language
has
a
translation
of
the
animal
epic
and
most
of
the
generations
since
have
been
interested
and
amused
by
the
quaint
conceits
which
enable
the
author
to
picture
so
undisguisedly
men
and
women
under
animal
garb
it
discloses
better
than
any
other
specimen
of
the
literature
of
the
time
that
men
and
women
do
not
change
even
in
the
course
of
centuries
and
that
in
the
heart
of
the
middle
ages
a
wise
observer
could
see
the
foibles
of
humanity
just
as
they
exist
at
the
present
time
any
one
who
thinks
that
evolution
after
seven
centuries
should
have
changed
men
somewhat
in
their
ethical
aspects
at
least
made
their
aspirations
higher
and
their
tendencies
less
commonplace
not
to
say
less
degenerative
should
read
one
of
the
old
versions
of
reynard
the
fox
and
be
convinced
that
men
and
women
in
the
thirteenth
century
were
quite
the
same
as
we
are
familiar
with
them
at
the
present
moment
the
second
of
the
most
read
books
of
the
century
is
the
famous
legenda
aurea
or
as
it
has
been
called
in
english
the
golden
legend
written
by
jacobus
de
voragine
the
distinguished
dominican
preacher
and
writer
born
during
the
first
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
died
just
at
its
close
who
after
rising
to
the
higher
grades
in
his
own
order
became
the
archbishop
of
genoa
his
work
at
once
sprang
into
popular
favor
and
continued
to
be
perhaps
the
most
widely
read
book
with
the
exception
of
the
holy
scriptures
during
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
it
was
one
of
the
earliest
books
printed
in
italy
the
first
edition
appearing
about
and
it
is
evident
that
it
was
considered
that
its
widespread
popularity
would
not
only
reimburse
the
publisher
but
would
help
the
nascent
art
of
printing
by
bringing
it
to
the
attention
of
a
great
many
people
its
subject
is
very
different
from
that
of
the
modern
most
read
books
librarians
do
not
often
have
to
supply
lives
of
saints
nowadays
though
some
similarities
of
material
with
that
of
books
now
much
in
demand
help
to
account
for
its
vogue
jacobus
de
voragine
work
consisted
of
the
lives
of
the
greater
saints
of
the
church
since
the
time
of
christ
and
detailed
especially
the
wonderful
things
that
happened
in
their
lives
some
of
which
of
course
were
mythical
and
all
of
them
containing
marvelous
stories
this
gave
prominence
to
many
legends
that
have
continued
to
maintain
their
hold
upon
the
popular
imagination
ever
since
with
all
this
adventitious
interest
however
the
book
contained
a
solid
fund
of
information
with
regard
to
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
besides
it
taught
the
precious
lessons
of
unselfishness
and
the
care
for
others
of
the
men
who
had
come
to
be
greeted
by
the
title
of
saint
the
work
must
have
done
not
a
little
to
stir
up
the
faith
enliven
the
charity
and
build
up
the
characters
of
the
people
of
the
time
and
certainly
has
fewer
objections
than
most
popular
reading
at
any
period
of
the
world
history
for
young
folks
the
wonderful
legends
afforded
excellent
and
absolutely
innocuous
exercise
of
the
functions
of
the
imagination
quite
as
well
as
our
own
modern
wonder
books
or
fairy
tales
while
the
stories
themselves
presented
many
descriptive
portions
out
of
which
subjects
for
decorative
purposes
could
readily
be
obtained
it
must
be
set
down
as
another
typical
distinction
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
an
addition
to
its
greatness
that
it
should
have
made
the
golden
legend
popular
and
thus
preserved
it
for
future
generations
who
became
deeply
interested
in
it
as
in
most
of
the
other
precious
heritages

the
third
of

most
read
books
of
the

the
romance
of
the
rose
is
not
so
well
known
except
by
scholars
as
is
the
animal
epic
or
perhaps
even
the
golden
legend
anyone
who
wants
to
understand
the
burden
of
the
time
however
and
who
wishes
to
put
himself
in
the
mood
and
the
tense
to
comprehend
not
only
the
other
literature
of
the
era
and
in
this
must
be
included
even
dante
but
also
the
social
educational
and
even
scientific
movements
of
the
period
must
become
familiar
with
it
it
has
been
well
said
that
a
knowledge
and
study
of
the
three
most
read
books
of
the
century
those
which
we
have
named
will
afford
a
far
clearer
insight
into
the
daily
life
and
the
spirit
working
within
the
people
for
whom
they
were
written
than
the
annals
of
the
wars
or
political
struggles
that
were
waged
during
the
same
period
between
kings
and
nobles
for
this
clearer
insight
a
knowledge
of
the
romance
of
the
rose
is
more
important
than
of
the
others
it
provides
a
better
introduction
to
the
customs
and
habits
the
manners
of
thought
and
of
action
the
literary
and
educational
interests
of
the
people
of
the
thirteenth
century
than
any
mere
history
however
detailed
could
in
this
respect
it
resembles
homer
who
as
froude
declares
has
given
us
a
better
idea
of
greek
life
than
a
whole
encyclopedia
of
classified
information
would
have
done

stories
of
no
other
periods
in

are
so
well

nor
so
readily
to
be
comprehended
as
those
of
homer
and
the
authors
of
the
medieval
romaunt
the
romance
of
the
rose
continued
to
be
for
more
than
two
centuries
the
most
read
book
in
europe
every
one
with
any
pretense
to
scholarship
or
to
literary
taste
in
any
european
country
considered
it
necessary
to
be
familiar
with
it
and
without
exaggeration
what
lowell
once
declared
with
regard
to
don
quixote
that
it
would
be
considered
a
mark
of
lack
of
culture
to
miss
a
reference
to
it
in
any
country
in
europe
might
well
have
been
repeated
during
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
of
the
romance
of
the
rose
it
has
in
recent
years
been
put
into
very
suitable
english
dress
by
ellis
and
published
among
the
temple
classics
thus
placing
it
within
easy
reach
of
english
readers
ellis
must
certainly
be
considered
a
suitable
judge
of
the
interest
there
is
in
the
work
he
spent
several
years
in
translating
its
two
and
twenty
thousand
six
hundred
and
eight
lines
and
yet
considers
that
few
books
deserve
as
much
attention
as
this
typical
thirteenth
century
allegory
he
says
the
charge
of
dulness
once
made
against
this
highly
imaginative
and
brilliant
book
successive
english
writers
until
quite
recent
times
have
been
content
to
accept
the
verdict
though
professor
morley
and
others
have
of
late
ably
repelled
the
charge
if
further
testimony
were
necessary
as
to
the
falsity
of
the
accusation
and
the
opinion
of
one
who
has
found
a
grateful
pastime
in
translating
it
might
be
considered
of
any
weight
he
would
not
hesitate
to
traverse
the
attribution
of
dulness
and
to
assert
that
it
is
a
poem
of
extreme
interest
written
as
to
the
first
part
with
delicate
fancy
sweet
appreciation
of
natural
beauty
clear
insight
and
skilful
invention
while
de
meun
continuation
is
distinguished
by
vigor
brilliant
invention
and
close
observation
of
human
nature
the
thirteenth
century
lives
before
us
the
rose
is
written
on
a
lofty
plane
of
literary
value
and
the
fact
that
it
was
so
popular
speaks
well
for
the
taste
of
the
times
and
for
the
enthusiasm
of
the
people
for
the
more
serious
forms
of
literature
not
that
the
romance
of
the
rose
is
a
very
serious
book
itself
but
if
we
compare
it
with
the
popular
publications
which
barely
touch
the
realities
of
life
in
the
modern
time
it
will
seem
eminently
serious
in
spite
of
the
years
that
have
elapsed
since
its
original
publication
it
has
not
lost
all
its
interest
even
for
a
casual
reader
and
especially
for
one
whose
principal
study
is
mankind
in
its
varying
environment
down
the
ages
for
it
presents
a
very
interesting
picture
of
men
and
their
ways
in
this
wonderful
century
here
as
in
the
stories
of
reynard
the
fox
one
is
brought
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
men
and
women
have
not
changed
and
that
the
peccadillos
of
our
own
generation
have
their
history
in
the
middle
ages
also
take
for
instance
the
question
of
the
too
great
love
of
money
which
is
now
the
subject
of
so
much
writing
and
sermonizing
one
might
think
that
at
least
this
was
modern
here
however
is
what
the
author
of
the
romance
of
the
rose
has
to
say
about
it
three
cruel
vengeances
pursue
these
miserable
wretches
who
hoard
up
their
worthless
wealth
great
toil
is
theirs
to
win
it
then
their
spoil
they
fear
to
lose
and
lastly
grieve
most
bitterly
that
they
must
leave
their
hoards
behind
them
cursed
they
die
who
living
lived
but
wretchedly
for
no
man
if
he
lack
of
love
hath
peace
below
or
joy
above
if
those
who
heap
up
wealth
would
show
fair
love
to
others
they
would
go
through
life
beloved
and
thus
would
reign
sweet
happy
days
if
they
were
fain
who
hold
so
much
of
good
to
shower
around
their
bounty
unto
those
they
found
in
need
thereof
and
nobly
lent
their
money
free
from
measurement
of
usury
yet
gave
it
not
to
idle
gangrel
men
i
wot
that
then
throughout
the
land
were
seen
no
pauper
carl
or
starveling
quean
but
lust
of
wealth
doth
so
abase
man
heart
that
even
love
sweet
grace
bows
down
before
it
men
but
love
their
neighbors
that
their
love
may
prove
a
profit
and
both
bought
and
sold
are
friendships
at
the
price
of
gold
nay
shameless
women
set
to
hire
their
bodies
heedless
of
it
is
after
reading
a
passage
like
this
in
a
book
written
in
the
thirteenth
century
that
one
feels
the
full
truth
of
that
expression
of
the
greatest
of
american
critics
james
russell
lowell
which
so
often
comes
back
to
mind
with
regard
to
the
works
of
this
century
that
to
read
a
classic
is
like
reading
a
commentary
on
the
morning
paper
when
this
principle
is
applied
the
other
way
i
suppose
it
may
be
said
that
when
a
book
written
in
the
long
ago
sounds
as
if
it
were
the
utterance
of
some
one
aroused
by
the
evils
round
him
in
our
modern
life
then
it
springs
from
so
close
to
the
heart
of
nature
that
it
is
destined
to
live
and
have
an
influence
far
beyond
its
own
time
the
romance
of
the
rose
written
seven
centuries
ago
now
promises
to
have
renewed
youth
in
the
awakening
of
interest
in
our
gothic
ancestors
and
their
accomplishments
before
the
renaissance
came
to
trouble
the
stream
of
thought
and
writing
other
passages
serve
to
show
how
completely
the
poet
realized
all
the
abuses
of
the
desire
for
wealth
and
how
much
it
makes
men
waste
their
lives
over
unessentials
instead
of
trying
to
make
existence
worth
while
for
themselves
and
others
here
is
an
arraignment
of
the
strenuous
life
of
business
every
line
of
which
is
as
true
for
us
as
it
was
for
the
poet
generation
is
truth
though
some
little
please
to
hear
the
trader
knows
no
ease
for
ever

his
soul
a
prey
to
anxious
care

should

the

in

the

are
little

some
thirteenth
century
prose
it
would
be
unpardonable
to
allow
the
notion
to
be
entertained
that
it
was
only
in
poetry
that
the
writers
of
the
thirteenth
century
succeeded
in
creating
works
of
enduring
influence
some
of
the
prose
writings
of
the
time
are
deeply
interesting
for
many
reasons
modern
prose
was
in
its
formative
period
and
the
evolution
of
style
as
of
other
things
in
the
making
is
proverbially
worthy
of
more
serious
study
than
even
the
developed
result
the
prose
writings
of
the
thirteenth
century
were
mainly
done
in
latin
but
that
was
not
for
lack
of
command
over
the
vernacular
tongues
as
we
shall
see
but
because
this
was
practically
a
universal
language
this
century
had
among
other
advantages
that
subsequent
ages
have
striven
for
unsuccessfully
our
own
most
of
all
a
common
medium
of
expression
for
all
scholars
at
least
there
are
however
the
beginnings
of
prose
in
all
the
modern
languages
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
latin
of
the
time
had
a
great
influence
on
the
vernacular
and
that
the
modes
of
expression
which
had
become
familiar
in
the
learned
tongue
were
naturally
transferred
to
the
vulgar
speech
as
it
was
called
whenever
accuracy
of
thought
and
nicety
of
expression
invited
such
transmutation
with
regard
to
the
latin
of
the
period
it
is
the
custom
of
many
presumably
men
to
sniff
a
little
and
say
deprecatingly
that
after
all
much
can
not
be
expected
from
the
writers
of
the
time
since
they
were
dependent
on
medieval
or
scholastic
latin
for
the
expression
of
their
ideas
this
criticism
is
supposed
to
do
away
with
any
idea
of
the
possibility
of
there
having
been
a
praiseworthy
prose
style
at
this
time
in
the
middle
ages
in
the
chapter
on
the
latin
hymns
we
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
same
mode
of
criticism
was
supposed
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
rhymed
latin
as
worthy
to
occupy
a
prominent
place
in
literature
the
widespread
encouragement
of
this
false
impression
has
as
a
matter
of
fact
led
to
a
neglect
of
these
wonderful
poems
though
they
may
in
the
opinion
of
competent
critics
even
be
considered
as
representing
the
true
genius
of
the
latin
language
and
its
powers
of
poetic
expression
better
than
the
greek
poetic
modes
which
were
adopted
by
the
romans
but
which
with
the
possible
exception
of
their
two
greatest
poets
never
seem
to
have
acquired
that
spontaneity
that
would
characterize
a
native
outburst
of
lingual
vitality
as
for
the
philosophic
writers
of
the
century
that
great
period
holds
in
this
as
in
other
departments
the
position
of
the
palmiest
time
of
the
middle
ages
to
it
belongs

that
have
attracted
renewed
attention
in
our
day
died
in
with
regard
to
what
was
accomplished
in
philosophic
and
theologic
prose
examples
will
be
found
in
the
chapter
on
thomas
aquinas
which
prove
beyond
all
doubt
the
utter
simplicity
the
directness
and
the
power
of
the
prose
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
the
medical
works
of
the
time
there
was
less
directness
but
always
a
simplicity
that
made
them
commendable
in
general
university
writers
were
influenced
by
the
scholastic
methods
and
we
find
it
reflected
constantly
in
their
works
in
the
minds
of
many
people
this
would
be
enough
at
once
to
condemn
it
it
will
usually
be
found
however
as
we
have
noted
before
that
those
who
are
readiest
to
condemn
scholastic
writing
know
nothing
about
it
or
so
little
that
their
opinion
is
not
worth
considering
usually
they
have
whatever
knowledge
they
think
they
possess
at
second
hand
sometimes
all
that
they
have
read
of
scholastic
philosophy
are
some
particularly
obscure
passages
on
abstruse
subjects
selected
by
some
prejudiced
historian
in
order
to
show
how
impossible
was
the
philosophic
writing
of
these
centuries
of
the
later
middle
ages
there
are
other
opinions
however
that
are
of
quite
different
significance
and
value
we
shall
quote
but
one
of
them
written
by
professor
saintsbury
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
who
in
his
volume
on
the
flourishing
of
romance
and
the
rise
of
allegory
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
of
his
periods
of
european
literature
has
shown
how
sympathetically
the
prose
writing
of
the
thirteenth
century
may
appeal
even
to
a
scholarly
modern
whose
main
interests
have
been
all
his
life
in
literature
far
from
thinking
that
prose
was
spoiled
by
scholasticism
saintsbury
considers
that
scholasticism
was
the
fortunate
training
school
in
which
all
the
possibilities
of
modern
prose
were
brought
out
and
naturally
introduced
into
the
budding
languages
of
the
time
he
says
however
this
may
be
whether
the
science
of
the
nineteenth
century
after
an
equal
interval
will
be
of
any
more
positive
value
whether
it
will
not
have
even
less
comparative
interest
than
that
which
appertains
to
the
scholasticism
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
claim
modest
and
even
meager
as
it
may
seem
to
some
which
has
been
here
once
more
put
forward
for
this
scholasticism
the
claim
of
a
educative
influence
in
mere
language
in
mere
system
of
arrangement
and
expression
will
remain
valid
if
at
the
outset
of
the
career
of
modern
languages
men
had
thought
with
the
looseness
of
modern
thought
had
indulged
in
the
haphazard
slovenliness
of
modern
logic
had
popularized
theology
and
vulgarized
rhetoric
as
we
have
seen
both
popularized
and
vulgarized
since
we
should
indeed
have
been
in
evil
case
it
used
to
be
thought
clever
to
moralize
and
to
felicitate
mankind
over
the
rejection
of
the
stays
the
fetters
the
prison
in
which
its
thought
was
medievally
kept
the
justice
or
the
injustice
the
taste
or
the
vulgarity
of
these
moralizings
of
these
felicitations
may
not
concern
us
here
but
in
expression
as
distinguished
from
thought
the
value
of
the
discipline
to
which
these
youthful
languages
was
subjected
is
not
likely
now
to
be
denied
by
any
scholar
who
has
paid
attention
to
the
subject
it
would
have
been
perhaps
a
pity
if
thought
had
not
gone
through
other
phases
it
would
certainly
have
been
a
pity
if
the
tongues
had
been
subjected
to
the
fullest
influence
of
latin
constraint
but
that
the
more
lawless
of
them
benefited
by
that
constraint
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
the
influence
of
form
which
the
best
latin
hymns
of
the
middle
ages
exercised
in
poetry
the
influence
in
vocabulary
and
in
logical
arrangement
which
scholasticism
exercised
in
prose
are
beyond
dispute
and
even
those
who
will
not
pardon
literature
whatever
its
historic
and
educative
importance
be
for
being
something
less
than
masterly
in
itself
will
find
it
difficult
to
maintain
the
exclusion
of
the
cur
deus
homo
and
impossible
to
refuse
admission
to
the
dies
irae
besides
this
philosophic
and
scientific
prose
there
were
two
forms
of
writing
of
which
this
century
presents
a
copious
number
of
examples
these
are
the
chronicles
and
biographies
of
the
time
and
the
stories
of
travelers
and
explorers
these
latter
we
have
treated
in
a
separate
chapter
the
chronicles
of
the
time
deserve
to
be
studied
with
patient
attention
by
anyone
who
wishes
to
know
the
prose
writers
of
the
century
and
the
character
of
the
men
of
that
time
and
their
outlook
on
life
it
is
usually
considered
that
chroniclers
are
rather
tiresome
old
fogies
who
talk
much
and
say
very
little
who
accept
all
sorts
of
legends
on
insufficient
authority
and
who
like
to
fill
up
their
pages
with
wonderful
things
regardless
of
their
truth
in
this
regard
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
in
times
almost
within
the
memory
of
men
still
alive
herodotus
now
looked
upon
deservedly
as
the
father
of
history
and
one
of
the
great
historical
writers
of
all
time
was
considered
to
have
a
place
among
these
chroniclers
and
his
works
were
ranked
scarcely
higher
except
for
the
purity
of
their
greek
style
the
first
of
the
great
chroniclers
in
a
modern
tongue
was
the
famous
geoffrey
de
villehardouin
who
was
not
only
a
writer
of
but
an
actor
in
the
scenes
which
he
describes
he
was
enrolled
among
the
elite
of
french
chivalry
in
that
crusade
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
which
resulted
in
the
foundation
of
the
empire
his
book
entitled
the
conquest
of
constantinople
includes
the
story
of
the
expedition
during
the
years
from
to
modern
war
correspondents
have
seldom
succeeded
in
giving
a
more
vivid
picture
of
the
events
of
which
they
were
witnesses
than
this
first
french
chronicler
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
is
evident
that
the
work
was
composed
with
the
idea
that
it
should
be
recited
as
had
been
the
old
poetic
chansons
de
geste
in
the
castles
of
the
nobles
and
before
assemblages
of
the
people
perhaps
on
fair
days
and
other
times
when
they
were
gathered
together
the
consequence
is
that
it
is
written
in
a
lively
straightforward
style
with
direct
appeals
to
its
auditors
it
contains
not
a
few
passages
of
highly
poetic
description
which
show
that
the
chronicler
was
himself
a
literary
man
of
no
mean
order
and
probably
well
versed
in
the
effusions
of
the
old
poets
of
this
country
his
description
of
the
fleet
of
the
crusaders
as
it
was
about
to
set
sail
for
the
east
and
then
his
description
of
its
arrival
before
the
imposing
walls
of
the
imperial
city
are
the
best
examples
of
this
and
have
not
been
surpassed
even
by
modern
writers
on
similar
topics
though
the
french
writer
was
beyond
all
doubt
not
familiar
with
the
grecian
writers
and
knew
nothing
of
xenophon
there
is
a
constant
reminder
of
the
greek
historian
in
his
work
xenophon
simple
directness
his
sincerity
the
impression
he
produces
of
absolute
good
faith
and
confidence
in
the
completeness
of
the
picture
so
that
one
feels
that
one
has
been
present
almost
at
many
of
the
scenes
described
are
all
to
be
encountered
in
his
medieval
successor
villehardouin
went
far
ahead
of
his
predecessors
the
chroniclers
of
foregoing
centuries
in
his
careful
devotion
to
truth
a
french
writer
has
declared
that
to
villehardouin
must
be
ascribed
the
foundation
of
historical
probity
none
of
his
facts
stated
as
such
has
ever
been
impugned
and
though
his
long
speeches
must
necessarily
have
been
his
own
composition
there
seems
no
doubt
that
they
contain
the
ideas
which
had
been
expressed
on
various
occasions
and
besides
were
composed
with
due
reference
to
the
character
of
the
speaker
and
convey
something
of
his
special
style
of
expression
saintsbury
in
his
article
in
the
encyclopedia
britannica
on
villehardouin
sums
up
very
strikingly
the
place
that
this
first
great
vernacular
historian
book
must
occupy
he
says
it
is
not
impertinent
and
at
the
same
time
an
excuse
for
what
has
been
already
said
to
repeat
that
villehardouin
book
brief
as
it
is
is
in
reality
one
of
the
capital
books
of
literature
not
merely
for
its
merit
but
because
it
is
the
most
authentic
and
the
most
striking
embodiment
in
the
contemporary
literature
of
the
sentiments
which
determined
the
action
of
a
great
and
important
period
of
history
there
are
but
very
few
books
which
hold
this
position
and
villehardouin
is
one
of
them
if
every
other
contemporary
record
of
the
crusades
perished
we
should
still
be
able
by
aid
of
this
to
understand
and
realize
what
the
mental
attitude
of
crusaders
of
teutonic
knights
and
the
rest
was
and
without
this
we
should
lack
the
earliest
the
most
undoubtedly
genuine
and
the
most
characteristic
of
all
such
records
the
very
inconsistency
with
which
villehardouin
is
chargeable
the
absence
of
compunction
with
which
he
relates
the
changing
of
a
sacred
religious
pilgrimage
into
something
by
no
means
unlike
a
mere
filibustering
raid
on
a
great
scale
add
a
charm
to
the
book
for
religious
as
it
is
it
is
entirely
free
from
the
very
slightest
touch
of
hypocrisy
or
indeed
of
of
any
kind
the
famous
description
of
the
crusades
dei
per
was
evidently
to
villehardouin
a
plain
description
and
it
no
more
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
the
divine
favor
being
extended
to
the
expeditions
against
alexius
or
theodore
than
to
doubt
that
it
was
shown
to
expeditions
against
saracens
and
turks

it
was
especially
in
the
exploitation
of
biographical
material
that
the
thirteenth
century
chroniclers
were
at
their
best
any
one
who
recalls
carlyle
unstinted
admiration
of
jocelyn
of
brakelonds
life
of
abbot
sampson
in
his
essays
past
and
present
will
be
sure
that
at
least
one
writer
in
england
had
succeeded
in
pleasing
so
difficult
a
critic
in
this
rather
thorny
mode
of
literary
expression
it
is
easy
to
say
too
much
or
too
little
about
the
virtues
and
the
vices
of
a
man
whose
biography
one
has
chosen
to
write
jocelyn
simple
straightforward
story
would
seem
to
fulfill
the
best
canons
of
modern
criticism
in
this
respect
probably
no
more
vivid
picture
of
a
man
and
his
ways
was
ever
given
until
boswell
johnson
nor
was
the
english
chronicler
alone
in
this
respect
the
sieur
de
biographical
studies
of
the
life
of
louis
ix
furnish
another
example
of
this
literary
mode
at
its
best
and
modern
writers
of
biography
could
not
do
better
than
go
back
to
read
these
intimate
pictures
of
the
life
of
a
great
king
which
are
not
flattered
nor
overdrawn
but
give
us
the
man
as
he
actually
was
the
english
biographic
chronicler
of
the
olden
time
could
picture
exciting
scenes
without
any
waste
of
words
a
specimen
of
his
work
will
serve
to
show
the
merit
of
his
style
after
reading
it
one
is
not
likely
to
be
surprised
that
carlyle
should
have
so
taken
the
chronicler
to
heart
nor
been
so
enthusiastic
in
his
praise
it
is
the
very
type
of
that
impressionism
in
style
that
has
once
more
in
the
course
of
time
become
the
fad
of
our
own
day
the
abbot
was
informed
that
the
church
of
woolpit
was
vacant
walter
of
coutances
being
chosen
to
the
bishopric
of
lincoln
he
presently
convened
the
prior
and
great
part
of
the
convent
and
taking
up
his
story
thus
began
well
know
what
trouble
i
had
in
respect
of
the
church
of
woolpit
and
in
order
that
it
should
be
obtained
for
your
exclusive
use
i
journeyed
to
rome
at
your
instance
in
the
time
of
the
schism
between
pope
alexander
and
octavian
i
passed
through
italy
at
that
time
when
all
clerks
bearing
letters
of
our
lord
the
pope
alexander
were
taken
some
were
imprisoned
some
hanged
and
some
with
nose
and
lips
cut
off
sent
forward
to
the
pope
to
his
shame
and
confusion
i
however
pretended
to
be
scotch
and
putting
on
the
garb
of
a
scotchman
and
the
gesture
of
one
i
often
brandished
my
staff
in
the
way
they
use
that
weapon
called
a
gaveloc
at
those
who
mocked
me
using
threatening
language
after
the
manner
of
the
scotch
to
those
that
met
and
questioned
me
as
to
who
i
was
i
answered
nothing
but
ride
ride
rome
turne
cantwereberei
this
did
i
to
conceal
myself
and
my
errand
and
that
i
should
get
to
rome
safer
in
the
guise
of
a
scotchman
obtained
letters
from
the
pope
even
as
i
wished
on
my
return
i
passed
by
a
certain
castle
as
my
way
led
me
from
the
city
and
behold
the
officers
thereof
came
about
me
laying
hold
upon
me
and
saying
this
vagabond
who
makes
himself
out
to
be
a
scotchman
is
either
a
spy
or
bears
letters
from
the
false
pope
alexander
and
while
they
examined
my
ragged
clothes
and
my
boots
and
my
breeches
and
even
the
old
shoes
which
i
carried
over
my
shoulders
after
the
fashion
of
the
scotch
i
thrust
my
hand
into
the
little
wallet
which
i
carried
wherein
was
contained
the
letter
of
our
lord
the
pope
placed
under
a
little
cup
i
had
for
drinking
the
lord
god
and
edmund
so
permitting
i
drew
out
both
the
letter
and
the
cup
together
so
that
extending
my
arm
aloft
i
held
the
letter
underneath
the
cup
they
could
see
the
cup
plain
enough
but
they
did
not
see
the
letter
and
so
i
got
clear
out
of
their
hands
in
the
name
of
the
lord
whatever
money
i
had
about
me
they
took
away
therefore
i
had
to
beg
from
door
to
door
without
any
payment
until
i
arrived
in
england

excellent
example
of
the
biographic
prose
of
the
century

this
is

of
louis
without
doubt
one
of
the
precious
biographical
treasures
of

contains
a
vivid
portrait
of

made
by
a

who
knew
him
well

took
part

in
some
of
the
important

those
who
think
that

such

recalls

was
reserved
for
the
modern
war
correspondent
should
read
certain
portions
of
joinville
book
as
an
example
we
have
ventured
to
quote
the
page
on
which
the
seneschal
historian
himself
recounts
the
role
which
he
played
in
the
famous
battle
of
mansourah
at
which
with
the
count
de
soissons
and
pierre
de
neuville
he
defended
a
small
bridge
against
the
enemy
under
a
hail
of
arrows
he
says
before
us
there
were
two
sergeants
of
the
king
one
of
whom
was
named
william
de
boon
and
the
other
john
of
gamaches
against
these
the
turks
who
had
placed
themselves
between
the
river
and
the
little
tributary
led
a
whole
mob
of
villains
on
foot
who
hurled
at
them
clods
of
turf
or
whatever
came
to
hand
never
could
they
make
them
recoil
upon
us
however
as
a
last
resort
the
turks
sent
forward
a
foot
soldier
who
three
times
launched
greek
fire
at
them
once
william
de
boon
received
the
pot
of
green
fire
upon
his
buckler
if
the
fire
had
touched
anything
on
him
he
would
have
been
entirely
burned
up
we
at
the
rear
were
all
covered
by
arrows
which
had
missed
the
sergeants
it
happened
that
i
found
a
waistcoat
which
had
been
stuffed
by
one
of
the
saracens
i
turned
the
open
side
of
it
towards
me
and
made
a
shield
out
of
the
vest
which
rendered
me
great
service
for
i
was
wounded
by
their
arrows
in
only
five
places
though
my
horse
was
wounded
in
fifteen
one
of
my
own
men
brought
me
a
banner
with
my
arms
and
a
lance
every
time
then
that
we
saw
that
they
were
pressing
the
royal
sergeants
we
charged
upon
them
and
they
fled
the
good
count
soissons
from
the
point
at
which
we
were
joked
with
me
and
said
let
us
hoot
out
this
rabble
for
by
the
headdress
of
god
this
was
his
favorite
oath
we
shall
talk
over
this
day
you
and
i
many
a
time
in
our
ladies
halls
we
have
said
that
the
writing
of
the
thirteenth
century
must
have
been
done
to
a
great
extent
for
the
sake
of
the
women
of
the
time
and
that
its
very
existence
was
a
proof
that
the
women
possessed
a
degree
of
culture
that
might
not
be
realized
from
the
few
details
that
have
been
preserved
to
us
of
their
education
and
habits
of
life
in
this
last
passage
of
joinville
we
have
the
proof
of
this
since
evidently
the
telling
of
the
stories
of
these
days
of
battle
was
done
mainly
in
order
that
the
women
folks
might
have
their
share
in
the
excitement
of
the
campaign
and
might
be
enabled
vividly
to
appreciate
what
the
dangers
had
been
and
how
gloriously
their
lords
had
triumphed
at
every
period
of
the
world
history
it
was
true
that
literature
was
mainly
made
for
women
and
that
some
of
the
best
portions
of
it
always
concerned
them
very
closely
we
have
purposely
left
till
last
the
greatest
of
the
chroniclers
of
the
thirteenth
century
matthew
paris
the
author
of
the
historia
major
who
owes
his
surname
doubtless
to
the
fact
that
he
was
educated
at
the
university
of
paris
instead
of
trying
to
tell
anything
about
him
from
our
own
slight
personal
knowledge
we
prefer
to
quote
the
passage
from
green
history
of
the
english
people
in
which
one
of
the
greatest
of
our
modern
english
historians
pays
such
a
magnificent
tribute
to
his
colleague
of
the
earlier
times
the
story
of
this
period
of
misrule
has
been
preserved
for
us
by
an
annalist
whose
pages
glow
with
the
new
outburst
of
patriotic
feeling
which
this
common
expression
of
the
people
and
the
clergy
had
produced
matthew
paris
is
the
greatest
as
he
is
in
reality
the
last
of
our
monastic
historians
the
school
of
albans
survived
indeed
till
a
far
later
time
but
the
writers
dwindle
into
mere
annalists
whose
view
is
bounded
by
the
abbey
precincts
and
whose
work
is
as
colorless
as
it
is
jejune
in
matthew
the
breadth
and
precision
of
the
narrative
the
copiousness
of
his
information
on
topics
whether
national
or
european
the
general
fairness
and
justice
of
his
comments
are
only
surpassed
by
the
patriotic
fire
and
enthusiasm
of
the
whole
he
had
succeeded
roger
of
wendover
as
chronicler
of
albans
and
the
greater
chronicle
with
the
abridgement
of
it
which
has
long
passed
under
the
name
of
matthew
of
westminster
a
history
of
the
english
and
the
lives
of
the
earlier
abbots
were
only
a
few
among
the
voluminous
works
which
attest
his
prodigious
industry
he
was
an
eminent
artist
as
well
as
a
historian
and
many
of
the
manuscripts
which
are
preserved
are
illustrated
by
his
own
hand
a
large
circle
of
correspondents
bishops
like
grosseteste
ministers
like
hubert
de
burgh
officials
like
alexander
de
swinford
furnished
him
with
minute
accounts
of
political
and
ecclesiastical
proceedings
pilgrims
from
the
east
and
papal
agents
brought
news
of
foreign
events
to
his
scriptorium
at
albans
he
had
access
to
and
quotes
largely
from
state
documents
charters
and
exchequer
rolls
the
frequency
of
the
royal
visits
to
the
abbey
brought
him
a
store
of
political
intelligence
and
henry
himself
contributed
to
the
great
chronicle
which
has
preserved
with
so
terrible
a
faithfulness
the
memory
of
his
weakness
and
misgovernment
on
one
solemn
the
king
recognized
matthew
and
bidding
him
sit
on
the
middle
step
between
the
floor
and
the
throne
begged
him
to
write
the
story
of
the
day
proceedings
while
on
a
visit
to
albans
he
invited
him
to
his
table
and
chamber
and
enumerated
by
name
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
english
barons
for
his
information
but
all
this
royal
patronage
has
left
little
mark
on
his
work
case
as
he
says
historical
writers
is
hard
for
if
they
tell
the
truth
they
provoke
men
and
if
they
write
what
is
false
they
offend
with
all
the
fullness
of
the
school
of
court
historians
such
as
benedict
or
hoveden
matthew
paris
combines
an
independence
and
patriotism
which
is
strange
to
their
pages
he
denounces
with
the
same
unsparing
energy
the
oppression
of
the
papacy
and
the
king
his
point
of
view
is
neither
that
of
a
courtier
nor
of
a
churchman
but
of
an
englishman
and
the
new
national
tone
of
his
chronicle
is
but
an
echo
of
the
national
sentiment
which
at
last
bound
nobles
and
yeomen
and
churchmen
together
into
an
english
people
we
of
the
twentieth
century
are
a
people
of
information
and
encyclopedias
rather
than
of
literature
so
that
we
shall
surely
appreciate
one
important
specimen
of
the
prose
writing
of
the
thirteenth
century
since
it
comprises
the
first
modern
encyclopedia
its
author
was
the
famous
vincent
of
beauvais
vincent
consulted
all
the
authors
sacred
and
profane
that
he
could
possibly
lay
hands
on
and
the
number
of
them
was
indeed
prodigious
it
has
often
been
said
by
men
supposed
to
be
authorities
in
history
that
the
historians
of
the
middle
ages
had
at
their
disposition
only
a
small
number
of
books
and
that
above
all
they
were
not
familiar
with
the
older
historians
while
this
was
true
as
regards
the
greek
it
was
not
for
the
latin
historical
writers
vincent
of
beauvais
has
quotations
from
de
bello
gallico
from
sallust
catiline
and
jugurtha
from
quintus
curtius
from
suetonius
and
from
valerius
maximus
and
finally
from
justin
abridgement
of
trogus
pompeius
vincent
had
the
advantage
of
having
at
his
disposition
the
numerous
libraries
of
the
monasteries
throughout
france
the
extent
of
which
usually
unrealized
in
modern
times
will
be
appreciated
from
our
special
chapter
on
the
subject
besides
he
consulted
the
documents
in
the
chapter
houses
of
the
cathedrals
especially
those
of
paris
of
rouen
of
laon
of
beauvais
and
of
bayeux
which
were
particularly
rich
in
collections
of
documents
it
might
be
thought
that
these
libraries
and
archives
would
be
closely
guarded
far
from
being
closed
to
writers
from
the
outer
world
they
were
accessible
to
all
to
such
an
extent
indeed
that
a
number
of
them
are
mentioned
by
vincent
as
public
institutions
his
method
of
collecting
his
information
is
interesting
because
it
shows
the
system
employed
by
him
is
practically
that
which
has
obtained
down
to
our
own
day
he
made
use
for
his
immense
investigation
of
a
whole
army
of
young
assistants
most
of
whom
were
furnished
him
by
his
own
order
the
dominicans
he
makes
special
mention
in
a
number
of
places
of
quotations
due
to
their
collaboration
the
costliness
of
maintaining
such
a
system
would
have
made
the
completion
of
the
work
absolutely
impossible
were
it
not
for
the
liberality
of
king
louis
who
generously
offered
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
composition
vincent
has
acknowledged
this
by
declaring
in
his
prefatorial
letter
to
the
king
that
you
have
always
liberally
given
assistance
even
to
the
work
of
gathering
the
materials

vincent
method
of
writing
is
quite
as
interesting
as
his
method
of
compilation
of
facts
the
great
dominican
was
not
satisfied
with
being
merely
a
source
of
information
the
philosophy
of
history
has
received
its
greatest
christian
contribution
from
augustine
city
of
god
in
this
an
attempt
was
made
to
trace
the
meaning
and
causal
sequence
of
events
as
well
as
their
mere
external
connection
and
place
in
time
in
a
lesser
medieval
way
vincent
tried
deliberately
to
imitate
this
and
besides
writing
history
attempted
to
trace
the
philosophy
of
it
for
him
as
for
the
great
french
philosophic
historian
bossuet
in
his
universal
history
five
centuries
later
everything
runs
its
provided
race
from
the
creation
to
the
redemption
and
then
on
toward
the
consummation
of
the
world
he
describes
at
first
the
commencements
of
the
church
from
the
time
of
abel
through
its
progress
under
the
patriarchs
the
prophets
judges
kings
and
leaders
of
the
people
down
to
the
birth
of
christ
he
traces
the
history
of
the
apostles
and
of
the
first
disciples
though
he
makes
it
a
point
to
find
place
for
the
famous
deeds
of
the
great
men
of
pagan
antiquity
he
notes
the
commencement
of
empires
and
kingdoms
their
glory
their
decadence
their
ruin
and
the
sovereigns
who
made
them
illustrious
in
peace
and
war
there
was
much
that
was
defective
in
the
details
of
history
as
they
were
traced
by
vincent
much
that
was
lacking
in
completeness
but
the
intention
was
evidently
the
best
and
patience
and
labor
were
devoted
to
the
sources
of
history
at
his
command
perhaps
never
more
than
at
the
present
moment
have
we
been
in
a
position
to
realize
that
history
at
its
best
can
be
so
full
of
defects
even
after
further
centuries
of
consultation
of
documents
and
printed
materials
that
we
are
not
likely
to
be
in
the
mood
to
blame
this
first
modern
historian
very
much
as
for
the
other
portions
of
his
encyclopedia
biographic
literary
and
scientific
they
were
not
only
freely
consulted
by
his
contemporaries
and
successors
but
we
find
traces
of
their
influence
in
the
writings
and
also
in
the
decorative
work
of
the
next
two
centuries
we
have
already
spoken
of
the
use
of
his
book
in
the
provision
of
subjects
for
the
ornamentation
of
cathedrals
and
the
same
thing
might
be
said
of
edifices
of
other
kinds
nor
must
it
be
thought
that
vincent
has
only
a
historic
or
ecclesiastical
interest
julius
pagel
in
his
chapter
on
medicine
in
the
middle
ages
in
puschmann
of
the
history
of
medicine
footnote
says
that
there
were
three
writers
whose
works
were
even
more
popular
than
those
of
albertus
magnus
these
three
were
bartholomew
the
englishman
thomas
of
cantimprato
and
vincent
of
beauvais
the
last
of
whom
must
be
considered
as
one
of
the
most
important
contributors
to
the
generalization
of
scientific
knowledge
not
alone
in
the
thirteenth
but
in
the
immediately
succeeding
centuries
his
most
important
work
was
really
an
encyclopedia
of
the
knowledge
of
his
time
it
was
called
the
greater
triple
mirror
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
reflected
the
knowledge
of
his
period
he
had
the
true
scientific
spirit
and
constantly
cites
the
authorities
from
whom
his
information
was
derived
he
cites
hundreds
of
authors
and
there
is
scarcely
a
subject
that
he
does
not
touch
on

book

work

it
might
be
considered
that
such
a
compend
of
information
would
be
very
reading
and
that
it
would
be
fragmentary
in
character
and
little
likely
to
be
attractive
except
to
a
serious
student
pagel
opinion
does
not
agree
with
this
impression
he
says
with
regard
to
it
the
language
is
clear
readily
intelligible
and
the
information
is
conveyed
usually
in
an
excellent
simple
style
through
the
introduction
of
interesting
similes
the
contents
do
not
lack
a
certain
taking
quality
so
that
the
reading
of
the
work
easily
becomes
absorbing
this
is
i
suppose
almost
the
last
thing
that
might
be
expected
of
a
scientific
teacher
in
the
thirteenth
century
because
after
all
vincent
of
beauvais
must
be
considered
as
one
of
the
schoolmen
and
they
are
supposed
to
be
eminently
arid
but
evidently
if
we
are
to
trust
this
testimony
of
a
modern
german
physician
only
by
those
who
have
not
taken
the
trouble
to
read
them
one
of
the
most
important
works
of
thirteenth
century
prose
is
the
rationale
divinorum
officiorum
significance
of
the
divine
offices
written
by
william
durandus
the
bishop
of
mende
in
france
whose
tomb
and
its
inscription
in
the
handsome
old
gothic
cathedral
of
santa
maria
sopra
minerva
in
rome
shares
with
the
body
of
catherine
of
sienna
the
honor
of
attracting
so
many
visitors
the
book
has
been
translated
into
english
under
the
title
the
symbolism
of
churches
and
church
ornaments
and
has
been
very
widely
read
it
was
very
popular
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
the
best
possible
idea
of
its
subsequent
reputation
can
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
the
rationale
was
the
first
work
from
the
pen
of
an
uninspired
writer
to
be
accorded
the
privilege
of
being
printed
the
editio
princeps
a
real
first
edition
of
supreme
value
appeared
from
the
press
of
john
fust
in
the
only
other
books
that
had
been
printed
at
that
time
were
the
psalters
of
and
this
edition
is
of
course
of
the
most
extreme
rarity
according
to
the
english
translators
of
durandus
the
beauty
of
the
typography
has
seldom
been
exceeded
the
style
of
durandus
has
been
praised
very
much
by
the
critics
of
succeeding
centuries
for
its
straightforwardness
simplicity
and
brevity
most
of
these
qualities
it
evidently
owes
to
the
hours
spent
by
its
author
in
the
reading
of
holy
scriptures
durandus
fashioned
his
style
so
much
on
the
sacred
writings
that
most
of
his
book
possesses
something
of
the
impressive
character
of
the
bible
itself
the
impression
derived
from
it
is
that
of
reading
a
book
on
a
religious
subject
written
in
an
eminently
suitable
tone
and
spirit
most
of
this
impression
must
be
attributed
without
doubt
to
the
fact
that
durandus
has
not
only
formed
his
style
on
the
scriptures
but
has
actually
incorporated
scriptural
expressions
in
his
writings
to
such
an
extent
as
to
make
them
mostly
a
scriptural
composition
this
far
from
being
a
fault
appears
quite
appropriate
in
his
book
because
of
its
subject
and
the
method
of
treatment
a
quotation
from
the
proeme
as
it
is
in
the
quaint
spelling
of
the
english
translation
will
give
the
best
idea
of
this
all
things
as
pertain
to
offices
and
matters
ecclesiastical
be
full
of
divine
significations
and
mysterious
and
overflow
with
celestial
sweetness
if
so
be
that
a
man
be
diligent
in
his
study
of
them
and
know
how
to
draw
honey
from
the
rock
and
oil
from
the
hardest
stone
but
who
knoweth
the
ordinances
of
heaven
or
can
fix
the
reasons
thereof
upon
the
earth
for
he
that
prieth
into
their
majesty
is
overwhelmed
by
the
glory
of
them
of
a
truth
the
well
is
deep
and
i
have
nothing
to
draw
with
unless
he
giveth
it
unto
me
who
giveth
to
all
men
liberally
and
upbraideth
not
so
that
while
i
journey
through
the
mountains
i
may
draw
water
with
joy
out
of
the
wells
of
salvation
wherefore
albeit
of
the
things
handed
down
from
our
forefathers
capable
we
are
not
to
explain
all
yet
if
among
them
there
be
any
thing
which
is
done
without
reason
it
should
be
forthwith
put
away
wherefore
i
william
by
the
alone
tender
mercy
of
god
bishop
of
the
holy
church
which
is
in
mende
will
knock
diligently
at
the
door
if
so
be
that
the
key
of
david
will
open
unto
me
that
the
king
may
bring
me
into
his
treasure
and
shew
unto
me
the
heavenly
pattern
which
was
shewed
unto
moses
in
the
mount
so
that
i
may
learn
those
things
which
pertain
to
rites
ecclesiastical
whereof
they
teach
and
what
they
signify
and
that
i
may
be
able
plainly
to
reveal
and
make
manifest
the
reasons
of
them
by
his
help
who
hath
ordained
strength
out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
and
sucklings
whose
spirits
bloweth
where
it
listeth
dividing
to
each
severally
as
it
will
to
the
praise
and
glory
of
the
trinity
this
passage
alone
of
durandus
would
serve
as
an
excellent
refutation
of
the
protestant
tradition
fortunately
now
dying
out
though
not
as
yet
entirely
eradicated
which
stated
so
emphatically
that
the
bible
was
not
allowed
to
be
read
before
luther
time
those
who
wish
to
obtain
a
good
idea
of
durandus
style
and
the
way
he
presents
his
material
can
obtain
it
very
well
from
his
chapter
on
bells
the
first
two
paragraphs
of
which
we
venture
to
quote
they
will
be
found
quite
as
full
of
interesting
information
in
their
way
as
any
modern
writer
might
have
brought
together
and
have
the
dignity
and
simplicity
of
the
best
modern
prose
bells
are
brazen
vessels
and
were
first
invented
in
nola
a
city
of
campania
wherefore
the
larger
bells
are
called
campanae
from
campania
the
district
and
the
smaller
nolae
from
nola
the
town
you
must
know
that
bells
by
the
sound
of
which
the
people
assembleth
together
to
the
church
to
hear
and
the
clergy
to
preach
in
the
morning
the
mercy
of
god
and
his
power
by
night
do
signify
the
silver
trumpets
by
which
under
the
old
law
the
people
was
called
together
unto
sacrifice
of
these
trumpets
we
shall
speak
in
our
sixth
book
for
just
as
the
watchmen
in
a
camp
rouse
one
another
by
trumpets
so
do
the
ministers
of
the
church
excite
each
other
by
the
sound
of
bells
to
watch
the
livelong
night
against
the
plots
of
the
devil
wherefore
our
brazen
bells
are
more
sonorous
than
the
trumpets
of
the
old
law
because
then
god
was
known
in
judea
only
but
now
in
the
whole
earth
they
be
also
more
durable
for
they
signify
that
the
teaching
of
the
new
testament
will
be
more
lasting
than
the
trumpets
and
sacrifices
of
the
old
law
namely
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
again
bells
do
signify
preachers
who
ought
after
the
likeness
of
a
bell
to
exhort
the
faithful
unto
faith
the
which
was
typified
in
that
the
lord
commanded
moses
to
make
a
vestment
for
the
high
priest
who
entered
into
the
holy
of
holies
also
the
cavity
of
the
bell
denoteth
the
mouth
of
the
preacher
according
to
the
saying
of
the
apostle
i
am
become
as
sounding
brass
on
a
tinkling
cymbal
of
course
there
are
what
we
would
be
apt
to
consider
exaggerations
of
symbolic
meanings
and
explanations
and
references
but
this
was
of
the
taste
of
the
time
and
has
not
in
subsequent
centuries
been
so
beyond
the
canons
of
good
taste
as
at
present
durandus
goes
on
to
tell
that
the
hardness
of
the
metal
of
the
bell
signifies
fortitude
in
the
mind
of
the
preacher
that
the
wood
of
the
frame
on
which
the
bell
hangeth
doth
signify
the
wood
of
our
lord
cross
that
the
rope
by
which
the
bell
is
strung
is
humility
and
also
showeth
the
measure
of
life
that
the
ring
in
the
length
of
the
rope
is
the
crown
of
reward
for
perseverance
unto
the
end
and
then
proceeds
to
show
why
and
how
often
the
bells
are
rung
and
what
the
significance
of
each
ringing
is
he
explains
why
the
bells
are
silent
for
three
days
before
easter
and
also
during
times
of
interdict
and
gives
as
the
justification
for
this
last
the
quotation
from
the
prophet
i
will
make
thy
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
thy
mouth
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
even
these
few
specimens
of
the
prose
of
the
thirteenth
century
will
serve
to
show
that
the
writers
of
the
period
could
express
themselves
with
a
vigor
and
directness
which
have
made
their
books
interesting
reading
for
generations
long
after
their
time
and
which
stamp
their
authors
as
worthy
of
a

origin

the

in
the
world
perhaps
that
one
would
look
for
a
great
impulse
to
the
development
of
the
modern
drama
which
is
entirely
a
new
invention
an
outgrowth
of
christian
culture
and
has
practically
no
connection
with
the
classic
drama
would
be
in
the
life
of
francis
of
assisi
his
utter
simplicity
his
and
cordial
poverty
his
sincere
endeavor
all
during
his
life
to
make
little
of
himself
might
seem
quite
enough
to
forbid
any
thought
of
him
as
the
father
of
a
literary
movement
of
this
kind
the
poor
little
man
of
god
however
as
he
liked
to
call
himself
in
his
supreme
effort
to
get
back
to
nature
and
out
of
the
ways
of
the
conventional
world
succeeded
in
accomplishing
a
number
of
utterly
unexpected
results
his
love
for
nature
led
to
his
wonderful
expression
of
his
feelings
in
his
favorite
hymn
one
of
the
first
great
lyrical
outbursts
in
modern
poetry
a
religious
poem
which
as
we
shall
see
in
the
chapter
on
the
father
of
the
renaissance
renan
declares
can
only
be
appreciated
properly
by
comparing
it
with
the
old
hebrew
psalms
beside
which
it
is
worthy
to
be
placed
those
who
know
the
life
of
francis
best
will
easily
appreciate
how
dramatic
though
unconsciously
so
were
all
the
actions
of
his
life
after
all
his
utter
renunciation
of
all
things
his
taking
of
holy
poverty
to
be
his
bride
his
address
to
the
birds
his
sisters
his
famous
question
of
the
butcher
as
to
why
he
killed
his
brothers
the
sheep
his
personification
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
even
of
the
death
of
the
body
as
his
brothers
and
sisters
are
all
eminently
dramatic
moments
his
life
is
full
of
incidents
that
lent
themselves
because
of
their
dramatic
quality
to
the
painters
of
succeeding
centuries
as
the
subjects
of
their
striking
pictures
before
the
end
of
the
century
giotto
had
picked
out
some
of
the
most
interesting
of
these
for
the
decorative
illustration
of
the
upper
church
at
assisi
during
the
succeeding
century
the
author
of
the
little
flowers
of
francis
embodied
many
of
these
beautiful
scenes
in
his
little
work
where
they
have
been
the
favorite
reading
of
poets
for
many
centuries
since
it
should
not
be
such
a
surprise
as
it
might
otherwise
be
then
to
find
that
francis
may
be
considered
in
one
sense
as
the
father
of
the
modern
drama
the
story
is
a
very
pretty
one
and
has
an
additional
value
because
it
has
been
illustrated
by
no
less
a
brush
than
that
of
giotto
one
christmas
eve
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
francis
gathered
round
him
some
of
the
poor
people
living
outside
of
the
town
of
assisi
in
order
to
recall
vividly
to
them
the
great
event
which
had
taken
place
on
that
night
so
many
centuries
before
a
little
figure
of
a
child
dressed
in
swaddling
clothes
was
laid
on
some
straw
in
a
manger
with
the
breath
of
the
nearby
animals
to
warm
it
to
this
manger
throne
of
the
child
king
of
bethlehem
there
came
in
adoration
after
the
hymns
that
recalled
the
visit
first
some
of
the
shepherds
from
the
surrounding
country
and
then
some
of
the
country
people
who
represented
the
kings
from
the
east
with
their
retinues
bringing
with
them
their
royal
gifts
after
this
little
scene
probably
one
of
the
first
nativity
plays
that
had
ever
been
given
francis
according
to
the
old
legend
took
the
little
image
in
his
arms
and
in
an
excess
of
devotion
pressed
it
to
his
heart
according
to
the
story
the
infant
came
to
life
in
his
embrace
and
putting
its
little
arms
around
his
neck
embraced
him
in
return
of
course
our
modern
generation
is
entirely
too
devoted
to
common
sense
to
accept
any
such
pretty
pious
story
as
this
as
more
than
a
beautiful
poetic
legend
the
legend
has
provided
a
subject
for
poet
and
painter
many
a
time
in
subsequent
centuries
perhaps
never
has
it
been
used
with
better
effect
than
by
giotto
whose
representation
is
one
of
the
favorite
pictures
on
the
wall
of
the
upper
church
of
assisi
whether
the
little
baby
figure
of
the
play
actually
came
to
life
in
his
arms
or
not
we
do
not
know
but
one
thing
is
certain
that
infant
modern
dramatic
literature
did
come
to
life
at
the
moment
and
that
before
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
was
to
have
a
vigor
and
an
influence
that
made
it
one
of
the
great
factors
in
the
social
life
of
the
period
the
franciscans
were
soon
spread
over
the
world
with
filial
reverence
they
took
with
them
all
the
customs
of
their
loved
father
of
assisi
and
especially
such
as
appealed
to
the
masses
and
brought
home
to
them
in
a
vivid
way
the
great
truths
of
religion
by
the
middle
of
the
century
many
of
the
towns
had
cycles
of
mystery
plays
given
at
various
times
during
the
year
associated
with
the
different
feasts
and
illustrating
and
enforcing
the
lessons
of
the
liturgy
for
the
people
in
a
manner
so
effective
that
it
has
probably
never
been
equaled
before
or
since
while
the
most
potent
factor
in
the
dissemination
of
the
early
religious
drama
can
be
traced
to
francis
and
the
franciscans
they
were
but
promoters
of
a
movement
already
well
begun
mystery
plays
were
attempted
before
the
thirteenth
century
in
england
and
in
north
france
there
is
a
story
from
matthew
paris
who
wrote
about
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
of
one
geoffrey
who
afterwards
became
abbot
of
albans
while
yet
a
secular
he
borrowed
certain
precious
religious
vestments
to
be
used
in
some
sort
of
a
miracle
play
in
honor
of
catherine
during
the
performance
of
the
play
these
vestments
were
destroyed
by
fire
and
geogory
was
so
much
afflicted
by
the
misfortune
that
in
a
spirit
of
reparation
he
became
a
religious
in
the
abbey
of
albans
this
must
have
been
about
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century
towards
the
end
of
this
century
mystery
plays
were
not
infrequent
though
not
in
anything
like
the
developed
form
nor
popular
character
which
they
acquired
during
the
thirteenth
century
fitz
stephen
writing
the
life
of
thomas
a
becket
towards
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
contrasts
the
holier
plays
of
london
in
his
days
with
the
theatrical
spectacles
of
ancient
rome
the
plays
he
mentioned
were
however
scarcely
more
than
slight
developments
of
church
ceremonial
with
almost
literal
employment
of
scripture
and
liturgical
language
illustration
francis
nativity
play
giotto
the
first
cycle
of
mystery
plays
of
which
there
is
definite
mention
is
that
of
chester
according
to
the
proclamation
of
the
chester
plays
the
representation
of
this
cycle
dates
in
some
form
from
the
mayoralty
of
john
arneway
who
was
the
mayor
of
chester
between
and
of
the
series
of
plays
as
given
in
the
thirteenth
century
there
are
few
remains
it
is
probable
even
that
at
this
early
date
they
were
not
acted
in
english
but
in
french
english
plays
were
probably
first
given
in
some
of
the
cathedral
towns
along
the
east
coast
of
england
and
perhaps
york
should
have
the
credit
of
this
innovation
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
the
simpler
dramatic
additions
to
the
ritual
of
the
church
would
inevitably
develop
in
the
earnest
and
very
full
religious
life
of
the
people
which
came
with
the
building
of
the
cathedrals
the
evolution
of
church
ceremonial
and
the
social
life
fostered
by
the
of
the
time
while
we
have
none
of
the
remains
of
the
actual
plays
of
the
thirteenth
century
there
is
no
doubt
that
an
excellent
idea
of
their
form
and
content
can
be
gathered
from
the
english
mystery
plays
that
have
recently
been
edited
in
modern
form
and
which
serve
to
show
the
characteristics
of
the
various
cycles
it
might
perhaps
be
thought
that
these
mystery
plays
would
not
furnish
any
great
amount
of
entertainment
for
the
populace
especially
after
they
had
seen
them
a
certain
number
of
times
the
yearly
repetition
might
naturally
be
expected
to
bring
with
it
before
long
a
satiety
that
would
lead
to
inattention
as
is
well
known
however
there
is
an
enduring
interest
about
these
old
religious
stories
that
makes
them
of
much
greater
attractiveness
than
most
ordinary
historical
traditions
many
a
faithful
reader
of
the
bible
finds
constantly
renewed
interest
in
the
old
biblical
stories
in
spite
of
frequent
repetition
their
significance
to
the
eye
of
faith
in
the
middle
ages
gave
them
beyond
any
doubt
that
quality
which
in
any
literary
work
will
exemplify
and
fulfill
horace
dictum
repetita
besides
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
men
and
women
of
the
thirteenth
century
had
not
the
superficial
facilities
of
the
printing
press
to
cloy
their
intellectual
curiosity
and
by
trivial
titillation
make
them
constantly
crave
novelty
it
must
not
be
thought
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
these
were
religious
plays
that
they
were
always
so
serious
as
to
be
merely
instructive
without
being
amusing
a
large
fund
of
amusement
was
injected
into
the
old
biblical
stories
by
the
writers
of
the
different
cycles
and
undoubtedly
the
actors
themselves
added
certain
personal
elements
in
this
matter
which
still
further
enhanced
some
of
the
comical
aspects
of
the
solemn
stories
nearly
always
the
incidents
of
the
scriptural
narrative
though
followed
more
or
less
literally
were
treated
with
a
large
humanity
that
could
scarcely
fail
to
introduce
elements
of
humor
into
the
dramatic
performances
such
liberties
however
were
taken
only
with
characters
not
mentioned
by
the
bible
the
inventions
of
the
writers
a
series
of
quotations
from
the
chester
cycle
of
plays
will
best
illustrate
this
we
give
them
in
the
quaint
spelling
of
the
oldest
version
extant

is

this
quotation
will
give
a
good
idea
of
the
human
interest
of
these
mystery
plays
and
serve
to
show
that
they
did
not
fail
in
dramatic
power
for
any
lack
of
humor
or
acute
observation
it
would
be
easy
to
illustrate
this
much
more
amply
the
opportunities
to
enjoy
these
plays
were
abundant
we
have
said
that
the
chester
cycle
is
the
one
of
which
there
is
earliest
mention
the
method
of
its
presentation
has
been
described
by
henry
morley
in
the
fourth
volume
of
his
english
writers
he
says
there
were
scaffolds
erected
for
spectators
in
those
places
to
which
the
successive
pageants
would
be
drawn
and
a
citizen
who
on
the
first
day
saw
in
any
place
the
first
pageant
that
of
the
fall
of
lucifer
if
he
kept
his
place
and
returned
to
it
in
good
time
on
each
successive
morning
would
see
the
scripture
story
as
thus
told
pass
in
its
right
order
before
him
each
pageant
was
drawn
on
four
or
six
wheels
and
had
a
room
in
which
the
actors
and
properties
were
concealed
under
the
upper
room
or
stage
on
which
they
played
morley
then
describes
the
action
of
the
various
parts
of
the
cycle
showing
how
clearly
the
lessons
of
the
old
testament
history
and
its
symbolic
and
typical
meaning
were
pointed
out
so
that
the
spectators
could
not
miss
them
how
completely
the
story
of
the
bible
was
told
may
be
judged
from
the
order
of
the
pageants
of
the
play
of
corpus

the

of

can
be
judged
from
the
following
supplementary
list
of
the
other
trade
guilds
that
took
parts
many
of

bear
quaint
names
which
are
now
obsolete
they
included
the
girdellers
makers
of

nailers
sawyers
lorymers
bridle

the
spurriers
makers

the
fevers

the
men
of

however
menial
it
may
seem
to
us
were
barred
each
of
these
companies
had
a
special
pageant
with
a
portion
of
the
old
or
new
testament
to
represent
and
in
each
succeeding
year
spent
much
of
their
spare
time
in
preparing
for
their
dramatic
performance
studying
and
practising
their
parts
and
making
everything
ready
for
competition
with
their
brother
craftsmen
in
the
other
pageants
only
those
who
know
the
supreme
educative
value
of
dramatic
representations
for
those
actively
interested
in
them
will
appreciate
all
that
these
plays
meant
for
popular
education
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
but
all
can
readily
understand
how
much
they
stood
for
in
popular
occupation
of
mind
with
high
thoughts
and
how
much
they
must
have
acted
as
a
preventive
of
debasing
dissipations
it
is
extremely
interesting
to
follow
out
some
of
the
details
of
the
management
of
these
mystery
plays
we
shall
find
in
even
the
meagre
accounts
that
we
have
of
them
sufficient
to
show
us
that
men
were
not
expected
to
work
for
nothing
nor
even
to
be
satisfied
with
what
compensation
there
might
be
in
the
honor
of
being
chosen
for
certain
parts
nor
in
the
special
banquets
that
were
provided
for
the
actors
after
the
performances
a
definite
salary
was
paid
to
each
of
the
actors
according
to
the
importance
of
the
part
he
took
not
only
this
but
the
loans
of
garments
for
costume
purposes
or
of
furniture
or
other
material
for
stage
properties
was
repaid
by
definite
sums
of
money
these
are
not
large
but
considering
the
buying
power
of
money
at
that
time
and
the
wages
paid
workmen
which
enabled
them
to
live
at
least
as
well
comparatively
as
modern
workmen
the
compensation
is
ample
morley
in
the
fourth
volume
of
his
english
writers
has
given
us
some
of
these
details
and
as
they
have
a
special
social
interest
and
the
old
documents
rejoice
in
a
comic
literalness
of
statement
they
deserve
citation
when
about
to
set
up
a
play
each
guild
chose
for
itself
a
competent
manager
to
whom
it
gave
the
rule
of
the
pageant
and
voted
a
fixed
sum
for
its
expenses
the
and
the
standing
wardrobe
and
other
properties
were
handed
over
to
him
and
he
was
accountable
of
course
for
their
return
after
the
close
of
the
performances
the
manager
had
to
appoint
his
actors
to
give
them
their
several
parts
written
out
for
them
perhaps
by
the
prompter
who
was
a
regular
official
and
to
see
to
the
rehearsals
of
which
there
would
be
two
for
an
old
play
and
at
least
five
for
a
new
one
at
rehearsal
time
as
well
as
during
the
great
performance
the
actors
ate
and
drank
at
the
cost
of
the
guild
ending
all
with
a
supper
at
which
they
had
roast
beef
and
roast
goose
with
wine
for
the
chiefs
and
beer
for
the
rest
the
actors
were
paid
of
course
according
to
the
length
of
their
parts
and
quantity
of
business
in
them
not
their
dignity
thus
in
a
play
setting
forth
the
trial
and
crucifixion
of
our
lord
the
actors
of
herod
and
caiaphas
received
each
the
representative
of
annas
and
of
christ
which
was
also
the
sum
paid
to
each
actor
in
the
parts
of
his
executioners
and
more
than
was
paid
for
acting
the
devil
or
judas
in
the
united
plays
of
the
descent
into
hell
and
the
ascension
the
payment
was
to
the
actor
who
represented
christ
and
to
him
who
played
the
devil
in
one
play
we
find
this
gradation
of
the
scale
of
payment
to
performers
paid
for
playing
of
peter
xvid
to
two

a

clear
notion
is
also
to
be
drawn
from
the
coventry

which

printed
all
that

no

prepared

the
costume
of
each
part
was
traditional
varied
little
in
the
course
of
years
and
much
of
it
was
originally
designed
after
the
pictures
and
painted
sculpture
in
the
churches
as
in
those
medieval
decorations
gilding
was
used
freely
the
performer
of
christ
wore
a
gilt
peruke
and
beard
so
did
peter
and
probably
all
the
apostles
or
saints
who
would
be
represented
on
church
walls
with
a
gilt
nimbus
christ
coat
was
of
white
painted
and
gilded
with
a
girdle
and
red
sandals
the
part
of
the
high
priests
caiaphas
and
annas
were
often
played
in
ecclesiastical
robes
hired
from
a
church
a
practice
one
sad
result
of
which
because
of
fire
has
already
been
noted
that
was
eventually
condemned
as
likely
to
lead
to
disrespect
for
sacred
objects
herod
who
wore
a
mask
was
set
up
as
a
sceptred
royal
warrior
in
a
gilt
and
silvered
helmet
in
armour
and
gown
of
blue
satin
with
such
saracen
details
of
dress
as
the
crusaders
connected
with
the
worship
of
mahomet
including
the
crooked
faulchion
which
was
gilt
the
tormentors
of
christ
wore
jackets
of
black
buckram
with
nails
and
dice
upon
them
the
virgin
mary
was
crowned
as
in
her
images
the
angels
wore
white
surplices
and
wings
the
devil
also
had
wings
and
was
played
in
an
appropriate
mask
and
leather
dress
trimmed
with
feathers
and
hair
he
was
as
the
prologue
to
the
chester
plays
describes
him
the
devil
in
his
feathers
all
ragged
and
rent
or
as
the
coventry
show
carried
three
pounds
of
hair
upon
his
hose
there
was
probably
no
greater
impulse
for
social
uplift
and
for
real
education
of
the
masses
than
these
mystery
and
morality
plays
in
which
the
people
took
part
themselves
and
in
which
as
a
consequence
of
the
presence
of
friends
in
the
various
roles
the
spectators
had
a
livelier
interest
than
would
have
been
otherwise
the
case
under
even
the
most
favorable
circumstances
or
with
elaborate
presentation
in
recent
years
there
has
come
the
realization
that
the
drama
may
thus
be
made
a
real
educational
influence
unfortunately
at
the
present
time
whatever
of
influence
it
has
is
exerted
almost
exclusively
upon
the
classes
who
have
so
many
other
opportunities
for
educational
uplift
these
plays
during
the
thirteenth
century
brought
the
people
intimately
into
contact
with
the
great
characters
of
old
testament
and
new
testament
history
and
besides
giving
them
precious
religious
information
which
of
itself
however
might
mean
very
little
for
true
education
helped
them
to
an
insight
into
character
and
to
a
right
appreciation
of
human
actions
and
a
sympathy
with
what
was
right
even
though
it
entailed
suffering
such
as
could
not
have
otherwise
been
obtained
of
course
it
is
easy
to
say
that
such
dramas
constantly
repeated
the
subjects
always
the
same
and
only
the
cast
varying
from
year
to
year
would
become
intolerably
familiar
and
might
after
a
time
degenerate
into
the
merely
contemptible
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
they
did
not
these
old
stories
of
religious
heroes
were
written
so
close
to
the
heart
of
nature
involved
so
intimately
all
the
problems
of
life
that
they
are
of
undying
interest
their
repetition
was
only
from
year
to
year
and
this
did
not
give
the
opportunity
for
the
familiarity
which
breeds
contempt
besides
though
the
plays
in
the
various
cycles
existed
in
definite
forms
there
seems
no
doubt
that
certain
changes
were
made
by
the
players
themselves
and
by
the
managers
of
the
plays
from
time
to
time
and
indeed
such
changes
of
the
text
of
a
play
as
we
know
from
experience
are
almost
inevitable
it
might
be
urged
too
that
the
people
themselves
would
scarcely
be
possessed
of
the
histrionic
talent
necessary
to
make
the
plays
effective
ordinarily
however
as
we
know
from
our
modern
city
life
much
less
of
the
actor
art
is
needed
than
of
interest
in
the
action
to
secure
the
attention
of
the
gallery
it
must
not
be
assumed
too
readily
however
that
the
guilds
which
were
able
to
supply
men
for
the
great
artistic
decoration
of
the
cathedrals
of
the
thirteenth
century
could
not
supply
actors
who
would
so
enter
into
the
artistic
expression
of
a
part
as
to
represent
it
to
the
life
the
actor
is
more
born
than
made
in
spite
of
the
number
of
schools
of
acting
that
are
supposed
to
be
turning
out
successful
rivals
of
roscius
on
recurring
graduation
days
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
only
example
of
these
mystery
plays
which
is
still
left
to
us
is
the
passion
play
at
oberammergau
and
that
is
one
of
the
world
greatest
spectacles
on
the
last
occasion
when
it
was
given
about
half
a
million
of
people
from
all
over
the
world
many
of
them
even
from
distant
america
and
australia
found
their
way
into
the
tyrolese
mountains
in
order
to
be
present
at
it
it
is
only
the
old
old
old
story
of
the
passion
and
death
of
the
lord
it
is
represented
by
villagers
chosen
from
among
the
inhabitants
of
a
little
village
of
fourteen
hundred
inhabitants
who
while
they
have
a
distinct
taste
for
the
artistic
and
produce
some
of
the
best
done
anywhere
in
europe
thus
approximating
very
interestingly
the
thirteenth
century
peoples
are
not
particularly
noted
for
their
education
nor
for
their
dramatic
ability
no
one
who
went
up
to
see
the
passion
play
came
away
dissatisfied
either
with
the
interest
of
the
play
or
with
its
manner
of
representation
it
is
distinctly
an
example
of
how
well
men
and
women
do
things
when
they
are
thoroughly
interested
in
them
and
when
they
are
under
the
influence
of
an
tradition
according
to
which
they
must
have
the
ability
to
accomplish
what
is
expected
of
them
such
a
tradition
actually
existed
during
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
leading
to
a
gradual
development
of
dramatic
power
both
in
writers
and
actors
that
eventually
was
to
result
in
the
magnificent
outburst
of
dramatic
genius
during
the
elizabethan
period
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
mystery
and
morality
plays
continued
to
hold
the
stage
down
almost
if
not
quite
to
the
time
of
shakespeare
early
manhood
and
he
probably
saw
the
coventry
cycle
of
plays
acted
while
we
have
a
certain
number
of
these
plays
most
of
them
of
course
have
disappeared
by
time
attrition
during
the
centuries
before
the
invention
of
printing
when
they
were
handed
round
only
in
manuscript
form
of
some
of
these
plays
we
shall
have
something
to
say
after
a
moment
stopping
only
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
this
literary
mode
of
the
mystery
and
morality
plays
dramatic
literature
in
english
reached
a
height
of
development
which
has
been
equaled
only
by
our
greatest
dramatic
geniuses
within
the
last
few
years
most
of
the
large
cities
of
the
world
besides
the
more
important
universities
have
been
given
the
opportunity
to
hear
one
of
the
great
products
of
this
form
of
literary
activity
everyman
is
probably
as
great
a
play
as
there
is
in
english
and
comparable
with
the
best
work
of
shakespeare
marlowe
and
jonson
its
author
only
took
the
four
last
things
to
be
remembered
death
judgment
heaven
and
hell
the
things
which
must
come
to
every
man
and
wrote
his
story
around
them
yet
he
did
it
with
such
artistic
effectiveness
as
to
make
his
drama
a
triumph
of
literary
execution
the
mystery
plays
were
as
interesting
in
their
way
to
the
medieval
generations
as
everyman
to
us
as
may
be
seen
from
the
list
quoted
from
morley
practically
all
the
significant
parts
of
the
bible
story
were
acted
by
these
craftsmen
too
much
can
scarcely
be
said
of
the
educational
value
of
such
dramatic
exercises
the
bible
itself
with
its
deep
religious
teachings
with
its
simple
but
sublime
style
with
its
beautiful
poetry
entered
for
a
time
into
the
very
lives
of
these
people
no
wonder
that
our
english
speech
during
these
centuries
became
saturated
with
biblical
thoughts
and
words
anyone
who
has
ever
had
any
experience
with
amateur
theatricals
when
a
really
great
play
was
given
will
be
able
to
realize
how
much
more
thoroughly
every
quality
dramatic
literary
poetic
even
lyric
and
historical
that
there
might
be
in
the
drama
entered
into
the
hearts
and
minds
of
those
who
took
part
it
is
this
feature
that
is
especially
deserving
of
attention
with
regard
to
these
mystery
plays
which
began
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
people
interest
in
them
lifted
them
out
of
themselves
and
their
trivial
round
of
life
into
the
higher
life
of
this
great
religious
poetry
on
the
other
hand
the
teachings
of
the
bible
came
down
from
the
distant
plane
on
which
they
might
otherwise
have
been
set
and
entered
into
the
very
life
of
the
people
their
familiarity
with
scripture
made
it
a
something
not
to
be
discussed
merely
but
to
be
applied
in
their
everyday
affairs
besides
this
the
organization
of
the
company
to
give
the
play
and
the
necessity
for
the
display
and
exercise
of
taste
in
the
costumes
and
of
ingenuity
in
the
stage
settings
were
of
themselves
of
great
educative
value
the
rivalry
that
naturally
existed
between
the
various
companies
chosen
from
the
different
guilds
only
added
to
the
zest
with
which
rehearsals
were
taken
up
and
made
the
play
more
fully
occupy
the
minds
of
those
actively
engaged
in
its
preparation
for
several
dull
winter
months
before
easter
time
there
was
an
intense
preoccupation
of
mind
with
great
thoughts
and
beautiful
words
instead
of
with
the
paltry
round
of
daily
duties
which
would
otherwise
form
the
burden
of
conversation
gossip
and
scandal
mongering
had
fewer
opportunities
since
people
minds
were
taken
up
by
so
much
worthier
affairs
the
towns
in
which
the
plays
were
given
never
had
more
than
a
few
thousand
inhabitants
and
most
of
them
must
have
been
personally
interested
in
some
way
in
the
play
the
jesuits
whose
acumen
for
managing
students
is
proverbial
have
always
considered
it
of
great
importance
to
have
their
students
prepare
plays
several
times
a
year
their
reason
is
the
occupation
of
mind
which
it
affords
as
well
as
the
intellectual
and
elocutionary
training
that
comes
with
the
work
what
they
do
with
premeditation
the
old
guilds
did
unconsciously
but
even
more
effectively
and
their
success
must
be
considered
as
one
of
the
social
triumphs
of
this
wonderful
thirteenth
century
only
in
recent
years
has
the
idea
succeeded
in
making
way
in
government
circles
on
the
continent
that
the
giving
of
free
dramatic
entertainments
for
the
poor
would
form
an
excellent
addition
to
other
educational
procedures
such
performances
have
new
been
given
for
nearly
a
score
of
years
in
berlin
after
all
the
subvention
allowed
by
government
to
the
great
theaters
and
opera
houses
in
europe
is
part
of
this
same
policy
though
unfortunately
they
are
calculated
to
affect
only
the
upper
classes
who
need
the
help
and
the
stimulus
of
great
dramatic
art
and
great
music
less
than
the
lower
classes
who
have
so
little
of
variety
or
of
anything
that
makes
for
uplift
in
their
lives
in
the
thirteenth
century
this
very
modern
notion
was
anticipated
in
such
a
way
as
to
benefit
the
very
poorest
of
the
population
and
that
not
only
passively
that
is
by
the
hearing
of
dramatic
performances
but
also
actively
by
taking
parts
in
them
and
so
having
all
the
details
of
the
action
and
the
words
impressed
upon

francis

the
renaissance
is
often
thought
of
as
a
movement
which
originated
about
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
careful
students
sometimes
trace
its
origin
back
somewhat
further
in
recent
years
it
has
come
to
be
realized
however
that
the
great
intellectual
development
which
came
during
the
century
after
the
fall
of
constantinople
in
italy
and
gradually
spread
to
all
the
civilized
countries
of
europe
had
been
preparing
for
at
least
two
centuries
and
a
half
while
the
period
from
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
to
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
centuries
well
deserves
the
name
of
renaissance
because
one
of
the
most
important
fructifying
principles
of
the
movement
was
the
rebirth
of
greek
ideas
into
the
modern
world
after
the
dispersion
of
greek
scholars
by
the
turkish
advance
into
the
byzantine
empire
the
term
must
not
be
allowed
to
carry
with
it
the
mistaken
notion
which
only
too
often
has
been
plausibly
accepted
that
there
was
a
new
birth
of
poetic
literary
and
esthetic
ideas
at
this
time
just
as
if
there
had
been
nothing
worth
considering
in
these
lines
before
any
such
notion
as
this
would
be
the
height
of
absurdity
in
the
light
of
the
history
of
the
previous
centuries
in
italy
it
was
a
cherished
notion
of
the
people
of
the
renaissance
themselves
that
they
were
the
first
to
do
artistic
and
literary
work
hence
they
invented
the
term
gothic
meaning
thereby
barbarous
for
the
art
of
the
preceding
time
but
in
this
they
were
only
exercising
that
amusing
which
each
generation
deems
its
right
succeeding
generations
adopting
their
depreciative
term
have
turned
it
into
one
of
glory
so
that
gothic
art
is
now
in
highest
honor
fortunately
in
recent
years
there
has
come
as
we
have
said
a
growing
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
real
beginning
of
modern
art
lies
much
farther
back
in
history
and
that
the
real
father
of
the
italian
renaissance
is
a
man
whom
very
few
people
in
the
last
three
centuries
have
appreciated
at
his
true
worth
undoubtedly
the
leader
in
that
great
return
to
nature
which
constitutes
the
true
basis
of
modern
poetic
and
artistic
ideas
of
all
kinds
was
francis
of
assisi
the
poor
little
man
of
god
as
in
his
humility
he
loved
to
call
himself
would
surely
be
the
last
one
to
suspect
that
he
should
ever
come
to
be
thought
of
as
the
initiator
of
a
great
movement
in
literature
and
art
such
he
was
however
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
term
and
because
of
the
modern
appreciation
of
him
in
this
regard
publications
concerning
him
have
been
more
frequent
during
the
last
ten
years
than
with
regard
to
almost
any
other
single
individual
we
have
under
our
hand
at
the
present
moment
what
by
no
means
claims
to
be
a
complete
bibliography
of
francis
life
and
work
yet
we
can
count
no
less
than
thirty
different
works
in
various
languages
not
reckoning
translations
separate
from
the
originals
which
have
issued
from
the
press
during
the
last
ten
years
alone
this
gives
some
idea
of
present
day
interest
in
francis
it
must
not
be
thought
however
that
it
is
only
in
our
time
that
these
significant
tributes
have
been
paid
him
much
of
his
influence
in
literature
and
art
as
well
as
in
life
was
recognized
by
the
southern
nations
all
during
the
centuries
since
his
death
that
it
is
only
during
the
last
century
that
other
nations
have
come
to
appreciate
him
better
and
especially
have
realized
his
literary
significance
has
been
their
loss
and
that
of
their
literatures
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
görres
the
german
historian
who
was
so
sympathetic
towards
the
middle
ages
wrote
of
francis
as
one
of
the
troubadours
and
even
did
not
hesitate
to
add
that
without
francis
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
there
would
have
been
no
dante
at
the
end
renan
the
french
rationalist
historian
and
literateur
did
not
hesitate
to
proclaim
francis
one
of
the
great
religious
poets
of
all
time
and
his
famous
canticle
of
the
sun
as
the
greatest
religious
poem
since
the
hebrew
psalms
were
written
it
was
from
renan
that
matthew
arnold
received
his
introduction
to
francis
as
a
literary
man
and
his
own
studies
led
him
to
write
the
famous
passages
in
the
essays
in
criticism
which
are
usually
so
much
a
source
of
surprise
to
those
who
think
of
arnold
as
the
rationalizing
critic
rather
than
the
sympathetic
admirer
of
a
medieval
saint
in
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
when
the
clouds
and
storms
had
come
when
the
gay
sensuous
pagan
life
was
gone
when
men
were
not
living
by
the
senses
and
understanding
when
they
were
looking
for
the
speedy
coming
of
antichrist
there
appeared
in
italy
to
the
north
of
rome
in
the
beautiful
umbrian
country
at
the
foot
of
the
appennines
a
figure
of
the
most
magical
power
and
charm
francis
his
century
is
i
think
the
most
interesting
in
the
history
of
christianity
after
its
primitive
age
more
interesting
than
even
the
century
of
the
reformation
and
one
of
the
chief
figures
perhaps
the
very
chief
to
which
this
interest
attaches
itself
is
francis
and
why
because
of
the
profound
popular
instinct
which
enabled
him
more
than
any
man
since
the
primitive
age
to
fit
religion
for
popular
use
he
brought
religion
to
the
people
he
founded
the
most
popular
body
of
ministers
of
religion
that
has
ever
existed
in
the
church
he
transformed
monachism
by
uprooting
the
stationary
monk
delivering
him
from
the
bondage
of
property
and
sending
him
as
a
mendicant
friar
to
be
a
stranger
and
sojourner
not
in
the
wilderness
but
in
the
most
crowded
haunts
of
men
to
console
them
and
to
do
them
good
this
popular
instinct
of
his
is
at
the
bottom
of
his
famous
marriage
with
poverty
poverty
and
suffering
are
the
condition
of
the
people
the
multitude
the
immense
majority
of
mankind
and
it
was
towards
this
people
that
his
soul
yearned
he
listens
it
was
said
of
him
to
those
to
whom
god
himself
will
not
listen
matthew
arnold
has
thus
surprisingly
summed
up
francis
age
and
his
work
with
a
sympathy
that
could
scarcely
be
expected
from
the
man
for
whom
the
deity
had
become
merely
a
stream
of
tendency
that
makes
for
righteousness
he
realized
the
influence
that
this
supreme
lover
of
a
personal
god
had
over
his
generation
and
his
brother
poet
soul
flew
to
its
affinity
in
spite
of
the
apparently
insurmountable
obstacle
extreme
aloofness
of
spiritual
temperament

glorification
of
francis
giotto
lower
church
of

matthew
arnold
proceeds
so
in
return
as
no
other
man
francis
was
listened
to
when
an
umbrian
town
or
village
heard
of
his
approach
the
whole
population
went
out
in
joyful
procession
to
meet
him
with
green
boughs
flags
music
and
songs
of
gladness
the
master
who
began
with
two
disciples
could
in
his
own
lifetime
and
he
died
at
collect
to
keep
whitsuntide
with
him
in
presence
of
an
immense
multitude
five
thousand
of
his
minorites

found
fulfilment
to
his
prophetic
cry

when
we
reach
the
next
paragraph
the
secret
of
this
surprising
paradoxical
sympathy
is
out
it
is
the
literary
and
esthetic
side
of
francis
that
has
appealed
to
him
and
like
renan
he
does
not
hesitate
to
give
the
poor
little
man
of
god
a
place
among
the
great
original
geniuses
of
all
time
associating
his
name
with
that
of
dante
prose
could
not
satisfy
this
ardent
soul
and
he
made
poetry
latin
was
too
learned
for
this
simple
popular
nature
and
he
composed
in
his
mother
tongue
in
italian
the
beginnings
of
the
mundane
poetry

the
italians

in

it

not
for
use

matches
with
the
childlike
genius

the
simple
natures

loved
and
repeated
it
probably
the
most
satisfactory
translation
for
those
who
may
not
be
able
to
appreciate
the
original
of
this
sublime
hymn
that
has
evoked
so
many
tributes
is
the

literal
rendering

a
quite
successful
attempt

give
the
naif
rhythm

disappears

my
lord
and
give
him
thanks
and
be
subject
unto
him
with
great
humility
except
for
his
place
in
literature
and
art
the
lives
of
few
men
would
seem
to
be
of
so
little
interest
to
the
modern
time
as
that
of
francis
of
assisi
yet
it
is
for
the
man
himself
that
so
many
now
turn
to
him
his
spirit
is
entirely
opposed
to
the
sordid
principles
that
have
been
accepted
as
the
basis
of
success
in
modern
life
his
idea
was
that
happiness
consisted
in
being
free
from
unsatisfied
desires
rather
than
seeking
to
secure
the
satisfaction
of
his
wishes
duty
was
not
under
any
pretext
he
stripped
himself
literally
of
everything
and
his
mystic
marriage
to
the
lady
poverty
was
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
as
absolute
a
reality
as
if
the
union
had
been
actual
instead
of
imaginary
the
commonplace
details
of
his
early
years
seem
all
the
more
interesting
from
these
later
developments
and
have
been
the
subject
of
much
sympathetic
study
in
recent
years
francis
father
was
a
cloth
merchant
and
francis
had
been
brought
up
and
educated
as
became
the
son
of
a
man
whose
commercial
journeys
often
took
him
to
france
it
was
indeed
while
his
father
was
absent
on
one
of
these
business
expeditions
that
francis
was
born
and
on
his
father
return
received
from
him
the
name
of
francisco
the
frenchman
in
joyful
commemoration
of
his
birth
as
he
grew
up
he
did
not
differ
from
the
ordinary
young
man
of
his
time
but
seems
to
have
taken
the
world
and
its
pleasures
quite
as
he
found
them
and
after
the
fashion
of
those
around
him
at
the
age
of
he
fell
seriously
ill
and
then
for
the
first
time
there
came
to
him
the
realization
of
the
true
significance
of
life
as
dean
stanley
said
shortly
before
his
death
life
seemed
different
when
viewed
from
the
horizontal
position
life
lived
for
its
own
sake
was
not
worth
while
to
francis
there
came
the
realization
that
when
god
himself
became
man
he
lived
his
life
for
others
francis
set
about
literally
imitating
him
enthusiastic
students
of
his
life
consider
him
the
great
type
of
genuine
christian
the
most
real
disciple
of
christ
who
ever
lived
some
money
and
goods
that
came
into
his
hands
having
been
disposed
of
for
the
poor
francis
father
made
serious
objection
and
francis
was
brought
before
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
it
was
at
this
moment
that
he
stripped
himself
of
everything
that
he
had
the
bishop
even
having
to
provide
a
cloak
to
cover
his
nakedness
and
became
the
wonderful
apostle
to
the
poor
that
he
remained
during
all
the
rest
of
his
life
curious
as
it
must
ever
seem
it
was
not
long
before
he
had
many
who
wished
to
imitate
him
and
who
insisted
on
becoming
his
disciples
and
followers
francis
had
had
no
idea
how
infectious
his
example
was
to
prove
before
his
death
his
disciples
could
be
numbered
by
the
thousands
and
the
great
order
of
the
franciscans
that
for
centuries
was
to
do
so
much
work
had
come
into
existence
not
by
any
conscious
planning
but
by
the
mere
force
of
the
great
christian
principles
that
were
the
guiding
factors
in
francis
own
life
ruskin
in
his
mornings
in
florence
in
discussing
giotto
famous
picture
of
francis
renunciation
of
his
inheritance
and
his
incurrence
thereby
of
his
father
anger
has
a
characteristic
passage
that
sounds
the
very
keynote
of
the
saint
life
and
goes
to
the
heart
of
things
in
it
he
explains
the
meaning
of
this
apparently
contradictory
incident
in
francis
life
since
francis
great
virtue
was
obedience
yet
here
apparently
as
a
beginning
of
his
more
perfect
christian
life
is
an
act
of
disobedience
after
explanation
however
it
is
all
the
more
difficult
to
understand
the
present
generation
revival
of
interest
in
francis
unless
it
be
attributed
to
a
liking
for
contrast
that
is
the
meaning
of
francis
renouncing
his
inheritance
and
it
is
the
beginning
of
giotto
gospel
of
works
unless
this
hardest
of
deeds
be
done
first
this
inheritance
of
mammon
and
the
world
cast
away
all
other
deeds
are
useless
you
can
not
serve
can
not
obey
god
and
mammon
no
charities
no
obedience
no
are
of
any
use
while
you
are
still
at
heart
in
conformity
with
the
world
you
go
to
church
because
the
world
goes
you
keep
sunday
because
your
neighbor
keeps
it
but
you
dress
ridiculously
because
your
neighbors
ask
it
and
you
dare
not
do
a
rough
piece
of
work
because
your
neighbors
despise
it
you
must
renounce
your
neighbor
in
his
riches
and
pride
and
remember
him
in
his
distress
that

charming
explanation
of

place
in

most
people
will
only
find
it
more
difficult
after
these
explanations
to
understand
the
modern
acute
reawakening
of
interest
in
francis

ardent
devotion
to
the
things

does
not

and

the
mystery
of
francis
attraction
only
deepens
the
more
we
know
of
him
an
american
franciscan
has
tried
to
solve
the
problem
and
his
words
are
worth
quoting
father
paschal
robinson
in
his
the
true
francis
says
what
is
the
cause
of
the
present
widespread
homage
to
francis
it
is
of
course
far
too
wide
a
question
to
allow
the
present
writer
to
do
more
than
make
a
few
suggestions
first
and
foremost
we
must
ever
reckon
with
the
perennial
charm
of
the
personality
which
seems
to
wield
an
ineffable
influence
over
the
hearts
of
men
drawing
and
holding
those
of
the
most
different
habits
of
mind
with
a
sense
of
personal
sympathy
perhaps
no
other
man
unless
it
be
paul
ever
had
such
wide
reaching
sympathy
and
it
may
have
been
wider
than
paul
for
we
find
no
evidence
in
the
great
apostle
of
a
love
for
nature
and
of
animals
this
exquisite
franciscan
spirit
as
it
is
called
which
is
the
very
perfume
of
religion
this
spirit
at
once
so
humble
so
tender
so
devout
so
akin
to
good
odor
of
christ
passed
out
into
the
whole
world
and
has
become
a
permanent
source
of
inspiration
a
character
at
once
so
exhalted
and
so
purified
as
francis
was
sure
to
keep
alive
an
ideal
and
so
he
does
from
this
one
can
easily
understand
francis
dominance
among
a
small
but
earnest
band
of
enthusiasts
now
pointing
the
world
back
to
the
reign
of
the
spirit
it
was
this
same
gentle
idealism
of
francis
which
inspired
the
art
of
the
umbrian
people
it
was
this
which
was
translated
into
the
paintings
of
the
greatest
artists
no
school
of
painting
has
ever
been
penetrated
with
such
pure
idealism
as
the
umbrian
and
this
inspiration
at
once
religious
and
artistic
came
from
the
tomb
of
the
above
which
giotto
had
painted
his
mystical
frescoes
the
earnest
study
of
the
medieval
beginnings
of
western
art
has
therefore
rightly
been
set
down
as
another
cause
for
some
of
the
pilgrimages
to
assisi
in
like
manner
the
scientific
treatment
of
the
romance
literature
leads
naturally
to
francis
as
to
the
humble
upper
waters
of
a
mighty
stream
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
francis
at
the
end
is
dante
it
was
matthew
arnold
we
believe
who
first
held
up
the
poor
man
of
assisi
as
a
literary
type
a
type
as
distinct
and
formal
as
the
author
of
the
he
says
not
easily
satisfy
the
saint
ardent
soul
and
so
he
made
poetry
was
writes
ozanam
first
cry
of
a
nascent
poetry
which
has
grown
and
made
itself
heard
through
the
world
considering
how
thoroughly
impractical
francis
seemed
to
be
in
his
life
it
can
scarcely
help
but
be
a
source
of
ever
increasing
wonder
that
he
succeeded
in
influencing
his
generation
so
widely
and
so
thoroughly
it
is
evident
that
there
were
many
men
of
the
time
tired
of
the
more
or
less
strenuous
life
which
chained
them
either
to
the
cares
of
business
or
tempted
them
for
the
sake
of
the
bubble
reputation
into
a
military
career
to
these
francis
method
of
life
came
with
an
especially
strong
appeal
the
example
of
his
neglect
of
worldly
things
and
of
his
so
thoroughly
maintained
resolve
not
to
be
harassed
by
the
ordinary
cares
of
life
and
especially
not
to
take
too
much
thought
of
the
future
penetrated
into
all
classes
while
it
made
the
rich
realize
how
much
of
their
lives
they
were
living
merely
for
the
sake
of
others
it
helped
the
poor
to
be
satisfied
since
here
was
a
sublime
and
complete
recognition
of
the
fact
that
an
existence
without
cares
was
better
than
one
with
many
cares
such
as
were
sure
to
come
to
those
who
wrought
ever
and
anon
increase
of
the
goods
of
this
world
such
ideas
may
seen
to
be
essentially
modern
but
anyone
who
will
turn
to
the
chapter
on
the
three
most
read
books
of
the
century
and
read
the
passages
from
the
romance
of
the
rose
on
wealth
and
poverty
will
know
better
than
to
think
them
anything
but
perennial
men
gathered
around
francis
then
and
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
follow
his
mode
of
life
some
of
the
men
who
thus
came
to
him
were
the
choice
spirits
of
the
times
thomas
of
celano
who
was
to
be
one
of
the
master
favorite
disciples
and
subsequently
to
be
his
most
authoritative
biographer
was
one
of
the
great
literary
geniuses
of
all
times
the
author
of
the
sublime
dies
irae
while
most
of
his
first
companions
were
men
of
such
extreme
simplicity
of
mind
that
the
world
has
been
rather
in
an
amused
than
admiring
attitude
with
regard
to
them
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
simplicity
was
of
itself
an
index
not
only
of
their
genuine
sincerity
of
heart
but
of
a
greatness
of
mind
that
set
them
above
the
ordinary
run
of
mankind
and
made
them
live
poetry
when
they
did
not
write
it
the
institute
established
by
francis
was
destined
in
the
course
of
the
century
to
attract
to
it
some
of
the
great
men
of
every
country
besides
thomas
of
celano
there
was
in
italy
anthony
of
padua
almost
as
famous
as
his
master

the
beauty
of
his
saintly
life

of
philosophy
and

at

and
the
writer
of
some
of
the
sublimest
treatises
of
mystical
theology
that
were
to
be
text
books
for
the
members
of
the
franciscan
order
and
of
many
other
religious
bodies
for
centuries
after
his
death
indeed
down
to
even
our
own
times
there
was
roger
bacon
in
england
the
famous
teacher
of
science
at
paris
and
at
oxford
and
that
subtle
doctor
duns
scotus
whose
influence
in
philosophical
speculation
was
destined
never
quite
to
disappear
and
many
others
the
pick
of
the
generations
in
which
they
lived
all
proud
to
look
up
to
francis
of
assisi
as
their
father
all
glad
of
the
opportunity
that
the
order
gave
them
to
pass
their
lives
in
peace
far
from
the
madding
crowd
with
its
strifes
and
competition
providing
them
constantly
with
opportunities
to
live
their
own
lives
to
find
their
own
souls
to
cultivate
their
own
individualities
untrammelled
by
worldly
cares
francis
success
in
this
matter
and
the
propaganda
of
his
influence
will
not
be
so
surprising
to
americans
of
this
generation
if
they
will
only
recall
what
is
still
a
precious
memory
in
the
minds
of
men
who
are
yet
alive
that
efforts
to
found
a
community
not
unlike
that
of
the
franciscans
in
certain
ways
attracted
widespread
attention
even
in
our
own
country
half
a
century
ago
after
all
the
men
who
gathered
at
brook
farm
had
ideas
and
ideals
not
so
distant
from
those
cherished
by
francis
and
the
early
members
of
the
franciscan
order
their
main
effort
was
also
to
get
away
from
worldly
cares
and
have
the
opportunity
to
work
out
their
philosophy
of
life
far
from
the
disturbing
influence
of
city
life
in
the
peaceful
pursuit
of
only
such
agricultural
efforts
as
might
be
necessary
to
ensure
them
simple
sustenance
yet
at
the
same
time
enforce
from
them
such
exercise
in
the
open
air
as
would
guarantee
the
preservation
of
health
the
men
of
brook
farm
were
in
the
eyes
of
their
generation
quite
as
far
from
practical
ideas
as
were
the
early
franciscans
it
must
not
be
forgotten
however
that
these
men
who
thus
attempted
in
the
nineteenth
century
what
francis
succeeded
in
accomplishing
in
the
thirteenth
in
their
subsequent
careers
succeeded
in
impressing
themselves
very
strongly
upon
the
life
of
the
american
people
much
of
what
is
best
in
our
nineteenth
century
life
would
be
lost
if
the
brook
farmers
and
what
they
accomplished
were
to
be
removed
from
it
men
of
ideals
are
usually
also
men
of
working
ideas
as
these
two
experiences
in
history
would
seem
to
show
illustration

it
was
not
alone
for
the
men
of
his
generation
however
that
francis
was
destined
to
furnish
a
refuge
from
worldly
care
and
a
place
of
peace
and
thoughtful
life
we
have
already
said
that
it
was
by
chance
certainly
without
any
conscious
intention
on
francis
part
that
the
franciscan
order
for
men
which
is
usually
spoken
of
as
the
first
order
came
into
existence
the
last
thing
in
the
world
very
probably
that
would
ever
have
entered
into
the
mind
of
francis
when
he
began
to
lead
the
simple
life
of
a
poor
little
man
of
god
was
the
founding
of
a
religious
order
for
women
we
tell
elsewhere
the
story
of
interest
in
francis
mode
of
life
and
of
the
trials
that
she
underwent
in
order
to
obtain
permission
and
opportunity
to
fashion
her
own
life
in
the
same
way
the
problem
was
even
more
serious
for
women
than
for
men
francis
considered
that
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
follow
the
franciscan
custom
of
going
out
to
seek
alms
and
yet
required
that
they
should
live
in
absolute
poverty
possessing
nothing
and
supporting
themselves
only
by
the
contributions
of
the
faithful
and
the
work
of
their
hands
clare
attempted
the
apparently
impossible
and
solved
the
problem
of
a
new
career
for
the
women
of
her
time
it
was
not
very
long
before
clare
example
proved
as
infective
as
that
of
francis
himself
while
in
the
beginning
the
members
of
her
family
had
been
the
most
strenuous
objectors
against
her
taking
up
such
an
unwonted
mode
of
existence
it
was
not
long
before
she
was
joined
in
the
monastery
of
damian
where
her
little
community
was
living
by
her
sister
who
was
to
become
almost
as
famous
as
herself
under
the
name
of
agnes
and
by
her
mother
and
other
near
relatives
from
assisi
and
the
neighborhood
this
second
order
of
francis
to
which
only
women
were
admitted
proved
to
have
in
it
the
germ
of
as
active
life
as
that
of
the
first
order
before
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
there
were
women
franciscans
in
every
country
in
europe
these
convents
furnished
for
women
a
refuge
from
the
worried
hurried
life
around
them
that
proved
quite
as
attractive
as
the
similar
opportunity
for
the
men
for
many
hundreds
of
years
down
even
to
our
own
time
women
were
to
find
in
the
quiet
obscurity
of
such
franciscan
convents
a
peaceful
happy
life
in
which
they
occupied
themselves
with
simple
conventual
duties
with
manual
labor
in
their
monastery
gardens
with
the
making
of
needle
work
in
which
they
became
the
most
expert
in
the
world
with
the
illuminating
of
missals
and
office
books
of
such
artistic
beauty
that
they
have
become
the
most
precious
treasures
of
our
great
libraries
and
with
the
long
hours
of
prayer
by
which
they
hoped
to
accomplish
as
much
in
making
the
world
better
as
if
they
devoted
themselves
to
ardent
efforts
of
reform
which
of
course
the
circumstances
of
the
time
would
not
have
permitted
finally
there
was
the
third
order
of
francis
which
was
to
gather
to
itself
so
many
of
the
distinguished
people
of
the
century
whose
occupations
and
obligations
would
not
permit
them
to
live
the
conventual
life
but
who
yet
felt
that
they
must
be
attached
by
some
bond
to
this
beautiful
sanctity
that
was
entering
into
all
the
better
life
of
the
century
the
third
order
was
established
so
as
to
permit
all
the
world
to
become
franciscans
to
whatever
degree
it
considered
possible
and
to
share
in
the
sublime
christianity
of
the
founder
whom
they
all
admired
so
much
even
if
they
were
not
able
to
imitate
his
sublimer
virtues
into
this
third
order
of
francis
most
of
the
finer
spirits
of
the
time
entered
with
enthusiasm
we
need
only
recall
that
louis
ix
of
france
the
greatest
monarch
of
the
century
considered
it
a
special
privilege
to
be
a
follower
of
the
humble
francis
and
that
elizabeth
of
hungary
the
daughter
of
a
king
the
wife
and
mother
of
a
ruling
prince
gave
another
example
of
the
of
francis
work
dante
was
another
of
the
great
members
of
the
third
order
and
was
buried
in
the
habit
of
francis
glorying
in
the
thought
of
the
brotherhood
this
gave
him
with
the
saint
he
loved
so
much
all
down
the
centuries
since
other
distinguished
men
in
many
countries
of
europe
were
proud
to
claim
the
same
distinction
modern
science
is
supposed
to
be
unorthodox
in
its
tendencies
and
electricity
is
the
most
recent
of
the
sciences
in
development
three
of
the
great
founders
in
electricity
volta
galvani
and
ampere
were
members
of
the
third
order
of
francis
and
at
least
one
of
them
galvani
insisted
on
being
buried
in
the
habit
of
the
order
six
centuries
after
the
death
of
his
father
francis
in
order
to
show
how
much
he
appreciated
the
privilege
there
is
no
man
who
lived
in
the
thirteenth
century
who
influenced
the
better
side
of
men
more
in
all
the
succeeding
ages
down
to
and
including
our
own
time
than
the
poor
little
man
of
god
of
assisi
he
is
just
coming
into
a
further
precious
heritage
of
uplift
for
the
men
of
our
time
that
is
surprising
for
those
who
are
so
buried
in
the
merely
material
that
they
fail
to
realize
how
much
the
ideal
still
rules
the
minds
of
thinking
men
but
that
seems
only
natural
and
inevitable
to
those
who
appreciate
all
the
attractiveness
there
is
in
a
simple
life
lived
without
the
bootless
hurry
the
unattaining
bustle
and
the
excitement
of
the
strenuous
existence
what
francis
and
his
order
accomplished
in
italy
another
great
saint
dominic
was
achieving
in
the
west
the
fact
that
another
order
similar
to
that
of
francis
in
many
respects
yet
differing
from
it
in
a
number
of
essential
particulars
should
have
arisen
almost
at
the
same
time
shows
how
profoundly
the
spirit
of
organization
of
effort
had
penetrated
into
the
minds
of
these
generations
of
the
thirteenth
century
while
poverty
was
to
be
the
badge
of
dominic
followers
as
well
as
those
of
francis
learning
was
to
replace
the
simplicity
which
francis
desired
for
his
sons
the
order
of
preachers
began
at
once
to
give
many
eminent
scholars
to
the
church
and
for
three
centuries
there
was
not
a
single
generation
that
did
not
see
as
dominicans
some
of
the
most
intellectual
men
of
europe
leaders
they
were
in
philosophy
in
the
development
of
thought
in
education
and
in
every
phase
of
ecclesiastical
life
the
watch
dogs
of
the
lord
domini
canes
they
were
called
punning
on
their
name
because
everwhere
they
were
in
the
van
of
defense
against
the
enemies
of
christianity
that
the
thirteenth
century
should
have
given
rise
to
two
such
great
religious
orders
stamps
it
as
a
wonderfully
fruitful
period
for
religion
as
well
as
for
every
other
phrase
of
human
development
in
order
to
understand
what
these
great
founders
tried
to
do
the
work
of
these
two
orders
must
be
considered
together
they
have
never
ceased
during
all
the
intervening
seven
centuries
to
be
the
source
of
great
influence
in
the
religious
world
they
have
proven
refuges
for
many
gentle
spirits
at
all
times
and
have
been
the
homes
of
learning
as
well
as
of
piety
while
occasionally
their
privileges
have
been
abused
and
men
have
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunities
to
be
idle
and
luxurious
this
has
happened
much
seldomer
than
the
world
imagines
not
a
single
century
has
failed
to
show
men
among
them
whom
the
world
honors
as
saints
and
whose
lives
have
been
examples
of
what
can
be
accomplished
by
human
nature
at
its
best
they
have
been
literally
schools
of
unselfishness
and
men
have
learned
to
think
less
of
themselves
and
more
of
their
labor
by
the
contemplation
of
the
lives
of
these
begging
friars
what
they
did
for
england
the
rev
augustus
jessopp
a
clergyman
in
england
has
recently
told
very
well
and
the
more
one
studies
their
history
the
higher
the
estimation
of
them
and
the
more
one
knows
of
them
the
less
does
one
talk
of
their
vices
green
in
his
history
of
the
english
people
has
paid
them
a
tribute
that
it
is
well
to
remember
to
bring
the
world
back
again
within
the
pale
of
the
church
was
the
aim
of
two
religious
orders
which
sprang
suddenly
to
life
at
the
opening
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
zeal
of
the
spaniard
dominic
was
aroused
at
the
sight
of
the
lordly
prelates
who
sought
by
fire
and
sword
to
win
the
albigensian
heretics
to
the
faith
he
cried
be
met
by
zeal
lowliness
by
lowliness
false
sanctity
by
real
sanctity
preaching
lies
by
preaching
truth
his
fiery
ardor
and
rigid
orthodoxy
were
seconded
by
the
mystical
piety
the
imaginative
enthusiasm
of
francis
of
assisi
the
life
of
francis
falls
like
a
stream
of
tender
light
across
the
darkness
of
the
time
in
the
frescoes
of
giotto
or
the
verse
of
dante
we
see
him
take
poverty
for
his
bride
he
strips
himself
of
all
he
flings
his
very
clothes
at
his
father
feet
that
he
may
be
one
with
nature
and
god
his
passionate
verse
claims
the
moon
for
his
sister
and
the
sun
for
his
brother
he
calls
on
his
brother
the
wind
and
his
sister
the
water
his
last
faint
cry
was
a
sister
death
strangely
as
the
two
men
differed
from
each
other
their
aim
was
the
same
to
convert
the
heathen
to
extirpate
heresy
to
reconcile
knowledge
with
orthodoxy
to
carry
the
gospel
to
the
poor
the
work
was
to
be
done
by
the
entire
reversal
of
the
older
monasticism
by
seeking
personal
salvation
in
effort
for
the
salvation
of
their
by
exchanging
the
solitary
of
the
cloister
for
the
preacher
the
monk
for
a
friar
to
force
the
new
into
entire
dependence
on
those
among
whom
they
labored
the
vow
of
poverty
was
turned
into
a
stern
reality
the
friars
were
to
subsist
on
the
alms
of
the
poor
they
might
possess
neither
money
nor
lands
the
very
houses
in
which
they
lived
were
to
be
held
in
trust
for
them
by
others
the
tide
of
popular
enthusiasm
which
welcomed
their
appearance
swept
before
it
the
reluctance
of
rome
the
jealousy
of
the
older
orders
the
opposition
of
the
parochial
priesthood
thousands
of
brethren
gathered
in
a
few
years
around
francis
and
dominic
and
the
begging
preachers
clad
in
their
coarse
frock
of
serge
with
the
girdle
of
rope
around
their
waist
wandered
barefooted
as
missionaries
over
asia
battled
with
heresy
in

in

universities

aquinas
the

no
one
of
all
the
sons
of
the
thirteenth
century
not
even
dante
himself
so
typifies
the
greatness
of
the
mentality
of
the
period
as
does
thomas
called
from
his
birthplace
aquinas
or
of
aquin
on
whom
his
own
and
immediately
succeeding
generations
because
of
what
they
considered
his
almost
more
than
human
intellectual
acumen
bestowed
the
title
of
angelical
doctor
while
the
church
for
the
supremely
unselfish
character
of
his
life
formally
conferred
the
title
of
saint
the
life
of
aquinas
is
of
special
interest
because
it
serves
to
clarify
many
questions
as
to
the
education
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
to
correct
many
false
impressions
that
are
only
too
prevalent
with
regard
to
the
intellectual
life
of
the
period
though
aquinas
came
of
a
noble
family
which
was
related
to
many
of
the
royal
houses
of
europe
and
was
the
son
of
the
count
of
aquino
then
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
noble
houses
of
italy
his
education
was
begun
in
his
early
years
and
was
continued
in
the
midst
of
such
opportunities
as
even
the
modern
student
might
well
envy
it
is
often
said
that
the
nobility
at
this
time
paid
very
little
attention
to
the
things
of
the
intellect
and
indeed
rather
prided
themselves
on
their
ignorance
of
even
such
ordinary
attainments
as
reading
and
writing
while
this
was
doubtless
true
for
not
a
few
of
them
aquinas
life
stands
in
open
contradiction
with
the
impression
that
any
such
state
of
mind
was
at
all
general
or
that
there
were
not
so
many
exceptions
as
to
nullify
any
such
supposed
rule
evidently
those
who
wished
could
and
did
take
advantage
of
educational
opportunities
quite
as
in
our
day
aquinas
early
education
was
received
at
the
famous
monastery
of
monte
cassino
in
southern
italy
where
the
benedictines
for
more
than
six
centuries
had
been
providing
magnificent
opportunities
for
the
studious
youth
of
italy
and
for
students
from
all
over
europe
when
he
was
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
he
proceeded
to
the
university
of
naples
which
at
that
time
under
the
patronage
of
the
emperor
frederick
was
being
encouraged
not
only
to
take
the
place
so
long
held
by
salernum
in
the
educational
world
of
europe
but
also
to
rival
the
renowned
universities
of
paris
and
bologna
here
he
remained
until
he
was
seventeen
years
of
age
when
he
resolved
to
enter
the
dominican
order
which
had
been
founded
only
a
short
time
before
by
dominic
yet
had
already
begun
to
make
itself
felt
throughout
the
religious
and
educational
world
of
the
time
just
as
it
is
the
custom
to
declare
that
as
a
rule
the
nobility
cared
little
for
education
so
it
is
more
or
less
usual
to
proclaim
that
practically
only
the
clergy
had
any
opportunities
for
the
higher
education
during
the
thirteenth
century
thomas
had
evidently
been
given
his
early
educational
opportunities
however
without
any
thought
of
the
possibility
of
his
becoming
a
clergyman
his
mother
was
very
much
opposed
to
his
entrance
among
the
dominicans
and
every
effort
was
made
to
picture
to
him
the
pleasures
and
advantages
that
would
accrue
to
him
because
of
his
noble
connections
in
a
life
in
the
world
thomas
insisted
however
and
his
firm
purpose
in
the
matter
finally
conquered
even
the
serious
obstacles
that
a
noble
family
can
place
in
the
way
of
a
boy
of
seventeen
as
regards
the
disposition
of
his
life
in
a
way
opposed
to
their
wishes
the
dominicans
realized
the
surpassing
intelligence
of
the
youth
whom
they
had
received
and
accordingly
he
was
sent
to
be
trained
under
the
greatest
teacher
of
their
order
the
famous
albert
the
great
who
was
then
lecturing
at
cologne
thomas
was
not
the
most
brilliant
of
scholars
as
a
young
man
and
seems
even
to
have
been
the
butt
of
his
more
successful
they
are
said
to
have
called
him
the
dumb
one
or
sometimes
because
of
his
bulkiness
even
as
a
youth
the
dumb
ox
albert
himself
however
was
not
deceived
in
his
estimation
of
the
intellectual
capacity
of
his
young
student
and
according
to
tradition
declared
that
the
bellowings
of
this
ox
would
yet
be
heard
throughout
all
christendom
after
a
few
years
spent
at
cologne
thomas
when
he
was
in
his
early
twenties
accompanied
albert
who
had
been
called
to
paris
it
was
at
paris
that
thomas
received
his
bachelor
degree
and
also
took
out
his
license
to
teach
the
degree
of
our
time
after
this
some
years
further
were
spent
at
cologne
and
then
the
greatness
of
the
man
began
to
dawn
on
his
generation
he
was
called
back
to
paris
and
became
one
of
the
most
popular
of
the
professors
at
that
great
university
in
the
height
of
her
fame
at
a
time
when
no
greater
group
of
men
has
perhaps
ever
been
gathered
together
than
shared
with
him
the
honors
of
the
chairs
at
that
institution
albert
the
great
roger
bacon
bonaventure
and
thomas
aquinas
form
among
themselves
so
to
speak
a
complete
representation
of
all
the
intellectual
powers
they
are
the
four
doctors
who
uphold
the
chair
of
philosophy
in
the
temple
of
the
middle
ages
their
mission
was
truly
the
reestablishment
of
the
sciences
but
not
their
final
consummation
they
were
not
exempt
from
the
ignorances
and
erroneous
opinions
of
their
day
yet
they
did
much
to
overcome
them
and
succeeded
better
than
is
usually
acknowledged
in
introducing
the
era
of
modern
thought
often
the
majesty
i
may
even
say
the
grace
of
their
conceptions
disappears
under
the
veil
of
the
expressions
in
which
they
are
clothed
but
these
imperfections
are
amply
atoned
for
by
superabundant
merits
those
christian
philosophers
did
not
admit
within
themselves
the
divorce
since
their
day
become
so
frequent
between
the
intellect
and
the
will
their
lives
were
uniformly
a
laborious
application
of
their
doctrines
they
realized
in
its
plenitude
the
practical
wisdom
so
often
dreamed
of
by
the
ancients
the
abstinence
of
the
disciples
of
pythagoras
the
constancy
of
the
stoics
together
with
humility
and
charity
virtues
unknown
to
the
antique
world
albert
the
great
and
thomas
left
the
castles
of
their
noble
ancestors
to
seek
obscurity
in
the
cloisters
of
dominic
the
former
abdicated
and
the
latter
declined
the
honors
of
the
church
it
was
with
the
cord
of
francis
that
roger
bacon
and
bonaventure
girded
their
loins
when
the
last
named
was
sought
that
the
roman
purple
might
be
placed
upon
his
shoulders
he
begged
the
envoys
to
wait
until
he
finished
washing
the
dishes
of
the
convent
thus
they
did
not
withdraw
themselves
within
the
exclusive
mysteries
of
an
esoteric
teaching
they
opened
the
doors
of
their
schools
to
the
sons
of
shepherds
and
artisans
and
like
their
master
christ
they
said
come
all
after
having
broken
the
bread
of
the
word
they
were
seen
distributing
the
bread
of
alms
the
poor
knew
them
and
blessed
their
names
even
yet
after
the
lapse
of
six
hundred
years
the
dwellers
in
paris
kneel
round
the
altar
of
the
angel
of
the
school
and
the
workmen
of
lyons
deem
it
an
honor
once
a
year
to
bear
upon
their
brawny
shoulders
the
triumphant
remains
of
the
doctor
for
most
modern
students
and
even
scholars
educated
in
secular
universities
the
name
of
aquinas
is
scarcely
more
than
a
type
the
greatest
of
them
it
is
true
of
the
schoolmen
who
were
so
much
occupied
with
distant
impractical
and
to
say
the
least
merely
theoretic
metaphysical
problems
in
the
later
middle
ages
it
is
true
that
the
renewed
interest
in
dante
in
recent
years
in
english
speaking
countries
has
brought
about
a
revival
of
attention
in
aquinas
work
because
to
dante
the
angelical
doctor
as
he
was
already
called
meant
so
much
and
because
the
divine
comedy
has
been
declared
often
and
often
by
competent
critics
to
be
the
summa
theologiae
of
thomas
of
aquin
in
verse
even
this
adventitious
literary
interest
however
has
not
served
to
lift
the
obscurity
in
which
aquinas
is
veiled
for
the
great
majority
of
scholarly
people
whose
education
has
been
conducted
according
to
modern
methods
and
ideas
as
showing
a
hopeful
tendency
to
recognize
the
greatness
of
these
thinkers
of
the
middle
ages
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
about
five
years
ago
one
of
thomas
great
works
the
summa
contra
gentiles
was
placed
on
the
list
of
subjects
which
a
candidate
may
at
his
option
offer
in
the
final
honor
school
of
the
at
oxford
there
has
come
a
definite
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
this
old
time
philosopher
represents
a
phase
of
intellectual
development
that
must
not
be
neglected
and
that
stands
for
such
educational
influence
as
may
well
be
taken
advantage
of
even
in
our
day
of
information
rather
than
mental
discipline
for
the
purposes
of
this
course
father
rickaby
has
prepared
an
annotated
translation
of
the
great
philosophic
work
under
the
title
of
god
and
his
creatures
which
was
published
by
burns
and
oates
of
london
this
will
enable
those
for
whom
the
latin
of
thomas
was
a
stumbling
block
to
read
the
thoughts
of
the
great
scholastic
in
translation
at
least
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
we
shall
hear
no
more
of
the
trifling
judgments
which
have
so
disgraced
our
english
philosophical
literature
the
fact
that
pope
leo
by
a
famous
papal
bull
insisted
that
thomas
should
be
the
standard
of
teaching
in
philosophy
and
theology
in
all
the
catholic
institutions
of
learning
throughout
the
world
aroused
many
thinkers
to
a
realization
of
the
fact
that
far
from
being
a
thing
of
the
dead
and
distant
past
thomas
voice
was
still
a
great
living
force
in
the
world
of
thought
to
most
people
leo
xiii
appealed
as
an
intensely
practical
and
thoroughly
modern
ruler
whose
judgment
could
be
depended
on
even
with
regard
to
teaching
problems
in
philosophy
and
theology
there
was
about
him
none
of
the
qualities
that
would
stamp
him
as
a
mystic
whose
thoughts
were
still
limited
by
medieval
barriers
the
fact
that
in
making
his
declaration
the
pope
was
only
formulating
as
a
rule
what
had
spontaneously
become
the
almost
constant
practice
and
tradition
of
catholic
schools
and
universities
of
itself
served
to
show
how
great
and
how
enduring
was
thomas
influence
in
the
drawing
together
of
christian
sects
that
has
inevitably
come
as
a
result
of
the
attacks
made
upon
christianity
by
modern
materialists
and
then
later
by
those
who
would
in
their
ardor
for
the
higher
criticism
do
away
with
practically
all
that
is
divine
in
christianity
there
has
come
a
very
general
realization
even
on
the
part
of
those
outside
of
her
fold
that
the
roman
catholic
church
occupies
a
position
more
solidly
founded
on
consistent
logical
premises
and
conclusions
than
any
of
the
denominations
without
her
aid
christian
apologetics
would
indeed
be
in
sad
case
pope
leo
declaration
only
emphasizes
the
fact
then
that
the
foundation
stone
of
christian
apologetics
was
laid
by
the
great
work
of
thomas
and
that
to
him
more
than
any
other
is
due
that
wonderful
coordination
of
secular
and
religious
knowledge
which
appoints
for
each
of
these
branches
of
knowledge
its
proper
place
and
satisfies
the
human
mind
better
than
any
other
system
of
philosophic
thought
this
is
the
real
panegyric
of
thomas
and
it
only
adds
to
the
sublimity
of
it
that
it
should
come
nearly
six
centuries
and
a
half
after
his
death
to
only
a
bare
handful
of
men
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
is
it
given
thus
to
influence
the
minds
of
subsequent
generations
for
so
long
and
to
have
laid
down
the
principles
of
thought
that
are
to
satisfy
men
for
so
many
generations
this
is
why
in
any
attempt
at
even
inadequate
treatment
of
the
greatness
of
the
thirteenth
century
thomas
aquinas
who
was
its
greatest
scholar
must
have
a
prominent
place
the
present
generation
has
had
sufficient
interest
in
him
aroused
however
amply
to
justify
such
a
giving
of
space
when
leo
xiii
made
his
recommendation
of
thomas
it
was
not
as
one
who
had
merely
heard
of
the
works
of
the
great
medieval
thinker
or
knew
them
only
by
tradition
or
had
slightly
dipped
into
them
as
a
dilettante
but
as
one
who
had
been
long
familiar
with
them
who
had
studied
the
angelical
doctor
in
youth
who
had
pondered
his
wisdom
in
middle
age
and
resorted
again
and
again
to
him
for
guidance
in
the
difficulties
of
doctrine
in
maturer
years
and
the
difficulties
of
morals
such
as
presented
themselves
in
his
practical
life
as
a
churchman
it
was
out
of
the
depths
of
his
knowledge
of
him
that
the
great
pope
whom
all
the
modern
world
came
to
honor
so
reverently
before
his
death
drew
his
supreme
admiration
for
thomas
and
his
recognition
of
the
fact
that
no
safer
guide
in
the
thorny
path
of
modern
christian
apologetics
could
be
followed
than
this
wonderful
genius
who
first
systematized
human
thought
as
far
as
the
relations
of
creator
to
creature
are
considered
in
the
heyday
of
medieval
scholarship
and
university
teaching
those
who
have
their
knowledge
of
scholastic
philosophy
at
second
hand
from
men
who
proclaim
this
period
of
human
development
as
occupied
entirely
with
fruitless
discussion
of
metaphysical
theories
will
surely
think
that
they
could
find
nothing
of
interest
for
them
in
thomas
writings
it
is
true
the
casual
reader
may
not
penetrate
far
enough
into
his
writing
to
realize
its
significance
and
to
appreciate
its
depth
of
knowledge
but
the
serious
student
finds
constant
details
of
supreme
interest
because
of
their
applications
to
the
most
problems
we
venture
to
quote
an
example
that
will
show
this
more
or
less
perfectly
according
to
the
special
philosophic
interest
of
readers
it
is
thomas
discussion
of
the
necessity
there
was
for
the
revelation
of
the
truth
of
the
existence
of
god
his
statement
of
the
reasons
why
men
occupied
with
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
would
not
ordinarily
come
to
this
truth
unless
it
were
revealed
to
them
though
they
actually
have
the
mental
capacity
to
reach
it
by
reason
alone
will
show
how
sympathetically
the
saint
appreciated
human
conditions
as
they
are
if
a
truth
of
this
nature
were
left
to
the
sole
inquiry
of
reason
three
disadvantages
would
follow
one
is
that
the
knowledge
of
god
would
be
confined
to
few
the
discovery
of
truth
is
the
fruit
of
studious
inquiry
from
this
very
many
are
hindered
some
are
hindered
by
a
constitutional
unfitness
their
natures
being
to
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
they
could
never
arrive
by
study
at
the
highest
grade
of
human
knowledge
which
consists
in
the
knowledge
of
god
others
are
hindered
by
the
claims
of
business
and
the
ties
of
the
management
of
property
there
must
be
in
human
society
some
men
devoted
to
temporal
affairs
these
could
not
possibly
spend
time
enough
in
the
learned
lessons
of
speculative
inquiry
to
arrive
at
the
highest
point
of
human
inquiry
the
knowledge
of
god
some
again
are
hindered
by
sloth
the
knowledge
of
the
truths
that
reason
can
investigate
concerning
god
presupposes
much
previous
knowledge
indeed
almost
the
entire
study
of
philosophy
is
directed
to
the
knowledge
of
god
hence
of
all
parts
of
philosophy
that
part
stands
over
to
be
learned
last
which
consists
of
metaphysics
dealing
with
divine
things
thus
only
with
great
labour
of
study
is
it
possible
to
arrive
at
the
searching
out
of
the
aforesaid
truth
and
this
labour
few
are
willing
to
undergo
for
sheer
love
of
knowledge
another
disadvantage
is
that
such
as
did
arrive
at
the
knowledge
or
discovery
of
the
aforesaid
truth
would
take
a
long
time
over
it
on
account
of
the
profundity
of
such
truth
and
the
many
prerequisites
to
the
study
and
also
because
in
youth
and
early
manhood
the
soul
tossed
to
and
fro
on
the
waves
of
passion
is
not
fit
for
the
study
of
such
high
truth
only
in
settled
age
does
the
soul
become
prudent
and
scientific
as
the
philosopher
says
thus
if
the
only
way
open
to
the
knowledge
of
god
were
the
way
of
reason
the
human
race
would
remain
in
thick
darkness
of
ignorance
as
the
knowledge
of
god
the
best
instrument
for
making
men
perfect
and
good
would
accrue
only
to
a
few
after
a
considerable
lapse
of
time
a
third
disadvantage
is
that
owing
to
the
infirmity
of
our
judgment
and
the
perturbing
force
of
imagination
there
is
some
admixture
of
error
in
most
of
the
investigations
of
human
reason
this
would
be
a
reason
to
many
for
continuing
to
doubt
even
of
the
most
accurate
demonstrations
not
perceiving
the
force
of
the
demonstration
and
seeing
the
divers
judgments
of
divers
persons
who
have
the
name
of
being
wise
men
besides
in
the
midst
of
much
demonstrated
truth
there
is
sometimes
an
element
of
error
not
demonstrated
but
asserted
on
the
strength
of
some
plausible
and
sophistic
reasoning
that
is
taken
for
a
demonstration
and
therefore
it
was
necessary
for
the
real
truth
concerning
divine
things
to
be
presented
to
men
with
fixed
certainty
by
way
of
faith
wholesome
therefore
is
the
arrangement
of
divine
clemency
whereby
things
even
that
reason
can
investigate
are
commanded
to
be
held
on
faith
so
that
all
might
be
easily
partakers
of
the
knowledge
of
god
and
that
without
doubt
and
error
book
i
cix
a
still
more
striking
example
of
thomas
eminently
sympathetic
discussion
of
a
most
difficult
problem
is
to
be
found
in
his
treatment
of
the
question
of
the
resurrection
of
the
body
the
doctrine
that
men
will
rise
again
on
the
last
day
with
the
same
bodies
that
they
had
while
here
on
earth
has
been
a
stumbling
block
for
the
faith
of
a
great
many
persons
from
the
beginning
of
christianity
in
recent
times
the
discovery
of
the
indestructibility
of
matter
far
from
lessening
the
skeptical
elements
in
this
problem
as
might
have
been
anticipated
has
rather
emphasized
them
while
the
material
of
which
man
body
was
composed
is
never
destroyed
it
is
broken
up
largely
into
its
original
elements
and
is
used
over
and
over
again
in
many
natural
processes
and
even
enters
into
the
composition
of
other
men
bodies
during
the
long
succeeding
generations
here
is
a
problem
upon
which
it
would
ordinarily
be
presumed
at
once
that
a
philosophic
writer
of
the
thirteenth
century
could
throw
no
possible
light
we
venture
to
say
however
that
the
following
passage
which
we
quote
from
an
article
on
thomas
in
a
recent
copy
of
the
dublin
represents
the
best
possible
solution
of
the
problem
even
in
the
face
of
all
our
modern
advance
in
science
what
does
not
bar
numerical
unity
in
a
man
while
he
lives
on
uninterruptedly
writes
thomas
clearly
can
be
no
bar
to
the
identity
of
the
arisen
man
with
the
man
that
was
in
a
man
body
while
he
lives
there
are
not
always
the
same
parts
in
respect
of
matter
but
only
in
respect
of
species
in
respect
of
matter
there
is
a
flux
and
reflux
of
parts
still
that
fact
does
not
bar
the
numerical
unity
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
life
the
form
and
species
of
the
several
parts
continue
throughout
life
but
the
matter
of
the
parts
is
dissolved
by
the
natural
heat
and
new
matter
accrues
through
nourishment
yet
the
man
is
not
numerically
different
by
the
difference
of
his
component
parts
at
different
ages
although
it
is
true
that
the
material
composition
of
the
man
at
one
stage
of
his
life
is
not
his
material
composition
at
another
addition
is
made
from
without
to
the
stature
of
a
boy
without
prejudice
to
his
identity
for
the
boy
and
the
adult
are
numerically
the
same
man
in
a
word
aquinas
says
that
we
recognize
that
the
body
of
the
boy
and
of
the
man
are
the
same
though
they
are
composed
of
quite
different
material
with
this
in
mind
the
problem
of
the
resurrection
takes
on
quite
a
new
aspect
from
what
it
held
before
what
we
would
call
attention
to
however
is
not
so
much
the
matter
of
the
argument
as
the
mode
of
it
it
is
essentially
modern
in
every
respect
not
only
does
thomas
know
that
the
body
changes
completely
during
the
course
of
years
but
he
knows
that
the
agent
by
which
the
matter
of
the
parts
is
dissolved
is
the
natural
heat
while
new
matter
accrues
through
nourishment
the
passage
contains
a
marvelous
anticipation
of
physiology
as
well
as
a
distinct
contribution
to
christian
apologetics
this
coordination
of
science
and
theology
though
usually
thought
to
be
lacking
among
scholastic
philosophers
is
constantly
typical
of
their
mode
of
thought
and
discussion
and
this
example
far
from
being
exceptional
is
genuinely
representative
of
them
as
all
serious
students
of
scholasticism
know
perhaps
the
last
thing
for
which
the
ordinary
person
would
expect
to
find
a
great
modern
teacher
recommending
the
reading
of
thomas
would
be
to
find
therein
the
proper
doctrine
with
regard
to
liberty
and
the
remedies
for
our
modern
social
evils
those
who
will
recall
however
how
well
the
generations
of
the
thirteenth
century
faced
social
problems
even
more
serious
than
ours
for
the
common
people
had
no
rights
at
all
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
yet
secured
them
with
such
satisfaction
as
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
modern
history
of
liberty
will
realize
that
the
intellectual
men
of
the
time
must
have
had
a
much
better
grasp
of
the
principles
underlying
such
problems
than
would
otherwise
be
imagined
as
a
matter
of
fact
treatment
of
society
its
rights
and
duties
and
the
mutual
relationship
between
it
and
the
individual
is
one
of
the
triumphs
of
his
wonderful
work
in
ethics
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
the
great
pope
of
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
whose
encyclicals
showed
that
he
understood
very
thoroughly
these
social
evils
of
our
time
recognized
their
tendencies
and
appreciated
their
danger
recommended
as
a
remedy
for
them
the
reading
of
thomas
pope
leo
said
domestic
and
civil
society
even
which
as
all
see
is
exposed
to
great
danger
from
the
plague
of
perverse
opinions
would
certainly
enjoy
a
far
more
peaceful
and
a
securer
existence
if
more
wholesome
doctrine
were
taught
in
the
academies
and
schools
one
more
in
conformity
with
the
teaching
of
the
church
such
as
is
contained
in
the
works
of
thomas
aquinas
for
the
teachings
of
thomas
on
the
true
meaning
of
liberty
which
at
this
time
is
running
into
license
on
the
divine
origin
of
all
authority
on
laws
and
their
force
on
the
paternal
and
just
rule
of
princes
on
obedience
to
the
higher
powers
on
mutual
charity
one
towards
another
on
all
of
these
and
kindred
subjects
have
very
great
and
invincible
force
to
overturn
those
principles
of
the
new
order
which
are
well
known
to
be
dangerous
to
the
peaceful
order
of
things
and
to
public
safety
for
this
great
pope
however
there
was
no
greater
teacher
of
any
of
the
serious
philosophical
ethical
and
theological
problems
than
this
saint
of
the
thirteenth
century
his
position
in
the
matter
would
only
seem
exaggerated
to
those
who
do
not
appreciate
pope
leo
marvelous
practical
intelligence
and
saint
thomas
exhaustive
treatment
of
most
of
the
questions
that
have
always
been
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
men
while
with
characteristic
humility
he
considered
himself
scarcely
more
than
a
commentator
on
aristotle
his
natural
genius
was
eminently
original
and
he
added
much
more
of
his
own
than
what
he
took
from
his
master
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
was
one
of
the
most
gifted
minds
in
all
humanity
history
and
that
for
profundity
of
intelligence
he
deserves
to
be
classed
with
plato
and
aristotle
as
his
great
disciple
dante
is
placed
between
homer
and
shakespeare
those
who
know
thomas
the
best
and
have
spent
their
lives
in
the
study
of
him
not
only
cordially
welcomed
but
ardently
applauded
pope
leo
commendation
of
him
and
considered
that
lofty
as
was
his
praise
there
was
not
a
word
they
would
have
changed
even
in
such
a
laudatory
passage
as
the
following
while
therefore
we
hold
that
every
word
of
wisdom
every
useful
thing
by
whomsoever
discovered
or
planned
ought
to
be
received
with
a
willing
and
grateful
mind
we
exhort
you
venerable
brethren
in
all
earnestness
to
restore
the
golden
wisdom
of
thomas
and
to
spread
it
far
and
wide
for
the
defense
and
beauty
of
the
catholic
faith
for
the
good
of
society
and
for
the
advantage
of
all
the
sciences
the
wisdom
of
thomas
we
say
for
if
anything
is
taken
up
with
too
great
subtlety
by
the
scholastic
doctors
or
too
carelessly
stated
if
there
is
anything
that
ill
agrees
with
the
discoveries
of
a
later
age
or
in
a
word
improbable
in
whatever
way
it
does
not
enter
our
mind
to
propose
that
for
imitation
to
our
age
let
carefully
selected
teachers
endeavor
to
implant
the
doctrines
of
thomas
aquinas
in
the
minds
of
students
and
set
forth
clearly
his
solidity
and
excellence
over
others
let
the
academies
already
founded
or
to
be
founded
by
you
illustrate
and
defend
this
doctrine
and
use
it
for
refutation
of
prevailing
errors
but
lest
the
false
for
the
true
or
the
corrupt
for
the
pure
be
drunk
in
be
watchful
that
the
doctrine
of
thomas
be
drawn
from
his
own
fountains
or
at
least
from
those
rivulets
which
derived
from
the
very
fount
have
thus
far
flowed
according
to
the
established
agreement
of
learned
men
pure
and
clear
be
careful
to
guard
the
minds
of
youth
from
those
which
are
said
to
flow
thence
but
in
reality
are
gathered
from
strange
and
unwholesome
streams
tributes
quite
as
laudatory
are
not
lacking
from
modern
secular
writers
and
while
there
have
been
many
derogatory
remarks
these
have
always
come
from
men
who
either
knew
aquinas
only
at
second
hand
or
who
confess
that
they
had
been
unable
to
read
him
understandingly
the
praise
all
comes
from
men
who
have
spent
years
in
the
study
of
his
writings
a
recent
writer
in
the
dublin
january
sums
up
his
appreciation
of
one
of
thomas
works
his
masterly
book
in
philosophy
as
follows
the
contra
is
an
historical
monument
of
the
first
importance
for
the
history
of
philosophy
in
the
variety
of
its
contents
it
is
a
perfect
encyclopedia
of
the
learning
of
the
day
by
it
we
can
fix
the
mark
of
thirteenth
century
thought
for
it
contains
the
lectures
of
a
doctor
second
to
none
in
the
great
school
of
thought
then
flourishing
the
university
of
paris
it
is
by
the
study
of
such
books
that
one
enters
into
the
mental
life
of
the
period
at
which
they
were
written
not
by
the
hasty
perusal
of
histories
of
philosophy
no
student
of
the
contra
gentiles
is
likely
to
acquiesce
in
the
statement
that
the
middle
ages
were
a
time
when
mankind
seemed
to
have
lost
the
power
of
thinking
for
themselves
medieval
people
thought
for
themselves
thoughts
curiously
different
from
ours
and
profitable
to
study
here
is
a
similar
high
tribute
for
aquinas
great
work
on
theology
from
his
modern
biographer
father
vaughan
the
theologica
is
a
mighty
synthesis
thrown
into
technical
and
scientific
form
of
the
catholic
traditions
of
east
and
west
of
the
infallible
dicta
of
the
sacred
page
and
of
the
most
enlightened
conclusions
of
human
reason
gathered
from
the
soaring
intuitions
of
the
academy
and
the
rigid
severity
of
the
lyceum
its
author
was
a
man
endowed
with
the
characteristic
notes
of
the
three
great
fathers
of
greek
philosophy
he
possessed
the
intellectual
honesty
and
precision
of
socrates
the
analytical
keenness
of
aristotle
and
that
yearning
after
wisdom
and
light
which
was
the
distinguishing
mark
of
the
divine
and
which
has
ever
been
one
of
the
essential
conditions
of
the
highest
intuitions
of
religion
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
the
very
greatness
of
thomas
aquinas
and
the
great
group
of
contemporaries
who
were
so
close
to
him
that
produced
an
unfortunate
effect
on
subsequent
thinking
and
teaching
in
europe
these
men
were
so
surpassing
in
their
grasp
of
the
whole
round
of
human
thought
that
their
works
came
to
be
worshiped
more
or
less
as
fetishes
and
men
did
not
think
for
themselves
but
appealed
to
them
as
authorities
it
is
a
great
but
an
unfortunate
tribute
to
the
scholastics
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
subsequent
generations
for
many
hundred
years
not
only
did
not
think
that
they
could
improve
on
them
but
even
hesitated
to
entertain
the
notion
that
they
could
equal
them
turner
in
his
history
of
philosophy
has
pointed
out
this
fact
clearly
and
has
attributed
to
it
to
a
great
extent
the
decadence
of
scholastic
philosophy
the
causes
of
the
decay
of
scholastic
philosophy
were
both
internal
and
external
the
internal
causes
are
to
be
found
in
the
condition
of
scholastic
philosophy
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
great
work
of
christian
syncretism
had
been
completed
by
the
masters
of
the
preceding
period
revelation
and
science
had
been
harmonized
contribution
had
been
levied
on
the
pagan
philosophies
of
greece
and
arabia
and
whatever
truth
these
philosophies
had
possessed
had
been
utilized
to
form
the
basis
of
a
rational
exposition
of
christian
revelation
the
efforts
of
roger
bacon
and
of
alfred
the
great
to
reform
scientific
method
had
failed
the
sciences
were
not
cultivated
there
was
therefore
no
source
of
development
and
nothing
was
left
for
the
later
scholastics
except
to
dispute
as
to
the
meaning
of
principles
to
comment
on
the
text
of
this
master
or
of
that
and
to
subtilize
to
such
an
extent
that
scholasticism
soon
became
a
synonym
for
captious
quibbling
the
great
thomistic
principle
that
in
philosophy
the
argument
from
authority
is
the
weakest
of
all
arguments
was
forgotten
aristotle
thomas
or
scotus
became
the
criterion
of
truth
and
as
solomon
whose
youthful
wisdom
had
astonished
the
world
profaned
his
old
age
by
the
worship
of
idols
the
philosophy
of
the
schools
in
the
days
of
its
decadence
turned
from
the
service
of
truth
to
prostrate
itself
before
the
shrine
of
a
master
dialectic
which
in
the
thirteenth
century
had
been
regarded
as
the
instrument
of
knowledge
now
became
an
object
of
study
for
the
sake
of
display
and
to
this
fault
of
method
was
added
a
fault
of
style
an
uncouthness
and
barbarity
of
terminology
which
bewilder
the
modern
reader
the
appreciation
of
thomas
in
his
own
time
is
the
greatest
tribute
to
the
critical
faculty
of
the
century
that
could
be
made
genius
is
praised
but
starves
in
the
words
of
the
old
roman
poet
certainly
most
of
the
geniuses
of
the
world
have
met
with
anything
but
their
proper
meed
of
appreciation
in
their
own
time
this
is
not
true
however
during
our
thirteenth
century
we
have
already
shown
how
the
artists
and
especially
giotto
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
giotto
was
only
years
old
were
appreciated
and
how
much
attention
dante
began
to
attract
from
his
contemporaries
and
we
may
add
that
all
the
great
scholars
of
the
period
had
a
following
that
insured
the
wide
publication
of
their
works
at
a
time
when
this
had
to
be
accomplished
by
slow
and
patient
the
appreciation
for
thomas
indeed
came
near
proving
inimical
to
his
completion
of
his
important
works
in
philosophy
and
theology
many
places
in
europe
wanted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
hear
him
we
have
only
reintroduced
the
practise
of
exchanging
university
professors
in
very
recent
years
this
was
quite
a
common
practise
in
the
thirteenth
century
however
and
so
thomas
after
having
been
professor
at
paris
and
later
at
rome
taught
for
a
while
at
naples
and
then
at
a
number
of
the
italian
universities
everywhere
he
went
he
was
noted
for
the
kindliness
of
his
disposition
and
for
his
power
to
make
friends
looked
upon
as
the
greatest
thinker
of
his
time
it
would
be
easy
to
expect
that
there
should
be
some
signs
of
consciousness
of
this
and
as
a
consequence
some
of
that
unpleasant
which
so
often
makes
great
intellectual
geniuses
unpopular
thomas
however
never
seems
to
have
had
any
of
his
own
talents
but
realizing
how
little
he
knew
compared
to
the
whole
round
of
knowledge
and
how
superficial
his
thinking
was
compared
to
the
depth
of
the
mysteries
he
was
trying
not
to
solve
but
to
treat
satisfactorily
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
was
no
question
of
conceit
having
a
place
in
his
life
this
must
account
for
the
universal
friendship
of
all
who
came
in
contact
with
him
the
popes
insisted
on
having
him
as
a
professor
at
the
roman
university
in
which
they
were
so
much
interested
and
which
they
wished
to
make
one
of
the
greatest
universities
of
the
time
here
thomas
was
brought
in
contact
with
ecclesiastics
from
all
over
the
world
and
helped
to
form
the
mind
of
the
time
those
who
think
the
popes
of
the
middle
ages
opposed
to
education
should
study
the
records
of
this
roman
university
thomas
became
the
great
friend
of
successive
popes
some
of
whom
had
been
brought
in
contact
with
him
during
his
years
of
studying
and
teaching
at
rome
and
paris
this
gave
him
many
privileges
and
abundant
encouragement
but
finally
came
near
ruining
his
career
as
a
philosophic
writer
and
teacher
since
his
papal
friends
wished
to
raise
him
to
high
ecclesiastical
dignities
urban
iv
seems
first
to
have
thought
of
this
but
his
successor
clement
one
of
the
noblest
churchmen
of
the
period
who
had
himself
wished
to
decline
the
papacy
actually
made
out
the
bull
creating
thomas
archbishop
of
naples
when
this
document
was
in
due
course
presented
to
aquinas
far
from
giving
him
any
pleasure
it
proved
a
source
of
grief
and
pain
he
saw
the
chance
to
do
his
slipping
from
him
this
was
so
evident
to
his
friend
the
pope
that
he
withdrew
the
bull
and
thomas
was
left
in
peace
during
the
rest
of
his
career
and
allowed
to
prosecute
that
one
great
object
to
which
he
had
dedicated
his
mighty
intellect
this
was
the
summing
up
of
all
human
knowledge
in
a
work
that
would
show
the
relation
of
the
creator
to
the
creature
and
apply
the
great
principles
of
greek
philosophy
to
the
sublime
truths
of
christianity
had
thomas
consented
to
accept
the
archbishopric
of
naples
in
all
human
probability
as
thomas
great
english
biographer
remarks
the
summa
theologica
would
never
have
been
written
it
seems
not
unlikely
that
the
dignity
was
pressed
upon
him
by
the
pope
partly
at
the
solicitation
of
powerful
members
of
his
family
who
hoped
in
this
to
have
some
compensation
for
their
relative
having
abandoned
his
opportunities
for
military
and
worldly
glory
it
is
fortunate
that
their
efforts
failed
and
it
is
only
one
of
the
many
examples
in
history
of
the
there
may
be
in
considerations
that
seem
founded
on
the
highest
human
prudence
thomas
was
left
free
then
to
go
on
with
his
great
work
and
during
the
next
five
years
he
applied
every
spare
moment
to
the
completion
of
his
summa
more
students
have
pronounced
this
the
greatest
work
ever
written
than
is
true
for
any
other
that
has
ever
been
used
in
schools
that
it
should
be
the
basis
of
modern
theological
teaching
after
seven
centuries
is
of
itself
quite
sufficient
to
proclaim
its
merit
the
men
who
are
most
enthusiastic
about
it
are
those
who
have
used
it
the
longest
and
who
know
it
the
best
thomas
english
biographer
the
very
rev
roger
bede
vaughan
who
is
a
worthy
member
of
that
distinguished
vaughan
family
who
have
given
so
many
zealous
ecclesiastics
to
the
english
church
and
so
many
scholars
to
support
the
cause
of
christianity
can
scarcely
say
enough
of
this
great
work
nor
of
its
place
in
the
realm
of
theology
when
it
is
recalled
that
father
vaughan
was
not
a
member
of
thomas
own
order
the
dominicans
but
of
the
benedictines
it
will
be
seen
that
it
was
not
because
of
any
de
but
out
of
the
depths
of
his
great
admiration
for
the
saint
that
his
words
of
praise
were
written
it
has
been
shown
abundantly
that
no
writer
before
the
day
could
have
created
a
synthesis
of
all
knowledge
the
greatest
of
the
classic
fathers
have
been
treated
of
and
the
reasons
of
their
inability
are
evident
as
for
the
scholastics
who
more
immediately
preceded
the
angelical
their
minds
were
not
ripe
for
so
great
and
complete
a
work
the
fullness
of
time
had
not
yet
come
very
possibly
had
not
albert
the
great
and
alexander
of
hales
preceded
him
thomas
would
not
have
been
prepared
to
write
his
just
as
most
probably
newton
would
never
have
discovered
the
law
of
gravitation
had
it
not
been
for
the
previous
labors
of
galileo
and
of
kepler
but
just
as
the
english
astronomer
stands
solitary
in
his
greatness
though
surrounded
and
succeeded
by
men
of
extraordinary
eminence
so
also
the
angelical
stands
by
himself
alone
although
albertus
magnus
was
a
genius
alexander
was
a
theological
king
and
bonaventure
a
seraphic
doctor
just
as
the
principia
is
a
work
unique
unreachable
so
too
is
the
theologica
of
the
great
angelical
just
as
dante
stands
alone
among
the
poets
so
stands
thomas
in
the
schools
probably
the
most
marvelous
thing
about
the
life
of
thomas
is
his
capacity
for
work
his
written
books
fill
up
some
twenty
folios
in
their
most
complete
edition
this
of
itself
would
seem
to
be
enough
to
occupy
a
lifetime
without
anything
more
his
written
works
however
represent
apparently
only
the
products
of
his
hours
at
leisure
he
was
only
a
little
more
than
fifty
when
he
died
and
he
had
been
a
university
professor
at
cologne
at
bologna
at
paris
at
rome
and
at
naples
in
spite
of
the
amount
of
work
that
he
was
thus
asked
to
do
his
order
the
dominican
constantly
called
on
him
to
busy
himself
with
certain
of
its
internal
affairs
on
one
occasion
at
least
he
visited
england
in
order
to
attend
a
dominican
chapter
at
oxford
and
the
better
part
of
several
years
at
paris
was
occupied
with
his
labors
to
secure
for
his
brethren
a
proper
place
in
the
university
so
that
they
might
act
as
teachers
and
yet
have
suitable
opportunities
for
the
education
and
the
discipline
of
the
members
of
the
order
verily
it
would
seem
as
though
his
days
must
have
been
at
least
twice
as
long
as
those
of
the
ordinary
scholar
and
student
to
accomplish
so
much
yet
he
is
only
a
type
of
the
monks
of
the
middle
ages
of
whom
so
many
people
seem
to
think
that
their
principal
traits
were
to
be
fat
and
lazy
thomas
was
fat
as
we
know
from
the
picture
of
him
which
shows
him
before
a
desk
from
which
a
special
segment
has
been
removed
to
accommodate
more
conveniently
a
rather
abnormal
abdominal
development
but
as
to
laziness
surely
the
last
thing
that
would
occur
to
anyone
who
knows
anything
about
him
would
be
to
accuse
him
of
it
clearly
those
who
accept
the
ancient
notion
of
monkish
laziness
will
never
understand
the
middle
ages
the
great
educational
progress
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
due
almost
entirely
to
monks
there
is
another
extremely
interesting
side
to
the
intellectual
character
of
thomas
aquinas
which
is
usually
not
realized
by
the
ordinary
student
of
philosophy
and
theology
and
still
less
perhaps
by
those
who
are
interested
in
him
from
an
educational
standpoint
this
is
his
poetical
faculty
for
thomas
as
for
many
of
the
great
intellectual
geniuses
of
the
modern
time
the
sacrament
of
the
holy
eucharist
was
one
of
the
most
wondrously
satisfying
devotional
mysteries
of
christianity
and
the
subject
of
special
devotion
in
our
own
time
the
great
cardinal
newman
manifested
this
same
attitude
of
mind
thomas
because
of
his
devotion
to
the
blessed
sacrament
was
asked
by
the
pope
to
write
the
office
for
the
then
recently
established
feast
of
corpus
christi
there
are
always
certain
hymns
incorporated
in
the
offices
of
the
different
feast
days
it
might
ordinarily
have
been
expected
that
a
scholar
like
aquinas
would
write
the
prose
portions
of
the
office
leaving
the
hymns
for
some
other
hand
or
selecting
hymns
from
some
older
sacred
poetry
thomas
however
wrote
both
hymns
and
prose
and
surprising
as
it
may
be
his
hymns
are
some
of
the
most
beautiful
that
have
ever
been
composed
and
remain
the
admiration
of
posterity
it
must
not
be
forgotten
in
this
regard
that
thomas
career
occurred
during
the
period
when
latin
hymn
writing
was
at
its
apogee
the
dies
irae
and
the
stabat
mater
were
both
written
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
the
most
precious
latin
hymns
of
all
times
were
composed
during
the
century
and
a
half
from
to
aquinas
hymns
do
not
fail
to
challenge
comparison
even
with
the
greatest
of
these
while
he
had
an
eminently
devotional
subject
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
certain
supremely
difficult
theological
problems
were
involved
in
the
expression
of
devotion
to
the
blessed
sacrament
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
thomas
succeeded
in
making
not
only
good
theology
but
great
poetry
a
portion
of
one
of
his
hymns
the
tantum
ergo
has
been
perhaps
more
used
in
church
services
than
any
other
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
dies
irae
another
one
of
his
beautiful
hymns
that
especially
deserves
to
be
admired
is
less
well
known
and
so
i
have
ventured
to
quote
three
selected
stanzas
of
it
as
an
illustration
of
thomas

over
rhyme

rhythm

tongue

louis
the
monarch
if
large
numbers
of
men
are
to
be
ruled
by
one
of
their
number
as
seems
more
or
less
inevitable
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
then
without
doubt
the
best
model
of
what
such
a
monarch
life
should
be
is
to
be
found
in
that
of
louis
who
for
nearly
half
a
century
was
the
ruler
of
france
during
our
period
of
all
the
rulers
of
men
of
whom
we
have
record
in
history
he
probably
took
his
duties
most
seriously
with
most
regard
for
others
and
least
for
himself
and
for
his
family
there
is
not
a
single
relation
of
life
in
which
he
is
not
distinguished
and
in
which
his
career
is
not
worth
studying
as
an
example
of
what
can
be
done
by
a
simple
earnest
man
to
make
life
better
and
happier
for
all
those
who
come
in
contact
with
him
his
relations
with
his
mother
are
those
of
an
affectionate
son
in
whom
indeed
from
his
easy
compliance
with
her
wishes
in
his
younger
years
one
might
suspect
some
weakness
but
whose
strength
of
character
is
displayed
at
every
turn
once
he
himself
assumed
the
reins
of
government
after
many
years
of
ruling
however
when
his
departure
on
the
crusade
compelled
him
to
be
absent
from
the
kingdom
it
was
to
her
he
turned
again
to
act
as
his
representative
and
the
wisdom
of
the
choice
no
one
can
question
as
a
husband
louis
life
was
a
model
and
though
he
could
not
accomplish
the
impossible
and
was
not
able
to
keep
the
relations
of
his
mother
and
his
wife
as
cordial
as
he
would
have
liked
them
to
be
judging
from
human
experience
generally
it
is
hard
to
think
this
constitutes
any
serious
blot
on
his
fair
name
as
a
father
few
men
have
ever
thought
less
of
material
advantages
for
their
children
or
more
of
the
necessity
for
having
them
realize
that
happiness
in
life
does
not
consist
in
the
possession
of
many
things
but
rather
in
the
accomplishment
of
duty
and
in
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
giving
of
happiness
to
others
constitutes
the
best
source
of
felicity
for
one
self
his
letters
and
instructions
to
his
children
as
preserved
for
us
by
joinville
and
other
contemporaries
give
us
perhaps
the
most
taking
picture
of
the
man
that
we
have
and
round
out
a
personality
which
while
it
has
in
the
telling
french
phrase
the
defects
of
its
virtues
is
surely
one
of
the
most
beautiful
characters
that
has
ever
been
seen
upon
earth
in
a
man
who
took
an
active
and
extremely
important
part
in
the
great
events
of
the
world
of
his
time
the
salient
points
of
his
character
are
his
devotion
to
the
three
great
needs
of
humanity
as
they
present
themselves
in
his
time
he
made
it
the
aim
of
his
life
that
men
should
have
justice
and
education
and
when
for
any
misfortune
they
needed
it
charity
and
every
portion
of
his
career
is
taken
up
with
successful
achievement
in
these
great
departments
of
social
action
it
is
well
known
that
when
he
became
conscious
that
the
judges
sometimes
abused
their
power
and
gave
sentences
for
partial
reasons
the
monarch
himself
took
up
the
onerous
duty
of
hearing
appeals
and
succeeded
in
making
the
judges
of
his
kingdom
realize
that
only
the
strictest
justice
would
save
them
from
the
king
displeasure
and
condign
punishment
for
an
unjust
judge
there
was
short
shrift
the
old
tree
at
versailles
under
which
he
used
to
hear
the
causes
of
the
poor
who
appealed
to
him
stood
for
many
centuries
as
a
reminder
of
louis
precious
effort
to
make
the
dispensing
of
justice
equal
to
all
men
when
the
duty
of
hearing
appeals
took
up
too
much
of
his
time
it
was
transferred
to
worthy
shoulders
and
so
the
important
phase
of
jurisprudence
in
france
relating
to
appeals
came
to
be
thoroughly
established
as
a
part
of
the
organic
law
of
the

as
regards

too
much
can
not
be
said
of

influence
it
is
to
him
more
than
to
anybody
else
that
the
university
of
paris
owes
the
success
it
achieved
as
a
great
institution
of
learning
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
had
the
monarch
been
opposed
to
the
spread
of
education
with
any
idea
that
it
might
possibly
undermine
his
authority
had
he
even
been
indifferent
to
it
paris
would
not
have
come
to
be
the
educational
center
of
the
world
as
it
was
louis
not
only
encouraged
it
in
every
way
but
also
acted
as
the
patron
of
great
subsidiary
institutions
which
were
to
add
to
its
prestige
and
enhance
its
facilities
among
the
most
noteworthy
is
the
sorbonne
la
sainte
chapelle
deserves
to
be
mentioned
however
and
the
library
attached
to
it
which
owed
its
foundation
and
development
to
louis
were
important
factors
in
attracting
students
to
paris
and
in
furnishing
them
interestingly
suggestive
material
for
thought
and
the
development
of
taste
during
their
residence
there
his
patronage
of
vincent
of
beauvais
the
encyclopedist
was
but
a
further
manifestation
of
his
interest
in
everything
educational
his
benefactions
to
the
hotel
dieu
must
be
considered
rather
under
the
head
of
charity
and
yet
they
also
serve
to
represent

voltaire

whom
louis
character
as
a
supreme
believer
in

must
have
been
so
utterly
unsympathetic

whose
position
as
the
historical
symbol
of
all
that
voltaire
most
held
in
antipathy

might
have
been
expected

into

things

his
piety
which
was
that
of
an

did
not
deprive
him
of
any
kingly
virtue
a
wise
economy
took
nothing
from
his
liberality
a
profound
policy
was
combined
with
strict
justice
and
he
is
perhaps
the
only
sovereign
who
is
entitled
to
this
praise
prudent
and
firm
in
counsel

without
rashness
in

from
their
catholic
aspects
has
much
of
good
to
say
of
louis

there
is
not
wanting
rather
definite
evidence
of
the
reluctance
of
his
admiration

powerful
influence

events
subsequent
to

own
times

it
has
never
seen
such
a
king
as
this
louis
never
seen
a
man
possessing
sovereign
power

yet
not
contracting

vices
and
passions
which
attend
it
displaying
upon

throne
in
such
a

degree
every
human
virtue
purified

louis

or
personal
impulse
to
his
age
he
did
not
strongly
influence
the
nature
or
the
development
of
civilization
in
france
whilst
he
endeavored
to
reform
the
gravest
abuses
of
the
feudal
system
by
the
introduction
of
justice
and

order
he
did
not
endeavor
to

it
either
by

substitution
of
a
pure
monarchy
or
by
setting

against
class
in
order
to

above

he
was
neither
an
egotist
nor

was
in
all
sincerity
in
harmony
with
his
age
and
sympathetic
alike
with
the
faith
the
institutions
the
customs
and
the
tastes
of
france
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
yet
both
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
in
later
times
louis
stands
apart
as
a
man
of
profoundly
original
character
an
isolated
figure
without
any
peer
among
his
contemporaries
or
his
successors
as
far
as
it
was
possible
in

he

man

goes
even
further
than

louis
did
honor
to
france
to
royalty
to
humanity
and
to
christianity
this
was
the
feeling
of
his
contemporaries
and
after
six
centuries
it
is
still
confirmed
by
the
judgment
of
the
historian
of
louis
wonderful
influence
for
good
as
a
ruler
all
historians
are
agreed
in
talking
in
the
highest
terms
his
private
life
however
is
even
more
admirable
for
our
purpose
of
bringing
out
the
greatness
of
the
thirteenth
century
of
course
many
legends
and
myths
have
gathered
around
his
name
but
still
enough
remains
of
absolutely
trustworthy
tradition
and
even
documentary
evidence
to
make
it
very
clear
that
he
was
a
man
among
men
a
nobleman
of
nature
making
who
in
any
position
of
life
would
have
acquitted
himself
with
a
perfection
sure
to
make
his
life
worthy
of
admiration
one
of
the
most
striking
traits
of
his
character
is
his
love
of
justice
his
insatiable
desire
to
render
to
all
men
what
was
rightly
theirs
a
biographer
has
told
the
story
that
gives
the
most
telling
proof
of
this
in
relating
the
solicitude
with
which
he
tried
to
right
all
the
wrongs
not
only
of
his
own
reign
but
of
those
of
his
predecessors
before
he
set
out
on
the
crusade
he
wished
to
have
the
absolute
satisfaction
that
he
nor
his
owed
any
man
any
reparation
as
the
most
precious
treasure
he
could
take
with
him
on
his
perilous
expedition
he
wished
even
to
undo
any
wrongs
that
might
have
been
done
in
his
name
though
he
was
entirely
unconscious
of
them
as
he
wished
to
be
in
a
state
of
grace
at
the
moment
of
departure
and
to
take
with
him
to
the
holy
land
a
quiet
conscience
by
leaving
the
kingdom
in
as
happy
a
condition
as
possible
he
resolved
to
carry
out
one
of
the
noblest
measures
ever
undertaken
by
a
king
by
his
order
inquisitors
were
sent
into
all
the
provinces
annexed
to
the
royal
dominion
since
the
accession
of
philip
augustus
all
those
who
had
been
maltreated
or
despoiled
by
the
bailiffs
seneschals
provosts
sergeants
and
other
representatives
of
the
royal
authority
came
to
declare
their
wrongs
to
these
newly
appointed
judges
and
to
demand
the
reparation
which
was
due
to
them
the
number
was
great
since
for
forty
years
there
had
been
much
suffering
in
the
country
districts
and
even
in
the
towns
the
royal
officers
had
too
often
acted
as
if
they
were
in
a
conquered
country
they
believed
themselves
to
be
safe
from
observation
so
that
they
might
do
as
they
pleased
the
people
had
much
to
endure
during
these
forty
years
and
it
was
a
noble
idea
to
make
reparation
freely
and
with
elaborate
care
no
prince
had
been
known
of
his
own
accord
and
at
his
own
cost
to
redress
the
wrongs
inflicted
on
the
people
during
the
reigns
of
his
father
and
grandfather
this
made
an
immense
impression
which
lasted
for
centuries
blanche
son
was
not
merely
a
good
king
he
became
the
unrivalled
sovereign
the
impeccable
judge
the
friend
and
consoler
of
his
subjects
it
is
no
wonder
that
so
inappeasable
a
lover
of
justice
should
commend
that
virtue
above
all
others
to
his
son
when
we
read
his
letters
to
that
son
who
was
to
be
his
successor
in
the
light
of
louis
own
career
we
appreciate
with
what
utter
sincerity
they
were
written
louis
realized

that

just

in

you
if

goes

who

support
the

rather
than
the

and
when
the

do
that
which
is
just
and
if
it
happen
that
any
man
has
a
dispute
with
yourself
maintain
the
cause
of
your
adversary
before
the
council
so
as
not
to
appear
partial
to
your
own
cause
until
the
truth
is
known
unless
you
do
this
those
who
are
of
the
council
may
fear
to
speak
against
you
and
this
ought
not
to
be
and
if
you
find
that
you
possess
anything
unjustly
acquired
either
in
your
time
or
in
that
of
your
predecessors
make
restitution
at
once
however
great
its

either
in

if
the

as

deliver
your

position
and
engrossed
the
attention
of
the
king
as
entirely
and
were
subjects
of
as
keen
an
interest
as
if
he
had
been
a
father
with
no
other
task
than
the
care
of
his
children
after
supper
they
followed
him
to
his
apartment
where
he
made
them
sit
around
him
for
a
time
whilst
he
instructed
them
in
their
duty
he
then
sent
them
to
bed
he
would
direct
their
attention
particularly
to
the
good
and
bad
actions
of
princes
he
used
to
visit
them
in
their
own
apartment
when
he
had
any
leisure
inquire
as
to
their
progress
and
like
a
second
tobias
give
them
excellent
instruction
on
maundy
thursday
he
and
his
children
used
to
wash
the
feet
of
a
dozen
poor
persons
give
them
large
alms
and
afterward
wait
upon
them
whilst
they
dined
the
king
together
with
his
king
thibault
whom
he
loved
and
looked
upon
as
his
own
son
carried
the
first
poor
man
to
the
hospital
of
compiègne
and
his
two
oldest
sons
louis
and
philippe
carried
the
second
they
were
accustomed
to
act
with
him
in
all
things
showing
him
great
reverence
and
he
desired
that
they
and
thibault
should
also
obey
him
implicitly
in
everything
that
he
commanded
anyone
who
still
retains
any
trace
of
the
notion
which
used
to
be
unfortunately
a
commonplace
among
english
speaking
people
that
the
medieval
monks
were
unworthy
of
their
great
calling
and
that
the
monasteries
were
the
homes
of
lazy
men
whose
only
object
in
taking
up
the
life
was
to
secure
an
easy
means
of
livelihood
will
be
thoroughly
undeceived
if
he
but
read
with
some
attention
the
stories
of
louis
relations
to
the
monasteries
in
all
his
journeys
he
stopped
in
them
he
always
asked
to
see
their
libraries
he
insisted
on
not
being
treated
better
than
the
community
and
in
every
way
he
tried
to
show
his
esteem
for
them
there
is
a
story
which
may
or
may
not
be
true
in
the
little
flowers
of
francis
which
comes
from
almost
a
contemporary
source
however
that
once
on
his
travels
he
called
on
brother
giles
the
famous
companion
of
francis
of
whom
so
many
delightfully
humorous
stories
are
told
brother
giles
received
his
affectionate
greeting
but
said
never
a
word
in
return
after
the
first
words
the
king
himself
said
nothing
but
both
sat
and
communed
in
silence
for
some
time
and
then
the
king
departed
apparently
with
his
visit
needless
to
say
when
brother
giles
told
the
story
of
the
king
of
france
having
called
on
him
there
was
a
commotion
in
the
community
but
by
this
time
the
king
was
far
distant
on
his
way
indeed
louis
took
so
many
opportunities
to
stop
in
monasteries
and
follow
monastic
regulations
as
to
prayer
and
the
taking
of
meals
while
there
that
he
quite
disgusted
some
of
the
members
of
his
retinue
who
were
most
with
him
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
in
her
impatience
at
him
for
this
is
once
said
to
have
remarked
under
such
indiscreet
circumstances
that
it
was
reported
to
louis
that
she
wished
they
had
a
man
and
not
a
monk
for
king
louis
is
said
to
have
asked
her
very
gently
if
she
would
prefer
that
he
spend
most
of
his
time
in
sport
and
in
excesses
of
various
kinds
even
such
remarks
however
had
no
effect
in
turning
him
from
his
purpose
to
live
as
simply
and
as
beneficently
for
others
as
possible
his
genuine
appreciation
of
the
monks
must
be
recognized
from
his
wishes
with
regard
to
his
children
on
the
other
hand
his
readiness
to
secure
their
happiness
as
far
as
possible
in
the
way
they
wished
for
themselves
shows
the
tenderness
of
his
fatherly
heart
a
modern
biographer
has
said
of
him
he
was
very
anxious
that
his
three
children
born
in
the
east
during
the
crusade
jean
tristan
pierre
and
blanche
and
even
his
eldest
daughter
isabella
should
enter
the
monastic
life
which
he
looked
upon
as
the
most
likely
to
insure
their
salvation
he
frequently
exhorted
them
to
take
this
step
writing
letters
of
the
greatest
tenderness
and
piety
especially
to
his
daughter
isabella
but
as
they
did
not
show
any
taste
for
it
he
did
not
attempt
to
force
their
inclinations
thenceforth
he
busied
himself
in
making
suitable
marriages
for
them
and
establishing
them
according
to
their
rank
at
the
same
time
he
gave
them
the
most
judicious
advice
as
to
their
conduct
and
actions
in
the
world
upon
which
they
were
entering
when
he
was
before
tunis
and
found
that
he
was
sick
unto
death
he
gave
the
instructions
which
he
had
written
out
in
french
with
his
own
hand
to
his
eldest
son
philip
they
are
models
of
virtue
wisdom
and
paternal
tenderness
worthy
of
a
king
and
a
christian
perhaps
the
most
interesting
feature
of
louis
life
was
his
treatment
of
the
poor
he
used
literally
to
recall
the
fact
that
they
must
stand
to
him
in
the
place
of
god
whatever
you
do
to
the
least
of
these
you
do
even
unto
me
was
a
favorite
expression
frequently
in
his
mouth
he
waited
on
them
personally
and
no
matter
how
revolting
their
appearance
would
not
be
deterred
from
this
personal
service
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
his
courtiers
did
not
sympathize
with
this
state
of
mind
though
louis
used
to
encourage
them
not
only
by
his
example
but
by
personal
persuasion
every
holy
thursday
he
used
to
wash
the
feet
of
twelve
poor
people
at
a
public
ceremonial
in
honor
of
the
washing
of
the
feet
of
the
apostles
by
christ
illustration
apostle
la
sainte
chapelle
paris
it
must
not
be
thought
moreover
that
such
a
proceeding
was
perhaps
less
repugnant
to
the
feelings
of
the
men
of
that
time
than
they
are
to
the
present
generation
it
might
be
considered
that
the
general
paucity
of
means
for
maintaining
personal
cleanliness
in
medieval
times
would
make
the
procedure
less
disgusting
as
a
proof
of
the
contrary
of
this
we
have
the
words
of
joinville
who
tells
of
the
following
conversation
many
a
time
says
joinville
i
have
seen
him
cut
their
bread
for
them
and
pour
out
their
drink
one
day
he
asked
me
if
i
washed
the
feet
of
the
poor
on
maundy
thursday
sire
i
answered
what
the
feet
of
those
dirty
wretches
no
indeed
i
shall
never
wash
them
truly
replied
the
king
you
have
spoken
ill
for
you
ought
not
to
despise
that
which
god
intended
for
your
instruction
i
pray
you
therefore
first
of
all
for
the
love
of
god
and
then
by
your
love
towards
me
that
you
make
a
habit
of
washing
their
feet
even
more
striking
than
this
however
was
his
attitude
toward
the
lepers
of
the
time
these
poor
creatures
were
compelled
to
live
apart
from
the
population
and
were
not
allowed
to
approach
healthy
individuals
they
were
of
exceeding
interest
to
louis
however
who
took
every
opportunity
to
mitigate
the
trials
and
hardships
of
their
existence
whenever
he
met
them
on
his
journeys
he
insisted
on
abundant
alms
being
given
them
and
gave
orders
that
every
possible
provision
for
their
welfare
consonant
with
the
care
that
their
affection
should
not
be
permitted
to
spread
be
made
for
them
over
and
over
again
he
greeted
them
as
his
brothers
and
when
his
retinue
feared
to
approach
them
would
himself
go
to
them
in
order
to
console
them
by
his
words
and
his
exhibition
of
personal
interest
there
is
an
incident
told
of
his
having
on
one
occasion
when
a
muddy
stream
intervened
between
him
and
some
lepers
forded
the
stream
alone
in
order
to
get
to
them
and
neither
any
personal
fear
of
contagion
nor
any
natural
repugnance
was
permitted
to
deter
him
from
this
sublime
work
of
charity
it
is
no
wonder
that
his
people
proclaimed
him
a
saint
that
is
one
who
thinks
first
of
others
and
only
second
of
himself
even
during
his
lifetime
the
only
supposed
blot
upon
louis
character
is
the
denunciation
by
certain
modern
writers
of
what
they
call
the
fanaticism
which
prompted
him
to
go
on
the
crusades
instead
of
remaining
at
home
properly
to
care
for
his
people
the
opinion
with
regard
to
the
place
that
must
be
assigned
to
the
crusades
as
a
factor
in
history
and
national
as
well
as
european
development
has
changed
very
much
in
recent
years
formerly
it
was
the
custom
almost
entirely
to
condemn
them
and
to
look
upon
them
as
a
serious
mistake
such
ideas
however
are
only
entertained
by
those
who
do
not
realize
the
conditions
under
which
they
were
undertaken
or
the
important
results
which
flowed
from
them
bishop
stubbs
in
his
lectures

medieval
and
modern
history
delivered
while
he
was
professor
of
history
at
oxford
has
been
at
some
pains
to
correct
this
false
notion
and
his
passage
constitutes
one
of
the
best
apologies
for
louis
interest
in
the
crusades
which
could
be
written
he
said
the
crusades
are
not
in
my
mind
either
the
popular
delusions
that
our
cheap
literature
has
determined
them
to
be
nor
papal
conspiracies
against
kings
and
peoples
as
they
appear
to
protestant
controversialists
nor
the
savage
outbreak
of
expiring
barbarism
thirsting
for
blood
and
plunder
nor
volcanic
explosions
of
religious
intolerance
i
believe
them
to
have
been
in
their
deep
sources
and
in
the
minds
of
their
best
champions
and
in
the
main
tendency
of
their
results
capable
of
ample
justification
they
were
the
first
great
effort
of
medieval
life
to
go
beyond
the
pursuit
of
selfish
and
isolated
ambitions
they
were
the
of
the
young
world
essaying
to
use
to
the
glory
of
god
and
the
benefit
of
man
the
arms
of
its
new
knighthood
that
they
failed
in
their
direct
object
is
only
what
may
be
alleged
against
almost
every
great
design
which
the
great
disposer
of
events
has
moulded
to
help
the
world
progress
for
the
world
has
grown
wise
from
the
experience
of
failure
rather
than
by
the
winning
of
high
aims
that
the
good
they
did
was
largely
leavened
with
evil
may
be
said
of
every
war
that
has
ever
been
waged
that
bad
men
rose
by
them
while
good
men
fell
is
and
must
be
true
wherever
and
whenever
the
race
is
to
the
swift
and
the
battle
to
the
strong
but
that
in
the
end
they
were
a
benefit
to
the
world
no
one
who
reads
can
doubt
and
that
in
their
course
they
brought
out
a
love
for
all
that
is
heroic
in
human
nature
the
love
of
freedom
the
honor
of
prowess
sympathy
with
sorrow
perseverance
to
the
last
the
chronicles
of
the
age
abundantly
prove

moreover
that
it
was
by

no

readily
appreciate
that

only
the
fitting
culmination
of
a
great
literary
era
after
having
gone
over
even
as
hurriedly
as
has
been
necessary
in
our
brief
space
what
was
accomplished
in

country

in

was

live
not

because
of
the
greatness

also
for
the
ultimateness
of
its
expression

should
expect
some
surpassing
literary
genius
at

seems
almost
inevitable
indeed
that
a

poet
whose
name
stands
above
all
others
but
one
or
two
at
the
most
in
the
whole
history
of

should
have
lived
in

should
have
summed
up
effectually
in
himself
all
the

men

he
considered
the
five
greatest
poets
of
all
time
it
seems
sublimest
egotism
at
first
thought
many
will
at
once
conclude
that
his
reason
for
so
doing
was
that
in
the
unlettered
times
his
critical
faculty
was
not
well
developed
and
as
he
knew
that
his
work
far
surpassed
that
of
his
contemporaries
he
could
scarcely
help
but
conclude
that
his
place
must
be
among
the
great
poets
any
such
thought
however
is
entirely
due
to
lack
of
knowledge
of
the

of
dante
life
and

he
had
been

he
appreciated
them
highly
it
was
the
consciousness
of
genius
that
made
him
place
himself
so
high
and
not
any
faulty
comparison
with
others
succeeding
generations
have
set
him
even
higher
than
the
place
chosen
by
himself
and
now
we
breathe
his
name
only
with
those
of
homer
and
shakespeare
considering
that
these
three
sublime
immortals
are
so
far
above
all
other
poets
that
there
is
scarcely
a
second
to
them
dante
is
the
most
universal
of
poets
he
has
won
recognition
from
all
nations
and
he
has
been
the
favorite
reading
of
the
most
diverse
times
and
conditions
of
men
from
the
very
beginning
he
has
been
appreciated
and
even
before
his
death
men
had
begun
to
realize
something
of
the
supremacy
of
his
greatness
commentaries
on
his
works
that
have
been
preserved
down
to
our
own
day
were
written
almost
during
his
lifetime
only
supreme
interest
could
have
tempted
men
to
multiply
these
by
the
hard
labor
of
patient
handwriting
petrarch
who
as
a
young
man
was
his
contemporary
recognized
him
as
the
prince
of
italian
poets
who
had
composed
in
their
common
tongue
and
even
was
tempted
to
say
that
the
subtle
and
profound
conceptions
of
the
commedia
could
not
have
been
written
without
the
special
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
boccaccio
was
wont
to
speak
of
him
as
the
divine
poet
and
tells
us
that
he
had
learned
that
petrarch
deliberately
held
aloof
from
the
commedia
through
fear
of
losing
his
originality
if
he
came
under
the
spell
of
so
great
a
master
very
few
realize
how
great
a
poet
dante
must
be
considered
even
if
only
the
effusions
of
his
younger
years
were
to
be
taken
as
the
standard
of
his
poetical
ability
some
of
his
sonnets
are
as
beautiful
of
their
kind
as
are
to
be
found
in
this
form
of
poetry
his
description
of
his
is
famous
among
sonnets
of
lovers
and
may
only
be
compared
with
some
of
the
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
in
our
own
day
or
with
one
or
two
of
camoens
original
sonnets
in
the
portuguese
for
lofty
praise
of
the
beloved
in
worthy
numbers
after
reading
dante
sonnets
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
a
half
century
later
petrarch
was
able
to
raise
the
sonnet
form
to
an
excellence
that
was
never
to
be
surpassed
with
a
beginning
like
this
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
sonnet
became
so
popular
in
europe
during
the
next
three
centuries
and
that
every
young
poet
down
to
time
had
an
attack
of
sonneteering
just
as
he
might
have
had
an
attack
of
the
measles
the
first
one
of
a
pair
of
sonnets
that
are
considered
supreme
in
their
class
deserves
a
place
here
as
an
example
of
dante
poetic
faculty
in
this
form
for
which
he
is
so
much
less
known
than
he
ought
to
be
he
sees
completely
fullest
bliss
abound
who
among
ladies
sees
my
lady
face
those
that
with
her
do
go
are
surely
bound
to
give
god
thanks
for
such
exceeding
grace
and
in
her
beauty
such
strange
might
is
found
that
envy
finds
in
other
hearts
no
place
so
she
makes
them
walk
with
her
clothed
all
round
with
love
and
faith
and
courteous
gentleness
the
sight
of
her
makes
all
things
lowly
be
nor
of
herself
alone
she
gives
delight
but
each
through
her
receiveth
honor
due
and
in
her
acts
is
such
great
courtesy
that
none
can
recollect
that
wondrous
sight
who
sighs
not
for
it
in
love
sweetness
true
it
will
be
noted
that
dante
has
nothing
to
say
of
the
personal
appearance
of
his
beloved
this
is
true
however
of
the
whole
series
of
poems
to
and
about
her
he
never
seems
to
have
thought
for
a
moment
of
her
physical
qualities
what
he
finds
worthy
to
praise
is
her
goodness
which
shines
out
from
her
features
so
that
everyone
rejoices
in
it
while
a
sweetness
fills
the
heart
as
if
a
heavenly
visitor
had
come
for
him
her
supreme
quality
is
that
with
all
her
beauty
envy
finds
no
place
in
others
hearts
because
she
is
so
clothed
around
with
love
and
faith
and
courteous
gentleness
it
has
often
been
said
that
shakespeare
did
not
describe
the
physical
appearances
of
his
heroines
because
he
realized
that
this
meant
very
little
but
then
shakespeare
had
to
write
for
the
stage
and
realized
that
blondes
and
brunettes
especially
in
the
olden
time
could
not
be
made
to
order
and
that
it
was
better
to
leave
the
heroine
physical
appearance
rather
vague
it
would
be
expected
however
that
dante
with
his
southern
temperament
would
have
dwelt
on
the
physical
perfections
of
his
fair
the
next
sonnet
however
of
the
best
known
group
emphasizes
his
abstraction
of
all
physical
influence
in
the
matter
and
insists
on
her
goodness
and
the
womanly
beauty
of
her
character
it
will
be
found
in
our
chapter
on
women
of
the
century
in
his
earlier
years
dante
considered
himself
one
of
the
troubadours
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
he
had
never
written
the
divine
comedy
he
still
would
have
been
remembered
as
one
of
the
great
poets
who
wrote
of
love
in
this
thirteenth
century
not
only
does
he
deserve
a
place
among
the
greatest
of
the
minnesingers
the
trouvères
and
the
troubadours
but
he
is
perhaps
the
greatest
of
them
that
he
should
have
sung
as
he
did
at
the
end
of
the
century
only
shows
that
he
was
in
the
stream
of
literary
evolution
and
not
being
merely
carried
idly
along
but
helping
to
guide
it
into
ever
fairer
channels
minor
poems
would
have
made
enduring
fame
for
any
poet
of
less
genius
than
himself
his
prose
works
deserve
to
be
read
by
anyone
who
wishes
to
know
the
character
of
this
greatest
of
poets
and
also
to
appreciate
what
the
educational
environment
of
the
thirteenth
century
succeeded
in
making
out
of
good
intellectual
material
when
presented
to
it
dante
works
are
the
real
treasury
of
information
of
the
most
precious
kind
with
regard
to
the
century
since
they
provide
the
proper
standpoint
from
which
to
view
all
that
it
accomplished
while
dante
was
a
supreme
singer
among
the
poets
of
a
great
song
time
it
was
only
natural
in
the
light
of
what
we
know
about
the
literary
product
of
the
rest
of
this
century
that
he
should
have
put
into
epic
form
the
supreme
product
of
his
genius
with
the
great
national
epics
in
every
country
of
europe
the
cid
the
arthur
legends
and
the
nibelungen
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
and
the
epical
poems
of
the
meistersingers
during
its
first
half
it
is
not
surprising
but
on
the
contrary
rather
what
might
have
been
confidently
looked
for
that
there
should
have
arisen
a
great
national
epic
in
italy
before
the
end
of
the
century
the
gothic
art
movement
spread
through
all
these
countries
and
so
did
the
wind
of
the
spirit
of
esthetic
accomplishment
which
blew
the
flame
of
national
literature
in
each
country
into
a
mighty
blaze
that
not
only
was
never
to
be
extinguished
but
was
to
be
a
beacon
light
in
the
realm
of
national
literatures
forever
after
we
have
already
said
a
word
of
the
contemporary
admiration
for
the
poet
but
it
should
be
realized
that
due
appreciation
of
dante
continued
in
italy
during
all
the
time
when
italian
art
and
literature
was
at
its
highest
it
dwindled
only
at
periods
of
decadence
and
lack
of
taste
cornelius
law
with
regard
to
dante
influence
on
art
is
very
well
known
italian
art
according
to
him
has
been
strong
and
vigorous
just
in
proportion
as
it
has
worked
under
dante
influence
while
it
became
weak
and
sensuous
as
that
influence
declined
this
has
held
true
from
the
very
beginning
and
has
been
as
true
for
literature
as
for
art
when
the
italians
became
interested
in
trivialities
and
gave
themselves
up
to
weak
imitations
of
the
classics
or
to
pastoral
poetry
that
was
not
a
real
expression
of
feeling
but
a
passing
fancy
of
literary
folk
then
dante
was
for
a
time
in
obscurity
even
at
the
height
of
the
renaissance
however
when
greek
was
at
the
acme
of
its
interest
and
the
classics
occupied
so
much
attention
that
dante
might
be
expected
to
be
eclipsed
the
great
thinkers
and
critics
of
the
time
still
worshipped
at
the
shrine
of
their
great
master
of
italian
verse
the
best
proof
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
michael
angelo
famous
sonnets
in
praise
of
dante
the
second
of
which
would
seem
to
exhaust
all
that
can
be
said
in
praise
of
a
brother
poet
into
the
dark
abyss
he
made
his
way
both
nether
worlds
he
saw
and
in
the
might
of
his
great
soul
beheld
god
splendour
bright
and
gave
to
us
on
earth
true
light
of
day
star
of
supremest
worth
with
its
clear
ray
heaven
secrets
he
revealed
to
us
through
our
dim
sight
and
had
for
guerdon
what
the
base
world
spite
oft
gives
to
souls
that
noblest
grace
display
full
ill
was
dante
understood
his
purpose
high
by
that
ungrateful
state
that
welcomed
all
with
kindness
but
the
good
would
i
were
such
to
bear
like
evil
fate
to
taste
his
exile
share
his
lofty
mood
for
this
i
gladly
give
all
earth
calls
great
in
the
first
of
this
pair
of
sonnets
however
michael
angelo
gave
if
possible
even
higher
praise
than
this
it
will
be
recalled
that
he
himself
besides
being
the
greatest
of
sculptors
and
one
of
the
greatest
of
painters
and
architects
in
a
wonderfully
productive
period
was
also
a
very
great
poet
these
sonnets
to
dante
the
one
to
his
crucifix
and
one
to
vittoria
colonna
are
the
best
proof
of
this
he
knew
how
to
chisel
thoughts
into
wonderfully
suitable
words
quite
as
well
as
marble
into
the
beautiful
forms
that
grew
under
his
hands
with
all
his
greatness
and
he
must
have
been
conscious
of
it
he
thinks
that
he
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
give
up
all
that
earth
calls
great
simply
to
share
dante
lofty
mood
even
in
his
exile
no
greater
tribute
has
ever
been
paid
by
one
poet
to
another
than
this
and
michael
angelo
genius
was
above
all
critical
never
thoughtlessly
laudatory
as
emphasizing
the
highest
enlightened
taste
of
a
great
epoch
this
has
seemed
to
deserve
a
place
here
also
what
should
be
said
of
him
speech
may
not
tell
his
splendor
is
too
great
for
men
dim
sight
and
easier
to
blame
his
foes
aright
than
for
his
poorest
gifts
to
praise
him
well
he
tracked
the
path
that
leads
to
depths
of
hell
to
teach
us
wisdom
scaled
the
eternal
height
and
heaven
with
open
gates
did
him
invite
who
in
his
own
loved
city
might
not
dwell
ungrateful
country
of
his
fate
to
her
own
loss
full
proof
we
have
in
this
that
souls
most
perfect
bear
the
greatest
woe
of
thousand
things
suffice
in
this
to
state
no
exile
ever
was
unjust
as
his
nor
did
the
world
his
equal
ever
know
in
england
in
spite
of
distance
of
country
race
and
language
the
appreciation
of
dante
began
very
early
readers
of
chaucer
know
the
great
italian
as
the
favorite
poet
of
the
father
of
english
poetry
and
over
and
over
again
he
has
expressed
the
feeling
of
how
much
greater
than
anything
he
could
hope
to
do
was
dante
accomplishment
readers
will
remember
how
chaucer
feels
unable
to
tell
the
story
of
ugolino
and
his
starving
sons
in
the
hunger
tower
and
refers
those
interested
in
the
conclusion
of
the
tale
to
dante
after
the
religious
revolt
of
the
early
sixteenth
century
dante
was
lost
sight
of
to
a
great
extent
his
temper
was
too
catholic
to
be
appreciated
by
puritan
england
and
the
elizabethans
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
own
creation
of
a
great
national
literature
to
have
any
time
for
appreciation
of
a
foreigner
so
different
in
spirit
from
their
times
with
the
coming
of
the
oxford
movement
however
dante
at
once
sprang
into
favor
and
a
number
of
important
critical
appreciations
of
him
reintroduced
him
to
a
wide
reading
public
in
england
most
of
whom
were
among
the
most
cultured
of
the
island
this
renewed
interest
in
dante
gave
rise
to
some
of
the
best
critical
appreciations
in
any
language
dean

famous
essay
is
the
classic
english
monograph
on
dante
and
its
opening
paragraph
sounds
the
keynote
of
critical
opinion
among
english
speaking
people
the
divina
commedia
is
one
of
the
landmarks
of
history
more
than
a
magnificent
poem
more
than
the
beginning
of
a
language
and
the
opening
of
a
national
literature
more
than
the
inspirer
of
art
and
the
glory
of
a
great
people
it
is
one
of
those
rare
and
solemn
monuments
of
the
mind
power
which
measure
and
test
what
it
can
reach
to
which
rise
up
ineffaceably
and
forever
as
time
goes
on
marking
out
its
advance

grander

no
better
introduction
to
dante
could
be
obtained
than
this
from
dean
church
those
who
have
found
it
difficult
to
get
interested
in
the
great
florentine
poet
and
who
have
been
prone
to
think
that
perhaps
the
pretended
liking
for
him
on
the
part
of
many
people
was
an
affectation
rather
than
a
sincere
expression
of
opinion
should
read
this
essay
and
learn
something
of
the
wealth
of
sympathy
there
is
in
dante
for
even
the
man
of
these
modern
times
our
thirteenth
century
poet
is
not
easy
to
read
but
there
is
probably
no
reading
in
all
the
world
that
brings
with
it
so
much
of
intellectual
satisfaction
so
much
of
awakening
of
the
best
feelings
in
man
so
many
glimpses
into
the
depths
of
his
being
as
some
lines
from
dante
pondered
under
favorable
circumstances
like
one
of
these
gothic
cathedrals
of
the
olden
times
he
never
grows
old
but
on
the
contrary
every
favorite
passage
seems
to
have
a
new
message
for
each
mood
of
the
reader
this
is
particularly
true
for
the
spiritual
side
of
man
being
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
dean
church
in
a
passage
toward
the
end
of
his
essay
those
who
know
the
divina
commedia
best
will
best
know
how
hard
it
is
to
be
the
interpreter
of
such
a
mind
but
they
will
sympathize
with
the
wish
to
call
attention
to
it
they
know
and
would
wish
others
also
to
know
not
by
hearsay
but
by
experience
the
power
of
that
wonderful
poem
they
know
its
austere
yet
submitting
beauty
they
know
what
force
there
is
in
its
free
and
earnest
and
solemn
verse
to
strengthen
to
tranquillize
to
console
it
is
a
small
thing
that
it
has
the
secret
of
nature
and
man
that
a
few
keen
words
have
opened
their
eyes
to
new
sights
in
earth
and
sea
and
sky
have
taught
them
new
mysteries
of
sound
have
made
them
recognize
in
distinct
image
of
thought
fugitive
feelings
or
their
unheeded
expression
by
look
or
gesture
or
motion
that
it
has
enriched
the
public
and
collective
memory
of
society
with
new
instances
never
to
be
lost
of
human
feeling
and
fortune
has
charmed
mind
and
ear
by
the
music
of
its
stately
march
and
the
variety
and
completeness
of
its
plan
but
besides
this
they
know
how
often
its
seriousness
has
put
to
shame
their
trifling
its
magnanimity
their
its
living
energy
their
indolence
its
stern
and
sad
grandeur
rebuked
low
thoughts
its
thrilling
tenderness
overcome
sullenness
and
assuaged
distress
its
strong
faith
quelled
despair
and
soothed
perplexity
its
vast
grasp
imparted
the
sense
of
harmony
to
the
view
of
clashing
truth
they
know
how
often
they
have
found
in
times
of
trouble
if
not
light
at
least
that
deep
sense
of
reality
permanent
though
unseen
which
is
more
than

can
always
give
in
the
view
which
it
has
suggested
to
them
of
the
judgments
and
love
of
god
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
fact
of
dante
english
popularity
paralleling
the
oxford
movement
both
the
great
english
cardinals
who
were
such
prominent
agents
in
that
movement
looked
upon
him
as
a
favorite
author
both
of
them
have
given
him
precious
tributes
newman
lofty
compliment
was
the
flattery
of
imitation
when
he
wrote
the
dream
of
gerontius
that
poem
for
poets
which
has
told
the
men
of
our
generation
more
about
the
immediate
hereafter
than
anything
written
in
these
latter
centuries
no
poet
of
the
intervening
period
or
of
any
other
time
has
so
satisfactorily
presented
the
after
world
as
these
writers
so
distant
in
time
so
different
in
environment
the
one
an
italian
of
the
thirteenth
the
other
an
englishman
of
the
nineteenth
century
cardinal
manning
tribute
was
much
more
formal
though
not
less
glorious
it
occurs
in
the
introduction
to
father
bowden
english
edition
of
the
german
critic
hettinger
appreciation
of
dante
and
deserves
a
place
here
because
it
shows
how
much
a
representative
modern
churchman
thinks
of
the
great
florentine
poet
there
are
three
works
which
always
seem
to
me
to
form
a
triad
of
dogma
of
poetry
and
of
devotion
the
summa
of
thomas
the
divina
commedia
and
the
paradisus
animae
a
manual
of
devotional
exercises
by
horstius
all
three
contain
the
same
outline
of
faith
thomas
traces
it
on
the
intellect
dante
upon
the
imagination
and
the
paradisus
animae
upon
the
heart
the
poem
unites
the
book
of
dogma
and
the
book
of
devotion
clothed
in
conceptions
of
intensity
and
of
beauty
which
have
never
been
surpassed
nor
equalled
no
uninspired
hand
has
ever
written
thoughts
so
high
in
words
so
resplendent
as
the
last
stanza
of
the
divina
commedia
it
was
said
of
thomas
summan
thomae
nihil
restat
nisi
lumen
after
the
summa
of
thomas
nothing
is
left
except
the
light
of
glory
it
may
be
said
of
dante
dantis
paradisum
nihil
restat
nisi
visio
after
dante
paradise
nothing
is
left
except
the
vision
of
god
of
course
john
ruskin
had
a
admiration
for
so
great
a
spiritual
thinker
as
dante
and
expressed
it
in
no
uncertain
terms
with
his
wonderful
power
to
point
out
the
significance
of
unexpected
manifestations
of
human
genius
ruskin
has
even
succeeded
in
minimizing
one
of
the
great
objections
urged
against
dante
better
perhaps
than
could
be
done
by
anyone
else
for
english
speaking
people
at
least
for
many
readers
dante
is
almost
unbearable
because
of
certain
grotesque
elements
they
find
in
him
this
has
been
the
source
and
cause
of
more
unfavorable
criticism
than
anything
else
in
the
great
florentine
writings
ruskin
of
course
saw
it
but
appreciated
it
at
its
proper
significance
and
has
made
clear
in
a
passage
that
every
dante
reader
needs
to
go
over
occasionally
in
order
to
assure
himself
that
certain
unusual
things
in
dante
attitude
towards
life
are
an
expression
rather
of
the
highest
human
genius
and
its
outlook
on
life
than
some
narrow
limitation
of
medievalism
ruskin
said
i
believe
that
there
is
no
test
of
greatness
in
nations
periods
nor
men
more
sure
than
the
development
among
them
or
in
them
of
a
noble
grotesque
and
no
test
of
comparative
smallness
or
limitation
of
one
kind
or
another
more
sure
than
the
absence
of
grotesque
invention
or
incapability
of
understanding
it
i
think
that
the
central
man
of
all
the
world
as
representing
in
perfect
balance
the
imaginative
moral
and
intellectual
faculties
all
at
their
highest
is
dante
and
in
him
the
grotesque
reaches
at
once
the
most
distinct
and
the
most
noble
development
to
which
it
was
ever
brought
in
the
human
mind
of
the
grotesqueness
in
our
own
shakespeare
i
need
hardly
speak
nor
of
its
intolerableness
to
his
french
critics
nor
of
that
of
aeschylus
and
homer
as
opposed
to
the
lower
greek
writers
and
so
i
believe
it
will
be
found
at
all
periods
in
all
minds
of
the
first
order
great
reverence
for
dante
might
have
been
expected
in
italy
but
the
colder
northern
nations
shared
it
in
germany
modern
admiration
for
dante
began
with
that
great
wave
of
critical
appreciation
which
entered
into
german
literature
with
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
might
almost
have
been
expected
frederick
schlegel
was
one
of
the
first
modern
german
admirers
of
dante
though
his
brother
august
whose
translations
of
shakespeare
began
that
series
of
german
studies
of
shakespeare
which
has
been
so
fruitful
during
the
past
century
was
also
an
open
admirer
of
the
medieval
poet
since
then
there
has
practically
been
no
time
when
germany
has
not
had
some
distinguished
dante
scholar
and
when
it
has
not
been
supplying
the
world
with
the
products
of
profound
study
and
deep
scholarship
with
regard
to
him
the
modern
educational
world
has
come
to
look
so
confidently
toward
germany
for
the
note
of
its
critical
appreciation
that
the
dante
devotion
of
the
germans
will
be
the
best
possible
encouragement
for
those
who
need
to
have
the
feeling
that
their
own
liking
is
shared
by
good
authorities
before
they
are
quite
satisfied
with
their
appreciation
dean
plumptre
has
summed
up
the
dante
movement
in
germany
in
a
compendious
paragraph
that
must
find
a
place
here
in
the
year
scartazzini
the
great
dante
scholar
of
the
nineteenth
century
recognizes
a
new
starting
point
the
period
of
neglect
of
supercilious
criticism
comes
to
an
end
and
one
of
reverence
admiration
and
exhaustive
study
begins
his
account
of
the
labors
of
german
scholars
during
the
sixty
years
that
have
followed
fills
a
large
part
of
his
volume
translations
of
the
commedia
by
kopisch
kannegiesser
witte
philalethes
the
nom
de
plume
of
john
king
of
saxony
josefa
von
hoffinger
of
the
minor
poems
by
witte
and
krafft
endless
volumes
and
articles
on
all
points
connected
with
dante
life
and
character
the
publications
of
the
deutsche
from
to
present
a
body
of
literature
which
has
scarcely
a
parallel
in
history
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
germans
have
taught
italians
to
understand
and
appreciate
their
own
poet
just
as
they
have
at
least
helped
to
teach
englishmen
to
understand
shakespeare
nor
must
it
be
thought
that
only
the
literary
lights
of
germany
thoroughly
appreciated
the
great
florentine
the
greater
the
genius
of
the
man
the
more
his
admiration
for
dante
if
he
but
once
becomes
interested
in
him
a
noteworthy
example
of
this
is
alexander
von
humboldt
the
distinguished
german
scientist
who
was
generally
looked
upon
as
perhaps
the
greatest
thinker
in
european
science
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
is
said
to
have
been
very
faithful
in
his
study
of
dante
and
has
expressed
his
admiration
in
no
uncertain
terms
curiously
enough
he
found
much
to
admire
him
for
in
matters
scientific
for
while
it
is
not
generally
realized
dante
was
an
acute
observer
of
nature
and
has
given
expression
in
his
works
to
many
observations
with
regard
to
subjects
that
would
now
be
considered
within
the
scope
of
natural
science
in
a
way
to
anticipate
many
supposedly
modern
bits
of
information
with
regard
to
this
humboldt
said
in
his
cosmos
when
the
glory
of
the
aramaic
greek
and
roman
dominion
or
i
might
almost
say
when
the
ancient
world
had
passed
away
we
find
in
the
great
and
inspired
founder
of
a
new
era
dante
alighieri
occasional
manifestations
of
the
deepest
sensibility
to
the
charms
of
the
terrestrial
life
of
nature
whenever
he
abstracts
himself
from
the
passionate
and
subjective
control
of
that
despondent
mysticism
which
constituted
the
general
circle
of
his
ideas
how
little
humboldt
seems
to
have
realized
in
his
own
absorption
in
external
nature
that
the
qualities
he
blames
in
dante
are
of
the
very
essence
of
his
genius
rounding
out
his
humanity
to
an
interest
in
all
relations
supernatural
as
well
as
natural
and
that
without
them
he
would
not
be
the
world
poet
for
all
time
that
he
is
in
america
dante
came
to
his
own
almost
as
soon
as
literature
obtained
her
proper
place
in
our
new
country
the
first
generation
of
distinctly
literary
men
comprise
the
group
at
cambridge
including
longfellow
emerson
oliver
wendell
holmes
charles
eliot
norton
james
russell
lowell
and
others
of
minor
importance
it
soon
became
a
favorite
occupation
among
these
men
to
give
certain
leisure
hours
to
dante
the
cambridge
dante
society
added
not
a
little
to
the
knowledge
of
the
poet
longfellow
translation
and
edition
of
works
was
a
monumental
achievement
for
which
its
author
is
likely
to
be
remembered
better
by
future
generations
than
perhaps
for
any
of
his
original
work
future
generations
are
likely
to
remember
james
russell
lowell
for
his
essays
on
dante
and
shakespeare
better
than
for
anything
else
his
dante
monograph
is
as
magnificently
illuminating
as
that
of
dean
church
and
perhaps
even
more
satisfying
to
critical
readers
that
these
men
should
have
been
content
to
give
so
much
of
their
time
to
the
study
of
the
thirteenth
century
poet
shows
in
what
appreciation
he
must
be
held
by
the
rest
of
us
if
we
would
give
him
his
due
place
in
literature
there
are
many
misunderstandings
with
regard
to
dante
which
apparently
only
some
serious
study
of
the
poet
serves
to
remove
satisfactorily
most
people
consider
that
he
was
a
distant
prophetic
religious
genius
and
that
his
poetry
has
in
it
very
little
of
sympathy
for
humanity
while
it
is
generally
conceded
that
he
saw
man
projected
on
the
curtain
of
eternity
and
realized
all
his
relationships
to
the
universe
and
to
his
creator
better
than
perhaps
any
other
poet
of
all
time
it
is
usually
thought
that
one
must
have
something
of
the
medieval
frame
of
mind
in
order
to
read
him
with
interest
and
admiration
such
impressions
are
largely
the
result
of
reading
only
a
few
lines
of
dante
and
finding
them
difficult
of
thorough
comprehension
allowing
one
self
to
be
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
he
is
not
of
interest
to
the
modern
reader
the
inferno
being
the
first
part
of
dante
great
poem
is
the
one
oftenest
read
in
this
passing
fashion
and
so
many
ideas
with
regard
to
dante
are
derived
from
this
portion
which
is
not
only
not
the
masterpiece
of
the
work
but
if
taken
alone
sadly
misrepresents
the
genius
of
the
poet
his
is
no
morbid
sentimentality
and
does
not
need
the
adventitious
interest
of
supreme
suffering
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
purgatorio
is
a
much
better
introduction
to
dante
real
greatness
and
is
considered
by
the
generality
of
dante
scholars
as
the
more
humanly
sympathetic
if
not
really
the
supreme
expression
of
his
creative
faculty
the
ascent
of
the
mount
of
expiation
with
its
constant
note
of
hope
and
the
gradually
increasing
facility
of
the
ascent
as
the
summit
is
approached
touches
condolent
cords
in
the
human
heart
and
arouses
feelings
that
are
close
to
what
is
best
in
human
aspiration
in
spite
of
its
consciousness
of
defect
over
and
over
again
in
the
purgatorio
one
finds
evidence
of
wonderful
powers
of
observation
the
poet
is
first
of
all
according
to
the
etymology
of
the
word
a
creator
one
who
gives
life
to
the
figments
of
his
imagination
so
that
we
recognize
them
as
vital
manifestations
of
human
genius
but
is
also
the
seer
the
man
who
sees
deeper
into
things
and
sees
more
of
them
than
anyone
else
ordinarily
dante
is
considered
by
those
who
do
not
know
him
as
not
having
been
an
observer
of
things
human
and
around
him
in
life
there
are
passages
in
his
works
however
that
entirely
refute
this
illustration
angel
rheims
the
story
that
he
went
about
the
cities
of
north
italy
during
his
exile
with
countenance
so
gloomy
and
stare
so
fixed
that
men
pointed
to
him
and
spoke
of
him
as
one
who
had
visited
hell
and
the
other
tradition
however
well
it
may
be
founded
that
the
women
sometimes
pointed
him
out
to
their
children
and
then
used
the
memory
of
him
as
a
bogy
man
to
scare
them
into
doing
unpleasant
things
afterwards
would
seem
to
indicate
that
he
had
occupied
himself
very
little
with
the
things
around
him
and
that
above
all
he
had
paid
very
little
attention
to
the
ways
of
childhood
he
has
shown
over
and
over
again
especially
in
the
purgatorio
that
the
simplest
and
most
natural
actions
of
had
been
engraved
upon
his
heart
for
he
uses
them
with
supreme
truth
in
his
figures
he
knows
how
an
infant
seeks
his
mother
breast
when
fear
or
anguish
vex
his
troubled
heart
but
he
knows
too
how
the
child
who
has
done
wrong
confesses
its
faults
as
little
children
dumb
with
shame
keen
smart
will
listening
stand
with
eyes
upon
the
ground
owning
their
faults
with
penitential
heart
so
then
stood
i
there
is
a
passage
in
the
inferno
in
which
he
describes
so
vividly
the
rescue
of
a
child
from
the
flames
by
its
mother
that
plumptre
has
even
ventured
to
suggest
that
dante
himself
may
have
been
the
actual
subject
of
the
rescue
because
it
helps
to
an
appreciation
of
intensity
of
expression
and
poignancy
of
vision
the
passage
itself
with
plumptre
comment
seems
deserving
of
quotation
then
suddenly
my
guide
his
arms
did
fling
around
me
as
a
mother
roused
by
cries
sees
the
fierce
flames
around
her
gathering
and
takes
her
boy
nor
ever
halts
but
flies
caring
for
him
than
for
herself
far
more
though
one
scant
shift
her
only
robe
supplies
it
must
not
be
thought
however
that
dante
quality
as
an
observer
was
limited
to
the
actions
of
human
beings
his
capacity
to
see
many
other
things
is
amply
manifested
in
his
great
poem
even
the
smallest
of
living
things
that
would
surely
be
thought
beneath
his
notice
became
the
subject
of
similies
that
show
how
much
everything
in
nature
interested
the
spirit
of
genius
the
passage
with
regard
to
the
ants
has
often
been
quoted
and
is
indeed
a
surprising
manifestation
of
nature
study
at
an
unexpected
time
and
from
an
entirely
unanticipated
quarter
dante
saw
the
souls
of
those
who
were
so
soon
to
enter
into
the
realm
of
blessedness
and
who
were
already
in
the
last
circle
of
purgatory
greeting
each
other
with
the
kiss
of
peace
and
his
picturesque
simile
for
it
is
so
oft
within
their
dusk
brown
host
proceed
this
ant
and
that
till
muzzle
muzzle
meet
spying
their
way
or
how
affairs
succeed
as
for
the
birds
his
pages
are
full
of
references
to
them
and
all
of
his
bird
similies
are
couched
in
terms
that
show
how
sympathetically
observant
he
was
of
their
habits
and
ways
he
knows
their
different
methods
of
flying
in
groups
and
singly
he
has
observed
them
on
their
nests
and
knows
their
wonderful
maternal
anxiety
for
their
young
and
describes
it
with
a
vividness
that
would
do
credit
to
a
naturalist
of
the
modern
time
who
had
made
his
home
in
the
woods
indeed
some
of
his
figures
taken
from
birds
constitute
examples
of
the
finest
passages
of
poetic
description
of
living
nature
that
have
ever
been
written
the
domestic
animals
moreover
especially
the
cat
and
the
dog
come
in
for
their
share
of
this
sympathetic
observance
and
he
is
able
to
add
greatly
to
the
vividness
of
the
pictures
he
paints
by
his
references
to
the
habits
of
these
animals
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
tradition
has
grown
up
that
he
was
fond
of
such
pets
and
possessed
several
of
them
that
were
to
the
early
commentators
on
his
poems
and
the
subject
of
no
little
erudition
nothing
escaped
the
attention
of
this
acute
observer
in
the
world
around
him
and
over
and
over
again
one
finds
surprising
bits
of
observation
with
regard
to
natural
phenomena
usually
supposed
to
be
quite
out
of
the
range
of
the
interest
of
medieval
students
generally
and
above
all
of
literary
men
of
this
middle
age
alexander
von
humboldt
calls
attention
in
a
passage
in
his
cosmos
to
the
wonderful
description
of
the
river
of
light
in
the
thirtieth
canto
of
the
paradiso
i
saw
a
glory
like
a
stream
flow
by
in
brightness
rushing
and
on
either
shore
were
banks
that
with
spring
wondrous
hues
might
vie
and
from
that
river
living
sparks
did
soar
and
sank
on
all
sides
in
the
bloom
like
precious
rubies
set
in
golden
then
as
if
drunk
with
all
the
rich
perfume
back
to
the
wondrous
torrent
did
they
roll
and
as
one
sank
another
filled
its
room
humboldt
explains
this
as
follows
with
a
suggestion
that
deserves
to
be
remembered
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
this
picture
had
its
origin
in
the
poet
recollection
of
that
peculiar
and
rare
phosphorescent
condition
of
the
ocean
in
which
luminous
points
appear
to
rise
from
the
breaking
waves
and
spreading
themselves
over
the
surface
of
the
waters
convert
the
liquid
plain
into
a
moving
sea
of
sparkling
stars
probably
the
best
way
for
a
modern
to
realize
how
much
of
interest
there
may
be
for
him
in
dante
is
to
consider
the
great
italian
epic
poet
in
comparison
with
our
greatest
of
english
epic
poets
milton
while
any
such
comparison
in
the
expressive
latin
phrase
is
sure
to
walk
lame
it
serves
to
give
an
excellent
idea
of
the
methods
of
the
two
men
in
the
illustration
of
their
ideas
we
venture
therefore
to
quote
a
comparison
between
these
two
poets
from
a
distinguished
critic
who
knows
both
of
them
well
and
whose
modern
training
in
english
methods
of
thought
would
seem
to
make
him
likely
to
be
partial
to
the
more
modern
poet
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
constantly
leans
toward
the
great
medieval
bard
the
poetry
of
milton
differs
from
that
of
dante
as
the
hieroglyphics
of
egypt
differ
from
the
of
mexico
the
images
which
dante
employs
speak
for
themselves
they
stand
simply
for
what
they
are
those
of
milton
have
a
signification
which
is
often
discernible
only
to
the
initiated
however
strange
however
grotesque
he
never
shrinks
from
describing
it
he
gives
us
the
shape
the
color
the
sound
the
smell
the
taste
he
counts
the
numbers
he
measures
the
size
his
similies
are
the
illustrations
of
a
traveler
unlike
those
of
other
poets
and
especially
of
milton
they
are
introduced
in
a
plain
manner
not
for
the
sake
of
any
of
the
beauty
in
the
objects
from
which
they
are
drawn
not
for
the
sake
of
any
ornament
they
may
impart
to
the
poem
but
simply
in
order
to
make
the
meaning
of
the
writer
as
clear
to
the
reader
as
it
is
to
himself
still
more
striking
is
the
similarity
between
dante
and
milton
this
may
be
said
to
lie
rather
in
the
kindred
nature
of
their
subjects
and
in
the
parallel
development
of
their
minds
than
in
any
mere
external
resemblance
in
both
the
man
was
greater
than
the
poet
the
souls
of
both
were
a
star
and
dwelt
apart
both
were
academically
trained
in
the
deepest
studies
of
their
age
the
labour
which
made
dante
lean
made
milton
blind
the
sweetnesse
of
the
english
poet
is
not
absent
from
the
tender
pages
of
the
vita
nuova
the
middle
life
of
each
was
spent
in
active
controversy
each
lent
his
services
to
the
state
each
felt
the
quarrels
of
his
age
to
be
the
of
posterity
and
left
his
warnings
to
ring
in
the
ears
of
a
later
time
the
lives
of
both
were
failures
evil
days
though
fallen
and
evil
tongues
they
gathered
the
concentrated
experience
of
their
lives
into
one
immortal
work
the
quintessence
of
their
hopes
their
knowledge
and
their
sufferings
but
dante
is
something
more
than
this
voice
is
grown
faint
to
us
we
have
passed
into
other
modes
of
expression
and
of
thought
the
comparison
with
vergil
is
still
more
striking
and
more
favorable
to
the
italian
poet
dante
reputation
has
passed
through
many
vicissitudes
and
much
trouble
has
been
spent
by
critics
in
comparing
him
with
other
poets
of
established
fame
read
and
commented
upon
in
the
italian
universities
in
the
generation
immediately
succeeding
his
death
his
name
bcame
obscured
as
the
sun
of
the
renaissance
rose
higher
towards
its
meridian
in
the
seventeenth
century
he
was
less
read
than
petrarch
tasso
or
ariosto
in
the
eighteenth
he
was
almost
universally
neglected
his
fame
is
now
fully
vindicated
translations
and
commentaries
issue
from
every
press
in
europe
and
america
dante
societies
are
formed
to
investigate
the
difficulties
of
his
works
he
occupies
in
the
of
regenerated
italy
a
place
by
the
side
of
those
great
masters
whose
humble
disciple
he
avowed
himself
to
be
the
divine
comedy
is
indeed
as
true
an
epic
as
the
aeneid
and
dante
is
as
real
a
classic
as
vergil
his
metre
is
as
pliable
and
flexible
to
every
mood
of
emotion
his
diction
as
plaintive
and
as
sonorous
like
him
he
can
immortalize
by
a
simple
expression
a
person
a
place
or
a
phase
of
nature
dante
is
even
truer
in
description
than
vergil
whether
he
paints
the
snow
falling
in
the
alps
or
the
homeward
flight
of
birds
or
the
swelling
of
an
angry
torrent
but
under
this
gorgeous
pageantry
of
poetry
there
lies
a
unity
of
conception
a
power
of
philosophic
grasp
an
earnestness
of
religion
which
to
the
roman
poet
were
entirely
unknown
if
we
would
have
a
very
recent
opinion
as
to
the
position
of
dante
as
a
literary
man
and
as
a
great
intellectual
force
perhaps
no
better
can
be
obtained
than
from
some
recent
expressions
of
michael
rossetti
whose
italian
descent
english
training
and
literary
and
artistic
heredity
seem
to
place
him
in
an
ideal
position
for
writing
this
generation
ultimate
judgment
with
regard
to
the
great
poet
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
his
literature
of
italy
he
said
one
has
to
recur
time
after
time
to
that
astounding
protagonist
phenomenon
and
hero
dante
alighieri
if
one
were
to
say
that
italian
literature
consists
of
dante
it
would
no
doubt
be
an
exaggeration
and
a
gross
one
and
yet
it
would
contain
a
certain
ultimate
nucleus
of
truth
dante
fixed
the
italian
language
and
everyone
had
to
tread
in
his
vestiges
he
embodied
all
the
learning
and
thought
of
his
age
and
transcended
them
he
went
far
ahead
of
all
his
predecessors
contemporaries
and
successors
he
wrote
the
first
remarkable
book
in
italian
prose
la
vita
nuova
and
a
critical
exposition
of
it
in
the
convito
in
latin
a
linguistic
treatise
the
de
vulgari
eloquio
which
upholds
the
vulgare
illustre
or
speech
of
the
best
cultivated
classes
markedly
in
tuscany
and
bologna
against
the
common
dialects
and
a
political
study
de
monarchia
of
the
most
fundamental
quality
which
even
to
us
moderns
continues
to
be
sane
and
convincing
in
its
essence
though
its
direct
line
of
argument
has
collapsed
and
finally
and
most
important
by
far
he
produced
in
la
commedia
divina
the
one
poem
of
modern
europe
that
shakespeare
and
challenges
antiquity
this
is
the
sole
book
which
makes
it
a
real
pity
for
anyone
to
be
ignorant
of
italian
regarded
singly
it
is
much
the
most
astonishing
poem
in
the
world
dwarfing
all
others
by
its
theme
pulverizing
most
of
them
by
its
majesty
and
sustainment
unique
in
the
force
of
its
paraded
personality
and
the
thunderous
reverberation
of
its
judgments
on
the
living
and
the
dead
xx
the
women
of
the
century
in
generations
whose
men
proved
so
unending
in
initiative
and
so
forceful
in
accomplishment
so
commanding
in
intelligence
so
persistent
in
their
purposes
so
acute
in
their
searching
so
successful
in
their
endeavors
the
women
of
the
time
could
not
have
been
unworthy
of
them
some
hints
of
this
have
been
already
given
in
what
has
been
said
about
the
making
of
furnishings
for
the
church
especially
in
the
matter
of
needlework
and
the
handpainting
of
various
forms
of
ornaments
there
are
further
intimations
in
the
histories
of
the
time
though
unfortunately
not
very
definite
information
with
regard
to
even
more
ambitious
accomplishments
by
the
women
of
the
period
there
are
for
instance
traditions
that
the
designs
for
some
of
the
cathedrals
and
certainly
for
portions
of
many
of
them
came
from
women
hands
it
is
in
the
ethical
sphere
however
that
women
accomplished
great
things
during
the
thirteenth
century
their
influence
stood
for
what
was
best
and
highest
in
the
life
of
the
time
and
their
example
encouraged
not
only
their
own
generation
but
many
people
in
many
subsequent
generations
to
look
up
not
down
to
look
within
not
without
for
happiness
and
to
trust
that
god
in
his
heaven
and
all
well
with
the
world
there
are
a
number
of
women
of
the
time
whose
names
the
race
will
not
let
die
while
if
the
ordinary
person
were
asked
to
enumerate
the
great
women
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
would
be
rare
to
find
one
able
properly
to
place
them
as
soon
as
their
names
are
mentioned
it
will
be
recognized
that
they
succeeded
in
accomplishing
work
of
such
significance
that
the
world
is
not
likely
to
let
the
reputation
of
it
perish
some
of
these
names
are
household
words
the
bearers
of
them
have
been
written
of
at
length
in
quite
recent
years
in
english
as
well
as
in
other
languages
their
work
was
of
the
kind
that
ordinarily
stands
quite
apart
from
the
course
of
history
and
so
dates
are
usually
not
attached
to
it
it
is
thought
of
as
a
portion
of
the
precious
heritage
of
mankind
rather
than
as
belonging
to
any
particular
period
three
names
occur
at
once
they
are
clare
of
assisi
elizabeth
of
hungary
and
queen
blanche
of
castile
the
mother
of
louis
to
these
should
be
added
queen
berengaria
the
sister
of
blanche
and
the
mother
of
ferdinand

mabel
rich
the
london

wife
the

the
present
day
interest
in
francis
of
assisi
has
brought
clare
under
the
of
publicity
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
that
her
name
is
well
worthy
to
be
mentioned
along
with
his
and
that
she
like
him
must
be
considered
one
of
the
strongest
and
most
beautiful
characters
of
all
time
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
noble
family
at
assisi
who
having
heard
francis
preach
became
impressed
with
the
idea
that
she
too
should
have
the
opportunity
to
live
the
simple
life
that
francis
pictured
of
course
her
family
opposed
her
in
any
such
notion
that
a
daughter
of
theirs
should
take
up
with
a
wandering
preacher
who
at
that
time
was
looked
on
not
a
little
askance
by
the
regular
religious
authorities
and
whose
rags
and
poverty
made
him
anything
but
a
proper
associate
for
a
young
lady
of
noble
birth
could
not
but
seem
an
impossible
idea
accordingly
clare
ran
away
from
home
and
told
francis
that
she
would
never
go
back
and
that
he
must
help
her
to
live
her
life
in
poverty
just
as
he
was
doing
himself
he
sent
her
to
a
neighboring
convent
to
be
cared
for
and
also
very
probably
so
as
to
be
assured
of
her
vocation
after
a
time
a
special
convent
home
for
clare
and
some
other
young
women
who
had
become
enamored
with
the
life
of
poverty
and
simplicity
was
established
and
to
this
clare
sister
agnes
came
as
a
postulant
by
this
time
apparently
the
family
had
become
reconciled
to
absence
from
home
but
they
would
not
stand
another
daughter
following
such
a
foolish
example
accordingly
agnes
was
removed
from
the
convent
by
force
after
a
scene
which
caused
the
greatest
excitement
in
the
little
town
it
was
not
long
however
before
agnes
returned
to
the
convent
and
within
a
few
years
their
mother
followed
them
and
became
one
of
the
most
fervent
members
of
the
little
community
illustration
clare
farewell
to
the
dead
francis
giotto
the
peace
and
happiness
that
came
with
this
life
of
absolute
poverty
soon
attracted
many
other
women
and
clare
was
asked
to
establish
houses
at
a
distance
gradually
the
order
of
poor
clares
the
second
order
of
francis
thus
came
into
existence
when
it
was
necessary
to
draw
up
constitutions
for
the
order
clare
showed
not
only
the
breadth
of
her
intelligence
but
the
depth
of
her
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
her
appreciation
of
what
was
absolutely
necessary
in
order
to
keep
her
order
from
degeneration
against
the
counsels
of
all
the
ecclesiastics
of
her
time
including
many
cardinals
and
even
a
pope
she
insisted
on
the
most
absolute
poverty
as
the
only
basis
for
the
preservation
of
the
spirit
of
her
second
order
of
francis
her
character
was
well
manifested
in
this
contest
from
which
she
came
out
victorious
her
body
has
been
miraculously
preserved
and
may
still
be
seen
at
assisi
anyone
who
has
seen
the
strongly
set
lips
and
full
firm
chin
of
the
body
in
the
crypt
of
san
damiano
can
easily
understand
the
strength
of
purpose
and
of
character
of
this
young
woman
who
moulded
a
generation
to
her
will
the
story
is
told
of
her
that
once
when
the
saracens
invaded
italy
and
attacked
the
convent
she
mounted
the
walls
with
a
monstrance
containing
the
blessed
sacrament
in
her
hands
and
the
marauders
turned
away
in
consternation
from
the
stern
brave
figure
that
confronted
them
and
bothered
the
nuns
no
more
after
francis
death
she
more
than
anyone
else
succeeded
in
maintaining
the
spirit
of
the
franciscan
order
in
the
way
in
which
francis
would
have
it
go
long
after
her
death
a
copy
of
the
original
rules
was
found
in
the
fold
of
her
garments
and
did
much
to
restore
the
franciscan
life
to
its
primitive
simplicity
and
purpose
so
that
even
after
she
was
no
more
on
earth
she
was
still
the
guardian
and
promoter
of
francis
work
if
one
wants
to
know
how
much
of
happiness
there
came
to
her
in
life
one
should
read
the
famous
passage
which
describes
her
visit
to
francis
and
how
she
and
he
with
sisters
and
brothers
around
them
broke
bread
together
with
a
sweetness
that
was
beyond
human
the
passage
is
to
be
found
in
the
little
flowers
of
francis
of
assisi
which
was
written
within
a
century
after
the
occurrences
described
it
recalls
nothing
so
much
as
the
story
of
the
disciples
at
emaus
and
is
worthy
to
be
thought
of
beside
the
scripture

wondrously

the

the

thither

great

coming
closer
up

finding
no

at
all
they
entered
within
and
found
saint
francis
and
saint
clare
and
all
their
company
in
contemplation
rapt
in
god
and
sitting
around
that
humble
board
whereby
of
a
truth
they
understood
that
this
had
been
a
heavenly
flame
and
no
earthly
one
at
all
which
god
had
let
appear
miraculously
for
to
show
and
signify
the
fire
of
love
divine
wherewith
the
souls
of
those
holy
brothers
and
holy
nuns
were
all
aflame

what
saint
clare
accomplished
as
her
life
work
was
the
making
of
a
new
vocation
for
women
there
are
always
a
certain
number
of
women
who
look
for
peace
and
quiet
rather
than
the
struggle
for
existence
for
these
the
older
monasteries
did
not
supply
a
place
unless
they
were
of
the
wealthier
class
as
a
rule
among
the
poor
clares
women
of
all
classes
were
received
in
this
way
a
great
practical
lesson
in
equality
was
taught
women
did
not
have
to
marry
perhaps
unsuitable
often
even
objectionable
men
simply
in
order
to
have
a
mode
of
life
they
could
join
one
of
these
communities
and
though
in
absolute
poverty
with
many
hours
each
day
devoted
to
meditation
and
prayer
had
time
to
give
to
beautiful
needlework
to
painting
and
book
illumination
and
to
other
feminine
occupations
and
might
thus
pass
long
happy
lives
apart
from
the
bustle
of
the
strenuous
time
italy
at
this
time
it
must
be
recalled
was
a
seething
cauldron
of
political
and
military
strife
wars
were
waged
and
struggles
of
all
kinds
engaged
in
for
precedence
and
power
these
women
got
away
from
this
unfortunate
state
of
affairs
occasionally
in
times
of
pestilence
when
they
were
specially
needed
as
happened
at
least
once
in
saint
clare
life
they
took
care
of
the
ailing
and
lent
their
convent
as
a
hospital
above
all
they
stood
in
the
eyes
of
their
generation
for
chosen
people
who
saw
things
differently
from
others
they
taught
the
great
lesson
of
not
caring
too
much
for
the
things
of
this
world
and
of
not
living
one
life
in
order
to
get
admiration
though
usually
envy
comes
nor
idle
praise
for
qualities
they
either
do
not
possess
or
that
are
not
worthy
of
notice
they
showed
people
the
real
value
of
this
life
by
its
reflection
upon
the
other
many
a
man
turned
aside
from
ambitious
schemes
that
would
have
injured
others
because
of
the
kindly
influence
of
these
unselfish
women
and
because
of
the
memory
of
a
sister
or
an
aunt
whose
sacrificing
life
was
thus
a
rebuke
to
his
foolish
selfishness
other
women
learned
something
of
the
vanity
of
human
things
by
learning
to
value
the
character
of
these
poor
clares
and
realizing
how
much
of
happiness
came
to
them
from
the
accomplishment
of
their
simple
duties
professor
osler
said
in
his
lecture
on
science
and
immortality
of
these
ones
the
serene
faith
of
socrates
with
the
cup
of
hemlock
at
his
lips
the
heroic
devotion
of
a
francis
or
a
teresa
but
more
often
for
each
one
of
us
the
beautiful
life
of
some
good
woman
whose
eyes
are
homes
of
silent
prayer
whose
loves
in
higher
love
endure
do
more
to
keep
alive
among
the
laodiceans
a
belief
in
immortality
than
all
the
preaching
in
the
land
this
is
what
clare
accomplished
for
her
own
generation
and
her
influence
is
still
a
great
living
force
in
the
world
what
especially
should
attract
the
attention
of
the
modern
time
is
the
perfect
basis
of
equality
on
which
the
franciscan
and
dominican
orders
of
men
and
of
women
were
organized
each
community
had
the
opportunity
to
elect
its
own
superiors
the
rules
were
practically
the
same
for
the
first
for
men
and
the
second
for
women
order
of
francis
except
that
while
the
first
order
were
supposed
to
live
on
alms
collected
by
begging
from
door
to
door
this
menial
obligation
was
not
imposed
upon
the
women
who
were
expected
to
be
supported
by
alms
brought
to
their
convents
by
the
faithful
and
by
the
labor
of
their
own
hands
this
equality
of
men
and
women
in
the
monastic
establishments
became
widespread
after
the
thirteenth
century
and
made
itself
felt
in
the
social
order
of
the
time
as
a
factor
for
feminine
uplift
undoubtedly
saint
clare
work
in
the
foundation
of
the
second
order
of
francis
must
be
held
responsible
to
no
small
degree
for
this
before
her
death
there
were
half
a
dozen
scions
of
royal
families
in
various
parts
of
europe
who
had
become
members
of
her
order
and
literally
hundreds
of
the
daughters
of
the
nobility
many
of
them
of
high
rank
had
put
off
their
dignity
and
position
in
the
world
to
become
poor
daughters
of
saint
clare
they
did
so
for
the
peace
and
the
happiness
of
the
vocation
and
the
opportunity
to
seek
their
souls
and
live
their
lives
in
their
own
quiet
way
which
her
convents
afforded
them

the
best
known
woman
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
undoubtedly
saint
elizabeth
of
hungary
of
whom
the
world
knows
some
pretty
legends
while
the
serious
historian
recognizes
that
she
was
the
first
settlement
worker
of
history
as
a
child
she
wandered
down
from
the
castle
walls
in
which
she
lived
and
saw
the
poor
in
their
suffering
she
felt
so
much
for
them
that
she
stripped
herself
of
most
of
her
garments
and
finally
even
of
her
shoes
in
order
to
clothe
them
when
she
was
taken
to
task
for
this
she
said
that
she
had
suffered
whatever
inconvenience
there
was
in
it
only
for
a
few
minutes
while
the
poor
had
suffered
all
their
lives
she
became
the
wife
of
the
duke
of
thuringia
and
there
were
three
years
of
ideal
happiness
with
her
husband
and
her
children
when
he
went
away
on
the
crusade
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
care
of
the
poor
when
he
died
though
she
was
only
twenty
and
according
to
tradition
one
of
the
handsomest
women
of
her
time
she
devoted
herself
still
more
to
her
poor
and
even
went
to
live
among
them
she
tried
to
teach
them
as
do
the
settlement
workers
of
the
modern
time
something
of
the
true
significance
of
life
to
bring
them
to
realize
to
some
degree
at
least
that
so
many
of
the
things
they
so
vainly
desire
are
not
worth
thinking
about
but
that
happiness
consists
in
lopping
off
one
desires
rather
than
trying
vainly
as
it
must
ever
be
to
satisfy
them
it
is
no
wonder
that
throughout
all
germany
she
came
to
be
called
the
dear
st
elizabeth
literally
thousands
of
women
since
her
time
have
turned
to
read
the
story
of
her
beautiful
devotion
to
charity
and
have
been
incited
by
her
example
to
do
more
and
more
for
the
poor
around
them
those
who
know
it
only
through
kingsley
the
saint
tragedy
though
this
is
disfigured
by
many
failures
to
understand
parts
of
her
career
and
her
environment
can
scarcely
fail
to
realize
that
hers
was
one
of
the
world
sublimely
beautiful
characters
all
she
attempted
in
the
thorny
paths
of
charity
was
accomplished
in
such
a
practical
way
that
the
amount
of
good
done
was
almost
incalculable
the
simple
recital
of
what
she
did
as
it
has
often
been
told
is
the
story
of
a
great
individuality
that
impressed
itself
deeply
upon
its
generation
and
left
the
example
of
a
precious
life
to
act
as
a
leaven
for
good
in
the
midst
of
the
social
fermentations
of
succeeding
generations
yet
elizabeth
succeeded
in
accomplishing
all
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
born
the
daughter
of
a
king
and
married
the
reigning
prince
of
one
of
the
most
important
ducal
houses
in
germany
one
would
expect
to
find
that
her
life
had
been
long
so
many
traditions
have
gathered
around
her
name
she
was
twenty
when
her
husband
died
and
she
survived
him
only
four
years
literally
she
had
accomplished
a
long
space
in
a
short
time
and
her
generation
in
raising
in
her
honor
the
charming
gothic
cathedral
at
marburg
one
of
the
most
beautiful
in
germany
was
honoring
itself
nobly
as
well
as
her
it
is
the
greatest
monument
to
a
woman
in
all
the
world
the
next
great
woman
of
the
century
also
belonged
to
a
reigning
family
and
is
for
obvious
historical
reasons
better
known
perhaps
than
her
saint
contemporaries
this
was
blanche
daughter
of
the
king
of
castile
but
intimately
related
to
the
english
royal
family
married
to
louis
viii
of
france
she
is
known
principally
as
the
mother
of
louis
ix
she
ruled
france
for
many
years
while
her
boy
was
a
minor
and
when
he
came
to
the
age
when
he
might
ordinarily
assume
the
reins
of
government
he
voluntarily
permitted
his
mother
to
continue
her
regency
for
some
time
longer
france
was
probably
happier
under
her
than
under
any
ruler
that
the
country
has
ever
had
with
the
possible
exception
of
her
son
louis
she
succeeded
in
suppressing
to
a
great
extent
the
quarrels
so
common
among
the
nobility
she
strengthened
and
centralized
the
power
of
the
crown
she
began
the
correction
of
abuses
in
the
administration
of
justice
which
her
son
was
to
complete
so
well
she
organized
charity
in
various
ways
and
the
court
was
an
example
to
the
kingdom
of
simple
dignified
life
without
any
abuse
of
power
or
wealth
or
passion
no
wonder
that
when
louis
went
on
the
crusade
he
left
his
mother
to
reign
in
his
stead
confident
that
all
would
go
well
if
one
needed
a
demonstration
that
women
can
rule
well
there
is
an
excellent
example
in
the
life
of
blanche
personally
she
seems
to
have
had
not
only
an
amiable
but
a
deeply
intellectual
character
she
encouraged
education
and
beautiful
and
the
gothic
architecture
which
was
developing
in
france
so
wonderfully
during
her
period
of
course
she
also
worshipped
her
boy
louis
but
how
much
her
motherly
tenderness
was
tempered
with
the
most
beautiful
christian
feeling
can
be
understood
from
the
famous
expression
attributed
to
her
on
good
authority
that
she
would
rather
see
her
boy
dead
at
her
feet
than
have
him
commit
a
mortal
offense
against
his
god
or
his
neighbor
one
might
almost
say
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
louis
became
a
saint
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
attributed
to
his
mother
whatever
of
goodness
there
was
in
himself
there
is
a
touch
of
humanity
in
the
picture
however
a
trait
that
shows
that
blanche
was
a
woman
though
it
is
a
fault
which
draws
our
sympathy
to
her
even
more
surely
than
if
she
were
the
type
of
perfection
she
might
have
been
without
it
she
did
not
get
on
well
with
her
and
one
of
the
trials
of
louis
life
as
we
have
said
was
to
keep
the
scales
evenly
balanced
between
his
mother
and
his
wife
both
of
whom
he
loved
very
dearly
after
blanche
life
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
a
woman
when
given
the
opportunity
can
manage
men
and
administer
government
quite
as
well
as
any
masculine
member
of
the
race
and
the
thirteenth
century
had
given
another
example
of
its
power
to
bring
out
what
was
best
in
its
fortunate
children
one
of
the
most
interesting
women
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
neither
a
saint
nor
a
member
of
the
nobility
but
only
the
wife
of
a
simple
london
merchant
this
was
mabel
rich
the
mother
of
saint
edmund
of
canterbury
edmund
is
one
of
the
striking
men
of
a
supreme
century
he
had
been
a
student
at
paris
and
later
a
professor
at
oxford
then
he
became
the
treasurer
of
the
cathedral
at
salisbury
about
the
time
when
not
a
little
through
his
influence
that
magnificent
edifice
was
receiving
the
form
which
was
to
make
it
one
of
the
world
great
churches
for
all
time
later
he
was
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
while
defending
the
rights
of
his
church
and
his
people
came
under
the
ban
of
henry
iii
and
spent
most
of
the
latter
years
of
his
life
in
exile
on
the
continent
edmund
insisted
that
he
owed
more
to
his
mother
than
to
any
other
single
factor
in
life
with
her
two
boys
aged
ten
and
fourteen
mabel
rich
was
left
to
care
for
the
worldly
concerns
of
the
household
as
well
as
for
their
education
when
they
were
twelve
and
sixteen
with
many
misgivings
she
sent
them
off
to
the
university
of
paris
to
get
their
education
edmund
tells
how
besides
packing
their
linen
very
carefully
she
also
packed
a
hairshirt
for
each
of
them
which
they
were
to
wear
occasionally
according
to
their
promise
to
her
to
remind
them
that
they
must
not
look
for
ease
and
comfort
in
life
above
all
must
not
yield
to
sensual
pleasures
but
must
be
ready
to
suffer
many
little
troubles
voluntarily
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
resist
temptation
when
severer
trials
came
mabel
rich
believed
in
discipline
as
a
factor
in
education
and
thought
that
character
was
formed
by
habits
of
fortitude
in
resisting
petty
annoyances
until
finally
even
serious
troubles
were
easy
to
bear
both
of
her
sons
proved
worthy
of
her
maternal
solicitude
edmund
tells
how
the
poor
around
her
home
in
london
blessed
her
for
her
charity
all
during
his
life
the
thought
of
his
mother
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
in
the
immortality
that
has
been
given
his
name
because
of
the
utter
forgetfulness
of
self
which
characterized
his
life
his
mother
has
been
associated
unfortunately
details
are
lacking
that
would
show
us
something
of
the
manner
of
living
of
this
strong
woman
of
the
people
but
we
know
enough
to
make
us
realize
that
she
was
a
fine
type
of
the
christian
mother
memory
of
whose
goodness
means
more
not
only
for
her
children
but
for
all
those
who
come
in
contact
with
her
than
all
the
sermons
and
pious
exhortations
that
they
hear
and
often
such
is
the
way
of
human
nature
even
than
the
divine
commandments
or
the
personal
conscience
of
those
whom
she
loves
there
were
noble
women
among
the
gentlewomen
of
england
at
this
time
too
and
though
space
will
not
let
us
dwell
on
them
at
least
one
must
be
mentioned
this
is
the
famous
isabella

who
with
a
dignity
which
matthew
paris
says
was
more
than
that

woman
reproached
henry
iii
when
he
sought
to
browbeat
her
she
made
bold
to
tell
the
king
you
govern
neither
us
nor
yourself
well
on
this
the
king
with
a
sneer
and
a
grin
said

voice
ho

the
noblemen
of
england
granted
you
a
charter

struck
a
bargain
with
you
to
become
their
spokeswoman
because
of
your
eloquence
she
answered
my
liege
the
nobles
have
made
no
charter
but
you
and
your
father
have
made
a
charter
and
you
have
sworn
to
observe
it
inviolably
and

a
hint
of
one
form
of
woman
occupation
has
already
been
given
in
discussing
the
needlework
done
for
the
cathedrals
and
especially
the
cope
of
ascoli
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
this
was
the
age
not
alone
of
cathedrals
but
also
of
monasteries
and
of
convents
in
all
of
these
convents
every
effort
was
made
to
have
whatever
was
associated
with
the
religious
ceremonial
as
beautiful
as
possible
hence
it
was
that
needlework
rose
to
a
height
of
accomplishment
such
as
has
never
been
reached
since
according
to
the
best
authorities
and
many
examples
of
it
have
come
down
to
us
to
confirm
such
an
opinion
this
needlework
was
done
not
only
for
religious
purposes
however
but
also
as
presents
for
kings
and
queens
and
the
nobility
and
such
presents
proved
to
be
exemplars
of
artistic
beauty
that
must
have
helped
to
raise
the
taste
of
the
time
this
was
essentially
woman
work
and
in
their
distant
castles
the
women
of
the
households
of
the
nobility
occupied
themselves
with
it
to
much
better
effect
than
their
sisters
of
the
modern
time
with
the
grievous
burden
of
their
social
duties
miss

has
given
a
pretty
yet
piquant
picture
of
woman
at
these
occupations
she
says
there
are
not
wanting
thirteenth
century
satires
to
tell
the
usual
story
of
female
levities
and
of
female
devotion
to
the
needle
to
german
work
and
pierced
work
saracen
work
and
combed
work
cutout
work
and
and
a
multitude
of
other
works
to
which
the
clue
seems
to
be
now
wholly
lost
whilst
the
women
are
thus
engaged
the
one
who
knows
most
reads
to
them
the
others
listen
attentively
and
do
not
sleep

they
do

a
cope
of
this
work
was
made
by
rose

at

order
and
sent
to

one
known

another
form
of
woman
work
that
came
to
prominence
during
the
century
was
the
service
in
hospitals
while
the
records
of
the
hospitals
of
the
holy
ghost
which
under
innocent
third
fostering
care
spread
so
widely
throughout
europe
in
this
century
are
mainly
occupied
with
the
institutions
of
the
brothers
of
the
holy
ghost
there
were
many
hospitals
under
the
care
of
women
and
indeed
there
was
an
almost
universally
accepted
idea
that
women
patients
and
obstetrical
cases
should
be
cared
for
by
women
rather
than
men
it
is
easy
to
make
little
of
the
hospitals
of
this
time
but
any
such
thought
will
be
the
result
of
ignorance
rather
than
of
any
serious
attempt
to
know
what
was
actually
accomplished
the
sisters
hospitals
soon
usurped
the
most
prominent
place
in
the
life
of
the
time
and
during
succeeding
centuries
gradually
replaced
those
which
had
been
originally
under
the
control
of
men
it
was
recognized
that
nursing
was
a
much
more
suitable
occupation
for
the
gentler
sex
and
that
there
were
many
less
abuses
than
when
men
were
employed
the
success
of
these
hospitals
in
gradually
eradicating
leprosy
and
in
keeping
down
the
from
anthony
fire
or
erysipelas
shows
how
capable
they
were
of
accomplishing
great
humanitarian
work
perhaps
the
most
interesting
feature
of
the
story
of
woman
position
during
the
thirteenth
century
is
that
at
the
italian
universities
at
least
was
not
only
admitted
in
principle
but
also
in
practice
and
many
women
were
in
attendance
at
the
universities
in
the
west
of
europe
this
feature
did
not
exist
it
is
a
startling
comment
on
how
comparatively
trivial
a
thing
may
change
the
course
of
history
that
the
lamentable
heloise
and
abelard
incident
at
the
university
of
paris
during
the
twelfth
century
precluded
all
subsequent
possibility
of
the
admission
of
women
students
to
the
university
of
paris
oxford
it
will
be
remembered
was
formed
by
the
withdrawal
of
students
from
the
university
of
paris
and
the
same
tradition
was
maintained
cambridge
was
a
of
the
university
of
paris
and
the
french
and
spanish
universities
must
all
be
considered
as
standing
in
the
relation
of
its
direct
descendants
the
unfortunate
experience
at
paris
shaped
the
policy
as
to
the
of
the
sexes
for
all
these
it
would
have
been
too
much
to
expect
that
university
authorities
would
take
the
risks
which
had
been
so
clearly
demonstrated
even
with
regard
to
a
distinguished
professor
and
so
was
excluded
it
is
not
easy
to
say
what
proportion
of
women
there
were
in
attendance
at
the
university
of
bologna
during
the
thirteenth
century
apparently
it
should
not
be
difficult
to
take
the
lists
of
the
matriculates
as
far
as
they
have
been
preserved
and
by
a
little
calculation
obtain
rather
exact
figures
italy
like
most
of
the
latin
countries
differs
from
the
teutonic
regions
in
not
being
quite
so
exact
in
the
distribution
of
names
to
the
different
sexes
that
the
first
name
inevitably
determines
whether
the
individual
is
male
or
female
it
is
not
an
unusual
thing
even
at
the
present
day
for
a
man
to
have
as
a
first
name
in
italy
or
france
or
spain
the
equivalent
of
our
name
mary
on
the
other
hand
not
a
few
girls
are
called
by
men
names
and
without
the
feminine
termination
which
is
so
distinctive
among
the
english
speaking
peoples
in
the
olden
times
this
was
still
more
the
case
until
very
recently
at
least
if
not
now
every
child
born
in
venice
was
given
two
names
at
its
baptism
maria
and
giovanni
in
honor
of
the
two
great
patron
saints
of
the
city
and
then
the
parents
might
add
further
names
if
they
so
desired
a
matriculation
list
of
the
university
of
bologna
then
tells
very
little
that
is
absolute
with
regard
to
the
sex
of
the
matriculates
all
that
we
know
for
sure
is
that
there
were
women
students
at
the
university
of
bologna
apparently
from
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
that
some
of
them
secured
the
distinction
of
being
made
professors
of
one
of
these
there
is
a
pretty
legend
told
which
seems
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
charming
young
women
of
profound
intellectual
qualities
did
not
lose
the
characteristic
modesty
and
thoughtfulness
for
others
of
their
sex
because
of
their
elevation
to
university
professorship
this
young
woman
maria
di
novella
when
only
became
the
professor
of
mathematics
at
the
university
of
bologna
according
to
tradition
she
was
very
pretty
and
as
is
usual
in
life
was
not
unaware
of
that
happy
accident
she
feared
that
her
good
looks
might
disturb
the
thoughts
of
her
students
during
her
lessons
and
accordingly
she
delivered
her
lectures
from
behind
a
curtain
the
story
may
of
course
be
only
a
myth
one
of
the
best
woman
educators
that
i
know
once
said
to
me
that
if
the
tradition
with
regard
to
her
beauty
were
true
then
she
doubted
the
rest
of
the
story
but
then
women
are
not
always
the
best
judges
of
the
actions
of
other
women
and
especially
is
this
true
when
there
is
question
of
a
grave
and
learned
elderly
woman
passing
judgment
on
a
young
and
handsome
professor
of
mathematics
the
italians
became
so
much
impressed
with
the
advisability
of
permitting
women
to
study
at
the
universities
that
a
certain
amount
of
has
existed
all
down
the
centuries
in
italy
and
not
a
century
has
passed
since
the
thirteenth
which
has
not
chronicled
the
presence
of
at
least
one
distinguished
woman
professor
at
some
italian
university
indeed
it
was
doubtless
the
traditional
position
of
tolerance
in
this
matter
that
made
it
seem
quite
natural
for
women
when
the
renaissance
period
came
around
to
take
their
places
beside
their
brothers
and
their
cousins
in
the
schools
where
the
new
learning
was
being
taught
it
may
be
rather
difficult
for
some
to
understand
how
with
this
opening
wedge
for
the
higher
education
of
women
well
placed
the
real
opportunity
for
widespread
feminine
education
should
only
have
come
in
our
own
time
this
last
idea
however
which
would
represent
ours
as
the
only
generation
which
has
given
women
adequate
opportunities
for
intellectual
development
is
one
of
those
bits
of
flattery
of
ourselves
and
our
own
period
that
is
so
irritatingly
characteristic
of
recent
times
there
have
been
at
least
three
times
in
the
world
history
before
our
own
when
as
many
women
as
wanted
them
in
the
class
most
interested
in
educational
matters
were
given
the
opportunities
for
the
higher
education
as
a
matter
of
fact
whenever
there
have
been
novelties
introduced
into
educational
systems
women
have
demanded
and
quite
naturally
since
what
a
good
woman
wants
said
a
modern
saint
is
the
will
of
god
have
obtained
the
privilege
of
sharing
the
educational
opportunities
of
the
time
this
was
true
in
charlemagne
time
when
the
women
of
the
court
attended
the
lectures
in
the
traveling
palace
school
the
great
charles
founded
and
fostered
it
was
true
four
centuries
later
as
we
have
seen
when
a
great
change
in
educational
methods
was
introduced
with
the
foundation
of
the
universities
it
was
exemplified
again
when
the
new
learning
came
in
and
the
study
of
the
classics
took
the
place
of
the
long
hours
spent
in
scholastic
disputation
that
had
previously
occupied
so
much
university
attention
in
our
own
time
it
was
the
introduction
of
the
study
of
the
social
sciences
particularly
with
the
consequent
appearance
of
many
novelties
in
the
educational
curriculum
that
once
more
was
the
signal
for
women
asking
and
quite
naturally
obtaining
educational
privileges

each
of
the
previous
experiences
in
the
matter
of
feminine
education
has
been
followed
by
a
considerable
period
during
which
there
was
a
distinct
incuriousness
on
the
part
of
women
in
educational
matters
of
course
that
is
only
an
analogy
and
though
history
is
worth
studying
only
because
the
lessons
of
the
past
are
the
warnings
of
the
future
yet
this
does
not
foretell
a
lessening
of
feminine
interest
in
educational
matters
after
a
few
generations
of
experience
of
its
vanity
to
make
up
to
them
for
the
precious
special
privileges
of
their
nature
the
proper
enjoyment
and
exercise
of
which
it
is
so
likely
to
hamper
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
just
why
feminine
education
after
a
period
of
efflorescence
during
the
thirteenth
century
retrograded
during
the
next
century
there
have
been
some
ungallant
explanations
offered
which
we
mention
merely
because
of
their
historical
interest
but
without
any
hint
of
their
having
any
real
significance
in
the
matter
a
distinguished
german
educational
authority
has
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
prepared
food
for
which
bologna
is
famous
is
first
heard
of
about
the
time
that
the
higher
education
for
women
came
into
vogue
at
the
italian
universities
towards
the
end
of
the
same
century
a
special
kind
of
pudding
since
bearing
the
name
of
its
native
city
bologna
which
might
very
well
have
taken
the
place
of
an
ordinary
dessert
also
began
to
come
into
prominence
this
german
writer
suggests
then
that
possibly
the
serving
of
meals
consisting
of
these
forms
of
prepared
food
which
did
not
require
much
household
drudgery
and
did
not
necessitate
the
bending
over
the
kitchen
range
or
whatever
took
its
place
in
those
days
may
have
led
the
men
to
grumble
about
the
effects
of
the
higher
education
after
all
he
adds
though
the
women
get
whatever
they
want
when
they
ask
for
it
seriously
if
it
proves
after
a
time
that
the
men
do
not
want
them
to
have
it
then
women
lose
interest
and
care
for
it
no
longer
this
of
course
must
be
taken
with
the
proverbial
grain
of
salt
though
it
illustrates
certain
phases
of
the
domestic
life
of
the
time
as
well
as
affording
a
possible
glimpse
into
the
inner
circle
of
the
family
life
the
real
story
of
woman
intellectual
position
in
the
century
is
to
be
found
in
its
literature
how
deep
was
the
general
culture
of
the
women
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
italy
at
least
can
be
judged
from
the
sonnets
of
dante
and
his
friends
to
their
loved
ones
at
the
end
of
this
century
some
of
the
most
beautiful
poetry
that
was
ever
written
was
inspired
by
these
women
and
like
the
law
of
hydrostatics
it
is
one
of
the
rules
of
the
history
of
poetry
that
inspiration
never
rises
higher
than
its
source
and
that
poetry
addressed
to
women
is
always
the
best
index
of
the
estimation
in
which
they
are
held
the
reflection
of
the
highest
qualities
of
the
objects
to
which
it
is
addressed
anyone
who
reads
certain
of
the
sonnets
of
dante
or
of
his
friends
guido
cavalcanti
or
gino
da
pistoia
or
dante
da
maiano
will
find
ready
assurance
of
the
high
state
of
culture
and
of
intellectual
refinement
that
must
have
existed
among
the
women
to
whom
they
were
dedicated
this
same
form
of
reasoning
will
apply
also
with
regard
to
the
women
of
the
south
of
france
to
whom
the
troubadours
addressed
their
poetry
to
those
of
the
north
of
france
who
were
greeted
by
the
trouvères
and
those
of
the
south
of
germany
for
whom
the
minnesingers
tuned
their
lyres
and
invoked
the
muses
to
enable
them
to
sing
their
praises
properly
it
would
seem
sometimes
to
be
forgotten
that
poetry
generally
is
written
much
more
for
women
than
for
men
everyone
realizes
that
for
one
man
who
has
read
tennyson
idyls
of
the
king
there
are
probably
five
women
to
whom
they
have
been
a
source
of
delight
when
we
think
of
the
thirteenth
century
as
not
affording
opportunities
of
intellectual
culture
for
its
women
we
should
ask
ourselves
where
then
did
the
meistersingers
and
the
poets
of
england
germany
and
france
who
told
their
romantic
tales
in
verse
find
an
audience
if
it
was
not
among
the
women
the
stories
selected
by
the
meistersingers
are
just
those
which
proved
so
popular
to
feminine
readers
of
tennyson
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
chosen
subjects
of
interest
in
the
stories
show
that
men
and
women
have
not
changed
much
during
the
intervening
centuries
the
literature
of
any
period
reflects
the
interest
of
the
women
in
it
and
as
interest
is
itself
an
index
of
intellectual
development
thirteenth
century
literature
must
be
taken
as
the
vivid
reflection
of
the
cultural
character
of
the
women
of
the
time
and
this
is
of
itself
the
highest
possible
tribute
to
their
intelligence
and
education
on
the
other
hand
the
best
possible
testimony
to
the
estimation
of
women
during
the
thirteenth
century
is
to
be
found
in
the
attitude
of
the
men
of
the
generations
towards
them
as
it
is
clearly
to
be
seen
in
the
literature
of
the
time
in
the
holy
graal
the
cid
the
minnesingers
and
the
meistersingers
woman
occupies
the
higher
place
in
life
and
it
is
recognized
that
she
is
the
highest
incentive
to
good
unfortunately
also
sometimes
to
evil
but
always
the
best
reward
that
men
can
have
for
their
exertions
in
a
great
cause
the
supreme
tribute
to
woman
comes
at
the
end
of
the
century
in
dante
apotheosis
of
her
in
the
divine
comedy
in
this
it
is
a
woman
who
inspires
a
woman
who
leads
a
woman
who
is
the
reward
of
man
aspirations
and
though
the
symbolism
may
be
traced
to
philosophy
the
influence
of
an
actual
woman
in
it
all
is
sure
beyond
all
doubt
nor
must
it
be
thought
that
it
was
merely
in
this
highest
flight
of
his
imagination
that
this
greatest
of
poets
expressed
such
lofty
sentiments
with
regard
to
women
anyone
who
thinks
this
does
not
know
dante
minor
poems
which
contain
to
women
in
the
flesh
and
above
all
to
one
of
them
the
most
wonderful
tributes
that
have
ever
been
paid
to
woman
take
this
one
of
his
sonnets
for
instance
so
gentle
and
so
fair
she
seems
to
be
my
lady
when
she
others
doth
salute
that
every

in

she

it

not
a

to
any
of

physical
perfections
or
indeed
to
any
of
those
charms
that
poets
usually
sing
we
have
already
called
attention
to
this
that
it
is
not
the
beauty
of
her
face
or
her
figure
that
has
attracted
him
but
the
charm
of
her
character
which
all
others
must
admire
which
even
women
do
not
envy
it
is
so
beautiful
that
constitutes
the
supreme
reason
for

admiration
nor
must
it
be
thought
that
this
is
a
unique
example
of

attitude
in

on
the
contrary
it
is
the
constant
type
of
his
expression

the

probably
quite
as
beautiful
as

while
the
thirteenth
century
was
engaged
in
solving
the
problems
of
the
higher
education
and
of
technical
education
for
the
masses
and
was
occupied
so
successfully
as
we
have
seen
with
the
questions
of
the
rights
of
man
and
the
development
of
law
and
of
liberty
other
and
more
directly
social
and
humanitarian
works
were
not
neglected
there
had
been
hospitals
in
existence
from
even
before
the
christian
era
but
they
had
been
intended
rather
for
the
chronic
ailments
and
as
the
name
implies
for
the
furnishing
of
hospitality
to
strangers
and
others
who
had
for
the
time
no
habitation
than
for
the
care
of
the
acutely
ill
in
the
country
places
there
was
a
larger
christian
charity
which
led
people
to
care
even
for
the
stranger
and
there
was
a
sense
of
human
duty
that
was
much
more
binding
than
in
the
modern
world
the
acutely
ill
were
not
infrequently
taken
into
the
houses
of
even
those
who
did
not
know
them
and
cared
for
with
a
solicitude
difficult
to
understand
in
this
colder
time
this
was
not
so
much
typical
of
the
times
however
as
of
the
social
conditions
since
we
have
many
stories
of
such
events
in
our
colonial
days
in
the
cities
however
which
began
more
and
more
to
be
a
feature
of
life
in
the
thirteenth
century
though
they
counted
their
inhabitants
only
by
a
few
thousands
where
ours
count
them
by
hundreds
of
thousands
the
need
of
some
other
method
of
caring
for
such
cases
made
itself
distinctly
felt
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
and
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
centuries
this
need
became
demandingly
manifest
and
the
consequence
was
a
movement
that
proved
to
be
of
great
and
practical
benevolence
it
is
to
the
first
pope
of
the
thirteenth
century
innocent
that
we
owe
the
modern
city
hospital
as
we
have
it
at
the
present
time
with
its
main
purpose
to
care
for
the
acutely
ill
who
may
have
no
one
to
take
care
of
them
properly
as
well
as
for
those
who
have
been
injured
or
who
have
been
picked
up
on
the
street
and
whose
friends
are
not
in
a
position
to
care
for
them
the
deliberateness
with
which
innocent
iii
set
about
the
establishment
of
the
mother
city
hospital
of
the
world
is
a
striking
characteristic
of
the
genius
of
the
man
and
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
practical
character
of
the
century
of
which
he
is
so
thoroughly
representative
pope
innocent
recognized
the
necessity
for
the
existence
of
a
city
hospital
in
rome
and
by
inquiry
determined
that
the
model
hospital
for
this
purpose
existed
down
at
montpelier
in
connection
with
the
famous
medical
school
of
the
university
there
montpelier
had
succeeded
to
the
heritage
of
the
distinguished
reputation
in
medical
matters
which
had
been
enjoyed
by
salernum
not
far
from
naples
during
the
ninth
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
have
always
been
recognized
as
possessing
a
climate
especially
suitable
for
invalids
and
with
the
diminution
of
the
influence
of
the
salernitan
school
a
transfer
of
its
prestige
to
montpelier
where
the
close
relationship
with
spain
had
given
the
medical
schools
the
advantage
of
intimate
contact
with
the
medicine
of
the
arabs
is
not
a
matter
of
surprise
at
montpelier
the
hospital
arrangements
made
by
guy
de
montpelier
were
especially
efficient
the
hospital
of
which
he
had
charge
was
under
the
care
of
the
members
of
the
order
of
the
holy
spirit
pope
innocent
summoned
guy
or
guido
as
he
was
known
after
this
to
rome
and
founded
for
him
the
hospital
of
the
holy
spirit
in
the
borgo
not
far
from
peter
where
it
still
exists
this
was
the
mother
and
model
hospital
for
the
world
visitors
to
rome
saw
it
and
could
not
fail
to
admire
its
great
humanitarian
work
bishops
from
all
over
the
world
on
their
official
visits
to
the
head
of
the
church
admired
the
policy
under
which
the
hospital
was
conducted
recognized
the
interest
of
the
pope
in
it
and
went
back
to
their
homes
to
organize
institutions
of
the
same
kind
how
many
of
these
were
established
in
various
parts
of
europe
is
hard
to
determine
virchow
in
his
history
of
the
foundations
of
the
german
hospitals
has
a
list
of
over
one
hundred
towns
in
germany
in
which
hospitals
of
the
holy
spirit
or
medical
institutions
modeled
on
this
hospital
at
rome
were
founded
many
of
these
towns
were
comparatively
small
most
of
them
contained
at
the
time
less
than
five
thousand
inhabitants
so
that
it
can
be
said
without
hesitation
that
practically
every
town
of
any
importance
at
least
in
germany
came
under
the
influence
of
this
great
philanthropic
hospital
movement
with
regard
to
other
countries
it
is
more
difficult
to
determine
the
number
of
places
in
which
such
institutions
were
established
as
both
france
and
italy
were
however
much
more
closely
in
touch
with
the
holy
see
at
this
time
it
would
be
surprising
if
they
had
not
been
affected
as
much
as
germany
by
the
pope
enthusiasm
in
the
matter
we
do
know
that
in
various
large
cities
as
in
florence
siena
paris
and
london
there
was
a
development
of
existing
hospitals
and
the
establishment
of
new
ones
that
points
to
a
distinct
community
of
interest
in
the
hospital
movement
at
paris
the
hotel
dieu
was
moved
from
the
petit
pont
where
it
had
been
to
its
present
situation
and
received
large
extensions
in
size
and
in
usefulness
it
was
at
this
time
particularly
that
it
received
donations
for
endowment
purposes
that
would
enable
it
to
be
a
number
of
bequests
of
property
the
rent
of
which
was
to
be
paid
to
the
hospital
were
made
and
the
details
of
some
of
these
bequests
have
an
interest
of
their
own
houses
were
not
numbered
at
this
time
but
were
distinguished
by
various
signs
usually
figures
of
different
kinds
that
formed
part
of
their
facade
the
hotel
dieu
acquired
the
houses
with
the
image
of
louis
with
the
sign
of
the
golden
lion
of
flanders
with
the
image
of
the
butterfly
with
the
group
of
the
three
monkeys
with
the
image
of
the
wolf
with
the
image
of
the
iron
lion
with
the
cross
of
gold
with
the
chimneys
etc
the
hotel
dieu
indeed
seems
to
have
become
practically
a
fully
endowed
institution
during
the
course
of
the
thirteenth
century
for
there
are
apparently
no
records
of
special
revenues
voted
by
the
city
or
the
king
though
there
are
such
records
with
regard
to
other
places
for
instance
the
hospital
of
louis
received
the
right
to
collect
a
special
tax
on
all
the
salt
that
came
into
the
city
in
england
the
hospital
movement
during
the
thirteenth
century
is
evidently
quite
as
active
as
in
germany
at
least
as
far
as
the
records
go
these
refer
mainly
to
london
and
show
that
the
influence
of
the
work
of
innocent
iii
and
his
enthusiasm
was
felt
in
the
english
capital
the
famous
bartholomew
hospital
in
london
had
been
a
priory
founded
at
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century
which
took
care
of
the
poor
and
the
ailing
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
became
more
frankly
a
hospital
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
word
thomas
hospital
which
remains
to
the
present
day
one
of
the
great
medical
institutions
of
london
was
founded
by
richard
prior
of
bermondsey
in
bethlehem
or
bedlam
which
afterwards
became
a
hospital
for
the
insane
was
founded
about
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
name
bedlam
is
a
corruption
of
bethlehem
since
adopted
into
the
english
language
to
express
a
place
where
fools
do
congregate
bridewell
and
christ
hospital
which
were
the
other
two
of
the
institutions
long
known
as
the
five
royal
hospitals
of
london
also
seem
either
to
have
been
founded
or
to
have
received
a
great
stimulus
and
reorganization
in
the
thirteenth
century
but
both
ceased
after
some
time
to
be
places
for
the
reception
of
the
ailing
and
became
one
of
them
a
prison
and
the
other
a
school
the
names
of
some
of
these
institutions
became
associated
with
that
of
edward
vi
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
for
this
however
there
was
no
proper
justification
since
at
most
all
that
was
accomplished
within
the
reign
of
the
boy
king
was
the
reestablishment
of
institutions
formerly
in
existence
which
had
been
confiscated
under
the
laws
of
henry
but
the
necessity
for
whose
existence
had
been
made
very
clear
because
of
the
suffering
entailed
upon
the
many
ailing
poor
by
the
fact
that
in
their
absence
there
was
nowhere
for
them
to
go
to
be
cared
for
as
gairdner
points
out
in
his
history
of
the
english
church
in
the
sixteenth
century
edward
has
left
a
name
in
connection
with
charities
and
education
which
critical
scholars
find
to
be
little
justified
by
fact
the
supposed
foundation
of
thomas
hospital
was
only
the
reestablishment
of
this
institution
and
even
when
it
was
granted
by
him
to
the
citizens
of
london
this
was
not
as
gairdner
says
without
their
paying
for
it
how
much
all
this
hospital
movement
owes
to
innocent
iii
will
be
best
appreciated
from
virchow
account
of
the
german
hospitals
the
great
german
scientist
not
being
one
of
those
at
all
likely
to
exaggerate
the
beneficent
influence
of
the
popes
he
says
the
main
cause
decisive
in
influencing
and
arousing
interest
of
the
people
of
the
time
in
the
hospitals
of
the
holy
ghost
was
the
papal
enthusiasm
in
the
matter
the
beginning
of
their
history
is
connected
with
the
name
of
that
pope
who
made
the
boldest
and
attempt
to
gather
the
sum
of
human
interest
into
the
organization
of
the
catholic
church
the
hospitals
of
the
holy
ghost
were
one
of
the
many
means
by
which
innocent
iii
thought
to
bind
humanity
to
the
holy
see
and
surely
it
was
one
of
the
most
effective
was
it
not
calculated
to
create
the
most
profound
impression
to
see
how
the
mighty
pope
who
humbled
emperors
and
deposed
kings
who
was
the
unrelenting
adversary
of
the
albigenses
turned
his
eyes
sympathetically
upon
the
poor
and
sick
sought
the
helpless
and
the
neglected
on
the
streets
and
saved
the
illegitimate
children
from
death
in
the
waters
there
is
something
conciliating
and
fascinating
in
the
fact
that
at
the
very
same
time
at
which
the
fourth
crusade
was
inaugurated
through
his
influence
the
thought
of
founding
a
great
organization
of
an
essentially
humane
character
to
extend
throughout
all
christendom
was
also
taking
form
in
his
soul
and
that
in
the
same
year
in
which
the
new
latin
empire
was
founded
in
constantinople
the
newly
erected
hospital
of
the
santo
spirito
by
the
old
bridge
across
the
tiber
was
blessed
and
dedicated
as
the
future
center
of
this
universal
humanitarian
organization

of

lübeck
virchow
of
course
considers
innocent
action
as
due
to
the
entirely
interested
motive
of
binding
the
catholic
world
to
the
holy
see
others
however
who
have
studied
innocent
life
even
more
profoundly
have
not
considered
his
purpose
as
due
to
any
such
mean
motive
hurter
who
wrote
a
history
of
pope
innocent
the
researches
for
which
he
began
as
a
protestant
with
the
idea
that
in
the
life
of
this
pope
better
than
anywhere
else
the
pretensions
of
the
papacy
could
be
most
effectively
exposed
but
who
was
so
taken
by
the
character
of
the
man
that
before
he
completed
his
history
he
had
become
a
catholic
looks
at
it
in
a
very
different
way
even
virchow
himself
quotes
hurter
opinion
though
not
without
taking
some
exceptions
to
it
hurter
said
with
regard
to
charitable
foundations
in
his
history

all

which
the
human
race
still
enjoys
all

the

every
stage
of
suffering
from
the
first
moment
of
birth
to
the
return
of
the
material
part
to
earth
have
had
their
origin
in
the
church
some
of
them
directly
some
of
them
indirectly
through
the
sentiments
and
feelings
which
she
aroused
strengthened
and
vivified
into
action
the
church
supplied
for
them
the
model
and
sometimes
even
the
resources
that
these
great
humanitarian
needs
were
not
neglected
and
their
remedies
not
lacking
in
any
respect
is
essentially
due
to
her
influence
upon
human
character
with
regard
to
this
virchow
says
that
hospitals
had
existed
among
the
arabs
and
among
the
buddhists
in
the
distant
east
nevertheless
he
adds
it
may
be
recognized
and
admitted
that
it
was
reserved
for
the
roman
catholic
church
and
above
all
for
innocent
to
establish
institutions
for
the
care
of
those
suffering
from
diseases
a
corresponding
hospital
movement
that
received
considerable
attention
within
the
thirteenth
century
was
the
erection
of
leproseries
or
hospitals
for
the
care
of
lepers
leprosy
had
become
quite
common
in
europe
during
the
middle
ages
and
the
contact
of
the
west
with
the
east
during
the
crusades
had
brought
about
a
notable
increase
of
the
disease
it
is
not
definitely
known
how
much
of
what
was
called
leprosy
at
that
time
really
belonged
to
the
specific
disease
now
known
as
lepra
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
affections
which
have
since
come
to
be
considered
as
quite
harmless
and
were
included
under
the
designation
leprosy
by
the
populace
and
even
by
physicians
incapable
as
yet
of
making
a
proper
differential
diagnosis
probably
severe
cases
of
eczema
and
other
chronic
skin
diseases
especially
when
complicated
by
the
results
of
wrongly
directed
treatment
or
of
lack
of
cleansing
were
sometimes
pronounced
to
be
leprosy
certain
of
the
severer
forms
of
what
is
now
known
as
psoriasis
a
skin
disease
running
a
very
slow
course
and
sometimes
extremely
obstinate
to
treatment
were
almost
surely
included
under
the
diagnosis
of
leprosy
personally
i
have
seen
in
the
general
hospital
in
vienna
a
patient
who
had
for
many
months
been
compelled
by
the
villagers
among
whom
he
lived
to
confine
himself
to
his
dwelling
sustained
by
food
that
was
thrown
into
him
at
the
window
by
the
neighbors
who
were
fearful
of
the
contagiousness
of
his
skin
disease
yet
he
was
suffering
from
only
a
very
neglected
case
of
psoriasis
there
is
no
doubt
however
of
the
existence
of
actual
leprosy
in
many
of
the
towns
of
the
west
from
the
twelfth
to
the
fifteenth
centuries
and
the
erection
of
these
special
hospitals
proved
the
best
possible
prophylactic
against
the
further
spread
of
the
disease
leprosy
is
contagious
but
only
mildly
so
years
of
association
with
lepers
may
and
usually
does
bring
about
the
communication
of
the
disease
to
those
around
them
especially
if
they
do
not
exercise
rather
carefully
certain
precise
precautions
as
to
cleanliness
after
personal
contact
or
after
the
handling
of
things
which
have
previously
been
in
the
leper
possession
as
the
result
of
the
existence
of
these
houses
of
segregation
leprosy
disappeared
during
the
course
of
the
next
three
centuries
and
thus
a
great
hygienic
triumph
was
obtained
by
sanitary
regulation
this
successful
hygienic
and
sanitary
work
which
brought
about
practically
the
complete
obliteration
of
leprosy
in
the
middle
ages
furnished
the
first
example
of
the
possibility
of
eradicating
a
disease
that
had
become
a
scourge
to
mankind
that
this
should
have
been
accomplished
by
a
movement
that
had
its
greatest
source
in
the
thirteenth
century
is
all
the
more
surprising
since
we
are
usually
accustomed
to
think
of
the
people
of
those
times
as
sadly
lacking
in
any
interest
in
sanitary
matters
the
significance
of
the
success
of
the
segregation
movement
was
lost
upon
men
down
almost
to
our
own
time
this
was
however
because
it
was
considered
that
most
of
the
epidemic
diseases
were
conveyed
by
the
air
they
were
thought
infectious
and
due
to
a
climatic
condition
rather
than
to
contagion
that
is
conveyed
by
actual
contact
with
the
person
having
the
disease
or
something
that
had
touched
him
which
is
the
view
now
held
with
the
beginning
of
the
crusade
against
tuberculosis
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
however
the
most
encouraging
factor
for
those
engaged
in
it
was
the
history
of
the
success
of
segregation
methods
and
careful
prevention
of
the
spread
of
the
disease
which
had
been
pursued
against
leprosy
in
a
word
the
lessons
in
sanitation
and
prophylaxis
of
the
thirteenth
century
are
only
now
bearing
fruit
because
the
intervening
centuries
did
not
have
sufficient
knowledge
to
realize
their
import
and
take
advantage
of
them
pope
innocent
iii
was
not
the
only
occupant
of
the
papal
throne
whose
name
deserves
to
be
remembered
with
benedictions
in
connection
with
the
hospital
movement
of
the
thirteenth
century
his
successors
took
up
the
work
of
encouragement
where
he
had
left
it
at
his
death
and
did
much
to
bring
about
the
successful
accomplishment
of
his
intentions
in
even
wider
spheres
honorius
iii
is
distinguished
by
having
made
into
an
order
the
antonine
congregation
of
vienna
which
was
especially
devoted
to
the
care
of
patients
suffering
from
the
holy
fire
and
from
various
mutilations
the
disease
known
as
the
holy
fire
seems
to
have
been
what
is
called
in
modern
times
erysipelas
during
the
middle
ages
it
received
various
titles
such
as
anthony
fire
fire
and
the
like
the
latter
part
of
the
designation
evidently
being
due
to
the
intense
redness
which
characterizes
the
disease
and
which
can
be
compared
to
nothing
better
than
the
erythema
consequent
upon
a
rather
severe
burn
this
affection
was
a
great
deal
commoner
in
the
middle
ages
than
in
later
times
though
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
its
disappearance
has
come
mainly
in
the
last
years
it
is
now
known
to
be
a
contagious
disease
and
indeed
as
oliver
wendell
holmes
pointed
out
over
half
a
century
ago
may
readily
be
carried
from
place
to
place
by
the
physician
in
attendance
it
does
not
always
manifest
itself
as
erysipelas
when
thus
carried
however
and
the
merit
of
holmes
work
was
in
pointing
out
the
fact
that
physicians
who
attended
patients
suffering
from
erysipelas
and
then
waited
on
obstetrical
cases
were
especially
likely
to
carry
the
infection
which
manifested
itself
as
puerperal
fever
a
number
of
cases
of
this
kind
were
reported
and
discussed
by
him
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
warning
served
to
save
many
precious
lives
of
course
nothing
was
known
of
this
in
the
thirteenth
century
yet
the
encouragement
given
to
this
religious
order
which
devoted
itself
practically
exclusively
to
the
care
in
special
hospitals
of
erysipelas
must
have
had
not
a
little
effect
in
bringing
about
a
limitation
of
the
spread
of
the
disease
in
such
hospitals
patients
were
not
likely
to
come
in
contact
with
many
persons
and
consequently
the
of
the
disease
was
limited
in
our
own
time
immediate
segregation
of
cases
when
discovered
has
practically
eradicated
it
so
that
many
a
young
physician
even
though
ten
years
in
practise
has
never
seen
a
case
of
it
it
was
so
common
in
america
during
the
civil
war
and
for
half
a
century
prior
thereto
that
there
were
frequent
epidemics
of
it
in
hospitals
and
it
was
generally
recognized
that
the
disease
was
so
contagious
that
when
it
once
gained
a
foothold
in
a
hospital
nearly
every
patient
suffering
from
an
open
wound
was
likely
to
be
affected
by
it
it
is
interesting
then
to
learn
that
these
people
of
the
middle
ages
attempted
to
control
the
disease
by
erecting
special
hospitals
for
it
though
unfortunately
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
know
just
how
much
was
accomplished
by
these
means
a
congregation
devoted
to
the
special
care
of
the
disease
had
been
organized
as
we
have
said
early
in
the
thirteenth
century
at
the
end
of
this
century
this
was
given
the
full
weight
of
his
amplest
approval
by
pope
boniface
who
conferred
on
it
the
privilege
of
having
priests
among
its
members
it
will
be
remembered
that
pope
boniface
viii
is
said
to
have
issued
the
bull
which
forbade
the
practise
of
dissection
the
decretal
in
question
however
which
was
not
a
bull
only
regulated
as
i
have
shown
the
abuse
which
had
sprung
up
of
dismembering
bodies
and
boiling
them
in
order
to
be
able
to
carry
them
to
a
distance
for
burial
and
was
in
itself
an
excellent
hygienic
measure
many
orders
for
the
care
of
special
needs
of
humanity
were
established
during
the
thirteenth
century
it
is
from
this
period
that
most
of
the
religious
habits
worn
by
women
originate
these
used
to
be
considered
rather
cumbersome
for
such
a
serious
work
as
the
nursing
and
care
of
the
sick
but
in
recent
years
quite
a
different
view
has
been
taken
the
covering
of
the
head
for
instance
and
the
shearing
of
the
hair
must
have
been
of
distinct
value
in
preventing
communication
of
certain
diseases
there
has
been
a
curious
assimilation
in
the
last
few
years
of
the
dress
required
to
be
worn
by
nurses
in
operating
rooms
to
that
worn
by
most
of
the
religious
communities
the
head
must
be
completely
covered
and
the
garments
worn
are
of
material
that
can
be
washed
it
will
be
recalled
that
the
headdresses
of
religious
being
as
a
rule
of
spotless
white
must
be
renewed
frequently
and
therefore
must
be
kept
in
a
condition
of
what
is
practically
surgical
cleanliness
while
this
was
not
at
all
the
intention
of
those
who
adopted
the
particular
style
of
headdress
worn
by
religious
yet
their
choice
has
proved
in
what
may
well
be
considered
a
providential
way
to
be
an
excellent
protective
for
the
patients
against
certain
dangers
that
would
inevitably
have
been
present
if
their
dress
had
been
the
ordinary
one
of
the
women
of
their
class
during
these
many
centuries
of
hospital
nursing
by
religious
women
the
organization
of
charity
is
supposed
to
be
a
feature
of
social
life
that
was
reserved
for
these
modern
times
a
subsequent
chapter
on
democracy
christian
socialism
and
national
patriotism
shows
how
false
this
notion
is
from
one
standpoint
a
little
additional
interpretation
will
show
that
the
generations
which
organized
the
hospitals
took
care
of
the
lepers
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
their
becoming
sources
of
infection
for
others
and
segregated
such
severe
contagious
diseases
as
erysipelas
not
only
knew
how
to
organize
charitable
efforts
but
were
able
to
accomplish
their
purposes
in
this
matter
in
such
a
way
that
the
friction
of
the
charity
organization
itself
absorbed
as
little
as
possible
of
the
beneficent
energy
put
into
it
and
much
less
than
is
the
case
in
our
own
time
besides
the
monasteries
were
really
active
centers
of
charity
organization
of
the
most
practical
character
they
not
only
gave
to
the
people
when
their
necessities
required
it
but
they
were
active
employers
of
labor
and
in
times
of
scarcity
constantly
made
large
sacrifices
in
order
to
keep
their
people
employed
and
even
the
community
itself
went
on
short
rations
in
order
that
the
suffering
in
the
neighborhood
might
not
be
extreme
in
times
of
prosperity
there
were
no
doubt
abuses
in
monasteries
but
no
one
ever
accused
them
of
neglecting
the
poor
during
times
of
famine
while
the
thirteenth
century
was
so
intent
upon
the
relief
of
the
social
needs
consequent
upon
illness
and
injury
it
did
not
neglect
other
forms
of
social
endeavor
one
of
the
crying
evils
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
the
fact
that
mariners
and
merchants
as
well
as
pilgrims
to
the
holy
land
were
not
infrequently
captured
by
corsairs
from
the
northern
coast
of
africa
and
sold
into
slavery
at
times
if
there
was
hope
of
a
very
large
ransom
news
of
the
condition
of
these
poor
victims
might
find
its
way
to
their
homes
as
a
rule
however
they
were
as
much
lost
to
family
and
friends
as
if
they
had
actually
been
swallowed
up
by
the
sea
which
was
usually
concluded
to
have
been
their
fate
the
hardships
thus
endured
and
the
utter
helplessness
of
their
conditions
made
them
fitting
subjects
for
special
social
effort
the
institution
which
was
to
provide
relief
for
this
sad
state
of
affairs
had
its
rise
in
a
typically
thirteenth
century
way
what
doubtless
the
modern
world
would
be
apt
to
think
of
as
characteristically
medieval
but
the
result
achieved
was
as
good
an
example
of
practical
benevolence
as
has
ever
been
effected

the
most
of

shortly
after
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
two
very
intelligent
men
whose
friends
honored
them
very
much
for
the
saintliness
of
their
lives
meaning
by
saintliness
not
only
their
piety
but
their
thoughtfulness
for
others
before
themselves
had
a
dream
in
which
they
saw
poor
captives
held
in
slavery
and
asking
for
some
one
out
of
christian
charity
to
come
and
ransom
them
one
of
these
men
was
john
of
matha
a
distinguished
teacher
of
theology
at
the
university
of
paris
the
other
was
felix
of
valois
more
distinguished
for
his
piety
than
his
learning
but
by
no
means
an
ignorant
man
on
the
same
night
though
living
at
a
distance
from
one
another
they
had
this
identical
dream
having
told
it
next
day
to
some
friends
it
happened
that
after
a
time
it
came
to
their
mutual
knowledge
that
the
other
had
had
a
similar
vision
the
circumstance
seemed
so
striking
to
them
that
they
applied
to
the
pope
for
an
interpretation
of
it
the
pope
who
was
innocent
the
founder
of
city
hospitals
saw
in
it
a
magnificent
opportunity
for
the
foundation
of
another
great
christian
charity
accordingly
in
interpreting
it
he
directed
their
thoughts
toward
the
redemption
of
christian
captives
taken
by
the
saracens
he
has
as
a
consequence
been
regarded
as
the
founder
of
the
order
of
trinitarians
and
did
in
fact
draft
its
rule
it
was
called
from
its
object
ordo
de
redemptione
captivorum
order
for
the
redemption
of
captives
but
its
members
were
more
generally
known
as
trinitarians
they
wore
a
white
habit
having
a
red
and
blue
cross
on
the
breast
they
were
well
received
in
france
where
they
had
originated
were
the
recipients
of
large
sums
of
money
to
be
devoted
to
the
objects
of
the
order
and
had
large
accessions
to
their
number
among
whom
were
many
distinguished
by
ability
and
profound
learning
in
the
year
the
first
company
of
ransomed
captives
arrived
from
morocco
and
one
may
easily
imagine
their
joy
on
again
regaining
their
freedom
and
beholding
once
more
their
friends
and
native
land
the
members
of
this
order
were
sometimes
called
mathurins
from
the
title
of
the
first
church
occupied
by
them
in
paris
they
spread
rapidly
in
southern
france
through
spain
italy
england
saxony
and
hungary
and
foundations
of
a
similar
kind
were
also
opened
for
women
cerfroid
in
the
diocese
of
meaux
where
the
first
house
of
the
order
was
opened
became
the
residence
of
the
general
minister
generalis
there
was
a
fine
field
for
their
labors
in
spain
where
the
moors
were
constantly
at
war
with
the
christians
the
spirit
of
these
religious
which
led
them
to
incur
almost
any
dangers
in
the
accomplishment
of
their
purpose
was
only
equaled
by
their
zeal
in
arousing
interest
for
the
poor
captives
they
became
the
accredited
agents
for
the
ransoming
of
prisoners
and
also
for
their
exchange
and
even
the
mahometans
learned
to
trust
and
eventually
to
reverence
them
when
they
could
not
ransom
at
once
they
thus
succeeded
in
ameliorating
the
conditions
in
which
slave
prisoners
were
kept
and
proved
a
great
source
of
consolation
to
them
another
order

the
same
object
in
view

differing

special
protection

the
blessed
virgin

called
the
order

themselves
by

to
give

their
devotion
was
so
ardent
that
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
purpose
they
vowed
if
necessary
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
their
very
persons
as
peter
actually
did
in
africa
for
the
redemption
of
christian
captives
hence
their
members
were
divided
into
knights
who
wore
a
white
uniform
and
brothers
who
took
orders
and
provided
for
the
spiritual
wants

the

the

great
origins
in
law
perhaps
the
most
surprising
phase
of
thirteenth
century
history
is
that
much
of
what
is
most
valued
and
most
valuable
in
our
modern
laws
especially
as
they
concern
the
fundamental
rights
of
man
is
to
be
found
clearly
expressed
in
the
great
lawmaking
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
can
scarcely
fail
to
astonish
those
who
look
upon
the
middle
ages
as
hopelessly
barren
in
progress
to
find
that
human
liberty
in
its
development
reached
such
a
pass
before
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
or
that
any
period
so
long
before
the
renaissance
and
the
reformation
could
be
picked
out
as
representing
a
distinctive
epoch
in
supremely
liberal
legislation
after
careful
study
the
surprise
is
apt
to
be
rather
that
there
should
have
been
comparatively
so
little
advance
since
that
time
seeing
how
much
the
generations
of
this
marvelous
century
were
able
to
accomplish
in
definitely
formulating
principles
of
human
rights
the
first
great
document
in
the
laws
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
of
course
magna
charta
signed
in
the
foundation
of
all
the
liberties
of
english
speaking
people
ever
since
perhaps
the
highest
possible
tribute
to
the
great
charter
is
the
fact
that
it
has
grown
in
the
estimation
of
intelligent
men
rather
than
lost
significance
in
quite
recent
years
it
has
become
somewhat
the
custom
to
belittle
its
import
and
its
influence
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
over
and
over
again
in
times
of
national
crises
in
england
magna
charta
has
been
confidently
appealed
to
as
a
fundamental

too
sacred

magic

of
averting
national
calamity
bishop
stubbs
said
of
it
that
the
great
charter
was
the
first
supreme
act
of
the
nation
after
it
had
realized
its
own
identity
perhaps
in
nothing
does
its
supremacy
as
basic
legislation
for
national
purposes
so
shine
forth
as
from
the
fact
that
it
is
not
a
vague
statement
of
great
principles
not
a
mere
declaration
of
human
rights
not
a
documentary
rehearsal
of
fundamental
legalities
but
a
carefully
collected
series
of
practical
declarations
for
the
solution
of
the
problems
that
were
then
disturbing
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
and
leading
to
charge
and
countercharge
of
infringement
of
right
on
the
part
of
the
king
and
his
subjects
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
men
of
the
thirteenth
century
from
the
generations
who
more
than
any
other
in
all
human
history
succeeded
in
uniting
the
useful
with
the
beautiful
in
everything
from
the
decoration
of
their
churches
and
other
great
architectural
structures
to
the
ordinary
objects
of
everyday
life
it
was
of
eminently
practical
character
while
it
is
the
custom
to
talk
much
of
magna
charta
and
to
praise
its
wonderful
influence
there
are
very
few
people
who
have
ever
actually
read
its
provisions
the
classics
are
said
to
be
books
that
everyone
praises
but
no
one
reads
and
magna
charta
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
documents
that
are
joined
in
the
same
fate
a
little
consideration
of
some
of
the
chapters
of
the
charter
will
give
an
excellent
idea
of
its
thoroughly
straightforward
practicalness
though
it
may
serve
also
to
undeceive
those
who
would
expect
to
find
in
this
primal
document
a
lofty
statement
of
abstract
human
rights
such
as
the
men
of
the
thirteenth
century
were
never
conscious
of
since
their
thoughts
were
always
in
the
concrete
and
their
efforts
were
bent
to
the
solution
of
the
problems
lying
just
before
them
and
not
to
the
lifting
of
all
the
burdens
that
human
nature
has
to
bear
before
this
of
course
there
had
been
some
development
of
legislation
to
furnish
the
basis
for
what
was
to
come
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
famous
constitutions
of
clarendon
under
henry
ii
and
the
assizes
of
clarendon
quite
a
different
matter
and
of
north
hampton
and
the
forest
under
henry
gave
assurances
of
rights
that
had
only
existed
somewhat
shadily
before
according
to
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
sworn
men
gave
their
verdict
in
cases
from
their
own
knowledge
this
was
of
course
quite
a
different
matter
from
the
giving
of
a
verdict
from
knowledge
obtained
through
witnesses
at
a
trial
but
the
germ
of
the
jury
trial
can
be
seen
it
was
not
however
until
the
next
reign
that
the
men
of
england
did
not
merely
wait
for
the
free
gifts
of
legal
rights
but
demanded
and
obtained
them
there
was
a
new
hitherto
spirit
abroad
in
the
thirteenth
century
by
which
men
dared
to
ask
for
the
rights
they
considered
should
be
theirs
the
opening
chapter
of
magna
charta
states
especially
the
subjects
of
the
rights
that
are
guaranteed
by
the
document
it
is
not
surprising
then
to
find
that
the
first
subject
is
the
church
and
that
the
most
extensive
guarantees
are
made
that
the
english
church
liberties
shall
be
inviolate
churchmen
had
been
largely
concerned
in
the
movement
which
secured
the
signing
of
magna
charta
and
then
after
all
as
must
never
be
forgotten
the
church
at
this
time
was
distinctly
felt
by
all
to
be
the
spiritual
expression
of
the
religious
aspirations
of
the
people
over
the
concluding
sentence
of
this
chapter
the
grant
of
the
unwritten
liberties
to
all
freemen
of
our
kingdom
there
has
been
no
little
discussion
there
are
some
who
would
consider
that
it
applied
to
all
englishmen
above
the
condition
of
villeins
or
serfs
while
there
are
others
who
would
limit
its
application
practically
to
those
nobly
born
in
the
kingdom
posterity
undoubtedly
came
to
translate
it
in
the
broader
sense
so
that
whatever
the
original
intention
the
phrase
became
as
a
grant
eventually
to
all
free
englishmen
chapter
in
the
first
place
we
have
granted
to
god
and
by
this
our
present
charter
confirmed
for
us
and
our
heirs
for
ever
that
the
english
church
shall
be
free
and
shall
have
her
rights
entire
and
her
liberties
inviolate
and
we
will
that
it
be
thus
observed
which
is
apparent
from
this
that
the
freedom
of
elections
which
is
reckoned
most
important
and
very
essential
to
the
english
church
we
of
our
pure
and
unconstrained
will
did
grant
and
by
our
charter
confirm
and
did
obtain
the
ratification
of
the
same
from
our
lord
pope
innocent
iii
before
the
quarrel
arose
between
us
and
our
barons
and
this
we
will
observe
and
our
will
is
that
it
be
observed
in
good
faith
by
our
heirs
for
ever
we
have
also
granted
to
all
freemen
of
our
kingdom
for
us
and
for
our
heirs
for
ever
all
the
underwritten
liberties
to
be
had
and
held
by
them
and
their
heirs
of
us
and
our
heirs
for
ever
perhaps
the
most
interesting
feature
of
magna
charta
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
it
did
actually
in
most
cases
come
to
be
applied
ever
so
much
wider
than
had
apparently
been
the
original
intention
it
was
in
this
sense
a
vital
document
as
it
were
since
it
had
within
itself
the
power
of
developing
so
as
to
suit
the
varying
circumstances
for
which
recourse
was
had
to
it
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
of
the
good
faith
of
the
men
who
appealed
to
it
nor
of
their
firm
persuasion
that
the
document
actually
intended
what
they
claimed
to
find
in
it
modern
criticism
has
succeeded
in
stripping
from
the
original
expressions
many
of
the
added
meanings
that
posterity
attached
to
them
but
in
so
doing
has
really
not
lessened
the
estimation
in
which
magna
charta
must
be
held
the
position
is
indeed
noteworthily
analagous
to
that
of
the
original
deposit
of
faith
and
the
development
of
doctrine
which
has
taken
place
higher
criticism
has
done
much
to
show
how
little
of
certain
modern
ideas
was
apparently
contained
explicitly
in
the
original
formulas
of
christian
faith
and
yet
by
so
doing
has
not
lessened
our
beliefs
but
has
rather
tended
to
make
us
realize
the
vitality
of
the
original
christian
tenets
as
everything
living
in
god
creation
they
have
developed
by
a
principle
implanted
within
them
to
suit
the
evolutionary
conditions
of
man
intelligence
and
the
developing
problems
that
they
were
supposed
to
offer
solutions
for
the
comparison
of
course
like
all
comparisons
must
walk
a
little
lame
since
after
all
magna
charta
is
a
human
document
and
yet
the
very
fact
that
it
should
have
presented
itself
under
so
many
varying
conditions
ever
with
new
significance
to
succeeding
generations
of
thinking
men
is
the
best
evidence
of
how
nearly
man
work
at
its
best
may
approach
that
of
the
creator
it
is
an
exemplification
in
a
word
of
the
creative
genius
of
the
century
a
worthy
compeer
of
the
other
accomplishments
which
have
proved
so
enduring
and
so
capable
of
making
their
influence
felt
even
upon
distant
generations
it
is
of
the
very
essence
of
the
practicality
of
magna
charta
that
among
the
early
chapters
of
the
important
document
chapter
is
one
that
concerns
widows
and
their
property
rights
immediately
after
the
death
of
their
husbands
previous
chapters
had
discussed
questions
of
guardianship
and
inheritance
since
it
was
especially
minors
who
in
this
rude
period
were
likely
to
suffer
from
the
injustice
of
the
crown
of
their
in
the
nobility
and
even
from
their
guardians
while
magna
charta
then
begins
with
the
principles
for
the
regulation
of
matters
of
property
as
regards
children
it
proceeds
at
once
to
the
next
class
most
liable
to
injustice
because
of
their
inability
to
properly
defend
themselves
by
force
of
arms
the
widows
chapter
vii
a
widow
after
the
death
of
her
husband
shall
forthwith
and
without
difficulty
have
her
marriage
portion
and
inheritance
nor
shall
she
give
anything
for
her
dower
or
for
her
marriage
portion
or
for
the
inheritance
which
she
and
her
husband
held
on
the
day
of
the
death
of
that
husband
and
she
may
remain
in
the
house
of
her
husband
for
forty
days
after
his
death
within
which
time
her
dower
shall
be
assigned
to
her
chapter
viii
let
no
widow
be
compelled
to
marry
so
long
as
she
prefers
to
live
without
a
husband
provided
always
that
she
gives
security
not
to
marry
without
our
consent
if
she
holds
of
us
or
without
the
consent
of
the
lord
of
whom
she
holds
if
she
holds
of
another
the
first
of
these
provisions
serves
to
show
very
well
how
early
in
the
history
of
english
jurisprudence
a
thoroughgoing
respect
for
woman
legal
rights
began
to
have
a
place
the
beginning
thirteenth
century
made
an
excellent
start
in
their
favor
for
some
reason
the
movement
for
justice
thus
initiated
did
not
continue
but
suffered
a
sad
interruption
down
almost
to
our
own
times
the
second
of
these
provisions
for
widows
embodied
in
chapter
sounds
a
little
queer
to
the
modern
ear
this
protection
of
widows
from
compulsion
to
marry
is
apt
to
seem
absolutely
unnecessary
in
these
modern
days
some
of
the
unmarried
are
indeed
prone
to
think
perhaps
that
widows
have
more
than
their
due
opportunity
in
this
matter
without
any
necessity
for
protecting
them
from
compulsion
of
course
it
is
to
be
understood
that
it
was
not
always
so
much
the
charms
of
the
lady
herself
that
must
be
protected
from
compulsion
as
those
of
the
property
which
she
inherited
and
the
political
and
martial
influence
that
she
might
be
expected
to
bring
her
husband
in
these
troublous
times
when
disputes
with
appeals
to
arms
were
extremely
frequent
it
was
important
to
have
the
regulation
that
after
the
death
of
a
husband
there
should
be
no
sudden
unbalancing
of
political
power
because
of
the
compelled
marriage
of
the
widow
of
some
powerful
noble
in
certain
subsequent
chapters
up
to
the
twelfth
there
is
question
mainly
of
the
rights
of
the
jews
as
to
collect
their
debts
with
interest
after
the
death
of
the
principal
to
whom
it
was
loaned
for
instance
according
to
chapter
the
debt
shall
not
bear
interest
while
the
heir
is
under
age
and
if
the
debt
fell
to
the
hands
of
the
crown
nothing
but
the
principal
was
to
be
taken
in
chapter
xi
if
any
one
died
indebted
to
the
jews
his
wife
should
have
her
dower
and
pay
nothing
of
that
debt
for
children
under
age
the
same
principle
held
and
they
had
a
right
to
the
provision
of
necessaries
in
keeping
with
the
condition
of
their
father
this
last
clause
has
been
perpetuated
in
the
practice
of
our
courts
as
some
consider
even
to
the
extent
of
an
abuse
so
that
debtors
can
not
collect
from
the
income
of
a
young
man
to
whom
money
has
been
left
if
by
so
doing
the
income
should
be
impaired
to
such
an
extent
as
to
make
his
method
of
living
unsuitable
to
the
condition
in
life
to
which
he
was
born
and
brought
up
chapter
xii
has
been
the
subject
of
more
discussion
perhaps
than
any
other
mckechnie
the
most
recent
commentator
on
magna
charta
says
of
it
footnote
footnote
magna
carta
a
commentary
on
the
great
charter
of
king
john
with
an
historical
introduction
by
william
sharp
mckechnie
phil
glasgow
james
maclehose
and
sons
publishers
to
the
university
this
is
a
famous
clause
greatly
valued
at
the
time
it
was
framed
because
of
its
precise
terms
and
narrow
scope
which
made
evasion
difficult
and
even
more
highly
valued
in
after
days
for
exactly
opposite
reasons
it
came
indeed
to
be
interpreted
in
a
broad
general
sense
by
enthusiasts
who
with
the
british
constitution
before
them
read
the
clause
as
enunciating
the
modern
doctrine
that
the
crown
can
impose
no
financial
burden
whatsoever
on
the
people
without
consent
of
parliament
readers
may
judge
for
themselves
from
the
tenor
of
the
chapter
how
wide
a
latitude
in
interpretation
it
not
only
permits
but
invites
chapter
xii
no
scutage
nor
aid
shall
be
imposed
in
our
kingdom
unless
by
common
counsel
of
our
kingdom
except
for
ransoming
our
person
for
making
our
eldest
son
a
knight
and
for
once
marrying
our
eldest
daughter
and
for
these
there
shall
not
be
levied
more
than
a
reasonable
aid
in
like
manner
it
shall
be
done
concerning
aids
from
the
citizens
of
london
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
hard
to
read
in
this
chapter
all
that
has
been
found
in
it
by
enthusiastic
appellants
to
magna
charta
at
many
times
during
the
succeeding
centuries
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
within
half
a
century
after
it
had
been
promulgated
it
was
appealed
to
confidently
as
one
of
the
reasons
why
an
english
parliament
should
meet
if
the
king
required
special
levies
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
war
it
was
during
the
sixth
and
seventh
decades
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
the
great
principle
of
english
legislation
there
shall
be
no
taxation
without
representation
which
six
centuries
later
was
to
be
appealed
to
by
the
american
colonies
as
the
justification
for
their
war
for
independence
gradually
came
to
be
considered
as
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
people
that
it
had
its
origin
in
magna
charta
there
seems
no
doubt
and
it
is
only
another
example
of
that
unconscious
development
of
a
vital
principle
which
as
we
know
from
history
took
place
so
often
with
regard
to
chapters
of
the
great
charter
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
important
chapters
of
magna
charta
is
the
very
brief
one
no
which
concerns
itself
with
the
holding
of
a
court
of
common
pleas
the
whole
of
the
chapter
is
common
pleas
shall
not
follow
our
court
but
shall
be
held
in
some
fixed
place
this
represented
a
distinct
step
in
advance
in
the
dispensing
of
justice
it
is
a
little
bit
hard
for
us
to
understand
but
all
departments
of
government
were
originally
centered
in
the
king
and
his
household
the
court
which
attended
to
royal
and
national
business
of
every
kind
as
pointed
out
by
mckechnie
in
his
magna
charta
the
court
united
in
itself
the
functions
of
the
modern
cabinet
of
the
administrative
department
the
home
office
the
foreign
office
and
the
admiralty
and
of
the
various
legal
tribunals
it
was
the
parent
of
the
court
at
james
and
the
courts
at
westminster
almost
needless
to
say
it
is
from
the
fact
that
the
dispensing
of
justice
was
a
function
of
royalty
that
the
places
of
holding
trials
are
still
called
courts
according
to
this
chapter
of
magna
charta
thereafter
ordinary
trials
common
pleas
did
not
have
to
follow
the
court
that
is
the
royal
household
in
its
wanderings
through
various
parts
of
the
kingdom
but
they
were
held
at
an
appointed
place
in
the
days
of
henry
ii
the
entire
machinery
of
royal
justice
had
to
follow
the
monarch
as
he
passed
sometimes
on
the
mere
impulse
of
the
moment
from
one
of
his
favorite
to
another
crowds
thronged
after
him
in
hot
pursuit
since
it
was
difficult
to
transact
business
of
moment
before
the
court
without
being
actually
present
this
entailed
almost
intolerable
delay
extreme
annoyance
and
great
expense
upon
litigants
who
brought
their
pleas
for
the
king
decision
there
is
an
account
of
the
hardships
which
this
system
inflicted
upon
suitors
told
of
one
celebrated
case
richard
gives
a
graphic
record
of
his
journeyings
in
search
of
justice
throughout
a
period
of
five
years
during
which
he
visited
in
the
king
wake
most
parts
of
england
normandy
aquitaine
and
anjou
ultimately
successful
he
paid
dearly
for
his
legal
triumph
he
had
to
borrow
at
a
ruinous
rate
of
interest
in
order
to
meet
his
enormous
expenses
mostly
for
traveling
and
was
scarcely
able
to
discharge
his
debts
all
litigation
then
that
did
not
directly
involve
the
crown
or
criminal
procedures
could
be
tried
thereafter
by
a
set
of
judges
who
sat
permanently
in
some
fixed
spot
which
though

this
last

business

might
be
thought
but
had
in
king
john

come
to
signify
criminal
trials
of
all
kinds
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
those
accused
of
crime
would
look
confidently
for
justice
to
the
representative
of
the
central
government
while
they
dreaded
the
jurisdiction
of
the
less
responsible
officials
resident
in
the
counties
who
had
a
reputation
for
cruelty
and
oppression
and
for
a
venality
that
it
was
hard
to
suppress
it
would
seem
as
though
these
quotations
would
serve
to
make
even
the
casual
reader
appreciate
how
thoroughly
magna
charta
deserves
the
reputation
which
it
has
borne
now
for
nearly
seven
centuries
of
an
extremely
valuable
fundamental
document
in
the
history
of
the
liberties
of
the
english
speaking
people
some
of
the
subsequent
chapters
may
be
quoted
without
comment
because
they
show
with
what
careful
attention
to
detail
the
rights
of
the
people
were
guaranteed
by
the
charter
and
how
many
apparently
trivial
things
were
considered
worthy
of
mention
we
may
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
chapters
and
there
are
definite
expressions
of
guarantee
for
the
rights
even
of
aliens
which
represent
a
great
advance
over
the
feelings
in
this
respect
that
had
animated
the
people
of
a
century
or
so
before
and

development
of

after

for
this
purpose
only
and
after
having
been
sworn
moreover
all
the
aforesaid
customs
and

the
observance
of
which
we
have
granted
in

as

the

aforesaid
and

pandulf
as
evidence
of
this

of

provisions
show
how
closely
the
church
was
bound
up
with
the
securing
and
maintenance
of
the
rights
of
the
english
people
the
clauses
we
have
quoted
just
before
need
no
comment
to
show
how
sturdily
the
spirit
of
liberty
strode
abroad
even
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
for
magna
charta
was
signed
in
the
rest
of
the
century
was
to
see
great
advances
in
liberty
and
human
rights
even
beyond
the
guarantees
of
the
great
charter
magna
charta
glorious
as
it
was
was
only
the
beginning
of
that
basic
legislation
which
was
to
distinguish
the
thirteenth
century
in
england
about
the
middle
of
the
century
bracton
began
his
collection
of
the
laws
of
the
land
which
has
since
been
the
great
english
classic
of
the
common
law
his
work
was
accomplished
while
he
was
the
chief
justiciary
during
the
reign
of
henry
iii
for
many
years
before
he
had
occupied
various
judicial
positions
as
justice
itinerant
of
the
counties
of
nottingham
and
derby
and
for
seventeen
years
his
name
appears
as
one
of
the
justices
of
the
aula
regis
this
experience
put
him
in
an
eminently
fitting
position
to
be
the
mouthpiece
of
english
practice
and
law
applications
and
his
book
was
at
once
accepted
as
an
authority
it
is
a
most
comprehensive
and
systematic
work
in
five
volumes
bearing
the
title
de
legibus
et
consuetudinibus
angliae
and
was
modeled
after
the
institutes
of
justinian
it
was
during
the
reign
of
edward
the
english
justinian
as
he
has
been
called
that
the
english
common
law
came
to
its
supreme
expression
and
this
monarch
has
rightly
been
placed
among
the
great
benefactors
of
mankind
for
his
magnanimous
generosity
in
securing
the
legal
rights
of
his
subjects
and
framing
english
liberties
for
all
time
not
a
little
of
edward
greatness
as
a
and
his
readiness
to
recognize
the
rights
of
his
subjects
with
his
consequent
willingness
to
have
english
law
arranged
and
published
must
be
attributed
to
his
connection
during
his
earlier
years
as
prince
of
wales
with
the
famous
simon
de
montfort
to
this
man
more
than
to
any
other
the
english
speaking
people
owe
the
development
of
those
constitutional
rights
which
gradually
came
to
be
considered
inalienably
theirs
during
the
thirteenth
century
he
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
very
great
characters
of
history
and
the
thirteenth
century
is
by
so
much
greater
for
having
been
the
scene
of
his
labors
during
so
many
years
for
the
establishment
of
constitutional
limitations
to
the
power
of
the
monarch
and
the
uplifting
of
the
rights
of
subjects
not
only
among
the
nobility
but
also
among
the
lower
classes
it
was
in
edward
time
that
the
english
common
law
was
fashioned
into
the
shape
in
which
it
was
to
exist
for
many
centuries
afterwards
how
true
this
is
may
perhaps
best
be
judged
by
the
fact
that
even
the
laws
with
regard
to
real
estate
have
not
been
changed
in
essence
since
that
time
though
medieval
titles
to
land
would
seem
to
be
so
different
to
those
of
the
present
day
according
to
the
encyclopedia
britannica
the
changes
which
have
been
made
since
that
time
have
been
mainly
due
to
the
action
of
equity
and
legislation
the
latter
sometimes
interpreted
by
the
courts
in
a
manner
very
different
from
the
intention
of
parliament
the
same
authority
is
responsible
for
the
statement
that
the
reign
of
edward
is
notable
for
three
leading
real
estate
statutes
which
are
still
law
one
of
these
was
with
regard
to
mortmain
while
the
important
statute
known
as
the
eighteenth
of
chapter
of
the
laws
of
edward
i
had
the
practical
effect
of
making
the
transfer
of
land
thenceforward
more
of
a
commercial
and
less
of
a
legal
transaction
it
is
to
this
same
period
that
is
owed
the
writ
which
introduced
the
law
practice
of
a
creditor
remedy
over
real
estate
how
little
was
accomplished
in
the
matter
of
in
subsequent
centuries
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
james
williams
who
writes
the
article
on
real
estate
in
the
encyclopedia
britannica
ninth
edition
says
that
from
to
the
reign
of
henry
that
is
down
to
the
sixteenth
century
there
is
no
statute
of
the
first
importance
dealing
with
real
estate
in
a
word
then
it
may
be
said
that
these
of
the
thirteenth
century
anticipated
most
of
the
legal
difficulties
of
the
their
statutory
provisions
as
in
the
case
of
the
chapters
of
magna
charta
seemed
originally
only
to
have
a
narrow
application
to
certain
urgent
legal
questions
of
the
time
but
proved
eventually
to
contain
in
themselves
the
essence
of
legal
principles
that
could
be
applied
in
circumstances
such
as
the
original
had
not
even
imagined
this
is
indeed
the
typical
triumph
of
the
century
in
every
line
of
endeavor
that
while
apparently
it
devoted
itself
only
to
the
narrow
problems
of
its
own
time
its
solutions
of
them
whether
in
art
and
architecture
or
decoration
in
literary
expression
or
poetic
effectiveness
in
educational
methods
or
social
uplift
always
proved
so
complete
so
thoroughly
human
in
the
broadest
sense
of
that
word
and
so
consonant
with
development
that
their
work
did
not
have
to
be
done
over
again
no
greater
praise
than
this
could
be
bestowed

it
must
not
be
thought
because
we
have
devoted
so
much
time
to
the
triumphs
of
english
in
the
thirteenth
century
that
therefore
there
is
little
or
nothing
to
be
said
about
this
same
admirable
feature
of
the

louis
chose
stephen
boileau
to
act
as
chief
justice
and
committed
the
care
of
proper
legal
enforcement
with
confidence
into
his
hands
boileau
had
become
famous
by
having
condemned
some
very
near
relatives
under
circumstances
such
that
relationship
might
have
been
expected
to
weigh
down
the
wrong
side
of
the
scales
of
justice
and
in
a
few
years
he
enhanced
his
reputation
by
the
utter
disregard
of
all
motives
in
the
settlement
of
suits
at
law
except
those
of
the
strictest
justice
how
much
louis
himself
did
in
order
to
safeguard
the
rights
of
the
poor
can
be
judged
from
the
famous
incident
told
by
all
his
biographers
in
which
he
risked
the
enmity
of
the
most
powerful
among
his
barons
in
order
to
secure
the
punishment
of
one
of
them
who
had
put
two
students
to
death
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
rights
of
men
as
men
were
asserted
and
it
constitutes
the
best
possible
testimony
to
the
development
of
law
and
true
liberty
in
france
three
young
nobles
of
the
county
of
flanders
were
surprised
together
with
the
abbot
of
nicholas
in
a
wood
pertaining
to
coucy
with
bows
and
arrows
although
they
had
neither
dogs
nor
hunting
implements
they
were
found
guilty
of
having
gone
out
to
hunt
and
were
hanged
the
abbot
and
several
women
of
their
families
made
complaint
to
the
king
and
enguerrard
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
louvre
the
king
summoned
him
before
him
he
appeared
having
with
him
the
king
of
navarre
the
king
of
burgundy
the
counts
of
bar
soissons
brittany
and
blois
the
archbishop
of
rheims
sire
john
of
thorote
and
nearly
all
the
great
men
in
the
kingdom
the
accused
said
that
he
wished
to
take
counsel
and
he
retired
with
most
of
the
seigneurs
who
had
accompanied
him
leaving
the
king
alone
with
his
household
when
he
returned
john
of
thorote
in
his
name
said
that
he
would
not
submit
to
this
inquiry
since
his
person
his
honour
and
his
heritage
were
at
stake
but
that
he
was
ready
to
do
battle
denying
that
he
had
hanged
the
three
young
men
or
ordered
them
to
be
hanged
his
only
opponents
were
the
abbot
and
the
women
who
were
there
to
ask
for
justice
the
king
answered
that
in
causes
in
which
the
poor
the
churches
and
persons
worthy
of
pity
took
part
it
was
not
fitting
to
decide
them
in
battle
for
it
was
not
easy
to
find
anyone
to
fight
for
such
sorts
of
people
against
the
barons
of
the
kingdom
he
said
that
his
action
against
the
accused
was
no
new
thing
and
he
alleged
the
example
of
his
predecessor
philip
augustus
he
therefore
agreed
to
the
request
of
the
complainants
and
caused
enguerrard
to
be
arrested
by
the
sergeants
and
taken
to
the
louvre
all
prayers
were
useless
louis
refused
to
hear
them
rose
from
his
seat
and
the
barons
went
away
astonished
and
confused
they
did
not
however
consider
that
they
were
beaten
they
again
came
together
the
king
of
navarre
the
count
of
brittany
and
with
them
the
countess
of
flanders
who
ought
rather
to
have
intervened
for
the
victims
it
was
as
if
they
had
conspired
against
the
power
and
honour
for
they
were
not
content
to
implore
release
but
asserted
that
he
could
not
be
kept
in
prison
the
count
of
brittany
maintained
that
the
king
had
no
right
to
institute
inquiries
against
the
barons
of
his
kingdom
in
matters
which
concerned
their
persons
their
heritage
or
their
honour
the
king
replied
did
not
speak
thus
in
former
times
when
the
barons
in
direct
dependence
upon
you
came
before
me
with
complaints
against
yourself
and
offered
to
sustain
them
in
battle
you
then
said
that
to
do
battle
was
not
in
the
way
of
justice
the
barons
put
forward
a
final
argument
namely
that
according
to
the
customs
of
the
kingdom
the
king
could
only
judge
the
accused
and
punish
him
in
person
after
an
inquiry
to
which
he
had
refused
to
submit
the
king
was
resolute
and
declared
that
neither
the
rank
of
the
guilty
man
nor
the
power
of
his
friends
should
prevent
him
from
doing
full
justice
coucy
life
was
however
spared
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
present
at
the
judgment
nor
at
the
execution
prevailed
in
his
favour
by
the
advice
of
his
counsellors
the
king
condemned
him
to
pay
livres
parisis
which
considering
the
difference
in
the
purchasing
power
of
money
may
be
estimated
at
considerably
more
than
pounds
and
he
sent
this
sum
to
john
of
acre
for
the
defense
of
palestine
the
wood
in
which
the
young
men
were
hanged
was
confiscated
to
the
abbey
of
nicholas
the
condemned
man
was
also
constrained
to
found
three
perpetual
chapelries
for
the
souls
of
his
victims
and
he
forfeited
jurisdiction
over
his
woods
and
fish
ponds
so
that
he
was
forbidden
to
imprison
or
execute
for
any
offense
which
had
to
do
with
them
since
enguerrard
defender
john
of
thorote
had
in
his
anger
told
the
barons
that
the
king
would
do
well
to
hang
them
all
the
king
who
had
been
told
of
this
sent
for
him
and
said
comes
it
john
that
you
have
said
i
should
hang
my
barons
i
certainly
will
not
have
them
hanged
but
i
will
punish
them
when
they
do
amiss
john
of
thorote
denied
that
he
had
said
this
and
offered
to
justify
himself
on
the
oath
of
twenty
or
thirty
knights
the
king
would
not
carry
the
matter
further
and
let
him
go
one
of
the
best
evidences
of
the
development
of
the
spirit
of
law
in
germany
during
this
time
is
the
establishment
of
the
famous
fehmic
courts
or
vehmgerichte
which
achieved
their
highest
importance
during
the
thirteenth
century
as
with
regard
to
the
universities
there
is
a
tradition
that
carries
the
origin
of
these
courts
back
to
the
time
of
charlemagne
they
are
much
more
likely
to
have
been
developments
out
of
the
relics
of
the
ancient
free
courts
of
the
old
teutonic
tribe
the
first
definite
knowledge
of
their
existence
can
not
be
traced
much
earlier
than
a
decade
or
two
before
the
thirteenth
century
they
had
their
principal
existence
in
westphalia
practically
the
whole
country
between
the
rhine
and
the
weser
was
ruled
to
a
subordinate
degree
by
these
fehmic
courts
during
the
thirteenth
century
they
were
used
only
in
the
most
beneficial
and
liberal
spirit
supplying
a
means
of
redress
at
a
time
when
the
public
administration
of
justice
was
almost
completely
in
abeyance
as
a
matter
of
fact
before
their
establishment
disregard
for
authority
to
the
extent
of
utter
lawlessness
prevailed
in
this
part
of
germany
illustration
city
gate
neubrandenburg
illustration
rathhaus
stralsund
the
significance
of
these
courts
has
sometimes
been
missed
they
arose
however
out
of
the
justice
loving
spirit
of
the
people
themselves
and
were
meant
to
supply
legal
enforcements
when
the
regularly
constituted
authorities
were
unable
to
secure
them
they
remind
one
very
much
of
the
vigilance
committees
which
in
our
own
country
in
the
cities
of
the
distant
west
bravely
and
with
the
admirable
prudence
of
the
race
have
so
often
supplied
the
place
of
regular
courts
and
have
brought
justice
and
order
out
of
the
chaos
of
lawlessness
the
last
place
most
people
would
expect
their
prototypes
however
would
be
here
in
the
germany
of
the
thirteenth
century
how
much
these
vehmgerichte
accomplished
during
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
they
represent
an
outgrowth
of
the
spirit
of
the
people
themselves
that
constitutes
another
striking
feature
of
the
practical
side
of
the
generations
of
the
thirteenth
century
they
had
much
more
to
do
with
bringing
about
the
development
of
the
modern
acute
sense
of
justice
among
the
teutonic
peoples
than
is
usually
thought
they
are
the
german
expression
of
the
same
feelings
that
in
england
dictated
trial
by
jury
and
secured
for
the
english
speaking
people
of
all
time
the
precious
privileges
of
justice
and
the
right
to
be
judged
by
one
peers
it
was
not
alone
in
the
western
countries
of
europe
that
great
advances
were
made
in
liberty
the
democratic
spirit
that
was
abroad
made
itself
felt
everywhere
and
the
foundations
of
rights
for
the
people
were
laid
even
in
central
europe
in
countries
which
ordinarily
are
thought
of
at
this
time
as
scarcely
more
than
emerging
from
barbarism
hungary
may
be
cited
as
an
example
andrew
ii
is
usually
set
down
by
historians
as
having
been
entirely
too
visionary
in
his
character
and
the
fact
that
he
led
the
fifth
crusade
apparently
even
more
fruitless
than
were
most
of
the
others
is
supposed
to
be
an
additional
proof
of
this
even
duruy
in
his
history
of
the
middle
ages
says
of
him
he
organized
a
state
of
anarchy
by
decreeing
his
golden
bull
that
if
the
king
should
violate
the
privileges
of
the
nobility
they
should
be
permitted
to
resist
him
by
force
and
such
resistance
should
not
be
treated
as
rebellion
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
people
were
thus
granted
a
constitution
more
liberal
even
than
that
of
magna
charta
but
containing
quite
similar
provisions
in
many
respects
and
the
curious
historical
analogy
is
heightened
when
we
recall
that
at
the
two
ends
of
civilized
europe
these
constitutions
were
given
in
the
same
decade
one
can
not
help
but
wonder
whether
the
saxon
elements
which
were
in
both
peoples
for
many
saxon
and
frisian
colonists
had
been
induced
to
settle
in
certain
parts
of
transylvania
just
half
a
century
before
did
not
have
much
to
do
with
this
extremely
interesting
development
in
hungary
so
like
the
corresponding
evolution
of
the
democratic
spirit
among
their
western
kinsfolk
in
poland
the
development
in
law
came
a
little
later
but
evidently
as
the
result
of
the
same
factors
that
were
at
work
during
the
thirteenth
century
casimir
the
great
who
was
born
shortly
after
the
close
of
the
thirteenth
century
gave
wise
laws
to
poland
which
have
constituted
the
basis
of
polish
law
ever
since
at
this
time
poland
was
one
of
the
most
important
countries
in
europe
casimir
besides
giving
laws
to
his
people
also
founded
a
university
for
them
and
in
every
way
encouraged
the
development
of
such
progress
as
would
make
his
subjects
intelligently
realize
their
own
rights
and
maintain
them
apparently
foreseeing
that
thus
the
king
would
be
better
able
to
strengthen
himself
against
the
many
enemies
that
surrounded
him
in
central
europe
how
much
the
great
popes
of
the
century
accomplished
for
the
foundation
and
development
of
law
can
only
be
appreciated
by
those
who
realize
the
extent
of
their
contributions
to
the
codification
of
canon
law
it
was
the
arrangement
of
this
in
definite
shape
that
put
the
civil
jurists
of
the
time
at
work
setting
their
house
in
order
innocent
who
is
deservedly
called
devoted
a
great
deal
of
his
wonderful
energy
and
genius
to
the
arrangement
of
canon
law
this
placed
for
the
first
time
the
canon
law
on
an
absolutely
sure
footing
and
filled
up
many
gaps
that
formerly
existed
gregory
ix
commissioned
his
chaplain
the
famous
raymond
of
pennafort
who
had
been
a
professor
of
canon
law
in
the
university
of
bologna
to
codify
all
the
decretals
since
the
time
of
gratian
this
work
was
officially
promulgated
in
four
years
of
labor
having
been
devoted
to
it
the
laws
are
in
the
form
of
decisions
pronounced
in
cases
submitted
to
the
pope
from
all
parts
of
christendom
including
many
from
the
distant
east
and
not
a
few
from
england
and
scotland
gregory
decretals
were
published
in
five
books
a
supplement
under
the
name
of
the
sixth
book
was
published
under
pope
boniface
viii
in
in
this
for
the
first
time
abstract
rules
of
law
are
laid
down
extracted
from
actual
judgments
a
compendium
of
roman
law
was
added
so
as
to
approximate
canon
and
civil
procedure
this
gives
the
best
possible
idea
of
how
deeply
the
popes
and
the
authorities
in
canon
law
of
the
century
were
laying
the
foundations
of
canonical
practise
and
procedure
for
all
times
the
origins
of
modern
law
are
to
be
found
here
and
yet
not
as
might
be
anticipated
because
of
the
distance
in
time
in
such
a
confused
or
unmanageable
fashion
that
they
are
not
worth
while
consulting
but
on
the
contrary
with
such
clarity
and
distinctness
and
with
such
orderly
arrangement
that
they
have
been
the
subjects
of
study
on
the
part
of
distinguished
jurists
for
most
of
the
centuries
ever
since
and
have
never
lost
their
interest
for
the
great
lawyers
and
canonists
who
prefer
to
know
things
from
the
foundation
rather
than
accept
them
at
second
hand
some
of
the
commentaries
or
glosses
as
they
were
called
on
canon
law
serve
to
give
an
excellent
idea
of
the
legal
ability
as
well
as
the
intellectual
acumen
of
the
canon
lawyers
of
the
century
the
system
of
teaching
was
oral
and
careful
study
was
devoted
to
original
authorities
in
law
explanatory
notes
were
added
by
the
professors
to
their
copies
of
the
text
when
later
these
texts
were
given
out
or
lent
for
transcription
the
notes
were
also
copied
usually
being
written
in
the
margin
after
a
time
the
commentary
however
proved
to
be
for
students
at
least
as
important
as
the
text
and
so
was
transcribed
by
itself
and
was
called
an
apparatus
that
is
a
series
of
mechanical
helps
as
it
were
to
the
understanding
of
the
text
of
the
names
of
some
of
the
most
distinguished
glossatores
the
memory
has
been
carefully
preserved
because
they
produced
so
much
effect
on
legal
teaching
the
gloss
written
on
gratian
by
joannes
teutonicus
john
the
german
probably
during
the
first
decade
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
revised
and
supplemented
by
bartholomew
of
brescia
about
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
some
ten
years
later
bernard
of
parma
wrote
a
commentary
on
the
decretals
of
gregory
all
of
these
are
important
fundamental
works
in
canon
law
and
they
were
of
very
great
influence
in
bringing
out
the
principles
of
law
and
showing
the
basis
on
which
they
were
founded
it
is
almost
needless
to
say
that
they
aroused
additional
interest
and
made
the
subject
much
more
easy
of
approach
than
it
had
been
the
fact
that
all
of
these
magnificent
contributions
to
the
science
and
literatures
of
law
should
have
been
made
during
our
thirteenth
century
serves
only
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
everything
that
men
touched
during
this
period
was
sure
to
be
illuminated
by
the
practical
genius
of
the
time
and
put
into
a
form
in
which
for
many
centuries
it
was
to
be
appealed
to
as
a
model
and
an
authority
in
its
own
line
how
much
of
legal
commentary
writing
there
was
besides
these
can
be
readily
understood
from
the
fact
that
these
represent
the
activity
only
of
the
university
of
bologna
which
was
it
is
true
the
greatest
of
universities
in
its
law
department
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
many
other
universities
throughout
europe
also
had
distinguished
professors
of
law
at
this
time
all
this
would
seem
to
be
of
little
interest
for
the
secular
of
the
period
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
civil
law
was
closely
related
to
canon
law
at
all
times
and
that
the
development
of
canon
law
always
meant
a
renewed
evolution
of
the
principles
and
practise
and
procedure
of
the
civil
law
in
such
countries
as
scotland
indeed
the
canon
law
formed
the
basis
of
the
civil
jurisprudence
and
its
influence
was
felt
even
for
centuries
after
the
reformation
on
the
other
hand
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
popes
and
the
ecclesiastics

fight
the
battles
of
the
middle
and
lower
classes
against
the

the
nobility
in

every

a
very
striking
example
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
life
of
that
much
misunderstood
pope
boniface
the
last
pope
of
the
century
who
had
received
his
legal
training
at
bologna
and
who
was
one
of
the
great
jurists
of
his
time
circumstances
differ
so
much
however
and
obscure
realities
to
such
a
degree
that
at
the

we
need
the
light
of
sympathetic
interpretation
to
enable
us
to
realize
what

to
make

furnished
the

of
this
subject
does
not
hesitate
to
declare
that
the
bull
far
from
being
subversive
of
political
liberties
or
expressive
of
too
arrogant
a
spirit
on
the
part
of
the
church
was
really
an
expression
of
a
great
principle
that
was
to
become
very
prominent
in
modern
history
and
the
basis
of
many
of
the
modern
declarations
of
rights
against
the
claims
of
tyranny
he
says
in
part
imprudent
headlong
but
in
its
main
contention
founded
on
history
this
extraordinary
declared
that
the
laity
had
always
been
hostile
to
the

and
were
so
now
as
much
as
ever
but
they
possessed
no
jurisdiction
over
the
persons
no
claims
on
the
property
of
the
church
though
they
had
dared
to
exact
a
tenth
nay
even
a
half
of
its
income
for
secular
objects
and
prelates
had
not
resisted

on
no
title
whatsoever
from
henceforth
should
such

democracy
is
a
word
to
conjure
with
but
it
is
usually
considered
that
the
thing
it
represents
had
its
origin
in
the
modern

much
later
than
the
period
with
which

are

their
privileges
and
to
ask
that
they

to
be

product
of
the
last
century

two

in

more
than
any

in

of
this
period
are
pointed
out
and
their
significance
made
clear
it
will
become
evident
that
the
foundations
of
our
modern
democracy
were
deeply
laid
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
that
the
spirit
of
what
was
best
in
the
aspiration
of
people
to
be
ruled
by
themselves
for
themselves
and
of
themselves
had
its
birth
in
this
precious
seed
time
of
so
much
that
is
important
for
our
modern
life
lest
it
should
be
thought
that
this
idea
of
the
development
of
democracy
has
been
engendered
merely
in
the
enthusiastic
ardor

special
admiration
for
the
author
favorite
century
it
seems
well
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
historians
in
recent
years
have
very
generally
emphasized
the
role
that
the
thirteenth
century
played
in
the
development
of
freedom
a
typical
example
may
be
quoted
from
the
history
of
freedom
by
professor
james
hosmer
footnote
who
does
not
hesitate
to
say
that
while
in
england
representative
government
was
gradually
developing
during
this
century
in
germany
the
cities
were
beginning
to
send
deputies
to
the
imperial
parliament
and
the
emperor
frederick
was
allowing
a
certain
amount
of
representation
in
the
government
of
sicily
in
spain
alfonso
the
wise
of
castile
permitted
the
cities
to
send
representatives
to
the
cortez
and
in
france
this
same
spirit
developed
to
such
a
degree
that
a
representative
parliament
met
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
in
none
of
these
countries
however
unfortunately
did
the
spirit
of
representative
government
continue
to
develop
as
in
england
and
in
many
of
them
the
privileges
obtained
in
the
thirteenth
century
were
subsequently
lost

certain
phases
of
the
rise
of

have
already
been

the

can
only
be
referred
to
them
now
with
the
definite
idea
of
recognizing
in
them
the
democratic
tendencies
of
the

what
we

about
the

extremely

in
its

after

the
hanseatic

was
only
one
manifestation
of
these

its
widespread
influence
in
awakening
in
people
minds
the
realization
that
they
could
do
for
themselves
much
more
and
secure
success
in
their
endeavors
much
better
by
their
own
united
efforts
than
by
anything
that
their
accepted
political
rulers
could
do

at

would
do
for

be
readily
appreciated
by
all
who
read
that
chapter
hansa
must
have
been
a
great
enlightener
for
the
teutonic
peoples
the
history
of
the
league
shows
over
and
over
again
their
political
rulers
rather
interfering
with
than
fostering
their
commercial
prosperity
these
rulers
were
always
more
than
a
little
jealous
of
the
wealth
which
the
citizens
of
these
growing
towns
in
their
realm
were
able
to
accumulate
and
they
showed
it
on
more
than
one
occasion
the
history
of
the
hansa
towns
exhibits
the
citizens
doing
everything
to
dissemble
the
feelings
of
disaffection
that
inevitably
came
to
them
as
the
result
of
their
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
they
could
rule
themselves
so
much
better
than
they
were
being
ruled
and
that
they
could
accomplish
so
much
more
for
themselves
by
their
commercial
combination
with
other
cities
than
had
ever
been
done
for
them
by
these
hereditary
princes
who
claimed
so
much
yet
gave
so
little
in
their
turn
the
training
in
that
came
with
the
necessities
for
defense
as
well
as
for
the
protection
of
commercial
visitors
from
other
cities
in
the
league
who
trustfully
came
to
deal
with
their
people
was
an
education
in
democracy
such
as
could
not
fail
to
bring
results
the
rise
of
the
free
cities
in
germany
represents
the
growth
of
the
democratic
spirit
down
to
our
own
time
better
than
any
other
single
set
of
manifestations
that
we
have
the
international
relations
of
these
cities
did
more
as
we
have
said
to
broaden
men
minds
and
make
them
realize
the
brotherhood
of
man
in
spite
of
national
boundaries
than
any
other
factor
in
human
history
commerce
has
always
been
a
great
leveler
and
such
it
proved
to
be
in
these
early
days
in
germany
only
it
must
not
be
thought
that
these
german
cities
had
but
faint
glimmerings
of
the
great
purpose
they
were
engaged
in
for
seldom
has
the
spirit
of
popular
government
risen
higher
than
with
them
how
clearly
the
teutonic
mind
had
grasped
the
idea
of
democracy
can
be
best
appreciated
perhaps
from
the
attitude
of
the
swiss
in
this
matter
these
hardy
mountaineers
whose
difficult
country
and
rather
severe
climate
separate
them
effectually
from
the
other
nations
soon
learned
the
advisability
of
ruling
themselves
for
their
own
benefit
before
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
they
had
formed
a
defensive
and
offensive
union
among
themselves
against
the
hapsburgs
and
though
for
a
time
overborne
by
the
influence
of
this
house
after
its
head
ascended
the
imperial
throne
immediately
on
rudolph
death
they
proceeded
to
unite
themselves
still
more
firmly
together
they
then
formed
the
famous
league
of
which
represents
so
important
a
step
in
the
democracy
of
modern
times
the
formal
document
which
constituted
this
league
a
federal
government
deserves
to
be
quoted
it
is
the
first
great
declaration
of
independence
and
its
ideas
were
to
crop
out
in
many
another

democracy
was
fostered
in
the
guilds
which
as
we
have
already
seen
in
connection
with
the
cathedrals
proved
the
sources
of
education
and
intellectual
development
in
nearly
every
mode
of
thought
and
art
the
most
interesting
feature
of
these
guilds
was
the
fact
that
they
were
not
institutions
suggested
to
the
workmen
and
tradesmen
by
those
above
them
but
were
the
outgrowth
of
the
spirit
of
self
help
and
organization
which
came
over
mankind
during
this
century
at
the
beginning
they
were
scarcely
more
than
simple
beneficial
associations
meant
to
be
aids
in
times
of
sickness
and
trial
and
to
make
the
parting
of
families
and
especially
the
death
of
the
head
of
the
family
not
quite
so
difficult
for
the
survivors
since
affiliated
brother
workmen
remained
behind
who
would
care
for
them
during
this
century
however
the
spirit
of
democracy
that
is
the
organized
effort
of
the
people
to
take
care
of
themselves
better
their
conditions
and
add
to
their
own
happiness
led
to
the
development
of
the
guilds
in
a
fashion
that
it
is
rather
difficult
for
generations
of
the
modern
time
to
understand
for
our
trades
unions
do
not
as
yet
at
least
present
anything
that
quite
resembles
their
work
in
our
times
it
was
because
of
the
effective
social
work
of
these
guilds
that
urbain
gohier
the
french
socialist
and
writer
on
sociological
subjects
was
able
to
say
not
long
ago
in
the
north
american
review
when
the
workmen
of
the
european
continent
demand
three
eights
eight
hours
of
work
eight
hours
of
rest
and
refreshment
physical
and
mental
and
eight
hours
of
sleep
some
of
them
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
reform
already
exists
in
the
countries
but
all
are
ignorant
of
this
other
fact
that
during
the
middle
ages
in
an
immense
number
of
labor
corporations
and
cities
a
was
often
only
nine
eight
and
even
seven
hours
long
nor
have
they
ever
been
told
that
every
saturday
and
on
the
eve
of
over
two
dozen
holidays
work
was
stopped
everywhere
at
four
the
saturday
half
holiday
began
it
may
be
said
even
earlier
namely
at
the
vesper
hour
which
according
to
medieval
church
customs
was
some
time
between
two
and
three
and
the
same
was
true
on
the
vigils
as
the
eves
of
the
important
church
festivals
were
called
the
only
possible
way
to
give
a
reasonably
good
idea
of
the
spirit
of
the
guilds
which
succeeded
in
accomplishing
such
a
wonderful
social
revolution
is
to
quote
some
of
their
rules
which
serve
to
show
their
intents
and
purposes
at
least
even
though
they
may
not
always
have
fulfilled
their
aims
their
rules
regard
two
things
particularly
the
religious
and
the
social
functions
of
the
guild
there
was
a
fine
for
absence
from
the
special
religious
services
held
for
the
members
but
also
a
fine
of
equal
amount
for
absence
from
the
annual
banquet
in
this
they
resemble
the
rules
of
the
religious
orders
which
were
coming
to
be
widely
known
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
and
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
according
to
which
the
members
of
the
religious
community
were
required
quite
as
strictly
to
be
present
at
daily
recreation
that
is
at
the
hour
of
conversation
after
meals
as
at
daily
prayer
an
interesting
phase
of
the
social
rules
of
the
guild
is
that
a
member
was
expected
to
bring

with
him
or
if
not
his
wife
then
his
sweetheart
they
were
franker
in
these
matters
in
this
simpler
age
and
doubtless
the
custom
encouraged
matrimony
a
little
bit
more
than
our
modern
colder
customs
as
giving
a
fair
idea
of
the
ordinances
of
the
guilds
in
their
original
shape
the
rules
of
the
guild
of
luke
at
lincoln
may
be
cited
luke
had
been
chosen
as
patron
because
according
to
tradition
he
was
an
artist
as
well
as
an
evangelist
the
patron
saint
was
chosen
always
so
that
he
might
be
a
model
of
life
as
well
as
a
protector
in
heaven
its
members
were
the
painters
guilders
stainers
and
alabaster
men
of
the
city
the
first
rule
provides
that
on
the
sunday
next
after
the
feast
of
luke
all
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
guild
shall
with
their
officers
go
in
procession
from
an
appointed
place
carrying
a
great
candle
to
the
cathedral
church
of
lincoln
and
there
every
two
of
the
brethren
and
sisters
shall
offer
one
or
more
after
their
devotion
and
then
shall
offer
the
great
candle
before
an
image
of
luke
within
the
church
and
any
who
were
absent
without
lawful
cause
shall
forfeit
one
pound
of
wax
to
the
sustentation
of
the
said
great
candle
on
the
same
sunday
for
love
and
amity
and
good
communication
to
be
had
for
the
several
weal
of
the
fraternity
the
guildmen
dined
together
every
brother
paying
for
himself
and
his
wife
or
sweetheart
the
sum
of
four
pence
absentees
were
fined
one
pound
of
wax
towards
the
aforesaid
candle
the
third
rule
provided
that
four
mornspeeches
that
its
business
meetings
should
be
held
each
year
for
ordering
and
good
rule
to
be
had
and
made
amongst
them
absentees
from
a
mornspeech
forfeited
one
pound
of
wax
to
luke
candle
another
rule
provided
that
the
decision
of
ambiguities
or
doubts
about
the
forfeitures
prescribed
should
be
referred
to
the
mayor
and
four
aldermen
of
the
city
rules
to
and
also
regulate
the
taking
of
apprentices
and
the
setting
up
in
trade
forbid
the
employing
of
strangers
provide
for
the
settlement
of
disputes
and
the
examination
of
work
not
sufficiently
done
after
the
sample
already
the
tendency
to
limit
the
number
of
workmen
that
might
be
employed
which
was
later
to
prove
a
stumbling
block
to
artistic
progress
is
to
be
noted
on
the
other
hand
the
effort
to
keep
work
up
to
a
certain
standard
which
was
to
mean
so
much
for
artistic
accomplishment
in
the
next
few
generations
must
be
noted
as
a
compensatory
feature
of
the
guild

for

holding
the
tokens
the
bread
to
be
distributed
at
the

of
the
parish
in
which
the
deceased
lived
this
twelfth
rule
with
regard
to
the
manner
of
giving
charity
is
particularly
striking
because
it
shows
a
deliberate
effort
to
avoid
certain
dangers
the
evil
possibilities
of
which
our
modern
organized
charity
has
emphasized
according
to
this
rule
of
the
guild
of
luke
at
lincoln
all
the
members
were
bound
to
give
a
certain
amount
in
charity
for
the
benefit
of
a
deceased
member
this
was
not
however
by
direct
alms
but
by
means
of
tokens
for
which
they
paid
a
fixed
price
to
the
dean
who
redeemed
the
tokens
when
they
were
presented
by
the
deserving
poor
this
guaranteed
that
each
member
would
give
the
fixed
sum
in
charity
and
at
the
same
time
safeguarded
the
almsgiving
from
any
abuses
since
the
member
of
the
guild
himself
would
be
likely
to
know
something
of
the
poor
person
and
his
deservingness
and
if
not
there
was
always
the
question
of
the
dean
being
informed
with
regard
to
the
needs
of
the
case
all
of
this
was
accomplished
however
without
hurting
the
feelings
of
the
recipients
of
the
charity
since
they
felt
that
it
was
done
not
for
them
but
for
the
benefit
of
a
deceased
member
how
much
the
guilds
came
to
influence
the
life
of
the
people
during
the
next
two
centuries
may
be
best
appreciated
from
their
great
increase
in
number
and
wealth
in
england
it
is
computed
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
there
were
thirty
thousand
of
these
institutions
spread
over
the
country
the
county
of
norfolk
alone
had
nine
hundred
of
which
number
the
small
town
of
wymondham
had
at
least
eleven
still
known
by
names
one
the
guild
of
holy
trinity
wymondham
being
possessed
of
a
of
its
own
whilst
it
and
the
other
guilds
of
the
town
are
said
to
have
been
well
endowed
with
lands
and
tenements
in
bury
edmunds
suffolk
there
were
guilds
boston
lincolnshire
had
fourteen
of
which
the
titles
and
other
particulars
are
known
whilst
in
london
their
number
must
have
been
very
great
of
the
london
trade
guilds
stow
the
elizabethan
antiquary
records
the
names
of
sixty
of
sufficient
importance
to
entitle
their
representatives
to
places
at
the
civic
banquets
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
many
of
them
are
still
in
existence
having
been
spared
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
on
the
plea
that
they
were
trading
or
secular
associations
fifteen
of
the
largest
of
them
including
the
merchant
tailors
the
goldsmiths
and
the
stationers
have
at
the
present
time
an
annual
income
of
over
each
the
reasons
for
their
popularity
can
be
readily
found
in
the
many
social
needs
which
they
cared
for
socialistic
cooperation
has
perhaps
never
been
carried
so
far
as
in
these
medieval
institutions
which
were
literally
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
often
their
regulation
made
provisions
for
insurance
against
poverty
fire
and
sometimes
against
burglary
frequently
they
provided
schoolmasters
for
the
schools
their
funds
they
loaned
out
to
needy
brethren
in
small
sums
on
easy
terms
whilst
trade
and
other
disputes
likely
to
give
rise
to
and
contention
were
constantly
referred
to
the
guilds
for
arbitration
one
of
the
rules
of
the
guild
of
our
lady
at
wymondham
thus
ordains
that
for
no
manner
of
cause
should
any
of
the
brothers
or
sisters
of
the
fraternity
go
to
law
till
the
officers
of
the
guild
had
been
informed
of
the
circumstances
and
had
done
their
best
to
settle
the
dispute
and
restore
unity
and
love
betwixt
the
parties
to
assist
at
the
burial
of
deceased
brethren
and
to
aid
in
providing
for
the
celebration
of
obits
for
the
repose
of
their
souls
were
duties
incumbent
on
all
defaulters
without
good
excuse
being
subject
to
fines
and
censure
it
must
not
be
thought
that
these
tendencies
to
true
democracy
were
confined
to
the
trades
guilds
however
the
historian
of
the
merchant
guilds
has
demonstrated
that
they
had
the
same
spirit
and
this
was
especially
true
for
the
great
guild
merchant
he
says
to
this
category
of
powerful
affinities
must
be
added
the
gild
merchant
the
latter
was
from
the
outset
a
compact
body
emphatically
characterized
by
fraternal
solidarity
of
interests
a
protective
union
that
naturally
engendered
a
consciousness
of
strength
and
a
spirit
of
independence
as
the
same
men
generally
directed
the
counsels
of
both
the
town
and
the
gild
there
would
be
a
gradual
unconscious
extension
of
the
unity
of
the
one
to
the
other
the
cohesive
force
of
the
gild
making
itself
felt
throughout
the
whole
municipal
organism
but
the
influence
of
the
fraternity
was
material
as
well
as
moral
it
constituted
a
bond
of
union
between
the
heterogeneous
sokes
classes
of
tenants
of
a
borough
the
townsmen
might
be
exclusively
amenable
to
the
courts
of
different
lords
but
if
engaged
in
trade
within
the
town
they
were
all
members
of
one
and
the
same
gild
merchant
the
independent
regulation
of
trade
also
accustomed
the
burgesses
to
and
constituted
an
important
step
toward
autonomy
the
town
judiciary
was
always
more
dependent
upon
the
crown
or
mesne
lord
than
was
the
gild
merchant
because
of
the
supreme
interest
in
everything
connected
with
shakespeare
the
existence
of
one
of
the
most
important
guilds
in
stratford
has
led
to
the
illustration
of
guilds
works
there
better
than
for
any
english
town
during
this
period
the
guild
of
the
holy
cross
was
the
most
important
institution
of
stratford
and
enthusiastic
shakespeare
scholars
have
applied
themselves
to
find
out
every
detail
of
its
history
as
far
as
it
is
now
available
in
order
to
make
clear
the
conditions
social
and
religious
that
existed
in
the
great
dramatist
birthplace
halliwell
in
his
descriptive
calendar
of
the
records
of
stratford
on
avon
and
sidney
lee
in
his
stratford
on
avon
in
the
time
of
the
shakespeares
have
gathered
together
much
of
this
information
the
guild
has
lasted
wrote
its
chief
officer
in
for
many
many
years
and
its
beginning
was
from
time
whereunto
the
memory
of
man
reaches
not
bowden
in
his
volume
on
the
religion
of
shakespeare
has
a
number
of
the
most
important
details
with
regard
to
stratford
guild
the
earliest
extant
documents
with
regard
to
it
are
from
the
reign
of
henry
and
include
a
deed
of
gift
by
one
william
sede
of
a
tenement
to
the
guild
and
an
indulgence
granted
october
by
giffard
bishop
of
wooster
of
forty
days
to
all
sincere
penitents
who
after
having
duly
confessed
had
conferred
benefits
on
the
guild
by
the
close
of
the
reign
of
edward
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
guild
was
wealthy
in
houses
and
lands
and
the
foundation
was
laid
of
its
chapel
and
almshouses
which
with
the
hall
of
meeting
the
rode
or
reed
hall
stood
where
the
guild
hall
is
at
the
present
day
edward
iii
and
richard
during
the
fourteenth
century
confirmed
the
rights
of
the
guild
and
even
added
to
its
privileges
though
it
was
a
purely
local
institution
the
fame
of
its
good
works
had
spread
so
wide
during
these
next
centuries
that
affiliation
with
it
became
a
distinction
and
the
nobility
were
attracted
to
its
ranks
george
duke
of
clarence
brother
of
edward
with
his
wife
and
children
and
the
earl
of
warwick
and
the
lady
margaret
were
counted
among
its
members
and
merchants
of
distant
towns
counted
it
an
honor
to
belong
to
it
later
also
judge
littleton
one
of
the
famous
founders
of
english
law
was
on
its
roll
of
membership
the
objects
of
the
guild
were
many
and
varied
and
touched
the
social
life
of
stratford
at
every
point
the
first
object
was
mutual
prayer
the
guild
maintained
five
priests
or
chaplains
who
were
to
say
masses
daily
hour
by
hour
from
six
to
ten
for
its
members
it
being
expected
that
some
of
them
would
be
present
at
each
of
the
masses
out
of
the
fees
of
the
guild
one
wax
candle
was
to
be
kept
alight
every
day
throughout
the
year
at
every
mass
in
the
church
before
the
rood
or
cross
so
that
god
and
our
blessed
virgin
and
the
venerated
cross
may
keep
and
guard
all
the
brethren
and
sisters
of
the
guilds
from
every
the
second
object
was
charity
under
which
was
included
all
the
various
works
of
mercy
the
needs
of
any
brother
or
sister
who
had
fallen
into
poverty
or
been
robbed
were
to
be
provided
for
as
long
as
he
bears
himself
rightly
towards
the
brethren
when
a
brother
died
all
the
brethren
were
bound
to
follow
the
body
to
the
church
and
to
pray
for
his
soul
at
its
burial
the
guild
candle
and
eight
smaller
ones
were
to
be
kept
burning
by
the
body
from
the
time
of
death
till
the
funeral
when
a
poor
man
died
in
the
town
the
brethren
and
sisters
were
for
their
soul
health
to
find
four
wax
candles
a
sheet
and
a
hearse
cloth
for
the
corpse
this
rule
also
applied
in
the
event
of
a
stranger
death
if
the
stranger
had
not
the
necessary
means
for
burial
nor
were
the
efforts
of
the
guild
at
stratford
devoted
solely
to
the
alleviation
of
the
ills
of
mankind
and
the
more
serious
purposes
of
life
once
a
year
in
easter
week
a
feast
of
the
members
was
held
in
order
to
foster
peace
and
true
brotherly
love
among
them
at
this
time
offerings
were
made
for
the
poor
in
order
that
they
too
might
share
in
the
happiness
of
the
festival
time
there
was
attendance
at
church
before
the
feasting
and
a
prayer
was
offered
by
all
the
brethren
and
sisters
that
god
and
our
blessed
virgin
and
the
venerated
cross
in
whose
honor
we
have
come
together
will
keep
us
from
all
ills
and
sins
this
frequent
reference
to
the
cross
will
be
better
understood
if
it
is
recalled
that
the
guild
at
stratford
bore
the
name
of
the
guild
of
the
holy
cross
and
the
figure
of
the
crucified
one
was
one
of
its
most
respected
symbols
and
was
always
looked
upon
as
a
special
object
of
veneration
on
the
part
of
the
members
the
thoroughly
progressive
spirit
of
the
guild
at
stratford
will
perhaps
be
best
appreciated
by
the
modern
mind
from
the
fact
that
to
it
the
town
owed
the
foundation
of
its
famous
free
school
during
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
the
study
of
grammar
and
of
the
various
theoretical
branches
was
not
considered
the
essential
part
of
an
education
gradually
however
there
had
arisen
the
feeling
that
all
the
children
should
be
taught
the
of
the
vulgar
tongue
and
that
those
whose
parents
wished
it
should
receive
education
in
latin
also
hence
the
establishment
of
grammar
schools
that
at
stratford
being
founded
for
the
children
of
the
members
of
the
guild
about
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
this
was
only
the
normal
development
of
the
earlier
spirit
of
the
guild
which
enabled
it
to
meet
the
growing
social
needs
of
the
time
it
was
at
this
school
as
reconstituted
under
edward
that
shakespeare
was
educated
and
the
reestablishment
by
edward
was
only
in
response
to
the
many
complaints
which
arose
because
of
the
absence
of
the
school
after
its
suppression
by
henry
viii
the
fact
that
shakespeare
was
educated
at
an
edward
vi
grammar
school
has
often
given
occasion
for
commentators
to
point
out
that
it
was
practically
the
reformation
in
england
which
led
to
the
establishment
of
free
schools
any
such
suggestion
however
can
be
made
only
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
preexisting
state
of
affairs
in
which
the
people
by
organization
succeeded
in
accomplishing
so
much
for
themselves
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
guild
at
stratford
as
in
most
of
the
towns
in
england
for
we
have
taken
this
as
an
example
only
because
it
is
easier
to
get
at
the
details
of
its
history
was
the
most
important
factor
in
the
preservation
of
social
order
in
the
distribution
of
charity
in
the
providing
of
education
and
even
the
maintenance
of
the
security
of
the
life
and
property
of
its
inhabitants
when
it
was
dissolved
in
stratford
found
itself
in
a
chaotic
state
and
had
to
petition
edward
vi
to
reconstitute
the
guild
as
a
civil
corporation
which
he
did
by
charter
in
after
this
consideration
of
the
guilds
and
their
purpose
and
success
it
is
no
wonder
that
we
should
declare
that
the
wind
of
the
spirit
of
democracy
was
blowing
in
england
and
carrying
away
the
old
landmarks
of
absolute
government
it
is
to
the
spirit
thus
fostered
that
must
be
attributed
the
marvelous
progress
in
representative
government
the
steps
of
which
we
recall
in
all
england
united
against
the
odious
john
lackland
and

and
one
of
them
at
least
because
of
its
importance
deserves
to
be
recalled
here
in
the
chapter
on
great
beginnings
of
modern
commerce
we
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
crusades
were
responsible
to
a
great
degree
for
the
spirit
of
enterprise
which
led
to
the
formation
of
the
lombard
league
of
cities
and
later
to
the
great
hanseatic
league
which
seems
to
have
taken
at
least
its
incentive
from
the
southern
confederation
in
the
chapter
on
louis
ix
we
point
out
that
the
crusades
and
his
connection
with
them
far
from
being
blots
on
louis
career
must
rather
be
considered
as
manifestations
of
the
great
heart
of
the
time
which
was
awakening
to
all
needs
and
had
its
religious
aspirations
stirred
so
deeply
that
men
were
ready
to
give
up
everything
in
order
to
follow
an
idea
one
thing
is
certain
the
crusades
did
more
to
set
ferments
at
work
in
the
social
organization
of
europe
than
would
have
been
possible
by
any
other
movement
these
ferments
brought
about
two
results
one
the
uplift
of
the
common
people
the
other
the
centralization
of
power
in
the
hands
of
the
kings
with
the
gradual
diminution
of
the
influence
of
the
nobility
while
fostering
the
spirit
of
democracy
on
the
one
hand
they
gave
birth
to
the
spirit
of
nationality
and
to
all
that
this
has
accomplished
in
modern
history
storrs
in
his
life
of
bernard
recently
issued
has
given
expression
to
this
thought
in
a
very
striking
fashion
he
says
it
used
to
be
the
fashion
to
regard
the
crusades
as
mere
fantastic
exhibitions
of
a
temporary
turbulent
religious
fanaticism
aiming
at
ends
wholly
visionary
and
missing
them
wasting
the
best
life
of
europe
in
colossal
and
bloody
undertakings
and
leaving
effects
only
of
evil
for
the
time
which
came
after
more
reasonable
views
now
prevail
and
while
the
impulse
in
which
the
vast
movement
took
its
rise
is
recognized
as
passionate
and
it
is
seen
that
many
effects
followed
which
were
beneficial
rather
than
harmful
which
could
not
perhaps
have
been
at
the
time
in
other
ways
realized
as
i
have
already
suggested
properties

to
an
important
extent
redistributed

affected
lands
were
sold
at
low
prices
by
those
who
were
going
on
the
distant
expeditions
very
probably
as
they
knew
never
to
return
and
horses
and
armor
with
all
martial
equipments
were
bought
at
high
prices
by
the
jews

could
not
hold

history
of
whom

in
fearful
lines

the

to

come
more
strictly

thus
increasing
the

at
the

general

instead
of
local
a
less
minutely
oppressive
administration
the

the
movement
toward
national

it
is
a
noticeable
fact
that
italy
took
but
a
comparatively
small
part
in
the
crusades
and
the
long
postponement
of
organic
union
between
different
parts
of
the
magnificent
peninsula
is
not
without
relation
to
this
the
influence
which
operated
elsewhere
in
europe
to
efface
distinction
of
custom
and
language
in
separate
communities
to
override
and
extinguish
local
animosities
to
make
scattered
peoples

persistent

of

from

these
ideas
were
the
first
to
shake
the
stern
despotism
of
feudality
by
opposing
to
it
the
generous
principles
of
chivalry
which
sprang
all
armed
from
the
crusades
bound
to
the
military
orders
by
a
solemn
vow
and
in
the
interests
of
all
christendom
the
knight
felt
himself
free
from
feudal
dependence
and
raised
above
national
limits
as
the
immediate
warrior
and
servant
of
the
united
christendom
and
of
god
chivalry
founded
not
upon
territorial
influence
but
upon
personal
distinction
necessarily
weakened
nobility
by
rendering
it
accessible
to
all
and
diminishing
the
interval
which
separated
the
different
classes
of
society
every
warrior
who
had
distinguished
himself
by
his
valor
could
kneel
before
the
king
to
be
dubbed
a
knight
and
rise
up

equal

superior
even
of
powerful
vassals
the
poorest
knight
could
sit
at

the
noble
son
of

duke
or
prince
was
excluded
unless
he
had
won
the
golden
spurs
of
knighthood
another
way
by
which
the
crusades
contributed
to
the
decay
of
feudalism
was
by
favoring
the
enfranchisement
of
serfs
even
without
the
consent
of
their
masters
whoever
took
the
cross
became
free
just
as
every

development
is
to
be
referred
to
the
period
of

rapidly

granting
charters

men
and

the
royal
power

that
of
the
aristocracy
decreased
the

was
enlarged
by
the
escheating
of
a
great
number
of
fiefs
which
had
been
left
vacant
by
the
death
of
their
lords
the
kings
protected
the
communities
favored
their
enfranchisement

employed
them
usefully
against
insubordinate
vassals
the

the
organization
of
the
nation
by
establishing
a
principle
of
unity
for
till
then
and
with
that
multitude
of
masters
the
nation
had
been
little
else
than
an
agglomeration
of
provinces
strangers
to
one
another
and
destitute
of
any
common
bond
or
common
interest
the
great
vassals
themselves
often
united
under
the
royal
banner
became
accustomed
during
these
distant
expeditions
to
submission
and
discipline
and
learned
to
recognize
a
legitimate
authority
and
if
they
lost
by
this
submission
a
part
of
their
personal
power
they
gained
in
compensation
the
honorable
distinctions
of
chivalry

it
was
not
the
national
feeling
alone
which
was
fostered
by
the
crusades
relations
of
fraternity

then
wholly
unknown
grew
up
between

and
softened
the
antipathy
of

the
knights
whom
a
common
object
united
in
common
dangers
became
brothers
in
arms
and
formally
formed
permanent
ties

barbarous

gave
the
feudal

every

softened
stranger
and
enemy
seemed
to
be
synonymous
and
crusaders

the
chroniclers
of
the
times
divided
by
language
seemed
to
form
only
one
people
by
their
love
for

their
neighbor

without
coloring
the
picture
too
warmly
and
making
all
due
allowance
for
the
exaggerations
which
were
so
natural
to
the

of

a
movement
we
may
say
that

pass

the
painful
period
of
organization

one
of

accomplishment
is
indeed
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
surprising
in
the
whole
story
of
the
time
it
is
usually
considered
that
the
teaching
supposed
to
have
been
more
or
less
generally
accepted
that
the
antipodes
did
not
exist
prevented
any
significant
development
of
geography
until
comparatively
modern
times
while
the
question
of
the
existence
of
antipodes
was
discussed
in
the
schools
of
the
middle
ages
and
especially
of
the
thirteenth
century
when
men
minds
were
occupied
with
practically
all
of
the
important
problems
even
of
physical
science
and
while
many
intelligent
men
accepted
the
idea
that
there
could
not
be
inhabitants
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
because
of
physical
difficulties
which
supposedly
made
it
impossible
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
think
that
this
idea
was
universally
accepted
we
have
already
called
attention
to
the
fact
in
the
chapter
on
what
was
taught
at
the
universities
that
albertus
magnus
for
instance
ridiculed
the
notion
that
men
could
not
live
with
their
heads
down
as
was
urged
against
the
doctrine
of
the
existence
of
antipodes
by
suggesting
very
simply
that
for
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
what
we
call
down
was
really
not
down
but
up
this
expresses
of
course
the
very
heart
of
the
solution
of
the
supposed
difficulty
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
seems
clear
that
many
of
the
great
travelers
and
explorers
of
the
later
middle
ages
harbored
the
notion
that
the
earth
was
round
as
we
shall
note
a
little
later
in
mentioning
sir
john
mandeville
work
the
writer
whomever
he
was
who
took
that
pseudonym
believed
thoroughly
in
the
rotundity
of
the
earth
and
did
not
hesitate
to
use
some
striking
expressions
which
have
been
often
quoted
that
he
had
heard
of
travelers
who
by
traveling
continually
to
the
eastward
had
come
back
eventually
to
the
point
from
which
they
started
while
in
the
schools
then
the
existence
of
antipodes
may
have
been
under
discussion
there
was
a
practical
acceptance
of
their
existence
among
those
who
were
better
informed
with
regard
to
countries
and
peoples
and
all
the
other
topics
which
form
the
proper
subject
matter
of
geography
it
must
be
realized
moreover
that
though
the
existence
of
the
antipodes
is
an
important
matter
in
geography
at
this
early
period
it
was
a
mere
theory
not
a
condition
antecedent
to
progress
it
was
really
a
side
issue
as
compared
with
many
other
questions
relating
to
the
earth
surface
and
its
inhabitants
with
which
the
medieval
mind
was
occupied
to
consider
that
no
knowledge
of
geography
could
be
obtained
until
there
was
a
definite
acceptance
of
the
right
view
of
the
earth
surface
would
be
to
obliterate
much
precious
knowledge
the
argument
as
to
the
existence
of
antipodes
as
it
was
carried
on
was
entirely
outside
of
geography
properly
it
never
influenced
in
the
slightest
degree
the
men
who
were
consciously
and
unconsciously
laying
deep
and
broad
the
foundations
of
modern
geography
to
consider
such
a
matter
as
vital
to
the
development
of
as
many
sided
a
subject
as
geography
illustrates
very
typically
the
narrowness
of
view
of
so
many
modern
scholars
who
apparently
can
see
the
value
of
nothing
which
does
not
entirely
accord
with
modern
knowledge
the
really
interesting
historian
of
knowledge
however
is
he
who
can
point
out
the
beginnings
of
what
we
now
know
in
unexpected
quarters
in
the
medieval
mind
as
the
story
of
these
travels
and
explorations
is
really
a
glorious
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
encouragement
of
things
intellectual
as
well
as
an
interesting
phase
of
an
important
origin
whose
foundations
were
laid
broad
and
deep
in
the
thirteenth
century
it
must
be
told
here
in
some
detail
our
century
was
the
great
leader
in
exploration
and
geography
as
in
so
many
other
matters
in
which
its
true
place
is
often
unrecognized
the
people
of
the
time
are
usually
considered
to
have
had
such
few
facilities
for
travel
that
they
did
not
often
go
far
from
home
and
that
what
was
known
about
distant
countries
therefore
was
very
little
and
mainly
legendary
nothing
could
be
more
false
than
any
such
impression
as
this
the
crusades
during
the
previous
century
had
given
the
people
not
only
a
deep
interest
in
distant
lands
but
the
curiosity
to
go
and
see
for
themselves
pilgrimages
to
the
holy
land
were
frequent
ecclesiastics
often
traveled
at
least
as
far
as
italy
and
in
general
the
tide
of
travel
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
population
must
have
been
not
very
much
less
in
amount
than
in
our
own
day
after
the
establishment
of
the
religious
orders
missionary
expeditions
to
the
east
became
very
common
and
during
the
thirteenth
century
as
we
shall
see
the
franciscans
particularly
established
themselves
in
many
parts
of
the
near
east
but
also
of
the
far
east
especially
in
china
many
of
those
wrote
accounts
of
their
travels
and
so
the
literature
of
travel
and
exploration
during
the
thirteenth
century
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
chapters
of
the
literature
of
these
times
while
the
wonderfully
deep
foundations
that
were
laid
for
the
science
of
geography
are
worthy
to
be
set
beside
the
great
origins
in
other
sciences
and
in
the
arts
for
which
the
century
is
so
noteworthy
to
most
people
it
will
come
as
a
distinct
surprise
to
learn
that
the
travelers
and
explorers
of
the
thirteenth
century
merchants
ambassadors
and
missionaries
succeeded
in
solving
many
of
the
geographical
problems
that
have
been
of
deepest
interest
to
the
generations
of
the
last
half
of
last
century
the
eastern
part
of
asia
particularly
was
traveled
over
and
very
thoroughly
described
by
them
even
the
northern
part
of
india
however
was
not
neglected
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
that
were
encountered
and
thibet
was
explored
and
lhasa
entered
by
travelers
of
the
thirteenth
century
of
china
as
much
was
written
as
had
been
learned
by
succeeding
generations
down
practically
to
our
own
time
this
may
sound
like
a
series
of
instead
of
serious
science
but
it
is
the
travelers
and
explorers
of
the
modern
time
who
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
comment
on
the
writings
of
these
wanderers
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
who
have
pointed
out
the
significance
of
their
work
these
men
described
not
only
the
countries
through
which
they
passed
but
also
the
characters
of
the
people
their
habits
and
customs
their
forms
of
speech
with
many
marvelous
hints
as
regards
the
relationship
of
the
different
languages
and
even
something
about
the
religious
practises
of
these
countries
and
their
attitude
toward
the
great
truths
of
christianity
when
they
were
presented
to
them
undoubtedly
one
of
the
greatest
travelers
and
explorers
of
all
times
was
marco
polo
whose
book
was
for
so
long
considered
to
be
mainly
made
up
of
imaginary
descriptions
of
things
and
places
never
seen
but
which
the
development
of
modern
geographical
science
by
travels
and
expeditions
has
proved
to
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
contributions
to
this
department
of
knowledge
that
has
ever
been
made
it
took
many
centuries
for
marco
polo
to
come
to
his
own
in
this
respect
but
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
have
almost
more
than
made
up
for
the
neglect
of
their
predecessors
marco
polo
suffered
the
same
fate
as
did
herodotus
of
whom
voltaire
sneered
father
of
history
say
rather
father
of
lies
so
long
as
succeeding
generations
had
no
knowledge
themselves
of
the
things
of
which
both
these
great
writers
had
written
they
were
distrusted
and
even
treated
contemptuously
just
as
soon
however
as
definite
knowledge
began
to
come
it
was
seen
how
wonderfully
accurate
both
of
them
were
in
their
descriptions
of
things
they
had
actually
seen
though
they
admitted
certain
stories
on
the
authority
of
others
herodotus
has
now
come
to
be
acknowledged
as
one
of
the
greatest
of
historians
in
his
lives
of
celebrated
travelers
james
augustus
john
states
the
change
of
mind
with
regard
to
marco
polo
rather
forcibly
when
the
travels
of
marco
polo
first
appeared
they
were
generally
regarded
as
fiction
and
as
this
absurd
belief
had
so
far
gained
ground
that
when
he
lay
upon
his
death
bed
his
friends
and
nearest
relatives
coming
to
take
their
eternal
adieu
conjured
him
as
he
valued
the
salvation
of
his
soul
to
retract
whatever
he
had
advanced
in
his
book
or
at
least
many
such
passages
as
every
person
looked
upon
as
untrue
but
the
traveler
whose
conscience
was
untouched
upon
that
score
declared
solemnly
in
that
awful
moment
that
far
from
being
guilty
of
exaggeration
he
had
not
described
of
the
wonderful
things
which
he
had
beheld
such
was
the
reception
which
the
discoveries
of
this
extraordinary
man
experienced
when
first
promulgated
by
degrees
however
as
enterprise
lifted
more
and
more
the
veil
from
central
and
eastern
asia
the
relations
of
our
traveler
rose
in
the
estimation
of
geographers
and
now
that
the
world
though
containing
many
unknown
tracts
has
been
more
successfully
explored
we
begin
to
perceive
that
marco
polo
like
herodotus
was
a
man
of
the
most
rigid
veracity
whose
testimony
presumptuous
ignorance
alone
can
call
in
question
there
is
many
a
fable
that
clings
around
the
name
of
marco
polo
but
this
distinguished
traveler
needs
no
fictitious
adornments
of
his
tale
to
make
him
one
of
the
greatest
explorers
of
all
time
it
is
sometimes
said
that
he
helped
to
introduce
many
important
inventions
into
europe
and
one
even
finds
his
name
connected
with
the
mariner
compass
and
with
gunpowder
there
are
probably
no
good
grounds
for
thinking
that
europe
owes
any
knowledge
of
either
of
these
great
inventions
to
the
venetian
traveler
with
regard
to
printing
there
is
more
doubt
and
polo
passage
with
regard
to
movable
blocks
for
printing
paper
money
as
used
in
china
may
have
proved
suggestive
there
is
no
need
however
of
surmises
in
order
to
increase
his
fame
for
the
simple
story
of
his
travels
is
quite
sufficient
for
his
reputation
for
all
time
as
has
been
well
said
most
of
the
modern
travelers
and
explorers
have
only
been
developing
what
polo
indicated
at
least
in
outline
and
they
have
been
scarcely
more
than
describing
with
more
precision
of
detail
what
he
first
touched
upon
and
brought
to
general
notice
when
it
is
remembered
that
he
visited
such
cities
in
eastern
turkestan
as
kashgar
yarkand
and
khotan
which
have
been
the
subject
of
much
curiosity
only
satisfied
in
quite
recent
years
that
he
had
visited
thibet
or
at
least
had
traveled
along
its
frontier
that
to
him
the
medieval
world
owed
some
definite
knowledge
of
the
christian
kingdom
of
abyssinia
and
all
that
it
was
to
know
of
china
for
centuries
almost
his
merits
will
be
readily
appreciated
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
scarcely
an
interesting
country
of
the
east
of
which
marco
polo
did
not
have
something
to
relate
from
his
personal
experiences
he
told
of
burmah
of
siam
of
cochin
china
of
japan
of
java
of
sumatra
and
of
other
islands
of
the
great
archipelago
of
ceylon
and
of
india
and
all
of
these
not
in
the
fabulous
dreamland
spirit
of
one
who
has
not
been
in
contact
with
the
east
but
in
very
definite
and
precise
fashion
nor
was
this
all
he
had
heard
and
could
tell
much
though
his
geographical
lore
was
legendary
and
rather
dim
of
the
coast
of
zanzibar
of
the
vast
and
distant
madagascar
and
in
the
remotely
opposite
direction
of
siberia
of
the
shores
of
the
arctic
ocean
and
of
the
curious
customs
of
the
inhabitants
of
these
distant
countries
how
wonderfully
acute
and
yet
how
thoroughly
practical
some
of
observations
were
can
be
best
appreciated
by
some
quotations
from
his
description
of
products
and
industries
as
he
saw
them
on
his
travels
we
are
apt
to
think
of
the
use
of
petroleum
as
dating
from
much
later
than
the
thirteenth
century
but
marco
polo
had
not
only
seen
it
in
the
near
east
on
his
travels
but
evidently
had
learned
much
of
the
great
deposits
at
baku
which
constitute
the
basis
for
the
important
russian
petroleum
industry
in
modern
times
he
says
on
the
north
of
armenia
is
found
a
fountain
from
which
a
liquor
like
oil
flows
which
though
unprofitable
for
the
seasoning
of
meat
is
good
for
burning
and
for
anointing
camels
afflicted
with
the
mange
this
oil
flows
constantly
and
copiously
so
that
camels
are
laden
with
it
he
is
quite
as
definite
in
the
information
acquired
with
regard
to
the
use
of
coal
he
knew
and
states
very
confidently
that
there
were
immense
deposits
of
coal
in
china
deposits
which
are
so
extensive
that
distinguished
geologists
and
mineralogists
who
have
learned
of
them
in
modern
times
have
predicted
that
eventually
the
world
great
manufacturing
industries
would
be
transferred
to
china
we
are
apt
to
think
that
this
mineral
wealth
is
not
exploited
by
the
chinese
yet
even
in
marco
polo
time
as
one
commentator
has
remarked
the
rich
and
poor
of
that
land
had
learned
the
value
of
the
black
stone
through
the
whole
province
of
cathay
says
polo
certain
black
stones
are
dug
from
the
mountains
which
put
into
the
fire
burn
like
wood
and
being
kindled
preserve
fire
a
long
time
and
if
they
be
kindled
in
the
evening
they
keep
fire
all
the
night
another
important
mineral
product
which
even
more
than
petroleum
or
coal
is
supposed
to
be
essentially
modern
in
its
employment
is
asbestos
polo
had
not
only
seen
this
but
had
realized
exactly
what
it
was
had
found
out
its
origin
and
had
recognized
its
value
curiously
enough
he
attempts
to
explain
the
origin
of
a
peculiar
usage
of
the
word
salamander
the
salamander
having
been
supposed
to
be
an
animal
which
was
not
injured
by
fire
by
reference
to
the
incombustibility
of
asbestos
the
whole
passage
as
it
appears
in
the
romance
of
travel
and
exploration
deserves
to
be
quoted
while
discoursing
about
dsungaria
polo
says
and
you
must
know
that
in
the
mountain
there
is
a
substance
from
which
salamander
is
made
the
real
truth
is
that
the
salamander
is
no
beast
as
they
allege
in
our
part
of
the
world
but
is
a
substance
found
in
the
earth
everybody
can
be
aware
that
it
can
be
no
animal
nature
to
live
in
fire
seeing
that
every
animal
is
composed
of
all
the
four
elements
now
i
marco
polo
had
a
turkish
acquaintance
who
related
that
he
had
lived
three
years
in
that
region
on
behalf
of
the
great
khan
in
order
to
procure
these
salamanders
for
him
he
said
that
the
way
they
got
them
was
by
digging
in
that
mountain
till
they
found
a
certain
vein
the
substance
of
this
vein
was
taken
and
crushed
and
when
so
treated
it
divides
as
it
were
into
fibres
of
wool
which
they
set
forth
to
dry
when
dry
these
fibres
were
pounded
in
a
copper
mortar
and
then
washed
so
as
to
remove
all
the
earth
and
to
leave
only
the
fibres
like
fibres
of
wool
these
were
then
spun
and
made
into
napkins
needless
to
say
this
is
an
excellent
description
of
asbestos
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
the
twentieth
century
so
interested
in
travel
and
exploration
should
be
ready
to
lay
its
tributes
at
the
feet
of
marco
polo
and
that
one
of
the
important
book
announcements
of
recent
years
should
be
that
of
the
publication
of
an
annotated
edition
of
marco
polo
from
the
hands
of
a
modern
explorer
who
considered
that
there
was
no
better
way
of
putting
definitely
before
the
public
in
its
true
historical
aspect
the
evolution
of
modern
geographical
knowledge
with
regard
to
eastern
countries
it
can
scarcely
fail
to
be
surprising
to
the
modern
mind
that
polo
should
practically
have
been
forced
into
print
he
had
none
of
the
itch
of
the
modern
traveler
for
publicity
the
story
of
his
travels
he
had
often
told
and
because
of
the
wondrous
tales
he
could
unfold
and
the
large
numbers
he
found
it
frequently
so
necessary
to
use
in
order
to
give
proper
ideas
of
some
of
his
wanderings
had
acquired
the
nickname
of
marco
millioni
he
had
never
thought
however
of
committing
his
story
to
writing
or
perhaps
he
feared
the
drudgery
of
such
literary
labor
after
his
return
from
his
travels
however
he
bravely
accepted
a
patriot
duty
of
fighting
for
his
native
country
on
board
one
of
her
galleys
and
was
captured
by
the
genoese
in
a
famous
in
the
adriatic
in
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
remained
in
captivity
in
genoa
for
nearly
a
year
it
was
during
this
time
that
one
rusticiano
a
writer
by
profession
was
attracted
to
him
and
tempted
him
to
tell
him
the
complete
story
of
his
travels
in
order
that
they
might
be
put
into
connected
form
rusticiano
was
a
pisan
who
had
been
a
compiler
of
french
romances
and
accordingly
polo
story
was
first
told
in
french
prose
it
is
not
surprising
that
rusticiano
should
have
chosen
french
since
he
naturally
wished
his
story
of
polo
travels
to
be
read
by
as
many
people
as
possible
and
realized
that
it
would
be
of
quite
as
much
interest
to
ordinary
folk
as
to
the
literary
circles
of
europe
how
interesting
the
story
is
only
those
who
have
read
it
even
with
the
knowledge
acquired
by
all
the
other
explorers
since
his
time
can
properly
appreciate
it
lacks
entirely
the
egotistic
quality
that
usually
characterizes
an
explorer
account
of
his
travels
and
indeed
there
can
scarcely
fail
to
be
something
of
disappointment
because
of
this
fact
no
doubt
a
touch
more
of
personal
adventure
would
have
added
to
the
interest
of
the
book
it
was
not
a
characteristic
of
the
thirteenth
century
however
to
insist
on
the
merely
personal
and
consequently
the
world
has
lost
a
treat
it
might
otherwise
have
had
there
is
no
question
however
or
the
greatness
of
polo
work
as
a
traveler
nor
of
the
glory
that
was
shed
by
it
on
the
thirteenth
century
like
nearly
everything
else
that
was
done
in
this
marvelous
century
he
represents
the
acme
of
successful
endeavor
in
his
special
line
down
even
to
our
own
time
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
marco
polo
work
greatly
influenced
columbus
and
encouraged
him
in
his
attempt
to
seek
india
by
sailing
around
the
globe
of
this
however
there
is
considerable
doubt
we
have
learned
in
recent
times
that
a
very
definite
tradition
with
regard
to
the
possibility
of
finding
land
by
sailing
straight
westward
over
the
atlantic
existed
long
before
columbus
time
footnote
polo
indirect
influence
on
columbus
by
his
creation
of
an
interest
in
geographical
matters
generally
is
much
clearer
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
how
much
his
work
succeeded
in
drawing
men
minds
to
geographical
questions
during
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
footnote
my
learned
friend
father
deroo
of
portland
who
has
written
two
very
interesting
volumes
on
the
history
of
america
before
columbus
does
not
hesitate
to
say
that
columbus
may
even
have
met
in
his
travels
and
spoken
with
sailors
who
had
touched
on
some
portions
of
the
american
continent
and
that
of
course
the
traditions
with
regard
to
greenland
were
very
clear
after
marco
polo
undoubtedly
the
most
enterprising
explorer
and
interesting
writer
on
travel
in
the
thirteenth
century
was
john
of
carpini
the
author
of
a
wonderful
series
of
descriptions
of
things
seen
in
northern
asia
like
so
many
other
travelers
and
explorers
at
this
time
john
was
a
franciscan
friar
and
seems
to
have
been
one
of
the
early
companions
and
disciples
of
francis
of
assisi
whom
he
joined
when
he
was
only
a
young
man
himself
before
going
on
his
missionary
and
ambassadorial
expedition
he
had
been
one
of
the
most
prominent
men
in
the
order
he
had
much
to
do
with
its
propagation
among
the
northern
nations
of
europe
and
occupied
successively
the
offices
of
custos
or
prior
in
saxony
and
of
provincial
in
germany
he
seems
afterwards
to
have
been
sent
as
an
organizer
into
spain
and
to
have
gone
even
as
far
as
the
barbary
coast
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
when
in
pope
innocent
iv
sometime
after
the
mongol
invasion
of
eastern
europe
and
the
disastrous
battle
of
legamites
which
threatened
to
place
european
civilization
and
christianity
in
the
power
of
the
tartars
resolved
to
send
a
mission
to
the
tartar
monarch
john
of
carpini
was
selected
for
the
dangerous
and
important
mission
at
this
time
friar
john
was
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
but
such
was
the
confidence
in
his
ability
and
in
his
executive
power
that
everything
on
the
embassy
was
committed
to
his
discretion
he
started
from
lyons
on
easter
day
he
sought
the
counsel
first
of
his
old
friend
wenceslaus
king
of
bohemia
and
from
that
country
took
with
him
another
friar
a
pole
to
act
as
his
interpreter
the
first
stage
in
his
journey
was
to
kiev
and
from
here
having
crossed
the
dnieper
and
the
don
to
the
volga
he
traveled
to
the
camp
of
batu
at
this
time
the
senior
living
member
of
jenghis
khan
family
batu
after
exchanging
presents
allowed
them
to
proceed
to
the
court
of
the
supreme
khan
in
mongolia
as
yule
says
the
old
man
rode
on
horseback
something
like
three
thousand
miles
in
the
next
hundred
days
the
bodies
of
himself
and
companion
had
to
be
tightly
bandaged
to
enable
them
to
stand
the
excessive
fatigue
of
this
enormous
ride
which
led
them
across
the
ural
mountains
and
river
past
the
northern
part
of
the
caspian
across
the
jaxartes
whose
name
they
could
not
find
out
along
the
dzungarian
lakes
till
they
reached
the
imperial
camp
called
the
yellow
pavilion
near
the
orkhon
river
there
had
been
an
interregnum
in
the
empire
which
was
terminated
by
a
formal
election
while
the
friars
were
at
the
yellow
pavilion
where
they
had
the
opportunity
to
see
between
three
and
four
thousand
envoys
and
deputies
from
all
parts
of
asia
and
eastern
europe
who
brought
with
them
tributes
and
presents
for
the
ruler
to
be
elected
it
was
not
for
three
months
after
this
in
november
that
the
emperor
dismissed
them
with
a
letter
to
the
pope
written
in
latin
arabic
and
mongolian
but
containing
only
a
brief
imperious
assertion
that
the
khan
of
the
tartars
was
the
scourge
of
god
for
christianity
and
that
he
must
fulfill
his
mission
then
sad
at
heart
the
ambassadors
began
their
homeward
journey
in
the
midst
of
the
winter
their
sufferings
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
but
friar
john
who
does
not
dwell
on
them
much
tells
enough
of
them
to
make
their
realization
comparatively
easy
they
reached
kiev
seven
months
later
in
june
and
were
welcomed
there
by
the
slavonic
christians
as
though
arisen
from
the
dead
from
thence
they
continued
their
journey
to
lyons
where
they
delivered
the
khan
letter
to
the
pope
friar
john
embodied
the
information
that
he
had
obtained
in
this
journey
in
a
book
that
has
been
called
liber
tartarorum
the
book
of
the
tartars
or
according
to
another
manuscript
history
of
the
mongols
whom
we
call
tartars
yule
notes
that
like
most
of
the
other
medieval
monks
itineraries
it
shows
an
entire
absence
of
that
characteristic
traveler
egotism
with
which
we
have
become
abundantly
familiar
in
more
recent
years
and
contains
very
little
personal
narrative
we
know
that
john
was
a
stout
man
and
this
in
addition
to
his
age
when
he
went
on
the
mission
can
not
but
make
us
realize
the
thoroughly
unselfish
spirit
with
which
he
followed
the
call
of
holy
obedience
to
undertake
a
work
that
seemed
sure
to
prove
fatal
and
that
would
inevitably
bring
in
its
train
suffering
of
the
severest
kind
of
the
critical
historical
value
of
his
work
a
good
idea
can
be
obtained
from
the
fact
that
half
a
century
ago
an
educated
mongol
galsang
gombeyev
in
the
historical
and
philological
bulletin
of
the
imperial
academy
of
petersburg
reviewed
the
book
and
bore
testimony
to
the
great
accuracy
of
its
statements
to
the
care
with
which
its
details
had
been
verified
and
the
evident
personal
character
of
all
its
observations
friar
john
book
attracted
the
attention
of
compilers
of
information
with
regard
to
distant
countries
very
soon
after
it
was
issued
and
an
abridgment
of
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
encyclopedia
of
vincent
of
beauvais
which
was
written
shortly
after
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
hakluyt
published
portions
of
the
original
work
as
did
borgeron
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
geographical
society
of
paris
published
a
fine
edition
of
the
work
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
at
the
same
time
a
brief
narrative
taken
down
from
the
lips
of
john
companion
friar
benedict
the
pole
which
is
somewhat
more
personal
in
its
character
and
fully
substantiates
all
that
friar
john
had
written
as
can
readily
be
understood
the
curiosity
of
his
contemporaries
was
deeply
aroused
and
friar
john
had
to
tell
his
story
many
times
after
his
return
hence
the
necessity
he
found
himself
under
of
committing
it
to
paper
so
as
to
save
himself
from
the
bother
of
telling
it
all
over
again
and
in
order
that
his
brother
franciscans
throughout
the
world
might
have
the
opportunity
to
read
it
yule
says
the
book
must
have
been
prepared
immediately
after
the
return
of
the
traveler
for
the
friar
salimbene
who
met
him
in
france
in
the
very
year
of
his
return
gives
us
these
interesting
particulars
was
a
clever
and
conversable
man
well
lettered
a
great
discourser
and
full
of
diversity
of
experience
he
wrote
a
big
book
about
the
tartars
sic
and
about
other
marvels
that
he
had
seen
and
whenever
he
felt
weary
of
telling
about
the
tartars
he
would
cause
this
book
of
his
to
be
read
as
i
have
often
heard
and
seen

another
important
traveler
of
the
thirteenth
century
whose
work
has
been
the
theme
of
praise
and
extensive
annotation
in
modern
times
was
william
of
rubruk
usually
known
under
the
name
of
rubruquis
a
franciscan
friar
thought
as
the
result
of
recent
investigations
probably
to
owe
his
cognomen
to
his
birth
in
the
little
town
of
rubruk
in
brabant
who
was
the
author
of
a
remarkable
narrative
of
asiatic
travel
during
the
thirteenth
century
and
whose
death
seems
to
have
taken
place
about
the
name
rubruquis
has
been
commonly
used
to
designate
him
because
it
is
found
in
the
latin
original
of
his
work
which
was
printed
by
hayluyt
in
his
collection
of
voyages
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
friar
william
was
sent
partly
as
an
ambassador
and
partly
as
an
explorer
by
louis
ix
of
france
into
tartary
at
that
time
the
descendants
of
jenghis
khan
ruled
over
an
immense
empire
in
the
orient
and
king
louis
was
deeply
interested
in
introducing
christianity
into
the
east
and
if
possible
making
their
rulers
christians
about
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
rumor
spread
throughout
europe
that
one
of
the
nephews
of
the
great
khan
had
embraced
christianity
louis
thought
this
a
favorable
opportunity
for
getting
in
touch
with
the
eastern
potentate
and
so
he
dispatched
at
least
two
missions
into
tartary
at
the
head
of
the
second
of
which
was
william
of
rubruk
his
accounts
of
his
travels
proved
most
interesting
reading
to
his
own
and
to
many
subsequent
generations
perhaps
to
none
more
than
our
own
the
encyclopedia
britannica
ninth
edition
says
that
the
narrative
of
his
journey
is
everywhere
full
of
life
and
interest
and
some
details
of
his
travels
will
show
the
reasons
for
this
rubruk
and
his
party
landed
on
the
crimean
coast
at
sudak
or
soldaia
a
port
which
formed
the
chief
seat
of
communication
between
the
mediterranean
countries
and
what
is
now
southern
russia
the
friar
succeeded
in
making
his
way
from
here
to
the
great
khan
court
which
was
then
held
not
far
from
karakorum
this
journey
was
one
of
several
thousand
miles
the
route
taken
has
been
worked
out
by
laborious
study
and
the
key
to
it
is
the
description
given
of
the
country
intervening
between
the
basin
of
the
talas
and
lake
this
enables
the
whole
geography
of
the
region
including
the
passage
of
the
river
ili
the
plain
south
of
the
bal
cash
and
the
itself
to
be
identified
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
the
return
journey
was
made
during
the
summertime
and
the
route
lay
much
farther
to
the
north
the
travelers
traversed
the
jabkan
valley
and
passed
north
of
the
river
bal
cash
following
a
rather
direct
course
which
led
them
to
the
mouth
of
the
volga
from
here
they
traveled
south
past
derbend
and
shamakii
to
the
uraxes
and
on
through
iconium
to
the
coast
of
cilicia
and
finally
to
the
port
of
ayas
where
they
embarked
for
cyprus
all
during
his
travels
friar
william
made
observations
on
men
and
cities
and
rivers
and
mountains
and
languages
and
customs
implements
and
utensils
and
most
of
these
modern
criticism
has
accepted
as
representing
the
actual
state
of
things
as
they
would
appear
to
a
medieval
sightseer
occasionally
during
the
period
intervening
between
his
time
and
our
own
scholars
who
thought
that
they
knew
better
have
been
conceited
enough
to
believe
themselves
in
a
position
to
point
out
glaring
errors
in
rubruquis
accounts
of
what
he
saw
subsequent
investigation
and
discovery
have
as
a
rule
proved
the
accuracy
of
the
earlier
observations
rather
than
the
modern
scholar
corrections
an
excellent
example
of
this
is
quoted
in
the
encyclopedia
britannica
article
on
rubruquis
already
referred
to

of

the
writer
says
this
sagacious
and
honest
observer
is
denounced
as
an
ignorant
and
untruthful
blunderer
by
isaac
jacob
schmidt
a
man
no
doubt
of
useful
learning
of
a
kind
rare
in
his
day
but
narrow
and
and
in
natural
acumen
and
candour
far
inferior
to
the
thirteenth
century
friar
whom
he
maligns
simply
because
the
evidence
of
the
latter
as
to
the
turkish
dialect
of
the
uigurs
traversed
a
pet
heresy
long
since
exploded
which
schmidt
entertained
namely
that
the
uigurs
were
by
race
and
language
tibetan
some
of
the
descriptions
of
the
towns
through
which
the
travelers
passed
are
interesting
because
of
comparisons
with
towns
of
corresponding
size
in
europe
karakorum
for
instance
was
described
as
a
small
city
about
the
same
size
as
the
town
of
denis
near
paris
in
karakorum
the
ambassador
missionary
maintained
a
public
disputation
with
certain
pagan
priests
in
the
presence
of
three
of
the
secretaries
of
the
khan
the
religion
of
these
umpires
is
rather
interesting
from
its
diversity
the
first
was
a
christian
the
second
a
mohammedan
and
the
third
a
buddhist
a
very
interesting
feature
of
the
disputation
was
the
fact
that
the
khan
ordered
under
pain
of
death
that
none
of
the
disputants
should
slander
traduce
or
abuse
his
adversaries
or
endeavor
by
rumor
or
insinuations
to
excite
popular
indignation
against
them
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
great
tartar
khan
who
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
a
cruel
ignorant
despot
whose
one
quality
that
gave
him
supremacy
was
military
valor
was
really
a
large
man
his
idea
seems
to
have
been
to
discover
the
truth
of
these
different
religions
and
adopt
that
one
which
was
adjudged
to
have
the
best
groundwork
of
reason
for
it
it
is
easy
to
understand
however
that
such
a
disputation
argued
through
interpreters
wholly
ignorant
of
the
subject
and
without
any
proper
understanding
of
the
nice
distinctions
of
words
or
any
practise
in
conveying
their
proper
significance
could
come
to
no
serious
conclusion
the
arguments
therefore
fell
flat
and
a
decision
was
not
rendered
friar
william
work
was
not
unappreciated
by
his
contemporaries
and
even
its
scientific
value
was
thoroughly
realized
it
is
not
surprising
of
course
that
his
great
contemporary
in
the
franciscan
order
roger
bacon
should
have
come
to
the
knowledge
of
his
brother
minorite
book
and
should
have
made
frequent
and
copious
quotations
from
it
in
the
geographical
section
of
his
opus
majus
which
was
written
some
time
during
the
seventh
decade
of
the
thirteenth
century
bacon
says
that
brother
william
traversed
the
oriental
and
northern
regions
and
the
places
adjacent
to
them
and
wrote
accounts
of
them
for
the
illustrious
king
of
france
who
sent
him
on
the
expedition
to
tartary
he
adds
i
have
read
his
book
diligently
and
have
compared
it
with
similar
accounts
roger
bacon
recognized
by
a
sort
of
scientific
intuition
of
his
own
certain
passages
which
have
proved
to
be
the
best
in
recent
times
the
description
for
instance
of
the
caspian
was
the
best
down
to
this
time
and
friar
william
corrects
the
error
made
by
isidore
and
which
had
generally
been
accepted
before
this
that
the
caspian
sea
was
a
gulf
rubruk
as
quoted
by
roger
bacon
states
very
explicitly
that
it
nowhere
touches
the
ocean
but
is
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
land
for
those
who
do
not
think
that
the
foundations
of
scientific
geography
were
laid
until
recent
times
a
little
consultation
of
roger
bacon
opus
majus
would
undoubtedly
be
a
revelation
it
is
probably
with
regard
to
language
that
one
might
reasonably
expect
to
find
least
that
would
be
of
interest
to
modern
scholars
in
friar
william
book
as
might
easily
have
been
gathered
from
previous
references
however
it
is
here
that
the
most
frequent
surprises
as
to
the
acuity
of
this
medieval
traveler
await
the
modern
reader
scientific
philology
is
so
much
a
product
of
the
last
century
that
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
this
missionary
was
able
to
reach
so
many
almost
intuitive
recognitions
of
the
origin
and
relationships
of
the
languages
of
the
people
among
whom
he
traveled
he
came
in
contact
with
the
group
of
nations
occupying
what
is
now
known
as
the
near
east
whose
languages
as
is
well
known
have
constituted
a
series
of
the
most
difficult
problems
with
which
philology
had
to
deal
until
its
thorough
establishment
on
scientific
lines
enabled
it
to
separate
them
properly
it
is
all
the
more
surprising
then
to
find
that
friar
william
should
have
so
much
in
his
book
that
even
the
modern
philologist
will
read
with
attention
and
unstinted
admiration
with
regard
to
this
colonel
yule
whose
personal
experience
makes
him
a
valuable
guide
in
such
matters
has
written
a
paragraph
which
contains
so
much
compressed
information
that
we
venture
to
quote
it
entire
it
furnishes
the
grounds
for
the
claim
which
might
seem
overstrained
if
it
were
not
that
its
author
was
himself
one
of
the
greatest
of
modern
explorers
that
william
was
an
acute
and
most
intelligent
observer
keen
in
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
the
author
in
fact
of
one
of
the
best
narratives
of
travel
in
existence
yule
says
of
his
interest
and
acumen
in
matters
of
language
we
may
cite
examples
the
language
of
the
pascatir
or
bashkirds
and
of
the
hungarians
is
the
same
as
he
had
learned
from
dominicans
who
had
been
among
them
the
language
of
the
ruthenians
poles
bohemians
and
slavonians
is
one
and
is
the
same
with
that
of
the
wandals
or
wends
in
the
town
of
equinus
immediately
beyond
the
ili
perhaps
aspara
the
people
were
mohammedans
speaking
persian
though
so
far
remote
from
persia
the
yugurs
or
uigurs
of
the
country
about
the
cailac
had
formed
a
language
and
character
of
their
own
and
in
that
language
and
character
the
nestorians
of
that
tract
used
to
perform
their
office
and
write
their
books
the
yugurs
are
those
among
whom
are
found
the
fountain
and
root
of
the
turkish
and
comanian
tongue
their
character
has
been
adopted
by
the
moghals
in
using
it
they
begin
writing
from
the
top
and
write
downwards
whilst
line
follows
line
from
left
to
right
the
nestorians
say
their
service
and
have
their
holy
book
in
syriac
but
know
nothing
of
the
language
just
as
some
of
our
monks
sing
the
mass
without
knowing
latin
the
tibet
people
write
as
we
do
and
their
letters
have
a
strong
resemblance
to
ours
the
tangut
people
write
from
right
to
left
like
the
arabs
and
their
lines
advance
upwards
there
were
other
matters
besides
language
and
religion
on
which
friar
william
made
observations
and
though
his
book
is
eminently
human
giving
us
a
very
interesting
view
of
his
own
personality
and
of
his
difficulties
with
his
dragoman
which
many
a
modern
eastern
traveler
will
sympathize
with
and
a
picture
that
includes
the
detail
that
he
was
a
very
heavy
man
which
makes
his
travel
on
horseback
for
some
miles
all
the
more
wonderful
it
also
contains
a
mass
of
particulars
marvelously
true
or
so
near
the
truth
as
to
be
almost
more
interesting
as
to
asiatic
nature
ethnography
manners
morals
commercial
customs
and
nearly
everything
else
relating
to
the
life
of
the
peoples
among
whom
he
traveled
a
typical
example
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
following
suggestive
paragraph
the
current
money
of
cathay
is
of
cotton
paper
a
palm
in
length
and
breath
and
on
this
they
print
lines
like
those
of
mangu
khan
seal
lineas
sicut
est
sigillum
mangu
a
remarkable
expression
they
write
with
a
painter
pencil
and
combine
in
one
character
several
letters
forming
one
expression
in
una
figura
plures
literas
comprehendentes
unam
dictionem
a
still
more
remarkable
utterance
showing
an
approximate
apprehension
of
the
nature
of
chinese
writing
there
are
other
distinguished
travelers
whose
inspiration
came
to
them
during
the
thirteenth
century
though
their
works
were
published
in
the
early
part
of
the
next
century
some
of
these
we
know
mainly
through
their
adaptation
and
incorporation
into
his
work
without
due
recognition
by
that
first
great
writer
of
spurious
travels
sir
john
mandeville
mandeville
work
was
probably
written
some
time
during
the
early
part
of
the
second
half
of
the
fourteenth
century
but
he
used
materials
gathered
from
travelers
of
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
next
his
own
century
sir
henry
yule
has
pointed
out
that
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
supposed
more
distant
travels
of
sir
john
mandeville
were
appropriated
from
the
narrative
of
friar
odoric
a
monk
who
became
a
member
of
the
franciscan
order
about
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
whose
travels
as
a
missionary
in
the
east
gave
him
the
opportunities
to
collect
a
precious
fund
of
information
which
is
contained
in
famous
story
of
his
voyages
of
odoric
himself
we
shall
have
something
to
say
presently
in
the
meantime
it
seems
well
worth
while
calling
to
attention
that
the
accepted
narrative
of
sir
john
mandeville
as
it
is
called
and
which
may
have
been
written
by
a
physician
of
the
name
of
john
of
burgoigne
under
an
assumed
name
contains
a
number
of
interesting
anticipations
of
facts
that
were
supposed
to
enter
into
the
domain
of
human
knowledge
much
later
in
the
intellectual
development
of
the
race
in
certain
passages
and
especially
in
one
which
is
familiar
from
its
being
cited
by
johnson
in
the
preface
to
his
dictionary
mandeville
to
use
the
name
under
which
the
story
is
best
known
shows
that
he
had
a
correct
idea
of
the
form
of
the
earth
and
of
position
in
latitude
as
it
could
be
ascertained
by
observation
of
the
pole
star
he
knew
also
as
we
noted
at
the
beginning
of
this
article
that
there
are
antipodes
and
if
ships
were
sent
on
voyages
of
discovery
they
might
sail
around
the
world
as
yule
has
pointed
out
mandeville
tells
a
curious
story
which
he
had
heard
in
his
youth
of
how
a
worthy
man
did
travel
ever
eastward
until
he
came
to
his
own
country
again
odoric
of
whom
we
have
already
spoken
must
be
considered
as
the
next
great
missionary
traveler
of
this
age
he
took
franciscan
vows
when
scarcely
a
boy
and
was
encouraged
to
travel
in
the
east
by
the
example
of
his
holy
father
francis
and
also
by
the
interest
and
missionary
zeal
to
convert
the
east
which
had
been
aroused
by
marco
polo
travels
his
long
journeys
will
be
more
readily
understood
however
if
we
realize
as
is
stated
in
the
article
on
him
in
the
encyclopedia
britannica
an
authority
that
will
surely
be
unsuspected
of
too
great
partiality
for
the
work
of
catholic
missionaries
that
there
had
risen
also
during
the
latter
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
an
energetic
missionary
action
extending
all
over
the
east
on
the
part
of
both
the
new
orders
of
preaching
and
minorite
or
dominican
and
franciscan
friars
which
had
caused
members
of
these
orders
of
the
last
especially
to
become
established
in
persia
and
what
is
now
southern
russia
in
tartary
and
in
china
in
the
course
of
his
travels
in
the
east
odoric
visited
malabar
touching
at
pandarini
twenty
miles
north
of
calicut
at
craganore
and
at
quilon
preceding
thence
apparently
to
ceylon
and
to
the
shrine
of
thomas
at
mailapur
near
madras
even
more
interesting
than
his
travels
in
india
however
are
those
in
china
he
sailed
from
the
hindustan
peninsula
in
a
chinese
junk
to
sumatra
visiting
various
ports
on
the
northern
coast
of
that
island
and
telling
something
about
the
inhabitants
and
the
customs
of
the
country
according
to
sir
henry
yule
he
then
visited
java
and
it
would
seem
also
the
coast
of
borneo
finally
reaching
kanton
at
that
time
known
to
western
asiatics
as
chin
kalan
or
great
china
from
there
he
went
to
the
great
ports
of
fuhkeen
and
schwan
chow
where
he
found
two
houses
of
his
order
thence
he
proceeded
to
fuchau
from
which
place
he
struck
across
the
mountains
into
chekaeng
and
then
visited
hang
chow
at
that
time
renowned
under
the
name
of
cansay
modern
authorities
in
exploration
have
suggested
that
this
might
be
king
sae
the
chinese
name
for
royal
residence
which
was
then
one
of
the
greatest
cities
of
the
world
thence
odoric
passed
northward
by
nanking
and
crossing
the
great
kiang
embarked
on
the
grand
canal
and
traveled
to
cambaluc
or
pekin
where
he
remained
for
three
years
and
where
it
is
thought
that
he
was
attached
to
one
of
the
churches
founded
by
archbishop
john
of
monte
corvino
who
was
at
this
time
in
extreme
old
age
the
most
surprising
part
of
odoric
travels
were
still
to
come
when
the
fever
for
traveling
came
upon
him
again
he
turned
almost
directly
westward
to
the
great
wall
and
through
shenshua
from
here
the
adventurous
traveler
we
are
still
practically
quoting
sir
henry
yule
entered
thibet
and
appears
to
have
visited
lhasa
considering
how
much
of
interest
has
been
aroused
by
recent
attempts
to
enter
lhasa
and
the
surprising
adventures
that
men
have
gone
through
in
the
effort
the
success
of
this
medieval
monk
in
such
an
expedition
would
seem
incredible
if
it
were
not
substantiated
by
documents
that
place
the
matter
beyond
all
doubt
even
in
the
minds
of
the
most
distinguished
modern
authorities
in
geography
and
exploration
how
odoric
returned
home
is
not
definitely
known
though
certain
fragmentary
notices
seem
to
indicate
that
he
passed
through
khorasan
and
probably
tabriz
to
europe
it
only
remains
to
complete
the
interest
of
odoric
wondrous
tale
to
add
that
during
a
large
portion
of
these
years
long
journeys
his
companion
was
friar
james
an
irishman
who
had
been
attracted
to
italy
in
order
to
become
a
franciscan
as
appears
from
a
record
in
the
public
books
of
the
town
of
udine
in
italy
where
the
monastery
of
which
both
he
and
odoric
were
members
was
situated
a
present
of
two
marks
was
made
by
the
municipal
authorities
to
the
irish
friar
shortly
after
odoric
death
the
reason
for
the
gift
was
stated
to
be
that
friar
james
had
been
for
the
love
of
god
and
of
odoric
a
typical
celtic
expression
and
characteristic
a
companion
of
the
blessed
odoric
in
his
wanderings
unfortunately
odoric
died
within
two
years
after
his
return
though
not
until
the
story
of
his
travels
had
been
taken
down
in
homely
latin
by
friar
william
of
bologna
shortly
after
his
death
odoric
became
an
object
of
reverence
on
the
part
of
his
brother
friars
and
of
devotion
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
recognized
the
wonderful
apostolic
spirit
that
he
had
displayed
in
his
long
wanderings
and
the
patience
and
with
which
he
had
borne
sufferings
and
hardships
for
the
sake
of
winning
the
souls
of
those
outside
the
church
sir
henry
yule
summed
up
his
opinion
of
odoric
in
the
following
striking
passage
which
bears
forcible
testimony
also
to
the
healthy
curiosity
of
the
times
with
regard
to
all
these
original
sources
of
information
which
were
recognized
as
valuable
because
first
hand
the
numerous
mss
of
odoric
narrative
that
have
come
down
to
our
time
upwards
of
forty
are
known
and
chiefly
from
the
fourteenth
century
show
how
speedily
and
widely
it
acquired
popularity
it
does
not
deserve
the
charge
of
general
mendacity
brought
up
against
it
by
some
though
the
language
of
other
writers
who
have
spoken
of
the
traveler
as
a
man
of
learning
is
still
more
injudicious
like
most
of
the
medieval
travelers
he
is
indiscriminating
in
accepting
strange
tales
but
while
some
of
these
are
the
habitual
stories
of
the
age
many
particulars
which
he
recited
attest
the
genuine
character
of
the
narrative
and
some
of
those
which
tiraboschi
and
others
have
condemned
as
mendacious
interpolations
are
the
very
seals
of
truth
besides
odoric
there
is
another
monkish
traveler
from
whom
mandeville
has
borrowed
much
though
without
giving
him
any
credit
this
is
the
praemonstratensian
monk
hayton
who
is
said
to
have
been
a
member
of
a
princely
armenian
family
and
who
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
dictated
a
work
on
the
affairs
of
the
orient
and
especially
the
history
of
the
nearer
east
in
his
own
time
of
which
from
the
place
of
his
nativity
and
bringing
up
he
had
abundant
information
while
he
found
all
round
him
in
france
where
he
was
living
at
the
time
the
greatest
thirst
for
knowledge
with
regard
to
this
part
of
the
world
his
book
seems
to
have
been
dictated
originally
in
french
at
poictiers
and
to
have
attracted
great
attention
because
of
its
subject
many
copies
of
it
being
made
as
well
as
translations
into
other
languages
within
a
few
years
after
its
original
appearance
the
story
of
odoric
is
a
forcible
reminder
of
how
much
the
missionaries
accomplished
for
geography
ethnology
and
ethnography
in
the
thirteenth
century
as
they
did
in
succeeding
centuries
if
what
the
missionaries
have
added
to
these
sciences
were
to
have
been
lost
there
would
have
been
enormous
gaps
in
the
knowledge
with
which
modern
scholars
began
their
scientific
labors
in
philology
it
may
be
a
surprise
to
most
people
moreover
to
be
thus
forcibly
reminded
of
the
wonderful
evangelizing
spirit
which
characterized
the
later
middle
age
needless
to
say
these
graduates
of
the
thirteenth
century
universities
who
wandered
in
distant
eastern
lands
brought
with
them
their
european
culture
for
the
uplifting
of
the
orientals
and
brought
back
to
europe
many
ideas
that
were
to
be
fruitful
sources
of
suggestions
not
only
for
geographical
ethnological
philological
and
other
departments
of
learning
but
also
in
manufactures
and
in
arts
we
mentioned
the
fact
that
odoric
in
his
travels
eventually
reached
cambaluc
or
pekin
where
he
found
archbishop
john
of
monte
corvino
still
alive
though
at
an
advanced
age
and
was
probably
attached
for
the
three
years
of
his
stay
to
one
of
the
churches
that
had
been
founded
by
this
marvelous
old
friar
who
had
been
made
archbishop
because
of
the
wonderful
power
of
organization
and
administration
displayed
during
his
earlier
career
as
a
missionary
the
story
of
this
grand
old
man
of
the
early
franciscan
missions
is
another
one
of
the
romances
of
thirteenth
century
travels
and
exploration
which
well
deserves
to
be
studied
in
detail
unfortunately
the
old
archbishop
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
work
as
a
missionary
and
an
ecclesiastic
to
return
to
europe
in
order
to
tell
of
it
or
to
write
any
lengthy
account
of
his
experiences
like
many
another
great
man
of
the
thirteenth
century
he
was
a
doer
and
not
a
writer
and
but
for
the
casual
mention
of
him
by
others
the
records
of
his
deeds
would
only
be
found
in
certain
ecclesiastical
records
and
his
work
would
now
be
known
to
the
master
alone
for
whom
it
was
so
unselfishly
done
it
will
be
noted
that
most
of
these
traveling
missionaries
were
franciscans
but
it
must
not
be
thought
that
it
was
only
the
franciscans
who
sent
out
such
missionaries
the
dominicans
established
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
also
did
wonderful
missionary
work
and
quite
as
faithfully
as
even
their
franciscan
brothers
undoubtedly
the
franciscans
surpassed
them
in
the
extent
of
their
labors
but
then
the
dominicans
were
founded
with
the
idea
of
preaching
and
uplifting
the
people
of
europe
rather
than
of
spreading
the
good
news
of
the
gospel
outside
the
bounds
of
christianity
as
it
then
existed
from
the
very
earliest
traditions
of
their
order
the
franciscans
had
their
eyes
attracted
towards
the
east
the
story
that
francis
himself
went
to
the
holy
land
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
order
to
convert
saladin
the
eastern
monarch
whose
name
has
been
made
famous
by
the
stories
of
the
crusade
in
which
richard
coeur
de
lion
took
part
has
been
doubted
but
it
seems
to
be
founded
on
too
good
contemporary
authority
to
be
considered
as
entirely
apocryphal
francis
heart
went
out
to
those
in
darkness
who
knew
nothing
of
the
christ
whom
he
had
learned
to
love
so
ardently
and
it
was
a
supreme
desire
of
his
life
that
the
good
tidings
of
christianity
should
be
spread
by
his
followers
all
over
the
world
while
they
did
this
great
work
they
accomplished
unwittingly
great
things
in
all
the
series
of
sciences
now
included
under
the
term
geography
and
gathered
precious
information
as
to
the
races
of
men
their
relations
to
one
another
and
to
the
part
of
the
earth
in
which
they
live
the
scientific
progress
thus
made
will
always
redound
largely
to
their
credit
in
the
story
of
the
intellectual
development
of
modern
europe
most
of
their
work
was
far
ahead
of
the
times
and
was
not
to
be
properly
appreciated
until
quite
recent
generations
but
this
must
only
emphasize
our
sympathy
for
those
obscure
patient
but
fruitful
workers
in
a
great
field
of
human
knowledge
as
to
what
should
be
thought
of
those
who
ignorant
of
their
work
proclaim
that
the
church
did
not
tolerate
geography
it
is
hard
to
say
our
geographical
knowledge
comes
mainly
from
travelers
whose
wish
it
is
to
gain
commercial
opportunities
for
themselves
or
their
compatriots
that
of
the
middle
ages
was
gained
by
men
who
wished
anxiously
to
spread
the
light
of
christianity
throughout
the
world
the
geographical
societies
of
these
earlier
days
were
the
religious
orders
who
sent
but
the
explorers
and
travelers
furnished
them
on
their
return
with
an
enthusiastic
audience
to
hear
their
stories
and
then
helped
to
disseminate
their
books
all
over
the
then
civilized
world
there
is
probably
no
better
refutation
of
the
expression
so
often
heard
from
those
who
know
nothing
about
it
with
regard
to
the
supposed
laziness
of
the
monks
of
the
middle
ages
than
this
chapter
of
the
story
of
their
exploration
and
missionary
labors
during
the
thirteenth
century
it
is
usually
supposed
that
if
a
monk
was
fat
he
could
not
possibly
have
accomplished
any
serious
work
in
life
some
of
these
men
were
very
weighty
yet
they
did
not
hesitate
to
take
on
themselves
these
long
journeys
to
the
east
their
lives
are
the
best
illustration
of
the
expression
of
montalembert
let
us
then
banish
into
the
world
of
fiction
that
affirmation
so
long
repeated
by
foolish
credulity
which
made
monasteries
an
asylum
for
indolence
and
incapacity
for
misanthropy
and
pusillanimity
for
feeble
and
melancholic
temperaments
and
for
men
who
were
no
longer
fit
to
serve
society
in
the
world
it
was
not
the
sick
souls
but
on
the
contrary
the
most
vigorous
and
healthful
the
human
race
has
ever
produced
who
presented
themselves
in
crowds
to
fill
them
xxvi
great
beginnings
of
modern
commerce
for
our
present
eminently
commercial
age
nothing
of
all
the
accomplishment
of
the
thirteenth
century
will
probably
possess
livelier
interest
than
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
what
must
have
seemed
insuperable
difficulties
to
a
less
enterprising
generation
the
men
of
that
time
succeeded
in
making
such
business
combinations
and
municipal
affiliations
besides
arranging
various
trade
facilities
among
distant
different
peoples
that
not
only
was
commerce
rendered
possible
and
even
easy
but
some
of
the
most
modern
developments
of
the
facilitation
of
international
intercourse
were
anticipated
the
story
of
the
rise
of
this
combination
of
many
men
of
different
nations
of
many
cities
whose
inhabitants
were
of
different
races
and
of
different
languages
of
commercial
enterprise
that
carried
men
comparatively
much
farther
than
they
now
go
on
trade
expeditions
though
we
have
thought
that
our
age
had
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
progress
in
this
matter
can
not
fail
to
have
an
interest
for
everyone
whose
attention
has
been
attracted
to
the
people
of
this
time
and
must
be
taken
as
a
symbol
of
the
initiative
of
the
generations
which
allowed
no
obstacle
to
hinder
their
progress
and
thought
no
difficulty
too
great
to
be
surmounted
in
beginning
the
history
of
the
great
commercial
league
which
in
the
thirteenth
century
first
opened
men
minds
to
the
possibilities
of
peace
and
commerce
among
the
nations
and
alas
that
it
should
be
said
did
more
perhaps
than
any
other
agent
except
christianity
to
awaken
in
different
races
the
sense
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
the
english
historian
of
the
hanseatic
league
miss
zimmern
in
the
stories
of
the
nations
said
there
is
scarcely
a
more
remarkable
chapter
in
history
than
that
which
deals
with
the
trading
alliance
or
association
known
as
the
hanseatic
league
the
league
has
long
since
passed
away
having
served
its
time
and
fulfilled
its
purpose
the
needs
and
circumstances
of
mankind
have
changed
and
new
methods
and
new
instruments
have
been
devised
for
carrying
on
the
commerce
of
the
world
yet
if
the
league
has
disappeared
the
beneficial
results
of
its
action
survive
to
europe
though
they
have
become
so
completely
a
part
of
our
daily
life
that
we
accept
them
as
matters
of
course
and
do
not
stop
to
inquire
into
their
origin
this
last
declaration
may
seem
surprising
for
comparatively
few
know
anything
about
this
medieval
commercial
league
yet
the
effects
claimed
for
it
are
only
what
we
have
seen
to
be
true
with
regard
to
most
of
the
important
institutions
of
the
period
they
were
the
origins
of
what
is
best
in
our
modern
life
like
many
of
the
great
movements
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
origin
of
the
hanseatic
league
is
clouded
somewhat
by
the
obscurity
of
the
times
and
the
lack
of
definite
historical
documents
footnote
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
just
before
the
middle
of
the
century
it
was
in
flourishing
existence
and
that
by
the
end
of
the
century
it
had
reached
that
acme
of
its
power
and
influence
which
it
was
to
maintain
for
several
centuries
in
spite
of
the
jealousy
of
the
nobility
of
certain
towns
that
did
not
have
the
same
privileges
and
even
of
the
authorities
of
the
various
countries
who
resented
more
and
more
as
time
went
on
the
growing
freedom
and
independence
of
these
wealthy
cities
the
impetus
for
the
formation
of
the
league
seems
to
have
been
given
during
the
crusades
like
so
many
other
of
the
important
movements
of
the
time
commerce
was
greatly
influenced
by
these
expeditions
and
the
commercial
spirit
not
only
aroused
but
shown
the
possibility
of
accomplishing
hitherto
impossible
results
in
the
matter
of
transportation
and
exchange
the
returning
crusaders
brought
back
with
them
many
precious
eastern
objects
whose
possession
was
a
source
of
envy
to
others
and
whose
value
was
rated
so
high
as
to
make
even
distant
travel
for
them
well
worth
while
the
returning
crusaders
also
knew
how
cheaply
objects
considered
very
precious
in
the
west
might
be
purchased
in
the
east
and
they
told
the
stories
of
their
own
acquisition
of
them
to
willing
listeners
who
were
stimulated
to
try
their
fortunes
in
expeditions
that
promised
such
rich
rewards
footnote
perhaps
no
better
idea
of
the
obscurity
of
the
origin
of
the
hansa
confederation
can
be
given
than
is
to
be
derived
from
the
fact
that
even
the
derivation
of
the
word
hansa
is
not
very
clear
bishop
ulfilas
in
his
old
gothic
translation
of
the
scriptures
used
the
word
hansa
to
designate
the
mob
of
soldiers
and
servants
of
the
high
priest
who
came
to
take
christ
prisoner
in
the
garden
later
on
the
word
hansa
was
used
to
mean
a
tax
or
a
contribution
this
term
was
originally
employed
to
designate
the
sum
of
money
which
each
of
the
cities
was
compelled
to
pay
on
becoming
a
member
of
the
league
and
it
is
thought
to
be
from
this
that
the
terms
hansa
and
hanseatic
league
were
eventually
derived

besides
the
crusaders
on
their
return
through
italy
had
observed
what
was
accomplished
by
the
league
of
the
lombard
cities
which
had
been
in
existence
in
a
more
or
less
imperfect
way
for
more
than
a
century
and
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
and
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
had
begun
to
provide
an
example
of
the
strength
there
is
in
union
and
of
the
power
for
good
there
is
in
properly
regulated
combinations
of
commercial
interests
with
due
regard
for
civic
rights
and
privileges
this
league
of
the
lombard
cities
was
encouraged
by
the
popes
especially
by
innocent
iii
and
his
successors
who
are
usually
said
to
have
given
it
their
approbation
for
their
own
purposes
though
this
is
to
look
at
but
one
side
of
the
case
the
german
emperors
endeavored
to
assert
their
rights
over
italian
territory
and
in
so
doing
came
into
collision
with
the
popes
not
only
in
temporal
matters
but
also
in
spiritual
things
as
we
have
noted
in
the
short
sketch
of
the
popes
of
the
century
innocent
iii
was
the
first
great
italian
patriot
and
original
advocate
of
italy
for
the
italians
he
constantly
opposed
the
influence
of
the
german
emperor
in
italian
politics
mainly
of
course
because
this
interfered
with
the
power
of
the
church
but
to
a
very
great
degree
also
because
it
proved
a
source
of
manifold
political
evil
for
the
italian
cities
the
germans
then
who
in
the
train
of
the
emperor
went
down
into
italy
saw
the
working
of
this
league
of
lombard
cities
talked
about
it
on
their
return
and
were
naturally
tempted
to
essay
what
might
be
accomplished
by
the
same
means
on
german
territory
these
two
elements
the
incentive
of
the
crusades
and
the
stimulus
of
the
example
of
the
italians
must
be
considered
as
at
the
basis
of
hansa
though
these
were
only
seeds
and
it
was
the
nurture
and
fostering
care
of
the
german
mind
which
ever
since
the
days
of
tacitus
had
been
noted
as
the
freest
in
europe
that
gave
the
league
its
wonderful
development
it
is
difficult
to
tell
how
many
towns
belonged
to
the
hanseatic
league
during
the
thirteenth
century
but
at
the
end
of
this
period
hansa
as
it
came
to
be
called
was
as
we
have
said
in
its
most
flourishing
condition
and
we
know
something
definite
of
its
numbers
a
little
more
than
half
a
century
later
in
deputies
from
all
the
towns
met
in
the
large
council
chamber
of
the
famous
town
hall
at
cologne
to
discuss
certain
injustices
that
had
been
committed
against
the
members
of
the
league
or
as
the
document
set
forth
against
the
free
german
merchants
in
order
to
determine
some
way
of
preventing
further
injuries
and
inflict
due
punishment
altogether
the
deputies
of
towns
were
present
and
declared
most
solemnly
that
because
of
the
wrongs
and
the
injuries
done
by
the
king
of
denmark
to
the
common
german
merchant
the
cities
would
be
his
enemies
and
help
one
another
faithfully
the
distant
and
smaller
cities
were
not
expected
to
send
troops
or
even
naval
forces
but
promised
to
give
contributions
in
money
such
cities
as
did
not
take
part
in
this
movement
were
to
be
considered
as
having
forfeited
their
membership
and
would
no
longer
be
permitted
to
trade
with
the
members
of
hansa
lest
it
should
be
thought
that
the
cities
were
incapable
of
enforcing
any
such
boycott
with
effect
the
story
of
the
town
of
lübeck
must
be
recalled
lübeck
on
one
occasion
refused
to
join
with
the
other
hansa
towns
in
a
boycott
of
certain
places
in
flanders
which
had
refused
to
observe
the
regulations
as
to
trading
one
of
these
was
to
the
effect
that
such
vessels
as
were
lost
on
a
coast
did
not
become
the
property
of
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
though
they
had
a
right
to
a
due
share
for
salvage
but
a
fair
proportion
must
be
returned
to
the
citizens
of
the
town
that
suffered
the
loss
lübeck
was
at
the
moment
one
of
the
most
powerful
commercial
cities
in
germany
and
her
citizens
seemed
to
think
that
they
could
violate
the
hansa
regulation
with
impunity
for
years
however
the
hansa
boycott
was
maintained
and
so
little
trading
was
done
in
the
city
that
according
to
one
old
writer
the
people
starved
the
markets
were
deserted
grass
grew
in
the
street
and
the
inhabitants
left
in
large
numbers
such
a
lesson
as
this
was
enough
to
make
the
hanseatic
decrees
be
observed
with
scrupulous
care
and
shows
the
perfection
of
the
organization
the
outcome
of
the
war
with
denmark
demonstrates
the
power
of
the
league
the
king
of
denmark
is
said
to
have
scorned
their
declaration
of
war
and
making
an
untranslatable
pun
on
the
word
hansa
called
the
members
of
the
league
geese
who
cackled
much
but
need
not
be
feared
the
fleet
of
the
league
however
succeeded
in
shutting
off
all
the
commerce
of
the
coast
of
denmark
and
though
there
was
a
truce
each
winter
the
war
was
renewed
vigorously
and
with
summer
many
of
the
danish
cities
were
ransacked
and
plundered
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
denmark
was
exhausted
and
the
people
so
weary
of
war
that
they
pleaded
for
peace
and
valdemar
had
to
accept
the
terms
which
the
geese
were
willing
to
offer
him
this
triumph
of
the
common
people
over
a
reigning
monarch
is
one
of
the
most
striking
passages
in
medieval
history
it
comes
about
a
half
century
after
the
close
of
the
thirteenth
and
is
evidently
the
direct
result
of
the
great
practical
forces
that
were
set
in
movement
during
that
wonderful
period
when
the
mighty
heart
of
humanity
was
everywhere
bestirring
men
to
deeds
of
high
purpose
and
significance
as
a
matter
of
fact
hansa
became
very
early
in
its
career
one
of
the
firmest
authorities
in
the
midst
of
these
troubled
times
and
meted
out
unfailingly
the
sternest
justice
against
those
who
infringed
its
rights
if
they
were
outsiders
or
broke
the
rules
of
the
league
if
they
were
its
members
it
was
ever
ready
to
send
its
ships
against
offenders
and
while
it
soon
came
to
be
feared
this
fear
was
mingled
with
respect
and
its
regulations
were
seldom
infringed
it
is
a
most
interesting
reflection
that
as
its
english
historian
says
never
once
in
the
whole
course
of
its
history
did
it
draw
the
sword
aggressively
or
against
its
own
members
while
it
was
ever
on
the
to
increase
its
power
by
adding
new
cities
to
the
league
cities
were
not
forced
to
join
and
when
it
meted
out
punishments
to
its
members
this
was
not
by
the
levying
of
war
but
by
fines
the
refusal
to
pay
these
being
followed
by
the
declaration
of
boycott
which
soon
brought
the
offender
to
terms
war
was
only
declared
in
all
cases
as
a
last
resort
and
the
ships
of
the
league
were
constantly
spoken
of
and
designated
in
all
documents
as
peace
ships
and
even
the
forts
which
the
league
built
for
the
protection
of
its
towns
or
as
places
where
its
members
might
be
sure
of
protection
were
described
as
peace
burgs
unfortunately
the
lessons
of
peace
that
were
thus
taught
by
commerce
were
not
to
bear
fruit
abundantly
for
many
centuries
after
the
thirteenth
it
is
practically
only
in
our
own
time
that
they
have
been
renewed
and
the
last
generation
or
two
has
rather
plumed
itself
over
the
fact
that
trade
was
doing
so
much
to
prevent
war
evidently
this
is
no
guarantee
of
the
perpetuation
of
such
an
improvement
in
national
or
international
morals
for
the
influence
of
hansa
for
peace
came
to
be
lost
entirely
after
a
few
centuries
the
cities
themselves
however
that
belonged
to
the
league
gradually
became
more
and
more
free
and
more
independent
of
their
rulers
it
was
thus
in
fact
that
the
free
cities
of
germany
had
their
origin
and
in
them
much
more
of
modern
liberty
was
born
than
has
ever
been
appreciated
except
by
those
whose
studies
have
brought
them
close
to
these
marvelous
medieval
manifestations
of
the
old
spirit
of
teutonic
freedom
the
names
of
most
of
the
cities
that
were
members
of
the
hansa
league
are
well
known
though
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
in
the
decrepitude
that
has
come
over
many
of
them
how
they
could
have
been
of
so
much
importance
as
has
been
claimed
for
them
in
the
middle
ages
all
the
cities
of
the
north
sea
and
the
baltic
sea
were
united
together
and
while
we
think
of
these
as
german
many
of
them
really
belonged
to
slav
people
at
this
time
so
that
the
membership
of
a
number
of
russian
cities
is
not
surprising
while
the
rhenish
cities
were
important
factors
in
the
league
cologne
indeed
being
one
of
the
most
important
bremen
and
hamburg
and
both
the
frankforts
and
rostock
and
lübeck
and
stralsund
and
tangermünde
and
warnemunde
were
important
members
novgorod
was
founded
by
hansa
for
the
purpose
of
trading
with
the
orientals
and
the
volga
the
dnieper
the
dwina
and
the
oder
were
extensively
used
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
goods
here
and
there
in
central
europe
one
of
their
most
famous
towns
winetha
in
german
julin
in
danish
disappeared
beneath
the
waters
of
the
baltic
sea
and
gave
rise
to
many
legends
of
its
reappearance
it
is
hard
to
realize
that
it
was
so
important
that
it
was
called
the
venice
of
the
north
and
was
seriously
compared
with
its
great
southern
rival
a
good
idea
of
the
intimate
relations
of
the
hansa
towns
to
england
and
the
english
people
can
be
obtained
from
the
article
on
the
subject
written
by
richard
lodge
for
the
ninth
edition
of
the
encyclopedia
britannica
a
single
paragraph
of
this
compresses
much
of
the
external
and
internal
history
of
the
rise
and
development
of
hansa
it
was
rather
to
be
expected
that
the
commercial
relations
between
england
and
the
various
cities
situated
along
the
north
sea
as
well
as
the
baltic
and
up
the
rhine
would
be
active
and
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
careful
regulation
unless
the
modern
mind
is
actually
brought
directly
in
touch
however
with
the
complex
yet
very
practical
state
of
affairs
which
actually
existed
it
will
utterly
fail
to
appreciate
how
thoroughly
progressive
and
enterprising
were
these
medieval
peoples
enterprise
and
practicalness
we
are
apt
to
think
of
as
the
exclusive
possession
of
much
more
modern
generations
least
of
all
would
we
be
apt
to
consider
them
as
likely
to
be
found
in
the
thirteenth
century
yet
here
they
are
and
the
commercial
arrangements
which
were
made
are
as
absolute
premonitions
of
our
modern
thought
as
were
the
literature
and
architecture
the
painting
even
the
teachings
of
science
at
the
same
period

came
to
england
mostly
from

the
first
german
town

obtained
great
importance
both
at
home
and
abroad
its
citizens
possessed
at
an
early
date
a
of
their
own
in
london
and
all
germans
who
wished
to
trade
with

had
to

from

from

from

when
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
rapidly
rising
town
of
lübeck
wished
to
be
admitted
into
the
guild
every
effort
was
made
to
keep
her
out
the
intervention
of
frederick
ii
was
powerless
to
overcome
the
dread
felt
by
cologne
towards
a
possible
rival
to
its
supremacy
but
this
obstacle
to
the
extension
of
the
league
was
soon
overcome
in
a
charter
of
henry
iii
assured
protection
to
all
german
merchants
a
few
years
later
hamburg
and
lübeck
also
were
allowed
to
form
their
own
guilds
the
hansa

cologne
which
had
long
been
the
only
guild

picture
of
the
activity

lost
for
some
almost
unaccountable

much
of

the
result
was
a
lamentable
retrogression
from
the
advances

that

the
extent
and
very
natural
development
of
this
community
of
interests
must
ever
attract
attention
it
is
the
first
time
in
our
modern
history
that
it
occurs
and
men
of
some
seven
different
races
and
tongues
were
at

drawn
into
it

extension

in
what

the
heart
of

is
a
surprising
demonstration
of
successful
enterprise
and
spread
of
influence
almost
incredible
the
settling
of
the
trade
disputes
of
this
distant
russian
city
in
the
courts
of
a
north
sea
town
is
an
evidence
of
advance
in
commercial
relations
emphasized
by
the
writer
in
the
britannica
that
deserves
to
be
well
weighed
as
a
manifestation
of
what
is
often
thought
to
be
the
exclusively
modern
recognition
of
the
rights
of
commerce
and
the
claims
of
justice
over
even
national
feelings
the
league
between
lübeck
and
hamburg
was
not
the
only
and
possibly
not
the
first
league
among
the
german
towns
but
it
gradually
absorbed
all
others
besides
the
influence
of
foreign
commercial
interests
there
were
other
motives
which
compelled
the
towns
to
union
the
chief
of
these
were
the
protection
of
commercial
routes
both
by
sea
and
land
and
the
vindication
of
town
independence
as
opposed
to
claims
of
the
landed
aristocracy
the
first
to
join
the
league
were
the
wendish
towns
to
the
east
wismar
rostock
stralsund
which
had
always
been
intimately
connected
with
lübeck
and
were
united
by
a
common
system
of
laws
known
as
the
recht
lübeck
laws
the
saxon
and
westphalian
towns
had
long
possessed
a
league
among
themselves
they
also
joined
themselves
to
lübeck
lübeck
now
became
the
most
important
town
in
germany
it
had
already
surpassed
cologne
both
in
london
and
bruges
it
soon
gained
a
similar
victory
over
wisby
at
a
great
convention
in
which
towns
from
cologne
to
revel
took
part
it
was
decided
that
appeals
from
novgorod
which
had
hitherto
been
decided
at
wisby
should
henceforth
be
brought
to
lübeck
after
much
travail
and
vexation
of
spirit
after
much
diplomacy
and
political
and
parliamentary
discussion
after
much
striving
on
the
part
of
the
men
in
all
nations
who
have
the
great
cause
of
universal
peace
for
mankind
at
heart
we
have
reached
a
position
where
at
least
commercial
difficulties
can
be
referred
to
a
sort
of
international
court
for
adjudication
the
standing
of
this
court
is
not
very
clear
as
yet
special
arrangements
at
least
are
required
if
not
special
treaties
in
many
cases
even
for
the
reference
of
such
merely
commercial
difficulties
as
to
it
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
special
tribunals
had
to
be
erected
for
the
settlement
of
such
difficulties
between
nations
in
the
twentieth
century
the
outlook
is
more
hopeful
and
the
actual
accomplishment
is
indeed
encouraging
in
the
thirteenth
century
with
the
absence
of
the
telegraph
and
the
cable
with
the
slowness
of
sailing
vessels
and
the
distance
of
towns
emphasizing
all
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
the
hanseatic
league
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
international
tribunal
whose
judgments
with
regard
to
commercial
difficulties
were
final
and
were
accepted
by
men
of
many
different
races
and
habits
and
customs
and
to
which
causes
were
referred
without
any
of
the
immense
machinery
apparently
required
at
the
present
time
this
is
the
real
triumph
of
the
commercial
development
of
the
thirteenth
century
while
it
may
be
astonishing
to
many
modern
people
to
learn
how
much
was
accomplished
in
this
utterly
unexpected
quarter
it
will
not
be
a
surprise
to
those
who
realize
the
thoroughly
practical
character
of
the
century
and
the
perfectly
matter
of
fact
way
in
which
it
went
about
settling
all
the
difficulties
that
presented
themselves
and
how
often
they
succeeded
in
reaching
a
very
practical
if
not
always
ideal
solution
the
sad
feature
of
the
case
is
to
think
that
most
of
this
coming
together
of
nations
was
lost
by
the
gradual
development
of
national
feeling
much
of
benefit
as
there
may
have
been
in
that
for
the
human
race
and
by
the
drawing
of
the
language
lines
between
nations
more
closely
than
they
had
been
before
for
the
next
three
centuries
saw
the
development
of
modern
tongues
into
the
form
which
they
have
held
ever
since
hansa
did
more
than
almost
any
other
institution
in
northern
europe
to
establish
the
reign
of
law
if
it
had
accomplished
no
other
purpose
this
would
make
it
eminently
worthy
of
the
study
of
those
who
are
interested
in
sociology
and
social
evolution
before
the
time
of
hansa
the
merchant
by
sea
or
land
was
liable
to
all
sorts
of
impositions
arbitrary
taxes
injustices
and
even
the
loss
of
life
as
well
of
his
goods
as
hansa
gained
in
power
however
these
abuses
disappeared
perhaps
the
most
noteworthy
improvement
came
with
regard
to
navigation
there
is
a
story
told
of
a
famous
rock
in
brittany
on
which
many
ships
were
wrecked
during
the
middle
ages
even
as
late
as
the
thirteenth
century
sometimes
false
lights
were
displayed
on
this
rock
with
the
idea
of
tempting
vessels
to
their
destruction
on
it
everything
that
was
thrown
ashore
in
the
neighborhood
was
considered
to
be
the
property
of
the
people
who
gathered
it
except
that
a
certain
portion
of
its
value
had
to
be
paid
to
the
lord
of
the
manor
this
worthy
representative
of
the
upper
classes
is
said
to
have
pointed
out
the
rock
to
some
visiting
nobleman
friends
one
day
and
declared
that
it
was
more
precious
to
him
than
the
most
precious
stone
in
the
diadem
of
any
ruling
monarch
in
europe
this
represents
the
state
of
feeling
with
regard
to
such
subjects
when
hansa
started
in
to
correct
the
abuses
it
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
serious
disgrace
to
the
thirteenth
century
that
such
a
low
state
of
ethical
feeling
should
have
existed
but
it
is
the
amelioration
of
conditions
which
obliterated
such
false
sentiments
that
constitutes
the
triumph
of
the
period
on
the
other
hand
we
must
not
with
smug
think
that
our
generation
is
so
much
better
than
those
of
the
past
it
is
easy
to
be
pharisaical
while
we
forget
that
many
a
fortune
in
modern
times
suffers
shipwreck
on
the
coasts
of
business
and
investment
because
the
false
lights
of
advertising
intended
to
deceive
are
displayed
very
prominently
for
those
who
are
only
anxious
as
were
the
mariners
of
the
olden
times
to
make
their
fortunes
doubtless
too
the
proprietors
of
many
of
the
papers
which
display
such
advertisements
and
it
is
nonsense
to
say
that
they
are
unconscious
of
the
harm
they
do
are
quite
as
proud
of
the
magnificent
revenue
that
their
advertising
columns
bring
to
them
as
was
the
breton
noble
of
the
thirteenth
century
man
has
not
changed
much
in
the
interval
lest
it
should
be
thought
that
even
the
initiation
into
secret
societies
of
various
kinds
is
the
invention
of
modern
times
it
seems
well
to
give
some
of
the
details
of
the
tests
through
which
those
seeking
to
be
members
of
the
hanseatic
league
were
subjected
by
those
who
were
already
initiated
it
may
possibly
seem
that
some
of
these
customs
were
too
barbarous
to
mention
in
the
same
breath
with
the
initiations
but
if
it
is
recalled
that
at
least
once
a
year
some
serious
accident
is
reported
as
the
result
of
the
thoughtless
fooling
of
frat
students
at
our
universities
this
opinion
may
be
withdrawn
miss
helen
zimmern
in
her
story
of
the
hansa
towns
already
quoted
several
times
has
a
paragraph
or
two
of
descriptions
of
these
that
we
shall
quote
it
may
be
well
to
remember
that
these
tests
were
not
entirely
without
a
serious
significance
for
the
members
of
the
hansa
much
was
expected
of
those
who
belonged
to
the
hansa
guild
a
number
of
precious
trade
secrets
were
entrusted
them
and
they
alone
knew
the
methods
and
mysteries
of
hansa
in
order
that
these
might
not
by
any
possibility
be
betrayed
the
members
of
hansa
who
lived
in
foreign
countries
were
forbidden
to
marry
while
abroad
and
were
bound
under
the
severest
penalties
to
live
a
life
of
celibacy
they
were
not
supposed
to
be
absent
from
the
houses
assigned
to
them
during
the
night
and
their
factories
so
called
or
of
residence
were
guarded
by
night
watchman
and
fierce
dogs
in
order
to
secure
the
keeping
of
these
rules
besides
torture
was
a
very
common
thing
in
those
times
and
a
man
who
belonged
to
a
country
that
happened
to
be
at
war
for
the
moment
might
very
easily
be
subjected
to
torture
for
some
reason
or
another
with
the
idea
of
securing
important
information
from
him
if
the
members
of
hansa
wanted
to
be
reasonably
assured
that
new
members
would
not
give
up
their
secrets
without
a
brave
struggle
they
had
no
better
way
than
by
these
tests
for
which
there
was
therefore
some
excuse
as
to
the
brutality
of
the
tests
perhaps
miss
zimmern
in
maidenly
way
has
said
too
much
we
commend
her
paragraphs
to
the
modern
committees
of
reception
of
college
secret
societies
because
here
as
elsewhere
this
generation
may
get
points
from
the
thirteenth
century

we
can
not
sully
our
pages
by
detailing
the
thirteen
different
games
or
modes
of
martyrdom
that
were
in
use
at
bergen
our
more
civilized
age
could
not
tolerate
the
recital
in
those
days
they
attracted
a
crowd
of
eager
spectators
who
applauded
the
more
vociferously
the
more
cruel
and
barbarous
the
tortures
the
most
popular
were
those
practices
known
as
the
smoke
water
and
flogging
games
mad
cruel
pranks
calculated
to
cause
a
freshman
to
lose
health
and
reason
truly
dantesque
hell
tortures
were
these
initiations
into
hansa
mysteries
merely
to
indicate
their
nature
we
will
mention
that
for
the
smoke
game
the
victim
was
pulled
up
the
big
chimney
of
the
schutting
while
there
burned
beneath
him
the
most
filthy
materials
sending
up
a
most
nauseous
stench
and
choking
wreaths
of
smoke
while
in
this
position
he
was
asked
a
number
of
questions
to
which
he
was
forced
under
yet
more
terrible
penalties
to
reply
if
he
survived
his
torture
he
was
taken
out
into
the
yard
and
plied
under
the
pump
with
six
tons
of
water
even
the
water
cure
is
not
new
there
was
a
variety
about
the
tests
at
different
times
and
places
that
show
no
lack
of
invention
on
the
part
of
the
members
of
hansa
with
regard
to
other
water
tests
miss
zimmern
has
furnished
some
interesting
details
the
game
that
took
place
at
whitsuntide
consisted
in
first
treating
the
probationer
to
food
and
then
taking
him
out
to
sea
in
a
boat
here
he
was
stripped
thrown
into
the
ocean
ducked
three
times
made
to
swallow
much
and
thereafter
mercilessly
flogged
by
all
the
inmates
of
the
boats
the
third
chief
game
was
no
less
dangerous
to
life
and
limb
it
took
place
a
few
days
after
and
was
a
rude
perversion
of
the
may
games
the
victims
had
first
to
go
out
into
the
woods
to
gather
the
branches
with
which
later
they
were
to
be
birched
returned
to
the
factory
rough
horse
play
pranks
were
practised
upon
them
then
followed
an
ample
dinner
which
was
succeeded
by
mock
combats
and
ended
in
the
victims
being
led
into
the
paradise
where
disguised
men
whipped
them
till
they
drew
blood
while
outside
this
black
hole
another
party
made
hellish
music
with
pipes
drums
and
triangles
to
deafen
the
screams
of
the
tortured
the
as
considered
ended
when
the
shrieks
of
the
victims
were
sufficiently
loud
to
overcome
the
pandemonic
music
some
of
the
extreme
physical
cruelties
of
the
initiations
our
modern
fraternities
have
eliminated
but
the
whole
story
has
a
much
more
familiar
air
than
we
might
have
expected
probably
the
most
interesting
feature
of
the
history
of
the
hanseatic
league
is
the
fact
that
this
great
combination
for
purposes
of
trade
and
commerce
proved
a
source
of
liberty
for
the
citizens
of
the
various
towns
and
enabled
them
to
improve
their
political
status
better
than
any
other
single
means
at
this
precious
time
of
development
of
legal
and
social
rights
this
is
all
the
more
interesting
because
great
commercial
combinations
with
similar
purposes
in
modern
times
have
usually
proved
fruitful
rather
of
opposite
results
a
few
persons
have
been
very
much
benefited
by
them
or
at
least
have
made
much
money
by
them
which
is
quite
another
thing
though
money
is
supposed
to
represent
power
and
influence
but
the
great
mass
of
the
people
have
been
deprived
of
opportunities
to
rise
and
have
had
taken
from
them
many
chances
for
the
exercise
of
initiative
that
existed
before
there
is
a
curious
effect
of
hansa
upon
the
political
fortunes
of
the
people
of
the
cities
that
were
members
of
the
league
which
deserves
to
be
carefully
studied
as
with
regard
to
so
many
other
improvements
that
have
come
in
the
history
of
the
race
it
was
not
a
question
so
much
of
the
recognition
of
great
principles
as
of
money
and
revenues
that
proved
the
origin
of
amelioration
of
civic
conditions
these
commercial
cities
accumulated
wealth
money
was
necessary
for
their
rulers
for
the
maintenance
of
their
power
and
above
all
for
the
waging
of
war
in
return
for
moneys
given
for
such
purposes
the
cities
claimed
for
the
inhabitants
and
were
granted
many
privileges
these
became
perpetuated
and
as
time
went
on
were
added
to
as
new
opportunities
for
the
collection
of
additional
revenues
occurred
until
finally
an
important
set
of
fundamental
rights
with
documentary
confirmation
were
in
the
hands
of
the
city
authorities
one
would
like
to
think
that
this
state
of
affairs
developed
as
the
result
of
the
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
ruling
sovereign
of
the
benefits
that
were
conferred
on
his
realm
by
having
in
it
or
associated
with
it
an
important
trading
city
whose
enterprising
citizens
gave
occupation
to
many
hands
this
was
very
rarely
the
case
however
but
as
was
true
of
the
legal
rights
obtained
by
england
citizens
during
the
thirteenth
century
it
was
largely
a
question
of
the
coordination
of
taxation
and
legislative
representation
and
the
consequent
attainment
of
privileges
the
most
important
effect
on
the
life
of
europe
and
the
growth
of
civilization
that
the
hanseatic
league
exerted
was
its
success
in
showing
that
people
of
many
different
nations
and
races
living
under
very
different
circumstances
might
still
be
united
under
similar
laws
that
would
enable
them
to
accomplish
certain
objects
which
they
had
in
view
germans
slavs
and
english
learned
to
live
in
one
towns
and
while
observing
the
customs
of
these
various
places
maintained
the
privileges
of
their
homes
the
mutual
influence
of
these
people
on
one
another
many
of
them
being
the
most
practical
and
enterprising
individuals
of
the
time
could
scarcely
fail
to
produce
noteworthy
effects
in
broadening
the
minds
of
those
with
whom
they
came
in
contact
it
is
to
this
period
that
we
must
trace
the
beginnings
of
international
law
hansa
showed
the
world
how
much
commercial
relations
were
facilitated
by
uniform
laws
and
by
just
treatment
of
even
the
citizens
of
foreign
countries
it
is
to
commerce
that
we
owe
the
first
recognition
of
the
rights
of
the
people
of
other
countries
even
in
time
of
war
if
the
hanseatic
league
had
done
nothing
else
but
this
it
must
be
considered
as
an
important
factor
in
the
development
of
our
modern
civilization
and
an
element
of
influence
great
as
any
other
in
this
wonderful

chapters
that
might
have
been
america
in
the
thirteenth
century
to
most
people
it
would
seem
quite
out
of
the
question
that
a
chapter
on
america
in
the
thirteenth
century
might
have
been
written
one
of
the
most
surprising
chapters
for
most
readers
in
the
previous
edition
was
that
on
great
explorers
and
the
foundation
of
geography
for
it
was
a
revelation
to
learn
that
thirteenth
century
travelers
had
anticipated
all
of
our
discoveries
in
the
far
and
in
the
near
east
seven
centuries
ago
certain
documents
have
turned
up
however
which
make
it
very
clear
that
with
the
same
motives
as
those
which
urged
eastern
travelers
europeans
went
just
as
far
towards
the
west
at
this
time
documents
found
in
the
vatican
archives
in
and
exhibited
at
louis
in
have
set
at
rest
finally
and
absolutely
the
long
disputed
question
of
the
discovery
of
america
by
the
norsemen
and
in
connection
with
these
the
story
of
america
in
the
thirteenth
century
might
well
have
been
told
there
is
a
letter
from
pope
innocent
dated
february
addressed
to
the
archbishop
of
norway
who
held
jurisdiction
over
greenland
which
shows
not
only
the
presence
of
the
norsemen
on
the
american
continent
at
this
time
but
also
that
they
had
been
here
for
a
considerable
period
and
that
there
were
a
number
of
churches
and
pastors
and
large
flocks
in
whom
the
roman
see
had
a
lively
interest
there
are

ii
a

upper
house
in
most
historical
attempts
at
government
by
the
people
it
has
been
recognized
that
legislation
is
better
balanced
if
there
are
two
chambers
in
the
body
one
directly
elected
by
the
people
the
other
indirectly
chosen
and
representing
important
vested
interests
that
are
likely
to
make
its
members
conservative
the
initiative
for
legislation
comes
as
a
rule
from
the
direct
representatives
of
the
people
while
the
upper
chamber
represses
radical
or
sudden
changes
in
legislative
policy
yet
does
not

too
much

illustration

iii
mentioning
greenland
during
the
last
few
years
a
crisis
in
english
politics
has
led
to
a
very
general
demand
for
a
modification
of
the
status
of
the
house
of
lords
while
almost
similar
conditions
have
led
to
the
beginning
at
least
of
a
similar
demand
for
the
modification
of
our
senate
in
this
country
both
these
upper
chambers
have
come
to
represent
vested
interests
to
too
great
a
degree
the
house
of
lords
has
been
the
subject
of
special
deprecation
the
remark
is
sometimes
made
that
it
is
unfortunate
that
england
is
weighted
down
by
this
political
incubus
the
house
of
lords
which
is
spoken
of
as
a
heritage
from
the
middle
ages
the
general
impression
of
course
is
that
the
english
house
of
lords
as
at
present
constituted
comes
down
from
the
oldest
times
of
constitutional
government
in
england
nothing
could
well
be
more
untrue
than
any
such
idea
the
old
upper
chamber
of
england
the
medieval
house
of
lords
was
an
eminently
representative
body
out
of
the
or
more
of
members
of
the
english
house
of
lords
at
the
present
time
about
five
hundred
and
fifty
hold
their
seats
by
heredity
only
about
are
in
some
sense
elective
at
least
of
these
elected
peers
however
must
be
chosen
from
the
hereditary
nobility
of
ireland
and
scotland
nearly
of
the
membership
of
the
house
of
lords
as
at
present
constituted
owe
their
place
in
national
legislation
entirely
to
heredity
until
the
reformation
this
was
not
so
more
than
of
the
english
house
of
lords
a
good
working
majority
consisted
of
the
lords
spiritual
besides
the
bishops
and
archbishops
there
were
the
abbots
and
priors
of
monasteries
and
the
masters
of
religious
orders
these
men
as
a
rule
had
come
up
from
the
people
they
had
risen
to
their
positions
by
intellectual
abilities
and
by
administrative
capacity
the
abbots
and
other
superiors
of
religious
orders
had
been
chosen
by
their
monks
as
a
rule
because
having
shown
that
they
knew
how
to
rule
themselves
they
were
deemed
most
fitting
to
rule
over
others
even
in
our
day
when
the
church
occupies
nothing
like
the
position
in
the
hearts
of
the
masses
that
she
held
in
the
ages
of
faith
our
catholic
cardinals
archbishops
and
bishops
both
here
and
in
england
are
chosen
as
members
of
arbitration
boards
to
settle
strikes
and
other
social
difficulties
because
it
is
felt
that
the
working
class
has
full
confidence
in
them
and
that
they
are
thoroughly
representative
of
the
spirit
of
democracy
in
england
cardinal
manning
served
more
than
once
in
critical
social
conditions
in
this
country
we
have
had
a
series
of
such
examples
from
these
we
can
better
understand
what
the
lords
spiritual
represented
in
the
english
house
of
lords
there
were
abuses
though
they
were
not
nearly
so
frequent
as
were
thought
by
which
unworthy
men
sometimes
reached
such
positions
for
men
abuse
even
the
best
things
but
in
general
these
clerical
members
of
the
house
of
lords
were
the
chosen
intellectual
and
moral
products
of
the
kingdom
since
they
were
without
families
they
had
less
temptation
to
serve
personal
interests
and
besides
they
had
received
a
training
in
unselfishness
and
the
best
might
be
expected
of
them
for
an
ideal
second
chamber
i
know
none
that
can
compare
with
this
old
english
house
of
lords
of
the
middle
ages
how
much
it
was
responsible
for
the
foundation
of
the
liberties
of
which
the
people
are
deservedly
so
proud
and
which
have
been
treated
in
some
detail
in
the
chapter
on
origins
in
law
would
be
interesting
to
trace
iii
the
parish
and
training
in
citizenship
toulmin
smith
in
his
book
on
the
parish
and
dom
gasquet
in
his
volume
on
the
parish
before
the
reformation
have
shown
what
a
magnificent
institution
for
popular
was
the
english
medieval
parish
and
how
much
this
contributed
to
the
solution
of
important
social
problems
and
to
the
creation
of
a
true
democratic
spirit
toulmin
smith
calls
particular
attention
to
the
fact
that
when
local
gets
out
of
the
hands
of
the
people
of
a
neighborhood
personal
civic
energy
goes
to
sleep
the
feeling
of
mutual
responsibility
of
the
men
of
the
place
is
lost
to
the
great
detriment
of
their
larger
citizenship
in
municipality
and
nation
in
the
parish
however
forming
a
separate
community
of
which
the
members
had
rights
and
duties
the
primal
solid
basis
for
government
the
parish
authorities
took
charge
of
the
highways
the
roads
the
paths
the
health
the
police
the
constabulary
and
the
fires
of
their
neighborhood
they
kept
besides
a
registry
of
births
and
deaths
and
marriages
when
these
essentially
local
concerns
are
controlled
in
large
bodies
the
liability
to
abuse
at
once
becomes
easy
and
political
corruption
sets
in
he
mentions
besides
many
parochial
institutions
a
parochial
friendly
society
for
loans
on
security
parish
gilds
for
insurance
and
many
other
phases
of
that
thoroughly
organized
mutual
aid
so
characteristic
of
the
middle
ages
these
parishes
became
completely
organized
so
as
to
be
thoroughly
democratic
and
representative
of
all
the
possibilities
of
local
under
king
edward
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
rev
augustus
jessopp
in
after
the
great
pillage
tells
the
story
of
how
the
parishes
were
broken
up
as
a
consequence
of
the
confiscation
of
their
endowment
during
the
reformation
the
quotation
from
him
may
be
found
in
appendix
iii
in
the
section
on
how
it
all
stopped
toulmin
smith
is
not
so
emphatic
but
he
is
scarcely
less
explicit
than
jessopp
the
attempts
of
ecclesiastical
authority
to
encroach
on
the
civil
authorities
of
the
parish
have
been
more
successful
since
the
reformation
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
that
time
all
government
became
centralized
and
complete
contradiction
though
it
may
seem
to
be
of
what
is
sometimes
declared
the
place
of
the
reformation
in
the
history
of
human
liberty
the
genuine
democratic
institutions
of
england
were
to
a
great
extent
impaired
by
the
reform
and
an
autocracy
which
later
developed
into
an
autocratic
aristocracy
largely
took
its
place
out
of
that
england
has
gradually
lifted
itself
during
the
nineteenth
century
even
now
however
as
pointed
out
in
the
preceding
chapter
that
might
have
been
the
house
of
lords
is
not
at
all
what
it
was
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
when
the
majority
of
its
members
were
lords
spiritual
men
who
had
come
up
from
the
masses
as
a
rule
iv
the
chance
to
rise
we
are
very
prone
to
think
that
even
though
there
may
have
been
excellent
opportunities
for
the
higher
education
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
in
many
ways
an
ideal
education
of
the
masses
still
there
was
one
great
social
drawback
in
those
times
the
lack
of
opportunity
for
men
of
humble
birth
to
rise
to
higher
stations
nothing
however
is
less
true
there
probably
never
was
a
time
when
even
members
of
the
poorest
families
might
rise
more
readily
or
rapidly
to
the
highest
positions
in
the
land
the
sons
of
village
merchants
and
village
artisans
nay
the
sons
and
grandsons
of
farmers
bound
to
the
soil
could
by
educational
success
become
clergymen
in
various
ranks
and
by
attaining
a
bishopric
or
the
position
of
abbot
or
prior
of
a
monastery
reach
a
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
most
of
the
lord
high
chancellors
of
england
during
the
middle
ages
and
some
of
them
are
famous
for
their
genius
as
canon
and
civil
lawyers
for
their
diplomatic
abilities
and
their
breadth
of
view
and
capacity
as
administrators
were
the
sons
of
humble
parents
take
the
single
example
of
stratford
the
details
of
whose
inhabitants
lives
because
of
the
greatness
of
one
of
them
have
attracted
more
attention
than
those
of
any
other
town
of
corresponding
size
in
england
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
it
is
only
what
we
would
call
a
village
and
it
probably
did
not
have
inhabitants
if
indeed
the
number
was
not
less
than
in
his
book
shakespeare
the
boy
rolfe
calls
attention
to
certain
conditions
that
interest
us
in
the
old
village
he
tells
us
of
what
happened
as
a
result
of
the
development
of
liberty
in
the
thirteenth
century
villeinage
gradually
disappeared
in
the
reign
of
edward
vii
and
those
who
had
been
subject
to
it
became
free
tenants
paying
definite

president
woodrow
wilson
of
princeton
realized
sympathetically
this
great
element
of
saving
democracy
in
the
middle
ages
and
has
paid
worthy
tribute
to
it
he
said
the
only
reason
why
government
did
not
suffer
dry
rot
in
the
middle
ages
under
the
aristocratic
systems
which
then
prevailed
was
that
the
men
who
were
efficient
instruments
of
government
were
drawn
from
the
church
from
that
great
church
that
body
which
we
now
distinguish
from
other
church
bodies
as
the
roman
catholic
church
the
roman
catholic
church
then
as
now
was
a
great
democracy
there
was
no
peasant
so
humble
that
he
might
not
become
a
priest
and
no
priest
so
obscure
that
he
might
not
become
pope
of
christendom
and
every
chancellery
in
europe
was
ruled
by
those
learned
trained
and
accomplished
men
the
priesthood
of
that
great
and
then
dominant
church
and
so
what
kept
government
alive
in
the
middle
ages
was
this
constant
rise
of
the
sap
from
the
bottom
from
the
rank
and
file
of
the
great
body
of
the
people
through
the
open
channels
of
the
roman
catholic
priesthood
insurance
insurance
is
usually
supposed
to
be
a
modern
idea
representing
one
of
those
developments
of
the
capitalization
of
mutual
risks
of
life
property
and
the
like
that
have
come
as
a
consequence
of
modern
progress
the
insurance
system
of
the
middle
ages
the
organization
of
which
came
in
the
thirteenth
century
is
therefore
extremely
interesting
it
was
accomplished
as
was
every
form
of
and
of
effort
through
special
gilds
or
through
the
trade
or
merchant
gilds
among
the
objects
of
the
gilds
enumerated
by
toulmin
smith
is
insurance
against
loss
by
fire
this
was
paid
through
the
particular
gild
to
which
the
merchant
belonged
or
in
the
case
of
the
artisan
through
a
special
gild
which
he
joined
for
the
purpose
provision
was
made
however
for
much
more
than
insurance
by
fire
our
fire
insurance
companies
are
probably
several
centuries
old
so
also
are
our
insurance
arrangements
against
shipwreck
other
features
of
insurance
however
are
much
more
recent
practically
all
of
these
were
in
active
existence
during
the
middle
ages
though
they
disappeared
with
the
reformation
and
then
did
not
come
into
existence
again
for
several
centuries
and
indeed
not
until
our
own
time
the
old
gilds
for
instance
provided
insurance
against
loss
from
flood
a
feature
of
insurance
that
has
not
so
far
as
i
know
developed
in
our
time
against
loss
by
robbery
our
burglary
insurance
is
quite
recent
against
loss
by
the
fall
of
a
house
by
imprisonment
and
then
also
insurance
against
the
loss
of
cattle
and
farm
products
all
the
features
of
life
insurance
also
were
in
existence
the
partial
disability
clauses
of
life
or
accident
insurance
policies
are
recent
developments
in
the
old
days
there
is
insurance
against
the
loss
of
sight
against
the
loss
of
a
limb
or
any
other
form
of
crippling
the
deaf
and
dumb
might
be
insured
so
as
to
secure
an
income
for
them
and
corresponding
relief
for
leprosy
might
be
obtained
so
that
if
one
were
set
apart
from
the
community
by
the
law
requiring
segregation
of
lepers
there
might
be
provision
for
food
and
lodging
even
though
productive
work
had
become
impossible
in
a
word
the
insurance
system
of
the
middle
ages
was
thoroughly
developed
it
was
not
capitalistic
the
charges
were
only
enough
to
maintain
the
system
and
not
such
as
to
provide
large
percentage
returns
on
invested
stock
and
on
bonds
and
the
accumulation
of
huge
surpluses
that
almost
inevitably
lead
to
gross
abuses
what
is
best
in
our
modern
system
of
insurance
is
an
imitation
of
the
older
methods
certain
of
the
trade
insurance
companies
which
assume
a
portion
of
the
risk
on
mills
factories
and
the
like
are
typical
examples
they
know
the
conditions
enforce
proper
precautions
keep
an
absolute
check
on
suspicious
losses
accumulate
only
a
moderate
surplus
and
present
very
few
opportunities
for
insurance
abuses
the
same
thing
is
true
for
the
fraternal
societies
that
conduct
life
insurance
when
properly
managed
they
represent
the
lowest
possible
cost
and
the
best
efficiency
with
least
opportunities
for
fraud
and
without
any
temptations
to
interfere
with
legislation
and
any
allurements
for
legislators
to
spend
their
time
making
strike
and
graft
bills
instead
of
doing
legislative
work
vi
old
age
pensions
this
generation
has
occupied
itself
much
with
the
question
of
old
age
pensions
probably
most
people
feel
that
this
is
the
first
time
in
the
world
history
that
such
arrangements
have
been
made
the
movement
is
supposed
to
represent
a
recent
development
of
humanitarian
purpose
and
to
be
a
feature
of
recent
philanthropic
evolution
it
is
rather
interesting
in
the
light
of
that
idea
to
see
how
well
they
accomplish
this
same
purpose
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
in
our
time
it
has
been
a
government
affair
with
all
the
possibilities
of
abuse
that
there
are
in
a
huge
pension
system
and
surely
no
country
knows
it
better
than
we
do
here
in
america
the
old
countries
germany
and
france
have
established
a
contributing
system
of
pension
this
was
the
model
of
their
system
of
caring
for
the
old
and
the
disabled
in
the
middle
ages
toulmin
smith
cites
a
rule
of
one
of
the
gilds
which
gives
us
exactly
the
status
of
the
old
age
disability
pension
question
after
a
workman
had
been
seven
years
a
member
the
gild
assured
him
a
livelihood
in
case
of
disability
from
any
cause
when
we
recall
that
employer
as
well
as
employee
as
a
rule
belonged
to
the
gild
and
this
was
a
real
mutual
organization
in
which
there
was
a
sharing
of
the
various
risks
of
life
we
see
how
eminently
well
adapted
to
avoid
abuses
this
old
system
was
where
the
pensioners
appeal
to
a
government
pension
system
abuses
are
almost
inevitable
there
is
the
constant
temptation
to
exploit
the
system
on
the
part
of
the
pensioners
because
they
have
the
feeling
that
if
they
do
not
others
will
then
the
investigation
of
each
particular
case
is
difficult
and
favoritism
and
graft
of
various
kinds
inevitably
finds
its
way
in
where
the
pension
is
paid
by
a
small
body
of
fellow
workmen
the
investigation
is
easy
the
temptation
to
exploit
does
not
readily
find
place
and
while
abuses
are
to
some
extent
inevitable
these
are
small
in
amount
and
not
likely
to
be
frequent
friends
and
neighbors
know
conditions
and
men
are
not
pauperized
by
the
system
and
if
after
an
injury
that
seemed
at
first
so
disabling
as
to
be
permanent
the
pensioner
should
improve
enough
to
be
able
to
get
back
to
work
or
at
least
to
do
something
to
support
himself
the
system
is
elastic
enough
so
that
he
is
not
likely
to
be
tempted
to
continue
to
live
on
others
rather
than
on
his
own
efforts
vii
the
ways
and
means
of
charity
organized
charity
most
of
us
would
be
apt
to
think
that
our
modern
methods
of
obtaining
funds
for
charitable
purposes
represented
definite
developments
and
that
at
least
special
features
of
our
collections
for
charity
were
our
own
invention
in
recent
years
the
value
of
being
able
to
reach
a
great
many
people
even
for
small
amounts
has
been
particularly
recognized
tag
day
is
one
manifestation
of
that
everyone
in
a
neighborhood
is
asked
to
contribute
a
small
amount
for
a
particular
charitable
purpose
and
the
whole
collection
usually
runs
up
to
a
snug
sum
practices
very
similar
to
this
were
quite
common
in
the
thirteenth
century
as
in
our
time
it
was
the
women
who
collected
the
money
a
rope
for
instance
was
stretched
across
a
marketplace
where
traffic
was
busy
and
everyone
who
passed
was
required
to
pay
a
toll
for
charity
occasionally
the
rope
was
stretched
across
a
bridge
and
the
tolls
were
collected
on
a
particular
day
each
year
other
forms
of
charitable
accumulation
resembled
ours
in
many
respects
entertainments
of
various
kinds
were
given
for
charity
and
special
collections
were
made
during
the
exhibition
of
mystery
plays
partly
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
representation
and
the
surplus
to
go
to
the
charities
of
the
particular
gild
most
of
the
charity
however
was
organized
indeed
it
is
the
organization
of
charity
during
the
thirteenth
century
that
represents
the
best
feature
of
its
fraternalism
the
needy
were
cared
for
by
the
gilds
themselves
there
were
practically
no
poorhouses
and
if
a
man
was
willing
to
work
and
had
already
shown
this
willingness
there
were
definite
bureaus
that
would
help
him
at
least
to
feed
his
family
while
he
was
out
of
work
this
system
however
was
flexible
enough
to
provide
also
for
the
the
tramps
the
beggars
but
they
were
given
not
money
but
tokens
which
enabled
them
to
obtain
the
necessaries
of
life
without
being
able
to
abuse
charity
the
committees
of
the
gilds
consulted
in
various
ways
among
themselves
and
with
the
church
wardens
so
as
to
be
sure
that
while
all
the
needy
were
receiving
help
no
one
was
abusing
charity
by
drawing
help
from
a
number
of
different
quarters
of
course
they
did
not
have
the
problem
of
large
city
life
that
we
have
and
so
their
comparatively
simple
organization
of
charity
sufficed
for
all
the
needs
of
the
time
and
at
the
same
time
anticipated
our
methods
viii
scientific
universities
in
the
first
edition
of
this
book
i
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
science
even
in
our
sense
of
physical
science
was
in
spite
of
impressions
to
the
contrary
a
favorite
subject
for
students
and
teachers
in
the
early
universities
what
might
have
been
insisted
on
however
is
that
these
old
universities
were
scientific
universities
resembling
our
own
so
closely
in
their
devotion
to
science
as
to
differ
from
them
only
in
certain
unimportant
aspects
because
the
universities
for
three
centuries
before
the
nineteenth
had
been
occupied
mainly
with
classical
studies
we
are
prone
to
think
that
these
were
the
main
subjects
of
university
teaching
for
all
the
centuries
before
nothing
could
well
be
less
true
the
undergraduate
studies
consisted
of
the
seven
liberal
arts
though
these
were
largely
studied
from
the
scientific
standpoint
the
quotation
from
huxley
appendix
education
makes
this
very
clear
what
we
would
now
call
the
graduate
studies
consisted
of
metaphysics
in
which
considerable
physics
were
studied
astronomy
medicine
above
all
mathematics
and
then
the
ethical
sciences
under
which
were
studied
what
we
now
call
ethics
politics
and
economics
the
picture
of
these
medieval
universities
as
i
have
given
them
in
my
lecture
on
medieval
scientific
universities
in
education
how
old
the
new
makes
this
very
clear
the
interests
and
studies
were
very
like
those
of
our
own
time
only
the
names
for
them
being
different
was
a
favorite
subject
and
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
the
popes
and
science
dante
must
be
considered
as
a
great
nature
student
for
he
was
able
to
draw
the
most
exquisite
figures
from
details
of
knowledge
of
living
things
with
which
few
poets
are
familiar
the
books
of
the
professors
of
the
thirteenth
century
which
have
been
preserved
those
of
albertus
magnus
roger
bacon
aquinas
duns
scotus
and
others
make
it
very
clear
that
scientific
teaching
was
the
main
occupation
of
the
university
faculties
while
the
preservation
of
these
huge
tomes
by
the
diligent
copying
of
disciples
shows
how
deeply
interested
were
their
pupils
in
the
science
of
the
time
ix
medical
teaching
and
professional
standards
at
all
times
in
the
history
of
education
the
standards
of
scientific
education
and
the
institutions
of
learning
can
be
best
judged
from
the
condition
of
the
medical
schools
when
the
medical
sciences
are
taken
seriously
when
thorough
preparation
is
demanded
before
their
study
may
be
taken
up
when
four
or
five
years
of
attention
to
theoretic
and
practical
medicine
are
required
for
graduation
and
when
the
professors
are
writing
textbooks
that
are
to
attract
attention
for
generations
afterwards
then
there
is
always
a
thoroughly
scientific
temper
m
the
university
itself
medicine
is
likely
to
suffer
first
whenever
there
is
neglect
of
science
the
studies
of
the
german
historians
puschmann
pagel
neuberger
and
sudhoff
in
recent
years
have
made
it
very
clear
that
the
medical
schools
of
the
universities
of
the
thirteenth
century
were
maintaining
high
standards
the
republication
of
old
texts
especially
in
france
has
called
attention
to
the
magnificent
publications
of
their
professors
while
a
review
of
their
laws
and
regulations
confirms
the
idea
of
the
good
work
that
was
being
done
gurlt
in
his
history
of
surgery
geschichte
der
chirurgie
berlin
has
reviewed
the
textbooks
of
roger
and
roland
and
the
four
masters
of
william
of
salicet
and
lanfranc
and
of
many
others
in
a
way
to
make
it
very
clear
that
these
men
were
excellent
teachers
when
we
discover
that
three
years
of
preparatory
university
work
was
required
before
the
study
of
medicine
could
be
begun
and
four
years
of
medical
studies
were
required
with
a
subsequent
year
of
practice
under
a
physician
direction
before
a
license
for
independent
practice
could
be
issued
then
the
scientific
character
of
the
medical
schools
and
therefore
of
the
universities
to
which
they
were
attached
is
placed
beyond
all
doubt
these
are
the
terms
of
the
law
issued
by
the
emperor
frederick
ii
for
the
two
sicilies
that
in
substance
it
applied
to
other
countries
we
learn
from
the
fact
that
the
charters
of
medical
schools
granted
by
the
popes
at
this
time
require
proper
university
preliminary
studies
and
four
or
five
years
at
medicine
before
the
degree
of
doctor
could
be
given
we
know
besides
that
in
the
cities
only
those
who
were
graduates
of
properly
recognized
medical
schools
were
allowed
to
practice
medicine
so
that
there
was
every
encouragement
for
the
maintenance
of
professional
standards
indeed
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
our
generation
the
standards
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
medical
education
were
much
higher
than
our
own
and
their
medical
schools
were
doing
fine
work

no
more
compendious
way
of
reaching
the

of
these
qualities
in

are
familiar
with

history
of

theory

few
know
however
that
certain
phases
of
evolutionary
theory
attracted
not
a
little
attention
from
the
scholastic
philosophers
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
expressions
in
roger
bacon
and
albertus
magnus
that
would
serve
to
show
that
they
thought
not
only
of
the
possibility
of
some
very
intimate
relation
of
species
but
of
developmental
connections
the
great
teacher
of
the
time
thomas
aquinas
has
some
striking
expressions
in
the
matter
which
deserve
to
be
quoted
because
he
is
the
most
important
representative
of
the
philosophy
and
science
of
the
century
and
the
one
whose
works
most
influenced
succeeding
generations
in

lecture
on
medieval
scientific
universities
published
in
education
how
old
the
new
fordham
university

i
called
particular
attention
to
this
phase
of
thomas
teaching
two
quotations
will
serve
to
make
it
clear
here
osborne
in
from
the
greeks
to
darwin
quotes
commentary
on
augustine
opinion
with
regard
to
the
origin
of
things
as
they
are
augustine
declared
that
the
creator
had
simply
brought
into
life
the
seeds
of
things
and
given
these
the
power
to
develop
aquinas
expounding
augustine
says
as
to
production
of
plants
augustine
holds
a
different
view
for
some
say
that
on
the
third
day
plants
were
actually
produced
each
in
his
kind
a
view
favored
by
the
superficial
reading
of
scripture
but
augustine
says
that
the
earth
is
then
said
to
have
brought
forth
grass
and
trees
that
is
it
then
received
power
to
produce
them
quoting
genesis
for
in
those
first
days
god
made
creation
primarily
or
and
then
rested
from
his
work
like
expressions
might
be
quoted
from
him
and
other
writers
of
the
thirteenth
century
might
well
be
cited
in
confirmation
of
the
fact
that
while
these
great
teachers
of
the
middle
ages
thoroughly
recognize
the
necessity
for
creation
to
begin
with
and
the
placing
by
the
creator
of
some
power
in
living
things
that
enables
them
to
develop
they
were
by
no
means
bound
to
the
thought
that
all
living
species
were
due
to
special
creations
they
even
did
not
hesitate
to
teach
the
possibility
of
the
lower
order
of
living
beings
at
least
coming
into
existence
by
spontaneous
generation
and
would
probably
have
found
no
difficulty
in
accepting
a
theory
of
descent
with
the
limitations
that
most
scientific
men
of
our
generation
are
prone
to
demand
for
it
lest
it
should
be
thought
that
this
is
a
mere
accidental
agreement
with
modern
thought
due
much
more
to
a
certain
looseness
of
terms
than
to
actual
similarity
of
view
it
seems
well
to
point
out
how
close
thomas
came
to
that
thought
in
modern
biology
which
is
probably
considered
to
be
one
of
our
distinct
modern
contributions
to
the
theory
of
evolution
though
in
recent
years
serious
doubts
have
been
thrown
on
it
it
is
expressed
by
the
formula
of
herbert
spencer
ontogeny
recapitulates
phylogeny
according
to
this
the
completed
being
repeats
in
the
course
of
its
development
the
history
of
the
race
that
is
to
say
the
varying
phases
of
foetal
development
from
the
single
cell
in
which
it
originates
up
to
the
perfect
being
of
the
special
type
as
it
is
born
into
the
world
retrace
the
history
by
which
from
the
single
cell
being
the
creature
in
question
has
gradually
developed
it
is
very
curious
to
find
that
thomas
aquinas
in
his
teaching
with
regard
to
the
origin
and
development
of
the
human
being
says
almost
exactly
what
the
most
ardent
supporters
of
this
fundamental
biogenetic
law
proclaimed
during
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
thinking
they
were
expressing
an
absolutely
new
thought
he
says
that
the
higher
a
form
is
in
the
scale
of
being
and
the
farther
it
is
removed
from
mere
material
form
the
more
intermediate
forms
must
be
passed
through
before
the
finally
perfect
form
is
reached
therefore
in
the
generation
of
animal
and
man
these
having
the
most
perfect
forms
there
occur
many
intermediate
forms
in
generations
and
consequently
destruction
because
the
generation
of
one
being
is
the
destruction
of
another
thomas
draws
the
ultimate
conclusions
from
this
doctrine
without
hesitation
he
proclaims
that
the
human
material
is
first
animated
by
a
vegetative
soul
or
principle
of
life
and
then
by
an
animal
soul
and
only
ultimately
when
the
matter
has
been
properly
prepared
for
it
by
a
rational
soul
he
said
the
vegetative
soul
therefore
which
is
first
in
embryo
while
it
lives
the
life
of
a
plant
is
destroyed
and
there
succeeds
a
more
perfect
soul
which
is
at
once
nutrient
and
sentient
and
for
that
time
the
embryo
lives
the
life
of
an
animal
upon
the
destruction
of
this
there
succeeds
the
rational
soul
infused
from
without
xii
the
pope
of
the
century
the
absence
of
a
chapter
on
the
pope
of
the
century
has
always
seemed
a
lacuna
in
the
previous
editions
of
this
book
pope
innocent
whose
pontificate
began
just
before
the
century
opened
and
occupied
the
first
fifteen
years
of
it
well
deserves
a
place
beside
francis
the
saint
thomas
the
scholar
dante
the
poet
and
louis
the
monarch
of
this
great
century
more
than
any
other
single
individual
he
was
responsible
for
the
great
development
of
the
intellectual
life
that
took
place
but
at
the
same
time
his
wonderfully
broad
influence
enabled
him
to
initiate
many
of
the
movements
that
meant
most
for
human
uplift
and
for
the
alleviation
of
suffering
in
this
period
it
was
in
councils
of
the
church
summoned
by
him
that
the
important
legislation
was
passed
requiring
the
development
of
schools
the
foundation
of
colleges
in
every
diocese
and
of
universities
in
important
metropolitan
sees
what
he
accomplished
for
hospitals
has
been
well
told
by
virchow
from
whom
i
quote
a
magnanimous
tribute
in
the
chapter
on
the
foundation
of
city
hospitals
the
legislation
of
innocent
iii
did
much
to
encourage
and
yet
to
regulate
properly
the
religious
orders
of
this
time
engaged
in
charitable
work
besides
doing
so
much
for
charity
he
was
a
stern
upholder
of
morals
as
more
than
one
king
of
the
time
realized
while
innocent
was
pope
there
could
be
no
trifling
with
marriage
vows
on
the
other
hand
while
innocent
was
so
stern
as
to
the
enforcement
of
marriage
laws
his
wonderfully
judicious
character
and
his
care
for
the
weak
and
the
innocent
can
be
particularly
noted
in
his
treatment
of
the
children
in
these
cases
while
he
compelled
recalcitrant
kings
to
take
back
the
wives
they
would
repudiate
and
put
away
other
women
who
had
won
their
affections
he
did
not
hesitate
to
make
due
provision
as
far
as
possible
for
the
illegitimate
children
pirie
gordon
in
his
recent
life
of
pope
innocent
notes
that
he
invariably
legitimated
the
offspring
of
these
illegal
unions
of
kings
and
even
declared
them
capable
of
succession
he
would
not
visit
the
guilt
of
the
parent
on
the
innocent
offspring
innocent
did
more
to
encourage
the
idea
of
international
arbitration
than
anyone
up
to
his
time
during
his
period
more
than
once
he
was
the
arbitrator
to
whom
rival
national
claims
that
might
have
led
to
war
were
referred
probably
his
greatest
claim
on
our
admiration
in
the
modern
time
is
his
attitude
toward
the
jews
in
this
he
is
centuries
ahead
of
his
time
and
indeed
the
policy
that
he
laid
down
is
far
ahead
of
what
is
accorded
to
them
by
many
of
the
nations
even
at
the
present
time
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
it
is
only
during
the
past
hundred
years
that
the
jew
has
come
to
have
any
real
privileges
comparable
to
those
accorded
to
other
men
at
a
time
when
the
jew
had
no
real
rights
in
law
innocent
insisted
on
according
them
all
the
rights
of
men
his
famous
edict
in
this
regard
is
well
known
let
no
christian
by
violence
compel
them
to
come
dissenting
or
unwilling
to
baptism
further
let
no
christian
venture
maliciously
to
harm
their
persons
without
a
judgment
of
the
civil
power
to
carry
off
their
property
or
change
their
good
customs
which
they
have
had
hitherto
in
that
district
which
they
inhabit
when
in
addition
to
all
this
it
is
recalled
that
he
was
a
distinguished
scholar
and
graduate
of
the
university
of
paris
looked
up
to
as
one
of
the
intellectual
geniuses
of
the
time
the
author
of
a
treatise
on
the
contempt
of
the
world
at
a
time
when
the
kings
of
the
earth
were
obeying
him
known
for
his
personal
piety
and
for
his
thorough
regulation
of
his
own
household
something
of
the
greatness
of
the
man
will
be
appreciated
no
wonder
that
historians
who
have
taken
up
the
special
study
of
his
career
have
always
been
won
over
to
deep
personal
admiration
of
him
and
though
many
of
them
began
prejudiced
in
his
regard
practically
all
of
them
were
converted
to
be
his
sincere
admirers
xiii
international
arbitration
during
the
peace
conference
in
new
york
in
i
was
on
the
programme
with
william
stead
of
london
the
editor
of
the
english
of
who
was
very
much
interested
in
the
volume
on
the
thirteenth
century
and
who
suggested
that
one
chapter
in
the
book
should
have
been
devoted
to
the
consideration
of
what
was
accomplished
for
peace
and
for
international
arbitration
during
this
century
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
developed
as
the
result
of
many
papal
decrees
a
greater
tendency
than
has
existed
ever
before
or
since
to
refer
quarrels
between
nations
that
would
ordinarily
end
in
war
to
decision
by
some
selected
umpire
usually
the
pope
as
the
head
of
the
christian
church
to
which
all
the
nations
of
the
civilized
world
belonged
was
selected
as
the
arbitrator
this
international
arbitration
strengthened
by
the
decrees
of
pope
innocent
pope
honorius
iii
and
pope
alexander
developed
in
a
way
that
is
well
worth
while
studying
and
that
has
deservedly
been
the
subject
of
careful
investigation
since
the
present
peace
movement
began
certainly
the
outlook
for
the
securing
of
peace
by
international
arbitration
was
better
at
this
time
than
it
has
been
at
any
time
since
what
a
striking
example
for
instance
is
the
choice
of
king
louis
of
france
as
the
umpire
in
the
dispute
between
the
barons
and
the
king
of
england
which
might
have
led
to
war
louis
position
with
regard
to
the
empire
and
the
papacy
was
to
a
great
extent
that
of
a
pacificator
and
his
influence
for
peace
was
felt
everywhere
throughout
europe
the
spirit
of
the
century
was
all
for
arbitration
and
the
adjudication
of
intranational
as
well
as
international
difficulties
by
peaceful
means
xiv
bible
revision
most
people
will
be
quite
sure
that
at
least
the
question
of
bible
revision
with
critical
study
of
text
and
comparative
investigation
of
sources
was
reserved
for
our
time
the
two
orders
of
friars
founded
in
the
early
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
however
devoted
themselves
to
the
task
of
supplying
to
the
people
a
thoroughly
reliable
edition
of
the
scriptures
the
first
systematic
revision
was
made
by
the
dominicans
about
after
twenty
years
this
revision
was
set
aside
as
containing
too
many
errors
and
another
dominican
correction
replaced
it
then
came
that
great
scholar
hugh
of
cher
known
later
as
the
cardinal
of
santa
sabina
the
author
of
the
first
great
biblical
concordance
his
bible
studies
did
much
to
clarify
obscurities
in
the
text
sometime
about
he
organized
a
commission
of
friars
for
the
revision
of
what
was
known
as
the
paris
exemplar
the
bible
text
that
was
most
in
favor
at
that
time
the
aim
of
hugh
of
cher
was
to
establish
the
old
vulgate
of
jerome
the
text
which
received
this
name
during
this
century
but
with
such
revision
as
would
make
this
version
correspond
as
nearly
as
possible
to
the
hebrew
and
the
greek
this
activity
on
the
part
of
the
dominicans
was
rivaled
by
the
franciscans
we
might
not
expect
to
find
the
great
scientist
roger
bacon
as
a
biblical
scholar
and
reviser
but
such
he
was
working
with
willermus
de
mara
to
whom
according
to
father
denifle
late
the
librarian
of
the
vatican
library
must
be
attributed
the
title
given
him
by
roger
bacon
of
sapientissimus
vir
the
dominicans
under
the
leadership
of
hugh
of
cher
with
high
ideals
had
hoped
to
achieve
a
perfect
primitive
text
the
version
made
by
de
mara
however
with
the
approval
and
advice
of
bacon
was
only
meant
to
bring
out
text
as
perfectly
as
possible
these
two
revisions
made
in
the
thirteenth
century
are
typical
of
all
the
efforts
that
men
have
made
since
in
that
same
direction
contrary
to
usual
present
day
impressions
they
are
characterized
by
critical
scholarship
and
probably
represent
as
great
a
contribution
to
biblical
lore
as
was
made
by
any
other
century
xv
fiction
of
the
century
ordinarily
it
would
be
presumed
that
life
was
taken
entirely
too
seriously
during
the
thirteenth
century
for
the
generation
to
pay
much
attention
to
fiction
in
a
certain
sense
this
is
true
in
the
sense
however
that
they
had
no
stories
worthy
of
the
great
literature
in
other
departments
it
would
be
quite
untrue
there
is
a
naiveté
about
their
story
telling
that
rather
amuses
our
sophisticated
age
yet
all
the
elements
of
our
modern
fiction
are
to
be
found
in
the
stories
that
were
popular
during
the
century
and
arranged
with
a
dramatic
effect
that
must
have
given
them
a
wide
appeal
the
most
important
contribution
to
the
fiction
of
the
century
is
to
be
found
in
the
collection
known
as
the
novelle
or
hundred
ancient
tales
which
contains
the
earliest
prose
fiction
extant
in
italian
many
of
these
come
from
a
period
anterior
to
dante
and
it
is
probable
from
what
manni
the
learned
editor
of
the
says
that
they
were
written
out
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
collected
in
the
early
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
they
did
not
all
originate
in
italy
and
indeed
manni
considers
that
most
of
them
derived
their
origin
from
provence
they
represent
the
interest
of
the
century
in
fiction
and
in
anecdotal
literature
as
for
the
longer
fiction
the
pure
love
story
of
the
modern
time
we
have
one
typical
example
of
it
in
that
curious
relic
of
the
middle
ages
aucassin
and
nicolette
the
manuscript
which
preserved
this
for
us
comes
from
the
thirteenth
century
perhaps
as
paris
suggests
the
tale
itself
is
from
the
preceding
century
at
least
it
was
the
interest
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
it
that
saved
it
for
us
for
those
who
think
that
the
love
romance
in
any
of
its
features
is
novel
though
we
call
it
by
that
name
or
that
there
has
been
any
development
of
human
nature
which
enables
the
writer
of
love
stories
to
appeal
to
other
and
deeper
or
purer
and
loftier
feelings
in
his
loved
ones
now
than
in
the
past
all
that
is
needed
as
it
seems
to
me
is
a
casual
reading
of
this
pretty
old
perhaps
the
most
interesting
feature
of
this
oldest
specimen
of
modern
fiction
is
the
number
of
precious
bits
of
psychologic
analysis
or
at
least
what
is
called
that
in
the
recent
time
which
occur
in
the
course
of
it
for
instance
when
aucassin
is
grieving
because
he
can
not
find
nicolette
he
wanders
through
the
forest
on
horseback
and
is
torn
by
trees
and
brambles
but
he
feels
it
not
at
all
on
the
other
hand
when
he
finds
nicolette
though
he
is
suffering
from
a
dislocated
shoulder
he
no
longer
feels
any
pain
in
it
because
of
his
joy
at
the
meeting
and
nicolette
first
aid
to
the
injured
is
able
to
replace
the
dislocated
part
without
difficulty
the
trained
nurse
in
fiction
because
he
is
so
happy
as
not
to
notice
the
pain
psychotherapy
the
herdsman
whom
he
meets
wonders
that
aucassin
with
plenty
of
money
and
victuals
should
grieve
so
much
over
the
loss
of
nicolette
while
he
has
so
much
more
cause
to
grieve
over
the
loss
of
an
ox
which
means
starvation
to
him
toward
the
end
of
the
story
we
have
the
scene
in
which
nicolette
stolen
from
home
when
very
young
and
utterly
unable
to
remember
anything
about
her
childhood
has
brought
back
to
her
memory
by
the
view
of
the
city
of
carthage
forgotten
events
of
her
childhood
subconscious
memory
these
represent
naively
enough
it
is
true
the
study
of
the
mind
under
varying
conditions
that
has
in
recent
years
been
given
the
rather
ambitious
name
of
psychology
in
fiction
xvi
great
orators
without
a
chapter
on
the
great
orators
of
the
period
an
account
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
quite
incomplete
great
as
were
the
other
forms
of
literature
epic
lyric
and
religious
poetry
and
the
prose
writing
it
is
probable
that
the
oratory
of
the
time
surpassed
them
all
when
we
recall
that
the
cid
the
arthur
legends
the
nibelungen
the
meistersingers
and
the
minnesingers
reynard
the
fox
the
romance
of
the
rose
the
troubadours
and
even
dante
are
included
in
the
other
term
of
the
comparison
thus
made
it
may
seem
extravagant
but
what
we
know
of
the
effect
of
the
orators
of
the
time
fully
justifies
it
just
before
the
thirteenth
century
great
religious
orators
swayed
the
hearts
and
minds
of
people
to
the
organization
of
the
crusades
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
mendicant
orders
were
organized
and
their
important
duties
were
preaching
and
teaching
the
dominicans
were
of
course
the
order
of
preachers
and
we
have
traditions
of
their
sway
over
the
minds
of
the
people
of
the
time
which
make
it
very
clear
that
their
power
was
equal
to
that
exerted
in
any
other
department
of
human
expression
there
are
traditions
particularly
of
the
oratory
of
the
dominicans
among
the
german
races
which
serve
to
show
how
even
a
phlegmatic
people
can
be
stirred
to
the
very
depths
of
their
being
by
the
eloquent
spoken
word
in
france
the
traditions
are
almost
as
explicit
in
this
matter
and
there
are
remains
of
religious
orations
that
fully
confirm
the
reputation
of
the
orators
of
the
time
rhetoric
and
oratory
was
studied
very
assiduously
cicero
was
the
favorite
reading
of
the
great
preachers
of
the
time
and
we
find
the
court
preachers
of
louis
étienne
de
bourbon
elinand
guillaume
de
perrault
and
others
appealing
to
his
precepts
as
the
infallible
guide
to
oratory
quintilian
was
not
neglected
however
and
symmachus
and
sidonius
apollinaris
were
also
faithfully
studied
if
we
turn
to
the
speeches
that
are
incorporated
in
the
epics
as
for
instance
the
cid
or
in
some
of
the
historians
as
villehardouin
we
have
definite
evidence
of
the
thorough
command
of
the
writers
of
the
time
over
the
forms
of
oratory
paullin
paris
the
authority
in
our
time
on
the
literature
of
the
thirteenth
century
quotes
a
passage
from
villehardouin
in
which
canon
de
bethune
speaks
in
the
name
of
the
french
chiefs
of
the
fourth
crusade
to
the
emperors
isaac
and
alexis
comnenus
paris
does
not
hesitate
to
declare
that
the
passage
is
equal
to
many
of
the
same
kind
that
have
been
much
admired
in
the
classic
authors
it
has
the
force
the
finish
and
the
compression
of
thucydides
xvii
great
beginnings
in
english
literature
only
the
fact
that
this
work
was
getting
beyond
the
number
of
printed
pages
determined
for
it
in
the
first
edition
prevented
the
insertion
of
a
chapter
especially
devoted
to
the
great
beginnings
of
english
literature
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
most
important
contributions
to
early
english
were
made
at
this
period
the
ormulum
and
brut
both
written
probably
during
the
first
decade
of
the
thirteenth
century
have
become
familiar
to
all
students
of
old
english
gollancz
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
ormulum
is
perhaps
the
most
valuable
document
we
possess
for
the
history
of
english
sound
orm
was
a
purist
in
orthography
as
well
as
in

and
may
fittingly
be
described
as
the

phoneticians

of
ormulum

century
of
layamon
garnett
said
in
his
english
literature
garnett
and
gosse
it
would
have
sufficed
for
the
fame
of
layamon
had
he
been
no
more
than
the
first
minstrel
to
celebrate
arthur
in
english
song
but
his
own
pretensions
as
a
poet
are
by
no
means
inconsiderate
he
is
everywhere
vigorous
and
graphic
and
improved
upon
his
predecessor
wace
alike
by
his
additions
and
expansions
and
by
his
more
spiritual
handling
of
the
subjects
common
to
both
even
more
important
in
the
history
of
language
than
these
is
ancren
the
rule
this
was
probably
written
by
richard
poore
bishop
of
salisbury
for
three
cistercian
nuns
its
place
in
english
literature
may
be
judged
from
a
quotation
or
two
with
regard
to
it
says
ancren
is
the
forerunner
of
a
wondrous
change
in
our
speech
more
than
anything
else
written
outside
the
danelagh
that
piece
has
influenced
our
standard
english
garnett
says
ancren
is
a
work
of
great
literary
merit
and
in
spite
of
its
linguistic
innovations
most
of
which
have
established
themselves
well
deserves
to
be
described
as
of
the
most
perfect
models
of
simple
eloquent
prose
in
our
language
the
religious
poetry
of
the
time
is
not
behind
the
great
prose
of
ancren
and
one
of
them
the
love
song
of
thomas
de
hales
is
very
akin
to
the
spirit
of
that
work
and
has
been
well
described
as
a
contemplative
lyric
of
the
simplest
noblest
mold
garnett
says
the
reflections
are
such
as
are
common
to
all
who
have
in
all
ages
pleaded
for
the
higher
life
under
whatsoever
form
and
deplored
the
frailty
and
transitoriness
of
man
earthly
estate
two
stanzas
on
the
latter
theme
as
expressed
in
a
modernized
version
might
almost
pass
for
villon
paris
and
helen
where
are
they
fairest
in
beauty
bright
to
view

great
origins
in
music
in
the
chapter
on
the
great
latin
hymns
a
few
words
were
said
about
one
phase
of
the
important
musical
development
in
the
thirteenth
century
that
of
plain
chant
in
that
simple
mode
the
musicians
of
the
thirteenth
century
succeeded
in
reaching
a
climax
of
expression
of
human
feeling
in
such
chants
as
the
and
the
that
has
never
been
surpassed
something
was
also
said
about
the
origin
of
part
music
but
so
little
that
it
might
easily
be
thought
that
in
this
the
century
lagged
far
behind
its
achievements
in
other
departments
m
pierre
aubry
has
recently
published
motets
du
xiiie
in
three
volumes
his
first
volume
contains
a
photographic
reproduction
of
the
manuscript
of
bamberg
from
which
the
hundred
musical
modes
are
secured
the
second
a
transcription
in
modern
musical
notation
of
the
old
music
and
the
third
volume
studies
and
commentaries
on
the
music
and
the
times
if
anything
were
needed
to
show
how
utterly
ignorant
we
have
been
of
the
interests
and
artistic
achievements
of
the
middle
ages
it
is
this
book
of
aubry
victor
hugo
said
that
music
dates
from
the
sixteenth
century
and
it
has
been
quite
the
custom
even
for
people
who
thought
they
knew
something
about
music
to
declare
that
we
had
no
remains
of
any
music
before
the
sixteenth
century
worth
while
talking
about
ancient
music
is
probably
lost
to
us
forever
but
aubry
has
shown
conclusively
that
we
have
abundant
remains
to
show
us
that
the
musicians
of
the
thirteenth
century
devoted
themselves
to
their
art
with
as
great
success
as
their
rivals
in
the
other
gothic
arts
and
indeed
they
thought
that
they
had
nearly
exhausted
its
possibilities
and
tried
to
make
a
science
of
it
by
their
supposedly
scientific
rules
they
succeeded
in
binding
music
so
firmly
as
to
bring
about
its
obscuration
in
succeeding
centuries
this
is
however
the
old
story
of
what
has
happened
in
every
art
whenever
genius
succeeds
in
finding
a
great
mode
of
expression
a
formula
is
evolved
which
often
binds
expression
so
rigorously
as
to
prevent
natural
development
xix
a
chapter
on
manners
whatever
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
may
have
been
in
morals
their
manners
are
supposed
to
have
been
about
as
lacking
in
refinement
as
possible
as
for
nearly
everything
else
however
this
impression
is
utterly
false
and
is
due
to
the
assumption
that
because
we
are
than
the
generations
of
a
century
or
two
ago
therefore
we
must
be
almost
infinitely
in
advance
in
the
same
respect
of
the
people
of
seven
centuries
ago
there
are
ups
and
downs
in
manners
however
as
there
are
in
education
and
the
beginnings
of
the
formal
setting
forth
of
modern
manners
are
like
everything
else
modern
to
be
found
in
the
thirteenth
century
about
the
year
thomasin
zerklaere
wrote
in
german
a
rather
lengthy
treatise
wälsche
on
manners
it
contains
most
of
the
details
of
polite
conduct
that
have
been
accepted
in
later
times
not
long
afterwards
john
garland
an
oxford
man
who
had
lived
in
france
for
many
years
wrote
a
book
on
manners
for
english
young
men
he
meant
this
to
be
a
supplement
to
dionysius
cato
treatise
written
probably
in
the
fourth
century
in
latin
which
was
concerned
more
with
morals
than
manners
and
had
been
very
popular
during
the
middle
ages
book
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
such
treatises
on
manners
which
appeared
in
england
at
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
many
of
them
have
been
recently
republished
and
are
a
revelation
of
the
development
of
manners
among
our
english
forefathers
the
book
is
usually
alluded
to
in
literature
as
liber
faceti
or
as
facet
the
full
title
was
the
book
of
the
polite
man
teaching
manners
for
men
especially
for
boys
as
a
supplement
to
those
which
were
omitted
by
the
most
moral
cato
the
romance
of
the
rose
has
of
course
many
references
to
manners
which
show
us
how
courtesy
was
cultivated
in
france
in
italy
teacher
bruneto
latini
published
his
tesoretto
which
treats
of
manners
and
which
was
soon
followed
by
a
number
of
similar
treatises
in
italian
in
a
word
we
must
look
to
the
thirteenth
century
for
the
origin
or
at
least
the
definite
acceptance
of
most
of
those
conventions
which
make
for
kindly
courtesy
among
men
and
have
made
possible
human
society
and
friendly
intercourse
in
our
modern
sense
of
those
words
we
are
prone
to
think
that
refinement
in
table
manners
is
a
matter
of
distinctly
modern
times
in
the
babees
book
which
is
one
of
the
oldest
books
of
english
manners
the
date
of
which
in
its
present
form
is
about
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
many
of
our
rules
of
politeness
at
table
are
anticipated
this
book
is
usually
looked
upon
as
a
compilation
from
preceding
times
and
the
original
of
it
is
supposed
to
be
from
the
preceding
century
a
few
quotations
from
it
will
show
how
closely
it
resembles
our
own
instructions
to
children
thou
shalt
not
laugh
nor
speak
nothing
while
thy
mouth
be
full
of
meat
or
drink
nor
sup
thou
not
with
great
sounding
neither
pottage
nor
other
thing
at
meat
cleanse
not
thy
teeth
nor
pick
with
knife
or
straw
or
wand
or
stick
while
thou
holdest
meat
in
mouth
beware
to
drink
that
is
an
unhonest
chare
and
also
physic
forbids
it
quite
also
eschew
without
strife
to
foul
the
board
cloth
with
thy
knife
nor
blow
not
on
thy
drink
or
meat
neither
for
cold
neither
for
heat
nor
bear
with
meat
thy
knife
to
mouth
whether
thou
be
set
by
strong
or
couth
lean
not
on
elbow
at
thy
meat
neither
for
cold
nor
for
heat
dip
not
thy
thumb
thy
drink
into
thou
art
uncourteous
if
thou
it
do
in
if
thou
put
or
fish
or
flesh
that
men
see
it
that
is
a
vice
as
men
me
tells
and
great
wonder
it
would
be
else
the
directions
how
to
behave
thyself
in
talking
with
any
man
in
one
of
these
old
books
are
very
minute
and
specific
if
a
man
demand
a
question
of
thee
in
thine
answer
making
be
not
too
hasty
weigh
well
his
words
the
case
understand
ere
an
answer
to
make
thou
take
in
hand
else
may
he
judge
in
thee
little
wit
to
answer
to
a
thing
and
not
hear
it
suffer
his
tale
whole
out
to
be
told
then
speak
thou
mayst
and
not
be
controlled
in
audible
voice
thy
words
do
thou
utter
not
high
nor
low
but
using
a
measure
thy
words
see
that
thou
pronounce
plaine
and
that
they
spoken
be
not
in
vain
in
uttering
whereon
keep
thou
an
order
thy
matter
thereby
thou
shalt
much
forder
which
order
if
thou
do
not
observe
from
the
purpose
needs
must
thou
swerve
xx
textile
work
of
the
century
a
special
chapter
might
easily
have
been
written
on
the
making
of
fine
cloths
of
various
kinds
most
of
which
reached
their
highest
perfection
in
the
thirteenth
century
velvet
for
instance
is
mentioned
for
the
first
time
in
england
in
but
existed
earlier
on
the
continent
and
cut
velvets
with
elaborate
patterns
were
made
in
genoa
exactly
as
we
know
finished
velvet
now
baudekin
or
baldichin
a
very
costly
textile
of
gold
and
silk
largely
used
in
altar
coverings
and
hangings
came
to
very
high
perfection
in
this
century
also
the
canopy
for
the
blessed
sacrament
is
because
of
its
manufacture
from
this
cloth
still
called
in
italy
a
chaucer
in
the
next
century
tells
how
the
streets
in
royal
processions
were
hanged
with
cloth
of
gold
and
not
with
serge
satin
also
was
first
manufactured
very
probably
in
the
thirteenth
century
it
is
first
mentioned
in
england
about
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
when
bishop
grandison
made
a
gift
of
choice
satins
to
exeter
cathedral
the
word
satin
however
is
derived
from
the
silks
of
the
mediterranean
called
by
the
italians
and
by
the
spanish
and
the
art
of
making
it
was
brought
to
perfection
during
the
preceding
century
the
art
of
making
textiles
ornamented
with
elaborate
designs
of
animal
forms
and
of
floral
ornaments
reached
its
highest
perfection
in
the
thirteenth
century
in
one
of
the
chronicles
we
learn
that
in
paul
in
london
owned
a
hanging
patterned
with
wheels
and
birds
we
have
accounts
of
such
elaborate
textile
ornamentation
as
peacocks
lions
griffins
and
the
like
almeria
in
andalusia
was
a
rich
city
in
the
thirteenth
century
noted
for
its
manufactures
of
textiles
a
historian
of
the
period
writes
christians
of
all
nations
came
to
its
port
to
buy
and
sell
then
they
traveled
to
other
parts
of
the
interior
of
the
country
where
they
loaded
their
vessels
with
such
goods
as
they
wanted
costly
silken
robes
of
the
brightest
colors
are
manufactured
in
almeria
says
of
the
persians
that
when
he
passed
through
that
country
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
there
are
excellent
artificers
in
the
city
who
make
wonderful
things
in
gold
silk
and
embroidery
the
women
make
excellent
needlework
in
silk
with
all
sorts
of
creatures
very
admirably
wrought
therein
he
also
reports
the
king
of
tartary
as
wearing
on
his
birthday
a
most
precious
garment
of
gold
and
tells
of
the
girdles
of
gold
and
silver
with
pearls
and
ornaments
of
great
price
on
them
unfortunately
english
embroidery
fell
off
very
greatly
at
the
time
of
the
wars
of
the
roses
these
wars
constitute
the
main
reason
why
nearly
every
form
of
intellectual
accomplishment
and
artistic
achievement
went
into
decadence
during
the
fourteenth
century
from
which
they
were
only
just
emerging
when
the
reformation
with
its
confiscation
of
monastic
property
and
its
destruction
of
monastic
life
came
to
ruin
schools
of
all
kinds
and
above
all
those
in
which
the
arts
and
crafts
had
been
taught
so
successfully
france
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
saw
a
similar
rise
to
excellence
of
textile
and
embroidery
work
in
there
is
an
allusion
to
one
clément
le
brodeur
who
furnished
a
magnificent
cope
for
the
count
of
artois
in
a
beautifully
decorated
set
of
hangings
was
made
for
the
queen
by
gautier
de
poulleigny
there
are
other
references
to
work
done
in
the
early
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
which
serve
to
show
the
height
which
art
had
reached
in
this
mode
during
the
thirteenth
century
in
ireland
while
the
finer
work
had
its
due
place
the
making
of
woolens
was
the
specialty
and
the
dyeing
of
woolen
cloth
made
the
irish
famous
and
brought
many
travelers
from
the
continent
to
learn
the
secret
the
work
done
in
england
in
embroidery
attracted
the
attention
of
the
world
english
needlework
became
a
proverb
in
the
body
of
the
book
i
mentioned
the
cope
of
ascoli
but
there
were
many
such
beautiful
garments
the
syon
cope
is
in
the
opinion
of
miss
addison
author
of
arts
and
crafts
in
the
middle
ages
the
most
conspicuous
example
of
the
medieval
embroiderers
art
it
was
made
by
nuns
about
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
is
just
about
the
same
time
as
the
cope
of
ascoli
but
in
a
convent
near
coventry
according
to
miss
addison
it
is
solid
stitchery
on
a
canvas
ground
wrought
about
with
divers
colors
on
green
the
design
is
laid
out
in
a
series
of
interlacing
square
forms
with
rounded
and
barbed
sides
and
corners
in
each
of
these
is
a
figure
or
a
scriptural
scene
the
orphreys
or
straight
borders
which
go
down
on
both
fronts
of
the
cope
are
decorated
with
heraldic
charges
much
of
the
embroidery
is
raised
and
wrought
in
the
stitch
known
as
opus
anglicanum
the
effect
was
produced
by
pressing
a
heated
metal
knob
into
the
work
at
such
points
as
were
to
be
raised
the
real
embroidery
was
executed
on
a
flat
surface
and
then
bossed
up
by
this
means
until
it
looked
like
the
stitches
in
every
part
run
in
the
vestments
and
even
the
nimbi
about
the
heads
are
all
executed
with
the
stitches
slanting
in
one
direction
from
the
center
of
the
cope
outward
without
consideration
of
the
positions
of
the
figures
each
face
is
worked
in
circular
progression
outward
from
the
center
as
well
the
interlaces
are
of
crimson
and
look
well
on
the
green
ground
the
wheeled
cherubim
is
well
developed
in
the
design
of
this
famous
cope
and
is
a
pleasing
decorative
bit
of
archaic
ecclesiasticism
in
the
central
design
of
the
crucifixion
the
figure
of
the
lord
is
rendered
in
silver
on
a
gold
ground
xxi
a
chapter
might
well
have
been
devoted
to
thirteenth
century
quite
apart
from
the
stained
glass
of
the
cathedral
windows
all
over
europe
some
of
the
most
wonderful
specimens
of
colored
glass
we
possess
were
made
in
the
thirteenth
century
recently
frederick
rolfe
has
looked
up
for
me
venetian
glass
of
the
three
centuries
the
twelfth
the
thirteenth
and
the
fourteenth
he
says
twelfth
century
glass
is
small
in
form
simple
and
ignorant
in
model
excessively
rich
and
brilliant
in
colors
the
artist
evidently
had
no
ideal
but
the
byzantine
of
jewels
and
emeralds
thirteenth
century
glass
is
absolutely
different
the
specimens
are
pretty
the
work
of
the
beroviero
family
is
large
and
splendid
in
form
exquisite
and
sometimes
elaborate
in
model
mostly
crystal
glass
reticently
studded
with
tiny
colored
knobs
there
are
also
fragments
of
two
windows
pieced
together
and
missing
parts
filled
with
the
best
which
modern
murano
can
do
these
show
the
celebrated
beroviero
ruby
glass
secret
lost
of
marvelous
depth
and
brilliancy
in
comparison
with
which
the
modern
work
is
merely
watery
the
ancient
is
just
like
a
decanter
of
fourteenth
century
returns
to
the
wriggling
ideal
and
exiguous
form
of
the
twelfth
century
and
fails
woefully
in
brilliance
of
color
it
is
small
and
dull
and
undistinguished
one
may
find
out
what
war
or
pest
afflicted
murano
at
this
epoch
to
explain
the
singular
degradation
this
same
curious
degradation
took
place
in
the
manufacture
of
most
art
objects
during
the
fourteenth
century
one
would
feel
in
rolfe
words
like
looking
for
some
physical
cause
for
it
the
decadence
is
so
universal
however
that
it
seems
not
unlikely
that
it
follows
some
little
known
human
law
according
to
which
after
man
has
reached
a
certain
perfection
of
expression
in
an
art
or
craft
there
comes
in
the
striving
after
originality
yet
variety
an
overbalancing
of
the
judgment
a
vitiation
of
the
taste
in
the
very
luxuriance
of
beauty
discovered
that
leads
to
decay
it
is
the
very
contradiction
of
the
supposed
progress
of
mankind
through
evolution
but
it
is
illustrated
in
many
phases
of
human
history
and
above
all
the
history
of
art
letters
education
and
the
arts
and
crafts
xxii
inventions
most
people
are
sure
to
think
that
at
least
in
the
matter
of
inventions
ours
is
the
only
time
worth
considering
the
people
of
the
thirteenth
century
however
made
many
wonderful
inventions
and
adaptations
of
mechanical
principles
as
well
as
many
ingenious
appliances
their
faculty
of
invention
was
mainly
devoted
to
work
in
other
departments
besides
that
of
mechanics
they
were
inventors
of
designs
in
architecture
in
decoration
in
furnishings
in
textiles
and
in
the
beautiful
things
of
life
generally
their
inventiveness
in
the
arts
and
crafts
was
especially
admirable
and
indeed
has
been
fruitful
in
our
time
since
with
the
reawakening
in
this
matter
we
have
gone
back
to
imitate
their
designs
good
authorities
declare
these
to
be
endless
in
number
and
variety
such
mechanical
inventions
as
were
needed
for
the
building
of
their
great
cathedrals
their
municipal
buildings
abbeys
castles
piers
bridges
and
the
like
were
admirably
worked
out
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention
and
whenever
needs
asserted
themselves
these
old
generations
responded
to
them
very
successfully
there
are
however
a
number
of
inventions
that
would
attract
attention
even
in
the
modern
time
for
their
practical
usefulness
and
ingenuity
with
the
growth
of
the
universities
writing
became
much
more
common
textbooks
were
needed
and
so
paper
was
invented
with
the
increase
of
reading
to
replace
teaching
by
hearing
spectacles
were
invented
time
became
more
precious
clocks
were
greatly
improved
and
we
hear
of
the
invention
of
something
like
an
alarm
clock
an
apparatus
which
after
a
fixed
number
of
hours
woke
the
monk
of
the
abbey
whose
duty
it
was
to
arouse
the
others
organs
for
churches
were
greatly
improved
bells
were
perfected
and
everything
else
in
connection
with
the
churches
so
well
fashioned
that
we
still
use
them
in
their
thirteenth
century
forms
gunpowder
was
not
invented
but
a
great
many
new
uses
were
found
for
it
and
roger
bacon
even
suggested
as
i
have
said
that
sometime
explosives
would
enable
boats
to
move
by
sea
without
sails
or
oars
or
carriages
to
move
on
land
without
horses
or
men
roger
bacon
even
suggested
the
possibility
of
airships
described
how
one
might
be
made
the
wings
of
which
would
be
worked
by
a
windlass
and
thought
that
he
could
make
it
his
friend
and
pupil
peregrinus
invented
the
double
pivoted
compass
and
as
the
first
faddist
described
how
he
would
set
about
making
a
magnetic
engine
that
he
thought
would
run
forever
when
we
recall
how
much
they
accomplished
mechanically
in
the
construction
of
buildings
it
becomes
evident
that
any
mechanical
problem
that
these
generations
wanted
solved
they
succeeded
in
solving
very
well
what
they
have
left
us
as
inventions
are
among
the
most
useful
appliances
that
we
have
without
paper
and
without
spectacles
the
intellectual
world
would
be
in
a
sad
case
indeed
many
of
the
secrets
of
their
inventions
in
the
arts
and
crafts
have
been
lost
and
in
spite
of
all
our
study
we
have
not
succeeded
in
rediscovering
them
xxiii
industry
and
trade
we
are
rather
inclined
to
think
that
large
organizations
of
industry
and
trade
were
reserved
for
comparatively
modern
times
to
think
so
however
is
to
forget
the
place
occupied
by
the
monasteries
and
convents
in
the
olden
time
we
have
heard
much
of
the
lazy
monks
but
only
from
those
who
know
nothing
at
all
about
them
idleness
in
the
monasteries
was
one
of
the
accusations
made
by
the
commission
set
to
furnish
evidence
to
henry
viii
on
which
he
might
suppress
the
monasteries
but
every
modern
historian
has
rejected
the
findings
of
that
commission
as
false
many
forms
of
manufacture
were
carried
on
in
the
monasteries
and
convents
they
were
the
principal
bookmakers
and
bookbinders
to
a
great
extent
they
were
the
manufacturers
of
art
fabrics
and
work
intended
for
church
use
but
also
for
the
decoration
of
luxurious
private
apartments
most
of
us
have
known
something
of
all
this
finer
work
but
not
that
they
had
much
to
do
with
cruder
industries
also
they
were
millers
and
shoemakers
for
themselves
and
their
tenantry
knitting
was
done
in
the
convents
and
all
the
finer
fancy
work
a
recent
meeting
of
the
institute
of
mining
engineers
in
england
brought
out
some
discussion
of
coal
mining
in
connection
with
the
early
history
of
the
coal
mines
in
england
the
records
of
many
of
the
english
monasteries
show
that
in
early
times
the
monks
knew
the
value
of
coal
and
used
it
rather
freely
they
also
mined
it
for
others
the
monks
at
tynemouth
are
known
to
have
been
mining
coal
on
the
manor
of
tynemouth
in
and
shipping
it
to
a
distance
at
durham
and
at
finchale
abbey
they
were
doing
this
also
about
the
same
time
it
would
require
special
study
to
bring
out
the
interesting
details
but
there
is
abundant
material
not
alone
for
a
chapter
but
for
a
volume
on
the
industries
of
the
thirteenth
century
which
like
the
education
and
the
literature
and
the
culture
of
the
time
we
have
thought
undeveloped
because
we
knew
nothing
of
them
the
relation
of
the
monasteries
to
trade
domestic
and
foreign
is
very
well
brought
out
in
a
paragraph
of
ralph
adams
cram
book
on
the
ruined
abbeys
of
great
britain
new
york
the
churchman
in
which
he
describes
the
remains
at
beaulieu
which
show
the
place
of
that
monastery
not
by
any
means
one
of
the
most
important
in
england
in
trade
for
the
benefit
of
their
tenantry
others
had
done
even
more
some
idea
of
the
power
of
one
of
these
great
monasteries
may
be
gained
from
traces
still
existing
of
the
center
of
trade
built
up
by
the
monks
outside
their
gates
here
at
the
head
of
tide
water
in
a
most
spot
a
great
stone
quay
was
constructed
to
which
came
ships
from
foreign
lands
near
by
was
a
great
marketplace
now
as
then
called
cheapside
though
commerce
exists
there
no
longer
at
the
height
of
monastic
glory
the
religious
houses
were
actually
the
chief
centers
of
industry
and
civilization
and
around
them
grew
up
the
eager
villages
many
of
which
now
exist
even
though
their
impulse
and
original
inspiration
have
long
since
departed
of
course
the
possessions
of
the
abbey
reached
far
away
from
the
walls
in
every
direction
including
many
farms
even
at
a
great
distance
for
the
abbeys
were
then
the
great
landowners
and
beneficent
landlords
they
were
as
well
even
in
their
last
days
for
we
have
many
records
of
the
cruelty
and
hardships
that
came
to
the
tenants
the
moment
the
stolen
lands
came
into
the
hands
of
laymen
xxiv
fairs
and
markets
a
chapter
might
well
have
been
devoted
to
showing
the
significance
of
those
curious
old
institutions
the
fairs
and
market
days
of
the
middle
ages
the
country
folk
flocked
into
town
bringing
with
them
their
produce
and
found
there
gathered
from
many
parts
merchants
come
to
exchange
and
barter
the
expense
of
maintaining
a
store
all
the
year
around
was
done
away
with
and
profits
did
not
have
to
be
large
exchanges
were
direct
and
the
profits
of
the
middlemen
were
to
a
great
extent
eliminated
it
was
distinctly
to
the
advantage
of
the
poor
for
the
expenses
of
commerce
were
limited
to
the
greatest
possible
extent
and
every
advantage
accrued
to
the
customer
besides
these
market
days
became
days
of
innocent
merriment
amusement
and
diversion
wandering
purveyors
of
amusement
followed
the
fairs
and
obtained
their
living
from
the
generosity
of
the
people
who
were
amused
these
amusements
were
conducted
out
of
doors
and
with
very
few
of
the
objectionable
features
as
regards
hygiene
and
morality
that
are
likely
to
attach
themselves
to
the
same
things
in
our
day
the
amusement
was
what
we
would
call
now
vaudeville
singing
dancing
the
exhibition
of
trained
animals
acrobatic
feats
of
various
kinds
so
that
we
can
not
very
well
say
that
our
people
are
in
advance
of
their
medieval
forbears
in
such
matters
since
their
taste
is
about
the
same
fairs
and
market
days
made
country
life
less
monotonous
by
their
regular
recurrence
and
so
prevented
that
emptying
of
the
country
into
the
city
which
we
deprecate
in
our
time
they
had
economic
social
even
moral
advantages
that
are
worth
while
studying
xxv
intensive
farming
we
hear
much
of
intensive
farming
in
the
modern
time
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
distinctly
modern
invention
mothered
by
the
necessity
due
to
great
increase
of
population
one
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
story
of
monasticism
in
the
countries
of
europe
however
during
the
middle
ages
and
especially
during
the
thirteenth
century
when
so
many
of
the
greatest
abbeys
reached
a
climax
of
power
and
influence
and
beauty
of
construction
is
their
successful
devotion
paid
to
agriculture
in
the
modern
time
we
are
gradually
learning
the
lesson
of
growing
larger
and
larger
crops
on
the
same
area
of
ground
by
proper
selection
of
seed
and
of
developing
cattle
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
them
most
valuable
as
a
of
farming
this
is
exactly
what
the
old
monastic
establishments
did
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
many
of
them
were
situated
in
rather
barren
regions
sometimes
indeed
surrounded
by
thick
forests
but
at
the
end
of
the
century
all
the
great
monastic
establishments
had
succeeded
in
making
beautiful
luxuriant
gardens
for
themselves
and
had
taught
their
numerous
tenantry
the
great
lessons

agricultural
improvement
which
made
for
plenty
and
happiness
many
monasteries
belonged
to
the
same
religious
order
and
the
traditions
of
these
were
carried
from
one
to
the
other
by
visiting
monks
or
sometimes
by
the
transfer
of
members
of
one
community
to
another
the
monastic
establishments
were
the
great
farmers
of
europe
and
it
was
their
proud
boast
that
their
farming
lands
instead
of
being
exhausted
from
year
to
year
were
rather
increasing
in
value
they
doubtless
had
many
secrets
of
farming
that
were
lost
and
had
to
be
rediscovered
in
the
modern
time
just
as
in
the
arts
and
crafts
for
their
success
in
farming
was
as
noteworthy
their
knowledge
of
trees
must
have
been
excellent
since
they
surrounded
themselves
with
fine
forests
at
times
arranged
so
as
to
provide
shady
walks
and
charming
avenues
their
knowledge
of
simple
farming
must
have
been
thorough
for
the
farms
of
the
monasteries
were
always
the
most
prosperous
and
the
tenantry
were
always
the
happiest
with
the
traditions
that
we
have
especially
in
english
history
this
seems
almost
impossible
to
credit
but
these
traditions
manufactured
for
a
purpose
have
now
been
entirely
discredited
we
have
learned
in
recent
years
what
wonderful
scholars
architects
painters
teachers
engineers
these
monks
were
and
so
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
they
had
magnificently
developed
agricultural
knowledge
as
well
as
that
of
every
other
department
in
which
they
were
particularly
interested

human
progress
for
most
people
the
impossible
would
apparently
be
accomplished
if
a
century
so
far
back
as
the
thirteenth
were
to
be
even
seriously
thought
of
as
the
greatest
of
centuries
evolution
has
come
to
be
accepted
so
unquestioningly
that
of
course
we
are
the
heirs
of
all
the
ages
of
the
foremost
files
of
time
and
must
be
far
ahead
of
our
forbears
especially
of
the
distant
past
in
everything
when
a
man
talks
glibly
about
great
progress
in
recent
times
he
usually
knows
only
the
history
of
his
own
time
and
not
very
much
about
that
men
who
have
studied
other
periods
seriously
hesitate
about
the
claim
of
progress
and
the
more
anyone
knows
about
any
other
period
the
less
does
he
think
of
his
own
as
surpassing
there
are
many
exemplifications
of
this
in
recent
literature
because
this
was
a
cardinal
point
in
many
criticisms
of
the
book
it
has
seemed
well
to
illustrate
the
position
here
taken
as
to
the
absence
of
progress
in
humanity
by
quotations
from
recognized
authorities
just
as
the
first
edition
of
this
book
came
from
the
press
ambassador
bryce
delivered
his
address
at
harvard
on
what
is
progress
it
appeared
in
the
for
august
bryce
is
evidently
not
at
all
persuaded
that
there
is
human
progress
in
any
real
sense
of
the
word
some
striking
quotations
may
be
made
from
the
address
but
to
get
the
full
impression
of
bryce
reasons
for
hesitation
about
accepting
any
progress
the
whole
article
needs
to
be
read
for
instance
he
said
it
does
not
seem
possible
if
we
go
back
to
the
earliest
literature
which
survives
to
us
from
western
asia
and
southeastern
europe
to
say
that
the
creative
powers
of
the
human
mind
in
such
subjects
as
poetry
philosophy
and
historical
narrative
or
portraiture
have
either
improved
or
deteriorated
the
poetry
of
the
early
hebrews
and
of
the
early
greeks
has
never
been
surpassed
and
hardly
ever
equaled
neither
has
the
philosophy
of
plato
and
aristotle
nor
the
speeches
of
demosthenes
and
cicero
geniuses
like
dante
chaucer
and
shakespeare
appear
without
our
being
able
to
account
for
them
and
for
aught
we
know
another
may
appear
at
any
moment
it
is
just
as
difficult
if
we
look
back
five
centuries
to
assert
either
progress
or
decline
in
painting
sculpture
has
never
again
risen
to
so
high
a
level
as
it
touched
in
the
fifth
century
b
c
nor
within
the
last
three
centuries
to
so
high
a
level
as
it
reached
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
but
we
can
found
no
generalizations
upon
that
fact
music
is
the
most
inscrutable
of
the
arts
and
whether
there
is
any
progress
to
be
expected
other
than
that
which
may
come
from
a
further
improvement
in
instruments
constituting
an
orchestra
i
will
not
attempt
to
conjecture
any
more
than
i
should
dare
to
raise
controversy
by
inquiring
whether
beethoven
represents
progress
from
mozart
wagner
progress
from
beethoven
perhaps
the
most
startling
evidence
on
this
subject
of
the
absence
of
evolution
in
humanity
is
the
opinion
of
flinders
petrie
the
distinguished
english
authority
on
egyptology
who
has
added
nearly
a
millennium
to
the
history
of
egypt
his
studies
have
brought
him
in
intimate
contact
with
egypt
from
to
he
has
found
no
reason
at
all
for
thinking
that
our
generation
is
farther
advanced
in
any
important
qualities
than
men
were
during
this
period
in
an
article
on
the
romance
of
early
civilization
he
said
we
have
now
before
us
a
view
of
the
powers
of
man
at
the
earliest
point
to
which
we
can
trace
written
history
and
what
strikes
us
most
is
how
very
little
his
nature
or
abilities
have
changed
in
seven
thousand
years
he
admired
we
admire
what
were
his
limits
in
fine
handiwork
also
are
we
may
have
a
wider
outlook
a
greater
understanding
of
things
our
interests
may
have
extended
in
this
interval
but
so
far
as
human
nature
and
tastes
go
man
is
essentially
unchanged
in
this
interval
this
is
the
practical
outcome
of
extending
our
view
of
man
three
times
as
far
back
as
we
used
to
look
and
it
must
teach
us
how
little
material
civilization
is
likely
in
the
future
to
change
the
nature
the
weaknesses
or
the
abilities
of
our
ancestors
in
ages
yet
to
come
those
who
think
that
man
has
advanced
in
practical
wisdom
during
the
years
of
history
forget
entirely
the
lessons
of
literature
whenever
a
great
genius
has
written
he
has
displayed
a
knowledge
of
human
nature
as
great
as
any
to
be
found
at
any
other
time
in
the
world
history
the
wisdom
of
homer
and
of
solomon
are
typical
examples
probably
the
most
striking
evidence
in
this
matter
is
to
be
found
in
what
is
considered
to
be
the
oldest
book
ever
written
this
is
the
instructions
of
ptah
hotep
to
his
son
ptah
hotep
was
the
vizier
of
king
itosi
of
the
fifth
dynasty
of
egypt
about
there
is
nothing
that
a
father
of
the
modern
time
would
wish
to
tell
his
boy
as
the
result
of
his
own
experience
that
is
not
to
be
found
in
this
wise
advice
of
a
father
nearly
years
ago
this
was
written
longer
before
solomon
than
solomon
is
before
us
yet
no
practical
knowledge
to
be
gained
from
intercourse
with
men
has
been
added
to
what
this
careful
father
of
the
long
ago
has
written
out
for
his
son
the
century
of
origins
to
many
readers
apparently
it
has
seemed
that
the
main
reason
for
writing
of
the
thirteenth
as
the
greatest
of
centuries
was
the
fact
that
the
church
occupied
so
large
a
place
in
the
life
of
that
time
and
that
therefore
most
of
what
was
accomplished
must
naturally
revert
to
her
account
it
is
not
only
those
who
are
interested
in
the
old
church
however
who
have
written
enthusiastically
about
the
thirteenth
century
since
writing
this
volume
i
have
found
that
frederick
harrison
is
almost
if
not
quite
as
ardent
in
his
praise
of
it
as
i
have
been
there
are
many
others
especially
among
the
historians
of
art
and
of
architecture
who
apparently
have
not
been
able
to
say
all
that
they
would
wish
in
admiration
of
this
supreme
century
most
of
these
have
not
been
catholics
and
if
we
place
beside
frederick
harrison
the
great
positivist
of
our
generation
john
morley
the
great
rationalist
the
chorus
of
agreement
on
the
subject
of
the
greatness
of
the
thirteenth
century
ought
to
be
considered
about
complete

his
address
on
popular

delivered

said
it
is
the
present
that
really
interests
us
it
is
the
present
that
we
seek
to
understand
and
to
explain
i
do
not
in
the
least
want
to
know
what
happened
in
the
past
except
as
it
enables
me
to
see
my
way
more
clearly
through
what
is
happening
i
want
to
know
what
men
thought
and
did
in
the
thirteenth
century
not
out
of
any
dilettante
or
idle
antiquarian
curiosity
but
because
the
thirteenth
century
is
at
the
root
of
what
men
think
and
do
in
the
nineteenth
education
many
even
of
the
most
benevolent
readers
of
the
book
have
been
quite
sure
that
it
exaggerated
the
significance
of
medieval
education
and
above
all
claimed
too
much
for
the
breadth
of
culture
given
by
the
early
universities
huxley
is
perhaps
the
last
man
of
recent
times
who
would
be
suspected
for
a
moment
of
exaggerating
the
import
of
medieval
education
in
his
inaugural
address
on
universities
actual
and
ideal
delivered
as
rector
of
aberdeen
university
after
discussing
the
subject
very
thoroughly
he
said
the
scholars
of
the
medieval
universities
seem
to
have
studied
grammar
logic
and
rhetoric
arithmetic
and
geometry
astronomy
theology
and
music
thus
their
work
however
imperfect
and
faulty
judged
by
modern
lights
it
may
have
been
brought
them
face
to
face
with
all
the
leading
aspects
of
the
mind
of
man
for
these
studies
did
really
contain
at
any
rate
in
embryo
sometimes
it
may
be
in
caricature
what
we
now
call
philosophy
mathematical
and
physical
science
and
art
i
doubt
if
the
curriculum
of
any
modern
university
shows
so
clear
and
generous
a
comprehension
of
what
is
meant
by
culture
as
this
old
trivium
and
quadrivium
italics
ours
the
results
of
this
system
of
education
may
be
judged
best
perhaps
from
dante
as
an
example
in
the
popes
and
science
fordham
university
press
a
chapter
is
devoted
to
dante
as
the
typical
university
man
of
the
time
above
all
in
his
knowledge
of
science
as
displayed
in
his
great
poem
no
poet
of
the
modern
time
has
turned
with
so
much
confidence
to
every
phase
of
science
for
his
figures
as
this
product
of
medieval
universities
anyone
who
thinks
that
the
study
of
science
is
recent
or
that
nature
study
was
delayed
till
our
day
need
only
read
dante
to
be
completely
undeceived
the
fact
that
the
scholars
and
the
professors
at
the
universities
were
almost
without
exception
believers
in
the
possibility
of
the
transmutation
of
metals
in
the
old
days
used
to
be
considered
by
many
educated
people
as
quite
sufficient
to
stamp
them
as
lacking
in
judgment
and
as
prone
to
believe
all
sorts
of
incredible
and
even
impossible
things
without
justification
such
supercilious
condemnation
of
the
point
of
view
of
the
medieval
scholars
in
this
matter
however
has
recently
received
a
very
serious
jolt
sometime
ago
sir
william
ramsey
the
greatest
of
living
english
chemists
announced
at
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
that
he
had
succeeded
in
changing
copper
into
lithium
this
created
a
sensation
at
the
time
but
represented
after
all
a
culmination
of
effort
in
this
direction
that
had
long
been
expected
more
recently
sir
william
has
reported
to
the
british
chemical
society
that
he
has
succeeded
in
obtaining
carbon
from
four
substances
not
containing
this
element
bismuth
acid
thorium
and
zirconium
an
american
professor
of
chemistry
has
declared
that
he
would
like
to
remove
all
traces
of
silver
from
a
quantity
of
lead
ore
and
then
after
allowing
it
to
stand
for
some
years
have
the
opportunity
to
it
since
he
is
confident
that
he
would
find
further
traces
of
silver
in
it
that
had
developed
in
the
meantime
he
is
sure
that
the
reason
why
these
two
metals
always
occur
together
as
do
copper
and
gold
is
that
they
are
products
of
a
developmental
process
the
precious
metals
being
a
step
farther
on
in
that
process
than
the
base
metals
it
would
seem
then
that
the
medieval
scholars
were
not
so
silly
as
they
used
to
appear
before
we
knew
enough
about
the
subject
to
judge
them
properly
only
their
supercilious
critics
were
silly
it
is
probably
with
regard
to
the
exact
sciences
that
most
even
educated
people
are
quite
sure
that
the
thirteenth
century
does
not
deserve
to
be
thought
of
as
representing
great
human
advance
for
them
the
middle
ages
were
drowsily
speculative
but
never
exact
in
thinking
of
course
such
people
know
nothing
of
the
intense
exactness
of
thought
of
thomas
or
albertus
magnus
or
duns
scotus
it
would
be
impossible
moreover
to
make
them
realize
from
the
writings
of
these
men
how
exact
human
thought
actually
was
in
the
thirteenth
century
though
the
more
that
modern
students
devote
themselves
to
scholastic
philosophy
the
more
surely
do
they
appreciate
and
admire
this
very
quality
in
the
medieval
philosophy
for
such
people
very
probably
the
only
evidence
that
would
have
made
quite
an
adequate
answer
to
their
objection
would
be
a
chapter
on
the
mathematics
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
might
very
easily
have
been
made
for
cantor
in
his
history
of
mathematics
vorlesungen
über
geschichte
der
mathematik
leipzig
devotes
nearly
pages
of
his
second
volume
to
the
mathematicians
of
the
thirteenth
century
two
of
whom
leonardo
of
pisa
and
jordanus
nemorarius
did
so
much
in
arithmetic
the
theory
of
numbers
algebra
and
geometry
as
to
make
a
revolution
in
mathematics
cantor
says
that
they
accomplished
so
much
that
their
contemporaries
and
successors
could
scarcely
follow
them
much
less
go
beyond
them
they
had
great
disciples
like
john
of
sacrobusco
probably
john
of
holywood
near
dublin
joannes
campanus
and
others
cantor
calls
attention
particularly
to
the
spread
of
arithmetical
knowledge
among
the
masses
which
is
a
tribute
to
the
century
for
it
was
a
characteristic
of
the
time
that
the
new
thoughts
and
discoveries
of
scholars
were
soon
made
practical
and
penetrated
very
widely
among
the
people
brewer
in
the
preface
to
roger
works
quotes
some
of
bacon
expressions
with
regard
to
the
value
of
mathematics
the
english
franciscan
said
for
without
mathematics
nothing
worth
knowing
in
philosophy
can
be
attained
and
again
for
he
who
knows
not
mathematics
can
not
know
any
other
science
what
is
more
he
can
not
discover
his
own
ignorance
or
find
its
proper
remedy
the
term
mathematics
as
used
by
bacon
had
a
much
wider
application
then
than
now
and
brewer
notes
that
the
thirteenth
century
scientist
included
therein
geometry
arithmetic
astronomy
and
music
with
regard
to
education
the
best
evidence
that
far
from
any
exaggeration
of
what
was
accomplished
in
the
thirteenth
century
there
has
been
a
very
conservative
estimate
of
it
made
in
the
book
may
be
gathered
from
the
legally
erected
standards
of
the
medical
schools
and
the
legal
status
of
the
medical
profession
in
the
appendix
of
the
popes
and
science
two
bulls
are
published
issued
by
pope
john
xxii
establishing
medical
schools
in
perugia
at
that
time
in
the
papal
states
and
in
cahors
the
birthplace
of
this
pope
these
bulls
were
really
the
formal
charters
of
the
medical
schools
they
require
three
years
of
preliminary
study
at
the
university
and
four
or
five
years
at
medicine
before
the
degree
of
doctor
may
be
granted
and
in
addition
emphasized
that
the
curricula
of
the
new
medical
schools
must
be
equal
to
those
of
paris
and
bologna
these
bulls
were
issued
in
the
early
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
show
the
height
to
which
the
standards
of
medical
education
had
been
raised
there
will
be
found
also
a
law
of
frederick
issued
requiring
for
all
physicians
who
wished
to
practice
in
the
two
sicilies
three
years
of
preliminary
study
four
years
at
the
medical
school
and
a
year
of
practice
with
a
physician
before
the
diploma
which
constituted
a
license
to
practice
would
be
issued
this
law
is
also
a
pure
drug
law
forbidding
the
sale
of
impure
drugs
under
penalty
of
confiscation
of
goods
and
the
preparation
of
them
under
penalty
of
death
our
pure
drug
law
was
passed
about
the
time
of
the
issue
of
the
first
edition
of
this
book
those
who
ask
for
the
results
of
this
training
may
find
them
in
the
story
of
guy
de
chauliac
the
father
of
modern
surgery
his
life
formed
the
basis
of
a
lecture
before
the
johns
hopkins
medical
club
that
is
to
be
published
in
the
bulletin
of
john
hopkins
hospital
it
is
incorporated
in
catholic
churchmen
in
science
second
series
the
dolphin
press
we
know
chauliac
work
not
by
tradition
but
from
his
great
on
surgery
this
great
papal
physician
of
the
fourteenth
century
operated
within
the
skull
did
not
hesitate
to
open
the
thorax
sewed
up
wounds
of
the
intestines
and
discussed
such
subjects
as
hernia
catheterization
the
treatment
of
fractures
and
manipulative
surgery
generally
with
wonderful
technical
ability
his
book
was
the
most
used
for
the
next
two
centuries
and
has
won
the
admiration
of
everyone
who
has
ever
read
it
technical
education
of
the
masses
some
of
my
friends
courteously
but
firmly
have
insisted
with
me
that
i
have
greatly
exaggerated
the
technical
abilities
of
the
village
workmen
of
the
middle
ages
that
every
town
of
less
than
ten
thousand
inhabitants
in
england
was
able
to
supply
such
workmen
as
we
can
scarcely
obtain
in
our
cities
of
a
million
inhabitants
and
in
that
scanty
population
supply
them
in
greater
numbers
than
we
can
now
secure
them
from
our
teeming
populations
seems
to
many
simply
impossible
what
i
have
been
trying
to
say
however
in
the
chapters
on
the
arts
and
crafts
and
on
popular
education
has
been
much
better
said
by
an
authority
that
will
scarcely
be
questioned
by
my
critics
the
rev
augustus
jessopp
who
has
been
for
twenty
years
the
rector
of
searning
in
england
who
is
an
honorary
fellow
of
john
college
and
of
worcester
college
oxford
besides
being
an
honorary
canon
in
the
cathedral
of
norwich
has
devoted
much
time
and
study
to
this
question
of
how
the
cathedrals
were
built
and
finished
twenty
years
of
his
life
have
been
spent
in
the
study
of
the
old
english
parish
and
of
parish
life
he
has
studied
the
old
parish
registers
and
talks
therefore
not
from
distant
impressions
but
from
the
actual
facts
as
they
are
recorded
if
to
his
position
as
an
antiquarian
authority
i
add
the
fact
that
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
roman
catholic
church
to
the
credit
of
which
so
much
of
this
popular
education
and
accomplishment
in
the
arts
and
crafts
of
the
century
accrues
the
value
of
his
evidence
is
placed
entirely
above
suspicion
of
partisan
partiality
in
his
chapter
on
parish
life
in
england
in
his
book
before
the
great
pillage
before
the
great
pillage
with
other
miscellanies
by
augustus
jessopp
london
fisher
unwin
paternoster
square
he
says
the
evidence
is
abundant
and
positive
and
is
increasing
upon
us
year
by
year
that
the
work
done
upon
the
fabrics
of
our
churches
and
the
other
work
done
in
the
beautifying
of
the
interior
of
our
churches
such
as
the
woodcarving
of
our
screens
the
painting
of
the
lovely
figures
in
the
panels
of
those
screens
the
embroidery
of
the
banners
and
vestments
the
frescoes
on
the
walls
the
engraving
of
the
monumental
brasses
the
stained
glass
in
the
windows
and
all
that
vast
aggregate
of
artistic
achievements
which
existed
in
immense
profusion
in
our
village
churches
till
the
sixteenth
century
stripped
them
bare
all
this
was
executed
by
local
craftsmen
the
evidence
for
this
is
accumulating
upon
us
every
year
as
one
antiquary
after
another
succeeds
in
unearthing
fragments
of
accounts
we
have
actual
contracts
for
church
building
and
church
repairing
undertaken
by
village
contractors
we
have
the
cost
of
a
rood
screen
paid
to
a
village
carpenter
of
painting
executed
by
local
artists
we
find
the
name
of
an
artificer
described
as
aurifaber
or
worker
in
gold
and
silver
living
in
a
parish
which
could
never
have
had
five
hundred
inhabitants
we
find
the
people
in
another
place
casting
a
new
bell
and
making
the
mould
for
it
themselves
we
find
the
blacksmith
of
another
place
forging
the
iron
work
for
the
church
door
or
we
get
a
payment
entered
for
the
carving
of
the
bench
ends
in
a
little
church
five
hundred
years
ago
which
bench
ends
are
to
be
seen
in
that
church
at
the
present
moment
and
we
get
fairly
bewildered
by
the
astonishing
wealth
of
skill
and
artistic
taste
and
aesthetic
feeling
which
there
must
have
been
in
this
england
of
ours
in
times
which
till
lately
we
had
assumed
to
be
barbaric
times
bewildered
i
say
because
we
can
not
understand
how
it
all
came
to
a
in
a
single
generation
not
knowing
that
the
frightful
spoliation
of
our
churches
and
other
parish
buildings
and
the
outrageous
plunder
of
the
parish
gilds
in
the
reign
of
edward
the
sixth
by
the
horrible
band
of
robbers
that
carried
on
their
detestable
work
effected
such
a
hideous
obliteration
such
a
clean
sweep
of
the
precious
treasures
that
were
dispersed
in
rich
profusion
over
the
whole
land
that
a
dull
despair
of
ever
replacing
what
had
been
ruthlessly
pillaged
crushed
the
spirit
of
the
whole
nation
and
art
died
out
in
rural
england
and
king
whitewash
and
queen
ugliness
ruled
supreme
for
centuries
my
argument
is
that
a
century
which
produced
such
everywhere
had
technical
schools
in
great
profusion
though
they
may
not
have
been
called
by
any
such
ambitious
name
how
it
all
stopped
to
most
people
it
seems
impossible
to
understand
how
it
is
that
if
artistic
evolution
proceeded
to
the
perfection
which
it
now
seems
clear
that
it
actually
attained
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
we
are
only
just
getting
back
to
a
proper
state
of
public
taste
and
a
right
degree
of
artistic
skill
in
many
of
these
same
accomplishments
at
the
present
time
that
thought
has
come
to
many
others
who
knowing
and
appreciating
medieval
progress
in
art
and
literature
have
tried
to
work
out
the
reasons
for
the
gap
that
exists
between
medieval
art
and
modern
artistic
endeavor
some
of
these
explanations
because
they
serve
to
make
clear
why
art
evolution
stopped
so
abruptly
and
we
are
retracing
our
steps
and
taking
models
from
the
past
rather
than
doing
original
work
that
is
an
advance
must
be
quoted
here
many
people
will
find
in
them
i
think
the
reasons
for
their
misunderstanding
of
the
old
times
gerhardt
hauptmann
who
is
very
well
known
even
among
people
as
one
of
the
great
living
german
dramatists
and
whose
sunken
bell
attracted
considerable
attention
in
both
its
german
and
english
versions
here
in
new
york
in
a
recent
criticism
of
a
new
german
book
declared
that
the
reason
for
the
gap
between
modern
and
medieval
art
was
the
movement
now
coming
to
be
known
as
the
religious
revolt
in
germany
in
the
sixteenth
century
he
said
i
as
a
protestant
have
often
had
to
regret
that
we
purchased
our
freedom
of
conscience
our
individual
liberty
at
entirely
too
high
a
price
in
order
to
make
room
for
a
small
mean
little
plant
of
personal
life
we
destroyed
a
whole
garden
of
fancy
and
hewed
down
a
virgin
forest
of
aesthetic
ideas
we
went
even
so
far
in
the
insanity
of
our
weakness
as
to
throw
out
of
the
garden
of
our
souls
the
fruitful
soil
that
had
been
accumulating
for
thousands
of
years
or
else
we
plowed
it
under
sterile
clay
we
have
then
an
intellectual
culture
that
is
well
protected
by
a
hedge
of
our
personality
but
within
this
hedge
we
have
only
delicate
dwarf
trees
and
unworthy
plants
the
poorer
progeny
of
great
predecessors
we
have
telegraph
lines
bridges
and
railroads
but
there
grow
no
churches
and
cathedrals
only
sentry
boxes
and
barracks
we
need
gardeners
who
will
cause
the
present
sterilizing
process
of
the
soil
to
stop
and
will
enrich
the
surface
by
working
up
into
it
the
rich
layers
beneath
in
my
there
is
ever
before
me
the
photograph
of
sebaldus
tomb
model
metropolitan
museum
new
york
this
rich
german
symbol
rose
from
the
invisible
in
the
most
luxuriant
developmental
period
of
german
art
as
a
formal
product
of
that
art
it
is
very
difficult
to
appreciate
it
as
it
deserves
it
seems
to
me
as
one
of
the
most
wonderful
bits
of
work
in
the
whole
field
of
artistic
accomplishment
the
soul
of
all
the
great
medieval
period
encircles
this
silver
coffin
wrapping
it
up
into
a
noble
unity
and
enthrones
on
the
very
summit
of
death
life
as
a
growing
child
such
a
work
could
only
have
come
to
its
perfection
in
the
protected
spaces
of
the
old
mother
church
rev
jessopp
in
his
book
already
cited
the
great
pillage
does
not
hesitate
to
state
in
unmistakable
terms
the
reason
why
all
the
beauty
and
happiness
went
out
of
english
country
life
some
two
centuries
after
the
thirteenth
century
and
how
it
came
about
that
the
modern
generations
have
had
to
begin
over
again
from
the
beginning
and
not
where
our
catholic
forefathers
of
the
medieval
period
left
us
in
what
used
to
be
the
despised
middle
ages
he
says
when
i
talk
of
the
great
pillage
i
mean
that
horrible
and
outrageous
looting
of
our
churches
other
than
conventual
and
the
robbing
of
the
people
of
this
country
of
property
in
land
and
movables
which
property
had
actually
been
inherited
by
them
as
members
of
those
organized
religious
communities
known
as
parishes
it
is
necessary
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
in
the
general
scramble
of
the
terror
under
henry
the
eighth
and
of
the
anarchy
in
the
days
of
edward
the
sixth
there
was
only
one
class
that
was
permitted
to
retain
any
large
portion
of
its
endowments
the
monasteries
were
plundered
even
to
their
very
pots
and
pans
almshouses
in
which
old
men
and
women
were
fed
and
clothed
were
robbed
to
the
last
pound
the
poor
being
turned
out
into
the
cold
at
an
warning
to
beg
their
bread
hospitals
for
the
sick
and
needy
sometimes
magnificently
provided
with
nurses
and
chaplains
whose
very
raison
was
that
they
were
to
look
after
and
care
for
those
who
were
past
caring
for
themselves
these
were
stripped
of
all
their
belongings
the
inmates
sent
out
to
hobble
into
some
convenient
dry
ditch
to
lie
down
and
die
in
or
to
crawl
into
some
barn
or
hovel
there
to
be
tended
not
without
fear
of
consequences
by
some
kindly
man
or
woman
who
could
not
bear
to
see
a
suffering
fellow
creature
drop
down
and
die
at
their
own
doorposts
we
talk
with
a
great
deal
of
indignation
of
the
tweed
ring
the
day
will
come
when
someone
will
write
the
story
of
two
other
rings
the
ring
of
the
miscreants
who
robbed
the
monasteries
in
the
reign
of
henry
the
eighth
was
the
first
but
the
ring
of
the
robbers
who
robbed
the
poor
and
helpless
in
the
reign
of
edward
the
sixth
was
ten
times
worse
than
the
first
the
universities
only
just
escaped
the
general
confiscation
the
friendly
societies
and
benefit
clubs
and
the
gilds
did
not
escape
the
accumulated
wealth
of
centuries
their
houses
and
lands
their
money
their
vessels
of
silver
and
their
vessels
of
gold
their
ancient
cups
and
goblets
and
salvers
even
to
their
very
chairs
and
tables
were
all
set
down
in
inventories
and
catalogues
and
all
swept
into
the
great
robbers
hoard
last
but
not
least
the
immense
treasures
in
the
churches
the
joy
and
boast
of
every
man
and
woman
and
child
in
england
who
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
assembled
to
worship
in
the
old
houses
of
god
which
they
and
their
fathers
had
built
and
whose
every
vestment
and
chalice
and
candlestick
and
banner
organs
and
bells
and
picture
and
image
and
altar
and
shrine
they
looked
upon
as
their
own
and
part
of
their
birthright
all
these
were
torn
away
by
the
rudest
spoilers
carted
off
they
knew
not
whither
with
jeers
and
scoffs
and
ribald
shoutings
while
none
dared
raise
a
hand
or
let
his
voice
be
heard
above
the
whisper
of
a
prayer
of
bitter
grief
and
agony
one
class
was
spared
the
clergy
of
this
church
of
england
of
ours
managed
to
retain
some
of
their
endowments
but
if
the
boy
king
had
lived
another
three
years
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
these
too
would
have
gone
graft
prevailed
and
the
old
order
disappeared
in
a
slough
of
selfishness
comfort
and
poverty
a
number
of
friendly
critics
have
insisted
that
the
thirteenth
century
was
far
behind
later
times
in
the
comfort
of
the
people
poverty
is
supposed
to
have
been
almost
universal
doubtless
many
of
the
people
were
then
very
poor
personally
i
doubt
if
there
was
as
much
poverty
that
is
misery
due
to
actual
want
of
necessaries
of
life
as
there
is
at
the
present
time
certainly
it
was
not
emphasized
by
having
close
to
it
constantly
rendering
the
pains
of
poverty
poignant
by
contrast
the
luxury
of
the
modern
time
they
had
not
the
large
city
and
people
in
the
country
do
not
suffer
as
much
as
people
in
the
city
in
recent
years
investigations
of
poverty
in
england
have
been
appalling
in
the
statistics
that
they
have
presented
robert
hunter
in
his
book
poverty
has
furnished
us
with
some
details
that
make
one
feel
that
our
generation
should
be
the
last
to
say
that
the
thirteenth
century
was
behind
in
progress
because
so
many
of
the
people
were
so
poor
ruskin
once
said
that
the
ideal
of
the
great
nation
is
one
wherein
there
must
be
as
many
as
possible
and
human
creatures
i
am
sure
that
tried
by
this
standard
the
thirteenth
century
in
merrie
england
is
ahead
of
any
other
generation
and
above
all
far
in
advance
of
our
recent
generations
by
contrast
to
what
we
know
of
the
merrie
english
men
and
women
of
the
thirteenth
century
i
would
quote
hunter
paragraphs
on
the
poverty
of
the
modern
english
people
he
says
a
few
years
ago
england
did
not
know
the
extent
of
her
own
poverty
economists
and
writers
gave
opinions
of
all
kinds
some
said
conditions
were
others
said
such
statements
were
misleading
and
here
they
were
tilting
at
each
other
backward
and
forward
in
the
most
ponderous
and
serious
way
until
booth
a
business
man
undertook
to
get
at
the
facts
one
even
the
most
radical
economist
would
have
dared
to
have
estimated
the
poverty
of
london
as
extending
to
per
cent
of
the
as
it
proved
the
extent
of
poverty
the
number
of
underfed
underclothed
in
insanitary
houses
was
greater
than
could
reasonably
have
been
estimated
some
of
the
details
of
this
investigation
by
booth
were
so
startling
that
some
explanation
had
to
be
found
they
could
not
deny
in
the
face
of
booth
facts
but
they
set
up
the
claim
that
the
conditions
in
london
were
exceptional
then
rountree
made
an
investigation
in
york
with
precisely
the
same
results
more
than
one
in
four
of
the
population
was
in
poverty
to
quote
hunter
once
more
as
has
been
said
it
was
not
until
charles
booth
published
in
the
results
of
his
exhaustive
inquiries
that
the
actual
conditions
of
poverty
in
london
became
known
about
people
or
about
thirty
per
cent
of
the
entire
population
of
london
were
found
to
be
unable
to
obtain
the
necessaries
for
a
sound
livelihood
they
were
in
a
state
of
poverty
living
in
conditions
if
not
of
actual
misery
at
any
rate
bordering
upon
it
in
many
districts
considerably
more
than
half
of
the
population
were
either
in
distress
or
on
the
verge
of
distress
when
these
results
were
made
public
the
more
conservative
economists
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
the
conditions
in
london
were
of
course
exceptional
and
that
it
would
be
unsafe
to
make
any
generalizations
for
the
whole
of
england
on
the
basis
of
booth
figures
for
london
about
ten
years
later
rountree
incited
by
the
work
of
booth
undertook
a
similar
inquiry
in
his
native
town
york
a
small
provincial
city
in
most
ways
typical
of
the
smaller
towns
of
england
in
a
large
volume
in
which
the
results
are
published
it
is
shown
that
the
poverty
in
york
was
only
slightly
less
extensive
than
that
of
london
in
the
summary
rountree
compares
the
conditions
of
london
with
those
of
york
his
comments
are
as
follows
proportions
arrived
at
for
the
total
populations
living
in
poverty
in
london
and
york
respectively
were
as
under
london
per
cent
york
per
cent
the
proportion
of
the
population
living
in
poverty
in
york
may
be
regarded
as
practically
the
same
as
in
london
especially
when
we
remember
that
booth
information
was
gathered
in
a
period
of
only
average
trade
prosperity
whilst
the
york
figures
were
collected
in
when
trade
was
unusually
prosperous
he
continues
we
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
the
poverty
in
london
as
exceptional
but
when
the
result
of
careful
investigation
shows
that
the
proportion
of
poverty
in
london
is
practically
equalled
in
what
may
be
regarded
as
a
typical
provincial
town
we
are
faced
by
the
startling
probability
that
from
to
per
cent
of
the
town
populations
of
the
united
kingdom
are
living
in
poverty
most
of
us
will
be
inclined
to
think
that
rountree
must
exaggerate
and
what
he
calls
poverty
most
of
us
would
doubtless
be
inclined
to
think
a
modest
competency
a
little
below
respectability
he
fixed
the
standard
of
shillings
eight
pence
a
week
as
a
necessary
one
for
a
family
of
ordinary
size
he
says
a
family
living
upon
the
scale
allowed
for
in
this
estimate
must
never
spend
a
penny
on
railway
fare
or
omnibus
they
must
never
go
into
the
country
unless
they
walk
they
must
never
purchase
a
newspaper
or
spend
a
penny
to
buy
a
ticket
for
a
popular
concert
they
must
write
no
letters
to
absent
children
for
they
can
not
afford
to
pay
the
postage
they
must
never
contribute
anything
to
their
church
or
chapel
nor
give
any
help
to
a
neighbor
which
costs
them
money
they
can
not
save
nor
can
they
join
sick
club
or
trade
union
because
they
can
not
pay
the
necessary
subscription
the
children
must
have
no
pocket
money
for
dolls
marbles
or
sweets
the
father
must
smoke
no
tobacco
nor
drink
no
beer
the
mother
must
never
buy
any
pretty
clothes
for
herself
or
for
her
children
the
character
for
the
family
wardrobe
as
for
the
family
diet
being
governed
by
the
regulation
must
be
bought
but
that
which
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
physical
health
and
that
which
is
bought
must
be
of
the
plainest
and
most
economical
description
should
a
child
fall
ill
it
must
be
attended
by
the
family
parish
doctor
should
it
die
it
must
be
buried
by
the
parish
finally
the
must
never
be
absent
from
his
work
for
a
single
day
than
one
in
four
of
the
population
living
below
this
scale
conditions
are
if
anything
worse
on
the
continent
in
germany
industry
is
at
the
best
conditions
in
berlin
have
been
recently
reported
in
the
daily
consular
reports
by
a
government
official
of
the
somewhat
more
than
two
millions
of
people
who
live
in
berlin
have
an
income
nearly
of
the
incomes
however
are
exempt
from
taxation
because
they
do
not
amount
to
the
minimum
taxable
income
though
that
is
only
per
week
of
the
who
have
taxable
incomes
nearly
have
less
than
a
year
that
is
get
about
a
day
or
less
less
than
sixty
thousand
out
of
the
total
population
get
more
than
a
day
it
is
easy
to
say
but
hard
to
understand
that
this
is
a
living
wage
because
things
are
cheaper
in
germany
meat
is
however
nearly
twice
as
dear
sugar
is
twice
as
dear
bread
is
dearer
than
it
is
in
this
country
coffee
is
dearer
and
only
rent
is
somewhat
cheaper
it
is
easy
to
talk
about
the
spread
of
comfort
among
the
people
of
our
generation
and
the
raising
of
the
standard
of
living
but
if
one
compares
these
wages
with
the
price
of
things
as
they
are
now
it
is
hard
to
understand
on
just
what
basis
of
fact
the
claim
for
betterment
in
our
time
meaning
more
general
comfort
and
happiness
is
made
people
always
refuse
to
believe
that
conditions
are
as
bad
as
they
really
are
in
these
matters
americans
will
at
once
have
the
feeling
on
reading
hunter
and
rountree
words
and
the
account
of
the
american
consul
at
berlin
that
this
may
be
true
for
england
and
germany
but
that
of
course
it
is
very
different
here
in
america
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
it
is
very
different
here
in
america
in
this
matter
hunter
opinion
deserves
weight
he
has
for
years
devoted
himself
to
gathering
information
with
regard
to
this
subject
he
seems
to
be
sure
that
one
in
seven
of
our
population
is
in
poverty
probably
the
number
is
higher
than
this
here
is
his
opinion
how
many
people
in
the
country
are
in
poverty
is
the
number
yearly
growing
larger
are
there
each
year
more
and
more
of
the
unskilled
classes
pursuing
hopelessly
the
elusive
phantom
of
and
independence
are
they
as
in
a
dream
working
faster
only
the
more
swiftly
to
move
backward
are
there
each
year
more
and
more
hungry
children
and
more
and
more
fathers
whose
utmost
effort
may
not
bring
into
the
home
as
much
energy
in
food
as
it
takes
out
in
industry
these
are
not
fanciful
questions
nor
are
they
sentimental
ones
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
there
are
in
the
united
states
ten
million
persons
in
precisely
these
conditions
of
poverty
but
i
am
largely
guessing
and
there
may
be
as
many
as
fifteen
or
twenty
millions
perhaps
hunter
exaggerates
as
a
physician
i
should
be
inclined
to
think
not
but
certainly
his
words
and
above
all
the
english
statistics
will
give
any
one
pause
who
is
sure
on
general
principles
that
the
great
mass
of
the
people
are
happier
now
or
more
comfortable
above
all
in
mind
the
only
real
happiness
than
they
were
in
the
thirteenth
century
after
due
consideration
of
this
kind
no
one
will
insist
on
the
comparative
misery
and
suffering
of
the
poor
in
old
times
england
had
less
than
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
probably
there
was
never
a
time
in
her
history
when
a
greater
majority
of
her
people
fulfilled
ruskin
and
morris
ideals
of
human
beings
the
worker
got
at
least
what
the
worker
in
carlyle
words
has
always
obtained
due
food
and
lodging
england
was
not
a
nation
with
sleek
english
horses
and
hungry
dissatisfied
englishmen
comfort
and
happiness
there
is
another
side
to
the
question
of
comparative
happiness
that
may
be
stated
in
the
words
of
william
morris
when
he
says
in
hopes
and
fears
for
art
that
a
greek
or
a
roman
of
the
luxurious
time
and
of
course
a
medieval
of
the
thirteenth
century
would
stare
astonished
could
he
be
brought
back
again
and
shown
the
comforts
of
a
house
this
expression
is
often
and
one
is
prone
to
wonder
how
many
of
those
who
use
it
realize
that
it
is
a
quotation
and
above
all
appreciate
the
fact
that
morris
made
the
statement
in
order
to
rebut
it
his
answer
is
in
certain
ways
so
complete
that
it
deserves
to
be
quoted
when
you
hear
of
the
luxuries
of
the
ancients
you
must
remember
that
they
were
not
like
our
luxuries
they
were
rather
indulgence
in
pieces
of
extravagant
folly
than
what
we
call
luxury
which
perhaps
you
would
rather
call
comfort
well
i
accept
the
word
and
say
that
a
greek
or
a
roman
of
the
luxurious
time
would
stare
astonished
could
he
be
brought
back
again
and
shown
the
comforts
of
a
house
but
some
i
know
think
that
the
attainment
of
these
very
comforts
is
what
makes
the
difference
between
civilization
and
uncivilization
that
they
are
the
essence
of
civilization
is
it
so
indeed
farewell
my
hope
then
i
had
thought
that
civilization
meant
the
attainment
of
peace
and
order
and
freedom
of
between
man
and
man
of
the
love
of
truth
and
the
hatred
of
injustice
and
by
consequence
the
attainment
of
the
good
life
which
these
things
breed
a
life
free
from
craven
fear
but
full
of
incident
that
was
what
i
thought
it
meant
not
more
stuffed
chairs
and
more
cushions
and
more
carpets
and
gas
and
more
dainty
meat
and
drink
and
therewithal
more
and
sharper
differences
between
class
and
class
if
that
be
what
it
is
i
for
my
part
wish
i
were
well
out
of
it
and
living
in
a
tent
in
the
persian
desert
or
a
turf
hut
on
the
iceland
hillside
but
however
it
be
and
i
think
my
view
is
the
true
view
i
tell
you
that
art
abhors
that
side
of
civilization
she
can
not
breath
in
the
houses
that
lie
under
its
stuffy
slavery
believe
me
if
we
want
art
to
begin
at
home
as
it
must
we
must
clear
our
houses
of
troublesome
superfluities
that
are
forever
in
our
way
conventional
comforts
that
are
no
real
comforts
and
do
but
make
work
for
servants
and
doctors
if
you
want
a
golden
rule
that
will
fit
everybody
this
is
it
nothing
in
your
houses
that
you
do
not
know
to
be
useful
or
believe
to
be
beautiful
comfort
and
health
a
comment
on
william
morris
significant
paragraphs
may
be
summed
up
in
some
reflections
on
the
scornful
expression
of
a
friend
who
asked
how
is
it
possible
to
talk
of
happiness
at
a
time
when
there
were
no
glass
in
windows
and
no
heating
apparatus
except
the
open
fireplace
in
the
great
hall
of
the
larger
houses
or
in
the
kitchen
of
the
dwelling
houses
to
this
there
is
the
ready
answer
that
in
the
modern
time
we
have
gone
so
far
to
the
opposite
extreme
as
to
work
serious
harm
to
health
when
a
city
dweller
develops
tuberculosis
his
physician
now
sends
him
out
to
the
mountains
asks
him
to
sleep
with
his
window
wide
open
and
requires
him
to
spend
just
as
much
of
his
time
as
possible
in
the
open
air
even
with
the
temperature
below
zero
in
our
hospitals
the
fad
for
making
patients
comfortable
by
artificial
heat
is
passing
and
that
of
stimulating
them
by
cold
fresh
air
is
gaining
ground
we
know
that
for
all
the
fevers
and
all
the
respiratory
diseases
this
brings
about
a
notable
reduction
in
the
mortality
surely
what
is
good
for
the
ailing
must
be
even
better
to
keep
them
well
from
disease
many
a
physician
now
arranges
to
sleep
out
of
doors
all
winter
certainly
all
the
respiratory
diseases
are
rendered
much
more
fatal
and
modern
liability
to
them
greatly
increased
by
our
houses
the
medieval
people
were
less
comfortable
from
a
sensual
standpoint
but
the
healthy
glow
and
reaction
after
cold
probably
made
them
enjoy
life
better
than
we
do
in
our
houses
they
secured
bodily
warmth
by
an
active
circulation
of
their
blood
we
secure
it
by
the
circulation
of
hot
water
or
steam
in
our
houses
ours
may
be
the
better
way
but
the
question
is
not
yet
absolutely
decided
a
physician
friend
points
to
the
great
reduction
in
the
in
modern
times
and
insists
that
this
of
course
means
definite
progress
even
this
is
not
quite
so
sure
as
is
often
thought
we
are
saving
a
great
many
lives
that
heretofore
in
the
course
of
nature
under
conditions
requiring
a
more
vigorous
life
passed
out
of
existence
early
it
is
doubtful
however
whether
this
is
an
advantage
for
the
race
since
our
insane
asylums
our
hospitals
for
incurables
and
our
homes
of
various
kinds
now
have
inmates
in
much
greater
proportion
to
the
population
than
ever
before
in
history
these
are
mainly
individuals
of
lower
resistive
vitality
who
would
have
been
allowed
to
get
out
of
existence
early
save
themselves
and
their
friends
from
useless
suffering
and
whose
presence
in
life
does
not
add
greatly
if
at
all
to
the
possibilities
of
human
accomplishment
our
reduced
is
because
of
comfort
seeking
more
than
counterbalanced
by
a
reduced
so
that
no
advantage
is
reaped
for
the
race
in
the
end
these
reflections
of
course
are
only
meant
to
suggest
how
important
it
is
to
view
such
questions
from
all
sides
before
being
sure
that
they
represent
definite
progress
for
humanity
progress
is
much
more
elusive
than
is
ordinarily
thought
and
is
never
the
simple
unmistakable
movement
of
advance
it
is
often
thought
hygiene
the
objection
that
medical
friends
have
had
to
the
claims
of
the
thirteenth
as
the
greatest
of
centuries
is
that
it
failed
to
pay
any
attention
to
hygiene
here
once
more
we
have
a
presumption
that
is
not
founded
on
real
knowledge
of
the
time
it
is
rather
easy
to
show
that
these
generations
were
anticipating
many
of
our
solutions
of
hygienic
problems
quite
as
well
as
our
solutions
of
other
social
and
intellectual
difficulties
in
the
sketch
of
pope
john
the
physician
who
became
pope
during
the
second
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
which
was
published
in
ophthalmology
a
quarterly
review
of
eye
diseases
because
pope
john
wrote
a
little
book
on
this
subject
which
has
many
valuable
anticipations
of
modern
knowledge
i
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
while
a
physician
and
professor
of
medicine
at
the
medical
school
of
the
university
of
sienna
this
pope
then
known
as
peter
of
spain
had
made
some
contributions
to
sanitary
science
later
he
was
appointed
archiater
that
is
physician
in
charge
of
the
city
of
rome
as
pointed
out
in
the
sketch
of
him
as
enlarged
for
the
volume
containing
a
second
series
of
catholic
churchmen
in
science
the
dolphin
press
he
seems
to
have
been
particularly
interested
in
popular
health
for
we
have
a
little
book
thesaurus
pauperum
the
treasure
of
the
poor
which
contains
many
directions
for
the
maintenance
of
health
and
the
treatment
of
disease
by
those
who
are
too
poor
to
secure
physicians
advice
the
fact
that
the
head
of
the
bureau
of
health
in
rome
should
have
been
made
pope
in
the
thirteenth
century
itself
speaks
volumes
for
the
awakening
of
the
educated
classes
at
least
to
the
value
of
hygiene
and
sanitation
their
attention
to
hygiene
can
be
best
shown
by
a
consideration
of
the
hospitals
ordinarily
it
is
assumed
that
the
hospitals
provided
a
roof
for
the
sick
and
the
injured
but
scarcely
more
most
physicians
will
probably
be
quite
sure
that
they
were
rather
of
disease
than
real
blessings
to
the
ailing
that
is
not
what
we
find
when
we
study
them
carefully
these
generations
gave
us
a
precious
lesson
by
eradicating
leprosy
which
was
quite
as
general
as
tuberculosis
is
now
and
they
made
special
hospitals
for
erysipelas
which
materially
lessened
the
diffusion
of
that
disease
in
rewriting
the
chapter
on
the
foundation
of
city
hospitals
for
my
book
the
popes
and
science
fordham
university
press
i
incorporated
into
it
a
description
of
the
hospital
erected
at
tanierre
in
france
in
by
marguerite
of
bourgogne
the
sister
of
louis
of
this
hospital
arthur
dillon
from
the
standpoint
of
the
modern
architect
says
it
was
an
admirable
hospital
in
every
way
and
it
is
doubtful
if
we
surpass
it
it
was
isolated
the
ward
was
separated
from
the
other
buildings
it
had
the
advantage
we
often
lose
of
being
but
one
story
high
and
more
space
was
given
to
each
patient
than
we
now
afford
the
ventilation
by
the
great
windows
and
ventilators
in
the
ceiling
was
excellent
it
was
cheerfully
lighted
and
the
arrangement
of
the
gallery
shielded
the
patients
from
dazzling
light
and
from
draughts
from
the
windows
and
afforded
an
easy
means
of
supervision
while
the
division
by
the
roofless
low
partitions
isolated
the
sick
and
obviated
the
depression
that
comes
from
the
sight
of
others
in
pain
it
was
moreover
in
great
contrast
to
the
cheerless
white
wards
of
the
vaulted
ceiling
was
very
beautiful
the
woodwork
was
richly
carved
and
the
great
windows
over
the
altars
were
filled
with
colored
glass
altogether
it
was
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
best
period
of
gothic
architecture
in
their
individual
hygiene
there
was
of
course
much
to
be
desired
among
the
people
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
it
has
been
declared
that
the
history
of
europe
from
the
fifth
to
the
fifteenth
century
might
from
the
hygienic
standpoint
he
summed
up
as
a
thousand
years
without
a
bath
the
more
we
know
about
this
period
however
the
less
of
point
do
we
find
in
the
epigram
cram
in
the
ruined
abbeys
of
great
britain
pott
has
described
wonderful
arrangements
within
the
monasteries
for
the
conduction
of
water
from
long
distances
for
all
toilet
purposes
there
was
much
more
attention
to
sanitary
details
than
we
have
been
prone
to
think
cram
in
describing
what
was
by
no
means
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
english
abbeys
of
the
thirteenth
century
says
here
at
beaulieu
the
water
was
brought
by
an
underground
conduit
from
an
unfailing
spring
a
mile
away
and
this
served
for
drinking
washing
and
bathing
the
supply
of
the
fish
ponds
and
for
a
constant
flushing
of
the
elaborate
system
of
drainage
in
sanitary
matters
the
monks
were
as
far
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
society
as
they
were
in
learning
and
agriculture
wages
and
the
condition
op
working
people
what
every
reader
of
the
thirteenth
century
seems
to
be
perfectly
sure
of
is
that
whatever
else
there
may
have
been
in
this
precious
time
at
least
the
workmen
were
not
well
paid
and
men
worked
practically
for
nothing
it
is
confessed
that
of
course
working
as
they
did
on
their
cathedrals
they
had
a
right
to
work
for
very
little
if
they
wished
but
at
least
there
has
been
a
decided
step
upward
in
evolution
in
the
gradual
raising
of
wages
until
at
last
the
workman
is
beginning
to
be
paid
some
adequate
compensation
there
is
probably
no
phase
of
the
life
of
the
middle
ages
with
regard
to
which
people
are
more
mistaken
than
this
supposition
that
the
workmen
of
this
early
time
were
paid
inadequately
i
have
already
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
workmen
of
this
period
claimed
and
obtained
the
three
eights
eight
hours
of
work
eight
hours
of
sleep
and
eight
hours
for
recreation
and
bodily
necessities
they
obtained
the
saturday
and
also
release
from
work
on
the
vigils
of
all
feast
days
and
there
were
nearly
forty
of
these
in
the
year
after
the
vesper
hour
that
is
three
in
summer
and
two
in
winter
there
was
no
work
on
the
eves
of
of
obligation
with
regard
to
wages
there
is
just
one
way
to
get
at
the
subject
and
that
is
to
present
the
legal
table
of
wages
enacted
by
parliament
placing
beside
it
the
legal
maximum
price
of
necessities
of
life
as
also
determined
by
parliamentary
enactment
an
act
of
edward
iii
fixes
the
wages
without
food
as
follows
there
are
many
other
things
mentioned
but
the
following
will
be
enough
for
our
purpose
price
in
shillings
and
pence
a
woman
or
weeding

the

a

filling
a
reaper

the
price
of

and

that

continued
in

was

of

fourteenth
century
in
fixing

four
sorts
of
meat
beef
pork
mutton
and
veal
and
sets
forth
in
its
preamble
the
words
these
being
the
food
of
the
poorer
sort
the
poor
in
england
do
not
eat
these
kinds
of
meat
now
and
the
investigators
of
the
poverty
of
the
country
declare
that
most
of
the
poor
live
almost
exclusively
on
bread
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
large
city
populations
are
likely
to
harbor
many
very
miserable
people
while
the
rural
population
of
england
in
the
middle
ages
containing
the
bulk
of
the
people
were
and
merry
when
we
recall
this
in
connection
with
what
i
have
given
in
the
text
with
regard
to
the
and
their
care
for
the
people
the
foolish
notion
founded
on
a
mere
assumption
and
due
to
that
aristophanic
joke
our
complacent
which
makes
us
so
ready
to
believe
that
our
generation
be
better
off
than
others
were
vanishes
completely
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
beef
pork
mutton
veal
and
even
poultry
were
the
food
of
the
poor
when
a
workman
could
earn
the
price
of
a
sheep
in
less
than
four
days
or
buy
nearly
two
fat
geese
for
his
day
wages
a
day
laborer
will
work
from
forty
to
fifty
days
now
to
earn
the
price
of
an
ox
on
the
hoof
and
it
was
about
the
same
at
the
close
of
the
thirteenth
century
when
a
fat
hog
costs
less
than
a
dollar
a
man
wages
at
eight
cents
a
day
are
not
too
low
when
a
gallon
of
good
ale
can
be
obtained
for
two
cents
no
workman
is
likely
to
go
dry
when
a
gallon
of
red
wine
can
be
obtained
for
a
wages
it
is
hard
to
see
any
difference
between
a
workman
of
the
olden
time
and
the
present
in
this
regard
two
yards
of
cloth
made
a
coat
for
a
gentleman
and
cost
only
a
little
over
two
shillings
the
making
of
it
brought
the
price
of
it
up
to
two
shilling
and
six
pence
these
prices
are
taken
from
the
preciosum
of
bishop
fleetwood
who
took
them
from
the
accounts
kept
by
the
bursars
of
convents
fleetwood
book
is
accepted
very
generally
as
an
excellent
authority
in
the
history
of
economics
cobbett
in
his
history
of
the
protestant
reformation
has
made
an
exhaustive
study
of
just
this
question
of
the
material
and
economic
condition
of
the
people
of
england
before
and
since
the
reformation
he
says
these
things
prove
beyond
all
dispute
that
england
was
in
catholic
times
a
real
wealthy
country
that
wealth
was
generally
diffused
that

there
were

high
chancellor

under

king
a
century
after

thirteenth
has
this
to
say
with
regard
to
the
legal
and
economic
conditions
in
england
in
his
time
some
people
may
think
the
picture
he
gives
an
exaggeration
but
it
was
written
by
a
great
lawyer
with
the
definite
idea
of
giving
a
picture
of
the
times
and
under
ordinary
circumstances
we
would
say
that
there
could
be
no
better
authority
the
king
of
england
can
not
alter
the
laws
or
make
new
ones
without
the
express
consent
of
the
whole
kingdom
in
parliament
assembled
every
inhabitant
is
at
his
liberty
fully
to
use
and
enjoy
whatever
his
farm
produceth
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
increase
of
his
flock
and
the
like
all
the
improvements
he
makes
whether
by
his
own
proper
industry
or
of
those
he
retains
in
his
service
are
his
own
to
use
and
enjoy
without
the
let
interruption
or
denial
of
any
if
he
be
in
any
wise
injured
or
oppressed
he
shall
have
his
amends
and
satisfactions
against
the
party
offending
hence
it
is
that
the
inhabitants
are
rich
in
gold
silver
and
in
all
the
necessaries
and
conveniences
of
life
they
drink
no
water
unless
at
certain
times
upon
a
religious
score
and
by
way
of
doing
penance
they
are
fed
in
great
abundance
with
all
sorts
of
flesh
and
fish
of
which
they
have
plenty

they
are

throughout

in

goods
and

in

chapter
on

beginnings
of
modern
commerce
they
have
all
been
sure
however
that
it
is
quite
idle
to
talk
of
great
commercial
possibilities
at
a
time
when
ecclesiastical
regulations
forbade
the
taking
of
interest
this
would
seem
to
make
it
quite
impossible
that
great
commercial
transactions
could
be
carried
on
yet
somehow
these
people
succeeded
in
accomplishing
them
a
number
of
writers
on
economics
in
recent
years
have
suggested
that
possibly
one
solution
of
the
danger
to
government
and
popular
rights
from
the
accumulation
of
large
fortunes
might
be
avoided
by
a
return
to
the
system
of
prohibition
of
interest
taking
there
is
much
more
in
that
proposition
than
might
possibly
be
thought
by
those
who
are
unfamiliar
with
it
from
serious
consideration
they
did
succeed
in
getting
on
without
it
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
at
the
same
time
they
solved
the
other
problem
of
providing
loans
not
alone
for
business
people
but
for
all
those
who
might
need
them
we
are
solving
the
loan
shark
evil
at
the
present
time
in
nearly
the
same
way
that
they
solved
it
seven
centuries
ago
abbot
gasquet
in
his
parish
life
in
england
before
the
reformation
describes
the
methods
of
the
early
days
as
follows
the
parish
wardens
had
their
duties
towards
the
poorer
members
of
the
district
in
more
than
one
instance
they
were
guardians
of
the
common
chest
out
of
which
temporary
loans
could
be
obtained
by
needy
parishioners
to
tide
over
persons
in
difficulties
these
loans
were
secured
by
pledges
and
the
additional
security
of
other
parishioners
no
interest
was
charged
for
the
use
of
the
money
and
in
case
the
pledge
had
to
be
sold
everything
over
and
above
the
sum
lent
was
returned
to
the
borrower
the
eighteenth
lowest
of
centuries
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
nineteenth
century
and
especially
the
latter
half
of
it
saw
some
very
satisfactory
progress
over
immediately
preceding
times
with
the
recognition
of
this
fact
that
the
last
century
so
far
surpassed
its
predecessor
there
has
been
a
tendency
to
assume
because
evolution
occupies
men
minds
that
the
eighteenth
must
have
quite
as
far
surpassed
the
seventeenth
and
the
seventeenth
the
sixteenth
and
so
on
so
that
of
course
we
are
far
ahead
in
everything
of
the
despised
middle
ages
in
recent
years
indeed
we
have
dropped
the
attitude
of
blaming
the
earlier
ages
for
one
of
complacent
pity
that
they
were
not
born
soon
enough
and
therefore
could
not
enjoy
our
advantages
unfortunately
for
any
such
conclusion
as
this
the
term
of
comparison
nearest
to
us
the
eighteenth
century
is
without
doubt
the
lowest
hundred
years
in
human
accomplishment
at
least
during
the
past
seven
centuries
this
is
true
for
every
form
of
human
endeavor

every
phase

existence

according

so
far
throughout
this
whole

either
of
architecture

or

it
will
appear
that
the

represents
the
foot
of
a
hill
whose
gradual
descent
began
about
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
every
department
of
artistic
expression
the
taste
of
the
eighteenth

was
almost
the
worst
possible
the
monuments
that
we
have
from
that
time
in
the
shape
of
churches
and
municipal
buildings
are
few
but
such
as
they
are
they
are
the
least
worthy
of
imitation
and
the
art
ideas
they
represent
are
most
to
be
deprecated
of
any
in
the
whole
history
of
modern
art
perhaps
the
most
awful
arraignment
of
the
eighteenth
and
early
nineteenth
century
that
was
ever
made
is
that
of
cram
in
the
ruined
abbeys
of
great
britain
from
which
i
have
already
quoted
he
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
during
this
century
some
of
the
most
beautiful
sculptured
work
that
ever
came
from
the
hand
of
man
was
torn
out
of
the
ruins
of
mary
abbey
york
to
serve
no
better
purpose
than
to
make
lime
his
description
of
the
sculpture
of
the
abbey
will
give
some
idea
of
its
beauty
and
render
all
the
more
poignant
the
loss
that
was
thus
inflicted
on
art
he
says
most
wonderful
of
all
amongst
a
horde
of
smaller
statues
a
mutilated
fragment
of
a
statue
of
our
lady
and
the
holy
child
so
consummate
in
its
faultless
art
that
it
deserves
a
place
with
the
masterpieces
of
sculpture
of
every
age
and
race
here
in
this
dim
and
scanty
undercraft
is
an
epitome
of
the
english
art
of
four
centuries
precious
and
beautiful

power
of

to
describe
york
abbey
was
a
national
monument
the
aesthetic
and
historic
value
of
which
was

is
with
feelings

horror
and
unutterable
dismay
that
as
we
stand
beside
the
few
existing
fragments
realizing
the
irreparable
loss
they
make
so
clear
we
call
into
mind
henry
sacrilege
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
his
silly
palace
doomed
to
instant
destruction
and
the
crass
ignorance
and
stolidity
of
the
eighteenth
century
with
its
grants
of
building
material
and
the
mercenary
savagery
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
from
smoking
lime
kilns
rose
into
the
air
the
vanishing
ghosts
of
the
noblest
creations
that
owed
their
existence
to
man
nothing
is
sadder
to
realize
than
the
failure
of
appreciation
for
art
of
the
early
nineteenth
and
the
eighteenth
century
men
had
lost
apparently
all
proper
realization
of
the
value
of
artistic
effort
and
achievement
it
was
an
era
of
travel
and
commerce
and
unfortunately
of
industrial
development
as
a
consequence
in
many
parts
of
europe
and
especially
of
england
art
remains
of
inestimable
value
suffered
at
the
hands
of
utilitarians
who
found
them
of
use
in
their
enterprises
we
are
accustomed
to
rail
against
the
barbarians
and
the
turks
for
their
failure
to
appreciate
the
remains
of
latin
and
greek
art
and
for
their
wanton
destruction
of
them
but
what
shall
we
say
of
modern
englishmen
who
quite
as
ruthlessly
destroyed
objects
of
art
of
equal
value
at
least
with
roman
and
greek
while
the
great
body
of
the
nation
made
no
complaint
and
no
protest
was
heard
anywhere
in
the
kingdom
what
is
so
true
of
the
arts
is
as
might
be
reasonably
expected
quite
as
true
of
other
phases
of
intellectual
development
education
for
instance
is
at
the
lowest
ebb
that
it
has
reached
since
the
foundation
of
the
universities
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
in
germany
there
was
only
one
university
that
of
göttingen
in
which
there
was
a
professorship
of
greek
when
winckelmann
introduced
the
study
of
greek
into
his
school
at
seehausen
no
for
this
language
were
available
and
he
was
obliged
to
write
out
texts
for
his
students
what
was
the
case
in
germany
was
also
true
to
a
great
degree
of
the
rest
of
europe
leading
french
critics
ridiculed
the
greek
authors
homer
was
considered
a
ballad
singer
and
compared
to

voltaire

that
the
aeneid
of
virgil
was
superior
to
all
that
the
greek
writers
had
ever
done
no
edition
of
plato
had
been
published
in
europe
since
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
other
greek
authors
were
almost
as
much
neglected
and
of
true
scholarship
there
was
very
little
when
cardinal
newman
in
his
idea
of
a
university
wants
to
find
the
lowest
possible
term
of
comparison
for
the
intellectual
life
of
the
university
he
takes
the
english
universities
of
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
with
this
neglect
of
education
and
above
all
of
the
influence
that
greek
has
always
had
in
chastening
and
perfecting
taste
it
is
not
surprising
that
literature
was
in
every
country
of
europe
at
a
very
low
ebb
it
was
not
so
feeble
as
art
but
the
two
are
interdependent
much
more
than
is
usually
thought
only
france
has
anything
to
show
in
literature
that
has
had
an
enduring
influence
in
the
subsequent
centuries
when
we
compare
the
french
literature
of
the
eighteenth
with
that
of
the
seventeenth
century
however
it
is
easy
to
see
how
much
of
a
descent
there
has
been

this
same
decadence
of
literature
can
be
noted
even
more
strikingly
in

in
spain
and
in
italy
the
seventeenth
especially
the
first
half
of
it

the

of

the
eighteenth
century
produced
practically
nothing
that
was
to
live
and
be
a
vital
force
in
aftertimes
what
is
true
in
art
letters
and
education
is
above
all
true
in
what
men
did
for
liberty
and
for
their
hospital
organization
and
the
care
of
the
ailing
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
during

in

fact
that
attention
to
the
of
the
sick
improvements
in
hospitals
and
institutions
generally
and
to
details
of
nursing
care
had
a
period
of
complete
and
lasting
stagnation
after
the
middle
of

or
from
the
close
of
the
thirty

neither

took
any

did
nursing
remain
an

and
some
remnants

technique
survive
the
result
was
that
in
this
period
the
general
level
of
nursing
fell
far
below
that
of
earlier
periods
the
hospitals
of
cities
were
like
prisons
with
bare
undecorated
walls

little
dark
rooms
small
windows
where
no

could
enter

dismal

were
crowded

it

commonly

that
the
darkest

in
the
history

was
that
from
the

every

it
is
no

that
the

came
at
the
end

the
eighteenth

and
that
a
series
of
further
revolutions
during
the
nineteenth

were
required
to
win
back
some
of
the
rights
which
men
had
gained
for
themselves
in

then
lost

into
a
state
of
decadence
out
of

we

reached
quite
the
level
of
human
liberty

of
christian
democracy
that
our

had
secured
seven
centuries
ago
with
these
considerations
in
mind
it
is
easier
to
understand
how
men
in
the
later
nineteenth
century
and
beginning

century
are
prone
to
think
of
their
periods
as
representing
an
acme
in
the
course

there
is
no

that
we
are
far
above
the
eighteenth
century
that
however
was
a
deep
valley
in
human
accomplishment
indeed
a
veritable
slough
of
despond
out
of
which
we
climbed
and
looking
back
are
prone
to
think
how
fortunate
we
are
in
having
ascended
so
high
though
beyond
our
vision
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
the
hills
rise
much
higher
into
the

aspiration
and

excellence
than
anything
that
we
have
attained
as
yet
indeed
whenever
we
try
to
do
serious
work
at
the
present
time
we
confessedly
go
back
from
four
to
seven
centuries
for
the

that
we
must
follow
with

betokens
that
the
time
has
come

our
teachers
have
the
leisure
to
look
backward
to
what
has
been
accomplished
the
sketches
are
extremely
entertaining
and
useful
perhaps
the
most
striking
thing
is
that
everyone
of
the
men
described
was
of
the
catholic
faith
and
the
dominant
idea
is
that
great
scientific
work
is
not

glance
at

by

who
are
noted

capable
of
taking
a
serious
interest
in
the
wonderful
phenomena

the

is
delightful
to
read
owing
to
the
graceful
literary
style
common
to
both
authors
one
not
having
the
slightest
acquaintance

will
find
the

of
absorbing
interest

treating
in
a
human
way

with
literary

the
life
work
of
some
of
the
greatest
men
of

times
and
moreover
in
the
course

his
reading
he
will
incidentally
obtain
a
sound
knowledge
of
the
main
principles
upon
which
almost
all

shining
example

of

seems
just

dark

removes
