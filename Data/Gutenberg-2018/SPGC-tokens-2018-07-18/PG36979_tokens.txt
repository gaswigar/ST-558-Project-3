introduction
the
palms
of
the
hands
and
the
soles
of
the
feet
are
covered
with
two
totally
distinct
classes
of
marks
the
most
conspicuous
are
the
creases
or
folds
of
the
skin
which
interest
the
followers
of
palmistry
but
which
are
no
more
significant
to
others
than
the
creases
in
old
clothes
they
show
the
lines
of
most
frequent
flexure
and
nothing
more
the
least
conspicuous
marks
but
the
most
numerous
by
far
are
the
papillary
ridges
they
form
the
subject
of
the
present
book
if
they
had
been
only
twice
as
large
as
they
are
they
would
have
attracted
general
attention
and
been
commented
on
from
the
earliest
times
had
dean
swift
known
and
thought
of
them
when
writing
about
the
brobdingnags
whom
he
constructs
on
a
scale
twelve
times
as
great
as
our
own
he
would
certainly
have
made
gulliver
express
horror
at
the
ribbed
fingers
of
the
giants
who
handled
him
the
ridges
on
their
palms
would
have
been
as
broad
as
the
thongs
of
our
let
no
one
despise
the
ridges
on
account
of
their
smallness
for
they
are
in
some
respects
the
most
important
of
all
anthropological
data
we
shall
see
that
they
form
patterns
considerable
in
size
and
of
a
curious
variety
of
shape
whose
boundaries
can
be
firmly
outlined
and
which
are
little
worlds
in
themselves
they
have
the
unique
merit
of
retaining
all
their
peculiarities
unchanged
throughout
life
and
afford
in
consequence
an
incomparably
surer
criterion
of
identity
than
any
other
bodily
feature
they
may
be
made
to
throw
welcome
light
on
some
of
the
most
interesting
biological
questions
of
the
day
such
as
heredity
symmetry
correlation
and
the
nature
of
genera
and
species
a
representation
of
their
lineations
is
easily
secured
in
a
form
by
inking
the
fingers
in
the
way
that
will
be
explained
and
pressing
them
on
paper
there
is
no
prejudice
to
be
overcome
in
procuring
these
most
trustworthy
no
vanity
to
be
pacified
no
untruths
to
be
guarded
against
my
attention
was
first
drawn
to
the
ridges
in
when
preparing
a
lecture
on
personal
identification
for
the
royal
institution
which
had
for
its
principal
object
an
account
of
the
anthropometric
method
of
bertillon
then
newly
introduced
into
the
prison
administration
of
france
wishing
to
treat
the
subject
generally
and
having
a
vague
knowledge
of
the
value
sometimes
assigned
to
finger
marks
i
made
inquiries
and
was
surprised
to
find
both
how
much
had
been
done
and
how
much
there
remained
to
do
before
establishing
their
theoretical
value
and
practical
utility
enough
was
then
seen
to
show
that
the
subject
was
of
real
importance
and
i
resolved
to
investigate
it
all
the
more
so
as
the
modern
processes
of
photographic
printing
would
enable
the
evidence
of
such
results
as
might
be
arrived
at
to
be
presented
to
the
reader
on
an
enlarged
and
easily
legible
form
and
in
a
trustworthy
shape
those
that
are
put
forward
in
the
following
pages
admit
of
considerable
extension
and
improvement
and
it
is
only
the
fact
that
an
account
of
them
seems
useful
which
causes
me
to
delay
no
further
before
submitting
what
has
thus
far
been
attained
to
the
criticism
of
others
i

this
first
and
introductory
chapter
contains
a
brief
and
orderly
summary
of
the
contents
of
those
that
follow
the
second
chapter
treats
of
the
previous
employment
of
finger
prints
among
various
nations
which
has
been
almost
wholly
confined
to
making
daubs
without
paying
any
regard
to
the
delicate
lineations
with
which
this
book
is
alone
concerned
their
object
was
partly
superstitious
and
partly
ceremonial
superstitious
so
far
as
a
personal
contact
between
the
finger
and
the
document
was
supposed
to
be
of
mysterious
efficacy
ceremonial
as
a
formal
act
whose
due
performance
in
the
presence
of
others
could
be
attested
a
few
scattered
instances
are
mentioned
of
persons
who
had
made
finger
prints
with
enough
care
to
show
their
lineations
and
who
had
studied
them
some
few
of
these
had
used
them
as
signatures
attention
is
especially
drawn
to
sir
william
herschel
who
brought
the
method
of
finger
prints
into
regular
official
employment
when
he
was
collector
or
chief
administrator
of
the
hooghly
district
in
bengal
and
my
large
indebtedness
to
him
is
expressed
in
this
chapter
and
in
other
places
in
the
third
chapter
various
methods
of
making
good
prints
from
the
fingers
are
described
at
length
and
more
especially
that
which
i
have
now
adopted
on
a
somewhat
large
scale
at
my
anthropometric
laboratory
which
through
the
kindness
of
the
authorities
of
south
kensington
is
at
present
lodged
in
the
galleries
of
their
science
collections
there
the
ten
digits
of
both
hands
of
all
the
persons
who
come
to
be
measured
are
impressed
with
clearness
and
rapidity
and
a
very
large
collection
of
prints
is
steadily
accumulating
each
set
being
as
we
shall
see
a
that
differentiates
the
person
who
made
it
throughout
the
whole
of
his
life
from
all
the
rest
of
mankind
descriptions
are
also
given
of
various
methods
of
enlarging
a
finger
print
to
a
convenient
size
when
it
is
desired
to
examine
it
closely
photography
is
the
readiest
of
all
on
the
other
hand
the
prism
as
in
a
camera
lucida
has
merits
of
its
own
and
so
has
an
enlarging
pantagraph
when
it
is
furnished
with
a
small
microscope
and
cross
wires
to
serve
as
a
pointer
in
the
fourth
chapter
the
character
and
purpose
of
the
ridges
whose
lineations
appear
in
the
finger
print
are
discussed
they
have
been
the
topic
of
a
considerable
amount
of
careful
physiological
study
in
late
years
by
writers
who
have
investigated
their
development
in
early
periods
of
unborn
life
as
well
as
their
evolutionary
history
they
are
perfectly
defined
in
the
monkeys
but
appear
in
a
much
less
advanced
stage
in
other
mammalia
their
courses
run
somewhat
independently
of
the
lines
of
flexure
they
are
studded
with
pores
which
are
the
open
mouths
of
ducts
proceeding
from
the
somewhat
glands
which
secrete
perspiration
so
one
of
their
functions
is
to
facilitate
the
riddance
of
that
excretion
the
ridges
increase
in
height
as
the
skin
is
thickened
by
hard
usage
until
callosities
begin
to
be
formed
which
may
altogether
hide
them
but
the
way
in
which
they
assist
the
touch
and
may
tend
to
neutralise
the
dulling
effect
of
a
thick
protective
skin
is
still
somewhat
obscure
they
certainly
seem
to
help
in
the
discrimination
of
the
character
of
surfaces
that
are
variously
rubbed
between
the
fingers
these
preliminary
topics
having
been
disposed
of
we
are
free
in
the
fifth
chapter
to
enter
upon
the
direct
course
of
our
inquiry
beginning
with
a
discussion
of
the
various
patterns
formed
by
the
lineations
it
will
be
shown
how
systems
of
parallel
ridges
sweep
in
bold
curves
across
the
palmar
surface
of
the
hand
and
how
whenever
the
boundaries
of
two
systems
diverge
the
interspace
is
filled
up
by
a
compact
little
system
of
its
own
variously
curved
or
whorled
having
a
fictitious
resemblance
to
an
eddy
between
two
currents
an
interspace
of
this
kind
is
found
in
the
bulb
of
each
finger
the
ridges
run
in
parallel
lines
across
the
finger
up
to
its
last
joint
beyond
which
the
insertion
of
the
causes
a
compression
of
the
ridges
on
either
side
their
intermediate
courses
are
in
consequence
so
much
broadened
out
that
they
commonly
separate
and
form
two
systems
with
an
interspace
between
them
the
independent
patterns
that
appear
in
this
interspace
upon
the
bulbs
of
the
fingers
are
those
with
which
this
book
is
chiefly
concerned
at
first
sight
the
maze
formed
by
the
minute
lineations
is
bewildering
but
it
is
shown
that
every
interspace
can
be
surely
outlined
and
when
this
is
done
the
character
of
the
pattern
it
encloses
starts
conspicuously
into
view
examples
are
given
to
show
how
the
outlining
is
performed
and
others
in
which
the
outlines
alone
are
taken
into
consideration
the
cores
of
the
patterns
are
also
characteristic
and
are
described
separately
it
is
they
alone
that
have
attracted
the
notice
of
previous
inquirers
the
outlines
fall
for
the
most
part
into
nine
distinct
genera
defined
by
the
relative
directions
of
the
divergent
ridges
that
enclose
them
the
upper
pair
those
that
run
towards
the
may
unite
or
one
or
other
of
them
may
surmount
the
other
thus
making
three
possibilities
there
are
three
similar
possibilities
in
respect
to
the
lower
pair
so
as
any
one
of
the
first
group
may
be
combined
with
any
one
of
the
second
there
are
or
nine
possibilities
in
all
the
practice
of
somewhat
rolling
the
finger
when
printing
from
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
impress
enough
of
its
surface
to
ensure
that
the
points
at
which
the
boundaries
of
the
pattern
begin
to
diverge
shall
be
always
included
plates
are
given
of
the
principal
varieties
of
patterns
having
regard
only
to
their
more
fundamental
differences
and
names
are
attached
for
the
convenience
of
description
specimens
are
also
given
of
the
outlines
of
the
patterns
in
all
the
ten
digits
of
eight
different
persons
taken
at
hazard
to
afford
a
first
idea
of
the
character
of
the
material
to
be
dealt
with
another
and
less
minute
system
of
classification
under
three
heads
is
then
described
which
is
very
useful
for
rough
preliminary
purposes
and
of
which
frequent
use
is
made
further
on
it
is
into
arches
loops
and
whorls
in
the
arches
there
is
no
pattern
strictly
speaking
for
there
is
no
interspace
the
need
for
it
being
avoided
by
a
successive
and
regular
broadening
out
of
the
ridges
as
they
cross
the
bulb
of
the
finger
in
loops
the
interspace
is
filled
with
a
system
of
ridges
that
bends
back
upon
itself
and
in
which
no
one
ridge
turns
through
a
complete
circle
whorls
contain
all
cases
in
which
at
least
one
ridge
turns
through
a
complete
circle
and
they
include
certain
double
patterns
which
have
a
whorled
appearance
the
transitional
cases
are
few
they
are
fully
described
pictured
and
classified
one
great
advantage
of
the
rude
system
is
that
it
can
be
applied
with
little
risk
of
error
to
impressions
that
are
smudged
or
imperfect
it
is
therefore
very
useful
so
far
as
it
goes
thus
it
can
be
easily
applied
to
my
own
finger
prints
on
the
made
as
they
are
from
digits
that
are
creased
and
roughened
by
seventy
years
of
life
and
whose
impressions
have
been
closely
clipped
in
order
to
fit
them
into
a
limited
space
a
third
method
of
classification
is
determined
by
the
origin
of
the
ridges
which
supply
the
interspace
whether
it
be
from
the
thumb
side
or
the
side
in
other
words
from
the
inner
or
the
outer
side
lastly
a
translation
from
the
latin
is
given
of
the
famous
thesis
or
of
purkenje
delivered
at
the
university
of
breslau
in
together
with
his
illustrations
it
is
a
very
rare
pamphlet
and
has
the
great
merit
of
having
first
drawn
attention
to
the
patterns
and
attempted
to
classify
them
in
the
sixth
chapter
we
reach
the
question
of
persistence
whether
or
no
the
patterns
are
so
durable
as
to
afford
a
sure
basis
for
identification
the
answer
was
different
from
what
had
been
expected
so
far
as
the
proportions
of
the
patterns
go
they
are
absolutely
fixed
even
in
the
adult
inasmuch
as
they
change
with
the
shape
of
the
finger
if
the
finger
is
plumped
out
or
emaciated
or
variously
deformed
by
usage
gout
or
age
the
proportions
of
the
pattern
will
vary
also
two
prints
of
the
same
finger
one
taken
before
and
the
other
after
an
interval
of
many
years
can
not
be
expected
to
be
as
closely
alike
as
two
prints
similarly
made
from
the
same
woodcut
they
are
far
from
satisfying
the
shrewd
test
of
the
stereoscope
which
shows
if
there
has
been
an
alteration
even
of
a
letter
in
two
otherwise
duplicate
pages
of
print
the
measurements
vary
at
different
periods
even
in
the
adult
just
as
much
if
not
more
than
his
height
span
and
the
lengths
of
his
several
limbs
on
the
other
hand
the
numerous
bifurcations
origins
islands
and
enclosures
in
the
ridges
that
compose
the
pattern
are
proved
to
be
beyond
a
comparison
is
made
between
the
pattern
on
a
finger
and
one
on
a
piece
of
lace
the
latter
may
be
stretched
or
shrunk
as
a
whole
but
the
threads
of
which
it
is
made
retain
their
respective
peculiarities
the
evidence
on
which
these
conclusions
are
founded
is
considerable
and
almost
wholly
derived
from
the
collections
made
by
sir
herschel
who
most
kindly
placed
them
at
my
disposal
they
refer
to
one
or
more
fingers
and
in
a
few
instances
to
the
whole
hand
of
fifteen
different
persons
the
intervals
before
and
after
which
the
prints
were
taken
amount
in
some
cases
to
thirty
years
some
of
them
reach
from
babyhood
to
boyhood
some
from
childhood
to
youth
some
from
youth
to
advanced
middle
age
one
from
middle
life
to
incipient
old
age
these
four
stages
nearly
include
the
whole
of
the
ordinary
life
of
man
i
have
compared
altogether
some
points
of
reference
in
these
couplets
of
impressions
and
only
found
a
single
instance
of
discordance
in
which
a
ridge
that
was
cleft
in
a
child
became
united
in
later
years
photographic
enlargements
are
given
in
illustration
which
include
between
them
a
total
of
pairs
of
points
of
reference
all
bearing
distinctive
numerals
to
facilitate
comparison
and
to
prove
their
unchangeableness
reference
is
made
to
another
illustrated
publication
of
mine
which
raises
the
total
number
of
points
compared
to
all
of
which
were
successful
with
the
single
exception
above
mentioned
the
fact
of
an
almost
complete
persistence
in
the
peculiarities
of
the
ridges
from
birth
to
death
may
now
be
considered
as
determined
they
existed
before
birth
and
they
persist
after
death
until
effaced
by
decomposition
in
the
seventh
chapter
an
attempt
is
made
to
appraise
the
evidential
value
of
finger
prints
by
the
common
laws
of
probability
paying
great
heed
not
to
treat
variations
that
are
really
correlated
as
if
they
were
independent
an
artifice
is
used
by
which
the
number
of
portions
is
determined
into
which
a
print
may
be
divided
in
each
of
which
the
purely
local
conditions
introduce
so
much
uncertainty
that
a
guess
derived
from
a
knowledge
of
the
outside
conditions
is
as
likely
as
not
to
be
wrong
a
square
of
six
in
the
side
was
shown
by
three
different
sets
of
experiments
to
be
larger
than
required
one
of
four
in
the
side
was
too
small
but
one
of
five
appeared
to
be
closely
correct
a
interval
square
was
however
at
first
adopted
in
order
to
gain
assurance
that
the
error
should
be
on
the
safe
side
as
an
ordinary
finger
print
contains
about
of
these
squares
the
uncertainty
in
respect
to
the
entire
contents
of
the
pattern
to
this
cause
is
expressed
by
a
fraction
of
which
the
numerator
is
and
the
denominator
is
multiplied
into
itself
times
which
amounts
to
a
number
so
large
that
it
requires
eight
figures
to
express
it
a
further
attempt
was
made
to
roughly
appraise
the
neglected
uncertainties
relating
to
the
outside
conditions
but
large
as
they
are
they
seem
much
inferior
in
their
joint
effect
to
the
magnitude
of
that
just
discussed
next
it
was
found
possible
by
the
use
of
another
artifice
to
obtain
some
idea
of
the
evidential
value
of
identity
when
two
prints
agree
in
all
but
one
two
three
or
any
other
number
of
particulars
this
was
done
by
using
the
five
squares
of
which
may
be
considered
to
go
into
a
single
finger
print
being
about
the
same
as
the
number
of
the
bifurcations
origins
and
other
points
of
comparison
the
accidental
similarity
in
their
numbers
enables
us
to
treat
them
roughly
as
equivalent
on
this
basis
the
method
of
binomial
calculation
is
easily
applied
with
the
general
result
that
notwithstanding
a
failure
of
evidence
in
a
few
points
as
to
the
identity
of
two
sets
of
prints
each
say
of
three
fingers
amply
enough
evidence
would
be
supplied
by
the
remainder
to
prevent
any
doubt
that
the
two
sets
of
prints
were
made
by
the
same
person
when
a
close
correspondence
exists
in
respect
to
all
the
ten
digits
the
thoroughness
of
the
differentiation
of
each
man
from
all
the
rest
of
the
human
species
is
multiplied
to
an
extent
far
beyond
the
capacity
of
human
imagination
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
evidential
value
of
identity
afforded
by
prints
of
two
or
three
of
the
fingers
is
so
great
as
to
render
it
superfluous
to
seek
confirmation
from
other
sources
the
eighth
chapter
deals
with
the
frequency
with
which
the
several
kinds
of
patterns
appear
on
the
different
digits
of
the
same
person
severally
and
in
connection
the
subject
is
a
curious
one
and
the
inquiry
establishes
unexpected
relationships
and
distinctions
between
different
fingers
and
between
the
two
hands
to
whose
origin
there
is
at
present
no
clue
the
relationships
are
themselves
connected
in
the
following
way
calling
any
two
digits
on
one
of
the
hands
by
the
letters
a
and
b
respectively
and
the
digit
on
the
other
hand
that
corresponds
to
b
by
the
symbol
then
the
kinship
between
a
and
is
identical
in
a
statistical
sense
with
the
kinship
between
a
and
b
the
chief
novelty
in
this
chapter
is
an
attempt
to
classify
nearness
of
relationship
upon
a
centesimal
scale
in
which
the
number
of
correspondences
due
to
mere
chance
counts
as
and
complete
identity
as
it
seems
reasonable
to
adopt
the
scale
with
only
slight
reservation
when
the
average
numbers
of
the
arches
loops
and
whorls
are
respectively
the
same
in
the
two
kinds
of
digit
which
are
compared
together
but
when
they
differ
greatly
there
are
no
means
free
from
objection
of
determining
the
division
of
the
scale
so
the
results
if
noted
at
all
are
subject
to
grave
doubt
applying
this
scale
it
appears
that
digits
on
opposite
hands
which
bear
the
same
name
are
more
nearly
related
together
than
digits
bearing
different
names
in
about
the
proportion
of
three
to
two
it
seems
also
that
of
all
the
digits
none
are
so
nearly
related
as
the
middle
finger
to
the
two
adjacent
ones
in
the
ninth
chapter
various
methods
of
indexing
are
discussed
and
proposed
by
which
a
set
of
finger
prints
may
be
so
described
by
a
few
letters
that
it
can
be
easily
searched
for
and
found
in
any
large
collection
just
as
the
name
of
a
person
is
found
in
a
directory
the
procedure
adopted
is
to
apply
the
classification
to
all
ten
digits
describing
each
digit
in
the
order
in
which
it
is
taken
by
the
letter
or
as
the
case
may
be
and
arranging
the
results
in
alphabetical
sequence
the
downward
direction
of
the
slopes
of
loops
on
the
is
also
taken
into
account
whether
it
be
towards
the
inner
or
the
outer
side
thus
replacing
l
on
the
by
either
or
many
alternative
methods
are
examined
including
both
the
recognition
and
the
of
all
sloped
patterns
also
the
gain
in
differentiation
when
all
the
ten
digits
are
catalogued
instead
of
only
a
few
of
them
there
is
so
much
correlation
between
the
different
fingers
and
so
much
peculiarity
in
each
that
theoretical
notions
of
the
value
of
different
methods
of
classification
are
of
little
worth
it
is
only
by
actual
trial
that
the
best
can
be
determined
whatever
plan
of
index
be
adopted
many
patterns
must
fall
under
some
few
headings
and
few
or
no
patterns
under
others
the
former
class
resembling
in
that
respect
the
smiths
browns
and
other
common
names
that
occur
in
directories
the
general
value
of
the
index
much
depends
on
the
facility
with
which
these
frequent
forms
can
be
broken
up
by
the
rarer
forms
being
easily
dealt
with
this
branch
of
the
subject
has
however
been
but
lightly
touched
under
the
belief
that
experience
with
larger
collections
than
my
own
was
necessary
before
it
could
be
treated
thoroughly
means
are
however
indicated
for
breaking
up
the
large
battalions
which
have
answered
well
thus
far
and
seem
to
admit
of
considerable
extension
thus
the
number
of
ridges
in
a
loop
which
is
by
far
the
commonest
pattern
on
any
particular
finger
at
the
part
of
the
impression
where
the
ridges
are
cut
by
the
axis
of
the
loop
is
a
fairly
definite
and
effective
datum
as
well
as
a
simple
one
so
also
is
the
character
of
its
inmost
lineation
or
core
in
the
tenth
chapter
we
come
to
a
practical
result
of
the
inquiry
namely
its
possible
use
as
a
means
of
differentiating
a
man
from
his
fellows
in
civil
as
well
as
in
criminal
cases
the
need
of
some
such
system
is
shown
to
be
greatly
felt
in
many
of
our
dependencies
where
the
features
of
natives
are
distinguished
with
difficulty
where
there
is
but
little
variety
of
surnames
where
there
are
strong
motives
for
prevarication
especially
connected
with
and
pensions
and
a
proverbial
prevalence
of
unveracity
it
is
also
shown
that
the
value
to
honest
men
of
sure
means
of
identifying
themselves
is
not
so
small
among
civilised
nations
even
in
peace
time
as
to
be
disregarded
certainly
not
in
times
of
war
and
of
strict
passports
but
the
value
to
honest
men
is
always
great
of
being
able
to
identify
offenders
whether
they
be
merely
deserters
or
formerly
convicted
criminals
and
the
method
of
finger
prints
is
shown
to
be
applicable
to
that
purpose
for
aid
in
searching
the
registers
of
a
criminal
intelligence
bureau
its
proper
rank
is
probably
a
secondary
one
the
primary
being
some
form
of
the
already
established
bertillon
anthropometric
method
whatever
power
the
latter
gives
of
successfully
searching
registers
that
power
would
be
multiplied
many
hundredfold
by
the
inclusion
of
finger
prints
because
their
peculiarities
are
entirely
unconnected
with
other
personal
characteristics
as
we
shall
see
further
on
a
brief
account
is
given
in
this
chapter
of
the
bertillon
system
and
an
attempt
is
made
on
a
small
scale
to
verify
its
performance
by
analysing
five
hundred
sets
of
measures
made
at
my
own
laboratory
these
combined
with
the
quoted
experiences
in
attempting
to
identify
deserters
in
the
united
states
allow
a
high
value
to
this
method
though
not
so
high
as
has
been
claimed
for
it
and
show
the
importance
of
supplementary
means
but
whenever
two
suspected
duplicates
of
measurements
bodily
marks
photographs
and
finger
prints
have
to
be
compared
the
lineations
of
the
finger
prints
would
give
an
incomparably
more
trustworthy
answer
to
the
question
whether
or
no
the
suspicion
of
their
referring
to
the
same
person
was
justified
than
all
the
rest
put
together
besides
this
while
measurements
and
photographs
are
serviceable
only
for
adults
and
even
then
under
restrictions
the
finger
prints
are
available
throughout
life
it
seems
difficult
to
believe
now
that
their
variety
and
persistence
have
been
proved
the
means
of
classifying
them
worked
out
and
the
method
of
rapidly
obtaining
clear
finger
prints
largely
practised
at
my
laboratory
and
elsewhere
that
our
criminal
administration
can
long
neglect
the
use
of
such
a
powerful
auxiliary
it
requires
no
higher
skill
and
judgment
to
make
register
and
hunt
out
finger
prints
than
is
to
be
found
in
abundance
among
ordinary
clerks
of
course
some
practice
is
required
before
facility
can
be
gained
in
reading
and
recognising
them
but
not
a
few
persons
of
whom
i
have
knowledge
have
interested
themselves
in
doing
so
and
found
no
difficulty
the
eleventh
chapter
treats
of
heredity
and
affirmatively
answers
the
question
whether
patterns
are
transmissible
by
descent
the
inquiry
proved
more
troublesome
than
was
expected
on
account
of
the
great
variety
in
patterns
and
the
consequent
rarity
with
which
the
same
pattern
other
than
the
common
loop
can
be
expected
to
appear
in
relatives
the
available
data
having
been
attacked
both
by
the
method
and
by
a
much
more
elaborate
system
of
classification
described
and
figured
as
the
c
system
the
resemblances
between
children
of
either
sex
of
the
same
parents
or
more
briefly
fraternal
resemblances
as
they
are
here
called
for
want
of
a
better
term
have
been
tabulated
and
discussed
a
batch
of
twins
have
also
been
analysed
then
cases
have
been
treated
in
which
both
parents
had
the
same
pattern
on
corresponding
fingers
this
pattern
was
compared
with
the
pattern
on
the
corresponding
finger
of
the
child
in
these
and
other
ways
results
were
obtained
all
testifying
to
the
conspicuous
effect
of
heredity
and
giving
results
that
can
be
measured
on
the
centesimal
scale
already
described
but
though
the
qualitative
results
are
clear
the
quantitative
are
as
yet
not
well
defined
and
that
part
of
the
inquiry
must
lie
over
until
a
future
time
when
i
shall
have
more
data
and
when
certain
foreseen
improvements
in
the
method
of
work
may
perhaps
be
carried
out
there
is
a
decided
appearance
first
observed
by
howard
collins
of
whom
i
shall
again
have
to
speak
of
the
influence
of
the
mother
being
stronger
than
that
of
the
father
in
transmitting
these
patterns
in
the
twelfth
chapter
we
come
to
a
branch
of
the
subject
of
which
i
had
great
expectations
that
have
been
falsified
namely
their
use
in
indicating
race
and
temperament
i
thought
that
any
hereditary
peculiarities
would
almost
of
necessity
vary
in
different
races
and
that
so
fundamental
and
enduring
a
feature
as
the
finger
markings
must
in
some
way
be
correlated
with
temperament
the
races
i
have
chiefly
examined
are
english
most
of
whom
were
of
the
upper
and
middle
classes
the
others
chiefly
from
london
board
schools
welsh
from
the
purest
districts
of
south
wales
jews
from
the
large
london
schools
and
negroes
from
the
territories
of
the
royal
niger
company
i
have
also
a
collection
of
basque
prints
taken
at
cambo
some
twenty
miles
inland
from
biarritz
which
although
small
is
large
enough
to
warrant
a
provisional
conclusion
as
a
first
and
only
an
approximately
correct
description
the
english
welsh
jews
negroes
and
basques
may
all
be
spoken
of
as
identical
in
the
character
of
their
finger
prints
the
same
familiar
patterns
appearing
in
all
of
them
with
much
the
same
degrees
of
frequency
the
differences
between
groups
of
different
races
being
not
larger
than
those
that
occasionally
occur
between
groups
of
the
same
race
the
jews
have
however
a
decidedly
larger
proportion
of
whorled
patterns
than
other
races
and
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
make
an
assertion
about
a
peculiarity
in
the
negroes
had
not
one
of
their
groups
differed
greatly
from
the
rest
the
task
of
examination
has
been
laborious
thus
far
but
it
would
be
much
more
so
to
arrive
with
correctness
at
a
second
and
closer
approximation
to
the
truth
it
is
doubtful
at
present
whether
it
is
worth
while
to
pursue
the
subject
except
in
the
case
of
the
hill
tribes
of
india
and
a
few
other
peculiarly
diverse
races
for
the
chance
of
discovering
some
characteristic
and
perhaps
a
more
pattern
considerable
collections
of
prints
of
persons
belonging
to
different
classes
have
been
analysed
such
as
students
in
science
and
students
in
arts
farm
labourers
men
of
much
culture
and
the
lowest
idiots
in
the
london
district
who
are
all
sent
to
darenth
asylum
but
i
do
not
still
as
a
first
approximation
find
any
decided
difference
between
their
finger
prints
the
ridges
of
artists
are
certainly
not
more
delicate
and
close
than
those
of
men
of
quite
another
stamp
in
chapter
xiii
the
question
is
discussed
and
answered
affirmatively
of
the
right
of
the
nine
fundamentally
differing
patterns
to
be
considered
as
different
genera
also
of
their
more
characteristic
varieties
to
rank
as
different
genera
or
species
as
the
case
may
be
the
chief
test
applied
respected
the
frequency
with
which
the
various
loops
that
occurred
on
the
thumbs
were
found
to
differ
in
successive
degrees
of
difference
from
the
central
form
of
all
of
them
it
was
found
to
accord
with
the
requirements
of
the
law
of
frequency
of
error
proving
the
existence
of
a
central
type
from
which
the
departures
were
in
common
phraseology
accidental
now
all
the
evidence
in
the
last
chapter
concurs
in
showing
that
no
sensible
amount
of
correlation
exists
between
any
of
the
patterns
on
the
one
hand
and
any
of
the
bodily
faculties
or
characteristics
on
the
other
it
would
be
absurd
therefore
to
assert
that
in
the
struggle
for
existence
a
person
with
say
a
loop
on
his
right
middle
finger
has
a
better
chance
of
survival
or
a
better
chance
of
early
marriage
than
one
with
an
arch
consequently
genera
and
species
are
here
seen
to
be
formed
without
the
slightest
aid
from
either
natural
or
sexual
selection
and
these
finger
patterns
are
apparently
the
only
peculiarity
in
which
panmixia
or
the
effect
of
promiscuous
marriages
admits
of
being
studied
on
a
large
scale
the
result
of
panmixia
in
finger
markings
corroborates
the
arguments
i
have
used
in
and
elsewhere
to
show
that
organic
stability
is
the
primary
factor
by
which
the
distinctions
between
genera
are
maintained
consequently
the
progress
of
evolution
is
not
a
smooth
and
uniform
progression
but
one
that
proceeds
by
jerks
through
successive
sports
as
they
are
called
some
of
them
implying
considerable
organic
changes
and
each
in
its
turn
being
favoured
by
natural
selection
the
same
word
variation
has
been
indiscriminately
applied
to
two
very
different
conceptions
which
ought
to
be
clearly
distinguished
the
one
is
that
of
the
sports
just
alluded
to
which
are
changes
in
the
position
of
organic
stability
and
may
through
the
aid
of
natural
selection
become
fresh
steps
in
the
onward
course
of
evolution
the
other
is
that
of
the
variations
proper
which
are
merely
strained
conditions
of
a
stable
form
of
organisation
and
not
in
any
way
an
overthrow
of
them
sports
do
not
blend
freely
together
variations
proper
do
so
natural
selection
acts
upon
variations
proper
just
as
it
does
upon
sports
by
preserving
the
best
to
become
parents
and
eliminating
the
worst
but
its
action
upon
mere
variations
can
as
i
conceive
be
of
no
permanent
value
to
evolution
because
there
is
a
constant
tendency
in
the
offspring
to
regress
towards
the
parental
type
the
amount
and
results
of
this
tendency
have
been
fully
established
in
it
is
there
shown
that
after
a
certain
departure
from
the
central
typical
form
has
been
reached
in
any
race
a
further
departure
becomes
impossible
without
the
aid
of
these
sports
in
the
successive
generations
of
such
a
population
the
average
tendency
of
filial
regression
towards
the
racial
centre
must
at
length
counterbalance
the
effects
of
filial
dispersion
consequently
the
best
of
the
produce
can
not
advance
beyond
the
level
already
attained
by
the
parents
the
rest
falling
short
of
it
in
various
degrees
in
concluding
these
introductory
remarks
i
have
to
perform
the
grateful
duty
of
acknowledging
my
indebtedness
to
howard
collins
who
materially
helped
me
during
the
past
year
he
undertook
the
numerous
and
tedious
tabulations
upon
which
the
chapters
on
heredity
and
on
races
and
classes
are
founded
and
he
thoroughly
revised
nearly
the
whole
of
my
to
the
great
advantage
of
the
reader
of
this
book
chapter
ii
previous
use
of
finger
prints
the
employment
of
impressions
of
the
hand
or
fingers
to
serve
as
will
probably
be
found
in
every
nation
of
importance
but
the
significance
attached
to
them
differs
it
ranges
from
a
mere
superstition
that
personal
contact
is
important
up
to
the
conviction
of
which
this
book
will
furnish
assurance
that
when
they
are
properly
made
they
are
incomparably
the
most
sure
and
unchanging
of
all
forms
of
signature
the
existence
of
the
superstitious
basis
is
easily
noted
in
children
and
the
uneducated
it
occupies
a
prominent
place
in
the
witchcrafts
of
barbarians
the
modern
witness
who
swears
on
the
bible
is
made
to
hold
it
and
afterwards
to
kiss
it
he
who
signs
a
document
touches
a
seal
or
wafer
and
declares
that
this
is
my
act
and
deed
students
of
the
primitive
customs
of
mankind
find
abundant
instances
of
the
belief
that
personal
contact
communicates
some
mysterious
essence
from
the
thing
touched
to
the
person
who
touches
it
and
but
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
enter
further
into
these
elementary
human
reasonings
which
are
fully
described
and
discussed
by
various
writers
the
next
grade
of
significance
attached
to
an
impression
resembles
that
which
commends
itself
to
the
mind
of
a
hunter
who
is
practised
in
tracking
he
notices
whether
a
footprint
he
happens
to
light
upon
is
larger
or
smaller
broader
or
narrower
or
otherwise
differs
from
the
average
in
any
special
peculiarity
he
thence
draws
his
inferences
as
to
the
individual
who
made
it
so
when
a
chief
presses
his
hand
smeared
with
blood
or
grime
upon
a
clean
surface
a
mark
is
left
in
some
degree
characteristic
of
him
it
may
be
that
of
a
broad
stumpy
hand
or
of
a
long
thin
one
it
may
be
large
or
small
it
may
even
show
lines
corresponding
to
the
principal
creases
of
the
palm
such
hand
prints
have
been
made
and
repeated
in
many
nations
and
have
even
been
impressed
in
vermilion
on
their
state
documents
as
formerly
by
the
sovereign
of
japan
though
mere
smudges
they
serve
in
a
slight
degree
to
individualise
the
signer
while
they
are
more
or
less
clothed
with
the
superstitious
attributes
of
personal
contact
so
far
as
i
can
learn
no
higher
form
of
finger
printing
than
this
has
ever
existed
in
regular
and
use
in
any
barbarous
or
nation
the
ridges
dealt
with
in
this
book
could
not
be
seen
at
all
in
such
rude
prints
much
less
could
they
be
utilised
as
strictly
distinctive
features
it
is
possible
that
when
impressions
of
the
fingers
have
been
made
in
wax
and
used
as
seals
to
documents
they
may
sometimes
have
been
subjected
to
minute
scrutiny
but
no
account
has
yet
reached
me
of
trials
in
any
of
their
courts
of
law
about
disputed
signatures
in
which
the
identity
of
the
party
who
was
said
to
have
signed
with
his
finger
print
had
been
established
or
disproved
by
comparing
it
with
a
print
made
by
him
then
and
there
the
reader
need
be
troubled
with
only
a
few
examples
taken
out
of
a
considerable
collection
of
extracts
from
books
and
letters
in
which
prints
or
rather
daubs
of
the
above
kind
are
mentioned
a
good
instance
of
their
small
real
value
may
be
seen
in
the
china
branch
of
the
royal
asiatic
part
published
at
which
contains

the
first
person
who
appears
to
have
studied
the
lineations
of
the
ridges
as
a
means
of
identification
was
bewick
who
made
an
impression
of
his
own
thumb
on
a
block
of
wood
and
engraved
it
as
well
as
an
impression
of
a
finger
they
were
used
as
fanciful
designs
for
his
illustrated
books
occasional
instances
of
careful
study
may
also
be
noted
such
as
that
of

have
taken
much
pains

of

a
print

he
had
accidentally
made

finger

and
finally
proposed
the
method
of
finger
prints
for
the
registration
of
chinese
whose
identification
has
always
been
a
difficulty
and
was
giving
a
great
deal
of
trouble
at
that
particular
time
but
his
proposal
dropped
through
again

american
geologist

on

duty

impression
made
by
his
finger
upon
the
order
after
first
pressing
it
on
his
office

he
was
good
enough
to
send
me
the
duplicate
of
one
of
these
cheques
made
out
in
favour
of
a
man
who

and
looked
decidedly
pretty
from
time
to
time
sporadic
instances
like
these
are
met
with
but
none
are
comparable
in
importance
to
the
regular
and
official
employment
made
of
finger
prints
by
sir
william
herschel
during
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
bengal
i
was
exceedingly
obliged
to
him
for
much
valuable
information
when
first
commencing
this
study
and
have
been
almost
wholly
indebted
to
his
kindness
for
the
materials
used
in
this
book
for
proving
the
persistence
of
the
lineations
throughout
life
sir
william
herschel
has
presented
me
with
one
of
the
two
original
contracts
in
bengali
dated
which
suggested
to
his
mind
the
idea
of
using
this
method
of
identification
it
was
so
difficult
to
obtain
credence
to
the
signatures
of
the
natives
that
he
thought
he
would
use
the
signature
of
the
hand
itself
chiefly
with
the
intention
of
frightening
the
man
who
made
it
from
afterwards
denying
his
formal
act
however
the
impression
proved
so
good
that
sir
herschel
became
convinced
that
the
same
method
might
be
further
utilised
he
finally
introduced
the
use
of
finger
prints
in
several
departments
at
hooghly
in
after
seventeen
years
experience
of
the
value
of
the
evidence
they
afforded
a
too
brief
account
of
his
work
was
given
by
him
in
xxiii
he
mentions
there
that
he
had
been
taking
finger
marks
as
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
had
introduced
them
for
practical
purposes
in
several
ways
in
india
with
marked
benefit
they
rendered
attempts
to
repudiate
signatures
quite
hopeless
finger
prints
were
taken
of
pensioners
to
prevent
their
personation
by
others
after
their
death
they
were
used
in
the
office
for
registration
of
deeds
and
at
a
gaol
where
each
prisoner
had
to
sign
with
his
finger
by
comparing
the
prints
of
persons
then
living
with
their
prints
taken
twenty
years
previously
he
considered
he
had
proved
that
the
lapse
of
at
least
that
period
made
no
change
sufficient
to
affect
the
utility
of
the
plan
he
informs
me
that
he
submitted
in
a
report
in
form
to
the
of
gaols
asking
to
be
allowed
to
extend
the
process
but
no
result
followed
in
at
the
request
of
the
governor
of
the
gaol
at
greenwich
sydney
he
sent
a
description
of
the
method
but
no
further
steps
appear
to
have
been
taken
there
if
the
use
of
finger
prints
ever
becomes
of
general
importance
sir
william
herschel
must
be
regarded
as
the
first
who
devised
a
feasible
method
for
regular
use
and
afterwards
officially
adopted
it
his
method
of
printing
for
those
purposes
will
be
found
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
iii
methods
of
printing
it
will
be
the
aim
of
this
chapter
to
show
how
to
make
really
good
and
permanent
impressions
of
the
fingers
it
is
very
easy
to
do
so
when
the
principles
of
the
art
are
understood
and
practised
but
difficult
otherwise
one
example
of
the
ease
of
making
good
but
not
permanent
impressions
is
found
and
should
be
tried
by
pressing
the
bulb
of
a
finger
against
glass
or
against
the
blade
of
a
razor
the
finger
must
be
oiled
as
by
passing
it
through
the
hair
if
it
be
moist
dry
it
with
a
handkerchief
before
the
oiling
then
press
the
bulb
of
the
finger
on
the
glass
or
razor
as
the
case
may
be
and
a
beautiful
impression
will
be
left
the
hardness
of
the
glass
or
steel
prevents
its
surface
from
rising
into
the
furrows
under
the
pressure
of
the
ridges
while
the
layer
of
oil
which
covers
the
bottom
of
the
furrows
is
too
thin
to
reach
down
to
the
glass
or
steel
consequently
the
ridges
alone
are
printed
there
is
no
capillary
or
other
action
to
spread
the
oil
so
the
impression
remains
distinct
a
merely
moist
and
not
oily
finger
leaves
a
similar
mark
but
it
soon
evaporates
this
simple
method
is
often
convenient
for
quickly
noting
the
character
of
a
finger
pattern
the
impression
may
be
made
on
a
a
or
even
an
if
nothing
better
is
at
hand
the
impression
is
not
seen
to
its
fullest
advantage
except
by
means
of
a
single
small
source
of
bright
light
the
glass
or
steel
has
to
be
so
inclined
as
just
to
reflect
the
light
into
the
eye
that
part
of
the
light
which
falls
on
the
oily
impression
is
not
so
sharply
reflected
from
it
as
from
the
surface
of
the
glass
or
steel
consequently
some
stray
beams
of
the
light
which
is
scattered
from
the
oil
reach
the
eye
while
all
of
the
light
reflected
from
the
glass
or
steel
passes
in
another
direction
and
is
unseen
the
result
is
a
brilliantly
luminous
impression
on
a
dark
background
the
impression
ceases
to
be
visible
when
the
glass
or
steel
is
not
well
polished
and
itself
scatters
the
light
like
the
oil
there
are
two
diametrically
opposed
methods
of
printing
each
being
the
complement
of
the
other
the
method
used
in
ordinary
printing
is
to
ink
the
projecting
surfaces
only
leaving
the
depressed
parts
clean
the
other
method
used
in
printing
from
engraved
plates
is
to
ink
the
whole
surface
and
then
to
clean
the
ink
from
the
projecting
parts
leaving
the
depressions
only
filled
with
it
either
of
these
two
courses
can
be
adopted
in
taking
finger
prints
but
not
the
two
together
for
when
they
are
combined
in
equal
degrees
the
result
must
be
a
plain
black
blot
the
following
explanations
will
be
almost
entirely
confined
to
the
first
method
namely
that
of
ordinary
printing
as
the
second
method
has
so
far
not
given
equally
good
results
the
ink
used
may
be
either
printer
ink
or
water
colour
but
for
producing
the
best
work
rapidly
and
on
a
large
scale
the
method
of
printer
ink
seems
in
every
respect
preferable
however
water
colour
suffices
for
some
purposes
and
as
there
is
so
much
convenience
in
a
pad
drenched
with
dye
such
as
is
commonly
used
for
hand
stamps
and
which
is
always
ready
for
use
many
may
prefer
it
the
processes
with
printer
ink
will
be
described
first
the
relief
formed
by
the
ridges
is
low
in
the
fingers
of
very
young
children
and
of
some
ladies
whose
hands
are
rarely
submitted
to
rough
usage
the
ridges
are
exceptionally
faint
their
crests
hardly
rise
above
the
furrows
yet
it
is
the
crests
only
that
are
to
be
inked
consequently
the
layer
of
ink
on
the
slab
or
pad
on
which
the
finger
is
pressed
for
the
purpose
of
blackening
it
must
be
its
thickness
must
be
less
than
half
the
elevation
of
the
ridges
for
when
the
finger
is
pressed
down
the
crests
displace
the
ink
immediately
below
them
and
drives
it
upwards
into
the
furrows
which
would
otherwise
be
choked
with
it
it
is
no
violent
misuse
of
metaphor
to
compare
the
ridges
to
the
crests
of
mountain
ranges
and
the
depth
of
the
blackening
that
they
ought
to
receive
to
that
of
the
snow
upon
the
mountaintops
in
the
early
autumn
when
it
powders
them
from
above
downwards
to
a
level
the
most
desirable
blackening
of
the
fingers
corresponds
to
a
snowfall
which
covers
all
the
higher
passes
but
descends
no
lower
with
a
finger
so
inked
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
fail
in
making
a
good
imprint
the
heaviest
pressure
can
not
spoil
it
the
first
desideratum
is
then
to
cover
the
slab
by
means
of
which
the
finger
is
to
be
blackened
with
an
extremely
thin
layer
of
ink
this
can
not
be
accomplished
with
printer
ink
unless
the
slab
is
very
clean
the
ink
somewhat
fluid
and
the
roller
that
is
used
to
spread
it
in
good
condition
when
a
plate
of
glass
is
used
for
the
slab
it
is
easy
by
holding
the
inked
slab
between
the
eye
and
the
light
to
judge
of
the
correct
amount
of
inking
it
should
appear
by
no
means
black
but
of
a
somewhat
light
brown
the
thickness
of
ink
transferred
by
the
finger
to
the
paper
is
much
less
than
that
which
lay
upon
the
slab
the
ink
adheres
to
the
slab
as
well
as
to
the
finger
when
they
are
separated
only
a
portion
of
the
ink
is
removed
by
the
finger
again
when
the
inked
finger
is
pressed
on
the
paper
only
a
portion
of
the
ink
that
was
on
the
finger
is
transferred
to
the
paper
owing
to
this
double
reduction
it
seldom
happens
that
a
clear
impression
is
at
the
same
time
black
an
ideally
perfect
material
for
blackening
would
lie
loosely
on
the
slab
like
dust
it
would
cling
very
lightly
to
the
finger
but
adhere
firmly
to
the
paper
the
last
preliminary
to
be
noticed
is
the
slowness
with
which
the
printer
ink
hardens
on
the
slab
and
the
rapidity
with
which
it
dries
on
paper
while
serviceable
for
hours
in
the
former
case
in
the
latter
it
will
be
dry
in
a
very
few
seconds
the
drying
or
hardening
of
this
oily
ink
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
loss
of
moisture
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
of
the
loss
of
the
contained
water
it
is
wholly
due
to
oxidisation
of
the
oil
an
extremely
thin
oxidised
film
soon
forms
on
the
surface
of
the
layer
on
the
slab
and
this
shields
the
portions
of
the
layer
from
the
air
and
retards
further
oxidisation
but
paper
is
very
unlike
a
polished
slab
it
is
a
fine
felt
full
of
minute
interstices
when
a
printed
period
is
placed
under
the
microscope
it
looks
like
a
drop
of
tar
in
the
middle
of
a
clean
the
ink
is
minutely
divided
among
the
interstices
of
the
paper
and
a
large
surface
being
thereby
exposed
to
the
air
it
oxidises
at
once
while
a
print
from
the
finger
upon
glass
will
not
dry
for
two
or
three
days
one
effect
of
oxidisation
is
to
give
a
granulated
appearance
to
the
ink
on
rollers
which
have
been
allowed
to
get
dirty
this
granulation
leaves
clots
on
the
slab
which
are
fatal
to
good
work
whenever
they
are
seen
the
roller
must
be
cleaned
at
once
the
best
ink
for
finger
printing
is
not
the
best
for
ordinary
printing
it
is
important
to
a
commercial
printer
that
his
ink
should
dry
rapidly
on
the
paper
and
he
does
not
want
a
particularly
thin
layer
of
it
consequently
he
prefers
ink
that
contains
various
drying
materials
such
as
litharge
which
easily
part
with
their
oxygen
in
finger
prints
this
rapid
drying
is
unnecessary
and
the
drying
materials
do
harm
by
making
the
ink
too
stiff
the
most
serviceable
ink
for
our
purpose
is
made
of
any
pure
drying
oil
or
oil
that
oxidises
rapidly
mixed
with
lampblack
and
very
little
else

importance
it

the
only
means
of

quickness
and
precision
over

large
surface
the
ingenuity
of
printers
during
more
than
four
centuries
in
all
civilised
nations
has
been
directed
to
invent
the
most
suitable
composition
for
rollers
with
the
result
that
particular
mixtures
of
glue
treacle
are
now
in

use

proportions
between

ingredients
differing

they
are
otherwise
nearly
equally
effective
in
cleansing
the

filter
as
it
saves
a
little
daily
expense
though
benzole
is
very
cheap
and
a
few
drops
of
it
will
clean
a
large
surface
the
has
already
been
spoken
of
the
more
fluid
it
is
the
better
so
long
as
it
does
not
run
a
thick
ink
can
not
be
so
thinned
by
adding
turpentine
as
to
make
it
equal
to
ink
that
was
originally
fluid
the
variety
of
oils
used
in
making
ink
and
of
the
added
materials
is
endless
for
our
purpose
any
oil
that
dries
and
does
not
spread
such
as
boiled
or
burnt
linseed
oil
mixed
with
lampblack
is
almost
all
that
is
wanted
the
burnt
oil
is
the
thicker
of
the
two
and
dries
the
faster
unfortunately
the
two
terms
burnt
and
boiled
linseed
oil
have
no
definite
meaning
in
the
trade
boiling
or
burning
not
being
the
simple
processes
these
words
express
but
including
an
admixture
of
drying
materials
which
differ
with
each
manufacturer
moreover
there
are
two
if
not
three
fundamentally
distinct
qualities
of
linseed
in
respect
to
the
oil
extracted
from
it
the
ink
used
in
the
laboratory
and
described
above
answers
all
requirements
many
other
inks
have
suited
less
well
less
even
than
that
which
can
be
made
in
a
very
homely
way
with
a
little
soot
off
a
plate
that
had
been
smoked
over
a
candle
mixed
with
such
boiled
linseed
oil
as
can
be
bought
at
unpretentious
oil
and
colour
shops
its
only
fault
being
a
tendency
to
run
and
a
comparatively
clean
duster
are
wanted
for
cleaning
the
slab
and
roller
without
scratching
them
the
small
holds
the
benzole
into
which
the
inked
fingers
are
dipped
before
wiping
them
with
the
duster

and
water

the
preliminary
cleansing
lying
flat
and
being
more
easily
manipulated
than
paper
are
now
used
at
the
laboratory
for
receiving
the
impressions
they
are
of
rather
large
size
inches
to
enable
the
prints
of
the
ten
digits
to
be
taken
on
the
same
card
in
two
rather
different
ways
see
plate
fig
and
to
afford
space
for
writing
notes
the
cards
must
have
a
smooth
and
yet
slightly
absorbent
surface
if
too
highly
glazed
they
cease
to
absorb
and
more
ink
will
remain
on
the
fingers
and
less
be
transferred
from
them
to
the
paper
a
little
trial
soon
determines
the
best
specimen
from
among
a
few
likely
alternatives
correspondence
cards
are
suitable
for
taking
prints
of
not
more
than
three
fingers
and
are
occasionally
employed
in
the
laboratory
paper
books
and
pads
were
tried
but
their
surfaces
are
inferior
to
cards
in
flatness
and
their
use
is
now
abandoned
the
cards
should
be
white
because
if
a
photographic
enlargement
should
at
any
time
be
desired
a
slight
tint
on
the
card
will
be
an
impediment
to
making
a
photograph
that
shall
be
as
sharp
in
its
lines
as
an
engraving
it
being
recollected
that
the
cleanest
prints
are
brown
and
therefore
not
many
shades
darker
than
the
tints
of
ordinary
cards
the
method
of
printing
at
the
laboratory
is
to
squeeze
a
drop
or
so
of
ink
on
to
the
slab
and
to
work
it
thoroughly
with
the
roller
until
a
thin
and
even
layer
is
spread
just
as
is
done
by
printers
from
one
of
whom
a
beginner
might
well
purchase
a
lesson
the
thickness
of
the
layer
of
ink
is
tested
from
time
to
time
by
taking
a
print
of
a
finger
and
comparing
its
clearness
and
blackness
with
that
of
a
standard
print
hung
up
for
the
purpose
close
at
hand
if
too
much
ink
has
been
put
on
the
slab
some
of
it
must
be
cleaned
off
and
the
slab
rolled
afresh
with
what
remains
on
it
and
on
the
roller
but
this
fault
should
seldom
be
committed
little
ink
should
be
put
on
at
first
and
more
added
little
by
little
until
the
required
result
is
attained
the
right
hand
of
the
subject
which
should
be
quite
passive
is
taken
by
the
operator
and
the
bulbs
of
his
four
fingers
laid
flat
on
the
inked
slab
and
pressed
gently
but
firmly
on
it
by
the
flattened
hand
of
the
operator
then
the
inked
fingers
are
laid
flat
upon
the
upper
part
of
the
side
of
the
card
plate
fig
and
pressed
down
gently
and
firmly
just
as
before
by
the
flattened
hand
of
the
operator
this
completes
the
process
for
one
set
of
prints
of
the
four
fingers
of
the
right
hand
then
the
bulb
of
the
thumb
is
slightly
on
the
inked
slab
and
again
on
the
lower
part
of
the
card
which
gives
a
more
extended
but
not
quite
so
sharp
an
impression
each
of
the
four
fingers
of
the
same
hand
in
succession
is
similarly
rolled
and
impressed
this
completes
the
process
for
the
second
set
of
prints
of
the
digits
of
the
right
hand
then
the
left
hand
is
treated
in
the
same
way
the
result
is
indicated
by
the
diagram
which
shows
on
what
parts
of
the
card
the
impressions
fall
thus
each
of
the
four
fingers
is
impressed
twice
once
above
with
a
simple
dab
and
once
below
with
a
rolled
impression
but
each
thumb
is
only
impressed
once
the
thumbs
being
more
troublesome
to
print
from
than
fingers
besides
the
cards
would
have
to
be
made
even
larger
than
they
are
if
two
impressions
of
each
thumb
had
to
be
included
it
takes
from
two
and
a
half
to
three
minutes
to
obtain
the
eighteen
impressions
that
are
made
on
each
card
the
is
similar
to
one
originally
made
and
used
by
sir
william
herschel
see
plate
fig
in
which
the
roller
and
its
bearings
are
drawn
of
the
same
size
as
those
i
use
a
small
cylinder
of
hard
wood
or
of
brass
tube
say
inch
long
and
or
inch
in
diameter
has
a
pin
firmly
driven
into
each
end
to
serve
as
an
axle
a
piece
of
tubing
is
drawn
over
the
cylinder
the
cylinder
thus
coated
with
a
soft
smooth
compressible
material
turns
on
its
axle
in
two
brackets
each
secured
by
screws
as
shown
in
plate
fig
to
a
board
say
inch
that
serves
as
handle
this
makes
a
very
fair
and
durable
roller
it
can
be
used
in
the
heat
and
damp
of
the
tropics
and
is
none
the
worse
for
a
wetting
but
it
is
by
no
means
so
good
for
delicate
work
as
a
cylinder
covered
with
roller
composition
these
are
not
at
all
difficult
to
make
i
have
cast
them
for
myself
the
mould
is
a
piece
of
brass
tube
polished
inside
a
thick
disc
with
a
central
hole
for
the
lower
pin
of
the
cylinder
fits
smoothly
into
the
lower
end
of
the
mould
and
a
ring
with
a
thin
bar
across
it
fits
over
the
other
end
the
upper
pin
of
the
cylinder
entering
a
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
bar
thus
the
cylinder
is
firmly
held
in
the
right
position
after
slightly
oiling
the
inside
of
the
mould
warming
it
inserting
the
disc
and
cylinder
and
fitting
on
the
ring
the
melted
composition
is
poured
in
on
either
side
of
the
bar
as
it
contracts
on
cooling
rather
more
must
be
poured
in
than
at
first
appears
necessary
finally
the
roller
is
pushed
out
of
the
mould
by
a
wooden
ramrod
applied
to
the
bottom
of
the
disc
the
composition
must
be
melted
like
glue
in
a
vessel
surrounded
by
hot
water
which
should
never
be
allowed
to
boil
otherwise
it
will
be
spoilt
harrild
best
composition
is
more
than
twice
the
cost
of
that
ordinarily
used
and
is
expensive
for
large
rollers
but
for
these
miniature
ones
the
cost
is
unimportant
the
mould
with
which
my
first
roller
was
made
was
an
old
pewter
squirt
with
the
nozzle
cut
off
its
piston
served
the
double
purpose
of

the
is
a
piece
of
thick
plate
glass
of
the
same
length
and
width
as
the
handle
to
the
roller
so
they
pack
up
easily
together
its
edges
are

over
which
the

has
been
evenly
distributed
by
dabbing
it
many
times
against

or

this
method
gives
good
results
but
is
slow
it
would
be
intolerably
tedious
to
employ
it
on
a
large
scale
on
all
ten
digits
of
many
persons
it
is
often
desirable
to
obtain
finger
prints
from
persons
at
a
distance
who
could
not
be
expected
to
trouble
themselves
to
acquire
the
art
of
printing
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
single
finger
print
on
these
occasions
i
send
to
them
each
consisting
of
two
pieces
of
thin
copper
sheeting
fastened
side
by
side
to
a
slip
of
pasteboard

from
touching

has

the

of
even
a
very
thin
layer
of
ink
seems
to
be
retained
for
an
indefinite
time
if
the
air
is
excluded
to
prevent
oxidisation
i
made
experiments
and
found
that
if
pieces
of
glass
photographic
quarter
plates
be
inked
and
placed
face
to
face
separated
only
by
narrow
paper
margins
and
then
wrapped
up
without
other
precaution
they
will
remain
good
for
a
year
and
a
half
a
slight
film
of
oxidisation
on
the
surface
of
the
ink
is
a
merit
not
a
harm
it
is
cleaner
to
work
with
and
gives
a
blacker
print
because
the
ink
clings
less
tenaciously
to
the
finger
consequently
more
of
it
is
transferred
to
the
paper
if
a
blackened
plate
becomes
dry
and
is
without
first
being
cleaned
the
new
ink
will
rob
the
old
of
some
of
its
oxygen
and
it
will
become
dry
in
a
day
or
even
less
prints
may
be
made
on
and
thence
transferred
to
stone
it
is
better
not
to
impress
the
fingers
directly
upon
the
stone
as
the
print
from
the
stone
would
be
reversed
as
compared
with
the
original
impression
and
mistakes
are
likely
to
arise
in
consequence
the
print
is
or
put
right
by
impressing
the
fingers
on
it
might
sometimes
be
desirable
to
obtain
rapidly
a
large
number
of
impressions
of
the
finger

of
a
suspected
person
in
this
case
lithography
would
be
easier
quicker
and
cheaper
than

saturated
with
an
aniline

if
the

touched
the

is
inked
and
if
the
circumstances
are
all
favourable
a
good

may
be
made

liability
to

the

without

attention
fresh
ink
being
added
at
long
intervals
the
advantage
of
a

over
an
ordinary

colour
is
that
it
percolates
the
silk
without
any
of
its
colour
being
kept
back
while
a
solution
of

gilbert

by

a
similar
process
was
employed
for
the
bengal
finger
prints
by
sir
herschel
who
sent
me
the
following
account
as
to
the
printing
of
the
fingers
themselves
no
doubt
practice
makes
perfect
but
i
took
no
pains
with
my
native
officials
some
dozen
or
so
of
whom
learnt
to
do
it
quite
well
enough
for
all
practical
purposes
from
bengali
written
instructions
and
using
nothing
but
a
kind
of
lampblack
ink
made
by
the
native
orderly
for
use
with
the
office
seal
a
batch
of
these
impressions
which
he
was
so
good
as
to
send
me
are
all
clear
and
in
most
cases
very
good
indeed
it
would
be
easier
to
employ
this
method
in
a
very
damp
climate
than
in
england
where
a
very
thin
layer
of
lampblack
is
apt
to
dry
too
quickly
on
the
fingers
as
from
engraved
professor
ray
lankester
kindly
sent
me
his
method
of
taking
prints
with
water
colours
you
take
a
watery
brushful
or
two
of
the
paint
and
rub
it
over
the
hands
rubbing
one
hand
against
the
other
until
they
feel
sticky
a
paper
tissue
is
best
placed
on
an
oval
cushion
the
shape
of
the
hand
should
be
ready
and
the
hand
pressed
not
too
firmly
on
to
it
i
enclose
a
rough
sample
done
without
a
cushion
you
require
a
cushion
for
the
hollow
of
the
hand
and
the
paint
must
be
rubbed
by
the
two
hands
until
they
feel
sticky
not
watery
this
is
the
process
of
printing
from
engravings
the
ink
being
removed
from
the
ridges
and
lying
in
the
furrows
blood
can
be
used
in
the
same
way
the
following
is
extracted
from
an
article
by
louis
robinson
in
the
may
i
found
that
direct
prints
of
the
infant
feet
on
paper
would
answer
much
better
than
photography
after
trying
various
methods
i
found
that
the
best
results
could
be
got
by
covering
the
foot
by
means
of
a
soft
stencil
brush
with
a
composition
of
lampblack
soap
syrup
and
ink
wiping
it
gently
from
heel
to
toe
with
a
silk
handkerchief
to
remove
the
superfluous
pigment
and
then
applying
a
moderately
flexible
paper
supported
on
a
soft
pad
direct
to
the
foot
a
curious
method
with
paper
and
ordinary
writing
ink
lately
contrived
by
forgeot
is
analogous
to
lithography
he
has
described
in
one
of
the
many
interesting
pamphlets
published
by
the
laboratoire
criminelle
of
lyon
rue
paris
his
new
process
of
rendering
visible
the
previously
invisible
details
of
such
faint
finger
prints
as
thieves
may
have
left
on
anything
they
have
handled
the
object
being
to
show
how
evidence
may
sometimes
be
obtained
for
their
identification
it
is
well
known
that
pressure
of
the
hand
on
the
polished
surface
of
glass
or
metal
leaves
a
latent
image
very
difficult
to
destroy
and
which
may
be
rendered
visible
by
suitable
applications
but
few
probably
have
suspected
that
this
may
be
the
case
to
a
considerable
degree
with
ordinary
paper

other
methods
of
a
generally
similar
kind
which
he
has
found
to
be
less
good
than
the
above
when
other
apparatus
is
not
at
hand
a
method
of
obtaining
very
clear
impressions
is
to
smoke
a
plate
over
a
lighted
candle
to
press
the
finger
on
the
blackened
surface
and
then
on
an
adhesive
one
the
following
details
must
however
be
borne
in
mind
the
plate
must
not
be
smoked
too
much
for
the
same
reason
that
a
slab
must
not
be
inked
too
much
and
the
adhesive
surface
must
be
only
slightly
damped
not
wetted
or
the
impression
will
be
blurred
a
crockery
plate
is
better
than
glass
or
metal
as
the
soot
does
not
adhere
to
it
so
tightly
and
it
is
less
liable
to
crack

comes
wholly
off

the

of

touch
it

a

it
was
my
fortune
as
a
boy
to
receive
rudimentary
lessons
in
drawing
from
a
humble
and
rather
grotesque
master
he
confided
to
me
the
discovery
which
he
claimed
as
his
own
that
pencil
drawings
could
be
fixed
by
licking
them
and
as
i
write
these
words
the
image
of
his
broad
tongue
performing
the
operation
and
of
his
proud
eyes
gleaming
over
the
drawing
he
was
operating
on
come
vividly
to
remembrance
this
reminiscence
led
me
to
try
whether
licking
a
piece
of
paper
would
give
it
a
sufficiently
adhesive
surface
it
did
so
nay
it
led
me
a
step
further
for
i
took
two
pieces
of
paper
and
licked
both
the
dry
side
of
the
one
was
held
over
the
candle
as
an
equivalent
to
a
plate
for
collecting
soot
being
saved
by
the
moisture
at
the
back
from
igniting
it
had
to
be
licked
two
or
three
times
during
the
process
and
the
impression
was
made
on
the
other
bit
of
paper
an
ingenious
person
determined
to
succeed
in
obtaining
the
record

a
finger
impression

hardly
fail
altogether
under
any
ordinary
circumstances
physiologists
who
are
familiar
with
the
revolving
cylinder
covered
with
paper
which
is
smoked
and
then
used
for
the
purpose
of
recording
the
delicate
movements
of
a
tracer
will
have
noticed
the
beauty
of
the
impression
sometimes
left
by
a
finger
that
had
accidentally
touched
it
they
are
also
well
versed
in
the
art
of
varnishing
such
impressions
to
preserve
them
in
a
durable
form
a
cake
of
blacklead
plumbago
such
as
is
sold
for
blackening
grates
when
rubbed
on
paper
leaves
a
powdery
surface
that
readily
blackens
the
fingers
and
shows
the
ridges
distinctly
a
small
part
of
the
black
comes
off
when
the
fingers
are
pressed
on
sticky
paper
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
ensure
good
prints
the
cakes
are
convenient
to
carry
and
cleanly
to
handle

and
still
more
whitening
mixed
with
size
may
be
used
in
the
same
way
but
it
gathers
in
the
furrows
not
on
the
ridges
give
undoubtedly
the
most
exact
representation
of
the
ridges
but
they
are
difficult
and
unsatisfactory
to
examine
puzzling
the
eye
by
showing
too
conspicuously
the
variation
of
their
heights
whereas
we
only
want
to
know
their
courses
again
as
casts
must
be
of
a
uniform
colour
the
finer
lines
are
indistinctly
seen
except
in
a
particular
light
lastly
they
are
both
cumbrous
to
preserve
and
easily
broken
a
impression
is
the
simplest
and
best
kind
of
cast
and
the
finger
need
not
be
burnt
in
making
it
the
plan
is
to
make
a
considerable
pool
of
flaming
stirring
it
well
with
the
still
unmelted
piece
of
the
stick
while
it
is
burning
then
blow
out
the
flame
and
wait
a
little
until
the
upper
layer
has
cooled
that
has
been
well
aflame
takes
a
long
time
to
harden
thoroughly
after
it
has
parted
with
nearly
all
its
heat
by
selecting
the
proper
moment
after
blowing
out
the
flame
the
wax
will
be
cool
enough
for
the
finger
to
press
it
without
discomfort
and
it
will
still
be
sufficiently
soft
to
take
a
sharp
impression
dentist
wax
which
is
far
less
brittle
is
easily
worked
and
takes
impressions
that
are
nearly
as
sharp
as
those
of
it
has
to
be
well
heated
and
kneaded
then
plunged
for
a
moment
in
cold
water
to
chill
the
surface
and
immediately
impressed
can
also
be
used
the
most
delicate
of
all
impressions
is
that
left
upon
a
thick
clot
of
varnish
which
has
been
exposed
to
the
air
long
enough
for
a
thin
film
to
have
formed
over
it
the
impression
is
transient
but
lingers
sufficiently
to
be
easily
photographed
it
happened
oddly
enough
that
a
few
days
after
i
had
noticed
this
effect
and
had
been
experimenting
upon
it
i
heard
an
interesting
memoir
on
the
minute
structure
of
striped
muscle
with
special
allusion
to
a
new
method
of
investigation
by
means
of
stamped
in
collodion
submitted
to
the
royal
society
by
john
berry
haycraft
in
which
an
analogous
method
was
used
to
obtain
impressions
of
delicate
microscopic
structures
are
valuable
in
themselves
and
the
negatives
serve
for
subsequent
they
are
unquestionably
accurate
and
the
labour
of
making
them
being
mechanical
may
be
delegated
if
the
print
be
in
printer
ink
on
white
paper
the
process
is
straightforward
first
of
obtaining
a
negative
and
afterwards
from
it
the
importance
of
the
paper
or
card
used
to
receive
the
finger
print
being
quite
white
has
already
been
pointed
out
an
imprint
on
white
is
beautifully
clear
some
of
the
photographs
may
be
advantageously
printed
by
the
process
the
paper
used
for
it
does
not
curl
when
dry
its
texture
is
good
for
writing
on
and
the
blue
colour
of
the
print
makes
handwriting
clearly
legible
whether
it
be
in
ink
or
in
pencil
prints
on
glass
have
great
merits
for
use
as
lantern
slides
but
it
must
be
recollected
that
they
may
take
some
days
to
dry
and
that
when
dry
the
ink
can
be
only
too
easily
detached
from
them
by
water
which
insinuates
itself
between
the
dry
ink
and
the
glass
of
course
they
could
be
varnished
if
the
trouble
and
cost
were
no
objection
and
so
preserved
the
negative
print
left
on
an
inked
slab
after
the
finger
has
touched
it
is
sometimes
very
clear
that
on
smoked
glass
better
and
on
smoked
mica
the
clearest
of
all
these
have
merely
to
be
placed
in
the
enlarging
camera
where
the
negative
image
thrown
on
paper
will
yield
a
positive
print
see
p
i
have
made
by
hand
many
enlargements
with
a
prism
camera
lucida
but
it
is
difficult
to
enlarge
more
than
five
times
by
means
of
it
so
much
shade
is
cast
by
the
head
that
the
prism
can
hardly
be
used
at
a
less
distance
than
inches
from
the
print
or
one
quarter
the
distance
inches
at
which
a
book
is
usually
read
while
the
paper
on
which
the
drawing
is
made
can
not
well
be
more
than
inches
below
the
prism
so
it
makes
an
enlargement
of
or
this
is
a
very
convenient
method
of
analysing
a
pattern
since
the
lines
follow
only
the
axes
of
the
ridges
as
in
plate
fig
the
prism
and
attached
apparatus
may
be
kept
permanently
mounted
ready
for
use
at
any
time
without
the
trouble
of
any
adjustment
an
enlarging
pantagraph
has
also
been
of
frequent
use
to
me
in
which
the
of
a
microscope
took
the
place
of
the
pointer
it
has
many
merits
but
its
action
was
not
equally
free
in
all
directions
the
enlarged
traces
were
consequently
jagged
and
required
subsequent
smoothing
all
enlargements
are
tedious
to
produce
as
the
total
length
of
lineations
to
be
followed
is
considerable
in
a
single
finger
print
made
by
dabbing
down
the
finger
their
actual
length
amounts
to
about
inches
therefore
in
a
enlargement
of
the
entire
print
the
pencil
has
to
be
carefully
directed
over
five
times
that
distance
or
more
than
feet
large
copies
of

at
the
place
where
the
space
covered
by

of

begins
to
broaden
out
very
rapidly
there
are
two
ways
in
which
the
necessary
supply
of
ridges
makes
its
appearance
the
one
is
by
a
series
of
successive
embranchments
fig
the
other
is
by
the
insertion
of
an
independent
system
as
shown
in
another
example
of

of
rarer
occurrence
is
found
in
the
system
th
on
the
ball
of
the
thumb
as
seen
in
far
more
definite
in
position
and
complex
in
lineation
are
the
small
independent
systems
which
appear
on
the
bulbs
of
the
thumb
and
fingers
they
are
more
instructive
to
study
more
easy
to
classify
and
will
alone
be
discussed
in
this
book
in
the
diagram
of
the
hand
fig
the
three
chief
cheiromantic
creases
are
indicated
by
dots
but
are
not
numbered
they
are
made
by
the
flexure
of
the
thumb
of
the
four
fingers
simultaneously
and
of
the
middle
ring
and
little
fingers
simultaneously
while
the
remains
extended
there
is
no
exact
accordance
between
the
courses
of
the
creases
and
those
of
the
adjacent
ridges
less
still
do
the
former
agree
with
the
boundaries
of
the
systems
the
accordance
is
closest
between
the
crease
and
the
ridges
in
th
nevertheless
that
crease
does
not
agree
with
the
line
but
usually
lies
considerably
within
it
the
crease
cuts
the
ridges
on
either
side
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
the
crease
is
usually
parallel
to
the
ridges
between
which
it
runs
but
is
often
far
from
accordant
with
the
line
the
creases
at
the
various
joints
of
the
thumb
and
fingers
cut
the
ridges
at
small
angles
say
very
roughly
of
degrees
the
supposition
is
therefore
untenable
that
the
courses
of
the
ridges
are
wholly
determined
by
the
flexures
it
appears
however
that
the
courses
of
the
ridges
and
those
of
the
lines
of
flexure
may
be
in
part
but
in
part
only
due
to
the
action
of
the
same
causes
the
fact
of
the
creases
of
the
hand
being
strongly
marked
in
the
child
has
been
considered
by
some
to
testify
to
the
archaic
and
therefore
important
character
of
their
origin
the
crumpled
condition
of
the
hand
of
the
infant
during
some
months
before
its
birth
seems
to
me
however
quite
sufficient
to
account
for
the
creases
i
possess
a
few
specimens
of
hand
prints
of
persons
taken
when
children
and
again
after
an
interval
of
several
years
they
show
a
general
accordance
in
respect
to
the
creases
but
not
sufficiently
close
for
identification
the
ridges
on
the
feet
and
toes
are
less
complex
than
those
on
the
hands
and
digits
and
are
less
serviceable
for
present
purposes
though
equally
interesting
to
physiologists
having
given
but
little
attention
to
them
myself
they
will
not
be
again
referred
to
the
ridges

speaking

an
artist
would
draw
if
dots
had
been
made
on
a
sheet
of
paper
in
positions
corresponding
to
the
several
pores

he
endeavoured
to
connect
them
by
evenly
flowing
curves

would
be
difficult
to
draw
a
pattern

these
conditions

within
definite
boundaries

can
not
be
matched

be

grow
simultaneously

continue

the
latest
and
best
investigations
on
the
evolution
of
the
ridges
have
been
made
by
h
klaatsch
he
shows
that
the
earliest
appearance
in
the
mammalia
of
structures
analogous
to
ridges
is
one
in
which
small
eminences
occur
on
the
ball
of
the
foot
through
which
the
sweat
glands
issue
in
no
particular
order
the
arrangement
of
the
papillæ
into
rows
and
the
accompanying
orderly
arrangement
of
the
sweat
glands
is
a
subsequent
stage
in
evolution
the
prehensile
tail
of
the
howling
monkey
serves
as
a
fifth
hand
and
the
naked
concave
part
of
the
tail
with
which
it
grasps
and
holds
on
to
boughs
is
furnished
with
ridges
arranged
transversely
in
beautiful
order
the
numerous
drawings
of
the
hands
of
monkeys
by
allix
may
be
referred
to
with
advantage
the
uses
of
the
ridges
are
primarily
as
i
suppose
to
raise
the
mouths
of
the
ducts
so
that
the
excretions
which
they
pour
out
may
the
more
easily
be
got
rid
of
and
secondarily
in
some
obscure
way
to
assist
the
sense
of
touch
they
are
said
to
be
moulded
upon
the
subcutaneous
papillæ
in
such
a
manner
that
the
ultimate
organs
of
touch
namely
the
pacinian
bodies
into
the
variety
of
which
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
enter
are
more
closely
congregated
under
the
bases
of
the
ridges
than
under
the
furrows
and
it
is
easy
on
those
grounds
to
make
reasonable
guesses
how
the
ridges
may
assist
the
sense
of
touch
they
must
concentrate
pressures
that
would
otherwise
be
spread
over
the
surface
generally
upon
the
parts
which
are
most
richly
supplied
with
the
terminations
of
nerves
by
their
means
it
would
become
possible
to
neutralise
the
otherwise
dulling
effect
of
a
thick
protective
epidermis
their
existence
in
transverse
ridges
on
the
inner
surface
of
the
prehensile
tails
of
monkeys
admits
of
easy
justification
from
this
point
of
view
the
ridges
so
disposed
can
not
prevent
the
tail
from
curling
and
they
must
add
materially
to
its
sensitiveness
they
seem
to
produce
the
latter
effect
on
the
hands
of
man
for
as
the
epidermis
thickens
under
use
within
moderate
limits
so
the
prominence
of
the
ridges
increases
supposing
the
ultimate
organs
of
the
sense
of
touch
to
be
really
congregated
more
thickly
under
the
ridges
than
under
the
furrows
on
which
there
has
been
some
question
the
power
of
tactile
discrimination
would
depend
very
much
on
the
closeness
of
the
ridges
the
experiment
with
the
two
points
of
a
pair
of
compasses
is
exactly
suited
to
test
the
truth
of
this
it
consists
in
determining
the
smallest
distance
apart
of
the
two
points
at
which
their
simultaneous
pressure
conveys
the
sensation
of
a
double
prick
those
persons
in
whom
the
was
short
might
be
expected
to
perceive
the
double
sensation
while
others
whose
was
wide
would
only
perceive
a
single
one
the
distance
apart
of
the
compass
points
and
the
parts
touched
by
them
being
the
same
in
both
cases
i
was
very
glad
to
avail
myself
of
the
kind
offer
of
titchener
to
make
an
adequate
course
of
experiments
at
professor
wundt
laboratory
at
leipzig
to
decide
this
question
he
had
the
advantage
there
of
being
able
to
operate
on
who
were
themselves
skilled
in
such
lines
of
investigation
so
while
his
own
experience
was
a
considerable
safeguard
against
errors
of
method
that
safety
was
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
his
experiments
were
conducted
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
competent
and
critical
friends
the
result
of
the
enquiry
was
decisive
it
was
proved
to
demonstration
that
the
fineness
or
coarseness
of
the
ridges
in
different
persons
had
no
effect
whatever
on
the
delicacy
of
their
tactile
discrimination
moreover
it
made
no
difference
in
the
results
whether
one
or
both
points
of
the
compass
rested
on
the
ridges
or
in
the
furrows
the
width
of
the
is
certainly
no
test
of
the
relative
power
of
discrimination
of
the
different
parts
of
the
same
hand
because
while
the
is
nearly
uniform
over
the
whole
of
the
palmar
surface
the
least
distance
between
the
compass
points
that
gives
the
sensation
of
doubleness
is
more
than
four
times
greater
when
they
are
applied
to
some
parts
of
the
palm
than
when
they
are
applied
to
the
bulbs
of
the
fingers
the
ridges
may
subserve
another
purpose
in
the
act
of
touch
namely
that
of
enabling
the
character
of
surfaces
to
be
perceived
by
the
act
of
rubbing
them
with
the
fingers
we
all
of
us
perform
this
as
it
were
intuitively
it
is
interesting
to
ask
a
person
who
is
ignorant
of
the
real
intention
to
shut
his
eyes
and
to
ascertain
as
well
as
he
can
by
the
sense
of
touch
alone
the
material
of
which
any
object
is
made
that
is
afterwards
put
into
his
hands
he
will
be
observed
to
explore
it
very
carefully
by
rubbing
its
surface
in
many
directions
and
with
many
degrees
of
pressure
the
ridges
engage
themselves
with
the
roughness
of
the
surface
and
greatly
help
in
calling
forth
the
required
sensation
which
is
that
of
a
thrill
usually
faint
but
always
to
be
perceived
when
the
sensation
is
analysed
and
which
becomes
very
distinct
when
the
indentations
are
at
equal
distances
apart
as
in
a
file
or
in
velvet
a
thrill
is
analogous
to
a
musical
note
and
the
characteristics
to
the
sense
of
touch
of
different
surfaces
when
they
are
rubbed
by
the
fingers
may
be
compared
to
different
qualities
of
sound
or
noise
there
are
however
no
pure
in
the
case
of

as
there
are

nearly
all
sounds

v
patterns

outlines
and

the
patterns
on
the
thumb
and
fingers
were
first
discussed
at
length
by
purkenje
in
in
a
university
thesis
or
i
have
translated
the
part
that
chiefly
concerns
us
and
appended
it
to
this
chapter
together
with
his
corresponding
illustrations
subsequent
writers
have
adopted
his
standard
types
diminishing
or
adding
to
their
number
as
the
case
may
be
and
guided
as
he
had
been
by
the
superficial
appearance
of
the
lineations
in
my
earlier
trials
some
three
years
ago
an
attempt
at
classification
was
made
upon
that
same
principle
when
the
experience
gained
was
instructive
it
had
seemed
best
to
limit
them
to
the
prints
of
a
single
digit
and
the
thumb
was
selected
i
collected
enough
specimens
to
fill
fourteen
sheets
containing
in
the
aggregate
prints
of
right
thumbs
arranged
in
six
lines
and
six
columns
and
another
set
of
fourteen
sheets
containing
the
corresponding
left
thumbs
then
for
the
greater
convenience
of
study
these
sheets
were
photographed
and
enlargements
upon
paper
to
about
two
and
a
half
times
the
natural
size
made
from
the
negatives
the
enlargements
of
the
right
thumb
prints
were
reversed
in
order
to
make
them
comparable
on
equal
terms
with
those
of
the
left
the
sheets
were
then
cut
up
into
rectangles
about
the
size
of
small
each
of
which
contained
a
single
print
and
the
register
number
in
my
catalogue
was
entered
on
its
back
together
with
the
letters
for
left
or
for
reversed
right
as
the
case
might
be
on
trying
to
sort
them
according
to
purkenje
standards
i
failed
completely
and
many
analogous
plans
were
attempted
without
success
next
i
endeavoured
to
sort
the
patterns
into
groups
so
that
the
central
pattern
of
each
group
should
differ
by
a
unit
of
equally
discernible
difference
from
the
central
patterns
of
the
adjacent
groups
proposing
to
adopt
those
central
patterns
as
standards
of
reference
after
tedious
some
sixty
standards
were
provisionally
selected
and
the
whole
laid
by
for
a
few
days
on
returning
to
the
work
with
a
fresh
mind
it
was
painful
to
find
how
greatly
my
judgment
had
changed
in
the
interim
and
how
faulty
a
classification
that
seemed
tolerably
good
a
week
before
looked
then
moreover
i
suffered
the
shame
and
humiliation
of
discovering
that
the
identity
of
certain
duplicates
had
been
overlooked
and
that
one
print
had
been
mistaken
for
another
repeated
trials
of
the
same
kind
made
it
certain
that
finality
would
never
be
reached
by
the
path
hitherto
pursued
on
considering
the
causes
of
these
doubts
and
blunders
different
influences
were
found
to
produce
them
any
one
of
which
was
sufficient
by
itself
to
give
rise
to
serious
uncertainty
a
complex
pattern
is
capable
of
suggesting
various
readings
as
the
figuring
on
a
may
suggest
a
variety
of
forms
and
faces
to
those
who
have
such
fancies
the
number
of
illusive
renderings
of
prints
taken
from
the
same
finger
is
greatly
increased
by
such
trifles
as
the
relative
breadths
of
their
respective
lineations
and
the
differences
in
their
depths
of
tint
the
ridges
themselves
are
soft
in
substance
and
of
various
heights
so
that
a
small
difference
in
the
pressure
applied
or
in
the
quantity
of
ink
used
may
considerably
affect
the
width
of
the
lines
and
the
darkness
of
portions
of
the
print
certain
ridges
may
thereby
catch
the
attention
at
one
time
though
not
at
others
and
give
a
bias
to
some
false
conception
of
the
pattern
again
it
seldom
happens
that
different
impressions
of
the
same
digit
are
printed
from
exactly
the
same
part
of
it
consequently
the
portion
of
the
pattern
that
supplies
the
dominant
character
will
often
be
quite
different
in
the
two
prints
hence
the
eye
is
apt
to
be
deceived
when
it
is
guided
merely
by
the
general
appearance
a
third
cause
of
error
is
still
more
serious
it
is
that
patterns
especially
those
of
a
spiral
form
may
be
apparently
similar
yet
fundamentally
unlike
the
unaided
eye
being
frequently
unable
to
analyse
them
and
to
discern
real
differences
besides
all
this
the
judgment
is
distracted
by
the
mere
size
of
the
pattern
which
catches
the
attention
at
once
and
by
other
secondary
matters
such
as
the
number
of
turns
in
the
whorled
patterns
and
the
relative
dimensions
of
their
different
parts
the
first
need
to
be
satisfied
before
it
could
become
possible
to
base
the
classification
upon
a
more
sure
foundation
than
that
of
general
appearance
was
to
establish
a
point
or
points
of
reference
in
the
patterns
this
was
done
by
utilising
the
centres
of
the
one
or
two
triangular
plots
see
plate
fig
which
are
found
in
the
great
majority
of
patterns
and
whose
existence
was
pointed
out
by
purkenje
but
not
their
more
remote
cause
which
is
as
follows
the
ridges
as
was
shown
in
the
diagram
plate
of
the
palm
of
the
hand
run
athwart
the
fingers
in
rudely
parallel
lines
up
to
the
last
joint
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
would
apparently
continue
parallel
up
to
the
extreme
but
the
presence
of
the
nail
disturbs
their
parallelism
and
squeezes
them
downwards
on
both
sides
of
the
finger
see
fig
consequently
the
ridges
that
run
close
to
the
tip
are
greatly
arched
those
that
successively
follow
are
gradually
less
arched
until
in
some
cases
all
signs
of
the
arch
disappear
at
about
the
level
of
the
first
joint
fig
usually
however
this
gradual
transition
from
an
arch
to
a
straight
line
fails
to
be
carried
out
causing
a
break
in
the
orderly
sequence
and
a
consequent
interspace
fig
the
topmost
boundary
of
the
interspace
is
formed
by
the
lowermost
arch
and
its
lowermost
boundary
by
the
topmost
straight
ridge
but
an
equally
large
number
of
ducts
exist
within
the
interspace
as
are
to
be
found
in
adjacent
areas
of
equal
size
whose
mouths
require
to
be
supported
and
connected
this
is
effected
by
the
interpolation
of
an
independent
system
of
ridges
arranged
in
loops
fig
also
plate
fig
or
in
scrolls
fig
also
fig
and
this
interpolated
system
forms
the
pattern
now
the
existence
of
an
interspace
implies
the
divergence
of
two
previously
adjacent
ridges
fig
in
order
to
embrace
it
just
in
front
of
the
place
where
the
divergence
begins
and
before
the
sweep
of
the
pattern
is
reached
there
are
usually
one
or
more
very
short
their
effect
is
to
complete
the
enclosure
of
the
minute
triangular
plot
in
question
where
there
is
a
plot
on
both
sides
of
the
finger
the
line
that
connects
them
fig
serves
as
a
base
line
whereby
the
pattern
may
be
oriented
and
the
position
of
any
point
roughly
charted
where
there
is
a
plot
on
only
one
side
of
the
finger
fig
the
pattern
has
almost
necessarily
an
axis
which
serves
for
orientation
and
the
pattern
can
still
be
charted
though
on
a
different
principle
by
dropping
a
perpendicular
from
the
plot
on
to
the
axis
in
the
way
there
shown
these
plots
form
to
my
system
of
outlining
and
subsequent
classification
it
is
therefore
extremely
important
that
a
sufficient
area
of
the
finger
should
be
printed
to
include
them
this
can
always
be
done
by
slightly
the
finger

result
being

language
of

projection

patterns
the
specimens
are
rolled
impressions
of
natural
size
the
next
step
is
to
give
a
clear
and
definite
shape
to
the
pattern
by
drawing
its
outline
fig
take
a
fine
pen
pencil
or
paint
brush
and
follow
in
succession
each
of
the
two
diverging
ridges
that
start
from
either
plot
the
course
of
each
ridge
must
be
followed
with
scrupulous
conscientiousness
marking
it
with
a
clean
line
as
far
as
it
can
be
traced
if
the
ridge
bifurcates
always
follow
the
branch
that
trends
towards
the
middle
of
the
pattern
if
it
stops
short
let
the
outline
stop
short
also
and
recommence
on
a
fresh
ridge
choosing
that
which
to
the
best
of
the
judgment
prolongs
the
course
of
the
one
that
stopped
these
outlines
have
an
extraordinary
effect
in
making
finger
markings
intelligible
to
an
untrained
eye
what
seemed
before
to
be
a
vague
and
bewildering
maze
of
lineations
over
which
the
glance
wandered
distractedly
seeking
in
vain
for
a
point
on
which
to
fix
itself
now
suddenly
assumes
the
shape
of
a
figure
whatever
difficulties
may
arise
in
classifying
these
figures
they
are
as
nothing
compared
to
those
experienced
in
attempting
to
classify
unoutlined
patterns
the
outlines
giving
a
precision
to
their
general
features
which
was
wanting
before
after
a
pattern
has
been
treated
in
this
way
there
is
no
further
occasion
to
pore
minutely
into
the
finger
print
in
order
to
classify
it
correctly
for
the
bold
firm
curves
of
the
outline
are
even
more
distinct
than
the
largest
capital
letters
in
the
of
a
book
a
fair
idea
of
the
way
in
which
the
patterns
are
distributed

given
by
plate

persons

taken
in
the
order
in
which
they
happened
to
present
themselves

result

greater
clearness

need
be
no
difficulty
in
remembering
the
meaning
of
these
terms
if
we
bear
in
mind
that
the
great
toes
are
undoubtedly
innermost
that
if
we
walked
on
all
fours
as
children
do
and
as
our
remote
ancestors
probably
did
the
thumbs
also
would
be
innermost

is
the
case
when
the
two
hands
are
impressed
side
by
side
on
paper
inner
and
outer
are
better
than
and

the
latter
can
not
be
applied

fingers

not
in
popular

further
peculiarity
of
appearing
unaltered

a
small
magnifying
power
is
needed
for
drawing
outlines
sufficient
to
allow
the
eye
to
be
brought
within
six
inches
of
the

it

only
at
that
short
distance
that
the
of

with
normal
sight
during
their
childhood
and
or
girlhood
are
able
to
read
as
closely
as
this
without
using
a
lens
the
range
in
adjustment
of
the
focus
of
the
eye
being
then
large
but
as
age
advances
the
range
contracts
and
an
elderly
person
with
otherwise
normal
eyesight
requires
glasses
to
read
a
book
even
at
twelve
inches
from
his
eye

double

enabling
me
to

at
a
distance
of
only
six
inches
perhaps
the
most
convenient
focus
for
a
lens
in
ordinary
use
is
inches
it
should
be
mounted
at
the
end
of
a
long
arm
that
can
easily
be
pushed
in
any
direction
sideways
backwards
forwards
and
up
or
down
it
is
undesirable
to
use
a
higher
power
than
this
unless
it
is
necessary
because
the
field
of
view
becomes
narrowed
to
an
inconvenient
degree
and
the
nearer
the
head
is
to
the
paper
the
darker
is
the
shadow
that
it
casts
there
is
also
insufficient
room
for
the
use
of
a
pencil
every
now
and
then
a
closer
inspection
is
wanted
for
which
purpose
a
doublet
of
focus
standing
on
three
slim
legs
answers
well
for
studying
the
markings
on
the
fingers
themselves
a
small
folding
lens
sold
at
opticians
shops
under
the
name
of
a
linen
tester
is
very
convenient
it
is
so
called
because
it
was
originally
constructed
for
the
purpose
of
counting
the
number
of
threads
in
a
given
space
in
a
sample
of
linen
it
is
equally
well
adapted
for
counting
the
number
of
ridges
in
a
given
space
whoever
desires
to
occupy
himself
with
finger
prints
ought
to
give
much
time
and
practice
to
drawing
outlines
of
different
impressions
of
the
same
digits
his
own
ten
fingers
and
those
of
a
few
friends
will
furnish
the
necessary
variety
of
material
on
which
to
work
he
should
not
rest
satisfied
until
he
has
gained
an
assurance
that
all
patterns
possess
definite
figures
which
may
be
latent
but
are
potentially
present
and
that
the
ridges
form
something
more
than
a
nondescript
congeries
of
ramifications
and
twists
he
should
continue
to
practise
until
he
finds
that
the
same
ridges
have
been
so
nearly
followed
in
duplicate
impressions
that
even
in
difficult
cases
his
work
will
rarely
vary
more
than
a
single
when
the
triangular
plot
happens
not
to
be
visible
owing
to
the
print
failing
to
include
it
which
is
often
the
case
when
the
finger
is
not
rolled
as
is
well
shown
in
the
prints
of
my
own
ten
digits
on
the
the
trend
of
the
ridges
so
far
as
they
are
seen
usually
enables
a
practised
eye
to
roughly
estimate
its
true
position
by
means
of
this
guidance
an
approximate
but
fairly
correct
outline
can
be
drawn
when
the
habit
of
judging
patterns
by
their
outlines
has
become
familiar
the
eye
will
trace
them
for
itself
without
caring
to
draw
them
and
will
prefer
an
unoutlined
pattern
to
work
upon
but
even
then
it
is
essential
now
and
then
to
follow
the
outline
with
a
fine
point
say
that
of
a
penknife
or
a
dry
pen
in
selecting
standard
forms
of
patterns
for
the
convenience
of
description
we
must
be
content
to
disregard
a
great
many
of
the
more
obvious
characteristics
for
instance
the
size
of
generally
similar
patterns
in
fig
will
be
found
to
vary
greatly
but
the
words
large
medium
or
small
may
be
applied
to
any
pattern
so
there
is
no
necessity
to
draw
a
standard
outline
for
each
size
similarly
as
regards
the
inwards
or
outwards
slope
of
patterns
it
is
needless
to
print
here
a
separate
standard
outline
for
either
slope
and
equally
unnecessary
to
print
outlines
in
duplicate
with
reversed
titles
for
the
right
and
left
hands
respectively
the
phrase
a
simple
spiral
conveys
a
general
idea
but
there
are
four
concrete
forms
of
it
see
bottom
row
of
plate
fig
which
admit
of
being
verbally
distinguished
again
the
internal
proportions
of
any
pattern
say
those
of
simple
spirals
may
vary
greatly
without
affecting
the
fact
of
their
being
simple
spirals
they
may
be
wide
or
narrow
at
their
mouths
they
may
be
twisted
up
into
a
point
plate
fig
or
they
may
run
in
broad
curls
of
uniform
width
fig
perhaps
the
best
general
rule
in
selecting
standard
outlines
is
to
limit
them
to
such
as
can
not
be
turned
into
any
other
by
viewing
them
in
an
altered
aspect
as
upside
down
or
from
the
back
or
by
magnifying
or
deforming
them
whether
it
be
through
stretching
shrinking
or
puckering
any
part
of
them
subject
to
this
general
rule
and
to
further
and
more
particular
descriptions
the
sets

and
figs
will

the
banded
duplex

common
in

rare
elsewhere
there
are
some
compound
patterns

the
spiral
in

the
circlet
in
loop
which
are
as
much
loops
as
whorls

the
twinned

of
more
frequent
occurrence

would
be
supposed
from
the
examination
of
impressions
as
the
only
part
of

resembles

so
in
a
strict

a
more
or
less
spiriform
arrangement
as
in
a
curious
optical
effect
is
connected
with
the
circular
forms

becomes
almost
annoying
when
many
specimens
are
examined
in
succession

seem
to
be
cones
standing
bodily
out

singular
appearance
becomes
still

marked

another
curious
effect
is

the
appearance
of

bluntly

other
and

stopping

seems
at
the
first
glance
to
run
beneath
it
as
if
it
were
a
plait

mode
of
ending
forms
a
singular
contrast

shown

where

themselves

deep
spiral

having
a
large
core
filled
with
upright
and
nearly
parallel
lines
occasionally

are
bulbous
and
resemble
the
commoner
monkey
type
see
when
the
direction
of
twist
is
described
the
language
must
be
unambiguous
the
following
are
the
rules
i
adopt
the
course
of
the
ridge
is
always
followed
the
of
the
pattern
and
not
away
from
it
again
the
direction
of
its
course
when
so
followed
is
specified
at
the
place
where
it
attains
its
point
or
that
nearest
to
the
its
course
at
that
point
must
needs
be
horizontal
and
therefore
directed
either
towards
the
inner
or
the
outer
side
the
amount
of
twist
has
a
strong
tendency
to
coincide
with
either
one
two
three
four
or
more
and
not
to
stop
short
in
intermediate
positions
here
are
indications
of
some
unknown
fundamental
law
analogous
apparently
to
that
which
causes
loops
to
be
by
far
the
commonest
pattern
the
classification
into
arches
loops
and
whorls
is
based
on
the
degree
of
curvature
of
the
ridges
and
enables
almost
any
pattern
to
be
sorted
under
one
or
other
of
those
three
heads
there
are
a
few
ambiguous
patterns
and
others
which
are
nondescript
but
the
former
are
uncommon
and
the
latter
rare
as
these
exceptions
give
little
real
inconvenience
the
classification
works
easily
and
well
arches
are
formed
when
the
ridges
run
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
the
bulb
of
the
digit
without
making
any
backward
turn
or
twist
loops
when
there
is
a
single
backward
turn
but
no
twist
whorls
when
there
is
a
turn
through
at
least
one
complete
circle
they
are
also
considered
to
include
all
duplex
spirals

the
chief
theoretical
objection
to
this
threefold
system
of
classification
lies
in
the
existence
of
certain
compound
patterns
by
far
the
most
common
of
which

whorls

called
them
whorls

a
practical
reason
which
is
cogent
in
an
imperfect
impression
such
as
is
made
by
merely
dabbing
the
inked
finger
upon

the
enveloping
loop
is
often
too
incompletely
printed
to
enable
its
existence
to
be
surely
ascertained
especially
when
the
enclosed
whorl
is
so
large
fig
that
there
are
only
one
or
two
enveloping
ridges
to
represent
the
loop
on
the
other
hand
the
whorled
character
of
the
core
can
hardly
fail
to
be
recognised
the
practical
difficulties
lie
almost
wholly
in
rightly
classifying
a
few
transitional
forms
diagrammatically

roughly

transitional
between

though
nearer
to
a
loop
than
an
arch
may
be
thought
transitional
in
the
same
way
but
it
has
an
incipient
curl
which
becomes
marked
in
while
it
has
grown
into
a
decided
whorl

also
be
compared
with
which

in
some
sense
a
stage

fully
developed

where
the
pattern
as
a
whole
has
a
slight
slope
but
is
otherwise
fairly
symmetrical
in
there
is
some
want
of
symmetry
and
a
tendency
to
the
formation
of
a
loop
on
the
right
side
refer
back
to
plate
fig
and
fig
it
is
a
transitional
case
between
a
tented

and
a

resemblance

the
or
more
briefly
the
system
of
classification
while
in
some
degree
artificial
is
very
serviceable
for
preliminary
statistics
such
as
are
needed
to
obtain
a
broad
view
of
the
distribution
of
the
various
patterns
a
minute
subdivision
under
numerous
heads
would
necessitate
a
proportional
and
somewhat
overwhelming
amount
of
statistical
labour
different
standard
varieties
are
by
no
means
an
extravagant
number
but
to
treat
as
thoroughly
as
three
would
require
eighteen
times
as
much
material
and
labour
effort
is
economised
by
obtaining
broad
results
from
a
discussion
of
the
classes
afterwards
verifying
or
extending
them
by
special
inquiries

in

possible

it

to
distinguish

by

thus
let

let
two

the

which
itself
affords
another
basis
for

the
resource
against
uncertainty
in
respect
to
ambiguous
or
difficult
patterns
is
to
compile
a
dictionary
of
them
with
the
heads
under
which
it
is
advisable
that
they
should
severally
be
classed
it
would
load
these

too
heavily
to
give
such
a
dictionary
here
moreover
it
ought
to
be
revised
by
many
experienced
eyes
and
the
time
is
hardly
ripe
for
this
when
it
is
it
would
be
no
difficult
task
out
of
the
large
number
of
prints
of
separate
fingers
which
for
instance
i
possess
some
to
make
an
adequate
selection
to
enlarge
them
photographically
and
finally
to
print
the
results
in
pairs
the
one
untouched
the
other

classified
it
may
be
asked
why
ridges
are
followed
and
not
furrows
the
furrow
being
the
real
boundary
between
two
systems
the
reply
is
that
the
ridges
are
the
easiest
to
trace
and
as
the
error
through
following
the
ridges
can
not
exceed
of
a
i
have
been
content
to
disregard
it
i
began
by
tracing
furrows
but
preferred
the
ridges
after
trial
it
has
been
already
shown
that
when
both
plots
are
present
plate
fig
they
form
the
termini
of
a
base
line
from
which
any
part
of
the
pattern
may
be
triangulated
as
surveyors
would
say
also
that
when
only
one
plot
exists
and
the
pattern
has
an
axis
which
it
necessarily
has
in
all
ordinary
and
cases
a
perpendicular
can
be
let
fall
upon
that
axis
whose
intersection
with
it
will
serve
as
a
second
point
of
reference
but
our
methods
must
not
be
too
refined
the
centres
of
the
plots
are
not
determinable
with
real
exactness
and
repeated
prints
from
so
soft
a
substance
as
flesh
are
often
somewhat
dissimilar
the
one
being
more
or
less
broadened
out
than
the
other
owing
to
unequal
pressure
it
is
therefore
well
to
use
such
other
more
convenient
points
of
reference
as
the
particular
pattern
may
present
in
loops
the
intersection
of
the
axis
with
the
summit
of
the
innermost

it
be
a

measurements
may
be
made
in
absolute
units
of
length
as
in
fractions
of
an
inch
or
else
in
millimetres
an
average
makes
however
a
better
unit
being
independent
of
growth
it
is
strictly
necessary
to
adopt
it
in
prints
made
by
children
if
present
measurements
are
hereafter
to
be
compared
with
future
ones
the
simplest
plan
of
determining
and
employing
this
unit
is
to
count
the
number
of
ridges
to
the
nearest
within
the
space
of
of
an
inch
measured
along
the
axis
of
the
finger

and
about
the
point
where
it
cuts
the
of
the
outline

having
already
prepared
scales
suitable
for
the
various
likely
numbers
to
make
the
measurements
with
the
appropriate
scale
thus
if
five
ridges
were
crossed
by
the
axis
at
that
part
in
the
space
of
of

each
unit
of
the
scale
to
be
used
would
be
of
an
inch
if
there
were
four
ridges
each
unit
of
the
scale
would
be
of
an
inch
if
six
ridges
and
so
forth
there
is
no
theoretical
or
practical
difficulty
only
rough
indications
being
required
it
is
unnecessary
to
describe
in
detail
how
the
bearings
of
any
point
may
be
expressed
after
the
fashion
of
compass
bearings
the
direction
taking
the
place
of
the
uppermost

the

a

any

our

engaged

the
wonderful
arrangement

curving
of
the
minute
furrows
connected
with
the
organ
of
touch
on
the
inner
surfaces
of
the

especially
on
the
last
phalanx
of
each
finger
some
general
account
of
them
is
always
to
be
found
in
every
manual
of
physiology
and
anatomy
but
in
an
organ
of
such
importance
as
the
human
hand
used
as
it
is
for
very
varied
movements
and
especially
serviceable
to
the
sense
of
touch
no
research
however
minute
can
fail
in
yielding
some
gratifying
addition
to
our
knowledge
of
that
organ
after
numberless
observations
i
have
thus
far
met
with
nine
principal
varieties
of
curvature
according
to
which
the
tactile
furrows
are
disposed
upon
the
inner
surface
of
the
last
phalanx
of
the
fingers
i
will
describe
them
concisely
and
refer
to
the
diagrams
for
further
explanation

the
minute
furrows
starting
from
the
bend
of
the
joint
run
from
one
side
of
the
phalanx
to
the
other
at
first
transversely
in
nearly
straight
lines
then
by
degrees
they
become
more
and
more
curved
towards
the
middle
until
at
last
they
are
bent
into
arches
that
are
almost
concentric
with
the
circumference
of
the
finger
longitudinal
this
configuration
is
nearly
the
same
as
in
the
only
difference
being
that
a
perpendicular
stria
is
enclosed
within
the
transverse
furrows
as
if
it
were
a
nucleus
a
solitary
line
runs
from
one
or
other
of
the
two
sides
of
the
finger
passing
obliquely
between
the
transverse
curves
in
and
ending
near
the
middle
if
this
oblique
line
recurves
towards
the
side
from
which
it
started
and
is
accompanied
by
several
others
all
recurved
in
the
same
way
the
result
is
an
oblique
sinus
more
or
less
upright

horizontal

the
case
may
be
a
junction
at
its
base
of
minute
lines
proceeding
from
either
of
its
sides

a
triangle
this
distribution
of
the
furrows
in
which
an
oblique
sinus
is
found
is
by
far
the
most
common
and
it
may
be
considered
as
a
special
characteristic
of
man
the
furrows
that
are
packed
in
longitudinal
rows
are
on
the
other
hand
peculiar
to

the
vertex
of
the
oblique
sinus
is
generally
inclined
towards
the
radial
side
of
the
hand

it
must
be
observed
that
the
contrary
is
more
frequently
the
case
in
the

vertex
there
tending
towards
the
ulnar
side
scarcely
any
other
configuration
is
to
be

of
the

persistence
the
evidence
that
the
minutiæ
persist
throughout
life
is
derived
from
the
scrutiny

duplicate
impressions

of
each
pair
having
been
made
many
years
ago
the
other
recently
those
which
i
have
studied
more
or
less
exhaustively
are
derived
from
the
digits
of
fifteen
different
persons
in
some
cases
repeated
impressions
of
one
finger
only
were
available
in
most
cases

of
an
entire

the
whole

different

almost
all
these
valuable

without
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
carry

curiosity
took

distinct
finger
print
even
though
it
be
only
a
dabbed
impression
contains
on
a
rough
average
different
points
of
reference
in
addition
to
its
general
peculiarities
of
outline
and
core
they
consist
of
forkings
beginnings
or
ends
of
ridges
islands
and
enclosures
these
minute
details
are
by
no
means
peculiar
to
the
pattern
itself
but
are
distributed
with
almost
equal
abundance
throughout
the
whole
palmar
surface
in
order
to
make
an
exhaustive
comparison
of
two
impressions
they
ought
to
be
photographically
enlarged
to
a
size
not
smaller
than
those
shown
in
plate
two
negatives
of
impressions
can
thus
be
taken
side
by
side
on
an
ordinary
and
any
number
of
photographic
prints
made
from
them
but
for
still
more
comfortable
working
a
further
enlargement
is
desirable
say
by
the
prism
some
of
the
prints
may
be
made
on
paper
as
already
mentioned
pp
they
are
more
convenient
by
far
than
prints
made
by
the
silver
or
by
the
platinum
process
having
placed
the
enlarged
prints
side
by
side
two
or
three
conspicuous
and
convenient
points
of
reference
whether
islands
enclosures
or
particularly
distinct
bifurcations
should
be
identified
and
marked
by
their
help
the
position
of
the
prints
should
be
readjusted
so
that
they
shall
be
oriented
exactly
alike
from
each
point
of
reference
in
succession
the
spines
of
the
ridges
are
then
to
be
followed
with
a
fine
pencil
in
the
two
prints
alternately
neatly
marking
each
new
point
of
comparison
with
a
numeral
in
coloured
ink
plate
when
both
of
the
prints
are
good
and
clear
this
is
rapidly
done
wherever
the
impressions
are
faulty
there
may
be
many
ambiguities
requiring
patience
to
unravel
at
first
i
was
timid
and
proceeded
too
hesitatingly
when
one
of
the
impressions
was
indistinct
making
short
alternate
traces
afterwards
on
gaining
confidence
i
traced
boldly
starting
from
any
point
of
reference
and
not
stopping
until
there
were
reasonable
grounds
for
hesitation
and
found
it
easy
in
this
way
to
trace
the
unions
between
opposite
and
incompletely
printed
ends
of
ridges
and
to
disentangle
many
bad
impressions
an
exact
correspondence
between
the
of
two
minutiæ
is
of
secondary
importance
thus
the
commonest
point
of
reference
is
a
bifurcation
now
the
neck
or
point
of
divergence
of
a
new
ridge
is
apt
to
be
a
little
low
and
sometimes
fails
to
take
the
ink
hence
a
new
ridge
may
appear
in
one
of
the
prints
to
have
an
independent
origin
and
in
the
other
to
be
a
branch
the
origin
is
therefore
of
little
importance
the
main
fact
to
be
attended
to
is
that
a
new
ridge
comes
into
existence
at
a
particular
point
it
came
into
existence
is
a
secondary
matter
similarly
an
apparently
broken
ridge
may
in
reality
be
due
to
an
imperfectly
printed
enclosure
and
an
island
in
one
print
may
appear
as
part
of
an
enclosure
in
the
other
moreover
this
variation
in
details
may
be
the
effect
not
only
of
imperfect
inking
or
printing
but
of
disintegration
due
to
old
age
which
renders
the
impressions
of
the
ridges
ragged
and
broken
as
in
my
own
finger
prints
on
the
plate
fig
explains
the
nature
of
the
apparent
discrepancies
better
than
a
verbal
description
in
a
new
ridge
appears
to
be
suddenly
intruded
between
two
adjacent
ones
which
have
separated
to
make
room
for
it
but
a
second
print
taken
from
the
same
finger
may
have
the
appearance
of
either
or
showing
that
the
new
ridge
is
in
reality
a
fork
of
one
or
other
of
them
the
low
connecting
neck
having
failed
to
leave
an
impression
the
second
line
of
examples
shows
how
an
enclosure
which
is
clearly
defined
in
may
give
rise
to
the
appearance
of
broken
continuity
shown
in
and
how
a
distinct
island
in
one
of
the
prints
may
be
the
remnant
of
an
enclosure
which
is
shown
in
the
other
these
remarks
are
offered
as
a
caution
against
attaching
undue
importance
to
disaccord
in
the
details
of
the
minutiæ
that
are
found
in
the
same
place
in
different
prints
usually
however
the
distinction
between
a
fork
and
the
beginning
of
a
new
ridge
is
clear
enough
the
islands
and
enclosures
are
also
mostly
well
marked

the

experience
unique

must
be
the

about

another
set
that
of

is
clearly
expressed
by

there

one
of

together
almost
wholly
cover
the
ordinary
life
of
man
we
are
justified
in
inferring
that
between
birth
and
death
there
is
absolutely
no
change
in
say
out
of
of
the
numerous
characteristics
in
the
markings
of
the
fingers
of
the
same
person
such
as
can
be
impressed
by
them
whenever
it
is
desirable
to
do
so
neither
can
there
be
any
change
after
death
up
to
the
time
when
the
skin
perishes
through
decomposition

example
the
marks
on
the
fingers
of
many
egyptian
mummies
and
on
the
paws
of
stuffed
monkeys
still
remain
legible
very
good
evidence
and
careful
inquiry
is
thus
seen
to
justify
the
popular
idea
of
the
persistence
of
finger
markings
that
has
hitherto
been
too
rashly
jumped
at
and
which
wrongly
ascribed
the
persistence
to
the
general
appearance
of
the
pattern
rather
than
to
the
minutiæ
it
contains
there
appear
to
be
no
external
bodily
characteristics
other
than
deep
scars
and
tattoo
marks
comparable
in
their
persistence
to
these
markings
whether
they
be
on
the
finger
on
other
parts
of
the
palmar
surface
of
the
hand
or
on
the
sole
of
the
foot
at
the
same
time
they
are
out
of
all
proportion
more
numerous
than
any
other
measurable
features
about
of
them
are
situated
on
the
bulb
of
each
of
the
ten
digits
in
addition
to
more
than
on
the
ball
of
the
thumb
which
has
not
of
the
superficies
of
the
rest
of
the
palmar
surface
the
total
number
of
points
suitable
for
comparison
on
the
two
hands
must
therefore
be
not
less
than
one
thousand
and
nearer
to
two
an
estimate
which
i
verified
by
a
rough
count
on
my
own
hand
similarly
in
respect
to
the
feet
the
dimensions
of
the
limbs
and
body
alter
in
the
course
of
growth
and
decay
the
colour
quantity
and
quality
of
the
hair
the
tint
and
quality
of
the
skin
the
number
and
set
of
the
teeth
the
expression
of
the
features
the
gestures
the
handwriting
even
the
change
after
many
years
there
seems
no
persistence
in
the
visible
parts
of
the
body
except
in
these
minute
and
hitherto
too
much
disregarded
ridges
it
must
be
emphasised
that
it
is
in
the
minutiæ
and
in
the
measured
dimensions
of
any
portion
of
the
pattern
that
this
remarkable
persistence
is
observed
not
even
if
the
measurements
be
made
in
units
of
a
the
pattern
grows
simultaneously
with
the
finger
and
its
proportions
vary
with
its
fatness
leanness
usage
gouty
deformation
or
age
but
though
the
pattern
as
a
whole
may
become
considerably
altered
in
length
or
breadth
the
number
of
ridges
their
embranchments
and
other
minutiæ
remain
unchanged
so
it
is
with
the
pattern
on
a
piece
of
lace
the
piece
as
a
whole
may
be
stretched
in
this
way
or
shrunk
in
that
and
its
outline
altogether
altered
nevertheless
every
one
of
the
component
threads
and
every
knot
in
every
thread
can
easily
be
traced
and
identified
in
both
therefore
in
speaking
of
the
persistence
of
the
marks
on
the
finger
the
phrase
must
be
taken
to
apply
principally
to
the
minutiæ
and
to
the
general
character
of
the
pattern
not
to
the
measure
of
its
length
breadth
or
other
diameter
these
being
no
more

the

other

evidential
value
the
object
of
this
chapter
is
to
give
an
approximate
numerical
idea
of
the
value
of
finger
prints
as
a
means
of
personal
identification
though
the
estimates
that
will
be
made
are
professedly
and
obviously
far
below
the
truth
they
are
amply
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
evidence
afforded
by
finger
prints
may
be
trusted
in
a
most
remarkable
degree
our
problem
is
this
given
two
finger
prints
which
are
alike
in
their
minutiæ
what
is
the
chance
that
they
were
made
by
different
persons
the
first
attempt
at
comparing
two
finger
prints
would
be
directed
to
a
rough
general
examination
of
their
respective
patterns
if
they
do
not
agree
in
being
arches
loops
or
whorls
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
prints
are
those
of
different
fingers
neither
can
there
be
doubt
when
they
are
distinct
forms
of
the
same
general
class
but
to
agree
thus
far
goes
only
a
short
way
towards
establishing
identity
for
the
number
of
patterns
that
are
promptly
distinguishable
from
one
another
is
not
large
my
earlier
inquiries
showed
this
when
endeavouring
to
sort
the
prints
of
thumbs
into
groups
that
differed
each
from
the
rest
by
an
equally
discernible
interval
while
the
attempt
as
already
mentioned
was
not
successful
in
its
main
object
it
showed
that
nearly
all
the
collection
could
be
sorted
into
groups
in
each
of
which
the
prints
had
a
fairly
near
resemblance
moreover
twelve
or
fifteen
of
the
groups
referred
to
different
varieties
of
the
loop
and
as
of
all
the
prints
are
loops
of
the
specimens
fell
into
twelve
or
fifteen
groups
the
chance
that
an
unseen
pattern
is
some
particular
variety
of
loop
is
therefore
compounded
of
to
against
its
being
a
loop
at
all
and
of
to
or
as
the
case
may
be
against
its
being
the
specified
kind
of
loop
this
makes
an
adverse
chance
of
only
to
or
to
say
as
to
or
as
to
this
very
rude
calculation
suffices
to
show
that
on
the
average
no
great
reliance
can
be
placed
on
a
general
resemblance
in
the
appearance
of
two
finger
prints
as
a
proof
that
they
were
made
by
the
same
finger
though
the
obvious
disagreement
of
two
prints
is
conclusive
evidence
that
they
were
made
by
different
fingers
when
we
proceed
to
a
much
more
careful
comparison
and
collate
successively
the
numerous
minutiæ
their
coincidence
throughout
would
be
an
evidence
of
identity
whose
value
we
will
now
try
to
appraise
let
us
first
consider
the
question
how
far
may
the
minutiæ
or
groups
of
them
be
treated
as
variables
suppose
that
a
tiny
square
of
paper
of
only
one
average
in
the
side
be
cut
out
and
dropped
at
random
on
a
finger
print
it
will
mask
from
view
a
minute
portion
of
one
or
possibly
of
two
ridges
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
what
was
hidden
could
be
correctly
interpolated
by
simply
joining
the
ends
of
the
ridge
or
ridges
that
were
interrupted
it
is
true
the
paper
might
possibly
have
fallen
exactly
upon
and
hidden
a
minute
island
or
enclosure
and
that
our
reconstruction
would
have
failed
in
consequence
but
such
an
accident
is
improbable
in
a
high
degree
and
may
be
almost
ignored
repeating
the
process
with
a
much
larger
square
of
paper
say
of
twelve
in
the
side
the
improbability
of
correctly
reconstructing
the
masked
portion
will
have
immensely
increased
the
number
of
ridges
that
enter
the
square
on
any
one
side
will
perhaps
as
often
as
not
differ
from
the
number
which
emerge
from
the
opposite
side
and
when
they
are
the
same
it
does
not
at
all
follow
that
they
would
be
continuous
each
to
each
for
in
so
large
a
space
forks
and
junctions
are
sure
to
occur
between
some
and
it
is
impossible
to
know
which
of
the
ridges
consequently
there
must
exist
a
certain
size
of
square
with
more
than
one
and
less
than
twelve
in
the
side
which
will
mask
so
much
of
the
print
that
it
will
be
an
even
chance
whether
the
hidden
portion
can
on
the
average
be
rightly
reconstructed
or
not
the
size
of
that
square
must
now
be
considered
if
the
reader
will
refer
to
plate
in
which
there
are
eight
much
enlarged
photographs
of
portions
of
different
finger
prints
he
will
observe
that
the
length
of
each
of
the
portions
exceeds
the
breadth
in
the
proportion
of
to
consequently
by
drawing
one
line
down
the
middle
and
two
lines
across
each
portion
may
be
divided
into
six
squares
moreover
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
side
of
each
of
these
squares
has
a
length
of
about
six
i
cut
out
squares
of
paper
of
this
size
and
throwing
one
of
them
at
random
on
any
one
of
the
eight
portions
succeeded
almost
as
frequently
as
not
in
drawing
lines
on
its
back
which
comparison
afterwards
showed
to
have
followed
the
true
course
of
the
ridges
the
provisional
estimate
that
a
length
of
six
approximated
to
but
exceeded
that
of
the
side
of
the
desired
square
proved
to
be
correct
by
the
following
more
exact
observations
and
by
three
different
methods
i
the
first
set
of
tests
to
verify
this
estimate
were
made
upon
photographic
enlargements
of
various
thumb
prints
to
double
their
natural
size
a
square
of
paper
was
damped
and
laid
at
random
on
the
print
the
core
of
the
pattern
which
was
too
complex
in
many
cases
to
serve
as
an
average
test
being
alone
avoided
the
prints
being
on
ordinary
albuminised
paper
which
is
slightly
adherent
when
moistened
the
patch
stuck
temporarily
wherever
it
was
placed
and
pressed
down
next
a
sheet
of
which
we
will
call
no
was
laid
over
all
and
the
margin
of
the
square
patch
was
traced
upon
it
together
with
the
course
of
the
surrounding
ridges
up
to
that
margin
then
i
interpolated
on
the
what
seemed
to
be
the
most
likely
course
of
those
ridges
which
were
hidden
by
the
square
no
was
then
removed
and
a
second
sheet
no
was
laid
on
and
the
margin
of
the
patch
was
outlined
on
it
as
before
together
with
the
ridges
leading
up
to
it
next
a
corner
only
of
no
was
raised
the
square
patch
was
whisked
away
from
underneath
the
corner
was
replaced
the
sheet
was
flattened
down
and
the
actual
courses
of
the
ridges
within
the
already
marked
outline
were
traced
in
thus
there
were
two
tracings
of
the
margin
of
the
square
of
which
no
contained
the
ridges
as
i
had
interpolated
them
no
as
they
really
were
and
it
was
easy
to
compare
the
two
the
results
are
given
in
the
first
column
of
the
following
table
interpolation
of
ridges
in
a
square
double
with
prism
scale
with
ii
in
the
second
method
the
were
discarded
and
the
prism
of
a
camera
lucida
used
it
threw
an
image
three
times
the
size
of
the
upon
a
card
and
there
it
was
traced
the
same
general
principle
was
adopted
as
in
the
first
method
but
the
results
being
on
a
larger
scale
and
drawn
on
stout
paper
were
more
satisfactory
and
convenient
they
are
given
in
the
second
column
of
the
table
in
this
and
the
foregoing
methods
two
different
portions
of
the
same
print
were
sometimes
dealt
with
for
it
was
a
little
more
convenient
and
seemed
as
good
a
way
of
obtaining
average
results
as
that
of
always
using
portions
of
different
finger
prints
the
total
number
of
trials
by
one
or
other
of
the
two
methods
were
made
from
about
forty
different
prints
i
am
not
sure
of
the
exact
number
the
results
in
each
of
the
two
methods
were
sometimes
quite
right
sometimes
quite
wrong
sometimes
neither
one
nor
the
other
the
latter
depended
on
the
individual
judgment
as
to
which
class
it
belonged
and
might
be
battled
over
with
more
or
less
show
of
reason
by
advocates
on
opposite
sides
equally
dividing
these
intermediate
cases
between
right
and
wrong
the
results
were
obtained
as
shown
in
one
and
only
one
of
the
cases
the
most
reasonable
interpretation
had
not
been
given
and
the
result
had
been
wrong
when
it
ought
to
have
been
right
the
purely
personal
error
was
therefore
disregarded
and
the
result
entered
as
right
iii
a
third
attempt
was
made
by
a
different
method
upon
the
lineations
of
a
finger
print
drawn
on
about
a
scale
it
had
first
been
enlarged
four
times
by
photography
and
from
this
enlargement
the
axes
of
the
ridges
had
been
drawn
with
a
enlarging
pantagraph
the
aim
now
was
to
reconstruct
the
entire
finger
print
by
two
successive
and
independent
acts
of
interpolation
a
sheet
of
transparent
was
ruled
into
squares
and
every
one
of
its
alternate
squares
was
rendered
opaque
by
pasting
white
paper
upon
it
giving
it
the
appearance
of
a
when
this
was
laid
on
the
print
exactly
one
half
of
the
squares
were
masked
by
the
opaque
squares
while
the
ridges
running
up
to
them
could
be
seen
they
were
not
quite
so
visible
as
if
each
opaque
square
had
been
wholly
detached
from
its
neighbours
instead
of
touching
them
at
the
extreme
corners
still
the
loss
of
information
thereby
occasioned
was
small
and
not
worth
laying
stress
upon
it
is
easily
understood
that
when
the
was
moved
parallel
to
itself
through
the
space
of
one
square
whether
upwards
or
downwards
or
to
the
right
or
left
the
parts
that
were
previously
masked
became
visible
and
those
that
were
visible
became
masked
the
object
was
to
interpolate
the
ridges
in
every
opaque
square
under
one
of
these
conditions
then
to
do
the
same
for
the
remaining
squares
under
the
other
condition
and
finally
by
combining
the
results
to
obtain
a
complete
scheme
of
the
ridges
wholly
by
interpolation
this
was
easily
done
by
using
two
sheets
of
laid
in
succession
over
the
whose
position
on
the
print
had
been
changed
meanwhile
and
afterwards
tracing
the
lineations
that
were
drawn
on
one
of
the
two
sheets
upon
the
vacant
squares
of
the
other
the
results
are
given
in
the
third
column
of
the
table
the
three
methods
give
roughly
similar
results
and
we
may
therefore
accept
the
ratios
of
their
totals
which
is
to
or
say
to
as
representing
the
chance
that
the
reconstruction
of
any
square
would
be
correct
under
the
given
conditions
on
reckoning
the
chance
as
to
which
will
be
done
at
first
it
is
obvious
that
the
error
whatever
it
may
be
is
on
the
safe
side
a
closer
equality
in
the
chance
that
the
ridges
in
a
square
might
run
in
the
observed
way
or
in
some
other
way
would
result
from
taking
a
square
of
five
in
the
side
i
believe
this
to
be
very
closely
the
right
size
a
square
is
certainly
too
small
when
the
reconstructed
squares
were
wrong
they
had
none
the
less
a
natural
appearance
this
was
especially
seen
and
on
a
large
scale
in
the
result
of
the
method
by
in
which
the
lineations
of
an
entire
print
were
constructed
by
guess
being
so
familiar
with
the
run
of
these
ridges
in
finger
prints
i
can
speak
with
confidence
on
this
my
assumption
is
that
any
one
of
these
reconstructions
represents
lineations
that
might
have
occurred
in
nature
in
association
with
the
conditions
outside
the
square
just
as
well
as
the
lineations
of
the
actual
finger
print
the
courses
of
the
ridges
in
each
square
are
subject
to
uncertainties
due
to
petty
incidents
to
which
the
conditions
outside
the
square
give
no
sure
indication
they
appear
to
be
in
great
part
determined
by
the
particular
disposition
of
each
one
or
more
of
the
half
hundred
or
so
which
the
square
contains
the
ridges
rarely
run
in
evenly
flowing
lines
but
may
be
compared
to
footways
across
a
broken
country
which
while
they
follow
a
general
direction
are
continually
deflected
by
such
trifles
as
a
tuft
of
grass
a
stone
or
a
puddle
even
if
the
number
of
ridges
emerging
from
a
square
equals
the
number
of
those
which
enter
it
does
not
follow
that
they
run
across
in
parallel
lines
for
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
any
one
of
the
ridges
to
end
and
another
to
bifurcate
it
is
impossible
therefore
to
know
beforehand
in
which
if
in
any
of
the
ridges
these
peculiarities
will
be
found
when
the
number
of
entering
and
issuing
ridges
is
unequal
the
difficulty
is
increased
there
may
moreover
be
islands
or
enclosures
in
any
particular
part
of
the
square
it
therefore
seems
right
to
look
upon
the
squares
as
independent
variables
in
the
sense
that
when
the
surrounding
conditions
are
alone
taken
into
account
the
ridges
within
their
limits
may
either
run
in
the
observed
way
or
in
a
different
way
the
chance
of
these
two
contrasted
events
being
taken
for
safety
sake
as
approximately
equal
in
comparing
finger
prints
which
are
alike
in
their
general
pattern
it
may
well
happen
that
the
proportions
of
the
patterns
differ
one
may
be
that
of
a
slender
boy
the
other
that
of
a
man
whose
fingers
have
been
broadened
or
deformed
by
it
is
therefore
requisite
to
imagine
that
only
one
of
the
prints
is
divided
into
exact
squares
and
to
suppose
that
a
reticulation
has
been
drawn
over
the
other
in
which
each
mesh
included
the
corresponding
parts
of
the
former
print
frequent
trials
have
shown
that
there
is
no
practical
difficulty
in
actually
doing
this
and
it
is
the
only
way
of
making
a
fair
comparison
between
the
two
these
squares
may
thus
be
regarded
as
independent
units
each
of
which
is
equally
liable
to
fall
into
one
or
other
of
two
alternative
classes
when
the
surrounding
conditions
are
alone
known
the
inevitable
consequence
from
this
datum
is
that
the
chance
of
an
exact
correspondence
between
two
different
finger
prints
in
each
of
the
squares
into
which
they
may
be
divided
and
which
are
about
in
number
is
at
least
as
to
multiplied
into
itself
times
usually
written
that
is
as
to
about
ten
thousand
millions
but
we
must
not
forget
that
the
square
was
taken
in
order
to
ensure
a
square
would
have
been
preferable
so
the
adverse
chances
would
in
reality
be
enormously
greater
still
it
is
hateful
to
blunder
in
calculations
of
adverse
chances
by
overlooking
correlations
between
variables
and
to
falsely
assume
them
independent
with
the
result
that
inflated
estimates
are
made
which
require
to
be
proportionately
reduced
here
however
there
seems
to
be
little
room
for
such
an
error
we
must
next
combine
the
above
enormously
unfavourable
chance
which
we
will
call
with
the
other
chances
of
not
guessing
correctly
beforehand
the
surrounding
conditions
under
which
was
calculated
these
latter
are
divisible
into
and
the
chance
is
that
of
not
guessing
correctly
the
general
course
of
the
ridges
adjacent
to
each
square
and
that
of
not
guessing
rightly
the
number
of
ridges
that
enter
and
issue
from
the
square
the
chance
has
already
been
discussed
with
the
result
that
it
might
be
taken
as
to
for
of
all
the
patterns
it
would
be
higher
for
the
remainder
and
very
high
indeed
for
some
few
of
them
but
as
it
is
advisable
always
to
underestimate
it
may
be
taken
as
to
or
to
obtain
the
convenience
of
dealing
only
with
values
of
multiplied
into
itself
the
still
lower
ratio
of
to
that
is
as
to
as
to
the
remaining
chance
with
which
and
have
to
be
compounded
namely
that
of
guessing
aright
the
number
of
ridges
that
enter
and
leave
each
side
of
a
particular
square
i
can
offer
no
careful
observations
the
number
of
the
ridges
would
for
the
most
part
vary
between
five
and
seven
and
those
in
the
different
squares
are
certainly
not
quite
independent
of
one
another
we
have
already
arrived
at
such
large
figures
that
it
is
surplusage
to
heap
up
more
of
them
therefore
let
us
say
as
a
mere
nominal
sum
much
below
the
real
figure
that
the
chance
against
guessing
each
and
every
one
of
these
data
correctly
is
as
to
or
say
to
the
result
is
that
the
chance
of
lineations
constructed
by
the
imagination
according
to
strictly
natural
forms
which
shall
be
found
to
resemble
those
of
a
single
finger
print
in
all
their
minutiæ
is
less
than
to
or
to
or
to
about
thousand
millions
the
inference
is
that
as
the
number
of
the
human
race
is
reckoned
at
about
sixteen
thousand
millions
it
is
a
smaller
chance
than
to
that
the
print
of
a
finger
of
any
given
person
would
be
exactly
like
that
of
the
same
finger
of
any
other
member
of
the
human
race
when
two
fingers
of
each
of
the
two
persons
are
compared
and
found
to
have
the
same
minutiæ
the
improbability
of
to
becomes
squared
and
reaches
a
figure
altogether
beyond
the
range
of
the
imagination
when
three
fingers
it
is
cubed
and
so
on
a
single
instance
has
shown
that
the
minutiæ
are
invariably
permanent
throughout
life
but
that
one
or
more
of
them
may
possibly
change
they
may
also
be
destroyed
by
wounds
and
more
or
less
disintegrated
by
hard
work
disease
or
age
ambiguities
will
thus
arise
in
their
interpretation
one
person
asserting
a
resemblance
in
respect
to
a
particular
feature
while
another
asserts
dissimilarity
it
is
therefore
of
interest
to
know
how
far
a
conceded
resemblance
in
the
great
majority
of
the
minutiæ
combined
with
some
doubt
as
to
the
remainder
will
tell
in
favour
of
identity
it
will
now
be
convenient
to
change
our
datum
from
a
to
a
square
of
which
about
are
contained
in
a
single
print
or
being
much
the
same
as
or
the
reason
for
the
change
is
that
this
number
of
happens
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
minutiæ
we
shall
therefore
not
be
acting
unfairly
if
with
reservation
and
for
the
sake
of
obtaining
some
result
however
rough
we
consider
the
minutiæ
themselves
as
so
many
independent
variables
and
accept
the
chance
now
as
to
this
has
to
be
multiplied
as
before
into
the
factor
of
which
may
still
be
considered
appropriate
though
it
is
too
small
making
the
total
of
adverse
chances
to
upon
such
a
basis
the
calculation
is
simple
there
would
on
the
average
be
instances
out
of
the
total
combinations
of
similarity
in
all
but
one
particular
in
all
but
two
in
all
but
three
and
so
on
according
to
the
binomial
expansion
taking
for
convenience
the
powers
of
to
which
these
values
approximate
or
rather
with
the
view
of
not
overestimating
let
us
take
the
power
of
that
falls
short
of
each
of
them
these
may
be
reckoned
as
respectively
equal

hence
the
roughly
approximate
chances
of
resemblance
in
all
particulars
are
as
to
in
all
particulars
but

or
to
in
all
but

but

as
to
even
is
so
large
as
to
require
a
row
of
nine
figures
to
express
it
hence
a
few
instances
of
dissimilarity
in
the
two
prints
of
a
single
finger
still
leave
untouched
an
enormously
large
residue
of
evidence
in
favour
of
identity
and
when
two
three
or
more
fingers
in
the
two
persons
agree
to
that
extent
the
strength
of
the
evidence
rises
by
squares
cubes
far
above
the
level
of
that
amount
of
probability
which
begins
to
rank
as
certainty
whatever
reductions
a
legitimate
criticism
may
make
in
the
numerical
results
arrived
at
in
this
chapter
bearing
in
mind
the
occasional
ambiguities
pictured
in
fig
the
broad
fact
remains
that
a
complete
or
nearly
complete
accordance
between
two
prints
of
a
single
finger
and
vastly
more
so
between
the
prints
of
two
or
more
fingers
affords
evidence
requiring
no
corroboration
that
the
persons
from
whom
they
were
made
are
the
same
let
it
also
be
remembered
that
this
evidence
is
applicable
not
only
to
adults
but
can
establish
the
identity
of
the
same
person
at
any
stage
of
his
life
between
babyhood
and
old
age
and
for
some
time
after
his
death
we
read
of
the
dead
body
of
jezebel
being
devoured
by
the
dogs
of
jezreel
so
that
no
man
might
say
this
is
jezebel
and
that
the
dogs
left
only
her
skull
the
palms
of
her
hands
and
the
soles
of
her
feet
but
the
palms
of
the
hands
and
the
soles
of
the
feet
are
the
very
remains
by
which
a
corpse
might
be
most
surely
identified
if
impressions
of
them
made
during
life
were
available
chapter
viii
peculiarities
of
the
digits
the
data
used
in
this
chapter
are
the
prints
of
different
digits
namely
the
ten
digits
of
different
persons
each
digit
can
thus
be
treated
both
separately
and
in
combination
in
cases
five
hundred
can
not
be
called
a
large
number
but
it
suffices
for
approximate
results
the
percentages
that
it
yields
may
for
instance
be
expected
to
be
trustworthy
more
often
than
not
within
two
units
when
preparing
the
tables
for
this
chapter
i
gave
a
more
liberal
interpretation
to
the
word
arch
than
subsequently
at
first
every
pattern
between
a
and
a
plate
was
rated
as
an
arch
afterwards
they
were
rated
as
loops
the
relative
frequency
of
the
three
several
classes
in
the
digits
was
as
follows
arches
per
cent
loops
whorls
total
from
this
it
appears
that
on
the
average
out
of
every
or
digits
one
has
an
arch
out
of
every
digits
two
have
loops
out
of
every
digits
one
has
a
whorl
this
coarse
statistical
treatment
leaves
an
inadequate
impression
each
digit
and
each
hand
having
its
own
peculiarity
as
we
shall
see
in
the
following
table

the

the
statistics
of

be
separated
and
not
massed

the
patterns
distributed
in
the
same
way
upon
the
corresponding
digits
of
the
two
hands
the
answer
from
the
last
table
is
distinct
and
curious
and
will
be
best
appreciated
on
rearranging
the

the
other
including
the

and
as
regards
the
first
group
the
frequency
with
which
any
pattern
occurs
in
any
named
digit
is
statistically
the
same
whether
that
digit
be
on
the
right
or
on
the
left
hand
as
regards
the
second
group
the
frequency
differs
greatly
in
the
two
hands
but
though
in
the
first
group
the
two
the
two
middle
and
the
two
little
fingers
of
the
right
hand
are
severally
circumstanced
alike
in
the
frequency
with
which
their
various
patterns
occur
the
difference
between
the
frequency
of
the
patterns
on
a
fore
a
middle
and
a
little
finger
respectively
is
very
great
in
the
second
group
though
the
thumbs
on
opposite
hands
do
not
resemble
each
other
in
the
statistical
frequency
of
the
patterns
nor
do
the
there
is
a
great
resemblance
between
the
respective
frequencies
in
the
thumbs
and
for
instance
the
whorls
on
either
of
these
fingers
on
the
left
hand
are
only
as
common
as
those
on
the
right
the
figures
in
each
line
and
in
each
column
are
consistent
throughout
in
expressing
these
curious
differences
which
must
therefore
be
accepted
as
facts
and
not
as
statistical
accidents
whatever
may
be
their
explanation
one
of
the
most
noticeable
peculiarities
in
table
is
the
much
greater
frequency
of
arches
on
the
than
on
any
other
of
the
four
digits
it
amounts
to
per
cent
on
the
while
on
the
thumbs
and
on
the
remaining
fingers
the

diminishes

side
of

be

the

the
more
rare

in

the

as
frequently

subdivisions

corroborate
the
strong
statistical
similarity
that
was
observed
to
exist
between
the
frequency
of
the
several
patterns
on
the
right
and
left
a
condition
which
was
also
found
to
characterise
the
middle

little
fingers

is
strange
that
purkenje
considers
the
inner
slope
on
the

be
more
frequent

the

my
nomenclature
differs
from
his
but
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
the
disagreement
in
meaning
the
facts
to
be
adduced
hereafter
make
it
most
improbable
that
the
persons
observed
were
racially
unlike
in
this
particular
the
tendencies
of
digits
to
resemble
one
another
will
now
be
considered
in
their
various
combinations
they
will
be
taken
two
at
a
time
in
order
to
learn
the
frequency
with
which
both
members
of
the
various
couplets
are
affected
by
the
same
class
of
pattern
every
combination
will
be
discussed
except
those
into
which
the
little
finger
enters
these
are
omitted
because
the
overwhelming
frequency
of
loops
in
the
little
fingers
would
make
the
results
of
comparatively
little
interest
while
their
insertion
would
greatly
increase
the
size
of
the

are

the

the

in

is
so
curiously
close
as
to
have
excited
grave
suspicion
that
it
was
due
to
some
absurd
blunder
by
which
the
same
figures
were
made
inadvertently
to
do
duty
twice
over
but
subsequent
checking
disclosed
no
error
though
the
unanimity
of
the
results
is
wonderful
they
are
fairly
arrived
at
and
leave
no
doubt
that
the
relationship
of
any
one
particular
digit
whether
thumb
fore
middle
ring
or
little
finger
to
any
other
particular
digit
is
the
same
whether
the
two
digits
are
on
the
same
or
on
opposite
hands
it
would
be
a
most
interesting
subject
of
statistical
inquiry
to
ascertain
whether
the
distribution
of
malformations
or
of
the
various
forms
of
skin
disease
among
the
digits
corroborates
this
unexpected
and
remarkable
result
i
am
sorry
to
have
no
means
of
undertaking
it
being
assured
on
good
authority
that
no
adequate
collection
of
the
necessary
data
has
yet
been
published
it
might
be
hastily
inferred
from
the
statistical
identity
of
the
connection
between
say
the
right
thumb
and
each
of
the
two
that
the
patterns
on
the
two
ought
always
to
be
alike
whether
arch
loop
or
whorl
if
x
it
may
be
said
is
identical
both
with
y
and
with
z
then
y
and
z
must
be
identical
with
one
another
but
the
statement
of
the
problem
is
wrong
x
is
not
identical
with
y
and
z
but
only
bears
an
identical
amount
of
statistical
resemblance
to
each
of
them
so
this
reasoning
is
inadmissible
the
character
of
the
pattern
on
any
digit
is
determined
by
causes
of
whose
precise
nature
we
are
ignorant
but
we
may
rest
assured
that
they
are
numerous
and
variable
and
that
their
variations
are
in
large
part
independent
of
one
another
we
can
in
imagination
divide
them
into
groups
calling
those
that
are
common
to
the
thumb
and
the
of
either
hand
and
to
those
couplets
exclusively
the
a
causes
those
that
are
common
to
the
two
thumbs
and
to
these
exclusively
the
b
causes
and
similarly
those
common
to
the
two
exclusively
the
c
causes
then
the
sum
of
the
variable
causes
determining
the
class
of
pattern
in
the
four
several
digits
now
in
question
are
these

a
b
an
unclassed
residue
called
x

a
b
x
right
a
c
z
left
a
c
z
the
nearness
of
relationship
between
the
two
thumbs
is
sufficiently
indicated
by
a
fraction
that
expresses
the
proportion
between
all
the
causes
common
to
the
two
thumbs
exclusively
and
the
totality
of
the
causes
by
which
the
class
of
the
patterns
of
the
thumbs
is
determined
that
is
to
say
by
a

between

the
fractions
and
being
both
greater
than
it
follows
that
the
relationships
between
the
two
thumbs
or
between
the
two
are
closer
than
that
between
the
thumb
and
either
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
that
neither
of
the
two
former
relationships
is
so
close
as
to
reach
identity
similarly
as
regards
the
other
couplets
of
digits
the
tabular
entries
fully
confirm
this
deduction
for
without
going
now
into
further
details
it
will
be
seen
from
the
mean
of
the
totals
at
the
bottom
line
of
table
that
the
average
percentage
of
cases
in
which
two
different
digits
have
the
same
class
of
patterns
whether
they
be
on
the
same
or
on
opposite
hands
is
or
say
while
the
average
percentage
of
cases
in
which
right
and
left
digits
bearing
the
same
name
have
the
same
class
of
pattern
table
is
this
is
barely
of
the
which
would
imply
identity
at
the
same
time
the
considerably
exceeds
the
let
us
now
endeavour
to
measure
the
relationships
between
the
various
couplets
of
digits
on
a
centesimal
scale
first
recalling
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
connection
that
subsists
between
relationships
of
all
kinds
whether
between
digits
or
between
kinsmen
or
between
any
of
those
numerous
varieties
of
related
events
with
which
statisticians
deal
relationships
are
all
due
to
the
joint
action
of
two
groups
of
variable
causes
the
one
common
to
both
of
the
related
objects
the
other
special
to
each
as
in
the
case
just
discussed
using
an
analogous
nomenclature
to
that
already
employed
the
peculiarity
of
one
of
the
two
objects
is
due
to
an
aggregate
of
variable
causes
that
we
may
call
and
that
of
the
other
to
in
which
c
are
the
causes
common
to
both
and
x
and
z
the
special
ones
in
exact
proportion
as
x
and
z
diminish
and
c
becomes
of
overpowering
effect
so
does
the
closeness
of
the
relationship
increase
when
x
and
z
both
disappear
the
result
is
identity
of
character
on
the
other
hand
when
c
disappears
all
relationship
ceases
and
the
variations
of
the
two
objects
are
strictly
independent
the
simplest
case
is
that
in
which
x
and
z
are
equal
and
it
becomes
easy
to
devise
a
scale
in
which
shall
stand
for
no
relationship
and
for
identity
and
upon
which
the
intermediate
degrees
of
relationship
may
be
marked
at
their
proper
value
upon
this
assumption
but
with
some
misgiving
i
will
attempt
to
subject
the
digits
to
this
form
of
measurement
it
will
save
time
first
to
work
out
an
example
and
then
after
gaining
in
that
way
a
clearer
understanding
of
what
the
process
is
to
discuss
its
defects
let
us
select
for
our
example
the
case
that
brings
out
these
defects
in
the
most
conspicuous
manner
as
follows
table
tells
us
that
the
percentage
of
whorls
in
the
right
is
and
in
the
left
table
tells
us
that
the
percentage
of
the
double
event
of
a
whorl
occurring
on
both
the
of
the
same
person
is
it
is
required
to
express
the
relationship
between
the
right
and
left
on
a
centesimal
scale
in
which
shall
stand
for
no
relationship
at
all
and
for
the
closest
possible
relationship
if
no
relationship
should
exist
there
would
nevertheless
be
a
certain
percentage
of
instances
due
to
pure
chance
of
the
double
event
of
whorls
occurring
in
both
and
it
is
easy
to
calculate
their
frequency
from
the
above
data
the
number
of
possible
combinations
of
right
with
left
ones
is
and
of
these
would
be
double
events
as
above
call
these
for
brevity
double
whorls
consequently
the
chance
of
a
double
whorl
in
any
single
couplet
is
and
their
average
frequency
in
couplets
in
other
words
their
average
percentage
is
say
if
then
the
observed
percentage
of
double
whorls
should
be
only
it
would
be
a
proof
that
the
classes
of
patterns
on
the
right
and
left
were
quite
independent
so
their
relationship
as
expressed
on
the
centesimal
scale
would
be
there
could
never
be
less
than
double
whorls
under
the
given
conditions
except
through
some
statistical
irregularity
now
consider
the
opposite
extreme
of
the
closest
possible
relationship
subject
however
and
this
is
the
weak
point
to
the
paramount
condition
that
the
average
frequencies
of
the
classes
may
be
taken
as
as
there
are
per
cent
of
whorls
on
the
right
and
only
on
the
left
the
tendency
to
form
double
whorls
however
stringent
it
may
be
can
only
be
satisfied
in
cases
there
remains
a
superfluity
of
per
cent
cases
in
the
right
which
perforce
must
have
for
their
partners
either
arches
or
loops
hence
the
percentage
of
frequency
that
indicates
the
closest
feasible
relationship
under
the
conditions
would
be
the
range
of
all
possible
relationships
in
respect
to
whorls
would
consequently
lie
between
a
percentage
frequency
of
the
minimum
and
the
maximum
while
the
observed
frequency
is
of
the
intermediate
value
of
subtracting
the
from
these
three
values
we
have
the
series
of
these
terms
can
be
converted
into
their
equivalents
in
a
centesimal
scale
that
reaches
from
to
instead
of
from
to
by
the
ordinary
rule
of
three
or
whence
the
value
of
the
observed
relationship
on
the
centesimal
scale
would
be
or
neglecting
decimals
this
method
of
obtaining
the
value
of
is
open
to
grave
objection
in
the
present
example
we
have
no
right
to
consider
that
the
per
cent
of
whorls
on
the
right
and
the
on
the
left
can
be
due
to
conditions
which
would
exercise
a
paramount
effect
even
though
the
whorls
were
due
entirely
to
causes
common
to
both
fingers
there
is
some
in
such
a
supposition
neither
are
we
at
liberty
to
assume
that
the
respective
effects
of
the
special
causes
x
and
z
are
equal
in
average
amount
if
they
were
the
percentage
of
whorls
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
finger
would
invariably
be
equal
in
this
particular
example
the
difficulty
of
determining
correctly
the
scale
value
of
is
exceptionally
great
elsewhere
the
percentages
of
frequency
in
the
two
members
of
each
couplet
are
more
alike
in
the
two
and
again
in
the
two
middle
fingers
they
are
closely
alike
therefore
in
these
latter
cases
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
pass
over
the
objection
that
x
and
z
have
not
been
proved
to
be
equal
but
we
must
accept
the
results
in
all
other
cases
with
great
caution
when
the
digits
are
of
different
names
as
the
thumb
and
the
whether
the
digits
be
on
the
same
or
on
opposite
hands
there
are
two
cases
to
be
worked
out
namely
such
as
right
thumb
and
left
and
left
thumb
and
right
each
accounts
for
per
cent
of
the
observed
cases
therefore
the
mean
of
the
two
percentages
is
the
correct
percentage
the
relationships
calculated
in
the
following
table
do
not
include
arches
except
in
two
instances
mentioned
in
a
subsequent
paragraph
as
the
arches
are
elsewhere
too
rare
to
furnish
useful
results
it
did
not
seem
necessary
to
repeat
the
calculation
for
couplets
of
digits
of
different
names
situated
on
opposite
hands
as
those
that
were
calculated
on
closely
the
same
data
for
similar
couplets
situated
on
the
same
hands
suffice
for
both
it
is
evident
from
the
irregularity
in
the
run
of
the
figures
that
the
units
in
the
several
entries
can
not
be
more
than
vaguely
approximate
they
have
however
been
retained
as
being
possibly
better

nearer

also

couplets
of

bearing
different
names
the
relationship
is
closest
between
the
middle
finger
and
the
two
adjacent
ones

as
against

it
is
further
seen
in
every
pair
of
entries
that
whorls
are
related
together
more
closely
than
loops
i
note
this
but
can
not
explain
it
so
far
as
my
statistical
inquiries
into
heredity
have
hitherto
gone
all
peculiarities
were
found
to
follow
the
same
law
of
transmission
none
being
more
surely
inherited
than
others
if
there
were
a
tendency
in
any
one
out
of
many
alternative
characters
to
be
more
heritable
than
the
rest
that
character
would
become
universally
prevalent
in
the
absence
of
restraining
influences
but
it
does
not
follow
that
there
are
no
peculiar
restraining
influences
here
nor
that
what
is
true
for
heredity
should
be
true
in
all
its
details

regards
the
relationships
between
the
different

methods
of
indexing
in
this
chapter
the
system
of
classification
by
arches
loops
and
whorls
described
in
chapter
will
be
used
for
indexing
two
three
six
or
ten
digits
as
the
case
may
be
an
index
to
each
set
of
finger
marks
made
by
the
same
person
is
needful
in
almost
every
kind
of
inquiry
whether
it
be
for
descriptive
purposes
for
investigations
into
race
and
heredity
or
into
questions
of
symmetry
and
correlation
it
is
essential
to
possess
an
index
to
the
finger
marks
of
known
criminals
before
the
method
of
finger
prints
can
be
utilised
as
an
organised
means
of
detection
the
ideal
index
might
be
conceived
to
consist
of
a
considerable
number
of
compartments
or
their
equivalents
each
bearing
a
different
into
which
the
sets
of
finger
prints
of
different
persons
may
be
severally
sorted
so
that
all
similar
sets
shall
lie
in
the
same
compartment
the
principle
of
the
proposed
method
of
is
that
they
should
depend
upon
a
few
conspicuous
differences
of
pattern
in
many
fingers
and
not
upon
many
minute
differences
in
a
few
fingers
it
is
carried
into
effect
by
distinguishing
the
class
of
pattern
on
each
digit
in
succession
by
a
letter
for
arch
for
loop
for
whorl
or
else
as
an
alternative
method
to
subdivide
by
using
for
a
loop
with
an
inner
slope
and
for
one
with
an
outer
slope
as
the
case
may
be
in
this
way
the
class
of
pattern
in
each
set
of
ten
digits
is
described
by
a
sequence
of
ten
letters
the
various
combinations
of
which
are
alphabetically
arranged
and
form
the
different
let
us
now
discuss
the
best
method
of
carrying
out
this
principle
by
collating
the
results
of
alternative
methods
of
applying
it
we
have
to
consider
the
utility
of
the
and
as
compared
to
the
simple
and
the
gain
through
taking
all
ten
digits
into
account
instead
of
only
some
of
them
it
will
be
instructive
to
print
here
an
actual
index
to
the
finger
prints
of
different
persons
who
were
not
in
any
way
selected
but
taken
as
they
came
and
to
use
it
as
the
basis
of
a
considerable
portion
of
the
following
remarks
to
be
checked
where
necessary
by
results
derived
from
an
index
to
cases
in
which
these
hundred
are
included
this
index
is

a

to

shows
the

of

in
the
three
alternative
methods
of
noting
slopes
of
all
kinds
in
all

of
noting
slopes
of
loops
only
and
in
the

and
of
disregarding

to
the
method
first
used
with
success
and
described
in
my
memoir
already
alluded
to
roy
accompanied
by
a
specimen
index
from
which
the
present
one
was
derived
there
the
direction
of
the
slope
of
every
pattern
that
has
one
is
taken
into
account
and
in
order
to
give
as
much
scope
as
possible
to
the
method
the
term
arch
i
then
called
it
a
primary
was
construed
somewhat
see
it
was
made
to
include
the
fig
and
even
the
so
long
as
not
more
than
a
single
recurved
ridge
lay
within
the
outline
of
the
pattern
therefore
many
of
the
arches
had
slopes
it
is
not
necessary
to
trouble
the
reader
with
the
numerical
nomenclature
that
was
then
used
the
method
itself
being
now
obsolete
full
particulars
of
it
are
however
given
in
the
memoir
a
somewhat
large
experience
in
sorting
finger
prints
in
various
ways
and
repeatedly
made
it
only
too
evident
that
the
mental
strain
and
risk
of
error
caused
by
taking
all
slopes
into
account
was
considerable
the
judgment
became
fatigued
and
the
eye
puzzled
by
having
to
assign
opposite
meanings
to
the
same
actual
direction
of
a
slope
in
the
right
and
left
hands
respectively
there
was
also
a
frequent
doubt
as
to
the
existence
of
a
slope
in
large
whorls
of
the
and
patterns
fig
when
the
impressions
had
not
been
rolled
a
third
objection
is
the
rarity
of
the
inner
slopes
in
any
other
digit
than
the
it
acted
like
a
soporific
to
the
judgment
not
only
of
myself
but
of
others
so
that
when
an
inner
slope
did
occur
it
was
apt
to
be
overlooked
the
first
idea
was
to
discard
slopes
altogether
notwithstanding
the
accompanying
loss
of
index
power
but
this
would
be
an
unnecessarily
trenchant
measure
the
slope
of
a
loop
though
it
be
on
the
alone
decidedly
merits
recognition
for
it
differentiates
such
loops
into
two
not
very
unequal
classes
again
there
is
little
chance
of
mistake
in
noting
it
the
impression
of
the
thumb
on
the
one
side
and
those
of
the
remaining
fingers
on
the
other
affording
easy
guidance
to
the
eye
and
judgment
these
considerations
determined
the
method
i
now
use
exclusively
by
which
table
ix
was
compiled
and
to
which
the
second
column
of
table
headed
and
in
refers
the
heading
of
the
third
column
no
slope
explains
itself
no
account
having
been
there
taken
of
any
slopes
whatever
so
and
disappear
having
become
merged
under
the
table
gives
a
very
favourable
impression
of
the
differentiating
power
of
all
these
methods
of
indexing
by
the
and
method
it
requires
as
many
as
different
to
include
the
finger
prints
of
different
persons
of
persons
and
of
the
number
of
entries
under
each
varies
greatly
reference
to
the
index
of
sets
showing
no
less
than
six
entries
nos
under
one
of
them
and
four
entries
nos
and
under
each
of
two
others
thus
although
a
large
portion
of
the
sets
are
solitary
entries
under
their
several
headings
and
can
be
found
by
a
single
reference
the
remainder
are
grouped
together
like
the
commoner
surnames
in
a
directory
they
are
troublesome
to
distinguish
and
can
not
be
subdivided
at
all
except
by
supplementary
characteristics
such
as
the
number
of
ridges
in
some
specified
part
of
the
pattern
or
the
character
of
the
cores
in
other
respects
the
difference
of
merit
between
the
three
methods
is
somewhat
greater
as
is
succinctly
indicated
by
the
next
table
table
of
different
number
of
entries
the
same
all
and
no
slopes
only
total
hence
it
is
evident
that
the
second
method
of
is
capable
of
dealing
rapidly
with
cases
but
that
the

the
great
advantage
of

lies
in
its
power
of
breaking
up
certain
large
groups
which
are
very
troublesome
to
deal
with

according

according

the
method
these
are
distributed

the
all

method
has
the
peculiar
merit
of
breaking
up
the
large
group
nos

viii
of
all
whorls
but
its
importance
is
not
great
on
that
account
as
whorls
are
distinguishable
by
their
cores
which
are
less
troublesome
to
observe
than
their

the

possible

but
there
is
much
probability
that
some
of

may
be
so
rare
that
instances
of
no
entry
under
certain
heads
would
appear
in
the
register
even
of
an
enormous
number
of
persons
hitherto
we
have
supposed
that
prints
of
the
ten
fingers
have
in
each
case
been
indexed
the
question
now
to
be
considered
is
the
gain
through
dealing
in
each
case
with
all
ten
digits
instead
of
following
the
easier
practice
of
regarding
only
a
few
of
them
the
following
table
drawn
up
from
the
hundred
cases
by
the
all
slopes
method
will
show
its

the
trouble
of
printing
reading
off
and
indexing
the
ten
digits
is
practically
twice
that
of
dealing
with
the
six
fingers
namely
three
on
each
of
the
hands
the
thumb
being
inconvenient
to
print
from
and
having
to
be
printed
separately
even
for
a
dabbed
impression
while
the
fingers
of
either
hand
can
be
dabbed
down
simultaneously
for
a
large
collection
the
ten
digit
method
is
certainly
the
best
as
it
breaks
up
the
big
battalions
also
in
case
of
one
or
more
fingers
having
been
injured
it
gives
reserve
material
to
work
upon
we
now
come
to
the
great
difficulty
in
all
classifications
that
of
transitional
cases
what
is
to
be
done
with
those
prints
which
can
not
be
certainly
classed
as
arches
loops
or
whorls
but
which
lie
between
some
two
of
them
these
occur
about
once
in
every
forty
digits
or
once
in
every
four
pairs
of
hands
the
roughest
way
is
to
put
a
mark
by
the
side
of
the
entry
to
indicate
doubt
a
better
one
is
to
make
a
mark
that
shall
express
the
nature
of
the
peculiarity
thus
a
particular
eyed
pattern
plate
fig
may
be
transitional
between
a
loop
and
a
whorl
under
whichever
of
the
two
it
is
entered
the
mark
might
be
an
to
show
that
anyhow
it
is
an
eye
then
when
it
is
required
to
discover
whether
an
index
contains
a
duplicate
of
a
given
specimen
in
which
a
transitional
pattern
occurs
the
two
headings
between
which
the
doubt
lies
have
to
be
searched
and
the
marked
entries
will
limit
the
search
many
alternative
ways
of
marking
may
be
successfully
used
but
i
am
not
yet
prepared
to
propose
one
as
being
distinctly
the
best
when
there
are
two
of
these
marks
in
the
same
set
it
seldom
happens
that
more
than
two
references
have
to
be
made
as
it
is
usual
for
the
ambiguity
to
be
of
the
same
kind
in
both
of
the
doubtful
fingers
if
the
ambiguities
were
quite
independent
then
two
marks
would
require
four
references
and
three
marks
would
require
nine
there
are
a
few
nondescript
prints
that
would
fall
under
a
separate
heading
such
as
z
similarly
as
regards
lost
or
injured
fingers
i
have
tried
various
methods
of
and
find
no
difficulty
in
any
of
them
but
general
rules
seem
inadvisable
it
being
best
to
treat
each
large
group
on
its
own
merits
one
method
that
i
have
adopted
and
described
in
the
royal
is
to
sketch
in
a
cursive
and
symbolic
form
the
patterns
of
the
several
fingers
in
the
order
in
which
they
appear
in
the
print
confining
myself
to
a
limited
number
of
symbols
such
as
might
be
used
for
printer
types
they
sufficed
fairly
for
some
thousands
of
the
finger
marks
upon
which
they
were
tried
but
doubtless
they
could
be
improved
a
little
violence
has
of
course
to
be
used
now
and
then
in
fitting
some
unusual
patterns
to
some
one
or
other
of
these
few
symbols
but
we
are
familiar
with
such
processes
in
ordinary
spelling
making
the
same
letter
do
duty
for
different
sounds
as
in
the
words
and
the
plan
of
using
symbols
has
many
secondary
merits
it
facilitates
a
leisurely
revision
of
first
determinations
it
affords
a
pictorial
record
of
the
final
judgment
that
is
directly
comparable
with
the
print
itself
and
it
almost
wholly
checks
blunders
between
inner
and
outer
slopes
a
beginner
in
finger
reading
will
educate
his
judgment
by
habitually
using
them
at
first

of
card
used
for
impressions
of
the
ten
digits
inches
fig
roller
and
its
bearings

give
great
assistance
in

up

very
large

of

the
plan
i
am
now
using
for
keeping
finger
prints
in
regular
order
is
this
in
the
principal
collection
the
prints
of
each
person
ten
digits
are
taken
on
the
same
large
card
the
four
fingers
of
either
hand
being
down
simultaneously
above
and
all
the
ten
digits
separately
below
plate
fig
each
card
has
a
hole
of
an
inch
in
diameter
punched
in
the
middle
near
to
the
bottom
edge
and
the
cards
are
kept
in
trays
which
they
loosely
fit
like
the
card
catalogues
used
in
many
libraries
each
tray
holds
easily
cards
which
are
secured
by
a
long
stout
wire
passing
like
a
skewer
through
the
ends
of
the
box
and
the
holes
in
the
cards
the
hinder
end
of
the
box
is
sloped
so
the
cards
can
be
tilted
back
and
easily
examined
they
can
be
inserted
or
removed
after
withdrawing
the
wire
it
will
be
recollected
that
the
leading
and
therefore
the
most
conspicuous
headings
in
the
index
refer
to
the
fore
middle
and
of
the
right
hand
as
entered
in
column
a
of
the
specimen

table
ix
the
variety
of
these
in
the
and
method
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
can
not
exceed
there
being
only
four
varieties
in
the
and
three
varieties
in
each
of
the
other

so
their
maximum
number
is
the
actual
number
of
such
in
cases
and
the
number
of
entries
that
fell
under
each
was
found
to
be
as
follows

this

makes
it
easy
to
calculate
beforehand
the

required
for
an

of

chapter

personal
identification
we
shall
speak
in
this
chapter
of
the
aid
that
finger
prints
can
give
to
personal
identification
supposing
throughout
that
facilities
exist
for
taking
them
well
and
cheaply
and
that
more
or
less
practice
in
reading
them
has
been
acquired
by
many
persons
a
few
introductory
words
will
show
this
supposition
to
be
reasonable
at
the
present
moment
any
printer
and
there
are
many
printers
in
every
town
would
at
a
small
charge
blacken
a
slab
and
take
the
prints
effectively
after
being
warned
to
use
very
little
ink
as
described
in
chapter
iii
the
occupation
of
finger
printing
would
however
fall
more
naturally
into
the
hands
of
photographers
who
in
addition
to
being
found
everywhere
are
peculiarly
well
suited
to
it
for
taken
as
a
class
they
are
naturally
gifted
with
manual
dexterity
and
mechanical
ingenuity
having
secured
good
impressions
they
could
multiply
them
when
necessary
and
enlarge
when
desired
while
the
ticketing
and
preservation
of
the
negatives
would
fall
into
their
usual
business
routine
as
they
already
occupy
themselves
with
one
means
of
identification
a
second
means
of
obtaining
the
same
result
is
allied
to
their
present
work
were
it
the
custom
for
persons
about
to
travel
to
ask
for
prints
of
their
fingers
when
they
were
photographed
a
familiarity
with
the
peculiarities
of
finger
prints
and
the
methods
of
describing
and
classifying
them
would
become
common
wherever
finger
prints
may
be
wanted
for
purposes
of
attestation
and
the
like
the
fact
mentioned
by
sir
herschel
as
to
the
readiness
with
which
his
native
orderlies
learnt
to
take
them
with
the
ink
of
his
office
stamp
must
not
be
forgotten
the
remarks
about
to
be
made
refer
to
identification
generally
and
are
not
affected
by
the
fact
that
the
complete
process
may
or
may
not
include
the
preliminary
search
of
a
catalogue
the
two
stages
of
search
and
of
comparison
will
be
treated
separately
towards
the
close
of
the
chapter
in
civilised
lands
honest
citizens
rarely
need
additional
means
of
identification
to
their
signatures
their
photographs
and
to
personal
introductions
the
cases
in
which
other
evidence
is
wanted
are
chiefly
connected
with
violent
death
through
accident
murder
or
suicide
which
yield
the
constant
and
gruesome
supply
to
the
morgue
of
paris
and
to
corresponding
institutions
in
other
large
towns
where
the
bodies
of
unknown
persons
are
exposed
for
identification
often
in
vain
but
when
honest
persons
travel
to
distant
countries
where
they
have
few
or
no
friends
the
need
for
a
means
of
recognition
is
more
frequently
felt
the
risk
of
death
through
accident
or
crime
is
increased
and
the
probability
of
subsequent
identification
diminished
there
is
a
possibility
not
too
remote
to
be
disregarded
especially
in
times
of
war
of
a
harmless
person
being
arrested
by
mistake
for
another
man
and
being
in
sore
straits
to
give
satisfactory
proof
of
the
error
a
signature
may
be
distrusted
as
a
forgery
there
is
also
some
small
chance
when
he
returns
to
his
own
country
after
a
long
absence
of
finding
difficulty
in
proving
who
he
is
but
in
civilised
lands
and
in
peaceable
times
the
chief
use
of
a
sure
means
of
identification
is
to
benefit
society
by
detecting
rogues
rather
than
to
establish
the
identity
of
men
who
are
honest
is
this
criminal
an
old
offender
is
this
new
recruit
a
deserter
is
this
professed
pensioner
personating
a
man
who
is
dead
is
this
upstart
claimant
to
property
the
true
heir
who
was
believed
to
have
died
in
foreign
lands
in
india
and
in
many
of
our
colonies
the
absence
of
satisfactory
means
for
identifying
persons
of
other
races
is
seriously
felt
the
natives
are
mostly
unable
to
sign
their
features
are
not
readily
distinguished
by
europeans
and
in
too
many
cases
they
are
characterised
by
a
strange
amount
of
litigiousness
wiliness
and
unveracity
the
experience
of
sir
herschel
and
the
way
in
which
he
met
these
unfavourable
conditions
by
the
method
of
finger
prints
has
been
briefly
described
in
lately
major
ferris
of
the
indian
staff
corps
happening
to
visit
my
laboratory
during
my
absence
and
knowing
but
little
of
what
sir
herschel
had
done
was
greatly
impressed
by
the
possibilities
of
finger
prints
after
acquainting
himself
with
the
process
we
discussed
the
subject
together
and
he
very
kindly
gave
me
his
views
for
insertion
here
they
are
as
follow
with
a
few
trifling
changes
of
words
during
a
period
of
years
eighteen
of
which
have
been
passed
in
the
political
department
of
the
bombay
government
the
great
need
of
an
official
system
of
identification
has
been
constantly
forced
on
my
mind
the
uniformity
in
the
colour
of
hair
eyes
and
complexion
of
the
indian
races
renders
identification
far
from
easy
and
the
difficulty
of
recording
the
description
of
an
individual
so
that
he
may
be
afterwards
recognised
is
very
great
again
their
whether
it
be
in
persian
or
devanagri
letters
is
devoid
of
character
and
gives
but
little
help
towards
identification
the
tenacity
with
which
a
native
of
india
cleaves
to
his
ancestral
land
his
innate
desire
to
acquire
more
and
more
and
the
obligation
that
accrues
to
him
at
birth
of
safeguarding
that
which
has
already
been
acquired
amounts
to
a
religion
and
passes
the
comprehension
of
the
ordinary
western
mind
this
passion
or
religion
coupled
with
a
natural
taste
for
litigation
brings
annually
into
the
civil
courts
an
enormous
number
of
suits
affecting
land
in
a
native
state
at
one
time
under
my
political
charge
the
percentage
of
suits
for
the
possession
of
land
in
which
the
title
was
disputed
amounted
to
no
less
than
while
in
per
cent
of
these
the
writing
by
which
the
transfer
of
title
purported
to
have
been
made
was
repudiated
by
the
former
as
fraudulent
and
not
executed
by
him
when
it
is
remembered
that
an
enormous
majority
of
the
landholders
whose
titles
come
into
court
are
absolutely
illiterate
and
that
their
execution
of
the
documents
is
attested
by
a
mark
made
by
a
third
party
frequently
though
not
always
apparently
interested
in
the
transfer
it
will
be
seen
that
there
is
a
wide
door
open
to
fraud
whether
by
false
repudiation
or
by
criminal
attempt
at
dispossession
it
has
frequently
happened
in
my
experience
that
a
transfer
of
title
or
possession
was
repudiated
the
person
purporting
to
have
executed
the
transfer
asserting
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
it
and
never
authorised
any
one
to
write
sign
or
present
it
for
registration
this
was
met
by
a
categorical
statement
on
the
part
of
the
beneficiary
and
of
the
attesting
witnesses
concerning
the
time
date
and
circumstances
of
the
execution
and
registration
that
demolished
the
simple
denial
of
the
man
whom
it
was
sought
to
dispossess
without
going
into
the
ethics
of
falsehood
among
western
and
eastern
peoples
it
would
be
impossible
to
explain
how
what
is
repugnant
to
the
one
as
downright
lying
is
very
frequently
considered
as
no
more
than
venial
prevarication
by
the
other
this
however
is
too
large
a
subject
for
present
purposes
but
the
fact
remains
that
perjury
is
perpetrated
in
indian
courts
to
an
extent
unknown
in
the
united
kingdom
the
interests
of
landholders
are
partially
safeguarded
by
the
act
that
requires
all
documents
effecting
the
transfer
of
immovable
property
to
be
registered
but
it
could
be
explained
though
not
in
the
short
space
of
this
letter
how
the
provisions
of
the
act
can
be
and
frequently
are
fulfilled
in
the
absence
of
the
principal
person
the
executor
enough
has
been
said
to
show
that
if
some
simple
but
efficient
means
could
be
contrived
to
identify
the
person
who
has
executed
a
bond
cases
of
fraud
such
as
these
would
practically
disappear
from
the
judicial
registers
were
the
legislature
to
amend
the
registration
act
and
require
that
the
original
document
as
well
as
the
copy
in
the
registration
book
should
bear
the
imprint
of
one
or
more
fingers
of
the
parties
to
the
deed
i
have
little
hesitation
in
saying
that
not
only
would
fraud
be
detected
but
that
in
a
short
time
the
facility
of
that
detection
would
act
as
a
deterrent
for
the
future
this
was
precisely
the
experience
of
sir
w
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
mere
question
would
be
is
the
man
a
the
same
person
as
b
or
is
he
not
and
of
that
question
the
finger
marks
would
give
unerring
proof
for
example
to
take
the
simplest
case
a
is
sued
for
possession
of
some
land
the
title
of
which
he
is
stated
to
have
parted
with
to
another
for
a
consideration
the
document
and
the
registration
book
both
bear
the
imprint
of
the
index
finger
of
the
right
hand
of
a
a
repudiates
and
a
comparison
shows
that
whereas
the
finger
pattern
of
a
is
a
whorl
the
imprint
on
the
document
is
a
loop
consequently
a
did
not
execute
it
in
the
identification
of
government
pensioners
the
finger
print
method
would
be
very
valuable
at
one
period
i
had
the
payment
of
many
hundreds
of
military
pensioners
personation
was
most
difficult
to
detect
in
persons
coming
from
a
distance
who
had
no
local
acquaintances
and
more
especially
where
the
claimants
were
women
the
marks
of
identification
noted
in
the
pension
roll
were
usually
variations
of
hair
black
eyes
brown
complexion
wheat
colour
marks
of
tattooing
on
terms
which
are
equally
appropriate
to
a
large
number
of
the
pensioners
the
description
was
supplemented
in
some
instances
where
the
pensioner
had
some
distinguishing
mark
or
scar
but
such
cases
are
considerably
rarer
than
might
be
supposed
and
in
women
the
marks
are
not
infrequently
in
such
a
position
as
to
practically
preclude
comparison
here
also
the
imprint
of
one
or
more
finger
prints
on
the
pension
certificate
would
be
sufficient
to
settle
any
doubt
as
to
identity
as
a
large
number
of
persons
pass
through
the
indian
gaols
not
only
while
undergoing
terms
of
imprisonment
but
in
default
of
payment
of
a
fine
it
could
not
but
prove
of
value
were
the
finger
prints
of
one
and
all
secured
they
might
assist
in
identifying
persons
who
have
formerly
been
convicted
of
whom
the
local
police
have
no
knowledge
and
who
bear
a
name
that
may
be
the
common
property
of
half
a
hundred
in
any
small
town
whatever
difficulty
may
be
felt
in
the
identification
of
hindoos
is
experienced
in
at
least
an
equal
degree
in
that
of
the
chinese
residents
in
our
colonies
and
settlements
who
to
european
eyes
are
still
more
alike
than
the
hindoos
and
in
whose
names
there
is
still
less
variety
i
have
already
referred
to
tabor
of
san
francisco
and
his
proposal
in
respect
to
the
registration
of
the
chinese
remarks
showing
the
need
of
some
satisfactory
method
of
identifying
them
have
reached
me
from
various
sources
the
north
borneo
august
that
lies
before
me
as
i
write
alludes
to
the
difficulty
of
identifying
coolies
either
by
photographs
or
measurements
as
likely
to
become
important
in
the
early
future
of
that
country
for
purposes
of
registration
the
method
of
printing
to
be
employed
must
be
one
that
gives
little
trouble
on
the
one
hand
and
yields
the
maximum
of
efficiency
for
that
amount
of
trouble
on
the
other
sir
herschel
impressed
simultaneously
the
fore
and
middle
fingers
of
the
right
hand
to
impress
simultaneously
the
fore
middle
and
of
the
right
hand
ought
however
to
be
better
the
trouble
being
no
greater
while
three
prints
are
obviously
more
effective
than
two
especially
for
an
comparison
moreover
the
patterns
on
the
are
much
more
variable
than
those
on
the
middle
finger
much
as
rolled
impressions
are
to
be
preferred
for
minute
and
exhaustive
comparisons
they
would
probably
be
inconvenient
for
purposes
of
registration
or
attestation
each
finger
has
to
be
rolled
separately
and
each
separate
rolling
takes
more
time
than
a
dab
of
all
the
fingers
of
one
hand
simultaneously
now
a
dabbed
impression
of
even
two
fingers
is
more
useful
for
registration
purposes
than
the
rolled
impression
of
one
much
more
is
a
dabbed
impression
of
three
especially
when
the
third
is
the
variable
again
in
a
simultaneous
impression
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
the
sequence
of
the
finger
prints
being
correct
but
there
may
be
some
occasional
bungling
when
the
fingers
are
printed
separately
for
most
criminal
investigations
and
for
some
other
purposes
also
the
question
is
not
the
simple
one
just
considered
namely
is
a
the
same
person
or
a
different
person
from
b
but
the
much
more
difficult
problem
of
who
is
this
unknown
person
x
is
his
name
contained
in
such
and
such
a
register
we
will
now
consider
how
this
question
may
be
answered
registers
of
criminals
are
kept
in
all
civilised
countries
but
in
france
they
are
indexed
according
to
the
method
of
alphonse
bertillon
which
admits
of
an
effective
search
being
made
through
a
large
collection
we
shall
see
how
much
the
differentiating
power
of
the
french
or
of
any
other
system
of
indexing
might
be
increased
by
including
finger
prints
in
the
register
bertillon
has
described
his
system
in
three
pamphlets

to
these
must
be
added
a
very
interesting
but
anonymous
pamphlet
based
on
official
documents
and
which
i
have
reason
to
know
is
authorised
by
bertillon
namely
judiciare

en

rue

besides
these
a
substantial
volume
is
forthcoming
which
may
give
a
satisfactory
solution
to
some
present
uncertainties
the
scale
on
which
the
service
is
carried
on
is
very
large
it
was
begun
in
and
by
the
end
of
no
less
than
sets
of
measures
were
in
hand
but
thus
far
only
about
one
half
of
the
persons
arrested
in
paris
were
measured
owing
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
staff
arrangements
were
then
made
for
its
further
extension
there
are
from
to
prisoners
sentenced
each
day
by
the
courts
of
law
in
paris
to
more
than
a
few
imprisonment
and
every
one
of
these
is
sent
to
the
dépôt
for
hours
while
there
they
are
now
submitted
to
a
newly
coined
word
that
has
already
come
into
use
this
is
done
in
the
forenoon
by
three
operators
and
three
clerks
six
officials
in
all
about
half
of
the
prisoners
are
old
offenders
of
whom
a
considerable
proportion
give
their
names
correctly
as
is
rapidly
verified
by
an
alphabetically
arranged
catalogue
of
cards
each
of
which
contains
front
and
profile
photographs
and
measurements
the
remainder
are
examined
strictly
their
bodily
marks
are
recorded
according
to
a
terse
system
of
a
few
letters
and
they
are
variously
measured
each
person
occupies
seven
or
eight
minutes
they
are
then
photographed
from
sixty
to
prisoners
go
through
this
complete
process
every
forenoon
in
the
afternoon
the
officials
are
engaged
in
making
numerous
copies
of
each
set
of
records
one
of
which
is
sent
to
lyon
and
another
to
marseille
where
there
are
similar
establishments
they
also
classify
the
copies
of
records
that
are
received
from
those
towns
and
elsewhere
in
france
of
which
from
seventy
to
one
hundred
arrive
daily
lastly
they
search
the
registers
for
duplicate
sets
of
measures
of
those
whether
in
paris
or
in
the
provinces
who
were
suspected
of
having
given
false
names
the
entire
staff
consists
of
ten
persons
it
is
difficult
to
rightly
interpret
the
figures
given
in
the
pamphlet
at
pp
as
they
appear
to
disagree
but
as
i
understand
them
prisoners
who
gave
false
names
in
the
year
were
recognised
by
and
only
four
other
persons
were
otherwise
discovered
to
have
been
convicted
previously
who
had
escaped
recognition
by
its
means
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
system
in
operation
in
paris
a
few
years
ago
and
was
greatly
impressed
by
the
deftness
of
the
measuring
and
with
the
swiftness
and
success
with
which
the
assistants
searched
for
the
cards
containing
entries
similar
to
the
measures
of
the
prisoner
then
under
examination
it
is
stated
in
the
that
the
basis
of
the
classification
are
the
four
measurements
their
constancy
during
adult
life
nearly
always
as
stated
holding
good
each
of
these
four
elements
severally
is
considered
as
belonging
to
one
or
other
of
three
equally
numerous
classes
small
medium
and
large
consequently
there
are
or
principal
headings
under
some
one
of
which
the
card
of
each
prisoner
is
in
the
first
instance
sorted
each
of
these
primary
headings
is
successively
subdivided
on
the
same
general
principle
of
a
classification
according
to
other
measures
that
are
more
or
less
subject
to
uncertainties
namely
the
height
the
span
the
cubit
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
ear
and
the
height
of
the
bust
the
alone
is
subjected
to
seven
divisions
the
general
result
is
pp
that
a
total
of
twelve
measures
are
employed
of
which
eleven
are
classed
on
the
principle
and
one
on
the
giving
a
final
result
of
or
more
than
a
million
possible
combinations
bertillon
considers
it
by
no
means
necessary
to
stop
here
but
in
his
chapter
on
the
infinite
extension
of
the
classification
claims
that
the
method
may
be
indefinitely
extended
the
success
of
the
system
is
considered
by
many
experts
to
be
fully
proved
notwithstanding
many
apparent
objections
one
of
which
is
the
difficulty
due
to
transitional
cases
a
belief
in
its
success
has
certainly
obtained
a
firm
hold
upon
the
popular
imagination
in
france
its
general
acceptance
elsewhere
seems
to
have
been
delayed
in
part
by
a
theoretical
error
in
the
published
calculations
of
its
efficiency
the
measures
of
the
limbs
which
are
undoubtedly
correlated
being
treated
as
independent
and
in
part
by
the
absence
of
a
sufficiently
detailed
account
of
the
practical
difficulties
experienced
in
its
employment
thus
in
the
we
are
embarrassed
what
to
choose
the
number
of
human
measures
which
vary
independently
of
each
other
being
considerable
in
the
it
has
been
shown
by
assuming
this
independent
variability
that
by
seven
measurements
photographs
can
be
separated
into
batches
of
less
than
ten
in
each
by
the
way
even
on
that
assumption
the
result
is
somewhat
exaggerated
the
figures
having
been
arrived
at
by
successively
taking
the
higher
of
the
two
nearest
round
values
in
short
the
general
tone
of
these
two
memoirs
is
one
of
enthusiastic
belief
in
the
method
based
almost
wholly
so
far
as
is
there
shown
on
questionable
grounds
of
efficiency
to
learn
how
far
correlation
interferes
with
the
regularity
of
distribution
causing
more
entries
to
be
made
under
some
than
others
as
was
the
case
with
finger
prints
i
have
classified
on
the
bertillon
system
sets
of
measures
taken
at
my
laboratory
it
was
not
practicable
to
take
more
than
three
of
the
four
primary
measures
namely
the
its
breadth
and
the
the
other
measure
that
of
is
not
made
at
my
laboratory
as
it
would
require
the
shoes
to
be
taken
off
which
is
inconvenient
since
persons
of
all
ranks
and
both
sexes
are
measured
there
but
this
matters
little
for
the
purpose
immediately
in
view
it
should
however
be
noted
that
the
and
have
especial
importance
being
only
slightly
correlated
either
together
or
with
any
other
dimension
of
the
body
many
a
small
man
has
a
head
that
is
large
in
one
or
both
directions
while
a
small
man
rarely
has
a
large
foot
finger
or
cubit
and
conversely
with
respect
to
large
men
the
following
set
of
five
measures
of
each
of
the
persons
were
then
tabulated

sits
the
measurements
were
to
the
nearest
tenth
of
an
inch
but
in
cases
of
doubt
were
recorded
in
and
with
this
moderate
minuteness
of
measurement
it
was
impossible
so
to
divide
the
measures
as
to
give
better
results
than
the
following
which
show
that
the
numbers
in
the
three
classes
are
not
as
equal
as
desirable
but
they
nevertheless
enable
us
to
arrive
at
an
approximate
idea
of
the
irregular
character
of
the

to
test
the
further
application
of
the
bertillon
method
it
would
appear
from
these
and
other
data
that
a
purely
anthropometric
classification
irrespective
of
bodily
marks
and
photographs
would
enable
an
expert
to
deal
with
registers
of
considerable
size
bearing
in
mind
that
mediocrities
differ
less
from
one
another
than
members
of
either
of
the
extreme
classes
and
would
therefore
be
more
difficult
to
distinguish
it
seems
probable
that
with
comparatively
few
exceptions
two
thousand
adults
of
the
same
sex
might
be
individualised
merely
by
means
of
twelve
careful
measures
on
the
bertillon
system
making
reasonable
allowances
for
that
small
change
of
proportions
that
occurs
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
and
for
inaccuracies
of
measurement
this
estimate
may
be
far
below
the
truth
but
more
can
not
i
think
be
safely
inferred
from
the
above
very
limited
experiment
the
system
of
registration
adopted
in
the
american
army
for
tracing
suspected
deserters
was
described
in
a
memoir

to
the
international
congress
of
demography
held
in

in
the
memoir

so
far
been
only
published
in
the
of

and
spottiswoode
its
phraseology
is
unfortunately
so
curt
as
sometimes
to
be
difficult
to
understand
it
runs
as

owing
to
obstacles
in
inaugurating
new
system
its
practical
working
began
with
and
to
include
may
months
out
of
cases
of
suspected
fraud
proved
real
there
was
some
interesting
discussion
both
upon
this
memoir
and
on
a
verbal
communication
concerning
the
french
method
that
had
been
made
by
jacques
bertillon
the
statistician
who
is
a
brother
of
its
originator
it
appeared
that
there
was
room
for
doubt
whether
the
anthropometric
method
had
received
a
fair
trial
in
america
the
measurements
being
made
by
persons
not
specially
trained
whereas
in
france
the
establishments
though
small
are
thoroughly
efficient
there
are
almost
always
moles
or
serving
for
identification
on
the
body
of
every
one
and
a
record
of
these
is
as
already
noted
an
important
though
subsidiary
part
of
the
bertillon
system
are
noted
in
the
english
registers
of
criminals
and
it
is
curious
how
large
a
proportion
of
these
men
are
tattooed
and
scarred
how
far
the
admit
of
being
usefully
charted
on
the
american
plan
it
is
difficult
to
say
the
success
of
the
method
being
largely
dependent
on
the
care
with
which
they
are
recorded
the
number
of
persons
hitherto
dealt
with
on
the
american
plan
appears
not
to
be
very
large
as
observations
of
this
class
require
the
person
to
be
undressed
they
are
unsuitable
for
popular
purposes
of
identification
but
the
marks
have
the
merit
of
serving
to
identify
at
all
ages
which
the
measurements
of
the
limbs
have
not
it
seems
strange
that
no
register
of
this
kind
so
far
as
i
know
takes
account
of
the
teeth
if
a
man
on
being
first
registered
is
deficient
in
certain
teeth
they
are
sure
to
be
absent
when
he
is
examined
on
a
future
occasion
he
may
and
probably
will
in
the
meantime
have
lost
others
but
the
fact
of
his
being
without
specified
teeth
on
the
first
occasion
excludes
the
possibility
of
his
being
afterwards
mistaken
for
a
man
who
still
possesses
them
we
will
now
separately
summarise
the
results
arrived
at
in
respect
to
the
two
processes
that
may
both
be
needed
in
order
to
effect
an
identification
first
as
regards
in
an
some
sets
of
measures
will
give
trouble
but
the
greater
proportion
can
apparently
be
catalogued
with
so
much
certainty
that
if
a
second
set
of
measures
of
any
individual
be
afterwards
taken
no
tedious
search
will
be
needed
to
hunt
out
the
former
set
including
the
bodily
marks
and
photographs
let
us
rate
the
bertillon
method
as
able
to
cope
with
a
register
of
adults
of
the
same
sex
with
a
small
and
definable
but
as
yet
unknown
average
dose
of
difficulty
which
we
will
call
a
catalogue
of
sets
of
finger
prints
easily
fulfils
the
same
conditions
i
could
lay
a
fair
claim
to
much
more
but
am
content
with
this
now
the
finger
patterns
have
been
shown
to
be
so
independent
of
other
conditions
that
they
can
not
be
notably
if
at
all
correlated
with
the
bodily
measurements
or
with
any
other
feature
not
the
slightest
trace
of
any
relation
between
them
having
yet
been
found
as
will
be
shown
at
and
more
fully
in
chapter
xii
for
instance
it
would
be
totally
impossible
to
fail
to
distinguish
between
the
finger
prints
of
twins
who
in
other
respects
appeared
exactly
alike
finger
prints
may
therefore
be
treated
without
the
fear
of
any
sensible
error
as
varying
quite
independently
of
the
measures
and
records
in
the
bertillon
system
their
inclusion
would
consequently
increase
its
power
fully
fold
suppose
one
moderate
dose
of
difficulty
is
enough
for
dealing
with
the
measurements
of
adult
persons
of
the
same
sex
by
the
bertillon
method
and
a
similar
dose
of
difficulty
with
the
finger
prints
of
persons
then
two
such
doses
could
deal
with
a
register
of
or
we
now
proceed
to
consider
the
second
and
final
process
namely
that
of
identification
by
when
the
data
concerning
a
suspected
person
are
discovered
to
bear
a
general
likeness
to
one
of
those
already
on
the
register
and
a
minute
comparison
shows
their
finger
prints
to
agree
in
all
or
nearly
all
particulars
the
evidence
thereby
afforded
that
they
were
made
by
the
same
person
far
transcends
in
trustworthiness
any
other
evidence
that
can
ordinarily
be
obtained
and
vastly
exceeds
all
that
can
be
derived
from
any
number
of
ordinary
anthropometric
data
itself
it
is
amply
sufficient
to
can
rarely
supply
more
than
grounds
for
very
strong
suspicion
the
method
of
finger
prints
affords
certainty
it
is
easy
however
to
understand
that
so
long
as
the
peculiarities
of
finger
prints
are
not
generally
understood
a
juryman
would
be
cautious
in
accepting
their
evidence
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
attention
will
now
gradually
become
drawn
to
their
marvellous
virtues
and
that
after
their
value
shall
have
been
established
in
a
few
conspicuous
cases
it
will
come
to
be
popularly
recognised
let
us
not
forget
two
great
and
peculiar
merits
of
finger
prints
they
are
free
from
all
possibility
of
faults
in
observation
or
of
clerical
error
and
they
apply
throughout
life
an
abstract
of
the
remarks
made
by
herbette
director
of
the
penitentiary
department
of
the
ministère
de
france
at
the
international
penitentiary
congress
at
rome
after
the
communication
by
alphonse
bertillon
had
been
read
may
fitly
follow
proceeding
to
a
more
extended
view
of
the
subject
and
praising
the
successful
efforts
of
bertillon
herbette
pointed
out
how
a
verification
of
the
physical
personality
and
of
the
identity
of
people
of
adult
age
would
fulfil
requirements
of
modern
society
in
an
indisputable
manner
under
very
varied
conditions
if
it
were
a
question
for
instance
of
giving
to
the
inhabitants
of
a
country
to
the
soldiers
of
an
army
or
to
travellers
proceeding
to
distant
lands
notices
or
personal
cards
as
recognisable
signs
enabling
them
always
to
prove
who
they
are
if
it
were
a
question
of
completing
the
obligatory
records
of
civil
life
by
perfectly
sure
indications
such
as
would
prevent
all
error
or
substitution
of
persons
if
it
were
a
question
of
recording
the
distinctive
marks
of
an
individual
in
documents
titles
or
contracts
where
his
identity
requires
to
be
established
for
his
own
interest
for
that
of
third
parties
or
for
that
of
the
state
there
the
anthropometric
system
of
identification
would
find
place
should
it
be
a
question
of
a
life
certificate
of
a
life
assurance
or
of
a
proof
of
death
or
should
it
be
required
to
certify
the
identity
of
a
person
who
was
insane
severely
wounded
or
of
a
dead
body
that
had
been
partly
destroyed
or
so
disfigured
as
to
be
hardly
recognisable
from
a
sudden
or
violent
death
due
to
crime
accident
shipwreck
or
battle
how
great
would
be
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
trace
these
characters
unchangeable
as
they
are
in
each
individual
infinitely
variable
as
between
one
individual
and
another
indelible
at
least
in
part
even
in
death
there
is
still
more
cause
to
be
interested
in
this
subject
when
it
is
a
question
of
identifying
persons
who
are
living
at
a
great
distance
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
considerable
time
when
the
physiognomy
the
features
and
the
physical
habits
may
have
changed
from
natural
or
artificial
causes
and
to
be
able
to
identify
them
without
taking
a
journey
and
without
cost
by
the
simple
exchange
of
a
few
lines
or
figures
that
may
be
sent
from
one
country
or
continent
to
another
so
as
to
give
information
in
america
as
to
who
any
particular
man
is
who
has
just
arrived
from
france
and
to
certify
whether
a
certain
traveller
found
in
rome
is
the
same
person
who
was
measured
in
stockholm
ten
years
before
in
one
word
to
fix
the
human
personality
to
give
to
each
human
being
an
identity
an
individuality
that
can
be
depended
upon
with
certainty
lasting
unchangeable
always
recognisable
and
easily
adduced
this
appears
to
be
in
the
largest
sense
the
aim
of
the
new
method
consequently
it
may
be
said
that
the
extent
of
the
problem
as
well
as
the
importance
of
its
solution
far
exceeds
the
limits
of
penitentiary
work
and
the
interest
which
is
however
by
no
means
inconsiderable
that
penal
action
has
excited
amongst
various
nations
these
are
the
motives
for
giving
to
the
labours
of
bertillon
and
to
their
practical
utilisation
the
publicity
they
merit
these
full
and
clear
remarks
seem
even
more
applicable
to
the
method
of
finger
prints
than
to
that
of
anthropometry
chapter
xi
heredity
some
of
those
who
have
written
on
finger
marks
affirm
that
they
are
transmissible
by
descent
others
assert
the
direct
contrary
but
no
inquiry
hitherto
appears
to
justify
a
definite
conclusion
chapter
viii
shows
a
close
correlation
to
exist
between
the
patterns
on
the
several
fingers
of
the
same
person
hence
we
are
justified
in
assuming
that
the
patterns
are
partly
dependent
on
constitutional
causes
in
which
case
it
would
indeed
be
strange
if
the
general
law
of
heredity
failed
in
this
particular
case
after
examining
many
prints
the
frequency
with
which
some
peculiar
pattern
was
found
to
characterise
members
of
the
same
family
convinced
me
of
the
reality
of
an
hereditary
tendency
the
question
was
how
to
submit
the
belief
to
numerical
tests
particular
kinships
had
to
be
selected
and
methods
of
discussion
devised
it
must
here
be
borne
in
mind
that
heredity
implies
more
than
its
original
meaning
of
a
relationship
between
parent
and
child
it
includes
that
which
connects
children
of
the
same
parents
and
which
i
have
shown
to
be
just
twice
as
close
in
the
case
of
stature
as
that
which
connects
a
child
and
either
of
its
two
parents
moreover
the
closeness
of
the
fraternal
and
the
filial
relations
are
to
a
great
extent
interdependent
for
in
any
population
whose
faculties
remain
the
same
during
successive
generations
it
has
been
shown
that
a
simple
algebraical
equation
must
exist
that
connects
together
the
three
elements
of
filial
relation
fraternal
relation
and
regression
by
which
a
knowledge
of
any
two
of
them
determines
the
value
of
the
third
so
far
as
regression
may
be
treated
as
being
constant
in
value
the
filial
and
the
fraternal
relations
become
reciprocally
connected
it
is
not
possible
briefly
to
give
an
adequate
explanation
of
all
this
now
or
to
show
how
strictly
observations
were
found
to
confirm
the
theory
this
has
been
fully
done
in
and
the
conclusions
will
here
be
assumed
the
fraternal
relation
besides
disclosing
more
readily
than
other
kinships
the
existence
or
of
heredity
is
at
the
same
time
more
convenient
because
it
is
easier
to
obtain
examples
of
brothers
and
sisters
alone
than
with
the
addition
of
their
father
and
mother
the
resemblance
between
those
who
are
twins
is
also
an
especially
significant
branch
of
the
fraternal
relationship
the
word
fraternities
will
be
used
to
include
the
children
of
both
sexes
who
are
born
of
the
same
parents
it
being
impossible
to
name
the
familiar
kinship
in
question
either
in
english
french
latin
or
greek
without
circumlocution
or
using
an
incorrect
word
thus
affording
a
striking
example
of
the
way
in
which
abstract
thought
outruns
language
and
its
expression
is
hampered
by
the
inadequacy
of
language
in
this
dilemma
i
prefer
to
fall
upon
the
second
horn
that
of
incorrectness
of
phraseology
subject
to
the
foregoing
explanation
and
definition
the
first
preliminary
experiments
were
made
with
the
help
of
the
classification
on
the
same
principle
as
that
already
described
and
utilised
in
chapter
with
the
following
addition
each
of
the
two
members
of
any
couplet
of
fingers
has
a
distinctive
name
for
instance
the
couplet
may
consist
of
a
finger
and
a
thumb
or
again
if
it
should
consist
of
two
one
will
be
a
right
and
the
other
a
left
one
but
the
two
brothers
in
a
couplet
of
brothers
rank
equally
as
such
the
plan
was
therefore
adopted
of
the
prints
of
the
first
of
the
two
brothers
that
happened
to
come
to
hand
with
an
a
and
that
of
the
second
brother
with
a
b
and
so
reducing
the
questions
to
the
shape
how
often
does
the
pattern
on
the
finger
of
a
b
brother
agree
with
that
on
the
corresponding
finger
of
an
a
brother
how
often
would
it
occur
between
two
persons
who
had
no
family
likeness
how
often
would
it
correspond
if
the
kinship
between
a
and
b
were
as
close
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
or
transposing
the
questions
and
using
the
same
words
as
in
chapter
what
is
the
relative
frequency
of
random
occurrences
observed
occurrences
utmost
possibilities
it
was
shown
in
that
chapter
how
to
find
the
value
of
upon
a
centesimal
scale
in
which
randoms
ranked
as
and
utmost
possibilities
as
the
method
there
used
of
calculating
the
frequency
of
the
random
events
will
be
accepted
without
hesitation
by
all
who
are
acquainted
with
the
theory
and
the
practice
of
problems
of
probability
still
it
is
as
well
to
occasionally
submit
calculation
to
test
the
following
example
was
sent
to
me
for
that
purpose
by
a
friend
who
not
being
mathematically
minded
had
demurred
somewhat
to
the
possibility
of
utilising
the
calculated
randoms
the
prints
of
by
mistake
for
couplets
of
prints
of
the
right
of
school
children
were
taken
by
him
from
a
large
collection
the
two
members
a

the
question
then
was
how
far
calculations
from
the
above
data
would
correspond
with
the
contents
of

the
answer
is
that
it
does
so
admirably
multiply
each
of
the
italicised
a
totals
into
each
of
the
italicised
b
totals
and
after
dividing
each
result
by
enter
it
in
the
square
at
which
the
column
that
has
the
a
total
at
its
base
is
intersected
by
the
row
that
has
the

total
at

we
thus
obtain

we
will
now
discuss
in
order
the
following
relationships
the
fraternal
first
in
the
ordinary
sense
and
then
in
the
special
case
of

of
the
same
set
filial
in
the
special
case
in
which
both
parents
have
the
same
particular
pattern
on
the
same
finger
lastly
the
relative
influence
of
the
father
and
mother
in
transmitting
their
patterns
in

were

of

were

all
yielding
the

but
these

not

owing
to
their

by
inappropriate

the

the

set
of

for

of
the

with
the
view
of
obtaining
a
more
satisfactory
result
the
patterns
were
subdivided
under
heads
and
an
experiment
was
made
with
the
fore
middle
and
of
fraternal
couplets
individuals
and
digits
by
howard
collins
who
kindly
undertook
the
considerable
labour
of
indexing
and
tabulating
them
the
provisional
list
of
standard
patterns
published
in
the
was
not
appropriate
for
this
purpose
it
related
chiefly
to
thumbs
and
consequently
omitted
the
tented
arch
it
also
referred
to
the
left
hand
but
in
the
following
tabulations
the
right
hand
has
been
used
and
its
numbering
is
rather
inconvenient
the
present
set
of
patterns
has
faults
and
can
not
be
considered
in
any
way
as
final
but
it
was
suitable
for
our
purposes
and
may
be
convenient
to
others
as
collins
worked
wholly
by
it
it
may
be
distinguished
as
the
c
set
the
banded
patterns
are
very
rarely
found
on
the
fingers
but
being
common
on
the
thumb
were
retained
on
the
chance
of
our
requiring
the
introduction
of
thumb
patterns
into
the
tabulations
the
numerals
refer
to
the
patterns
as
seen
in
impressions
of
the
only
they
would
be
equally
true
for
the
patterns
as
seen
on
the
of
the
left
hand
for
impressions
of
the
left
hand
the
numerals
up
to
inclusive
would
be
the
same
but
those
of
all
the
rest
would
be
changed
these
are
arranged
in
couplets
the
one
member
of
the
couplet
being
a
reversed
picture
of
the
other
those
in
each
couplet
being
distinguished
by
severally
bearing
an
odd
and
an
even
number
therefore
in
impressions
of
the
left
hand
would
have
to
be
changed
into
and
into

and
into
and
so
on
up
to
the
end
viz
and
the
numeral
was
used
to
express
nondescript
patterns
the
finger
prints
had
to
be
gone
through
repeatedly
some
weeks
elapsing
between
the
inspections
and
under
conditions
which
excluded
the
possibility
of
unconscious
bias
a
subject
of
frequent
communication
between
collins
and
myself
living
at
a
distance
apart
it
was
not
easy
at
the
time
they
were
made
to
bring
our
respective
interpretations
of
transitional
and
of
some
of
the
other
patterns
especially
the
invaded
loops
into
strict
accordance
so
i
prefer
to
keep
his
work
in
which
i
have
perfect
confidence
independent
from
my
own
whenever
a
fraternity
consisted
of
more
than
two
members
they
were
divided
according
to
a
prearranged
system
into
as
many
couplets
as
there
were
individuals
thus
while
a
fraternity
of
three
individuals
furnished
all
of
its
three
possible
varieties
of
couplets
one
of
four
individuals
was
not
allowed
to
furnish
more
than
four
of
its
possible
couplets
the
two
italicised
ones
being
omitted
and
so
on
without
this
precaution
a
single
very
large
family
might
exercise
a
disproportionate
and
even
overwhelming
statistical
influence
it
would
be
essential
to
exact
working
that
the
mutual
relations
of
the
patterns
should
be
taken
into
account
for
example
suppose
an
arch
to
be
found
on
the
of
one
brother
and
a
nascent
loop
on
that
of
the
other
then
as
these
patterns
are
evidently
related
their
concurrence
ought
to
be
interpreted
as
showing
some
degree
of
resemblance
however
it
was
impossible
to
take
cognizance
of
partial
resemblances
the
mutual
relations
of
the
patterns
not
having
as
yet
been
determined
with
adequate
accuracy
the
completed
tabulations
occupied
three
large
sheets
one
for
each
of
the
fingers
ruled
crossways
into
vertical
columns
for
the
a
brothers
and
horizontal
rows
for
the
b
brothers
thus
if
the
register
number
of
the
pattern
of
a
was
and
that
of
b
was
then
a
mark
would
be
put
in
the
square
limited
by
the
ninth
and
tenth
horizontal
lines
and
by
the
and
vertical
ones
the
marks
were
scattered
sparsely
over
the
sheet
those
in
each
square
were
then
added
up
and
finally
the
numbers
in
each
of
the
rows
and
in
each
of
the
columns
were
severally
totalled
if
the
number
of
couplets
had
been
much
greater
than
they
are
a
test
of
the
accuracy
with
which
their
patterns
had
been
classed
under
the
appropriate
heads
would
be
found
in
the
frequency
with
which
the
same
patterns
were
registered
in
the
corresponding
finger
of
the
a
and
b
brothers
the
a
and
b
groups
are
strictly
homogeneous
consequently
the
frequency
of
their
patterns
in
corresponding
fingers
ought
to
be
alike
the
success
with
which
this
test
has
been
fulfilled
in
the
present
case
is
passably
good
its
exact
degree
being
shown
in
the
following
paragraphs
where
the
numbers
of
entries
under
each
head
are
arranged
in
as
orderly
a
manner
as
the

all

the

have
been

in
the

way
leaving

that

are
less
than
there
are
nineteen

in

the

it
is

therefore
to

from

steady
way
in
which
the

overtop
the

that
there
is
a
greater

likeness
in
the

of

in

table

the

of

to
the
measurement
of
the

closeness
of

resemblance
in
respect
to

prints
according
to
the
method
and
under
the
reservations
already
explained
in
page
the
average
value
thus
assigned
to
it
is
a
little
more
than
the
values
obtained
from
the
three
fingers
severally
from
which
that
average
was
derived
are
and
they
agree
together
better
than
might
have
been
expected
the
value
obtained
from
a
set
of
fifty
additional
couplets
of
the
middle
fingers
only
of
fraternals
is
wider
being
its
inclusion
with
the
rest
raises
the
average
of
all
to
between
and
in
the
frequent
event
of
loops
with
an
outward
slope
on
the
middle
finger
it
is
remarkable
that
the
random
cases
are
nearly
equal
to
the
observed
ones
they
are
to
it
was
to
obtain
some
assurance
that
this
equality
was
not
due
to
statistical
accident
that
the
additional
set
of
fifty
couplets
were
tabulated
they
tell
however
the
same
tale
viz
randoms
to
observed
the
loops
on
the
confirm
this
showing
randoms
to

those
on
the
have
the
same
peculiarity
though
in
a
slighter
degree
to
the
average
of
other
patterns
shows
a
much
greater
difference
than
that
i
am
unable
to
account
for
this
curious
behaviour
of
the
loops
which
can
hardly
be
due
to
statistical
accident
in
the
face
of
so
much
concurrent
evidence
the
signs
of
heredity
between
brothers
and
sisters
ought
to
be
especially
apparent
between
twins
of
the
same
sex
who
are
physiologically
related
in
a
peculiar
degree
and
are
sometimes
extraordinarily
alike
more
rarely
they
are
remarkably
dissimilar
the
instances
of
only
a
moderate
family
resemblance
between
twins
of
the
same
sex
are
much
less
frequent
than
between
ordinary
brothers
and
sisters
or
between
twins
of
opposite
sex
all
this
has
been
discussed
in
my
in
order
to
test
the
truth
of
the
expectation
i
procured
prints
of
the
fore
middle

of

of

compared
them

the

two

their

couplets
of
fingers
four
sets
agree
in

five
sets
agree
in
one
of
the
couplets
there
are
instances
of
partial
agreement
in
five
others
and
a
disagreement
throughout
in
only
one
of
the
seventeen
sets
in

of

made
to
compare
with
this
six
agreed
in
two
of
their

and
five
agreed
in

there
can
not
then
be
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
the
strong
tendency
to
resemblance
in
the
finger
patterns
in
twins
this
remark
must
by
no
means
be
forced
into
the
sense
of
meaning
that
the
similarity
is
so
great
that
the
finger
print
of
one
twin
might
occasionally
be
mistaken
for
that
of
the
other
when
patterns
fall
into
the
same
class
their
general
forms
may
be
conspicuously
different
see
while
their
smaller
details
namely
the
number
of
ridges
and
the
minutiæ
are
practically
independent
of
the
pattern
it
may
be
mentioned
that
i
have
an
inquiry
in
view
which
has
not
yet
been
fairly
begun
owing
to
the
want
of
sufficient
data
namely
to
determine
the
minutest
biological
unit
that
may
be
hereditarily
transmissible
the
minutiæ
in
the
finger
prints
of
twins
seem
suitable
objects
for
this
purpose
of
when
two
parents
are
alike
the
average
resemblance
in
stature
at
all
events
which
their
children
bear
to
them
is
as
close
as
the
fraternal
resemblance
between
the
children
and
twice
as
close
as
that
which
the
children
bear
to
either
parent
separately
when
the
parents
are
unlike
the
parentages
affording
fifty
couplets
of
the
fore

respectively
give

the
total

these

which

the
same

as

this
fact
requires
analysis
as
on
account
of
the
great
frequency
of
loops
and
especially
of
the
pattern
no
on
the
middle

a
large
number
of
the

of
cases
is
too
few
to
justify
quantitative
conclusions
it
is
not
for
the
present
worth
while
to
extend
them
for
the
reason
already
mentioned
namely
an
ignorance
of
the
allowance
that
ought
to
be
made
for
related
patterns
on
this
account
it
does
not
seem
useful
to
print
the
results
of
a
large
amount
of
tabulation
bearing
on
the
simple
filial
relationship
between
the
child
and
either
parent

so
far
as
appears

of
those
statistical
accidents
which
are
equivalent
to
long
runs
of
luck
at
a
gaming
table
a
concurrence
in
the
figures
brought
out
by
collins
suggested
to
him
the
existence
of
a
decided
preponderance
of
maternal
influence
in
the
hereditary
transmission
of
finger
patterns
his
further
inquiries
have
however
cast
some
doubt
on
earlier
and
provisional
conclusions
and
the
following
epitomises
all
of
value
that
can
as
yet
be
said
in
favour
of
the
superiority
of
the
maternal
influence
the
fore

and
of
the
right

of
the

mother
and
all
their
accessible

in
many
families
were
severally
tabulated
under
the
heads
already
specified
the
total
number
of
children
was
namely
sons
and
daughters
the
same
pattern
was
found
on
the
same
finger
both
of
a
child
and
of
one
or
other
of
his
parents

the
entries
in

are
not
comparable
on
equal
terms
on
account
of
the
large
difference
between
the
numbers
of
the
sons
and
daughters
this
difference
is
easily
remedied
by
multiplying
the
number
of

by
that
is
by
as
has
been
done
in
the
fifth
column
headed

it
would
appear
from
these
figures
that
the
maternal
influence
is
more
powerful
than
the
paternal
in
the
proportion
of
to
or
as
to
but
as
some
of
the
details
from
which
the

are
built
up
vary
rather
widely
it
is
better
for
the
present
to
reserve
an
opinion
as

races
and
classes
the
races
whose
finger
prints
i
have
studied
in
considerable
numbers
are
english
pure
welsh
hebrew
and
negro
also
some
basques
from
cambo
in
the
french
pyrenees
twenty
miles
of
bayonne
for
the
welsh
prints
i
am
primarily
indebted
to
the
very
obliging
help
of
atkinson
of
cardiff
who
interested
the
masters
of
schools
in
purely
mountainous
districts
on
my
behalf
for
the
hebrew
prints
to
isidore
spielman
who
introduced
me
to
the
great
hebrew
schools
in
london
whose
gave
cordial
assistance
and
for
the
negro
prints
to
sir
george
taubman
goldie
dep
governor
of
the
royal
niger
who
interested
dr
crosse
on
my
behalf
from
whom
valuable
sets
of
prints
were
received
together
with
particulars
of
the
races
of
the
men
from
whom
they
were
made
as
to
the
basques
they
were
printed
by
myself
it
requires
considerable
patience
and
caution
to
arrive
at
trustworthy
conclusions
but
it
may
emphatically
be
said
that
there
is
no
pattern
which
characterises
persons
of
any
of
the
above
races
there
is
no
particular
pattern
that
is
special
to
any
one
of
them
which
when
met
with
enables
us
to
assert
or
even
to
suspect
the
nationality
of
the
person
on
whom
it
appeared
the
only
differences
so
far
observed
are
statistical
and
can
not
be
determined
except
through
patience
and
caution
and
by
discussing
large
groups
i
was
misled
at
first
by
some
accidental
observations
and
as
it
seemed
reasonable
to
expect
to
find
racial
differences
in
finger
marks
the
inquiries
were
continued
in
varied
ways
until
hard
fact
had
made
hope
no
longer
justifiable
after
preliminary
study
i
handed
over
the
collection
of
racial
finger
prints
to
mr
howard
collins
who
kindly
undertook
the
labour
of
tabulating
them
in
many
ways
of
which
it
will
be
only
necessary
to
give
an
example
thus
at
one
time
attention
was
concentrated
on
a
single
finger
and
a
single
pattern
the
most
instructive
instance
being
that
of
arches
on
the
right
they
admit
of
being
defined
with
sufficient
clearness
having
only
one
doubtful
frontier
of
much
importance
namely
that
at
which
they
begin
to
break
away
into
etc
they
also
occur
with
considerable
frequency
on
the
so
the
results
from
a
few
hundred
specimens
ought
to
be
fairly
trustworthy
it
mattered
little
in
the
inquiry
at
what
level
the
limit
was
drawn
to
separate
arches
from
so
long
as
the
same
limit
was
observed
in
all
races
alike
much
pains
were
taken
to
secure
uniformity
of
treatment
and
collins
selected
two
limits
the
one
based
on
a
strict
and
the
other
on
a
somewhat
less
strict
interpretation
of
the
term
arches
but
the
latter
was
not
so
liberal
as
that
which
i
had
used
myself
in
the
earlier
inquiries
see
his
results
showed
no
great
difference
in
the
proportionate
frequency
of
arches
in
the
different
races
whichever
limit
was
observed
the
following
table
refers
to
the
more
liberal
limit

the
two
contrasted
values
here
are
the
english
and
the

the
cases
of
the
latter
give
a
percentage
result
of
which
differs
as
may
be
seen
less
than
per
cent
from
that
of
any
one
of
the
four
large
groups
upon
which
the
average
is
based
the
cases
of
english
are
comparatively
few
but
the
experience
i
have
had
of
other
english
prints
is
so
large
as
to
enable
me
to
say
confidently
that
the
percentage
result
of
is
not
too
great
it
follows
that
the
percentage
of
arches
in
the
english
and
in
the
hebrew
differs
in
the
ratio
of
to
or
nearly
as
to
this
is
the
largest
statistical
difference
yet
met
with
the
deficiency
in
arches
among
the
hebrews
and
to
some
extent
in
loops
also
is
made
up
by
a
superiority
in
whorls
chiefly
of
the
tendril
or
patterns
it
would
be
very
rash
to
suppose
that
this
relative
infrequency
of
arches
among
the
hebrews
was
of
fundamental
importance
considering
that
such
totally
distinct
races
as
the
welsh
and
the
negro
have
them
in
an
intermediate
proportion
still
why
does
it
occur
the
only
answer
i
can
suggest
is
that
the
patterns
being
in
some
degree
hereditary
such
accidental
preponderances
as
may
have
existed
among
a
not
very
numerous
ancestry
might
be
perpetuated
i
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
local
peculiarities
of
this
sort
exist
in
england
the
children
in
schools
of
some
localities
seeming
to
be
statistically
more
alike
in
their
patterns
than
english
children
generally
another
of
the
many
experiments
was
the
tabulation
separately
by
collins
of
the
fore
middle
and
of
the
right
hand
of
fifty
persons
of
each
of
the
five
races
english
welsh
basque
hebrew
and
different
groups
of
negroes
the
number
of
instances
is
of
course
too
small
for
statistical
deductions
but
they
served
to
make
it
clear
that
no
very
marked
characteristic
distinguished
the
races
the
impressions
from
negroes
betray
the
general
clumsiness
of
their
fingers
but
their
patterns
are
not
so
far
as
i
can
find
different
from
those
of
others
they
are
not
simpler
as
judged
either
by
their
contours
or
by
the
number
of
origins
embranchments
islands
and
enclosures
contained
in
them
still
whether
it
be
from
pure
fancy
on
my
part
or
from
the
way
in
which
they
were
printed
or
from
some
real
peculiarity
the
general
aspect
of
the
negro
print
strikes
me
as
characteristic
the
width
of
the
ridges
seems
more
uniform
their
intervals
more
regular
and
their
courses
more
parallel
than
with
us
in
short
they
give
an
idea
of
greater
simplicity
due
to
causes
that
i
have
not
yet
succeeded
in
submitting
to
the
test
of
measurement
the
above
are
only
a
few
examples
of
the
laborious
work
so
kindly
undertaken
for
me
by
collins
but
it
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
to
give
more
in
this
book
as
no
positive
results
have
as
yet
been
derived
from
it
other
than
the
little
already
mentioned
the
most
hopeful
direction
in
which
this
inquiry
admits
of
being
pursued
is
among
the
hill
tribes
of
india
australian
blacks
and
other
diverse
and
aboriginal
races
the
field
of
ethnology
is
large
and
it
would
be
unwise
as
yet
to
neglect
the
chance
of
somewhere
finding
characteristic
patterns
differences
between
finger
prints
of
different
classes
might
continue
to
exist
although
those
of
different
races
are
inconspicuous
because
every
race
contains
men
of
various
temperaments
and
faculties
and
we
can
not
tell
except
by
observation
whether
any
of
these
are
correlated
with
the
finger
marks
several
different
classes
have
been
examined
both
by
collins
and
myself
the
ordinary
laboratory
work
supplies
finger
prints
of
persons
of
much
culture
and
of
many
students
both
in
the
art
and
in
the
science
schools
i
took
a
large
number
of
prints
from
the
worst
idiots
in
the
london
district
through
the
obliging
assistance
of
fletcher
beech
of
the
darenth
asylum
my
collections
made
at
board
schools
are
numerous
and
i
have
one
of
field
labourers
in
dorsetshire
and
somersetshire
but
there
is
no
notable
difference
in
any
of
them
for
example
the
measurements
of
the
gave
the
same
results
in
the
and
in
the
and
i
have
prints
of
eminent
thinkers
and
of
eminent
statesmen
that
can
be
matched
by
those
of
congenital
idiots
no
indications
of
temperament
character
or
ability
are
to
be
found
in
finger
marks
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover
of
course
these
conclusions
must
not
be
applied
to
the
general
shape
of
the
hand
which
as
yet
i
have
not
studied
but
which
seems
to
offer
a
very
interesting
field
for
exact
inquiry
chapter
xiii
genera
the
same
familiar
patterns
recur
in
every
large
collection
of
finger
prints
and
the
eye
soon
selects
what
appear
to
be
typical
forms
but
are
they
truly
typical
or
not
by
a
type
i
understand
an
ideal
form
around
which
the
actual
forms
are
grouped
very
closely
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
and
becoming
more
rare
with
increasing
rapidity
at
an
increasing
distance
from
it
just
as
is
the
case
with
shot
marks
to
the
right
or
left
of
a
line
drawn
vertically
through
the
bull
eye
of
a
target
the
analogy
is
exact
in
both
cases
there
is
a
point
of
departure
in
both
cases
the
departure
of
individual
instances
from
that
point
is
due
to
a
multitude
of
independently
variable
causes
in
short
both
are
realisations
of
the
now
theoretical
law
of
frequency
of
error
the
problem
then
is
this
take
some
one
of
the
patterns
such
as
it
appears
on
a
particular
digit
say
a
loop
on
the
right
thumb
find
the
average
number
of
ridges
that
cross
a
specified
portion
of
it
then
this
average
value
will
determine
an
ideal
centre
from
which
individual
departures
may
be
measured
next
tabulate
the
frequency
of
the
departures
that
attain
to
each
of
many
successive
specified
distances
from
that
ideal
centre
then
see
whether
their
diminishing
frequency
as
the
distances
increase
is
or
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
frequency
of
error
if
it
is
then
the
central
form
has
the
attributes
of
a
true
type
and
such
will
be
shown
to
be
the
case
with
the
loops
of
either
thumb
i
shall
only
give
the
data
and
the
results
not
the
precise
way
in
which
they
are
worked
out
because
an
account
of
the
method
employed
in
similar
cases
will
be
found
in
and
again
in
the
memoir
on
finger
prints
in
the
it
is
too
technical
to
be
appropriate
here
and
would
occupy
too
much
space
the
only
point
which
need
be
briefly
explained
and
of
which
readers
might
be
ignorant
is
how
a
single
numerical
table
derived
from
abstract
calculations
can
be
made
to
apply
to
such
minute
objects
as
finger
prints
as
well
as
to
the
shot
marks
on
a
huge
target
what
is
the
common
unit
by
which
departures
on
such
different
scales
are
measured
the
answer
is
that
it
is
a
unit
appropriate
to
series
and
technically
called
the
probable
error
or
more
briefly
in
the
headings
to
the
following
tables
in
order
to
determine
it
the
range
of
the
central
half
of
the
series
has
to
be
measured
namely
of
that
part
of
the
series
which
remains
after
its
two
extreme
quarters
have
been
cut
off
and
removed
the
series
had
no
limitation
before
its
two
ends
tailing
away
indefinitely
into
nothingness
but
by
the
artifice
of
lopping
off
a
definite
fraction
of
the
whole
series
from
both
ends
of
it
a
length
call
it
pq
is
obtained
such
series
as
have
usually
to
be
dealt
with
are
fairly
symmetrical
so
the
position
of
the
point
m
between
p
and
q
corresponds
with
rough
accuracy
to
the
average
of
the
positions
of
all
the
members
of
the
series
that
is
to
the
point
whence
departures
have
to
be
measured
mp
or
mq
or
still
better
mp
mq
is
the
probable
error
it
is
so
called
because
the
amount
of
error
or
departure
from
m
of
any
one
observation
falls
just
as
often
within
the
distance
pe
as
it
falls

of

pe
or
a
multiple
of

the
actual

to
be
converted
into
another
scale

the
pe
of
that

these
points
were
pricked
in
each
print
with
a
fine
needle
the
print
was
then
turned
face
downwards
and
careful
measurements
made
between
the
prick
holes
at
the
back
also
the
number
of
ridges
in
ah
were
counted
the
ridge
at
a
being
reckoned
as
the
next
ridge
as
and
so
on
up
to
whenever
the
line
ah
passed
across
the
neck
of
a
bifurcation
there
was
necessarily
a
single
ridge
on
one
side
of
the
point
of
intersection
and
two
ridges
on
the
other
so
there
would
clearly
be
doubt
whether
to
reckon
the
neck
as
one
or
as
two
ridges
a
compromise
was
made
by
counting
it
as
after
the
number
of
ridges
in
ah
had
been
counted
in
each
case
any
residual
fractions

alternately
treated
as

as
finally
six

were
obtained

for

three
for

they
referred
respectively
to
the
number

to
all
the
three
being
independent
of

the
number
of
measures
in
each
of
the
six
series
varied
from

are
reduced
to
percentages
in

xxxi
we
see
at
a
glance
that
the
different
numbers
of
ridges
in
ah
do
not
occur
with
equal
frequency
that
a
single
ridge
in
the
thumb
is
a
rarity
and
so
are
cases
above
fifteen
in
number
but
those
of
seven
eight
and
nine
are
frequent
there
is
clearly
a
rude
order
in
their
distribution
the
number
of
cases
tailing
away
into
nothingness
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
column
a
vast
amount
of
statistical
analogy
assures
us
that
the
orderliness
of
the
distribution
would
be
increased
if
many
more
cases
had
been
observed
and
later
on
this
inference
will
be
confirmed
there
is
a
sharp
inferior
limit
to
the
numbers
of
ridges
because
they
can
not
be
less
than
but
independently
of
this
we
notice
the
infrequency
of
small
numbers
as
well
as
of
large
ones
there
is
no
strict
limit
to
the
latter
but
the
trend
of
the
entries
shows
that
forty
say
or
more
ridges
in
ah
are
practically
impossible
therefore
in
no
individual
case
can
the
number
of
ridges
in
ah
depart
very
widely
from
seven
eight
or
nine
though
the
range
of
possible
departures
is
not
sharply
defined
except
at
the
lower
limit
of
the
range
of
variation
is
rounded
off
to
use
a
common
but
very
inaccurate
expression
often
applied
to
the
way
in
which
genera
are
isolated
the
range
of
possible
departures
is
not
defined
by
any
rigid
boundary
but
the
rarity
of
the
stragglers
rapidly
increases
with
the
distance
at
which
they
are
found
until
no
more
of
them
are
met
with
the
values
of
and
of
run
in
a
less
orderly
sequence
but
concur
distinctly
in
telling
a
similar
tale
considering
the
paucity
of
the
observations
there
is
nothing
in
these
results
to
contradict
the
expectation
of
increased
regularity
should
a
large
addition
be
made
to
their
number

is

from

by
a
process
described
by
myself
in
many
publications
more
especially
in
and
will
now
be
assumed
as
understood
each
of
the
six
pairs
of
columns
contain
side
by
side
the
observed
and
calculated
values
of
one
of
the
six
series
the
data
on
which
the
calculations
were
made
being
also
entered
at
the
top
the
calculated
figures
agree
with
the
observed
ones
very
respectably
throughout
as
can
be
judged
even
by
those
who
are
ignorant
of
the
principles
of
the
method
let
us
take
the
value
that
per
cent
of
each
of
the
six
series
falls
short
of
and
per
cent
exceed
they
are
entered
in
the
line
opposite
we
find
for
the
six
pairs
successively
the
correspondence
between
the
more
mediocre
cases
is
much
closer
than
these
and
very
much
closer
than
between
the
extreme
cases
given
in
the
table
namely
the
values
that
per
cent
fall
short
of
and
exceed
these
are
of
course
less
regular
the
observed
instances
being
very
few
but
even
here
the
observations
are
found
to
agree
respectably
well
with
the
proportions
given
by
calculation
which
is
necessarily
based
upon
the
supposition
of
an
infinite
number
of
cases
having
been
included
in
the
series
as
the
want
of
agreement
between
calculation
and
observation
must
be
caused
in
part
by
the
paucity
of
observations
it
is
worth
while
to
make
a
larger
group
by
throwing
the
six
series
together
as
in
table
making
a
grand
total
of
observations
their
value
is
not
so
great
as
if
they
were
observations
taken
from
that
number
of
different
persons
still
they
are
equivalent
to
a
large
increase
of
those
already
discussed
the
six
series
of
observed
values
were
made
comparable
on
equal
terms
by
first
reducing
them
to
a
uniform
pe
and
then
by
assigning
to
m
the
point
of
departure
the
value
of
the
results
are
given
in
the
last
column
but
one
where
the
orderly
run
of
the
observed
data
is
much
more
conspicuous
than
it
was
before
though
there
is
an
obvious
want
of
exact
symmetry
in
the
observed
values
their
general
accord
with
those
of
the
calculated
values
is
very
fair
it
is
quite
close
enough
to
establish
the
general
proposition
that
we
are
justified
in
the
conception
of
a
typical
form
of
loop
different
for
the
two
thumbs
the
departure
from
the
typical
form
being
usually
small
sometimes
rather
greater
and
rarely
greater
still
i
do
not
see
my
way
to
discuss
the
variations
of
the
arches
because
they
possess
no
distinct
points
of
reference
but
their
general
appearance
does
not
give
the
impression
of
clustering
around
a
typical
centre
they
suggest
the
idea
of
a
whose
stream
begins
to
broaden
out
from
the
first
as
regards
other
patterns
i
have
made
many
measurements
altogether
but
the
specimens
of
each
sort
were
comparatively
few
except
in
whorled
patterns
in
all
cases
where
i
was
able
to
form
a
opinion
the
existence
of
a
typical
centre
was
indicated
it
would
be
tedious
to
enumerate
the
many
different
trials
made
for
my
own
satisfaction
to
gain
assurance
that
the
variability
of
the
several
patterns
is
really
of
the
kind
just
described
in
the
first
trial
i
measured
in
various
ways
the
dimensions
of
about
enlarged
photographs
of
loops
and
about
as
many
of
other
patterns
and
found
that
the
measurements
in
each
and
every
case
formed
a
series
i
do
not
care
to
submit
these
results
because
they
necessitate
more
explanation
and
analysis
than
the
interest
of
the
corrected
results
would
perhaps
justify
to
eliminate
from
them
the
effect
of
variety
of
size
of
thumb
and
some
other
uncertainties
those
measurements
referred
to
some
children
a
few
women
many
youths
and
a
fair
number
of
adults
and
allowance
has
to
be
made
for
variability
in
stature
in
each
of
these
classes
the
proportions
of
a
typical
loop
on
the
thumb
are
easily
ascertained
if
we
may
assume
that
the
most
frequent
values
of
its
variable
elements
taken
separately
are
the
same
as
those
that
enter
into
the
most
frequent
combination
of
the
elements
taken
collectively
this
would
necessarily
be
true
if
the
variability
of
each
element
separately
and
that
of
the
sum
of
them
in
combination
were
all
strictly
normal
but
as
they
are
only
the
assumption
must
be
tested
i
have
done
so
by
making
the
comparisons
and
shown
in
table
which
come
out
correctly
to
within

first
decimal

value
of
median
of
all

it
has
been
shown
that
the
patterns
are
hereditary
and
we
have
seen
that
they
are
uncorrelated
with
race
or
temperament
or
any
other
noticeable
peculiarity
inasmuch
as
groups
of
very
different
classes
are
alike
in
their
finger
marks
they
can
not
exercise
the
slightest
influence
on
marriage
selection
the
very
existence
both
of
the
ridges
and
of
the
patterns
having
been
almost
overlooked
they
are
too
small
to
attract
attention
or
to
be
thought
worthy
of
notice
we
therefore
possess
a
perfect
instance
of
promiscuity
in
marriage
or
as
it
is
now
called
panmixia
in
respect
to
these
patterns
we
might
consequently
have
expected
them
to
be
hybridised
but
that
is
not
the
case
they
to
their
classes
are
as
clearly
separated
as
those
of
any
of
the
genera
of
plants
and
animals
they
keep
pure
and
distinct
as
if
they
had
severally
descended
from
a
ancestry
each
in
respect
to
its
own
peculiar
character
as
regards
other
forms
of
natural
selection
we
know
that
races
are
kept
pure
by
the
much
more
frequent
destruction
of
those
individuals
who
depart
the
more
widely
from
the
typical
centre
but
natural
selection
was
shown
to
be
inoperative
in
respect
to
individual
varieties
of
patterns
and
unable
to
exercise
the
slightest
check
upon
their
vagaries
yet
for
all
that
the
loops
and
other
classes
of
patterns
are
isolated
from
one
another
just
as
thoroughly
and
just
in
the
same
way
as
are
the
genera
or
species
of
plants
and
animals
there
is
no
statistical
difference
between
the
form
of
the
law
of
distribution
of
individual
loops
about
their
respective
typical
centres
and
that
of
the
law
by
which
say
the
shrimps
described
in
weldon
recent
memoirs
roy
and
are
distributed
about
theirs
in
both
cases
the
distribution
is
in
with
the
theoretical
law
of
frequency
of
error
this
form
of
distribution
being
entirely
caused
in
the
patterns
by
conditions
and
in
no
way
by
natural
selection
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
that
term
it
is
impossible
not
to
recognise
the
fact
so
clearly
illustrated
by
these
patterns
in
the
thumbs
that
natural
selection
has
no
monopoly
of
influence
in
the
construction
of
genera
but
that
it
could
be
wholly
dispensed
with
the
internal
conditions
acting
by
themselves
being
sufficient
when
the
internal
conditions
are
in
harmony
with
the
external
ones
as
they
appear
to
be
in
all
races
their
joint
effects
will
curb
individual
variability
more
tightly
than
either
could
do
by
itself
the
normal
character
of
the
distribution
about
the
typical
centre
will
not
be
thereby
interfered
with
the
probable
divergence
probable
error
of
an
individual
taken
at
random
will
be
lessened
and
that
is
all
not
only
is
it
impossible
to
substantiate
a
claim
for
natural
selection
that
it
is
the
sole
agent
in
forming
genera
but
it
seems
from
the
experience
of
artificial
selection
that
it
is
scarcely
competent
to
do
so
by
favouring
mere
in
the
sense
in
which
i
understand
the
term
my
contention
is
that
it
acts
by
favouring
small
mere
varieties
from
a
common
typical
centre
blend
freely
in
the
offspring
and
the
offspring
of
every
race
whose
characters
are
constant
necessarily
tend
as
i
have
often
shown
to
regress
towards
their
common
typical
centre
sports
on
the
other
hand
do
not
blend
freely
they
are
fresh
typical
centres
or
which
suddenly
arise
we
do
not
yet
know
precisely
through
what
uncommon
concurrence
of
circumstance
and
which
observations
show
to
be
strongly
transmissible
by
inheritance
a
mere
variety
can
never
establish
a
in
the
forward
course
of
evolution
but
each
new
sport
affords
one
a
substantial
change
of
type
is
effected
as
i
conceive
by
a
succession
of
small
changes
of
typical
centre
each
more
or
less
stable
and
each
being
in
its
turn
favoured
and
established
by
natural
selection
to
the
exclusion
of
its
competitors
the
distinction
between
a
mere
variety
and
a
sport
is
real
and
fundamental
i
argued
this
point
in
but
had
then
to
draw
my
illustrations
from
experiences
no
appropriate
physiological
ones
being
then
at
