a
trivial
incident
the
chorus
girl
one
day
when
she
was
younger
and
and
when
her
voice
was
stronger
nikolay
petrovitch
kolpakov
her
adorer
was
sitting
in
the
outer
room
in
her
summer
villa
it
was
intolerably
hot
and
stifling
kolpakov
who
had
just
dined
and
drunk
a
whole
bottle
of
inferior
port
felt
and
out
of
sorts
both
were
bored
and
waiting
for
the
heat
of
the
day
to
be
over
in
order
to
go
for
a
walk
all
at
once
there
was
a
sudden
ring
at
the
door
kolpakov
who
was
sitting
with
his
coat
off
in
his
slippers
jumped
up
and
looked
inquiringly
at
pasha
it
must
be
the
postman
or
one
of
the
girls
said
the
singer
kolpakov
did
not
mind
being
found
by
the
postman
or
pasha
lady
friends
but
by
way
of
precaution
gathered
up
his
clothes
and
went
into
the
next
room
while
pasha
ran
to
open
the
door
to
her
great
surprise
in
the
doorway
stood
not
the
postman
and
not
a
girl
friend
but
an
unknown
woman
young
and
beautiful
who
was
dressed
like
a
lady
and
from
all
outward
signs
was
one
the
stranger
was
pale
and
was
breathing
heavily
as
though
she
had
been
running
up
a
steep
flight
of
stairs
what
is
it
asked
pasha
the
lady
did
not
at
once
answer
she
took
a
step
forward
slowly
looked
about
the
room
and
sat
down
in
a
way
that
suggested
that
from
fatigue
or
perhaps
illness
she
could
not
stand
then
for
a
long
time
her
pale
lips
quivered
as
she
tried
in
vain
to
speak
is
my
husband
here
she
asked
at
last
raising
to
pasha
her
big
eyes
with
their
red
lids
husband
whispered
pasha
and
was
suddenly
so
frightened
that
her
hands
and
feet
turned
cold
what
husband
she
repeated
beginning
to
tremble
my
husband
nikolay
petrovitch
kolpakov
n
no
madam
i
i
do
know
any
husband
a
minute
passed
in
silence
the
stranger
several
times
passed
her
handkerchief
over
her
pale
lips
and
held
her
breath
to
stop
her
inward
trembling
while
pasha
stood
before
her
motionless
like
a
post
and
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
and
terror
so
you
say
he
is
not
here
the
lady
asked
this
time
speaking
with
a
firm
voice
and
smiling
oddly
i
i
do
know
who
it
is
you
are
asking
about
you
are
horrid
mean
vile
the
stranger
muttered
scanning
pasha
with
hatred
and
repulsion
yes
yes
you
are
horrid
i
am
very
very
glad
that
at
last
i
can
tell
you
so
pasha
felt
that
on
this
lady
in
black
with
the
angry
eyes
and
white
slender
fingers
she
produced
the
impression
of
something
horrid
and
unseemly
and
she
felt
ashamed
of
her
chubby
red
cheeks
the
on
her
nose
and
the
fringe
on
her
forehead
which
never
could
be
combed
back
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
had
been
thin
and
had
had
no
powder
on
her
face
and
no
fringe
on
her
forehead
then
she
could
have
disguised
the
fact
that
she
was
not
respectable
and
she
would
not
have
felt
so
frightened
and
ashamed
to
stand
facing
this
unknown
mysterious
lady
where
is
my
husband
the
lady
went
on
though
i
do
care
whether
he
is
here
or
not
but
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
the
money
has
been
missed
and
they
are
looking
for
nikolay
petrovitch
they
mean
to
arrest
him
that
your
doing
the
lady
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
in
great
excitement
pasha
looked
at
her
and
was
so
frightened
that
she
could
not
understand
he
be
found
and
arrested
said
the
lady
and
she
gave
a
sob
and
in
that
sound
could
be
heard
her
resentment
and
vexation
i
know
who
has
brought
him
to
this
awful
position
low
horrid
creature
loathsome
mercenary
hussy
the
lady
lips
worked
and
her
nose
wrinkled
up
with
disgust
i
am
helpless
do
you
hear
you
low
woman
i
am
helpless
you
are
stronger
than
i
am
but
there
is
one
to
defend
me
and
my
children
god
sees
all
he
is
just
he
will
punish
you
for
every
tear
i
have
shed
for
all
my
sleepless
nights
the
time
will
come
you
will
think
of
me
silence
followed
again
the
lady
walked
about
the
room
and
wrung
her
hands
while
pasha
still
gazed
blankly
at
her
in
amazement
not
understanding
and
expecting
something
terrible
i
know
nothing
about
it
madam
she
said
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
you
are
lying
cried
the
lady
and
her
eyes
flashed
angrily
at
her
i
know
all
about
it
i
known
you
a
long
time
i
know
that
for
the
last
month
he
has
been
spending
every
day
with
you
yes
what
then
what
of
it
i
have
a
great
many
visitors
but
i
do
force
anyone
to
come
he
is
free
to
do
as
he
likes
i
tell
you
they
have
discovered
that
money
is
missing
he
has
embezzled
money
at
the
office
for
the
sake
of
such
a
creature
as
you
for
your
sake
he
has
actually
committed
a
crime
listen
said
the
lady
in
a
resolute
voice
stopping
short
facing
pasha
you
can
have
no
principles
you
live
simply
to
do
harm
your
object
but
one
ca
imagine
you
have
fallen
so
low
that
you
have
no
trace
of
human
feeling
left
he
has
a
wife
children
if
he
is
condemned
and
sent
into
exile
we
shall
starve
the
children
and
understand
that
and
yet
there
is
a
chance
of
saving
him
and
us
from
destitution
and
disgrace
if
i
take
them
nine
hundred
roubles
they
will
let
him
alone
only
nine
hundred
roubles
what
nine
hundred
roubles
pasha
asked
softly
i
i
know
i
have
taken
it
i
am
not
asking
you
for
nine
hundred
roubles
you
have
no
money
and
i
do
want
your
money
i
ask
you
for
something
else
men
usually
give
expensive
things
to
women
like
you
only
give
me
back
the
things
my
husband
has
given
you
madam
he
has
never
made
me
a
present
of
anything
pasha
wailed
beginning
to
understand
where
is
the
money
he
has
squandered
his
own
and
mine
and
other
people
what
has
become
of
it
all
listen
i
beg
you
i
was
carried
away
by
indignation
and
have
said
a
lot
of
nasty
things
to
you
but
i
apologize
you
must
hate
me
i
know
but
if
you
are
capable
of
sympathy
put
yourself
in
my
position
i
implore
you
to
give
me
back
the
things
h
said
pasha
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
would
with
pleasure
but
god
is
my
witness
he
never
made
me
a
present
of
anything
believe
me
on
my
conscience
however
you
are
right
though
said
the
singer
in
confusion
he
did
bring
me
two
little
things
certainly
i
will
give
them
back
if
you
wish
it
pasha
pulled
out
one
of
the
drawers
in
the
and
took
out
of
it
a
hollow
gold
bracelet
and
a
thin
ring
with
a
ruby
in
it
here
madam
she
said
handing
the
visitor
these
articles
the
lady
flushed
and
her
face
quivered
she
was
offended
what
are
you
giving
me
she
said
i
am
not
asking
for
charity
but
for
what
does
not
belong
to
you
what
you
have
taken
advantage
of
your
position
to
squeeze
out
of
my
husband
that
weak
unhappy
man
on
thursday
when
i
saw
you
with
my
husband
at
the
harbour
you
were
wearing
expensive
brooches
and
bracelets
so
it
no
use
your
playing
the
innocent
lamb
to
me
i
ask
you
for
the
last
time
will
you
give
me
the
things
or
not
you
are
a
queer
one
upon
my
word
said
pasha
beginning
to
feel
offended
i
assure
you
that
except
the
bracelet
and
this
little
ring
i
never
seen
a
thing
from
your
nikolay
petrovitch
he
brings
me
nothing
but
sweet
cakes
sweet
cakes
laughed
the
stranger
at
home
the
children
have
nothing
to
eat
and
here
you
have
sweet
cakes
you
absolutely
refuse
to
restore
the
presents
receiving
no
answer
the
lady
sat
down
and
stared
into
space
pondering
what
to
be
done
now
she
said
if
i
do
get
nine
hundred
roubles
he
is
ruined
and
the
children
and
i
am
ruined
too
shall
i
kill
this
low
woman
or
go
down
on
my
knees
to
her
the
lady
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
and
broke
into
sobs
i
beg
you
pasha
heard
through
the
stranger
sobs
you
see
you
have
plundered
and
ruined
my
husband
save
him
you
have
no
feeling
for
him
but
the
children
the
children
what
have
the
children
done
pasha
imagined
little
children
standing
in
the
street
crying
with
hunger
and
she
too
sobbed
what
can
i
do
madam
she
said
you
say
that
i
am
a
low
woman
and
that
i
have
ruined
nikolay
petrovitch
and
i
assure
you
before
god
almighty
i
have
had
nothing
from
him
whatever
there
is
only
one
girl
in
our
chorus
who
has
a
rich
admirer
all
the
rest
of
us
live
from
hand
to
mouth
on
bread
and
kvass
nikolay
petrovitch
is
a
highly
educated
refined
gentleman
so
i
made
him
welcome
we
are
bound
to
make
gentlemen
welcome
i
ask
you
for
the
things
give
me
the
things
i
am
crying
i
am
humiliating
myself
if
you
like
i
will
go
down
on
my
knees
if
you
wish
it
pasha
shrieked
with
horror
and
waved
her
hands
she
felt
that
this
pale
beautiful
lady
who
expressed
herself
so
grandly
as
though
she
were
on
the
stage
really
might
go
down
on
her
knees
to
her
simply
from
pride
from
grandeur
to
exalt
herself
and
humiliate
the
chorus
girl
very
well
i
will
give
you
things
said
pasha
wiping
her
eyes
and
bustling
about
by
all
means
only
they
are
not
from
nikolay
petrovitch
i
got
these
from
other
gentlemen
as
you
please
pasha
pulled
out
the
upper
drawer
of
the
chest
took
out
a
diamond
brooch
a
coral
necklace
some
rings
and
bracelets
and
gave
them
all
to
the
lady
take
them
if
you
like
only
i
never
had
anything
from
your
husband
take
them
and
grow
rich
pasha
went
on
offended
at
the
threat
to
go
down
on
her
knees
and
if
you
are
a
lady
his
lawful
wife
you
should
keep
him
to
yourself
i
should
think
so
i
did
not
ask
him
to
come
he
came
of
himself
through
her
tears
the
lady
scrutinized
the
articles
given
her
and
said
this
is
everything
there
wo
be
five
hundred
worth
here
pasha
impulsively
flung
out
of
the
chest
a
gold
watch
a
and
studs
and
said
flinging
up
her
hands
i
nothing
else
left
you
can
search
the
visitor
gave
a
sigh
with
trembling
hands
twisted
the
things
up
in
her
handkerchief
and
went
out
without
uttering
a
word
without
even
nodding
her
head
the
door
from
the
next
room
opened
and
kolpakov
walked
in
he
was
pale
and
kept
shaking
his
head
nervously
as
though
he
had
swallowed
something
very
bitter
tears
were
glistening
in
his
eyes
what
presents
did
you
make
me
pasha
asked
pouncing
upon
him
when
did
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
presents
that
no
matter
said
kolpakov
and
he
tossed
his
head
my
god
she
cried
before
you
she
humbled
herself
i
am
asking
you
what
presents
did
you
make
me
pasha
cried
my
god
she
a
lady
so
proud
so
pure
she
was
ready
to
go
down
on
her
knees
to
to
this
wench
and
i
brought
her
to
this
i
allowed
it
he
clutched
his
head
in
his
hands
and
moaned
no
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
this
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
get
away
from
me
you
low
creature
he
cried
with
repulsion
backing
away
from
pasha
and
thrusting
her
off
with
trembling
hands
she
would
have
gone
down
on
her
knees
and
and
to
you
oh
my
god
he
rapidly
dressed
and
pushing
pasha
aside
contemptuously
made
for
the
door
and
went
out
pasha
lay
down
and
began
wailing
aloud
she
was
already
regretting
her
things
which
she
had
given
away
so
impulsively
and
her
feelings
were
hurt
she
remembered
how
three
years
ago
a
merchant
had
beaten
her
for
no
sort
of
reason
and
she
wailed
more
loudly
than
ever
verotchka
ivan
alexeyitch
ognev
remembers
how
on
that
august
evening
he
opened
the
glass
door
with
a
rattle
and
went
out
on
to
the
verandah
he
was
wearing
a
light
inverness
cape
and
a
straw
hat
the
very
one
that
was
lying
with
his
in
the
dust
under
his
bed
in
one
hand
he
had
a
big
bundle
of
books
and
notebooks
in
the
other
a
thick
knotted
stick
behind
the
door
holding
the
lamp
to
show
the
way
stood
the
master
of
the
house
kuznetsov
a
bald
old
man
with
a
long
grey
beard
in
a
piqué
jacket
the
old
man
was
smiling
cordially
and
nodding
his
head
old
fellow
said
ognev
kuznetsov
put
the
lamp
on
a
little
table
and
went
out
to
the
verandah
two
long
narrow
shadows
moved
down
the
steps
towards
the
swayed
to
and
fro
and
leaned
their
heads
on
the
trunks
of
the
and
once
more
thank
you
my
dear
fellow
said
ivan
alexeyitch
thank
you
for
your
welcome
for
your
kindness
for
your
affection
i
shall
never
forget
your
hospitality
as
long
as
i
live
you
are
so
good
and
your
daughter
is
so
good
and
everyone
here
is
so
kind
so
and
friendly
such
a
splendid
set
of
people
that
i
do
know
how
to
say
what
i
feel
from
excess
of
feeling
and
under
the
influence
of
the
wine
he
had
just
drunk
ognev
talked
in
a
singing
voice
like
a
divinity
student
and
was
so
touched
that
he
expressed
his
feelings
not
so
much
by
words
as
by
the
blinking
of
his
eyes
and
the
twitching
of
his
shoulders
kuznetsov
who
had
also
drunk
a
good
deal
and
was
touched
craned
forward
to
the
young
man
and
kissed
him
i
grown
as
fond
of
you
as
if
i
were
your
dog
ognev
went
on
i
been
turning
up
here
almost
every
day
i
stayed
the
night
a
dozen
times
it
dreadful
to
think
of
all
the
wine
i
drunk
and
thank
you
most
of
all
for
your
and
help
without
you
i
should
have
been
busy
here
over
my
statistics
till
october
i
shall
put
in
my
preface
think
it
my
duty
to
express
my
gratitude
to
the
president
of
the
district
zemstvo
of
n
kuznetsov
for
his
kind
there
is
a
brilliant
future
before
statistics
my
humble
respects
to
vera
gavrilovna
and
tell
the
doctors
both
the
lawyers
and
your
secretary
that
i
shall
never
forget
their
help
and
now
old
fellow
let
us
embrace
one
another
and
kiss
for
the
last
time
ognev
limp
with
emotion
kissed
the
old
man
once
more
and
began
going
down
the
steps
on
the
last
step
he
looked
round
and
asked
shall
we
meet
again
some
day
god
knows
said
the
old
man
most
likely
not
yes
that
true
nothing
will
tempt
you
to
petersburg
and
i
am
never
likely
to
turn
up
in
this
district
again
well
you
had
better
leave
the
books
behind
kuznetsov
called
after
him
you
do
want
to
drag
such
a
weight
with
you
i
would
send
them
by
a
servant
but
ognev
was
rapidly
walking
away
from
the
house
and
was
not
listening
his
heart
warmed
by
the
wine
was
brimming
over
with
friendliness
and
sadness
he
walked
along
thinking
how
frequently
one
met
with
good
people
and
what
a
pity
it
was
that
nothing
was
left
of
those
meetings
but
memories
at
times
one
catches
a
glimpse
of
cranes
on
the
horizon
and
a
faint
gust
of
wind
brings
their
plaintive
ecstatic
cry
and
a
minute
later
however
greedily
one
scans
the
blue
distance
one
can
not
see
a
speck
nor
catch
a
sound
and
like
that
people
with
their
faces
and
their
words
flit
through
our
lives
and
are
drowned
in
the
past
leaving
nothing
except
faint
traces
in
the
memory
having
been
in
the
n
district
from
the
early
spring
and
having
been
almost
every
day
at
the
friendly
kuznetsovs
ivan
alexeyitch
had
become
as
much
at
home
with
the
old
man
his
daughter
and
the
servants
as
though
they
were
his
own
people
he
had
grown
familiar
with
the
whole
house
to
the
smallest
detail
with
the
cosy
verandah
the
windings
of
the
avenues
the
silhouettes
of
the
trees
over
the
kitchen
and
the
but
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
gate
all
this
would
be
changed
to
memory
and
would
lose
its
meaning
as
reality
for
ever
and
in
a
year
or
two
all
these
dear
images
would
grow
as
dim
in
his
consciousness
as
stories
he
had
read
or
things
he
had
imagined
nothing
in
life
is
so
precious
as
people
ognev
thought
in
his
emotion
as
he
strode
along
the
avenue
to
the
gate
nothing
it
was
warm
and
still
in
the
garden
there
was
a
scent
of
the
mignonette
of
the
and
of
the
heliotrope
which
were
not
yet
over
in
the
the
spaces
between
the
bushes
and
the
were
filled
with
a
fine
soft
mist
soaked
through
and
through
with
moonlight
and
as
ognev
long
remembered
coils
of
mist
that
looked
like
phantoms
slowly
but
perceptibly
followed
one
another
across
the
avenue
the
moon
stood
high
above
the
garden
and
below
it
transparent
patches
of
mist
were
floating
eastward
the
whole
world
seemed
to
consist
of
nothing
but
black
silhouettes
and
wandering
white
shadows
ognev
seeing
the
mist
on
a
moonlight
august
evening
almost
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
imagined
he
was
seeing
not
nature
but
a
stage
effect
in
which
unskilful
workmen
trying
to
light
up
the
garden
with
white
bengal
fire
hid
behind
the
bushes
and
let
off
clouds
of
white
smoke
together
with
the
light
when
ognev
reached
the
garden
gate
a
dark
shadow
moved
away
from
the
low
fence
and
came
towards
him
vera
gavrilovna
he
said
delighted
you
here
and
i
have
been
looking
everywhere
for
you
wanted
to
say
i
am
going
away
so
early
why
it
only
eleven
yes
it
time
i
was
off
i
have
a
walk
and
then
my
packing
i
must
be
up
early
before
ognev
stood
kuznetsov
daughter
vera
a
girl
of
as
usual
melancholy
carelessly
dressed
and
attractive
girls
who
are
dreamy
and
spend
whole
days
lying
down
lazily
reading
whatever
they
come
across
who
are
bored
and
melancholy
are
usually
careless
in
their
dress
to
those
of
them
who
have
been
endowed
by
nature
with
taste
and
an
instinct
of
beauty
the
slight
carelessness
adds
a
special
charm
when
ognev
later
on
remembered
her
he
could
not
picture
pretty
verotchka
except
in
a
full
blouse
which
was
crumpled
in
deep
folds
at
the
belt
and
yet
did
not
touch
her
waist
without
her
hair
done
up
high
and
a
curl
that
had
come
loose
from
it
on
her
forehead
without
the
knitted
red
shawl
with
ball
fringe
at
the
edge
which
hung
disconsolately
on
vera
shoulders
in
the
evenings
like
a
flag
on
a
windless
day
and
in
the
daytime
lay
about
crushed
up
in
the
hall
near
the
men
hats
or
on
a
box
in
the
where
the
old
cat
did
not
hesitate
to
sleep
on
it
this
shawl
and
the
folds
of
her
blouse
suggested
a
feeling
of
freedom
and
laziness
of
and
sitting
at
home
perhaps
because
vera
attracted
ognev
he
saw
in
every
frill
and
button
something
warm
naïve
cosy
something
nice
and
poetical
just
what
is
lacking
in
cold
insincere
women
that
have
no
instinct
for
beauty
verotchka
had
a
good
figure
a
regular
profile
and
beautiful
curly
hair
ognev
who
had
seen
few
women
in
his
life
thought
her
a
beauty
i
am
going
away
he
said
as
he
took
leave
of
her
at
the
gate
do
remember
evil
against
me
thank
you
for
everything
in
the
same
singing
divinity
student
voice
in
which
he
had
talked
to
her
father
with
the
same
blinking
and
twitching
of
his
shoulders
he
began
thanking
vera
for
her
hospitality
kindness
and
friendliness
i
written
about
you
in
every
letter
to
my
mother
he
said
if
everyone
were
like
you
and
your
dad
what
a
jolly
place
the
world
would
be
you
are
such
a
splendid
set
of
people
all
such
genuine
friendly
people
with
no
nonsense
about
you
where
are
you
going
to
now
asked
vera
i
am
going
now
to
my
mother
at
oryol
i
shall
be
a
fortnight
with
her
and
then
back
to
petersburg
and
work
and
then
and
then
i
shall
work
all
the
winter
and
in
the
spring
go
somewhere
into
the
provinces
again
to
collect
material
well
be
happy
live
a
hundred
years
do
remember
evil
against
me
we
shall
not
see
each
other
again
ognev
stooped
down
and
kissed
vera
hand
then
in
silent
emotion
he
straightened
his
cape
shifted
his
bundle
of
books
to
a
more
comfortable
position
paused
and
said
what
a
lot
of
mist
yes
have
you
left
anything
behind
no
i
do
think
so
for
some
seconds
ognev
stood
in
silence
then
he
moved
clumsily
towards
the
gate
and
went
out
of
the
garden
stay
i
see
you
as
far
as
our
wood
said
vera
following
him
out
they
walked
along
the
road
now
the
trees
did
not
obscure
the
view
and
one
could
see
the
sky
and
the
distance
as
though
covered
with
a
veil
all
nature
was
hidden
in
a
transparent
colourless
haze
through
which
her
beauty
peeped
gaily
where
the
mist
was
thicker
and
whiter
it
lay
heaped
unevenly
about
the
stones
stalks
and
bushes
or
drifted
in
coils
over
the
road
clung
close
to
the
earth
and
seemed
trying
not
to
conceal
the
view
through
the
haze
they
could
see
all
the
road
as
far
as
the
wood
with
dark
ditches
at
the
sides
and
tiny
bushes
which
grew
in
the
ditches
and
caught
the
straying
wisps
of
mist
half
a
mile
from
the
gate
they
saw
the
dark
patch
of
kuznetsov
wood
why
has
she
come
with
me
i
shall
have
to
see
her
back
thought
ognev
but
looking
at
her
profile
he
gave
a
friendly
smile
and
said
one
does
want
to
go
away
in
such
lovely
weather
it
quite
a
romantic
evening
with
the
moon
the
stillness
and
all
the
etceteras
do
you
know
vera
gavrilovna
here
i
have
lived
years
in
the
world
and
never
had
a
romance
no
romantic
episode
in
my
whole
life
so
that
i
only
know
by
hearsay
of
rendezvous
of
sighs
and
kisses
it
not
normal
in
town
when
one
sits
in
one
lodgings
one
does
not
notice
the
blank
but
here
in
the
fresh
air
one
feels
it
one
resents
it
why
is
it
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
never
had
time
or
perhaps
it
was
i
have
never
met
women
who
in
fact
i
have
very
few
acquaintances
and
never
go
anywhere
for
some
three
hundred
paces
the
young
people
walked
on
in
silence
ognev
kept
glancing
at
verotchka
bare
head
and
shawl
and
days
of
spring
and
summer
rose
to
his
mind
one
after
another
it
had
been
a
period
when
far
from
his
grey
petersburg
lodgings
enjoying
the
friendly
warmth
of
kind
people
nature
and
the
work
he
loved
he
had
not
had
time
to
notice
how
the
sunsets
followed
the
glow
of
dawn
and
how
one
after
another
foretelling
the
end
of
summer
first
the
nightingale
ceased
singing
then
the
quail
then
a
little
later
the
landrail
the
days
slipped
by
unnoticed
so
that
life
must
have
been
happy
and
easy
he
began
calling
aloud
how
reluctantly
he
poor
and
unaccustomed
to
change
of
scene
and
society
had
come
at
the
end
of
april
to
the
n
district
where
he
had
expected
dreariness
loneliness
and
indifference
to
statistics
which
he
considered
was
now
the
foremost
among
the
sciences
when
he
arrived
on
an
april
morning
at
the
little
town
of
n
he
had
put
up
at
the
inn
kept
by
ryabuhin
the
old
believer
where
for
twenty
kopecks
a
day
they
had
given
him
a
light
clean
room
on
condition
that
he
should
not
smoke
indoors
after
resting
and
finding
who
was
the
president
of
the
district
zemstvo
he
had
set
off
at
once
on
foot
to
kuznetsov
he
had
to
walk
three
miles
through
lush
meadows
and
young
copses
larks
were
hovering
in
the
clouds
filling
the
air
with
silvery
notes
and
rooks
flapping
their
wings
with
sedate
dignity
floated
over
the
green
cornland
good
heavens
ognev
had
thought
in
wonder
can
it
be
that
always
air
like
this
to
breathe
here
or
is
this
scent
only
in
honour
of
my
coming
expecting
a
cold
reception
he
went
in
to
diffidently
looking
up
from
under
his
eyebrows
and
shyly
pulling
his
beard
at
first
kuznetsov
wrinkled
up
his
brows
and
could
not
understand
what
use
the
zemstvo
could
be
to
the
young
man
and
his
statistics
but
when
the
latter
explained
at
length
what
was
material
for
statistics
and
how
such
material
was
collected
kuznetsov
brightened
smiled
and
with
childish
curiosity
began
looking
at
his
notebooks
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
ivan
alexeyitch
was
already
sitting
at
supper
with
the
kuznetsovs
was
rapidly
becoming
exhilarated
by
their
strong
wine
and
looking
at
the
calm
faces
and
lazy
movements
of
his
new
acquaintances
felt
all
over
that
sweet
drowsy
indolence
which
makes
one
want
to
sleep
and
stretch
and
smile
while
his
new
acquaintances
looked
at
him
and
asked
him
whether
his
father
and
mother
were
living
how
much
he
earned
a
month
how
often
he
went
to
the
theatre
ognev
recalled
his
expeditions
about
the
neighbourhood
the
picnics
the
fishing
parties
the
visit
of
the
whole
party
to
the
convent
to
see
the
mother
superior
marfa
who
had
given
each
of
the
visitors
a
bead
purse
he
recalled
the
hot
endless
typically
russian
arguments
in
which
the
opponents
spluttering
and
banging
the
table
with
their
fists
misunderstand
and
interrupt
one
another
unconsciously
contradict
themselves
at
every
phrase
continually
change
the
subject
and
after
arguing
for
two
or
three
hours
laugh
and
say
goodness
knows
what
we
have
been
arguing
about
beginning
with
one
thing
and
going
on
to
another
and
do
you
remember
how
the
doctor
and
you
and
i
rode
to
shestovo
said
ivan
alexeyitch
to
vera
as
they
reached
the
copse
it
was
there
that
the
crazy
saint
met
us
i
gave
him
a
piece
and
he
crossed
himself
three
times
and
flung
it
into
the
rye
good
heavens
i
am
carrying
away
such
a
mass
of
memories
that
if
i
could
gather
them
together
into
a
whole
it
would
make
a
good
nugget
of
gold
i
do
understand
why
clever
perceptive
people
crowd
into
petersburg
and
moscow
and
do
come
here
is
there
more
truth
and
freedom
in
the
nevsky
and
in
the
big
damp
houses
than
here
really
the
idea
of
artists
scientific
men
and
journalists
all
living
crowded
together
in
furnished
rooms
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
mistake
twenty
paces
from
the
copse
the
road
was
crossed
by
a
small
narrow
bridge
with
posts
at
the
corners
which
had
always
served
as
a
for
the
kuznetsovs
and
their
guests
on
their
evening
walks
from
there
those
who
liked
could
mimic
the
forest
echo
and
one
could
see
the
road
vanish
in
the
dark
woodland
track
well
here
is
the
bridge
said
ognev
here
you
must
turn
back
vera
stopped
and
drew
a
breath
let
us
sit
down
she
said
sitting
down
on
one
of
the
posts
people
generally
sit
down
when
they
say
before
starting
on
a
journey
ognev
settled
himself
beside
her
on
his
bundle
of
books
and
went
on
talking
she
was
breathless
from
the
walk
and
was
looking
not
at
ivan
alexeyitch
but
away
into
the
distance
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
and
what
if
we
meet
in
ten
years
time
he
said
what
shall
we
be
like
then
you
will
be
by
then
the
respectable
mother
of
a
family
and
i
shall
be
the
author
of
some
weighty
statistical
work
of
no
use
to
anyone
as
thick
as
forty
thousand
such
works
we
shall
meet
and
think
of
old
days
now
we
are
conscious
of
the
present
it
absorbs
and
excites
us
but
when
we
meet
we
shall
not
remember
the
day
nor
the
month
nor
even
the
year
in
which
we
saw
each
other
for
the
last
time
on
this
bridge
you
will
be
changed
perhaps
tell
me
will
you
be
different
vera
started
and
turned
her
face
towards
him
what
she
asked
i
asked
you
just
now
excuse
me
i
did
not
hear
what
you
were
saying
only
then
ognev
noticed
a
change
in
vera
she
was
pale
breathing
fast
and
the
tremor
in
her
breathing
affected
her
hands
and
lips
and
head
and
not
one
curl
as
usual
but
two
came
loose
and
fell
on
her
forehead
evidently
she
avoided
looking
him
in
the
face
and
trying
to
mask
her
emotion
at
one
moment
fingered
her
collar
which
seemed
to
be
rasping
her
neck
at
another
pulled
her
red
shawl
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
i
am
afraid
you
are
cold
said
ognev
it
not
at
all
wise
to
sit
in
the
mist
let
me
see
you
back
vera
sat
mute
what
is
the
matter
asked
ognev
with
a
smile
you
sit
silent
and
do
answer
my
questions
are
you
cross
or
do
you
feel
well
vera
pressed
the
palm
of
her
hand
to
the
cheek
nearest
to
ognev
and
then
abruptly
jerked
it
away
an
awful
position
she
murmured
with
a
look
of
pain
on
her
face
awful
how
is
it
awful
asked
ognev
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
not
concealing
his
surprise
what
the
matter
still
breathing
hard
and
twitching
her
shoulders
vera
turned
her
back
to
him
looked
at
the
sky
for
half
a
minute
and
said
there
is
something
i
must
say
to
you
ivan
alexeyitch
i
am
listening
it
may
seem
strange
to
you
you
will
be
surprised
but
i
do
care
ognev
shrugged
his
shoulders
once
more
and
prepared
himself
to
listen
you
see
verotchka
began
bowing
her
head
and
fingering
a
ball
on
the
fringe
of
her
shawl
you
see
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
you
think
it
strange
and
silly
but
i
ca
bear
it
any
longer
vera
words
died
away
in
an
indistinct
mutter
and
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
tears
the
girl
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
bent
lower
than
ever
and
wept
bitterly
ivan
alexeyitch
cleared
his
throat
in
confusion
and
looked
about
him
hopelessly
at
his
end
not
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
being
unused
to
the
sight
of
tears
he
felt
his
own
eyes
too
beginning
to
smart
well
what
next
he
muttered
helplessly
vera
gavrilovna
this
for
i
should
like
to
know
my
dear
girl
are
you
are
you
ill
or
has
someone
been
nasty
to
you
tell
me
perhaps
i
could
so
to
say
help
you
when
trying
to
console
her
he
ventured
cautiously
to
remove
her
hands
from
her
face
she
smiled
at
him
through
her
tears
and
said
i
love
you
these
words
so
simple
and
ordinary
were
uttered
in
ordinary
human
language
but
ognev
in
acute
embarrassment
turned
away
from
vera
and
got
up
while
his
confusion
was
followed
by
terror
the
sad
warm
sentimental
mood
induced
by
and
the
wine
suddenly
vanished
and
gave
place
to
an
acute
and
unpleasant
feeling
of
awkwardness
he
felt
an
inward
revulsion
he
looked
askance
at
vera
and
now
that
by
declaring
her
love
for
him
she
had
cast
off
the
aloofness
which
so
adds
to
a
woman
charm
she
seemed
to
him
as
it
were
shorter
plainer
more
ordinary
what
the
meaning
of
it
he
thought
with
horror
but
i
do
i
love
her
or
not
that
the
question
and
she
breathed
easily
and
freely
now
that
the
worst
and
most
difficult
thing
was
said
she
too
got
up
and
looking
ivan
alexeyitch
straight
in
the
face
began
talking
rapidly
warmly
irrepressibly
as
a
man
suddenly
can
not
afterwards
remember
the
succession
of
sounds
accompanying
the
catastrophe
that
overwhelmed
him
so
ognev
can
not
remember
vera
words
and
phrases
he
can
only
recall
the
meaning
of
what
she
said
and
the
sensation
her
words
evoked
in
him
he
remembers
her
voice
which
seemed
stifled
and
husky
with
emotion
and
the
extraordinary
music
and
passion
of
her
intonation
laughing
crying
with
tears
glistening
on
her
eyelashes
she
told
him
that
from
the
first
day
of
their
acquaintance
he
had
struck
her
by
his
originality
his
intelligence
his
kind
intelligent
eyes
by
his
work
and
objects
in
life
that
she
loved
him
passionately
deeply
madly
that
when
coming
into
the
house
from
the
garden
in
the
summer
she
saw
his
cape
in
the
hall
or
heard
his
voice
in
the
distance
she
felt
a
cold
shudder
at
her
heart
a
foreboding
of
happiness
even
his
slightest
jokes
had
made
her
laugh
in
every
figure
in
his
she
saw
something
extraordinarily
wise
and
grand
his
knotted
stick
seemed
to
her
more
beautiful
than
the
trees
the
copse
and
the
wisps
of
mist
and
the
black
ditches
at
the
side
of
the
road
seemed
hushed
listening
to
her
whilst
something
strange
and
unpleasant
was
passing
in
ognev
heart
telling
him
of
her
love
vera
was
enchantingly
beautiful
she
spoke
eloquently
and
passionately
but
he
felt
neither
pleasure
nor
gladness
as
he
would
have
liked
to
he
felt
nothing
but
compassion
for
vera
pity
and
regret
that
a
good
girl
should
be
distressed
on
his
account
whether
he
was
affected
by
generalizations
from
reading
or
by
the
insuperable
habit
of
looking
at
things
objectively
which
so
often
hinders
people
from
living
but
vera
ecstasies
and
suffering
struck
him
as
affected
not
to
be
taken
seriously
and
at
the
same
time
rebellious
feeling
whispered
to
him
that
all
he
was
hearing
and
seeing
now
from
the
point
of
view
of
nature
and
personal
happiness
was
more
important
than
any
statistics
and
books
and
truths
and
he
raged
and
blamed
himself
though
he
did
not
understand
exactly
where
he
was
in
fault
to
complete
his
embarrassment
he
was
absolutely
at
a
loss
what
to
say
and
yet
something
he
must
say
to
say
bluntly
i
do
love
you
was
beyond
him
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
say
yes
because
however
much
he
rummaged
in
his
heart
he
could
not
find
one
spark
of
feeling
in
it
he
was
silent
and
she
meanwhile
was
saying
that
for
her
there
was
no
greater
happiness
than
to
see
him
to
follow
him
wherever
he
liked
this
very
moment
to
be
his
wife
and
helper
and
that
if
he
went
away
from
her
she
would
die
of
misery
i
can
not
stay
here
she
said
wringing
her
hands
i
am
sick
of
the
house
and
this
wood
and
the
air
i
can
not
bear
the
everlasting
peace
and
aimless
life
i
ca
endure
our
colourless
pale
people
who
are
all
as
like
one
another
as
two
drops
of
water
they
are
all
and
because
they
are
all
and
know
nothing
of
struggle
or
suffering
i
want
to
be
in
those
big
damp
houses
where
people
suffer
embittered
by
work
and
need
and
this
too
seemed
to
ognev
affected
and
not
to
be
taken
seriously
when
vera
had
finished
he
still
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
silent
and
he
muttered
vera
gavrilovna
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
though
i
feel
done
nothing
to
deserve
such
feeling
on
your
part
besides
as
an
honest
man
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
happiness
depends
on
equality
that
is
when
both
parties
are
equally
in
love
but
he
was
immediately
ashamed
of
his
mutterings
and
ceased
he
felt
that
his
face
at
that
moment
looked
stupid
guilty
blank
that
it
was
strained
and
affected
vera
must
have
been
able
to
read
the
truth
on
his
countenance
for
she
suddenly
became
grave
turned
pale
and
bent
her
head
you
must
forgive
me
ognev
muttered
not
able
to
endure
the
silence
i
respect
you
so
much
that
it
pains
me
vera
turned
sharply
and
walked
rapidly
homewards
ognev
followed
her
no
do
said
vera
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
do
come
i
can
go
alone
oh
yes
i
must
see
you
home
anyway
whatever
ognev
said
it
all
to
the
last
word
struck
him
as
loathsome
and
flat
the
feeling
of
guilt
grew
greater
at
every
step
he
raged
inwardly
clenched
his
fists
and
cursed
his
coldness
and
his
stupidity
with
women
trying
to
stir
his
feelings
he
looked
at
verotchka
beautiful
figure
at
her
hair
and
the
traces
of
her
little
feet
on
the
dusty
road
he
remembered
her
words
and
her
tears
but
all
that
only
touched
his
heart
and
did
not
quicken
his
pulse
ach
one
ca
force
oneself
to
love
he
assured
himself
and
at
the
same
time
he
thought
but
shall
i
ever
fall
in
love
without
i
am
nearly
thirty
i
have
never
met
anyone
better
than
vera
and
i
never
shall
oh
this
premature
old
age
old
age
at
thirty
vera
walked
on
in
front
more
and
more
rapidly
without
looking
back
at
him
or
raising
her
head
it
seemed
to
him
that
sorrow
had
made
her
thinner
and
narrower
in
the
shoulders
i
can
imagine
what
going
on
in
her
heart
now
he
thought
looking
at
her
back
she
must
be
ready
to
die
with
shame
and
mortification
my
god
there
so
much
life
poetry
and
meaning
in
it
that
it
would
move
a
stone
and
i
i
am
stupid
and
absurd
at
the
gate
vera
stole
a
glance
at
him
and
shrugging
and
wrapping
her
shawl
round
her
walked
rapidly
away
down
the
avenue
ivan
alexeyitch
was
left
alone
going
back
to
the
copse
he
walked
slowly
continually
standing
still
and
looking
round
at
the
gate
with
an
expression
in
his
whole
figure
that
suggested
that
he
could
not
believe
his
own
memory
he
looked
for
vera
footprints
on
the
road
and
could
not
believe
that
the
girl
who
had
so
attracted
him
had
just
declared
her
love
and
that
he
had
so
clumsily
and
bluntly
refused
her
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
was
his
lot
to
learn
by
experience
how
little
that
a
man
does
depends
on
his
own
will
and
to
suffer
in
his
own
person
the
feelings
of
a
decent
kindly
man
who
has
against
his
will
caused
his
neighbour
cruel
undeserved
anguish
his
conscience
tormented
him
and
when
vera
disappeared
he
felt
as
though
he
had
lost
something
very
precious
something
very
near
and
dear
which
he
could
never
find
again
he
felt
that
with
vera
a
part
of
his
youth
had
slipped
away
from
him
and
that
the
moments
which
he
had
passed
through
so
fruitlessly
would
never
be
repeated
when
he
reached
the
bridge
he
stopped
and
sank
into
thought
he
wanted
to
discover
the
reason
of
his
strange
coldness
that
it
was
due
to
something
within
him
and
not
outside
himself
was
clear
to
him
he
frankly
acknowledged
to
himself
that
it
was
not
the
intellectual
coldness
of
which
clever
people
so
often
boast
not
the
coldness
of
a
conceited
fool
but
simply
impotence
of
soul
incapacity
for
being
moved
by
beauty
premature
old
age
brought
on
by
education
his
casual
existence
struggling
for
a
livelihood
his
homeless
life
in
lodgings
from
the
bridge
he
walked
slowly
as
it
were
reluctantly
into
the
wood
here
where
in
the
dense
black
darkness
glaring
patches
of
moonlight
gleamed
here
and
there
where
he
felt
nothing
except
his
thoughts
he
longed
passionately
to
regain
what
he
had
lost
and
ivan
alexeyitch
remembers
that
he
went
back
again
urging
himself
on
with
his
memories
forcing
himself
to
picture
vera
he
strode
rapidly
towards
the
garden
there
was
no
mist
by
then
along
the
road
or
in
the
garden
and
the
bright
moon
looked
down
from
the
sky
as
though
it
had
just
been
washed
only
the
eastern
sky
was
dark
and
misty
ognev
remembers
his
cautious
steps
the
dark
windows
the
heavy
scent
of
heliotrope
and
mignonette
his
old
friend
karo
wagging
his
tail
amicably
came
up
to
him
and
sniffed
his
hand
this
was
the
one
living
creature
who
saw
him
walk
two
or
three
times
round
the
house
stand
near
vera
dark
window
and
with
a
deep
sigh
and
a
wave
of
his
hand
walk
out
of
the
garden
an
hour
later
he
was
in
the
town
and
worn
out
and
exhausted
leaned
his
body
and
hot
face
against
the
gatepost
of
the
inn
as
he
knocked
at
the
gate
somewhere
in
the
town
a
dog
barked
sleepily
and
as
though
in
response
to
his
knock
someone
clanged
the
hour
on
an
iron
plate
near
the
church
you
prowl
about
at
night
grumbled
his
host
the
old
believer
opening
the
door
to
him
in
a
long
nightgown
like
a
woman
you
had
better
be
saying
your
prayers
instead
of
prowling
about
when
ivan
alexeyitch
reached
his
room
he
sank
on
the
bed
and
gazed
a
long
long
time
at
the
light
then
he
tossed
his
head
and
began
packing
my
life
the
story
of
a
provincial
i
the
superintendent
said
to
me
i
only
keep
you
out
of
regard
for
your
worthy
father
but
for
that
you
would
have
been
sent
flying
long
ago
i
replied
to
him
you
flatter
me
too
much
your
excellency
in
assuming
that
i
am
capable
of
flying
and
then
i
heard
him
say
take
that
gentleman
away
he
gets
upon
my
nerves
two
days
later
i
was
dismissed
and
in
this
way
i
have
during
the
years
i
have
been
regarded
as
grown
up
lost
nine
situations
to
the
great
mortification
of
my
father
the
architect
of
our
town
i
have
served
in
various
departments
but
all
these
nine
jobs
have
been
as
alike
as
one
drop
of
water
is
to
another
i
had
to
sit
write
listen
to
rude
or
stupid
observations
and
go
on
doing
so
till
i
was
dismissed
when
i
came
in
to
my
father
he
was
sitting
buried
in
a
low
with
his
eyes
closed
his
dry
emaciated
face
with
a
shade
of
dark
blue
where
it
was
shaved
he
looked
like
an
old
catholic
organist
expressed
meekness
and
resignation
without
responding
to
my
greeting
or
opening
his
eyes
he
said
if
my
dear
wife
and
your
mother
were
living
your
life
would
have
been
a
source
of
continual
distress
to
her
i
see
the
divine
providence
in
her
premature
death
i
beg
you
unhappy
boy
he
continued
opening
his
eyes
tell
me
what
am
i
to
do
with
you
in
the
past
when
i
was
younger
my
friends
and
relations
had
known
what
to
do
with
me
some
of
them
used
to
advise
me
to
volunteer
for
the
army
others
to
get
a
job
in
a
pharmacy
and
others
in
the
telegraph
department
now
that
i
am
over
that
grey
hairs
are
beginning
to
show
on
my
temples
and
that
i
have
been
already
in
the
army
and
in
a
pharmacy
and
in
the
telegraph
department
it
would
seem
that
all
earthly
possibilities
have
been
exhausted
and
people
have
given
up
advising
me
and
merely
sigh
or
shake
their
heads
what
do
you
think
about
yourself
my
father
went
on
by
the
time
they
are
your
age
young
men
have
a
secure
social
position
while
look
at
you
you
are
a
proletarian
a
beggar
a
burden
on
your
father
and
as
usual
he
proceeded
to
declare
that
the
young
people
of
were
on
the
road
to
perdition
through
infidelity
materialism
and
and
that
amateur
theatricals
ought
to
be
prohibited
because
they
seduced
young
people
from
religion
and
their
duties
we
shall
go
together
and
you
shall
apologize
to
the
superintendent
and
promise
him
to
work
conscientiously
he
said
in
conclusion
you
ought
not
to
remain
one
single
day
with
no
regular
position
in
society
i
beg
you
to
listen
to
me
i
said
sullenly
expecting
nothing
good
from
this
conversation
what
you
call
a
position
in
society
is
the
privilege
of
capital
and
education
those
who
have
neither
wealth
nor
education
earn
their
daily
bread
by
manual
labour
and
i
see
no
grounds
for
my
being
an
exception
when
you
begin
talking
about
manual
labour
it
is
always
stupid
and
vulgar
said
my
father
with
irritation
understand
you
dense
fellow
understand
you
that
besides
coarse
physical
strength
you
have
the
divine
spirit
a
spark
of
the
holy
fire
which
distinguishes
you
in
the
most
striking
way
from
the
ass
or
the
reptile
and
brings
you
nearer
to
the
deity
this
fire
is
the
fruit
of
the
efforts
of
the
best
of
mankind
during
thousands
of
years
your
poloznev
the
general
fought
at
borodino
your
grandfather
was
a
poet
an
orator
and
a
marshal
of
nobility
your
uncle
is
a
schoolmaster
and
lastly
i
your
father
am
an
architect
all
the
poloznevs
have
guarded
the
sacred
fire
for
you
to
put
it
out
one
must
be
just
i
said
millions
of
people
put
up
with
manual
labour
and
let
them
put
up
with
it
they
do
know
how
to
do
anything
else
anybody
even
the
most
abject
fool
or
criminal
is
capable
of
manual
labour
such
labour
is
the
distinguishing
mark
of
the
slave
and
the
barbarian
while
the
holy
fire
is
vouchsafed
only
to
a
few
to
continue
this
conversation
was
unprofitable
my
father
worshipped
himself
and
nothing
was
convincing
to
him
but
what
he
said
himself
besides
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
disdain
with
which
he
talked
of
physical
toil
was
founded
not
so
much
on
reverence
for
the
sacred
fire
as
on
a
secret
dread
that
i
should
become
a
workman
and
should
set
the
whole
town
talking
about
me
what
was
worse
all
my
contemporaries
had
long
ago
taken
their
degrees
and
were
getting
on
well
and
the
son
of
the
manager
of
the
state
bank
was
already
a
collegiate
assessor
while
i
his
only
son
was
nothing
to
continue
the
conversation
was
unprofitable
and
unpleasant
but
i
still
sat
on
and
feebly
retorted
hoping
that
i
might
at
last
be
understood
the
whole
question
of
course
was
clear
and
simple
and
only
concerned
with
the
means
of
my
earning
my
living
but
the
simplicity
of
it
was
not
seen
and
i
was
talked
to
in
mawkishly
rounded
phrases
of
borodino
of
the
sacred
fire
of
my
uncle
a
forgotten
poet
who
had
once
written
poor
and
artificial
verses
i
was
rudely
called
an
addlepate
and
a
dense
fellow
and
how
i
longed
to
be
understood
in
spite
of
everything
i
loved
my
father
and
my
sister
and
it
had
been
my
habit
from
childhood
to
consult
them
a
habit
so
deeply
rooted
that
i
doubt
whether
i
could
ever
have
got
rid
of
it
whether
i
were
in
the
right
or
the
wrong
i
was
in
constant
dread
of
wounding
them
constantly
afraid
that
my
thin
neck
would
turn
crimson
and
that
he
would
have
a
stroke
to
sit
in
a
stuffy
room
i
began
to
copy
to
compete
with
a
typewriter
is
shameful
and
humiliating
for
a
man
of
my
age
what
can
the
sacred
fire
have
to
do
with
it
it
intellectual
work
anyway
said
my
father
but
that
enough
let
us
cut
short
this
conversation
and
in
any
case
i
warn
you
if
you
do
go
back
to
your
work
again
but
follow
your
contemptible
propensities
then
my
daughter
and
i
will
banish
you
from
our
hearts
i
shall
strike
you
out
of
my
will
i
swear
by
the
living
god
with
perfect
sincerity
to
prove
the
purity
of
the
motives
by
which
i
wanted
to
be
guided
in
all
my
doings
i
said
the
question
of
inheritance
does
not
seem
very
important
to
me
i
shall
renounce
it
all
beforehand
for
some
reason
or
other
quite
to
my
surprise
these
words
were
deeply
resented
by
my
father
he
turned
crimson
do
dare
to
talk
to
me
like
that
stupid
he
shouted
in
a
thin
shrill
voice
wastrel
and
with
a
rapid
skilful
and
habitual
movement
he
slapped
me
twice
in
the
face
you
are
forgetting
yourself
when
my
father
beat
me
as
a
child
i
had
to
stand
up
straight
with
my
hands
held
stiffly
to
my
trouser
seams
and
look
him
straight
in
the
face
and
now
when
he
hit
me
i
was
utterly
overwhelmed
and
as
though
i
were
still
a
child
drew
myself
up
and
tried
to
look
him
in
the
face
my
father
was
old
and
very
thin
but
his
delicate
muscles
must
have
been
as
strong
as
leather
for
his
blows
hurt
a
good
deal
i
staggered
back
into
the
passage
and
there
he
snatched
up
his
umbrella
and
with
it
hit
me
several
times
on
the
head
and
shoulders
at
that
moment
my
sister
opened
the
door
to
find
out
what
the
noise
was
but
at
once
turned
away
with
a
look
of
horror
and
pity
without
uttering
a
word
in
my
defence
my
determination
not
to
return
to
the
government
office
but
to
begin
a
new
life
of
toil
was
not
to
be
shaken
all
that
was
left
for
me
to
do
was
to
fix
upon
the
special
employment
and
there
was
no
particular
difficulty
about
that
as
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
very
strong
and
fitted
for
the
very
heaviest
labour
i
was
faced
with
a
monotonous
life
of
toil
in
the
midst
of
hunger
coarseness
and
stench
continually
preoccupied
with
earning
my
daily
bread
and
who
knows
as
i
returned
from
my
work
along
great
dvoryansky
street
i
might
very
likely
envy
dolzhikov
the
engineer
who
lived
by
intellectual
work
but
at
the
moment
thinking
over
all
my
future
hardships
made
me
at
times
i
had
dreamed
of
spiritual
activity
imagining
myself
a
teacher
a
doctor
or
a
writer
but
these
dreams
remained
dreams
the
taste
for
intellectual
pleasures
for
the
theatre
for
instance
and
for
reading
was
a
passion
with
me
but
whether
i
had
any
ability
for
intellectual
work
i
do
know
at
school
i
had
had
an
unconquerable
aversion
for
greek
so
that
i
was
only
in
the
fourth
class
when
they
had
to
take
me
from
school
for
a
long
while
i
had
coaches
preparing
me
for
the
fifth
class
then
i
served
in
various
government
offices
spending
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
complete
idleness
and
i
was
told
that
was
intellectual
work
my
activity
in
the
scholastic
and
official
sphere
had
required
neither
mental
application
nor
talent
nor
special
qualifications
nor
creative
impulse
it
was
mechanical
such
intellectual
work
i
put
on
a
lower
level
than
physical
toil
i
despise
it
and
i
do
think
that
for
one
moment
it
could
serve
as
a
justification
for
an
idle
careless
life
as
it
is
indeed
nothing
but
a
sham
one
of
the
forms
of
that
same
idleness
real
intellectual
work
i
have
in
all
probability
never
known
evening
came
on
we
lived
in
great
dvoryansky
street
it
was
the
principal
street
in
the
town
and
in
the
absence
of
decent
public
gardens
our
used
to
use
it
as
a
promenade
in
the
evenings
this
charming
street
did
to
some
extent
take
the
place
of
a
public
garden
as
on
each
side
of
it
there
was
a
row
of
poplars
which
smelt
sweet
particularly
after
rain
and
acacias
tall
bushes
of
lilac
and
hung
over
the
fences
and
palings
the
may
twilight
the
tender
young
greenery
with
its
shifting
shades
the
scent
of
the
lilac
the
buzzing
of
the
insects
the
stillness
the
warmth
how
fresh
and
marvellous
it
all
is
though
spring
is
repeated
every
year
i
stood
at
the
garden
gate
and
watched
the
with
most
of
them
i
had
grown
up
and
at
one
time
played
pranks
now
they
might
have
been
disconcerted
by
my
being
near
them
for
i
was
poorly
and
unfashionably
dressed
and
they
used
to
say
of
my
very
narrow
trousers
and
huge
clumsy
boots
that
they
were
like
sticks
of
macaroni
stuck
in
boats
besides
i
had
a
bad
reputation
in
the
town
because
i
had
no
decent
social
position
and
used
often
to
play
billiards
in
cheap
taverns
and
also
perhaps
because
i
had
on
two
occasions
been
hauled
up
before
an
officer
of
the
police
though
i
had
done
nothing
whatever
to
account
for
this
in
the
big
house
opposite
someone
was
playing
the
piano
at
dolzhikov
it
was
beginning
to
get
dark
and
stars
were
twinkling
in
the
sky
here
my
father
in
an
old
with
wide
upturned
brim
walked
slowly
by
with
my
sister
on
his
arm
bowing
in
response
to
greetings
look
up
he
said
to
my
sister
pointing
to
the
sky
with
the
same
umbrella
with
which
he
had
beaten
me
that
afternoon
look
up
at
the
sky
even
the
tiniest
stars
are
all
worlds
how
insignificant
is
man
in
comparison
with
the
universe
and
he
said
this
in
a
tone
that
suggested
that
it
was
particularly
agreeable
and
flattering
to
him
that
he
was
so
insignificant
how
absolutely
devoid
of
talent
and
imagination
he
was
sad
to
say
he
was
the
only
architect
in
the
town
and
in
the
fifteen
to
twenty
years
that
i
could
remember
not
one
single
decent
house
had
been
built
in
it
when
any
one
asked
him
to
plan
a
house
he
usually
drew
first
the
reception
hall
and
just
as
in
old
days
the
misses
always
started
from
the
stove
when
they
danced
so
his
artistic
ideas
could
only
begin
and
develop
from
the
hall
and
to
them
he
tacked
on
a
a
nursery
a
study
linking
the
rooms
together
with
doors
and
so
they
all
inevitably
turned
into
passages
and
every
one
of
them
had
two
or
even
three
unnecessary
doors
his
imagination
must
have
been
lacking
in
clearness
extremely
muddled
curtailed
as
though
feeling
that
something
was
lacking
he
invariably
had
recourse
to
all
sorts
of
outbuildings
planting
one
beside
another
and
i
can
see
now
the
narrow
entries
the
poky
little
passages
the
crooked
staircases
leading
to
where
one
could
not
stand
upright
and
where
instead
of
a
floor
there
were
three
huge
steps
like
the
shelves
of
a
and
the
kitchen
was
invariably
in
the
basement
with
a
brick
floor
and
vaulted
ceilings
the
front
of
the
house
had
a
harsh
stubborn
expression
the
lines
of
it
were
stiff
and
timid
the
roof
was
and
as
it
were
squashed
down
and
the
fat
chimneys
were
invariably
crowned
by
wire
caps
with
squeaking
black
cowls
and
for
some
reason
all
these
houses
built
by
my
father
exactly
like
one
another
vaguely
reminded
me
of
his
and
the
back
of
his
head
stiff
and
in
the
course
of
years
they
have
grown
used
in
the
town
to
the
poverty
of
my
father
imagination
it
has
taken
root
and
become
our
local
style
this
same
style
my
father
had
brought
into
my
sister
life
also
beginning
with
christening
her
kleopatra
just
as
he
had
named
me
misail
when
she
was
a
little
girl
he
scared
her
by
references
to
the
stars
to
the
sages
of
ancient
times
to
our
ancestors
and
discoursed
at
length
on
the
nature
of
life
and
duty
and
now
when
she
was
he
kept
up
the
same
habits
allowing
her
to
walk
arm
in
arm
with
no
one
but
himself
and
imagining
for
some
reason
that
sooner
or
later
a
suitable
young
man
would
be
sure
to
appear
and
to
desire
to
enter
into
matrimony
with
her
from
respect
for
his
personal
qualities
she
adored
my
father
feared
him
and
believed
in
his
exceptional
intelligence
it
was
quite
dark
and
gradually
the
street
grew
empty
the
music
had
ceased
in
the
house
opposite
the
gate
was
thrown
wide
open
and
a
team
with
three
horses
trotted
frolicking
along
our
street
with
a
soft
tinkle
of
little
bells
that
was
the
engineer
going
for
a
drive
with
his
daughter
it
was
bedtime
i
had
my
own
room
in
the
house
but
i
lived
in
a
shed
in
the
yard
under
the
same
roof
as
a
brick
barn
which
had
been
built
some
time
or
other
probably
to
keep
harness
in
great
hooks
were
driven
into
the
wall
now
it
was
not
wanted
and
for
the
last
thirty
years
my
father
had
stowed
away
in
it
his
newspapers
which
for
some
reason
he
had
bound
in
volumes
and
allowed
nobody
to
touch
living
here
i
was
less
liable
to
be
seen
by
my
father
and
his
visitors
and
i
fancied
that
if
i
did
not
live
in
a
real
room
and
did
not
go
into
the
house
every
day
to
dinner
my
father
words
that
i
was
a
burden
upon
him
did
not
sound
so
offensive
my
sister
was
waiting
for
me
unseen
by
my
father
she
had
brought
me
some
supper
not
a
very
large
slice
of
cold
veal
and
a
piece
of
bread
in
our
house
such
sayings
as
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
gained
and
take
care
of
the
pence
and
the
pounds
will
take
care
of
themselves
and
so
on
were
frequently
repeated
and
my
sister
weighed
down
by
these
vulgar
maxims
did
her
utmost
to
cut
down
the
expenses
and
so
we
fared
badly
putting
the
plate
on
the
table
she
sat
down
on
my
bed
and
began
to
cry
misail
she
said
what
a
way
to
treat
us
she
did
not
cover
her
face
her
tears
dropped
on
her
bosom
and
hands
and
there
was
a
look
of
distress
on
her
face
she
fell
back
on
the
pillow
and
abandoned
herself
to
her
tears
sobbing
and
quivering
all
over
you
have
left
the
service
again
she
articulated
oh
how
awful
it
is
but
do
understand
sister
do
understand
i
said
and
i
was
overcome
with
despair
because
she
was
crying
as
would
have
it
the
kerosene
in
my
little
lamp
was
exhausted
it
began
to
smoke
and
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
and
the
old
hooks
on
the
walls
looked
down
sullenly
and
their
shadows
flickered
have
mercy
on
us
said
my
sister
sitting
up
father
is
in
terrible
distress
and
i
am
ill
i
shall
go
out
of
my
mind
what
will
become
of
you
she
said
sobbing
and
stretching
out
her
arms
to
me
i
beg
you
i
implore
you
for
our
dear
mother
sake
i
beg
you
to
go
back
to
the
office
i
ca
kleopatra
i
said
feeling
that
a
little
more
and
i
should
give
way
i
can
not
why
not
my
sister
went
on
why
not
well
if
you
ca
get
on
with
the
head
look
out
for
another
post
why
should
you
get
a
situation
on
the
railway
for
instance
i
have
just
been
talking
to
anyuta
blagovo
she
declares
they
would
take
you
on
the
and
even
promised
to
try
and
get
a
post
for
you
for
god
sake
misail
think
a
little
think
a
little
i
implore
you
we
talked
a
little
longer
and
i
gave
way
i
said
that
the
thought
of
a
job
on
the
railway
that
was
being
constructed
had
never
occurred
to
me
and
that
if
she
liked
i
was
ready
to
try
it
she
smiled
joyfully
through
her
tears
and
squeezed
my
hand
and
then
went
on
crying
because
she
could
not
stop
while
i
went
to
the
kitchen
for
some
kerosene
ii
among
the
devoted
supporters
of
amateur
theatricals
concerts
and
for
charitable
objects
the
azhogins
who
lived
in
their
own
house
in
great
dvoryansky
street
took
a
foremost
place
they
always
provided
the
room
and
took
upon
themselves
all
the
troublesome
arrangements
and
the
expenses
they
were
a
family
of
wealthy
landowners
who
had
an
estate
of
some
nine
thousand
acres
in
the
district
and
a
capital
house
but
they
did
not
care
for
the
country
and
lived
winter
and
summer
alike
in
the
town
the
family
consisted
of
the
mother
a
tall
spare
refined
lady
with
short
hair
a
short
jacket
and
a
skirt
in
the
english
fashion
and
three
daughters
who
when
they
were
spoken
of
were
called
not
by
their
names
but
simply
the
eldest
the
middle
and
the
youngest
they
all
had
ugly
sharp
chins
and
were
and
they
were
dressed
like
their
mother
they
lisped
disagreeably
and
yet
in
spite
of
that
infallibly
took
part
in
every
performance
and
were
continually
doing
something
with
a
charitable
object
acting
reciting
singing
they
were
very
serious
and
never
smiled
and
even
in
a
musical
comedy
they
played
without
the
faintest
trace
of
gaiety
with
a
businesslike
air
as
though
they
were
engaged
in
bookkeeping
i
loved
our
theatricals
especially
the
numerous
noisy
and
rather
incoherent
rehearsals
after
which
they
always
gave
a
supper
in
the
choice
of
the
plays
and
the
distribution
of
the
parts
i
had
no
hand
at
all
the
post
assigned
to
me
lay
behind
the
scenes
i
painted
the
scenes
copied
out
the
parts
prompted
made
up
the
faces
and
i
was
entrusted
too
with
various
stage
effects
such
as
thunder
the
singing
of
nightingales
and
so
on
since
i
had
no
proper
social
position
and
no
decent
clothes
at
the
rehearsals
i
held
aloof
from
the
rest
in
the
shadows
of
the
wings
and
maintained
a
shy
silence
i
painted
the
scenes
at
the
azhogins
either
in
the
barn
or
in
the
yard
i
was
assisted
by
andrey
ivanov
a
house
painter
or
as
he
called
himself
a
contractor
for
all
kinds
of
house
decorations
a
tall
very
thin
pale
man
of
fifty
with
a
hollow
chest
with
sunken
temples
with
blue
rings
round
his
eyes
rather
terrible
to
look
at
in
fact
he
was
afflicted
with
some
internal
malady
and
every
autumn
and
spring
people
said
that
he
would
recover
but
after
being
laid
up
for
a
while
he
would
get
up
and
say
afterwards
with
surprise
i
have
escaped
dying
again
in
the
town
he
was
called
radish
and
they
declared
that
this
was
his
real
name
he
was
as
fond
of
the
theatre
as
i
was
and
as
soon
as
rumours
reached
him
that
a
performance
was
being
got
up
he
threw
aside
all
his
work
and
went
to
the
azhogins
to
paint
scenes
the
day
after
my
talk
with
my
sister
i
was
working
at
the
from
morning
till
night
the
rehearsal
was
fixed
for
seven
in
the
evening
and
an
hour
before
it
began
all
the
amateurs
were
gathered
together
in
the
hall
and
the
eldest
the
middle
and
the
youngest
azhogins
were
pacing
about
the
stage
reading
from
manuscript
books
radish
in
a
long
overcoat
and
a
scarf
muffled
round
his
neck
already
stood
leaning
with
his
head
against
the
wall
gazing
with
a
devout
expression
at
the
stage
madame
azhogin
went
up
first
to
one
and
then
to
another
guest
saying
something
agreeable
to
each
she
had
a
way
of
gazing
into
one
face
and
speaking
softly
as
though
telling
a
secret
it
must
be
difficult
to
paint
scenery
she
said
softly
coming
up
to
me
i
was
just
talking
to
madame
mufke
about
superstitions
when
i
saw
you
come
in
my
goodness
my
whole
life
i
have
been
waging
war
against
superstitions
to
convince
the
servants
what
nonsense
all
their
terrors
are
i
always
light
three
candles
and
begin
all
my
important
undertakings
on
the
thirteenth
of
the
month
dolzhikov
daughter
came
in
a
plump
fair
beauty
dressed
as
people
said
in
everything
from
paris
she
did
not
act
but
a
chair
was
set
for
her
on
the
stage
at
the
rehearsals
and
the
performances
never
began
till
she
had
appeared
in
the
front
row
dazzling
and
astounding
everyone
with
her
fine
clothes
as
a
product
of
the
capital
she
was
allowed
to
make
remarks
during
the
rehearsals
and
she
did
so
with
a
sweet
indulgent
smile
and
one
could
see
that
she
looked
upon
our
performance
as
a
childish
amusement
it
was
said
she
had
studied
singing
at
the
petersburg
conservatoire
and
even
sang
for
a
whole
winter
in
a
private
opera
i
thought
her
very
charming
and
i
usually
watched
her
through
the
rehearsals
and
performances
without
taking
my
eyes
off
her
i
had
just
picked
up
the
manuscript
book
to
begin
prompting
when
my
sister
suddenly
made
her
appearance
without
taking
off
her
cloak
or
hat
she
came
up
to
me
and
said
come
along
i
beg
you
i
went
with
her
anyuta
blagovo
also
in
her
hat
and
wearing
a
dark
veil
was
standing
behind
the
scenes
at
the
door
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
assistant
president
of
the
court
who
had
held
that
office
in
our
town
almost
ever
since
the
establishment
of
the
circuit
court
since
she
was
tall
and
had
a
good
figure
her
assistance
was
considered
indispensable
for
and
when
she
represented
a
fairy
or
something
like
glory
her
face
burned
with
shame
but
she
took
no
part
in
dramatic
performances
and
came
to
the
rehearsals
only
for
a
moment
on
some
special
errand
and
did
not
go
into
the
hall
now
too
it
was
evident
that
she
had
only
looked
in
for
a
minute
my
father
was
speaking
about
you
she
said
drily
blushing
and
not
looking
at
me
dolzhikov
has
promised
you
a
post
on
the
apply
to
him
he
will
be
at
home
i
bowed
and
thanked
her
for
the
trouble
she
had
taken
and
you
can
give
up
this
she
said
indicating
the
exercise
book
my
sister
and
she
went
up
to
madame
azhogin
and
for
two
minutes
they
were
whispering
with
her
looking
towards
me
they
were
consulting
about
something
yes
indeed
said
madame
azhogin
softly
coming
up
to
me
and
looking
intently
into
my
face
yes
indeed
if
this
distracts
you
from
serious
pursuits
she
took
the
manuscript
book
from
my
hands
you
can
hand
it
over
to
someone
else
do
distress
yourself
my
friend
go
home
and
good
luck
to
you
i
said
to
her
and
went
away
overcome
with
confusion
as
i
went
down
the
stairs
i
saw
my
sister
and
anyuta
blagovo
going
away
they
were
hastening
along
talking
eagerly
about
something
probably
about
my
going
into
the
railway
service
my
sister
had
never
been
at
a
rehearsal
before
and
now
she
was
most
likely
and
afraid
her
father
might
find
out
that
without
his
permission
she
had
been
to
the
azhogins
i
went
to
dolzhikov
next
day
between
twelve
and
one
the
footman
conducted
me
into
a
very
beautiful
room
which
was
the
and
at
the
same
time
his
working
study
everything
here
was
soft
and
elegant
and
for
a
man
so
unaccustomed
to
luxury
as
i
was
it
seemed
strange
there
were
costly
rugs
huge
bronzes
pictures
gold
and
plush
frames
among
the
photographs
scattered
about
the
walls
there
were
very
beautiful
women
clever
lovely
faces
easy
attitudes
from
the
there
was
a
door
leading
straight
into
the
garden
on
to
a
verandah
one
could
see
one
could
see
a
table
laid
for
lunch
a
number
of
bottles
a
bouquet
of
roses
there
was
a
fragrance
of
spring
and
expensive
cigars
a
fragrance
of
happiness
and
everything
seemed
as
though
it
would
say
here
is
a
man
who
has
lived
and
laboured
and
has
attained
at
last
the
happiness
possible
on
earth
the
engineer
daughter
was
sitting
at
the
reading
a
newspaper
you
have
come
to
see
my
father
she
asked
he
is
having
a
shower
bath
he
will
be
here
directly
please
sit
down
and
wait
i
sat
down
i
believe
you
live
opposite
she
questioned
me
after
a
brief
silence
yes
i
am
so
bored
that
i
watch
you
every
day
out
of
the
window
you
must
excuse
me
she
went
on
looking
at
the
newspaper
and
i
often
see
your
sister
she
always
has
such
a
look
of
kindness
and
concentration
dolzhikov
came
in
he
was
rubbing
his
neck
with
a
towel
papa
monsieur
poloznev
said
his
daughter
yes
yes
blagovo
was
telling
me
he
turned
briskly
to
me
without
giving
me
his
hand
but
listen
what
can
i
give
you
what
sort
of
posts
have
i
got
you
are
a
queer
set
of
people
he
went
on
aloud
in
a
tone
as
though
he
were
giving
me
a
lecture
a
score
of
you
keep
coming
to
me
every
day
you
imagine
i
am
the
head
of
a
department
i
am
constructing
a
my
friends
i
have
employment
for
heavy
labour
i
need
mechanics
smiths
navvies
carpenters
and
none
of
you
can
do
anything
but
sit
and
write
you
are
all
clerks
and
he
seemed
to
me
to
have
the
same
air
of
happiness
as
his
rugs
and
easy
chairs
he
was
stout
and
healthy
and
in
a
print
cotton
shirt
and
full
trousers
like
a
toy
china
he
had
a
curly
round
beard
and
not
a
single
grey
hair
a
hooked
nose
and
clear
dark
guileless
eyes
what
can
you
do
he
went
on
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
i
am
an
engineer
i
am
a
man
of
an
assured
position
but
before
they
gave
me
a
i
was
for
years
in
harness
i
have
been
a
practical
mechanic
for
two
years
i
worked
in
belgium
as
an
oiler
you
can
judge
for
yourself
my
dear
fellow
what
kind
of
work
can
i
offer
you
of
course
that
is
so
i
muttered
in
extreme
confusion
unable
to
face
his
clear
guileless
eyes
can
you
work
the
telegraph
any
way
he
asked
after
a
thought
yes
i
have
been
a
telegraph
clerk
hm
well
we
will
see
then
meanwhile
go
to
dubetchnya
i
have
got
a
fellow
there
but
he
is
a
wretched
creature
and
what
will
my
duties
consist
of
i
asked
we
shall
see
go
there
meanwhile
i
will
make
arrangements
only
please
do
get
drunk
and
do
worry
me
with
requests
of
any
sort
or
i
shall
send
you
packing
he
turned
away
from
me
without
even
a
nod
i
bowed
to
him
and
his
daughter
who
was
reading
a
newspaper
and
went
away
my
heart
felt
so
heavy
that
when
my
sister
began
asking
me
how
the
engineer
had
received
me
i
could
not
utter
a
single
word
i
got
up
early
in
the
morning
at
sunrise
to
go
to
dubetchnya
there
was
not
a
soul
in
our
great
dvoryansky
street
everyone
was
asleep
and
my
footsteps
rang
out
with
a
solitary
hollow
sound
the
poplars
covered
with
dew
filled
the
air
with
soft
fragrance
i
was
sad
and
did
not
want
to
go
away
from
the
town
i
was
fond
of
my
native
town
it
seemed
to
be
so
beautiful
and
so
snug
i
loved
the
fresh
greenery
the
still
sunny
morning
the
chiming
of
our
bells
but
the
people
with
whom
i
lived
in
this
town
were
boring
alien
to
me
sometimes
even
repulsive
i
did
not
like
them
nor
understand
them
i
did
not
understand
what
these
thousand
people
lived
for
and
by
i
knew
that
kimry
lived
by
boots
that
tula
made
samovars
and
guns
that
odessa
was
a
but
what
our
town
was
and
what
it
did
i
did
not
know
great
dvoryansky
street
and
the
two
other
smartest
streets
lived
on
the
interest
of
capital
or
on
salaries
received
by
officials
from
the
public
treasury
but
what
the
other
eight
streets
which
ran
parallel
for
over
two
miles
and
vanished
beyond
the
hills
lived
upon
was
always
an
insoluble
riddle
to
me
and
the
way
those
people
lived
one
is
ashamed
to
describe
no
garden
no
theatre
no
decent
band
the
public
library
and
the
club
library
were
only
visited
by
jewish
youths
so
that
the
magazines
and
new
books
lay
for
months
uncut
rich
and
people
slept
in
close
stuffy
bedrooms
on
wooden
bedsteads
infested
with
bugs
their
children
were
kept
in
revoltingly
dirty
rooms
called
nurseries
and
the
servants
even
the
old
and
respected
ones
slept
on
the
floor
in
the
kitchen
covered
with
rags
on
ordinary
days
the
houses
smelt
of
beetroot
soup
and
on
fast
days
of
sturgeon
cooked
in
sunflower
oil
the
food
was
not
good
and
the
drinking
water
was
unwholesome
in
the
town
council
at
the
governor
at
the
head
priest
on
all
sides
in
private
houses
people
had
been
saying
for
years
and
years
that
our
town
had
not
a
good
and
cheap
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
a
loan
of
two
hundred
thousand
from
the
treasury
for
laying
on
water
very
rich
people
of
whom
three
dozen
could
have
been
counted
up
in
our
town
and
who
at
times
lost
whole
estates
at
cards
drank
the
polluted
water
too
and
talked
all
their
lives
with
great
excitement
of
a
loan
for
the
and
i
did
not
understand
that
it
seemed
to
me
it
would
have
been
simpler
to
take
the
two
hundred
thousand
out
of
their
own
pockets
and
lay
it
out
on
that
object
i
did
not
know
one
honest
man
in
the
town
my
father
took
bribes
and
imagined
that
they
were
given
him
out
of
respect
for
his
moral
qualities
at
the
high
school
in
order
to
be
moved
up
rapidly
from
class
to
class
the
boys
went
to
board
with
their
teachers
who
charged
them
exorbitant
sums
the
wife
of
the
military
commander
took
bribes
from
the
recruits
when
they
were
called
up
before
the
board
and
even
deigned
to
accept
refreshments
from
them
and
on
one
occasion
could
not
get
up
from
her
knees
in
church
because
she
was
drunk
the
doctors
took
bribes
too
when
the
recruits
came
up
for
examination
and
the
town
doctor
and
the
veterinary
surgeon
levied
a
regular
tax
on
the
butchers
shops
and
the
restaurants
at
the
district
school
they
did
a
trade
in
certificates
qualifying
for
partial
exemption
from
military
service
the
higher
clergy
took
bribes
from
the
humbler
priests
and
from
the
church
elders
at
the
municipal
the
artisans
and
all
the
other
boards
every
petitioner
was
pursued
by
a
shout
do
forget
your
thanks
and
the
petitioner
would
turn
back
to
give
sixpence
or
a
shilling
and
those
who
did
not
take
bribes
such
as
the
higher
officials
of
the
department
of
justice
were
haughty
offered
two
fingers
instead
of
shaking
hands
were
distinguished
by
the
frigidity
and
narrowness
of
their
judgments
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
over
cards
drank
to
excess
married
heiresses
and
undoubtedly
had
a
pernicious
corrupting
influence
on
those
around
them
it
was
only
the
girls
who
had
still
the
fresh
fragrance
of
moral
purity
most
of
them
had
higher
impulses
pure
and
honest
hearts
but
they
had
no
understanding
of
life
and
believed
that
bribes
were
given
out
of
respect
for
moral
qualities
and
after
they
were
married
grew
old
quickly
let
themselves
go
completely
and
sank
hopelessly
in
the
mire
of
vulgar
petty
bourgeois
existence
iii
a
was
being
constructed
in
our
neighbourhood
on
the
eve
of
feast
days
the
streets
were
thronged
with
ragged
fellows
whom
the
townspeople
called
navvies
and
of
whom
they
were
afraid
and
more
than
once
i
had
seen
one
of
these
tatterdemalions
with
a
bloodstained
countenance
being
led
to
the
police
station
while
a
samovar
or
some
linen
wet
from
the
wash
was
carried
behind
by
way
of
material
evidence
the
navvies
usually
congregated
about
the
taverns
and
the
they
drank
ate
and
used
bad
language
and
pursued
with
shrill
whistles
every
woman
of
light
behaviour
who
passed
by
to
entertain
this
hungry
rabble
our
shopkeepers
made
cats
and
dogs
drunk
with
vodka
or
tied
an
old
kerosene
can
to
a
dog
tail
a
hue
and
cry
was
raised
and
the
dog
dashed
along
the
street
jingling
the
can
squealing
with
terror
it
fancied
some
monster
was
close
upon
its
heels
it
would
run
far
out
of
the
town
into
the
open
country
and
there
sink
exhausted
there
were
in
the
town
several
dogs
who
went
about
trembling
with
their
tails
between
their
legs
and
people
said
this
diversion
had
been
too
much
for
them
and
had
driven
them
mad
a
station
was
being
built
four
miles
from
the
town
it
was
said
that
the
engineers
asked
for
a
bribe
of
fifty
thousand
roubles
for
bringing
the
line
right
up
to
the
town
but
the
town
council
would
only
consent
to
give
forty
thousand
they
could
not
come
to
an
agreement
over
the
difference
and
now
the
townspeople
regretted
it
as
they
had
to
make
a
road
to
the
station
and
that
it
was
reckoned
would
cost
more
the
sleepers
and
rails
had
been
laid
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
line
and
trains
ran
up
and
down
it
bringing
building
materials
and
labourers
and
further
progress
was
only
delayed
on
account
of
the
bridges
which
dolzhikov
was
building
and
some
of
the
stations
were
not
yet
finished
dubetchnya
as
our
first
station
was
called
was
a
little
under
twelve
miles
from
the
town
i
walked
the
cornfields
bathed
in
the
morning
sunshine
were
bright
green
it
was
a
flat
cheerful
country
and
in
the
distance
there
were
the
distinct
outlines
of
the
station
of
ancient
barrows
and
homesteads
how
nice
it
was
out
there
in
the
open
and
how
i
longed
to
be
filled
with
the
sense
of
freedom
if
only
for
that
one
morning
that
i
might
not
think
of
what
was
being
done
in
the
town
not
think
of
my
needs
not
feel
hungry
nothing
has
so
marred
my
existence
as
an
acute
feeling
of
hunger
which
made
images
of
buckwheat
porridge
rissoles
and
baked
fish
mingle
strangely
with
my
best
thoughts
here
i
was
standing
alone
in
the
open
country
gazing
upward
at
a
lark
which
hovered
in
the
air
at
the
same
spot
trilling
as
though
in
hysterics
and
meanwhile
i
was
thinking
how
nice
it
would
be
to
eat
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
or
i
would
sit
down
by
the
roadside
to
rest
and
shut
my
eyes
to
listen
to
the
delicious
sounds
of
may
and
what
haunted
me
was
the
smell
of
hot
potatoes
though
i
was
tall
and
strongly
built
i
had
as
a
rule
little
to
eat
and
so
the
predominant
sensation
throughout
the
day
was
hunger
and
perhaps
that
was
why
i
knew
so
well
how
it
is
that
such
multitudes
of
people
toil
merely
for
their
daily
bread
and
can
talk
of
nothing
but
things
to
eat
at
dubetchnya
they
were
plastering
the
inside
of
the
station
and
building
a
wooden
upper
storey
to
the
pumping
shed
it
was
hot
there
was
a
smell
of
lime
and
the
workmen
sauntered
listlessly
between
the
heaps
of
shavings
and
mortar
rubble
the
pointsman
lay
asleep
near
his
sentry
box
and
the
sun
was
blazing
full
on
his
face
there
was
not
a
single
tree
the
telegraph
wire
hummed
faintly
and
hawks
were
perching
on
it
here
and
there
i
wandering
too
among
the
heaps
of
rubbish
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
recalled
how
the
engineer
in
answer
to
my
question
what
my
duties
would
consist
in
had
said
we
shall
see
when
you
are
there
but
what
could
one
see
in
that
wilderness
the
plasterers
spoke
of
the
foreman
and
of
a
certain
fyodot
vasilyev
i
did
not
understand
and
gradually
i
was
overcome
by
depression
the
physical
depression
in
which
one
is
conscious
of
one
arms
and
legs
and
huge
body
and
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
or
where
to
put
them
after
i
had
been
walking
about
for
at
least
a
couple
of
hours
i
noticed
that
there
were
telegraph
poles
running
off
to
the
right
from
the
station
and
that
they
ended
a
mile
or
a
mile
and
a
half
away
at
a
white
stone
wall
the
workmen
told
me
the
office
was
there
and
at
last
i
reflected
that
that
was
where
i
ought
to
go
it
was
a
very
old
manor
house
deserted
long
ago
the
wall
round
it
of
porous
white
stone
was
mouldering
and
had
fallen
away
in
places
and
the
lodge
the
blank
wall
of
which
looked
out
on
the
open
country
had
a
rusty
roof
with
patches
of
gleaming
here
and
there
on
it
within
the
gates
could
be
seen
a
spacious
courtyard
overgrown
with
rough
weeds
and
an
old
manor
house
with
sunblinds
on
the
windows
and
a
high
roof
red
with
rust
two
lodges
exactly
alike
stood
one
on
each
side
of
the
house
to
right
and
to
left
one
had
its
windows
nailed
up
with
boards
near
the
other
of
which
the
windows
were
open
there
was
washing
on
the
line
and
there
were
calves
moving
about
the
last
of
the
telegraph
poles
stood
in
the
courtyard
and
the
wire
from
it
ran
to
the
window
of
the
lodge
of
which
the
blank
wall
looked
out
into
the
open
country
the
door
stood
open
i
went
in
by
the
telegraph
apparatus
a
gentleman
with
a
curly
dark
head
wearing
a
reefer
coat
made
of
sailcloth
was
sitting
at
a
table
he
glanced
at
me
morosely
from
under
his
brows
but
immediately
smiled
and
said
hullo
it
was
ivan
tcheprakov
an
old
schoolfellow
of
mine
who
had
been
expelled
from
the
second
class
for
smoking
we
used
at
one
time
during
autumn
to
catch
goldfinches
finches
and
linnets
together
and
to
sell
them
in
the
market
early
in
the
morning
while
our
parents
were
still
in
their
beds
we
watched
for
flocks
of
migrating
starlings
and
shot
at
them
with
small
shot
then
we
picked
up
those
that
were
wounded
and
some
of
them
died
in
our
hands
in
terrible
agonies
i
remember
to
this
day
how
they
moaned
in
the
cage
at
night
those
that
recovered
we
sold
and
swore
with
the
utmost
effrontery
that
they
were
all
cocks
on
one
occasion
at
the
market
i
had
only
one
starling
left
which
i
had
offered
to
purchasers
in
vain
till
at
last
i
sold
it
for
a
farthing
anyway
it
better
than
nothing
i
said
to
comfort
myself
as
i
put
the
farthing
in
my
pocket
and
from
that
day
the
street
urchins
and
the
schoolboys
called
after
me
and
to
this
day
the
street
boys
and
the
shopkeepers
mock
at
me
with
the
nickname
though
no
one
remembers
how
it
arose
tcheprakov
was
not
of
robust
constitution
he
was
and
he
wore
a
silk
cord
for
a
tie
had
no
trace
of
a
waistcoat
and
his
boots
were
worse
than
mine
with
the
heels
trodden
down
on
one
side
he
stared
hardly
even
blinking
with
a
strained
expression
as
though
he
were
just
going
to
catch
something
and
he
was
always
in
a
fuss
you
wait
a
minute
he
would
say
fussily
you
listen
whatever
was
i
talking
about
we
got
into
conversation
i
learned
that
the
estate
on
which
i
now
was
had
until
recently
been
the
property
of
the
tcheprakovs
and
had
only
the
autumn
before
passed
into
the
possession
of
dolzhikov
who
considered
it
more
profitable
to
put
his
money
into
land
than
to
keep
it
in
notes
and
had
already
bought
up
three
mortgaged
estates
in
our
neighbourhood
at
the
sale
mother
had
reserved
for
herself
the
right
to
live
for
the
next
two
years
in
one
of
the
lodges
at
the
side
and
had
obtained
a
post
for
her
son
in
the
office
i
should
think
he
could
buy
tcheprakov
said
of
the
engineer
see
what
he
fleeces
out
of
the
contractors
alone
he
fleeces
everyone
then
he
took
me
to
dinner
deciding
fussily
that
i
should
live
with
him
in
the
lodge
and
have
my
meals
from
his
mother
she
is
a
bit
stingy
he
said
but
she
wo
charge
you
much
it
was
very
cramped
in
the
little
rooms
in
which
his
mother
lived
they
were
all
even
the
passage
and
the
entry
piled
up
with
furniture
which
had
been
brought
from
the
big
house
after
the
sale
and
the
furniture
was
all
mahogany
madame
tcheprakov
a
very
stout
lady
with
slanting
chinese
eyes
was
sitting
in
a
big
by
the
window
knitting
a
stocking
she
received
me
ceremoniously
this
is
poloznev
mamma
tcheprakov
introduced
me
he
is
going
to
serve
here
are
you
a
nobleman
she
asked
in
a
strange
disagreeable
voice
it
seemed
to
me
to
sound
as
though
fat
were
bubbling
in
her
throat
yes
i
answered
sit
down
the
dinner
was
a
poor
one
nothing
was
served
but
pies
filled
with
bitter
curd
and
milk
soup
elena
nikiforovna
who
presided
kept
blinking
in
a
queer
way
first
with
one
eye
and
then
with
the
other
she
talked
she
ate
but
yet
there
was
something
deathly
about
her
whole
figure
and
one
almost
fancied
the
faint
smell
of
a
corpse
there
was
only
a
glimmer
of
life
in
her
a
glimmer
of
consciousness
that
she
had
been
a
lady
who
had
once
had
her
own
serfs
that
she
was
the
widow
of
a
general
whom
the
servants
had
to
address
as
your
excellency
and
when
these
feeble
relics
of
life
flickered
up
in
her
for
an
instant
she
would
say
to
her
son
jean
you
are
not
holding
your
knife
properly
or
she
would
say
to
me
drawing
a
deep
breath
with
the
mincing
air
of
a
hostess
trying
to
entertain
a
visitor
you
know
we
have
sold
our
estate
of
course
it
is
a
pity
we
are
used
to
the
place
but
dolzhikov
has
promised
to
make
jean
stationmaster
of
dubetchnya
so
we
shall
not
have
to
go
away
we
shall
live
here
at
the
station
and
that
is
just
the
same
as
being
on
our
own
property
the
engineer
is
so
nice
do
you
think
he
is
very
handsome
until
recently
the
tcheprakovs
had
lived
in
a
wealthy
style
but
since
the
death
of
the
general
everything
had
been
changed
elena
nikiforovna
had
taken
to
quarrelling
with
the
neighbours
to
going
to
law
and
to
not
paying
her
bailiffs
or
her
labourers
she
was
in
constant
terror
of
being
robbed
and
in
some
ten
years
dubetchnya
had
become
unrecognizable
behind
the
great
house
was
an
old
garden
which
had
already
run
wild
and
was
overgrown
with
rough
weeds
and
bushes
i
walked
up
and
down
the
verandah
which
was
still
solid
and
beautiful
through
the
glass
doors
one
could
see
a
room
with
parquetted
floor
probably
the
an
piano
and
pictures
in
deep
mahogany
frames
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
old
all
that
remained
were
peonies
and
poppies
which
lifted
their
white
and
bright
red
heads
above
the
grass
young
maples
and
elms
already
nibbled
by
the
cows
grew
beside
the
paths
drawn
up
and
hindering
each
other
growth
the
garden
was
thickly
overgrown
and
seemed
impassable
but
this
was
only
near
the
house
where
there
stood
poplars
and
old
limetrees
all
of
the
same
age
relics
of
the
former
avenues
further
on
beyond
them
the
garden
had
been
cleared
for
the
sake
of
hay
and
here
it
was
not
moist
and
stuffy
and
there
were
no
spiders
webs
in
one
mouth
and
eyes
a
light
breeze
was
blowing
the
further
one
went
the
more
open
it
was
and
here
in
the
open
space
were
cherries
plums
and
spreading
disfigured
by
props
and
by
canker
and
so
tall
that
one
could
not
believe
they
were
this
part
of
the
garden
was
let
to
some
shopkeepers
of
the
town
and
it
was
protected
from
thieves
and
starlings
by
a
peasant
who
lived
in
a
shanty
in
it
the
garden
growing
more
and
more
open
till
it
became
definitely
a
meadow
sloped
down
to
the
river
which
was
overgrown
with
green
weeds
and
osiers
near
the
milldam
was
the
millpond
deep
and
full
of
fish
a
little
mill
with
a
thatched
roof
was
working
away
with
a
wrathful
sound
and
frogs
croaked
furiously
circles
passed
from
time
to
time
over
the
smooth
water
and
the
trembled
stirred
by
the
lively
fish
on
the
further
side
of
the
river
was
the
little
village
dubetchnya
the
still
blue
millpond
was
alluring
with
its
promise
of
coolness
and
peace
and
now
all
this
the
millpond
and
the
mill
and
the
banks
belonged
to
the
engineer
and
so
my
new
work
began
i
received
and
forwarded
telegrams
wrote
various
reports
and
made
fair
copies
of
the
notes
of
requirements
the
complaints
and
the
reports
sent
to
the
office
by
the
illiterate
foremen
and
workmen
but
for
the
greater
part
of
the
day
i
did
nothing
but
walk
about
the
room
waiting
for
telegrams
or
made
a
boy
sit
in
the
lodge
while
i
went
for
a
walk
in
the
garden
until
the
boy
ran
to
tell
me
that
there
was
a
tapping
at
the
operating
machine
i
had
dinner
at
madame
tcheprakov
meat
we
had
very
rarely
our
dishes
were
all
made
of
milk
and
wednesdays
and
fridays
were
fast
days
and
on
those
days
we
had
pink
plates
which
were
called
lenten
plates
madame
tcheprakov
was
continually
blinking
it
was
her
invariable
habit
and
i
always
felt
ill
at
ease
in
her
presence
as
there
was
not
enough
work
in
the
lodge
for
one
tcheprakov
did
nothing
but
simply
dozed
or
went
with
his
gun
to
shoot
ducks
on
the
millpond
in
the
evenings
he
drank
too
much
in
the
village
or
the
station
and
before
going
to
bed
stared
in
the
and
said
hullo
ivan
tcheprakov
when
he
was
drunk
he
was
very
pale
and
kept
rubbing
his
hands
and
laughing
with
a
sound
like
a
neigh
by
way
of
bravado
he
used
to
strip
and
run
about
the
country
naked
he
used
to
eat
flies
and
say
they
were
rather
sour
iv
one
day
after
dinner
he
ran
breathless
into
the
lodge
and
said
go
along
your
sister
has
come
i
went
out
and
there
i
found
a
hired
brake
from
the
town
standing
before
the
entrance
of
the
great
house
my
sister
had
come
in
it
with
anyuta
blagovo
and
a
gentleman
in
a
military
tunic
going
up
closer
i
recognized
the
latter
it
was
the
brother
of
anyuta
blagovo
the
army
doctor
we
have
come
to
you
for
a
picnic
he
said
is
that
all
right
my
sister
and
anyuta
wanted
to
ask
how
i
was
getting
on
here
but
both
were
silent
and
simply
gazed
at
me
i
was
silent
too
they
saw
that
i
did
not
like
the
place
and
tears
came
into
my
eyes
while
anyuta
blagovo
turned
crimson
we
went
into
the
garden
the
doctor
walked
ahead
of
us
all
and
said
enthusiastically
what
air
holy
mother
what
air
in
appearance
he
was
still
a
student
and
he
walked
and
talked
like
a
student
and
the
expression
of
his
grey
eyes
was
as
keen
honest
and
frank
as
a
nice
student
beside
his
tall
and
handsome
sister
he
looked
frail
and
thin
and
his
beard
was
thin
too
and
his
voice
too
was
a
thin
but
rather
agreeable
tenor
he
was
serving
in
a
regiment
somewhere
and
had
come
home
to
his
people
for
a
holiday
and
said
he
was
going
in
the
autumn
to
petersburg
for
his
examination
as
a
doctor
of
medicine
he
was
already
a
family
man
with
a
wife
and
three
children
he
had
married
very
young
in
his
second
year
at
the
university
and
now
people
in
the
town
said
he
was
unhappy
in
his
family
life
and
was
not
living
with
his
wife
what
time
is
it
my
sister
asked
uneasily
we
must
get
back
in
good
time
papa
let
me
come
to
see
my
brother
on
condition
i
was
back
at
six
oh
bother
your
papa
sighed
the
doctor
i
set
the
samovar
we
put
down
a
carpet
before
the
verandah
of
the
great
house
and
had
our
tea
there
and
the
doctor
knelt
down
drank
out
of
his
saucer
and
declared
that
he
now
knew
what
bliss
was
then
tcheprakov
came
with
the
key
and
opened
the
glass
door
and
we
all
went
into
the
house
there
it
was
half
dark
and
mysterious
and
smelt
of
mushrooms
and
our
footsteps
had
a
hollow
sound
as
though
there
were
cellars
under
the
floor
the
doctor
stopped
and
touched
the
keys
of
the
piano
and
it
responded
faintly
with
a
husky
quivering
but
melodious
chord
he
tried
his
voice
and
sang
a
song
frowning
and
tapping
impatiently
with
his
foot
when
some
note
was
mute
my
sister
did
not
talk
about
going
home
but
walked
about
the
rooms
and
kept
saying
how
happy
i
am
how
happy
i
am
there
was
a
note
of
astonishment
in
her
voice
as
though
it
seemed
to
her
incredible
that
she
too
could
feel
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
had
seen
her
so
happy
she
actually
looked
prettier
in
profile
she
did
not
look
nice
her
nose
and
mouth
seemed
to
stick
out
and
had
an
expression
as
though
she
were
pouting
but
she
had
beautiful
dark
eyes
a
pale
very
delicate
complexion
and
a
touching
expression
of
goodness
and
melancholy
and
when
she
talked
she
seemed
charming
and
even
beautiful
we
both
she
and
i
took
after
our
mother
were
broad
shouldered
strongly
built
and
capable
of
endurance
but
her
pallor
was
a
sign
of
she
often
had
a
cough
and
i
sometimes
caught
in
her
face
that
look
one
sees
in
people
who
are
seriously
ill
but
for
some
reason
conceal
the
fact
there
was
something
naïve
and
childish
in
her
gaiety
now
as
though
the
joy
that
had
been
suppressed
and
smothered
in
our
childhood
by
harsh
education
had
now
suddenly
awakened
in
her
soul
and
found
a
free
outlet
but
when
evening
came
on
and
the
horses
were
brought
round
my
sister
sank
into
silence
and
looked
thin
and
shrunken
and
she
got
into
the
brake
as
though
she
were
going
to
the
scaffold
when
they
had
all
gone
and
the
sound
had
died
away
i
remembered
that
anyuta
blagovo
had
not
said
a
word
to
me
all
day
she
is
a
wonderful
girl
i
thought
wonderful
girl
peter
fast
came
and
we
had
nothing
but
lenten
dishes
every
day
i
was
weighed
down
by
physical
depression
due
to
idleness
and
my
unsettled
position
and
dissatisfied
with
myself
listless
and
hungry
i
lounged
about
the
garden
and
only
waited
for
a
suitable
mood
to
go
away
towards
evening
one
day
when
radish
was
sitting
in
the
lodge
dolzhikov
very
sunburnt
and
grey
with
dust
walked
in
unexpectedly
he
had
been
spending
three
days
on
his
land
and
had
come
now
to
dubetchnya
by
the
steamer
and
walked
to
us
from
the
station
while
waiting
for
the
carriage
which
was
to
come
for
him
from
the
town
he
walked
round
the
grounds
with
his
bailiff
giving
orders
in
a
loud
voice
then
sat
for
a
whole
hour
in
our
lodge
writing
letters
while
he
was
there
telegrams
came
for
him
and
he
himself
tapped
off
the
answers
we
three
stood
in
silence
at
attention
what
a
muddle
he
said
glancing
contemptuously
at
a
record
book
in
a
fortnight
i
am
transferring
the
office
to
the
station
and
i
do
know
what
i
am
to
do
with
you
my
friends
i
do
my
best
your
honour
said
tcheprakov
to
be
sure
i
see
how
you
do
your
best
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
to
take
your
salary
the
engineer
went
on
looking
at
me
you
keep
relying
on
patronage
to
le
as
quickly
and
as
easily
as
possible
well
i
do
care
for
patronage
no
one
took
any
trouble
on
my
behalf
before
they
gave
me
a
railway
contract
i
went
about
as
a
mechanic
and
worked
in
belgium
as
an
oiler
and
you
panteley
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
turning
to
radish
drinking
with
them
he
for
some
reason
always
called
humble
people
panteley
and
such
as
me
and
tcheprakov
he
despised
and
called
them
drunkards
beasts
and
rabble
to
their
faces
altogether
he
was
cruel
to
humble
subordinates
and
used
to
fine
them
and
turn
them
off
coldly
without
explanations
at
last
the
horses
came
for
him
as
he
said
he
promised
to
turn
us
all
off
in
a
fortnight
he
called
his
bailiff
a
blockhead
and
then
lolling
at
ease
in
his
carriage
drove
back
to
the
town
andrey
ivanitch
i
said
to
radish
take
me
on
as
a
workman
oh
all
right
and
we
set
off
together
in
the
direction
of
the
town
when
the
station
and
the
big
house
with
its
buildings
were
left
behind
i
asked
andrey
ivanitch
why
did
you
come
to
dubetchnya
this
evening
in
the
first
place
my
fellows
are
working
on
the
line
and
in
the
second
place
i
came
to
pay
the
general
lady
my
interest
last
year
i
borrowed
fifty
roubles
from
her
and
i
pay
her
now
a
rouble
a
month
interest
the
painter
stopped
and
took
me
by
the
button
misail
alexeyitch
our
angel
he
went
on
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
that
if
any
man
gentle
or
simple
takes
even
the
smallest
interest
he
is
doing
evil
there
can
not
be
truth
and
justice
in
such
a
man
radish
lean
pale
shut
his
eyes
shook
his
head
and
in
the
tone
of
a
philosopher
pronounced
lice
consume
the
grass
rust
consumes
the
iron
and
lying
the
soul
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
sinners
v
radish
was
not
practical
and
was
not
at
all
good
at
forming
an
estimate
he
took
more
work
than
he
could
get
through
and
when
calculating
he
was
agitated
lost
his
head
and
so
was
almost
always
out
of
pocket
over
his
jobs
he
undertook
painting
glazing
paperhanging
and
even
tiling
roofs
and
i
can
remember
his
running
about
for
three
days
to
find
tilers
for
the
sake
of
a
paltry
job
he
was
a
workman
he
sometimes
earned
as
much
as
ten
roubles
a
day
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
desire
at
all
costs
to
be
a
master
and
to
be
called
a
contractor
he
would
probably
have
had
plenty
of
money
he
was
paid
by
the
job
but
he
paid
me
and
the
other
workmen
by
the
day
from
one
and
twopence
to
two
shillings
a
day
when
it
was
fine
and
dry
we
did
all
kinds
of
outside
work
chiefly
painting
roofs
when
i
was
new
to
the
work
it
made
my
feet
burn
as
though
i
were
walking
on
hot
bricks
and
when
i
put
on
felt
boots
they
were
hotter
than
ever
but
this
was
only
at
first
later
on
i
got
used
to
it
and
everything
went
swimmingly
i
was
living
now
among
people
to
whom
labour
was
obligatory
inevitable
and
who
worked
like
often
with
no
idea
of
the
moral
significance
of
labour
and
indeed
never
using
the
word
labour
in
conversation
at
all
beside
them
i
too
felt
like
a
growing
more
and
more
imbued
with
the
feeling
of
the
obligatory
and
inevitable
character
of
what
i
was
doing
and
this
made
my
life
easier
setting
me
free
from
all
doubt
and
uncertainty
at
first
everything
interested
me
everything
was
new
as
though
i
had
been
born
again
i
could
sleep
on
the
ground
and
go
about
barefoot
and
that
was
extremely
pleasant
i
could
stand
in
a
crowd
of
the
common
people
and
be
no
constraint
to
anyone
and
when
a
cab
horse
fell
down
in
the
street
i
ran
to
help
it
up
without
being
afraid
of
soiling
my
clothes
and
the
best
of
it
all
was
i
was
living
on
my
own
account
and
no
burden
to
anyone
painting
roofs
especially
with
our
own
oil
and
colours
was
regarded
as
a
particularly
profitable
job
and
so
this
rough
dull
work
was
not
disdained
even
by
such
good
workmen
as
radish
in
short
breeches
and
wasted
legs
he
used
to
go
about
the
roofs
looking
like
a
stork
and
i
used
to
hear
him
as
he
plied
his
brush
breathing
heavily
and
saying
woe
woe
to
us
sinners
he
walked
about
the
roofs
as
freely
as
though
he
were
upon
the
ground
in
spite
of
his
being
ill
and
pale
as
a
corpse
his
agility
was
extraordinary
he
used
to
paint
the
domes
and
cupolas
of
the
churches
without
scaffolding
like
a
young
man
with
only
the
help
of
a
ladder
and
a
rope
and
it
was
rather
horrible
when
standing
on
a
height
far
from
the
earth
he
would
draw
himself
up
erect
and
for
some
unknown
reason
pronounce
lice
consume
grass
rust
consumes
iron
and
lying
the
soul
or
thinking
about
something
would
answer
his
thoughts
aloud
anything
may
happen
anything
may
happen
when
i
went
home
from
my
work
all
the
people
who
were
sitting
on
benches
by
the
gates
all
the
shopmen
and
boys
and
their
employers
made
sneering
and
spiteful
remarks
after
me
and
this
upset
me
at
first
and
seemed
to
be
simply
monstrous
i
heard
on
all
sides
house
painter
yellow
ochre
and
none
behaved
so
ungraciously
to
me
as
those
who
had
only
lately
been
humble
people
themselves
and
had
earned
their
bread
by
hard
manual
labour
in
the
streets
full
of
shops
i
was
once
passing
an
ironmonger
when
water
was
thrown
over
me
as
though
by
accident
and
on
one
occasion
someone
darted
out
with
a
stick
at
me
while
a
fishmonger
a
old
man
barred
my
way
and
said
looking
at
me
angrily
i
am
not
sorry
for
you
you
fool
it
your
father
i
am
sorry
for
and
my
acquaintances
were
for
some
reason
overcome
with
embarrassment
when
they
met
me
some
of
them
looked
upon
me
as
a
queer
fish
and
a
comic
fool
others
were
sorry
for
me
others
did
not
know
what
attitude
to
take
up
to
me
and
it
was
difficult
to
make
them
out
one
day
i
met
anyuta
blagovo
in
a
side
street
near
great
dvoryansky
street
i
was
going
to
work
and
was
carrying
two
long
brushes
and
a
pail
of
paint
recognizing
me
anyuta
flushed
crimson
please
do
not
bow
to
me
in
the
street
she
said
nervously
harshly
and
in
a
shaking
voice
without
offering
me
her
hand
and
tears
suddenly
gleamed
in
her
eyes
if
to
your
mind
all
this
is
necessary
so
be
it
so
be
it
but
i
beg
you
not
to
meet
me
i
no
longer
lived
in
great
dvoryansky
street
but
in
the
suburb
with
my
old
nurse
karpovna
a
but
gloomy
old
woman
who
always
foreboded
some
harm
was
afraid
of
all
dreams
and
even
in
the
bees
and
wasps
that
flew
into
her
room
saw
omens
of
evil
and
the
fact
that
i
had
become
a
workman
to
her
thinking
boded
nothing
good
your
life
is
ruined
she
would
say
mournfully
shaking
her
head
ruined
her
adopted
son
prokofy
a
huge
uncouth
fellow
of
thirty
with
bristling
moustaches
a
butcher
by
trade
lived
in
the
little
house
with
her
when
he
met
me
in
the
passage
he
would
make
way
for
me
in
respectful
silence
and
if
he
was
drunk
he
would
salute
me
with
all
five
fingers
at
once
he
used
to
have
supper
in
the
evening
and
through
the
partition
wall
of
boards
i
could
hear
him
clear
his
throat
and
sigh
as
he
drank
off
glass
after
glass
mamma
he
would
call
in
an
undertone
well
karpovna
who
was
passionately
devoted
to
her
adopted
son
would
respond
what
is
it
sonny
i
can
show
you
a
testimony
of
my
affection
mamma
all
this
earthly
life
i
will
cherish
you
in
your
declining
years
in
this
vale
of
tears
and
when
you
die
i
will
bury
you
at
my
expense
i
have
said
it
and
you
can
believe
it
i
got
up
every
morning
before
sunrise
and
went
to
bed
early
we
house
painters
ate
a
great
deal
and
slept
soundly
the
only
thing
amiss
was
that
my
heart
used
to
beat
violently
at
night
i
did
not
quarrel
with
my
mates
violent
abuse
desperate
oaths
and
wishes
such
as
blast
your
eyes
or
cholera
take
you
never
ceased
all
day
but
nevertheless
we
lived
on
very
friendly
terms
the
other
fellows
suspected
me
of
being
some
sort
of
religious
sectary
and
made
jokes
at
my
expense
saying
that
even
my
own
father
had
disowned
me
and
thereupon
would
add
that
they
rarely
went
into
the
temple
of
god
themselves
and
that
many
of
them
had
not
been
to
confession
for
ten
years
they
justified
this
laxity
on
their
part
by
saying
that
a
painter
among
men
was
like
a
jackdaw
among
birds
the
men
had
a
good
opinion
of
me
and
treated
me
with
respect
it
was
evident
that
my
not
drinking
not
smoking
but
leading
a
quiet
steady
life
pleased
them
very
much
it
was
only
an
unpleasant
shock
to
them
that
i
took
no
hand
in
stealing
oil
and
did
not
go
with
them
to
ask
for
tips
from
people
on
whose
property
we
were
working
stealing
oil
and
paints
from
those
who
employed
them
was
a
house
painter
custom
and
was
not
regarded
as
theft
and
it
was
remarkable
that
even
so
upright
a
man
as
radish
would
always
carry
away
a
little
white
lead
and
oil
as
he
went
home
from
work
and
even
the
most
respectable
old
fellows
who
owned
the
houses
in
which
they
lived
in
the
suburb
were
not
ashamed
to
ask
for
a
tip
and
it
made
me
feel
vexed
and
ashamed
to
see
the
men
go
in
a
body
to
congratulate
some
nonentity
on
the
commencement
or
the
completion
of
the
job
and
thank
him
with
degrading
servility
when
they
had
received
a
few
coppers
with
people
on
whose
work
they
were
engaged
they
behaved
like
wily
courtiers
and
almost
every
day
i
was
reminded
of
polonius
i
fancy
it
is
going
to
rain
the
man
whose
house
was
being
painted
would
say
looking
at
the
sky
it
is
there
is
not
a
doubt
it
is
the
painters
would
agree
i
do
think
it
is
a
though
perhaps
it
wo
rain
after
all
no
it
wo
your
honour
i
am
sure
it
wo
but
their
attitude
to
their
patrons
behind
their
backs
was
usually
one
of
irony
and
when
they
saw
for
instance
a
gentleman
sitting
in
the
verandah
reading
a
newspaper
they
would
observe
he
reads
the
paper
but
i
daresay
he
has
nothing
to
eat
i
never
went
home
to
see
my
own
people
when
i
came
back
from
work
i
often
found
waiting
for
me
little
notes
brief
and
anxious
in
which
my
sister
wrote
to
me
about
my
father
that
he
had
been
particularly
preoccupied
at
dinner
and
had
eaten
nothing
or
that
he
had
been
giddy
and
staggering
or
that
he
had
locked
himself
in
his
room
and
had
not
come
out
for
a
long
time
such
items
of
news
troubled
me
i
could
not
sleep
and
at
times
even
walked
up
and
down
great
dvoryansky
street
at
night
by
our
house
looking
in
at
the
dark
windows
and
trying
to
guess
whether
everything
was
well
at
home
on
sundays
my
sister
came
to
see
me
but
came
in
secret
as
though
it
were
not
to
see
me
but
our
nurse
and
if
she
came
in
to
see
me
she
was
very
pale
with
eyes
and
she
began
crying
at
once
our
father
will
never
live
through
this
she
would
say
if
anything
should
happen
to
him
god
grant
it
may
not
your
conscience
will
torment
you
all
your
life
it
awful
misail
for
our
mother
sake
i
beseech
you
reform
your
ways
my
darling
sister
i
would
say
how
can
i
reform
my
ways
if
i
am
convinced
that
i
am
acting
in
accordance
with
my
conscience
do
understand
i
know
you
are
acting
on
your
conscience
but
perhaps
it
could
be
done
differently
somehow
so
as
not
to
wound
anybody
ah
holy
saints
the
old
woman
sighed
through
the
door
your
life
is
ruined
there
will
be
trouble
my
dears
there
will
be
trouble
vi
one
sunday
blagovo
turned
up
unexpectedly
he
was
wearing
a
military
tunic
over
a
silk
shirt
and
high
boots
of
patent
leather
i
have
come
to
see
you
he
began
shaking
my
hand
heartily
like
a
student
i
am
hearing
about
you
every
day
and
i
have
been
meaning
to
come
and
have
a
talk
as
they
say
the
boredom
in
the
town
is
awful
there
is
not
a
living
soul
no
one
to
say
a
word
to
it
hot
holy
mother
he
went
on
taking
off
his
tunic
and
sitting
in
his
silk
shirt
my
dear
fellow
let
me
talk
to
you
i
was
dull
myself
and
had
for
a
long
time
been
craving
for
the
society
of
someone
not
a
house
painter
i
was
genuinely
glad
to
see
him
i
begin
by
saying
he
said
sitting
down
on
my
bed
that
i
sympathize
with
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
and
deeply
respect
the
life
you
are
leading
they
do
understand
you
here
in
the
town
and
indeed
there
is
no
one
to
understand
seeing
that
as
you
know
they
are
all
with
very
few
exceptions
regular
gogolesque
pig
faces
here
but
i
saw
what
you
were
at
once
that
time
at
the
picnic
you
are
a
noble
soul
an
honest
man
i
respect
you
and
feel
it
a
great
honour
to
shake
hands
with
you
he
went
on
enthusiastically
to
have
made
such
a
complete
and
violent
change
of
life
as
you
have
done
you
must
have
passed
through
a
complicated
spiritual
crisis
and
to
continue
this
manner
of
life
now
and
to
keep
up
to
the
high
standard
of
your
convictions
continually
must
be
a
strain
on
your
mind
and
heart
from
day
to
day
now
to
begin
our
talk
tell
me
do
you
consider
that
if
you
had
spent
your
strength
of
will
this
strained
activity
all
these
powers
on
something
else
for
instance
on
gradually
becoming
a
great
scientist
or
artist
your
life
would
have
been
broader
and
deeper
and
would
have
been
more
productive
we
talked
and
when
we
got
upon
manual
labour
i
expressed
this
idea
that
what
is
wanted
is
that
the
strong
should
not
enslave
the
weak
that
the
minority
should
not
be
a
parasite
on
the
majority
nor
a
vampire
for
ever
sucking
its
vital
sap
that
is
all
without
exception
strong
and
weak
rich
and
poor
should
take
part
equally
in
the
struggle
for
existence
each
one
on
his
own
account
and
that
there
was
no
better
means
for
equalizing
things
in
that
way
than
manual
labour
in
the
form
of
universal
service
compulsory
for
all
then
do
you
think
everyone
without
exception
ought
to
engage
in
manual
labour
asked
the
doctor
yes
and
do
you
think
that
if
everyone
including
the
best
men
the
thinkers
and
great
scientists
taking
part
in
the
struggle
for
existence
each
on
his
own
account
are
going
to
waste
their
time
breaking
stones
and
painting
roofs
may
not
that
threaten
a
grave
danger
to
progress
where
is
the
danger
i
asked
why
progress
is
in
deeds
of
love
in
fulfilling
the
moral
law
if
you
do
enslave
anyone
if
you
do
oppress
anyone
what
further
progress
do
you
want
but
excuse
me
blagovo
suddenly
fired
up
rising
to
his
feet
but
excuse
me
if
a
snail
in
its
shell
busies
itself
over
perfecting
its
own
personality
and
muddles
about
with
the
moral
law
do
you
call
that
progress
why
muddles
i
said
offended
if
you
do
force
your
neighbour
to
feed
and
clothe
you
to
transport
you
from
place
to
place
and
defend
you
from
your
enemies
surely
in
the
midst
of
a
life
entirely
resting
on
slavery
that
is
progress
is
it
to
my
mind
it
is
the
most
important
progress
and
perhaps
the
only
one
possible
and
necessary
for
man
the
limits
of
universal
world
progress
are
in
infinity
and
to
talk
of
some
progress
limited
by
our
needs
and
temporary
theories
is
excuse
my
saying
so
positively
strange
if
the
limits
of
progress
are
in
infinity
as
you
say
it
follows
that
its
aims
are
not
definite
i
said
to
live
without
knowing
definitely
what
you
are
living
for
so
be
it
but
that
knowing
is
not
so
dull
as
your
i
am
going
up
a
ladder
which
is
called
progress
civilization
culture
i
go
on
and
up
without
knowing
definitely
where
i
am
going
but
really
it
is
worth
living
for
the
sake
of
that
delightful
ladder
while
you
know
what
you
are
living
for
you
live
for
the
sake
of
some
people
not
enslaving
others
that
the
artist
and
the
man
who
rubs
his
paints
may
dine
equally
well
but
you
know
that
the
petty
bourgeois
kitchen
grey
side
of
life
and
surely
it
is
revolting
to
live
for
that
alone
if
some
insects
do
enslave
others
bother
them
let
them
devour
each
other
we
need
not
think
about
them
you
know
they
will
die
and
decay
just
the
same
however
zealously
you
rescue
them
from
slavery
we
must
think
of
that
great
millennium
which
awaits
humanity
in
the
remote
future
blagovo
argued
warmly
with
me
but
at
the
same
time
one
could
see
he
was
troubled
by
some
irrelevant
idea
i
suppose
your
sister
is
not
coming
he
said
looking
at
his
watch
she
was
at
our
house
yesterday
and
said
she
would
be
seeing
you
you
keep
saying
slavery
slavery
he
went
on
but
you
know
that
is
a
special
question
and
all
such
questions
are
solved
by
humanity
gradually
we
began
talking
of
doing
things
gradually
i
said
that
the
question
of
doing
good
or
evil
every
one
settles
for
himself
without
waiting
till
humanity
settles
it
by
the
way
of
gradual
development
moreover
this
gradual
process
has
more
than
one
aspect
side
by
side
with
the
gradual
development
of
human
ideas
the
gradual
growth
of
ideas
of
another
order
is
observed
serfdom
is
no
more
but
the
capitalist
system
is
growing
and
in
the
very
heyday
of
emancipating
ideas
just
as
in
the
days
of
baty
the
majority
feeds
clothes
and
defends
the
minority
while
remaining
hungry
inadequately
clad
and
defenceless
such
an
order
of
things
can
be
made
to
fit
in
finely
with
any
tendencies
and
currents
of
thought
you
like
because
the
art
of
enslaving
is
also
gradually
being
cultivated
we
no
longer
flog
our
servants
in
the
stable
but
we
give
to
slavery
refined
forms
at
least
we
succeed
in
finding
a
justification
for
it
in
each
particular
case
ideas
are
ideas
with
us
but
if
now
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
were
possible
to
lay
the
burden
of
the
most
unpleasant
of
our
physiological
functions
upon
the
working
class
we
should
certainly
do
so
and
afterwards
of
course
justify
ourselves
by
saying
that
if
the
best
people
the
thinkers
and
great
scientists
were
to
waste
their
precious
time
on
these
functions
progress
might
be
menaced
with
great
danger
but
at
this
point
my
sister
arrived
seeing
the
doctor
she
was
fluttered
and
troubled
and
began
saying
immediately
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
home
to
her
father
kleopatra
alexyevna
said
blagovo
earnestly
pressing
both
hands
to
his
heart
what
will
happen
to
your
father
if
you
spend
half
an
hour
or
so
with
your
brother
and
me
he
was
frank
and
knew
how
to
communicate
his
liveliness
to
others
after
a
moment
thought
my
sister
laughed
and
all
at
once
became
suddenly
gay
as
she
had
been
at
the
picnic
we
went
out
into
the
country
and
lying
in
the
grass
went
on
with
our
talk
and
looked
towards
the
town
where
all
the
windows
facing
west
were
like
glittering
gold
because
the
sun
was
setting
after
that
whenever
my
sister
was
coming
to
see
me
blagovo
turned
up
too
and
they
always
greeted
each
other
as
though
their
meeting
in
my
room
was
accidental
my
sister
listened
while
the
doctor
and
i
argued
and
at
such
times
her
expression
was
joyfully
enthusiastic
full
of
tenderness
and
curiosity
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
new
world
she
had
never
dreamed
of
before
and
which
she
was
now
striving
to
fathom
was
gradually
opening
before
her
eyes
when
the
doctor
was
not
there
she
was
quiet
and
sad
and
now
if
she
sometimes
shed
tears
as
she
sat
on
my
bed
it
was
for
reasons
of
which
she
did
not
speak
in
august
radish
ordered
us
to
be
ready
to
go
to
the
two
days
before
we
were
banished
from
the
town
my
father
came
to
see
me
he
sat
down
and
in
a
leisurely
way
without
looking
at
me
wiped
his
red
face
then
took
out
of
his
pocket
our
town
and
deliberately
with
emphasis
on
each
word
read
out
the
news
that
the
son
of
the
branch
manager
of
the
state
bank
a
young
man
of
my
age
had
been
appointed
head
of
a
department
in
the
exchequer
and
now
look
at
you
he
said
folding
up
the
newspaper
a
beggar
in
rags
good
for
nothing
even
people
and
peasants
obtain
education
in
order
to
become
men
while
you
a
poloznev
with
ancestors
of
rank
and
distinction
aspire
to
the
gutter
but
i
have
not
come
here
to
talk
to
you
i
have
washed
my
hands
of
you
he
added
in
a
stifled
voice
getting
up
i
have
come
to
find
out
where
your
sister
is
you
worthless
fellow
she
left
home
after
dinner
and
here
it
is
nearly
eight
and
she
is
not
back
she
has
taken
to
going
out
frequently
without
telling
me
she
is
less
dutiful
and
i
see
in
it
your
evil
and
degrading
influence
where
is
she
in
his
hand
he
had
the
umbrella
i
knew
so
well
and
i
was
already
flustered
and
drew
myself
up
like
a
schoolboy
expecting
my
father
to
begin
hitting
me
with
it
but
he
noticed
my
glance
at
the
umbrella
and
most
likely
that
restrained
him
live
as
you
please
he
said
i
shall
not
give
you
my
blessing
holy
saints
my
nurse
muttered
behind
the
door
you
poor
unlucky
child
ah
my
heart
bodes
ill
i
worked
on
the
it
rained
without
stopping
all
august
it
was
damp
and
cold
they
had
not
carried
the
corn
in
the
fields
and
on
big
farms
where
the
wheat
had
been
cut
by
machines
it
lay
not
in
sheaves
but
in
heaps
and
i
remember
how
those
luckless
heaps
of
wheat
turned
blacker
every
day
and
the
grain
was
sprouting
in
them
it
was
hard
to
work
the
pouring
rain
spoiled
everything
we
managed
to
do
we
were
not
allowed
to
live
or
to
sleep
in
the
railway
buildings
and
we
took
refuge
in
the
damp
and
filthy
mud
huts
in
which
the
navvies
had
lived
during
the
summer
and
i
could
not
sleep
at
night
for
the
cold
and
the
woodlice
crawling
on
my
face
and
hands
and
when
we
worked
near
the
bridges
the
navvies
used
to
come
in
the
evenings
in
a
gang
simply
in
order
to
beat
the
painters
it
was
a
form
of
sport
to
them
they
used
to
beat
us
to
steal
our
brushes
and
to
annoy
us
and
rouse
us
to
fight
they
used
to
spoil
our
work
they
would
for
instance
smear
over
the
signal
boxes
with
green
paint
to
complete
our
troubles
radish
took
to
paying
us
very
irregularly
all
the
painting
work
on
the
line
was
given
out
to
a
contractor
he
gave
it
out
to
another
and
this
subcontractor
gave
it
to
radish
after
subtracting
twenty
per
cent
for
himself
the
job
was
not
a
profitable
one
in
itself
and
the
rain
made
it
worse
time
was
wasted
we
could
not
work
while
radish
was
obliged
to
pay
the
fellows
by
the
day
the
hungry
painters
almost
came
to
beating
him
called
him
a
cheat
a
a
judas
while
he
poor
fellow
sighed
lifted
up
his
hand
to
heaven
in
despair
and
was
continually
going
to
madame
tcheprakov
for
money
vii
autumn
came
on
rainy
dark
and
muddy
the
season
of
unemployment
set
in
and
i
used
to
sit
at
home
out
of
work
for
three
days
at
a
stretch
or
did
various
little
jobs
not
in
the
painting
line
for
instance
i
wheeled
earth
earning
about
fourpence
a
day
by
it
blagovo
had
gone
away
to
petersburg
my
sister
had
given
up
coming
to
see
me
radish
was
laid
up
at
home
ill
expecting
death
from
day
to
day
and
my
mood
was
autumnal
too
perhaps
because
having
become
a
workman
i
saw
our
town
life
only
from
the
seamy
side
it
was
my
lot
almost
every
day
to
make
discoveries
which
reduced
me
almost
to
despair
those
of
my
about
whom
i
had
no
opinion
before
or
who
had
externally
appeared
perfectly
decent
turned
out
now
to
be
base
cruel
people
capable
of
any
dirty
action
we
common
people
were
deceived
cheated
and
kept
waiting
for
hours
together
in
the
cold
entry
or
the
kitchen
we
were
insulted
and
treated
with
the
utmost
rudeness
in
the
autumn
i
papered
the
and
two
other
rooms
at
the
club
i
was
paid
a
penny
the
piece
but
had
to
sign
a
receipt
at
the
rate
of
twopence
halfpenny
and
when
i
refused
to
do
so
a
gentleman
of
benevolent
appearance
in
spectacles
who
must
have
been
one
of
the
club
committee
said
to
me
if
you
say
much
more
you
blackguard
i
pound
your
face
into
a
jelly
and
when
the
flunkey
whispered
to
him
what
i
was
the
son
of
poloznev
the
architect
he
became
embarrassed
turned
crimson
but
immediately
recovered
himself
and
said
devil
take
him
in
the
shops
they
palmed
off
on
us
workmen
putrid
meat
musty
flour
and
tea
that
had
been
used
and
dried
again
the
police
hustled
us
in
church
the
assistants
and
nurses
in
the
hospital
plundered
us
and
if
we
were
too
poor
to
give
them
a
bribe
they
revenged
themselves
by
bringing
us
food
in
dirty
vessels
in
the
the
pettiest
official
considered
he
had
a
right
to
treat
us
like
animals
and
to
shout
with
coarse
insolence
you
wait
where
are
you
shoving
to
even
the
housedogs
were
unfriendly
to
us
and
fell
upon
us
with
peculiar
viciousness
but
the
thing
that
struck
me
most
of
all
in
my
new
position
was
the
complete
lack
of
justice
what
is
defined
by
the
peasants
in
the
words
they
have
forgotten
god
rarely
did
a
day
pass
without
swindling
we
were
swindled
by
the
merchants
who
sold
us
oil
by
the
contractors
and
the
workmen
and
the
people
who
employed
us
i
need
not
say
that
there
could
never
be
a
question
of
our
rights
and
we
always
had
to
ask
for
the
money
we
earned
as
though
it
were
a
charity
and
to
stand
waiting
for
it
at
the
back
door
cap
in
hand
i
was
papering
a
room
at
the
club
next
to
the
in
the
evening
when
i
was
just
getting
ready
to
go
the
daughter
of
dolzhikov
the
engineer
walked
into
the
room
with
a
bundle
of
books
under
her
arm
i
bowed
to
her
oh
how
do
you
do
she
said
recognizing
me
at
once
and
holding
out
her
hand
i
very
glad
to
see
you
she
smiled
and
looked
with
curiosity
and
wonder
at
my
smock
my
pail
of
paste
the
paper
stretched
on
the
floor
i
was
embarrassed
and
she
too
felt
awkward
you
must
excuse
my
looking
at
you
like
this
she
said
i
have
been
told
so
much
about
you
especially
by
blagovo
he
is
simply
in
love
with
you
and
i
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
your
sister
too
a
sweet
dear
girl
but
i
can
never
persuade
her
that
there
is
nothing
awful
about
your
adopting
the
simple
life
on
the
contrary
you
have
become
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
town
she
looked
again
at
the
pail
of
paste
and
the
wallpaper
and
went
on
i
asked
blagovo
to
make
me
better
acquainted
with
you
but
apparently
he
forgot
or
had
not
time
anyway
we
are
acquainted
all
the
same
and
if
you
would
come
and
see
me
quite
simply
i
should
be
extremely
indebted
to
you
i
so
long
to
have
a
talk
i
am
a
simple
person
she
added
holding
out
her
hand
to
me
and
i
hope
that
you
will
feel
no
constraint
with
me
my
father
is
not
here
he
is
in
petersburg
she
went
off
into
the
rustling
her
skirts
while
i
went
home
and
for
a
long
time
could
not
get
to
sleep
that
cheerless
autumn
some
kind
soul
evidently
wishing
to
alleviate
my
existence
sent
me
from
time
to
time
tea
and
lemons
or
biscuits
or
roast
game
karpovna
told
me
that
they
were
always
brought
by
a
soldier
and
from
whom
they
came
she
did
not
know
and
the
soldier
used
to
enquire
whether
i
was
well
and
whether
i
dined
every
day
and
whether
i
had
warm
clothing
when
the
frosts
began
i
was
presented
in
the
same
way
in
my
absence
with
a
soft
knitted
scarf
brought
by
the
soldier
there
was
a
faint
elusive
smell
of
scent
about
it
and
i
guessed
who
my
good
fairy
was
the
scarf
smelt
of
the
favourite
scent
of
anyuta
blagovo
towards
winter
there
was
more
work
and
it
was
more
cheerful
radish
recovered
and
we
worked
together
in
the
cemetery
church
where
we
were
putting
the
on
the
before
gilding
it
was
a
clean
quiet
job
and
as
our
fellows
used
to
say
profitable
one
could
get
through
a
lot
of
work
in
a
day
and
the
time
passed
quickly
imperceptibly
there
was
no
swearing
no
laughter
no
loud
talk
the
place
itself
compelled
one
to
quietness
and
decent
behaviour
and
disposed
one
to
quiet
serious
thoughts
absorbed
in
our
work
we
stood
or
sat
motionless
like
statues
there
was
a
deathly
silence
in
keeping
with
the
cemetery
so
that
if
a
tool
fell
or
a
flame
spluttered
in
the
lamp
the
noise
of
such
sounds
rang
out
abrupt
and
resonant
and
made
us
look
round
after
a
long
silence
we
would
hear
a
buzzing
like
the
swarming
of
bees
it
was
the
requiem
of
a
baby
being
chanted
slowly
in
subdued
voices
in
the
porch
or
an
artist
painting
a
dove
with
stars
round
it
on
a
cupola
would
begin
softly
whistling
and
recollecting
himself
with
a
start
would
at
once
relapse
into
silence
or
radish
answering
his
thoughts
would
say
with
a
sigh
anything
is
possible
anything
is
possible
or
a
slow
disconsolate
bell
would
begin
ringing
over
our
heads
and
the
painters
would
observe
that
it
must
be
for
the
funeral
of
some
wealthy
person
my
days
i
spent
in
this
stillness
in
the
twilight
of
the
church
and
in
the
long
evenings
i
played
billiards
or
went
to
the
theatre
in
the
gallery
wearing
the
new
trousers
i
had
bought
out
of
my
own
earnings
concerts
and
performances
had
already
begun
at
the
azhogins
radish
used
to
paint
the
scenes
alone
now
he
used
to
tell
me
the
plot
of
the
plays
and
describe
the
which
he
witnessed
i
listened
to
him
with
envy
i
felt
greatly
drawn
to
the
rehearsals
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
go
to
the
azhogins
a
week
before
christmas
blagovo
arrived
and
again
we
argued
and
played
billiards
in
the
evenings
when
he
played
he
used
to
take
off
his
coat
and
unbutton
his
shirt
over
his
chest
and
for
some
reason
tried
altogether
to
assume
the
air
of
a
desperate
rake
he
did
not
drink
much
but
made
a
great
uproar
about
it
and
had
a
special
faculty
for
getting
through
twenty
roubles
in
an
evening
at
such
a
poor
cheap
tavern
as
the
my
sister
began
coming
to
see
me
again
they
both
expressed
surprise
every
time
on
seeing
each
other
but
from
her
joyful
guilty
face
it
was
evident
that
these
meetings
were
not
accidental
one
evening
when
we
were
playing
billiards
the
doctor
said
to
me
i
say
why
do
you
go
and
see
miss
dolzhikov
you
do
know
mariya
viktorovna
she
is
a
clever
creature
a
charmer
a
simple
soul
i
described
how
her
father
had
received
me
in
the
spring
nonsense
laughed
the
doctor
the
engineer
one
thing
and
another
really
my
dear
fellow
you
must
be
nasty
to
her
go
and
see
her
sometimes
for
instance
let
go
and
see
her
tomorrow
evening
what
do
you
say
he
persuaded
me
the
next
evening
i
put
on
my
new
serge
trousers
and
in
some
agitation
i
set
off
to
miss
dolzhikov
the
footman
did
not
seem
so
haughty
and
terrible
nor
the
furniture
so
gorgeous
as
on
that
morning
when
i
had
come
to
ask
a
favour
mariya
viktorovna
was
expecting
me
and
she
received
me
like
an
old
acquaintance
shaking
hands
with
me
in
a
friendly
way
she
was
wearing
a
grey
cloth
dress
with
full
sleeves
and
had
her
hair
done
in
the
style
which
we
used
to
call
dogs
ears
when
it
came
into
fashion
in
the
town
a
year
before
the
hair
was
combed
down
over
the
ears
and
this
made
mariya
viktorovna
face
look
broader
and
she
seemed
to
me
this
time
very
much
like
her
father
whose
face
was
broad
and
red
with
something
in
its
expression
like
a
she
was
handsome
and
elegant
but
not
youthful
looking
she
looked
thirty
though
in
reality
she
was
not
more
than
dear
doctor
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
she
said
making
me
sit
down
if
it
had
been
for
him
you
would
have
come
to
see
me
i
am
bored
to
death
my
father
has
gone
away
and
left
me
alone
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
myself
in
this
town
then
she
began
asking
me
where
i
was
working
now
how
much
i
earned
where
i
lived
do
you
spend
on
yourself
nothing
but
what
you
earn
she
asked
no
happy
man
she
sighed
all
the
evil
in
life
it
seems
to
me
comes
from
idleness
boredom
and
spiritual
emptiness
and
all
this
is
inevitable
when
one
is
accustomed
to
living
at
other
expense
do
think
i
am
showing
off
i
tell
you
truthfully
it
is
not
interesting
or
pleasant
to
be
rich
to
yourselves
friends
of
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
is
said
because
there
is
not
and
can
not
be
a
mammon
that
righteous
she
looked
round
at
the
furniture
with
a
grave
cold
expression
as
though
she
wanted
to
count
it
over
and
went
on
comfort
and
luxury
have
a
magical
power
little
by
little
they
draw
into
their
clutches
even
people
at
one
time
father
and
i
lived
simply
not
in
a
rich
style
but
now
you
see
how
it
is
something
monstrous
she
said
shrugging
her
shoulders
we
spend
up
to
twenty
thousand
a
year
in
the
provinces
one
comes
to
look
at
comfort
and
luxury
as
the
invariable
privilege
of
capital
and
education
i
said
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
comforts
of
life
may
be
combined
with
any
sort
of
labour
even
the
hardest
and
dirtiest
your
father
is
rich
and
yet
he
says
himself
that
it
has
been
his
lot
to
be
a
mechanic
and
an
oiler
she
smiled
and
shook
her
head
doubtfully
my
father
sometimes
eats
bread
dipped
in
kvass
she
said
it
a
fancy
a
whim
at
that
moment
there
was
a
ring
and
she
got
up
the
rich
and
ought
to
work
like
everyone
else
she
said
and
if
there
is
comfort
it
ought
to
be
equal
for
all
there
ought
not
to
be
any
privileges
but
that
enough
philosophizing
tell
me
something
amusing
tell
me
about
the
painters
what
are
they
like
funny
the
doctor
came
in
i
began
telling
them
about
the
painters
but
being
unaccustomed
to
talking
i
was
constrained
and
described
them
like
an
ethnologist
gravely
and
tediously
the
doctor
too
told
us
some
anecdotes
of
working
men
he
staggered
about
shed
tears
dropped
on
his
knees
and
even
mimicking
a
drunkard
lay
on
the
floor
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
and
mariya
viktorovna
laughed
till
she
cried
as
she
looked
at
him
then
he
played
on
the
piano
and
sang
in
his
thin
pleasant
tenor
while
mariya
viktorovna
stood
by
and
picked
out
what
he
was
to
sing
and
corrected
him
when
he
made
a
mistake
i
heard
that
you
sing
too
i
enquired
sing
too
cried
the
doctor
in
horror
she
sings
exquisitely
a
perfect
artist
and
you
talk
of
her
too
what
an
idea
i
did
study
in
earnest
at
one
time
she
said
answering
my
question
but
now
i
have
given
it
up
sitting
on
a
low
stool
she
told
us
of
her
life
in
petersburg
and
mimicked
some
celebrated
singers
imitating
their
voice
and
manner
of
singing
she
made
a
sketch
of
the
doctor
in
her
album
then
of
me
she
did
not
draw
well
but
both
the
portraits
were
like
us
she
laughed
and
was
full
of
mischief
and
charming
grimaces
and
this
suited
her
better
than
talking
about
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
had
been
talking
just
before
about
wealth
and
luxury
not
in
earnest
but
in
imitation
of
someone
she
was
a
superb
comic
actress
i
mentally
compared
her
with
our
young
ladies
and
even
the
handsome
dignified
anyuta
blagovo
could
not
stand
comparison
with
her
the
difference
was
immense
like
the
difference
between
a
beautiful
cultivated
rose
and
a
wild
briar
we
had
supper
together
the
three
of
us
the
doctor
and
mariya
viktorovna
drank
red
wine
champagne
and
coffee
with
brandy
in
it
they
clinked
glasses
and
drank
to
friendship
to
enlightenment
to
progress
to
liberty
and
they
did
not
get
drunk
but
only
flushed
and
were
continually
for
no
reason
laughing
till
they
cried
so
as
not
to
be
tiresome
i
drank
claret
too
talented
richly
endowed
natures
said
miss
dolzhikov
know
how
to
live
and
go
their
own
way
mediocre
people
like
myself
for
instance
know
nothing
and
can
do
nothing
of
themselves
there
is
nothing
left
for
them
but
to
discern
some
deep
social
movement
and
to
float
where
they
are
carried
by
it
how
can
one
discern
what
does
exist
asked
the
doctor
we
think
so
because
we
do
see
it
is
that
so
the
social
movements
are
the
invention
of
the
new
literature
there
are
none
among
us
an
argument
began
there
are
no
deep
social
movements
among
us
and
never
have
been
the
doctor
declared
loudly
there
is
no
end
to
what
the
new
literature
has
invented
it
has
invented
intellectual
workers
in
the
country
and
you
may
search
through
all
our
villages
and
find
at
the
most
some
lout
in
a
reefer
jacket
or
a
black
who
will
make
four
mistakes
in
spelling
a
word
of
three
letters
cultured
life
has
not
yet
begun
among
us
there
the
same
savagery
the
same
uniform
boorishness
the
same
triviality
as
five
hundred
years
ago
movements
currents
there
have
been
but
it
has
all
been
petty
paltry
bent
upon
vulgar
and
mercenary
interests
and
one
can
not
see
anything
important
in
them
if
you
think
you
have
discerned
a
deep
social
movement
and
in
following
it
you
devote
yourself
to
tasks
in
the
modern
taste
such
as
the
emancipation
of
insects
from
slavery
or
abstinence
from
beef
rissoles
i
congratulate
you
madam
we
must
study
and
study
and
study
and
we
must
wait
a
bit
with
our
deep
social
movements
we
are
not
mature
enough
for
them
yet
and
to
tell
the
truth
we
do
know
anything
about
them
you
do
know
anything
about
them
but
i
do
said
mariya
viktorovna
goodness
how
tiresome
you
are
our
duty
is
to
study
and
to
study
to
try
to
accumulate
as
much
knowledge
as
possible
for
genuine
social
movements
arise
where
there
is
knowledge
and
the
happiness
of
mankind
in
the
future
lies
only
in
knowledge
i
drink
to
science
there
is
no
doubt
about
one
thing
one
must
organize
one
life
somehow
differently
said
mariya
viktorovna
after
a
silence
and
thought
life
such
as
it
has
been
hitherto
is
not
worth
having
do
let
us
talk
about
it
as
we
came
away
from
her
the
cathedral
clock
struck
two
did
you
like
her
asked
the
doctor
she
nice
is
she
on
christmas
day
we
dined
with
mariya
viktorovna
and
all
through
the
holidays
we
went
to
see
her
almost
every
day
there
was
never
anyone
there
but
ourselves
and
she
was
right
when
she
said
that
she
had
no
friends
in
the
town
but
the
doctor
and
me
we
spent
our
time
for
the
most
part
in
conversation
sometimes
the
doctor
brought
some
book
or
magazine
and
read
aloud
to
us
in
reality
he
was
the
first
man
i
had
met
in
my
life
i
can
not
judge
whether
he
knew
a
great
deal
but
he
always
displayed
his
knowledge
as
though
he
wanted
other
people
to
share
it
when
he
talked
about
anything
relating
to
medicine
he
was
not
like
any
one
of
the
doctors
in
our
town
but
made
a
fresh
peculiar
impression
upon
me
and
i
fancied
that
if
he
liked
he
might
have
become
a
real
man
of
science
and
he
was
perhaps
the
only
person
who
had
a
real
influence
upon
me
at
that
time
seeing
him
and
reading
the
books
he
gave
me
i
began
little
by
little
to
feel
a
thirst
for
the
knowledge
which
would
have
given
significance
to
my
cheerless
labour
it
seemed
strange
to
me
for
instance
that
i
had
not
known
till
then
that
the
whole
world
was
made
up
of
sixty
elements
i
had
not
known
what
oil
was
what
paints
were
and
that
i
could
have
got
on
without
knowing
these
things
my
acquaintance
with
the
doctor
elevated
me
morally
too
i
was
continually
arguing
with
him
and
though
i
usually
remained
of
my
own
opinion
yet
thanks
to
him
i
began
to
perceive
that
everything
was
not
clear
to
me
and
i
began
trying
to
work
out
as
far
as
i
could
definite
convictions
in
myself
that
the
dictates
of
conscience
might
be
definite
and
that
there
might
be
nothing
vague
in
my
mind
yet
though
he
was
the
most
cultivated
and
best
man
in
the
town
he
was
nevertheless
far
from
perfection
in
his
manners
in
his
habit
of
turning
every
conversation
into
an
argument
in
his
pleasant
tenor
even
in
his
friendliness
there
was
something
coarse
like
a
divinity
student
and
when
he
took
off
his
coat
and
sat
in
his
silk
shirt
or
flung
a
tip
to
a
waiter
in
the
restaurant
i
always
fancied
that
culture
might
be
all
very
well
but
the
tatar
was
fermenting
in
him
still
at
epiphany
he
went
back
to
petersburg
he
went
off
in
the
morning
and
after
dinner
my
sister
came
in
without
taking
off
her
fur
coat
and
her
cap
she
sat
down
in
silence
very
pale
and
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
same
spot
she
was
chilled
by
the
frost
and
one
could
see
that
she
was
upset
by
it
you
must
have
caught
cold
i
said
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
got
up
and
went
out
to
karpovna
without
saying
a
word
to
me
as
though
i
had
hurt
her
feelings
and
a
little
later
i
heard
her
saying
in
a
tone
of
bitter
reproach
nurse
what
have
i
been
living
for
till
now
what
tell
me
i
wasted
my
youth
all
the
best
years
of
my
life
to
know
nothing
but
keeping
accounts
pouring
out
tea
counting
the
halfpence
entertaining
visitors
and
thinking
there
was
nothing
better
in
the
world
nurse
do
understand
i
have
the
cravings
of
a
human
being
and
i
want
to
live
and
they
have
turned
me
into
something
like
a
housekeeper
it
horrible
horrible
she
flung
her
keys
towards
the
door
and
they
fell
with
a
jingle
into
my
room
they
were
the
keys
of
the
sideboard
of
the
kitchen
cupboard
of
the
cellar
and
of
the
the
keys
which
my
mother
used
to
carry
oh
merciful
heavens
cried
the
old
woman
in
horror
holy
saints
above
before
going
home
my
sister
came
into
my
room
to
pick
up
the
keys
and
said
you
must
forgive
me
something
queer
has
happened
to
me
lately
viii
on
returning
home
late
one
evening
from
mariya
viktorovna
i
found
waiting
in
my
room
a
young
police
inspector
in
a
new
uniform
he
was
sitting
at
my
table
looking
through
my
books
at
last
he
said
getting
up
and
stretching
himself
this
is
the
third
time
i
have
been
to
you
the
governor
commands
you
to
present
yourself
before
him
at
nine
in
the
morning
without
fail
he
took
from
me
a
signed
statement
that
i
would
act
upon
his
excellency
command
and
went
away
this
late
visit
of
the
police
inspector
and
unexpected
invitation
to
the
governor
had
an
overwhelmingly
oppressive
effect
upon
me
from
my
earliest
childhood
i
have
felt
in
the
presence
of
gendarmes
policemen
and
law
court
officials
and
now
i
was
tormented
by
uneasiness
as
though
i
were
really
guilty
in
some
way
and
i
could
not
get
to
sleep
my
nurse
and
prokofy
were
also
upset
and
could
not
sleep
my
nurse
had
earache
too
she
moaned
and
several
times
began
crying
with
pain
hearing
that
i
was
awake
prokofy
came
into
my
room
with
a
lamp
and
sat
down
at
the
table
you
ought
to
have
a
drink
of
pepper
cordial
he
said
after
a
moment
thought
if
one
does
have
a
drink
in
this
vale
of
tears
it
does
no
harm
and
if
mamma
were
to
pour
a
little
pepper
cordial
in
her
ear
it
would
do
her
a
lot
of
good
between
two
and
three
he
was
going
to
the
for
the
meat
i
knew
i
should
not
sleep
till
morning
now
and
to
get
through
the
time
till
nine
i
went
with
him
we
walked
with
a
lantern
while
his
boy
nikolka
aged
thirteen
with
blue
patches
on
his
cheeks
from
frostbites
a
regular
young
brigand
to
judge
by
his
expression
drove
after
us
in
the
sledge
urging
on
the
horse
in
a
husky
voice
i
suppose
they
will
punish
you
at
the
governor
prokofy
said
to
me
on
the
way
there
are
rules
of
the
trade
for
governors
and
rules
for
the
higher
clergy
and
rules
for
the
officers
and
rules
for
the
doctors
and
every
class
has
its
rules
but
you
kept
to
your
rules
and
you
ca
be
allowed
the
was
behind
the
cemetery
and
till
then
i
had
only
seen
it
in
the
distance
it
consisted
of
three
gloomy
barns
surrounded
by
a
grey
fence
and
when
the
wind
blew
from
that
quarter
on
hot
days
in
summer
it
brought
a
stifling
stench
from
them
now
going
into
the
yard
in
the
dark
i
did
not
see
the
barns
i
kept
coming
across
horses
and
sledges
some
empty
some
loaded
up
with
meat
men
were
walking
about
with
lanterns
swearing
in
a
disgusting
way
prokofy
and
nikolka
swore
just
as
revoltingly
and
the
air
was
in
a
continual
uproar
with
swearing
coughing
and
the
neighing
of
horses
there
was
a
smell
of
dead
bodies
and
of
dung
it
was
thawing
the
snow
was
changing
into
mud
and
in
the
darkness
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
walking
through
pools
of
blood
having
piled
up
the
sledges
full
of
meat
we
set
off
to
the
shop
in
the
market
it
began
to
get
light
cooks
with
baskets
and
elderly
ladies
in
mantles
came
along
one
after
another
prokofy
with
a
chopper
in
his
hand
in
a
white
apron
spattered
with
blood
swore
fearful
oaths
crossed
himself
at
the
church
shouted
aloud
for
the
whole
market
to
hear
that
he
was
giving
away
the
meat
at
cost
price
and
even
at
a
loss
to
himself
he
gave
short
weight
and
short
change
the
cooks
saw
that
but
deafened
by
his
shouts
did
not
protest
and
only
called
him
a
hangman
brandishing
and
bringing
down
his
terrible
chopper
he
threw
himself
into
picturesque
attitudes
and
each
time
uttered
the
sound
geck
with
a
ferocious
expression
and
i
was
afraid
he
really
would
chop
off
somebody
head
or
hand
i
spent
all
the
morning
in
the
butcher
shop
and
when
at
last
i
went
to
the
governor
my
overcoat
smelt
of
meat
and
blood
my
state
of
mind
was
as
though
i
were
being
sent
spear
in
hand
to
meet
a
bear
i
remember
the
tall
staircase
with
a
striped
carpet
on
it
and
the
young
official
with
shiny
buttons
who
mutely
motioned
me
to
the
door
with
both
hands
and
ran
to
announce
me
i
went
into
a
hall
luxuriously
but
frigidly
and
tastelessly
furnished
and
the
high
narrow
mirrors
in
the
spaces
between
the
walls
and
the
bright
yellow
window
curtains
struck
the
eye
particularly
unpleasantly
one
could
see
that
the
governors
were
changed
but
the
furniture
remained
the
same
again
the
young
official
motioned
me
with
both
hands
to
the
door
and
i
went
up
to
a
big
green
table
at
which
a
military
general
with
the
order
of
vladimir
on
his
breast
was
standing
poloznev
i
have
asked
you
to
come
he
began
holding
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
opening
his
mouth
like
a
round
o
i
have
asked
you
to
come
here
to
inform
you
of
this
your
highly
respected
father
has
appealed
by
letter
and
by
word
of
mouth
to
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
begging
him
to
summon
you
and
to
lay
before
you
the
inconsistency
of
your
behaviour
with
the
rank
of
the
nobility
to
which
you
have
the
honour
to
belong
his
excellency
alexandr
pavlovitch
justly
supposing
that
your
conduct
might
serve
as
a
bad
example
and
considering
that
mere
persuasion
on
his
part
would
not
be
sufficient
but
that
official
intervention
in
earnest
was
essential
presents
me
here
in
this
letter
with
his
views
in
regard
to
you
which
i
share
he
said
this
quietly
respectfully
standing
erect
as
though
i
were
his
superior
officer
and
looking
at
me
with
no
trace
of
severity
his
face
looked
worn
and
wizened
and
was
all
wrinkles
there
were
bags
under
his
eyes
his
hair
was
dyed
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
his
appearance
how
old
he
was
forty
or
sixty
i
trust
he
went
on
that
you
appreciate
the
delicacy
of
our
honoured
alexandr
pavlovitch
who
has
addressed
himself
to
me
not
officially
but
privately
i
too
have
asked
you
to
come
here
unofficially
and
i
am
speaking
to
you
not
as
a
governor
but
from
a
sincere
regard
for
your
father
and
so
i
beg
you
either
to
alter
your
line
of
conduct
and
return
to
duties
in
keeping
with
your
rank
or
to
avoid
setting
a
bad
example
remove
to
another
district
where
you
are
not
known
and
where
you
can
follow
any
occupation
you
please
in
the
other
case
i
shall
be
forced
to
take
extreme
measures
he
stood
for
half
a
minute
in
silence
looking
at
me
with
his
mouth
open
are
you
a
vegetarian
he
asked
no
your
excellency
i
eat
meat
he
sat
down
and
drew
some
papers
towards
him
i
bowed
and
went
out
it
was
not
worth
while
now
to
go
to
work
before
dinner
i
went
home
to
sleep
but
could
not
sleep
from
an
unpleasant
sickly
feeling
induced
by
the
slaughter
house
and
my
conversation
with
the
governor
and
when
the
evening
came
i
went
gloomy
and
out
of
sorts
to
mariya
viktorovna
i
told
her
how
i
had
been
at
the
governor
while
she
stared
at
me
in
perplexity
as
though
she
did
not
believe
it
then
suddenly
began
laughing
gaily
loudly
irrepressibly
as
only
people
can
if
only
one
could
tell
that
in
petersburg
she
brought
out
almost
falling
over
with
laughter
and
propping
herself
against
the
table
if
one
could
tell
that
in
petersburg
ix
now
we
used
to
see
each
other
often
sometimes
twice
a
day
she
used
to
come
to
the
cemetery
almost
every
day
after
dinner
and
read
the
epitaphs
on
the
crosses
and
tombstones
while
she
waited
for
me
sometimes
she
would
come
into
the
church
and
standing
by
me
would
look
on
while
i
worked
the
stillness
the
naïve
work
of
the
painters
and
gilders
radish
sage
reflections
and
the
fact
that
i
did
not
differ
externally
from
the
other
workmen
and
worked
just
as
they
did
in
my
waistcoat
with
no
socks
on
and
that
i
was
addressed
familiarly
by
them
all
this
was
new
to
her
and
touched
her
one
day
a
workman
who
was
painting
a
dove
on
the
ceiling
called
out
to
me
in
her
presence
misail
hand
me
up
the
white
paint
i
took
him
the
white
paint
and
afterwards
when
i
let
myself
down
by
the
frail
scaffolding
she
looked
at
me
touched
to
tears
and
smiling
what
a
dear
you
are
she
said
i
remembered
from
my
childhood
how
a
green
parrot
belonging
to
one
of
the
rich
men
of
the
town
had
escaped
from
its
cage
and
how
for
quite
a
month
afterwards
the
beautiful
bird
had
haunted
the
town
flying
from
garden
to
garden
homeless
and
solitary
mariya
viktorovna
reminded
me
of
that
bird
there
is
positively
nowhere
for
me
to
go
now
but
the
cemetery
she
said
to
me
with
a
laugh
the
town
has
become
disgustingly
dull
at
the
azhogins
they
are
still
reciting
singing
lisping
i
have
grown
to
detest
them
of
late
your
sister
is
an
unsociable
creature
mademoiselle
blagovo
hates
me
for
some
reason
i
do
care
for
the
theatre
tell
me
where
am
i
to
go
when
i
went
to
see
her
i
smelt
of
paint
and
turpentine
and
my
hands
were
stained
and
she
liked
that
she
wanted
me
to
come
to
her
in
my
ordinary
working
clothes
but
in
her
those
clothes
made
me
feel
awkward
i
felt
embarrassed
as
though
i
were
in
uniform
so
i
always
put
on
my
new
serge
trousers
when
i
went
to
her
and
she
did
not
like
that
you
must
own
you
are
not
quite
at
home
in
your
new
character
she
said
to
me
one
day
your
workman
dress
does
not
feel
natural
to
you
you
are
awkward
in
it
tell
me
is
that
because
you
a
firm
conviction
and
are
not
satisfied
the
very
kind
of
work
you
have
chosen
your
painting
surely
it
does
not
satisfy
you
does
it
she
asked
laughing
i
know
paint
makes
things
look
nicer
and
last
longer
but
those
things
belong
to
rich
people
who
live
in
towns
and
after
all
they
are
luxuries
besides
you
have
often
said
yourself
that
everybody
ought
to
get
his
bread
by
the
work
of
his
own
hands
yet
you
get
money
and
not
bread
why
should
you
keep
to
the
literal
sense
of
your
words
you
ought
to
be
getting
bread
that
is
you
ought
to
be
ploughing
sowing
reaping
threshing
or
doing
something
which
has
a
direct
connection
with
agriculture
for
instance
looking
after
cows
digging
building
huts
of
logs
she
opened
a
pretty
cupboard
that
stood
near
her
and
said
i
am
saying
all
this
to
you
because
i
want
to
let
you
into
my
secret
this
is
my
agricultural
library
here
i
have
fields
kitchen
garden
and
orchard
and
cattleyard
and
beehives
i
read
them
greedily
and
have
already
learnt
all
the
theory
to
the
tiniest
detail
my
dream
my
darling
wish
is
to
go
to
our
dubetchnya
as
soon
as
march
is
here
it
marvellous
there
exquisite
is
it
the
first
year
i
shall
have
a
look
round
and
get
into
things
and
the
year
after
i
shall
begin
to
work
properly
myself
putting
my
back
into
it
as
they
say
my
father
has
promised
to
give
me
dubetchnya
and
i
shall
do
exactly
what
i
like
with
it
flushed
excited
to
tears
and
laughing
she
dreamed
aloud
how
she
would
live
at
dubetchnya
and
what
an
interesting
life
it
would
be
i
envied
her
march
was
near
the
days
were
growing
longer
and
longer
and
on
bright
sunny
days
water
dripped
from
the
roofs
at
midday
and
there
was
a
fragrance
of
spring
i
too
longed
for
the
country
and
when
she
said
that
she
should
move
to
dubetchnya
i
realized
vividly
that
i
should
remain
in
the
town
alone
and
i
felt
that
i
envied
her
with
her
cupboard
of
books
and
her
agriculture
i
knew
nothing
of
work
on
the
land
and
did
not
like
it
and
i
should
have
liked
to
have
told
her
that
work
on
the
land
was
slavish
toil
but
i
remembered
that
something
similar
had
been
said
more
than
once
by
my
father
and
i
held
my
tongue
lent
began
viktor
ivanitch
whose
existence
i
had
begun
to
forget
arrived
from
petersburg
he
arrived
unexpectedly
without
even
a
telegram
to
say
he
was
coming
when
i
went
in
as
usual
in
the
evening
he
was
walking
about
the
telling
some
story
with
his
face
freshly
washed
and
shaven
looking
ten
years
younger
his
daughter
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
taking
out
of
his
trunks
boxes
bottles
and
books
and
handing
them
to
pavel
the
footman
i
involuntarily
drew
back
a
step
when
i
saw
the
engineer
but
he
held
out
both
hands
to
me
and
said
smiling
showing
his
strong
white
teeth
that
looked
like
a
here
he
is
here
he
is
very
glad
to
see
you
masha
has
told
me
all
about
it
she
has
been
singing
your
praises
i
quite
understand
and
approve
he
went
on
taking
my
arm
to
be
a
good
workman
is
ever
so
much
more
honest
and
more
sensible
than
wasting
government
paper
and
wearing
a
cockade
on
your
head
i
myself
worked
in
belgium
with
these
very
hands
and
then
spent
two
years
as
a
mechanic
he
was
wearing
a
short
reefer
jacket
and
indoor
slippers
he
walked
like
a
man
with
the
gout
rolling
slightly
from
side
to
side
and
rubbing
his
hands
humming
something
he
softly
purred
and
hugged
himself
with
satisfaction
at
being
at
home
again
at
last
and
able
to
have
his
beloved
shower
bath
there
is
no
disputing
he
said
to
me
at
supper
there
is
no
disputing
you
are
all
nice
and
charming
people
but
for
some
reason
as
soon
as
you
take
to
manual
labour
or
go
in
for
saving
the
peasants
in
the
long
run
it
all
comes
to
no
more
than
being
a
dissenter
are
you
a
dissenter
here
you
do
take
vodka
the
meaning
of
that
if
it
is
not
being
a
dissenter
to
satisfy
him
i
drank
some
vodka
and
i
drank
some
wine
too
we
tasted
the
cheese
the
sausage
the
pâtés
the
pickles
and
the
savouries
of
all
sorts
that
the
engineer
had
brought
with
him
and
the
wine
that
had
come
in
his
absence
from
abroad
the
wine
was
for
some
reason
the
engineer
got
wine
and
cigars
from
abroad
without
paying
duty
the
caviare
and
the
dried
sturgeon
someone
sent
him
for
nothing
he
did
not
pay
rent
for
his
flat
as
the
owner
of
the
house
provided
the
kerosene
for
the
line
and
altogether
he
and
his
daughter
produced
on
me
the
impression
that
all
the
best
in
the
world
was
at
their
service
and
provided
for
them
for
nothing
i
went
on
going
to
see
them
but
not
with
the
same
eagerness
the
engineer
made
me
feel
constrained
and
in
his
presence
i
did
not
feel
free
i
could
not
face
his
clear
guileless
eyes
his
reflections
wearied
and
sickened
me
i
was
sickened
too
by
the
memory
that
so
lately
i
had
been
in
the
employment
of
this
man
and
that
he
had
been
brutally
rude
to
me
it
is
true
that
he
put
his
arm
round
my
waist
slapped
me
on
the
shoulder
in
a
friendly
way
approved
my
manner
of
life
but
i
felt
that
as
before
he
despised
my
insignificance
and
only
put
up
with
me
to
please
his
daughter
and
i
could
now
laugh
and
talk
as
i
liked
and
i
behaved
unsociably
and
kept
expecting
that
in
another
minute
he
would
address
me
as
panteley
as
he
did
his
footman
pavel
how
my
pride
as
a
provincial
and
a
working
man
was
revolted
i
a
proletarian
a
house
painter
went
every
day
to
rich
people
who
were
alien
to
me
and
whom
the
whole
town
regarded
as
though
they
were
foreigners
and
every
day
i
drank
costly
wines
with
them
and
ate
unusual
dainties
my
conscience
refused
to
be
reconciled
to
it
on
my
way
to
the
house
i
sullenly
avoided
meeting
people
and
looked
at
them
from
under
my
brows
as
though
i
really
were
a
dissenter
and
when
i
was
going
home
from
the
engineer
i
was
ashamed
of
my
condition
above
all
i
was
afraid
of
being
carried
away
whether
i
was
walking
along
the
street
or
working
or
talking
to
the
other
fellows
i
was
all
the
time
thinking
of
one
thing
only
of
going
in
the
evening
to
see
mariya
viktorovna
and
was
picturing
her
voice
her
laugh
her
movements
when
i
was
getting
ready
to
go
to
her
i
always
spent
a
long
time
before
my
nurse
warped
as
i
fastened
my
tie
my
serge
trousers
were
detestable
in
my
eyes
and
i
suffered
torments
and
at
the
same
time
despised
myself
for
being
so
trivial
when
she
called
to
me
out
of
the
other
room
that
she
was
not
dressed
and
asked
me
to
wait
i
listened
to
her
dressing
it
agitated
me
i
felt
as
though
the
ground
were
giving
way
under
my
feet
and
when
i
saw
a
woman
figure
in
the
street
even
at
a
distance
i
invariably
compared
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
our
girls
and
women
were
vulgar
that
they
were
absurdly
dressed
and
did
not
know
how
to
hold
themselves
and
these
comparisons
aroused
a
feeling
of
pride
in
me
mariya
viktorovna
was
the
best
of
them
all
and
i
dreamed
of
her
and
myself
at
night
one
evening
at
supper
with
the
engineer
we
ate
a
whole
lobster
as
i
was
going
home
afterwards
i
remembered
that
the
engineer
twice
called
me
my
dear
fellow
at
supper
and
i
reflected
that
they
treated
me
very
kindly
in
that
house
as
they
might
an
unfortunate
big
dog
who
had
been
kicked
out
by
its
owners
that
they
were
amusing
themselves
with
me
and
that
when
they
were
tired
of
me
they
would
turn
me
out
like
a
dog
i
felt
ashamed
and
wounded
wounded
to
the
point
of
tears
as
though
i
had
been
insulted
and
looking
up
at
the
sky
i
took
a
vow
to
put
an
end
to
all
this
the
next
day
i
did
not
go
to
the
dolzhikov
late
in
the
evening
when
it
was
quite
dark
and
raining
i
walked
along
great
dvoryansky
street
looking
up
at
the
windows
everyone
was
asleep
at
the
azhogins
and
the
only
light
was
in
one
of
the
furthest
windows
it
was
madame
azhogin
in
her
own
room
sewing
by
the
light
of
three
candles
imagining
that
she
was
combating
superstition
our
house
was
in
darkness
but
at
the
dolzhikovs
on
the
contrary
the
windows
were
lighted
up
but
one
could
distinguish
nothing
through
the
flowers
and
the
curtains
i
kept
walking
up
and
down
the
street
the
cold
march
rain
drenched
me
through
i
heard
my
father
come
home
from
the
club
he
stood
knocking
at
the
gate
a
minute
later
a
light
appeared
at
the
window
and
i
saw
my
sister
who
was
hastening
down
with
a
lamp
while
with
the
other
hand
she
was
twisting
her
thick
hair
together
as
she
went
then
my
father
walked
about
the
talking
and
rubbing
his
hands
while
my
sister
sat
in
a
low
chair
thinking
and
not
listening
to
what
he
said
but
then
they
went
away
the
light
went
out
i
glanced
round
at
the
engineer
and
there
too
all
was
darkness
now
in
the
dark
and
the
rain
i
felt
hopelessly
alone
abandoned
to
the
whims
of
destiny
i
felt
that
all
my
doings
my
desires
and
everything
i
had
thought
and
said
till
then
were
trivial
in
comparison
with
my
loneliness
in
comparison
with
my
present
suffering
and
the
suffering
that
lay
before
me
in
the
future
alas
the
thoughts
and
doings
of
living
creatures
are
not
nearly
so
significant
as
their
sufferings
and
without
clearly
realizing
what
i
was
doing
i
pulled
at
the
bell
of
the
dolzhikovs
gate
broke
it
and
ran
along
the
street
like
some
naughty
boy
with
a
feeling
of
terror
in
my
heart
expecting
every
moment
that
they
would
come
out
and
recognize
me
when
i
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
street
to
take
breath
i
could
hear
nothing
but
the
sound
of
the
rain
and
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
watchman
striking
on
a
sheet
of
iron
for
a
whole
week
i
did
not
go
to
the
dolzhikovs
my
serge
trousers
were
sold
there
was
nothing
doing
in
the
painting
trade
i
knew
the
pangs
of
hunger
again
and
earned
from
twopence
to
fourpence
a
day
where
i
could
by
heavy
and
unpleasant
work
struggling
up
to
my
knees
in
the
cold
mud
straining
my
chest
i
tried
to
stifle
my
memories
and
as
it
were
to
punish
myself
for
the
cheeses
and
preserves
with
which
i
had
been
regaled
at
the
engineer
but
all
the
same
as
soon
as
i
lay
in
bed
wet
and
hungry
my
sinful
imagination
immediately
began
to
paint
exquisite
seductive
pictures
and
with
amazement
i
acknowledged
to
myself
that
i
was
in
love
passionately
in
love
and
i
fell
into
a
sound
heavy
sleep
feeling
that
hard
labour
only
made
my
body
stronger
and
younger
one
evening
snow
began
falling
most
inappropriately
and
the
wind
blew
from
the
north
as
though
winter
had
come
back
again
when
i
returned
from
work
that
evening
i
found
mariya
viktorovna
in
my
room
she
was
sitting
in
her
fur
coat
and
had
both
hands
in
her
muff
why
do
you
come
to
see
me
she
asked
raising
her
clear
clever
eyes
and
i
was
utterly
confused
with
delight
and
stood
stiffly
upright
before
her
as
i
used
to
stand
facing
my
father
when
he
was
going
to
beat
me
she
looked
into
my
face
and
i
could
see
from
her
eyes
that
she
understood
why
i
was
confused
why
do
you
come
to
see
me
she
repeated
if
you
do
want
to
come
you
see
i
have
come
to
you
she
got
up
and
came
close
to
me
do
desert
me
she
said
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
am
alone
utterly
alone
she
began
crying
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
muff
articulated
alone
my
life
is
hard
very
hard
and
in
all
the
world
i
have
no
one
but
you
do
desert
me
looking
for
a
handkerchief
to
wipe
her
tears
she
smiled
we
were
silent
for
some
time
then
i
put
my
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
scratching
my
cheek
till
it
bled
with
her
hatpin
as
i
did
it
and
we
began
talking
to
each
other
as
though
we
had
been
on
the
closest
terms
for
ages
and
ages
x
two
days
later
she
sent
me
to
dubetchnya
and
i
was
unutterably
delighted
to
go
as
i
walked
towards
the
station
and
afterwards
as
i
was
sitting
in
the
train
i
kept
laughing
from
no
apparent
cause
and
people
looked
at
me
as
though
i
were
drunk
snow
was
falling
and
there
were
still
frosts
in
the
mornings
but
the
roads
were
already
and
rooks
hovered
over
them
cawing
at
first
i
had
intended
to
fit
up
an
abode
for
us
two
masha
and
me
in
the
lodge
at
the
side
opposite
madame
tcheprakov
lodge
but
it
appeared
that
the
doves
and
the
ducks
had
been
living
there
for
a
long
time
and
it
was
impossible
to
clean
it
without
destroying
a
great
number
of
nests
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
live
in
the
comfortless
rooms
of
the
big
house
with
the
sunblinds
the
peasants
called
the
house
the
palace
there
were
more
than
twenty
rooms
in
it
and
the
only
furniture
was
a
piano
and
a
lying
in
the
attic
and
if
masha
had
brought
all
her
furniture
from
the
town
we
should
even
then
have
been
unable
to
get
rid
of
the
impression
of
immense
emptiness
and
cold
i
picked
out
three
small
rooms
with
windows
looking
into
the
garden
and
worked
from
early
morning
till
night
setting
them
to
rights
putting
in
new
panes
papering
the
walls
filling
up
the
holes
and
chinks
in
the
floors
it
was
easy
pleasant
work
i
was
continually
running
to
the
river
to
see
whether
the
ice
were
not
going
i
kept
fancying
that
starlings
were
flying
and
at
night
thinking
of
masha
i
listened
with
an
unutterably
sweet
feeling
with
clutching
delight
to
the
noise
of
the
rats
and
the
wind
droning
and
knocking
above
the
ceiling
it
seemed
as
though
some
old
house
spirit
were
coughing
in
the
attic
the
snow
was
deep
a
great
deal
had
fallen
even
at
the
end
of
march
but
it
melted
quickly
as
though
by
magic
and
the
spring
floods
passed
in
a
tumultuous
rush
so
that
by
the
beginning
of
april
the
starlings
were
already
noisy
and
yellow
butterflies
were
flying
in
the
garden
it
was
exquisite
weather
every
day
towards
evening
i
used
to
walk
to
the
town
to
meet
masha
and
what
a
delight
it
was
to
walk
with
bare
feet
along
the
gradually
drying
still
soft
road
i
used
to
sit
down
and
look
towards
the
town
not
venturing
to
go
near
it
the
sight
of
it
troubled
me
i
kept
wondering
how
the
people
i
knew
would
behave
to
me
when
they
heard
of
my
love
what
would
my
father
say
what
troubled
me
particularly
was
the
thought
that
my
life
was
more
complicated
and
that
i
had
completely
lost
all
power
to
set
it
right
and
that
like
a
balloon
it
was
bearing
me
away
god
knows
whither
i
no
longer
considered
the
problem
how
to
earn
my
daily
bread
how
to
live
but
thought
about
i
really
do
know
what
masha
used
to
come
in
a
carriage
i
used
to
get
in
with
her
and
we
drove
to
dubetchnya
feeling
and
free
or
after
waiting
till
the
sun
had
set
i
would
go
back
dissatisfied
and
dreary
wondering
why
masha
had
not
come
at
the
gate
or
in
the
garden
i
would
be
met
by
a
sweet
unexpected
apparition
it
was
she
it
would
turn
out
that
she
had
come
by
rail
and
had
walked
from
the
station
what
a
festival
it
was
in
a
simple
woollen
dress
with
a
kerchief
on
her
head
with
a
modest
sunshade
but
laced
in
slender
in
expensive
foreign
boots
it
was
a
talented
actress
playing
the
part
of
a
little
workgirl
we
looked
round
our
domain
and
decided
which
should
be
her
room
and
which
mine
where
we
would
have
our
avenue
our
kitchen
garden
our
beehives
we
already
had
hens
ducks
and
geese
which
we
loved
because
they
were
ours
we
had
all
ready
for
sowing
oats
clover
timothy
grass
buckwheat
and
vegetable
seeds
and
we
always
looked
at
all
these
stores
and
discussed
at
length
the
crop
we
might
get
and
everything
masha
said
to
me
seemed
extraordinarily
clever
and
fine
this
was
the
happiest
time
of
my
life
soon
after
thomas
week
we
were
married
at
our
parish
church
in
the
village
of
kurilovka
two
miles
from
dubetchnya
masha
wanted
everything
to
be
done
quietly
at
her
wish
our
best
men
were
peasant
lads
the
sacristan
sang
alone
and
we
came
back
from
the
church
in
a
small
jolting
chaise
which
she
drove
herself
our
only
guest
from
the
town
was
my
sister
kleopatra
to
whom
masha
sent
a
note
three
days
before
the
wedding
my
sister
came
in
a
white
dress
and
wore
gloves
during
the
wedding
she
cried
quietly
from
joy
and
tenderness
her
expression
was
motherly
and
infinitely
kind
she
was
intoxicated
with
our
happiness
and
smiled
as
though
she
were
absorbing
a
sweet
delirium
and
looking
at
her
during
our
wedding
i
realized
that
for
her
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
higher
than
love
earthly
love
and
that
she
was
dreaming
of
it
secretly
timidly
but
continually
and
passionately
she
embraced
and
kissed
masha
and
not
knowing
how
to
express
her
rapture
said
to
her
of
me
he
is
good
he
is
very
good
before
she
went
away
she
changed
into
her
ordinary
dress
and
drew
me
into
the
garden
to
talk
to
me
alone
father
is
very
much
hurt
she
said
that
you
have
written
nothing
to
him
you
ought
to
have
asked
for
his
blessing
but
in
reality
he
is
very
much
pleased
he
says
that
this
marriage
will
raise
you
in
the
eyes
of
all
society
and
that
under
the
influence
of
mariya
viktorovna
you
will
begin
to
take
a
more
serious
view
of
life
we
talk
of
nothing
but
you
in
the
evenings
now
and
yesterday
he
actually
used
the
expression
misail
that
pleased
me
it
seems
as
though
he
had
some
plan
in
his
mind
and
i
fancy
he
wants
to
set
you
an
example
of
magnanimity
and
be
the
first
to
speak
of
reconciliation
it
is
very
possible
he
may
come
here
to
see
you
in
a
day
or
two
she
hurriedly
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
me
several
times
and
said
well
god
be
with
you
be
happy
anyuta
blagovo
is
a
very
clever
girl
she
says
about
your
marriage
that
god
is
sending
you
a
fresh
ordeal
to
be
sure
married
life
does
not
bring
only
joy
but
suffering
too
that
bound
to
be
so
masha
and
i
walked
a
couple
of
miles
to
see
her
on
her
way
we
walked
back
slowly
and
in
silence
as
though
we
were
resting
masha
held
my
hand
my
heart
felt
light
and
i
had
no
inclination
to
talk
about
love
we
had
become
closer
and
more
akin
now
that
we
were
married
and
we
felt
that
nothing
now
could
separate
us
your
sister
is
a
nice
creature
said
masha
but
it
seems
as
though
she
had
been
tormented
for
years
your
father
must
be
a
terrible
man
i
began
telling
her
how
my
sister
and
i
had
been
brought
up
and
what
a
senseless
torture
our
childhood
had
really
been
when
she
heard
how
my
father
had
so
lately
beaten
me
she
shuddered
and
drew
closer
to
me
do
tell
me
any
more
she
said
it
horrible
now
she
never
left
me
we
lived
together
in
the
three
rooms
in
the
big
house
and
in
the
evenings
we
bolted
the
door
which
led
to
the
empty
part
of
the
house
as
though
someone
were
living
there
whom
we
did
not
know
and
were
afraid
of
i
got
up
early
at
dawn
and
immediately
set
to
work
of
some
sort
i
mended
the
carts
made
paths
in
the
garden
dug
the
flower
beds
painted
the
roof
of
the
house
when
the
time
came
to
sow
the
oats
i
tried
to
plough
the
ground
over
again
to
harrow
and
to
sow
and
i
did
it
all
conscientiously
keeping
up
with
our
labourer
i
was
worn
out
the
rain
and
the
cold
wind
made
my
face
and
feet
burn
for
hours
afterwards
i
dreamed
of
ploughed
land
at
night
but
field
labour
did
not
attract
me
i
did
not
understand
farming
and
i
did
not
care
for
it
it
was
perhaps
because
my
forefathers
had
not
been
tillers
of
the
soil
and
the
very
blood
that
flowed
in
my
veins
was
purely
of
the
city
i
loved
nature
tenderly
i
loved
the
fields
and
meadows
and
kitchen
gardens
but
the
peasant
who
turned
up
the
soil
with
his
plough
and
urged
on
his
pitiful
horse
wet
and
tattered
with
his
craning
neck
was
to
me
the
expression
of
coarse
savage
ugly
force
and
every
time
i
looked
at
his
uncouth
movements
i
involuntarily
began
thinking
of
the
legendary
life
of
the
remote
past
before
men
knew
the
use
of
fire
the
fierce
bull
that
ran
with
the
peasants
herd
and
the
horses
when
they
dashed
about
the
village
stamping
their
hoofs
moved
me
to
fear
and
everything
rather
big
strong
and
angry
whether
it
was
the
ram
with
its
horns
the
gander
or
the
seemed
to
me
the
expression
of
the
same
coarse
savage
force
this
mood
was
particularly
strong
in
me
in
bad
weather
when
heavy
clouds
were
hanging
over
the
black
ploughed
land
above
all
when
i
was
ploughing
or
sowing
and
two
or
three
people
stood
looking
how
i
was
doing
it
i
had
not
the
feeling
that
this
work
was
inevitable
and
obligatory
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
amusing
myself
i
preferred
doing
something
in
the
yard
and
there
was
nothing
i
liked
so
much
as
painting
the
roof
i
used
to
walk
through
the
garden
and
the
meadow
to
our
mill
it
was
let
to
a
peasant
of
kurilovka
called
stepan
a
handsome
dark
fellow
with
a
thick
black
beard
who
looked
very
strong
he
did
not
like
the
miller
work
and
looked
upon
it
as
dreary
and
unprofitable
and
only
lived
at
the
mill
in
order
not
to
live
at
home
he
was
a
and
was
always
surrounded
by
a
pleasant
smell
of
tar
and
leather
he
was
not
fond
of
talking
he
was
listless
and
sluggish
and
was
always
sitting
in
the
doorway
or
on
the
river
bank
humming
his
wife
and
both
languid
and
meek
used
sometimes
to
come
from
kurilovka
to
see
him
they
made
low
bows
to
him
and
addressed
him
formally
stepan
petrovitch
while
he
went
on
sitting
on
the
river
bank
softly
humming
without
responding
by
word
or
movement
to
their
bows
one
hour
and
then
a
second
would
pass
in
silence
his
and
wife
after
whispering
together
would
get
up
and
gaze
at
him
for
some
time
expecting
him
to
look
round
then
they
would
make
a
low
bow
and
in
sugary
chanting
voices
say
stepan
petrovitch
and
they
would
go
away
after
that
stepan
picking
up
the
parcel
they
had
left
containing
cracknels
or
a
shirt
would
heave
a
sigh
and
say
winking
in
their
direction
the
female
sex
the
mill
with
two
sets
of
millstones
worked
day
and
night
i
used
to
help
stepan
i
liked
the
work
and
when
he
went
off
i
was
glad
to
stay
and
take
his
place
xi
after
bright
warm
weather
came
a
spell
of
wet
all
may
it
rained
and
was
cold
the
sound
of
the
millwheels
and
of
the
rain
disposed
one
to
indolence
and
slumber
the
floor
trembled
there
was
a
smell
of
flour
and
that
too
induced
drowsiness
my
wife
in
a
short
jacket
and
in
men
high
golosh
boots
would
make
her
appearance
twice
a
day
and
she
always
said
the
same
thing
and
this
is
called
summer
worse
than
it
was
in
october
we
used
to
have
tea
and
make
the
porridge
together
or
we
would
sit
for
hours
at
a
stretch
without
speaking
waiting
for
the
rain
to
stop
once
when
stepan
had
gone
off
to
the
fair
masha
stayed
all
night
at
the
mill
when
we
got
up
we
could
not
tell
what
time
it
was
as
the
rainclouds
covered
the
whole
sky
but
sleepy
cocks
were
crowing
at
dubetchnya
and
landrails
were
calling
in
the
meadows
it
was
still
very
very
early
my
wife
and
i
went
down
to
the
millpond
and
drew
out
the
net
which
stepan
had
thrown
in
over
night
in
our
presence
a
big
pike
was
struggling
in
it
and
a
was
twisting
about
clawing
upwards
with
its
pincers
let
them
go
said
masha
let
them
be
happy
too
because
we
got
up
so
early
and
afterwards
did
nothing
that
day
seemed
very
long
the
longest
day
in
my
life
towards
evening
stepan
came
back
and
i
went
home
your
father
came
said
masha
where
is
he
i
asked
he
has
gone
away
i
would
not
see
him
seeing
that
i
remained
standing
and
silent
that
i
was
sorry
for
my
father
she
said
one
must
be
consistent
i
would
not
see
him
and
sent
word
to
him
not
to
trouble
to
come
and
see
us
again
a
minute
later
i
was
out
at
the
gate
and
walking
to
the
town
to
explain
things
to
my
father
it
was
muddy
slippery
cold
for
the
first
time
since
my
marriage
i
felt
suddenly
sad
and
in
my
brain
exhausted
by
that
long
grey
day
there
was
stirring
the
thought
that
perhaps
i
was
not
living
as
i
ought
i
was
worn
out
little
by
little
i
was
overcome
by
despondency
and
indolence
i
did
not
want
to
move
or
think
and
after
going
on
a
little
i
gave
it
up
with
a
wave
of
my
hand
and
turned
back
the
engineer
in
a
leather
overcoat
with
a
hood
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
where
the
furniture
there
used
to
be
lovely
furniture
in
the
empire
style
there
used
to
be
pictures
there
used
to
be
vases
while
now
you
could
play
ball
in
it
i
bought
the
place
with
the
furniture
the
devil
take
her
moisey
a
thin
fellow
of
with
insolent
little
eyes
who
was
in
the
service
of
the
general
widow
stood
near
him
crumpling
up
his
cap
in
his
hands
one
of
his
cheeks
was
bigger
than
the
other
as
though
he
had
lain
too
long
on
it
your
honour
was
graciously
pleased
to
buy
the
place
without
the
furniture
he
brought
out
irresolutely
i
remember
hold
your
tongue
shouted
the
engineer
he
turned
crimson
and
shook
with
anger
and
the
echo
in
the
garden
loudly
repeated
his
shout
xii
when
i
was
doing
anything
in
the
garden
or
the
yard
moisey
would
stand
beside
me
and
folding
his
arms
behind
his
back
he
would
stand
lazily
and
impudently
staring
at
me
with
his
little
eyes
and
this
irritated
me
to
such
a
degree
that
i
threw
up
my
work
and
went
away
from
stepan
we
heard
that
moisey
was
madame
tcheprakov
lover
i
noticed
that
when
people
came
to
her
to
borrow
money
they
addressed
themselves
first
to
moisey
and
once
i
saw
a
peasant
black
from
head
to
foot
he
must
have
been
a
coalheaver
bow
down
at
moisey
feet
sometimes
after
a
little
whispering
he
gave
out
money
himself
without
consulting
his
mistress
from
which
i
concluded
that
he
did
a
little
business
on
his
own
account
he
used
to
shoot
in
our
garden
under
our
windows
carried
off
victuals
from
our
cellar
borrowed
our
horses
without
asking
permission
and
we
were
indignant
and
began
to
feel
as
though
dubetchnya
were
not
ours
and
masha
would
say
turning
pale
can
we
really
have
to
go
on
living
with
these
reptiles
another
eighteen
months
madame
tcheprakov
son
ivan
was
serving
as
a
guard
on
our
he
had
grown
much
thinner
and
feebler
during
the
winter
so
that
a
single
glass
was
enough
to
make
him
drunk
and
he
shivered
out
of
the
sunshine
he
wore
the
guard
uniform
with
aversion
and
was
ashamed
of
it
but
considered
his
post
a
good
one
as
he
could
steal
the
candles
and
sell
them
my
new
position
excited
in
him
a
mixed
feeling
of
wonder
envy
and
a
vague
hope
that
something
of
the
same
sort
might
happen
to
him
he
used
to
watch
masha
with
ecstatic
eyes
ask
me
what
i
had
for
dinner
now
and
his
lean
and
ugly
face
wore
a
sad
and
sweetish
expression
and
he
moved
his
fingers
as
though
he
were
feeling
my
happiness
with
them
listen
he
said
fussily
relighting
his
cigarette
at
every
instant
there
was
always
a
litter
where
he
stood
for
he
wasted
dozens
of
matches
lighting
one
cigarette
listen
my
life
now
is
the
nastiest
possible
the
worst
of
it
is
any
subaltern
can
shout
there
guard
i
have
overheard
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
train
my
boy
and
do
you
know
i
have
learned
that
life
a
beastly
thing
my
mother
has
been
the
ruin
of
me
a
doctor
in
the
train
told
me
that
if
parents
are
immoral
their
children
are
drunkards
or
criminals
think
of
that
once
he
came
into
the
yard
staggering
his
eyes
gazed
about
blankly
his
breathing
was
laboured
he
laughed
and
cried
and
babbled
as
though
in
a
high
fever
and
the
only
words
i
could
catch
in
his
muddled
talk
were
my
mother
where
my
mother
which
he
uttered
with
a
wail
like
a
child
who
has
lost
his
mother
in
a
crowd
i
led
him
into
our
garden
and
laid
him
down
under
a
tree
and
masha
and
i
took
turns
to
sit
by
him
all
that
day
and
all
night
he
was
very
sick
and
masha
looked
with
aversion
at
his
pale
wet
face
and
said
is
it
possible
these
reptiles
will
go
on
living
another
year
and
a
half
in
our
yard
it
awful
it
awful
and
how
many
mortifications
the
peasants
caused
us
how
many
bitter
disappointments
in
those
early
days
in
the
spring
months
when
we
so
longed
to
be
happy
my
wife
built
a
school
i
drew
a
plan
of
a
school
for
sixty
boys
and
the
zemstvo
board
approved
of
it
but
advised
us
to
build
the
school
at
kurilovka
the
big
village
which
was
only
two
miles
from
us
moreover
the
school
at
kurilovka
in
which
children
from
four
villages
our
dubetchnya
being
one
of
the
number
were
taught
was
old
and
too
small
and
the
floor
was
scarcely
safe
to
walk
upon
at
the
end
of
march
at
masha
wish
she
was
appointed
guardian
of
the
kurilovka
school
and
at
the
beginning
of
april
we
three
times
summoned
the
village
assembly
and
tried
to
persuade
the
peasants
that
their
school
was
old
and
overcrowded
and
that
it
was
essential
to
build
a
new
one
a
member
of
the
zemstvo
board
and
the
inspector
of
peasant
schools
came
and
they
too
tried
to
persuade
them
after
each
meeting
the
peasants
surrounded
us
begging
for
a
bucket
of
vodka
we
were
hot
in
the
crowd
we
were
soon
exhausted
and
returned
home
dissatisfied
and
a
little
ill
at
ease
in
the
end
the
peasants
set
apart
a
plot
of
ground
for
the
school
and
were
obliged
to
bring
all
the
building
material
from
the
town
with
their
own
horses
and
the
very
first
sunday
after
the
spring
corn
was
sown
carts
set
off
from
kurilovka
and
dubetchnya
to
fetch
bricks
for
the
foundations
they
set
off
as
soon
as
it
was
light
and
came
back
late
in
the
evening
the
peasants
were
drunk
and
said
they
were
worn
out
as
would
have
it
the
rain
and
the
cold
persisted
all
through
may
the
road
was
in
an
awful
state
it
was
deep
in
mud
the
carts
usually
drove
into
our
yard
when
they
came
back
from
the
town
and
what
a
horrible
ordeal
it
was
a
potbellied
horse
would
appear
at
the
gate
setting
its
front
legs
wide
apart
it
would
stumble
forward
before
coming
into
the
yard
a
beam
nine
yards
long
wet
and
crept
in
on
a
waggon
beside
it
muffled
up
against
the
rain
strode
a
peasant
with
the
skirts
of
his
coat
tucked
up
in
his
belt
not
looking
where
he
was
going
but
stepping
through
the
puddles
another
cart
would
appear
with
boards
then
a
third
with
a
beam
a
fourth
and
the
space
before
our
house
was
gradually
crowded
up
with
horses
beams
and
planks
men
and
women
with
their
heads
muffled
and
their
skirts
tucked
up
would
stare
angrily
at
our
windows
make
an
uproar
and
clamour
for
the
mistress
to
come
out
to
them
coarse
oaths
were
audible
meanwhile
moisey
stood
at
one
side
and
we
fancied
he
was
enjoying
our
discomfiture
we
are
not
going
to
cart
any
more
the
peasants
would
shout
we
are
worn
out
let
her
go
and
get
the
stuff
herself
masha
pale
and
flustered
expecting
every
minute
that
they
would
break
into
the
house
would
send
them
out
a
of
vodka
after
that
the
noise
would
subside
and
the
long
beams
one
after
another
would
crawl
slowly
out
of
the
yard
when
i
was
setting
off
to
see
the
building
my
wife
was
worried
and
said
the
peasants
are
spiteful
i
only
hope
they
wo
do
you
a
mischief
wait
a
minute
i
come
with
you
we
drove
to
kurilovka
together
and
there
the
carpenters
asked
us
for
a
drink
the
framework
of
the
house
was
ready
it
was
time
to
lay
the
foundation
but
the
masons
had
not
come
this
caused
delay
and
the
carpenters
complained
and
when
at
last
the
masons
did
come
it
appeared
that
there
was
no
sand
it
had
been
somehow
overlooked
that
it
would
be
needed
taking
advantage
of
our
helpless
position
the
peasants
demanded
thirty
kopecks
for
each
cartload
though
the
distance
from
the
building
to
the
river
where
they
got
the
sand
was
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
more
than
five
hundred
cartloads
were
found
to
be
necessary
there
was
no
end
to
the
misunderstandings
swearing
and
importunity
my
wife
was
indignant
and
the
foreman
of
the
masons
tit
petrov
an
old
man
of
seventy
took
her
by
the
arm
and
said
you
look
here
you
look
here
you
only
bring
me
the
sand
i
set
ten
men
on
at
once
and
in
two
days
it
will
be
done
you
look
here
but
they
brought
the
sand
and
two
days
passed
and
four
and
a
week
and
instead
of
the
promised
foundations
there
was
still
a
yawning
hole
it
enough
to
drive
one
out
of
one
senses
said
my
wife
in
distress
what
people
what
people
in
the
midst
of
these
disorderly
doings
the
engineer
arrived
he
brought
with
him
parcels
of
wine
and
savouries
and
after
a
prolonged
meal
lay
down
for
a
nap
in
the
verandah
and
snored
so
loudly
that
the
labourers
shook
their
heads
and
said
well
masha
was
not
pleased
at
his
coming
she
did
not
trust
him
though
at
the
same
time
she
asked
his
advice
when
after
sleeping
too
long
after
dinner
he
got
up
in
a
bad
humour
and
said
unpleasant
things
about
our
management
of
the
place
or
expressed
regret
that
he
had
bought
dubetchnya
which
had
already
been
a
loss
to
him
poor
masha
face
wore
an
expression
of
misery
she
would
complain
to
him
and
he
would
yawn
and
say
that
the
peasants
ought
to
be
flogged
he
called
our
marriage
and
our
life
a
farce
and
said
it
was
a
caprice
a
whim
she
has
done
something
of
the
sort
before
he
said
about
masha
she
once
fancied
herself
a
great
opera
singer
and
left
me
i
was
looking
for
her
for
two
months
and
my
dear
soul
i
spent
a
thousand
roubles
on
telegrams
alone
he
no
longer
called
me
a
dissenter
or
painter
and
did
not
as
in
the
past
express
approval
of
my
living
like
a
workman
but
said
you
are
a
strange
person
you
are
not
a
normal
person
i
venture
to
prophesy
but
you
will
come
to
a
bad
end
and
masha
slept
badly
at
night
and
was
always
sitting
at
our
bedroom
window
thinking
there
was
no
laughter
at
supper
now
no
charming
grimaces
i
was
wretched
and
when
it
rained
every
drop
that
fell
seemed
to
pierce
my
heart
like
small
shot
and
i
felt
ready
to
fall
on
my
knees
before
masha
and
apologize
for
the
weather
when
the
peasants
made
a
noise
in
the
yard
i
felt
guilty
also
for
hours
at
a
time
i
sat
still
in
one
place
thinking
of
nothing
but
what
a
splendid
person
masha
was
what
a
wonderful
person
i
loved
her
passionately
and
i
was
fascinated
by
everything
she
did
everything
she
said
she
had
a
bent
for
quiet
studious
pursuits
she
was
fond
of
reading
for
hours
together
of
studying
although
her
knowledge
of
farming
was
only
from
books
she
surprised
us
all
by
what
she
knew
and
every
piece
of
advice
she
gave
was
of
value
not
one
was
ever
thrown
away
and
with
all
that
what
nobility
what
taste
what
graciousness
that
graciousness
which
is
only
found
in
people
to
this
woman
with
her
sound
practical
intelligence
the
disorderly
surroundings
with
petty
cares
and
sordid
anxieties
in
which
we
were
living
now
were
an
agony
i
saw
that
and
could
not
sleep
at
night
my
brain
worked
feverishly
and
i
had
a
lump
in
my
throat
i
rushed
about
not
knowing
what
to
do
i
galloped
to
the
town
and
brought
masha
books
newspapers
sweets
flowers
with
stepan
i
caught
fish
wading
for
hours
up
to
my
neck
in
the
cold
water
in
the
rain
to
catch
to
vary
our
fare
i
demeaned
myself
to
beg
the
peasants
not
to
make
a
noise
i
plied
them
with
vodka
bought
them
off
made
all
sorts
of
promises
and
how
many
other
foolish
things
i
did
at
last
the
rain
ceased
the
earth
dried
one
would
get
up
at
four
in
the
morning
one
would
go
out
into
the
garden
where
there
was
dew
sparkling
on
the
flowers
the
twitter
of
birds
the
hum
of
insects
not
one
cloud
in
the
sky
and
the
garden
the
meadows
and
the
river
were
so
lovely
yet
there
were
memories
of
the
peasants
of
their
carts
of
the
engineer
masha
and
i
drove
out
together
in
the
racing
droshky
to
the
fields
to
look
at
the
oats
she
used
to
drive
i
sat
behind
her
shoulders
were
raised
and
the
wind
played
with
her
hair
keep
to
the
right
she
shouted
to
those
she
met
you
are
like
a
i
said
to
her
one
day
maybe
why
my
grandfather
the
engineer
father
was
a
did
you
know
that
she
asked
turning
to
me
and
at
once
she
mimicked
the
way
shout
and
sing
and
thank
god
for
that
i
thought
as
i
listened
to
her
thank
god
and
again
memories
of
the
peasants
of
the
carts
of
the
engineer
xiii
blagovo
arrived
on
his
bicycle
my
sister
began
coming
often
again
there
were
conversations
about
manual
labour
about
progress
about
a
mysterious
millennium
awaiting
mankind
in
the
remote
future
the
doctor
did
not
like
our
farmwork
because
it
interfered
with
arguments
and
said
that
ploughing
reaping
grazing
calves
were
unworthy
of
a
free
man
and
all
these
coarse
forms
of
the
struggle
for
existence
men
would
in
time
relegate
to
animals
and
machines
while
they
would
devote
themselves
exclusively
to
scientific
investigation
my
sister
kept
begging
them
to
let
her
go
home
earlier
and
if
she
stayed
on
till
late
in
the
evening
or
spent
the
night
with
us
there
would
be
no
end
to
the
agitation
good
heavens
what
a
baby
you
are
still
said
masha
reproachfully
it
is
positively
absurd
yes
it
is
absurd
my
sister
agreed
i
know
it
absurd
but
what
is
to
be
done
if
i
have
the
strength
to
get
over
it
i
keep
feeling
as
though
i
were
doing
wrong
at
haymaking
i
ached
all
over
from
the
unaccustomed
labour
in
the
evening
sitting
on
the
verandah
and
talking
with
the
others
i
suddenly
dropped
asleep
and
they
laughed
aloud
at
me
they
waked
me
up
and
made
me
sit
down
to
supper
i
was
overpowered
with
drowsiness
and
i
saw
the
lights
the
faces
and
the
plates
as
it
were
in
a
dream
heard
the
voices
but
did
not
understand
them
and
getting
up
early
in
the
morning
i
took
up
the
scythe
at
once
or
went
to
the
building
and
worked
hard
all
day
when
i
remained
at
home
on
holidays
i
noticed
that
my
sister
and
masha
were
concealing
something
from
me
and
even
seemed
to
be
avoiding
me
my
wife
was
tender
to
me
as
before
but
she
had
thoughts
of
her
own
apart
which
she
did
not
share
with
me
there
was
no
doubt
that
her
exasperation
with
the
peasants
was
growing
the
life
was
becoming
more
and
more
distasteful
to
her
and
yet
she
did
not
complain
to
me
she
talked
to
the
doctor
now
more
readily
than
she
did
to
me
and
i
did
not
understand
why
it
was
so
it
was
the
custom
in
our
province
at
haymaking
and
harvest
time
for
the
labourers
to
come
to
the
manor
house
in
the
evening
and
be
regaled
with
vodka
even
young
girls
drank
a
glass
we
did
not
keep
up
this
practice
the
mowers
and
the
peasant
women
stood
about
in
our
yard
till
late
in
the
evening
expecting
vodka
and
then
departed
abusing
us
and
all
the
time
masha
frowned
grimly
and
said
nothing
or
murmured
to
the
doctor
with
exasperation
savages
petchenyegs
in
the
country
newcomers
are
met
ungraciously
almost
with
hostility
as
they
are
at
school
and
we
were
received
in
this
way
at
first
we
were
looked
upon
as
stupid
silly
people
who
had
bought
an
estate
simply
because
we
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
our
money
we
were
laughed
at
the
peasants
grazed
their
cattle
in
our
wood
and
even
in
our
garden
they
drove
away
our
cows
and
horses
to
the
village
and
then
demanded
money
for
the
damage
done
by
them
they
came
in
whole
companies
into
our
yard
and
loudly
clamoured
that
at
the
mowing
we
had
cut
some
piece
of
land
that
did
not
belong
to
us
and
as
we
did
not
yet
know
the
boundaries
of
our
estate
very
accurately
we
took
their
word
for
it
and
paid
damages
afterwards
it
turned
out
that
there
had
been
no
mistake
at
the
mowing
they
barked
the
in
our
wood
one
of
the
dubetchnya
peasants
a
regular
shark
who
did
a
trade
in
vodka
without
a
licence
bribed
our
labourers
and
in
collaboration
with
them
cheated
us
in
a
most
treacherous
way
they
took
the
new
wheels
off
our
carts
and
replaced
them
with
old
ones
stole
our
ploughing
harness
and
actually
sold
them
to
us
and
so
on
but
what
was
most
mortifying
of
all
was
what
happened
at
the
building
the
peasant
women
stole
by
night
boards
bricks
tiles
pieces
of
iron
the
village
elder
with
witnesses
made
a
search
in
their
huts
the
village
meeting
fined
them
two
roubles
each
and
afterwards
this
money
was
spent
on
drink
by
the
whole
commune
when
masha
heard
about
this
she
would
say
to
the
doctor
or
my
sister
indignantly
what
beasts
it
awful
awful
and
i
heard
her
more
than
once
express
regret
that
she
had
ever
taken
it
into
her
head
to
build
the
school
you
must
understand
the
doctor
tried
to
persuade
her
that
if
you
build
this
school
and
do
good
in
general
it
not
for
the
sake
of
the
peasants
but
in
the
name
of
culture
in
the
name
of
the
future
and
the
worse
the
peasants
are
the
more
reason
for
building
the
school
understand
that
but
there
was
a
lack
of
conviction
in
his
voice
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
both
he
and
masha
hated
the
peasants
masha
often
went
to
the
mill
taking
my
sister
with
her
and
they
both
said
laughing
that
they
went
to
have
a
look
at
stepan
he
was
so
handsome
stepan
it
appeared
was
torpid
and
taciturn
only
with
men
in
feminine
society
his
manners
were
free
and
easy
and
he
talked
incessantly
one
day
going
down
to
the
river
to
bathe
i
accidentally
overheard
a
conversation
masha
and
kleopatra
both
in
white
dresses
were
sitting
on
the
bank
in
the
spreading
shade
of
a
willow
and
stepan
was
standing
by
them
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
was
saying
are
peasants
men
they
are
not
men
but
asking
your
pardon
wild
beasts
impostors
what
life
has
a
peasant
nothing
but
eating
and
drinking
all
he
cares
for
is
victuals
to
be
cheaper
and
swilling
liquor
at
the
tavern
like
a
fool
and
there
no
conversation
no
manners
no
formality
nothing
but
ignorance
he
lives
in
filth
his
wife
lives
in
filth
and
his
children
live
in
filth
what
he
stands
up
in
he
lies
down
to
sleep
in
he
picks
the
potatoes
out
of
the
soup
with
his
fingers
he
drinks
kvass
with
a
cockroach
in
it
and
does
bother
to
blow
it
away
it
their
poverty
of
course
my
sister
put
in
poverty
there
is
want
to
be
sure
there
different
sorts
of
want
madam
if
a
man
is
in
prison
or
let
us
say
blind
or
crippled
that
really
is
trouble
i
would
wish
anyone
but
if
a
man
free
and
has
all
his
senses
if
he
has
his
eyes
and
his
hands
and
his
strength
and
god
what
more
does
he
want
it
cockering
themselves
and
it
ignorance
madam
it
not
poverty
if
you
let
us
suppose
good
gentlefolk
by
your
education
wish
out
of
kindness
to
help
him
he
will
drink
away
your
money
in
his
low
way
or
what
worse
he
will
open
a
drinkshop
and
with
your
money
start
robbing
the
people
you
say
poverty
but
does
the
rich
peasant
live
better
he
too
asking
your
pardon
lives
like
a
swine
coarse
broader
than
he
is
long
fat
mug
like
to
swing
my
fist
and
send
him
flying
the
scoundrel
larion
another
rich
one
at
dubetchnya
and
i
bet
he
strips
the
bark
off
your
trees
as
much
as
any
poor
one
and
he
is
a
fellow
his
children
are
the
same
and
when
he
has
had
a
drop
too
much
he
topple
with
his
nose
in
a
puddle
and
sleep
there
they
are
all
a
worthless
lot
madam
if
you
live
in
a
village
with
them
it
is
like
hell
it
has
stuck
in
my
teeth
that
village
has
and
thank
the
lord
the
king
of
heaven
i
plenty
to
eat
and
clothes
to
wear
i
served
out
my
time
in
the
dragoons
i
was
village
elder
for
three
years
and
now
i
am
a
free
cossack
i
live
where
i
like
i
do
want
to
live
in
the
village
and
no
one
has
the
right
to
force
me
they
say
my
wife
they
say
you
are
bound
to
live
in
your
cottage
with
your
wife
but
why
so
i
am
not
her
hired
man
tell
me
stepan
did
you
marry
for
love
asked
masha
love
among
us
in
the
village
answered
stepan
and
he
gave
a
laugh
properly
speaking
madam
if
you
care
to
know
this
is
my
second
marriage
i
am
not
a
kurilovka
man
i
am
from
zalegoshtcho
but
afterwards
i
was
taken
into
kurilovka
when
i
married
you
see
my
father
did
not
want
to
divide
the
land
among
us
there
were
five
of
us
brothers
i
took
my
leave
and
went
to
another
village
to
live
with
my
wife
family
but
my
first
wife
died
when
she
was
young
what
did
she
die
of
of
foolishness
she
used
to
cry
and
cry
and
cry
for
no
reason
and
so
she
pined
away
she
was
always
drinking
some
sort
of
herbs
to
make
her
better
looking
and
i
suppose
she
damaged
her
inside
and
my
second
wife
is
a
kurilovka
woman
too
there
is
nothing
in
her
she
a
village
woman
a
peasant
woman
and
nothing
more
i
was
taken
in
when
they
plighted
me
to
her
i
thought
she
was
young
and
and
that
they
lived
in
a
clean
way
her
mother
was
just
like
a
flagellant
and
she
drank
coffee
and
the
chief
thing
to
be
sure
they
were
clean
in
their
ways
so
i
married
her
and
next
day
we
sat
down
to
dinner
i
bade
my
give
me
a
spoon
and
she
gives
me
a
spoon
and
i
see
her
wipe
it
out
with
her
finger
so
much
for
you
thought
i
nice
sort
of
cleanliness
yours
is
i
lived
a
year
with
them
and
then
i
went
away
i
might
have
married
a
girl
from
the
town
he
went
on
after
a
pause
they
say
a
wife
is
a
helpmate
to
her
husband
what
do
i
want
with
a
helpmate
i
help
myself
i
rather
she
talked
to
me
and
not
clack
clack
clack
but
circumstantially
feelingly
what
is
life
without
good
conversation
stepan
suddenly
paused
and
at
once
there
was
the
sound
of
his
dreary
monotonous
this
meant
that
he
had
seen
me
masha
used
often
to
go
to
the
mill
and
evidently
found
pleasure
in
her
conversations
with
stepan
stepan
abused
the
peasants
with
such
sincerity
and
conviction
and
she
was
attracted
to
him
every
time
she
came
back
from
the
mill
the
peasant
who
looked
after
the
garden
shouted
at
her
wench
palashka
hulla
wench
palashka
and
he
would
bark
like
a
dog
ga
ga
and
she
would
stop
and
look
at
him
attentively
as
though
in
that
idiot
barking
she
found
an
answer
to
her
thoughts
and
probably
he
attracted
her
in
the
same
way
as
stepan
abuse
at
home
some
piece
of
news
would
await
her
such
for
instance
as
that
the
geese
from
the
village
had
ruined
our
cabbage
in
the
garden
or
that
larion
had
stolen
the
reins
and
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
would
say
with
a
laugh
what
do
you
expect
of
these
people
she
was
indignant
and
there
was
rancour
in
her
heart
and
meanwhile
i
was
growing
used
to
the
peasants
and
i
felt
more
and
more
drawn
to
them
for
the
most
part
they
were
nervous
irritable
downtrodden
people
they
were
people
whose
imagination
had
been
stifled
ignorant
with
a
poor
dingy
outlook
on
life
whose
thoughts
were
ever
the
same
of
the
grey
earth
of
grey
days
of
black
bread
people
who
cheated
but
like
birds
hiding
nothing
but
their
head
behind
the
tree
people
who
could
not
count
they
would
not
come
to
mow
for
us
for
twenty
roubles
but
they
came
for
half
a
pail
of
vodka
though
for
twenty
roubles
they
could
have
bought
four
pails
there
really
was
filth
and
drunkenness
and
foolishness
and
deceit
but
with
all
that
one
yet
felt
that
the
life
of
the
peasants
rested
on
a
firm
sound
foundation
however
uncouth
a
wild
animal
the
peasant
following
the
plough
seemed
and
however
he
might
stupefy
himself
with
vodka
still
looking
at
him
more
closely
one
felt
that
there
was
in
him
what
was
needed
something
very
important
which
was
lacking
in
masha
and
in
the
doctor
for
instance
and
that
was
that
he
believed
the
chief
thing
on
earth
was
truth
and
justice
and
that
his
salvation
and
that
of
the
whole
people
was
only
to
be
found
in
truth
and
justice
and
so
more
than
anything
in
the
world
he
loved
just
dealing
i
told
my
wife
she
saw
the
spots
on
the
glass
but
not
the
glass
itself
she
said
nothing
in
reply
or
hummed
like
stepan
when
this
and
clever
woman
turned
pale
with
indignation
and
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
spoke
to
the
doctor
of
the
drunkenness
and
dishonesty
it
perplexed
me
and
i
was
struck
by
the
shortness
of
her
memory
how
could
she
forget
that
her
father
the
engineer
drank
too
and
drank
heavily
and
that
the
money
with
which
dubetchnya
had
been
bought
had
been
acquired
by
a
whole
series
of
shameless
impudent
dishonesties
how
could
she
forget
it
xiv
my
sister
too
was
leading
a
life
of
her
own
which
she
carefully
hid
from
me
she
was
often
whispering
with
masha
when
i
went
up
to
her
she
seemed
to
shrink
into
herself
and
there
was
a
guilty
imploring
look
in
her
eyes
evidently
there
was
something
going
on
in
her
heart
of
which
she
was
afraid
or
ashamed
so
as
to
avoid
meeting
me
in
the
garden
or
being
left
alone
with
me
she
always
kept
close
to
masha
and
i
rarely
had
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
her
except
at
dinner
one
evening
i
was
walking
quietly
through
the
garden
on
my
way
back
from
the
building
it
was
beginning
to
get
dark
without
noticing
me
or
hearing
my
step
my
sister
was
walking
near
a
spreading
old
absolutely
noiselessly
as
though
she
were
a
phantom
she
was
dressed
in
black
and
was
walking
rapidly
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
same
track
looking
at
the
ground
an
apple
fell
from
the
tree
she
started
at
the
sound
stood
still
and
pressed
her
hands
to
her
temples
at
that
moment
i
went
up
to
her
in
a
rush
of
tender
affection
which
suddenly
flooded
my
heart
with
tears
in
my
eyes
suddenly
remembering
my
mother
and
our
childhood
i
put
my
arm
round
her
shoulders
and
kissed
her
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
her
you
are
unhappy
i
have
seen
it
for
a
long
time
tell
me
what
wrong
i
am
frightened
she
said
trembling
what
is
it
i
insisted
for
god
sake
be
open
i
will
i
will
be
open
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
to
hide
it
from
you
is
so
hard
so
agonizing
misail
i
love
she
went
on
in
a
whisper
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
am
happy
but
why
am
i
so
frightened
there
was
the
sound
of
footsteps
between
the
trees
appeared
blagovo
in
his
silk
shirt
with
his
high
top
boots
evidently
they
had
arranged
to
meet
near
the
seeing
him
she
rushed
impulsively
towards
him
with
a
cry
of
pain
as
though
he
were
being
taken
from
her
vladimir
vladimir
she
clung
to
him
and
looked
greedily
into
his
face
and
only
then
i
noticed
how
pale
and
thin
she
had
become
of
late
it
was
particularly
noticeable
from
her
lace
collar
which
i
had
known
for
so
long
and
which
now
hung
more
loosely
than
ever
before
about
her
thin
long
neck
the
doctor
was
disconcerted
but
at
once
recovered
himself
and
stroking
her
hair
said
there
there
why
so
nervous
you
see
i
here
we
were
silent
looking
with
embarrassment
at
each
other
then
we
walked
on
the
three
of
us
together
and
i
heard
the
doctor
say
to
me
civilized
life
has
not
yet
begun
among
us
old
men
console
themselves
by
making
out
that
if
there
is
nothing
now
there
was
something
in
the
forties
or
the
sixties
that
the
old
you
and
i
are
young
our
brains
have
not
yet
been
touched
by
we
can
not
comfort
ourselves
with
such
illusions
the
beginning
of
russia
was
in
but
the
beginning
of
civilized
russia
has
not
come
yet
but
i
did
not
grasp
the
meaning
of
these
reflections
it
was
somehow
strange
i
could
not
believe
it
that
my
sister
was
in
love
that
she
was
walking
and
holding
the
arm
of
a
stranger
and
looking
tenderly
at
him
my
sister
this
nervous
frightened
crushed
fettered
creature
loved
a
man
who
was
married
and
had
children
i
felt
sorry
for
something
but
what
exactly
i
do
know
the
presence
of
the
doctor
was
for
some
reason
distasteful
to
me
now
and
i
could
not
imagine
what
would
come
of
this
love
of
theirs
xv
masha
and
i
drove
to
kurilovka
to
the
dedication
of
the
school
autumn
autumn
autumn
said
masha
softly
looking
away
summer
is
over
there
are
no
birds
and
nothing
is
green
but
the
willows
yes
summer
was
over
there
were
fine
warm
days
but
it
was
fresh
in
the
morning
and
the
shepherds
went
out
in
their
sheepskins
already
and
in
our
garden
the
dew
did
not
dry
off
the
asters
all
day
long
there
were
plaintive
sounds
all
the
time
and
one
could
not
make
out
whether
they
came
from
the
shutters
creaking
on
their
rusty
hinges
or
from
the
flying
cranes
and
one
heart
felt
light
and
one
was
eager
for
life
the
summer
is
over
said
masha
now
you
and
i
can
balance
our
accounts
we
have
done
a
lot
of
work
a
lot
of
thinking
we
are
the
better
for
it
all
honour
and
glory
to
us
we
have
succeeded
in
but
have
our
successes
had
any
perceptible
influence
on
the
life
around
us
have
they
brought
any
benefit
to
anyone
whatever
no
ignorance
physical
uncleanliness
drunkenness
an
appallingly
high
infant
mortality
everything
remains
as
it
was
and
no
one
is
the
better
for
your
having
ploughed
and
sown
and
my
having
wasted
money
and
read
books
obviously
we
have
been
working
only
for
ourselves
and
have
had
advanced
ideas
only
for
ourselves
such
reasonings
perplexed
me
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
we
have
been
sincere
from
beginning
to
end
said
i
and
if
anyone
is
sincere
he
is
right
who
disputes
it
we
were
right
but
we
have
succeeded
in
properly
accomplishing
what
we
were
right
in
to
begin
with
our
external
methods
themselves
are
they
mistaken
you
want
to
be
of
use
to
men
but
by
the
very
fact
of
your
buying
an
estate
from
the
very
start
you
cut
yourself
off
from
any
possibility
of
doing
anything
useful
for
them
then
if
you
work
dress
eat
like
a
peasant
you
sanctify
as
it
were
by
your
authority
their
heavy
clumsy
dress
their
horrible
huts
their
stupid
beards
on
the
other
hand
if
we
suppose
that
you
work
for
long
long
years
your
whole
life
that
in
the
end
some
practical
results
are
obtained
yet
what
are
they
your
results
what
can
they
do
against
such
elemental
forces
as
wholesale
ignorance
hunger
cold
degeneration
a
drop
in
the
ocean
other
methods
of
struggle
are
needed
strong
bold
rapid
if
one
really
wants
to
be
of
use
one
must
get
out
of
the
narrow
circle
of
ordinary
social
work
and
try
to
act
direct
upon
the
mass
what
is
wanted
first
of
all
is
a
loud
energetic
propaganda
why
is
it
that
art
music
for
instance
is
so
living
so
popular
and
in
reality
so
powerful
because
the
musician
or
the
singer
affects
thousands
at
once
precious
precious
art
she
went
on
looking
dreamily
at
the
sky
art
gives
us
wings
and
carries
us
far
far
away
anyone
who
is
sick
of
filth
of
petty
mercenary
interests
anyone
who
is
revolted
wounded
and
indignant
can
find
peace
and
satisfaction
only
in
the
beautiful
when
we
drove
into
kurilovka
the
weather
was
bright
and
joyous
somewhere
they
were
threshing
there
was
a
smell
of
rye
straw
a
mountain
ash
was
bright
red
behind
the
hurdle
fences
and
all
the
trees
wherever
one
looked
were
ruddy
or
golden
they
were
ringing
the
bells
they
were
carrying
the
ikons
to
the
school
and
we
could
hear
them
sing
holy
mother
our
defender
and
how
limpid
the
air
was
and
how
high
the
doves
were
flying
the
service
was
being
held
in
the
classroom
then
the
peasants
of
kurilovka
brought
masha
the
ikon
and
the
peasants
of
dubetchnya
offered
her
a
big
loaf
and
a
gilt
salt
cellar
and
masha
broke
into
sobs
if
anything
has
been
said
that
should
have
been
or
anything
done
not
to
your
liking
forgive
us
said
an
old
man
and
he
bowed
down
to
her
and
to
me
as
we
drove
home
masha
kept
looking
round
at
the
school
the
green
roof
which
i
had
painted
and
which
was
glistening
in
the
sun
remained
in
sight
for
a
long
while
and
i
felt
that
the
look
masha
turned
upon
it
now
was
one
of
farewell
xvi
in
the
evening
she
got
ready
to
go
to
the
town
of
late
she
had
taken
to
going
often
to
the
town
and
staying
the
night
there
in
her
absence
i
could
not
work
my
hands
felt
weak
and
limp
our
huge
courtyard
seemed
a
dreary
repulsive
empty
hole
the
garden
was
full
of
angry
noises
and
without
her
the
house
the
trees
the
horses
were
no
longer
ours
i
did
not
go
out
of
the
house
but
went
on
sitting
at
her
table
beside
her
bookshelf
with
the
books
on
land
work
those
old
favourites
no
longer
wanted
and
looking
at
me
now
so
shamefacedly
for
whole
hours
together
while
it
struck
seven
eight
nine
while
the
autumn
night
black
as
soot
came
on
outside
i
kept
examining
her
old
glove
or
the
pen
with
which
she
always
wrote
or
her
little
scissors
i
did
nothing
and
realized
clearly
that
all
i
had
done
before
ploughing
mowing
chopping
had
only
been
because
she
wished
it
and
if
she
had
sent
me
to
clean
a
deep
well
where
i
had
to
stand
up
to
my
waist
in
deep
water
i
should
have
crawled
into
the
well
without
considering
whether
it
was
necessary
or
not
and
now
when
she
was
not
near
dubetchnya
with
its
ruins
its
untidiness
its
banging
shutters
with
its
thieves
by
day
and
by
night
seemed
to
me
a
chaos
in
which
any
work
would
be
useless
besides
what
had
i
to
work
for
here
why
anxiety
and
thought
about
the
future
if
i
felt
that
the
earth
was
giving
way
under
my
feet
that
i
had
played
my
part
in
dubetchnya
and
that
the
fate
of
the
books
on
farming
was
awaiting
me
too
oh
what
misery
it
was
at
night
in
hours
of
solitude
when
i
was
listening
every
minute
in
alarm
as
though
i
were
expecting
someone
to
shout
that
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
away
i
did
not
grieve
for
dubetchnya
i
grieved
for
my
love
which
too
was
threatened
with
its
autumn
what
an
immense
happiness
it
is
to
love
and
be
loved
and
how
awful
to
feel
that
one
is
slipping
down
from
that
high
pinnacle
masha
returned
from
the
town
towards
the
evening
of
the
next
day
she
was
displeased
with
something
but
she
concealed
it
and
only
said
why
was
it
all
the
window
frames
had
been
put
in
for
the
winter
it
was
enough
to
suffocate
one
i
took
out
two
frames
we
were
not
hungry
but
we
sat
down
to
supper
go
and
wash
your
hands
said
my
wife
you
smell
of
putty
she
had
brought
some
new
illustrated
papers
from
the
town
and
we
looked
at
them
together
after
supper
there
were
supplements
with
fashion
plates
and
patterns
masha
looked
through
them
casually
and
was
putting
them
aside
to
examine
them
properly
later
on
but
one
dress
with
a
flat
skirt
as
full
as
a
bell
and
large
sleeves
interested
her
and
she
looked
at
it
for
a
minute
gravely
and
attentively
that
not
bad
she
said
yes
that
dress
would
suit
you
beautifully
i
said
beautifully
and
looking
with
emotion
at
the
dress
admiring
that
patch
of
grey
simply
because
she
liked
it
i
went
on
tenderly
a
charming
exquisite
dress
splendid
glorious
masha
my
precious
masha
and
tears
dropped
on
the
fashion
plate
splendid
masha
i
muttered
sweet
precious
masha
she
went
to
bed
while
i
sat
another
hour
looking
at
the
illustrations
it
a
pity
you
took
out
the
window
frames
she
said
from
the
bedroom
i
am
afraid
it
may
be
cold
oh
dear
what
a
draught
there
is
i
read
something
out
of
the
column
of
odds
and
ends
a
receipt
for
making
cheap
ink
and
an
account
of
the
biggest
diamond
in
the
world
i
came
again
upon
the
fashion
plate
of
the
dress
she
liked
and
i
imagined
her
at
a
ball
with
a
fan
bare
shoulders
brilliant
splendid
with
a
full
understanding
of
painting
music
literature
and
how
small
and
how
brief
my
part
seemed
our
meeting
our
marriage
had
been
only
one
of
the
episodes
of
which
there
would
be
many
more
in
the
life
of
this
vital
richly
gifted
woman
all
the
best
in
the
world
as
i
have
said
already
was
at
her
service
and
she
received
it
absolutely
for
nothing
and
even
ideas
and
the
intellectual
movement
in
vogue
served
simply
for
her
recreation
giving
variety
to
her
life
and
i
was
only
the
who
drove
her
from
one
entertainment
to
another
now
she
did
not
need
me
she
would
take
flight
and
i
should
be
alone
and
as
though
in
response
to
my
thought
there
came
a
despairing
scream
from
the
garden
it
was
a
shrill
womanish
voice
and
as
though
to
mimic
it
the
wind
whistled
in
the
chimney
on
the
same
shrill
note
half
a
minute
passed
and
again
through
the
noise
of
the
wind
but
coming
it
seemed
from
the
other
end
of
the
yard
misail
do
you
hear
my
wife
asked
me
softly
do
you
hear
she
came
out
from
the
bedroom
in
her
nightgown
with
her
hair
down
and
listened
looking
at
the
dark
window
someone
is
being
murdered
she
said
that
is
the
last
straw
i
took
my
gun
and
went
out
it
was
very
dark
outside
the
wind
was
high
and
it
was
difficult
to
stand
i
went
to
the
gate
and
listened
the
trees
roared
the
wind
whistled
and
probably
at
the
peasant
a
dog
howled
lazily
outside
the
gates
the
darkness
was
absolute
not
a
light
on
the
and
near
the
lodge
which
a
year
before
had
been
the
office
suddenly
sounded
a
smothered
scream
who
there
i
called
there
were
two
people
struggling
one
was
thrusting
the
other
out
while
the
other
was
resisting
and
both
were
breathing
heavily
leave
go
said
one
and
i
recognized
ivan
tcheprakov
it
was
he
who
was
shrieking
in
a
shrill
womanish
voice
let
go
you
damned
brute
or
i
bite
your
hand
off
the
other
i
recognized
as
moisey
i
separated
them
and
as
i
did
so
i
could
not
resist
hitting
moisey
two
blows
in
the
face
he
fell
down
then
got
up
again
and
i
hit
him
once
more
he
tried
to
kill
me
he
muttered
he
was
trying
to
get
at
his
mamma
chest
i
want
to
lock
him
up
in
the
lodge
for
security
tcheprakov
was
drunk
and
did
not
recognize
me
he
kept
drawing
deep
breaths
as
though
he
were
just
going
to
shout
help
again
i
left
them
and
went
back
to
the
house
my
wife
was
lying
on
her
bed
she
had
dressed
i
told
her
what
had
happened
in
the
yard
and
did
not
conceal
the
fact
that
i
had
hit
moisey
it
terrible
to
live
in
the
country
she
said
and
what
a
long
night
it
is
oh
dear
if
only
it
were
over
we
heard
again
a
little
later
i
go
and
stop
them
i
said
no
let
them
bite
each
other
throats
she
said
with
an
expression
of
disgust
she
was
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
listening
while
i
sat
beside
her
not
daring
to
speak
to
her
feeling
as
though
i
were
to
blame
for
their
shouting
help
in
the
yard
and
for
the
night
seeming
so
long
we
were
silent
and
i
waited
impatiently
for
a
gleam
of
light
at
the
window
and
masha
looked
all
the
time
as
though
she
had
awakened
from
a
trance
and
now
was
marvelling
how
she
so
clever
and
so
elegant
had
come
into
this
pitiful
provincial
empty
hole
among
a
crew
of
petty
insignificant
people
and
how
she
could
have
so
far
forgotten
herself
as
ever
to
be
attracted
by
one
of
these
people
and
for
more
than
six
months
to
have
been
his
wife
it
seemed
to
me
that
at
that
moment
it
did
not
matter
to
her
whether
it
was
i
or
moisey
or
tcheprakov
everything
for
her
was
merged
in
that
savage
drunken
help
i
and
our
marriage
and
our
work
together
and
the
mud
and
slush
of
autumn
and
when
she
sighed
or
moved
into
a
more
comfortable
position
i
read
in
her
face
oh
that
morning
would
come
quickly
in
the
morning
she
went
away
i
spent
another
three
days
at
dubetchnya
expecting
her
then
i
packed
all
our
things
in
one
room
locked
it
and
walked
to
the
town
it
was
already
evening
when
i
rang
at
the
engineer
and
the
street
lamps
were
burning
in
great
dvoryansky
street
pavel
told
me
there
was
no
one
at
home
viktor
ivanitch
had
gone
to
petersburg
and
mariya
viktorovna
was
probably
at
the
rehearsal
at
the
azhogins
i
remember
with
what
emotion
i
went
on
to
the
azhogins
how
my
heart
throbbed
and
fluttered
as
i
mounted
the
stairs
and
stood
waiting
a
long
while
on
the
landing
at
the
top
not
daring
to
enter
that
temple
of
the
muses
in
the
big
room
there
were
lighted
candles
everywhere
on
a
little
table
on
the
piano
and
on
the
stage
everywhere
in
threes
and
the
first
performance
was
fixed
for
the
thirteenth
and
now
the
first
rehearsal
was
on
a
monday
an
unlucky
day
all
part
of
the
war
against
superstition
all
the
devotees
of
the
scenic
art
were
gathered
together
the
eldest
the
middle
and
the
youngest
sisters
were
walking
about
the
stage
reading
their
parts
in
exercise
books
apart
from
all
the
rest
stood
radish
motionless
with
the
side
of
his
head
pressed
to
the
wall
as
he
gazed
with
adoration
at
the
stage
waiting
for
the
rehearsal
to
begin
everything
as
it
used
to
be
i
was
making
my
way
to
my
hostess
i
had
to
pay
my
respects
to
her
but
suddenly
everyone
said
hush
and
waved
me
to
step
quietly
there
was
a
silence
the
lid
of
the
piano
was
raised
a
lady
sat
down
at
it
screwing
up
her
eyes
at
the
music
and
my
masha
walked
up
to
the
piano
in
a
dress
looking
beautiful
but
with
a
special
new
sort
of
beauty
not
in
the
least
like
the
masha
who
used
to
come
and
meet
me
in
the
spring
at
the
mill
she
sang
why
do
i
love
the
radiant
night
it
was
the
first
time
during
our
whole
acquaintance
that
i
had
heard
her
sing
she
had
a
fine
mellow
powerful
voice
and
while
she
sang
i
felt
as
though
i
were
eating
a
ripe
sweet
fragrant
melon
she
ended
the
audience
applauded
and
she
smiled
very
much
pleased
making
play
with
her
eyes
turning
over
the
music
smoothing
her
skirts
like
a
bird
that
has
at
last
broken
out
of
its
cage
and
preens
its
wings
in
freedom
her
hair
was
arranged
over
her
ears
and
she
had
an
unpleasant
defiant
expression
in
her
face
as
though
she
wanted
to
throw
down
a
challenge
to
us
all
or
to
shout
to
us
as
she
did
to
her
horses
hey
there
my
beauties
and
she
must
at
that
moment
have
been
very
much
like
her
grandfather
the
you
here
too
she
said
giving
me
her
hand
did
you
hear
me
sing
well
what
did
you
think
of
it
and
without
waiting
for
my
answer
she
went
on
it
a
very
good
thing
you
are
here
i
am
going
to
petersburg
for
a
short
time
you
let
me
go
you
at
midnight
i
went
with
her
to
the
station
she
embraced
me
affectionately
probably
feeling
grateful
to
me
for
not
asking
unnecessary
questions
and
she
promised
to
write
to
me
and
i
held
her
hands
a
long
time
and
kissed
them
hardly
able
to
restrain
my
tears
and
not
uttering
a
word
and
when
she
had
gone
i
stood
watching
the
retreating
lights
caressing
her
in
imagination
and
softly
murmuring
my
darling
masha
glorious
masha
i
spent
the
night
at
karpovna
and
next
morning
i
was
at
work
with
radish
the
furniture
of
a
rich
merchant
who
was
marrying
his
daughter
to
a
doctor
xvii
my
sister
came
after
dinner
on
sunday
and
had
tea
with
me
i
read
a
great
deal
now
she
said
showing
me
the
books
which
she
had
fetched
from
the
public
library
on
her
way
to
me
thanks
to
your
wife
and
to
vladimir
they
have
awakened
me
to
they
have
been
my
salvation
they
have
made
me
feel
myself
a
human
being
in
old
days
i
used
to
lie
awake
at
night
with
worries
of
all
sorts
thinking
what
a
lot
of
sugar
we
had
used
in
the
week
or
hoping
the
cucumbers
would
not
be
too
salt
and
now
too
i
lie
awake
at
night
but
i
have
different
thoughts
i
am
distressed
that
half
my
life
has
been
passed
in
such
a
foolish
cowardly
way
i
despise
my
past
i
am
ashamed
of
it
and
i
look
upon
our
father
now
as
my
enemy
oh
how
grateful
i
am
to
your
wife
and
vladimir
he
is
such
a
wonderful
person
they
have
opened
my
eyes
that
bad
that
you
do
sleep
at
night
i
said
do
you
think
i
am
ill
not
at
all
vladimir
sounded
me
and
said
i
was
perfectly
well
but
health
is
not
what
matters
it
is
not
so
important
tell
me
am
i
right
she
needed
moral
support
that
was
obvious
masha
had
gone
away
blagovo
was
in
petersburg
and
there
was
no
one
left
in
the
town
but
me
to
tell
her
she
was
right
she
looked
intently
into
my
face
trying
to
read
my
secret
thoughts
and
if
i
were
absorbed
or
silent
in
her
presence
she
thought
this
was
on
her
account
and
was
grieved
i
always
had
to
be
on
my
guard
and
when
she
asked
me
whether
she
was
right
i
hastened
to
assure
her
that
she
was
right
and
that
i
had
a
deep
respect
for
her
do
you
know
they
have
given
me
a
part
at
the
azhogins
she
went
on
i
want
to
act
on
the
stage
i
want
to
live
in
fact
i
mean
to
drain
the
full
cup
i
have
no
talent
none
and
the
part
is
only
ten
lines
but
still
this
is
immeasurably
finer
and
loftier
than
pouring
out
tea
five
times
a
day
and
looking
to
see
if
the
cook
has
eaten
too
much
above
all
let
my
father
see
i
am
capable
of
protest
after
tea
she
lay
down
on
my
bed
and
lay
for
a
little
while
with
her
eyes
closed
looking
very
pale
what
weakness
she
said
getting
up
vladimir
says
all
women
and
girls
are
anæmic
from
doing
nothing
what
a
clever
man
vladimir
is
he
is
right
absolutely
right
we
must
work
two
days
later
she
came
to
the
azhogins
with
her
manuscript
for
the
rehearsal
she
was
wearing
a
black
dress
with
a
string
of
coral
round
her
neck
and
a
brooch
that
in
the
distance
was
like
a
pastry
puff
and
in
her
ears
earrings
sparkling
with
brilliants
when
i
looked
at
her
i
felt
uncomfortable
i
was
struck
by
her
lack
of
taste
that
she
had
very
inappropriately
put
on
earrings
and
brilliants
and
that
she
was
strangely
dressed
was
remarked
by
other
people
too
i
saw
smiles
on
people
faces
and
heard
someone
say
with
a
laugh
kleopatra
of
egypt
she
was
trying
to
assume
society
manners
to
be
unconstrained
and
at
her
ease
and
so
seemed
artificial
and
strange
she
had
lost
simplicity
and
sweetness
i
told
father
just
now
that
i
was
going
to
the
rehearsal
she
began
coming
up
to
me
and
he
shouted
that
he
would
not
give
me
his
blessing
and
actually
almost
struck
me
only
fancy
i
know
my
part
she
said
looking
at
her
manuscript
i
am
sure
to
make
a
mess
of
it
so
be
it
the
die
is
cast
she
went
on
in
intense
excitement
the
die
is
cast
it
seemed
to
her
that
everyone
was
looking
at
her
and
that
all
were
amazed
at
the
momentous
step
she
had
taken
that
everyone
was
expecting
something
special
of
her
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
convince
her
that
no
one
was
paying
attention
to
people
so
petty
and
insignificant
as
she
and
i
were
she
had
nothing
to
do
till
the
third
act
and
her
part
that
of
a
visitor
a
provincial
crony
consisted
only
in
standing
at
the
door
as
though
listening
and
then
delivering
a
brief
monologue
in
the
interval
before
her
appearance
an
hour
and
a
half
at
least
while
they
were
moving
about
on
the
stage
reading
their
parts
drinking
tea
and
arguing
she
did
not
leave
my
side
and
was
all
the
time
muttering
her
part
and
nervously
crumpling
up
the
manuscript
and
imagining
that
everyone
was
looking
at
her
and
waiting
for
her
appearance
with
a
trembling
hand
she
smoothed
back
her
hair
and
said
to
me
i
shall
certainly
make
a
mess
of
it
what
a
load
on
my
heart
if
only
you
knew
i
feel
frightened
as
though
i
were
just
going
to
be
led
to
execution
at
last
her
turn
came
kleopatra
alexyevna
it
your
cue
said
the
stage
manager
she
came
forward
into
the
middle
of
the
stage
with
an
expression
of
horror
on
her
face
looking
ugly
and
angular
and
for
half
a
minute
stood
as
though
in
a
trance
perfectly
motionless
and
only
her
big
earrings
shook
in
her
ears
the
first
time
you
can
read
it
said
someone
it
was
clear
to
me
that
she
was
trembling
and
trembling
so
much
that
she
could
not
speak
and
could
not
unfold
her
manuscript
and
that
she
was
incapable
of
acting
her
part
and
i
was
already
on
the
point
of
going
to
her
and
saying
something
when
she
suddenly
dropped
on
her
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
and
broke
into
loud
sobs
all
was
commotion
and
hubbub
i
alone
stood
still
leaning
against
the
side
scene
overwhelmed
by
what
had
happened
not
understanding
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
i
saw
them
lift
her
up
and
lead
her
away
i
saw
anyuta
blagovo
come
up
to
me
i
had
not
seen
her
in
the
room
before
and
she
seemed
to
have
sprung
out
of
the
earth
she
was
wearing
her
hat
and
veil
and
as
always
had
an
air
of
having
come
only
for
a
moment
i
told
her
not
to
take
a
part
she
said
angrily
jerking
out
each
word
abruptly
and
turning
crimson
it
insanity
you
ought
to
have
prevented
her
madame
azhogin
in
a
short
jacket
with
short
sleeves
with
cigarette
ash
on
her
breast
looking
thin
and
flat
came
rapidly
towards
me
my
dear
this
is
terrible
she
brought
out
wringing
her
hands
and
as
her
habit
was
looking
intently
into
my
face
this
is
terrible
your
sister
is
in
a
condition
she
is
with
child
take
her
away
i
implore
you
she
was
breathless
with
agitation
while
on
one
side
stood
her
three
daughters
exactly
like
her
thin
and
flat
huddling
together
in
a
scared
way
they
were
alarmed
overwhelmed
as
though
a
convict
had
been
caught
in
their
house
what
a
disgrace
how
dreadful
and
yet
this
estimable
family
had
spent
its
life
waging
war
on
superstition
evidently
they
imagined
that
all
the
superstition
and
error
of
humanity
was
limited
to
the
three
candles
the
thirteenth
of
the
month
and
to
the
unluckiness
of
monday
i
beg
you
i
beg
repeated
madame
azhogin
pursing
up
her
lips
in
the
shape
of
a
heart
on
the
syllable
you
i
beg
you
to
take
her
home
xviii
a
little
later
my
sister
and
i
were
walking
along
the
street
i
covered
her
with
the
skirts
of
my
coat
we
hastened
choosing
back
streets
where
there
were
no
street
lamps
avoiding
it
was
as
though
we
were
running
away
she
was
no
longer
crying
but
looked
at
me
with
dry
eyes
to
karpovna
where
i
took
her
it
was
only
twenty
minutes
walk
and
strange
to
say
in
that
short
time
we
succeeded
in
thinking
of
our
whole
life
we
talked
over
everything
considered
our
position
reflected
we
decided
we
could
not
go
on
living
in
this
town
and
that
when
i
had
earned
a
little
money
we
would
move
to
some
other
place
in
some
houses
everyone
was
asleep
in
others
they
were
playing
cards
we
hated
these
houses
we
were
afraid
of
them
we
talked
of
the
fanaticism
the
coarseness
of
feeling
the
insignificance
of
these
respectable
families
these
amateurs
of
dramatic
art
whom
we
had
so
alarmed
and
i
kept
asking
in
what
way
these
stupid
cruel
lazy
and
dishonest
people
were
superior
to
the
drunken
and
superstitious
peasants
of
kurilovka
or
in
what
way
they
were
better
than
animals
who
in
the
same
way
are
thrown
into
a
panic
when
some
incident
disturbs
the
monotony
of
their
life
limited
by
their
instincts
what
would
have
happened
to
my
sister
now
if
she
had
been
left
to
live
at
home
what
moral
agonies
would
she
have
experienced
talking
with
my
father
meeting
every
day
with
acquaintances
i
imagined
this
to
myself
and
at
once
there
came
into
my
mind
people
all
people
i
knew
who
had
been
slowly
done
to
death
by
their
nearest
relations
i
remembered
the
tortured
dogs
driven
mad
the
live
sparrows
plucked
naked
by
boys
and
flung
into
the
water
and
a
long
long
series
of
obscure
lingering
miseries
which
i
had
looked
on
continually
from
early
childhood
in
that
town
and
i
could
not
understand
what
these
sixty
thousand
people
lived
for
what
they
read
the
gospel
for
why
they
prayed
why
they
read
books
and
magazines
what
good
had
they
gained
from
all
that
had
been
said
and
written
hitherto
if
they
were
still
possessed
by
the
same
spiritual
darkness
and
hatred
of
liberty
as
they
were
a
hundred
and
three
hundred
years
ago
a
master
carpenter
spends
his
whole
life
building
houses
in
the
town
and
always
to
the
day
of
his
death
calls
a
gallery
a
galdery
so
these
sixty
thousand
people
have
been
reading
and
hearing
of
truth
of
justice
of
mercy
of
freedom
for
generations
and
yet
from
morning
till
night
till
the
day
of
their
death
they
are
lying
and
tormenting
each
other
and
they
fear
liberty
and
hate
it
as
a
deadly
foe
and
so
my
fate
is
decided
said
my
sister
as
we
arrived
home
after
what
has
happened
i
can
not
go
back
heavens
how
good
that
is
my
heart
feels
lighter
she
went
to
bed
at
once
tears
were
glittering
on
her
eyelashes
but
her
expression
was
happy
she
fell
into
a
sound
sweet
sleep
and
one
could
see
that
her
heart
was
lighter
and
that
she
was
resting
it
was
a
long
long
time
since
she
had
slept
like
that
and
so
we
began
our
life
together
she
was
always
singing
and
saying
that
her
life
was
very
happy
and
the
books
i
brought
her
from
the
public
library
i
took
back
unread
as
now
she
could
not
read
she
wanted
to
do
nothing
but
dream
and
talk
of
the
future
mending
my
linen
or
helping
karpovna
near
the
stove
she
was
always
singing
or
talking
of
her
vladimir
of
his
cleverness
of
his
charming
manners
of
his
kindness
of
his
extraordinary
learning
and
i
assented
to
all
she
said
though
by
now
i
disliked
her
doctor
she
wanted
to
work
to
lead
an
independent
life
on
her
own
account
and
she
used
to
say
that
she
would
become
a
or
a
assistant
as
soon
as
her
health
would
permit
her
and
would
herself
do
the
scrubbing
and
the
washing
already
she
was
passionately
devoted
to
her
child
he
was
not
yet
born
but
she
knew
already
the
colour
of
his
eyes
what
his
hands
would
be
like
and
how
he
would
laugh
she
was
fond
of
talking
about
education
and
as
her
vladimir
was
the
best
man
in
the
world
all
her
discussion
of
education
could
be
summed
up
in
the
question
how
to
make
the
boy
as
fascinating
as
his
father
there
was
no
end
to
her
talk
and
everything
she
said
made
her
intensely
joyful
sometimes
i
was
delighted
too
though
i
could
not
have
said
why
i
suppose
her
dreaminess
infected
me
i
too
gave
up
reading
and
did
nothing
but
dream
in
the
evenings
in
spite
of
my
fatigue
i
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
my
hands
in
my
pockets
talking
of
masha
what
do
you
think
i
would
ask
of
my
sister
when
will
she
come
back
i
think
she
come
back
at
christmas
not
later
what
has
she
to
do
there
as
she
does
write
to
you
it
evident
she
will
come
back
very
soon
that
true
i
assented
though
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
masha
would
not
return
to
our
town
i
missed
her
fearfully
and
could
no
longer
deceive
myself
and
tried
to
get
other
people
to
deceive
me
my
sister
was
expecting
her
doctor
and
i
masha
and
both
of
us
talked
incessantly
laughed
and
did
not
notice
that
we
were
preventing
karpovna
from
sleeping
she
lay
on
the
stove
and
kept
muttering
the
samovar
hummed
this
morning
it
did
hum
oh
it
bodes
no
good
my
dears
it
bodes
no
good
no
one
ever
came
to
see
us
but
the
postman
who
brought
my
sister
letters
from
the
doctor
and
prokofy
who
sometimes
came
in
to
see
us
in
the
evening
and
after
looking
at
my
sister
without
speaking
went
away
and
when
he
was
in
the
kitchen
said
every
class
ought
to
remember
its
rules
and
anyone
who
is
so
proud
that
he
wo
understand
that
will
find
it
a
vale
of
tears
he
was
very
fond
of
the
phrase
a
vale
of
tears
one
day
it
was
in
christmas
week
when
i
was
walking
by
the
bazaar
he
called
me
into
the
butcher
shop
and
not
shaking
hands
with
me
announced
that
he
had
to
speak
to
me
about
something
very
important
his
face
was
red
from
the
frost
and
vodka
near
him
behind
the
counter
stood
nikolka
with
the
expression
of
a
brigand
holding
a
bloodstained
knife
in
his
hand
i
desire
to
express
my
word
to
you
prokofy
began
this
incident
can
not
continue
because
as
you
understand
yourself
that
for
such
a
vale
people
will
say
nothing
good
of
you
or
of
us
mamma
through
pity
can
not
say
something
unpleasant
to
you
that
your
sister
should
move
into
another
lodging
on
account
of
her
condition
but
i
wo
have
it
any
more
because
i
ca
approve
of
her
behaviour
i
understood
him
and
i
went
out
of
the
shop
the
same
day
my
sister
and
i
moved
to
radish
we
had
no
money
for
a
cab
and
we
walked
on
foot
i
carried
a
parcel
of
our
belongings
on
my
back
my
sister
had
nothing
in
her
hands
but
she
gasped
for
breath
and
coughed
and
kept
asking
whether
we
should
get
there
soon
xix
at
last
a
letter
came
from
masha
dear
good
m
a
she
wrote
our
kind
gentle
as
the
old
painter
calls
you
farewell
i
am
going
with
my
father
to
america
for
the
exhibition
in
a
few
days
i
shall
see
the
ocean
so
far
from
dubetchnya
it
dreadful
to
think
it
far
and
unfathomable
as
the
sky
and
i
long
to
be
there
in
freedom
i
am
triumphant
i
am
mad
and
you
see
how
incoherent
my
letter
is
dear
good
one
give
me
my
freedom
make
haste
to
break
the
thread
which
still
holds
binding
you
and
me
together
my
meeting
and
knowing
you
was
a
ray
from
heaven
that
lighted
up
my
existence
but
my
becoming
your
wife
was
a
mistake
you
understand
that
and
i
am
oppressed
now
by
the
consciousness
of
the
mistake
and
i
beseech
you
on
my
knees
my
generous
friend
quickly
quickly
before
i
start
for
the
ocean
telegraph
that
you
consent
to
correct
our
common
mistake
to
remove
the
solitary
stone
from
my
wings
and
my
father
who
will
undertake
all
the
arrangements
promised
me
not
to
burden
you
too
much
with
formalities
and
so
i
am
free
to
fly
whither
i
will
yes
be
happy
and
god
bless
you
forgive
me
a
sinner
i
am
well
i
am
wasting
money
doing
all
sorts
of
silly
things
and
i
thank
god
every
minute
that
such
a
bad
woman
as
i
has
no
children
i
sing
and
have
success
but
it
not
an
infatuation
no
it
my
haven
my
cell
to
which
i
go
for
peace
king
david
had
a
ring
with
an
inscription
on
it
things
pass
when
one
is
sad
those
words
make
one
cheerful
and
when
one
is
cheerful
it
makes
one
sad
i
have
got
myself
a
ring
like
that
with
hebrew
letters
on
it
and
this
talisman
keeps
me
from
infatuations
all
things
pass
life
will
pass
one
wants
nothing
or
at
least
one
wants
nothing
but
the
sense
of
freedom
for
when
anyone
is
free
he
wants
nothing
nothing
nothing
break
the
thread
a
warm
hug
to
you
and
your
sister
forgive
and
forget
your
my
sister
used
to
lie
down
in
one
room
and
radish
who
had
been
ill
again
and
was
now
better
in
another
just
at
the
moment
when
i
received
this
letter
my
sister
went
softly
into
the
room
sat
down
beside
him
and
began
reading
aloud
she
read
to
him
every
day
ostrovsky
or
gogol
and
he
listened
staring
at
one
point
not
laughing
but
shaking
his
head
and
muttering
to
himself
from
time
to
time
anything
may
happen
anything
may
happen
if
anything
ugly
or
unseemly
were
depicted
in
the
play
he
would
say
as
though
vindictively
thrusting
his
finger
into
the
book
there
it
is
lying
that
what
it
does
lying
does
the
plays
fascinated
him
both
from
their
subjects
and
their
moral
and
from
their
skilful
complex
construction
and
he
marvelled
at
him
never
calling
the
author
by
his
name
how
neatly
has
put
it
all
together
this
time
my
sister
read
softly
only
one
page
and
could
read
no
more
her
voice
would
not
last
out
radish
took
her
hand
and
moving
his
parched
lips
said
hardly
audibly
in
a
husky
voice
the
soul
of
a
righteous
man
is
white
and
smooth
as
chalk
but
the
soul
of
a
sinful
man
is
like
pumice
stone
the
soul
of
a
righteous
man
is
like
clear
oil
but
the
soul
of
a
sinful
man
is
gas
tar
we
must
labour
we
must
sorrow
we
must
suffer
sickness
he
went
on
and
he
who
does
not
labour
and
sorrow
will
not
gain
the
kingdom
of
heaven
woe
woe
to
them
that
are
well
fed
woe
to
the
mighty
woe
to
the
rich
woe
to
the
moneylenders
not
for
them
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
lice
eat
grass
rust
eats
iron
and
lying
the
soul
my
sister
added
laughing
i
read
the
letter
through
once
more
at
that
moment
there
walked
into
the
kitchen
a
soldier
who
had
been
bringing
us
twice
a
week
parcels
of
tea
french
bread
and
game
which
smelt
of
scent
from
some
unknown
giver
i
had
no
work
i
had
had
to
sit
at
home
idle
for
whole
days
together
and
probably
whoever
sent
us
the
french
bread
knew
that
we
were
in
want
i
heard
my
sister
talking
to
the
soldier
and
laughing
gaily
then
lying
down
she
ate
some
french
bread
and
said
to
me
when
you
would
go
into
the
service
but
became
a
house
painter
anyuta
blagovo
and
i
knew
from
the
beginning
that
you
were
right
but
we
were
frightened
to
say
so
aloud
tell
me
what
force
is
it
that
hinders
us
from
saying
what
one
thinks
take
anyuta
blagovo
now
for
instance
she
loves
you
she
adores
you
she
knows
you
are
right
she
loves
me
too
like
a
sister
and
knows
that
i
am
right
and
i
daresay
in
her
soul
envies
me
but
some
force
prevents
her
from
coming
to
see
us
she
shuns
us
she
is
afraid
my
sister
crossed
her
arms
over
her
breast
and
said
passionately
how
she
loves
you
if
only
you
knew
she
has
confessed
her
love
to
no
one
but
me
and
then
very
secretly
in
the
dark
she
led
me
into
a
dark
avenue
in
the
garden
and
began
whispering
how
precious
you
were
to
her
you
will
see
she
never
marry
because
she
loves
you
are
you
sorry
for
her
yes
it
she
who
has
sent
the
bread
she
is
absurd
really
what
is
the
use
of
being
so
secret
i
used
to
be
absurd
and
foolish
but
now
i
have
got
away
from
that
and
am
afraid
of
nobody
i
think
and
say
aloud
what
i
like
and
am
happy
when
i
lived
at
home
i
had
a
conception
of
happiness
and
now
i
would
change
with
a
queen
blagovo
arrived
he
had
taken
his
doctor
degree
and
was
now
staying
in
our
town
with
his
father
he
was
taking
a
rest
and
said
that
he
would
soon
go
back
to
petersburg
again
he
wanted
to
study
against
typhus
and
i
believe
cholera
he
wanted
to
go
abroad
to
perfect
his
training
and
then
to
be
appointed
a
professor
he
had
already
left
the
army
service
and
wore
a
roomy
serge
reefer
jacket
very
full
trousers
and
magnificent
neckties
my
sister
was
in
ecstasies
over
his
scarfpin
his
studs
and
the
red
silk
handkerchief
which
he
wore
i
suppose
from
foppishness
sticking
out
of
the
breast
pocket
of
his
jacket
one
day
having
nothing
to
do
she
and
i
counted
up
all
the
suits
we
remembered
him
wearing
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
at
least
ten
it
was
clear
that
he
still
loved
my
sister
as
before
but
he
never
once
even
in
jest
spoke
of
taking
her
with
him
to
petersburg
or
abroad
and
i
could
not
picture
to
myself
clearly
what
would
become
of
her
if
she
remained
alive
and
what
would
become
of
her
child
she
did
nothing
but
dream
endlessly
and
never
thought
seriously
of
the
future
she
said
he
might
go
where
he
liked
and
might
abandon
her
even
so
long
as
he
was
happy
himself
that
what
had
been
was
enough
for
her
as
a
rule
he
used
to
sound
her
very
carefully
on
his
arrival
and
used
to
insist
on
her
taking
milk
and
drops
in
his
presence
it
was
the
same
on
this
occasion
he
sounded
her
and
made
her
drink
a
glass
of
milk
and
there
was
a
smell
of
creosote
in
our
room
afterwards
that
a
good
girl
he
said
taking
the
glass
from
her
you
must
talk
too
much
now
you
taken
to
chattering
like
a
magpie
of
late
please
hold
your
tongue
she
laughed
then
he
came
into
radish
room
where
i
was
sitting
and
affectionately
slapped
me
on
the
shoulder
well
how
goes
it
old
man
he
said
bending
down
to
the
invalid
your
honour
said
radish
moving
his
lips
slowly
your
honour
i
venture
to
submit
we
all
walk
in
the
fear
of
god
we
all
have
to
die
permit
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
your
honour
the
kingdom
of
heaven
will
not
be
for
you
there
no
help
for
it
the
doctor
said
jestingly
there
must
be
somebody
in
hell
you
know
and
all
at
once
something
happened
with
my
consciousness
as
though
i
were
in
a
dream
as
though
i
were
standing
on
a
winter
night
in
the
slaughterhouse
yard
and
prokofy
beside
me
smelling
of
pepper
cordial
i
made
an
effort
to
control
myself
and
rubbed
my
eyes
and
at
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
going
along
the
road
to
the
interview
with
the
governor
nothing
of
the
sort
had
happened
to
me
before
or
has
happened
to
me
since
and
these
strange
memories
that
were
like
dreams
i
ascribed
to
overexhaustion
of
my
nerves
i
lived
through
the
scene
at
the
slaughterhouse
and
the
interview
with
the
governor
and
at
the
same
time
was
dimly
aware
that
it
was
not
real
when
i
came
to
myself
i
saw
that
i
was
no
longer
in
the
house
but
in
the
street
and
was
standing
with
the
doctor
near
a
it
sad
it
sad
he
was
saying
and
tears
were
trickling
down
his
cheeks
she
is
in
good
spirits
she
always
laughing
and
hopeful
but
her
position
hopeless
dear
boy
your
radish
hates
me
and
is
always
trying
to
make
me
feel
that
i
have
treated
her
badly
he
is
right
from
his
standpoint
but
i
have
my
point
of
view
too
and
i
shall
never
regret
all
that
has
happened
one
must
love
we
ought
all
to
love
ought
we
there
would
be
no
life
without
love
anyone
who
fears
and
avoids
love
is
not
free
little
by
little
he
passed
to
other
subjects
began
talking
of
science
of
his
dissertation
which
had
been
liked
in
petersburg
he
was
carried
away
by
his
subject
and
no
longer
thought
of
my
sister
nor
of
his
grief
nor
of
me
life
was
of
absorbing
interest
to
him
she
has
america
and
her
ring
with
the
inscription
on
it
i
thought
while
this
fellow
has
his
doctor
degree
and
a
chair
to
look
forward
to
and
only
my
sister
and
i
are
left
with
the
old
things
when
i
said
to
him
i
went
up
to
the
and
read
the
letter
once
more
and
i
remembered
i
remembered
vividly
how
that
spring
morning
she
had
come
to
me
at
the
mill
lain
down
and
covered
herself
with
her
jacket
she
wanted
to
be
like
a
simple
peasant
woman
and
how
another
time
it
was
in
the
morning
also
we
drew
the
net
out
of
the
water
and
heavy
drops
of
rain
fell
upon
us
from
the
riverside
willows
and
we
laughed
it
was
dark
in
our
house
in
great
dvoryansky
street
i
got
over
the
fence
and
as
i
used
to
do
in
the
old
days
went
by
the
back
way
to
the
kitchen
to
borrow
a
lantern
there
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
the
samovar
hissed
near
the
stove
waiting
for
my
father
who
pours
out
my
father
tea
now
i
thought
taking
the
lantern
i
went
out
to
the
shed
built
myself
up
a
bed
of
old
newspapers
and
lay
down
the
hooks
on
the
walls
looked
forbidding
as
they
used
to
of
old
and
their
shadows
flickered
it
was
cold
i
felt
that
my
sister
would
come
in
in
a
minute
and
bring
me
supper
but
at
once
i
remembered
that
she
was
ill
and
was
lying
at
radish
and
it
seemed
to
me
strange
that
i
should
have
climbed
over
the
fence
and
be
lying
here
in
this
unheated
shed
my
mind
was
in
a
maze
and
i
saw
all
sorts
of
absurd
things
there
was
a
ring
a
ring
familiar
from
childhood
first
the
wire
rustled
against
the
wall
then
a
short
plaintive
ring
in
the
kitchen
it
was
my
father
come
back
from
the
club
i
got
up
and
went
into
the
kitchen
axinya
the
cook
clasped
her
hands
on
seeing
me
and
for
some
reason
burst
into
tears
my
own
she
said
softly
my
precious
o
lord
and
she
began
crumpling
up
her
apron
in
her
agitation
in
the
window
there
were
standing
jars
of
berries
in
vodka
i
poured
myself
out
a
teacupful
and
greedily
drank
it
off
for
i
was
intensely
thirsty
axinya
had
quite
recently
scrubbed
the
table
and
benches
and
there
was
that
smell
in
the
kitchen
which
is
found
in
bright
snug
kitchens
kept
by
tidy
cooks
and
that
smell
and
the
chirp
of
the
cricket
used
to
lure
us
as
children
into
the
kitchen
and
put
us
in
the
mood
for
hearing
fairy
tales
and
playing
at
kings
where
kleopatra
axinya
asked
softly
in
a
fluster
holding
her
breath
and
where
is
your
cap
my
dear
your
wife
you
say
has
gone
to
petersburg
she
had
been
our
servant
in
our
mother
time
and
used
once
to
give
kleopatra
and
me
our
baths
and
to
her
we
were
still
children
who
had
to
be
talked
to
for
their
good
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
she
laid
before
me
all
the
reflections
which
she
had
with
the
sagacity
of
an
old
servant
been
accumulating
in
the
stillness
of
that
kitchen
all
the
time
since
we
had
seen
each
other
she
said
that
the
doctor
could
be
forced
to
marry
kleopatra
he
only
needed
to
be
thoroughly
frightened
and
that
if
an
appeal
were
promptly
written
the
bishop
would
annul
the
first
marriage
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
me
to
sell
dubetchnya
without
my
wife
knowledge
and
put
the
money
in
the
bank
in
my
own
name
that
if
my
sister
and
i
were
to
bow
down
at
my
father
feet
and
ask
him
properly
he
might
perhaps
forgive
us
that
we
ought
to
have
a
service
sung
to
the
queen
of
heaven
come
go
along
my
dear
and
speak
to
him
she
said
when
she
heard
my
father
cough
go
along
speak
to
him
bow
down
your
head
wo
drop
off
i
went
in
my
father
was
sitting
at
the
table
sketching
a
plan
of
a
summer
villa
with
gothic
windows
and
with
a
fat
turret
like
a
fireman
watch
tower
something
peculiarly
stiff
and
tasteless
going
into
the
study
i
stood
still
where
i
could
see
this
drawing
i
did
not
know
why
i
had
gone
in
to
my
father
but
i
remember
that
when
i
saw
his
lean
face
his
red
neck
and
his
shadow
on
the
wall
i
wanted
to
throw
myself
on
his
neck
and
as
axinya
had
told
me
bow
down
at
his
feet
but
the
sight
of
the
summer
villa
with
the
gothic
windows
and
the
fat
turret
restrained
me
good
evening
i
said
he
glanced
at
me
and
at
once
dropped
his
eyes
on
his
drawing
what
do
you
want
he
asked
after
waiting
a
little
i
have
come
to
tell
you
my
sister
very
she
ca
live
very
long
i
added
in
a
hollow
voice
well
sighed
my
father
taking
off
his
spectacles
and
laying
them
on
the
table
what
thou
sowest
that
shalt
thou
reap
what
thou
sowest
he
repeated
getting
up
from
the
table
that
shalt
thou
reap
i
ask
you
to
remember
how
you
came
to
me
two
years
ago
and
on
this
very
spot
i
begged
you
i
besought
you
to
give
up
your
errors
i
reminded
you
of
your
duty
of
your
honour
of
what
you
owed
to
your
forefathers
whose
traditions
we
ought
to
preserve
as
sacred
did
you
obey
me
you
scorned
my
counsels
and
obstinately
persisted
in
clinging
to
your
false
ideals
worse
still
you
drew
your
sister
into
the
path
of
error
with
you
and
led
her
to
lose
her
moral
principles
and
sense
of
shame
now
you
are
both
in
a
bad
way
well
as
thou
sowest
so
shalt
thou
reap
as
he
said
this
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
he
probably
imagined
that
i
had
come
to
him
to
confess
my
wrong
doings
and
he
probably
expected
that
i
should
begin
begging
him
to
forgive
my
sister
and
me
i
was
cold
i
was
shivering
as
though
i
were
in
a
fever
and
spoke
with
difficulty
in
a
husky
voice
and
i
beg
you
too
to
remember
i
said
on
this
very
spot
i
besought
you
to
understand
me
to
reflect
to
decide
with
me
how
and
for
what
we
should
live
and
in
answer
you
began
talking
about
our
forefathers
about
my
grandfather
who
wrote
poems
one
tells
you
now
that
your
only
daughter
is
hopelessly
ill
and
you
go
on
again
about
your
forefathers
your
traditions
and
such
frivolity
in
your
old
age
when
death
is
close
at
hand
and
you
have
more
than
five
or
ten
years
left
what
have
you
come
here
for
my
father
asked
sternly
evidently
offended
at
my
reproaching
him
for
his
frivolity
i
do
know
i
love
you
i
am
unutterably
sorry
that
we
are
so
far
apart
so
you
see
i
have
come
i
love
you
still
but
my
sister
has
broken
with
you
completely
she
does
not
forgive
you
and
will
never
forgive
you
now
your
very
name
arouses
her
aversion
for
the
past
for
life
and
who
is
to
blame
for
it
cried
my
father
it
your
fault
you
scoundrel
well
suppose
it
is
my
fault
i
said
i
admit
i
have
been
to
blame
in
many
things
but
why
is
it
that
this
life
of
yours
which
you
think
binding
upon
us
too
why
is
it
so
dreary
so
barren
how
is
it
that
in
not
one
of
these
houses
you
have
been
building
for
the
last
thirty
years
has
there
been
anyone
from
whom
i
might
have
learnt
how
to
live
so
as
not
to
be
to
blame
there
is
not
one
honest
man
in
the
whole
town
these
houses
of
yours
are
nests
of
damnation
where
mothers
and
daughters
are
made
away
with
where
children
are
tortured
my
poor
mother
i
went
on
in
despair
my
poor
sister
one
has
to
stupefy
oneself
with
vodka
with
cards
with
scandal
one
must
become
a
scoundrel
a
hypocrite
or
go
on
drawing
plans
for
years
and
years
so
as
not
to
notice
all
the
horrors
that
lie
hidden
in
these
houses
our
town
has
existed
for
hundreds
of
years
and
all
that
time
it
has
not
produced
one
man
of
service
to
our
country
not
one
you
have
stifled
in
the
germ
everything
in
the
least
living
and
bright
it
a
town
of
shopkeepers
publicans
clerks
canting
hypocrites
it
a
useless
unnecessary
town
which
not
one
soul
would
regret
if
it
suddenly
sank
through
the
earth
i
do
want
to
listen
to
you
you
scoundrel
said
my
father
and
he
took
up
his
ruler
from
the
table
you
are
drunk
do
dare
come
and
see
your
father
in
such
a
state
i
tell
you
for
the
last
time
and
you
can
repeat
it
to
your
depraved
sister
that
get
nothing
from
me
either
of
you
i
have
torn
my
disobedient
children
out
of
my
heart
and
if
they
suffer
for
their
disobedience
and
obstinacy
i
do
not
pity
them
you
can
go
whence
you
came
it
has
pleased
god
to
chastise
me
with
you
but
i
will
bear
the
trial
with
resignation
and
like
job
i
will
find
consolation
in
my
sufferings
and
in
unremitting
labour
you
must
not
cross
my
threshold
till
you
have
mended
your
ways
i
am
a
just
man
all
i
tell
you
is
for
your
benefit
and
if
you
desire
your
own
good
you
ought
to
remember
all
your
life
what
i
say
and
have
said
to
you
i
waved
my
hand
in
despair
and
went
away
i
do
remember
what
happened
afterwards
that
night
and
next
day
i
am
told
that
i
walked
about
the
streets
bareheaded
staggering
and
singing
aloud
while
a
crowd
of
boys
ran
after
me
shouting
xx
if
i
wanted
to
order
a
ring
for
myself
the
inscription
i
should
choose
would
be
nothing
passes
away
i
believe
that
nothing
passes
away
without
leaving
a
trace
and
that
every
step
we
take
however
small
has
significance
for
our
present
and
our
future
existence
what
i
have
been
through
has
not
been
for
nothing
my
great
troubles
my
patience
have
touched
people
hearts
and
now
they
do
call
me
they
do
laugh
at
me
and
when
i
walk
by
the
shops
they
do
throw
water
over
me
they
have
grown
used
to
my
being
a
workman
and
see
nothing
strange
in
my
carrying
a
pail
of
paint
and
putting
in
windows
though
i
am
of
noble
rank
on
the
contrary
people
are
glad
to
give
me
orders
and
i
am
now
considered
a
workman
and
the
best
foreman
after
radish
who
though
he
has
regained
his
health
and
though
as
before
he
paints
the
cupola
on
the
belfry
without
scaffolding
has
no
longer
the
force
to
control
the
workmen
instead
of
him
i
now
run
about
the
town
looking
for
work
i
engage
the
workmen
and
pay
them
borrow
money
at
a
high
rate
of
interest
and
now
that
i
myself
am
a
contractor
i
understand
how
it
is
that
one
may
have
to
waste
three
days
racing
about
the
town
in
search
of
tilers
on
account
of
some
job
people
are
civil
to
me
they
address
me
politely
and
in
the
houses
where
i
work
they
offer
me
tea
and
send
to
enquire
whether
i
would
like
dinner
children
and
young
girls
often
come
and
look
at
me
with
curiosity
and
compassion
one
day
i
was
working
in
the
governor
garden
painting
an
arbour
there
to
look
like
marble
the
governor
walking
in
the
garden
came
up
to
the
arbour
and
having
nothing
to
do
entered
into
conversation
with
me
and
i
reminded
him
how
he
had
once
summoned
me
to
an
interview
with
him
he
looked
into
my
face
intently
for
a
minute
then
made
his
mouth
like
a
round
o
flung
up
his
hands
and
said
i
do
remember
i
have
grown
older
have
become
silent
stern
and
austere
i
rarely
laugh
and
i
am
told
that
i
have
grown
like
radish
and
that
like
him
i
bore
the
workmen
by
my
useless
exhortations
mariya

my
former
wife
is
living
now
abroad
while
her
father
is
constructing
a
railway
somewhere
in
the
eastern
provinces
and
is
buying
estates
there
blagovo
is
also
abroad
dubetchnya
has
passed
again
into
the
possession
of
madame
tcheprakov
who
has
bought
it
after
forcing
the
engineer
to
knock
the
price
down
twenty
per
cent
moisey
goes
about
now
in
a
bowler
hat
he
often
drives
into
the
town
in
a
racing
droshky
on
business
of
some
sort
and
stops
near
the
bank
they
say
he
has
already
bought
up
a
mortgaged
estate
and
is
constantly
making
enquiries
at
the
bank
about
dubetchnya
which
he
means
to
buy
too
poor
ivan
tcheprakov
was
for
a
long
while
out
of
work
staggering
about
the
town
and
drinking
i
tried
to
get
him
into
our
work
and
for
a
time
he
painted
roofs
and
put
in
in
our
company
and
even
got
to
like
it
and
stole
oil
asked
for
tips
and
drank
like
a
regular
painter
but
he
soon
got
sick
of
the
work
and
went
back
to
dubetchnya
and
afterwards
the
workmen
confessed
to
me
that
he
had
tried
to
persuade
them
to
join
him
one
night
and
murder
moisey
and
rob
madame
tcheprakov
my
father
has
greatly
aged
he
is
very
bent
and
in
the
evenings
walks
up
and
down
near
his
house
i
never
go
to
see
him
during
an
epidemic
of
cholera
prokofy
doctored
some
of
the
shopkeepers
with
pepper
cordial
and
pitch
and
took
money
for
doing
so
and
as
i
learned
from
the
newspapers
was
flogged
for
abusing
the
doctors
as
he
sat
in
his
shop
his
shop
boy
nikolka
died
of
cholera
karpovna
is
still
alive
and
as
always
she
loves
and
fears
her
prokofy
when
she
sees
me
she
always
shakes
her
head
mournfully
and
says
with
a
sigh
your
life
is
ruined
on
working
days
i
am
busy
from
morning
till
night
on
holidays
in
fine
weather
i
take
my
tiny
niece
my
sister
reckoned
on
a
boy
but
the
child
is
a
girl
and
walk
in
a
leisurely
way
to
the
cemetery
there
i
stand
or
sit
down
and
stay
a
long
time
gazing
at
the
grave
that
is
so
dear
to
me
and
tell
the
child
that
her
mother
lies
here
sometimes
by
the
graveside
i
find
anyuta
blagovo
we
greet
each
other
and
stand
in
silence
or
talk
of
kleopatra
of
her
child
of
how
sad
life
is
in
this
world
then
going
out
of
the
cemetery
we
walk
along
in
silence
and
she
slackens
her
pace
on
purpose
to
walk
beside
me
a
little
longer
the
little
girl
joyous
and
happy
pulls
at
her
hand
laughing
and
screwing
up
her
eyes
in
the
bright
sunlight
and
we
stand
still
and
join
in
caressing
the
dear
child
when
we
reach
the
town
anyuta
blagovo
agitated
and
flushing
crimson
says
to
me
and
walks
on
alone
austere
and
respectable
and
no
one
who
met
her
could
looking
at
her
imagine
that
she
had
just
been
walking
beside
me
and
even
caressing
the
child
at
a
country
house
pavel
ilyitch
rashevitch
walked
up
and
down
stepping
softly
on
the
floor
covered
with
little
russian
plaids
and
casting
a
long
shadow
on
the
wall
and
ceiling
while
his
guest
meier
the
deputy
examining
magistrate
sat
on
the
sofa
with
one
leg
drawn
up
under
him
smoking
and
listening
the
clock
already
pointed
to
eleven
and
there
were
sounds
of
the
table
being
laid
in
the
room
next
to
the
study
say
what
you
like
rashevitch
was
saying
from
the
standpoint
of
fraternity
equality
and
the
rest
of
it
mitka
the
swineherd
is
perhaps
a
man
the
same
as
goethe
and
frederick
the
great
but
take
your
stand
on
a
scientific
basis
have
the
courage
to
look
facts
in
the
face
and
it
will
be
obvious
to
you
that
blue
blood
is
not
a
mere
prejudice
that
it
is
not
a
feminine
invention
blue
blood
my
dear
fellow
has
an
historical
justification
and
to
refuse
to
recognize
it
is
to
my
thinking
as
strange
as
to
refuse
to
recognize
the
antlers
on
a
stag
one
must
reckon
with
facts
you
are
a
law
student
and
have
confined
your
attention
to
the
humane
studies
and
you
can
still
flatter
yourself
with
illusions
of
equality
fraternity
and
so
on
i
am
an
incorrigible
darwinian
and
for
me
words
such
as
lineage
aristocracy
noble
blood
are
not
empty
sounds
rashevitch
was
roused
and
spoke
with
feeling
his
eyes
sparkled
his
would
not
stay
on
his
nose
he
kept
nervously
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
blinking
and
at
the
word
darwinian
he
looked
jauntily
in
the
and
combed
his
grey
beard
with
both
hands
he
was
wearing
a
very
short
and
shabby
reefer
jacket
and
narrow
trousers
the
rapidity
of
his
movements
his
jaunty
air
and
his
abbreviated
jacket
all
seemed
out
of
keeping
with
him
and
his
big
comely
head
with
long
hair
suggestive
of
a
bishop
or
a
veteran
poet
seemed
to
have
been
fixed
on
to
the
body
of
a
tall
lanky
affected
youth
when
he
stood
with
his
legs
wide
apart
his
long
shadow
looked
like
a
pair
of
scissors
he
was
fond
of
talking
and
he
always
fancied
that
he
was
saying
something
new
and
original
in
the
presence
of
meier
he
was
conscious
of
an
unusual
flow
of
spirits
and
rush
of
ideas
he
found
the
examining
magistrate
sympathetic
and
was
stimulated
by
his
youth
his
health
his
good
manners
his
dignity
and
above
all
by
his
cordial
attitude
to
himself
and
his
family
rashevitch
was
not
a
favourite
with
his
acquaintances
as
a
rule
they
fought
shy
of
him
and
as
he
knew
declared
that
he
had
driven
his
wife
into
her
grave
with
his
talking
and
they
called
him
behind
his
back
a
spiteful
creature
and
a
toad
meier
a
man
new
to
the
district
and
unprejudiced
visited
him
often
and
readily
and
had
even
been
known
to
say
that
rashevitch
and
his
daughters
were
the
only
people
in
the
district
with
whom
he
felt
as
much
at
home
as
with
his
own
people
rashevitch
liked
him
too
because
he
was
a
young
man
who
might
be
a
good
match
for
his
elder
daughter
genya
and
now
enjoying
his
ideas
and
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
and
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
plump
but
neatly
cropped
correct
meier
rashevitch
dreamed
of
how
he
would
arrange
his
daughter
marriage
with
a
good
man
and
then
how
all
his
worries
over
the
estate
would
pass
to
his
hateful
worries
the
interest
owing
to
the
bank
had
not
been
paid
for
the
last
two
quarters
and
fines
and
arrears
of
all
sorts
had
mounted
up
to
more
than
two
thousand
to
my
mind
there
can
be
no
doubt
rashevitch
went
on
growing
more
and
more
enthusiastic
that
if
a
richard
or
frederick
barbarossa
for
instance
is
brave
and
noble
those
qualities
will
pass
by
heredity
to
his
son
together
with
the
convolutions
and
bumps
of
the
brain
and
if
that
courage
and
nobility
of
soul
are
preserved
in
the
son
by
means
of
education
and
exercise
and
if
he
marries
a
princess
who
is
also
noble
and
brave
those
qualities
will
be
transmitted
to
his
grandson
and
so
on
until
they
become
a
generic
characteristic
and
pass
organically
into
the
flesh
and
blood
thanks
to
a
strict
sexual
selection
to
the
fact
that
families
have
instinctively
guarded
themselves
against
marriage
with
their
inferiors
and
young
men
of
high
rank
have
not
married
just
anybody
lofty
spiritual
qualities
have
been
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
in
their
full
purity
have
been
preserved
and
as
time
goes
on
have
through
exercise
become
more
exalted
and
lofty
for
the
fact
that
there
is
good
in
humanity
we
are
indebted
to
nature
to
the
normal
natural
consistent
order
of
things
which
has
throughout
the
ages
scrupulously
segregated
blue
blood
from
plebeian
yes
my
dear
boy
no
low
lout
no
cook
son
has
given
us
literature
science
art
law
conceptions
of
honour
and
duty
for
all
these
things
mankind
is
indebted
exclusively
to
the
aristocracy
and
from
that
point
of
view
the
point
of
view
of
natural
history
an
inferior
sobakevitch
by
the
very
fact
of
his
blue
blood
is
superior
and
more
useful
than
the
very
best
merchant
even
though
the
latter
may
have
built
fifteen
museums
say
what
you
like
and
when
i
refuse
to
shake
hands
with
a
low
lout
or
a
son
or
to
let
him
sit
down
to
table
with
me
by
that
very
act
i
am
safeguarding
what
is
the
best
thing
on
earth
and
am
carrying
out
one
of
mother
nature
finest
designs
for
leading
us
up
to
perfection
rashevitch
stood
still
combing
his
beard
with
both
hands
his
shadow
too
stood
still
on
the
wall
looking
like
a
pair
of
scissors
take
now
he
went
on
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
standing
first
on
his
heels
and
then
on
his
toes
who
are
her
best
people
take
our
painters
writers
composers
who
are
they
they
were
all
of
aristocratic
origin
pushkin
lermontov
turgenev
gontcharov
tolstoy
they
were
not
children
gontcharov
was
a
merchant
said
meier
well
the
exception
only
proves
the
rule
besides
genius
is
quite
open
to
dispute
but
let
us
drop
names
and
turn
to
facts
what
would
you
say
my
good
sir
for
instance
to
this
eloquent
fact
when
one
of
the
mob
forces
his
way
where
he
has
not
been
permitted
before
into
society
into
the
world
of
learning
of
literature
into
the
zemstvo
or
the
law
courts
observe
nature
herself
first
of
all
champions
the
higher
rights
of
humanity
and
is
the
first
to
wage
war
on
the
rabble
as
soon
as
the
plebeian
forces
himself
into
a
place
he
is
not
fit
for
he
begins
to
ail
to
go
into
consumption
to
go
out
of
his
mind
and
to
degenerate
and
nowhere
do
we
find
so
many
puny
neurotic
wrecks
consumptives
and
starvelings
of
all
sorts
as
among
these
darlings
they
die
like
flies
in
autumn
if
it
were
not
for
this
providential
degeneration
there
would
not
have
been
a
stone
left
standing
of
our
civilization
the
rabble
would
have
demolished
everything
tell
me
if
you
please
what
has
the
inroad
of
the
barbarians
given
us
so
far
what
has
the
rabble
brought
with
it
rashevitch
assumed
a
mysterious
frightened
expression
and
went
on
never
has
literature
and
learning
been
at
such
low
ebb
among
us
as
now
the
men
of
my
good
sir
have
neither
ideas
nor
ideals
and
all
their
sayings
and
doings
are
permeated
by
one
spirit
to
get
all
they
can
and
to
strip
someone
to
his
last
thread
all
these
men
of
who
give
themselves
out
as
honest
and
progressive
people
can
be
bought
at
a
rouble
a
piece
and
the
distinguishing
mark
of
the
of
is
that
you
have
to
keep
strict
watch
over
your
pocket
when
you
talk
to
him
or
else
he
will
run
off
with
your
purse
rashevitch
winked
and
burst
out
laughing
upon
my
soul
he
will
he
said
in
a
thin
gleeful
voice
and
morals
what
of
their
morals
rashevitch
looked
round
towards
the
door
no
one
is
surprised
nowadays
when
a
wife
robs
and
leaves
her
husband
what
that
a
trifle
nowadays
my
dear
boy
a
chit
of
a
girl
of
twelve
is
scheming
to
get
a
lover
and
all
these
amateur
theatricals
and
literary
evenings
are
only
invented
to
make
it
easier
to
get
a
rich
merchant
to
take
a
girl
on
as
his
mistress
mothers
sell
their
daughters
and
people
make
no
bones
about
asking
a
husband
at
what
price
he
sells
his
wife
and
one
can
haggle
over
the
bargain
you
know
my
dear
meier
who
had
been
sitting
motionless
and
silent
all
the
time
suddenly
got
up
from
the
sofa
and
looked
at
his
watch
i
beg
your
pardon
pavel
ilyitch
he
said
it
is
time
for
me
to
be
going
but
pavel
ilyitch
who
had
not
finished
his
remarks
put
his
arm
round
him
and
forcibly
reseating
him
on
the
sofa
vowed
that
he
would
not
let
him
go
without
supper
and
again
meier
sat
and
listened
but
he
looked
at
rashevitch
with
perplexity
and
uneasiness
as
though
he
were
only
now
beginning
to
understand
him
patches
of
red
came
into
his
face
and
when
at
last
a
maidservant
came
in
to
tell
them
that
the
young
ladies
asked
them
to
go
to
supper
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
was
the
first
to
walk
out
of
the
study
at
the
table
in
the
next
room
were
rashevitch
daughters
genya
and
iraida
girls
of
and
respectively
both
very
pale
with
black
eyes
and
exactly
the
same
height
genya
had
her
hair
down
and
iraida
had
hers
done
up
high
on
her
head
before
eating
anything
they
each
drank
a
wineglassful
of
bitter
liqueur
with
an
air
as
though
they
had
drunk
it
by
accident
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
and
both
were
overcome
with
confusion
and
burst
out
laughing
do
be
naughty
girls
said
rashevitch
genya
and
iraida
talked
french
with
each
other
and
russian
with
their
father
and
their
visitor
interrupting
one
another
and
mixing
up
french
words
with
russian
they
began
rapidly
describing
how
just
at
this
time
in
august
in
previous
years
they
had
set
off
to
the
boarding
school
and
what
fun
it
had
been
now
there
was
nowhere
to
go
and
they
had
to
stay
at
their
home
in
the
country
summer
and
winter
without
change
such
dreariness
do
be
naughty
girls
rashevitch
said
again
he
wanted
to
be
talking
himself
if
other
people
talked
in
his
presence
he
suffered
from
a
feeling
like
jealousy
so
that
how
it
is
my
dear
boy
he
began
looking
affectionately
at
meier
in
the
simplicity
and
goodness
of
our
hearts
and
from
fear
of
being
suspected
of
being
behind
the
times
we
fraternize
with
excuse
me
all
sorts
of
we
preach
fraternity
and
equality
with
and
innkeepers
but
if
we
would
only
think
we
should
see
how
criminal
that
is
we
have
brought
things
to
such
a
pass
that
the
fate
of
civilization
is
hanging
on
a
hair
my
dear
fellow
what
our
forefathers
gained
in
the
course
of
ages
will
be
if
not
outraged
and
destroyed
by
these
modern
huns
after
supper
they
all
went
into
the
genya
and
iraida
lighted
the
candles
on
the
piano
got
out
their
music
but
their
father
still
went
on
talking
and
there
was
no
telling
when
he
would
leave
off
they
looked
with
misery
and
vexation
at
their
to
whom
the
pleasure
of
chattering
and
displaying
his
intelligence
was
evidently
more
precious
and
important
than
his
daughters
happiness
meier
the
only
young
man
who
ever
came
to
their
house
came
they
knew
for
the
sake
of
their
charming
feminine
society
but
the
irrepressible
old
man
had
taken
possession
of
him
and
would
not
let
him
move
a
step
away
just
as
the
knights
of
the
west
repelled
the
invasions
of
the
mongols
so
we
before
it
is
too
late
ought
to
unite
and
strike
together
against
our
foe
rashevitch
went
on
in
the
tone
of
a
preacher
holding
up
his
right
hand
may
i
appear
to
the
not
as
pavel
ilyitch
but
as
a
mighty
menacing
richard
let
us
give
up
sloppy
sentimentality
enough
of
it
let
us
all
make
a
compact
that
as
soon
as
a
plebeian
comes
near
us
we
fling
some
careless
phrase
straight
in
his
ugly
face
off
go
back
to
your
kennel
you
cur
straight
in
his
ugly
face
rashevitch
went
on
gleefully
flicking
his
crooked
finger
in
front
of
him
in
his
ugly
face
i
ca
do
that
meier
brought
out
turning
away
why
not
rashevitch
answered
briskly
anticipating
a
prolonged
and
interesting
argument
why
not
because
i
am
of
the
artisan
class
myself
as
he
said
this
meier
turned
crimson
and
his
neck
seemed
to
swell
and
tears
actually
gleamed
in
his
eyes
my
father
was
a
simple
workman
he
said
in
a
rough
jerky
voice
but
i
see
no
harm
in
that
rashevitch
was
fearfully
confused
dumbfoundered
as
though
he
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
a
crime
he
gazed
helplessly
at
meier
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
genya
and
iraida
flushed
crimson
and
bent
over
their
music
they
were
ashamed
of
their
tactless
father
a
minute
passed
in
silence
and
there
was
a
feeling
of
unbearable
discomfort
when
all
at
once
with
a
sort
of
painful
stiffness
and
inappropriateness
there
sounded
in
the
air
the
words
yes
i
am
of
the
artisan
class
and
i
am
proud
of
it
thereupon
meier
stumbling
awkwardly
among
the
furniture
took
his
leave
and
walked
rapidly
into
the
hall
though
his
carriage
was
not
yet
at
the
door
you
have
a
dark
drive
rashevitch
muttered
following
him
the
moon
does
not
rise
till
late
they
stood
together
on
the
steps
in
the
dark
and
waited
for
the
horses
to
be
brought
it
was
cool
there
a
falling
star
said
meier
wrapping
himself
in
his
overcoat
there
are
a
great
many
in
august
when
the
horses
were
at
the
door
rashevitch
gazed
intently
at
the
sky
and
said
with
a
sigh
a
phenomenon
worthy
of
the
pen
of
flammarion
after
seeing
his
visitor
off
he
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
gesticulating
in
the
darkness
reluctant
to
believe
that
such
a
queer
stupid
misunderstanding
had
only
just
occurred
he
was
ashamed
and
vexed
with
himself
in
the
first
place
it
had
been
extremely
incautious
and
tactless
on
his
part
to
raise
the
damnable
subject
of
blue
blood
without
finding
out
beforehand
what
his
position
was
something
of
the
same
sort
had
happened
to
him
before
he
had
on
one
occasion
in
a
railway
carriage
begun
abusing
the
germans
and
it
had
afterwards
appeared
that
all
the
persons
he
had
been
conversing
with
were
german
in
the
second
place
he
felt
that
meier
would
never
come
and
see
him
again
these
intellectuals
who
have
risen
from
the
people
are
morbidly
sensitive
obstinate
and
slow
to
forgive
it
bad
it
bad
muttered
rashevitch
spitting
he
had
a
feeling
of
discomfort
and
loathing
as
though
he
had
eaten
soap
ah
bad
he
could
see
from
the
garden
through
the
window
genya
by
the
piano
very
pale
and
looking
scared
with
her
hair
down
she
was
talking
very
very
rapidly
iraida
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
lost
in
thought
but
now
she
too
began
talking
rapidly
with
her
face
full
of
indignation
they
were
both
talking
at
once
rashevitch
could
not
hear
a
word
but
he
guessed
what
they
were
talking
about
genya
was
probably
complaining
that
her
father
drove
away
every
decent
person
from
the
house
with
his
talk
and
he
had
driven
away
from
them
their
one
acquaintance
perhaps
a
suitor
and
now
the
poor
young
man
would
not
have
one
place
in
the
whole
district
where
he
could
find
rest
for
his
soul
and
judging
by
the
despairing
way
in
which
she
threw
up
her
arms
iraida
was
talking
probably
on
the
subject
of
their
dreary
existence
their
wasted
youth
when
he
reached
his
own
room
rashevitch
sat
down
on
his
bed
and
began
to
undress
he
felt
oppressed
and
he
was
still
haunted
by
the
same
feeling
as
though
he
had
eaten
soap
he
was
ashamed
as
he
undressed
he
looked
at
his
long
sinewy
elderly
legs
and
remembered
that
in
the
district
they
called
him
the
toad
and
after
every
long
conversation
he
always
felt
ashamed
somehow
or
other
by
some
fatality
it
always
happened
that
he
began
mildly
amicably
with
good
intentions
calling
himself
an
old
student
an
idealist
a
quixote
but
without
being
himself
aware
of
it
gradually
passed
into
abuse
and
slander
and
what
was
most
surprising
with
perfect
sincerity
criticized
science
art
and
morals
though
he
had
not
read
a
book
for
the
last
twenty
years
had
been
nowhere
farther
than
their
provincial
town
and
did
not
really
know
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
if
he
sat
down
to
write
anything
if
it
were
only
a
letter
of
congratulation
there
would
somehow
be
abuse
in
the
letter
and
all
this
was
strange
because
in
reality
he
was
a
man
of
feeling
given
to
tears
could
he
be
possessed
by
some
devil
which
hated
and
slandered
in
him
apart
from
his
own
will
it
bad
he
sighed
as
he
lay
down
under
the
quilt
it
bad
his
daughters
did
not
sleep
either
there
was
a
sound
of
laughter
and
screaming
as
though
someone
was
being
pursued
it
was
genya
in
hysterics
a
little
later
iraida
was
sobbing
too
a
maidservant
ran
barefoot
up
and
down
the
passage
several
times
what
a
business
good
lord
muttered
rashevitch
sighing
and
tossing
from
side
to
side
it
bad
he
had
a
nightmare
he
dreamt
he
was
standing
naked
as
tall
as
a
giraffe
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
saying
as
he
flicked
his
finger
before
him
in
his
ugly
face
his
ugly
face
his
ugly
face
he
woke
up
in
a
fright
and
first
of
all
remembered
that
a
misunderstanding
had
happened
in
the
evening
and
that
meier
would
certainly
not
come
again
he
remembered
too
that
he
had
to
pay
the
interest
at
the
bank
to
find
husbands
for
his
daughters
that
one
must
have
food
and
drink
and
close
at
hand
were
illness
old
age
unpleasantnesses
that
soon
it
would
be
winter
and
that
there
was
no
wood
it
was
past
nine
in
the
morning
rashevitch
slowly
dressed
drank
his
tea
and
ate
two
hunks
of
bread
and
butter
his
daughters
did
not
come
down
to
breakfast
they
did
not
want
to
meet
him
and
that
wounded
him
he
lay
down
on
his
sofa
in
his
study
then
sat
down
to
his
table
and
began
writing
a
letter
to
his
daughters
his
hand
shook
and
his
eyes
smarted
he
wrote
that
he
was
old
and
no
use
to
anyone
and
that
nobody
loved
him
and
he
begged
his
daughters
to
forget
him
and
when
he
died
to
bury
him
in
a
plain
deal
coffin
without
ceremony
or
to
send
his
body
to
harkov
to
the
dissecting
theatre
he
felt
that
every
line
he
wrote
reeked
of
malice
and
affectation
but
he
could
not
stop
and
went
on
writing
and
writing
the
toad
he
suddenly
heard
from
the
next
room
it
was
the
voice
of
his
elder
daughter
a
voice
with
a
hiss
of
indignation
the
toad
the
toad
the
younger
one
repeated
like
an
echo
the
toad
a
father
i
admit
i
have
had
a
drop
you
must
excuse
me
i
went
into
a
beer
shop
on
the
way
here
and
as
it
was
so
hot
had
a
couple
of
bottles
it
hot
my
boy
old
musatov
took
a
nondescript
rag
out
of
his
pocket
and
wiped
his
shaven
battered
face
with
it
i
have
come
only
for
a
minute
borenka
my
angel
he
went
on
not
looking
at
his
son
about
something
very
important
excuse
me
perhaps
i
am
hindering
you
have
you
ten
roubles
my
dear
you
could
let
me
have
till
tuesday
you
see
i
ought
to
have
paid
for
my
lodging
yesterday
and
money
you
see
none
not
to
save
my
life
young
musatov
went
out
without
a
word
and
began
whispering
the
other
side
of
the
door
with
the
landlady
of
the
summer
villa
and
his
colleagues
who
had
taken
the
villa
with
him
three
minutes
later
he
came
back
and
without
a
word
gave
his
father
a
note
the
latter
thrust
it
carelessly
into
his
pocket
without
looking
at
it
and
said
well
how
are
you
getting
on
it
a
long
time
since
we
met
yes
a
long
time
not
since
easter
half
a
dozen
times
i
have
been
meaning
to
come
to
you
but
never
had
time
first
one
thing
then
another
it
simply
awful
i
am
talking
nonsense
though
all
that
nonsense
do
you
believe
me
borenka
i
said
i
would
pay
you
back
the
ten
roubles
on
tuesday
do
believe
that
either
do
believe
a
word
i
say
i
have
nothing
to
do
at
all
it
simply
laziness
drunkenness
and
i
am
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
such
clothes
in
the
street
you
must
excuse
me
borenka
here
i
have
sent
the
girl
to
you
three
times
for
money
and
written
you
piteous
letters
thanks
for
the
money
but
do
believe
the
letters
i
was
telling
fibs
i
am
ashamed
to
rob
you
my
angel
i
know
that
you
can
scarcely
make
both
ends
meet
yourself
and
feed
on
locusts
but
my
impudence
is
too
much
for
me
i
am
such
a
specimen
of
impudence
fit
for
a
show
you
must
excuse
me
borenka
i
tell
you
the
truth
because
i
ca
see
your
angel
face
without
emotion
a
minute
passed
in
silence
the
old
man
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
said
you
might
treat
me
to
a
glass
of
beer
perhaps
his
son
went
out
without
a
word
and
again
there
was
a
sound
of
whispering
the
other
side
of
the
door
when
a
little
later
the
beer
was
brought
in
the
old
man
seemed
to
revive
at
the
sight
of
the
bottles
and
abruptly
changed
his
tone
i
was
at
the
races
the
other
day
my
boy
he
began
telling
him
assuming
a
scared
expression
we
were
a
party
of
three
and
we
pooled
three
roubles
on
frisky
and
thanks
to
that
frisky
we
got
roubles
each
for
our
rouble
i
ca
get
on
without
the
races
my
boy
it
a
gentlemanly
diversion
my
virago
always
gives
me
a
dressing
over
the
races
but
i
go
i
love
it
and
that
all
about
it
boris
a
young
man
with
a
melancholy
immobile
face
was
walking
slowly
up
and
down
listening
in
silence
when
the
old
man
stopped
to
clear
his
throat
he
went
up
to
him
and
said
i
bought
myself
a
pair
of
boots
the
other
day
father
which
turn
out
to
be
too
tight
for
me
wo
you
take
them
i
let
you
have
them
cheap
if
you
like
said
the
old
man
with
a
grimace
only
for
the
price
you
gave
for
them
without
any
cheapening
very
well
i
let
you
have
them
on
credit
the
son
groped
under
the
bed
and
produced
the
new
boots
the
father
took
off
his
clumsy
rusty
evidently
boots
and
began
trying
on
the
new
ones
a
perfect
fit
he
said
right
let
me
keep
them
and
on
tuesday
when
i
get
my
pension
i
send
you
the
money
for
them
that
not
true
though
he
went
on
suddenly
falling
into
the
same
tearful
tone
again
and
it
was
a
lie
about
the
races
too
and
a
lie
about
the
pension
and
you
are
deceiving
me
borenka
i
feel
your
generous
tactfulness
i
see
through
you
your
boots
were
too
small
because
your
heart
is
too
big
ah
borenka
borenka
i
understand
it
all
and
feel
it
have
you
moved
into
new
lodgings
his
son
interrupted
to
change
the
conversation
yes
my
boy
i
move
every
month
my
virago
ca
stay
long
in
the
same
place
with
her
temper
i

borenka
some
neighbours
a
wretched
crew
came
to

with

and
i
blackguarded
you
poor
children
for
all
i
was
worth
i
abused
you
and
complained
that
you
had
abandoned
me
i
wanted
you

to
touch
the
drunken
hussies
hearts
and
pose
as
an
unhappy
father
it
my
way

when
i
want
to
screen
my
vices
i
throw
all
the
blame
on

innocent
children
i
ca
tell
lies
and
hide
things
from
you
borenka
i
came
to
see
you
as
proud
as
a
peacock
but
when
i
saw
your
gentleness
and
kind
heart
my
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
it
upset
my
conscience
completely
hush
father
let
talk
of
something
else
mother
of
god
what
children
i
have
the
old
man
went
on
not
heeding
his
son
what
wealth
god
has
bestowed
on
me
such
children
ought
not
to
have
had
a
black
sheep
like
me
for
a
father
but
a
real
man
with
soul
and
feeling
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
the
old
man
took
off
his
cap
with
a
button
at
the
top
and
crossed
himself
several
times
thanks
be
to
thee
o
lord
he
said
with
a
sigh
looking
from
side
to
side
as
though
seeking
for
an
ikon
remarkable
exceptional
children
i
have
three
sons
and
they
are
all
like
one
sober
steady
and
what
brains
cabman
what
brains
grigory
alone
has
brains
enough
for
ten
he
speaks
french
he
speaks
german
and
talks
better
than
any
of
your
lawyers
one
is
never
tired
of
listening
my
children
my
children
i
ca
believe
that
you
are
mine
i
ca
believe
it
you
are
a
martyr
my
borenka
i
am
ruining
you
and
i
shall
go
on
ruining
you
you
give
to
me
endlessly
though
you
know
your
money
is
thrown
away
the
other
day
i
sent
you
a
pitiful
letter
i
described
how
ill
i
was
but
you
know
i
was
lying
i
wanted
the
money
for
rum
and
you
give
to
me
because
you
are
afraid
to
wound
me
by
refusing
i
know
all
that
and
feel
it
grisha
a
martyr
too
on
thursday
i
went
to
his
office
drunk
filthy
ragged
reeking
of
vodka
like
a
cellar
i
went
straight
up
such
a
figure
i
pestered
him
with
nasty
talk
while
his
colleagues
and
superiors
and
petitioners
were
standing
round
i
have
disgraced
him
for
life
and
he
was
the
least
confused
only
turned
a
bit
pale
but
smiled
and
came
up
to
me
as
though
there
were
nothing
the
matter
even
introduced
me
to
his
colleagues
then
he
took
me
all
the
way
home
and
not
a
word
of
reproach
i
rob
him
worse
than
you
take
your
brother
sasha
now
he
a
martyr
too
he
married
as
you
know
a
colonel
daughter
of
an
aristocratic
circle
and
got
a
dowry
with
her
you
would
think
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
no
brother
after
his
wedding
he
came
with
his
young
wife
and
paid
me
the
first
visit
in
my
hole
upon
my
soul
the
old
man
gave
a
sob
and
then
began
laughing
and
at
that
moment
as
luck
would
have
it
we
were
eating
grated
radish
with
kvass
and
frying
fish
and
there
was
a
stink
enough
in
the
flat
to
make
the
devil
sick
i
was
lying
down
i
had
a
drop
my
virago
bounced
out
at
the
young
people
with
her
face
crimson
it
was
a
disgrace
in
fact
but
sasha
rose
superior
to
it
all
yes
our
sasha
is
a
good
fellow
said
boris
the
most
splendid
fellow
you
are
all
pure
gold
you
and
grisha
and
sasha
and
sonya
i
worry
you
torment
you
disgrace
you
rob
you
and
all
my
life
i
have
not
heard
one
word
of
reproach
from
you
you
have
never
given
me
one
cross
look
it
would
be
all
very
well
if
i
had
been
a
decent
father
to
you
but
as
it
is
you
have
had
nothing
from
me
but
harm
i
am
a
bad
dissipated
man
now
thank
god
i
am
quieter
and
i
have
no
strength
of
will
but
in
old
days
when
you
were
little
i
had
determination
will
whatever
i
said
or
did
i
always
thought
it
was
right
sometimes
i
come
home
from
the
club
at
night
drunk
and
and
scold
at
your
poor
mother
for
spending
money
the
whole
night
i
would
be
railing
at
her
and
think
it
the
right
thing
too
you
would
get
up
in
the
morning
and
go
to
school
while
i
still
be
venting
my
temper
upon
her
heavens
i
did
torture
her
poor
martyr
when
you
came
back
from
school
and
i
was
asleep
you
did
dare
to
have
dinner
till
i
got
up
at
dinner
again
there
would
be
a
flare
up
i
daresay
you
remember
i
wish
no
one
such
a
father
god
sent
me
to
you
for
a
trial
yes
for
a
trial
hold
out
children
to
the
end
honour
thy
father
and
thy
days
shall
be
long
perhaps
for
your
noble
conduct
god
will
grant
you
long
life
cabman
stop
the
old
man
jumped
out
of
the
cab
and
ran
into
a
tavern
half
an
hour
later
he
came
back
cleared
his
throat
in
a
drunken
way
and
sat
down
beside
his
son
where
sonya
now
he
asked
still
at
no
she
left
in
may
and
is
living
now
with
sasha

the
old
man
in
surprise
she
is
a
jolly
good
girl
so
she
is
following
her
brother
example
ah
borenka
she
has
no
mother

over
her
i
say
borenka
does
she

she
know
how
i
am
living
eh
boris
made
no
answer
five
minutes
passed
in
profound
silence
the
old
man
gave
a
sob
wiped
his
face
with
a
rag
and
said
i
love
her
borenka
she
is
my
only
daughter
you
know
and
in
one
old
age
there
is
no
comfort
like

daughter

i
see
her
borenka
of
course
when
you
like
really
and
she
wo
mind
of
course

has
been
trying
to
find
you

my
soul

refined
way

to
show
myself
to
her
in
such
an
abject
state
i
tell
you
how
we
contrive
to
work
it
for
three
days

will
keep
away
from
spirits
to
get
my
filthy
drunken
phiz
into
better
order

come
to
you
and
you
shall
lend
me
for
the
time
some
suit
of

and
have
my
hair
cut
then
you
go
and
bring
her
to
your
flat
will
you
very
well
cabman
stop
the
old
man
sprang
out
of
the
cab
again
and
ran
into
a
tavern
while
boris
was
driving
with
him
to
his
lodging
he
jumped
out
twice
again
while
his
son
sat
silent
and
waited
patiently
for
him
when
after
dismissing
the
cab
they
made
their
way
across
a
long
filthy
yard
to
the
virago
lodging
the
old
man
put
on
an
utterly
shamefaced
and
guilty
air
and
began
timidly
clearing
his
throat
and
clicking
with
his
lips
borenka
he
said
in
an
ingratiating
voice
if
my
virago
begins
saying
anything
do
take
any
notice
and
behave
to
her
you
know
affably
she
is
ignorant
and
impudent
but
she
a
good
baggage
there
is
a
good
warm
heart
beating
in
her
bosom
the
long
yard
ended
and
boris
found
himself
in
a
dark
entry
the
swing
door
creaked
there
was
a
smell
of
cooking
and
a
smoking
samovar
there
was
a
sound
of
harsh
voices
passing
through
the
passage
into
the
kitchen
boris
could
see
nothing
but
thick
smoke
a
line
with
washing
on
it
and
the
chimney
of
the
samovar
through
a
crack
of
which
golden
sparks
were
dropping
and
here
is
my
cell
said
the
old
man
stooping
down
and
going
into
a
little
room
with
a
ceiling
and
an
atmosphere
unbearably
stifling
from
the
proximity
of
the
kitchen
here
three
women
were
sitting
at
the
table
regaling
themselves
seeing
the
visitors
they
exchanged
glances
and
left
off
eating
well
did
you
get
it
one
of
them
apparently
the
virago
herself
asked
abruptly
yes
yes
muttered
the
old
man
well
boris
pray
sit
down
everything
is
plain
here
young
man
we
live
in
a
simple
way
he
bustled
about
in
an
aimless
way
he
felt
ashamed
before
his
son
and
at
the
same
time
apparently
he
wanted
to
keep
up
before
the
women
his
dignity
as
cock
of
the
walk
and
as
a
forsaken
unhappy
father
yes
young
man
we
live
simply
with
no
nonsense
he
went
on
muttering
we
are
simple
people
young
man
we
are
not
like
you
we
do
want
to
keep
up
a
show
before
people
no
shall
we
have
a
drink
of
vodka
one
of
the
women
she
was
ashamed
to
drink
before
a
stranger
heaved
a
sigh
and
said
well
i
have
another
drink
on
account
of
the
mushrooms
they
are
such
mushrooms
they
make
you
drink
even
if
you
do
want
to
ivan
gerasimitch
offer
the
young
gentleman
perhaps
he
will
have
a
drink
the
last
word
she
pronounced
in
a
mincing
drawl
have
a
drink
young
man
said
the
father
not
looking
at
his
son
we
have
no
wine
or
liqueurs
my
boy
we
live
in
a
plain
way
he
does
like
our
ways
sighed
the
virago
never
mind
never
mind
he
have
a
drink
not
to
offend
his
father
by
refusing
boris
took
a
wineglass
and
drank
in
silence
when
they
brought
in
the
samovar
to
satisfy
the
old
man
he
drank
two
cups
of
disgusting
tea
in
silence
with
a
melancholy
face
without
a
word
he
listened
to
the
virago
dropping
hints
about
there
being
in
this
world
cruel
heartless
children
who
abandon
their
parents
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
now
said
the
old
man
after
drinking
more
and
passing
into
his
habitual
state
of
drunken
excitement
you
think
i
have
let
myself
sink
into
the
mire
that
i
am
to
be
pitied
but
to
my
thinking
this
simple
life
is
much
more
normal
than
your
life
i
do
need
anybody
and
and
i
intend
to
eat
humble
pie
i
ca
endure
a
wretched
looking
at
me
with
compassion
after
tea
he
cleaned
a
herring
and
sprinkled
it
with
onion
with
such
feeling
that
tears
of
emotion
stood
in
his
eyes
he
began
talking
again
about
the
races
and
his
winnings
about
some
panama
hat
for
which
he
had
paid
sixteen
roubles
the
day
before
he
told
lies
with
the
same
relish
with
which
he
ate
herring
and
drank
his
son
sat
on
in
silence
for
an
hour
and
began
to
say
i
do
venture
to
keep
you
the
old
man
said
haughtily
you
must
excuse
me
young
man
for
not
living
as
you
would
like
he
ruffled
up
his
feathers
snorted
with
dignity
and
winked
at
the
women
young
man
he
said
seeing
his
son
into
the
entry
attendez
in
the
entry
where
it
was
dark
he
suddenly
pressed
his
face
against
the
young
man
sleeve
and
gave
a
sob
i
should
like
to
have
a
look
at
sonitchka
he
whispered
arrange
it
borenka
my
angel
i
shave
i
put
on
your
suit
put
on
a
straight
face
i
hold
my
tongue
while
she
is
there
yes
yes
i
will
hold
my
tongue
he
looked
round
timidly
towards
the
door
through
which
the
voices
were
heard
checked
his
sobs
and
said
aloud
young
man
attendez
on
the
road
upon
the
breast
of
a
gigantic
crag
a
golden
cloudlet
rested
for
one
night
lermontov
in
the
room
which
the
tavern
keeper
the
cossack
semyon
tchistopluy
called
the
travellers
room
that
is
kept
exclusively
for
travellers
a
tall
man
of
forty
was
sitting
at
the
big
unpainted
table
he
was
asleep
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
leaning
on
his
fist
an
end
of
tallow
candle
stuck
into
an
old
pomatum
pot
lighted
up
his
light
brown
beard
his
thick
broad
nose
his
sunburnt
cheeks
and
the
thick
black
eyebrows
overhanging
his
closed
eyes
the
nose
and
the
cheeks
and
the
eyebrows
all
the
features
each
taken
separately
were
coarse
and
heavy
like
the
furniture
and
the
stove
in
the
travellers
room
but
taken
all
together
they
gave
the
effect
of
something
harmonious
and
even
beautiful
such
is
the
lucky
star
as
it
is
called
of
the
russian
face
the
coarser
and
harsher
its
features
the
softer
and
more
it
looks
the
man
was
dressed
in
a
reefer
jacket
shabby
but
bound
with
wide
new
braid
a
plush
waistcoat
and
full
black
trousers
thrust
into
big
high
boots
on
one
of
the
benches
which
stood
in
a
continuous
row
along
the
wall
a
girl
of
eight
in
a
brown
dress
and
long
black
stockings
lay
asleep
on
a
coat
lined
with
fox
her
face
was
pale
her
hair
was
flaxen
her
shoulders
were
narrow
her
whole
body
was
thin
and
frail
but
her
nose
stood
out
as
thick
and
ugly
a
lump
as
the
man
she
was
sound
asleep
and
unconscious
that
her
comb
had
fallen
off
her
head
and
was
cutting
her
cheek
the
travellers
room
had
a
festive
appearance
the
air
was
full
of
the
smell
of
freshly
scrubbed
floors
there
were
no
rags
hanging
as
usual
on
the
line
that
ran
diagonally
across
the
room
and
a
little
lamp
was
burning
in
the
corner
over
the
table
casting
a
patch
of
red
light
on
the
ikon
of
george
the
victorious
from
the
ikon
stretched
on
each
side
of
the
corner
a
row
of
cheap
oleographs
which
maintained
a
strict
and
careful
gradation
in
the
transition
from
the
sacred
to
the
profane
in
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
end
and
the
red
ikon
lamp
the
pictures
looked
like
one
continuous
stripe
covered
with
blurs
of
black
when
the
tiled
stove
trying
to
sing
in
unison
with
the
weather
drew
in
the
air
with
a
howl
while
the
logs
as
though
waking
up
burst
into
bright
flame
and
hissed
angrily
red
patches
began
dancing
on
the
log
walls
and
over
the
head
of
the
sleeping
man
could
be
seen
first
the
elder
seraphim
then
the
shah
then
a
fat
brown
baby
with
goggle
eyes
whispering
in
the
ear
of
a
young
girl
with
an
extraordinarily
blank
and
indifferent
face
outside
a
storm
was
raging
something
frantic
and
wrathful
but
profoundly
unhappy
seemed
to
be
flinging
itself
about
the
tavern
with
the
ferocity
of
a
wild
beast
and
trying
to
break
in
banging
at
the
doors
knocking
at
the
windows
and
on
the
roof
scratching
at
the
walls
it
alternately
threatened
and
besought
then
subsided
for
a
brief
interval
and
then
with
a
gleeful
treacherous
howl
burst
into
the
chimney
but
the
wood
flared
up
and
the
fire
like
a
chained
dog
flew
wrathfully
to
meet
its
foe
a
battle
began
and
after
it
sobs
shrieks
howls
of
wrath
in
all
of
this
there
was
the
sound
of
angry
misery
and
unsatisfied
hate
and
the
mortified
impatience
of
something
accustomed
to
triumph
bewitched
by
this
wild
inhuman
music
the
travellers
room
seemed
spellbound
for
ever
but
all
at
once
the
door
creaked
and
the
potboy
in
a
new
print
shirt
came
in
limping
on
one
leg
and
blinking
his
sleepy
eyes
he
snuffed
the
candle
with
his
fingers
put
some
more
wood
on
the
fire
and
went
out
at
once
from
the
church
which
was
three
hundred
paces
from
the
tavern
the
clock
struck
midnight
the
wind
played
with
the
chimes
as
with
the
snowflakes
chasing
the
sounds
of
the
clock
it
whirled
them
round
and
round
over
a
vast
space
so
that
some
strokes
were
cut
short
or
drawn
out
in
long
vibrating
notes
while
others
were
completely
lost
in
the
general
uproar
one
stroke
sounded
as
distinctly
in
the
room
as
though
it
had
chimed
just
under
the
window
the
child
sleeping
on
the
started
and
raised
her
head
for
a
minute
she
stared
blankly
at
the
dark
window
at
over
whom
a
crimson
glow
from
the
fire
flickered
at
that
moment
then
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
the
sleeping
man
daddy
she
said
but
the
man
did
not
move
the
little
girl
knitted
her
brow
angrily
lay
down
and
curled
up
her
legs
someone
in
the
tavern
gave
a
loud
prolonged
yawn
soon
afterwards
there
was
the
squeak
of
the
swing
door
and
the
sound
of
indistinct
voices
someone
came
in
shaking
the
snow
off
and
stamping
in
felt
boots
which
made
a
muffled
thud
what
is
it
a
woman
voice
asked
languidly
mademoiselle
ilovaisky
has
come
answered
a
bass
voice
again
there
was
the
squeak
of
the
swing
door
then
came
the
roar
of
the
wind
rushing
in
someone
probably
the
lame
boy
ran
to
the
door
leading
to
the
travellers
room
coughed
deferentially
and
lifted
the
latch
this
way
lady
please
said
a
woman
voice
in
dulcet
tones
it
clean
in
here
my
beauty
the
door
was
opened
wide
and
a
peasant
with
a
beard
appeared
in
the
doorway
in
the
long
coat
of
a
coachman
plastered
all
over
with
snow
from
head
to
foot
and
carrying
a
big
trunk
on
his
shoulder
he
was
followed
into
the
room
by
a
feminine
figure
scarcely
half
his
height
with
no
face
and
no
arms
muffled
and
wrapped
up
like
a
bundle
and
also
covered
with
snow
a
damp
chill
as
from
a
cellar
seemed
to
come
to
the
child
from
the
coachman
and
the
bundle
and
the
fire
and
the
candles
flickered
what
nonsense
said
the
bundle
angrily
we
could
go
perfectly
well
we
have
only
nine
more
miles
to
go
mostly
by
the
forest
and
we
should
not
get
lost
as
for
getting
lost
we
should
but
the
horses
ca
go
on
lady
answered
the
coachman
and
it
is
thy
will
o
lord
as
though
i
had
done
it
on
purpose
god
knows
where
you
have
brought
me
well
be
quiet
there
are
people
asleep
here
it
seems
you
can
go
the
coachman
put
the
portmanteau
on
the
floor
and
as
he
did
so
a
great
lump
of
snow
fell
off
his
shoulders
he
gave
a
sniff
and
went
out
then
the
little
girl
saw
two
little
hands
come
out
from
the
middle
of
the
bundle
stretch
upwards
and
begin
angrily
disentangling
the
network
of
shawls
kerchiefs
and
scarves
first
a
big
shawl
fell
on
the
ground
then
a
hood
then
a
white
knitted
kerchief
after
freeing
her
head
the
traveller
took
off
her
pelisse
and
at
once
shrank
to
half
the
size
now
she
was
in
a
long
grey
coat
with
big
buttons
and
bulging
pockets
from
one
pocket
she
pulled
out
a
paper
parcel
from
the
other
a
bunch
of
big
heavy
keys
which
she
put
down
so
carelessly
that
the
sleeping
man
started
and
opened
his
eyes
for
some
time
he
looked
blankly
round
him
as
though
he
know
where
he
was
then
he
shook
his
head
went
to
the
corner
and
sat
down
the
newcomer
took
off
her
great
coat
which
made
her
shrink
to
half
her
size
again
she
took
off
her
big
felt
boots
and
sat
down
too
by
now
she
no
longer
resembled
a
bundle
she
was
a
thin
little
brunette
of
twenty
as
slim
as
a
snake
with
a
long
white
face
and
curly
hair
her
nose
was
long
and
sharp
her
chin
too
was
long
and
sharp
her
eyelashes
were
long
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
sharp
and
thanks
to
this
general
sharpness
the
expression
of
her
face
was
biting
swathed
in
a
closely
fitting
black
dress
with
a
mass
of
lace
at
her
neck
and
sleeves
with
sharp
elbows
and
long
pink
fingers
she
recalled
the
portraits
of
mediæval
english
ladies
the
grave
concentration
of
her
face
increased
this
likeness
the
lady
looked
round
at
the
room
glanced
sideways
at
the
man
and
the
little
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
moved
to
the
window
the
dark
windows
were
shaking
from
the
damp
west
wind
big
flakes
of
snow
glistening
in
their
whiteness
lay
on
the
window
frame
but
at
once
disappeared
borne
away
by
the
wind
the
savage
music
grew
louder
and
louder
after
a
long
silence
the
little
girl
suddenly
turned
over
and
said
angrily
emphasizing
each
word
oh
goodness
goodness
how
unhappy
i
am
unhappier
than
anyone
the
man
got
up
and
moved
with
little
steps
to
the
child
with
a
guilty
air
which
was
utterly
out
of
keeping
with
his
huge
figure
and
big
beard
you
are
not
asleep
dearie
he
said
in
an
apologetic
voice
what
do
you
want
i
do
want
anything
my
shoulder
aches
you
are
a
wicked
man
daddy
and
god
will
punish
you
you
see
he
will
punish
you
my
darling
i
know
your
shoulder
aches
but
what
can
i
do
dearie
said
the
man
in
the
tone
in
which
men
who
have
been
drinking
excuse
themselves
to
their
stern
spouses
it
the
journey
has
made
your
shoulder
ache
sasha
we
shall
get
there
and
rest
and
the
pain
will
go
away
every
day
you
say
we
shall
be
going
on
another
twenty
days
but
we
shall
arrive
dearie
on
your
father
word
of
honour
i
never
tell
a
lie
but
if
we
are
detained
by
the
snowstorm
it
is
not
my
fault
i
ca
bear
any
more
i
ca
i
ca
sasha
jerked
her
leg
abruptly
and
filled
the
room
with
an
unpleasant
wailing
her
father
made
a
despairing
gesture
and
looked
hopelessly
towards
the
young
lady
the
latter
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
hesitatingly
went
up
to
sasha
listen
my
dear
she
said
it
is
no
use
crying
it
really
naughty
if
your
shoulder
aches
it
ca
be
helped
you
see
madam
said
the
man
quickly
as
though
defending
himself
we
have
not
slept
for
two
nights
and
have
been
travelling
in
a
revolting
conveyance
well
of
course
it
is
natural
she
should
be
ill
and
miserable
and
then
you
know
we
had
a
drunken
driver
our
portmanteau
has
been
stolen
the
snowstorm
all
the
time
but
what
the
use
of
crying
madam
i
am
exhausted
though
by
sleeping
in
a
sitting
position
and
i
feel
as
though
i
were
drunk
oh
dear
sasha
and
i
feel
sick
as
it
is
and
then
you
cry
the
man
shook
his
head
and
with
a
gesture
of
despair
sat
down
of
course
you
must
cry
said
the
young
lady
it
only
little
babies
cry
if
you
are
ill
dear
you
must
undress
and
go
to
sleep
let
us
take
off
your
things
when
the
child
had
been
undressed
and
pacified
a
silence
reigned
again
the
young
lady
seated
herself
at
the
window
and
looked
round
wonderingly
at
the
room
of
the
inn
at
the
ikon
at
the
stove
apparently
the
room
and
the
little
girl
with
the
thick
nose
in
her
short
boy
nightgown
and
the
child
father
all
seemed
strange
to
her
this
strange
man
was
sitting
in
a
corner
he
kept
looking
about
him
helplessly
as
though
he
were
drunk
and
rubbing
his
face
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
sat
silent
blinking
and
judging
from
his
figure
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
that
he
would
soon
begin
to
speak
yet
he
was
the
first
to
begin
stroking
his
knees
he
gave
a
cough
laughed
and
said
it
a
comedy
it
really
is
i
look
and
i
can
not
believe
my
eyes
for
what
devilry
has
destiny
driven
us
to
this
accursed
inn
what
did
she
want
to
show
by
it
life
sometimes
performs
such
mortale
one
can
only
stare
and
blink
in
amazement
have
you
come
from
far
madam
no
not
from
far
answered
the
young
lady
i
am
going
from
our
estate
fifteen
miles
from
here
to
our
farm
to
my
father
and
brother
my
name
is
ilovaisky
and
the
farm
is
called
ilovaiskoe
it
nine
miles
away
what
unpleasant
weather
it
could
be
worse
the
lame
boy
came
in
and
stuck
a
new
candle
in
the
pomatum
pot
you
might
bring
us
the
samovar
boy
said
the
man
addressing
him
who
drinks
tea
now
laughed
the
boy
it
is
a
sin
to
drink
tea
before
mass
never
mind
boy
you
wo
burn
in
hell
if
we
do
over
the
tea
the
new
acquaintances
got
into
conversation
mlle
ilovaisky
learned
that
her
companion
was
called
grigory
petrovitch
liharev
that
he
was
the
brother
of
the
liharev
who
was
marshal
of
nobility
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
districts
and
he
himself
had
once
been
a
landowner
but
had
run
through
everything
in
his
time
liharev
learned
that
her
name
was
marya
mihailovna
that
her
father
had
a
huge
estate
but
that
she
was
the
only
one
to
look
after
it
as
her
father
and
brother
looked
at
life
through
their
fingers
were
irresponsible
and
were
too
fond
of
harriers
my
father
and
brother
are
all
alone
at
the
farm
she
told
him
brandishing
her
fingers
she
had
the
habit
of
moving
her
fingers
before
her
pointed
face
as
she
talked
and
after
every
sentence
moistened
her
lips
with
her
sharp
little
tongue
they
i
mean
men
are
an
irresponsible
lot
and
do
stir
a
finger
for
themselves
i
can
fancy
there
will
be
no
one
to
give
them
a
meal
after
the
fast
we
have
no
mother
and
we
have
such
servants
that
they
ca
lay
the
tablecloth
properly
when
i
am
away
you
can
imagine
their
condition
now
they
will
be
left
with
nothing
to
break
their
fast
while
i
have
to
stay
here
all
night
how
strange
it
all
is
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
took
a
sip
from
her
cup
and
said
there
are
festivals
that
have
a
special
fragrance
at
easter
trinity
and
christmas
there
is
a
peculiar
scent
in
the
air
even
unbelievers
are
fond
of
those
festivals
my
brother
for
instance
argues
that
there
is
no
god
but
he
is
the
first
to
hurry
to
matins
at
easter
liharev
raised
his
eyes
to
mlle
ilovaisky
and
laughed
they
argue
that
there
is
no
god
she
went
on
laughing
too
but
why
is
it
tell
me
all
the
celebrated
writers
the
learned
men
clever
people
generally
in
fact
believe
towards
the
end
of
their
life
if
a
man
does
not
know
how
to
believe
when
he
is
young
madam
he
wo
believe
in
his
old
age
if
he
is
ever
so
much
of
a
writer
judging
from
liharev
cough
he
had
a
bass
voice
but
probably
from
being
afraid
to
speak
aloud
or
from
exaggerated
shyness
he
spoke
in
a
tenor
after
a
brief
pause
he
heaved
a
sign
and
said
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
that
faith
is
a
faculty
of
the
spirit
it
is
just
the
same
as
a
talent
one
must
be
born
with
it
so
far
as
i
can
judge
by
myself
by
the
people
i
have
seen
in
my
time
and
by
all
that
is
done
around
us
this
faculty
is
present
in
russians
in
its
highest
degree
russian
life
presents
us
with
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
convictions
and
aspirations
and
if
you
care
to
know
it
has
not
yet
the
faintest
notion
of
lack
of
faith
or
scepticism
if
a
russian
does
not
believe
in
god
it
means
he
believes
in
something
else
liharev
took
a
cup
of
tea
from
mlle
ilovaisky
drank
off
half
in
one
gulp
and
went
on
i
will
tell
you
about
myself
nature
has
implanted
in
my
breast
an
extraordinary
faculty
for
belief
whisper
it
not
to
the
night
but
half
my
life
i
was
in
the
ranks
of
the
atheists
and
nihilists
but
there
was
not
one
hour
in
my
life
in
which
i
ceased
to
believe
all
talents
as
a
rule
show
themselves
in
early
childhood
and
so
my
faculty
showed
itself
when
i
could
still
walk
upright
under
the
table
my
mother
liked
her
children
to
eat
a
great
deal
and
when
she
gave
me
food
she
used
to
say
soup
is
the
great
thing
in
life
i
believed
and
ate
the
soup
ten
times
a
day
ate
like
a
shark
ate
till
i
was
disgusted
and
stupefied
my
nurse
used
to
tell
me
fairy
tales
and
i
believed
in
in
and
in
goblins
of
all
kinds
i
used
sometimes
to
steal
corrosive
sublimate
from
my
father
sprinkle
it
on
cakes
and
carry
them
up
to
the
attic
that
the
you
see
might
eat
them
and
be
killed
and
when
i
was
taught
to
read
and
understand
what
i
read
then
there
was
a
fine
i
ran
away
to
america
and
went
off
to
join
the
brigands
and
wanted
to
go
into
a
monastery
and
hired
boys
to
torture
me
for
being
a
christian
and
note
that
my
faith
was
always
active
never
dead
if
i
was
running
away
to
america
i
was
not
alone
but
seduced
someone
else
as
great
a
fool
as
i
was
to
go
with
me
and
was
delighted
when
i
was
nearly
frozen
outside
the
town
gates
and
when
i
was
thrashed
if
i
went
to
join
the
brigands
i
always
came
back
with
my
face
battered
a
most
restless
childhood
i
assure
you
and
when
they
sent
me
to
the
high
school
and
pelted
me
with
all
sorts
of
truths
that
is
that
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
or
that
white
light
is
not
white
but
is
made
up
of
seven
colours
my
poor
little
head
began
to
go
round
everything
was
thrown
into
a
whirl
in
me
navin
who
made
the
sun
stand
still
and
my
mother
who
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
elijah
disapproved
of
lightning
conductors
and
my
father
who
was
indifferent
to
the
truths
i
had
learned
my
enlightenment
inspired
me
i
wandered
about
the
house
and
stables
like
one
possessed
preaching
my
truths
was
horrified
by
ignorance
glowed
with
hatred
for
anyone
who
saw
in
white
light
nothing
but
white
light
but
all
that
nonsense
and
childishness
serious
so
to
speak
manly
enthusiasms
began
only
at
the
university
you
have
no
doubt
madam
taken
your
degree
somewhere
i
studied
at
novotcherkask
at
the
don
institute
then
you
have
not
been
to
a
university
so
you
do
know
what
science
means
all
the
sciences
in
the
world
have
the
same
passport
without
which
they
regard
themselves
as
meaningless
the
striving
towards
truth
every
one
of
them
even
pharmacology
has
for
its
aim
not
utility
not
the
alleviation
of
life
but
truth
it
remarkable
when
you
set
to
work
to
study
any
science
what
strikes
you
first
of
all
is
its
beginning
i
assure
you
there
is
nothing
more
attractive
and
grander
nothing
is
so
staggering
nothing
takes
a
man
breath
away
like
the
beginning
of
any
science
from
the
first
five
or
six
lectures
you
are
soaring
on
wings
of
the
brightest
hopes
you
already
seem
to
yourself
to
be
welcoming
truth
with
open
arms
and
i
gave
myself
up
to
science
heart
and
soul
passionately
as
to
the
woman
one
loves
i
was
its
slave
i
found
it
the
sun
of
my
existence
and
asked
for
no
other
i
studied
day
and
night
without
rest
ruined
myself
over
books
wept
when
before
my
eyes
men
exploited
science
for
their
own
personal
ends
but
my
enthusiasm
did
not
last
long
the
trouble
is
that
every
science
has
a
beginning
but
not
an
end
like
a
recurring
decimal
zoology
has
discovered
kinds
of
insects
chemistry
reckons
elements
if
in
time
tens
of
noughts
can
be
written
after
these
figures
zoology
and
chemistry
will
be
just
as
far
from
their
end
as
now
and
all
contemporary
scientific
work
consists
in
increasing
these
numbers
i
saw
through
this
trick
when
i
discovered
the
and
felt
no
satisfaction
well
i
had
no
time
to
suffer
from
disillusionment
as
i
was
soon
possessed
by
a
new
faith
i
plunged
into
nihilism
with
its
manifestoes
its
divisions
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
to
the
people
worked
in
factories
worked
as
an
oiler
as
a
barge
hauler
afterwards
when
wandering
over
russia
i
had
a
taste
of
russian
life
i
turned
into
a
fervent
devotee
of
that
life
i
loved
the
russian
people
with
poignant
intensity
i
loved
their
god
and
believed
in
him
and
in
their
language
their
creative
genius
and
so
on
and
so
on
i
have
been
a
slavophile
in
my
time
i
used
to
pester
aksakov
with
letters
and
i
was
a
ukrainophile
and
an
archæologist
and
a
collector
of
specimens
of
peasant
art
i
was
enthusiastic
over
ideas
people
events
places
my
enthusiasm
was
endless
five
years
ago
i
was
working
for
the
abolition
of
private
property
my
last
creed
was
to
evil
sasha
gave
an
abrupt
sigh
and
began
moving
liharev
got
up
and
went
to
her
wo
you
have
some
tea
dearie
he
asked
tenderly
drink
it
yourself
the
child
answered
rudely
liharev
was
disconcerted
and
went
back
to
the
table
with
a
guilty
step
then
you
have
had
a
lively
time
said
mlle
ilovaisky
you
have
something
to
remember
well
yes
it
all
very
lively
when
one
sits
over
tea
and
chatters
to
a
kind
listener
but
you
should
ask
what
that
liveliness
has
cost
me
what
price
have
i
paid
for
the
variety
of
my
life
you
see
madam
i
have
not
held
my
convictions
like
a
german
doctor
of
philosophy
i
have
not
lived
in
solitude
but
every
conviction
i
have
had
has
bound
my
back
to
the
yoke
has
torn
my
body
to
pieces
judge
for
yourself
i
was
wealthy
like
my
brothers
but
now
i
am
a
beggar
in
the
delirium
of
my
enthusiasm
i
smashed
up
my
own
fortune
and
my
wife
a
heap
of
other
money
now
i
am
old
age
is
close
upon
me
and
i
am
homeless
like
a
dog
that
has
dropped
behind
its
waggon
at
night
all
my
life
i
have
not
known
what
peace
meant
my
soul
has
been
in
continual
agitation
distressed
even
by
its
hopes
i
have
been
wearied
out
with
heavy
irregular
work
have
endured
privation
have
five
times
been
in
prison
have
dragged
myself
across
the
provinces
of
archangel
and
of
tobolsk
it
painful
to
think
of
it
i
have
lived
but
in
my
fever
i
have
not
even
been
conscious
of
the
process
of
life
itself
would
you
believe
it
i
do
remember
a
single
spring
i
never
noticed
how
my
wife
loved
me
how
my
children
were
born
what
more
can
i
tell
you
i
have
been
a
misfortune
to
all
who
have
loved
me
my
mother
has
worn
mourning
for
me
all
these
fifteen
years
while
my
proud
brothers
who
have
had
to
wince
to
blush
to
bow
their
heads
to
waste
their
money
on
my
account
have
come
in
the
end
to
hate
me
like
poison
liharev
got
up
and
sat
down
again
if
i
were
simply
unhappy
i
should
thank
god
he
went
on
without
looking
at
his
listener
my
personal
unhappiness
sinks
into
the
background
when
i
remember
how
often
in
my
enthusiasms
i
have
been
absurd
far
from
the
truth
unjust
cruel
dangerous
how
often
i
have
hated
and
despised
those
whom
i
ought
to
have
loved
and
i
have
changed
a
thousand
times
one
day
i
believe
fall
down
and
worship
the
next
i
flee
like
a
coward
from
the
gods
and
friends
of
yesterday
and
swallow
in
silence
the
they
hurl
after
me
god
alone
has
seen
how
often
i
have
wept
and
bitten
my
pillow
in
shame
for
my
enthusiasms
never
once
in
my
life
have
i
intentionally
lied
or
done
evil
but
my
conscience
is
not
clear
i
can
not
even
boast
madam
that
i
have
no
one
life
upon
my
conscience
for
my
wife
died
before
my
eyes
worn
out
by
my
reckless
activity
yes
my
wife
i
tell
you
they
have
two
ways
of
treating
women
nowadays
some
measure
women
skulls
to
prove
woman
is
inferior
to
man
pick
out
her
defects
to
mock
at
her
to
look
original
in
her
eyes
and
to
justify
their
sensuality
others
do
their
utmost
to
raise
women
to
their
level
that
is
force
them
to
learn
by
heart
the
species
to
speak
and
write
the
same
foolish
things
as
they
speak
and
write
themselves
liharev
face
darkened
i
tell
you
that
woman
has
been
and
always
will
be
the
slave
of
man
he
said
in
a
bass
voice
striking
his
fist
on
the
table
she
is
the
soft
tender
wax
which
a
man
always
moulds
into
anything
he
likes
my
god
for
the
sake
of
some
trumpery
masculine
enthusiasm
she
will
cut
off
her
hair
abandon
her
family
die
among
strangers
among
the
ideas
for
which
she
has
sacrificed
herself
there
is
not
a
single
feminine
one
an
unquestioning
devoted
slave
i
have
not
measured
skulls
but
i
say
this
from
hard
bitter
experience
the
proudest
most
independent
women
if
i
have
succeeded
in
communicating
to
them
my
enthusiasm
have
followed
me
without
criticism
without
question
and
done
anything
i
chose
i
have
turned
a
nun
into
a
nihilist
who
as
i
heard
afterwards
shot
a
gendarme
my
wife
never
left
me
for
a
minute
in
my
wanderings
and
like
a
weathercock
changed
her
faith
in
step
with
my
changing
enthusiasms
liharev
jumped
up
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
a
noble
sublime
slavery
he
said
clasping
his
hands
it
is
just
in
it
that
the
highest
meaning
of
woman
life
lies
of
all
the
fearful
medley
of
thoughts
and
impressions
accumulated
in
my
brain
from
my
association
with
women
my
memory
like
a
filter
has
retained
no
ideas
no
clever
saying
no
philosophy
nothing
but
that
extraordinary
resignation
to
fate
that
wonderful
mercifulness
forgiveness
of
everything
liharev
clenched
his
fists
stared
at
a
fixed
point
and
with
a
sort
of
passionate
intensity
as
though
he
were
savouring
each
word
as
he
uttered
it
hissed
through
his
clenched
teeth
that
that
fortitude
faithfulness
unto
death
poetry
of
the
heart
the
meaning
of
life
lies
in
just
that
unrepining
martyrdom
in
the
tears
which
would
soften
a
stone
in
the
boundless
love
which
brings
light
and
warmth
into
the
chaos
of
life
mlle
ilovaisky
got
up
slowly
took
a
step
towards
liharev
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
his
face
from
the
tears
that
glittered
on
his
eyelashes
from
his
quivering
passionate
voice
from
the
flush
on
his
cheeks
it
was
clear
to
her
that
women
were
not
a
chance
not
a
simple
subject
of
conversation
they
were
the
object
of
his
new
enthusiasm
or
as
he
said
himself
his
new
faith
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
saw
a
man
carried
away
fervently
believing
with
his
gesticulations
with
his
flashing
eyes
he
seemed
to
her
mad
frantic
but
there
was
a
feeling
of
such
beauty
in
the
fire
of
his
eyes
in
his
words
in
all
the
movements
of
his
huge
body
that
without
noticing
what
she
was
doing
she
stood
facing
him
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
and
gazed
into
his
face
with
delight
take
my
mother
he
said
stretching
out
his
hand
to
her
with
an
imploring
expression
on
his
face
i
poisoned
her
existence
according
to
her
ideas
disgraced
the
name
of
liharev
did
her
as
much
harm
as
the
most
malignant
enemy
and
what
do
you
think
my
brothers
give
her
little
sums
for
holy
bread
and
church
services
and
outraging
her
religious
feelings
she
saves
that
money
and
sends
it
in
secret
to
her
erring
grigory
this
trifle
alone
elevates
and
ennobles
the
soul
far
more
than
all
the
theories
all
the
clever
sayings
and
the
species
i
can
give
you
thousands
of
instances
take
you
even
for
instance
with
tempest
and
darkness
outside
you
are
going
to
your
father
and
your
brother
to
cheer
them
with
your
affection
in
the
holiday
though
very
likely
they
have
forgotten
and
are
not
thinking
of
you
and
wait
a
bit
and
you
will
love
a
man
and
follow
him
to
the
north
pole
you
would
would
you
yes
if
i
loved
him
there
you
see
cried
liharev
delighted
and
he
even
stamped
with
his
foot
oh
dear
how
glad
i
am
that
i
have
met
you
fate
is
kind
to
me
i
am
always
meeting
splendid
people
not
a
day
passes
but
one
makes
acquaintance
with
somebody
one
would
give
one
soul
for
there
are
ever
so
many
more
good
people
than
bad
in
this
world
here
see
for
instance
how
openly
and
from
our
hearts
we
have
been
talking
as
though
we
had
known
each
other
a
hundred
years
sometimes
i
assure
you
one
restrains
oneself
for
ten
years
and
holds
one
tongue
is
reserved
with
one
friends
and
one
wife
and
meets
some
cadet
in
a
train
and
babbles
one
whole
soul
out
to
him
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
and
yet
i
have
confessed
to
you
as
i
have
never
confessed
in
my
life
why
is
it
rubbing
his
hands
and
smiling
liharev
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
fell
to
talking
about
women
again
meanwhile
they
began
ringing
for
matins
goodness
wailed
sasha
he
wo
let
me
sleep
with
his
talking
oh
yes
said
liharev
startled
i
am
sorry
darling
sleep
sleep
i
have
two
boys
besides
her
he
whispered
they
are
living
with
their
uncle
madam
but
this
one
ca
exist
a
day
without
her
father
she
wretched
she
complains
but
she
sticks
to
me
like
a
fly
to
honey
i
have
been
chattering
too
much
madam
and
it
would
do
you
no
harm
to
sleep
would
you
like
me
to
make
up
a
bed
for
you
without
waiting
for
permission
he
shook
the
wet
pelisse
stretched
it
on
a
bench
fur
side
upwards
collected
various
shawls
and
scarves
put
the
overcoat
folded
up
into
a
roll
for
a
pillow
and
all
this
he
did
in
silence
with
a
look
of
devout
reverence
as
though
he
were
not
handling
a
woman
rags
but
the
fragments
of
holy
vessels
there
was
something
apologetic
embarrassed
about
his
whole
figure
as
though
in
the
presence
of
a
weak
creature
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
height
and
strength
when
mlle
ilovaisky
had
lain
down
he
put
out
the
candle
and
sat
down
on
a
stool
by
the
stove
so
madam
he
whispered
lighting
a
fat
cigarette
and
puffing
the
smoke
into
the
stove
nature
has
put
into
the
russian
an
extraordinary
faculty
for
belief
a
searching
intelligence
and
the
gift
of
speculation
but
all
that
is
reduced
to
ashes
by
irresponsibility
laziness
and
dreamy
frivolity
yes
she
gazed
wonderingly
into
the
darkness
and
saw
only
a
spot
of
red
on
the
ikon
and
the
flicker
of
the
light
of
the
stove
on
face
the
darkness
the
chime
of
the
bells
the
roar
of
the
storm
the
lame
boy
sasha
with
her
fretfulness
unhappy
liharev
and
his
sayings
all
this
was
mingled
together
and
seemed
to
grow
into
one
huge
impression
and
god
world
seemed
to
her
fantastic
full
of
marvels
and
magical
forces
all
that
she
had
heard
was
ringing
in
her
ears
and
human
life
presented
itself
to
her
as
a
beautiful
poetic
without
an
end
the
immense
impression
grew
and
grew
clouded
consciousness
and
turned
into
a
sweet
dream
she
was
asleep
though
she
saw
the
little
ikon
lamp
and
a
big
nose
with
the
light
playing
on
it
she
heard
the
sound
of
weeping
daddy
darling
a
child
voice
was
tenderly
entreating
go
back
to
uncle
there
is
a
there
styopa
and
kolya
are
there
my
darling
what
can
i
do
a
man
bass
persuaded
softly
understand
me
come
understand
and
the
man
weeping
blended
with
the
child
this
voice
of
human
sorrow
in
the
midst
of
the
howling
of
the
storm
touched
the
ear
with
such
sweet
human
music
that
she
could
not
bear
the
delight
of
it
and
wept
too
she
was
conscious
afterwards
of
a
big
black
shadow
coming
softly
up
to
her
picking
up
a
shawl
that
had
dropped
on
to
the
floor
and
carefully
wrapping
it
round
her
feet
mlle
ilovaisky
was
awakened
by
a
strange
uproar
she
jumped
up
and
looked
about
her
in
astonishment
the
deep
blue
dawn
was
looking
in
at
the
window
with
snow
in
the
room
there
was
a
grey
twilight
through
which
the
stove
and
the
sleeping
child
and
stood
out
distinctly
the
stove
and
the
lamp
were
both
out
through
the
door
she
could
see
the
big
tavern
room
with
a
counter
and
chairs
a
man
with
a
stupid
gipsy
face
and
astonished
eyes
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
a
puddle
of
melting
snow
holding
a
big
red
star
on
a
stick
he
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
boys
motionless
as
statues
and
plastered
over
with
snow
the
light
shone
through
the
red
paper
of
the
star
throwing
a
glow
of
red
on
their
wet
faces
the
crowd
was
shouting
in
disorder
and
from
its
uproar
mlle
ilovaisky
could
make
out
only
one
couplet
hi
you
little
russian
lad
bring
your
sharp
knife
we
will
kill
the
jew
we
will
kill
him
the
son
of
tribulation
liharev
was
standing
near
the
counter
looking
feelingly
at
the
singers
and
tapping
his
feet
in
time
seeing
mlle
ilovaisky
he
smiled
all
over
his
face
and
came
up
to
her
she
smiled
too
a
happy
christmas
he
said
i
saw
you
slept
well
she
looked
at
him
said
nothing
and
went
on
smiling
after
the
conversation
in
the
night
he
seemed
to
her
not
tall
and
broad
shouldered
but
little
just
as
the
biggest
steamer
seems
to
us
a
little
thing
when
we
hear
that
it
has
crossed
the
ocean
well
it
is
time
for
me
to
set
off
she
said
i
must
put
on
my
things
tell
me
where
you
are
going
now
i
to
the
station
of
klinushki
from
there
to
sergievo
and
from
sergievo
with
horses
thirty
miles
to
the
coal
mines
that
belong
to
a
horrid
man
a
general
called
shashkovsky
my
brothers
have
got
me
the
post
of
superintendent
there
i
am
going
to
be
a
coal
miner
stay
i
know
those
mines
shashkovsky
is
my
uncle
you
know
but
what
are
you

there
for
asked
mlle
ilovaisky
looking
at
liharev
in
surprise
as
superintendent
to
superintend
the
coal
mines
i
do
understand
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
are
going
to
the
mines
but
you
know
it
the
bare
steppe
a
desert
so
dreary
that
you
could
exist
a
day
there
it
horrible
coal
no
one
will
buy
it
and
my
uncle
a
maniac
a
despot
a
bankrupt
you
wo
get
your
salary
no
matter
said
liharev
unconcernedly
i
am
thankful
even
for
coal
mines
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
walked
about
the
room
in
agitation
i
do
understand
i
do
understand
she
said
moving
her
fingers
before
her
face
it
impossible
and
and
irrational
you
must
understand
that
it
it
worse
than
exile
it
is
a
living
tomb
o
heavens
she
said
hotly
going
up
to
liharev
and
moving
her
fingers
before
his
smiling
face
her
upper
lip
was
quivering
and
her
sharp
face
turned
pale
come
picture
it
the
bare
steppe
solitude
there
is
no
one
to
say
a
word
to
there
and
you
are
enthusiastic
over
women
coal
mines
and
women
mlle
ilovaisky
was
suddenly
ashamed
of
her
heat
and
turning
away
from
liharev
walked
to
the
window
no
no
you
ca
go
there
she
said
moving
her
fingers
rapidly
over
the
pane
not
only
in
her
heart
but
even
in
her
spine
she
felt
that
behind
her
stood
an
infinitely
unhappy
man
lost
and
outcast
while
he
as
though
he
were
unaware
of
his
unhappiness
as
though
he
had
not
shed
tears
in
the
night
was
looking
at
her
with
a
kindly
smile
better
he
should
go
on
weeping
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room
several
times
in
agitation
then
stopped
short
in
a
corner
and
sank
into
thought
liharev
was
saying
something
but
she
did
not
hear
him
turning
her
back
on
him
she
took
out
of
her
purse
a
money
note
stood
for
a
long
time
crumpling
it
in
her
hand
and
looking
round
at
liharev
blushed
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
the
coachman
voice
was
heard
through
the
door
with
a
stern
concentrated
face
she
began
putting
on
her
things
in
silence
liharev
wrapped
her
up
chatting
gaily
but
every
word
he
said
lay
on
her
heart
like
a
weight
it
is
not
cheering
to
hear
the
unhappy
or
the
dying
jest
when
the
transformation
of
a
live
person
into
a
shapeless
bundle
had
been
completed
mlle
ilovaisky
looked
for
the
last
time
round
the
travellers
room
stood
a
moment
in
silence
and
slowly
walked
out
liharev
went
to
see
her
off
outside
god
alone
knows
why
the
winter
was
raging
still
whole
clouds
of
big
soft
snowflakes
were
whirling
restlessly
over
the
earth
unable
to
find
a
the
horses
the
sledge
the
trees
a
bull
tied
to
a
post
all
were
white
and
seemed
soft
and
fluffy
well
god
help
you
muttered
liharev
tucking
her
into
the
sledge
do
remember
evil
against
me
she
was
silent
when
the
sledge
started
and
had
to
go
round
a
huge
snowdrift
she
looked
back
at
liharev
with
an
expression
as
though
she
wanted
to
say
something
to
him
he
ran
up
to
her
but
she
did
not
say
a
word
to
him
she
only
looked
at
him
through
her
long
eyelashes
with
little
specks
of
snow
on
them
whether
his
finely
intuitive
soul
were
really
able
to
read
that
look
or
whether
his
imagination
deceived
him
it
suddenly
began
to
seem
to
him
that
with
another
touch
or
two
that
girl
would
have
forgiven
him
his
failures
his
age
his
desolate
position
and
would
have
followed
him
without
question
or
reasonings
he
stood
a
long
while
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
gazing
at
the
tracks
left
by
the
sledge
runners
the
snowflakes
greedily
settled
on
his
hair
his
beard
his
shoulders
soon
the
track
of
the
runners
had
vanished
and
he
himself
covered
with
snow
began
to
look
like
a
white
rock
but
still
his
eyes
kept
seeking
something
in
the
clouds
of
snow
rothschild
fiddle
the
town
was
a
little
one
worse
than
a
village
and
it
was
inhabited
by
scarcely
any
but
old
people
who
died
with
an
infrequency
that
was
really
annoying
in
the
hospital
and
in
the
prison
fortress
very
few
coffins
were
needed
in
fact
business
was
bad
if
yakov
ivanov
had
been
an
undertaker
in
the
chief
town
of
the
province
he
would
certainly
have
had
a
house
of
his
own
and
people
would
have
addressed
him
as
yakov
matveyitch
here
in
this
wretched
little
town
people
called
him
simply
yakov
his
nickname
in
the
street
was
for
some
reason
bronze
and
he
lived
in
a
poor
way
like
a
humble
peasant
in
a
little
old
hut
in
which
there
was
only
one
room
and
in
this
room
he
and
marfa
the
stove
a
double
bed
the
coffins
his
bench
and
all
their
belongings
were
crowded
together
yakov
made
good
solid
coffins
for
peasants
and
working
people
he
made
them
to
fit
himself
and
this
was
never
unsuccessful
for
there
were
none
taller
and
stronger
than
he
even
in
the
prison
though
he
was
seventy
for
gentry
and
for
women
he
made
them
to
measure
and
used
an
iron
for
the
purpose
he
was
very
unwilling
to
take
orders
for
children
coffins
and
made
them
straight
off
without
measurements
contemptuously
and
when
he
was
paid
for
the
work
he
always
said
i
must
confess
i
do
like
trumpery
jobs
apart
from
his
trade
playing
the
fiddle
brought
him
in
a
small
income
the
jews
orchestra
conducted
by
moisey
ilyitch
shahkes
the
tinsmith
who
took
more
than
half
their
receipts
for
himself
played
as
a
rule
at
weddings
in
the
town
as
yakov
played
very
well
on
the
fiddle
especially
russian
songs
shahkes
sometimes
invited
him
to
join
the
orchestra
at
a
fee
of
half
a
rouble
a
day
in
addition
to
tips
from
the
visitors
when
bronze
sat
in
the
orchestra
first
of
all
his
face
became
crimson
and
perspiring
it
was
hot
there
was
a
suffocating
smell
of
garlic
the
fiddle
squeaked
the
double
bass
wheezed
close
to
his
right
ear
while
the
flute
wailed
at
his
left
played
by
a
gaunt
jew
who
had
a
perfect
network
of
red
and
blue
veins
all
over
his
face
and
who
bore
the
name
of
the
famous
millionaire
rothschild
and
this
accursed
jew
contrived
to
play
even
the
liveliest
things
plaintively
for
no
apparent
reason
yakov
little
by
little
became
possessed
by
hatred
and
contempt
for
the
jews
and
especially
for
rothschild
he
began
to
pick
quarrels
with
him
rail
at
him
in
unseemly
language
and
once
even
tried
to
strike
him
and
rothschild
was
offended
and
said
looking
at
him
ferociously
if
it
were
not
that
i
respect
you
for
your
talent
i
would
have
sent
you
flying
out
of
the
window
then
he
began
to
weep
and
because
of
this
yakov
was
not
often
asked
to
play
in
the
orchestra
he
was
only
sent
for
in
case
of
extreme
necessity
in
the
absence
of
one
of
the
jews
yakov
was
never
in
a
good
temper
as
he
was
continually
having
to
put
up
with
terrible
losses
for
instance
it
was
a
sin
to
work
on
sundays
or
saints
days
and
monday
was
an
unlucky
day
so
that
in
the
course
of
the
year
there
were
some
two
hundred
days
on
which
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
he
had
to
sit
with
his
hands
folded
and
only
think
what
a
loss
that
meant
if
anyone
in
the
town
had
a
wedding
without
music
or
if
shahkes
did
not
send
for
yakov
that
was
a
loss
too
the
superintendent
of
the
prison
was
ill
for
two
years
and
was
wasting
away
and
yakov
was
impatiently
waiting
for
him
to
die
but
the
superintendent
went
away
to
the
chief
town
of
the
province
to
be
doctored
and
there
took
and
died
there
a
loss
for
you
ten
roubles
at
least
as
there
would
have
been
an
expensive
coffin
to
make
lined
with
brocade
the
thought
of
his
losses
haunted
yakov
especially
at
night
he
laid
his
fiddle
on
the
bed
beside
him
and
when
all
sorts
of
nonsensical
ideas
came
into
his
mind
he
touched
a
string
the
fiddle
gave
out
a
sound
in
the
darkness
and
he
felt
better
on
the
sixth
of
may
of
the
previous
year
marfa
had
suddenly
been
taken
ill
the
old
woman
breathing
was
laboured
she
drank
a
great
deal
of
water
and
she
staggered
as
she
walked
yet
she
lighted
the
stove
in
the
morning
and
even
went
herself
to
get
water
towards
evening
she
lay
down
yakov
played
his
fiddle
all
day
when
it
was
quite
dark
he
took
the
book
in
which
he
used
every
day
to
put
down
his
losses
and
feeling
dull
he
began
adding
up
the
total
for
the
year
it
came
to
more
than
a
thousand
roubles
this
so
agitated
him
that
he
flung
the
reckoning
beads
down
and
trampled
them
under
his
feet
then
he
picked
up
the
reckoning
beads
and
again
spent
a
long
time
clicking
with
them
and
heaving
deep
strained
sighs
his
face
was
crimson
and
wet
with
perspiration
he
thought
that
if
he
had
put
that
lost
thousand
roubles
in
the
bank
the
interest
for
a
year
would
have
been
at
least
forty
roubles
so
that
forty
roubles
was
a
loss
too
in
fact
wherever
one
turned
there
were
losses
and
nothing
else
yakov
marfa
called
unexpectedly
i
am
dying
he
looked
round
at
his
wife
her
face
was
rosy
with
fever
unusually
bright
and
bronze
accustomed
to
seeing
her
face
always
pale
timid
and
was
bewildered
it
looked
as
if
she
really
were
dying
and
were
glad
that
she
was
going
away
for
ever
from
that
hut
from
the
coffins
and
from
yakov
and
she
gazed
at
the
ceiling
and
moved
her
lips
and
her
expression
was
one
of
happiness
as
though
she
saw
death
as
her
deliverer
and
were
whispering
with
him
it
was
daybreak
from
the
windows
one
could
see
the
flush
of
dawn
looking
at
the
old
woman
yakov
for
some
reason
reflected
that
he
had
not
once
in
his
life
been
affectionate
to
her
had
had
no
feeling
for
her
had
never
once
thought
to
buy
her
a
kerchief
or
to
bring
her
home
some
dainty
from
a
wedding
but
had
done
nothing
but
shout
at
her
scold
her
for
his
losses
shake
his
fists
at
her
it
is
true
he
had
never
actually
beaten
her
but
he
had
frightened
her
and
at
such
times
she
had
always
been
numb
with
terror
why
he
had
forbidden
her
to
drink
tea
because
they
spent
too
much
without
that
and
she
drank
only
hot
water
and
he
understood
why
she
had
such
a
strange
joyful
face
now
and
he
was
overcome
with
dread
as
soon
as
it
was
morning
he
borrowed
a
horse
from
a
neighbour
and
took
marfa
to
the
hospital
there
were
not
many
patients
there
and
so
he
had
not
long
to
wait
only
three
hours
to
his
great
satisfaction
the
patients
were
not
being
received
by
the
doctor
who
was
himself
ill
but
by
the
assistant
maxim
nikolaitch
an
old
man
of
whom
everyone
in
the
town
used
to
say
that
though
he
drank
and
was
quarrelsome
he
knew
more
than
the
doctor
i
wish
you
said
yakov
leading
his
old
woman
into
the
consulting
room
you
must
excuse
us
maxim
nikolaitch
we
are
always
troubling
you
with
our
trumpery
affairs
here
you
see
my
better
half
is
ailing
the
partner
of
my
life
as
they
say
excuse
the
expression
knitting
his
grizzled
brows
and
stroking
his
whiskers
the
assistant
began
to
examine
the
old
woman
and
she
sat
on
a
stool
a
wasted
bent
figure
with
a
sharp
nose
and
open
mouth
looking
like
a
bird
that
wants
to
drink
h
m
ah
the
assistant
said
slowly
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
influenza
and
possibly
fever
there
typhus
in
the
town
now
well
the
old
woman
has
lived
her
life
thank
god
how
old
is
she
she
be
seventy
in
another
year
maxim
nikolaitch
well
the
old
woman
has
lived
her
life
it
time
to
say
you
are
quite
right
in
what
you
say
of
course
maxim
nikolaitch
said
yakov
smiling
from
politeness
and
we
thank
you
feelingly
for
your
kindness
but
allow
me
to
say
every
insect
wants
to
live
to
be
sure
said
the
assistant
in
a
tone
which
suggested
that
it
depended
upon
him
whether
the
woman
lived
or
died
well
then
my
good
fellow
put
a
cold
compress
on
her
head
and
give
her
these
powders
twice
a
day
and
so
bonjour
from
the
expression
of
his
face
yakov
saw
that
it
was
a
bad
case
and
that
no
sort
of
powders
would
be
any
help
it
was
clear
to
him
that
marfa
would
die
very
soon
if
not
he
nudged
the
assistant
elbow
winked
at
him
and
said
in
a
low
voice
if
you
would
just
cup
her
maxim
nikolaitch
i
have
no
time
i
have
no
time
my
good
fellow
take
your
old
woman
and
go
in
god
name
goodbye
be
so
gracious
yakov
besought
him
you
know
yourself
that
if
let
us
say
it
were
her
stomach
or
her
inside
that
were
bad
then
powders
or
drops
but
you
see
she
had
got
a
chill
in
a
chill
the
first
thing
is
to
let
blood
maxim
nikolaitch
but
the
assistant
had
already
sent
for
the
next
patient
and
a
peasant
woman
came
into
the
consulting
room
with
a
boy
go
along
go
along
he
said
to
yakov
frowning
it
no
use
to
in
that
case
put
on
leeches
anyway
make
us
pray
for
you
for
ever
the
assistant
flew
into
a
rage
and
shouted
you
speak
to
me
again
you
blockhead
yakov
flew
into
a
rage
too
and
he
turned
crimson
all
over
but
he
did
not
utter
a
word
he
took
marfa
on
his
arm
and
led
her
out
of
the
room
only
when
they
were
sitting
in
the
cart
he
looked
morosely
and
ironically
at
the
hospital
and
said
a
nice
set
of
artists
they
have
settled
here
no
fear
but
he
would
have
cupped
a
rich
man
but
even
a
leech
he
grudges
to
the
poor
the
herods
when
they
got
home
and
went
into
the
hut
marfa
stood
for
ten
minutes
holding
on
to
the
stove
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
were
to
lie
down
yakov
would
talk
to
her
about
his
losses
and
scold
her
for
lying
down
and
not
wanting
to
work
yakov
looked
at
her
drearily
and
thought
that
was
john
the
divine
and
next
day
nikolay
the
and
the
day
after
that
was
sunday
and
then
monday
an
unlucky
day
for
four
days
he
would
not
be
able
to
work
and
most
likely
marfa
would
die
on
one
of
those
days
so
he
would
have
to
make
the
coffin
he
picked
up
his
iron
rule
went
up
to
the
old
woman
and
took
her
measure
then
she
lay
down
and
he
crossed
himself
and
began
making
the
coffin
when
the
coffin
was
finished
bronze
put
on
his
spectacles
and
wrote
in
his
book
marfa
ivanov
coffin
two
roubles
forty
kopecks
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
the
old
woman
lay
all
the
time
silent
with
her
eyes
closed
but
in
the
evening
when
it
got
dark
she
suddenly
called
the
old
man
do
you
remember
yakov
she
asked
looking
at
him
joyfully
do
you
remember
fifty
years
ago
god
gave
us
a
little
baby
with
flaxen
hair
we
used
always
to
be
sitting
by
the
river
then
singing
songs
under
the
willows
and
laughing
bitterly
she
added
the
baby
girl
died
yakov
racked
his
memory
but
could
not
remember
the
baby
or
the
willows
it
your
fancy
he
said
the
priest
arrived
he
administered
the
sacrament
and
extreme
unction
then
marfa
began
muttering
something
unintelligible
and
towards
morning
she
died
old
women
neighbours
washed
her
dressed
her
and
laid
her
in
the
coffin
to
avoid
paying
the
sacristan
yakov
read
the
psalms
over
the
body
himself
and
they
got
nothing
out
of
him
for
the
grave
as
the
was
a
crony
of
his
four
peasants
carried
the
coffin
to
the
graveyard
not
for
money
but
from
respect
the
coffin
was
followed
by
old
women
beggars
and
a
couple
of
crazy
saints
and
the
people
who
met
it
crossed
themselves
piously
and
yakov
was
very
much
pleased
that
it
was
so
creditable
so
decorous
and
so
cheap
and
no
offence
to
anyone
as
he
took
his
last
leave
of
marfa
he
touched
the
coffin
and
thought
a
good
piece
of
work
but
as
he
was
going
back
from
the
cemetery
he
was
overcome
by
acute
depression
he
did
feel
quite
well
his
breathing
was
laboured
and
feverish
his
legs
felt
weak
and
he
had
a
craving
for
drink
and
thoughts
of
all
sorts
forced
themselves
on
his
mind
he
remembered
again
that
all
his
life
he
had
never
felt
for
marfa
had
never
been
affectionate
to
her
the
years
they
had
lived
in
the
same
hut
had
dragged
on
a
long
long
time
but
it
had
somehow
happened
that
in
all
that
time
he
had
never
once
thought
of
her
had
paid
no
attention
to
her
as
though
she
had
been
a
cat
or
a
dog
and
yet
every
day
she
had
lighted
the
stove
had
cooked
and
baked
had
gone
for
the
water
had
chopped
the
wood
had
slept
with
him
in
the
same
bed
and
when
he
came
home
drunk
from
the
weddings
always
reverently
hung
his
fiddle
on
the
wall
and
put
him
to
bed
and
all
this
in
silence
with
a
timid
anxious
expression
rothschild
smiling
and
bowing
came
to
meet
yakov
i
was
looking
for
you
uncle
he
said
moisey
ilyitch
sends
you
his
greetings
and
bids
you
come
to
him
at
once
yakov
felt
in
no
mood
for
this
he
wanted
to
cry
leave
me
alone
he
said
and
walked
on
how
can
you
rothschild
said
fluttered
running
on
in
front
moisey
ilyitch
will
be
offended
he
bade
you
come
at
once
yakov
was
revolted
at
the
jew
gasping
for
breath
and
blinking
and
having
so
many
red
freckles
on
his
face
and
it
was
disgusting
to
look
at
his
green
coat
with
black
patches
on
it
and
all
his
fragile
refined
figure
why
are
you
pestering
me
garlic
shouted
yakov
do
persist
the
jew
got
angry
and
shouted
too
not
so
noisy
please
or
i
send
you
flying
over
the
fence
get
out
of
my
sight
roared
yakov
and
rushed
at
him
with
his
fists
one
ca
live
for
you
scabby
jews
rothschild
half
dead
with
terror
crouched
down
and
waved
his
hands
over
his
head
as
though
to
ward
off
a
blow
then
he
leapt
up
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
as
he
ran
he
gave
little
skips
and
kept
clasping
his
hands
and
yakov
could
see
how
his
long
thin
spine
wriggled
some
boys
delighted
at
the
incident
ran
after
him
shouting
jew
jew
some
dogs
joined
in
the
chase
barking
someone
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
then
gave
a
whistle
the
dogs
barked
with
even
more
noise
and
unanimity
then
a
dog
must
have
bitten
rothschild
as
a
desperate
sickly
scream
was
heard
yakov
went
for
a
walk
on
the
grazing
ground
then
wandered
on
at
random
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
while
the
street
boys
shouted
here
bronze
here
bronze
he
came
to
the
river
where
the
curlews
floated
in
the
air
uttering
shrill
cries
and
the
ducks
quacked
the
sun
was
blazing
hot
and
there
was
a
glitter
from
the
water
so
that
it
hurt
the
eyes
to
look
at
it
yakov
walked
by
a
path
along
the
bank
and
saw
a
plump
lady
come
out
of
the
and
thought
about
her
ugh
you
otter
not
far
from
the
boys
were
catching
crayfish
with
bits
of
meat
seeing
him
they
began
shouting
spitefully
bronze
bronze
and
then
he
saw
an
old
spreading
with
a
big
hollow
in
it
and
a
crow
nest
on
it
and
suddenly
there
rose
up
vividly
in
yakov
memory
a
baby
with
flaxen
hair
and
the
marfa
had
spoken
of
why
that
is
it
the
same
green
still
and
sorrowful
how
old
it
has
grown
poor
thing
he
sat
down
under
it
and
began
to
recall
the
past
on
the
other
bank
where
now
there
was
the
water
meadow
in
those
days
there
stood
a
big
birchwood
and
yonder
on
the
bare
hillside
that
could
be
seen
on
the
horizon
an
old
old
pine
forest
used
to
be
a
bluish
patch
in
the
distance
big
boats
used
to
sail
on
the
river
but
now
it
was
all
smooth
and
unruffled
and
on
the
other
bank
there
stood
now
only
one
youthful
and
slender
like
a
young
lady
and
there
was
nothing
on
the
river
but
ducks
and
geese
and
it
did
look
as
though
there
had
ever
been
boats
on
it
it
seemed
as
though
even
the
geese
were
fewer
than
of
old
yakov
shut
his
eyes
and
in
his
imagination
huge
flocks
of
white
geese
soared
meeting
one
another
he
wondered
how
it
had
happened
that
for
the
last
forty
or
fifty
years
of
his
life
he
had
never
once
been
to
the
river
or
if
he
had
been
by
it
he
had
not
paid
attention
to
it
why
it
was
a
decent
sized
river
not
a
trumpery
one
he
might
have
gone
in
for
fishing
and
sold
the
fish
to
merchants
officials
and
the
at
the
station
and
then
have
put
money
in
the
bank
he
might
have
sailed
in
a
boat
from
one
house
to
another
playing
the
fiddle
and
people
of
all
classes
would
have
paid
to
hear
him
he
might
have
tried
getting
big
boats
afloat
again
that
would
be
better
than
making
coffins
he
might
have
bred
geese
killed
them
and
sent
them
in
the
winter
to
moscow
why
the
feathers
alone
would
very
likely
mount
up
to
ten
roubles
in
the
year
but
he
had
wasted
his
time
he
had
done
nothing
of
this
what
losses
ah
what
losses
and
if
he
had
gone
in
for
all
those
things
at
once
catching
fish
and
playing
the
fiddle
and
running
boats
and
killing
geese
what
a
fortune
he
would
have
made
but
nothing
of
this
had
happened
even
in
his
dreams
life
had
passed
uselessly
without
any
pleasure
had
been
wasted
for
nothing
not
even
a
pinch
of
snuff
there
was
nothing
left
in
front
and
if
one
looked
back
there
was
nothing
there
but
losses
and
such
terrible
ones
it
made
one
cold
all
over
and
why
was
it
a
man
could
not
live
so
as
to
avoid
these
losses
and
misfortunes
one
wondered
why
they
had
cut
down
the
birch
copse
and
the
pine
forest
why
was
he
walking
with
no
reason
on
the
grazing
ground
why
do
people
always
do
what
is
needful
why
had
yakov
all
his
life
scolded
bellowed
shaken
his
fists
his
wife
and
one
might
ask
what
necessity
was
there
for
him
to
frighten
and
insult
the
jew
that
day
why
did
people
in
general
hinder
each
other
from
living
what
losses
were
due
to
it
what
terrible
losses
if
it
were
not
for
hatred
and
malice
people
would
get
immense
benefit
from
one
another
in
the
evening
and
the
night
he
had
visions
of
the
baby
of
the
willow
of
fish
of
slaughtered
geese
and
marfa
looking
in
profile
like
a
bird
that
wants
to
drink
and
the
pale
pitiful
face
of
rothschild
and
faces
moved
down
from
all
sides
and
muttered
of
losses
he
tossed
from
side
to
side
and
got
out
of
bed
five
times
to
play
the
fiddle
in
the
morning
he
got
up
with
an
effort
and
went
to
the
hospital
the
same
maxim
nikolaitch
told
him
to
put
a
cold
compress
on
his
head
and
gave
him
some
powders
and
from
his
tone
and
expression
of
face
yakov
realized
that
it
was
a
bad
case
and
that
no
powders
would
be
any
use
as
he
went
home
afterwards
he
reflected
that
death
would
be
nothing
but
a
benefit
he
would
not
have
to
eat
or
drink
or
pay
taxes
or
offend
people
and
as
a
man
lies
in
his
grave
not
for
one
year
but
for
hundreds
and
thousands
if
one
reckoned
it
up
the
gain
would
be
enormous
a
man
life
meant
loss
death
meant
gain
this
reflection
was
of
course
a
just
one
but
yet
it
was
bitter
and
mortifying
why
was
the
order
of
the
world
so
strange
that
life
which
is
given
to
man
only
once
passes
away
without
benefit
he
was
not
sorry
to
die
but
at
home
as
soon
as
he
saw
his
fiddle
it
sent
a
pang
to
his
heart
and
he
felt
sorry
he
could
not
take
the
fiddle
with
him
to
the
grave
and
now
it
would
be
left
forlorn
and
the
same
thing
would
happen
to
it
as
to
the
birch
copse
and
the
pine
forest
everything
in
this
world
was
wasted
and
would
be
wasted
yakov
went
out
of
the
hut
and
sat
in
the
doorway
pressing
the
fiddle
to
his
bosom
thinking
of
his
wasted
profitless
life
he
began
to
play
he
did
not
know
what
but
it
was
plaintive
and
touching
and
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
and
the
harder
he
thought
the
more
mournfully
the
fiddle
wailed
the
latch
clicked
once
and
again
and
rothschild
appeared
at
the
gate
he
walked
across
half
the
yard
boldly
but
seeing
yakov
he
stopped
short
and
seemed
to
shrink
together
and
probably
from
terror
began
making
signs
with
his
hands
as
though
he
wanted
to
show
on
his
fingers
what
it
was
come
along
it
all
right
said
yakov
in
a
friendly
tone
and
he
beckoned
him
to
come
up
come
along
looking
at
him
mistrustfully
and
apprehensively
rothschild
began
to
advance
and
stopped
seven
feet
off
be
so
good
as
not
to
beat
me
he
said
ducking
moisey
ilyitch
has
sent
me
again
be
afraid
he
said
to
yakov
again
and
tell
him
he
said
ca
get
on
without
him
there
is
a
wedding
on
wednesday
ye
shapovalov
is
marrying
his
daughter
to
a
good
man
and
it
will
be
a
grand
wedding
added
the
jew
screwing
up
one
eye
i
ca
come
said
yakov
breathing
hard
i
ill
brother
and
he
began
playing
again
and
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
on
to
the
fiddle
rothschild
listened
attentively
standing
sideways
to
him
and
folding
his
arms
on
his
chest
the
scared
and
perplexed
expression
on
his
face
little
by
little
changed
to
a
look
of
woe
and
suffering
he
rolled
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
experiencing
an
agonizing
ecstasy
and
articulated
vachhh
and
tears
slowly
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
trickled
on
his
greenish
coat
and
yakov
lay
in
bed
all
the
rest
of
the
day
grieving
in
the
evening
when
the
priest
confessing
him
asked
did
he
remember
any
special
sin
he
had
committed
straining
his
failing
memory
he
thought
again
of
marfa
unhappy
face
and
the
despairing
shriek
of
the
jew
when
the
dog
bit
him
and
said
hardly
audibly
give
the
fiddle
to
rothschild
very
well
answered
the
priest
and
now
everyone
in
the
town
asks
where
rothschild
got
such
a
fine
fiddle
did
he
buy
it
or
steal
it
or
perhaps
it
had
come
to
him
as
a
pledge
he
gave
up
the
flute
long
ago
and
now
plays
nothing
but
the
fiddle
as
plaintive
sounds
flow
now
from
his
bow
as
came
once
from
his
flute
but
when
he
tries
to
repeat
what
yakov
played
sitting
in
the
doorway
the
effect
is
something
so
sad
and
sorrowful
that
his
audience
weep
and
he
himself
rolls
his
eyes
and
articulates
vachhh
and
this
new
air
was
so
much
liked
in
the
town
that
the
merchants
and
officials
used
to
be
continually
sending
for
rothschild
and
making
him
play
it
over
and
over
again
a
dozen
times
ivan
matveyitch
between
five
and
six
in
the
evening
a
fairly
man
of
learning
we
will
call
him
simply
the
man
of
learning
is
sitting
in
his
study
nervously
biting
his
nails
it
positively
revolting
he
says
continually
looking
at
his
watch
it
shows
the
utmost
disrespect
for
another
man
time
and
work
in
england
such
a
person
would
not
earn
a
farthing
he
would
die
of
hunger
you
wait
a
minute
when
you
do
come
and
feeling
a
craving
to
vent
his
wrath
and
impatience
upon
someone
the
man
of
learning
goes
to
the
door
leading
to
his
wife
room
and
knocks
listen
katya
he
says
in
an
indignant
voice
if
you
see
pyotr
danilitch
tell
him
that
decent
people
do
do
such
things
abominable
he
recommends
a
secretary
and
does
not
know
the
sort
of
man
he
is
recommending
the
wretched
boy
is
two
or
three
hours
late
with
unfailing
regularity
every
day
do
you
call
that
a
secretary
those
two
or
three
hours
are
more
precious
to
me
than
two
or
three
years
to
other
people
when
he
does
come
i
will
swear
at
him
like
a
dog
and
wo
pay
him
and
will
kick
him
out
no
use
standing
on
ceremony
with
people
like
that
you
say
that
every
day
and
yet
he
goes
on
coming
and
coming
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
have
lost
enough
through
him
you
must
excuse
me
but
i
shall
swear
at
him
like
a
cabman
at
last
a
ring
is
heard
the
man
of
learning
makes
a
grave
face
drawing
himself
up
and
throwing
back
his
head
he
goes
into
the
entry
there
his
amanuensis
ivan
matveyitch
a
young
man
of
eighteen
with
a
face
oval
as
an
egg
and
no
moustache
wearing
a
shabby
mangy
overcoat
and
no
goloshes
is
already
standing
by
the
hatstand
he
is
in
breathless
haste
and
scrupulously
wipes
his
huge
clumsy
boots
on
the
doormat
trying
as
he
does
so
to
conceal
from
the
maidservant
a
hole
in
his
boot
through
which
a
white
sock
is
peeping
seeing
the
man
of
learning
he
smiles
with
that
broad
prolonged
somewhat
foolish
smile
which
is
seen
only
on
the
faces
of
children
or
very
people
ah
good
evening
he
says
holding
out
a
big
wet
hand
has
your
sore
throat
gone
ivan
matveyitch
says
the
man
of
learning
in
a
shaking
voice
stepping
back
and
clasping
his
hands
together
ivan
matveyitch
then
he
dashes
up
to
the
amanuensis
clutches
him
by
the
shoulders
and
begins
feebly
shaking
him
what
a
way
to
treat
me
he
says
with
despair
in
his
voice
you
dreadful
horrid
fellow
what
a
way
to
treat
me
are
you
laughing
at
me
are
you
jeering
at
me
eh
judging
from
the
smile
which
still
lingered
on
his
face
ivan
matveyitch
had
expected
a
very
different
reception
and
so
seeing
the
man
of
learning
countenance
eloquent
of
indignation
his
oval
face
grows
longer
than
ever
and
he
opens
his
mouth
in
amazement
what
is
what
is
it
he
asks
and
you
ask
that
the
man
of
learning
clasps
his
hands
you
know
how
precious
time
is
to
me
and
you
are
so
late
you
are
two
hours
late

you
no
fear
of
god

have
come
straight
from
home

ivan
matveyitch
untying
his
scarf
irresolutely
i
have
been
at
my
aunt
party
and
my
aunt
lives
five
miles
away
if
i
had
come
straight
from
home
then
it
would
have
been
a
different
thing
come
reflect
ivan
matveyitch
is
there
any
logic
in
your
conduct
here
you
have
work
to
do
work
at
a
fixed
time
and
you
go
flying
off
after
parties
and
aunts
but
do
make
haste
and
undo
your
wretched
scarf
it
beyond
endurance
really
the
man
of
learning
dashes
up
to
the
amanuensis
again
and
helps
him
to
disentangle
his
scarf
you
are
done
up
like
a
peasant
woman
come
along
please
make
haste
blowing
his
nose
in
a
dirty
handkerchief
and
pulling
down
his
grey
reefer
jacket
ivan
matveyitch
goes
through
the
hall
and
the
to
the
study
there
a
place
and
paper
and
even
cigarettes
had
been
put
ready
for
him
long
ago
sit
down
sit
down
the
man
of
learning
urges
him
on
rubbing
his
hands
impatiently
you
are
an
unsufferable
person
you
know
the
work
has
to
be
finished
by
a
certain
time
and
then
you
are
so
late
one
is
forced
to
scold
you
come
write
where
did
we
stop
ivan
matveyitch
smooths
his
bristling
cropped
hair
and
takes
up
his
pen
the
man
of
learning
walks
up
and
down
the
room
concentrates
himself
and
begins
to
dictate
the
fact
is
comma
that
so
to
speak
fundamental
forms
have
you
written
it
forms
are
conditioned
entirely
by
the
essential
nature
of
those
principles
comma
which
find
in
them
their
expression
and
can
only
be
embodied
in
them
new
line
there
a
stop
there
of
course
more
independence
is
found
is
found
by
the
forms
which
have
not
so
much
a
political
comma
as
a
social
character
the
boys
have
a
different
uniform
now
a
grey
one
said
ivan
matveyitch
when
i
was
at
school
it
was
better
they
used
to
wear
regular
uniforms
oh
dear
write
please
says
the
man
of
learning
wrathfully
character
have
you
written
it
speaking
of
the
forms
relating
to
the
organization
of
administrative
functions
and
not
to
the
regulation
of
the
life
of
the
people
comma
it
can
not
be
said
that
they
are
marked
by
the
nationalism
of
their
forms
the
last
three
words
in
inverted
commas
aie
aie
tut
tut
so
what
did
you
want
to
say
about
the
high
school
that
they
used
to
wear
a
different
uniform
in
my
time
aha
indeed
is
it
long
since
you
left
the
high
school
but
i
told
you
that
yesterday
it
is
three
years
since
i
left
school
i
left
in
the
fourth
class
and
why
did
you
give
up
high
school
asks
the
man
of
learning
looking
at
ivan
matveyitch
writing
oh
through
family
circumstances
must
i
speak
to
you
again
ivan
matveyitch
when
will
you
get
over
your
habit
of
dragging
out
the
lines
there
ought
not
to
be
less
than
forty
letters
in
a
line
what
do
you
suppose
i
do
it
on
purpose
says
ivan
matveyitch
offended
there
are
more
than
forty
letters
in
some
of
the
other
lines
you
count
them
and
if
you
think
i
do
put
enough
in
the
line
you
can
take
something
off
my
pay
oh
dear
that
not
the
point
you
have
no
delicacy
really
at
the
least
thing
you
drag
in
money
the
great
thing
is
to
be
exact
ivan
matveyitch
to
be
exact
is
the
great
thing
you
ought
to
train
yourself
to
be
exact
the
maidservant
brings
in
a
tray
with
two
glasses
of
tea
on
it
and
a
basket
of
rusks
ivan
matveyitch
takes
his
glass
awkwardly
with
both
hands
and
at
once
begins
drinking
it
the
tea
is
too
hot
to
avoid
burning
his
mouth
ivan
matveyitch
tries
to
take
a
tiny
sip
he
eats
one
rusk
then
a
second
then
a
third
and
looking
sideways
with
embarrassment
at
the
man
of
learning
timidly
stretches
after
a
fourth
the
noise
he
makes
in
swallowing
the
relish
with
which
he
smacks
his
lips
and
the
expression
of
hungry
greed
in
his
raised
eyebrows
irritate
the
man
of
learning
make
haste
and
finish
time
is
precious
you
dictate
i
can
drink
and
write
at
the
same
time
i
must
confess
i
was
hungry
i
should
think
so
after
your
walk
yes
and
what
wretched
weather
in
our
parts
there
is
a
scent
of
spring
by
now
there
are
puddles
everywhere
the
snow
is
melting
you
are
a
southerner
i
suppose
from
the
don
region
it
quite
spring
with
us
by
march
here
it
is
frosty
everyone
in
a
fur
coat
but
there
you
can
see
the
grass
it
dry
everywhere
and
one
can
even
catch
tarantulas
and
what
do
you
catch
tarantulas
for
oh
to
pass
the
time
says
ivan
matveyitch
and
he
sighs
it
fun
catching
them
you
fix
a
bit
of
pitch
on
a
thread
let
it
down
into
their
hole
and
begin
hitting
the
tarantula
on
the
back
with
the
pitch
and
the
brute
gets
cross
catches
hold
of
the
pitch
with
his
claws
and
gets
stuck
and
what
we
used
to
do
with
them
we
used
to
put
a
basinful
of
them
together
and
drop
a
bihorka
in
with
them
what
is
a
bihorka
that
another
spider
very
much
the
same
as
a
tarantula
in
a
fight
one
of
them
can
kill
a
hundred
tarantulas
h
but
we
must
write
where
did
we
stop
the
man
of
learning
dictates
another
twenty
lines
then
sits
plunged
in
meditation
ivan
matveyitch
waiting
while
the
other
cogitates
sits
and
craning
his
neck
puts
the
collar
of
his
shirt
to
rights
his
tie
will
not
set
properly
the
stud
has
come
out
and
the
collar
keeps
coming
apart
h
says
the
man
of
learning
well
have
you
found
a
job
yet
ivan
matveyitch
no
and
how
is
one
to
find
one
i
am
thinking
you
know
of
volunteering
for
the
army
but
my
father
advises
my
going
into
a
chemist
h
but
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
go
into
the
university
the
examination
is
difficult
but
with
patience
and
hard
work
you
could
get
through
study
read
more
do
you
read
much
not
much
i
must
own
says
ivan
matveyitch
lighting
a
cigarette
have
you
read
turgenev
and
gogol
gogol
h
gogol
no
i
have
read
him
ivan
matveyitch
are
you
ashamed
aie
aie
you
are
such
a
nice
fellow
so
much
that
is
original
in
you
you
have
even
read
gogol
you
must
read
him
i
will
give
you
his
works
it
essential
to
read
him
we
shall
quarrel
if
you
do
again
a
silence
follows
the
man
of
learning
meditates
half
reclining
on
a
soft
lounge
and
ivan
matveyitch
leaving
his
collar
in
peace
concentrates
his
whole
attention
on
his
boots
he
has
not
till
then
noticed
that
two
big
puddles
have
been
made
by
the
snow
melting
off
his
boots
on
the
floor
he
is
ashamed
i
ca
get
on
mutters
the
man
of
learning
i
suppose
you
are
fond
of
catching
birds
too
ivan
matveyitch
that
in
autumn
i
do
catch
them
here
but
there
at
home
i
always
did
to
be
sure
very
good
but
we
must
write
though
the
man
of
learning
gets
up
resolutely
and
begins
dictating
but
after
ten
lines
sits
down
on
the
lounge
again
no
perhaps
we
had
better
put
it
off
till
morning
he
says
come
morning
only
come
early
at
nine
god
preserve
you
from
being
late
ivan
matveyitch
lays
down
his
pen
gets
up
from
the
table
and
sits
in
another
chair
five
minutes
pass
in
silence
and
he
begins
to
feel
it
is
time
for
him
to
go
that
he
is
in
the
way
but
in
the
man
of
learning
study
it
is
so
snug
and
light
and
warm
and
the
impression
of
the
nice
rusks
and
sweet
tea
is
still
so
fresh
that
there
is
a
pang
at
his
heart
at
the
mere
thought
of
home
at
home
there
is
poverty
hunger
cold
his
grumbling
father
scoldings
and
here
it
is
so
quiet
and
unruffled
and
interest
even
is
taken
in
his
tarantulas
and
birds
the
man
of
learning
looks
at
his
watch
and
takes
up
a
book
so
you
will
give
me
gogol
says
ivan
matveyitch
getting
up
yes
yes
but
why
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
my
dear
boy
sit
down
and
tell
me
something
ivan
matveyitch
sits
down
and
smiles
broadly
almost
every
evening
he
sits
in
this
study
and
always
feels
something
extraordinarily
soft
attracting
him
as
it
were
akin
in
the
voice
and
the
glance
of
the
man
of
learning
there
are
moments
when
he
even
fancies
that
the
man
of
learning
is
becoming
attached
to
him
used
to
him
and
that
if
he
scolds
him
for
being
late
it
simply
because
he
misses
his
chatter
about
tarantulas
and
how
they
catch
goldfinches
on
the
don
zinotchka
the
party
of
sportsmen
spent
the
night
in
a
peasant
hut
on
some
newly
mown
hay
the
moon
peeped
in
at
the
window
from
the
street
came
the
mournful
wheezing
of
a
concertina
from
the
hay
came
a
sickly
sweet
faintly
troubling
scent
the
sportsmen
talked
about
dogs
about
women
about
first
love
and
about
snipe
after
all
the
ladies
of
their
acquaintance
had
been
picked
to
pieces
and
hundreds
of
stories
had
been
told
the
stoutest
of
the
sportsmen
who
looked
in
the
darkness
like
a
haycock
and
who
talked
in
the
mellow
bass
of
a
staff
officer
gave
a
loud
yawn
and
said
it
is
nothing
much
to
be
loved
the
ladies
are
created
for
the
purpose
of
loving
us
men
but
tell
me
has
any
one
of
you
fellows
been
hated
passionately
furiously
hated
has
any
one
of
you
watched
the
ecstasies
of
hatred
eh
no
answer
followed
has
no
one
gentlemen
asked
the
staff
officer
bass
voice
but
i
now
have
been
hated
hated
by
a
pretty
girl
and
have
been
able
to
study
the
symptoms
of
first
hatred
directed
against
myself
it
was
the
first
because
it
was
something
exactly
the
converse
of
first
love
what
i
am
going
to
tell
however
happened
when
i
knew
nothing
about
love
or
hate
i
was
eight
at
the
time
but
that
made
no
difference
in
this
case
it
was
not
but
that
mattered
well
i
beg
your
attention
one
fine
summer
evening
just
before
sunset
i
was
sitting
in
the
nursery
doing
my
lesson
with
my
governess
zinotchka
a
very
charming
and
poetical
creature
who
had
left
boarding
school
not
long
before
zinotchka
looked
towards
the
window
and
said
we
breathe
in
oxygen
now
tell
me
petya
what
do
we
breathe
out
acid
gas
i
answered
looking
towards
the
same
window
assented
zinotchka
on
the
contrary
breathe
in
carbonic
acid
gas
and
breathe
out
oxygen
carbonic
acid
gas
is
contained
in
seltzer
water
and
in
the
fumes
from
the
samovar
it
is
a
very
noxious
gas
near
naples
there
is
the
cave
of
dogs
which
contains
carbonic
acid
gas
a
dog
dropped
into
it
is
suffocated
and
dies
this
luckless
cave
of
dogs
near
naples
is
a
chemical
marvel
beyond
which
no
governess
ventures
to
go
zinotchka
always
hotly
maintained
the
usefulness
of
natural
science
but
i
doubt
if
she
knew
any
chemistry
beyond
this
cave
well
she
told
me
to
repeat
it
i
repeated
it
she
asked
me
what
was
meant
by
the
horizon
i
answered
and
meantime
while
we
were
ruminating
over
the
horizon
and
the
cave
in
the
yard
below
my
father
was
just
getting
ready
to
go
shooting
the
dogs
yapped
the
trace
horses
shifted
from
one
leg
to
another
impatiently
and
coquetted
with
the
coachman
the
footman
packed
the
waggonette
with
parcels
and
all
sorts
of
things
beside
the
waggonette
stood
a
brake
in
which
my
mother
and
sisters
were
sitting
to
drive
to
a
party
at
the
ivanetskys
no
one
was
left
in
the
house
but
zinotchka
me
and
my
eldest
brother
a
student
who
had
toothache
you
can
imagine
my
envy
and
my
boredom
what
do
we
breathe
in
asked
zinotchka
looking
at
the
window
and
the
horizon
is
the
name
given
to
the
place
where
it
seems
to
us
as
though
the
earth
meets
the
sky
then
the
waggonette
drove
off
and
after
it
the
brake
i
saw
zinotchka
take
a
note
out
of
her
pocket
crumple
it
up
convulsively
and
press
it
to
her
temple
then
she
flushed
crimson
and
looked
at
her
watch
remember
she
said
near
naples
is
the
cave
of
dogs
she
glanced
at
her
watch
again
and
went
on
the
sky
seems
to
us
to
meet
the
earth
the
poor
girl
in
violent
agitation
walked
about
the
room
and
once
more
glanced
at
her
watch
there
was
another
before
the
end
of
our
lesson
arithmetic
she
said
breathing
hard
and
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
with
a
trembling
hand
you
work
out
problem
and
i
will
be
back
directly
she
went
out
i
heard
her
scurry
down
the
stairs
and
then
i
saw
her
dart
across
the
yard
in
her
blue
dress
and
vanish
through
the
garden
gate
the
rapidity
of
her
movements
the
flush
on
her
cheeks
and
her
excitement
aroused
my
curiosity
where
had
she
run
and
what
for
being
intelligent
beyond
my
years
i
soon
put
two
and
two
together
and
understood
it
all
she
had
run
into
the
garden
taking
advantage
of
the
absence
of
my
stern
parents
to
steal
in
among
the
raspberry
bushes
or
to
pick
herself
some
cherries
if
that
were
so
dash
it
all
i
would
go
and
have
some
cherries
too
i
threw
aside
the
and
ran
into
the
garden
i
ran
to
the
cherry
orchard
but
she
was
not
there
passing
by
the
raspberries
the
gooseberries
and
the
watchman
shanty
she
crossed
the
kitchen
garden
and
reached
the
pond
pale
and
starting
at
every
sound
i
stole
after
her
and
what
i
saw
my
friends
was
this
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
between
the
thick
stumps
of
two
old
willows
stood
my
elder
brother
sasha
one
could
not
see
from
his
face
that
he
had
toothache
he
looked
towards
zinotchka
as
she
approached
him
and
his
whole
figure
was
lighted
up
by
an
expression
of
happiness
as
though
by
sunshine
and
zinotchka
as
though
she
were
being
driven
into
the
cave
of
dogs
and
were
being
forced
to
breathe
carbonic
acid
gas
walked
towards
him
scarcely
able
to
move
one
leg
before
the
other
breathing
hard
with
her
head
thrown
back
to
judge
from
appearances
she
was
going
to
a
rendezous
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
but
at
last
she
reached
him
for
half
a
minute
they
gazed
at
each
other
in
silence
as
though
they
could
not
believe
their
eyes
thereupon
some
force
seemed
to
shove
zinotchka
she
laid
her
hands
on
sasha
shoulders
and
let
her
head
droop
upon
his
waistcoat
sasha
laughed
muttered
something
incoherent
and
with
the
clumsiness
of
a
man
head
over
ears
in
love
laid
both
hands
on
zinotchka
face
and
the
weather
gentlemen
was
exquisite
the
hill
behind
which
the
sun
was
setting
the
two
willows
the
green
bank
the
sky
all
together
with
sasha
and
zinotchka
were
reflected
in
the
pond
perfect
stillness
you
can
imagine
it
millions
of
butterflies
with
long
whiskers
gleamed
golden
above
the
reeds
beyond
the
garden
they
were
driving
the
cattle
in
fact
it
was
a
perfect
picture
of
all
i
had
seen
the
only
thing
i
understood
was
that
sasha
was
kissing
zinotchka
that
was
improper
if
heard
of
it
they
would
both
catch
it
feeling
for
some
reason
ashamed
i
went
back
to
the
nursery
not
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
rendezvous
there
i
sat
over
the
pondered
and
reflected
a
triumphant
smile
strayed
upon
my
countenance
on
one
side
it
was
agreeable
to
be
the
possessor
of
another
person
secret
on
the
other
it
was
also
very
agreeable
that
such
authorities
as
sasha
and
zinotchka
might
at
any
moment
be
convicted
by
me
of
ignorance
of
the
social
proprieties
now
they
were
in
my
power
and
their
peace
was
entirely
dependent
on
my
magnanimity
i
let
them
know
when
i
went
to
bed
zinotchka
came
into
the
nursery
as
usual
to
find
out
whether
i
had
dropped
asleep
without
undressing
and
whether
i
had
said
my
prayers
i
looked
at
her
pretty
happy
face
and
grinned
i
was
bursting
with
my
secret
and
itching
to
let
it
out
i
had
to
drop
a
hint
and
enjoy
the
effect
know
i
said
grinning
y
do
you
know
y
i
saw
you
near
the
willows
kissing
sasha
i
followed
you
and
saw
it
all
zinotchka
started
flushed
all
over
and
overwhelmed
by
she
sank
down
on
the
chair
on
which
stood
a
glass
of
water
and
a
candlestick
saw
you
kissing
i
repeated
sniggering
and
enjoying
her
confusion
i
tell
mamma
cowardly
zinotchka
gazed
at
me
intently
and
convincing
herself
that
i
really
did
know
all
about
it
clutched
my
hand
in
despair
and
muttered
in
a
trembling
whisper
it
is
low
i
beg
of
you
for
god
sake
be
a
man
do
tell
anyone
decent
people
do
spy
it
low
i
entreat
you
the
poor
girl
was
terribly
afraid
of
my
mother
a
stern
and
virtuous
lady
that
was
one
thing
and
the
second
was
that
my
grinning
countenance
could
not
but
outrage
her
first
love
so
pure
and
poetical
and
you
can
imagine
the
state
of
her
heart
thanks
to
me
she
did
not
sleep
a
wink
all
night
and
in
the
morning
she
appeared
at
breakfast
with
blue
rings
round
her
eyes
when
i
met
sasha
after
breakfast
i
could
not
refrain
from
grinning
and
boasting
know
i
saw
you
yesterday
kissing
mademoiselle
zina
sasha
looked
at
me
and
said
are
a
fool
he
was
not
so
cowardly
as
zinotchka
and
so
my
effect
did
not
come
off
that
provoked
me
to
further
efforts
if
sasha
was
not
frightened
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
believe
that
i
had
seen
and
knew
all
about
it
wait
a
bit
i
would
show
him
at
our
lessons
before
dinner
zinotchka
did
not
look
at
me
and
her
voice
faltered
instead
of
trying
to
scare
me
she
tried
to
propitiate
me
in
every
way
giving
me
full
marks
and
not
complaining
to
my
father
of
my
naughtiness
being
intelligent
beyond
my
years
i
exploited
her
secret
i
did
not
learn
my
lessons
walked
into
the
schoolroom
on
my
head
and
said
all
sorts
of
rude
things
in
fact
if
i
had
remained
in
that
vein
till
i
should
have
become
a
famous
blackmailer
well
a
week
passed
another
person
secret
irritated
and
fretted
me
like
a
splinter
in
my
soul
i
longed
at
all
costs
to
blurt
it
out
and
gloat
over
the
effect
and
one
day
at
dinner
when
we
had
a
lot
of
visitors
i
gave
a
stupid
snigger
looked
fiendishly
at
zinotchka
and
said
know
gy
y
i
saw
do
you
know
asked
my
mother
i
looked
still
more
fiendishly
at
zinotchka
and
sasha
you
ought
to
have
seen
how
the
girl
flushed
up
and
how
furious
sasha
eyes
were
i
bit
my
tongue
and
did
not
go
on
zinotchka
gradually
turned
pale
clenched
her
teeth
and
ate
no
more
dinner
at
our
evening
lessons
that
day
i
noticed
a
striking
change
in
zinotchka
face
it
looked
sterner
colder
as
it
were
more
like
marble
while
her
eyes
gazed
strangely
straight
into
my
face
and
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
have
never
seen
such
terrible
annihilating
eyes
even
in
hounds
when
they
overtake
the
wolf
i
understood
their
expression
perfectly
when
in
the
middle
of
a
lesson
she
suddenly
clenched
her
teeth
and
hissed
through
them
hate
you
oh
you
vile
loathsome
creature
if
you
knew
how
i
hate
you
how
i
detest
your
cropped
head
your
vulgar
prominent
ears
but
at
once
she
took
fright
and
said
am
not
speaking
to
you
i
am
repeating
a
part
out
of
a
play
then
my
friends
at
night
i
saw
her
come
to
my
bedside
and
gaze
a
long
time
into
my
face
she
hated
me
passionately
and
could
not
exist
away
from
me
the
contemplation
of
my
hated
pug
of
a
face
had
become
a
necessity
to
her
i
remember
a
lovely
summer
evening
with
the
scent
of
hay
perfect
stillness
and
so
on
the
moon
was
shining
i
was
walking
up
and
down
the
avenue
thinking
of
cherry
jam
suddenly
zinotchka
looking
pale
and
lovely
came
up
to
me
she
caught
hold
of
my
hand
and
breathlessly
began
expressing
herself
how
i
hate
you
i
wish
no
one
harm
as
i
do
you
let
me
tell
you
that
i
want
you
to
understand
that
you
understand
moonlight
her
pale
face
breathless
with
passion
the
stillness
little
pig
as
i
was
i
actually
enjoyed
it
i
listened
to
her
looked
at
her
eyes
at
first
i
liked
it
and
enjoyed
the
novelty
then
i
was
suddenly
seized
with
terror
i
gave
a
scream
and
ran
into
the
house
at
breakneck
speed
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
complain
to
and
i
did
complain
mentioning
incidentally
how
sasha
had
kissed
zinotchka
i
was
stupid
and
did
not
know
what
would
follow
or
i
should
have
kept
the
secret
to
myself
after
hearing
my
story
flushed
with
indignation
and
said
is
not
your
business
to
speak
about
that
you
are
still
very
young
but
what
an
example
for
children
my
was
not
only
virtuous
but
diplomatic
to
avoid
a
scandal
she
did
not
get
rid
of
zinotchka
at
once
but
set
to
work
gradually
systematically
to
pave
the
way
for
her
departure
as
one
does
with
but
intolerable
people
i
remember
that
when
zinotchka
did
leave
us
the
last
glance
she
cast
at
the
house
was
directed
at
the
window
at
which
i
was
sitting
and
i
assure
you
i
remember
that
glance
to
this
day
zinotchka
soon
afterwards
became
my
brother
wife
she
is
the
zinaida
nikolaevna
whom
you
know
the
next
time
i
met
her
i
was
already
an
ensign
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
she
could
not
recognize
the
hated
petya
in
the
ensign
with
his
moustache
but
still
she
did
not
treat
me
quite
like
a
relation
and
even
now
in
spite
of
my
baldness
meek
corpulence
and
unassuming
air
she
still
looks
askance
at
me
and
feels
put
out
when
i
go
to
see
my
brother
hatred
it
seems
can
no
more
be
forgotten
than
love
tchoo
i
hear
the
cock
crowing
milord
lie
down
bad
weather
big
raindrops
were
pattering
on
the
dark
windows
it
was
one
of
those
disgusting
summer
holiday
rains
which
when
they
have
begun
last
a
long
time
for
weeks
till
the
frozen
holiday
maker
grows
used
to
it
and
sinks
into
complete
apathy
it
was
cold
there
was
a
feeling
of
raw
unpleasant
dampness
the
of
a
lawyer
called
kvashin
and
his
wife
nadyezhda
filippovna
dressed
in
waterproofs
and
shawls
were
sitting
over
the
dinner
table
in
the
it
was
written
on
the
countenance
of
the
elder
lady
that
she
was
thank
god
and
in
good
health
that
she
had
married
her
only
daughter
to
a
good
man
and
now
could
play
her
game
of
patience
with
an
easy
conscience
her
daughter
a
rather
short
plump
fair
young
woman
of
twenty
with
a
gentle
anæmic
face
was
reading
a
book
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
judging
from
her
eyes
she
was
not
so
much
reading
as
thinking
her
own
thoughts
which
were
not
in
the
book
neither
of
them
spoke
there
was
the
sound
of
the
pattering
rain
and
from
the
kitchen
they
could
hear
the
prolonged
yawns
of
the
cook
kvashin
himself
was
not
at
home
on
rainy
days
he
did
not
come
to
the
summer
villa
but
stayed
in
town
damp
rainy
weather
affected
his
bronchitis
and
prevented
him
from
working
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
sight
of
the
grey
sky
and
the
tears
of
rain
on
the
windows
deprived
one
of
energy
and
induced
the
spleen
in
the
town
where
there
was
greater
comfort
bad
weather
was
scarcely
noticed
after
two
games
of
patience
the
old
lady
shuffled
the
cards
and
took
a
glance
at
her
daughter
i
have
been
trying
with
the
cards
whether
it
will
be
fine
and
whether
our
alexey
stepanovitch
will
come
she
said
it
is
five
days
since
he
was
here
the
weather
is
a
chastisement
from
god
nadyezhda
filippovna
looked
indifferently
at
her
mother
got
up
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
the
barometer
was
rising
yesterday
she
said
doubtfully
but
they
say
it
is
falling
again
the
old
lady
laid
out
the
cards
in
three
long
rows
and
shook
her
head
do
you
miss
him
she
asked
glancing
at
her
daughter
of
course
i
see
you
do
i
should
think
so
he
has
been
here
for
five
days
in
may
the
utmost
was
two
or
at
most
three
days
and
now
it
is
serious
five
days
i
am
not
his
wife
and
yet
i
miss
him
and
yesterday
when
i
heard
the
barometer
was
rising
i
ordered
them
to
kill
a
chicken
and
prepare
a
carp
for
alexey
stepanovitch
he
likes
them
your
poor
father
could
bear
fish
but
he
likes
it
he
always
eats
it
with
relish
my
heart
aches
for
him
said
the
daughter
we
are
dull
but
it
is
duller
still
for
him
you
know
mamma
i
should
think
so
in
the
day
in
and
day
out
and
in
the
empty
flat
at
night
alone
like
an
owl
and
what
is
so
awful
mamma
he
is
alone
there
without
servants
there
is
no
one
to
set
the
samovar
or
bring
him
water
why
he
engage
a
valet
for
the
summer
months
and
what
use
is
the
summer
villa
at
all
if
he
does
not
care
for
it
i
told
him
there
was
no
need
to
have
it
but
no
is
for
the
sake
of
your
health
he
said
and
what
is
wrong
with
my
health
it
makes
me
ill
that
he
should
have
to
put
up
with
so
much
on
my
account
looking
over
her
mother
shoulder
the
daughter
noticed
a
mistake
in
the
patience
bent
down
to
the
table
and
began
correcting
it
a
silence
followed
both
looked
at
the
cards
and
imagined
how
their
alexey
stepanovitch
utterly
forlorn
was
sitting
now
in
the
town
in
his
gloomy
empty
study
and
working
hungry
exhausted
yearning
for
his
family
do
you
know
what
mamma
said
nadyezhda
filippovna
suddenly
and
her
eyes
began
to
shine
if
the
weather
is
the
same
go
by
the
first
train
and
see
him
in
town
anyway
i
shall
find
out
how
he
is
have
a
look
at
him
and
pour
out
his
tea
and
both
of
them
began
to
wonder
how
it
was
that
this
idea
so
simple
and
easy
to
carry
out
had
not
occurred
to
them
before
it
was
only
half
an
hour
in
the
train
to
the
town
and
then
twenty
minutes
in
a
cab
they
said
a
little
more
and
went
off
to
bed
in
the
same
room
feeling
more
contented
lord
forgive
us
sinners
sighed
the
old
lady
when
the
clock
in
the
hall
struck
two
there
is
no
sleeping
you
are
not
asleep
mamma
the
daughter
asked
in
a
whisper
i
keep
thinking
of
alyosha
i
only
hope
he
wo
ruin
his
health
in
town
goodness
knows
where
he
dines
and
lunches
in
restaurants
and
taverns
i
have
thought
of
that
myself
sighed
the
old
lady
the
heavenly
mother
save
and
preserve
him
but
the
rain
the
rain
in
the
morning
the
rain
was
not
pattering
on
the
panes
but
the
sky
was
still
grey
the
trees
stood
looking
mournful
and
at
every
gust
of
wind
they
scattered
drops
the
footprints
on
the
muddy
path
the
ditches
and
the
ruts
were
full
of
water
nadyezhda
filippovna
made
up
her
mind
to
go
give
him
my
love
said
the
old
lady
wrapping
her
daughter
up
tell
him
not
to
think
too
much
about
his
cases
and
he
must
rest
let
him
wrap
his
throat
up
when
he
goes
out
the
weather
god
help
us
and
take
him
the
chicken
food
from
home
even
if
cold
is
better
than
at
a
restaurant
the
daughter
went
away
saying
that
she
would
come
back
by
an
evening
train
or
else
next
morning
but
she
came
back
long
before
when
the
old
lady
was
sitting
on
her
trunk
in
her
bedroom
and
drowsily
thinking
what
to
cook
for
her
supper
going
into
the
room
her
daughter
pale
and
agitated
sank
on
the
bed
without
uttering
a
word
or
taking
off
her
hat
and
pressed
her
head
into
the
pillow
but
what
is
the
matter
said
the
old
lady
in
surprise
why
back
so
soon
where
is
alexey
stepanovitch
nadyezhda
filippovna
raised
her
head
and
gazed
at
her
mother
with
dry
imploring
eyes
he
is
deceiving
us
mamma
she
said
what
are
you
saying
christ
be
with
you
cried
the
old
lady
in
alarm
and
her
cap
slipped
off
her
head
who
is
going
to
deceive
us
lord
have
mercy
on
us
he
is
deceiving
us
mamma
repeated
her
daughter
and
her
chin
began
to
quiver
how
do
you
know
cried
the
old
lady
turning
pale
our
flat
is
locked
up
the
porter
tells
me
that
alyosha
has
not
been
home
once
for
these
five
days
he
is
not
living
at
home
he
is
not
at
home
not
at
home
she
waved
her
hands
and
burst
into
loud
weeping
uttering
nothing
but
not
at
home
not
at
home
she
began
to
be
hysterical
what
the
meaning
of
it
muttered
the
old
woman
in
horror
why
he
wrote
the
day
before
yesterday
that
he
never
leaves
the
flat
where
is
he
sleeping
holy
saints
nadyezhda
filippovna
felt
so
faint
that
she
could
not
take
off
her
hat
she
looked
about
her
blankly
as
though
she
had
been
drugged
and
convulsively
clutched
at
her
mother
arms
what
a
person
to
trust
a
porter
said
the
old
lady
fussing
round
her
daughter
and
crying
what
a
jealous
girl
you
are
he
is
not
going
to
deceive
you
and
how
dare
he
we
are
not
just
anybody
though
we
are
of
the
merchant
class
yet
he
has
no
right
for
you
are
his
lawful
wife
we
can
take
proceedings
i
gave
twenty
thousand
roubles
with
you
you
did
not
want
for
a
dowry
and
the
old
lady
herself
sobbed
and
gesticulated
and
she
felt
faint
too
and
lay
down
on
her
trunk
neither
of
them
noticed
that
patches
of
blue
had
made
their
appearance
in
the
sky
that
the
clouds
were
more
transparent
that
the
first
sunbeam
was
cautiously
gliding
over
the
wet
grass
in
the
garden
that
with
renewed
gaiety
the
sparrows
were
hopping
about
the
puddles
which
reflected
the
racing
clouds
towards
evening
kvashin
arrived
before
leaving
town
he
had
gone
to
his
flat
and
had
learned
from
the
porter
that
his
wife
had
come
in
his
absence
here
i
am
he
said
gaily
coming
into
his
room
and
pretending
not
to
notice
their
stern
and
faces
here
i
am
it
five
days
since
we
have
seen
each
other
he
rapidly
kissed
his
wife
hand
and
his
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
delighted
at
having
finished
a
difficult
task
he
lolled
in
an
ough
he
said
puffing
out
all
the
air
from
his
lungs
here
i
have
been
worried
to
death
i
have
scarcely
sat
down
for
almost
five
days
now
i
have
been
as
it
were
bivouacking
i
have
been
to
the
flat
once
would
you
believe
it
i
have
been
busy
the
whole
time
with
the
meeting
of
shipunov
and
ivantchikov
creditors
i
had
to
work
in
galdeyev
office
at
the
shop
i
had
nothing
to

or

and
slept
on
a
bench
i
was
chilled
through
i
had
a
free
minute
i
had
even
time
to
go
to
the
flat
that
how
i
came
not
to
be
at
home
nadyusha
and
kvashin
holding
his
sides
as
though
his
back
were
aching
glanced
stealthily
at
his
wife
and
to
see
the
effect
of
his
lie
or
as
he
called
it
diplomacy
the
and
wife
were
looking
at
each
other
in
joyful
astonishment
as
though
beyond
all
hope
and
expectation
they
had
found
something
precious
which
they
had
lost
their
faces
beamed
their
eyes
glowed
my
dear
man
cried
the
old
lady
jumping
up
why

i
sitting
here
tea

at
once
perhaps
you
are
hungry
of
course
he

hungry
cried
his
wife
pulling
off
her
head
a
bandage
soaked
in
vinegar
mamma
bring
the
wine
and
the
savouries
natalya
lay
the
table
oh
my
goodness
nothing
is
ready
and
both
of
them
frightened
happy
and
bustling
ran
about
the
room
the
old
lady
could
not
look
without
laughing
at
her
daughter
who
had
slandered
an
innocent
man
and
the
daughter
felt
ashamed
the
table
was
soon
laid
kvashin
who
smelt
of
madeira
and
liqueurs
and
who
could
scarcely
breathe
from
repletion
complained
of
being
hungry
forced
himself
to
munch
and
kept
on
talking
of
the
meeting
of
shipunov
and
ivantchikov
creditors
while
his
wife
and
could
not
take
their
eyes
off
his
face
and
both
thought
how
clever
and
kind
he
is
how
handsome
all
serene
thought
kvashin
as
he
lay
down
on
the
feather
bed
though
they
are
regular
tradesmen
wives
though
they
are
philistines
yet
they
have
a
charm
of
their
own
and
one
can
spend
a
day
or
two
of
the
week
here
with
enjoyment
he
wrapped
himself
up
got
warm
and
as
he
dozed
off
he
said
to
himself
all
serene
a
gentleman
friend
the
charming
vanda
or
as
she
was
described
in
her
passport
the
honourable
citizen
nastasya
kanavkin
found
herself
on
leaving
the
hospital
in
a
position
she
had
never
been
in
before
without
a
home
to
go
to
or
a
farthing
in
her
pocket
what
was
she
to
do
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
visit
a
and
pawn
her
turquoise
ring
her
one
piece
of
jewellery
they
gave
her
a
rouble
for
the
ring
but
what
can
you
get
for
a
rouble
you
ca
buy
for
that
sum
a
fashionable
short
jacket
nor
a
big
hat
nor
a
pair
of
bronze
shoes
and
without
those
things
she
had
a
feeling
of
being
as
it
were
undressed
she
felt
as
though
the
very
horses
and
dogs
were
staring
and
laughing
at
the
plainness
of
her
dress
and
clothes
were
all
she
thought
about
the
question
what
she
should
eat
and
where
she
should
sleep
did
not
trouble
her
in
the
least
if
only
i
could
meet
a
gentleman
friend
she
thought
to
herself
i
could
get
some
money
there
is
one
who
would
refuse
me
i
know
but
no
gentleman
she
knew
came
her
way
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
meet
them
in
the
evening
at
the
renaissance
but
they
let
her
in
at
the
renaissance
in
that
shabby
dress
and
with
no
hat
what
was
she
to
do
after
long
hesitation
when
she
was
sick
of
walking
and
sitting
and
thinking
vanda
made
up
her
mind
to
fall
back
on
her
last
resource
to
go
straight
to
the
lodgings
of
some
gentleman
friend
and
ask
for
money
she
pondered
which
to
go
to
misha
is
out
of
the
question
he
a
married
man
the
old
chap
with
the
red
hair
will
be
at
his
office
at
this
time
vanda
remembered
a
dentist
called
finkel
a
converted
jew
who
six
months
ago
had
given
her
a
bracelet
and
on
whose
head
she
had
once
emptied
a
glass
of
beer
at
the
supper
at
the
german
club
she
was
awfully
pleased
at
the
thought
of
finkel
he
be
sure
to
give
it
me
if
only
i
find
him
at
home
she
thought
as
she
walked
in
his
direction
if
he
does
i
smash
all
the
lamps
in
the
house
before
she
reached
the
dentist
door
she
thought
out
her
plan
of
action
she
would
run
laughing
up
the
stairs
dash
into
the
room
and
demand
roubles
but
as
she
touched
the
bell
this
plan
seemed
to
vanish
from
her
mind
of
itself
vanda
began
suddenly
feeling
frightened
and
nervous
which
was
not
at
all
her
way
she
was
bold
and
saucy
enough
at
drinking
parties
but
now
dressed
in
everyday
clothes
feeling
herself
in
the
position
of
an
ordinary
person
asking
a
favour
who
might
be
refused
admittance
she
felt
suddenly
timid
and
humiliated
she
was
ashamed
and
frightened
perhaps
he
has
forgotten
me
by
now
she
thought
hardly
daring
to
pull
the
bell
and
how
can
i
go
up
to
him
in
such
a
dress
looking
like
a
beggar
or
some
working
girl
and
she
rang
the
bell
irresolutely
she
heard
steps
coming
it
was
the
porter
is
the
doctor
at
home
she
asked
she
would
have
been
glad
now
if
the
porter
had
said
no
but
the
latter
instead
of
answering
ushered
her
into
the
hall
and
helped
her
off
with
her
coat
the
staircase
impressed
her
as
luxurious
and
magnificent
but
of
all
its
splendours
what
caught
her
eye
most
was
an
immense
in
which
she
saw
a
ragged
figure
without
a
fashionable
jacket
without
a
big
hat
and
without
bronze
shoes
and
it
seemed
strange
to
vanda
that
now
that
she
was
humbly
dressed
and
looked
like
a
laundress
or
sewing
girl
she
felt
ashamed
and
no
trace
of
her
usual
boldness
and
sauciness
remained
and
in
her
own
mind
she
no
longer
thought
of
herself
as
vanda
but
as
the
nastasya
kanavkin
she
used
to
be
in
the
old
days
walk
in
please
said
a
maidservant
showing
her
into
the
the
doctor
will
be
here
in
a
minute
sit
down
vanda
sank
into
a
soft
i
ask
him
to
lend
it
me
she
thought
that
will
be
quite
proper
for
after
all
i
do
know
him
if
only
that
servant
would
go
i
do
like
to
ask
before
her
what
does
she
want
to
stand
there
for
five
minutes
later
the
door
opened
and
finkel
came
in
he
was
a
tall
dark
jew
with
fat
cheeks
and
bulging
eyes
his
cheeks
his
eyes
his
chest
his
body
all
of
him
was
so
well
fed
so
loathsome
and
repellent
at
the
renaissance
and
the
german
club
he
had
usually
been
rather
tipsy
and
would
spend
his
money
freely
on
women
and
be
very
and
patient
with
their
pranks
when
vanda
for
instance
poured
the
beer
over
his
head
he
simply
smiled
and
shook
his
finger
at
her
now
he
had
a
cross
sleepy
expression
and
looked
solemn
and
frigid
like
a
police
captain
and
he
kept
chewing
something
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
asked
without
looking
at
vanda
vanda
looked
at
the
serious
countenance
of
the
maid
and
the
smug
figure
of
finkel
who
apparently
did
not
recognize
her
and
she
turned
red
what
can
i
do
for
you
repeated
the
dentist
a
little
irritably
i
got
toothache
murmured
vanda
aha
which
is
the
tooth
where
vanda
remembered
she
had
a
hole
in
one
of
her
teeth
at
the
bottom
on
the
right
she
said
hm
open
your
mouth
finkel
frowned
and
holding
his
breath
began
examining
the
tooth
does
it
hurt
he
asked
digging
into
it
with
a
steel
instrument
yes
vanda
replied
untruthfully
shall
i
remind
him
she
was
wondering
he
would
be
sure
to
remember
me
but
that
servant
why
will
she
stand
there
finkel
suddenly
snorted
like
a
right
into
her
mouth
and
said
i
do
advise
you
to
have
it
stopped
that
tooth
will
never
be
worth
keeping
anyhow
after
probing
the
tooth
a
little
more
and
soiling
vanda
lips
and
gums
with
his
fingers
he
held
his
breath
again
and
put
something
cold
into
her
mouth
vanda
suddenly
felt
a
sharp
pain
cried
out
and
clutched
at
finkel
hand
it
all
right
it
all
right
he
muttered
do
you
be
frightened
that
tooth
would
have
been
no
use
to
you
anyway
you
must
be
brave
and
his
fingers
smeared
with
blood
held
up
the
tooth
to
her
eyes
while
the
maid
approached
and
put
a
basin
to
her
mouth
you
wash
out
your
mouth
with
cold
water
when
you
get
home
and
that
will
stop
the
bleeding
said
finkel
he
stood
before
her
with
the
air
of
a
man
expecting
her
to
go
waiting
to
be
left
in
peace
she
said
turning
towards
the
door
hm
and
how
about
my
fee
enquired
finkel
in
a
jesting
tone
oh
yes
vanda
remembered
blushing
and
she
handed
the
jew
the
rouble
that
had
been
given
her
for
her
ring
when
she
got
out
into
the
street
she
felt
more
overwhelmed
with
shame
than
before
but
now
it
was
not
her
poverty
she
was
ashamed
of
she
was
unconscious
now
of
not
having
a
big
hat
and
a
fashionable
jacket
she
walked
along
the
street
spitting
blood
and
brooding
on
her
life
her
ugly
wretched
life
and
the
insults
she
had
endured
and
would
have
to
endure
and
next
week
and
all
her
life
up
to
the
very
day
of
her
death
oh
how
awful
it
is
my
god
how
fearful
next
day
however
she
was
back
at
the
renaissance
and
dancing
there
she
had
on
an
enormous
new
red
hat
a
new
fashionable
jacket
and
bronze
shoes
and
she
was
taken
out
to
supper
by
a
young
merchant
up
from
kazan
a
trivial
incident
it
was
a
sunny
august
midday
as
in
company
with
a
russian
prince
who
had
come
down
in
the
world
i
drove
into
the
immense
shabelsky
where
we
were
intending
to
look
for
woodcocks
in
virtue
of
the
part
he
plays
in
this
story
my
poor
prince
deserves
a
detailed
description
he
was
a
tall
dark
man
still
youngish
though
already
somewhat
battered
by
life
with
long
moustaches
like
a
police
captain
with
prominent
black
eyes
and
with
the
manners
of
a
retired
army
man
he
was
a
man
of
oriental
type
not
very
intelligent
but
straightforward
and
honest
not
a
bully
not
a
fop
and
not
a
rake
virtues
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
general
public
are
equivalent
to
a
certificate
of
being
a
nonentity
and
a
poor
creature
people
generally
did
not
like
him
he
was
never
spoken
of
in
the
district
except
as
the
illustrious
duffer
i
personally
found
the
poor
prince
extremely
nice
with
his
misfortunes
and
failures
which
made
up
indeed
his
whole
life
first
of
all
he
was
poor
he
did
not
play
cards
did
not
drink
had
no
occupation
did
not
poke
his
nose
into
anything
and
maintained
a
perpetual
silence
but
yet
he
had
somehow
succeeded
in
getting
through
thirty
to
forty
thousand
roubles
left
him
at
his
father
death
god
only
knows
what
had
become
of
the
money
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
owing
to
lack
of
supervision
a
great
deal
was
stolen
by
stewards
bailiffs
and
even
footmen
a
great
deal
went
on
lending
money
giving
bail
and
standing
security
there
were
few
landowners
in
the
district
who
did
not
owe
him
money
he
gave
to
all
who
asked
and
not
so
much
from
good
nature
or
confidence
in
people
as
from
exaggerated
gentlemanliness
as
though
he
would
say
take
it
and
feel
how
il
i
am
by
the
time
i
made
his
acquaintance
he
had
got
into
debt
himself
had
learned
what
it
was
like
to
have
a
second
mortgage
on
his
land
and
had
sunk
so
deeply
into
difficulties
that
there
was
no
chance
of
his
ever
getting
out
of
them
again
there
were
days
when
he
had
no
dinner
and
went
about
with
an
empty
but
he
was
always
seen
clean
and
fashionably
dressed
and
always
smelt
strongly
of
the
prince
second
misfortune
was
his
absolute
solitariness
he
was
not
married
he
had
no
friends
nor
relations
his
silent
and
reserved
character
and
his
il
deportment
which
became
the
more
conspicuous
the
more
anxious
he
was
to
conceal
his
poverty
prevented
him
from
becoming
intimate
with
people
for
love
affairs
he
was
too
heavy
spiritless
and
cold
and
so
rarely
got
on
with
women
when
we
reached
the
forest
this
prince
and
i
got
out
of
the
chaise
and
walked
along
a
narrow
woodland
path
which
was
hidden
among
huge
ferns
but
before
we
had
gone
a
hundred
paces
a
tall
lank
figure
with
a
long
oval
face
wearing
a
shabby
reefer
jacket
a
straw
hat
and
patent
leather
boots
rose
up
from
behind
a
young
some
three
feet
high
as
though
he
had
sprung
out
of
the
ground
the
stranger
held
in
one
hand
a
basket
of
mushrooms
with
the
other
he
playfully
fingered
a
cheap
on
his
waistcoat
on
seeing
us
he
was
taken
aback
smoothed
his
waistcoat
coughed
politely
and
gave
an
agreeable
smile
as
though
he
were
delighted
to
see
such
nice
people
as
us
then
to
our
complete
surprise
he
came
up
to
us
scraping
with
his
long
feet
on
the
grass
bending
his
whole
person
and
still
smiling
agreeably
lifted
his
hat
and
pronounced
in
a
sugary
voice
with
the
intonations
of
a
whining
dog
aie
aie
gentlemen
painful
as
it
is
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
shooting
is
forbidden
in
this
wood
pardon
me
for
venturing
to
disturb
you
though
unacquainted
but
allow
me
to
present
myself
i
am
grontovsky
the
head
clerk
on
madame
kandurin
estate
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
but
why
ca
we
shoot
such
is
the
wish
of
the
owner
of
this
forest
the
prince
and
i
exchanged
glances
a
moment
passed
in
silence
the
prince
stood
looking
pensively
at
a
big
fly
agaric
at
his
feet
which
he
had
crushed
with
his
stick
grontovsky
went
on
smiling
agreeably
his
whole
face
was
twitching
exuding
honey
and
even
the
on
his
waistcoat
seemed
to
be
smiling
and
trying
to
impress
us
all
with
its
refinement
a
shade
of
embarrassment
passed
over
us
like
an
angel
passing
all
three
of
us
felt
awkward
nonsense
i
said
only
last
week
i
was
shooting
here
very
possible
grontovsky
sniggered
through
his
teeth
as
a
matter
of
fact
everyone
shoots
here
regardless
of
the
prohibition
but
once
i
have
met
you
it
is
my
duty
my
sacred
duty
to
warn
you
i
am
a
man
in
a
dependent
position
if
the
forest
were
mine
on
the
word
of
honour
of
a
grontovsky
i
should
not
oppose
your
agreeable
pleasure
but
whose
fault
is
it
that
i
am
in
a
dependent
position
the
lanky
individual
sighed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
began
arguing
getting
hot
and
protesting
but
the
more
loudly
and
impressively
i
spoke
the
more
mawkish
and
sugary
grontovsky
face
became
evidently
the
consciousness
of
a
certain
power
over
us
afforded
him
the
greatest
gratification
he
was
enjoying
his
condescending
tone
his
politeness
his
manners
and
with
peculiar
relish
pronounced
his
sonorous
surname
of
which
he
was
probably
very
fond
standing
before
us
he
felt
more
than
at
ease
but
judging
from
the
confused
sideway
glances
he
cast
from
time
to
time
at
his
basket
only
one
thing
was
spoiling
his
satisfaction
the
mushrooms
womanish
peasantish
prose
derogatory
to
his
dignity
we
ca
go
back
i
said
we
have
come
over
ten
miles
what
to
be
done
sighed
grontovsky
if
you
had
come
not
ten
but
a
hundred
thousand
miles
if
the
king
even
had
come
from
america
or
from
some
other
distant
land
even
then
i
should
think
it
my
duty
sacred
so
to
say
obligation
does
the
forest
belong
to
nadyezhda
lvovna
asked
the
prince
yes
nadyezhda
lvovna
is
she
at
home
now
yes
i
tell
you
what
you
go
to
her
it
is
not
more
than
half
a
mile
from
here
if
she
gives
you
a
note
then
i
say
ha
ha
he
he
by
all
means
i
agreed
it
much
nearer
than
to
go
back
you
go
to
her
sergey
ivanitch
i
said
addressing
the
prince
you
know
her
the
prince
who
had
been
gazing
the
whole
time
at
the
crushed
agaric
raised
his
eyes
to
me
thought
a
minute
and
said
i
used
to
know
her
at
one
time
but
it
rather
awkward
for
me
to
go
to
her
besides
i
am
in
shabby
clothes
you
go
you
do
know
her
it
more
suitable
for
you
to
go
i
agreed
we
got
into
our
chaise
and
followed
by
smiles
drove
along
the
edge
of
the
forest
to
the
manor
house
i
was
not
acquainted
with
nadyezhda
lvovna
kandurin
née
shabelsky
i
had
never
seen
her
at
close
quarters
and
knew
her
only
by
hearsay
i
knew
that
she
was
incredibly
wealthy
richer
than
anyone
else
in
the
province
after
the
death
of
her
father
shabelsky
who
was
a
landowner
with
no
other
children
she
was
left
with
several
estates
a
stud
farm
and
a
lot
of
money
i
had
heard
that
though
she
was
only
or
she
was
ugly
uninteresting
and
as
insignificant
as
anybody
and
was
only
distinguished
from
the
ordinary
ladies
of
the
district
by
her
immense
wealth
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
wealth
is
felt
and
that
the
rich
must
have
special
feelings
unknown
to
the
poor
often
as
i
passed
by
nadyezhda
lvovna
big
fruit
garden
in
which
stood
the
large
heavy
house
with
its
windows
always
curtained
i
thought
what
is
she
thinking
at
this
moment
is
there
happiness
behind
those
blinds
and
so
on
once
i
saw
her
from
a
distance
in
a
fine
light
cabriolet
driving
a
handsome
white
horse
and
sinful
man
that
i
am
i
not
only
envied
her
but
even
thought
that
in
her
poses
in
her
movements
there
was
something
special
not
to
be
found
in
people
who
are
not
rich
just
as
persons
of
a
servile
nature
succeed
in
discovering
good
family
at
the
first
glance
in
people
of
the
most
ordinary
exterior
if
they
are
a
little
more
distinguished
than
themselves
nadyezhda
lvovna
inner
life
was
only
known
to
me
by
scandal
it
was
said
in
the
district
that
five
or
six
years
ago
before
she
was
married
during
her
father
lifetime
she
had
been
passionately
in
love
with
prince
sergey
ivanitch
who
was
now
beside
me
in
the
chaise
the
prince
had
been
fond
of
visiting
her
father
and
used
to
spend
whole
days
in
his
billiard
room
where
he
played
pyramids
indefatigably
till
his
arms
and
legs
ached
six
months
before
the
old
man
death
he
had
suddenly
given
up
visiting
the
shabelskys
the
gossip
of
the
district
having
no
positive
facts
to
go
upon
explained
this
abrupt
change
in
their
relations
in
various
ways
some
said
that
the
prince
having
observed
the
plain
feeling
for
him
and
being
unable
to
reciprocate
it
considered
it
the
duty
of
a
gentleman
to
cut
short
his
visits
others
maintained
that
old
shabelsky
had
discovered
why
his
daughter
was
pining
away
and
had
proposed
to
the
prince
that
he
should
marry
her
the
prince
imagining
in
his
way
that
they
were
trying
to
buy
him
together
with
his
title
was
indignant
said
foolish
things
and
quarrelled
with
them
what
was
true
and
what
was
false
in
this
nonsense
was
difficult
to
say
but
that
there
was
a
portion
of
truth
in
it
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
the
prince
always
avoided
conversation
about
nadyezhda
lvovna
i
knew
that
soon
after
her
father
death
nadyezhda
lvovna
had
married
one
kandurin
a
bachelor
of
law
not
wealthy
but
adroit
who
had
come
on
a
visit
to
the
neighbourhood
she
married
him
not
from
love
but
because
she
was
touched
by
the
love
of
the
legal
gentleman
who
so
it
was
said
had
cleverly
played
the
swain
at
the
time
i
am
describing
kandurin
was
for
some
reason
living
in
cairo
and
writing
thence
to
his
friend
the
marshal
of
the
district
notes
of
travel
while
she
sat
languishing
behind
lowered
blinds
surrounded
by
idle
parasites
and
whiled
away
her
dreary
days
in
petty
philanthropy
on
the
way
to
the
house
the
prince
fell
to
talking
it
three
days
since
i
have
been
at
home
he
said
in
a
half
whisper
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
driver
i
am
not
a
child
nor
a
silly
woman
and
i
have
no
prejudices
but
i
ca
stand
the
bailiffs
when
i
see
a
bailiff
in
my
house
i
turn
pale
and
tremble
and
even
have
a
twitching
in
the
calves
of
my
legs
do
you
know
rogozhin
refused
to
honour
my
note
the
prince
did
not
as
a
rule
like
to
complain
of
his
straitened
circumstances
where
poverty
was
concerned
he
was
reserved
and
exceedingly
proud
and
sensitive
and
so
this
announcement
surprised
me
he
stared
a
long
time
at
the
yellow
clearing
warmed
by
the
sun
watched
a
long
string
of
cranes
float
in
the
azure
sky
and
turned
facing
me
and
by
the
sixth
of
september
i
must
have
the
money
ready
for
the
bank
the
interest
for
my
estate
he
said
aloud
by
now
regardless
of
the
coachman
and
where
am
i
to
get
it
altogether
old
man
i
am
in
a
tight
fix
an
awfully
tight
fix
the
prince
examined
the
cock
of
his
gun
blew
on
it
for
some
reason
and
began
looking
for
the
cranes
which
by
now
were
out
of
sight
sergey
ivanitch
i
asked
after
a
minute
silence
imagine
if
they
sell
your
shatilovka
what
will
you
do
i
i
do
know
shatilovka
ca
be
saved
that
clear
as
daylight
but
i
can
not
imagine
such
a
calamity
i
ca
imagine
myself
without
my
daily
bread
secure
what
can
i
do
i
have
had
hardly
any
education
i
have
not
tried
working
yet
for
government
service
it
is
late
to
begin
besides
where
could
i
serve
where
could
i
be
of
use
admitting
that
no
great
cleverness
is
needed
for
serving
in
our
zemstvo
for
example
yet
i
suffer
from
the
devil
knows
what
a
sort
of
faintheartedness
i
have
a
of
pluck
if
i
went
into
the
service
i
should
always
feel
i
was
not
in
my
right
place
i
am
not
an
idealist
i
am
not
a
utopian
i
have
any
special
principles
but
am
simply
i
suppose
stupid
and
thoroughly
incompetent
a
neurotic
and
a
coward
altogether
not
like
other
people
all
other
people
are
like
other
people
only
i
seem
to
be
something
a
poor
thing
i
met
naryagin
last
wednesday
you
know
him
drunken
slovenly
does
pay
his
debts
stupid
the
prince
frowned
and
tossed
his
head
a
horrible
person
he
said
to
me
staggering
being
balloted
for
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
of
course
they
wo
elect
him
but
you
see
he
believes
he
is
fit
to
be
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
considers
that
position
within
his
capacity
he
has
boldness
and
i
went
to
see
our
investigating
magistrate
too
the
man
gets
two
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
a
month
and
does
scarcely
anything
all
he
can
do
is
to
stride
backwards
and
forwards
for
days
together
in
nothing
but
his
underclothes
but
ask
him
he
is
convinced
he
is
doing
his
work
and
honourably
performing
his
duty
i
could
go
on
like
that
i
should
be
ashamed
to
look
the
clerk
in
the
face
at
that
moment
grontovsky
on
a
chestnut
horse
galloped
by
us
with
a
flourish
on
his
left
arm
the
basket
bobbed
up
and
down
with
the
mushrooms
dancing
in
it
as
he
passed
us
he
grinned
and
waved
his
hand
as
though
we
were
old
friends
blockhead
the
prince
filtered
through
his
teeth
looking
after
him
it
wonderful
how
disgusting
it
sometimes
is
to
see
satisfied
faces
a
stupid
animal
feeling
due
to
hunger
i
expect
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
about
going
into
the
service
i
should
be
ashamed
to
take
the
salary
and
yet
to
tell
the
truth
it
is
stupid
if
one
looks
at
it
from
a
broader
point
of
view
more
seriously
i
am
eating
what
is
mine
now
am
i
not
but
why
am
i
not
ashamed
of
that
it
is
a
case
of
habit
i
suppose
and
not
being
able
to
realize
one
true
position
but
that
position
is
most
likely
awful
i
looked
at
him
wondering
if
the
prince
were
showing
off
but
his
face
was
mild
and
his
eyes
were
mournfully
following
the
movements
of
the
chestnut
horse
racing
away
as
though
his
happiness
were
racing
away
with
it
apparently
he
was
in
that
mood
of
irritation
and
sadness
when
women
weep
quietly
for
no
reason
and
men
feel
a
craving
to
complain
of
themselves
of
life
of
god
when
i
got
out
of
the
chaise
at
the
gates
of
the
house
the
prince
said
to
me
a
man
once
said
wanting
to
annoy
me
that
i
have
the
face
of
a
cardsharper
i
have
noticed
that
cardsharpers
are
usually
dark
do
you
know
it
seems
that
if
i
really
had
been
born
a
cardsharper
i
should
have
remained
a
decent
person
to
the
day
of
my
death
for
i
should
never
have
had
the
boldness
to
do
wrong
i
tell
you
frankly
i
have
had
the
chance
once
in
my
life
of
getting
rich
if
i
had
told
a
lie
a
lie
to
myself
and
one
woman
and
one
other
person
whom
i
know
would
have
forgiven
me
for
lying
i
should
have
put
into
my
pocket
a
million
but
i
could
not
i
had
the
pluck
from
the
gates
we
had
to
go
to
the
house
through
the
copse
by
a
long
road
level
as
a
ruler
and
planted
on
each
side
with
thick
lopped
lilacs
the
house
looked
somewhat
heavy
tasteless
like
a
façade
on
the
stage
it
rose
clumsily
out
of
a
mass
of
greenery
and
caught
the
eye
like
a
great
stone
thrown
on
the
velvety
turf
at
the
chief
entrance
i
was
met
by
a
fat
old
footman
in
a
green
coat
and
big
spectacles
without
making
any
announcement
only
looking
contemptuously
at
my
dusty
figure
he
showed
me
in
as
i
mounted
the
soft
carpeted
stairs
there
was
for
some
reason
a
strong
smell
of
at
the
top
i
was
enveloped
in
an
atmosphere
found
only
in
museums
in
signorial
mansions
and
merchant
houses
it
seemed
like
the
smell
of
something
long
past
which
had
once
lived
and
died
and
had
left
its
soul
in
the
rooms
i
passed
through
three
or
four
rooms
on
my
way
from
the
entry
to
the
i
remember
bright
yellow
shining
floors
lustres
wrapped
in
stiff
muslin
narrow
striped
rugs
which
stretched
not
straight
from
door
to
door
as
they
usually
do
but
along
the
walls
so
that
not
venturing
to
touch
the
bright
floor
with
my
muddy
boots
i
had
to
describe
a
rectangle
in
each
room
in
the
where
the
footman
left
me
stood
ancestral
furniture
in
white
covers
shrouded
in
twilight
it
looked
surly
and
elderly
and
as
though
out
of
respect
for
its
repose
not
a
sound
was
audible
even
the
clock
was
silent
it
seemed
as
though
the
princess
tarakanov
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
golden
frame
and
the
water
and
the
rats
were
still
and
motionless
through
magic
the
daylight
afraid
of
disturbing
the
universal
tranquillity
scarcely
pierced
through
the
lowered
blinds
and
lay
on
the
soft
rugs
in
pale
slumbering
streaks
three
minutes
passed
and
a
big
elderly
woman
in
black
with
her
cheek
bandaged
up
walked
noiselessly
into
the
she
bowed
to
me
and
pulled
up
the
blinds
at
once
enveloped
in
the
bright
sunlight
the
rats
and
water
in
the
picture
came
to
life
and
movement
princess
tarakanov
was
awakened
and
the
old
chairs
frowned
gloomily
her
honour
will
be
here
in
a
minute
sir
sighed
the
old
lady
frowning
too
a
few
more
minutes
of
waiting
and
i
saw
nadyezhda
lvovna
what
struck
me
first
of
all
was
that
she
certainly
was
ugly
short
scraggy
and
her
thick
chestnut
hair
was
magnificent
her
face
pure
and
with
a
look
of
culture
in
it
was
aglow
with
youth
there
was
a
clear
and
intelligent
expression
in
her
eyes
but
the
whole
charm
of
her
head
was
lost
through
the
thickness
of
her
lips
and
the
facial
angle
i
mentioned
my
name
and
announced
the
object
of
my
visit
i
really
do
know
what
i
am
to
say
she
said
in
hesitation
dropping
her
eyes
and
smiling
i
do
like
to
refuse
and
at
the
same
time
do
please
i
begged
nadyezhda
lvovna
looked
at
me
and
laughed
i
laughed
too
she
was
probably
amused
by
what
grontovsky
had
so
enjoyed
that
is
the
right
of
giving
or
withholding
permission
my
visit
suddenly
struck
me
as
queer
and
strange
i
do
like
to
break
the
rules
said
madame
kandurin
shooting
has
been
forbidden
on
our
estate
for
the
last
six
years
no
she
shook
her
head
resolutely
excuse
me
i
must
refuse
you
if
i
allow
you
i
must
allow
others
i
do
like
unfairness
either
let
all
or
no
one
i
am
sorry
i
sighed
it
all
the
sadder
because
we
have
come
more
than
ten
miles
i
am
not
alone
i
added
prince
sergey
ivanitch
is
with
me
i
uttered
the
prince
name
with
no
not
prompted
by
any
special
motive
or
aim
i
simply
blurted
it
out
without
thinking
in
the
simplicity
of
my
heart
hearing
the
familiar
name
madame
kandurin
started
and
bent
a
prolonged
gaze
upon
me
i
noticed
her
nose
turn
pale
that
makes
no
difference
she
said
dropping
her
eyes
as
i
talked
to
her
i
stood
at
the
window
that
looked
out
on
the
shrubbery
i
could
see
the
whole
shrubbery
with
the
avenues
and
the
ponds
and
the
road
by
which
i
had
come
at
the
end
of
the
road
beyond
the
gates
the
back
of
our
chaise
made
a
dark
patch
near
the
gate
with
his
back
to
the
house
the
prince
was
standing
with
his
legs
apart
talking
to
the
lanky
grontovsky
madame
kandurin
had
been
standing
all
the
time
at
the
other
window
she
looked
from
time
to
time
towards
the
shrubbery
and
from
the
moment
i
mentioned
the
prince
name
she
did
not
turn
away
from
the
window
excuse
me
she
said
screwing
up
her
eyes
as
she
looked
towards
the
road
and
the
gate
but
it
would
be
unfair
to
allow
you
only
to
shoot
and
besides
what
pleasure
is
there
in
shooting
birds
what
it
for
are
they
in
your
way
a
solitary
life
immured
within
four
walls
with
its
indoor
twilight
and
heavy
smell
of
decaying
furniture
disposes
people
to
sentimentality
madame
kandurin
idea
did
her
credit
but
i
could
not
resist
saying
if
one
takes
that
line
one
ought
to
go
barefoot
boots
are
made
out
of
the
leather
of
slaughtered
animals
one
must
distinguish
between
a
necessity
and
a
caprice
madame
kandurin
answered
in
a
toneless
voice
she
had
by
now
recognized
the
prince
and
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
his
figure
it
is
hard
to
describe
the
delight
and
the
suffering
with
which
her
ugly
face
was
radiant
her
eyes
were
smiling
and
shining
her
lips
were
quivering
and
laughing
while
her
face
craned
closer
to
the
panes
keeping
hold
of
a
with
both
hands
with
bated
breath
and
with
one
foot
slightly
lifted
she
reminded
me
of
a
dog
pointing
and
waiting
with
passionate
impatience
for
fetch
it
i
looked
at
her
and
at
the
prince
who
could
not
tell
a
lie
once
in
his
life
and
i
felt
angry
and
bitter
against
truth
and
falsehood
which
play
such
an
elemental
part
in
the
personal
happiness
of
men
the
prince
started
suddenly
took
aim
and
fired
a
hawk
flying
over
him
fluttered
its
wings
and
flew
like
an
arrow
far
away
he
aimed
too
high
i
said
and
so
nadyezhda
lvovna
i
sighed
moving
away
from
the
window
you
will
not
permit
madame
kandurin
was
silent
i
have
the
honour
to
take
my
leave
i
said
and
i
beg
you
to
forgive
my
disturbing
you
madame
kandurin
would
have
turned
facing
me
and
had
already
moved
through
a
quarter
of
the
angle
when
she
suddenly
hid
her
face
behind
the
hangings
as
though
she
felt
tears
in
her
eyes
that
she
wanted
to
conceal
forgive
me
she
said
softly
i
bowed
to
her
back
and
strode
away
across
the
bright
yellow
floors
no
longer
keeping
to
the
carpet
i
was
glad
to
get
away
from
this
little
domain
of
gilded
boredom
and
sadness
and
i
hastened
as
though
anxious
to
shake
off
a
heavy
fantastic
dream
with
its
twilight
its
enchanted
